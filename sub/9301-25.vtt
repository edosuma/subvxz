WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:16.849 --> 01:18.146
Feel any better?

01:18.384 --> 01:19.510
A little.

01:20.553 --> 01:22.612
Nice to know you have a weakness.

01:22.888 --> 01:24.947
Allergies are not a weakness!

01:25.157 --> 01:26.181
[sneeze]

01:26.592 --> 01:28.355
They're just allergies!

01:28.661 --> 01:30.390
Never been this bad though.

01:30.529 --> 01:32.292
Emergency. Emergency.

01:32.598 --> 01:35.226
-Emergency.
-Information, please.

01:35.501 --> 01:37.799
The Dam of the Ancients has burst.

01:38.070 --> 01:39.935
Flooding of the fertile plain.

01:40.306 --> 01:41.830
Crops in peril.

01:42.041 --> 01:43.941
Farmers in great danger.

01:44.110 --> 01:45.509
I'll go immediately.

01:46.078 --> 01:48.342
I better stay here to guard the palace.

01:48.547 --> 01:50.208
C'mon, Cringer.

01:51.450 --> 01:52.861
Where are you two going?

01:52.886 --> 01:54.214
Ah, I just remembered

01:54.238 --> 01:55.238
something I have to do.

01:56.655 --> 01:58.182
You always have something

01:58.207 --> 01:59.978
to do, when there's trouble.

02:01.560 --> 02:02.652
In here, Cringer.

02:03.462 --> 02:05.521
Great place for a nap.

02:06.198 --> 02:07.290
Later, pal.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.900
You mean...?
-I mean...

02:10.035 --> 02:12.299
By the power of Grayskull!

02:17.743 --> 02:21.304
I have the power!

02:39.698 --> 02:40.960
It won't start, Rammy.

02:43.135 --> 02:46.036
Weeds!
Where'd all this stuff come from?

02:46.438 --> 02:48.702
I don't know,
but there's no time to clean it out now.

02:49.141 --> 02:52.042
I better take the Small Trak.
-He-Man!

02:52.378 --> 02:53.479
Hello, Rammy.

02:53.479 --> 02:54.878
Need a had, Man-At-Arms?

02:55.114 --> 02:56.741
You bet, He-Man. Let's go.

03:06.725 --> 03:07.953
Battle Cat, look there.

03:08.661 --> 03:10.356
Help!  Help!

03:10.829 --> 03:12.091
Can you handle it, Cat?

03:12.298 --> 03:13.560
No problem.

03:21.974 --> 03:23.271
-Yeah! -Yay!

03:27.546 --> 03:28.945
Hurray!

03:29.715 --> 03:31.649
There's the problem, straight ahead.

03:32.051 --> 03:33.695
Maybe an avalanche would make

03:33.720 --> 03:35.476
a new dam and stop the water.

03:35.621 --> 03:36.747
Too dangerous.

03:36.989 --> 03:39.014
Try a pile of small stones.

03:39.191 --> 03:41.159
Here goes.  We'll try low power.

03:45.864 --> 03:47.058
It's working.  Look!

03:51.303 --> 03:52.793
Okay.  What next?

03:57.046 --> 03:58.979
I'll just... give it a whirl.

04:01.814 --> 04:03.338
Hey, oh...

04:03.549 --> 04:05.250
of course he's making a tornado

04:05.275 --> 04:06.974
to gather up the small rocks.

04:15.427 --> 04:16.257
Yay!

04:16.894 --> 04:17.793
Hurray!

04:21.367 --> 04:22.840
...and you say this hooded man,

04:22.865 --> 04:24.622
sold you the seeds, only yesterday?

04:25.871 --> 04:27.600
Yes, it was nearly sundown.

04:28.207 --> 04:29.970
A kind of plant, he said.

04:30.209 --> 04:31.506
Good for everything that grows.

04:31.710 --> 04:34.270
He said we should try some by the dam.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.971
But this morning,
the vines were growing...

04:37.149 --> 04:39.275
all over, spreading all across the dam.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.574
Starting to destroy it.

04:40.786 --> 04:42.754
If only we'd realized in time.

04:44.023 --> 04:45.622
We tried to pull them out but

04:45.647 --> 04:47.244
they were growing too fast.

04:47.426 --> 04:49.189
There's much work to be done here.

04:49.395 --> 04:50.819
Our farms are destroyed.

04:50.844 --> 04:52.980
Weeds are springing
up everywhere.

04:53.132 --> 04:56.124
But at least the big danger has passed.
Thanks to He-Man.

04:56.735 --> 04:58.498
I'd like to stay and help.

04:58.737 --> 04:59.999
We would be honored.

05:00.172 --> 05:01.626
I'd like to hear more about

05:01.651 --> 05:03.427
this hooded seed man, of yours.

05:07.646 --> 05:09.189
I feel the boney finger of

05:09.214 --> 05:11.231
Skeletor, don't you, Battle Cat?

05:12.117 --> 05:13.106
Sorceress!

05:13.319 --> 05:16.618
Waste no time, He-Man.
Return to the palace.

05:16.955 --> 05:18.532
That's where we're headed now.

05:18.557 --> 05:19.345
What's wrong?

05:19.458 --> 05:21.421
Hurry, waste no time.

05:22.061 --> 05:23.289
We're on our way.

05:30.869 --> 05:33.337
What in the name of Eternia, is going on?

05:35.107 --> 05:37.507
It just started.
We gotta do something.

05:37.643 --> 05:39.736
Find the King and Queen, fast.

05:39.945 --> 05:41.810
Look in the rooms down the hall.

05:49.555 --> 05:51.716
What kind of magic is this?

05:52.858 --> 05:54.291
He-Man, in here!

05:54.560 --> 05:55.390
This way!

05:58.764 --> 06:00.664
He-Man, do something.

06:01.967 --> 06:03.332
A man came...

06:03.535 --> 06:05.298
wearing a black hood.

06:05.437 --> 06:07.337
And he gave you some seeds?

06:07.506 --> 06:10.600
How did you know?
Been doing my homework.

06:11.543 --> 06:13.511
Cut the others free and follow me.

06:13.645 --> 06:14.737
Where are you going?

06:14.913 --> 06:16.813
The throne room. The palace is collapsing.

06:17.182 --> 06:18.581
Teela, hurry!

06:21.286 --> 06:24.050
Urh... I can't hold it much longer.

06:24.490 --> 06:27.152
Oh, y-you have to,
or the whole place will fall in.

06:31.263 --> 06:32.457
They're pulling back.

06:37.770 --> 06:39.004
Are you alright?

06:39.004 --> 06:41.029
Yes, but Teela, the King and Queen?

06:48.380 --> 06:49.847
Where is everybody?

06:49.948 --> 06:52.178
I sure don't like what's happening.

06:52.317 --> 06:53.147
Neither do I.

06:56.388 --> 06:58.413
To Castle Grayskull !

06:59.892 --> 07:01.985
What's the matter with this thing?

07:06.899 --> 07:09.800
Vines are sapping my strength.

07:10.035 --> 07:14.028
Sorceress, hear me.
We need help.

07:16.608 --> 07:20.100
I'm losing them.
Vines must be tightening.

07:20.446 --> 07:22.505
I must concentrate harder.

07:23.148 --> 07:24.809
I must bring them here.

07:31.390 --> 07:32.288
Sorceress.

07:33.959 --> 07:35.430
You used the Space Portal

07:35.455 --> 07:37.043
to bring us here.
Thanks.

07:37.196 --> 07:39.494
Where is my mother and father?
And Teela?

07:39.631 --> 07:43.533
Did you bring them too?
-No, the vines were too strong.

07:43.635 --> 07:45.262
But your magic is powerful.

07:45.471 --> 07:47.701
Yes, but not powerful enough.

07:47.906 --> 07:49.897
I'll bet Skeletor's behind this.

07:50.075 --> 07:52.270
How will you find out?
-We'll ask him.

07:52.411 --> 07:55.812
We can use the Window of Spirits
to contact Skeletor.

07:55.981 --> 07:57.608
Did they say Skeletor?

08:02.654 --> 08:07.614
He-Man? What manner of sorcery
comes from Grayskull this day?

08:07.926 --> 08:10.724
Suppose you start off by telling
me what you've done with the...

08:10.863 --> 08:13.229
plants. Then I'd like to know
what you've done with Queen

08:13.398 --> 08:16.196
Marlena? Then...
-Back up, Muscle-boy!.

08:16.468 --> 08:18.527
I want to know what
you've done to the plants.

08:18.737 --> 08:19.203
Me?

08:19.404 --> 08:22.635
Yes, because they're bugging
the big bones out of me.

08:24.343 --> 08:25.863
Did you see that?

08:25.888 --> 08:27.661
The stuff's all over the place.

08:28.380 --> 08:30.348
I can't get rid of them, Skeletor.

08:30.516 --> 08:31.949
Keep trying!

08:35.453 --> 08:38.183
Oh no, Skeletor, they won't stop.

08:39.091 --> 08:40.970
Well, He-Man, if you didn't do it,

08:40.995 --> 08:43.542
then who in the great-boned
world, did do it?

08:43.929 --> 08:45.226
He-Man, answer me!

08:45.531 --> 08:47.897
He-Man,
I demand that you return to this screen.

08:49.501 --> 08:51.128
Skeletor, you're fading out.

08:51.403 --> 08:52.495
Wait a minute.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.400
Who are you?

08:56.542 --> 08:59.471
I, am Evilseed.

08:59.511 --> 09:01.672
Master of the Plant Kingdom,

09:01.680 --> 09:03.614
and I'm taking over.

09:06.351 --> 09:08.216
And you, bone head...

09:08.654 --> 09:11.009
all the miserable treasure you

09:11.034 --> 09:13.544
have, that shall be mine also.

09:13.659 --> 09:14.659
No!

09:14.993 --> 09:16.961
Look, he's on top of the dam.

09:17.129 --> 09:19.654
Now hear me, all of you.

09:20.065 --> 09:23.523
My plants and I have slept for years.

09:23.702 --> 09:27.331
Now we waken to claim Eternia.

09:28.340 --> 09:30.833
Behold, my sturdy tree.

09:30.876 --> 09:35.007
Behold, it's strange fruit.

09:40.719 --> 09:42.983
Wait, Evilseed, don't go!

09:43.188 --> 09:45.520
Perhaps we can make a deal of some kind.

09:46.391 --> 09:47.653
Oh, he's gone.

09:47.826 --> 09:50.090
Who does that cabbage think he is?

09:50.495 --> 09:52.156
Here comes the vines again.

09:53.465 --> 09:55.524
It won't stop.

09:55.834 --> 09:57.233
Skeletor...

09:57.469 --> 10:00.346
Help me.
Skeletor, help me, please!

10:00.371 --> 10:01.429
Skeletor!

10:01.506 --> 10:03.997
Sorry, but I've got to help myself.

10:04.976 --> 10:07.308
I need time to make a plan.

10:07.445 --> 10:11.905
Mer-Man! Mer-Man, your assistance
is required on Snake Mountain...

10:12.116 --> 10:13.845
and I mean right now!

10:14.185 --> 10:16.755
I'm under attack here, Skeletor.

10:16.780 --> 10:18.305
Seaweed gone mad!

10:18.489 --> 10:21.551
Everything collapsing.
Send help.

10:22.461 --> 10:25.294
Are you crazy? I can hardly help myself.

10:25.464 --> 10:30.197
Skeletor, if there's a good bone in
you, send help!

10:30.402 --> 10:33.428
There isn't!
Never has been, never will be.

10:33.639 --> 10:38.406
The question is: how long can I hold out.

10:41.580 --> 10:46.745
Give up, He-Man,
the days of man and magic are past.

10:47.285 --> 10:49.879
Give up, while you can.

10:50.889 --> 10:54.290
Never! Not until I send
you back where you belong.

10:54.593 --> 11:00.054
Too bad. I have spared your
Castle Grayskull, long enough.

11:08.273 --> 11:10.264
Evilseed really means business.

11:10.475 --> 11:11.271
Yes.

11:11.476 --> 11:13.068
His power is growing.

11:13.345 --> 11:15.745
Sorceress, you must have
something to test that power.

11:16.214 --> 11:20.412
I do. We'll take that vine to
my laboratory and analyze it.

11:20.719 --> 11:23.552
Good idea.
Now we're doing something, but...

11:23.689 --> 11:26.180
I wonder what Evilseed's doing?

11:26.491 --> 11:28.925
Rise!  Rise!

11:29.294 --> 11:31.854
Castle Grayskull awaits us.

11:32.330 --> 11:35.356
Look and behold your future.

11:36.001 --> 11:40.267
It's only water you big, big...
Oh, whatever you are!

11:40.405 --> 11:42.396
Evil-Lyn,
if you don't stop babbling...

11:42.774 --> 11:44.233
I think we should all be quiet.

11:44.258 --> 11:46.234
We're not doing ourselves any good by...

11:46.478 --> 11:47.467
Silence!

11:50.282 --> 11:53.046
It's a plant not known anywhere on Eternia.

11:53.218 --> 11:55.812
-Then what is it?
I don't know even that.

11:56.021 --> 11:57.454
Then we don't know how to stop him.

11:59.291 --> 12:00.662
There must be some way,

12:00.687 --> 12:02.341
I can take advantage of this situation.

12:02.794 --> 12:05.558
Trap-Jaw, where are you?
-Right behind ya.

12:05.764 --> 12:08.494
Oh, don't just stand there.
Think of something.

12:11.369 --> 12:13.667
Call He-Man.
-He-Man, why?

12:14.306 --> 12:16.536
The way things are going,
you might need him.

12:16.808 --> 12:20.073
Me... need He-Man?
Never!

12:23.648 --> 12:26.674
But maybe he will need me.

12:27.052 --> 12:29.350
Wait a minute.
Let's take this step by step.

12:29.654 --> 12:31.123
What's the one thing...

12:31.123 --> 12:32.954
plants need to stay healthy and grow.

12:33.291 --> 12:34.121
Water,

12:34.659 --> 12:36.559
and the way these grow...

12:36.828 --> 12:38.227
They must need a lot.

12:38.563 --> 12:42.055
Hey, that's why the dam is
so important to Evilseed.

12:42.167 --> 12:44.152
Right, once the dam breaks,

12:44.177 --> 12:45.957
the plants will have
all the water they need.

12:46.204 --> 12:48.578
True, but there's one

12:48.603 --> 12:50.722
simple thing we haven't tried.

12:52.444 --> 12:53.934
See what happens?

12:54.112 --> 12:56.876
Like most plants,
it cannot grow when it is cold.

12:57.549 --> 13:00.347
- We could use a freeze ray?
Orko, there aren't enough freeze...

13:00.519 --> 13:02.646
rays in Eternia to stop Evilseed.

13:02.921 --> 13:06.288
Then, it must snow and it must snow today.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.718
Snow? Here on Eternia?

13:09.027 --> 13:10.255
And today? That's impossible.

13:10.595 --> 13:11.562
Maybe not.

13:11.797 --> 13:14.630
Suppose we got a giant ice ball
from the Ice Mountains...

13:14.766 --> 13:15.994
and smashed it in the sky...

13:16.168 --> 13:18.534
There is only one way, it might work.

13:19.004 --> 13:22.064
We must do it above Castle Grayskull.

13:22.274 --> 13:24.401
And we must join our powers.

13:24.709 --> 13:28.236
Why Grayskull?
-It is a place of great power.

13:28.647 --> 13:31.878
It's where I get my magic
and He-Man gets his strength.

13:32.017 --> 13:33.882
Our powers are strongest right here.

13:34.052 --> 13:37.488
Alright, Grayskull it is.
I'll get that ice.

13:37.889 --> 13:40.016
Wait, there is one more thing.

13:40.525 --> 13:43.221
Besides your power and mine...

13:43.562 --> 13:46.360
We may need a power of one other.

13:46.498 --> 13:49.467
One other? There isn't one other.
Unless...

13:49.601 --> 13:51.364
-You mean don't mean... -Yes.

13:51.469 --> 13:52.868
The powers of the three

13:52.893 --> 13:54.656
greatest forces in Eternia.

13:54.873 --> 13:55.805
He-Man's...

13:56.107 --> 13:56.937
mine...

13:57.475 --> 13:58.942
and Skeletor.

13:59.845 --> 14:01.608
Oh.
-I'll call him.

14:03.081 --> 14:06.517
Unite with Castle Grayskull?
Never!

14:06.651 --> 14:08.881
Never will I set foot in Castle Grayskull

14:09.020 --> 14:11.318
until the day I enter as it's conqueror.

14:11.656 --> 14:13.089
Begone, He-Man!

14:13.525 --> 14:15.288
Have ya lost your knucklejoints?

14:16.661 --> 14:17.787
We need him!

14:18.730 --> 14:22.359
But don't you see, fool? He-Man is beaten.

14:22.534 --> 14:24.661
The man is beaten by the plants.

14:24.936 --> 14:27.029
Well, we're not doing so hot ourselves.

14:27.372 --> 14:29.567
We will play a waiting game.

14:29.774 --> 14:32.868
Let him beg, then we'll deal.

14:33.178 --> 14:36.045
Sorry, the game's over.
I'm out of freeze rays.

14:36.314 --> 14:37.747
You blundering fool!

14:38.516 --> 14:40.211
Help, Skeletor!

14:40.852 --> 14:44.219
Sorry, Trap-Jaw.
I must think of myself, not you.

14:46.958 --> 14:48.755
He-Man?  Are you there?

14:49.861 --> 14:52.523
He-Man!  I am calling...

14:53.698 --> 14:55.190
as a friend.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.568
I am ready to come to Grayskull.

15:00.305 --> 15:02.273
When Skeletor comes to Grayskull,

15:02.298 --> 15:04.322
then his powers will increase too.

15:04.476 --> 15:07.274
Yes,
he will be stronger than ever before.

15:07.545 --> 15:10.639
That's bad news. Bad... bad news.

15:10.982 --> 15:14.008
We're not enemies right now.
We're on the same side.

15:14.185 --> 15:16.085
I say, we can't trust him.

15:16.288 --> 15:17.949
But, Orko, we have no choice.

15:18.089 --> 15:19.579
To the Space Portal.

15:21.826 --> 15:23.664
The water has risen.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.342
And all is ready.

15:25.697 --> 15:28.034
This time there will be no interference

15:28.059 --> 15:30.454
from the heroes and villains of Eternia.

15:30.835 --> 15:34.430
This time there shall be only... Evilseed.

15:35.140 --> 15:36.505
Orko will stay here.

15:36.641 --> 15:39.441
Me? Here? With Skeletor?

15:39.977 --> 15:41.022
Ack!

15:41.046 --> 15:42.513
It's alright, Orko.

15:43.114 --> 15:44.604
Oh sure.

15:45.450 --> 15:46.478
It is beginning.

15:46.551 --> 15:48.018
To the Ice Mountains...

15:48.186 --> 15:51.019
and bring me back the moment this runs out.

15:55.527 --> 15:57.164
Eternia.

15:57.189 --> 15:58.962
Now witness.

15:58.987 --> 16:01.304
The destruction of the dam begins.

16:01.499 --> 16:04.593
The water will soon, feed my plants.

16:14.446 --> 16:16.846
So he is now up Ice Mountain...

16:17.015 --> 16:18.846
and when He-Man is finished...

16:19.017 --> 16:21.611
We will bring him back, at the last moment.

16:21.786 --> 16:23.413
An interesting plan.

16:23.688 --> 16:26.213
But supposing, we don't bring him back.

16:27.459 --> 16:28.721
Oh no.

16:39.337 --> 16:41.971
Well, here goes everything.

16:52.517 --> 16:53.950
If my calculations are correct...

16:54.119 --> 16:57.646
that Ice Ball will be over
Castle Grayskull in 60 seconds.

16:57.989 --> 16:59.923
Come on, Sorceress, do your stuff.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.708
With the added power of Grayskull,

17:04.733 --> 17:06.877
my magic is as strong as yours.

17:07.031 --> 17:09.465
Admit defeat.
-You are a fool.

17:09.968 --> 17:12.163
You must let me bring He-Man back.

17:12.369 --> 17:13.803
He-Man?  Never!

17:14.039 --> 17:16.200
Castle Grayskull is mine.

17:16.608 --> 17:18.127
Then look behind you.

17:18.153 --> 17:20.032
You take me for a fool?

17:21.413 --> 17:23.744
Come on, Sorceress, do it.

17:24.549 --> 17:25.709
Open the Portal!

17:27.852 --> 17:28.716
Finally.

17:30.755 --> 17:31.779
Skeletor, hold still.

17:34.659 --> 17:36.092
How did it go with him?

17:36.294 --> 17:37.283
Everything went fine.

17:37.729 --> 17:41.426
Don't you get awfully tired
of being a hero, all the time?

17:43.768 --> 17:45.030
Look, the Ice Ball!

17:45.236 --> 17:47.704
To the tower.
There's not a moment to lose.

17:51.342 --> 17:53.674
Don't you ever feel like
doing something evil?

17:54.045 --> 17:57.310
Don't you ever feel like
doing something good?

18:00.118 --> 18:01.676
Now?
-Now.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.610
All join together.

18:04.222 --> 18:05.621
Orko, you too.

18:12.664 --> 18:14.359
We need more power.

18:14.499 --> 18:17.161
Skeletor,
raise your Havoc Staff.

18:17.335 --> 18:18.131
Now!

18:18.403 --> 18:20.200
It will be out of range soon.

18:20.405 --> 18:21.394
I dont know.

18:21.539 --> 18:24.269
If you don't, everything will be destroyed.

18:24.409 --> 18:25.205
Do it!

18:39.424 --> 18:40.152
Snow.

18:45.697 --> 18:46.925
Why, it can't be.

18:47.732 --> 18:50.997
This is my season. This is my time.

18:51.369 --> 18:54.805
I will be back, I will be back!

18:55.373 --> 18:57.102
There will be another season,

18:57.775 --> 18:59.174
yes... yes...

18:59.577 --> 19:02.478
there will be... another season.

19:09.954 --> 19:11.387
We did it, Skeletor.

19:11.556 --> 19:12.922
All of us working together,

19:12.947 --> 19:14.413
were able to stop Evilseed.

19:14.759 --> 19:16.130
Just think of all the other things

19:16.155 --> 19:17.251
we could do for humanity...

19:17.395 --> 19:18.658
by joining forces.

19:18.683 --> 19:20.718
Not a chance, Muscle-brain.

19:20.865 --> 19:22.600
I don't do things for humanity,

19:22.625 --> 19:23.687
I do them for me!

19:24.836 --> 19:28.272
Wait! I will control Eternia all by myself.

19:29.107 --> 19:30.482
Not as long as my friends

19:30.507 --> 19:32.100
and I are here to stop you.

19:32.977 --> 19:35.810
Maybe not this time, but I'll be back.

19:36.848 --> 19:38.406
Count on it.

19:40.585 --> 19:42.451
I don't get it.
Why doesn't Skeletor

19:42.476 --> 19:44.340
use his powers to do something good.

19:44.856 --> 19:47.825
Orko, some people are just blind.

19:48.059 --> 19:50.027
They don't know right from wrong.

19:50.195 --> 19:51.506
When I do something wrong,

19:51.531 --> 19:53.245
Man-At-Arms sends me to my room.

19:53.398 --> 19:55.366
Too bad it's not that easy with Skeletor.

19:55.700 --> 19:58.260
You know, that's not a bad idea idea, Orko.

19:58.469 --> 19:59.265
It's not?

19:59.704 --> 20:01.865
Next time Skeletor does something wrong...

20:02.006 --> 20:03.268
We'll send him to your room.

20:03.808 --> 20:04.740
My room?

20:04.876 --> 20:06.352
From what Man-At-Arms tells me,

20:06.377 --> 20:07.994
your room is such a mess that...

20:08.146 --> 20:09.875
Skeletor would never find his way out.

20:10.081 --> 20:11.267
All right, all right,

20:11.292 --> 20:13.097
I'll go clean it up right now.

20:13.218 --> 20:14.776
You wanna help me?

20:14.953 --> 20:16.352
Glad to, my little friend.

20:19.157 --> 20:20.556
Don't wait for us.

20:20.692 --> 20:23.820
I have a feeling we're going to be a while.

20:28.866 --> 20:30.735
Today was a day for surprises

20:30.735 --> 20:32.357
and the biggest one of all was

20:32.382 --> 20:34.490
Skeletor and He-Man working together.

20:34.639 --> 20:36.547
By joining their powers, He-Man and

20:36.572 --> 20:38.531
Skeletor were able to stop Evilseed.

20:43.481 --> 20:44.936
Working with others can

20:44.961 --> 20:46.517
sometimes be difficult.

20:46.517 --> 20:47.655
But if you listen to and

20:47.680 --> 20:49.101
respect the ideas of others,

20:49.287 --> 20:50.948
even when you don't agree with them,

20:51.122 --> 20:52.919
you'll find it easier to get the job done.

20:53.091 --> 20:53.795
And who knows,

20:53.820 --> 20:55.379
you may even learn something.
