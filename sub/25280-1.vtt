01:06.066 --> 01:10.904
To return so triumphantly is
a dream I thought I would never achieve.

01:10.987 --> 01:15.950
We are one step closer to bringing peace
and prosperity to the entire universe.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.411
This is all because of you, Princess.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.246
We did it together, Lotor.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.791
I would have never even known
of Oriande without you,

01:22.874 --> 01:25.293
and therefore could have never
unlocked its secrets.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.678
We'll see intel
in your briefing

01:35.762 --> 01:37.055
and decide what to do.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.141
- Maybe we can--
- Lotor.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.018
Oh, no.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.896
Uh... who the heck are you?

01:44.979 --> 01:49.400
How dare you speak to me without
authorization from Blood Emperor Lotor.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.652
Ow!

01:50.735 --> 01:52.821
She was my governess.

01:53.363 --> 01:57.909
No one has used the term "Blood Emperor"
since before we were a star-faring race.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.828
And these are my colleagues.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.622
They have more than my permission
to speak.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.415
Everyone, this is Dayak.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.335
-Hi.
-A pleasure.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.547
-Hiya.
-Hello.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.756
Nice to meet you.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.259
So, to what do we owe the honor?

02:14.342 --> 02:18.221
Word of your victory at the Kral Zera
has spread throughout the empire.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.099
I always knew you had it in you
to crush your enemies.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.143
Dayak's raised you from a child to a man,

02:23.226 --> 02:26.062
and now I'll witness your ascension
to the throne.

02:27.480 --> 02:31.359
Wait, she raised you from a child?
Aww, is this your nanny?

02:31.442 --> 02:33.820
-Governess.
-You have a nanny!

02:33.903 --> 02:36.197
Is she going to read you bedtime stories?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.867
Is she gonna rock you to sleep?
Is she gonna--? Ow!

02:38.950 --> 02:41.035
I instructed Lotor
in the ways of the Galra.

02:41.119 --> 02:46.749
The history of our conquests, our customs,
battle philosophy, the art of war.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.960
Hmm, Galra customs, huh?

02:49.544 --> 02:52.172
Is that like when you guys say
"vrepit sa" and stuff?

02:52.255 --> 02:54.090
There's so much we don't know about you.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.551
If you're interested
in our society's history,

02:56.634 --> 02:58.761
you couldn't find
a better teacher than Dayak.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.763
What Lotor says is true.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.349
Oh, wow. Would you really teach me
about the Galra?

03:03.433 --> 03:05.268
What you wanna know
about the Galra for?

03:05.351 --> 03:08.771
We're gonna be working with Lotor to
bring peace through the empire, right?

03:08.855 --> 03:11.774
Makes sense the more we know
about their society, the better.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.818
If you are to learn the ways of the Galra,

03:13.902 --> 03:17.697
be prepared for the most challenging trial
you could ever undertake.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.824
There will be no turning back.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.327
Victory or death.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.787
Uh, oh, that's okay.

03:24.871 --> 03:29.709
Hunk, you're a Paladin of Voltron.
There is no challenge too great for you.

03:31.085 --> 03:34.464
-Will I learn what "vrepit sa" means?
-Yes.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.049
Let's do it!

03:39.093 --> 03:40.929
Let's get to that briefing.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.932
The civil war continues unimpeded.

03:44.015 --> 03:47.727
More and more Galra forces
are leaving to join other factions.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.438
Sendak has claimed the most deserters.

03:50.521 --> 03:53.524
They call themselves
"the Fire of Purification."

03:54.108 --> 03:58.988
It is time I address all Galra
and make my claim as emperor absolute.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.366
Is that going to start with you
freeing planets?

04:01.449 --> 04:06.037
It's not that easy.
My grip on the empire is tenuous as is.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.165
I need to proffer an alternative
to our current state.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.001
That's why it is so important
that Allura and I gain access

04:12.085 --> 04:13.336
to the quintessence field.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.672
Are we to focus all of our energy on that?

04:15.755 --> 04:16.964
It is paramount.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.759
However, we cannot let the empire
fall apart.

04:19.841 --> 04:22.887
I will address my people
at the astral conflux.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.395
How is holding these weights
gonna help me learn Galra history?

04:30.478 --> 04:31.688
-Palen-bol!
-Ow!

04:31.771 --> 04:34.232
For the mind to learn,
the body must be broken.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.402
-Broken? Seems a little drastic.
- Palen-bol!

04:37.485 --> 04:39.320
Ow! What does that mean?

04:39.404 --> 04:41.948
It means "the enlightening pain."

04:42.031 --> 04:45.785
But apparently there is not enough pain
to make you enlightened yet.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.579
-So you're gonna hurt me until I'm smart?
-Yes!

04:48.663 --> 04:49.706
Aww.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.420
The Galra race started as a nation tribe
on planet Daibazaal,

04:55.503 --> 04:58.381
home to many warring races at the time.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.467
In the war to annihilate
the opposing tribes,

05:01.551 --> 05:04.304
the Galra formed a phalanx
of their bravest

05:04.387 --> 05:08.099
and made a spear-like attack
to the heart of their foes.

05:08.599 --> 05:12.895
It was known as the Killing Thrust,
or Vrepit Sa.

05:12.979 --> 05:17.025
Oh, so that's what Vrepit Sa means?
"Killing Thrust"? That's so violent.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.401
-Palen-bol!
-Ow!

05:18.985 --> 05:20.820
Yes, it is violent.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.239
The Galra believe combat
is the searing light

05:23.323 --> 05:26.743
that burns away imperfections
on every level,

05:26.826 --> 05:28.870
from personal to societal.

05:29.537 --> 05:34.375
-Cool. Can't I maybe take a break?
-Breaks? There are no breaks!

05:34.459 --> 05:38.171
Your training is finished when you have
learned all pain has to teach you.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.840
Oh, man. That's so intense.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.718
If you decide
to leave your training early,

05:43.801 --> 05:46.262
it is an insult to my teaching.

05:46.345 --> 05:50.808
An insult that can only be settled
by a fight to the death.

05:50.892 --> 05:54.145
So you're saying a fight to the death
is the only way out of this?

05:54.645 --> 05:58.066
Ow! Okay, yeah, you just said that.
I guess I am getting smarter.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.944
You must replicate
your father's work

06:02.028 --> 06:04.947
if we are to use this ship
to enter the quintessence field.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.076
-But how?
-Something you learned in Oriande.

06:08.159 --> 06:12.163
Something your father learned
to become the superior alchemist he was.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.624
How he built Voltron is the key.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.541
My lord.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.128
It is time to prepare for your speech.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.215
It seems my empire needs me.
Please continue.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.058
Galra brothers and sisters,

06:32.141 --> 06:36.938
I am your emperor, Lotor,
son and successor of Zarkon.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.731
Slayer of a tyrant,

06:38.815 --> 06:42.568
child raised in the void
and taught on the battlefield.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.614
There are rumors of doubt
regarding my leadership.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.742
Do not let them poison your ears.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.369
Pledge loyalty to me,

06:51.452 --> 06:56.249
and I will deliver the Galra Empire
unto times of untold prosperity.

06:56.332 --> 06:59.335
An age of unlimited quintessence,

06:59.418 --> 07:02.839
the likes of which this universe
has never known.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.967
Commander, radiation belt approaching.

07:06.050 --> 07:09.762
-Soon I will raise our grand empire
-Initiate shield.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.890
above the indigence and violence
of its past

07:12.974 --> 07:17.103
up to new heights of peace
and limitless possibility.

07:17.186 --> 07:21.274
Those factions that splintered from
the empire will pay for their treachery.

07:21.357 --> 07:25.319
I urge you now,
send me your messages of fealty.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.990
Those who choose to turn their backs
on their emperor...

07:29.073 --> 07:32.118
will find themselves
lost to the sands of history,

07:32.201 --> 07:34.704
unremembered and unmourned.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.499
You can't possibly be thinking
about pledging to him.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.461
And what's all that about
becoming a peaceful empire?

07:41.544 --> 07:44.589
-He's too weak to be our emperor.
-Enough.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.424
Lotor lit the flame.

07:46.507 --> 07:51.220
We are honor-bound to do as he says,
even if it is... strange.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.015
We will be pledging to Lotor.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.975
You're weak, too.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.478
Maybe I didn't make myself clear,
Lieutenant Lahn.

07:58.561 --> 08:02.440
I'm in charge of this shielding facility,
my word is law.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.027
Aye, sir.

08:06.694 --> 08:10.781
Shield at 85 percent.
Next radiation event in three vargas.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.873
Recharge and prepare
for the next radiation sequence.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.751
Open a hailing frequency to Galra command.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.045
Sir, hostile ships incoming.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.841
Sending a message to Lotor, are we?

08:28.925 --> 08:32.303
And to think,
I came here to offer you a chance

08:32.385 --> 08:35.722
to serve in the Fire of Purification.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.517
Fire the ion cannon.

08:47.401 --> 08:48.528
Ow! Ow!

08:49.111 --> 08:50.446
I did everything you told me!

08:50.530 --> 08:53.783
Yes, but that doughy face
of yours is very un-Galra.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.826
It's just my face!

08:57.787 --> 08:58.621
Ha!

09:03.876 --> 09:04.877
Very good.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.464
-Owwie!
-Showing complacency?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.840
-Palen-bol!
-Ow, ow, ow!

09:12.051 --> 09:13.970
The planet has already been fired upon

09:14.053 --> 09:16.389
and we do not have the means
to protect ourselves.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.724
You must send assistance immediately.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.851
-Understood.
-What's going on?

09:21.727 --> 09:26.023
One of our labor planets is under attack
from Sendak and his fleet.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.776
Sendak? Not that guy again.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.945
We've got to help that planet immediately.

09:31.028 --> 09:34.824
Sendak would have me respond
to his attack and neglect my empire.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.994
Voltron can handle this
while you continue to rule.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.788
But, Princess, I need you here.
Without you--

09:40.871 --> 09:44.083
Your plan has waited this long.
It can wait a tick longer.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.711
We must protect your innocent subjects.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.006
Of course. You're right.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.882
We will return as soon as we can.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.637
Looks like I'm gonna
have to cut my training short.

09:56.721 --> 10:00.016
You dishonor me. A fight to the death!

10:00.600 --> 10:03.185
Okay, well, I've got to go
with them right now.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.398
But maybe we can put a pin in that?
Reschedule for tomorrow? Or never?

10:10.192 --> 10:12.945
Hey, Dayak isn't really gonna fight me
to the death, is she?

10:13.904 --> 10:15.031
Is she?

10:15.114 --> 10:16.574
She seemed pretty serious.

10:16.657 --> 10:19.493
But I bet if you ask Lotor nicely,
he can have her exiled.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.578
Oh, that'd be nice.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.705
I'm not really in the mood
to die, you know?

10:22.788 --> 10:26.417
Uh, speaking of, anyone else scared
that we're to face Sendak?

10:26.500 --> 10:29.045
Sendak "who almost took
all the Lions" Sendak?

10:29.128 --> 10:32.381
And who basically came back
from the dead Sendak, that guy?

10:32.465 --> 10:35.843
Come on, Hunk. We're Paladins.
We got this. Right, Shiro?

10:35.926 --> 10:38.304
Shiro?

10:39.263 --> 10:41.974
Pidge is right.
Let's focus on our mission.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.236
Take heed.

10:54.320 --> 10:59.200
Galra citizens who side with Lotor
will be destroyed.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.473
Here at your new master's bidding?

11:31.690 --> 11:33.401
We've arrived at the coordinates.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.195
We can't go any further
without losing power.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.739
Stay on course.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.499
Shiro, are you all right?

11:48.582 --> 11:50.418
I'm fine.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.337
Come on, team, let's form Voltron!

12:43.387 --> 12:45.389
Sir, cannons aimed at Voltron.

12:46.348 --> 12:49.602
No. Aim them
at the shield station.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.981
I know your true weakness.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.901
That you value the lives of others.

12:56.984 --> 13:02.615
And I will hammer that weakness
until you are crushed beneath my heel.

13:16.170 --> 13:20.090
No! Without those panels in place,
the planet will be fully exposed!

13:20.174 --> 13:21.091
Which means?

13:21.175 --> 13:23.177
No protection
from radiation bands!

13:23.844 --> 13:25.888
The entire planet is doomed.

13:26.764 --> 13:30.267
Take us out of here. We've won the day.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.689
We can't let him get away!

13:35.773 --> 13:39.485
There's no time. We've gotta fix
that shield as soon as--!

13:49.286 --> 13:51.997
-Shiro, are you all right?
-I'm fine.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.124
We can't leave that planet unprotected.

13:58.671 --> 14:02.132
We are the Paladins of Voltron,
working with Emperor Lotor.

14:02.216 --> 14:05.719
We're here to help you.
What is the status of your shield system?

14:06.303 --> 14:08.222
Paladins, I am Commander Bogh.

14:08.305 --> 14:11.183
Our damage report indicates
that a plate has been fractured.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.811
Our generator is offline
and needs rebooting.

14:13.894 --> 14:17.982
Other plates have shifted out of their
harnessing and must be repositioned.

14:18.065 --> 14:21.527
Only five doboshes
until the next solar sequence.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.405
You're engineer, Hunk.
How should we handle this?

14:24.488 --> 14:27.324
We need to split up.
Pidge, you handle the generator system.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.201
I'm gonna need Shiro to come with me.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.161
I can use his arm
to power the mainframe.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.079
Okay, good.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.665
Allura, Lance,
re-fuse that fractured plate.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.125
-Affirmative.
-You got it!

14:36.208 --> 14:40.129
-I'm gonna try to get the plates aligned.
-Okay. We've got our orders. Let's move!

15:07.114 --> 15:08.782
Where's this plate need to be lined?

15:09.408 --> 15:13.871
You're moving plate 7-2.
It needs to be aligned with plate 8-1.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.582
Got it, but those other plates
are out of position.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.751
There's no way I'll move them all myself.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.712
I can activate the manual thrusters
on some of the plates.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.172
It will be slow-going, but I--

15:23.255 --> 15:26.884
First you side with Lotor
and get our system attacked by Sendak.

15:26.967 --> 15:30.888
Then you willfully work with Voltron,
our sworn enemies!

15:30.971 --> 15:33.265
Get to your station
and begin the thrust sequence.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.642
That's an order!

15:35.559 --> 15:37.353
Are you freaking kidding me?

15:37.436 --> 15:38.646
Palen-bol!

15:38.729 --> 15:40.314
-Huh?
-Huh?

15:40.397 --> 15:42.024
You're both a dishonor.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.944
Do you fight for yourselves
or do you fight for the Galra?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.153
-Galra!
-Galra!

15:46.236 --> 15:49.073
Then victory or death!
Enough of the bickering!

15:49.657 --> 15:52.368
We're going to die
because of Commander Bogh.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.036
You know, long ago,

15:54.119 --> 15:57.456
there was a desperate group of Galra
that thought they were going to die.

15:57.539 --> 16:00.376
They executed a spear-like attack
known as the Killing Thrust.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.087
Those soldiers knew what it meant
to put life on the line.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.338
They won the day.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.466
Are you ready to put aside
your differences and fight with me?

16:07.549 --> 16:09.593
-Vrepit Sa!
-Vrepit Sa!

16:11.011 --> 16:12.972
I guess all that pain
did make me smarter.

16:15.683 --> 16:18.102
Pidge, I need you
to restore main shield power

16:18.185 --> 16:20.604
-to get gravitational harnessing going.
-We're on it.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.278
Okay, Shiro, let's jack your hand
into that terminal

16:28.362 --> 16:30.531
and we'll get this thing
running in no time.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.791
Okay, broken massive shield plate.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.585
Don't suppose there's a video
on how to fix this, is there?

16:43.669 --> 16:45.546
Make sure connection's straight.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.923
If it's even one degree off,
the shield will fail.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.591
That's not a tutorial!

16:49.675 --> 16:52.761
If you hold them in place,
then I could freeze them together.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.181
But I don't think the ice
will stand the radiation for very long.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.599
Maybe after you freeze them,

16:57.683 --> 16:59.852
I could use my heat ray
to weld them together.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.730
-Great idea, Lance!
-Aww. Thanks, Princess.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.647
Couldn't have thought of it
without you.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.858
Really, I think we make a great team.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.278
Here we are working together,
just the two of us.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.529
Let's go, Lance.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.621
This isn't going fast enough!

17:39.308 --> 17:41.310
They're all in place!

17:44.438 --> 17:45.898
That should hold them.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.943
Hope this works!

17:59.995 --> 18:00.996
We did it!

18:02.039 --> 18:03.624
Nice job, guys.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.879
Pidge, you ready?
We're almost at the radiation belt.

18:10.172 --> 18:13.425
Hold on.
I just need a few more minutes.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.448
Uh, guys, that radiation belt
is getting closer!

18:36.532 --> 18:39.576
Last piece in place.
Fire up that power, Pidge.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.552
Shield's up!

19:06.603 --> 19:08.438
Shiro, no!

19:14.611 --> 19:16.655
What's going on
with the plates?

19:21.368 --> 19:22.369
Allura!

19:26.415 --> 19:29.084
Aaah!

19:31.336 --> 19:32.337
Lance!

19:37.843 --> 19:39.845
Lance, please respond!

19:40.929 --> 19:43.015
The broken plate shorted out.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.767
Lance isn't responding,
Allura jumped out of her Lion...

19:45.851 --> 19:48.437
What else could possibly go wrong
right now?

19:50.981 --> 19:53.025
Pidge, what happened to the power?

19:53.108 --> 19:55.694
We're almost at the radiation belt.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.196
I know. I'm on it.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.698
Come on, Shiro.

20:05.662 --> 20:06.997
No.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.582
No, no!

20:36.652 --> 20:37.986
Let's try this again.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.326
Radiation exposure in four...

20:44.910 --> 20:47.037
- Pidge, hit it now!
- Three...

20:48.038 --> 20:49.539
Come on.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.624
Two...

20:52.876 --> 20:54.211
One...

21:23.073 --> 21:24.992
- Great job!
- It worked!

21:25.075 --> 21:26.785
Shielding complete.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.871
Recharge and prepare
for the next radiation sequence.

21:31.748 --> 21:32.749
Huh?

21:34.334 --> 21:35.711
You saved me.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.047
I owed you one.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.344
Thank you for reminding us
what it means to be Galra.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.596
-Vrepit Sa!
-Vrepit Sa!

21:46.680 --> 21:48.015
Vrepit Sa!

21:48.640 --> 21:50.892
Man, that's weird to say.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.984
Nice work out there, Hunk.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.445
That Galra training
really toughened you up.
