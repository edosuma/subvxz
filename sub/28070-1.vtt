A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:05.285 --> 01:06.685
Slow down.

01:10.365 --> 01:12.285
-Shall I stop?
-No.

01:27.965 --> 01:30.485
Romolo? It's Livia.

01:30.565 --> 01:32.125
I'm back.

01:32.205 --> 01:34.765
I need you to set up a meeting
with my brother.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.405
Where the fuck were you? Are you okay?

01:37.485 --> 01:38.485
Yes.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.525
- When do you want to meet?
-Tonight.

01:40.605 --> 01:42.445
Okay, where are you?

01:42.525 --> 01:43.765
I'm in Ostia.

01:43.845 --> 01:46.245
We've been looking for you
for three months.

01:46.325 --> 01:47.925
Speak to Aureliano.

01:48.005 --> 01:51.005
Okay, but don't disappear again.

01:51.565 --> 01:53.605
I'm not leaving again.

01:54.965 --> 01:56.645
Even if he wants to kill me.

01:57.845 --> 01:59.565
You really fucked up.

01:59.645 --> 02:01.005
Let me know.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.245
Aureliano!

02:26.405 --> 02:28.245
Your sister's back in Rome.

03:08.045 --> 03:09.805
All right.

03:11.725 --> 03:15.005
I told him.
Samurai's coming too.

03:18.205 --> 03:21.405
We'll put an end to this fucking business
once and for all.

03:50.485 --> 03:52.285
Good evening. Do you want a room?

03:52.365 --> 03:55.485
No. Tell me in which room is the woman
who is waiting for me.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.765
This woman.

04:03.045 --> 04:05.045
-I can't give you that information.
-No?

04:06.285 --> 04:08.765
I'll kill you like a dog.
Tell me where she is.

04:08.845 --> 04:10.245
She just arrived.

04:11.445 --> 04:12.605
Come on.

04:17.725 --> 04:18.725
Come on!

04:18.805 --> 04:20.125
-125.
-There you go.

05:17.005 --> 05:19.965
-Well?
-Nothing. She didn't show up.

05:20.405 --> 05:23.085
I'll keep looking.
I'll put someone out here.

05:26.045 --> 05:28.365
I've been waiting
for three months, Aureliano.

05:28.445 --> 05:29.725
Enough.

05:29.805 --> 05:32.285
I need your sister's signature
for that fucking land.

05:32.365 --> 05:34.805
I'm blocking everything now,
even what you've got.

05:34.885 --> 05:36.725
-Yeah, sure...
-No, you don't get it.

05:36.805 --> 05:39.565
Not an ounce of coke gets through.
You don't sell a fucking thing!

05:39.645 --> 05:41.405
You're out of business. You're done!

05:42.485 --> 05:43.765
That wasn't the deal.

05:43.845 --> 05:46.765
The deal was
that you'd give me that fucking land!

05:46.845 --> 05:48.565
Ostia doesn't belong to the Adamis!

05:49.845 --> 05:51.365
I made your father.

05:51.445 --> 05:55.165
And I'm the one deciding
to put another puppet in your place.

06:10.405 --> 06:12.365
[in Sinti]  [Glory to the Father,

06:12.445 --> 06:13.525
the Son,

06:13.965 --> 06:15.845
and the Holy Spirit.]

06:16.245 --> 06:19.325
[Come and save me. Amen.]

06:19.405 --> 06:22.605
[Glory to the Father, the Son

06:22.685 --> 06:24.445
and the Holy Spirit.]

06:24.525 --> 06:25.965
[Come and save me.]

06:26.045 --> 06:27.045
[Amen.]

06:58.765 --> 07:01.565
-[If it's all good, let's go.]
-[We're ready.]

07:01.645 --> 07:03.525
-[Move, open the door.]
-[Okay.]

07:04.405 --> 07:05.885
[Wait in the car.]

07:09.485 --> 07:12.445
-You must pray for your brother.
-We've been praying three months.

07:12.525 --> 07:14.405
He's still hooked to tubes
in the hospital.

07:14.485 --> 07:17.805
-I've got something more urgent to do.
-What can be so important?

07:22.165 --> 07:25.765
I'm the head of this family, Ma.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.565
Only you haven't realized that yet.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.285
It's time for you to step aside.

07:31.925 --> 07:34.045
That way,
you'll have more time for praying.

07:47.805 --> 07:49.925
Good evening. How are you?

07:50.685 --> 07:52.085
-How are you?
-Good evening.

07:53.325 --> 07:55.365
Wow, so many of you! What's going on?

07:57.165 --> 07:59.205
You got something to say to me?

07:59.605 --> 08:04.005
-When can we start pushing shit again?
-The situation's getting complicated.

08:04.085 --> 08:07.765
We've lost a ton of money
in the three months since you took over.

08:08.525 --> 08:10.525
And it can't be a problem just for us.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.645
Yes, it's a problem for everyone.
We're working on it.

08:14.725 --> 08:16.325
But you need to have some patience.

08:16.765 --> 08:17.885
All right?

08:18.845 --> 08:20.885
Have you ever had problems with my family?

08:22.765 --> 08:25.165
Have you had problems? Yes or no?

08:25.245 --> 08:26.685
-No.
-Right.

08:29.405 --> 08:31.845
I think we're done. Right?

08:35.565 --> 08:38.285
Word is Samurai's
blocking shipments to you.

08:38.804 --> 08:42.445
-Yeah, explain that whole business to us.
-Shut your mouth!

08:50.845 --> 08:53.365
And who told you? Huh?

08:53.765 --> 08:56.365
Aureliano, we just want to work.
How can we without coke?

08:56.445 --> 08:59.165
Remember, I decide when you work.

09:01.485 --> 09:02.525
All right?

09:04.685 --> 09:06.085
Now go fuck yourself.

09:10.925 --> 09:14.405
-You brushing us off like this?
-Next time I'll ask your permission.

09:15.605 --> 09:18.605
Gentlemen, we're done for today.
Thank you.

09:29.325 --> 09:31.485
Two goals conceded in ten minutes!

09:31.565 --> 09:35.125
I mean, it was only a friendly,
but losing a match that way is scandalous.

09:35.205 --> 09:38.885
Seriously! But let's get away from soccer.

09:38.965 --> 09:40.805
Let's try to think about something else.

09:40.885 --> 09:45.965
Tomorrow in Rome there's a vote
to elect a new mayor, a new city council

09:46.045 --> 09:49.845
and all new representatives
for the capital's 19 municipal districts.

09:49.925 --> 09:54.045
All people that we hope
will work diligently for our city,

09:54.125 --> 09:56.685
because in recent years
we've been through a lot.

09:57.045 --> 10:02.405
Among other things, all we needed
was the landing by boat this afternoon

10:02.525 --> 10:05.005
of more than 500 migrants.

10:06.085 --> 10:07.205
Utter madness.

10:07.845 --> 10:10.125
Rome is not equipped to take them in.

10:10.205 --> 10:12.285
I want to know
why didn't we stop them earlier?

10:12.365 --> 10:14.645
This is on the verge
of becoming unmanageable,

10:14.725 --> 10:17.285
for politicians, the Church, citizens.

10:17.365 --> 10:20.965
Who knows
if this news will also influence voters.

10:21.045 --> 10:22.645
I really hope so.

10:22.725 --> 10:26.405
Here at Radio Roma Sport we know very well
who we will be voting for.

10:26.485 --> 10:28.605
And we hope you do too.

10:28.685 --> 10:31.165
Go Roma! Go Roman people!

10:31.245 --> 10:36.085
We only have three hours to do the checks
before they open the polling station.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.325
Move it, guys. You already look tired!

10:48.205 --> 10:50.485
Magnani, did you bring your crosswords?

10:50.565 --> 10:53.125
-Even the monthly edition, Inspector.
-Good man. Go on.

10:53.765 --> 10:56.805
Massoli, stay by the stairs
so you can help the elderly.

10:56.885 --> 10:59.165
All right. Thank you, I can't wait.

11:00.645 --> 11:02.405
Something wrong?

11:02.485 --> 11:05.085
No, it's fine.
You're my boss and I do what you say.

11:08.005 --> 11:09.645
May I?

11:09.725 --> 11:11.085
Please.

11:56.485 --> 11:58.365
[in Sinti] [Got what I need?]

12:00.045 --> 12:01.925
[Do they know what you're doing at home?]

12:04.085 --> 12:05.605
[I've got something for you.]

12:19.125 --> 12:20.325
[To thank you.]

12:22.445 --> 12:23.485
[Show him in.]

13:02.165 --> 13:04.845
CANDIDATE FOR THE OFFICE OF MAYOR
AMEDEO CINAGLIA

13:32.125 --> 13:33.885
-Sir...
-My pleasure.

13:33.965 --> 13:35.645
-I'll leave this with you.
-Thank you.

13:35.725 --> 13:37.085
-Thank you. Bye.
-Goodbye.

13:37.165 --> 13:38.485
-Thanks. Have a nice day!
-Bye.

13:38.965 --> 13:40.165
Mr. Cinaglia!

13:40.245 --> 13:42.725
-Good day, everyone.
-Who'll be the new mayor of Rome?

13:42.805 --> 13:45.845
No comment.
Campaign silence is in effect. Good day.

13:46.485 --> 13:49.325
What took you so long?
Were you having second thoughts?

13:49.405 --> 13:52.165
It takes time
to find the least villainous one.

13:52.245 --> 13:53.565
Mr. Cinaglia?

13:54.485 --> 13:56.165
Adriano Latelli, Radio Roma Sport.

13:56.245 --> 13:57.605
-I know you.
-Hi.

13:57.965 --> 14:01.845
I followed your campaign very closely.
I'd like to ask you for an interview.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.925
Don't you cover sports?

14:04.005 --> 14:06.365
In truth, I cover everything
that happens in this city,

14:06.445 --> 14:08.965
from our beloved local team to politics,

14:09.045 --> 14:11.965
two topics that unite all our fans,
but you probably know that.

14:12.045 --> 14:14.125
-The polls are open. I can't talk.
-Sure.

14:14.205 --> 14:16.645
Not today.
Come on the show after the results are in.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.485
You'd do better to invite the winners.

14:19.565 --> 14:22.605
Mr. Cinaglia, you're going to be
the surprise of this election.

14:22.685 --> 14:24.405
Forget surprises.

14:26.645 --> 14:28.445
What a terrible answer!

14:28.525 --> 14:32.325
He discusses soccer.
He doesn't get a thing about politics.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.405
But a lot of people listen to him.

14:34.485 --> 14:37.165
Once again the sun shines on my city

14:37.245 --> 14:39.925
And gives me energy
To do even things I find shitty

14:40.005 --> 14:42.725
I got just enough time
To grab a coffee and run

14:42.805 --> 14:45.525
Just enough time to make sense of reality

14:45.605 --> 14:47.365
We used to dream of America here

14:47.445 --> 14:50.685
Now we just want to go to a place
Where people win who deserve it

14:50.765 --> 14:52.845
Look around
And you see people looking hysterical

14:52.925 --> 14:56.325
Talking shit
About conspiracies and mysteries

14:56.405 --> 14:58.485
Think about it
Those aren't the real troubles at all

14:58.565 --> 15:01.125
It's warmth we lack
We need love one and all

15:02.285 --> 15:04.845
-How many are there?
-Hundreds.

15:04.925 --> 15:06.605
We're ready.

15:06.685 --> 15:09.365
We need to know
what the authorities want to do.

15:09.445 --> 15:13.205
Yes, but this is a state of emergency.
They can't refuse to give them to us.

15:13.285 --> 15:17.325
-We must be patient, Sara.
-We've waited long enough.

15:17.405 --> 15:18.645
Your Eminence,

15:18.725 --> 15:22.565
the facilities you've provided my charity
are ready to start running.

15:22.645 --> 15:25.725
If we squeeze them in,
we can shelter hundreds.

15:25.805 --> 15:28.645
At 35 euros a day for each one of them.

15:29.285 --> 15:31.925
A tidy sum, wouldn't you say?

15:34.205 --> 15:36.365
Sir, excuse me. May I?

15:36.845 --> 15:41.285
Can you tell me the exact number of people
we need to provide shelter for?

15:42.645 --> 15:44.365
514, Your Eminence.

15:44.445 --> 15:48.565
We can provide shelter for all of them.
We can try to not to split up families.

15:48.645 --> 15:51.725
Mrs. Monaschi's organization is quite new.

15:51.805 --> 15:54.885
This task requires people with experience
to keep things going.

15:55.565 --> 15:59.485
You could send your staff to give
Mrs. Monaschi's organization a hand.

16:01.045 --> 16:03.765
-And who gets the money?
-Sister!

16:03.845 --> 16:06.765
You're worrying about money
in a situation like this?

16:07.885 --> 16:10.965
All right, you take the families, ma'am.
Come with me.

16:20.765 --> 16:22.285
Where were you?

16:22.365 --> 16:25.325
-I have to talk to you.
-I have to talk to you, too.

16:25.405 --> 16:27.565
-I've got Livia Adami.
-What?

16:27.645 --> 16:28.645
Yes.

16:28.725 --> 16:31.325
I put guys everywhere.
Bus and train stations, airports.

16:31.405 --> 16:33.645
We finally got her.

16:33.725 --> 16:35.605
She fled Rome.

16:36.405 --> 16:39.925
Without her,
Samurai's Ostia deal falls through.

16:40.005 --> 16:42.205
-Now I've got her.
-Play that card right, Spadino.

16:42.725 --> 16:44.245
Yes, I know.

16:44.325 --> 16:45.765
I already know how.

16:45.845 --> 16:49.565
I want to show them all in there
they've got a real boss.

16:54.485 --> 16:55.965
I'm ready.

16:57.405 --> 17:00.205
-I'm ready, too.
-Good.

17:02.245 --> 17:03.405
For what?

17:10.885 --> 17:12.645
There are two lines, right?

17:15.405 --> 17:16.645
Yes, what does it mean?

17:35.285 --> 17:39.005
-What do you say in these situations?
-You say, "Get outta here."

17:47.325 --> 17:49.205
She's not here, let's keep looking.

17:52.165 --> 17:55.165
I can't come.
There's a new problem in Ostia.

17:55.245 --> 17:57.285
-What problem?
-At the bar.

17:57.365 --> 17:59.245
They took everything we had left.

18:03.525 --> 18:05.405
Go on ahead, I'll join you later.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.085
Massoli?

18:10.125 --> 18:13.365
Listen, in a while I have to go.
You take charge of the polling station.

18:13.445 --> 18:15.685
-As you wish, Sir.
-So formal again. Quit it.

18:15.765 --> 18:18.485
Inspector, there's no point
in you being sweet with me.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.445
Cristiana, I only want to work
in a peaceful environment.

18:21.525 --> 18:22.925
Especially with you, you're...

18:25.365 --> 18:27.125
my best officer.

18:27.205 --> 18:29.725
-Is that clear?
-All right, and thank you.

18:29.805 --> 18:31.405
Sorry, I gotta go.

19:01.925 --> 19:05.565
-What do you want?
-I came to pay my compliments in person.

19:06.845 --> 19:09.685
Deputy Inspector
of the Ostia Police Force.

19:11.205 --> 19:13.245
Well, what a coincidence!

19:13.325 --> 19:17.685
-Right where I need someone I can trust.
-I don't work for you anymore.

19:18.605 --> 19:20.805
-You think so?
-Yes, I do.

19:27.725 --> 19:30.485
Julius Caesar forgave traitors,
do you know why?

19:31.525 --> 19:33.925
Because he thought
even an enemy could come in handy,

19:34.005 --> 19:35.685
if he can be blackmailed.

19:37.285 --> 19:40.125
You tried to fuck me over
and I forgave you.

19:40.205 --> 19:43.125
I know an awful lot about you, Lele.

19:43.205 --> 19:45.765
You've got no proof.
You ain't got a damn thing.

19:45.845 --> 19:48.205
If you talk, I'll denounce you,
even if I risk jail myself.

19:48.725 --> 19:50.965
Think you're an inspector
because you're so smart?

19:52.205 --> 19:55.925
Who do you think got you the job?
Your dearly departed father?

19:58.205 --> 19:59.925
That's right, don't answer me.

20:02.005 --> 20:05.365
Livia Adami is back in Rome.
Find her and bring her to me now.

20:06.405 --> 20:08.005
Get to it.

20:08.085 --> 20:11.445
Now you've got police resources
at your disposal, use them well.

20:12.405 --> 20:14.525
She was last seen in this motel.

20:16.005 --> 20:17.365
I'll call you.

20:19.045 --> 20:21.165
Just think
if your father could see you now.

20:22.165 --> 20:24.165
How proud he'd be.

21:15.525 --> 21:19.125
-They took everything, the pieces of shit.
-Who could it have been?

21:21.325 --> 21:22.685
Come with me.

21:23.605 --> 21:25.565
Guys, everyone come here please.

21:25.645 --> 21:28.045
Switch everything off.
Chiara, wrap it up. Stop.

21:28.645 --> 21:31.605
This electoral campaign
has been a long adventure.

21:31.685 --> 21:33.965
We've met a lot of people in recent weeks.

21:34.045 --> 21:36.045
We've heard their problems and complaints.

21:36.125 --> 21:39.285
We've presented
our projects and our ideas to them.

21:39.365 --> 21:42.885
I sincerely want to thank all of you,
one by one.

21:42.965 --> 21:45.925
I consider your faith in me
to be part of the commitment I've made.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.805
Really. Great job.
Great job everyone, thank you.

21:49.565 --> 21:53.605
Running as an independent candidate
in Rome was a crazy thing to do.

21:53.685 --> 21:56.685
I will never be the Mayor of Rome.
We always knew that.

21:56.765 --> 22:00.925
We want 3%, which may not seem like much,
but it's a lot for us.

22:01.005 --> 22:05.645
3% gets us onto the city council,
and then we can start to change things.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.645
So, really, thanks again, people.
Thank you all. Thank you.

22:13.565 --> 22:14.925
Well done.

22:15.005 --> 22:16.085
Thanks.

22:19.565 --> 22:22.085
-Did I sound like I was at a rally?
-Stop! You like it.

22:22.165 --> 22:24.165
- Did you see the polls?
- Yeah.

22:24.245 --> 22:26.685
-I'm at 2.5%.
-Polls can be wrong.

22:26.765 --> 22:28.485
-You know that.
-Let's hope.

22:28.845 --> 22:30.965
-I gambled everything.
-Amedeo.

22:31.685 --> 22:33.165
Look at me.

22:33.765 --> 22:36.245
It'll be fine. I'm certain of it.

22:41.805 --> 22:42.885
Fabrizio...

23:34.125 --> 23:35.685
It's Moroccan, you'll love it.

23:35.765 --> 23:37.325
No, I can't smoke today.

23:38.445 --> 23:39.605
I've got to keep a clear head.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.525
What's going on
for you to say no to a joint?

23:42.005 --> 23:43.325
Angelica's pregnant.

23:46.565 --> 23:48.205
Unbelievable, right?

23:53.485 --> 23:55.365
Everything's about to change.

24:00.885 --> 24:02.885
Can you see yourself changing diapers?

24:03.645 --> 24:05.365
Fuck that! Angelica will do it.

24:05.445 --> 24:09.045
Sorry, I forgot your family still lives
in the Middle Ages.

24:14.525 --> 24:16.445
Nice track.

24:16.525 --> 24:17.805
Is it yours?

24:18.485 --> 24:19.925
Yeah, it is nice.

24:20.685 --> 24:22.885
You're talking about Rome's best DJs.

24:28.325 --> 24:29.765
We're playing tonight.

24:31.125 --> 24:32.205
Can you come?

24:33.725 --> 24:35.205
No, I can't tonight, Teo.

24:38.045 --> 24:39.925
I'm about to make it big.

24:42.525 --> 24:44.125
I'm about to make it big.

25:20.445 --> 25:22.085
[in Sinti] [I'd like you to meet...

25:23.205 --> 25:24.725
Livia Adami.]

25:32.525 --> 25:36.405
I knew you were trash,
but not to this degree...

25:36.485 --> 25:37.765
Show some respect.

25:39.765 --> 25:41.485
[in Sinti] [All Rome's looking for her.]

25:43.805 --> 25:45.245
[And I got her.]

25:47.845 --> 25:49.405
[This changes everything.]

25:49.485 --> 25:52.365
[We can get into business in Rome,
the big stuff.]

25:52.445 --> 25:54.165
[Nice, Spadino!]

25:58.245 --> 26:00.085
[She's our bargaining chip.]

26:00.445 --> 26:02.405
[I'll give her
to the King of Rome, Samurai.]

26:06.685 --> 26:08.325
[We'll make a deal with him.]

26:09.445 --> 26:12.565
[It'll be the deal of the century.
The Port of Ostia.]

26:12.645 --> 26:15.285
[The Anacletis are moving up.]

26:16.405 --> 26:17.565
[Trust me.]

26:23.685 --> 26:25.165
Your mother wants to talk to you.

26:25.765 --> 26:28.125
Here two months
and you think you can give orders?

26:28.805 --> 26:30.565
Adelaide wanted me here.

26:31.165 --> 26:33.645
She's clearly uneasy without Manfredi.

26:35.445 --> 26:38.565
Look, ten years of dealing in Abruzzo
doesn't count for shit.

26:39.245 --> 26:41.085
Here you're just hired help.

26:52.605 --> 26:55.485
That goes over here.
Set it up here please.

26:55.565 --> 26:57.565
Sister, make these two as soon as you can.

26:57.645 --> 26:59.005
Very well.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.565
-Michela?
-Yes.

27:00.645 --> 27:03.285
-Pardon me, can I see the arrivals list?
-Here.

27:06.285 --> 27:08.685
512 immigrants. Good.

27:10.205 --> 27:12.485
Except for a last few preparations,
we're ready.

27:12.565 --> 27:14.925
I've had them prepare extra beds,
as we discussed.

27:15.005 --> 27:16.765
Good, Sara. Great job.

27:17.445 --> 27:19.245
-By the way...
-Cardinal Pascagni?

27:20.485 --> 27:22.085
Vatican Gendarmerie.

27:22.165 --> 27:24.445
Sorry to disturb you.
You have to come with us.

27:44.685 --> 27:45.605
Hello.

27:47.725 --> 27:48.805
Have you seen her?

27:50.445 --> 27:52.525
She was here, right?

27:52.605 --> 27:54.965
Yes, but she left and didn't come back.

27:55.285 --> 27:56.925
I know nothing about her.

27:57.725 --> 28:01.605
-Let me see the camera footage, please.
-I can't. There are privacy laws.

28:01.685 --> 28:03.245
Privacy...

28:05.805 --> 28:06.885
Is this enough?

28:39.925 --> 28:41.085
Here I am.

28:42.485 --> 28:44.165
Well done, Alberto.

28:44.245 --> 28:46.805
I didn't expect a move like that from you.

28:51.245 --> 28:53.925
I've already told your cousin Alex
to take care of it.

28:55.405 --> 28:56.725
Of what?

28:56.805 --> 28:57.805
Livia Adami.

28:58.205 --> 29:00.245
I'll take her to Samurai myself tomorrow.

29:00.645 --> 29:02.165
You don't get it, Ma.

29:03.245 --> 29:04.845
I'll take her and I'll negotiate.

29:05.645 --> 29:06.685
No, Alberto.

29:07.845 --> 29:11.165
The head of this family negotiates,
and that's not you.

29:11.645 --> 29:13.405
And you never will be.

29:14.165 --> 29:17.365
I'm in charge until your brother wakes up.

29:17.445 --> 29:20.085
Then, God willing,
he'll take charge again.

29:21.685 --> 29:23.565
What the fuck are you saying, Ma?

29:25.365 --> 29:28.205
Manfredi's in that state because of you.

29:29.445 --> 29:31.525
And in this family we pay for our sins.

29:32.205 --> 29:35.765
You have no future as long as I'm alive.

29:49.245 --> 29:51.325
CHILDREN'S PARADISE

30:26.285 --> 30:28.445
-Where's your father?
-I don't know.

30:29.405 --> 30:31.525
I haven't got time to waste. Where is he?

30:33.525 --> 30:36.925
-Hey! What's going on?
-You tell me what's going on. Come here.

30:38.685 --> 30:41.245
-Nothing to tell me?
-I really don't think so.

30:43.605 --> 30:45.685
Take her away. Turn the rides on.

30:54.485 --> 30:58.725
-Give me my shit.
-Why not go worry about your sister again?

30:58.805 --> 31:00.965
That way the drugs will move again...

31:07.125 --> 31:08.365
Give me my shit.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.485
If I tell you where it is, what do I get?

31:17.645 --> 31:21.285
I have to say my father was right.
He said you were a moron.

31:22.845 --> 31:24.525
You can't negotiate with me.

31:26.165 --> 31:28.085
If you want your shit, make a deal.

31:49.165 --> 31:52.245
-Where's my stuff?
-We don't know, I swear.

31:52.325 --> 31:53.485
We really don't know.

32:02.245 --> 32:05.605
Now you're going to find it
and you're going to bring it to me, today.

32:05.685 --> 32:08.565
Or this damn play-park
will become a graveyard.

32:37.965 --> 32:40.405
The moment of truth has come, Cinaglia.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.845
We've worked hard the past few months.

32:44.565 --> 32:48.605
-Do you think you did a good job?
-We ran a campaign with a clear agenda.

32:49.365 --> 32:52.285
However, in politics you can never
take anything for granted.

32:54.965 --> 32:57.725
Tonight we'll find out
if I backed the right horse.

33:05.245 --> 33:06.725
Speaking of which...

33:09.045 --> 33:10.565
Nice leaflet.

33:25.085 --> 33:26.685
You look tired.

33:32.765 --> 33:35.005
What happens if I'm not elected?

33:35.885 --> 33:37.925
I'll give it to you straight.

33:38.005 --> 33:40.725
A lifetime won't be enough
to pay me back for the damage caused.

33:42.605 --> 33:46.085
And I'm not talking about the money
I spent for your fucking flyers.

33:46.165 --> 33:49.485
I'm talking about the damage
of having invested in the wrong person.

33:52.245 --> 33:55.365
In this game you can't afford
to lose a single hand, Cinaglia.

33:58.885 --> 34:01.005
It's not easy to find someone like me.

34:02.965 --> 34:06.005
We're in the same boat, don't forget that.

34:18.125 --> 34:19.204
This way, please.

34:32.525 --> 34:34.005
You have five minutes.

34:35.204 --> 34:36.204
Thank you.

34:39.405 --> 34:41.405
Your Eminence, what's going on?

34:41.485 --> 34:44.325
They're investigating my past.

34:44.405 --> 34:46.845
Soon I'll be brought to trial.

34:51.285 --> 34:53.005
And our deal?

34:53.085 --> 34:54.164
Over.

34:54.765 --> 34:56.644
But I need you.

34:57.525 --> 34:59.885
The refugee center
is in one of your facilities.

34:59.965 --> 35:02.165
Hundreds of thousands of euros
are about to come in.

35:02.245 --> 35:04.125
I can't help you anymore.

35:06.485 --> 35:07.965
What am I supposed to do?

35:09.485 --> 35:11.565
You'll have to find someone else.

35:18.485 --> 35:23.285
There's a kid outside who says there's
a cop you know who wants to talk to you.

35:35.925 --> 35:36.925
[in Sinti] [Well?]

35:38.045 --> 35:39.565
[Where is he?]

35:39.645 --> 35:41.725
[He's waiting for you there.]

36:00.245 --> 36:01.965
Just let me talk, Spadino.

36:03.565 --> 36:04.885
What the fuck do you want?

36:05.805 --> 36:07.125
I want to explain.

36:08.565 --> 36:10.605
I set you guys up. I'm sorry.

36:12.565 --> 36:16.565
-Samurai would've killed me if I hadn't.
-You're a piece of shit.

36:17.205 --> 36:18.605
What I did was stupid.

36:20.085 --> 36:22.525
But I paid dearly.
I lost my father, for fuck's sake.

36:22.685 --> 36:24.325
That's your fault, not ours.

36:25.045 --> 36:26.045
I know.

36:26.765 --> 36:29.045
I joined the police to change my life,

36:29.405 --> 36:32.565
but that piece of shit Samuari
is back on my ass.

36:32.645 --> 36:34.605
He's blackmailing me.

36:34.685 --> 36:37.525
Now that you're a cop, I care even less.

36:37.605 --> 36:39.885
-He's looking for Livia.
-All Rome is looking for her.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.365
I know you've got her.

36:42.765 --> 36:46.485
And what are you going to do?
Rat me out as usual? Huh?

36:47.765 --> 36:49.125
No.

36:49.765 --> 36:52.205
I wanted to warn you.

37:05.685 --> 37:07.605
Now you have to do something for me.

37:11.765 --> 37:15.245
Something big must have happened
for you to come all the way here.

37:16.685 --> 37:18.645
-Care to step inside?
-No.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.525
I've got Livia Adami.

37:22.885 --> 37:24.205
You're interested, right?

37:25.565 --> 37:26.805
You can have her.

37:27.605 --> 37:30.485
You just have to hand over
all the dealing in Ostia to me.

37:31.045 --> 37:32.565
Just the Anacletis, is that clear?

37:34.005 --> 37:35.845
-Is she in the car?
-No.

37:35.925 --> 37:39.445
First we make the deal,
then we pay the price.

37:46.005 --> 37:48.645
Bring her here in an hour
and we'll make a deal.

37:51.405 --> 37:53.445
So are you in charge now?

37:55.845 --> 37:58.725
-You not all right with that?
-Sure, it suits me fine.

37:59.125 --> 38:00.925
Women are more reasonable.

38:10.645 --> 38:13.565
We should spread them out.
What do you think, Amedeo?

38:13.645 --> 38:16.725
-All right.
-I think we need more beverages.

38:16.805 --> 38:18.325
-Chiara?
-Yes?

38:18.405 --> 38:21.325
-Could you get drinks from the bar?
-Sure. I'll run over.

38:21.405 --> 38:23.565
-I'll grab my bag.
-Wait, I'll go.

38:23.645 --> 38:26.285
Where are you going?
You'll miss the results.

38:26.365 --> 38:27.365
I need some air.

38:33.285 --> 38:35.885
CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS
AMEDEO CINAGLIA

39:01.805 --> 39:04.605
Whoa! Stop! Stop! Where are you going?

39:08.845 --> 39:11.445
-[in Sinti] [What's going on?]
-[Damn dogs.]

39:12.525 --> 39:15.845
-[Move! Open the door!]
-[Spadino, what the fuck are you doing?]

39:23.285 --> 39:27.005
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Shut up and come with me. Come on!

39:31.045 --> 39:32.485
Move! Come on!

39:33.405 --> 39:35.085
[What the fuck are you doing, Spadino?]

39:36.885 --> 39:38.325
[Come with me.]

39:46.965 --> 39:49.725
Go back inside and don't let them see you.

39:51.685 --> 39:52.685
Go on!

40:03.725 --> 40:05.285
Come on, let's go.

40:10.565 --> 40:16.125
At last the municipal election exit polls
in the capital have come in.

40:16.205 --> 40:19.245
Excuse me? Can you turn up the volume?

40:19.325 --> 40:24.805
Centre-Left candidate Danilo Scorsetto
is in first place.

40:24.885 --> 40:28.645
-Thank you.
- However, he is far from exceeding 50%.

40:28.725 --> 40:30.485
The heavily favored Left,

40:30.565 --> 40:34.045
who were confident their mayoral candidate
would be elected in the first round,

40:34.125 --> 40:37.165
have attained 45.2% of the vote.

40:37.245 --> 40:41.565
In second place in the polls,
and thus in the run-off, Da Campi,

40:41.645 --> 40:47.165
supported by the Center-Right coalition,
he received 40.6%.

40:47.245 --> 40:50.765
But, in third place,
the true surprise of these elections,

40:50.845 --> 40:55.005
Amedeo Cinaglia
and his independent party United for Rome,

40:55.085 --> 40:57.245
which has won over 9%.

40:57.325 --> 41:01.125
Cinaglia has not only assured
his return to city hall,

41:01.205 --> 41:02.965
he has also asserted himself

41:03.045 --> 41:05.805
as a new independent political force
in Rome.

41:05.885 --> 41:10.725
There will have to be a second round
of voting to elect the new mayor of Rome

41:10.805 --> 41:14.765
in which those who voted for Cinaglia
will hold the decisive votes.

41:15.085 --> 41:18.845
For all intents and purposes,
Cinaglia will be the one to tip the scales

41:18.925 --> 41:21.085
in the election
of the capital's new mayor.

41:21.885 --> 41:25.125
That's it for us for today,
but we'll be back again tomorrow.

41:25.205 --> 41:27.645
Goodnight. And, as always, go Roma!

41:38.605 --> 41:39.845
Let's go.

41:45.325 --> 41:47.445
-What is it?
-You've got visitors.

42:07.485 --> 42:08.805
Let me talk.

42:13.125 --> 42:14.525
I come in peace.

42:19.565 --> 42:21.405
I've brought you a present.

42:23.725 --> 42:25.605
To show you can still trust me.

42:53.645 --> 42:55.245
All Rome wants her, Aureliano.

42:56.685 --> 42:58.525
And we brought her to you.

43:00.605 --> 43:03.845
You can have her,
and all the land in Ostia.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.845
Kill her, do whatever you want with her.

43:11.085 --> 43:13.965
But afterwards,
we have to get back together again.

43:17.685 --> 43:19.525
The three of us against everybody.

43:20.725 --> 43:22.205
Against Samurai...

43:25.085 --> 43:27.045
To finally run this city.

43:38.565 --> 43:40.005
Thanks.

43:48.805 --> 43:50.605
Now get the fuck out of here!

43:53.525 --> 43:54.645
Go.

44:48.165 --> 44:50.605
