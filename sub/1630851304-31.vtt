00:35.335 --> 00:37.570

A DEAL WITH THE GUYS.

00:51.284 --> 00:54.621
>> ONE THING I'M NOT REALLY
TRYING TO TO DO HAVE EITHER ONE

00:54.621 --> 00:55.855
OF YOUR NAMES IN MY MOUTH.

00:55.855 --> 00:57.357

00:57.357 --> 00:59.859

TIFFANY HAD A BULLS EYE ON HER

01:58.451 --> 01:59.719
BACK.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.955
>> THIS IS GREAT, I HAVE BEEN
WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT FOR SUCH

02:01.955 --> 02:02.856
A LONG TIME.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.391
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HER OUT OF
THIS HOUSE.

02:05.391 --> 02:08.561
>> Announcer: IT WAS A
MUST-WIN VET OR FOR HANNA AND

02:08.561 --> 02:09.362
TIFF.

02:09.362 --> 02:10.730
>> I KNOW I'M THE TARGET THIS
WEEK.

02:10.730 --> 02:14.467
HAVE I TO WIN THIS GOLDEN POWER
OF VETO AND SAVE MYSELF.

02:14.467 --> 02:23.209
>> Announcer: BUT THE
KYLANDER CAPTURED IT INSTEAD.

02:23.209 --> 02:24.377
>> BOOM, LOOK AT THIS.

02:24.377 --> 02:27.447
LACKS LIKE I'M KEEPING ALL POT

THIS ONE FEELS NICE.

02:29.015 --> 02:31.017
>> Announcer: AT THE VETO
MEETING.

02:31.017 --> 02:34.454
>> I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO.

02:34.454 --> 02:37.957
>> Announcer: KYLAND SEALED
EITHER HANNAH OR TIFFANY'S FATE.

02:37.957 --> 02:42.295
AND THERE WILL BE MORE THAN ONE
COOKOUT MEMBER HEADED TO JURY.

02:42.295 --> 02:46.132
BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER DOUBLE
EVICTION, BABY.

02:46.132 --> 02:49.669
THE HOUSEGUESTS WILL BE SHOCKED
WHEN THEY LEARN THEY MUST ONCE

02:49.669 --> 02:53.373
AGAIN DO A WEEK'S WORTH OF GAME
PLAY IN ONE NIGHT.

02:53.373 --> 03:00.513
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW ON A SPECIAL
TWO-HOUR BIG BROTHER.

03:00.513 --> 03:10.123
>> THE COOKOUT SLASM-- !

03:10.123 --> 03:15.395
>> Julie: GOOD EVENING, I'M
JULIE CHEN MOONVES, WELCOME TO

03:15.395 --> 03:18.731
ANOTHER DOUBLE EVICTION NIGHT ON
BIG BROTHER.

03:18.731 --> 03:23.870
FOR THE ENTIRE SUMMER THE
SIX-MEMBER COOKOUT

03:23.870 --> 03:25.338
APPLIANCE-- ALLIANCE PLAYED THIS
GAME UNITED IN THEIR GOAL TO

03:25.338 --> 03:31.544
MAKE HISTORY BY GUARANTEEING
THAT THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN

03:31.544 --> 03:33.212
HOUSEGUESTS WILL WIN BIG
BROTHER.

03:33.212 --> 03:36.516
BUT NOW THAT THEY'VE ACHIEVED
THEIR GOAL, TONIGHT THE COOKOUT

03:36.516 --> 03:41.688
ENDS AND IT'S EVERY MAN AND
WOMAN FOR HIM OR HERSELF.

03:41.688 --> 03:46.092
SO WILL TIFFANY OR HANNAH BE THE
FIRST MEMBER OF THE COOKOUT TO

03:46.092 --> 03:47.293
BE EVICTED?

03:47.293 --> 03:50.863
AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE
SURPRISE THEM WITH THE NEWS THAT

03:50.863 --> 03:54.934
TONIGHT IS ACTUALLY DOUBLE
EVICTION NIGHT.

03:54.934 --> 03:58.438
WE'LL AL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

03:58.438 --> 04:03.076
BUT FIRST THEY DID IT, THE
COOKOUT ACHIEVED THEIR HISTORIC

04:03.076 --> 04:03.676
GOAL.

04:03.676 --> 04:08.247
NOW THE HARD PART BEGINS.

04:08.247 --> 04:16.189
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

04:16.189 --> 04:19.659
I DECIDED NOT TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO BECAUSE TIFFANY HAD NOT

04:19.659 --> 04:22.595
ONLY BROKEN TRUST WITH ME, BUT
WITH THE REST OF THE HOUSE.

04:22.595 --> 04:27.266
SO IF I HAD AN ACTIVE GOAL IN
HELPING HER TO STAY, I WOULD

04:27.266 --> 04:31.471
ALSO MAKE MYSELF A TARGET.

04:31.471 --> 04:35.041
>> I UNDERSTAND HY KYLAND CHOSE
TO KEEP THE NOMINATIONS THE SAME

04:35.041 --> 04:38.011
BUT IT IS HARD BECAUSE THAT MEAN
THERE IS NO CHANCE OF TIFFANY

04:38.011 --> 04:40.079
AND I MOVING FORWARD IN THIS
GAME TOGETHER.

04:40.079 --> 04:42.148
I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO BE
UPSET.

04:42.148 --> 04:45.652
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW I AM
GOING TO MAKE DEALS AND NAVIGATE

04:45.652 --> 04:52.091
THE REST OF THIS GAME WITHOUT MY
NUMBER ONE ALLY HERE.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.627
>> I WHAT IS THIS, FAMILY.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.963
>> MAYBE.

04:56.963 --> 04:57.630
STAY THIS WEEK.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.599
I JUST HAVE SOME WORK TO DO.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.467
I NEED TO WORK ON BIG D.

05:01.467 --> 05:05.038
I ALSO NEED TO WORK ON X-ZAVIER,
HAVE I GOT A LOT OF TRICKS IN MY

05:05.038 --> 05:08.041
BAG AND I PLAN TO PULL THEM OUT.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.409
>> WHY Y'ALL HUGGING HIM.

05:09.409 --> 05:10.943
HE IS SAFE.

05:10.943 --> 05:19.919
WE'RE THE ONES ON THE BLOCK.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.555
>> I AM EXCITED TO WATCH, DO YOU
WANT TO WATCH IT?

05:22.555 --> 05:23.523
>> THIS SEASON.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.323
>> YEAH.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.559
>> I DO, I DO BUT I DON'T BUT I
DO.

05:26.559 --> 05:32.298
I THINK IT WILL ALSO BE KIND OF
FUNNY TO SEE HOW IN CONTROL WILL

05:32.298 --> 05:32.832
PEOPLE.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.100
>> THOUGHT THEY WERE.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.837
>> YEAH, AND US BEING LIKE WELL,
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE INTENDED

05:37.837 --> 05:39.472
TO HAPPEN.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.540
>> YEAH.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.742
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO.

05:42.742 --> 05:45.411
>> I KNOW YOU HAVE, YOU WANTED
TO TAKE ME WITH YOU TO THIS

05:45.411 --> 05:46.412
GAME.

05:46.412 --> 05:51.884
>> BUT WE COULDN'T BECAUSE THERE
WAS SO MANY-- .

05:51.884 --> 05:57.824
>> A LOT OF THINGS I WANTED TO
DO.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.359
AND A LOT OF MANIPULATING, BUT
IT IS THE GAME.

06:00.359 --> 06:05.465
BUT THIS WAS FUN, IT WAS FUN TO
GET US HERE.

06:05.465 --> 06:06.365
>> YEAH.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.633
>> WE DEFINITELY HAVE
ACCOMPLISHED A LOT.

06:07.633 --> 06:13.206
GETTING THE SIX OF US HERE,
MOVING AS COVERTLY AS WE DID, IS

06:13.206 --> 06:14.674
THE GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT.

06:14.674 --> 06:19.078
AND WHAT WE DID WAS GUARANTEE
THAT THERE WILL BE TWO

06:19.078 --> 06:21.981
AFRICAN-AMERICANS SITTING IN
THOSE FINAL TWO SEATS, ONE OF

06:21.981 --> 06:27.487
THEM WILL BE CROWNED THE FIRST
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WINNER OF BIG

06:27.487 --> 06:28.054
BROTHER.

06:28.054 --> 06:32.525
>> I'M THE EASY TARGET.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.626
>> UH-HUH.

06:33.626 --> 06:38.197
>> I PERSONALLY THINK IT IS
UNFAIR THAT TIFFANY COULD

06:38.197 --> 06:41.100
POSSIBLY BE THE FIRST MEMBER OF
THE COOKOUT TO LEAVE.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.870
WITHOUT TIFFANY AND HER MASTER
PLAN, I'M NOT SURE IF WE COULD

06:43.870 --> 06:45.104
HAVE MADE IT THIS FAR.

06:45.104 --> 06:49.242
IF I AM ABLE TO STAY PAST THIS
WEEK, THAN I WILL BE FIGHTING

06:49.242 --> 06:50.843
FOR TIFFANY AND MYSELF.

06:50.843 --> 06:54.647
IN THE END, WE ALL SACRIFICED A
LOT TO MAKE IT TO THIS POINT.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.750
AND NOT ONLY DID WE GET LIKE
THREE BLACK PEOPLE TO THE FINAL

06:57.750 --> 07:03.189
THREE, WE GOT SIX TO FINAL SIX.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.323
>> WHOOO.

07:04.323 --> 07:07.493
IT WILL FOREVER BE CEMENTED IN
BIG BROTHER HISTORY AS THE

07:07.493 --> 07:07.794
COOKOUT.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.028
>> YES.

07:09.028 --> 07:11.264
>> THAT IS PRETTY AMAZING, SO
EVEN IF I LEAVE THIS WEEK, NEXT

07:11.264 --> 07:22.375
WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER, I'M
REALLY PROUD OF US.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.109
>> WHERE IS AZAH.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.610
>> RIGHT HERE, HOW ARE YOU
DOING?

07:24.610 --> 07:28.514
SWNS I'M OKAY.

07:28.514 --> 07:32.218
I THINK I CAN STAY.

07:32.218 --> 07:42.261
I WON'T HAVE I ONLY HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT DEREK.

07:42.261 --> 07:48.534
I WON'T HAVE I ONLY HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT DEREK.

07:48.534 --> 07:59.946
>> DEREK-- HE DON'T KNOW
WHICH-- TRY TO PLAY THIS GAME

07:59.946 --> 08:02.615
WITH NO EMOTION.

08:02.615 --> 08:08.921
HE IS THE ONLY PERSON I
THINK-- I'M DEFINITELY CHOOSING

08:08.921 --> 08:14.460
SOMEBODY OVER LOVE OR CARE OR
FRIENDSHIP.

08:14.460 --> 08:19.999
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY HE WOULD
THINK THAT SHE WOULD BE-- I'M

08:19.999 --> 08:22.668
NOT COMING AFTER YOU.

08:22.668 --> 08:29.942
I DON'T WANT TO TALK BSH-- .

08:29.942 --> 08:39.986
>> LOOK HERE.

08:39.986 --> 09:03.843
>> LOOK HERE.

09:07.513 --> 09:10.983
>> GUYS TRIP T IS ME AND YOU, WE
HAVE TO PICK THREE OTHER TO COME

09:10.983 --> 09:12.585
WITH, CHRISTIAN I GOT TO PICK.

09:12.585 --> 09:17.823
BABY D.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.025
>> HONESTLY.

09:19.025 --> 09:25.631
>> WHO IS THE FIFTH PICK BETWEEN
FRENCHIE, BRENT AND TRAVIS.

09:25.631 --> 09:26.799
>> SAFETY BOY.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.735
>> NOW HERE IS THE THING, IT
DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF VIBE.

09:29.735 --> 09:30.937
>> YEAH, WE'RE'S GOING.

09:30.937 --> 09:34.774
>> IF WE'RE GOING TO VEGAS,
BRENT WOULD BE A HELL OF A GOOD

09:34.774 --> 09:35.274
TIME.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.509
>> HE MIGHT NOT BE.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.744
>> WHY WOULD YOU NOT TAKE ME TO
VEGAS.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.513
I'M THE BEST TIME YOU CAN EVER
HAVE.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.115
>> YES, HE WOULD BE A GREAT TIME
AND THE BEST.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.985
>> AND BRENT SAYS HE DOESN'T GO
OUT A LOT.

09:45.985 --> 09:49.221
>> YOUR VERSION IS MUCH MORE
SIMILAR THAN MY VERSION.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.657
>> KY, ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT
NOW?

09:51.657 --> 09:55.494
HAVE Y'ALL LOST YOUR-- MIND?

09:55.494 --> 09:58.531
LAST TIME I CHECKED I KNOW I'M
THE BEST WING MAN YOU CAN GET,

09:58.531 --> 10:02.868
ME, NOT ON A TRIP WITH THEM
WOULD BE BORE-RING.

10:02.868 --> 10:07.406
THEY NEED ME THERE AND THEY KNOW
THAT.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.208
>> I'M THE BEST PERSON YOU COULD
EVER TAKE ON A TRIP.

10:09.208 --> 10:13.779
WE COULD BE IN A ROOM FULL OF
WHITE WALLS AND Y'ALL BITCHES BE

10:13.779 --> 10:18.084
ENTERTAINED BY MY BLACK-- WHAT
Y'ALL TALKING ABOUT.

10:18.084 --> 10:21.587
OBVIOUSLY IF THERE WAS EVER A
TRIP INVOLVING BB23, HE WOULD BE

10:21.587 --> 10:25.691
INVITED BUT IT IS FUN TO POKE AT
HIS EGO A LITTLE BIT AND HE

10:25.691 --> 10:30.096
TAKES IT SO SERIOUSLY.

10:30.096 --> 10:30.830
>> PRESENT!

10:30.830 --> 10:31.664
-- BRENT!

10:31.664 --> 10:41.707
YOU BETTER OFF TAKING A LOAF OF
BREAD.

10:41.707 --> 10:50.082
YOU BETTER OFF TAKING A LOAF OF
BREAD.

10:50.082 --> 10:56.489
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING?

10:56.489 --> 11:00.326
>> CAN'T EVEN HAVE A
CONVERSATION, THE CHALLENGES OF

11:00.326 --> 11:05.364
THE GAME, THE GAME AS A WHOLE.

11:05.364 --> 11:14.106
I THINK IT SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKES
IT EASIER AND HARDER.

11:14.106 --> 11:24.150
SO I'M CONSTANTLY HAVING-- I
GREW UP, VERY CLOSE TO-- AND SO

11:24.150 --> 11:29.388
SO I'M CONSTANTLY HAVING-- I
GREW UP, VERY CLOSE TO-- AND SO

11:29.388 --> 11:38.097
I HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT I
FEEL CONCRETE, JUST THINKING A

11:38.097 --> 11:39.131
LOT.

11:39.131 --> 11:41.333
>> DOES THAT MAKE SENSE, DO YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

11:41.333 --> 11:45.905
>> I AIN'T GOING TO LIE, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT KYLAND IS

11:45.905 --> 11:49.475
TALKING ABOUT ALL THE TIME, WHAT
YOU ALWAYS DO IS NOT SMILE.

11:49.475 --> 11:56.715
I DON'T THINK I WILL BE ASKING
KYLAND HOW ARE YOU FOR QUITE

11:56.715 --> 11:58.084
SOME TIME.

11:58.084 --> 11:58.651
>> SORRY.

11:58.651 --> 12:06.092
>> NO, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

12:06.092 --> 12:11.097
>> .

12:11.097 --> 12:16.202
>> WITH A GOAL IN MIND, TO MAKE
IT TO THE FINAL TWO.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.771
>> THAT IS STRONG MOTIVATION.

12:18.771 --> 12:20.806
>> EXTREMELY.

12:20.806 --> 12:26.078
WHAT IS YOUR MOTIVATION.

12:26.078 --> 12:34.920
>> BETWEEN YOUR-- THE ONLY
PEOPLE CONSISTENTY.

12:34.920 --> 12:39.525
>> I HAVE A ONE IN FIVE CHANCE
AT WINNING 750,000 DOLLARS, FOR

12:39.525 --> 12:42.561
ME IT ALL JUST COMES BACK TO
FAMILY.

12:42.561 --> 12:48.200
THE ABILITY TO HELP MY PARENTS,
MY GRANDPARENTS, MENS MORE TO ME

12:48.200 --> 12:50.536
THAN I KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN.

12:50.536 --> 12:53.372
>> EVERYTHING I'VE DONE IN MY
LIFE HAS BEEN MOTIVATED BY

12:53.372 --> 12:57.743
FAMILY INCLUDING THIS, MY
BROTHER.

12:57.743 --> 13:03.516
>> HE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.251
>> HUGE.

13:05.251 --> 13:11.157
>> I MADE A PROMISE TO MY
BROTHER, I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO

13:11.157 --> 13:13.826
MAKE SURE IS HE TAKEN CARE OF.

13:13.826 --> 13:17.062
AND NOW THAT HE IS NOT, SOMEONE
HAS GOT TO BE THERE.

13:17.062 --> 13:25.604
EVEN THOUGH THAT SOUNDS MOTHERY,
SHE LOOKED AFTER MY-- MY BIGGEST

13:25.604 --> 13:30.109
MOTIVATING FACT CERTIFICATE
BEING ABLE TO-- FOR MY NEPHEW.

13:30.109 --> 13:34.113
THAT IS WHY NO DISTRACTION.

13:34.113 --> 13:35.247
>> YEAH.

13:35.247 --> 13:42.087
>> I AM HERE TO DO WHAT I NEED
TO DO TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF

13:42.087 --> 13:44.690
MONEYK MY MOTIVATION TO GET TO
HIM IS EXTREMELY HIGH.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.593
>> THERE IS NOT A SINGLE DAY
THAT I AM IN THIS HOUSE THAT I

13:47.593 --> 13:53.332
DON'T THINK ABOUT MY BROTHER, I
DON'T THINK ABOUT MY NEPHEW, AND

13:53.332 --> 13:57.803
ME WINNING THIS MONEY WOULD GIVE
ME THE CHANCE TO DECIDE FOR MY

13:57.803 --> 14:00.239
NEPHEW THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE
CIRCUMSTANCES IS, IF HE NEEDS

14:00.239 --> 14:01.840
MONEY, HE'S TAKEN CARE.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.544
AND NIE MEF-- NEPHEW WANTS TO GO
TO COLLEGE AND GO TO ANY SCHOOL

14:05.544 --> 14:06.612
HE WANTS TO.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.714
IF IS MY BIGGEST MOT VACATION
FOR WINNING THIS GAME.

14:08.714 --> 14:12.251
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET ANYBODY
GET IN THE WAY OF THAT.

14:12.251 --> 14:22.294
>> PEOPLE WANT TO COME FOR ME,
I'M GOING TO-- .

14:22.294 --> 14:32.838
>> PEOPLE WANT TO COME FOR ME,
I'M GOING TO-- .

14:32.838 --> 14:42.514
>> HI.

14:42.514 --> 14:48.821
>> I VP BEEN AT SOMEBODY'S MERCY
.

14:48.821 --> 14:54.593
>> I KNOW, THAT I KNOW, THAT I
KNOW.

14:54.593 --> 14:58.797
>>-- SHE DOES NOT WANT ANYONE TO
TAKE YOU.

14:58.797 --> 14:59.298
>> RIGHT.

14:59.298 --> 14:59.932
>> I KNOW SHE IS.

14:59.932 --> 15:03.168
I ALREADY KNOW THAT.

15:03.168 --> 15:03.936
>> I LOVE HANNAH.

15:03.936 --> 15:07.206
>> I KNOW THAT.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.942
>> BUT I KNOW AT THE END I'M
KIND OF GOING FOR THAT MONEY,

15:09.942 --> 15:13.145
SHE DOESN'T CARE WHAT SHE
PROMISE NOBODY.

15:13.145 --> 15:20.119
>> IT IS NO MATTER WHO, IT CAN
HELP ME NO MATTER WHAT.

15:20.119 --> 15:24.356
BUT XAVIER GOT TO WORRY ABOUT
X-ZAVIER, HE ENDS UNDERTAKING

15:24.356 --> 15:26.792
OUT.

15:26.792 --> 15:34.400
>> X-ZAVIER GOING THIS WEEK, I
DON'T SEE NO WAY-- I DON'T SEE

15:34.400 --> 15:35.634
HIM HELPING ME.

15:35.634 --> 15:39.271
>> I DON'T THINK CAN I COUNT ON
BIG D'S VOTE BUT I FEEL PRETTY

15:39.271 --> 15:43.309
GOOD ABOUT AZAH, IF I ALREADY
HAVE AZAH THAN X-ZAVIER IS MY

15:43.309 --> 15:44.176
MAKE OR BREAK.

15:44.176 --> 15:46.645
IF I DON'T HAVE X-ZAVIER, I
DON'T STAY.

15:46.645 --> 15:51.083
I HAVE TO CONVINCE X-ZAVIER THAT
MI NOT JUST WHAT IS BETTER FOR

15:51.083 --> 16:04.830
HIS GAME, BUT I AM WHAT IS BEST
FOR HIS GAME.

16:04.830 --> 16:10.669
>> I'M HIS TARGET.

16:10.669 --> 16:12.938
IF I STAY, I AM STILL HIS
TARGET.

16:12.938 --> 16:18.243
YOU WANT ME THOUGHT WEEK, GOING
TO WANT ME OUT NEXT WEEK.

16:18.243 --> 16:21.246
IF I GO,-- YOU BECOME THE
TARGET.

16:21.246 --> 16:30.022
YOU GOT BIG D, WHY WOULD YOU GO
AFTER AZAH, I AM THE TAR GET.

16:30.022 --> 16:34.393
>> YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A SHOT
AT ME BUT HE FELT LIKE THE VOTES

16:34.393 --> 16:35.427
WEREN'T THERE.

16:35.427 --> 16:42.267
>> AS LONG AS I AM HERE, YOU CAN
TAKE A SHOT AT ME.

16:42.267 --> 16:48.240
ANY WAY-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ANYBODY IS GOING TO ARGUE

16:48.240 --> 16:52.778
AGAINST YOU.

16:52.778 --> 16:55.481
>> WE'RE DIFFERENT.

16:55.481 --> 16:58.717
SHE IS VERY UNEMOTIONAL ABOUT
PLIING THIS GAME.

16:58.717 --> 17:01.320
I THINK YOU WOULD BE CUT BY HER.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.723
AND SHE DOES NOT GET THE GAME, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT.

17:04.723 --> 17:05.824
>> TRUE.

17:05.824 --> 17:09.261
>> HAVE I BEEN VERY EMOTIONAL
ABOUT PLAYING THIS GAME.

17:09.261 --> 17:12.798
I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH SAYING
I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING I'M

17:12.798 --> 17:16.068
NOT GOING TO DO, HAVE I NO
CHOICE, OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

17:16.068 --> 17:20.839
KEPT ME HERE AND WOULD KEEP ME
HERE, PROBABLY, ARE YOU AND I.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.375
>> TIFFANY WOULD BE A SHIELD FOR
ME, HOWEVER CAN I TRUST HER

17:23.375 --> 17:24.543
MOVING FORWARD?

17:24.543 --> 17:28.046
OR IS SHE GOING TO TRY TO TAKE
ME OUT THE FIRST CHANCE SHE

17:28.046 --> 17:29.281
GETS.

17:29.281 --> 17:36.088
>> YOU KNOW JUST LIKE I DO,-- I
CAN TOTALLY PERSUADE TO GO THE

17:36.088 --> 17:36.855
OTHER WAY.

17:36.855 --> 17:44.830
>> I APPRECIATE YOU TALKING TO
ME.

17:44.830 --> 17:48.033
>> CHAS' UP, BROTHER.

17:48.033 --> 17:50.803
>> HOW ARE YOU DIDDING?

17:50.803 --> 17:51.437
>> FINE.

17:51.437 --> 17:52.438
>> TIFF IS TRYING HER BEST.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.239
>> SHE REALLY IS.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.542
>> SHE IS TRYING.

17:56.542 --> 18:01.013
SHE TOLD ME THAT ME SITTING NEXT
TO YOU, EVERYBODY VOTING FOR

18:01.013 --> 18:03.415
YOU, IF WE MAKE IT TO THE END.

18:03.415 --> 18:09.655
AND THEN SHE JUST TOLD ME THAT
HANNAH IS GOING TO GET RID OF ME

18:09.655 --> 18:14.059
CUZ HANNAH DOESN'T WANT ANYONE
TO BRING ME ALONG.

18:14.059 --> 18:16.829
>> SHE TOLD ME THAT HANNAH WANTS
TO TAKE ME OUT.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.398
HANNAH SITTING ON THE BLOCK
RIGHT NOW.

18:19.398 --> 18:22.468
SHE IS THINK BEING COMING AFTER
ME, AFTER YOU, AND HAS REASON TO

18:22.468 --> 18:25.671
GO AFTER KY.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.173
>> HANNAH HAS SHOWN THAT SHE IS
A FORMIDABLE COMPETITOR.

18:28.173 --> 18:30.175
SHE HAS WON H.O.H. AND VETO.

18:30.175 --> 18:33.812
SHE IS NOT ONLY-- IN WELL
CONNECTED IN THE JURY BUT ALSO

18:33.812 --> 18:37.382
IN THE LOUSE, SO IF WE TAKE
HANNAH OUT IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH

18:37.382 --> 18:39.718
EASIER FOR US TO GET TO FINAL
THREE.

18:39.718 --> 18:42.721
>> BETWEEN TIFFANY, HANNAH MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE MORE OF A THREAT.

18:42.721 --> 18:46.592
>> YES, SHE IS.

18:46.592 --> 18:50.462
>> Julie: UP NEXT, WE TALK
WITH THE COOKOUT FOR THE FIRST

18:50.462 --> 18:56.101
TIME SINCE BECOMING THE FINAL
SIX.

18:56.101 --> 19:01.306
THEN SECRETS AND LIES UNFOLD
WHEN SARAH BETH JOINS THE JURY.

19:01.306 --> 19:05.477
PLUS EITHER TIFFANY OR HANNAH
WILL BE HEADED TO JURY BUT THE

19:05.477 --> 19:09.548
DRAM A DOESN'T END THERE BECAUSE
THE HOUSE GESESES STILL DON'T

19:09.548 --> 19:12.284
KNOW THAT TONIGHT IS DOUBLE
EVICTION NIGHT.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.785
STAY WITH US.

19:27.533 --> 19:31.036
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO BIG
BROTHER, THEY HAVE DOMINATED THE

19:31.036 --> 19:34.873
GAME ALL SUMMER LONG.

19:34.873 --> 19:38.510
LET'S TALK WITH THE COOKOUT
ABOUT THEIR INCREDIBLE RUN.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.878
HELLO HOUSEGUESTS.

19:39.878 --> 19:40.746
>> HI JULIE.

19:40.746 --> 19:49.221
>> Julie: OR SHOULD I SAY
HELLO COOKOUT.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.990
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO BE THE FIRST
TO OFFICIALLY CONGRATULATE THE

19:51.990 --> 19:55.861
SIX OF YOU ON ACHIEVING YOUR
MISSION.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.430
>> THANK YOU, JULIE, WE
APPRECIATE IT.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.265
>> THAT GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.568
>> Julie: BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU
HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE

20:02.568 --> 20:06.872
COOKOUT ALLIANCE YOU HAVE
GUARANTEED THAT THE FIRST

20:06.872 --> 20:15.013
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WINNER OF BIG
BROTHER WILL BE CROWNED THIS

20:15.013 --> 20:19.985
YEAR I I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS, I
WANT TO TART START WITH YOU,

20:19.985 --> 20:23.355
TIFFANY, WHY WAS HELPING TO FORM
THE COOKOUT ALLIANCE AND SEEING

20:23.355 --> 20:27.025
IT TO THE END SO IMPORTANT TO
YOU PERSONALLY.

20:27.025 --> 20:30.729
>> I WANTED TO COME HERE TO
ENSURE THAT SOMEONE LIKE ME HAD

20:30.729 --> 20:35.167
AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO THE END
AND WIN THIS GAME.

20:35.167 --> 20:38.770
WHEN I WALKED IN THE DOOR AND
FIVE OTHER BEAUTIFUL FACES LIKE

20:38.770 --> 20:40.839
MINE, I COULD NOT EVER TARGET
THEM.

20:40.839 --> 20:44.743
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
WORKED TOGETHER TO GET TO THE

20:44.743 --> 20:48.246
END SO THAT IT, AT LEAST TWO OF
US WAS IN THOSE SEATS.

20:48.246 --> 20:50.916
I KNEW ONE OF US WOULD WIN,
WHETHER IT WAS ME OR NOT.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.117
AND WE ALL HAD THE SAME GOAL.

20:52.117 --> 20:55.387
IT WAS NEVER A QUESTION ABOUT
IT, IT WAS AN AMAZING FEAT BUT

20:55.387 --> 20:57.489
WE DID IT AND I'M VERY PROUD.

20:57.489 --> 21:01.893
>> Julie: YES, YOU DID, YOU
ALL DID IT, LET ME MOVE ON TO

21:01.893 --> 21:07.232
X-ZAVIER, TELL ME WHAT IT MEANT
TO YOU WHEN YOU REALIZED THE SIX

21:07.232 --> 21:14.172
OF YOU HAD FINALLY MADE IT TO
THE END TOGETHER.

21:14.172 --> 21:20.112
>> IT WAS GROUNDS BREAK PAING T
SOLIDIFIED THE FACT THAT AN

21:20.112 --> 21:22.381
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WINNER WAS
GOING TO WIN, I WAS SAD TO SEE

21:22.381 --> 21:25.884
ALYSSA GO BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
IT WAS NICE KNOWING THAT ALL OF

21:25.884 --> 21:27.552
OUR HARD WORK PAID OFF.

21:27.552 --> 21:31.556
AND YEAH, I HAD SAD TEARS AND
HAPPY TEARS.

21:31.556 --> 21:32.724
>> WELL SAID.

21:32.724 --> 21:33.859
BIG D?

21:33.859 --> 21:35.560
>> HELLO BIG D.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.596
>> HEY JULIE WHAT IS UP, BABY.

21:37.596 --> 21:39.564
>> Julie: THANK YOU, I WAS
WAITING FOR THAT, THANK YOU, I

21:39.564 --> 21:40.632
FEEL BETTER NOW.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.135
HERE IS MY QUESTION TO YOU, BIG
D.

21:43.135 --> 21:47.506
WAS IT EVER A CHALLENGE TO KEEP
THIS GROUP TOGETHER AND ACHIEVE

21:47.506 --> 21:48.473
ITS MISSION?

21:48.473 --> 21:51.576
>> YES, IT WAS, JULIE.

21:51.576 --> 21:52.411
IT WAS A BIG CHALLENGE.

21:52.411 --> 21:53.645
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.782
I MEAN JUST TO HAVE ALL SIX OF
US HERE IN THAT MOMENT AND KNOW

21:56.782 --> 22:01.553
THAT WE MADE IT TO THE FINAL
SIX, EVERYTHING WE DID WAS WORTH

22:01.553 --> 22:02.688
IT.

22:02.688 --> 22:03.889
ALL THE FIGHTS, ALL THE ARGUING,
EVERYTHING WAS WORTH IT.

22:03.889 --> 22:10.128
SO I AM VERY HAPPY AND I LOVE
EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

22:10.128 --> 22:11.296
THESE PEOPLE.

22:11.296 --> 22:15.367
>> Julie: THANK YOU BIG D,
HANNAH, ALMOST ALL OF YOU IN THE

22:15.367 --> 22:18.036
COOKOUT, ALL ALMOST ALL OF YOU
HAD A SIDE ALLIANCE OUTSIDE OF

22:18.036 --> 22:23.008
THE COOKOUT THAT YOU ALL AGREED
TO CUT LOOSE WHEN NEEDED TO

22:23.008 --> 22:25.477
ADVANCE THE MISSION.

22:25.477 --> 22:25.744
>> WHAT?

22:25.744 --> 22:26.478
WHAT?

22:26.478 --> 22:28.046
>> Julie: YOU ARE LIKE WHO,
US?

22:28.046 --> 22:31.550
BUT HANNAH, HUGH DIFFICULT WAS
IT FOR YOU TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO

22:31.550 --> 22:34.886
YOUR PLUS ONE DEREK F.

22:34.886 --> 22:40.992
>> OH GOD, I WAS A HOT MESS WHEN
I HAD TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO DEREK

22:40.992 --> 22:42.094
X.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.929
I DEFINITELY FELT BAD JUST
BECAUSE YOU YOU HAVE SOMEONE

22:43.929 --> 22:48.300
HERE WHO HAS CHOSEN TO PUT 100%
OF THEIR LOYALTY AND TRUST IN

22:48.300 --> 22:49.401
YOU.

22:49.401 --> 22:53.538
AND I KIND OF FELT LIKE I
BETRAYED HIM IN THAT SENSE.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.308
BUT FOR ME OUR MISSION AND THE
COOKOUT ALWAYS CAME FIRST, THERE

22:56.308 --> 22:57.442
WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

22:57.442 --> 23:01.747
SO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A
NECESSARY EVIL BUT SHOUT OUT TO

23:01.747 --> 23:02.848
DX, HE'S GREAT.

23:02.848 --> 23:06.184
>> Julie: THANK YOU, KYLAND,
HOW HARD WAS IT TO BALANCE

23:06.184 --> 23:09.821
PLAYING A PERSONAL GAME TO WIN
THE $750,000 GRAND PRIZE ON ONE

23:09.821 --> 23:13.825
SIDE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE TO
FULFILL THE MISSION OF THE

23:13.825 --> 23:15.060
COOKOUT?

23:15.060 --> 23:20.265
>> I MEAN IT ADDED A LAYER TO
THE GAME THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN

23:20.265 --> 23:22.768
BEFORE IN THE SENSE THAT YOU ARE
MAKING DECISIONS NOT JUST TO GET

23:22.768 --> 23:25.837
TO THE END BUT TO MOVE SIX
PEOPLE SAFELY THROUGH ANOTHER

23:25.837 --> 23:26.505
WEEK.

23:26.505 --> 23:27.672
AND AT TIMES THOSE CONFLICTED.

23:27.672 --> 23:30.942
AND WHEN THOSE DID CONFLICT,
EACH OF US HAD ALREADY AGREED

23:30.942 --> 23:35.046
THAT WE WOULD PICK THE TEAM, THE
COOKOUT, THE MISSION OVER IT.

23:35.046 --> 23:42.120
AND THOSE WERE THE TOUGH MOMENTS
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE RISKING

23:42.120 --> 23:45.157
YOUR GAME BUT ALL OF US CAME
HERE AND WE IMMEDIATELY KNEW

23:45.157 --> 23:47.993
THAT THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE
ABOUT, IT WAS UNSPOKEN, SO IT

23:47.993 --> 23:51.163
WAS A CHALLENGE BUT LIKE
EVERYONE HAS SAID T WAS CLEARLY

23:51.163 --> 23:52.330
WORTH IT.

23:52.330 --> 23:54.299
>> Julie: THEY ARE TELLING ME
OUT OF TIME, AZAH, HAVE I TO

23:54.299 --> 23:59.037
TALK TO YOU, NOT ONLY DID
GETTING THE COOKOUT TO THE END

23:59.037 --> 24:01.173
GUARANTEE THE FIRST
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WINNER, YOU SIX

24:01.173 --> 24:07.646
ALSO MADE BIG BROTHER HIS ARE
TREE BY BEING THE FIRST SIX

24:07.646 --> 24:10.882
PERSONAL-- SIX-PERSON ALLIANCE
TO MAKE IT THIS FAR IN TACT.

24:10.882 --> 24:15.554
WERE THERE MOMENTS ALONG THE WAY
YOU DOUBTED THIS ACHIEVEMENT WAS

24:15.554 --> 24:17.055
POSSIBLE?

24:17.055 --> 24:18.490
>> MOST DEFINITELY.

24:18.490 --> 24:23.061
WHEN I DOUBTED THOSE MOMENTS
WERE WHEN A FEW OF MY ALLIANCE

24:23.061 --> 24:24.296
WERE H.O.H.

24:24.296 --> 24:28.400
BUT NO SHADE, NO SHADE, THE ONE
THING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS I

24:28.400 --> 24:32.871
BELIEVE IN SOMETHING CALLED
FAITH AND THAT THE EVIDENCE

24:32.871 --> 24:37.142
BEFORE AND SUS AT THE NANCE OF
NOT YET SEEN, HI FAITH IN THIS

24:37.142 --> 24:40.545
EVEN IF I FELT IT WAS SOMETHING
THAT COULD NOT HAPPEN, I HAD TO

24:40.545 --> 24:43.748
LOOK LIKE IT CAN, IT SHALL AND
NOW WE ARE ALL HERE, EVERYTHING

24:43.748 --> 24:46.518
WE MADE WHILE IT MIGHT SEEM
REGRET AT THE TIME, WE CAN'T

24:46.518 --> 24:47.385
REGRET IT AT ALL.

24:47.385 --> 24:49.421
AND IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.256
I'M SO HAPPY MI WITH YOU ALL
TODAY.

24:51.256 --> 24:54.059
SO HAPPY I'M FRIENDS WITH THIS
PERSON HERE THAT I HAD DOUBTEDS

24:54.059 --> 24:57.262
IN, BUT WE ALL TRUST EACH OTHER
AND THAT IS WHAT MATTERS.

24:57.262 --> 24:58.830
>> Julie: FAITH, I LOVE THAT
WORD.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.600
ONE OF MY FAVORITE WORDS, THANK
YOU EVERYONE.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.569
AND CONGRATULATIONS, BACK TO THE
GAME, MY GAME FACE, I WILL BE

25:04.569 --> 25:07.572
BACK BEFORE YOU KNOW IT WITH A
VOTE AND EVICTION.

25:07.572 --> 25:11.009
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU COOKOUT.

25:11.009 --> 25:15.814
>> AS THE JURY GROWS, SO TOO
DOES THE REALIZATION THAT THERE

25:15.814 --> 25:23.121
HAS BEEN A SECRET ALLIANCE
RUNNING THE GAME FROM THE

25:23.121 --> 25:24.923
BEGINNING.

25:24.923 --> 25:27.559
>> WE THINK IT IS SOMEONE IN
THIS HOUSE.

25:27.559 --> 25:29.160
>> I HOPE IT IS SARAH BETH.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.529
>> I THINK THE ONLY WAY SARAH
BETH DOES NOT WALK THROUGH THIS

25:31.529 --> 25:33.665
DOOR IS IF KYLAND WON AN H.O.H.

25:33.665 --> 25:37.168
>> YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS, IS LIKE
WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LONG TIME IN

25:37.168 --> 25:39.871
JURY SO I WANT TO SEE PEOPLE
THAT I ENJOY HANGING OUT WITH

25:39.871 --> 25:41.907
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WANT THEM
TO WIN THE GAME.

25:41.907 --> 25:45.010
>> CORRECT, THAT IS WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO SEE YOU, THANKS FOR

25:45.010 --> 25:45.911
COMING.

25:45.911 --> 25:47.112
>> THANKS FOR RUBBING IT IN MY
FACE AGAIN.

25:47.112 --> 25:50.649
>> I WAS HERE FIRST.

25:50.649 --> 25:51.549
>> THAT'S TRUE.

25:51.549 --> 25:54.452
>> YO-YO YO.

25:54.452 --> 25:57.989
>> IN THE JURY HOUSE.

25:57.989 --> 25:59.224
>> SB.

25:59.224 --> 26:03.561
>> BEING EVICTED FROM THE BIG
BROTHER HOUSE IS TOUGH TO TAKE.

26:03.561 --> 26:04.963
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT.

26:04.963 --> 26:07.565
IT STINKS, I HATE THAT I AM
HERE.

26:07.565 --> 26:11.102
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF.

26:11.102 --> 26:12.270
AND EMBARRASSED.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.139
IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD.

26:14.139 --> 26:14.973
NOT A GOOD FEELING.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.841
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE.

26:16.841 --> 26:21.446
>> I HAVE REALLY MIXED EMOTIONS
ABOUT SEEING SARAH BETH.

26:21.446 --> 26:24.950
I WOULD HAVE LOVED WOONT HAVE
LOVED SEEING HER WIN THIS GAME

26:24.950 --> 26:26.451
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DIDN'T
WANT TO SEE HER IN JURY YET

26:26.451 --> 26:29.120
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE GETTING
SARAH BETH OUT OF THE HOUSE WAS

26:29.120 --> 26:33.425
AN EMOTIONAL MOVE, WHEREAS THERE
ARE STILL STRONG PLAYERS IN THE

26:33.425 --> 26:36.895
HOUSE THAT I PERSONALLY WOULD
WANT TO GET OUT BEFORE SARAH

26:36.895 --> 26:37.896
BETH.

26:37.896 --> 26:41.399
>> WAIT, SO WHAT HAPPENED?

26:41.399 --> 26:44.269
WITHIN SO MUCH HAPPENED, I COULD
TELL YOU BUT IT WOULD BE MUCH

26:44.269 --> 26:46.471
MORE FUN TO SHOW YOU, YOU WANT
TO SEE, LET'S GO.

26:46.471 --> 26:48.273
>> LET'S GO SEE, LET'S GO.

26:48.273 --> 26:51.443
ALL RIGHT GUYS, LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.044
>> ALL RIGHT.

26:53.044 --> 26:55.246
>> OH NO.

26:55.246 --> 26:57.882
>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS TO
YOU, TIFFANY.

26:57.882 --> 27:02.787
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

27:02.787 --> 27:03.321
>> TIFFANY.

27:03.321 --> 27:04.456
>> I'M SUPER-- OKAY.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.458
>> OH MY GOSH.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.694
>> X-ZAVIER, BECAUSE YOU CHOSE
THE THIRD NOMINEE PUNISHMENT AND

27:09.694 --> 27:13.732
LAST WEEK'S VETO COMPETITION,
YOU ARE NOW ON THE BLOCK AS THE

27:13.732 --> 27:16.368
THIRD NOMINEE.

27:16.368 --> 27:21.072
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS.

27:21.072 --> 27:26.277
THE NECK HOUSEGUEST HAVE I
NOMINATED IS.

27:26.277 --> 27:29.414
>> HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU GO
HOME?

27:29.414 --> 27:31.483
YOU WERE UP AGAIN THE TWO
BIGGEST THREATS IN THE HOUSE AND

27:31.483 --> 27:32.917
YOU'RE HERE?

27:32.917 --> 27:34.552
OH MY GOD.

27:34.552 --> 27:36.321
SO NOW WE HAVE A VETO.

27:36.321 --> 27:40.892
>> NO, WE HAVE THE-- COIN TWIST.

27:40.892 --> 27:49.534
>> THE COIN OF DESTINY WAS
PLAYED IN THE HIGH ROLLERS ROOM.

27:49.534 --> 27:56.908
THE COIN HAS LANDED ON-- HANNAH
WITHIN I'VE BEEN DETHROWNED.

27:56.908 --> 27:57.876
>> WHAT?

27:57.876 --> 28:03.381
>> THE SECRET H.O.H.'S FIRST
NOMINEE IS KYLAND.

28:03.381 --> 28:07.519
THEIR SECOND NOMINEE IS SARAH
BETH.

28:07.519 --> 28:12.157
>> HOW DID YOU END UP IN THIS
HOUSE?

28:12.157 --> 28:15.093
>> CLAIRE OFF ALSO REVIEWED SHE
WAS THE SECRET H.O.H.

28:15.093 --> 28:16.661
>> I WAS THE ANONYMOUS H.O.H.

28:16.661 --> 28:20.165
AND I DID PUT YOU AND KYLAND UP
WITHIN WHICH MEANS SHE CAN'T WIN

28:20.165 --> 28:21.266
THIS NEXT H.O.H. COMP.

28:21.266 --> 28:22.067
THE ONLY WAY.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.536
>> THE SECRET H.O.H. CAN'T WIN.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.103
>> HUH-UH.

28:25.103 --> 28:26.071
>> I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.273
>> THEY HAVE TO THROW IT, SHE
CAN'T BE H.O.H.

28:28.273 --> 28:30.608
SO CLAIRE IS DEFINITELY GOING ON
THE BLOCK.

28:30.608 --> 28:34.746
AND IS MOST LIKELY GOING TO BE
THE NEXT JUROR.

28:34.746 --> 28:37.248
>> HANNAH, CONGRATULATIONS, YOU
WON THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

28:37.248 --> 28:42.287
>> I WON SOMETHING.

28:42.287 --> 28:43.154
>> LET'S GO!

28:43.154 --> 28:44.022
>> SHUT UP.

28:44.022 --> 28:44.556
>> LET'S GO.

28:44.556 --> 28:48.827
OH MY GD!

28:48.827 --> 28:51.296
>> OKAY, SO CHADA WINS VETO.

28:51.296 --> 28:59.237
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO ON X-ZAVIER.

28:59.237 --> 28:59.504
>> WHAT?

28:59.504 --> 28:59.838
OKAY.

28:59.838 --> 29:01.005
ALL RIGHT.

29:01.005 --> 29:02.107
HE SHOULD BE.

29:02.107 --> 29:04.876
>> HE SHOULD BE THE TARGET,
LOGICALLY HE SHOULD BE THE

29:04.876 --> 29:05.610
TARGET.

29:05.610 --> 29:07.378
>>
>> Julie: SARAH BETH, YOU ARE

29:07.378 --> 29:10.415
EVICTED FROM THE BIG BROTHER
HOUSE.

29:10.415 --> 29:14.519
>> AND THEN I GOT MY GOOD-BYE
MESSAGES.

29:14.519 --> 29:16.421
>> OKAY, THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO
HEAR.

29:16.421 --> 29:20.692
>> I HAD TO BE OKAY WITH YOU
LEECHING THE HOUSE IN ORDER TO

29:20.692 --> 29:24.329
FURTHER A MISSION THAT IS VERY
IMPORTANT AND CLOSE TO MY HEART.

29:24.329 --> 29:28.166
>> UNFORTUNATELY, THE SECRET
ALLIANCE WHICH I AM A PART OF,

29:28.166 --> 29:29.567
WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO TAKE YOU
ANY FURTHER.

29:29.567 --> 29:35.440
>> I THINK IT IS KYLAND, AZAH,
BIG D, XAVIER, CHADA AND TIFFANY

29:35.440 --> 29:37.375
ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER.

29:37.375 --> 29:42.680
>> A PERSONAL MISSION, THAT IS
VERY IMPORTANT TO AZAH?

29:42.680 --> 29:43.982
>> THERE HAS NEVER BEEN.

29:43.982 --> 29:46.985
>> OKAY, THAT MAKES SENSE.

29:46.985 --> 29:47.619
>> OKAY.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.120
>> AS WINNER OF BIG BROTHER.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.488
>> MAKES SENSE.

29:50.488 --> 29:51.222
>> REALLY?

29:51.222 --> 29:52.924
>> YEAH, NEVER BEEN.

29:52.924 --> 29:53.925
>> BLACK FEMALE OR.

29:53.925 --> 29:54.626
>> JUST A BLACK WINNER AT ALL.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.026
>> REALLY.

29:55.026 --> 29:55.593
I HAD NO IDEA.

29:55.593 --> 29:55.894
>> BLACK WINNER AT ALL.

29:55.894 --> 29:58.463
>> YEAH.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.965
>> SO THAT IS DEFINITELY WHAT IS
GOING ON.

30:00.965 --> 30:04.869
OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND AND SIM
PATHIZE WITH WHY THEY WOULD FORM

30:04.869 --> 30:06.104
THAT ALLIANCE.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.473
>> MAKES SENSE, BECAUSE I JUST
THINK ABOUT TO VAN ALLIANCE THAT

30:08.473 --> 30:11.543
FORMS WEEK ONE, TO STICK THROUGH
ALL THE WAY UNTIL NOW, IT IS

30:11.543 --> 30:14.245
LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE PLAYING FOR
SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF,

30:14.245 --> 30:17.448
I THINK FOR WHAT THEY ARE TRYING
TO DO, IT SEEMS LIKE A NOBLE

30:17.448 --> 30:20.051
MISSION, I APPLAUD THEM FOR IT,
I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE

30:20.051 --> 30:22.921
HOW FAR THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
KEEP THIS ALLIANCE TOGETHER

30:22.921 --> 30:24.022
SINCE WEEK ONE.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.524
AND IF I COULD HAVE DONE THE
SAME THING, I WOULD HAVE.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.927
BECAUSE EVERYONE AT EVERY POINT
OF THIS GAME COULD HAVE MADE A

30:28.927 --> 30:33.932
MOVE THAT WAS BETTER FOR THEIR
PERSONAL GAME BUT CHOSE NOT TO.

30:33.932 --> 30:35.133
>> YEAH.

30:35.133 --> 30:36.868
>> HONESTLY I'M IMPRESSED THEY
TAKE IT TO THE FINAL SIX, LIKE

30:36.868 --> 30:38.136
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE.

30:38.136 --> 30:43.341
IF THEY FORMED THIS WEEK ONE, SO
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON KYLAND

30:43.341 --> 30:44.576
RIGHT NOW?

30:44.576 --> 30:47.312
>> I COMPLETELY RESPECT THAT HE
CHOSE NOT TO TELL ME, HE KNOWS

30:47.312 --> 30:51.316
WHAT TYPE OF PLAYER, I WOULD
HAVE BLOWN IT UP IN A HOT

30:51.316 --> 30:51.616
SECOND.

30:51.616 --> 30:52.750
>> 100%.

30:52.750 --> 31:00.558
>> I AM STRUGGLING WITH ALL
THE-- THE KFERGS THAT WE HAD

31:00.558 --> 31:04.729
THAT HE DIDN'T NEED TO BE HAD.

31:04.729 --> 31:07.332
AND THE SO IT IS PAINFUL FOR ME.

31:07.332 --> 31:11.402
>> AT THIS POINT I THINK KYLAND
THE WITH UNTHAT ANNOYS ME THE

31:11.402 --> 31:15.773
MOST IN THE HOUSE, AND IF THE
APPLIANCE WANTS TO STICK

31:15.773 --> 31:18.309
TOGETHER, BUT AT THE END OF THE
DAY YOU HAVE TO ELIMINATE EACH

31:18.309 --> 31:22.447
OTHER AT SOME POINT AND WHOEVER
GETS KYLAND OUT OF THE GAME IS

31:22.447 --> 31:24.182
GETTING SERIOUS PROPS FROM ME.

31:24.182 --> 31:29.787
>> THAT WAS A SERIOUS WEEK, YOU
HAD TO UNPACK A LOT BUT NOW

31:29.787 --> 31:31.322
UNPACK YOUR BAGS.

31:31.322 --> 31:32.624
>> YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

31:32.624 --> 31:33.224
>> AFTER THAT LINE.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.325
>> WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE.

31:34.325 --> 31:38.863
>> Julie: UP NEXT, THE
COOKOUT'S SUCCESS SENDS TWO MORE

31:38.863 --> 31:40.798
BLIND SIDED HOUSE DPESES TO THE
JURY HOUSE.

31:40.798 --> 31:48.172
THEN TIFFANY OR HANNAH WILL BE
HEADED OUT THE DOOR.

31:48.172 --> 31:52.176
FIRST HE VIRKS IS JUST AROUND
THE CORNER, THIS SECRETARY

31:52.176 --> 31:53.044
DOUBLE EVICTION EPISODE
CONTINUES WHEN WE REASON, STAY

31:53.044 --> 31:53.611
WITH US.

32:05.390 --> 32:08.593
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO BIG
BROTHER, AS CLAIRE AND ALYSSA

32:08.593 --> 32:17.969
ARRIVE AT THE JURY HOUSE
HINDSIGHT BECOMES 20-20.

32:17.969 --> 32:21.572
>> OKAY, SO COULD THIS BE THE
WEEK THAT PEOPLE BREAK UP THE

32:21.572 --> 32:22.774
ALLIANCE.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.409
>> I FEEL LIKE IF THEY WERE
WILLING TO DO IT BEFORE THE SIX

32:24.409 --> 32:27.178
THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT LAST
WEEK, BECAUSE THERE WAS REALLY

32:27.178 --> 32:30.615
NO GOOD REASON TO KEEP A PLAYER
LIKE KYLAND IN THE GAME AND SEND

32:30.615 --> 32:31.783
ME HOME.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.851
>> WE THINK THERE IS A SECRET
ALLIANCE OF SIX PEOPLE AND I

32:33.851 --> 32:36.821
THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE LEFT IN
THE HOUSE THAT ARE NOT IN THE

32:36.821 --> 32:39.157
SECRET ALLIANCE ARE CLAIRE AND
ALYSSA SO I WOULD NOT BE

32:39.157 --> 32:41.726
SURPRISED AT ALL IF ONE OF THEM
CAME INTO THE DOOR.

32:41.726 --> 32:44.696
>> WHO DO WE THINK IS COMING
INTO THE HOUSE.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.665
>> CLAIRE OR ALYSSA, PROBABLY
CLAIRE, WE SHOULD SAVE SOME OF

32:47.665 --> 32:54.272
THIS ALCOHOL FOR HER BECAUSE
SHE'S GOING TO NEED IT.

32:54.272 --> 32:55.373
>> NO!

32:55.373 --> 32:57.175
>> OH MY GOD.

32:57.175 --> 33:03.114
>> IT FEELS WEIRD TO HAVE BEEN
PUT ON THE BLOCK AND EVICTED BY

33:03.114 --> 33:05.350
MY CLOSEST ALLY IN THE GAME.

33:05.350 --> 33:09.020
BUT EVEN THOUGH I'M DISAPPOINTED
AND HEARTBROKEN, I ALSO DON'T

33:09.020 --> 33:10.722
THINK THERE WAS MUCH I COULD
HAVE DONE.

33:10.722 --> 33:13.324
>> HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW RIGHT
NOW?

33:13.324 --> 33:16.394
>> WELL, I KNOW THAT SOMEONE
ELSE IS GOING TO BE JOINING US.

33:16.394 --> 33:16.928
>> A DOUBLE.

33:16.928 --> 33:17.829
>> THERE IS A DOUBLE.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.130
>> OH MY GOD.

33:19.130 --> 33:22.734
>> THERE'S A DOUBLE.

33:22.734 --> 33:23.668
>> OKAY.

33:23.668 --> 33:27.105
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS, I HAVE
SOME GUESSES.

33:27.105 --> 33:28.706
AS TO WHO IT PROBABLY WOULD BE.

33:28.706 --> 33:34.445
>> WE THINK-- I THINK ALYSSA IS
THE MOST LIKELY.

33:34.445 --> 33:34.846
>> ALYSSA.

33:34.846 --> 33:35.546
>> OH MY GOD.

33:35.546 --> 33:41.953
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

33:41.953 --> 33:46.724
>> THEY ARE NOT LOYAL TO YOU,
ALYSSA.

33:46.724 --> 33:49.761
>> DOUBLE EVICTION WAS INTENSE
AND VERY EYE-OPENING.

33:49.761 --> 33:52.597
IT DEFINITELY SUCKED BECAUSE I
WAS NOT THE BIGGEST THREAT IN

33:52.597 --> 33:53.731
THE HOUSE.

33:53.731 --> 33:55.833
I DO THINK THERE ARE BIGGER
TARGETS THAT THEY COULD HAVE

33:55.833 --> 33:58.069
TAKEN A SHOT AT.

33:58.069 --> 34:01.639
>> HONESTLY IMPRESSIVE THEY MADE
IT TO SIX, HONESTLY IMPRESSIVE.

34:01.639 --> 34:02.907
>> DID YOU KNOW.

34:02.907 --> 34:04.909
>> I HAD A HUNCH.

34:04.909 --> 34:08.312
>> I THEY TOOK YOU OUT IN A
DOUBLE.

34:08.312 --> 34:09.947
>> I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

34:09.947 --> 34:12.550
>> Y'ALL, IT WAS A WILD, WILD
WEEK.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.085
WE JUST HAVE TO WATCH IT.

34:14.085 --> 34:16.721
>> ALL RIGHT.

34:16.721 --> 34:21.359
>> READY.

34:21.359 --> 34:22.026
>> OH.

34:22.026 --> 34:23.227
DAMN.

34:23.227 --> 34:26.798
>> I HAD TO THROW THIS COMP
BECAUSE I WAS THE SECRET H.O.H.

34:26.798 --> 34:28.733
>> WHO TOOK YOU OUT.

34:28.733 --> 34:35.139
>> YOU'LL SEE.

34:35.139 --> 34:40.311
>> OH, CONGRATULATIONS, TIFFANY,
ARE YOU NOW THE NEW HEAD OF

34:40.311 --> 34:42.613
HOUSEHOLD.

34:42.613 --> 34:46.717
>> THANK YOU.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.419
>> WHAT?

34:48.419 --> 34:48.920
>> WHAT?

34:48.920 --> 34:50.021
>> YOU ARE KIDDING.

34:50.021 --> 34:54.459
>> TIFFANY DID NOT TAKE YOU OUT.

34:54.459 --> 34:55.092
>> YEAH.

34:55.092 --> 34:55.493
>> WHAT?

34:55.493 --> 34:56.394
>> OH MY GOD.

34:56.394 --> 34:58.162
THAT'S MESSED UP.

34:58.162 --> 34:58.729
>> HOW?

34:58.729 --> 35:00.164
>> IT WAS A ROUGH WEEK.

35:00.164 --> 35:04.602
>> TIFFANY IS THE LAST PERSON
THAT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO BE

35:04.602 --> 35:06.070
H.O.H. THIS WEEK AND SENT
CLAIRE.

35:06.070 --> 35:10.007
I WANT TO GIVE MY VOTE TO WHO I
THINK IS PLAYING REALLY

35:10.007 --> 35:12.977
STRATEGIC GAME PLAY.

35:12.977 --> 35:15.613
>> I AM NOT GOING TO LIE.

35:15.613 --> 35:25.656
>> THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST HAVE I
NOMINATED IS.

35:25.656 --> 35:31.095
>> THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST HAVE I
NOMINATED IS.

35:31.095 --> 35:33.931
>> OKAY, SO HOW ARE YOU FEELING
NOW AFTER NOM.

35:33.931 --> 35:35.666
>> TO BE EXPECTED, WE THOUGHT
ALYSSA AND X WERE COMING AFTER

35:35.666 --> 35:40.471
US SO WE THEEDED TO GO AFTER
THEM, IT WAS WHO COULD GET WHO

35:40.471 --> 35:41.272
FIRST.

35:41.272 --> 35:48.913
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S WATCH THIS
VETO.

35:48.913 --> 35:49.780
>> X STEPPING OUT.

35:49.780 --> 35:57.688
>> HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT A MINT
JULEP WAS.

35:57.688 --> 35:59.090
>> NO.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.558
>> .

36:00.558 --> 36:00.892
>> YES!

36:00.892 --> 36:03.694
OH MY GOD.

36:03.694 --> 36:06.030
IT WAS AWESOME.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.265
>> OH MY GOD.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.534
>> TIFFANY AT THIS POINT MUST BE
DEVASTATED.

36:09.534 --> 36:11.202
>> SHE IS DEVASTATED.

36:11.202 --> 36:15.606
AT THIS POINT I'M NOT THAT BAD,
MAYBE I-- IS GOING HOME THIS

36:15.606 --> 36:21.679
WEEK, WE'LL PUT BIG D UP AND X

36:21.679 --> 36:26.751
BIT EXCITED, I'M LIKE GOOD JOB
LYSS.

36:26.751 --> 36:31.756
>> THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT
DECISION, HOWEVER CLAIRE, I AM

36:31.756 --> 36:36.227
CHOOSING TO REPLACE MY
NOMINATION WITH YOU.

36:36.227 --> 36:38.429
>> I'M DYING TO KNOW, WHAT HAVE
YOU BEEN TOLD WITHIN SO NIGHT

36:38.429 --> 36:41.732
BEFORE THE VETO MEETING AND SHE
PULLS ME UP AND SHE IS LIKE

36:41.732 --> 36:43.734
CLAIRE, I'VE REALLY BEEN
STRUGGLING.

36:43.734 --> 36:48.039
HAVE I BEEN TRYING TO RUN
SCENARIOS AND I AM BASICALLY

36:48.039 --> 36:49.273
PUTTING YOU UP.

36:49.273 --> 36:53.444
SHE IS LIKE I JUST TOLD MYSELF
COMING TOO THE GAME, ESSENTIALLY

36:53.444 --> 36:56.213
THAT I WOULD LOOK OUT FOR THE
OTHER BLACK PLAYERS.

36:56.213 --> 36:59.617
I GENUINELY AM NOT MAD AT HER,
HOW CAN I FAULT HER FOR DOING

36:59.617 --> 37:02.053
WHAT SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO
COME IN HERE TO DO.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.089
I DO JUST HAVE TO RESPECT AND
ADMIRE HER AND HER CHARACTER

37:05.089 --> 37:06.958
BECAUSE THAT IS SUCH A HARD
CHOICE TO MAKE.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.759
>> DO YOU STILL WANT HER TO WIN.

37:08.759 --> 37:13.164
>> OF COURSE SWRZ BY A VOTE OF
4-1, CLAIRE YOU ARE EVICTED FROM

37:13.164 --> 37:15.700
THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

37:15.700 --> 37:19.570
>> SORRY, CLAIRE.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.238
>> OH MY GOD.

37:21.238 --> 37:24.909
>> SO NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
DOUBLE.

37:24.909 --> 37:25.943
>> SEE HOW YOU GOT OUT.

37:25.943 --> 37:29.213
>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS,
HANNAH, SIX OUT OF SEVEN

37:29.213 --> 37:31.182
CORRECT, ARE YOU THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

37:31.182 --> 37:32.817
>> I'M SO EXCITED FOR HER.

37:32.817 --> 37:35.786
>> THIS IS NOT A PERSONAL MOVE.

37:35.786 --> 37:40.057
THIS IS TO FURTHER MY GAME,
X-ZAVIER AND ALYSSA PLEASE TAKE

37:40.057 --> 37:43.394
YOUR SEATS IN THE NOMINATION
CHAIRS, YOU GUYS ARE A STRONG

DUO, AND CLAIRE WAS RIGHT,
X-ZAVIER, YOU'RE A THREAT.

37:47.465 --> 37:51.669

RIGHT NOW, SO HANNAH IS TELLING

37:51.669 --> 37:57.675
ME X IS THE TARGET, IF X GOES
DOWN, KY GOES UP, AND I'M

BELIEVING IT.

38:02.046 --> 38:05.983

38:05.983 --> 38:06.684
>> WOW.

38:06.684 --> 38:07.885
>> HE HAS BEEN THROWING SO MANY.

38:07.885 --> 38:11.722
>> I AM CONVINCED X HAS THROWN
EVERY COMP HE EVER COMPETED IN

38:11.722 --> 38:13.190
THAT HE LOST.

38:13.190 --> 38:13.824
>> ABSOLUTELY.

38:13.824 --> 38:21.065
>> OH MY GOD, BECAUSE HE-- .

38:21.065 --> 38:23.801
>> IS HE PLAYING SUCH A GOOD
GAME.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.303
>> I AM SO ROOTING FOR HIM TO
WIN.

38:26.303 --> 38:29.674
>> I THINK X-ZAVIER IS PLAYING
AN EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT GAME,

38:29.674 --> 38:33.678
I'M SO IMPRESSED BY THE WAY HE
IS PLAYING THIS LOW THREAT GAME

38:33.678 --> 38:37.381
EVEN THOUGH HE CAN BEAT
EVERYBODY IN EVERY COPETITION

38:37.381 --> 38:38.616
HE WANTS TO.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.484
>> ALYSSA YOU HAVE BEEN ONE OF
MY BEST FRIENDS AND CLOSESTLIES

38:40.484 --> 38:43.788
IN THIS GAME, HAVE I BEEN AS
LOYAL IT TO YOU AS CAN I IN THIS

38:43.788 --> 38:46.490
GAME BUT UNFORTUNATELY I'M
SITTING ON THE BLOCK NEXT TO YOU

38:46.490 --> 38:49.293
SO I HAVE TO USE POV ON MYSELF.

38:49.293 --> 38:51.929
>> WHEN HE SAID I WAS LOYAL TO
YOU AS LONG AS I COULD.

38:51.929 --> 38:53.297
WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT.

38:53.297 --> 38:59.870
>> Julie: BY A VOTE OF 3-1,
ALYSSA, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM THE

38:59.870 --> 39:00.604
BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

39:00.604 --> 39:01.839
>> I GET IT.

39:01.839 --> 39:06.077
>> AND THAT IS WHAT IS CRAZY N
MY GOOD-BYE MESSAGE, YOU KNOW, X

39:06.077 --> 39:08.746
SAID AGAIN, I CAME HERE FOR A
BIGGER PURPOSE.

39:08.746 --> 39:12.249
>> ANYTHING ELSE I HAVE DONE IN
THIS GAME WAS JUST ME FULFILLING

39:12.249 --> 39:15.686
A PLEDGE THAT I MADE.

39:15.686 --> 39:19.924
>> ALYSSA, BEING AS ME AND THE
REMAINING HOUSEGUESTS ARE IN AN

39:19.924 --> 39:22.860
ALLIANCE, I KNEW YOUR PITCHES
WERE IN VEIN AND I WAS TRYING TO

39:22.860 --> 39:25.629
PREPARE YOU FOR THAT REALITY,
YOU SHOULD NEVER FEEL DUMB OR

39:25.629 --> 39:27.732
PLAYED IN ANYWAY FOR NOT
REALIZING WE WERE WORKING

39:27.732 --> 39:29.200
TOGETHER.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.001
>> CHADA WAS LIKE I KNOW YOU DID
NOT SEE THIS COMING.

39:31.001 --> 39:34.572
>> IT IS HOPED THAT YOU WILL
UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE

39:34.572 --> 39:37.742
REASON AS TO WHY I FELT
COMPELLED TO DO THAT.

39:37.742 --> 39:41.712
>> I WISH SHE JUST WOULD HAVE
SAID SOMETHING, HONESTLY,-- I

39:41.712 --> 39:45.416
REALLY DO WANT TO SEE CHADA IN
THE FINAL TWO BECAUSE I FEEL

39:45.416 --> 39:46.951
LIKE PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATE HER.

39:46.951 --> 39:50.755
>> THE SIXTH PERSON ALLIANCE
LEFT IN THE GAME, BRILLIANT,

39:50.755 --> 39:54.391
KUDOS TO THEM, I THINK IT IS
GENIUS BEING A FAN OF THIS SHOW.

39:54.391 --> 39:58.062
I LOVE HOW STUPID I FEEL BECAUSE
I DID NOT SEE IT DOMING.

39:58.062 --> 40:01.031
LIKE I GENUINELY LOVE IT, THEY
PLAYED EVERYONE.

40:01.031 --> 40:04.235
THEY SEEM LIKE THEY DID NOT LIKE
EACH OTHER IN THE HOUSE.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.138
AND I THINK ITS, I COME TO
REALIZE THAT THEY WERE PLAYING

40:07.138 --> 40:10.541
FOR MORE THAN JUST WINNING THIS
GAME AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED

40:10.541 --> 40:11.842
TOGETHER AND I HUNDRED PERCENT
RESPECT IT.

40:11.842 --> 40:14.812
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS
BUT I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE WHO

40:14.812 --> 40:15.913
COMES THROUGH THAT DOOR NEXT.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.516
THE GAME HAS OFFICIALLY BEGUN.

40:18.516 --> 40:21.685
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT Y'ALL, I'M
HOT.

40:21.685 --> 40:22.319
>> YEAH, YOU ARE.

40:22.319 --> 40:26.090

40:26.857 --> 40:30.661

POOL.

40:30.661 --> 40:33.364
>> Julie: UP NEXT, THE FIRST
MEMBER OF THE COOKOUT ALLIANCE

40:33.364 --> 40:37.201

ANOTHER ONE WILL BE TOO.

41:05.529 --> 41:09.066

EVICTION.

41:09.066 --> 41:11.869
TIFFANY, HANNAH, IN MOMENTS THE

VOTES TO HE VICMENT BUT BEFORE
THEY DO YOU EACH HAVE A FINAL

41:14.805 --> 41:18.042
CHANCE TO SWAY THEIR VOTE WITH
ONE BRIEF STATEMENT.

41:18.042 --> 41:24.081
TIFFANY, YOU'RE FIRST.

41:24.081 --> 41:27.885

41:54.578 --> 41:59.750
AND BIG D, I THINK THEY GOT YOU
CAST AS A JOKER.

41:59.750 --> 42:03.554

THIS GAME BUT I AM SURE OF ONE

42:19.503 --> 42:21.105
THING, IT WILL BE ONE OF YOU.

46:04.761 --> 46:07.464
>> WELL, KYLAND AND HI A FINAL
TWO.

46:07.464 --> 46:08.665
WEEK TWO.

46:08.665 --> 46:11.902
AND I WAIVERRED BACK AND FORTH
WITH MY TRUST THAT I HAD IN IN

46:11.902 --> 46:13.036
HIM.

46:13.036 --> 46:17.641
I DOUBTED HIM BUT I STILL
CONTINUED TO INCLUDE HIM IN MY

46:17.641 --> 46:18.909
FINAL PLAN TO THE END.

46:18.909 --> 46:23.447
BUT I DEVELOPED A GREAT
FRIENDSHIP WITH CHADA AND I JUST

46:23.447 --> 46:25.782
REALLY WANTED TO SEE HER AND I
GET TO THE END AS WELL.

46:25.782 --> 46:29.753

MOMENT IN THE H.O.H. WHERE

46:29.753 --> 46:34.424
KYLAND WAS SUPPOSED TO WIN AND

46:40.564 --> 46:42.566
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE UPSET ABOUT
THAT MOMENT.

46:42.566 --> 46:46.203
I DON'T THINK IT IS NECESSARILY
THAT I WON.

46:46.203 --> 46:47.704
I THINK IT IS HOW I WON.

46:47.704 --> 46:52.342
I THINK THAT HAD I EXPRESSED TO
THE COOKOUT PREVIOUS, PRIOR TO

46:52.342 --> 46:56.713
THE COMPETITION THAT I ALSO HAD
A DESIRE TO WIN H.O.H. TWICE IN

46:56.713 --> 47:00.450
A ROW IF I COULD, THAT THEY
WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD MORE SO MY

47:00.450 --> 47:01.418
DESIRE TO WIN THAT COMPETITION.

47:01.418 --> 47:04.388
>> Julie: SO WHY DIDN'T YOU?

47:04.388 --> 47:06.657
>> BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEY DID
NOT WANT ME TO WIN THAT

47:06.657 --> 47:07.858
COMPETITION.

47:07.858 --> 47:09.526
>> Julie: SO YOU THOUGHT THIS
IS GOING TO FALL ON DEAF EARS

47:09.526 --> 47:11.595
MAYBE I WILL GO INTO BUSINESS
FOR MYSELF.

47:11.595 --> 47:15.165
>> I WOULD RATHER ASK FOR
FORGIVENESS THAN ASK FOR

47:15.165 --> 47:15.832
PERMISSION.

47:15.832 --> 47:16.767
>> Julie: WELL SAID, EXACTLY.

47:16.767 --> 47:17.801
SO ANY REGRETS.

47:17.801 --> 47:19.102
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY REGRETS.

47:19.102 --> 47:20.337
I PLAYED THIS GAME.

47:20.337 --> 47:23.240
I WAS READY TO PLAY THIS GAME
THE MOMENT I WALKED IN THE DOOR.

47:23.240 --> 47:26.843
YOU ASKED ME OUT HERE DAY ONE
WHO IS A RISK-TAKER.

47:26.843 --> 47:29.780
ME, SO I AM DEFINITELY A
RISK-TAKER.

47:29.780 --> 47:33.984
I WENT IN, I WANTED TO PLAY BIG
BROTHER BUT WHEN I GOT IN I HAD

47:33.984 --> 47:36.086
TO TONE IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
BECAUSE WE HAD A MISSION.

47:36.086 --> 47:37.588
BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN READY TO
PLAY.

47:37.588 --> 47:41.391
>> Julie: LET'S FACE IT, YOU
WERE THE MASTER MIND BEHIND, ALL

47:41.391 --> 47:45.329
RIGHT, IT'S US SIX IN THE
COOKOUT.

47:45.329 --> 47:48.465
EVERYONE TO BIG D WILL HAVE A
SIDE ALLIANCE, WERE YOU THE

47:48.465 --> 47:49.533
MASTER STRATEGIST.

47:49.533 --> 47:50.634
>> I DID.

47:50.634 --> 47:51.835
>> Julie: SO WHY DO YOU
THINK-- ARE YOU AT ALL MAD THE

47:51.835 --> 47:54.738
FACT THAT YOU KIND OF CAME UP
WITH THIS BIG THING TO GET TO

47:54.738 --> 47:56.506
THE END AND YOU ARE THE FIRST
ONE OUT?

47:56.506 --> 47:59.643
>> IT IS ALMOST, IT IS VERY-- IT
HURTSES.

47:59.643 --> 48:01.979
IT DID HURT MY FEELINGS.

48:01.979 --> 48:05.048
I'M A LITTLE UPSET ABOUT IT BUT
I UNDERSTAND.

48:05.048 --> 48:09.853
I THINK THAT THEY PROBABLY VIEW
THE THREAT OF ME AS BEING ABLE

48:09.853 --> 48:14.157
TO STRATEGIZE AND NOT JUST BEING
ABLE TO STRATEGIZE BUT THEY

48:14.157 --> 48:15.425
CAN'T CONTROL ME.

48:15.425 --> 48:18.662
AND SO THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT
CONTROL ME MAKES ME A LIABILITY

48:18.662 --> 48:21.164
TO EVERYONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE.

48:21.164 --> 48:22.332
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.

48:22.332 --> 48:23.600
I AM NOT EASILY CONTROLLED.

48:23.600 --> 48:27.537
AND SO YOU KNOW, THEY HAD TO DO,
THEY HAD TO GET ME OUT.

48:27.537 --> 48:31.508
>> Julie: HOW HARD WAS IT TO
BALANCE BETWEEN PLAYING TO WIN

48:31.508 --> 48:34.578
FOR YOURSELF, LIFE CHANGING
MONEY, THREE QUARTERS OF A

48:34.578 --> 48:35.479
MILLION DOLLARS.

48:35.479 --> 48:36.680
>> YEAH.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.582
>> Julie: YOU ARE A MOM, YOU
HAVE A 13 YEAR OLD SON AT HOME.

48:38.582 --> 48:39.716
>> I DO.

48:39.716 --> 48:42.486
>> Julie: AND TRYING TO
ACCOMPLISH ON THE OTHER HAND THE

48:42.486 --> 48:45.188
MISSION FOR THE COOKOUT FOR ALL
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, FOR ALL

48:45.188 --> 48:46.690
PEOPLE OF COLOR, REALLY.

48:46.690 --> 48:50.127
>> IT WAS ALWAYS DESIRED IN MY
HEART FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD AND

48:50.127 --> 48:51.495
DO THIS.

48:51.495 --> 48:55.299
HOWEVER I DID NOT KNOW, LIKE
AZAH SAID, IF WE COULD ALWAYS

48:55.299 --> 48:56.533
TRUST EVERYONE'S MOVES.

48:56.533 --> 49:01.905
I ACTUALLY BECAME A PERSON THAT
THEY QUESTIONED MY MOVE WHEN I

49:01.905 --> 49:04.875
WON BB NOTES, HOWEVER I DID
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID I WOULD DO

49:04.875 --> 49:08.679
IF I NEEDED TO DO IT, WHICH WAS
I HAD TO PUT MY OWN PERSON,

49:08.679 --> 49:10.981
CLAIRE, ON THE BLOCK AND SEND
HER HOME.

49:10.981 --> 49:14.918
SO IT WAS VERY TOUGH BECAUSE I
KEPT THINKING, WHICH WAS HOW I

49:14.918 --> 49:16.253
CAME UP WITH THE MASTER PLAN.

49:16.253 --> 49:18.722
I KEPT THINKING HOW ARE WE EVEN
GOING TO GET TO THE SIX.

49:18.722 --> 49:21.591
WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO GET TO
THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WHAT IF I AM

49:21.591 --> 49:23.493
JUST GETTING RID OF PEOPLE THAT
I WANT TO WORK WITH OR LYING TO

49:23.493 --> 49:26.330
PEOPLE THAT I WANT TO WORK WITH
THAT THE SICK ENDS UP NOT EVEN

49:26.330 --> 49:29.900
MAKING IT AND I COULD HAVE KEPT
MY PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING WITH

49:29.900 --> 49:30.801
ME AROUND.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.136
I KNEW I COULD NOT OPERATE
WITHOUT A PLAN.

49:33.136 --> 49:38.275
I WAS VERY-- I STRUGGLED THAT
NIGHT WITH DO I GIVE UP ON THE

49:38.275 --> 49:42.346
SIX OR DO I TRY TO FIGURE OUT
HOW WE CAN MAKE IT I WENT TO BED

49:42.346 --> 49:43.480
THAT NIGHT.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.316
I GOT UP THE NEXT DAY, MONEY
CAN'T BUY YOU LOVE WAS IN MY

49:46.316 --> 49:47.417
HEAD.

49:47.417 --> 49:49.519
I KNEW I NEEDED TO FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT AND I SAT DOWN

49:49.519 --> 49:52.556
WITH THE CHESS BOARD AND PUT
THOSE PIECES TOGETHER AS I HAVE

49:52.556 --> 49:54.224
DONE SINCE THE MOMENT I GOT
HERE.

49:54.224 --> 49:56.159
BECAUSE I NEED TO VISUALLY SEE.

49:56.159 --> 49:58.595
AND IT CAME TO ME IN FIVE
MINUTES.

49:58.595 --> 50:01.298
AND I WAS LIKE THIS IS IT.

50:01.298 --> 50:04.201
>> Julie: YOU ARE JURY NUMBER
SIX, YOU KNOW WE NEED NINE

50:04.201 --> 50:06.536
PEOPLE ON THE JURY, DO YOU THINK
WE COULD KICK OUT A SECOND

50:06.536 --> 50:07.471

50:07.471 --> 50:11.475
>> JULIE, WHAT?

WHAT?

50:11.975 --> 50:12.743
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT.

50:12.743 --> 50:14.811
>> DO I NEED TO USHER HER OFF
NOW?

50:14.811 --> 50:17.647
>> YES, WE DO, BECAUSE YOU ARE A
JURY, SO PLEASE STEP TO THE EDGE

50:17.647 --> 50:21.184
OF THE STAGE WHERE YOU SEE.

50:21.184 --> 50:23.320

50:23.320 --> 50:27.124
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT.

50:27.124 --> 50:29.659
HOUSEGUESTS, I NEED EVERYONE TO

1:19:44.412 --> 1:19:45.580
>> BATHROOM, KY?

1:19:45.580 --> 1:19:56.124
>> SURE.

1:19:56.124 --> 1:19:59.961
>> Julie: HANNAH CHADDHA,
HANNAH CHADDHA.

1:19:59.961 --> 1:20:01.196
>> HANNAH CHADDHA.

1:20:01.196 --> 1:20:04.599
>> Julie: WHEN AZAH NOMINATED
YOU-- WHEN SHE TOLD YOU SHE WAS

1:20:04.599 --> 1:20:07.636
GOING TO PUT YOU AND XAVIER ON
THE BLOCK, YOUR FACE DROPPED.

1:20:07.636 --> 1:20:08.069
>> YES.

1:20:08.069 --> 1:20:09.771
>> Julie: WHY?

1:20:09.771 --> 1:20:15.610
>> MY FACE DROPPED BECAUSE I
THOUGHT THAT AZAH'S TARGET WOULD

1:20:15.610 --> 1:20:16.778
HAVE BEEN KY.

1:20:16.778 --> 1:20:21.082
SHE'S BEEN PRETTY VOCAL ABOUT
COMING AFTER KY FOR PAST FEW

1:20:21.082 --> 1:20:24.286
WEEKS, OR AT LEAST WHEN WE GOT
TO THE POINT OF FINAL SIX, WHEN

1:20:24.286 --> 1:20:26.121
WE COULD START TURNING ON EACH
OTHER.

1:20:26.121 --> 1:20:30.692
SO I WAS SHOCKED THAT SHE DIDN'T
INITIALLY PUT KY ON THE BLOCK.

1:20:30.692 --> 1:20:36.398
AND I THOUGHT HER AND XAVIER
MAYBE SOME SOME SORT OF DEAL IN

1:20:36.398 --> 1:20:39.834
PLACE TO WHERE XAVIER WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN PUT ON THE BLOCK BY

1:20:39.834 --> 1:20:40.402
HER.

1:20:40.402 --> 1:20:42.237
AND THEN,SH, THERE'S ME.

1:20:42.237 --> 1:20:45.941
I THINK THAT FOR HER OWN GAME,
AZAH SHOULD HAVE KEPT ME.

1:20:45.941 --> 1:20:48.577
I DO STILL BELIEVE THAT THE GUYS
ARE WORKING TOGETHER, EVEN IF

1:20:48.577 --> 1:20:51.546
THEY DON'T HAVE A FINAL THREE.

1:20:51.546 --> 1:20:54.149
I THINK THEY'VE MAYBE MADE AN
AGREEMENT TO PROTECT EACH OTHER

1:20:54.149 --> 1:20:56.952
AND LOOK OUT FOR EACH ENERGY
THIS GAME.

1:20:56.952 --> 1:20:59.321
SO FOR AZAH'S PERSONAL GAME, I
BELIEVE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE

1:20:59.321 --> 1:21:00.422
KEPT ME.

1:21:00.422 --> 1:21:05.427
>> Julie: SHE TOLD YOU--
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG-- HER

1:21:05.427 --> 1:21:08.063
TARGET WAS XAVIER, AND EITHER
KYLAND OR XAVIER WAS GOING TO

1:21:08.063 --> 1:21:08.563
GO.

1:21:08.563 --> 1:21:09.598
DO YOU BELIEVE HER?

1:21:09.598 --> 1:21:12.667
OR DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WERE
PERHAPS HER TARGET?

1:21:12.667 --> 1:21:15.337
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I WAS
AZAH'S TARGET.

1:21:15.337 --> 1:21:21.409
I DON'T REALLY SEE HER HAVING A
FINAL FOUR DEAL WITH KYLAND.

1:21:21.409 --> 1:21:24.312
HOWEVER, I DON'T THINK SHE WAS
AWARE THAT KYLAND WAS GOING TO

1:21:24.312 --> 1:21:27.882
USE THE VETO ON XAVIER, WHICH I
KNEW, BECAUSE KYLAND EXPRESSED

1:21:27.882 --> 1:21:34.222
TO ME HOW HE WANTED TO GO TO THE
END WITH STRONG COMPETITORS--

1:21:34.222 --> 1:21:37.359
A.K.A. XAVIER, BECAUSE I GUESS
I'M NOT WORTHY, IN HIS EYES.

1:21:37.359 --> 1:21:41.229
SO IF I WERE H.O.H., I WOULDN'T
HAVE PUT XAVIER ON THE BLOCK.

1:21:41.229 --> 1:21:44.866
I WOULD HAVE PUT KYLAND ON THE
BLOCK TO ENSURE THE VETO WASN'T

1:21:44.866 --> 1:21:47.068
USED BY SOMEONE WHO WASN'T ON
THE BLOCK.

1:21:47.068 --> 1:21:48.169
AZAH APPARENTLY DIDN'T KNOW
THAT.

1:21:48.169 --> 1:21:52.207
MAYBE I WAS HER TARGET.

1:21:52.207 --> 1:21:52.674
MAYBE I WASN'T.

1:21:52.674 --> 1:21:53.875
I DON'T KNOW.

1:21:53.875 --> 1:21:55.810
>> Julie: YOU MENTIONED THIS
WEEK WITHOUT TIFFANY IN THE GAME

1:21:55.810 --> 1:21:58.079
YOU DIDN'T SEE A PATH FOR YOU TO
THE END.

1:21:58.079 --> 1:21:58.647
>> UH-HUH.

1:21:58.647 --> 1:22:00.048
>> Julie: WHY, WHY NOT?

1:22:00.048 --> 1:22:01.816
>> WELL, HERE WE GO.

1:22:01.816 --> 1:22:02.984
HERE WE ARE.

1:22:02.984 --> 1:22:05.553
THAT'S HOW I FELT INITIALLY,
JUST BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PLAYING

1:22:05.553 --> 1:22:08.056
THIS GAME VERY CLOSELY WITH
TIFFANY SINCE WEEK ONE.

1:22:08.056 --> 1:22:14.996
BUT ONCE I, YOU KNOW, DISCOVERED
THAT I WOULD BE ON MY OWN, MY

1:22:14.996 --> 1:22:17.832
FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT RESPONSE KICKED
IN, AND I HAD TO TRY TO FIGURE

1:22:17.832 --> 1:22:21.436
OUT A PATH, WHETHER THAT BE
MAKING DEALS WITH KY, XAVIER,

1:22:21.436 --> 1:22:25.607
DIG "B," AND AZAH.

1:22:25.607 --> 1:22:28.476
I TRIELD PROPOSING A DEAL TO
EACH OF THOSE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO

1:22:28.476 --> 1:22:32.047
PROTECT MYSELF IN THIS GAME AND
ENSURE MY LONGEVITY IN THIS

1:22:32.047 --> 1:22:33.281
GAME.

1:22:33.281 --> 1:22:36.651
BUT AZAH DIDN'T KNOW THAT KY WAS
GOING TO USE THE VETO ON "X,"

1:22:36.651 --> 1:22:37.285
AND HERE WE ARE.

1:22:37.285 --> 1:22:38.119
I WAS COLLATERAL, I BELIEVE.

1:22:38.119 --> 1:22:39.688
>> Julie: HOW HARD WAS IT?

1:22:39.688 --> 1:22:43.658
WAS IT HARD TO STRADDLE THE
FENCE BETWEEN, "LISTEN, I WANT

1:22:43.658 --> 1:22:44.926
TO GET TO THE END.

1:22:44.926 --> 1:22:50.632
I WANT TO WIN THE $750,000," AND
TRYING TO ADVANCE THE COOKOUT AS

1:22:50.632 --> 1:22:52.834
A WHOLE, SIX MEMBERS?

1:22:52.834 --> 1:22:56.538
>> UM, FOR ME, THERE WERE
MOMENTS THAT WERE CHALLENGING,

1:22:56.538 --> 1:23:07.515
SUPSUPSUCH AS ME HAVING A HAND I
SENDING DEREX "X" HOME AND

1:23:07.515 --> 1:23:08.683
SENDING CLAIRE HOME.

1:23:08.683 --> 1:23:13.121
HOWEVER, FOR ME, THERE WERE NO
IFS, ANDS, OR BUTS ABOUT IT.

1:23:13.121 --> 1:23:16.958
THE COOKOUT ALWAYS CAME FIRST,
AND EVEN THOUGH I AM SITTING OUT

1:23:16.958 --> 1:23:21.830
HERE AND I CAME IN FIFTH PLACE
THIS SEASON I FEEL LIKE A

1:23:21.830 --> 1:23:23.098
WINNER.

1:23:23.098 --> 1:23:25.133
I'M PROUD TO SAID BECAUSE OF ME
AND FIVE OTHER PEOPLE THERE WILL

1:23:25.133 --> 1:23:26.534
BE A BLACK WINNER IN THE U.S.

1:23:26.534 --> 1:23:27.802
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY.

1:23:27.802 --> 1:23:31.373
>> Julie: WAS THAT THE BEST
PART GAME FOR YOU?

1:23:31.373 --> 1:23:33.241
I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN
YOUR MOUTH.

1:23:33.241 --> 1:23:35.810
WHAT WAS THE BEST PART OF
PLAYING BUGFOR YOU THIS SEASON?

1:23:35.810 --> 1:23:42.217
>> I CAME IN SAYING I WANTED TO
PLAY A RUTHLESS GAME FILLED WITH

1:23:42.217 --> 1:23:44.052
BLINDSIDES, BACKSTABS AND
BETRAYALS.

1:23:44.052 --> 1:23:48.423
BUT ALAS, I WALKED IN AND SAW
FIVE OTHER FACES SIMILAR TO MINE

1:23:48.423 --> 1:23:49.824
AND THAT CHANGED IMMEDIATELY.

1:23:49.824 --> 1:23:53.461
SO THE BEST PART OF ME PLAYING
"BIG BROTHER" WAS LAST WEEK WHEN

1:23:53.461 --> 1:23:56.564
WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE COOKOUT
TO FINAL SIX.

1:23:56.564 --> 1:23:58.233
>> Julie: YOU ARE A MEMBER OF
THE JURY.

1:23:58.233 --> 1:24:01.035
WE NEED NINE MEMBERS.

1:24:01.035 --> 1:24:04.839
AND ON WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29,
THE NINE OF YOU WILL VOTE FOR A

1:24:04.839 --> 1:24:05.607
WINNER OF "BIG BROTHER."

1:24:05.607 --> 1:24:06.241
STAY RIGHT THERE.

1:24:06.241 --> 1:24:08.343
I GOTTA GET US OFF THE AIR.

1:24:08.343 --> 1:24:09.978
THEY'RE SCREAMING AT ME IN MY
EAR.

1:24:09.978 --> 1:24:11.146
>> ALL RIGHT.

1:24:11.146 --> 1:24:13.047
>> Julie: WITH THAT OUR SECOND
DOUBLE EVICTION NIGHT OF THE

1:24:13.047 --> 1:24:15.650
SUMMER COMES TO AN END AND THE
FINAL FOUR ARE IN PLACE.

1:24:15.650 --> 1:24:19.187
AND SINCE CBS WILL BE AIRING THE
EMMY AWARDS ON SUNDAY NIGHT,

1:24:19.187 --> 1:24:24.292
WE'LL BE AIRING A SPECIAL NIGHT,
TOMORROW NIGHT, FRIDAY, AT 8:00,

1:24:24.292 --> 1:24:25.560
7:00 CENTRAL.

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:28.129
TUNE IN TO SEE WHO RISES TO
POWER AS THE NEW HEAD OF

1:24:28.129 --> 1:24:31.232
HOUSEHOLD AND SEE WHO THAT
PERSON NOMINATES FOR EVICTION.

1:24:31.232 --> 1:24:34.235
THEN ON WEDNESDAY, IT'S THE
FINAL POWER OF VETO COMPETITION

1:24:34.235 --> 1:24:35.437
OF THE SUMMER.

1:24:35.437 --> 1:24:37.238
AND ON THURSDAY WE WILL SEND
ANOTHER HOUSEGUEST TO THE JURY,

1:24:37.238 --> 1:24:41.576
LEAVING THE THREE FINALISTS TO
BATTLE IT OUT LIVE ON FINALE

1:24:41.576 --> 1:24:43.912
NIGHT TO BECOME THE GRAND PRIZE
WINNER OF "BIG BROTHER."

1:24:43.912 --> 1:24:46.614
FOR NOW, LET'S EAVESDROP ON THE
FINAL FOUR.

1:24:46.614 --> 1:24:52.020
FROM OUTSIDE THE "BIG BROTHER"
HOUSE WITH HANNAH CHADDHA, I'M

1:24:52.020 --> 1:24:52.754
JULIE CHEN MOONVES.

1:24:52.754 --> 1:24:55.390
PLEASE LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

1:24:55.390 --> 1:24:56.024
GOOD NIGHT.
