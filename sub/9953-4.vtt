WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.453
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.794 --> 00:04.659
What's wrong?
(Nathan): I can feel you.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.703
- How long have you known?
- A while.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.793
- The Hunter, it's a meteor storm.

00:08.967 --> 00:12.551
It comes every 27 years,
and when it does, I disappear.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.221
No, Nathan, it's coming in 46 days.

00:16.391 --> 00:19.133
- Easy with the triggers people, I'm a cop.
(Nathan): What led you to Haven?

00:19.311 --> 00:21.677
- I talked to the local chief.
I'm gonna accept his job offer.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.767
Hey, I'd rather be in the sticks
than a body bag.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.432
- You pushed him away on purpose.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.022
- Nathan would never have stopped
trying to save me.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.436
- And you're trying
to protect him.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.651
- You didn't need me to help find him.
You needed me to kill him.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.114
- Duke...

00:38.288 --> 00:39.744
what happened back there?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.163
What caused that?

00:42.334 --> 00:44.370
- Bolt gun.
Normally used to put down livestock.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.082
- An identical wound.
What... who's that?

00:47.256 --> 00:48.371
- Roslyn.
- Roslyn?

00:48.549 --> 00:52.041
- Whoever abducted you is doing this.
- He's still here.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.017
- And then he scalped her.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.648
- Uh-huh.
(overlapping murmuring)

01:09.611 --> 01:10.691
Killed with a bolt gun.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.727
- Think one of your Troubley people did this?

01:12.906 --> 01:15.283
- Back of the head.
Just like the other two.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.827
(chatter on police radio)

01:19.454 --> 01:21.319
- This isn't a Troubled person.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.661
Three women,
all killed the same way.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.578
Haven's got itself its first serial killer.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.789
- First the nose, now a scalp.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.628
Taking trophies.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.793
- l was surprised you changed your mind
about joining up.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.552
You're not already regretting it, are ya?

01:37.723 --> 01:41.090
- Kidding me? This crazy stuff
is exactly why I stayed. Heh.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.141
You got something here?

01:44.313 --> 01:45.473
- Yeah, maybe.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.316
(laughs nervously)

01:52.487 --> 01:54.478
- Good thing our killer's ink
is in a different place,

01:54.656 --> 01:56.863
otherwise you'd have
some explaining to do.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.869
What's the symbol mean, anyway?

02:00.037 --> 02:01.618
- It's a townie thing.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.699
Can you take point on this?

02:03.874 --> 02:05.239
- You want me to hold
the scene down for Audrey?

02:05.417 --> 02:07.908
- No. Catch her up later.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.203
- Surprised she's not here.
Her day off?

02:11.381 --> 02:13.463
- No days off in Haven.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.974
- Think back.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.511
It's 1983.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.304
You're Lucy.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.145
You're on the beach
with this necklace.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.061
You're holding Duke's hand.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.399
- Duke's only eight.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.233
- What do you remember
from that day?

02:42.412 --> 02:43.788
(scoffs)
- This is stupid.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.035
- It's not stupid.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.322
lt's regressive hypnotherapy.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.116
And I blew three days on the web
trying to figure it out.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.704
- I thought you learned this
in medical school.

02:50.879 --> 02:54.337
- You kidding? Yale thinks this past-life
hypnosis stuff is all bull.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.748
- Then why are we doing it?

02:55.926 --> 02:57.917
- Because whether Yale
wants to believe it or not,

02:58.095 --> 02:59.926
you've had a past life.
Several, actually.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.258
And desperate times
require desperate measures.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.684
- It's been three sessions
and I haven't remembered anything.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.512
- Regression is weird.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.928
You never know
what is gonna trigger a memory.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.563
We kind ofjust got to wait.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.019
- I don't have time to wait.
- Do you want to talk about that?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.560
- No.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.319
There's nothing to talk about.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.981
- How are things between you and Nathan
after your talk?

03:21.159 --> 03:22.740
Does he know why you pushed him away?

03:22.911 --> 03:23.946
- No.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.370
But it's better that way.

03:27.541 --> 03:31.409
Until I find out more about what happened
to the Colorado Kid...

03:32.754 --> 03:34.665
Nathan's safer.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.000
- And Duke?

03:36.967 --> 03:39.333
How are things between the two of you
after what happened?

03:39.511 --> 03:41.297
- Harry Nix was a monster
who was Troubled,

03:41.471 --> 03:43.052
and he would have killed
hundreds of people.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.555
- It doesn't mean it was an easy decision
to kill him.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.139
- Listen, I know what I asked Duke to do
wasn't fair.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.348
But I did what I had to do.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.138
And I did what I could do.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.192
I am running out of time, Claire, okay?

03:57.362 --> 03:59.478
In a little over a month,
| disappear.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.113
And there are still so many people
that I need to help.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.570
- You're only one person, Audrey.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.281
You can't save everyone.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.537
- But I have to try.

04:13.462 --> 04:14.827
- You can do it, Frank.
Jump to me.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.041
- You're too far.
- The water won't be over your head.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.421
There's nothing to be afraid of.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.002
- I'm going to drown.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.418
- You're not going to drown,
I promise.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.253
- Mm-mm.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.093
- For crying out loud, Frank.
A three-year-old can learn to swim.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.427
What are you so afraid of?

04:30.645 --> 04:31.680
- Alice?

04:34.941 --> 04:36.272
Alice?

04:40.989 --> 04:42.945
(screaming)

04:45.035 --> 04:48.152
(theme music)

05:21.279 --> 05:22.985
- Whatever did this is big.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.067
- Yeah, so where the hell did it go?

05:25.242 --> 05:28.075
- I'd like to know how it got in the pool
in the first place.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.610
l swim laps here in the morning.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.492
At least I used to.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.076
- My wife said I had to learn to swim.

05:37.254 --> 05:40.917
Said it was dangerous I couldn't,
in a town surrounded by water.

05:41.758 --> 05:42.964
More dangerous than this?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.386
- And you're sure you didn't see
what attacked your teacher?

05:45.554 --> 05:46.919
- Piranhas.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.383
The Loch Ness Monster.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.925
- Frank, have you ever had anything like this
happen to you near the water?

05:53.103 --> 05:54.343
- What do you mean?

05:54.521 --> 05:59.140
- Does anyone in your family have...
issues with water?

05:59.317 --> 06:01.433
- My mother and father are sailors.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.818
They love the water.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.025
- Okay, so what can you tell me
about your teacher?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.609
- Not much.
She wasn't my regular teacher.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.366
She just took over
when Daphne didn't show.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.628
- What are you doing here?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.380
- Heard there was a monster in the pool.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.216
Thought I'd come check it out,
you know.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.048
Concerned citizen and all.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.302
- Duke...

06:32.058 --> 06:34.174
What are you doing here?
- He was just leaving.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.344
- Just staying.
- This is a police investigation.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.682
You're not a cop.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.472
- Well, you wanted my help last time.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.857
Isn't that right, Audrey?

06:43.028 --> 06:44.984
- We don't even know
that it's a Trouble.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.606
- Yeah, we do.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.154
- He just shows up,
thinks he can do what he wants?

06:55.332 --> 06:57.573
He just killed a guy.
- Only because I asked him to.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.241
- Are you sure about that?

07:01.713 --> 07:05.001
When he transforms, he gets a rush.
You've seen it yourself.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.961
- He didn't ask
for what happened to him.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.968
- That doesn't mean
he's not gonna learn to like it.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.769
(man): Hey, Frank.
See you in there, all right?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.311
- Mm-hmm.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.156
- Monster?
- Pool?

07:35.330 --> 07:37.446
- Never mind.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.909
What's up?

07:39.084 --> 07:41.666
- We came by the ATM this morning,

07:41.836 --> 07:44.213
but Detective Bowen
wouldn't tell us what happened.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.962
- Well, finally,
someone who knows

07:46.132 --> 07:48.384
what police investigation
actually means.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.509
- The killer who abducted Audrey...

07:51.680 --> 07:53.511
He murdered another woman,
didn't he?

07:53.682 --> 07:55.047
- What did he cut off this time?

07:55.225 --> 07:57.637
- I think I'm gonna follow Tommy's lead
on this one.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.676
- We just want to help.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.857
- Okay.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.992
Tell me about the tattooed people.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.899
- You think they had something to do
with the killings?

08:15.078 --> 08:18.411
- The days of one-way information flow
are over.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.833
You want to get,
you're gonna have to give.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.753
- They've been in Haven for generations.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.840
Call themselves the Guard.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.923
- They refuse to let the Troubled
be victimized.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.679
- And they won't hesitate to kill
to protect them.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.841
- How do | contact them?

08:39.019 --> 08:42.136
- Ah... It's not like they have a clubhouse.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.734
- One of them works at the Gun & Rose.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.815
Lunch shift.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.857
Look for Jordan.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.526
- Now how hard was that?

08:59.622 --> 09:02.364
(Dave): Mm-hmm. Your turn, Nathan.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.784
- The serial killer...

09:05.962 --> 09:07.827
has the tattoo.

09:08.006 --> 09:08.995
- How do you know?

09:09.174 --> 09:10.505
- Nope, that's all you get.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.718
(clears throat)

09:19.893 --> 09:22.384
Uh, leave it alone.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.474
I'm serious.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.775
- This changes everything.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.027
- Yeah, well,
we don't have all the facts.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.813
- And how are we gonna get them?

09:34.991 --> 09:37.528
Nathan isn't gonna tell us.
He doesn't trust us anymore.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.827
- Detective Bowen's doing
quite a bit of work on the case.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.988
- Why would he help us?

09:43.166 --> 09:45.157
- Maybe he won't have a choice.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.417
(laughter)

09:49.589 --> 09:51.750
- Frank came to see me
a couple months ago.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.837
Most extreme case of hydrophobia
I've ever seen.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.797
- Is he Troubled?

09:57.722 --> 09:58.962
- It never came up.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.131
I did all I could for him
on dry land,

10:01.309 --> 10:03.345
then I sent him
to Daphne at the swim center.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.557
She has a way with the...
scaredy-cats.

10:06.731 --> 10:10.565
Oh, and you left this at my place.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.521
I didn't want you to think you lost it.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.276
(gasps softly)

10:29.879 --> 10:31.744
Audrey?
(phone ringing)

10:35.802 --> 10:37.918
Audrey, can you hear me?
- What?

10:38.096 --> 10:39.836
- You totally zoned out.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.424
You could have had
a small seizure.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.055
- No, I remembered.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.471
That day on the beach,
I actually remembered it.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.886
- That's great.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.851
- l was Lucy.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.896
I could feel being Lucy.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.812
That's never happened
to me before.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.825
- Okay, Aud, gotta go.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.327
Hey, Nathan.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.079
- Claire.

11:12.547 --> 11:15.880
- A tooth.
- From a Porbeagle shark.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.632
Lucassi dug it out of Alice's leg.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.465
- Attacked by a shark in a pool?
- Mm-hmm.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.379
- It's a Trouble all right.

11:23.558 --> 11:27.016
- Does Claire think Frank's Troubled?
- She's not sure.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.428
But she did say
he's just gotten out of the hospital,

11:29.606 --> 11:31.187
so we should talk to him.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.895
- So how's it going with Claire?

11:35.069 --> 11:37.481
- Good, good.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.985
Did you get an ID
on that woman at the ATM?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.240
- Yes.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.323
Mary Smith. 24.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.079
Her, uh, family says
she has no connection to the victims,

11:49.250 --> 11:51.161
and they swear she's not Troubled.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.496
- Who's this tattooed person?

11:52.670 --> 11:54.786
And why is he killing these women?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.498
And why would they abduct me?

11:58.676 --> 12:00.962
- That's exactly what I plan on asking.

12:01.137 --> 12:04.721
I found out they call themselves the Guard.

12:06.309 --> 12:09.847
One of their members works
at the Gun & Rose diner out on route 10.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.353
- And you think they're just gonna
talk to you because you have the tattoo now?

12:12.523 --> 12:14.935
- It's worth a try.
- You don't even know what it means.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.610
- Then I fake my way through it.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.268
- Nathan, it's dangerous, okay?
Would you just...

12:18.446 --> 12:20.562
Please, would you be careful?
(small discharge)

12:22.867 --> 12:25.153
Be careful.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.616
I'm sorry.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.156
- Yeah, me too.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.837
(sighs)
What does he want?

12:42.011 --> 12:43.922
- He said he wanted to be involved.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.509
- Yeah, well,
don't always get what we want.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.049
- You gonna tell him about that other thing?
You gonna tell him about the Guard?

12:49.227 --> 12:50.637
- No, I don't want him
anywhere near that.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.097
- Someone with the tattoo
is gonna kill him one day.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.307
- About time.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.972
The Scooby van was about to leave
without you two.

12:56.985 --> 13:00.773
- Duke, I know what you did saved lives,
but I know you,

13:00.947 --> 13:03.154
and I don't trust
that that'll be the end of it.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.157
- Nathan, I don't think
this is about you not trusting me.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.364
I think you're pissed...

13:09.539 --> 13:11.325
because Audrey does.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.285
(water roars, woman screams)

13:13.459 --> 13:15.541
(shouting in distance)

13:15.712 --> 13:17.043
(tires screech)

13:28.975 --> 13:30.840
- There's someone in there.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.978
Hey, you okay?
(overlapping shouting)

13:35.148 --> 13:36.388
Oh...

13:37.775 --> 13:40.232
(Audrey): Sir, are you okay?

13:53.916 --> 13:56.453
Mr. Harris, are you sure you're okay?

13:56.627 --> 13:59.118
- l was just driving along.
Where did that water come from?

13:59.297 --> 14:01.538
- Looked like a broken water main.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.253
- But the fish?
There are fish in my car!

14:04.427 --> 14:06.258
- Rock cod.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.049
It wasn't a shark.

14:09.223 --> 14:13.182
- Mr. Harris, do you know a Frank Bentley
or an Allison Hargrove?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.763
She teaches at the swim center?

14:14.937 --> 14:16.473
- I don't know either of them.
I hate the water,

14:16.647 --> 14:18.228
and I never go to the swim center.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.185
- Looks like you cut yourself.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.228
- Yeah, you should get that checked out.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.395
- No, it's fine.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.486
Look, | just live around the corner.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.366
| just want to go home,
get out of these wet clothes,

14:31.537 --> 14:33.402
and pretend none of this ever happened.
(cellphone rings)

14:33.581 --> 14:34.787
- That is the Haven way.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.289
(cellphone beeps)
- Parker.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.951
- Do you mind?
- Yeah, well...

14:40.129 --> 14:41.585
- What?
- We'll be there in five.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.292
(cellphone beeps)
Frank.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.798
The guy from the pool.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.293
He's dead.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.300
- We should, uh...
we should get on this.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.597
- I'm gonna kill him.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.884
Mr. Harris,
we'll have the car towed.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.893
But I want you down at the station
as soon as you get cleaned up.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.019
We need to talk more.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.600
- Sure.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.360
(entry bell jingles)

15:07.532 --> 15:09.864
- Detective Bowen,
this is a surprise.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.319
- Yeah, I got a surprise too.

15:11.494 --> 15:15.112
One of the cops from my old precinct called.
Said you guys are checking up on me?

15:15.289 --> 15:17.871
- Oh, just getting some background
for an article.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.910
Lots of people are curious
about our new big city detective.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.624
- In fact, we were hoping
to get an interview.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.880
- Nah. No interviews.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.335
Stay out of my business.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.752
- Well, we were just--
- Are we clear on that?

15:34.016 --> 15:37.179
'Cause | just want to make sure
that we're clear.

15:38.229 --> 15:41.346
- Uh, of course, Detective.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.639
Our apologies.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.559
- Won't happen again, sir.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.819
- That's good.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.651
Thank you.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.446
(entry bell jingles)

16:01.252 --> 16:04.119
(laughter)

16:04.297 --> 16:05.537
- Fantastic.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.252
- You were right.
That is a man with something to hide.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.381
- Something serious.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.924
Pull out every contact you have.
Someone in Boston knows

16:14.098 --> 16:17.807
why our big city detective
is hiding out in Haven.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.857
- Wife found him collapsed
against the wall of the shower,

16:27.028 --> 16:29.064
still on his feet.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.648
- Hit his head somehow?

16:30.823 --> 16:32.939
- But there's no contusions.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.153
And check this out.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.286
His lungs are full of water.

16:40.958 --> 16:44.371
So how does a grown man drown
standing up in the shower?

16:44.545 --> 16:46.206
(door opens)

16:46.380 --> 16:49.998
- Duke and ljust talked to Frank's wife.
She said he definitely wasn't Troubled.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.885
But she did give us some information
about Daphne, the missing swim teacher.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.967
She said that Frank
had been calling her all morning

16:57.141 --> 16:58.301
and wasn't able to reach her.

16:58.476 --> 17:01.513
- Think she's another victim?
- Or she's the one who started it.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.427
- Did you deputize him or something?

17:03.606 --> 17:05.688
- Hey, good idea, buddy.
- Don't call me buddy.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.689
- Hey, we should go over
to Daphne's house, okay?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.270
There might be some clue there
where she's gone.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.231
Maybe she had something
to do with this.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.531
- Stay there.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.362
Fine.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.614
- I can't go if I'm gonna make it
to the Gun & Rose in time.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.498
- Listen, I'll take Duke with me,
all right?

17:24.669 --> 17:26.876
That way I can figure out
why he's following us around.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.379
- I'm guessing he's still pissed
about Harry Nix.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.094
That you didn't trust him enough
to tell him what was going on.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.475
- I am so enjoying how unhappy he is.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.261
- This is Daphne's cellphone number.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.772
First assignment, if you want to be
part of the team, is to call her.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.229
And keep on calling her
until she picks up.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.490
(sighs)

18:02.081 --> 18:04.163
(car engine turns off)

18:11.757 --> 18:13.839
(sighs)

18:14.010 --> 18:17.798
So you're reallyjust following us around
to piss Nathan off?

18:18.723 --> 18:19.883
- Icing on the cake.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.719
- No, I'm serious, Duke.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.885
You...
(sighs)

18:26.063 --> 18:28.349
After what happened, I...

18:29.817 --> 18:32.809
I would have thought you had enough
of the Troubles for a while.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.075
- Looking for Daphne?

18:44.999 --> 18:47.866
- Detective Audrey Parker.
Haven PD.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.748
- I'm just Duke.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.914
- Um, Bob Harmon.
| just live next door.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.003
- Daphne didn't show up
to work today.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.964
- And she's not answering her phone.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.378
- Come to think of it,
I didn't see her car

19:00.556 --> 19:02.592
when I got in last night.
It's a green sedan.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.348
She usuallyjust parks it
in the driveway.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.180
- Does she have a boyfriend,
or anywhere else she might spend the night?

19:07.355 --> 19:08.720
- Not that I know of.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.560
But she did just get a new job
selling pharmaceuticals.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.190
She travels all over the county.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.693
I suppose she could have spent the night
at a hotel,

19:15.863 --> 19:18.570
but, you know,
it's not like her not to keep in touch.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.525
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. It's just...

19:22.703 --> 19:24.443
l'm itchy.
It's like I got something...

19:24.622 --> 19:26.032
(grunts)
...craw|ing all over me.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.243
What the...
Oh, my God!

19:29.043 --> 19:30.453
(grunting)
(Duke): Hey...

19:31.545 --> 19:33.627
- Get 'em off me!
(Audrey): Call 911.

19:33.798 --> 19:34.958
- Get 'em off me!

19:35.132 --> 19:36.121
Help me!

19:36.300 --> 19:39.087
(screams)

19:54.026 --> 19:55.937
- More coffee, Chief?

19:56.112 --> 19:58.398
Or can I talk you into some pie?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.313
- Coffee, thanks, Jordan.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.821
- Maybe just the check.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.371
- Have a seat.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.870
- Am I in some kind of trouble?

20:12.044 --> 20:14.786
- Just looking for some information.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.500
- About what?

20:20.970 --> 20:22.460
Ask yourself.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.048
You've got one too.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.884
Or let me guess.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.801
You got it just to be cool,
and you have no idea what it means.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.435
- I didn't get it to be cool.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.639
- Then why?

20:36.444 --> 20:39.481
- Back when the Rev tried
to divide the town, I...

20:39.655 --> 20:42.567
made me realize
I had to pick a side.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.609
So I got this to show which one I chose.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.572
- Good for you.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.702
We done?

20:48.873 --> 20:50.784
- Your people have a leader?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.164
I want to meet him.

20:52.334 --> 20:56.293
- We don't talk to, uh, outsiders.

20:56.464 --> 20:59.171
- I bust my ass every day,
trying to help the Troubled.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.797
That doesn't count for something?

21:00.968 --> 21:03.334
- Tattoo or not, you're still a cop.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.671
- Are you doing something illegal?

21:08.517 --> 21:11.509
(cellphone rings)

21:17.485 --> 21:18.770
(cellphone beeps)
Hey...

21:20.696 --> 21:21.731
Be right there.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.942
(cellphone beeps)
- Well, it's been fun.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.607
Have a nice life.
- I'd like to talk to you again.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.447
- 'Cause this went so well.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.612
- Your people don't want me
as an enemy.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.826
- My people can handle it.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.911
- You sure about that?

21:37.671 --> 21:39.832
- Place closes at 10.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.747
Come back then if you have to.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.471
(van door shuts, engine revs)

21:59.652 --> 22:00.641
- Hey, boss.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.685
- How's Daphne's neighbour?

22:02.863 --> 22:05.570
- Where you been?
- None of your business.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.151
So what do you got?

22:07.326 --> 22:08.862
- No permanent damage.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.322
We're trying to find a connection
between the victims.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.078
The only thing
that we've come up with

22:13.249 --> 22:15.831
is this mysterious woman Daphne,
the swim teacher.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.616
- But we did put out an APB.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.751
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.662
- Daphne worked with Alice,
Frank was her client,

22:21.841 --> 22:22.956
and Bob was her neighbour.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.749
- But what about the, uh...
the guy with the fish in his car?

22:25.928 --> 22:26.917
- Reed Harris.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.132
- He said he didn't know anyone
at the swim center.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.512
- Maybe he knows her,
but somehow

22:30.683 --> 22:32.219
he just hasn't made the connection.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.975
- Or maybe he just lied.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.476
(cellphone beeps)

22:37.606 --> 22:39.062
- Stan, has Reed Harris come in...

22:39.233 --> 22:40.689
- What?
- ...to give his statement yet?

22:43.529 --> 22:44.769
Harris never came in.
(cellphone beeps)

22:44.947 --> 22:46.562
Stan hasn't been able to reach him.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.231
- All right, so no luck with Daphne.
Let's go after Reed.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.116
- Shotgun!

22:53.622 --> 22:55.578
- I should've put him in a cell.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.205
- Just let him help.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.877
(car door shuts)
We owe him.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.251
- You owe him.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.220
- Bingo.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.975
- Vincent, stop playing computer games.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.807
You're supposed to be looking
for information.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.471
- No, no, no,
I found something.

23:20.649 --> 23:25.143
Tommy has a sealed Internal Affairs jacket
back in Boston.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.687
- What's in it?
- lt's sealed.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.105
- Well, how does that help us?

23:29.283 --> 23:31.899
- Well, whatever it is,
it must be something bad.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.908
Something so bad,

23:34.079 --> 23:36.991
Tommy decided to hide from it
here in Haven.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.873
- Yeah, since no one would want
to live in Haven just because.

23:40.044 --> 23:43.286
- What is in that file
could be exactly what we need

23:43.464 --> 23:48.254
to persuade Detective Bowen
to share information with us.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.213
- You suggesting blackmail?

23:50.387 --> 23:54.551
(chuckles)
- Feels like old times, eh?

23:54.725 --> 23:56.761
- Bingo.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.349
(engine turns off)

24:01.523 --> 24:03.730
- All right. On the case.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.985
Hey, Sherlock and Holmes.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.658
Cellphone.
(Audrey): It's the same pattern.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.456
(weakly): Help!

24:28.175 --> 24:29.881
(Audrey): Over here.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.050
Mr. Harris, can you hear me?

24:32.221 --> 24:34.462
- I need an ambulance
at 147 Berkeley.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.722
Victim's a male
suffering extreme blood loss.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.883
- lt's barely a scrape.
It shouldn't be bleeding that much.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.427
- Careful with that blood.
If he's Troubled,

24:41.605 --> 24:43.846
the last thing we need
is you turning all silver-eyed.

24:44.566 --> 24:48.559
- It's not the Troubles.
lt's karma.

24:49.697 --> 24:52.063
Payback for killing her.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.822
- Killing who?
Who did you kill?

24:53.993 --> 24:55.574
- The car.

24:56.412 --> 24:59.199
I didn't see it,
and it was too late.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.739
l swerved, but...

25:01.917 --> 25:04.408
she went over the edge.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.575
Into the ocean.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.245
I know I should've stayed.

25:08.424 --> 25:10.790
But I was scared.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.380
- Can't wait for that ambulance.
I got a first aid kit in the truck.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.886
- Mr. Harris? Reed?

25:16.056 --> 25:17.762
You need to hang on, okay?

25:17.933 --> 25:19.173
Help is on the way.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.966
Mr. Harris?

25:23.147 --> 25:24.762
Mr. Harris?!

25:28.110 --> 25:29.646
He's gone.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.522
Okay.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.316
Reed hated the water.

25:39.371 --> 25:43.614
Maybe the guilt of him causing this woman
to die in the ocean, maybe that...

25:43.792 --> 25:45.623
maybe that triggered his curse?

25:45.794 --> 25:48.046
(stammers):
No, but that doesn't add up.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.248
What about Daphne?

25:49.423 --> 25:51.789
- Whatever his curse was...

25:51.967 --> 25:53.173
it's over now.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.335
- Maybe it's not Reed.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.299
Maybe it's Daphne.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.805
Maybe it's her car
that went over the cliff.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.762
- Maybe she is the one
who's causing all this.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.934
- Help me, someone!

26:08.108 --> 26:09.484
Help me!

26:11.278 --> 26:13.894
(screams)

26:28.212 --> 26:31.249
(whimpering)

26:32.382 --> 26:34.509
I'm gonna drown!

26:36.303 --> 26:38.760
- I can't breathe.
- Duke, why are you wet?

26:38.931 --> 26:41.843
- Audrey... I think I'm drowning.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.006
- Duke!

26:45.813 --> 26:46.802
Duke! Oh!

26:46.980 --> 26:50.017
(choking)

26:51.693 --> 26:52.853
No, Duke.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.734
No, you're not gonna die on me, okay?

27:08.293 --> 27:10.545
(coughs)

27:15.759 --> 27:18.216
- What happened?
(Duke gasping for breath)

27:25.936 --> 27:27.676
- I think it's Daphne.

27:27.855 --> 27:29.937
I think that she's the one doing this.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.478
Okay. So, if I'm right,
Daphne survived the crash.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.021
She's desperate to be saved,

27:39.199 --> 27:41.531
and so her Trouble is bringing
her worst fears to life.

27:41.702 --> 27:44.569
- So anytime Daphne thinks
about a potential rescuer,

27:44.746 --> 27:46.327
they experience
whatever's happening to her?

27:46.498 --> 27:48.705
- Yeah.
Alice at the swim center.

27:49.543 --> 27:51.204
And Bob was her neighbour.

27:51.378 --> 27:54.620
Both people, she thought,
would notice her missing first.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.881
- And then she must have thought
that Reed would have a change of heart

27:58.051 --> 28:00.713
and tell the police where she was.
- But he didn't.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.753
And he bled out, which...

28:03.599 --> 28:05.965
...must be an injury
that she suffered in the crash.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.304
- I didn't know Daphne.
How'd she target me?

28:08.478 --> 28:11.811
- Maybe one of your calls got through,
and your name came up on the screen.

28:11.982 --> 28:13.643
- That's what I get for helping.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.149
You know, we may want
to ask ourselves...

28:16.320 --> 28:18.982
how many more people have to die
just because she thinks about 'em.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.111
- None. All right?

28:20.282 --> 28:21.488
'Cause we're gonna find her.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.694
So we need to use
what she's projecting as clues.

28:23.869 --> 28:27.032
So we know she's probably
on cliff road.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.618
- There's only four turnouts
without guardrails.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.749
That's... still over a 10-mile stretch.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.535
(Nathan): Most crabs live in wash zones.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.294
- Porbeagle sharks like cold water.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.330
Which means she's near one
of the deeper bays.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.753
Only one of which has a cliff
with a wash zone at its base.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.387
I know where she is.

28:46.308 --> 28:48.515
But we don't have much time
before the tide comes up.

28:48.685 --> 28:49.936
- If I call Fire and Rescue,

28:50.103 --> 28:52.185
I'm putting them right
in the path of Daphne's Trouble.

28:52.356 --> 28:53.812
- We'll get her ourselves.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.689
- I've got some rope in the truck.
- Okay. Let's go.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.691
- Before she takes
another crack at me.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.287
(engine turns off)

29:11.458 --> 29:12.959
(car doors shut)

29:15.170 --> 29:18.412
- This is all the rope I have.
Hope it's enough.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.096
- I can't believe
she could still be alive down there.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.978
- If she is, not for long.
The tide's coming up.

29:36.733 --> 29:39.475
Tie it to the truck.
- Yeah.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.192
- I'll go first.

29:45.367 --> 29:48.200
If she sees me, I'm...
l'm immune.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.867
- Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.785
You okay?

29:58.964 --> 30:00.500
What just happened?

30:03.010 --> 30:04.341
- What's Duke doing?

30:05.304 --> 30:06.965
- He's gonna kill her.
Stop the Trouble.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.346
(gun cocks)
- No. Nathan, don't.

30:09.516 --> 30:12.223
- She's the one in danger.
- No, Nathan, listen.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.134
He's the same Duke
that he was last week.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.554
The same Duke that you've known
your whole entire live.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.063
- Exactly.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.521
- ls someone there?

30:26.825 --> 30:27.780
Help!

30:28.660 --> 30:30.776
Oh, my God! Thank you!

30:30.954 --> 30:33.115
I knew someone
would come and save me.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.952
Hurry.
The rocks are gonna fall.

30:42.591 --> 30:43.671
(rumbling)

30:45.552 --> 30:46.712
- Daphne!
(Daphne screams)

30:46.887 --> 30:48.002
You're doing this!

30:48.180 --> 30:50.296
You're causing the rocks to fall!

30:50.474 --> 30:51.680
You have to stop!

30:55.520 --> 30:56.896
- Hurry!

30:57.564 --> 30:59.520
- She's gonna cause a rockslide!

31:04.738 --> 31:06.194
- Get away from her car!

31:25.550 --> 31:26.630
- He's gonna kill her.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.335
(screaming)

31:32.099 --> 31:33.589
(metal creaking)

31:42.401 --> 31:43.481
- Grab on to me!

32:02.254 --> 32:04.711
(crickets chirping)

32:04.881 --> 32:06.872
(monitor beeps steadily)

32:10.011 --> 32:11.262
- Duke?

32:11.847 --> 32:12.802
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

32:12.973 --> 32:14.509
- Daphne asked me to come by

32:14.683 --> 32:18.141
so she could say thank you,
lguess.

32:19.563 --> 32:20.973
How is she?

32:21.148 --> 32:24.311
- She's wrapping her head
around the fact that she's responsible

32:24.484 --> 32:26.566
for hurting and killing people
she cared about.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.398
- Yeah, it's gonna be
a hard thing to live with.

32:31.366 --> 32:34.073
- I'm gonna... recheck her vitals.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.280
- Hey, I wanted to say thank you.

32:41.334 --> 32:44.292
Thank you for helping us
find Daphne... alive.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.579
We couldn't have done it without you.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.417
- "And thank you for not killing her."

32:48.592 --> 32:52.801
You know I'm gonna...
just assume that's implied.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.135
- Of... course not.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.517
- Nathan can think whatever he wants.
I don't care, but...

33:04.608 --> 33:06.690
...you're the one who asked me
to kill that man,

33:06.860 --> 33:10.523
asked me to do something
that I said I would never do.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.937
- I know.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.857
This is...

33:16.036 --> 33:17.572
It's all my fault.

33:19.748 --> 33:20.908
- No.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.407
That's just it.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.495
It was my decision.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.503
That's why I wanted
to be on this case, Audrey.

33:32.677 --> 33:37.421
To show you that my family's legacy
does not control me.

33:37.599 --> 33:40.011
And neither do you.

33:43.647 --> 33:44.682
- I know.

33:56.743 --> 33:57.858
(sighs)

33:59.746 --> 34:00.781
- Don't even think about it.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.992
- Wouldn't dare.
- Good.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.281
- Uh, but...

34:04.918 --> 34:06.328
Just wondering...

34:06.503 --> 34:07.709
you know, how much of this

34:07.879 --> 34:10.666
was about you worrying
that Audrey sees you differently now.

34:10.840 --> 34:14.253
- I don't worry
about what Audrey thinks of me.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.005
- Just keep telling yourself that.

34:30.652 --> 34:33.064
(rock music)

34:37.367 --> 34:38.732
- Mm.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.196
That's not bad, for a diner.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.120
- Private stock.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.584
18-year single malt.

34:46.751 --> 34:47.911
Straight from Japan.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.919
- Sounds like something
Duke would smuggle in.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.126
(chuckles)
- We don't associate with Crocker.

34:54.301 --> 34:56.587
- No, I don't suppose you would.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.798
- Well, now that the chitchat portion
of our evening is over,

34:59.973 --> 35:01.429
why are you here?

35:01.600 --> 35:04.012
Why get inked with a symbol
you know nothing about?

35:05.520 --> 35:08.307
- I know it's worn by the Troubled.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.687
I know my father had one.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.940
- Garland Wuornos didn't have a tattoo.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.442
- Chief wasn't my biological father.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.854
A guy named Max Hansen was.

35:17.032 --> 35:19.239
- Max? Wow.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.525
Uh, we didn't know that.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.659
- You ever run into him?

35:24.539 --> 35:26.200
- Before my time.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.330
- What's with the gloves?

35:31.504 --> 35:33.756
- Well, you're right about one thing.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.794
You don't get the tat
unless you're Troubled.

35:40.347 --> 35:41.462
- So?

35:42.641 --> 35:43.756
- Pain.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.970
Terrible, searing pain.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.931
One touch and you're doubled over
on the floor,

35:49.105 --> 35:51.562
wishing you'd never been born.

35:51.733 --> 35:54.224
- Can you control it?

35:55.278 --> 35:56.734
- Of course not.

35:57.781 --> 35:59.988
I can't touch anyone without them.

36:01.201 --> 36:03.192
I haven't been able to for years.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.573
Stop. What are you doing?

36:09.751 --> 36:11.082
(gaSDS)

36:13.922 --> 36:15.878
You don't feel it?

36:16.925 --> 36:18.165
- No.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.254
I don't feel anything ever.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.806
That's my Trouble.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.721
- Can I have my hand back, please?

36:34.484 --> 36:37.396
- I'm one of you, and I want to help.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.606
l'll prove you can trust me.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.112
- How?

36:43.952 --> 36:45.283
- You tell me.

36:51.835 --> 36:54.497
- Do the cops know you're doing this?

36:54.671 --> 36:56.411
Audrey Parker know?

36:56.589 --> 36:59.752
- No. This is personal.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.715
- I'll talk to my people.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.593
- Thanks.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.914
- This better not be about my case.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.295
- Actually... it's about you.

37:39.466 --> 37:43.004
- A friend at the Boston Herald
shared some interesting things

37:43.178 --> 37:46.796
about a shooting you were involved in
a few months ago.

37:47.807 --> 37:48.762
- Really.

37:48.933 --> 37:53.302
- We were curious if Nathan knew
why Internal Affairs was so interested.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.388
- Never came up.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.267
- Well, maybe it's best it doesn't.

38:02.363 --> 38:03.773
(sighs)

38:03.948 --> 38:07.987
- You know, you two aren't the only ones
who know how to do some digging.

38:08.161 --> 38:11.278
Wonder how much Nathan knows
about your past.

38:11.456 --> 38:14.823
Think he knows that you two
not only own the Haven Hera/d,

38:15.001 --> 38:17.913
but half of all the commercial
real estate in Haven?

38:18.087 --> 38:19.793
(chuckles)
I doubt it.

38:20.882 --> 38:24.795
Took me digging through layers
of shell companies just to figure it out.

38:24.969 --> 38:29.759
All of which then led
to a string of offshore bank accounts.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.140
You two are worth millions.
(chuckles)

38:32.310 --> 38:34.767
I mean, not like I could tell
based on your wardrobe.

38:34.938 --> 38:37.145
- Yeah, well, it's family money.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.727
- The Teagues go back
to the very founding of Haven.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.017
- Your family might,
but not the money.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.686
There is no record of a trust
or transfer of monies

38:44.864 --> 38:46.946
on the federal tax rolls.

38:47.116 --> 38:50.358
It's almost as if it just appeared
out of thin air.

38:52.580 --> 38:56.038
Care to explain?
- Not really.

38:56.209 --> 38:59.246
- Didn't think so.
(chuckles)

38:59.420 --> 39:01.251
Listen, how about this?

39:01.422 --> 39:05.210
You stay out of my business,
and I will stay out of yours.

39:06.135 --> 39:08.217
- Yeah, that might be for the best.

39:08.388 --> 39:11.050
- For now.
- Yeah...

39:13.768 --> 39:16.635
All this supernatural crap
that goes on around here...

39:18.231 --> 39:20.893
Why are you two so caught up
