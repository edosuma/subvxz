00:01.542 --> 00:03.406
Previously on Tyrant...

00:03.456 --> 00:05.491
Jamal's accident wasn't an accident.

00:06.288 --> 00:08.164
It was an attempt on his life.

00:08.214 --> 00:10.724
A woman tried to inject him with poison.

00:10.860 --> 00:13.104
Her loyalty was to Ihab Rashid.

00:14.096 --> 00:15.490
He's a terrorist.

00:15.540 --> 00:18.090
Now thank him for sending us Samira.

00:18.245 --> 00:22.221
You have filled your pockets
collaborating with the Al Fayeeds.

00:22.271 --> 00:25.887
I'm an Al Fayeed.
That means I'm a powerful man here.

00:26.029 --> 00:28.242
Are you saying you want to stay?

00:28.377 --> 00:31.242
Without family, we have nothing.

00:31.329 --> 00:35.302
Without family, we are nothing.

00:35.451 --> 00:37.540
Jamal, it's, uh... it's me, Bassam.

00:37.935 --> 00:41.222
What would you think
if I hung around for a while?

00:51.711 --> 00:52.934
Good morning.

00:52.984 --> 00:54.365
Good morning.

00:54.486 --> 00:56.997
Are you Hamid Mahfouz?

00:58.374 --> 01:00.451
Are you the husband of this woman?

01:00.579 --> 01:01.808
Mommy?

01:09.212 --> 01:11.619
I believe that you are.

01:15.191 --> 01:16.573
I need you to come with us.

01:16.666 --> 01:18.710
What about my children?
Who will take care of them?

01:18.783 --> 01:20.023
- Ziad: You have neighbors.
- Baba!

01:20.144 --> 01:22.695
They will keep an eye out.

01:56.532 --> 01:58.333
♪ ♪

02:06.208 --> 02:08.342
Good morning.

02:14.952 --> 02:17.772
You have your first council meeting today.

02:17.907 --> 02:20.998
How long have you been
here in my bed?

02:22.663 --> 02:26.293
- Leila: Most of the night.
- Jamal: Why?

02:27.273 --> 02:28.732
I...

02:29.082 --> 02:33.793
I didn't want you to spend
the first night out of the hospital alone.

02:35.130 --> 02:37.271
It just seemed wrong.

02:46.949 --> 02:49.855
I've been giving it a
lot of thought, Jamal.

02:50.177 --> 02:55.789
I think it's important that
we behave like a couple again.

02:57.701 --> 02:59.108
Pssh...

02:59.277 --> 03:02.228
You've given it a lot of thought, huh?

03:02.360 --> 03:05.198
Now that I'm the president? What?

03:05.334 --> 03:10.270
- Suddenly you are filled with feelings
for me? - Leila: Not suddenly, Jamal.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.715
I always have, you know that.

03:17.379 --> 03:21.159
You want this, and I want this for you.

03:21.209 --> 03:22.549
For me?

03:22.685 --> 03:25.019
Yes, for you.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.852
What an amazing morning.

03:39.902 --> 03:44.984
First, my wife decides to put
aside all the hurt feelings and

03:45.034 --> 03:49.543
humiliation I have caused her and
crawl back into my bed now,

03:49.678 --> 03:51.607
when I'm useless as a man.

03:51.657 --> 03:56.517
And suddenly, my brother decides
not to run back to California

03:56.652 --> 03:59.364
to treat measles and chickenpox and mumps,

03:59.444 --> 04:04.524
but to stay here and
help me hold the country together.

04:05.731 --> 04:07.661
Bassam is staying? Why?

04:07.983 --> 04:10.131
Because he is my brother.

04:10.224 --> 04:12.961
Because this is our home.

04:14.395 --> 04:16.853
And because he offered and I said yes.

04:16.930 --> 04:18.898
Okay, but we don't need
the help of Bassam.

04:18.978 --> 04:22.276
We have each other, Jamal.
We've lived here our whole lives.

04:22.355 --> 04:25.204
We don't need the help of someone
who ran away 20 years ago

04:25.254 --> 04:27.629
- and now needs a map to find his way...
- Jamal: Stop it.

04:27.679 --> 04:28.500
Around the country.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.818
Stop it.

04:35.591 --> 04:37.802
I don't know exactly what I'll be doing.

04:37.852 --> 04:39.622
They sent over this briefing book,

04:39.672 --> 04:44.598
so I know today I'll be in
a bunch of meetings, but day in, day out...

04:45.231 --> 04:49.124
I just think that, with everything
that's going on around here,

04:49.385 --> 04:51.546
your grandfather dying

04:51.619 --> 04:53.203
and uncle Jamal recuperating,

04:53.253 --> 04:57.378
it's... it's just not
the right time for me to go.

05:01.641 --> 05:03.691
Well, I think it's a great idea.

05:03.741 --> 05:05.631
Um, do you want me to stay?

05:05.700 --> 05:08.962
- I mean, you know, keep you company?
- Emma: God, you are truly an ass.

05:09.012 --> 05:11.091
I mean, you know,
I feel like we're walking away

05:11.226 --> 05:14.328
from an excellent college essay
experience, here.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.191
Can I talk to you in the other room?

05:22.231 --> 05:23.927
Sure.

05:29.036 --> 05:31.292
What if we stay, too?

05:32.045 --> 05:35.020
Didn't we talk about this last night?

05:35.117 --> 05:36.984
- Your practice, the kids' schools...
- Molly: I know, I know. I know we did.

05:37.119 --> 05:40.035
I just... I can't decide which
I find more frightening:

05:40.108 --> 05:43.565
You being so far away,
or us being so far away from you.

05:43.666 --> 05:45.034
I just... I...

05:45.162 --> 05:48.095
I don't think it makes any sense.
I'm gonna be gone three weeks,

05:48.230 --> 05:49.881
- maybe a month.
- Molly: You don't know that.

05:49.931 --> 05:52.248
You have no idea how long
you're gonna be here.

05:53.666 --> 05:54.661
I-I'm just saying,

05:54.711 --> 05:57.949
I love that you're finally
making a connection

05:58.043 --> 06:00.406
with these people, this place.
You know?

06:00.493 --> 06:02.079
Filling in some blanks.

06:02.847 --> 06:04.245
I guess...

06:04.860 --> 06:07.657
I just thought it would be nice
to be part of it with you.

06:07.869 --> 06:10.383
It would. It would be nice.

06:10.519 --> 06:14.522
If we didn't have kids.
If we didn't both have medical practices.

06:14.656 --> 06:18.626
If we didn't have a thousand obligations
pulling us back home.

06:19.174 --> 06:23.264
I just... I don't see how it
makes any sense.

06:26.109 --> 06:27.799
Okay.

06:28.032 --> 06:30.184
Do what you have to do.

06:30.378 --> 06:32.235
Tomorrow night,
the kids and I'll fly home

06:32.285 --> 06:36.362
and while you're sleeping,
we'll be going on with our lives,

06:36.428 --> 06:39.427
and while we're sleeping,
you'll be going on with yours.

06:39.477 --> 06:42.890
And then in three weeks...
or three months, or whenever...

06:42.940 --> 06:46.419
we'll all be back
in the same time zone again.

06:47.632 --> 06:50.224
And you're right. What's the big deal?

08:24.687 --> 08:27.355
Shouldn't Jamal hear
from me personally?

08:27.490 --> 08:29.190
It's better if I go alone.

08:29.325 --> 08:33.160
But... Oh, Bassam.

08:33.294 --> 08:35.830
You remember Walid Rashid,
from the wedding?

08:35.965 --> 08:37.365
Of course.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.600
Uh...

08:38.734 --> 08:40.168
Yeah.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.102
Uh-uh-uh...

09:02.852 --> 09:05.879
His... his chair.

09:06.896 --> 09:10.765
I would sit in his lap...

09:10.900 --> 09:13.401
here on the floor by his feet.

09:13.841 --> 09:16.951
His wisdom, his patience, his nerve...

09:17.204 --> 09:20.341
I tried to soak it all in.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.678
I did soak it all in.

09:24.514 --> 09:27.849
I am ready, and now
it's your turn, my son.

09:27.983 --> 09:31.853
Sit, listen, learn, so you can be ready.

09:36.798 --> 09:40.929
As you can see, I have invited
my brother Bassam to join us.

09:41.459 --> 09:45.924
In addition to being an Al Fayeed,
he is very wise, very loyal,

09:45.974 --> 09:51.211
and that is why I would like to make him
a permanent member of this body,

09:51.261 --> 09:54.640
with the title special
consul to the president.

09:54.777 --> 09:57.270
Uh, Mr. President,
I'm very honored, but, uh...

09:57.320 --> 09:59.300
I-I'm not sure
I'm gonna be here long enough to...

09:59.359 --> 10:01.546
to need or want a title.

10:01.865 --> 10:02.872
That's okay, Bassam.

10:02.922 --> 10:05.197
You can't use it up or wear it out.

10:05.302 --> 10:09.252
But I will feel better knowing
it's here for you in case you need it.

10:09.383 --> 10:10.792
That's all.

10:14.756 --> 10:15.930
Mr. President...

10:16.700 --> 10:19.178
I am sure you are aware that General Tariq,

10:19.234 --> 10:24.375
in his effort to find the people
responsible for the attempt on your life,

10:24.461 --> 10:27.608
has put Abbudin under martial law.

10:28.099 --> 10:30.386
Our old friend Walid Rashid is concerned

10:30.436 --> 10:33.191
that this will destroy
the summer pilgrimages,

10:33.250 --> 10:34.947
which begin next week.

10:35.447 --> 10:39.827
After all,
why would the expected 200,000 tourists

10:39.928 --> 10:42.653
come to Abbudin
only to be frisked and searched

10:42.712 --> 10:46.360
and ordered off the streets by 6:30?

10:46.495 --> 10:48.768
He wanted me to give you this petition,

10:48.818 --> 10:53.043
which is signed by over
a thousand business owners,

10:53.093 --> 10:56.847
all of whom will be impacted
by these police actions

10:56.897 --> 11:00.105
if they drag into next week.

11:06.897 --> 11:08.683
Walid gave you this, Yussef?

11:09.251 --> 11:10.002
Yes.

11:10.052 --> 11:12.751
And is Walid not
the uncle of Ihab Rashid,

11:12.801 --> 11:14.555
the very man we are looking for?

11:15.790 --> 11:16.566
Yes.

11:16.616 --> 11:19.747
Then tell Walid to hand over
his cowardly nephew,

11:19.861 --> 11:25.106
and General Tariq will suspend the curfew,
the roadblocks and everything else.

11:25.259 --> 11:26.550
Simple.

11:28.473 --> 11:32.735
If Walid knew
where his nephew was, he'd tell us.

11:32.867 --> 11:34.117
Have you asked him?

11:34.167 --> 11:39.247
Of course. And General Tariq
has questioned him as well.

11:39.438 --> 11:42.616
He claims he does not know
his nephew's whereabouts.

11:43.381 --> 11:45.755
You know what?
I don't believe him.

11:45.946 --> 11:47.354
Do you believe him, General?

11:48.004 --> 11:49.524
I believe very little
that's said to me

11:49.549 --> 11:52.034
unless I'm holding
the person's life in my hands.

11:52.372 --> 11:54.772
That having been said, nothing
would give me greater pleasure

11:54.797 --> 11:56.796
than to suspend martial law.

11:57.103 --> 11:59.143
And I'm still hopeful
that we can do that very thing

11:59.168 --> 12:01.471
prior to the beginning of the pilgrimages.

12:01.589 --> 12:05.178
But now would be a foolish time
to loosen our grip,

12:05.445 --> 12:09.510
since we finally know, with certainty,
that it was Walid's nephew

12:09.645 --> 12:14.415
Ihab Rashid who supplied the deadly
syringe used in the attack against you.

12:14.550 --> 12:17.719
- Yussef: "With certainty"?
- Tariq: There's a witness.

12:34.970 --> 12:39.540
- Tariq: Please, tell the council
your name. - Hamid: Ha-Hamid Mahfouz.

12:40.398 --> 12:44.508
- Tariq: And your wife's name?
- Hamid: Fatma Mahfouz.

12:44.834 --> 12:48.855
And were you aware of the...
relationship between your wife

12:48.905 --> 12:50.885
- and our president?
- Jamal: Stop! Stop, stop.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.396
Ahmed, I need you to leave.

12:53.446 --> 12:55.822
- Ahmed: Father...
- Jamal: Now!

13:07.489 --> 13:09.022
Again.

13:09.072 --> 13:12.157
Were you aware of the...
friendship between your wife

13:12.207 --> 13:14.538
and the president?

13:16.779 --> 13:21.757
She, uh...
she said she loved him.

13:23.952 --> 13:28.040
But if she loved him,
why then did she try to kill him?

13:28.090 --> 13:29.990
Ihab Rashid.

13:30.581 --> 13:34.155
He knew about them,
and he gave me the syringe.

13:34.205 --> 13:39.336
He said if she didn't do it,
he would kill our children.

13:40.973 --> 13:43.937
So I gave it to her,
and I told her what to do.

13:44.816 --> 13:46.612
Thank you for your testimony,
Mr. Mahfouz.

13:46.662 --> 13:48.415
We can transport the witness
back to the prison.

13:48.516 --> 13:50.744
Mr. President, please!
Please, I had no choice!

13:50.879 --> 13:54.215
I swear! Have some mercy on me
and my children, please!

13:54.350 --> 13:58.508
Lest anyone doubt
the very real peril our president faced,

13:58.558 --> 14:04.847
the laboratory reports have confirmed
the syringe was filled with deadly ricin.

14:05.076 --> 14:10.077
The good news is that we have captured
37 members of his Izz-al-Din brigade,

14:10.178 --> 14:11.704
all of whom we've jailed

14:11.754 --> 14:14.510
and all of whom are being
interrogated as we speak.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.067
It's only a matter of time
before we capture Ihab himself.

14:17.206 --> 14:19.032
Yussef, you tell Walid

14:19.082 --> 14:23.079
we are going to find his shit
of a nephew one way or the other.

14:23.274 --> 14:25.908
But if he makes me wait...

14:25.958 --> 14:26.848
Whaddump...

14:26.898 --> 14:28.582
I'll hang them both.

14:29.924 --> 14:33.427
Minister of commerce: Mr. President,
if I may turn your attention to docket...

14:33.614 --> 14:35.857
- Yussef: Welcome home. - Minister of
commerce: And discuss the funding for

14:35.991 --> 14:38.659
the installation of moving the sidewalk...

14:49.103 --> 14:51.204
Going to work.

14:53.374 --> 14:55.314
So you're babysitting?

14:55.364 --> 14:56.699
Mm-hmm.

14:56.894 --> 14:59.653
Samira...
don't forget the curfew.

14:59.771 --> 15:00.899
Okay.

15:01.607 --> 15:05.184
But if they need me to stay over,
I'll call you.

15:08.212 --> 15:09.516
Well,

15:10.306 --> 15:15.096
my first day as the president
is just about over

15:15.146 --> 15:18.030
and our nation is still here.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.270
It's going to be fine, papa.

15:29.210 --> 15:33.613
Look at him. Married man. Beautiful wife.

15:33.748 --> 15:36.049
Fresh, young.

15:39.053 --> 15:45.192
You just can't let her think for a minute
that you are satisfied.

15:45.326 --> 15:49.149
Always make her wonder:
"Am I doing enough?"

15:49.277 --> 15:51.738
Maybe something different tonight.

15:51.926 --> 15:55.914
Maybe something crazier tonight.

15:56.046 --> 15:57.353
As your doctor,

15:58.035 --> 16:02.738
I'm advising you to stop mixing brandy
with your prescription opioids.

16:04.105 --> 16:06.237
I believe it's time for dinner.

16:06.896 --> 16:09.367
You know what your problem is,
Bassam?

16:09.468 --> 16:11.051
You are no fun.

16:11.245 --> 16:15.449
I'm starting to think
all that western education

16:15.499 --> 16:18.557
has taken the Al Fayeed out of you.

16:55.205 --> 16:57.530
You know they've shut
off the internet again.

16:57.580 --> 16:58.597
Mm-hmm.

16:58.690 --> 17:00.575
And they've added more checkpoints.

17:00.679 --> 17:04.051
It seems like they're determined
to find you and stop you.

17:04.809 --> 17:07.877
Determined to make you pay
for what happened to the president.

17:07.992 --> 17:11.852
Even though
I had nothing to do with it.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.607
You scared? Hmm?

17:17.922 --> 17:21.220
No one knows
that we are here except my uncle.

17:21.270 --> 17:23.556
We are in the middle of nowhere.

17:23.691 --> 17:26.026
So...

17:38.539 --> 17:41.341
What are you doing? Open.

17:42.778 --> 17:46.246
Samira, you are offending Allah.

17:50.151 --> 17:54.020
- Samira: But am I offending you?
- Ihab: Yes.

18:33.427 --> 18:35.795
Ahmed, stop.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.697
Please.

18:37.832 --> 18:39.400
But we are married.

18:39.546 --> 18:41.468
We are supposed to be together.

18:42.076 --> 18:43.670
And we will be.

18:43.804 --> 18:45.605
I promise we will be.

18:47.890 --> 18:51.344
Tomorrow.

19:01.989 --> 19:08.383
- Walid: He's my brother's son.
- Yussef: It's not as if you had a choice.

19:10.673 --> 19:13.450
They're very good
at this sort of thing, you know.

19:13.658 --> 19:16.858
They'll be using stun grenades.

19:16.993 --> 19:20.115
Lots of sound and light, but no blood.

19:21.931 --> 19:24.809
Right.
They save that for the hangings.

19:24.859 --> 19:27.660
Yussef, I've shown you where he is.

19:28.070 --> 19:30.873
They're going to do what they have to do.

19:31.007 --> 19:34.375
Must I sit here and watch it?

19:34.960 --> 19:38.613
Close your eyes if you want.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.303
All done.

20:06.376 --> 20:08.644
Cigarette?

20:35.855 --> 20:39.092
I have asked our friend
from the United States

20:39.142 --> 20:41.025
to join us as we have some news

20:41.160 --> 20:44.296
to share that will be of interest to him.

20:47.774 --> 20:50.394
Approximately 45 minutes ago,

20:50.529 --> 20:52.336
soldiers from the president's office

20:52.386 --> 20:53.964
for internal security

20:54.014 --> 20:57.107
took Ihab Rashid and ten of his followers

20:57.197 --> 21:01.251
and a substantial cache of
illegal weaponry into custody.

21:05.403 --> 21:07.318
Thank you, General.

21:07.453 --> 21:09.950
You have your country's gratitude.

21:10.043 --> 21:14.680
I am happy. I hope
the united states is happy, too.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.179
Anything that signals the
end of the mass arrests

21:18.229 --> 21:20.435
and checkpoints and roadblocks and curfews

21:20.501 --> 21:24.000
absolutely pleases the United States, yes.

21:24.051 --> 21:27.371
Very kind. General...?

21:27.506 --> 21:30.930
At 12:00 noon, day after tomorrow,

21:30.980 --> 21:33.732
we will hang Ihab Rashid
in the Capitol square.

21:33.783 --> 21:38.766
And, at that time, all the domestic
protocols you mentioned will cease.

21:38.816 --> 21:41.452
In plenty of time for the pilgrimages,
I might add.

21:46.318 --> 21:48.252
Wait, they're gonna
publicly hang him?

21:48.302 --> 21:50.412
They still do that here?

21:50.463 --> 21:54.399
- John: Practically the national pastime.
- Barry: Without a trial.

21:54.533 --> 22:00.271
- John: Why delay the fun?
- Jamal: Bassam. Is there a problem?

22:00.406 --> 22:06.150
No, um... I don't know.
I-it just seems, as an outsider,

22:06.200 --> 22:10.291
that death by hanging,
without even the benefit of a trial,

22:10.341 --> 22:13.948
seems a kind of barbaric way
to deal with your enemies.

22:14.062 --> 22:15.886
It actually is quite effective.

22:16.022 --> 22:19.409
The strategic goal is to strike fear
into the hearts of anyone

22:19.459 --> 22:22.809
contemplating a challenge to this regime.

22:22.937 --> 22:24.174
And in my experience,

22:24.224 --> 22:28.048
the sight of a body swinging
from a noose strikes abundant fear.

22:30.049 --> 22:33.170
Thank you, everyone.
This meeting is adjourned.

22:39.355 --> 22:40.113
Hello?

22:40.163 --> 22:42.747
Fauzi. It's Bassam. You called.

22:42.882 --> 22:48.153
My old friend. So, I'm hearing
that you've joined the opposition.

22:48.626 --> 22:52.385
Special counsel to the president.
Impressive.

22:52.558 --> 22:54.734
Any way I can get a meeting?

22:55.706 --> 22:56.906
What are you talking about?

22:56.956 --> 22:59.578
Two days ago,
you couldn't wait to get rid of me.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.905
Okay, sure.
When do you want to meet?

23:02.284 --> 23:03.342
Now.

23:03.561 --> 23:05.514
Fauzi, it's 10:00 at night.

23:05.564 --> 23:06.837
I'm not gonna see Molly
and the kids for a while.

23:06.972 --> 23:08.268
Can't this hold?

23:08.379 --> 23:10.082
Well, I'm not sure
if it matters to you,

23:10.132 --> 23:12.592
but you're about to execute the wrong man.

23:12.836 --> 23:15.165
Well, that... that's the first
I've heard of it, but...

23:15.215 --> 23:18.449
Yeah, of course it matters, if it's true.

23:18.584 --> 23:20.187
Yeah, I've been working on this story

23:20.315 --> 23:22.828
ever since Jamal was first ambushed.

23:22.953 --> 23:25.460
Not that anybody's going to read it;
no one can.

23:25.510 --> 23:26.857
There's no way to post it.

23:27.538 --> 23:30.705
Someone did put that woman
up to killing your brother,

23:30.755 --> 23:32.529
but it wasn't Ihab Rashid.

23:32.665 --> 23:36.801
Fauzi, if you really believe this,
then I need a name and I need it now.

23:36.936 --> 23:38.642
Yeah, well, uh...

23:38.692 --> 23:40.183
I need a favor.

23:40.353 --> 23:42.405
What favor?

23:44.518 --> 23:48.035
My daughter was arrested
this evening with Ihab and his followers.

23:48.132 --> 23:50.827
See, the past few months,
she's become distant,

23:50.877 --> 23:52.216
more and more religious,

23:52.266 --> 23:55.110
but I had no idea
that she was involved with Ihab.

23:55.160 --> 23:59.704
If you bring her home to me,
Bassam, I'll give you the name.

23:59.815 --> 24:01.105
Wait a second, wait a second.

24:01.155 --> 24:02.824
Y-you want me to free
your daughter from jail

24:02.874 --> 24:03.914
and then bring her to you?

24:03.963 --> 24:05.565
How am I supposed to do that?

24:05.615 --> 24:07.498
Well, I'm sorry, my friend.

24:07.633 --> 24:11.970
I... I thought that you were
the special counsel to the president.

24:13.324 --> 24:15.136
So you Skype?

24:15.186 --> 24:17.012
Sure.

24:17.788 --> 24:19.388
But you've never been on a plane?

24:19.438 --> 24:23.445
You've never... never left Abbudin?

24:24.410 --> 24:26.232
What for?

24:26.625 --> 24:28.909
I don't know, uh...

24:29.110 --> 24:34.976
To see things, learn things...
try things...

24:35.118 --> 24:36.902
No.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.026
I can do all that here.

24:39.092 --> 24:42.312
As long as I'm careful.

24:42.362 --> 24:43.729
Okay.

24:47.548 --> 24:51.588
Then I guess when I,
when I go home tomorrow, we can, um...

24:51.709 --> 24:53.377
Skype.

25:08.060 --> 25:13.998
- Can I ask you something?
- Abdul: You can ask me anything.

25:14.133 --> 25:18.636
- Sammy: Do your parents know?
- Abdul: Know what?

25:39.831 --> 25:41.932
You okay?

25:56.256 --> 26:00.116
So, your father told me...
and I told the judge who freed you...

26:00.252 --> 26:03.091
That your getting arrested was an accident.

26:03.141 --> 26:06.088
That you have nothing to do
with Ihab Rashid.

26:06.138 --> 26:09.140
The problem is,
they found your car at his safe house,

26:09.255 --> 26:11.748
so they're gonna ask questions.

26:11.798 --> 26:15.433
Now, the best I could come up with,
of the top of my head, is that

26:15.621 --> 26:17.669
you were carjacked by some of his men

26:17.780 --> 26:21.405
and they took you back there to, uh, to...

26:21.455 --> 26:24.291
rob you and rape you.

26:24.517 --> 26:27.943
It's not an ideal story,
but... but I need you to stick with it

26:27.998 --> 26:30.129
and not say anything different
to your friends.

26:30.179 --> 26:34.791
I don't want to give the government
an excuse to put you back in jail.

26:34.841 --> 26:37.014
Can I count on you to play along?

26:45.263 --> 26:48.632
Oh! I'm so happy to see you.

26:52.006 --> 26:56.240
What the hell were you doing
with those men? Ihab Rashid?

26:56.374 --> 26:58.983
I was trying to make a difference.

26:59.079 --> 27:01.978
Something you wouldn't understand.

27:02.070 --> 27:04.186
Samira, wait.

27:05.454 --> 27:07.730
Did you thank the man, at least?

27:10.422 --> 27:17.528
He's an Al Fayeed.
I don't owe him anything. He owes me.

27:23.180 --> 27:24.901
She's young.

27:25.036 --> 27:28.660
I keep telling myself
it's going to pass.

27:28.710 --> 27:32.052
I just want her to live through it.

27:32.493 --> 27:34.400
I'm sorry about your father.

27:35.576 --> 27:36.945
No, you're not.

27:36.995 --> 27:38.131
I am.

27:38.370 --> 27:39.848
I knew his son.

27:40.020 --> 27:41.917
He's a good friend of mine.

27:42.053 --> 27:44.484
I asked him for a favor and he did it.

27:44.534 --> 27:48.258
I think he deserves better
than to be insulted by a child.

27:51.027 --> 27:54.219
The only thing I deserve is
what you promised me:

27:54.269 --> 27:57.700
the name of the man
who tried to kill my brother.

27:59.337 --> 28:01.138
Very well.

28:03.542 --> 28:07.839
I was going to scan
these documents and post them tonight.

28:08.830 --> 28:10.745
Instead, I'm going to give them to you.

28:10.795 --> 28:14.049
The man you're looking
for is Hamid Mahfouz.

28:14.639 --> 28:16.602
Fatma's husband?
No, we've already talked to him.

28:16.706 --> 28:19.624
He's the one who testified against
Ihab at the council.

28:19.893 --> 28:20.795
Yeah, well...

28:20.845 --> 28:24.851
you might also want to look at the analysis
of what really was in that syringe.

28:24.987 --> 28:25.942
Bassam, I have friends at the lab.

28:25.992 --> 28:27.995
I trust you won't compromise their safety.

28:28.133 --> 28:30.262
I don't understand.
We already know what was in the syringe.

28:30.366 --> 28:33.702
It was ricin,
just like it said in all the news reports.

28:33.822 --> 28:40.877
Read the research, talk to Mahfouz
and then decide what to do, Bassam.

29:15.835 --> 29:18.067
Hamid Mahfouz?

29:18.117 --> 29:19.249
Yes.

29:20.825 --> 29:22.969
I'm the president's brother.

29:23.019 --> 29:25.186
I'm Bassam Al Fayeed.

29:25.236 --> 29:29.515
I'm also the president's special counsel.

29:30.358 --> 29:33.253
I want you to tell me why you're in prison.

29:33.445 --> 29:37.111
Because I gave my wife Fatma
a needle full of ricin

29:37.161 --> 29:39.274
to kill president Jamal Al Fayeed,

29:39.324 --> 29:41.119
at the behest of Ihab Rashid.

29:41.169 --> 29:43.063
That is not why you're in prison.

29:43.127 --> 29:45.627
Why are you in prison?

29:49.298 --> 29:52.481
It's 12:30 at night and
I'm asking you a question.

29:52.549 --> 29:53.942
But I just told you the answer.

29:53.992 --> 29:57.254
No. You told me
what you were told to tell me.

29:57.374 --> 29:59.622
What did they promise you?

30:01.757 --> 30:02.881
Who was it?

30:02.970 --> 30:06.843
- General Tariq?
- Hamid: General Tariq promised me nothing.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.507
That they'd execute Ihab Rashid and

30:08.557 --> 30:10.277
in a couple of months you'd be out of here?

30:10.319 --> 30:13.194
'Cause you know that's never gonna happen.

30:14.045 --> 30:16.556
Listen to me, you are in prison

30:16.606 --> 30:17.822
because you know too much, my friend.

30:17.882 --> 30:20.881
And I don't believe
you're ever getting out of here.

30:22.198 --> 30:23.880
What do I know?

30:24.269 --> 30:27.789
Well, at the very least...

30:28.078 --> 30:31.780
I think you know
there was no ricin in that syringe.

30:32.441 --> 30:35.322
And I'm betting
you've never even met Ihab Rashid.

30:35.372 --> 30:36.572
- Hamid: Yes, I...
- Barry: No.

30:36.665 --> 30:38.531
See, I have a report right here

30:38.581 --> 30:42.935
that says the only thing
in that syringe was bathroom cleanser.

30:43.079 --> 30:44.238
Now, I have to believe,

30:44.288 --> 30:46.400
if you really were working for Ihab Rashid,

30:46.450 --> 30:50.756
he's not gonna risk his one shot
at my brother on tub and tile cleaner.

31:05.941 --> 31:08.052
How are your kids?

31:08.102 --> 31:09.713
Your two boys?

31:11.464 --> 31:13.748
They told you anything about them?

31:13.798 --> 31:16.092
They told you where they are?

31:16.502 --> 31:19.894
Have they even shown you a picture?

31:22.997 --> 31:25.032
I'm the president's brother, Hamid.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.345
And I pledge to you...

31:26.395 --> 31:28.990
even though we both know
you tried to kill him...

31:29.062 --> 31:31.109
tell me what's really going on here

31:31.186 --> 31:33.979
and I will make sure
that no matter what happens to you,

31:34.029 --> 31:35.309
your children will be cared for.

31:35.356 --> 31:37.380
That is my promise to you.

31:37.990 --> 31:41.447
Your brother is the devil!

31:41.497 --> 31:44.742
Your brother destroyed my life.

31:47.078 --> 31:49.775
Okay, listen,
I know that your wife and my brother...

31:49.852 --> 31:53.689
Your brother would come to my home
whenever he felt like it.

31:53.739 --> 31:54.898
Take my wife.

31:54.966 --> 31:57.659
Do whatever he wanted with her,

31:58.059 --> 32:01.284
while me and my sons
sit outside in the hall,

32:01.384 --> 32:03.528
listening to him grunt and groan.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.085
Guns pointed to our heads.

32:07.602 --> 32:10.360
When he leaves, she would cry

32:10.453 --> 32:13.640
until there were no more tears in her body.

32:14.764 --> 32:18.437
Week in and week out, over and over again.

32:19.635 --> 32:22.579
You said she loved him.

32:22.718 --> 32:24.293
"Loved him"?!

32:26.008 --> 32:28.974
We were at the market buying food

32:29.094 --> 32:31.635
when he saw her from his fancy car.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.156
He picked her out like a piece of meat.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.568
"Loved him"?

32:37.637 --> 32:39.479
Every time he leaves,

32:39.812 --> 32:43.016
she would bathe in scalding hot water

32:43.321 --> 32:46.781
just to burn his essence off her skin.

32:49.908 --> 32:54.270
And finally, one day,
she came to me and told me,

32:54.320 --> 32:59.949
"if he comes here one more time,
I will kill myself."

33:00.473 --> 33:06.189
And I told her, "no.
This is backwards. We will kill him."

33:08.578 --> 33:11.599
"We must kill him."

33:19.786 --> 33:21.625
What are you doing?

33:23.001 --> 33:25.952
I don't think
I can do this without you.

33:26.606 --> 33:29.343
And I don't think I can not do this.

33:29.918 --> 33:34.355
Are you okay?
You look like you've been through a war.

33:36.024 --> 33:38.664
Is this you finally asking me to stay?

33:38.813 --> 33:41.133
This is me pleading with you.

33:41.205 --> 33:45.183
I can't... do it by myself. It's so dark.

33:45.272 --> 33:48.387
Every time I, I think I've hit the bottom,
there's a, there's another sub-basement.

33:48.483 --> 33:52.670
And I just need,
I need one other sane person here

33:52.746 --> 33:55.849
that I can talk to, just-just
one other sane person.

33:55.899 --> 33:59.354
Okay. I'm here.

33:59.679 --> 34:04.464
We're all here as long
as you need us. Okay?

34:05.034 --> 34:07.490
As long as it's safe.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.655
- Barry: Okay.
- Molly: Yeah.

34:20.969 --> 34:24.706
Okay. Okay.

34:25.206 --> 34:25.826
I'll be back.

34:25.876 --> 34:28.465
Wait. Where you going?
It's the middle of the night.

34:28.708 --> 34:31.012
To make it safe.

34:35.751 --> 34:37.551
It's your brother.

34:46.969 --> 34:47.813
What?

34:49.995 --> 34:52.235
Goddamn it, I don't know
what the hell is wrong with you.

34:52.261 --> 34:57.507
Aah, Bassam, you're choking me!
It's okay. He's my brother.

34:57.961 --> 35:01.766
You could have anyone.
But it had to be her, didn't it?

35:01.847 --> 35:02.937
The weakest.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.446
The meekest.

35:04.496 --> 35:06.699
With her husband
and her children within earshot.

35:06.752 --> 35:09.791
Why is it only satisfying
for you to pummel the other person?

35:09.843 --> 35:12.621
Huh? That something you learned from dad?

35:17.109 --> 35:18.261
Stop it.

35:18.782 --> 35:20.031
Stop it!

35:21.328 --> 35:23.429
What are you both doing?

35:23.828 --> 35:25.370
You're insane.

35:25.450 --> 35:27.063
Jamal, what is he talking about?

35:27.148 --> 35:29.637
- Jamal: Nothing that concerns you.
- Barry: Oh, really?

35:29.771 --> 35:32.070
'Cause I'd be interested
to hear Leila's opinion on that.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.362
Why don't we ask her?

35:33.430 --> 35:34.711
Yes, please.

35:34.815 --> 35:35.570
I would love that.

35:35.626 --> 35:38.275
No, it's between you and me.

35:39.199 --> 35:42.205
Listen, I know you are upset.

35:42.956 --> 35:46.749
If we could just talk, me and you.

35:47.841 --> 35:50.952
Please.

35:51.510 --> 35:53.680
Come.

35:55.998 --> 36:01.393
Brother, I know I have done bad things.
But I am the president now.

36:02.537 --> 36:05.737
My wife is back home with me.

36:05.787 --> 36:09.295
You are back in Abbudin with me.

36:09.345 --> 36:11.877
I want to be a new man.

36:12.014 --> 36:14.045
And this will never happen again.

36:15.246 --> 36:17.679
Why don't I believe that?

36:18.105 --> 36:19.585
You know that, in less than 24 hours,

36:19.610 --> 36:21.986
you're gonna hang an innocent man?

36:22.199 --> 36:25.213
No. Ihab Rashid is not an innocent man.

36:25.298 --> 36:26.193
He's innocent of this.

36:26.243 --> 36:28.218
He had nothing to do with that woman.

36:28.268 --> 36:29.467
How do you know that?

36:29.517 --> 36:31.821
Let's start with the fact
that your witness was coerced

36:31.905 --> 36:34.145
and your evidence is completely fabricated.

36:34.229 --> 36:38.439
That is General Tariq's doing.
I'm not necessarily aware of...

36:38.573 --> 36:41.712
- Barry: Stop it.
- Jamal: The evidence is beside the point.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.731
Let's say there is no evidence.

36:43.815 --> 36:45.627
What difference does it make?

36:45.677 --> 36:48.902
The man is plotting
the overthrow of my government.

36:48.952 --> 36:52.651
If he's not guilty of this,
he's guilty of something else.

36:52.788 --> 36:55.388
That's not how it works!

36:55.814 --> 36:58.038
This is the 21st century, okay?

36:58.114 --> 37:01.395
The whole world is watching
and you're gonna get caught.

37:01.445 --> 37:02.838
And when people figure out

37:02.923 --> 37:06.354
that you knowingly killed
this rock star of a rebel leader

37:06.404 --> 37:07.403
for a crime he didn't commit,

37:07.507 --> 37:10.200
you'll be staring
at a full-blown revolution.

37:10.309 --> 37:13.083
They'll hang you, they'll hang your son.

37:13.133 --> 37:15.174
They'll hang me, if I'm still here.

37:15.310 --> 37:18.979
And not a country on the planet
is gonna lift a finger to stop them.

37:19.114 --> 37:20.886
What do you want me to do?

37:20.959 --> 37:24.070
Just tell me what to do and I will do it.

37:24.294 --> 37:26.330
They are building the gallows.

37:26.402 --> 37:28.457
The Capitol is waiting for the pilgrims.

37:28.553 --> 37:30.886
The whole world is watching, as you say.

37:31.789 --> 37:33.792
What will you have me do?

37:33.860 --> 37:37.196
Open the jails and set everyone free?

37:37.401 --> 37:40.592
Yeah. Yeah.
We could start with that, sure.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.704
Apparently
it's a new day in Abbudin.

37:43.839 --> 37:44.968
President Jamal Al Fayeed,

37:45.076 --> 37:48.175
in office less than a week
since the death of his father,

37:48.239 --> 37:51.558
freed 30-some political prisoners
today and admitted

37:51.608 --> 37:54.484
that the manhunt
used as a pretext to round them up

37:54.534 --> 37:57.050
was based on the mistaken assumption
that their leader was involved

37:57.134 --> 38:00.225
in an assassination attempt
on the President's life...

38:00.275 --> 38:02.032
You have to apologize.

38:02.578 --> 38:04.376
You have to say you're sorry.

38:04.793 --> 38:07.957
Those two children
already lost their mother.

38:08.346 --> 38:10.743
Now, I need to know they'll be cared for.

38:10.807 --> 38:14.444
You have to guarantee they'll be cared for.

38:15.103 --> 38:15.913
Money, schooling...

38:15.993 --> 38:18.820
We're talking a million dollars.

38:18.870 --> 38:20.973
In a trust fund. Irrevocable.

38:23.111 --> 38:28.080
This is some bargain
you are brokering, brother.

38:28.309 --> 38:30.440
And what do I get?

38:32.624 --> 38:39.553
You get me... here... with you...
helping to fix this place.

38:53.875 --> 38:58.154
Oh, yeah. And you get a body to hang.

39:37.814 --> 39:39.814
Is everything okay?

39:39.998 --> 39:44.023
You worked out what you needed with Bassam?

39:44.159 --> 39:46.260
It was nothing.

39:46.349 --> 39:48.773
A passing storm.

39:49.982 --> 39:52.113
We are brothers.

39:52.201 --> 39:54.835
Brothers fight.

39:57.806 --> 39:59.907
It was nothing.
