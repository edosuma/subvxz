00:15.645 --> 00:19.285
<i>It's a matter of national</i>
<i>security that we contain this situation.</i>

00:19.365 --> 00:21.365
<i>-I'm sure you understand.</i>
-Yes, Minister.

00:21.445 --> 00:24.765
-I need to get out. Let me out of here!

00:26.765 --> 00:28.885
What happened in Davoren Park
is a tragedy

00:28.965 --> 00:32.285
and now a 16-year-old boy,
Robbie Lambert, is an orphan.

00:32.365 --> 00:35.205
Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!

00:35.685 --> 00:37.085
We'll find out what's going on.

00:37.164 --> 00:39.325
<i>-Where's Markson?</i>

00:39.405 --> 00:41.045
Corporal Markson was captured.

00:41.125 --> 00:44.645
I want a briefing after they land.
Have the Pakistani ambassador standing by.

00:44.725 --> 00:48.205
I'm looking for a senior media advisor,
full salary with benefits.

00:48.285 --> 00:51.325
-This is classified. Who sent it?
-Called themselves the Rabbit.

00:51.405 --> 00:55.325
Enemy killed in action... my father,
my mother, my husband, my little boy.

00:55.405 --> 00:58.125
Did you send an email to my ex-cellmate?
Are you the Rabbit?

00:58.205 --> 01:01.485
You'd be well advised to keep your
distance from Mina and Sami Almasi.

01:01.885 --> 01:05.445
2003, Iraq. You shot down the ADF inquiry.

01:05.525 --> 01:08.365
Special Forces planted drop weapons
on an innocent family

01:08.445 --> 01:10.045
to make them look like insurgents.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.965
I've called a press conference
for tomorrow morning

01:13.045 --> 01:16.365
to announce an inquiry
into the Special Forces incident.

01:18.525 --> 01:21.685
It was a trap. You need to get out
before they come for you.

01:21.765 --> 01:23.125
-They set us both up.
-Who?

01:23.205 --> 01:25.005
-The fucking Rabbit?
-What?

01:34.645 --> 01:38.005
<i>The minister was shot,</i>
<i>execution-style, to the back of the head.</i>

01:38.085 --> 01:41.205
-<i>...cold-blooded...</i>
-<i>I never voted for her, but she...</i>

01:41.285 --> 01:44.845
...<i>The nation's capital is reeling</i>
<i>after the shock assassination</i>

01:44.925 --> 01:48.325
<i>of Home Affairs Minister</i>
<i>Catriona Bailey last night.</i>

01:48.405 --> 01:53.125
<i>No charges have been laid and police</i>
<i>are tight-lipped about potential suspects,</i>

01:53.205 --> 01:55.125
<i>leaving many to ask the question,</i>

01:55.205 --> 01:58.805
<i>was this murder politically motivated?</i>
<i>And will there be more?</i>

01:59.085 --> 02:01.285
<i>Stepping in as acting</i>
<i>home affairs minister</i>

02:01.365 --> 02:05.845
<i>is Garrity's trusted right-hand man,</i>
<i>Jim Hellier, who wasted no time</i>

02:05.925 --> 02:09.965
<i>in ordering a complete security lockdown</i>
<i>of Parliament House.</i>

02:10.045 --> 02:11.525
<i>We will bring you all the details</i>

02:11.605 --> 02:13.885
<i>-as they emerge. Back to you in the stu--</i>

02:24.365 --> 02:26.725
- Ready?
-As I'll ever be.

02:29.205 --> 02:30.165
Don't worry.

02:31.005 --> 02:34.725
It's like riding a bicycle...
through a frigging war zone.

02:41.125 --> 02:43.965
<i>Lockdown. Lockdown. Lockdown.</i>

02:44.965 --> 02:47.685
<i>This is an emergency warning announcement.</i>

02:48.165 --> 02:51.045
<i>Proceed immediately</i>
<i>to the nearest secure room.</i>

02:51.725 --> 02:54.965
<i>Lock all doors. Set devices to silent.</i>

02:55.285 --> 02:58.885
<i>Freedom is not</i>
<i>a crown worn lightly.</i>

02:59.485 --> 03:02.405
<i>It weighs heavy with responsibility</i>

03:02.485 --> 03:06.525
<i>for those of us</i>
<i>who are fortunate enough to wear it.</i>

03:06.605 --> 03:10.845
<i>Prime Minister Garrity teeters</i>
<i>on the brink of a minority government,</i>

03:10.925 --> 03:13.965
<i>with a cabinet minister</i>
<i>apparently assassinated</i>

03:14.045 --> 03:15.925
<i>on the streets of the capital.</i>

03:16.005 --> 03:20.125
<i>Messages of condolence continue to pour in</i>
<i>from heads of state around the world,</i>

03:20.205 --> 03:24.765

<i>at a brazen and brutal attack</i>

<i>that has shaken the foundations</i>
<i>of our democracy.</i>

03:28.085 --> 03:30.645
<i>And the Australian people</i>
<i>are looking for answers</i>

03:30.725 --> 03:34.845
<i>on what is a dark day for the nation</i>
<i>and for a Garrity government</i>

03:34.925 --> 03:37.045
<i>-now very much under siege.</i>
-Fuck.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.925
Do we need to lock down the House,
for God's sake?

04:30.765 --> 04:33.485
We needed to make sure
that no one was going in or out,

04:33.565 --> 04:38.205
while we put the new security measures in
place. I'm not taking any chances, Ewan.

04:38.285 --> 04:40.245
You asked me to look after
Bailey's portfolio

04:40.325 --> 04:42.325
till you found a replacement.
This is part of it.

04:42.405 --> 04:44.445
I know. I appreciate you stepping up.

04:45.325 --> 04:46.765
I'm not going to miss her.

04:48.445 --> 04:50.525
She had one eye on your back
the whole time.

04:51.685 --> 04:54.405
Directors-General from ASIO and ASD, sir.

04:54.485 --> 04:56.885
-Anyone been charged?
-Not yet.

04:57.485 --> 04:59.845
We do have
a potential person of interest.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.565
-Personal grudge against the minister.
-That's good.

05:02.885 --> 05:05.765
It's still ASIO's recommendation
to raise the alert.

05:06.085 --> 05:09.125
-I'm not in favor.
-Well, there's Davoren Park to consider.

05:09.565 --> 05:11.765
We've got records
of dark-web conversations

05:11.845 --> 05:15.525
between the Lambert boy
and militant leftists, The Collective.

05:15.765 --> 05:17.245
They were planning something.

05:17.485 --> 05:20.885
It's possible they were using
Lambert's house to stockpile explosives

05:20.965 --> 05:24.325
for a terror attack and something
went wrong, accidental detonation.

05:24.405 --> 05:27.125
Since then, chatter among
The Collective has escalated.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.925
We're not discounting the possibility
of another event.

05:30.805 --> 05:31.965
Another bomb?

05:58.565 --> 06:00.925
Patricia. Minister.

06:02.245 --> 06:03.285
Sorry for your loss.

06:04.765 --> 06:08.365
It's the first time
that wanker's looked higher than my boobs.

06:10.125 --> 06:14.525
Listen to this. "Lock up Robbie Lambert,
throw away the key and we can sleep safe."

06:14.605 --> 06:17.925
It's that dread-peddler Gaelene Curtis
from the opposition, with all the hair.

06:18.005 --> 06:21.205
Looks like she's got a couple
of orangutans screwing on her head.

06:21.285 --> 06:25.405
I didn't join your staff to be paraded
around like some dog-and-pony show.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.125
Why do you think I hired you?
I want to be heard.

06:28.205 --> 06:31.445
If I get attention because of who you are,
then good. Whatever it takes.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.245
Huh. I've got people looking
to me to look after them.

06:34.325 --> 06:35.325
What, like Robbie Lambert?

06:36.365 --> 06:38.925
He's not a terrorist.
I know him, I knew his family.

06:39.005 --> 06:42.165
Our intelligence agency seems to think
they've got enough to detain him.

06:42.245 --> 06:45.245
I thought you'd give him
the benefit of doubt.

06:45.845 --> 06:47.885
It's Gaelene. I'm gonna give her what for.

06:47.965 --> 06:51.085
Listen, Karen. Just...
If you want to be heard, stop shouting.

06:51.165 --> 06:53.125
Stop tweeting every 20 seconds.

06:53.605 --> 06:56.925
Ask to speak to Robbie and get him
a lawyer. That's what he needs.

06:57.005 --> 07:00.405
Not some self-serving, mud-slinging match
in the Twittersphere.

07:01.365 --> 07:02.965
Huh! This is going to be fun.

07:04.205 --> 07:05.045
Griff.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.605
That's 22.55.

08:13.965 --> 08:16.165
That card's been canceled. Got cash?

08:16.805 --> 08:17.645
No.

08:46.804 --> 08:49.164
- Hey! Hey!

08:50.165 --> 08:51.245
Shit!

09:12.965 --> 09:13.965
They lost her.

09:17.005 --> 09:21.005
- So, how did we get this file?
-USB left it at the Embassy in Islamabad.

09:21.605 --> 09:23.365
<i>You talk! You talk now!</i>

09:24.605 --> 09:29.685
<i>My name is Corporal Gavin Markson.</i>
<i>I am a member of Redback One,</i>

09:29.765 --> 09:32.125
<i>currently based in Afghanistan,</i>
<i>on the Pakistani border.</i>

09:34.445 --> 09:37.405
<i>Based on intelligence</i>
<i>collected by my unit,</i>

09:37.485 --> 09:41.485
<i>the United States conducted</i>
<i>an aerial strike on a vehicle...</i>

09:42.645 --> 09:45.205
<i>in the Pakistani territory</i>
<i>of Northern Waziristan...</i>

09:45.725 --> 09:48.125
<i>killing two members</i>
<i>of the Haqqani Network...</i>

09:48.485 --> 09:51.925
<i>and General Tariq Nazir</i>
<i>of the Pakistan Armed Forces--</i>

09:52.925 --> 09:55.045
Targeting a Pakistani general?

09:55.125 --> 09:58.245
We targeted high-value members
of the Haqqani, Prime Minister.

09:58.325 --> 10:00.245
This is the first I've heard
of General Nazir.

10:00.325 --> 10:03.085
What's a general doing
in a jihadist's car? Sightseeing?

10:03.565 --> 10:07.445
Pakistan claims it wants to regain control
of the tribal lands.

10:07.525 --> 10:10.645
The General could have been negotiating
Haqqani withdrawal.

10:10.725 --> 10:12.045
So, who's got our man?

10:12.125 --> 10:16.245
Well, on the face of it, Haqqani,
but we took out a general,

10:16.325 --> 10:20.605
so this could have been orchestrated
by Pakistani authorities as a response.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.925
They wanted a hostage.
As soon as they got Markson,

10:24.005 --> 10:26.645
-they were gone.
- What do they want? Exchange?

10:26.725 --> 10:30.605
They might not want anything except
revenge. This might just be a taunt.

10:33.045 --> 10:35.245
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
-Get me the Pakistani Ambassador.

10:35.325 --> 10:38.485
<i>-I think heâ€™s out of town.</i>
-I don't care if he's on the fucking moon.

10:38.565 --> 10:40.205
-I want to see him.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

10:41.165 --> 10:45.285
<i>I want to come home.</i>
<i>Please... bring me home.</i>

10:56.605 --> 10:59.565
You could start with
our Innovation and Jobs media release.

10:59.645 --> 11:01.405
You know,
I actually report directly to Karen.

11:03.605 --> 11:07.205
The electorate's lost 4,000 jobs
since the car factory shut down.

11:07.285 --> 11:11.125
Karen wants the factory repurposed. We
must get big industry back into Wakefield.

11:11.205 --> 11:13.965
-That's a state issue.
-They're talking, but that's all.

11:14.045 --> 11:17.045
Karen thinks we can bypass all that stuff
and not wait for the wonks

11:17.125 --> 11:20.285
in South Australia that we know aren't
going to get anything done soon.

11:20.365 --> 11:22.685
If you can make some punch
in the media on a national level,

11:22.765 --> 11:26.885
you know that people will get behind it
and, before too long, we've cut through.

11:27.285 --> 11:29.645
That's what she's trying to do.
It's why we're in Canberra.

11:33.365 --> 11:36.325
What are you doing, Harriet?
You would never take a job on this side.

11:36.405 --> 11:39.045
I don't believe it for a second.
What are you up to?

11:39.125 --> 11:41.685
What are you up to, Griff?
You don't even have a minister any more.

11:41.765 --> 11:45.645
-Been asked to stay on with Hellier.
-You know where the bodies are buried.

11:45.725 --> 11:48.725
I think
I'm way behind you in the body count.

11:52.925 --> 11:54.085
We go way back.

11:55.405 --> 11:59.605
What does it mean if I can't access
a Home Affairs document on the server?

11:59.685 --> 12:04.165
It means it's restricted... to the secure
computer system in the ministerial wing.

12:04.845 --> 12:08.405
You do know about digital fingerprints?
Everyone's got a digital code.

12:08.485 --> 12:10.725
You try to access a document,
it leaves a record.

12:12.445 --> 12:15.885
So if I could access a document,
I could find out who else had accessed it?

12:16.365 --> 12:17.325
Sure.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.405
And if you could get
to a restricted document,

12:24.485 --> 12:27.285
you would also be
in a nice, deep pile of shit.

12:28.325 --> 12:30.005
-Oh. See you.
-Where are you...?

12:32.805 --> 12:33.725
Good start.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.285
Hi, Thomas.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.565
-I don't owe you anything.
-You don't think?

12:57.605 --> 13:01.365
I spent two years of my life feeling
like shit... for doing my job.

13:02.485 --> 13:04.485
Kim stole classified material.

13:06.485 --> 13:07.525
What was I supposed to do?

13:10.445 --> 13:13.285
I need to get into
the Home Affairs secure system.

13:13.845 --> 13:17.725
I want to find out who accessed this
and I think that you can do that for me.

13:17.805 --> 13:18.645
I can.

13:20.325 --> 13:21.405
But I'm not going to.

13:43.885 --> 13:47.325
You okay? Everything all right.
You have everything you want?

13:49.565 --> 13:50.885
We've got nothing to hide.

13:52.685 --> 13:54.085
You're not going to learn anything.

13:56.325 --> 13:57.685
Mina didn't do it.

13:58.565 --> 14:01.005
If she didn't do it,
Mr. Almasi, where is she?

14:02.605 --> 14:05.765
And why was her mobile phone found
on the road heading out of town?

14:31.125 --> 14:33.965
I mean... Christ, Mum, hospital leftovers?

14:36.245 --> 14:37.085
Thanks.

14:39.205 --> 14:41.805
Come home, Harri. This place is a dump.

14:42.165 --> 14:45.605
Yeah, well, it's right for me
at the moment. I need some space.

14:46.645 --> 14:48.445
When did I ever not give you space?

14:50.845 --> 14:52.005
I got work to do.

14:54.285 --> 14:56.325
Lasagna tomorrow. See you then.

15:51.245 --> 15:54.165
-Hello?
- <i>You were supposed to leave.</i>

15:54.845 --> 15:58.645
Uh... I, uh... I couldn't. Where are you?

16:01.085 --> 16:01.925
Mina?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.125
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

16:07.205 --> 16:10.645
Listen, I found where to access
the redacted document.

16:10.725 --> 16:13.565
So, if I can get to it,
then we'll know who set you up.

16:15.605 --> 16:19.445
And if you get caught...
how am I supposed to be okay with that?

16:19.805 --> 16:21.925
<i>Listen, have you got a place to stay?</i>

16:22.925 --> 16:25.885
I'm not telling you. Too risky.
Even Sami doesn't know.

16:26.445 --> 16:27.845
I need to talk to him.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.285
<i>What for?</i>

16:31.885 --> 16:33.485
It's better that you don't know.

16:38.285 --> 16:40.645
Mina, all we ever had was trust.
You're the one who said that.

17:01.285 --> 17:03.165
<i>Okay, you all right there?</i>

17:04.005 --> 17:04.845
<i>Settled?</i>

17:10.045 --> 17:11.165
All right.

17:21.844 --> 17:23.205
Let's see who's listening.

17:28.965 --> 17:33.285
<i>Independent South Australian</i>
<i>MP Karen Koutoufides is leading the charge</i>

17:33.364 --> 17:35.805
<i>for ASIOâ€™s release of Robbie Lambert.</i>

17:35.885 --> 17:38.405
<i>Evidence linking him</i>
<i>to the Davoren Park explosion</i>

17:38.485 --> 17:40.365
<i>remains undisclosed at this time.</i>

17:40.445 --> 17:43.325
Koutoufides is gaining traction.
Human Rights Watch just responded.

17:44.325 --> 17:46.885
Human rights? What about the rest of us?

17:46.965 --> 17:49.885
What about our right not to get blown
to kingdom fucking come?

17:50.685 --> 17:53.125
Uh, line up a call with ASIO DG.

17:58.005 --> 18:00.845
I've been granted an access visit
with Robbie this afternoon.

18:00.925 --> 18:03.085
-Oh.
-A welfare check.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.685
-That's good.
-Tiny problem.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.485
The meeting's in the middle of Question
Time. They've done it deliberately.

18:09.565 --> 18:12.885
-Then I wouldn't put pressure on the PM.
-Don't worry about Question Time.

18:12.965 --> 18:15.725
-You can't be in two places at once.
-I can't, no.

18:17.245 --> 18:21.325
No, I got a ton of meetings today and I'm
trying to get you a headline interview.

18:21.445 --> 18:24.525
-I got to be here to do my job.
-This is your job.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.805
He's got no one else.

18:34.285 --> 18:37.925
Please. I need a break.
I need to go to the toilet.

18:41.165 --> 18:44.605
We traced these conversations
back to your laptop.

18:44.685 --> 18:49.045
I don't know about any collective.
I don't know about any of this.

18:49.685 --> 18:50.925
This is you talking.

18:52.645 --> 18:57.045
"We want maximum damage, need to strike
fast. Targets to be arranged."

18:57.125 --> 18:59.485
No. I said thatâ€™s not me.

19:01.285 --> 19:02.805
Please...

19:02.885 --> 19:04.525
I need to go to the toilet.

19:05.165 --> 19:08.285
What was the target?
What were you planning to strike?

19:11.085 --> 19:12.445
Why would I kill my own family?

19:14.485 --> 19:16.525
I don't know about any of this.

19:18.565 --> 19:20.005
Donâ€™t you lie to me, Robbie.

19:20.765 --> 19:24.205
Lying to me would be
a very, very bad idea.

19:27.685 --> 19:32.365
Ambassador, it's now day seven of Corporal
Markson being held in Pakistani territory.

19:32.445 --> 19:35.645
Now, we need to know exactly
what your government's doing...

19:36.285 --> 19:37.965
to facilitate his location.

19:38.285 --> 19:40.405
I understand your distress,
Prime Minister,

19:40.485 --> 19:45.325
and you have my government's sympathy,
but the Haqqani are in Pakistan illegally,

19:45.405 --> 19:47.525
and we don't have contact with them.

19:48.125 --> 19:51.285
General Nazir,
what was he doing in a terrorist's car?

19:52.045 --> 19:55.445
Your soldiers are not the only targets
for kidnapping, Minister.

19:55.845 --> 19:59.285
My government, of course,
is doing everything in its power

19:59.365 --> 20:03.165
to find your Corporal Markson,
but you must understand,

20:03.245 --> 20:05.445
it's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

20:08.885 --> 20:10.885
Thank you, Ambassador.

20:12.845 --> 20:13.685
Prime Minister.

20:22.125 --> 20:24.485
-They know where he is.
-Yeah.

20:25.845 --> 20:29.005
We need to put the pressure on.
A sanctions warning?

20:29.085 --> 20:32.885
No, that'd make it public, and I think
we've got to be smarter than that.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.885
Half the US military are looking for him.
There's lots of eyes in the sky.

20:37.405 --> 20:38.485
We'll get him back...

20:40.005 --> 20:40.845
quietly.

20:47.165 --> 20:50.085
I know this is hard for you
but it shouldnâ€™t take much longer.

20:50.885 --> 20:54.525
Robbie, have you had access
to adequate facilities during questioning?

20:54.605 --> 20:57.325
Things like toilet breaks and water.

21:00.645 --> 21:02.845
Robbie, I canâ€™t help
if you wonâ€™t talk to me.

21:04.085 --> 21:05.365
I do have one question.

21:08.085 --> 21:09.325
You going to get me out of here?

21:11.645 --> 21:13.765
I mean, we are doing everything we can.
-So, that means no?

21:18.045 --> 21:20.245
We have to conclude your visit,
Miss Dunkley.

21:35.165 --> 21:38.125
Robbie, I want you to know
you have a lot support out there.

21:38.645 --> 21:39.725
Robbie, no, please don't.

21:39.805 --> 21:41.885
-Put the weapon down!
-Let me out!

21:41.965 --> 21:43.405
-Please!
-Put the weapon down!

21:43.765 --> 21:46.325
-Let me out!
-Donâ€™t hurt him! Please!

21:46.405 --> 21:48.125
-Put the weapon down!
-Please donâ€™t hurt him!

21:48.205 --> 21:49.325
-Please!

21:53.605 --> 21:55.445
Out! Get her out!

21:55.725 --> 21:56.645
Robbie.

22:12.485 --> 22:13.405
Fuck.

22:30.005 --> 22:30.885
Hi.

22:32.125 --> 22:35.085
No, I just... I just left now.
It went fine.

22:36.445 --> 22:37.685
Yeah, no drama.

22:37.765 --> 22:39.725
Hey, Karen, I'll be in there soon.

22:40.445 --> 22:41.285
Bye.

23:02.365 --> 23:03.605
Hey, Sami. It's Harriet.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.165
I need a favor.

23:33.925 --> 23:34.765
Hello, Thomas.

23:38.085 --> 23:41.085
-Wait. Do I know you?
-We have a friend in common.

23:43.045 --> 23:44.485
She spoke to you yesterday.

23:47.045 --> 23:48.365
She wanted a favor.

23:50.245 --> 23:52.245
I'm... I'm sorry, but...

23:52.325 --> 23:55.885
It would mean so much...
if you could help her out.

23:58.085 --> 23:59.365
I'd be very grateful.

24:05.205 --> 24:07.205
You see my friend, Mustafa, over there?

24:07.925 --> 24:09.245
He's not as patient as me.

24:09.325 --> 24:10.285
You understand?

24:26.525 --> 24:28.605
Take some time to think about it, Thomas.

24:31.325 --> 24:32.725
You might change your mind.

24:34.725 --> 24:35.605
For you.

25:16.365 --> 25:18.845
Word is the Libs have picked
a candidate for the by-election.

25:19.485 --> 25:22.925
Don't know why they're bothering.
Bailey's diehards won't change now.

25:23.005 --> 25:24.045
Mm.

25:24.645 --> 25:25.925
Who's that with Gaelene Curtis?

25:29.765 --> 25:31.365
Lobbyist from Vanguard Energy.

25:33.325 --> 25:34.445
Vanguard Energy?

25:35.045 --> 25:39.885
They want to open a solar thermal plant
in Victoria. Gaelene wants it to be in...

25:42.085 --> 25:42.925
Big industry.

25:44.485 --> 25:46.325
Big, new, shiny industry.

25:49.485 --> 25:50.685
Hold the fort, Dec.

25:59.045 --> 26:01.845
Hello, Gaelene. How's the lamb?
Not too fatty for you?

26:01.925 --> 26:04.165
Karen Koutoufides.
Independent for Wakefield.

26:04.245 --> 26:07.525
-Alex Berezin, Vanguard Energy.
-We're in the middle of a meeting.

26:07.605 --> 26:12.245
You need a solar plant. I've got a disused
car factory that's begging to be reopened,

26:12.325 --> 26:16.365
and a very keen workforce. Infrastructure
coming out your proverbial...

26:16.445 --> 26:19.005
Karen, you've got a worthless piece
of real estate

26:19.085 --> 26:21.285
-and a bunch of meth-head bogans.

26:21.725 --> 26:23.005
Go back to your table.

26:23.285 --> 26:26.445
Think about it, Mr. Berezin,
then come and have a chat with me.

26:27.045 --> 26:30.365
-You won't even have to buy me dinner.
-I'm buying him dinner.

27:11.285 --> 27:12.165
Okay. I'm here.

27:13.205 --> 27:14.045
Okay.

27:22.845 --> 27:24.525
Right. You've got ten seconds.

27:31.085 --> 27:32.325
Okay, I'm at the door.

27:38.285 --> 27:39.125
Okay.

27:47.045 --> 27:48.005
Okay.

27:55.685 --> 27:57.565
<i>Now, insert the USB.</i>

28:03.565 --> 28:06.285
<i>Now, listen, that's going to brute-force</i>
<i>the password.</i>

28:09.605 --> 28:11.205
Okay, I'm in. I'm, uh...

28:12.045 --> 28:17.045
I'm just going to put in...
document number now.

28:23.245 --> 28:24.645
<i>Why's it taking so long?</i>

28:26.005 --> 28:27.885
<i>Thomas, it's not here.</i>

28:30.765 --> 28:33.285
Try again.
Check you're putting in the right one.

28:33.365 --> 28:35.445
I put the right number in. It's not here.

28:37.565 --> 28:38.485
Shit.

28:39.565 --> 28:41.845
<i>Harriet, close it down and get out.</i>

28:42.205 --> 28:43.925
Okay, just hold on. It's got to be here.

28:55.845 --> 28:56.685
<i>Harriet?</i>

28:57.845 --> 29:00.765
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Don't answer that phone.</i>

29:01.085 --> 29:04.445
Some sort of internal phone log system
has just come up for Catriona Bailey.

29:04.525 --> 29:07.205
<i>-Do not touch that.</i>
-Jesus, it lists every call.

29:15.165 --> 29:18.525
-What are you doing?
-Just... just hang on one second.

29:20.525 --> 29:22.525
<i>-Do not touch anything else.</i>

29:22.605 --> 29:24.405
<i>Do not access any other files.</i>

29:33.205 --> 29:34.205
What is going on?
<i>Lockwood.</i>

29:39.325 --> 29:41.565
- <i>Hurry up.</i>
-Okay. I'm getting out.

29:52.885 --> 29:55.485
- <i>Harriet, I'm warning you.</i>

29:55.565 --> 29:56.405
Harriet!

29:58.205 --> 29:59.165
Shit.

30:08.285 --> 30:09.485
You said she'd be here.

31:06.445 --> 31:08.925
<i>The number that you have dialed</i>
<i>is not available.</i>

31:09.005 --> 31:11.205
<i>There is no message service</i>
<i>with this number.</i>

32:03.885 --> 32:05.725
- This is a bad idea.
-I know.

32:07.045 --> 32:09.405
Whoever this Rabbit is,
they're the one who set me up.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.125
Or maybe they're the killer.

32:12.005 --> 32:14.245
Why would the Rabbit message
my phone now?

32:14.925 --> 32:19.405
It feels like they know I'm digging around
and... and it's a warning to stop.

32:19.485 --> 32:22.245
-Did you find the document?
-No, I found something else.

32:22.605 --> 32:24.685
Davoren Park, what does that mean to you?

32:24.765 --> 32:27.405
It's the house in Adelaide,
the one that blew up.

32:27.485 --> 32:30.685
Catriona Bailey called
the Chief of Defense

32:30.765 --> 32:34.565
17 times that night,
almost immediately after the explosion.

32:34.645 --> 32:38.045
And then the next night,
she called someone's mobile phone,

32:38.125 --> 32:40.885
someone who was standing
in the middle of Davoren Park.

32:41.565 --> 32:45.165
It feels like... or I think that someone's
trying to cover something up.

32:45.245 --> 32:47.845
-I think Bailey's involved.
-That's why she's dead?

32:50.965 --> 32:51.925
I don't know.

32:53.285 --> 32:54.205
I mean...

32:57.045 --> 32:58.525
Do I want to do this again?

32:59.605 --> 33:00.645
Like, do I?

33:01.965 --> 33:03.365
It's your decision, Harri.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.485
Don't do it for me. Okay?

33:21.765 --> 33:23.325
<i>Let me out!</i>

33:23.405 --> 33:25.005
<i>-Shut up!</i>
- <i>Put the weapon down!</i>

33:25.085 --> 33:27.965
- <i>Don't shout at me!</i>
- Don't hurt him!

33:30.645 --> 33:32.325
<i>Out! Get her out!</i>

33:32.405 --> 33:36.285
- That's your poor orphan boy.
-He's desperate. That's all that means.

33:38.125 --> 33:40.605
You might want to reconsider
your position, Karen.

33:41.485 --> 33:44.285
You might want
to tell your boss the next time

33:44.365 --> 33:46.925
he's got something to tell me,
he can do it himself.
I'm here because I believe
in what my minister is trying to do.

33:51.765 --> 33:54.765
I wonder, can you say the same thing
of your media adviser?

33:56.045 --> 33:59.405
Harriet is not a team player.
I mean, she never has been.

34:01.965 --> 34:03.045
Thanks for your time.

34:08.005 --> 34:08.845
Come in.
Shut the door.

34:14.805 --> 34:19.644
I can't have you hiding things from me...
especially something like this!

34:22.724 --> 34:23.565
Well?

34:25.405 --> 34:27.605
I didn't want to tell you
that he attacked me

34:27.684 --> 34:30.485
because I thought that
then you'd change your mind

34:30.565 --> 34:32.125
about Robbie and stop fighting for him.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.405
I don't play games like that.
I thought you knew that.

34:35.684 --> 34:37.845
Are we on the same page, Harriet?
Because...

34:37.925 --> 34:40.845
Because this place
is like a 24/7 shit fight.

34:40.925 --> 34:42.724
-Yeah.
-I need to know I can rely on you.

34:42.805 --> 34:44.125
You can, 100%.

34:45.085 --> 34:49.724
-Good.
-You know that there is a way around this?

34:49.805 --> 34:52.244
-We just got to get in first.
-Oh, really?

34:52.325 --> 34:54.525
You release the video. Put our spin on it.

34:54.605 --> 34:57.644
I mean, Robbie was traumatized.
The video, I assume, shows that.

35:01.005 --> 35:02.165
No, it'd backfire.

35:03.685 --> 35:07.285
It'd get their attention, then we could
use that to ask the questions we want.

35:08.365 --> 35:10.565
Ludie Sypek wouldn't be able to resist it.

35:47.125 --> 35:51.125
Catriona Bailey loved
this country... and its people.

35:53.125 --> 35:56.925
When she first joined Parliament,
she took an oath to serve...

35:57.845 --> 36:00.805
which she did, tirelessly, faithfully...

36:02.005 --> 36:03.005
in both Houses...

36:04.925 --> 36:06.405
for more than 30 years.

36:07.965 --> 36:10.125
I ask for a minute's silence now...

36:11.565 --> 36:16.445
as we remember
a true soldier of the people.

36:46.485 --> 36:50.085
Have you met our new candidate
for the by-election, Ian Casey?

36:50.165 --> 36:52.805
Jesus, Gaelene, the body's not even cold.

36:52.885 --> 36:54.805
-I'll be back in a second.
-Yeah.

36:54.885 --> 36:56.965
- Excuse me for a second.
-Harriet.

36:57.045 --> 36:59.365
-Yeah.
-I got your message and I'm interested.

37:00.245 --> 37:02.045
-Okay, and Karen?
-I don't think so.

37:02.685 --> 37:04.965
You don't get the video
unless she gets a voice.

37:05.325 --> 37:09.125
She's a minnow. I run a shark tank.
You really want to throw her into that?

37:10.205 --> 37:11.845
Yeah, I think she can handle it.

37:14.365 --> 37:16.725
-Okay, we'll see.
-Great.

37:20.485 --> 37:22.685
-Air Chief Marshal Lockwood?
-Yes.

37:22.765 --> 37:24.045
Hi. Um...

37:25.045 --> 37:29.805
The explosion at Davoren Park, why wasn't
Robbie Lambert arrested that night?

37:30.125 --> 37:31.925
Or at the very least, the next day?

37:32.725 --> 37:35.045
That's a counter-terrorism issue,
not my field.

37:36.045 --> 37:41.125
But I mean, aren't you the first port
of call in the case of terror activities?

37:41.685 --> 37:43.965
I wasn't aware
you were still a journalist, Miss Dunkley.

37:44.805 --> 37:48.605
Then why would Catriona Bailey call you
so many times that night?

37:48.685 --> 37:52.045
17 phone calls between her mobile
and your number,

37:52.125 --> 37:54.005
starting just a few minutes
after the explosion.

37:54.085 --> 37:56.645
This is before emergency services
even got there.

37:58.685 --> 38:02.005
This is a memorial. Have some respect.

38:08.445 --> 38:10.005
Ms. Koutoufides.

38:10.525 --> 38:11.725
Mr. Berezin.

38:12.685 --> 38:15.525
I was thinking about what you said
the other day and I was wondering

38:15.605 --> 38:18.165
if you might change your mind
about letting me buy you dinner?

38:20.405 --> 38:21.965
We've all got to eat, don't we?

38:23.245 --> 38:24.205
Mm.

38:26.725 --> 38:27.765
Beer, thanks.

38:31.525 --> 38:33.005
Big military presence.

38:33.085 --> 38:37.405
You guys planning a 21-gun salute? Or are
you going to shoot Bailey out of a cannon?

38:38.885 --> 38:40.085
Is it that obvious?

38:41.405 --> 38:44.325
You don't hang around the Chief of Defense
unless you're on the job.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.565
Joe Sullivan. Lieutenant.
Harriet Dunkley. Half-cut.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.165
I know who you are.

38:58.365 --> 38:59.405
Must've been tough.

39:00.645 --> 39:02.325
Two years stuck in a shitty cell.

39:03.965 --> 39:07.125
No worse than being stuck
in a shitty foxhole

39:07.205 --> 39:09.925
in someone else's country,
fighting someone else's war.

39:10.245 --> 39:12.805
It's everybody's war now.
Haven't you heard?

39:13.285 --> 39:14.845
What? You really believe that?

39:14.925 --> 39:16.645
I believe there are values
worth protecting.

39:17.285 --> 39:19.245
-Worth dying for?
-Fighting for.

39:20.645 --> 39:24.205
Isn't that why you went to jail?
Fighting for something you believed in?

39:26.125 --> 39:27.405
Ah, I'm not like you.

39:30.485 --> 39:31.845
You don't even know me.

39:48.605 --> 39:49.565
You okay?

39:50.245 --> 39:52.605
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

39:53.165 --> 39:55.805
Okay, just give me a minute.
Grab yourself a drink.

40:40.405 --> 40:41.525
Adelaide...

40:41.885 --> 40:42.765
Fuck.

41:25.085 --> 41:26.565
Did you get yourself a drink?

41:36.885 --> 41:41.005
<i>Mrs. Houli, this is Harriet Dunkley</i>
<i>from Karen Koutoufides' office.</i>

41:41.565 --> 41:44.405
<i>Iâ€™m going to be in Adelaide</i>
<i>this afternoon and I wondered</i>

41:44.485 --> 41:47.125
<i>if youâ€™d mind me driving out</i>
<i>to Davoren Park,</i>

41:47.205 --> 41:50.605
<i>just to ask you a few questions about what</i>
<i>happened on the night of the explosion.</i>

41:51.685 --> 41:56.085
<i>Could you please give me a call back</i>
<i>on this number? Thank you so much.</i>

42:01.725 --> 42:03.845
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

42:05.965 --> 42:07.605
It must be a relief to be home.

42:08.765 --> 42:09.685
Oh, it is.

42:10.325 --> 42:12.485
-Would you like some sugar?
-No, thank you.

42:15.045 --> 42:17.165
-Thank you. Sorry.

42:23.845 --> 42:30.045
So, um, who actually showed up
the, um... the night of the explosion?

42:31.285 --> 42:34.885
The... fire brigade, ambulance, police.

42:35.565 --> 42:39.125
And the men who evacuated us,
but they weren't wearing uniforms.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.365
Uh, so, you think
they might have been military?

42:42.445 --> 42:43.925
Special Forces or something?

42:45.685 --> 42:46.645
How's Robbie?

42:48.685 --> 42:49.885
It's not easy for him.

42:50.885 --> 42:52.685
Tell him we don't believe
what they're saying.

42:54.285 --> 42:55.245
Danny.

42:58.285 --> 43:00.725
Get Mrs. Dunkley something
she can take back for Robbie.

43:01.165 --> 43:02.525
Maybe a photo of you two.

43:06.485 --> 43:07.805
We weren't that close.

43:09.485 --> 43:11.365
I don't have many photos of us together.

43:13.125 --> 43:14.165
Is that Chloe Lambert?

43:19.645 --> 43:21.005
Was she your girlfriend?

43:23.485 --> 43:24.565
Nobody knew.

43:26.285 --> 43:27.685
She was only 15.

43:30.565 --> 43:33.685
Her bedroom was
right across there.

43:36.685 --> 43:38.165
Last time I saw her was that night.

43:40.285 --> 43:41.365
I used to video her.

43:43.565 --> 43:45.125
Nothing creepy.

43:46.485 --> 43:47.325
Just...

43:48.765 --> 43:51.005
-I can show you.
-Yeah.

44:03.365 --> 44:05.765
You don't want to see the rest.

44:10.045 --> 44:11.565
Was that the night of the explosion?

44:16.805 --> 44:19.405
Danny, do you think that
I could maybe take a copy of that?

44:56.485 --> 44:57.445
Cal.

45:03.045 --> 45:04.045
Talk to me.

45:09.885 --> 45:13.165
The house in Adelaide... it was a fuck-up.

45:15.885 --> 45:17.125
Yeah. I know.
It's okay, Cal.

45:25.565 --> 45:26.845
You're safe now. Come on.

45:29.405 --> 45:30.325
Come on.

45:37.005 --> 45:39.405
The police are okay
with releasing this information?

45:41.085 --> 45:44.605
I'm the minister for Home Affairs.
I am the police.

45:46.405 --> 45:49.685
<i>If we take the flip side here</i>
<i>and don't do anything...</i>

45:54.365 --> 45:55.565
Where are you?

46:23.805 --> 46:25.325
- <i>I want to get out.</i>

46:25.405 --> 46:29.205
<i>-Let me get out! Let me out! Shut up!</i>
- <i>Put the weapon down!</i>

46:29.285 --> 46:31.845
- <i>Don't hurt him!</i>

46:34.885 --> 46:36.685
<i>Out! Get her out!</i>

46:36.765 --> 46:38.605
A 16-year-old boy,

46:38.685 --> 46:40.605
he loses his entire family.

46:40.685 --> 46:42.485
He's detained. He's isolated,

46:42.565 --> 46:44.245
He's questioned without a lawyer.

46:44.325 --> 46:46.925
He's a violent terrorist.
He should be locked up.

46:47.205 --> 46:50.205
-Australians have a right to feel safe.
-They are safe.

46:50.485 --> 46:53.125
-How so, Minister?
-The questioning and detainment

46:53.205 --> 46:55.805
of Robbie Lambert is just one aspect
of the laws that are in place

46:55.885 --> 46:59.325
-for the protection of all Australians.
-Protection at what cost, Minister?

47:01.085 --> 47:04.005
<i>While we're in a rush to protect some,</i>

47:04.085 --> 47:05.645
<i>we're happy to abandon others.</i>

47:06.965 --> 47:09.605
If we don't adhere
to the principles of democracy,

47:09.685 --> 47:14.165
and that includes the rights, the basic
human rights of every single citizen,

47:14.245 --> 47:17.805
then we're on a fast track
to totalitarianism and, in that scenario,

47:17.885 --> 47:20.805
you'd be Goebbels, if you thought
for more than ten seconds

47:20.885 --> 47:22.805
before you opened your asinine pie hole.

47:23.165 --> 47:25.165
Australians have no need for alarm.

47:25.245 --> 47:27.965
Robbie Lambert is in custody
and I'm happy to announce

47:28.045 --> 47:32.165
the police are about to identify a suspect
in the murder of Catriona Bailey.

47:38.325 --> 47:40.525
<i>-Can you name the suspect?</i>
- <i>I can.</i>

47:41.245 --> 47:46.725
A convicted criminal with a personal
grudge against the minister. Mina Almasi.

47:46.805 --> 47:49.565
Mina Almasi. Doesn't she have
an association with

47:49.645 --> 47:51.445
your media advisor, Harriet Dunkley?

47:51.525 --> 47:54.685
Yeah. Yeah, they were jailbirds together
at Maconochie.

47:55.005 --> 47:56.805
Oh. Didn't you know that?

47:59.005 --> 48:00.325
Would you care to comment?

48:53.685 --> 48:54.605
Hi.

48:54.685 --> 48:58.845
Do you want to give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire your arse right now?

49:02.125 --> 49:03.565
No, Robbie didn't do it.

49:05.045 --> 49:06.045
The bomb...

49:08.245 --> 49:09.445
came from the sky.
