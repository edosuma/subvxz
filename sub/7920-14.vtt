WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:04.003
Ugh! Son of a bitch. Nothing.

00:04.005 --> 00:05.204
I'm trying to get
in touch with Sam--

00:05.206 --> 00:06.372
you know, to clear the air...

00:06.374 --> 00:09.041
Get out

00:09.043 --> 00:10.676
of my life.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.712
Why isn't he responding?

00:13.714 --> 00:15.714
I'm just gonna go out
on a crazy limb here--

00:15.716 --> 00:18.017
maybe it's because you got
his girlfriend to dump him?

00:18.019 --> 00:19.451
I'm not being weird about it.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.552
I just texted him three times.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.754
(sighs, groans)
And I called him.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.455
He wasn't there.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.556
I left him a sensible
voice mail.

00:24.558 --> 00:25.524
To lighten the mood,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.059
I told a little story

00:27.061 --> 00:29.361
about how
the first-graders' pet rabbit

00:29.363 --> 00:31.397
got stuck in the lawn mower

00:31.399 --> 00:33.365
and I had to...

00:33.367 --> 00:34.533
I had to collect it.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.701
That's a terrible story.

00:35.703 --> 00:36.869
Colonel FlapEars?

00:36.871 --> 00:38.570
Wow.
Unbelievable.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.205
I had to park two blocks away,

00:40.207 --> 00:41.540
like an animal.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.642
The new bar, Presh,
is doing valet

00:43.644 --> 00:45.144
and they took all of our spots.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.812
I've been saying for months
that we need valet.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.881
Is there anything sexier
than tossing your keys

00:48.883 --> 00:50.749
in the general direction of
someone you care nothing about?

00:50.751 --> 00:52.051
"Keep it running."

00:52.053 --> 00:53.886
Hi. I'm looking for Jessica Day.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.487
Oh, right here.
You've just been served.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.922
What?!
What?

00:58.893 --> 01:01.393
(gasps)
A restraining order?!

01:01.395 --> 01:02.461
From Sam.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.730
Oof...

01:04.732 --> 01:06.498
I'm not a restraining
order person.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.100
A restraining order.
That's worse than herpes.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.902
When I find Sam...
(laughs)

01:09.904 --> 01:11.036
I'm gonna kill him.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.504
You can't find Sam.

01:12.506 --> 01:13.906
'Cause you have
a restraining order.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.841
Winston.
You have to help me with this.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.743
Sam is the only one who
can drop this charge.

01:17.745 --> 01:18.844
But the magic

01:18.846 --> 01:19.912
of a restraining order

01:19.914 --> 01:22.581
is that you can't talk to him.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.183
And that...

01:24.185 --> 01:26.652
that is human drama.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.805

02:00.154 --> 02:01.386
You're the nutmeg wholesaler?

02:01.388 --> 02:04.123
Me? No, I'm not
the nutmeg wholesaler.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.291
You have a nutmeg
wholesaler vibe.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.459
That's what it is.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.827
I've been trying
to figure it out for years.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.829
You totally look like
a nutmeg wholesaler.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.431
Me no nutmeg...
CONNIE: How can I help you?

02:12.433 --> 02:13.298
Connie, hello.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.500
Very nice to meet you.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.336
We are both local
entrepreneurs,

02:17.338 --> 02:18.670
as you are.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.305
Uh, we co-own the
bar up the street,

02:20.307 --> 02:22.741
and there is a business
situation that we would like

02:22.743 --> 02:24.009
to bring to your attention...
Yeah, your stupid valet

02:24.011 --> 02:25.978
is taking all the spots
in front of our bar,

02:25.980 --> 02:27.479
and it's time for it
to come to an end.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.014
It's not sittin' well

02:29.016 --> 02:30.983
with us folks
over at the Griffin.

02:30.985 --> 02:31.650
What's a griffin?

02:31.652 --> 02:32.651
What is...

02:32.653 --> 02:33.952
wait, what is
the Griffin?

02:33.954 --> 02:36.088
The Griffin is
the name of the bar

02:36.090 --> 02:37.990
that we own together,
you buffoon.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.159
You don't know the name of our bar?
Why don't we...

02:40.161 --> 02:41.660
We don't have a sign.
We should have a sign.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.661
Is this the time for this?

02:42.663 --> 02:43.996
I feel like
this is a conversation

02:43.998 --> 02:45.164
I don't need to be a part of.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.698
My valet

02:46.700 --> 02:47.766
is totally legal.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.034
But thanks for stopping by.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.602
Maybe, you know, maybe
I'll stop by your bar.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.471
I'll just, like,
knock on doors until...

02:52.473 --> 02:54.606
until I find you.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.607
Uh, please don't leave.
Pl...

02:55.609 --> 02:57.376
Okay, leave.
We'll d-discuss this...

02:57.378 --> 02:58.677
I don't like this woman.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.012
Hey, uh, where
should I put this,

03:00.014 --> 03:02.047
uh, nutmeg?

03:03.851 --> 03:04.850
Hey.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.151
Hey.

Hey.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.021
Hey.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.623
The lady's name is Connie.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.758
She's o-over that way.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.528
I'm here to overturn
a restraining order.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.897
I brought lots of excellent
character references.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.700
In the words of Ms. Cheryl
Riggins of Portland, Oregon:

03:21.702 --> 03:23.902
"When the school
sewage line broke,

03:23.904 --> 03:26.138
"Jessica was the only student
who rolled up her sleeves,

03:26.140 --> 03:27.873
"grabbed a pail
and went to work.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.375
"She should be tested
for hepatitis immediately.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.844
Immediately."

03:32.846 --> 03:34.379
That's not the one...

03:34.381 --> 03:35.881
Uh, sorry about
that, Riggs.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.217
Uh, Jessica,
you better be here

03:38.219 --> 03:39.918
because you wrote a song
you wanted me to listen to.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.720
I just don't get
why Sam would do this.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.854
I'm not dangerous.
Hey.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.656
Friend face.
That was cute.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.725
Cop face.
Girl, sit yo' ass down.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.759
And use the word

03:47.761 --> 03:50.696
"allegedly" when discussing Sam.

03:50.698 --> 03:54.266
I do not need Internal Affairs
crawling all up in my holes.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.101
What if I typed up a note
and left it on his car?

03:56.103 --> 03:57.102
Oh, you stop it, Jess.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.904
Yeah, but I...

03:58.906 --> 04:00.072
Let it lie.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.607
Okay.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.108
No letters.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.543
JESS: This would've
been a better plan

04:04.545 --> 04:06.411
if I knew what he drives.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.347

A lot of black cars.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.282

No. No.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.269

oh, geez, oh, geez.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.775
Well, this is not my fault.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.916
Hey, Jess, I'm at work.
Is this a cop

04:44.918 --> 04:45.917
situation or a friend situation?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.486
Both. What would you say

04:47.488 --> 04:49.454
if I told you I was in the bed
of Sam's pickup?

04:49.456 --> 04:50.722
Allegedly.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.990

04:51.992 --> 04:53.825
Okay, good. So you're not
in the back of a truck.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.093
No, I am.

We should be ruining their bar.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.185
We should cut
their power.

By hating fads?

06:36.263 --> 06:38.230
That's... maybe just change it
to "trendy" bars.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.398

07:05.926 --> 07:07.125
or you don't.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.927
Because I care enough.
I'll fight.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.762
Let's do this.
What are we gonna do?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.597
We're gonna hit her where it hurts.
I'm in.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.832
Not the vagina.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.903
We're gonna go after the bar.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.771
Uh, yes, that's ri... N... There
was not even a single part of me

07:19.773 --> 07:21.106
that thought you were

Winston, sorry.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.117
Sorry, I hit some potholes,
and then we got on the freeway,

throwing pencils at me,

I had to pretend to be a mannequin.

fish before in my life.

You're a bad guy to

SCHMIDT: Give us a chance
to, first, apologize

09:41.882 --> 09:45.417
and, second, give you
a little bit of context here.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.253
You see, (chuckles) we thought
that you attacked our bar.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.556
Why would I attack a bar
that has no one in it?

09:51.558 --> 09:53.858
And if I did want to attack
you, I would just report you

09:53.860 --> 09:56.094
for one of your numerous
health code violations.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.762
Some improvements
definitely need to be made.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.098
We... we found a dead fox
in the keg room the other week.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.766
We're not sure
it was a fox.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.436
Uh, it was an animal that
had died in our keg room

10:04.438 --> 10:07.572
that was bigger than a cat
but smaller than a big dog...

10:07.574 --> 10:11.276
A word of advice:
do not mess with me.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.946
This past year has been
the worst year of my life.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.281
First, my cat died.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.949
Then my husband left me
for our neighbor,

10:17.951 --> 10:19.951
and so I had to listen
to them having sex

10:19.953 --> 10:21.786
through our bedroom wall
every single night.

10:21.788 --> 10:25.457
And then he left
my neighbor for my mother,

10:25.459 --> 10:27.592
which is, like,
a very long story

10:27.594 --> 10:29.894
that I don't really
want to get into.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.896
Then my other cat died.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.899
Then I ran over a dog
while I was driving to the vet

10:34.901 --> 10:37.469
with our dead cat on my lap.

10:40.107 --> 10:43.775
You guys messed
with my business...

10:43.777 --> 10:45.310
now I'm gonna have
to destroy you.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.979
If I may... ask...

10:47.981 --> 10:52.317

planning on destroying us.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.319

would be greatly appreciated.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.321

15:36.102 --> 15:37.635
Oh, not too long ago.
Congrats.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.604
Thank you. I appreciate that.
It's nothing, you know.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.439
I get to do a lot
of cool stuff on the job.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.207
I once slid across
the hood of a car.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.309
I scratched it all up.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.777
I didn't have to pay
for it, you know.

15:45.779 --> 15:46.911
'Cause I'm a cop, so...

15:46.913 --> 15:47.779
(Winston laughs)

15:47.781 --> 15:48.780
300 feet away.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.819
I've gathered
the families here today,

15:54.821 --> 15:55.887
to end this terrible, terrible,
unnecessary war.

15:55.889 --> 15:56.888
So, thank you.

15:56.890 --> 15:57.956
Connie and I

15:57.958 --> 15:58.957
have had our battles,

15:58.959 --> 16:00.425
but today we make our peace.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.793
She's of the north.

16:01.795 --> 16:02.994
She's the owner of Presh.

16:02.996 --> 16:03.995
What is this?

16:03.997 --> 16:04.996
I only came because you said

16:04.998 --> 16:06.497
you were suing me
for what I did,

16:06.499 --> 16:07.799
which, by the way, was nothing.

16:07.801 --> 16:08.900
I lied to ensure your presence.

16:08.902 --> 16:09.901
Good Lord.

16:09.903 --> 16:10.935
Over here, we have
Peter Verrebian.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.337
(muffled):
Yes.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.972
NICK:
Enjoying the pasta.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.606
He is also the owner
of Produce-slash-

16:15.608 --> 16:18.309
Cold Beer-slash-Ice.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.611
Peter, I know that's what the
sign above your market says.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.980
Is that the name
of your establishment?

16:21.982 --> 16:24.148
Yes.
Very creative.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.818
Oh, and AnaLysa from AnaLysa's
Nails wanted to be here,

16:26.820 --> 16:27.986
but she couldn't
find somebody

16:27.988 --> 16:29.320
to cover her register.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.289
And if you've ever gone
in that place, it's messy.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.623
Like, it's not a great...

16:32.625 --> 16:35.693
establishment.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.163
How did things get
this far, everybody?

16:39.165 --> 16:40.298
This is so weird.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.666
Thank you for the spaghetti.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.800
Wasn't that a nice thing to say?

16:42.802 --> 16:44.702
I wish we were all so polite.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.170
SCHMIDT:
I'd like to say something.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.406
I don't need you here, Schmidt.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.042
Connie...

16:51.044 --> 16:52.643
you know,
Presh may have booths

16:52.645 --> 16:53.978
made of reclaimed wood

16:53.980 --> 16:56.981
and carefully curated
artisanal flatware...

16:56.983 --> 16:59.350
but this bar will
have something

16:59.352 --> 17:01.019
that your fancy place
will never have.

17:01.021 --> 17:01.919
What's that?

17:02.856 --> 17:04.155
Nick Miller.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.223
Oh. Well.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.524
No, we'll never have that.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.727
Of course I'm proud that
this bar breaks even,

17:09.729 --> 17:12.363
but I think that you
can do better than that.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.298
I didn't just invest
in this bar, Nick.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.700
I invested in you.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.068
No, you didn't.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.203
You don't have equity
in me, and we're...

17:20.974 --> 17:22.540
I get it.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.344
Hey, Connie...

17:26.346 --> 17:29.213
yours isn't
the only bar on the block

17:29.215 --> 17:32.283
that has valet,
starting immediately.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.553
(sniffling quietly)

17:35.555 --> 17:38.656
We have valet, kiddo.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.891
You got valet.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.560
(voice breaking):
You got valet.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.729
This is beautiful.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.465
The valet's yours.
The valet's yours.

17:49.002 --> 17:50.735
Um... are they in love?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.037
Yes. Very much so.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.872
Okay. Hey, guys, um...

17:54.874 --> 17:56.841
let's just call a truce
and end this.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.910
If nothing else, so I can
stop dealing with you.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.578
I'll drink to that.
You got it.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.579
CONNIE (sighing deeply):
Okay.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.748
A toast?
To us. Salud!

18:03.750 --> 18:04.615
Okay.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.419
This is good.
This is really good.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.954
Uh, yeah. My buddy Andy
makes it in his basement.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.756
I'm not allowed to say
anything else about it, though.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.057
Wow, I'm not kidding.

18:13.059 --> 18:15.760
I think this is the best
whiskey that I've ever had.

18:15.762 --> 18:16.961
You want to go out
with me sometime?

18:16.963 --> 18:18.129
What? No. No.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.430
No, no, no. Never.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.265
Never. NICK: But the
whole back and forth

18:21.267 --> 18:22.934
with, like, the fish and
getting mad at each other...

18:22.936 --> 18:24.435
Never. Never.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.571
When you came back
and threw the fish down...?

18:26.573 --> 18:27.605
Nothing...?

18:27.607 --> 18:28.806
Where did you get there,

18:28.808 --> 18:30.741
from "I like this whiskey"
to...?

18:30.743 --> 18:32.543
What the hell was that? You know what?
Let it go. Let it go.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.612
This was, this is my mistake.
It was a misread...

18:34.614 --> 18:35.746
I would sooner
make love to Peter

18:35.748 --> 18:37.115
and his mouthful of spaghetti.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.183
(smacking):
Pass.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.752
Okay, Peter.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.121
Cheers.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.622
WINSTON:
<i> 298, 299...</i>

18:44.624 --> 18:46.057
Watch out for the lamp.

18:46.059 --> 18:47.959
And that's 300, right there.
Wait here.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.428
I'm dropping the restraining
order. This isn't necessary.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.497
I'll determine what's
necessary; I'm a cop.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.165
Stop! There's no more
restraining order.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.800
And no more cop face.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.301
Girl, this is my friend face.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.070
Honestly, I can't
tell the difference.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.271
Well, there is no difference.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.305
That's why I have
to announce it.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.474
And as your friend, Winston,

19:03.476 --> 19:04.742
I just want to make sure
that you two

19:04.744 --> 19:05.843
have thought things through.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.147
That you're not
rushing into things,

19:09.149 --> 19:10.148
you know?

19:10.150 --> 19:11.849
You don't hurt
each other again.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.684
I'm thinking, maybe,
as your friend,

19:13.686 --> 19:17.889
maybe... you should be
restraining yourselves.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.362
Because of
the restraining order?

19:24.364 --> 19:26.697
Look, we've grown up a lot.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.168
We've made mistakes and
we've learned from them.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.502
Jess, nobody takes out
a restraining order

19:31.504 --> 19:33.604
unless they think that
they're in danger.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.672
Winston's right.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.907
What?

19:37.343 --> 19:38.876
You're dangerous.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.845
I mean, you're dangerous to me.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.381
You want to know why
I got the restraining order?

19:43.383 --> 19:45.016
(inhales deeply)

19:45.018 --> 19:47.018
'Cause I couldn't stop
thinking about you either.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.886
I didn't trust myself
not to call you

19:48.888 --> 19:50.555
and start this
whole thing up again.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.491
You know,
you-you've changed, Jess,

19:53.493 --> 19:56.394
and that's great,
I just... I haven't.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.862
And I'm still mad at you and...

19:57.864 --> 20:00.031
that's gonna
take some time.

20:00.033 --> 20:03.134
I think the, uh, best,
smartest thing for us to do

20:03.136 --> 20:05.069
is to just... (inhales)

20:05.071 --> 20:06.737
say good-bye.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.373
(sighs heavily)

20:09.375 --> 20:11.375
What does Selena Gomez
always say?

20:11.377 --> 20:13.578
"Take your things and go..."

20:13.580 --> 20:16.214
The lyric is,
"Take away your things and go."

20:16.216 --> 20:17.715
"Take your things away
and go...

20:17.717 --> 20:19.550
"Take away your things
and go..."

20:19.552 --> 20:20.718
"Take away
your things and go."

20:20.720 --> 20:22.053
Yeah.
Yes.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.889
Good-bye, Jess.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.290
Good-bye, Sam.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.894
That's enough.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.068
WINSTON:
Wow.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.369
Powerful stuff.
(wry chuckle)

20:38.371 --> 20:40.671
But I think we both know
that it was for the best.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.672
(door shuts)

20:41.674 --> 20:42.740
Now, if you'll excuse me,

I've been dealing
with this all day

20:43.910 --> 20:46.010
