(fighting and screaming

00:02.127 --> 00:05.046
on video game)

00:05.088 --> 00:07.132
Pass the chips, please.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.759
Here you go.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.260
Thank you.

00:10.302 --> 00:12.137
You're welcome.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.431
Wow, that was

00:12.179 --> 00:14.431
a really great move.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.057
My head just went flying.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.267
Thank you.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.267
You're welcome.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.687
I told you boys

00:17.309 --> 00:19.687
these games are too violent.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.480
(screaming on game)

00:21.522 --> 00:23.732
Here, watch something

00:21.522 --> 00:23.732

$90 for a toy?

01:23.458 --> 01:25.627
It's not a toy.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.627
It's a robotics kit.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.047
You build a little

01:25.669 --> 01:28.047
mechanical rover.

01:28.087 --> 01:30.173
It teaches you about

01:28.087 --> 01:30.173
electronics and engineering.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.800
Does it teach you

01:30.215 --> 01:31.800
to pick up your socks?

01:31.842 --> 01:33.134
'Cause that I'd be

01:31.842 --> 01:33.134
interested in.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.511
HAL:

01:33.176 --> 01:34.511
Besides, son,

01:34.553 --> 01:36.972
robots are evil.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.972
What?!

01:37.014 --> 01:38.181
Westworld,

01:37.014 --> 01:38.181
Terminator,

01:38.223 --> 01:40.183
the creepy maid

01:38.223 --> 01:40.183
from  The Jetsons...

01:40.225 --> 01:42.143
how much scientific

01:40.225 --> 01:42.143
proof do you need?

01:42.185 --> 01:44.396
Mom!

01:42.185 --> 01:44.396
Malcolm, no!

01:44.438 --> 01:45.814
Look, if you want

01:44.438 --> 01:45.814
this thing so badly,

01:45.856 --> 01:47.816
you pay for it

01:45.856 --> 01:47.816
with your own money.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.818
You're gonna start babysitting

01:47.858 --> 01:49.818
next week, just save up.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.152
I don't even know

01:49.860 --> 01:51.152
what they're gonna pay me!

01:51.194 --> 01:52.738
I'll tell you what

01:51.194 --> 01:52.738
they're gonna pay you.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.364
They're gonna pay you

01:52.780 --> 01:54.364
what all jobs pay--

01:54.406 --> 01:56.033
less than you're worth

01:54.406 --> 01:56.033
and just enough to keep you

01:56.075 --> 01:58.243
crawling back for more.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.243
Now go on. It's bedtime.

01:58.285 --> 02:02.163
That's the way discussions

01:58.285 --> 02:02.163
go down in this family.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.041
I tell them my needs

02:02.205 --> 02:04.041
and they say no.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.085
Then dad reveals

02:04.083 --> 02:06.085
another cartoon character

02:06.126 --> 02:07.669
he's afraid of.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.213
(chuckles)

02:10.255 --> 02:13.174
Hey, how much time

02:10.255 --> 02:13.174
do you think we have?

02:13.216 --> 02:14.551
Not long enough

02:13.216 --> 02:14.551
for that look.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.344
(both laugh)

02:16.386 --> 02:18.179
You butt-wipe!

02:16.386 --> 02:18.179
That's my toothbrush.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.848
So use mine.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.224
You can't just take

02:19.890 --> 02:21.224
someone's toothbrush.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.601
Give me that.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.561
Fine.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.147
Oops.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.115
Hal... that is the third bug

02:33.528 --> 02:36.115
I've seen today.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.199
You have got to call

02:36.156 --> 02:38.199
the exterminator!

02:38.241 --> 02:41.202
What, and miss out

02:38.241 --> 02:41.202
on watching you hunt?

02:41.244 --> 02:44.414
You're like a sexy,

02:41.244 --> 02:44.414
bug-killing panther.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.207
(laughing)

02:46.249 --> 02:48.669
REESE:

02:46.249 --> 02:48.669
Malcolm, stop!

02:48.710 --> 02:51.296
(boys yelling)

02:51.338 --> 02:53.465
LOIS:

02:51.338 --> 02:53.465
That's it!

02:53.507 --> 02:55.216
Bedtime was

02:53.507 --> 02:55.216
20 minutes ago.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.510
Go to bed!

02:56.551 --> 02:57.594
Go to bed!

02:57.636 --> 02:58.971
(grunting)

02:59.972 --> 03:01.890
Bed!

03:04.267 --> 03:06.812
Hal, bring the spray!

03:06.854 --> 03:08.438
I haven't rinsed yet.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.816
Only boys who behave

03:08.480 --> 03:10.816
themselves get to rinse.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.943
Honestly, every night

03:10.858 --> 03:12.943
we go through this!

03:12.985 --> 03:14.736
Mom, can I have a story?

03:14.778 --> 03:16.488
Once upon a time

03:14.778 --> 03:16.488
there was a little boy

03:16.530 --> 03:17.906
who made his mother

03:16.530 --> 03:17.906
so crazy

03:17.948 --> 03:19.533
she decided to sell him

03:17.948 --> 03:19.533
to the circus.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.242
An evil circus?

03:21.284 --> 03:22.619
No, a nice one with monkeys.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.538
Thank you.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.538
Ah, wait, wait, wait, wait,

03:24.579 --> 03:27.541
I think I see

03:24.579 --> 03:27.541
where they're coming from.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.751
Ah, you cannot hide.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.253
Aw... look at...

03:32.295 --> 03:33.547
Aw!

03:35.507 --> 03:36.925
(insects munching)

03:36.967 --> 03:37.968
(grunts)

03:38.010 --> 03:40.470
(mumbling)

03:38.010 --> 03:40.470
Oh! Ooh!

03:40.512 --> 03:41.889
Oh!

03:41.930 --> 03:44.183
(Hal grunting)

03:44.224 --> 03:46.476
Aah! Aah! Just...

03:48.228 --> 03:49.980
Okay, come on, boys.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.314
We're all camping out

03:50.022 --> 03:51.314
in the den tonight.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.274
Here we go.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.902
Hey, Francis, aren't

03:53.316 --> 03:54.902
you going to open up

03:54.943 --> 03:56.195
your mom's care package?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.278
Give me a minute.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.989
I'm still savoring this.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.575
I swiped Commandant Spangler's

03:59.031 --> 04:01.575
master key.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.536
It opens every door

04:01.616 --> 04:04.536
in the academy, Stanley.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.287
Every door.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.581
You know, I think

04:06.329 --> 04:07.581
it's cookies.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.958
Who cares?

04:07.622 --> 04:09.958
I'm about to expose

04:10.000 --> 04:11.960
every secret sin

04:10.000 --> 04:11.960
this place conceals

04:12.002 --> 04:13.294
to the harsh light of day.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.296
So, can I open it?

04:15.338 --> 04:16.798
Yeah.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.592
(quiet laugh)

04:18.633 --> 04:21.720
So, what'd my mom send me?

04:21.762 --> 04:25.306
Bug-infested cookies.

04:25.348 --> 04:28.393
As usual, a mixed message.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.691
And this is the living room.

04:34.733 --> 04:39.154
This is the biggest, nicest

04:34.733 --> 04:39.154
house I've ever seen!

04:39.196 --> 04:42.116
Wow!

04:42.157 --> 04:45.119
Homocanthus imperator.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.327
We call him Barney.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.412
Malcolm?

04:47.454 --> 04:48.789
We saved you some dinner.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.958
Dinner? Me? Saved?

04:50.999 --> 04:53.334
Dinner?

04:53.376 --> 04:54.920
We weren't sure which

04:53.376 --> 04:54.920
you liked better--

04:54.962 --> 04:57.338
turkey or roast beef-- so

04:54.962 --> 04:57.338
we fixed you a platter.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.840
Platter?!

04:58.882 --> 05:00.634
Okay, kids,

04:58.882 --> 05:00.634
what time is it?

05:00.675 --> 05:03.344
Bedtime!

05:03.386 --> 05:04.345
Yay!

05:03.386 --> 05:04.345
I'll race you!

05:04.387 --> 05:05.513
They're going to bed?

05:05.555 --> 05:06.765
So you're just paying me

05:06.807 --> 05:08.058
to hang out here

05:06.807 --> 05:08.058
for three hours?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.977
Well, maybe three and a half.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.396
We'll round up to

05:10.018 --> 05:13.396
four, of course.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.356
Come on,

05:13.438 --> 05:15.356
there's got to be a catch!

05:15.398 --> 05:17.818
Oh, and Malcolm,

05:15.398 --> 05:17.818
you can't watch television...

05:17.859 --> 05:20.361
unless you turn on

05:17.859 --> 05:20.361
the satellite first.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.115
Otherwise, all you'll

05:20.403 --> 05:23.115
get is pornography.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.784
It's weird...

05:25.826 --> 05:27.452
I think I'm having a spasm.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.289
The muscles in my face

05:27.494 --> 05:30.289
keep pulling on my mouth.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.792
Oh, I think I'm happy!

05:33.834 --> 05:36.461
I just don't understand

05:33.834 --> 05:36.461
how it got so bad so fast.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.046
Well, it's been

05:36.503 --> 05:38.046
pretty hot this year.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.464
That's part of it, but, uh...

05:39.506 --> 05:41.967
mostly it's that giant

05:39.506 --> 05:41.967
pile of candy wrappers

05:42.009 --> 05:45.386
and half-eaten cereal boxes

05:42.009 --> 05:45.386
you have in your crawl space.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.473
It's like there's some kind of

05:45.428 --> 05:48.473
creepy hobo living down there.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.397
Whoa...

05:56.439 --> 05:58.399
there really

05:56.439 --> 05:58.399
is a lost bomb shelter.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.111
Wow, this is almost

05:58.441 --> 06:01.111
as exciting

06:01.153 --> 06:04.405
as that room full

06:01.153 --> 06:04.405
of folding chairs.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.407
Let's get out of here!

06:06.449 --> 06:08.409
Aw, come on, Francis.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.870
Don't you want to explore?

06:09.911 --> 06:11.705
We might find

06:09.911 --> 06:11.705
the abandoned furnace room

06:11.746 --> 06:13.498
or the old civil war amputorium.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.501
I didn't want to say this

06:13.540 --> 06:16.501
before, but you've confirmed it.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.005
Marlin Academy is the most

06:16.543 --> 06:20.005
boring place on earth.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.091
We're not gonna find

06:20.047 --> 06:23.091
anything interesting.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.718
(sighs)

06:27.262 --> 06:29.264
I take that back.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.431
Look, the circus!

06:30.473 --> 06:32.391
The circus is at our house!

06:34.311 --> 06:36.021
Well, say good-bye

06:34.311 --> 06:36.021
for a few days, boys.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.522
We're moving out.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.940
This is humiliating.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.442
Why can't we just stay

06:38.982 --> 06:41.442
at a nice hotel?

06:41.484 --> 06:42.443
Because we're giving all our

06:41.484 --> 06:42.443
money to the exterminators

06:42.485 --> 06:44.445
so they can stay in nice hotels.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.405
(sighs)

06:47.991 --> 06:49.450
Craig?

06:49.492 --> 06:51.452
Thank you so much

06:49.492 --> 06:51.452
for lending us your trailer.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.454
Oh, I'm just glad

06:51.494 --> 06:53.454
someone's finally

06:53.496 --> 06:54.915
getting some

06:53.496 --> 06:54.915
use out of it.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.833
I bought it 15 years ago

06:54.956 --> 06:56.833
to take on my honeymoon.

06:56.875 --> 06:57.751
You were married?

06:57.792 --> 06:59.460
No, I live on hope.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.922
Well... thanks again.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.423
You're welcome.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.219
Bye.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.517
Good-bye.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.488
Aw, this is cozy!

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
It's 150 degrees in here!

07:29.532 --> 07:30.491
My butt is sweating.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.493
Ah, it just needs

07:30.533 --> 07:32.493
to air out a little.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.495
The trailer!

07:34.537 --> 07:36.581
Come on, let's make

07:34.537 --> 07:36.581
the best of this.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.499
I'm going to go babysit.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.543
It's still early.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.543
They don't mind.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.379
They paying you okay?

07:42.421 --> 07:43.380
Yeah.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.756
It's okay.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.008
I can't believe how much

07:47.050 --> 07:49.010
these people are paying me!

07:49.052 --> 07:50.595
I did the math.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.807
I'm actually making more

07:50.637 --> 07:53.807
an hour than mom does.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.310
(sighing contentedly)

07:56.351 --> 07:57.811
I got to stop doing this.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.522
It's creepy, right?

08:01.564 --> 08:02.816
"Lester."

08:02.857 --> 08:05.986
Looks like he

08:02.857 --> 08:05.986
was the janitor.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.072
How long you think

08:06.027 --> 08:09.072
he's been down here?

08:11.825 --> 08:14.119
I'd say May of '85.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.996
You can tell that by tasting?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.164
No, the date on the newspaper.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.540
Then why did you lick him?

08:19.582 --> 08:22.377
How often do you get

08:19.582 --> 08:22.377
to taste a mummy?

08:22.419 --> 08:25.213
We should tell

08:22.419 --> 08:25.213
someone about him.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.631
Uh, no, you can't do that.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.175
Commandant will know

08:26.673 --> 08:28.175
you took the key,

08:28.216 --> 08:29.468
and he'll punish you.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.635
And then he'll punish me.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.846
And I'm gonna have

08:30.677 --> 08:32.846
to punish you.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.931
Yeah, but don't you think

08:32.887 --> 08:34.931
that's kind of sad?

08:34.973 --> 08:38.268
I mean, Lester's family will

08:34.973 --> 08:38.268
never know what happened to him.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.561
They probably still set a place

08:38.310 --> 08:40.561
for him on holidays.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.482
Yeah, well, judging by

08:40.603 --> 08:43.482
the empty scotch bottles

08:43.523 --> 08:47.068
and German dungeon porn,

08:43.523 --> 08:47.068
I don't think so.

08:47.110 --> 08:50.071
Damn. Beta.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.579
And you made fun of me

08:58.621 --> 09:00.748
when I bought

08:58.621 --> 09:00.748
this mesh underwear.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.584
Who looks like an idiot now?

09:03.626 --> 09:05.837
I stand corrected.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.589
Close the door.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.589
Were you raised in a barn?

09:08.631 --> 09:10.467
But it's cooler outside.

09:10.509 --> 09:11.510
Are you sure?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.635
Yeah.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.724
Well...

09:21.644 --> 09:24.439
(mumbling):

09:21.644 --> 09:24.439
I don't know.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.778
I don't know.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.324
Will you please

09:30.820 --> 09:34.324
make up your mind?

09:34.366 --> 09:36.617
There's no need

09:34.366 --> 09:36.617
for that kind of tone.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.245
It wasn't a tone.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.454
There it is again.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.206
Look, Hal, it's hot.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.623
We're all cranky.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.625
Will you please just drop it?

09:44.667 --> 09:46.503
Fine!

09:46.545 --> 09:49.297
I think

09:46.545 --> 09:49.297
you should apologize.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.425
Oh, you know, I didn't hear

09:49.339 --> 09:51.425
you apologizing to me

09:51.466 --> 09:53.468
when you used up all the

09:51.466 --> 09:53.468
liquid in the chemical toilet.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.053
Well, we have

09:53.510 --> 09:55.053
your taco casserole

09:55.095 --> 09:57.138
to thank for that, don't we?

09:57.180 --> 10:00.100
Boys, will you step

09:57.180 --> 10:00.100
outside for a second?

10:00.141 --> 10:03.311
Your father and I need

10:00.141 --> 10:03.311
a little privacy.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.939
Shoo!

10:05.980 --> 10:07.899
LOIS:

10:05.980 --> 10:07.899
Look, I didn't want to say

10:05.980 --> 10:07.899
anything in front of the boys.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.360
But you are behaving

10:07.941 --> 10:10.360
like a giant ass!

10:10.402 --> 10:12.028
HAL:

10:10.402 --> 10:12.028
Oh, really?

10:12.070 --> 10:15.240
Well, as long as we're

10:12.070 --> 10:15.240
on the subject of giant asses...

10:15.282 --> 10:17.658
I'm ready to go.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.453
Hey, you want

10:17.700 --> 10:19.453
to see something?

10:19.494 --> 10:21.662
That's okay; I don't

10:19.494 --> 10:21.662
want to break it.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.873
Ah, don't be silly.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.873
Come, take a look.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.669
Wow.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.921
That's a spiral galaxy.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.839
These people are amazing.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.675
They're rich, they're smart,

10:31.881 --> 10:34.675
they're polite.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.929
What are they gonna do next,

10:34.717 --> 10:37.929
give me a million dollars?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.556
Malcolm, do you want

10:37.971 --> 10:39.556
a million dollars?

10:39.598 --> 10:40.848
What?!

10:40.890 --> 10:43.684
I said, do you want

10:40.890 --> 10:43.684
a sandwich to take home?

10:43.726 --> 10:46.687
Oh. Close enough.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.148
I only asked out your sister

10:48.189 --> 10:49.690
because you said

10:48.189 --> 10:49.690
you weren't interested!

10:49.732 --> 10:51.692
And I was thinking of you

10:49.732 --> 10:51.692
the whole time!

10:51.734 --> 10:53.069
Aw, don't give me that!

10:53.111 --> 10:55.322
I saw the charm bracelet!

10:55.363 --> 10:56.490
This isn't even mine!

10:56.531 --> 10:58.699
What, are you insane?

10:58.741 --> 11:00.994
You're throwing out stuff

10:58.741 --> 11:00.994
that's not even mine!

11:04.747 --> 11:06.791
What are you looking at?

11:06.833 --> 11:09.503
Hey, this is a private

11:06.833 --> 11:09.503
conversation, buster!

11:09.544 --> 11:12.172
Huh?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.549
Oh, yeah, like you've

11:12.213 --> 11:14.549
never seen this before!

11:14.591 --> 11:16.717
(Hal yelling)

11:14.591 --> 11:16.717
My mistake.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.095
I'm on the next street over.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.597
(Lois and Hal arguing)

11:26.394 --> 11:27.728
You were right about Lester.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.728
I checked him out--

11:27.770 --> 11:29.772
no wife, no kids.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.733
Poor guy didn't have

11:29.814 --> 11:32.733
a friend in the world.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.986
(boys clamoring)

11:36.779 --> 11:38.739
Here you go,

11:36.779 --> 11:38.739
Lester, buddy.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.659
Did you tell anyone

11:38.781 --> 11:40.659
about this place?

11:40.699 --> 11:41.951
No.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.453
Huh.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.954
Must've been me, then.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.415
All right, that's enough!

11:47.457 --> 11:49.543
Party's over!

11:49.584 --> 11:51.336
Don't you guys have

11:49.584 --> 11:51.336
any respect for the dead?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.587
You took his wallet!

11:52.629 --> 11:54.755
Lester would've wanted me

11:52.629 --> 11:54.755
to have his I.D.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.757
But that's not the point.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.761
This man was not just

11:56.799 --> 12:00.761
an alcoholic pervert janitor.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.556
He was one of us!

12:02.597 --> 12:05.392
He hated the commandant

12:02.597 --> 12:05.392
as much as we do.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.768
He was filled

12:05.433 --> 12:07.768
with impudent rage, like we are.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.230
This man was a hero.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.483
And heroes do not rot alone

12:13.525 --> 12:15.443
in basements.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.196
They're immortalized in song.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.781
They were sent off to Valhalla

12:18.238 --> 12:20.781
in flaming ships!

12:20.823 --> 12:22.950
(boys clamor in agreement)

12:20.823 --> 12:22.950
They are not put

12:22.992 --> 12:26.246
in beer hats

12:22.992 --> 12:26.246
or used as photo props

12:26.287 --> 12:29.290
or given fake mustaches.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.292
(crunches, thumps)

12:29.332 --> 12:31.292
Oh, man!

12:31.334 --> 12:32.419
(rattling)

12:32.460 --> 12:34.795
(boys groaning)

12:34.837 --> 12:36.506
That wasn't fake.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.383
My bad.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.800
What do we do now?

12:39.842 --> 12:42.512
Go for the spare.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.182
Up higher, Dewey.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.182
Reese, vertical, vertical!

12:46.224 --> 12:47.684
I already adjusted...

12:46.224 --> 12:47.684
Go like this.

12:47.726 --> 12:48.727
I know, but this...

12:47.726 --> 12:48.727
Push the button harder.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.812
(all talking over one another)

12:51.854 --> 12:54.315
(screaming)

13:08.037 --> 13:10.540
(bubbling)

13:21.884 --> 13:24.137
Francis, I'm sorry

13:21.884 --> 13:24.137
I'm calling you so late.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.639
I had to talk to someone.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.682
Hey, no problem.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.682
What's going on?

13:27.724 --> 13:29.350
I don't know.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.646
Do you ever feel like you don't

13:29.392 --> 13:32.646
really belong in the family?

13:32.687 --> 13:33.854
Dude, I'm in military school.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.356
I think that question's

13:33.896 --> 13:35.356
been answered.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.484
Right.

13:37.525 --> 13:38.943
This is good.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.321
At least someone else

13:38.985 --> 13:41.321
in the family is normal.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.030
Hey, listen,

13:41.362 --> 13:43.030
while I got you, um...

13:43.072 --> 13:45.325
you're in school

13:43.072 --> 13:45.325
with all those science brains.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.951
How would you reattach a head

13:46.993 --> 13:49.496
to a dead body?

13:54.917 --> 13:56.586
(paper rustling)

13:56.628 --> 13:58.879
Keep it down!

13:56.628 --> 13:58.879
Huh?

13:58.921 --> 14:00.131
Don't talk to your

13:58.921 --> 14:00.131
mother like that!

14:00.173 --> 14:01.716
Would you go sit

14:00.173 --> 14:01.716
in the corner?

14:01.758 --> 14:04.177
There are no corners!

14:04.218 --> 14:07.806
You ready to make up?

14:07.846 --> 14:09.974
No.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.519
Me, neither.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.815
Oh, hello, son.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.066
You know, I barely

14:16.897 --> 14:19.066
see you anymore.

14:19.108 --> 14:22.069
That babysitting has turned

14:19.108 --> 14:22.069
into a full-time job.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.823
Well, sometimes I just

14:22.111 --> 14:24.823
go over there to hang out

14:24.864 --> 14:26.783
and watch TV.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.909
Live in a house.

14:28.951 --> 14:32.913
Dad, does this seem okay to you?

14:32.955 --> 14:34.915
Gosh, no.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.915
Your mother and I

14:34.957 --> 14:36.543
have never fought

14:34.957 --> 14:36.543
for this long before.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.919
It's been days, and we

14:36.584 --> 14:38.919
still haven't made up.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.921
I don't even know

14:38.961 --> 14:40.921
what the problem is.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.924
Nah, something's missing.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.926
Boy...

14:45.968 --> 14:47.928
look at that sky, Malcolm.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.014
Just think,

14:50.056 --> 14:54.853
somewhere out there

14:50.056 --> 14:54.853
in all those stars and planets,

14:54.894 --> 14:58.147
there might be

14:54.894 --> 14:58.147
at this very moment

14:58.189 --> 15:01.735
a space dad

14:58.189 --> 15:01.735
who just got kicked out

15:01.776 --> 15:03.653
of his space trailer,

15:03.695 --> 15:05.363
who's looking down at us.

15:05.405 --> 15:09.033
Or would it be up at us?

15:09.075 --> 15:11.578
Or maybe sideways?

15:11.619 --> 15:15.164
Trust me, Dad.

15:11.619 --> 15:15.164
They're all looking down on us.

15:16.457 --> 15:17.958
The matinee

15:16.457 --> 15:17.958
gets out at 4:00,

15:18.000 --> 15:19.836
so we should be back

15:18.000 --> 15:19.836
before dinner.

15:19.878 --> 15:22.839
Okay. What do you want me

15:19.878 --> 15:22.839
to feed the kids for lunch?

15:22.881 --> 15:23.964
Hmm, whatever you want.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.007
We trust you.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.967
They trust me!

15:27.009 --> 15:28.969
People like this trust me!

15:29.011 --> 15:30.971
I obviously have to say

15:29.011 --> 15:30.971
something nice back to them.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.973
This is why my family sucks.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.851
I have no training in this.

15:34.893 --> 15:38.354
This job...

15:38.396 --> 15:40.981
me... like.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.983
We're thrilled to have

15:41.023 --> 15:42.983
found you, Malcolm.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.985
The kids love you.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.613
You're great

15:45.027 --> 15:46.613
to have around.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.948
You've really become

15:46.654 --> 15:48.948
one of the family.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.872
I may not have been

15:53.828 --> 15:55.872
switched at birth,

15:55.914 --> 15:57.039
but I should have been.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.958
I love these people.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.712
(speaking Chinese)

16:49.091 --> 16:50.551
Okay, come on.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.015
Wait a minute.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.062
Sorry.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.523
Well...

17:03.564 --> 17:07.610
let's see what our

17:03.564 --> 17:07.610
little friend did today.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.574
(whistling)

17:19.622 --> 17:21.624
(blender whirs)

17:23.710 --> 17:25.712
(continues whistling)

17:47.567 --> 17:49.027
Oh, hi.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.110
Don't worry.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.320
I'd never hurt Barney.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.113
He's part of the family.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.115
Just like I'm part

17:53.155 --> 17:55.115
of the family, right?

17:55.157 --> 17:56.701
And since a big part

17:55.157 --> 17:56.701
of this family

17:56.743 --> 17:58.118
is being such a huge phony

17:58.160 --> 17:59.746
and launching

17:58.160 --> 17:59.746
secret investigations

17:59.787 --> 18:00.830
against each other,

18:00.872 --> 18:02.040
I thought I'd join in.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.166
Personal computers

18:02.081 --> 18:04.166
are great.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.420
You can file tax returns,

18:04.208 --> 18:07.420
medical records,

18:07.461 --> 18:09.129
embarrassing private e-mail.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.131
Little security tip,

18:09.171 --> 18:11.131
though.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.759
Never use your birthday

18:12.800 --> 18:14.969
as your password.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.846
And hiding things

18:15.011 --> 18:16.846
in a fake salt can?

18:16.888 --> 18:19.139
That's just silly.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.600
I don't know who Melissa is,

18:20.641 --> 18:22.602
but she sure wears

18:20.641 --> 18:22.602
a lot of lipstick.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.145
Anyway, I think

18:22.643 --> 18:25.145
I hear you guys

18:25.187 --> 18:26.439
pulling up in the driveway.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.982
So let's just leave it at this:

18:28.024 --> 18:29.067
I quit.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.234
Bye.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.782
Who's Melissa?

18:38.785 --> 18:41.328
(arguing in trailer)

18:41.370 --> 18:43.456
Hi, son.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.456
Didn't hear you drive up.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.207
I decided to walk.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.627
So, how's the job going?

18:47.668 --> 18:49.211
They were jerks, so I quit.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.672
Well, that's pretty much

18:49.253 --> 18:51.672
what work is.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.132
Welcome to the club.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.175
Dad?

18:55.217 --> 18:56.260
Hmm?

18:56.302 --> 18:57.470
I'm really sorry.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.472
What? About quitting?

18:59.513 --> 19:03.101
Ah... no big deal,

18:59.513 --> 19:03.101
especially for you.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.561
Malcolm, you should set

19:03.142 --> 19:05.561
your sights as high as you can.

19:05.603 --> 19:09.189
If anyone in this family has

19:05.603 --> 19:09.189
a shot at greatness, it's you.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.567
Just, uh... do me a favor, huh?

19:11.609 --> 19:13.069
Look after your brothers?

19:13.111 --> 19:14.236
Okay, wait, wait.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.447
You mean everything

19:14.278 --> 19:16.447
you just said, right?

19:16.489 --> 19:18.825
Why would I say something

19:16.489 --> 19:18.825
I didn't mean?

19:18.866 --> 19:20.827
See? That's what

19:18.866 --> 19:20.827
I'm talking about.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.370
This family may be

19:20.868 --> 19:23.370
rude, loud and gross

19:23.412 --> 19:25.456
and have no shame

19:23.412 --> 19:25.456
whatsoever.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.374
Anyway, with them

19:27.416 --> 19:30.128
you know where you stand,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.212
and when I have a problem,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.212
they're always there.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.297
Oh, my Lord.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.215
(drops dish)

19:33.339 --> 19:35.215
Sex!

19:36.258 --> 19:37.217
(car door closes)

19:37.259 --> 19:38.678
(engine starts)

19:38.719 --> 19:40.847
(tires screeching)

19:40.888 --> 19:43.141
Things didn't work out so bad.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.268
I made enough money

19:43.182 --> 19:46.268
to get my robotics kit.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.147
Or maybe I should do

19:46.310 --> 19:49.147
something nice for my family.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.397
Take them to dinner...

19:50.439 --> 19:52.191
treat them to a movie.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.444
Naw, then I couldn't do this.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.071
LOIS: If you don't

19:55.486 --> 19:57.071
change your underwear,

19:57.113 --> 19:58.322
this is exactly

19:57.113 --> 19:58.322
what happens.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.241
Like the ancient civilizations

19:58.364 --> 20:01.241
before us,

20:01.283 --> 20:04.078
we send off this noble man

20:01.283 --> 20:04.078
with the riches he had in life

20:04.120 --> 20:07.206
so he may enjoy them

20:04.120 --> 20:07.206
in the afterlife.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.673
Farewell, noble Lester.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.554
It's burning really fast.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.264
How much gas did you use?

20:24.306 --> 20:25.307
Half a can.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.854
Where'd you put the can?

20:29.896 --> 20:31.731
(explosion)

20:31.772 --> 20:33.774
Oh.

20:33.816 --> 20:34.901
Look.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.318
It's heading

20:34.942 --> 20:36.318
toward the boathouse.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.237
(explosion)

20:42.241 --> 20:43.993
What do you think?

20:44.035 --> 20:45.745
Run?

20:45.786 --> 20:47.246
Yeah. I'd run.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.839
(door opening)

20:58.340 --> 20:59.550
I figured it out.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.968
Hal, you okay?

21:01.010 --> 21:02.553
Yeah, shh, shh, shh.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.598
Whenever we'd fight,

21:02.595 --> 21:05.598
you'd yell, then I'd yell,

21:05.639 --> 21:07.600
but then we would...

21:05.639 --> 21:07.600
you know.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.518
Well, you see,

21:07.641 --> 21:09.518
we haven't had a chance to

21:09.560 --> 21:11.938
because we're in a trailer

21:09.560 --> 21:11.938
with kids and we can't...

21:11.979 --> 21:14.232
Oh, my God, Hal,

21:11.979 --> 21:14.232
you're right.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.316
What are we going to do?

21:14.314 --> 21:16.316
We got the kids...

21:16.358 --> 21:18.236
No, n-no, I got it

21:16.358 --> 21:18.236
all figured out.

21:37.421 --> 21:41.508
♪ La, la, la, la,
