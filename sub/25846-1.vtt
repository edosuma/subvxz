WEBVTT

01:22.920 --> 01:23.920
Three euro.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.235
Two. I'll give it for two.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.070
One-fifty?

03:09.240 --> 03:12.119
Morgan, you're such a fucking freak.
I love you.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.715
- I love you.
- Where'd you steal that microphone from?

03:14.840 --> 03:17.196
<i>Audrey, you know me.
You know that I own microphones.</i>

03:21.160 --> 03:22.560
Fuck me. Tess is here.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.559
Oh, my God. The audacity.

03:28.640 --> 03:31.200
- Morgan...
- The sheer hubris

03:31.280 --> 03:32.680
to show up here at your birthday.

03:32.760 --> 03:33.591
Morgan...

03:33.680 --> 03:36.434
There was a minimum number of people
in order to reserve the bar.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.273
- Morgan...
- I'm so sorry. Oh, my God.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.159
I didn't think she would come.
Oh, she's ordering a custom cocktail.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.509
I'm gonna kill myself.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.035
What do I say? Huh? Like,

03:45.160 --> 03:46.736
"My boyfriend dumped me
in a text message."

03:46.760 --> 03:47.796
How do I explain that?

03:47.880 --> 03:50.714
I know. There's a simple solution.
It's called lying.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.156
No. No, I'm a really bad liar.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.320
I know, 'cause you ramble.
You give too many details.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.176
And then people know that you're lying.
You have to be concise about it.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.840
Here, ask me what I've been up to lately.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.714
Um, what have you been up to?

04:01.800 --> 04:03.678
I bought a boat. And we're out.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.717
Oh, my God. She's coming over here.
I'm with you.

04:05.800 --> 04:06.800
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.120
Hey, ladies.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.954
- I can't do this.
- Oh, you're fucking dead to me.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.509
- Happy birthday.
- Hey, girl.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.238
Where's your adorable boyfriend?

04:17.360 --> 04:19.430
You know, you guys make
such a surprising couple.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.110
Like, if I didn't meet him
as your boyfriend,

04:22.240 --> 04:24.709
I would assume he'd be dating
someone more...

04:24.800 --> 04:28.999
Like, edgy. Like a cool girl.
Like a model.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.238
But then I see you two together,
and it's like, "Aw, this works, too."

04:33.240 --> 04:34.754
Where is he? So I can hug him.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.680
Okay.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.959
Oh, God. Oh, come on.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.829
This is crazy because
you're from the Ukraine...

05:30.920 --> 05:32.479
- Uh-huh.
- ...and I just auditioned

05:32.600 --> 05:35.832
to be a Ukrainian farm girl in a GEICO ad.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.751
And?

05:36.840 --> 05:39.071
They told me I was too authentic.
Anyway...

05:39.560 --> 05:41.711
Is it Ukraine or the Ukraine?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.269
Well, it depends.
You say how you like, you know?

05:44.360 --> 05:47.080
Always let beautiful, sexy woman decide.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.759
Okay.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.910
That's what this is?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.116
- You know...
- All right.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.953
...you have face like doll.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.514
Mmm. Okay.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.956
Such a small, narrow waist. It's tiny.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.440
You know, I was gonna drive home,

05:58.520 --> 06:01.194
but now I think
I might just drive into a wall.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.074
Hit me.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.836
Wait, I can use this.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.639
Come here. Audrey?

06:07.760 --> 06:08.876
- Yeah?
- This is Viktor.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.360
He's a visitor from Eastern Europe.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.176
He has something
that he wants to say to you.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.200
- I do?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.675
This is my best friend.
She's having a bad night.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.195
Can you just use
your aggressive masculinity

06:18.280 --> 06:21.830
for good instead of for evil,
and just tell her what you told me before?

06:21.920 --> 06:22.797
What are you doing?

06:22.880 --> 06:25.600
You have doll face.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.355
No, make it specific to her.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.079
Like really objectify her.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.077
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.032
Okay, cool. Uh...

06:32.160 --> 06:34.231
You have big baby eyes.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.356
Mmm.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.318
And, phew, soft...

06:37.400 --> 06:39.039
...supple udders.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.236
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.357
- Oh, my God! What the fuck?
- Wow!

06:42.440 --> 06:43.480
Thank you so much, Viktor.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.800
- You've done good work.
- Okay.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.280
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, bye-bye.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.800
I fucking hate you.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.872
Oh, come on. You're smiling.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.176
Hey, Audrey. Where's Drew?

06:51.200 --> 06:52.031
He drowned.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.271
Ugh. Do you see?
This has been all night long.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.589
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.319
- You have to move on.
- Yes, I know.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.993
It's just really hard to do that

06:59.080 --> 07:00.776
when he left a box of his shit
in our apartment,

07:00.800 --> 07:02.917
and he won't even text me back
about picking it up.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.992
I know. Oh, can I see your phone?

07:05.080 --> 07:05.957
Yeah.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.320
I just have to Google something.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.750
Whew.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.712
Who are you texting?

07:18.800 --> 07:21.360
Morgan, let me see my phone.
Let me see my phone.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.656
- I'm texting Drew.
- Oh, my God.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.593
I said, "Fuck you, you worthless nutsack.
I'm setting your shit on fire."

07:25.680 --> 07:27.273
Oh, my God, no.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.752
Why the fuck would you write that?

07:29.840 --> 07:31.440
'Cause we're gonna set his shit on fire.

07:45.920 --> 07:46.920
Fuck!

07:52.720 --> 07:53.995
Really, Drew?

07:54.760 --> 07:57.116
Skid marks on your underwear?

07:57.200 --> 07:59.795
What are you, eight?
Did he want me to wash them?

07:59.880 --> 08:02.256
Is that why he broke up with me?
'Cause I didn't mother him enough?

08:02.280 --> 08:03.839
Fuck you. Wipe your own ass.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.510
Okay. Oh, what's this?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.195
Oh.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.476
This is actually a handwritten list

08:10.560 --> 08:13.155
of his favorite breakfast
burrito places in Los Angeles.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.038
Stop. He made notes.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.874
- Yep.
- "Great egg to tortilla ratio."

08:17.960 --> 08:19.110
Fuckin' idiot.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.976
- Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!
- Burn the fire.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.912
Oh, my God! His trophy.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.834
Second place trophy, fantasy football.
And he saved it.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.516
No! It's not even real football.
It's a fucking fantasy!

08:29.600 --> 08:32.115
Oh, wait.

08:33.919 --> 08:34.919
Oh, my God. It's Drew.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.114
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.316
Really? That's it? "Hey"?

08:48.400 --> 08:51.120
Are your ears burning?
'Cause your shit is.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.752
I'm sorry. I fucked up, okay?

08:53.840 --> 08:54.876
<i>Hold on. What?</i>

08:55.680 --> 08:58.479
What do you mean, you fucked up?
Which part?

08:58.600 --> 09:01.416
I'm gonna come over tomorrow,
and I'm going to explain everything, okay?

09:01.440 --> 09:03.056
Just, please don't do anything
with my stuff.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.840
I'll be back tomorrow.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.711
Drew?

09:10.240 --> 09:11.240
Drew.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.471
- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

10:09.640 --> 10:10.640
Happy birthday.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.200
How...

10:14.280 --> 10:15.396
- Yep.
- The... Yeah.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.915
- Uh, it's not my birthday.
- Oh.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.280
I just kinda wear it for warmth.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.034
Well, if it was your birthday,
I would say, um...

10:23.680 --> 10:24.875
"Happy birthday."

10:24.960 --> 10:27.031
- Well, I'd probably say, "Thank you."
- Well...

10:27.800 --> 10:28.800
you're welcome.

10:29.920 --> 10:30.920
Hey.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.280
I got a quarter left.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.553
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

10:37.320 --> 10:41.280
is to find the absolute
worst song on the jukebox.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.120
Okay.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
One gum, please.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.400
Oh.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.080
Yeah.

11:05.800 --> 11:06.631
Um...

11:06.720 --> 11:07.915
$2.25.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.430
Have a great day.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.760
Aren't you gonna ask me
if I need help to my car?

11:26.840 --> 11:27.910
So, um...

11:28.840 --> 11:29.840
Where are you from?

11:30.360 --> 11:32.113
Uh... England.

11:32.680 --> 11:33.796
That's what I thought.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.072
Yeah, but sometimes when I think that
people end up being Australian.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.994
Ah. People do sometimes end up
being Australian.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.639
Shut up.

11:42.520 --> 11:46.230
Oh, God. I don't actually mean "shut up."
It's a figure of speech.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.357
I don't know if you do that in England.

11:48.440 --> 11:49.760
What? Figures of speech?

11:50.240 --> 11:51.594
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We invented that.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.440
Right.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.558
You know, some...

11:59.320 --> 12:01.630
Some might say that I'm not
exercising good judgment

12:01.720 --> 12:03.279
following a strange man somewhere.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.554
This is how people get shoved
in the back of sketchy vans, right?

12:08.680 --> 12:10.160
That makes this rather awkward.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.240
Mmm.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
Get in the van.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.040
What?

12:18.800 --> 12:19.816
Oh, my God.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.797
Okay, what is happening?

12:21.880 --> 12:23.536
Did I do something wrong? Am I in trouble?

12:23.560 --> 12:26.394
Listen, we just wanna talk
about Drew Thayer.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.675
He's your boyfriend, right?

12:27.760 --> 12:31.310
No. I mean, yes. Well,
he was my boyfriend, but we broke up.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.400
Why? Is he in trouble?

12:32.480 --> 12:35.791
Yes. Drew is in a lot of trouble.
That's why you're in a van.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.161
Do you know where your ex-boyfriend
worked, Miss Stockman?

12:38.480 --> 12:40.392
Uh, yeah. NPR.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.870
He had a podcast. It was about, um...

12:42.960 --> 12:48.433
I'm not 100% sure what it was about,
but like jazz and economics.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.360
Okay, nobody listened
to that podcast.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.920
Not even me, and I went to Harvard.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.474
Wow. Only took you two minutes.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.711
Well, I had to give her that
for context, Seb.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.511
That podcast was Drew's cover job.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.832
Well, Drew never mentioned
having another job.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.230
Listen, Drew was CIA.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.560
I'm sorry. What?

13:13.280 --> 13:14.873
Oh, my God.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.477
You were in Vegas when we saw Celine Dion?

13:18.560 --> 13:20.472
Ironically. Oh, my God.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.155
Listen, Drew's gone missing.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.636
A lot of innocent people
are gonna die unless we find him.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.074
Has he been in contact with you?

13:30.200 --> 13:31.111
No.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
Are you sure?

13:32.280 --> 13:33.509
Mmm-mmm. No.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.037
Oh, unless it was
last Tuesday night,

13:36.120 --> 13:39.096
'cause I dropped my phone in the tub
and it stopped working for a little while.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.296
That's... Yep, that's what happened.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.074
So I went on the Internet,
and I was like, "How do I fix my phone?"

13:43.160 --> 13:46.756
It said to put it in a bag of rice,
so I was like, "I don't have rice."

13:46.840 --> 13:48.274
Okay. You do not wanna lie to us.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.313
Okay. Okay, fine.
Yes, he called me last night.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.357
Well, I guess he called me back. Finally.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.437
I called him, like, a thousand times.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.796
Just this week,
after I stopped hearing from him.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.161
I called him, like,
a normal amount when we were together.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.280
I'm normal.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.680
Okay.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.856
Oh, my God. I love you, Mom.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.837
Morgan. Morgan, I need to talk to you.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.274
Oh, wait. Audrey just got home.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.635
I need to talk to you.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.996
I need to talk to you.
Viktor is in my room right now.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.376
I don't know who the fuck that is.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.976
Viktor, the guy from the bar last night.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.913
Turns out I left my driver's license.
He sent me a Facebook message.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.760
And then he sent me
two pictures of his dick.

14:27.840 --> 14:28.751
Okay. I don't... I don't really...

14:28.840 --> 14:30.936
I know, I don't wanna reward
that kind of behavior either,

14:30.960 --> 14:33.336
but I needed my driver's license back.
I'm not gonna go to the DMV.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.191
I mean, kill me.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.376
Totally. Can we just...
I just need to tell you something.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.074
But I'm using this opportunity
to teach him about feminism.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.437
There he is. Hey.
You remember Audrey from last night?

14:42.520 --> 14:44.000
Yeah. You know, Audrey,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.959
"There is no limit
to what we women can achieve."

14:48.600 --> 14:49.670
Michelle Obama.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.593
Okay. I take shower.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.680
Okay.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.193
He's doing very well. One second.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.875
Mom, did you get the dick pics
that I forwarded you?

15:00.000 --> 15:00.911
- Morgan.
- What?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.435
Audrey thinks it's weird
that we tell each other everything.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.096
I think it's... I know.
Of course, it's normal.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.079
Yes! That's what I said.
It looks like an unbaked crescent roll.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.117
No, I know you like them uncut.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.376
Wait, hold on. My mom wants to know

15:11.400 --> 15:13.176
if you've ever been with
an uncircumcised guy?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.576
Oh, my God. Morgan, I'm begging you.
Get off the fucking phone!

15:15.600 --> 15:17.240
Okay, I love you. I'll talk to you later.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.040
What?

15:20.240 --> 15:24.280
Get this. Two guys show up at my work
from the CIA.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.559
They wanna talk about Drew.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.720
They said he's a spy.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.314
What do you mean, a spy?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.193
Morgan, I'm serious.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.990
They showed me photos of him
with, like, dead bodies

15:39.080 --> 15:41.197
and, like, weapons and blood.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.536
- Wait, wait. What? What?
- I know.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.120
I know this sounds batshit crazy,
but just think about it, okay?

15:45.200 --> 15:47.795
There were so many unanswered
questions about that guy.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.320
Like if he went to Vassar,
why does he pronounce it "liberry"?

15:50.360 --> 15:52.397
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

15:56.000 --> 15:57.719
Sorry.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.717
Couldn't remember if you were 3-A or 3-B.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.310
- Hey.
- What?

16:02.880 --> 16:05.156
I'm not great on text.
I'm better on email.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.276
You know that. I'm...

16:08.040 --> 16:09.520
Why does it smell like lighter fluid?

16:09.560 --> 16:12.496
Because I wasn't kidding when I told you
I was gonna set your shit on fire.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.715
Look, listen, I get it.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.197
It's a long story.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.272
There was something
that I had to deal with, okay?

16:17.360 --> 16:18.874
I just wasn't in the right headspace.

16:19.920 --> 16:20.990
I know you're a spy.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.800
Yeah.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.996
These guys showed up at my work,
shoved me into a van,

16:28.080 --> 16:29.992
and showed me these horrible photos.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.270
Where...

16:32.360 --> 16:33.816
- What did you tell 'em?
- What do you mean,

16:33.840 --> 16:35.616
"What did I tell them?"
You're not gonna deny to it?

16:35.640 --> 16:37.871
Or tell me those photos
were photoshopped or anything?

16:37.960 --> 16:40.156
Oh, my God. You have a fucking gun!

16:40.240 --> 16:42.160
I need you to tell me
exactly what you told them.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.879
Wait, is this why you broke up with me?

16:45.880 --> 16:46.711
What's on your forehead?

16:46.800 --> 16:47.836
What?

16:47.920 --> 16:49.976
You have, like,
this little red dot on your forehead.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.434
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

16:51.920 --> 16:53.320
Go, go, go!

16:53.400 --> 16:55.392
Stay down!

16:55.480 --> 16:56.914
Go! Go!

16:57.360 --> 16:59.795
Stay down! Stay away from the windows!

16:59.880 --> 17:01.314
Dad, I have to call you back.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.997
What the fuck is going on?
Morgan!

17:09.280 --> 17:10.474
Wait, you're bleeding.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.314
Fuck!

17:12.400 --> 17:14.118
Some bad people are after me.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.200
The CIA?

17:15.240 --> 17:17.675
And some other people, too.
And now they're after you.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.356
- It's exactly why I left you.
- Oh, my God.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.589
I didn't want you in danger.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.554
It's also why I left you this.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.438
- Your trophy?
- Because I trust you.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.632
A lot of innocent people are gonna die

17:31.720 --> 17:34.235
unless we get this
to where it needs to go, okay?

17:34.320 --> 17:36.536
So what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna leave the apartment.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.916
We're gonna go to Vienna. Okay?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.231
And we're gonna go to Cafe Schiele.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.790
We're gonna meet someone named Verne
at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.136
Wait. Why are you telling me this
if we're doing this together?

17:48.160 --> 17:50.720
In case I don't make it outta here alive.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.638
No, Drew, you're not gonna die.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.720
Listen to me.

17:54.760 --> 17:58.197
11:00 a.m. Cafe Schiele. Verne.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.478
- You got it?
- Okay, got it.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.751
And don't trust anybody.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.069
Anybody.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.640
<i>Do svidanya,</i> Drew.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.070
Oh, my God!

18:20.960 --> 18:22.280
Oh, my God! Drew's dead.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.760
Open up!

18:24.280 --> 18:26.351
Fire escape! Fire escape.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.120
Open up now!
We got a search warrant!

18:32.320 --> 18:33.674
Hallway clear!

18:33.760 --> 18:35.080
Door right.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.480
Clear!

18:36.560 --> 18:37.560
Check it!

18:43.480 --> 18:44.675
- Are you okay?
- What?

18:45.400 --> 18:47.119
No! Are you?

18:48.560 --> 18:49.914
- No. Okay.
- Okay.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.919
So, um, where are we going?

18:53.160 --> 18:54.958
I don't know. Where are we gonna be safe?

18:55.320 --> 18:58.040
Pull into that parking lot.
There's a bathroom in that Pilates Plus.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.840
We are not hiding
in a fucking Pilates Plus.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.195
Where's the police station?

19:02.280 --> 19:03.396
What? No. No police.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.314
No police. We're not doing police
'cause I killed someone.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.629
Oh, my God!

19:07.720 --> 19:09.040
Call the CIA guys.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.875
No! Drew said that we can't trust anyone,
and he's right, 'cause he's dead.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.272
Probably because I talked to them.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.636
No, it's 'cause I let the assassin
into the apartment.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.376
Okay, fair enough. It's both our faults.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.360
Shit.

19:23.880 --> 19:24.950
You gonna get the call?

19:25.040 --> 19:26.040
Hello.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.600
<i>Audrey, it's Sebastian.</i>

19:27.640 --> 19:28.790
You killed Drew.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.954
I told you where he was gonna be,
and you fucking killed him!

19:32.040 --> 19:33.456
Sorry, can I ask a question? Who is this?

19:33.480 --> 19:34.760
That's the asshole from the CIA.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.376
<i>Audrey,
where are you taking it?</i>

19:36.400 --> 19:37.959
Why would I tell you?

19:38.040 --> 19:40.316
<i>Give us the package. Trust me.</i>

19:40.880 --> 19:42.394
I don't trust anyone anymore.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.800
You trust me though, right?

19:46.520 --> 19:48.637
Yes, of course, I trust you.
You don't count.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.030
Good. 'Cause this is not some
fake spy friendship

19:51.120 --> 19:52.395
that the Russians put together.

19:52.480 --> 19:53.994
Dude, shut up. I know.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.136
Okay, Drew said that if
we don't deliver this package,

19:56.160 --> 19:57.435
a lot of people are gonna die.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.399
What if we don't do it and then there's
a terrorist attack or something?

20:00.800 --> 20:02.120
Well, what did he say to do?

20:02.200 --> 20:04.192
We have to get it to a cafe in Vienna.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.435
Austria, Vienna?

20:06.520 --> 20:07.351
Yes. That's what he said.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.960
Okay. Well, why don't we do that then?

20:10.200 --> 20:13.193
Do what? Go to Europe when
a bunch of people are trying to kill us?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.112
Do you wanna die
having never been to Europe?

20:15.880 --> 20:18.554
Or do you wanna go to Europe
and die having been to Europe?

20:19.560 --> 20:21.711
Why are those my only two options?

20:23.120 --> 20:24.634
Okay. This is a sign.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.474
Our passports are still in there
from our road trip to Tijuana.

20:29.600 --> 20:34.072
Okay, someone that you love just died
and asked you to do one last thing.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.200
I think you gotta do it.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.320
I'll go with you.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.790
Okay, fuck it. Let's just...
Let's go to Austria.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.916
Let's go to Austria.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.296
- Why are you turning?
- I have to park.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.240
People are trying to kill us.
We're not fucking parking in Lot C.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.640
<i>We need a suitcase.</i>

20:57.680 --> 21:00.514
I think it looks suspicious
if we go through international security

21:00.600 --> 21:02.440
with no luggage
and just a weird trophy, right?

21:02.520 --> 21:05.638
Wait. Wouldn't it be more suspicious
if we go through security with a suitcase

21:05.720 --> 21:07.712
that's totally empty
except for the weird trophy?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.871
Yes. We need more trophies then.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.155
That's what we'll do.

21:11.240 --> 21:14.278
We'll be the kind of women who jet off
to Vienna with all of our awards.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.398
We're notable. We're recognized.
We have trophies, baby!

21:18.360 --> 21:19.360
"Best Grandson"?

21:20.160 --> 21:21.160
Yes.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.556
Don't be nervous.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.836
People get caught
when they're not confident.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.239
Hello, are you new?
I usually deal with Cesar.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.072
Shit.
We gotta get rid of our phones.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.038
Bad guys can track us even if they're off.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.191
Oh, right. I've actually
known that for a long time.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.280
I went to performing arts camp
with Edward Snowden.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.856
Oh, that's right.
You used to date Snowden.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.678
No, no. He tried.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.194
God, he was obsessed with me.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.520
He was really into ska.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.216
When the whole thing was going down,
I was like,

21:46.240 --> 21:49.016
"Why is no one talking about the fact
that Edward Snowden's really into ska?"

21:49.040 --> 21:50.633
- Give me your phone.
- Oh, yeah.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.075
<i>Final call for boarding Flight 232.</i>

21:55.680 --> 21:57.194
<i>Final call for boarding Flight 232.</i>

21:57.280 --> 21:58.280
Bitch!

21:58.360 --> 21:59.510
Oh.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.198
Bitch!

22:11.120 --> 22:13.715
<i>- Mambo No. 5?</i>
- Oh, please.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.696
- What?
- Have you heard mambos one through four?

22:15.720 --> 22:17.120
- They're fantastic. Yeah.
- Wow.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.429
That's good. That's good.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.318
Oh, I got one. Close your eyes.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.516
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.320
Oh. Um...

22:36.200 --> 22:37.316
No. Uh...

22:51.240 --> 22:52.336
Yeah, that's the worst song.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.079
- You win.
- Right?

22:54.160 --> 22:55.296
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.151
- That's the worst.
- Thank you.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.516
They play this kind of stuff in Europe
all the time.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.200
It's like the whole continent just said,

23:00.240 --> 23:02.550
"You know what? I love 1994.
Let's just stay here."

23:04.360 --> 23:06.040
I wouldn't know.
I've never been to Europe.

23:24.840 --> 23:25.840
Oh!

23:26.680 --> 23:27.920
For our special today,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.515
I would recommend
our meat and bread platter

23:30.600 --> 23:32.273
with a hot pot of fondue.

23:32.360 --> 23:34.397
This is really fancy.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.675
We belong here.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.760
Was this a place that Drew
would hang out at?

23:39.840 --> 23:41.479
I mean, Drew. Like...

23:41.560 --> 23:46.112
The same guy that called
7-Eleven sushi Japanese food.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.634
Okay. Who do we think Verne is?

23:49.880 --> 23:50.950
I don't know.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.997
And won't Verne be looking for Drew?

23:54.640 --> 23:56.438
- Fuck.
- How's he gonna know it's us?

23:57.120 --> 23:58.520
God damn it! What do we do?

24:00.960 --> 24:03.680
Oh, no. What's wrong? What do you see?

24:05.200 --> 24:08.238
Oh, nothing, nothing.
It's just that, um,

24:08.320 --> 24:10.994
cake's a lot of flour and dairy
for me. I...

24:11.920 --> 24:12.920
I have to have diarrhea.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.234
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.434
Morgan, you should...
You should probably go.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.357
I can hold it.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.075
No. Mmm. You should probably not do that.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.400
No. No, this is more important.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.875
No. Oh, my gosh.
It's really not. Please go.

24:27.960 --> 24:28.960
Okay.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.274
Can I bring you anything else?

24:37.360 --> 24:38.635
Uh, no.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.598
Don't make a noise.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.954
I'm the person you're here to meet.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.436
I'm sorry. Um, you're Verne?

24:47.520 --> 24:49.477
It's an alias. Now, hand the package over.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.791
Wait.
None of this is making any sense.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.231
Oh, my God.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.320
Don't say a word.

24:56.440 --> 24:58.193
Okay. Oh, my God.

25:02.520 --> 25:03.715
I'm trying to protect you.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.439
Yeah. The same way you protected Drew?

25:05.520 --> 25:08.399
If you were here to protect me,
you wouldn't be pointing a gun at me.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.392
I may not be in the CIA,
but I know that much.

25:10.480 --> 25:12.392
MI6, actually. Drew was CIA.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.709
It's an international effort.

25:14.440 --> 25:15.440
Whatever!

25:26.920 --> 25:27.990
You're Verne?

25:28.080 --> 25:29.150
<i>Guten Morgen.</i>

25:32.120 --> 25:33.236
<i>Guten</i> Verne.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.376
Would you please stop pointing that?
It's making me very nervous.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.896
- When I get nervous...
- Sit still and listen.

25:38.920 --> 25:39.956
Okay.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.836
In a moment, everyone in this cafe
is gonna start shooting.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.600
They all want what you've got,

25:45.080 --> 25:47.440
and they'll kill each and every one of us
until they get it.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.314
If you run, you'll be killed.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.360
If you do manage to get out,
you won't be able to go anywhere.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.856
If you scan your passport at the border,

25:55.880 --> 25:57.656
there'll be men with guns
bigger than this one

25:57.680 --> 25:59.360
that won't say a word
before they kill you.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.915
And if you do make it to the airport,
we'll be waiting for you.

26:02.920 --> 26:06.311
So hand the package over,
and no one gets hurt.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.400
Except for Drew.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.477
Okay. It's not productive
to keep bringing that up.

26:11.360 --> 26:15.036
That's not Verne.

26:16.920 --> 26:17.920
The package.

26:19.840 --> 26:20.840
Good.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.958
That's not Verne!

26:40.240 --> 26:41.240
What?

26:52.360 --> 26:53.360
What?

27:01.760 --> 27:02.557
Oh, my God.

27:15.720 --> 27:16.720
Morgan!

27:39.160 --> 27:40.160
Oh, my God.

27:54.720 --> 27:55.870
No!

27:56.800 --> 27:57.800
- No!
- Verne, wait!

28:02.760 --> 28:03.910
Holy shit! Run!

28:28.200 --> 28:30.669
Oh, my God! I killed someone!
I killed someone!

28:30.760 --> 28:32.479
- Stop yelling that!
- Oh, my God!

28:34.160 --> 28:35.833
Oh, my God! Wait. Shit.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.536
- Get in the fucking car! Get in the car!
- That car? That's not our car!

28:38.560 --> 28:39.920
- Sorry!
- I'm so sorry! I'm sorry.

28:39.960 --> 28:41.155
Hey! Ah!

28:41.280 --> 28:42.430
Okay! Okay, we're set.

28:42.520 --> 28:43.636
- Oh, shit!
- What?

28:43.720 --> 28:45.560
It's a stick.
Do you know how to drive a stick?

28:46.480 --> 28:48.870
No! No! Fuck!

28:48.960 --> 28:51.336
- Which one's the brake?
- I don't know. There are so many.

28:51.360 --> 28:52.776
How do I change the fucking gear?

28:52.800 --> 28:53.800
How does your car work?

28:53.840 --> 28:54.956
I'm so sorry.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.394
- It's an emergency!
- Oh, my God!

28:56.480 --> 28:58.358
- Oh, God!
- Oh!

29:03.200 --> 29:05.481
- Okay. It wasn't so bad.
- Get out! Abort! Mission abort!

29:05.960 --> 29:08.111
Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

29:08.200 --> 29:09.429
Hurry! Hurry!

29:10.360 --> 29:11.360
Hey!

29:13.000 --> 29:15.560
Stop. The cab. Come on.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.551
Hello. Hi, can we go, please?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.434
- Mr. Yang?
- Yeah.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.273
Yeah, my mother married a Chinese man.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.016
It's a very long, beautiful story.
They met...

29:26.040 --> 29:28.316
We are Yang. We are Mr. Yang. Yes.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.736
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

29:29.760 --> 29:30.936
Thank you. We gotta go.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.519
And we're on the gas.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.160
So, you guys visiting?

29:35.200 --> 29:38.637
No, we live here.
I'm an Austrian man named Mr. Yang. Go.

29:39.680 --> 29:40.680
So, I'm Lukas.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.195
How can I make your ride in Vienna
excellent today?

29:43.280 --> 29:45.496
Everything's fine.
Everything's great. Can you just drive?

29:45.520 --> 29:46.976
Oh, no. Fine is not good enough for me.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.040
- Okay.
- I want excellent.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.351
Would you like some waters?
Still? Sparkling?

29:50.440 --> 29:51.480
No, water. Fully hydrated.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.896
Would you like to listen to music?

29:52.920 --> 29:55.037
No. No, no. No music. Just drive, please.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.431
But I'm not only a driver, actually.
I'm also a DJ on Saturday nights.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.591
Oh, get out! Wow, that's cool.

30:00.680 --> 30:03.240
I don't know if you guys are still in town
on Saturday, but look.

30:04.360 --> 30:05.856
Hip-hop music.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.395
Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.709
Huh? Good, huh?

30:21.320 --> 30:22.720
- Shit!
- Oh, my God!

30:22.840 --> 30:25.435
Okay, listen, buddy. There's
a bunch of men chasing us with guns,

30:25.520 --> 30:27.751
and I need you to lose them now.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.080
Fuck, yeah!

30:31.120 --> 30:32.120
Oh, my God!

30:34.960 --> 30:35.960
Whoo-hoo!

30:38.680 --> 30:40.319
They're men. Oh, my God!

30:41.840 --> 30:43.115
Oh, my God!

30:59.840 --> 31:02.116
I smoked so much meth before.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.554
Great! Great!

31:10.240 --> 31:11.879
Fear is an illusion!

31:18.360 --> 31:19.360
Oh!

31:22.920 --> 31:24.149
High five. Up here.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.954
Oh, fuck!

31:34.600 --> 31:35.920
- Get on top of him.
- Okay.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.229
Oh, my God!

31:42.960 --> 31:45.714
Oh, my God!

31:52.120 --> 31:53.280
Oh, my God. There's one left.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.754
I know. I see him.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.312
Okay, why are you using the turn signal?

31:57.400 --> 31:59.136
You're literally telling him
where we're going.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.256
Sorry. It's a force of habit.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.636
- It's a bad habit.
- No! It's a good habit.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.030
In most circumstances,
it is a very good habit!

32:09.000 --> 32:10.719
Oh, my God!

32:10.800 --> 32:12.075
Fuck you!

32:17.880 --> 32:18.950
Eat my shit!

32:20.280 --> 32:21.794
- Oh, my God!
- Okay.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.314
Get in the front.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.914
Yep. Yeah.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Oh, no!

32:33.080 --> 32:34.976
- I can't get my seat belt on!
- Where the fuck is he?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.400
Oh, my God!

32:38.600 --> 32:40.398
He's on the fucking roof!

32:43.840 --> 32:45.911
Oh, no! It's the man! Stop it!

32:48.680 --> 32:50.319
Oh, my God!

32:53.320 --> 32:54.959
He's on the top! He's on the top!

32:56.320 --> 32:57.754
No!

32:57.840 --> 32:59.718
Okay. There she goes.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.677
- Why are you speeding up?
- I got a plan!

33:16.760 --> 33:18.638
- Okay.
- Hold on!

33:26.080 --> 33:27.150
Oh, my God!

33:35.880 --> 33:37.075
- Get the fuck out!
- Okay.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.759
Great job. Five stars, Lukas.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.479
Five stars.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.189
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:44.480 --> 33:48.076
Oh, God! Jesus! What happened?

33:48.160 --> 33:49.310
We gotta go.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.517
- Oh, God!
- We gotta go somewhere.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.476
There's a train station.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.598
So you're saying you failed?

34:13.679 --> 34:16.717
<i>No, there were some
unforeseen complications,</i>

34:16.800 --> 34:18.553
but I do have the package.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.960
<i>Let's see it.</i>

34:28.239 --> 34:29.719
It appears I don't have it.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.154
<i>So let me get this right.</i>

34:31.560 --> 34:33.552
You didn't get the package.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.911
The girls still have the package.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.356
And now Highland is likely
to get the package.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.656
I won't let that happen, ma'am.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.637
On, well... I'm glad that this happened.

34:41.719 --> 34:43.920
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
been awarded Best Grandson.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.996
<i>Okay. That's funny.</i>

34:48.719 --> 34:50.234
Ma'am? Ma'am, can you hear us?

34:50.320 --> 34:51.389
Ma'am, did you hear us?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.216
<i>- Ma'am, are you frozen?
- Ma'am, can you hear us?</i>

34:53.239 --> 34:54.469
<i>- She's frozen.
- Yeah.</i>

34:54.560 --> 34:56.376
<i>Ma'am, wave
if you're not frozen, please.</i>

34:56.400 --> 34:57.231
Not frozen.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.516
<i>Just disappointed.</i>

34:59.600 --> 35:01.671
I was just trying to protect them.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.434
<i>- Protect them?</i>
- Yeah, let them die. They're idiots.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.696
I know an idiot when I see one.

35:05.720 --> 35:06.631
In the mirror.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.176
I'm not an idiot, Sebastian.
For the record...

35:08.200 --> 35:09.736
Here we go. You went to Harvard.
Yes, we all know.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.496
I didn't even mention Harvard.
That's the thing.

35:11.520 --> 35:12.680
<i>He was gonna mention Harvard.</i>

35:12.760 --> 35:14.720
<i>I was making this simply about merit,
and, yeah...</i>

35:22.520 --> 35:23.749
Yes. Get in.

35:23.840 --> 35:26.116
Okay, look.
I got us two tickets to Prague.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.360
I got us a change of clothes.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.576
Great. We can change on the train.
It leaves in 10 minutes.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.896
And then we can fly home from there.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.600
We just need to get
the fuck out of Vienna.

35:32.640 --> 35:35.872
Wait, wait, wait. Can we just take
a second to appreciate you?

35:35.960 --> 35:37.599
- Now? Right now?
- Yes.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.195
What you did in the cafe
with the gun was insane.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.280
You killed a man.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.192
- It's okay. It was a bad man.
- Oh, my God.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.296
I just play a lot of video games.
Can we please just...

35:45.320 --> 35:47.656
No, then what you did with the trophies.
You switched the trophies.

35:47.680 --> 35:50.616
He literally works in intelligence,
and yet, you were the more intelligent.

35:50.640 --> 35:51.471
How crazy is that?

35:51.560 --> 35:53.552
And then you did all that car stuff.
Oh, my God.

35:53.640 --> 35:56.136
It all just kinda happened really quickly.
Can we please just move on?

35:56.160 --> 35:58.834
Woman, you are incredible,
and I want you to own it.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.196
Listen, I'm owning it.
Can we just go, please?

36:01.280 --> 36:02.191
- Wait. Wait.
- Oh, my God.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.880
No, I'm not gonna let you minimize this.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.696
- I'm not minimizing!
- But you always do this.

36:05.720 --> 36:06.720
You always do this.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.120
- Oh, my God.
- Have you ever,

36:08.200 --> 36:10.476
in your whole life, felt so alive?

36:11.880 --> 36:15.396
<i>Attention,
the train to Prague is now boarding.</i>

36:16.160 --> 36:17.514
We're gonna be a lot less alive

36:17.600 --> 36:19.576
if we don't make it out to the train.
Okay? Please.

36:19.600 --> 36:20.616
Wait, wait, wait. Look at this.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.576
They're really playing up
that Mozart is from here,

36:22.600 --> 36:24.576
and they're really downplaying
that Hitler is from here.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.920
Yeah, I would, too. Get out.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Okay.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.314
What track is it?

36:30.400 --> 36:32.596
Um, looks like track 10 goes to, um...

36:33.120 --> 36:34.952
"Szkalas."

36:35.040 --> 36:37.316
"Szass... Szabadszallas."

36:37.400 --> 36:39.551
"Nove Hodejovice."

36:39.640 --> 36:41.359
"Usti Nad Labem."

36:41.440 --> 36:44.956
"Parndorf ich Bahnhof. Prague."

36:45.040 --> 36:46.336
"Prague." Track six. Oh, thank God.

36:46.360 --> 36:47.496
- Okay, track six.
- Wait. No, no, no!

36:47.520 --> 36:50.320
Sebastian said if we use our passports
we'll get stopped at the border.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.231
Shit.

36:51.320 --> 36:52.515
What do we do?

36:54.800 --> 36:56.896
Okay. We just have to find
two girls who look like us,

36:56.920 --> 36:59.096
tell them what happened,
and convince them to give us theirs,

36:59.120 --> 37:00.936
and then they could say
that theirs were stolen.

37:00.960 --> 37:01.791
Who would do that?

37:01.880 --> 37:03.473
Any girls. Any girls would do that.

37:03.560 --> 37:04.835
Erm, okay. Okay.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.352
How about them? They kinda look like us.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.991
No, we don't wanna be them in Europe.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.989
We wanna be them in Europe.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.917
We go all the way down there,
and then it ends up being there.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.318
- Yeah, we do.
- Tight shorts.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.234
Just imagine the only guy
you've ever loved

37:23.320 --> 37:27.360
dying in front of you
and asking you to do this one thing.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.432
Wouldn't you sacrifice everything?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.320
And then, imagine if that was
your best friend of 12 years.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.600
Wouldn't you go to the ends
of the Earth to protect her?

37:34.640 --> 37:35.471
Yes.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.597
You guys are weird.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.079
Okay. Actually, we're not "weed."

37:40.160 --> 37:41.594
We are in danger.

37:41.680 --> 37:44.296
You'd be saving our lives
and the lives of a lot of innocent people.

37:44.320 --> 37:46.296
Just go to the embassy
and get other passports.

37:46.320 --> 37:49.392
Sorry. We'd love to help you out, mate,
but we just don't know you, and...

37:49.480 --> 37:52.837
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the train to Prague is now leaving.</i>

37:57.000 --> 37:58.096
- You're right. Okay.
- You know what?

37:58.120 --> 38:00.456
- Have a great time in Poland.
- It's been beautiful meeting you.

38:00.480 --> 38:01.357
Now!

38:01.440 --> 38:03.636
- Go! Get it! Shit!
- Stop it!

38:03.760 --> 38:05.274
No!

38:05.360 --> 38:06.360
- No!
- Stop it!

38:07.160 --> 38:09.311
- I got it!
- Stop! No!

38:09.400 --> 38:11.471
Oi! Give me back my bum bag!

38:14.040 --> 38:15.156
Come on! Get in!

38:16.000 --> 38:16.831
Okay. Oh, my God!

38:16.920 --> 38:18.639
- Close.
- Oh, my God! Close.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.598
- Open the door!
- I'm sorry.

38:20.680 --> 38:23.752
Give me back my fucking bum bag,
you bitch!

38:23.840 --> 38:25.320
Look, your address is on it,

38:25.360 --> 38:28.751
so I can mail it back to you
if we survive.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.150
Hello?

38:55.360 --> 38:57.750
Yes. I understand.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.876
Nadedja.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.517
Nadedja. Nadedja, where are you?

39:07.600 --> 39:09.796
Nadedja, you're going to miss
your cue again.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.031
You always do this.

39:29.720 --> 39:32.838
I feel like my best friend always knew
that she wanted to be an actress.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.592
- She's just natural at it.
- Mmm.

39:35.680 --> 39:38.400
I'm not a natural at anything.

39:38.520 --> 39:39.520
I tried law school.

39:39.600 --> 39:40.600
Oh, smart.

39:40.680 --> 39:42.000
Then I tried art school.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.356
That's good. Big swing there.

39:44.440 --> 39:45.635
I dropped out of both.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.876
Yeah, I never finish anything.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.351
Well, hey, you just finished your beer.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.440
Yeah, that I do finish.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.432
So why don't you finish things?
What are you afraid of?

40:02.520 --> 40:04.477
Mmm...

40:04.560 --> 40:05.560
Being average.

40:06.440 --> 40:09.114
Come on. I would not say
that you are average.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.436
How would you know? You just met me.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.033
I'm a pretty good judge of character.

40:16.720 --> 40:17.720
You trust me.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.190
Thank you for the dance.

40:24.280 --> 40:25.999
Would you like me to get you another beer?

40:26.080 --> 40:28.311
- Yeah. That'd be great.
- Sure.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.616
- Can I get two more, please?
- No problem.

40:31.640 --> 40:32.640
Thank you.

40:34.200 --> 40:37.193
Cool, cool, cool.
Okay, so here's my advice, right?

40:37.720 --> 40:39.712
- Who are you?
- Oh, that's my sister.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.631
Really?

40:40.720 --> 40:43.792
Not my biological sister,
but my de facto sister.

40:43.920 --> 40:44.920
- Oh.
- Yeah.

40:44.960 --> 40:48.032
She wouldn't want you to know this,
but she lost her virginity really late,

40:48.120 --> 40:50.191
so she's, like, hungry for it.
You know what I mean?

40:50.280 --> 40:51.839
Oh. Cool.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.559
So have fun with that.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.070
But if you hurt her,

40:56.720 --> 40:58.951
- I'll find your best friend...
- Mmm-hmm.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.236
- ...I'll cut off his dick...
- Mmm-hmm.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.073
...and I'll make you eat it.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.992
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.875
You can have whatever condiments you like,
but you gotta finish it.

41:10.960 --> 41:11.791
What's your name?

41:11.880 --> 41:14.440
- Morgan. How you doing?
- Morgan. Drew.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.591
Morgan, anyone ever tell you
you're a little much?

41:23.760 --> 41:25.720
Why didn't you tell me
that he said that?

41:28.080 --> 41:29.196
You were so into him,

41:29.280 --> 41:31.511
and you can't say shit like
that to your best friend

41:31.600 --> 41:33.592
when your best friend's
in love with somebody.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.800
It didn't hurt my feelings.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.831
Well, a little bit.
It hurt my feelings a little bit.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.798
Morgan. Hey.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.715
I'm really sorry.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.440
I'm sorry, too.

41:49.480 --> 41:50.480
I'm sorry he died.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.596
Oh, God.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.753
What do we do with this thing?

41:54.840 --> 41:55.671
I don't know.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.216
I don't even know what this thing is
or what it does, or anything.

41:58.240 --> 42:01.392
God, I feel like such an idiot
about all this.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.834
I mean, I met his parents.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.320
They were so normal.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.392
Their names are Tom and Marsha.

42:06.480 --> 42:10.156
The night before he disappeared,
we all went to The Cheesecake Factory.

42:10.240 --> 42:11.913
Oh, my God, that menu.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.878
Dostoevsky wrote that menu.

42:14.920 --> 42:17.958
Who introduces people that
don't matter to their parents?

42:18.400 --> 42:20.240
Well, I do. I introduce
everyone to my parents.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.715
But that's their gain,
'cause my parents are magic.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.712
- Do you think they knew?
- I don't know.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.998
I just wish that he was still alive,
so I could get some answers.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.517
And then I would tell him to fucking die.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.200
Open it.

42:43.960 --> 42:44.960
Fuck.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.080
There.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.034
What the fuck is that?

42:51.120 --> 42:52.759
It's a flash drive.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.616
They were
killing each other for this?

42:54.640 --> 42:55.869
Oh, my God.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.736
You know who would know
what we should do right now?

42:57.760 --> 43:00.753
- No.
- My father is a brilliant attorney...

43:00.840 --> 43:03.400
- No. Mmm-mmm.
- ...who has represented people

43:03.480 --> 43:05.790
who are in much worse trouble
than we are right now.

43:05.880 --> 43:10.113
No. Your dad would be furious at us
for breaking a million international laws.

43:10.200 --> 43:11.270
No. He's not gonna be mad.

43:11.680 --> 43:14.115
He wasn't mad when I tried cocaine
with my basketball coach.

43:14.560 --> 43:17.120
He wasn't mad at me when
I got deported from Belize.

43:17.880 --> 43:20.236
He didn't get mad when I
invited that teenage magician

43:20.320 --> 43:21.754
to live in my grandma's condo.

43:21.840 --> 43:24.480
Oh, yeah. What ever happened to him?

43:26.920 --> 43:29.719
You're not gonna believe this.
He disappeared.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.160
Shut up.

43:32.440 --> 43:34.671
No, he actually... He is a missing person.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.432
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mom, it's me.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.672
- Oh, thank God. Arnie, she's okay!
<i>- What?</i>

43:54.760 --> 43:56.480
<i>I'm gonna
conference your father in.</i>

43:57.520 --> 43:59.989
- This is Arnie.
<i>- Hi, Dad.</i>

44:00.080 --> 44:01.719
Hey, button! Hi!

44:01.800 --> 44:03.678
Honey, you're all over the papers.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.595
I'm so proud of you.

44:05.680 --> 44:07.717
I always knew the world
would write about you.

44:08.320 --> 44:10.516
Did you color your hair?
You look like a princess.

44:10.600 --> 44:13.434
Sweetie, let me ask you.
Did you and Audrey murder two people?

44:13.520 --> 44:15.136
Tell me the truth.
I can get you out of it.

44:15.160 --> 44:17.197
No, what happened was,
I murdered one person,

44:17.280 --> 44:18.873
but it was an assassin, so...

44:18.960 --> 44:20.952
- Shh.
- So it didn't count.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.156
No, it doesn't count.

44:22.240 --> 44:24.277
And Audrey murdered
a bunch of people in Austria.

44:24.360 --> 44:26.079
- Oh, my God.
- But it was self-defense.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.160
Also fine.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.736
Her boyfriend was murdered in front of us.

44:28.760 --> 44:31.753
- The handsome one?
- I mean, he was fine, I guess.

44:31.840 --> 44:34.674
Oh, you know who's really
handsome is Patrick Dempsey.

44:34.760 --> 44:37.355
- Where are you now, sweetie?
<i>- I'm in Prague.</i>

44:37.440 --> 44:39.636
I don't care for Eastern Europe.
Too gothic.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.951
<i>Okay, listen.
I got a place where you can hide.</i>

44:42.040 --> 44:44.350
- Okay.
- I got a friend, Roger Bernstein.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.511
Lives in Prague. Guy owes me a favor.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.160
Dad represented Roger
in a malpractice suit.

44:49.240 --> 44:51.072
<i>Whoa, Carol,
you know who's handsome?</i>

44:51.600 --> 44:54.115
Woody Harrelson.
You know, people don't think it.

44:54.200 --> 44:55.395
I find him handsome.

44:55.880 --> 44:58.056
- <i>She fell over.
- Yeah, I did, actually.</i>

44:58.080 --> 45:00.117
<i>There was one moment
I thought I was gonna die.</i>

45:00.200 --> 45:01.998
<i>Yeah. They've got something
wrong with them.</i>

45:02.080 --> 45:02.911
Morgan...

45:10.040 --> 45:12.032
Now. Now. We gotta go.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.656
- <i>Remember the Dingle twins?</i>
- Mom...

45:13.680 --> 45:16.434
We gotta go. Come on. Come on. Now!

45:57.520 --> 45:58.520
Who am I looking for?

45:58.560 --> 46:00.240
<i>I texted pictures.</i>

46:00.360 --> 46:02.795
<i>Targets are two dumb American women.</i>

46:38.880 --> 46:39.711
Oh, my God!

46:39.800 --> 46:40.800
Oh!

46:41.200 --> 46:43.112
You're lagging. You're lagging.

46:46.800 --> 46:50.077
Shit. Okay.
We need to find Karlova Street.

46:50.200 --> 46:50.997
Ooof!

46:51.120 --> 46:52.800
Looks like Elephant Valley is on the left.

46:52.880 --> 46:55.236
We're gonna pass the Pavilion
of Big Tortoises in a second.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.798
Morgan, this is a map of the zoo.

47:11.400 --> 47:12.231
Okay.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.336
<i>Hello?</i>

47:17.360 --> 47:20.273
Yes, Roger, it's Arnie's daughter.
He called.

47:21.280 --> 47:23.078
Go. Thank you!

47:27.000 --> 47:28.275
<i>You know, it's funny.</i>

47:28.360 --> 47:30.352
I remember one time, back in the day,

47:30.440 --> 47:33.160
your dad and I were getting
ready to go out in the Hamptons.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.154
Your dad had his sunglasses on.

47:35.240 --> 47:37.880
He turned his collar up. He looked super.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.710
We get to the disco, the guy says to him,
"Sir, sir, your collar is up."

47:41.800 --> 47:43.439
Ruined the whole effect.

47:44.440 --> 47:46.193
Hope you don't think
I'm being presumptuous,

47:46.280 --> 47:48.795
but I thought you gals looked
like you'd enjoy some pot...

47:50.440 --> 47:51.351
roast.

47:53.640 --> 47:56.394
I'm okay. I'm actually...
I'm so sorry. I am a vegan.

47:56.480 --> 47:57.550
Oh.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.392
Morgan, you're not a vegan.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.473
What? 'Cause of the bacon?

48:02.560 --> 48:03.710
Bacon's meat.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.190
Well, listen. At least let me
get you a little vino, okay?

48:06.320 --> 48:09.791
I mean, the only animal cruelty involved
in that is what the wine guy charges me.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.792
I actually like to keep
all the best bottles

48:12.880 --> 48:14.872
over there in the study. It's like a...

48:15.520 --> 48:18.115
It's sort of like my homage
to all the great storytellers.

48:18.200 --> 48:19.031
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.430
Right now, I'm working my way
through a grenache noir

48:21.520 --> 48:24.718
while I enjoy a first edition
of <i>La ComÃ©die humaine.</i>

48:25.040 --> 48:27.680
- Oh.
- Are you into Balzac?

48:28.040 --> 48:29.793
Less and less with every experience.

48:31.280 --> 48:32.680
Well, I'll be right back.

48:33.040 --> 48:34.110
Okay.

48:37.560 --> 48:38.676
It's happening again.

48:39.120 --> 48:39.951
What is?

48:40.040 --> 48:41.679
He's into me.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.035
What are you talking about?

48:43.120 --> 48:44.873
He wants a slice. Rog.

48:45.160 --> 48:48.551
No, he's just, you know,
like a little weird.

48:49.440 --> 48:51.591
Older men, they gravitate toward me.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.797
- Okay. Oh, God.
- They love me.

48:53.880 --> 48:55.678
They want this.

48:55.760 --> 48:57.200
- If that makes them weird...
- Yeah.

48:57.280 --> 48:59.954
...then my SAT math tutor was weird,
our landlord is weird.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.878
- He's weird.
- Mandy Patinkin is weird.

49:02.840 --> 49:05.992
Mmm. I feel a little nauseated.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.800
I'm okay. You just stay.
I'll be right back.

49:08.040 --> 49:09.040
Love you.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.993
Hi. Audrey okay?

49:14.400 --> 49:16.710
Oh, yeah, she's fine.
She's finished. So am I.

49:16.800 --> 49:19.713
Well, at least let me give you a <i>digestif.</i>

49:27.240 --> 49:28.435
Ah! It's dry.

49:28.520 --> 49:31.035
So are you a lover of art?

49:31.120 --> 49:34.750
Yeah, yeah, oh, lot of art. Love art.

49:37.320 --> 49:38.720
And look at that art.

49:39.120 --> 49:41.271
Doesn't look like she's
enjoying herself too much.

49:41.600 --> 49:44.638
Sometimes the sweetest pleasure comes
when you're not enjoying yourself.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.794
Don't know that I agree with that.

49:49.840 --> 49:50.840
You wouldn't?

49:51.720 --> 49:53.279
Okay. We're doing a massage now.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.315
Here we go.

50:00.600 --> 50:01.600
Oh, my God.

50:02.600 --> 50:03.600
Oh, my God.

50:13.720 --> 50:17.270
Roger, thank you so much
for having us at your home.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.760
It's my great pleasure.

50:18.840 --> 50:21.480
But I just... I don't think...
I don't think so.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.271
That actually kind... That kind of hurts.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.600
Huh. Hello.

50:27.720 --> 50:28.995
Who's this? I'm Morgan.

50:29.080 --> 50:30.136
I'm a family friend.

50:30.160 --> 50:32.117
Is this your girlfriend?

50:32.200 --> 50:35.159
Nadedja, no.
We have to bring them in alive.

50:40.040 --> 50:41.040
Weird.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.554
Ow. Ow.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.472
- Audrey.
- Oh, my God.

50:48.560 --> 50:52.156
Audrey, Roger is bad. Bad.

50:52.240 --> 50:54.436
No, that's not Roger.

50:57.560 --> 50:58.596
That's Roger.

50:59.880 --> 51:02.190
Ah!

51:02.720 --> 51:03.720
They want the drive.

51:05.320 --> 51:07.118
You have to swallow it
before they come back.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.317
- What?
- I have thrown up, like, nine times.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.959
- What?
- I can't do it.

51:11.040 --> 51:13.999
Well, I can't swallow anything.

51:14.080 --> 51:15.799
I can't even swallow Advil.

51:15.880 --> 51:18.395
I have to crush it up in my applesauce.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.199
No. You gotta swallow this.

51:20.280 --> 51:21.509
No, I... Oh!

51:22.680 --> 51:25.559
Fine. Okay. If you really want me to.

51:25.640 --> 51:27.711
Oh, my God, you're heavy.

51:27.800 --> 51:30.520
- Shut the fuck up, bitch.
- Okay.

51:30.600 --> 51:32.751
Yeah. Ah! Ah!

51:32.840 --> 51:33.840
Okay.

51:34.920 --> 51:35.920
Close your nose.

51:42.920 --> 51:44.479
Shit. Shit.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.074
Let's try it one more time.

51:46.160 --> 51:49.198
Ah. Ooh. Ah!

51:50.240 --> 51:51.469
Whoa.

51:51.560 --> 51:52.710
No, keep it in.

51:58.840 --> 52:00.035
I can't.

52:00.120 --> 52:01.120
Shit.

52:01.720 --> 52:02.720
I can't do it.

52:03.760 --> 52:04.760
I tried.

52:11.920 --> 52:12.920
Uh-oh.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.559
There's the ice cream lady.

52:59.360 --> 53:00.360
Audrey.

53:00.720 --> 53:01.870
- Hmm.
- Audrey.

53:03.960 --> 53:04.960
Are you okay?

53:06.440 --> 53:07.440
Oh, God.

53:08.280 --> 53:10.636
Oh, God. I don't... I don't know.

53:12.760 --> 53:13.760
Where the fuck are we?

53:13.840 --> 53:14.840
I don't know.

53:15.320 --> 53:17.915
Audrey, how are you feelin'?

53:18.280 --> 53:20.920
Marsha, Tom. Those are...
Those are Drew's parents.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.799
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry that
you got dragged into this.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.837
I never meant for Drew to die.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.240
We know you didn't, Audrey.

53:27.320 --> 53:29.277
We're just glad you're alive.

53:29.360 --> 53:32.319
Will you untie us before they come back
and tie you up too? Please.

53:32.400 --> 53:34.710
So where's the drive?

53:35.480 --> 53:36.277
Oh.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.400
You know about that?

53:38.120 --> 53:40.430
Shut up, you dumb bitch.

53:40.520 --> 53:41.397
Fuck you.

53:41.480 --> 53:43.551
You wanna tell your friend
to answer the question?

53:43.640 --> 53:45.996
Trust me, your son would've
wanted you to protect us.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Audrey...

53:48.920 --> 53:50.513
I don't think those are Drew's parents.

53:51.120 --> 53:52.474
Of course they are.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.871
- No.
- We went out to The Cheesecake Factory.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.593
We shared chicken lettuce cups.

53:56.680 --> 53:59.479
We were at that restaurant
to negotiate the sale of the drive.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.198
But we talked about real things.
We talked about Tom's colonoscopy.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.714
Not getting a colonoscopy.

54:04.800 --> 54:07.156
He only took you to the restaurant
as insurance,

54:07.240 --> 54:09.200
so we wouldn't kill him
if he left with the drive.

54:09.280 --> 54:11.112
Okay, let's get this done.

54:11.960 --> 54:14.111
Where is the fucking drive?

54:15.200 --> 54:16.316
No. No.

54:16.440 --> 54:19.114
Please, sir. Sir, please don't.

54:19.200 --> 54:21.476
That's my best friend. Please, just...

54:21.560 --> 54:23.199
I flushed it down the toilet.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.234
Do you know what you've done?

54:31.160 --> 54:32.160
Nadedja.

54:39.960 --> 54:41.189
Oh, good God.

55:03.160 --> 55:04.160
What is that?

55:20.520 --> 55:23.240
<i>Five kilometers out.
Closing in on the safe house.</i>

55:24.120 --> 55:26.157
<i>Backup units, be advised,
subjects heavily armed.</i>

55:34.280 --> 55:35.953
Wow! You're so pretty.

55:36.520 --> 55:38.239
You're barely human, you're so pretty.

55:38.760 --> 55:40.433
And look how flexible you are.

55:40.520 --> 55:41.520
Morgan, shut up.

55:41.560 --> 55:43.438
No, everybody likes compliments.

55:43.520 --> 55:45.480
She's definitely
not loving this, Morgan.

55:45.560 --> 55:47.320
She loves it. It's working.

55:47.360 --> 55:49.016
You just... You are so...

55:49.040 --> 55:50.633
You're so bad.

55:51.800 --> 55:55.271
Oh! Hey. Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.

55:55.360 --> 55:57.238
You wanna get outta here
and get a bite to eat?

55:57.320 --> 55:58.515
I like you.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.955
Oh, my God!

56:10.920 --> 56:12.798
Shit! They got the drive.

56:13.720 --> 56:14.720
Fuck.

56:15.120 --> 56:17.096
All right, kids, on my count,
send the grenades in.

56:17.120 --> 56:20.016
- Let's blow this motherfucker up.
- Wait! The girls could still be in there.

56:20.040 --> 56:22.840
Yeah, and if they are, they're either
surrounded by terrorists or dead.

56:22.920 --> 56:23.751
Also, I don't care.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.309
Just give me five minutes
and three agents. I need to check.

56:26.400 --> 56:27.720
Oh, so four agents can die?

56:27.800 --> 56:29.280
You know this is my operation, right?

56:29.920 --> 56:32.480
So just sit tight,
and let's crush this mother

56:32.560 --> 56:34.950
the way we crushed Yale at football
nine years in a row.

56:35.040 --> 56:37.316
And by "we," I mean Harvard.
Let's blow 'em up.

56:38.200 --> 56:39.919
- <i>Roger that.</i>
- Watch the show.

56:43.080 --> 56:44.799
Uh...

56:44.920 --> 56:47.913
Actually, guys, hold up.
Abort mission.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.312
- <i>Copy that.</i>
- Go Crimson.

56:58.440 --> 57:03.231
I ask question.
If I don't like answer, you feel pain.

57:05.160 --> 57:06.435
Same as her.

57:07.280 --> 57:08.953
It looks worse than it is.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.271
I have freakishly strong teeth.

57:11.360 --> 57:14.273
I had braces for nine years.
My orthodontist published a paper.

57:15.840 --> 57:16.840
Where is drive?

57:17.680 --> 57:20.400
I already told you.
I flushed it down the toilet.

57:22.040 --> 57:22.837
You lie.

57:22.960 --> 57:26.556
No, I don't. I don't lie. No, no, no, no.

57:26.640 --> 57:29.235
Oh, my God!

57:31.080 --> 57:31.911
Argh.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.879
Please, I'm begging you. Please.
Please, do me a favor

57:35.960 --> 57:37.917
and eat my tit, bitch.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.879
And please, please. Please, just please

57:41.400 --> 57:42.595
go fuck yourself.

57:43.600 --> 57:46.638
'Cause I'd love it
if you would please just go fuck yourself.

58:10.840 --> 58:14.117
Trust me that I'm a terrible,
terrible liar.

58:14.640 --> 58:17.872
- Everybody knows when I'm lying.
- I can't lie.

58:18.480 --> 58:20.711
Me, too. I've never kept
a secret in my life.

58:20.800 --> 58:21.916
Secrets are poison.

58:22.240 --> 58:23.913
Maybe you keep secret for her.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.720
No, I'll tell you anything
that you wanna know about her.

58:26.800 --> 58:28.029
'Cause I know it all.

58:28.800 --> 58:31.190
She texts and drives.
She does it all the time.

58:31.320 --> 58:34.154
She Instagrams on the freeway.
She hashtags it "driving."

58:34.280 --> 58:35.280
What are you doing?

58:35.360 --> 58:37.096
I'm proving to her
that we don't keep secrets.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.474
Just tell her something about me.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.119
Okay, okay. Um,

58:40.200 --> 58:42.271
Morgan stole her dad's pain pills
after his surgery

58:42.360 --> 58:43.476
and sold them at Coachella.

58:43.560 --> 58:44.391
I did.

58:44.480 --> 58:47.234
Audrey was once babysitting
this eight-year-old kid

58:47.320 --> 58:49.676
and she flirted with him
to get him to go to sleep.

58:49.760 --> 58:50.796
His name was Liam.

58:50.920 --> 58:52.400
She has sex dreams about Minions.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.995
Just the one Minion
with the one eye.

58:55.080 --> 58:56.833
Is that supposed to be a dick?

58:56.920 --> 59:01.119
She googled it on my computer,
and now I get a lot of weird ads.

59:01.200 --> 59:02.634
I said I was sorry.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.677
Audrey shaves between her boobs.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.114
Uh, Morgan kissed her cousin.

59:06.200 --> 59:07.376
I didn't know it was my cousin.

59:07.400 --> 59:08.675
Morgan has HPV.

59:08.760 --> 59:10.160
Audrey has HPV.

59:10.240 --> 59:11.936
Morgan had sex
in a playground once.

59:11.960 --> 59:13.120
Audrey hit a dog in the face.

59:13.200 --> 59:14.714
Morgan had lice as an adult.

59:14.800 --> 59:16.917
Audrey can't come
'cause she's on antidepressants.

59:17.240 --> 59:19.072
I can! It just takes me a very long time.

59:20.160 --> 59:21.389
Oh, look.

59:21.480 --> 59:23.358
Hey, hey.

59:23.440 --> 59:25.352
- It's working. It's working.
- Yeah.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.520
What else do you wanna know?
We'll tell you anything.

59:28.760 --> 59:30.240
How you know so much about her?

59:31.120 --> 59:32.120
And she about you?

59:32.640 --> 59:36.316
Uh, she's my best friend.
We know everything about each other.

59:36.400 --> 59:37.880
You have a best friend, right?

59:37.960 --> 59:39.576
- Of course she has a best friend.
- Yeah.

59:39.600 --> 59:43.230
Look at her. You're so charming,
and you have so many good hobbies.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.616
- Hobbies.
- You do...

59:44.640 --> 59:46.216
- You do have a best friend.
- Yeah.

59:46.240 --> 59:47.656
She does have a best friend.

59:47.680 --> 59:49.478
Tell us about your best friend.

59:49.560 --> 59:52.029
- Who is she?
- What's her name? What does she look like?

59:52.120 --> 59:53.120
Bobik.

59:53.960 --> 59:56.191
- Bobik?
- Bobik.

59:56.320 --> 59:57.640
- Oh.
- Tell us about her.

59:57.720 --> 59:59.040
Tell us everything about her.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480
Bobik.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.056
- It's a balance beam.
- Oh.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.355
It's a fucking balance beam.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.351
Oh, God, no.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.056
Your balance beam's
your best fucking friend?

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.275
What? Ah, no, no.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.509
Oh, fuck.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.353
Oh, fuck.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.276
You fucking dick, Henshaw!

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.400
Fuck.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.595
Okay. Light it up.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.200
<i>Copy. Sending in the grenades.</i>

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.431
- What?
- Oh, my God.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.750
Who's that?

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.150
Oh, my God!

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.875
- Yes!
- Oh!

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.560
Sebastian!

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.795
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.033
- Stay close.
- Thank you so much.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.393
Oh, my God.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.280
Oh, my God!

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.150
Okay, I trust you now.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.518
Jesus, I should hope so.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.117
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.600
What?

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.316
Get in the fucking car.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.640
Us?

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.795
I thought that
the international intelligence office

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.439
would be fancier.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.920
It's a temporary space.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.753
We don't wanna
call attention to ourselves.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.557
I know, but can you hang a poster?
Can we get a drape? Something?

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.552
This is what our tax dollars
are paying for?

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.632
You haven't paid
your taxes for three years.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320
You know that?

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.237
Hey, look, Sebastian, I'm really sorry
I didn't give you the drive at that cafe.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.277
Nah. No, I understand.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.440
Drew told you to keep it safe.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.758
Can you at least tell us
what's on that drive?

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.196
All we know is, it was made
by an international terrorist group

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.280
named Highland.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.520
Intelligence tells us
they're planning a series of attacks.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.360
If we had it, we'd know how to stop them.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.672
Henshaw, my office.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.873
What? Wait, wait.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.753
This is your boss? You're the boss?

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.352
We have a real-life
Judi Dench in our midst.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.271
You are the boss,

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.512
and yet you have not sacrificed
one ounce of femininity.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.515
Why have we been spending
all of this time talking to the men,

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.435
when this being has been floating
through the halls of the building?

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.351
Oh, my God.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.635
That's a compliment.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.393
That is the BeyoncÃ© of the government.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.550
Duffer, stay here.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.678
I have so much respect for you that it has
circled around into objectification.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.760
Ma'am!

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.996
I'm sorry, ma'am. I know I overstepped.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.480
Overstepped? No.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.837
I'd say what you did
was closer to treason.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.833
Treason? I was merely trying to help.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.231
How long did your doctor say
that your arm would take to heal?

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.358
Um, three months for the bullet wound,
one for the sprain.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.476
Fantastic.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.440
Take four months' leave.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.319
Oh, no. I assume he meant
the two would heal simultaneously.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.516
I know what I said.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.960
Please take me through this.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.319
What exactly was going through your mind
when you flushed it down the toilet?

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.232
Were you thinking, "Oh, I know.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.279
People are dying because of this.
So here's what I'll do.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.791
I'll treat it like a piece of shit,
wrapped up in toilet paper,

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.872
and then flush it down the toilet"?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.310
Oh, this is funny? Death is funny to you?

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.436
No, I'm sorry.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.879
But that's how you go to the bathroom?

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.353
Oh, great. Okay. Awesome.
Great. You two laugh.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.830
Meanwhile, let me tell you
how many people have died

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.078
and will die because of your stupidity.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.079
I'm sorry. Just let me get this straight.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.437
So you wrap your hands in toilet paper,
and then you poop into that,

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.513
and then that whole contraption
is what you drop into the toilet?

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.640
That was just a metaphor.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.736
You know that the toilet is designed
to take the work out of it for you, right?

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.320
No, that's not what I was saying.
I was say... I didn't say that.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.953
I poop normally. Like everybody else.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.680
Of course, yes. I know. I'm sorry. Okay.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.678
Hey, uh, I wanna say goodbye.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.720
Where are you going?

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.149
I've been suspended.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.717
You two are to go back to Los Angeles.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.160
- What?
- What?

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.754
Duffer, transport these women
to de Gaulle.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.957
Ma'am. Ma'am? Ma'am?

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.440
Please don't send us home.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.318
Spying, not easy. We know that now.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.837
But we have been a real help
to this operation,

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.470
and I know the drive is gone,
but we are in this, boss.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.876
And if you would just give us a chance,

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.078
I think that we could be
a major resource for you.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:12.155
Would you consider keeping us on

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.955
in this intelligence bureau?

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280
Please.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560
Ma'am.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.560
Okay.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.790
All right.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.632
I am going to take a chance on you two.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.313
- Really?
- Hmm.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.914
I could really use you.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.635
- What?
- Hmm.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.194
Are you serious?

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.320
No.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.594
Their flight leaves in four hours.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.074
Hey, Morgan, I think
that we should probably just head out.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.755
The fact that we even survived
this is just dumb luck.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.880
I really just wanna go home.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.032
What? Why would you wanna go home
in the middle of all this?

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.395
We're a part of this.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.312
Come on, this isn't...
This isn't who we are.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.556
Okay? We've done enough.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.517
Can we please just go home?

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.440
I'm done.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.600
- Morgan, now.
- Okay. Yes. Yes.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.096
- That's a great idea.
- Okay.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.696
Hey, Seb, why don't you drop 'em off
at the airport on your way home?

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.554
It'll prepare you for your next career,
being a SuperShuttle driver.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.276
Out of curiosity,

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.680
if we still had the drive,
what would've happened?

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.591
Hypothetically?

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.511
Yeah.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.717
Uh, I'd figure out how to de-encrypt it,

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.918
then see what Highland's plans are
and stop them.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.152
How do you de-encrypt something like that?

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.560
Why do you wanna know all this?

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.993
Because the drive is in my vagina.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.111
- What?
- What?

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.600
I mean, look, everybody kept saying
that it was so important,

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.016
and I wasn't gonna flush
something that important down the toilet.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.640
- Why didn't you just give it to Duffer?
- 'Cause he's an asshole.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.189
Wait, so when you said
you wanted to go home...

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.638
Yes, it was because
I had the flash drive in my vagina.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.837
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.037
- I know!
- Does it hurt? Does it not hurt?

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.270
You get used to it.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:24.033
Wait, so you were lying to that bitch
when she was torturing us?

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.277
- Yeah.
- And you lied to me?

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:28.113
You broke our sacred bond of trust.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.872
I know, Morgan. I'm so sorry.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.456
But it's okay, 'cause it was amazing!

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:33.915
I, um... Well, I don't mean to be
impolite about this but...

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.232
Do you think you could
access it from the...

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.996
place that...

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.072
- Oh, yeah.
- In the...

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.356
- What? Here?
- Just don't look here.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.760
Oh.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.536
This is good. You should get it out.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.841
'Cause the ultimate irony would be
if you saved the world,

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.439
and then died of toxic shock syndrome.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:03.595
Oh, there it is.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.511
Oh.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.816
Do you wanna just... Should I put it...

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.957
- No. I'll, uh...
- Like, a tissue?

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.957
No, no, no. I'll take it. I'll take it.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:17.312
So are you gonna use that
to get your job back?

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:19.278
People at my job
just tried to kill all of us,

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:21.376
so, to be honest,
I'm not sure who to trust anymore.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:23.198
But thank you.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.151
For trusting me.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:30.591
Now, will you trust us?

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.120
To help you?

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.474
I mean, you're injured,
so I feel like you kind of need us.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.836
I mean, we're naturals. We're operatives.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.840
We're semi-professionals at this point.
Professional. We are professional.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.796
So, um...

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.197
Morgan, your idea of blending in
is that outfit?

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.190
Yeah.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.398
Do I not look just like a French woman?

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.880
I look like a French woman.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.953
You look like a French curtain.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.756
Yeah, 'cause I can hang.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.400
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Mmm?

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.239
Something really weird on this drive.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.680
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.440
Not all of us
are perfectly waxed porn stars down there.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.239
Some of us have stuff.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.910
Oh, no, I meant the information on it.
It's State Department encryption.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.560
Oh.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.391
Right.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480
Figures.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.320
What do you mean?

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.035
Meaning Highland didn't make it.
Your government did.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.792
I can't access it. I don't have clearance.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:39.709
What do you mean? You're a spy.
Can't you just hack it?

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.678
Well, they change
the password every 24 hours.

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.156
Even if I had a supercomputer,
it'd take days.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.600
So what are you saying?

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.675
I'm saying we can't get
onto the flash drive.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.796
What?

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.456
There's gotta be something else we can do.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.917
Not unless you have access to an expert
in US Intelligence computer security.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.600
One minute.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.111
Um...

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.400
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.315
That's all I remember
from high school French.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.393
Um, shit. What were the lines I had
in that French student film?

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.315
Um...

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.640
Oh, God.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.880
No?

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.712
I need to borrow this for one minute.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.229
I will be there.

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.398
Uh-huh. Hmm.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.516
This is Edward.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.915
Eddie. Eddie Snowden.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.835
<i>It's Morgan from Buck's Rock Camp.</i>

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.920
Oh, my God.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.154
Morgan. Um...

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.189
Wow, it's been forever. I, uh...

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.520
I sent you a bunch of emails
over the years.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.592
You did? Shoot!

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.832
Well, that's upsetting.
I don't know where they went.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.560
I thought that you might not
have your AOL account anymore.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.155
Oh, yeah. I switched to Gmail in '04.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.471
Oh. Actually, I knew that.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.836
Right. I guess you would.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.440
So I've been following the news.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.000
<i>Oh, my God. Eddie.</i>

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.958
You have to understand,
we didn't kill anybody.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.110
On purpose.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.237
Of course. It's called a frame job.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.834
They do that.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.310
Uh... Tell me what you need, Morgan.
I'm here for you.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.275
Are you near a computer?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Always.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.996
A capital H. Add sign.
Lowercase U.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.920
Lowercase J.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.914
Percentage sign.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.912
- Yes, percentage.
- Uppercase Y.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.160
Oh, my God. That's right.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.836
Okay. So?

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.755
What are Highland's plans?

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.552
These aren't Highland's plans.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.715
This drive is a back door
to the entire Internet.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.233
Finances, emails. Everyone's secrets.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.554
We need to get out of here now.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.354
Oh. We gotta go.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.954
- Uh-huh.
- Morgan.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.991
You call me if you're ever in LA now.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.349
LA's gonna be hard.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.351
<i>I need to add another target.</i>

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.715
- Double rate.
<i>- No.</i>

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:55.350
<i>You already failed twice.
The girls are still alive.</i>

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.033
<i>Highland is very upset.</i>

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.519
Well, hello, beautiful.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.236
Baby...

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.800
What happened to your face?

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.880
What happened to yours?

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.200
Where we goin', chief?

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.232
Amsterdam.
We'll be safe there.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.155
Can I help you?

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.120
Thank you.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.320
Nice boobs.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.440
Thanks.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.998
<i>Remember,
the best place to hide</i>

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.958
<i>is somewhere full of suspicious people.</i>

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.280
Oh, my God,
is this what crack smells like?

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.991
Is this the couple
you saw at the gymnasium?

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.639
Ivan and Raisa Petrenko.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.433
Heads of the Highland crime syndicate.

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.034
- Out of Moscow.
- Oh.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.955
Oligarchs, arms dealers, blackmailers,
and former gymnastic coaches.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.114
And this is their trained assassin
and former student.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.237
Not a fan.

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.416
You guys. Audrey, come here.
It's us. We're on the news.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.216
<i>Thought to be part of
a bigger terrorist plot...</i>

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.117
We're on TV.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.816
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- It's happening.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.736
<i>...the women were allegedly involved
in the murder of a local ophthalmologist,</i>

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.753
<i>which may have had a sexual motive.</i>

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.071
Sexual motive? Yeah. He wishes.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.160
<i>The FBI has released transcripts
of Facebook messages between the suspects.</i>

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.391
Oh, shit, Morgan. It's our chats.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:35.040
<i>"I just wish he would die.
Is that too much to ask?"</i>

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:39.876
<i>"Just for someone to expletive murder
him," said Audrey Stockman</i>

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.189
Oh, my God.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.877
<i>Then, "Do you want me to murder him?
I totally will.</i>

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.959
<i>That's what friends are for.</i>

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:53.035
<i>Music note emoji. Music note emoji."
Replied Morgan Freeman.</i>

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:54.395
<i>Authorities are...</i>

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.709
Your name is Morgan Freeman.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.630
I just put that together.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.038
Yeah. I can always get
a reservation wherever I want.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.437
<i>Honestly, I just don't believe
that Audrey would ever do this.</i>

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.397
Oh.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.756
<i>- She's just not that kind of person.</i>
- Wow, okay.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.479
<i>You know. She's not that sophisticated.</i>

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.520
<i>I mean, she's 30 years old,</i>

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.592
<i>and she doesn't even have
a bed frame, so...</i>

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.876
Box spring counts. A box spring counts.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.792
We've talked about this.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.200
Americans?

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:37.880
Hey.

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.320
Hi.

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.033
I hope you're not upset about
what that girl said on the news.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.352
Oh, well, I'm not that surprised.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.000
It's not like I've done
anything that impressive with my life.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.480
I've seen you do some impressive things.

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:05.516
You were a great shot in the cafe.
You switched the trophies on me.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.829
You didn't break
when you were being tortured.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.160
Plus you had the foresight
to stick that thing up your...

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.632
...thing.

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.760
You know, I'm impressed with you, too.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.871
You risked your whole life for me.
Not many people would have done that.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.634
Including...
...my ex-boyfriend.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.679
Yeah, about that, I...

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.795
I wanna clear something up.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.436
You weren't just a cover for Drew.
That much I know.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.760
How?

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.157
I was there the night you two met.
At your birthday.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.560
What? At the bar?

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.074
Outside, in the surveillance van.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.400
Drew was in the bar to take out a target.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:48.869
- Wait, who?
- The bartender.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.000
He was a recruiter for ISIS.

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.036
Craft bourbon cocktail
with tobacco bitters

01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.790
and rhubarb zest.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.640
Can you identify him as the target?

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.880
- Oops, I'm sorry.
- Oh, sorry.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.030
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.430
No. Do not get distracted.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.591
<i>- Yeah.
- It's not my birthday.</i>

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:24.920
<i>- Oh.
- I, um..</i>.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.336
<i>I just kind of wear it for warmth.</i>

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.696
- <i>Well, if it was your birthday...</i>
- She's funny.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.995
<i>I would say "Happy birthday."</i>

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.878
Thayer, get away from her now.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.633
In our line of work, being with someone...

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.755
caring about them...

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.594
it makes our job harder.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.759
So if Drew was trying with you, then...

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.480
That was real.

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.758
And not that you asked my opinion,

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:53.671
but the worst song on that jukebox
is "Your Body Is a Wonderland."

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.040
No question.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.031
Oh, my God. What?

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.192
What? No way! Absolutely not. No.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.077
Um, I lost my virginity to that song.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.958
What?

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.600
To who? The cheesiest person in the world?

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.080
Oh!

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.919
Oh, hey, guys.

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.719
Uh, rookworst, am I right?

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.839
It always works.
It's actually kind of funny.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.193
Audrey!

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:30.400
Oh, my God. Morgan.

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.796
She talks too much.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.880
Duffer.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:38.516
Jesus!

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.816
Oh, my God! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.957
Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Move! Move!

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.394
Hands up.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.816
- Okay.
- That's both hands, cripple.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.800
Come on, Seb. Higher.

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.715
Just because I can.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.439
What's this about, Duffer? Revenge?

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.674
I was suspended. You won.

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.672
Come on, man. I know I won.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.031
I'm just here for this.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.477
Of course,
now I have a few loose ends to tie up.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.074
Hey! Hey!

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.755
Okay!
He has nothing to do with this, okay?

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.991
I promise you this is just Morgan and me.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.595
So, why don't you go back to the CIA,
and tell them that?

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.716
Jesus.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.280
You don't know that I'm the bad guy?

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.360
What?

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.040
He's not here on CIA business.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.233
He's working for Highland now.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.198
You have no idea
how much the Chinese mafia's

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.600
willing to pay for this.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.070
Or the Russian mafia.
Multiple mafias want this.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:31.752
And, on that note,
I'll finish you all off and be on my way.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.594
As much fun as it's been
watching you fucktards

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.592
play <i>Tinker Tailor Stoner Spy.</i>

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.560
Okay, I got it.

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:44.471
That's a joke, Audrey.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.816
It's funny, because I'm funny.
You know what? It doesn't matter.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.856
Because there's one thing
that's mightier than the pen,

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.016
and it's called a fucking handgun!

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.635
- Oh, my God.
- So, for heckling me, Audrey...

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.456
Oh, my God. Please don't do this.
Please don't do this.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.311
Duffer, don't do this.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.993
- You die first.
- Duffer!

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.600
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.080
Oh.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:08.633
This man, he want to rob from us, right?

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.560
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.
- Yes. Absolutely.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.480
Oh, my God.
Really, it's scary.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.636
Yes.

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.594
How did he find us?

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.990
I don't know.
We took every precaution.

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.150
We only used cash.

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.240
No phones.

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:33.840
Morgan.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.480
Hmm?

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.399
Did you call your parents again?

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.629
Yes. I had to.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:43.758
My father was gonna think that I was dead
if he found out about Roger.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.400
So I went to a souvenir shop,
I got a burner phone.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.870
I picked it up. One second,
"Hi, I'm alive."

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.296
And then I threw it in the dumpster.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.471
They can't trace a call
if it's less than two minutes.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.800
- Yeah, that's not a thing anymore.
- That's not a thing!

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.070
Well, I know that now.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:57.880
Ugh...

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.475
Oh, my God.
He's coming back to life.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:01.600
He's reanimating.

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.874
Okay, it's a phone. That makes more sense.

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.553
It needs a thumbprint.

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.838
- There's the thumb.
- Seriously?

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.354
I'm standing, so I can't do it.

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.349
Oh, my God.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:19.795
Ugh.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.156
It says,
"Text me when you get the package."

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.631
Um... Tell him we have the package,
and ask where the drop is.

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.912
Oh, shit. It's locked again. Hold on.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.599
Oh, oh.
He said, "Bring it to Operation Albrecht."

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.719
- Okay.
- What's Operation Albrecht?

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:37.800
I'm checking his emails.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.680
Ah.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.760
He's been communicating
with someone named Hunter Pierce.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:44.990
So a gay porn star.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.953
Uh...

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.430
Highland was planning
to buy the drive from Duffer.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.473
They called it Operation Albrecht.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.515
It's going down tomorrow night.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.679
There's a gala in Berlin
at the Museum of Technology.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.832
Text him back and say
we'll meet them there with the drive.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.117
The phone is locked again.
I need the thumbprint.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520
You know what? Forget it.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.391
Okay.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.994
- Oh, the thumb. Yes.
- Audrey...

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.991
Oh, my God.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.470
Thumbs up.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.596
Go.

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:34.315
So here's the plan.
We go to Berlin.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.996
<i>Wait, we're gonna
walk right into this gala?</i>

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.280
<i>No. We pose
as two people on the guest list.</i>

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.431
<i>The Canadian Ambassador and his wife.</i>

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.456
<i>Uh, won't people know
what they look like?</i>

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:48.320
<i>No. No one
ever remembers what Canadians look like.</i>

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.832
<i>They land at Tegel Airport at 2:00 p.m.</i>

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.830
<i>Can I do an accent?</i>

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.816
- <i>Please don't.
- I know what I'm gonna do.</i>

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.957
Hiya! Is you the Mullicays?

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.315
Perfect. I'm Bill.

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:00.949
I know what you're thinking.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.839
How'd a bloke from the East End
get all the way to Berlin, Germany?

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.159
Well, I will tell you
on the way to the car.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:10.233
I said, "What are you doing here, Queen?"

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.076
She said, "I was bored up in that castle.
I had to get out."

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.239
Okay, let's drive then.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.353
No! We're being robbed.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.318
No! Not again.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.119
- Sorry.
- Please, no.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.714
I've a little girl at home.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.632
- Okay. We gotta go.
- Me wife is dead.

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.856
- Go. Get out. They're asleep.
- She needs a new kidney.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:37.680
- Morgan, no, let's just...
- I came up with a story.

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.755
I hope I look like
the Canadian ambassador's wife.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.036
I hope I look like Chris Kirkpatrick
from NSYNC.

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:11.396
- Am I done?
- Yeah. You're good.

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.256
I just think if one of us is
changing her look,

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.670
then the other should change her look
for disguise reasons.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.356
Like, you're about to look
like Amanda Mullicay.

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.033
And I'm about to look like...

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.836
Shit. I'm about to look like you.

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.476
Not that it's a bad look.
It's just we switched places,

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.416
so if they're looking
for a blonde and a brunette,

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:31.336
then we're still gonna be
a blonde and a brunette.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.396
Oh, we fucked up.

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.910
I hope this isn't
what gets us killed tonight.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.118
No. Hey, we're not gonna die tonight.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.113
You're right, we're not.
But if we do... Just...

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.680
We're not, but if we do...

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.637
Oh, my God.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.440
I know a lot of horrific stuff
has happened this week,

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.000
but, um...

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.479
It has been the best week of my life.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.071
Really?

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.518
Yeah, just being out here, like,
on this adventure, with you,

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:00.874
doing the right thing,
and nobody's judging me...

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:02.076
I don't know.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.674
Do you normally feel judged?

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.479
You know that thing that Drew said to me
about me being a little much?

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.557
It's not the first time I've heard that.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.680
You're not "a little much."

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:15.355
I am. I am "a little much."
I'm a lot much.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.119
No, you're not.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.840
The only people who don't think so
are you and my parents.

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.639
That's 'cause everyone else is boring.

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.839
Sorry.

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.909
I'm so proud of you.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.639
Honey, I'm proud of you.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:35.840
Oh, my God.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.136
- So, don't...
- Don't die, okay?

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.200
Please don't die,
because then I would die,

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.521
and then we would both be dead,
and that would be a waste.

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.838
Morgan. Are you in position?

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.720
Yeah, I was born in position.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.871
Yes, everyone's born in position.

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.191
That's why they call it
the fetal position.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.272
Right. Yeah, I just got that.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.432
- Amanda.
- Ethan.

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:16.760
Just act natural.
Just another normal night.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.391
Yeah.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.616
<i>Performing with Cirque du Soleil
is actually a top three dream of mine.</i>

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.120
I'm highly prepared for this mission.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.595
I was a CIT in Acrobatics
and Clowning at camp.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.238
It was competitive and I excelled.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.676
Once again, Morgan,
you're not performing with the troupe.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.400
Your job is to stay backstage
and watch the surveillance.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.800
<i>We need to locate the buyer.</i>

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.473
Okay. But... But...

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.080
Not just for one song?

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:41.896
- <i>No.</i>
- I hear you.

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.880
But wouldn't I be better able
to identify the mark

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.120
if I was spinning around on
that silver spinning thingy?

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.389
- <i>No.</i>
- Copy that.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.949
But what if I was on the trapeze?
In which I am trained.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.274
- No.
<i>- Affirmative.</i>

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.510
Mongoose standing down.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.436
Hey!

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.989
<i>You guys, you guys,
I see someone suspicious.</i>

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.197
Okay. Stay calm.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.919
<i>- Can you describe them?</i>
- Okay.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.753
He's got an insane twirly mustache.

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.638
<i>He's got the big bushy scary eyebrows.</i>

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.154
And...

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:26.358
Yep. Yep. He's holding a bag of money.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have our buyer.

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.096
Yeah, I think that guy's part of the show.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.880
Yeah, Morgan,
I don't think an actual bad guy

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.792
would look like an evil Mr. Monopoly.

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:32.711
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:35.269
I gotta go with my gut on this. I'm sorry.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.840
Oh.

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.030
And I was mistaken.
He is a part of the show.

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.271
I repeat, he is a part of the show.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:01.914
Oh!

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.759
What?

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.160
That's Tom and Marsha.

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:10.670
Drew's fake parents. Or whoever they are.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.799
Morgan, get backstage. I've been blown.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:26.440
Who has blown you?

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.200
Morgan, it's not funny.

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.360
<i>I agree. There's nothing funny
about you being blown.</i>

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.320
Okay. You two, stay together
and in plain sight until I get back.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.477
You, uh...
You put the drive somewhere safe?

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.200
Very safe.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.960
Is it the same place as last time?

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.720
You'll see.

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:45.592
I don't actually mean, like, you will see.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:47.956
- Please just go.
- Yeah.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:48.917
Okay.

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.434
No smoking, sir.

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.958
Oh. I'm sorry. Awful habit, I know.

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.039
- You want one?
- I don't smoke, sir.

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:12.951
Yeah, neither do I.

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:37.636
Sebastian...

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.916
Sebastian, you got a text.

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.155
Sebastian, is everything okay?

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:17.639
Morgan, Sebastian's not responding.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.313
<i>Oh, my God. That's really bad.</i>

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.676
Or not. I don't wanna scare you.
Could mean anything.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.760
The buyer texted me.
I have to go meet him.

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.271
- Or her.
<i>- Thank you. I was gonna say,</i>

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.999
women can be terrorists, too.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.616
<i>We can do anything we put our minds to.</i>

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.400
Can you see if you can
get eyes on Sebastian?

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:32.560
He couldn't have gotten far.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.600
Okay.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.238
Yeah. In that case,
I am gonna climb the ladder. I know...

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Morgan?

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.600
...trapeze platform really
is the best vantage point.

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:45.680
Morgan?

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.515
Oh, my God.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:07.991
Audrey. Oh, my God.

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.594
What the fuck?

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.555
Okay.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:14.311
Okay.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:20.834
Audrey, the goldfinch has reached
her very precarious perch.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:25.073
I think I'm about, I don't know,
2,000 feet off the ground.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.040
Huh.

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.520
No.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.640
Okay. I'm gonna go. Wait.

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.152
What? Excuse me.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.594
Give me the ladder.

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.200
Fuck me.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.831
- Drew, you're supposed to be dead.
- Dead. Yeah.

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.189
I was right on the edge.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:55.754
But the idea of you being out there
kept me alive.

01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.395
I'm here to save you.

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.759
- Me?
- And to stop Henshaw.

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:04.034
What? Sebastian? No, he's helping us.

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.631
Audrey, do you know about Highland?

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.035
Yeah.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:10.720
Sebastian works for Highland.

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:16.078
No. That's not possible.
Why would he come and risk his life?

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.594
Why would he get fired?

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:20.816
What did he tell you? Did he tell you
you're here to find a buyer for the drive?

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.274
You're just here so he can kill me.

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.990
He was using you as bait to find me.

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.713
He knew that I'd come back for you.

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.474
That I'd never let him hurt you.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:32.720
And now, here I am.

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.160
Yeah.

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.438
Audrey, I have some bad news.

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:40.035
Nadedja is still alive,

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:43.875
and she is on the other trapeze platform
right now.

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.640
She might have a bomb on her.
I don't know.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.632
Maybe this is one
of the terrorist attacks.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:50.680
That doesn't really make any sense.
She doesn't seem like a suicide bomber.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:54.636
That girl has high self-esteem.
She's so full of herself.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:01.433
The point is, Audrey, I'm looking at her,
and she definitely does wanna kill me.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.440
And then she's gonna come after you.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.912
So I think I gotta fix this.

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.876
I can do this.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.710
Remember your training
from the New Jersey Circus Center.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.477
Could I just ask you something?

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.560
Anything.

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.039
Did you leave that drive in my apartment

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.952
because you thought
that I would never leave?

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.357
That I wouldn't grow?
That I wouldn't go anywhere?

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.991
Did you send me to Vienna because you just
assumed that I wouldn't question anything?

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:16.072
No. No. No, no. I mean...

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.755
I underestimated you.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:21.836
You hurt me.

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.280
I'm so sorry.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.040
I had to.

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.752
But now, seeing everything
that you've done,

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.390
I've never loved you more.

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.160
Do you love me?

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.797
I love you, Audrey Stockman.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.636
Looks very real to me.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:01.557
What was the name of the nun that beat you
in whatever fucking orphanage...

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.109
...you grew up in, you skank?

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.839
Ow. Ow.

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:24.271
Audrey. Audrey, I did it.

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:26.760
We're safe.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.760
Audrey?

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.600
Audrey?

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.040
Shit!

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.038
Your boss give you any new spy gadgets?

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.630
Uh, no.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.277
Canadian now?

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.591
- Eh!
- Eh! Good.

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.394
Oh, um... I wouldn't open that.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:48.720
Is that gonna blow my head off?

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:50.880
Hmm?

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:54.320
Thousand guesses,
never would've landed on "thumb."

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.359
Anything else, Double O Sexy?

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.189
The drive isn't in there.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:07.800
Oh, come on.

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:11.636
Hey.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:13.640
You can trust me.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:16.880
Really?

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.193
'Cause you said not to trust anyone.

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:23.776
- Stand back.
- Go on. Move it.

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:24.870
Sebastian?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.356
- Audrey.
- Audrey, step back. He's with them.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:29.680
- Thayer?
- Hey, bro.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.876
Audrey, step away from him.

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:32.875
He's gonna kill all of us.

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:34.994
He said the same thing about you.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Hello.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.872
Thayer, remove the target.

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:45.960
Fuck you, Dad.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.160
Mom.

01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:54.472
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:55.676
Wait! Hold on. Hold on.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.993
Audrey, listen to me.
Drew is working with Highland.

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.794
Sebastian was working with Highland.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:02.757
That's a lie.

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.479
Audrey, he was working with Duffer, too.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.040
Sebastian was working with Duffer.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.736
Drew's the one
that sent the assassin to the gymnasium.

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:09.760
He would've let you die.

01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:12.080
Sebastian sent the assassin
to the gymnasium.

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.400
Sebastian would've let you die.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.496
Okay, everything I say you did
you can't just say I did.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:16.795
I can 'cause I've got the gun.

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:30.080
You okay?

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.196
I'm so scared.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.749
It's all right. It's okay. Shh...

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.953
I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.831
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I know.

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.239
Can we please just go home?

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.436
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:47.034
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:53.670
You looking for this?

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.040
Uh, Audrey, that's...

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:01.161
That's cute, but I don't think
you know what you're doing.

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.516
God, you really do still underestimate me.

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.676
Audrey, come on.

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:07.711
Audrey...

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.631
Get off me! No!

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.516
Oh, my God!

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.399
Oh, Morgan. Always so dramatic.

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.476
Fuck.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:24.755
Oh, God!

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.676
Argh!

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:36.680
You better hurry.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.229
Finish me off.

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:42.480
Oh, that's right.

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.833
You never finish anything.

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.354
To quote a text I got,

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.520
"Hey there. It's over. Sorry."

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.193
Audrey... Audrey, don't.

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:00.760
I lied.

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.960
Drew Thayer,
don't move. You're under arrest.

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.040
<i>We have apprehended Drew Thayer.</i>

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.470
It's a little much, don't you think?

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.837
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:25.078
- I'm okay. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.194
Sebastian?

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.514
What the fuck?

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:40.274
Okay, these vests, they save your life,

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.397
but they do not prevent you
from breaking ribs.

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.630
You're alive.

01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:48.194
Oh, you're alive.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:01.599
What is the Heimlich maneuver?

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:03.400
<i>What is the Heimlich maneuver?</i>

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:05.336
- <i>That's it.
- Instruments for eight.</i>

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.136
<i>This long, powerful horn...</i>

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.480
That's a long number.

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.114
- Oh.
- Hello.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.954
- Mom, I'm alive.
<i>- Honey, are you okay?</i>

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.680
- Let me turn this down.
- Yeah, I'm gonna put you on speaker.

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.616
- Hold on.
<i>- Let me turn the volume down.</i>

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.376
- Put in... Do... Um...
<i>- Trying to lower the volume,</i>

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.392
- sweetie, and I can't.
- Input.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.709
Input? I don't see input.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.838
Sorry, I'm calling
from an international spy's phone.

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:27.036
Spy. Who's a spy?

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.835
Yeah, input's doing nothing.

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:33.836
He's an international spy,
and his name is Sebastian Henshaw.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.310
He works for MI6.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.595
Morgan...

01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:40.798
Can she not reveal my identity?

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.951
Uh, yeah, she tells them everything.

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.838
Hold on. I have a call waiting.

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.240
I love you.

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.037
Sebastian Henshaw's phone.
This is Morgan speaking.

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.120
<i>Where's Henshaw?</i>

01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:58.556
Oh, my God. Is this who I think it is?

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:01.394
How could I possibly know
who you think this is?

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:03.870
<i>Oh, my God. It is you. Wow.</i>

01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.398
I'm letting Audrey and Sebastian
have a little bit of a moment right now.

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.800
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.456
- Tell him to call me back.
<i>- No, no. It's okay.</i>

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:15.474
I think I've proven myself
a trustworthy junior agent.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:16.976
<i>Why don't you give me the message, yeah?</i>

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.195
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:20.112
<i>You may tell him this,</i>

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.192
that he can come back
to the office on Monday.

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:25.239
Really? Oh, my gosh! That's the best.

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:26.736
- Thank you.
<i>- He's gonna be so happy.</i>

01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:27.830
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:30.230
Mon... Oh! Monday is tough for me, though.

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.152
<i>- Hey, okay.</i>
- No, no, no.

01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:34.072
I have a callback
for a Progresso commercial.

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.235
But you know what? Fuck it.

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.496
<i>- I'm gonna cancel it.</i>
- I'm not talking about you, Morgan.

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:39.954
- Do not show up on Monday.
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:44.159
I won't come in on Monday.
Gosh, I wouldn't dream of it.

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.430
Great. Thank you.

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.239
<i>No, but I will. I'll see you Monday.</i>

01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:48.674
What do you like in your coffee?

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:51.832
So when people ask you
about your first trip to Europe...

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.720
I'm gonna have to tell them the truth.

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.599
It definitely wasn't boring.

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:58.400
No.

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:06.080
But I didn't get to do
everything that I wanted to do.

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.917
Oh, yeah? What did you forget?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.912
No. No, no.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.056
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
I thought that you and I maybe...

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:19.991
- No. Actually it was...
- I'm sorry.

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.176
- I was going for the...
- I mean, it was

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.476
- the physical pain of my chest.
- Okay, then suck it up.

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.440
Hey.

01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.439
All for this happening. Love this.

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:50.910
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I just talked to the MI6 lady,

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.390
and she said that you would know
what to do with the drive?

01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:54.630
I have it this time.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.717
You told us to keep it somewhere safe.

01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:00.520
Right. So I finally swallowed it.

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.719
Big personal victory of mine.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:05.351
Well, we need to destroy it.

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:08.116
Yeah. As soon as she clears.

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:09.871
You know what I mean?

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.552
I, um... I should speak to my boss.

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:17.111
Yep. Bye now.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.274
Ahhh!

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:27.718
What? Okay! Okay!

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:31.440
Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes!

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.200
Happy birthday!

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.840
Okay. Blow, baby, blow.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:17.676
Well, I hope your wish
was to be entertained.

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.920
Whoa. Guys, guys, guys.
It's just a microphone.

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:24.512
Although, fair warning.

01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:28.597
<i>You may be blown away.
Two, three, four, hit it.</i>

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:34.679
<i>Audrey, it's so good to be here with you
in Tokyo,</i>

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.672
<i>my steamy little eda-mommy.</i>

01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:39.753
<i>I have loved you since the udon of time.</i>

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:42.639
<i>It's Japanese food puns.
That's the entertainment.</i>

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:48.910
<i>I'm going to sashimi
over here to these very handsome ramen.</i>

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.634
<i>Do you like my food puns?</i>

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.120
<i>Or do you think they're teri-yucky?</i>

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:54.353
<i>Audrey, I love you so much.</i>

01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:55.840
<i>Happy birthday, baby.</i>

01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:59.111
Morgan!

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:02.314
You shouldn't have.

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:03.959
<i>- And yet I did.</i>
- Oh.

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.113
Okay, Morgan. It's time.

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.916
<i>Shumai, my, my! Look at you.</i>

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:13.075
<i>Let's do a little call-and-response
for Audrey's birthday, shall we?</i>

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.914
<i>When I say "happy,"
you say "birthday." Happy...</i>

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:17.511
<i>Happy...</i>

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.431
<i>Audrey,</i>

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:19.590
happy birthday.

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:51.630
<i>I have known Audrey for maybe 15 years,</i>

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:54.599
<i>and, in that time,
she has stayed exactly the same.</i>

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.115
<i>She has not changed one bit,
and so, I think,</i>

01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:59.157
<i>I kind of know her
like the back of my hand,</i>

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.359
<i>and she's a very simple person.</i>

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:04.191
<i>And she just doesn't really have
the mental capacity</i>

01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:06.272
<i>to carry out something like this,
I don't think.</i>

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:07.920
<i>She's a dear friend.</i>

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:11.237
<i>- Yeah.
- They said something about, like...</i>

01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:13.073
<i>They were doing this
for a guy or something.</i>

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.800
<i>Oh, yeah. Like someone died
in front of them or something.</i>

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.792
<i>Like, one of their boyfriends
or something.</i>

01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:19.633
<i>I don't know. It was for love.
I don't know.</i>

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:24.390
<i>Looking in the mirror and seeing the face
of somebody who was friends with her</i>

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.475
<i>has been really tough.</i>

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.315
<i>And I think we all have to remember
the real victims in situations like this</i>

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:31.400
<i>are the friends.</i>

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.391
<i>Are the childhood friends
who were there from day one.</i>

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:36.395
<i>Who have to carry this burden.</i>

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:39.040
<i>And will have to carry...
Sorry.</i>

01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:43.234
<i>And will have to carry this burden
for a long time to come.</i>

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:46.880
<i>If you could
speak to them right now,</i>

01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:47.976
<i>what would you say to them?</i>

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.992
<i>Oh! Give 'em a piece of my mind.</i>

01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:51.310
<i>I want my bum bag back.</i>

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:53.119
<i>Give me my bum bag back for starters.</i>

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:54.793
<i>My passport, my money.</i>

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.270
<i>- Yeah.
- My lip gloss, my keys, my phone.</i>

01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.633
<i>- Everything.
- They just took everything.</i>

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.520
<i>I...</i>

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:06.436
<i>I don't think that Audrey did do this,
but, Audrey, if you did do this,</i>

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:09.560
<i>I forgive you.</i>

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:13.960
<i>If anyone else back in
Australia is watching you right now,</i>

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:15.136
<i>what do you wanna say to them?</i>

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:17.834
<i>- We're having such a good time!
- Such a good time!</i>

01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:20.674
<i>Hi! We're on TV!</i>
