♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.750 --> 00:08.166
( upbeat pop music playing )

00:17.208 --> 00:18.917
Ow. Damn it.

00:18.959 --> 00:20.375
You okay?

00:20.417 --> 00:23.333
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:23.375 --> 00:24.542
What are you doing?

00:24.583 --> 00:26.041
I'm making Lucas
a Halloween costume.

00:26.083 --> 00:29.041
I'm trying to make Lucas
a Halloween costume.

00:29.083 --> 00:30.458
Ow.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.583
( chuckles ):
Uh, you know, I think
they sell costumes.

00:34.625 --> 00:38.041
My mother made these really
great Halloween costumes.

00:38.083 --> 00:40.041
My fourth-grade sunflower
won first prize.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.333
( chuckles )
No, and then one year

00:41.375 --> 00:43.959
I was Raggedy Ann and she made
these authentic pantaloons

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
with a wig made
out of red yarn and--

00:46.041 --> 00:47.834
Well, she actually sewed
me into the pantaloons

00:47.875 --> 00:49.667
and then told me that
I couldn't get out of them,

00:49.709 --> 00:52.333
so, um, I peed my pants
trick-or-treating

00:52.375 --> 00:53.500
and was humiliated

00:53.542 --> 00:55.041
because she's a sadistic
narcissist

00:55.083 --> 00:57.041
with serious intimacy issues,

00:57.083 --> 00:59.750
but she made
really great costumes.

01:01.959 --> 01:03.083
Did you--?
Did you dress up?

01:03.125 --> 01:05.000
You ever go out
trick-or-treating

01:05.041 --> 01:06.041
with your brother?

01:06.083 --> 01:08.291
Adam and I used
to egg trick or treaters.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.250
Oh.

01:10.291 --> 01:11.375
Was that fun?

01:11.417 --> 01:13.000
I'm late for the ER.

01:14.125 --> 01:16.166
Hey, big man.

01:16.208 --> 01:18.625
( Pete grunts )

01:18.667 --> 01:21.083
ALL:
Uh-oh.

01:21.125 --> 01:23.000
Bye. Mwah.
Uh-oh.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.125
You smell good.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.250
Mm.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.709
I taste even better. Ha, ha.

01:32.750 --> 01:36.041
( Cooper moaning )

01:36.083 --> 01:39.291
What are you doing?

01:39.333 --> 01:41.166
It's called foreplay.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.959
Stop looking at my stomach
like that.

01:45.041 --> 01:47.041
Like what?

01:47.083 --> 01:48.959
Like you're trying to picture
a baby in there.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.458
Oh, I'm doing no such thing.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.750
Oh-- Charlotte.

01:55.542 --> 01:56.917
Don't be that way.

01:56.959 --> 01:58.250
( door closes )

02:06.166 --> 02:08.041
SAM:
He's been coming every day
for how long?

02:08.083 --> 02:10.125
GRANT:
Two years ago, weekend ski trip,

02:10.166 --> 02:13.041
Georgie hit a tree,
never regained consciousness.

02:13.083 --> 02:15.250
None of the neuro guys
gave him much hope,

02:15.291 --> 02:16.959
but you're always good
with referrals

02:17.000 --> 02:18.083
and so I just thought, maybe--

02:18.125 --> 02:20.750
We could help him
come to terms with this.

02:21.834 --> 02:23.917
GRANT:
He hasn't let go. At all.

02:23.959 --> 02:25.917
Amelia will be honest with him.

02:27.083 --> 02:29.917
Oh. Uh, bright lights
don't do much for Georgie,

02:29.959 --> 02:31.667
but she likes
being talked to.

02:31.709 --> 02:33.041
( inhales )

02:33.083 --> 02:35.709
See? You can say
it's just a reflex,

02:35.750 --> 02:37.959
all the other doctors did,

02:38.000 --> 02:39.959
but I know
it's more than that.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.500
The trauma to your wife's head

02:41.542 --> 02:43.709
damaged her reticular
activating system,

02:43.750 --> 02:46.166
which controls
her level of consciousness.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.500
Like waking up. I know.

02:48.542 --> 02:49.834
Then you also know

02:49.875 --> 02:52.041
that it is hard to determine
how extensive the damage is?

02:52.083 --> 02:53.959
Which means I could be right,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.542
she hears me
and responds to me.

02:56.583 --> 02:58.125
AMELIA:
It's possible, but

02:58.166 --> 03:01.041
Georgie is only manifesting
very primitive reactions.

03:01.083 --> 03:02.959
I mean, a twitch, a blink.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.625
After all this time,
that doesn't bode well.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.333
Look, I can run
a bunch of tests, but--

03:08.375 --> 03:10.000
Uh, then run them.

03:11.583 --> 03:14.417
I don't want you to get
your hopes up, Mr. Schwartz.

03:14.458 --> 03:15.959
( chuckles )

03:16.000 --> 03:19.041
My hopes are already up.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.041
They have to be.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.250
Run the tests.

03:22.291 --> 03:24.166
( tender theme playing )

03:27.083 --> 03:28.834
( siren wailing )

03:28.875 --> 03:29.834
PETE:
What have we got?

03:29.875 --> 03:32.166
MVA. Car versus pole. Two males.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.542
Jacob Deever, 43 years old,
wearing seatbelt.

03:34.583 --> 03:37.041
Minor facial lacerations
and a bruised arm.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.041
Twenty-two-year-old Evan Arnold,
unrestrained.

03:39.083 --> 03:41.709
Closed head trauma
and possible fractured tibia.

03:41.750 --> 03:45.458
Hey, look, really I'm fine.
I don't need to be here.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.875
Mr. Deever, I'm Dr. Wilder.
We're gonna help you out,

03:47.917 --> 03:49.250
but I need you
to relax for just a minute

03:49.291 --> 03:51.000
while I examine
the other driver.

03:51.041 --> 03:53.458
We were in the same car.
He, uh-- Evan.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.625
He hit his head
on the windshield.

03:55.667 --> 03:57.291
Okay, let's get
a C-spine, chest,

03:57.333 --> 03:59.083
a pelvic trauma panel
and a head CT.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.875
Either of you have
anything to drink?

04:00.917 --> 04:02.000
What? No.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.250
No, I-I just happened
to take my eyes

04:03.291 --> 04:04.458
off the road for a second.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.917
What about drugs,
prescription or otherwise?

04:06.959 --> 04:08.792
No, no. God, no. You know what?

04:08.834 --> 04:10.875
I have an appointment
that I need to get to, so--

04:10.917 --> 04:12.834
Okay, let me just get someone

04:12.875 --> 04:14.333
to clean up that scrape
on your head and--

04:14.375 --> 04:16.625
No. No, it's good. I'm actually
fine. I just need to go.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.917
You have the right
to refuse treatment,

04:18.959 --> 04:21.125
but you're gonna have to talk to
the police about the accident.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.041
Why don't you wait for me
at the nurses' station?

04:23.083 --> 04:25.333
I'll get your statement,
then you can go.

04:29.709 --> 04:31.041
He seems pretty antsy.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.291
Should we hold him
for a tox screen?

04:32.333 --> 04:34.041
That's not why he's nervous.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.250
I know this guy that he's with.

04:35.291 --> 04:37.500
Arrested him a couple times
in the past few months.

04:37.542 --> 04:38.959
He's a prostitute.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.709
( knocking at door )

04:48.750 --> 04:51.500
Hey. You wanna see
something funky?

04:51.542 --> 04:53.792
Thirty-three-year-old woman,
Georgie Schwartz,

04:53.834 --> 04:55.917
persistent vegetative state
for over 24 months.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.125
( groans )

04:57.166 --> 04:59.291
Looks like the case study
from my Neuroanatomy final.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.041
I hated Neuroanatomy.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.583
Just skip down to the labs.

05:04.083 --> 05:07.542
Her TSH is low, but her thyroid
levels look fine.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.875
I don't get it.

05:08.917 --> 05:14.000
Hmm. Iron-deficient anemia. Hmm.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.792
You're focusing
on the wrong organ.

05:17.041 --> 05:18.959
Your patient's pregnant.

05:20.083 --> 05:22.417
All I did was put my hand
on her stomach.

05:22.458 --> 05:25.083
Which is usually the prelude
to a little something-something.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.000
She's got me boxed in.

05:27.041 --> 05:28.000
I know the feeling.

05:28.041 --> 05:29.083
You and Pete aren't having sex?

05:29.125 --> 05:32.375
Uh, no. We have a lot of sex.

05:32.417 --> 05:34.959
Sorry. No, I just meant
the boxed-in part.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.208
Okay, I'm gonna, um--

05:40.458 --> 05:41.750
I'm gonna tell you something,

05:41.792 --> 05:45.041
but you can't ever,
never ever, tell anyone.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.125
Never ever.

05:48.792 --> 05:49.750
Okay.

05:49.792 --> 05:51.166
Never ever.

05:51.208 --> 05:52.250
Never ever.

05:55.125 --> 05:56.875
Pete's mother...

05:58.667 --> 06:00.458
She's in prison.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.250
What?

06:03.291 --> 06:05.250
What, like "prison" prison?

06:05.291 --> 06:07.041
What'd she do?
She like a bunny boiler?

06:07.083 --> 06:08.250
Or like Bonnie and Clyde?

06:08.291 --> 06:10.834
I don't know.
He won't talk about her.

06:10.875 --> 06:12.542
He's got a brother,
he won't talk about him.

06:12.583 --> 06:16.041
Which is obviously wrong.
He should tell me this stuff.

06:16.083 --> 06:21.041
I should know about it, right?
I mean, I'm his wife.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.500
What'd you do?

06:27.542 --> 06:29.041
Nothing.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.625
Violet Maryann Turner.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.959
Okay, I Googled.

06:41.625 --> 06:44.709
There are 33 Adam Wilders.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.208
Mm-hm.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.041
So you think
we can start trying?

06:48.083 --> 06:50.625
Oh, you're healed
from your bladder reconstruction

06:50.667 --> 06:52.208
and your kidney function's
back to normal.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.458
I think you'd be crazy not to.

06:54.500 --> 06:58.375
Laying in that hospital bed,
this always felt so far away.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.834
Sometimes I thought
it would never happen.

07:00.875 --> 07:03.041
But now, I'm ready--

07:03.083 --> 07:05.959
We're ready. --for a baby.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.500
If you want my advice,

07:07.542 --> 07:09.458
forget about ovulation days
and thermometers

07:09.500 --> 07:11.542
and just have fun.

07:12.750 --> 07:16.333
I can't wait to tell my husband.

07:16.375 --> 07:17.834
Hon?

07:17.875 --> 07:21.208
Dr. King,
this is my husband, Jacob.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.208
Nice to meet you.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.458
So nice to meet you.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.709
You okay?
Yeah.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.000
Good.

07:35.625 --> 07:36.583
CHARLOTTE:
Enjoy.

07:36.625 --> 07:38.000
Thanks again.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.500
Hey, Charlotte.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.458
Do you know that guy?

07:44.500 --> 07:46.458
He's the husband
of one of my patients.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.000
Is something wrong?

07:49.834 --> 07:51.709
He was in the ER
a couple of hours ago

07:51.750 --> 07:53.583
with a male prostitute.

07:53.625 --> 07:54.917
( Pete clears throat )

07:54.959 --> 07:56.667
Are you sure?

07:56.709 --> 07:59.083
They were in a car accident.
Same car.

07:59.125 --> 08:02.375
Angela just spent a year in hell
having her bladder reconstructed

08:02.417 --> 08:04.041
so she could have
a baby with that man.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.041
If he's out there
rubbing on some guy,

08:06.083 --> 08:07.125
she needs to know.

08:07.166 --> 08:09.041
Right. Before we destroy
both their lives,

08:09.083 --> 08:10.500
don't you think
we should figure out

08:10.542 --> 08:11.959
exactly what's going on?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.083
A married man gets into a car
wreck on his lunch hour

08:15.125 --> 08:17.041
with some hustler
in the other seat.

08:17.083 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, let's give him
the benefit of the doubt.

08:27.959 --> 08:32.208
So I narrowed it down
to three Adam Wilders.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.291
Oh, no, this is so him.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.291
Do you think so?

08:34.333 --> 08:35.542
Yeah.

08:35.583 --> 08:36.542
Is that Pete in college?

08:36.583 --> 08:37.583
See?

08:37.625 --> 08:39.208
What?

08:39.250 --> 08:40.917
We're looking
for Pete's brother--

08:40.959 --> 08:42.083
Cooper.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.250
Did you remember "never ever"?

08:43.291 --> 08:44.333
Never ever.

08:44.375 --> 08:45.959
( sighs )

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Sorry.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.458
Never ever will I mention this.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.041
Thank you.
Is he missing?

08:52.083 --> 08:54.000
He's-- He's estranged.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.000
Maybe not for long.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.041
Pete doesn't know
that you're doing this?

08:58.083 --> 09:00.500
Well, there's no harm
in looking.

09:00.542 --> 09:02.250
What would Pete's response be?

09:02.291 --> 09:04.417
Well, if I told him
it was for his own good--

09:04.458 --> 09:07.041
Then I'd say,
why are you the one doing this?

09:07.083 --> 09:10.000
And once you find him,
what's the plan?

09:13.917 --> 09:17.083
( heart thumping on speaker)

09:20.291 --> 09:21.291
Is that--?

09:21.333 --> 09:22.959
The baby's heartbeat.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.041
I'm sorry.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.417
Oh, my God.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.250
GRANT:
Can I talk to you for a minute?

09:31.291 --> 09:32.500
Yeah.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.041
I don't know how this happened.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.625
It's pretty clear
how it happened.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.250
We've never had a problem
like this here.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.500
We screen every staff member.
We do background checks.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.083
I've helped take care of their
patients.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.500
It's not that kind of place.

09:49.542 --> 09:51.208
You still need to call
the police.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.500
If you can just give me
a chance to figure this out.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.834
Someone here had sex
with a comatose woman.

09:55.875 --> 09:57.041
That's a crime.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.875
SAM:
Georgie's not
the only victim here.

09:58.917 --> 10:00.041
What does that mean?

10:00.083 --> 10:02.667
Look at her husband.
The man's destroyed.

10:02.709 --> 10:04.125
Our primary interest
here should be

10:04.166 --> 10:05.667
in doing what's best
for the couple.

10:05.709 --> 10:07.208
They've already been
through one trauma.

10:07.250 --> 10:09.250
Instead of putting
them through another,

10:09.291 --> 10:11.834
which Bob would have
to handle on his own,

10:11.875 --> 10:13.125
we need to protect them,
Addison.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.333
Don't even think about it.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.291
( upbeat theme playing )

10:31.333 --> 10:34.041
Do not shut that door.

10:34.083 --> 10:36.709
Do not close those blinds.

10:36.750 --> 10:39.500
Cooper, do not take
your pants off.

10:39.542 --> 10:40.792
We're in the middle of a fight.

10:40.834 --> 10:42.000
I'm calling a truce.

10:46.792 --> 10:49.041
Good luck with that.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.166
COOPER:
You don't--

10:50.208 --> 10:51.583
( Cooper grunting )

11:02.583 --> 11:04.208
What?
You know what.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.208
I do?

11:05.250 --> 11:06.917
We should have called
the police.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.417
Ahh. You're still talking
about the case?

11:08.458 --> 11:10.333
I was right and you were wrong.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.500
Okay.

11:11.542 --> 11:13.750
Okay, I was right?

11:13.792 --> 11:17.041
Okay, you have your opinion,
I have mine.

11:17.083 --> 11:18.959
That was at work,
we're at home now,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.500
so let's not talk
about it anymore

11:20.542 --> 11:21.917
until we're at work again.

11:21.959 --> 11:24.041
What? What is that?
Does that actually work for you?

11:24.083 --> 11:25.083
Leave work at work?

11:25.125 --> 11:27.083
Well, yeah.
That's what me and Naomi--

11:27.125 --> 11:29.083
I am not Naomi.
I know. I know that.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.041
All right, I am mad, Sam.
I know.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.458
My mad doesn't go away
just because I'm at home.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.041
I take my work home with me.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.041
Addison, come on.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.041
I was right and you were wrong.

11:38.083 --> 11:41.667
You know what?
Go home. To your own bed.

11:41.709 --> 11:42.875
No sex for you.

11:42.917 --> 11:44.000
Wait, wait, wait.

11:44.041 --> 11:45.166
So you're punishing
me for having

11:45.208 --> 11:46.792
an opposing
professional opinion

11:46.834 --> 11:48.959
by withholding
sexual favors? Really?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.458
No sex for you.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.792
( stamps )

11:54.291 --> 11:56.583
( light-hearted theme playing )

11:56.625 --> 11:58.375
( Sam chuckles )

11:58.417 --> 12:01.000
Good night, Addison.
Ha, ha.

12:08.083 --> 12:09.792
Look, uh...

12:09.834 --> 12:13.458
You know, I really appreciate
you not calling Angela.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.375
You know, I--
If she knew about...

12:17.417 --> 12:18.375
( chuckles )

12:18.417 --> 12:20.375
It was just a lapse of judgment.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.041
But I was at the gas station,

12:22.083 --> 12:24.458
he asked for a ride
and he seemed harmless, so--

12:24.500 --> 12:28.125
Mr. Deever, don't talk
to me like I'm an idiot.

12:31.291 --> 12:33.250
( scoffs )

12:33.291 --> 12:35.125
Well, what exactly
do you think happened?

12:35.166 --> 12:37.709
Evan's a prostitute.
I think you paid him for sex.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.041
( scoffs )

12:39.083 --> 12:40.291
You think?

12:40.333 --> 12:43.041
( laughs )

12:43.083 --> 12:46.041
Look, I've been married
to my wife for almost 20 years.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.917
I love her.

12:47.959 --> 12:50.917
I would never cheat on her.

12:50.959 --> 12:53.583
And with a man?
That's disgusting.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.291
Are you kidding me
right now?

12:56.333 --> 12:57.542
I'm not here to judge you.

12:57.583 --> 12:59.250
I just want you to understand
that Dr. King

12:59.291 --> 13:01.000
is ready
to talk to your wife.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.166
You leave Angela out of this.
She is none of your business.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.166
And, Dr. Wilder,
nothing happened

13:10.208 --> 13:11.458
between me and that man.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.417
You hear me? Nothing.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.083
This... It doesn't seem real.

13:23.125 --> 13:26.083
You must feel...

13:26.125 --> 13:29.041
Actually, I don't know
how you must feel,

13:29.083 --> 13:30.125
but I want you to know

13:30.166 --> 13:32.083
that I will do everything
I can for your wife.

13:32.125 --> 13:34.792
I'd like to do a full
examination as soon as possible,

13:34.834 --> 13:36.500
and then
I don't see any reason

13:36.542 --> 13:39.792
why we can't terminate
the pregnancy immediately.

13:39.834 --> 13:42.417
Wait. Why?

13:42.458 --> 13:44.291
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:44.333 --> 13:47.041
I-I didn't even ask
about your religious beliefs.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.583
I-I--
I just assumed that,

13:49.625 --> 13:51.083
given how this happened
to Georgie--

13:51.125 --> 13:52.083
No, no.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.500
Why are you talking
about this like

13:53.542 --> 13:55.000
it's a terrible thing?

13:57.000 --> 14:00.667
Mr. Schwartz, do you understand
that Georgie is pregnant

14:00.709 --> 14:05.750
because someone went into her
room and impregnated her?

14:06.875 --> 14:10.166
Not someone, Dr. Montgomery,

14:10.208 --> 14:12.083
it was me.

14:12.125 --> 14:15.417
( dramatic theme playing )

14:19.083 --> 14:20.250
The woman is in a coma, Sam.

14:20.291 --> 14:21.834
She can't move or speak.

14:21.875 --> 14:23.041
Which means she cannot consent.

14:23.083 --> 14:24.667
They're husband and wife.

14:24.709 --> 14:26.041
You think that being married
means

14:26.083 --> 14:27.250
you don't have
the right to say no?

14:27.291 --> 14:28.583
No, I'm not saying that.

14:28.625 --> 14:31.041
The man climbed on top
of a comatose woman--

14:31.083 --> 14:33.750
All right,
I am not defending what Bob did,

14:33.792 --> 14:35.458
but the man is broken.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.834
I mean, you look at him,

14:36.875 --> 14:38.458
you see how
he interacts with her.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.667
He needs counseling,

14:39.709 --> 14:42.041
a way to accept
that she's not coming back.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.333
Bob Schwartz is a sick,
twisted, pervert, right?

14:44.375 --> 14:45.333
Please, tell him.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.583
The husband could be using sex

14:46.625 --> 14:47.792
as an outlet for his grief.

14:47.834 --> 14:49.667
Or if he
truly believes his wife

14:49.709 --> 14:51.083
can feel
and she can respond--

14:51.125 --> 14:53.500
I've seen it before with the
families of comatose patients.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.500
They suffer a loss
that they cannot accept

14:55.542 --> 14:56.709
and they try to ignore it.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.041
These situations are
complicated.

14:58.083 --> 14:59.583
It's not complicated.

14:59.625 --> 15:01.875
We call the police
and they arrest this guy.

15:01.917 --> 15:03.041
SAM:
Oh, come on, Addison.

15:03.083 --> 15:06.041
He is God knows how far
into an emotional breakdown.

15:06.083 --> 15:07.667
He's not out to harm her.

15:07.709 --> 15:11.041
He's deluded.
He bathes her, he feeds her--

15:11.083 --> 15:14.041
He violates her, and now he's
expecting her to have this baby.

15:14.083 --> 15:16.041
I have seen a lot of things
since I became a doctor,

15:16.083 --> 15:17.583
but this is unimaginable.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.041
Have the baby? What, is that
possible with her in a coma?

15:20.083 --> 15:22.041
Probably not.
It's happened.

15:22.083 --> 15:25.208
Rarely, and Georgie's already
at risk of throwing an embolus.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.917
Pregnancy would increase
that tenfold.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.208
I'm not saying I think that
Georgie should have the baby--

15:29.250 --> 15:31.625
Well, unfortunately, Georgie
doesn't have a say in this,

15:31.667 --> 15:33.041
and after I'm done,
neither will Bob.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.208
What are you gonna do?

15:34.250 --> 15:35.709
Take him to court?

15:35.750 --> 15:37.500
Try and strip him
of medical power of attorney?

15:37.542 --> 15:39.500
If I have to, yes.
Addison.

15:39.542 --> 15:41.834
You really disagree with me
on this, Sam? Really?

15:41.875 --> 15:43.250
SHELDON:
Let me to talk to him.

15:43.291 --> 15:46.041
Maybe I can help him understand
why he's doing what he's doing.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.125
I'll chaperone.

15:47.166 --> 15:50.041
We're all pushing in the same
direction, Addison.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.291
( Addison sighs )

15:51.333 --> 15:53.667
All right.
I'll give you a day. One day.

15:53.709 --> 15:56.500
And we're not all pushing
in the same direction, Sam.

15:56.542 --> 15:58.875
I am right. You're wrong.

15:58.917 --> 16:03.291
( upbeat theme playing )

16:08.000 --> 16:10.041
How'd your meeting
go with Jacob?

16:10.083 --> 16:12.375
He claims he didn't know
Evan was a prostitute.

16:12.417 --> 16:13.542
Do you believe him?

16:13.583 --> 16:15.041
Should I?

16:15.083 --> 16:17.917
I tested Jacob's blood for HIV.

16:17.959 --> 16:21.083
Charlotte, you can't test
someone's blood

16:21.125 --> 16:22.083
without their permission.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.709
He came into my hospital.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.917
I'm the chief of staff.

16:24.959 --> 16:26.083
It doesn't give you
the right to--

16:26.125 --> 16:27.792
He's positive.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.125
And in case you're curious,

16:33.166 --> 16:35.375
I checked
Angela's blood too.

16:35.417 --> 16:36.959
She's negative.

16:38.083 --> 16:39.792
We have to tell her.

16:39.834 --> 16:41.500
They're actively trying
to have a child.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.917
It can't come from us.

16:42.959 --> 16:45.166
They made a damn law
that allows us to do it, Pete.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.417
Allows, doesn't require.

16:47.458 --> 16:48.709
( sighs )

16:48.750 --> 16:50.542
Why are you still trying
to protect this guy?

16:50.583 --> 16:51.792
I'm not,

16:51.834 --> 16:53.041
but yanking Jacob
out of the closet

16:53.083 --> 16:54.417
isn't gonna help either of them.

16:54.458 --> 16:57.709
You and I both know
how devastating that would be.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.125
Give me time with Jacob.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.041
Let me get him to see

17:01.083 --> 17:02.542
that he has to be
the one to tell her.

17:02.583 --> 17:05.875
That he owes it to her,
to himself, to tell the truth.

17:05.917 --> 17:08.792
( melancholy pop music
playing )

17:14.250 --> 17:15.291
( knocking on door )

17:17.083 --> 17:18.083
How's the investigation?

17:20.875 --> 17:22.250
Adam Wilder, lawyer in Valencia.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.250
Mm-hm.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.792
He looks okay, doesn't he?

17:24.834 --> 17:26.250
Seems normal.

17:26.291 --> 17:27.542
Pete's been so elusive.

17:27.583 --> 17:29.500
I was expecting
America's most wanted.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.959
Okay.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Read that.

17:36.333 --> 17:37.709
"My name is Violet Turner

17:37.750 --> 17:39.625
and I am married to your
brother, Pete."

17:39.667 --> 17:42.291
Yeah. No. You cannot
send this e-mail.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.709
Pete wants this.

17:43.750 --> 17:46.041
He just-- He just doesn't know
that he wants it.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.834
Oh, come on,
it'll be one of those things.

17:47.875 --> 17:48.917
I'll do it, he'll get pissed

17:48.959 --> 17:50.291
and then he'll thank me
for it later on.

17:50.333 --> 17:51.792
This is Pete.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.834
You remember Pete? The man still
hates his dead wife.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.000
Not a forgiver.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.250
He's in pain, Cooper.

17:56.291 --> 17:59.041
No, you should have seen him.
He's in pain.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.083
And I wanna help him.
I have to help him.

18:01.125 --> 18:03.041
Is this helping?

18:04.083 --> 18:07.041
You press send, that is contact.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.000
You can't undo it.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.750
( door closes )

18:25.500 --> 18:27.709
So am I sleeping here tonight
or next door?

18:28.917 --> 18:29.917
Whatever.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.083
So, what, we're ignoring
each other now?

18:50.125 --> 18:53.083
I am trying not to say things
I can't take back.

18:53.125 --> 18:54.917
( sighs ):
Addison, Bob Schwartz--

18:54.959 --> 18:58.375
I am trying not to say things
I can't take back.

18:58.417 --> 19:05.291
Bob Schwartz has nothing to do
with you and me, here and now.

19:05.333 --> 19:06.917
How can you act like
nothing's wrong?

19:06.959 --> 19:08.083
Like today didn't even happen?

19:08.125 --> 19:09.500
We disagreed about something.

19:09.542 --> 19:10.875
A huge something.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.959
Look, Addison,
if working with you means

19:14.000 --> 19:15.959
we can only be together
when we agree--

19:16.000 --> 19:19.500
Sex. You wanna have sex.
Is that all you think about?

19:19.542 --> 19:22.125
Yeah, Addison. That's all I ever
think about. All day long.

19:22.166 --> 19:25.333
How I can't wait to get home
and have sex with you.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.417
Then let's do it.
Come on, let's have sex.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.792
I'll lie here, dead and still,

19:29.834 --> 19:32.959
and you can have all the sex
you want with my body.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.625
Go ahead, knock yourself out.
Have a ball.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.166
We'll be like
Bob and Georgie Schwartz.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.417
Or is that something
that you and Nai used to do too?

19:46.333 --> 19:50.000
I told you I was trying not
to say things I can't take back.

19:50.041 --> 19:52.250
You should have tried harder.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.709
( sighs )

19:57.709 --> 20:02.041
( upbeat theme playing )

20:03.667 --> 20:05.041
You know what I love
about this place?

20:05.083 --> 20:06.834
None of this toting
around thermoses,

20:06.875 --> 20:10.959
just good old environmentally
unsound, non-biodegradable,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.458
here-for-a-thousand-years
plastic bottles.

20:13.500 --> 20:17.125
Where are you off to
all cheerful this morning?

20:17.166 --> 20:21.000
Sheldon and I are gonna go talk
to your buddy Bob Schwartz.

20:22.375 --> 20:24.000
Is Sam going with you?

20:25.083 --> 20:26.750
Shouldn't you know that?

20:32.041 --> 20:33.500
We're fighting over that case.

20:33.542 --> 20:34.834
Seriously?

20:34.875 --> 20:36.458
He is wrong.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.041
And he compared me to Naomi.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.041
Well, he didn't really,

20:40.083 --> 20:43.041
but he kind of did
and then I-- Whatever.

20:43.083 --> 20:45.875
We're arguing about
the case and he's wrong.

20:45.917 --> 20:49.583
You know he has a right
to his own medical opinion?

20:49.625 --> 20:51.625
If I could come home
to a guy like that,

20:51.667 --> 20:54.750
I would not be wasting my time
arguing about work.

21:14.083 --> 21:16.542
( sighs )

21:16.583 --> 21:19.750
Why can't you just
stay out of my life? Hmm?

21:19.792 --> 21:21.583
Please.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.333
PETE:
You didn't return my call.

21:25.375 --> 21:28.291
Okay, you are
not listening to me.

21:28.333 --> 21:29.458
You're HIV positive.

21:29.500 --> 21:30.959
( dramatic theme playing )

21:31.000 --> 21:33.041
What?

21:33.083 --> 21:34.291
( scoffs )

21:34.333 --> 21:35.583
What are you talking about?

21:35.625 --> 21:38.000
We took blood from you
when you were in the ER.

21:39.333 --> 21:40.959
Well, that just can't be.

21:47.125 --> 21:48.750
( sighs )

21:55.792 --> 21:58.000
So, what?

21:59.417 --> 22:01.333
( sighs )

22:01.375 --> 22:03.583
God, what am I supposed
to do now?

22:05.417 --> 22:07.625
There's someone I'd like you
to talk to.

22:10.166 --> 22:13.542
( man speaking indistinctly
over radio )

22:16.750 --> 22:18.041
AMELIA:
Bob? What happened?

22:18.083 --> 22:20.291
She started bleeding. At first,
just a little and then--

22:20.333 --> 22:22.083
I'm having trouble
keeping her pressure up.

22:22.125 --> 22:24.083
Start a second line.
I'm calling Addison.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.709
Are you sure she's the best one?

22:25.750 --> 22:28.542
If you love your wife,
Mr. Schwartz, she's the one.

22:34.166 --> 22:37.125
I was just curious.

22:37.166 --> 22:39.625
It only happened
one time. That's it.

22:39.667 --> 22:42.250
PETE:
You couldn't already
be HIV positive

22:42.291 --> 22:45.000
from whatever happened with you
and that guy in the car.

22:49.250 --> 22:50.625
( sighs )

22:50.667 --> 22:53.875
There's nothing wrong
with having sex with men.

22:53.917 --> 22:56.750
VIOLET:
But there is something wrong
with you living a lie like this.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.667
I'm not lying.

22:58.709 --> 23:01.667
So you know, withholding
the fact you're HIV positive

23:01.709 --> 23:03.792
from your sexual partners could
land you in prison.

23:03.834 --> 23:05.750
Oh, please.
Look, no--

23:05.792 --> 23:06.917
Jacob. Jacob.

23:10.542 --> 23:12.834
Do you enjoy being intimate
with your wife?

23:16.083 --> 23:19.500
I enjoy making my wife happy.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.041
That's not really
the same thing.

23:24.083 --> 23:27.667
( tender theme playing )

23:31.083 --> 23:34.041
I-I just don't wanna
hurt her, okay?

23:34.083 --> 23:36.375
That's it. I want everything
that everyone else wants.

23:36.417 --> 23:39.250
You know, I wanna be happy.

23:39.291 --> 23:40.709
Be normal.

23:40.750 --> 23:43.041
You can.

23:43.083 --> 23:46.208
You can be happy
and normal, and gay.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.917
But as long
as you're hiding this,

23:48.959 --> 23:50.709
how can you really be happy?

23:50.750 --> 23:53.125
And until you're
honest with Angela--

23:53.166 --> 23:54.500
JACOB:
No, no, no.

23:54.542 --> 23:59.417
Everything that we have,
our marriage, maybe even a baby,

23:59.458 --> 24:02.125
I just-- I can't take
that away from her.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.458
But she's never really gonna
have that anyway.

24:06.083 --> 24:07.500
And if you are honest with her--

24:07.542 --> 24:08.750
How?

24:15.709 --> 24:18.250
God, how can I tell her?

24:20.375 --> 24:22.000
Shouldn't be much longer now.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.959
Georgie hates
hospitals.

24:28.041 --> 24:29.792
She's not gonna like it here.

24:31.542 --> 24:34.542
Bob, you talk about Georgie
like she's present.

24:34.583 --> 24:37.792
She is present. For me.

24:37.834 --> 24:40.125
Physically, yes.
But emotionally--

24:42.083 --> 24:43.709
I'm sure it's very difficult
for you.

24:48.125 --> 24:50.000
The hardest part

24:51.375 --> 24:53.041
is her not being able to talk.

24:53.083 --> 24:54.917
( tender theme playing )

24:54.959 --> 24:56.709
Whenever
anything bad happens,

24:56.750 --> 24:58.542
she always knows
what to say.

24:58.583 --> 25:00.959
You know, what
the silver lining is and...

25:02.125 --> 25:05.291
I always wonder
what she'd say about this.

25:05.333 --> 25:10.041
She'd be appreciative, I'm sure,
of everything you're doing.

25:10.083 --> 25:12.709
But you understand
that even after the tests

25:12.750 --> 25:14.417
that Dr. Shepherd ran,

25:14.458 --> 25:16.709
it's very unlikely
that Georgie will ever be

25:16.750 --> 25:19.542
anything like the woman
you married.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.000
Are you trying to get me
to walk away from her?

25:25.041 --> 25:29.000
I'm trying to get you to think
realistically about your future.

25:32.083 --> 25:34.542
She's my best friend.

25:34.583 --> 25:37.125
I've never ever...

25:37.166 --> 25:38.583
She was my first

25:38.625 --> 25:40.041
and she's supposed
to be my last,

25:40.083 --> 25:41.542
till death do us part.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.458
I can't just...

25:43.500 --> 25:45.750
She's my best friend.
I-I can't abandon her.

25:45.792 --> 25:49.291
W-We're supposed to die
in each other's arms.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.417
If she loved you
half as much as you say,

25:53.458 --> 25:55.667
she wouldn't want this for you.

25:55.709 --> 25:57.208
She'd want you
to be loved by someone

25:57.250 --> 25:58.625
who can love you back.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.750
She'd want you happy.

26:00.792 --> 26:02.500
I'm not saying
give up on her, Bob.

26:02.542 --> 26:04.000
I'm just saying...

26:04.041 --> 26:06.000
don't give up on yourself.

26:10.083 --> 26:11.208
Hi.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.875
Hi.

26:12.917 --> 26:14.000
Nice job with Jacob today.

26:14.041 --> 26:15.041
Thanks.

26:15.083 --> 26:17.041
Look what I bought.

26:17.083 --> 26:18.875
Ha, ha.
It's a pumpkin,

26:18.917 --> 26:21.041
and it's not plastic or cheap.

26:21.083 --> 26:24.041
It's a handmade pumpkin costume.

26:24.083 --> 26:27.041
So that Lucas can have
all the happy childhood memories

26:27.083 --> 26:29.000
and you can keep your thumbs.

26:31.709 --> 26:32.917
I found Adam.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.125
What?

26:34.166 --> 26:35.125
Your brother.

26:35.166 --> 26:37.041
I know who Adam is.

26:37.083 --> 26:39.500
He lives in--
Stop talking.

26:39.542 --> 26:41.667
Why are you so obsessed
with this?

26:41.709 --> 26:43.041
It's my job to care.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.291
You're shrinking me?

26:44.333 --> 26:46.291
No, as-- As your wife.

26:46.333 --> 26:48.834
It's my job
to care as your wife.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.750
Look, I know this is difficult,
but he's your family.

26:51.792 --> 26:53.041
We're strangers, Violet.

26:53.083 --> 26:56.041
We were split up as teenagers,
we went to different houses,

26:56.083 --> 26:57.041
I haven't talked to him since.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.709
So maybe this is a good time
to reach out.

27:01.250 --> 27:07.041
Okay, for a second,
I will be a shrink. All right?

27:07.083 --> 27:09.166
This emotional disconnect
from your past,

27:09.208 --> 27:10.917
from who you were,

27:10.959 --> 27:13.542
it's damaging, it's unhealthy.

27:13.583 --> 27:16.041
And it can affect your
relationships down the line.

27:16.083 --> 27:20.959
With a child, with a spouse.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.083
( tender theme playing )

27:25.125 --> 27:27.333
I have to go back to work.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.959
Your wife is okay, Mr. Schwartz.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.625
Her cervix dilated

27:41.667 --> 27:44.041
and the placenta
detached, but she's alive.

27:44.083 --> 27:46.000
( exhales )

27:46.041 --> 27:47.709
And the baby?

27:47.750 --> 27:49.583
We lost him.

27:52.250 --> 27:53.500
I'm sorry.

27:53.542 --> 27:56.041
( crying )

27:56.083 --> 27:58.125
( dramatic theme playing )

28:05.959 --> 28:08.500
You think Jacob's ever gonna
come back here and tell him?

28:08.542 --> 28:09.959
I think he's a little
more concerned

28:10.041 --> 28:11.333
about telling his wife.

28:11.375 --> 28:12.834
( sighs )

28:12.875 --> 28:14.792
Then allow me.

28:16.083 --> 28:18.041
Mr. Arnold.

28:18.083 --> 28:19.834
Do you practice safe sex
with all your tricks?

28:19.875 --> 28:22.750
Always.
CHARLOTTE: That's good.

28:22.792 --> 28:25.625
Because the man you got into
the accident with, Jacob Deever,

28:25.667 --> 28:27.875
tested positive for HIV.

28:27.917 --> 28:29.792
We'd be happy to test you,
if you'd like,

28:29.834 --> 28:32.208
but if you're telling the truth
about using condoms,

28:32.250 --> 28:33.667
it's not likely to be a problem.

28:33.709 --> 28:34.875
You don't understand.

28:34.917 --> 28:37.667
I said I practice safe sex
with my tricks,

28:37.709 --> 28:40.000
not with the man I love.

28:42.375 --> 28:45.917
( dramatic theme playing )

28:47.542 --> 28:49.041
ADDISON:
Hey. How's Georgie?

28:49.083 --> 28:50.583
She's stable. Bob's with her.

28:50.625 --> 28:51.875
Great.

28:51.917 --> 28:53.917
Unfortunately, he's less stable.

28:53.959 --> 28:55.667
How much less stable can he be?

28:55.709 --> 28:57.875
Well, losing Georgie,
for the most part anyway,

28:57.917 --> 28:59.041
and now the baby.

28:59.083 --> 29:00.750
I mean,
these are profound losses.

29:00.792 --> 29:02.875
He's confused and hurting.

29:02.917 --> 29:04.041
But I talked to him
about coming in

29:04.083 --> 29:06.834
to start working on his
recovery, so...

29:06.875 --> 29:08.667
Good luck.
Right.

29:08.709 --> 29:09.917
AMELIA:
Come on, Addie.

29:09.959 --> 29:11.458
They give child molesters
their kids back

29:11.500 --> 29:12.834
if they get enough counseling.

29:12.875 --> 29:15.834
Really? You're starting
to sound like Sam.

29:15.875 --> 29:19.041
Sam is not all wrong.

29:19.083 --> 29:21.917
I have to go check
up on Georgie.

29:23.250 --> 29:25.125
BOB:
...because you and I,
we never give up.

29:25.166 --> 29:27.125
We stick it out.

29:27.166 --> 29:30.375
We never let anything
get in the way of us.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.834
Sweetie,

29:35.875 --> 29:38.917
I'm sorry to tell you,

29:40.500 --> 29:42.709
we lost our baby.

29:42.750 --> 29:45.959
There was nothing they could do.

29:47.959 --> 29:51.041
But you know what?
Don't worry,

29:51.083 --> 29:53.709
because we'll keep trying.

29:53.750 --> 29:57.458
We're gonna have
a family one day, Georgie.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.000
( tense theme playing )

30:07.834 --> 30:09.542
COOPER:
Charlotte just hung up on me.

30:09.583 --> 30:12.375
She literally hung up the phone
while I was mid-sentence.

30:13.709 --> 30:15.875
I mean, I'm horny.

30:15.917 --> 30:18.041
And she's mad, and horny.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.000
What am I supposed to do?

30:20.041 --> 30:23.709
Well, when you're boxed in,
you need to get out of the box.

30:23.750 --> 30:25.291
How do I do that?

30:27.083 --> 30:29.041
Do something you've
never done before.

30:29.083 --> 30:30.333
Like what?

30:30.375 --> 30:31.542
I don't know, Coop.

30:31.583 --> 30:33.041
I got stuff on my mind.

30:33.083 --> 30:35.125
Can you just figure
it out for yourself?

30:36.542 --> 30:38.125
Finish the e-mail
to Pete's brother?

30:38.166 --> 30:39.500
Yeah. I don't know what to do.

30:39.542 --> 30:40.917
Do I send it? Do I erase it?

30:40.959 --> 30:43.834
I think you need to figure
that out for yourself.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.625
I just think, with Adam,
we could have a family.

30:45.667 --> 30:47.125
You know? A real family.

30:47.166 --> 30:48.375
Pete could have a brother,

30:48.417 --> 30:51.709
I could learn
more about who Pete is and...

30:51.750 --> 30:54.041
Okay, that was about me,
and I know this isn't about me--

30:54.083 --> 30:55.041
Well, it's a bit about me.

30:55.083 --> 30:57.208
Violet, uh--
I mean, he might get mad.

30:57.250 --> 30:59.041
Okay, he will get really mad.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.625
And what if he and Adam
don't like each other as adults?

31:01.667 --> 31:04.041
Or what if Adam doesn't like
kids and he's not nice to Lucas?

31:04.083 --> 31:06.208
What if he's mean to Lucas?
I'm staying silent.

31:06.250 --> 31:08.417
But a real family, that's worth
fighting for. Right?

31:08.458 --> 31:10.542
And I think Pete's--
I think he wants to fix this.

31:10.583 --> 31:12.583
It's the right thing to do.
I know it is.

31:12.625 --> 31:14.000
It's the right thing to do.

31:17.083 --> 31:20.000
Mm-- Mm-mm. Mm.

31:20.041 --> 31:21.125
What did you do?

31:21.166 --> 31:22.625
Pressed send.

31:22.667 --> 31:24.542
Done. Ship sailed.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.208
You're mad?

31:26.250 --> 31:28.041
Do you know what this is gonna
do to my marriage?

31:28.083 --> 31:30.792
To Pete? Did--?
Have you lost your mind?

31:30.834 --> 31:32.000
I didn't send it.

31:33.333 --> 31:36.041
Ow. I was just trying to help
you make up your mind.

31:36.083 --> 31:37.500
( sighs )

31:37.542 --> 31:39.000
I know. I'm just--

31:40.417 --> 31:42.667
I'm frustrated.

31:43.750 --> 31:45.250
Why won't Pete talk to me?

31:49.709 --> 31:51.208
ANGELA:
So is everything okay?

31:51.250 --> 31:53.792
Please tell me it's not
my bladder again.

31:53.834 --> 31:55.709
No.

31:55.750 --> 31:58.875
I didn't call you in to talk
about getting pregnant.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.667
( tense theme playing )

32:09.083 --> 32:11.291
JACOB:
Angela, I do love you.

32:11.333 --> 32:13.583
I've always loved you.

32:14.792 --> 32:16.458
I love what we have together.

32:22.291 --> 32:26.667
But what Evan
and I share is, um...

32:26.709 --> 32:29.000
It's-- It's different.

32:31.125 --> 32:32.875
I don't expect you
to understand that--

32:32.917 --> 32:33.917
Jacob, I know.

32:35.709 --> 32:37.709
I've always known.

32:37.750 --> 32:41.959
Not about Evan,
but about who you really are.

32:43.709 --> 32:46.792
You don't spend 20 years
with someone and not know.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.959
( scoffs )

32:52.375 --> 32:55.000
Okay, you have to know
I didn't mean to hurt you.

32:55.041 --> 32:57.125
I know I should be enraged.

32:57.166 --> 33:01.041
I know I should be screaming,

33:01.083 --> 33:02.667
but all I can think about

33:02.709 --> 33:06.250
is how hard this must
have been for you.

33:06.291 --> 33:07.417
( tender theme playing )

33:07.458 --> 33:12.375
All the pretending.
Living two lives.

33:12.417 --> 33:15.667
Not being yourself.

33:19.125 --> 33:23.041
Ha, ha. God, I'm so healthy.

33:23.083 --> 33:24.750
I was gonna say.

33:24.792 --> 33:26.834
Listen, I wasn't completely
pretending, okay?

33:26.875 --> 33:28.792
My feelings for you are real.

33:28.834 --> 33:30.709
I just didn't know.

33:30.750 --> 33:35.583
When we first met,
I didn't know who I was, okay?

33:37.750 --> 33:40.125
Or maybe I did
and I just didn't wanna know.

33:42.750 --> 33:44.583
I just didn't wanna know.

33:46.250 --> 33:50.000
But now you know,
and that's good.

33:51.083 --> 33:53.041
That's a good thing.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.250
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.875
We will always be friends.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.166
( sobbing )

34:06.208 --> 34:08.917
It's okay. I'll be okay.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.583
Take care of him.

34:16.083 --> 34:18.917
I will. Thank you.

34:18.959 --> 34:21.208
( sniffles )

34:22.917 --> 34:25.041
I'm going to, um...

34:26.291 --> 34:28.000
I'm going to go.

34:30.542 --> 34:32.750
There's something else
you need to tell her, Jacob.

34:46.917 --> 34:48.917
Evan and I...

34:50.417 --> 34:53.542
We are both HIV positive.

34:55.083 --> 34:56.041
Wh--?

34:58.375 --> 35:01.041
PETE:
You're negative, Angela.

35:01.083 --> 35:03.041
We'll test you again
in six months.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.458
( Angela crying )

35:09.458 --> 35:10.917
Angela, please.

35:10.959 --> 35:12.041
( Jacob grunts )

35:12.083 --> 35:15.041
( Angela crying )

35:17.750 --> 35:20.583
( tender theme playing )

35:26.291 --> 35:27.333
Hey.

35:28.917 --> 35:31.083
What are you doing
at your house?

35:31.125 --> 35:35.000
Well, I wasn't having
much luck at your house.

35:38.750 --> 35:40.208
You wanna try again?

35:41.625 --> 35:43.166
Do you?

35:47.542 --> 35:50.083
I called the police on Bob.

35:50.125 --> 35:53.083
I turned him
in for molesting his wife.

35:57.083 --> 35:59.542
All right. Give me a sec.
I'll be right over.

35:59.583 --> 36:01.083
Wait, you're not mad?

36:02.333 --> 36:03.291
You think I'm right.

36:03.333 --> 36:05.083
No.

36:05.125 --> 36:07.750
I'm furious. You were wrong.

36:07.792 --> 36:11.583
That man needed counseling.
He needed...

36:12.667 --> 36:14.291
I was right and you were wrong.

36:14.333 --> 36:18.083
But that was at work.

36:18.125 --> 36:20.709
We're at home now.

36:20.750 --> 36:24.000
I'm gonna practice
what I preach, and, uh...

36:25.083 --> 36:27.041
I'll yell at you tomorrow.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.625
So tomorrow we'll fight?

36:32.083 --> 36:34.000
But tonight--
Sex for me.

36:38.250 --> 36:39.667
Sex for you.

36:39.709 --> 36:42.041
Okay. I only got a half an hour

36:42.083 --> 36:44.041
because I'm supposed
to meet Cooper for drinks.

36:44.083 --> 36:47.667
Then we'd
better make it count.

36:47.709 --> 36:50.000
( upbeat theme playing )

36:53.000 --> 36:55.208
Hold that pose.
I'll be right over.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.583
Sex for me.

37:00.083 --> 37:01.333
MAN:
I just need to see a doctor.

37:01.375 --> 37:03.041
You need to take it easy.

37:03.083 --> 37:04.041
MAN:
Are you a real doctor?

37:04.083 --> 37:05.083
I told you to pipe down.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.583
Now sit down and wait your turn.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.792
Someone will be
with you in a minute.

37:08.834 --> 37:09.792
MAN:
Pipe down.

37:09.834 --> 37:11.041
Lively in here tonight, huh?

37:11.083 --> 37:12.667
Halloween brings
out the crazies.

37:12.709 --> 37:13.709
Mm.

37:13.750 --> 37:14.792
What's that?

37:14.834 --> 37:17.500
Oh, this?

37:17.542 --> 37:20.041
Uh, this is a miniature
Alabama Lane cake

37:20.083 --> 37:22.041
that was made just for you.

37:22.083 --> 37:24.709
Is that how we make up now?

37:24.750 --> 37:26.041
With sweets?

37:26.083 --> 37:27.458
No, no. This is a bribe.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.875
This is how we make up:

37:29.917 --> 37:34.041
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so, so sorry.

37:34.083 --> 37:36.458
There will be no more
baby talk. No pressure.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.291
I mean, I don't even
wanna see a baby.

37:38.333 --> 37:40.500
Ew. Babies. Mm.

37:40.542 --> 37:44.500
I just
want to see you happy.

37:44.542 --> 37:46.750
You're very cute
when you're lying.

37:48.542 --> 37:53.250
And maybe we can practice
not making a baby.

37:53.291 --> 37:55.291
I plan on that.

37:55.333 --> 37:57.250
Okay.

37:57.291 --> 38:00.959
( tender pop music playing )

38:03.166 --> 38:05.709
PETE:
One, two, three. Whoo!

38:05.750 --> 38:07.208
VIOLET:
Isn't this fun?

38:07.250 --> 38:08.625
Actually, it is.

38:08.667 --> 38:10.291
I can see the merits
of your family tradition.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.125
I thought Halloween
wasn't your thing.

38:12.166 --> 38:15.291
But it's your thing,
so now it's our thing.

38:15.333 --> 38:17.041
Hey, okay, Lucas.
Go ahead.

38:17.083 --> 38:19.041
Go ahead, Lucas.
Go with Anna. Go with Anna.

38:19.083 --> 38:21.083
There you go.

38:25.750 --> 38:28.041
Okay, um...

38:28.083 --> 38:31.041
I'm going crazy.
I'm not enjoying this.

38:31.083 --> 38:32.125
I know I should be,
but I'm not.

38:32.166 --> 38:35.250
I, um...

38:35.291 --> 38:37.041
I almost sent an e-mail today
to your brother.

38:37.083 --> 38:38.667
Violet--

38:38.709 --> 38:40.041
You have to give me
something.

38:40.083 --> 38:43.041
I mean, I need to feel
like I know you.

38:43.083 --> 38:45.000
I need to feel
like you want me to know you.

38:46.417 --> 38:49.583
Please. I mean, obviously
your mom did something

38:49.625 --> 38:52.041
to land herself in prison,
but your brother--

38:52.083 --> 38:54.583
What is it about your family
that makes you so angry?

38:54.625 --> 38:56.041
I'm gonna tell the story once

38:56.083 --> 38:58.375
and I'm never gonna
tell it again. Okay?

39:02.834 --> 39:06.000
( scoffs ):
My mother...

39:06.041 --> 39:08.917
She liked to have a good time.
She was a party all by herself.

39:08.959 --> 39:10.709
And my brother--

39:10.750 --> 39:14.834
Adam made excuses for her
because he thought she--

39:14.875 --> 39:17.208
I was the one that cleaned
the vomit off the floor.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.041
I was the one that woke
her up twice a night

39:19.083 --> 39:20.417
to make sure
she was still breathing.

39:20.458 --> 39:24.041
She was a drunk.
And she was...

39:24.083 --> 39:26.041
beautiful,

39:26.083 --> 39:28.250
so there were men.

39:28.291 --> 39:29.667
Lots of men.

39:29.709 --> 39:31.667
And I don't even know

39:33.834 --> 39:36.417
who my father is.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.625
Anyway, finally,
there was Henry.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.041
( clears throat ):
I have no idea what
he saw in her,

39:41.083 --> 39:45.250
but he was the first man I ever
met who didn't ignore me.

39:45.291 --> 39:48.625
I was 13 and he was the first
good man I ever knew.

39:48.667 --> 39:51.000
Which, now I think--

39:52.083 --> 39:53.500
H-He took us to ball games,

39:53.542 --> 39:56.542
helped me with my homework,
told me I could be a doctor.

39:57.667 --> 40:00.792
And things were steady,
things were good.

40:00.834 --> 40:02.667
But even though Henry
was living with us,

40:02.709 --> 40:05.041
even though he wanted
to marry her,

40:05.083 --> 40:08.041
there were a lot of men again.

40:08.083 --> 40:10.083
One morning she came
in the kitchen,

40:10.125 --> 40:11.917
she'd been out all night,

40:11.959 --> 40:13.500
and he was there
packing to leave,

40:13.542 --> 40:15.250
because I guess he'd had it,

40:15.291 --> 40:16.625
and she starts screaming.

40:16.667 --> 40:18.041
I didn't know what was
happening.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.041
And then they're in the kitchen,
she's screaming

40:20.083 --> 40:23.375
and then she's hitting him,
he's defending himself,

40:23.417 --> 40:26.417
and then she gets
a knife and then...

40:26.458 --> 40:29.000
And then he was dead, and...

40:32.959 --> 40:34.542
He was a good guy.

40:37.458 --> 40:40.083
Then I called the cops on her.

40:40.125 --> 40:44.542
And Adam, he lied for her.
He testified for her.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.542
That's why she only got
manslaughter.

40:48.375 --> 40:50.542
You think there's good
in everyone, Violet.

40:50.583 --> 40:52.458
It's not true.

40:52.500 --> 40:55.667
There's no good there.

40:55.709 --> 41:01.417
My family is garbage
and I won't go back.

41:01.458 --> 41:02.667
Okay?

41:02.709 --> 41:04.709
Okay.

41:04.750 --> 41:07.000
ANNA: There we go.
VIOLET: Hi, bud.

41:08.083 --> 41:09.291
Hi.

41:09.333 --> 41:10.792
PETE:
Are we done?

41:10.834 --> 41:12.291
Because I have a shift in the ER

41:12.333 --> 41:15.333
and I wanna go start work early.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.000
Yeah, we're done.
PETE: Okay.

41:18.041 --> 41:19.041
( Lucas babbles )

41:19.083 --> 41:20.583
Yeah.

42:01.834 --> 42:03.750
( both grunt )

42:03.792 --> 42:07.125
( screaming in muffled voice )

42:07.166 --> 42:10.166
( both grunting )

42:22.083 --> 42:24.000
( upbeat theme playing )
