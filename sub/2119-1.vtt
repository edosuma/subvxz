MAN ON RADIO: Turning now to the weather
for your Thursday morning...

06:11.920 --> 06:13.420
here in Bristol Falls.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.540
We have mostly cloudy skies at the moment,
variable light winds...

06:16.640 --> 06:18.980
You can fieldstrip an M4 in the dark.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.500
You still can't tie a damn tie.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.140
...the upper 50s,
which will give way to clouds.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.925
Tomorrow's weather looks like
a carbon copy of today...

06:27.040 --> 06:29.620
With rain likely hitting
our area all weekend.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.540
Showers likely hitting around evening,

06:31.640 --> 06:35.725
then cloudy with a chance of showers
after midnight, with lows in the 50s.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.409
...with your updated
weather forecast here for Bristol Falls.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.620
- New guy.
- Yeah.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.007
Jake Carter. Ex-jarhead.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.164
- Hometown hero last year.
- That's him.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.660
I'll call you when we have the package.

07:10.760 --> 07:11.761
Carter.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.883
I'm Robert Daniels, team leader.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.604
- When did you get in?
- Last night, sir.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.060
I studied your file, Sergeant.

This is your fresh start, Carter.

Gentlemen.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.244
Department of Justice
is flying in a high-value package.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.980
We've been hired
to protect said package...

07:41.080 --> 07:43.460
until DOJ takes official custody.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.089
Robert Daniels,
Global Hawthorne Security.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.940
- I'll be damned. Jake Carter.
- Morning, Lieutenant.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.202
Don't you salute me. I'll kick your ass.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.209
I'm just a lowly civil servant now.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.260
Never thought I'd see you
in a monkey suit, Jake.

09:06.360 --> 09:10.046
- But I got to tell you, it looks ridiculous.
- Thank you, sir.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.128
Let's go, Miss Tanis.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.460
Where the hell are we?

09:17.560 --> 09:20.803
You are back in the United States
of America. That's all that matters.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.740
She still pissed?

09:29.840 --> 09:31.660
She told us to keep our distance.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.340
She's a little high-strung.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.180
Took a swing at one of my guys
for telling her to relax.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.820
Who is she?

09:37.920 --> 09:40.180
Olivia Tanis, 24 years old.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.860
She's smart. IQ, 135.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.580
She's also a whistle-blower.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.260
She's been
on the run overseas for weeks.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.860
We caught up with her in Hong Kong.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.260
Flew her into Vancouver this morning
and then hopped out here.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.500
She's got intel on traitors
inside Genesis Defense Corporation,

09:53.600 --> 09:55.060
where she used to work.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.180
It's also one of the largest
defense contractors in the US.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.884
Tanis worked as an IT engineer.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.809
Says she has files
to back up her claims.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.980
That's the info
she's trading for protection.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.860
Locked away in some
encrypted cloud file only she knows.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.740
That's why we have to keep Tanis off-book,
which is where you come in.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.300
We take her into official custody,
she's in the system.

10:11.400 --> 10:15.020
She's agreed to surrender the files
directly to the attorney general.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.964
So your job is to babysit her
until we can set that up.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.940
- MAN: We'll tag along until her drop.
- Hey.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.660
- Then she's all yours.
- Okay. Done.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.420
- Hey.
- What's the problem now?

10:27.520 --> 10:30.091
You call these guys inconspicuous?
You might as well paint a target on my back.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.620
Hawthorne Global is the best
in private security, Liv.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.700
Yeah? This guy looks like he bought
his suit from Men's Wearhouse.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.740
I'm trusting my life in people...

10:39.840 --> 10:42.100
who can't even protect themselves
from lousy fashion choices?

10:42.200 --> 10:43.900
Look, here's what I want, all right?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.340
You're gonna give me
a burner phone and the AG's number.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.580
In three days, I'll give you a where
and a when. Until then, I'm gone.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.524
That's not gonna happen.
These guys will protect you.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.605
Come on, Liv.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.320
Protect her. Even from herself.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.460
Yep. She's just a ray of sunshine
on a cloudy day.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.164
Yeah, I can see that.

11:38.920 --> 11:42.140
Well, beats chugging up those Afghan
mountain roads in the MRAPs,

11:42.240 --> 11:44.322
- don't you think, Jake?
- Agreed.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.940
- You ever settle down?
- Couldn't find a woman to put up with me yet.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.460
Well, I'm not surprised.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.820
You always were a pain in the ass.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.660
So, how's Susan and the girls?
What are they, four and five now?

11:54.760 --> 11:58.048
- Try seven and eight.
- Where does the time go, huh?

11:58.160 --> 11:59.860
Hopefully they take after their mother.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.042
Oh. Yeah, no, they did, luckily.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.500
- So no one, huh?
- Nope.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.500
What a surprise, with everything
that you clearly have to offer.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.540
Let me guess.
You were a big deal in high school.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.404
What was it?
Quarterback dating a prom queen?

12:10.520 --> 12:13.340
- Running back, actually.
- Of course it was. What was I thinking?

12:13.440 --> 12:16.740
I can see it now. Jakey boy's
gonna go off, win the Heisman,

12:16.840 --> 12:18.700
go pro and become a big, big star.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.900
Oops. Along came this
little thing called the SATs.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.540
That's when you realize not all fairy tales
have happy endings, do they?

12:25.640 --> 12:27.540
Am I wrong?

12:27.640 --> 12:31.340
Fast-forward a couple years, and you're just
another rent-a-cop playing taxi driver.

12:31.440 --> 12:35.420
Not bad, but I hate to break it to you.
SATs weren't really my problem.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.700
Yeah? What was it then? Astonish me.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.371
A little thing called 9/11.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.100
- Permission to speak freely?
- MILLER: By all means.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.300
This is the most entertained
I've been in days.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.460
I think we're both just really impressed to
see you putting together full sentences here.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.940
And I'm just trying
to put together what your story is.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.140
While we're on the subject
of clichés here, I heard your bio.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.700
Ivy League and all.
That means you come from money.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.486
Right? So, what, you're the sweet,
little prep school princess...

13:01.600 --> 13:03.220
that no one really understood?

13:03.320 --> 13:07.940
The type that always got herself into one
fine mess after the other for attention.

13:08.040 --> 13:11.249
Good thing you always had Daddy's
money to count on to bail you out.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.203
At least until now, that is.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.660
Yeah. This time it looks like you
finally found yourself...

13:15.760 --> 13:18.570
in a situation you can't buy
your way out of.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.843
- But what do I know? I'm just a taxi driver.
- That's enough, Carter.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.660
(MILLER SNICKERING)

13:24.760 --> 13:26.842
- You know what?
- Yes, ma'am?

13:26.960 --> 13:28.610
You can kiss...

13:33.280 --> 13:34.566
(GASPS)

13:39.560 --> 13:42.040
- Jesus Christ!
- Reverse!

Back up! Back up!

13:47.560 --> 13:48.925
Stay down!

14:12.000 --> 14:13.923
Bail out! Bail out!

14:22.760 --> 14:24.250
Stay down!

14:29.840 --> 14:33.401
- Numbers?
- I got eight plus in the tree line!

14:55.600 --> 14:57.443
DANIELS: They're moving!

15:01.280 --> 15:03.009
We need to move!

15:12.640 --> 15:13.687
Shit.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.927
They're flanking!
Watch your 3:00 and 9:00!

15:39.480 --> 15:41.164
Oh, shit.

15:49.720 --> 15:53.691
- Johnson. I got the girl coming your way.
- Roger that. We're on it.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.048
Could use a little help here, Dawes.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.730
Go on. Get it done.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.484
They're moving!

16:42.320 --> 16:45.767
I'll draw their fire. Peel around
in the forest and secure the package.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.619
All clear!

17:17.720 --> 17:19.961
Then what are you waiting for?
Get moving!

17:28.920 --> 17:32.129
(PANTING)

17:48.680 --> 17:50.648
I've got her.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.481
JAKE: His keys. Gotta have keys.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.450
Come on.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.845
Come on.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.842
We need to move. Come with me.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.647
Stay behind me.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.849
Come on, okay?

19:00.760 --> 19:02.524
Let's go! Let's go!

19:12.960 --> 19:14.530
Daniels, come in.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.930
I repeat: Do you copy?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.180
Daniels, do you copy? Anyone?

19:22.280 --> 19:23.566
(GUNFIRE)

19:45.560 --> 19:47.210
Get in!

19:50.520 --> 19:52.500
Get down!

19:52.600 --> 19:54.409
- Get down!
- Go!

20:07.800 --> 20:09.768
Jesus!

20:22.560 --> 20:24.700
- Are you hit?
- It's not my blood.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.802
- Jesus Christ! Who were those guys?
- I don't know.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.626
Drop me off somewhere.
I'm better off on my own.

20:28.726 --> 20:32.100
- You wouldn't last five minutes.
- Six weeks in Hong Kong, I was just fine.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.180
Twenty minutes here,
I'm running in a forest getting shot at.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.900
Did you call anyone from a plane?
Boyfriend? A girlfriend?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.620
Seriously? No. No boyfriend
or girlfriend. I'm on my own.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.700
All I have are the clothes
on my back. And now you.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.325
They knew where to hit us.
Someone tipped them off.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.329
- Then let's go to the police.
- No. We can't risk it.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.540
For now, we'll go to the safe house.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.165
With any luck, we got a head start.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.248
- Luck? That's encouraging.
- We'll go to the safe house,

20:51.360 --> 20:53.488
figure out our next move there.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.282
Your boss said you were new. How new?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.300
This is my first day.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.004
Awesome.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.485

22:48.840 --> 22:51.020
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.100
I'll get you some water.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.645
Don't move.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.060
- What are you doing?
- Give me the keys.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.162
Bad idea. Out there on your own,
you're too exposed.

22:59.280 --> 23:02.900
- No, I'm going to the cops.
- Whoever ambushed us will have that covered.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.300
I appreciate you saving my life,
but I don't know you.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.500
I don't know anyone. In fact,
you guys have a rat in your company,

23:08.600 --> 23:12.500
which means there's really
only one person that I can trust... me.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.700
Give me the damn car keys.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.290
I can't do that.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.449
You think I won't blow
your head off right here?

23:22.240 --> 23:23.700
Maybe.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.100
My job is to protect you.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.168
I give you the keys,
I'm not doing my job.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.003
You ever hear the term semper fi?

23:34.960 --> 23:36.860
"Always faithful"?

23:36.960 --> 23:40.300
So what, you're a marine?
Is that supposed to put my mind at ease?

23:40.400 --> 23:42.860
Yeah, it should. But I don't
give a shit if it does or not.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.726
We don't have time for this. So either
shoot me or let me do my damn job.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.447
I won't let them get to you.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.004
So you trust me now?

24:15.280 --> 24:18.660
This is our boy. Jake Carter.

24:18.760 --> 24:22.048
Force recon marine. Just back from
Afghanistan. Been here a few weeks.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.088
He still has war in his blood.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.580
But he's alone. No chain of command.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.011
He'll follow the plan.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.881
(BEEPING)

25:19.280 --> 25:21.460

- You okay in there?

25:21.560 --> 25:23.130
Yeah. Just one sec, please.

25:25.880 --> 25:28.420
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah. I said give me a sec, all right?

25:28.520 --> 25:30.568
Sorry. It's just...

25:30.680 --> 25:32.762
We gotta get moving.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.608
Is there anything to eat? I'm starved.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.340
Eat up.

25:54.440 --> 25:56.540
Yeah, that's not food.
I'm not eating that.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.140
Is there anything organic?

25:58.240 --> 26:01.580
Organic? There you go.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.444
Get your stuff. We're leaving.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.611
Get back in one of the rooms.
Don't come out unless I say so.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.883
If anything happens,
get out of here and don't look back.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.370
(BEEPING)

26:42.880 --> 26:44.644
Drop it.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.500
Jake.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.126
I said drop it now.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.970
Now!

26:56.240 --> 26:58.180
Jake.

26:58.280 --> 27:01.540
- Jake, what the hell is this?
- That's what I wanna know.

27:01.640 --> 27:04.405
- Didn't think anyone made it out.
- No one else did.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.580
Except you two.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.980
After you and Tanis broke free, we found
an opportunity to get away, and we took it.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.340
Yeah, we saw you drive away
with the girl. Good man.

27:14.440 --> 27:16.060
Where'd you get the car?

27:16.160 --> 27:18.820
We borrowed it from a very patriotic
redneck we stumbled across.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.260
Look, Jake, I get it.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.283
You don't know who to trust.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.260
- Exactly.
- Okay.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.780
But if I was dirty, I wouldn't
come back here with just one more gun.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.769
I'd hit you hard.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.900
I know who these guys are, okay?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.809
Jake, it's me.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.889
Can I put my hands down, please?

27:42.080 --> 27:43.684
All right.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.300
- Who are they?
- His name is Simon Vogel.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.620
Former South African Special Forces.

27:52.720 --> 27:56.180
We used to use him for odd jobs
when we couldn't afford the visibility.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.820
Then he went... became unstable.

27:57.920 --> 28:01.180
There was a job in Beirut. Things got
real messy, and we had to cut him loose.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.805
I didn't even know he was still alive.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.770
- His team?
- If it's the same crew he used to run with,

28:05.880 --> 28:08.963
they're all former tier-one operators...
best money can buy.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.420
How did he know our route?

28:12.520 --> 28:16.260
Just like you suspect.
Someone tipped him off from the inside.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.408
- Exactly.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.610
- And the sidearm.
- (PANTING)

28:36.440 --> 28:38.169
Hey.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.020
Where is she?

28:43.120 --> 28:44.849
Not here.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.485
Bullshit.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.924
Move.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.805
Keep moving.

29:12.640 --> 29:15.644
Stand right there like a good boy.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.322
I figured whoever was dirty
was gonna show up here.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.170
So I stashed her.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.129
Oh, is that so?

29:53.760 --> 29:55.842
Move.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.930
Into the kitchen.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.125
Back there.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.091
Satisfied?

30:18.600 --> 30:22.525
Okay. I'll play. What do you want?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.889
I don't negotiate against myself.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.245
Give me a number.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.049
You'd sell her out?

30:33.720 --> 30:35.324
Just like that?

30:36.960 --> 30:40.442
So I'll ask you again. What's she worth?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.860
Here's your number.

30:43.960 --> 30:46.440
Five, four,

30:46.560 --> 30:49.940
- three, two...
- Go on. Call my bluff, bitch.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.281
Meantime, I'm gonna have breakfast.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.540

33:22.640 --> 33:25.689
I didn't have eyes on the girl.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.820
This should have been easy.
You had the element of surprise.

33:31.920 --> 33:37.324
Maybe if you did your job and killed Tanis
at the ambush, we wouldn't be in this mess.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.725
Let's go.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.609
You okay?

34:06.760 --> 34:09.081
- Liv, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

34:09.199 --> 34:12.500
Good. Should be a road up ahead,
probably less than a mile away.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.090
Should be. Oh, great. Then what?

34:14.199 --> 34:17.219
- I'm working on the "then what."
- Of course you are.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.659
You know what would be really nice?
If you were just certain of something here.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.500
Okay. Here's what I'm certain of.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.728
The research they put
into making you disappear...

34:24.840 --> 34:26.780
is an all-or-nothing type of move.

34:26.880 --> 34:30.407
They don't send this much heat
unless what you have on these guys is legit.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.300
I'm also certain that...

34:34.400 --> 34:36.562
they're not gonna stop
until you're dead.

34:37.639 --> 34:39.179
I can bury them all.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.248
What the hell you have on them?

34:44.360 --> 34:45.940
You remember a couple of years back...

34:46.040 --> 34:48.900
a bunch of troops in Afghanistan died
due to faulty body armor?

34:49.000 --> 34:52.739
Remember? I was there.
Witnessed it firsthand.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.300
You're saying that Genesis Defense
Corporation was behind that?

34:55.400 --> 34:56.969
That's just the beginning.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.340
That makes this all the more worth it.

- Come on. We gotta keep moving.
- Carter.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.570
You know I heard everything you said
back there about selling me out.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.700
- Come on, Liv. I was lying to buy time.
- Maybe.

35:12.800 --> 35:16.820
Or maybe you're just keeping me alive
till a better offer comes along.

35:16.920 --> 35:20.561

to save your life before you trust me?

they're the ones that are after me.

Hey, Officer. I'm looking for a girl.
Brown hair, blue eyes, pretty.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.500
Did she come in here,
maybe talking about being in trouble?

39:07.600 --> 39:09.220
How about you just calm down?

- She's in here, isn't she?

- Where is she? I need to talk to her.
- No, what you're gonna do...

39:17.040 --> 39:18.940
is you're gonna wait here.

you can't identify any of these men?

No, I can't identify...
I've never seen these guys in my life...

39:38.320 --> 39:40.243
They were shooting at me.
What was I supposed to do?

39:40.360 --> 39:41.930

- Okay, relax. Hey, relax!

43:47.360 --> 43:50.011
- (GUNFIRE)
- Let's go.

43:57.680 --> 43:59.682
I do things my way.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.003
Carter!

44:47.640 --> 44:50.723
Stay on my hip. Come on. Come on.

45:33.520 --> 45:36.180
Run. Go to ground somewhere.
Hide. Anything.

45:36.280 --> 45:39.620
Contact the attorney general's
office directly. No one else. Got it?

45:39.720 --> 45:41.882
- Go.
- Wha... No...

45:42.600 --> 45:45.126
(GUNFIRE)

45:47.360 --> 45:50.489
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

46:40.040 --> 46:42.247
Get your wounded. I'll cover you. Go.

46:51.240 --> 46:53.049
- Let's go! Move it!
- Get out the back.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.844
- (GUNFIRE)
- Come on.

46:56.640 --> 46:59.371
Move it! Move it! Let's go! Come on!

47:03.680 --> 47:05.409
That's Carter.

47:07.880 --> 47:09.882
So much for doing things your way.

47:11.080 --> 47:12.844
Perimeter? Check 6:00.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.489
Dawes. Bring it.

47:45.200 --> 47:49.100
Jake Carter! My name's Simon Vogel!

47:49.200 --> 47:51.100
It's nice to meet you.

47:51.200 --> 47:53.060
I can't say the same.

47:53.160 --> 47:55.980
I have to admit, I respect your skills.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.820
But you died the moment
you put that suit on.

47:58.920 --> 48:01.924
- Where's Olivia Tanis, Carter?
- Why don't you come take a look?

48:02.920 --> 48:04.420
Oh, yeah, that's cute.

48:04.520 --> 48:06.966
Only if you promise
not to run away this time.

48:07.080 --> 48:08.660
Examine your situation.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.740
You're pinned down and outgunned.

48:10.840 --> 48:14.260
Tell us where she is, Carter,
and you can walk away from this.

48:14.360 --> 48:16.620
You got maybe 10 minutes.
Backup's on the way.

48:16.720 --> 48:18.609
You should think about your next move.

48:19.600 --> 48:23.650
I just murdered a whole police station.
What's a few more?

48:25.880 --> 48:28.580
Be smart, Carter. Give us the girl.

48:28.680 --> 48:31.540
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We don't know if she's with Carter.

48:31.640 --> 48:34.371
You're either in front of the gun
or behind it.

48:34.480 --> 48:36.608
- You choose.
- (WEAPON COCKS)

48:57.560 --> 48:59.688
- (GUNSHOTS)
- (GROANING)

49:11.720 --> 49:12.801
Get in!

49:16.280 --> 49:18.567
Go, go, go, go!

49:31.760 --> 49:33.205
Let's go! Let's go!

49:34.360 --> 49:35.850
Go!

49:41.600 --> 49:45.366
- So now what are we gonna do?
- Drive! Just drive!

49:47.040 --> 49:49.281
Shit. Shit.

49:52.920 --> 49:54.729
Get off the main road!

50:01.400 --> 50:04.060
Here they come!
Move! Let's go! Move it!

50:04.160 --> 50:05.685
Shit.

50:10.320 --> 50:13.130
Run him down! Faster!

50:22.680 --> 50:25.684
- Faster! Move it!
- Are you crazy? I can't...

50:55.680 --> 50:56.761
Faster!

51:34.040 --> 51:36.780
Jesus Christ! I want this guy!

51:36.880 --> 51:38.689
- Faster!
- Christ!

52:17.880 --> 52:20.087
- You're losing him.
- Come on, Grant!

53:22.400 --> 53:24.607
(GRUNTS, GROANS)

53:27.880 --> 53:29.291
Are you okay?

53:33.000 --> 53:35.082
- (GUNFIRE CONTINUES)
- Move! Just go!

54:07.880 --> 54:09.405
(GRUNTS)

54:16.680 --> 54:18.489
Let's go. Time to clean it up.

54:34.160 --> 54:38.802
(ENGINE RATTLING)

54:50.960 --> 54:54.123
Here, take that. Take it.

54:59.440 --> 55:01.568
We gotta move. We gotta move. Let's go.

55:30.360 --> 55:31.860
Grab your gear.

55:31.960 --> 55:33.900
They've gone to ground.
We'll hunt them on foot.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.900
Wait. Are you sure
that's the wisest move?

55:37.000 --> 55:38.660
Carter's just turned the tables
in his favor.

55:38.760 --> 55:41.764
He knows what he's doing.
That's why he went into the woods.

55:44.400 --> 55:46.420
What options do we have, huh?

55:46.520 --> 55:48.460
If you have any ideas, I'm all ears.

55:48.560 --> 55:51.140
Hey, listen. We are dwindling numbers,
in case you haven't noticed.

55:51.240 --> 55:55.300
We've got to regroup,
call in more muscle and go in at sunrise.

55:55.400 --> 55:57.980
They are on foot
and will be blind when it gets dark.

55:58.080 --> 56:00.420
They're not gonna get far.

56:00.520 --> 56:02.602
You'll wanna lose this.

56:02.720 --> 56:07.282
Hayes. Call Marcus. We're going
in first thing in the morning.

56:34.520 --> 56:36.568
No, no. Let me help you.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.180
(GROANS)

56:47.280 --> 56:49.248
Sorry. I'm not a nurse.

56:50.440 --> 56:52.920
- Told you to run back there.
- (EXHALES)

56:54.480 --> 56:57.484
Something you should know
about me by now. I don't listen too well.

56:58.720 --> 57:00.722
Can you pass me one of the clips?

57:12.320 --> 57:15.688
- Thanks.
- You would have done the same.

57:25.600 --> 57:29.605
Hey. I found this.
See if you can get a signal on it.

57:31.720 --> 57:32.900
- (SNIFFLES)
- (BEEPING)

57:33.000 --> 57:35.480
No, there's no signal,
but I'll keep trying.

57:41.960 --> 57:44.804
I should have trusted you. I should
have just trusted you from the start.

57:44.920 --> 57:47.127
- Hey.
- I walked into that police station.

57:47.240 --> 57:48.924
- Don't.
- They're dead.

57:49.040 --> 57:50.540
- That's on me.
- No.

57:50.640 --> 57:53.380
It's on the people who sent
those bastards after you.

57:53.480 --> 57:55.164
None of this is your fault.

58:02.520 --> 58:03.681
Hey.

58:08.960 --> 58:11.180
What are you doing?

58:11.280 --> 58:14.284
This is an encrypted Web address
with my password.

58:15.880 --> 58:17.980
It's everything that I know on Genesis.

58:18.080 --> 58:20.082
It implicates
half the board of directors.

58:24.560 --> 58:26.562
You're the only one that I've told.

58:28.360 --> 58:30.860
You know,

58:30.960 --> 58:32.485
just in case.

58:33.960 --> 58:36.406
We're gonna be fine.

58:40.800 --> 58:44.566
When this is over,
you're gonna get to watch them all burn.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.611
(EXHALES)

59:03.920 --> 59:05.380
So what now?

59:05.480 --> 59:08.740
We keep moving until we get
a signal on that phone.

59:08.840 --> 59:11.460
Our only play is contacting
the attorney general directly somehow.

59:11.560 --> 59:13.300
How the hell do we do that?

59:13.400 --> 59:14.970
I haven't figured that part out yet.

59:15.080 --> 59:17.811
So what, we're just supposed
to die out here in the woods?

59:18.640 --> 59:20.165
Did I say that?

59:21.920 --> 59:23.809
We stop running.

59:26.960 --> 59:30.487
Come on. Let's keep going.
We'll find a signal.

59:39.720 --> 59:43.140
(BEEPING)

59:43.240 --> 59:44.860
Still nothing.

59:44.960 --> 59:46.849
(BEEPING CONTINUES)

59:46.960 --> 59:48.500
- (SIGHS)
- Okay.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.700
So we've got the river in front of us
and the ridgeline all around us.

59:51.800 --> 59:55.700
There's... five hours till sunrise.
That's when they're gonna come for us.

59:55.800 --> 59:58.140
But then we're trapped,
and they know exactly where to find us.

59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.767
That's what I'm hoping for. Come on.
We got a lot of work to do.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.620
All right, Liv.
This is where we part ways.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.563
Head that way towards the river
and follow it.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.020
- Eventually you'll hit a road.
- No way. I'm safer with you.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.841
- I don't wanna argue with you.
- Good. Then don't. Let's go.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.722
Got more blood here.
They definitely came this way.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.090
Dawes, you got anything?

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.940
Cops got nothing so far.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.690
The whole area is still locked down.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.860
Roadblocks, checkpoints, everything.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.564
Everyone take a deep breath.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.246
Let's take our time. Do this right.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.220
(BUZZING)

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.980
- Is that Genesis?
- Yep.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.605
What do they want?

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.962
For you to do your job.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.442
Hayes, pick up the pace.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.165
Hayes, which way?

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.770
Hayes.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.340
Hayes.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:23.020
I lost it.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.645
Trail's gone.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.650
Find it.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.500
It's him. Channel two.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:30.860
(STATIC)

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.928
JAKE:
Vogel. Simon Vogel. Are you there?

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.088
- (WHISPERING) Can you track him?
- Yeah.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.940
Carter. It's good to hear your voice.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.140
Did you miss me?

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.180
Very much.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.841
To think we were just
getting to know each other.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.580
- Is the girl with you?
- Here's the thing, Simon.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.460
She's not your problem anymore. I am.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.260
I've noticed.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.681
If I were you, I'd actually keep
an eye on Smith.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.963
He's the sort that likes to shoot people
in the head when they're not looking.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.100
Listen, Jake. We both know you're not
gonna make it out of this canyon.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.363
- (BEEPING)
- So let's be frank with each other.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.780
It's just a matter
of what the attrition rate will be.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.260
Oh, you're good. I'll give you that.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.180
And, ironically, you've opened up new
opportunities for recruitment on my team.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.420
You're offering me a job?

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.100
Bring me the girl.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.580
You get to live and get rich.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.180
What do you say?

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.260
Thanks, but no, thanks.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.380
It's not why I called.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.260
Why did you call?

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.964
(GUNSHOT)

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.980
With me! Circle around! Cut him off!

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.605
Go, go, go!

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.805
Spread out!

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.446
Don't lose her.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.361
Go!

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.164
I've got Tanis.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.170
(BONES CRACK)

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.250
Blake's down.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.409
Hayes, do you have anything?

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.642
Any sign of them at all?

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.687
Nothing.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.204
(GROANS)

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.211
(GROANING)

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.245
I can't find Marcus.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.300
- Are you ready?
- Of course not.

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:14.926
Hug the shadows. Only move
when you have to. Hit and run. Got it?

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.460
Yeah.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.243
VOGEL: Where are they?

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.724
Are you kidding me?

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.444
They slipped past all of you.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:38.046
VOGEL: Shut your mouth!
Or I'll shut it for you!

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.899
Gotta hold it together. We'll find them.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.540
What if that's what he wants?
I told you, Carter's not stupid.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.564
He is sucking us in
so he can pick us off one by one.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.444
Duck!

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.260
- Forget him. Let's move on.
- SMITH: Hey.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:15.728
What makes you think Carter doesn't
have the rest of this valley rigged?

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.649
He's one man.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.565
(CLICKS TONGUE)

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.446
Yeah, well, that logic seems to have
worked out well for you so far, hmm?

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.682
Go that way! I'll draw them away!

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.441

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.088
Holy shit.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.241
HAYES: Vogel. Vogel, you copy?

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.810
Ramirez is down.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.980
So, what's the plan, Vogel?

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.924
Or are you just gonna let us all die
while you figure it out?

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.810
You wanna lead?

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.731
Yeah.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.180
VOGEL: Dawes. I'm driving them your way

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.566
Yeah.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.740
Move.

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.365
Hayes, over here!

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.049
Where's the girl?

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.521
(YELLS, GRUNTS)

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.620
Whoo! Oorah!

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.370
Not bad, marine.

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.460
That's not bad.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.244
Not bad at all.

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.082
But you just don't get
the girl this time.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.530
What a shame.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.780
You know,

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.820
I don't always like to shoot people
in the back of the head...

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.888
when they're not looking.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.086
Sometimes I want them to see it coming.

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.967
Put your gun down.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.290
I said put it down.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.060
- Where's Vogel?
- I don't know.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.004
- (GUNSHOT)
- Jake! Oh!

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.408
Get up.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.100
Come on, princess.

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.009
Now.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.088
We're going for a little walk.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.451
Now!

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.563
Keep moving.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.460
What makes you think
that when I'm dead you're not next?

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.609
Genesis has a way
of tying up loose ends.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.100
That's why you're gonna
give me all the dirt you have on them.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.885
That information is my insurance policy.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.726
Move.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.460
You're too late.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:34.168
I just forwarded everything that I have
on Genesis to a dozen news sites.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.806
You're gonna have to kill me.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.282
- You little bitch.
- JAKE: Vogel!

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.605
(BONES CRACK)

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.487
(JAKE COUGHING)

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:23.161
I got you. I got you.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.460
MAN: On our broadcast tonight...

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.300
MAN 2: A national disgrace.
A stunning revelation...

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.140
MAN 3:
...the testing of bulletproof plating...

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.140
MAN 4: ...no idea of the extent
of the illegal activity...

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:57.900
WOMAN: Police are continuing
their investigations into the...

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.900
MAN 5: ...and other soldiers
have been involved in...

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.820
WOMAN 2: ...endangers the lives
of American troops.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.500
MAN 6:
...breaking another story tonight...

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.860
WOMAN 3: Several board members
of Genesis Defense Corporation...

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.380
MAN 7: Genesis Defense Corporation's
stock plummeted today...

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.482
MAN 8: ...has cooperated
with the federal government,

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.980
and her name is listed in an action...

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.050
MAN 9: The Department of Justice
will review the criminal...

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.122
Wow, Carter. You look like hell.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.380
Good to see you too. How you doing?

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.380
Well, seeing as how in the last three days
six members of Genesis Defense Corporation...

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:06.860
are now being indicted
for treason and conspiracy,

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.769
pretty damn good.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.780
- So, what's next? What's the plan?
- (SIGHS)

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.540
I don't know. New identity, new life.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.580
They won't tell me where I'm going.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.604
Probably Boise or some god-awful town
with a population of 100.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.900
- Small towns aren't so bad.
- Yeah.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.685
I'm sure you'll do great
wherever you land.

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.210
I got you something.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:36.970
Seeing as I made you ruin your last one.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.380
- There you go.
- Thanks.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.528
No, no. Thank you.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.484
See you later, marine.
