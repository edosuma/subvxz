WEBVTT

00:04.800 --> 00:07.467
- OH, GOD, I'M EXHAUSTED.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.400
[groans]

00:08.433 --> 00:09.600
I COULD FALL ASLEEP
RIGHT HERE.

00:09.633 --> 00:13.067
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
I GET IT.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.500
- GET WHAT?

00:21.533 --> 00:25.133
- YOU DON'T GOT TO DO
THE WHOLE "I'M TIRED" SHOW.

00:27.767 --> 00:28.767
DON'T WORRY.

00:28.800 --> 00:33.100
I WILL NOT BE...BOTHERING YOU
THIS EVENING.

00:34.567 --> 00:35.633
- WAIT A MINUTE.

00:35.667 --> 00:36.567
YOU THINK THIS IS AN ACT

00:36.600 --> 00:39.200
SO I WON'T HAVE TO HAVE SEX
WITH YOU?

00:39.233 --> 00:41.267
- NOT MUCH OF AN ACT.

00:44.333 --> 00:47.667
YOU COULD JAZZ IT UP
WITH A SONG OR TWO.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.000
AND--AND BY THE WAY,

00:49.033 --> 00:52.633
I WASN'T GONNA DO ANYTHING LATER
ANYWAY, OKAY, SO...

00:52.667 --> 00:57.567
YOU DON'T GOT TO INSULT ME
WITH YOUR PREEMPTIVE STRIKE.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.767
- YOU'RE NUTS.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.733
- ADMIT IT.

00:59.767 --> 01:02.467
YOU CAME IN HERE
TO TELL ME YOU WERE TIRED

01:02.500 --> 01:03.900
SO I WOULD
LEAVE YOU ALONE LATER.

01:03.933 --> 01:04.900
- I DID NOT!

01:04.933 --> 01:05.900
- WHY CAN'T YOU ADMIT IT?

01:05.933 --> 01:07.233
- [sighs]

01:07.267 --> 01:09.267
- LOOK, YOU'RE TIRED, RIGHT?
YOU HAD A LONG DAY.

01:09.300 --> 01:13.533
SO WHAT'S THE LAST THING
YOU WOULD WANT TO DO LATER?

01:13.567 --> 01:16.000
- WELL, YOU MIGHT
BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

01:16.033 --> 01:18.333
- HUH. SEE?
I KNOW.

01:18.367 --> 01:21.333
I KNOW WHEN PEOPLE
DON'T WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH ME.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.300
YOU'RE TALKIN' TO AN EXPERT.

01:26.333 --> 01:29.333
- OKAY, SO LET ME
ASK YOU THIS...

01:29.367 --> 01:30.600
HOW COME YOU'RE ONLY PICKING UP

01:30.633 --> 01:32.433
THAT "I'M TIRED" MEANS
"NO SEX TONIGHT"?

01:32.467 --> 01:34.067
HOW COME "I'M TIRED"
DOESN'T ALSO MEAN

01:34.100 --> 01:36.000
"GEE, I COULD REALLY USE
SOME HELP IN THE KITCHEN

01:36.033 --> 01:37.833
WITH ALL THOSE DISHES"?

01:37.867 --> 01:41.100
- WHAT AM I,
A MIND READER?

01:42.867 --> 01:48.700
announcer: ANOTHER SEASON OF
"EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND."

01:48.733 --> 01:51.667
[grunting]

01:55.033 --> 01:58.167
[triumphant instrumental music]

02:00.667 --> 02:02.200
[laughter]

02:20.633 --> 02:21.700
- HEY.

02:21.733 --> 02:25.000
- HI.

02:25.033 --> 02:26.400
- HOW'S YOUR BOOK?

02:26.433 --> 02:28.600
- IT'S REALLY GREAT.

02:28.633 --> 02:29.667
- YEAH?

02:29.700 --> 02:31.433
- YEAH, IT TAKES PLACE
IN THE 19TH CENTURY--

02:31.467 --> 02:34.067
- THAT'S VERY INTERESTING.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.133
- RAY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:36.167 --> 02:38.167
- WHAT?
YOU'RE UP.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.633
- SO WHAT?

02:40.667 --> 02:41.600
- SO I-I COME IN HERE,

02:41.633 --> 02:43.133
YOU'RE UP;
YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.367
YOU'RE NOT TOO TIRED.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.800
- WHO SAYS I'M NOT TOO TIRED?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.500
ALL I'M DOING IS READING.

02:47.533 --> 02:48.767
- SO YOU CAN
STAY UP TO READ,

02:48.800 --> 02:51.267
BUT YOU CAN'T SPARE
TWO MINUTES FOR SEX?

02:53.567 --> 02:56.167
- LOOK, I'M SORRY, RAY, OKAY?

02:56.200 --> 02:57.967
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M TRYING TO TRICK YOU.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.900
I AM TIRED,

02:59.933 --> 03:01.600
AND I THOUGHT I WOULD DO
A LITTLE READING

03:01.633 --> 03:04.933
BEFORE I FELL ASLEEP.

03:04.967 --> 03:07.533
- ALL RIGHT.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.300
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
WE COULD DO A LITTLE

03:09.333 --> 03:11.433
BEFORE WE BOTH FALL ASLEEP.

03:11.467 --> 03:14.833
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT TALKIN' ABOUT
RUNNIN' A MARATHON HERE.

03:14.867 --> 03:17.133
WE'RE JUST GOING TO
ROLL AROUND A LITTLE, YOU KNOW?

03:17.167 --> 03:20.000
I FIND IT VERY RELAXING
AND RESTFUL,

03:20.033 --> 03:23.800
BUT WHAT THE HELL
DO I KNOW?

03:23.833 --> 03:25.100
[sighs]
YOU GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD--

03:25.133 --> 03:26.600
- RAY, COME ON.

03:30.367 --> 03:31.733
- IF A BOOK
ABOUT THE 19TH CENTURY

03:31.767 --> 03:36.133
DOESN'T PUT YOU TO SLEEP,
HOW TIRED CAN YOU BE?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.567
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT
YOU WOULD RATHER READ?

03:44.600 --> 03:47.333
- TONIGHT, YES.

03:49.833 --> 03:52.833
- DO ME A FAVOR, IF THERE'S
PEOPLE HAVING SEX IN THAT BOOK,

03:52.867 --> 03:55.400
COULD YOU READ OUT LOUD?

04:02.900 --> 04:05.467
- HERE, ONE OF YOU TRY THIS.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.067
- OH, GOD!

04:11.100 --> 04:13.000
THIS IS AWFUL!

04:20.567 --> 04:25.600
- I THOUGHT SO.
IT'S DEBRA'S.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.600
IT'S GONE BAD.

04:26.633 --> 04:27.433
ALTHOUGH, WITH DEBRA,

04:27.467 --> 04:29.967
IT PROBABLY DIDN'T
HAVE FAR TO GO.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.100
- WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME SEE THAT.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.567
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

04:53.033 --> 04:57.600
THE UNDERPART'S
A LITTLE BETTER.

04:57.633 --> 04:59.100
- WHAT IS IT?

04:59.133 --> 05:00.733
- I DON'T KNOW.

05:00.767 --> 05:01.833
IT'S GOT A CRUNCH,

05:01.867 --> 05:06.100
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT'S ON PURPOSE.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.233
- OH, HELLO, RAYMOND.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.000
- MA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:13.033 --> 05:14.367
- I'M CLEANING YOUR FRIDGE.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.200
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ONE ITEM,
BUT ONCE I OPENED IT...

05:17.233 --> 05:20.533
WELL, DEAR,
IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS.

05:20.567 --> 05:23.000
- MA, YOU--YOU PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS.

05:23.033 --> 05:26.233
OH.
ALL RIGHT, DO IT TO THAT.

05:26.267 --> 05:29.267
JUST HURRY UP
BEFORE SHE GETS BACK.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.033
- WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

05:34.733 --> 05:36.600
- YOU FINISHED THAT?

05:36.633 --> 05:39.700
- YEP.

05:39.733 --> 05:42.500
- AND NOW WE WAIT.

05:46.867 --> 05:48.300
- WHAT DID YOU BUY, RAYMOND?

05:48.333 --> 05:50.033
- OH, UH...NO, IT'S NOTHING.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.633
- OH, SOMETHING SENSITIVE.

05:51.667 --> 05:52.933
- WHAT IS IT?

05:52.967 --> 05:55.067
- NO, IT'S JUST SHIRTS.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.767
- YOU BOUGHT SHIRTS?

05:56.800 --> 05:58.367
BY YOURSELF?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.867
- YES.

05:59.900 --> 06:03.333
- LET'S SEE THESE...SHIRTS.

06:03.367 --> 06:06.900
- I WOULD NOT BE COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT, ALL RIGHT?

06:06.933 --> 06:08.233
- WHY THE HELL NOT?

06:08.267 --> 06:10.033
- BECAUSE, THEY'RE...

06:10.067 --> 06:12.000
UNDERSHIRTS.

06:12.033 --> 06:13.300
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO HIDE SOMETHING?

06:13.333 --> 06:16.733
- MIND YOUR BUSINESS, MA.
ALL RIGHT?

06:16.767 --> 06:19.767
- SENSUOPOLY.

06:26.433 --> 06:28.833
THE BOARD GAME
OF LOVE AND INTIMACY.

06:28.867 --> 06:32.033
- IT'S A GAG GIFT THAT I GOT
FOR A FRIEND OF MINE

06:32.067 --> 06:36.967
WHO...LOVES GAGS.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.333
- OH, REALLY?

06:38.367 --> 06:43.033
AND WHO IS THIS LOVER OF GAGS?

06:43.067 --> 06:45.400
WOULD HIS NAME
START WITH AN "R"

06:45.433 --> 06:50.133
AND END
WITH AN "AYMOND," HMM?

06:50.167 --> 06:51.500
- GIVE ME THE GAME.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.700
- I'VE HEARD OF THESE GAMES.
THEY'RE FOR ADULTS ONLY.

06:53.733 --> 06:55.467
- OH, MY GOD.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.900
- GONNA SPICE THINGS UP,
EH, RACY?

06:58.933 --> 07:00.167
- DAD, NO. IT'S JUST--

07:00.200 --> 07:03.767
- OH, RAYMOND.
ANOTHER SEX GAME?

07:03.800 --> 07:05.133
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:05.167 --> 07:07.733
- WELL, IT'S LIKE THE OTHER ONE
YOU HAD WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER

07:07.767 --> 07:09.667
WITH ALL THE COLORED DOTS.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.567
- TWISTER?

07:13.200 --> 07:17.167
- DON'T THINK I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON DOWNSTAIRS.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.700
- WHAT?
I PLAYED WITH ROBERT.

07:20.733 --> 07:24.600
- I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANY MORE.

07:24.633 --> 07:27.100
- THIS GAME
MUST BE DEBRA'S DOING.

07:27.133 --> 07:28.200
- WELL, IT'S NOT.

07:28.233 --> 07:30.200
- I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED
WHEN I OPENED THE FRIDGE

07:30.233 --> 07:33.033
WITH TWO BOTTLES
OF WHITE WINE?

07:33.067 --> 07:36.067
ARE YOU SWINGERS?

07:36.100 --> 07:37.200
- ALL RIGHT, MA.

07:37.233 --> 07:40.367
YOU JUST ASKED
IF I WAS A WIFE-SWAPPER.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.967
- NOW, THERE'S AN IDEA.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.267
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SWAP.

07:45.300 --> 07:48.333
I'LL JUST MAKE A DONATION.

07:53.433 --> 07:55.000
- I SURE HOPE
YOU'RE BETTER AT THIS

07:55.033 --> 07:58.367
THAN YOU WERE AT TWISTER.

07:58.400 --> 08:03.433
AS I REMEMBER,
YOU HAD NO FLEXIBILITY AT ALL.

08:03.467 --> 08:06.000
POOR DEBRA.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.700
- NO, YOU SHOULD CLOSE
YOUR CURTAINS TOO.

08:10.733 --> 08:12.967
YOU NEVER KNOW WHO'S
LOOKING INTO THE WINDOWS.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.400
- I GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

08:16.867 --> 08:17.833
- HEY.

08:17.867 --> 08:18.833
- HEY.
- WHAT'S UP?

08:18.867 --> 08:19.967
- MOM!

08:20.000 --> 08:23.767
- WHATEVER YOU DO IN YOUR
BEDROOM IS YOUR BUSINESS.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.700
- SENSUOPOLY?

08:25.733 --> 08:29.100
- IT'S NOT FROM ME.
IT'S FROM HIM.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.967
- RAY,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:34.033 --> 08:36.300
FOR ONCE I'D LIKE TO BRING
A GAME INTO THIS HOUSE

08:36.333 --> 08:39.333
WITHOUT BEING ACCUSED
OF HAVING SEX WITH MY BROTHER.

08:44.267 --> 08:45.633
- LISTEN, SWEETHEART...

08:45.667 --> 08:47.967
EVERYBODY'S MAKING A BIG FUSS
OVER NOTHING.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.400
NOW, I LOOKED
AT THE BACK OF THE BOX,

08:49.433 --> 08:52.600
AND FROM WHAT
I COULD SEE...

08:57.667 --> 09:00.333
TO BE CONTINUED.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.600
- OKAY, KIDS ARE DOWN.

09:16.633 --> 09:18.600
- YEAH.
LISTEN...

09:18.633 --> 09:22.733
SORRY ABOUT THE EMBARRASSMENT
TODAY WITH THE GAME AND ALL.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.733
YOU KNOW, I JUST--
I WENT TO THE STORE TO TRY

09:24.767 --> 09:26.900
TO BUY YOU A FUNNY CARD.
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE OF LAST NIGHT.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.733
BUT THEY'RE NOT FUNNY.
THEY'RE JUST STUPID.

09:29.767 --> 09:33.233
THERE'S ONE FUNNY ONE--
THE OLD GUY WITH NO TEETH...

09:33.267 --> 09:34.500
[muffled]
LIKE THIS...

09:34.533 --> 09:35.933
BUT, YEAH,
I COULDN'T REMEMBER

09:35.967 --> 09:39.133
IF I GOT YOU THAT
FOR VALENTINE'S DAY OR NOT SO...

09:39.167 --> 09:40.933
YOU KNOW, SO I JUST--

09:40.967 --> 09:43.667
I GOT YOU THAT GAME
JUST TO SAY,

09:43.700 --> 09:46.867
YOU KNOW, "HA HA."

09:46.900 --> 09:48.033
- IT'S OKAY, RAY.

09:48.067 --> 09:50.800
COME ON, LET'S GO PLAY.

09:50.833 --> 09:52.867
- WHAT?

09:52.900 --> 09:54.300
WHAT?

10:11.067 --> 10:12.367
YOU REALLY WANT TO PLAY THIS?

10:12.400 --> 10:15.167
EVEN THOUGH MY MOTHER
KNOWS WE HAVE IT?

10:15.200 --> 10:16.167
- WE'VE ALREADY GOT THE GUILT.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.900
WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE THE FUN.

10:17.933 --> 10:20.400
- WELL, ALL RIIIGHT!

10:21.967 --> 10:24.267
- OKAY. HERE'S THE DIRECTIONS.
I'VE ALREADY READ THEM.

10:24.300 --> 10:27.167
- HEY, I DON'T NEED DIRECTIONS.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.467
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A WHILE,
BUT I REMEMBER.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.967
- OKAY, SO IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.333
YOU JUST ROLL THE DICE,

10:34.367 --> 10:36.900
AND YOU DO WHATEVER IT SAYS
ON THE SQUARE YOU LAND ON.

10:36.933 --> 10:38.100
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT?

10:38.133 --> 10:39.767
NOW, SOME OF THE SQUARES
ARE NAUGHTY...

10:39.800 --> 10:42.467
- HANG ON.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.200
GO AHEAD.

10:47.233 --> 10:48.433
- AND SOME ARE ROMANTIC.

10:48.467 --> 10:49.767
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.800
- OKAY, SO I'LL GO FIRST.

10:51.833 --> 10:53.500
THIS IS ME. THAT'S YOU.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.667
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON, BUDDY,
PUT YOUR GAME FACE ON.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.100
OOH, OOH...

10:57.133 --> 10:59.000
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

10:59.033 --> 11:01.200
STOP, STOP, STOP.
OKAY, READY?

11:01.233 --> 11:02.833
- OOH, LUCKY NUMBER SEVEN.

11:02.867 --> 11:08.167
- OKAY, ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.433
"KISS YOUR LOVER

11:10.467 --> 11:13.500
AS THOUGH THEY ARE
ABOUT TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST."

11:13.533 --> 11:15.933
- OH, YEAH.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.233
- OKAY.

11:29.267 --> 11:31.067
RAY! RAY, RAY, STOP IT!

11:31.100 --> 11:32.967
RAY!

11:33.000 --> 11:34.333
IT'S YOUR TURN.

11:34.367 --> 11:35.633
- I LOVE THIS GAME.

11:35.667 --> 11:36.800
- RAY, COME ON!
RAY!

11:36.833 --> 11:38.367
YOU'VE GOT TO ROLL!

11:38.400 --> 11:39.867
- HEY, I'M CLIMBING EVEREST.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.033
I COULD BE DEAD TOMORROW.

11:42.067 --> 11:44.800
- LISTEN, RAY!

11:44.833 --> 11:46.133
- I'M GOING AWAY!

11:46.167 --> 11:49.333
- WOULD YOU ROLL THE DICE?

11:49.367 --> 11:52.167
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.567
OKAY.

11:57.867 --> 12:00.467
THREE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

12:00.500 --> 12:04.100
"TELL YOUR LOVER SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU THEY DO NOT KNOW."

12:07.467 --> 12:08.800
I'M BACK FROM EVEREST!

12:08.833 --> 12:13.033
- RAY! RAY, COME ON.
WOULD YOU...STOP IT!

12:13.067 --> 12:15.267
WOULD YOU STOP?

12:19.600 --> 12:22.567
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SHARE
SOMETHING WITH ME.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.833
- I'M TRYING TO!

12:23.867 --> 12:26.067
- COME ON.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.033
- WHERE ARE THE FUN SQUARES?

12:30.067 --> 12:32.133
- THE BLUE SQUARES ARE NAUGHTY.

12:32.167 --> 12:33.967
THE PINK SQUARES ARE ROMANTIC.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.067
- PINK.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.300
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

12:37.333 --> 12:40.433
TELL ME SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

12:40.467 --> 12:42.033
- ALL RIGHT.
SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW.

12:42.067 --> 12:43.333
- OKAY.

12:43.367 --> 12:45.733
- WELL...THIS AFTERNOON

12:45.767 --> 12:47.700
WHEN I WAS TRYING
TO GET YOU SOMETHING...

12:47.733 --> 12:48.633
- YEAH?

12:48.667 --> 12:51.733
- I STOPPED
AND GOT A CHILI DOG.

12:57.033 --> 12:58.433
- JUST GIVE ME THE DICE.
- WAIT, COME ON.

12:58.467 --> 12:59.733
THERE'S NOTHING
BUT PINK SQUARES.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.667
HOLD ON, WHERE'S BLUE?
RIGHT HERE'S BLUE.

13:01.700 --> 13:02.800
THE FIRST BLUE ONE--

13:02.833 --> 13:03.867
"WITHOUT USING YOUR HAND,

13:03.900 --> 13:05.833
REMOVE A PIECE
OF YOUR LOVER'S CLOTHING."

13:05.867 --> 13:10.833
OH, YEAH.
[gnawing sound]

13:10.867 --> 13:11.733
HOLD ON, WHAT DO I NEED?

13:11.767 --> 13:13.267
I NEED A ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.867
OKAY, FIVE'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

13:14.900 --> 13:15.867
COME ON, FIVE, BABY.

13:15.900 --> 13:16.867
- IF WE GET A THREE,

13:16.900 --> 13:18.100
WE GET TO WRITE EACH OTHER
A POEM.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.367
- OH, GOD! PLEASE, NO.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.400
PLEASE, FIVE! COME ON, FIVE!
FIVE!

13:22.433 --> 13:25.567
FEVER IN THE CATHOUSE,
THE DOCTOR AIN'T HOME.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.467
- HA! NINE.

13:26.500 --> 13:27.933
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL MOVE IT FOR YOU.

13:27.967 --> 13:29.133
ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE,

13:29.167 --> 13:30.500
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE--
A BLUE ONE!

13:30.533 --> 13:32.133
- NO, NO, YOU COUNTED
THAT SQUARE TWICE.

13:32.167 --> 13:33.400
- NO, I DIDN'T.
I DIDN'T.

13:33.433 --> 13:35.567
- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE,
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.967
- I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GETTING
INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE GAME.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.867
- LET ME READ THE SQUARE.

13:42.900 --> 13:43.933
"WITHOUT TALKING,

13:43.967 --> 13:46.467
STARE INTO YOUR LOVER'S EYES
FOR THREE MINUTES."

13:46.500 --> 13:48.967
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.400
- THREE MINUTES.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.033
- DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
THREE MINUTES IS?

13:53.067 --> 13:56.033
IT'S LONG.
ASK AN EGG.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.567
- DO IT.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.400
- ALL RIGHT,
LET ME SET MY THING.

14:06.733 --> 14:08.167
OKAY.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.300
READY, GO.

14:30.567 --> 14:32.167
- PUT IT DOWN!

14:36.533 --> 14:38.800
- I DON'T THINK WE'RE GETTING
WHAT'S INTENDED HERE,

14:38.833 --> 14:40.667
'CAUSE YOU'RE STARTIN'
TO LOOK LIKE THE DEVIL.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.100
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, FORGET IT.

14:42.133 --> 14:43.367
- NO, NO, NO!

14:43.400 --> 14:45.400
IT'S JUST THAT MY EYES
ARE BLURRY, THAT'S ALL!

14:45.433 --> 14:46.300
COME ON.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.800
I DIDN'T SAY IT'S NOT ROMANTIC.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.333
RIGHT, THE DEVIL'S HOT.

14:49.367 --> 14:51.433
- WHY CAN'T YOU LOOK
INTO MY EYES?

14:51.467 --> 14:53.000
- BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO BEAUTIFUL.

14:53.033 --> 14:54.267
- OH!

14:54.300 --> 14:56.167
- LOOK, THE GAME'S OBVIOUSLY
RIGGED, ALL RIGHT?

14:56.200 --> 14:58.000
THERE'S TWICE AS MANY
PINK ROMANTIC SQUARES

14:58.033 --> 15:00.167
AS NAUGHTY BLUE ONES.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.167
- WHY DID YOU BUY
THE GAME, RAY, HUH?

15:02.200 --> 15:03.633
THAT'S WHAT I REALLY
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.433
WHY DID YOU BUY IT
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY?

15:05.467 --> 15:07.033
- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.467
IT'S GOT SOMETHING
FOR BOTH OF US:

15:08.500 --> 15:12.333
SEX FOR ME,
READING FOR YOU.

15:12.367 --> 15:15.633
- YOU REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS GAME IS FOR, DO YOU?

15:15.667 --> 15:16.700
- YES, I HAVE AN IDEA.

15:16.733 --> 15:18.700
THE GAME IS TO GET YOU
IN THE MOOD.

15:18.733 --> 15:20.333
REMEMBER THE MOOD?

15:20.367 --> 15:22.167
- NO, THIS GAME
IS NOT ABOUT MY MOOD.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.800
THIS GAME IS SUPPOSED
TO IMPROVE OUR SEX LIFE.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.667
- YEAH, WELL,
THEN I GOT THE WRONG GAME.

15:26.700 --> 15:27.500
I SHOULD'VE GOT THE GAME

15:27.533 --> 15:29.633
THAT GETS YOU
TO HAVE A SEX LIFE.

15:29.667 --> 15:33.567
- OH, YES, YOU'RE
THE POOR SEX-STARVED HUSBAND.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.233
- YEAH, AND YOU'RE THE POOR
PUT-UPON WIFE

15:35.267 --> 15:36.367
WHO DOESN'T GET ANY ROMANCE.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.733
- NO, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT ROMANCE.

15:37.767 --> 15:40.067
I WANTED TO PLAY THIS GAME
FOR OTHER THINGS TOO.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.333
- YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

15:41.367 --> 15:42.500
I DON'T HOLD
YOUR HAND ENOUGH,

15:42.533 --> 15:44.667
WATCH YOU SLEEP,
LISTEN TO YOUR HEARTBEAT,

15:44.700 --> 15:46.500
MUH, MUH, MUH...

15:46.533 --> 15:48.433
AND LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.700
WHAT YOU CALL ROMANCE,
IT'S ALWAYS CHANGING.

15:50.733 --> 15:52.400
SOMETIMES IT'S THAT
YOU WANT FLOWERS,

15:52.433 --> 15:54.467
AND THEN OTHER TIMES--
OTHER TIMES--

15:54.500 --> 15:56.367
HOW ABOUT THE TIME
YOU GOT EXCITED

15:56.400 --> 15:58.233
'CAUSE I BROUGHT HOME
A BUCKET OF CHICKEN?

15:58.267 --> 15:59.667
WHY?
WHAT IS ROMANCE?

15:59.700 --> 16:01.567
TELL ME WHAT IT IS.
I'LL DO IT EVERY TIME.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.867
- LISTEN, RAY, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOU AND THE ROMANCE.

16:03.900 --> 16:08.033
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU
AND...THE BLUE SQUARES.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.267
- WHAT?
THE BLUE SQUARES?

16:09.300 --> 16:11.933
THE BLUE ONES
ARE THE SEX ONES!

16:11.967 --> 16:14.400
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

16:14.433 --> 16:16.200
WHAT?

16:23.933 --> 16:26.200
OH.

16:38.733 --> 16:41.133
THE BLUE SQUARES.

16:44.233 --> 16:47.033
- IS IT ALL RIGHT
IF WE TALK ABOUT IT?

16:51.167 --> 16:52.700
- [whispers]
GO AHEAD.

16:55.200 --> 17:00.467
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL...

17:00.500 --> 17:02.867
FIRST OF ALL,
I LOVE YOU.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.033
- OOHHH...

17:05.067 --> 17:09.500
- BUT WHEN WE ARE

17:09.533 --> 17:11.767
MAKING LOVE...

17:11.800 --> 17:13.267
- OOHHH...

17:13.300 --> 17:15.967
- RAY, JUST LOOK AT ME.
- NO.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.200
- I'M YOUR WIFE.

17:17.233 --> 17:18.800
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS.

17:18.833 --> 17:20.100
COME ON.

17:20.133 --> 17:21.267
- YOUR WIFE IS THE LAST PERSON

17:21.300 --> 17:22.567
YOU WANT TO HEAR
THESE THINGS FROM.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.200
- WHO WOULD YOU RATHER
HEAR IT FROM?

17:24.233 --> 17:27.733
- SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T
HAVE ANY PROOF.

17:27.767 --> 17:31.233
- LOOK, THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ME
TO TALK ABOUT EITHER.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.500
- HOW BAD IS THIS?

17:32.533 --> 17:35.500
- NO, IT'S NOT BAD,
AND IT'S NOT JUST YOU.

17:35.533 --> 17:37.767
- WHO ELSE?

17:37.800 --> 17:39.000
- ME!

17:39.033 --> 17:41.267
RAY, IT'S ABOUT US.

17:41.300 --> 17:44.867
LISTEN.
JUST LISTEN.

17:44.900 --> 17:47.667
I NEED...

17:47.700 --> 17:50.400
MORE...

17:50.433 --> 17:53.400
VARIETY.

17:53.433 --> 17:55.200
- VARIETY?

17:55.233 --> 17:56.667
YOU NEED VARIETY?

17:56.700 --> 17:58.733
OH, I GOT THAT.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.833
I WAS WORRIED YOU WERE GOING
TO MENTION MY--

18:00.867 --> 18:03.200
WELL, WHY BRING IT UP?

18:03.233 --> 18:06.667
BUT VARIETY? I AM VARIETY.
I'M ED SULLIVAN.

18:06.700 --> 18:07.600
VARIETY.

18:07.633 --> 18:09.267
WASN'T I THE GUY WHO CAME
INTO THE BEDROOM

18:09.300 --> 18:10.500
WITH THE COWBOY HAT ON?

18:10.533 --> 18:12.333
HOW ABOUT THE TIME
I WAS THE FIREMAN

18:12.367 --> 18:16.000
AND YOU WERE
THE BURNING SORORITY HOUSE?

18:16.033 --> 18:18.667
- WELL, I MEAN,
BY VARIETY, I MEAN...

18:18.700 --> 18:21.867
LOOK, THE COWBOY
AND THE FIREMAN ARE FUN,

18:21.900 --> 18:25.033
BUT ONCE THEY TAKE
THEIR HATS OFF,

18:25.067 --> 18:27.867
THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.767
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:30.800 --> 18:33.433
- I NEED THEM TO BE...

18:33.467 --> 18:36.967
LESS...SELFISH.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.467
- NOW, HOLD ON.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.567
HOLD ON.
I AM NOT SELFISH!

18:41.600 --> 18:42.800
I AM NOT SELFISH!

18:42.833 --> 18:45.267
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU WANT--ANYTHING--I DO IT!

18:45.300 --> 18:47.067
YOU WANT ME
TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE?

18:47.100 --> 18:48.433
I'M FLEXING!

18:48.467 --> 18:50.167
YOU WANT ME TO TALK
IN AN ACCENT?

18:50.200 --> 18:53.500
"YOU GO' IT, GUV'NER."
HUH?

18:53.533 --> 18:55.600
COME ON,
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.600
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

18:57.633 --> 18:58.633
- I WANT...

18:58.667 --> 18:59.700
- WHAT?

18:59.733 --> 19:01.433
- SEE, THIS IS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

19:01.467 --> 19:04.233
WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO TELL YOU
WHAT I WANT?

19:04.267 --> 19:06.567
- SO I WILL KNOW.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.500
- DO YOU KNOW
HOW DEPRESSING THAT IS,

19:09.533 --> 19:11.533
THAT AFTER 12 YEARS,
YOU DON'T KNOW?

19:11.567 --> 19:13.433
WHY DO I HAVE
TO SAY IT OUT LOUD?

19:13.467 --> 19:17.067
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
BEEN PAYING ATTENTION?

19:17.100 --> 19:18.533
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"PAYING ATTENTION"?

19:18.567 --> 19:21.067
- YOU ONLY SEEM TO PICK UP
THE SIGNALS THAT AFFECT YOU.

19:21.100 --> 19:22.567
LIKE, YOU KNOW
WHAT "I'M TIRED" MEANS

19:22.600 --> 19:24.333
BECAUSE IT MEANS
NO FUN FOR RAYMOND.

19:24.367 --> 19:26.267
BUT IF I GIVE YOU
THE "GO" SIGNAL,

19:26.300 --> 19:27.900
THEN YOU JUST STOP
PAYING ATTENTION.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.167
I COULD SHOOT OFF
A FLARE IN HERE,

19:29.200 --> 19:32.900
AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

19:32.933 --> 19:35.633
- SORRY.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.600
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

19:37.633 --> 19:39.867
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

19:39.900 --> 19:41.200
- SURE.

19:41.233 --> 19:43.233
- AFTER 12 YEARS,
I SHOULD KNOW YOU, RIGHT?

19:43.267 --> 19:44.467
- THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.400
- AFTER 12 YEARS,
SHOULDN'T YOU KNOW ME?

19:46.433 --> 19:47.767
I MEAN, YOU COULD HAVE REALIZED

19:47.800 --> 19:49.833
THAT I WASN'T GETTING
YOUR SIGNALS AFTER...

19:49.867 --> 19:52.133
YEAR THREE.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.467
I MEAN, YOU HAD TO KNOW
THAT YOU WERE MARRIED TO A GUY

19:57.500 --> 19:59.300
WHO OCCASIONALLY
MIGHT MISS A THING OR TWO,

19:59.333 --> 20:01.633
AND MAYBE
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO...

20:01.667 --> 20:04.067
SPEAK UP.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.667
- I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK UP.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.033
- WHY NOT?

20:07.067 --> 20:09.367
- IT'S EMBARRASSING.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.833
- NOT AS EMBARRASSING
AS FINDING OUT

20:10.867 --> 20:13.533
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT WRONG
FOR 12 YEARS.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.233
- YEAH. I--

20:18.267 --> 20:21.167
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.600
OKAY, I'LL TRY
TO SPEAK UP MORE.

20:27.633 --> 20:29.100
- OKAY, GOOD.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.533
THAT'S GOOD.

20:44.533 --> 20:48.800
SO YOU WANNA START
SPEAKIN' UP?

20:48.833 --> 20:49.867
- OKAY.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.367
BUT YOU'LL TRY TO BE
A LITTLE MORE AWARE, RIGHT?

20:51.400 --> 20:52.833
- YEAH, YEAH!
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

20:52.867 --> 20:55.267
- OKAY, AND I DON'T MEAN
JUST IN THE BEDROOM.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.400
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

20:56.433 --> 20:57.767
- IF YOU SEE THE LAUNDRY
LYING AROUND

20:57.800 --> 20:59.500
OR THE BILLS ARE PILING UP
OR THE GARBAGE--

20:59.533 --> 21:01.000
- MAYBE WE SHOULD
START WITH THE SEX

21:01.033 --> 21:02.333
AND THEN SEE HOW FAR WE GET.

21:02.367 --> 21:04.167
- RAY, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT, RIGHT?

21:04.200 --> 21:06.033
- I DO.
I HEAR YOU.

21:06.067 --> 21:07.933
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.700
- OKAY.
THANK YOU, HONEY.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.400
- SO ARE YOU GOING
TO TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT?

21:14.433 --> 21:15.867
- I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.400
- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

21:18.433 --> 21:22.067
- I'D LIKE YOU TO HELP ME
WITH THE LAUNDRY.
