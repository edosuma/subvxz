00:18.918 --> 00:20.220
{\an8}Yeah. Hi.

{\an8}Philip Brownly.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.056
{\an8}I'm a junior
over Briarwood Prep.

00:23.123 --> 00:24.257
{\an8}Oh. Cool.

00:24.991 --> 00:27.494
{\an8}The water fountain
kind of sprayed me.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.962
{\an8}Ah.

00:29.028 --> 00:31.998
{\an8}I didn't want you to think
I was sweaty or drooly.

00:32.064 --> 00:34.601
{\an8}[laughs]
You're even funnier in person.

00:34.667 --> 00:35.969
{\an8}Listen, I'm
the student council president

00:36.035 --> 00:37.103
{\an8}at Briarwood.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.938
Oh, fancy.

00:39.005 --> 00:41.574
You know, We're the number one
private school in Seattle.

00:41.641 --> 00:42.976
Yeah. I heard that.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.611
Don't you guys have, like,
your own private jet?

00:44.677 --> 00:45.912
-Helicopter.
-Right.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.248
I know it was
some sort of flying vehicle.

00:48.314 --> 00:49.649
Yeah.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.985
Well, anyway,
on behalf of Briarwood,

00:52.051 --> 00:53.153
this is for you.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.587
What is it?

00:54.654 --> 00:57.524
An invitation for an interview
with our headmaster,

00:57.590 --> 00:58.925
Mrs. Peeloff.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.493
She thinks you might fit in
nicely at Briarwood.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.028
Wow, thanks.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.531
But wait, isn't Briarwood
really expensive?

01:04.596 --> 01:06.199
Full scholarship.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.768
If Mrs. Peeloff meets you
and everything goes well,

01:08.835 --> 01:10.637
you get to go at Briarwood
for free.

01:10.703 --> 01:12.172
But why me?

01:12.238 --> 01:14.174
Cause you're kind of famous.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.542
You're the star of "iCarly."

01:15.608 --> 01:17.677
Well, are you offering
the same thing for Sam?

01:17.744 --> 01:20.413
We were until we checked
Sam's grades.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.215
I understand.

01:22.282 --> 01:25.018
So think about it
and someone will be in touch.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.553
Okay. Thanks.

01:31.458 --> 01:32.459
Hey, Seth.

01:32.525 --> 01:33.626
Do me a favor and press

01:33.693 --> 01:34.861

there.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.162
Sure.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.197
Just push it?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.598
Yeah. When I say "go."

01:39.599 --> 01:41.267
Okay. Go.

between you

a new mini golf course.

-Oh, cool.
-Yeah, it could be.

a bunch of test holes,

-Freddie is not here yet.
-Give me your cell phone.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.472
What are you doing?

03:59.539 --> 04:00.673
Texting Freddie--

You're unloved now.

04:23.496 --> 04:24.831
Nothing's changed.

04:25.498 --> 04:29.669
A scholarship
to Briarwood Prep?

Oh, yeah. How funny is that?

04:31.738 --> 04:33.873
-Briarwood?
-That snotty rich kid's school?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.274
For the rich and snotty?

04:36.275 --> 04:37.543
They offered you a scholarship?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.712
Well, sort of,
If their headmaster likes me.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.948
But I don't think
I'd want to go to Briarwood.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.583
-Good.
-You better not leave Ridgeway.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.118
Did I just not say
I don't wanna go to Briarwood?

04:45.184 --> 04:46.252
I'm not sure.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.606
Okay.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.408
Okay.

09:35.474 --> 09:37.777
There are two roads
in front of you,

09:37.843 --> 09:39.578
road "A".

09:39.645 --> 09:42.581
And the one on the left--

09:50.089 --> 09:51.757
Thank you.

10:14.847 --> 10:15.881
And surprisingly,

10:15.948 --> 10:17.917
17 members of congress

10:17.984 --> 10:20.219
could fit
into one pair of his pants

10:20.286 --> 10:22.488
which proves
that William Howard Taft

10:22.555 --> 10:24.123
was the fattest president

10:24.190 --> 10:26.158
the United States
has ever known.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.794
Um, will this all be
on the test?

10:28.861 --> 10:32.031
Oh, Carly, here at Briarwood
we don't have tests,

10:32.098 --> 10:33.833
we have frozen yogurt.

10:35.334 --> 10:36.502
Frozen yo--

10:37.970 --> 10:39.472
Oh. Okay.

10:41.107 --> 10:42.375
Would you like any toppings?

10:42.441 --> 10:43.809
Well, I do like nuts.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.044
Nuts.

10:45.911 --> 10:47.847
[bell rings]

10:50.583 --> 10:54.253
Now, who can tell me
how many sides a triangle has?

10:54.320 --> 10:55.788
-Three.
-Correct.

10:57.523 --> 11:00.059
David, please give Carly
a hundred dollars.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.862
I get a hundred bucks

11:02.928 --> 11:04.463
whenever I answer
a question right?

11:04.530 --> 11:05.998
Of course.

11:06.065 --> 11:07.666
This is Briarwood.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.404
Massage time.

11:16.208 --> 11:21.113
Oh, oh, this school is amazing.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.649
I'm gonna have
some more of my yogurt now.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.019
Oh.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.425
Oh, it was just a dream.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.699
Hey and welcome
to the web show.

11:40.766 --> 11:41.801
Huh?

11:41.867 --> 11:42.902
Carly is not on this show
anymore

11:42.968 --> 11:44.370
'cause she goes
to Briarwood now.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.971
And made all new friends,

11:46.038 --> 11:48.474
But don't worry
I'm not alone here.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.476
I'm Gibby.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.777
And I'm Sam.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.313
And this is a little show
we like to call--

11:54.380 --> 11:56.449
iGibby. Okay.

11:56.515 --> 11:57.917
[screams]

11:59.685 --> 12:01.253
Okay, first,
I had a sweet dream,

12:01.320 --> 12:02.788
now I'm having
a nightmare.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.690
I wanna dream sweetly
some more.

12:07.793 --> 12:08.861
Oh.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.196
Oh.

12:10.262 --> 12:12.164
This is nice.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.999
I like Briarwood.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.901
all: [calmly] Briarwood.

12:15.968 --> 12:17.103
Briarwood.

12:17.169 --> 12:19.038
And frozen yogurt.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.506
all: Frozen yogurt.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.308
Frozen yogurt.

12:22.374 --> 12:23.776
With nuts.

12:23.843 --> 12:25.311
all: Nuts.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.313
Nuts.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.948
Nuts.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.483
Yeah.

12:38.457 --> 12:39.758
Sam.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.827
Sam, my mom has been
in a horrible accident.

12:41.894 --> 12:44.029
-Calm down.
-I got to get to the hospital.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.232
My mom's car
is in the bottom--

12:46.298 --> 12:47.833
Your mom's fine.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.969
But, I just got a message
saying--

12:50.035 --> 12:52.404
I sent the message
to your teacher.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.673
I needed to get you
out of class so we could talk.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.108
How did you?

12:56.175 --> 12:58.711
Yes, can you please give
a message to Freddie Benson.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.847
His mother drove her car
into a swimming pool.

13:02.915 --> 13:05.251
You are a sick person.

13:06.418 --> 13:07.419
We've got a problem.

13:07.486 --> 13:09.321
What kind of problem?

13:09.388 --> 13:12.324
In homeroom, Carly told me
she's gonna have that interview

13:12.391 --> 13:14.827
with the headmaster
of Briarwood.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.328
Briarwood?

13:17.696 --> 13:18.964
Carly's gonna go there?

13:19.031 --> 13:20.666
If the headmaster likes her.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.568
Well, who doesn't like Carly?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.770
That's the problem, wiz pants.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.774
Of course she'll like Carly,

13:28.841 --> 13:30.276
and then Carly will go there,

13:30.342 --> 13:33.012
make all new friends
and then bye-bye us.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.214
I don't want to be bye-bye'd.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.416
Good.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.985
'Cause I have a plan,
and you're gonna help me.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.056
Come on.

13:44.123 --> 13:45.057
Come on.

13:48.027 --> 13:49.295
What's taking so long?

13:49.361 --> 13:51.163
I'm still on hold.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.765
Are you sure
we should be doing this?

13:52.831 --> 13:55.634
Yes. We're doing it for Carly,
She would not like Briarwood.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.002
I know, but--

13:57.069 --> 13:59.171
And if she stays here
there's a better chance

13:59.238 --> 14:00.839
she'll fall in love
with you someday.

14:00.906 --> 14:01.974
You're right.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.909
We have to do this for Carly.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.979
But what if the headmaster
doesn't believe I'm Spencer?

14:07.046 --> 14:08.147
I mean, like, what if she--

14:08.214 --> 14:13.852
Hello, this is Spencer Shay.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.123
Sound like Spencer
not Darth Vader.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.760
Ah, yes,
this is Carly Shay's Brother.

14:21.827 --> 14:23.662
Instead of Carly
coming to meet you

14:23.729 --> 14:24.930
at Briarwood,

14:24.997 --> 14:27.499
could you meet with her
at our apartment?

14:27.566 --> 14:28.534
Why?

14:31.003 --> 14:33.405
Because I sprained my buttocks.

14:36.675 --> 14:41.614
Right, so can we say
around 5:30 this afternoon?

14:41.680 --> 14:43.115
Excellent.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.784
Yes, the same address
that you sent the turkey legs.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.886
I look forward
to meeting you too.

14:48.921 --> 14:51.190
-Ha, nice work.
-Thanks.

14:51.257 --> 14:52.558
But why does
moving the interview

14:52.625 --> 14:53.959
to Carly's place help us?

14:54.026 --> 14:55.828
Well, the headmaster
wants to make sure

14:55.894 --> 14:59.031
Carly is, mm,
Briarwood material, right?

14:59.098 --> 15:00.699
A nice proper good girl?

15:00.766 --> 15:01.767
Yeah.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.837
Well, imagine an interview

15:04.903 --> 15:06.138
in an apartment

15:06.205 --> 15:09.508
filled with dozens
of loud screaming kids,

15:09.575 --> 15:11.277
playing mini golf.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.213
"Free mini golf

15:14.280 --> 15:15.914
"tonight
at Carly Shay's apartment,

15:15.981 --> 15:17.549
5:30 to midnight."

15:17.616 --> 15:19.251
Uh-huh.

15:19.318 --> 15:20.486
You're bad.

15:20.552 --> 15:21.887
Uh-huh.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.993
Hey,
what you doing in the sink?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.561
Ah, it's backed up.

15:29.628 --> 15:32.298
Some kid shot a golf ball
down the drain.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.403
There.

15:44.743 --> 15:46.879
I wish that hadn't happened.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.448
Yeah, look,
would you help me

15:49.515 --> 15:50.783
pick out an outfit
for my interview?

15:50.849 --> 15:51.950
Do I go with black dress?

15:52.017 --> 15:53.018
Or is the black dress
too serious,

15:53.085 --> 15:54.186
'cause
I don't want to look like

15:54.253 --> 15:55.254
I'm trying all hard
to be serious,

15:55.321 --> 15:56.922
but, oh, my God,
I'm so nervous.

15:56.989 --> 16:00.326
Okay, everybody right this way.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.362
Hey, hey. What's going on?

16:03.429 --> 16:05.998
-Mini golf party.
-Right now?

16:06.065 --> 16:07.966
I'm getting ready to leave
for my interview.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.535
Your Briarwood interview?

16:09.601 --> 16:11.704
Is that tonight?

16:11.770 --> 16:13.138
Yes, it's tonight.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.540
Don't worry,
We're just gonna play

16:14.606 --> 16:15.874
a few rounds.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.810
Come on you guys,
this isn't the time for--

16:17.876 --> 16:19.378
[doorbell rings]
I'll be right back.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.580
[excited chatter]

16:21.647 --> 16:23.916
The mini golf course is full.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.250
I'm sorry.

16:26.752 --> 16:27.853
My name is Linda Peeloff.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.755
-[loudly] Are you Carly?
-Yeah.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.257
I'm the headmaster
at Briarwood.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.493
I'm here for your interview.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.729
Oh. Ah.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.964
Please come in, Mrs. Peeloff.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.104
Interesting.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.206
Yeah,
wasn't I supposed to meet you

16:47.272 --> 16:49.408
in like two hours at Briarwood?

16:49.475 --> 16:50.943
Originally.

16:51.009 --> 16:54.246
But I received a phone call
ask me to come here at 5:30.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.348
-But who would--
-Move lady.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.753
Dear, is this really
where you live?

17:00.819 --> 17:03.188
Yes, ma'am,
but it's usually not like this,

17:03.255 --> 17:04.522
You see my brother's an artist
and--

17:04.589 --> 17:06.023
Hey, Carly.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.361
Who's the chick?

17:10.796 --> 17:14.700
This is Mrs. Peeloff,
the headmaster of Briarwood.

17:14.767 --> 17:15.867
Hey, hey.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.836
What's up, Peeloff?

17:17.903 --> 17:19.471
Hello.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.006
Aha.

17:21.073 --> 17:23.108
And this is my brother.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.711
Spencer, this is the headmaster
of Briarwood.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.912
-Oh.
-Hello.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.481
How are your buttocks?

17:31.083 --> 17:32.484
[loudly]
My buttocks?

17:32.551 --> 17:33.619
Fine.

17:33.685 --> 17:34.953
Firm.

17:36.021 --> 17:38.323
So, you're Carly's guardian?

17:38.390 --> 17:40.025
Yes I am.

17:40.092 --> 17:42.761
Oh, this is just food.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.096
Lovely.

17:45.030 --> 17:48.500
[bell rings]
<i>Oh!</i>

17:50.369 --> 17:52.538
Mrs. Peeloff,
it's so noisy down here,

17:52.604 --> 17:54.506
Why down we go upstairs
and do the interview?

17:54.573 --> 17:55.641
Very well.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.509
We can take the elevator
over there.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.346
-Why is she here?
-I don't know.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.347
I thought we were gonna
meet her at Briarwood?

18:02.414 --> 18:03.916
-So am I.
-This is terrible.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.284
-She asked about my buttocks.
-Forget about your buttocks.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.852
-Just do your interview.
-Okay, I'm gonna do it.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.220
-Shh.
-Okay, you "shh!"

18:17.729 --> 18:19.331
Ohh.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.304
[indistinct chatter,
music playing]

18:29.608 --> 18:31.844
Oh, um...

18:31.910 --> 18:33.178
Okay, everyone.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.514
Please go play downstairs
for a while.

18:35.581 --> 18:36.815
Guys.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.283
People.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.120
[airhorn blares]
[all groan]

18:42.187 --> 18:44.256
Please get out now.

18:44.323 --> 18:47.025
[aggravated chatter]

18:48.193 --> 18:50.162
Hurry along.
[airhorn blares]

18:52.798 --> 18:54.633
Please sit down, Mrs. Peeloff.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.168
Thank you.

18:56.235 --> 18:57.769
Now Carly--

19:12.518 --> 19:14.853
Why don't you start
by telling me

19:14.920 --> 19:16.488
a little bit about you?

19:17.589 --> 19:18.624
Well--

19:19.858 --> 19:22.494
[toilet flushes, laughter]

19:26.164 --> 19:27.432
Flush.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.703
[excited chatter]

19:31.770 --> 19:34.273
Hey. Quiet down.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.308
Hey listen up.

19:39.845 --> 19:43.148
Okay, whoever finds
the magic purple golf ball

19:43.215 --> 19:44.449
wins a special ticket

19:44.516 --> 19:46.118
that gives you free mini golf
for a year.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.252
A whole year?

19:47.319 --> 19:48.987
Well, give us a hint
where it is?

19:49.054 --> 19:50.489
Okay.

19:50.556 --> 19:52.190
It's upstairs
in the iCarly studio,

19:52.257 --> 19:53.792
inside
a grown up ladies pocket.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.260
First one to find it wins.

19:55.327 --> 19:58.397
[all shouting]

20:00.599 --> 20:04.303
Well, Carly,
you're a charming young lady.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.672
Oh, Mrs. Peeloff.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.874
I'd really think
the student body at--

20:08.941 --> 20:11.443
[all shouting]

20:11.510 --> 20:13.312
Where is it?
Where is it?

20:13.378 --> 20:15.447
What are you doing?
Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.082
Give me the ball, lady.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.483
I want that ball!

20:18.550 --> 20:20.052
Giddy, what are you doing?

20:20.118 --> 20:21.386
Trying to find
the purple golf ball.

20:21.453 --> 20:23.121
What purple golf ball?

20:23.188 --> 20:25.057
The one Sam and Freddie
told us about.

20:25.123 --> 20:28.260
[all shouting]

20:36.268 --> 20:37.669
We are good.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.237
We are.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.176
Why?

20:44.242 --> 20:45.911
Why what?

20:45.978 --> 20:47.412
I'm not playing.

20:47.479 --> 20:50.182
Why did you guys intentionally
sabotage my interview?

20:53.018 --> 20:54.519
[slurping]

20:54.586 --> 20:56.989
Don't nonchalantly sip
your drinks.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.156
Answer me.

20:58.223 --> 21:00.058
We didn't want you to go.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.460
You wouldn't like it
at Briarwood.

21:01.526 --> 21:02.728
We were just thinking of you.

21:02.794 --> 21:05.497
No, you were just thinking
of yourselves.

21:05.564 --> 21:06.798
Carls.

21:06.865 --> 21:08.700
This interview
was really important to me.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.869
You don't wanna go
to snotty rich kid school.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.171
Maybe I don't or maybe I did,
but it doesn't matter now

21:13.238 --> 21:14.406
'cause I'll never be
able to make the choice,

21:14.473 --> 21:16.141
'cause you guys ruined it
for me.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.577
Come on,
what we did wasn't that bad.

21:18.644 --> 21:20.812
[elevator dings]

21:20.879 --> 21:23.181
Hey. Purple ball.

21:23.248 --> 21:26.251
They--they wanted
a purple ball.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.955
I never had a purple ball.

21:31.289 --> 21:33.325
I'm going home now.
[breathing unevenly]

21:33.392 --> 21:34.226
-Wait.
-Mrs. Peeloff.

21:34.292 --> 21:35.460
[shrieks]

21:36.628 --> 21:38.930
Don't blame Carly
for all this stuff.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.465
She had nothing to do with it.

21:40.532 --> 21:42.734
We tried to mess up
her interview cause--

21:42.801 --> 21:46.004
'Cause,
she's like our best friend.

21:46.071 --> 21:48.340
And we didn't want her
to leave our school.

21:48.407 --> 21:49.908
'Cause we'd miss her.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.245
But she likes the best kid

21:53.311 --> 21:54.846
you could ever get
at Briarwood.

21:56.214 --> 21:57.582
So don't not let her in

21:57.649 --> 22:00.585
just because she's got
a couple of rotten friends.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.925
You guys aren't rotten,
usually.

22:08.193 --> 22:09.661
Well, I do think,

22:09.728 --> 22:12.097
there's something to be said
for a girl who has friends,

22:12.164 --> 22:15.100
who care so much about her.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.668
We do.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.272
So I might still get in
to Briarwood?

22:20.338 --> 22:21.673
Well I won't make any promises,

22:21.740 --> 22:22.841
but I think

22:22.908 --> 22:24.443
there's a good chance
a student--

22:24.509 --> 22:26.611
There she went.
Give me the purple ball.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.047
I don't have the purple ball!

22:29.114 --> 22:31.183
There she is!
Get her!

22:31.249 --> 22:32.918
[all shouting]

22:32.984 --> 22:34.219
Oh, my God!

22:34.286 --> 22:36.221
Go help her.

22:36.288 --> 22:37.956
Okay.
[water running]

22:38.023 --> 22:39.624
Hey, guys get out of there.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.827
Come on.

22:41.893 --> 22:44.296
They chased her
into Spencer's shower.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.832
[Spencer yells]

22:48.066 --> 22:50.302
[spitting, shrieking]

22:50.368 --> 22:53.305
[all shouting]

23:03.048 --> 23:05.550
{\an8}I didn't really want to go
to Briarwood anyway.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.492
-Hey.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.427

23:18.730 --> 23:21.133

23:21.199 --> 23:22.467

23:24.803 --> 23:26.304

23:28.106 --> 23:29.641

23:29.708 --> 23:30.742
Stop it.

23:30.809 --> 23:32.010
And that's 17 reasons--

23:32.077 --> 23:34.880
-Why iCarly.com.
-Rocks.
