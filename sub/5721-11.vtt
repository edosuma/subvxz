00:03.610 --> 00:05.123
Six years ago, you got a call
from Will Gardener,

00:05.170 --> 00:07.695
on your voice mail,
and I erased it.

00:10.610 --> 00:11.952
You were about
to go on stage

00:12.010 --> 00:14.228
and stand beside Peter
for his SA run,

00:14.270 --> 00:15.999
and I didn't want
to hurt that.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.056
I listened to the message.

00:22.630 --> 00:24.530
Will said he loved you

00:29.940 --> 00:32.283
And I erased it.

00:32.330 --> 00:35.982
I don't want to stand in the way
of your happiness again.

00:36.030 --> 00:38.157
That's why I'm sorry.

00:47.170 --> 00:49.900
Get out.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.609
ELI:
I'm sorry.

00:53.660 --> 00:55.742
It's bothered me
for theEllast six...
I.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.781
I need you not to talk.

01:01.880 --> 01:02.926
Okay.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.011
Get out of my house.

01:09.060 --> 01:10.880
I'm afraid if
I don't explain...

01:10.940 --> 01:12.623
Do-do you want me to...

01:12.680 --> 01:14.193
[grunting]

01:14.240 --> 01:16.242
[panﬁng]

01:50.540 --> 01:52.929
Alicia, I'll be on the bus,
so I think we should...

01:52.980 --> 01:54.106
[screams]I think...

01:56.810 --> 01:57.936
[screams]

01:57.980 --> 01:58.969

03:27.160 --> 03:29.151
[knocking at door]

03:34.990 --> 03:37.902
JASON:
Alicia, you in there?

03:37.950 --> 03:39.508
[knocking at door]

03:39.560 --> 03:42.085
Alicia?

03:43.960 --> 03:45.211
Hey.

03:45.260 --> 03:46.249
Hey.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.608
You having a party?

03:48.660 --> 03:50.218
No.

03:50.270 --> 03:52.261
Just... came from the shower.

03:52.310 --> 03:54.574
Ah.

03:54.620 --> 03:58.226
Anyway, I was just, um...

03:58.280 --> 03:59.838
heading out, and there was
one more thing.

03:59.890 --> 04:02.404
Uh, prenup,
the one hour capped.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.283
Uh, your husband
wanted me look into

04:07.330 --> 04:09.104
Howard Lyman's
finances.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.287
Oh, right.Jackie's prenup.

04:11.330 --> 04:15.289
Seems like your potential
stepfather-in-law

04:15.340 --> 04:17.376
secreted away $2.2 million.

04:17.430 --> 04:20.388
It was sheltered
in Relic Holdings,

04:20.430 --> 04:23.035
a Delaware corporation.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.298
Okay, thanks.

04:25.350 --> 04:27.955
Are... are you all right?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.695
Yes.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.913
You look... distracted.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.689
No, just... packing.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.308
You know, trying
to get out the door.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.136
Right, uh...

04:38.190 --> 04:39.396
Iowa.

04:39.450 --> 04:40.701
The caucus.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.058
Good luck.

04:42.100 --> 04:45.103
Thanks.

04:45.150 --> 04:47.402
Okay, um...

04:47.460 --> 04:48.939
I'll see you.

04:48.980 --> 04:50.322
Yes.

04:50.370 --> 04:51.712
Good.

04:59.470 --> 05:02.075
[acoustic guitar playing
the melody of "O Tannenbaum"]

05:06.910 --> 05:11.347
You ask what land
I love the best

05:11.390 --> 05:13.654
Iowa, 'tis Iowa

05:13.700 --> 05:17.659
The fairest state
in all the west

05:17.700 --> 05:22.262
Iowa, 0 Iowa

05:22.320 --> 05:25.096
From yonder
Mississippi stream

05:25.150 --> 05:26.276
To where Missouri...

05:26.320 --> 05:28.276
[clamoring]

05:28.320 --> 05:30.276
Wait, wait, wait!
This is not a democracy.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.752
I'll decide
which way we're gonna be...

05:31.800 --> 05:33.142
In consultation
with the candidate...

05:33.200 --> 05:35.191
Yes, Eli, thank you,
in consultation with Peter.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.582
I've run five campaigns in Iowa,

05:36.640 --> 05:38.119
and this is the first time

05:38.160 --> 05:39.889
we have the "Full Grassley"
in sight.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.282
The "Full Grassley"
doesn't mean anything.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.762
Yeah, when we were
all driving Studebakers...

05:42.820 --> 05:43.764
I've already decided.

05:43.820 --> 05:44.764
I don't need
to hear from you.

05:44.820 --> 05:46.071
JOSH:
But there's this thing

05:46.120 --> 05:47.815
called the Internet now.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.202
It's this marvelous device.
You should take a look at it.

05:49.260 --> 05:50.386
Yes, and the Internet
still doesn't have

05:50.430 --> 05:51.385
the reach of
the nightly news.

05:51.430 --> 05:53.773
[clamor resumes]

05:53.830 --> 05:55.127
Whatcha reading?

05:57.130 --> 05:58.563
Jane Eyre.

05:58.610 --> 06:00.487
Why?

06:01.830 --> 06:03.707
I want to.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.229
Mom, are you okay?

06:07.270 --> 06:08.578
I am great.

06:08.620 --> 06:10.178
ZACH:
I don't know how
people live out here;

06:10.230 --> 06:13.313
there's nothing to do.You're on a bus with an Xbox.

06:13.370 --> 06:15.270
Yeah, but they don't
have Xboxes.How do you know that?

06:15.330 --> 06:16.365
This isn't Amish Country.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.809
ZACH:
That's not the point.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.363
The point is that...
well, look out there.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.808
I mean, what is this?
Cornfield County?

06:20.850 --> 06:21.805
There's nothing
out there.

06:21.850 --> 06:22.805
GRACE:
Relax. Just enjoy it.

06:22.860 --> 06:27.422
No one's more happy

06:27.470 --> 06:28.983
Than you

06:31.730 --> 06:38.078
Even the slq's
feeling blue...

06:40.050 --> 06:42.211
And you don't believe

06:42.270 --> 06:43.487
Getting carsick?

06:43.530 --> 06:45.691
Believe, but it's true...

06:45.750 --> 06:47.741
[song fades]Nope.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.223
Because when you read,
you get carsick.

06:49.270 --> 06:51.443
I'm not now.

06:51.490 --> 06:52.479
RUTH :
Peter!

06:52.540 --> 06:54.019
Can you help us decide?

06:54.060 --> 06:56.312
Are you all still arguing?

06:56.370 --> 06:57.792
JOSH: We're coming
to the fork,

06:57.850 --> 06:59.363
Mr. Governor, in ten miles.

06:59.410 --> 07:00.229
We either head east
toward Des Moines—-

07:00.280 --> 07:02.020
which is the smart choice--

07:02.070 --> 07:03.719
Or continue north toward
Rock Valley, as we agreed.

07:03.770 --> 07:05.374
Ruth says that
the "Full Grassley"

07:05.420 --> 07:07.468
will give us the lead story
on the nightly news.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.807
Yeah, nightly news
coverage worked

07:08.860 --> 07:10.111
when Kennedy was running, so...

07:10.160 --> 07:11.593
ELI: Peter, we built
this campaign

07:11.640 --> 07:13.858
using sophisticated
voter targeting

07:13.910 --> 07:15.423
based on computer models

07:15.470 --> 07:16.459
and micro-advertising...

07:16.520 --> 07:18.476
Alicia, have you got a minute?

07:18.520 --> 07:19.475
Candidates have proven that
completing the "Full Grassley"

07:19.520 --> 07:21.169
translates to huge support.

07:21.220 --> 07:23.472
Rick Santorum did it, and
went from dead in the water

07:23.530 --> 07:25.259
to coming within eight votes
of winning the state.

07:25.310 --> 07:27.039
JOSH: And by the spring,
he'd dropped out of the race.

07:27.090 --> 07:28.648
Well, I know that covering
three counties

07:28.700 --> 07:31.316
before 5:00 pm. is difficult,
but we also have to...

07:31.360 --> 07:32.520
Alicia.

07:32.580 --> 07:33.877
We have to hit
three counties

07:33.930 --> 07:35.272
to hit to complete
"The Full Grassley."

07:35.320 --> 07:36.480
Do you know what that is?

07:36.540 --> 07:37.962
It's named after
Senator Chuck Grassley.

07:38.020 --> 07:39.499
A candidate visits
all 99 counties

07:39.540 --> 07:41.144
in Iowa in
a campaign cycle.

07:41.190 --> 07:42.327
RUTH: It shows the candidate
cares for the state...

07:42.370 --> 07:43.496
It shows the candidate's
desperate.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.847
RUTH:
We stop for 15 minutes,

07:44.890 --> 07:46.152
Peter eats some local delicacy,

07:46.200 --> 07:47.633
like a loose meat sandwich...

07:47.680 --> 07:48.840
What's a loose meat sandwich?

07:48.900 --> 07:50.117
A sandwich with loose meat.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.286
PETER:
Just one second.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.728
All right, here is our dilemma:

07:52.770 --> 07:55.295
Hitting three counties
before 5:00 pm.

07:55.340 --> 07:57.069
is going to be extremely
difficult. Do we risk it?

07:57.120 --> 07:58.519
What does Ruth want?

07:58.560 --> 08:00.164
The Full Grassley.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.640
Then I'd do that.

08:05.260 --> 08:06.955
[phone ringing]

08:07.000 --> 08:08.262
Alicia.

08:08.310 --> 08:09.390
Hi, it's Lucca.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.044
I'm about to go
into the prenup.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.830
I just wanted to know
how contentious

08:12.880 --> 08:14.177
we're willing to let this get.

08:14.230 --> 08:15.743
Well, I guess you should just

08:15.790 --> 08:17.576
let Jackie and Howard
take the lead.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.406
Well, they're like love birds
right now.

08:19.450 --> 08:20.667
ALICIA: So go easy.

08:20.710 --> 08:23.531
But your husband seemed
to want to push this.

08:23.590 --> 08:24.454
Oh.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.401
Uh-oh, I better get in there.

08:27.460 --> 08:29.416
Okay. Good luck.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.542
_ _ DAVID:
This IS a pro-forma prenup;

08:31.590 --> 08:33.239
I see no reason
to belabor It.

08:33.290 --> 08:34.541
Neither do I.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.376
A pen.
My kingdom for a pen!

08:37.420 --> 08:39.069
[both laugh]

08:39.120 --> 08:40.815
LUCCA: Before we sign,
we need to talk

08:40.860 --> 08:42.339
about Relic Holdings.

08:42.390 --> 08:43.425
Relic what?

08:43.470 --> 08:45.290
Sounds like a rash
I once had.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.556
[Howard and Jackie laugh]

08:46.610 --> 08:47.861
LUCCA:
You've never heard of it?

08:47.910 --> 08:49.821
No. Why?

08:49.870 --> 08:51.781
Relic Holdings was
incorporated last year,

08:51.830 --> 08:53.786
in Delaware,
under your name.

08:53.830 --> 08:57.652
It's a shell corporation,
a paper entity

08:57.710 --> 09:00.315
used to conceal
$2.2 million.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.351
Howard, are you trying
to hide money from me?

09:02.410 --> 09:03.661
No.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.189
Really.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.571
I have no idea
what this is about.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.588
We're going to need a recess.

09:09.630 --> 09:11.939
We have a problem.

09:11.980 --> 09:13.538
Yes, David, we're in a meeting
with someone right now.

09:13.590 --> 09:14.807
No, it can't wait.

09:14.850 --> 09:16.112
This is Ms. Creech...

09:16.160 --> 09:17.195
Nice to meet you.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.808
It's veryimportant.

09:18.860 --> 09:21.249
...from the Illinois Fair
Employment Practices Agency.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.167
Why, hello, Ms. Screech.

09:23.210 --> 09:24.552
Creech.
Creech.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.942
It's always good to have
someone like you drop by.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.467
I'm investigating
your firm

09:27.520 --> 09:29.340
for discriminatory
hiring practices.

09:29.390 --> 09:31.346
DIANE: Iwas just
telling Ms. Creech

09:31.390 --> 09:33.438
that we recently hired
an exceptionally diverse

09:33.480 --> 09:35.129
group of associates.

09:35.180 --> 09:36.340
Unfortunately,
we received a complaint.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.129
From whom?That's confidential,

09:38.180 --> 09:39.966
as I'm sure you understand.

09:41.970 --> 09:43.699
This has Canning's
fingerprints all over it.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.399
No, I don't think so.

09:45.450 --> 09:46.838
He's in full
take-down mode.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.790
It's retribution
for the Dipple case.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.398
No, FEPA doesn't work that fast.

09:50.450 --> 09:52.008
We have another
problem, too.

09:52.060 --> 09:55.143
Do you remember the DePietro
settlement? $2.2 million?

09:55.200 --> 09:57.498
David, can we focus like we...I hid the money in
a shell corporation

09:57.550 --> 09:59.063
so Alicia wouldn't_
get her hands on it

09:59.120 --> 10:01.930
when she was trying to screw us
over her exit package.

10:01.990 --> 10:03.639
And we're...

10:03.690 --> 10:04.941
What?

10:04.990 --> 10:06.719
Seriously? "What"?

10:06.780 --> 10:08.645
You committed fraud.

10:08.690 --> 10:11.158
No. I_ committed...
selective dep05iting.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.643
Oh, dear God.

10:12.690 --> 10:15.158
Just take care of it.

10:15.220 --> 10:17.654
[triumphant brass intro
Playing]

10:17.700 --> 10:20.089
Let's sing of
Grand Old Ioway

Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho

10:22.270 --> 10:23.965
Our love is stronger
every day

10:24.010 --> 10:25.614
Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho

10:25.660 --> 10:27.218
So come along
and join the song...

10:27.270 --> 10:28.487
So this was a good idea.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.963
Good rally, Ruth.
Shut up.

10:31.020 --> 10:32.271
Do you have any advance at all?

10:32.320 --> 10:33.844
Yes, but we're stretched thin.

10:33.890 --> 10:35.232
Let's do it.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.668

10:39.020 --> 10:40.499
Joy on every hand

10:40.550 --> 10:44.111
We're from Ioway, Ioway...

10:44.160 --> 10:45.809
RUTH: It's not about
the crowds, Governor.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.760
You'll never beat Hillary
and Bernie's crowds.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.299
Apparently not.

10:49.340 --> 10:50.500
MAN:
Yay!

10:50.560 --> 10:52.289
Peter Florrick for president!

10:52.340 --> 10:53.682
Peter is the man!

10:53.740 --> 10:56.208
Is that the advance?
No.

10:56.260 --> 10:58.034
Mr. Florrick-- _
sorry, Governor Florrick--

10:58.090 --> 10:59.648
and soon to be
President Florrick--

10:59.700 --> 11:01.429
I am a Florrick fanatic.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.529
I am an honest-to-God,
Number One Florrick fanatic.

11:04.570 --> 11:06.561
Neil Howard Sloan-Jacob.

11:06.620 --> 11:07.609
Uh, thank you, Mister...

11:07.660 --> 11:08.877
Sloan-Jacob.

11:08.920 --> 11:09.875
You don't remember
me, do you?

11:09.930 --> 11:11.704
Well, I remember you.

11:11.750 --> 11:14.628
[rapping]: Peter's gonna
be an amazing president

11:14.670 --> 11:17.491
He'll make the country great
for every resident

11:17.540 --> 11:19.667
It's evident he's relevant
to our government!

11:19.720 --> 11:20.709
[sings a rhythm,
then chuckles]

11:20.760 --> 11:21.931
You want to do a selfie?

11:21.980 --> 11:23.675
Yeah?
Um...

11:23.720 --> 11:24.937
Where's your
advance team, Ruth?

11:24.980 --> 11:27.448
Stop poisoning Peter.

11:27.510 --> 11:29.466
It's not about the crowds,
it's about how it's reported.

11:29.510 --> 11:31.410
And who will report it?

11:31.470 --> 11:32.721
Any reporter worth his salt
is gonna photograph

11:32.770 --> 11:34.203
how empty this all is.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.512
Well, that's why
I got a reporter

11:35.560 --> 11:37.642
who isn't worth his salt.

11:37.690 --> 11:39.908
Democratic Presidential
candidate Peter Florrick

11:39.960 --> 11:42.906
is on pace to complete
"the Full Monty,"

11:42.960 --> 11:46.430
a feat only attempted
by the bravest politicians:

11:46.480 --> 11:49.745
visiting all of the 70...
89 Iowa counties

11:49.790 --> 11:51.746
by the 5:00 pm. cutoff.

11:51.790 --> 11:53.519
And here to tell the tale

11:53.580 --> 11:56.003
is none other than the candidate
himself, Peter Florrick.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.573
Good to see you, Ted.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.360
And good to see you, too.

11:59.410 --> 12:01.366
And it looks like your fans
are out in force today.

12:01.410 --> 12:02.718
[whoops]

12:02.760 --> 12:04.364
We love you, Peter!

12:04.410 --> 12:05.672
[cheering]

12:05.720 --> 12:06.675
They sure seem
to love you.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.153
Nice costume.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.679
Thanks, I'm
a Florrick fanatic.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.063
[chuckles] Uh, three more
counties to go, Ted.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.599
Just three more counties.

12:13.640 --> 12:16.370
And you have four
and a half hours to go.

12:16.430 --> 12:19.160
SLOAN-JACOB [chanting]:
We can do it. Who can do it?

12:19.210 --> 12:20.905
ALL:
We can do it!

12:20.950 --> 12:23.475
SLOAN-JACOB: Who can do it?ALL: We can do it!

12:23.520 --> 12:25.476
[slow electric guitar
intro playing]

12:25.520 --> 12:29.479
No one's more happy

12:29.530 --> 12:31.828
Than you

12:33.880 --> 12:35.780
[song fading]:
Even the slq...

12:35.840 --> 12:38.308
Don't worry.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.146
Peter will be happy

12:40.190 --> 12:42.226
when you surround him
with cheering people.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.198
I hope this campaign
isn't over tomorrow.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.196
I'd really like to get
to know you, Alicia.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.969
Why?

12:51.030 --> 12:52.372
You're...

12:52.420 --> 12:53.546
interesting.

12:53.590 --> 12:55.467
_ You don't let
things confuse you.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.506
I'm not sure that's true.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.642
I used to think I knew
what life was about,

13:01.690 --> 13:03.646
but I don't have a clue.

13:03.690 --> 13:06.682
Cherish that moment.

13:06.740 --> 13:10.699
When you realize you don't
know what life's about.

13:10.740 --> 13:12.958
That's truth.

13:15.570 --> 13:17.526
You think you could
ever be happy?

13:17.570 --> 13:21.313
If you had taken a...
left instead of a right

13:21.360 --> 13:25.626
or went up instead of down,
you would've been happy?

13:25.670 --> 13:27.103
No.

13:27.150 --> 13:28.663
Really?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.449
You can't control fate.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.060
It's in your genes.

13:33.110 --> 13:34.589
Can't change that.

13:34.630 --> 13:37.849
So whatever I do,
whatever I did...

13:37.900 --> 13:39.674
I'd end up right back here?

13:39.730 --> 13:42.688
Well, maybe not here,
but someplace like here.

13:42.730 --> 13:45.164
At the end of every fork,
there's a cliff.

13:45.210 --> 13:47.462
Go ahead, take
"the road less traveled."

13:47.520 --> 13:49.420
You'll still find that cliff.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.523
I think ifI could go back
to Georgetown right now...

13:59.530 --> 14:02.579
...back to Criminal Law 101,

14:02.620 --> 14:04.838
seat 35L--

14:04.880 --> 14:07.348
that was my seat--

14:07.410 --> 14:09.366
I would've said yes.

14:09.410 --> 14:11.366
Yes to what?

14:11.410 --> 14:13.583
There was a young man...

14:13.630 --> 14:15.188
in love with me.

14:17.720 --> 14:21.417
Um, why don't we go
on the bus, Alicia?

14:21.460 --> 14:23.416
No, I'm good.

14:23.470 --> 14:24.812
[fading in]:
...happy than you

14:28.210 --> 14:31.680
[no voices] Even the slq's

14:31.740 --> 14:34.868
Feeling blue

14:36.650 --> 14:40.609
And you don't believe

14:40.660 --> 14:43.959
But it's true...

14:45.530 --> 14:49.409
No one's more happy

14:49.450 --> 14:50.701
Than you.

15:02.070 --> 15:03.935
Did you file a discriminatory
hiring claim with FEPA?

15:03.990 --> 15:04.934
Excuse me?

15:04.990 --> 15:06.116
Did you file a discriminatory

15:06.160 --> 15:07.240
hiring claim with FEPA?

15:07.290 --> 15:09.372
You know you can't ask me that.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.500
You did, didn't you?

15:11.560 --> 15:13.118
I didn't file it with FEPA,

15:13.170 --> 15:14.728
I filed it with the EEOC.
But I withdrew it.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.123
As soon as I started working
here, I withdrew the complaint.

15:17.170 --> 15:19.775
Unfortunately, Illinois has
a work-share agreement

15:19.830 --> 15:21.252
with the Feds.

15:21.310 --> 15:23.119
Well, then I'll just
withdraw the complaint.

15:23.180 --> 15:24.215
CARY: You c_an't--_not_once
they start investigating.

15:24.270 --> 15:25.999
They started?

15:26.050 --> 15:28.302
Yes, the rep is in our
conference room right now.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.260
That's too bad, isn't it?

15:32.320 --> 15:33.355
Is that sarcasm?

15:33.410 --> 15:34.354
Because we hired you.

15:34.410 --> 15:35.274
Yes.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.015
After you didn't.Monica...

15:37.060 --> 15:39.449
this is serious.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.979
I need you
to drive faster.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.545
We have to get
to Merrill by 2:00.

15:43.590 --> 15:47.060
So tell us about
"the Full Monty," Mr. Gold.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.467
The Full Grassley.

15:50.510 --> 15:52.284
The Full...
I don't understand.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.763
Uh, Grassley, I think
that's what you mean.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.378
"Monty" means taking
off your clothes.

15:56.430 --> 15:57.647
[chuckles] We certainly
don't want any of that here,

15:57.690 --> 15:59.476
do we, sir?
[chuckles]

15:59.520 --> 16:01.988
Could you just
give me a second?

16:05.570 --> 16:07.049
Alicia, give me
five minutes.

16:07.090 --> 16:08.307
You don't need to talk.

16:08.350 --> 16:10.352
Just _listen_ to me
for five minutes.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.356
It's a nightmare just
watching you like this.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.265
You know what
the nightmare is?

16:14.320 --> 16:16.538
Being here,
when I want to be home.

16:16.580 --> 16:20.311
Being on a bus
in the middle of Iowa.

16:20.370 --> 16:21.883
That's the nightmare.

16:21.930 --> 16:23.329
Now leave me alone.

16:26.150 --> 16:28.106
DAVID: It was a clerical
error, Howard.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.378
I'm sorry if it caused
you and Jackie strife.

16:30.420 --> 16:33.412
Well, maybe it wasn't
a clerical error.

16:33.470 --> 16:36.428
Maybe the money
really is mine.

16:36.470 --> 16:38.426
[both laugh]

16:38.470 --> 16:40.597
No, it was a mistake.

16:40.650 --> 16:44.120
But for tax reasons, it's
a little difficult to unravel.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.389
So what I'd like you to do
is just play along,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.305
admit the money is yours.

16:49.350 --> 16:51.818
And we will make it
worth your while.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.611
What, um, what does that
mean, "worth my while"?

16:55.660 --> 16:57.969
It means I'll be appreciative.

16:58.010 --> 16:59.966
[chuckling]:
No. No, no, no.

17:00.010 --> 17:01.147
How much?

17:03.500 --> 17:05.274
$10,000.
[chuckles]

17:07.110 --> 17:08.270
Half of it.

17:08.330 --> 17:09.809
[laughing]: What?

17:09.850 --> 17:11.283
Are you kidding?

17:11.330 --> 17:13.412
It's all in my name,
all 2.2 million.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.849
[chuckling]: I don't see why
I shouldn't keep all of it.

17:17.510 --> 17:19.023
Governor Florrick is on pace

17:19.080 --> 17:20.684
to complete the Full Grassley.

17:20.730 --> 17:22.209
It's a bold move and one...

17:22.250 --> 17:24.036
"Bold move."
That's what we want.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.332
No one's counting the
crowd in Rock Valley.

17:26.390 --> 17:29.029
Matthews is an_ outlier. _
No one else is talking about it.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.739
ZACH: Backroom is.JOSH: Backroom...

17:30.780 --> 17:33.863

if it gets them more clicks.

every day

17:42.930 --> 17:43.874
Here we go. Merrill.

17:43.930 --> 17:44.919
Oh...

17:44.970 --> 17:47.143
What delicacy do we eat here?

17:47.190 --> 17:49.408
Loose meat sandwiches.Again?

17:49.450 --> 17:51.452
Don't let anyone hear
you say that.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.717
Iowans have no sense of humor

17:52.760 --> 17:55.149
about their I_oose meat
sandWIches.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.452
Ioway!
State of all the land...

17:57.510 --> 17:59.068
Well, at least
there's more people here.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.803
Yeah. Press is doing their job.

18:00.860 --> 18:03.465
Governor! Alicia!
Kids, let's go.

18:03.510 --> 18:05.774
We have to hurry.
Ten minutes here,
eat a sandwich,

18:05.820 --> 18:09.551
back on the bus, or we'll never
make it to Anthon! Let's go!

Peter Florrick
for president!

18:21.010 --> 18:23.524
SLOAN-JACOB:
Peter! Peter Florrick

18:23.580 --> 18:25.571
for president! Peter...

18:25.620 --> 18:28.350
["Iowa Corn Song" finishes
with a flourish]

18:28.410 --> 18:30.401
Would anyone mind telling me
what the hell is going on

18:30.450 --> 18:33.271
in Plymouth County?We didn't spend
on the media budget.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.662
And that makes them
angry?

18:34.720 --> 18:36.676
You guys
should probably check out Glare.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.620
ALICIA:
You know what the nightmare is?

18:38.680 --> 18:41.899
Being here when I want
to be home. Being on a bus

18:41.940 --> 18:45.159
in the middle of Iowa.
That's the nightmare.

18:45.210 --> 18:47.553
What the...? How did...?ALICIA: Now leave me alone.

18:51.950 --> 18:54.384
You're not here to _record
private conversations.

18:54.430 --> 18:57.160
You're here to
record the news.Yes, sorry. That wasn't me.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.642
That was my producer.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.042
Yeah, but you recorded it.Not intentionally.

19:00.090 --> 19:01.785
Please don't be mad at me.

19:01.830 --> 19:03.479
ALICIA:
What do you want me to do?

19:03.530 --> 19:06.090
I need you to apologize for
the "nightmare" comment.

19:06.140 --> 19:07.744
Okay.

19:07.790 --> 19:10.315
Say it was only a nightmare
to be here because you were

19:10.360 --> 19:12.316
concerned for your children.
Grace has a cold,

19:12.360 --> 19:13.964
and you wanted
to be home with her.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.408
Does Grace have a cold?

19:15.450 --> 19:17.714
Sniffles.
All the media attention

19:17.760 --> 19:19.534
is hard on a mother
who's protective

19:19.590 --> 19:21.285
of her children.
Can you say that?

19:21.330 --> 19:23.195
Yes.I'l| get Ted to
interview you.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.323
We need to get this out there
before we hit the last county.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.158
Still thinking about first love?

19:34.650 --> 19:36.777
Sit back down.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.215
I was in love.

19:46.270 --> 19:48.226
A long time ago.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.524
He was a pollster.
I was a lowly volunteer.

19:51.580 --> 19:54.925
I won't tell you what campaign,
'cause it'll date me.

19:54.970 --> 19:58.701
He wanted children; I didn't.
So that was it.

20:00.370 --> 20:03.362
I remember the last time
I saw him.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.968
Everything about it.

20:05.020 --> 20:07.454
It was the middle of a sidewalk.

20:07.510 --> 20:11.549
The light just turned yellow,

20:11.600 --> 20:15.718
and I had to go one way
and he had to go the other.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.810
And it was the best kiss
of my life.

20:21.870 --> 20:26.386
The absolute best.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.431
For a long time,
I wondered

20:28.480 --> 20:31.085
how my life would've changed
if I'd said yes to him.

20:33.620 --> 20:37.260
Until I saw last year he was
sent to prison for mail fraud.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.187
_ That looked like
it was gonna go somewhere.

20:43.240 --> 20:46.846
Whatever you think you
could've changed in your life

20:46.890 --> 20:50.360
or in his, you couldn't have.

20:50.420 --> 20:51.808
Oh.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.499
I don't know if that's true.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.541
[whispers]:
It is true.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.420
You know why?

20:58.950 --> 21:01.168
I just told you.

21:02.340 --> 21:03.386
WILLOUGHBY:
Mrs. Florrick,

21:03.430 --> 21:04.681
how are you?Good, Ted.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.992
It's a beautiful day in Iowa.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.304
And we are sampling
all the great food

21:09.350 --> 21:11.432
in each town as we pass through.And I guess

21:11.480 --> 21:15.962
that you feel that some remarks
that we reported were...

21:16.010 --> 21:18.478
misreported on you.Yes. When I was caught

21:18.530 --> 21:21.488
saying it was a nightmare
to be here.

21:21.540 --> 21:24.361
What I actually meant was
it was a nightmare to be away

21:24.410 --> 21:28.369
from my kitchen,
when one of my kids has a cold.

21:28.410 --> 21:30.935
I was hoping to take care
of my kids.

21:30.980 --> 21:35.542
I'm sure every mom can relate.

21:35.590 --> 21:37.638
I'm so sorry, my dear,
but I wasn't trying

21:37.680 --> 21:41.468
to hide anything from you.
It's just that I simply forgot.

21:41.510 --> 21:43.501
$2.2 million?It happens

21:43.560 --> 21:44.948
all the time.
Just last week...

21:44.990 --> 21:46.332
We're going to need
a full accounting.

21:46.390 --> 21:47.869
Times, dates,
all the specifics.

21:47.910 --> 21:50.344
Be my guest. But I am
innocent of everything,

21:50.390 --> 21:51.869
except being old.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.344
Last night, I left
the fridge door open.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.129
Everything melted,

21:56.180 --> 21:58.216
including that marzipan
you gave me.That's unfortunate,

21:58.270 --> 22:00.613
but we're still going
to need documentation.

22:02.230 --> 22:03.310
[whispers]

22:04.930 --> 22:06.010
Excuse us for a moment.

22:06.060 --> 22:08.927
Would you?

22:10.800 --> 22:12.848
You're buying this?

22:12.890 --> 22:14.369
When you get to my age,

22:14.420 --> 22:16.365
you see this happen.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.809
And it only gets worse,
which is why this prenup

22:18.850 --> 22:20.989
will need to account
for more than just ﬁnances.

22:21.030 --> 22:22.372
What do you have in mind?

22:22.420 --> 22:24.684
If I'm going to be
taking care of Howard,

22:24.730 --> 22:27.119
I'll need
full power of attorney.

22:29.950 --> 22:32.475
CARY: Do you think she's
selling us out?

22:32.520 --> 22:34.169
No.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.821
How'd it go?

22:40.880 --> 22:42.689
She saw the interview video
I posted online.

22:42.750 --> 22:44.479
I thought you took that down.I did.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.441
But I might have
included a link to it

22:46.490 --> 22:48.219
in my EEOC complaint.

22:48.270 --> 22:49.225
Of course.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.089
She thinks you hired me

22:51.150 --> 22:52.401
just so I'd withdraw
the complaint.

22:52.450 --> 22:53.712
I kept telling her
that's not true,

22:53.760 --> 22:56.274
but... she wants to talk
to both of you.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.465
[triumphant brass
intro playing]

23:04.510 --> 23:06.410
Let's sing
to grand old Ioway

23:06.470 --> 23:08.199
Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho...

23:08.250 --> 23:11.515
SLOAN-JACOB [distant]: Are you
ready for Peter Florrick?

23:11.560 --> 23:14.165
Are you ready
for the man himself?

23:14.210 --> 23:15.939
[crowd cheering]

23:16.000 --> 23:17.388
Peter's smarter...

23:17.430 --> 23:19.432
The important thing
is we did it--

23:19.480 --> 23:22.529
the Full Grassley with
five minutes to spare.

23:22.570 --> 23:25.266
...I'm right, Peter's gonna
win come election night!

23:25.310 --> 23:27.699
So now, you get off,

23:27.750 --> 23:30.002
you shake a few hands,
eat a last loose meat sandwich--

23:30.060 --> 23:31.539
Oh, please, please,
not another one.

23:31.580 --> 23:33.229
Five minutes
of the stump,

23:33.280 --> 23:34.759
and we're back on the
bus for Des Moines.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.620
Is this really gonna matter?

23:36.670 --> 23:37.796
We do what we can.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.192
The good Lord does the rest.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.458
Hmm.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.195
Peter's smarter
than Einstein

23:43.240 --> 23:44.844
He's got brains
like L.A.'s got sunshine

23:44.900 --> 23:46.549
Let me hear you now

23:46.590 --> 23:48.148
Tell me that I'm right

23:48.200 --> 23:50.760
Peter's gonna win
come election night

23:50.820 --> 23:52.981
I never hesitate
to talk about my Peter

23:53.040 --> 23:55.383
There are other names,
but Peter's gonna beat 'em

23:55.430 --> 23:58.649
Peter's gonna win
come election night

23:58.690 --> 24:01.648
[crowd clamoring, cheering]

24:01.700 --> 24:05.045
Peter's gonna win
come election night...

24:05.090 --> 24:07.046
It sounds like a party's
going on there.

24:07.090 --> 24:09.695
WOMAN: Yes, Chris,
the mood here is infectious,

24:09.750 --> 24:12.480
as Peter Florrick finishes
the Full Grassley

24:12.530 --> 24:14.486
with ﬁve minutes to spare.

24:14.540 --> 24:15.484
CHRIS MATTHEWS:
Five minutes? Wow!

24:15.540 --> 24:16.666
We did it.
Yeah.

24:16.710 --> 24:18.268
I need a drink.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.708
[chuckles]REPORTER: ...here's a highlight
from the rally.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.751
I need to hear you now,
tell me that I'm right

24:21.800 --> 24:23.108
Peter's gonna win
come election night!

24:23.150 --> 24:24.879
So, 24 more hours?

24:24.940 --> 24:27.238
Just the caucus tomorrow
and all Will be revealed.

24:27.290 --> 24:28.712
What's considered winning?

24:28.770 --> 24:29.714
For us?

24:29.770 --> 24:31.067
Second place.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.338
And... losing?

24:33.380 --> 24:34.506
Third place.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.118
Can we do it?

24:37.170 --> 24:39.115
Do you want to do it?

24:40.340 --> 24:42.205
I have no idea.

24:43.690 --> 24:44.861
Well, then fasten your seatbelt.

24:44.910 --> 24:46.468
You think today was crazy?

24:46.520 --> 24:51.048
Tomorrow will show you
how insane democracy can get.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.138
Catch Florrick Fever!
You've got Florrick Fever!

24:53.180 --> 24:55.910
Peter Florrick, 2016!Uh-oh.

24:55.970 --> 24:57.050
NEWSWOMAN:
Chris, is Governor Florrick

24:57.100 --> 24:58.613
spitting out
his loose meat sandwich?

25:07.590 --> 25:10.024
So, turning to the next issue:
power of attorney.

25:10.070 --> 25:12.538
Power of attorney?
In case of incapacitation?

25:12.590 --> 25:13.898
Power of attorney now.

25:13.940 --> 25:16.067
Why?JACKIE: Howard...

25:16.120 --> 25:19.021
you're not in the same
shape you once were.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.980
I do the Jack LaLanne thing
every morning.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.553
I am ripped.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.646
I mean mentally.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.555
You're... declining.

25:25.610 --> 25:27.510
I'm sharper than
the serpent's tooth.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.118
LUCCA:
That's King Lear.

25:29.170 --> 25:31.479
And he lost his mind.It's from the first act,

25:31.530 --> 25:34.044
and Lear was still completely
in charge of his faculties.

25:34.090 --> 25:36.046
And what about the $2.2 million

25:36.090 --> 25:37.648
you just forgot about?

25:37.710 --> 25:39.871
People of sound mind
don't just forget

25:39.920 --> 25:42.002
about money like that.But...

25:42.060 --> 25:44.403
And if you can't face
the reality of your situation...

25:44.450 --> 25:45.838
I need the room.

25:45.890 --> 25:47.107
David...

25:47.150 --> 25:49.232
young ethnically
ambitious woman,

25:49.280 --> 25:51.669
I need a moment alone

25:51.720 --> 25:53.369
with my intended.

26:00.770 --> 26:02.203
[door closes]

26:02.250 --> 26:04.206
It's all a sham, baby.

26:04.250 --> 26:06.423
Howard...I didn't forget about the money.

26:06.470 --> 26:08.290
I never knewabout the money.

26:08.340 --> 26:11.036
The firm was trying to do
this thing to hide some cash,

26:11.090 --> 26:13.604
and I played along,
hoping they would

26:13.650 --> 26:16.562
cut me in-:
uh, cut... usm.

26:16.610 --> 26:18.749
This has all been
very taXIng.

26:18.790 --> 26:23.614
We _can resume these
discu55ions later.

26:23.660 --> 26:26.959
How'd it go?I think the storm
is setting in.

26:27.020 --> 26:31.013
He's not just losing his memory,
he's becoming delusional.

26:31.060 --> 26:32.584
That's what FEPA needs,

26:32.630 --> 26:34.188
and_that's what
we're gomg to give them.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.969
An apology.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.762
We're too far down
the rabbit hole
for anything else.

26:38.810 --> 26:40.061
Who do you have in mind?

26:40.120 --> 26:41.417
You.

26:41.460 --> 26:44.111
No way.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.151
You saw the video.

26:46.210 --> 26:48.166
Howard Lyman was
the worst offender.

26:48.210 --> 26:51.555
Cary, you blatantly stated
that Lockhart/Agos/Lee

26:51.610 --> 26:54.477
doesn't employ
African-Americans
in every p05ition.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.431
And you made it seem
like a badge of honor.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.254
That is not what I meant.That doesn't matter.

26:58.310 --> 27:00.346
You need to do it for the firm.

27:00.400 --> 27:03.824
The firm with yourname.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.916
Hurry! Caucus starts
in three minutes.

27:05.970 --> 27:07.926
This is
the bellwether precinct.

27:07.970 --> 27:10.097
We need this one
to go our way.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.141
But, Ruth,
how bad was Dad's...?

27:12.190 --> 27:13.703
Loose meat incident?

27:13.760 --> 27:16.058
The goodwill we generated
with the "Full Grassley"

27:16.110 --> 27:18.578
might have dissipated.That just sounds
so wrong.

27:18.630 --> 27:20.018
But Iowans are saw voters.

27:20.070 --> 27:21.719
If we lost some votes,

27:21.770 --> 27:24.546
this is our shot
to get them back-- right here

27:24.590 --> 27:27.548
on the caucus floor.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.854
GRACE: Oh, wow. I did not
expect it to be this crazy.

27:30.910 --> 27:33.595
Unlike the GOP,
Democrats don't do

27:33.650 --> 27:34.867
secret ballots.

27:34.910 --> 27:36.161
This is old-style

27:36.210 --> 27:37.859
Athenian democracy.

27:37.910 --> 27:40.435
A what?Athenian democracy.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.254
Literally,
a gathering of neighbors

27:42.310 --> 27:44.915
trying to convince each other
to support their candidate.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.689
Every candidate has a corner.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.308
Okay, that's Hillary's corner.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.703
PEOPLE [chanting]:
Hillary! Hillary!

27:50.750 --> 27:52.832
And there's Bernie's.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.314
[chanting]: There's no debate.
Bernie's great, great, great!

27:55.360 --> 27:57.499
Eh, oh, and those are
the people for O'Malley.

27:57.540 --> 28:01.067
[chanting]: Martin O'Malley!
Martin! O'Malley!

28:01.110 --> 28:02.714
Where's Dad's corner?

28:02.760 --> 28:04.102
Oh, there it is.

28:06.070 --> 28:08.504
RUTH:
Oh... my... God.

28:11.030 --> 28:12.941
GRACE: Where is everybody?

28:12.990 --> 28:15.333
RUTH: There are supposed
to be 30 people here.

28:15.380 --> 28:18.076
How do you know
there were supposed to be 30?

28:18.130 --> 28:19.472
We had promises
from people.

28:19.520 --> 28:20.771
Well, what do we do now?

28:20.820 --> 28:22.424
Peter can't be on the floor,
but you can.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.732
You've got to convince
people to vote for him.How?

28:24.790 --> 28:27.088
You can't approach
caucus-goers directly.

28:27.140 --> 28:29.040
What? Why not?You're not registered
Iowa voters.

28:29.090 --> 28:32.002
How do we convince people
to vote for Dad if we
can't approach them?

28:32.050 --> 28:33.267
You get them
to come to you.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.571
Who are you phoning?The cavalry.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.406
How-how do we get them
to come to us?

28:36.450 --> 28:37.838
You've been
all over the local news.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.278
You make yourself visible,

28:39.320 --> 28:41.709
people will come to you--
and when they do,

28:41.760 --> 28:43.751
you talk about
how much Peter lovesIowa

28:43.800 --> 28:45.449
and everything it stands for.

28:45.500 --> 28:46.671
Josh, what are you doing?

28:46.720 --> 28:48.415
Poll numbers.
How's it gomg?

28:48.460 --> 28:50.678
ALICIA: Disaster.What do you mean?

28:50.720 --> 28:52.802
There's no one here.
No one for Peter.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.760
We need 30 people in 30 minutes

28:54.820 --> 28:56.981
to stand under his sign,
or he's out.

28:57.030 --> 28:58.588
Are you kidding me?
Where are the local workers?

28:58.640 --> 28:59.641
Where's the volunteers?

28:59.690 --> 29:00.725
ALICIA:
Uh, Josh, Josh...

29:00.780 --> 29:03.908
less anger, more action.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.089
Where are you going?I'll be right here
circulating.

29:06.130 --> 29:08.382
Just remember the number 29.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.432
We need 29 supporters
in our group when
they call the vote

29:11.480 --> 29:12.560
if we want to stay in the game.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.394
[buzzer sounds]

29:16.140 --> 29:17.653
Now, go!
We have half an hour.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.188
29 people.

29:21.230 --> 29:22.185
Yeah.

29:22.230 --> 29:24.186
We can do this!

29:24.240 --> 29:26.970
It's not about the
sandwiches, it's about
doing unpleasant things.

29:27.020 --> 29:28.885
Yes...Every other candidate
showed up and did it--

29:28.940 --> 29:31.022
just ate those sandwiches,
and didn't go

29:31.070 --> 29:32.890
spitting it out, and
that tells you something.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.805
H can just...It makes you
think, maybe

29:34.860 --> 29:37.328
he doesn't have the stomach
for the job.

29:37.380 --> 29:39.553
ALICIA: I don't think he...Being able to handle
what's being given to you

29:39.600 --> 29:41.249
is a big part of...

29:41.300 --> 29:42.426
Hey. You go?

29:42.470 --> 29:44.597
Uh, next year.
I got early acceptance.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.993
Congrats. Yeah.
I'm there, too.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.689
Oh.A freshman. Yeah,
you're gonna love it.

29:48.740 --> 29:50.605
It's a great school.

29:50.650 --> 29:52.561
I can tell you're
really smart.

29:52.610 --> 29:54.521
Oh, is that right?Which is why
I'm wondering

29:54.570 --> 29:57.357
why you're voting for
this guy and not my dad.

29:57.400 --> 29:58.913
You're Zach Florrick?

29:59.970 --> 30:01.744
Your sister is Grace, right?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.574
Uh, yeah.

30:03.620 --> 30:05.702
Look, my dad accepted
Jesus Christ ﬁve years ago,

30:05.760 --> 30:08.923
and he is trying to bring
Christian stewardship
into his office.

30:08.980 --> 30:10.584
I'm from Iowa.

30:10.630 --> 30:12.621
I went to Roosevelt High School
in Des Moines,

30:12.680 --> 30:14.454
and I wouldn't be here

30:14.500 --> 30:16.673
if I didn't believe
in Governor Florrick.

30:16.720 --> 30:17.709
WOMAN:
Look at Obama with health care.

30:17.770 --> 30:19.544
That was an unpleasant thing.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.545
But he did it.
If Hillary...Edna,

30:21.600 --> 30:22.988
we appreciate
your insights,

30:23.030 --> 30:25.590
but if you don't mind,
I think we'd all like to hear

30:25.640 --> 30:27.255
what Mrs. Florrick has to say.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.597
I'm not stopping her.

30:28.650 --> 30:31.608
I could make a laundry list
of all the hard things

30:31.650 --> 30:33.868
my husband's done,
but I'll just say...

30:33.910 --> 30:35.992
that when he's faced

30:36.050 --> 30:38.177
with any tough decisions, my
husband always asks himself

30:38.220 --> 30:42.782
one question: will this
make a positive impact

30:42.840 --> 30:43.829
[buzzer sounds]on people's lives.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.484

conversations]

30:55.110 --> 30:56.805
28-- ah!

30:56.850 --> 30:58.021
we're short one.

30:58.070 --> 31:00.322
We just need one person.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.154
Just... one.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.758
Someone call someone.
Come on!

31:05.340 --> 31:07.331
Come on, Sam.
Your candidate

31:07.380 --> 31:08.688
doesn't need you-- we do.

31:08.730 --> 31:10.948
And we got pretty signs.We have pretty signs.

31:10.990 --> 31:13.129
Pretty blue-- just...
come on over here.

31:13.170 --> 31:14.899
I can get you a signed photo.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.212
[laughs]

31:22.750 --> 31:24.081
Tell her to come over.

31:24.140 --> 31:26.916
If she doesn't come for you,
she won't for me.

31:26.970 --> 31:28.870
She likes you.

31:30.100 --> 31:32.796
Me?

31:35.890 --> 31:37.755
Hey! I'm Grace.

31:38.850 --> 31:40.545
Sam.

31:40.590 --> 31:42.979
Hey, come on-- I've got
an extra sign for you over here.

31:43.030 --> 31:45.715
I have one over here, too.
You come here.

31:45.770 --> 31:47.806
I'm sorry, I can't.

31:47.860 --> 31:49.816
But it was
really nice meeting you.

31:54.860 --> 32:00.435
[group jeering, booing]

We need Florrick!

32:02.090 --> 32:04.911
29. We got it.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.302
We're viable!

32:06.350 --> 32:08.659

We need Florrick!

32:08.700 --> 32:11.043
We need Florrick!
We need Florrick!

32:11.100 --> 32:12.749
We need Florrick!

32:12.800 --> 32:14.222
We need Florrick!

32:14.280 --> 32:15.838
Hi, Jason?
I'm still in the prenup.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.835
Do you think
you can find anything

32:17.890 --> 32:20.529
on the provenance
of Howard's shell company?

32:20.590 --> 32:22.660
Um, I'm having trouble
hearing you.[bell clanging]

32:22.720 --> 32:24.108
Is it my phone or yours?

32:24.150 --> 32:25.287
I'm in San Francisco.

32:25.330 --> 32:27.104
Reception can't get any clearer.

32:27.160 --> 32:30.539
Alicia didn't say anything
about you being in California.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.852
Is everything all right
with you two?

32:32.900 --> 32:33.855
[clanging fades]

32:33.900 --> 32:35.333
Yeah. I took a job.
She knows.

32:35.380 --> 32:36.335
Oh!

32:36.380 --> 32:37.722
Well, if I'd known you were

32:37.780 --> 32:38.724
out of state,
I wouldn't have called.

32:38.780 --> 32:40.554
No, I can still take care of it.

32:40.610 --> 32:42.680
Multitasking is
all the rage out here.

32:42.740 --> 32:44.514
Good. Well,
whatever you can find.

32:44.570 --> 32:46.868
We're mid-battle, and I think
there's something suspicious.

32:46.920 --> 32:49.218
Thanks. Bye.

32:49.270 --> 32:51.079
CREECH:
It seems quite clear

32:51.140 --> 32:53.870
that Lockhart/Agos/Lee

32:53.920 --> 32:57.356
has in fact fostered
a must culture.

32:57.410 --> 32:58.707
I was afraid you'd say that,

32:58.750 --> 33:00.012
but...

33:00.060 --> 33:01.573
frankly, I don't disagree.

33:01.630 --> 33:04.019
DIANE: Well, your
investigation has forced some

33:04.060 --> 33:05.846
unstinting self reflection.

33:05.890 --> 33:07.539
CARY: Things like this,
things that are so embedded

33:07.590 --> 33:08.750
in the corporate culture,

33:08.810 --> 33:10.892
they... they don't
happen overnight.

33:11.810 --> 33:13.539
In our case, it was handed down

33:13.600 --> 33:15.807
by a longstanding senior partner
named Howard Lyman,

33:15.860 --> 33:17.202
you may recall him from

33:17.250 --> 33:19.036
Ms. Timmons' undercover tape.Uh...

33:19.080 --> 33:20.945
Mm.Cary, why don't
we discuss this?

33:20.990 --> 33:22.685
I just want to tell her
about her position.

33:22.730 --> 33:23.901
We've decided
to invite Howard

33:23.950 --> 33:25.167
to take emeritus status.

33:25.220 --> 33:26.699
This will limit
his voting rights

33:26.740 --> 33:28.992
and his contact
with the associates.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.733
Would that be a satisfactory
remedy for your agency?

33:30.790 --> 33:32.041
Yes.

33:32.090 --> 33:33.785
Yes, I think it would.

33:33.830 --> 33:34.910
Consider it done, then.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.830
You used the FEPA complaint

33:39.880 --> 33:41.575
to get what you wanted
all along.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.019
No.

33:43.060 --> 33:45.278
I did what needed to be
done to save the firm.

33:50.330 --> 33:51.809
27, 28-- you're one short.

33:51.850 --> 33:52.805
No, we're not.
What happened?

33:52.850 --> 33:53.839
Sorry, Ruth, you're not viable.

33:53.900 --> 33:56.721
Wait, we had 29.
What happened?

33:56.770 --> 33:59.022
It's the youth minister.
She's gone.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.901
I'm not giving you additional
time to find your lost sheep.

34:08.220 --> 34:09.289
Even a youth minister has
to powder her nose.

34:09.350 --> 34:10.294
No.

34:10.350 --> 34:12.215
I have worked six caucuses,

34:12.260 --> 34:14.728
and never once seen a precinct
chair reject a request

34:14.790 --> 34:16.917
for a reasonable
accommodation on time.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.302
Letter of the law,
spirit of it, too.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.043
ALICIA: Sir, your denial
of our request

34:20.100 --> 34:21.488
violates procedural
due process.

34:21.530 --> 34:23.179
I may not be a high-priced
lawyer, Mrs. Florrick,

34:23.230 --> 34:25.357
but I know the rules:
no extra time.

34:27.230 --> 34:29.881
Mr. Peltola?

34:29.930 --> 34:32.535
Pursuant to Rule 73,
a precinct chair must certify

34:32.590 --> 34:34.319
all votes cast

34:34.370 --> 34:36.895
and the number of voters
registered at the precmct.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.248
I know the rules.If a voter is missing,

34:38.290 --> 34:39.848
it is encuincumbentmbent upon
you

34:39.900 --> 34:41.117
to find out whether
or not the voter has,

34:41.160 --> 34:42.639
in fact, left the premises.

34:42.680 --> 34:44.944
First Ruth tells me
she's powdering her nose,

34:44.990 --> 34:46.423
now you tell me Elvis
left the building.

34:46.470 --> 34:48.290
No, I checked the ladies' room.
She's not there.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.516
Listen up, everybody!

34:51.560 --> 34:53.118
We're adding
five additional minutes

34:53.170 --> 34:55.434
to the vote to locate a voter.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.380
[all groaning, murmuring]

34:59.310 --> 35:00.299
Nice job, ladies.

35:00.350 --> 35:02.398
Let's just find that minister.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.396
Yeah, Jason, what do you got?

35:04.450 --> 35:06.748
Ugh. Enough antioxidants

35:06.800 --> 35:09.405
running through my system
to ensure that I never die.

35:09.450 --> 35:11.577
Where are you?You don't want to know.

35:11.630 --> 35:14.758
I followed the paper trail
on the whole Howard thing.That was fast.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.542
I found out who moved the money.
It wasn't Howard.

35:17.590 --> 35:19.546
Who was it?

35:19.590 --> 35:20.978
David Lee.

35:21.030 --> 35:23.191
Makes sense.

35:23.250 --> 35:24.592
What's his angle?
Is he embezzling?

35:24.640 --> 35:26.369
No idea.

35:26.420 --> 35:28.888
Alicia probably has
a better sense of it than me.

35:28.950 --> 35:30.463
Okay.
I'll see if I can use this.

35:30.510 --> 35:33.331
And don't become
a stranger, okay?

35:33.390 --> 35:36.086
Hey, never, Lucca.
You know me.

35:36.130 --> 35:37.347
That's what I mean.

35:37.390 --> 35:39.563
I do know you.
And I like Alicia.

35:39.610 --> 35:41.828
Ouch. What'd I do?

35:41.870 --> 35:43.178
What you always do.

35:43.220 --> 35:44.653
Flirt with everyone.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.224

35:46.270 --> 35:48.135
All right, can I go now, Mom?

35:48.180 --> 35:49.829
Behave. Please.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.405
Always.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.099
I found her--
the youth minister.

35:54.150 --> 35:56.402
Oh, thank God.
Where is she?

35:56.450 --> 35:58.099
She joined
the Hillary supporters.What?!

35:58.150 --> 35:59.230

other candidates. He has to be.

it's Governor Peter Florrick.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.396

37:14.440 --> 37:16.260
That's quite an upset
for Hillary.

Oh, 123 votes,
Governor.

37:18.450 --> 37:19.530
Congratulations.

37:19.580 --> 37:21.445
That's
a 79-vote margin--

37:21.500 --> 37:22.751
in this bellwether precinct
that counts

37:22.800 --> 37:23.926
as an order of magnitude.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.277
Ruth, I'm a convert.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.490
I don't know
what you did in there!

37:26.540 --> 37:27.711
It was a group effort.

37:27.760 --> 37:28.840
Well, keep on paving the way

37:28.890 --> 37:30.152
to the Promised Land.

37:30.200 --> 37:31.189
Doing my best, sir.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.764
This next precinct
is pivotal.

37:32.810 --> 37:34.801
One second.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.632
Hillary won't be pleased.[scoffing laugh]

37:39.690 --> 37:42.329
It's one precinct.
We got a very long way to go.

37:42.390 --> 37:45.348
Listen, as long as I have
you here, I have to ask.

37:45.390 --> 37:48.382
That argument you had with
Eli-- what was it about?

37:50.480 --> 37:52.914
I think you'd prefer
not to know.

37:52.960 --> 37:56.691
Well, is there something
going on between you and Eli?

37:57.750 --> 37:59.832
It's about the past.

38:04.490 --> 38:08.449
RUTH:
Sorry to interrupt, folks.
Moment of truth time.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.580
The networks
are about to announce

38:09.630 --> 38:11.450

of the caucus.

38:40.180 --> 38:43.229
And for third place,
Martin O'Malley.

38:44.450 --> 38:46.133
It looks like all
the candidates finished

38:46.190 --> 38:49.148
pretty much as predicted.
The big surprise, though,

38:49.190 --> 38:51.238
is Peter Florrick,
from neighboring Illinois.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.271
He finished a distant fourth.

38:53.330 --> 38:56.231
A very distant fourth.

38:56.290 --> 38:59.589
Florrick won a meager four
out of 99 counties:

38:59.640 --> 39:02.336
Polk and the three
he visited yesterday.

39:02.380 --> 39:04.894
It looks like his Full Grassley
wasn't full enough.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.385
Florrick won a meager four
of 99 counties--

39:12.430 --> 39:15.126
Polk and the three
he visited yesterday.

39:15.170 --> 39:18.469
It looks like his Full Grassley
wasn't full enough.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.475
[turns off TV]

39:20.530 --> 39:21.519
Jackie...

39:23.400 --> 39:24.389
I'm sorry.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.396
[sighs heavily]

39:26.450 --> 39:30.739
Do you know
what was invented in Iowa?

39:30.800 --> 39:32.529
No.

39:32.580 --> 39:36.402
Neither do I. Because Iowa
has contributed nothing

39:36.460 --> 39:38.451
to our union, and I don't
understand why a state

39:38.500 --> 39:41.492
so insignificant
gets the right

39:41.550 --> 39:45.759
to kick off
a presidential primary.

39:45.810 --> 39:49.428
Do you want to go home?

39:49.470 --> 39:50.812
No.

39:50.860 --> 39:53.909
I want to settle this tonight.

39:53.950 --> 39:56.942
Well, the $2.2 million
in Howard's account--

39:57.000 --> 39:58.956
it was put there by David Lee.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.991
Howard knew nothing about it.

40:03.870 --> 40:06.259
So Howard was telling the truth?

40:06.310 --> 40:07.789
Yes.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.445
And he isn't senile?

40:10.490 --> 40:13.448
He isn't.

40:13.490 --> 40:16.448
[sighs with relief]

40:16.500 --> 40:18.491
That is good news.

40:18.540 --> 40:19.973
Where are you going?

40:20.020 --> 40:22.011
To my fianc.

40:23.590 --> 40:25.455
Howard...

40:25.510 --> 40:28.240
I'm awake. I'm awake.

40:28.290 --> 40:30.508
[grunting]

40:30.550 --> 40:34.725
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
I should never have doubted you.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.941
[wry chuckle]
Everybody makes mistakes.

40:36.990 --> 40:40.869
Worst one of all:
doubting me.

40:40.910 --> 40:44.823
Let's just forget about
this silly prenup.

40:44.870 --> 40:46.735
You sure?

40:46.790 --> 40:49.566
It seemed your son was
pretty serious about it.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.396
He won't push it.
Not after tonight.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.395
What do you mean, tonight?

40:54.450 --> 40:56.577
He lost the presidency.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.315
Ooh.

40:58.360 --> 41:01.488
Sorry.

41:01.540 --> 41:05.067
So am I.

41:05.110 --> 41:08.546
[sighs contentedly]:
Mm.

41:08.590 --> 41:11.320
I hope we have
some time together.

41:11.380 --> 41:13.507
Mm. We will.

41:13.550 --> 41:16.599
Promise.

41:26.350 --> 41:28.341
You overreached.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.825
You sweet-talked Peter,

41:32.880 --> 41:35.440
convinced him
he could win the presidency.

41:35.490 --> 41:38.618
You attacked the frontrunner
and ended up alienating voters.

41:38.670 --> 41:41.184
I don't need the Monday morning
quarterbacking, Eli.

41:41.230 --> 41:43.221
I did exactly as you would have:

41:43.280 --> 41:46.272
followed the polling data...For any other candidate, yes.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.282
But not this one.

41:52.240 --> 41:55.414
You were with him
24/7 for months,

41:55.460 --> 41:57.200
and you missed
the most fundamental

41:57.250 --> 41:59.946
thing about the man.

41:59.990 --> 42:03.426
_ Peter Florrick
is not number one.

42:03.470 --> 42:06.337
Not nationally.

42:06.390 --> 42:07.903
She is.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.951
Yes, Eli, we all know

42:10.000 --> 42:12.787
Hillary Rodham Clinton
is a giant.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.821
No, not Hillary.

42:16.570 --> 42:17.912
Alicia.

42:20.660 --> 42:24.573
No one's more happy

42:24.620 --> 42:26.144
Than you

42:29.020 --> 42:33.013
Even the slq's

42:33.070 --> 42:35.368
Feeling blue

42:37.680 --> 42:41.332
And you don't believe

42:41.380 --> 42:43.553
But it's true

42:46.910 --> 42:48.946
No one's

42:49.000 --> 42:50.206
More happy

42:50.260 --> 42:52.080
Than you

42:54.830 --> 42:56.604
No one's

42:56.660 --> 42:59.003
More happy

42:59.050 --> 43:01.041
Than you

43:03.270 --> 43:05.056
No one's

43:05.100 --> 43:07.443
More happy

43:07.490 --> 43:09.094
Than you

43:11.800 --> 43:13.279
No one.
