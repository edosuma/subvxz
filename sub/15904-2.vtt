WEBVTT

00:19.910 --> 00:21.945
The five most truly
free moments of a human's life

00:21.979 --> 00:25.349
in ascending order--
leaving his parents' home,

00:25.383 --> 00:27.685
dumping a girl hard,

00:27.718 --> 00:29.219
deciding to eat
a whole pizza,

00:29.252 --> 00:30.721
hammocks...

00:30.754 --> 00:33.223
and finishing
a writing project.

00:33.256 --> 00:35.292
Jimmy, did you finish

00:35.325 --> 00:37.160
your book proposal?

00:37.194 --> 00:39.329
Your sarcasm

00:39.363 --> 00:41.331
is but an impotent
fusillade of arrows

00:41.365 --> 00:44.402
plinking off the Sherman tank
that is my relief.

00:44.435 --> 00:45.836
Nay, it is

00:45.869 --> 00:49.139
a Verdi aria to my brand-new
cochlear implants,

00:49.172 --> 00:51.875
for it means
'tis true I indeed

00:51.909 --> 00:53.711
finished my book proposal.

00:53.744 --> 00:56.514
Also I am exceedingly drunk
and cannot trust

00:56.547 --> 00:58.181
my grip on the truth.

00:58.215 --> 01:00.017
"Grip."
(chuckles)

01:00.050 --> 01:02.352
Oh...

01:03.754 --> 01:05.087
Um...

01:05.122 --> 01:06.557
Uh, sorry.

01:06.590 --> 01:07.925
I just need to grab my, um...

01:11.261 --> 01:13.196
(alarm beeping)
(groans)

01:16.600 --> 01:17.601
Oh, what are those?
Gimme.

01:17.635 --> 01:18.869
Uh, they're boring.

01:18.902 --> 01:20.037
I finally saw that
psychiatrist.

01:20.070 --> 01:21.439
He put me on these.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.674
He's making me see
this stupid therapist

01:23.707 --> 01:25.409
for the talky-talky.

01:25.443 --> 01:28.178
I always wondered, what
exactly is the difference

01:28.211 --> 01:29.447
between a psychiatrist
and a therapist?

01:29.480 --> 01:31.882
A psychiatrist is like,

01:31.915 --> 01:33.851
"Here, take this pills, ho."

01:33.884 --> 01:36.454
A therapist is all,
"Oh, tell me your shit.

01:36.487 --> 01:37.955
I couldn't make it
as an actor."

01:37.988 --> 01:39.022
I'm bored.

01:39.056 --> 01:40.924
Let's go to the bar.
Ugh.

01:40.958 --> 01:43.193
I have to go to that
stupid therapist.

01:43.226 --> 01:44.728
Don't worry,
it won't take long.

01:44.762 --> 01:46.730
I'll go in there,
she'll wave her magic wand,

01:46.764 --> 01:48.799
and boom,
Gretchen's 100.

01:48.832 --> 01:50.233
(gasps)
Oh, you're moving out.

01:50.267 --> 01:51.368
Thank God.

01:51.401 --> 01:52.402
Make sure you leave
your mattress

01:52.436 --> 01:53.471
on the curb
before you go.

01:53.504 --> 01:55.639
And spray paint
"unclean" on it,

01:55.673 --> 01:56.907
in Spanish.

01:56.940 --> 01:59.943
No, Dorothy found a place.

01:59.977 --> 02:01.645
Thanks for
letting me crash.

02:01.679 --> 02:03.781
I will leave a check
for all the stuff I broke.

02:03.814 --> 02:04.915
Kidding.

02:04.948 --> 02:06.450
(Jimmy sighs)

02:10.753 --> 02:12.155
Edgar, why in God's name

02:12.189 --> 02:13.390
haven't you been opening
the mail?

02:13.423 --> 02:14.658
You made mail Gretchen's,

02:14.692 --> 02:16.827
as you said,
"one little chore."

02:16.860 --> 02:19.096
Well, I already have
one little chore.

02:19.129 --> 02:20.631
Aw, Jimmy's dick-- ya burnt.

02:20.664 --> 02:22.232
No, he's right.

02:22.265 --> 02:24.101
"Gretchen opens the mail"
is on the chore list.

02:24.134 --> 02:26.570
Right under
"Jimmy takes out trash,

02:26.604 --> 02:28.672
i.e.: his own butt."

02:28.706 --> 02:31.609
Fine. I'll get to it.

02:31.642 --> 02:33.110
Never.

02:33.143 --> 02:34.745
Damn. Big day for burns.

02:34.778 --> 02:35.579
Ooh.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.781
Ugh.
Hey, um,

02:37.815 --> 02:39.349
I just wanted to say thank you

02:39.382 --> 02:40.918
for valuing my opinion.
I don't.

02:40.951 --> 02:41.985
Never have.

02:42.019 --> 02:43.487
Worse than a dog's opinion.

02:43.521 --> 02:44.522
What are you talking about?

02:44.555 --> 02:45.823
Your book proposal.

02:45.856 --> 02:47.324
First of all,

02:47.357 --> 02:48.926
it's a really great start.

02:48.959 --> 02:51.028
I love the world.

02:51.061 --> 02:54.097
But I thought I'd do
the 10,000-feet notes first,

02:54.131 --> 02:55.833
and then we'd go page by page,
hmm?

02:55.866 --> 02:59.670
Hmm. How about you literally
throw them in the trash?

02:59.703 --> 03:01.138
The proposal went out already.

03:01.171 --> 03:02.372
Well, then, why did you
have me read it?

03:02.405 --> 03:03.641
Because I wanted you to go,

03:03.674 --> 03:05.509
"Wow, you're so smart, Jimmy.

03:05.543 --> 03:08.145
I could never do that;
I'm a stupid baby."

03:08.178 --> 03:09.547
(paper rustling)

03:20.490 --> 03:23.293
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

03:23.326 --> 03:26.029
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

03:26.063 --> 03:29.366
* Gonna leave you anyway.

03:33.336 --> 03:34.805
I understand your frustrations,

03:34.838 --> 03:36.740
but sometimes
hearing others' opinions can,

03:36.774 --> 03:39.810
at worst, make us feel more
confident in our decisions.

03:39.843 --> 03:41.244
Wow.

03:41.278 --> 03:44.514
For a therapist,
you are a wretched listener.

03:44.548 --> 03:46.149
I didn't ask him for notes,

03:46.183 --> 03:48.518
because one, my proposal
went out already,

03:48.552 --> 03:49.853
though I've heard nothing,

03:49.887 --> 03:51.521
which is potentially worrisome.

03:51.555 --> 03:54.524
And two, I don't even know
for sure that he can read,

03:54.558 --> 03:57.360
let alone comprehend
the sui generis,

03:57.394 --> 04:00.197
unabashedly erotic,
multigenerational,

04:00.230 --> 04:01.932
literary family epic.

04:01.965 --> 04:04.234
Gretchen,
you said you wanted Jimmy here

04:04.267 --> 04:06.503
because he can help tell
the story of your depression.

04:06.536 --> 04:08.105
Sorry, what?

04:08.138 --> 04:09.573
Can you tell me why you're here?

04:10.941 --> 04:12.509
No. Can you?

04:12.542 --> 04:14.011
I thought the happy pills
were supposed to fix me.

04:14.044 --> 04:15.112
He had notes.

04:15.145 --> 04:16.379
What notes?

04:16.413 --> 04:18.115
The proposal is perfect.

04:18.148 --> 04:20.718
Talk therapy
along with medication

04:20.750 --> 04:22.419
is the most effective
long-term approach

04:22.452 --> 04:23.553
to managing depression.

04:23.587 --> 04:24.722
You mean, beating depression.

04:24.755 --> 04:26.223
Winning depression.
Oh, I like that.

04:26.256 --> 04:28.091
That's not a thing.
Winning it.

04:28.125 --> 04:29.860
Let's start here.

04:29.893 --> 04:33.230
Name one small thing
you've been avoiding.

04:33.263 --> 04:35.699
I already did one small
thing this morning.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.567
Aw, rough day
for Jimmy's dick.

04:38.669 --> 04:39.870
So, we done?

04:39.903 --> 04:40.904
THERAPIST:
We can be done,

04:40.938 --> 04:43.273
or you can do the next thing.

04:43.306 --> 04:45.042
Self-improvement
is a lifelong process.

04:45.075 --> 04:47.377
How is this a
real profession?

04:47.410 --> 04:49.279
This feels
like a scam.
It's not a scam.

04:49.312 --> 04:50.948
I calls 'em
like I sees 'em.

04:50.981 --> 04:52.282
JIMMY:
I still don't understand

04:52.315 --> 04:53.550
why my issues are unimportant

04:53.583 --> 04:54.584
to you people.

04:54.618 --> 04:56.453
I want you to make a to-do list,

04:56.486 --> 04:58.588
but with just one thing on it
at a time.

04:58.622 --> 05:00.257
I don't have anything
I need to do.

05:03.794 --> 05:05.663
You want to fight?

05:05.696 --> 05:08.331
Oh, are you trying
to fight me?

05:08.365 --> 05:09.633
'Cause we can go.

05:14.537 --> 05:16.006
Can't you just assign me
the one thing?

05:16.039 --> 05:17.140
Oh, I will.

05:17.174 --> 05:18.241
Launder your clothes.

05:18.275 --> 05:19.943
Don't wear your shoes
to bed.

05:19.977 --> 05:21.478
Stop giving Killian food.

05:21.511 --> 05:23.981
Titty massages for Jimmy.

05:24.014 --> 05:25.749
That's when the girl runs
her dangling titties

05:25.783 --> 05:26.917
up and down your body.

05:26.950 --> 05:28.085
It's quite nice.

05:28.118 --> 05:29.486
Wash your legs.

05:29.519 --> 05:30.854
What?
I don't wash my legs.

05:32.322 --> 05:33.456
Okay. Fine.

05:33.490 --> 05:34.524
Mail.

05:34.557 --> 05:35.592
There is a stack of mail

05:35.625 --> 05:36.760
that I have been avoiding.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.528
Why?
They always want money,

05:38.561 --> 05:40.130
or you have jury duty,

05:40.163 --> 05:42.332
or your grandma sent you a check
for your birthday,

05:42.365 --> 05:44.167
and then you feel guilty
that you never call her,

05:44.201 --> 05:46.136
and then you can't get
out of bed for a month.

05:49.506 --> 05:51.608
Anyway... mail.

05:51.641 --> 05:53.276
Does that count
for your stupid-ass...?

05:53.310 --> 05:54.511
Ugh, sorry.

05:54.544 --> 05:56.646
It's all right,
I'm a professional.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.848
You can say anything you want
in here.

05:57.881 --> 05:59.883
Hmm.

06:01.418 --> 06:02.953
Anything?

06:02.986 --> 06:04.154
Really?

06:04.187 --> 06:06.123
Does opening
the mail count

06:06.156 --> 06:07.891
for your one little
asshole thing,

06:07.925 --> 06:09.459
you goddamn cock?

06:09.492 --> 06:11.228
You suck-balls
dumb dick?

06:11.261 --> 06:12.796
Sure.
Fine,

06:12.830 --> 06:14.631
jizz-magnet.

06:14.664 --> 06:16.566
I will open
one piece of mail.

06:16.599 --> 06:17.567
Say "whore."

06:17.600 --> 06:19.136
Whore.
Whore.

06:19.169 --> 06:21.071
I'm regretting giving you
license to say anything.

06:21.104 --> 06:22.305
Plus I do kind of want

06:22.339 --> 06:23.640
to fight you right now.
Too late.

06:23.673 --> 06:25.008
No take-backsies.

06:27.344 --> 06:29.179
Titty-sucking bitch.

06:30.513 --> 06:31.749
PAUL (whining):
Ow.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.984
Lindsay, it hurts.

06:34.017 --> 06:35.152
I know.

06:35.185 --> 06:36.653
It'll be over soon.

06:36.686 --> 06:38.355
(groans)
Well,

06:38.388 --> 06:41.358
it's not often I get
to fill your holes, huh?

06:41.391 --> 06:43.226
(chuckles)
(grunts)

06:43.260 --> 06:45.228
Oh, I'm falling
so far behind

06:45.262 --> 06:46.696
on my big year.

06:46.730 --> 06:48.431
Rhett Gherkins has spotted

06:48.465 --> 06:50.200
a paint-billed crake,
Lindsay.

06:50.233 --> 06:52.335
A paint-billed crake!
I know,

06:52.369 --> 06:53.837
but his wife has no tits

06:53.871 --> 06:55.438
and looks like a Gila monster.

06:55.472 --> 06:56.774
(laughing)

06:56.807 --> 06:58.408
(groaning):
Ow.

06:58.441 --> 06:59.576
No, don't make me laugh.

06:59.609 --> 07:00.844
Ow!

07:00.878 --> 07:02.880
(whimpering):
I'm sorry.

07:02.913 --> 07:04.247
I'm so annoying.

07:04.281 --> 07:05.615
You're fine, bear.

07:05.648 --> 07:07.017
I'm a terrible patient.

07:07.050 --> 07:08.218
When I had the mumps,

07:08.251 --> 07:09.386
Mother threatened to send me

07:09.419 --> 07:10.520
to foster care.

07:10.553 --> 07:12.522
Pill time, hmm?

07:12.555 --> 07:14.958
And wash it down
with this.

07:16.259 --> 07:18.095
This is so much medicine.

07:18.128 --> 07:20.030
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have backed into my knife.

07:20.063 --> 07:21.865
(gagging):
It's just like me

07:21.899 --> 07:23.266
to go backing into things.

07:23.300 --> 07:26.636
I crawled in reverse
until I was two.

07:26.669 --> 07:28.972
(crying):
I'm so stupid.

07:30.340 --> 07:32.575
I'd better go refill
these again.

07:32.609 --> 07:34.577
Credit card, please?

07:34.611 --> 07:37.580
I don't remember
taking all that.

07:38.982 --> 07:41.251
You keep taking extra
and you don't remember it.

07:41.284 --> 07:43.086
(sighs)

07:43.120 --> 07:44.387
(crying)
Bye, now.

07:44.421 --> 07:46.990
(whining):
Please hurry back.

07:51.929 --> 07:52.963
(groans)

08:01.839 --> 08:03.807
This is on Paul, right?
Yes.

08:03.841 --> 08:06.910
What a poor
little patient he is.

08:06.944 --> 08:09.246
I was so caught up
preparing the mise en place,

08:09.279 --> 08:10.247
I didn't see him.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.748
He ran right
into my knife.

08:11.781 --> 08:14.217
I didn't even push that deep.

08:16.119 --> 08:17.354
Lindsay.

08:17.387 --> 08:18.355
How are your pancakes?

08:18.388 --> 08:20.490
Are you saying that you,
on purpose,

08:20.523 --> 08:22.826
like murderer-style,
stabbed Paul?
No.

08:22.860 --> 08:24.027
What? No.

08:24.061 --> 08:25.028
I loved him.

08:25.062 --> 08:25.996
Love?

08:26.029 --> 08:27.030
Right.

08:27.064 --> 08:28.966
He's my current husband.

08:28.999 --> 08:31.034
I love him now.
I do.

08:31.068 --> 08:33.669
Now I'm wishing
I got the pancakes.

08:35.804 --> 08:38.842
I can't believe that bitch
gave me homework.

08:38.876 --> 08:40.510
No, you fix me, dummy.

08:40.543 --> 08:42.445
You know what?

08:42.479 --> 08:44.481
I'm a goddamn A.F. adult.

08:44.514 --> 08:45.515
I quit.

08:45.548 --> 08:47.317
She can suck it.
(laughs)

08:47.350 --> 08:48.618
Fine. (clears throat)

08:48.651 --> 08:50.653
Since you won't let it go,

08:50.687 --> 08:52.122
tell me one
of your stupid notes.

08:52.155 --> 08:53.756
Okay.

08:56.526 --> 08:58.795
Ah, macro.

08:58.828 --> 09:01.631
Uh, was the sex supposed
to be erotic or disturbing?

09:01.664 --> 09:03.200
Both. Dumb note. Next.

09:03.233 --> 09:05.302
Yeah, I wasn't sure
the "randy, Bohemian aunt"

09:05.335 --> 09:06.536
made sense as a character.

09:06.569 --> 09:08.205
You don't make sense
as a character.

09:08.238 --> 09:10.340
Very one-note. Next.

09:10.373 --> 09:12.809
Why do Kitty and Simon
install a two-way mirror?

09:12.842 --> 09:13.643
Right, give me those.

09:13.676 --> 09:15.578
Okay.

09:15.612 --> 09:18.515
Actually, I have to move Dorothy
into her new apartment today

09:18.548 --> 09:20.918
and... I could use some help.

09:24.554 --> 09:25.923
I'll come.

09:25.956 --> 09:26.924
Oh, thanks, Jimmy.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.225
I've been a little rocky lately,

09:28.258 --> 09:29.426
and I could really
use the support.

09:29.459 --> 09:30.427
Oh, I'm not helping.

09:30.460 --> 09:31.861
I'm coming so that I can

09:31.895 --> 09:33.163
eviscerate your notes,

09:33.196 --> 09:36.499
one by one, to show you
how dumb you are.

09:36.533 --> 09:38.035
Oh, and if you must know,

09:38.068 --> 09:40.237
they install the mirror
because they're siblings.

09:40.270 --> 09:42.372
So, obviously, they can't
partake in each other's

09:42.405 --> 09:45.075
tight, little bodies,
but this way, at least,

09:45.108 --> 09:48.778
they can observe each other's
erotic dalliances.

09:48.811 --> 09:51.381
Duh.

09:53.816 --> 09:55.285
I just want you to know

09:55.318 --> 09:57.087
I am not coming back!
First of all...

09:57.120 --> 09:58.421
I am with a patient.

09:58.455 --> 10:00.323
Wait, what?

10:01.391 --> 10:02.759
No, I'm angry!

10:02.792 --> 10:03.793
Get out.

10:12.769 --> 10:15.105
I'm so sorry.

10:19.109 --> 10:21.144
DOROTHY:
So, last night,

10:21.178 --> 10:23.646
guess your body adjusted
to the new pills, after all.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.115
Yeah, guess so.

10:25.148 --> 10:26.583
Good, because that
whole thing that I said

10:26.616 --> 10:27.917
about non-penetrative sex,

10:27.951 --> 10:29.452
check, please.

10:29.486 --> 10:32.255
So, the apartment
could be cute, right?

10:32.289 --> 10:33.890
If I pick up some

10:33.923 --> 10:35.725
extra Chore Monkey shifts
to buy a couch,

10:35.758 --> 10:37.460
and figure out how
to hide those weird pipes.

10:37.494 --> 10:38.895
The baby handprints
on the ceiling

10:38.928 --> 10:39.963
are a little
disconcerting,

10:39.997 --> 10:42.899
but you can't
see them at night.

10:42.932 --> 10:44.101
Edgar?

10:44.134 --> 10:45.668
Have you noticed how many more

10:45.702 --> 10:47.137
tent cities there are lately?

10:47.170 --> 10:49.172
Do you know
any of them?

10:49.206 --> 10:52.275
Any ex-hobo girlfriends
that I need to beat up?

10:52.309 --> 10:54.477
Sorry, bad time for comedy?

10:54.511 --> 10:56.813
No, it's-it's fine.

10:56.846 --> 10:58.982
No, I'm sorry.

10:59.016 --> 11:00.750
This is your big day.

11:00.783 --> 11:02.319
Yeah!

11:02.352 --> 11:05.955
I am moving into a beautiful
studio in WeHoCa.

11:05.989 --> 11:08.258
That's L.A.'s newest,
hip neighborhood:

11:08.291 --> 11:10.160
West of Homeless Encampment.

11:10.193 --> 11:11.628
Hey.

11:11.661 --> 11:13.130
I think it could
be so cute.

11:13.163 --> 11:14.764
Right? I think so.

11:14.797 --> 11:16.466
Thanks.
I mean...

11:16.499 --> 11:19.502
it's obviously
an idiotic note,

11:19.536 --> 11:22.605
but, gun to my head,
I could show the origin

11:22.639 --> 11:24.174
of Malcolm and Sally's
erotic coupling.

11:24.207 --> 11:25.942
Well, if I did that,

11:25.975 --> 11:29.946
then I'd be introducing a
soupçon of narrative Anschauung,

11:29.979 --> 11:33.016
which would allow me to get
inside Clementine's head

11:33.050 --> 11:35.385
when she allows the punk rock
bassist she's just met

11:35.418 --> 11:36.519
urinate on her britches.

11:38.221 --> 11:39.989
This is so stupid.

11:43.860 --> 11:46.229
(classical music playing)

12:00.943 --> 12:02.345
(classical music stops playing)

12:02.379 --> 12:03.980
Okay.

12:04.013 --> 12:05.182
How can I help you, Gretchen?

12:05.215 --> 12:07.184
Nice magazines.

12:07.217 --> 12:09.686
So boring, I almost died
rather than read them.

12:09.719 --> 12:12.489
You obviously want very badly
for me to understand something.

12:12.522 --> 12:15.492
You told me there were things
I could do, insinuating that

12:15.525 --> 12:17.194
I could have fixed myself
any time I wanted,

12:17.227 --> 12:19.162
and that is
negating my story.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.663
It is tired.

12:20.697 --> 12:23.333
It is patriarchal,
and it is rape culture-y.

12:23.366 --> 12:26.203
You are basically
a rape apologist.

12:26.236 --> 12:28.405
I don't believe you don't
believe therapy can help.

12:28.438 --> 12:31.908
Why don't you don't tell me more
about how I don't feel?

12:31.941 --> 12:33.610
You really want to quit?
Yes.

12:33.643 --> 12:35.612
Okay, then.

12:35.645 --> 12:37.013
It was nice to have met you.

12:37.046 --> 12:39.282
You are memorable.

12:39.316 --> 12:43.186
You know... I'm proud of you for
standing up for what you want.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.221
(chuckles lightly)

12:44.254 --> 12:45.455
Who are you, my mom?

12:45.488 --> 12:46.689
Joke's on you.

12:46.723 --> 12:47.924
My mom would never say that.

12:47.957 --> 12:49.058
I know you're not my mommy.

12:49.092 --> 12:50.227
Like, what if I started

12:50.260 --> 12:52.061
calling you "Mommy"?

12:52.095 --> 12:55.232
(chuckling):
How weird would that be?

12:55.265 --> 12:57.066
I'm gonna go in now.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.136
Good luck, Gretchen.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.338
(whispering):
Bitch.

13:09.078 --> 13:10.613
I really like
the adjustments.

13:10.647 --> 13:13.082
Well, your asinine notes
started a thought process

13:13.116 --> 13:15.051
of actual, usable fixes.

13:15.084 --> 13:17.254
I had to cut the scene
in the cockpit of the plane

13:17.287 --> 13:18.888
where Joachim Kirschner
masturbates

13:18.921 --> 13:20.923
during his bombing
run on London,

13:20.957 --> 13:22.625
but the section
is still highly erotic.

13:22.659 --> 13:24.761
Did you take out the thing
with Roger spanking his nephew?

13:24.794 --> 13:27.464
What, you let Dorothy read it?!

13:27.497 --> 13:29.466
I thought the sample
chapters were great...

13:29.499 --> 13:30.500
Thank you.

13:30.533 --> 13:32.068
It's so nice to hear from fans.

13:32.101 --> 13:34.337
...just potentially
very alienating to women.

13:35.372 --> 13:37.507
This is literature, okay?

13:37.540 --> 13:39.342
It shall sing its own song,

13:39.376 --> 13:42.479
uncaring if sensibilities
are too delicate.

13:42.512 --> 13:44.647
Anyway, it feels like
we keep forgetting

13:44.681 --> 13:46.082
the proposal's in already.

13:46.115 --> 13:47.083
It's done.

13:47.116 --> 13:48.351
Okay.

13:48.385 --> 13:50.487
Just so many descriptions

13:50.520 --> 13:52.955
of semen on stockings.

13:52.989 --> 13:55.592
Stockings are a sign
both of the deprivation

13:55.625 --> 13:58.461
of the Second World War
and how much the repressed

13:58.495 --> 14:02.432
Kitty's slutty little legs
wanted semen on them!

14:02.465 --> 14:04.967
What is alienating about that?

14:05.001 --> 14:06.669
(indistinct conversations)

14:06.703 --> 14:08.671
EDGAR:
Uh, hey.

14:08.705 --> 14:11.474
Uh... are people being
generous today?

14:11.508 --> 14:13.610
Man, I ain't got
jack shit yet today.

14:13.643 --> 14:16.145
Hmm, well, you know,
I was noticing that, um,

14:16.179 --> 14:17.514
y-your sign's
a little confusing.

14:17.547 --> 14:18.815
It looks like
you need money

14:18.848 --> 14:20.283
for dog food for yourself.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.185
No, I-I need money

14:22.219 --> 14:24.120
for my dog,
food, and beer.

14:24.153 --> 14:25.121
May I?

14:25.154 --> 14:27.524
Yeah, please.

14:31.394 --> 14:33.396
Oh, that is clearer.
Thanks, man.

14:33.430 --> 14:35.064
Yeah.
MAN:
How's mine?

14:36.499 --> 14:39.336
Between you and me,
civvies feel super guilty

14:39.369 --> 14:40.470
around us veterans,
so they've trained

14:40.503 --> 14:41.504
themselves to ignore us.

14:41.538 --> 14:43.373
So, um...

14:43.406 --> 14:44.741
uh, you know may-maybe

14:44.774 --> 14:45.742
write something
funny instead.

14:45.775 --> 14:47.176
Like what?

14:48.177 --> 14:49.412
Well, can I get a...

14:49.446 --> 14:51.147
like, a suggestion

14:51.180 --> 14:53.149
of a topic
from one of you guys?

14:53.182 --> 14:54.150
You know, something light.

14:54.183 --> 14:56.553
Cookies.
Demon rape.

14:56.586 --> 14:58.221
I heard "cookies."

14:58.255 --> 15:00.690
Um... oh, all right.

15:00.723 --> 15:03.926
How about, uh,
"Can only afford Hydrox,

15:03.960 --> 15:06.563
need money for Oreos."

15:06.596 --> 15:07.864
(laughs)

15:07.897 --> 15:10.199
Because they're
discount-ass Oreos.

15:10.233 --> 15:11.568
Yeah, that's funny.
Wr-Write that.

15:11.601 --> 15:13.370
All right.

15:17.039 --> 15:19.075
To think you know
how other people

15:19.108 --> 15:20.109
should think and feel.

15:20.142 --> 15:21.177
That is someone
with something

15:21.210 --> 15:22.211
seriously wrong
with them.

15:22.245 --> 15:23.713
That's psychopath
behavior.

15:23.746 --> 15:25.548
So what do we do
when she finally comes out?

15:25.582 --> 15:28.217
We follow her home
and egg her house. Duh.

15:28.251 --> 15:30.453
I had a better plan,
but apparently pig's blood is,

15:30.487 --> 15:32.054
like, 12 bucks a quart.

15:32.088 --> 15:35.057
Can I have some more of those?
Those are good.

15:35.091 --> 15:37.994
Gretchen...

15:39.329 --> 15:42.231
...tell me what I may
or may not have...

15:42.265 --> 15:46.269
maybe did by sorta-or-
not-mistake is okay.

15:46.303 --> 15:48.070
I'm not gonna absolve you
for stabbing Paul.

15:48.104 --> 15:49.972
What?! I didn't!

15:50.006 --> 15:52.074
Are you crazy?

15:52.108 --> 15:53.743
Who's watching Paul, anyway?

15:53.776 --> 15:56.746
He's fine. I set him up
with a pile of DVDs

15:56.779 --> 15:58.315
and yummy sandwiches.

15:59.949 --> 16:02.819
(panting):
Please.

16:02.852 --> 16:04.120
(grunts)

16:04.153 --> 16:05.688
Please go in.
(grunts)

16:06.456 --> 16:07.290
Please.

16:07.990 --> 16:08.825
Please.

16:08.858 --> 16:10.259
Please go in.

16:10.293 --> 16:11.628
(panting)

16:11.661 --> 16:13.262
Last one.

16:16.599 --> 16:18.335
Please!
(grunts)

16:18.368 --> 16:20.503
(TV chimes)

16:20.537 --> 16:21.438
Yes.

16:21.471 --> 16:23.340
Yes!

16:23.373 --> 16:25.908
Where's the thing? (panting)

16:25.942 --> 16:28.177
Where's the...

16:32.815 --> 16:34.817
(screaming)

16:39.288 --> 16:41.691
(sighs)

16:45.061 --> 16:47.464
(squeals, exhales)

16:49.499 --> 16:51.033
What are you doing?

16:51.067 --> 16:53.470
Nothing. What? Me and my
girlfriend were just making out.

16:53.503 --> 16:54.471
No.

16:54.504 --> 16:55.938
Don't-- no.

16:55.972 --> 16:57.940
Okay.

16:57.974 --> 16:59.342
(sighs)

16:59.376 --> 17:00.943
I don't know. Nothing.

17:00.977 --> 17:02.679
I was just gonna follow you home
or whatever.

17:02.712 --> 17:03.713
Why?

17:03.746 --> 17:04.781
To egg you.

17:04.814 --> 17:07.183
Not necessarily!

17:07.215 --> 17:09.685
I just wanted, you know,
to prove that you don't have

17:09.719 --> 17:11.954
any right to judge me.
Obviously.
You're right.

17:11.988 --> 17:14.323
I don't. Good night.

17:14.357 --> 17:17.727
Being vulnerable makes me angry!

17:19.729 --> 17:21.964
(sighs)

17:21.998 --> 17:24.300
I get that.

17:24.333 --> 17:26.167
Being vulnerable
is scary.

17:26.202 --> 17:28.304
But most people
don't even try.

17:28.337 --> 17:31.708
Like my boyfriend. He never
wants to talk about his stuff.

17:31.741 --> 17:34.677
He just squashes it down
and keeps it all on lock.

17:34.711 --> 17:37.213
Okay. So what happens to people
like your boyfriend?

17:37.246 --> 17:38.815
Oh, no... I don't know.

17:38.848 --> 17:40.550
We'll see, I guess.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.219
Hopefully he stops wearing
zip-up cargo shorts.

17:43.252 --> 17:46.723
But I know locked-down shit

17:46.756 --> 17:49.158
eventually becomes
unlocked-down.

17:49.191 --> 17:52.028
Eventually, a person has
to start taking responsibility

17:52.061 --> 17:53.262
for their own life.

17:53.295 --> 17:55.264
(gasps)
See? There it is.

17:55.297 --> 17:56.566
You're-you're blaming me again.

17:56.599 --> 17:58.334
Calls 'em like I sees 'em.

17:58.367 --> 18:00.069
(sighs)

18:00.102 --> 18:01.904
What was that you were saying

18:01.938 --> 18:04.674
about taking responsibility?
Ow.

18:04.707 --> 18:06.509
Look, I can guide,

18:06.543 --> 18:09.111
but a patient
has to do the work themselves.

18:09.145 --> 18:12.348
Eventually we all have to take
responsibility for our own life.

18:12.381 --> 18:14.984
So, I'll see you next week,
maybe?

18:16.419 --> 18:18.120
And don't stalk me again.

18:18.154 --> 18:20.156
'Cause you guys suck at it.

18:22.324 --> 18:24.894
I am so wet right now.

18:24.927 --> 18:27.597
Back off, bitch.

18:27.630 --> 18:29.699
(indistinct police transmission)
That part
you just read,

18:29.732 --> 18:32.635
it sounds too fancy. Like, just
make the language more regular.

18:32.669 --> 18:35.071
Tristan and Iris
are from upper-crust,

18:35.104 --> 18:37.139
early 20th century London.

18:37.173 --> 18:39.408
Why can't he just say
something like,

18:39.442 --> 18:41.611
"Iris, your twat's
driving me up the wall"?

18:41.644 --> 18:43.546
Okay. Anything else?
Shouldn't Simon

18:43.580 --> 18:45.247
and... the redhead...

18:45.281 --> 18:46.082
Kitty.

18:46.115 --> 18:47.984
Yeah. Kitty.

18:48.017 --> 18:50.386
Shouldn't they end up together
so people are happy?

18:50.419 --> 18:52.989
But theirs is
a taboo love forbidden

18:53.022 --> 18:56.493
by our current, ironically
more repressive society.

18:58.094 --> 18:59.496
Okay. That's a good note.

18:59.529 --> 19:02.331
All right.
Find a different ending,

19:02.364 --> 19:05.001
colloquialize the language
in the first third,

19:05.034 --> 19:07.637
find motivation
for the face-sitting,

19:07.670 --> 19:12.074
a few other tweaks.
All right, thank you, everybody.

19:12.108 --> 19:15.545
Here we are.
Also, there's
too much sex.

19:23.185 --> 19:25.555
*
(indistinct chatter)

19:30.359 --> 19:32.328
Edgar?

19:32.361 --> 19:33.462
What are you doing?

19:33.496 --> 19:35.464
So, I was thinking,

19:35.498 --> 19:37.800
"From future.
Time machine's broken.

19:37.834 --> 19:40.202
Need money for plutonium."
Then, in parentheses,

19:40.236 --> 19:43.139
"FYI, the Cowboys win
the Super Bowl next year."

19:43.172 --> 19:44.373
What do you think?

19:44.406 --> 19:45.508
What is going on with you?

19:48.244 --> 19:50.847
I got out of it.
But they're still here.

19:50.880 --> 19:54.050
Plus, I have useful
comedic skills and a Sharpie.

19:54.083 --> 19:56.553
I think that it's really nice
that you want to help them,

19:56.586 --> 19:58.521
but how 'bout helping
your girlfriend?

19:58.555 --> 20:00.356
Isn't that why
you're here?
You don't need it,

20:00.389 --> 20:02.391
not like they do.
You have a place to live.

20:04.026 --> 20:07.229
Maybe we could get the rest
of my stuff upstairs,

20:07.263 --> 20:10.700
and then we could use the boxes
to help you make some signs.

20:13.402 --> 20:15.037
Thank you.

20:16.505 --> 20:18.474
(fly buzzing)

20:18.507 --> 20:21.410
LINDSAY:
Paul? Sweetheart?
Wha...

20:21.443 --> 20:24.046
Lindsay?
Is that you?

20:24.080 --> 20:26.515
(grunting)

20:29.518 --> 20:31.821
It is.

20:31.854 --> 20:33.856
Poor dear.

20:33.890 --> 20:36.893
(grunting)

20:38.027 --> 20:39.228
Paul?

20:39.261 --> 20:40.529
Hmm?

20:40.563 --> 20:42.498
I'm sorry I was
gone all day.

20:42.531 --> 20:44.901
I'm prepared to...

20:44.934 --> 20:48.905
take responsibility for that.

20:48.938 --> 20:50.506
Do you forgive me?

20:50.539 --> 20:52.842
Of course I forgive y...
Great!

20:52.875 --> 20:54.677
(groans)
I took responsibility,

20:54.711 --> 20:56.412
and now it's in the past.

20:56.445 --> 20:58.347
Whoosh! Gone.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.349
I'll make us Red Napkin.

21:00.382 --> 21:02.084
I love you.

21:02.118 --> 21:03.552
Of course.

21:03.586 --> 21:05.755
We're family.

21:05.788 --> 21:07.523
(grunts)
Ow.

21:07.556 --> 21:09.959
*

21:15.798 --> 21:17.767
Should we just give up?

21:17.800 --> 21:21.037
Yeah, guess so.
(grunts)

21:21.070 --> 21:23.606
I just keep thinking
about my book.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.042
Therapist all up
in my cabeza.

21:26.075 --> 21:27.543
We're better than this!

21:27.576 --> 21:29.746
I don't know why I'm
so scared of doing

21:29.779 --> 21:32.414
some stupid,
Dr. Phil bullshit task.

21:32.448 --> 21:34.884
She's the one making it seem
like this Miyagi test.

21:34.917 --> 21:37.419
That's it. I'm gonna open
this goddamn mail.

21:37.453 --> 21:41.824
Then I'm gonna call my agent and
tell him to pull the proposal.

21:41.858 --> 21:44.827
Maybe this isn't even the book
that I want to write.

21:44.861 --> 21:46.696
Who knows?

21:47.764 --> 21:50.166
(exhales)

22:00.609 --> 22:02.578
(exhales)

22:02.611 --> 22:05.581
Gas bill. Easy.

22:05.614 --> 22:08.317
(laughs)

22:11.553 --> 22:14.556
Oh. Yeah, right, electricity.
I'm not paying you.

22:16.158 --> 22:17.794
No, I don't want
your stupid magazine!

22:18.527 --> 22:19.528
Nope.

22:21.664 --> 22:22.732
(exhales)

22:40.149 --> 22:41.851
No.

22:41.884 --> 22:45.521
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:45.554 --> 22:47.690
JIMMY:
Gretchen!

22:47.724 --> 22:50.026
My book! My book!

22:50.059 --> 22:51.660
The proposal sold!

22:51.694 --> 22:54.663
Ha! Suck it,
Edgar and-and Dorothy

22:54.697 --> 22:57.666
and that cop, old lady,
and businesswoman.

22:57.700 --> 22:59.001
I did it. Ha!

22:59.035 --> 23:01.037
I did it!
(yelps)

23:01.070 --> 23:03.005
Oh, my God, that's-that's great.

23:03.039 --> 23:05.007
Um, have you... have you talked
to your family recently?

23:05.041 --> 23:06.508
Mwah!

23:06.542 --> 23:08.510
Hell no. I blocked
all their numbers

23:08.544 --> 23:10.579
after their
disastrous visit. Why?

23:10.612 --> 23:11.814
Nothing.

23:11.848 --> 23:13.349
We get the offer on Monday.

23:13.382 --> 23:14.851
God, I love being a writer!

23:14.884 --> 23:16.418
I mean, not that
I'm surprised.

23:16.452 --> 23:18.921
This one felt so
good, you know?

23:18.955 --> 23:21.157
I sure left it all on the page
with this one.

23:21.190 --> 23:23.726
And my faith in it
never wavered. Not really.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.896
Nope, never wavered at all.

23:26.929 --> 23:29.365
*

23:39.441 --> 23:40.910
* My eyes are tired

23:40.943 --> 23:44.513
* And I'm a liar

23:44.546 --> 23:47.516
* I wish I had grace

23:47.549 --> 23:51.087
* But I can re-erase.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.555
*

24:05.434 --> 24:08.437
