00:12.221 --> 00:16.266
‐ My parents think caves are death traps,
but I love this!

00:16.266 --> 00:17.976
‐ What's not to love?

00:17.976 --> 00:20.687
When you know caves as well as I do,
they're not dangerous at‐‐

00:23.815 --> 00:25.484
Okay, that never happens.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.114
See?

00:31.114 --> 00:31.782
Safe as it‐‐

00:31.782 --> 00:33.033
gets.

01:04.106 --> 01:06.525
‐ Roomy, dusty, spooky,

01:06.525 --> 01:07.776
but not too spooky.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.403
This is my kinda cave.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.322
But why is your mom everywhere?

01:13.949 --> 01:15.325
Wait. Wh‐‐

01:16.076 --> 01:18.161
I think this is my mom's memory cave.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.288
After we moved to the farm,

01:19.288 --> 01:21.331
Mom said she needed a way
to remember the past.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.126
Look! It's my parents
before they were parents.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.128
Wow! They're so young.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.462
And hairy.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.131
‐ Guess that was the style back then.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.925
Look, that's my mom and me
before I was born.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.886
And there's my mom and dad
getting married.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.679
And that must be their first date.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.723
‐ What is that?

01:37.723 --> 01:39.433
And why is your mom jumping over it?

01:39.600 --> 01:40.475
No idea.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.436
But I know how we can find out.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.109
Mom, what is this?

01:49.693 --> 01:50.903
It's your father and me.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.822
Look how young we were, Grug.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.199
‐ That's not us.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.366
‐ Yes it is.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.327
We painted this together, remember?

01:58.327 --> 01:59.369
‐ Nope.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.495
Complete blank.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.373
‐ Ugh. You'd forget your own name
if I wasn't here to remind you.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.082
‐ Heh. True.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.460
It's‐it's Grug, right?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.712
Wait, that's not it.
Grug's not a real name.

02:08.712 --> 02:11.298
‐ No, I mean, what is that thing?

02:11.298 --> 02:12.966
Ah, that's a bullrus.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.928
Your dad and I,
we used to flop with the bullruses.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.429
It was so dangerous.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.097
We almost died every time.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.017
Those were the days.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.477
Ooh! Look at your dad's hair.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.812
It's like a river... of hair.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.232
‐ I had a pretty sweet mane back then.

02:28.232 --> 02:31.902
‐ You know, Eep,
I was about your age in this painting.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.112
Maybe it's time you and I went flopping.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.782
‐ Ooh! And me! Take me, please!

02:36.782 --> 02:39.159
‐ Whoo! Now you're talking
my talk words, Mom.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.786
‐ Absolutely not.

02:40.786 --> 02:41.745
‐ What? Why?

02:41.745 --> 02:43.288
‐ It's too dangerous.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.456
‐ But you did it!

02:44.915 --> 02:47.042
‐ Just because we did
reckless, life‐threatening things

02:47.042 --> 02:48.669
that were a blast and changed our lives

02:48.669 --> 02:50.045
doesn't mean you can.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.256
‐ So now you remember?

02:52.256 --> 02:54.424
‐ Well, of course.
Because it was awesome.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.178
Just like our love.

02:58.929 --> 02:59.888
‐ Your dad's right.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.057
We're your parents
and we're supposed to keep you alive.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.517
But I know how to make it up to you.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.812
A fun, mother‐daughter bonding day
at the hidden hot springs.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.146
Hot springs?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.273
How hot?

03:09.273 --> 03:12.025
‐ Uh, actually they're
more like warm springs.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.570
‐ Great. The exact opposite
of what I wanna do.

03:14.570 --> 03:15.737
Warm springs.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.406
Fine, but I get to bring Dawn.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.533
‐ I'm in. Warm springs!

03:19.533 --> 03:23.412
‐ Uh, yeah, actually, Eep, I was thinking
it would just be you and me.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.622
Besides, Dawn, your mom
would never be okay

03:25.622 --> 03:27.916
with you going beyond the wall
to the warm springs.

03:27.916 --> 03:28.917
Warm springs?

03:28.917 --> 03:30.294
We'd love to go.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.129
‐ And you should.

03:32.129 --> 03:32.796
Another time.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.339
Because today it's just me and Eep.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.341
‐ And me and Dawn? Great!

03:36.341 --> 03:38.343
‐ Uh, I mean, are you sure?

03:38.343 --> 03:40.095
The springs are actually pretty hot.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.139
‐ Hot? You said they were warm.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.600
‐ You know, it‐it's the warm side of hot.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.144
Plus, it's really far away.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.854
‐ Who cares how far away it is?

03:48.854 --> 03:52.065
Any amount of walking is worth it
for warm springs.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.860
‐ Or for flopping with the bullruses.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.361
So maybe we just do that instead.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.362
‐ I'm in!

03:57.362 --> 03:58.280
Bullruses!

03:58.280 --> 04:00.282
‐ Not a chance, Dawn. Way too dangerous.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.701
Besides, what's more exciting
than sitting in water

04:02.701 --> 04:04.828
that's the same temperature as the air?

04:04.828 --> 04:06.538
I love warm springs.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.248
‐ Warm springs? I'm in.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.167
‐ How did this go so wrong?

04:10.167 --> 04:11.251
‐ You're out, dear.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.462
This is
mother‐mother‐daughter‐daughter bonding.

04:13.462 --> 04:14.880
‐ Oh. I see.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.840
Well, I was kidding, obviously.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.133
'Twas a mere jest.

04:18.133 --> 04:21.929
I didn't actually want to join you
in a relaxing dip into luxurious waters

04:21.929 --> 04:23.347
warmed by Mother Earth herself.

04:23.347 --> 04:27.768
Because, uh, Grug and I are
going on a bro‐cation!

04:27.768 --> 04:29.228
‐ No, we're not.
‐ Yes, we are.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.438
It's going to be a real bro‐haha!

04:31.438 --> 04:34.441
‐ Well, we'll leave you
to your jam‐bro‐ree.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.110
‐ Yes. Enjoy your bro‐asis.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.779
‐ No, no, don't leave me here with‐‐

04:38.779 --> 04:40.322
‐ Ready to bro down, bro?

04:40.322 --> 04:42.491
‐ No! No more "bros."

04:42.491 --> 04:44.743
‐ As you wish... after a few more!

04:44.743 --> 04:46.411
For lunch, we'll have a bro‐becue

04:46.411 --> 04:49.748
with bro‐tisserie chicken seal
and mashed bro‐tatos.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.167
Okay, I'm done. For now.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.711
Isn't this refreshing?

04:54.711 --> 04:57.631
We're outside the wall,
in the great outdoors,

04:57.631 --> 05:00.008
hiking towards a secret paradise
of tepid water.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.802
‐ I'm just happy to be doing anything.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.762
‐ Right. Celebrate the little wins.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.931
And this win is definitely little.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.016
‐ And time for a break.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.769
‐ What? We just left the farm. Literally.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.771
‐ Sweetie, fan me.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.695
‐ You know,
the springs are still quite a hike.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.656
Why don't you and Dawn stay here
and take a dip in the lagoon

05:22.656 --> 05:25.325
while Eep and I
spend the day together alone?

05:25.325 --> 05:28.036
‐ Sorry, you sold me on warm, Uggs.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.955
Do you mind if I call you Uggs?

05:29.955 --> 05:34.126
You know, since we're journeying together
to a lukewarm oasis today?

05:34.126 --> 05:36.545
‐ And for the rest of our lives
at this pace.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.338
‐ Good point. Let's go, everyone.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.340
The springs aren't getting any warmer.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.717
And break.

05:41.717 --> 05:43.677
Sweetie, did I say stop fanning?

05:47.598 --> 05:52.186
‐ For the last time, I don't wanna go
on a "bro'd trip" with you.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.270
Nor do I, Grug.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.981
That was just a ruse
for our better halves.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.276
Because we're going to show them
what relaxing is all about.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.778
By pampering ourselves silly.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.696
‐ Have fun.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.199
I'm going crowverine hunting. Alone.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.785
‐ Yes. Hunting. Together. Good idea.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.454
‐ That's not what I said.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.663
‐ But it's what you meant.

06:11.663 --> 06:15.250
And I know how we can hunt smarter,
not harder.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.504
Instead of going out to hunt,
we'll bring the hunt to us.

06:18.504 --> 06:19.963
‐ That's not hunting.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.381
‐ Exactly.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.595
‐ Can we find another path?

06:26.595 --> 06:27.930
This one's too warm.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.765
‐ I don't think
that's how paths work, Mom.

06:29.765 --> 06:33.101
‐ If you don't like warm, why are you
going to the warm springs, Hope?

06:33.101 --> 06:34.520
‐ Because that's a wet warm.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.980
This is more of a dry warm.
Very different.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.190
Ugh.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.526
Why are there so many bugs outside?

06:43.987 --> 06:46.240
‐ Heads up! Incoming!

06:53.247 --> 06:55.624
‐ These bugs are a real problem.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.709
Oh. Hey, Uggs.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.586
You're a little on the close side.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.422
Let's embrace personal space.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.508
‐ I'll give you some space to embrace.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.676
‐ Thank you.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.302
Was that boulder always there?

07:07.761 --> 07:08.804
‐ No.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.349
‐ Whoa! That was amazing.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.393
Your mom is so cool!

07:14.393 --> 07:15.435
‐ Yeah.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.812
But your mom is also‐‐

07:16.812 --> 07:17.646
‐ Gah!

07:19.773 --> 07:20.816
‐ A mom.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.610
‐ No more bugs.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.488
‐ Whoa. And a master bug slayer, I guess.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.739
Where did that come from?

07:27.739 --> 07:28.991
‐ I don't know.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.285
I do know my mom hates bugs.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.662
She says they're like dirt with wings.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.455
‐ Can we find another path?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.124
This one's too buggy.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.501
‐ First, let's agree, if we get separated,

07:39.501 --> 07:41.837
you'll head directly back
to the farm, okay?

07:41.837 --> 07:43.505
‐ Sure. But that won't happen.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.799
‐ Of course not. Just a precaution.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.551
Whoa! What is that?

07:47.551 --> 07:48.886
‐ Where? What are we looking at?

07:49.636 --> 07:50.470
Ugga?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.306
‐ Mom, what are we doing?

07:52.306 --> 07:54.057
We're reclaiming our time together.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.185
If we don't move, she won't see us.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.644
‐ Ugga, I see you.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.439
‐ I know.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.233
That was a, uh, test separation.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.860
You were supposed to go back to the farm.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.987
But you're still here, so you failed.

08:06.987 --> 08:10.365
‐ Wait. Uggs, are you
trying to get rid of us?

08:10.365 --> 08:13.327
‐ Yes! I've been trying to get rid of you
since before we left.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.620
I want you to go home.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.998
‐ Wow. I'm starting to think
you want Dawn and me to go home.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.541
‐ Probably because I just said that.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.252
‐ Look, if you don't want us here,
just say so.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.462
‐ I did say so!

08:23.462 --> 08:24.713
Please leave!

08:24.713 --> 08:25.672
‐ But why?

08:25.672 --> 08:28.800
‐ Because today was supposed to be
just Eep and me.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.344
And we're not going to the warm springs.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.596
I just said that
so Grug wouldn't freak out.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.098
We're going
to the flopping of the bullruses.

08:35.098 --> 08:36.016
Yes!

08:36.016 --> 08:37.267
‐ No. Absolutely not.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.602
We're going home.

08:38.602 --> 08:39.937
Ugga, take us home.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.855
‐ Sure thing. You stay here
and we'll pick you up

08:41.855 --> 08:43.649
after we're done
flopping with the bullruses.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.901
If there's trouble,
just do what you did to those bugs.

08:45.901 --> 08:46.902
You'll be fine.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.655
‐ That's right, Mom.
We'll catch you on the flopside.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.115
‐ No. Dawn, you and I
are walking home on our own.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.704
Not today, bug.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.834
‐ But why can't I flop with the bullruses?

09:01.834 --> 09:03.001
I'm basically an adult.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.629
‐ If you were an adult,
you'd understand it's too dangerous.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.047
‐ But how do you even know?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.757
‐ I know because I'm your mother.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.342
It's my job to keep you safe.

09:10.342 --> 09:13.595
‐ Can you keep me safe the way
that Ugga keeps Eep safe?

09:13.595 --> 09:15.848
That safe is awesome.

09:15.848 --> 09:17.641
‐ Because that safe isn't safe.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.184
But my safe is safe.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.311
‐ Safe from, say, crowverines?

09:21.311 --> 09:24.398
‐ Crowverines, lethal fungi, sunburns,
you name it.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.983
‐ I meant those crowverines.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.489
‐ You know what? It's time to be
the bigger person and take the high road.

09:32.489 --> 09:35.659
We should find Ugga and forgive her
and then stay as close to her as possible.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.870
‐ But you just said‐‐
‐ Forgiveness waits for no one, Dawn.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.037
There's not a moment to lose.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.333
‐ Oh, no!

09:43.333 --> 09:45.419
Now we're gonna be late for forgiveness.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.129
Need some help?

09:47.129 --> 09:50.090
‐ You didn't think
we'd let you die out here, did you?

09:50.716 --> 09:52.634
‐ I didn't.

09:52.634 --> 09:53.969
But I'm trusting to a fault.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.430
Thanks for saving us.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.682
‐ And I'm so glad we ran into you

09:58.682 --> 10:00.434
because we've changed our minds.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.811
We'll come to this
flopping of the bullruses.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.397
But we'll be watching
from a safe distance.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.398
Very safe.

10:06.398 --> 10:09.276
We plan on making it out of this alive.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.070
So can we find another path?
This one has too many pits.

10:13.488 --> 10:14.323
See?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.158
Ugh!

10:16.158 --> 10:17.326
What are you spraying?

10:17.326 --> 10:19.161
It smells like dead flowers.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.078
‐ They're pheromones.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.246
And to beasts of the wild,

10:21.246 --> 10:24.458
the smell is so delightful,
they can't resist it.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.546
Beauty lies in the nose of the inhaler.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.715
Or the bro‐se, if you will.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.051
‐ Why is it making my hands so soft?

10:34.051 --> 10:35.093
‐ That's my hand.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.888
‐ So where are all the animals?

10:37.888 --> 10:41.016
‐ Oh, it takes a while
for the wind to scatter the scent,

10:41.016 --> 10:43.685
so let's just relax and go with the bro.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.771
‐ That has to be the last bro.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.106
‐ No way, Bro‐sè.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.610
‐ Got this scar during my last flop.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.864
I was sandwiched
between two bullruses out for blood.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.574
But the bullruses didn't want my blood.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.742
They wanted each other's blood.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.744
So, when they charged, I jumped.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.788
But one of their horns clipped my foot.

11:02.788 --> 11:05.749
And instead of getting squashed,
I got scarred.

11:05.749 --> 11:06.750
‐ Whoa.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.086
Scary... in a good way.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.839
Mom, do you have any scars like that?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.966
‐ Oh, sure, I have a scar.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.803
‐ I see it. I think.

11:17.803 --> 11:18.971
How did you get it?

11:18.971 --> 11:20.848
‐ It's quite a story.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.601
I got some mud on my arm,

11:24.601 --> 11:26.311
so I tried to scrub it off,

11:26.311 --> 11:27.813
but it was really on there.

11:27.813 --> 11:31.316
So I scrubbed harder and...
I scrubbed too hard.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.360
It's an eternal reminder of my ordeal.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.031
I'll be okay... in time.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.292
‐ Whoa, Mom. How'd you do that?

11:48.292 --> 11:50.586
‐ What, you think the hammocks at the farm
tied themselves?

11:50.586 --> 11:53.380
‐ No, but hammocks also don't attack.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.466
‐ And when something does attack,
you usually call for help.

11:56.466 --> 11:57.801
What's going on, Hope?

11:59.178 --> 12:00.888
‐ Maybe I'm tired of vines!

12:00.888 --> 12:02.306
And walking. And you.

12:02.306 --> 12:03.432
Why aren't we there yet?

12:03.432 --> 12:04.641
Let's move, people!

12:11.315 --> 12:13.233
‐ I can't wait
for the flopping of the bullruses.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.818
It's gonna be so much fun.

12:14.818 --> 12:15.444
Uh, to watch.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.571
‐ You're not just gonna watch, Dawn.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.488
You're gonna flop.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.408
‐ You heard my mom. It's a hard no.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.409
‐ And I'm a hard Eep.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.830
Hey, Hope. You look like
you could use some help.

12:26.830 --> 12:27.664
Want a hand?

12:27.664 --> 12:28.916
‐ Gladly.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.337
‐ And to pay me back for this,

12:33.337 --> 12:36.215
maybe you could let Dawn flop?

12:36.215 --> 12:38.091
‐ Never. Under any circumstances.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.009
No. My answer's no.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.720
‐ Before you answer,
let me just say one thing.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.640
Please! You have to let her do it.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.975
Please, please, please,
please, please, please!

12:47.726 --> 12:49.061
‐ Sorry, Mom.

12:49.061 --> 12:50.521
Eep, too much.

12:50.521 --> 12:51.813
‐ Got her right where I want her.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.398
Oh, see?

12:53.398 --> 12:54.775
Sounds like a yes to me.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.361
‐ Sounds like a growl to me.

12:57.361 --> 12:58.737
‐ It is a growl.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.447
A bearacuda growl.

13:00.906 --> 13:04.034
Make that three bearacuda growls.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.726
Dawn didn't like napping
when she was a baby.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.270
That was the only way
I could put her to sleep.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.241
‐ Now this is hunting.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.993
‐ Doesn't feel like hunting.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.620
‐ That's because you're stuck
in your old habits.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.248
When the animals come running,
thanks to the pheromones,

13:51.248 --> 13:54.042
they'll see us out here,
floating and relaxing.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.794
And that's when we strike!

13:55.794 --> 13:58.547
Now, put these cucumbeet slices
on your eyes.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.215
‐ Oh, what are these for?

14:00.215 --> 14:02.759
‐ Camouflage. And they reduce puffiness.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.511
For hunting.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.307
Those are bullruses?

14:08.307 --> 14:09.850
They don't look dangerous.

14:09.850 --> 14:10.434
‐ Yeah.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.436
They look like they ate too much
but now they regret it

14:12.436 --> 14:14.771
so they're ready to start
making changes in their lives.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.316
I spend a lot of time alone.

14:17.316 --> 14:20.068
‐ They look harmless
because they're not flopping yet.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.987
‐ So why don't we leave them that way?

14:21.987 --> 14:24.656
This could be
the "leaving alone of the bullruses."

14:24.656 --> 14:25.824
‐ Oh, silly Hope.

14:25.824 --> 14:29.286
Let me explain why bullruses
and flopping are inseparable.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.662
‐ Dawn, you're doing this.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.207
So here's the plan, desert camouflage.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.374
We'll put you in a cactus

14:34.374 --> 14:36.376
and your mom won't even know
you're flopping.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.921
‐ Oh. Wearing a cactus sounds fun.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.255
And painful.

14:40.255 --> 14:43.383
But I don't want my mom to worry,
so I'm gonna pass.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.635
‐ What? Are you sure?

14:44.635 --> 14:46.053
‐ I really wanna go.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.554
But my mom's not a flopper.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.223
So I guess I'm not either.

14:49.223 --> 14:51.475
‐ I hear ya. Blood runs thicker than flop.

14:51.475 --> 14:52.935
‐ Right. And ew.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.770
‐ Time to go. We're losing flop light.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.147
‐ Okay. So how does it work again?

14:57.147 --> 14:58.982
‐ We make our way into the bullrus herd.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.527
And when they start flopping
we make our way out.

15:01.527 --> 15:02.361
If we can.

15:02.361 --> 15:03.111
You'll love it.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.489
‐ Yeah I will.
Because we'll be flopping together.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.086
They're a lot bigger up close.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.171
But not as floppy as I expected.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.381
Are you sure they're alive?

15:22.381 --> 15:24.716
‐ Oh, yeah.
You just gotta get 'em started.

15:24.716 --> 15:25.551
Are you ready?

15:25.551 --> 15:28.011
‐ I've been ready ever since
I found out this was a thing.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.054
Thanks for bringing me, Mom.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.306
‐ Aw. There's no one I'd rather flop with.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.808
Okay, here we go.

15:39.565 --> 15:41.984
Hmm. That's not it. How about‐‐

15:45.153 --> 15:46.780
Don't worry. Don't worry.
It'll come to me.

15:49.783 --> 15:50.325
Hmm.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.921
‐ Is it me or is there
not a lot of flopping in this flopping?

16:02.921 --> 16:04.423
‐ Because they're doing it wrong.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.924
You're supposed to whistle.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.217
‐ How do you know that?

16:07.217 --> 16:10.971
‐ Oh, I, um, I knew someone
who used to flop a long time ago.

16:10.971 --> 16:14.641
‐ Why... won't... you... flop?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.226
Ugh!

16:17.186 --> 16:19.521
‐ Man, looks like this flop is a flop.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.149
‐ What am I doing wrong?

16:22.149 --> 16:24.359
‐ Well, if they won't flop,
it's safe enough for Dawn.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.277
Hey, Dawn!

16:32.326 --> 16:34.494
‐ A whistle! I knew it was something.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.913
This is it, Eep!

16:35.913 --> 16:37.372
The floppening!

16:51.136 --> 16:51.803
Mom!

16:54.014 --> 16:55.349
This is awesome!

16:56.767 --> 16:57.768
Ohh!

17:00.687 --> 17:01.772
Whoa. Ha! Tail tag!

17:01.772 --> 17:03.106
Head hop!

17:04.149 --> 17:05.567
‐ Tusk tap!

17:06.693 --> 17:07.486
What?

17:07.486 --> 17:09.154
‐ I said tongue tie!

17:11.323 --> 17:14.076
Also, this is wet warm in a bad way

17:15.827 --> 17:17.120
Having fun?

17:17.120 --> 17:18.872
‐ So... much... fun!

17:34.805 --> 17:37.766
Is it just me
or are the bullruses getting floppier?

17:37.766 --> 17:39.142
‐ Yeah, and rowdier.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.228
You know, let's get out of here
before the flopping gets‐‐

17:41.228 --> 17:42.646
Worse.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.526
‐ It looks like so much flopping fun!

17:47.526 --> 17:49.778
‐ No, that's a flopping nightmare.

17:49.778 --> 17:50.696
They're in trouble.

17:50.696 --> 17:53.574
And those bullruses are gonna flatten them
if somebody doesn't save them.

17:53.574 --> 17:55.033
Good thing I'm here.

17:55.033 --> 17:55.951
‐ What do you mean?

17:55.951 --> 17:57.661
Oh, for emotional support?

17:57.661 --> 17:59.288
‐ Going in, Dawn. Don't move.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.707
‐ Going in where? There?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.458
Woo‐hoo!

18:03.458 --> 18:04.042
‐ Mom?

18:08.088 --> 18:08.922
‐ What now?

18:08.922 --> 18:10.966
‐ Don't panic. There's always a way out.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.217
Or there used to be.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.427
It's been a long time.

18:13.427 --> 18:14.595
Bullruses have changed.

18:14.595 --> 18:15.929
Or maybe it's me.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.055
You know, when you get older‐‐

18:17.055 --> 18:18.515
‐ Now's not the time, Mom!

18:18.515 --> 18:19.516
‐ Oh, right, right. You're right.

18:19.516 --> 18:20.767
Let's flop or drop.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.102
‐ Catch you on the flopside, Mom.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.025
‐ Ha! Huh!

18:28.483 --> 18:29.318
Ha!

18:33.572 --> 18:34.948
Flop with me if you wanna live.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.266
‐ Hope! What... was... that?

19:01.266 --> 19:02.768
‐ Does Dawn know you can do that?

19:02.768 --> 19:04.895
She is gonna freak out!

19:04.895 --> 19:06.313
I'm freaking out!

19:06.313 --> 19:10.150
I'm sorry! I just wanted to hel‐l‐lp!

19:10.150 --> 19:12.236
‐ Ugh. I told her, "Don't move!"

19:12.236 --> 19:14.154
Now, I'm telling you, don't move.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.032
‐ Oh!

19:17.032 --> 19:18.116
‐ Oh, no.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.076
‐ Yikes.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.327
‐ That had to hurt.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.954
‐ Where's Dawn?

19:23.997 --> 19:25.832
‐ Hey, guys. Talk about a one stop flop.

19:27.459 --> 19:28.460
I feel sick.

19:32.548 --> 19:34.883
‐ Cliffs should be less cliff‐y.

19:35.759 --> 19:36.552
What?

19:38.470 --> 19:41.932
Fine. I used to flop
with the bullruses a lot.

19:41.932 --> 19:45.102
I was young and reckless and fearless.

19:45.102 --> 19:46.353
Oh, and beautiful and charming.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.855
‐ Why didn't you tell us?

19:47.855 --> 19:49.064
‐ What's to tell?

19:49.064 --> 19:50.524
I used to flop and now I don't.

19:50.524 --> 19:54.236
‐ Uh, tell that to the bullruses
you just flopped all over.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.362
That was amazing!

19:55.362 --> 19:57.698
I can't believe this Hope
is the same as tree house Hope.

19:57.698 --> 20:01.118
‐ Yes, well, it happened
and now it'll never happen again.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.786
I have different priorities now.

20:02.786 --> 20:05.122
Like the farm and our family.

20:05.122 --> 20:07.040
So no one can ever know about this.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.542
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.836
I didn't want you to get hurt like I did.

20:10.836 --> 20:11.545
Wait a minute.

20:11.545 --> 20:14.840
Is that how you got
that little scar, from flopping?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.884
‐ Oh, no, that was from scrubbing.

20:16.884 --> 20:18.468
But this scar is from flopping.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.220
‐ Oh! That's awful.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.430
‐ Yup. Can't unsee that.

20:21.430 --> 20:24.766
‐ Whoa. That's the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.894
‐ I know, right? Thanks.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.230
Now get away from that ledge
before you hurt yourself.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.150
‐ There she is.
That's the Hope from the tree house.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.985
‐ Well, it was fun while it lasted.

20:34.985 --> 20:38.280
‐ You know, as flops go,
this one might be the best.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.823
‐ So it's a top flop?

20:39.823 --> 20:41.200
‐ Yup. Flop shelf.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.411
‐ I wanna remember this forever.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.413
‐ And I know how we can.

20:50.626 --> 20:53.754
‐ So we all agree,
this never happened, right?

20:53.754 --> 20:54.421
Right.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.715
‐ And now there's one more thing
I wanna do.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.553
Phil, if animals show up and attack,

21:01.553 --> 21:03.430
we're wide open like this.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.683
Relax, Grug. We're apex predators.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.560
We're invincible.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.896
‐ This was never a hunt, was it?

21:10.896 --> 21:11.897
‐ Sure it was.

21:11.897 --> 21:14.066
It was a hunt for relaxation.

21:14.066 --> 21:14.900
For both of us.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.444
Because you are a tight coil of rage

21:17.444 --> 21:19.446
and I do everything around here.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.405
We deserve it.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.157
‐ But what about the pair‐o‐bones?

21:22.157 --> 21:23.700
Uh, the‐the‐the hair‐o‐phones?

21:23.700 --> 21:25.035
‐ You mean pheromones?

21:25.035 --> 21:27.579
‐ Yeah, the smell stuff
that animals smell.

21:29.164 --> 21:32.501
‐ Moisturizer. Infused with lavender
to promote relaxation.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.754
‐ Ohh. So that's why my hands are so soft.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.214
‐ That's still my hand.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.216
‐ Ugh!

21:40.300 --> 21:42.761
Stupid, silky, baby‐soft hands.

21:42.761 --> 21:43.720
‐ Are you mad?

21:43.720 --> 21:46.056
‐ I'm too relaxed to be mad.

21:46.056 --> 21:49.059
But if anyone asks, this never happened.

21:49.059 --> 21:49.852
‐ Indeed.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.603
We'll keep it on the down‐bro.

21:53.564 --> 21:56.275
‐ Well, here's another thing
we'll keep on the down‐bro

21:56.275 --> 21:58.735
because I'll never say it again.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.112
You're a good friend, Phil.

22:00.112 --> 22:01.488
Thanks for today.

22:01.989 --> 22:03.448
Speechless, huh?

22:03.448 --> 22:05.284
Yeah, I get that.

22:05.284 --> 22:07.244
This is a real bro‐ment.

22:08.704 --> 22:10.080
Okay, I'll admit it.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.041
Warm springs are way better
than I expected.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.961
‐ It's no near‐death experience,
but it's not bad.

22:15.961 --> 22:16.837
Thanks, Hope.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.255
Don't sweat it, Uggs.

22:18.255 --> 22:20.632
‐ Yeah, about that nickname‐‐

22:25.304 --> 22:27.514
‐ Ooh. A wet warm.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.432
Phil!

22:29.474 --> 22:31.977
Get out of here right now
before you ruin our day!

22:35.147 --> 22:36.982
Sorry, Uggs. You were saying?

22:36.982 --> 22:38.859
‐ Uh, nothing. Nothing at all.
