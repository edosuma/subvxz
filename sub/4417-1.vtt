WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:04.086
MOLLY:
<i>My name is Molly Woods.</i>

00:04.170 --> 00:06.005
<i>I'm an astronaut.</i>

00:06.089 --> 00:08.007
<i>My husband John,</i>
<i>a robotics engineer,</i>

00:08.090 --> 00:11.594
<i>created a lifelike robot</i>
<i>called a Humanich.</i>

00:11.678 --> 00:14.431
<i>We adopted the prototype</i>
<i>as our son.</i>

00:14.514 --> 00:16.224
<i>His name is Ethan.</i>

00:16.306 --> 00:18.476
This is what we wanted.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.814
<i>Everything changed</i>
<i>when I went to space</i>

00:22.897 --> 00:24.274
<i>on a 13-month solo mission.</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:26.109
<i>I didn't come home alone.</i>

00:26.192 --> 00:28.778
{\an5}I'm pregnant.
How is that
even possible?

00:28.862 --> 00:31.072
<i>The child--</i>
<i>part human, part alien--</i>

00:31.156 --> 00:33.324
<i>was unlike anything</i>
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

00:33.408 --> 00:35.410
How did you get
so big so fast?

00:35.493 --> 00:37.787
<i>And he was dangerous.</i>

00:37.871 --> 00:40.915
{\an1}You need to tell them
not to come.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.293
I can't. We need to survive.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.588
We know this being can somehow
access our minds

00:46.671 --> 00:48.757
<i>and make us see and do things</i>
<i>beyond our control.</i>

00:48.840 --> 00:50.842
MOLLY:
<i>Ethan tried to stop him...</i>

00:50.925 --> 00:51.634
I know he's your son.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.595
<i>I won't hurt him again.</i>

00:53.678 --> 00:54.679
<i>...and sacrificed himself</i>
<i>in the process.</i>

00:54.763 --> 00:57.140
Run!

01:01.227 --> 01:03.646
Ethan?
<i>We lost Ethan.</i>

01:03.730 --> 01:04.813
<i>And my other son...</i>

01:04.897 --> 01:06.941
<i>is still out there.</i>

01:19.037 --> 01:21.247
(kissing, passionate breathing)

01:31.216 --> 01:32.175
{\an3}Hey.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.968
What's the matter?

01:34.052 --> 01:35.678
MOLLY:
<i>Change scenario.</i>

01:35.762 --> 01:37.722
(electronic chime)

01:37.806 --> 01:38.848
(electronic whirr)

01:38.932 --> 01:40.517
Let's get some ice cream.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.185
Hot fudge sundae?

01:42.268 --> 01:45.355
{\an3}With whipped cream
and sprinkles.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.024
And pistachio ice cream.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.486
Pistachio.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.825
I miss you, sweetheart.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.202
I'm right here, Mom.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.206
(electronic chime)

02:03.289 --> 02:04.874
MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Molly Woods,

02:04.958 --> 02:06.209
your virtual reality session
is terminated.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.585
(electronic whoosh,
Molly gasps)

02:07.669 --> 02:08.877
It's time for your medication.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.839
(sighs)

02:10.922 --> 02:13.049
Molly Woods...

02:13.132 --> 02:14.384
{\an1}it's time
for your medication.

02:16.135 --> 02:18.054
Molly Woods...

02:18.137 --> 02:21.349
this is my third
and final request.

02:24.686 --> 02:25.937
(sighs)

02:28.356 --> 02:31.401
{\an1}WOMAN: Can we give you
a ride home?

02:31.484 --> 02:34.028
{\an1}It's okay.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.531
{\an1}MAN: It's pretty cold outside.
You must be freezing.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.908
{\an1}WOMAN:
We aren't gonna hurt you.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.411
{\an4}Don't know how old.
Maybe ten or 11?
(baby crying in distance)

02:41.494 --> 02:43.246
Hasn't said a word
since we found him.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.248
{\an6}(crying)
Four, four and
a half feet tall.

02:45.331 --> 02:48.418
{\an3}Wearing a red hooded
sweatshirt, jeans, sneakers.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.963
About an hour ago.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.882
(crying continues)

02:53.965 --> 02:56.217
Appreciate that, Officer.
How soon can you get here?

02:56.301 --> 02:59.304
(door creaking)

02:59.387 --> 03:00.972
(crying stops)

03:10.023 --> 03:11.691
(baby babbles)

03:24.203 --> 03:25.788
(crying)

03:25.872 --> 03:28.124
(baby cries louder)

03:28.207 --> 03:29.000
{\an1}MAN:
Yes.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.627
2087 Farmdale Road.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.129
(thudding, baby crying)

03:33.212 --> 03:34.339
Ed...

03:37.342 --> 03:39.010
Ed!

03:39.093 --> 03:42.639
Justin! Justin, your mommy
and daddy are right here, baby!

03:42.722 --> 03:44.140
Come on, son,
open the door.

03:44.223 --> 03:46.142
(crying continues)

03:46.225 --> 03:47.644
{\an1}ED: What the hell is
going on here?

03:47.727 --> 03:49.062
Baby, Mama's coming!

03:49.979 --> 03:51.940
(latch clicks, door creaks)

03:52.023 --> 03:54.484
(crying continues)

03:58.237 --> 03:59.989
Oh, my baby!

04:00.073 --> 04:02.158
(crying): Oh, sweetie.

04:02.241 --> 04:04.327
Oh, baby...

04:04.410 --> 04:06.704
(mother crying)

04:06.788 --> 04:08.247
{\an1}(sighs)

04:08.331 --> 04:10.833
ED:
What the...?

04:15.421 --> 04:16.964
{\an3}(screaming)

04:25.640 --> 04:27.308
MOLLY:
<i>At that point, Senator,</i>

04:27.392 --> 04:29.894
having lost all communication
with Mission Control,

04:29.978 --> 04:32.647
and knowing that the spores
were contained on the <i> Seraphim,</i>

04:32.730 --> 04:35.316
I made the call
to destroy the station.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.151
I managed escape pod separation

04:37.235 --> 04:39.570
just 18 seconds
before the station's detonation.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.573
It was at that time that

04:42.657 --> 04:44.867
{\an3}you and colleague
Sean Glass

04:44.951 --> 04:46.160
made your way back to Earth.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.371
Yes, sir.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.039
And Mr. Glass?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.916
He died...

04:52.000 --> 04:53.876
very shortly after our return.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.169
But you were not affected

04:55.253 --> 04:56.295
by the spores?

04:57.463 --> 05:00.842
(gasping)

05:00.925 --> 05:02.218
No, sir.

05:02.301 --> 05:04.053
These microbes--

05:04.137 --> 05:05.888
{\an3}or spores,

05:05.972 --> 05:07.390
as you call them--

05:07.473 --> 05:10.685
have been definitively confirmed
as alien life-forms?

05:10.768 --> 05:12.895
{\an1}Yes, Senator,
and without a doubt,

05:12.979 --> 05:15.064
there is life out there.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.901
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

05:18.985 --> 05:20.570
{\an3}How can you be
certain that

05:20.653 --> 05:22.113
the threat
to Earth has been contained?

05:22.196 --> 05:23.448
When the <i> Seraphim</i> exploded,

05:23.531 --> 05:25.199
the alien microbes
were destroyed in space,

05:25.283 --> 05:27.118
and no longer
pose a threat to us.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.911
{\an3}So, to your
best knowledge,

05:28.995 --> 05:32.415
no alien life-forms have
set foot on the planet Earth?

05:32.498 --> 05:34.250
No ETs

05:34.334 --> 05:36.753
{\an3}running around
trying to phone home?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.216
(laughs softly)

05:45.011 --> 05:46.471
That is correct.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.307
Well, thanks to your efforts,
Dr. Woods,

05:49.390 --> 05:52.727
we owe you a debt of gratitude
for showing extreme bravery

05:52.810 --> 05:55.396
in terrifying circumstances.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.442
This hearing is now adjourned.

06:02.862 --> 06:06.074
Bravo to Molly Woods.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.960
{\an1}You okay?

06:18.044 --> 06:20.004
Well, I just lied
under oath, Toby,

06:20.088 --> 06:21.631
so, no, I am not okay.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.132
Molly, what good would it do

06:23.216 --> 06:25.134
to scare the hell
out of the public?

06:25.218 --> 06:27.261
{\an1}Especially when we know
the threat has been contained?

06:27.345 --> 06:30.264
{\an1}What do you think would happen
if we told them the truth?

06:30.348 --> 06:31.766
Anarchy.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.185
{\an1}Exactly.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.354
{\an1}I've been heading up
the Global Security Commission

06:36.437 --> 06:38.439
for six very long months now.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.359
{\an1}Learned more about pandemics,
terrorist threats and...

06:41.442 --> 06:44.112
{\an1}(quietly): aliens than
anyone should know,

06:44.195 --> 06:45.822
if they ever want
to sleep at night.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.448
{\an1}Most important thing
I've learned--

06:47.532 --> 06:49.450
people spook easily.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.828
And when they spook,

06:51.911 --> 06:54.163
they do irrational things,

06:54.247 --> 06:56.833
dangerous things.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.043
{\an1}WOMAN:
General?

06:59.127 --> 07:01.671
The car's ready to take you
and Dr. Woods to the airport.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.798
Thank you.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.968
Come on.

07:07.051 --> 07:09.971
Toby...

07:10.054 --> 07:11.681
are you sure he's dead?

07:14.058 --> 07:15.977
Had some sort of seizure

07:16.060 --> 07:20.356
{\an3}right after that couple picked
him up a few weeks back.

07:20.439 --> 07:23.609
We've got the body, if you
need to see the pictures.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.070
No, I don't need to see.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.323
I just had to ask you
one last time.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.701
He was dangerous, Molly.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.911
I know.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.874
{\an3}The weight of the world is
officially off your shoulders.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.584
Get some rest.
(chuckles)

07:39.667 --> 07:41.377
Take a vacation,
for God's sake.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.921
{\an3}When you get back, I'll
take you and John for dinner,

07:44.005 --> 07:45.631
and we can all reminisce

07:45.715 --> 07:47.550
{\an3}about my drunken toast
at your wedding.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.344
{\an1}(both laughing)
When you proposed to me?

07:50.428 --> 07:52.847
Hey, well, you can't blame a guy
for trying.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.350
Come on.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.269
{\an3}I thought for sure
John'd be here.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.688
{\an3}Where is the
competition today?

08:00.771 --> 08:02.565
Where he always is.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.151
(electronic whirring,
blipping)

08:06.319 --> 08:08.821
Okay, let's try this again.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.242
{\an3}(sighs)
Better?

08:13.326 --> 08:16.412
Something's limiting
his sensor pathways.

08:16.495 --> 08:18.372
The response isn't proportionate
to the stimulus.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.708
The calibration of his hand
touch receptors must be off.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.544
{\an1}Probably because
of his upgraded body.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.130
His responses seem
pretty close to normal.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.259
Watch yours.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.886
It's not the palm.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.929
His fingertip
sensitivity's weak.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.890
{\an3}Your fingertips seem
pretty responsive.

08:35.972 --> 08:37.099
Julie...

08:37.183 --> 08:38.267
(doors hiss open)

08:42.020 --> 08:44.232
Molly.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.777
Hey.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.237
I wasn't expecting
you till tomorrow.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.155
I took the last flight out.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.157
Thought I'd surprise you.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.200
{\an3}I have an even better
surprise for you.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.368
{\an3}Come here.

08:56.535 --> 08:57.245
Hi, Molly.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.746
Julie.

09:00.539 --> 09:01.791
He's ready.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.793
What? He's ready?

09:03.876 --> 09:05.753
{\an4}Yeah.
I thought it was
gonna be months.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.338
No, his-his neural pathways,

09:07.421 --> 09:09.632
{\an1}his-his consciousness,
was intact.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.635
{\an1}It-it-it took much less time
than I expected.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.971
Okay.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.973
Here. Go ahead.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.232
(electronic whirring,
powering up)

09:44.375 --> 09:45.751
(gasps)

09:47.712 --> 09:49.380
Ethan.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.091
Mom.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.678
{\an1}(crying):
Oh, God. Oh!

09:55.761 --> 09:57.930
Oh!

09:58.014 --> 09:59.390
{\an1}Ethan.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.188
(crying):
You're back.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.024
ETHAN:
<i>It feels weird.</i>

10:08.107 --> 10:09.817
Weird how?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.403
To be back in my body
again, but... bigger.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.822
Well, that's 'cause
you're growing up.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.616
{\an1}Can you describe
where you've been?

10:20.161 --> 10:24.123
It was like I was a bird,
free to go anywhere,

10:24.206 --> 10:27.251
and now I'm... not.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.713
Did I die?

10:30.796 --> 10:33.049
{\an1}No, no, somehow,
you uploaded yourself

10:33.132 --> 10:35.509
{\an1}to the cloud,
just before the explosion.

10:35.593 --> 10:39.013
{\an1}Turns out, you-you-you
can't die exactly.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.433
Because I'm not human.

10:42.516 --> 10:44.852
No. You're so much more
than that.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.104
{\an1}MOLLY:
Ethan, you saved

10:47.188 --> 10:49.106
my life on the <i> Seraphim.</i>

10:49.190 --> 10:51.525
You sacrificed yourself for me.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.862
{\an1}Now, that was brave
and very selfless of you.

10:54.945 --> 10:58.199
{\an1}And you may not be...
technically human,

10:58.282 --> 11:00.618
{\an1}but you've got
more humanity in you

11:00.701 --> 11:02.411
than most people
on this planet.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.914
And that's all that matters.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.416
You hear me?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.251
I hear you.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.586
{\an1}MOLLY (softly):
Good.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.755
You're my son...

11:12.838 --> 11:15.299
and I love you.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.140
No matter what happens.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.611
(sighs)

11:47.373 --> 11:49.500
(crickets chirping)

11:58.008 --> 11:59.468
Gina?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.762
Yes, Molly?

12:01.846 --> 12:04.098
I'd like to see...

12:04.181 --> 12:06.475
security cam footage

12:06.559 --> 12:10.104
from the week of July 10.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.690
The week before
you returned from space?

12:14.400 --> 12:17.570
Yes. That's right.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.781
I'm sorry, Molly, but cameras
were offline during that period.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.492
(quiet whirring)

12:26.704 --> 12:29.874
(whirring)

12:30.916 --> 12:34.003
Gina...

12:34.086 --> 12:38.632
Peter Robot has a
motion-activated camera, right?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.593
Yes, Molly.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.386
Can you access that drive?

12:42.470 --> 12:43.721
(whirring continues)

12:43.804 --> 12:46.015
Same time frame, please.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.517
What would you like to see?

12:52.730 --> 12:55.232
All footage of John.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.445
And Julie.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.804
♪ ♪

13:51.830 --> 13:55.251
Gina, can you go
to last time stamp, please?

14:00.297 --> 14:02.258
Is there sound?

14:02.341 --> 14:04.760
Sorry. Peter Robot
is video only.

14:04.843 --> 14:07.221
{\an3}Can you use
facial rec software

14:07.304 --> 14:09.139
to analyze and translate?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.267
I'll try, Molly.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.104
GINA: "...do this anymore.
She's coming home."

14:15.187 --> 14:17.982
"This isn't right.
What we have is special."

14:18.065 --> 14:19.775
"Molly has been away a year."

14:19.858 --> 14:21.402
"...built a family.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.612
"You can't just take that
and throw it away

14:23.696 --> 14:24.822
like it doesn't mean any..."

14:24.905 --> 14:27.741
"Do you love me?"

14:27.825 --> 14:30.202
{\an3}JOHN:
Stop playback.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.973
Molly, it's been over
for a while, I swear.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.692
It was a mistake.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.611
(exhales)

15:05.779 --> 15:07.656
A mistake?

15:11.076 --> 15:14.371
A mistake...

15:14.455 --> 15:17.708
is a coding error...

15:17.791 --> 15:20.544
or a broken plate.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.963
This, what you've been doing...

15:23.047 --> 15:24.882
is lying...

15:24.965 --> 15:26.634
over and over

15:26.717 --> 15:28.844
{\an1}and over.
Yes, I-I did.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.846
I-I lied, but...

15:30.929 --> 15:32.890
{\an1}it didn't happen
in a vacuum.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.434
You-you were not here.
I'm an astronaut.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.186
It's my job.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.146
{\an1}This is not about going
to space, Molly.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.522
There's a piece of you

15:40.606 --> 15:43.192
that's... not in this marriage,

15:43.275 --> 15:45.152
{\an3}and never has been.
Well,

15:45.235 --> 15:48.614
if you weren't happy, then you
should've said something,

15:48.697 --> 15:51.241
not screw your lab assistant
in our house!

15:53.285 --> 15:54.745
(sudden banging)

15:54.828 --> 15:56.372
Are you John Woods?

15:56.455 --> 15:58.582
{\an6}Yeah.
I have a court order
authorizing the seizure

15:58.666 --> 16:00.751
{\an5}of the Humanich.
What are you
talking about?

16:00.834 --> 16:03.420
{\an5}The Humanich has been
declared the property
of the U.S. Government

16:03.504 --> 16:04.880
for reasons
of national security.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.340
{\an1}ETHAN (in distance):
Dad!

16:06.423 --> 16:08.425
He's not property--
he's our son!

16:08.509 --> 16:10.469
ETHAN: Mom!
MOLLY: Ethan!

16:10.552 --> 16:12.763
JOHN:
Ethan! Get your hands off me!

16:12.846 --> 16:13.847
MOLLY: Ethan!
JOHN: Ethan!

16:13.931 --> 16:16.183
{\an1}Ethan...!

16:16.266 --> 16:18.811
{\an4}Don't worry!
We're gonna come get you!
Mom!

16:18.894 --> 16:20.604
Ethan!
Mom...!

16:28.404 --> 16:31.281
{\an1}Marko, increase the speed
by 15 miles per hour.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.743
MARKO: That will exceed
legal speed limits by 32%.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.662
Okay, override the safeties.
Do it.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.836
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

16:47.840 --> 16:48.924
The general's expecting you.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.926
Right this way.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.762
{\an3}Sure.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.975
{\an1}Uh-huh. Well, get... get back
to me as soon as you can.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.852
{\an3}What'd you find out?
Where are they taking him?

16:59.935 --> 17:02.354
They can't do this, Toby.
This is kidnapping!

17:02.438 --> 17:04.982
I need you both to sit down.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.656
{\an1}HomeSec
perceives Ethan

17:12.740 --> 17:15.117
to be a threat
to national security.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.577
{\an3}What?!

17:16.660 --> 17:18.787
What? That's ridiculous!

17:18.871 --> 17:21.457
Ethan hacked directly
into the ISEA mainframe--

17:21.540 --> 17:24.460
which was bad enough--
but then he blew up a building.

17:24.542 --> 17:25.836
JOHN: Saving Molly

17:25.919 --> 17:27.463
{\an3}and potentially
everyone on the planet.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.131
{\an3}For God's sake,
Toby, he's a hero!

17:29.214 --> 17:30.799
{\an1}He's a little boy!
Who blew through

17:30.883 --> 17:33.469
terrasoc firewalls like they
were tissue paper, Molly.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.262
{\an1}There are some
genuine concerns here

17:35.345 --> 17:37.097
{\an3}that you can't ignore.
The timing's

17:37.181 --> 17:39.475
{\an3}a bit convenient, no?
Molly gets into bed

17:39.558 --> 17:41.643
{\an3}with the GSC,
an arm of HomeSec,

17:41.727 --> 17:43.395
{\an3}and now suddenly Ethan's
being decommissioned?

17:43.479 --> 17:45.939
{\an3}Come on, Toby, wha...
what's this really about?

17:46.023 --> 17:47.983
This is much bigger than Ethan.

17:51.945 --> 17:55.824
The whole Humanichs project
is being mothballed, John.

17:55.908 --> 17:56.950
What?!

17:57.034 --> 17:59.787
All service bots
rated 4.0 or higher

17:59.870 --> 18:01.955
are being seized
and decommissioned.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.874
{\an4}Now, this comes
from the highest
level of HomeSec.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.835
And I have pulled every string,
I have made every call

18:06.919 --> 18:08.003
there is to make.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.671
{\an1}Now, my hands are tied
on this, I'm sorry.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.465
{\an3}No, no, we're gonna
fight this in court, Toby.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.842
{\an3}We're gonna sue them
for unlawful detention!

18:13.926 --> 18:16.887
{\an1}A national security letter
can't be challenged in court.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.765
Really?

18:20.891 --> 18:23.185
I lied for my government
under oath...

18:23.268 --> 18:26.480
and this is how they repay
my so-called patriotism?

18:26.563 --> 18:28.565
By taking my son?

18:28.649 --> 18:31.401
Ethan is more than a robot--
we all know that--

18:31.485 --> 18:35.656
but in the eyes of the law
and the powers that be...

18:35.739 --> 18:37.741
he's still not human.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.203
He's more human...

18:41.286 --> 18:43.872
than any one of those asses.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.041
MOLLY (crying):
No.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.502
(door opens, shuts)

18:51.630 --> 18:54.091
This isn't over.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.722
Where are you taking me?

19:00.806 --> 19:02.724
Will I see my mom and dad again?

19:02.808 --> 19:03.809
Quiet, robot.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.737
OFFICER (over speaker):
Team leader,

19:15.821 --> 19:17.030
stand by for transfer details.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.742
(electricity whirrs, crackles)

19:23.370 --> 19:24.538
MARSHAL: Hey!
Help!

19:28.166 --> 19:29.710
Help!

19:31.670 --> 19:33.088
Help!

19:37.217 --> 19:39.720
Hello, Rabbit.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.293
(birds chirping outside)

20:25.766 --> 20:27.935
(electronic bell chimes,
doors hiss)

20:31.188 --> 20:33.106
I'm sorry, sir--
this area's off-limits.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.318
{\an5}I'm Dr. John Woods,
and this is my lab.
I know who you are,

20:36.401 --> 20:38.487
{\an1}and you no longer have
authorized access.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.072
We'll see about that.

20:40.155 --> 20:44.326
{\an3}I <i> will</i> forcibly remove
you if need be, sir.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.286
John.
Julie.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.830
{\an3}Thank God you're here.
They-They've locked us out.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.874
{\an3}They took Ethan
last night.

20:50.958 --> 20:54.086
Okay, let's not talk
about it here. Okay?

20:58.006 --> 21:00.175
This is a nightmare.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.719
We need to get hold
of Ethan's hard drives

21:02.803 --> 21:04.513
before they're destroyed.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.224
Molly's devastated about him.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.686
And us.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.355
{\an5}I'm sorry she had to
find out that way.
(heavy sigh)

21:13.438 --> 21:15.357
{\an3}Listen, there's something
I need to tell you,

21:15.440 --> 21:17.567
{\an3}and I want you to listen
before you react.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.194
Okay?

21:19.278 --> 21:22.656
{\an3}HomeSec contacted me and
asked me to run a few tests.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.825
What kind of tests?
To see if Humanichs

21:24.908 --> 21:28.036
{\an3}could quickly be
adapted for...

21:28.120 --> 21:29.997
defense purposes.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.374
Well, that's-that's absurd.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.544
It would take years
for a Humanich to mature enough

21:35.627 --> 21:39.131
to handle morally ambiguous
situations like combat.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.096
You're going to bypass
the protocols.

21:46.179 --> 21:49.599
It's for a good cause, John--
defending our country.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.852
We've seen firsthand
the threats that are

21:51.935 --> 21:53.854
out there.
That's how they convinced you?

21:53.937 --> 21:55.272
Service to country?

21:57.149 --> 22:00.318
Julie, this is not patriotic.
This is insane.

22:04.114 --> 22:07.367
{\an3}I swore I'd never
let this happen again.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.036
I invented the protocols

22:09.119 --> 22:11.371
{\an3}so that Humanichs have time
to learn right from wrong

22:11.455 --> 22:14.082
{\an3}through exposure and
experience-- it's crucial.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.543
{\an3}To bypass the
protocols is crazy.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.295
{\an3}Worse, it would
be dangerous.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.088
Don't you understand?

22:20.172 --> 22:22.591
If it's not you or me,
it's someone else,

22:22.674 --> 22:25.093
and I'm not gonna sit around
and have somebody come in

22:25.177 --> 22:26.428
and take over our life's work.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.764
{\an1}Maybe this is all happening
for a reason.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.766
If you could just be
a little bit more open-minded,

22:30.849 --> 22:34.394
we could resume our...

22:34.478 --> 22:36.605
our life...

22:36.688 --> 22:37.731
{\an1}and our work
and our family,

22:37.814 --> 22:39.399
together.

22:39.483 --> 22:43.487
Julie, we don't have
a life together.

22:44.988 --> 22:47.616
(sighs)
I'm gonna find Ethan,

22:47.699 --> 22:48.909
and I'm gonna shut

22:48.992 --> 22:50.243
this thing down.

22:55.499 --> 22:56.917
(phone keypad beeps and blips)

23:01.671 --> 23:03.423
It's Julie.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.596
I think I may have
just really screwed up.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.640
(thunder rumbling)

23:17.062 --> 23:18.647
(electronic chime)

23:18.730 --> 23:20.816
GINA: Molly, you have
an incoming call from John.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.901
Decline.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.841
(electronic chime)

23:45.924 --> 23:48.552
Molly, you have
an incoming call from John.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.846
Molly, please pick up.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.848
Molly...

23:52.931 --> 23:56.184
I'm sorry
for the pain I've caused,

23:56.268 --> 24:00.188
but I have
to tell you something.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.482
I'm going to call Der...

24:02.566 --> 24:04.526
(car whirrs, powering down)

24:04.609 --> 24:07.612
(whirring stops)

24:09.072 --> 24:11.533
Marko, is there
a technical problem?

24:11.616 --> 24:13.702
MARKO: No, John, just waiting
for the light to change.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.537
We've stopped on train tracks.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.746
(crossing bell clanging)
No, John,

24:16.830 --> 24:19.040
we're 20 feet
from the train tracks.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.877
What...?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.712
(train horn blaring)
Marko, switch to manual drive.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.338
Manual drive is offline.
Marko!

24:25.422 --> 24:27.340
Unlock the door!

24:27.424 --> 24:29.885
{\an5}(train horn blaring)
The door is locked, John,
for your safety.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.554
Override
the safeties, damn it!

24:32.637 --> 24:35.724
Unlock the... door!

24:42.981 --> 24:46.943
{\an5}MED BOT:
Molly Woods, your meds
are being dispensed.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.572
WOMAN:
<i>Dr. Woods, the purpose</i>

24:50.655 --> 24:52.574
of this review is
to determine whether,

24:52.657 --> 24:54.576
following a court-mandated
90-day psych hold,

24:54.659 --> 24:56.411
you are ready to be released.

24:56.494 --> 24:59.623
It's been six months
since your husband passed away.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.958
How's your time been
at our recovery center?

25:02.042 --> 25:03.585
Extremely healing.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.587
I am really gonna
miss this place.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.965
Molly, we're concerned that
you haven't fully come to terms

25:09.049 --> 25:10.675
with the events of last summer.

25:10.759 --> 25:13.470
I have. All better.

25:13.553 --> 25:16.556
Several drunk and disorderlies.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.935
Well, I call that a good time
but... whatever.

25:21.519 --> 25:24.773
{\an3}Burning down your house.
Not the whole house.

25:24.856 --> 25:27.067
And I have learned my lesson
about playing with matches.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.653
{\an3}Never do that
when you're angry.

25:29.736 --> 25:32.781
Attacking a Ms. Julie Gelineau
with a shovel.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.741
Well, she screwed my husband

25:34.824 --> 25:36.618
and then had the nerve
to show up to his funeral.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.245
Now, I think

25:38.328 --> 25:40.538
I should be committed
if I didn't smack her.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.667
Molly, we know this has been

25:43.750 --> 25:45.835
a profoundly
difficult year for you.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.255
We think you're
not quite ready for reentry.

25:48.338 --> 25:51.758
Oh. Okay, now I get it.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.635
This isn't a fair hearing.

25:53.718 --> 25:57.138
This is putting a rubber stamp
to keep me in a rubber room.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.431
{\an3}Now, I've done
every single thing

25:58.515 --> 25:59.975
you people have
asked me to do.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.184
I've been a good little girl.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.602
I've taken all my meds.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.187
I've done your-your VR therapy.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.147
And you're still not
gonna let me out.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.691
Which begs the obvious question:

26:07.774 --> 26:09.943
Why does the government want
to shut me up

26:10.026 --> 26:12.821
{\an6}so badly?
You believe the government
is the reason you're here?

26:12.904 --> 26:14.281
I do.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.573
Sam Barton,

26:15.657 --> 26:16.950
{\an1}your friend and physician,
testified

26:17.033 --> 26:19.286
that she was concerned
about your mental health.

26:19.369 --> 26:20.662
Sam Barton? Please!

26:20.745 --> 26:23.039
She'd say anything
to save her own ass.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.334
She confirmed
you had abnormal brain scans

26:26.418 --> 26:27.669
{\an1}upon returning
from your mission.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.671
Now, we know
extended time in space

26:29.754 --> 26:31.381
can do something to the brain...
Liars.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.383
You're all a bunch of liars!

26:33.466 --> 26:36.469
It's the board's recommendation
that we extend your hold

26:36.553 --> 26:38.805
{\an1}and reevaluate
in 30 days--

26:38.888 --> 26:40.348
that you still pose
a serious threat of harm

26:40.432 --> 26:42.392
to self and others.
That's ridiculous!

26:42.475 --> 26:43.685
I am not a threat

26:43.768 --> 26:45.020
{\an3}and you know it.
This is a cover-up!

26:45.103 --> 26:47.314
That's what this is!
It's a cover-up!

26:47.397 --> 26:48.982

36:56.380 --> 36:58.466
{\an1}Please!

36:58.549 --> 37:01.302
Okay... your victim

37:01.385 --> 37:03.304
was pregnant.

37:03.387 --> 37:06.474
{\an3}Preliminary autopsy scans
didn't mention a pregnancy.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.476
(door opens)

37:08.559 --> 37:09.727
Hello, Molly.

37:09.810 --> 37:11.812
She's all yours.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.025
Check the scans.
She was pregnant...

37:16.108 --> 37:19.445
{\an1}and the other two ladies were
pregnant, too-- check it.

37:19.528 --> 37:20.529
DAVE: Steal my phone

37:20.613 --> 37:22.698
<i>and</i> my car?
Let go of me!

37:22.782 --> 37:23.908
{\an3}DAVE:
Come on, let's move!

37:23.991 --> 37:24.992
(door slams)

37:50.393 --> 37:51.894
Hmm...

37:55.648 --> 37:56.899
(pills rattling)

38:06.158 --> 38:07.660
Sweetie, I'm home.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.412
HANK:
Hello, Julie.

38:09.495 --> 38:11.247
Hi, Hank. Where is he?

38:11.330 --> 38:13.374
In the den.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.508
I brought home some pizza.

38:22.591 --> 38:24.427
No, thanks.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.681
Well, you have to eat something.

38:28.764 --> 38:32.393
When am I going home, Julie?

38:34.478 --> 38:37.064
We talked about this.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.691
This is your home now.

38:54.665 --> 38:58.002
(beep, door unlocks)

38:58.085 --> 38:59.795
How you feeling, Molly?

39:02.548 --> 39:04.425
(beep, latch clacks)

39:04.508 --> 39:06.093
14 days before
my performance review.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.220
You screwed me.

39:15.478 --> 39:16.937
Would've been
a seven percent pay raise--

39:17.021 --> 39:20.149
roughly 15K a year
after taxes.

39:20.232 --> 39:21.942
Okay, well...

39:22.026 --> 39:23.444
I'll talk to 'em...

39:23.527 --> 39:25.863
tell 'em what I did.

39:27.656 --> 39:29.784
It's time for that rain check.
No.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.452
{\an3}No, no, no.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.746
{\an1}(beep, door unlocks)
Dave!

39:33.829 --> 39:35.331
What?

39:35.414 --> 39:37.583
Dr. Woods, you have a visitor.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.668
Get dressed, please.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.798
See you around, Molly.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.139
WOMAN:
<i>I'm afraid I don't understand.</i>

39:52.223 --> 39:55.976
That's a court order--
pretty straightforward.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.979
And she's a material witness
in a homicide investigation.

39:59.063 --> 40:02.191
I'm not sure you grasp the
gravity of Ms. Wood's condition.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.610
{\an1}I'm not gonna ask her
to operate heavy machinery.

40:04.693 --> 40:06.445
(sighs heavily)
You do realize...

40:06.529 --> 40:08.405
that you are taking
an unstable woman into custody.

40:08.489 --> 40:11.659
She's an arsonist,
escape artist,

40:11.742 --> 40:13.077
prone to violent outbursts.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.787
Sounds like my ex-wife.

40:16.288 --> 40:17.998
{\an3}Well, she's on
a prescriptive schedule

40:18.082 --> 40:19.875
{\an3}that'll require
strict supervision.

40:20.876 --> 40:21.794
You got it.

40:21.877 --> 40:22.837
Blues at 10:00,

40:22.920 --> 40:23.963
reds at 7:00.

40:24.046 --> 40:25.840
{\an1}I'll have her back
in 72 hours,

40:25.923 --> 40:28.175
no worse for the wear.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.970
Molly Woods. After you.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.057
{\an1}I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.852
{\an3}JD Richter.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.855
{\an1}How'd you pull
this one off, JD Richter?

40:40.938 --> 40:44.358
{\an3}Well, let's just say a judge
owed me a favor or three.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.110
So look what I found.

40:46.193 --> 40:49.071
{\an3}Prenatal vitamins.
In her medicine cabinet.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.365
Ooh, now, that's
a hell of a clue.

40:51.448 --> 40:53.742
{\an3}Yeah. How'd you know
she was pregnant?

40:53.826 --> 40:55.703
Did you know her?

40:55.786 --> 40:57.079
{\an1}Look, there's something
much more important

40:57.163 --> 40:58.497
going on than this, okay?

40:58.581 --> 41:00.499
{\an1}The government
is trying to shut me up.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.001
All right, wait a second.

41:02.084 --> 41:04.712
We are ten feet from the
rubber squad, Condor, all right?

41:04.795 --> 41:06.922
Let's just skip the
conspiracy theories.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.841
I'm guessing this thing
is yours, huh?

41:08.924 --> 41:10.217
Yeah.

41:11.635 --> 41:13.888
Okay.

41:13.971 --> 41:17.099
And listen, you know, you don't
have to worry about me.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.894
I'm stable, sane,
and completely clear-headed.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.730
Well, that's good,
you're the only lead I got.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.815
Give me a sec.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.823
Thanks for the ride, Dave.

41:32.907 --> 41:33.949
(grunts)

41:38.287 --> 41:39.246
You are crazy.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.706
Maybe a little.

41:40.789 --> 41:42.041
But crazy's all you got.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.421
{\an1}DAVE: Hey!

41:47.504 --> 41:49.256
Drive fast.
(engine starts)

41:49.340 --> 41:51.634
{\an1}DAVE: What did you
do to my car?!

41:51.717 --> 41:54.303
(engine revs, tires screech)

41:54.386 --> 41:55.930
RICHTER:
<i>You want to tell me</i>

41:56.013 --> 41:57.431
what the hell this is about?

41:58.724 --> 42:01.769
{\an1}This isn't
a murder investigation.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.980
It's an invasion.

42:06.565 --> 42:08.609
(dance music playing)

42:12.988 --> 42:15.115
(woman laughing)

42:15.199 --> 42:17.159
♪ ♪

42:28.963 --> 42:29.922
{\an3}Technology.

42:30.005 --> 42:32.258
All it does is separate us.

42:32.341 --> 42:34.051

42:34.134 --> 42:36.136
Sure.
