01:04.730 --> 01:06.574
Gregory!

01:07.651 --> 01:10.245
Gregory!

01:11.822 --> 01:13.495
Have mercy.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.493
Release me.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.834
Gregory!

01:20.163 --> 01:21.710
Come back!

01:22.332 --> 01:24.300
Gregory!

02:05.709 --> 02:10.384
My power returns with
the rise of the blood moon.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.718
Hell awakens.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.843
Is Master Gregory here?

02:57.427 --> 02:58.770
Partially.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.199
Master Gregory,
do you not hear the bells?

03:10.982 --> 03:13.701
There is a ringing
in my ear.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.780
In the village,
in the old church,

03:16.863 --> 03:19.491
there is a child no
more than 10 years of age.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.498
She is

03:22.285 --> 03:23.286
infected.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.214
You may note
I am presently

03:26.289 --> 03:29.338
not dealing with
the otherworldly.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.766
On your feet, sir.
It seems you're
requested for duty.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.515
My only oath
is to this stool.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.730
It is an oath
I intend not to break.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.849
The mark on your hand
tells me you're a knight.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.022
Have you no honor?

03:46.143 --> 03:48.487
This man says
an innocent is at risk.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.276
And you do nothing?

03:50.355 --> 03:54.360
On the contrary,
I'm doing my best
to ignore him.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.237
I beg of you,
do not do this.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.743
Don't worry, boy.
This won't be an execution,

03:59.823 --> 04:01.325
merely an education.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.041
Fill it.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.089
I was begging
for your life.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.555
Not his.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.947
The trick is not
defeating him with a cup.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.701
The trick is
not to spill.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.333
Thank you.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.880
Mr. Bradley,
why did you not tell me
the bells were ringing?

04:48.330 --> 04:50.378
Apologies, Master.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.227
Come!

05:10.936 --> 05:12.279
Quickly!

05:14.231 --> 05:15.483
Hatchet.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.526
Silverbane.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.537
Longbow.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.578
We'll need
the silver net.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.424
Please, save her.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.555
Nothing else
would hold her.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.768
How long
has she been like this?

05:42.843 --> 05:44.345
Since last evening.

05:49.641 --> 05:50.938
Come to me.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.443
Come to me.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.528
You must have known when
you put me in that hole

06:00.652 --> 06:03.656
you couldn't hold
me there forever.

06:04.739 --> 06:05.786
Gregory.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.372
If it is really you,
then show yourself.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.130
Leave this innocent child!

06:41.318 --> 06:43.537
Mummy, what happened?

06:46.156 --> 06:47.328
God bless you.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.511
Did you miss me?

07:11.097 --> 07:13.099
You have, haven't you?

07:13.224 --> 07:17.024
Don't try to deny it.
I can see into your soul.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.199
Oh.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.864
A boy!

07:24.861 --> 07:26.204
I like boys.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.743
Shut your eyes!

07:27.864 --> 07:29.241
Come here, boy.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.210
- Do not be in awe of her.
- It will only empower her.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.381
William!

07:41.378 --> 07:43.551
You know something,
Gregory?

07:44.547 --> 07:46.140
I missed you too.

07:48.843 --> 07:49.969
Now!

07:58.687 --> 08:00.030
Shoot!

08:03.024 --> 08:04.367
Net!

08:06.569 --> 08:08.196
Well done, William!

08:28.341 --> 08:29.684
We will work together.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.357
Let the silver
do its work!

08:37.851 --> 08:40.070
Can you feel it?
She's weakening!

08:44.941 --> 08:46.614
Fine work, William!

08:56.119 --> 08:57.666
Now!

09:09.841 --> 09:10.967
I'm sorry, Master.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.232
Master Gregory!

09:18.349 --> 09:19.817
Don't expect
sympathy from him.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.236
His heart
is blacker than mine.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.157
You are with me now.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.031
Let him go!

09:32.155 --> 09:34.249
- I can feel the dark.
- No!

09:34.449 --> 09:35.541
I can't stand it!

09:35.658 --> 09:37.501
Let him go!
I will burn you!

09:37.619 --> 09:40.498
Master Gregory!

09:40.580 --> 09:42.799
Master Gregory!

09:42.874 --> 09:45.502
Master Gregory!

09:45.668 --> 09:47.762
Time has made me stronger.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.181
I am no longer
<i>as</i> easy to contain.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.738
Ten damn years wasted.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.503
I'm coming for you, Malkin!

10:23.915 --> 10:27.089
I am coming for you!

10:54.737 --> 10:56.080
Tom!

10:58.825 --> 11:00.202
What is it, Cate?

11:00.285 --> 11:03.414
You're supposed to be
minding the pigs.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.835
You've never hit one.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.549
No.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.217
But I'm getting closer.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.344
You're not a hunter, Tom.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.644
I'm not destined to spend the
rest of my life feeding pigs.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.351
I'm going to get
out of here, Cate.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.935
I'm going to leave
this place soon. I just...

11:26.936 --> 11:27.937
I know it.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.776
Tom, you're shaking!

11:34.569 --> 11:36.037
Go and get Mam, Cate.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.576
Go!

11:37.614 --> 11:40.618
Mam!
It's happening again!

11:45.747 --> 11:47.749
Tom. Tom.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.463
Now...

11:54.255 --> 11:58.635
Go catch those pigs,
or your father will
have you for dinner.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.430
Yes, Mam.
Go on.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.569
The Ward residence?

12:50.895 --> 12:51.896
Who's asking?

12:52.855 --> 12:54.983
I understand
there's a seventh son

12:55.066 --> 12:57.160
of a seventh son
that lives here.

12:57.860 --> 13:02.036
Do not say there is not,
for I know that there is.
I'm in a hurry.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.044
Bit hungry as well.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.517
My compliments
to the cook!

13:22.218 --> 13:23.720
You're welcome.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.099
So,

13:30.852 --> 13:32.320
which one is the seventh?

13:50.747 --> 13:52.749
What is your name, boy?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.210
Thomas Ward.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.843
He's strong.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.394
He does a lot of
work around the farm.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.897
So, the dealing
has begun.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.247
That's the man.
From my visions.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.453
It's too dangerous.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.165
He's a Spook.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.840
'Tis a noble profession.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.928
And your last apprentice?
And the one before him?

14:39.003 --> 14:40.801
What happened to them?

14:41.756 --> 14:44.054
And now you
come here for my son?

14:44.133 --> 14:45.680
I'm supposed
to go with him.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.358
He is a bit scrawny
for a seventh son.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.169
I dreaded the
thought of this day

15:21.379 --> 15:23.177
but I knew
it would come.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.555
Then you understand.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.563
I know you better than
you think I do, Tom.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.400
Be wise.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.488
Be careful.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.829
Remember,

15:48.614 --> 15:51.163
all you ever need
is inside you.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.291
Just don't be
afraid to look.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.053
Your pendant.
No, I can't...

16:03.546 --> 16:04.889
Wear it.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.391
Always.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.409
Keep him safe!

16:27.069 --> 16:31.495
Alas, good lady,
that is a vow
I cannot make.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.826
My Queen.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.288
At last,
you have returned.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.839
The Spook, what has
he done to you?

17:22.083 --> 17:24.882
Not just me.
All of us.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.009
Burned.
Starved.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.466
And forced into hiding.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.271
The Spook has no mercy.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.654
My spy follows him.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.873
You needn't fear
Gregory any longer,

17:54.740 --> 17:57.744
my beautiful sister.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.830
Thank you, My Queen.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.844
Make way!
Make way!

19:19.241 --> 19:23.667
It is near impossible to
battle demons with wet feet.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.293
Here.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.593
This is to get
your boots fixed.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.754
I will pick up
provisions.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.839
Provisions.
Liquids.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.096
Needed to ward
off evil spirits.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.435
Fermented liquids?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.559
Lest I forget,

19:40.638 --> 19:43.016
pick up grease, salt,
flour and bacon.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.197
I'm starting to wish
I was a sixth son.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.538
Burn the witch!

20:02.159 --> 20:03.661
Burn the witch!

20:18.759 --> 20:21.137
Wait!

20:21.637 --> 20:24.015
If she's a witch,
then I'll deal with her.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.558
And who are you?

20:27.685 --> 20:29.528
I am Master Gregory's
apprentice.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.489
It's true.
I saw the Spook
going into the tavern.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.318
And in my expert opinion

20:38.028 --> 20:39.780
she is extremely
dangerous.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.954
Shall we fetch your master?
No!

20:43.075 --> 20:45.578
No, I can take her
away and dispose of her.

20:46.704 --> 20:49.082
But I'll need salt,
flour and grease!

20:49.165 --> 20:50.417
Go!

20:51.292 --> 20:53.590
And throw in some
bacon as payment!

21:02.178 --> 21:05.182
So what are you
going to do with me,
Mr. Apprentice?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.016
I'm not sure yet.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.772
You don't believe
I'm a witch?

21:08.851 --> 21:10.603
You don't look
like a witch.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.360
Do you really think you'll
make it as a Spook?

21:14.732 --> 21:15.858
That's the idea.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.869
You seem too nice.

21:29.747 --> 21:33.172
You know that all of his apprentices
were killed, don't you?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.212
What's your name?

21:39.131 --> 21:40.553
Tom! What's yours?

21:40.966 --> 21:42.639
I'll tell you next time.
Whoa!

21:43.969 --> 21:45.312
Next time?

21:45.888 --> 21:47.435
I read fortunes.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.812
We will meet again.

21:50.226 --> 21:52.103
Just don't tell
your master about me.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.438
Why not?

21:56.482 --> 21:58.155
You don't like secrets?

22:00.569 --> 22:01.912
Close your eyes.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.074
Why?

22:07.284 --> 22:09.503
Just close your eyes.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.014
Mother?

23:12.308 --> 23:13.981
Yes, it's me.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.940
How is it possible?
You look...

23:16.020 --> 23:17.738
Is this your daughter?

23:22.735 --> 23:26.706
Are you a loyal girl?
Like your mother?

23:28.073 --> 23:30.952
So this is your spy
that follows Gregory.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.792
I like your shoes.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.252
Mmm.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.925
Human father.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.971
Lizzie, you surprise me.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.523
Help yourself to the
blood cakes, little one.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.525
They give you strength.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.899
Soon the blood
moon will be full.

24:01.982 --> 24:05.282
And <i>as</i> it grows stronger,
so do all of us.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.454
We must call the others.

24:08.030 --> 24:11.159
Pendle Mountain welcomes you,
brothers and sisters.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.744
Your queen has returned.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.851
Do not dally,
Mr. Ward.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.355
What kind of forest
is this?

24:34.139 --> 24:37.734
When you address me,
address me as Master Gregory.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.319
So, Master Gregory, if...

24:42.564 --> 24:44.157
If I'm your
new apprentice,

24:44.233 --> 24:45.576
what happened
to the old one?

24:45.651 --> 24:49.201
Wrong question.
Wrong questions get wrong answers.

24:50.406 --> 24:51.407
So he's dead.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.756
It is just a ghast.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.963
Level six creature.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.507
These woods are
filled with them.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.385
Try not to upset it.
It should leave you alone.

25:16.598 --> 25:20.603
What do you know of
what a Spook actually does?

25:22.104 --> 25:23.105
Uh...

25:24.189 --> 25:26.032
You kill creatures
of the dark.

25:26.567 --> 25:30.538
Your answer,
it fills me with confidence.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.497
We tend the creatures
of the dark.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.587
Some are less harmful,
such as ghasts.

25:38.662 --> 25:43.589
The most dangerous,
such as witches,
we trap or kill.

25:44.126 --> 25:47.050
My last apprentice
wrote this all down.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.131
Yeah. And he's dead.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.398
I'm just saying maybe he
didn't do everything right.

25:57.473 --> 26:00.477
William Bradley was the finest
apprentice I've ever had.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.778
He died at the hands
of Mother Malkin.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.397
The witch queen?

26:05.230 --> 26:06.470
I thought she was
just a legend.

26:06.482 --> 26:10.658
You live in a world now where
legend and nightmare are real!

26:11.445 --> 26:13.072
Malkin is alive.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.954
We journey to her fortress
in Pendle Mountain,

26:16.033 --> 26:18.035
where she no doubt hides.

26:19.453 --> 26:20.796
Mr. Ward.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.291
Mr. Ward!

26:23.373 --> 26:24.499
Mr. Ward!

26:32.591 --> 26:34.059
You passed out.

26:36.178 --> 26:39.307
You have spells, boy.
What kind?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.443
Sometimes

26:44.686 --> 26:45.687
I see things.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.866
Things that
haven't happened yet.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.036
Could be useful.

26:53.779 --> 26:58.034
Not the passing
out part, of course,
but the visions, perhaps.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.374
What is that?

27:05.499 --> 27:06.500
You mean who.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.544
This is Tusk.

27:09.837 --> 27:11.464
Loyal <i>as</i> he is ugly.

27:17.427 --> 27:19.646
These things that you
see in your visions,

27:20.681 --> 27:22.604
can you alter them
or are they fixed?

27:24.768 --> 27:26.816
I don't... I don't know.

27:27.521 --> 27:28.898
I haven't really tried.

27:30.274 --> 27:35.201
With a little help,
most of life's curses
can be a gift.

27:41.201 --> 27:45.081
There are my beauties!
Returned as I knew they would.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.382
Tend to them, Tusk.

27:55.591 --> 27:56.843
What is this place?

27:56.925 --> 27:58.768
Home sweet home.

28:03.599 --> 28:05.317
This is incredible.

28:07.603 --> 28:11.073
We must arm ourselves for the
journey to Pendle Mountain.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.446
Come, Mr. Ward.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.621
"The Falcons:

28:25.704 --> 28:28.127
"an order of noble knights

28:28.290 --> 28:31.089
"dedicated to combatting
the forces of darkness

28:31.210 --> 28:34.259
"and responsible for passing
their knowledge and skills

28:34.338 --> 28:36.807
"to other seventh
sons of seventh sons."

28:39.635 --> 28:42.013
It says here that there
are a thousand of you.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.644
That is a very old tapestry.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.979
They all died or were
turned to darkness.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.821
When you deal with dark,

28:55.817 --> 28:57.319
dark gets in you.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.448
So, you're
the only one left?

29:09.164 --> 29:11.917
So you're
the only one left,
Master Gregory.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.805
Thank you for
reminding me.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.014
How long is this apprenticeship
supposed to last?

29:25.097 --> 29:26.314
Ten years

29:27.474 --> 29:29.647
for my last apprentice.

29:30.310 --> 29:33.735
But with you,
I have less than one week.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.698
Why so short?

29:35.774 --> 29:38.118
That is when the blood
moon will be full.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.196
Happens once a century.

29:41.863 --> 29:45.538
The last time, it was
followed by years of war.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.124
Witches laid
waste to cities.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.376
The world is
still recovering.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.717
If we do not
stop Mother Malkin

29:54.793 --> 29:57.717
before the next
red moon sets...

29:57.838 --> 30:01.058
How can we possibly...
Enough.
No more questions.

30:01.174 --> 30:04.553
We leave at dawn.
Stay in your chamber.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.644
Master Gregory,
if you want me to learn,
you have to explain things.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.067
No time. We must
get to Pendle Mountain

30:10.142 --> 30:12.736
before Malkin
assembles her minions.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.905
There are witches
that need killing.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.157
Fucking witches.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.753
Help me.

30:40.422 --> 30:44.302
Help me.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.073
Help!

33:01.438 --> 33:04.191
You were told to
stay in your chamber!

33:05.567 --> 33:08.070
That was your first
test, Mr. Ward.

33:08.195 --> 33:10.539
And not surprisingly,
you failed!

33:13.074 --> 33:14.792
Test number two.

33:14.868 --> 33:19.294
The Rowan staff.
Carved by the very
first Falcon Knight.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.584
The finest
fighting staff there is.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.504
Master it

33:25.629 --> 33:27.802
and you can master
any weapon.

33:30.800 --> 33:31.972
Show me what you are!

33:33.803 --> 33:35.680
I paid good
money for you.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.358
I think your father
deceived me of your worth.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.441
Are you not the seventh son
of a seventh son?

33:43.271 --> 33:45.740
You ought to be seven times
as strong as a normal man!

33:46.858 --> 33:48.576
Your mam,

33:48.693 --> 33:52.539
she did not put up much of a
fight to keep you, did she?

34:05.293 --> 34:06.966
You are worthless!

34:07.087 --> 34:09.931
There is not enough time.
You'll be dead in a week.

34:17.514 --> 34:18.811
Good aim.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.143
I was aiming
for your head.

34:23.311 --> 34:24.527
Missed.

34:25.730 --> 34:26.982
Teach me.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.985
Please.

34:35.031 --> 34:38.034
With the blood moon's rise
and Malkin's arrival,

34:38.493 --> 34:41.212
the creatures of the dark
will be more frequent

34:42.163 --> 34:43.710
and more powerful.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.672
These are her lieutenants.

34:46.793 --> 34:50.138
This is Radu.
He has an army of assassins.

34:56.803 --> 34:57.804
Throw the knife.

35:01.808 --> 35:02.980
Go on!

35:08.690 --> 35:11.409
Salt and iron.
They are crucial.

35:12.485 --> 35:14.032
Salt burns.
Iron bleeds away

35:14.154 --> 35:15.872
the strength of any
creature of the dark.

35:15.989 --> 35:19.038
Tincture of copper,
for flesh wounds.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.833
Silverbane,
repels witches.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.175
Ogre scrotum,
for your own enjoyment.
Follow.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.672
Stone Chuckers are not to be
confused with Cattle Rippers.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.556
What's the difference?

35:33.965 --> 35:37.720
Stone Chuckers chuck stones.
Cattle Rippers rip cattle.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.473
The names are
fairly self-evident.

35:53.401 --> 35:56.075
Verbanum,
guards against spells.

35:57.781 --> 36:00.500
That is disgusting.
What does that kill?

36:01.326 --> 36:02.418
Cowardice.

36:02.952 --> 36:05.455
Sarikin.
Takes the form of a leopard.

36:05.580 --> 36:08.459
Virahadra is
the king of swords.

36:14.881 --> 36:18.135
Your consistency
is admirable, Mr. Ward.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.229
Of all of them

36:22.305 --> 36:24.478
Malkin is the strongest.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.067
She is the queen.

36:26.601 --> 36:30.196
You know what?
I've seen Mother
Malkin in my visions.

36:31.481 --> 36:35.031
It's going to take a lot more
than salt and iron to defeat her.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.121
You leave Malkin to me.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.499
Continue your studies.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.640
My Queen!

37:04.013 --> 37:07.563
A gift,
to commemorate
your return.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.816
My finest assassins.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.481
Radu,

37:13.189 --> 37:15.317
you spoil me.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.695
But you must keep
your gifts.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.451
You will need them
more than I.

37:20.530 --> 37:21.827
Have you forgotten?

37:22.866 --> 37:25.210
There are Spooks buried
all over this mountain

37:25.285 --> 37:27.003
who thought they
could slay me.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.793
When the blood
moon is full,

37:29.873 --> 37:31.341
Gregory will be next.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.351
Did you look at me?

37:51.478 --> 37:54.482
Never,
never look at me.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.664
Your finest assassins?

38:05.366 --> 38:06.743
You may keep them.

38:13.875 --> 38:14.922
Mother.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.970
She's dangerous.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.093
She's my sister.

38:21.341 --> 38:23.093
She healed me, Alice.

38:24.594 --> 38:26.813
By the time
the moon is full,

38:26.888 --> 38:28.515
she will rule this land.

38:29.224 --> 38:31.318
And we will be there
by her side.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.779
No more hiding from men.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.732
No more fearing them.

38:37.232 --> 38:38.404
Right.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.323
Just fearing her.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.789
I would never
let her hurt you.

38:50.286 --> 38:53.631
And now go, and keep
an eye on that Spook.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.018
What are you doing here?

39:49.387 --> 39:52.015
Swimming in the moonlight.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.647
Turn around.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.302
What was that?

40:27.383 --> 40:30.603
It is said that when a witch
first touches by moonlight

40:30.678 --> 40:33.682
the man with whom she's
meant to walk hand in hand,

40:35.475 --> 40:37.477
there is a blue spark.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.151
So you are a witch.

40:42.774 --> 40:46.699
My father is a gypsy.
My mother is a witch.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.614
So that makes me a witch.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.500
She's all I have.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.213
We're not all evil,
you know,

41:05.380 --> 41:07.382
<i>as</i> your master
would have you believe.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.180
Some of us are good.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.934
Some are bad.

41:15.598 --> 41:18.101
And the rest are
simply unaware.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.904
And what kind are you?

41:23.606 --> 41:24.607
Mmm.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.117
So where are you headed?

41:34.450 --> 41:35.952
To Pendle Mountain.

41:37.286 --> 41:39.288
Why do you want
to be like him?

41:41.290 --> 41:42.883
He treats you
worse than a dog,

41:42.959 --> 41:45.678
calls witches abominations.

41:46.963 --> 41:48.931
Have you been
spying on us?

41:50.758 --> 41:52.101
Yes.

41:53.302 --> 41:54.349
For who?

41:55.138 --> 41:58.142
Someone who calls
people abominations.

42:08.484 --> 42:09.701
What is that?

42:11.320 --> 42:12.412
That

42:13.531 --> 42:14.908
is Tusk.

42:15.992 --> 42:18.415
He's having a bad dream
by the sounds of it.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.962
I wonder what monsters
have nightmares about?

42:24.500 --> 42:26.468
Humans, probably.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.736
Have you been writing down
what you have learned

42:43.811 --> 42:45.813
in your journal,
<i>as</i> I have instructed?

42:46.981 --> 42:48.904
I have a good
memory for facts.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.485
Do you now?

42:51.360 --> 42:54.910
Do you remember the difference
between a ghost and a ghast?

42:54.989 --> 42:56.366
A ghost is a full spirit.

42:56.449 --> 42:58.827
A ghast is a fragment of
a spirit who's moved on.

42:59.368 --> 43:00.494
Correct.

43:04.624 --> 43:06.297
Oh, Tusk!

43:07.376 --> 43:09.674
Aim, Tusk,
for God's sake.

43:13.674 --> 43:15.676
- What is that?
- The bell.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.345
I'm being summoned.

43:25.645 --> 43:28.239
Tusk! Best make
yourself scarce.

43:35.238 --> 43:36.785
Are you Gregory?

43:37.573 --> 43:39.951
That depends on
who is inquiring.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.582
You are cordially
invited to the walled city.

43:45.706 --> 43:49.802
<i>The Inquisitor has instructed
me to return you there now.</i>

43:50.545 --> 43:53.048
<i>This will cost us
two days' journey.</i>

43:54.382 --> 43:58.387
<i>If it is anything less than a
Boggart, we are on our way.</i>

43:58.594 --> 43:59.891
<i>What's a Boggart?</i>

44:00.346 --> 44:02.064
<i>You do not want to know.</i>

44:04.725 --> 44:07.729
<i>- The devil is upon us.
- There will be slaughter.</i>

44:08.020 --> 44:10.694
<i>The signs of evil
are everywhere.</i>

44:10.815 --> 44:12.692
And now we have this beast,

44:12.817 --> 44:14.990
unlike anything
we've seen before.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.163
No priest dares
go near it.

44:17.738 --> 44:21.288
I thought perhaps you
might better protect us.

44:21.576 --> 44:24.375
Flattery is fine.
Gold is finer.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.599
Feels a bit light.

44:36.757 --> 44:39.556
You'll get the rest
when the job is done.

44:46.601 --> 44:47.944
Ah!

44:48.936 --> 44:50.188
Of course.

44:51.606 --> 44:54.780
Malkin's most
bloodthirsty lieutenant.

44:54.942 --> 44:58.287
He has killed more of
my kind than all of
the rest put together.

44:58.362 --> 44:59.739
His name is Urag.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.621
It took three regiments
to secure the creature.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.627
I was the only one
to survive.

45:08.748 --> 45:10.091
Leave us.

45:11.292 --> 45:12.544
Secure the doors!

45:34.440 --> 45:36.033
I fight him alone.

45:37.235 --> 45:38.452
Why?

45:38.527 --> 45:39.653
Ancient code of honor.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.373
More importantly,

45:43.491 --> 45:45.619
I prefer not to
split the reward.

45:56.462 --> 45:57.805
Ha!

46:10.476 --> 46:13.525
You've chosen the
wrong profession, boy.

46:30.371 --> 46:31.714
Ha!

46:59.567 --> 47:02.241
The cage!
Grab onto the cage!

47:09.535 --> 47:10.752
Jump!

47:32.475 --> 47:34.102
Silverbane!

47:56.082 --> 47:58.460
We are not finished. Oil!

47:59.460 --> 48:01.087
We must kill him
for good.

48:02.630 --> 48:03.973
Move the cauldrons!

48:14.183 --> 48:15.605
Do it.

48:17.478 --> 48:19.480
Unless you prefer
to eat his heart.

48:40.584 --> 48:42.006
I can't do this.

48:46.841 --> 48:48.514
I'm not like you.

48:49.885 --> 48:51.353
Not yet.

48:57.059 --> 48:59.278
But you will be!

49:06.235 --> 49:09.409
Get back.
All of you, move back!

49:10.823 --> 49:12.496
Clear them off!

49:30.926 --> 49:33.679
I am training you
to kill witches!

49:33.846 --> 49:36.816
If you cannot do that,
you are useless to me!

49:40.269 --> 49:43.068
Yes, that's right,
go sulk, boy!

50:03.918 --> 50:05.261
Halt!

50:24.396 --> 50:26.023
My Queen.
Sarikin.

50:29.109 --> 50:32.283
Virahadra,
king of swords.

50:32.821 --> 50:36.792
Strix, my brave warlock.

50:40.162 --> 50:43.166
Good. Now all are
here but Urag.

50:43.749 --> 50:44.921
Where is he?

50:56.387 --> 50:57.479
Where is your master?

51:02.768 --> 51:04.315
What's wrong?

51:09.483 --> 51:11.156
I can't do
what he does.

51:13.153 --> 51:14.325
Good.

51:15.656 --> 51:16.828
Is it?

51:17.491 --> 51:20.995
To be no good at
something bad is good.

51:21.537 --> 51:23.335
It's not that simple.

51:37.344 --> 51:40.689
I looked it up in an old spell
book about the blue spark.

51:41.682 --> 51:43.855
Sometimes
it's about destiny.

51:44.351 --> 51:48.527
Sometimes it's just
dust on a witch's fingers.

51:50.691 --> 51:53.035
So it didn't
mean anything.

51:58.824 --> 52:01.703
Your master was in love
with a witch once.

52:01.827 --> 52:04.376
When he was very young.

52:05.706 --> 52:07.174
We all have secrets.

52:07.750 --> 52:08.967
What's yours?

52:12.463 --> 52:13.464
Close your eyes.

52:24.850 --> 52:26.523
Close your eyes.

52:57.675 --> 52:59.723
I want to
stay here forever.

53:02.930 --> 53:05.274
A failed Spook
and a half-witch?

53:06.016 --> 53:07.438
What would we do?

53:09.937 --> 53:12.440
Well, my mother
taught me how to steal.

53:13.941 --> 53:15.989
I'm rather good at
it when I want to be.

53:17.027 --> 53:18.279
I bet you are!

53:18.779 --> 53:20.406
Don't laugh!

53:22.116 --> 53:23.914
What would you
have us do?

53:29.456 --> 53:31.458
Let me take you
away from here.

53:33.127 --> 53:34.970
Somewhere safe.
Somewhere...

53:36.463 --> 53:38.636
Somewhere none of
this even matters.

53:40.300 --> 53:41.802
That sounds nice.

53:47.141 --> 53:49.860
But there's
no place like that.

54:09.288 --> 54:11.006
I have to go back to him.

54:18.464 --> 54:20.182
I don't want to
leave you.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.900
You can't hide
from destiny.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.472
I, too, was once young.

55:10.057 --> 55:11.730
Did not listen.

55:11.892 --> 55:14.145
Was arrogant, like you.

55:17.898 --> 55:20.242
I once loved a witch.

55:22.027 --> 55:23.199
Yes.

55:23.570 --> 55:24.787
Malkin.

55:30.911 --> 55:33.255
She was not always evil.

55:34.081 --> 55:36.925
Fear and hatred
created her.

55:38.752 --> 55:42.973
She grew into what she was
perceived to be, deadly.

55:44.508 --> 55:48.183
And when she
discovered I had married,

55:51.431 --> 55:54.310
she could not
endure my happiness.

55:57.938 --> 56:01.283
She murdered my wife
in cold blood.

56:06.113 --> 56:07.615
I captured her.

56:10.242 --> 56:14.588
I was clever. Lied to her.
Told her I still loved her.

56:18.959 --> 56:22.259
I had my chance
to kill her,

56:22.337 --> 56:24.510
but I showed
her mercy instead.

56:26.133 --> 56:27.476
Tricked her.

56:28.468 --> 56:31.813
Locked her away in a cage
buried in the ground.

56:34.182 --> 56:36.981
I thought that prison would
hold her for eternity.

56:38.645 --> 56:40.238
But I was wrong.

56:42.316 --> 56:46.662
And now, everyone she kills
in her wake is my burden.

56:51.658 --> 56:55.708
I want you to meet
my wife, Mr. Ward.

56:56.496 --> 56:59.170
This is Rebecca.

57:00.667 --> 57:01.668
This

57:02.878 --> 57:05.722
is why I've been
so hard on you, Tom.

57:14.973 --> 57:17.817
Do not make
the same mistake.

57:19.353 --> 57:23.028
If you see a witch, kill it.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.698
My daughter has
spotted them.

57:27.778 --> 57:29.155
They are moving closer.

57:30.697 --> 57:34.543
You may do as you wish
with the boy, my darling.

57:35.369 --> 57:37.667
But I want Gregory

57:38.205 --> 57:40.253
alive.

57:49.174 --> 57:51.393
Beyond the forest,
Pendle Mountain.

57:51.718 --> 57:53.265
We have three days.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.233
Tusk!

57:58.392 --> 58:00.315
Dependable as death
you are!

58:00.811 --> 58:01.812
Whoa!

58:21.331 --> 58:22.503
What the hell is that?

58:22.582 --> 58:24.175
A Boggart!

58:24.251 --> 58:27.926
Subterranean beast.
Nasty temperament.
Blind as a bat.

58:28.380 --> 58:29.552
How do you fight
a Boggart?

58:29.923 --> 58:31.891
You don't!
You run!

58:56.116 --> 58:57.663
Tusk, run!

58:59.161 --> 59:00.504
Follow!

59:14.301 --> 59:15.894
I thought you said
Boggarts were blind!

59:16.011 --> 59:19.015
Their sense of smell,
extraordinary!

59:20.348 --> 59:21.600
Jump.

59:23.935 --> 59:25.278
Ahhh!

59:43.497 --> 59:45.750
We seem to be
having a Boggart problem.

59:48.001 --> 59:49.002
Much thanks.

59:55.342 --> 59:58.061
Don't worry,
we are safe now.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:02.023
Boggarts,
they hate water.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.575
Mr. Ward!

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:22.744
Mr. Ward!

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:25.254
Mr. Ward!

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:29.252
On the subject of Boggarts,
I'm beginning to find
you a tad unreliable!

01:00:58.738 --> 01:00:59.864
Tom!

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.826
Tom!

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:17.325
Alice has no place
in your thoughts.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:22.581
Your master wants to hunt us,
burn us, eat our hearts.

01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:25.788
How about I feed you
your own?

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:33.667
The stone!

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.424
It belongs to my queen!

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:37.846
How did you get it?

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.289
No, no, no.

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:08.164
Don't get up. I'm fine.

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:11.751
I'm fine.
I was just killing
this enormous, scary

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:13.673
monster thing.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:17.252
You do not die easy,
do you, Mr. Ward?

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.052
And you slayed
the unslayable.

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.710
Where did you get that?

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:56.625
My mother gave it to me.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.592
What?

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:03.932
What's funny?

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:07.932
You, Mr. Ward.

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:13.482
What is this thing?

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:16.277
That thing?
The Umbran stone!

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:20.110
The witches' most
sacred talisman.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.067
It strengthens
their powers.

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:24.820
Makes their illusions
seem more real.

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:28.281
Why would
my mam have it?

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:36.461
Mother Malkin,
she had the stone once.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.339
In her hands,
it has tremendous power.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:45.762
But it was stolen from her
by another witch.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.640
Only then was I able
to defeat her.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:51.138
To trap her.

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:56.977
Are you telling me
that my mother is a witch?

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.733
So that is what you are.

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:08.329
A witch's son who is
a Spook's apprentice.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.413
Now that's funny.

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:20.500
Hmm, must account
for your visions.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.266
Come on.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.523
We have a job to do.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.323
What
happened to Urag?

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:47.193
He burned him alive.

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:51.865
I'm sorry you
had to witness that.

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.206
The Spook is
a cruel man.

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:59.506
He would do the same to you,
if he had the chance.

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:02.835
So would that apprentice.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:04.886
Tom is good.

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:08.305
Such a shame
he will die.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:09.724
I don't want him to die!

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:13.394
We could save him.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:16.602
Tom loves you.

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:20.068
Your mother saw it
in his heart.

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:24.323
Even an Umbran stone
cannot hide such things.

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:29.322
Your mother found it

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:33.415
around Tom's neck.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:38.419
Get back what
was stolen from me

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.168
and your boy
will be spared.

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:43.758
How do I know you're
telling the truth?

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:47.011
Get it back.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:07:00.100
Let us show them
what we do

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:02.436
to cities that
burn witches.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:05.275
We will avenge
our brother's death.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:10.034
Let us give the world
a taste of what is to come.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.157
Mam?

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:55.830
What's that?

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:13.097
Hell is here!

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:54.212
Help us!

01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:47.691
I'm going back.
No!

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:48.981
Keep her safe.

01:09:54.399 --> 01:09:55.446
Mam!

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.327
Ah!

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:15.590
A witch defends the city.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.023
That witch.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:33.397
Traitorous thief.

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:40.699
You abandoned your people while
we were being destroyed.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.706
And for what?

01:10:44.532 --> 01:10:48.537
They will hate you once
they know what you are.

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:52.339
Aw...

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:57.220
You gave away the one thing
that could have saved you.

01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:00.139
And that gift

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:02.805
will be the death
of your son.

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:07.396
You are a slave
to darkness,
Mother Malkin,

01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:08.849
not its queen.

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:39.884
A little something
for the pain.

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:41.760
No.

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:44.099
Makes you more human.

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:47.728
We've lost all
our possessions,

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:49.477
but somehow
you still have that?

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:51.683
Just good luck,
I guess.

01:12:01.359 --> 01:12:04.283
You must never have more
than one sip of this a day.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:05.738
Why not?

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:07.495
Because it is mine.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.541
Ha-ha!

01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:19.218
Resilient as you
are ugly, old friend.

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:21.341
What?

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.672
What is it?

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.228
Something is wrong.

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:31.601
Stay here.
We will look ahead.

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:00.876
Come.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.633
I have to stay here.
They'll be back soon.

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:05.969
I've changed my mind.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.552
Let's run away.

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:15.809
Do you love me?

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:21.648
Yes.

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:31.782
Mr. Ward.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:34.706
Go gather wood.
We're going to have a fire.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:36.954
Tom, please.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:39.294
I said, gather wood.

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.007
Stand back, sir.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:44.929
Don't make me do this.
She's a spy.

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.215
She is not the enemy.

01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:49.392
We have a mission,
Mr. Ward.

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:52.311
This is your
most important test,

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.268
right now.

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:56.725
Don't hurt him!

01:13:58.517 --> 01:13:59.518
Run.

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:05.570
Damn it, boy!
The stone.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.193
She's stolen it.

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:09.862
Now tell me she's innocent.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:16.911
Alice!

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:56.371
I cannot lose this one.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:19.148
Tom!

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:40.877
Tusk!

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:49.345
Tom!

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.093
Tom, the staff!

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:58.266
No!

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:11.116
Sadly, Gregory.

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:14.036
My orders are to
deliver you alive.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:50.698
Mam.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:54.994
Mam?

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.494
I don't understand.

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:01.083
How can you be here?

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:02.705
I'm not, Tom.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:07.582
I've passed on
from this world.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.715
I stood against
Mother Malkin.

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:14.888
And I failed.

01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:18.551
But you will not fail.

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:22.012
You are a seventh son, Tom.

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:25.103
But you are also
the son of a witch.

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:28.190
There has never
been anyone like you.

01:17:28.352 --> 01:17:31.606
Only you can wield
the Umbran stone

01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:35.410
and end her reign of
darkness before it begins.

01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:41.369
Empty your heart
of grief.

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:45.248
Fill it with courage.

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:49.874
You are ready now.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:52.797
Go.

01:17:54.879 --> 01:17:56.552
Find the stone.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:00.226
<i>Find it!</i>

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.793
You don't die easy, do you?

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:11.413
We have the master.
Where is the apprentice?

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:14.171
Dead.
Smashed on the rocks.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.251
What?

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:18.012
I told them
to follow you.

01:19:21.799 --> 01:19:22.925
You would never do that.

01:19:25.135 --> 01:19:27.012
I did it for you.

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:29.940
Look at your queen,
and find peace.

01:19:41.652 --> 01:19:42.949
Gregory!

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:45.201
Tonight.

01:19:45.906 --> 01:19:48.534
His reign of terror ends!

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:53.038
Join us.

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:56.710
You and I will
rule this world.

01:19:57.209 --> 01:20:00.383
United for eternity.

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:02.506
No.

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:06.261
Look at me.

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:11.439
Look at me!

01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:23.077
The darkness
is in you now.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.418
Join us.

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:36.832
For a worthy enemy

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:39.718
now honored

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:42.130
and welcome.

01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:45.758
The war is over.

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:48.515
Now we are together.

01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:01.322
Alice!

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:12.326
Traitor!

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:14.169
Don't kill her! Please!

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:20.088
Mother!

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:20.152
Where is my stone?

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:22.192
I lost it.

01:22:24.565 --> 01:22:26.283
I took it
to protect you.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:09.743
You fight me <i>as</i> a dragon,
not as a man!

01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:13.284
Have you no honor?

01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:01.291
You know nothing of dragons

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:07.960
nor of true honor.

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.668
Should have stayed
a dragon.

01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:07.792
My Queen.
What have you done?

01:26:08.372 --> 01:26:09.589
She's everything to me.

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:16.510
I thought betrayal was a sin
only committed by humans.

01:26:55.752 --> 01:26:58.756
Alone. I do this alone.

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:17.282
I was a fool.

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:23.281
You tricked me so you could
trap me in that hole.

01:27:24.948 --> 01:27:27.701
Made me believe
that you loved me.

01:27:28.785 --> 01:27:30.253
I did love you once.

01:27:33.623 --> 01:27:35.341
Then it is still there?

01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:37.127
Gone.

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:42.345
As my hatred is.

01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:21.259
I

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:26.553
will haunt you.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:43.716
In the old days

01:29:43.879 --> 01:29:47.304
there was a ceremony.
Flags.

01:29:47.382 --> 01:29:49.384
Magnificent horns.

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:52.183
Could be a bit silly
with just the two of us.

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:22.092
Did it hurt?

01:30:32.469 --> 01:30:33.470
No.

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:41.357
So you choose this life?

01:30:42.562 --> 01:30:44.564
It chose me.

01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:49.035
Then the blue spark,

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:53.490
it was just dust.

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:22.227
Do what you will.

01:31:23.103 --> 01:31:24.946
I know how you feel.

01:31:37.617 --> 01:31:39.119
<i>We will meet again.</i>

01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:02.942
The time has come,
Master Ward.

01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:07.814
Good-bye, Tusk.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:12.365
Forgive me.
Perhaps I was not clear.
'Tis I who ride.

01:32:13.069 --> 01:32:14.742
This is your home now.

01:32:16.406 --> 01:32:18.955
I trust you will
take care of it.

01:32:21.119 --> 01:32:23.622
And Tusk.
Mmm.

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:24.797
Yes, old friend.

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:30.512
Where will you go?

01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:32.222
Wrong question.

01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:36.301
Wrong questions
get wrong answers.
Tusk, give us a hand.

01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:41.519
Do you remember
all I taught you?

01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:44.226
Ignore it.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.863
The rules, Tom,

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.488
do not be bound by them.

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:55.286
Use them in your own way.
Live your own life.

01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:59.123
Your destiny.
