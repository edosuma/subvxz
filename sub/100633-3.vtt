WEBVTT

00:24.057 --> 00:27.327
Three, two, one...

00:27.393 --> 00:29.228
-[explosion]
-[King Shark] Yay!

00:29.295 --> 00:31.097
Ah, that was successful.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.801
Come on, We can't get
into Mr. Freeze's territory

00:33.868 --> 00:36.136
so why not we just
let him keep it, all right?

00:36.136 --> 00:39.206
Because he froze
my living body

00:39.206 --> 00:42.274
then put me on display
for my enemies to mock!

00:42.341 --> 00:44.109
[shivering] And now
you're freezing us!

00:44.109 --> 00:46.246
The cycle of violence is real.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.113
I will not rest
until we bury

00:48.113 --> 00:51.116
each and every one
of these Injustice League
motherfuckers

00:51.116 --> 00:52.284
who stole Gotham from me!

00:52.351 --> 00:54.454
So get meltin'.

00:54.521 --> 00:57.390
What? They're dumping
toxic waste into the harbor?

00:57.390 --> 00:59.100
I've gotta stop these assholes.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.694
-That happened like
two weeks ago.
-[Poison Ivy] It did?

01:00.761 --> 01:02.210
-Yeah.
-How did I miss that?

01:02.210 --> 01:05.465
Well, it certainly wasn't
because you were attending
my one man performance

01:05.465 --> 01:08.468
-of Joan Didion's
The Year of Magical Thinking.
-[King Shark] Ooh.

01:08.534 --> 01:10.870
I went!
He's no Vanessa Redgrave.

01:10.938 --> 01:13.640
-I had my own take!
-[Harley] Fire in the hole!

01:13.706 --> 01:15.341
-[explosion]
-[King Shark] Whoo!

01:15.409 --> 01:17.343
What the hell kinda
ice is this?

01:17.411 --> 01:19.445
[guard 1] The kind
you're never gonna see
the other side of!

01:19.513 --> 01:21.715
[guard 2] Yeah,
nothing burns hot enough...

01:21.781 --> 01:23.784
Oh, except Firefly's flame--

01:23.850 --> 01:25.686
-[guard 1] Fred!
-[guard 2] Oh.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.721
[guard 1] You almost told them
about Firefly's flamethrower!

01:27.721 --> 01:31.257
[Fred] Oh, well, great, Kevin,
now you did. You dummy.

01:31.323 --> 01:33.293
Sweet, I'll just
kick that guy's ass
and take his fire gun.

01:33.359 --> 01:34.795
[Kevin laughing]
Yeah. Cool idea.

01:34.861 --> 01:37.197
Did you get it from reading
Doctor Trap's diary?

01:37.197 --> 01:38.766
[Fred] Sorry, wait.
Who's Doctor Trap?

01:38.766 --> 01:40.578
[Kevin] Oh, my God! Dude!

01:40.578 --> 01:43.569
He's the guy that looted
all the villain's lairs
when the city fell.

01:43.569 --> 01:45.539
He's got a whole collection
of powerful crap

01:45.605 --> 01:47.441
at the Gotham Natural
History Museum

01:47.507 --> 01:49.777
including the aforementioned
fire gun.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.545
[Fred] Oh, right.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.813
-[Kevin] Shit!
-[Harley] Thanks
for all your help!

01:52.879 --> 01:55.180
Text us if you think
of anything else!

01:55.248 --> 01:59.185
[theme music playing]

01:59.185 --> 02:03.156
All right, listen. We get in,
grab this flamethrower,
and get out.

02:03.222 --> 02:05.591
Then there's this trash fire
barbecue place near here

02:05.659 --> 02:07.319
I've been dying to try out!

02:07.319 --> 02:08.996
-Sounds muy delish!
-[Poison Ivy chuckles]

02:08.996 --> 02:11.264
But we got a lot
of leftover chili
to get through.

02:11.264 --> 02:12.866
You guys are making
too much chili, okay?

02:12.866 --> 02:14.407
You never wanna
go out anymore!

02:14.407 --> 02:16.603
You know, we made
a pretty steep investment
in our slow cooker,

02:16.603 --> 02:18.572
so we just have to kinda
get our money's worth,
you know?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.407
Babe, you mention it's mild?

02:20.473 --> 02:22.308
I didn't sleep last night,
I was so amped.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.808
[Poison Ivy laughs] I know.
Me too, right?

02:25.344 --> 02:27.280
-Thanks for the ride, babe.
-Anytime, babe.

02:27.347 --> 02:29.282
Turns out in
a post-apocalyptic world,

02:29.282 --> 02:31.383
kites are pretty crucial.

02:31.450 --> 02:33.385
You know, you don't have
to say that every time
you drop us off, okay?

02:33.453 --> 02:36.657
I packed you
a high-protein snack
for a long lasting energy.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.525
For later. Wink.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.293
Did he just say "wink"?

02:40.360 --> 02:42.194
[chuckles] Yeah.
It's like an inside joke.
Whatever.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.396
Hey, so, I've been
meaning to talk to you
about something.

02:44.463 --> 02:46.265
And listen, don't take this
the wrong way,

02:46.332 --> 02:48.401
but as your BFF,
and only F,

02:48.401 --> 02:49.870
I think you can do better
than Kite Man.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.972
And what's the right way
to take that?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.674
[Harley] You know,
now that you're branching out

02:53.674 --> 02:56.000
from only caring about
things with branches,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.444
you gotta get out there,
just play the field!

02:58.444 --> 03:00.129
You're the new Poison Ivy!

03:00.129 --> 03:02.382
I mean, you don't have
to commit to the first guy
who's nice to you.

03:02.382 --> 03:04.717
Uh, your ex-boyfriend
tried to kill you
several times.

03:04.717 --> 03:06.199
It was an inside joke?

03:06.199 --> 03:07.753
Maybe you just don't know
what it's like to be

03:07.753 --> 03:09.522
treated well by someone
who truly loves you.

03:09.588 --> 03:11.491
[Harley grunts]

03:11.557 --> 03:14.461
Aw. Now I've got
smashin' blue-balls!

03:15.929 --> 03:17.396
[grunts]

03:17.463 --> 03:19.532
[sighs] Now I can
get on with my day.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.318
[gasps]

03:27.640 --> 03:32.378
Wow. This feels like
a lot of extra security
for free Museum Day.

03:32.445 --> 03:35.514
[Dr. Trap] Come, please,
enter the lair of Doctor Trap.

03:35.581 --> 03:36.883
I dare you!

03:36.950 --> 03:38.384
Ooh, I dare.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.287
Sorry. Are you Dr. Trap,

03:40.287 --> 03:41.587
or is that your boss?
Actually, it doesn't even matter.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.456
Just tell him that
we want no trouble,

03:43.456 --> 03:45.558
and we're just here
to grab Firefly's flamethrower,

03:45.558 --> 03:47.120
and then we're gonna be
on our way.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.563
[Dr. Trap] The treasure
is all yours if you can
best my traps.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.633
So, I beg you.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.568
Enter!

03:54.568 --> 03:56.382
Why are you
so obsessed with us?
Just give us the gun.

03:56.382 --> 03:58.639
Yeah, we actually
don't want to get into
a whole thing with you.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.272
Hey, is that
Penguin's umbrella?

04:00.340 --> 04:01.775
Ooh, I kinda want that.

04:01.842 --> 04:06.842
It's worth more now
that I killed him.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.718
Well, that seems like overkill.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.391
[Dr. Trap laughs maniacally]

04:18.458 --> 04:21.427
You know, I'd love to find
a way to do this without being
burned alive on a spike.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.430
Uh, yeah,
we're gonna have to like,
rethink this, Harls.

04:26.632 --> 04:28.468
Hey, Dr. Wheelbarrow,

04:28.535 --> 04:30.536
toss me one of them
fresh biscuits!

04:30.603 --> 04:32.439
I am trying to carbo-load here.

04:32.505 --> 04:34.841
-Don't hassle me!
They're for the hyenas!
-[hyenas laughing]

04:34.841 --> 04:36.641
Hey, buddy, buddy, bud,
open you mouth, Lou.

04:36.642 --> 04:39.012
Come on. One day
I'll return the favor.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.915
Really? If you wanted
to do an evil collab,

04:41.982 --> 04:44.851
you should've invited me
to join the Injustice League!

04:44.918 --> 04:47.586
And given me my
own damn slice of this city!

04:47.653 --> 04:51.391
[cackles] You and me
in the same board room?

04:51.391 --> 04:53.961
-No wonder those mangey curs
are laughing at you.
-[hyenas laughing]

04:54.028 --> 04:55.495
You listen to me, butt face!

04:55.562 --> 04:57.831
I was a huge supervillain

04:57.831 --> 05:01.802
before my reputation
was ruined over some
innocent locker room talk!

05:01.869 --> 05:04.071
And now, you're a babysitter.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.672
Are you in a club?

05:05.738 --> 05:08.541
Is there a classic series
of books about you?

05:08.608 --> 05:10.944
No! Because you
don't have friends

05:11.011 --> 05:12.913
and you don't go on heists!

05:12.980 --> 05:15.048
I love The Baby-Sitters Club.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.750
Claudia is my girl!

05:16.817 --> 05:18.418
I was more of
a Mallory fan myself.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.019
I, too, went through
an awkward period.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.355
That is it! [screaming]

05:22.422 --> 05:23.790
[laughing]

05:23.857 --> 05:25.524
[panting] Oh, no!

05:25.591 --> 05:27.427
My feeble mind. You...

05:27.494 --> 05:29.762
You've infiltrated it.

05:29.829 --> 05:30.963
Psych!

05:31.031 --> 05:33.000
You can't control my mind.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.069
I'm an A-lister.
I'm too smart.

05:35.134 --> 05:38.805
And you're just a weak
washed-up goon. [cackles]

05:38.872 --> 05:43.177
Oh, really? Can a goon give you
a makeover with his mind?

05:43.177 --> 05:45.778
How about something
to help with your oily skin?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.781
Maybe some little rouge?

05:47.848 --> 05:50.918
Not too much! I mean,
you're not an old
French whore, are you?

05:50.983 --> 05:54.521
Unless you are,
in which case,
here's some toilet water!

05:54.588 --> 05:55.822
[cackling] I love it.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.757
Do you have something
for thinning hair?

05:57.824 --> 05:59.559
[grunts in frustration]

05:59.625 --> 06:01.427
-[horns honking]
-[crash]

06:03.096 --> 06:04.899
[Poison Ivy] Ugh,
I hate this place.

06:04.899 --> 06:06.565
When I go to lunch,
I want a meal
not a grouping of sides.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.067
And I want that flamethrower,

06:08.134 --> 06:10.569
not a spike through my head
from Dr. Get A Life.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.173
So I called the best burglar
in all of Gotham

06:13.240 --> 06:14.774
and this is where
they wanted to meet.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.442
Wait. Why'd you say "they?"

06:16.442 --> 06:18.444
-It's Catwoman, isn't it?
-Aren't you excited? Ah!

06:18.511 --> 06:21.413
You're good friends!
Reunited! For a heist!

06:21.480 --> 06:23.483
[grunts] I mean,
three badass ladies

06:23.483 --> 06:26.519
takin' down that sackless
dweeb Dr. Trap,

06:26.586 --> 06:28.521
then stealin'
his priceless artifacts.

06:28.588 --> 06:31.057
Oh, this is gonna be
so crazy, sexy, cool!

06:31.125 --> 06:33.994
Just like when you two
teamed up for that
fun Amazon thingie.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.661
[sighs] Fun amazon thingie?

06:35.728 --> 06:37.463
You know she screwed me
over on that.

06:37.529 --> 06:39.665
That was years ago.
People change.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.168
Who even remembers
what happened?

06:41.235 --> 06:43.137
Um, she didn't help me
take down those loggers,

06:43.137 --> 06:44.704
she ditched me
for a blood diamond

06:44.704 --> 06:46.572
leaving me to pay
for the entire hotel bill.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.608
And she got a ton
of spa treatments.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.810
There was like all kinds
of scrubs that
I've never even heard of!

06:50.810 --> 06:54.447
Okay, then maybe
this'll be like
a much needed exercise

06:54.514 --> 06:56.949
in emotional boundaries
for ya? Huh?

06:57.016 --> 06:58.552
No, no see, you don't get it.

06:58.617 --> 07:00.987
Selina's like,
she's so confident and cool.

07:01.055 --> 07:03.523
And somehow, she just like,
draws you in by being aloof.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.692
You know, you just see her,
and you're like,
"Ah, I want to be like that."

07:05.759 --> 07:07.627
And then, you see her
wearing overalls,
and you're like,

07:07.694 --> 07:08.987
"Oh, maybe I want overalls."

07:08.987 --> 07:11.463
And then suddenly, you have
a closet full of overalls
that don't look good on you.

07:11.463 --> 07:12.833
What the fuck
are you talking about?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.516
Can we just leave
before she gets here?

07:23.911 --> 07:25.978
Oh, hi, hi. [kisses] Yes.

07:26.045 --> 07:28.081
-Nice jacket.
-What this?

07:28.148 --> 07:31.117
Oh, yeah... [sputters]
I was thinking about
donating it actually.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.187
It's just like this style's
gotten so trendy, you know?

07:33.187 --> 07:34.987
Cobb salads, all around.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.557
[groans]
See, she always does this,
she orders for everyone.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.925
So controlling.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.889
I got your message about
the museum, Harley.

07:40.889 --> 07:44.264
Oh. Uh, yeah, you know,
in light of some recent
retellings of old stories

07:44.264 --> 07:46.064
I should've paid more
attention to, maybe we--

07:46.065 --> 07:47.233
They have an Egyptian ruby

07:47.300 --> 07:48.869
I've been thinking
about wanting.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.538
Ah, rubies,
that's so classy. Yes.

07:51.538 --> 07:52.939
They're like fun
and timeless,

07:52.939 --> 07:54.673
but like way less obvious
than a diamond.

07:54.673 --> 07:55.709
So, I'm in.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.744
Wow! Just like that?

07:57.744 --> 07:59.879
Do you really like
this jacket or were you
just saying that you did?

07:59.947 --> 08:01.148
What do you think?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.648
-What do you think?
-What's happening?

08:03.850 --> 08:05.517
Actually, the truth is

08:05.517 --> 08:07.019
we're just not comfortable
working tog--

08:07.019 --> 08:08.956
Ah, this is so awesome!
[chuckles]

08:08.956 --> 08:10.757
I mean, I just can't wait
to get started.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.625
I mean, you were so right
about these Cobb salads,

08:12.625 --> 08:14.228
it's amazing. I mean,
I don't eat meat or whatever,

08:14.228 --> 08:15.762
but I can just push them away.
And I mean, look at us,

08:15.762 --> 08:17.697
we're like the Cobb squad!
You know?

08:17.764 --> 08:19.833
Should we all get
matching tattoos?
I mean, I'm kidding. Or am I?

08:19.834 --> 08:21.302
I mean, we could do it, right?
I know a guy.

08:21.302 --> 08:22.901
Ive, she just stole
your favorite jacket.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.704
I know, but it looks
so much better on her.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.908
[Harley sighs]
Is she always late?

08:28.975 --> 08:30.310
Yes. It is a power move.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.078
Well, it's not even original.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.879
I've been stood up
by badder-asses.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.081
Here, kitty, kitty!

08:35.149 --> 08:36.783
Are you always this impetuous?

08:36.783 --> 08:38.152
Give me a dictionary,
and I'll tell ya.

08:38.152 --> 08:40.254
A chauffeur?
You must be doing well.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.587
He's my boyfriend.

08:41.654 --> 08:43.056
And she's my girlfriend.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.225
-Cute.
-So, what's the plan?

08:45.225 --> 08:47.995
I was thinking,
first, we smash through
the skylight, then--

08:47.995 --> 08:50.663
Don't catsplain breaking
and entering to me.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.899
The plan is,
I handle the traps,

08:52.899 --> 08:54.650
you follow me.

08:54.650 --> 08:56.802
I'm not used
to working in a team,
so keep your distance.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.639
All right, ladies,
have fun taking down
that beta cuck.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.107
-Babe, are you not coming?
-Oh, no.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.943
My biggest fear is traps.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.077
And space.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.980
No kites in space there, so...

09:07.047 --> 09:09.115
I'm gonna hang back,
keep watch.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.684
Maybe pick up some
iced coffees for you strong,
female anti-heroes.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.620
Ugh, it's her signature move!

09:16.123 --> 09:18.057
[glass shatters]

09:18.125 --> 09:19.793
Psst, Harley.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.259
What are we at a play?
What do you want?

09:21.260 --> 09:22.828
So, uh, earlier...

09:22.828 --> 09:24.155
[whispers] I was lying.

09:24.155 --> 09:25.999
Yeah, I thought it was
too loser-y to be
afraid of traps.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.869
No, I am very afraid,
but I'm going in anyway.

09:28.934 --> 09:30.769
There's a diamond shaped
like a leaf in there

09:30.836 --> 09:33.605
that'll make the perfect
engagement ring for Ivy.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.142
She loves stuff with leaves!

09:35.142 --> 09:37.344
Are you sure Ivy wants to take
this next step with you?

09:37.344 --> 09:39.011
Maybe take a lesson
from the slow cooker

09:39.011 --> 09:40.313
and let that shit simmer, huh?

09:40.313 --> 09:43.317
No way! Our love is cooked
to perfection.

09:43.384 --> 09:46.720
So, traps be damned!
I'm getting the diamond.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.222
There is no trap in the world
that could stop me!

09:49.222 --> 09:50.623
But if one does,

09:50.690 --> 09:51.991
tell Ivy it's okay
to love again

09:52.000 --> 09:53.692
after an appropriate
mourning period, mmmkay?

09:53.692 --> 09:54.693
Ugh!

09:56.296 --> 09:57.778
Shit! They're gone.

09:57.778 --> 09:59.932
Thanks, dude. Now I have
no idea how to get
the flamethrower.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.768
It's probs
in the armory exhibit.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.304
Ooh, I bet they have
some sick arrowheads.

10:04.370 --> 10:07.673
Love to peep those babies
if we have time. Follow me.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.976
You're willing to go first
into this death trap?

10:10.043 --> 10:12.778
If herein lies
my lady's diamond,
then totes.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.347
-Works for me.
-[grunting]

10:14.414 --> 10:16.048
Survived my first trap.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.918
That wasn't a trap,
that was a pencil.

10:20.687 --> 10:21.721
[grunts]

10:21.788 --> 10:23.789
So, you have a boyfriend, huh?

10:23.789 --> 10:25.826
Rolling him like
we did those loggers?

10:25.892 --> 10:27.693
-Oh, no. We're dating.
-Dating?

10:27.760 --> 10:30.129
Yeah, you know,
we like eat dinner,
we have sex,

10:30.197 --> 10:31.932
complain about the crew.
You know?

10:31.999 --> 10:34.100
-[Dr. Trap] Heads up! [laughs]
-[thuds]

10:34.168 --> 10:35.836
Hmm. You hate people.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.770
Yeah. I mean,
now I hate most people.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.006
I guess a lot has changed
since the last time
we hung out.

10:40.072 --> 10:43.277
I guess, you know, I have
more than just my journal
to confide in, you know?

10:44.711 --> 10:46.947
[Dr. Trap] Oh, no!

10:47.014 --> 10:48.682
[Poison Ivy] My question is
where did he find
the contractors to do all this?

10:48.748 --> 10:50.792
-You know what I'm saying?
-[Dr. Trap] Please.

10:50.792 --> 10:54.721
Evil construction's
a booming business
in new New Gotham.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.024
Selina!

10:58.091 --> 10:59.426
[Catwoman]
Don't stress me out.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.429
So, what are you gonna
do with this flamethrower?

11:03.496 --> 11:06.700
Melt a climate change
denier's summer home?
[laughs]

11:06.765 --> 11:09.903
[sputters]
I'm helping Harley

11:09.970 --> 11:12.038
get revenge
on Mr. Freeze, so...

11:12.105 --> 11:14.375
-You mean, you're retired?
-What? No!

11:14.441 --> 11:18.044
I've just been busy,
you know, with life,
and, and, and...

11:18.044 --> 11:19.913
[sputters]
So what do you care?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.815
[Catwoman]
I'm just trying to understand.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.315
You used to have
such a clear brand.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.988
What's the last thing
you did for the environment?

11:28.054 --> 11:29.889
Well, when's the last time
you stole a jewel?

11:29.956 --> 11:31.124
Girl, please.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.059
I'm never not
stealing jewels.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.897
[grunting]

11:37.297 --> 11:38.465
Nets!

11:38.532 --> 11:40.100
The sworn enemy
of the kite!

11:40.167 --> 11:41.467
Along with a mild summer.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.102
[Dr. Trap] Watch your fingers.

11:43.102 --> 11:44.602
-[Harley grunting]
-[Dr. Trap laughs]

11:45.538 --> 11:47.073
[Kite Man grunts]

11:47.139 --> 11:49.176
[Kite Man] Whoa,
is that Deathstroke's sword?

11:49.176 --> 11:51.010
Let's just go back!
I bet they have
the flamethrower

11:51.010 --> 11:52.446
and they're waiting
for us outside.

11:52.513 --> 11:54.514
No! This may come
as a shock,

11:54.581 --> 11:56.316
but I could never
do better than Ivy.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.851
-I know.
-You know, she pretends
to hate everyone,

11:58.918 --> 12:00.254
but under that,

12:00.254 --> 12:02.822
I've never known
a more supportive,

12:02.889 --> 12:04.490
understanding, caring,

12:04.557 --> 12:06.993
and funny woman
who can control plants.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.361
She deserves the world!

12:08.428 --> 12:09.828
So, the least I can do

12:09.828 --> 12:11.097
is give her the most
beautiful ring

12:11.097 --> 12:13.366
medieval Europe has to offer!

12:13.433 --> 12:14.833
[sighs]

12:14.833 --> 12:16.736
All right, let's get you
that ring, sport.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.211
[Kite Man screams]

12:24.278 --> 12:26.480
Another net!
No, no, no, no! It's worse.

12:26.547 --> 12:30.082
It's a spider web!
It's nature's net! [whimpers]

12:30.149 --> 12:32.385
-[Dr. Trap laughing]
-[growls]

12:32.452 --> 12:33.852
[Dr. Psycho] Come on.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.889
Of course I could run a crew.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.158
You've seen what
my brain is capable of.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.059
[softly] They don't get me.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.495
What I don't get is
why you need
validation from me!

12:41.562 --> 12:43.129
That suggests a weak mind!

12:43.196 --> 12:45.932
You're just a crazy hair,
weak-minded motherfu--

12:45.999 --> 12:47.134
[screams]

12:47.200 --> 12:49.068
The Riddler is missing!

12:49.135 --> 12:51.004
What do you mean,
"The Riddler is missing?"

12:51.071 --> 12:55.075
[laughing] That's the shit
I'm talking about!

12:55.142 --> 12:58.479
I mean, missing, like,
he's not where he's
supposed to be!

12:58.479 --> 12:59.988
-[Dr. Psycho] Shit!
-[King Shark] I'm so worried.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.582
[Dr. Psycho]
But I'm the only one
with the keys!

13:02.649 --> 13:04.418
[sniffs] Lavender sage.

13:04.485 --> 13:06.285
He must've used
all the body butter

13:06.352 --> 13:07.921
you threw at him to slip out.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.556
Oh, how the Riddler
hath played you.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.392
Harley will be most displeased.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.893
Displeased?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.596
She's gonna fuckin' kill me!

13:15.596 --> 13:18.365
This was the one thing
she told me to do!

13:18.432 --> 13:21.168
That of course, and feed
the koi in the fountain,

13:21.235 --> 13:23.169
but I breaded
and fried those fuckers!

13:23.236 --> 13:26.072
It's amazing
how good you are
at running a crew!

13:26.139 --> 13:27.908
-[laughs]
-Oh, fuck!

13:27.908 --> 13:30.043
There's no reason
to freak out
over a lost prisoner.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.424
Unless...

13:31.424 --> 13:34.414
you've built a rapport in order
to gain their trust to break them,

13:34.480 --> 13:37.216
but in the process
they've broken you.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.552
I guess what I'm sayin' is,

13:38.552 --> 13:40.086
did anyone fall in love
with the Riddler?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.355
Come on. Show of hands.

13:41.355 --> 13:43.056
Is that a hand I see
in the back there?

13:43.056 --> 13:44.258
Oh, no,
that's a massage chair.

13:44.258 --> 13:45.991
Oh, look! He left a riddle.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.528
"Who's running loose
in the mall

13:47.595 --> 13:49.062
but not one of y'all?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.864
And who will never run a crew

13:50.931 --> 13:52.466
'cause this prisoner
slipped through?

13:52.533 --> 13:54.234
Now, let the chase ensue.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.037
If you ever find this note,
you dumb..."

13:57.104 --> 13:59.004
Oh, it just gets
dirty from there.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.474
Oh, he's pay for this!

14:00.541 --> 14:02.442
All right, Sy,
you take the mezzanine,

14:02.509 --> 14:04.611
King Shark, you take
the fountains and bathrooms,

14:04.677 --> 14:06.480
Clayface, take
the ground floor!

14:06.480 --> 14:08.548
I'm gonna supervise
over walkie-talkies,

14:08.548 --> 14:10.618
which is the hardest
and most leadership-heavy
part of a split up.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.374
Now split!

14:13.320 --> 14:15.389
[Catwoman]
This teamwork is suffocating.

14:15.456 --> 14:17.890
-I don't know how
you live this way.
-[trap floor clicks]

14:17.957 --> 14:20.059
Yeah, I mean, I guess
it just sorta happened,

14:20.059 --> 14:21.961
-but you know,
I mean, I like it.
-[device whirs]

14:22.028 --> 14:23.630
I mean, you could
try it sometime.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.966
[Dr. Trap] Oh, a deadly game
of Hopscotch. [laughs]

14:27.600 --> 14:29.201
Step where I step.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.605
[Dr. Trap] Hoppity, hoppity.
[laughs]

14:32.673 --> 14:34.541
Oh, it's like
she's dancing on air.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.311
Whoa, those are
sick arrowheads. [grunts]

14:37.376 --> 14:41.981
[Dr. Trap] Oh, careful now.

14:42.048 --> 14:46.019
-[gasps]
-Oh, no. Someone had
an extra helping of salad.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.488
[Dr. Trap laughing]

14:47.553 --> 14:49.054
[panting]

14:49.054 --> 14:50.056
[screams]

14:50.056 --> 14:52.605
[sighs in relief]

14:55.361 --> 14:59.466
[Catwoman] This whole museum
field trip doesn't feel
like your scene.

14:59.533 --> 15:01.033
Maybe you need to reevaluate.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.035
Oh, I don't think so.
Do you think so?

15:03.035 --> 15:04.571
I mean, how strongly
do you think so?

15:04.571 --> 15:06.173
You know what, never mind.
I'm good with it.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.740
I am. I'm happy about
my decision. Right?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.176
Oh, goodie!

15:09.176 --> 15:10.744
I didn't miss stealing
the flamethrower.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.513
Wait, how did you get
past the traps?

15:12.578 --> 15:15.282
-[bees buzzing]
-[screaming]
Get them off of me!

15:15.349 --> 15:17.484
Get them off of me!
[inhales sharply]

15:17.551 --> 15:18.798
Oh, no, I'm good.

15:18.798 --> 15:20.687
Oh, my God!
What's wrong with your face?

15:20.754 --> 15:23.322
Oh, bad reaction to
my new deodorant, babe.

15:23.389 --> 15:24.591
Back to the
chemical stuff.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.427
Here's your super soaker.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.261
Pleasure doing
business with you.
Now let's get outta here.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.530
Wait, babe,
what are you doing here?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.399
I had to get
something for you.

15:32.466 --> 15:35.668
There's a special question
that I have been waiting
to repop.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.138
Oh. Um...

15:38.205 --> 15:39.673
[whispers]
Can we do this later?

15:39.740 --> 15:41.106
Last time I tried,

15:41.173 --> 15:42.475
I didn't have a ring.

15:42.543 --> 15:45.645
But now,
nothing can go wrong.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.149
[exhales] Uh, Poison,

15:49.216 --> 15:51.116
Gertrude Ivy, my love,

15:51.751 --> 15:54.019
my life, uh...

15:54.086 --> 15:56.990
will you do me
the honor of...

15:57.057 --> 15:58.291
Where's my ring?

15:58.357 --> 16:00.494
Gotta go. Girl power.
And all that.

16:00.561 --> 16:03.410
Wow, what a cold B.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.403
[Dr. Trap] Well, thank you.
Exit through the gift shop.
Not!

16:10.470 --> 16:12.239
Wait, that's your real voice?

16:12.304 --> 16:14.541
[Dr. Trap] Yes. We'll see
what your voice sounds like

16:14.607 --> 16:19.346
when you've survived
several trap-related mishaps.
[laughs]

16:19.413 --> 16:22.182
You're all going
to die in my trap!

16:22.249 --> 16:24.183
[laughs maniacally]

16:25.818 --> 16:27.187
Come on, come on, come on!

16:27.254 --> 16:28.654
Somebody give me
a goddamn update!

16:28.721 --> 16:31.291
I'm having quite
an emotional experience here.

16:31.357 --> 16:34.094
You ever vibrate
at just the right setting

16:34.159 --> 16:37.764
to really connect to a
Baby-Sitters Club audiobook?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.198
Anybody?

16:39.265 --> 16:40.567
[sniffing]

16:41.400 --> 16:42.669
He's on foot.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.500
Calm down, he can't
have gotten far.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.506
-[Riddler on walkie-talkie]
And he's got a walkie-talkie!
-[groaning]

16:46.572 --> 16:48.741
Over! Ten four! Copy that!
[laughing]

16:48.808 --> 16:50.210
Did you copy that, Psycho?

16:50.277 --> 16:52.546
[laughs]

16:52.613 --> 16:54.380
Find him, you morons!

16:54.447 --> 16:57.149
Ah-ha! I've got the target
in my sights.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.352
[Dr. Psycho on walkie-talkie]
You sure?

16:58.352 --> 16:59.352
Uh, it could be
a massage chair.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.580
It's not.

17:00.580 --> 17:01.788
[Riddler on walkie-talkie]
Or it could be me.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.500
Just take the shot!

17:03.500 --> 17:05.625
[Riddler on walkie-talkie]
Oh, yeah, shoot me. Shoot me.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.428
[Dr. Psycho] If I go down
for this, I'm taking
all of you with me!

17:08.494 --> 17:11.198
[Sy] There you are,
you little rat bastard.

17:11.699 --> 17:13.567
Ah! [groans]

17:13.634 --> 17:16.403
[Dr. Trap laughing]

17:16.470 --> 17:18.806
I'll get the ring
back from her,
it's no biggie. [chuckles]

17:18.873 --> 17:22.174
The important thing is
that, um... [clears throat]

17:22.174 --> 17:23.609
-From the day I met you--
-[banging]

17:23.609 --> 17:25.546
I knew...

17:25.612 --> 17:29.082
[Dr. Trap] Smash away,
smashy pants! [laughs]

17:29.148 --> 17:31.751
You know, this is
one of my fave five traps,

17:31.818 --> 17:34.221
made out of the same stuff
as airplane windows.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.690
Listen, Ivy, before we get
smushed to death,

17:36.757 --> 17:38.200
-will you--
-Ugh!

17:38.200 --> 17:40.160
Catwoman could've easily
gotten us out of this.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.862
She got herself out
and that's all
she cares about.

17:41.929 --> 17:43.500
Fuck her! She sucks!

17:43.500 --> 17:45.665
I just want you to know
that every part of me--

17:45.732 --> 17:47.800
Yeah, I just honestly
don't think it's such
a bad way to be,

17:47.800 --> 17:49.461
only worrying about yourself.

17:49.461 --> 17:51.733
I mean, there's something
to be said for not getting
smushed to death.

17:51.733 --> 17:53.874
-[sighs] I'm messing this up.
-We're only here
because of her!

17:53.941 --> 17:56.308
No, no, no, we're here
because of your
stupid fire gun

17:56.375 --> 17:57.577
that probably
won't even work.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.378
It's a plasma flamethrower,

17:59.445 --> 18:01.146
and it can melt any...
Oh, duh!

18:01.213 --> 18:03.215
I love the shape of your
sharp elbows, and, uh--

18:03.282 --> 18:05.285
And because I don't
even know what's
important to me anymore.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.287
I mean, Catwoman has
it all figured out.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.122
She knows what she wants
and she gets it.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.557
She has 19 cats.

18:10.624 --> 18:12.192
She can never go on vacation.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.528
I mean, imagine,
finding someone to watch them.

18:14.595 --> 18:15.695
Fire in the hole!

18:15.762 --> 18:17.530
[shouting]
Ivy, will you marry--

18:17.530 --> 18:18.832
-[Poison Ivy] Stop!
-Not the right time?

18:18.832 --> 18:20.400
No, it's not
the right time.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.935
I don't know if it'll ever
be the right time.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.338
And I don't know if I ever
wanna get married, okay?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.844
Damn it, that would've been
great for a trap.

18:30.911 --> 18:33.512
No, no, no, there's no need
to keep interacting.

18:33.579 --> 18:34.882
You beat my traps.

18:34.949 --> 18:36.148
You're free to go!

18:36.215 --> 18:39.619
And you're free to... Um...

18:39.685 --> 18:41.688
Shut your trap, Trap!
[grunts]

18:42.556 --> 18:43.790
[grunts]

18:43.856 --> 18:47.359
-[speaking incoherently]
-[metal clicking]

18:47.426 --> 18:51.530
Well, you've returned
without the customary
"heading back" text. Rude.

18:51.597 --> 18:52.932
Did you get the gun?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.201
Yup. This'll burn down
Freeze's wall and...

18:55.268 --> 18:56.936
Why does it look like
you guys had
a harder night than me?

18:56.936 --> 18:57.971
'Cause we did!

18:57.971 --> 18:59.772
Oh, fine, you broke me!

18:59.839 --> 19:01.207
Riddler's on the loose.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.375
We can't find him.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.810
We think he ate Psycho.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.511
What? Psycho lost Riddler?

19:05.578 --> 19:07.247
He's a shmuck, I told him.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.884
I don't know why
he's on the crew.

19:08.884 --> 19:10.651
Okay. Let's fan out,
check the cupboards
and cubbies,

19:10.717 --> 19:11.919
keep your eyes low,

19:11.919 --> 19:13.487
we'll find him
before Riddler eats him,

19:13.487 --> 19:15.454
and someone order
a damn pizza!

19:15.521 --> 19:17.301
One pizza comin' up.

19:17.301 --> 19:19.726
[Riddler] Yoo-hoo!
What's round
and moving much slower

19:19.792 --> 19:21.961
than when I was inside of it?
[chuckles]

19:22.028 --> 19:25.632
Why's he gotta be
so cute about everythin'?
It's so ew.

19:25.699 --> 19:27.534
[screams] Let me out!

19:27.601 --> 19:29.869
Psycho, your job was
to guard someone
who was chained up.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.872
You could've just read a book
and this wouldn't
have happened!

19:31.939 --> 19:33.640
May I recommend
The Baby-Sitters Club?

19:33.707 --> 19:36.777
The series that focused
on Stacey's diabetes

19:36.844 --> 19:38.478
was so moving.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.746
Oh, bullshit!

19:39.813 --> 19:41.949
You made me
a glorified mall cop!

19:42.000 --> 19:45.218
I am trying to take down
the Injustice League here!

19:45.285 --> 19:47.554
I don't have time
to recapture my prisoners!

19:47.621 --> 19:49.923
Your boy's an idiot.

19:49.990 --> 19:52.459
-Agreed.
-Oh, if you're
so smart, Einstein,

19:52.526 --> 19:53.660
why didn't you just leave?

19:53.727 --> 19:54.760
I'm gonna tell you why.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.797
'Cause you fear my wrath.

19:56.864 --> 19:58.865
Yeah. [scoffs] Right.
[chuckles]

19:58.932 --> 20:00.768
It's a waste land out there.

20:00.834 --> 20:03.569
In here, I get three squares,
plenty of cardio.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.873
I'm in the best shape
of my life,

20:05.940 --> 20:07.942
plus there's
free entertainment

20:08.008 --> 20:09.542
watching you idiots

20:09.609 --> 20:12.244
fail to accomplish
even the simplest of tasks.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.480
I'll escape when
I'm good and ready.

20:14.548 --> 20:16.616
-[Dr. Psycho] God, what
is this, fucking Candyland?
-[hyenas laughing]

20:17.884 --> 20:19.619
Hey! What are you up to?

20:19.685 --> 20:22.422
You know, just getting back
in touch with my roots.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.690
[man screaming]

20:24.758 --> 20:26.559
Very cool. Very cool.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.327
I mean, how am I
gonna have time
to focus on my goals

20:28.394 --> 20:30.497
when I'm responsible
to so many people now?

20:30.564 --> 20:32.967
You know? It's like,
this is just not where I saw
my life going.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.935
[Harley] Hmm, I hear ya.
I mean, I thought I'd be
married to Joker by now.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.371
But do you really think
your life was better
before all this,

20:38.371 --> 20:40.440
when you were
more like Catwoman?

20:40.507 --> 20:42.509
Yeah, 'cause no one's
stopping her from doing
what she wants.

20:42.576 --> 20:45.511
Like punishing Ace Chemical's
board of directors

20:45.578 --> 20:47.647
for illegal dumping
of toxic waste!

20:47.713 --> 20:50.584
[sighs] You know,
when I met Kite Man,
I thought he was a total dweeb

20:50.651 --> 20:52.853
who didn't even deserve
to breathe the same air as you.

20:52.853 --> 20:55.387
-Yeah, me, too.
-Then he started
hanging around more

20:55.454 --> 20:56.900
and I still
didn't really like him.

20:56.900 --> 20:59.826
But today, he risked his life
to get you that diamond
you wanted.

20:59.893 --> 21:02.695
-I didn't want that diamond.
-Yeah, I know.
It's totally not your taste.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.631
-It's too whimsical.
-Far too whimsical.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.700
But I saw a less lame
side of him

21:06.700 --> 21:08.067
and I'm starting to get it.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.836
-He grows on you, right?
-Yeah.

21:09.903 --> 21:11.570
Ive, you're never
gonna be Catwoman

21:11.570 --> 21:13.573
because you have people
that love you.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.407
People who want
the best for you.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.477
People who will help you
with your goals if you let 'em.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.511
[man screaming]

21:18.577 --> 21:19.645
-Can I do one?
-Sure.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.949
[Harley squeals]

21:22.000 --> 21:23.400
-[man] No, please!
-[Harley laughs]

21:24.584 --> 21:26.019
[Poison Ivy]
I know I'm happier now.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.021
-And cooler.
-Hmm, not cooler,

21:28.021 --> 21:30.857
but I guess
it's hard to let go
of your past self, huh?

21:30.857 --> 21:31.857
You don't have to.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.494
[man gurgling]

21:43.069 --> 21:44.872
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:44.938 --> 21:47.641
Uh, full disclosure,
I'm a little bit wasted.

21:47.708 --> 21:51.758
Fair enough.
Can I come in?

21:54.381 --> 21:55.949
Come on. [grunting]

21:56.016 --> 21:58.018
Look, I... I know
it's not your fault

21:58.085 --> 22:00.554
that I don't have the life
that I thought I would.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.855
And I took my frustrations
with myself out on you.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.023
And I'm sorry.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.576
I want what you want, babe.

22:05.576 --> 22:07.060
And if you need more time,
that's good with me.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.662
-No presh.
-But... [sighs]

22:08.729 --> 22:11.065
If you wanted
to ask me again...

22:11.065 --> 22:13.067
Oh, I get it.
You're not ready.

22:13.133 --> 22:14.701
And you know what?
Maybe I'm not ready.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.936
-Now's good.
-You sure?

22:17.003 --> 22:18.571
'Cause I can't do this
a fourth time.

22:18.637 --> 22:19.740
I'm ready.

22:19.806 --> 22:20.973
Ask me.

22:24.178 --> 22:26.413
[theme music playing]
