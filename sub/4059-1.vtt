00:32.323 --> 00:35.919
Hey, Joe, drag your foot, boy.
Look what we got here.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.688
Hey, you wanna drag, huh?

00:37.788 --> 00:39.565
Sure.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.194
Come on, man. Get ready.

01:00.477 --> 01:03.250
I'll show 'em how to drive. Just watch me.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.663
Sir, as high as this river is right now,

03:41.763 --> 03:44.041
and with all the mud and sand
it's carryin',

03:44.141 --> 03:46.576
they may never find that car.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.821
Uh-uh.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.387
Right there.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.890
All right, let's hear your story
about how it happened.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.143
- It wasn't our fault, sir.
- Yeah?

04:03.243 --> 04:07.939
We were the first ones on the bridge,
and coming a-along following the tracks,

04:08.039 --> 04:11.902
and they wanted to get around us,
I guess, and they lost control...

04:12.002 --> 04:14.130
You sure you didn't crowd 'em off?

04:25.474 --> 04:26.942
Three hours.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.587
Yeah? Not sure I wanna find that car now.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.757
With this sand and with that current,
we may never find 'em.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.781
About all I guess
we can do is keep tryin'.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.501
Look.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.855
Come on. Let's get down there.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.120
Why, it's Mary Henry.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.272
Are you all right?

05:30.372 --> 05:31.715
How'd you get out?

05:32.707 --> 05:35.426
Here, put this on.
We'd better get you back to town.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.391
What about the other girls?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.518
I don't remember.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.987
Is this like the one
I'll be playing in Utah?

08:24.087 --> 08:25.697
It's quite similar.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.700
I supervised the installation myself.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.077
The accident won't delay
your going, will it?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.830
No. I'm leaving this morning.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.524
- There's nothing I can do here.
- That's right.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.128
Well, Mary, you'll make
a fine organist for that church.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.172
Be very satisfying to you, I think.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.090
It's just a job to me.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.802
Well, that's not quite the attitude
for going into church work.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.764
I'm not taking the vows.
I'm only going to play the organ.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.141
Oh, you want more than that.

08:53.241 --> 08:57.587
Of course it doesn't pay much,
but, well, at least it's a start.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.757
Are you driving by Benton
to see your folks?

09:01.499 --> 09:04.235
No, I can't. I... I must hurry.

09:04.335 --> 09:07.464
I... I've got to leave.
I'm going to drive straight through.

09:07.881 --> 09:12.786
Mary, it takes more than intellect
to be a musician.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.265
Put your soul into it a little, okay?

09:22.979 --> 09:24.481
Good luck, Mary.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.717
Stop by and see us
the next time you're in.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.661
Thank you, but I'm never coming back.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.295
Can I help you?

13:32.395 --> 13:34.648
- Fill it up.
- All right.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.267
Be anything else, lady?

14:02.925 --> 14:07.497
Could you tell me what that big structure
is back a few miles by the lake?

14:07.597 --> 14:10.115
Oh, you mean the old bathhouse.

14:10.215 --> 14:13.211
Yeah, that used to be
a pretty ritzy place in the old days.

14:13.311 --> 14:16.673
Then the lake went down
and they made a dance hall out of it.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.841
Then they put those buildings up out there

14:18.941 --> 14:21.844
and made some sort of
a carnival there for a while.

14:21.944 --> 14:25.807
Ah, that's years ago though.
Just stands out there now.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.284
I see.

14:30.328 --> 14:34.208
Uh, I have an address here of
a rooming house. Could you direct me?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.803
Oh, sure. Why, that's just
right over here a little way.

14:47.178 --> 14:50.227
Been savin' it for you
since I got your letter.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.461
Could've rented it yesterday
if I'd wanted.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.590
Oh, it... it's fine.
I-It's just about what I expected.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.488
I knew you'd like it.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.138
This ain't no regular
roomin' house, you know.

15:05.238 --> 15:09.414
I only got you
and Mr. Linden across the hall.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.255
Each room's got its own
private bathroom too.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.740
You can take all the baths you want.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.576
I'm not one to fuss
about things like that.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.895
Thank you.
I think I'll be quite comfortable.

15:29.387 --> 15:32.081
Well, hope you'll stay a while.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.001
I'm downstairs
in the back part of the house,

15:35.101 --> 15:40.232
so if there's anything else you need,
guess it'll have to wait till morning.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.720
Night.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.663
Good night, Mrs. Thomas.

16:44.587 --> 16:48.433
And this, Miss Henry,
is our pride and joy.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.661
This was made in the same town
where I've been studying.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.997
Of course.
That's where we heard about you.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.333
You have found a place to stay?

16:57.433 --> 16:59.836
- Yes, I have a room.
- Good.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.672
Well, we hope
you're going to like it here.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.258
We're not the largest church
in this area, of course,

17:05.358 --> 17:09.220
but we have a nice congregation.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.765
We'll have to have some sort of reception.
They'll want to meet you.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.352
- Couldn't we just skip that?
- Skip that?

17:16.452 --> 17:19.480
I don't suppose
it's an absolute necessity.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.608
I don't know what
some of the ladies will say.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.903
If they say I'm a fine organist,
that should be enough, shouldn't it?

17:26.002 --> 17:28.698
Well, yes, of course.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.993
We'll let it go at that
for the time being.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.704
But, my dear,

17:34.804 --> 17:39.184
you cannot live in isolation
from the human race, you know.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.021
- Mind if I try this now?
- I want you to.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.068
You go right ahead.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.547
I'll be next door at the manse,
if you need me.

18:24.645 --> 18:28.821
We have an organist
capable of stirring the soul.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.628
What do you see?

19:26.957 --> 19:29.902
Oh. Nothing. Nothing at all.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.655
I've practiced all afternoon
and it's gotten me in a mood.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.240
You need some fresh air.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.076
I've got to make a call out past the lake.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.620
Would you like to come along for the ride?

19:39.720 --> 19:42.623
- You know that old pavilion out there?
- Mm-hmm.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.750
- Will we pass it?
- Go right by it.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.962
- Stop and look at it if you like.
- I would, with you along.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.234
Good.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.543
This used to be quite a place.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.088
- It's been deserted for a long time now.
- Will you take me in?

20:31.188 --> 20:35.134
Goodness no.
It isn't safe out there anymore.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.261
That's why they put up this barrier.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.409
Be very easy to step around it.

20:40.698 --> 20:44.310
What attraction could
there be for you out there?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.645
I'm not sure.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.544
I'm a reasonable person. I don't know.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.941
Maybe I want to satisfy myself

20:51.041 --> 20:54.045
that the place is nothing more
than it appears to be.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.822
- Would you take me out there?
- No.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.075
The law has placed it off-limits.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.787
Wouldn't be very seemly for
a minister to break the law, would it?

21:02.887 --> 21:06.608
No. Maybe I can come back some other time.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.228
Shall we go along now?

21:37.046 --> 21:38.698
Ah, I thought that'd be you.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.141
Good evening.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.787
That organ playin' must take a long time.
You've been gone most the whole day.

21:44.887 --> 21:51.127
I went for a long drive in the country
with my new boss, an elderly minister.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.295
Oh, ho.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.898
That must have been a kick in the head.

21:57.358 --> 22:00.453
I learned that
from my other boarder, Mr. Linden.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.847
Did you get your supper?

22:02.947 --> 22:05.182
Oh, I forgot.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.768
Well, this ain't no boardinghouse,

22:07.868 --> 22:11.147
but I got some coffee
and sandwich makings left.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.649
I could bring you some up after a while.

22:13.749 --> 22:17.319
Good. I'll be taking one of those baths
you're so generous with.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.988
Take as many as you want.

22:19.088 --> 22:22.262
I ain't one to make a fuss
about a thing like that.

23:09.305 --> 23:11.307
Come in, Mrs. Thomas.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.564
Oh, uh, just a minute.

23:35.456 --> 23:37.424
I thought you were Mrs. Thomas!

23:38.000 --> 23:40.719
Yeah, I, uh...
I wondered when you asked me in.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.531
I'm John Linden.
I'm your neighbor across the hall.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.408
- Nice to meet you. Would you excuse...
- Hey, I, uh...

23:46.508 --> 23:49.307
- I was just wondering...
- Just stand right there.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.315
I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Mary Henry.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.109
Yeah, I know.

24:20.209 --> 24:24.321
I, uh... I heard you tell Mrs. Thomas
you haven't ate anything yet, huh?

24:24.421 --> 24:28.909
I just thought, bein' neighborly and all...
I haven't eaten anything either.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.954
I just thought I'd ask you out to dinner.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.789
That's very thoughtful,
but I can't accept.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.876
I know we haven't met or anything yet,
but I just thought...

24:36.976 --> 24:39.211
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me.

24:39.311 --> 24:43.424
Look, there's a real nice restaurant
right down the street, and I thought...

24:43.524 --> 24:46.385
I'm the kind of guy
who doesn't like to eat by himself.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.988
I've made arrangements
to eat in my room tonight.

24:49.822 --> 24:53.076
Hey, if, uh, you change your mind,
just holler.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.747
Looks kind of lonesome in here.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.924
Good night, Mr. Linden.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.734
Miss Henry?

26:25.834 --> 26:27.507
It's Mrs. Thomas.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.766
Hmm.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.608
Who's the man in the hall?

26:50.567 --> 26:51.864
The...

26:52.194 --> 26:56.432
Oh, you must mean Mr. Linden.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.101
He has the room across the hall.

26:59.201 --> 27:02.455
No. I mean the other one.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.465
There is no other.

27:06.416 --> 27:09.194
Me and you and Mr. Linden.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.822
Us three is all there is in this house.

27:11.922 --> 27:14.220
B-But you must have passed him out there.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.390
You're needin' this food.

27:17.928 --> 27:21.915
Goin' without eatin'
makes you jumpy sometimes.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.960
Maybe you heard
the boards pop or somethin'.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.463
These old houses
creak worse than my knees.

27:27.563 --> 27:31.568
I didn't hear him, Mrs. Thomas. I saw him.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.242
Now, don't talk that way.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.909
I don't sleep so good as it is.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.937
It's these old houses. They...

27:44.037 --> 27:48.008
They're big enough so that
you could hide a man in every corner.

27:50.919 --> 27:54.323
You just gotta not let
your imagination run away with you.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.926
- Are you going out there?
- Well, of course.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.866
There's nobody there.

28:22.409 --> 28:26.505
Now you just go
and eat that sandwich I made for you.

28:27.789 --> 28:31.360
Don't drink the coffee
if coffee keeps you awake.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.837
It won't.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.642
Coffee never keeps me awake.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.222
Well, good morning.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.038
I heard your alarm. I knew you'd be up.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.373
- Guess what I got.
- I can't imagine.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.710
Oh, just what it takes
to start the day off right.

30:11.810 --> 30:15.339
I make it in my room.
It saves me havin' to get dressed up.

30:15.439 --> 30:18.592
I guess I had to get dressed
to come over here anyway.

30:18.692 --> 30:20.802
Oh! It looks just like what I need.

30:20.902 --> 30:24.748
Well, then two cups of coffee comin' up.

30:28.118 --> 30:29.711
Say, uh,

30:30.537 --> 30:34.441
I guess you took it wrong last night
about me comin' to your door and all.

30:34.541 --> 30:37.486
I'm not a very sociable person ordinarily.

30:37.586 --> 30:39.821
How can I resist an inducement like this?

30:39.921 --> 30:41.406
A what?

30:41.506 --> 30:43.659
Come on. I don't know all those big words.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.787
I'm just an ordinary guy
who works in a warehouse, that's all.

30:46.887 --> 30:49.748
I make pretty good money though. Hey.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.519
I got a couple of shots left over from
last night. Want a little bit in yours?

30:53.619 --> 30:57.756
No, thanks. It's not the recommended
breakfast for a church organist.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.675
Oh, is that what you do?

30:59.775 --> 31:02.386
You mean they pay somebody
to play the organ in church?

31:02.486 --> 31:04.363
Some churches do.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.266
Hey, I hope you don't mind about this.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.518
I just didn't know
you were a church woman.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.437
To me a church is just
a place of business.

31:12.537 --> 31:15.649
- Well, that's a funny way to look at it.
- Why?

31:15.749 --> 31:18.360
People seem shocked because
I took a job in a church,

31:18.460 --> 31:21.321
and I regard it simply as a job.

31:21.421 --> 31:24.283
I'm a professional organist
and I play for pay, that's all.

31:25.283 --> 31:28.228
Thinkin' like that,
don't that give you nightmares?

31:29.596 --> 31:31.894
Strange you should say that.

31:32.474 --> 31:35.794
As a matter of fact...
not for that reason, mind you...

31:35.894 --> 31:39.673
but I had
the strangest feeling last night.

31:39.773 --> 31:43.093
Yeah, I had kind of a lost night myself.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.991
That's funny.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.832
The world is so different in the daylight.

31:49.783 --> 31:53.378
But in the dark,
your fantasies get so out of hand.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.758
But in the daylight,
everything falls back into place again.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.712
Let's have no more nights.

32:02.129 --> 32:06.009
Or let's make them more interesting, huh?

32:08.427 --> 32:10.579
Say, how'd you get to be
a church organist?

32:10.679 --> 32:12.581
I studied it in college.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.308
I could've gone to college.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.585
I used to play pretty good football,

32:16.685 --> 32:19.588
but they wanted me
to take a lot of classes and things.

32:19.688 --> 32:23.568
- They're that way.
- I'm just as smart as the next guy.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.845
But I just didn't dig
what they were teachin' in school.

32:26.945 --> 32:31.183
And the thing I hated most
was "principal products."

32:31.283 --> 32:32.601
Principal products?

32:32.701 --> 32:37.047
You know, like, uh,
"The principal products of Brazil are..."

32:38.081 --> 32:39.549
Oh, geez.

32:40.167 --> 32:43.303
Coffee beans, snake oil.
You know, like that.

32:43.903 --> 32:46.073
When I was in school,
I couldn't care less.

32:46.173 --> 32:48.283
The only thing I cared about was girls.

32:48.383 --> 32:51.027
Didn't they offer a course in that?

32:51.127 --> 32:53.971
If they would've done that,
I would've graduated.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.518
What's the matter?
Can you still taste the coffee?

32:58.618 --> 33:01.096
Come on.
What do you think, I'm an alcoholic?

33:01.196 --> 33:04.257
I just like to start the day off
in a good mood, that's all.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.718
You must be hilarious by noon.

33:06.818 --> 33:11.039
I'm just the kind of a guy employers want.
You know, the happy worker.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.810
Come on.
Didn't I make your morning happier?

33:14.910 --> 33:17.562
This morning you're exactly what I needed.

33:17.662 --> 33:21.417
You're gonna need me in the evenin' too.
You just don't know it yet.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.819
I'll rinse off these cups.

33:23.919 --> 33:27.173
Ah, no, no.
Just spoils the flavor for tomorrow.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.258
Well, thank you for the coffee.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.827
It was unsanitary, but delicious.

33:31.927 --> 33:36.524
Well, uh, should've put some of
the germ killer inside.

33:37.599 --> 33:40.335
Well, I hate to leave so early.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.984
Think you can get through the door?

33:43.438 --> 33:45.340
You got the wrong impression of me.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.301
Well, I meant because
you have so many things to carry.

33:48.401 --> 33:52.347
Oh. Like I said, I hate to leave.

33:52.447 --> 33:56.143
It's been a pleasure, Mr. Linden,
but I'm sure you have to get to work.

33:56.243 --> 33:57.477
- Don't you?
- Nope.

33:57.577 --> 34:00.501
I have the whole day free for shopping.

34:11.715 --> 34:14.034
Does the hem hang right in back?

34:14.135 --> 34:16.204
We might change the hemline a little.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.165
The drape is just fine.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.041
Otherwise it looks very nice.

34:20.141 --> 34:24.254
I'm sure it isn't very chic to take
the second dress, but I like it.

34:24.353 --> 34:27.949
We alter it a little here
to make it straight all the way around.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.822
Do you want to go back
to your dressing room?

35:51.983 --> 35:55.863
I like it fine. I believe I'll have you
deliver the dress, if you don't mind.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.370
I did say I'd take it.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.883
What's the matter with her?

36:20.345 --> 36:22.473
What's the matter with everyone?

36:25.934 --> 36:27.902
Why don't they answer me?

38:10.179 --> 38:13.031
- What is it?
- That man!

38:13.958 --> 38:17.320
I didn't mean any harm.
I just stopped to get a drink.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.490
No. No.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.342
It was that man.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.311
That man!

38:27.722 --> 38:29.374
There was someone else there!

38:29.474 --> 38:31.459
That strange man was there!

38:31.559 --> 38:33.461
Now, look. You've had a fright.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.965
Hysteria won't solve anything.
Now control yourself.

38:37.065 --> 38:39.592
Look, I'm Dr. Samuels.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.637
My office is right across
the street there.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.364
You've had a shock.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.684
If you would like my assistance,
I'll be glad to offer it.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.310
Thank you.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.629
- Could I come with you now?
- Certainly.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.417
I'll take her over to my office.
We'll see that she's all right.

38:57.293 --> 38:58.670
My purse.

39:10.139 --> 39:13.484
It was more than just
not being able to hear anything,

39:14.602 --> 39:16.730
or make contact with anyone.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.781
It was as though...

39:20.692 --> 39:23.741
as though for a time I didn't exist.

39:25.113 --> 39:27.741
As though I had no place in the world,

39:28.783 --> 39:31.286
no part of the life around me.

39:32.120 --> 39:35.920
And then you saw this... this man?

39:36.708 --> 39:37.880
Yes.

39:40.587 --> 39:44.365
You'll excuse my back, but I wanted
to get some of that written down.

39:44.465 --> 39:46.701
I must have been talking for an hour.

39:46.801 --> 39:50.271
Anything else?
Anything you haven't told me?

39:50.805 --> 39:54.083
That's all there is.
That's the whole story.

39:54.183 --> 39:56.753
He's been following me.
That's all there is to it.

39:56.853 --> 39:59.447
It isn't that simple though, is it?

39:59.981 --> 40:00.965
What do you mean?

40:01.065 --> 40:03.218
He couldn't have been
in the park this afternoon,

40:03.318 --> 40:05.220
or one of us men would've seen him.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.788
And that night in the hallway,

40:07.155 --> 40:11.100
you said yourself the landlady came up
a minute later, and she didn't see him?

40:11.200 --> 40:12.769
What are you driving at?

40:12.869 --> 40:16.940
It's been less than a week since you
were in a car that crashed into the river.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.692
How you got out of that
no one seems to know.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.654
But that experience must have been
a serious emotional shock.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.865
You think I imagined all of it, don't you?
You think I'm insane?

40:25.965 --> 40:28.243
I didn't say that. I don't mean that.

40:28.343 --> 40:31.287
I'm a competent person.
If anything, I'm a realist.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.581
I'm not given to imagining anything.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.583
Hogwash.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.044
All of us imagine things.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.547
Have you ever heard two men
talking behind your back

40:40.647 --> 40:42.820
and imagined they were talking about you?

40:43.816 --> 40:45.927
Have you never imagined
you saw someone you knew,

40:46.027 --> 40:48.930
and walked up to them and found
they were a perfect stranger?

40:49.030 --> 40:52.350
- I don't see what this has to do with it.
- The point is this.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.269
Our imaginations play tricks on us.

40:54.369 --> 40:58.106
They often misinterpret
what we see and hear. Do you agree?

40:58.206 --> 41:00.149
I suppose so.

41:00.249 --> 41:04.028
If that can happen in ordinary times,
go a step further.

41:04.128 --> 41:08.491
Look what can happen in a high fever,
or following a serious emotional shock.

41:08.591 --> 41:12.287
It doesn't seem possible
that I could have imagined all of it.

41:12.387 --> 41:16.124
Does this man, this figure,
resemble anyone you've ever known?

41:16.224 --> 41:18.418
- An acquaintance, or your father?
- No.

41:18.518 --> 41:22.589
- Have a boyfriend here or back home?
- No, no desire for one.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.987
- Never?
- No.

41:26.150 --> 41:30.722
I'm surprised to find myself
saying that, but it's true.

41:30.822 --> 41:34.309
I have no desire for
the close company of other people.

41:34.409 --> 41:36.582
Have you always felt this way?

41:38.746 --> 41:40.315
I... I don't know.

41:40.415 --> 41:43.318
Don't you want to join
in the things that other people do,

41:43.418 --> 41:45.111
share the experiences of other people?

41:45.211 --> 41:48.573
I don't seem capable
of being very close to people.

41:48.673 --> 41:52.702
I do feel that perhaps I'm trying
to reach out for those other things.

41:52.802 --> 41:55.021
Do you feel guilty wanting them?

41:55.930 --> 41:58.041
I don't understand you.

41:58.141 --> 42:01.961
I'm not a psychiatrist, and perhaps
I'm being clumsy at all this,

42:02.061 --> 42:05.673
but I am suggesting that perhaps
this figure represents a guilt feeling.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.491
Oh, that's ridiculous!

42:07.942 --> 42:10.786
Maybe. Frankly, I don't know.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.057
Well, I know one thing.

42:14.157 --> 42:18.519
If my imagination is playing tricks on me,
I'm going to put a stop to it.

42:18.619 --> 42:21.481
You're a very strong-willed person,
aren't you?

42:21.581 --> 42:23.629
I survive, if that's what you mean.

42:24.292 --> 42:27.362
That old pavilion out by the lake.

42:27.462 --> 42:30.306
Somehow you associate it
with all this, don't you?

42:31.090 --> 42:35.140
I could go out there.
I could put an end to that too.

42:36.429 --> 42:38.978
- I could go out there...
- Now don't be hasty.

42:39.766 --> 42:44.045
If it is all in my imagination,
I could put a stop to it.

42:44.145 --> 42:47.006
Maybe. But at least someone
should be with you. I can't possibly...

42:47.106 --> 42:50.110
As you say, Doctor,
I'm a person of strong will.

42:50.693 --> 42:53.304
And the time to go out there is now.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.908
And if I have to, I can go alone.

47:35.936 --> 47:37.313
Say, uh,

47:38.397 --> 47:40.758
I don't wanna get turned down again.

47:40.858 --> 47:43.386
I was thinkin'
of askin' you out to dinner.

47:43.486 --> 47:45.846
I stopped for a bite to eat on the way.

47:45.946 --> 47:49.684
Anyway, I have to practice
at the church this evening.

47:49.784 --> 47:52.144
Look, uh, how's about if
I pick you up afterward?

47:52.244 --> 47:55.064
We'll go someplace and dance or somethin'.

47:55.164 --> 47:58.088
I'm sorry. I'm not much for dancing.

48:00.252 --> 48:02.254
Uh, hey, uh,

48:02.671 --> 48:05.116
you mind if I ask you a question?

48:05.216 --> 48:07.201
I won't know until I hear it.

48:07.301 --> 48:09.036
What, are you afraid of men?

48:09.136 --> 48:11.622
No, I'm not afraid of men.

48:11.722 --> 48:15.647
Well, you seem sort of cold.

48:16.435 --> 48:19.880
This morning when I brought you
the coffee, you were friendly.

48:19.980 --> 48:22.028
This morning I needed company.

48:23.067 --> 48:25.695
Well, maybe you'll need company tonight.

48:26.404 --> 48:28.748
It's better than walkin' home alone.

48:30.199 --> 48:32.998
Yes, it is.

48:33.953 --> 48:36.063
I should be finished around 9:00.

48:36.163 --> 48:39.042
- Will that be all right?
- That's okay by me.

48:40.501 --> 48:44.280
Say, uh, I'll see you in church, huh?

52:09.543 --> 52:12.446
Profane! Sacrilege!

52:12.546 --> 52:15.324
What are you playing in this church?

52:15.424 --> 52:19.395
Have you no respect?
Do you feel no reverence?

52:20.763 --> 52:24.734
Then I feel sorry for you
and your lack of soul.

52:25.142 --> 52:27.836
This organ, the music of this church,

52:27.936 --> 52:31.298
these things have meaning
and significance to us.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.821
I assumed they did to you.

52:34.568 --> 52:36.762
But without this awareness,

52:36.862 --> 52:40.332
I'm afraid you cannot be our organist.

52:40.658 --> 52:44.083
In conscience, I must ask you to resign.

53:08.394 --> 53:11.088
That does not mean
that I am abandoning you,

53:11.188 --> 53:13.340
nor should you turn
your back on the church.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.614
There is help here,
and I urge you to accept it.

53:46.557 --> 53:49.460
Well, hi there. I've been waitin'
an awful long time for you.

53:49.560 --> 53:52.212
My car's over there.
I know the right place to go.

54:18.380 --> 54:20.491
What's the matter? Don't you drink either?

54:20.591 --> 54:23.410
- Not really.
- Not really.

54:23.510 --> 54:26.730
How else is there if you don't
drink really? Answer me that, hmm?

54:27.639 --> 54:33.146
Now me, I not only drink really,
I really drink.

54:39.109 --> 54:41.637
What's the matter?
Don't you like the music either?

54:41.737 --> 54:44.098
- I like it fine.
- You don't like it.

54:44.198 --> 54:48.727
You don't like to dance,
and you don't like to drink.

54:48.827 --> 54:52.147
You don't like for a man
to hold you close. That's it, isn't it?

54:52.247 --> 54:55.922
- I didn't say that.
- You haven't said anything all evening.

54:59.171 --> 55:02.675
Why don't I go play that song again,
you like it so much.

55:08.347 --> 55:10.999
Hey, Johnny, who's the doll?

55:11.099 --> 55:12.626
Nobody you know, Chip.

55:12.726 --> 55:15.170
Oh, come on now.
You been holdin' out on me.

55:15.270 --> 55:18.632
That's not the kind of pig
you usually drag around.

55:18.732 --> 55:22.010
You quit lickin' your chops.
She's outta your class.

55:22.110 --> 55:23.657
You wanna bet?

55:24.738 --> 55:26.331
Lay off, huh?

55:27.282 --> 55:30.686
- I got somethin' on the stove there, man.
- I'll help you put it over.

55:30.786 --> 55:34.165
I don't want her to think
I even know creeps like you.

55:35.874 --> 55:37.376
Good luck.

55:41.421 --> 55:43.490
Meet someone you know?

55:43.590 --> 55:44.887
Yeah.

55:45.300 --> 55:48.645
He's a... college fella.

55:50.222 --> 55:53.647
He told me about this girl
that's been wantin' to meet me.

55:55.102 --> 55:58.672
- Wanted me to meet her.
- What'd you tell him?

55:58.772 --> 56:02.026
I said, how could I?
You're my date, you know.

56:06.613 --> 56:10.934
Said you, uh, didn't seem
to enjoy my company much.

56:11.034 --> 56:13.061
Oh, that's not true.

56:13.161 --> 56:16.523
I really appreciate
you taking me out this evening.

56:16.623 --> 56:19.217
I'd had a miserable night if you hadn't.

56:19.585 --> 56:24.056
Ah. Forget it. Come on, here.
Join the party. Drink up.

56:30.095 --> 56:33.123
I paid good money for that stuff.
It ain't poison.

56:33.223 --> 56:35.772
I'm sorry if I annoy you.

56:37.311 --> 56:39.421
You know, I don't get you.

56:39.521 --> 56:43.091
First you stand me off.
Well, that's okay. That's class.

56:43.191 --> 56:45.660
Figure you got somethin',
you're just holdin' back.

56:46.153 --> 56:49.327
Now everything I say is okay.
You're a mouse.

56:50.073 --> 56:52.326
Yesterday I didn't care.

56:53.160 --> 56:55.229
Tonight I wanna be with you.

56:55.329 --> 56:57.689
With me, or just with anybody?

56:57.789 --> 56:59.086
With you.

57:05.339 --> 57:08.263
Why don't you thaw out, hmm?

57:11.053 --> 57:15.274
- You wanna be alone. I'll leave you alone.
- No, I don't. No, I...

57:15.766 --> 57:18.519
I like being with you, really I do.

57:19.269 --> 57:21.317
I don't want to be alone tonight.

57:21.855 --> 57:23.698
I want to be near you.

57:32.282 --> 57:35.331
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.

57:45.837 --> 57:48.215
Why don't you and me get outta here, huh?

57:48.757 --> 57:52.057
You know, my room's only
a couple of feet from yours.

57:52.844 --> 57:55.848
Ain't likely to get
very far from me, are ya?

58:15.433 --> 58:17.519
- Oh, geez.
- Shh!

58:17.619 --> 58:20.564
- You'll wake Mrs. Thomas.
- Ah, that old girl lives in the back.

58:20.664 --> 58:23.117
She won't hear nothin'.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.097
Honey...

58:34.845 --> 58:37.974
You don't wanna go in there
all by yourself, do you?

58:39.391 --> 58:42.520
It's dark, and it's lonely in there.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.423
You don't have to be alone tonight.

58:46.523 --> 58:50.153
Just let me come in a while.
Let me stay with you, huh?

58:51.153 --> 58:53.472
Look, you don't wanna be alone, do ya?

58:53.572 --> 58:54.869
No.

59:06.001 --> 59:09.029
- I'm sorry, I...
- Look, look, honey.

59:09.129 --> 59:13.851
Honey, you asked me in.
You must like me a little, huh?

59:42.120 --> 59:43.918
Hey, what's the matter with you?

59:47.375 --> 59:49.343
What's goin' on around here?

59:50.754 --> 59:52.614
What's the matter with you?

59:52.714 --> 59:54.616
That man's after me.

59:54.716 --> 59:56.618
You gotta stop him! He's after me again.

59:56.718 --> 59:58.996
- I'm gettin' outta here.
- You don't have to go!

59:59.096 --> 01:00:02.290
Not me, sister. That's just what I need,

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.960
gettin' mixed up with some girl
that's off her rocker!

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.156
I don't wanna be left alone!

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:02.409
What'd you find out, Doctor?

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.336
Not very much, I'm afraid.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:09.257
I am sure glad you just happened around.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:13.904
I was gonna call somebody,
but I was afraid I'd have to pay the bill.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.972
I came on purpose.

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:20.077
I've been thinking about her
ever since she left my office yesterday.

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:22.412
What's she been up to?

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:25.874
Only the devil knows that.

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:30.837
I heard her movin' things
all around that room all night.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:33.340
Never heard such goings-on.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.009
And she wouldn't let me
in her room this morning.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.261
- She's a strange one.
- Mmm.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.955
She absolutely refuses my help.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.183
I can't say that I blame her.

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:46.561
There's something about her
that completely baffles me.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:51.212
I've urged her to call upon me if she
feels she needs help, and I hope she will.

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:53.902
I can't let her stay in this house.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.695
You won't have to worry about that.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.656
She's determined to leave the city,

01:01:57.756 --> 01:02:00.450
and she wants to get away
as soon as possible.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.723
I hope she does leave.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:07.183
I hope she can.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.959
Decided to leave, did ya?

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.652
Where ya goin'?

01:02:57.315 --> 01:03:01.536
I can't refund none of your week's rent
when you go off like that.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:04:01.005
Sounds like your transmission.
Can you pull it up on the rack?

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:15.894
Okay, fine.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:19.506
- Will it take long?
- Well, I have to check it first.

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:21.279
Would you like to get out?

01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:25.617
- May I just sit here?
- Sure. Suit yourself.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.219
When is the next eastbound bus?

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:54.932
When does the next bus leave?
I must get on it!

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:12.908
I want to get out of here.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:16.199
I want to get away from here.

01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:34.968
Eastbound bus, now loading,

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:37.975
gate nine.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:45.270
Don't close it! Wait! Wait, wait!

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:48.191
Let me in. You've gotta let me in.
I gotta get on that train.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:52.216
I gotta get away from here.
Please! Please!

01:08:57.133 --> 01:09:00.854
You hear me. You can hear me.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.652
Why can't I hear anything?

01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:22.455
Will you help me? I need your help.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.915
J-Just a moment, please.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:50.770
Why can't anybody hear me?

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:44.658
I... I came to you, Doctor,

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:48.586
because you're my... my last hope.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:53.941
I-I-If you don't help me,
I... I have to go back there.

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:58.296
He's... He's trying
to take me back somewhere.

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:04.474
Doctor, you've got to tell me what to do.

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:42.565
Her car's still over there,

01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:46.019
and then there are footprints
leading up to here.

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:57.781
And then nothing.

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:25.228
Okay!

01:17:25.558 --> 01:17:29.404
The Buick's right down there.
Bring it on up.
