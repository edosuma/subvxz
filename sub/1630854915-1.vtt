01:22.851 --> 01:24.021
- Hi!

01:24.147 --> 01:26.624
- Hey, thanks for being
able to do this today.

01:26.707 --> 01:28.992
Embargo logistics
appreciates your openness.

01:29.075 --> 01:33.077
- Yeah. You're welcome.
I'm glad I could do this.

01:33.160 --> 01:37.078
- So, why don't we just go ahead
and start off with some basics.

01:37.161 --> 01:38.530
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

01:38.613 --> 01:42.374
- Well, I have a bachelor's
degree in business management.

01:42.457 --> 01:46.174
I'm a fast learner and
I'm driven for success.

01:46.257 --> 01:49.538
- All right... All good traits.

01:49.621 --> 01:51.331
What about some weaknesses?

01:51.414 --> 01:53.154
What are some things
that might hold you back

01:53.237 --> 01:56.031
from being a really good sales agent?

01:56.114 --> 01:59.312
- The only thing I can
think of in terms of that

01:59.395 --> 02:02.162
would be my inability to give up.

02:02.245 --> 02:04.915
I can sometimes get upset at myself

02:04.998 --> 02:08.245
if I don't remember to upsell the customer.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.068
- Okay.

02:10.151 --> 02:12.457
- I also think I have a
problem comparing...

02:12.540 --> 02:15.200
(Baby crying)

02:17.921 --> 02:18.802
(Glass shattering)

02:18.885 --> 02:20.601
Oh my god!

02:20.684 --> 02:22.202
(Baby crying) I'm so sorry!

02:22.285 --> 02:23.577
Can we reschedule this?

02:24.198 --> 02:25.406
- Yeah, of course.

02:25.489 --> 02:28.335
Obviously, you gotta take
care of some things at home first.

02:28.418 --> 02:30.748
- Again, I am so sorry.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.626
(Sighs)

02:53.098 --> 02:54.409
- Hey, Jon!

02:54.492 --> 02:55.281
- Flint?

02:55.364 --> 03:00.693
- Yes, I'm here to apply for
the sales 'idiot' position please?

03:00.776 --> 03:01.863
Do you have a pen?

03:02.424 --> 03:03.612
- Wha-, no!

03:04.500 --> 03:05.945
- Here you go!

03:07.680 --> 03:09.820
See? I can sell you anything.

03:09.903 --> 03:12.144
I just sold you this pen.

03:12.227 --> 03:13.242
When do I start?

03:13.802 --> 03:16.252
(Chuckling) There's that
dry British humor again.

03:16.335 --> 03:18.762
Haven't you learned anything
from going over to the states?

03:18.845 --> 03:20.218
- Yeah, yeah.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.897
Look, how else am I
supposed to get a hold of you?

03:22.980 --> 03:25.551
You're always at work, you never pick up.

03:25.634 --> 03:27.379
When are we supposed to hang out, man?

03:27.462 --> 03:28.511
It's been a while.

03:28.594 --> 03:29.562
- I don't know.

03:29.645 --> 03:31.636
Sorry for giving you the
cold shoulder, though.

03:31.719 --> 03:33.925
- You need to get out of there, stat!

03:34.008 --> 03:37.698
Those fluorescent lights
are melting your brain.

03:37.781 --> 03:40.767
- (Chuckling) Right, yeah.

03:40.850 --> 03:44.266
- I know a guy who actually used
to work at a place like that once

03:44.349 --> 03:47.465
and the fluorescents really made him,

03:47.548 --> 03:49.266
with the help of hallucinogens,

03:49.349 --> 03:52.363
go crazy and he actually
killed the entire workforce.

03:52.446 --> 03:53.423
Yeah, no.

03:53.506 --> 03:55.044
No, you've been listening
to Chuck Higgins again,

03:55.127 --> 03:55.872
haven't you?

03:56.098 --> 03:58.011
- Are you kidding? Do I ever stop?

03:58.094 --> 04:01.253
'The truth beyond' is
the best radio station

04:01.336 --> 04:03.503
on the western coast.

04:03.586 --> 04:04.729
(Sighs)

04:04.812 --> 04:06.323
- Whatever, I gotta get back to work.

04:06.406 --> 04:08.400
- All right, fine.

04:08.483 --> 04:10.417
Just call me back when you can hang.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.602
I don't want... - Mr. Child!

04:14.650 --> 04:16.267
- Mr. Snyder, what a surprise.

04:17.903 --> 04:19.040
- What're you doin'?

04:19.360 --> 04:22.305
- Um... hey?

04:24.493 --> 04:25.867
- Uh...

04:25.950 --> 04:27.109
Get back to work!

04:28.261 --> 04:30.240
- Seriously, I gotta go.

04:30.323 --> 04:32.295
I'm going over to my
parents later on tonight.

04:32.378 --> 04:33.890
The general's coming over.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.338
- Ah, yes!

04:35.421 --> 04:38.059
Commander daddio.

04:38.142 --> 04:39.437
- He's not my dad.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.660
- Yeah, I know.

04:40.743 --> 04:42.827
Why does he even bother coming round?

04:42.910 --> 04:45.954
It's been, what? Once every two months?

04:46.569 --> 04:48.854
- Closer to three, actually.

04:48.937 --> 04:50.891
I don't know. They have him doing some kind

04:50.974 --> 04:53.774
of crazy secretive thing over at the base.

04:53.857 --> 04:55.333
I can't help you.

04:55.416 --> 04:58.452
- Right, okay. Well, send him my love!

04:58.535 --> 04:59.423
(Sarcastic laughing)

04:59.506 --> 05:00.760
Yeah, okay.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.322
I'll talk to you later.

05:07.346 --> 05:08.763
Here goes nothing.

05:35.455 --> 05:37.781
(Police radio chatter)

05:38.742 --> 05:39.591
- [Officer] All units.

05:39.674 --> 05:43.362
Suspect has been spotted
heading south on Ripley boulevard.

05:43.445 --> 05:46.232
It is believed that he is
heading toward his residence.

05:46.315 --> 05:48.494
E.t.a. Seven minutes.

05:53.421 --> 05:56.079
(Light music)

05:58.632 --> 06:01.318
- Boo-ya! Total supremacy!

06:01.401 --> 06:02.720
- Calm down, your highness.

06:02.803 --> 06:04.069
Just a game.

06:04.941 --> 06:07.724
- Woah, hold up!

06:07.807 --> 06:09.770
Just a game?

06:10.610 --> 06:12.535
Mario's just a game.

06:13.292 --> 06:16.208
Space invaders is just a game.

06:16.291 --> 06:18.387
Halo infinite?

06:18.470 --> 06:20.566
Now, that's a way of life, Jon.

06:20.649 --> 06:22.090
Of life.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.597
Life!

06:24.315 --> 06:25.497
- You need to get out more.

06:25.580 --> 06:26.676
You do know that.

06:26.759 --> 06:27.560
- That's far.

06:31.663 --> 06:34.573
How'd it go with the commander?

06:34.656 --> 06:36.863
- I don't know, he's late... Again.

06:36.946 --> 06:40.039
Here, take a look.

06:41.409 --> 06:43.590
It's been like this for the last 20 minutes

06:44.124 --> 06:46.409
she made a really
delicious-looking tenderloin,

06:46.492 --> 06:50.039
and now it is old and it is cold.

06:50.122 --> 06:52.289
- Should've just ate without the man.

06:52.372 --> 06:54.766
- Well, at any rate, we're gonna
have to figure something El...

06:54.849 --> 06:55.975
(door unlocking) Here we go.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.235
(Distant police sirens blaring)

07:03.040 --> 07:04.240
- [Jon's mother] What's wrong?

07:06.284 --> 07:07.399
- You both need to hide.

07:07.831 --> 07:09.207
Right now. - [Jon] What?

07:09.290 --> 07:11.844
- Look, we ain't got time
to argue about this, okay?

07:11.927 --> 07:13.895
You need to go and hide right now.

07:13.978 --> 07:14.865
Just do what I said.

07:14.948 --> 07:15.941
Just listen to me!

07:17.987 --> 07:19.469
- What's goin' on?

07:23.900 --> 07:26.376
(Door pounding)

07:27.621 --> 07:28.868
- What's goin' on?

07:28.951 --> 07:30.776
- Whatever happens, I
don't care what you hear.

07:30.859 --> 07:31.835
I don't, whatever.

07:31.918 --> 07:33.538
You just stay put, you understand?

07:33.621 --> 07:35.490
Just stay there, do not move.

07:35.573 --> 07:36.785
You understand?

07:36.868 --> 07:37.997
You understand?

07:42.167 --> 07:44.462
(Door pounding)

07:48.464 --> 07:50.225
Listen, I don't want no trouble, okay?

07:50.308 --> 07:51.437
Just leave me alone.

07:52.581 --> 07:54.141
- [Graham] Open up, this is the police.

07:56.103 --> 07:58.593
(Gunshots firing)

07:58.676 --> 07:59.603
(Man screaming)

07:59.686 --> 08:01.533
- I gotta go help your father!

08:04.895 --> 08:07.578
(Man screaming)

08:19.264 --> 08:20.599
- Are you okay?

08:22.795 --> 08:23.748
- I think they may be gone.

08:23.831 --> 08:24.832
I'm gonna go check.

08:24.915 --> 08:26.239
- Dude, no!

08:26.514 --> 08:28.947
(Approaching footsteps)

08:38.516 --> 08:40.623
- [Graham] Is there any sign of it?

08:42.979 --> 08:45.601
- [Hunter] Not that I can see.

08:45.684 --> 08:47.456
- [Graham] We'll have to come back later.

08:47.539 --> 08:49.129
The cops'll be here any minute.

09:11.116 --> 09:12.094
- Mom?

09:12.177 --> 09:13.296
- I called the police.

09:13.379 --> 09:14.679
What's goin' on right now?

09:20.730 --> 09:22.024
- Oh my god.

09:22.893 --> 09:24.168
-Help's on the way.

09:24.691 --> 09:25.836
- Your mother...

09:25.919 --> 09:27.200
- I don't know, I don't see her anywhere.

09:27.283 --> 09:28.380
- They took her.

09:28.463 --> 09:29.428
- What?

09:29.511 --> 09:30.624
- You gotta find her.

09:30.707 --> 09:31.599
- How?

09:31.682 --> 09:33.323
- You gotta find...

09:34.301 --> 09:35.924
You gotta find the seam.

09:36.007 --> 09:37.222
- I don't understand.

09:37.305 --> 09:38.595
- The seam...

09:38.678 --> 09:41.592
It's in the 'great green beyond'.

09:51.712 --> 09:54.152
(Dry heaving)

09:57.407 --> 09:59.764
- [Police] Police! Hands on your head!

10:05.657 --> 10:08.298
Jonathon, your lawyer is here.

10:08.381 --> 10:10.043
- Who?

10:11.953 --> 10:13.613
- Jonathon?

10:14.002 --> 10:15.442
My name's Henry Talbot.

10:15.525 --> 10:17.134
I'm your family's attorney.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.593
- I didn't realize that we had one.

10:18.676 --> 10:21.872
- Your father was a highly
ranked military official.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.208
When an emergency occurs,
attorneys are made available.

10:26.943 --> 10:29.192
Jonathon, I want to first
express my sympathies

10:29.275 --> 10:31.473
for everything you witnessed tonight.

10:31.556 --> 10:35.611
I can't even imagine what
must be going through your head,

10:37.384 --> 10:41.186
but these officers need
to know why it happened,

10:41.980 --> 10:44.306
and because you're the only survor...

10:46.000 --> 10:48.543
They're going to be
looking at you as a suspect.

10:49.699 --> 10:51.027
- What? I didn't do anything!

10:51.110 --> 10:52.610
- I didn't say you did,

10:52.693 --> 10:54.802
but without a clear idea of what happened,

10:54.885 --> 10:56.166
I can't help you.

10:57.065 --> 11:00.028
You say a few men with guns showed up,

11:00.111 --> 11:03.368
killed your father and kidnapped your mom.

11:03.451 --> 11:04.526
Why?

11:04.609 --> 11:05.673
- I don't know.

11:05.756 --> 11:06.952
- Did they say anything?

11:07.221 --> 11:09.849
Were they looking for
anything in particular?

11:09.932 --> 11:11.963
- Yeah, one of the guys came into the house

11:12.046 --> 11:14.553
asked the other one if
they had found 'it' yet,

11:14.636 --> 11:15.478
whatever 'it' is.

11:15.561 --> 11:16.495
- Okay, good.

11:16.578 --> 11:19.542
Do you have any idea what that was?

11:19.625 --> 11:22.450
- He said something about a 'seam'.

11:22.533 --> 11:23.410
- A seam?

11:24.857 --> 11:26.574
Did he say anything else?

11:26.657 --> 11:27.734
- He didn't exactly have a chance.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.737
- Listen, Jonathon.

11:29.820 --> 11:32.145
We don't have much time.

11:32.228 --> 11:33.919
Did he hand you anything?

11:34.002 --> 11:36.398
A thumbdrive, perhaps?

11:37.769 --> 11:40.839
- Not that I can...
- Look, before he showed up,

11:40.922 --> 11:43.884
he called me and he told me
he was gonna drop something off

11:43.967 --> 11:47.033
at your house, and I think it we find it,

11:47.116 --> 11:49.180
it'll really help your case.

11:51.137 --> 11:54.597
- Hold on, you said that
lawyers were called in

11:54.680 --> 11:55.993
when an emergency occurred.

11:56.076 --> 12:00.490
You said nothing about getting
a call before the emergency.

12:04.137 --> 12:05.206
- Where are you hiding it?

12:07.206 --> 12:08.370
(Exhales)

12:09.867 --> 12:11.932
Not talking, huh?

12:14.087 --> 12:16.331
Figured you might be difficult.

12:16.981 --> 12:19.813
Like father... Like son.

12:21.498 --> 12:23.126
(Gun cocking)

12:24.398 --> 12:25.555
(Gunshot)

12:50.794 --> 12:53.321
- Good evening and
welcome to Seattle KWOR news.

12:53.404 --> 12:55.051
I'm Shawn Callaway.

12:55.134 --> 12:57.071
A local man suspected of a double homicide

12:57.154 --> 12:58.464
was brought in for questioning

12:58.547 --> 13:00.634
after police discovered
the grisly aftermath

13:00.717 --> 13:01.731
of a deadly shooting

13:01.814 --> 13:03.208
at his parents' residence.

13:03.291 --> 13:06.363
His stepfather, Samuel MacArthur
was found dead at the scene.

13:06.846 --> 13:09.113
His mother is still missing
and presumed dead.

13:09.196 --> 13:10.664
Now, while being held for questioning,

13:10.747 --> 13:13.729
Mr. Child somehow fired a
round at his family's lawyer

13:13.812 --> 13:15.440
before escaping through a window.

13:15.523 --> 13:17.698
Police are currently on
the lookout for Mr. Child,

13:17.781 --> 13:20.238
who is considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.367
If you, or anybody you know spots him,

13:22.450 --> 13:23.829
police say do not approach him.

13:23.912 --> 13:27.142
We'll have more on this story
as it develops, so stay with us.

13:41.708 --> 13:45.352
- Jon, dude, what the
hell is going on, man?

13:45.435 --> 13:47.443
You're all over the news!

13:48.554 --> 13:52.008
They're saying that you're a
crazy, deranged psychopath

13:52.091 --> 13:54.186
who's killed your entire family!

13:55.103 --> 13:56.619
- Yeah, well you know I didn't do it.

13:56.702 --> 13:57.860
- Of course, man,

13:57.943 --> 13:59.986
but where the hell are you anyway,

14:00.069 --> 14:02.557
and why did you run from the police?

14:02.640 --> 14:04.051
- Because I don't know who to trust.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.354
Anyways, I'm outside my house right now.

14:05.437 --> 14:06.855
Take a look.

14:08.050 --> 14:10.598
It looks like the cops are patrolling
the house just in case I ever come back,

14:10.681 --> 14:13.025
but I have to get back to the back yard.

14:13.108 --> 14:17.295
- Okay, but why?

14:17.378 --> 14:19.650
- Before he died, the general
said he hid something for me

14:19.733 --> 14:21.813
in 'the great green beyond'.

14:22.103 --> 14:26.769
- Well, are you sure that's
not just a lack of blood talking?

14:28.209 --> 14:29.912
Sorry, I'm a jerk

14:29.995 --> 14:32.204
but the question's still important.

14:32.287 --> 14:34.443
- 'The great green beyond' was
something that my real dad came up with,

14:34.526 --> 14:36.766
I didn't even know that
the general knew about it,

14:36.849 --> 14:40.642
but my dad was into gardening
and to get me into it as well,

14:40.725 --> 14:42.966
he would hide things in the garden

14:43.049 --> 14:44.744
and say that I had to go find it

14:44.827 --> 14:46.802
by going into the 'great green beyond'.

14:48.003 --> 14:50.150
Whatever the general hid
that everybody seems to want

14:50.233 --> 14:53.282
is in that garden and I have to find it.

14:53.775 --> 14:55.930
- But how will you do it?

15:06.289 --> 15:07.496
- Every couple hours, the cop

15:07.579 --> 15:09.218
gets out of the car to patrol the area.

15:09.301 --> 15:10.744
So, I only have a couple minutes.

15:10.936 --> 15:12.490
- Can I just say...

15:12.573 --> 15:14.736
You're nuts, bro!

15:41.806 --> 15:43.684
You need to find out what's going on

15:43.767 --> 15:46.056
on that drive, asap.

15:46.139 --> 15:47.825
- So, I have a huge favor.

15:47.908 --> 15:49.197
You mind if I use your computer?

15:49.280 --> 15:50.936
- Of course, man. Come on over.

15:51.019 --> 15:52.819
- All right, thanks,
man. I'll be right over.

16:11.049 --> 16:12.892
Okay, it's recording.

16:12.975 --> 16:14.097
Do we really have to do this?

16:14.180 --> 16:15.131
- [Flint] Absolutely, man.

16:15.214 --> 16:16.876
What if we end up dead?

16:16.959 --> 16:18.144
We need to document this.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.415
- All right.

16:20.498 --> 16:21.679
My name is Jonathon child

16:21.762 --> 16:24.578
and I am making this video in case of my...

16:24.661 --> 16:26.356
...in case I die.

16:26.439 --> 16:27.847
There's a lot of bad people out there

16:27.930 --> 16:30.131
and they are all looking for this.

16:30.214 --> 16:32.379
Now, I have not looked at this at all,

16:32.462 --> 16:35.425
and I don't even think
I want to, but I have to!

16:35.508 --> 16:36.824
They killed my stepfather over it.

16:36.907 --> 16:37.986
They kidnapped my mom,

16:38.069 --> 16:40.304
and a little bit ago,
they tried to kill me, too.

16:40.387 --> 16:42.890
So, if it's important
enough to spill blood over,

16:42.973 --> 16:45.841
I'm gonna have to create
some kind of backup of it.

16:45.924 --> 16:48.177
- [Flint] Plus, it could self-destruct

16:48.260 --> 16:50.548
once we plug it into the computer.

16:50.631 --> 16:53.101
- It's not 'mission: Impossible', flint.

16:53.184 --> 16:56.912
Anyways, what you're about to
see is not for the faint of heart.

16:56.995 --> 16:59.021
I wouldn't imagine.

16:59.534 --> 17:00.481
Alright.

17:01.936 --> 17:03.396
Let's see what's on here.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.049
- [Flint] What is it?

17:09.132 --> 17:10.446
- Uh, I don't know.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.679
Doesn't seem to be
anything out of the ordinary.

17:12.762 --> 17:14.731
Not exactly super secret spy stuff.

17:14.814 --> 17:17.228
Just a pdf document and some pictures.

17:17.311 --> 17:18.438
- [Flint] Open the pdf.

17:18.664 --> 17:19.628
- [Jon] All right.

17:24.723 --> 17:25.790
All right, what am I even looking at?

17:25.873 --> 17:27.988
- Move over, let me take a look.

17:32.905 --> 17:36.294
Looks like some kind of weird word search.

17:36.377 --> 17:37.525
I mean, no offense, man,

17:37.608 --> 17:40.230
but your folks are being targeted

17:40.313 --> 17:41.849
by something that looks like

17:41.932 --> 17:45.153
you'd find from the
books section in Walmart.

17:45.236 --> 17:47.635
- [Jon] I don't know, it
can't be a word search, man,

17:47.718 --> 17:49.028
because look at the numbers.

17:50.414 --> 17:52.269
- [Flint] Oh yeah, okay.

17:52.352 --> 17:56.844
This looks like some sort of
code that needs to be broken.

17:58.329 --> 17:59.596
- [Jon] What are the images?

18:01.424 --> 18:04.465
- It looks to be mostly
just zoomed-in pictures

18:04.548 --> 18:07.199
of the same code, except for...

18:10.312 --> 18:12.701
Okay, this looks to be
the same Cypher thing,

18:12.784 --> 18:14.830
but the back of the document.

18:14.913 --> 18:16.251
Looks pretty basic,

18:16.334 --> 18:18.689
except for this symbol.

18:20.683 --> 18:24.592
I have no idea what that even is.

18:26.752 --> 18:27.599
- I see a knight,

18:27.682 --> 18:30.041
but other than that, I couldn't
tell you what it means to me.

18:30.124 --> 18:33.278
- [Flint] Wait, I know exactly
who we can ask about this.

18:33.361 --> 18:34.913
- Who?

18:36.466 --> 18:37.370
No.

18:37.453 --> 18:38.834
Flint,

18:38.917 --> 18:39.630
no!

18:59.461 --> 19:00.442
- Good morning, everyone

19:00.525 --> 19:02.634
and welcome back to "the truth beyond".

19:02.717 --> 19:03.802
I'm Chuck Higgins,

19:03.885 --> 19:05.752
and we have a very special episode today,

19:05.835 --> 19:08.097
so strap in, get comfy, and let's chat

19:08.180 --> 19:10.838
about a little something
you may have heard of.

19:10.921 --> 19:12.319
9/11.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.316
I know.

19:13.399 --> 19:16.431
I know, this is one of the theories
that's considered really out there,

19:16.514 --> 19:19.316
like next to the fake moon
landing theories out there,

19:19.399 --> 19:20.666
but hear me out.

19:20.749 --> 19:22.335
We often believe what we see,

19:22.418 --> 19:24.987
because we're accustomed
to believing what we hear.

19:25.070 --> 19:26.196
Well, I stand before you...

19:26.279 --> 19:28.643
Well, I sit before you now

19:28.726 --> 19:30.997
to admit we don't know everything.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.514
Conspiracy theories do sound crazy,

19:33.597 --> 19:35.246
but there is some truth to them.

19:35.329 --> 19:37.767
Dimensions that don't match up;

19:37.850 --> 19:41.843
infrastructures that defied certain
laws of physics during the explosions;

19:41.926 --> 19:44.702
vanishing planes, and most suspiciously,

19:44.785 --> 19:48.884
government officials confiscating
dozens of cameras from citizens

19:48.967 --> 19:50.350
that would have shot the madness

19:50.433 --> 19:53.310
from what would have
been the best vantage point.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.669
Was the footage compromising

19:54.752 --> 19:56.400
some deep secret?

19:56.483 --> 19:58.195
What really happened that day?

19:58.278 --> 20:00.105
It doesn't match up, folks,

20:00.188 --> 20:02.957
and today, we're gonna
clear that up once and for all.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.692
Oh yes, ladies and gentlemen.

20:04.775 --> 20:06.887
The truth is most certainly out there.

20:07.635 --> 20:09.803
- [Richard] Clear for two minutes.

20:10.431 --> 20:11.999
Chuck, there's some kids on the phone

20:12.082 --> 20:13.754
that say they wanna meet you.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.390
They say it's important.

20:16.975 --> 20:18.534
- They say their names?

20:18.617 --> 20:21.844
- Their names are Jonathon
child and Oscar flint, sir.

20:21.927 --> 20:22.900
- Yeah,

20:22.983 --> 20:24.539
I never heard of 'em.

20:24.622 --> 20:25.859
Look, if they wanna talk to me,

20:25.942 --> 20:27.902
they're gonna have to
wait until the show's over.

20:31.750 --> 20:32.964
All right, one last hot take.

20:33.047 --> 20:34.555
Hollywood has been out here for years

20:34.638 --> 20:37.212
making money off the tragedy of 9/11.

20:37.295 --> 20:38.406
People died in real life.

20:38.489 --> 20:41.372
They're spreading awareness, I
get it, but at the same time, like...

20:41.455 --> 20:43.678
Isn't it just kind of weird?

20:43.761 --> 20:45.443
Anyways, that's it for tonight.

20:45.526 --> 20:47.781
Tomorrow, we discuss
another Elvis Presley sighting

20:47.864 --> 20:49.295
and we have an anonymous guest

20:49.378 --> 20:51.085
that claims he knows the real inside scoop

20:51.168 --> 20:53.113
on what happened to Jeffrey Epstein.

20:53.196 --> 20:55.536
Also, a new technique for remote viewing

20:55.619 --> 20:57.936
that's gonna change everything.

20:58.019 --> 20:59.228
It'll be a good one.

20:59.311 --> 21:01.121
So, tune in tomorrow and remember,

21:01.204 --> 21:02.635
if you look hard enough,

21:02.718 --> 21:04.290
the truth is out there.

21:05.911 --> 21:07.361
- [Richard] That's a wrap.

21:07.444 --> 21:10.596
- Again, we're not filming a movie, rich.

21:10.679 --> 21:11.969
Hey, if those guys call back...

21:12.052 --> 21:14.169
- [Richard] They're still on the line.

21:14.252 --> 21:16.256
- They never hung up?

21:16.339 --> 21:17.686
- [Richard] No.

21:17.769 --> 21:18.666
- All right, all right.

21:18.749 --> 21:20.015
The live stream just ended.

21:20.098 --> 21:21.826
Send 'em an invite for a private chat.

21:21.909 --> 21:22.596
I'm gonna talk to 'em.

21:22.679 --> 21:23.853
- [Richard] Yes, sir.

21:27.034 --> 21:28.454
- Hey.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.395
Sorry about that, I just
got out of the studio.

21:30.478 --> 21:32.158
You guys must be dedicated.

21:32.241 --> 21:33.365
How can I help?

21:33.448 --> 21:34.210
- Okay, hi.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.088
My name is Jonathon child.

21:36.171 --> 21:37.990
So, yesterday, a couple of men

21:38.073 --> 21:39.562
broke into my house.

21:39.645 --> 21:41.270
They murdered my stepfather

21:41.353 --> 21:43.196
and they kidnapped my mom

21:43.279 --> 21:46.555
all because they were looking for this.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.598
- What is that?

21:48.681 --> 21:50.797
- Honestly, I was hoping
that you would be able

21:50.880 --> 21:52.444
to tell me that. - I'm flint, by the way.

21:52.527 --> 21:55.031
Huge fan!

21:55.114 --> 21:57.804
- And what's on that?

21:57.887 --> 21:59.004
- Whatever it is

21:59.087 --> 22:01.269
contains a Cypher of some kind,

22:01.352 --> 22:03.228
and from what I could
tell from the Internet,

22:03.311 --> 22:05.407
it's something called a trellis Cypher.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.249
- A trellis?

22:07.332 --> 22:08.872
You sure?

22:08.955 --> 22:09.797
- Well, here.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.362
I can show you some of the files.

22:11.445 --> 22:12.681
Hold on a second.

22:29.161 --> 22:31.042
- Uno momento, fellas.

22:32.677 --> 22:35.040
Uno momento.

22:35.504 --> 22:36.639
Yeah, you're right.

22:36.722 --> 22:39.043
100% a trellis.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.705
There seems to be a
symbol inscribed on the back?

22:44.085 --> 22:45.082
Wait, I...

22:45.165 --> 22:46.184
Where do I know this from?

22:46.267 --> 22:49.382
I think that's a symbol
for the knights of Pythias.

22:49.465 --> 22:50.732
- It could be,

22:50.815 --> 22:52.577
but I mean, what's the knights of...

22:52.660 --> 22:55.084
- you think this is some kind of joke?

22:55.167 --> 22:57.368
- I would not joke about
my stepfather getting killed

22:57.451 --> 22:59.095
and my mother getting kidnapped.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.041
- Okay.

23:00.565 --> 23:02.715
So, do you have any idea what this is?

23:02.798 --> 23:04.128
- No.

23:04.211 --> 23:06.745
- All right, so what you
brought me is a myth.

23:06.828 --> 23:08.811
At least, that's what
the world's considered it

23:08.894 --> 23:10.657
ever since they've heard of the seam.

23:10.740 --> 23:12.525
All right, so the secret seam
has been a popular myth

23:12.608 --> 23:13.428
in some cultures for

23:13.511 --> 23:15.849
as long as I can remember.

23:15.932 --> 23:17.420
The search for the garden of Eden,

23:17.503 --> 23:19.902
of Atlantis, the city of gold,

23:19.985 --> 23:21.240
or the ark of the covenant

23:21.323 --> 23:23.412
are all essentially
trivial easter egg hunts

23:23.495 --> 23:25.061
compared to the seam.

23:25.144 --> 23:27.400
- Yeah, but what is it?

23:27.483 --> 23:28.676
- That's the thing.

23:28.759 --> 23:30.133
Nobody knows for sure.

23:30.216 --> 23:31.562
I mean, there's been a lot of theories,

23:31.645 --> 23:34.080
but the main theory, as broad as it seems,

23:34.163 --> 23:37.350
is that the secret seam is a
rip in the fabric of our universe

23:37.433 --> 23:40.098
that can only be seen
from a very specific location

23:40.181 --> 23:42.237
at a very specific angle.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.106
You have to be looking at it just right

23:44.189 --> 23:45.517
or else you'll miss it.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.671
That makes it incredibly hard to find

23:47.754 --> 23:50.525
and also why no one
knows if it actually exists.

23:50.608 --> 23:51.887
It's virtually invisible.

23:51.970 --> 23:54.264
- Okay, but why would it matter?

23:54.347 --> 23:58.081
Why would a virtually invisible
rip in the fabric of the universe

23:58.164 --> 23:59.002
make a difference?

23:59.085 --> 24:00.700
If it's been around since the dawn of time,

24:00.783 --> 24:02.769
which you seem to suggest,

24:02.852 --> 24:05.321
then what kind of problem is it imposing?

24:05.404 --> 24:06.403
- You're right.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.269
You're absolutely right.

24:07.352 --> 24:09.597
It's not really causing a problem, per se.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.268
It's the people that are after
it who are causing a problem.

24:12.351 --> 24:13.537
They're called the hunters.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.075
They can be anybody from the police

24:15.158 --> 24:16.559
to your neighbor next door.

24:16.642 --> 24:17.908
Hell, I could be one, too.

24:17.991 --> 24:19.091
They all believe

24:19.174 --> 24:22.357
that if you approach the seam,
something unbelievable will happen.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.306
- Like what?

24:23.389 --> 24:25.152
- Again, everyone has a different idea.

24:25.235 --> 24:27.280
Some think it's the fountain
of youth or immortality.

24:27.363 --> 24:29.185
Other people think it's
gonna transport them

24:29.268 --> 24:31.898
to an alternate dimension or universe.

24:31.981 --> 24:32.958
Some people think its, like...

24:33.041 --> 24:34.857
Time travel related, ya know?

24:34.940 --> 24:38.011
But everyone is essentially in agreement

24:38.094 --> 24:39.268
that it must be found,

24:39.351 --> 24:41.052
and they're willing to kill for it.

24:41.135 --> 24:43.401
I believe the hunters
killed your stepfather

24:43.484 --> 24:45.132
and kidnapped your mom, right?

24:45.215 --> 24:46.840
- I don't get it.

24:46.923 --> 24:49.533
They killed my stepfather for
it and they kidnapped my mom.

24:49.616 --> 24:51.609
All for something
that's virtually invisible.

24:51.692 --> 24:52.593
Why?

24:52.676 --> 24:53.742
Why work so hard

24:53.825 --> 24:56.585
for something that
you'll likely never find?

24:56.668 --> 24:57.721
- That Cypher?

24:57.804 --> 24:59.124
That trellis Cypher you have there?

24:59.207 --> 25:00.992
If I'm right about any of this,

25:01.075 --> 25:03.350
it's that that Cypher is a map,

25:03.433 --> 25:04.918
or at least part of a map.

25:05.001 --> 25:06.391
It's been long theorized

25:06.474 --> 25:08.675
that the information
on how to find the seam

25:08.758 --> 25:11.118
is too dangerous for one person.

25:11.201 --> 25:14.397
So, the key to finding
it was to split it apart.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.193
Voldemort style, you know?

25:16.276 --> 25:18.403
The trellis Cypher
traditionally has two parts.

25:18.486 --> 25:19.680
The Cypher itself

25:19.763 --> 25:21.709
and what's called a grille.

25:21.792 --> 25:24.600
A grille is basically
just a piece of cardboard

25:24.683 --> 25:25.548
with holes in it

25:25.631 --> 25:28.153
that tell you which of these
letters and numbers are important.

25:28.236 --> 25:30.582
That's a traditional Cypher.

25:30.665 --> 25:32.477
Like I said, on the backside of the trellis

25:32.560 --> 25:34.560
is a logo for the knights of Pythias.

25:34.643 --> 25:36.178
Like so many other secret societies,

25:36.261 --> 25:39.007
they're responsible for
keeping things a secret.

25:39.090 --> 25:40.295
Memorize this logo,

25:40.378 --> 25:41.970
I can almost guarantee that the grille

25:42.053 --> 25:43.958
and whatever else you need to decipher

25:44.041 --> 25:45.391
will have that same logo.

25:45.474 --> 25:47.008
- This is all too much.

25:47.091 --> 25:48.480
I don't even know where to start

25:48.563 --> 25:49.857
because I don't even have

25:49.940 --> 25:51.998
a grille, or whatever you said it was.

25:52.081 --> 25:54.553
- That's where I may be of some use.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.608
You guys ever hear of the men in black?

25:56.691 --> 25:59.984
- Here comes the 'men in black'...

26:00.067 --> 26:02.938
- Yeah, not the movie with will
Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.

26:03.021 --> 26:04.640
It's funny, don't get me wrong.

26:04.723 --> 26:06.400
It's just not an accurate representation

26:06.483 --> 26:08.624
of what the real men in black are based on.

26:08.707 --> 26:11.079
- I didn't know such a thing existed.

26:11.162 --> 26:12.446
- I mean, most people don't,

26:12.529 --> 26:13.492
but there's been sightings

26:13.575 --> 26:14.907
and other unexplained experiences

26:14.990 --> 26:17.028
dating back to forever ago,

26:17.111 --> 26:19.824
and like everything else,
nobody really knows what they are,

26:19.907 --> 26:22.321
but a lot of people
believe the men in black

26:22.404 --> 26:24.170
are actually aliens.

26:24.253 --> 26:26.995
- We're dealing with aliens now?

26:27.078 --> 26:30.198
- Actually, they may be
aliens, they may not be.

26:30.281 --> 26:31.838
It's not important, though.

26:31.921 --> 26:34.170
The real men in black
are specifically famous

26:34.253 --> 26:35.591
for their ability to keep a secret.

26:35.674 --> 26:37.792
That's the one aspect the movie got right.

26:37.875 --> 26:40.445
The 'secret seam' is one of
the biggest secrets ever told.

26:40.528 --> 26:43.346
I'm willing to bet that the
MIB either has the grille

26:43.429 --> 26:44.666
or they know where to find it.

26:44.749 --> 26:48.118
- Which means we have
to find the men in black.

26:48.201 --> 26:49.994
You wouldn't happen to have
their address, now would you?

26:50.077 --> 26:51.882
- No, but what I do have

26:51.965 --> 26:54.757
is a number of reading
materials for you to mull over.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.524
I'm sending them right now.

26:56.607 --> 26:58.424
It'll prove more useful to you, anyway.

26:58.507 --> 27:00.849
Though, I would focus on
the Maury island incident.

27:00.932 --> 27:02.923
- Wait, Maury island?

27:03.006 --> 27:04.267
I know that.

27:04.350 --> 27:05.445
Why do I know that?

27:05.528 --> 27:06.465
- Geez.

27:06.548 --> 27:10.337
Well, it's probably because
it's only 23 miles away.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.770
Maury island is here, in Washington.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.953
(Running footsteps)

27:25.324 --> 27:27.405
- Dude, what's goin' on?

27:27.488 --> 27:29.890
You're supposed to get
that book from the library

27:29.973 --> 27:31.214
an hour ago.

27:31.297 --> 27:32.610
Are you still there?

27:33.523 --> 27:35.046
- Yeah, hold on.

27:35.129 --> 27:37.710
I've been getting a lot of
weird looks left and right.

27:37.793 --> 27:39.484
There might be hunters here.

27:39.567 --> 27:40.258
Hold on.

27:43.713 --> 27:45.284
(Phone buzzing)

27:47.503 --> 27:49.089
- Yeah.

27:49.172 --> 27:50.614
No, I didn't lose him.

27:50.697 --> 27:52.353
He's around here somewhere.

27:52.436 --> 27:54.698
I'll find him.

27:57.363 --> 27:59.348
- Get out of there, then!

27:59.431 --> 28:01.846
- I will, hold on a second.

28:06.557 --> 28:07.846
(Door closing)

28:11.085 --> 28:14.378
Okay, so I found one of the
books Chuck was referring to.

28:14.461 --> 28:16.326
It's unfortunately just a
reference book, though.

28:16.409 --> 28:18.442
So, I can not check it out of the library.

28:18.525 --> 28:19.719
Listen to this.

28:20.519 --> 28:24.744
The Muary island incident
occurred in the summer of 1947

28:24.827 --> 28:26.100
where an independent aviator

28:26.183 --> 28:29.279
saw a group of what
can only be called UFOs.

28:29.362 --> 28:30.765
That's not that strange.

28:30.848 --> 28:32.563
But at the same exact time,

28:32.646 --> 28:34.975
a couple of boaters, a father-son

28:35.058 --> 28:36.385
and their dog

28:36.468 --> 28:38.463
also saw this group of UFOs.

28:38.546 --> 28:39.935
What's weird about it

28:40.018 --> 28:44.264
is that they also saw pieces
of metal falling from the UFOs,

28:44.347 --> 28:47.180
like a white-ish metal that fell from it.

28:47.263 --> 28:50.134
It hit one of the guys, breaking their arms

28:50.217 --> 28:52.806
and it also hit their
dog and it killed the dog,

28:52.889 --> 28:54.989
which is crazy!

28:55.072 --> 28:58.967
It's very unique for any kind
of UFO story that I've ever heard.

28:59.050 --> 29:03.801
So, obviously the FBI looked into it.

29:03.884 --> 29:06.221
They officially concluded
that it was a hoax,

29:06.304 --> 29:07.854
but ufologists around the world

29:07.937 --> 29:09.915
believe that that's a coverup.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.852
- Yeah, and so does Chuck.

29:11.935 --> 29:15.043
- Yes, but Chuck also
thinks everything's a cover-up.

29:15.126 --> 29:16.466
That's besides the point.

29:16.549 --> 29:18.446
One of these guys went around town

29:18.529 --> 29:20.510
telling everybody that would listen to him

29:20.593 --> 29:22.648
about what they saw, what they experienced,

29:22.731 --> 29:24.120
and the very next day,

29:24.203 --> 29:26.908
that is when he saw the man in black.

29:26.991 --> 29:29.568
So, the men in black
showed up at his front doorstep

29:29.651 --> 29:31.725
suggesting that they
eat breakfast together,

29:31.808 --> 29:33.382
and that's only where the weirdness began

29:33.465 --> 29:35.258
because the men in
black didn't ask this guy,

29:35.341 --> 29:39.943
his name is Harold Dahl,

29:40.026 --> 29:41.744
they didn't ask him anything.

29:41.827 --> 29:43.842
They simply just narrated

29:43.925 --> 29:45.799
everything that he saw

29:45.882 --> 29:47.176
to a t,

29:47.259 --> 29:49.348
and basically said that they mean business

29:49.431 --> 29:51.115
and if he goes around

29:51.198 --> 29:54.342
continuing to tell anybody else his story,

29:54.425 --> 29:57.046
then some very bad things
were going to happen to him.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.049
They threatened him.

29:58.132 --> 30:00.840
And so, obviously, he
stopped talking about it.

30:00.923 --> 30:03.228
He recanted his story,
he said he made it all up,

30:03.311 --> 30:05.528
and conspiracy theorists everywhere

30:05.611 --> 30:07.918
simply say of course he would.

30:08.001 --> 30:10.214
He's so terrified of the men in black

30:10.297 --> 30:13.085
that he had to pull his story.

30:13.168 --> 30:15.990
- So, that's the Maruy island incident?

30:16.073 --> 30:17.490
That's wild!

30:17.573 --> 30:18.189
- Well, yeah,

30:18.272 --> 30:20.432
but it still gets us no closer

30:20.515 --> 30:24.265
to finding out where to start with
finding an actual man in black.

30:24.348 --> 30:26.149
- Agreed, but if this guy

30:26.232 --> 30:28.076
really went around

30:28.159 --> 30:32.315
and was talking about UFOs
and aliens and caused this big stir

30:32.398 --> 30:34.090
for the men in black to step in,

30:34.173 --> 30:37.637
then I think that's
what we have to do, too.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.111
- All right, so what are you suggesting?

30:39.194 --> 30:40.977
- It's the 21st century, Jon.

30:41.060 --> 30:44.468
How does information spread like wildfire

30:44.551 --> 30:45.944
in today's day in age?

30:46.027 --> 30:49.414
We start on the world wide web.

30:49.497 --> 30:52.002
- Well, I mean your plan is
just as good as anybody's.

30:52.085 --> 30:53.449
So, let's do it.

30:53.532 --> 30:55.514
I'll see you in a little bit.

30:57.832 --> 31:00.909
(Phone ringing)

31:03.863 --> 31:05.067
Hello?

31:05.150 --> 31:08.979
(Heavy breathing)

31:09.062 --> 31:10.803
Hello?

31:10.886 --> 31:12.697
- [Graham] Hello, Jonathon.

31:12.780 --> 31:13.864
- [Jon] Who is this?

31:13.947 --> 31:15.651
- [Graham] Quit playing games, kid.

31:15.734 --> 31:18.362
We know that you know where the seam is.

31:18.445 --> 31:21.257
So, tell us, and we won't kill your mom.

31:21.340 --> 31:22.843
- [Mom] Jonathon!

31:22.926 --> 31:23.704
- [Jon] Mom!

31:23.787 --> 31:25.841
- [Graham] Tick, tock, kid.

31:25.924 --> 31:26.874
- [Jon] I don't know, I promise.

31:26.957 --> 31:28.638
This all happened so suddenly!

31:28.721 --> 31:31.815
- [Graham] You'll be
hearing from us very soon,

31:31.898 --> 31:33.903
and Jonathon...

31:33.986 --> 31:35.993
Read anything good lately?

31:38.542 --> 31:41.644
(Mouse scrolling)

31:47.790 --> 31:48.515
- Okay.

31:48.598 --> 31:51.978
So, I'm thinking the best way to
get people's attention in general

31:52.061 --> 31:54.079
is to go to an online forum like this,

31:54.162 --> 31:56.423
where you're allowed
to talk about anything.

31:56.506 --> 31:58.556
The nice thing about this forum is that

31:58.639 --> 32:00.108
you get to pick a U.S. state.

32:00.191 --> 32:01.967
So, for us, that's Washington.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.070
Now, I'm guessing all we have to do

32:04.153 --> 32:06.211
is say new thread

32:06.294 --> 32:07.287
and theoretically

32:07.370 --> 32:10.304
convince people that we saw aliens

32:10.387 --> 32:11.231
right?

32:11.314 --> 32:12.238
- Can't hurt.

32:12.321 --> 32:13.352
- Okay.

32:17.527 --> 32:19.170
So.

32:19.253 --> 32:22.415
I saw a UFO.

32:26.977 --> 32:31.785
I saw something crazy today.

32:31.868 --> 32:33.310
- [Flint] No. - [Jon] What?

32:33.393 --> 32:35.521
- You trying to sound like a tabloid?

32:35.604 --> 32:39.125
Move over, let the pros work their magic.

32:46.892 --> 32:50.264
(Typing)

32:52.430 --> 32:55.232
All right, let's try "UFO spotted

32:55.315 --> 32:59.364
at Maury island 70 years
after the initial incident".

32:59.692 --> 33:00.958
Good?

33:02.467 --> 33:04.321
We have to make it sound legit,

33:04.404 --> 33:08.114
otherwise the men in black
aren't gonna take it seriously.

33:08.197 --> 33:09.466
I have an idea.

33:10.537 --> 33:15.430
(Typing)

33:55.936 --> 33:58.351
Can you think of anything else to add?

33:58.434 --> 33:59.655
- No, not really.

34:03.993 --> 34:06.330
- [Flint] Well, now the hard part.

34:06.413 --> 34:08.402
Waiting for something to happen.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.870
(Thunder crashing)

34:16.389 --> 34:17.935
Hey, Jon!

34:18.018 --> 34:18.791
Wake up, man!

34:19.485 --> 34:20.437
- Wha?

34:20.520 --> 34:22.634
- [Flint] You need to see this!

34:30.165 --> 34:32.909
(Muffled rain pouring)

34:34.704 --> 34:35.868
Crap!

34:38.159 --> 34:40.177
Yo, this is too creepy for me.

34:40.260 --> 34:43.821
The guy's not even trying to
hide the fact that he's creepy.

34:44.297 --> 34:45.274
(Door pounding)

34:45.357 --> 34:46.868
Crap, crap, crap!

34:46.951 --> 34:48.288
(Door pounding)

34:48.371 --> 34:48.987
Oh my god!

34:49.070 --> 34:50.953
(Door pounding)

34:51.036 --> 34:52.712
What do we do?

34:52.795 --> 34:54.705
- I don't know, open the door!

35:05.463 --> 35:08.339
- [Flint] Can I help you?

35:08.422 --> 35:11.970
- The real question is can I help you?

35:12.053 --> 35:13.164
Yesterday evening,

35:13.247 --> 35:15.502
you started an untruthful thread post

35:15.585 --> 35:18.205
stating you witnessed an
unidentified flying object

35:18.288 --> 35:19.449
at Maury island.

35:19.532 --> 35:20.638
This was a lie.

35:20.721 --> 35:22.593
We want to know why.

35:22.676 --> 35:24.684
- What can you tell us
about the secret seam?

35:24.767 --> 35:27.118
We were told that you might know something.

35:27.201 --> 35:29.490
- Be careful what you wish for, Mr. Child.

35:29.573 --> 35:30.728
The secrets of what you seek

35:30.811 --> 35:32.779
aren't for the faint of heart.

35:37.371 --> 35:38.937
- [Flint] Where'd he go?

35:39.020 --> 35:40.585
- [Jon] Maybe he used a neuralyzer.

35:40.668 --> 35:42.087
- [Flint] Not funny.

35:42.170 --> 35:43.432
- You got a scanner?

35:43.515 --> 35:45.710
- [Flint] Not funny, Jonathon.

35:45.793 --> 35:46.937
Not funny.

35:54.887 --> 35:58.876
(Typing)

37:44.337 --> 37:45.132
- Holy crap, dude.

37:45.215 --> 37:46.784
That makes so much sense.

37:46.867 --> 37:48.499
- What does, the tomb of the unknown...

37:48.582 --> 37:50.491
- uh yeah, think about it.

37:50.574 --> 37:53.361
This place is guarded heavily 24/7

37:53.444 --> 37:56.326
for a tomb that doesn't house
any one specific soldier, ya know?

37:56.409 --> 37:58.355
It's more symbolic, really

37:58.438 --> 38:00.912
for soldiers that haven't been identified,

38:00.995 --> 38:03.125
but with that being said,

38:03.208 --> 38:04.658
why have guards for it, then?

38:04.741 --> 38:07.008
Vandals? Okay.

38:07.091 --> 38:09.852
They're definitely guarding something
more than just a symbolic idea,

38:09.935 --> 38:11.375
I'll tell you that much.

38:11.458 --> 38:12.392
- Huh.

38:12.475 --> 38:14.965
I guess I just never thought
about it that way before.

38:15.048 --> 38:17.248
- Jon, whatever you do, keep filming.

38:17.331 --> 38:18.937
You are so close to finding out what

38:19.020 --> 38:20.841
this secret seam might actually be.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.013
I'm rooting for you, man,

38:22.096 --> 38:23.821
but it also means you're gonna have

38:23.904 --> 38:25.460
an even bigger target painted on your back.

38:25.543 --> 38:27.028
I'm sure you knew.

38:27.111 --> 38:28.489
But

38:28.572 --> 38:31.776
the one thing you always
have to keep in mind

38:31.859 --> 38:33.384
is do not forget

38:33.467 --> 38:34.894
about those hunters.

38:34.977 --> 38:36.656
They're always gonna be there,

38:36.739 --> 38:38.388
and trust no one.

38:38.471 --> 38:39.921
- Well, I guess I'm buying

38:40.004 --> 38:41.692
a train ticket to Virginia.

38:41.775 --> 38:42.461
- Alrighty, man.

38:42.544 --> 38:43.755
Good luck.

38:44.693 --> 38:48.076
(Muffled train engine)

39:00.754 --> 39:05.017
(Laughing)

39:05.100 --> 39:06.336
- Where is he?

39:06.419 --> 39:09.725
Where... is... he!?

39:09.808 --> 39:13.535
You all had one fucking job!

39:13.618 --> 39:17.596
Find him and bring him to me now!

39:17.679 --> 39:18.457
Go get him!

39:18.540 --> 39:20.786
Go, go, go!

39:23.357 --> 39:26.210
(Train whistling)

39:35.065 --> 39:35.956
- [Flint] Hell yeah!

39:36.039 --> 39:37.065
Another one down.

39:37.148 --> 39:37.839
Come on,

39:37.922 --> 39:39.956
they seriously have
got to make this harder.

39:40.039 --> 39:41.706
(Phone ringing)

39:43.506 --> 39:44.675
Dude, what in the...

39:44.758 --> 39:45.966
Where are you?

39:46.049 --> 39:47.575
I thought you would have been

39:47.658 --> 39:49.885
halfway to Virginia by now.

39:51.437 --> 39:53.129
- There are hunters everywhere.

39:53.212 --> 39:55.030
I had to jump out of a train.

39:55.665 --> 39:57.319
- Woah, what!

39:58.789 --> 40:01.466
- It's almost like they have a
hive mind or something, because

40:01.549 --> 40:02.603
they are everywhere, man.

40:02.686 --> 40:04.745
They even have dogs.

40:04.828 --> 40:08.521
- Maybe find a cave or something
to hide in until they leave.

40:08.604 --> 40:09.538
- Maybe.

40:09.621 --> 40:10.584
God, I can’t do this.

40:10.667 --> 40:12.533
How am I supposed to make it to Virginia

40:12.616 --> 40:15.117
when I can barely only make it to Montana?

40:15.200 --> 40:17.092
- You're in Montana?

40:17.175 --> 40:19.010
- That's not the point, flint!

40:19.093 --> 40:21.185
- All right, just look
for somewhere to hide.

40:21.268 --> 40:22.346
- That's what I've been doing.

40:22.429 --> 40:24.050
Wait a second.

40:24.133 --> 40:25.325
- What is it?

40:25.408 --> 40:27.719
- You are not gonna believe this.

40:29.037 --> 40:30.238
Tell me you see him.

40:30.321 --> 40:31.347
- Oh, bizarre.

40:31.430 --> 40:34.258
Is that the same guy from before also?

40:34.341 --> 40:35.194
- I think so.

40:35.277 --> 40:36.634
Wait.

40:37.653 --> 40:38.961
Where'd he go?

40:39.044 --> 40:40.887
- Dude, follow him!

40:41.081 --> 40:44.069
(Leaves crunching)

40:50.181 --> 40:52.242
- [Jon] Uh, flint?

40:52.325 --> 40:53.602
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

40:53.685 --> 40:56.466
- This just keeps getting weirder.

40:56.549 --> 40:57.231
- [Jon] What do I do?

40:57.314 --> 41:00.417
- Well, when life gives you lemons...

41:01.532 --> 41:03.441
- [Jon] You make lemonade.

41:06.721 --> 41:07.873
(Sighs) Come on.

41:13.344 --> 41:15.023
Where is this place?

41:15.106 --> 41:16.813
- [Agent] That's not important.

41:16.896 --> 41:18.957
- [Jon] Kind of is.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.339
- What are you doing?

41:21.422 --> 41:22.400
- [Jon] I...

41:22.483 --> 41:25.161
- you were advised not
to continue on this path.

41:25.244 --> 41:26.973
- [Jon] I know, I...

41:27.056 --> 41:28.201
- and you decided

41:28.284 --> 41:29.517
to ignore us.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.036
- [Jon] Yeah.

41:31.119 --> 41:32.444
- [Agent] This will be our final attempt

41:32.527 --> 41:34.489
to request to stop this undertaking

41:34.572 --> 41:35.844
and go back home.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.024
- [Jon] Or what?

41:37.107 --> 41:40.318
All right, well I can't stop.

41:40.401 --> 41:42.461
This is the only way that
I can save my mother.

41:42.544 --> 41:43.971
The only way.

41:44.054 --> 41:44.957
- Very well.

41:45.040 --> 41:47.814
(Wood slamming) (Gasping)

41:47.897 --> 41:50.579
This will take you to
wherever you ask of it.

41:50.662 --> 41:52.976
While you should be
asking it to take you home,

41:53.059 --> 41:56.006
I will not stop you from
asking it anything else.

41:56.089 --> 41:58.438
That is a choice I leave to you.

41:59.589 --> 42:02.628
- [Jon] Another vanishing act, god.

42:02.711 --> 42:04.499
Wherever I ask of it.

42:05.604 --> 42:06.861
(Exhaling)

42:06.944 --> 42:08.348
All right.

42:08.431 --> 42:11.959
The tomb of the unknown soldier.

42:14.421 --> 42:17.174
(Chuckling) No way.

42:17.257 --> 42:21.238
They are never gonna believe this.

42:26.194 --> 42:28.685
(Ringing)

42:28.768 --> 42:29.380
- Jon, hey.

42:29.463 --> 42:31.068
What happened after the door?

42:31.151 --> 42:32.452
- What door?

42:32.535 --> 42:33.673
Hey, Jonathon.

42:33.756 --> 42:36.074
- Sorry, no time, but I do have news.

42:37.443 --> 42:38.858
- How on earth did you get there so fast?

42:38.941 --> 42:41.403
I have to know where that door leads to.

42:41.486 --> 42:43.278
- Okay, can someone tell me what door?

42:43.361 --> 42:44.579
I'm lost!

42:45.043 --> 42:47.833
- So, I have absolutely no idea
how I'm gonna get past these guys.

42:47.916 --> 42:49.168
They never leave.

42:49.251 --> 42:50.563
- I mean, are you really surprised?

42:50.646 --> 42:52.096
If you cross those chains and rails,

42:52.179 --> 42:53.013
they're gonna yell at you,

42:53.096 --> 42:54.511
threaten you with their bayonets.

42:54.594 --> 42:56.917
I mean, they take their job very seriously.

42:57.000 --> 42:57.959
They're good at it.

42:58.042 --> 43:00.712
- But why? It's just a cemetery, isn't it?

43:00.795 --> 43:03.379
- Honestly, that's the
million-dollar question, ain't it?

43:03.462 --> 43:04.930
I mean, if you were asking me,

43:05.013 --> 43:07.245
I'd create a diversion
and then just go for it.

43:07.328 --> 43:08.937
- Okay, and then what?

43:09.020 --> 43:11.060
- Look, if we're right
about this being something

43:11.143 --> 43:13.005
much more than it claims to be,

43:13.088 --> 43:16.060
then I guarantee you these soldiers
can't even follow you into the tomb.

43:16.143 --> 43:17.124
You'll have to get in,

43:17.207 --> 43:18.659
look around for what you want

43:18.742 --> 43:19.942
and do it quick enough

43:20.025 --> 43:21.775
before those soldiers call their superiors,

43:21.858 --> 43:24.298
cause you're gonna be dragged
to federal prison if they get ya.

43:24.381 --> 43:25.584
- I'm sorry, what?

43:25.667 --> 43:26.480
- What do you expect?

43:26.563 --> 43:27.584
They'll shoot you in front of a crowd.

43:27.667 --> 43:29.766
They do not care, trust me,

43:29.849 --> 43:31.672
and once you get into that tomb,

43:31.755 --> 43:34.909
you're gonna be in some pretty big trouble.

43:34.992 --> 43:36.752
(Running)

43:36.835 --> 43:40.050
- [Guard] Remain behind
the chains and rails!

43:40.133 --> 43:41.874
(Heavy stone moving)

43:44.822 --> 43:45.435
(Slamming)

43:45.518 --> 43:48.048
- [Jon] Okay, there doesn't seem to
be any cell reception inside the tomb.

43:48.131 --> 43:48.934
I tried calling the guys to no avail,

43:49.017 --> 43:52.144
but bad news.

43:52.227 --> 43:53.507
There's nothing here.

43:53.590 --> 43:56.040
There's no secret seam, there's no body.

43:56.123 --> 43:58.593
I mean, that second
part's not all that a surprise,

43:58.676 --> 44:00.359
given the fact that Chuck did say that this

44:00.442 --> 44:03.357
was more of a symbolic
thing than an actual tomb,

44:03.440 --> 44:05.232
but it is quiet in here.

44:05.821 --> 44:09.503
I don't know if they lined this
place with lead to kill cell reception

44:09.586 --> 44:11.828
or they lined the place with soundproofing

44:11.911 --> 44:13.891
or what, but

44:13.974 --> 44:15.693
I get the weirdest feeling

44:15.776 --> 44:18.974
that I'm cut off from
the rest of the world.

44:19.477 --> 44:20.733
Now, they did say

44:20.816 --> 44:23.654
that this secret seam
thing is supposed to be

44:23.737 --> 44:26.472
near impossible to spot, so...

44:26.555 --> 44:28.621
I mean, I guess I
should start investigating.

44:28.704 --> 44:29.522
Might as well, right?

44:29.605 --> 44:31.070
Because I'm about to get arrested

44:31.153 --> 44:32.909
for breaking into a national monument.

44:32.992 --> 44:34.124
So, there is that.

44:34.910 --> 44:36.317
God, I'm such an idiot.

44:37.384 --> 44:38.730
There's nothing here.

44:40.006 --> 44:43.101
(Heaving breathing)

44:56.833 --> 44:58.899
I feel so stupid.

44:58.982 --> 45:01.690
That guy from the men in black was right.

45:01.773 --> 45:02.847
He warned me time and time again

45:02.930 --> 45:06.534
not to do this, but I felt as if I had to.

45:06.617 --> 45:10.101
Yeah, yeah, I knew better than
the interdimentional teleporting alien.

45:10.184 --> 45:11.608
Stupid.

45:22.907 --> 45:24.464
No way.

45:27.196 --> 45:29.698
This is impossible.

45:29.781 --> 45:30.855
It's real!

45:34.896 --> 45:36.440
See you on the other side.

45:39.203 --> 45:40.622
(Heavy stones moving)

45:58.461 --> 45:59.864
- [Flint] No way.

46:04.081 --> 46:05.169
No way!

46:06.002 --> 46:07.683
(Mouse scrolling)

46:08.299 --> 46:11.970
(Mumbling)

46:12.053 --> 46:13.867
Ran for the tomb?

46:14.478 --> 46:16.519
(Mumbling)

46:18.648 --> 46:20.210
Hidden entrance.

46:20.874 --> 46:23.304
(Mumbling)

46:24.801 --> 46:26.615
Unable to find him?

46:26.698 --> 46:27.971
Holy shit!

46:36.949 --> 46:38.865
- Hey, flint.

46:38.948 --> 46:42.020
- Hey, so did you read the paper?

46:42.103 --> 46:44.852
- Not yet, I'm sorry,
I'm about to go on air.

46:44.935 --> 46:45.951
What's goin' on?

46:46.034 --> 46:47.913
- It looks like Jonathon was able to do it.

46:47.996 --> 46:49.815
The newspaper shows a picture of him

46:49.898 --> 46:52.697
saying that he broke in, but
when they went in to get him,

46:52.780 --> 46:55.169
poof, not there.

46:55.252 --> 46:56.432
- Oh, wow.

46:56.515 --> 46:57.784
I mean I was rooting for him.

46:57.867 --> 47:00.210
I just didn't think he'd actually do it.

47:00.293 --> 47:03.908
- Yeah, which poses the question

47:03.991 --> 47:05.781
where the hell did he go?

47:05.864 --> 47:07.354
- Well, I mean

47:07.437 --> 47:10.111
I haven't been contacted by him.

47:10.194 --> 47:11.220
- Me, either,

47:11.303 --> 47:13.293
but tell me again

47:13.376 --> 47:15.743
what happens when you touch the seam?

47:15.826 --> 47:18.808
- Yeah, and that's the
million-dollar question.

47:18.891 --> 47:21.597
I mean, everyone seems
to have a different idea on it,

47:21.680 --> 47:24.985
but their ideas range from teleportation,

47:25.068 --> 47:26.379
time travel,

47:26.462 --> 47:28.559
and even disintegration.

47:28.642 --> 47:29.840
- Disentigration?

47:29.923 --> 47:32.308
You mean like... Dead?

47:32.391 --> 47:34.382
- Yeah, I wouldn't read too deep into it.

47:34.465 --> 47:35.639
I mean, a lot of these theories

47:35.722 --> 47:36.995
are just from freaks and geeks

47:37.078 --> 47:38.641
that live in their parents basement

47:38.724 --> 47:40.875
or watch too many episodes
of "the twilight zone".

47:40.958 --> 47:43.502
I mean, none of it has any real proof,

47:43.585 --> 47:45.280
and as far as I'm aware,

47:45.363 --> 47:47.101
no one's ever gotten this far before.

47:47.184 --> 47:48.635
- We're in the dark.

47:48.718 --> 47:50.260
- Yeah, but one thing's for certain.

47:50.343 --> 47:51.699
No matter what,

47:51.782 --> 47:53.613
this ain't over.

47:55.303 --> 47:57.266
Yeah, sorry, I gotta go.

47:57.349 --> 47:58.534
Richard's giving me a look.

47:58.617 --> 47:59.444
- All right.

47:59.527 --> 48:00.880
Break a leg!

48:12.745 --> 48:13.667
Jon?

48:13.750 --> 48:15.928
Oh man, you made it!

48:16.011 --> 48:18.328
Chuck and I have been really worried.

48:18.411 --> 48:20.509
Where the hell have you been?

48:21.782 --> 48:23.140
- Yeah, sorry.

48:23.223 --> 48:26.232
I was at the hospital here.

48:26.315 --> 48:29.243
They had me under a temporary coma.

48:29.326 --> 48:30.911
- You okay?

48:33.003 --> 48:33.959
- I'm fine.

48:34.042 --> 48:35.435
They actually had me

48:35.518 --> 48:37.748
under a John Smith alias

48:37.831 --> 48:40.836
because they couldn't
find identification on me.

48:40.919 --> 48:41.998
- Oh wow.

48:42.081 --> 48:43.702
Why not?

48:43.785 --> 48:44.839
(Chuckling)

48:44.922 --> 48:45.895
- Well, I'm pretty sure

48:45.978 --> 48:47.527
you'll get a kick out of this, but

48:47.610 --> 48:50.256
I was found completely naked in a field.

48:50.339 --> 48:53.197
(Laughing)

48:53.280 --> 48:54.378
- Oh, I'm sorry.

48:54.461 --> 48:55.994
Probably embarrassing.

48:56.077 --> 48:57.033
- It's all good.

48:57.116 --> 49:00.034
Not like I actually remember any of it.

49:00.117 --> 49:03.082
- So, what's the last
thing you do remember?

49:03.165 --> 49:04.416
- Um.

49:04.499 --> 49:06.975
I remember getting into the tomb.

49:07.058 --> 49:09.026
I remember looking at the seam,

49:09.109 --> 49:11.121
and I feel like I walked into it,

49:11.204 --> 49:13.770
but after that, it's a blur,

49:13.853 --> 49:15.228
I don't really remember any of it.

49:15.311 --> 49:18.502
- So, you have amnesia?

49:18.585 --> 49:20.132
- I guess, yeah.

49:20.215 --> 49:22.015
- Did they give you a clean bill of health?

49:22.098 --> 49:22.898
- Yeah, yeah.

49:22.981 --> 49:25.846
They said medically, they
had no reason to hold me.

49:25.929 --> 49:27.756
They gave me a coupon for this place

49:27.839 --> 49:29.802
and the rest is history.

49:29.885 --> 49:32.453
- Yeah, well if hunters weren't bad enough,

49:32.536 --> 49:36.299
you're basically now on
"America’s most wanted"

49:36.382 --> 49:39.093
for breaking into a historic monument

49:39.176 --> 49:40.791
that's been around for nearly a century.

49:40.874 --> 49:42.368
Not to mention

49:42.451 --> 49:46.441
you're still wanted for the
double-homicide of your folks.

49:46.524 --> 49:49.170
- Don't remind me.

49:49.253 --> 49:52.301
- The only thing you actually
have going for you right now

49:52.384 --> 49:56.091
is the fact that people don't expect
you to be halfway on the other side

49:56.174 --> 49:57.778
of the country right now,

49:57.861 --> 49:59.411
but time's running out, man.

49:59.494 --> 50:01.467
Pretty soon, you're gonna have your face

50:01.550 --> 50:02.742
all over national news

50:02.825 --> 50:04.021
where you're not gonna be able to hide

50:04.104 --> 50:05.492
in a comfy hotel.

50:05.575 --> 50:07.863
I kinda hate to rush you,

50:07.946 --> 50:11.344
but we need a plan of action.

50:11.427 --> 50:12.085
- Yeah, yeah.

50:12.168 --> 50:13.734
I'm sorry, flint.

50:13.817 --> 50:14.941
I'm just really tired.

50:15.024 --> 50:16.504
I need to get to sleep.

50:16.587 --> 50:19.791
We'll figure out the next
step in the morning, yeah?

50:19.874 --> 50:20.758
- You're right.

50:20.841 --> 50:22.158
You need your beauty rest.

50:22.241 --> 50:23.739
Sleep tight Princess.

50:23.822 --> 50:27.168
And don't forget to call
me as soon as you're able.

50:34.163 --> 50:34.862
- Okay.

50:34.945 --> 50:37.269
Alright, so status update.

50:37.352 --> 50:39.018
I'm feeling.

50:39.101 --> 50:41.099
Man, I gotta call flint!

50:49.282 --> 50:50.570
- Jon?

50:50.653 --> 50:52.557
Is everything okay?

50:52.640 --> 50:55.141
It's like 2 A.M.

50:55.224 --> 50:58.076
- Oh, I'm feeling more than okay, man!

50:58.159 --> 50:59.448
I mean, last night,

50:59.531 --> 51:01.444
I was not feeling all that great, granted,

51:01.527 --> 51:04.297
but this morning, when I woke up.

51:04.380 --> 51:05.064
Whoo!

51:05.147 --> 51:06.902
I mean, I feel like a new man.

51:06.985 --> 51:08.744
- Okay?

51:08.827 --> 51:10.331
- I feel like I could run a marathon.

51:10.414 --> 51:12.549
You know, I feel like
whatever was in the seam

51:12.632 --> 51:16.209
gave me all this energy,
but what does it all mean?

51:16.292 --> 51:19.930
- It means I need to go back to sleep.

51:20.013 --> 51:22.379
Goodnight, Jo...

51:22.462 --> 51:23.712
Jon?

51:30.964 --> 51:32.606
Where's the weights come from?

51:32.689 --> 51:33.510
- I bought it!

51:38.281 --> 51:39.058
Whoo!

51:39.141 --> 51:41.044
Never felt more energized in my life.

51:41.127 --> 51:42.320
This is crazy!

51:42.403 --> 51:44.437
Okay, can I go back to bed now?

51:44.520 --> 51:46.269
- Fine, as soon as you...

51:46.352 --> 51:48.503
Bless you... As soon as you can, call me

51:48.586 --> 51:50.437
(sneezes)

51:50.520 --> 51:51.650
- Wait. - What's up?

51:51.733 --> 51:54.352
- How'd you know I was gonna sneeze?

51:54.435 --> 51:55.424
- Oh, I don't know.

51:55.507 --> 51:56.462
It just seemed like the right thing to say

51:56.545 --> 51:57.690
at the moment.

51:57.773 --> 51:59.267
- Power of suggestion

51:59.350 --> 52:00.469
I guess.

52:00.552 --> 52:01.746
(Snapping)

52:01.829 --> 52:03.947
- Anyways, I'll let you get back to it.

52:04.030 --> 52:07.318
I know it's in the middle of
the night and everything, but

52:07.401 --> 52:09.013
are you gonna get that?

52:09.096 --> 52:12.096
- Get what? (Phone ringing)

52:18.129 --> 52:21.226
(Ringtone)

52:22.016 --> 52:23.288
- [Chuck] Hello?

52:23.371 --> 52:25.116
I don't know what's
going on with this video.

52:25.199 --> 52:27.178
Jonathon, you're back?

52:27.261 --> 52:28.898
- You can say that again.

52:28.981 --> 52:30.771
- Yeah, I'm back and I'm better than ever.

52:30.854 --> 52:32.177
Ask me something.

52:32.260 --> 52:34.153
- [Chuck] Um... What?

52:34.236 --> 52:35.543
- Ask me something!

52:35.626 --> 52:37.124
- [Chuck] Dude, just spit it
out, I don't have time for this.

52:37.207 --> 52:39.882
- Let's not get too ahead of ourselves,

52:39.965 --> 52:42.155
we don't know exactly what the seam did,

52:42.238 --> 52:44.212
but it definitely changed Jon.

52:44.295 --> 52:45.661
- [Chuck] How?

52:45.744 --> 52:48.014
- Well for one... - I can see the future!

52:48.097 --> 52:50.223
- Okay, so, not exactly the future, per se,

52:50.306 --> 52:51.363
but little things.

52:51.446 --> 52:52.994
So, pick a number, for instance.

52:53.077 --> 52:54.796
- [Chuck] Okay...

52:54.879 --> 52:55.565
- Seven?

52:55.648 --> 52:56.314
Come on man,

52:56.397 --> 52:57.381
get a little more original...

52:57.464 --> 52:59.736
10,677

52:59.819 --> 53:01.037
now we're talking.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.059
- [Chuck] All right, hol...

53:02.142 --> 53:03.098
There's no...

53:03.181 --> 53:05.434
Precognition?

53:05.517 --> 53:06.644
- Yes

53:06.727 --> 53:09.487
and no, that's what's so weird

53:09.570 --> 53:10.800
about the whole thing.

53:10.883 --> 53:12.251
He doesn't know everything.

53:12.334 --> 53:14.251
He just knows some things

53:14.334 --> 53:15.674
some times.

53:15.757 --> 53:17.753
- [Chuck] I mean, this is
weird, but that makes sense.

53:17.836 --> 53:20.166
That's one thing any
modern science fiction film

53:20.249 --> 53:22.140
would naturally get wrong:

53:22.223 --> 53:25.372
Definiting what kind of
limitations there are if and when

53:25.455 --> 53:26.682
you get extra abilities.

53:26.765 --> 53:28.721
Instead, you'll have a
superhero that has a weakness.

53:28.804 --> 53:31.312
Superman has kryptonite,
for instance, but without it,

53:31.395 --> 53:34.522
are we ever really told how
far his laser vision reaches?

53:34.605 --> 53:36.264
It has to stop somewhere, right?

53:36.347 --> 53:38.704
It doesn't just keep
going and going forever.

53:38.787 --> 53:39.812
This is wild.

53:39.895 --> 53:41.507
I mean, I'm starting to sound crazy.

53:41.590 --> 53:43.551
- Hard to wrap your head around, right?

53:43.634 --> 53:46.242
I'm still trying to... - Ask me something!

53:46.325 --> 53:49.377
- [Chuck] I don't even know where to begin.

53:49.460 --> 53:50.574
- Come on, man.

53:50.657 --> 53:52.253
You have all these random trivia facts

53:52.336 --> 53:54.722
just floating around in your head
when you do that show of yours.

53:54.805 --> 53:56.362
So, I need you to have them right now

53:56.445 --> 53:57.713
and test me. (Sighs)

53:57.796 --> 53:58.773
- [Chuck] Okay, okay.

53:58.856 --> 54:01.701
Before it was a hashtag or
a pound key on the phone,

54:01.784 --> 54:03.966
what was that symbol called?

54:04.049 --> 54:05.230
- Octothorpe, next.

54:05.313 --> 54:06.845
- [Chuck] Um...

54:06.928 --> 54:09.075
What's the national animal of Scotland?

54:09.158 --> 54:11.503
- (Chuckling) A unicorn - what!

54:11.586 --> 54:12.493
- [Chuck] It's true.

54:12.576 --> 54:14.278
Did you already know
that, though, Jonathon?

54:14.361 --> 54:15.496
- Not even a little bit.

54:15.579 --> 54:16.361
Keep going.

54:16.444 --> 54:17.523
- [Chuck] In 5-card poker,

54:17.606 --> 54:19.903
what are the odds of getting a royal flush?

54:19.986 --> 54:22.705
- One in 649,740.

54:22.788 --> 54:25.161
- [Chuck] I mean, I don't remember

54:25.244 --> 54:27.091
the exact number right off the bat,

54:27.174 --> 54:28.831
but that does sound right.

54:28.914 --> 54:30.636
Okay, let me ask you something.

54:30.719 --> 54:31.955
What does it feel like?

54:32.038 --> 54:33.632
- The best way that I
can try to describe it

54:33.715 --> 54:35.621
is that it doesn't feel like knowledge.

54:35.704 --> 54:37.665
Instead, it feels a lot
like more like intuition.

54:37.748 --> 54:40.441
It feels like it's just
the right thing to say,

54:40.524 --> 54:42.737
and as it turns out, it often is.

54:42.820 --> 54:43.997
- [Chuck] Damn.

54:44.080 --> 54:46.899
I mean, but you guys he
doesn't get everything right?

54:46.982 --> 54:48.779
- Right, exactly.

54:48.862 --> 54:49.710
So, what I've found

54:49.793 --> 54:51.383
is the bigger the question,

54:51.466 --> 54:53.173
the more unsure I feel

54:53.256 --> 54:54.277
when I answer.

54:54.360 --> 54:57.296
- Yeah, and the theory
is the bigger the question,

54:57.379 --> 54:59.665
the more possibility
that that could change,

54:59.748 --> 55:01.078
but for example, if you were to ask him

55:01.161 --> 55:04.565
about the mathematical odds of a card game

55:04.648 --> 55:06.051
or a national animal.

55:06.134 --> 55:09.833
Yeah, that's unchanging data, facts,

55:09.916 --> 55:11.753
but if you ask him when I was gonna die,

55:11.836 --> 55:13.382
he has no idea!

55:13.465 --> 55:14.928
I could die in 50 years time,

55:15.011 --> 55:17.019
I could die right now.

55:17.102 --> 55:19.852
It depends on a number
of different factors,

55:19.935 --> 55:21.936
but earlier, he actually predicted

55:22.019 --> 55:22.910
I was gonna sneeze,

55:22.993 --> 55:24.942
but I mean

55:25.025 --> 55:27.031
there was a lot of different signs

55:27.114 --> 55:30.651
and he may have taken notice of that.

55:30.734 --> 55:31.920
- [Chuck] Incredible.

55:35.130 --> 55:38.064
(Ringtone)

55:41.202 --> 55:43.281
(Screaming)

55:43.364 --> 55:44.375
- Mom!

55:44.458 --> 55:45.995
- Hello, Jonathon.

55:46.078 --> 55:48.546
I told you we'd be speaking
again soon, didn't I?

55:48.629 --> 55:50.921
Looks like we've been a busy bee lately.

55:51.004 --> 55:52.609
Getting into a wee bit of trouble?

55:52.692 --> 55:53.494
- What do you want?

55:53.577 --> 55:54.734
- Hmm.

55:54.817 --> 55:57.128
Yeah, I'll make it easy for ya.

55:57.211 --> 55:59.127
How about we propose a trade?

55:59.210 --> 56:00.632
You give me what I want,

56:00.715 --> 56:02.361
and I'll give you your mother.

56:03.559 --> 56:06.171
- The seam is at the tomb of the...

56:06.254 --> 56:07.258
(laughing)

56:07.341 --> 56:09.363
- I know where the seam is, child.

56:09.446 --> 56:10.626
Do no pretend

56:10.709 --> 56:13.255
to think you can fool me.
- I don't...

56:13.338 --> 56:14.694
- you don't know what you're dealing with.

56:14.777 --> 56:16.688
You will not stand in
the way of my resolve,

56:16.771 --> 56:18.172
Mr. Child!

56:19.796 --> 56:21.232
- What do I do?

56:21.315 --> 56:22.490
- That's better.

56:24.695 --> 56:26.207
I'm looking for exodus.

56:26.290 --> 56:27.464
You get me that,

56:27.547 --> 56:30.112
and I promise no harm
will come to your mother.

56:32.197 --> 56:33.993
You have 24 hours.

56:38.941 --> 56:40.359
(Ringtone)

56:45.345 --> 56:47.707
- Okay, now what happened?

56:47.790 --> 56:49.173
- The guy that kidnapped my mom,

56:49.256 --> 56:50.499
Graham Seether, said that if we don't

56:50.582 --> 56:53.407
figure out where exodus is in 24 hours,

56:53.490 --> 56:54.821
he'll kill her.

56:54.904 --> 56:56.808
- Did he even tell you what exodus

56:56.891 --> 56:59.013
was supposed to be?

56:59.096 --> 57:00.467
- No, and I couldn't even ask,

57:00.550 --> 57:02.202
because he's clearly deranged.

57:02.285 --> 57:05.444
So, I was hoping that
you'd be able to help me out.

57:05.527 --> 57:09.130
- What does your intuition thing tell you?

57:09.213 --> 57:10.561
- Honestly, not much.

57:10.644 --> 57:12.213
I don't even have much to go off of

57:12.296 --> 57:13.840
other than the general idea

57:13.923 --> 57:16.663
that exodus is code for something.

57:16.746 --> 57:18.683
- Yeah, that doesn't help much.

57:18.766 --> 57:21.164
- Not at all, so can you help me out here?

57:21.247 --> 57:23.008
Because I don't even have a computer.

57:23.091 --> 57:24.572
- Yeah.

57:24.655 --> 57:26.094
Hold on.

57:32.564 --> 57:35.717
(Typing)

57:41.540 --> 57:46.075
Okay, exodus is defined as
a mass departure of people,

57:46.158 --> 57:47.719
especially emigrants.

57:47.802 --> 57:51.654
Some synonyms of this is
evacuation, withdrawal, leaving,

57:51.737 --> 57:53.534
exit and migration.

57:53.617 --> 57:56.096
- [Jon] I figured most of that already.

57:56.179 --> 57:56.891
- Sorry, man.

57:56.974 --> 57:58.856
I don't know what else to do.

57:58.939 --> 57:59.745
- Wait.

57:59.828 --> 58:01.349
We've been going about this the wrong way.

58:01.432 --> 58:02.729
Instead of trying to use my intuition

58:02.812 --> 58:05.862
to try to figure out what exodus
is referring to, or where it is,

58:05.945 --> 58:08.468
I should just be trying to
figure out where my mother is.

58:08.551 --> 58:09.873
Screw exodus!

58:14.000 --> 58:14.815
Flint.

58:14.898 --> 58:15.986
- No way.

58:16.069 --> 58:19.360
You know where she is, don't you?

58:19.443 --> 58:20.965
- And you're not gonna like it.

58:21.048 --> 58:23.523
- What now?

58:23.606 --> 58:24.877
- She's on Maury island.

58:24.960 --> 58:26.696
- You're kiddin' right?

58:26.779 --> 58:28.557
- No, it's some kind of...

58:28.640 --> 58:30.051
I think it's a lighthouse.

58:30.134 --> 58:32.009
- Okay.

58:32.092 --> 58:33.770
- Flint, I can't get to her.

58:33.853 --> 58:34.771
Not in 24 hours.

58:34.854 --> 58:36.539
Not even if I jump in a car right now

58:36.622 --> 58:39.985
and speed all the way to Seattle.

58:40.068 --> 58:41.373
- Oh.

58:41.456 --> 58:42.637
Right.

58:42.720 --> 58:43.968
- Which means...

58:44.051 --> 58:46.039
- Jon, no!

58:46.122 --> 58:47.310
- You're up.

58:50.133 --> 58:51.815
Hey, can you share
your screen for a second?

58:51.898 --> 58:54.029
- I don't know, hold on a minute.

58:58.721 --> 59:00.444
Did that work?

59:00.527 --> 59:01.303
- Yeah, it's just

59:01.386 --> 59:02.468
it's a little bit small on my end.

59:02.551 --> 59:03.813
So, you'll have to work with me

59:03.896 --> 59:05.349
and try to explain what you're seeing.

59:05.432 --> 59:06.061
- I don't know, man.

59:06.144 --> 59:09.022
It just looks like a blueprint.

59:10.504 --> 59:11.899
For me, it looks like

59:11.982 --> 59:15.862
a crosswire section of a lighthouse.

59:15.945 --> 59:18.207
I don't know exactly what
I'm supposed to be looking for.

59:18.290 --> 59:19.429
- Okay, hold on.

59:23.721 --> 59:24.384
All right.

59:24.467 --> 59:26.367
Do you see any ladders on your end?

59:26.450 --> 59:28.189
- [Flint] Yeah, I see stairs going up

59:28.272 --> 59:30.921
and ladders going down, why?

59:31.004 --> 59:32.476
- Because that's our answer.

59:32.559 --> 59:34.302
Where does the ladder lead?

59:34.385 --> 59:37.720
- [Flint] Looks like an
underground room of some sort.

59:37.803 --> 59:39.990
Basement, maybe?

59:40.073 --> 59:42.797
- Maybe, but whatever it is,

59:42.880 --> 59:45.426
my mother's being held in that room.

59:45.509 --> 59:47.229
- Are you sure?

59:47.312 --> 59:48.472
- Yeah, I'm sure,

59:48.555 --> 59:50.709
and right now, I think that there’s only

59:50.792 --> 59:52.490
two men keeping an eye on her,

59:52.573 --> 59:55.247
but that might change from now until then.

59:55.330 --> 59:56.435
- Two men.

59:56.518 --> 59:57.343
Okay.

59:57.426 --> 59:59.874
Where can I expect them to be?

59:59.957 --> 1:00:01.291
- I don't know.

1:00:01.374 --> 1:00:02.459
- [Flint] Oh.

1:00:02.542 --> 1:00:03.355
- Yet.

1:00:03.438 --> 1:00:04.681
I don't know yet.

1:00:04.764 --> 1:00:06.762
You're gonna have to call me
when you get to the lighthouse.

1:00:06.845 --> 1:00:09.084
- I won't be able to hold up a phone

1:00:09.167 --> 1:00:11.818
and film everything, you know?

1:00:11.901 --> 1:00:12.648
- I know.

1:00:12.731 --> 1:00:14.280
Just call me the old fashioned way.

1:00:14.363 --> 1:00:15.362
I'll walk you though the steps

1:00:15.445 --> 1:00:16.962
as they come to me.

1:00:17.045 --> 1:00:20.298
- I can't believe this is your master plan.

1:00:20.381 --> 1:00:21.712
Winging it!

1:00:21.795 --> 1:00:23.444
- I have no other option, flint.

1:00:23.527 --> 1:00:24.389
- I know.

1:00:24.472 --> 1:00:25.754
I get it.

1:00:25.837 --> 1:00:27.471
When are we doing this?

1:00:27.554 --> 1:00:29.077
- Shouldn't I be asking you that?

1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:30.867
- Fine, I'll do it tonight.

1:00:30.950 --> 1:00:32.999
Not like I've got anything else going on.

1:00:33.082 --> 1:00:34.277
- I appreciate you.

1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:36.386
- You better.
You know if I get killed,

1:00:36.469 --> 1:00:38.741
I'm gonna come back and haunt you.

1:00:38.824 --> 1:00:41.039
- I expect nothing less.

1:00:45.335 --> 1:00:46.171
- [Jon] Hello?

1:00:46.254 --> 1:00:47.186
- [Flint] I'm here.

1:00:47.269 --> 1:00:48.161
- [Jon] Okay.

1:00:48.244 --> 1:00:50.168
I have the feeling like
there's a third bogey

1:00:50.251 --> 1:00:51.823
that's you're gonna have to deal with.

1:00:51.906 --> 1:00:52.619
- [Flint] Fun!

1:00:52.702 --> 1:00:54.683
Well, I've got my dad's gun.

1:00:54.766 --> 1:00:58.000
How are we doing this, Morpheus?
- [Jon] Very funny.

1:00:58.083 --> 1:01:00.393
Well honestly, there's no
need to be stealthy at all.

1:01:00.476 --> 1:01:02.520
They'll probably be expecting you.

1:01:02.603 --> 1:01:04.154
- [Flint] Okay.

1:01:04.237 --> 1:01:05.041
- [Jon] Don't worry about it.

1:01:05.124 --> 1:01:05.891
It'll be fine.

1:01:05.974 --> 1:01:08.851
Just go through the front door
with your gun aimed to the right.

1:01:08.934 --> 1:01:10.300
- [Flint] Why the right?

1:01:10.383 --> 1:01:11.943
- [Jon] 'Cause that's where
you're gonna be firing.

1:01:12.026 --> 1:01:13.717
- [Flint] All right.

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:15.365
Let's get this over with.

1:01:15.700 --> 1:01:17.787
(Footsteps running)

1:01:17.870 --> 1:01:19.094
(Gun cocking)

1:01:19.177 --> 1:01:19.995
(Guns firing)

1:01:20.078 --> 1:01:21.505
(Screaming)

1:01:21.588 --> 1:01:22.295
- [Jon] You good?

1:01:22.378 --> 1:01:25.072
- [Flint] Not even close, you maniac!
- [Jon] Gotcha.

1:01:25.155 --> 1:01:26.886
Well, you see that closet next to you?

1:01:26.969 --> 1:01:27.770
- [Flint] Uh-huh.

1:01:27.853 --> 1:01:30.086
- [Jon] Get inside and wait five seconds.

1:01:30.169 --> 1:01:33.761
(Wooden door creaking)

1:01:34.511 --> 1:01:35.944
- [Flint] Okay, I'm there.

1:01:36.027 --> 1:01:37.016
- [Jon] In three

1:01:37.099 --> 1:01:38.693
two

1:01:38.776 --> 1:01:39.592
(guns firing)

1:01:39.675 --> 1:01:41.777
(Men screaming)

1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:44.236
- [Flint] Holy crap, we're doing it!

1:01:44.319 --> 1:01:45.538
- [Jon] Now, the hard one.

1:01:45.621 --> 1:01:47.121
- [Flint] Now the hard one?

1:01:47.204 --> 1:01:48.025
- [Jon] The third guy is hiding

1:01:48.108 --> 1:01:49.179
because he knows his compadres

1:01:49.262 --> 1:01:50.752
are all getting gunned down

1:01:50.835 --> 1:01:52.478
and doesn't want to be next,

1:01:52.561 --> 1:01:53.828
but you can't go get my mom yet

1:01:53.911 --> 1:01:57.372
because he'll be waiting for
that exact moment to strike.

1:01:57.455 --> 1:01:58.370
- [Flint] Where is he?

1:01:58.453 --> 1:01:59.517
- [Jon] Halfway up the stairs,

1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:01.180
there's a room with a big door.

1:02:01.263 --> 1:02:02.575
That's the living quarters.

1:02:02.658 --> 1:02:03.758
He's in there,

1:02:03.841 --> 1:02:05.152
right behind the door,

1:02:05.235 --> 1:02:08.482
listening to everything
that you're saying right now.

1:02:08.565 --> 1:02:09.780
- [Flint] Oh.

1:02:09.863 --> 1:02:10.972
Right.

1:02:11.055 --> 1:02:12.175
What do I do?

1:02:12.258 --> 1:02:13.187
- [Jon] You need to get close enough

1:02:13.270 --> 1:02:15.540
to fire everything you have at that door.

1:02:15.623 --> 1:02:16.752
- [Flint] Okay.

1:02:16.835 --> 1:02:19.519
(Floorboards creaking)

1:02:27.258 --> 1:02:29.879
(Guns firing)

1:02:30.007 --> 1:02:31.337
(Glass shattering)

1:02:35.118 --> 1:02:37.045
- [Flint] You owe me so big.

1:02:37.128 --> 1:02:38.506
- [Jon] I knew you could do it.

1:02:38.589 --> 1:02:39.923
- [Flint] Yeah, whatever.

1:02:40.006 --> 1:02:41.888
You're paying for therapy.

1:02:41.971 --> 1:02:43.651
- [Jon] Get downstairs as soon as you can!

1:02:43.905 --> 1:02:46.776
(Floorboards creaking)

1:02:49.785 --> 1:02:52.147
- [Flint] I see an opening on the floor.

1:02:52.230 --> 1:02:55.117
(Metal hinge creaking)

1:02:59.509 --> 1:03:00.569
Mrs. C?

1:03:00.652 --> 1:03:02.200
(Woman screaming)

1:03:02.283 --> 1:03:03.935
- [Jon] Now, flint!

1:03:04.018 --> 1:03:05.823
(Wood creaking)

1:03:14.562 --> 1:03:15.277
Flint, you there?

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:16.662
Mom?!

1:03:19.635 --> 1:03:20.528
- [Flint] Got her.

1:03:20.611 --> 1:03:21.881
- [Jon] Oh, thank god.

1:03:21.964 --> 1:03:23.889
- [Flint] Jon, there's
something else down here.

1:03:23.972 --> 1:03:24.838
- [Jon] What is it?

1:03:24.921 --> 1:03:26.954
- [Flint] There's a bunch of Manila folders

1:03:27.037 --> 1:03:30.107
on a desk of pictures of people inside,

1:03:30.190 --> 1:03:33.251
and it all says deceased.

1:03:33.334 --> 1:03:34.100
- [Jon] That's weird.

1:03:34.183 --> 1:03:35.896
All right, grab 'em and get out of there.

1:03:35.979 --> 1:03:36.954
It's only a matter of time

1:03:37.037 --> 1:03:39.641
before Graham or some other
hunter shows up and includes you

1:03:39.724 --> 1:03:41.879
in that list of dead people.

1:03:41.962 --> 1:03:44.387
- [Flint] You don't have to tell me twice.

1:03:44.470 --> 1:03:45.642
- [Jon] And flint?

1:03:45.725 --> 1:03:47.289
- [Flint] Yeah?
- [Jon] Make sure my mom

1:03:47.372 --> 1:03:48.947
gets somewhere safe.

1:03:49.030 --> 1:03:49.923
- [Flint] You know I will.

1:03:50.006 --> 1:03:51.485
- [Jon] Call me when you get back home.

1:03:51.568 --> 1:03:52.291
- [Flint] Alright, bud.

1:03:52.374 --> 1:03:53.606
Talk to you later.

1:03:53.689 --> 1:03:54.656
- [Jon] Later.

1:03:55.491 --> 1:03:57.072
(Ringtone)

1:03:59.610 --> 1:04:00.803
- Everybody safe?

1:04:00.886 --> 1:04:01.623
- Yeah, man.

1:04:01.706 --> 1:04:03.131
I took your mom to...

1:04:03.214 --> 1:04:04.381
- ahh, don't tell me.

1:04:04.464 --> 1:04:06.472
We don't know what the
hunters are capable of,

1:04:06.555 --> 1:04:08.100
or if they're listening right now.

1:04:08.183 --> 1:04:10.133
It's best to keep that a secret right now.

1:04:10.216 --> 1:04:11.646
- Smart.

1:04:11.729 --> 1:04:15.546
- But as long as she's safe
and you're good, I'm happy.

1:04:15.629 --> 1:04:16.908
Seriously, thank you for doing that.

1:04:16.991 --> 1:04:18.486
I know it had to have been difficult.

1:04:18.569 --> 1:04:21.980
- Difficult doesn't even
begin to define it, man.

1:04:22.063 --> 1:04:24.363
- I know.
I know, and I appreciate you so much,

1:04:24.446 --> 1:04:25.342
and as soon as I get back...

1:04:25.425 --> 1:04:28.496
(Grunting)

1:04:28.579 --> 1:04:30.587
- What is it!

1:04:30.670 --> 1:04:32.867
(Grunting)

1:04:32.950 --> 1:04:34.433
Jon, what is it?

1:04:34.516 --> 1:04:36.545
(Grunting)

1:04:40.232 --> 1:04:42.152
What is it!

1:04:42.235 --> 1:04:46.154
- Do you still have that
remote desktop app installed?

1:04:46.237 --> 1:04:47.682
- Dude, what?

1:04:47.765 --> 1:04:48.778
- Can I...

1:04:48.861 --> 1:04:49.675
Can I just...

1:04:49.758 --> 1:04:51.392
Can I log in real quick?

1:04:51.475 --> 1:04:52.619
- Okay?

1:04:55.745 --> 1:04:58.689
(Typing)

1:05:14.352 --> 1:05:17.578
Uh, nice shape, Jon.

1:05:17.661 --> 1:05:19.526
- [Jon] It's not just a shape.

1:05:19.609 --> 1:05:20.689
- [Flint] What is it?

1:05:20.772 --> 1:05:22.212
- [Jon] I don't know.

1:05:22.295 --> 1:05:24.446
- Bro, your nose!

1:05:29.366 --> 1:05:31.024
- Uh oh.

1:07:02.990 --> 1:07:05.587
(Ringtone)

1:07:06.890 --> 1:07:08.703
- Are you seeing what I'm
seeing with all these people?

1:07:08.786 --> 1:07:10.487
- Yeah, they're all dead.

1:07:10.570 --> 1:07:12.459
- They all died of the same thing.

1:07:12.542 --> 1:07:14.595
Blood diathesis.

1:07:14.678 --> 1:07:16.117
Look that up really quick.

1:07:27.524 --> 1:07:30.070
- [Flint] Looks like blood diathesis means

1:07:30.619 --> 1:07:33.781
tendency to bruise or bleed

1:07:33.864 --> 1:07:37.003
and it can range from mild to severe.

1:07:37.086 --> 1:07:38.701
- Well, if they all died
from the same thing,

1:07:38.784 --> 1:07:40.211
I'm guessing it's pretty severe.

1:07:40.294 --> 1:07:41.530
Plus, all of these people died

1:07:41.613 --> 1:07:44.412
apparently two months
after their date of ascension.

1:07:44.495 --> 1:07:46.067
Otherwise known as, I'm guessing,

1:07:46.150 --> 1:07:48.123
their trip through the secret seam.

1:07:49.321 --> 1:07:50.028
Which seals it.

1:07:50.111 --> 1:07:51.215
I guess in two months time,

1:07:51.298 --> 1:07:53.003
I'm dead, too.

1:07:56.578 --> 1:07:59.323
- [Flint] Woah, hold on.
Open Richard Hawkins.

1:07:59.406 --> 1:08:00.696
- [Jon] Okay.

1:08:02.950 --> 1:08:04.782
- [Flint] He's not dead.

1:08:04.865 --> 1:08:06.443
- [Jon] No he's not.

1:08:06.526 --> 1:08:07.838
- [Flint] You know who he is?

1:08:07.921 --> 1:08:09.209
- [Jon] Not even a little bit.

1:08:09.292 --> 1:08:10.734
- [Flint] That's Richard!

1:08:10.817 --> 1:08:12.991
Chuck's producer on "the truth beyond".

1:08:13.497 --> 1:08:15.400
- [Jon] You're kidding, hold on.

1:08:15.778 --> 1:08:18.066
(Ringtone)

1:08:19.495 --> 1:08:22.004
- Yo, I was just about to start my show.

1:08:22.087 --> 1:08:23.758
What's goin' on?

1:08:23.841 --> 1:08:25.416
Hey man, you doin' okay?

1:08:25.499 --> 1:08:26.261
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1:08:26.344 --> 1:08:28.863
We actually called to talk to Richard.

1:08:28.946 --> 1:08:30.146
Is he there?

1:08:30.229 --> 1:08:32.509
- Yeah, he's sitting
right here staring at me.

1:08:33.665 --> 1:08:35.010
- Hand him the phone.

1:08:35.093 --> 1:08:36.271
- Um, alright.

1:08:36.354 --> 1:08:37.520
Just a second.

1:08:37.603 --> 1:08:39.321
- Can I help you guys?

1:08:39.404 --> 1:08:43.506
- Yeah, you can start by telling us
what you know about the secret seam.

1:08:43.589 --> 1:08:45.142
(Sighs)

1:08:45.225 --> 1:08:46.620
- Look.

1:08:46.703 --> 1:08:49.539
I was younger than I am now,

1:08:49.622 --> 1:08:51.486
and I was much more impressionable.

1:08:51.569 --> 1:08:53.811
When Chuck would do his
episodes on the secret seam,

1:08:53.894 --> 1:08:56.631
I would be really invested.

1:08:56.714 --> 1:08:57.934
I wanted to find the seam

1:08:58.017 --> 1:09:00.745
as much as anyone else did, and hey,

1:09:00.828 --> 1:09:02.651
I did.

1:09:02.734 --> 1:09:04.124
- But why aren't you dead?

1:09:04.207 --> 1:09:05.412
- Jonathon,

1:09:05.495 --> 1:09:06.834
did you write the code yet?

1:09:06.917 --> 1:09:08.614
- Yeah, how did you know?

1:09:08.697 --> 1:09:11.498
- They all wrote the code, and so did I.

1:09:11.581 --> 1:09:13.169
The answers that you're looking for

1:09:13.252 --> 1:09:14.847
are in that code.

1:09:14.930 --> 1:09:16.937
I just... Mm.

1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:20.419
I shouldn't tell you this.

1:09:20.502 --> 1:09:21.926
- Tell us.

1:09:22.009 --> 1:09:23.590
- Just like anything else in the world,

1:09:23.673 --> 1:09:25.537
there's more than one way to skin a cat.

1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:26.687
Okay?

1:09:26.770 --> 1:09:29.638
So, there's a lot more to
that code than you think

1:09:29.721 --> 1:09:31.678
or could possibly imagine.

1:09:31.761 --> 1:09:33.111
- Like what?

1:09:33.194 --> 1:09:34.753
- I'm sorry.

1:09:34.836 --> 1:09:36.359
I can't tell you, man.

1:09:36.442 --> 1:09:39.176
That's something you're gonna
have to find out for yourself.

1:09:39.259 --> 1:09:40.343
But

1:09:40.426 --> 1:09:41.523
good luck, Jonathon.

1:09:41.606 --> 1:09:43.166
- [Chuck] You knew where the seam was!?

1:09:43.947 --> 1:09:45.738
- Holy crap!

1:09:48.258 --> 1:09:50.485
(Ringtone)

1:09:54.060 --> 1:09:56.248
- You think you're smart, don't you?

1:09:57.979 --> 1:10:00.100
Taking the queen?

1:10:00.183 --> 1:10:00.801
- My mom's not your...

1:10:00.884 --> 1:10:02.550
- no, not your mom, you idiot.

1:10:02.633 --> 1:10:03.424
The queen!

1:10:03.507 --> 1:10:04.939
The queen from chess?

1:10:05.022 --> 1:10:05.927
- Never played.

1:10:06.010 --> 1:10:07.037
- You've never?

1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:08.375
You know what, nevermind.

1:10:08.458 --> 1:10:09.543
It doesn't matter.

1:10:09.626 --> 1:10:10.686
This isn't over.

1:10:10.769 --> 1:10:11.674
- Pretty sure it is.

1:10:11.757 --> 1:10:14.528
- How's your nosebleeds?

1:10:14.611 --> 1:10:16.772
Still just from the nose?

1:10:17.355 --> 1:10:18.243
- What do you want?

1:10:18.326 --> 1:10:19.557
- Same as before.

1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:23.366
I want exodus, and
I'm still willing to trade.

1:10:23.449 --> 1:10:24.347
- I already have my mom.

1:10:24.430 --> 1:10:25.139
What else could you...

1:10:25.222 --> 1:10:27.322
- An antidote.
- What?

1:10:27.405 --> 1:10:28.999
- I have an antidote.

1:10:29.082 --> 1:10:31.193
Trial runs prove that it works

1:10:31.276 --> 1:10:32.778
and it could be yours.

1:10:32.861 --> 1:10:34.295
Just get me exodus.

1:10:35.457 --> 1:10:37.043
- Give me 24 more hours.

1:10:37.126 --> 1:10:37.874
- Not a chance.

1:10:37.957 --> 1:10:39.787
I saw what you did with 24.

1:10:39.870 --> 1:10:41.008
You have two hours.

1:10:41.091 --> 1:10:42.458
Take it or leave it.

1:10:42.541 --> 1:10:43.275
- Fine.

1:10:43.358 --> 1:10:45.721
I'll call you back with a
plan for the exchange.

1:10:45.804 --> 1:10:46.851
- Fine.

1:10:46.934 --> 1:10:48.476
No funny business.

1:10:48.995 --> 1:10:50.494
- I wouldn't dream of it.

1:10:55.331 --> 1:10:57.381
- [Flint] Jon, we can't do two hours.

1:10:57.464 --> 1:10:59.505
- No, we can't, and
it's less than that now.

1:10:59.588 --> 1:11:01.098
We need to figure out what we're doing.

1:11:01.181 --> 1:11:03.983
- Okay, well, Richard said that
the key to all of our problems

1:11:04.066 --> 1:11:07.665
is in that code thingy you wrote out.

1:11:07.748 --> 1:11:08.580
Right? - Yeah.

1:11:08.663 --> 1:11:10.190
- Open that up.

1:11:14.519 --> 1:11:15.616
- [Flint] Well, what are we waiting for?

1:11:15.699 --> 1:11:17.119
Use your intuition.

1:11:19.884 --> 1:11:20.818
- Code?

1:11:20.901 --> 1:11:22.659
Code within a code.

1:11:22.742 --> 1:11:24.390
- Okay.

1:11:36.059 --> 1:11:37.441
Well, that's something, at least.

1:11:37.524 --> 1:11:40.548
- Fcb/ln2

1:11:40.631 --> 1:11:41.883
fcb.

1:11:41.966 --> 1:11:44.159
Where have I heard
those three letters before?

1:11:44.242 --> 1:11:46.086
- Facebook?

1:11:46.169 --> 1:11:47.654
- Yeah, right.

1:11:47.737 --> 1:11:48.680
No, flint.

1:11:48.763 --> 1:11:51.215
Go back to the flashdrive.

1:11:51.298 --> 1:11:54.361
Go to the images folder
and choose the last one.

1:11:54.444 --> 1:11:55.957
- Oh yeah!

1:12:05.771 --> 1:12:07.409
So, that explains fcb,

1:12:07.492 --> 1:12:09.363
but what about the rest?

1:12:09.446 --> 1:12:10.539
- [Jon] Google it.

1:12:10.622 --> 1:12:11.706
- [Flint] Give me a second.

1:12:24.636 --> 1:12:27.928
Dark matter, like black holes?

1:12:28.011 --> 1:12:29.741
- No, not exactly.

1:12:29.824 --> 1:12:33.642
I feel like dark matter is everywhere.

1:12:33.725 --> 1:12:36.906
- [Flint] Yeah, dark matter
is the most mysterious,

1:12:36.989 --> 1:12:40.030
non-interacting substance in the universe.

1:12:40.113 --> 1:12:42.740
Its gravitational effects are necessary

1:12:42.823 --> 1:12:46.886
to explain the rotation of galaxies.
- Right, yeah.

1:12:46.969 --> 1:12:49.841
Dark matter is supposed to
have this great gravitational pull.

1:12:49.924 --> 1:12:53.276
That's why it's such a
popular theory with black holes.

1:12:53.359 --> 1:12:54.349
You can't see it.

1:12:54.432 --> 1:12:56.055
No lights coming through, but it is there,

1:12:56.138 --> 1:12:57.610
and its sucking everything through.

1:12:57.693 --> 1:13:01.911
- Wait, is this saying the
seam itself is a black hole?

1:13:01.994 --> 1:13:04.710
- No, I would seriously doubt
the secret seam was created

1:13:04.793 --> 1:13:07.184
by a black hole because I was there

1:13:07.267 --> 1:13:09.834
and I never felt a
gravitational pull towards it.

1:13:09.917 --> 1:13:12.082
I voluntarily walked through.

1:13:12.165 --> 1:13:14.636
- All right, this looks
like a job for Chuck.

1:13:15.535 --> 1:13:17.097
(Ringtone)

1:13:18.972 --> 1:13:20.134
- Gentlemen.

1:13:20.217 --> 1:13:22.556
- Got a bit of a mystery for you to solve.

1:13:22.639 --> 1:13:24.378
- I mean, don't you always?

1:13:24.461 --> 1:13:26.250
I'll put on my thinking cap.

1:13:26.716 --> 1:13:27.755
- All right, so apparently,

1:13:27.838 --> 1:13:30.983
the secret seam is made from dark matter.

1:13:31.066 --> 1:13:33.841
This does make sense
because it's nearly invisible

1:13:33.924 --> 1:13:35.894
to the naked eye, but it doesn't make sense

1:13:35.977 --> 1:13:39.777
because I never felt a gravitational
force when I was right next to it.

1:13:39.860 --> 1:13:42.316
- I get it, but you gotta think.

1:13:42.399 --> 1:13:44.568
Something has to be
containing the dark matter.

1:13:44.651 --> 1:13:45.863
- Yeah, or something.

1:13:45.946 --> 1:13:47.452
- I have an idea.

1:13:47.535 --> 1:13:49.848
It's probably a stretch, but hear me out.

1:13:49.931 --> 1:13:51.005
- We're all ears.

1:13:51.088 --> 1:13:53.103
- Typically, whenever you
have a gravitational pull

1:13:53.186 --> 1:13:56.372
of any kind, the only thing
that's gonna cancel it out

1:13:56.455 --> 1:13:59.289
is another gravitational
pull from a different direction.

1:13:59.372 --> 1:14:01.393
- You mean like two opposing magnets.

1:14:01.476 --> 1:14:02.413
- Exactly.

1:14:02.496 --> 1:14:03.628
More than likely,

1:14:03.711 --> 1:14:05.667
you're looking for another seam.

1:14:05.750 --> 1:14:06.979
- Holy crap!

1:14:07.062 --> 1:14:08.542
Exodus is another seam.

1:14:08.625 --> 1:14:10.238
Thanks, Chuck!

1:14:10.321 --> 1:14:11.413
- My pleasure.

1:14:11.496 --> 1:14:13.012
Keep me posted.

1:14:13.863 --> 1:14:16.163
- Okay, so now that we know
that there's another seam,

1:14:16.246 --> 1:14:17.374
what do we do?

1:14:17.457 --> 1:14:20.396
- Honestly, I say we learn everything
that we can on the knights of Pythias,

1:14:20.479 --> 1:14:23.076
since that was a part of the code, as well.

1:14:34.473 --> 1:14:36.654
- [Flint] Okay, the knights of Pythias

1:14:36.737 --> 1:14:40.941
was a secret society founded in 1864

1:14:41.024 --> 1:14:43.319
in Washington D.C.

1:14:43.946 --> 1:14:46.346
(Mouse scrolling)

1:14:56.134 --> 1:14:58.875
The fraternal order knights of Pythias

1:14:58.958 --> 1:15:03.700
was founded on this site 914 e street N.W.

1:15:03.783 --> 1:15:07.502
On February 19, 1864.

1:15:07.585 --> 1:15:12.282
Charter granted by
President Lincoln, what!?

1:15:12.365 --> 1:15:14.957
- What was that address again?

1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:19.399
- 914 e street, N.W.

1:15:19.482 --> 1:15:22.383
- And that's in Washington, D.C.?

1:15:22.466 --> 1:15:25.862
- [Flint] Doesn't say on
the plaque, but I imagine so.

1:15:34.182 --> 1:15:35.257
- Dude.

1:15:35.340 --> 1:15:36.518
- What?

1:15:36.601 --> 1:15:38.754
- You are not going to believe this.

1:15:38.837 --> 1:15:40.177
- What is it?

1:15:40.260 --> 1:15:42.155
- Look up that address on Google maps

1:15:42.238 --> 1:15:44.552
and tell me it's not a coincidence.

1:15:44.635 --> 1:15:45.906
- Okay.

1:15:47.963 --> 1:15:50.708
(Typing)

1:16:00.910 --> 1:16:02.905
(Mouse scrolling)

1:16:06.261 --> 1:16:07.522
The FBI?

1:16:07.605 --> 1:16:09.737
- My thoughts exactly.

1:16:09.820 --> 1:16:11.002
I just looked it up.

1:16:11.085 --> 1:16:14.811
The FBI wasn't even
founded until another 40 years

1:16:14.894 --> 1:16:17.673
after the knights of Pythias showed up,

1:16:17.756 --> 1:16:19.216
so nowhere on Wikipedia

1:16:19.299 --> 1:16:20.719
or their official website

1:16:20.802 --> 1:16:24.245
does it say anything
about the FBI, come on.

1:16:24.328 --> 1:16:25.868
- What do you think it means?

1:16:25.951 --> 1:16:27.715
- I'll tell you a theory I just had.

1:16:27.798 --> 1:16:28.936
- Go for it.

1:16:29.019 --> 1:16:30.588
- What if the knights of Pythias,

1:16:30.671 --> 1:16:31.950
being a secret society,

1:16:32.033 --> 1:16:34.512
originally had the
information on both seams,

1:16:34.595 --> 1:16:35.809
but for whatever reason

1:16:35.892 --> 1:16:37.816
became too dangerous to keep in one place

1:16:37.899 --> 1:16:39.092
at the same time.

1:16:39.175 --> 1:16:40.971
So, they split up,

1:16:41.054 --> 1:16:42.333
and lets say

1:16:42.416 --> 1:16:43.752
the original knights of Pythias,

1:16:43.835 --> 1:16:46.556
they decided to take the information
of the tomb of the unknown soldier

1:16:46.639 --> 1:16:47.392
with them.

1:16:47.475 --> 1:16:49.470
That's why we see the insignia
of the knights on the back

1:16:49.553 --> 1:16:51.603
of the Cypher, on the
back of the grille, all that.

1:16:51.686 --> 1:16:52.990
But what happens over here?

1:16:53.073 --> 1:16:54.749
What if, now just hear me out.

1:16:54.832 --> 1:16:57.847
What if fcb... Changed to FBI,

1:16:57.930 --> 1:17:01.891
and FBI has the information on exodus.

1:17:01.974 --> 1:17:03.566
- Certainly plausible.

1:17:03.649 --> 1:17:06.867
We've definitely seen
crazier throughout this journey.

1:17:06.950 --> 1:17:08.249
- Exactly.

1:17:08.332 --> 1:17:10.325
- What do we do now?

1:17:10.408 --> 1:17:11.515
- Now?

1:17:11.598 --> 1:17:13.321
Now we need to do something about Graham.

1:17:16.893 --> 1:17:17.900
- [Jon] Hey, you there?

1:17:17.983 --> 1:17:19.188
- [Flint] Yeah.
- [Jon] Okay. (Ringing)

1:17:19.271 --> 1:17:20.888
I need you to be quiet while I talk to him.

1:17:20.971 --> 1:17:22.814
He can be kind of temperamental. (Ringing)

1:17:22.897 --> 1:17:23.909
So, just... (Ringing)

1:17:23.992 --> 1:17:26.330
- [Graham] I was beginning to
wonder if you'd have the spine

1:17:26.413 --> 1:17:27.925
to call me back.

1:17:28.008 --> 1:17:30.137
How's the nose bleeds?

1:17:30.220 --> 1:17:32.140
- [Jon] You wanna talk business or what?

1:17:32.223 --> 1:17:33.723
- [Graham] You got exodus?

1:17:33.806 --> 1:17:34.566
- [Jon] Yeah.

1:17:34.649 --> 1:17:36.605
- [Graham] Are you lying to me, boy?

1:17:36.688 --> 1:17:38.899
- [Jon] I guess there's
only one way to find out.

1:17:38.982 --> 1:17:40.437
(Sighs)

1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:42.054
- [Graham] Where do you want to do this?

1:17:42.137 --> 1:17:43.391
- [Jon] Meet me at the parking lot

1:17:43.474 --> 1:17:47.469
at 2799 Richmond
highway, Arlington, Virginia.

1:17:47.552 --> 1:17:48.814
- [Graham] Hey, kid.

1:17:48.897 --> 1:17:50.448
- [Jon] What?

1:17:50.531 --> 1:17:53.513
- [Graham] Look outside.

1:17:53.596 --> 1:17:56.875
(Blinds retracting)

1:17:59.335 --> 1:18:00.900
- [Jon] You've been here the whole time?

1:18:00.983 --> 1:18:02.876
- [Graham] Why do you
think I wasn't at the lighthouse?

1:18:02.959 --> 1:18:06.190
Get down here before I
have to come up there.

1:18:06.558 --> 1:18:08.048
- [Jon] Fine, just a moment.

1:18:08.256 --> 1:18:09.700
(Phone line ends)

1:18:09.783 --> 1:18:11.256
You still there?

1:18:11.339 --> 1:18:13.012
- [Flint] Yeah, that guy sounds serious.

1:18:13.095 --> 1:18:16.458
Are you really gonna give
him the location to exodus?

1:18:16.541 --> 1:18:17.229
- [Jon] No.

1:18:17.312 --> 1:18:18.801
I'm gonna give him
what he wanted all along.

1:18:18.884 --> 1:18:20.499
The thing that he was
willing to kill my stepfather

1:18:20.582 --> 1:18:22.033
and kidnap my mom over.

1:18:22.116 --> 1:18:23.710
I'm giving him the flashdrive,

1:18:23.793 --> 1:18:25.711
or at least a copy of it.

1:18:25.794 --> 1:18:27.525
- [Flint] Do you really
think that's the best idea?

1:18:27.608 --> 1:18:30.075
That says nothing about exodus.

1:18:30.158 --> 1:18:31.666
- [Jon] Yeah, I know
that, and you know that,

1:18:31.749 --> 1:18:33.199
but he doesn't.

1:18:33.282 --> 1:18:35.827
Because if he always knew
where the first seam was,

1:18:35.910 --> 1:18:38.510
then he must have
believed that my stepfather

1:18:38.593 --> 1:18:42.032
had more information on
exodus, which he didn't.

1:18:42.115 --> 1:18:43.761
So, he killed him for nothing.

1:18:43.844 --> 1:18:45.066
- [Flint] I'm sorry, man.

1:18:45.149 --> 1:18:47.024
(Sighs) - [Jon] I gotta go.

1:18:55.105 --> 1:18:58.392
- We finally meet face-to-face.

1:18:58.475 --> 1:19:00.980
- You know, I recognize your voice now.

1:19:01.063 --> 1:19:04.906
I thought I heard it before,
but now I remember.

1:19:04.989 --> 1:19:07.531
It was you at my house
that night, wasn't it?

1:19:07.614 --> 1:19:08.633
- Ah yes.

1:19:08.716 --> 1:19:11.065
I am the one who killed your stepfather,

1:19:11.148 --> 1:19:13.918
but to be fair, he kinda deserved it.

1:19:14.001 --> 1:19:17.517
After all, he did kill
my right-hand man first.

1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:19.571
Now, no more delays.

1:19:19.654 --> 1:19:20.776
Exodus.

1:19:20.859 --> 1:19:21.768
Hand it over.

1:19:21.851 --> 1:19:24.447
- You killed my stepfather
over this piece of plastic.

1:19:24.530 --> 1:19:26.485
- And I would do it again.

1:19:26.568 --> 1:19:28.547
Meanwhile.

1:19:28.630 --> 1:19:31.590
This little thing determines
whether or not you live or die.

1:19:31.673 --> 1:19:33.407
- Richard took that antidote, didn't he?

1:19:33.490 --> 1:19:34.842
That's why he survived.

1:19:34.925 --> 1:19:36.998
- Oh.

1:19:37.081 --> 1:19:38.757
You found Mr. Hawkins.

1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:41.371
- What did he have
to sacrifice to get that?

1:19:41.454 --> 1:19:44.307
- He gave me your stepfather.

1:19:48.004 --> 1:19:49.922
- Let's just get this over with.

1:19:56.745 --> 1:19:58.896
- Pleasure doing business with you.

1:20:04.921 --> 1:20:07.086
- Well, how'd it go?

1:20:07.169 --> 1:20:09.524
- It's over.

1:20:09.607 --> 1:20:11.937
It's all over.

1:20:12.020 --> 1:20:13.947
Can you guys see it?

1:20:14.030 --> 1:20:17.034
- Yeah, we see it all right.

1:20:17.117 --> 1:20:18.729
- We can finally put all of this behind...

1:20:18.812 --> 1:20:20.973
Oh god.

1:20:21.056 --> 1:20:22.149
- What now? - Well...

1:20:22.232 --> 1:20:24.308
- You're gonna have to
be put on hold for a second.

1:20:24.391 --> 1:20:25.443
Graham's calling.

1:20:25.526 --> 1:20:26.971
- It's been like two minutes.
- Yeah, I know.

1:20:27.054 --> 1:20:29.412
- Yeah?

1:20:29.495 --> 1:20:31.357
- You think I wouldn't notice?

1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:34.247
You think I wouldn't expect a trick?

1:20:34.330 --> 1:20:35.583
- I guess not.

1:20:35.666 --> 1:20:36.784
- I told you.

1:20:36.867 --> 1:20:38.958
No funny business.

1:20:39.041 --> 1:20:40.273
- Can you blame me?

1:20:40.356 --> 1:20:41.575
- No matter.

1:20:41.658 --> 1:20:44.773
If you leave me with nothing,
I leave you with nothing.

1:20:44.856 --> 1:20:45.455
(Shattering)

1:20:45.538 --> 1:20:47.476
- What did you do?

1:20:47.559 --> 1:20:50.634
- Returning the favor
of stripping you of hope.

1:20:50.717 --> 1:20:51.777
- Hey, Graham.

1:20:51.860 --> 1:20:54.067
- What is it?

1:20:54.150 --> 1:20:56.527
- You're not the only
person with trust issues.

1:20:56.610 --> 1:20:58.325
- Oh?

1:20:58.408 --> 1:20:59.660
- Yeah, you've been a little bit sloppy

1:20:59.743 --> 1:21:01.995
in your pursuit of exodus,
haven't you, Graham?

1:21:02.078 --> 1:21:03.463
I've been documenting my entire experience

1:21:03.546 --> 1:21:05.063
with this thing from the get-go,

1:21:05.146 --> 1:21:06.355
and I have you and your men

1:21:06.438 --> 1:21:08.559
trying to kill me everywhere I go.

1:21:08.642 --> 1:21:11.587
So, I took that footage
and I sent it to the police

1:21:11.670 --> 1:21:13.236
to prove that hunters are real.

1:21:13.319 --> 1:21:13.998
- Please.

1:21:14.081 --> 1:21:15.200
You think they'll find me?

1:21:15.283 --> 1:21:16.822
I operate in the shadows.

1:21:16.905 --> 1:21:19.101
Not existing is my business.

1:21:19.184 --> 1:21:20.800
Yeah, I figured you might
say something like that.

1:21:20.883 --> 1:21:22.972
That's why I included an incredibly basic

1:21:23.055 --> 1:21:24.524
and portable executable file

1:21:24.607 --> 1:21:27.011
that runs automatically when
you plug it into a computer,

1:21:27.094 --> 1:21:28.550
which I knew you would,

1:21:28.633 --> 1:21:29.884
and what does that program do?

1:21:29.967 --> 1:21:31.628
It tracks your location

1:21:31.711 --> 1:21:35.499
and it sends the results
to any recipient that I pick.

1:21:35.582 --> 1:21:37.195
Good luck staying in those shadows, Graham.

1:21:37.278 --> 1:21:38.479
(Door crashing open)

1:21:38.562 --> 1:21:39.361
- [Police] Hands on your head!

1:21:39.444 --> 1:21:41.387
- No!

1:21:44.523 --> 1:21:46.113
- [Mom] Hello?

1:21:46.196 --> 1:21:47.223
- [Jon] Hey, mom.

1:21:47.306 --> 1:21:49.310
- [Mom] Jonathon, are you all right?

1:21:49.393 --> 1:21:50.923
- Yeah, mom, I'm fine.

1:21:51.006 --> 1:21:54.331
Listen, I just wanted to call to
make sure that's you're okay.

1:21:55.015 --> 1:21:56.610
Are you okay?

1:21:56.693 --> 1:21:58.337
- [Mom] I'm a little shook
up about everything,

1:21:58.420 --> 1:22:00.144
but I'm doing better every day.

1:22:00.227 --> 1:22:00.944
- [Jon] Yeah.

1:22:01.027 --> 1:22:03.141
Yeah, I'm sorry that you
had to go through all that

1:22:03.224 --> 1:22:05.331
and I never got to talk
to you about the general.

1:22:07.118 --> 1:22:08.077
Hey.

1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:10.129
Did I ever tell you my
favorite story of him?

1:22:10.212 --> 1:22:11.732
- [Mom] No.

1:22:11.999 --> 1:22:13.546
- [Jon] So, I was eight,

1:22:13.629 --> 1:22:15.980
and it was a couple
of years after dad died.

1:22:16.063 --> 1:22:17.727
The general wanted to
take me out to the woods

1:22:17.810 --> 1:22:19.632
to fire a gun for the first time,

1:22:19.715 --> 1:22:21.982
or at least watch him hunt.

1:22:22.065 --> 1:22:25.186
He figured it was gonna
be this big bonding moment,

1:22:25.269 --> 1:22:27.405
and at that age, I thought it was so cool,

1:22:27.488 --> 1:22:30.850
but on the way there, I saw
a dog on the side of the road.

1:22:30.933 --> 1:22:32.777
It had to have been just hit by a car

1:22:32.860 --> 1:22:35.822
and suddenly the prospect of
wanting to kill another animal

1:22:35.905 --> 1:22:37.891
died with that dog that we saw.

1:22:37.974 --> 1:22:40.065
He wasn't the biggest with his words,

1:22:40.148 --> 1:22:43.034
but the general looked at me and he said,

1:22:43.117 --> 1:22:45.007
"son, we all die some day.

1:22:45.090 --> 1:22:47.134
"The trick is making life worth the fight,

1:22:47.217 --> 1:22:50.255
"so that when that day comes,
you leave behind a legacy."

1:22:50.338 --> 1:22:52.632
And then he goes on to
tell me that I was his legacy.

1:22:52.715 --> 1:22:55.536
Later that day, we got Charlie.

1:22:55.619 --> 1:22:57.382
- [Mom] Our dog, Charlie?

1:22:57.465 --> 1:22:58.667
- [Jon] Yeah.

1:22:58.750 --> 1:23:02.076
Yeah, I shouldn't have fought
so hard all these years claiming

1:23:02.159 --> 1:23:03.795
that he wasn't my dad.

1:23:03.878 --> 1:23:07.573
I was stupid, stubborn, but I get it now.

1:23:07.656 --> 1:23:08.661
He was my dad.

1:23:08.744 --> 1:23:10.601
I just...

1:23:10.684 --> 1:23:12.778
I wish I could have told him thank you.

1:23:12.861 --> 1:23:15.066
- [Mom] He knew.

1:23:15.149 --> 1:23:16.538
- [Jon] Mom.

1:23:16.621 --> 1:23:17.976
- [Mom] Yes?

1:23:18.059 --> 1:23:20.870
- [Jon] I have one last thing
to do before this is all over.

1:23:20.953 --> 1:23:22.195
- [Mom] What is it?

1:23:22.278 --> 1:23:23.799
- [Jon] I can't tell you.

1:23:23.882 --> 1:23:26.881
But if it goes well, we
will see each other soon.

1:23:26.964 --> 1:23:30.178
If not, just know that I love you and...

1:23:30.261 --> 1:23:32.152
Thank you for being my mom.

1:23:32.235 --> 1:23:34.223
- [Mom] Jon...

1:23:34.306 --> 1:23:35.761
- [Jon] Bye.

1:23:40.135 --> 1:23:40.805
- Alright, I'm here.

1:23:40.888 --> 1:23:43.195
Now, if I'm right, this is
where I'm supposed to go,

1:23:43.278 --> 1:23:46.240
and I'm leading myself entirely
through intuition at this point,

1:23:46.323 --> 1:23:47.941
but I mean, it feels right,

1:23:48.024 --> 1:23:49.260
I just don't know what it's all about,

1:23:49.343 --> 1:23:51.234
why I just know things I shouldn't know,

1:23:51.317 --> 1:23:52.769
but what I do know

1:23:52.852 --> 1:23:55.547
is that whatever I have is killing me

1:23:55.630 --> 1:23:58.562
and I need to move before a hunter sees me.

1:23:58.645 --> 1:23:59.534
So.

1:24:17.742 --> 1:24:20.452
So, my intuition's telling
me that this is the right door.

1:24:21.013 --> 1:24:22.670
(Locked door)

1:24:22.753 --> 1:24:23.853
No, no, no, no.

1:24:23.936 --> 1:24:24.720
No, this can't be happening.

1:24:24.803 --> 1:24:26.058
This can't be happening.

1:24:33.019 --> 1:24:34.780
What the?

1:24:40.013 --> 1:24:43.192
(Door unlocking)

1:24:44.306 --> 1:24:46.402
(Door shutting)

1:24:46.927 --> 1:24:48.115
I can't see anything.

1:24:49.092 --> 1:24:50.654
Where's the light switch?

1:24:55.229 --> 1:24:56.201
There it is.

1:24:59.103 --> 1:25:00.679
God.

1:25:03.311 --> 1:25:04.976
So, I don't know what's gonna happen next.

1:25:05.059 --> 1:25:07.209
I don't know what this all means, either.

1:25:07.292 --> 1:25:09.411
Why I have this intuition

1:25:09.494 --> 1:25:12.624
where I just know things
that I'm not supposed to know.

1:25:12.707 --> 1:25:15.461
I have no idea what's gonna
happen when I walk through exodus.

1:25:16.059 --> 1:25:17.261
I could die.

1:25:17.344 --> 1:25:18.925
I could get better.

1:25:19.008 --> 1:25:20.241
It could be anything in between.

1:25:20.324 --> 1:25:23.265
Jury's out, so anybody
who's watching this right now.

1:25:23.348 --> 1:25:27.376
This is just a reminder that
there is more to this world

1:25:27.459 --> 1:25:28.331
than you realize.

1:25:28.414 --> 1:25:31.430
There is magic, there is
wonder, there is the unexplained.

1:25:32.286 --> 1:25:33.200
You know?

1:25:33.283 --> 1:25:35.004
The secret seam exists,

1:25:35.087 --> 1:25:37.132
but that's not always a good thing.

1:25:37.983 --> 1:25:41.466
I'm gonna leave the camera
here rolling as I step into exodus.

1:25:42.391 --> 1:25:44.914
If I die, then tell the world.

1:25:44.997 --> 1:25:47.263
Use this footage that I've
collected over this experience

1:25:47.346 --> 1:25:50.205
and tell them about me, tell
them about the secret seam,

1:25:50.288 --> 1:25:52.042
tell them about exodus,
tell them about hunters,

1:25:52.125 --> 1:25:54.029
tell them about everything.

1:25:54.112 --> 1:25:56.830
People are dying over this thing.

1:25:56.913 --> 1:25:58.381
They are disappearing.

1:25:58.792 --> 1:26:00.383
Don't let me disappear with them.

1:26:23.722 --> 1:26:24.421
- Welcome back.

1:26:24.504 --> 1:26:25.953
Have you heard of the secret seam?

1:26:26.036 --> 1:26:29.580
Conspiracy theorists call it a
rip in the fabric of space and time.

1:26:29.663 --> 1:26:32.544
Now, according to government
officials, it doesn't exist,

1:26:32.627 --> 1:26:34.824
but that doesn't explain this footage,

1:26:34.907 --> 1:26:36.678
where a man is seen
entering what appears to be

1:26:36.761 --> 1:26:38.206
an impossible doorway

1:26:38.289 --> 1:26:41.275
before vanishing into thin
air along with the opening.

1:26:41.358 --> 1:26:43.905
Not much is known as to
how valid this footage is.

1:26:43.988 --> 1:26:46.760
What is known, though, is that
the man in question, Jonathon child,

1:26:46.843 --> 1:26:49.285
has been missing for the last two months.

1:26:49.368 --> 1:26:50.909
Many people believe him to be dead,

1:26:50.992 --> 1:26:52.600
but those among the conspiracy crowd

1:26:52.683 --> 1:26:54.982
believe Mr. Child is still out there

1:26:55.065 --> 1:26:57.453
and that fact may be stranger than fiction.

1:26:57.536 --> 1:26:59.998
Tonight, an anonymous
source sent in this image

1:27:00.081 --> 1:27:03.255
of a man that bear some
resemblance to Mr. Child.

1:27:03.338 --> 1:27:05.906
Now, experts aren't
available to confirm or deny

1:27:05.989 --> 1:27:07.536
that this is Jonathon child,

1:27:07.619 --> 1:27:10.263
and the case for his
disappearance remains open.

1:27:10.346 --> 1:27:13.256
However, if the man in the
image was not Mr. Child after all,

1:27:13.339 --> 1:27:15.099
then who was it?

1:27:15.182 --> 1:27:16.620
We'll leave you with this tonight.

1:27:16.703 --> 1:27:19.155
Thank you for watching KWOR nightly news.

1:27:19.238 --> 1:27:20.860
I'm Shawn Callaway signing off.

1:27:21.278 --> 1:27:22.253
Have a good night.

1:27:23.608 --> 1:27:26.300
