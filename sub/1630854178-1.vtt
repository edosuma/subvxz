That's right. That's good.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.642
Pour yourself a little drink.

00:32.666 --> 00:33.901
Yeah, I will pour myself...

00:33.968 --> 00:35.368
Yeah, pour yourself
a little drink.

00:35.435 --> 00:37.437
I will pour myself
a little drink.

00:40.908 --> 00:44.511
Peg, focus.
Look at me and stay focused.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.980
- Bunny...
- Right here, baby.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.849
What are we seeing,
what are we seeing?

00:50.084 --> 00:51.451
I'm trying to focus!

00:51.518 --> 00:53.386
- Not too hard, peg.
- I'm trying to focus!

00:53.453 --> 00:54.956
The tassels
are weighing you down.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.958
I think you gotta lose them
and take them off!

00:57.024 --> 00:58.192
Take the shirt off!

00:58.259 --> 00:59.903
I have it, I have it,
I have it, I have it.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.028

01:01.095 --> 01:02.263
Tip it a little bit.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.530
Oh!

01:03.597 --> 01:05.166
That's not fair!
Peg made her drop it!

01:05.233 --> 01:06.868
That doesn't count.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.669
Winner, winner,
cigarette dinner!

01:09.736 --> 01:11.839
That wasn't my fault! Hang on.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.817
- That is my drink.
- No, she pushed it off my head.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.675
- I'll finish that.
- No, but I can win.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.444
She just budged me.
It's not fair!

01:17.510 --> 01:18.745
I know you can win.

01:18.813 --> 01:19.923
- Mm-Kay. Are you sure?
- I know you can...

01:19.947 --> 01:22.449
Mm-Kay. Yeah.

01:22.515 --> 01:25.485
- You dropped it,
or was it my fault?
- It got on my dress.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.095
- can you please use an ashtray?
- What?

01:34.161 --> 01:35.305
Because if it gets on the rug,
it's impossible to get out.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.529
Pete, your wife is drunk.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.299
She's babbling
nonsense right now.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.634
And she's pregnant,
and so she needs another drink,

01:41.869 --> 01:43.337

- Excuse me, excuse me!
- Whoa!

Did this come with

-Look at this man.
Look at this.
-You know...

01:50.144 --> 01:52.184
Frank did a ceremony.
It's just like the one he has.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.547
-So gracious.
-Look at this.
Look at this man.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.117
Kiss the ring, baby.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.753

Oh, my god.
Look at... look at this love!

02:02.555 --> 02:03.834
Are you going

02:03.858 --> 02:05.226
- Yeah, is that...
- Mwah!

02:06.760 --> 02:10.932

02:10.998 --> 02:12.900
Upski downski!

02:16.871 --> 02:18.072
Thank you.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.241
- And these are for me!
- Those are all for you.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.143
Drink 'em all. Drink 'em all.

02:26.414 --> 02:29.083
You drink like a sailor
and look like a pin-up doll.

02:29.150 --> 02:32.853
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, god damn it.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.388
You want to go for a ride?

02:38.025 --> 02:40.127
I'm slipping out of the car!

02:41.628 --> 02:43.030
Oh, my god!

02:43.097 --> 02:44.332
You have to drive.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.133
It's your turn. Take the wheel!

02:46.200 --> 02:48.568
-Take the wheel!
Take the wheel!
-Oh, my god! What?

02:48.635 --> 02:50.195
- No, I'm not ready!
- I've driven us...

02:50.237 --> 02:52.505
- Oh, my god!
- I've driven us
more than enough.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.175
Alice, you're getting
so much better.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.143
I am. I feel better.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.878
You're getting so much better.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.546
Take me home, Alice.

02:59.612 --> 03:00.815
Take me home.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.216
What if you're blind?

03:02.283 --> 03:04.651
- No, I can't!
- Now do it. Now do it.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.887
You're doing so good!
You're doing so good!

03:08.655 --> 03:10.100
- All right, now straighten up.
- Can you help me?

03:10.124 --> 03:11.524
Straighten up.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.695
Good job.

03:23.237 --> 03:27.174
So then bunny said
that she wanted to play,
which, mm...

03:27.241 --> 03:29.276
She's never
played tennis before, ever.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.846
She has a cocktail in one hand,
a racket in the other,

03:31.912 --> 03:35.383
and, Jack...
She didn't spill a drop.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.318
It was...

03:37.385 --> 03:41.055
Quite possibly the sexiest
thing I have ever seen.

03:41.122 --> 03:42.522
<i>I want to see you
in a tennis skirt.</i>

03:42.555 --> 03:44.758
God...

03:44.825 --> 03:47.194
Do you think it's true
that frank actually has

03:47.261 --> 03:48.829
a tennis court at his house?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.232
- We'll find out, won't we?
- Yeah.

03:51.298 --> 03:54.235
Oh, and babe, tell me...

03:54.301 --> 03:57.405
How many people
are gonna be at this party,

03:57.471 --> 03:59.974
because I need to know
how much tuna salad to make.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.343
Mm.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.445
- What?
- Frank doesn't like tuna.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.414
- What?
- He doesn't like it.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.849
- Are you being serious?
- Mm-hm.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.451
Baby, why didn't you tell me?

04:10.518 --> 04:12.953
I was planning on it being
the centerpiece to my dish.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.456
- Alice, not the centerpiece.
- Shut up.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.159
Oh, no! Shit.

04:25.199 --> 04:26.133
Don't.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.567
- Was that a big drill?
- Don't.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.136
- Was that an explosion?
- Don't.

04:29.203 --> 04:30.981
- Are those
the progressive materials?
- Mm-hm.

04:31.005 --> 04:32.940
You can tell me. I'm...
I'm really discreet.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.351
- I can keep a secret.
- I'm going to be late.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.986
No, wait, you... you can't...
You can't leave.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.777
Why not?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.646
'Cause you're not feeling well.

04:39.712 --> 04:41.248
- Oh, I'm not?
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.160
I forgot to tell you, but
you're not feeling very well.

04:43.184 --> 04:45.953
And the only way to cure it
is if we stay home all day,

04:46.020 --> 04:48.489
and I tend to you
and kiss you and cook for...

04:48.556 --> 04:50.124
- Mm-hm.
- No.

04:50.191 --> 04:51.826
- Bye.
- Okay.

04:54.195 --> 04:56.729
Oh... Jack, wait!

04:58.698 --> 05:00.733
Bye-bye. Make us proud.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.385
I have some very exciting news.

07:31.452 --> 07:35.089
The victory project has hired
a new employee, bill Johnson,

07:35.155 --> 07:38.092
and I've invited his wife
to join us today.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.527
Everyone, please give
a warm welcome...

07:40.594 --> 07:42.795
To Violet Johnson.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.665
Welcome, Violet.

07:51.939 --> 07:55.209
Let's begin. First position.

07:55.276 --> 07:58.946
Remember, ladies,
there is beauty in control.

07:59.013 --> 08:03.083
There is grace in symmetry.
We move as one.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.015
Stomach in.

08:36.417 --> 08:37.417
Chin up.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.121
That's it.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.897
Yeah, of course
Margaret wasn't in class.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.799
I saw Dr. Collins
at their house again.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.033
No!

08:53.100 --> 08:54.444

Ted still has a job.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.470
- Again?
- Unwrap it from her neck, Fred!

08:56.537 --> 08:58.205
- Yeah.
- Oh, my god.

08:58.272 --> 08:59.673
- Poor guy.
- Oh! I met her.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.841
- Mm!
- The new wife.

09:00.908 --> 09:01.909
Violet.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.377
- Mm-hm.
- What's she like?

09:03.444 --> 09:06.246
She's like a beautiful,
terrified, baby deer.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.949
Yeah. Apparently,
the husband's a real goober.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.018
Well, Jack better
recruit somebody soon.

09:11.085 --> 09:13.120
Please! Dean says Jack's
about to get promoted.

09:13.187 --> 09:14.288
- I hope so.
- Mm-hm.

09:14.355 --> 09:15.824
You're gonna be right behind us.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.000
What are you making
for the party?

09:17.024 --> 09:18.325
- My deviled eggs.
- Oh, my god.

- Uh-oh.

09:23.364 --> 09:24.732
- You give me no choice.
- Oh, no.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.200
I have to call him. I have to!

09:26.266 --> 09:27.968
That's why Santa
gave me his number.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.512
He said I had to call
if you were bad.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.372
I'm calling him.
I wish I had a choice.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.140
- Give me that.
- But we stopped!

12:13.300 --> 12:15.269
I made a roast.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.570

There's so much... skin.

13:37.852 --> 13:40.054
Ooh, why don't you go
find your brother, okay?

13:43.223 --> 13:45.125
Okay, you have to stop humming
that song.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.526
- What is it?
- I don't know.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.062
I was hoping you could tell me.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.796
It's been stuck in my head
for days.

13:49.864 --> 13:51.608
Maybe it's a children's song.
Something your kids sing?

13:51.632 --> 13:53.333
Oh, no, I don't have children.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.702
- Oh.
- Mm. Don't get me started.

13:55.769 --> 13:58.472
It's just not what we want.
We're having fun.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.608
I live next door. You wouldn't
believe the things I've heard.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.311
It's like they're on
a perpetual honeymoon.

14:04.378 --> 14:06.613
No, Jack and Alice
only have time for each other.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.348
It's not what we want.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.259
Plus, bunny's kids
like me more than her, anyway.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.618
That's true, it's infuriating.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.255
I think three
is a perfect number.

14:15.322 --> 14:18.291
Bill wants four.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.494
Well, once you have one,
it's all the same.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.496
Having a second...

14:24.798 --> 14:26.834
Alice, how many babies
should Violet have?

14:26.901 --> 14:28.368
Oh, at least seven.

15:04.806 --> 15:07.041
Christ. Where have you been?

15:07.108 --> 15:08.843
I've turned avoiding
talking to other people

15:08.910 --> 15:10.477
into an olympic sport.

15:10.544 --> 15:12.722
- This place is incredible!
- You haven't seen half of it.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.691
I could sleep in their bathtub
and they'd never find me.

15:14.715 --> 15:16.017
I'm sure! Hi!

15:16.084 --> 15:17.384
Hey!

15:17.451 --> 15:18.953
May we interest you
in a cocktail?

15:19.020 --> 15:23.223
- Uh, yes, you may. Thank you.
- Yes, very interested.

15:26.094 --> 15:27.829
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

15:27.895 --> 15:29.596
Thank you.

15:29.663 --> 15:32.200
- They terrify me.
- They're so creepy.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.767
I feel like they
sleep upside down.

15:33.835 --> 15:35.675
- Do they wear matching outfits
every day?
- Oh!

15:35.736 --> 15:38.438
That little weirdo
makes the best Manhattan
I've ever had.

15:38.505 --> 15:39.941
We honeymooned in sea island.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.575
Oh!

15:41.641 --> 15:43.610
- What?
- We honeymooned in sea island.

15:43.677 --> 15:44.578
Seriously?

15:44.644 --> 15:45.856
Yeah, did you eat at Dominick's?

15:45.880 --> 15:47.882
I was a little nervous.

15:47.949 --> 15:49.516
Took a while
to get used to things.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.418
Yeah. It takes a minute
to settle in.

15:51.485 --> 15:53.286
- Yeah.
- But it gets easier, though.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.355
- It does. Yeah.
- Well, it...

15:55.422 --> 15:56.824
I'm just really excited
to be here.

15:56.891 --> 15:58.634
- So excited, I can't even...
- We couldn't tell.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.162
To be honest, I've been
out of it since we arrived.

16:01.229 --> 16:02.596
Yeah.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.841
- Bill says it's the jetlag.
- Mm-hm.

16:03.865 --> 16:05.732
It's all just been
a bit of a blur.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.567
It's the desert air.
You'll get used to it.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.603
That's what
Dr. Collins said, too.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.107
He was so sweet to stop by.

16:13.174 --> 16:14.450
- And, Jack, you're...
- -I'm a technical engineer.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.010
She should come shopping
with us.

16:16.077 --> 16:17.821
A different department
than, uh, Dean and Ted.

16:17.845 --> 16:19.722
Yeah, technically a worse,
less important department.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.883
I haven't really gotten
to talk to frank very much.

16:21.949 --> 16:24.886
Frank doesn't have to talk
to you.

16:24.952 --> 16:25.963
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

16:25.987 --> 16:28.388
You have no idea
how extraordinary he is.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.158
Or what he can do.

16:30.224 --> 16:31.501
You're lucky to even know
who he is,

16:31.525 --> 16:33.127
let alone be standing
in his house.

16:33.194 --> 16:36.496
I'm just excited. I'm sorry.

16:37.198 --> 16:39.332
I was just excited. Okay.

16:41.202 --> 16:43.180
- Oh! Guys, guys, guys.
Go, go, go, go.
- Ooh, here we go.

16:43.204 --> 16:46.207
- This way?
- Yeah, you should go in front.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.349
Gather 'round, everyone.

16:58.652 --> 17:00.587
Now, usually,
we don't have the opportunity

17:00.654 --> 17:02.824
to welcome couples in our home.

17:02.890 --> 17:05.960
But on this occasion,
we just couldn't wait

17:06.027 --> 17:09.096
to celebrate
our newest residents.

17:09.163 --> 17:11.464
Bill, Violet...

17:12.166 --> 17:14.534
I am so happy for you,

17:14.601 --> 17:16.703
that you get to learn
from my husband...

17:17.571 --> 17:19.273
And join this mission

17:19.339 --> 17:21.408
and become a part
of this family.

17:23.343 --> 17:27.614
Frank has built something
truly special.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.419
What he's created out here,
it's...

17:32.485 --> 17:33.988
It's a different way.

17:35.089 --> 17:36.958
A better way.

17:37.024 --> 17:40.094
- And we only have each other...
- Why are we here?

17:42.696 --> 17:44.564
Let's go, right now.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.969
We shouldn't be here.

17:50.872 --> 17:54.275
What was that?

17:54.342 --> 17:55.775
Now, now.

18:00.214 --> 18:03.918
Margaret and Ted are
going through a difficult time.

18:06.153 --> 18:11.558
Margaret's question is right.
It is the good question to ask.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.962
Why the hell are we here?

18:17.999 --> 18:22.769
Why, when this landscape
can seem so...

18:22.837 --> 18:27.008
Barren, so hard, so dusty, so...

18:28.943 --> 18:30.477
Worthless?

18:32.479 --> 18:33.747
Why not run?

18:33.814 --> 18:35.782
Why not go back to safety,
status quo,

18:35.850 --> 18:38.718
where it's safe,
where we should be?

18:38.785 --> 18:44.457
No, I choose...
We choose to stand our ground.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.592
Right?

18:45.659 --> 18:49.997
To look harder, to dig deeper.

18:50.064 --> 18:54.268
To mine that pure,

18:54.335 --> 18:58.839
unbridled potential.

18:58.906 --> 19:05.212
That gem of limitless
and unimaginable value.

19:07.048 --> 19:10.851
It's just too easy to get
distracted by what seems.

19:12.186 --> 19:15.056
Much more difficult, "braver,"
I would say...

19:16.723 --> 19:19.626
To search for what could be.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.231
- Dean...
- Hm?

19:24.298 --> 19:28.102
What is the enemy of progress?

19:28.169 --> 19:30.770
- Chaos.
- Yes.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.977
Nasty word. Chaos.

19:37.411 --> 19:40.580
Merciless foe, that chaos.

19:41.715 --> 19:44.617
Energy unfocused,
innovation hindered,

19:44.684 --> 19:47.487
hope strangled,
greatness disguised.

19:47.554 --> 19:50.757
I see greatness
in each one of you.

19:50.825 --> 19:52.525
I know exactly who you are.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.264
- What are we doing?
- Changing the world.

19:57.331 --> 20:00.001
- What are we doing?
- Changing the world.

20:00.067 --> 20:02.169
That's right.

20:02.236 --> 20:05.106
I look around, I see
another reason why I'm here.

20:05.172 --> 20:09.576
Once unfamiliar faces,
strangers, one and all, now...

20:11.045 --> 20:12.645
One brave family.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.215
Men like Dr. Collins.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.549
One of our first, who built
this community with me.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.320
Thank you,
Dr. Collins for your vision.

20:19.387 --> 20:23.924
And adventurers like bill,
our newest intrepid explorer.

20:23.991 --> 20:26.193
This brave,
young Robinson crusoe,

20:26.260 --> 20:29.263
who's choosing to join us
on this adventure.

20:29.330 --> 20:31.698
Bill, thank you
for being our partner in this.

20:33.267 --> 20:37.104
And thank you, Violet,
for being his partner in this.

20:37.171 --> 20:39.073
He could not do this
without you.

20:40.508 --> 20:41.775
All of you wives...

20:43.477 --> 20:45.779
We men, we ask a lot.

20:45.846 --> 20:49.716
We ask for strength,
a shoulder to cry on...

20:49.783 --> 20:52.920
Food at home, a house cleaned,

20:52.987 --> 20:55.622
and discretion, above all else.
And that...

20:57.858 --> 20:59.559
That's very difficult.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.501
You are my rock.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.103
I would not be here without you.

21:10.471 --> 21:11.771
Thank you.

21:17.111 --> 21:20.647
You're all dismissed.

- Margaret.
- They're hiding me in here.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.210
Oh, give us a second, Alice.
She'll be fine.

21:49.844 --> 21:51.278
I'm not fine.

21:52.146 --> 21:53.547
Nothing is fine.

21:53.613 --> 21:57.284
- She just needs to sleep.
- I don't sleep.

21:57.351 --> 21:59.286
I have bad dreams.

What are you doing?

22:22.910 --> 22:25.179
I wonder why I chose this tie.

22:36.323 --> 22:37.958
I like your ties.

22:56.177 --> 22:57.710
No.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.779
There are so many
people outside.

22:59.847 --> 23:01.781
Jack, there are so many people.

23:01.849 --> 23:04.251
There are so many
people outside.

23:58.973 --> 24:02.742
Wow him in a doubles game.
He'll 40-love this look.

24:02.810 --> 24:04.078
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

24:04.144 --> 24:05.778
Can you charge that
to Dean's account?

24:05.846 --> 24:08.315
I still can't believe
we can just charge, everywhere.

24:08.382 --> 24:10.017
Yes, but victory has things

24:10.084 --> 24:11.585
- money can't buy.
- Mm-hm.

24:11.652 --> 24:13.063
It's true, you don't have to
worry about the weather

24:13.087 --> 24:14.521
or learning to drive. Ugh.

24:14.588 --> 24:16.023
- I love driving.
- No.

24:16.090 --> 24:17.825
You love Jack
teaching you to drive.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.526
That's foreplay.

24:19.593 --> 24:22.563
Circle back to the guest list.
Were Kathy and Bob at frank's?

24:22.630 --> 24:24.198
- I think so.
- Really?

24:24.265 --> 24:26.233
Wow, so it just seems
very random, right?

24:26.300 --> 24:28.502
Who is invited and who isn't.

24:28.569 --> 24:30.904
It has nothing to do
with seniority, or success,

24:30.971 --> 24:32.473
or even being well-liked, right?

24:32.539 --> 24:35.876
Splish-splash. Who's ready
to dive into summer?

24:35.943 --> 24:37.544
- Charge that.
- Hideous.

24:39.013 --> 24:41.048
- I heard Margaret made a scene.
- Oh, my god.

24:41.115 --> 24:42.359
Threw a drink in someone's face?

24:42.383 --> 24:44.752
What? No.
That did not happen.

24:44.818 --> 24:46.520
She was upset.

24:46.587 --> 24:49.156
It was humiliating,
and she's gonna get Ted fired.

24:49.223 --> 24:50.557
Oh.

24:50.624 --> 24:52.293
If Peter got fired...

24:52.359 --> 24:53.360
I'd kill myself.

24:53.427 --> 24:54.995
Not kidding.
Can't live anywhere else.

24:55.062 --> 24:57.765
Margaret is just having
a really hard time.

24:57.831 --> 24:59.466
Whose fault is that?

25:02.303 --> 25:04.338
I know.
I still feel bad for her.

25:04.405 --> 25:06.674
Of course.
It was a terrible accident.

25:06.740 --> 25:07.775
It wasn't an accident.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.576
Bunny, stop. Come on.

25:09.643 --> 25:11.588
I don't want to be rude. I know
that she was your friend.

25:11.612 --> 25:13.881
She was our friend,
when she was normal.

25:13.947 --> 25:16.717
And then she lost her mind.

25:16.784 --> 25:20.120
She took her son
out into that desert.

25:20.187 --> 25:24.391
- She thought she saw something.
- She hallucinated.

25:24.458 --> 25:30.264
<i>Well, it wasn't exactly
clear as to what... happened.</i>

25:30.331 --> 25:33.701
<i>She knew how dangerous
it was, just like we all do.</i>

25:33.767 --> 25:36.603
The one thing
they ask of us is to stay here,

25:36.670 --> 25:39.206
where it's safe.

25:39.273 --> 25:41.975
But still, she dragged that
little boy out into the middle

25:42.042 --> 25:45.479
of god-knows-what.

25:45.546 --> 25:47.247
<i>If they don't want us
going out there,</i>

25:47.314 --> 25:49.650
<i>they have their reasons.</i>

25:49.717 --> 25:51.218
<i>So when they found her...</i>

25:51.285 --> 25:52.152
<i>She was alone.</i>

25:52.219 --> 25:53.887
They never found him.

25:54.855 --> 25:56.557
Oh.

25:56.623 --> 25:57.491
I knew he died, I...

25:57.558 --> 25:59.026
I just hadn't realized...

25:59.093 --> 26:02.229
She claims
they took him to punish her.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.372
Boys and their toys.

26:11.438 --> 26:14.208
Least we know they're
getting work done.

26:14.274 --> 26:17.211
What do you think
they're really doing out there?

26:20.481 --> 26:23.150
- What do you mean?
- I mean,
I know what they say...

26:23.217 --> 26:26.019
You know, "development
of progressive materials,"

26:26.086 --> 26:29.089
but, sometimes Peter insinuates

26:29.156 --> 26:31.392
that they're
actually making weapons.

26:31.458 --> 26:33.494
And that it's all
happening underground,

26:33.560 --> 26:35.295
- because frank discovered...
- Peg.

26:38.799 --> 26:40.067
Sorry.

26:41.502 --> 26:44.271
We're all here because
we believe in the mission.

26:44.338 --> 26:45.773
Yes.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.942
We have jobs too, that are just
as important, just as vital.

26:49.009 --> 26:50.879
What we do at home,
supporting them,

26:50.944 --> 26:52.579
taking care of them.

26:52.646 --> 26:54.758
Without that, they couldn't be
out there changing the world.

26:54.782 --> 26:56.250
Mm.

27:16.905 --> 27:19.373
<i>Everyone
focuses on the sacrifices</i>

27:19.440 --> 27:22.176
<i>you make by going
after what you want.</i>

27:22.242 --> 27:24.945
<i>I want you to focus
on the sacrifices you make</i>

27:25.012 --> 27:26.947
<i>by standing still.</i>

27:27.014 --> 27:31.251
<i>By not going
after what you know
you are owed by giving up,</i>

27:31.318 --> 27:33.153
<i>and taking the smaller version
of your life.</i>

27:33.220 --> 27:35.322
<i>Sacrifice doesn't just
take courage,</i>

27:35.389 --> 27:37.157
<i>it takes faith, saying,</i>

27:37.224 --> 27:40.661
<i>"I will stand this pain,
this hurt, this effort,</i>

27:40.727 --> 27:44.097
<i>knowing that what I want
is waiting on the other side."</i>

27:45.766 --> 27:49.503
<i>It's scary
to sacrifice something.</i>

27:49.570 --> 27:52.807
<i>But you're sacrificing
something more</i>

27:52.874 --> 27:54.675
<i>by sitting in that fear.</i>

28:25.706 --> 28:27.774
Oh, I said,
no shopping today, huh?

28:27.842 --> 28:30.344
Oh, no. No.

28:30.410 --> 28:31.889
Afraid that's
the end of the line for me,

28:31.913 --> 28:34.214
I'm just gonna need
to loop around back to town.

28:34.281 --> 28:37.251
That's fine, i'm...
I'm just here for the joyride.

28:37.317 --> 28:39.152
I needed to get
out of the house.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.357
Get some fresh air.

29:14.354 --> 29:18.759
Sir? Do you... do you see that?

29:18.826 --> 29:20.828
You all right, miss?

29:20.895 --> 29:23.330
Yeah. Do you see that plane?

29:23.397 --> 29:25.341
Uh, I'm afraid I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

29:25.365 --> 29:27.501
There's a plane, right...

29:28.970 --> 29:29.971
Oh, no!

29:30.038 --> 29:32.306
Oh, my god! Stop! Stop! Stop!

29:33.273 --> 29:35.776
That plane! It just crashed!

29:35.843 --> 29:37.144
Are you sure?

29:37.210 --> 29:38.856
Yes! Yes! You...
You need to drive out there.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.657
It just crashed. I...
I can show you where it is.

29:40.681 --> 29:43.985
Drive? No, uh...
I don't go that way.

29:44.052 --> 29:44.919
What?

29:44.986 --> 29:46.186
I don't go that way.

29:46.253 --> 29:49.089
We need to stay here,
where it's safe.

29:52.092 --> 29:55.063
But I...
I can't go out there alone.

29:55.128 --> 29:58.066
That's not my route. I can't.

29:58.131 --> 29:59.733
But what if they need help?

30:00.534 --> 30:01.534
Hey!

30:03.905 --> 30:05.739
Oh, my god.

30:05.807 --> 30:08.442
Oh, my god.
What's wrong with you?

31:36.763 --> 31:38.298
Hello?

31:40.868 --> 31:44.105
I need some help.
There's been an accident.

31:44.172 --> 31:46.306
A plane went down...

32:11.032 --> 32:12.733

35:54.889 --> 35:58.525
- Jack?
- You're awake.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.660
I didn't even have time
to set the table.

36:02.396 --> 36:04.564
What's going on?

36:04.631 --> 36:06.133
Well, I'm making you dinner.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.803
Now, we were supposed
to have five courses.

36:08.869 --> 36:12.306
Unfortunately, I think we're
down to about three.

36:12.373 --> 36:13.975
That... don't look at that.

36:14.041 --> 36:18.079
That course is officially
off the menu.

36:18.145 --> 36:19.679
What happened?

36:19.746 --> 36:22.515
I got a little aggressive
with the seasoning.

36:22.582 --> 36:24.651
How long have you been home?

36:24.718 --> 36:27.254
Uh, a few hours.

36:27.321 --> 36:29.023
Okay.

36:29.090 --> 36:31.325
Nope, don't look at that.
That's...

36:31.392 --> 36:33.060
Okay, so I'm making that roast.

36:33.127 --> 36:35.062
You know, the one you made
for my birthday?

36:35.129 --> 36:38.698
Only with a few changes.

36:39.666 --> 36:41.869
I was here when you got here?

36:41.936 --> 36:43.971
Yeah. Asleep in the bedroom.

36:44.038 --> 36:47.074
Do you put carrots in a roast?

36:48.442 --> 36:50.144
How did I get home?

36:50.211 --> 36:51.711
Trolley, I think.

36:54.547 --> 36:56.516
Wait, so he came out and got me?

36:56.583 --> 36:58.651
What are you talking about?

36:58.718 --> 37:02.456
Jack, I got off the trolley.
I saw a plane crash.

37:02.522 --> 37:04.859
Alice, I think I would've heard
if there was a plane crash.

37:04.925 --> 37:07.070
- No, Jack, I saw it...
- They tend to be rather loud...

37:07.094 --> 37:10.630
- And I started walking and...
- And hard to miss.

37:17.537 --> 37:20.241
Hey. Are you okay?

37:20.307 --> 37:23.210
- No, I don't know. I'm not...
- What's wrong?

37:23.277 --> 37:29.183
I had a really weird dream.
A really weird dream.

37:30.051 --> 37:32.153
I'm sorry.

37:32.219 --> 37:34.155
Do you know what
weird dreams make me?

37:34.221 --> 37:35.956
What?

37:36.023 --> 37:37.324
Hungry.

37:38.658 --> 37:41.095
- Would you like some carrot?
- Yes.

37:45.966 --> 37:48.135
Alice, I want to be honest
with you about something.

37:48.202 --> 37:49.702
Mm-hm?

37:51.105 --> 37:53.606
I don't think these mashed
potatoes are gonna work.

37:54.909 --> 37:57.677
That's because you need
to boil them first, baby.

37:57.744 --> 37:59.213
I knew it.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.714
I knew there was
a step missing.
Such an idiot.

38:01.781 --> 38:03.050
Let me put a pot on.

38:03.117 --> 38:04.819
No, no, no.

38:04.885 --> 38:06.463
-Come on, let me just put the...
-Make us some drinks.
Relax. Relax.

38:06.487 --> 38:07.388
- Okay. Okay.
- Make some drinks.

38:07.455 --> 38:09.890
I am your chef tonight!

38:14.862 --> 38:16.864
- Hey.
- Hm?

38:17.431 --> 38:18.833
You love me?

38:20.234 --> 38:21.601

Margaret!

43:13.627 --> 43:15.162
Jack, you don't understand.

43:15.229 --> 43:16.697
I was right there.

43:16.764 --> 43:18.575
- I watched the whole thing.
- I'm tired, Alice.

43:18.599 --> 43:20.467
<i>- I saw her fall.
- I want to go to bed.</i>

43:20.534 --> 43:22.903
I tried to go and help,
and then they dragged me away.

43:22.970 --> 43:24.371
Why would they take me away?

43:24.438 --> 43:26.306
- You have to stop!
- They...

43:26.373 --> 43:28.642
There is no way

43:28.709 --> 43:30.010
No.

43:31.445 --> 43:33.580
I don't know what to tell you.

43:33.647 --> 43:35.817
Ted is with her
at the hospital right now.

43:35.884 --> 43:37.785
- He said she needs
a few stitches.
- Mm-mm.

43:37.852 --> 43:40.921
She slipped cleaning
the window. It was an accident.

43:40.988 --> 43:43.123
Nope. I saw her.
She cut herself.

43:43.190 --> 43:44.425
You had a bad night.

43:44.491 --> 43:46.593
- Don't! No!
- You weren't feeling well.

43:46.660 --> 43:48.571
- She fell, and you imagined
the worst case scenario.
- No, don't do that.

43:48.595 --> 43:51.098
- She slit her throat!
- That's crazy.

43:51.165 --> 43:52.533
Crazy. It's crazy.

43:52.599 --> 43:54.535
Jack, I saw it happen.
She cut herself open.

43:54.601 --> 43:56.937
There was blood everywhere.
It's not just a few stitches.

43:57.004 --> 43:59.973
Please don't get hysterical.

44:07.347 --> 44:08.582
Jack...

44:11.618 --> 44:13.120
She was my friend.

44:14.688 --> 44:16.423
And she came to me for help.

44:17.991 --> 44:19.493
And I ignored her.

44:21.061 --> 44:23.163
And then this happened.

44:23.230 --> 44:25.199
And I feel like it's my fault.

44:27.836 --> 44:30.237
It's no one's fault, Alice.
It was an accident.

44:30.304 --> 44:31.304
No.

44:33.140 --> 44:34.909
She said they would
come after her

44:34.975 --> 44:37.010
because she knew something.

44:39.613 --> 44:41.682
Why are they lying
about what happened?

44:41.748 --> 44:44.518
- Please, just stop.
- What are they hiding?

44:46.720 --> 44:49.056
Come on, baby, you have to
admit this is weird.

44:49.122 --> 44:51.191
- Stop!
- There's something off!

45:03.136 --> 45:05.439
What are you doing
at the victory project?

45:06.808 --> 45:09.676
You know what I do, Alice.
I'm a technical engineer.

45:10.845 --> 45:12.112
Mm-hm.

45:12.914 --> 45:14.181
I know.

45:16.383 --> 45:18.151
But what are they doing?

45:23.123 --> 45:24.625
Please...

45:26.059 --> 45:27.361
What's actually happening?

45:28.128 --> 45:29.396
Don't ask me that.

45:29.463 --> 45:31.966
The development
of progressive materials?

45:32.032 --> 45:33.978
- What does that even mean?
- You know we can't
talk about this.

45:34.002 --> 45:35.245
- What does that even mean?
- You know we can't
talk about this.

45:35.269 --> 45:36.637
Come on, what does it mean?

45:36.703 --> 45:38.772
What does it even mean?
Do you know?

45:38.840 --> 45:40.808
Do you even know
what frank is actually doing?

45:40.875 --> 45:42.209
It's classified.

45:42.276 --> 45:43.586
We're not even allowed
to discuss our jobs

45:43.610 --> 45:45.279
with other departments,
you know that.

45:45.345 --> 45:46.780
What if Margaret was right?

45:46.848 --> 45:48.016
Stop it, Alice.

45:48.081 --> 45:48.983
What if this place is dangerous?

45:49.049 --> 45:50.217
- What if...
- Stop it!

45:52.519 --> 45:54.688
I'm part of
something important, Alice.

45:55.957 --> 45:58.592
This mission,
what frank's doing, it matters.

45:58.659 --> 46:00.203
I know that, baby,
but you're not listening to me.

46:00.227 --> 46:03.664
No! Not everyone
gets this opportunity.

46:03.730 --> 46:05.232
And if you keep
talking like this,

46:05.299 --> 46:06.968
you're gonna put it all at risk.

46:07.035 --> 46:08.635
You're worried about a demotion?

46:08.702 --> 46:09.982
That's what you're
worried about?

46:10.038 --> 46:11.104
Our life...

46:12.105 --> 46:14.207
Alice. Our life together.

46:15.142 --> 46:16.310
This.

46:17.077 --> 46:18.211
We could lose this.

46:21.015 --> 46:22.182
Please.

46:23.483 --> 46:24.819
Just get a hold of yourself.

46:27.554 --> 46:28.554
Please.

46:29.456 --> 46:31.525
Fuck's sake.

46:47.374 --> 46:50.544
<i>Victory is safe and secure.</i>

46:50.611 --> 46:53.047
<i>A perfect place
to raise the family</i>

46:53.113 --> 46:54.481
<i>you've always wanted,</i>

46:54.548 --> 46:56.483
<i>when you're not relaxing
with friends</i>

46:56.550 --> 46:59.419
<i>or enjoying
the breathtaking scenery</i>

46:59.486 --> 47:02.023
<i>of this sunbaked paradise.</i>

47:02.090 --> 47:04.424
<i>Although, you might find
the best scenery</i>

47:04.491 --> 47:06.326
<i>at the club pool.</i>

47:06.393 --> 47:09.296
<i>Here you can live the life
you deserve.</i>

47:09.363 --> 47:11.798
<i>We can all live the life...</i>

47:55.843 --> 47:57.544
<i>If I could tell frank anything,</i>

47:57.611 --> 48:00.480
<i>it would just be, "thank you."
Because I didn't know</i>

48:00.547 --> 48:02.382
<i>I could be this happy.</i>

48:02.449 --> 48:06.720
<i>Honestly, I don't even remember
my life before victory.</i>

48:06.787 --> 48:11.324
<i>Frank gave us the opportunity
of a lifetime. I wouldn't...</i>

48:55.036 --> 48:57.839
<i>We are so lucky to be here.</i>

49:10.118 --> 49:12.552
Hm.

49:12.619 --> 49:15.655
- Is there a bug going around?
- No, not that I know of.

49:17.125 --> 49:20.962
Think this is just
run-of-the-mill exhaustion.

49:21.028 --> 49:23.965
You had any new stresses
or pressures lately?

49:24.031 --> 49:27.168
- Um...
- -She saw Ted's wife fall.

49:27.235 --> 49:28.702
Thought maybe it might be shock.

49:28.769 --> 49:31.005
Boy, that was quite a tumble.

49:31.072 --> 49:32.506
She was so embarrassed.

49:34.407 --> 49:36.510
It... it wasn't a tumble.

49:38.411 --> 49:39.713
She slit her throat.

49:39.780 --> 49:42.382
- Alice.
- Uh, no, no, no.

49:45.253 --> 49:48.990
Witnessing a trauma can often
lead to distorted memories.

49:49.056 --> 49:50.390
Even nightmares.

49:52.093 --> 49:53.460
It's...

49:53.527 --> 49:55.629
I have some pills
I can prescribe for that.

49:55.695 --> 49:59.934
Uh, I... I really don't think
that I need those.

50:00.767 --> 50:02.769
Oh, they're precautionary.

50:03.737 --> 50:04.906
Most of my patients have had

50:04.972 --> 50:07.842
quite a bit of success
with them.

50:07.909 --> 50:10.710
They will just keep you relaxed.

50:15.615 --> 50:16.750
She doesn't need those.

50:18.652 --> 50:20.520
This isn't a problem.

50:20.587 --> 50:22.857
We can handle it ourselves.

50:24.959 --> 50:27.028
Well, I'll just
keep that on file.

50:33.366 --> 50:36.670
What did you do to Margaret?

50:37.771 --> 50:38.906
Pardon?

50:40.041 --> 50:41.041
Ted's wife.

50:45.179 --> 50:47.547
I'm sorry, I'm just... I...

50:47.614 --> 50:51.986
I still don't understand
how she's okay.

50:54.487 --> 50:56.834
You wouldn't want me discussing
the details of your treatment

50:56.858 --> 50:58.525
with my other patients, now,
would you?

50:58.592 --> 51:02.296
Mm... I wouldn't mind.

51:02.362 --> 51:05.099
I would just... I would really
love to know the details of...

51:05.166 --> 51:07.634
Of how you fixed her.

51:10.071 --> 51:12.405
Well, as you know, we provide
both psychiatric

51:12.472 --> 51:14.441
and physical care here.

51:14.507 --> 51:17.544
And Margaret was
in need of both.

51:17.611 --> 51:19.814
The good news is,
is that physically, she's fine,

51:19.881 --> 51:22.316
but psychologically, she wasn't.

51:22.382 --> 51:24.085
She was having
significant troubles.

51:24.151 --> 51:26.888
Outbursts. Paranoia.

51:26.954 --> 51:29.656
She made it impossible
for Ted to do his job,

51:29.723 --> 51:33.127
so he no longer works
for the victory project.

51:33.194 --> 51:35.662
She needed quite a bit of help.

51:35.729 --> 51:37.899
Ah... not like you.

51:39.766 --> 51:41.135
No.

51:41.202 --> 51:43.436
It's not necessary here.

51:43.503 --> 51:45.639
It's a totally
different scenario.

51:46.841 --> 51:49.076
What is it that you brits say?

51:51.645 --> 51:54.315
Ah! "Keep calm and carry on."

51:59.419 --> 52:01.822
Jack.
Walk me out?

52:01.889 --> 52:04.325
Of course.

52:04.392 --> 52:06.160
And remember...

52:06.227 --> 52:08.528
- That I'm always
a phone call away.
- Oh, thank you.

52:08.595 --> 52:09.796
Thank you so much.

52:35.389 --> 52:36.456
Oh, come on.

52:44.332 --> 52:46.566
You know our position on that.

52:46.633 --> 52:48.803
So glad you came back.
You left this.

52:48.869 --> 52:50.549
I'd forget my head
if it wasn't screwed on.

52:52.306 --> 52:54.708
Jack, shouldn't you be getting
back to work?

52:54.774 --> 52:56.576
Yeah. Of course.

53:00.780 --> 53:02.283
- See you tonight.
- Mm-hm.

53:02.350 --> 53:03.350
Okay.

53:42.555 --> 53:46.127
Oh, no. No. It's not...

55:43.676 --> 55:47.747
<i>♪ I used to
play around with hearts... ♪</i>

55:47.815 --> 55:49.617
Might ask shelley

55:49.682 --> 55:52.186
if it feels like a good time.

55:52.253 --> 55:54.922
You're still in the bath?
We're gonna be late.

55:56.157 --> 55:57.925
You see the dress I got you?

55:58.893 --> 56:01.262
Picked it out last week.

56:01.328 --> 56:03.330
I couldn't stop
picturing you in it.

56:05.533 --> 56:07.268
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

56:08.668 --> 56:10.304
You look incredible.

56:12.540 --> 56:15.009
Been thinking we should
try something kind of crazy.

56:15.075 --> 56:17.912

56:29.423 --> 56:30.891
And I want more of you.

56:32.059 --> 56:34.128
And I think I want a little you.

56:40.167 --> 56:42.136
I don't know,
I think it would be fun.

56:43.571 --> 56:45.906
Just think about it, okay?

56:46.607 --> 56:47.808
Okay.

57:13.534 --> 57:16.203
Good evening.
We've been waiting for you.

57:16.270 --> 57:17.338
I'm so sorry.

57:17.404 --> 57:19.607
You have the best table
in the house.

57:27.014 --> 57:30.818
- Good to see you, man.
- Hey, guys.

57:30.884 --> 57:33.087
Why are you two
always fighting?
What's wrong with you?

57:33.153 --> 57:36.056
- Always. Constantly.
- We're fine.
We're fine.

57:36.123 --> 57:39.193
- Hi.
- Oh! Finally! Hi.

57:39.827 --> 57:42.496
Hello. Oh, my god!

57:44.431 --> 57:46.667
Here, drink this.

57:46.734 --> 57:48.014
You look just like
a little doll.

57:48.068 --> 57:49.670
Spin, spin, spin! Ah!

57:49.737 --> 57:53.107
This is me. This is you.
Here, go, go, go.

57:53.173 --> 57:55.109
- All the way back.
- Just drink it all!

57:55.175 --> 57:57.678
- There we go.
- There we go!

57:57.745 --> 57:59.580
Here are the troublemakers.

58:01.382 --> 58:03.093
I can't believe we're allowed
to put all of you at one table.

58:03.117 --> 58:04.794
I think it's better for
insurance purposes,

58:04.818 --> 58:06.453
- to be honest.
- That is true.

58:08.155 --> 58:11.058
Alice, how are you feeling?

58:11.125 --> 58:13.427
I'm... I'm well.
I'm doing well.

58:14.094 --> 58:15.195
This is beautiful.

58:15.262 --> 58:18.465
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

58:18.532 --> 58:20.644
And if I hear glass breaking,
I'm coming right back here.

58:20.668 --> 58:21.902
Oh, don't tempt us

58:21.969 --> 58:23.570
or we'll be breaking glass
all night.

58:29.109 --> 58:30.611
See you
on the dance floor later?

58:30.678 --> 58:32.346
Yes, ma'am. Of course.

58:36.583 --> 58:38.986
Can my
husband throw a party or what?

58:41.889 --> 58:45.225
He does so much for us.

58:45.292 --> 58:47.628
More than we could ever repay.

58:47.695 --> 58:50.764
But I have attempted
a little... gift for him.

58:50.831 --> 58:53.367
- Uh-oh.
- -For all of us, really.

58:53.434 --> 58:55.069
I hope you enjoy.

59:10.617 --> 59:12.219
Oh!

59:12.786 --> 59:14.321
Let's go!

59:53.761 --> 59:54.895
You went out there.

59:56.029 --> 59:57.097
You saw it.

1:00:03.704 --> 1:00:05.606
<i>She was having outbursts.</i>

1:00:06.940 --> 1:00:08.175
Paranoia.

1:00:18.919 --> 1:00:20.721
How 'bout that?

1:00:24.224 --> 1:00:27.127
There you are. I bow to you.

1:00:29.797 --> 1:00:31.799
Now, make some noise! Come on!

1:00:31.866 --> 1:00:34.601
You like that?

1:00:34.668 --> 1:00:36.370
Did you guys like that?

1:00:36.437 --> 1:00:39.473
Get off of your seats, come on!

1:00:39.540 --> 1:00:41.175
How are you, sweetheart?
Good to see you.

1:00:41.241 --> 1:00:43.277
All right, this is what
I'm talking about.

1:00:43.343 --> 1:00:45.679
You work hard, you play hard.

1:00:45.746 --> 1:00:47.214
What do you say, Jacko?

1:00:49.918 --> 1:00:51.718
- Jack, I want to go home.
- What?

1:00:51.785 --> 1:00:53.020
I want to go.

1:00:53.086 --> 1:00:54.955
Come on, Tim!
Come on, Tim!

1:00:55.022 --> 1:00:57.224
All right!

1:00:57.291 --> 1:01:00.027
Whoo!

1:01:00.093 --> 1:01:02.229
How about that?
Put your hands together.

1:01:02.296 --> 1:01:03.530
Please, we need to leave.

1:01:03.597 --> 1:01:05.165
We need to leave right now.
Please.

1:01:05.232 --> 1:01:06.376
- We'll just pour you a drink.
- Please.

1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:07.668
- No.
- You'll be okay.

1:01:07.734 --> 1:01:10.771
Only the best for victory.
My goodness!

1:01:10.839 --> 1:01:12.973
All right, take a seat.

1:01:17.978 --> 1:01:21.014
Uh, I have the burden
now of trying to follow that,

1:01:21.081 --> 1:01:23.450
which will be hard, but...

1:01:23.517 --> 1:01:26.520
- Jack...
- I have to admit that I, uh...

1:01:28.188 --> 1:01:30.524
I was planning...

1:01:30.591 --> 1:01:32.693
A little presentation of my own.

1:01:32.759 --> 1:01:36.563
I know.

1:01:36.630 --> 1:01:40.869
I know. Yeah.
All right. All right.

1:01:42.904 --> 1:01:44.171
Jack chambers.

1:01:46.106 --> 1:01:48.475
If I could have you up here
for a minute.

1:01:50.945 --> 1:01:52.412
Jack.

1:01:52.479 --> 1:01:54.916
Jack, please, I need to
go home. We need to leave.

1:01:54.983 --> 1:01:57.518
Come on, everybody,
give him a round of applause.

1:01:57.584 --> 1:01:59.186
Needs a little encouragement.

1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:01.622
Big round of applause.

1:02:01.688 --> 1:02:04.458
Let's give him
a big victory welcome!

1:02:06.727 --> 1:02:08.328
Jack chambers.

1:02:16.470 --> 1:02:20.507
Tonight is my favorite night
of the year.

1:02:20.574 --> 1:02:23.176
I love seeing everybody
under one roof,

1:02:23.243 --> 1:02:25.779
seeing how much we've all grown.

1:02:28.016 --> 1:02:29.550
But few...

1:02:30.717 --> 1:02:32.719
Few have grown as...

1:02:34.054 --> 1:02:36.490
Impressively...

1:02:36.557 --> 1:02:38.325
As this young man right here.

1:02:42.897 --> 1:02:46.433
I've debated long and hard
about this, lord knows. Whew!

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:50.637
It's certainly
out of the ordinary.

1:02:50.704 --> 1:02:54.408
But you know what? This man
is out of the ordinary.

1:02:54.474 --> 1:02:58.111
This man, I am in awe of.

1:03:00.213 --> 1:03:02.749
Jack chambers, I am honored...

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:08.355
To invite you to join our...

1:03:10.290 --> 1:03:11.926
Senior advisory board.

1:03:28.775 --> 1:03:30.711
Are you the man
that you say you are?

1:03:41.321 --> 1:03:42.356
It's a good fit.

1:03:45.492 --> 1:03:47.361
Thank you for your loyalty.

1:03:48.997 --> 1:03:50.564
More good things to come.

1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:55.202
How 'bout that,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:04:32.006 --> 1:04:33.841
You wanna see the boy dance?

1:04:37.511 --> 1:04:40.180
Look at this boy dance!

1:04:41.314 --> 1:04:44.819
Come on! Come on!

1:04:48.555 --> 1:04:50.858
Look what he can do!

1:04:57.131 --> 1:05:00.068
<i>- Don't say that.
You're gonna get another job.
- Alice!</i>

1:05:01.368 --> 1:05:04.806
Hey. What's wrong? Honey.

1:05:06.074 --> 1:05:08.843
What happened? What's wrong?

1:05:10.444 --> 1:05:11.913
It's extraordinary!

1:05:18.986 --> 1:05:21.022
Everything's fine. It's okay.

1:05:21.089 --> 1:05:22.355
Bunny, we need to go.

1:05:22.422 --> 1:05:23.766
We need to get out of here
right now.

1:05:23.790 --> 1:05:26.293
- No, no, no. We're okay.
- We need to go.

1:05:26.359 --> 1:05:29.964
We're okay. Come on.
Tell me, what happened?

1:05:33.101 --> 1:05:35.268
How about that, huh?

1:05:36.104 --> 1:05:37.404
You watching him dance?

1:05:37.471 --> 1:05:39.339
Margaret was right.

1:05:40.875 --> 1:05:44.478
She was asking questions
that they don't want us to ask.

1:05:44.544 --> 1:05:47.547
And so they silenced her.

1:05:47.614 --> 1:05:49.483
She didn't slip.
It wasn't an accident.

1:05:49.549 --> 1:05:52.352
I saw it happen.
I saw her fall.

1:05:52.419 --> 1:05:54.588
They're lying about everything.

1:05:58.126 --> 1:05:59.693
Dance, Jack!

1:06:02.529 --> 1:06:04.899
Let's make him spin, shall we?

1:06:04.966 --> 1:06:07.467
And so I went out there,
and I saw it.

1:06:07.534 --> 1:06:09.603
You went... you went out where?

1:06:09.669 --> 1:06:13.306
Yeah, that's it!
Come on, boy, faster!

1:06:13.373 --> 1:06:16.043
Keep it going! Come on!
Come on! Yeah!

1:06:18.345 --> 1:06:19.780
That's it!

1:06:20.948 --> 1:06:23.985
Ha-ha!

1:06:24.051 --> 1:06:26.653
Doesn't that make you believe?

1:06:27.989 --> 1:06:29.857
Stand up!

1:06:29.924 --> 1:06:33.861
Stand up, take a bow!
Take a bow, you deserve it!

1:06:33.928 --> 1:06:37.064
And when I touched it,
I saw something.

1:06:38.065 --> 1:06:40.667
And I keep remembering more.

1:06:40.734 --> 1:06:43.537
And I heard frank's voice,
and he's in my head...

1:06:43.603 --> 1:06:45.873
It's more than just
a celebration

1:06:45.940 --> 1:06:50.777
of our freedom from society's
arbitrary regulations,

1:06:50.845 --> 1:06:56.017
it's a celebration
of potential unleashed!

1:06:56.083 --> 1:06:58.920
It's a reminder of who we are!

1:06:58.986 --> 1:07:01.388
Can I just show you?
Let's just go out there.

1:07:01.454 --> 1:07:02.632
Everybody will be
distracted right now.

1:07:02.656 --> 1:07:03.891
We can take Dean's car.

1:07:03.958 --> 1:07:05.625
- We can head to...
- Stop. Stop. Stop it!

1:07:07.228 --> 1:07:09.563
- Have you lost your mind?
- What?

1:07:09.629 --> 1:07:11.331
You went to headquarters?

1:07:11.398 --> 1:07:13.878
- Because I thought I saw
a plane crash.
- It is the one rule...

1:07:13.935 --> 1:07:15.478
- No, I know...
- They ask us to respect.

1:07:15.502 --> 1:07:17.271
You know how dangerous it is.

1:07:17.337 --> 1:07:19.439
We are not going backwards.

1:07:19.506 --> 1:07:21.943
We're pushing forwards, yes?

1:07:22.776 --> 1:07:24.278
We move!

1:07:24.344 --> 1:07:27.380
- You stole from Dr. Collins?
- Because Margaret
can't be okay!

1:07:27.447 --> 1:07:30.084
Get a hold of yourself, Alice!

1:07:30.151 --> 1:07:32.485
You are behaving like a child.

1:07:32.552 --> 1:07:34.021
Your husband is out there

1:07:34.088 --> 1:07:36.690
having the most important night
of his life.

1:07:36.756 --> 1:07:37.992
He's being celebrated,

1:07:38.059 --> 1:07:38.993
and you're in here
trying to ruin it?

1:07:39.060 --> 1:07:40.328
No! No!

1:07:40.393 --> 1:07:43.064
You sound exactly like Margaret!

1:07:47.268 --> 1:07:49.036
Whose world is it?

1:07:49.103 --> 1:07:50.338
Ours!

1:07:50.403 --> 1:07:52.439
Whose world is this?

1:07:52.505 --> 1:07:53.841
Ours!

1:07:53.908 --> 1:07:55.508
- Whose world is this?
- Ours!

1:07:55.575 --> 1:07:56.476
Whose world is this?

1:07:56.543 --> 1:07:57.744
Ours!

1:08:03.117 --> 1:08:05.485
- Whose world is it? Ours!
- Ours!

1:08:05.552 --> 1:08:07.989
- Whose world is it? Ours!
- Ours!

1:08:08.055 --> 1:08:09.489
Whose world is it?

1:08:09.556 --> 1:08:11.058
- Ours!
- Ours!

1:08:11.125 --> 1:08:12.860
- Whose world is it?
Ours!
- Ours!

1:08:12.927 --> 1:08:15.495
- Whose world is it?
Ours!
- Ours!

1:08:26.207 --> 1:08:28.242
They're calling it
operation extract.

1:08:28.309 --> 1:08:30.477
It's higher security clearance.

1:08:30.543 --> 1:08:32.412
I'm gonna be heading
the whole thing myself,

1:08:32.479 --> 1:08:35.116
which is a real vote of
confidence from frank, I think.

1:08:36.650 --> 1:08:39.186
<i>♪ See the pyramids ♪</i>

1:08:39.253 --> 1:08:42.722
<i>♪ along the nile ♪</i>

1:08:48.795 --> 1:08:50.831
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

1:08:50.898 --> 1:08:51.999
There he is.

1:08:52.066 --> 1:08:55.568
Oh, my. Those are beautiful.
Come on in.

1:08:55.635 --> 1:08:56.804
Come on in.

1:08:56.871 --> 1:08:58.205
I want it for you.
Thank you.

1:08:58.272 --> 1:08:59.941
Are we late?
I feel like we're late.

1:09:00.007 --> 1:09:01.417
We literally
are arriving at the same time.

1:09:01.441 --> 1:09:02.709
What are
these platters? Wow!

1:09:02.776 --> 1:09:04.544
Whatever's going on here,
I love. I love.

1:09:04.611 --> 1:09:06.047
You like it?

1:09:06.113 --> 1:09:07.523
- Yeah, the decor is...
- I'm glad, bill. I'm glad.

1:09:07.547 --> 1:09:08.382
All right, buddy,
tell me the truth.

1:09:08.448 --> 1:09:09.616
Is he really coming?

1:09:09.683 --> 1:09:11.185
This is for you.
I think he's coming.

1:09:11.252 --> 1:09:12.461
How the hell did you get frank
to come to your house?

1:09:12.485 --> 1:09:14.055
It wasn't me. It was Alice.

1:09:14.121 --> 1:09:15.799
These are the perks. I get it.
This is how you're living.

1:09:15.823 --> 1:09:17.663
Is everything in this house
from the catalogue?

1:09:17.724 --> 1:09:19.693
It's a house. Show me the ring.
Let me see it.

1:09:19.759 --> 1:09:21.228
Did we beat bunny?

1:09:21.295 --> 1:09:23.864
Uh, she... she's not coming.

1:09:24.664 --> 1:09:26.901
- Hm.
- Told you.

1:09:26.968 --> 1:09:28.544
- Sorry, boys. Can I just get...
- Yeah, yeah.

1:09:28.568 --> 1:09:29.913
You know, it's a good thing
you can dance,

1:09:29.937 --> 1:09:31.415
'cause you're so hideously
unattractive.

1:09:31.439 --> 1:09:33.207
- They're here!
- How many secrets do you...

1:09:33.274 --> 1:09:34.674
Thank you.

1:09:34.741 --> 1:09:36.243
- It's good to see you.
- Wow.

1:09:36.310 --> 1:09:39.579
I knew it. I told peg.
It's gonna be a no-tie event.

1:09:39.646 --> 1:09:43.084
- Frank.
- Jack! You crazy
son of a bitch!

1:09:43.150 --> 1:09:44.550
What do you want me
to do with this?

1:09:44.584 --> 1:09:46.020
Hold on to it.

1:09:46.087 --> 1:09:47.697
I told her it was gonna be like
a casual thing.

1:09:47.721 --> 1:09:49.123
- Put that on ice.
- Wow.

1:09:49.190 --> 1:09:50.891
- Thanks for coming.
- I'm proud of you.

1:09:50.958 --> 1:09:52.302
- Thank you.
- What a lovely home,
by the way.

1:09:52.326 --> 1:09:54.095
Jack, could you make shelley
a cocktail?

1:09:54.161 --> 1:09:55.429
Of course.

1:09:55.495 --> 1:09:57.074
Hey, frank, that was
a hell of a party last night.

1:09:57.098 --> 1:09:58.265
It was.

1:09:58.332 --> 1:10:00.533
I'm trying to get my wife
into a Martini glass.

1:10:01.869 --> 1:10:03.570
- He liked that.
- No, he didn't.

1:10:03.636 --> 1:10:05.476
- Where's your drink?
- It's right here.
Cheers!

1:10:05.538 --> 1:10:07.707
Cheers.
It's a wonderful home.

1:10:07.774 --> 1:10:09.477
- How are you?
- Me?

1:10:09.542 --> 1:10:10.811
- I'm amazing.
- Mm-hm.

1:10:10.878 --> 1:10:12.712
After the night Jack had,
I'm incredible.

1:10:12.779 --> 1:10:13.848
Right. Of course.

1:10:13.914 --> 1:10:16.750
Cheers. Thanks for coming.

1:10:16.817 --> 1:10:18.785
- You were a triumph last night.
- Oh!

1:10:18.853 --> 1:10:20.163
We haven't stopped talking
about you.

1:10:20.187 --> 1:10:21.721
You guys go now
and enjoy yourselves.

1:10:21.788 --> 1:10:24.657
I'm gonna go back
to the plates and finish up,

1:10:24.724 --> 1:10:26.564
- and, um, I'll see you in...
- Can I help you?

1:10:26.626 --> 1:10:28.105
- No, no, no, no, go.
- You sure? Okay.

1:10:28.129 --> 1:10:29.562
Promise. Go snoop.

1:10:29.629 --> 1:10:30.931
I love this record player.

1:10:30.998 --> 1:10:32.442
- You do? You like it, bill?
- I love it.

1:10:32.466 --> 1:10:34.306
At my house, I have a bench.
How did you get...

1:10:36.837 --> 1:10:38.671
You can probably tell by now

1:10:38.738 --> 1:10:41.475
that appetizers are where
I really express myself

1:10:41.541 --> 1:10:43.411
and buck convention.

1:10:43.477 --> 1:10:44.744
It's a skill.

1:10:44.812 --> 1:10:46.447
Maybe you can teach me sometime.

1:10:46.514 --> 1:10:48.049
Can't be taught.

1:11:01.262 --> 1:11:03.297
I learned something
very exciting.

1:11:05.399 --> 1:11:06.801
Oh, really? What's that?

1:11:06.867 --> 1:11:09.303
Rumor is you and Jack
are trying.

1:11:09.370 --> 1:11:11.072
Oh, well...

1:11:11.138 --> 1:11:12.807
- We'll see.
- Mm.

1:11:13.673 --> 1:11:15.209
Hope we'll see a little boy.

1:11:20.780 --> 1:11:24.318
I'm sorry
bunny didn't believe you.

1:11:35.362 --> 1:11:37.998
But then again, you didn't
believe Margaret, so...

1:11:39.967 --> 1:11:41.869
Why should anyone believe you?

1:11:49.276 --> 1:11:51.312
My god, you fascinate me.

1:11:52.779 --> 1:11:54.647
Because I've been waiting
for someone like you.

1:11:54.714 --> 1:11:57.684
Someone to challenge me.

1:12:00.221 --> 1:12:02.189
No great man has changed
the course of history

1:12:02.256 --> 1:12:05.993
without being pushed
to the limits of his potential.

1:12:07.094 --> 1:12:08.329
And you push me.

1:12:10.498 --> 1:12:11.832
Yeah.

1:12:14.767 --> 1:12:16.837
I do hope you keep going.

1:12:28.449 --> 1:12:29.984
And yet, here you are.

1:12:31.751 --> 1:12:33.254
Preparing dinner.

1:12:35.755 --> 1:12:37.224
Like a good girl.

1:12:45.866 --> 1:12:47.168
- Sit.
- Absolutely.

1:12:47.234 --> 1:12:48.634
Do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

1:12:48.668 --> 1:12:50.905
No, I hope it's a boy.
Thank you.

1:12:50.971 --> 1:12:52.640
- Can't get enough
of 'em, right?

1:12:52.705 --> 1:12:54.341
Girls are hard. They are.

1:12:54.408 --> 1:12:56.709
- I'll be right there,
all right?
- Thank you.

1:12:58.379 --> 1:13:00.780
You know, Alice tells me you're
a hell of a tennis player.

1:13:00.848 --> 1:13:02.983
- Oh, she does?
- Is that right? Yeah.

1:13:03.050 --> 1:13:04.618
She's being polite.

1:13:04.684 --> 1:13:06.329
Well, we're looking
for some fierce competitors.

1:13:06.353 --> 1:13:08.098
If you're ever ready
to get out there, call me.

1:13:08.122 --> 1:13:09.933
I've heard about that backhand,
though, it's famous.

1:13:09.957 --> 1:13:11.825
If you want a partner,
I'm yours, man.

1:13:11.892 --> 1:13:13.726
That's a lot of pressure.
I don't know if...

1:13:13.793 --> 1:13:15.329
Thank you.

1:13:25.339 --> 1:13:27.659
I'm having the fish. I don't
know what you guys are having.

1:13:29.009 --> 1:13:30.444
Nice to see a familiar face.

1:13:30.511 --> 1:13:32.379
Um, so anyways,
those windows right there,

1:13:32.446 --> 1:13:33.814
the slatted windows?

1:13:33.881 --> 1:13:35.616
They're actually called
"jalousie" windows.

1:13:35.683 --> 1:13:36.917
Did you know that?

1:13:36.984 --> 1:13:38.352
- You didn't know why.
- Oh, boy.

1:13:38.419 --> 1:13:39.653
So, the etymology is...

1:13:39.719 --> 1:13:40.921
"Jealousy."

1:13:40.988 --> 1:13:42.199
And you say,
"whose baby is this?"

1:13:42.223 --> 1:13:43.591
And they say, "it's your baby."

1:13:43.657 --> 1:13:45.326
And you say,
"how could that be?"

1:13:45.392 --> 1:13:46.759
And it is your baby.

1:13:46.827 --> 1:13:49.129
And I just do it every year.

1:13:49.196 --> 1:13:52.333
Violet, where are you from?

1:13:52.399 --> 1:13:55.336
- Pardon?
- I said, "where are you from?"

1:13:56.670 --> 1:13:58.239
Philadelphia.

1:13:58.305 --> 1:14:00.274
- Mm! I'm from Philadelphia!
- Are you serious?

1:14:00.341 --> 1:14:02.042
- I didn't know that.
- I knew I liked you.

1:14:02.109 --> 1:14:04.178
Most of the women here
are from Philadelphia.

1:14:05.145 --> 1:14:07.514
Or Baltimore. Or Chicago.

1:14:07.581 --> 1:14:08.748
I've noticed.

1:14:08.816 --> 1:14:10.117
Mm. Can I
get anyone anything?

1:14:10.184 --> 1:14:11.428
I for one do not miss
the winters.

1:14:11.452 --> 1:14:13.153
No, no, no.
I thrive in the sunshine,

1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:14.655
even though
I'm alabaster-skinned.

1:14:14.722 --> 1:14:17.124
I love the sunshine.
I love the beach.

1:14:17.191 --> 1:14:18.758
- Mm.
- She does.

1:14:18.826 --> 1:14:20.294
What was the last beach
you went to?

1:14:20.361 --> 1:14:21.662
Oh, fun fact about the beach.

1:14:21.729 --> 1:14:23.130
- I read this.
- Yeah?

1:14:23.197 --> 1:14:24.608
Beaches are actually some
of the filthiest places

1:14:24.632 --> 1:14:26.333
in the whole world.

1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:28.102
- Just a sandbox
of disease and...
- Peter!

1:14:28.168 --> 1:14:29.479
Do not say "disease"
at the dinner table.

1:14:29.503 --> 1:14:31.071
It's true.
They need to know.

1:14:31.138 --> 1:14:34.508
I can probably guess.
Hilton head? Cape Cod?

1:14:34.575 --> 1:14:36.043
Or the Jersey shore?

1:14:38.512 --> 1:14:41.615
And we all honeymooned
in sea island,

1:14:41.682 --> 1:14:44.885
or the poconos,
or Niagara Falls.

1:14:48.255 --> 1:14:50.391
I think those are popular
honeymoon destinations.

1:14:50.457 --> 1:14:52.660
- Expensive.
- Mm-hm. Beautiful, beautiful.

1:14:52.726 --> 1:14:54.895
Peter, you, uh... you haven't
finished your story.

1:14:54.962 --> 1:14:56.664
Mm!
Bill over here's probably

1:14:56.730 --> 1:14:58.608
- one of the worst
golf players...
- I'm sorry, Peter.

1:14:58.632 --> 1:15:01.402
I'm not quite finished.
Violet, where did
you meet bill?

1:15:02.870 --> 1:15:04.672
Well, we met on a train.

1:15:04.738 --> 1:15:06.240
- To Boston.
- To Boston.

1:15:06.307 --> 1:15:07.775
Yeah.

1:15:07.841 --> 1:15:10.010
Yes.

1:15:10.077 --> 1:15:11.712
You dropped your ticket.

1:15:11.779 --> 1:15:14.915
And he bent down, picked it up,
gave it to you, right?

1:15:15.949 --> 1:15:17.217
It is, yeah.

1:15:18.218 --> 1:15:19.987
That's how Margaret met Ted.

1:15:21.622 --> 1:15:23.223
And peg, am I right in thinking

1:15:23.290 --> 1:15:25.726
that's how Debbie mcintyre
met her husband?

1:15:25.793 --> 1:15:27.961
Yes, I am. That's how they met.

1:15:28.028 --> 1:15:30.230
- Yes, that's true. I'm jealous.
- Is it?

1:15:30.297 --> 1:15:31.441
- Honestly, it's such a sweet story.
- -Wow.

1:15:31.465 --> 1:15:33.000
Yeah. Yeah.

1:15:33.067 --> 1:15:33.834
Isn't that funny,
the way those coincidences...

1:15:33.901 --> 1:15:35.536
Incredible.

1:15:35.602 --> 1:15:36.813
There are only so many
different stories we're told.

1:15:36.837 --> 1:15:39.306
We're told what we remember.

1:15:39.873 --> 1:15:41.909
Until...

1:15:41.975 --> 1:15:44.645
We try to remember things...

1:15:44.712 --> 1:15:47.381
That they want us to forget.

1:15:48.382 --> 1:15:49.917
- Like Margaret.
- Alice...

1:15:49.983 --> 1:15:53.220
No. Jack. It's okay.

1:15:55.155 --> 1:15:57.558
I'm curious to hear
where she's going with this.

1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:02.229
Frank is doing something to us.

1:16:10.137 --> 1:16:12.439
Delusions, memory problems,
hysteria.

1:16:12.506 --> 1:16:15.042
We saw these issues
with Margaret,

1:16:15.109 --> 1:16:17.277
and know that it's, uh,
completely curable.

1:16:17.344 --> 1:16:20.849
Dr. Collins prescribed you
a suite of medications,

1:16:20.914 --> 1:16:22.483
which you are
clearly not taking.

1:16:22.549 --> 1:16:23.550
The question is why...

1:16:23.617 --> 1:16:26.320
He's lying to us.
He's lying to all of us.

1:16:26.387 --> 1:16:29.690
Bunny, your best friend,
is worried about you.

1:16:29.757 --> 1:16:31.191
She thinks that you need help.

1:16:31.258 --> 1:16:32.726
Is that why she's
not here tonight?

1:16:32.793 --> 1:16:34.371
Because you didn't want
to be reminded of that.

1:16:34.395 --> 1:16:36.096
He's using you.
He's using all of us.

1:16:36.163 --> 1:16:38.108
Do you even know
what the victory project
actually is?

1:16:38.132 --> 1:16:41.268
- Have you ever asked?
- Do you?

1:16:41.335 --> 1:16:43.537
Is that why you went out there?

1:16:45.874 --> 1:16:47.908
To headquarters?

1:16:49.009 --> 1:16:50.911
What?

1:16:52.346 --> 1:16:53.914
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Alice...

1:16:53.981 --> 1:16:55.191
But you don't know
what he's doing.

1:16:55.215 --> 1:16:56.885
You wandered out by yourself.

1:16:56.950 --> 1:16:58.385
You ignored every rule.

1:16:58.452 --> 1:17:01.121
And she put all your lives
in danger.

1:17:05.926 --> 1:17:07.494
Yes, I did go out there

1:17:07.561 --> 1:17:09.339
and I went to headquarters
and I saw what he's hiding.

1:17:09.363 --> 1:17:10.964
- What I'm hiding.
- He's lying to us.

1:17:11.031 --> 1:17:12.566
- Oh, dear.
- -He's lying to all of us

1:17:12.633 --> 1:17:14.110
about what the victory project
actually is.

1:17:14.134 --> 1:17:14.903
- He's trapped us here.
- Alice...

1:17:14.968 --> 1:17:16.136
Trapped?

1:17:17.738 --> 1:17:20.607
I hope no one feels trapped.
Do you feel trapped?

1:17:20.674 --> 1:17:21.674
Violet?

1:17:23.277 --> 1:17:25.145
Peg?

1:17:26.915 --> 1:17:28.749
This is your psychosis.

1:17:28.817 --> 1:17:32.753
You are experiencing trust
as a feeling of entrapment,

1:17:32.821 --> 1:17:35.122
yet you trust every day.

1:17:35.857 --> 1:17:37.157
We all do.

1:17:37.224 --> 1:17:40.694
Tonight, you've trusted us
in your home.

1:17:43.197 --> 1:17:45.632
Just like I trusted you
in my bedroom.

1:17:54.641 --> 1:17:56.677
Alice?

1:17:56.743 --> 1:17:58.178
Do you remember that?

1:18:01.381 --> 1:18:04.051
He's... he's trying
to create a world.

1:18:04.117 --> 1:18:06.095
- If you want to articulate
your own argument...
- He's using us.

1:18:06.119 --> 1:18:09.156
- Try using your own words,
Alice.
- He's using all of us.

1:18:09.223 --> 1:18:11.191
- In your own words!
- What's in this food?

1:18:11.258 --> 1:18:13.060
Let's talk about that!

1:18:13.126 --> 1:18:15.271
- Where did it come from? Huh?
- Oh,
I'm sorry, everyone.

1:18:15.295 --> 1:18:16.673
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just think about it.

1:18:16.697 --> 1:18:18.799
- I'm sorry, Violet.
- Victory milk.

1:18:18.867 --> 1:18:20.743
- This is... this is an anomaly.
- Victory meat.
Victory eggs.

1:18:20.767 --> 1:18:22.178
- It doesn't usually happen.
- It all comes from him.

1:18:22.202 --> 1:18:24.004
She's very sick

1:18:24.071 --> 1:18:25.816
- and she will get
the help that she needs...
- Everything we're told...

1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:26.851
- I promise you both.
- Everything we are given

1:18:26.875 --> 1:18:27.875
comes from him!

1:18:27.909 --> 1:18:29.142
And it's all about control.

1:18:29.209 --> 1:18:30.677
It's all about control.

1:18:30.744 --> 1:18:32.814
We wouldn't even...
He might be poisoning the food!

1:18:32.881 --> 1:18:34.114
Enough!

1:18:36.116 --> 1:18:37.484
We come to your house,

1:18:38.252 --> 1:18:39.520
we sit at your table,

1:18:39.586 --> 1:18:43.357
and you insult
and degrade my husband?

1:18:43.423 --> 1:18:45.158
He invites you
to be a part of something

1:18:45.225 --> 1:18:47.494
as extraordinary as he is,

1:18:47.561 --> 1:18:51.064
and you sit there
like a spoiled brat,

1:18:51.131 --> 1:18:53.433
demanding answers
to questions you've made up.

1:18:55.202 --> 1:18:58.138
There's a pattern, isn't there?

1:18:58.205 --> 1:19:01.775
A pattern of selfish,
pampered whining.

1:19:04.177 --> 1:19:06.480
Or is it just a desperation
to be exciting?

1:19:07.648 --> 1:19:09.449
Hm?

1:19:09.516 --> 1:19:11.618
Spitting in the face
of this opportunity.

1:19:13.353 --> 1:19:18.625
It's heartbreaking that your
sad, desperate paranoia

1:19:18.692 --> 1:19:20.794
could destroy
what we're trying to build.

1:19:22.462 --> 1:19:23.463
Hm?

1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:29.536
Well, I won't listen to your
pathetic ranting any longer.

1:19:31.204 --> 1:19:33.173
Frank, honey?

1:19:33.975 --> 1:19:35.509
I'll be in the car.

1:19:44.284 --> 1:19:46.286
Well...

1:19:46.353 --> 1:19:49.723
Jack, I think you may have
overserved your wife.

1:19:54.261 --> 1:19:55.495
Thank you.

1:20:16.149 --> 1:20:18.752
I was expecting
so much more from you.

1:20:28.128 --> 1:20:30.330
Good luck, Alice.

1:20:33.133 --> 1:20:35.202
Jack, let's talk.

1:21:37.764 --> 1:21:40.600
Did you enjoy yourself tonight?

1:21:40.667 --> 1:21:42.335
What?

1:21:42.402 --> 1:21:44.504
No, I didn't
enjoy myself tonight.

1:21:44.571 --> 1:21:47.674
You planned a whole evening
to sabotage me.

1:21:47.741 --> 1:21:52.746
No! No, I would never
do that to you.

1:21:52.814 --> 1:21:55.449
I would never do that to you.
I love you.

1:21:57.551 --> 1:22:00.654
I'm trying...
I'm trying to save us.

1:22:00.721 --> 1:22:04.291
You're trying to save us
by going out there.

1:22:05.827 --> 1:22:09.063
Yes, because I saw
a plane crash. I told you.

1:22:09.130 --> 1:22:14.135
But, Jack, everything I said
at that table is true.

1:22:14.202 --> 1:22:15.837
Frank even admitted it to me.

1:22:15.903 --> 1:22:17.771
He admitted it to me
in the kitchen.

1:22:17.839 --> 1:22:20.908
That's why I did that.
That's why
all of that happened.

1:22:20.975 --> 1:22:22.275
He wouldn't have done that.

1:22:30.350 --> 1:22:32.486
Jack...

1:22:32.552 --> 1:22:34.956
Everyone is acting
like I'm crazy.

1:22:36.224 --> 1:22:38.291
And I'm not crazy.

1:22:40.393 --> 1:22:42.629
And I need you to listen to me.

1:22:45.233 --> 1:22:47.601
I need you to listen to me.

1:22:51.304 --> 1:22:53.406
Hey.

1:22:53.473 --> 1:22:57.511
Hey. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1:23:04.218 --> 1:23:05.853
To me...

1:23:08.156 --> 1:23:09.523
You are...

1:23:10.457 --> 1:23:12.592
You are bigger than all of this.

1:23:15.362 --> 1:23:16.630
Mm-hm.

1:23:18.266 --> 1:23:20.367
You are bigger than victory.

1:23:21.301 --> 1:23:22.904
You are bigger than frank.

1:23:25.405 --> 1:23:26.473
I believe in you.

1:23:26.540 --> 1:23:28.408
<i>I believe in you.</i>

1:23:32.180 --> 1:23:33.747
I don't believe in him.

1:23:35.615 --> 1:23:37.417
And I don't trust him.

1:23:39.319 --> 1:23:41.022
And I don't trust this place.

1:23:44.491 --> 1:23:47.594
And I don't want
to be here anymore.

1:23:51.299 --> 1:23:53.433
I don't want to be here anymore.

1:23:53.500 --> 1:23:54.936
And we need to leave.

1:23:57.839 --> 1:24:01.008
We need to leave.
And we can go anywhere.

1:24:01.075 --> 1:24:03.777
We can go anywhere and we can
create our own world,

1:24:03.845 --> 1:24:06.047
and it will be you and me
and we'll be okay.

1:24:06.113 --> 1:24:09.482
And it's not about where we go,
it's just that we're together.

1:24:11.751 --> 1:24:14.822
Please? Please? Please?

1:24:19.927 --> 1:24:21.128
Please?

1:24:25.532 --> 1:24:26.868
Please.

1:24:28.169 --> 1:24:29.837
Okay.

1:24:32.739 --> 1:24:35.375
Okay?

1:24:36.978 --> 1:24:38.913
Okay.

1:24:43.351 --> 1:24:44.819
Okay?

1:24:46.220 --> 1:24:48.055
Okay.

1:24:58.632 --> 1:25:00.868
I love you. I love you.

1:25:02.669 --> 1:25:03.905
But we need to go tonight.

1:25:03.971 --> 1:25:06.173
We need to go.
We can't be here.

1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:08.608
Hey. Hey.

1:25:19.586 --> 1:25:21.488
I love you.
Let's go.

1:25:21.554 --> 1:25:23.057
I love you.

1:25:24.658 --> 1:25:26.861
- Okay.
- 'Kay. Okay.

1:25:49.350 --> 1:25:50.784
Jack?

1:25:50.851 --> 1:25:53.955
I packed us a snack in case
we drive all night long,

1:25:54.021 --> 1:25:56.623
but I think I packed everything.

1:25:57.892 --> 1:25:59.060
Let's go.

1:26:03.763 --> 1:26:06.499
Baby, let's go. Come on.

1:26:06.566 --> 1:26:08.568
I'm sorry.

1:26:10.972 --> 1:26:12.073
What?

1:26:13.908 --> 1:26:15.843
I love you so much, Alice.

1:26:17.744 --> 1:26:19.113
Baby, what's wrong?

1:26:19.180 --> 1:26:21.715
I tried so hard
to keep this from happening.

1:26:22.782 --> 1:26:24.986
- What? Let's...
- Please believe...

1:26:25.052 --> 1:26:26.586
Baby, we need to go.
We need to go.

1:26:26.653 --> 1:26:29.423
Baby, you need to drive.
We need to go. Go. Whoa.

1:26:29.489 --> 1:26:32.259
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No. No! No!

1:26:32.326 --> 1:26:34.996
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Alice.
-No, Jack, please!
I can be better!

1:26:35.062 --> 1:26:37.140
- I can be better! I'm so sorry!
- Alice, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1:26:37.164 --> 1:26:38.641
- Let me be better, please!
- I'm sorry!

1:26:38.665 --> 1:26:39.843
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Baby, please!

1:26:39.867 --> 1:26:41.107
- Let me be better.
- I'm sorry!

1:26:41.135 --> 1:26:42.511
- Get off me!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1:26:42.535 --> 1:26:43.612
- Let me be better!
- I'm sorry.

1:26:43.636 --> 1:26:45.772
- I'm so...
- Jack, please!

1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:50.411
They're hurting me! No! No!

1:26:50.478 --> 1:26:54.315
No! Jack! They're hurting me!

1:26:54.382 --> 1:26:56.117
They're hurting me!

1:26:56.183 --> 1:26:57.584
Fuck!

1:27:01.322 --> 1:27:02.923
Fuck!

1:27:19.273 --> 1:27:23.543
No, please, please.
Please, don't...

1:28:46.894 --> 1:28:48.229
Needle holder.

1:28:50.264 --> 1:28:51.664
Forceps.

1:28:53.267 --> 1:28:55.735
- All right, guys.
'Night.
- 'Night.

1:28:55.803 --> 1:28:57.338
'Night, doctor.

1:29:09.316 --> 1:29:10.717
Good night,
Dr. Warren.

1:29:10.783 --> 1:29:11.986

1:29:22.530 --> 1:29:23.864
<i>the primary question is...</i>

1:29:26.534 --> 1:29:27.935
You're so late.

1:29:28.002 --> 1:29:29.769
I thought you were gonna
be home by 10:00.

1:29:29.837 --> 1:29:32.039
Yeah. So did I.

1:29:33.607 --> 1:29:35.276
Surgery ran really long.

1:29:36.477 --> 1:29:37.811
Well, I'm starving.

1:29:37.878 --> 1:29:38.946
I haven't eaten.

1:29:40.314 --> 1:29:41.748
Why not?

1:29:41.815 --> 1:29:44.418
I wasn't sure what you wanted
and you never texted me back.

1:29:51.058 --> 1:29:53.961
I don't have my phone
in the or, Jack.

1:29:54.028 --> 1:29:55.963
Well, it'd be nice to know that.

1:30:10.044 --> 1:30:12.012
Is the hot water
still not working?

1:30:12.079 --> 1:30:14.048
Called the guy.
He couldn't come today.

1:30:19.687 --> 1:30:21.555
Okay, well,
if I can't take a shower,

1:30:21.622 --> 1:30:23.090
- I gotta go to bed.
- Come on.

1:30:23.157 --> 1:30:24.558
I haven't gotten
to see you all day.

1:30:24.625 --> 1:30:26.403
I know, I'm sorry,
but I'm really tired, baby.

1:30:26.427 --> 1:30:29.363
- Dance with me.
- No. No, Jack. Just stop.

1:30:30.898 --> 1:30:32.633
I just finished a 30-hour shift,

1:30:32.700 --> 1:30:33.901
I sewed up 12 people,

1:30:33.968 --> 1:30:35.502
and I gotta be back
in six hours,

1:30:35.569 --> 1:30:36.736
and I'm so tired.

1:30:36.804 --> 1:30:39.039
I... I just need
to go to bed. Okay?

1:30:53.287 --> 1:30:55.623
<i>I mean, I suppose</i>

1:30:55.689 --> 1:30:58.158
<i>the primary question is...</i>

1:30:59.560 --> 1:31:03.564
<i>Do you know anyone
who's truly happy? Right?</i>

1:31:03.631 --> 1:31:06.000
<i>Or satisfied?</i>

1:31:06.066 --> 1:31:11.272
<i>Modern society
has smothered our true selves,</i>

1:31:11.338 --> 1:31:15.409
<i>and driven us
from, uh, biological destiny.</i>

1:31:15.476 --> 1:31:18.579
<i>I see that version of yourself
that you've buried deep</i>

1:31:18.646 --> 1:31:22.549
<i>and that everyone else ignores.</i>

1:31:22.616 --> 1:31:27.254
<i>That... that is the real you.</i>

1:31:27.321 --> 1:31:32.092
<i>I know that you are the man
you say you are.</i>

1:31:38.599 --> 1:31:39.967
That's better.

1:31:40.834 --> 1:31:42.136
<i>Welcome home.</i>

1:31:44.972 --> 1:31:46.140
Look who's feeling better.

1:31:46.206 --> 1:31:49.109
Oh, thank god!

1:31:49.176 --> 1:31:51.378
Okay, don't shout it
to the whole neighborhood.

1:31:51.445 --> 1:31:53.714
- I'm here.
- Oh! I missed you so much.

1:31:53.781 --> 1:31:55.191
I started writing gossip
in a journal.

1:31:55.215 --> 1:31:56.917
You did? I should read it then.

1:31:56.984 --> 1:31:58.319
- So sad. Hi.
- Hi!

1:31:58.385 --> 1:32:00.154
- Wow, you look sensational!
- Thank you.

1:32:00.220 --> 1:32:01.689
I feel better. I feel good.

1:32:01.755 --> 1:32:03.757
- I'm so happy you're back.
- Me, too.

1:32:03.824 --> 1:32:05.125
Hi, Jack.

1:32:05.192 --> 1:32:06.960
- Wow! Look at this car.
- You like that?

1:32:07.027 --> 1:32:08.738
Dean's gonna try to have sex
with this vehicle.

1:32:08.762 --> 1:32:10.597
Where is Dean?

1:32:10.664 --> 1:32:12.566
He's playing golf with bill.

1:32:12.633 --> 1:32:13.967
Honey, you should go.

1:32:14.034 --> 1:32:15.478
All you've been doing
is looking after me,

1:32:15.502 --> 1:32:17.004
and you deserve
to have some fun.

1:32:17.071 --> 1:32:19.039
Yeah, go. Leave her.
She's mine now.

1:32:19.106 --> 1:32:20.941
- We're gonna garden.
- What?

1:32:21.008 --> 1:32:22.208
Just look at plants and drink.

1:32:22.242 --> 1:32:23.453
- Right.
- I don't have a garden.

1:32:23.477 --> 1:32:24.545
Okay!

1:32:27.715 --> 1:32:29.183
- Bye.

Violet would not stand up.

1:32:45.466 --> 1:32:47.110
It was like her ass was glued
to the chair.

1:32:47.134 --> 1:32:49.103
And peg!
Peg's face was so red,

1:32:49.169 --> 1:32:51.372
I thought her head
was gonna pop off.

1:32:51.939 --> 1:32:53.240

I've seen in my life!

1:33:24.338 --> 1:33:26.240
Did you hire professional
artists to paint it?

1:33:26.306 --> 1:33:27.852
- We made it ourselves.
- You did? No, you didn't.

1:33:27.876 --> 1:33:30.110
Quick, show me. Come show me!

1:33:30.177 --> 1:33:32.246
I did this part.

1:33:32.312 --> 1:33:34.816

1:34:38.545 --> 1:34:42.416
Well, you're a little early,

1:41:14.809 --> 1:41:17.044
Don't you want to be perfect
with me?

1:41:24.718 --> 1:41:26.686
No. No.

1:41:26.753 --> 1:41:29.756
You made me feel like
I was crazy.

1:41:32.326 --> 1:41:34.594
I came to you...

1:41:36.163 --> 1:41:39.699
And you made me feel like
I was fucking crazy.

1:41:39.766 --> 1:41:42.169
Alice, I'm so sorry.

1:41:44.038 --> 1:41:46.941
But I don't have to
lie to you anymore.

1:41:49.010 --> 1:41:50.543
Alice...

1:41:50.610 --> 1:41:52.880
- Alice, please, I love you.
- I know.

1:41:52.947 --> 1:41:55.182
You know I love you.
I would do anything for you.

1:41:55.249 --> 1:41:56.583
You're my whole life.

1:41:57.617 --> 1:42:00.487
I love you. Oh, god.

1:42:00.553 --> 1:42:02.665
It's not about where we are,
it's just that we're together.

1:42:02.689 --> 1:42:05.126
You said that.
You said that to me.

1:42:07.295 --> 1:42:08.896
Alice.

1:42:15.702 --> 1:42:18.105
- Alice, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my god.

1:42:21.075 --> 1:42:22.575
Are there others?

1:42:24.412 --> 1:42:28.015
Are there other people like me?
Where are their bodies?

1:42:28.082 --> 1:42:30.151
- I don't know where they are.
- Oh, god.

1:42:30.217 --> 1:42:31.451
I don't know where they are.

1:42:31.518 --> 1:42:33.753
I don't even know
who the men are. I swear.

1:42:35.189 --> 1:42:36.824
It's not our business.

1:42:36.891 --> 1:42:40.127
A man's responsible for his
own wife and nothing else.

1:42:44.564 --> 1:42:46.733
So all the wives
are trapped here?

1:42:50.637 --> 1:42:52.907
- Oh, my god,
the kids.
- No.

1:42:52.974 --> 1:42:54.974
- Oh, my god.
- No. No, Alice,
the kids aren't real.

1:42:55.009 --> 1:42:56.609
- Oh, god.
- They're not real.

1:42:56.676 --> 1:42:58.712
Don't worry about them.
It's you and me.

1:42:58.778 --> 1:43:00.147
- Look at me.
- No, I...

1:43:00.214 --> 1:43:02.316
Don't worry about them.
Look at me.

1:43:02.383 --> 1:43:04.218
Look at me. It's you and me.

1:43:04.285 --> 1:43:05.719
Okay? It's you and me.

1:43:05.785 --> 1:43:07.620
Stay with me.

1:43:07.687 --> 1:43:10.124
-I just need... mm-hm.
-It's okay.
We're gonna be happy.

1:43:10.191 --> 1:43:11.902
- I just need a second.
- We're gonna be happy here.

1:43:11.926 --> 1:43:13.870
- I just need a second. Yeah?
- We're gonna be happy.

1:43:13.894 --> 1:43:15.062
No, Jack.

1:43:15.129 --> 1:43:17.131
No, Jack, please.

1:43:17.198 --> 1:43:21.936
Stop. Stop. Alice!

1:43:22.003 --> 1:43:23.871
No, I need a second...

1:43:23.938 --> 1:43:27.441
Get off me! I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

1:43:27.507 --> 1:43:30.077
- Get off me!
- Alice, stop it!

1:43:30.144 --> 1:43:33.280
- No! No!
- Stop it, Alice!

1:43:33.347 --> 1:43:35.182
No. No!

1:43:35.249 --> 1:43:36.917
Stop!

1:43:40.388 --> 1:43:41.688
<i>Alice?</i>

1:43:42.289 --> 1:43:43.790
Alice?

1:43:49.997 --> 1:43:51.531
A-Alice?

1:43:53.633 --> 1:43:55.169
What happened?

1:44:10.017 --> 1:44:11.052
What is it?

1:44:11.118 --> 1:44:12.619
<i>Jack chambers is dead.</i>

1:44:14.754 --> 1:44:16.057
Alice, listen to me.

1:44:16.123 --> 1:44:17.467
No, I need
to tell you something, bunny.

1:44:17.491 --> 1:44:18.526
No, you need to leave.

1:44:18.591 --> 1:44:20.161
No. This world isn't real.

1:44:20.227 --> 1:44:23.030
- Alice, they're gonna kill you.
- Frank created a program.

1:44:23.097 --> 1:44:25.765
- And he created a world
and its...
- I know. I know.

1:44:25.833 --> 1:44:27.177
- And they're gonna kill you.
- What?

1:44:27.201 --> 1:44:28.869
They're gonna kill you
in the real world.

1:44:28.936 --> 1:44:29.870
- They're gonna kill
your real body.
- What?

1:44:29.937 --> 1:44:31.038
- You need to go.
- What?

1:44:31.105 --> 1:44:32.940
Okay? Oh, my god.

1:44:33.007 --> 1:44:36.576
Alice, if a man dies here,
he dies in the real world.

1:44:36.643 --> 1:44:38.055
Jack can't put you
back in this time.

1:44:38.079 --> 1:44:39.755
He can't put you back in
like he did before.

1:44:39.779 --> 1:44:41.315
You need to exit again,
right now.

1:44:41.382 --> 1:44:43.583
Alice, you gotta go.
You can drive. Take Jack's car!

1:44:43.650 --> 1:44:45.953
- You need to
go to headquarters.
- Bunny, answer me!

1:44:46.020 --> 1:44:48.721
- You need to go right now!
- What do you mean, you know?

1:44:51.892 --> 1:44:54.161
Listen...

1:44:54.228 --> 1:44:55.229
I've always known.

1:44:59.467 --> 1:45:00.467
I chose this.

1:45:04.604 --> 1:45:08.075
My kids are here.

1:45:08.142 --> 1:45:10.344
- Bunny, your kids aren't real.
- No, they are.

1:45:10.411 --> 1:45:12.379
- Kids aren't real here.
- No, they are.

1:45:12.446 --> 1:45:13.957
-Nothing is real.
-They're real to me.
They're real to me, Alice.

1:45:13.981 --> 1:45:15.392
- Nothing...
- Because here they're alive!

1:45:15.416 --> 1:45:17.118
In here, I didn't lose them.

1:45:18.052 --> 1:45:19.954
Here, I... I can keep them.

1:45:21.355 --> 1:45:22.355
Don't you see?

1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:28.896
What... do they know?

1:45:28.963 --> 1:45:30.498
What about the women,
do they know?

1:45:30.564 --> 1:45:31.899
No.

1:45:33.267 --> 1:45:34.902
They don't know.

1:45:46.113 --> 1:45:47.281
Go.

1:45:48.748 --> 1:45:50.251
You have to go.

1:46:03.130 --> 1:46:05.232
Christ, Alice,
whose blood is that?

1:46:05.732 --> 1:46:06.967
Jack!

1:46:09.270 --> 1:46:12.206
What's going on?
Where's Jack? Dean?

1:46:12.273 --> 1:46:16.010
Go back inside, Alice.
Sweetheart? Stop.

1:46:16.076 --> 1:46:18.145
Where is Jack?
What is she doing?

1:46:18.212 --> 1:46:19.212
Jack!

1:46:24.751 --> 1:46:26.053
Honey, let's go inside.

1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:28.155
We have to go inside, please.

1:46:29.190 --> 1:46:30.257
It's the kids.

1:46:33.227 --> 1:46:34.761
Where is Jack?

1:46:41.035 --> 1:46:44.505
Peg. I need you to go inside
to the kids, peg!

1:46:44.572 --> 1:46:46.407
Peg, she is unwell.

1:46:54.381 --> 1:46:56.150
They said nothing like this
could happen!

1:46:56.217 --> 1:46:57.217
Shut up, bill!

1:46:57.251 --> 1:46:58.385
They promised it was safe!

1:46:58.452 --> 1:46:59.752
Jack!

1:47:05.792 --> 1:47:09.263
<i>It's a reminder of who we are!</i>

1:47:09.330 --> 1:47:12.366
We came to save the world
from itself.

1:47:12.433 --> 1:47:16.937
<i>We are a vanguard of a promise.
We are the future.</i>

1:47:17.004 --> 1:47:19.073
<i>We are a brotherhood
of brilliance,</i>

1:47:19.139 --> 1:47:22.209
<i>every single one of us.</i>

1:47:22.276 --> 1:47:23.877
<i>Approaching victory portal.</i>

1:47:23.944 --> 1:47:27.780
<i>Prepare to exit
in ten, nine, eight...</i>

1:47:27.848 --> 1:47:30.451
- Whose world is this?
- Ours!

1:47:30.517 --> 1:47:32.620
<i>- Whose world is this?
- Ours!</i>

1:47:32.686 --> 1:47:35.022
<i>- Whose world is it?
- Ours!</i>

1:47:35.089 --> 1:47:36.789
<i>- Whose world is it?
- Ours!</i>

1:47:36.857 --> 1:47:39.126
<i>- Whose world is it?
- Alice!</i>

1:47:39.927 --> 1:47:42.596
Go! Go, Alice! Go!

1:47:42.663 --> 1:47:43.998
No, no!

1:47:48.969 --> 1:47:51.872
- Get off me!
- They'll find you!

1:48:24.738 --> 1:48:28.976
Please, please, please!
Don't be such a fucking...

1:48:29.043 --> 1:48:33.047
They said it would not happen!

1:49:37.578 --> 1:49:38.912
Fuck!

1:50:11.578 --> 1:50:13.280
Stop her, you idiots!

1:50:18.419 --> 1:50:19.920
Stop her!

1:50:32.599 --> 1:50:33.599
No, no!

1:50:57.391 --> 1:50:59.393
<i>Security level is red.</i>

1:50:59.460 --> 1:51:01.295
<i>We are under a shelter in place.</i>

1:51:01.361 --> 1:51:04.298
<i>Stay inside and await
further instructions.</i>

1:51:04.364 --> 1:51:06.266
<i>Attention, victory residents.</i>

1:51:06.333 --> 1:51:08.735
<i>Security level is red.</i>

1:51:08.803 --> 1:51:10.304
Where is she?

1:51:10.370 --> 1:51:11.873
<i>Huge crash.</i>

1:51:11.940 --> 1:51:15.275
<i>The two lead cars and Collins.
Collins is dead, sir.</i>

1:51:15.342 --> 1:51:17.644
Listen to me,
you do not let her exit!

1:51:17.711 --> 1:51:19.379
<i>If she gets there,
she gets through.</i>

1:51:19.446 --> 1:51:21.916
<i>Who's gonna put her back in?</i>

1:51:21.982 --> 1:51:23.885
<i>Frank?</i>

1:51:23.952 --> 1:51:27.120
<i>Frank, what do we do? Sir?</i>

1:51:30.825 --> 1:51:34.561
You stupid, stupid man.

1:51:48.075 --> 1:51:49.576
It's my turn now.

1:52:14.903 --> 1:52:17.404
No!

1:52:17.906 --> 1:52:18.906
No!

1:52:20.040 --> 1:52:22.109
Come on! Shit!

1:53:41.288 --> 1:53:43.657
Don't leave me.

1:53:53.367 --> 1:53:54.902

1:53:56.871 --> 1:53:58.238
