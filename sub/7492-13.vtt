00:04.125 --> 00:06.750
Oh, man. I'll tell you,
temple-sitting is the life.

00:06.834 --> 00:07.875
Just look at that view.

00:09.458 --> 00:14.875
-That is 3
-D hi-def surround sound
with quadratronic woofers, baby.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.417
Oh. Hey, Jack,
we should go get our tickets

00:17.500 --> 00:19.041
for our movie tomorrow
before they sell out.

00:19.125 --> 00:20.333
Oh, sweet, I'm in.

00:21.041 --> 00:22.875
Uh, Jerry. It's kind of a date.

00:22.959 --> 00:23.959
Oh, sorry, Jack.

00:24.041 --> 00:26.166
Looks like Kim and I are going on a date.

00:27.667 --> 00:29.250
No. I'm going on a date with Jack.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.417
Make up your mind, woman.

00:35.917 --> 00:38.333
Whoa, we thought the temple was empty.

00:38.750 --> 00:39.792
Who are you people?

00:39.875 --> 00:41.917
We're temple-sitting for the warriors.
Who are you people?

00:42.041 --> 00:43.125
We're plumbers.

00:43.208 --> 00:44.500
We're here to fix the plumbing.

00:44.917 --> 00:46.750
Uh, it's probably my fault.

00:46.834 --> 00:49.041
I just started my new all-fiber diet.

00:49.458 --> 00:50.625
And it has been a--

00:50.709 --> 00:51.542
Rudy!

00:53.417 --> 00:55.667
Ooh! Shark pool comes on
in a couple minutes.

00:55.750 --> 00:57.041
Oh, I love that show.

00:57.667 --> 01:01.041
Innocent dreamers present their inventions
to four millionaires

01:01.125 --> 01:04.291
who crush their spirit and rob them
of their will to live!

01:05.166 --> 01:06.458
I wanna be on it so bad.

01:08.250 --> 01:10.542
Can't get this stupid bottle open.

01:11.709 --> 01:12.583
Oh, I got it.

01:19.625 --> 01:20.542
How'd you do that?

01:20.625 --> 01:21.792
Oh, I used my stomach.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.417
I got really tight abs.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.583
How did you get tight abs
working out at my dojo?

01:28.667 --> 01:29.917
Oh, sparring with Jack.

01:30.333 --> 01:32.125
You know, I've gotten so used
to his stomach blows

01:32.208 --> 01:33.834
that my abs tighten up
before he even hits me.

01:34.542 --> 01:36.125
Oh, that is it!

01:37.750 --> 01:40.834
What if I make a belt that you wear
that simulates little karate chops

01:40.917 --> 01:44.333
making you tighten up
and giving you a beautiful toned stomach.

01:44.959 --> 01:47.959
Oh! I will call it Ninja Abs!

01:49.500 --> 01:51.125
That's a really good idea, Rudy.

01:51.208 --> 01:52.625
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:54.041 --> 01:55.792
-
- You know,

01:55.875 --> 01:58.041
the picture on that TV is pretty amazing.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.667
It's so realistic.

02:00.083 --> 02:03.458
I literally feel like that whale
is giving birth in my lap.

02:04.041 --> 02:04.875
Eww!

02:05.333 --> 02:07.041
Dude, is that what we're watching?

02:07.542 --> 02:10.333
Ah, I thought the little one was
just balancing the big one on his nose.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.959
-
Oh!

02:16.625 --> 02:18.083

03:07.417 --> 03:11.041
we'll be able to mass-produce these belts
and do a live infomercial

03:11.166 --> 03:12.917
to cash in on the fitness craze.

03:13.875 --> 03:14.834
How 'bout it, Lou?

03:14.917 --> 03:17.792
Are you man of vision, spirit and verve?

03:18.291 --> 03:20.834
I can't see without my glasses,

03:20.917 --> 03:26.291
wife killed my spirit and I lost my verve
to a wolverine on a camping trip.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.917
Listen, you, I told you
to fix that toilet upstairs.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.166
Oh, boy.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.375

- Margot, what are you doing?

03:34.458 --> 03:38.500
I'm taking $20 to get my nails done. Eww.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.250
Come on, Margot.
I'll drop you at the mall.

03:42.333 --> 03:43.875
Can't believe those two.

03:43.959 --> 03:46.041
- What was that?
- I said have a nice day!

03:49.417 --> 03:51.875
Okay, I'll give you the loan,

03:51.959 --> 03:55.041
but if you can't pay it back,
I get to keep your dojo.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.083
- Not happening.
- He would never--

03:57.166 --> 03:58.333
- It's a deal.
- What?

03:59.709 --> 04:01.709
Rudy, you can't risk the dojo.

04:01.792 --> 04:04.959
What? If you believe in yourself,
you gotta bet on yourself.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.667
Ohh, I remember this thing.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.208
Yeah, the last time we were here,

04:10.291 --> 04:11.875
I thought it was a fake
and I pulled this--

04:15.250 --> 04:16.500
And that's exactly what happened.

04:16.583 --> 04:17.458
We'll see you, Lou.

04:21.750 --> 04:22.959
That movie was a joke.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.333
- Yeah.
- We were supposed to believe

04:24.417 --> 04:27.166
that a German soldier stopped the war
with nothing but his ballet shoes?

04:27.583 --> 04:29.333
Put down your weapons, guys,

04:29.417 --> 04:31.041
and watch me dance!

04:32.709 --> 04:34.542
Let's go get some frozen yogurt.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.542
Ugh, Karl's working.

04:36.959 --> 04:38.125
He hates everyone.

Kim.

You got it, Jack.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.333
On the house.

04:53.792 --> 04:54.750
Oh, thanks, man.

04:55.458 --> 04:56.792
Let me see. I'll have an--

04:56.875 --> 04:58.083
-
- We're closed.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.542
Why does everyone love you?

05:04.125 --> 05:05.709
It's called the Jack factor.

05:05.792 --> 05:08.667
It's charm, charisma and all this.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.208
Look, Jack, now that we're going out,

05:13.291 --> 05:15.250
my, uh, dad wants to meet you and...

05:15.333 --> 05:17.250
- I tried to get out of it, and I just--
- Kim, relax.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.625
I can't wait to meet him.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.083
Parents love me.
It's part of the Jack factor.

You really think you have something

05:26.083 --> 05:27.208
Hey, where'd you get that?

05:31.583 --> 05:33.583
Unbelievable.

you'd like to lose?

05:54.542 --> 05:55.792
Well, I did.

become big loser just like me.

<i>I used to look like this.</i>

06:08.542 --> 06:10.834

Whoo!

06:13.333 --> 06:16.166
Yeah, my abs are so ripped,
I can do fun things like this.

Wow! That's real parmesan cheese, people!

06:24.917 --> 06:27.000
Mmm! Ab-sy!

06:28.875 --> 06:32.667
Now let my friend Dr. Krupnick
explain how it works.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.417
It works because of science.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.709
Now, let's see it in action.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.000
-
- Ohh!

06:40.083 --> 06:42.166
Each ninja belt is custom designed

06:42.250 --> 06:45.458
with six powerful pistons
to pound the pounds away!

06:54.875 --> 06:56.375

You need to turn it off, Rudy!

06:57.625 --> 06:59.208
- It's not going down.
- Turn it off, Rudy.

she's like, blah, blah, blah.

07:49.667 --> 07:50.667
Let's hear it, Jack.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.125
I love jokes.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.125
Where do penguins keep their money?

07:56.208 --> 07:57.208
In a snowbank.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.166
Oh, you heard this one.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.125
Up top.

08:01.792 --> 08:04.875
Many species of penguin
are endangered, Jack.

08:05.375 --> 08:06.417
You think that's funny?

08:07.750 --> 08:09.709
This isn't one of those laughing jokes.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.000
It's more of a...

08:45.750 --> 08:47.583
But I don't want you to own my dojo.

Xanadu Spa and Resort on Maui-Maui.

for not booking that trip.

-He did?
- I did?

09:23.792 --> 09:24.709
You did.

Yeah, um...

09:26.291 --> 09:30.041
He, he wanted to surprise you
with a luxury vacation

10:37.583 --> 10:39.834
We'll take care of 'em.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.208
Look at me!

10:47.291 --> 10:49.000

10:49.792 --> 10:52.083
I feel like one classy pig.

10:53.208 --> 10:54.709
What's this mud made out of?

10:55.500 --> 10:56.542
Uh...

10:57.166 --> 10:59.542
You see, the complete recipe is a secret,
but I will tell you,

10:59.625 --> 11:03.166
the main ingredients are mineral water
and cleansing volcanic ash.

11:03.583 --> 11:06.625
Ooh! Fancy!

11:09.000 --> 11:10.542
Where'd you get volcanic ash?

11:10.625 --> 11:12.291
No, I didn't.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.583
I just scooped a bunch of stuff
out of the bottom of a barbecue

11:14.667 --> 11:17.917
and mixed it with a bag
of something called gro-u-t.

11:19.041 --> 11:20.667
Uh, excuse me?

11:21.208 --> 11:23.208
I think I found a rib bone.

11:25.041 --> 11:28.000
Uh... Yeah! Yeah, that's...

11:28.083 --> 11:29.959

It, um, uh...

11:31.667 --> 11:35.750
Opens up your pores
and pulls out bones you don't need.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.041
See?

11:38.166 --> 11:41.917
I told that doctor I had an extra bone,
but he didn't believe me.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.625
I'm keeping my bones.

11:44.709 --> 11:45.792
I'm getting out.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.792
Uh, I can't move.

11:53.291 --> 11:54.041
Jerry!

11:54.125 --> 11:55.000
Yeah?

11:55.667 --> 11:57.917
This bag isn't gro-u-t. It's grout.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.083
Uh, it's what the warriors use
to patch the walls.

12:00.166 --> 12:01.250
It's like cement.

12:01.959 --> 12:03.375
I can't move.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.041
I can't move!

12:05.917 --> 12:09.959
You two numbskulls
are gonna cost Rudy his dojo.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.750
Here, enjoy the relaxing vibrations
of this high-impact massager.

12:18.834 --> 12:19.667
On the house.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.291
Ow! Ow!

12:23.375 --> 12:25.166
He's gonna rip my head off, ma!

12:25.250 --> 12:26.083
Ow!

12:27.542 --> 12:29.208
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

12:29.291 --> 12:31.834
You were awesome!

12:31.917 --> 12:34.333
I don't think that eight-year-old
is ever gonna play laser tag again.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.375
Well, when I saw him in my sights, I said

12:36.458 --> 12:40.458
"Kid, if you're tall enough to play,
you're tall enough to eat laser."

12:41.709 --> 12:43.542
We're finally gonna beat Riley
from accounting

12:43.625 --> 12:45.792
and win your company's
laser tag shootout tomorrow.

12:45.875 --> 12:49.083
There they are!
My favorite father and daughter!

12:49.166 --> 12:50.083
Oh, boy...

12:51.792 --> 12:54.166
Mr. Crawford,
I feel like we got off on the wrong foot,

12:54.250 --> 12:56.417
so I got you a little gift.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.625
Oh, that wasn't necessary. But thanks.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.250
Hey, it's the tie I saw at Bergdoff's.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.250
How did you know?

13:03.333 --> 13:06.750
Well, I saw you go into Bergdoff's,
so I kinda followed you in.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.625
Kim. Your boyfriend is stalking me.

13:10.333 --> 13:15.625
It's not so much stalking as following you
with a borderline unhealthy interest.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.333
Okay.

13:18.417 --> 13:20.375
It's all a little too weird for me.

13:20.458 --> 13:21.667
Come on, Kim, let's go.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.250
Jack,

13:24.375 --> 13:25.959
my father already doesn't like you.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.125
I mean, you're making things worse.
What are you doing?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.750
I don't even know what's happening.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.750
Kim, you gotta set me up
on a second date with your dad.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.250
You want a second date with my dad?

13:35.917 --> 13:37.166
More than anything.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.500
Oh.

13:43.208 --> 13:44.834
Hello. Reservations?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.291
There's no one here.

13:48.083 --> 13:49.166
Name?

13:49.250 --> 13:50.208
Lou.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.542
Well, as you can see, sir,
we're very busy.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.083
Oh, look! Something just opened up.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.083
Follow me.

14:01.709 --> 14:02.959
Rudy, we're in trouble.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.333
Rudy, we're in trouble.

14:05.417 --> 14:08.875
Relax, it's not about what the food is,
it's how you describe it.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.667
Good evening.

14:12.750 --> 14:15.000
I am your server Rudolpho.

14:15.500 --> 14:19.458
Tonight's special is marinated seeds
of the monocot plant,

14:19.542 --> 14:24.000
with a side of <i>oryza sativa</i>
from the pearl river valley of china.

14:24.083 --> 14:27.041
Ooh, exotic!

14:27.750 --> 14:28.667
What is that?

14:28.750 --> 14:31.583
It's rice with a side of rice.

14:33.375 --> 14:34.875
I'll send over the salad boy.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.834
Oh, salad boy!

14:37.834 --> 14:40.333
Oh, salad-- I'm the salad boy, aren't I?

14:42.208 --> 14:43.208
I'm going.

14:46.625 --> 14:47.709
Some lettuce,

14:48.375 --> 14:49.333
onions,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.417
tomatoes, croutons...

14:54.000 --> 14:55.500
And we toss.

15:07.250 --> 15:08.834
I'll be back with some more salad.

15:11.959 --> 15:16.041
Oh, we would like to offer you
a complimentary bottle of sparkling cider,

15:16.125 --> 15:19.375
which I will personally select
from our world-renowned cellar.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.667
Just one second.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.709
No! No!

15:26.792 --> 15:28.750
Ahh, yes!

15:31.125 --> 15:33.083
Oh, here we are.

15:33.792 --> 15:35.750
Just one second.

15:44.041 --> 15:45.125
Shaolin treasure?

15:46.250 --> 15:47.667
You guys aren't plumbers, are you?

15:49.125 --> 15:50.875
- Get 'em, guys!
- Whoa!

15:52.792 --> 15:54.917
Oh, look, mommy,
they're putting on a show!

15:56.083 --> 15:57.291
It's not a show.

15:57.542 --> 16:00.375
Your father, the genius,
has booked our vacation

16:00.458 --> 16:01.542
in the middle of a robbery!

16:01.625 --> 16:02.458
What?

16:02.542 --> 16:04.083
- Why would you do that?
- You've really outdone yourself...

16:04.166 --> 16:05.500
Hey, what kind of robbery is this?

16:05.583 --> 16:08.041
Can I get a couple of gags
over here, please?

16:14.750 --> 16:16.250
- Yeah, yo!
- Oh, yeah!

16:18.125 --> 16:19.834
You made it to the final round!

16:20.417 --> 16:22.208
Go, Crawfords!

16:22.291 --> 16:23.959
Hey.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.250
Everywhere I go, he's just...

16:28.875 --> 16:29.875
there.

16:30.166 --> 16:33.709
Dad, he's here because he's my boyfriend
and I invited him.

16:34.041 --> 16:36.208
Now be nice. I'm gonna go grab a water.

16:38.792 --> 16:39.709
Oh!

16:39.875 --> 16:41.083
Are you okay?

16:41.166 --> 16:44.083
I don't know.
I twisted my ankle on the sensor vest.

16:44.750 --> 16:45.583
I think I'm fine.

16:45.959 --> 16:47.166
No, no! Not fine!

16:47.250 --> 16:48.250
- Oh!
- Not fine!

16:48.333 --> 16:51.250
Oh no, honey, you can't compete like this.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.083
I'll have to forfeit.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.458
Riley wins again.

16:56.542 --> 16:59.166
Are you allowed to play with a substitute?

16:59.625 --> 17:00.458
Why?

17:02.792 --> 17:03.917
You know I still don't like you?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.750
Yeah, I got that
when you tried to shoot me.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.208
Twice.

17:12.875 --> 17:15.792
Riley's behind that barrel
and his son's behind that one.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.208
And there's no way out.

17:17.792 --> 17:20.250
Well, I'll just have to make myself
hard to hit.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.417
Whatever. No, don't go out there!

17:22.500 --> 17:23.625
You'll never come back.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.375
Ha-ha! We've got you now.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.500
Oh!

17:37.583 --> 17:40.250
Look at what you did!
You took your own son out, Riley!

17:40.375 --> 17:42.375
-
- You're gonna pay for this, Crawford.

17:42.458 --> 17:43.417
Oh--

17:43.959 --> 17:45.000
No!

17:48.709 --> 17:50.500
You guys did it! You won!

17:50.583 --> 17:52.291
Yes! Oh, Jack!

17:53.208 --> 17:55.709
That was the bravest thing
I have ever seen.

17:57.542 --> 18:00.834
What do you say you, me and your...

18:01.500 --> 18:04.125
...boyfriend here go out
and get some pizza?

18:04.166 --> 18:06.291
Oh, yes!

18:06.375 --> 18:08.458
Jack, you did it.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.083
My dad finally likes you.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.333
Okay, come on, let's go.

18:16.542 --> 18:18.834
You're not wondering why I'm not limping?

18:19.166 --> 18:21.542
No, I know you faked an injury
so I could look like a hero

18:21.625 --> 18:22.750
and bond with your dad.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.083
Part of all this...

18:24.792 --> 18:25.625
is this.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.166

Hey.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.792
You think they can fix the leak
in the upstairs faucet?

18:37.917 --> 18:39.709
They're not plumbers, they're thieves.

18:40.000 --> 18:40.959
I mean, they could be both.

18:41.041 --> 18:42.583
My father says our plumber's a thief.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.041
We can't let them
steal everything in the temple.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.208
We gotta stop 'em.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.834
Maybe I could help.

You?

18:51.583 --> 18:53.375

18:55.125 --> 18:56.000

19:03.667 --> 19:05.542
He just wants to make you two happy.

19:05.625 --> 19:06.667
You should be ashamed.

19:08.542 --> 19:10.667
Thank you, Rudy. I appreciate that.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.458
Well, it reached a point where I was like,
give this poor guy...

19:13.542 --> 19:15.750
Lou! How did you get your hands free?

19:15.834 --> 19:18.667

19:26.333 --> 19:27.166

19:27.250 --> 19:28.709

20:00.917 --> 20:02.000
You guys all right?

20:02.083 --> 20:04.000
Thanks to you, baby!

20:04.083 --> 20:06.750
That was the bravest thing I've ever seen!

20:06.834 --> 20:11.834
I'm going to call all my friends
and tell them about my daddy, the hero.

20:16.875 --> 20:20.458
Rudy, that was the worst vacation
I've ever taken.

20:21.417 --> 20:24.542
But your debt's forgiven
and you can keep your dojo.

20:24.917 --> 20:28.959
I think, because of you, my family's
gonna look at me in a whole new light.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.417
Lou! Get my suitcases!

20:31.500 --> 20:33.417
We're gettin' outta here now!

20:35.667 --> 20:36.500
Maybe not.

20:36.583 --> 20:37.834
Coming, sunshine!

20:42.542 --> 20:44.834
I don't remember the last time
I had this much fun with someone.

You know, I feel like I can totally
