WEBVTT

00:52.878 --> 00:54.296
Uncle Donald.

00:54.379 --> 00:55.423
(BLOWING)

01:34.060 --> 01:35.312
Thank you.

01:36.438 --> 01:38.316
Is this it?

01:38.400 --> 01:40.444
Yes, the rest of my luggage
will be arriving by train
this morning.

01:40.528 --> 01:41.821
I'll have it collected later.

01:43.490 --> 01:47.285
You said you'd never follow
in your father's footsteps.

01:47.370 --> 01:50.792
He said he was going to leave
Glenbogle to be a pop star.

01:50.875 --> 01:55.757
Hair down to his waist
in those days
and purple flares.

01:55.841 --> 01:58.344
-I recall none of this.
-Oh peace, man.

01:58.428 --> 01:59.887
Excuse me,
I was never a hippie.

01:59.971 --> 02:01.889
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

02:07.356 --> 02:08.775
Well, let's get it over with.

02:11.362 --> 02:14.241
I do hope you're not going
to all this trouble
on my account.

02:14.325 --> 02:16.911
It's your 60th birthday,
Molly. It's a big day.

02:16.995 --> 02:21.043
Well, the bus pass will be
a boon and I shall definitely
wear more purple.

02:21.126 --> 02:24.464
You are having a party
and that is that.

02:24.547 --> 02:26.800
Now, we can have the buffet
in the dining room

02:26.884 --> 02:28.803
and we can clear the hallway
for all the dancing.

02:31.015 --> 02:32.767
Lexie.

02:32.851 --> 02:36.938
There will be so many
absent friends.

02:37.023 --> 02:39.068
There will be plenty there
to make your special day.

02:41.404 --> 02:43.032
And Donald should be
arriving soon.

03:05.271 --> 03:06.481
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

03:11.446 --> 03:12.447
Molly.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.453
Just as beautiful as ever.

03:17.997 --> 03:19.040
You haven't changed either.

03:20.251 --> 03:22.378
Ha! Well...

03:22.461 --> 03:25.591
Hello, I'm Lexie.
Nice to meet you.

03:27.636 --> 03:29.221
She's far too good for you.

03:29.304 --> 03:31.266
BOTH: Oh, no, we're not...

03:31.349 --> 03:36.023
I mean...
Actually, I'm married
to Paul's brother Archie.

03:36.106 --> 03:39.193
-PAUL: He's in New Zealand.
-We're both in New Zealand.

03:39.277 --> 03:41.530
Well, except I'm here but...
(STUTTERS)

03:41.612 --> 03:43.491
I mean just, what,
for the moment.

03:46.746 --> 03:49.708
Er, Uncle...er, Donald...

03:49.791 --> 03:55.842
I, um... I had hoped to have
a speech prepared
but there's a...

03:55.925 --> 03:58.179
There's a certain lack
of information,

03:58.262 --> 04:01.600
so I'd just like to say,
welcome home.

04:01.683 --> 04:04.187
Mi casa, su casa.
My house is your house.

04:05.481 --> 04:07.483
-PAUL: Cheers.
-ALL: Welcome home.

04:10.446 --> 04:12.031
Ave atque vale.

04:14.201 --> 04:15.411
Hello...

04:16.913 --> 04:17.915
And goodbye.

04:20.209 --> 04:22.838
Not so fast, Donald MacDonald.

04:29.889 --> 04:33.603
December 23rd of that year,
exceeding the speed limit,

04:33.686 --> 04:37.400
viz 82mph in Park Lane,
London.

04:37.483 --> 04:40.571
One should not be late
for luncheon at the Palace.

04:40.655 --> 04:45.787
Which brings us on to 1981,
January 1st, Princes Street,
Edinburgh.

04:45.870 --> 04:49.667
Driving in excess
of the legal speed limit
whilst playing the bagpipes.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.378
It was Hogmanay.

04:59.556 --> 05:01.016
Is this really necessary?

05:01.100 --> 05:05.189
Mr MacDonald is to remain
here initially for six months.

05:05.273 --> 05:10.196
He will not be needing
the temptation of cash
or credit cards.

05:10.280 --> 05:16.246
Furthermore, he is to report
to me morning and night
on the house phone

05:16.329 --> 05:20.169
and is not to leave the estate
unless accompanied
by the Laird.

05:21.962 --> 05:23.757
I suppose
your mother loves you.

05:25.342 --> 05:28.180
The alternative is a spell
in clink.

05:28.263 --> 05:30.433
Under the terms of
this supervision order,

05:30.516 --> 05:33.187
you are what is known as
a loco parentis.

05:34.063 --> 05:35.106
That's jargon.

05:35.190 --> 05:37.067
I know what it means.

05:37.150 --> 05:41.823
In the eyes of the law,
I am my uncle's father.

05:41.907 --> 05:44.785
I hope you make a better job
of it than the last one.

05:44.869 --> 05:46.455
The vet's going to see
the wolf tomorrow.

05:51.796 --> 05:54.424
All this red tape
just to send a wolf abroad.

05:55.176 --> 05:56.803
Monday, as arranged.

05:56.886 --> 05:58.472
Everything's fixed
at their end.

05:59.640 --> 06:00.892
Hi.

06:00.975 --> 06:03.104
Hi. I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

06:03.187 --> 06:05.357
-No, 'course not.
-No.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.611
Well I was just thinking,
we'd normally have started
taking the bookings now.

06:09.278 --> 06:10.531
The stalkers?

06:10.614 --> 06:12.575
Yeah, I was getting round
to that.

06:12.659 --> 06:15.871
Only I've just had a wee
ring round some
of the regulars.

06:15.955 --> 06:20.503
-Plenty of interest?
-Usual suspects. One or two
new leads. Word of mouth.

06:20.586 --> 06:22.422
I'll follow it up if you want.

06:22.506 --> 06:25.760
-Yeah sure I'll do that.
-Unless you want to.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.513
No, go ahead.
You know what you're doing.

06:31.184 --> 06:32.937
Sausage! Bacon!

06:33.813 --> 06:35.858
Come on, get out of there!

06:35.941 --> 06:40.781
That's our cabbage patch,
you silly things.
Come on, get out!

06:40.865 --> 06:43.452
-Go, go!
-(CHUCKLES)

06:43.535 --> 06:46.372
-Is everything okay?
-Great, thanks.

06:49.710 --> 06:54.467
Beats nine to five
in a glass box, and I
certainly sleep at nights.

06:54.550 --> 06:56.970
-Simple pleasures.
-Best always are, eh?

06:59.223 --> 07:00.559
Should that be happening?

07:01.769 --> 07:03.438
Oh, no! Can you get the gate?

07:04.856 --> 07:07.067
Oh, no! Quick! Shit!

07:17.248 --> 07:19.960
PAUL: The French
want a wolf centre like ours.

07:20.045 --> 07:22.297
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

07:22.380 --> 07:25.052
-Yeah, but Moonshadow?
-She's a breeding female.

07:26.762 --> 07:29.849
She's been here from
the very start.

07:30.601 --> 07:32.604
The very first day.

07:32.687 --> 07:36.109
Supporting conservation
was always the plan.

07:36.192 --> 07:37.986
I thought
you and Archie agreed this.

07:39.988 --> 07:43.494
We've been months talking
to the authorities here
and abroad.

07:43.577 --> 07:46.206
I know, and I wasn't here
and it's all sorted.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.168
-Too late.
-No.

07:50.379 --> 07:51.463
No, it isn't.

07:52.841 --> 07:55.344
-If you really object.
-Look at her, Paul.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.390
She's happy.

08:01.602 --> 08:02.771
This is her home.

08:14.829 --> 08:16.415
Hello, old girl.

08:16.498 --> 08:19.627
I am neither old,
nor am I a girl,

08:19.711 --> 08:22.423
I am something in-between,
thank you very much.

08:22.507 --> 08:26.095
-Be careful with that,
it's priceless.
-This?

08:26.179 --> 08:29.641
Hector won it shooting
at Inversneckie fair.
I was there.

08:30.351 --> 08:31.352
(SIGHS)

08:33.188 --> 08:34.190
This is priceless.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.277
Put it down.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.822
You know, I reckon with
so few diversions round here,

08:39.905 --> 08:42.577
the basic decencies
might be observed.

08:42.659 --> 08:44.829
Those are reserved
for the basically decent.

08:44.913 --> 08:46.874
Ah, believe me,

08:48.376 --> 08:51.379
if there was anywhere else
to go, I'd be there.

08:51.464 --> 08:55.803
What about,
what do they call them now,
a retirement community?

08:55.887 --> 08:59.558
I went to see a chum
much older than me
in one of those places.

08:59.642 --> 09:04.732
A modest party ensued which
finally involved the fire
departments of three counties.

09:04.816 --> 09:09.072
There must be some corner
of the globe where you're not
on the Ten Most-Wanted list.

09:13.662 --> 09:15.456
Don't you worry...

09:15.540 --> 09:19.503
I'll be out of your house
and out of your life
in no time at all.

09:19.586 --> 09:21.756
Aren't you a little
old for a life on the run?

09:22.925 --> 09:24.885
Old?

09:24.969 --> 09:29.642
In 36 hours
the animal transport arrives,
and now you're telling me...

09:29.725 --> 09:31.770
Well, what are you telling me?

09:31.854 --> 09:34.023
It's only right that
Lexie should be consulted.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.068
You really haven't got
the hang of this shit, son,
have you?

09:36.151 --> 09:38.530
This is not a democracy.

09:38.613 --> 09:40.199
Well, maybe they'll accept
a delay.

09:40.283 --> 09:42.786
Yeah, maybe,
but the press won't.

09:42.870 --> 09:45.415
They'll be looking
for a story.

09:45.498 --> 09:47.918
Not to mention
the television and the press
on the French side.

09:48.002 --> 09:50.505
-I mean, be reasonable.
-I am being reasonable.

09:50.589 --> 09:53.050
No, no, being reasonable is
you fulfilling your contracts

09:53.134 --> 09:55.053
and avoiding you and me
looking foolish.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.055
She's got a lot on her mind,
okay? She's...

09:58.391 --> 09:59.809
She doesn't need
any more upset.

10:02.606 --> 10:03.773
What are you going to tell me?

10:07.988 --> 10:10.867
So that would be a secret
between you and
your brother's wife, would it?

10:16.791 --> 10:21.131
-(CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING)
-Come on! Come on, old girl...

10:21.215 --> 10:22.634
Get me out of here.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.012
Let's run away together.

10:26.180 --> 10:27.306
Come on!

10:28.767 --> 10:30.019
Come on!

10:30.603 --> 10:32.564
Ah, thanks.

10:32.648 --> 10:34.942
Now I'm as loco
as the next parentis,

10:35.026 --> 10:38.280
but I've got enough on
without having to police you
all the time.

10:40.367 --> 10:43.663
I'm being held against
my will, it's an affront
to my human rights!

10:43.746 --> 10:45.958
I think you'll find
you sacrificed those

10:46.041 --> 10:48.836
when you got in the Guinness
Book Of Records for the most
motoring offences ever.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.799
Four little words,
Le Mans, '62.

10:51.882 --> 10:54.636
I'm not to be judged as mere
mortal men are.

10:54.719 --> 10:56.347
Now, give me that rotor arm
and I'll be on my way.

10:56.430 --> 10:58.934
I want to put this in words
that even a MacDonald
would understand.

10:59.017 --> 11:02.606
You bunk off,
and we are in trouble.
Now, give it up.

11:02.690 --> 11:06.486
I suppose you've removed
the rotor arm from all
the estate vehicles, eh?

11:07.195 --> 11:08.281
No need.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.506
You know, I really meant
what I said about the party.

11:20.590 --> 11:22.718
I couldn't feel less
like celebrating.

11:22.801 --> 11:24.845
You will. You know you will.

11:24.928 --> 11:26.681
Hector's brother
is the last straw.

11:28.684 --> 11:31.521
-What is the problem with him?
-He's here.

11:31.605 --> 11:35.485
I don't know what Paul
was thinking about,
agreeing to this arrangement.

11:37.321 --> 11:38.656
Should my ears be burning?

11:40.451 --> 11:42.119
Donald.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.291
I thought I was doing
the right thing, Molly.
He's family.

11:45.374 --> 11:46.459
He's...

11:47.418 --> 11:48.629
You might have asked, Paul.

11:54.470 --> 11:58.768
Check that bread out, Paul.
Local farm used to supply us,
want to start again.

12:06.111 --> 12:08.198
We used to drive tanks
made out of this.

12:08.281 --> 12:09.699
Makes sense to buy local.

12:14.790 --> 12:16.876
-Donald?
-Oh, Golly.

12:25.597 --> 12:28.768
I have to get away
from here, Golly,
or it will drive me mad.

12:28.851 --> 12:32.899
You've been away
for 40 years, Donald.
You were always mad anyway.

12:32.983 --> 12:38.574
-Not always. But events,
dear boy, events.
-GOLLY: What, here?

12:38.657 --> 12:42.705
Forty years ago,
when we were young and green.

12:42.788 --> 12:43.872
Those were the days, eh?

12:45.125 --> 12:47.168
I seemed to spend
most of them in here,

12:47.252 --> 12:49.880
paying for some misdemeanour
or another.

12:49.964 --> 12:55.347
(CHUCKLING)
My father always said
that I'd turn out a bad lot.

12:55.431 --> 12:57.308
Ah, come on,
there were some good times.

12:57.391 --> 13:02.774
Yeah. I remember being made
captain of the school
second 15.

13:02.858 --> 13:04.985
There you are, then.

13:05.069 --> 13:07.823
Father shook me briefly
by the hand and told me
not to let the side down,

13:07.906 --> 13:10.076
though he supposed
I probably would.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.164
-And did you?
-Of course.

13:13.247 --> 13:16.126
Bloody pointless game anyway.

13:16.209 --> 13:19.297
I brought Wendy Miller up here
instead.

13:19.380 --> 13:21.634
So this was your teenage
love nest?

13:21.717 --> 13:23.803
Uh-huh.

13:23.887 --> 13:27.643
A damn sight more entertaining
than scrumming in the mud
with a bunch of smelly boys.

13:30.271 --> 13:33.400
-Do you remember about
Wendy Miller?
-Can't say that I do, no.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.363
Think on her now, eh?

13:36.446 --> 13:39.075
Think on poor old
Wendy Miller.

13:40.577 --> 13:42.245
Look at me. Look at me, Golly.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.376
Like some old wounded animal

13:45.459 --> 13:47.879
dragging itself home
to breathe its last.

13:48.797 --> 13:49.839
Ha!

13:53.053 --> 13:56.641
And yet, a moment's
carelessness

13:56.724 --> 14:00.438
with something as trivial
as a wheel clamp.

14:06.989 --> 14:07.991
Cheese and chutney.

14:11.954 --> 14:13.290
-Lex.
-Yeah?

14:14.249 --> 14:17.169
I've been thinking, um...

14:17.253 --> 14:21.134
Probably best all round if I
handle things on my own
from now on.

14:21.676 --> 14:23.470
Oh.

14:23.554 --> 14:27.685
-Not like we're rushed off our
feet or anything.
-No, course not.

14:27.768 --> 14:30.522
And I don't want anyone
to get the wrong end
of the stick.

14:31.565 --> 14:32.650
Well, you're still the boss.

14:33.901 --> 14:36.363
Not about that.

14:36.447 --> 14:39.576
Well, look, I've got plenty
I can be getting on
with anyway.

14:40.786 --> 14:43.123
So, you know,
it works out both ways.

14:44.458 --> 14:45.918
-You don't mind?
-Me?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.464
No. Here.

14:49.673 --> 14:50.675
Good.

14:51.551 --> 14:52.553
That's good, then.

14:55.057 --> 14:56.058
Right.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.367
Knock, knock. Come in.

15:10.286 --> 15:11.537
I'm at the end of my tether.

15:13.207 --> 15:14.625
You've only been here
eight hours.

15:14.708 --> 15:17.212
Not the less. The conditions
of my incarceration

15:17.295 --> 15:20.425
are outside the terms
of the Geneva Convention.

15:21.718 --> 15:22.762
You just made that up.

former dictator

in his tool shed.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.358
No, you're a Scottish aristo,
much more trouble.

15:32.441 --> 15:33.568
I shall just fade away, then.

I haven't got one.

anything to say to me,

to say it to my face.

to say to you?

buying my bread.

15:57.811 --> 15:59.104

patronise me

16:00.815 --> 16:02.776

just 'cause of who I am.

16:02.860 --> 16:04.695
I wasn't going to.

16:04.778 --> 16:10.203
Good. Because I won't sell my
Highland granary cobs
to a Sassenach

16:10.287 --> 16:12.414
who's playing
at being a Laird.

16:12.497 --> 16:17.379
Fine, 'cause I'd only buy them
if I was playing at
being a dry-stone waller.

-Hah, you've really burnt
your bridges now.
-Oh, no.

16:21.552 --> 16:24.264
Because, if you won't buy
my whole-wheat bread,

16:24.348 --> 16:27.895

my delicious old-breed pork,

carrots, turnips...

16:30.315 --> 16:33.778
-You supply vegetables too?
-Not to you.

imposes a complete trade
embargo on the big house.

to the shops, then.

contract and now you throw
the rest away as well.

Well, it serves him right.

-You are Kate's granddaughter,
aren't you?
-Yes.

a complete nuisance, but...

17:09.953 --> 17:15.211

at your gran's farm
than I did here.

-And to think I traded that
for my well-paid job,

soft comfy chair
and crisp monthly pay checks.

-And good secretaries
at such a premium.
-I was a head-hunter.

-Having trouble?
-No, it's fine.

set you back?

17:48.507 --> 17:50.135
-50 quid.
-50 quid?

17:54.265 --> 17:56.560
I'll take it off your hands
for 40.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.562

want to do that?

17:58.646 --> 17:59.898

-Not to escape Glenbogle?
-Oh, nonsense.

-50, you said?
-I said 40...
Oh, well, all right, 50.

as an old Harrovian.

-Well, that's plenty
good enough for me.
-Good, good.

I'd hand over my moped,

me down 50 quid?

too clever for me.

we're in a relationship,

Lexie?

29:26.025 --> 29:27.736
LEXIE: Hold on a minute!

29:36.623 --> 29:40.212
Sorry, lady of leisure now.

29:40.295 --> 29:43.341
I want you to take a full part
in running this place
for as long as you're here.

29:45.177 --> 29:46.721
Are you sure this
is what you want?

29:46.804 --> 29:48.765
Positive. You?

29:52.688 --> 29:54.315
And, Paul...

29:56.109 --> 29:58.404
-Thank you.
-What for?

30:00.365 --> 30:02.242
You belong here.

30:04.829 --> 30:06.248
I'd better...

30:08.960 --> 30:12.256
When washing their hair,
good girls take
their clothes off.

30:13.592 --> 30:14.801
Right.

30:14.885 --> 30:16.637
Right.

30:38.126 --> 30:39.378
What?

30:39.461 --> 30:41.964
Sic transit gloria mundi!

30:42.048 --> 30:45.261
I was just musing on
the ravages of time,
et cetera.

30:45.345 --> 30:47.389
It comes to us all.

30:47.472 --> 30:50.727
Yes, and brings with it wisdom
as you are old enough
and wise enough to understand.

30:50.811 --> 30:53.856
Having one foot in the grave
is no reason for a party.

30:53.940 --> 30:57.069
-That was never my objection.
-Of course not, no.

30:57.152 --> 30:59.364
If my family aren't here...

30:59.447 --> 31:03.662
Exactly. Who's going to fill
your hotty and put you to bed
when you get overtired?

31:03.745 --> 31:07.291
-I don't get overtired.
-Very wise at your age.

31:07.375 --> 31:12.424
Save your breath
to cool your Horlicks
and put off the evil day.

31:12.508 --> 31:17.431
Listen, mush, I can boogie
with the best, dance till dawn
and drink till doomsday,

31:17.515 --> 31:19.600
so don't give me
this old routine,

31:19.684 --> 31:22.564
or I'll give you an injury
from which you
may never recover.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.204
Time to un-cancel the party.

31:34.288 --> 31:35.957
-She's never agreed?
-Well, not quite,

31:36.041 --> 31:38.836
but all the better
for it being a surprise.

31:38.919 --> 31:41.882
Well, if you're right,
that means
we can't use the house.

31:41.965 --> 31:45.971
-Oh, don't back out now.
-No, I'm not going to.

31:46.055 --> 31:50.728
-I think I might have found
the perfect solution.
-I'll help in any capacity.

31:50.811 --> 31:53.398
Perhaps I could look after
the car parking.

31:53.482 --> 31:57.571
Great idea, Uncle.
And we can put King Herod
in charge of the creche!

32:01.117 --> 32:03.704
A few sandwiches
and some chips, you say?

32:03.788 --> 32:06.124
Yeah, it'll be just right
under the circumstances.

32:06.208 --> 32:09.170
You're part of the estate
and our kitchen's
out of bounds.

32:09.253 --> 32:14.010
-So, here you are, and you
need my stuff after all.
-Something like that, yeah.

32:14.094 --> 32:16.889
Well, I'm sure
I can bail you out.

32:16.972 --> 32:18.809
Well that's exceptionally
generous of you.

32:18.892 --> 32:20.937
Honestly, the work
of a moment.

32:21.020 --> 32:23.732
Well, if it's that easy,
you mentioned old-breed pork
and organic spuds.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.860
Best in the Glen.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.404
Do you know what would really
go down well, though, would be
the full-on hog roast.

32:27.487 --> 32:28.656
Cope with that?

32:28.739 --> 32:31.368
That's the complete pig,
like, the whole animal?

32:31.451 --> 32:34.038
Yeah, the sort of thing
my regiment used to organise
at the drop of a hat.

32:34.122 --> 32:38.753
If it only takes one regiment
of men to do it, it should be
a stroll in the park for me.

32:38.837 --> 32:40.172
Great. Hog roast?

32:42.466 --> 32:44.177
Hog roast.

32:44.261 --> 32:48.392
Eeny...meeny...miny...mo.

32:50.895 --> 32:54.400
Catch the piggy by its toe.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.952
Hello? Mrs Duff.

33:02.035 --> 33:03.663
-Hello.
-Is Specky in?

33:05.207 --> 33:06.584
Jess?

33:31.368 --> 33:34.581
What can I tell you?
His name's Dan.

33:34.664 --> 33:37.210
He's a radio producer.
Music, you know?

33:38.545 --> 33:41.591
Really?
Did you meet anyone famous?

33:41.674 --> 33:45.472
Oh, yeah, including
the wee rock chick
he dumped me for.

33:45.555 --> 33:46.848
(GROANING)

33:46.932 --> 33:49.977
-There are some wasters about.
-You're telling me.

33:50.062 --> 33:54.567
Find one who's not,
take his wheels off,
stick him up on bricks...

33:54.651 --> 33:56.779
...he's going nowhere.

33:56.862 --> 33:58.198
Cheers.

34:01.411 --> 34:03.539
This is great, eh, Specky?

34:03.622 --> 34:06.626
Actually, it's Nigel.

34:06.709 --> 34:10.132
We had some great times
at school, didn't we, Nigel?

34:10.215 --> 34:13.052
Mostly you putting my head
down the toilet
and pulling the chain.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.726
At last...

34:18.810 --> 34:22.063
-Pac-Man meets Braveheart.
-For the mobile generation.
I know.

34:24.025 --> 34:26.279
That thing's a telephone too,
by the way.

34:29.908 --> 34:31.202
(DOORBELL RINGING)

34:32.580 --> 34:34.623
Hi, Molly!

34:34.706 --> 34:39.714
-You got your hot milk there?
-No, it's, er... rather
a large gin, actually.

34:39.797 --> 34:42.259
-Is it?
-Oh, Jess...

34:42.342 --> 34:44.971
You know you're always
very welcome to stay
at Glenbogle,

34:45.054 --> 34:48.976
and I'm really thrilled
to see you so happy...

34:49.478 --> 34:51.147
But?

34:51.230 --> 34:53.650
Don't overlook what your
father might be feeling.

34:53.734 --> 34:55.945
It isn't easy for
a parent to let go.

35:13.887 --> 35:16.390
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

35:22.398 --> 35:24.860
Oh! (LAUGHING)

35:27.489 --> 35:30.494
Turn the light off,
I can't take it.

35:30.577 --> 35:33.998
-Here, let me give you a hand.
-(GROANING)

35:35.167 --> 35:37.460
Ah, it's been
a hell of a night.

35:37.546 --> 35:39.840
I must reek like a brewery.

35:39.923 --> 35:43.095
Let's get these wheels off
and get you up on bricks.

35:46.224 --> 35:48.269
You smell of fresh air.

35:48.351 --> 35:50.938
I was on the vodka.

35:51.021 --> 35:52.650
Duncan...

35:54.277 --> 35:56.488
You're stone-cold sober!
(EXCLAIMING)

36:02.079 --> 36:04.708
It didn't quite work
out as planned.

36:04.791 --> 36:07.504
You don't have to pretend
to be drunk to impress me.

36:07.588 --> 36:10.425
In fact, I think that might
be a first for the human race.

36:23.151 --> 36:27.991
-Specky Duff's got my MacBoy.
-Maybe his mummy'll
send him round with it, eh?

36:32.998 --> 36:34.333
We can't do any
of the preparations in here,

36:34.416 --> 36:35.585
Molly'll find out
straight away.

36:35.668 --> 36:36.961
I get the day off, then!

36:37.045 --> 36:38.839
You can go to the party.
Have a good time.

36:38.923 --> 36:41.510
I don't think so, thanks.
Just a wee bit outside
my age range.

36:41.593 --> 36:45.015
I'll tell you what you can do.
You can look after Donald.

36:45.098 --> 36:47.267
No, that's not
in my job description.

36:47.351 --> 36:52.024
You haven't got one.
You are an employee,
you haven't booked leave.

36:52.107 --> 36:54.736
-You're on guard duty.
-That's not fair.

36:54.820 --> 36:56.113
Tell it to the tribunal.

37:03.374 --> 37:05.919
Let the arrangement stand,
Paul.

37:06.002 --> 37:07.379
Let the wolf go.

37:08.172 --> 37:09.215
We don't have to.

37:09.298 --> 37:11.468
Look, forget about
the background.

37:11.552 --> 37:14.430
We decide what's best
right now.

37:14.514 --> 37:15.850
We're both grown-ups.

37:15.933 --> 37:17.978
We're making the right
decision, Paul,
for the estate.

37:19.396 --> 37:20.690
That's our only concern.

37:27.616 --> 37:28.701
What?

37:28.784 --> 37:29.869
What?

37:33.249 --> 37:35.294
Happy birthday, Molly!

37:35.377 --> 37:38.298
-Thank you.
-Oh, yeah, happy birthday.

37:38.381 --> 37:41.719
-Oh, thank you.
-See? No fuss.

37:41.802 --> 37:43.513
-Quiet day.
-Just like you wanted.

37:44.264 --> 37:45.266
Lovely.

38:01.622 --> 38:04.918
-What a fool.
-Sorry?

38:05.002 --> 38:09.633
Selfish, self-centred,
maudlin, and in dire need
of a good smacking.

38:09.716 --> 38:12.345
-Who might that be?
-Me.

38:12.428 --> 38:15.058
-I am so ungrateful.
-The party?

38:15.141 --> 38:18.062
I feel just like an old,
wet blanket.

38:18.145 --> 38:19.813
Have you been talking
to anyone about this?

38:19.897 --> 38:23.569
I am still capable of
changing my own mind,
even at 60.

38:23.653 --> 38:25.864
Shame, not much we
can do about it, now.

38:28.743 --> 38:32.874
Well, I suppose I could ring
round a few places, you know,

38:32.958 --> 38:34.334
see if I can get
a table for dinner.

38:34.417 --> 38:37.255
-Yeah, that'd be nice.
Just the three of us.
-Mmm.

38:38.590 --> 38:41.844
-No, no, don't bother.
-LEXIE: No bother!

38:41.928 --> 38:43.722
-Is it, Paul?
-No.

38:48.104 --> 38:49.814
Sausage!

38:49.897 --> 38:50.983
Bacon!

39:01.080 --> 39:04.501
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
-Aha, just the man.

39:04.585 --> 39:05.753
Eyes closed.

39:07.463 --> 39:08.716
Now...

39:10.260 --> 39:12.053
-Ladle...
-(LAUGHING)

39:14.432 --> 39:16.768
-Well?
-Delicious.

39:16.852 --> 39:20.608
-Thank you. Do you think
there's enough booze in it?
-Uh-huh.

39:28.285 --> 39:30.997
The wolf's in the crate
and they're ready to go.

39:32.373 --> 39:34.168
I'd like you to be there.

39:36.713 --> 39:37.965
Okay.

39:50.983 --> 39:54.947
Yes, it's a hard life indeed,
as your gran knew well enough.

39:55.031 --> 39:58.535
-I think I'm across
that one, thanks.
-Maybe.

39:58.619 --> 40:00.914
But she wouldn't have been
sat there with all this
work to be done,

40:00.997 --> 40:02.792
staring at the scenery
like a tourist.

40:04.085 --> 40:07.297
I am a tourist,
that's the problem.

40:07.381 --> 40:10.010
I'm not a farmer,
I'm a city girl.

40:10.094 --> 40:12.597
-That's where I belong.
-Nonsense.

40:12.681 --> 40:16.519
Anyway, if you did go,
who's going to look after
these two reprobates?

40:20.108 --> 40:21.109
(PIGS GRUNTING)

40:22.611 --> 40:24.905
-Where were they?
-Eating my cabbages.

40:26.032 --> 40:27.827
Sorry about that.

40:31.081 --> 40:35.087
Unfortunately,
the cavalry have arrived
just a bit too late.

40:35.170 --> 40:39.050
The guy's gone
who was going
to...deal with them.

40:39.134 --> 40:42.764
Are you Kate Anderson's
granddaughter or are you not?

40:42.848 --> 40:47.186
Time you took a leaf out
of your gran's book, lassie,
and became a real farmer.

40:51.443 --> 40:53.195
That's great. Thanks.

40:56.074 --> 40:57.869
Goodbye, Moonshadow.

40:57.952 --> 40:59.120
(WHINING)

40:59.203 --> 41:00.831

41:36.673 --> 41:38.008
(WOLF WHINES)

41:56.325 --> 41:59.663
Yep, your gran got her meat
from the butchers,

41:59.746 --> 42:01.541
and her bread from
the bakers in the village.

42:01.624 --> 42:03.919
Not the bread she supplied
to the big house?

42:04.003 --> 42:06.715
-She just took the wrappers
off and doubled the price.
-She never!

42:06.798 --> 42:09.552
The MacDonalds had exploited
the Andersons for centuries...

42:09.635 --> 42:12.598
She just... evened it up
a wee bitty.

Hold it right there,
Donald MacDonald.

I'll go mad if I have to spend
another day in this hell-hole.

42:52.905 --> 42:55.825
I've detailed Ewan here
to keep an eye on you tonight.

42:55.909 --> 42:57.285
Confined to barracks?

42:57.369 --> 43:00.123
It is better than being
confined to a police cell.

43:11.931 --> 43:13.684
Isn't she lovely still?

43:19.191 --> 43:21.653
Come on, Don,
we know where
we're not wanted.

Oh, that's a hard word, Ewan.

45:05.507 --> 45:10.723
It's perfectly natural
that Paul should want
to curb the competition.

-I knew it.
-You can't leave me, Ewan.

45:13.685 --> 45:16.522
You know I might escape.

I beg you.

just as frequently
as at yours,

but for subtly
different reasons.

47:01.878 --> 47:04.381
I'll go and let him out.
Maybe he needs
a bathroom break.

47:47.609 --> 47:49.486
Uncle!

47:49.569 --> 47:51.697
Donald!

47:51.781 --> 47:55.161
Damnable modern rubbish.
Biscuit tins on castors.

47:55.245 --> 47:57.080
Shabby handling,
shoddy brakes.

47:57.163 --> 47:59.667
What the hell
are you playing at?

47:59.750 --> 48:02.839
You can't hate Glenbogle
that much you'd rather
be dead or in prison!

48:11.308 --> 48:12.811
Donald...

48:15.940 --> 48:17.985
We need to be able
to trust each other.

48:22.240 --> 48:24.076
Very well.

48:24.160 --> 48:28.040
I'll make no further escape
attempts and you will allow me
the freedoms

48:28.124 --> 48:30.586
becoming my position
and years, eh?

48:33.256 --> 48:35.342
I want to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

48:37.011 --> 48:38.972
You asked why
I was so desperate
to get away.

48:40.475 --> 48:42.519
You take it as
a mark of good faith.

48:45.815 --> 48:47.233
Trust.

48:49.904 --> 48:52.449
Trust.

48:52.533 --> 48:56.705
Come on, I'll give you a lift
back to the house.

48:59.083 --> 49:01.253
Paul...

49:01.337 --> 49:04.758
It's such a lovely evening,
I think I'll walk.

49:10.058 --> 49:13.229
Well, er, I'll see you
back there, then.

49:28.208 --> 49:31.087
Do you ever wish
you could just start
all over again?

49:34.216 --> 49:37.178
Good old Specky.
Makes me feel
like an achiever.

49:38.931 --> 49:40.350
Are you all right, Nigel?

49:42.310 --> 49:44.522
Sorry, Duncan,
got a bit carried away.

49:44.605 --> 49:48.820
Nah, never mind, you should
save your pocket money,
though, buy your own one.

49:48.903 --> 49:54.244
Ah, no, I wrote the software
for Mac Boy. Just never get
time to play the bloody thing!

49:54.327 --> 49:55.496
Good to see you, Dunc.

50:26.664 --> 50:29.001
This is why Donald's been
so desperate to leave,

50:29.084 --> 50:32.840
but he's agreed to give it
a go and stay here instead.

50:32.924 --> 50:36.428
I'm not surprised. The flight
leaves in under an hour.

50:36.512 --> 50:38.681
This is as worthless
as the man himself.

50:41.143 --> 50:46.400
The fugitive is a white male,
aged approximately 60 years,
wearing, um...

50:47.903 --> 50:49.863
A white cricket jumper.

50:49.947 --> 50:55.497
A white cricket jumper,
bow tie and brown corduroys.

51:00.796 --> 51:04.425
And winkle-picker
cowboy boots.

51:06.554 --> 51:10.393
-Donald...
-We said trust, dear boy,

51:10.476 --> 51:13.188
and it hasn't even
extended until midnight.

51:13.272 --> 51:15.859
I jumped to
the wrong conclusions.

51:15.942 --> 51:18.529
-Forgive me.
-I absolve you.

51:18.612 --> 51:21.658
-And the deal stands?
-Oh, yes...

51:23.870 --> 51:25.164
Until it falls.

51:28.960 --> 51:33.091
# Happy birthday, dear Molly

51:33.175 --> 51:36.387
# Happy birthday to you #

51:36.470 --> 51:38.056
-(ALL APPLAUDING)
-MOLLY: Thank you.

51:40.894 --> 51:42.855
MOLLY:
What a wonderful surprise!

51:52.367 --> 51:54.370
-Ours, I think.
-I think not.

51:58.210 --> 52:00.171
Golly, will you dance with me?

52:14.524 --> 52:16.735
Look at me.

52:16.818 --> 52:21.825
So you're not making
those noisy little computer
games for telephones.

52:21.909 --> 52:25.748
You're a good man, Duncan,
and that's rare enough.

52:42.104 --> 52:44.107
-That's so beautiful.
-Awesome.

52:52.744 --> 52:55.957
-Great night. Well done.
-Well done, you.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.543
Teamwork.
