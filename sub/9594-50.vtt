WEBVTT

00:29.197 --> 00:31.165
Whoo-hoo! Yay!

00:33.134 --> 00:35.069
-Titans! Crime alert!

00:35.636 --> 00:37.471
Yeah, so call the police.

00:37.505 --> 00:41.242
I believe the number
is nine and the one
and the one

00:41.275 --> 00:42.176
in that order.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.777
You don't understand.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.045
It's Slade.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.216
-Slade!

00:49.617 --> 00:51.752
That's right. Slade.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.527
Our greatest villain has
returned to settle the score.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.262
Are we ready for this?

01:01.295 --> 01:03.831
I don't know,
but we have no choice.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.433
Titans, go!

01:07.635 --> 01:11.205
Whoo-hoo! I can't believe
what just happened!

01:11.239 --> 01:12.706
The menace known as Slade

01:12.740 --> 01:15.109
has been vanquished
once and for all!

01:15.143 --> 01:16.477
Oh, yeah!

01:19.447 --> 01:21.182
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

01:21.215 --> 01:23.284
And it wasn't just
the fight that was amazing,

01:23.317 --> 01:26.220
in the end, so many
compelling storylines
came together

01:26.254 --> 01:28.489
and resolved in such
a satisfying way!

01:28.522 --> 01:31.392
A perfect balance
of the action and drama.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.861
Along with light moments
of the comedy!

01:33.894 --> 01:37.265
-And I finally got that kiss!

01:37.298 --> 01:39.367
Well, it's too bad people
will never see any of it.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.635
No! That's a good thing, bro.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.771
It was just too epic!

01:43.804 --> 01:46.174
You know what, Titans?
After saving the world,

01:46.207 --> 01:48.309
I think we've
earned ourselves a party!

01:50.244 --> 01:51.812
Whipped cream!

01:51.845 --> 01:53.281
Oh, whoo!

01:53.314 --> 01:54.682
We'll have food, dancing,

01:54.715 --> 01:56.817
and any type of entertainment
you guys want!

01:56.850 --> 01:59.553
A DJ Magician?
You name it!

01:59.587 --> 02:01.789
A clown!

02:01.822 --> 02:02.723
What?

02:02.756 --> 02:06.327
-We said...
-BOTH: A clown!

02:06.360 --> 02:08.329
Please, what is the clown?

02:08.362 --> 02:10.130
This is a clown, Star.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.271
What do they do?
What do they do?

02:18.572 --> 02:20.174
Well, they entertain
small children.

02:20.208 --> 02:23.911
Who would let
such a creature near a child?

02:23.944 --> 02:27.281
No, Star.
Clowns are the coolest!

02:27.315 --> 02:29.950
Yeah! We loved clowns
since we were kids!

02:29.983 --> 02:33.221
So cool, and they
have that great music!

02:40.694 --> 02:43.264
When I hear that,
I know it means good times!

02:43.297 --> 02:44.732
Or the ice cream truck.

02:44.765 --> 02:48.236
-So, yeah, clowns.
-We haven't seen one in years!

02:48.269 --> 02:50.271
Yeah, clowns are great

02:50.304 --> 02:51.071
for little kids!

02:51.104 --> 02:52.940
You guys are
too old for clowns.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.976
Oh, yeah? How's Season Six
of Pretty, Pretty Pegasus?

02:56.009 --> 02:58.246
Oh, my gosh! Well,
Butterbean and Sparkleface

02:58.279 --> 03:01.282
have to save King Jellybean
who has been frozen
in cake frosting

03:01.315 --> 03:03.217
-and...

03:03.251 --> 03:05.253
That's completely different.

03:05.286 --> 03:08.756
So I'm really
going to hire a clown?

03:08.789 --> 03:10.591
Oh, no, no! No, no, please!

03:10.624 --> 03:12.326
Please, do not do it!

03:12.360 --> 03:13.594
I beg of you!

03:13.627 --> 03:15.396
A clown!

03:17.698 --> 03:19.300
A clown it is.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.408
Attention, Titans.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.776
I know we're all
having a good time

03:28.809 --> 03:31.945
but the
clown is here.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.790
-Oh, yeah!

03:42.823 --> 03:45.326
This is gonna be so good!

03:46.860 --> 03:47.861
Ow!

03:55.836 --> 03:58.739
Wait a minute.
This clown is horrible!

03:58.772 --> 04:01.309
Yeah. Why you doing
lame kiddy stuff?

04:02.242 --> 04:05.413
I told you,
you're too old for clowns.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.780
No, it's him!

04:06.814 --> 04:09.049
This is not the way
we remember his act!

04:09.082 --> 04:11.419
Guys, this is a classic
clown act!

04:11.452 --> 04:13.521
Look at the shoes,
the nose, the makeup.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.789
No way! This clown
is for kids!

04:15.823 --> 04:17.725
Yes! Clowns are for kids!

04:17.758 --> 04:19.893
When I was a kid,
clowns were way cooler!

04:19.927 --> 04:22.396
They had depth and meaning!

04:22.430 --> 04:23.931
This clown is garbage.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.066
Kids today don't know
what they're missing.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.801
You know,
maybe we can fix him.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.403
Make him as cool
as he used to be.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.971
Clowns were never cool.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.840
You're letting nostalgia
cloud your memory.

04:32.873 --> 04:37.678
Guys. Kids' entertainment
is not something
to be messed with.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.046
It's sacred.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.714
I worry that
altering this clown

04:40.748 --> 04:42.816
could have
disastrous consequences!

04:42.850 --> 04:46.053
Sorry, mama, but we're
making this clown cool again.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.823
Man, look at this clown!

04:49.857 --> 04:51.625
I know. He looks like
some kind of clown!

04:51.659 --> 04:53.327
What a disgrace.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.895
But we'll just dress him up
like we remember him.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.465
I don't really remember
what he looked like, bro.

04:57.498 --> 04:58.666
Just that he was cool!

04:58.699 --> 05:00.501
Then let's make him cool!

05:00.534 --> 05:02.403
With science!

05:02.436 --> 05:03.704
Just sign this here waiver

05:03.737 --> 05:05.105
stating that we can do
anything we want

05:05.138 --> 05:07.508
to your mind, body,
and spiritual being.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.477
-BEAST BOY: Thanks, bro.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.552
The clown's gone, Star.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.753
It's safe to come out.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.424
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.525
You guys!

05:57.558 --> 05:59.827
We made our clown cool again!

05:59.860 --> 06:01.395
Keep him away from me!

06:02.563 --> 06:03.731
Check it!

06:21.014 --> 06:23.083
Doesn't look very funny to me.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.118
Oh, yeah?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.587
Do your act, yo.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.191
Ahhh!

06:31.224 --> 06:32.860
The clown is
trying to kill me!

06:34.562 --> 06:35.763
It burns!

06:40.768 --> 06:43.537
Oh, it's like a pie
to the face! But cooler!

06:44.672 --> 06:47.575
Told you, clowns are funny!

06:47.608 --> 06:50.010
Guys! This is wrong!

06:50.043 --> 06:51.912
Okay, it's a little funny.

06:51.945 --> 06:55.082
But still wrong!
You've taken something
that's meant to be for kids

06:55.115 --> 06:56.817
and made it
totally inappropriate

06:56.850 --> 06:58.118
just so you can
still enjoy something

06:58.151 --> 06:59.553
you should have outgrown!

06:59.587 --> 07:01.221
We just made him
like we remember!

07:01.254 --> 07:02.923
And now,
we're gonna release him

07:02.956 --> 07:05.826
so he can spread joy
to all the kids in the world!

07:05.859 --> 07:07.561
RAVEN: That clown's
not for children.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.096
And I'm worried
what the influence
of something like that

07:09.129 --> 07:10.531
could have on
all kids' entertainment!

07:10.564 --> 07:13.066
What? You worried
it's gonna make it better?

07:14.502 --> 07:18.506
Yo, clownie! Get out of here
and go make some kids happy!

07:29.617 --> 07:32.452
Time for the latest episode
of Pretty, Pretty Pegasus!

07:35.656 --> 07:37.758
King Jellybean
has betrayed us!

07:37.791 --> 07:39.827
We may never eat candy again.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.630
I don't want any filthy candy!

07:42.663 --> 07:44.565
I just want blood!

07:50.604 --> 07:52.973
What is this?

07:53.006 --> 07:54.875
This is supposed
to be a kids' show!

07:54.908 --> 07:56.209
What's happened?

07:57.745 --> 07:59.647
Ha, ha, ha!

07:59.680 --> 08:01.682
The clown.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.852
ROBIN: How dastardly!

08:38.886 --> 08:40.621
If that clown has his way,

08:40.654 --> 08:42.690
all children's entertainment
will be tainted!

08:42.723 --> 08:46.627
I guess we lost sight
of what made clowns cool
in the first place,

08:46.660 --> 08:48.929
as being age-appropriate
entertainment.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.599
We can't hold on
to our childhood forever.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.166
Things change.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.603
Well, it's time to grow up.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.638
Are we going in guns blazing?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.172
No. The only way to stop him

08:59.206 --> 09:01.642
is to remind him
of who he truly is.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.010
Titans, go!

09:32.973 --> 09:35.643
Ow! Ow! Ow!

09:47.154 --> 09:49.857
It's working!
Now, for the big finish!

10:00.768 --> 10:02.703
Thanks for the laughs, Titans.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.673
This was
a horrible plan, Raven.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.740
Why did you think
this would work?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.978
Children's entertainment
is doomed!

10:14.982 --> 10:16.283
Starfire?

10:16.316 --> 10:19.753
I will never trust the clowns.
