00:06.840 --> 00:09.592
Leslie:
<i>I want you to know that
I'm not angry with you.</i>

00:09.676 --> 00:13.263
- Rue: Angry?
- Leslie: Yes, I'm not angry with you. I love you.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.014
Rue:
What are you talking about?

00:15.098 --> 00:18.476
Leslie:
I know you're doin' drugs again.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.605
Rue:
What? Did Gia say
something about this?!

00:22.689 --> 00:25.024
Really?!
You're gonna rat me
out to fuckin' Mom

00:25.108 --> 00:26.735
over smokin' a little
bit of fuckin' weed?!

00:26.735 --> 00:28.278
- Is that what the fuck we're doing now?
- Gia: What're you talking about?

00:28.278 --> 00:29.654
- I didn't rat you out!
- I knew I never should've

00:29.738 --> 00:30.864
- fuckin' trusted you!
- Gia: I didn't say anything!

00:30.864 --> 00:32.031
Rue:
Then what is
she talking about?!

00:32.115 --> 00:32.907
Leslie: Wait, wait, wait!

00:32.991 --> 00:34.033
We're you doin' drugs with Gia?

00:34.117 --> 00:35.702
- No!
- Gia: What? I--

00:35.702 --> 00:37.871
- Rue, I didn't say anything!
- Then how the fuck does she know?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.581
- What is she talking about?!
- Leslie: Gia, you knew this?

00:39.581 --> 00:42.167
- You knew she was doin' drugs?
- Gia: It's not like that.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.960
Okay, you know what?
If you wanna fuckin' consider

00:43.960 --> 00:47.213
smoking some weed
to help with my fucking
panic attacks doing drugs

00:47.297 --> 00:49.674
then, yeah, sure, whatever.
I was doin' fuckin' drugs.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.468
Gimme a fuckin' break.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.969
You knew?

00:52.969 --> 00:55.263
- Don't slam my door!
- Gia: Mom!

00:55.263 --> 00:57.223
Please tell her
I didn't say anything--

00:57.307 --> 00:59.100
Can you guys
chill the fuck out?
It's just weed.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.727
Leslie:
I'm not talkin'
about weed, Rue.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.353
I'm talkin' about pills.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.650
- What?
- Leslie: I'm talking about opiates.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.446
I'm not doin' opiates, Mom.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.448
- When did you start doing pills?
- Leslie: Gia!

01:13.448 --> 01:14.657
Rue: I didn't.
I fuckin' didn't!

01:14.741 --> 01:15.617
- I told you--
- Gia--

01:15.617 --> 01:17.327
I thought it wasn't
a good idea--

01:17.327 --> 01:18.745
Gia, please!

01:18.745 --> 01:20.747
Let me handle this!
Go to your room!

01:20.747 --> 01:22.916
- Fuck it.
- Yeah, fuck it!

01:22.916 --> 01:24.793
Rue:
If you wanna drug test me,
let's just do it.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.754
- I don't want to drug test you.
- Okay, so then, what?

01:27.754 --> 01:30.465
- You just wanna fuckin' accuse me of shit?
- I'm not accusing you, baby.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.342
- Okay? But I know--
- If you're so fuckin' sure, let's do it!

01:32.342 --> 01:35.386
Come on, let's go.
Let's fuckin' drug test me.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.681
I don't need to.
Jules told me everything.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.073
The fuck did you do, Mom?

01:55.073 --> 01:57.617
- Fuck! What did you do, Mom?
- Baby, please. Baby, please listen to me, okay?

01:57.617 --> 01:59.661
- Fuck. What did you do with the fuckin' suitcase?!
- Please, it's gonna be okay!

01:59.661 --> 02:01.037
- It's gonna be okay!
- What did you do with the fuckin' suitcase?!

02:01.037 --> 02:02.413
- Baby, it's gonna be okay!
- No, it's not

02:02.497 --> 02:03.790
gonna be fuckin' okay!
You don't know--

02:03.790 --> 02:05.750
Fuck!
It wasn't mine!

02:05.834 --> 02:08.211
- Then whose is it? Huh?!
- Fuck! Fuck!

02:08.211 --> 02:09.379
Okay, look, look.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.089
We can go
to the hospital, okay?

02:11.089 --> 02:13.049
I'm not goin'
to a fuckin' hospital!
If you call--

02:13.049 --> 02:15.093
- Mom, Mom--
- Look, we can do the withdrawal thing

02:15.093 --> 02:17.178
- again, baby. It's okay.
- Don't call... the fuckin' hospital.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.388
If you try to put me
in a fuckin' hospital,

02:18.388 --> 02:19.764
I swear to God,
we're gonna have
a problem.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.099
- Rue, no, you're out of control.
- Put the phone down.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.184
Put the fucking--
Put the fucking phone down!

02:23.268 --> 02:25.144
Where did you put it?
Where'd you put my pills, Mom?

02:25.228 --> 02:26.688
- Where did you put it?!
- You're in my way.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.106
- Get outta my way. I'm callin' the police.
- Mom!

02:28.106 --> 02:29.524
- No, you can't. You can't do that.
- Yes!

02:29.524 --> 02:30.859
You will not attack me
in my own home--

02:30.859 --> 02:32.402
I'll do whatever the fuck
I want in your own home!

02:32.402 --> 02:33.820
I raised you!

02:34.779 --> 02:35.905
I did, okay?!

02:35.989 --> 02:38.032
And you do not
fuckin' scare me!

02:50.253 --> 02:52.088
You're not
a good person, Rue.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.140
You smilin'?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.850
Really?
You're proud of that?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.356
You know
what's a shame, Mom?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.861
My dad's dead.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.489
Kinda keeps you from
admitting what a shit
fuckin' mother you are.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.076
"Oh, poor Leslie.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.244
"Her daughter's
an addict,

03:23.328 --> 03:25.371
but, you know,
her dad did die."

03:26.372 --> 03:27.707
You hear that, Gia?!

03:28.708 --> 03:30.460
You hear that?

03:30.460 --> 03:32.128
I don't wanna put too
much pressure on you,

03:32.128 --> 03:33.546
but you're probably
gonna have to be

03:33.630 --> 03:36.466
a fuckin' neurosurgeon,
or maybe an astronaut

03:36.466 --> 03:38.927
because if not,
then Mom is
0 for fuckin' 2,

03:38.927 --> 03:40.762
and that means that
it might, actually,

03:40.762 --> 03:42.555
- just be her fuckin' fault.
- Gia: Rue, stop!

03:42.639 --> 03:45.767
Yeah, that means, maybe,
she, actually, fucked up!

03:45.767 --> 03:47.143
- Okay, that's enough, Rue.
- Rue: To be fuckin' honest.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.895
- That's enough.
- Don't fuckin' touch me!

03:48.895 --> 03:50.229
Don't fuckin' touch me!
You wanna hit me?

03:50.313 --> 03:51.773
- Gia: Shut the fuck up!
- Do it. Hit me!

03:51.773 --> 03:53.900
- You're fucking--
- I know you want to. Get the fuck off of me!

03:53.900 --> 03:55.068
Don't you fuckin' touch her!

03:55.068 --> 03:56.444
Ow!

03:56.444 --> 03:58.446
Get out!
Get the fuck outta here!

03:58.446 --> 04:00.239
- Get off of me!
- Get your--

04:02.867 --> 04:05.620
Rue: Where are my fuckin' pills?!

04:06.537 --> 04:08.289
What did you do?!

04:11.960 --> 04:13.670
Rue: Where are they?!

04:18.341 --> 04:20.593
You wanna tell me
what to do with
my fuckin' life, huh?!

04:20.677 --> 04:22.387
You wanna tell me
to stop doin' drugs?!

04:26.766 --> 04:29.811
Huh, what the fuck else
am I supposed to do, huh?!

04:29.811 --> 04:31.771
What do you
want me to do?!

04:31.771 --> 04:34.440
- What do you want me to fuckin' do?!
- Rue, please!

04:34.524 --> 04:35.984
This is your
fuckin' fault!

04:35.984 --> 04:39.028
You don't fuckin' recognize me?
Well, neither do fuckin' I!

04:39.112 --> 04:41.322
I don't fuckin'
recognize me either!

04:42.281 --> 04:44.325
Where did you put it?

04:44.409 --> 04:47.328
You wish I was different?!
So do I!

04:47.412 --> 04:50.164
You fucking hate me?!
So do I!

04:50.248 --> 04:51.833
Where did you fucking put them?!

04:51.833 --> 04:55.044
Fuck! Where'd you put it?

04:55.128 --> 04:56.921
Where's the fuckin' suitcase?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.383
Fuck.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.428
Where did you put it? Fuck.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.221
Where did you put
the fuckin' pills?

05:05.221 --> 05:08.266
Where did you
put the pills?!

05:08.266 --> 05:11.352
Where did you put them, Mom?

05:35.418 --> 05:39.213
You, you don't understand, Mom.
It's not my suitcase.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.509
It's not mine.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.805
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.935
I want to get clean.
I can't do it.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.065
And I just--
I don't wanna
be here anymore.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.570
I'm sor-- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

06:04.822 --> 06:08.493
I, I just--
I don't know what to do.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.913
I'm, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Gia.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.165
I, I didn't,
I didn't mean to.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.836
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.631
I'm sorry.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.510
I'm sorry, but I need you
to tell me where they are.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.096
I need you to tell me
where the pills are, Mom.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.306
I need you to tell me
where the suitcase is.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.441
Tell me where they are, Mom!

06:40.525 --> 06:42.151
Fuck! Aah!

06:44.028 --> 06:46.030
Where did you fucking put them?!

06:47.782 --> 06:50.576
I know they're
fuckin' in here, Mom!
I know they're in here!

06:50.660 --> 06:54.163
What did you do with them?!
What did you do?!

06:55.373 --> 06:57.708
Where the fuck are they?

06:57.792 --> 07:00.711
What did you do with them?

07:00.795 --> 07:02.672
Jules:
We flushed 'em down the toilet.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.850
Leslie:
You look embarrassed, Rue.

07:13.850 --> 07:17.103
You embarrassed 'cause Jules
just heard everything you said?

07:19.480 --> 07:23.401
Don't cry. Own that shit.
Own what you just said.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.070
Fuck you.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.725
Oh, okay.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.690
I see what the fuck
is goin' on here.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.529
Well, first
thing's first,

08:08.613 --> 08:10.865
Elliot here is
a fuckin' addict...

08:10.865 --> 08:12.366
so if he
tells you anything
fuckin' different,

08:12.450 --> 08:14.493
he's a liar
and a fucking snake.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.995
Fuck you!

08:15.995 --> 08:17.371
- He cares about you--
- Fuckin' bitch.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.956
This doesn't fucking
concern you, Jules.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.374
- Yes, it does--
- No the fuck it doesn't!

08:20.458 --> 08:22.001
- Yes, it does.
- How?!

08:22.001 --> 08:24.462
'Cause I don't want you
to kill yourself.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.757
- You're a fucking rat!
- Jules: You were lying to me.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.426
Rue:
Yeah, so you go
tell my fuckin' Mom?!

08:30.426 --> 08:32.511
Jules:
I didn't know what else to do.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.183
And why the fuck
would you say anything?

08:52.156 --> 08:53.908
You are fuckin' dead to me.

08:56.535 --> 09:01.749
- You don't mean that.
- I fucking mean every fucking word.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.293
- You're dead to me, Jules.
- I don't believe you.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.420
You and me,
we're fuckin' done.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.924
There's nothing
fuckin' there anymore.

09:11.634 --> 09:16.222
Nothing... Fucking... There.

09:17.682 --> 09:21.310
You know, I have a lot
of regrets... in my life.

09:23.854 --> 09:27.775
But I gotta tell you,
Jules, meeting you,

09:27.775 --> 09:32.780
has got to be at the top
of my fuckin' list.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.491
Oh, now you wanna
fuckin' cry?

09:36.534 --> 09:38.661
Now you wanna
fuckin' cry?

09:39.704 --> 09:42.498
Yeah, you're
a fucking vampire.

09:44.542 --> 09:49.505
You just go around fuckin'
sucking the fucking spirit
out of everyone!

09:51.215 --> 09:53.843
You like that shit...
makes you feel good.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.220
- You know that's not true.
- Rue: It is fuckin' true.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.431
It's all about
fuckin' Jules, right?

09:58.431 --> 09:59.724
And you don't know
what the fuck you're doing.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.809
You just act all
fuckin' innocent,

10:01.809 --> 10:03.394
like you're this fuckin'
sweet little angel,

10:03.394 --> 10:04.895
this innocent, sweet,
little fuckin' angel

10:04.979 --> 10:06.063
who doesn't know what
the fuck they're doing.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.190
You know what
the fuck you're doing!

10:09.734 --> 10:11.694
- Jules: I love you.
- No the fuck you don't.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.738
You love being loved!

10:14.739 --> 10:16.240
You're a fuckin'
greedy whore

10:16.324 --> 10:19.410
who just likes sucking
the life out of people.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.495
And it fucking hurts, Jules!

10:23.372 --> 10:25.249
- I love you.
- Rue: No, you don't.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.586
Stop saying that!
You don't love me!

10:31.172 --> 10:32.923
You fuckin' left me...

10:34.508 --> 10:36.635
when I fuckin' needed you.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.554
You fuckin' left me...

10:38.554 --> 10:43.059
when I was at my fuckin' lo--

10:43.059 --> 10:46.354
You fuckin' left me
at my fucking lowest!

10:46.354 --> 10:48.773
And a real fuckin' friend,
someone who fuckin' loves you,

10:48.773 --> 10:50.733
wouldn't do some
shit like that, Jules!

10:53.319 --> 10:55.529
I love you
and I want to help you.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.239
Rue:
If you wanna help me,

10:57.323 --> 10:58.741
uh, you can honestly,

10:58.741 --> 11:00.701
you can just stay out
of my fuckin' life...

11:00.785 --> 11:01.911
forever.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.204
That would be great
because, honestly,

11:03.204 --> 11:05.956
looking at you makes me
physically fucking ill!

11:14.840 --> 11:17.051
- I'm sorry, baby.
- Jules: Okay.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.725
Elliot:
I shouldn't have
said anything.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.940
I liked Rue
the way she was.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.363
And this shit
was never my place.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.085
Rue:
I feel like
I'm going crazy, Mom.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.712
- I feel like I'm going crazy.
- Look...

11:53.796 --> 11:55.589
- I wanna take you to the ER, okay?
- Okay.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.758
- Okay. They can-- No.
- I'm sorry.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.760
Leslie:
They can help
you detox, okay?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.971
Rue:
Mom, I'm sorry for what I said.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.305
I am.
Please, forgive me.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.558
Leslie:
I don't care
about that, Rue.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.185
I'm sorry.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.480
- I just miss Dad.
- Leslie: Me too, baby, me too.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.024
- I miss him a lot.
- Leslie: I know.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.234
Me too.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.874
Oh god.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.375
Leslie: Baby...

12:32.751 --> 12:33.836
listen.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.923
Can I take you
to the hospital?

12:38.924 --> 12:41.177
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.707
You want shotgun?

14:13.102 --> 14:15.020
Rue:
You wanna know the truth?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.317
I relapsed as soon
as I got out of rehab.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.999
Leslie:
...thinkin' about that
right now, okay?

14:34.999 --> 14:36.667
Let's just get you
back into rehab.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.711
Rue:
Wait, what, what the fuck
you talking about, Mom?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.462
I thought you said we
were going to the ER.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.131
Leslie:
Yeah, baby,
it's the same thing.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.216
Rue:
No, it's not the fuckin'
same thing, Mom.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.936
Five percent, okay?

14:56.020 --> 14:58.022
Those are
my fucking chances,
one in 20.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.941
Leslie:
All I know, if you
set your mind to it,

15:01.025 --> 15:03.444
your chances are higher
than five percent.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.904
Yeah, well, everybody's Mom
fuckin' says that, okay?

15:05.988 --> 15:08.073
Even the ones
who bury their kids.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.415
It's funny 'cause...
if you guys didn't do

15:16.415 --> 15:18.334
this fuckin' intervention shit,

15:18.334 --> 15:21.420
I was about a month away
from killing myself.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.964
I have this
image in my head

15:24.048 --> 15:29.511
of me just, you know,
layin' in the sand,
and...

15:29.595 --> 15:34.266
lettin' the wave just
kind of take me out to sea.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.478
Ugh, fuck.
Mom, I can't do this.
I can't, I can't do this.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.521
- You guys need to let me out of this car.
- I don't care--

15:39.605 --> 15:41.565
Rue:
I don't wanna fuckin' do this!

15:45.611 --> 15:46.862
Leslie:
It's okay, baby,
we're almost there, okay?

15:46.862 --> 15:48.530
Rue:
It's not fuckin' okay, Mom!

15:48.614 --> 15:50.199
Leslie:
Just-- Rue! Rue!

15:50.199 --> 15:52.117
Can't do this. I'm sorry, Mom, I can't.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.661
- I can't do it.
- Leslie: Rue, get back in the car!

15:53.661 --> 15:54.745
- Rue!
- Oh my gosh!

16:00.042 --> 16:01.418
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

16:01.502 --> 16:03.295
Mom, Mom, go get her!

16:12.930 --> 16:14.973
Mom, go!

16:15.057 --> 16:17.017
Fuck, fuck!
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop!

16:19.812 --> 16:20.729
Rue!

16:23.524 --> 16:24.483
Fuck.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.582
<i>♪ Praise the Lord ♪</i>

17:11.780 --> 17:12.865
Fez!

18:29.316 --> 18:31.401
Ah, fuck.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.490
- Hey.
- Hey, are you okay?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.575
Mm-hm. I think I just have,
like, a cold or something.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.494
Okay, well,
don't get me sick
'cause I have rehearsal.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.578
I can't,
I can't get you sick.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.163
Okay, well, colds
are contagious, so--

18:43.247 --> 18:44.498
Rue:
Yeah, I realize that,
but it's just--

18:44.498 --> 18:45.833
It's not that
kind of thing.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.626
Can I use your
bathroom, please?

18:47.626 --> 18:50.546
- Hey, Rue!
- Oh, hi.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.840
- Hey, oh. Oh, yeah.
- Hey.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.801
Oh my god.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.511
Hey, Rue.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.555
Oh, jeez.
Are you feelin' okay?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.932
- Rue: Yeah.
- You look terrible.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.101
- Rue: Yeah--
- I mean, really terrible.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.186
Yeah, I think I just have,
like, a cold or something.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.857
Well, don't get me sick.
I have a compromised
immune system.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.525
But otherwise,
are you doin' okay?

19:11.525 --> 19:13.443
- Uh-huh.
- How's your mom?

19:13.527 --> 19:16.154
- I was thinking about her the other day.
- Yeah... she's good.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.198
- And how's your sister?
- Yeah, good.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.242
- You staying clean?
- Uh-huh.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.286
- Yeah? Bein' a good girl?
- Mm-hm.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.163
How long have you
been clean for?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.914
Um, since the summertime.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.002
Now, are you in AA,
or are you in NA?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.587
Rue: Um...

19:31.587 --> 19:32.588
- NA.
- Suze: NA.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.089
- Rue: Mm-hm.
- Suze: Okay, good to hear.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.257
That's just terrific.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.050
- I--
- Suze: I'm not a big fan of AA.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.386
Honey, do you remember
when your father...

19:39.386 --> 19:41.680
sent me
to AA that one time?

19:41.680 --> 19:42.848
I was just kickin'
and screamin'.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.266
Just a bunch
of hoity-toity

19:44.266 --> 19:45.893
assholes giving
their advice

19:45.893 --> 19:47.144
whether you ask
for it or not--

19:47.144 --> 19:49.271
Suze, can I use
your bathroom, please?

19:49.271 --> 19:51.231
- ...nightmare. Absolutely.
- Thank you so much.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.608
Knock yourself out, sweetheart.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.903
It's nice to see you.
You look great.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.322
She's not doin' good.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.857
Fuck.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.237
Oh...

20:58.423 --> 21:02.511
Ah, fuck.
It'll never fuckin' end.

21:02.511 --> 21:06.014
This can't make
you feel good, Rue.
Livin' like this.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.599
Lyin' to the people you love,

21:07.683 --> 21:09.518
bein' mean
to the people you love.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.437
- This can't make you feel good about yourself.
- Rue: I don't care.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.981
Just fuckin' leave
me alone, please.

21:13.981 --> 21:18.068
- I know you're in pain.
- Rue: You have no fucking idea, Mom.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.736
Leslie:
Let's get back
into the car,

21:19.820 --> 21:21.321
and let me take you
to the hospital.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.574
I can't get clean.
I can't do that shit forever.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.161
You don't have to.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.622
Just... take it
one day at a time.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.291
Yeah.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.423
- Hey, Cass?
- Cassie: Yeah?

21:39.423 --> 21:43.427
- I have a quick question for you.
- What?

21:43.427 --> 21:46.304
How long have you been
fucking Nate Jacobs?

21:51.018 --> 21:54.062
Wh-what, what, what
are you talking about?

21:54.146 --> 21:56.565
Rue:
How long have you
been fucking Nate?

21:56.565 --> 22:00.110
Cassie:
I'm not.
What? I'm not.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.528
What are you talking about?

22:01.528 --> 22:04.031
Oh, I just--
I, I saw her get his truck,

22:04.031 --> 22:05.490
and then, kiss him
and drive off.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.242
That was, like,
what, like, uh...

22:07.242 --> 22:08.994
- Uh--
- Rue: like a month ago?

22:08.994 --> 22:10.996
Uh--

22:10.996 --> 22:13.665
- Are you kidding me?
- Uhh.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.418
Cass, that's, like...
really bad.

22:19.254 --> 22:22.340
You're fucking Nate?
Are you kidding me?

22:24.134 --> 22:27.512
No, I...
I don't even know why
she would say that.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.348
- You're lying!
- Yeah, can we just table this conversation?

22:30.432 --> 22:32.768
- Okay, let's go--
- No, no. You expect me to stand here

22:32.768 --> 22:34.436
next to my best friend
who's been lying to me

22:34.436 --> 22:36.354
about fucking
my ex-boyfriend!

22:36.438 --> 22:38.565
- I'm literally gonna get violent.
- Okay, no. Let's just--

22:38.565 --> 22:40.609
Suze:
No, there is no need
to get violent, okay,

22:40.609 --> 22:42.402
because we are having
an intervention!

22:42.486 --> 22:44.404
- Stop it!
- I'm beggin' you.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.032
- Let's just get into the car.
- Mom... I can't.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.493
- Kat: Let's just talk--
- Maddy: Oh, you're crying?!

22:49.493 --> 22:52.245
- No-- Maddy!
- You're fucking crying, you fucking bitch?!

22:52.329 --> 22:54.164
- Maddy, come on!
- You're the one who's hurt?

22:54.164 --> 22:55.540
You're the most
self-centered,

22:55.624 --> 22:57.667
- idiotic person I have ever fucking met!
- Maddy.

22:57.751 --> 23:01.463
- You fuck my ex, and you're fucking crying?!
- Maddy, Maddy.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.131
Are you fucking
kidding me?!

23:03.215 --> 23:04.758
- Let's just do this later.
- Leslie: Look, I'm sorry.

23:04.758 --> 23:07.427
I'm sorry,
but I don't give a shit
who's fucking who, okay?

23:07.511 --> 23:09.429
If you're gonna
keep talkin' about it,
get out of the room.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.890
- Yeah, absolutely. You're being an animal...
- Um, Cass?

23:11.890 --> 23:13.183
- Do you wanna go on a walk?
- right now... to my girl.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.601
I don't even know why
you're believing her.

23:14.601 --> 23:15.977
She's a drug addict.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.854
Maddy:
How long have you
been fucking him?

23:17.938 --> 23:19.731
- Be honest.
- Maddy, let's just do it later.

23:19.815 --> 23:23.318
Kat, shut the fuck up!
How long have you
been fucking him?!

23:24.277 --> 23:25.946
Rue?

23:25.946 --> 23:28.698
Listen, let's just get
into the car, okay?

23:28.782 --> 23:30.325
When was this?

23:32.786 --> 23:34.746
Right after New Year's.

23:34.830 --> 23:35.872
Oh!

23:35.956 --> 23:39.334
You dumb fucking bitch!
I'm gonna fuck you--

23:39.334 --> 23:41.336
Don't fuckin' run away from me,
you stupid fucking bitch!

23:41.336 --> 23:42.838
Why are you guys...
Come on!

23:45.799 --> 23:48.760
- I don't--
- Suze: Goddammit, I'm so sorry.

23:48.844 --> 23:49.886
Rue?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.545
- Fezco: What's up, kid?
- Hey.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.923
- You look like shit.
- Yeah, I fuckin' feel like shit.

24:27.007 --> 24:30.218
I think I'm going
through withdrawal
and I, I need somethin'.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.054
- Can't help you. I don't have nothin' here.
- Rue: Ah fuck, man.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.348
You gotta have something.
That's bullshit.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.267
Don't know what to tell you.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.227
I don't keep nothin'
at the house no more.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.354
- Fuck, okay.
- Not no more.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.315
Well, can I, can I
use your bathroom?

24:43.315 --> 24:47.819
- Fezco: Go ahead!
- Okay... Ah fuck.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.696
Where did you come from?

24:54.910 --> 24:56.786
- Yo, you all right in there?
- Rue: Don't-- I'm fuckin'--

24:56.870 --> 24:59.039
I'm shittin' my brains out.
Please, Fez, go away.

24:59.039 --> 25:03.251
- You want some Pepto Bismol or something?
- Rue: No! No, fuck.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.254
- Just go away.
- All right, all right.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.641
Yo, come on now, Rue.

26:01.184 --> 26:04.312
- Are you serious?
- Fez, please.

26:04.396 --> 26:07.816
- No, no, no.
- Please? Please, let me. Let me take them. Just--

26:07.816 --> 26:10.610
Only three.
She won't even know
that they're gone.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.488
- She won't miss them.
- It's the principle, Rue.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.115
- It's just not right.
- Please, just let-- Just let me

26:15.115 --> 26:16.825
- keep 'em. Please?
- It's not right.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.952
- I'm in a lot of pain, Fez, please.
- Give it to me, Rue.

26:18.952 --> 26:22.205
- Give it to me. Let go.
- Please?

26:22.289 --> 26:25.041
- Please... Fuck.
- You gotta leave the house.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.918
- Let go of me. Fez, let go!
- You gotta leave the house, Rue.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.504
Get off of me!
Get your fuckin'
hands off of me!

26:29.504 --> 26:31.840
- Get the fuck off me, you piece of shit!
- Hell, nah!

26:31.840 --> 26:33.133
- Don't fuckin'--
- Nah, come here!

26:33.133 --> 26:35.010

You don't have

You don't have--

26:46.438 --> 26:47.564
You, you don't ha--

26:47.564 --> 26:49.816
You don't have

You don't have to!

26:49.816 --> 26:51.234
Don't fuckin' have to put me--

26:51.318 --> 26:52.652
- You don't have to put me out there!
- Fezco: No, no, no.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.946
- Rue: No. Fuck.

Ow.

Ah...

37:11.062 --> 37:16.025
- Hi.
- Ruby Bennett, I'm so happy to see you.

37:23.074 --> 37:28.245
I, uh...
I don't have the money
right now, but...

37:28.329 --> 37:31.290
I, uh...
I brought this.

37:31.374 --> 37:34.877
This, this is, like,
a thousand dollars
worth of jewelry,

37:34.961 --> 37:39.840
and, uh,
I have, um...

37:39.924 --> 37:44.387
$2,000 right here... um.
That's all I have right now.

37:44.387 --> 37:47.223
Rue, why didn't you
just pick up the phone
and tell me that?

37:47.223 --> 37:50.184
You could've just said,
"Laurie, I don't have
a dozen eggs,

37:50.268 --> 37:52.019
I've only got eight."

37:52.103 --> 37:54.689
- I was just worried.
- About what?

37:54.689 --> 37:56.691
That you would be angry.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.901
You wanna know
a funny thing about me?

37:58.985 --> 38:02.905
I don't think I've
ever gotten angry
in my entire life.

38:03.864 --> 38:05.324
Really?

38:05.408 --> 38:07.410
Laurie:
Well, I don't know
if that's true.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.245
Is that true?

38:11.163 --> 38:14.208
Yeah, no, that's true.
I've never gotten angry.

38:17.169 --> 38:20.172
You did lie to me, though.
You said you were sober.

38:20.256 --> 38:24.343
- I was.
- Rue, you're lying to me again.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.886
I know it might be
hard to believe,

38:25.970 --> 38:28.180
but I was
a college athlete.

38:28.264 --> 38:32.059
I was pretty tough,
and then I got injured.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.103
And over the years,
I had surgeries,

38:34.103 --> 38:36.272
and I had screws
put in my shoulder.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.025
And then, eventually,
I got put on oxycontin.

38:39.025 --> 38:42.069
I was a schoolteacher by that time,

38:42.153 --> 38:44.196
and I had a family.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.364
You should've seen us.

38:45.448 --> 38:48.492
We were, like, right out
of a Sears catalog.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.871
I didn't even know it was
addictive until I ran out.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.165
And that's when I learned

38:54.165 --> 38:57.335
I would do anything
to avoid withdrawal

38:57.335 --> 38:59.086
'cause it's hell.

38:59.170 --> 39:03.090
- You're going through hell, aren't you?
- Yeah.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.761
- How much have you been doing?
- Forty mil.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.138
You know, I wish
you had caught me
earlier in the week

39:09.138 --> 39:10.890
'cause I had a whole
assortment of things

39:10.890 --> 39:13.100
that would've taken
the pain away.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.896
- Now, all I've got is morphine.
- I can take morphine.

39:16.896 --> 39:22.401
I only have the intravenous,
and you don't fix, do you?

39:22.485 --> 39:26.655
- No.
- Then, unfortunately, I can't help you.

39:27.948 --> 39:29.992
Listen, I appreciate
you coming here

39:30.076 --> 39:31.994
with all this
jewelry and stuff,

39:32.078 --> 39:35.373
but you're gonna have to pay
the whole thing in cash.

39:35.373 --> 39:39.960
- This isn't a pawn shop.
- I know. I'm sorry.

39:40.044 --> 39:43.506
So, when do you think
you're gonna come up
with the rest of it?

39:43.506 --> 39:44.673
Um...

39:45.508 --> 39:48.719
Soon... Really soon.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.931
Rue, you don't look like
someone who's gonna come up

39:51.931 --> 39:53.974
with money real soon.

39:56.769 --> 40:00.606
You know, a doctor once told me
they did brain studies on people

40:00.606 --> 40:02.691
who've done a lot of opiates,

40:02.775 --> 40:04.944
and that over time,

40:04.944 --> 40:06.362
all the chemicals
in your brain

40:06.362 --> 40:08.197
that make you happy
and feel good

40:08.197 --> 40:12.409
start to decrease
because your body's
getting it artificially.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.328
But the longer you use,

40:14.328 --> 40:16.497
it just starts
to weaken and wither,

40:16.497 --> 40:20.334
kinda like a limb
that's not getting
blood to it anymore.

40:20.334 --> 40:22.711
And then, it just
sort of falls off,

40:22.795 --> 40:25.256
and you get something
called cell death,

40:25.256 --> 40:27.716
where you just have
these big dead spots

40:27.800 --> 40:30.678
in the parts of your brain
that used to make you happy.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.597
No matter what you do,
you can't ever get it back.

40:33.681 --> 40:39.186
He said it's basically
the same brain as people
who've had major strokes.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.981
But the silver lining
is that the things that

40:41.981 --> 40:45.568
don't feel good
don't feel as bad
anymore.

40:48.404 --> 40:51.323
You know, if I was
going through withdrawal,

40:51.407 --> 40:53.117
I would do anything.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.997
It's one of the good parts
of being a woman.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.290
Even if you don't have money,

40:59.290 --> 41:01.792
you've still got
something people want.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.887
I think I'm gonna be sick.

- Laurie: I know. I'm so sorry.

42:48.941 --> 42:51.110
Rue:

42:51.110 --> 42:53.612

that you have.

42:53.696 --> 42:56.615

- Rue: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

I know. It's gonna be okay.
Just give me your arm.

43:27.688 --> 43:31.567
- Now, try to make a fist.
- Okay.

Laurie:
Okay, I'm gonna need
you to be still, Rue.

43:55.466 --> 43:58.969
- Hold it steady, Rue.
- Rue: I know. I'm trying. I'm sorry.
