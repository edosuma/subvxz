know about this oedipus guy?

my situation for what it is:

00:46.672 --> 00:47.921
- Aww.
- How nice.

Leaving a trail of blood
to the palace gates,

08:23.745 --> 08:26.087
Which is more fun
with a friend.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.423
- All right!

08:28.509 --> 08:30.175
- [sighs]

08:32.262 --> 08:33.512
- I don't know
if this is helpful,

08:33.555 --> 08:35.472
But depending on
when those goats were killed,

08:35.516 --> 08:37.516
I may have been
at home masturbating.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.310
It actually depends very little
on when they were killed.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.104
- Was it in front of a crowd
of reputable witnesses?

08:43.148 --> 08:44.231
- Bless your heart, son.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.690
I'm not 100 anymore.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.275
- Dad, under my new system,

08:47.361 --> 08:49.653
You have the right
to say nothing.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.238
I'd like you to do that.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.323
- If I say nothing,
won't I look guilty?

08:53.367 --> 08:55.659
- Not as much
as if you say anything.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.826
I've got a strategy.

08:56.912 --> 08:57.911
I'm going to convince everyone

08:57.996 --> 08:59.037
You were accused

08:59.122 --> 09:01.581
Simply because
you are a monster.

09:01.667 --> 09:02.666
[echoing boom]

09:02.793 --> 09:03.875
- Sorry I'm late.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.710
I walked instead of flying.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.004
Last thing this city needs
is more panic.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.464
- Excuse me!

09:09.550 --> 09:12.175
We can't just have
a sphinx wandering around.

09:12.219 --> 09:15.387
- The sphinx's name is brenda,
and I'm here

09:15.472 --> 09:17.931
To represent the goat farmers
against your father.

09:18.016 --> 09:21.309
- Now you can't make us
look anti-monster.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.436
- Brenda, why?
This isn't who you are.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.897
You love riddles.
- I loved one.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.400
It got solved,
and we all have to eat,

09:28.485 --> 09:31.111
Appropriately,
in normal quantities,

09:31.154 --> 09:32.779
With human permission.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.115
[humans cheering]

09:35.200 --> 09:37.200
- Everyone,
stop being loud and young!

09:37.286 --> 09:39.035
- Did you have
a backup strategy?

09:39.121 --> 09:41.121
- I did,
but it was basically

09:41.164 --> 09:43.707
To double down
on the first one.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.128
As a trader of pottery,
you've seen a lot of stories

09:48.213 --> 09:51.172
Painted on a lot of vases,
pots, and bowls, correct?

09:51.216 --> 09:53.967
- Well, of course.
That's why I got into ceramics.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.093
I'm a news junkie.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.970
- And how many vases
have you seen

09:57.055 --> 09:59.055
Depicting monsters
as innocent creatures?

09:59.099 --> 10:01.349
- [laughs] none.
- You're laughing about that.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.977
- Well, it's funny
to imagine a vase

10:04.104 --> 10:05.937
Showing a monster
helping someone.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.647
Nobody would want it.

10:07.691 --> 10:11.484
- "nobody would want it."

10:11.528 --> 10:12.652
Your expert.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.070
- Thank you.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.656
Do you ever keep old pottery?

10:16.742 --> 10:19.367
- Well, the older a vase gets,
the less valuable.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.662
But I do keep an archive
of stories that seem important.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.582
- Oh? Anything this court
might find enlightening?

10:25.667 --> 10:28.752
- Well, as a matter of fact,
I sure did find something.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.046
This bowl is centuries old.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.298
We can't know
what region this was,

10:33.383 --> 10:36.468
But you see here a monster
that looks like the accused.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.929
And these appear
to be human babies.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.975
And then this would be
the accused eating the babies.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.101
[crowd gasps]
- oh, no.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.812
- Oh, that was mesopotamia.

10:47.856 --> 10:48.897
Or sumeria.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.106
I get them confused.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.025
One thing is for sure, though:

10:52.110 --> 10:54.569
I have gained weight.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.949
- Why didn't you tell me
you spent

10:59.993 --> 11:01.993
Part of your life
eating babies?

11:02.079 --> 11:03.286
- I'm on trial
for eating goats.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.871
It hardly seemed relevant.

11:04.956 --> 11:05.955
- Not to get us off track,

11:05.999 --> 11:07.207
But what do they taste like?

11:07.250 --> 11:08.500
- Do not answer that!

11:08.543 --> 11:11.211
- Look, I spent some time
a thousand years ago

11:11.338 --> 11:13.672
Imprisoned in a pit
by a tribe of humans

11:13.715 --> 11:16.925
That refused to feed me
anything but their enemies.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.010
- Who's enemies with babies?

11:19.096 --> 11:21.388
- You know, human values
have a habit of drifting.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.348
It always starts with
"let's get rid of bad people"

11:23.433 --> 11:26.434
And somehow always ends up
with a baby pit.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.145
Oh, honey, you're back.
I missed you.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.814
- What are you doing?
- Whoops.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.274
[crow squawks]
your loss, whoever you are.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.485
- I don't care what you do
with that slutty bird.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.029
I just need you
to do me a small favor.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.073
- Anything, my love.
- Kill your son.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.033
- Okay,
but since he's defending me,

11:42.119 --> 11:43.576
It might be a bit of an issue.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.037
- Not our son, your son.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.831
I'd do it,
but you know the rules.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.082
"you make 'em, you kill 'em."

11:49.126 --> 11:50.250
- Nobody's killing anyone.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.918
What do you think
hippocampus did

11:51.962 --> 11:53.294
That would warrant his murder?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.964
- He took my killassians away
from me.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.257
- So what?
It's not like

11:57.300 --> 11:58.925
You ever did anything
to earn their worship.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.677
- You don't earn worship.

12:00.721 --> 12:01.761
Then it's not worship.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.888
If I had to do things
to get things,

12:03.932 --> 12:05.473
I'd be one of you things.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.475
- Well, if people praised you
and never get anything for it,

12:07.561 --> 12:10.854
Doesn't it stand to reason
that they might stop?

12:10.981 --> 12:12.397
- Of course.
You're right.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.232
I don't have
to kill your brother.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.067
I just have
to bribe everyone with gifts

12:16.111 --> 12:18.403
So they forget all
about that stupid science.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.029
- That's not really
what I was saying.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.240
- Got what I wanted.
Not listening.

12:22.284 --> 12:24.117
- Okay, back
to what's actually important.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.952
Dad, I'm going
to lose this case,

12:26.037 --> 12:27.287
And you're going to die.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.997
- Look, I know laws
just got invented,

12:29.082 --> 12:30.874
But I think your dad needs
to break a couple

12:30.959 --> 12:31.916
If he's gonna live.

12:31.960 --> 12:32.917
- She's right.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.169
I'll tell people you escaped.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.796
Can you maul and trample me
a little?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.047
Oh, in a way that doesn't hurt.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.340
- I can't run now, son.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.884
Your people would kill you.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.302
- They'll kill you if you stay.

12:42.387 --> 12:46.139
- But legally, thanks to you.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.641
- You're welcome?

12:50.312 --> 12:53.062
- Someone in this city
killed the goats, folks,

12:53.106 --> 12:56.065
And someone in your city
used to eat babies.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.067
Not exactly a riddle.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.944
I'd know.
I'm a sphinx.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.154
You want to hear a riddle?

13:01.198 --> 13:02.739
- Oh, god.
Here she goes.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.407
- What has four legs
in the morning,

13:04.534 --> 13:06.785
Two legs at noon,
and three legs at night?

13:06.828 --> 13:10.872
Man because he crawls as a baby
and uses a cane when he's old.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.248
Thank you.
- Ooh.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.292
- That was a good riddle.
- Impressive.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.627
- I'm not addressing
that riddle

13:15.712 --> 13:18.046
Because it has nothing to do
with the trial.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.923
Also, not a great riddle.

13:19.966 --> 13:20.840
- We liked her riddle.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.050
- It's clearly popular,

13:22.093 --> 13:23.676
Which is why
I won't criticize it,

13:23.762 --> 13:26.930
But it's frustrating
when popular things are stupid.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.306
- Come on.
- Crazy.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.475
- The sphinx's riddle is
not on trial, young man.

13:30.519 --> 13:33.144
- No, it's not
and never has been.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.313
Maybe it should've been.
[people grumbling]

13:35.398 --> 13:36.356
Moving on.

13:36.358 --> 13:37.565
- Excuse me.
Not moving on.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.984
I want to know
what makes my riddle stupid.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.110
- I shouldn't have said that.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.155
That was rude,
and I'm sorry.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.241
I just think
that a proper riddle

13:46.326 --> 13:48.409
Is a solvable
linguistic puzzle,

13:48.537 --> 13:50.954
Like, what can be touched
but not seen?

13:50.956 --> 13:52.789
The heart.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.583
- Can we just find
his father guilty now?

13:55.627 --> 13:57.919
- You don't wanna hear
his closing argument?

13:57.963 --> 13:59.254
- Kind of a waste of time.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.297
- Yeah, this guy's time
is so important.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.341
What are you, late to marry
an overrated riddle?

14:03.426 --> 14:05.301
[people booing]

14:06.471 --> 14:10.390
- Killassians,
deliria has returned.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.643
And I think you're going
to like what I brought with me.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.144
- An air of desperation?

14:15.230 --> 14:17.772
- In my thousands of years
on this planet,

14:17.858 --> 14:19.274
I have learned many things,

14:19.359 --> 14:23.570
But mostly how to properly
reward my worshippers.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.780
So you're welcome.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.074
Ooh, honey.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.076
Yum, yum, yum.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.370
- Bribery?
Isn't that beneath you?

14:32.414 --> 14:34.372
- Not if it works.
- It won't.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.832
You can offer them
anything you want,

14:35.917 --> 14:37.876
But they won't take it.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.294
Asskill, wanna tell her why?

14:39.421 --> 14:41.921
- Science has opened our eyes
to amazing new concepts.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.673
I mean, the baths alone.

14:43.675 --> 14:44.674
Right, bath buddy?

14:44.676 --> 14:45.884
- Not in front of people.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.678
- You idiots really believe
this nonsense?

14:48.722 --> 14:51.347
I'm a god. I'm real.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.182
- It's called faith,
stepmother,

14:53.268 --> 14:55.351
And it's much bigger than you.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.730
- But is it bigger
than sandals?

14:58.857 --> 15:01.524
Shovels? Dairy cows?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.318
Piles of hair?

15:03.361 --> 15:05.945
Killassians: All hail science!

15:05.989 --> 15:07.655
- Shall we talk?

15:07.699 --> 15:09.324
- What do you want?

15:09.367 --> 15:12.035
- I want you
to let me call you mom.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.328
- What? Why?

15:13.371 --> 15:14.996
- Does it matter?
- No.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.789
Because it's never going
to happen.

15:16.833 --> 15:17.957
- Which is exactly why

15:18.001 --> 15:20.251
It's the only thing
I will accept.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.337
- You do realize
it won't mean anything.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.255
You can't make me love you.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.090
- Pfft, I don't want your love.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.216
I want power.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.510
You see,
every time I call you mom,

15:29.596 --> 15:31.638
You'll know I beat you.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.806
That's worth everything.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.725
- I am strangely impressed

15:35.810 --> 15:38.269
By your cold,
unfeeling calculations.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.854
- I thought you might be.
- Fine.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.273
Because you are power-hungry
and have proven yourself

15:42.359 --> 15:45.109
A worthy adversary,
I will allow you this.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.278
- I know you will, mom.

15:47.322 --> 15:50.239
- Ooh, it's like being stabbed
in the ears.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.409
Now can we finally get out
of this dusty hellhole?

15:53.495 --> 15:56.412
- Absolutely.
I miss my bed and my lab.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.373
Plus, no matter
how much water they get,

15:58.458 --> 16:02.126
These people still smell
like half-dead muskrats.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.921
All hail science or whatever.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.714
Smell ya later!

16:06.758 --> 16:09.050
What are you gonna do about
all your lost worshippers?

16:09.094 --> 16:10.259
- Well, I'm not too worried.

16:10.345 --> 16:12.303
I have a feeling
they'll find their way back.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.888
I might not know
what humans like,

16:13.974 --> 16:15.807
But I know what they don't:

16:15.934 --> 16:17.642
Locusts!

16:17.727 --> 16:19.102
[buzzing]

16:19.145 --> 16:22.605
[people screaming]

16:22.649 --> 16:24.649
- And if a lifetime,
which is a series of days,

16:24.734 --> 16:26.150
Looks like a single day,

16:26.277 --> 16:29.946
Your perspective is so distant
that a cane would be a leg,

16:30.031 --> 16:32.115
So it's not just
a jumble of metaphors.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.616
It's the best riddle ever,

16:33.660 --> 16:36.077
And I now understand
why people like it.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.203
Good enough?

16:38.456 --> 16:40.873
- All right, you may begin
your closing argument,

16:40.959 --> 16:42.917
But it better be good.

16:42.961 --> 16:46.087
- Fact: Your goats were eaten.

16:46.131 --> 16:49.549
Fact: My dad...

16:49.634 --> 16:51.342
- Ate babies.

16:51.428 --> 16:54.679
- Stop telling everyone
you ate babies!

16:54.764 --> 16:56.723
Stop talking.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.559
Everything you say is...

17:01.563 --> 17:03.396
True.

17:03.523 --> 17:08.026
My father has never lied
in his life.

17:08.987 --> 17:09.944
I should know.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.405
I grew up wishing he would.

17:12.490 --> 17:17.326
I also grew up
constantly lying about him.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.872
I told people
I didn't have a father.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.166
I was ashamed of him

17:23.251 --> 17:24.917
Because he's shameless.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.127
- It's true.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.421
- We want to be good.

17:28.465 --> 17:31.841
We want
to set wrong things right.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.718
You know who else wanted that?

17:33.803 --> 17:35.386
These guys.

17:35.472 --> 17:38.056
Chucking babies
into a monster's mouth.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.099
What happened here?

17:40.143 --> 17:42.685
If we asked these humans,
would they tell us,

17:42.729 --> 17:45.188
Or would they say,
"it didn't happen that way.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.981
"there's more to it than that.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.191
"the babies were bigger.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.193
"they were
very dangerous babies.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.986
You had to be there.
Trust me"?

17:52.072 --> 17:54.781
Well, I don't trust them.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.699
They're too human.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.451
They mean too well.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.453
And they want too much.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.998
And they lie too often.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.793
Is there a reason
not to let this guy babysit?

18:06.878 --> 18:08.377
Yep.

18:08.463 --> 18:12.006
Are there reasons not to take
his grooming advice? Yes.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.674
When you look at him,
listen to him,

18:13.718 --> 18:15.093
Or watch him do anything,

18:15.136 --> 18:17.678
Is it reasonable
to be disgusted?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.472
Maybe.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.508
But there's no reason
to mistrust him.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.978
He's never pretended
to be better than he is.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.773
That's me.
That's you.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.525
That's these guys.

18:30.610 --> 18:35.655
That's why humans have to be
extra careful about justice.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.073
We're too good at it.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.326
And too wrong, too often.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.121
This guy ate babies.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.581
He didn't eat your goats.
Thank you.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.000
- Mm-hmm.
- Very impressive.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.377
- I'll tell you
what happened here.

18:49.462 --> 18:53.172
One of these babies survived
and sired my ancestors.

18:53.258 --> 18:58.010
I am the last descendant
of the baby that got away.

18:58.096 --> 19:01.556
- Son,
this is a goat-eating trial.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.723
- No, you idiots!

19:02.809 --> 19:04.809
The whole point
of killing the goats

19:04.894 --> 19:06.102
Was to make you understand

19:06.187 --> 19:08.396
You're sheltering
an evil beast!

19:08.481 --> 19:11.732
- Wait, are you saying
you killed our goats?

19:11.818 --> 19:12.733
- Look! Goats!

19:12.819 --> 19:14.861
[scared panting]

19:14.946 --> 19:16.028
- Let's go!
- Let's get him!

19:16.114 --> 19:17.071
- Come on!
- Get him!

19:17.157 --> 19:19.115
- We find the monster innocent.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.741
Get the torches!
- Yeah!

19:20.785 --> 19:21.701
[jury cheering]

19:23.496 --> 19:26.080
- Go get him.
- [laughs evilly]

19:26.124 --> 19:28.791
- Justice is hereby over.
Keeping the hammer.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.084
- Thank you, son.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.254
- You're welcome,
you baby-eating old bastard.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.714
[crowd cheering]
- come on!

19:34.799 --> 19:36.257
Get him!
- [sobbing]

19:36.259 --> 19:37.842
- Yeah!
- [grunts]

19:37.927 --> 19:39.218
- Should they be doing that?

19:39.262 --> 19:41.137
Doesn't everybody
have rights now?

19:41.222 --> 19:43.222
- Yeah, everybody but that guy.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.308
Let's take the win.
- Congratulations.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.601
I had a feeling
you were innocent.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.061
- Are you serious?
Then what the hell, brenda?

19:49.147 --> 19:50.479
Why?
- I was hungry.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.690
And they offered me
a lot of goat carcasses.

19:52.734 --> 19:53.941
Hey, king tyrannis,

19:54.110 --> 19:55.943
What's a dick in the morning...
- Yep, that's okay.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.278
- And then at night?
- We get it.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.529
- You.
- Oh, wow.

19:58.573 --> 20:00.156
Good thing you followed
all the way through.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.825
- What can't hear a dick
over the sound of it leaving?

20:02.911 --> 20:05.453
Brenda the legal sphinx!

20:06.831 --> 20:08.706
[whoosh]
aah!

20:08.791 --> 20:10.458
Both: Whoa!
- Holy!

20:10.501 --> 20:11.542
- Did you see that?

20:11.628 --> 20:14.212
- Sphinx flying
just outside the city.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.297
- Mom got it!
- Mom, no!

20:16.341 --> 20:18.591
- Oh, he's just as much
my child as you two.

20:18.676 --> 20:19.884
- No, not that.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.178
That was, uh--
we knew her.

20:22.263 --> 20:24.180
- Well, she may be alive.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.098
- She was making sounds
going down.

20:26.184 --> 20:29.185
Not good sounds,
but not no sounds.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.187
- [sighs]
do I have to go and get her?

20:31.231 --> 20:34.440
- No, we'll all
go get her together.

20:34.525 --> 20:37.360
- So I have
to go get her slowly.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.281
Ugh.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.286
- I say, darling,
do you ever think

20:47.372 --> 20:50.248
How lucky you are that you
don't have to bathe yourself?

20:50.333 --> 20:53.542
No washing your armpits
or legpits or wingpits

20:53.628 --> 20:54.710
Or your tailpit?

20:54.796 --> 20:56.712
- Can't say that I have.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.140
Have you quite finished?

21:08.184 --> 21:11.143
- Well, now I have
to start again.

21:11.229 --> 21:12.687
- Isn't it strange

21:12.730 --> 21:14.689
How the things you once
found cute in a lover

21:14.732 --> 21:18.192
Become the very things that
end up torturing you forever?

21:18.236 --> 21:20.653
- Well, I like the idea
of being loved forever.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.738
- Then stop that.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.327
I like it too.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.205
- Did you get any of that?

21:33.751 --> 21:35.293
- Bento.
[applause]
