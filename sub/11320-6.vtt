WEBVTT

00:23.064 --> 00:24.065
Who is that girl?

00:25.233 --> 00:26.860
She doesn't seem to be her caregiver.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.613
Come over tonight.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.157
We need

00:32.449 --> 00:33.742
to come to terms on this.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.267
It's okay. Leave it.

01:03.980 --> 01:04.981
Your dad

01:05.648 --> 01:07.067
figured it out, didn't he?

01:07.609 --> 01:09.110
Figured what out?

01:09.694 --> 01:10.737
He doesn't know anything.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.614
He really doesn't know?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.367
Answer me.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.039
Why are you so afraid of him?

01:21.581 --> 01:23.541
He doesn't care if you die.

01:23.792 --> 01:24.918
Isn't this for the best?

01:25.502 --> 01:27.253
It was your wish to upset him.

01:27.712 --> 01:28.922
It's better if he knows.

01:30.924 --> 01:31.925
I'll take care

01:32.634 --> 01:33.635
of things with Dad.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.555
I'll explain everything to him
and have him understand,

01:38.681 --> 01:39.682
so don't worry about it,

01:39.933 --> 01:41.184
and get ready for the surgery.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.812
Your dad would never understand.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.774
Don't you know how cruel he is?

01:48.358 --> 01:49.818
What would he do?

01:50.568 --> 01:51.778
Kick me out?

01:52.487 --> 01:53.571
He wouldn't do that.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.032
Go to work.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.746
As in, do your job well at the company.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.706
I won't die.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.418
I decided to live,

02:09.254 --> 02:10.255
so don't worry

02:10.797 --> 02:11.881
and go.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.561
Get in. I'll drop you off on my way.

02:36.865 --> 02:37.991
Are you all right?

02:39.200 --> 02:40.577
It's something I need to face.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.628
Hello, Director.
I'm Chairman Han Seong-guk's assistant.

02:50.920 --> 02:51.921
Just a minute please.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.424
Sir.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.553
Dr. Cha, how have you been?

02:59.888 --> 03:00.889
Yes.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.807
I have a favor to ask.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.436
Do you know anyone at Seungjin Hospital?

03:08.605 --> 03:11.107
Can you get me information about a patient

03:11.232 --> 03:12.525
who's being treated there?

03:13.234 --> 03:15.820
Her name is Oh Mi-ran.

03:17.572 --> 03:18.573
And here...

03:19.824 --> 03:20.825
Hello.

03:35.506 --> 03:36.758
Hello.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.301
This way.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.900
I'm not a customer.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.652
I'm Hye-su's friend.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.278
I see. Hye-su is--

03:57.362 --> 03:58.488
Hye-su stepped out

03:59.530 --> 04:00.782
for a moment.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.617
Did she?

04:03.368 --> 04:07.247
Where did this brat go?

04:07.664 --> 04:11.501
You are Hye-su's friend?

04:11.834 --> 04:13.586
Yes, I am.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.088
-Why do you ask?
-Well,

04:15.296 --> 04:18.591
you're just so elegant and beautiful.

04:18.716 --> 04:19.550
I see.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.302
Thank you.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.763
But I always hear

04:23.888 --> 04:26.474
that I look much older than she does.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.642
-What?
-Yes.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.561
Who would say that? No way.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.480
You don't look older.

04:32.605 --> 04:33.982
You're so...

04:35.441 --> 04:38.069
sophisticated and elegant.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.238
Thank you.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.572
What's your name?

04:41.656 --> 04:42.657
Oh my, Seung-ju.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.286
It's you, isn't it?

04:46.536 --> 04:48.079
What? Ju-yeon?

04:48.246 --> 04:51.332
Yes, it's me, Ju-yeon.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.793
It's so good to see you.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.461
How many years has it been?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.800
-You grew up to be so handsome.
-Who is she?

05:03.011 --> 05:05.013
Isn't that Mr. Han's car?

05:05.263 --> 05:06.097
What?

05:12.061 --> 05:13.062
Hye-su.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.523
Thank you.

05:18.860 --> 05:19.861
What?

05:27.577 --> 05:28.536
Ju-yeon.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.664
-When did you come?
-What?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.583
Why are you getting out of that car?

05:34.083 --> 05:35.084
What?

05:37.128 --> 05:40.673
You ran into Mr. Han by chance, right?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.341
Yes.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.511
Mr. Han is so considerate of his employees

05:45.762 --> 05:47.430
these days.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.681
I see.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.976
-I'll be right back.
-Bye.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.020
Look at you.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.689
What's with the flowers on your dress?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.150
A flower here

05:59.442 --> 06:00.526
and here!

06:00.777 --> 06:03.571
I had a blind date.
This is my mom's style.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.364
I want to get married too.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.452
By the way, why were you
in the car with that guy?

06:09.869 --> 06:13.081
People would think you're
a real married couple.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.834
We went to the hospital.

06:17.418 --> 06:18.419
The hospital?

06:19.587 --> 06:20.838
We set the date for the surgery.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.424
When is it?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.468
Sometime next month.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.056
How are you so calm about it?

06:30.431 --> 06:32.183
Aren't you scared? You're not afraid?

06:32.975 --> 06:33.976
No, I'm not.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.813
Gosh, you troublemaker.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.815
You make me frustrated.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.110
How did it come to this?

06:43.069 --> 06:44.695
-That's hot.
-Are you okay?

06:44.904 --> 06:45.905
Let me see.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.241
Gosh, you brat.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.826
Worry about yourself!

06:50.618 --> 06:52.370
Why are you getting mad at me?

06:59.544 --> 07:01.045
You're spaced out again.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.089
Aunt.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.007
Aunt.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.638
His car is super nice

07:10.930 --> 07:12.932
and so are his clothes.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.269
He seemed to be from a rich family.

07:17.770 --> 07:18.771
Who?

07:20.982 --> 07:22.942
Hye-su's new boyfriend.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.863
He got out of the car with Eun-seong,

07:27.947 --> 07:30.074
and my heart just sank.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.288
I felt like it should be Seok-hwan

07:35.496 --> 07:38.124
getting out of the car, holding his child.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.750
That man...

07:40.001 --> 07:41.127
Hye-su's boyfriend.

07:41.502 --> 07:42.837
Where and how did you see him?

07:44.172 --> 07:45.673
How else?

07:46.883 --> 07:49.927
He got out of a white expensive
looking car that was this big.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.431
He was quite handsome.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.767
I hope he doesn't mistreat
my granddaughter.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.270
Seung-ju,

07:59.604 --> 08:01.772
I don't know why I'm so wicked.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.150
I just couldn't

08:04.942 --> 08:07.570
wish her a life of happiness.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.367
Come in.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.208
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-Are you coming from the hospital?

08:20.958 --> 08:22.126
No.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.211
I stopped by the office.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.422
You're busy with so many things.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.927
Who is that girl?

08:31.260 --> 08:33.304
Tell me the truth.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.141
She's my girlfriend.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.185
She is?

08:39.560 --> 08:41.854
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.690
We're not serious enough for that.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.692
The relationship isn't serious,

08:47.527 --> 08:49.654
but she goes to the hospital
to take care of your mom?

08:51.656 --> 08:52.657
Do you think

08:52.990 --> 08:54.158
I'm a fool?

08:55.326 --> 08:56.369
I'm sorry.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.287
I'll introduce you soon.

08:58.871 --> 08:59.872
Soon?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.707
Bring her tomorrow, then.

09:02.124 --> 09:03.334
Let's eat together.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.046
-Sorry?
-Why wait? Let's do it tomorrow.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.507
Let's see your taste in women.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.467
Tomorrow is--

09:11.551 --> 09:13.094
Why? Are you afraid of introducing her?

09:13.386 --> 09:14.720
Is there something else?

09:14.845 --> 09:16.222
No, that's not it, but--

09:16.389 --> 09:17.807
Then I'll go to her.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.393
Do you mind if I meet her myself?

09:52.174 --> 09:53.175
Hello.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.184
Is something wrong?

10:06.731 --> 10:08.566
Did he figure it out?

10:08.899 --> 10:09.900
Tomorrow,

10:10.568 --> 10:12.445
I need you to meet my dad.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.697
Your dad?

10:14.905 --> 10:16.198
You still remember my profile

10:16.949 --> 10:18.242
that you memorized last time, right?

10:18.534 --> 10:19.452
What?

10:56.155 --> 10:57.156
This one.

11:06.957 --> 11:07.958
Excuse me.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.127
Size 37.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.047
Excuse me. What is 37?

11:13.839 --> 11:14.882
It's 240.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.175
I see.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.139
This one?

11:28.604 --> 11:31.399
Gosh, you look so pretty.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.667
Do you think everything will be okay?

11:50.626 --> 11:52.128
Just last until the surgery.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.672
After the surgery is over,
I'll tell him when the time is right.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.758
My dad won't be easy.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.552
If you get stuck, just leave it to me.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.095
Okay.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.058
Seatbelt.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.264
Dad.

12:45.681 --> 12:46.807
Sorry we're late.

12:46.891 --> 12:47.933
You're here.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.189
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.576
You're a chef?

13:05.868 --> 13:06.994
Yes.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.913
This is one of my regular spots.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.499
I don't know if you like the food.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.376
It's good.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.756
Chefs are all the rage lately.

13:21.258 --> 13:25.763
So do you run your own restaurant?

13:25.846 --> 13:27.056
She's going to open one soon.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.558
We get each other well because of that.

13:29.850 --> 13:30.976
She gives me good advice.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.645
I see.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.231
How did you meet?

13:35.397 --> 13:36.774
We met in New York through a friend.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.818
I didn't ask you.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.487
Why do you keep answering?

13:45.574 --> 13:48.077
What do your parents do?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.416
My dad was a physicist,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.628
but both of my parents passed away
in an accident when I was young.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.172
My grandmother raised me.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.967
She had a big restaurant,
so I was able to study abroad

14:03.050 --> 14:04.552
and led a comfortable life.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.596
Your grandmother had a restaurant?

14:08.138 --> 14:09.348
That's good to hear.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.058
Where?

14:11.475 --> 14:13.561
Where is it?
What kind of restaurant is it?

14:13.978 --> 14:15.854
My grandmother is in Japan.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.107
Is she from there?

14:18.566 --> 14:20.693
Yes. A woman named Kumiko--

14:20.818 --> 14:22.862
Oh, do you mean Kumiko Shibata?

14:24.154 --> 14:25.281
Yes.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.784
She inherited a famous bakery company.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.537
She adopted my grandmother.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.581
She used her inheritance

14:33.706 --> 14:37.126
to start a real estate company
and a restaurant chain.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.545
She closed the restaurants

14:39.670 --> 14:42.089
and is now focusing on investing
and her charity work.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.009
Now,

14:46.260 --> 14:48.387
what did you like about Ji-hun?

14:49.430 --> 14:52.391
He is infamous for being cold.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.060
What did you fall for?

14:56.645 --> 14:58.063
No, Ji-hun is not...

15:00.900 --> 15:02.151
cold.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.529
Ji-hun may act cold,

15:06.113 --> 15:08.240
but he's warm and kind on the inside.

15:09.825 --> 15:10.868
Punk.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.411
You're a lucky guy.

15:14.663 --> 15:15.664
Dad.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.460
-What?
-Her grandmother is coming back today.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.754
She has to pick her up at the airport.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.297
She is?

15:23.380 --> 15:26.216
I couldn't tell you earlier
because you suddenly wanted to see her.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.677
Okay, then you should go.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.180
I'm sorry for causing any inconvenience.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.723
Not at all.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.769
Take good care of him.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.146
I hope to see you often.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.649
Thank you.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.859
Okay. Let's eat.

15:49.114 --> 15:49.990
Eat.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.121
-I will see you later.
-Okay.

15:59.833 --> 16:00.960
Dad.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.720
Did you have lunch here?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.097
Yes, I did.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.599
Let's go.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.729
Who is she?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.356
My girlfriend.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.402
Girlfriend?

16:27.152 --> 16:29.571
I'm sorry, but we're in a rush.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.656
I'll introduce you later.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.282
-Let's go.
-Hey,

16:32.616 --> 16:34.493
is she really your girlfriend?

16:51.760 --> 16:53.554
I think my body is feeling relaxed now.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.974
Do you want to get tteokbokki?

16:57.057 --> 16:57.933
Yes.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.644
-What?
-Your favorite food.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.064
Nuts and tteokbokki with sesame seeds.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.692
I studied a lot too.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.111
It's tteokbokki
with nuts and sesame seeds.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.155
Get it right at least.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.531
It's the same thing.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.123
Here is your tteokbokki
with nuts and sesame seeds.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.207
Thank you.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.667
It looks so good.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.431
Did you go to Japan often?

17:38.474 --> 17:39.475
No.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.893
I've never been abroad.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.728
Then who's Kumiko?

17:43.479 --> 17:44.480
Oh, that?

17:44.980 --> 17:45.981
Kumiko?

17:47.149 --> 17:48.859
Before I got married,

17:49.485 --> 17:52.613
I wanted to study in Japan,
so I studied up on it.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.449
I wanted to study baking.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.243
Of course, I had to give up,
since I had no money.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.580
She was the author
of the book I read back then.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.249
Kumiko Shibata.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.751
No.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.086
Was it Abata?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.507
I speak a little Japanese too.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.133
Hello.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.927
Please wait a second.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.512
I love you.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.806
How are you?

18:25.354 --> 18:26.355
Gross.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.484
Thanks for today.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.693
No need to thank me.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.071
I just went with the profile
you gave me last time.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.492
Coming from a rich family isn't
all good, I guess.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.494
To be honest,

18:41.286 --> 18:43.163
you were kind of a jerk.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.874
But seeing you today,

18:45.958 --> 18:47.167
I felt bad for you.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.295
You can't marry who you want

18:50.629 --> 18:52.297
or do what you want.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.633
What do you know about me?

18:55.217 --> 18:56.176
Oh my.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.720
What do I not know about you?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.556
I studied like crazy.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.976
Your interests, talents, habits,
favorite books, and taste in music.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.353
Those things seem

19:06.895 --> 19:08.564
far removed from business.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.528
The tteokbokki is getting cold.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.449
This place is really good.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.244
Very delicious.

19:26.623 --> 19:27.624
Gosh.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.336
You're so gross.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.215
You should go

19:36.341 --> 19:37.467
study abroad later.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.303
It's not that easy.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.598
After the surgery,

19:43.682 --> 19:45.601
I'll open a small snack shop like this

19:45.726 --> 19:48.270
and live a fun life with Eun-seong.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.439
That's my dream.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.065
A small snack shop.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.205
RÉSUMÉ, KANG HYE-SU

20:08.415 --> 20:11.001
ORGAN DONOR SELECTION STATEMENT

20:11.168 --> 20:13.045
REASON FOR DONATION:
FOR MOTHER-IN-LAW'S RECOVERY

20:13.337 --> 20:14.588
That punk.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.257
Dad.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.431
Don't you know how to knock?

20:24.556 --> 20:25.849
Ji-hun has a girlfriend?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.643
Tell me what's going on.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.897
Is she really his girlfriend?
Is that true?

20:32.439 --> 20:34.191
What do you mean?

20:34.316 --> 20:36.068
You don't have time to worry
about your brother.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.778
You should go and persuade Na-yoon.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.364
I brought her to you,

20:40.489 --> 20:42.199
yet you can't even win her over.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.326
What did you do to make her run away?

20:44.451 --> 20:46.078
It wasn't my fault.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.788
-That jerk--
-Jeong-hun.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.081
What?

20:50.624 --> 20:51.583
Never mind.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.293
Why can't you be like your brother?

20:53.627 --> 20:56.546
He brought a really nice girl on his own.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.931
What did he just say?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.475
Ji-hun's girlfriend?

21:09.893 --> 21:10.894
Damn it.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.358
-See you tomorrow.
-Let's grab dinner.

21:16.650 --> 21:17.651
I'm hungry.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.827
My child ripped the picture by mistake.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.290
This is my girlfriend, Kang Hye-su.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.500
We're engaged.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.638
Let's talk.

21:55.731 --> 21:56.773
Please leave.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.483
I have nothing to say.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.740
Do your parents know you're doing this?

22:05.324 --> 22:08.827
We got engaged because your dad begged us.

22:08.910 --> 22:12.122
Do you know how big a loss it will be
for both our families?

22:12.205 --> 22:14.166
What will you do about that money?

22:15.542 --> 22:17.669
I didn't know you were this reckless.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.546
Please leave.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.340
I have nothing to say.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.677
Do you know Ji-hun has a girlfriend?

22:26.803 --> 22:28.221
She even met our dad.

22:29.681 --> 22:30.682
What?

22:30.766 --> 22:31.767
Do you think I'm lying?

22:32.059 --> 22:33.143
I'm telling the truth.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.896
Dad completely loves her.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.441
Now, are you still hung up on him?

22:42.152 --> 22:43.195
Get over it.

22:43.820 --> 22:44.821
Okay?

22:44.905 --> 22:46.364
I'll be magnanimous

22:46.740 --> 22:47.866
and forgive you.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.327
You mean the woman
who works at the restaurant, right?

22:52.329 --> 22:53.497
At the restaurant?

22:53.747 --> 22:54.873
Yes.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.958
I met that girlfriend too.

22:57.417 --> 22:58.418
What?

22:58.668 --> 22:59.795
Jeong-hun,

23:00.295 --> 23:03.090
Ji-hun has nothing to do with us.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.176
Thus, nothing changes between you and me.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.930
This helped me confirm my feelings
for you,

23:10.222 --> 23:12.557
and I'm so glad I found that out now.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.978
It would've been horrendous
if I found out after the wedding.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.231
Our relationship is over.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.441
I'm sorry for the parents,

23:21.691 --> 23:23.443
but it'll be difficult to start over.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.030
-Please leave.
-Hey!

23:40.627 --> 23:42.629
I know what you're thinking!

23:42.754 --> 23:45.215
It's because you're not over Ji-hun!

23:45.423 --> 23:46.883
Do you know what he's like?

23:48.510 --> 23:49.845
He's a fraud.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.514
You're being fooled!

23:56.518 --> 23:57.519
Isn't it awesome?

23:58.353 --> 23:59.437
It's...

24:04.651 --> 24:08.155
Teacher, Jeong-min took my headband.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.699
Jeong-min, give back her headband.

24:15.787 --> 24:16.788
Give it back.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.459
Who are you?

24:22.669 --> 24:23.587
Me?

24:28.466 --> 24:29.718
He's my dad.

24:31.761 --> 24:32.637
Whatever.

24:38.059 --> 24:39.060
What about me?

24:47.485 --> 24:48.820
Hello.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.615
-Have a nice day.
-Bye.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.241
-Bye.
-Hi.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.993
-Hello. Where's Eun-seong?
-Hello.

24:55.452 --> 24:58.246
A gentleman took her earlier.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.664
A gentleman?

24:59.789 --> 25:02.459
Eun-seong said he is going to be her dad.

25:03.668 --> 25:04.961
I see.

25:05.378 --> 25:06.838
Thank you.

25:18.642 --> 25:19.935
I can do it.

25:21.519 --> 25:22.812
Go slowly.

25:23.521 --> 25:24.522
You'll fall.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.537
Watch me ride this.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.722
Mom.

25:57.931 --> 25:58.932
Hi.

26:01.935 --> 26:02.936
Come here.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.146
Are you okay?

26:05.230 --> 26:06.231
-Gosh.
-Hey.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.025
That was close.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.403
Eun-seong,

26:11.736 --> 26:12.904
where is this from?

26:12.988 --> 26:14.614
He bought it for me.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.242
-He did?
-Eun-seong,

26:17.534 --> 26:18.994
-do you want to go again?
-Yes.

26:19.703 --> 26:20.704
Let's race.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.080
Let's see who's faster.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.373
One, two, three.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.166
Be careful.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.381
Superman. Let's go.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.633
Eun-seong, he's tired. Stop.

26:33.758 --> 26:34.759
Stop.

26:35.302 --> 26:36.303
Oh my gosh.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.016
-Gosh.
-I'm going to go. Bye.

26:41.766 --> 26:42.767
Goodbye.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.102
Let's go.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.688
-Mister.
-Yes?

26:46.771 --> 26:48.148
Come home with us.

26:48.606 --> 26:51.109
Eun-seong, he's busy. Stop.

26:51.735 --> 26:52.986
Please come.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.738
But Eun-seong...

26:55.488 --> 26:56.614
Eun-seong.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.450
Eun-seong.

26:58.658 --> 26:59.534
Hurry.

27:01.745 --> 27:02.746
Come in.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.039
Hold on.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.001
Eun-seong, what are you looking for?

27:13.089 --> 27:14.090
Here it is.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.594
Ta-da. My treasure number one.

27:17.802 --> 27:18.803
They're my front teeth.

27:22.682 --> 27:23.683
Come on.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.185
Those aren't treasures.

27:26.770 --> 27:27.896
I'm hungry, Mom.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.440
-You're hungry?
-Let's have dinner.

27:30.648 --> 27:31.649
Okay.

27:31.900 --> 27:32.901
-Mister.
-Yes?

27:33.193 --> 27:34.319
Aren't you hungry?

27:34.986 --> 27:36.488
-Eun-seong.
-Yes, I'm hungry too.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.114
He needs to go.

27:39.866 --> 27:41.493
Can you cook too?

27:42.410 --> 27:43.411
Of course.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.080
What can you make?

27:47.207 --> 27:48.208
Ramyeon.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.170
I love ramyeon.

27:58.718 --> 27:59.719
Mister,

28:00.095 --> 28:01.805
make me some ramyeon. Please?

28:01.930 --> 28:02.847
Eun-seong.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.101
Sure. I'll show you what I can do.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.644
Yes!

28:08.103 --> 28:09.646
Ramyeon.

28:10.855 --> 28:11.940
Let's see.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.733
-Excuse me.
-Sit down.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.735
Where is the ramyeon?

28:22.492 --> 28:23.952
-Put it down. Hurry.
-Okay.

28:28.957 --> 28:29.833
Ta-da.

28:32.710 --> 28:33.711
Let me give you some.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.258
-Eat slowly.
-Okay.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.934
How is it? Isn't it good?

28:48.268 --> 28:49.686
I think it's undercooked.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.398
Ramyeon tastes better undercooked.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.400
You try some too, Mom.

28:55.692 --> 28:56.693
Shall I?

29:06.119 --> 29:07.620
You know how to make things like this?

29:09.289 --> 29:11.374
Who in Korea can't make ramyeon?

29:16.379 --> 29:17.797
Wait.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.466
Where is that breeze coming from?

29:20.133 --> 29:21.134
Do you want more?

29:21.676 --> 29:22.594
No, thank you.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.180
It fell.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.515
-I'll do it.
-Really?

29:27.724 --> 29:30.226
There's a breeze coming
through the window frame.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.189
My gosh.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.524
This needs to be fixed.

29:40.695 --> 29:41.571
What's this?

29:45.950 --> 29:47.035
You have a guitar.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.205
I can play a little--

29:50.330 --> 29:51.372
It's my dad's.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.291
It is?

29:53.374 --> 29:54.417
Mr. Han.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.086
It's late. You should go.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.172
I need to clean and have a lot to do.

30:00.548 --> 30:01.549
You're right.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.136
-Eun-seong.
-Yes?

30:05.303 --> 30:06.304
I'm leaving.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.181
You can go after we finish eating.

30:09.432 --> 30:11.851
Let's eat and do origami.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.646
Eun-seong, he needs to go.

30:15.563 --> 30:18.525
Let's get up and say, "Good night."

30:18.858 --> 30:20.026
Ready?

30:20.193 --> 30:21.945
-Good night.
-Good night.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.488
-Bye.
-All right.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.740
Sit down and eat.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.259
Are you okay? Oh my.

30:45.593 --> 30:46.553
Gosh.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.597
Is the motion sensor broken too?

30:49.931 --> 30:51.057
I guess so.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.854
What if you get hurt in the dark?
You have a kid too.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.523
This was always broken.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.234
We need to install

31:01.526 --> 31:02.652
a new motion sensor light.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.404
Sure.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.281
-That hurts.
-You should go.

31:06.823 --> 31:07.824
Here.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.118
Good night.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.088
Let's eat the ramyeon.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.715
Let's eat it all by ourselves.

31:25.466 --> 31:26.926
-It's good, isn't it?
-Yes.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.070
Did you catch a cold?

32:28.071 --> 32:29.113
I think so.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.450
Maybe you should rest.
You don't look well.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.953
No, I'm fine.
It's because of the change of seasons.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.372
It's because you're always going out.

32:37.872 --> 32:38.998
What was that?

32:39.082 --> 32:42.001
She's always so busy and going out.

32:42.377 --> 32:43.378
Just rest.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.171
Rest for a few days.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.507
I'm sure Mr. Han will let you
get away with it.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.133
Watch what you say.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.927
Why would Mr. Han do that?

32:51.135 --> 32:52.303
You don't know, do you?

32:52.387 --> 32:54.013
He's so good to her.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.348
He drives her around,

32:55.431 --> 32:57.767
and I saw them whispering many times.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.021
A-ra, go seat the customers.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.231
What are you doing there?

33:03.606 --> 33:05.525
It's not just Mr. Han.

33:05.608 --> 33:06.818
Mr. Park goes easy on her too.

33:07.402 --> 33:09.070
She must have crazy connections.

33:09.362 --> 33:10.613
Why you...

33:13.324 --> 33:14.325
Hye-su,

33:14.575 --> 33:16.577
someone spilled a ton of sauce out front.

33:16.661 --> 33:19.038
Go clean it up. That's the kitchen's duty.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.373
Why is that the kitchen's duty?

33:20.456 --> 33:22.417
Come on now. Just go.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.168
Go and clean.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.379
You made the sauce in the kitchen!

33:26.462 --> 33:27.463
-Why you...
-Hey.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.756
Why you two...

33:28.840 --> 33:30.091
-Go clean.
-I'm going to...

33:31.467 --> 33:33.094
Don't give him food anymore.

33:38.850 --> 33:39.851
Sorry.

33:53.781 --> 33:54.866
Hello, Mr. Han.

33:54.991 --> 33:56.659
Hi. Is Ji-hun in?

33:57.285 --> 33:58.619
He hasn't come in yet.

33:58.745 --> 33:59.746
He hasn't?

34:02.874 --> 34:05.626
Does the cleaner outside work here?

34:06.878 --> 34:07.879
Yes.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.672
She's an assistant chef.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.215
Assistant chef?

34:11.549 --> 34:12.550
Yes.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.969
-Why?
-Nothing.

34:15.553 --> 34:16.679
She's pretty.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.891
Pretty? That old lady isn't pretty.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.017
"Old lady"?

34:21.976 --> 34:23.644
-Is she married?
-Of course.

34:23.770 --> 34:24.854
She has a kid too.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.647
They say her husband died,

34:26.898 --> 34:28.024
but who knows?

34:28.357 --> 34:31.652
Anyway, she's a horrible, rotten old lady.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.488
Hello, Mr. Han.

34:35.448 --> 34:36.657
Goodbye.

34:38.117 --> 34:39.994
-Why did he come?
-Who knows?

34:56.385 --> 35:00.515
It's one, two, three, four,

35:00.598 --> 35:01.599
five zeros...

35:06.020 --> 35:07.021
Gosh.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.607
I'd have to save up my monthly pay
for a year.

35:10.525 --> 35:11.651
How much is all of this?

35:14.445 --> 35:16.572
Stay safely in here.

35:27.333 --> 35:28.334
Eun-seong.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.046
I'm making pumpkin porridge today.
Do you want some?

35:32.213 --> 35:33.214
Yes!

35:33.297 --> 35:35.591
You're such a good girl.
You eat everything well.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.218
Eun-seong.

35:37.593 --> 35:40.429
Even if I'm not around, you'll eat
everything without complaining, right?

35:41.055 --> 35:42.557
Are you going somewhere?

35:42.932 --> 35:43.933
What?

35:44.517 --> 35:45.518
Well...

35:46.477 --> 35:49.063
I may be at the hospital for a while.

35:49.772 --> 35:52.358
-So stay with Auntie Ju-yeon and--
-Why?

35:52.775 --> 35:54.485
Where are you sick?

35:55.194 --> 35:56.529
No, I'm not sick.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.197
I'm not sick.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.491
Let's talk about this later.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.577
I'll make it quickly. Keep coloring.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.206
If you're not sick,
why are you going to the hospital?

36:09.792 --> 36:10.626
What?

36:11.502 --> 36:12.753
The thing is...

36:15.673 --> 36:16.924
I said I'm not.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.885
Let me see what you're drawing.

36:19.510 --> 36:20.595
Let me see.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.930
Is this your scooter?

36:23.931 --> 36:24.932
Yes.

36:25.349 --> 36:26.642
Who is this?

36:28.144 --> 36:29.145
It's Mister.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.857
He said he would keep teaching me
how to ride the scooter.

36:33.107 --> 36:34.859
You said you didn't like him.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.235
Well,

36:36.819 --> 36:39.447
he isn't such a bad guy after all.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.909
He says so many funny things.

36:45.411 --> 36:47.872
I'll bake you some pumpkin bread too.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.833
Should we bring some to him?

36:50.958 --> 36:52.335
He likes bread too.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.003
He does?

36:54.378 --> 36:55.338
Yes.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.264
All done.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.504
SEUNGJIN HOSPITAL

38:20.881 --> 38:24.051
-Why are you--
-I wanted pumpkin porridge,

38:24.135 --> 38:25.803
but I made too much,

38:26.637 --> 38:27.722
and I thought of you.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.975
I figured that day must've got you down,

38:31.642 --> 38:32.810
so I wanted to cheer you up.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.646
Do you think

38:36.022 --> 38:37.857
this would cheer me up?

38:38.691 --> 38:39.817
Seeing you

38:40.443 --> 38:41.736
makes me uncomfortable.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.154
I know.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.655
I'm sure you are.

38:45.114 --> 38:46.657
I won't come often.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.369
The surgery is soon anyway.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.122
Please eat.

38:55.833 --> 38:56.834
Did Ji-hun

38:57.793 --> 38:59.587
tell you anything?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.172
Pardon?

39:01.464 --> 39:02.506
His dad.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.885
Did he really not know anything
when he left that day?

39:06.510 --> 39:07.636
He didn't figure it out?

39:08.888 --> 39:11.057
No. He didn't know.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.897
I just can't believe Ji-hun.

39:18.731 --> 39:19.774
Don't worry.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.069
Please have a little bit.

39:33.704 --> 39:34.955
You make Western food.

39:35.289 --> 39:37.083
How do you make such good porridge?

39:38.542 --> 39:39.919
Is there anything you can't do?

39:40.419 --> 39:42.838
I don't know about anything else,
but I'm pretty good at cooking.

39:44.924 --> 39:47.802
I used to be pretty good too
when I was young.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.971
It made me so happy

39:51.472 --> 39:53.599
to make delicious food for him.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.314
It was all for naught.

40:02.691 --> 40:03.818
By the way,

40:04.443 --> 40:05.569
look at me.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.572
Why don't you wear any makeup?

40:10.032 --> 40:12.243
You'll never get married at that rate.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.871
How long will you live alone with a kid?

40:16.455 --> 40:17.456
Until when?

40:18.124 --> 40:19.250
Here.

40:21.168 --> 40:22.211
It's a gift.

40:22.628 --> 40:25.423
You should put these things on
to get a guy.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.716
You look more sick than me.

40:29.677 --> 40:30.678
Take it.

40:36.642 --> 40:38.853
Thank you. I'll use it well.

40:42.898 --> 40:45.234
People are greedy creatures.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.822
Now that I'm going to live,

40:50.573 --> 40:52.867
why do so many things seem so unfair?

40:54.118 --> 40:55.453
When I was dying,

40:56.454 --> 40:59.415
I was grateful just for being alive.

41:03.878 --> 41:04.879
It's so unfair.

41:08.591 --> 41:09.800
My poor life.

41:21.896 --> 41:22.897
Ms. Oh.

41:24.773 --> 41:25.774
Let's...

41:26.984 --> 41:28.277
Let's live well.

41:29.111 --> 41:30.738
Both you and I.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.032
Let's have a good surgery

41:34.325 --> 41:36.702
and live great lives.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.332
I came to say that.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.421
I thought if I saw you,

41:51.592 --> 41:53.552
I'd gain courage.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.062
Thank you.

42:29.838 --> 42:31.924
Excuse me.
Where are the motion sensor lights?

42:32.007 --> 42:33.425
Motion sensor lights for the front door.

42:33.509 --> 42:34.718
-Motion sensor lights?
-Yes.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.640
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

42:42.351 --> 42:46.272
LED CIRCULAR MOTION SENSOR LIGHTS

42:46.605 --> 42:47.815
Did you fix the window frame?

42:50.401 --> 42:53.237
How shoddy was the construction
that wind blows right through?

42:56.782 --> 42:58.117
-Whatever.
-Ji-hun.

43:02.037 --> 43:03.122
I'll call you later.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.293
It's hard to see you these days.

43:07.876 --> 43:08.877
I've been busy.

43:09.628 --> 43:10.629
With what?

43:11.171 --> 43:12.381
With work, of course.

43:13.424 --> 43:14.508
Let's grab dinner later.

43:15.384 --> 43:17.803
I'm going on a business trip
to Jeju Island.

43:18.679 --> 43:21.390
Nine Resort wants to collaborate
with our restaurant.

43:22.683 --> 43:24.893
That won't do much for your annual sales.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.980
You're obsessed
with raising your sales figures.

43:30.274 --> 43:32.901
Ever since Dad showed interest in you,

43:33.861 --> 43:35.279
you've gotten quite arrogant.

43:37.323 --> 43:38.324
Dad is very pleased

43:38.657 --> 43:39.992
with your girlfriend.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.578
She must come from an impressive family.

43:43.787 --> 43:44.788
Yes.

43:45.372 --> 43:46.999
You're only introducing her to Dad?

43:47.291 --> 43:49.376
Do Mom and I not matter at all?

43:50.753 --> 43:53.422
It's still too soon to introduce her
to the entire family.

43:54.423 --> 43:55.549
Don't beat around the bush.

43:58.385 --> 44:00.179
I know about you and Na-yoon.

44:02.473 --> 44:03.474
What?

44:03.849 --> 44:05.684
Are you shocked that I know?

44:14.610 --> 44:16.654
Are you that insecure about your woman?

44:17.279 --> 44:18.280
What?

44:19.406 --> 44:21.116
I'm leaving. See you.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.744
How dare you?

44:24.620 --> 44:26.372
Do you think
I will just remain quiet about this?

44:34.505 --> 44:35.506
Hello...

44:36.715 --> 44:38.592
Look who's here.

44:38.759 --> 44:41.387
I came to ask you something.

44:42.012 --> 44:44.014
What is it that you came all the way here?

44:44.515 --> 44:47.518
Gosh, the shop looks brighter
with you in it.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.478
It's about Hye-su's boyfriend.

44:49.978 --> 44:51.522
Is it our restaurant's director?

44:52.189 --> 44:53.899
What are you talking about?

44:54.441 --> 44:55.442
Do you want some coffee?

44:56.276 --> 44:57.736
Tell me the truth.

44:58.153 --> 44:59.363
I already figured it out.

44:59.863 --> 45:00.864
It is, right?

45:00.948 --> 45:03.075
I don't know who her boyfriend is.

45:03.659 --> 45:05.411
Oh my gosh. He's the director?

45:06.286 --> 45:07.704
Gosh, that jerk.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.499
He's always toying with women
and dumping them.

45:10.666 --> 45:11.875
Does she know that?

45:12.376 --> 45:15.921
Gosh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

45:16.088 --> 45:16.922
I mean...

45:17.798 --> 45:18.799
Hey.

45:18.882 --> 45:21.385
What does it matter whom Hye-su is seeing?

45:21.969 --> 45:23.720
Do you like her?

45:24.054 --> 45:26.765
-You should've told me.
-I'm Eun-seong's uncle.

45:26.974 --> 45:29.560
Uncle? You're not even related by blood.

45:29.768 --> 45:30.853
You must stop her.

45:30.936 --> 45:32.438
She can't date that guy.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.815
She'll get hurt if she dates him.

45:35.357 --> 45:36.400
Gosh.

45:36.733 --> 45:37.860
Hey.

45:38.444 --> 45:42.197
To be honest, shouldn't we be thankful
if he wants to date her?

45:42.322 --> 45:44.450
What does she have to offer?
She even has a kid.

45:44.533 --> 45:45.826
If you don't stop her,

45:46.076 --> 45:47.453
I'll talk to him myself.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.371
Why would you talk to him?

45:49.496 --> 45:50.706
We can't leave them alone.

45:51.498 --> 45:53.542
I can't watch her be played.

45:54.168 --> 45:56.253
Who's being played?

45:56.378 --> 45:59.548
I'm sure they got married
because they like each other.

46:00.549 --> 46:01.550
What? Married?

46:02.718 --> 46:03.719
My bad.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.347
Not married, but...

46:07.431 --> 46:09.433
more like he proposed?

46:10.225 --> 46:11.560
What? Proposed?

46:11.727 --> 46:12.978
Hey.

46:13.103 --> 46:15.606
How are you exactly the same as before?

46:15.814 --> 46:18.400
It's because you're so gullible
that you caused all that trouble.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.527
Sit. Sit down, Seung-ju.

46:20.611 --> 46:21.612
Something is strange.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.907
-I need to see that jerk.
-Wait!

46:24.990 --> 46:25.991
Where are you going?

46:26.533 --> 46:28.660
Where do you think you're going?

46:28.744 --> 46:30.120
You'll get yourself fired.

46:30.829 --> 46:31.830
Let them fire me.

46:32.247 --> 46:33.790
I have nothing to fear
as a part-time worker.

46:34.833 --> 46:36.293
No. Don't do this.

46:37.586 --> 46:39.838
You don't know anything.
Don't get involved.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.381
What if you ruin everything?

46:41.465 --> 46:44.301
Will you take responsibility
if she can't get the money?

46:44.885 --> 46:45.886
What? Money?

46:46.929 --> 46:48.430
What do you mean?

46:49.223 --> 46:50.474
What money?

46:50.807 --> 46:52.392
I'm losing my mind.

46:53.685 --> 46:54.811
When did you come?

46:56.605 --> 46:58.690
I'll be on a business trip
in Jeju Island for a few days.

46:58.774 --> 46:59.650
Business trip?

47:00.859 --> 47:03.529
Is it for the contract with that resort?

47:04.780 --> 47:06.573
-Yes.
-Good.

47:06.990 --> 47:08.617
Rest for a few days while you're there.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.036
You've been stressed out about your mom.

47:11.495 --> 47:14.498
Fine. I'll give you some time off.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.377
What's this?

47:19.253 --> 47:20.379
-Don't look.
-What...

47:21.880 --> 47:22.839
Gosh.

47:23.590 --> 47:24.591
Goodness.

47:28.303 --> 47:29.304
Hey.

47:30.347 --> 47:31.181
Well,

47:31.890 --> 47:33.517
it's about Hye-su.

47:34.184 --> 47:36.061
Things are getting tough for her.

47:37.104 --> 47:38.272
You should be careful.

47:39.481 --> 47:40.607
What did I do?

47:41.108 --> 47:42.276
The employees

47:42.609 --> 47:44.278
are whispering.

47:44.403 --> 47:46.780
They think you like her.

47:47.072 --> 47:49.491
Stop calling her out in front of them.

47:49.575 --> 47:50.867
When did I?

47:51.451 --> 47:52.828
Why are you yelling?

47:52.953 --> 47:54.037
What did I do?

47:54.121 --> 47:55.914
Who likes who? Who thinks that way?

48:01.795 --> 48:03.880
What's wrong with that punk?

48:04.923 --> 48:07.634
Seung-ju, can't you let me rest?

48:10.721 --> 48:11.722
You've lost your mind.

48:13.432 --> 48:14.474
What do you mean?

48:14.683 --> 48:16.310
Why are you doing something like that?

48:16.643 --> 48:18.020
Are you trying to die?

48:18.854 --> 48:20.731
What did you hear?

48:21.023 --> 48:23.108
I knew something was up.

48:23.525 --> 48:26.486
I wondered where you got the money
to pay back that debt.

48:28.530 --> 48:29.865
Did Ju-yeon tell you?

48:31.408 --> 48:32.409
That jerk.

48:33.076 --> 48:34.995
Does he think
he can just buy off people like that?

48:35.954 --> 48:37.289
Was that the only way?

48:37.998 --> 48:39.333
-Was it?
-Yes.

48:40.208 --> 48:41.501
That was the only way.

48:42.461 --> 48:45.505
So stay out of it,
and take care of yourself.

48:48.050 --> 48:49.176
Seung-ju.

48:50.093 --> 48:52.304
How could he buy a life with money?

48:52.429 --> 48:54.056
He approached you first, didn't he?

48:54.306 --> 48:55.307
He did not.

48:55.390 --> 48:56.391
Of course he did.

48:56.933 --> 48:59.436
He knew you needed money
and came to you first.

49:00.395 --> 49:01.855
I wouldn't be surprised if he did.

49:01.980 --> 49:03.106
I said he didn't.

49:03.231 --> 49:04.232
Have you no pride?

49:04.566 --> 49:05.859
You take rides from him

49:05.984 --> 49:07.361
and live here just because he offered?

49:07.694 --> 49:10.739
He'll show off and think he's all that
because of these stupid things!

49:13.659 --> 49:15.035
What's wrong with you?

49:16.745 --> 49:18.372
This is a contract.

49:18.872 --> 49:20.207
We came to an agreement.

49:20.540 --> 49:21.541
Contract?

49:21.917 --> 49:23.251
What if something happens?

49:23.502 --> 49:24.503
Will he take responsibility?

49:24.586 --> 49:25.587
Nothing will happen.

49:25.671 --> 49:27.297
Who can guarantee that?

49:27.631 --> 49:30.050
Do you think jerks like that
even consider us to be human?

49:32.344 --> 49:33.887
Contract? Agreement?

49:34.596 --> 49:36.306
He bought a person's life with money.

49:37.641 --> 49:39.518
How is that a contract or agreement?

49:40.686 --> 49:41.520
Seung-ju.

49:43.563 --> 49:44.731
Keep it down.

49:45.232 --> 49:46.233
Lower your voice.

49:46.983 --> 49:48.527
Nobody knows about this.

49:50.028 --> 49:51.405
If word gets out, it's over.

49:52.739 --> 49:54.157
I'm finished.

49:55.242 --> 49:56.326
I need money.

49:57.786 --> 49:58.912
I need it like crazy.

50:00.789 --> 50:02.082
Please pretend you don't know.

50:05.919 --> 50:07.045
Aren't you afraid?

50:07.671 --> 50:08.839
Aren't you scared?

50:09.464 --> 50:10.465
I am afraid.

50:12.008 --> 50:13.009
I'm scared

50:13.802 --> 50:15.429
and I know it's wrong,

50:16.304 --> 50:17.431
but I won't look back

50:18.181 --> 50:19.307
or think twice.

50:20.350 --> 50:22.602
This is all I can do right now,

50:23.937 --> 50:25.856
so I'm just enduring it.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.025
Please help me.

50:31.027 --> 50:32.237
Don't say anything about it.

50:43.540 --> 50:44.583
If that jerk

50:46.042 --> 50:47.753
hurts you, I'll kill him.

50:59.473 --> 51:00.599
What are you doing here?

51:01.349 --> 51:02.350
Seung-ju.

51:03.852 --> 51:04.853
Seung-ju.

51:17.491 --> 51:18.617
It's nothing.

51:39.638 --> 51:40.639
Hello.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.433
Here you go.

52:14.798 --> 52:15.799
Mr. Han.

52:16.633 --> 52:17.759
Mr. Han...

52:20.428 --> 52:21.429
Excuse me.

52:22.597 --> 52:24.140
Yes? What is it?

52:26.101 --> 52:27.894
Did you hear--

52:27.978 --> 52:29.104
Hear what?

52:29.437 --> 52:30.689
Were you sharing secrets?

52:31.773 --> 52:32.691
No.

52:34.025 --> 52:36.319
Seung-ju is like a brother to me.

52:36.987 --> 52:39.698
We grew up like siblings
in the same neighborhood.

52:40.574 --> 52:43.285
He's my husband's distant relative,
so they grew up like brothers.

52:43.535 --> 52:45.120
He's a good kid.

52:46.746 --> 52:47.747
Okay.

52:47.873 --> 52:48.999
I don't care.

52:49.958 --> 52:51.418
All right. I see.

52:51.710 --> 52:53.086
I need to pack for a business trip.

52:53.211 --> 52:55.255
If it isn't urgent, let's talk later.

52:57.173 --> 52:58.258
Mr. Han,

52:58.800 --> 53:00.510
I have something to tell you.

53:03.722 --> 53:04.848
It's about Eun-seong.

53:05.974 --> 53:07.267
Don't be too good to her.

53:08.852 --> 53:10.562
I don't want to hurt her.

53:11.730 --> 53:13.189
We'll move out soon.

53:14.149 --> 53:17.110
Please be less nice to her until then.

53:23.450 --> 53:26.620
Also, I'm returning
the clothes I wore that day.

53:30.081 --> 53:31.041
Keep them.

53:31.541 --> 53:32.542
No.

53:32.959 --> 53:35.003
I have no reason to keep them.

53:36.087 --> 53:39.007
I finished that task,
so I should return them.

53:42.344 --> 53:43.345
Fine.

53:43.845 --> 53:44.846
You may go.

53:46.014 --> 53:47.015
Okay.

53:48.433 --> 53:51.269
Have a safe trip.

55:00.422 --> 55:02.340
You should go see a doctor.

55:06.052 --> 55:07.053
I'm fine.

55:07.512 --> 55:08.930
-I'm better.
-You are not.

55:09.097 --> 55:10.306
You're pale.

55:10.890 --> 55:12.475
Go get a checkup.

55:13.518 --> 55:14.978
No, I don't need to.

55:16.021 --> 55:17.355
I'm really fine.

55:33.955 --> 55:34.956
Mr. Park.

55:35.498 --> 55:36.833
Did you meet with Attorney Oh?

55:37.167 --> 55:39.127
Yes, I did.

55:39.294 --> 55:42.839
He said that filing
for a marriage annulment is the only way.

55:43.131 --> 55:45.842
But it won't be easy.

55:46.426 --> 55:47.469
That punk...

55:48.762 --> 55:49.763
Fine.

55:55.310 --> 55:56.311
Dad,

55:56.811 --> 55:58.146
I need to tell you something.

55:58.646 --> 56:00.356
I'm not in the mood to talk to you.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.067
It's important.

56:03.109 --> 56:04.569
What is it?

56:04.652 --> 56:05.653
Do you know

56:06.071 --> 56:07.614
that Ji-hun is fooling you?

56:07.864 --> 56:10.116
-About what?
-She's a fake.

56:11.201 --> 56:13.119
-I know.
-What?

56:13.828 --> 56:14.954
I know she's fake.

56:15.163 --> 56:16.998
Then why aren't you doing anything?

56:17.082 --> 56:19.125
Look after yourself. Don't mind him.

56:19.959 --> 56:21.211
Just get Na-yoon back.

56:21.795 --> 56:23.546
Go beg or whine.

56:25.882 --> 56:26.883
Dad,

56:27.133 --> 56:29.177
do you know who Na-yoon's other man is?

56:31.554 --> 56:33.056
It's Ji-hun.

56:33.681 --> 56:34.557
What?

56:35.600 --> 56:37.727
What did you just say?

56:37.811 --> 56:40.105
I don't know what he's scheming right now.

56:40.188 --> 56:42.649
He must have thought
he could fool all of us.

56:44.776 --> 56:46.903
Na-yoon's other man is Ji-hun?

56:47.445 --> 56:48.571
Do you

56:49.322 --> 56:50.657
have proof?

56:50.782 --> 56:52.075
Yes, I looked into it.

56:52.617 --> 56:53.618
I'm positive.

56:53.868 --> 56:56.996
They were together for a while.

56:57.080 --> 56:59.582
It's beyond serious.

57:00.625 --> 57:01.751
How pathetic.

57:01.876 --> 57:03.878
You're making things up now?

57:04.003 --> 57:05.964
Gosh, Dad.

57:06.422 --> 57:08.383
Did you just call him pathetic?

57:09.134 --> 57:10.135
Are you saying

57:10.426 --> 57:12.971
he made that up out of thin air?

57:14.347 --> 57:15.849
Call Ji-hun right now.

57:16.057 --> 57:17.225
I need to find out for myself.

57:17.308 --> 57:18.726
You stay out of it.

57:19.602 --> 57:21.354
I know his situation the best.

57:22.439 --> 57:23.606
I'll take care of it.

57:24.566 --> 57:26.776
-Both of you get out.
-Dad!

58:13.156 --> 58:14.657
-Mom.
-Yes?

58:15.366 --> 58:16.868
Are you very sick?

58:17.035 --> 58:18.453
No, I'm not sick.

58:18.578 --> 58:20.747
Go to sleep. I'm not sick.

58:20.872 --> 58:22.165
-Mom.
-Yes?

58:22.832 --> 58:23.958
Take medication.

58:24.542 --> 58:26.294
Okay, I will.

58:26.711 --> 58:27.921
I'll take medication.

58:38.932 --> 58:42.018
BRAIN TUMOR SYMPTOMS

59:59.304 --> 1:00:00.430

1:00:01.389 --> 1:00:02.390
Yes?

1:00:03.308 --> 1:00:05.768
Are you okay?

1:00:06.102 --> 1:00:07.437
I'm fine.

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:09.897
Let's go to sleep.

1:00:10.732 --> 1:00:12.609
Let's sleep. I'll turn off the light.

1:00:42.472 --> 1:00:43.598
Mom.

1:00:45.975 --> 1:00:47.644
Mom?

1:00:49.062 --> 1:00:50.063
Mom?

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:51.481
Mom.

1:00:52.940 --> 1:00:53.941
Mom?

1:02:02.385 --> 1:02:03.386
Hi, Eun-seong.

1:02:03.845 --> 1:02:05.138

1:02:07.306 --> 1:02:10.017
Yes. She's very sick.

1:02:10.268 --> 1:02:11.853
I keep calling out to her,

1:02:12.186 --> 1:02:13.563
but she won't respond.
