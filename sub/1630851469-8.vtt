WEBVTT

00:09.200 --> 00:11.560
Forged the report from the
Skanda pub bombing.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.560
It's two types of explosives.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.720
Amatex and RM2

00:15.000 --> 00:17.920
Heard about William. What can we do?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.920
When you get out. Anything you
want. Call me and it's yours.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.920
This machine! I asked for hot water, it gives
me coffee! I'm pregnant.

00:26.000 --> 00:26.920
Why are you here?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
I didn't mean to upset you, Miss Vilfort. I'm just
here to support my daughter.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.120
The coordinates are for Copenhagen,

00:33.200 --> 00:34.920
about half a mile from where
Katrine Poulsen was living.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.920
Send those coordinates to the Copenhagen
police.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.720
Beatrice, no. We shouldn't have even been in
Denmark in the first place.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.920
This needs to go to
the Foreign Office.

00:41.000 --> 00:41.920
Fuck the Foreign Office and fuck you.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.920
Torben. Torben! This was not part of the plan.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.360
It's part of it now. I'll deal with Torben.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.960
Say you
were with him all weekend.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.920
You wake up
Monday, he's gone.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Hi, darling. It's me.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.760
I need my morning coffee.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.040
Got you.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.360
This is Torben Jenssen.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.520
Leave a message.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.720
Hi, darling. It's me.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.520
I need my morning coffee.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.600
Hi, where are you?

02:58.760 --> 03:01.240
Please call me when you hear this.

03:01.680 --> 03:02.640
Thanks.

04:26.000 --> 04:26.920
Welcome, Katrine.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.040
Thank you.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Our cyber genius insisted on being
paid in diamonds.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
A piece of sunshine.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
You will meet here.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.640
You make the delivery. You begin the
final phase.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.960
These are not fake.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.200
Give an unhappy woman some hope,

05:21.840 --> 05:23.480
and she is yours

05:23.600 --> 05:25.520
forever.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.960
She's been screwing us the whole
time.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.920
So, the coordinates were for Torben
Jensen's grave?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.920
I knew I should have listened to my gut.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.920
You never really trusted her. None of us did.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.040
Yeah, what did we do with that? We invited
her right in.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.040
So, she reported Torben missing
on Monday morning.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.320
Said he was with her all
weekend.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.920
His watch stopped three days
earlier, when he was buried.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.920
Wait, so Redback never had nothing to do
with bio-fuels?

05:55.000 --> 05:55.920
What?

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Cause Torben was already dead when it was
downloaded, innit.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.040
Fuck.
Do the DSIS know?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.920
Right, do not talk to the Danes. Her boss
might be bent, too.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm only asking.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Just bring Katrine Poulsen in. Keep her there.
I'm gonna take her apart.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Good.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Is this a joke?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.800
I can only apologize for my
technician.

07:05.560 --> 07:09.000
Made for women by men, like the rest
of the world.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
It could have been worse. It could have been a
tampon.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
What you've achieved, it's really quite
something.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I can only say the same.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.120
So many of us have dedicated ourselves to
Redback.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.920
If you should let it slip from your
grasp now...

07:36.000 --> 07:37.040
Nothing's slipping.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.440
William Ogilvy is being released.

07:46.520 --> 07:51.880
Men are
afraid that women will laugh at them.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.920
But
women are afraid that men will kill them.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.920
I'm not afraid of anybody.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.920
You walked into a trap once before.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.960
But here I am.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.920
I'd hate to see my work wasted.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.920
I thought you were concerned for my safety.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.520
A pity... to see you wasted, too.

08:11.600 --> 08:16.960
They'll be a
place in the new world for women like us,

08:17.040 --> 08:19.320
but
currently you're a target.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Leave Ogilvy to me.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.920
You told me we had him. You told me he was
in jail, but William fucking Ogilvy, he's out.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.920
He'll be dealt with. Bring me the worm.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.920
He held a gun to my head and you don't
fucking get away with that.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.920
We are so close, Katrine.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.920
And who's in the firing line?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.920
I will personally make sure William Ogilvy is
taken care of.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.920
No, but I don't want him dead. That's not
enough!

09:08.000 --> 09:10.920
Katrine! Katrine!

09:11.000 --> 09:13.960
Losing his reputation and his freedom, that
will destroy him.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.920
What the hell is this? Do you have the worm?

09:16.000 --> 09:16.920
Of course I have it.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.560
Well then, bring it to me right now!

09:18.640 --> 09:20.920
I have people telling me I couldn't
trust you and I defended you.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.920
You think I will go through all this for nothing?

09:23.080 --> 09:24.920
We are two days away from final phase!

09:25.000 --> 09:27.360
Yeah, and Ogilvy, he's a threat to that.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.920
Without me, there would be no Redback. Are
people aware of that?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
We know. We all know.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.960
I'll take down Ogilvy and then I
bring in the worm.

09:37.040 --> 09:41.040
No! Katrine!

09:41.200 --> 09:42.800
Bitch!

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
This is certainly working in your
favor.

10:52.000 --> 10:52.960
Can we get that taken down?

10:53.040 --> 10:55.920
Has anyone ever explained the internet to
you?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.920
That looks as if we put it up.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.800
That's besides the point. This
daughter stuff

11:00.880 --> 11:02.920
has pumped us up to 52 percent.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.000
What is it?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
It's the DNA results.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
She's not yours?

11:29.000 --> 11:33.040
I was so sure. How am I gonna tell her?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Do you think you should?

11:41.040 --> 11:41.960
What?

11:42.040 --> 11:43.920
This can't come out before the referendum.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.920
She has to know.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.160
Yeah and meanwhile the news spreads.
Of course it will.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.840
She's not gonna be able
to keep it to herself.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.640
It would be unfair to
ask her to.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.400
It's going to look as if you
manipulated the whole thing.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.440
You just barely survived the
deep-fake thing.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.920
We're walking on
a tightrope as it is.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.520
I'll have to talk to Etta.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.200
And what do you think she's gonna
say? Tell Holly.

12:09.280 --> 12:16.000
No. We need to keep this between us,
Adam. Just for now.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.400
Hi, Mikkel

12:22.680 --> 12:23.880
Hi, Katrine.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.360
I have some news.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.320
Is it Torben?

12:30.840 --> 12:32.640
Yes, it's him.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.760
They found his body. It's...

12:37.360 --> 12:38.520
It's not...

12:39.600 --> 12:40.880
Where.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.960
The found him
close to your appartment.

12:44.040 --> 12:44.960
In the woods.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.760
OK.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.680
I've also lost the baby.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.160
Oh, Katrine.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.240
Maybe that's ok.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.280
I don't know what to say.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.880
I'm really sorry to hear that.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.240
Mhm.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.120
Men Beatrice Ogilvy.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.080
she was here.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.160
Katrine, I really think you should
come back.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.200
So...

13:24.320 --> 13:27.320
As soon as I can get to Ogilvy.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.920
They find Torben.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.400
Don't you think it's strange?

13:31.480 --> 13:33.480
I don't know, Katrine.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.240
I'll book a flight for this
evening.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.000
Could you send me the
CCTV pictures from the Skanda pub bomb?

13:39.400 --> 13:40.480
We've been through them already.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.440
Many times. There isn't anything.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.840
Nothing. On the day of the
explosion.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.400
No, but let's go further back.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.600
Mikkel? What if I'm right?

13:50.800 --> 13:53.040
And it is Ogilvy.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.600
Hm?

13:56.720 --> 13:58.880
Please, let me finish this.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.200
Then I'll come home, I promise.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.480
OK.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.200
Strike team dispatched.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.640
Good. Let's get eyes on the hotel,
yeah?

14:17.000 --> 14:17.920
On it

14:18.000 --> 14:18.920
Here we go.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.600
We're bringing in Poulsen
right now.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.640
Strike team is ready to go in.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.360
Beatrice's flight's due in an hour.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.400
I've been briefed.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.160
My office.

14:52.800 --> 14:53.920
Now!

15:03.280 --> 15:06.560
Is that satisfying? Did it
bolster your fragile ego?

15:06.640 --> 15:07.720
I didn't have a choice.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.920
Not every day you get the chance to
incarcerate your boss.

15:11.000 --> 15:11.920
I acted on the evidence!

15:12.000 --> 15:15.640
Evidence! You played straight into
their hands.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.920
Now we're left with our dicks in the
wind.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.920
In hindsight it was the wrong call.

15:20.000 --> 15:26.000
So, tell me what you've cost us. I can't fucking
hear you!

15:28.000 --> 15:28.960
Our Russian agent--

15:29.040 --> 15:36.000
The catastrophic loss of valuable agents.
What else?

15:37.000 --> 15:37.920
Once we bring in Poulsen--

15:38.000 --> 15:40.280
"Once we bring in Poulsen."

15:44.760 --> 15:46.920
If this Redback
happens...

15:47.720 --> 15:51.520
I will hold you personally to
account.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.160
What?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.040
Nothing.

16:09.000 --> 16:09.920
How's William?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.960
Let's just focus on Katrine, yeah? Where are
we at?

16:12.040 --> 16:15.920
Got her hotel. Her PDA's active. Room 311.
Third floor.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.920
Getting comms up now. OK. We're live.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.920
Is the building fully secure?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.920
Eight officers standing by.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.920
Body cams, please.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.040
Yeah.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
OK, let's go.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.920
Entering the building.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.920
Beatrice will be gutted she's missing this.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Crossing to reception.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.040
Let's keep eyes peeled on all exits
now. First floor landing.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.040
Did you forget something.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Second floor.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.680
No number plates.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.920
Preceding to third floor.

17:34.000 --> 17:34.920
Third-floor corridor. Bring it up.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Got it. OK.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.760
Arriving at the target's room.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.800
Preparing for entry.

17:53.040 --> 18:00.560
Five, four, three...
two, one.

18:00.640 --> 18:03.920
Go, go, go!

18:04.040 --> 18:06.960
Armed Police!
Get on the ground!

18:07.040 --> 18:08.960
Go on. Through there. Through there.
Get in there.

18:09.040 --> 18:09.920
Hello?

18:10.000 --> 18:10.920
Police!

18:11.000 --> 18:14.720
Where the fuck is she?
Have you got her?

18:14.800 --> 18:16.760
Negative. No contact made.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.760
Eight sodding men?

18:18.840 --> 18:19.920
What have you got?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.440
That's her PDA.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.880
She booked a hotel room for her PDA.

18:28.960 --> 18:32.000
Fuck!

18:37.040 --> 18:38.840
Fuck.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.920
Beatrice. You made some progress.
Copenhagen.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Yes.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.040
Keep me informed.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
When did you get out?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
This morning.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
You're welcome.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.240
Who are you?

20:54.400 --> 20:56.080
I said, who are you?

20:56.160 --> 20:58.680
I thought the house was empty. I'm
hungry.

20:58.760 --> 21:03.000
Bullshit! You're that little Danish
spook!

21:06.880 --> 21:09.800
What is this, huh?

21:17.200 --> 21:19.600
Who sent you?
Talk!

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Are you running away?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Who sent you?

21:27.840 --> 21:29.240
You know who sent me.

21:33.840 --> 21:36.080
We've been
investigating William Ogilvy.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.600
Bullshit. Huh?

21:41.400 --> 21:44.240
You drugged me. You
fucking bitch!

21:45.040 --> 21:50.000
You get your meds mixed up?

21:54.000 --> 21:58.920
Adam? Holly hasn't been in touch. Have you
heard from her?

21:59.000 --> 22:04.920
I'd have to check my voicemails. I'll call her
tonight. Why? Are you worried about her?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.960
Oh, I can't bear what this is turning me into.
It's why I didn't wanna have kids.

22:08.040 --> 22:08.920
I know.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.920
I'll be the one doing packed lunches, vetting
the Insta accounts.

22:12.000 --> 22:12.920
I care about Holly too.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.920
I know you do.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.320
Meeting starts at three, Adam. We
should really--

22:16.400 --> 22:17.480
Yeah, just a minute.

22:18.480 --> 22:21.920
Don't make me responsible for your
relationship with your daughter.

22:24.720 --> 22:25.680
What is it?

22:26.560 --> 22:28.280
Nothing. Big day.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.920
Eyes on the prize.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
What is it?

22:46.040 --> 22:48.000
And freeze.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.920
The elusive Dane.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Mm.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.960
How was the flight?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.920
It didn't crash.

22:57.000 --> 22:57.920
Danish police have been in touch.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.920
Yeah, I stole some evidence.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.920
They would like it back.

23:01.000 --> 23:01.920
When I'm done with it.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Got something.

23:06.000 --> 23:06.920
Right, when was this?

23:07.000 --> 23:07.920
Two hours ago.

23:08.000 --> 23:08.920
Thought we had her.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.920
Yeah, in the hotel. So, where does she go
from here?

23:12.000 --> 23:12.920
West on Priory Road.

23:13.000 --> 23:13.920
Then what?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.640
Nothing. No working cameras.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.120
Look, the forensic report from her
flat in Copenhagen,

23:18.200 --> 23:20.360
can you chase it up? And as
soon as you get it, bring it to me.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.480
Of course.

23:22.760 --> 23:23.600
Hello?

23:23.680 --> 23:28.000
Beatrice? It's Holly. Er, sorry, I
didn't know who else to call.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.760
What can I do for you?

23:30.840 --> 23:34.800
I know this is out of the blue but
you sent me your number.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.800
I've come to London
to see my dad but the press,

23:37.880 --> 23:40.480
they won't leave
me alone. They're everywhere.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.920
Look, Holly, you should call Adam. He's your
dad.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.960
I... I have. He's not picking up. I've left
messages, I didn't know who else to call.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.000
Holly, where are you now?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.840
Are you ready to tell the truth?

24:07.240 --> 24:09.760
William Ogilvy used you.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.880
You know he
was arrested?

24:17.960 --> 24:20.160
Of course you do.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.080
You're just like
me.

24:23.160 --> 24:27.040
I mean, you've always got one packed

24:27.120 --> 24:29.720
and you're ready to run.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.680
But you're
not stupid.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.200
You must have worked it out by now.

24:42.200 --> 24:44.920
Ogilvy worked both sides.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.760
And the
Russians, they decided it was time to cash up.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.760
The Skanda bomb, that
was Russian destabilization.

25:04.320 --> 25:07.680
The day before
the explosion, you walked into the pub

25:07.760 --> 25:12.760
carrying a big heavy bag and
when you walked out it was empty.

25:15.160 --> 25:18.480
Do you think he'd
show you the same loyalty?

25:20.160 --> 25:24.000
We hacked his phone.
Do you know what he called you?

25:25.040 --> 25:28.800
He called you a deniable commodity.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
He gave the order.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.040
Who did?

25:43.440 --> 25:44.400
William.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.360
William Ogilvy gave me the
order. He gave the order.

25:53.280 --> 25:57.000
He gave the order.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.000
Hello. Will you put me through to the Prime
Minister's office?

26:14.280 --> 26:16.560
Hang on.

26:18.920 --> 26:22.280
OK. I can talk.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.240
I know they found Torben and I know
you all think it was me,

26:25.320 --> 26:27.040
but I'm being framed, Levi.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.000
Ogilvy is not working for Russia, I
know that,

26:32.080 --> 26:35.920
<i>but I've got something on him that</i>
<i>will put him back inside.</i>

26:36.000 --> 26:36.920
What?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.040
<i>You don't believe me?</i>

26:38.120 --> 26:41.080
Ogilvy, he held
a gun to my head because he knew I was on to him.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.240
And you saw it. You saw the fucking
gun.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.840
Yeah. I saw the gun.

26:44.920 --> 26:48.560
So, you know what he's capable of.
He's putting Torben's murder on me.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.920
That's a hell of an accusation.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.320
That's just the start.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.040
Why are you bringing this to me?

26:53.120 --> 26:55.320
Because you know. You know how
dangerous he is.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.840
I'm not ending up as collateral.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.560
How
about you?

27:00.640 --> 27:06.360
Do you think he wouldn't kill you?
Levi. I'll give you the evidence,

27:06.440 --> 27:09.560
but you have to come alone.
Say you'll come alone.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.560
OK. I'll come alone.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.960
No backup. No Beatrice. Nobody.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.000
Levi... I'm trusting you with my
life.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.360
Where?

27:21.000 --> 27:23.720
I'll send you the location.
Meet me in one hour.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Where are you going?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.920
Yesterday it was fuck you, today it's small
talk?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.240
Who just called you?

27:57.320 --> 28:00.840
It was Katrine,
wasn't it? You're going to meet her.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.040
That's the location,
isn't it?

28:05.120 --> 28:08.400
Look, you do know she's not gonna be
there, don't you?

28:08.480 --> 28:10.920
If you're going somewhere, you've got
to take me with you. This is mine.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.320
Obviously she won't be there. This is
a test to see if she can trust me or not,

28:14.400 --> 28:18.480
so if you're tagging along,
you're gonna blow any play I can make.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.720
Look, does she know what you're gonna
do later?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.760
Yes. She knows I've got fives tonight
in Clapham.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.280
That's where she'll show up.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.400
Why did she bring this to you?

28:25.480 --> 28:27.480
Because she's got something on your
father

28:27.560 --> 28:30.600
and she sees someone else who's been
an Ogilvy punchbag.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.040
Look, we can't go rogue on this.

28:33.120 --> 28:36.000
"We?" Since when was this a "we"
thing?

28:36.080 --> 28:37.600
We've got to take this to William.

28:37.680 --> 28:38.440
Sure.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.280
Footsloggers follow the rules,

28:40.360 --> 28:43.280
so people like William
can do whatever they want.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.600
He'll
kill her. You know that?

28:44.680 --> 28:45.520
Oh, come on. Don't be insane.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.880
Does he often dine with a hang gun on
the dinner table?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.520
If she has evidence against
William, I wanna see it.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.000
She killed her partner.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.040
She says she was framed to protect
your dad.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.000
Beatrice? You said to bring this soon
as.

28:59.080 --> 28:59.920
What is it?

29:00.000 --> 29:03.040
Traces of a VX nerve agent found
inside a Copenhagen flat of Katrine Poulsen.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.200
Thank you.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.280
VX traces in her flat.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.440
She's working with Oleg Adamov.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.680
Levi...

29:18.760 --> 29:20.920
We need to do this to William.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
Hey... I know I've been treating you like shit.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.040
Yeah.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
My dad preferred you.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.920
Bees and wasps, innit.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
No. He thought you were the best person for
the job.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I've had a call from Katrine Poulsen.

29:56.000 --> 29:56.920
What does she want?

29:57.000 --> 30:03.040
To meet. She sent her location. She won't be
there. There's too many vantage points.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Interesting that she should contact you.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
She reckons she's got information that could
put you back inside.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.920
And she thought you were the ideal person to
assist with that?

30:17.000 --> 30:21.920
Look, assuming the first location is a test, we
think she'll intercept Levi later tonight.

30:22.000 --> 30:22.960
Where?

30:23.040 --> 30:25.920
Clapham Sports just before six.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.880
Right. Make sure she gets a good look
at you.

30:28.960 --> 30:32.560
You make the grab at second location.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.440
Get me Special Branch, please.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.040
Etta Cornwell's expecting us.

30:58.040 --> 31:05.920
A lot of responsibility. Investigating someone
who shall remain nameless.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
I was just part of a team. A very junior part, so.

31:12.000 --> 31:12.920
Who was it?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
You can't ask that!

31:15.000 --> 31:16.040
It wasn't my dad, was it?

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
No, no. Not your dad, no. No.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Well, I'll give you my number.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.920
I've-I've already got it.

31:28.000 --> 31:28.960
What?

31:29.040 --> 31:34.000
Beatrice gave it to me. In case, in case
I couldn't find you, so...

31:36.000 --> 31:37.920
Not looking for a date or anything.

31:38.000 --> 31:38.920
It's totally practical, so.

31:39.000 --> 31:39.920
After what happened...

31:40.000 --> 31:40.960
You might need help, so.

31:41.040 --> 31:45.960
Holly? I wish you would have called us before
bothering MI5.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.000
I left messages for Adam.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.920
Oh. Well, come on up. I've put fresh towels
out.

31:52.000 --> 31:52.920
They took my bag.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Don't worry. We'll get it sent up.

31:56.040 --> 31:59.000
I should warn you, I'm pretty good at getting
secrets out of people.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.640
I got a call from Levi.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.280
No show. Big
surprise.

32:40.360 --> 32:41.800
So, there are four possible routes

32:41.880 --> 32:44.160
that Katrine could take to get to the
sports center.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.960
What's
happened?

32:48.240 --> 32:51.520
Kelvin Cruickshanks. A note's been
found among his possessions,

32:51.600 --> 32:54.240
suggesting you bear
responsibility for Laird's death.

32:56.440 --> 32:58.280
Special
Branch are here to interview you.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.800
I can't deal with this now.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.360
No choice. DG wants it tied off.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.760
So, who's going out?

33:05.840 --> 33:07.600
I've put a team together.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.640
Well, play it again. Play it again.

33:17.720 --> 33:20.200
Why don't you just fuck off back to
Westminster

33:20.280 --> 33:22.280
and we'll make up our own
minds?

33:22.360 --> 33:24.920
Well, we always knew we were going to
get a bit of hostility.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.120
Have you seen this?

33:26.200 --> 33:29.680
"Number one reasons for Scots
intending to vote against independence."

33:29.760 --> 33:30.920
They love the English?

33:31.000 --> 33:33.080
Shockingly no. It's your ploy.

33:33.160 --> 33:36.040
Full
economic, legal and military independence

33:36.120 --> 33:38.920
at the stroke
of midnight. It'll scare the crap out of them.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.240
I'm a genius.

33:40.320 --> 33:41.920
Stable genius.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.920
Turns out getting back into the EU
isn't such a big deal.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.280
Ah, now we are thinking,

33:47.360 --> 33:51.920
low-key, semi-triumphant for
tomorrow's round of interviews.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.680
Wonderful. Holly's upstairs.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.560
An MI5 officer brought her back this
afternoon.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.800
She phoned them when she couldn't get
a hold of you.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.120
Why?

34:02.200 --> 34:04.760
I don't know, Adam. Maybe she needed
someone to rescue her.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.360
OK. Well, we just have a couple of,
um...

34:14.480 --> 34:18.240
The referendum is tomorrow, Etta.
What do you expect me to do?

34:21.680 --> 34:24.280
Kelvin Cruickshanks was suffering
from PTSD,

34:25.800 --> 34:28.880
so that's how I account for his
allegations.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.560
We have force. We have the law.

34:31.640 --> 34:36.000
We're the number one intelligence
service in the world. The idea that we would use...

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
What were you saying?

34:47.000 --> 34:51.880
That we would use unsanctioned
methods is...

34:56.560 --> 34:58.000
Sorry. You're gonna have to excuse
me.

34:58.080 --> 35:01.280
Well, it's that or I piss on the
floor, so....

35:13.680 --> 35:15.400
Marcus, I need to make a call,

35:15.480 --> 35:18.560
but I
need you to make it come from this number.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.000
I'm sending
you the details now.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.920
Yes. Still looking to expand. What time?

35:45.000 --> 35:45.920
Have you seen Katrine?

35:46.000 --> 35:53.000
Estate agent. Just a moment. Give me
the address. Mm-hm.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.920
She doesn't answer the phone.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
What can you tell me about the
property?

36:01.000 --> 36:04.120
When did you see Katrine last?

36:06.120 --> 36:07.840
Give an unhappy woman some hope

36:07.920 --> 36:09.120
and she is yours?

36:09.640 --> 36:11.560
Maybe it isn't enough?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Keep moving. We have you covered.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.040
Got her. She's on xxx road.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
Proceed through the park. We'll intercept on
the other side.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.360
Get in the car.

37:10.440 --> 37:13.360
William and his
backup are two minutes away. Get in the fucking car.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.800
You're driving.

37:25.040 --> 37:30.920
Shit! Shit. William, she's gone.

37:31.000 --> 37:31.960
What?

37:32.040 --> 37:34.920
She got into a car with Beatrice and drove off.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Fuck! Fuck!

37:49.040 --> 37:51.920
Move. Go on.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.400
What the hell is this?

37:53.480 --> 37:55.040
Get in there.

38:02.760 --> 38:04.120
Move.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.280
Sit down.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.600
Sit down!

38:36.000 --> 38:39.960
Is that Torben's? I know he's dead. Michael
called me.

38:40.040 --> 38:43.000
That is a performance I would loved to have
seen.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.800
Hi darling. It's me.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.600
I need my morning coffee.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.040
Nice touch.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.960
I'm being set up because of what I
know about your father.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.800
God, don't you ever stop?

38:58.880 --> 39:01.240
Torben's body turns up the second
William's arrested.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.360
Don't you think it's a bit of a
coincidence?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.280
What are you looking for?

39:08.360 --> 39:10.840
Shit. Take your jacket off.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.640
Take your fucking jacket off now!

39:32.000 --> 39:34.920
Let me show you what your father's capable
of. It's on my phone.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
I'm not interested.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Is that William?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Estate agent.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.160
Go on. Get over there, with your
friend.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.400
Move.

40:33.800 --> 40:36.080
Now...

40:37.040 --> 40:40.760
One of you two is gonna
tell me what Redback is.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.720
I heard Oleg Adamov in your
office.

40:51.960 --> 40:55.440
I think my father got really close
and you set up that raid to get rid of him.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.480
What is
Redback?

41:00.560 --> 41:01.440
This is insane.

41:01.520 --> 41:02.880
Don't say anything.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.400
I was saying, tell her what you know.

41:05.480 --> 41:06.600
In English!

41:09.440 --> 41:11.160
I should have trusted my
instincts about you.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.920
How could you when every thought has
been shaped by Daddy?

41:14.000 --> 41:17.400
Oh, wow! I'm being lectured by Oleg
Adamov's sock puppet!

41:17.480 --> 41:18.880
I'm the puppet?

41:19.000 --> 41:21.560
We found VX traces in your flat.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.360
They'd do anything to frame me.

41:25.640 --> 41:29.000
I think, when your sister died...

41:29.080 --> 41:30.120
Don't talk about my sister.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.640
...you just grabbed the opportunity
to spread more poison.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.760
Well, you know what? A lot of
people live through tragedy,

41:34.840 --> 41:37.360
but they don't kill their lover.
They don't betray their country!

41:37.440 --> 41:40.080
And they don't allow a woman to burn
to death!

41:41.160 --> 41:43.560
I mean, how could you let them do
that?

41:43.640 --> 41:46.440
Especially when it's how your sister
died!

41:51.280 --> 41:54.120
I'm giving you the opportunity to put
things right.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.960
You think you're with the good guys?

41:57.040 --> 41:58.920
Well, I'm not planning a terror attack!

41:59.000 --> 42:00.920
Let me show you what your father did.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.920
Oh, God, you're just-- You'll say anything,
won't you?

42:05.000 --> 42:06.920
You can't look at the evidence because what
would that mean to you?

42:07.000 --> 42:07.920
This is desperate.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.920
Everything you do is for William.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.920
Everything I do is to protect my country.

42:12.000 --> 42:12.920
To protect your father.

42:13.000 --> 42:13.920
You betrayed your country.

42:14.000 --> 42:14.920
You betrayed yourself.

42:15.000 --> 42:15.920
No.

42:16.000 --> 42:16.920
The man is corrupt.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.920
-You killed. You murdered.
-He's evil and you cover for him.

42:19.000 --> 42:19.920
No.

42:20.000 --> 42:20.920
Because what else have you got?

42:21.000 --> 42:23.920
This is pathetic! These wild allegations.

42:24.000 --> 42:24.920
I saw you... I saw you hiding the gun.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.920
I saw your boyfriend, Torben, in a shallow
grave.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.920
What else have you done for him? What else
have you done for him?

42:30.000 --> 42:30.920
You... You fucking put him there!

42:31.000 --> 42:31.920
What else have you done for him?

42:32.000 --> 42:32.920
No, you fucking put--

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
What else?

42:39.000 --> 42:40.920
I thought we were on the same page.

42:41.000 --> 42:41.960
I reacted to new information.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.000
You gonna tell me what happened?

42:45.000 --> 42:47.960
Today is the big day. The polling stations are
open.

42:48.040 --> 42:52.920
I was wondering about the DNA results. Will
you be disappointed if I'm Adam's daughter?

42:53.000 --> 42:54.920
God, no. I'd be delighted.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.920
We had a strategy. You sabotaged it. Why?

42:58.000 --> 42:58.960
Why do you think?

42:59.040 --> 43:00.920
I wanted her sitting there, not you.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.040
I mean, even with a gun to her head, she
doesn't talk, does she?

43:04.000 --> 43:09.920
We've been sent the DNA results. Adam
Cornwell isn't your father.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.920
It was my call not to tell her.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.920
Holly should have been told the moment that
you knew!

43:14.000 --> 43:14.920
We didn't know the results would leak.

43:15.000 --> 43:15.920
It doesn't matter!

43:16.000 --> 43:17.920
What was your role in the Skanda bombing?

43:18.000 --> 43:19.920
I vowed to protect the union.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.920
You killed people who you vowed to protect!

43:24.000 --> 43:24.960
Well, this is massive.

43:25.040 --> 43:27.040
Tell me that's another deep-fake recording.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.920
Emotions are fragile.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.960
Holding them
together takes strength

43:34.040 --> 43:37.520
and courage, and
self-sacrifice.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.120
