02:01.580 --> 02:05.494
You can't do this, you
don't have to do this.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.578
You don't have to do
this, man, please don't.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.625
Why are you doing this?

02:11.632 --> 02:14.124
We didn't do anything.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.469
We didn't do anything, why
are you doing this to us?

02:19.556 --> 02:22.594
What are you doing?

02:22.601 --> 02:24.684
Babe, babe, please don't!

02:30.400 --> 02:32.357
It's in the house, please.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.782
This is supposed to
be our check-in, right?

04:03.785 --> 04:06.277
Yeah, that's what they said.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.371
Hmm, I guess the door's open.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.378
Hello?

04:22.053 --> 04:23.669
We're here for the noon check-in.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.679
Guess we'll make ourselves at home then.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.129
Hey.

06:20.881 --> 06:21.881
Hey.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.049
You were definitely right

06:24.050 --> 06:25.712
about this being your dream home.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.801
They're amazing photographers.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.425
They work as photojournalists
down in Mexico.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.430
I haven't been in one
of these since college.

06:41.985 --> 06:42.818
Looks like the owners were

06:42.819 --> 06:44.685
in the middle of developing something.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.988
There's still a negative
in here, check this out.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.846
Oh, they're here.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.199
Hi.
- Hi, hi.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.862
I can't believe you're here.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.280
- I missed you.
- I know.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.119
Wow, your hair got so long.

07:36.122 --> 07:36.956
Look at you, you look great.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.789
Oh please, you're glowing.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.579
Thank you, I've been
on this juice cleanse

07:40.585 --> 07:42.747
this past month, turmeric,
charcoal, it works.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.416
Babe, I'm sweating
my balls, off, come on.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.038
- Well then come in then.
- Wow.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.290
This is what I'm talking about.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.962
Yeah, hey baby, hey,

07:48.969 --> 07:51.461
say hi to Sarah, my high school bestie.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.178
- Hi, hi.
- How are you?

07:53.181 --> 07:55.047
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey dude, my name's Joe.

07:55.058 --> 07:55.975
- Victor.
- Nice to meet you.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.808
- Oh, I got you guys this.
- Thank you.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.143
Thank you so much.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.471
- You guys know each other.
- How are you?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.847
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.019
So, bedroom's are this way?

08:05.026 --> 08:06.437
- Hey.
- Oh yeah, hi.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.356
Let me show you to your room,
you can drop off your bags.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.820
Down here and to the right, yeah.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.940
It's a little messy but...

08:20.959 --> 08:21.959
I still don't understand why

08:21.960 --> 08:23.622
we couldn't just come here alone.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.249
Come on, you know why.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.834
I think it's really good for
us to be around other people.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.085
Come here.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.212
Talk about the middle of nowhere, right?

08:36.975 --> 08:37.975
Yeah.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.888
So, what's the plan, Joey boy?

08:40.895 --> 08:44.104
We gonna go and find some
weird strip clubs or something?

08:44.107 --> 08:46.394
Strip clubs, really?

08:46.401 --> 08:47.858
Yeah, maybe they're hiring.

08:47.861 --> 08:48.897
That's funny.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.813
How'd you guys find this place?

08:53.742 --> 08:57.611
I just found it online, kinda got lucky.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.828
We don't need to watch
out for border hoppers?

08:59.831 --> 09:00.992
Jesus, babe.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.293
I'm kidding.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.745
They can have it anyway, the
whole country's going to shit.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.749
All I know is I won't be
sober when the world ends.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.251
- I will drink to that.
- Hell yes.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.094
Thank you.

09:14.095 --> 09:14.928
All right.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.670
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:21.936 --> 09:26.931
Woo.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.726
Well, what do you expect?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.773
Giving a junior developer admin

09:31.780 --> 09:34.318
access to a live database
on his first day.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.735
Yeah, totally, man.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.329
Carnage.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.993
Babe, what the fuck?

09:42.999 --> 09:45.036
We better ration ourselves, huh?

09:45.043 --> 09:46.454
We've got the weekend, yeah?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.628
Like a fucking vacuum, this one.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.427
Sorry man, you want a hit?

09:57.430 --> 09:58.671
I'm good, thank you.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.845
I'm fine, I appreciate
it though, it's all you.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.639
Okay, I get it, I totally get it.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.221
I used to be pussy-whipped myself.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.314
Oh, no, you can't smoke in here.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.732
What?

10:14.739 --> 10:16.230
You're joking, right?
- Yeah.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.158
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.699
Hey, how you doing over here?

10:22.705 --> 10:23.866
What are you lookin' at?

10:23.873 --> 10:25.205
I'm just looking at this book.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.751
Isn't this place so nice?

10:27.752 --> 10:30.995
I love it so much, I wish
I never had to leave.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.998
Honey, enjoy the dream while it lasts.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.044
I guess.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.883
So how long you guys been together?

10:37.887 --> 10:40.846
Well, she's gonna say a year but

10:40.849 --> 10:42.511
I'd say like three or four months.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.642
- Hey.
- Had you guys met up?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.853
I'm really sorry we
haven't been in touch.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.691
Hey, it's okay, life happens.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.232
Sooner or later, we all
have to grow up, right?

10:55.238 --> 10:58.572
I know but growing up doesn't
mean we don't talk anymore.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.988
I should have reached out, I'm sorry.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.485
It's just been a really
strange year for me.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.613
Literally be
anywhere in the world...

11:05.623 --> 11:07.205
I know, babe.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.541
Like half an hour later...

11:09.544 --> 11:13.163
If you wanna talk about
it, I'm here for you.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.374
Thank you, I'm good.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.125
I don't wanna talk about it.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.468
I just wanna

11:19.470 --> 11:23.384
have fun and forget that
the world exists for a bit.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.470
I can help you with that.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.434
I know, that's why you're here.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.895
Come here, have a bowl.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.479
Oh my god, I love this album.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.485
Yes,

11:36.529 --> 11:39.112
are you ready to dance with me?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.449
Ooh, you're gonna love this.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.829
Oh, yeah.

11:46.831 --> 11:50.541
Oh yeah, come on, dance with me, come on.

11:52.587 --> 11:53.587
Woo.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.746
Oh, oh, oh,

11:55.757 --> 11:56.757

Keep fucking

15:18.126 --> 15:19.207
- Yes.
- Yeah?

15:31.264 --> 15:32.926
That's right.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.013
That's right.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.038
Die young and leave a pretty corpse.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.661
I've got way too
many bad habits as it is.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.672
Suit yourself.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.384
Yeah, well.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.054
Did you get a good look?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.315
So what are we gonna do about

16:26.319 --> 16:29.062
this little predicament of ours?

16:30.490 --> 16:31.490
Do?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.320
We're not gonna do shit.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.989
We're gonna keep our mouths shut.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.243
So nothing happened, right?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.241
Nothing happened.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.992
I got way too drunk, stupidly hooked up

16:44.003 --> 16:47.246
with some girl I had no
business being with, the end.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.426
The end.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.597
Wow.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.341
Well, enjoy the view.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.797
How'd they turn out?

17:30.800 --> 17:31.800
Good.

17:33.803 --> 17:34.803
I'm pretty good.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.884
Wanna see?

17:38.891 --> 17:39.891
Yeah.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.605
Dork.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.865
Hey, I'm sorry things got weird earlier.

17:56.867 --> 18:00.781
I mean I know that they
got weird, I'm just sorry.

18:14.844 --> 18:15.677
What the fuck was that?

18:15.678 --> 18:17.260
Why would
someone be here so late?

18:17.263 --> 18:18.470
Fuck if I know.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.963
I don't know,
I can't see who it is.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.341
Well, that's why you open
the door, to see who it is.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.184
What?

18:23.185 --> 18:25.302
No, don't, don't answer the soor.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.599
Babe, it's fine.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.606
Shit.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.524
You're not Melissa, I'm sorry.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.618
I was expecting Melissa, is she home?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.203
No, no, she's not.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.288
Is Michael, then?

18:45.291 --> 18:46.998
We're renting
from them this weekend.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.788
So they're not here.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.706
Ah, I see, I see.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.295
Everything all right, Sarah?

18:52.298 --> 18:54.210
Who's that?

18:55.176 --> 18:56.587
That's my husband.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.929
Oh, so you're Sarah, it's
nice to meet you, Sarah.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.344
I am so sorry for banging on your door

19:03.351 --> 19:05.638
this late at night but I'm the neighbor

19:05.645 --> 19:07.762
and my car broke down just down the road

19:07.772 --> 19:11.607
and I just, I thought oh, thank God,

19:11.609 --> 19:12.975
Melissa's place is
right around the corner.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.726
So I popped by and I was wondering

19:14.737 --> 19:16.694
if I could just use
the phone really quick?

19:16.697 --> 19:19.781
Because my boy is at
home with the babysitter

19:19.784 --> 19:22.026
and at this point, I'm like, I don't know,

19:22.036 --> 19:24.198
an hour away, trying to
fix the car of course

19:24.205 --> 19:28.165
and I'm pretty much desperate
to get ahold of them.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.783
Sure.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.535
You can use my cell phone.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.411
Oh, there's no reception out here

19:33.422 --> 19:36.586
unfortunately in the desert.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.634
The middle of nowhere, you know?

19:39.637 --> 19:40.470
Right.

19:40.471 --> 19:43.555
I promise you I will be two seconds

19:43.557 --> 19:45.344
and then I will be out of your hair.

19:46.477 --> 19:49.641
Could you let me, could
you just hang on one second?

19:49.647 --> 19:50.979
Please, don't, please, please.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.689
It's just I would be so fast.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.809
Just one sec.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.110
It's the middle of the night.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.113
Is this really what you
want to be doing right now?

20:07.123 --> 20:08.364
Come on, man, you'd expect

20:08.374 --> 20:09.455
anyone to do the same thing for you.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.542
I don't expect anything
from anyone, ever.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.161
She obviously knows
the owners of the house.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.878
She just needs to make a call.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.622
She has a broken down
car with kids at home.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.466
- Bullshit.
- You know what?

20:18.467 --> 20:19.583
Help somebody else out for once.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.552
You don't want her to come in,

20:20.553 --> 20:22.135
why don't you go fix her car instead?

20:22.138 --> 20:23.219
I want us to go back five minutes

20:23.222 --> 20:24.804
and leave the fucking door closed.

20:24.807 --> 20:25.807
One call.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.060
Two seconds.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.104
Sorry to keep you waiting.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.317
You know,

20:37.278 --> 20:41.022
finding truly kind people
in this world today

20:41.031 --> 20:44.991
is like finding a diamond
in a sea of glass.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.287
The phone's right back there.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.745
Thank you so much.

20:49.707 --> 20:50.540
Hi.

20:50.541 --> 20:51.541
Hi.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.833
Good evening.

20:53.836 --> 20:54.836
Pardon me.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.979
Hey, what's going on with you now?

21:22.865 --> 21:24.857
Well, she's
just gonna make a call.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.278
So we'll just wait.

21:27.328 --> 21:28.614
Okay.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.203
But if you're tired, you can go to bed.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.118
You don't have to stay up.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.662
No, it's cool, I'll hang with you.

21:34.668 --> 21:35.668
Come here.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.880
Remember when we used to have sleepovers?

21:41.050 --> 21:42.461
Our parents would hate it 'cause

21:42.468 --> 21:44.585
you would just eat all of our food.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.507
Well, you had the best snacks.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.595
That is true.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.308
Wow, are you okay?

21:53.687 --> 21:54.687
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.978
You don't have to be
here if you don't want.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.067
You can go in another room too, you know.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.189
Thanks, but you don't
have to tell me what to do.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.406
I'm not.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.990
Yeah, you clearly are.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.778
Wee bit of trouble in paradise?

22:11.789 --> 22:14.156
I apologize, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.782
I couldn't help but overhearing.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.626
You know my husband and I,

22:18.629 --> 22:21.918
we used to go at it pretty
regular and it got ugly.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.382
But you know what got us through?

22:24.385 --> 22:26.377
It didn't matter what
happened during the day,

22:26.387 --> 22:30.427
how much we fought, we always
prayed together at night.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.349
You've gotta cherish the good.

22:34.937 --> 22:38.556
A man hath no greater thing
under the sun than to eat,

22:38.566 --> 22:40.478
to drink and to be merry.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.564
But we're divorced now.

22:44.572 --> 22:48.657
I had to jump off that
train, it was the express.

22:48.659 --> 22:49.866
I learned the hard way.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.994
One cannot live in bad faith.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.623
But she is right, you know?

22:57.626 --> 23:00.460
You do have to communicate.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.078
How'd that call go?

23:02.089 --> 23:04.547
Perfect, I spoke to my boy

23:04.550 --> 23:08.294
and the babysitter is tucking him in, so.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.304
How old is he?

23:10.389 --> 23:14.349
He just turned seven,
he's my little baby cakes.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.638
- That's a fun age.
- It is.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.807
You know, you'd love him, he is,

23:20.190 --> 23:21.397
he's something else.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.112
Can I ask,

23:28.574 --> 23:29.815
why did you guys divorce?

23:33.037 --> 23:34.037
Well,

23:36.206 --> 23:38.414
sometimes you just can't
stop what's coming.

23:40.002 --> 23:43.621
At the end of the day, he can lie to you

23:43.631 --> 23:48.092
and you can lie to him but
you can't lie to yourself.

23:53.474 --> 23:57.514
Goodness, you know I was so
relieved to hear his voice,

23:57.519 --> 24:00.728
I completely forgot to call the tow truck

24:00.731 --> 24:04.520
and here I am prattling
on like God knows what.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.818
I am sorry.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.316
No.

24:09.323 --> 24:10.323
Please.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.033
It's late, late, late, late.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.870
So I'll make that call and
then I'll be out of your hair.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.747
I should go check on Victor.

24:27.758 --> 24:28.758
Okay.

24:35.224 --> 24:38.217
No offense but I'd rather
stick my dick in a cactus

24:38.227 --> 24:39.388
than get marriage counseling from some

24:39.395 --> 24:41.978
fucking middle of the night drifter, okay?

24:41.981 --> 24:44.940
She's actually not that
bad, she's kinda sweet.

24:44.942 --> 24:45.775
What?

24:45.776 --> 24:48.519
Yeah, it's Joe and Sarah
who are being fucking weird.

24:48.529 --> 24:49.529
No shit.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.108
Babe, just come back out
there so I'm not alone, okay?

24:54.118 --> 24:55.118
Nah.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.156
I'm gonna smoke this and then go to bed.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.119
You know you're not
going to sleep right now.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.614
Come on, let's have fun.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.083
I promise I'll make it up to you.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.702
- Oh yeah?
- Mm hmm.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.170
How are you gonna do that?

25:07.172 --> 25:09.664
I'll do that thing you like.

25:10.968 --> 25:12.209
All right.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.052
Babe.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.169
But only 'cause you're so cute.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.761
But Mary Poppins has gotta go.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.635
Fine with me, just promise me

25:18.642 --> 25:21.225
you won't do it like an asshole, okay?

25:21.228 --> 25:23.971
And all this time, I thought
that's why you liked me.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.184
Round up the party favors 'cause

25:29.194 --> 25:30.981
we're gonna need 'em with these two.

25:36.410 --> 25:39.118
Come on guys, while we're
still breathing please.

25:40.247 --> 25:43.331
I'm trying to have a party,
fuckin' woman in the house.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.701
Dude, relax, you're
gonna have a heart attack.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.624
Dude, shut the fuck up.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.122
Don't tell me what to do, all right?

25:52.843 --> 25:54.379
She's almost done, okay?

25:55.971 --> 25:58.133
Well, she's got two minutes

25:58.140 --> 26:00.553
and then I'm pulling
the plug on this shit.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.973
Yep, just me and four
of my lovely new friends.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.398
We'll be here.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.650
Mm hmm.

26:10.652 --> 26:11.652
Hello?

26:12.362 --> 26:13.362
Hello?

26:17.868 --> 26:19.484
I can't seem to get any reception.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.202
Is there something wrong with the phone?

26:21.205 --> 26:22.412
No, you're fine there.

26:25.209 --> 26:27.542
Do you mind if I try in another room?

26:27.544 --> 26:29.501
Yeah, sure, try the studio.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.968
Wow, you really wear the
pants in the relationship, huh?

26:37.971 --> 26:40.088
Knock that shit off, man.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.137
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.884
Tension in the air.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.229
Oh Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.397
You know Sarah, sometimes it's good

26:52.402 --> 26:54.735
to let a guy be a guy, you know?

26:54.738 --> 26:56.900
Have an opinion, speak for himself...

26:56.907 --> 26:58.193
Victor, shut up.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.907
All right, I'm just saying.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.618
I'm here all night if you
need some advice, okay?

27:18.345 --> 27:21.088
They're beautiful, aren't they?

27:27.354 --> 27:30.722
Yeah, I guess, I don't really know.

27:30.732 --> 27:32.268
You know, some Native American people

27:32.276 --> 27:36.987
believe that taking a
photograph can steal a soul,

27:36.989 --> 27:41.734
imprisoning it forever in this
brew of celluloid and salt.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.076
Some tribes spend their whole

27:44.079 --> 27:46.071
lives avoiding being photographed.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.453
Have you seen any of their other works?

27:50.502 --> 27:53.791
No, I don't really have an
eye for this sort of thing.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.959
Sarah's the artist.

27:57.551 --> 27:58.632
I don't think I've ever been

27:58.635 --> 28:00.752
in a house with this much beautiful art.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.017
I thought you knew the owners?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.511
I do.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.521
Why?

28:14.735 --> 28:15.735
No reason.

29:03.867 --> 29:04.867
Woof.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.452
Woof is right.

29:09.623 --> 29:10.623
Come here.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.786
Tonight kinda got away from us, huh?

29:18.465 --> 29:19.465
Yes, it did.

29:26.056 --> 29:29.515
Hey, I know I haven't
been that easy to talk to.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.723
I'm working on it, okay?

29:32.729 --> 29:34.641
It's been hard for me too, you know.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.316
I'm just trying to find a way
for us to get through this.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.781
I'm trying to too, I really, truly am.

29:45.784 --> 29:49.903
I just feel stuck, I feel like I can't,

29:51.123 --> 29:53.661
like it's not possible sometimes.

29:53.667 --> 29:54.828
Sarah.

29:54.835 --> 29:59.205
But I know that it
is and I want this to work.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.455
Sarah, where's her car?

30:03.176 --> 30:04.587
What?

30:04.594 --> 30:07.211
Her broken down car,
it was on the street.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.222
Where is it?

30:09.725 --> 30:12.593
I don't know, maybe it
got towed or something.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.468
No, I didn't see a tow truck show up.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.015
Did you hear what I just said?

30:16.023 --> 30:17.023
Let's go inside.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.282
Where is she?

30:27.159 --> 30:29.867
She's in the studio, why?

30:29.870 --> 30:31.486
Her car is gone.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.828
What?

30:32.831 --> 30:35.790
Her car that's supposed
to be broken down is gone.

30:35.792 --> 30:36.709
I knew it.

30:36.710 --> 30:39.293
She called for help, maybe it came.

30:39.296 --> 30:40.878
Are you for real?

30:40.881 --> 30:43.715
No, I kinda, I think Joe's right.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.709
I was just talking to her
about the art in the house

30:45.719 --> 30:49.008
and I mean, it was like
she'd never been here before.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.630
Why didn't you say anything?

30:50.640 --> 30:51.474
Oh wait, I remember,

30:51.475 --> 30:52.636
it's 'cause you never
use your fuckin' head.

30:52.642 --> 30:53.758
Hey, don't fucking yell at me.

30:53.769 --> 30:54.805
I didn't think it was a big deal.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.019
You didn't think it was a big deal?

30:57.022 --> 30:58.513
All right, you guys
can live in your little

30:58.523 --> 31:01.391
fantasy land all you want
where everybody holds hands

31:01.401 --> 31:04.985
and helps each other but that's
not the world we live in.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.775
Bad things happen.

31:06.782 --> 31:09.024
Jesus, what is your problem?

31:09.034 --> 31:11.572
Oh, my problem is whose stupid idea

31:11.578 --> 31:13.615
was it to even open the
fucking door to begin with?

31:13.622 --> 31:15.955
Hey, back the fuck off, man, all right?

31:15.957 --> 31:17.949
Oh yeah, or fucking what?

31:23.507 --> 31:24.793
What's going on?

31:27.803 --> 31:29.544
Let there be light.

31:30.472 --> 31:33.135
It's nothing divine,
it's just a power outage.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.302
We have them all the time up here.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.221
That's why we have backup generators.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.389
Where's your car?

31:37.396 --> 31:38.396
My car?

31:39.147 --> 31:40.228
It's outside.

31:41.191 --> 31:42.191
Is something wrong?

31:43.777 --> 31:44.858
All right.

31:44.861 --> 31:46.477
I'm sick of this, lady, I don't know

31:46.488 --> 31:47.321
what scam you're running but you need

31:47.322 --> 31:50.156
to get the fuck out of
this house right now.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.620
Hello?

31:57.249 --> 31:58.249
Anyone there?

32:00.210 --> 32:02.042
It must be nice having such a big,

32:02.045 --> 32:04.879
strong man to protect
you here at night, huh?

32:07.008 --> 32:09.250
Maybe you're not hearing me.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.253
Get out or I'm gonna drag you out

32:11.263 --> 32:13.676
by your little fucking skinny ankles.

32:13.682 --> 32:14.682
Do you understand?

32:17.602 --> 32:18.809
Oh, it's fine.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.896
Obviously I have outstayed my welcome.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.642
But I am not the Wicked
Witch of the West, honey.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.941
I'm a neighbor, you don't have to be rude.

32:29.865 --> 32:34.030
I'll just go grab a glass of
water and I'll be on my way.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.035
Jesus Christ.

32:39.249 --> 32:40.249
Call the police.

32:51.595 --> 32:54.463
911, what's...

32:54.473 --> 32:55.680
Are you deaf?

32:57.309 --> 32:58.142
What the fuck?

32:58.143 --> 33:00.009
What part of get out of our
house do you not understand?

33:00.020 --> 33:00.978
Get the fuck off me...

33:00.979 --> 33:02.641
Get the fuck out of our house!

33:02.647 --> 33:04.229
What the hell's wrong with you, man?

33:04.232 --> 33:05.268
What the fuck's wrong with me?

33:05.275 --> 33:06.108
What the fuck's wrong with you?

33:06.109 --> 33:07.520
Baby, I got it.
- Calm down.

33:07.527 --> 33:08.813
Hey!

33:08.820 --> 33:09.820
You need to get, what are you doing?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.357
Get the fuck out of our house!

33:22.167 --> 33:23.167
Oh shit.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.379
Oh shit.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.194
What happened?

33:56.409 --> 33:57.775
She attacked me.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.746
I mean, you saw that, right?

34:09.880 --> 34:10.880
Did she?

34:18.889 --> 34:20.426
No.

34:20.433 --> 34:21.433
I didn't...

34:22.686 --> 34:24.678
You see, it was the gun.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.146
See, she had a gun.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.853
She had a gun, it was self defense.

34:39.034 --> 34:40.742
You killed her.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.327
You killed her.

34:42.330 --> 34:45.447
Oh no, no, don't fuckin' say that.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.166
Take it easy, take it easy.

34:48.168 --> 34:51.003
I didn't do anything wrong,
babe, I didn't do anything.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.873
You're right, Victor, you're right.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.636
Why don't you give me the gun?

35:02.976 --> 35:03.892
Whoa.

35:03.893 --> 35:04.974
Just calm down, okay?

35:04.978 --> 35:07.138
Why don't you shut the fuck
up and let me think, hmm?

35:08.315 --> 35:09.315
Okay.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.067
Okay.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.730
Go sit down, everybody.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.148
- Victor.
- Go sit down!

35:15.155 --> 35:17.738
We're going, come on.

35:18.992 --> 35:19.992
What, is something the matter?

35:19.993 --> 35:20.826
No.

35:20.827 --> 35:21.660
- Huh?
- No.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.118
Why are you looking at me like that?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.038
Why are you looking at me like that?

35:24.039 --> 35:25.496
I'm not, I'm sorry.

35:25.498 --> 35:26.534
Why are you
looking at me like that?

35:26.541 --> 35:27.374
- I am not.
- Why?

35:27.375 --> 35:28.375
You think I did this?
- No, I didn't say...

35:28.376 --> 35:29.742
- You think I did this?
- I didn't say that.

35:29.753 --> 35:33.497
I didn't fucking do
this, I didn't do this.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.510
Shut the fuck up.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.225
Stop fucking crying!

35:52.984 --> 35:54.566
Let me think, all right?

35:54.569 --> 35:56.151
Not a fuckin' word.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.608
Are you okay?

36:02.619 --> 36:04.781
You're okay, it's okay.

36:04.788 --> 36:05.788
It's okay.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.546
Just leave her, she's fine.

36:23.556 --> 36:24.556
She's fucking fine.

36:39.239 --> 36:40.239
It's gonna be okay.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.402
We're gonna be okay, all right?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.239
We're gonna be fine.

36:46.246 --> 36:49.830
We just need to think for a little while.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.958
We just need to think.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.925
Okay.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.268
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.854
We're gonna clean this up and we're gonna

37:13.857 --> 37:17.316
get rid of the body and then
we're all gonna leave, okay?

37:18.528 --> 37:20.440
That doesn't make any sense.

37:20.447 --> 37:21.858
Yeah?

37:21.865 --> 37:23.902
You know what doesn't make any sense?

37:23.908 --> 37:25.900
Opening a fucking door
to a fucking stranger.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.744
Okay, I agree, I agree, all right?

37:28.747 --> 37:30.534
That was self defense.

37:30.540 --> 37:31.997
We don't have to hide the body, all right?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.707
We can just tell the truth.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.793
We can just tell the cops what happened.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.331
Nope.

37:37.338 --> 37:38.338
No.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.460
No.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.504
No, we're not gonna tell anyone anything.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.511
I'm cleaning up your mess because

37:46.514 --> 37:49.348
you couldn't keep your
fucking door closed.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.886
Get the fuck off her.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.644
- Or fucking what?
- Okay.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.479
Okay, just let her go.

37:58.318 --> 37:59.151
Just let her go.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.893
Sit down.

38:00.904 --> 38:01.904
All right.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.073
Okay.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.197
Please, what do you wanna do?

38:13.166 --> 38:16.955
We're gonna clean this up together.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.452
You

38:18.463 --> 38:19.463
and me.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.261
I'm sorry, Estelle.

38:33.436 --> 38:37.350
We're gonna clean this
up together, you and me.

38:38.775 --> 38:39.811
Go.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.686
- Let's go.
- Get out.

38:42.695 --> 38:43.612
Let's go.

38:43.613 --> 38:44.613
Okay.

39:30.076 --> 39:34.241
Now we're in this together,
brother, you and me.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.675
Okay, hey, come on, let's go.

39:49.929 --> 39:52.091
Hey.
- I can't.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.010
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

39:54.017 --> 39:54.850
Why?

39:54.851 --> 39:57.309
No, come on, let's go.

39:57.312 --> 40:00.100
I hate him so fucking much.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.523
I thought coming here would make it better

40:06.529 --> 40:11.115
but when he gets like that,
I don't know what to do.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.904
We're gonna leave.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.324
We're gonna leave, you're
gonna get away from him.

40:15.330 --> 40:16.288
No.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.370
- Yes.
- No.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.160
He'll fucking kill me.

40:20.627 --> 40:22.118
I won't let that happen.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.720
I'm sorry.

40:44.901 --> 40:48.065
♪ I won't live without it ♪

40:48.071 --> 40:53.066
♪ It's the only one you get ♪

40:53.284 --> 40:56.368

41:11.177 --> 41:15.262

41:52.051 --> 41:55.260
I need Victor out of my life.

41:55.263 --> 41:56.925
Yeah, well that makes two of us, okay?

41:56.931 --> 41:58.047
You don't understand.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.974
He's a fucking monster.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.809
I can't do it anymore.

42:05.815 --> 42:07.602
Look at me.

42:07.608 --> 42:10.100
The only thing we need
to worry about right now

42:10.111 --> 42:12.319
is getting the hell out
of this house, okay?

42:14.991 --> 42:18.155
You're stronger than
he is, you can stop him.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.283
Are you out of your mind?

42:23.166 --> 42:25.783
- Please help me, please.
- Look.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.409
I'm not in the mood to get shot tonight

42:27.420 --> 42:29.958
because you can't break up
with some abusive asshole.

42:29.964 --> 42:32.923
What do you think is gonna
happen when Victor finds out?

42:34.969 --> 42:39.259
You're just as fucked up
as he is, you know that?

42:39.265 --> 42:41.882
You two belong together.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.600
At least he's not a coward like you.

42:43.603 --> 42:45.845
What's going on?

42:48.024 --> 42:49.481
I'm gonna go check on Sarah,

42:49.484 --> 42:52.602
take a shower, then we're
getting out of here.

44:08.980 --> 44:09.980
Whenever I'm

44:11.065 --> 44:13.728
around you, whenever I see you,

44:16.195 --> 44:17.606
I think about it.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.948
I can't think about it anymore.

44:22.660 --> 44:23.867
What do you want?

44:32.712 --> 44:33.712
To escape.

44:37.967 --> 44:39.458
I think I,

44:39.468 --> 44:41.460
I think I have to do it alone.

44:43.097 --> 44:44.097
I'm sorry.

44:47.476 --> 44:48.476
I'm sorry.

44:51.898 --> 44:54.140
If I was you, I wouldn't
want to be with me either.

44:54.150 --> 44:57.518
No, no it's not, it's okay.

44:58.738 --> 45:00.149
I slept with someone else.

45:04.368 --> 45:05.484
It was with Estelle.

45:11.792 --> 45:12.792
I fucked up.

45:13.836 --> 45:14.917
I'm a piece of shit.

45:16.714 --> 45:20.003
I felt like what happened with
us and the baby was my fault.

45:20.009 --> 45:23.502
I felt like it was me
getting punished somehow.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.759
You getting punished, yeah.

45:27.975 --> 45:30.467
That's probably what happened.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.326
How many fucking times?

45:55.336 --> 45:57.202
I told you, it was just that once.

45:57.213 --> 45:58.213
Please, calm down.

46:01.050 --> 46:04.009
Go ahead, go ahead, tell
Sarah what you just told me.

46:04.011 --> 46:05.218
Go on, tell her.

46:05.221 --> 46:08.180
I already fucking know,
I don't give a fuck.

46:08.182 --> 46:09.298
What the hell's going on here?

46:09.308 --> 46:11.470
Oh, hey stud, welcome to the party.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.352
We were just talking about how

46:12.353 --> 46:15.517
you put your fucking
dick in my fucking girl.

46:15.523 --> 46:17.606
Listen, the best thing we can all do

46:17.608 --> 46:18.894
right now is just get the
hell outta here, all right?

46:18.901 --> 46:20.608
Shut the fuck up.

46:23.197 --> 46:25.814
After everything I did for you, babe,

46:25.825 --> 46:29.535
what, you were just gonna
fucking leave me here, huh?

46:29.537 --> 46:31.403
Is that what you were gonna do?

46:31.414 --> 46:32.247
Victor.

46:32.248 --> 46:34.285
I told you to shut the fuck up!

46:36.043 --> 46:37.284
Sarah.

46:37.295 --> 46:38.456
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46:38.462 --> 46:39.703
Don't fucking talk to her.

46:39.714 --> 46:42.707
Hey, okay, okay, let's
just get out of here.

46:42.717 --> 46:44.379
I will fucking end you, bitch.

46:44.385 --> 46:45.466
No one has to talk to
each other ever again.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.051
She's right,
that was the plan, right?

46:47.054 --> 46:51.139
Oh, I know your plan,
asshole, I know your plan.

46:51.142 --> 46:53.259
You set me up and you feed
me to the fucking dogs

46:53.269 --> 46:55.226
so you and this bitch can
live happily ever after.

46:55.229 --> 46:56.720
You gonna kill us all, then what?

46:56.731 --> 46:58.017
Then what, what is there to do...

46:58.024 --> 46:59.515
Don't fucking tell me what to do

46:59.525 --> 47:02.108
or I will fucking kill
you right now, okay?

47:02.111 --> 47:03.028
You can walk away right now, man.

47:03.029 --> 47:05.021
There's nothing, you didn't
do anything yet, okay?

47:05.031 --> 47:06.613
You didn't do anything.
- Oh fuck.

47:06.615 --> 47:08.652
If you kill us, that's not good, man.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.867
You're going to jail forever.
- I'm sorry.

47:10.870 --> 47:13.578
I'm sorry, baby I love you, I'm sorry.

47:13.581 --> 47:14.697
You love me?

47:14.707 --> 47:16.039
Really?
- I'm sorry.

47:16.042 --> 47:16.875
You love me or are you just a little

47:16.876 --> 47:19.243
whore with a heart of
gold, aren't you, huh?

47:19.253 --> 47:21.210
Don't fucking touch me.

47:21.213 --> 47:24.047
I'm fucking done with you.

47:24.050 --> 47:28.920
Don't fucking touch me ever
again, I fucking hate you.

47:28.929 --> 47:31.797
I'm fucking done with you,
now don't come near me.

47:31.807 --> 47:33.343
- Or fucking what?
- Fucking don't!

48:13.307 --> 48:15.014
Police, open up.

48:20.064 --> 48:21.305
Fuck.

48:25.486 --> 48:26.444
What do we do?

48:26.445 --> 48:28.277
Get the door, get rid of them, now.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.650
Okay, okay.

48:33.661 --> 48:34.661
Okay.

48:44.255 --> 48:45.255
Okay.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.298
We got a call
about a home invasion.

48:52.304 --> 48:54.762
Yeah, sorry, you scared us for a second.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.384
- Did you make the call?
- Mm hmm.

49:16.996 --> 49:18.737
- You all right?
- Yeah, sorry.

49:18.747 --> 49:20.158
Just a little freaked out.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.245
- How about you, you okay?
- Yeah.

49:23.252 --> 49:26.370
Yeah, thank you, thank you, thanks.

49:26.380 --> 49:27.712
You are?

49:27.715 --> 49:28.715
I'm Estelle.

49:29.884 --> 49:32.251
Estelle, and your friend?

49:32.261 --> 49:33.261
Sarah.

49:44.231 --> 49:45.023
So you said there was

49:45.024 --> 49:46.765
someone inside who refused to leave?

49:46.775 --> 49:49.643
Yeah, but she's gone now, so.

49:51.197 --> 49:52.608
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

49:55.910 --> 49:57.151
What's with the lights?

49:58.037 --> 50:00.404
Power outage, it's
happened twice tonight.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.241
Sarah, Estelle, why don't you

50:04.251 --> 50:06.459
take a seat and tell us what happened?

50:53.509 --> 50:55.842
You're gonna have to
forgive us for the delay.

50:58.889 --> 50:59.722
It's a small town, you know?

50:59.723 --> 51:00.964
We came as quick as we could.

51:04.979 --> 51:07.722
Why don't you two walk
us through what happened?

51:07.731 --> 51:09.017
Yeah, so,

51:09.858 --> 51:11.474
earlier tonight,

51:11.485 --> 51:13.147
someone

51:13.153 --> 51:13.987
came...

51:13.988 --> 51:16.150
It was a break-in.

51:16.156 --> 51:17.156
A break-in?

51:18.117 --> 51:19.403
Well,

51:19.410 --> 51:20.410
how did he get in?

51:22.329 --> 51:23.536
It's she.

51:23.539 --> 51:25.030
She?

51:25.040 --> 51:26.702
It was a woman.

51:26.709 --> 51:29.702
We let her in by mistake.

51:29.712 --> 51:30.712
Let her in?

51:31.547 --> 51:32.547
I

51:33.465 --> 51:36.082
let her in, she had her car broken down

51:36.093 --> 51:38.506
and she asked if she could use the phone.

51:39.888 --> 51:41.925
So you let her walk in
through the front door?

51:44.435 --> 51:45.435
Yeah.

51:51.692 --> 51:53.228
And then what?

51:53.235 --> 51:54.601
And then she attacked us.

51:57.698 --> 51:59.439
Yeah.

51:59.450 --> 52:00.283
Let's take it back a step.

52:00.284 --> 52:02.116
When the emergency call was made,

52:03.829 --> 52:05.445
the attacker was still in the house?

52:05.456 --> 52:06.867
I made the call.

52:06.874 --> 52:08.581
When was the question.

52:11.837 --> 52:14.204
- My boyfriend came in...
- Your boyfriend?

52:14.214 --> 52:16.422
And he surprised her

52:16.425 --> 52:18.166
and they started fighting.

52:20.721 --> 52:23.680
Him and this woman?

52:23.682 --> 52:25.048
Yeah, and then I got away.

52:27.311 --> 52:28.311
Was she a

52:29.730 --> 52:30.730
big woman?

52:31.732 --> 52:32.939
- Average.
- Yeah, average.

52:35.736 --> 52:37.819
Where is this boyfriend now?

52:37.821 --> 52:39.187
He's in the other room.

52:45.037 --> 52:46.653
Could you go and get him out?

52:46.664 --> 52:47.664
Yeah.

52:53.796 --> 52:56.630
Joseph, could you come out here, please?

52:56.632 --> 52:58.544
Officer...
- Sergeant Daniels.

52:58.550 --> 53:01.213
- Sergeant Daniels and...
- Officer Ramirez.

53:01.220 --> 53:04.429
Officer Ramirez, they have
questions about tonight.

53:09.019 --> 53:10.510
So should I just go get him?

53:12.815 --> 53:14.147
Well, hello there, sir.

53:14.149 --> 53:15.149
How you doing?

53:20.948 --> 53:22.109
How you doing?

53:24.076 --> 53:25.612
Here he is.

53:25.619 --> 53:26.619
The hero.

53:27.371 --> 53:30.455
Yeah, this is Joseph, my boyfriend.

53:33.419 --> 53:36.912
So Miss Estelle tells us that you had

53:36.922 --> 53:38.754
an altercation of sorts and you

53:38.757 --> 53:41.875
were able to chase off your visitor.

53:43.595 --> 53:45.302
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

53:45.305 --> 53:46.591
Yeah, he scared her off.

53:47.933 --> 53:49.469
I'd like to hear it from him.

53:52.104 --> 53:53.515
Well,

53:53.522 --> 53:54.603
like Estelle said,

53:56.066 --> 53:57.066
I came out

53:57.860 --> 54:01.399
and I saw what was happening
and I charged her, you know?

54:02.281 --> 54:03.488
I didn't really know what else to do,

54:03.490 --> 54:06.983
so I thought that would
be the right thing to do.

54:09.163 --> 54:10.574
And then we threw some punches...

54:10.581 --> 54:12.117
Punches?

54:12.124 --> 54:15.367
Well, I mean not
punches like boxing but,

54:15.377 --> 54:16.743
you know, we just wrestled.
- Yeah.

54:16.754 --> 54:20.043
And then I made the call
and then she ran off.

54:23.594 --> 54:24.594
Yeah.

54:25.721 --> 54:27.428
The three of you live here?

54:27.431 --> 54:28.389
We're visiting.

54:28.390 --> 54:30.723
We rented for the weekend.

54:31.935 --> 54:33.301
A rental, huh, no kidding?

54:34.813 --> 54:35.813
It's nice.

54:36.857 --> 54:37.857
Thanks.

54:38.692 --> 54:40.354
Where y'all from?

54:40.360 --> 54:41.851
- New York.
- Upstate.

54:41.862 --> 54:44.104
Well we have a, it's a,

54:46.408 --> 54:49.446
we have a long distance relationship.

54:57.336 --> 55:00.579
Well where does that leave you?

55:00.589 --> 55:01.589
Oh Sarge,

55:03.509 --> 55:06.627
you guys are here on a romantic
getaway type of thing, huh?

55:08.305 --> 55:09.591
Yes, modern times, buddy.

55:11.350 --> 55:12.350
Exactly.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.560
Yeah.

55:15.938 --> 55:18.897
Just the three of you then, no one else?

55:18.899 --> 55:21.141
Just us, yeah, just us three.

55:28.116 --> 55:29.116
I'm gonna have a word with my partner,

55:29.117 --> 55:30.904
will you excuse me for a sec?

55:39.044 --> 55:40.751
Are you buying any of this?

55:40.754 --> 55:41.790
Are you kidding me?

55:42.756 --> 55:45.089
What is the deal with these people?

55:47.427 --> 55:49.339
I think they're pretty fuckin' high.

55:51.431 --> 55:53.138
- You think?
- That's just my guess,

55:53.141 --> 55:54.141
as a cop.

55:56.019 --> 55:57.510
So how do you wanna play this?

56:01.275 --> 56:05.235
So, where did she go when
she ran away, your attacker?

56:06.989 --> 56:10.153
There was an old car on
the street that she got into.

56:10.158 --> 56:11.865
Did you get a good look at the vehicle?

56:13.245 --> 56:15.157
I'm not really a car guy but

56:16.081 --> 56:18.664
it was an Oldsmobile maybe, brown I think.

56:18.667 --> 56:20.875
- Yeah, yep.
- I'm not 100% sure now.

56:23.005 --> 56:24.166
A brown Oldsmobile?

56:25.173 --> 56:26.173
Yeah.

56:27.009 --> 56:28.216
Yeah, I think so.

56:31.096 --> 56:33.804
Like the one sitting outside right now?

56:33.807 --> 56:34.807
What?

56:39.980 --> 56:40.980
That's not yours?

56:42.024 --> 56:43.265
No.

56:43.275 --> 56:44.275
No.

56:46.028 --> 56:48.862
So nobody is aware of the vehicle

56:48.864 --> 56:51.322
that's parked out in front
of this property right now?

56:52.701 --> 56:54.567
Go and run the plates, could you?

56:57.247 --> 56:58.247
Yeah.

57:04.463 --> 57:05.544
Stop, stop!

58:40.475 --> 58:43.092
Put the fucking weapon down.

58:44.521 --> 58:47.389
Put the fucking weapon down, now.

58:49.651 --> 58:50.983
Put the fucking gun down.

58:51.945 --> 58:53.607
Put the gun down, it's okay.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.200
Step away.

58:59.745 --> 59:01.202
You, do not move.

59:09.671 --> 59:10.671
All right.

59:13.675 --> 59:14.882
You two, step over here.

59:33.111 --> 59:35.353
I'm gonna secure the
perimeter of this house.

59:36.573 --> 59:38.189
You three will stay put.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.862
Can you do that for me, Sarah?

59:41.536 --> 59:42.947
Estelle?

59:42.954 --> 59:44.070
Yeah.

59:44.081 --> 59:45.081
Yes sir.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:08.437
Jesus.

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:19.363
Shut the fuck up bitch, now!

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.653
Oh my god!

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.660
Fuck!

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.946
Get the hell out!

01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:36.841
Estelle.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.400
Stop, what the fuck, man?

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:05.411
Stop, stop.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.556
Shh, shh.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.831
Sarah?

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:27.011
Estelle?

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:57.369
- Is it stuck?
- Yeah.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:04:00.083
What are we gonna do?

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:04.793
We gotta go out the side door, come on.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:08.093
Stay low.

01:05:57.704 --> 01:05:58.990
Sarah!

01:05:58.997 --> 01:05:59.997
Come on.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.635
Estelle.

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:03.600
Get over here.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:14.937
No, no, no!

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:36.584
Wider.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:41.431
Wider.

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.315
All right, get her up.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.735
Oh fuck.

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.869
I think we got off on the wrong

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:13.495
foot earlier, wouldn't you agree?

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:17.875
Why are you hurting us?

01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:19.341
Why?

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.837
The wrong place at the wrong time.

01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:30.805
We pillage and plunder,

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:33.228
rip the flesh off our
brothers and sisters.

01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:37.316
There's no moral order, just this.

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.564
Can my violence conquer yours?

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:44.277
I just want to go home.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:51.955
Go and look for the
photograph, would you please?

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.872
I'll handle this, thank you.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:05.131
Those guys can be fucking
animals, you know?

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.929
The owners of this house
took a photo and those

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:11.019
two monsters killed them
before they gave it to us.

01:09:11.022 --> 01:09:13.560
Now, I have a less dramatic approach.

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:17.524
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.158
One of you

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.777
is gonna be more
cooperative than the other.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:32.499
Are we on the same page?

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:49.636
Boom, Estelle.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:52.979
It's you.

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:56.856
May I?

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.030
Listen to me.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:06.363
Where are the pictures?

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:09.538
I...

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:13.036
What are you talking about?

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.783
There are so many
pictures in this house.

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:15.910
We don't know what you mean.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.003
You'll have to think
a little fucking harder

01:10:18.005 --> 01:10:21.214
because you must have seen something

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.004
or you wouldn't have lied to me

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:24.876
about my dead friend in the bathtub!

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:27.888
We don't know anything.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.393
Naughty, naughty Estelle.

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:38.728
There's something about you I
just can't put my finger on.

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:43.520
Do you want to know what it is?

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:44.988
Would you like an example?

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:55.074
Why did I find this man in your bedroom

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.542
with a large poultry knife in his gut?

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:00.462
Look at you.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:03.503
You look quite fond of him and yet,

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.168
your lover boy

01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:09.174
came to an unfortunate end

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:12.511
in a brave attempt

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:13.679
to save your life

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:16.095
tonight, right?

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:21.642
Sarah, forgive me.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:29.534
Forgive me?

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:35.114
Oh.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:40.624
I think we have a little friction here.

01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:43.334
Is that what we have?

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:45.924
So where does that leave you?

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:26.840
Please, just let us go.

01:12:28.803 --> 01:12:30.795
You know what I think?

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:33.056
I think

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:34.766
we've stumbled

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.346
onto a lover's quarrel.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:42.022
Has this young lady done
something to hurt you?

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:44.895
Hmm?

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:45.902
Well,

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:51.322
we can't let her get away with that.

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:54.367
We've got to do something.

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:05.712
Go on, tell her how you feel.

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:10.635
Get up.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.678
No, no, not that way, crawl.

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:19.102
Crawl.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:21.563
Crawl.

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:24.149
That's it.

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:26.151
That's it.

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:28.192
That's it, now,

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:32.235
you show her how you feel.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.410
Hit her.

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:37.782
Hit

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:38.788
her.

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:41.406
It's okay, it's okay, just do it.

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:44.493
Just do it.

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.006
Make it count.

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:50.467
Hit her.

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.141
There it is.

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:01.889
Beautiful, Sarah.

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:03.813
Again.

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:08.066
It's okay, it's okay, do it.

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:14.280
Again.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.283
Again!

01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:19.663
And again!

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:29.493
That's it.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:36.462
Now, do either of you have
anything you want to tell me

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:38.464
or have you not learned your lesson yet?

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:46.940
All right, fuck it.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:30.859
Hey, Sarah.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:32.610
You ever seen this before?

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.398
It's wild.

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:35.405
Ah, si, si.

01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:38.365
- One.
- No, no, no, no, please.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:39.653
- Two.
- No.

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.247
Oh my god, that's intense.

01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:53.414
Estelle, how do you feel?

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.878
Are you learning your lesson, ladies?

01:15:58.888 --> 01:15:59.924
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:03.181
No, no.

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:05.096
No please, don't, please no.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:06.434
One.

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:08.349
No, no, no, no, please don't.

01:16:08.355 --> 01:16:09.721
No, no, no.
- Two.

01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:11.441
No.

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:17.191
Last chance, ladies.

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:18.564
You know, I only need one of you

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:19.655
to tell me what I need to know.

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:22.571
So if either of you have anything to say,

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:25.821
now would be the time to figure it out.

01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:40.544
I know where it is.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:43.138
How do I know you're telling the truth?

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.140
I can show you.

01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:46.684
You can show me?

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:48.645
All right.

01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:55.521
Isn't this an interesting
turn of events, huh?

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:58.020
Estelle, I guess we won't
be needing you anymore.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.947
What?

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:00.564
No, no, no, no.

01:17:00.574 --> 01:17:01.491
Don't hurt her.

01:17:01.492 --> 01:17:02.983
I'm gonna show you!

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:04.279
Please, don't.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:07.825
- I'm gonna show you.
- No, no, please don't.

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:09.073
Please don't.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:18:00.540
We trashed this
place already, now where?

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:08.594
It's in the enlarger.

01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:17.273
I'll show you.

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:18.276
Okay, show me.

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:46.346
What are you doing?

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:47.588
Don't you wanna see it?

01:19:12.957 --> 01:19:13.957
That's it.

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:24.670
What the fuck?

01:19:30.975 --> 01:19:32.341
Sarah!

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.092
Sarah, where are you?
