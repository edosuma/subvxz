00:49.840 --> 00:53.680
The girls are here! Whoa!

00:55.960 --> 00:57.000
A lot of girls.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.920
Alright. Alright.

01:01.120 --> 01:01.960
Whoa!

01:03.200 --> 01:04.280
How can you choose?

01:04.360 --> 01:05.400
Hello, bosses.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.560
Hello. How are you?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.400
I'm Qingqing, from Heilongjiang.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.120
- Heilongjiang.
- I'm from Henan.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.000
- I'm Lingling, from Guizhou.
- I'm Xixi, from Mongolia.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.640
Hi, handsome bosses,
I'm Sau Ming from Guangxi.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.560
This one's good. I can talk to her.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.680
- Hello, I'm Jiajia from Hunan.
- I'm Waiwai from Beijing.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.440
Where are you from?
You've stayed in Zhuhai for a long time?

01:34.520 --> 01:35.520
I'm sorry.

01:36.320 --> 01:40.400
You forgot? I'm from Guangxi.
I speak Cantonese!

01:40.480 --> 01:42.920
Yes…Guangxi.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.800
- And you? From Macau?
- No. From Hong Kong.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.480
Hong Kong?
Where in Hong Kong?

01:51.200 --> 01:54.880
- You won't know even if I told you.
- Come on. Tell me.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.840
Sure, I can tell you.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.280
If you marry me, I'll tell you.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.880
Marry you?

02:03.000 --> 02:07.400
I don't even know your name.
How can I marry you?

02:07.480 --> 02:09.039
Call me Mr. Four Eyes.

02:09.560 --> 02:15.280
No. Just call you charming Four Eyes.
Now can you tell me where you live?

02:18.360 --> 02:21.680
Okay. I live at Lantau Island.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.920
Lantau Island?

02:24.840 --> 02:27.280
That's right.
You don't know it?

02:27.360 --> 02:29.800
Lantau Island is famous for many things.

02:29.880 --> 02:33.320
- Like?
- Lu Ting are the most famous.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.560
- Is that edible?
- No!

02:36.640 --> 02:39.080
I'm their descendent. Listen!

02:42.160 --> 02:46.280
Legend has it…sirens lived far out at sea…

02:46.360 --> 02:49.840
With enchanting eyes and seductive smiles.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.800
When seafarers chanced upon
such fair maidens…

02:52.880 --> 02:57.320
Thrust one's mighty phallus
to tame their lustful ways!

02:57.400 --> 03:00.280
- And break their evil spells!
- Is that really true?

03:00.360 --> 03:03.400
Mr. Smart-Ass! A round of applause!

03:03.480 --> 03:08.120
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Finished? Let's continue…Focus!

03:08.200 --> 03:10.480
I didn't make it up!

03:11.560 --> 03:13.080
I didn't make it up!

03:13.200 --> 03:15.560
Fine, I'll get changed
and we can go out?

03:16.320 --> 03:17.680
Great! Great!

03:18.440 --> 03:19.760
Hurry up.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.240
Get up! Get up!
The police are here!

03:25.520 --> 03:27.080
Don't move! Don't move!

03:27.240 --> 03:28.560
Isn't this a secret place?

03:28.680 --> 03:29.960
Show your identity card!

03:30.040 --> 03:31.160
Don't move!

03:32.920 --> 03:35.200
ID card!
Show me!

03:35.280 --> 03:36.680
Show me!

03:37.640 --> 03:39.640
Are you two in China for business?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.400
We're tourists from Hong Kong.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.600
Yes, we're here for the karaoke.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.240
Take those with China IDs outside first!

03:46.320 --> 03:47.920
Out! Move!

03:48.040 --> 03:49.640
Get up! Show me your ID!

03:49.720 --> 03:50.880
Leaving so soon!

03:50.960 --> 03:52.520
I didn't even get to touch her!

03:53.280 --> 03:54.400
What's his name?

03:55.680 --> 03:57.160
Lu Ting.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.480
And her?
What's her name?

04:01.480 --> 04:02.680
Sau Ming.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.960
You both are lying obviously.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.640
All the way from Hong Kong
to prostitute, Miss?

04:09.400 --> 04:10.440
You cunning fox.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.200
You were faking it!

04:12.280 --> 04:13.280
Take her out!

04:13.440 --> 04:15.080
No! We're really from Hong Kong…

04:15.160 --> 04:16.680
- Take her out!
- Help me!

04:16.800 --> 04:18.760
We're getting married!

04:18.839 --> 04:22.840
You're lucky to have been caught here,
it's better than between the sheets!

04:22.920 --> 04:24.760
I'm really only here to sing!

04:24.840 --> 04:26.560
An all-nighter deal isn't it?

04:28.160 --> 04:29.280
That's it for tonight.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.840
Step outside and pay a fine!

04:48.440 --> 04:50.400
<i>Hello? Fatty?</i>

04:50.480 --> 04:54.480
<i>Can you loan me $5,000? I'm in Zhuhai!</i>

04:55.520 --> 04:57.920
In trouble again?
You want the money now?

04:58.040 --> 05:00.600
<i>I can't leave without paying!</i>

05:00.680 --> 05:03.520
Where do I get $5,000
in the middle of the night?

05:10.280 --> 05:11.680
Sea - sea: big lake; a base of, ocean

05:11.760 --> 05:13.720
Close to the mainland,
waters smaller than the ocean

05:13.800 --> 05:16.480
Used for lake names - Large capacity
Large number of people - Aimlessly

05:47.560 --> 05:50.480
Big Brother,
when Mui gets off work,

05:50.560 --> 05:51.760
you both can meet.

05:51.840 --> 05:56.480
- Have dinner before you leave.
- No, I'm not staying for dinner.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.080
Because there's no sea patrol at night.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.480
How's business?

06:07.560 --> 06:10.040
Business will pick up
with the fishing moratorium.

06:10.120 --> 06:14.000
- Give me a bigger cut then!
- Greedy bastard!

06:14.080 --> 06:19.000
Second Brother,
I want to get a new laptop. Get an Apple.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.120
Not enough?

06:21.920 --> 06:23.160
- Here you go.
- Thank you!

06:23.240 --> 06:24.720
Thank you.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.560
Come back next month!

06:26.720 --> 06:27.800
Next month?

06:27.880 --> 06:30.360
That's right before the moratorium.
I'll be busy.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.280
- Maybe the month after.
- Take care!

06:38.080 --> 06:40.720
Give me those too!

06:47.720 --> 06:49.720
Greedy jackass brother!

07:37.920 --> 07:40.880
Why's there a long queue?
Many girls there?

07:40.960 --> 07:43.880
No need for many! This one's good enough.

07:44.640 --> 07:45.880
Second Brother!

07:46.000 --> 07:49.360
I've told you I want to
marry your daughter?

07:49.440 --> 07:51.600
Have you decided?

07:51.680 --> 07:54.600
You just want to get laid,
why bother marrying?

07:54.680 --> 07:57.400
- I love her!
- Love?

07:58.720 --> 08:01.720
Fine. Tell me how much money you want.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.800
You are so heartless, making her a whore.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.760
If she doesn't do this,
how do you get off?

08:16.240 --> 08:18.400
- I'm coming up.
- Move your ass.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.320
Mui.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.120
How are you?

08:38.559 --> 08:39.559
It's me again.

08:48.440 --> 08:52.800
Mui's very busy.
There's a long line outside.

08:53.560 --> 08:57.080
They want a quickie
before going home for dinner.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.800
The condom is on the table!
Use it!

08:59.880 --> 09:02.840
- I'm on it!
- Remember to use it!

10:40.360 --> 10:43.600
Stroke, 8, 9, 10!
More power!

10:48.400 --> 10:52.120
Another round? Pay up first!
You pay per shot.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.880
What if you can shoot 30 times?
How could we make money?

11:38.440 --> 11:42.120
<i>Lucky Scepter moves up fast</i>
<i>with Ultimate Glory on the outside!</i>

11:42.200 --> 11:43.720
<i>Moving forwards within the pack.</i>

11:43.800 --> 11:47.400
<i>Last 100 meters! Solar Kingdom on</i>
<i>the rails! Lucky Scepter in the middle!</i>

11:47.480 --> 11:49.160
<i>Ultimate Glory out wide…closing in!</i>

11:49.240 --> 11:50.800
<i>Lucky Scepter wins!</i>

11:52.120 --> 11:53.040
Hey!

11:53.160 --> 11:54.120
Take this…

11:56.920 --> 11:58.120
Move this too!

11:58.920 --> 12:02.000
- It's heavy!
- Let's move it together.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.280
Give me this.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.960
Lunch's here!

12:06.040 --> 12:09.480
Hong's asking us to go to
Shenzhen tonight for girls.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.440
So, want to go?

12:10.520 --> 12:11.480
Hey, Four Eyes!

12:11.600 --> 12:14.280
No freaking way!

12:14.360 --> 12:16.680
China whores cost too much!

12:16.760 --> 12:19.320
Why travel so far?

12:19.400 --> 12:21.400
Just go to that Tanka boat girl!

12:21.480 --> 12:22.880
Same as any mainland chick!

12:22.960 --> 12:25.360
One's an army operation,
one's a navy operation.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.880
Fuck! The sea chick is super hot!

12:28.960 --> 12:33.000
A goddess with snowy flesh,
and a voluptuous bosom too.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.840
We can't afford housing,
but at least we can buy boobs!

12:35.920 --> 12:37.840
- Don't you agree?
- For real?

12:38.360 --> 12:39.960
Why would I lie?

12:40.040 --> 12:41.480
One more thing.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.000
Doing it on the boat…that swaying motion.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.320
- It's like doing it in outer space.
- Awesome!

12:49.480 --> 12:53.480
Wow! People still buy
grave plot for burial?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.640
Yeah. They still do it?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.320
Burial items are costly too.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.400
<i>Including The Show…</i>
<i>Sure Win's going for it!</i>

13:04.480 --> 13:07.560
<i>Also Paddington and the rest!</i>
<i>Now they're entering the straight!</i>

13:07.640 --> 13:10.160
<i>Holding a steady lead is Dr. Proactive!</i>

13:10.240 --> 13:12.480
<i>Closing in strongly</i>
<i>is Starlet in the middle.</i>

13:12.560 --> 13:16.280
<i>The Show goes wide</i>
<i>while London Master is on the rails.</i>

13:16.360 --> 13:19.240
<i>Almost 100 meters out</i>
<i>and it's neck-and-neck.</i>

13:19.320 --> 13:22.320
<i>It's Dr. Proactive</i>
<i>with Applause storming up behind.</i>

13:22.400 --> 13:23.680
<i>Let's see who wins!</i>

13:23.760 --> 13:26.840
<i>Looks like The Show</i>
<i>going wide may place third!</i>

13:26.920 --> 13:28.520
<i>Let's see who'll be first.</i>

13:37.520 --> 13:38.560
Hey!

13:44.240 --> 13:45.280
Where's your father?

13:46.320 --> 13:47.400
He's not here?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.320
What's this?

15:17.760 --> 15:19.920
You never mentioned you have a kid…

15:29.560 --> 15:31.560
You're breast feeding. Behave yourself!

15:45.400 --> 15:47.480
It feels great with a baby.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.680
I want you to be my wife.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.680
You're not a whore.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.160
You're a fish.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.160
I won't screw around anymore.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.840
Let's make a baby together!

16:16.320 --> 16:17.760
<i>Sarah, who got off the horse?</i>

16:17.880 --> 16:20.560
<i>Now let's look at no.3,</i>
<i>London Master, who just mounted…</i>

16:20.640 --> 16:23.560
<i>Today's your first time</i>
<i>commentating at Happy Valley.</i>

16:23.640 --> 16:24.480
<i>Yes…</i>

16:24.560 --> 16:27.320
<i>What happened in Shatin?</i>
<i>How many thousand was that?</i>

16:27.400 --> 16:30.560
<i>-Millions on a four-race accumulator bet.</i>
<i>-And you predicted it?</i>

16:32.520 --> 16:34.560
This one's a conundrum!

16:35.400 --> 16:36.240
Mui.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.560
There's a silly guy who wants
to marry you.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.280
It's Four Eyes!

16:43.120 --> 16:44.280
I'm so happy!

16:44.360 --> 16:47.120
Happy? But I'll miss you.

16:50.080 --> 16:54.000
That dumbass,
I think he's poorer than us.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.240
Where will he get the money to marry you?

16:56.320 --> 16:58.120
<i>For #4, #5 and #8. A3 pays 2,8 times…</i>

16:58.280 --> 17:00.920
<i>A2 has the highest odds.</i>

17:06.720 --> 17:09.400
But you're different,
and handsome.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.160
It'd be a shame
if you didn't bless a girl.

17:13.240 --> 17:17.040
Didn't Four Eyes tell you?
He found a girl willing to marry him!

17:17.119 --> 17:19.240
Are you sure?

17:19.319 --> 17:22.000
Who would marry a shitface like him?

17:22.119 --> 17:26.119
- It's for real!
- He borrowed money from you again?

17:26.200 --> 17:29.480
- Of course he did.
- And you gave it to him?

17:32.320 --> 17:36.080
What's with the phone call?
We're here to eat!

17:36.880 --> 17:38.440
I'm really busy.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.840
Your grandma nagged me
for not getting married.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.280
Serves you right.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.520
Don't eat too much ginkgo!
You'll waste sperm with wet dreams.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.720
Didn't they teach you that in school?

17:52.440 --> 17:53.480
Teach?

17:54.840 --> 17:58.480
- I only ate one piece of gingko!
- You mustn't waste even a drop of sperm!

18:32.440 --> 18:36.320
I got a call from Mainland police.
It was about that Zhuhai incident.

18:37.320 --> 18:41.240
It turns out that Hong Kong girl
is still being detained.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.280
And she's not able to come back.

18:43.360 --> 18:47.400
What?
Didn't Fatty settle the payment for you?

18:47.480 --> 18:51.680
Yes, but the cops
still came looking for me.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.600
- Bad luck.
- Not quite.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.160
You're lucky with the girls.
Butter face Boy!

18:57.240 --> 19:00.000
Scored a Hong Kong whore in China.

19:00.160 --> 19:03.400
- What's so funny?
- But you're one unlucky dickhead.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.680
If the police didn't show up,
you still thought

19:06.760 --> 19:09.040
that you scored a hot slut.

19:17.560 --> 19:21.520
Here, have more sea snails.
They help keeping you wet.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.040
The fishing moratorium is near.
No more sea snails for you then.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.320
- Eat more!
- There's fish.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.080
Fish?
Fish doesn't get you wet.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.520
It'll hurt if it's too dry.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.480
Doesn't hurt…

19:37.680 --> 19:39.680
You won't suffer, but I will.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.720
Is this funny to you?

19:51.200 --> 19:56.440
What? Haven't you moaned enough already?
Finish up and we can start work.

19:59.920 --> 20:06.360
I think, that Four Eyes
was just being impulsive.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.440
I doubt he has the money to marry you.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.240
He's all skin and bones.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.320
He probably can't satisfy you at all.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.160
Even if you go to the city with him,

20:19.000 --> 20:20.760
you won't survive long.

20:20.840 --> 20:23.440
Transportation is expensive.

20:24.280 --> 20:28.880
There is rent and utility bills.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.840
Not like living on a boat,
completely free!

20:32.680 --> 20:34.240
No money…

20:35.040 --> 20:38.040
Yes! You can't live without money!

20:42.440 --> 20:47.040
We have a fantastic sea view.
No hustle and bustle.

20:47.120 --> 20:51.240
Rocking on the boat…
Swim wherever we want…

20:51.880 --> 20:53.520
Isn't this great?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.560
Riding back and forth…

20:59.920 --> 21:00.880
But then…

21:01.520 --> 21:03.560
Once you get married and live on land,

21:04.160 --> 21:07.440
life won't be so hard for you,
and for me.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.360
I guess that's better.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.560
OUTER HARBOR PASSENGER TERMINAL

22:14.080 --> 22:15.000
Hey, Four Eyes!

22:15.960 --> 22:17.560
The police are looking for you!

22:18.120 --> 22:19.040
Looking for me?

22:19.840 --> 22:24.440
If the cops ask where we ship our cargo,
say you don't know. Got it, Four Eyes?

22:24.520 --> 22:28.400
I really don't know where it goes.
Unless it's to North Korea or something.

22:28.520 --> 22:29.680
Stop talking!

22:36.280 --> 22:37.800
Let's work!

22:37.880 --> 22:44.440
No! Wait till the cops leave!
Get back in! Go inside.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.720
I'm at the cemetery during the day,
here at night.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.200
Two nights ago at the cemetery,
someone stole burial items from a tomb.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.560
I was in Zhuhai.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.760
- Zhuhai?
- Yes.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.760
To do what? Sell stolen goods.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.800
I went to Zhuhai to get laid.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.360
Any proof?

23:04.280 --> 23:06.280
What? Proof of hooking up with a chick?

23:07.320 --> 23:10.480
- How about my ferry ticket?
- Show me.

23:12.640 --> 23:17.560
A gambling addict!
A sore loser! Piece of shit!

23:18.360 --> 23:19.680
Loser.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.840
Chop off my hand! Stop me from gambling.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.920
Come on! Grab the cleaver!

23:28.120 --> 23:29.400
Hurry up!

23:30.040 --> 23:31.240
Chop it!

23:32.160 --> 23:34.240
Chop it off!

23:36.560 --> 23:38.160
Do it now!

23:41.400 --> 23:42.680
Take it!

24:28.760 --> 24:31.960
Hand…Useful…

24:33.120 --> 24:35.640
Down there…Useless as fuck…

25:25.360 --> 25:30.240
Go!

25:33.640 --> 25:36.400
Go!

25:37.040 --> 25:40.120
Go!

25:42.720 --> 25:45.520
Go!

25:45.600 --> 25:48.240
Go!

25:49.400 --> 25:52.160
Go!

26:04.640 --> 26:06.560
Hey, Brother!

26:07.560 --> 26:08.960
Tough luck!

26:09.040 --> 26:12.520
Mui is on her period.
Can't see anyone now.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.520
No, I'm not here for that!
Come here!

26:17.000 --> 26:20.520
There! Here's… $70,000!

26:20.600 --> 26:24.880
$10,000 more than you asked for!
The extra $10,000 is your bonus!

26:26.520 --> 26:29.400
- Wow! You got it!
- Of course!

26:29.480 --> 26:30.560
Look!

26:30.720 --> 26:36.000
You can marry Mui,
but she still has to live here.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.920
- And continue the business.
- Are you nuts?

26:39.000 --> 26:42.920
Mui will live with me
in the safest place on earth!

26:43.000 --> 26:45.400
She won't be a Tanka boat girl anymore!

26:46.000 --> 26:47.480
Go ashore?

26:48.480 --> 26:50.560
Why the hell not? So?

26:50.640 --> 26:53.240
- You have property?
- Yes!

27:04.160 --> 27:06.560
It's okay. No need.

27:07.680 --> 27:12.320
Wow! Can't believe
that fuckface married my goddess.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.520
That dude always asks
girls to marry him.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.480
The trick seems to really work!

27:19.560 --> 27:22.200
He loves her unconditionally
and doesn't mind her baby.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.640
I couldn't do it.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.680
Not really. His wife
does have a fantastic body.

27:28.760 --> 27:32.360
Clever boy! Sneaked out for a taste.
And didn't breathe a word!

27:32.440 --> 27:34.720
Sorry! But I've tasted her too!

27:35.280 --> 27:37.920
- For real?
- In one word, exceptional!

27:38.000 --> 27:39.680
Yes! I'd do her again!

27:39.760 --> 27:42.640
I was going to try her out next week.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.960
Too fucking late now!

27:45.600 --> 27:48.120
Hey! Stop with the bullshit.

27:48.200 --> 27:52.200
She's our sister-in-law now.
The wife of a friend.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.240
What's wrong with that?
We're just talking.

27:55.320 --> 27:58.760
- Freedom of speech!
- No way. Not one stray thought.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.080
Good! Look here!

28:00.160 --> 28:02.800
Ready… Smile!

28:06.640 --> 28:08.840
Land - land, continental, army
Land above water

28:08.920 --> 28:10.400
Following manner - Jump - Surname

28:31.440 --> 28:34.680
Aren't you done yet?
The food's getting cold!

29:01.200 --> 29:02.720
What's up?

29:04.160 --> 29:05.600
You're unhappy?

29:09.360 --> 29:12.480
It must be a little awkward to do it here.

29:31.560 --> 29:36.400
I don't get it. Doing it on land
or at sea is the same, ain't it?

29:37.240 --> 29:39.520
It's still doing it in a bed.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.520
Don't…Don't be upset.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.320
Alright?

29:58.440 --> 30:00.000
Sister.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.720
The neighbors complained
about a woman at your place.

32:43.800 --> 32:44.960
Kids are scared of her.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.880
What?

32:46.960 --> 32:48.520
Scared of what?

32:48.600 --> 32:49.680
Are you scared?

32:50.520 --> 32:51.760
Like this?

32:53.840 --> 32:56.240
Keep calm, Granny.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.400
What are you looking?

33:43.880 --> 33:45.000
Let's go.

33:45.720 --> 33:46.760
Let's go.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.480
Hey, Four Eyes! What's up?
Not enough sleep?

37:49.560 --> 37:50.720
You're fired.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.800
Don't just stand there.
Grab your stuff.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.400
Come and get your salary.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.680
- What?
- Come and get your salary.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.320
You useless piece of…

38:00.400 --> 38:01.880
Come over here!

38:01.960 --> 38:05.400
What fucking bitch mothered
a dickhead like you!

38:05.480 --> 38:09.680
Weak, shit-for-brains…
Better off giving birth to roast pork.

38:09.760 --> 38:13.960
Not sure who's the biggest idiot here.
To think I hired a shithead like you!

38:14.040 --> 38:17.280
Move it, will you!
Get the fuck over here! You moron!

38:19.280 --> 38:20.480
What are you doing?

38:21.360 --> 38:22.640
Stop it! You're insane?

38:22.720 --> 38:25.960
How old are you, Granny?
80 something?

38:26.040 --> 38:27.440
82.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.880
Wow! That's amazing.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.120
Amazing! 82!

41:00.440 --> 41:02.800
Mui?
Are you okay?

41:03.400 --> 41:04.600
Stand up.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.600
Good?

41:16.560 --> 41:18.040
What are you looking for?

41:18.160 --> 41:19.520
- A face mask.
- Yes.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.560
You'd like that?

42:13.320 --> 42:19.760
Is this much better? Swaying like a boat!

42:34.680 --> 42:36.200
Excuse me!

42:36.920 --> 42:39.160
Is this where Four Eyes lives?

42:41.920 --> 42:43.320
Excuse me!

42:44.120 --> 42:46.120
Is this where Four Eyes lives?

42:53.280 --> 42:54.760
Are you family?

42:56.680 --> 42:59.200
This address is correct.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.920
I want to know if Four Eyes is around?

43:07.320 --> 43:09.400
Brother Four Eyes lives here.

43:10.360 --> 43:12.600
- What?
- She can't talk.

43:12.680 --> 43:13.520
What's that?

43:13.600 --> 43:16.200
She's a little crazy.
Mom says she's crazy.

43:16.280 --> 43:17.680
She's crazy?

43:19.040 --> 43:21.720
You… Crazy!

43:33.200 --> 43:36.400
Hey, don't you live on the 9th floor?
What are you doing here?

43:36.480 --> 43:37.640
Nothing.

43:39.120 --> 43:43.200
Scram! You idiot!
There's nothing to see!

43:44.640 --> 43:46.000
See…See…

43:48.840 --> 43:50.480
Why are you sitting here?

43:55.440 --> 43:58.320
Open the door!
Mui! Open the door!

43:59.760 --> 44:05.600
- Woman!
- Mui. Open the door! Mui!

44:06.480 --> 44:10.040
- Woman!
- What?

44:10.560 --> 44:13.800
- Open the door, Mui!
- She said you have another woman!

44:13.880 --> 44:14.760
Nonsense!

44:14.840 --> 44:17.720
Don't get me in trouble
with the housing authority!

44:17.800 --> 44:22.320
- Mui. Open up first!
- We'll get evicted from public housing!

44:22.480 --> 44:27.000
And we'll have to live on the street!
Did you hear what I said?

44:27.080 --> 44:30.440
- I heard you!
- I called the cops 15 minutes ago.

44:30.520 --> 44:34.440
If we can get in,
take her away immediately.

44:34.520 --> 44:36.640
Find a proper woman.

44:36.760 --> 44:40.920
- Granny, you wanted grandchildren!
- I know it's hard.

44:41.440 --> 44:42.800
Mui.

44:43.600 --> 44:44.880
Mui.

44:45.760 --> 44:47.680
Open up. Mui.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.720
Don't kill yourself by overdoing it.

44:58.400 --> 45:01.280
I understand your manly duties.

45:02.480 --> 45:05.440
But overdoing it
doesn't guarantee a child.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.040
She's not like the rest of us.

45:11.800 --> 45:13.680
She's not normal.

45:14.840 --> 45:19.280
Granny, what is this?

45:19.360 --> 45:22.240
You son of a bitch!
Where did you find her?

45:22.960 --> 45:26.560
- At sea.
- I bet she's wet.

45:27.480 --> 45:28.960
Good lord!

45:29.640 --> 45:31.800
She swallows a lot every day.

45:33.160 --> 45:36.800
Did you work this hard
when you were young, Granny?

45:36.880 --> 45:37.960
Don't talk nonsense!

45:38.520 --> 45:40.360
She's truly sick.

45:41.680 --> 45:46.800
I'm afraid you'll be sucked dry.
Take her to the Chinese doctor downstairs.

46:56.920 --> 46:58.320
Mui!

47:03.360 --> 47:04.680
Mui!

47:08.840 --> 47:10.000
Mui!

47:16.320 --> 47:18.800
Baby, you know where mommy went?

47:34.360 --> 47:35.680
Mui!

47:51.360 --> 47:53.200
Hey, what are you doing there?

48:01.600 --> 48:03.720
Go! Come with me!

48:05.160 --> 48:07.760
Stop looking! Let's go!

48:07.840 --> 48:09.920
I'm warning you! Don't try to seduce her!

48:10.000 --> 48:13.640
- Don't blame me! She seduced me first!
- I don't believe it!

48:14.320 --> 48:18.920
My wife's a sea gypsy!
She'll never do such a thing!

48:19.000 --> 48:20.400
Let's go!

49:42.760 --> 49:45.600
Mui, add an extra set of chopsticks!

49:51.160 --> 49:53.320
Is someone joining us?

49:56.720 --> 49:58.000
Who is this?

49:58.080 --> 50:00.080
This is Big Brother.

50:01.400 --> 50:03.080
I'm her father!

50:03.680 --> 50:08.760
Yes, he's her father.
And also her baby's father.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.400
What?

50:10.480 --> 50:13.520
Him? I remarried your daughter to him!

50:13.600 --> 50:14.920
Remarried?

50:15.000 --> 50:17.080
Remarried?
You lost money again?

50:17.840 --> 50:20.080
Don't say "again"!

50:20.160 --> 50:21.560
I was just unlucky that's all!

50:21.640 --> 50:23.720
You'd rather sell my daughter
than the boat?

50:23.800 --> 50:25.440
Sell the boat? Where would I live?

50:25.520 --> 50:28.960
You bastard!
No wonder you're a sore loser!

50:29.040 --> 50:32.040
They really love each other.

50:32.120 --> 50:34.280
- Not my fault!
- You'd lie to me?

50:34.400 --> 50:36.040
Stop! Stop.

50:38.280 --> 50:40.120
You filthy old bastards!

50:40.200 --> 50:44.000
You raped your own daughter!
Married her off to this piece of shit!

50:44.120 --> 50:46.840
And then passed her on to me?
You deserve to be punched!

50:46.920 --> 50:48.320
She's your wife!

50:48.960 --> 50:50.400
And you pimp her out?

50:51.120 --> 50:54.520
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
You deserve to be punched too!

50:55.240 --> 50:58.520
And you want a cut
of her hard-earned cash?

50:59.280 --> 51:03.280
- Hard-earned? She loves it!
- Yes! Not hard-earned at all!

51:03.360 --> 51:04.440
Stop it already!

51:05.840 --> 51:08.520
You're not much better!
Back on land…

51:08.600 --> 51:10.120
Don't come here then, smartass!

51:10.240 --> 51:12.400
You can't survive on salt water!

51:13.280 --> 51:15.320
Young man. What's your name?

51:15.880 --> 51:17.760
Call me Four Eyes.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.320
Now, I'm Big Brother.

51:19.440 --> 51:20.680
He's Second Brother.

51:20.760 --> 51:24.680
- So you're Little Bro.
- Fine. Little Bro then.

51:24.760 --> 51:28.720
You're the youngest here, Little Bro.
From now on, Mui's your responsibility.

51:29.720 --> 51:32.840
Now that we're family,
let's figure something out.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.800
- Start a business.
- I get it now.

51:34.920 --> 51:37.520
You guys want Mui to sell her body again?

51:37.640 --> 51:39.280
Let me tell you something!

51:39.880 --> 51:45.040
As long as I'm around,
don't even think of pimping out Mui!

52:02.880 --> 52:07.280
- Notice any strangers around?
- No.

52:07.880 --> 52:10.400
It's the usual crowd.
Our regulars.

52:10.480 --> 52:13.560
<i>Between these three,</i>
<i>A1 pays 1,8 times for #3 and #10.</i>

52:13.640 --> 52:16.400
<i>A2 pays 3,2 times for #4, #5 and #8.</i>

52:16.480 --> 52:18.320
<i>A3 pays 2,8 times.</i>

52:18.400 --> 52:20.360
<i>A2 has the highest odds.</i>

52:21.000 --> 52:23.960
We're running out of rice!

52:27.520 --> 52:29.400
If we carry on like this,

52:30.160 --> 52:32.760
we'll soon have to beg for food.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.440
Little Bro! She's horny again!

52:46.080 --> 52:47.680
Poor girl…

52:49.320 --> 52:51.400
Was she like that when younger?

52:52.440 --> 52:56.280
Yeah, and I thought she had epilepsy.

52:57.120 --> 53:01.800
Little Bro.
Why don't you find a way to satisfy her.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.840
What if I can't satisfy her?

53:05.920 --> 53:07.800
Why don't you guys try? Okay?

53:07.880 --> 53:13.720
You're the eldest, Big Brother.
You have my respect, please go first!

53:13.800 --> 53:16.040
No way, that's incest.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.800
What a pussy.

53:17.880 --> 53:19.240
Why don't you do it?

53:19.320 --> 53:21.280
I'm handicapped.

53:21.400 --> 53:25.400
Bastards! I'm worn out
and you still want me to do it!

53:26.040 --> 53:27.080
Hey!

53:28.080 --> 53:29.200
Hey!

53:38.000 --> 53:40.160
Wait. I'll be there.

53:44.520 --> 53:46.520
No glove, no love, Little Bro!

53:48.800 --> 53:50.760
Don't bother with those two bastards.

53:53.200 --> 53:55.160
Let's make a baby!

54:35.280 --> 54:37.240
I'm sorry.

54:37.320 --> 54:38.840
I'm sorry.

54:43.040 --> 54:45.840
I'm really sorry. I can't get it up.

54:45.920 --> 54:50.120
I'm as old as Big Brother.

54:51.280 --> 54:53.120
But I've an idea.

55:46.120 --> 55:47.480
As you can all see…

55:48.080 --> 55:51.760
Her abalone-like opening
is completely different from most girls.

55:51.840 --> 55:56.840
Can't you see? Her labia spread outwards.

55:58.040 --> 56:00.680
Isn't abalone seafood? It has wings?

56:01.320 --> 56:03.480
I'll try to answer both your questions.

56:06.760 --> 56:08.960
I'll demonstrate with a papaya.

56:09.040 --> 56:12.040
But remember,
it's also a psychological disorder.

56:12.120 --> 56:13.960
So be extra careful.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.600
There! Can you see?

56:20.160 --> 56:21.040
Like this…

56:21.120 --> 56:23.200
And she'll erupt in orgasmic heaven!
Got it?

56:23.280 --> 56:24.680
But if I push in farther,

56:26.840 --> 56:29.240
then she won't feel it.
Understood?

56:30.240 --> 56:34.760
So…if I stick it in further,
I won't touch that, right?

56:35.480 --> 56:38.000
Not touching it doesn't mean
she won't feel pleasure.

56:38.080 --> 56:40.720
This is the part you need to focus on!

56:40.840 --> 56:42.560
Actually, it is a medical disorder.

56:43.680 --> 56:46.680
A lowly hyper-sexual disorder
for a low-end patient.

56:46.760 --> 56:48.160
Does such an illness exist?

56:48.240 --> 56:50.680
I've heard of low-end consumers.

56:50.760 --> 56:52.080
A pussy can be low-end too?

56:52.920 --> 56:54.080
Of that I'm not certain.

56:54.160 --> 56:57.240
But from a Chinese
and western medical standpoint, yes!

56:58.040 --> 56:59.320
So, how do you fix it?

56:59.440 --> 57:02.800
There's no cure.
But, you can cut it off.

57:02.880 --> 57:05.200
Or send her men every day.

57:05.280 --> 57:07.440
- Every day?
- That's right.

57:07.520 --> 57:10.720
Can she still have children
if we cut it off?

57:10.800 --> 57:12.800
How would I know?
I'm not a gynecologist!

57:12.880 --> 57:14.680
Then why'd you come over?

57:14.760 --> 57:19.160
- No choice! His friend made me come.
- Yes! My grandmother.

57:19.920 --> 57:22.560
Doesn't matter.
I have a suggestion.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.080
What suggestion?

57:24.160 --> 57:26.200
She has a rare gift.

57:26.280 --> 57:31.080
A one-in-a-million beauty!
You must cherish her.

57:31.800 --> 57:34.520
Her pussy might become
cultural heritage someday!

57:34.600 --> 57:37.680
It'll be worth a lot.
Hey! Let's take a photo to commemorate it.

57:38.320 --> 57:39.680
Alright. Alright.

57:42.840 --> 57:46.640
Damn it, not so close!
It'll be like a dark forest!

57:46.720 --> 57:48.280
Pull back! You idiot.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.760
This button…
It vibrates.

58:05.320 --> 58:06.840
- Heads…
- Double-heads.

58:07.520 --> 58:08.680
Five.

58:08.760 --> 58:10.520
Four points. You lose.

58:28.880 --> 58:30.120
Three!

58:32.760 --> 58:33.920
Five points.

58:34.640 --> 58:35.800
Almost.

58:37.200 --> 58:38.240
You lose.

58:39.560 --> 58:40.920
Pay up!

58:41.000 --> 58:42.160
Your turn.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.600
Eight.

58:43.680 --> 58:44.560
Is it working?

58:53.360 --> 58:54.280
Four points.

58:55.680 --> 58:57.480
- Three points!
- Three each…

58:57.560 --> 58:59.360
- Heads.
- Yeah, heads.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.840
- Two.
- Shit! One point.

59:09.720 --> 59:10.960
Eight.

59:25.760 --> 59:27.440
Where's the phone?

59:38.960 --> 59:41.120
You pushed it all the way in?

59:49.280 --> 59:50.840
Should we tie her up?

59:51.720 --> 59:54.120
Like how they tie up drug addicts.

59:54.680 --> 59:56.840
Maybe it'll help to cure her?

59:57.440 --> 59:59.440
Isn't it too brutal?

59:59.560 --> 1:00:01.960
I want to cure her. Tie her up!

1:00:07.240 --> 1:00:09.880
Mui, what are you doing?

1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:12.200
Mui, you alright?

1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:16.600
Mui.

1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:19.120
Be careful!

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:20.200
Mui.

1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:21.480
Don't let her go!

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.440
Mui.

1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:26.760
Mui…Don't!

1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:30.800
Mui. Don't!

1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:43.680
- Is this being abusive?
- No, not if it cures her.

1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:47.280
- And if it doesn't?
- Still no. Little Bro, I support you.

1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:50.240
But we don't know how long she'll survive.

1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:52.640
It'll work.

1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:56.880
It'll work.

1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:34.560
Next.

1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:49.840
Next.

1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:55.080
Mui.

1:03:55.160 --> 1:03:59.880
You're doing well, Mui. Business is great!
Scream louder!

1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:06.560
Mui's a good girl.

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:10.960
The clients want to bring
their own costumes and toys.

1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:12.920
Yes. It's true!

1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.560
Let's jack up the prices.

1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:17.800
It's fair. With Mui's ability…

1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:19.400
That's true.

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:23.600
Let's add an underwater
sexcapade special then.

1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:25.880
What's so funny? Be serious.

1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:37.520
Next up.

1:05:57.480 --> 1:06:02.200
What's with you guys?
Aren't you my friends?

1:06:02.280 --> 1:06:05.280
Let's drop the personal feelings today.

1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:08.600
We're here to get laid.
Don't think of us as friends.

1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:10.800
But that's… like screwing my wife?

1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:13.440
Just close your eyes
and don't think about it.

1:06:13.560 --> 1:06:16.280
Blame it on Shui for bragging about her.

1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:17.960
You…

1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:19.480
You bastards!

1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:21.640
Don't get too worked up about it.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.560
Don't let personal feelings
interfere with business!

1:06:27.080 --> 1:06:30.560
That's right. Bro!
You can't achieve much with that attitude!

1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:35.880
- That's right. Don't limit yourself.
- Fuck you, bastards!

1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:41.880
So good.

1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:50.960
I've struggled with this for a while.

1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:53.800
We grew up together.
He's not just a friend.

1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:56.280
To be honest,
I don't really want to fuck her.

1:06:56.400 --> 1:06:58.160
Not me. I'm not so pretentious.

1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:02.120
I know this sounds vicious.

1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:04.880
Like a terrorist…
But ain't I right?

1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:07.520
Well, think of it this way.

1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:09.840
If you go to Mongkok to get a hooker,

1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:11.480
would you care
about who she is?

1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:13.680
Fuck no.
I only need to know she's a whore.

1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:20.880
- Even that asshole wants a shot!
- Shut up. It's just business.

1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:40.680
- Who's she married to in Hong Kong?
- Me.

1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:43.960
- Who are you?
- I'm her father.

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:47.480
There's been reports
of illegal activities here.

1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:51.320
- Drugs?
- Not drugs. Prostitution.

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:54.160
No one lives here! Which boat?

1:07:54.880 --> 1:07:56.880
You shouldn't dock here.

1:07:56.960 --> 1:08:00.600
Then where can we live?
Can you get me public housing?

1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:04.480
- Apply for it.
- Apply? Are you kidding me?

1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:06.760
Whatever, you can't dock your boat here.

1:08:06.840 --> 1:08:09.040
You must leave
Gin Drinker's Bay by 7:00 p.m.!

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:12.640
If you show up here again,
we'll impound your boat and arrest you.

1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:13.840
Understand?

1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:54.640
Nothingness-sky, energy,
air

1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:56.600
No content
No result - Off the ground,

1:08:56.720 --> 1:08:58.479
above the ground - Unused

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:43.479
- How is it?
- She's having an episode again.

1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:47.640
It's becoming more serious.

1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:54.960
Okay.

1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:06.680
- What's this?
- An electric massage chair.

1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:08.080
She wants a massage?

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:12.280
You old fool, lagging behind the times.

1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:16.000
I suspect Mui's a siren of the sea.

1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:22.400
- She squeals just like a dolphin.
- Siren my ass. What makes you think that?

1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:25.520
Why don't you go to Lantau Island
and check it out?

1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:28.200
- Check what?
- Your ancestry.

1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:31.720
I once read a Hong Kong
folk tale about Lu Ting.

1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:35.320
It said they originated
in the Pearl River Delta.

1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:39.240
They fled war and ended up
on Lantau Island.

1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:42.280
It's in the "New Essays of Guangdong".

1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:44.760
If a seafarer chances upon a siren,

1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:47.200
thrust the male member
to tame the lustful maiden.

1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:48.960
And break her evil spell.

1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:52.600
Smoke! Fire! A big fire!

1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:53.920
Smoke!

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.320
Help!

1:10:58.480 --> 1:10:59.800
Help!

1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:07.280
Anyone there?
Want to do business?

1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:14.760
Want to do business?

1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:17.320
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:28.560
Want to do business?

1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:31.920
Go home and eat shit!

1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:34.840
Brother.
Let's go somewhere else.

1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:34.680
Police came to warn them.
Little Bro left with his family.

1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:38.160
- Where's Four Eyes?
- Four Eyes is Little Bro.

1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:40.160
How unfortunate.

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:44.840
- What do you want with him?
- I got in trouble in Zhuhai a while back.

1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:48.360
He bailed me out
so I'm here to return his money.

1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:50.760
Give it to me then.
I lent the money to him.

1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:54.200
Give it to you?
No. Better hand it to him directly.

1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:57.360
Why didn't you return here
with us last time?

1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:01.560
It wasn't easy for me.
I was locked up for a whole month.

1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:03.680
I had to write a Letter of Repentance

1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:06.240
and attend rehabilitation classes
before release.

1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:08.840
After rehabilitation,
you are not a hooker anymore.

1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:11.240
What hooker?
Your mom didn't teach you manners?

1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:12.680
Sorry.

1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:19.000
I'll bring some mates along
to support you someday.

1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:21.080
Support me?

1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:24.080
You go to China to get hookers,
how can you afford me?

1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:31.720
But why not?

1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:35.200
I don't know where I'll go next.

1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:37.840
The government's promoting
the Greater Bay Area.

1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:39.080
I'll take a look there.

1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:43.160
Forget it. I'm sure there's a school here
that will take you in. Don't be a hooker.

1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:45.560
Fuck you, Fatty!
Try not to fall into the sea.

1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.360
Where are we now?

1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:05.920
Why are there so many fishing boats?

1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:10.560
This is Hong Kong's Aberdeen Fishing Port.
Of course there are many boats.

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:13.680
Good morning, Boss!

1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:15.600
Want to do business?

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:22.560
Want to do business?

1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:26.960
- No response.
- Keep going.

1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:30.600
Hey! That one?

1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:35.400
- Keep looking.
- Keep looking.

1:14:36.040 --> 1:14:38.640
Hey, Boss! Want to do business?

1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:42.240
- What?
- Go closer.

1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:43.960
What business?

1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:46.000
Take a look.

1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:52.760
- You shitting me? Do it in that tiny boat?
- No. She can come over to your boat.

1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:55.160
No way! Don't dirty my boat!

1:14:56.200 --> 1:15:00.440
Alright.
Pops, I'm going over for a short while.

1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:01.720
Hey! We have business!

1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:12.240
What the fuck is that?

1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:14.560
Hey!

1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:16.160
Hey!

1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:19.240
Who the fuck are you guys?
Motherfuckers!

1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:22.120
You still pimp her out
after she pops out a bastard child?

1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:27.200
Have you no conscience? No shame?
You crazy shitheads!

1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:37.240
I'll still treat the baby as my own.

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:40.720
Don't talk. Just eat.
You need the energy.

1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:44.000
We can't keep doing this.

1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:47.280
It won't help cure her disorder.

1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:50.760
She's fine now.

1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:53.280
It's fixing the symptom
but it's not a cure.

1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:56.800
Shall we go ashore to get some meds?
Give it a try?

1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:59.200
After getting the meds,
we'll leave right away.

1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:00.160
Hey, Second Bro.

1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:03.120
I remember a book I read.

1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:06.040
What are you getting at? Get to the point.

1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:08.720
If Mui's a demon,

1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:12.280
then we have to find
a Buddha to restrain her.

1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:15.360
What? I don't know.

1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:22.120
No. You are children of the ocean.
So, a fish will be a Buddha of the sea.

1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:23.600
What do you mean?

1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:40.440
Told you to get meds
and you bought a fish?

1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:42.760
Are you insane? Buying such a giant one?

1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:44.520
You want to fuck up her pussy?

1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:46.800
Seems I have to be
the decision maker again.

1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:49.480
We'll work with what we've got.

1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:51.920
Put two layers of protection on the fish!

1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:53.960
Bring the condoms.

1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:00.040
Come on. Put it on.

1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:33.600
Tough it out Mui.

1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:56.200
- Yummy.
- Eat more then.

1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:59.200
Haven't seen her so happy in a while.

1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:07.200
Can't believe an eel tamed Mui.
And it tastes great too.

1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:11.200
Attaboy. Once we dock,
buy more eel, Bro.

1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:14.360
In case Mui has another episode,
get a few extra eels next time.

1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:16.720
- We're not rolling in money.
- We are.

1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:22.760
We were flooded with online bookings
while you were cooking.

1:21:22.840 --> 1:21:26.400
And we got many likes too!
We'll have money again.

1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:28.800
Look at your scrawny face.

1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:31.640
Perfect for a pimp.
You skinny ass.

1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:34.200
Thank you.

1:21:35.160 --> 1:21:39.640
Mui, we're back in business again.
Aren't you happy?

1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:42.800
Not happy.

1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:45.520
- Not happy? Why not?
- Why not?

1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:48.440
With fish…Happy.

1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:50.040
Fish?

1:21:51.520 --> 1:21:56.120
Perhaps Little Bro's story is true.

1:21:56.200 --> 1:22:00.000
Since we're so close to Lantau Island,
let's go take a look.

1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:00.960
Okay.

1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:03.480
Good!

1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:07.520
But can we get any business there?

1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:11.440
- Where there are men, there are customers.
- Good. I'll put some bait up online.

1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:21.400
Wow! Fireworks.

1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:26.320
Why so sudden? Where are we now?

1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:32.920
The Gods must have sensed our joy,
and fired off fireworks to celebrate!

1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:36.720
- It's Disneyland.
- For real?

1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:40.560
- So we passed Disneyland?
- Let's go there next year!

1:22:40.640 --> 1:22:45.760
I won't waste that kind of money.
They do it every night at this time.

1:22:47.400 --> 1:22:50.520
Seahorse is the perfect nickname for you.

1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:54.800
Money means everything, no matter what.

1:22:56.040 --> 1:22:59.640
I'm not like Big Brother.
Cowardly like a sea turtle.

1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:01.800
And you, Goldfish.

1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:06.560
Goldfish?
What about my daughter?

1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:12.080
I got it.
There's a fish that fits her perfectly.

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:15.160
It's a tonguefish!

1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:18.320
A tonguefish?

1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:34.520
Bro! Tai O's waterway is too narrow.
Let's use your boat.

1:23:34.600 --> 1:23:37.440
- What about your boat?
- Dock it at the perimeter first.

1:23:41.200 --> 1:23:43.080
Mr. Chan!

1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:45.920
Mr. Chan!

1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:52.360
Mr. Chan!

1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:56.320
Who the fuck is screaming out there?

1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:01.080
- Mr. Chan!
- Can't you see I'm meditating!

1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:03.240
Are you Mr. Chan?

1:24:03.320 --> 1:24:08.760
We're from Ocean Health Services,
I have your delivery here.

1:24:08.840 --> 1:24:10.160
What delivery?

1:24:12.280 --> 1:24:13.880
Hey. Show it to him.

1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:18.720
Wow! There's a baby too.

1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:21.280
Is it buy one, get one free?
Quite creative!

1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:23.960
I like that. Come on up.

1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:43.560
Boss, give me a good price for the fish.

1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:47.360
Then what will I live on?
Get lost.

1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:50.080
You whiner.

1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:57.600
You filthy girl.

1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:46.840
Not so loud.

1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:01.240
Hey, sir.

1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:05.480
Do you know who painted
this Lu Ting map of Lantau?

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:08.440
How would I know?
I don't even know who put it up there.

1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:09.760
Lu Ting!

1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:13.000
The legendary half-fish,
half-man creature.

1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:16.200
It is able to tame evil spirits
and remove spells.

1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:21.240
Brother. Go to a temple
to remove evil spells.

1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:25.720
This proves Lantau's
connection to the Pearl River Delta.

1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:26.880
Look!

1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:29.560
Here. This curvaceous feminine opening!

1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:34.800
Which means, back in 410 A.D.,
during the Eastern Jin dynasty,

1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:38.320
Lu Ting traveled to Lantau Island

1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:39.760
and became Lantau locals.

1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:43.120
- Are you a property agent?
- No, sir.

1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:45.560
Aren't you a native of Lantau Island?

1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:49.160
Mr. Leung!

1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:03.200
Mr. Lee!

1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:12.880
Mr. Chow!

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000
So many likes.

1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:21.960
Mr. Wong!

1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:26.000
Mr. Ho!

1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:34.480
Mr. Lau!

1:27:56.800 --> 1:27:59.560
Mui has a powerful voice.

1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:09.240
Sounds amazing.
Just like dolphins out at sea.

1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:12.960
Let's catch that slut! Beat her to death!

1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:21.240
She's over there. Catch the whore!

1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:28.600
It's me. Shui.
I'm your husband's good friend.

1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:29.720
I'm back again.

1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:32.640
I've been searching online,
and followed you to Tai O.

1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:36.200
It's touching, right?
Look what I brought.

1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:37.560
Happy?

1:28:37.640 --> 1:28:40.360
I'm really into you.

1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:42.920
I'm inside.
Let's start.

1:28:51.320 --> 1:28:53.880
My bad.
Sorry.

1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:57.000
I came too fucking fast.

1:28:57.960 --> 1:29:02.080
Strange.
Darn, why is it like this?

1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:20.120
Must be this damn arm.

1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:22.800
I lost too much blood back then.

1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:25.480
It must have drained me.

1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:27.480
Lost all my vigor.

1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:30.240
You know. I ain't…

1:29:30.320 --> 1:29:33.360
I was so awesome last time.
Right?

1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:36.760
You remember.
I'm not like this.

1:29:37.920 --> 1:29:41.120
We were both in heaven last time.
It was great, wasn't it?

1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:44.560
Let me rest a bit.
Just for a moment.

1:29:45.320 --> 1:29:47.960
Ten minutes.
Just ten minutes.

1:29:48.040 --> 1:29:49.560
We'll do it again, okay?

1:29:49.640 --> 1:29:51.080
I'll…

1:29:51.160 --> 1:29:53.720
We'll do it again, okay?
Don't be upset.

1:29:55.800 --> 1:29:59.880
No. You…
Ask my wife if you don't believe me.

1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:03.400
My wife says I'm really good in bed.

1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:07.080
How about I give you her phone number.

1:30:07.240 --> 1:30:09.640
Call her and ask.

1:30:09.720 --> 1:30:13.200
I gave her two kids.
So I have no problem at all.

1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:14.840
Don't you agree?

1:30:14.920 --> 1:30:16.320
But the fact is…

1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:19.280
we haven't had sex for some time.

1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:24.120
Could it be that?
It has affected my performance?

1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:29.560
Must be it.
Not humping for a while.

1:30:29.640 --> 1:30:32.200
It made me come too quickly.

1:30:33.520 --> 1:30:36.600
It's alright.
Let me rest for a bit.

1:30:38.400 --> 1:30:39.840
Don't be upset.

1:30:44.280 --> 1:30:47.120
You look so sweet even crying.

1:30:49.200 --> 1:30:50.240
Here.

1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:53.240
One drag of this
and you'll be less nervous.

1:30:53.320 --> 1:30:54.520
Here. Go on!

1:30:57.760 --> 1:31:01.520
I know you're not happy.
Got you all excited.

1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:04.440
Well, even the very best
can stumble once in a while.

1:31:04.520 --> 1:31:08.000
Men can be like this sometimes.

1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:10.400
What are you doing?

1:31:11.520 --> 1:31:16.480
You're sick too?
So it's not just me.

1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:20.880
Then you can't blame me.
Right?

1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:23.800
Hey! What are you doing?

1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:28.160
Don't fuck with me!
I'm warning you!

1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:30.280
Hey!
You're getting violent!

1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:33.720
You fucking bitch!
Stop throwing stuff!

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:38.440
Who do you think you are?
You're just a hooker!

1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:42.440
Don't think I can't hurt you
because I'm injured!

1:31:42.520 --> 1:31:44.160
You're a whore!

1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:47.960
Hey! Stop it now!

1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:49.440
Fucking bitch!

1:31:50.160 --> 1:31:51.200
Fucking cunt!

1:31:51.280 --> 1:31:53.440
Hurry. What's wrong?

1:31:54.880 --> 1:31:56.080
It's you, Shui!

1:31:56.160 --> 1:31:57.000
It's me!

1:31:57.080 --> 1:31:59.520
What's wrong with your wife?
A fucking attitude!

1:31:59.600 --> 1:32:01.600
I didn't even touch her and she ran off!

1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:03.200
- Go after her!
- Look for her.

1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:07.200
- Follow me!
- Okay.

1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:09.520
- Beat that slut!
- Catch her!

1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:11.480
We must get her!

1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:14.080
We must kill her!

1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:15.840
Mui!

1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:19.160
Mui!

1:32:25.080 --> 1:32:26.920
Hey! Are they on the boat already?

1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:34.920
Should be around here. Keep looking!

1:32:36.160 --> 1:32:38.480
I don't know. Where are they?

1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:40.960
Don't know where they are.
We'll find them.

1:32:41.040 --> 1:32:43.480
- Are they on the boat?
- No. The boat's right here.

1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:45.400
The boat's right here!

1:32:45.480 --> 1:32:48.040
Call the cops! Secure their boat.
Don't let them go!

1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:36.280
Mui!

1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:39.040
Mui!

1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:46.800
Mui!

1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:48.640
Mui.

1:33:53.920 --> 1:33:54.880
Mui!

1:33:55.720 --> 1:33:57.640
It's me, Little Bro.

1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:00.840
No! She's a bit traumatized.

1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:02.360
Mui!

1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:04.520
Where are you going?

1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:07.320
Let's go home.

1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:12.720
I'm Little Bro.

1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:17.600
Dad and Bro are both here.

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:23.640
Let's go home, okay?
Yes! Let's go home!

1:34:23.760 --> 1:34:26.000
I'll find you a stronger guy!

1:34:26.120 --> 1:34:29.200
- Be a good girl!
- Let's go home.

1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:31.200
Let's go home.

1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:39.080
Let's go home.

1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:42.000
Let's go home. Come…

1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:00.640
- Mui!
- Grab the net!

1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:03.880
- Mui!
- Grab the net!

1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:05.560
Mui!

1:35:21.400 --> 1:35:22.880
Mui!

1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:50.480
Mui!

1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:00.320
Mui!

1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:02.560
Let's go home!

1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:48.160
<i>Up next, the local news.</i>

1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:51.120
<i>The estimated 9,95 billion yuan</i>
<i>HK-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge</i>

1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:54.160
<i>is officially opened today.</i>

1:36:54.240 --> 1:36:58.520
<i>Chinese President Xi Jinping launched the</i>
<i>bridge at an opening ceremony in Zhuhai,</i>

1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:01.360
<i>attended by HK's first female</i>
<i>Chief Executive, Carrie Lam,</i>

1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:04.160
<i>and former Chief Executive</i>
<i>Leung Chun Ying.</i>

1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:08.920
<i>This massive landmark</i>
<i>in the Greater Bay Area is hoped to boost</i>

1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:12.640
<i>the economic development between HK,</i>
<i>Macau and mainland China.</i>

1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:17.920
<i>According to the HK Transport and Housing</i>
<i>Bureau, this mega bridge ran over budget,</i>

1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:22.080
<i>with all three districts proportionately</i>
<i>spending an additional 4,6 billion yuan.</i>

1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:24.800
<i>HK alone contributed 2 billion yuan.</i>

1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:28.520
<i>Given that it had sought LegCo's approval</i>
<i>for this additional funding,</i>

1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:33.080
<i>it is questioned if Hong Kong government</i>
<i>would return the wealth to the people,</i>

1:37:33.160 --> 1:37:35.880
<i>once the bridge has</i>
<i>an operating surplus in the future.</i>

1:37:37.400 --> 1:37:38.880
So this is the bridge?

1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:42.120
Which is the left and the right?

1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:44.480
Go forwards and you'll reach
my native Zhuhai.

1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:46.280
Go backwards and it's Hong Kong.

1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:56.360
Where are we going now?

1:37:56.440 --> 1:37:59.560
You still want to track down
Lu Ting to cure Mui?

1:37:59.640 --> 1:38:03.160
No, Mui's not a Lu Ting.

1:38:03.320 --> 1:38:05.800
If so, she'd have swam off
a long time ago.

1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:07.760
Then where should we go now?

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:10.280
How the hell would I know?
I'm not from Hong Kong.

1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:11.680
Don't ask me!
