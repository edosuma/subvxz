GRAHAM:

00:03.542 --> 00:05.333
Thanks for coming

00:03.542 --> 00:05.333
to help, you guys.

00:05.375 --> 00:07.291
The sensors over here

00:05.375 --> 00:07.291
on Wayward Island

00:07.333 --> 00:08.500
should have

00:07.333 --> 00:08.500
a ton of intel

00:08.542 --> 00:10.125
about last

00:08.542 --> 00:10.125
night's earthquake.

00:10.166 --> 00:12.083
You call that

00:10.166 --> 00:12.083
an earthquake?

00:12.125 --> 00:13.750
It barely knocked over

00:12.125 --> 00:13.750
a lawn chair.

00:13.792 --> 00:15.709
But the next one

00:13.792 --> 00:15.709
could be disastrous.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.583
That's why the data

00:15.750 --> 00:17.583
is invaluable.

00:17.625 --> 00:19.959
It's like

00:17.625 --> 00:19.959
geological Christmas!

00:20.000 --> 00:21.500
Ho-ho-ho!

00:25.208 --> 00:27.542
Hey, that's where we found

00:25.208 --> 00:27.542
Ira, isn't it?

00:27.583 --> 00:29.542
Ira the caveman?

00:29.583 --> 00:32.500
That's right.

00:29.583 --> 00:32.500
He's out here somewhere.

00:32.542 --> 00:34.709
I wonder if he felt

00:32.542 --> 00:34.709
the quake last night.

He might still use the cave

00:37.709 --> 00:40.208
as his shelter.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.166
Maybe we should check on him.

Everybody okay?

What?

Ah!

Unbelievable.

BOULDER:

02:00.959 --> 02:02.542
It's Cybertronian,

02:00.959 --> 02:02.542
all right.

02:02.583 --> 02:05.458
But...I've never seen

02:02.583 --> 02:05.458
one like it.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.291
It's ancient, way

02:05.500 --> 02:08.291
before our time.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.750
Looks like

02:08.333 --> 02:09.750
a cargo ship.

02:09.792 --> 02:12.417
It appears to have suffered

02:09.792 --> 02:12.417
some sort of collision.

02:12.458 --> 02:13.709
But with what?

02:13.750 --> 02:15.166
There are two

02:13.750 --> 02:15.166
Bots inside

02:15.208 --> 02:16.750
who would

02:15.208 --> 02:16.750
know for sure.

02:18.959 --> 02:20.333
( grunts )

02:25.250 --> 02:27.917
You know, uh, maybe

02:25.250 --> 02:27.917
we should come back later.

02:27.959 --> 02:30.000
Those guys have

02:27.959 --> 02:30.000
been in here forever.

02:30.041 --> 02:31.709
What's a few more years?

02:32.834 --> 02:34.000
I see why this

02:32.834 --> 02:34.000
thing didn't

02:34.041 --> 02:36.583
show up on our

02:34.041 --> 02:36.583
Energon scanners.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.000
It must've been

02:36.625 --> 02:38.000
running on fumes.

02:38.041 --> 02:40.625
CODY:

02:38.041 --> 02:40.625
So these Autobots must be

02:40.667 --> 02:42.583
the ones Ira met

02:40.667 --> 02:42.583
in prehistoric days.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.834
But why would they land,

02:44.875 --> 02:47.417
save some cave people

02:44.875 --> 02:47.417
from meteors,

02:47.458 --> 02:48.667
then go to sleep?

02:48.709 --> 02:51.333
An excellent question, Francine.

02:51.375 --> 02:52.542
Perhaps their computer can shed

02:52.583 --> 02:55.583
some light on the matter.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.750
Then again,

02:55.625 --> 02:57.750
perhaps not.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.375
You know, airplanes have a

02:57.792 --> 03:00.375
"black box" that records

03:00.417 --> 03:02.333
everything that happens

03:00.417 --> 03:02.333
during a flight.

03:02.375 --> 03:04.500
Do Cybertronian ships have

03:02.375 --> 03:04.500
anything like that?

03:04.542 --> 03:06.667
The ship's

03:04.542 --> 03:06.667
Primary Memory Core.

right around...

03:08.834 --> 03:10.750
here.

03:12.542 --> 03:14.542
It's sustained

03:12.542 --> 03:14.542
some damage.

03:14.583 --> 03:15.917
Maybe Doc can

03:14.583 --> 03:15.917
help us recover

03:15.959 --> 03:17.792
the data and

03:15.959 --> 03:17.792
find out what happened.

03:17.834 --> 03:19.917
Or we could

03:17.834 --> 03:19.917
just ask these guys.

03:19.959 --> 03:22.625

It's not.

can't tell them apart.

07:09.834 --> 07:11.583
Why're you dragging

07:09.834 --> 07:11.583
that thing with us?

07:11.625 --> 07:13.542
We're hoping

07:11.625 --> 07:13.542
to find out exactly

07:13.583 --> 07:14.750
what happened to

07:13.583 --> 07:14.750
your ship.

07:14.792 --> 07:17.959
Guys,

07:14.792 --> 07:17.959
incoming transmission.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.709
BOULDER:

07:21.208 --> 07:22.709
Blurr! Salvage!

07:22.750 --> 07:24.500
Come on, you're gonna

07:22.750 --> 07:24.500
want to hear this.

07:24.542 --> 07:26.166
Yeah, coming!

07:27.333 --> 07:29.000
I just spoke with

07:27.333 --> 07:29.000
Optimus Prime.

07:29.041 --> 07:31.208
He's coming from the mainland

07:29.041 --> 07:31.208
to meet us at the lab.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.625
Really?

07:32.667 --> 07:34.291
I'm meeting a Prime?

07:34.333 --> 07:35.917
It's quite

07:34.333 --> 07:35.917
an occasion.

07:35.959 --> 07:38.500
It's not every day

07:35.959 --> 07:38.500
we find new Bots.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.083
OPTIMUS:

07:39.750 --> 07:42.083
It is good

07:39.750 --> 07:42.083
to see new faces.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.500
Salvage, sir.

07:44.542 --> 07:45.750
Name's Blurr.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.083
Welcome to Earth.

07:47.125 --> 07:48.959
We have built

07:47.125 --> 07:48.959
a new home here,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.125
in partnership

07:49.000 --> 07:51.125
with humans.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.542
So can you.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.959
Love to, really,

07:52.583 --> 07:54.959
your Primeness,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.959
but, uh,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.959
it's a big galaxy.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.125
I got places to go,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.125
races to win.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.875
I recommend you give Earth

07:59.166 --> 08:01.875
a chance, Blurr.

08:01.917 --> 08:04.750
It has more to offer

08:01.917 --> 08:04.750
than you realize.

08:04.792 --> 08:08.709
We are required to remain

08:04.792 --> 08:08.709
robots in disguise.

08:08.750 --> 08:12.333
Humans are not yet ready

08:08.750 --> 08:12.333
to accept aliens among them.

08:12.375 --> 08:15.166
That's supposed to, uh,

08:12.375 --> 08:15.166
get me to stay?

08:15.208 --> 08:19.875
At least consider scanning

08:15.208 --> 08:19.875
an Earth-friendly form.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.208
Ahh. Fine.

08:24.041 --> 08:26.583
SALVAGE:

08:24.041 --> 08:26.583
So we can scan

08:24.041 --> 08:26.583
anything in here,

08:26.625 --> 08:28.208
and that's our

08:26.625 --> 08:28.208
new vehicle mode?

08:28.250 --> 08:30.000
That is correct, Salvage.

08:30.041 --> 08:32.041
All right.

08:30.041 --> 08:32.041
Ha, ha.

08:32.083 --> 08:35.291
I, for one, am starting to get

08:32.083 --> 08:35.291
the appeal of this planet.

08:35.333 --> 08:39.000
(  rock theme playing  )

08:39.041 --> 08:41.000
( gasps )

08:41.041 --> 08:42.583
That symbol.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.625
The same one

08:42.625 --> 08:44.625
on the treasure box.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.041
The recycle bin.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.000
Yeah, this truck collects

08:46.083 --> 08:48.000
those items, and--

08:48.041 --> 08:50.667
I get it,

08:48.041 --> 08:50.667
a moving treasure chest.

08:50.709 --> 08:53.750
Ah, just think of all the stuff

08:50.709 --> 08:53.750
I could fit in there.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.875
While cargo room

08:53.792 --> 08:55.875
is important,

08:55.917 --> 08:57.166
there are

08:55.917 --> 08:57.166
other vehicles

08:57.208 --> 08:58.625
that would perhaps

08:57.208 --> 08:58.625
prove more...

08:58.667 --> 09:01.166
practical

08:58.667 --> 09:01.166
for everyday use?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.959
( sighs )

09:03.000 --> 09:04.792
Remember, Chase.

09:04.834 --> 09:07.250
Sometimes

09:04.834 --> 09:07.250
the vehicle chooses you.

09:07.291 --> 09:10.208
I think you've made

09:07.291 --> 09:10.208
an excellent choice, Salvage.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.083
Prepare to scan.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.959
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:21.792 --> 09:25.166
SALVAGE:

09:21.792 --> 09:25.166
Ha! It feels perfect.

09:25.208 --> 09:26.625
Can I try it out?

09:33.291 --> 09:34.667
I love it!

09:34.709 --> 09:35.917
Who ever thought I would--

09:35.959 --> 09:37.083
( tires screeching )

09:37.125 --> 09:38.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:44.291 --> 09:45.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:45.709 --> 09:47.625
( tires screeching )

09:53.917 --> 09:57.125
Woo-hoo!

09:57.166 --> 09:59.250
This mode is so me!

09:59.291 --> 10:01.000
And by me, I mean epic!

10:01.041 --> 10:03.375
( coughing )

10:01.041 --> 10:03.375
Not funny.

10:03.417 --> 10:06.041
I think I swallowed

10:03.417 --> 10:06.041
my swashplate.

10:06.083 --> 10:10.000
Hey, hotshot, maybe you better

10:06.083 --> 10:10.000
take it down a notch.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.125
Hey, Captain, I'm just

10:10.041 --> 10:12.125
having a little fun.

10:12.875 --> 10:15.667
Everyone, gather round.

10:15.709 --> 10:17.875
Now that you both have

10:15.709 --> 10:17.875
new modes,

10:17.917 --> 10:20.917
I have discussed your status

10:17.917 --> 10:20.917
with Chief Burns.

10:20.959 --> 10:23.458
While your paths

10:20.959 --> 10:23.458
are always your own,

10:23.500 --> 10:25.250
the Chief and I

10:23.500 --> 10:25.250
are offering you

10:25.291 --> 10:27.125
the opportunity

10:25.291 --> 10:27.125
to stay here

10:27.166 --> 10:30.875
and train as

10:27.166 --> 10:30.875
Rescue Force Recruits.

10:30.917 --> 10:32.667
What?

10:30.917 --> 10:32.667
An unexpected turn of events!

10:32.709 --> 10:34.083
Sir.

10:32.709 --> 10:34.083
Great.

10:34.125 --> 10:36.125
Whoa. Noble!

10:36.166 --> 10:38.667
Sir,

10:36.166 --> 10:38.667
I'd be honored.

10:38.709 --> 10:41.959
So...I'd get to keep

10:38.709 --> 10:41.959
these sweet wheels?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.667
All right, Earth!

10:44.709 --> 10:46.125
Run for cover!

10:46.166 --> 10:47.333
( tires screeching )

10:47.375 --> 10:49.458
I knew it.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.458
Did you hear that?

10:49.500 --> 10:50.834
We're being replaced.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.917
Retired.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.917
Sent out to pasture.

10:52.959 --> 10:54.208
Blades,

10:52.959 --> 10:54.208
I don't think--

10:54.250 --> 10:56.333
Next month, we'll be

10:54.250 --> 10:56.333
in the Old Bots' Home,

10:56.375 --> 10:59.417
Uh-huh, playing checkers

10:56.375 --> 10:59.417
and griping about the food.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.291
And we don't even eat.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.125
With all due respect,

11:01.333 --> 11:03.125
sir.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.333
Those two aren't exactly

11:03.166 --> 11:05.333
Rescue Bot material.

11:05.375 --> 11:07.458
Especially

11:05.375 --> 11:07.458
Mr. Speed Demon.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.834
Which means they will

11:07.500 --> 11:10.834
require expert guidance.

11:10.875 --> 11:13.000
That's why I would like

11:10.875 --> 11:13.000
you and your team

11:13.041 --> 11:15.291
to train them

11:13.041 --> 11:15.291
yourselves.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.500
Us?

11:15.333 --> 11:16.500
Teachers?

11:16.542 --> 11:17.875
Seriously?

11:16.542 --> 11:17.875
Of course, Sir.

11:17.917 --> 11:19.083
If those are your orders.

11:19.125 --> 11:20.917
Perhaps you can begin by

11:20.959 --> 11:24.166
helping them adjust to their

11:20.959 --> 11:24.166
new forms and surroundings.

11:24.208 --> 11:25.333
I'll take Salvage!

11:25.375 --> 11:27.750
I know just where to start.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.375
( Salvage gasps )

11:30.417 --> 11:31.875
CODY:

11:30.417 --> 11:31.875
Well, what do

11:30.417 --> 11:31.875
you think?

11:31.917 --> 11:33.208
Ya-hoo!

11:33.250 --> 11:34.875
Who-hoo-hoo-hoo!

11:34.917 --> 11:37.000
(  playful theme playing  )

11:41.417 --> 11:44.417
Well, this goes here,

11:41.417 --> 11:44.417
yes, let's see...

11:44.458 --> 11:45.959
( sighs )

11:46.000 --> 11:48.166
Can't believe people think

11:46.000 --> 11:48.166
this is junk.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.500
I'll find a use

11:48.208 --> 11:50.500
for all of it.

11:50.542 --> 11:54.542
Everything finds

11:50.542 --> 11:54.542
its purpose...eventually.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.834
And Cody,

11:54.583 --> 11:56.834
thanks for bringing me here.

11:56.875 --> 11:59.875
Sure thing, Salvage.

11:59.917 --> 12:01.417
( playing harmonica music )

12:01.458 --> 12:05.166
Huh, what...is...that?

12:06.125 --> 12:08.125
(  mellow theme playing  )

12:10.417 --> 12:12.291
( barks )

12:13.250 --> 12:15.083
Ah, used to have one

12:13.250 --> 12:15.083
just like you.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.083
Hey, roto up!

12:18.125 --> 12:19.542
( barks )

12:19.583 --> 12:22.041
Aw, good boy!

12:19.583 --> 12:22.041
Yes you are.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.250
Yes you are!

12:23.291 --> 12:25.375
( laughs )

12:25.417 --> 12:27.917
I'm Chief Burns.

12:25.417 --> 12:27.917
This is Kade,

12:27.959 --> 12:29.458
Dani, and you've

12:27.959 --> 12:29.458
met Graham.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.417
Yeah. Charmed.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.917
So, uh, where's

12:31.458 --> 12:33.917
the racetrack?

12:33.959 --> 12:36.083
Captain here said I could test

12:33.959 --> 12:36.083
my speed against his.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.166
A race car

12:36.125 --> 12:38.166
against a fire truck?

12:38.208 --> 12:39.834
That doesn't

12:38.208 --> 12:39.834
seem very fair.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.583
Which is why we're

12:39.875 --> 12:41.583
not racing on a track.

12:41.625 --> 12:42.959
We're racing...

12:43.000 --> 12:44.417
on an obstacle course.

12:44.458 --> 12:47.250
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

12:47.291 --> 12:49.083
Unless you're

12:47.291 --> 12:49.083
not up for it.

12:49.125 --> 12:52.458
Up for it? In the words

12:49.125 --> 12:52.458
of the great Alpha Trion,

12:52.500 --> 12:54.125
one-two-three-go!

12:54.166 --> 12:55.291
( tires screech )

12:55.333 --> 12:56.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:56.542 --> 12:58.125
BLURR:

12:56.542 --> 12:58.125
Gotta be faster than that

12:58.166 --> 13:00.083
or we'll have to change your

12:58.166 --> 13:00.083
name to "Stop Light."

13:18.250 --> 13:19.417
All right!

13:18.250 --> 13:19.417
Woo-hoo!

13:19.458 --> 13:21.333
Yeah!

13:19.458 --> 13:21.333
MAN: Go, Heatwave!

13:21.375 --> 13:25.166
HEATWAVE:

13:21.375 --> 13:25.166
What's the matter, Race Car?

13:21.375 --> 13:25.166
Can't keep up?

13:27.542 --> 13:28.917
( crowd gasping )

13:28.959 --> 13:30.166
No!

13:28.959 --> 13:30.166
Uh-oh!

13:33.542 --> 13:35.375
Blurr! Hang on!

13:36.959 --> 13:38.166
( tires screeching )

13:38.208 --> 13:40.667
Ha-ha-ha! What's the matter,

13:38.208 --> 13:40.667
fire truck?

13:40.709 --> 13:42.417
Can't keep up?

13:45.667 --> 13:49.291
Ha-ha-ha.

13:45.667 --> 13:49.291
Yes. I beat you.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.166
I'm awesome. Yeah.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.834
But that was

13:51.208 --> 13:52.834
cheating.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.959
Ha-ha-ha.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.959
Not if you win.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.458
Technically, no regulations

13:55.000 --> 13:57.458
forbid subterfuge

13:57.500 --> 13:59.166
in a training exercise.

13:59.208 --> 14:00.542
But still...

14:00.583 --> 14:03.417
Pfft. Rules. You know,

14:00.583 --> 14:03.417
those cave-people I saved

14:03.458 --> 14:05.583
didn't waste time counting

14:03.458 --> 14:05.583
how many seat belts I had.

14:05.625 --> 14:07.166
They just jumped in.

14:07.208 --> 14:09.291
You didn't have

14:07.208 --> 14:09.291
seat belts back then.

14:09.333 --> 14:12.291
Or even

14:09.333 --> 14:12.291
a vehicle mode.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.250
I was just--

14:12.333 --> 14:15.250
It was a joke, okay?

14:15.291 --> 14:17.542
Oh, he's a million

14:15.291 --> 14:17.542
laughs, isn't he?

14:17.583 --> 14:20.583
( harmonica music playing )

14:20.625 --> 14:22.000
Nice, huh?

14:22.041 --> 14:23.667
I made it out of scrap.

14:23.709 --> 14:25.667
( computer beeping )

14:25.709 --> 14:27.542
Guys. It's Don!

14:27.583 --> 14:29.458
His car crashed

14:27.583 --> 14:29.458
into a crane at City Hall.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.667
Is he all right?

14:30.709 --> 14:32.625
I think so, but he's

14:30.709 --> 14:32.625
trapped in his car.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.083
Let's roll, team.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.291
BLURR:

14:34.125 --> 14:35.291
We're coming too.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.500
You're not ready.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.083
This isn't

14:36.542 --> 14:38.083
rocket science.

14:38.125 --> 14:40.208
It's one human

14:38.125 --> 14:40.208
stuck under a crane.

14:40.250 --> 14:41.417
We won't get

14:40.250 --> 14:41.417
in the way.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.959
And it would be

14:41.458 --> 14:42.959
great experience.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.500
It is against

14:43.000 --> 14:44.500
normal protocol

14:44.542 --> 14:46.250
for a Rescue Team

14:44.542 --> 14:46.250
to refuse help.

14:46.291 --> 14:47.542
( grumbles )

14:47.583 --> 14:50.000
Rescue Bots, and others,

14:50.041 --> 14:51.542
roll to the rescue!

14:51.583 --> 14:53.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:07.500 --> 15:08.709
Blurr. Wait!

15:08.750 --> 15:10.417
Wait? Have you met me?

15:13.625 --> 15:15.250
( grunts )

15:15.291 --> 15:17.250
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

15:17.291 --> 15:19.291
( rumbling )

15:20.291 --> 15:21.625
Well, you don't

15:20.291 --> 15:21.625
have to all

15:21.667 --> 15:23.500
congratulate me at once.

15:29.291 --> 15:31.583
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

15:35.792 --> 15:39.291
( all grunting )

15:41.166 --> 15:43.041
CHIEF:

15:41.166 --> 15:43.041
Don't worry,

15:41.166 --> 15:43.041
Don. We have you.

15:43.083 --> 15:45.542
Hurry! They can't hold

15:43.083 --> 15:45.542
that thing forever!

15:45.583 --> 15:47.250
Let's get you

15:45.583 --> 15:47.250
to Dr. McSwain's.

15:47.291 --> 15:48.542
Can you walk?

15:48.583 --> 15:50.709
Lesson one through 30

15:48.583 --> 15:50.709
in rescuing?

15:50.750 --> 15:53.083
Don't leave

15:50.750 --> 15:53.083
the human in danger!

15:53.125 --> 15:55.000
Now get this car

15:53.125 --> 15:55.000
out of the way!

15:55.041 --> 15:56.625
Give a Bot

15:55.041 --> 15:56.625
a nano-cycle, will ya?

15:56.667 --> 15:59.083
( all grunting )

15:59.125 --> 16:00.583
Now get over here and help!

16:00.625 --> 16:03.583
The guy's safe. The car's out.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.583
Just let it drop.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.250
CHASE:

16:03.625 --> 16:06.250
The crane would then land

16:03.625 --> 16:06.250
directly on City Hall!

16:06.291 --> 16:08.417
HEATWAVE:

16:06.291 --> 16:08.417
Blurr, I said now!

16:08.458 --> 16:10.125
All right,

16:08.458 --> 16:10.125
all right.

16:10.542 --> 16:13.458
( all grunting )

16:13.500 --> 16:15.041
We're too low.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.375
We need a better angle.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.375
More leverage.

16:17.417 --> 16:18.625
( all grunting )

16:20.208 --> 16:21.375
I have an idea.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.417
But I have to

16:21.417 --> 16:23.417
let go.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.291
Go for it.

16:38.417 --> 16:40.458
Cody, turn on

16:38.417 --> 16:40.458
that generator.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.667
Will do.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.375
Graham, give me a hand?

16:48.583 --> 16:51.417
If I'm crushed because of your

16:48.583 --> 16:51.417
recklessness, Blurr...

16:51.458 --> 16:54.500
I'm gonna be

16:51.458 --> 16:54.500
very, very angry.

16:54.542 --> 16:56.750
Really? Won't you be

16:54.542 --> 16:56.750
busy being crushed?

16:56.792 --> 16:58.750
( humming )

16:58.792 --> 17:00.750
(  dramatic theme playing  )

17:00.792 --> 17:02.417
BOULDER:

17:00.792 --> 17:02.417
What the...?

17:04.417 --> 17:06.375
Whoa...he just built

17:06.417 --> 17:08.834
a unidirectional

17:06.417 --> 17:08.834
dynamic electromagnet.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.667
Out of junk!

17:10.709 --> 17:11.875
There's no such thing

17:10.709 --> 17:11.875
as junk.

17:11.917 --> 17:13.291
Right, Salvage?

17:14.250 --> 17:16.250
(  mellow theme playing  )

17:17.917 --> 17:19.375
Well, that's it.

17:19.417 --> 17:20.875
Didn't think

17:19.417 --> 17:20.875
I'd be saying it,

17:20.917 --> 17:22.709
but this rescue

17:20.917 --> 17:22.709
goes to you.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.542
Gotta agree with

17:22.750 --> 17:24.542
Cap on that one.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.208
Couldn't have done it

17:24.583 --> 17:26.208
without you, buddy.

17:26.250 --> 17:27.417
Done what?

17:27.458 --> 17:28.792
Put humans in danger?

17:28.834 --> 17:31.166
You were doing that

17:28.834 --> 17:31.166
just fine on your own.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.792
What were you

17:31.208 --> 17:32.792
thinking?

17:32.834 --> 17:35.291
You abandoned that driver

17:32.834 --> 17:35.291
to save yourself.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.625
I for one was shocked.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.500
And remain so.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.083
I don't understand.

17:40.125 --> 17:41.375
How could you risk

17:40.125 --> 17:41.375
your life

17:41.417 --> 17:43.375
saving those cave people,

17:41.417 --> 17:43.375
but now--

17:43.417 --> 17:46.125
Because that was huge,

17:43.417 --> 17:46.125
those were meteors!

17:46.166 --> 17:48.417
This is,

17:46.166 --> 17:48.417
uh, bad driving.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.291
And yeah,

17:48.458 --> 17:50.291
I did risk my life.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.834
And I got every single one

17:50.333 --> 17:52.834
of them off that island.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.750
All by myself.

17:54.792 --> 17:58.208
OPTIMUS:

17:54.792 --> 17:58.208
Blurr, you know

17:54.792 --> 17:58.208
that is not the truth.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.208
Doctor Greene

17:58.250 --> 18:00.208
was able to repair

18:00.250 --> 18:02.250
your ship's Memory Core.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.125
We discovered

18:02.291 --> 18:05.125
some troubling footage.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.458
( beeps )

18:07.166 --> 18:09.542
Your ship was damaged

18:07.166 --> 18:09.542
in a meteor storm

18:09.583 --> 18:12.458
and landed on Wayward Island,

18:09.583 --> 18:12.458
as you said.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.417
But it was Salvage

18:12.500 --> 18:14.417
who decided

18:14.458 --> 18:16.417
to save the inhabitants.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.583
I remember now.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.625
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:26.250 --> 18:27.792
SALVAGE:

18:26.250 --> 18:27.792
You wanted to stay

18:26.250 --> 18:27.792
with the ship,

18:27.834 --> 18:29.458
but we couldn't.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.667
I couldn't leave

18:29.500 --> 18:32.667
those cave people behind.

18:32.709 --> 18:34.291
You said

18:32.709 --> 18:34.291
you'd help me build

18:34.333 --> 18:35.834
a raft to get them

18:34.333 --> 18:35.834
off the island.

18:35.875 --> 18:38.375
But one person

18:35.875 --> 18:38.375
went missing.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.208
And you said

18:38.417 --> 18:40.208
you'd find him.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.750
You promised me.

18:42.792 --> 18:45.625
But you didn't come back.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.542
I waited,

18:45.667 --> 18:48.542
and you didn't come.

18:51.959 --> 18:55.792
So I sent them off,

18:51.959 --> 18:55.792
went looking for you.

18:55.834 --> 18:59.250
Thought you might be

18:55.834 --> 18:59.250
in trouble.

18:59.291 --> 19:00.834
I found the missing caveman.

19:00.875 --> 19:02.834
But you were

19:00.875 --> 19:02.834
nowhere around.

19:08.542 --> 19:10.500
I gave him an amulet,

19:08.542 --> 19:10.500
to protect him.

19:10.542 --> 19:11.750
And then...

19:13.542 --> 19:16.834
OPTIMUS:

19:13.542 --> 19:16.834
This is the security footage

19:13.542 --> 19:16.834
from the ship's bridge.

19:16.875 --> 19:19.667
Come on, come on!

19:16.875 --> 19:19.667
Get me off this rock!

19:19.709 --> 19:21.250
Blurr?

19:21.291 --> 19:22.458
What are you doing?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.417
Salvage!

19:22.500 --> 19:24.417
Uh...you're back.

19:24.458 --> 19:27.000
You were,

19:24.458 --> 19:27.000
leaving without me?

19:27.041 --> 19:28.875
Sorry. You were slow,

19:28.917 --> 19:30.667
and I-- I didn't think

19:28.917 --> 19:30.667
you'd make it.

19:30.709 --> 19:31.875
( growls )

19:31.917 --> 19:34.208
Hey, Salvage, Buddy,

19:31.917 --> 19:34.208
come on.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.500
SALVAGE:

19:34.250 --> 19:35.500
We fought.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.291
It scared Ira.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.291
He ran off.

19:38.333 --> 19:41.250
Then the meteors

19:38.333 --> 19:41.250
started hitting the cave.

19:41.291 --> 19:42.917
All we could do

19:41.291 --> 19:42.917
was go back into stasis,

19:42.959 --> 19:44.834
and hope for the best.

19:44.875 --> 19:47.500
That's what happened.

19:47.542 --> 19:49.709
You can't run away

19:47.542 --> 19:49.709
from this one.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.542
Look, I never said--

19:51.583 --> 19:54.542
Well, all right, yes,

19:51.583 --> 19:54.542
I did, but--

19:54.583 --> 19:56.959
( sighs )

19:57.000 --> 19:58.375
You got me, Cap.

19:58.417 --> 20:01.041
I know we were

19:58.417 --> 20:01.041
never really a team.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.041
You did your job,

20:01.083 --> 20:03.041
I did mine.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.000
But even so...

20:05.041 --> 20:06.458
( sighs )

20:06.500 --> 20:10.041
Salvage, I'm sorry.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.041
Really.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.917
Oh yeah.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.917
I believe that.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.875
OPTIMUS:

20:14.667 --> 20:16.875
After some careful

20:14.667 --> 20:16.875
consideration,

20:16.917 --> 20:20.583
I believe we should

20:16.917 --> 20:20.583
not give up on Blurr.

20:20.625 --> 20:24.458
But, sir, you saw.

20:20.625 --> 20:24.458
He ran out on his partner.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.709
Those humans.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.375
He lied to us!

20:27.417 --> 20:29.750
The rogue does not even care

20:27.417 --> 20:29.750
about trying to fit in.

20:29.792 --> 20:31.583
If he really didn't care,

20:31.625 --> 20:32.917
he wouldn't bother lying.

20:32.959 --> 20:34.417
Wait, you're defending him?

20:34.458 --> 20:37.417
Heatwave, maybe

20:34.458 --> 20:37.417
Blurr just needs more time.

20:37.458 --> 20:38.792
Like Salvage says,

20:38.834 --> 20:41.667
sooner or later,

20:38.834 --> 20:41.667
everything finds its purpose.

20:41.709 --> 20:44.542
Hm. I did say that,

20:41.709 --> 20:44.542
didn't I?

20:44.583 --> 20:46.750
I agree, Cody Burns.

20:46.792 --> 20:48.917
I have watched

20:46.792 --> 20:48.917
too many Cybertronians

20:48.959 --> 20:51.792
take the easy path

20:48.959 --> 20:51.792
over the right one.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.875
I would like to help Blurr

20:51.834 --> 20:54.875
make the correct choice.

20:54.917 --> 20:56.792
And I still

20:54.917 --> 20:56.792
believe you are

20:56.834 --> 20:58.792
the one to help him,

20:56.834 --> 20:58.792
Heatwave.

20:58.834 --> 21:01.500
I have faith

20:58.834 --> 21:01.500
in both of you.

21:01.542 --> 21:04.917
But sir, I don't--

21:01.542 --> 21:04.917
I mean--

21:04.959 --> 21:06.792
( sighs )

21:06.834 --> 21:08.792
I'll try not

21:06.834 --> 21:08.792
to let you down, Sir.

21:08.834 --> 21:14.000
(  slow theme playing  )

21:14.041 --> 21:16.500
Looks like you get

21:14.041 --> 21:16.500
another chance, Hot Shot.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.333
Not that I think

21:16.542 --> 21:18.333
you deserve it.

21:18.375 --> 21:21.125
He'll do great.

21:18.375 --> 21:21.125
I know he will. Right, Blurr?

21:21.166 --> 21:23.542
Glad you think so, Cody.

21:24.667 --> 21:28.542
Me too, kid. Thanks.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.583
( playing harmonica )

21:32.709 --> 21:34.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )
