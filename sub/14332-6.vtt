A NOTCH.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.850
I'LL USE YOUR MAGIC
TO MAKE TIMMY TURNER'S LIFE

08:37.917 --> 08:41.419
AND THE LIVES OF KIDS EVERYWHERE
PURE MISERY.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.489
[cackles]

08:43.556 --> 08:45.391
[both laugh]

08:45.458 --> 08:50.630
DON'T LAUGH EVILLY
UNTIL I TELL YOU TO!

08:50.696 --> 08:53.299
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA
WITH SOME BAD NEWS FOR KIDS.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.834
WEEKENDS AND SUMMER VACATIONS

08:54.901 --> 08:56.335
HAVE BEEN MAGICALLY CANCELLED.

08:56.402 --> 08:59.171
ALSO, ALL KIDS MUST PRACTICE
THE TUBA FOUR HOURS A DAY

08:59.238 --> 09:01.274
OR FOUR TUBAS
FOR ONE HOUR A DAY.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.476
- OH, COME ON.
THIS CAN'T BE REAL.

09:03.542 --> 09:04.944
- THIS IS TOTALLY REAL.

09:05.011 --> 09:06.646
AND IF YOU DON'T PRACTICE,
YOU WILL BE ATTACKED

09:06.712 --> 09:09.248
BY A VICIOUS BEAST CALLED
"THE TUBA-CABRA"

09:09.315 --> 09:11.784
AS SEEN HERE IN THIS PICTURE
FROM TIMMY TURNER'S ROOM.

09:11.851 --> 09:12.952
- WAIT, WHAT?

09:13.019 --> 09:14.887
- [growls]
[all scream]

09:14.954 --> 09:16.289
[brassy yelling]
[screams]

09:16.355 --> 09:19.325
- AH! POOF IT AWAY!
POOF IT AWAY!

09:19.392 --> 09:22.595
- [brassy yelling]

09:22.662 --> 09:24.964
- GUYS, WHAT THE HECK
IS HAPPENING?

09:25.031 --> 09:27.333
- WELL, EITHER A STAMPEDE
OF ELEPHANTS

09:27.400 --> 09:28.467
IS ABOUT TO CRUSH US,

09:28.534 --> 09:29.769
OR EVERY KID
IN DIMMSDALE

09:29.835 --> 09:31.203
IS PRACTICING
THE TUBA.

09:31.270 --> 09:35.574
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

09:35.641 --> 09:38.144
- OH!
- I CAN'T PLAY THE TUBA ANYMORE.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.212
MY LIPS HURT.
AH!

09:40.279 --> 09:41.948
NOT AS MUCH
AS TUBA-CABRA CLAWS.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.082
AHH!

09:43.149 --> 09:45.151
- ANYWAY, TIMMY,
IT'S SATURDAY.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.954
YOU SHOULD BE
IN SCHOOL.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.523
- OH, I AM NOT GOING TO SCHOOL
ON SATURDAY.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.858
WHATEVER'S GOING ON HERE,
MAKE IT STOP!

09:52.925 --> 09:56.495
I WANT YOU
TO POOF IT ALL AWAY!

09:56.562 --> 09:59.665
[exasperated tuba playing]

09:59.732 --> 10:00.666
all: YAY!

10:00.733 --> 10:01.934
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA SAYING

10:02.001 --> 10:03.970
FORGET EVERYTHING
I JUST SAID.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.072
KIDS CAN GO
HAVE FUN AGAIN.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.139
- WHAT HAPPENED?

10:07.206 --> 10:08.407
ALL MY EVIL WISHES
WENT AWAY!

10:08.474 --> 10:09.875
- HAVE THEY?

10:09.942 --> 10:11.711
I CAN'T SEE A THING WITH
THIS STUPID HAIR IN MY EYES.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.145
[laughs nervously]

10:13.212 --> 10:15.781
STUPID HAIR THAT I'M VERY,
VERY GRATEFUL FOR.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.450
DON'T HURT ME.
- ALL RIGHT.

10:17.516 --> 10:18.784
LET'S DO THIS AGAIN.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.653
I WISH ALL KIDS
IN DIMMSDALE

10:20.720 --> 10:23.889
WERE STUFFED
IN LOCKERS.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.892
- [giggles]

10:29.996 --> 10:32.365
- GUYS, GET ME OUTTA HERE!

10:32.431 --> 10:33.833
- NORMALLY, WEIRD THINGS
ONLY HAPPEN

10:33.899 --> 10:35.134
WHEN I WISH FOR THEM.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.736
WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND HERE?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.004
- YOU'RE ASKING ME?

10:38.070 --> 10:39.438
I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

10:39.505 --> 10:42.208
HOW HOT MEAT DISHES
KEEP SHOWING UP IN MY POCKET.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.076
- THE ONLY THING
I CAN THINK OF

10:44.143 --> 10:47.279
IS SOMEBODY ELSE IS OUT THERE
MAKING WISHES.

10:47.346 --> 10:49.081
REALLY MEAN WISHES.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.350
AND APPARENTLY,
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY KID

10:51.417 --> 10:52.985
WHO WAS STUFFED
IN A LOCKER.

10:53.052 --> 10:55.921
[screaming]

10:55.988 --> 10:57.056
- OH, NO.

10:57.123 --> 10:59.959
I WISH ALL THE LOCKERS
WERE GONE.

11:02.128 --> 11:06.232
- GUYS, WE'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHO'S BEHIND ALL THIS.

11:06.298 --> 11:09.068
- WHY DO ALL MY WISHES
KEEP BEING UNDONE?

11:09.135 --> 11:10.870
- IF IT PLEASES YOU,
YOUR EVILNESS,

11:10.936 --> 11:12.004
I HAVE A THEORY.

11:12.071 --> 11:14.206
- SPIT IT OUT.
- [spits]

11:14.273 --> 11:16.308
- NOT YOUR GUM,
YOUR THEORY.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.543
AND STUFF YOURSELF
IN A LOCKER

11:17.610 --> 11:21.280
FOR PUTTING GUM
IN MY HAIR.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.149
- THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE
WHO HAS MAGICAL FAIRIES.

11:23.215 --> 11:26.118
AND HE'S PROBABLY USING THEM
TO UNWISH YOUR WISHES.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.187
[groans]
- WHO IS IT?

11:28.254 --> 11:30.456
- IT'S...
[stutters]

11:30.523 --> 11:33.726
TIMMY TURNER,
YOUR PSYCHOTIC-NESS.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.628
- THE TWERP HAS FAIRIES?

11:35.694 --> 11:38.564
SO THAT EXPLAINS THE FUNNY
BUSINESS WITH THE CIRCUS

11:38.631 --> 11:40.866
AND HOW HE WEARS A PINK HAT
WITHOUT GETTING BEAT UP.

11:40.933 --> 11:44.236
SO THE WAY TO DESTROY TIMMY
IS TO DESTROY HIS FAIRIES.

11:44.303 --> 11:47.339
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO!

11:47.406 --> 11:49.942
[both cackle]

11:50.009 --> 11:51.610
DON'T LAUGH EVILLY
UNTIL I TELL YOU TO!

11:51.677 --> 11:52.611
- SORRY.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.485
- SO TELL ME, WEIRDO:

11:59.552 --> 12:01.387
HOW DO I CAPTURE
TIMMY TURNER'S FAIRIES?

12:01.454 --> 12:02.388
[bat squeaks]

12:02.455 --> 12:03.622
- I'M SORRY.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.491
IS THAT A FRUIT BAT
ON YOUR SHOULDER?

12:05.558 --> 12:08.094
- YEAH, FOR SOME REASON,
THEY NEST IN MY ROOM.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.095
- [screams]

12:09.161 --> 12:10.463
GOOD GRIEF.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.031
WHAT ARE YOU?

12:12.098 --> 12:13.799
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

12:13.866 --> 12:16.168
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE MOMENT?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.503
[screams]

12:17.570 --> 12:18.537
OH, RIGHT.

12:18.604 --> 12:19.672
I CAN'T DEFY YOU

12:19.738 --> 12:22.007
WITHOUT BEING ZAPPED
BY MY BABA.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.342
- STOP MESSING AROUND

12:23.409 --> 12:25.311
AND TELL ME HOW TO CATCH
THE TWERP'S FAIRIES.

12:25.377 --> 12:26.579
- TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

12:26.645 --> 12:28.714
CATCHING FAIRIES
IS NOT MY SPECIALTY.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.950
BUT I DO KNOW AN EXPERT.

12:31.016 --> 12:32.952
[doorbell rings]

12:33.018 --> 12:34.086
- COME ON IN.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.588
I WAS JUST POURING
SOME LEMONADE.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.723
NOT FOR THE DOLLS, THOUGH.
THAT WOULD BE CREEPY.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.592
SO WHAT CAN
I DO YOU FOR?

12:39.658 --> 12:40.793
- WE NEED YOU
TO TELL US

12:40.860 --> 12:42.795
HOW TO CATCH
TIMMY TURNER'S FAIRIES.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.131
- FAIRIES?
WELL, I'M AN EXPERT IN THAT.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.432
IF YOU'VE DEFINE "EXPERT"
AS SOMEONE

12:46.499 --> 12:47.633
WHO'S NEVER ACCOMPLISHED
THE ONE THING

12:47.700 --> 12:49.368
HE SET OUT TO DO.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.903
- SAVE ME.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.538
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

12:52.605 --> 12:54.607
- UM, I MEANT SAVE ME
A GLASS OF LEMONADE.

12:54.673 --> 12:55.875
[laughs nervously]

12:55.941 --> 12:57.743
UH, THE FRUIT BAT DIPPED
ITS TALONS IN MINE.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.011
AFTER ALL,
LEMONS ARE A FRUIT.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.346
AND HE IS A FRUIT BAT.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.748
IT STANDS TO REASON.
[cries]

13:02.815 --> 13:05.618
I WANT TO GO HOME!
[groans]

13:05.684 --> 13:07.820
- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO HELP US CATCH FAIRIES?

13:07.887 --> 13:10.656
- DO I?
[beep]

13:10.723 --> 13:12.057
[both scream]

13:12.124 --> 13:13.692
- THOSE ARE
BUTTERFLY NETS.

13:13.759 --> 13:16.762
NO FAIRY OR DERANGED LUNATIC
CAN ESCAPE THEM.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.430
AND THAT'S
THE CROCKER POT.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.099
NOT ONLY DOES
IT CATCH FAIRIES

13:20.166 --> 13:21.934
BUT IT ALSO MAKES
A GREAT RUMP ROAST,

13:22.001 --> 13:24.503
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE ONE FOOD
FAIRIES CAN'T RESIST.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.172
- [laughs]
PERFECT.

13:26.238 --> 13:28.574
I'LL TAKE THE RUMP ROAST
AND THE CROCKER POT.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.009
- WHOA, WHOA!

13:30.075 --> 13:31.510
IF YOU'RE GOING
FAIRY HUNTING,

13:31.577 --> 13:32.778
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.747
- YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

13:34.813 --> 13:39.185
STUFF HIM
IN A LOCKER.

13:39.251 --> 13:41.453
- OH, THE DOWNSIDE
OF HAVING DOLLS FOR FRIENDS

13:41.520 --> 13:42.688
IS THEY CAN'T
PICK A LOCK.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.190
I MEAN,
THEY'RE NOT MINE!

13:44.256 --> 13:45.958
[electronic beeping]

13:46.025 --> 13:48.627
- ANY LUCK LOCATING THE SOURCE
OF THE EVIL MAGIC?

13:48.694 --> 13:50.029
- I HAVEN'T FOUND
ANY MAGIC.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.964
BUT I DID FIND
THESE POCKET TACOS.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.365
I CALL THEM "PACOS."

13:53.432 --> 13:56.135
- WELL, AT LEAST SPARKY'S
ON THE CASE.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.370
- GOOD NEWS, GUYS.
I FOUND THE CASE.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.906
- THAT'S MY DAD <i> BRIEFCASE.</i>

14:00.973 --> 14:02.875
- LET'S SEE:
THERE'S A YO-YO,

14:02.942 --> 14:05.544
A PADDLE BALL GAME,
AND A SCARY, HAND-SCRAWLED BOOK

14:05.611 --> 14:07.346
CALLED <i> SINK THE DINK:</i>

14:07.413 --> 14:09.248
<i>HOW I PLAN</i>
<i>TO DESTROY DINKELBERG</i>

14:09.315 --> 14:11.083
<i>AND TARNISH HIS LEGACY.</i>

14:11.150 --> 14:12.484
- THAT'S MY DAD'S,
ALL RIGHT.

14:12.551 --> 14:14.053
WHERE IS MY DAD, ANYWAY?

14:14.119 --> 14:16.689
- NORMALLY, I SHARE MY BOX SEATS
TO THE BASEBALL GAME

14:16.755 --> 14:18.324
WITH AN UNDERPRIVILEGED CHILD.

14:18.390 --> 14:19.858
BUT SINCE
WE'RE HANDCUFFED TOGETHER,

14:19.925 --> 14:21.727
I GUESS
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.295
- SOME LUCKY DAY.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.897
GREAT SEATS,
FREE HOT DOGS,

14:24.964 --> 14:27.066
AND I GOT TO THROW OUT
THE FIRST PITCH.

14:27.132 --> 14:29.301
SOMEBODY WAKE ME
FROM THIS HIDEOUS DREAM!

14:29.368 --> 14:32.171
[bat hits ball]

14:32.238 --> 14:33.806
OH, GREAT!

14:33.872 --> 14:36.075
NOW, I'VE CAUGHT
A RECORD-BREAKING HOME RUN BALL

14:36.141 --> 14:37.409
WORTH THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS.

14:37.476 --> 14:41.013
YOU DESPICABLE FIEND!

14:41.080 --> 14:44.650
- SPORT, I'VE LOCATED THE SOURCE
OF THE EVIL MAGIC.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.552
IT'S...

14:46.619 --> 14:48.354
[sniffs]

14:48.420 --> 14:51.056
WHAT IS
THAT DELICIOUS SMELL?

14:51.123 --> 14:52.358
- BURNT PACOS?

14:52.424 --> 14:54.560
NO, WAIT.
IT'S RUMP ROAST.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.428
NO FAIRY CAN RESIST IT.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.264
OOH.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.300
all: RUMP ROAST.
RUMP ROAST.

15:01.367 --> 15:04.303
RUMP ROAST.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.405
- SOON, I'LL CAPTURE
THE TWERP'S FAIRIES.

15:06.472 --> 15:09.308
AND NO ONE WILL BE ABLE
TO UNDO MY EVIL WISHES!

15:09.375 --> 15:10.676
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

15:10.743 --> 15:12.611
WHY ISN'T THE RUMP ROAST THING
WORKING ON YOU?

15:12.678 --> 15:14.546
- BECAUSE I'M AN ANTI-FAIRY.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.115
OUR WEAKNESS
ISN'T RUMP ROAST.

15:16.181 --> 15:17.416
IT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE,

15:17.483 --> 15:19.618
WHICH EVERYONE KNOWS
IS CHICKEN CORDON BLEU.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.921
all: RUMP ROAST.
RUMP ROAST.

15:22.988 --> 15:26.025
RUMP ROAST.
- HA! WE DID IT!

15:26.091 --> 15:28.127
WE CAPTURED
THE TWERP'S FAIRIES!

15:28.193 --> 15:30.229
- NO!

15:30.296 --> 15:32.498
VICKY CAUGHT COSMO,
WANDA, AND POOF.

15:32.564 --> 15:34.800
WAIT, HOW COME THE RUMP ROAST
DIDN'T WORK ON YOU?

15:34.867 --> 15:36.268
- I'M A FAIRY DOG.

15:36.335 --> 15:38.604
EVERYONE KNOWS OUR WEAKNESS
IS LOBSTER BISQUE.

15:38.671 --> 15:39.905
- NO ONE KNOWS THAT!

15:39.972 --> 15:42.641
ANYWAY, HOW DID VICKY FIND OUT
I HAVE FAIRIES?

15:42.708 --> 15:46.312
- BECAUSE I, THE GREAT
AND POWERFUL FOOP, TOLD HER.

15:46.378 --> 15:47.780
PLEASE SAVE ME
FROM HER.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.248
- YOU'RE THROUGH, TWERP.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.650
I WANT ALL
MY WISHES REINSTATED.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.719
BUT INSTEAD OF PUTTING
THE TWERP IN A LOCKER,

15:53.786 --> 15:55.087
PUT HIM
IN A BALLET CLASS

15:55.154 --> 15:58.090
TAUGHT BY AN ANGRY MONKEY
WITH A TASER!

16:00.592 --> 16:05.097
- [shouts nervously]

16:05.164 --> 16:07.633
- [sighs]
MUSIC TO MY EARS.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.102
CHILDREN IN LOCKERS
PRACTICING THE TUBA.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.937
COME ON, SCARY GODPARENT.

16:12.004 --> 16:16.442
I'VE GOT SOME MORE MISERY
TO CAUSE.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.178
- UH-OH.
IT'S UP TO ME TO SAVE EVERYONE.

16:19.244 --> 16:22.448
FIRST, I GOTTA GET SIX TAPS
ON THIS PADDLE BALL GAME.

16:22.514 --> 16:25.751
ONE, TWO.
OKAY, THIS MAY TAKE A WHILE.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.791
- CAN I PLEASE STOP NOW?

16:32.858 --> 16:36.762
- NO. PLIE!
- [screams]

16:36.829 --> 16:40.132
- FREEZE, DANCE MONKEY.
- [screams]

16:40.199 --> 16:42.701
[groans]
- [yells]

16:42.768 --> 16:45.871
[groans]

16:45.938 --> 16:47.106
- ONE.
TWO.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.743
THREE, FOUR.
- [groans]

16:50.809 --> 16:52.678
- DARN IT.
I CAN NEVER GET TO SIX.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.247
- I'M OKAY.
AHH!

16:55.314 --> 16:56.548
NO, NOT OKAY.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.817
IRONICALLY, I SLIPPED
ON A BANANA PEEL.

16:58.884 --> 17:00.085
- COME ON, SPARKY.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.955
WE GOTTA GO SAVE MY FAIRIES
AND STOP VICKY.

17:03.021 --> 17:04.189
BEFORE WE DO THAT,

17:04.256 --> 17:05.457
CAN YOU TAKE OFF
THE TUTU?

17:05.523 --> 17:06.558
IT'S UNSETTLING.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.460
- [groans]

17:08.527 --> 17:09.962
- HELP! LET US OUT!

17:10.028 --> 17:12.631
- HELP! WANDA JUST YELLED "HELP"
IN MY EAR.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.999
- QUIET!

17:14.066 --> 17:16.602
I'M GONNA SET THIS CROCKER POT
TO VAPORIZE.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.270
IN TEN MINUTES,
THE TWERP'S FAIRIES

17:18.337 --> 17:20.305
WILL BE AS COOKED
AS THAT RUMP ROAST.

17:20.372 --> 17:24.376
[cackles]

17:24.443 --> 17:25.877
ALL RIGHT, WEIRDO.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.646
TIME TO RAMP UP
THE EVIL.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.848
I WISH ICE CREAM TASTED
LIKE SARDINES.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.884
I WISH ALL BIRTHDAY PARTIES
WERE CANCELLED.

17:31.950 --> 17:34.486
AND FINALLY, I WISH
THERE REALLY WERE MONSTERS

17:34.553 --> 17:36.388
UNDER EVERY KID'S BED!

17:36.455 --> 17:38.957
- BOY, YOU HAVE ISSUES.

17:39.024 --> 17:40.359
- JUST DO IT!

17:43.562 --> 17:45.831
- [groans]
- AHH!

17:45.898 --> 17:48.767
- [shrieks]
- AHH!

17:48.834 --> 17:50.135
both: AHH!

17:50.202 --> 17:53.005
- I WISH YOU WERE WEARING
A SANDPAPER DIAPER.

17:55.374 --> 17:56.975
- [cries]

17:57.042 --> 17:59.211
SO THIS IS
HOW IT ENDS?

17:59.278 --> 18:02.247
WEARING A SCRATCHY DIAPER
IN A ROOM FULL OF BATS.

18:02.314 --> 18:05.417
[cries]
CRY, CRY, WEEPING SOUNDS.

18:05.484 --> 18:06.919
[weeps]

18:06.985 --> 18:08.053
- [sniffs]

18:08.120 --> 18:10.289
SOMETHING SMELLS
REALLY GOOD, TIMMY.

18:10.355 --> 18:11.657
- THAT'S MY FAIRIES.

18:11.723 --> 18:13.459
WE'VE GOT TO GET THEM
OUT OF THAT CROCKER POT

18:13.525 --> 18:15.160
BEFORE THEIR RUMPS
ARE ROASTED.

18:15.227 --> 18:16.929
BUT HOW?
- I GOT IT.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.531
- WHAT?
- I DID SIX!

18:19.598 --> 18:21.533
- SPARKY, FOCUS!

18:21.600 --> 18:22.968
IF WE DON'T GET THEM OUT
IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES,

18:23.035 --> 18:23.969
THEY'RE COOKED.

18:24.036 --> 18:25.037
COME ON!

18:25.103 --> 18:26.271
- [brassy growling]

18:26.338 --> 18:28.707
- OH, NO.
I HAVE TO PRACTICE MY TUBA.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.710
- [growls]

18:33.846 --> 18:36.949
[growls]

18:37.015 --> 18:39.618
- WE'VE GOTTA GET IN THERE
AND TAKE OUT VICKY.

18:39.685 --> 18:40.886
- WE CAN'T, TIMMY.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.888
VICKY WILL USE FOOP
TO DESTROY US.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.389
- NOT IF WE CAN
CONVINCE FOOP

18:44.456 --> 18:45.757
TO TURN ON HER FIRST.

18:45.824 --> 18:47.759
HE'S SPENT A LOT OF TIME
WITH VICKY.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.862
HE MUST BE READY TO CRACK
BY NOW.

18:49.928 --> 18:51.163
- [growls]

18:51.230 --> 18:52.164
[mutters indistinctly]

18:52.231 --> 18:53.599
- COME ON, SPARKY.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.100
HOLD IT, VICKY.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.268
- [growls]

18:56.335 --> 18:58.971
- AHH!
- [growls]

18:59.037 --> 19:01.006
- TWERP, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

19:01.073 --> 19:02.474
CALL OFF YOUR DOG.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.310
NEVERMIND, I'LL HAVE
MY SCARY GODPARENT DO IT.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.513
FOOP, DESTROY THEM!

19:07.579 --> 19:09.314
- CAN I TAKE OFF
THE DIAPER?

19:09.381 --> 19:10.649
- NO!
- [shouts nervously]

19:10.716 --> 19:12.150
- FOOP, WAIT.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.653
IF YOU HELP US STOP VICKY
AND LET ME SAVE MY FAIRIES,

19:14.720 --> 19:16.355
I'LL HELP YOU
GET AWAY FROM HER.

19:16.421 --> 19:17.856
- I CAN'T DEFY VICKY.

19:17.923 --> 19:20.359
IF I DO,
MY BABA GIVES ME AN OWIE.

19:20.425 --> 19:22.394
- USE BIG-BOY WORDS.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.129
I'LL GET MY FAIRIES
TO BLAST YOUR BABA

19:24.196 --> 19:25.631
SO YOU CAN BE FREE
OF VICKY.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.766
- REALLY?
CAN I ALSO GET A SNACK?

19:27.833 --> 19:30.536
SHE THREW OUT MY LITTLE BAG
OF FISHY CRACKER NUM-NUMS.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.037
- DON'T LISTEN
TO HIM, FOOP.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.772
YOU'RE <i> MY</i> SCARY GODPARENT.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.440
AND YOU'LL DO
AS <i> I</i> SAY.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.376
AND I SAY SUFFER!

19:37.442 --> 19:40.546
- MMM.
SOMETHING SMELLS DELICIOUS.

19:40.612 --> 19:42.147
- THAT'S US, COSMO.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.449
- FOOP, YOU GOTTA LISTEN
TO ME.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.485
VICKY'S GONNA
KEEP TREATING YOU BADLY.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.054
IF YOU DON'T WANNA WIND UP
IN THAT CROCKER POT SOMEDAY,

19:49.121 --> 19:52.658
BLAST HER NOW, AND LET ME SAVE
WANDA, COSMO, AND POOF.

19:52.724 --> 19:54.092
- FORGET IT, TIMMY.

19:54.159 --> 19:56.395
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
TO CHANGE MY MIND.

19:56.461 --> 19:59.598
- WHAT IF I THROW IN
SOME CHICKEN CORDON BLEU?

19:59.665 --> 20:02.267
- MIND CHANGED.
PERISH, EVIL SHREW!

20:02.334 --> 20:04.169
[screams]
- HA, HA!

20:04.236 --> 20:05.537
YOU CAN'T DO IT.

20:05.604 --> 20:09.074
YOU'RE WORTHLESS.
AND YOU'RE MINE FOREVER!

20:09.141 --> 20:11.777
- WANNA BET,
BAT LADY?

20:11.843 --> 20:13.745
- [screams]

20:13.812 --> 20:15.447
- [screams]

20:15.514 --> 20:17.849
[sighs]

20:17.916 --> 20:19.851
all: YAY!

20:19.918 --> 20:23.021
- THANKS, SPORT.
OUR GOOSE WAS ALMOST COOKED.

20:23.088 --> 20:24.756
- ACTUALLY, IT WAS
FULLY COOKED.

20:24.823 --> 20:27.025
I HAD A GOOSE
IN MY MAGIC MEAT POCKET.

20:27.092 --> 20:28.694
- [honks]
- [yelps]

20:28.760 --> 20:30.662
- THANKS FOR SAVING
MY FAIRIES, FOOP.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.765
- THANK YOU FOR SAVING
MY BEHIND, LITERALLY.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.868
- GUYS, I WANT YOU TO GIVE FOOP
A CHICKEN CORDON BLEU,

20:36.935 --> 20:39.638
A NEW BABA,
AND AN OWIE-FREE DIAPER.

20:39.705 --> 20:44.076
- TIMMY, USE YOUR BIG-BOY WORDS.

20:44.142 --> 20:46.478
- THANK YOU.
BUT CAN I GET AN APPLE JUICE?

20:46.545 --> 20:48.513
GRAPE JUICE DOESN'T GO WELL
WITH CHICKEN.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.549
BUNCH OF TACKY MORONS.

20:50.616 --> 20:55.020
- GUYS, WE NEED TO UNDO
ALL OF VICKY'S EVIL WISHES.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.091
all: YAY!
- AHH!

20:59.157 --> 21:00.392
[groans]

21:00.459 --> 21:01.526
- [growls]

21:01.593 --> 21:03.528
- YAY!
I'M TRAUMATIZED.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.566
- YOU KNOW, TURNER,
I WAS GONNA TAKE MY WIFE

21:07.633 --> 21:09.468
ON THIS FIRST-CLASS
CARIBBEAN CRUISE.

21:09.534 --> 21:11.069
BUT SINCE WE'RE
HANDCUFFED TOGETHER,

21:11.136 --> 21:12.404
IT'S YOUR LUCKY WEEK.

21:12.471 --> 21:15.307
- HOW DARE YOU SHOWER ME
WITH LUXURY!

21:15.374 --> 21:17.576
I HOPE YOU ROT FOR THIS.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.911
- WELL, LOOK AT THAT.
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

21:19.978 --> 21:22.047
- OH, RIGHT,
AND FORGO THE NACHOS

21:22.114 --> 21:23.382
I JUST PUT ON YOUR TAB?

21:23.448 --> 21:26.151
THAT WOULD PLAY RIGHT
INTO YOUR GRIMY HAND.

21:26.218 --> 21:28.053
SPEAKING OF YOUR GRIMY HAND,
WOULD YOU MIND

21:28.120 --> 21:29.621
RUBBING SOME SUN BLOCK
ON MY BACK?

21:29.688 --> 21:31.556
- SURE, PAL.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.624
- THIS IS THE LIFE.

21:32.691 --> 21:34.826
I MEAN,
CURSE YOU, DINKELBERG!

21:34.893 --> 21:38.063
- FOOP, YOU HAVE
FAILED MISERABLY

21:38.130 --> 21:39.798
AS A SCARY GODPARENT.

21:39.865 --> 21:43.068
- IT APPEARS YOU ARE NOT AS EVIL
AS WE HAD HOPED.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.703
- OH, REALLY?

21:44.770 --> 21:48.907
I'LL SHOW <i> YOU</i> EVIL.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.076
- WHY DOES THIS HURT
SO MUCH?

21:51.143 --> 21:54.146
- BECAUSE YOU'RE WEARING
SANDPAPER DIAPERS!

21:54.212 --> 21:56.148
[laughs]

21:56.214 --> 21:58.216
OH, I'M BACK, BABY!

21:59.551 --> 22:01.153
- IT'S GOOD
TO BE HOME, GUYS.

22:01.219 --> 22:02.888
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO GET SOME DINNER?

22:02.954 --> 22:04.322
- NO NEED, TIMMY.

22:04.389 --> 22:07.659
MY MAGIC POCKETS ARE FILLED
WITH MOO GOO GAI PAN.

22:07.726 --> 22:10.729
WHOO, THAT'S A LOT OF GOO
AND NOT MUCH GAI PAN.

22:10.796 --> 22:12.764
- UH, YEAH.
LET'S JUST GO OUT TO EAT.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.833
BY THE WAY,
WHERE DID YOU POOF VICKY?

22:14.900 --> 22:16.334
- OH, DON'T WORRY.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.670
WE'RE KEEPING HER
ON HER TOES.

22:18.737 --> 22:21.039
- THIS SANDPAPER TUTU HURTS!

22:21.106 --> 22:23.375
- JUST KEEP DANCING,
BAT LADY!

22:23.442 --> 22:25.277
- [screams]

22:25.343 --> 22:29.247
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M KEEPING THE HAIR.
