Barry, are you awake?

02:21.749 --> 02:24.125
Honey, just relax.

02:24.293 --> 02:27.128
Doctor says everything's
gonna be just fine.

02:37.598 --> 02:39.265
Until that day,

02:39.433 --> 02:42.602
I couldn't imagine living
for anything other than women.

02:44.938 --> 02:46.378
You see,
there's a moment that exists

02:46.482 --> 02:48.649
at the edge of sexual success

02:48.817 --> 02:50.818
for which there is no equal...

02:50.986 --> 02:54.155
the addictive seconds
just after uncertainty

02:54.323 --> 02:57.283
and immediately preceding
touching the gold.

02:57.451 --> 02:59.577
It's Christmas.

03:04.666 --> 03:06.209
It's with this in mind

03:06.376 --> 03:07.919
that I relate
the events leading to

03:08.086 --> 03:11.255
the involuntary removal
of my testicles.

03:14.885 --> 03:17.136
Yep. Mm-

03:17.304 --> 03:18.805
Yeah. No, that's
gonna be great.

03:18.972 --> 03:20.890
We can do that.

03:27.648 --> 03:29.524
I don't know how you do it, Lucy.

03:29.691 --> 03:30.942
Do what?

03:31.109 --> 03:32.527
Look like a model.

03:32.694 --> 03:34.028
A supermodel, actually.

03:34.196 --> 03:37.031
A super-duper model.

03:37.199 --> 03:38.999
Hey, I don't know what
you got goin' on later,

03:39.166 --> 03:40.886
but I was thinkin'
of hittin' the happy hour

03:40.910 --> 03:42.703
over at Chili's.
Got a workout partner...

03:42.871 --> 03:44.831
I don't date people
at my workplace.

03:44.998 --> 03:47.250
Who said date?
TGIF.

03:47.417 --> 03:49.544
Maybe not...

03:49.711 --> 03:51.170
maybe not Chili's.

03:51.338 --> 03:54.257
Everpea has got
this really rad nacho bar.

03:54.424 --> 03:55.944
Why don't you
date people at your work?

03:56.009 --> 03:57.009
I just don't.

03:57.177 --> 03:59.720
You just...

03:59.888 --> 04:01.389
You're probably right.

04:01.557 --> 04:03.683
You're smart.
It's a smart idea.

04:03.851 --> 04:05.560
You got beauty and brains.

04:05.727 --> 04:09.522
You guys fall in love,
and then have babies.

04:09.690 --> 04:13.651
Beautiful babies with blue eyes.

04:14.695 --> 04:18.531
TGIF.

04:18.699 --> 04:20.199
All right.
What's up, Denise?

04:20.367 --> 04:21.909
- Hey, you don't like nachos?
- Mm-mm.

04:22.077 --> 04:24.078
No no no. I do!

04:49.980 --> 04:51.480
My tires are stinky.

04:51.648 --> 04:53.065
What?

04:53.233 --> 04:55.073
That's a catchphrase,
somethin' I’m workin' on.

04:55.193 --> 04:58.696
- How we lookin'?
- Shit, place is a hatchery. It's stupid.

04:58.864 --> 05:02.074
- I wanna be an architect.
- Whoa, over there.

05:02.242 --> 05:06.078
See it? Dress suit, sneakers.
Work hard, play hard.

05:06.246 --> 05:09.123
I could go back to school, be an architect.
People like architects.

05:09.291 --> 05:10.571
Dude, what
are you talkin' about?

05:10.738 --> 05:12.218
You make really good
money at your job.

05:12.242 --> 05:14.879
I just... I just...

05:15.047 --> 05:17.673
I don't think insurance is,

05:17.841 --> 05:19.425
you know, as a lifestyle.

05:19.593 --> 05:21.093
- Whoa.
- Caught 'em peekin'.

05:21.261 --> 05:22.901
- You ready? Let's rock 'n' roll.
- Sweet.

05:23.055 --> 05:24.722
Hey, so if they ask,
I’m gonna tell 'em I’m an architect.

05:24.890 --> 05:26.390
Hey, tell 'em I work with kids.

05:26.558 --> 05:28.225
Hold these.

05:28.393 --> 05:29.913
No no, seriously,
I used to get beat up

05:30.062 --> 05:32.022
like twice a week
for having such thick eyelashes.

05:32.105 --> 05:34.398
- ls that your card?
- No.

05:34.566 --> 05:36.886
All the way to the seventh grade,
and that's when I decided

05:36.910 --> 05:38.611
that's it, and I went
for my black belt.

05:38.779 --> 05:40.279
ls that your card?

05:40.447 --> 05:41.948
- No.
- No.

05:42.115 --> 05:43.699
- That's so sad.
- Yeah.

05:43.867 --> 05:46.827
- I'd kill for those.
- Well, now yeah, sure.

05:48.997 --> 05:51.290
- ls that your card?
- Yes!

05:51.458 --> 05:53.084
My God, that is incredible!

05:53.251 --> 05:54.877
That's what we do.

05:55.045 --> 05:56.796
My God.

05:56.964 --> 05:59.006
How'd you do that?

05:59.174 --> 06:00.633
Come on.

06:00.801 --> 06:03.469
Did you have that
in your mouth the whole time?

06:05.764 --> 06:07.556
What is that?

06:07.724 --> 06:10.434
It's my kitty cat.

06:10.602 --> 06:13.104
Mmm, it is sparkly
and beautiful.

06:13.271 --> 06:14.522
Thanks.

06:14.690 --> 06:16.357
Are you a cat person?

06:16.525 --> 06:18.442
I love cats.

06:18.610 --> 06:19.902
- Yeah?
- Meow.

06:20.070 --> 06:21.404
- I love pussy...
- What?

06:21.571 --> 06:23.322
...cats too.

06:27.244 --> 06:28.452
Excuse me,

06:28.620 --> 06:30.413
you want me to close out
your tab, sir?

06:30.580 --> 06:32.748
Sir?
Somebody's dad show up?

06:34.418 --> 06:36.419
Do you want me to put this
on your daddy's card?

06:38.255 --> 06:40.423
no, you can just close it out.

06:42.009 --> 06:43.509
Awesome.

06:43.677 --> 06:45.177
Fine.

06:45.345 --> 06:46.512
Wow.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.180

06:48.348 --> 06:51.600

- Cool.

06:51.768 --> 06:54.270

06:59.568 --> 07:02.361

costs these days, right?

09:23.503 --> 09:25.713
soda or a sofa?

- Well...

09:34.723 --> 09:36.807
I guess.

09:36.975 --> 09:38.267
I’m a down front kind of guy.

09:38.435 --> 09:41.020
No no no no.
Seven rows from the back,

09:41.188 --> 09:43.189
and four in from the left.

09:43.356 --> 09:45.191
That's pretty specific.

09:45.358 --> 09:48.235
Yeah, it's sort of OCD,
but screw it.

09:48.403 --> 09:50.404
I like what I like,
you know what I mean?

09:50.572 --> 09:52.364
Yeah, I do.
I almost always,

09:52.532 --> 09:54.867
after I click my lock
a couple times on my door...

09:55.035 --> 09:57.203
So, Barry, what do you do?

09:57.370 --> 09:58.954
Architecture.

10:00.957 --> 10:03.834
Barry,

10:04.002 --> 10:05.920
if I told you right now

10:06.087 --> 10:08.380
that you would never ever ever

10:08.548 --> 10:10.257
get your hand down my pants,

10:10.425 --> 10:13.469
would you still talk to me?

10:13.637 --> 10:16.722
Talk about what?

10:25.523 --> 10:29.026
Hey...

10:31.738 --> 10:33.572
What the hell's goin' on?

10:33.740 --> 10:35.616
Dad, what are you doing here?

10:35.784 --> 10:38.077
Dad? Sir...

10:38.245 --> 10:39.828
I do remember thinking

10:39.996 --> 10:43.749
why would a dude
bring a trumpet into a movie theater?

10:52.842 --> 10:54.593
Barry?

10:56.221 --> 10:58.806
Barry, can you
tell us what happened?

11:00.684 --> 11:02.935
We were talking
about architecture.

11:03.103 --> 11:06.313
Barry, I’m sorry to be the one
to have to tell you,

11:06.481 --> 11:08.649
but we couldn't save them.

11:08.817 --> 11:11.277
Save who?

11:11.444 --> 11:14.697
Barry, your testes.

11:16.449 --> 11:18.909
Testicles.
We had to remove both.

11:19.077 --> 11:22.037
We really tried
to save the left one,

11:22.205 --> 11:24.790
but it was simply too ruptured.

11:24.958 --> 11:28.168
It seems that during
the accident with the...

11:28.336 --> 11:30.379
- Trumpet.
- ...trumpet.

11:30.547 --> 11:32.464
What are you saying?

11:32.632 --> 11:35.301
You're saying I lost my what?

11:35.468 --> 11:37.136
Amnesia.

11:40.307 --> 11:42.057
- Did I lose my...
- Whoa.

11:42.225 --> 11:44.601
- ...you know?
- Penis?

11:44.769 --> 11:47.313
No.

11:50.984 --> 11:55.112
You really don't remember
what happened to you down there?

11:57.574 --> 11:59.992
We were talking
about architecture.

12:02.454 --> 12:04.788
Get out of there.

12:10.253 --> 12:12.838
This is kinda like
when you had your tonsils out.

and all these guys

13:16.569 --> 13:17.903
were like looking at me,

13:18.071 --> 13:20.364
and they're like,
"Best habitat ever."

I guess I forgot to
mention my girlfriend Lida Griggs

13:31.501 --> 13:34.044
was out of town
when the incident occurred.

13:34.212 --> 13:36.380
It's a long story,
but we don't see each other

13:36.548 --> 13:38.757
for sometimes weeks
or months at a time.

13:38.925 --> 13:41.051
I need to borrow

13:42.429 --> 13:45.222
Pretty sure we don't
really like each other.

13:52.063 --> 13:54.064
Let's go, lover.

13:54.232 --> 13:56.859
We're going to try something
new today, lover.

14:00.530 --> 14:03.740
Lida, why don't we
just watch a movie?

14:03.908 --> 14:05.117
Shh.

14:10.415 --> 14:12.708
- Lida, I...
- All tight?

14:12.876 --> 14:14.209
Yeah.

14:14.377 --> 14:17.045
But we should talk first.

14:17.213 --> 14:19.923
Why don't we start
by talking about...

14:20.091 --> 14:21.300
this?

14:22.635 --> 14:24.235
I found it in your car
when I was looking

14:24.259 --> 14:26.096
for my lavender and
vanilla body soufflé.

14:26.264 --> 14:28.307
Lida, listen...

14:28.475 --> 14:31.852
- ls it true?
- Um...

14:32.020 --> 14:33.854
- Did you show her your penis?
- What?

14:34.022 --> 14:35.397
- You whore!
- No, Lida...

14:35.565 --> 14:37.165
- Did you let her play with this?
- Stop.

14:41.571 --> 14:43.238
I had an accident.

14:43.406 --> 14:47.451
Barry, I don't know
what all of this is,

14:47.619 --> 14:51.038
but Peaches and I have no sympathy
for cheating assholes.

14:51.206 --> 14:53.582
And if you think
the love I give you

14:53.750 --> 14:55.501
is all fun and games,

14:55.668 --> 14:58.003
well...

14:58.171 --> 15:00.047
you had better sleep
with one eye open, mister.

15:00.215 --> 15:02.007
Can you untie me?

15:03.343 --> 15:04.551
Come, Peaches.

15:17.524 --> 15:19.775
Barry honey, it's Mom.

15:19.943 --> 15:22.110
I picked up your hormone pills
at the pharmacy.

15:22.278 --> 15:23.737
Honey?

15:23.905 --> 15:25.985
Barry, I hope it's okay,
but I brought Janice with me

15:26.009 --> 15:28.427
- from my Latin dance symposium.
- Hi, Barry.

15:31.246 --> 15:32.746
Excuse me, Lonnie?

15:34.165 --> 15:36.291
Talk to you later.

15:39.546 --> 15:42.381
Hey, um...

15:46.386 --> 15:49.263
I was wondering
if I could take a leave of absence.

15:49.430 --> 15:52.975
Um, I had a...
with a...

15:53.142 --> 15:56.061
and um...

15:56.229 --> 15:58.063
just wonderin'
if I could take a few days off.

15:58.231 --> 16:01.650
It's all I'm thinkin'...
just time to get, you know.

16:01.818 --> 16:05.112
Basically,
I have some family issues.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.489
Now, first of all Barry,
you're lying.

16:09.534 --> 16:11.054
I’ve been in this business
for 40 years

16:11.078 --> 16:12.744
and I can always
tell the difference.

16:12.912 --> 16:14.746
You don't have
any family issues, do you?

16:14.914 --> 16:17.749
Well, I have...

16:21.504 --> 16:23.463
Well, you're just lazy.

16:23.631 --> 16:24.965
You know, you sit in your office

16:25.133 --> 16:26.675
pretending to be
on the telephone,

16:26.843 --> 16:28.302
shuffling papers all day,

16:28.469 --> 16:30.029
and every hour or so
you get up and walk

16:30.054 --> 16:32.931
around Lucy's desk
like a four-balled tomcat.

16:33.099 --> 16:35.392
And what's worse,

16:35.560 --> 16:37.603
you don't even care enough
to cover it up.

16:39.397 --> 16:41.565
Also,

16:41.733 --> 16:44.067
it's just my opinion, but...

16:45.278 --> 16:47.779
I don't think men
should wear makeup.

16:50.199 --> 16:53.035
See you tomorrow, Barry.

16:54.162 --> 16:55.954
Okay.

16:58.124 --> 17:00.167
You have one message.

17:00.335 --> 17:02.669
Yo, Mundo,

17:02.837 --> 17:04.557
you know who it is.
Where the hell you been?

17:04.714 --> 17:06.589
Shit, bro, listen,

17:06.758 --> 17:08.425
you'll never guess
where I am right now.

17:08.593 --> 17:11.678
Regional Air Guitar Semifinals.

17:11.846 --> 17:13.722
So, I was thinkin',

17:13.890 --> 17:15.723
if I make it onto the finals,

17:15.892 --> 17:17.309
maybe you could use
a little ta-da,

17:17.477 --> 17:19.519
we raise a glass
down at the Beaver Tree.

17:19.686 --> 17:21.438
Titty bar bush, baby.

17:21.606 --> 17:23.940
Be there, or be a fuckin' tool.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.651
Later!

17:25.818 --> 17:28.319
End of messages.

17:44.962 --> 17:46.505
"Dear Mr. Munday,"

17:46.673 --> 17:48.840
I have been retained
to represent the interests

17:49.008 --> 17:50.509
of Miss Ginger Farley.

17:50.677 --> 17:52.397
Miss Farley believes
that you are the father

17:52.512 --> 17:56.682
of her unborn child conceived
on or about February 11th.

17:56.849 --> 17:58.892
I have been retained
to establish paternity,

17:59.060 --> 18:00.936
and to obtain
a child support order

18:01.104 --> 18:04.022
consistent with our state's
rules of judicial administration.

18:04.190 --> 18:05.982
If you wish to admit paternity,

18:06.150 --> 18:08.443
I can draft
all necessary documents.

18:08.611 --> 18:10.529
If you wish to deny paternity,

18:10.697 --> 18:12.989
I will seek an order
of the court for DNA testing.

18:13.157 --> 18:15.534
Please contact me
within 10 days.

18:15.702 --> 18:19.246
"Sincerely, Newton Creech,
Attorney at Law."

18:26.379 --> 18:28.880
Ginger Farley?

18:29.048 --> 18:31.591
Who the fuck is Ginger Farley?

18:34.345 --> 18:37.139
Mr. Munday,
Newton Creech here.

18:37.306 --> 18:40.892
Hi.
Yes sir, um,

18:41.060 --> 18:42.644
well, I got your letter.

18:42.812 --> 18:44.646
Yes you did.

18:44.814 --> 18:48.316
First off, this Ginger Farley,

18:48.484 --> 18:51.445
how does she know
that I’m the father of the baby?

18:51.612 --> 18:53.739
I mean...

18:53.906 --> 18:55.574
well, yeah, how does she know?

18:55.742 --> 18:57.367
That's an easy question.

18:57.535 --> 18:59.455
According to Miss Farley,
she has had intercourse

18:59.479 --> 19:01.413
one time in her entire life...

19:01.581 --> 19:04.624
with you, on February 11th
of this year.

19:04.792 --> 19:08.545
It wasn't hard for her
to figure it out.

19:08.713 --> 19:11.673
Wow. Okay.

19:11.841 --> 19:13.717
Where did we meet,

19:13.885 --> 19:16.303
me and Miss Farley?

19:16.471 --> 19:18.597
Let's not play games, Barry.

19:18.765 --> 19:20.974
If you want to play games,
please, go hire a lawyer.

19:21.142 --> 19:22.642
No, sir, I’m not playing games.

19:22.810 --> 19:24.144
I just...

19:24.312 --> 19:27.272
Hey, just wanna make sure
the baby's mine, right?

19:27.440 --> 19:31.526
Um, I mean, I'll take
a blood test voluntarily.

19:31.694 --> 19:33.320
Do you really have
no recollection

19:33.488 --> 19:35.489
of your sexual encounter
with Ginger Farley?

19:35.656 --> 19:38.784
Because Mr. Munday,
I find that really hard to believe.

19:38.951 --> 19:42.120
So...

19:42.288 --> 19:44.164
could we meet,

19:44.332 --> 19:46.249
Ginger Farley and I?

19:46.417 --> 19:48.502
Maybe coffee, or pastry?

19:48.669 --> 19:51.588
Wow. You know
what I’m gonna do?

19:51.756 --> 19:53.876
I'm gonna tell Ginger
you'd like to meet her somewhere

19:53.900 --> 19:55.967
and she can call you.
How's that?

19:56.135 --> 19:58.428
That'd be great.
Okay.

19:58.596 --> 20:01.306
You know, Mr. Munday,
they say one man's burden

20:01.474 --> 20:03.475
can be another man's happiness.

20:03.643 --> 20:05.852
Thank you.

20:09.524 --> 20:12.400
It's strange, I honestly can't explain

20:12.568 --> 20:15.320
why it only occurred
to me just now,

20:15.488 --> 20:17.656
I end with me.

20:17.824 --> 20:19.157
No more Mundays.

20:19.325 --> 20:21.827
I’m it, the very last.

20:21.994 --> 20:25.288
That thought rose slowly
to the surface of my mind,

20:25.456 --> 20:27.833
and on top of everything else.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.169
I guess it never seemed
important before.

20:31.337 --> 20:34.005
Marriage?
No thank you.

20:34.173 --> 20:35.924
Children?
They smell,

20:36.092 --> 20:38.343
and grow up to hate you
and take your money.

20:38.511 --> 20:39.970
Sure, I grew up
without a father.

20:40.137 --> 20:43.557
Maybe that colored my outlook
on life, I don't know.

20:43.724 --> 20:46.685
All I know is
I once had options.

20:48.396 --> 20:50.272
My balls were great.

20:50.439 --> 20:52.315
I was great.

20:55.778 --> 20:57.445
I’m pretty sure I was great.

21:03.870 --> 21:07.038
Line 1, a Ginger Farley.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.709
Good luck.

21:11.836 --> 21:13.503
What does that mean?

21:18.676 --> 21:20.677
Shee-ee...

21:29.896 --> 21:32.647
Why'd you want
to meet me, Barry?

21:32.815 --> 21:34.399
Ginger.

21:34.567 --> 21:36.192
It's good to see you.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.569
ls it?

21:38.654 --> 21:40.614
Yes.

21:47.872 --> 21:50.582
This is familiar.

21:51.584 --> 21:53.501
This is where we met, Barry.

21:53.669 --> 21:55.587
Right over there.

21:59.425 --> 22:00.545
- You want to sit down?
- No.

22:00.593 --> 22:02.010
Yeah.

22:02.178 --> 22:03.595
So, how far along are you?

22:03.763 --> 22:06.640
Well, on February 11th,

22:06.807 --> 22:08.183
a few moments before midnight,

22:08.351 --> 22:10.685
your little sperm army
stormed my pink beach.

22:10.853 --> 22:13.605
So, you count the days.

22:15.900 --> 22:18.652
Newton said you had
no memory of our sex.

22:18.819 --> 22:20.278
He did?

22:20.446 --> 22:22.113
What an asshole.

22:22.281 --> 22:23.782
Right.

22:23.950 --> 22:26.952
No, you...
you're an asshole.

22:28.704 --> 22:31.957
Ginger, I don't mean to offend,

22:32.124 --> 22:34.376
but are you totally,

22:34.543 --> 22:38.046
100%, absolutely, positivo sure

22:38.214 --> 22:39.506
that the baby's mine?

22:39.674 --> 22:41.216
You little shit-eater.

22:41.384 --> 22:43.385
I am weak one night,

22:43.552 --> 22:46.930
one night, and with
a shit-eater like you.

22:47.098 --> 22:48.431
God knows why,

22:48.599 --> 22:49.849
and now you want to sit here

22:50.017 --> 22:51.851
at Snatchers and ask me crap?

22:52.019 --> 22:55.438
Yes, Barry, I’m "positivo"
the baby is yours.

22:55.606 --> 22:58.608
And you're not going to run away
from your responsibility.

23:00.069 --> 23:01.486
Do you mind if I touch it?

23:01.654 --> 23:03.374
I don't know why I said that.

23:03.489 --> 23:04.864
Touch what?

23:05.032 --> 23:06.533
Your belly,

23:06.701 --> 23:08.284
touch where the baby is.

23:08.452 --> 23:09.786
Ooh!

23:09.954 --> 23:11.246
I’ll have Newton call you,

23:11.414 --> 23:13.039
and he'll go over
the paternity test,

23:13.207 --> 23:14.958
and the paternity
acknowledgment forms.

23:15.126 --> 23:17.460
That is, if you decide
to sign them.

23:17.628 --> 23:19.546
Goodbye, Barry.

23:19.714 --> 23:22.215
- Goodbye.
- Asshole shit-eater.

25:29.802 --> 25:32.929
- You're not gonna take the...
- Yeah, I don't need to take a test.

25:33.097 --> 25:35.181
Why not?

25:35.349 --> 25:36.766
Because I know.

25:36.934 --> 25:39.060
You know?

25:39.228 --> 25:42.230
Yeah.
I feel it.

25:42.398 --> 25:43.648
You feel it?

25:43.816 --> 25:45.692
Yes.

25:46.694 --> 25:49.571
I got you a drink.
It's virgin.

25:49.738 --> 25:52.115
Very funny, Barry.
What do you want from me?

25:52.283 --> 25:54.826
I don't kn...
nothing, I just...

25:54.994 --> 25:56.369
What did you want from me?

25:56.537 --> 25:58.955
- Do you think I’m after money?
- No.

25:59.123 --> 26:01.499
You don't think that if you were there
for the passion of our sex

26:01.667 --> 26:03.787
that you should be accountable
and take responsibility

26:03.919 --> 26:05.587
for this little miracle
that we made?

26:05.754 --> 26:08.214
No, I’m saying I want to take
responsibility here.

26:08.382 --> 26:11.134
- This isn't all my fault!
- Why are you yelling at me?

26:11.302 --> 26:12.635
Shit-eater.

26:12.803 --> 26:14.643
Ginger, I’m saying
I want to be a part of this,

26:14.667 --> 26:16.598
like a real dad, you know?

26:16.765 --> 26:19.100
With dedication...

26:19.268 --> 26:22.187
financially, spiritually, morally.

26:24.023 --> 26:26.191
Look, I don't have
to be in your life.

26:26.358 --> 26:28.526
You and I don't have
to be, you know...

26:28.694 --> 26:31.321
but for the baby,

26:31.488 --> 26:33.781
I think we should be
friendly, friends.

26:33.949 --> 26:36.075
Friends.

26:44.043 --> 26:45.710
Cheers.

26:48.422 --> 26:50.381
So, do we know
if it's a boy or a girl

26:50.549 --> 26:53.760
from the x-ray?

26:53.928 --> 26:56.554
We call that a sonogram,
and no, I haven't found out.

26:56.722 --> 26:58.723
I don't want to know.

27:00.559 --> 27:02.101
How's the drink?

27:02.269 --> 27:05.396
It's awful.
This straw is ridiculous.

27:07.983 --> 27:09.609
So, can I touch the baby?

27:09.777 --> 27:11.903
Can I touch your belly now?

27:32.466 --> 27:34.509
Can I go to the doctor with you?

27:36.845 --> 27:38.972
Don't get the wrong idea, Barry.

27:39.139 --> 27:41.057
You're still a shit-eater.

27:49.275 --> 27:50.692
Hey.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.952
Green Insurance,
Barry Munday speaking.

28:13.882 --> 28:16.467
Why don't you ask her if you
can have a squirt?

28:18.178 --> 28:21.806
Ginger Farley?
Come on back.

28:24.351 --> 28:26.144
Yeah.

28:33.944 --> 28:37.155
So, don't ask me why,
but my parents want to meet you.

28:37.323 --> 28:39.163
They want you to come
to dinner tomorrow night.

28:41.744 --> 28:44.120
It's stupid, so...
I mean, it's not my idea.

28:44.288 --> 28:46.008
If you don't want to go,
I'll just tell them

28:46.123 --> 28:48.283
that you don't want to go
and that'll be the end of it.

28:48.307 --> 28:49.375
No, I’ll go.

28:49.543 --> 28:51.836
My parents won't like you.

28:53.005 --> 28:54.172
Why not?

28:54.340 --> 28:56.841
They just won't.

28:58.177 --> 29:00.970
Knock-knock.

29:02.890 --> 29:04.682
- Hi.
- Hey, Ginger, how're we feeling?

29:04.850 --> 29:07.894
Well, my feet are swollen,

29:08.062 --> 29:09.437
I pee 2,000 times a day,

29:09.605 --> 29:11.230
I haven't taken
a shit since Tuesday,

29:11.398 --> 29:14.901
and my nipples are like black.

29:15.069 --> 29:18.946
Okay. Good, let's see here
what we have.

29:19.114 --> 29:21.908
We have a possible
due date of December 10th.

29:22.076 --> 29:23.409
Sweet.

29:23.577 --> 29:24.744
Yeah.

29:24.912 --> 29:27.152
So, you still thinking
of having the water birth at home?

29:27.247 --> 29:29.123
- Yeah.
- What's a water birth at home?

29:29.291 --> 29:31.918
I want to have the baby
submerged in water,

29:32.086 --> 29:35.171
naturally, and beautifully.

29:35.339 --> 29:38.424
Do you mean like in your tub?

29:38.592 --> 29:41.719
Actually, we use a little wading pool
with warm water.

29:41.887 --> 29:44.055
The midwife is in there
for natural childbirth.

29:44.223 --> 29:45.556
I think it's great.

29:45.724 --> 29:48.101
It's beautiful, and Dr. Shriver
thinks it's great.

29:49.353 --> 29:50.812
Yeah, okay.

29:50.979 --> 29:52.230
Um, Dr. Shriver,

29:52.398 --> 29:55.149
I’m Barry Munday.
I'm the father.

29:55.317 --> 29:58.194
I was... basically,
I was just hoping

29:58.362 --> 30:00.405
I could ask a few questions,
if you don't mind.

30:00.572 --> 30:02.532
Okay, ask away.

30:02.699 --> 30:04.158
All right, um, well,

30:04.326 --> 30:07.328
will I be allowed
to participate in the birth?

30:07.496 --> 30:11.082
I’d like to be there to help with
the baby when it comes out.

30:11.250 --> 30:13.876
Absolutely. You and the midwife
will be side by side.

30:14.044 --> 30:15.586
Just listen to her,

30:15.754 --> 30:17.713
watch the videos,
and take the classes.

30:17.881 --> 30:19.590
Okay, awesome.

30:19.758 --> 30:22.427
Um, are there any foods
that Ginger shouldn't eat?

30:22.594 --> 30:26.097
I read somewhere that pregnant women
shouldn't eat blue cheese.

30:26.265 --> 30:27.890
Are you retarded?

30:28.058 --> 30:30.143
I never heard the one
about the blue cheese.

30:30.310 --> 30:34.772
I heard that
sometimes women poop,

30:34.940 --> 30:36.774
like during the birth.

30:36.942 --> 30:38.109
It's natural.

30:45.284 --> 30:46.784
Um...

30:46.952 --> 30:48.453
I read online
that it was possible

30:48.620 --> 30:51.664
for doctors to identify patients
by their vaginas.

30:51.832 --> 30:54.167
Did you hear that?

30:54.334 --> 30:57.295
I was just curious.

30:57.463 --> 30:58.713
Good luck to you, son.

30:58.881 --> 31:02.300
- Yeah, it's not important.
- No.

31:02.468 --> 31:04.886
Ginger, I’ll see you next week.

31:11.602 --> 31:13.060
Okay, well,

31:13.228 --> 31:15.313
I guess,...

31:15.481 --> 31:17.648
So, tomorrow night.

31:17.816 --> 31:19.484
For what?

31:21.153 --> 31:23.070
Dinner with my parents.

31:23.238 --> 31:24.572
- Right.
- Jesus!

31:24.740 --> 31:26.741
No...
it's awesome.

31:28.494 --> 31:29.994
So, hey...

31:30.162 --> 31:31.996
Good night, Barry.

31:34.124 --> 31:38.002
That's cool.
I’m really tired.

31:38.170 --> 31:40.004
Hi.

31:46.345 --> 31:48.012
Okay.

32:02.402 --> 32:04.162
This is our second child,

32:04.186 --> 32:05.738
and while my wife knows

32:05.906 --> 32:07.698
that she won't fit
into her old clothes,

32:07.866 --> 32:09.700
she's still beautiful.

32:09.868 --> 32:11.661
And it's my job to tell her

32:11.828 --> 32:15.206
that she looks amazing
all the time.

32:15.374 --> 32:17.250
Hi, beautiful.
Hi.

32:17.417 --> 32:21.462
Which I try to do
as regularly as possible.

32:33.892 --> 32:35.560
Hi.

32:38.397 --> 32:40.648
You're early.

32:58.667 --> 33:00.543
What?

33:00.711 --> 33:04.088
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

33:04.256 --> 33:08.467
but that dress
doesn't do you justice.

33:10.053 --> 33:11.887
That's interesting, Barry.

33:12.055 --> 33:14.098
You didn't seem to have
a problem with this dress

33:14.266 --> 33:17.268
the night you pulled it
off my body and had sex with me.

33:20.897 --> 33:23.482
So, I've been
kickin' around some names.

33:23.650 --> 33:25.276
The baby already has a name.

33:25.444 --> 33:27.194
What is it?

33:27.362 --> 33:28.946
If it's a boy, Haywood.

33:29.114 --> 33:32.199
- Haywood?
- Mm-

33:33.368 --> 33:34.785
Haywood Munday?

33:34.953 --> 33:38.039
- Don't be stupid.
- What?

33:38.206 --> 33:39.790
The baby's last name
won't be Munday.

33:39.958 --> 33:41.542
Why not?

33:41.710 --> 33:43.461
Because we're not
married, idiot.

33:43.629 --> 33:45.463
l-l...
but I’m the father.

33:45.631 --> 33:48.716
- So?
- So...

33:48.884 --> 33:50.468
Come on, I mean, I...

33:50.636 --> 33:52.386
I stepped up
to the responsibility.

33:52.554 --> 33:53.888
One trip to my doctor to ask him

33:54.056 --> 33:56.474
about his other patients'
vaginas is not stepping up.

33:56.642 --> 33:58.100
Yeah, but it's our baby, right?

33:58.268 --> 34:00.311
It's yours and mine, right?

34:00.479 --> 34:02.980
I mean I'm here,
Ginger. I’m the father.

34:03.148 --> 34:05.399
Fine, fine!

34:05.567 --> 34:07.193
Fine.

34:07.361 --> 34:08.902
The baby won't have a last name.

34:09.071 --> 34:10.862
It'll just be Haywood.

34:11.031 --> 34:12.489
No, that...
just Haywood?

34:14.284 --> 34:16.369
I don't think you can do that
legally, can you?

34:16.536 --> 34:19.664
Why not? Lots of famous people
in history only have one name.

34:19.831 --> 34:21.165
Moses.

34:21.333 --> 34:22.833
Cleopatra.

34:23.001 --> 34:24.502
Calvin.

34:25.712 --> 34:28.964
- Who's Calvin?
- Jesus.

34:30.050 --> 34:31.926
So, if the baby
only gets one name,

34:32.094 --> 34:33.427
why do you get to decide?

34:33.594 --> 34:36.389
Why?

34:36.556 --> 34:39.516
'Cause this baby's
in me, not you.

34:39.685 --> 34:42.770
Because every minute
I’m making a human being, not you.

34:42.938 --> 34:44.897
And because my tits
feel like two ziplock bags

34:45.065 --> 34:47.233
full of dried-up oatmeal.
Do yours?

34:47.400 --> 34:49.318
I don't think it's fair

34:49.485 --> 34:51.362
to use my biological
disadvantages against me.

34:51.530 --> 34:53.531
You know I’d switch places
with you if I could.

34:54.949 --> 34:56.367
I would, seriously.

34:56.534 --> 34:58.035
I go to work alone,
I sleep alone,

34:58.203 --> 35:00.203
but you get to experience
a connection to this baby

35:00.330 --> 35:02.289
I am completely excluded from.

35:09.506 --> 35:12.550
Just so you know, my parents think
that you put drugs in my drink

35:12.718 --> 35:14.927
and had intercourse
with me while I was unconscious.

35:16.596 --> 35:18.764
Honey, well...

35:18.932 --> 35:20.433
This is for you.

35:27.065 --> 35:29.400
Come with me, son.

35:31.027 --> 35:34.155
- I want you to see a few of these trophies.
- Wonderful.

35:34.322 --> 35:38.200
- Who's this?
- This is our youngest, Jennifer.

35:39.619 --> 35:41.162
Any pictures of Ginger?

35:41.329 --> 35:43.164
Yeah...

35:43.331 --> 35:44.749
No.

35:44.916 --> 35:47.251
She doesn't like pictures.

35:47.419 --> 35:49.879
Sit down, son.

35:59.139 --> 36:01.140
So, Mr. Munday,

36:01.308 --> 36:04.477
we've got ourselves a bit
of a situation here, don't we?

36:04.644 --> 36:06.687
Yes, sir.
Um...

36:06.855 --> 36:10.274
I... I'm not sure
what you've been told

36:10.442 --> 36:12.568
concerning my actions.

36:12.736 --> 36:14.028
Wait a minute.

36:14.196 --> 36:16.280
Did you not tell my daughter
that you would accept

36:16.448 --> 36:20.034
full responsibility for being
father of this baby, you shit-eater?

36:20.202 --> 36:23.287
- Yes, um...
- Financially, morally?

36:23.455 --> 36:26.081
- I...
- I'm sorry, but did you not say

36:26.249 --> 36:29.335
that all these things
would be your actions, Mr. Munday?

36:29.503 --> 36:30.836
I thought
you-you were...

36:31.004 --> 36:32.964
Nah, that's... I thought
you were talking about...

36:32.988 --> 36:35.782
About what? Talking about what?
What are you talking about?

36:37.344 --> 36:38.677
Nothing.

36:38.845 --> 36:40.638
Nothing?

36:47.646 --> 36:51.857
Mr. Munday,
Ginger is hardheaded,

36:52.025 --> 36:54.985
and yes, unappreciative at times

36:55.153 --> 36:57.446
of her family's love,

36:57.614 --> 37:01.367
but she is my daughter.

37:02.994 --> 37:04.161
Remember that.

37:04.329 --> 37:05.538
Yes sir.

37:05.705 --> 37:06.872
Good.

37:10.293 --> 37:12.336
Pumpkin farm!

37:14.506 --> 37:15.840
Dinner's ready.

37:16.007 --> 37:17.341
I expect you'll be
looking forward

37:17.509 --> 37:19.677
to continuing this
later on, Mr. Munday.

37:19.845 --> 37:21.637
Yes sir.

37:23.557 --> 37:25.266
So, you're Barry the rapist.

37:25.433 --> 37:27.768
Tell us about yourself, Barry.

37:27.936 --> 37:29.478
This is the first time

37:29.646 --> 37:32.606
Ginger has ever
brought a man home to meet us.

37:32.774 --> 37:34.692
Our Jennifer brings
fellas home all the time.

37:34.860 --> 37:36.110
But that's Jennifer.

37:36.278 --> 37:37.278
I’m a slut.

37:37.445 --> 37:38.863
You stop that.

37:39.030 --> 37:40.531
She is not a slut.

37:40.699 --> 37:42.366
She's graduating
from business school

37:42.534 --> 37:45.035
and she plays three instruments.

37:45.203 --> 37:49.540
Jennifer is very
very special... ed.

37:54.421 --> 37:56.661
Personally, I think
this is nice for Ginger,

37:56.685 --> 37:59.758
even though I don't approve of the way
the two of you did your business.

37:59.926 --> 38:01.844
- Mom...
- I blame myself.

38:02.012 --> 38:04.847
I tell her it's not natural
to be by herself all the time.

38:05.015 --> 38:06.932
I’ve told her this
since she was 14,

38:07.100 --> 38:09.435
"You need to put on makeup,
nice dresses,

38:09.603 --> 38:11.020
show some pride,
like Jennifer."

38:11.187 --> 38:12.605
Leave her alone, Mom.

38:13.899 --> 38:15.190
Let's ask Barry.

38:15.358 --> 38:17.401
You like makeup, don't you?

38:17.569 --> 38:19.904
- I...
- She does it for attention.

38:20.071 --> 38:21.991
- I can't believe this.
- Calm down.

38:22.015 --> 38:24.450
All I'm saying is,
it's great to have Barry here.

38:24.618 --> 38:26.327
He gets that.

38:27.871 --> 38:29.580
I think Ginger's beautiful.

38:34.920 --> 38:38.088
And personally, as the father,

38:38.256 --> 38:40.049
I feel it's my role

38:40.216 --> 38:41.967
to tell her she looks
amazing all the time,

38:42.135 --> 38:44.053
which I try to do regularly.

38:47.182 --> 38:49.600
So, Barry, um, you were

38:49.768 --> 38:51.685
telling my wife about yourself.

38:51.853 --> 38:54.897
Well, not much to tell, really.

38:55.065 --> 38:57.816
I flirted with architecture
for a while.

38:57.984 --> 39:00.611
I thought about getting
into triathlons,

39:00.779 --> 39:02.112
or relay races.

39:02.280 --> 39:04.323
Been in insurance...
about a year.

39:04.491 --> 39:06.116
Um...

39:06.284 --> 39:09.620
it's good.
It's really good.

39:09.788 --> 39:13.582
- Where?
- It's on Moorpark.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.834
Green Insurance.

39:16.002 --> 39:17.962
Lonnie Green's
a great friend of mine.

39:17.986 --> 39:19.088
I’ll call him,

39:19.255 --> 39:20.965
arrange to have lunch,
the three of us.

39:21.132 --> 39:22.424
That would be great.

39:22.592 --> 39:25.803
Get to know the new
father a little bit.

39:25.971 --> 39:28.639
That sounds good.

39:32.477 --> 39:33.978
Well...

39:35.397 --> 39:37.481
we're gonna have a baby.

39:42.821 --> 39:45.280
That's wonderful.

39:48.827 --> 39:50.661
Anyone like a gin and tonic?

40:03.216 --> 40:05.384
So, where'd you two meet?

40:06.636 --> 40:08.429
Snatchers.

40:10.223 --> 40:12.057
I see.

40:12.225 --> 40:14.518
I guess you knew Barry
before the operation.

40:14.686 --> 40:16.353
I guess so.

40:21.026 --> 40:24.236
So, Ginger, mother to mother,

40:24.404 --> 40:26.655
what is it that you want
for this baby?

40:27.741 --> 40:30.617
Besides healthy?

40:30.785 --> 40:33.537
I guess I just want
my child to feel

40:33.705 --> 40:36.373
loved and appreciated,

40:36.541 --> 40:39.710
even if it's 180 degrees
different from me.

40:41.254 --> 40:44.465
I would be very proud
to have a gay child.

40:50.472 --> 40:52.512
So, where are we having
this wonderful new addition?

40:52.536 --> 40:54.099
St. Joseph's?

40:54.267 --> 40:56.060
I'm having
a water birth at home.

40:56.227 --> 40:58.062
Huh.
huh.

40:58.229 --> 41:00.105
Yeah, the doctor
thought it was a great idea.

41:00.273 --> 41:02.983
And it's natural and beautiful.

41:03.151 --> 41:04.943
So...

41:05.111 --> 41:07.237
Well, I’d like to do whatever
I can to help out.

41:07.405 --> 41:09.406
You're gonna need
a baby bed, and bottles,

41:09.574 --> 41:11.784
and lots and lots of diapers.

41:11.951 --> 41:13.285
That's great, Mom.
Thanks.

41:13.453 --> 41:16.330
I appreciate it, but my baby
won't be wearing diapers.

41:16.498 --> 41:18.018
I mean, why is it
we can teach a kitten

41:18.124 --> 41:20.250
just a few months old
to use a sandbox,

41:20.418 --> 41:22.920
but a child,
infinitely more intelligent,

41:23.088 --> 41:25.088
walks around shitting in their pants
for two years?

41:25.112 --> 41:27.591
Ginger read that.
This doctor... what's his name?

41:27.759 --> 41:31.261
Plus, all the harmful
pathogens in human feces,

41:31.429 --> 41:33.639
just smushed in there

41:33.807 --> 41:36.725
in that hot incubator
of a diaper.

41:42.190 --> 41:44.399
She comes from
a really nice family...

41:44.567 --> 41:47.194
wealthy, nice house.

41:47.362 --> 41:48.987
Her sister plays
three instruments.

41:49.155 --> 41:53.117
Honey, I don't care
if she's a Kennedy.

41:53.284 --> 41:55.410
A cat box?

41:55.578 --> 41:57.788
She wants to train your baby
to use a cat box.

41:57.956 --> 41:59.540
Can you imagine?

42:01.126 --> 42:02.960
There she is!

42:03.128 --> 42:04.461
Where is your bathroom?

42:04.629 --> 42:05.921
Go around this corner

42:06.089 --> 42:07.422
and through the living room,

42:07.590 --> 42:10.843
just on your right,
past the zebra.

42:14.013 --> 42:16.473
A cat box.

42:21.396 --> 42:24.481
You want to maybe
tell me about this operation

42:24.649 --> 42:27.985
in case I get placed
in that situation again, "honey"?

42:31.030 --> 42:32.698
Um...

42:34.200 --> 42:37.035
I went to a matinee
a few months ago,

42:37.203 --> 42:40.873
um... one second

42:41.040 --> 42:43.000
I was watching a movie...

42:43.168 --> 42:44.168
No!

42:44.335 --> 42:46.753
...and six hours later

42:46.921 --> 42:49.840
I woke up in a hospital

42:50.008 --> 42:53.343
where they had removed
my testicles.

42:59.350 --> 43:01.560
What happened in the matinee?

43:05.023 --> 43:06.940
I wish I knew.

43:07.108 --> 43:10.527
I actually have no memory
due to the trauma.

43:10.695 --> 43:13.280
Are you serious?

43:13.448 --> 43:16.950
Well, the doctor said
it may come back eventually,

43:17.118 --> 43:18.785
um, maybe not,

43:18.953 --> 43:21.371
but I hope so.

43:22.749 --> 43:24.750
You have no testicles.

43:28.546 --> 43:30.547
I don't know why
I never told you about...

43:30.715 --> 43:34.593
about it before,
but with the baby,

43:34.761 --> 43:38.138
you being pregnant
was a real miracle

43:38.306 --> 43:39.640
in a lot of ways.

43:39.807 --> 43:43.060
- Shut up.
- No, come on, I’m serious.

43:43.228 --> 43:45.187
I don't know, I just...

43:45.355 --> 43:47.314
you came,

43:47.482 --> 43:49.608
and there's purpose now.

43:50.902 --> 43:52.527
Direction.

43:55.657 --> 43:57.366
- Morning, Hoss.
- Hey.

43:57.533 --> 43:59.743
- Free for lunch?
- Sure.

43:59.911 --> 44:02.746
Good, an old buddy of mine, Tom,
asked for you specifically.

44:02.914 --> 44:04.581
- Tom...?
- Tom Farley.

44:04.749 --> 44:06.250
Asked for my number one
shit-eater.

44:08.711 --> 44:10.963
Aw, man, I’d love to get a piece
of that business.

44:11.130 --> 44:12.673
How do you know Tom, anyway?

44:12.840 --> 44:16.301
I’m,... I’m friends
with his daughter.

44:19.764 --> 44:22.766
- Tom!
- Lon! How're you doin'?

44:22.934 --> 44:25.018
- Nice to see you, man!
- You look spectacular!

44:25.186 --> 44:26.561
You've lost weight, man.

44:26.729 --> 44:28.647
You don't mind if my daughter
joins us, do you?

44:28.815 --> 44:30.375
I was downtown shopping, so...

44:30.441 --> 44:32.041
No no, not at all.
Nice to see you again.

44:32.193 --> 44:34.194
You too.
Hi, Barry.

44:34.362 --> 44:37.698
- Hi, Jennifer.
- I think our table's ready.

44:37.865 --> 44:41.118
Thank God, I thought you were talking
about the other daughter.

44:41.286 --> 44:42.786
- Menu, sir?
- Thank you.

44:42.954 --> 44:44.955
Well, anyway,

44:45.123 --> 44:47.291
I’m really glad
we were able to do this,

44:47.458 --> 44:49.626
my old friend and my...

44:54.757 --> 44:56.508
Yeah, Barry is quite a guy.

44:56.676 --> 44:59.011
Yeah.

45:00.680 --> 45:03.807
- So, what's good here?
- I'm a red sauce man, myself.

45:03.975 --> 45:04.975
- Best in town.
- Lonnie:

45:05.143 --> 45:06.977
Hey-yy...

45:07.145 --> 45:09.313
Jen.

45:09.480 --> 45:11.148
Hey, Barry.

45:17.822 --> 45:21.158
The calamari gets good reviews.
Whitefish...

45:21.326 --> 45:23.785
my favorite are the chops.

45:29.959 --> 45:32.586
Specials somewhere.

45:34.213 --> 45:35.881
Hi, lover.

45:36.049 --> 45:39.343
So, this your little kitty cat?

45:39.510 --> 45:43.722
No, Lida. Look, this is not
the time or the place...

45:43.890 --> 45:45.349
Oof!

45:46.351 --> 45:48.560
Gentlemen.

45:52.190 --> 45:53.732
Ooh.

45:53.900 --> 45:56.026
She's an old girlfriend.

45:59.197 --> 46:01.823
Before Ginger.
A long time ago.

46:03.534 --> 46:05.243
Ginger?

46:05.411 --> 46:07.537
My other daughter.

46:25.390 --> 46:28.475
So, I heard you had
an interesting lunch yesterday.

46:31.104 --> 46:34.272
She's an old girlfriend.
She's crazy.

46:34.440 --> 46:36.400
What old girlfriend?

46:39.445 --> 46:41.530
They didn't...
I thought...

46:44.409 --> 46:47.661
I'm kidding.
Of course they told me.

46:47.829 --> 46:49.579
You're such an idiot.

46:51.082 --> 46:52.249
Why do you do that...

46:52.417 --> 46:54.668
all the "idiot,
shit-eater" stuff all the time?

46:54.836 --> 46:56.753
I’m sorry, Barry,

46:56.921 --> 46:58.964
am I hurting your feelings?

47:00.925 --> 47:02.717
No, I mean, ahem...

47:02.885 --> 47:04.386
I’m trying to be nice.

47:06.055 --> 47:08.140
See, I can't win.
It's like you constantly

47:08.307 --> 47:09.975
expect me to disappoint you.

47:10.143 --> 47:12.519
And why would I expect that?

47:14.355 --> 47:15.981
All right,

47:16.149 --> 47:18.525
I’m an idiot shit-eater.

47:18.693 --> 47:21.153
But for the record,
you should know

47:21.320 --> 47:23.363
expectation

47:23.531 --> 47:26.074
is nothing but planned
resentment.

47:28.244 --> 47:31.621
Do you have that written
on a poster on the wall of your office?

47:32.748 --> 47:35.083
No, it's a book,

47:35.251 --> 47:37.502
a good book,
and I think it's true.

47:37.670 --> 47:39.990
And if you want to carry that around
with you all the time,

47:40.014 --> 47:41.381
hey, that's your bag.

47:41.549 --> 47:44.217
But remember, you called me.

47:44.385 --> 47:46.511
And I’m here.

47:50.850 --> 47:52.642
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

47:52.810 --> 47:55.312
I don't blame you
for a goddamn thing.

47:57.732 --> 47:59.608
Well, I want it to matter.

48:00.985 --> 48:02.486
I want you to like me.

48:04.739 --> 48:07.491
Ginger, the doctor
will see you now.

55:05.534 --> 55:07.660
to my sister's graduation.

55:11.498 --> 55:14.751

55:14.919 --> 55:18.504

55:25.220 --> 55:31.017

55:41.695 --> 55:44.238
I’ve been thinking a lot
about the name Cornelia.

55:44.406 --> 55:45.907
Yes?

55:46.075 --> 55:49.786
Well, you just have
to be careful with names,

55:49.954 --> 55:54.582
um, basically, 'cause
children are cruel.

55:54.750 --> 55:56.542
Yes.

55:56.710 --> 55:58.710
And you got to know
they're gonna shorten the name.

55:58.734 --> 56:00.672
They'll call her Corny.

56:00.839 --> 56:04.676
She's a girl... that's
what she'll be called.

56:07.930 --> 56:09.472
Do you like Corny?

56:09.640 --> 56:11.391
Yes I do.

56:14.728 --> 56:16.312
You know what the boys
in high school

56:16.480 --> 56:18.690
are gonna call her?

56:20.693 --> 56:22.568
What?

56:23.570 --> 56:25.655
Horny Corny.

56:25.823 --> 56:28.616
That's what boys
like you will call her, not everybody.

56:28.784 --> 56:32.495
Maybe, but that'll be her name.

56:32.663 --> 56:34.998
Look, I’m not gonna mold my life,
or my child's life

56:35.165 --> 56:38.376
around the actions of perverts
and degenerates.

56:38.544 --> 56:40.336
I’m not afraid of the idiocy
of "Horny Corny"

56:40.504 --> 56:42.630
because it rhymes,
or because it's dirty,

56:42.798 --> 56:44.298
or because people are too lazy

56:44.466 --> 56:46.759
to pronounce
her real name, Cornelia.

56:49.013 --> 56:50.388
And by the way, the next time

56:50.556 --> 56:51.916
you touch my tit
without permission

56:52.057 --> 56:54.350
I will cut you
while you're sleeping.

57:00.858 --> 57:03.109
Hello!
You must be Carol.

57:03.277 --> 57:04.986
It's so nice to finally meet you.
Come in.

57:05.154 --> 57:06.654
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

57:06.822 --> 57:09.198
Barry's always saying
what a nice family Ginger has.

57:09.366 --> 57:11.451
- How sweet.
- Mrs. Munday.

57:11.618 --> 57:13.703
- So nice to meet you at last.
- My pleasure.

57:13.871 --> 57:15.455
- And it's Ms.
- Ms.

57:15.622 --> 57:17.582
- Hi!
- Pumpkin farm!

57:17.750 --> 57:19.834
And this is our youngest, Jenny.

57:20.002 --> 57:21.669
This is Carol, Barry's mother.

57:21.837 --> 57:23.504
Hi, Jennifer.
Congratulations.

57:23.672 --> 57:25.173
- Thanks!
- Hey, Jennifer.

57:25.340 --> 57:27.216
Nice to see you again.

57:27.384 --> 57:29.802
Well, nice to see you
as well, Barry. Nice suit.

57:29.970 --> 57:31.721
Thank you.

57:31.889 --> 57:33.973
Hi, Barry.
Hi, Ms. Munday.

57:34.141 --> 57:35.767
Hi, sweetie.

57:38.479 --> 57:40.730
- Hey.
- Hi. Hello.

57:42.066 --> 57:45.193
Well, shall we go through
and have a little lunch?

57:45.360 --> 57:48.404
- Yes.
- Ms. Munday, may I?

57:52.618 --> 57:53.785
You look nice.

57:53.952 --> 57:56.537
You're wearing a suit.

58:02.252 --> 58:05.254
You want another piece?

58:05.422 --> 58:06.798
Not yet.

58:06.965 --> 58:09.842
- It's kind of gross.
- It's going good.

58:10.010 --> 58:11.260
They can hear you.

58:11.428 --> 58:13.054
- What?
- They can hear you.

58:19.478 --> 58:21.062
- Father Walsh?
- Mm-

58:21.230 --> 58:22.980
Did you hear
about Barry's accident?

58:24.775 --> 58:27.568
Um, no, I don't think I have.

58:27.736 --> 58:30.279
Jennifer, I don't think
this is the time.

58:30.447 --> 58:31.906
It's okay, right, Barry?

58:35.119 --> 58:36.828
See, Barry was at a matinee,

58:36.995 --> 58:39.580
and some whacko
just attacked him.

58:39.748 --> 58:41.374
- Attacked him?
- It was awful.

58:41.542 --> 58:43.459
Okay, Jen,

58:43.627 --> 58:45.128
I don't think
we want to bring up

58:45.295 --> 58:46.587
personal stuff, now do we?

58:46.755 --> 58:48.965
- Jen.
- Phtt-tt!

58:49.133 --> 58:52.301
Anyway, somebody just
comes into the theater

58:52.469 --> 58:55.513
and... right
into his...

58:56.682 --> 58:59.517
...you know,
his balls.

59:01.145 --> 59:03.104
And they never caught
the guy, but...

59:03.272 --> 59:05.189
personally, I think Barry was

59:05.357 --> 59:07.150
makin' time with
another fella's lady.

59:07.317 --> 59:09.986
Okay, Jen.

59:11.947 --> 59:14.073
I’d stop now or you-know-what
will be revealed.

59:14.241 --> 59:16.075
And you don't want that, do ya?

59:16.243 --> 59:19.620
Or scammin' on some little girl
and Daddy caught him.

59:19.788 --> 59:20.872
Pervert.

59:21.039 --> 59:22.331
All right, check it!

59:22.499 --> 59:24.000
10:00
on a Saturday night,

59:24.168 --> 59:26.377
I saw Jennifer
as the featured dancer

59:26.545 --> 59:28.838
at a nudie club
called the Beaver Tree.

59:32.509 --> 59:34.177
Ha!

59:42.853 --> 59:45.354
Sorry to be the one
to tell you all.

59:45.522 --> 59:47.273
I know it's
embarrassing for you.

59:47.441 --> 59:49.984
It was embarrassing for me
to see her on stage.

59:50.152 --> 59:51.944
Believe me.

59:54.031 --> 59:55.990
- Barry...
- Father Walsh.

59:56.158 --> 59:58.367
- Barry...
- She just... she pushed me.

59:58.535 --> 01:00:00.578
I couldn't help it.
Shame on you.

01:00:00.746 --> 01:00:02.246
- Barry...
- It was Whitesnake.

01:00:02.414 --> 01:00:05.166
<i>- Barry...
- ♪ Here I go again on my own... ♪</i>

01:00:05.334 --> 01:00:07.084
Barry, last Saturday night,

01:00:07.252 --> 01:00:09.086
Mr. and Mrs. Farley
and their two daughters

01:00:09.254 --> 01:00:11.088
were at my house

01:00:11.256 --> 01:00:13.090
to discuss Ginger's pregnancy.

01:00:13.258 --> 01:00:15.176
till at least 10:00.

01:00:15.344 --> 01:00:17.094
10:30.

01:00:19.556 --> 01:00:21.224

10:30?

01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:33.986
For the record, sir,

01:00:34.154 --> 01:00:35.780
I had never been
to the Beaver Tree

01:00:35.948 --> 01:00:37.573
previous to that engagement.

01:00:41.286 --> 01:00:43.871
This cake's delicious.

01:00:44.039 --> 01:00:45.581
Thank you.

01:00:45.749 --> 01:00:47.875
- My God!
- What?!

01:00:48.043 --> 01:00:49.502
My water broke.

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:51.670
- Are you serious?
- Are you sure?

01:00:53.715 --> 01:00:55.508
- Call Janice.
- Who's Janice?

01:00:55.676 --> 01:00:57.551
- The midwife, you idiot!
- The midwife, Barry!

01:00:57.719 --> 01:00:59.845
Watch your step!
Watch your step!

01:01:00.013 --> 01:01:02.453
- Barry, there's no room for you!
- You're yelling in my head!

01:01:02.477 --> 01:01:03.641
- What?
- No room!

01:01:03.809 --> 01:01:05.289
You and your mother
take Father Walsh.

01:01:05.313 --> 01:01:08.646
Son, son, this way!

01:01:08.814 --> 01:01:10.694
Get the camera.
Get the camera, hon.

01:01:10.774 --> 01:01:12.775
Here's a good shot
right here. Beautiful.

01:01:12.943 --> 01:01:15.236
Talk to your baby, Ginger.

01:01:15.404 --> 01:01:17.113
- Sandwich? Popcorn?
- I’m okay.

01:01:17.281 --> 01:01:19.782
Okay, Daddy, why don't you
come and be a part of this?

01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:22.201
Talk to your baby, Barry.

01:01:22.369 --> 01:01:24.954
Okay. Um, hi baby.

01:01:25.122 --> 01:01:27.915
I’m Barry Munday.

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:30.334
I wish you all the best...

01:01:30.502 --> 01:01:33.045
today comin' out
of your mom's vagina.

01:01:34.923 --> 01:01:37.466
Here we go!
Time for the baby!

01:01:37.634 --> 01:01:39.593
Breathe, breathe.

01:01:39.761 --> 01:01:42.388
Come on, come on!

01:01:42.556 --> 01:01:44.181
You can do it, baby!

01:01:44.349 --> 01:01:46.809
- Why don't you step into the tub?
- I'm wearing a suit.

01:01:46.977 --> 01:01:49.017
Well, you can strip down
to your undies if you wish.

01:01:49.041 --> 01:01:50.313
I'm not wearing any underwear.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.358
- Barry.
- Barry, will you just get in the G-D tub!

01:01:54.526 --> 01:01:57.653
Yes sir.

01:01:59.323 --> 01:02:02.658
Agh-hh!

01:02:02.826 --> 01:02:06.037
Yep, no recollection
of that place whatsoever.

01:02:08.915 --> 01:02:10.166
Wait, I forgot something!

01:02:14.546 --> 01:02:16.380
Push.

01:02:16.548 --> 01:02:19.842
Okay, mirror. Carol,
could you give me the mirror?

01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:23.137
Great. Let me see
if that's right.

01:02:23.305 --> 01:02:24.680
What the hell is this?

01:02:24.848 --> 01:02:27.266
It's whales in the ocean.

01:02:27.434 --> 01:02:28.934
It's supposed to be soothing.

01:02:29.102 --> 01:02:31.228
Right?

01:02:35.025 --> 01:02:37.860
What?
What are you saying?!

01:02:38.028 --> 01:02:41.030
- I can't hear you!
- Just reach down. Just reach down.

01:02:44.743 --> 01:02:46.577

01:02:46.745 --> 01:02:48.913

- Happy thoughts.

01:02:49.081 --> 01:02:50.706
That's it.

01:02:50.874 --> 01:02:53.234

- I can't do any more!

01:02:53.258 --> 01:02:55.008

Say hello to your little girl.

It's a girl.

01:03:40.424 --> 01:03:43.050
Just follow the baby.
You can never go wrong.

01:03:43.218 --> 01:03:44.635
You were right.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.388
You were right.

01:03:47.556 --> 01:03:49.473
She's beautiful.

01:03:49.641 --> 01:03:51.725
- Wanna hold her?
- Yeah.

01:03:55.021 --> 01:03:56.772
I got her. I got her.
I got her.

01:03:59.734 --> 01:04:01.986
Okay.

01:04:04.489 --> 01:04:06.198
Christmas.

01:04:50.702 --> 01:04:52.119
How's she doin'?

01:04:52.287 --> 01:04:55.831
I just came in here to...
Ginger was watchin' some videos.

01:04:55.999 --> 01:04:58.167
I just wanted to turn it off.

01:05:01.838 --> 01:05:03.130
Thanks for stayin' the night.

01:05:03.298 --> 01:05:05.591
I know you had your graduation.

01:05:05.759 --> 01:05:08.427
It's just a sheet of paper.

01:05:08.595 --> 01:05:12.264
Yeah, well, Ginger appreciates it,
so congratulations.

01:05:12.432 --> 01:05:15.184
You know, we've never had
much time alone together, Barry.

01:05:15.352 --> 01:05:17.192
- Why are you doing this?
- Does it still work?

01:05:17.354 --> 01:05:19.855
- What are you doing?
- Relax, I’m a professional, remember?

01:05:20.023 --> 01:05:22.024
I knew it. Stop!
I knew it.

01:05:22.192 --> 01:05:23.526
That was you at the Beaver Tree.

01:05:25.904 --> 01:05:28.489
What is it? ls it that
you just don't like me?

01:05:28.657 --> 01:05:31.450
- Or are you jealous?
- No, please.

01:05:31.618 --> 01:05:32.910
Of you?

01:05:33.078 --> 01:05:34.954
I don't know.

01:05:35.121 --> 01:05:37.456
Ginger?

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:40.167
Is it really that boring being

01:05:40.335 --> 01:05:42.086
everybody's favorite
all the time?

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:47.341
What are you two doing up?

01:05:49.928 --> 01:05:52.054
Look who I found
in here watching boobs.

01:05:53.723 --> 01:05:55.015
Pervert.

01:05:58.603 --> 01:06:00.312
I’m gonna go to bed.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.619
Okay, get a little...
a little drink of water.

01:06:15.787 --> 01:06:17.997

01:06:19.082 --> 01:06:21.417
Sweet girl.

01:06:21.585 --> 01:06:23.252
Right there.

01:06:24.879 --> 01:06:26.964
It's broken.

01:06:27.132 --> 01:06:28.757
I see.

01:06:28.925 --> 01:06:31.260
Well.

01:06:31.428 --> 01:06:33.137
You a daddy?

01:06:33.305 --> 01:06:35.306
Yeah.

01:06:35.473 --> 01:06:36.849
Fantastic.

01:06:37.017 --> 01:06:38.350
Let's see the little bugger.

01:06:38.518 --> 01:06:40.102
Okay.

01:06:41.187 --> 01:06:42.563
Now look at that...

01:06:42.731 --> 01:06:44.148
half-Asian.

01:06:44.316 --> 01:06:45.941
Excuse me?

01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:49.445
Your baby.
Oriental, right?

01:06:49.613 --> 01:06:51.155
I don't think so.

01:06:52.657 --> 01:06:54.199
Been in this park over 30 years,

01:06:54.367 --> 01:06:57.828
seen every baby
from red to blue to Tyler too.

01:06:57.996 --> 01:07:01.123
Eyes, hue of skin...

01:07:01.291 --> 01:07:02.958
nothing like Japanese skin.

01:07:03.126 --> 01:07:04.835
Damn soft, too.

01:07:05.003 --> 01:07:07.087
Velvet.

01:07:07.255 --> 01:07:09.048
Mm-mm-mm...

01:07:15.805 --> 01:07:19.058
Hey, man, can I help you?

01:07:19.225 --> 01:07:20.309
Sorry.

01:07:20.477 --> 01:07:21.477
What?

01:07:21.645 --> 01:07:22.811
Sorry.

01:07:22.979 --> 01:07:24.688
Why are you sorry?

01:07:24.856 --> 01:07:27.691
- Sorry.
- Why are you s...

01:07:43.958 --> 01:07:45.834
Mom, do you think
Cornelia looks like me?

01:07:46.002 --> 01:07:47.795
Yes, I do.

01:07:47.962 --> 01:07:49.588
Does she look like my father?

01:07:49.756 --> 01:07:51.882
No.
Neither do you.

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:53.884
I thought he was an ugly man.

01:07:54.052 --> 01:07:55.344
Why are you asking?

01:07:55.512 --> 01:07:57.179
I don't know.

01:07:59.516 --> 01:08:01.141
Where'd he come from?

01:08:02.811 --> 01:08:05.062
Your father came from
a place very far away,

01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:06.814
and he should've stayed there.

01:08:06.981 --> 01:08:10.025
He left behind the only part
of him worth knowing... you.

01:08:12.028 --> 01:08:14.655
Does my baby look Asian to you?

01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:18.075
This isn't about
Cornelia, is it?

01:08:18.243 --> 01:08:20.118
- This is about your testes.
- What?

01:08:20.286 --> 01:08:22.537
It's natural
after a loss like this

01:08:22.706 --> 01:08:25.207
to question, "ls it real?"

01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:27.876
Did I actually make
this little creature?"

01:08:28.044 --> 01:08:30.170
Questions are healthy.

01:08:30.337 --> 01:08:33.006
I think that's the main reason
you had the paternity test.

01:08:34.801 --> 01:08:38.554
Barry, God has his ways, kiddo.

01:08:40.098 --> 01:08:41.432
She is beautiful, isn't she?

01:08:41.599 --> 01:08:44.059
She's a Munday.

01:08:44.227 --> 01:08:46.060
Cornelia...

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:48.397
something-Munday.

01:08:48.564 --> 01:08:49.648
Just Cornelia.

01:08:50.649 --> 01:08:52.151
No middle name?

01:08:52.318 --> 01:08:55.529
No middle name, no last name.
Just Cornelia.

01:08:57.073 --> 01:08:59.233
You have to have a last name.
That's illegal, isn't it?

01:08:59.256 --> 01:09:02.411
What about Jesus,
Madonna, or Calvin?

01:09:02.578 --> 01:09:04.412
Who's Calvin?

01:09:04.581 --> 01:09:06.874
I don't know.

01:09:11.755 --> 01:09:14.756
- What are you doing?
- Nothin'.

01:09:14.924 --> 01:09:17.091
Fine.

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:21.095
Listen, Cornelia's sleeping,
but you're gonna have to feed her soon.

01:09:22.265 --> 01:09:23.765
Where are your glasses?

01:09:23.933 --> 01:09:26.100
I got contacts a month ago.

01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:28.228
You haven't noticed?

01:09:28.395 --> 01:09:31.064
Would you notice
if I had no head?

01:09:31.232 --> 01:09:33.108
Probably.

01:09:35.862 --> 01:09:39.113
See those guy's plants across the hall?
They're pretty sweet.

01:09:39.282 --> 01:09:41.492
My mom's number
is on the fridge.

01:09:41.658 --> 01:09:43.452
Are you sure
you can handle this?

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.287
Yeah.
We'll be fine.

01:09:45.455 --> 01:09:49.207
I got beer.

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:51.335
Are you okay?

01:09:51.502 --> 01:09:53.170
I’m awesome.

01:09:59.844 --> 01:10:01.303
Br-rr-rr.

01:10:02.555 --> 01:10:03.555
Br-rr-rr.

01:10:07.644 --> 01:10:10.646
- Hello?
- Barry, it's Mom. Could you come over?

01:10:10.814 --> 01:10:12.231
Now?

01:10:12.398 --> 01:10:14.983
Just for an hour or so.
This damn disposal.

01:10:15.151 --> 01:10:16.777
I’m watching Cornelia, Mom.

01:10:16.945 --> 01:10:19.863
Bring her. She should be visiting
her grandmother, you know.

01:10:34.838 --> 01:10:37.756
- Hello.
- Barry, hi.

01:10:37.924 --> 01:10:39.508
I’m Dr. Preston Edwards.

01:10:39.676 --> 01:10:41.385
Please, don't be alarmed.

01:10:41.553 --> 01:10:42.886
Your mother's concerned.

01:10:43.054 --> 01:10:44.930
She loves you very much.

01:10:45.098 --> 01:10:47.724
I thought
you had a bad disposal.

01:10:47.892 --> 01:10:49.852
Barry, listen
to Dr. Edwards.

01:10:52.647 --> 01:10:54.147
Adorable.

01:10:54.315 --> 01:10:57.359
Barry, our group
provides support

01:10:57.527 --> 01:10:59.486
to help us understand
what has happened to us.

01:10:59.654 --> 01:11:02.489
Boys? Each of the men
in this room has suffered

01:11:02.657 --> 01:11:07.202
some kind of genital
mutilation or deformity.

01:11:08.538 --> 01:11:10.122
You're not alone.

01:11:11.624 --> 01:11:14.209
Hi, I’m Jerry Sherman.

01:11:14.377 --> 01:11:17.087
When I was 11 years old,

01:11:17.255 --> 01:11:19.756
my penis was completely severed.

01:11:19.924 --> 01:11:22.885
Now the end pokes out
like a little snappy turtle.

01:11:23.052 --> 01:11:26.555
And yes,
I do urinate sitting down.

01:11:26.723 --> 01:11:30.642
But you know what?
My testicles are intact.

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:33.395
So, I'd say
my glass is half full.

01:11:34.814 --> 01:11:36.648
Well done, Jerry.

01:11:40.653 --> 01:11:42.070
My name's Kyle Pennington.

01:11:42.238 --> 01:11:45.407
I’m 37. I have a master's
degree in education.

01:11:45.575 --> 01:11:48.201
My penis is 16 inches long.

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:52.706
It's thin like a rope,

01:11:52.874 --> 01:11:55.417
and my testicles
are the size of peanuts.

01:12:01.591 --> 01:12:03.926
I suffer from a rare
genetic disorder

01:12:04.093 --> 01:12:06.929
called Glassroth Syndrome.
I’m the founder of the group.

01:12:07.096 --> 01:12:08.722
Thank you, Kyle.

01:12:12.518 --> 01:12:14.770
If you're laughing
out of nervousness

01:12:14.938 --> 01:12:17.272
or embarrassment,
that's understandable.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.567
But there is nothing funny
about Kyle's condition.

01:12:20.735 --> 01:12:23.111
I’m sorry, Kyle.

01:12:25.448 --> 01:12:26.490
Ahem...

01:12:28.576 --> 01:12:31.078
My name is Maury...
Maury Knox.

01:12:31.245 --> 01:12:32.496
Maury is a new member.

01:12:32.664 --> 01:12:34.706
He prefers to speak
with his back to the group.

01:12:36.459 --> 01:12:39.419
I, um... actually, I have
no genitalia at all.

01:12:39.587 --> 01:12:42.506
My private spot is
a smooth hairless patch.

01:12:42.674 --> 01:12:44.633
And I pee out of my a-anus.

01:12:48.054 --> 01:12:50.430
This is my second meeting.

01:12:50.598 --> 01:12:52.432
Thank you, Maury.

01:12:57.897 --> 01:12:59.617
Barry, I know this
must seem strange to you.

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:01.608
No.
No, it's totally...

01:13:01.776 --> 01:13:03.151
it's cool.

01:13:03.319 --> 01:13:05.654
Came over with my baby
to my mom's house

01:13:05.822 --> 01:13:07.447
to help fix her disposal,

01:13:07.615 --> 01:13:10.367
and I find five dudes

01:13:10.535 --> 01:13:12.244
sitting in my living room

01:13:12.412 --> 01:13:14.172
waiting to tell me stories
about their dicks.

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:15.956
It's perfectly normal.

01:13:16.124 --> 01:13:17.708
Okay.

01:13:17.875 --> 01:13:20.293
Can I ask you a question,
Dr. Edwards?

01:13:20.461 --> 01:13:23.505
You ever find people
who figure out their own problems

01:13:23.673 --> 01:13:27.009
without the help
of a support group?

01:13:27.176 --> 01:13:30.262
Well, I have
patients who have

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:31.888
believed that
they have self-healed,

01:13:32.056 --> 01:13:34.349
only to have their problems resurface
in acts of violence,

01:13:34.517 --> 01:13:37.352
- estrangements, sexual confusion...
- Served it, sister.

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.354
Okay. Well hey,
I’m not violent,

01:13:39.522 --> 01:13:42.441
estranged or sexually confused,
so maybe I’m cured.

01:13:42.608 --> 01:13:45.736
Ha, no one is ever really cured.

01:13:45.903 --> 01:13:48.864
That's nice, Doctor,
but my balls are gone.

01:13:49.032 --> 01:13:51.450
And I don't think
your group discussions

01:13:51.617 --> 01:13:53.827
will help bring them back.

01:13:53.995 --> 01:13:56.204
I don't even know
if I want the damn things.

01:13:56.372 --> 01:13:58.332
The only good they ever did was
help make Cornelia

01:13:58.499 --> 01:14:01.019
and I don't even know
if they can honestly take credit for that.

01:14:01.043 --> 01:14:03.003
Thank you.

01:14:03.171 --> 01:14:05.047
Mini-breakthrough.

01:14:06.132 --> 01:14:07.632
You really should
join our group.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.760
It's Thursday nights
at 7:00.

01:14:09.927 --> 01:14:12.471
Jerry, are you
on refreshments this week?

01:14:12.638 --> 01:14:14.765
- I’m makin' puff pastry, Doc.
- Good times.

01:14:14.932 --> 01:14:17.532
Tell you what, why don't I just call you
when I'm feeling violent,

01:14:17.556 --> 01:14:18.977
estranged, or...

01:14:19.145 --> 01:14:20.771
Sexually confused?

01:14:22.065 --> 01:14:24.816
- Barry?
- Yes, Preston.

01:14:26.027 --> 01:14:28.320
All right. Fellas?

01:14:29.739 --> 01:14:31.114
Bye.

01:14:38.081 --> 01:14:40.916
Here's the one
I was looking for.

01:14:41.084 --> 01:14:44.628
This is Christmas.
You were four, I think.

01:14:44.796 --> 01:14:47.589
Yes.
I was fat.

01:14:49.258 --> 01:14:51.259
Look it, look it,
look it, look it.

01:14:53.971 --> 01:14:57.265
Look.
Yeah, see, she's got your eyes.

01:14:57.433 --> 01:14:59.518
She's got your nose.

01:14:59.685 --> 01:15:01.603
She's got your toes.
Look!

01:15:01.771 --> 01:15:03.563
Who has anyone's toes?

01:15:05.399 --> 01:15:07.859
You were such a good baby.

01:15:08.027 --> 01:15:10.320
You were always smiling
about something.

01:15:10.488 --> 01:15:12.572
Look at this.

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.420
I never could figure out
what was so funny,

01:15:14.534 --> 01:15:19.246
but you were always
smilin' about something or other.

01:15:25.628 --> 01:15:28.839
You know, it never
bothered you that we were poor.

01:15:29.006 --> 01:15:33.718
It never bothered you
that we were alone.

01:15:33.886 --> 01:15:36.179
I worried about you so much

01:15:36.347 --> 01:15:38.265
growing up without a father.

01:15:40.143 --> 01:15:42.936
I really don't think you missed him
until you were older.

01:15:44.605 --> 01:15:46.690
You know, until you...

01:15:46.858 --> 01:15:49.860
needed to ask questions about...

01:15:50.027 --> 01:15:52.070
you know, being a man.

01:15:52.238 --> 01:15:55.157
There wasn't
anybody there to ask.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:59.870
Life goes in circles, you know.

01:16:03.082 --> 01:16:06.001
Ginger's a good mother, Barry.

01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:08.670
I want you to take care
of that baby.

01:16:11.549 --> 01:16:14.509
Did he know
you were pregnant when he left?

01:16:14.677 --> 01:16:18.847
Barry, if I tell you he knew,

01:16:19.015 --> 01:16:20.599
you'll make yourself crazy

01:16:20.766 --> 01:16:22.851
wondering why he left.
If I say he didn't...

01:16:23.019 --> 01:16:24.936
I just want to know.

01:16:28.691 --> 01:16:30.692
I just want to know who I am.

01:16:40.036 --> 01:16:44.039
Yeah.

01:16:50.796 --> 01:16:53.924
Leaving behind a sperm
doesn't make you a father.

01:16:54.091 --> 01:16:56.551
Or a man...

01:16:57.553 --> 01:17:01.640
any more than one brick
makes a house.

01:17:02.642 --> 01:17:04.392
I know that.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.394
You've built your own house now.

01:17:06.562 --> 01:17:10.315
It's there, the circles.

01:17:14.237 --> 01:17:15.987
Before you had Cornelia,

01:17:16.155 --> 01:17:18.907
did you know there was love like this
in the whole wide world?

01:17:19.075 --> 01:17:22.077
Mm-um.

01:17:24.872 --> 01:17:27.415
Another guy said
he pees out of his anus.

01:17:35.549 --> 01:17:38.426
Now that's just bragging.

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.266
Sometimes you remind me

01:17:44.433 --> 01:17:47.644
of Joey from
the first season of "Friends."

01:17:47.812 --> 01:17:49.813
Was he awesome?

01:17:51.148 --> 01:17:54.818
No.
I mean, kind of.

01:17:54.986 --> 01:17:58.613
I liked it.
I liked him on that.

01:17:58.781 --> 01:18:01.658
He was funny.

01:18:12.295 --> 01:18:14.963
Were you really a virgin
before our sex?

01:18:16.007 --> 01:18:18.425
Did you think
I was lying to you?

01:18:19.885 --> 01:18:22.345
You don't remember
that night at all?

01:18:29.395 --> 01:18:31.646
That sucks.

01:18:31.814 --> 01:18:33.565
Hey, why me?

01:18:33.733 --> 01:18:35.108
I mean, that night,

01:18:35.276 --> 01:18:37.986
why... why with...

01:18:38.154 --> 01:18:40.488
with me?

01:18:44.327 --> 01:18:45.910
M-most of my life,

01:18:46.078 --> 01:18:48.121
I think, you know,
people never really

01:18:48.289 --> 01:18:49.622
paid much attention to me.

01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:52.250
They kinda just forgot about me.

01:18:52.418 --> 01:18:55.003
I mean, they would think
like, "What's the point?"

01:18:55.171 --> 01:18:59.424
Or they would just look at me and think,
"Why bother?" You know?

01:18:59.592 --> 01:19:02.177
And people I work with,

01:19:02.345 --> 01:19:04.637
my family,

01:19:04.805 --> 01:19:07.932
and, um, so...

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.310
I don't know, I found
kind of a safety in that...

01:19:10.478 --> 01:19:12.729
like, that there was
no judgment then.

01:19:12.897 --> 01:19:15.398
No overt judgment.

01:19:15.566 --> 01:19:17.942
You mean, you...

01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:21.821
you dress like this
on purpose, and you know.

01:19:21.989 --> 01:19:25.408
Well, I don't expect you
to understand it,

01:19:25.576 --> 01:19:27.786
but there is kind of a...

01:19:27.953 --> 01:19:30.955
a power in being...

01:19:31.957 --> 01:19:33.708
undesirable.

01:19:35.544 --> 01:19:39.089
But then I almost got
in this car accident that day...

01:19:39.256 --> 01:19:41.049
the day of the night...

01:19:41.217 --> 01:19:44.010
and this guy yelled
out his window...

01:19:44.178 --> 01:19:46.471
Watch where you're going,
you ugly bitch!

01:19:46.639 --> 01:19:50.225
And, um, and it just
took it all away,

01:19:50.393 --> 01:19:54.729
just that one sentence.
And I just felt really...

01:19:54.897 --> 01:19:57.690
like an ugly bitch.

01:20:02.738 --> 01:20:05.156

I just talked to Tom Farley
this morning.

01:23:26.817 --> 01:23:28.901

Yes. Thank you.

By the way,
I need you to stay late tonight.

01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:37.744
Martin Lefleur
is supposed to call

around about
6:00 or 6:30.

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:42.373
I need you to walk him through
the proposal. Cool?

01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:46.002

01:24:16.825 --> 01:24:18.451

01:24:18.619 --> 01:24:19.939

it's the good stuff,

01:24:20.079 --> 01:24:21.663

and had a little sip.

01:26:35.506 --> 01:26:38.966
I impregnated one of
the last random women I conquered

01:26:39.134 --> 01:26:42.762
before my testicles vanished
from the face of this earth.

01:26:42.930 --> 01:26:44.263
I never stopped to consider

01:26:44.431 --> 01:26:46.682
whether she would be
a good mother for my child,

01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:48.850
or even whether I’d be able
to sit in the same room

01:26:48.894 --> 01:26:50.978
with the woman
after the sex act was complete.

01:26:53.649 --> 01:26:54.690
And yet somehow,

01:26:54.858 --> 01:26:56.818
through this disconnected
senselessness,

01:26:56.985 --> 01:27:00.655
I set in motion
a chain reaction of happiness.

01:27:00.823 --> 01:27:02.532
Now it's hard for me to believe

01:27:02.699 --> 01:27:04.826
I never would've
chosen this life.

01:27:04.993 --> 01:27:07.203
And I sometimes think
of the days

01:27:07.371 --> 01:27:11.165
I was buried in my cave,
feeling sorry for myself,

01:27:11.333 --> 01:27:13.501
Letting my hand
drift between my legs

01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:16.295
to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

01:27:16.463 --> 01:27:19.590
But I also remember getting that letter
from Newton Creech

01:27:19.758 --> 01:27:21.843
and reading every word twice.

01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:23.845
Before I could even
think about it,

01:27:24.012 --> 01:27:26.764
before I could even
poison the reaction,

01:27:26.932 --> 01:27:28.641
I was overjoyed...

01:27:28.809 --> 01:27:31.519
overjoyed at the idea
of a new life,

01:27:31.687 --> 01:27:33.312
