00:02.936 --> 00:03.669
Chicago police intelligence.

00:03.671 --> 00:05.270
Do you want to keep
answering phones?

00:05.272 --> 00:06.538
I want to be a chicago
police officer.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.707
Let's do it then.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.642
- You passed.
- I did?

00:12.313 --> 00:14.446
Hello.

00:17.084 --> 00:18.517
- Where's nadia?
- Straight to voicemail.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.054
We may have a hit
on the car.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.207
It's south of
the broadway bridge.

00:25.208 --> 00:26.357
(amaro)
hey, sarge?
We got her.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.313
Hey.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.084
So the memorial stone's
in motion,

01:25.086 --> 01:28.187
And the etching's gonna go
around the side of the building.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.555
I'm just waiting on
the go-ahead

01:29.557 --> 01:31.356
- From the ivory tower.
- Thanks for taking the lead

01:31.358 --> 01:33.425
On this, sarge.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.327
I keep wanting
to buzz up there,

01:35.329 --> 01:38.530
Do our usual noon-time
visit to the fat box.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.133
You know,
the vending machine.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.835
That's what they call it
in england.

01:42.837 --> 01:44.436
Nadia read about it.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.639
[crying]
i keep touching up my mascara
every ten minutes.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.142
- I gotta get upstairs.
- Okay.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.617
[exhales]
[softly] damn.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.586
Yeah.
We're all feelin' it.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.421
Girl was going places,
man.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.156
Hey.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.259
Go grab some coffee.
We got this.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.863
It's just a desk,
right?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.707
How you holding up?

02:21.709 --> 02:24.576
Same as everyone else,
i guess.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.680
Anybody we should be
sending her stuff to?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.149
Uh...Her dad's in indianapolis.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.850
I'll make sure
and get it to him.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.819
(voight)
all right,
fischer just called.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.355
Needs us in tri-taylor.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.703
- Hey, antonio.
- Hey.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.639
- Sergeant.
- Cruz.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.440
What the hell
happened here?

02:55.442 --> 02:57.309
Bomb went off
at 8:42 a.M.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.178
We're clear for radiation.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.480
At least four injured,
two pretty bad shape.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.848
Two fatalities.
One female.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.616
One looks like a male.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.918
How's that?

03:05.920 --> 03:07.953
We're still putting him
back together.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.855
(antonio)
any idea what caused this?

03:09.857 --> 03:11.623
Ied of some sort.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.293
We found screws in buildings
all the way down the street.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.295
Thanks.

03:17.932 --> 03:20.732
So where were you standing
when it went off?

03:22.736 --> 03:24.503
You're the police?

03:24.505 --> 03:25.504
Yeah, that's right.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.806
Gimme a sec.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.542
Do you live around here?

03:32.246 --> 03:33.845
Did you see something?

03:33.847 --> 03:35.214
Come on, isabella.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.482
She's 12.
Got a vivid imagination.

03:37.484 --> 03:40.452
Let this man do his job.
Come on.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.423
How many times have i told you
not to talk to cops?

03:49.563 --> 03:51.363
(ruzek)
hey, man.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.431
Were there any victims
taken to the hospital

03:52.433 --> 03:54.433
- Before we got here--
- my wife.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.001
Have you seen her?
Nobody will tell me anything.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.836
Sir, we're still trying
to clear the scene,

03:57.838 --> 03:59.571
But we can take your name,
information.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.607
Mason. Uh, brahmer.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.275
We--we own the cafe,
my wife and i.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.977
Okay.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.578
Oh, my god, elizabeth.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.713
Go ahead and ride
with your wife.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.848
(atwater)
nobody saw anything.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.817
It was an explosion.
Lot of glass.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.018
Same inside.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.820
Then we'll keep
knocking on doors.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.887
Hey, al, you and ruzek
go question the husband

04:16.890 --> 04:19.458
Once he calms down.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.310
[knocking]
police.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.547
Detective halstead,
chicago pd.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.049
- Yeah, we met.
- If you wouldn't mind,

04:44.051 --> 04:46.852
I just want to talk to your
daughter for a quick second.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.021
She didn't see anything.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.922
Two people died
in that bombing, ma'am.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.059
- Mom?
- Get back in your room

04:54.061 --> 04:55.961
And finish getting ready.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.462
Now!

04:58.732 --> 05:01.300
Last year,
a kid in isabella's school

05:01.302 --> 05:02.801
Testified
in a gang shooting,

05:02.803 --> 05:05.704
And a week later, he was found
with a bullet in his head.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.006
I get it--we're gonna put her
down as a confidential source.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.709
Oh, yeah? Are you gonna
give her a lollipop too?

05:10.711 --> 05:12.711
And the next thing you know,
she's compelled to testify,

05:12.713 --> 05:16.381
And when word gets around,
how am <i> i</i> gonna keep her safe?

05:16.383 --> 05:17.883
I can't afford
to move out of my place,

05:17.885 --> 05:20.052
Let alone put her
in a new school and start over.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.586
I understand your concern.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.522
But how is your daughter
gonna feel

05:23.524 --> 05:25.557
Knowing that her mother didn't
let her help get the people

05:25.559 --> 05:27.693
Who did this?
I know she saw something,

05:27.695 --> 05:29.027
And i know she--

05:33.400 --> 05:35.434
Got started
on a sandwich bar.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.336
Now i'm making quiche
and crepes,

05:37.338 --> 05:39.338
European stuff i couldn't
even pronounce before.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.472
How long you been
working there?

05:40.474 --> 05:41.707
Eight months.

05:41.708 --> 05:42.941
Where were you when
the bomb went off?

05:42.943 --> 05:44.609
The kitchen.
I threw out an order,

05:44.611 --> 05:46.578
I rang the bell
and a second later...

05:46.580 --> 05:47.713
Boom.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.481
How's ms. Brahmer
holding up?

05:49.483 --> 05:50.716
She's got some fighting
to do.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.884
I owe a lot to those two.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.420
The brahmers know about
your priors when they hired you?

05:55.422 --> 05:56.922
Absolutely, they did.
I came clean.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.890
I let them know
i did a little something

05:58.892 --> 06:00.692
When i was younger,
but i put it behind me.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.127
Armed robbery's
not a little something.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.862
Well, i learned from it.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.131
Well, so, having been
through this before, brandon,

06:06.133 --> 06:08.633
You'll remember, eventually the
cops get to the bottom of it.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.736
I had nothing to do with
blowing that place up.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.771
Period.
But i do know who might.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.473
So do you wanna
hear about it,

06:14.475 --> 06:16.808
Or you wanna keep wasting
your time looking at me?

06:16.810 --> 06:19.745
If you got something
to say, say it.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.413
This gangbanger
named k-trick's

06:21.415 --> 06:23.115
Been hanging around
brahmers for months.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.950
He comes around back
every week.

06:24.952 --> 06:28.053
Two days ago, brahmer goes
in the back to talk to k-trick.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.589
An hour later, brahmer's
suburban was destroyed.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.658
All right, i'm gonna
let ruzek know.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.628
Doctor said your wife
went into surgery?

06:36.630 --> 06:41.133
Yeah. I guess shrapnel came
close to hitting a major artery.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.435
Every second
is touch and go.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.705
Mr. Brahmer,
you were near the bomb

06:46.707 --> 06:48.507
When it went off, right?

06:48.509 --> 06:49.708
I work the kitchen.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.177
My wife runs
the front of the house.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.779
My cashier called in sick,

06:53.781 --> 06:56.748
So liz was wearing
a lot of hats today.

06:56.750 --> 07:00.452
Your cook mentioned somebody
by the name of k-trick.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.586
[sighs]

07:01.588 --> 07:03.588
Yeah. Him.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.557
What was the nature
of your relationship?

07:05.559 --> 07:08.894
He's been shaking me down
for protection money.

07:08.896 --> 07:12.831
Two days ago, i said
i wouldn't pay him as much,

07:12.833 --> 07:14.800
'cause this winter
really killed me

07:14.802 --> 07:17.769
Revenue-wise.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.172
He beat up my suv.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.109
So this k-trick
made threats on your life

07:24.111 --> 07:26.144
If you didn't keep up
payments.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.014
He never actually
said that specifically.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.749
He just...

07:30.751 --> 07:32.751
Said i'd regret it.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.887
We'll call it in.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.762
Hey, sarge.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.898
Sarge?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.533
This can't be right.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.602
- What's the matter?
- I just got an email

07:50.604 --> 07:52.771
Saying area central's

07:52.773 --> 07:54.573
Not approving
the purchase order

07:54.575 --> 07:57.809
For the engraving job
on nadia's stone.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.746
I am gonna attack somebody.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.248
Well, we can...
Pass a hat around,

08:03.250 --> 08:04.749
Collect the money
ourselves.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.618
We may need to push
the memorial a little, but--

08:06.620 --> 08:08.820
Oh, no, the only thing that's
getting pushed around here

08:08.822 --> 08:12.123
Is however wrote this--
right off a cliff.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.959
I got a cousin
that does stonework.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.827
He'll give it to us
on the cuff.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.597
I can't even believe what
i'm seeing here.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.233
Seriously, don't stress
yourself out, sarge.

08:21.235 --> 08:23.101
You got enough to worry about.
We all do.

08:23.103 --> 08:26.004
Stonecutting is what
your cousin does for a living?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.106
It's not some side job
he dabbles in?

08:28.108 --> 08:31.009
It's full-time, legit.
He turns down work.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.777
Okay, great--if you can
make that happen,

08:32.779 --> 08:34.145
I'll get to the bottom
of this.

08:36.717 --> 08:40.118
K-trick...Otherwise known
as kenny t. Reevis.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.254
He's a gangster disciple.
Not top of the pyramid,

08:42.256 --> 08:43.822
But he's got some corners.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.724
Brought up on racketeering
charges twice,

08:45.726 --> 08:47.125
But the cases fell through

08:47.127 --> 08:48.627
When the witnesses
dropped the charges.

08:48.629 --> 08:52.197
Finally got the analysis
on the ied back from bomb unit.

08:54.801 --> 08:57.168
Whoever built it
used a pressure cooker.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.204
They filled it with nails,
screws, glass,

08:59.206 --> 09:00.939
Some small-grade explosive.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.641
I think that's the same kind
those guys used

09:02.643 --> 09:03.875
For the boston marathon
bombing.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.577
Yeah, see, you hook it up
to a cell phone,

09:05.579 --> 09:07.679
And ka-blammo--
the shrapnel projects out,

09:07.681 --> 09:09.648
Shreds everything
in its path.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.150
It's nasty, nasty stuff.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.718
Halstead's working on
a witness.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.920
Little girl lives
across the street.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.087
Her mom shut it down
the first time,

09:16.089 --> 09:17.622
But he's gonna
go at her again, so...

09:17.624 --> 09:19.791
- No other witnesses?
- None willing to talk.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.060
No security cameras
in the cafe.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.795
All right, mouse,

09:23.797 --> 09:25.630
Run the victims
for domestic disputes,

09:25.632 --> 09:26.798
Orders of protection--

09:26.800 --> 09:28.934
Make sure none of them
was the intended target.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.102
The rest of you get
a bead on reevis.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.873
Frankie!

09:34.875 --> 09:36.308
Yeah, look who it is.

09:36.310 --> 09:39.644
- The celtic tiger himself.
- What's up, my man?

09:39.646 --> 09:40.912
This is my partner,
kim burgess.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.347
- How's it going?
- It's going.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.748
Did you get
my message?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.283
Yeah. I didn't check it,
though.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.019
We need a stone engraved
at the district.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.055
Most importantly,
it's gotta be done

09:50.057 --> 09:51.790
By tomorrow afternoon.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.326
Oh, wow. Listen,
i got three orders stacked up.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.661
Frankie, when's the last
time i asked you for a favor?

09:56.663 --> 09:58.663
The parking tickets
i made disappear...

09:58.665 --> 10:00.332
- Yeah, but--
- hey, look,

10:00.334 --> 10:03.602
We know it's short notice,
but...

10:03.604 --> 10:05.236
We lost a friend
unexpectedly.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.227
So could you please
help us out here?

10:12.228 --> 10:13.611
What the hell.
For my cousin,

10:13.614 --> 10:15.046
I'll move some stuff
around.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.049
Just let me know
what you want it to say.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.718
- Right.
- Oh...

10:25.726 --> 10:28.193
Her...
Sorry, i don't--

10:32.766 --> 10:35.634
Yeah, it's cool.
Just take your time, man.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.268
Thanks.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.375
Jay.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.777
Good to see you,
father mcclosky.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.779
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Yeah.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.981
I saw something
on the news the other night

10:49.983 --> 10:52.417
About the young woman
that worked in your district.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.918
Yeah.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.320
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.422
I'll say a mass
for her.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.659
Thanks, i...
I appreciate that.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.427
I really do.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.362
Is that why
you wanted to see me?

11:04.364 --> 11:07.365
Actually, uh...

11:07.367 --> 11:10.702
I was hoping you could
pull a few strings for me.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.904
Let's take a walk.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.788
You can do the talking.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.795
Kenny reevis?

11:39.366 --> 11:40.999
Yeah.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.967
Why don't we go
for a ride, man?

11:42.969 --> 11:44.469
I'm watching my son here.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.337
Well, is that his aunt,
his nanny?

11:46.339 --> 11:48.239
- I'm sure he's fine.
- Aunt.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.108
But i only got him
four days out of the month,

11:50.110 --> 11:51.943
So if you got something
to ask me, you ask me here.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.812
No. We gotta talk
down at the district, pal.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.481
I ain't going anywhere unless
you got an arrest warrant.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.049
You hear me?

12:02.355 --> 12:04.923
You picked the wrong cop
on the wrong day.

12:04.925 --> 12:08.359
I will slap bracelets on you
and drag you outta here

12:08.361 --> 12:11.496
In front of your son.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.331
You hear me?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.166
Get on your feet.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.741
Stacey!

12:22.743 --> 12:26.077
Keep an eye on jackson.
I'll be back.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.490
You know why teddy roosevelt
won the nobel peace prize?

12:38.492 --> 12:41.059
Russia and japan
were getting into it,

12:41.061 --> 12:43.161
And teddy was like,
"i gotta sit these fools down

12:43.163 --> 12:45.296
Before they blow
each other up."

12:45.298 --> 12:47.098
He also knew,
to make it stick,

12:47.100 --> 12:50.101
Both countries needed to
feel like they won something.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.003
That's how i operate.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.072
Brahmer and i--
we had a nice deal.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.974
He kicked me down
a little cash,

12:55.976 --> 12:57.776
And i'd watch out for him.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.179
He misses a payment,

13:01.181 --> 13:05.316
And i blow up his restaurant
and kill a bunch of people?

13:05.318 --> 13:08.086
That ain't win-win.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.854
That ain't me.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.956
Ask around.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.957
We did.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.859
We know
you demolished his car

13:14.861 --> 13:17.228
And told him he was gonna
regret not paying you

13:17.230 --> 13:18.897
Two days ago.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.365
And you're gonna try
and convince me

13:20.367 --> 13:21.966
That those are actions

13:21.968 --> 13:23.835
That are even in
the same universe

13:23.837 --> 13:25.937
As blowing up a building?

13:25.939 --> 13:28.873
I don't need
to convince you.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.243
Prosecuting attorney
just needs to convince a jury.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.345
Oh, man.

13:35.515 --> 13:38.383
Kenny, let's say
it wasn't you, right?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.019
You were born and raised
in the neighborhood.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.387
Damn straight.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.923
You probably didn't like
getting pushed out.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.090
You ever lose
your neighborhood

13:46.092 --> 13:47.325
To a bunch of rich people?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.360
Why didn't you leave?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.062
'cause it's my block!

13:51.064 --> 13:52.463
Okay,
so it's your block...

13:52.465 --> 13:55.033
You know who blew up
the cafe.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.368
Give us a name.
We get help with the case.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.103
You get off
without a murder charge.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.206
That's a win-win
situation, baby.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.109
Nobody i know.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.151
Hey.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.086
Send a photo of reevis
over to halstead.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.988
See if he can get it
in front of his witness.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.489
Yeah.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.391
Erin.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.897
- How you holding up?
- I'm fine.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.966
I just wish everyone
would stop asking me.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.235
I'm not everyone.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.639
I miss her.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.140
Like everybody else,
i'm here.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.542
I'm doing my job.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.878
Job part
i'm not worried about.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.581
Don't let this turn into
a banana peel for you,

14:43.583 --> 14:46.184
And i think you know
what i'm talking about.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.353
Come too far.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.991
I hear you.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.898
So we looked into the guy

14:59.900 --> 15:02.400
That actually owns the building
that got bombed.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.902
Graham norcross.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.970
Guy's got ten lawsuits
hanging over his head,

15:05.972 --> 15:07.238
Each one a different tenant

15:07.240 --> 15:09.274
Claiming he strong-armed them
out of his properties.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.942
He throws a single
mother of three

15:10.944 --> 15:12.343
Out on the street
and sells the place

15:12.345 --> 15:13.645
For twice what he bought for.

15:13.647 --> 15:16.014
Big jump--
bombing your own property.

15:16.016 --> 15:19.050
Worth a conversation
at least.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.985
Well, go talk to him.

15:20.987 --> 15:23.221
[knocking]
mr. Norcross.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.423
Detectives dawson
and...Orbinsky?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.058
That's close enough.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.193
Glad you came.
Had you on my call sheet.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.945
Oh, yeah, you were
calling us?

15:30.946 --> 15:32.696
Yeah. I was hoping to get
addresses for the victims.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.432
I'd like to send
some flowers over.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.401
That's nice of you.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.436
We can't give out
their information yet.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.071
It was terrible getting
that call this morning.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.372
When you get any updates,

15:41.374 --> 15:42.941
I'd appreciate you
passing them along.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.175
You've evicted
a number of tenants

15:44.177 --> 15:45.476
From the buildings
you purchased.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.478
That's correct?

15:47.480 --> 15:50.615
Should i have my legal
counsel join us?

15:50.617 --> 15:53.051
Does he need to be here?

15:54.387 --> 15:56.387
- You tell me.
- We're just here

15:56.389 --> 15:58.990
For some background,
mr. Norcross.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.559
A tenant four doors down
from today's bombing site

16:01.561 --> 16:04.696
Had to leave her residence
because of an electrical fire.

16:04.698 --> 16:06.431
That's at 2315 rockefeller.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.334
She says you were responsible
because the building went up

16:09.336 --> 16:12.403
A day after your crew was inside
working on the wiring.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.405
Arson is difficult to prove.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.007
And there are witnesses
who state

16:16.009 --> 16:18.676
That the tenants in question
were stealing electricity,

16:18.678 --> 16:20.445
Endangering
their own family.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.580
But as that is
a pending legal matter,

16:22.582 --> 16:25.383
I obviously
can't comment further.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.986
You know one of the victims
had their limbs blown off?

16:27.988 --> 16:29.253
This is in your building.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.055
How 'bout you don't
hide behind your lawyer

16:31.057 --> 16:33.424
And help us out
on this one?

16:33.426 --> 16:37.061
Jamie weston.
She'll be happy to facilitate

16:37.063 --> 16:38.730
Any further questions
you may have.

16:43.069 --> 16:46.204
Nice. Classy.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.578
Commander.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.413
I've left you, like,
ten message.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.448
I wanted to tell you
in person.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.151
Wow, i don't like the sound
of this already.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.652
Now, it's not just
the purchase order.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.121
George baumgartner--

17:03.123 --> 17:06.124
He won't approve the stone
for nadia at all.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.191
That's...Unacceptable.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.526
I'm sorry.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.127
They don't think
it's appropriate

17:10.130 --> 17:12.530
Since she wasn't a cop.
Hey, if it was up to me,

17:12.531 --> 17:14.132
That stone would be done
already.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.700
Cover the desk, garcia.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.502
You got it, sarge.

17:17.503 --> 17:19.404
Trudy!

17:26.479 --> 17:28.546
Look, nadia decotis
wasn't a cop.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.281
If we put up a stone
commemorating her,

17:30.283 --> 17:31.749
The next thing you know,

17:31.751 --> 17:33.317
The janitor's gonna be
asking for one.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.652
Now, what kind of precedent
would that set?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.687
The precedent
that we memorialize

17:36.689 --> 17:38.289
Those we lose in our district.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.224
It doesn't matter whether
she wore tin or not!

17:40.226 --> 17:41.426
It matters to some people.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.278
It matters to the people
i answer to.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.129
Do you know what happened
to her in new york, george,

17:45.131 --> 17:46.264
What she went through?

17:46.266 --> 17:49.233
I do, and it's horrible.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.302
[sighs]

17:51.304 --> 17:53.371
I'll tell you what,
let's put a pin in it for now,

17:53.373 --> 17:55.139
Maybe revisit the issue
next month.

17:55.141 --> 17:57.275
No way! I know how it
works around here.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.377
It just keeps getting
kicked down the line.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.612
Nadia made the ultimate
sacrifice,

18:01.614 --> 18:03.381
And she deserves
a memorial stone

18:03.383 --> 18:05.383
At the 21st district,

18:05.385 --> 18:07.685
Or i will stand up

18:07.687 --> 18:09.520
At the next fop meeting

18:09.522 --> 18:11.189
And i will tell everybody

18:11.191 --> 18:15.460
That <i> you</i> blocked her from
getting the honor she deserves.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.698
The answer's no.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.734
And don't threaten me
again.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.278
[knocking]

18:35.615 --> 18:39.183
- Leave.
- Not until you hear me out.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.821
I'm gonna call the cops.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.691
You'd be calling me,
essentially.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.295
King of cross academy.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.831
Full scholarship
for isabella.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.505
Just wanna ask her
a couple of questions.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.441
Show her a photo.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.676
[paper rustling]

19:05.678 --> 19:07.178
She doesn't testify.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.813
Absolutely not.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.188
I was waiting outside
while my mom got coffee,

19:17.190 --> 19:19.190
And this guy came in
with a blue backpack.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.692
I remember it, 'cause
my friend's got the same one.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.829
But when he came out,
it was gone.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.333
Okay. Is this the man
you saw?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.701
That's not him.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.237
The guy i saw
was white with a beard.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.375
Okay. Do you remember
anything else about him?

19:37.377 --> 19:40.778
His right hand--he had scars
all over it.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.446
That's it.

19:42.448 --> 19:43.848
That's enough.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.851
Okay.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.320
Thank you so much,
isabella.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.588
You're welcome.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.828
I cross-referenced all recent
parolees in tri-taylor

19:57.830 --> 19:59.597
And the surrounding areas
with their known identifiers.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.299
Yep,
and we got sam carden.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.633
Did a little time
in statesville

20:02.635 --> 20:05.269
For assault and battery
and a couple weapons charges.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.605
The scars on his right hand's
from burns he got

20:07.607 --> 20:10.208
Working as an electrician.
Parole officer said he's been

20:10.210 --> 20:11.776
Picking up day jobs
here and there,

20:11.778 --> 20:13.778
But apparently he had
a hard time going straight.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.680
He do any work for
or got any beef

20:15.682 --> 20:17.915
- With norcross or brahmer?
- I say we go ask him.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.384
His parole officer said he lives
right on the south side.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.220
Go.
Have everyone who's free

20:22.222 --> 20:23.588
- Meet you there for backup.
- Right.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.690
Like i said,
i'm constantly checking in

20:25.692 --> 20:27.491
With my parolees,
and i've seen sam's pay stubs

20:27.493 --> 20:29.227
And he's been going to work.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.395
All right, believe me,
if he was up to something,

20:31.397 --> 20:32.630
I'd know about it.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.298
All right.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.237
Go ahead.

20:40.974 --> 20:43.841
Oh. Huh.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.444
I'd say he was up to something.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.746
Ha. Can't be everywhere
all the time, right?

20:53.686 --> 20:54.986
Oh!

20:56.723 --> 20:58.856
- [whistles]
- a few large right there.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.825
Yeah, i'd say.
That's a lot of money

21:00.827 --> 21:02.260
To have saved up after just
getting out of the joint.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.394
Yeah.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.595
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

21:04.597 --> 21:07.932
Should be contacting me
about 20 minutes or so.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.835
He normally uses the pay phone
downstairs, so...Yeah?

21:10.837 --> 21:12.270
Guess we'll just have
to wait and see.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.505
(atwater)
just keep an eye out
for carden.

21:14.507 --> 21:17.608
Copy that--we got eyes
on the front entrance.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.812
I still can't believe
you let me drive.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.814
It's my gift.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.718
Well, it's...From nadia.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.325
I told her how you said
you feel like a house husband

21:34.327 --> 21:36.460
Riding shotgun all the time.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.797
And she got all righteous
and she goes,

21:39.799 --> 21:43.067
"erin, you need to
let him drive a little."

21:45.872 --> 21:47.471
You know what we need?

21:47.473 --> 21:48.739
A kuma's night.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.742
Black sabbath burgers.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.779
That was nadia's spot,
right?

21:54.781 --> 21:56.080
Yeah.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.461
That's carden.

22:16.803 --> 22:19.003
Stop! Cpd!

22:23.776 --> 22:25.476
Gun!

22:29.816 --> 22:32.016
Out! Out, out, out, out!

22:32.018 --> 22:33.984
Freeze!

22:37.657 --> 22:41.392
5021 george, i got a carjacked
red pickup truck

22:41.394 --> 22:44.462
Heading north on the 7100
block of paulina.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.579
[horn honks]

23:04.984 --> 23:07.385
Halstead, location.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.754
On lake.
We'll cut him off at ashland.

23:09.756 --> 23:10.955
[horn honks,
tires screech]

23:10.957 --> 23:12.857
We're approaching ashland now.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.797
Don't move!
Don't move.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.732
Put your hands behind your back.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.603
[grunting]

24:32.605 --> 24:33.604
Let's go.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.239
Get up.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.977
Hey.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.546
It's gonna work out.

24:42.548 --> 24:44.682
Baumgartner's a bastard.

24:44.684 --> 24:47.017
He's a heartless bastard.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.752
And always has been.

24:48.754 --> 24:51.555
It's a piece of rock
on the front of the building.

24:51.557 --> 24:54.758
We can't even pay
our respects to her?

24:54.760 --> 24:58.229
It's times like this
when i-i...Hate this job.

24:58.231 --> 24:59.864
Trudy--

24:59.866 --> 25:02.500
You wanted to see us,
sergeant?

25:02.502 --> 25:04.001
Uh, yeah.

25:04.003 --> 25:07.171
Want you to swing by
second city storage,

25:07.173 --> 25:09.507
Locker number 8313.

25:09.509 --> 25:13.043
There's a file box labeled
"summer 2005."

25:13.045 --> 25:15.279
Pull the file for
operation angel.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.614
Bring it back here.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.649
All right.
Sure, got it.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.519
What's that about?

25:21.521 --> 25:23.654
It's all gonna work out.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.898
You got my jack too?

25:33.900 --> 25:36.700
That etd machine is good.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.769
Only takes seconds
to detect explosive material,

25:38.771 --> 25:41.672
Like the trace amount of
potassium nitrate

25:41.674 --> 25:42.873
On your jacket.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.241
We already got you
for the bombing.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.044
Just tell us
who hired you.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.680
Yeah. I'm really not
seeing a good reason to talk.

25:49.682 --> 25:52.249
Yeah, well, i can give you
a couple good reasons to talk.

25:52.251 --> 25:53.884
I'm going away
no matter what.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.920
I might as well go back
not a snitch.

25:55.922 --> 25:59.189
We found 3 gs in your room.
Probably more you already spent.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.659
Money didn't put itself in
there--means you got paid.

26:01.661 --> 26:04.261
You got it all figured out.
Why bother me?

26:05.631 --> 26:08.299
You could be looking at
two life sentences.

26:08.301 --> 26:09.833
Now, we can think of
a whole lot of ways

26:09.835 --> 26:11.702
To make that time easy
or hard.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.871
It's up to you.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.273
Yeah, you know what?

26:16.275 --> 26:18.676
I really don't care.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.678
It doesn't make
any difference.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.947
[thwack]

26:22.948 --> 26:25.215
He doesn't give up a name,
take him down to the cage.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.753
You two gonna
rough me up a little bit?

26:29.755 --> 26:30.888
Not gonna be any worse

26:30.890 --> 26:33.924
Than what you did to
those people at the cafe.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.660
Whatever.
It's out of my hands.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.267
Listen...

26:43.269 --> 26:45.669
Nobody out there
is in the mood

26:45.671 --> 26:48.205
To give your sorry ass
a break today.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.941
But if you give me a name...

26:50.943 --> 26:53.978
Life'll be a little better.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.649
Let me think about it.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.930
(halstead)
carden didn't have
a burner phone.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.798
He didn't call anybody
from that apartment

27:14.800 --> 27:17.167
Except his parole officer.
Never even wrote a letter.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.737
We should have his call
records from stateville

27:19.739 --> 27:21.071
Any minute.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.406
That was chicago med.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.808
Elizabeth brahmer
just passed away.

27:26.112 --> 27:28.345
What's up with carden?

27:28.347 --> 27:29.680
Giving him five minutes
to weigh his options.

27:29.682 --> 27:31.115
I think he's gonna go.

27:31.117 --> 27:34.018
Sam carden did a couple days'
work with melvin's electric

27:34.020 --> 27:36.654
Which does all the wiring
in norcross's buildings.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.055
A few months ago,

27:38.057 --> 27:39.923
Graham norcross
asked the county assessors

27:39.925 --> 27:41.725
For an updated property
value estimate

27:41.727 --> 27:44.028
On the brahmers' cafe.
It turns out the land

27:44.030 --> 27:46.030
Is worth four times
what it was when he bought it.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.065
The brahmers
have a ten-year lease.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.667
So if norcross
wanted 'em out...

27:49.669 --> 27:51.201
He'd either have to
cut 'em a check

27:51.203 --> 27:52.670
Or make them leave.

27:52.672 --> 27:56.140
So you hire someone who says
they can scare them out,

27:56.142 --> 27:57.808
But the device
over-delivers.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.810
Maybe norcross had carden
do the electrical fire

27:59.812 --> 28:01.679
Up the block too.

28:01.681 --> 28:04.248
Let's ask him.

28:07.319 --> 28:10.754
Son of a bitch.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.957
Call an ambo!

28:19.465 --> 28:23.000
- Ambo's two minutes out.
- Guys, he's not gonna make it.

28:23.002 --> 28:26.470
Who the hell
left the can in here?

28:52.398 --> 28:56.166
Just keep your mouth shut
until you talk to voight.

28:56.168 --> 28:59.036
Contact your fop rep.
Do it now.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.443
(roman)
wanna talk about it?

29:06.445 --> 29:08.078
What?

29:08.080 --> 29:11.982
How you walked out of
my cousin's shop.

29:11.984 --> 29:14.084
You noticed that?

29:14.086 --> 29:16.854
He's got a bell
on the door.

29:16.856 --> 29:22.226
My old district,
we had three deaths in one year.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.094
It was spooky.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.829
Naturally, you get people
who ask,

29:25.831 --> 29:27.197
And i don't lie when i say

29:27.199 --> 29:29.199
I never had a bad day
on this job.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.201
We chose it.

29:31.203 --> 29:34.071
And if i die
doing what i love,

29:34.073 --> 29:35.939
That's better than
croaking on a chicken bone

29:35.941 --> 29:38.976
Watching reruns
on the couch.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.812
Nadia chose this.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.947
We don't have time
to grieve.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.016
We keep pushing
and doing our jobs.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.185
We're not forgetting
the people we lost.

29:48.187 --> 29:49.353
We're honoring them.

29:49.355 --> 29:52.055
That's how i'd wanna be
remembered.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.492
Yeah.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.261
Maybe.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.429
[under breath]
8313.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.365
8313.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.873
Nice bike.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.985
Summer 2005.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.156
This is weird, right,
asking us to come down here?

30:26.158 --> 30:28.892
What's it got to do
with the memorial?

30:28.894 --> 30:31.962
I don't know, but i'd hate
to be this guy right now.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.033
(woman)
excuse me, gentlemen--

30:36.035 --> 30:37.868
What the hell is this?

30:37.870 --> 30:40.304
Turns out, mr. Norcross, we got
a little more to talk about.

30:40.306 --> 30:41.972
Fine. Through my attorney!

30:41.974 --> 30:44.241
Yeah. You can call her
after we process you

30:44.243 --> 30:45.843
- Down at the district.
- Process for what?

30:45.845 --> 30:47.444
You can do this voluntarily
or otherwise.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.179
I don't have a problem
with the second one.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.914
(norcross)
unbelievable.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.086
(olinsky)
three people dead.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.555
I don't say anything
until my legal team gets here.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.026
Like i told you,
after you've been processed.

31:02.027 --> 31:02.993
Didn't think we'd find out
about you and sam carden.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.027
Sam carden?

31:04.029 --> 31:06.563
He installed ceiling fans
in that cafe.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.298
I barely know the guy.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.234
Until you needed him
to take out the brahmers.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.436
I didn't take out
anybody.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.171
A few million sitting
on that property.

31:14.173 --> 31:16.874
Why worry about nice tenants
when you got condos to build?

31:16.876 --> 31:19.009
Yeah. People have killed
for a lot less.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.477
You're talking
out of your ass.

31:22.081 --> 31:24.014
It's real easy.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.350
You hired carden
to throw an m80 in there.

31:26.352 --> 31:27.651
You didn't know
he'd up the dosage

31:27.653 --> 31:29.386
About a hundred times
more than necessary.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.921
Most of this lands on him.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.055
[door opens]

31:32.057 --> 31:34.925
Let's talk outside.

31:36.929 --> 31:39.162
(mouse)
it's mason brahmer,
the owner of the cafe.

31:39.164 --> 31:41.131
(olinsky)
how come we didn't
find this earlier?

31:41.133 --> 31:44.001
Some people cover their tracks
better than others.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.003
Look, he spelled his name
one letter off on his id,

31:46.005 --> 31:48.972
Making it virtually impossible
to find anything on him.

31:48.974 --> 31:51.108
But i knew something
was wonky,

31:51.110 --> 31:53.377
So i kept trying different
versions until i found...

31:53.379 --> 31:54.645
"ross montag."

31:54.647 --> 31:56.647
Okay, see, he legally changed it
a few years back.

31:56.649 --> 31:58.148
Clearly, he didn't
want us finding out.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.316
So now i'm thinking,

31:59.318 --> 32:00.584
There's something up
with this guy, you know?

32:00.586 --> 32:02.619
People don't go changing
their names willy-nilly.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.154
So i ran the old names
backwards, forwards,

32:04.155 --> 32:05.688
Financials, everything,

32:05.691 --> 32:08.558
Until i found 250k
in one of his old accounts.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.327
It's a life insurance
settlement.

32:11.497 --> 32:15.365
The short version--
i think we got the wrong guy.

32:16.568 --> 32:19.403
Pick him up.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.572
[door slams]

32:26.178 --> 32:27.411
Why am i here?

32:27.412 --> 32:28.645
Because your first wife
died in a car accident

32:28.647 --> 32:30.380
Eight years ago
in portland.

32:30.382 --> 32:33.450
I want out of here now.
My wife passed away.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.285
- You have no right--
- her car burst into flames

32:35.287 --> 32:37.554
Because of a steering
fluid leak.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.190
Detectives
and the insurance company

32:40.192 --> 32:42.292
Liked you for it.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.395
But they couldn't
make the case.

32:45.397 --> 32:46.730
I'm giving you
one more chance.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.399
Don't make me
come in there.

32:49.401 --> 32:52.135
I'm asking you nicely.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.403
Just get straight with me now.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.405
I'll help you with
your statement.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.274
Go to hell.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.735
It was an accident.
I don't care

33:24.737 --> 33:27.137
What the portland cops
said.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.476
Then why'd you change
your name?

33:32.478 --> 33:34.144
I wanted a fresh start.

33:34.146 --> 33:36.213
Mm.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.682
See, i'm not buying
any of that.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.250
You're forgetting--
i was there

33:40.252 --> 33:41.752
When the bomb went off
at the cafe.

33:41.754 --> 33:44.054
Protected by a stainless
steel kitchen

33:44.056 --> 33:46.256
Where you knew the blast
wouldn't hit you.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.091
Okay, well, just because
you don't believe me

33:48.093 --> 33:50.127
- Doesn't mean i'm guilty.
- That is true.

33:50.129 --> 33:54.431
But what sam carden
is saying upstairs sure does.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.636
You gotta be pretty
desperate...

33:59.638 --> 34:01.638
To hire an ex-con

34:01.640 --> 34:03.407
Who's doing
electrical work for you.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.275
I don't even know
who that is.

34:05.277 --> 34:08.779
Why did you do it?
For the insurance money?

34:08.781 --> 34:11.648
Or you just hate women?

34:15.487 --> 34:17.420
That's for your wife
who died today.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.824
That's for your wife
you killed eight years ago.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.560
Stop!

34:25.531 --> 34:28.130
There's a big part of me

34:28.132 --> 34:29.699
Who wants to walk
outta here right now

34:29.701 --> 34:31.501
And let you take
the whole ride.

34:31.503 --> 34:34.804
But i dislike carden
even more than i dislike you,

34:34.806 --> 34:37.340
So i am giving you
this one shot.

34:37.342 --> 34:41.411
Tell me what happened,
a to z.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.679
If you don't...

34:43.681 --> 34:46.449
I go upstairs,
we go with carden's version.

34:46.452 --> 34:48.284
[sobbing]
i didn't do anything.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.152
I don't know who
sam carden is.

34:50.155 --> 34:51.420
Listen to me.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.690
If i walk outta here,

34:54.693 --> 34:57.294
That deal walks out
with me.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.372
All right!

35:09.374 --> 35:10.807
All right what?

35:13.345 --> 35:16.279
I'll give a statement.

35:25.524 --> 35:28.125
All right, i'll notify
the wife's family.

35:28.127 --> 35:30.827
- That's always a fun call.
- I'll call portland pd.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.295
It's gonna be such
a punch in the gut

35:32.297 --> 35:33.763
- After all these years.
- The family deserves to know

35:33.765 --> 35:36.199
What happened to their daughter.

35:36.201 --> 35:38.468
Atwood.
My office.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.643
Leaving that can in the room

35:46.645 --> 35:49.179
Almost caused us
the entire case, kevin.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.547
I understand, sarge.

35:50.548 --> 35:51.914
And i take full responsibility
for that.

35:51.917 --> 35:54.217
I appreciate that.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.289
Ia's gonna launch
a full investigation

35:59.291 --> 36:01.424
In the carden suicide,
though.

36:01.426 --> 36:03.827
I can't have you up here
while that's going on.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.262
What does that mean?

36:05.264 --> 36:07.898
I'm bumping you back down
to uniform.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.300
- It's just for a bit.
- Look, sarge,

36:10.302 --> 36:11.668
Whatever i gotta do--

36:11.670 --> 36:13.637
This isn't
a conversation, kevin.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.841
You wanted to see us,
sergeant?

36:17.843 --> 36:19.709
Yeah, we're shuffling
things around up here.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.646
Burgess, you're in intelligence
until further notice.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.481
Roman, you're partnered
with atwater.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.183
I cleared it with platt.

36:26.185 --> 36:28.518
Looking forward to it.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.488
Good. You're dismissed.

36:42.568 --> 36:43.967
Kevin.

36:43.969 --> 36:47.204
Kevin, this is not how
i wanted things to go down.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.573
I'm sure if you give voight
some time,

36:49.575 --> 36:51.875
- It'll all blow over.
- Burgess...

36:51.877 --> 36:53.510
Congrats.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.857
George.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.327
I don't approve some stone and
you think you can blackmail me?

37:10.329 --> 37:12.262
That's an ugly word.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.264
Who knows about this?

37:14.266 --> 37:15.832
Just the two guys
in this room.

37:15.834 --> 37:18.535
Or maybe the prostitute
i found you with.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.003
I don't know
if she remembers.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.504
- If this gets out--
- just sign the approval

37:21.506 --> 37:26.409
For nadia's memorial,
and we're done.

37:46.298 --> 37:48.465
Good to go.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.800
I could just kiss you,
hank.

37:50.802 --> 37:51.868
Thanks.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.704
Right back at ya, trudy.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.680
It turned out
real nice, roman.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.482
Thanks.

38:05.484 --> 38:06.750
Course.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.521
The, uh...

38:11.523 --> 38:13.323
Deputy chief sent this over.

38:13.325 --> 38:16.326
I figured i'd share it.

38:16.328 --> 38:18.595
"ms. Nadia decotis,

38:18.597 --> 38:21.865
"this letter is to commend you
on being accepted

38:21.867 --> 38:24.801
As a recruit to the chicago
police department."

38:27.839 --> 38:30.674
She would have made
a hell of a cop.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.442
Certainly
one of the bravest.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.597
Hey. I think we're all
gonna head to molly's.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.066
Pour one out for nadia.

38:56.068 --> 38:58.034
I think we could all
use a drink right about now.

38:58.036 --> 38:59.469
You in?

38:59.471 --> 39:02.339
Yeah. Yeah,
i'll try and make it.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.689
There's my girl.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.726
I was supposed to meet up
with everybody from work,

39:22.728 --> 39:25.662
But...I can't be
around them right now.

39:25.664 --> 39:28.131
Yeah. I get that.

39:28.133 --> 39:31.101
Times like this, you need
to be around family.

39:31.103 --> 39:36.106
Baby, i'm so sorry
you lost your friend.

39:44.883 --> 39:48.718
When i met nadia--

39:48.720 --> 39:50.987
When i busted her...

39:53.091 --> 39:57.026
I just saw something
in her.

39:57.028 --> 40:00.497
I wanted to be for her
what hank was for me.

40:02.734 --> 40:06.736
So i pushed her
in the direction i'd gone.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.474
But if i'd just left her
alone from the start,

40:11.476 --> 40:13.877
None of this
would have happened.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.748
I didn't lose her.

40:20.952 --> 40:23.119
I got her killed.
