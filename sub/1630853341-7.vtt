03:54.192 --> 03:57.654
you want a retrial? Hmm?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.989
It's not what I want.
It's what I need.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.574
I am not going to say
I killed Kathleen.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.202
(laughs)

04:07.705 --> 04:09.666
Jesus, Michael.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.209
Michael,
think of the money,

04:11.292 --> 04:14.963
the years you'll waste
fighting for this.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.214
I am not a moron.
I know the implications.

04:16.297 --> 04:19.258
-If we say these words--
-If I say them--

04:19.342 --> 04:21.886
If you say them,
no more prison.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.597
You want me to get up
and say I'm responsible
for the worst night of my life,

04:24.681 --> 04:26.182
that I'm responsible
for Kathleen's suffering?

04:26.265 --> 04:28.476
Did you listen
to what I read?

04:28.559 --> 04:30.186
We're saying you
didn't do anything wrong.

04:30.269 --> 04:32.313
Not until the very end
where I say

04:32.397 --> 04:33.648
I did everything wrong.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.402
I'm not going
to say I'm guilty.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.654
I can't.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.656
I want to avoid anything

04:41.739 --> 04:44.409
that puts your freedom
at risk.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.661
I want your kids
to stop worrying.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.871
They'll understand.
They, they'll support me.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.500
Mike, look around.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.294
This is all
the support you got.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.588
I told them not to come!

04:57.672 --> 05:00.383
Not to bother hearing
their father perjure himself!

05:00.466 --> 05:02.677
David Rudolf:
You could be
found guilty. Again.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.220
Michael Peterson:
Yeah, with what evidence?

05:04.303 --> 05:06.472
Everything the DA had is
inadmissible or compromised.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.017
Except for
your lies, Michael.

05:09.100 --> 05:09.308
Your character.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.021
Those are still in play.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.400
You can't walk back
from deceit.

05:18.317 --> 05:19.819
From how people see you.

05:22.613 --> 05:23.865
I'm not taking the plea.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.284
I won't do it.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.089
Class is going well.

05:40.173 --> 05:44.093
Um, the students seem
more attuned.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.599
I'm sorry, Sophie.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.350
My days don't provide
much inspiration.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.317
I'm, uh, returning to Paris.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.153
-Jean needs his muse.
-(Sophie chuckles)

06:02.236 --> 06:05.448
We're having trouble
with the third act.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.574
-Hmm.
-So...

06:10.036 --> 06:12.121
So when do you come back?

06:13.956 --> 06:17.001
I'm not, I'm not sure.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.253
We're hoping to finish
the film soon,

06:19.337 --> 06:20.421
but I don't know.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.173
It's hard to say when.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.302
Penny for your thoughts?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.850
Thoughts about what?

06:32.934 --> 06:35.812
Come on. About me.

06:36.687 --> 06:37.939
-(snickers)
-Us.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.149
This.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.067
Well, I'll go back
to Paris,

06:41.150 --> 06:43.861
and then I'll--
I come back

06:43.945 --> 06:45.530
and then, uh...

06:47.865 --> 06:48.991
That's all.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.660
Right. You come home
to Durham.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.913
I don't think Durham
will ever be home, Michael.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.499
You-you-you're
the only reason I'm here.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.501
Well, we'll figure it out.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.129
It'll be okay.

07:04.298 --> 07:07.760
Michael:
" Through her hand.
I feel the pulse of life,

07:07.844 --> 07:10.221
"of passion.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.809
"And I want all of her.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.352
"Her lips, her hair,

07:17.228 --> 07:19.564
"the skin I've yet to see.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.902
"But the fates
have denied the carnal.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.531
"Leaving me to be tempted
and contented by the spiritual,

07:28.614 --> 07:31.325
"the ethereal,
the simple purity

07:31.409 --> 07:33.077
"of her words and mind.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.163
But is that enough?"

07:37.957 --> 07:39.417
Came to me last night.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.837
Thoughts?

07:44.130 --> 07:46.632
(acoustic guitar playing)

07:49.969 --> 07:52.805
To Margie, my sister.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.640
I'm proud of you.

07:55.474 --> 07:58.227
I am almost 30.
I'm divorced.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.439
I'm using a cardboard box
as a table.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.481
(both chuckle)

08:02.565 --> 08:03.691
I'm proud of you
for leaving him.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.902
I know Lucas was a,
he was a good guy.

08:05.985 --> 08:06.527
He was the best guy.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.364
I hope he's okay.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.408
Yeah, see, you've got to

08:12.491 --> 08:14.368
take all of that energy
that you're putting

08:14.452 --> 08:16.370
on other people
and focus it on yourself.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.830
What do you mean?

08:17.914 --> 08:19.415
Well, when you finally start

08:19.498 --> 08:21.792
paying attention to yourself,

08:21.876 --> 08:23.252
you can't hide anymore.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.922
Okay. So what am I
ignoring here?

08:26.005 --> 08:27.089
Lucas used to say
the same shit.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.341
We've been through a lot,

08:28.424 --> 08:31.761
and you've never
really talked about it.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.054
You know, we've never--

08:33.137 --> 08:33.930
You can either let
the past haunt you

08:34.013 --> 08:36.432
or you move on.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.517
I can't change what happened.
You can't either.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.437
True. But I can try
to understand it.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.105
Why I felt like
something was wrong

08:43.189 --> 08:45.608
even before that night.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.777
And that's why,
you know, I'm going to,

08:47.860 --> 08:48.945
I'm going to go back home.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.365
What do you mean
go home?

08:56.744 --> 08:57.453
Just tell me what
you're talking about.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.125
I've saved up almost
enough money to go to Germany.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.086
I've been talking to Patty,

09:05.169 --> 09:06.170
and she still lives in
the same apartment complex

09:06.254 --> 09:08.297
that we grew up in.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.340
She says she can take me
to Mom's house

09:09.423 --> 09:11.467
and bring Agnes
over to talk.

09:11.550 --> 09:14.303
-You're going to Germany?
-Oh, Margie.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.305
I knew you would be pissed.
I knew it.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.308
And I don't want
to hide things from you.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.851
Well, then, next time,
just keep quiet

09:20.935 --> 09:22.937
about your bullshit
self-exploration.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.772
You know, you're supposed
to be helping me.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.149
And now I have to worry
about you again.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.276
Fuck! I always have
to keep an eye on you,

09:28.359 --> 09:30.778
and it's so fucking tiring

09:30.861 --> 09:32.697
because I'm always,
for years, worrying

09:32.780 --> 09:35.283
if you're high somewhere
or if you have a job

09:35.366 --> 09:36.158
or if you're going
to do something to yourself.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.911
Germany's going to help.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.664
Why do you care?
Why are you so mad?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.332
I mean, every time I talk
about when we were kids,

09:43.416 --> 09:46.002
you shut down,
just like Dad.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.795
Don't go.

09:49.588 --> 09:49.714
For me.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.217
Please.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.594
I'm sorry.
I have to.

09:56.887 --> 09:57.930
Fuck you.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.186
(sighs)

10:04.270 --> 10:05.146
(door slams)

10:17.450 --> 10:20.077
Hey, John, I want you
to come here a sec.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.787
Woman:
SBI is dirty.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.290
Given more time,
I can prove

10:24.373 --> 10:27.418
that consequential evidence
was withheld and misrepresented.

10:27.501 --> 10:30.463
I mean,
test results were hidden.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.133
Now, this man is serving
a life sentence,

10:34.216 --> 10:37.136
missing valuable time
with people he loves.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.639
Man:
So would Durham be
the focus here?

10:41.849 --> 10:43.559
-Definitely.
-Man: Let's get you down there.

10:43.642 --> 10:46.020
We need evidence
of misconduct and motive.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.773
You got to see this.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.654
Body's already in the morgue.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.041
Dr. Deborah Radisch:
My god.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.461
It's unbelievable.

11:20.846 --> 11:21.639
(cell phone chiming)

11:51.085 --> 11:52.545
Michael: (over phone)
Darling. How's Paris?

11:52.628 --> 11:53.838
Everything's good here.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.047
Michael: Fantastic.
How's the old man?

11:55.131 --> 11:57.883
Uh, Jean?

11:57.967 --> 12:01.637
Uh, stressed
but surviving.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.597
Michael:
Tell Jean I said hello.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.558
I'd love to see him
here sometime.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.560
Michael, I've got to go.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.353
Speak soon.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.230
Bye.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.070
Sophie Brussard:
I was surprised
to get your email.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.531
What email?

12:20.614 --> 12:21.699
About the homicide.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.118
Hmm?

12:24.201 --> 12:25.661
Injuries are congruent
with a beating.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.207
Radisch:
Okay. I don't know
who sent that to you,

12:30.291 --> 12:32.501
but it wasn't me.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.588
You have something
on your...

12:36.964 --> 12:38.924
Oh!

12:41.260 --> 12:43.471
So, a man was killed.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.055
Police are pursuing
a suspect.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.932
The newspaper's
writing about it.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.517
Seems like
there's clear motive.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.353
And
the murder weapon is
a heavy flashlight.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.272
So what's the connection?

12:53.355 --> 12:55.441
Cause of death is blunt
force trauma to the head.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.736
-It's a homicide.
-Okay.

12:58.819 --> 13:02.698
And there were no
skull fractures, which means...

13:02.781 --> 13:04.658
-No.
-...the nature of
Kathleen Peterson's death

13:04.742 --> 13:05.576
is no longer an anomaly.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.453
But all those autopsy reports.

13:07.536 --> 13:10.164
Every other beating case,

13:10.247 --> 13:11.874
they all had
skull fractures.

13:12.791 --> 13:13.876
Until now.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.216
You said there was motive.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.092
Officially,
robbery gone wrong.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.845
But Detective Holland thinks
the men knew each other.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.683
Sorry. Dr. Radisch,
can I show you something?

13:29.767 --> 13:30.726
Excuse me.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.401
(indistinct chatter)

13:53.290 --> 13:55.417
Rowe?

13:55.501 --> 13:56.919
Dr. Radisch:
Let's get ahead of it...

13:57.002 --> 13:59.213
It was Dennis Rowe?

13:59.296 --> 14:01.757
Ron Guerette: (over video)
Dennis Rowe. R-O-W-E.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.842
My sources say
he has a limp.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.178
A limp?

14:06.262 --> 14:08.472
Ron:
Says you had sex with him
four or five times.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.807
Oh, you're shitting me.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.561
-That's what he's claiming.
-Oh my god!

14:13.644 --> 14:14.603
Ron:
Rather know now than later.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.647
Michael:
Did he indicate where

14:16.730 --> 14:17.856
this great love affair
took place?

14:30.244 --> 14:34.665
(line ringing)

14:35.583 --> 14:36.875
-Jean: (over phone) Hello?
-Jean.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.172
(speaking French)

15:05.571 --> 15:07.323
Jean:
Wow. Okay.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.429
(Christmas music playing
over loudspeakers)

15:37.853 --> 15:41.357
♪ Used to laugh
and call him names ♪

15:41.440 --> 15:44.693
♪ They never let poor Rudolph ♪

15:44.777 --> 15:48.364

15:51.950 --> 15:54.787

15:58.957 --> 16:02.086

16:03.128 --> 16:03.170
(sighs)

16:06.590 --> 16:07.007
Kathleen Peterson:
I will take them.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.515
And, uh, I'll split it
on these two.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.558
You got it.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.396
So, uh, are you excited
for the holidays?

16:20.479 --> 16:23.190
Well, I was,

16:23.273 --> 16:24.733
but my boyfriend
and I broke up,

16:24.817 --> 16:26.819
and now I'm devastated.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.570
Oh! Before the holidays?

16:28.654 --> 16:30.906
God, some people are strange.

16:30.989 --> 16:31.782
I guess
it can be stressful.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.535
Well, apparently
he was so stressed,

16:34.618 --> 16:35.619
he had to fuck
other people.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.956
-It's complicated.
-Look up, please.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.253
My first husband, Fred,

16:44.336 --> 16:45.629
he used to lie all the time,

16:45.713 --> 16:48.132
and I was like,
"Never again.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.134
"Never again.
Give me the truth.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.301
The good, the bad,
and the ugly."

16:51.385 --> 16:53.887
You know what?

16:53.971 --> 16:55.931
The stories I make up
in my own head

16:56.014 --> 16:57.057
are far worse than reality.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.437
Makeup artist:
But you're married again?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.106
Yup. To a real piece of work.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.986
Yeah.
He's the strangest,

17:09.069 --> 17:13.115
most exciting person
I've ever met.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.199
That sounds great.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.075
-And impossible.
-That's it.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.162
It's always two things
with Michael.

17:18.245 --> 17:20.164
-Michael. That's his name?
-Yeah.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.790
Unless he's pulling
a long con.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.624
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

17:22.708 --> 17:24.960
So this watch is
$300 more?

17:25.043 --> 17:28.130
Yes. The diamonds
make it special.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.674
Yeah.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.885
Uh...

17:32.968 --> 17:34.762
Okay, well, I'm going to have
to go with the cheaper one,

17:34.845 --> 17:36.847
and I would love it
gift wrapped.

17:36.930 --> 17:36.972
Of course.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.059
Oh, you're shitting me.

17:42.811 --> 17:43.979
(cell phone ringing)

17:47.232 --> 17:48.358
Hello?

17:48.442 --> 17:50.652
Man: (on phone)
M.P. What is up, man?

17:52.237 --> 17:53.739
I'm sorry.
Who is this?

17:53.822 --> 17:54.656
Simon: Simon.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.951
-Your agent.
-Oh, Simon.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.119
Yes!

17:59.203 --> 18:00.412
Simon:
"Charlie Two Shoes."

18:00.496 --> 18:02.664
-Remember that old horse?
-Sure. I wrote it.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.917
Simon:
Yeah, right.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.293
Sorry. Anyways,

18:06.376 --> 18:07.169
I just got off the phone

18:07.252 --> 18:09.630
and I got
some really good news.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.192
Hey, Patty.

18:31.568 --> 18:35.823
Hello, Martha baby.
You've arrived.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.116
Oh, I trust
you traveled well.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.828
Airplanes are so fast.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.705
Thank you again
for having me.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.707
Of course.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.709
Once you're settled in here,
we can head over

18:47.793 --> 18:49.878
to your mother's house
this afternoon.

18:49.962 --> 18:50.170
Okay.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.386
It is so good to see you.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.929
Let's get you cleaned up.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.097
(speaking German)

19:30.460 --> 19:34.381
(somber music playing)

19:34.464 --> 19:35.799
You lit this match.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.052
Freda Black:
Son of a bitch
can't stop cheating.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.470
Now it's gonna burn.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.349
Hi. Freda Black?

19:45.517 --> 19:46.351
My name's Evelyn Ivins.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.812
You got something
that needs cleaning?

19:55.569 --> 19:58.238
(both chuckle)

19:58.322 --> 19:59.615
My partners and I, we're,

19:59.698 --> 20:01.241
we're filming
follow-up interviews

20:01.325 --> 20:02.618
for a documentary

20:02.701 --> 20:04.328
to, uh, investigate

20:04.411 --> 20:06.413
what we've learned
over the years.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.457
-Sure.
-Do you mind putting it in?

20:08.540 --> 20:09.333
The, the wire.

20:11.084 --> 20:11.251
That's it.

20:16.965 --> 20:17.841
(beeps)

20:19.968 --> 20:20.218
Fire away.

20:22.846 --> 20:23.347
Thanks so much
for coming here.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.228
I'd like to know more
about your past employer.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.522
Honey, I've had
several past employers.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.524
Yeah, the Durham
District Attorney.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.071
Thank you.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.699
Oh, I'm not one
to kiss and tell.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.493
Even though you're the one
working at a dry cleaner

20:44.576 --> 20:45.202
and Jim Harden's a judge?

20:49.706 --> 20:51.166
Art Holland:
I'm sure the case
was complicated,

20:51.250 --> 20:54.169
but, you know,
at the end of the day,

20:54.252 --> 20:56.171
everything pointed
to murder.

20:56.254 --> 20:58.048
Kathleen Peterson
was killed

20:58.131 --> 21:01.176
at the bottom
of that staircase.

21:01.259 --> 21:04.805
Did you ever consider
the alternatives?

21:04.888 --> 21:06.473
Honestly, not much.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.685
I don't ignore facts.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.646
You had debt, work stress,

21:12.729 --> 21:13.897
empty nest, infidelity,

21:13.981 --> 21:15.983
and the discovery of a lie.

21:16.066 --> 21:19.194
I wish murder
wasn't predictable,

21:19.278 --> 21:21.113
but it is.

21:21.196 --> 21:25.701
So... what if
it was murder?

21:27.077 --> 21:27.995
Okay.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.789
Go on.

21:32.332 --> 21:32.874
Michael sleeps with a man.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.210
-Dennis.
-(Art chuckles)

21:35.293 --> 21:36.795
So you heard
about Dennis Rowe?

21:40.298 --> 21:42.634
What-what-what's this
interview really about?

21:42.718 --> 21:44.553
I'd like to know more
about the relationship

21:44.636 --> 21:46.179
between the Durham DA

21:46.263 --> 21:49.391
and the State Bureau
of Investigation.

21:49.474 --> 21:53.186
-SBI.
-Well, the SBI is
an independent agency,

21:53.270 --> 21:56.064
uh, arriving at
objective conclusions

21:56.148 --> 21:57.482
based on the evidence
in hand.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.570
There is no relationship.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.113
Well, what I found suggests

22:03.196 --> 22:05.240
that isn't really
what's going on.

22:05.323 --> 22:06.575
The DA's office,

22:06.658 --> 22:09.202
they write the year-end
performance reviews

22:09.286 --> 22:11.580
for all SBI analysts.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.206
What are you suggesting?

22:13.290 --> 22:15.250
That it's pretty hard
to stay objective

22:15.333 --> 22:15.792
when your raise
is being determined

22:15.876 --> 22:18.211
by the prosecution.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.588
No.

22:19.671 --> 22:20.380
Honey, the Durham DA

22:20.464 --> 22:23.383
and the SBI
aren't hiding anything.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.135
It's no secret.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.512
I mean,
it may be problematic,

22:27.596 --> 22:28.972
but it's not illegal.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.477
Until the problematic
relationship encourages SBI

22:33.560 --> 22:37.522
to shade evidence or hide it
to suit the DA's needs.

22:38.315 --> 22:41.485
Okay. Alright,
well, uh, go on.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.279
Dennis tells someone
he knows about a rich man

22:44.362 --> 22:45.322
with a big house

22:45.405 --> 22:48.158
and... accidentally

22:48.241 --> 22:50.786
puts an idea
into a bad man's head.

22:50.869 --> 22:54.289
And that bad man goes
to 1810 Cedar,

22:54.372 --> 22:55.332
ends up killing Kathleen.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.751
Kathleen and Dennis
had the same injuries.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.545
So the same man
could have killed them both.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.005
Art:
So what you're saying is

23:02.089 --> 23:04.466
Rowe tells Tyrone Lacour
about Peterson.

23:04.549 --> 23:05.801
Tyrone Lacour?

23:05.884 --> 23:07.219
Uh, I'm sorry, who's this?

23:07.302 --> 23:08.428
Well, he, he killed Rowe.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.389
Career criminal...

23:11.473 --> 23:12.891
(garbled voice over earphone)

23:12.974 --> 23:14.976
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your mic. I can't...

23:15.060 --> 23:16.853
-Wait.
-What?

23:16.937 --> 23:20.315
You know, I started
as a defense attorney.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.528
My family, they had
run-ins with the law,

23:24.611 --> 23:27.697
and I thought
when I get the chance,

23:29.074 --> 23:30.992
why not help those in need?

23:32.369 --> 23:34.371
But then I met the needy.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.044
Men,

23:42.087 --> 23:43.171
mostly men,

23:44.047 --> 23:48.552
doing... horrible things
to women.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.137
And as a defense attorney,

23:50.220 --> 23:52.848
I had to do my best
to get 'em off.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.016
But you know what?
When it came to
the wife beaters,

23:55.100 --> 23:58.019
I didn't even really have
to try all that hard.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.771
You know, hit a woman
and give her a little...

24:00.981 --> 24:01.439
If you're unlucky, you get

24:03.150 --> 24:05.068
three months max
in county.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.738
But steal a man's car?

24:08.822 --> 24:10.323
No, now we're talking
real crime.

24:10.407 --> 24:13.577
Art:
Say Lacour's,
he's late on rent.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.870
Sorry.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.538
So he goes to Peterson's

24:16.621 --> 24:18.623
to steal some stuff
that he could sell.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.625
He surprises Kathleen.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.420
One thing leads
to another, and, uh,

24:23.503 --> 24:25.046
you've got yourself
a crime scene

24:25.130 --> 24:25.589
worth making a movie about.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.426
-Exactly.
-Yeah, but we,

24:29.509 --> 24:32.429
we didn't find
any signs of an intruder.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.389
Maybe you missed the signs.

24:34.472 --> 24:36.808
No, we didn't,
we didn't miss any
'cause there weren't any.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.104
Because, because Lacour,

24:41.730 --> 24:43.190
he knew Peterson...

24:44.149 --> 24:49.029
in the same way
Dennis knew Peterson.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.407
Michael knew Lacour?

24:52.490 --> 24:54.784
Oh yeah. When we
questioned Rowe, he folded.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.245
Told us that Peterson
was getting

24:57.329 --> 24:59.414
a piece of Lacour too.

24:59.497 --> 25:00.999
Lacour didn't need
to break in

25:01.082 --> 25:02.584
because he'd been
there before.

25:02.667 --> 25:03.418
With Michael.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.589
Michael slept
with both of them?

25:07.672 --> 25:09.841
Uh, Michael Peterson
fucked a lot of people.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.843
(chuckles)

25:13.303 --> 25:16.598
But this Lacour thing,
it's good, Sophie.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.099
It's real good.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.601
I'm going
to follow up on this.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.978
Freda:
I got worn out
helping the wrong people,

25:22.062 --> 25:23.855
so I decided
to switch teams.

25:25.732 --> 25:28.818
I could make a difference
in the DA's office.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.113
And it felt good, mostly.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.451
Sometimes it didn't.

25:38.411 --> 25:39.955
Because you
weren't playing fair.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.915
Life's not fair.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.626
And the law reflects that.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.628
If I think someone's done
something wrong,

25:46.711 --> 25:47.504
how am I going
to live with myself

25:47.587 --> 25:50.131
if I don't do
everything in my power

25:50.215 --> 25:51.675
to stop 'em
from doing it again, huh?

25:51.758 --> 25:54.469
Freda, there are three men
from around the state

25:54.552 --> 25:58.515
who have been executed
on faulty SBI evidence.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.684
They were killed for crimes
they didn't commit.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.229
That true?

26:04.312 --> 26:06.690
Evelyn Ivins:
I'm working
on a specific case.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.566
There's a man
sitting in prison

26:08.650 --> 26:10.068
who shouldn't be there.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.322
I got an order of napkins
I need to press.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.284
Will you testify to
the quid pro quo nature

26:17.367 --> 26:19.286
of the SBI/DA relationship?

26:20.870 --> 26:21.579
You know where
to find me, sweetie.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.385
I can't really
remember her.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.929
Your mom was an angel.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.724
She treasured you girls.

26:42.475 --> 26:45.145
What was she like
after my dad died?

26:45.228 --> 26:46.271
Oh, Liz was a mess.

26:46.354 --> 26:47.647
She couldn't understand

26:47.731 --> 26:50.025
why something like this
would happen to her.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.193
To you girls.

26:52.277 --> 26:55.030
After she died,
your emotions were so big.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.781
You had tantrums.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.868
That's what made
Michael so mad.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.454
He couldn't control you.
He didn't like that.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.332
So he did bad things.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.629
Did you see him hit me?

27:12.589 --> 27:14.007
No.

27:14.090 --> 27:17.052
I only saw what happened
after he hit you.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.888
Bruises on your arms,
your face.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.973
It was unbearable.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.267
You were too young
to remember, but Margaret.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.727
she could tell you.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.438
-She knows.
-No. That's not right.

27:28.521 --> 27:29.939
Aunt Blair could tell you

27:30.023 --> 27:31.900
how horrible Michael was
bouncing you

27:31.983 --> 27:33.234
from home to home.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.363
Michael and Patty kept
giving you away to people.

27:36.446 --> 27:37.906
Giving us away?

27:37.989 --> 27:39.532
There was a German couple
who wanted

27:39.616 --> 27:41.117
to adopt you and Margaret.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.535
It didn't work out
with them,

27:42.619 --> 27:44.120
so you went to Texas.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.830
Then Memphis.
Then Aunt Blair.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.332
Wait, what are you
talking about?

27:47.415 --> 27:49.334
Then Michael wanted
to keep Margaret

27:49.417 --> 27:51.252
and give you away.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.670
Your mama and papa
were already gone.

27:52.754 --> 27:56.466
Could you imagine
taking your sister from you?

27:59.511 --> 28:01.429
What was so wrong with me?

28:01.513 --> 28:02.931
Patty Peterson:
Oh, Martha.

28:03.014 --> 28:03.723
You were simply acting

28:03.807 --> 28:06.643
like a child
who had lost her father

28:06.726 --> 28:08.436
and then her dear mother.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.022
Lightning struck twice, and it
just made you a nightmare.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.274
That's all.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.819
-I was three.
-You had fits and tantrums.

28:15.902 --> 28:19.239
You hurt yourself.
You were bruised all the time.

28:19.322 --> 28:23.076
We, we could not assuage
your inner turmoil.

28:23.159 --> 28:24.577
Michael and I loved you,

28:24.661 --> 28:28.706
but it seemed
we could not love you enough.

28:28.790 --> 28:29.707
So you tried
to give me away?

28:32.001 --> 28:33.128
Jesus, Patty.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.095
I live my life
trying my best

28:43.054 --> 28:44.764
and also believing

28:44.848 --> 28:48.476
that everyone else
is trying their best.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.728
And that is all
people can do.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.650
That's all we
can expect from them.

28:55.733 --> 28:58.736
I extend this philosophy
to all my children.

28:59.821 --> 29:00.864
And even to Michael.

29:03.950 --> 29:08.663
When I feel disappointed,
I know it's simply my belief

29:08.746 --> 29:10.665
in a reality
that never truly existed.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.840
Are you disappointed,
Martha?

29:21.259 --> 29:23.761
I just wonder

29:25.638 --> 29:28.308
if all of this
hadn't happened...

29:30.935 --> 29:32.061
who would I be?

29:33.605 --> 29:37.192
If things
had been different,

29:37.275 --> 29:38.693
you would be different.

29:45.283 --> 29:46.576
For what it's worth...

29:48.453 --> 29:51.414
I really love who you are.

29:53.041 --> 29:57.170
And I look forward to knowing
the Martha you will become.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.812
You look beautiful.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.317
Beautiful women
deserve good news.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.903
-Hmm. We do?
-Mm-hmm.

30:21.986 --> 30:22.987
Simon called.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.407
-Simon?
-My agent.

30:26.491 --> 30:27.825
Right.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.370
Remember "Charlie Two Shoes"?

30:30.453 --> 30:31.746
Oh yeah,
I loved that book.

30:31.829 --> 30:35.208
Well, that book just got
optioned by some producer

30:35.291 --> 30:37.001
who wants to turn it
into a movie.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.211
-Big one.
-Really?

30:38.294 --> 30:41.381
-Yeah.
-Michael.

30:41.464 --> 30:43.216
You're not just telling me
something I want to hear

30:43.299 --> 30:44.592
to make me feel better,
are you?

30:44.676 --> 30:45.552
Check my phone.

30:45.635 --> 30:49.055
Simon called.
The option's guaranteed.

30:49.138 --> 30:51.266
What happens then,
I have no idea,

30:51.349 --> 30:52.183
but it seems promising.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.560
Wow.

30:55.061 --> 30:57.272
-How much?
-$10,000.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.567
Okay.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.695
Well, tomorrow
we'll celebrate,

31:03.778 --> 31:05.238
have a fun dinner.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.739
I'll go and buy
that watch for Caitlin

31:06.823 --> 31:07.699
that she really wants.

31:07.782 --> 31:09.742
She's got such good taste,

31:09.826 --> 31:10.827
just like her mother.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.413
Oh shit.

31:13.496 --> 31:13.997
We gotta light
the candles and leave.

31:15.623 --> 31:21.254
(classical music playing)

31:25.800 --> 31:26.926
(people chattering)

31:38.896 --> 31:41.441
-Something happening at Nortel
you're not telling me about?
-I know!

31:41.524 --> 31:42.650
Devon:
Kathleen.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.486
Excuse me.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.863
Hey, Devon.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.698
Isn't this pretty crazy?

31:51.576 --> 31:52.910
-Maybe a little much.
-Yeah.

31:52.994 --> 31:55.997
(upbeat jazz music playing)

32:02.629 --> 32:04.005
(indiscernible chatter)

32:04.088 --> 32:06.215
(laughter)

32:19.312 --> 32:21.648
Oh my god,
oh my god, oh my god.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.358
Remember CommTech?
The company Nortel bought?

32:23.441 --> 32:25.526
Yeah, of course.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.945
Well, they just sold it.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.906
-Who?
-They, as in, we.

32:29.989 --> 32:32.367
Nortel sold it
for, like, nothing.

32:32.950 --> 32:34.535
Who told you that?

32:34.619 --> 32:36.537
Amber, Ethan's assistant.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.539
She saw something
on his desk.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.124
What does this mean?

32:40.208 --> 32:42.543
Why would we sell
a company we just bought

32:42.627 --> 32:44.545
for less than
we bought it?

32:44.629 --> 32:45.713
I don't know,
whatever it means,

32:45.797 --> 32:47.090
we can't do anything
about it tonight.

32:47.173 --> 32:48.091
So just...

32:49.634 --> 32:52.261
(indistinct whispering)

32:58.142 --> 32:59.102
Okay.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.898
Devon: I'm sorry
to ruin your night.

33:03.981 --> 33:06.359
Why don't you go
flirt with someone

33:06.442 --> 33:07.735
you shouldn't be
flirting with.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.195
Okay.

33:10.988 --> 33:11.072
Oh.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.119
Your cocktail.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.414
You see that line?

33:19.497 --> 33:21.624
I had to butter up the bartender
just to cut in front.

33:21.708 --> 33:22.125
He's cute.

33:23.835 --> 33:24.043
I could get his number.

33:26.212 --> 33:26.963
For whom?

33:40.518 --> 33:41.769
Hey, Sophie.

33:46.774 --> 33:49.318
You have bad news?

33:49.402 --> 33:52.238
The Lacour theory
was good, Sophie.

33:52.321 --> 33:53.656
It was really good.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.784
How do you know
it wasn't him?

33:56.868 --> 33:57.994
Tyrone's got
the perfect alibi.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.456
Check again.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.083
The night Kathleen died,
he was in jail.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.627
That man wasn't
at 1810 Cedar.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.796
At least not
in December 2001.

34:12.383 --> 34:13.050
You came around.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.177
You know
Kathleen didn't fall.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.970
No.

34:17.263 --> 34:19.807
We don't know that.
Not for sure.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.642
In my experience, a woman
either has an accident

34:21.726 --> 34:21.976
or she doesn't.

34:24.270 --> 34:26.981
But, hey, that's just,
that's just my experience.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.692
Well, in my experience,
I've always found life

34:29.776 --> 34:32.236
to be far more complicated

34:32.320 --> 34:33.070
than yes or no,
black or white.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.201
An owl, or something
you've never thought about.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.581
Sophie, sometimes
life isn't complicated.

34:45.124 --> 34:47.668
The answers, they're sitting
right there in front of you

34:47.752 --> 34:48.044
just waiting for you
to see 'em.

34:51.923 --> 34:53.382
I don't need you
here anymore.

34:54.383 --> 34:55.301
(Art clears throat)

34:56.219 --> 34:57.220
Take care, Sophie.

35:21.577 --> 35:23.454
(buzzer sounds)

35:29.794 --> 35:31.587
I didn't know
you were back.

35:31.671 --> 35:33.548
(Sophie chuckles)

35:42.974 --> 35:45.393
Is everything okay?
Are the kids--

35:45.476 --> 35:46.644
I never left Durham.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.230
Hmm.

35:51.983 --> 35:52.900
Well...

35:56.654 --> 35:58.114
you didn't have
to lie to me.

35:58.197 --> 35:59.073
-Why did you?
-Dennis Rowe.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.327
You slept with him.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.371
Dennis was killed.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.333
Okay.

36:10.751 --> 36:13.546
Blunt force trauma to the head
with no skull fractures.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.382
No.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.136
That's unbelievable.

36:20.219 --> 36:23.389
Oddly, that's not the part
that's hard to believe.

36:23.472 --> 36:28.728
The man who killed him
was another man you... knew.

36:29.729 --> 36:30.146
Tyrone Lacour.

36:34.942 --> 36:36.152
You slept with him, too.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.781
Michael...

36:40.865 --> 36:43.576
you know, I thought maybe
I finally got the answer

36:43.659 --> 36:45.953
that if this guy
had killed Kathleen,

36:46.037 --> 36:48.831
that it was all
a horrible mistake.

36:48.915 --> 36:52.501
But all I did
was open Pandora's box.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.714
This is crazy.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.551
Michael!

37:00.635 --> 37:02.720
Don't you have
anything to say?

37:05.890 --> 37:08.809
I-I-I lied about Dennis.

37:10.144 --> 37:11.437
I don't know Tyrone.

37:12.563 --> 37:13.814
At least,
I don't think I do.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.442
I mean, sure,
it's possible.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.029
Sophie, I don't want
to be the reason

37:20.112 --> 37:22.531
you can't get
the life you want.

37:24.283 --> 37:25.826
If you need
something more,

37:25.910 --> 37:28.496
if you need something
different than this,

37:28.579 --> 37:30.122
than me,

37:30.206 --> 37:31.207
I understand.

37:32.875 --> 37:33.209
But you're what I want.

37:39.674 --> 37:40.800
I'm not her.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.514
(crying)
I'm not Kathleen.

37:46.597 --> 37:47.765
No, I know you're not.

37:47.848 --> 37:49.892
I want the truth,
just like she did.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.397
And...

37:56.315 --> 37:58.651
I won't share you,
not in that way.

37:58.734 --> 37:59.318
No, you don't.
And you won't.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.030
You know,
I'll give you everything.

38:10.746 --> 38:11.247
So what do you want
to do here?

38:15.751 --> 38:16.293
I need more time.

38:26.012 --> 38:29.098
(siren wailing in distance)

38:34.437 --> 38:36.147
-(door opens)
-Sophie: Jean.

38:36.689 --> 38:37.732
Sophie.

38:39.025 --> 38:41.235
Sophie, Sophie, Sophie...

38:49.285 --> 38:51.412
(speaking in French)

39:09.055 --> 39:10.765
(Jean speaking French)

39:33.537 --> 39:34.789
Um...

40:34.807 --> 40:35.933
-(mimics explosion)
-(Jean chuckles)

40:36.684 --> 40:37.518
Shit.

40:53.659 --> 40:55.369
(door opens)

40:55.452 --> 40:56.412
David: (on screen)
Is there anyone in the room

40:56.495 --> 40:57.997
who thinks
she didn't know?

40:59.123 --> 41:01.834
Mike said Kathleen knew.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.794
So she must
have known, right?

41:07.256 --> 41:07.381
Right?

41:14.889 --> 41:17.600
Has anyone in this room
ever successfully hidden

41:17.683 --> 41:19.351
anything from their wives?

41:19.435 --> 41:20.394
(all chuckle)

41:22.062 --> 41:24.023
Moving on.

41:25.858 --> 41:27.610
Evelyn:
With Freda's help,
we can prove

41:27.693 --> 41:29.820
that they didn't have
the results to convict him,

41:29.904 --> 41:32.114
and they buried
exculpatory evidence.

41:32.198 --> 41:33.073
Man: (on phone)
Before we go public,
you're 100 percent sure

41:33.157 --> 41:35.034
this guy didn't do it.

41:35.117 --> 41:35.910
Evelyn:
He's innocent.

41:35.993 --> 41:38.495
But there's more.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.416
It seems to be
a systemic issue.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.920
I can't tell you how widespread
the corruption goes,

41:46.003 --> 41:47.671
but I can say for sure

41:47.755 --> 41:49.590
this isn't just
a one-off thing.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.218
He's not the only victim here.

41:52.301 --> 41:53.761
Man: Alright.
Do we have motive?

41:53.844 --> 41:55.596
Motive?

41:57.014 --> 41:57.514
I think I got that too.

42:01.268 --> 42:02.519
(metallic clinking)

42:02.603 --> 42:04.939
I'm not sure
there's anything to find.

42:09.026 --> 42:12.071
Keep looking.

42:12.154 --> 42:14.365
Case 432. What's shaking
with that lawnmower?

42:14.448 --> 42:16.784
-(banging)
-(men shouting)

42:16.867 --> 42:19.662
(indistinct shouting)

42:22.915 --> 42:24.458
-Sir, what's going on?
-Officer: On your knees, sir.

42:24.541 --> 42:25.751
On your knees.
On your knees.

42:25.834 --> 42:26.710
-On your knees.
-What's going on?

42:26.794 --> 42:27.836
Keep your eyes
to the front.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.921
Newsreader:
Evidence now shows that

42:29.004 --> 42:31.340
the North Carolina State
Bureau of Investigation

42:31.423 --> 42:33.676
has failed
to perform their duty.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.803
Findings by the
Innocence Project revealed

42:35.886 --> 42:38.430
that SBI frequently
withheld test results

42:38.514 --> 42:39.682
that contradicted
the DA's case.

42:39.765 --> 42:43.894
And this is how Greg Taylor
spent 19 years in prison

42:43.978 --> 42:45.854
for a crime
he did not commit.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.815
Taylor was convicted
in 1993

42:47.898 --> 42:49.817
in the beating death
of Jacquetta Thomas.

42:49.900 --> 42:52.361
The only physical evidence
was a spot of blood

42:52.444 --> 42:54.655
found near the wheel
of his SUV.

42:54.738 --> 42:57.574
But further testing by SBI
revealed the substance

42:57.658 --> 43:00.327
was inconsistent
with human blood.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.246
This second test was
never shared with the court

43:02.329 --> 43:04.832
or with Taylor's defense.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.667
Evelyn Ivins,
an attorney

43:06.750 --> 43:08.919
for the North Carolina
Innocence Project,

43:09.003 --> 43:11.297
led the investigation
into SBI.

43:11.380 --> 43:13.924
Our findings in
the Greg Taylor case suggest

43:14.008 --> 43:17.553
SBI labs intentionally
hid exculpatory evidence

43:17.636 --> 43:19.054
that would have
exonerated him.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.307
Further investigation
leads us to believe

43:21.390 --> 43:22.725
that the corruption
between state DA

43:22.808 --> 43:27.062
and the supposedly independent
investigative unit,

43:27.146 --> 43:30.024
it's a complex web of lies,

43:30.107 --> 43:30.983
which is why we are thrilled

43:31.066 --> 43:34.570
to announce audits
of all SBI cases to date

43:34.653 --> 43:37.364
to ensure other
wrongly convicted men

43:37.448 --> 43:39.908
and women
get their day in court.

43:39.992 --> 43:41.994
What the fuck?

43:45.122 --> 43:46.665
-Woman: Sir.
-Bill Peterson:
No, I'm going in.

43:46.749 --> 43:47.583
-Woman: You can't go in there.
-Bill: Yes. Call security.

43:47.666 --> 43:49.668
-Woman: Sir!
-Bill: We're very good friends.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.545
Trust me. He's going
to be very happy to see me.

43:55.174 --> 43:56.216
(door slams)

43:56.300 --> 43:57.885
My money was on tomorrow,

43:57.968 --> 43:59.094
but tonight works.

43:59.178 --> 44:01.055
David, this SBI thing

44:01.138 --> 44:03.265
is just absolute insanity.

44:03.349 --> 44:06.060
Those, those motherfuckers!

44:06.143 --> 44:06.894
Okay, settle down, Bill.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.687
We always knew
they were full of shit.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.356
Now we have proof. You,

44:10.439 --> 44:11.982
you should have known
how corrupt they were.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.817
-Jesus Christ!
-Of course, I knew.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.402
They were all corrupt.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.072
Which was why
we ran our own tests.

44:18.155 --> 44:19.823
It's why I cost so much.

44:19.907 --> 44:21.533
But when the state
audits our case,

44:21.617 --> 44:23.619
they aren't going to find
any SBI wrongdoing.

44:23.702 --> 44:26.038
We kept our eyes on things.

44:26.121 --> 44:27.456
You think Tom Maher's
going to let

44:27.539 --> 44:29.041
some bullshit like this fly?

44:32.044 --> 44:33.128
We can't give up.

44:33.212 --> 44:36.340
Hey, nobody said anything
about giving up.

44:36.423 --> 44:37.466
You did.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.593
Three years ago.

44:40.719 --> 44:43.389
You left my brother
to rot in there.

44:44.932 --> 44:47.559
David:
Come on, sit.
Please, sit.

44:47.643 --> 44:49.061
Bill, hey.

44:49.144 --> 44:50.896
Come on.
Please, sit.

44:52.481 --> 44:52.689
Sit.

45:07.913 --> 45:09.873
I don't keep this
because I'm in it.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.544
I keep it 'cause I'm not.

45:15.587 --> 45:19.007
It reminds me of Michael.
The mistakes I made.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.051
The ones you only see
in hindsight.

45:26.348 --> 45:27.724
I don't like to lose.

45:29.476 --> 45:32.312
And I really don't like seeing
my clients in prison,

45:32.396 --> 45:34.481
especially when
they're innocent.

45:34.565 --> 45:37.526
But we already did
some digging.

45:37.609 --> 45:39.570
SBI didn't fuck us.

45:42.239 --> 45:43.657
Yes, David, but?

45:43.740 --> 45:45.701
An SBI agent did.

45:45.784 --> 45:49.872
A Mr. Duane Deaver lied
about his experience.

45:49.955 --> 45:52.207
He lied on the stand,
under oath.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.918
He said he was an expert.

45:55.002 --> 45:56.587
That he had overseen, what,

45:56.670 --> 45:59.173
500 blood spatter cases.

45:59.256 --> 46:00.632
At the time
Deaver testified,

46:00.716 --> 46:03.469
he'd only been
to fifty-fucking-four.

46:05.262 --> 46:06.847
-Deaver perjured himself?
-Yeah.

46:06.930 --> 46:08.182
W-what does that get us?

46:08.265 --> 46:10.809
Well, we've been
here before

46:10.893 --> 46:12.811
with the computers.

46:12.895 --> 46:15.856
We need to prove
that Deaver's testimony swayed

46:15.939 --> 46:16.607
the jury enough

46:16.690 --> 46:19.359
that had it
not been included,

46:19.443 --> 46:21.612
the verdict could have
gone another way.

46:21.695 --> 46:24.114
-And then?
-And then maybe,

46:24.198 --> 46:28.494
maybe by the grace
of a reasonable God,

46:28.577 --> 46:30.329
we get a hearing for a retrial.

46:30.412 --> 46:34.917
Not a retrial, but...
a hearing for one.

46:36.168 --> 46:38.504
If that goes the way
we want it to,

46:39.296 --> 46:40.339
he will be out.

46:40.422 --> 46:40.923
-That's good.
-Yeah.

46:44.468 --> 46:46.136
-That's good.
-It's really good.

46:49.223 --> 46:51.517
I don't care what it takes
or how long.

46:53.602 --> 46:55.103
You're going to make up
for these mistakes.

46:56.813 --> 46:58.774
You're going to figure out
how this helps my brother.

46:59.691 --> 47:01.944
And you're going
to do it for free.

47:08.659 --> 47:09.618
He's not listening
to reason.

47:09.701 --> 47:12.162
You, uh, you may want
to rethink

47:12.246 --> 47:13.914
your tickets
for tomorrow.

47:13.997 --> 47:14.456
He's not taking
the plea?

47:14.540 --> 47:16.750
I'll speak with him.

47:16.833 --> 47:18.919
Okay.
Be my guest.

47:19.002 --> 47:21.255
Tell him he's being
a fool. Okay?

47:21.338 --> 47:23.423
A moron. This has been
years in the making.

47:23.507 --> 47:26.343
He is lucky
to be here today.

47:26.426 --> 47:28.303
He could go back
to prison.

47:28.387 --> 47:30.430
That is a very real reality.

47:30.514 --> 47:33.392
Just let me talk
to him, David.

47:42.651 --> 47:44.611
I know this wasn't
our plan. I'm sorry.

47:44.695 --> 47:47.281
Sophie:
We've talked about this.

47:48.198 --> 47:50.450
You'd have to lie
about that night.

47:53.620 --> 47:55.163
To get what you want.

47:56.415 --> 47:57.708
What we want.

47:58.542 --> 47:59.960
But I can't lie anymore.

48:00.043 --> 48:02.254
I'm not perfect.
Jesus, no man is.

48:02.337 --> 48:04.423
But I'm not this.
Mm-mm.

48:08.343 --> 48:09.803
And the kids,

48:09.886 --> 48:11.221
the money.

48:13.515 --> 48:15.767
But if I don't sign,
it all starts again.

48:15.851 --> 48:17.311
-Sophie: Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

48:17.394 --> 48:18.854
And if you take this plea,

48:18.937 --> 48:21.023
you can leave Durham
tomorrow.

48:22.190 --> 48:24.693
And finally... be done.

48:25.694 --> 48:27.529
Whatever you decide.
I'll be here.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.199
But I must say one thing.

48:31.283 --> 48:35.996
The DA doesn't care about
what really happened.

48:36.079 --> 48:37.539
People who believe
you're guilty,

48:37.623 --> 48:38.582
they do not care
about other truths.

48:38.665 --> 48:41.960
The table's crooked, Michael.

48:42.044 --> 48:44.171
No matter the circumstance,
they'll never say
they were wrong.

48:44.254 --> 48:45.505
Why the fuck not?

48:45.589 --> 48:46.798
Why can't they just see
that's what happened?

48:46.882 --> 48:47.883
They made a mistake.

48:47.966 --> 48:49.009
We get to go back
and correct it.

48:49.092 --> 48:51.928
We get to fix the past,
and that's never an option.

48:52.721 --> 48:53.847
But today...

48:55.140 --> 48:56.266
today it is.

48:57.100 --> 48:59.061
I need to speak
with Jean alone.

49:04.483 --> 49:07.653
(telephone rings)

49:08.945 --> 49:10.280
Kathleen Peterson's office.

49:11.281 --> 49:12.866
Sure.

49:14.951 --> 49:15.077
(sighs)

49:31.343 --> 49:33.553
Kathleen.

49:34.846 --> 49:35.972
Kathleen.

49:36.890 --> 49:38.558
They want to see you.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.946
Remember you have Mike's
celebration dinner tonight.

49:55.033 --> 49:56.076
Man 1:
This one was done.

49:56.159 --> 49:56.743
Man 2: Yeah,
it's gonna be a long day.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.620
Man 1:
Yeah, it's brutal,

49:58.704 --> 50:00.163
but what can we do?

50:02.541 --> 50:04.626
Thank you for joining us
on such short notice.

50:04.710 --> 50:07.003
-Of course.
-Man 2: Sit.

50:17.931 --> 50:20.600
I wish we could say
we called you here

50:20.684 --> 50:23.645
with better news,
but, um...

50:25.647 --> 50:28.650
it seems
we won't be giving

50:28.734 --> 50:30.736
end-of-year bonuses.

50:39.202 --> 50:40.412
Oh.

50:45.292 --> 50:47.252
Okay. That-that...
Yes, that is...

50:48.378 --> 50:49.629
(sighs)

50:50.213 --> 50:52.549
that is bad news.

50:52.632 --> 50:55.177
Man 1:
None of us will be
receiving bonuses.

50:55.260 --> 50:56.887
The third and
fourth quarters were, uh...

50:58.472 --> 50:59.973
challenging.

51:02.309 --> 51:05.020
So, no year...
No, no year-end bonuses.

51:06.563 --> 51:07.856
Man 2:
Correct.

51:10.233 --> 51:11.359
(laughs)

51:16.031 --> 51:17.115
(laughing)

51:19.451 --> 51:21.453
See, I was just sitting
at my desk,

51:21.536 --> 51:24.498
and I watched
our stock drop

51:24.581 --> 51:27.042
27 percent
in under four minutes.

51:28.543 --> 51:32.923
Um... I mean, it has
not stopped going down.

51:33.006 --> 51:35.091
So, I mean,
who cares about bonuses?

51:37.385 --> 51:38.053
(laughing)

51:41.765 --> 51:44.309
I just lost my retirement.

51:45.894 --> 51:47.020
All of it.

51:48.271 --> 51:50.357
Nearly a million dollars.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.192
Ohh!

51:52.275 --> 51:53.652
Oh my...

51:55.570 --> 51:57.864
(door opens, closes)

52:07.415 --> 52:08.542
Sorry I'm late.

52:08.625 --> 52:09.376
Did you come straight
from the gym?

52:09.459 --> 52:11.628
Indeed.

52:11.711 --> 52:12.128
Here.
(clears throat)

52:16.800 --> 52:19.344
-Have you been home?
-Busy day.

52:19.427 --> 52:21.346
Someone gave me
a list of Christmas chores.

52:24.724 --> 52:27.060
What should we order?

52:27.143 --> 52:28.895
Oh, I, uh,
I already did.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.272
I ordered,
I ordered a lot.

52:31.815 --> 52:32.858
Celebration.

52:34.818 --> 52:36.194
-(sighs)
-(glasses clink)

52:39.865 --> 52:42.409
But seriously,
this book option

52:42.492 --> 52:43.118
could lead
to some real money.

52:45.495 --> 52:48.540
And then you can rest,
not worry so much about Nortel.

52:48.623 --> 52:50.083
That's great.
I mean, it's really...

52:51.167 --> 52:53.003
That's great, Michael.
Um...

52:55.964 --> 52:56.214
I have to tell you
something.

52:59.259 --> 53:00.927
Shoot.

53:01.011 --> 53:03.388
I, I thought you would
have already known, but, um,

53:03.471 --> 53:04.723
our stocks...

53:05.098 --> 53:06.975
Nortel.

53:08.935 --> 53:10.145
It's all gone.
Everything's gone.

53:12.522 --> 53:13.565
What are you talking about?

53:13.648 --> 53:16.276
Retirement account.
Moving to Paris in ten years.

53:16.359 --> 53:20.322
I mean, all our dreams,
they're, they're...
they're dead.

53:23.366 --> 53:24.576
It's all gone.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.162
The bubble burst.

53:27.245 --> 53:28.872
You're shitting me.
We're poor?

53:28.955 --> 53:32.959
All those hours
and work trips

53:33.043 --> 53:36.171
and... sacrifices.

53:36.254 --> 53:37.422
I mean, I have...

53:39.549 --> 53:41.009
wasted...

53:41.718 --> 53:44.512
wasted years of my life.

53:46.431 --> 53:48.475
And now I'm sitting here in this
fucking Chinese restaurant,

53:48.558 --> 53:52.020
and I don't even know if I
can afford this stupid meal.

53:52.103 --> 53:53.021
Michael:
Hey, no.

53:53.104 --> 53:54.189
The movie's going
to work out, huh?

53:56.900 --> 53:57.275
What?

53:59.402 --> 54:00.987
Do you think some
Hollywood producer's

54:01.071 --> 54:03.114
going to come along
and make you a millionaire?

54:03.198 --> 54:04.616
Are you kidding?

54:04.699 --> 54:06.368
You're fucking
kidding me, Michael?

54:07.535 --> 54:10.080
We'll figure it out.
It'll be okay.

54:11.456 --> 54:14.000
The only way
this will be okay

54:14.084 --> 54:15.877
is if I make it okay,

54:15.961 --> 54:18.171
and I am way
too fucking exhausted.

54:19.005 --> 54:20.507
You're not alone here.

54:20.590 --> 54:22.968
Well, sometimes I think
it would be easier if I was.

54:24.469 --> 54:26.596
Oh, I see.

54:27.722 --> 54:28.640
What? What do you see?

54:28.723 --> 54:31.059

-(scoffs)

54:31.142 --> 54:35.647
-What?
-You know, you used to be fun.

54:35.730 --> 54:37.565
Your eyes, they used
to have a light behind them.

54:37.649 --> 54:39.943
And now all I see is,
is this stress case.

54:40.026 --> 54:42.904
You forgot what it is
to smile, to be alive.

54:44.781 --> 54:47.033
Fuck you, Michael.

54:47.117 --> 54:48.868
You know, you, you used
to take care of yourself.

54:48.952 --> 54:50.495
You used to be
a really good time.

54:50.578 --> 54:54.416
(Kathleen laughs)
A good time?

54:54.499 --> 54:57.961
I am too busy
to be anyone's good time.

54:58.044 --> 54:59.546
I am busy working.

54:59.629 --> 55:02.007
I am busy
raising your children.

55:02.090 --> 55:03.967
I mean, Margaret and Martha,
they were a mess before me.

55:04.050 --> 55:07.220
And the boys.
Your boys.

55:07.303 --> 55:09.472
I am the one
who supports them.

55:09.556 --> 55:11.599
I am the one who visited
Clayton in prison.

55:11.683 --> 55:14.894
And Todd, god, he is so lost
looking for your approval,

55:14.978 --> 55:17.063
I don't think he'll
ever find his way home.

55:17.147 --> 55:19.399
And you just wander
through life, going to the gym

55:19.482 --> 55:22.402
and yelling at the dogs
and spending my money,

55:22.485 --> 55:25.572
promising these big,
beautiful dreams like Paris,

55:25.655 --> 55:28.450
and then you don't do a goddamn
thing to make them happen.

55:28.533 --> 55:29.242
I mean,
I thought I married a man.

55:29.325 --> 55:32.746
It turns out
all I got was a boy

55:32.829 --> 55:34.706
who is only good

55:34.789 --> 55:37.167
for getting drinks
at the bar.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.176
Say something.

55:47.677 --> 55:48.303
Michael.

55:50.013 --> 55:51.264
Are you even here?!

55:59.481 --> 56:00.523
Of course, I am.

56:00.607 --> 56:02.776
I'm here for you,

56:02.859 --> 56:04.986
for the kids,

56:05.070 --> 56:06.946
for my parents,

56:07.030 --> 56:08.865
for my men in combat.

56:09.532 --> 56:11.284
I've always been here.

56:11.367 --> 56:15.121
Maybe you're the one
who's disappeared.

56:15.205 --> 56:17.582
Maybe the problem is
that the life you have
isn't the life you want.

56:17.665 --> 56:20.251
And I am damned, Kathleen,
if I'm going to continue
to be your whipping boy.

56:20.335 --> 56:21.544
So figure it out!

56:22.045 --> 56:24.089
Or move on.

56:24.839 --> 56:26.132
