WEBVTT

00:04.069 --> 00:05.800
- so i booked a sketch artist,
an improv troupe,

00:05.801 --> 00:07.692
and there'll be a laser
projecting a burning pelvis

00:07.759 --> 00:08.726
onto the ceiling.

00:08.792 --> 00:10.192
- a laser!

00:10.258 --> 00:11.459
well, this isn't gonna be
your mother's

00:11.525 --> 00:12.925
sexually transmitted disease
awareness fair.

00:14.392 --> 00:15.225
you've been quite
the little helper, annie.

00:15.292 --> 00:16.925
- oh, std fair, guys.

00:16.991 --> 00:19.759
catch knowledge.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.459
- you think you're better
than me?

00:27.525 --> 00:28.925
- no.

00:28.991 --> 00:30.858
- you stick to quotin'
movie lines.

00:30.925 --> 00:32.325
i'll stick to sports.

00:32.392 --> 00:34.158
- i'm trying to reduce
my pop-cultural referencing.

00:34.225 --> 00:36.759
- well, you're not moving
into sports.

00:36.826 --> 00:39.891
you and i are playing
real basketball, right now.

00:39.958 --> 00:41.225
- sounds fun.

00:41.292 --> 00:44.525
- no, it doesn't!
and it won't be.

00:44.592 --> 00:46.891
- catch knowledge.
- sorry, not interested...

00:46.958 --> 00:49.692
in ignoring your
very important cause.

00:49.759 --> 00:51.225
hi, i'm jeff winger.

00:51.292 --> 00:53.726
- oh, sabrina is
my new secretary.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.392
- "secretary" is a little
degrading to women.

00:56.459 --> 00:58.125
i help the dean do
officey things.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.025
- oh, gender saved.

01:00.092 --> 01:02.359
- my casual friend and i
are gonna have

01:02.425 --> 01:04.825
a non-romantic breakfast
if you'd like to join us.

01:04.891 --> 01:05.925
- the cafeteria's closed
while we set up for the fair.

01:05.991 --> 01:07.092
fortune cookie?

01:07.158 --> 01:08.726
- isn't it great?

01:08.792 --> 01:10.459
greendale is the latest campus
to catch a case

01:10.525 --> 01:12.058
of public health fever!

01:12.125 --> 01:13.991
- you know the toilets
in the women's bathrooms

01:14.058 --> 01:15.125
don't have seats, right?

01:15.192 --> 01:18.092
- because they keep
getting stolen.

01:18.158 --> 01:19.492
sabrina, take a note.

01:19.559 --> 01:21.726
i want hidden cameras
in every stall.

01:21.792 --> 01:24.225
- problem solved.

01:24.292 --> 01:28.258
- "you will get aids."
- flip it over.

01:28.325 --> 01:30.025
- "unless you go
to the std fair."

01:30.092 --> 01:31.692
- i wrote that.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.325
- congratu--
horrible!

01:34.392 --> 01:38.991
- see you later.

01:45.158 --> 01:47.991
- jeff...you and i
are friends, right?

01:48.058 --> 01:49.692
- okay.

01:49.759 --> 01:52.891
- you may have noticed
a recent change in my demeanor.

01:52.958 --> 01:54.158
- i haven't.

01:54.225 --> 01:55.891
- well, i have
a new girlfriend.

01:55.958 --> 01:59.925
and she is super smart,
if you know what i mean.

01:59.991 --> 02:01.891
- unfortunately,
i always know what you mean.

02:01.958 --> 02:03.092
- can't wait for you
to meet her.

02:03.158 --> 02:05.125
you know,
when you catch a big fish,

02:05.192 --> 02:08.559
you want to stuff her
and put her on the mantle.

02:08.625 --> 02:11.025
how 'bout tonight?
- i doubt it.

02:11.092 --> 02:12.759
- troy and i played basketball.
it was fun.

02:12.826 --> 02:14.158
- don't gloat.

02:14.225 --> 02:15.692
it's impossible
to guard you.

02:15.759 --> 02:18.925
your eyes are too gentle
and mysterious.

02:18.991 --> 02:20.759
- hey, guys, jeff and i are
double-dating tonight

02:20.826 --> 02:22.559
with my new girlfriend.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.058
ooh...

02:24.125 --> 02:26.125
- you got that from
"i doubt it"?

02:26.192 --> 02:27.925
- pierce has got
a girlfriend!

02:27.991 --> 02:30.058
- that's great.
what does she do?

02:30.125 --> 02:32.991
- she's an escort.
- oh...

02:33.058 --> 02:34.925
- some mysteries
solve themselves, don't they?

02:34.991 --> 02:36.625
- no, no, no,
that's just her profession.

02:36.692 --> 02:38.826
she doesn't escort me.
no, no.

02:38.891 --> 02:40.792
i met her in my marketing class.

02:40.858 --> 02:43.891
and i'm taking doreen
to annie's mixer tonight.

02:43.958 --> 02:46.392
- you mean the std fair.
catch knowledge.

02:46.459 --> 02:48.726
- taking a call girl
to an std fair.

02:48.792 --> 02:50.292
there's a joke here.

02:50.359 --> 02:51.958
- so, jeff, dust off
that black book

02:52.025 --> 02:53.392
and rustle up a honey, huh?

02:53.459 --> 02:57.025
- is there a pill that
makes the word "no" clearer?

02:57.092 --> 02:58.592
- well, i guess it is
pretty short notice.

02:58.659 --> 02:59.826
probably couldn't
get a date anyway.

02:59.891 --> 03:03.392
- oooohh...
- i'm sure you're right.

03:03.459 --> 03:05.826
oooohh...

03:05.891 --> 03:07.258
- maybe it has something
to do with crabs.

03:07.325 --> 03:09.392
they're like a food,
but they're also a disease.

03:09.459 --> 03:11.292
- you know, i wonder, jeffrey,
for all your feather flashing,

03:11.359 --> 03:13.325
when was the last time
you actually scored?

03:13.392 --> 03:14.891
- well, i don't know
the precise date, pierce,

03:14.958 --> 03:17.625
because i'm not you,
so there's no receipt.

03:17.692 --> 03:19.092
ooohh...

03:19.158 --> 03:20.058
- meh...

03:20.125 --> 03:21.559
- oh, come on.

03:21.625 --> 03:23.525
- jeff, you shouldn't
take potshots at some poor woman

03:23.592 --> 03:25.092
just because you can't
get a date.

03:25.158 --> 03:27.991
- i can get dates
anytime i want.

03:28.058 --> 03:29.025
what is this,
some kind of joke?

03:29.092 --> 03:31.692
- no. this is.

03:31.759 --> 03:35.759
"don't eat the crab dip."
yay-yay!

03:35.826 --> 03:38.125
- ah...you hear that, annie?

03:38.192 --> 03:40.225
that's the sound
of stds screaming,

03:40.292 --> 03:42.592
"no! stop being
so aware of us!"

03:42.659 --> 03:44.258
- aah!

03:44.325 --> 03:45.991
- and it's all thanks
to you.

03:46.058 --> 03:49.092
- i was voted most likely
to succeed at my rehab clinic.

03:49.158 --> 03:52.158
- well, in recognition
of all your hard work,

03:52.225 --> 03:54.792
i have decided that you
should conduct

03:54.858 --> 03:56.325
the condom demonstration.

03:56.392 --> 03:59.659
you're gonna be center stage
showing everyone

03:59.726 --> 04:02.058
how to put a condom
on a, well,

04:02.125 --> 04:03.925
what my dad called
a jimmy carter.

04:03.991 --> 04:07.792
- um, i don't know if i'm
the right person for that.

04:07.858 --> 04:09.192
- don't worry, not a real one.

04:09.258 --> 04:11.625
no, it's an anatomically
correct model, you know.

04:11.692 --> 04:15.092
but trust me, eyes closed,
you can't tell the difference.

04:15.158 --> 04:17.125
okay.

04:25.392 --> 04:27.726
- hey, it's jeff winger.

04:27.792 --> 04:32.192
well, i wanted to see
what you were doing tonight.

04:32.258 --> 04:33.858
what do you mean,
do i know your name?

04:33.925 --> 04:34.925
what kind of a question
is that?

04:34.991 --> 04:37.092
of course i know.

04:37.158 --> 04:39.058
well, if i answer now,

04:39.125 --> 04:42.158
you'll never learn
a valuable lesson about trust,

04:42.225 --> 04:44.125
jennifer.

04:44.192 --> 04:46.025
crap! ahh...

04:46.092 --> 04:49.492
- pierce really got
to you, huh?

04:49.559 --> 04:51.258
- it has been a dry spell.

04:51.325 --> 04:52.726
but that's only because it's
been a while since i've tried.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.292
so i'm trying.

04:54.359 --> 04:55.891
- yeah, i can see that.

04:55.958 --> 04:58.192
this is a lot
of outgoing calls.

04:58.258 --> 05:02.292
"car wash redhead.
tube top, r.e.m. concert.

05:02.359 --> 05:04.925
juror number six."
that sounds aboveboard.

05:04.991 --> 05:06.058
at least you have "mommy"
in here.

05:06.125 --> 05:07.525
- it's not my mom.

05:07.592 --> 05:09.826
- dude, not cool.

05:09.891 --> 05:12.325
- you saying "dude"
is not cool.

05:12.392 --> 05:13.925
what are you doing?

05:13.991 --> 05:15.925
- heh!

05:15.991 --> 05:18.058
"hot blonde, spanish class"?

05:18.125 --> 05:20.058
- you're welcome.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.625
- this is the phone book
of a man in his 20s.

05:21.692 --> 05:23.858
the women literally have
no identities.

05:23.925 --> 05:25.459
it's pretty shallow.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.726
- you're right.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.991
i can't believe i haven't
seen it before now.

05:30.058 --> 05:31.325
- whatever.

05:31.392 --> 05:33.192
i'm gonna go study
with shirley.

05:33.258 --> 05:35.826
- well, i'll be here...
rethinking my way of life.

05:35.891 --> 05:37.792
- mm.

05:40.759 --> 05:43.092
- call mommy.

05:43.158 --> 05:46.759
- guys...
i have a problem.

05:46.826 --> 05:48.459
the dean wants me
to demonstrate

05:48.525 --> 05:51.092
the proper use of a condom
at the stupid fair

05:51.158 --> 05:53.192
by putting one
on a mannequin's stupid...

05:53.258 --> 05:55.292
thingamabob.

05:55.359 --> 05:58.025
it's a big honor...

05:58.092 --> 05:59.425
but i'm gonna screw it up.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.392
- well, it's easy enough
to practice.

06:01.459 --> 06:02.891
britta, do you have
a banana?

06:02.958 --> 06:06.759
- this is an anatomically
correct model i'll be handling.

06:06.826 --> 06:10.425
real...whatchamacallits...
are nothing like bananas!

06:10.492 --> 06:11.792
are they?

06:11.858 --> 06:14.625
- have you never seen one?

06:14.692 --> 06:16.425
- shh!
- annie...

06:16.492 --> 06:18.158
being a virgin
in this day and age

06:18.225 --> 06:19.425
is something to be proud of.

06:19.492 --> 06:20.459
you're like a unicorn.

06:20.525 --> 06:23.925
- i am not a unicorn.

06:23.991 --> 06:26.858
i had relations
with my high school boyfriend.

06:26.925 --> 06:29.125
we did it to madonna's erotica

06:29.192 --> 06:30.592
on the floor
of his walk-in closet.

06:30.659 --> 06:33.125
but he wouldn't let me
look at it.

06:33.192 --> 06:36.692
and he cried after.
and during.

06:36.759 --> 06:38.525
he's gay now.

06:38.592 --> 06:40.025
i think he was gay then.

06:40.092 --> 06:42.659
- so you, uh, you never seen one
when you were growing up?

06:42.726 --> 06:44.592
like, you know, on the internet,
in a picture,

06:44.659 --> 06:45.858
or harvey keitel's?

06:45.925 --> 06:47.425
- i've caught glimpses,

06:47.492 --> 06:50.192
but i've never got
a real good look at one.

06:50.258 --> 06:53.659
what i need to do is practice
on the actual model,

06:53.726 --> 06:55.392
but the dean has it locked
in his office.

06:55.459 --> 06:56.759
- okay, that's easy enough.

06:56.826 --> 06:57.991
we'll go to him
and we'll ask him--

06:58.058 --> 07:01.158
- no!
this is really embarrassing.

07:01.225 --> 07:02.692
i don't want anyone
to know.

07:02.759 --> 07:03.692
i just want to figure out
how to do it

07:03.759 --> 07:05.425
and get it over with.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.459
the dean is counting on me,

07:07.525 --> 07:10.925
and i want him to know that
i'm someone he can trust.

07:10.991 --> 07:14.826
we have to break into
his office.

07:14.891 --> 07:16.392
- i actually have no problem
with that.

07:16.459 --> 07:17.891
- i think i could do that.
- mm-hmm.

07:22.792 --> 07:24.925
- oh, hello, jeffrey.
- hi, pierce.

07:24.991 --> 07:26.625
- i was just going
into the fair

07:26.692 --> 07:29.359
to wait for my
smokin'-hot date.

07:29.425 --> 07:31.158
- that's nice.
- how 'bout you?

07:31.225 --> 07:33.058
were you ever able to,
you know,

07:33.125 --> 07:35.025
come up with a, you know,
date?

07:35.092 --> 07:37.492
- no, no.
because i didn't try.

07:37.559 --> 07:40.292
because taking a date
to an std fair would be lame.

07:40.359 --> 07:41.858
- don't worry about it, kid.

07:41.925 --> 07:43.525
what you're going through
is a dry spell.

07:43.592 --> 07:45.325
from my experience,
they don't last any more

07:45.392 --> 07:48.425
than 12, 13 years.

07:48.492 --> 07:49.692
excuse me.

07:49.759 --> 07:51.025
- step right up.

07:51.092 --> 07:53.759
get a prize, not an std.

07:53.826 --> 07:55.925
oh, no, syphilis.

07:55.991 --> 07:58.325
please, please, no,
syphilis.

07:58.392 --> 08:00.759
ow, it burns!
oh, that's gonna hurt.

08:00.826 --> 08:03.425
- gross. dean, your assistant.

08:03.492 --> 08:05.359
is she single?
what are her likes and dislikes?

08:05.425 --> 08:06.925
- uh, yes on single.

08:06.991 --> 08:08.958
she likes hip-hop and horses.

08:09.025 --> 08:11.025
dislikes beards and--
yeah, i was done talking.

08:14.158 --> 08:18.958
- is it me, or are horses
the most beautiful creatures?

08:19.025 --> 08:20.525
they're so majestic.

08:20.592 --> 08:22.325
- totally.

08:22.392 --> 08:23.459
- i mean, just this morning
when i was shaving

08:23.525 --> 08:25.158
and listening to the new jay-z,

08:25.225 --> 08:26.958
i was thinking about
how i want to squeeze in

08:27.025 --> 08:28.092
a quick gallop this weekend.

08:28.158 --> 08:29.592
- do you own a horse?

08:29.659 --> 08:33.225
- can you ever really own
a horse?

08:37.625 --> 08:38.558
pierce.
- yeah.

08:38.625 --> 08:39.826
- this is sabrina.

08:39.890 --> 08:41.692
about 30 seconds after
you walked away,

08:41.759 --> 08:42.957
i asked her to be my date
for the fair,

08:43.025 --> 08:44.225
and she said yes.

08:44.292 --> 08:46.192
- oh, you must have
a great personality.

08:46.258 --> 08:47.592
- thank you.

08:47.659 --> 08:48.726
- congratulations, jeff.
you proved me wrong.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.958
you got a girl.
- yeah, i did.

08:51.025 --> 08:53.858
- oh, this is doreen.
ready for our double date?

08:53.925 --> 08:57.492
- yes, i am.
wait, how'd you do that?

09:00.272 --> 09:02.773
- is this the best
safe sex fair or what?

09:02.839 --> 09:04.472
check out these condoms.

09:04.539 --> 09:07.040
all along the side
it says "greendale"!

09:07.106 --> 09:09.472
exclamation point, my idea.

09:10.973 --> 09:16.406
- wow, me in a dune buggy.
with syphilis.

09:16.472 --> 09:17.706
this is going on the fridge.

09:17.773 --> 09:20.639
- hey, look how gorgeous
doreen is tonight.

09:20.706 --> 09:22.773
hey, can we...

09:22.839 --> 09:26.673
let's lay out our plans
for the evening.

09:26.739 --> 09:28.906
you wing man me,
i wing man you.

09:28.973 --> 09:31.839
maybe we split up
for a little hoo-ha.

09:31.906 --> 09:36.939
and then meet in the morning
for eggs and...details.

09:37.006 --> 09:40.639
- that sounds like the worst
combination plate ever.

09:42.106 --> 09:46.205
- ugh! i can't believe
you beat me again!

09:46.272 --> 09:50.305
- you want my stuffed animal?
- aah!

09:50.372 --> 09:53.606
we're arm wrestling.
ugh!

09:53.673 --> 09:54.773
- oh, like stallone
in over the top.

09:54.839 --> 09:56.140
but i'm not sure
of all the rules.

09:56.205 --> 09:57.339
don't i need a semi truck
and a ten-year-old son?

09:57.406 --> 10:01.706
- the rules are you suck!
let's go!

10:01.773 --> 10:03.106
- uh, i want to wait
for a more inspiring song.

10:03.172 --> 10:04.506
this score isn't right.

10:04.572 --> 10:06.673
there we go.

10:56.205 --> 10:58.572

10:58.639 --> 11:02.040
- hmm, let me see that.

11:02.106 --> 11:04.572
ooh, i can see

11:10.106 --> 11:11.073
- okay, go, go, go.

11:11.140 --> 11:13.706
- oh!

11:13.773 --> 11:14.973

to see.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.172
- okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay.

11:18.239 --> 11:19.572
it's okay.

11:27.406 --> 11:31.205
oh, i had it wroooong!

11:31.272 --> 11:33.106
is that considered large?

11:33.172 --> 11:34.673
- yes.
- no.

11:37.239 --> 11:41.606
- what in the reverse porky's
is going on here?

11:41.673 --> 11:45.372
- you know, doreen speaks
six languages.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.439
you should hear her order wine
in french.

11:47.506 --> 11:50.606
hey, honey, say caber-net
sauv-a-gong-da-nun.

11:50.673 --> 11:52.272
- pierce,
you're embarrassing me.

11:52.339 --> 11:54.372
- do you know a lot
about wine?

11:54.439 --> 11:57.073
- well, i did have a client
who owned a vineyard in napa.

11:57.140 --> 11:59.539
he was into s&m and merlot,

11:59.606 --> 12:02.172
so we called it s&m&m.

12:02.239 --> 12:06.106
- honey, you're boring
the crap out of jeff.

12:06.172 --> 12:09.873
- be right back.
i have to make tinkles.

12:09.939 --> 12:12.773
- well, then, i'm gonna go
get us another round.

12:12.839 --> 12:16.673
- you know, you are not
what i expected.

12:16.739 --> 12:18.506
you're smart, you're classy.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.639
you're not wearing go-go boots.

12:19.706 --> 12:22.372
- they're in the shop.

12:22.439 --> 12:23.806
you know, despite
what most people think,

12:23.873 --> 12:27.272
i actually spend
most of my time talking.

12:27.339 --> 12:29.773
as men get older,
they want to spend their time

12:29.839 --> 12:31.706
with someone they can have
a real conversation with.

12:31.773 --> 12:33.372
- that is going to suck.

12:33.439 --> 12:35.639
- "going to," jeff?

12:35.706 --> 12:37.006
look, sabrina's cute,

12:37.073 --> 12:39.939
but she thinks that monty python
is the evil snake

12:40.006 --> 12:41.272
from harry potter.

12:41.339 --> 12:44.040
- trust me, i know girls
i can converse with

12:44.106 --> 12:45.572
who are way more annoying.

12:45.639 --> 12:48.606
i will take "tinkles" over
"we need to talk" every time.

12:48.673 --> 12:50.472
- hey, babe.

12:50.539 --> 12:52.406
ready to show me that lexus?

12:52.472 --> 12:56.739
- i thought you'd never ask.

12:56.806 --> 13:00.339
doreen...it was very nice
to meet you.

13:00.406 --> 13:02.106
- you can do better.

13:09.305 --> 13:11.539
- here. rrrrr...

13:11.606 --> 13:13.739
oh, they already left?
what a couple of nincompoops!

13:13.806 --> 13:17.406
uh, before i buy dinner,
i have to ask--

13:17.472 --> 13:20.272
is there any lovemaking
on the table?

13:20.339 --> 13:22.939
- we're through, pierce.

13:23.006 --> 13:24.140
i'm gonna go to the bar,

13:24.205 --> 13:26.205
and you can join me
if you'd like.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.639
and we can still have
a lovely evening.

13:28.706 --> 13:40.234
but it will cost you 200 bucks.
- it is good discom.

13:56.519 --> 13:59.686
- i had no idea alcohol would
make people horny.

13:59.752 --> 14:01.752
makes me sleepy.
i don't...

14:01.819 --> 14:03.185
- dean.
- yeah.

14:03.252 --> 14:05.619
- we have a 597 currently
going on in your office.

14:05.686 --> 14:07.185
- a 597?

14:07.252 --> 14:10.853
there's a dog-fighting ring
in my office?

14:10.919 --> 14:13.552
okay, i'm just gonna
turn him around,

14:13.619 --> 14:15.085
and we're gonna cover him up.

14:15.152 --> 14:18.886
okay, ladies, i am shocked
at the reverse porky's

14:18.953 --> 14:20.085
that has happened here tonight.

14:20.152 --> 14:21.452
- i don't see what
the big deal is.

14:21.519 --> 14:23.919
annie just needed
to look at the model of the pe--

14:23.985 --> 14:27.319
- oh, okay, the "p" word has
entered into play.

14:27.385 --> 14:29.452
that's exactly why
i wanted gail,

14:29.519 --> 14:30.985
our school counselor, here,

14:31.052 --> 14:33.118
and monique,
who's keeping record,

14:33.185 --> 14:35.185
to ensure we discuss
these sensitive topics

14:35.252 --> 14:36.786
in a legally appropriate
manner.

14:36.853 --> 14:39.018
- i think everyone should
say penis

14:39.085 --> 14:41.886
so we can take away
the negative power of the word.

14:41.953 --> 14:43.652
yeah? so, everybody...

14:43.719 --> 14:44.786
penis.

14:44.853 --> 14:46.152
- she didn't say it.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.452
- now, why did you break in
to see the penis?

14:49.519 --> 14:50.853
wow, i really do feel

14:50.919 --> 14:52.752
more comfortable
saying that now, gail.

14:52.819 --> 14:55.085
- i just want to focus
on the girl

14:55.152 --> 14:57.452
who won't say penis.

15:06.586 --> 15:10.152
this is a judgment-free zone,
so express yourself.

15:13.853 --> 15:16.819
- you know what...

15:16.886 --> 15:19.819
i don't want
to express myself.

15:19.886 --> 15:23.385
i don't want to sit
in a room full of people

15:23.452 --> 15:25.486
and say the "p" word.

15:25.552 --> 15:27.552
i like being repressed.

15:27.619 --> 15:30.519
i am totally comfortable
being uncomfortable

15:30.586 --> 15:31.819
with my sexuality.

15:31.886 --> 15:34.586
and maybe, just maybe,

15:34.652 --> 15:36.985
if everyone were a little bit
more like me,

15:37.052 --> 15:39.886
we wouldn't have to have
an std fair.

15:39.953 --> 15:43.853
- you go, girl!
- that's my pumpkin!

15:43.919 --> 15:47.285
- by the way, now that i've
gotten a good look at one,

15:47.352 --> 15:49.118
i don't see what
all the fuss was about.

15:49.185 --> 15:53.152
a giant thumb in a turtleneck.
whoop-dee-do!

16:01.219 --> 16:05.219
- you have a really
awesome body.

16:05.285 --> 16:06.719
you probably hear that
all the time.

16:06.786 --> 16:08.118
- not as much as i should.

16:09.419 --> 16:11.786
- oh...professor...

16:11.853 --> 16:15.385
- what?

16:15.452 --> 16:16.786
i'm not a professor.

16:16.853 --> 16:20.185
- but you're at greendale...
and you're old.

16:20.252 --> 16:22.052
- i'm a student.

16:22.118 --> 16:23.786
- yikers.

16:23.853 --> 16:25.953
- yeah, it's pretty much
yikers for me too.

16:26.018 --> 16:32.052
- well, i guess i can
make an exception...professor.

16:33.786 --> 16:35.152
mmm...

16:39.519 --> 16:41.752
- you know, uh...

16:41.819 --> 16:42.953
- huh?
- i can't do this.

16:43.018 --> 16:44.252
- what?

16:44.319 --> 16:45.619
but this is your car.

16:45.686 --> 16:47.953
- keep it.
- but--

16:51.853 --> 16:54.752
yeah! yes!

16:54.819 --> 16:56.118
yes!

16:56.185 --> 16:59.118
how you like those apples?

16:59.185 --> 17:00.953
- i don't like those apples.

17:01.018 --> 17:02.919
i'm so upset.

17:02.985 --> 17:04.352
it was just a fluke
i won those other games.

17:04.419 --> 17:06.819
- troy!

17:09.285 --> 17:11.285
- wow, this may be
the only std fair

17:11.352 --> 17:12.953
to actually spread stds.

17:13.018 --> 17:15.117
- shut up, ben!

17:15.185 --> 17:18.185
- condom water balloon fight!

17:21.719 --> 17:24.252
what the hell?

17:24.319 --> 17:25.618
dude, these are leaking.

17:25.685 --> 17:27.018
- oh, my god.

17:27.085 --> 17:30.886
that's why you don't
print things on condoms.

17:30.953 --> 17:34.452
everyone's getting preggers,
and it's all your fault.

17:34.519 --> 17:36.452
oh, god, i love it.

17:40.985 --> 17:42.452
- oh, man!

17:42.519 --> 17:45.285
troy! troy,
all the condoms are faulty.

17:45.352 --> 17:49.252
as the best athlete on campus,
i need you to run to my office

17:49.319 --> 17:51.486
and make an announcement
before everyone leaves.

17:51.552 --> 17:57.552
- dean, i am not
the best athlete on campus.

17:57.619 --> 18:00.486
abed is.

18:00.552 --> 18:02.052
i know you let me win
the race.

18:02.118 --> 18:03.419
- but you didn't say anything.

18:03.486 --> 18:07.219
- that's because...
i wanted it to be true.

18:07.285 --> 18:08.752
- you're a really good friend.

18:08.819 --> 18:12.118
- no, abed...

18:12.185 --> 18:14.118
you are.

18:14.185 --> 18:15.085
- for the love of god, run!

18:15.152 --> 18:17.519
- okay.

18:17.586 --> 18:22.552
- go, abed, go,
before people sex one another!

18:26.152 --> 18:27.319
- there he is.

18:27.385 --> 18:29.752
back already.
detail time?

18:29.819 --> 18:31.419
- i stopped.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.052
i don't know
what's wrong with me.

18:33.118 --> 18:34.853
i mean, she's hot.

18:34.919 --> 18:37.285
i think this place is
sapping my life force.

18:37.352 --> 18:39.786
- oh, it's not greendale, jeff,
it's you.

18:39.853 --> 18:41.552
you're becoming more mature.

18:41.619 --> 18:43.486
i mean, a man reaches a point
in his life

18:43.552 --> 18:45.385
where he stops looking
for a place

18:45.452 --> 18:46.686
to hang his underwear

18:46.752 --> 18:49.686
and starts looking for a place
to hang his hat.

18:49.752 --> 18:53.018
- oh, i'm sorry,
i was waiting for that

18:53.085 --> 18:55.385
to become inappropriate
or racist.

18:55.452 --> 18:57.586
what happened to doreen?

18:57.652 --> 19:00.619
- oh, uh, she said if i wanted
to continue the night

19:00.686 --> 19:01.985
i'd have to pay.

19:02.052 --> 19:04.853
- oh, man, that--
that is rough.

19:04.919 --> 19:06.752
- oh, no,
it was a wake-up call.

19:06.819 --> 19:09.219
doreen's a very special lady.
i did not treat her right.

19:09.285 --> 19:11.319
i have stuff to work on,
you know?

19:11.385 --> 19:13.586
- you'll get there.

19:13.652 --> 19:19.152
we're both gonna get there.

19:19.219 --> 19:22.686
here's to being better men.

19:22.752 --> 19:24.185
- cheers.

19:24.252 --> 19:27.619
- so could i borrow
200 bucks?

19:30.652 --> 19:34.018

19:34.085 --> 19:36.953
- you know, for 220

19:37.018 --> 19:39.252

- ooh, i can get it twice.
