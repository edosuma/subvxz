00:34.257 --> 00:36.759
That man called again
this afternoon.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.262
Can't keep ignoring him, Andy.

00:41.263 --> 00:43.265
At least talk to him.

00:44.267 --> 00:46.768
I'm not gonna bow down
to them, brick.

00:46.769 --> 00:48.269
I got a responsibility

00:48.270 --> 00:49.770
to the people of this community.

00:49.771 --> 00:52.274
I'm not saying to give in, Andy,

00:52.774 --> 00:54.776
but we've got to deal with them.

00:55.276 --> 00:56.476
All right.
Let me talk to them.

00:56.777 --> 00:58.278
I know we can
work something out.

00:58.279 --> 00:59.280
No.

00:59.780 --> 01:01.281
As long as I'm president
of this company,

01:01.282 --> 01:02.783
I'll make the deals.

01:04.785 --> 01:06.287
I've been bullied
by people like this

01:06.787 --> 01:07.787
all my life.

01:07.788 --> 01:08.789
And so have you.

01:09.290 --> 01:10.291
They've already run
2 other loan companies

01:10.791 --> 01:11.791
out of business.

01:11.792 --> 01:13.293
I don't give a damn!

01:13.793 --> 01:15.295
It's not gonna happen to us.

01:18.298 --> 01:20.798
Only one way to fight them back,

01:20.799 --> 01:23.301
and that's by giving
our people fair deals.

01:23.302 --> 01:25.305
As long as we give them
fair deals,

01:25.805 --> 01:27.807
they'll support us.

01:30.309 --> 01:31.810
Andy...

01:35.814 --> 01:37.454
I know you think
you're doing what's best.

01:37.815 --> 01:38.816
I respect that.

01:39.317 --> 01:41.319
But these people
are ruthless men.

01:41.819 --> 01:42.820
They'll kill you.

01:43.321 --> 01:44.322
Listen...

01:44.323 --> 01:47.324
You've been a good partner...

01:47.325 --> 01:49.827
And we've trusted each other.

01:50.828 --> 01:52.830
There's no reason
for that to change now.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.842
I have a feeling...

02:06.843 --> 02:08.844
That we'll work this problem out

02:08.845 --> 02:10.347
the same way we have
the rest of 'em.

02:12.848 --> 02:14.350
I hope so.

02:16.352 --> 02:18.353
Brick...

02:18.354 --> 02:20.854
Will you get the lights
on your way out?

02:20.855 --> 02:22.857
I'll go out the back way.

02:23.359 --> 02:23.859
Good night.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.361
Good night.

04:17.964 --> 04:19.964
Ok, we're just gonna mess
the place up a little bit,

04:19.966 --> 04:21.466
let him know we mean business.

04:21.468 --> 04:22.969
Killer: You mean
we can't steal nothin'?

04:22.970 --> 04:24.472
Hammerhead:
No. Come on.

04:32.979 --> 04:34.479
Stop!
Somebody's here!

04:34.480 --> 04:35.980
God damn right there's somebody!

04:35.981 --> 04:37.483
Somebody's right here!

04:55.500 --> 04:57.180
Hammerhead: Come on,
let's get out of here!

04:58.002 --> 04:59.503
Come on, whale.

Racker: Just make sure
we get our money,

08:24.695 --> 08:25.696
because the next time

08:26.196 --> 08:28.197
that we have to talk
to your jive ass about this,

08:28.698 --> 08:31.701
my partner's gonna
stomp the hell out of you.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.210
Well, well...

08:41.711 --> 08:44.212
My long lost partner returns.

08:44.212 --> 08:47.215
Just be thankful I did, racker.

08:51.219 --> 08:53.720
Look at this place!

08:53.721 --> 08:56.222
I go away for 3 days,
and I come back

08:56.223 --> 08:58.225
and the whole place
has gone to pot!

09:09.737 --> 09:11.237
Ohh.

09:14.741 --> 09:17.744
This came for you
a couple of days ago.

09:35.259 --> 09:37.260
Why didn't you try
to reach me about this?

09:37.261 --> 09:40.765
Why didn't I try to reach you?

09:40.766 --> 09:44.267
Why haven't I tried to find
a needle in a haystack?

09:44.268 --> 09:46.269
How in the hell do I know
where you hang out at?

09:46.270 --> 09:49.272
Why don't you try looking
once in a while?

09:49.273 --> 09:51.775
Getting up off of
that fat Fanny of yours

09:51.776 --> 09:53.776
and going out into the world?

09:53.777 --> 09:55.779
Maybe try a little working.

09:58.282 --> 09:59.783
Ohh.

09:59.784 --> 10:01.283
Well...

10:01.284 --> 10:03.285
Is it important?

10:03.286 --> 10:05.287
What do you think?

10:05.288 --> 10:07.790
Well, take care
of the place, partner.

10:07.791 --> 10:10.292
I'll be in Louisville
if you need me.

10:11.293 --> 10:13.295
Louisville?

10:58.839 --> 10:59.839
Hi, Sheba.

11:00.339 --> 11:01.339
How you doing?

11:01.340 --> 11:02.340
Fine.

11:02.341 --> 11:03.843
I'm so glad you came.

11:04.343 --> 11:05.844
I'm glad I came, too.
How's dad?

11:05.845 --> 11:07.845
Oh, he's all right.

11:07.846 --> 11:10.347
He's a little bruised up,
but, you know, he's tough.

11:10.348 --> 11:12.349
That I know.

11:12.350 --> 11:13.350
Yeah.
Come on.

11:13.351 --> 11:14.853
Brick:
You look terrific.

11:38.375 --> 11:39.876
Oh, brick...

11:39.877 --> 11:43.378
You said in the telegram
dad's life was in danger.

11:43.379 --> 11:45.881
I'm afraid it is.

11:45.882 --> 11:47.883
You see, he's been
getting phone calls

11:47.884 --> 11:49.384
for 2 weeks now

11:49.385 --> 11:51.385
demanding we sell out.

11:51.386 --> 11:53.889
Really?
From who, loan Sharks?

11:54.389 --> 11:54.890
Maybe.

11:55.390 --> 11:56.893
We don't know yet.

11:57.893 --> 11:59.393
And dad?

11:59.394 --> 12:01.395
He wants to fight 'em...

12:01.396 --> 12:02.397
Single-handed...

12:02.898 --> 12:04.899
Which is what happened
the other night.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.367
And the police didn't
do anything, right?

12:07.368 --> 12:08.870
Right.

12:14.375 --> 12:17.377
What... what are
their demands?

12:17.378 --> 12:18.880
Very simple.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.382
Sell out or be killed.

12:21.883 --> 12:22.884
Ohh...

12:23.383 --> 12:25.886
Do they have a fight
on their hands.

12:53.912 --> 12:54.912
Ooh.

12:54.913 --> 12:56.415
Doesn't the neighborhood
look good?

12:57.415 --> 12:59.416
Want me to take these
in for you?

12:59.417 --> 13:00.417
Uh...

13:00.418 --> 13:02.920
No, I think I better
go in alone.

13:02.921 --> 13:04.422
Ok.

13:06.423 --> 13:08.925
How much do I owe you for this?

13:08.926 --> 13:10.927
I'll collect on it later.

13:10.928 --> 13:13.429
Hmmph.
Promises, promises.

13:31.446 --> 13:33.448
You're looking better
all the time.

13:33.949 --> 13:35.449
Little Andy!

13:35.450 --> 13:37.453
What are you doing home?

13:38.454 --> 13:39.453
Ohh.

13:39.454 --> 13:40.454
Oh, girl.

13:40.455 --> 13:42.456
I came to see you.

13:42.457 --> 13:43.958
Hey, you look good.

13:43.959 --> 13:44.960
Come on, sit down.

13:45.460 --> 13:46.960
No, you sit down.
Come on.

13:46.961 --> 13:48.462
Look at you.

13:55.970 --> 13:57.971
Now what happened?

13:57.972 --> 13:59.973
Just ran into some
of the wrong people,

13:59.974 --> 14:00.974
I guess.

14:00.975 --> 14:03.476
I can't let you out
of my sight for 5 minutes

14:03.477 --> 14:04.977
before you get
into some trouble.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.478
Oh, girl, come on.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.480
Dad...

14:07.981 --> 14:10.482
Brick told me what's going on.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.484
I told him not to call you.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.488
There's no need for you
to get involved in this.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.489
We just don't wanna
see you get hurt.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.992
Well, there's nothin'
anybody can do.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.492
I have to work it out myself.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.995
Not anymore.

14:23.996 --> 14:26.998
I want you to stay out
of this, little Andy.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.000
I don't want my daughter
messing around

14:29.500 --> 14:30.501
with these kind of people.

14:32.003 --> 14:32.804
Dad...

14:33.004 --> 14:35.349
I know you think
I'm doing a man's job...

14:35.407 --> 14:36.208
Ohh...

14:36.408 --> 14:38.910
But I'm not going
to sit on the sidelines

14:38.911 --> 14:40.912
just because I'm a woman.

14:42.914 --> 14:44.413
Ah, no, you sit right there.

14:44.414 --> 14:45.415
I'll get it.

14:49.419 --> 14:50.099
Shayne residence.

14:50.419 --> 14:51.921
Pilot:
Let me talk to Andy.

14:52.421 --> 14:53.421
Who's calling?

14:53.422 --> 14:54.422
Well, who's asking?

14:54.423 --> 14:56.925
This is Sheba, his daughter.

14:56.926 --> 14:58.927
Well, good for you,
sweet sister.

14:58.928 --> 15:00.929
Let me talk to your old man.

15:03.431 --> 15:04.431
This is Andy Shayne.

15:04.432 --> 15:05.932
Pilot: Hello, Andy.

15:05.933 --> 15:07.433
Feeling better today?

15:07.434 --> 15:09.435
I thought I told you
to stop calling me.

15:09.436 --> 15:10.936
I just wanted to know

15:10.937 --> 15:12.938
if you've given my proposition
some more thought.

15:12.939 --> 15:16.442
My company is not for sale.
Not now, not ever!

15:17.443 --> 15:18.944
What was that all about?

15:18.945 --> 15:20.945
Ah, it's nothin', baby.
Forget about it.

15:20.946 --> 15:22.446
Forget about it?

15:22.447 --> 15:23.448
I come home

15:23.949 --> 15:25.449
and find my father
beaten half to death

15:25.450 --> 15:27.450
and hear some sweet-talkin'
nigger threaten his life,

15:27.451 --> 15:28.952
and you say forget about it?

15:28.953 --> 15:30.955
Dad, what is going on?

15:33.456 --> 15:35.459
I'll be ready
for those bastards.

15:40.964 --> 15:42.463
Thank you,
Mr. Williams.

15:42.464 --> 15:44.465
I don't expect
any problems on this,

15:44.466 --> 15:46.967
but if anything comes up,
I'll give you a call.

15:46.968 --> 15:48.969
I can reach you at this
number here, right?

15:48.970 --> 15:50.971
Man: Right, sir.

15:50.972 --> 15:52.972
Brick: Ok.

15:52.973 --> 15:55.476
Brick: That ought
to do fine.

15:58.979 --> 16:00.479
Hi. Is my father in?

16:00.480 --> 16:01.982
He's in his office.

16:04.483 --> 16:05.483
Mmm.

16:05.484 --> 16:07.485
Hi. You busy?

16:07.486 --> 16:09.486
Oh, just filling out
some insurance forms.

16:09.487 --> 16:10.988
Can I have the car?

16:10.989 --> 16:11.990
Sure.

16:12.990 --> 16:14.992
Thank you.

16:14.993 --> 16:16.493
I'll pick you up this afternoon.

16:16.494 --> 16:17.495
Thank you.

16:27.003 --> 16:28.503
Yes.

16:28.504 --> 16:30.004
Pilot: Hey, Andy.

16:30.005 --> 16:31.505
How's your sweet daughter today?

16:31.506 --> 16:34.008
Hey, I tell you what...

16:34.009 --> 16:36.511
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

16:39.013 --> 16:40.014
Mmm.

16:41.015 --> 16:42.516
All right, we'll talk.

16:43.017 --> 16:45.018
You mean you wanna talk?

16:47.520 --> 16:49.520
You set the time and the place.

16:49.521 --> 16:51.522
Hey, that's great.

16:51.523 --> 16:54.526
I've gotta tell you something.

16:54.527 --> 16:56.528
I had a surprise package

16:57.029 --> 16:59.530
connected to your
ignition switch

16:59.531 --> 17:01.031
in your car,

17:01.032 --> 17:02.532
triggered to go off

17:02.533 --> 17:04.035
10 seconds
after you turned it on.

17:08.038 --> 17:10.039
Sheba!
It's a bomb!

17:10.040 --> 17:11.040
Sheba!

17:13.041 --> 17:14.544
Sheba!

17:16.545 --> 17:17.046
Sheba!
Sheba!

17:17.546 --> 17:18.546
Get out of that car!

17:18.547 --> 17:20.048
Quick, quick!
Get out!

17:20.049 --> 17:23.050
Come on!
Get out of there!

17:23.050 --> 17:25.551
Come on! Move, move!
Get out of here! Move!

17:25.553 --> 17:27.054
Damn it, move!

17:29.556 --> 17:31.557
Oh, my God.

17:34.561 --> 17:36.562
Shit!

17:45.070 --> 17:48.071
So you wanna handle it
all by yourself, huh?

17:48.072 --> 17:50.573
Now, Sheba, we had an agreement.

17:50.574 --> 17:54.078
That agreement just blew up
in that car!

17:55.079 --> 17:56.079
Sheba.
Sheba.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.080
Sheba!

17:57.081 --> 17:58.581
Oh, my God.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.103
Homicide.
Lieutenant Jackson.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.104
All right, lady.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.106
I'll see what we can do,

18:28.107 --> 18:31.608
but there's no need for
you to call back again.

18:31.609 --> 18:33.611
Because if this thing
can be solved,

18:33.612 --> 18:35.112
we'll solve it.

18:35.113 --> 18:36.113
Yeah. Yeah.

18:36.114 --> 18:37.615
Good-bye.

18:38.616 --> 18:41.117
Heard you were back
in town, Sheba.

18:41.118 --> 18:43.120
Chicago must be
treating you good.

18:45.121 --> 18:46.122
I have a feeling

18:46.622 --> 18:48.623
this isn't a social call.

18:48.624 --> 18:51.125
I want police protection
for my father.

18:51.126 --> 18:53.628
Well, I can't
make anybody on that.

18:53.629 --> 18:55.630
Should I take this

18:56.131 --> 18:57.131
as a refusal
of police protection?

18:57.132 --> 18:59.633
Oh, come on, Sheba.

18:59.634 --> 19:02.135
We're doing everything we can.

19:02.136 --> 19:04.637
I can't give him
24-hour protection

19:04.638 --> 19:07.639
because I don't have
enough men available.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.141
I know.

19:09.142 --> 19:11.642
You don't wanna break up
their poker game!

19:11.643 --> 19:14.646
We're doing everything
humanly possible for him.

19:14.647 --> 19:17.148
Oh, the great humanitarian now.

19:17.149 --> 19:20.151
Phil, I've seen business
after business go under.

19:20.152 --> 19:21.652
First, it was the pawn shops.

19:22.153 --> 19:23.153
Then, the bars.

19:23.154 --> 19:24.654
When I left town,
it was employment agencies,

19:24.655 --> 19:26.155
and now the used car lots.

19:26.156 --> 19:27.656
Stay out of this, Sheba.

19:27.657 --> 19:30.159
Stay out of this?

19:30.160 --> 19:32.161
That's your job.

19:32.162 --> 19:33.662
After all the times

19:33.663 --> 19:35.664
I went to bat for you
around here,

19:35.665 --> 19:36.664
thanks a lot.

19:36.665 --> 19:37.666
Huh.

19:38.167 --> 19:39.887
I can count the times
you went to bat for me

19:40.169 --> 19:42.170
on one finger.

20:40.720 --> 20:41.720
Sheba Shayne.

20:41.721 --> 20:43.223
What are you doing back in town?

20:43.723 --> 20:44.723
Don't give me that

20:45.224 --> 20:46.584
"what you doing back
in town" shit.

20:46.725 --> 20:48.226
Was it you that wired
my father's car?

20:48.227 --> 20:50.227
Wired? What wired?

20:50.228 --> 20:51.230
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:51.730 --> 20:54.731
Maybe you do,
and maybe you don't.

20:54.732 --> 20:57.235
But if you didn't,
I know you know who did.

20:57.735 --> 20:59.236
Now wait a minute.

20:59.237 --> 21:01.238
Wait. What do you want
from me?

21:01.738 --> 21:02.738
Why me?

21:02.739 --> 21:06.241
Because I know
everything you do.

21:06.242 --> 21:08.243
Remember, I was a cop
in this town.

21:08.244 --> 21:09.745
Oh, please.

21:10.245 --> 21:11.246
I don't know anything.

21:11.247 --> 21:12.747
The hell you don't!

21:12.748 --> 21:13.748
Now wait a minute.

21:13.749 --> 21:15.749
Let go of my arm.
Baby, don't!

21:15.750 --> 21:17.751
Don't, please.
Please! Please!

21:17.752 --> 21:18.753
Get over there.

21:19.254 --> 21:19.754
No, please.

21:20.255 --> 21:22.255
Aah. I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:22.256 --> 21:23.756
I don't know anybody...

21:23.757 --> 21:25.757
you never know anything
I'm talking about!

21:25.758 --> 21:27.260
Please take it easy, Sheba.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.261
Aah.

21:28.761 --> 21:29.762
Come on, please. Aah.

21:30.263 --> 21:32.264
One move, and I'll blow
your head clean off.

21:32.265 --> 21:33.765
All right, I won't move.
I won't move.

21:33.766 --> 21:35.767
But please
don't shoot me. Please!

21:35.768 --> 21:36.768
Please!

21:37.269 --> 21:39.270
Please. Aah.
I don't know anything.

21:39.271 --> 21:40.271
I swear it!

21:40.272 --> 21:41.771
You better tell me all you know,

21:41.772 --> 21:43.273
or you're gonna be
the whitest nigger

21:43.274 --> 21:44.774
that ever left Louisville!

21:44.775 --> 21:46.276
I don't know nothing.

21:46.277 --> 21:47.776
Get in there!

21:47.777 --> 21:49.278
Aah!

21:49.279 --> 21:50.780
Oh! Ok.

21:50.781 --> 21:51.781
Ok.

21:51.782 --> 21:53.282
There's a guy...

21:53.283 --> 21:54.783
Name of Jenkins...

21:54.784 --> 21:56.285
Works the used car lot.

21:56.286 --> 21:57.285
Where?

21:57.286 --> 21:59.787
I don't know!
I swear it!

21:59.788 --> 22:02.289
Aah!

22:02.290 --> 22:03.790
Oh. All right.

22:03.791 --> 22:05.292
All right.

22:05.293 --> 22:06.793
Tonight at midnight,

22:06.794 --> 22:09.295
he's gonna be
at the railroad museum.

22:09.296 --> 22:10.797
Some kind of payoff.

22:10.798 --> 22:12.299
That's all I know!
I swear it!

22:12.300 --> 22:13.299
Swear?

22:13.300 --> 22:14.300
Yes.

22:14.301 --> 22:16.302
Aah!

22:16.303 --> 22:17.803
Aah! Oh!

22:17.804 --> 22:19.304
If I have to wait...

22:19.305 --> 22:21.806
if I have to wait
until midnight,

22:21.807 --> 22:23.307
you better be tellin' me
the truth,

22:23.308 --> 22:25.310
or your ass is mine,
you hear me?

22:30.315 --> 22:31.815
Brick: I'll tell ya...

22:31.816 --> 22:33.317
Sheba: What?

22:33.318 --> 22:35.819
I got something planned
for later.

22:37.321 --> 22:39.321
What do you have planned
for later?

22:39.322 --> 22:40.822
I'm not gonna tell you now.

22:40.823 --> 22:42.325
Stop pinching me.

22:43.826 --> 22:44.825
Come here.

22:44.826 --> 22:45.827
That hurt.

22:47.829 --> 22:49.830
Wow. Isn't it
beautiful?

22:49.831 --> 22:51.833
Oh, it's fantastic.

22:53.335 --> 22:54.834
So, listen, uh...

22:54.835 --> 22:56.836
What'd you find out today?

22:56.837 --> 22:58.338
Well, dad was right.

22:58.339 --> 23:01.341
The police
are not going to help.

23:02.342 --> 23:03.842
So now what?

23:03.843 --> 23:05.343
Well, now I do

23:05.344 --> 23:06.845
what the police won't.

23:09.348 --> 23:11.349
What are you talking about?

23:11.350 --> 23:12.850
I'm talking about the hoods

23:12.851 --> 23:14.852
that wired dad's car.

23:14.853 --> 23:16.353
They're meeting
at midnight tonight

23:16.354 --> 23:17.854
for some big business meeting.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.613
I plan to catch them in the act.

23:23.361 --> 23:24.862
Listen...

23:25.363 --> 23:26.864
I wanna tell you something.

23:27.365 --> 23:29.868
You know that private
detective badge you carry?

23:30.369 --> 23:33.371
Now, that is not a warrant
to arrest anybody with.

23:33.372 --> 23:34.872
And second of all,

23:34.873 --> 23:37.375
we're not equipped
to fight a bunch like that...

23:37.376 --> 23:38.876
not on their terms.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.378
That's the only way
to fight 'em,

23:40.379 --> 23:41.879
is on their terms.

23:41.880 --> 23:42.880
Not outside the law!

23:42.881 --> 23:44.382
We'll just have to bend the law.

23:44.383 --> 23:45.883
This is dad's life
we're talking about.

23:45.884 --> 23:47.885
I know that!
Don't you think I know that?

23:47.886 --> 23:48.886
I understand that,

23:48.887 --> 23:50.389
but you can't handle it
by street fighting,

23:50.390 --> 23:51.390
for Christ's sake.

23:51.391 --> 23:53.392
Well, who said anything
about street fighting?

23:53.393 --> 23:55.394
Do I look like
I'm a street fighter?

23:55.395 --> 23:58.897
I'm gonna handle it
the best way I can, brick.

23:58.898 --> 24:00.399
You know, you still think

24:00.400 --> 24:02.401
everything can be solved
by logic.

24:02.402 --> 24:04.403
These people don't even
know what logic means.

24:04.404 --> 24:05.904
They can't even spell it.

24:05.905 --> 24:07.406
They'll shoot first
and talk later.

24:07.407 --> 24:09.409
That's exactly
what I'm trying to tell you!

24:09.410 --> 24:10.910
I don't want you to go out there

24:10.911 --> 24:12.412
and get your God damn
brains blown out!

24:12.413 --> 24:13.913
We've got to find a better way!

24:13.914 --> 24:15.416
Well, then you find it.

24:32.934 --> 24:34.936
Brick: You mad?

24:36.438 --> 24:37.438
No.

24:37.439 --> 24:38.940
You sure?

24:39.941 --> 24:41.943
I'm sure, I'm sure.

24:43.445 --> 24:44.946
Prove it.

24:46.948 --> 24:48.451
Ha ha! Hey, don't.

24:48.951 --> 24:50.953
Don't do that. Come on.

24:51.954 --> 24:53.456
Hey, look...

24:54.457 --> 24:55.958
I'm sorry I hollered at you.

24:56.459 --> 24:57.460
Ok?

24:58.461 --> 24:59.962
I accept your apology.

25:00.463 --> 25:01.464
All right.

25:03.466 --> 25:04.967
I wanna ask you something.

25:05.468 --> 25:06.968
Hmm.

25:06.969 --> 25:08.972
Uh...

25:10.974 --> 25:12.976
You like living in Chicago?

25:14.478 --> 25:16.979
It's as good a place as any
to get hassled.

25:16.980 --> 25:18.482
It's no big thing.

25:20.984 --> 25:22.986
Uh, ahem.

25:23.487 --> 25:25.489
Do you have someone there?

25:26.990 --> 25:28.492
Well, if you're asking if...

25:28.493 --> 25:30.995
do I sleep alone
every night of the week,

25:31.496 --> 25:33.498
I'd have to say no.

25:33.998 --> 25:34.999
And then again,

25:35.500 --> 25:36.501
if you're asking

25:37.001 --> 25:38.281
if I'm going
with someone steady,

25:38.503 --> 25:39.504
I'd have to say no.

25:40.004 --> 25:42.507
So what are you asking?

25:45.510 --> 25:50.015
♪
radio: ♪♪ I don't want
to complicate your life... ♪

25:50.516 --> 25:52.518
See? I told you
you'd been missing a lot.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.970
Ooh. I know.

25:55.971 --> 25:56.971
Unh!

25:56.972 --> 25:57.973
Ow!

25:59.975 --> 26:00.975
That's it.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.478
That was a love bite.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.491
Hey, it's 11:30.

26:16.492 --> 26:17.993
No, it isn't.

26:17.994 --> 26:18.995
Clock's fast.

26:19.495 --> 26:19.996
Uh-uh-uh.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.999
Don't give me that
"clock's fast."

26:25.501 --> 26:27.504
I'm going with you.

26:28.505 --> 26:30.507
I thought you didn't
want to get involved

26:31.008 --> 26:32.009
in any violence.

26:32.509 --> 26:33.510
Do I have a choice...

26:34.011 --> 26:35.012
Now?

26:35.512 --> 26:36.513
Yep.

26:37.014 --> 26:38.015
Mm-mmm.

26:39.016 --> 26:41.518
Not if I want
a repeat of tonight.

26:46.023 --> 26:47.525
Ohh.

26:49.027 --> 26:50.528
Mmm.

26:52.030 --> 26:54.032
What am I going to do with you?

26:57.535 --> 26:59.037
Whatever you want.

27:03.541 --> 27:04.542
You know...

27:07.046 --> 27:09.547
It's times like this when...

27:09.548 --> 27:11.550
I wish I hadn't left.

27:15.054 --> 27:17.056
Times like this
when I wish you hadn't.

27:52.093 --> 27:53.594
Get down.

28:07.109 --> 28:09.611
I think we've got company.

28:29.132 --> 28:30.633
Hey, pilot.

28:32.635 --> 28:34.136
Here are all the deeds
and tax forms

28:34.137 --> 28:36.139
you wanted from the loan
company on 23rd street.

28:36.639 --> 28:39.141
Man, I wish all the deals
were that easy to take over.

28:39.142 --> 28:41.143
Walk in,
show a little pistol power,

28:41.144 --> 28:43.145
they give it up
like a birthday present.

28:43.146 --> 28:45.648
This makes your share...

28:46.150 --> 28:48.152
Amount to about $30,000.

28:49.153 --> 28:51.654
Don't ever say that pilot
ever welched on a deal.

28:51.655 --> 28:53.156
You keep this up, pilot,

28:53.157 --> 28:55.158
you'll own all the loan shops

28:55.159 --> 28:56.659
in the west end.

28:56.660 --> 28:58.161
Never mind what I own.

28:58.162 --> 29:00.663
We'll have all
the loan shops we can get

29:00.664 --> 29:02.166
soon as Shayne quits.

29:05.169 --> 29:06.171
Who the hell is that?

29:10.675 --> 29:12.177
Who are you?

29:13.678 --> 29:17.182
Let's get the hell
out of here!
Aah!

31:01.791 --> 31:02.792
Let's split!

31:04.295 --> 31:06.296
Sheba!

31:06.297 --> 31:07.798
Damn you!

31:10.801 --> 31:11.801
Oh!

31:11.802 --> 31:12.803
Brick!

31:15.806 --> 31:17.307
Look at my face,

31:17.308 --> 31:18.808
'cause I am pissed!

31:18.809 --> 31:20.810
I mean, I'm really pissed!

31:20.811 --> 31:24.315
And I'm not gonna
let you forget it.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.816
That's right.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.319
Damn right.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.821
That damn Sheba.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.824
You want her hit?

31:33.825 --> 31:35.327
Hell, no!

31:37.329 --> 31:39.331
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.337
The business was going so smooth

31:45.338 --> 31:47.339
until that bitch came into town.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.341
That's right.

31:48.841 --> 31:50.843
Now it ain't nothin'
like it used to be.

31:52.845 --> 31:55.347
We had a terrific
operation going...

31:55.348 --> 31:57.849
the best pawn shops
and used car lots

31:57.850 --> 31:59.351
in the city!

31:59.352 --> 32:01.353
People were lined up for blocks

32:01.354 --> 32:04.857
just waitin' to put
their money in our shops.

32:04.858 --> 32:05.378
That's right.

32:05.859 --> 32:07.360
And we'd take 'em for a ride.

32:07.361 --> 32:09.362
That's right.

32:09.363 --> 32:11.365
We got tough people
in the black community.

32:11.865 --> 32:14.867
They expect us
to take their money.

32:14.868 --> 32:16.369
Why, even a tornado

32:16.370 --> 32:18.372
didn't stop them
from giving it to us.

32:24.879 --> 32:25.879
Pilot: Right?

32:25.880 --> 32:26.881
That's right.

32:29.384 --> 32:31.386
If that bitch Sheba...

32:31.886 --> 32:34.888
Wants to make trouble for us...

32:34.889 --> 32:37.392
Then we gonna
give her some back.

32:42.397 --> 32:43.898
I think I found something

32:43.899 --> 32:46.402
that ties our company with
the others who went under.

32:48.404 --> 32:49.405
Hmm.

32:49.905 --> 32:51.406
Something or someone?

32:51.407 --> 32:53.408
Wait a minute.
Let me tell you.

32:53.409 --> 32:55.910
I've gone over
every possible angle,

32:55.911 --> 32:58.414
and the one thing
we have in common...

32:58.914 --> 33:00.415
insurance.

33:00.416 --> 33:01.916
I don't get it.

33:01.917 --> 33:03.919
We're all insured
by the same outfit.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.421
So you think

33:05.422 --> 33:06.922
the insurance company
is behind it?

33:06.923 --> 33:08.924
Well, it's a possibility.

33:08.925 --> 33:10.926
Don't you think so?

33:10.927 --> 33:12.929
Ok, now everybody do exactly
as they're told,

33:13.430 --> 33:14.430
and nobody'll get hurt.

33:14.431 --> 33:15.932
Everybody over against the wall

33:16.433 --> 33:18.435
with your hands
behind your heads.

33:21.438 --> 33:22.438
Hey, what's going on out here?

33:22.439 --> 33:24.442
Everybody move over
against the wall.

33:24.942 --> 33:26.944
Hey, you can't come in here
and tell me what to do!

33:27.445 --> 33:28.445
Be quiet, dad.

33:28.446 --> 33:29.446
Get away from me!

33:29.447 --> 33:30.947
You just keep
your mouth shut, nigger,

33:30.948 --> 33:32.449
or I'll blow a hole
in your head.

33:32.450 --> 33:34.451
Now, wait a minute, buddy.

33:34.452 --> 33:36.453
Uh, wait a minute.

33:36.454 --> 33:38.955
Look, we don't have
any money in here.

33:38.956 --> 33:40.957
There's nothing for you to rob.

33:40.958 --> 33:42.460
We don't want your money.

33:44.963 --> 33:47.466
All right,
let's redecorate the place.

34:35.014 --> 34:36.516
No.

34:36.516 --> 34:37.518
Please, don't kill me.

34:44.525 --> 34:46.027
I don't wanna die.

34:47.529 --> 34:49.029
Sheba!

34:49.030 --> 34:52.533
No.
No, please! Please!

34:52.534 --> 34:53.534
Sheba!

34:54.034 --> 34:55.034
Thug: No, please. No.

34:55.036 --> 34:56.536
Hold it, lady.

34:56.538 --> 34:58.540
Be cool and put that gun down.

35:18.060 --> 35:20.062
Get him out of here.
Hurry!

35:22.566 --> 35:25.068
I want an ambulance
over here. Right now!

35:48.593 --> 35:50.594
You know what
we're gonna do, dad,

35:50.595 --> 35:52.096
when you get out of here?

35:54.098 --> 35:56.100
We're gonna go to Chicago.

35:59.103 --> 36:00.604
And I'm gonna...

36:00.605 --> 36:03.609
I'm gonna take you for a ride
out on the lake.

36:07.112 --> 36:09.615
It's really beautiful
there at night.

36:11.116 --> 36:15.621
Y-you can sit on top of one
of those cruising boats...

36:17.623 --> 36:20.124
And watch the lights
twinkle on the water

36:20.125 --> 36:22.629
like nothing you've ever seen.

36:31.137 --> 36:34.140
And then we're gonna hit
the finest restaurants.

36:35.141 --> 36:37.143
Yes, sirree.

36:39.145 --> 36:40.146
Little Andy's gonna see

36:40.647 --> 36:42.649
that her father gets
the very best...

36:42.650 --> 36:45.152
very, very best.

put me out of business?!

39:16.811 --> 39:18.813
Go on, get down there!

39:20.816 --> 39:22.316
You! Talk!

39:22.317 --> 39:24.318
I gave the order
for no one to be killed.

39:24.319 --> 39:27.321
No rough stuff.
Just shoot the place up.

39:27.322 --> 39:29.824
Well, somebody
didn't follow orders.

39:29.825 --> 39:32.326
And not only did somebody
get killed,

39:32.327 --> 39:35.329
but the men who were supposed
to do a clean job

39:35.330 --> 39:37.832
are on a slab
in the general hospital

39:37.833 --> 39:39.334
or squealing to the cops.

39:39.335 --> 39:42.337
They're outside people.
They don't know anybody.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.339
You better be right,

39:44.340 --> 39:47.342
or you'll be pushing up
black daisies along with me.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.845
That Sheba broad
don't know who you are.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.847
You 2 gorillas better pray

39:51.848 --> 39:55.851
that that broad's daddy
don't die...

39:55.852 --> 39:57.853
Or there ain't gonna be
a safe place

39:57.854 --> 39:59.355
for you to shit in this town,

39:59.356 --> 40:01.358
much less than live.

40:09.366 --> 40:10.366
Yeah.

40:10.367 --> 40:11.367
Hey, Walker.

40:11.368 --> 40:12.368
Hey, man.

40:12.369 --> 40:14.370
Oh, man.

40:14.371 --> 40:16.372
Come on, man.
Come on back here.

40:16.373 --> 40:17.374
Shit.

40:17.875 --> 40:20.377
Look, man, I got problems, man.

40:20.378 --> 40:21.978
Let me hear something
I ain't heard, man.

40:22.380 --> 40:23.381
Oh, no, no, no. Listen.

40:23.882 --> 40:24.883
My old lady's going
to throw my ass out

40:25.383 --> 40:26.884
if I don't bring home
some money.

40:26.885 --> 40:29.386
I need some cash
in a hurry, man.

40:29.387 --> 40:32.389
Well, you know the terms.
What you got for collateral?

40:32.390 --> 40:35.393
Here. This ought to be
worth something.

40:45.404 --> 40:47.906
Ok, that'll get you 5, man.

40:47.907 --> 40:49.407
$5.00?

40:49.408 --> 40:50.909
Nigger, is you crazy?

40:50.910 --> 40:52.912
That watch is worth
more than $5.00.

40:53.412 --> 40:54.412
Hey, look, am I number one?

40:54.413 --> 40:55.915
Does number one yeah.
Jive?

40:56.415 --> 40:56.916
No, man.

40:57.416 --> 40:58.417
It'll get you 5, sucker.

40:58.418 --> 41:00.921
Now you got anything else?

41:02.422 --> 41:03.924
Here.
What about this?

41:23.444 --> 41:26.446
Aw, man, not all this
lightweight shit.

41:26.447 --> 41:29.450
Lightweight, man? That's
worth cash money, man.

41:51.473 --> 41:55.477
Get you $25...
10% interest a week.

42:01.484 --> 42:02.484
Thanks, man.

42:02.485 --> 42:04.085
I'll get it back to you
as soon as I can.

42:04.487 --> 42:04.988
Mm-hmm.

42:05.488 --> 42:07.490
Take your time, man.
It's your money.

42:07.991 --> 42:10.492
Hey, Sheba, I heard
you were back in town.

42:10.493 --> 42:11.995
Hi, tank.
How you been doing?

42:12.495 --> 42:13.496
Oh, just fine, baby...

42:13.997 --> 42:15.999
Tank, who do you know

42:16.499 --> 42:19.002
that would have a contact for
shutting down a loan company?

42:19.003 --> 42:21.504
Well...

42:21.505 --> 42:24.007
There's a dude over there
called Walker.

42:24.008 --> 42:25.508
He cruises around town,

42:25.509 --> 42:27.010
sort of like
a traveling pawn shop.

42:27.011 --> 42:28.512
A loan Shark,
you know what I mean?

42:29.013 --> 42:30.013
Mm-hmm.

42:30.014 --> 42:31.014
If there's anybody in town

42:31.015 --> 42:32.015
who knows the big loan money,

42:32.016 --> 42:33.517
I'm sure it's Walker
who can help you.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.519
Mm-hmm.

42:36.020 --> 42:36.520
Thanks a lot.

42:36.521 --> 42:38.523
You're welcome, baby.

42:50.035 --> 42:52.536
Mm-hmm.

42:52.537 --> 42:55.039
Mr. wonderful himself.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.540
I'll bet you're Walker.

42:56.541 --> 42:59.544
Mm-hmm. Number one
in the flesh, mama.

42:59.545 --> 43:00.545
Er, uh...

43:00.546 --> 43:03.048
Er, uh, who are you?

43:03.049 --> 43:05.550
The name's Sheba...
Sheba Shayne.

43:05.551 --> 43:07.552
Sheba Shayne?

43:07.553 --> 43:09.554
Hmm. Heh.

43:09.555 --> 43:12.058
Well, miss fine Sheba Shayne,

43:12.558 --> 43:15.560
you tell number one
what he can do for you.

43:15.561 --> 43:17.563
Number one,
what you can do is...

43:17.564 --> 43:19.065
I want to buy something.

43:19.066 --> 43:22.068
Yeah.
Heh heh heh!

43:22.069 --> 43:24.570
What you need I got,

43:24.571 --> 43:27.573
and anything you want I can get.

43:27.574 --> 43:29.075
And if you're ready
for that shit,

43:29.076 --> 43:31.577
let's just step around
to my private warehouse.

43:31.578 --> 43:33.079
Heh heh!

43:33.080 --> 43:35.581
Whoo-ooh!

43:35.582 --> 43:37.585
Don't bruise.
Don't bruise.

43:38.586 --> 43:42.589
You know, you sure know
how to make a man's day.

43:42.590 --> 43:45.092
I can make quite
a few more for you, too.

43:45.093 --> 43:47.595
Ha! Oh, go on, mama.

43:57.106 --> 44:00.109
I don't want any of that junk.

44:00.609 --> 44:03.111
You don't want any of this junk?

44:03.112 --> 44:05.113
Well, what the hell
do you want, bitch?

44:05.114 --> 44:07.115
I want some information.

44:07.116 --> 44:09.117
Do I look like the colored
bureau of information?

44:09.118 --> 44:11.119
What you mean,
information? About what?

44:11.120 --> 44:12.680
Who knocked off
the Shayne loan company?

44:13.122 --> 44:14.123
Shayne?

44:16.126 --> 44:17.626
Aw, shit.

44:17.627 --> 44:19.628
What's the matter, nigger?

44:19.629 --> 44:20.629
Who's hitting on you?

44:20.630 --> 44:22.131
Look, I... I don't know
nothing.

44:22.132 --> 44:24.634
Look, I don't know nothing.
I ain't got nothing to tell.

44:25.135 --> 44:26.135
What's the game, man?

44:26.136 --> 44:27.256
You better tell me something.

44:27.637 --> 44:29.138
Hey, look, I told you,
stay away from me, bitch.

44:29.139 --> 44:31.259
I don't know nothing. I ain't
got nothing to tell you.

44:31.641 --> 44:32.641
I don't know nothing.

44:32.642 --> 44:33.643
You better talk, big man,

44:34.144 --> 44:35.645
before I put my number one foot

44:35.646 --> 44:37.147
down your number one mouth.

44:37.148 --> 44:38.648
Shit!

44:38.649 --> 44:41.152
You can't kick no shadow,
bitch! Catch me!

45:20.693 --> 45:22.195
Shit!

45:49.223 --> 45:51.725
Oh, shit!
What the... shit!

45:53.727 --> 45:56.230
Hi there, Walker.

45:56.231 --> 45:57.731
Wait a minute.
W-what you going to do

45:57.732 --> 45:59.233
with that gun, mama?

45:59.234 --> 46:01.735
Nothing, if you roll down
that window.

46:01.736 --> 46:02.736
Roll what?

46:02.737 --> 46:03.737
I said roll down that window

46:03.738 --> 46:05.739
before I blast a hole
in your head.

46:05.740 --> 46:07.741
Are you crazy?
It'll ruin my interior.

46:07.742 --> 46:09.743
No kidding.

46:09.744 --> 46:12.747
I'm going to give you 5 seconds

46:13.248 --> 46:14.248
to tell me something

46:14.249 --> 46:16.251
before I shove your face
through that window.

46:16.252 --> 46:17.253
You hear me?

46:22.258 --> 46:25.261
I... I... I don't know
nothing.

46:27.263 --> 46:28.763
Do you swear?

46:28.764 --> 46:29.924
I swear.
I don't know nothing.

46:30.266 --> 46:31.767
I'm not going to ask you again.

46:33.269 --> 46:36.773
Why you trying to be
so mean to me?

46:40.277 --> 46:42.779
Do I have to remind you
you ordered hot wax?

46:43.280 --> 46:44.281
Oh, shit!

46:46.283 --> 46:48.785
I told you...
I... I don't know nothing.

46:49.286 --> 46:50.786
He'll kill me
if I told you his name.

46:50.787 --> 46:52.789
Well, at least you have
a 50-50 chance.

46:55.293 --> 46:57.794
Now, with me,
you're dead for sure.

46:57.795 --> 46:59.297
Now tell me. Talk!

46:59.797 --> 47:00.797
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

47:00.798 --> 47:02.299
Pilot... his name is pi...

47:02.300 --> 47:03.300
all I know is his nickname.

47:03.301 --> 47:04.302
His nickname is pilot.

47:05.803 --> 47:07.305
Where does he live?

47:07.805 --> 47:08.805
I told you.
I don't know.

47:08.806 --> 47:11.309
Look, I just take orders.
I don't know nothing.

47:11.809 --> 47:13.310
Well, if you take orders,
you know where he lives.

47:13.311 --> 47:14.713
Oh, ok, ok, ok.

47:14.813 --> 47:16.771
Look, see, I think
he's got a pad

47:16.815 --> 47:17.858
over at the 400 towers,

47:17.917 --> 47:20.671
but, see, he don't
live there no more. Uh...

47:21.119 --> 47:23.563
I know... I know he doesn't.
Look, I don't know.

47:23.598 --> 47:24.337
All right, now listen.

47:24.423 --> 47:25.224
Yeah?

47:25.624 --> 47:26.624
Now you tell your boss

47:26.625 --> 47:28.627
that he is not dealing
with my father anymore.

47:28.628 --> 47:30.129
He is dealing with Sheba Shayne.

47:30.130 --> 47:31.131
You hear me?
Yeah!

47:31.631 --> 47:33.634
And when I find him, I'm going
to bust his ass wide open.

47:33.635 --> 47:34.635
Yeah.

47:34.636 --> 47:35.136
Ohh!

47:41.644 --> 47:43.646
What do you mean,
you told her where I live?

47:43.647 --> 47:44.648
I'm sorry, pilot.

47:45.149 --> 47:46.649
You see... you see,

47:46.650 --> 47:48.152
that bitch would've
killed me, man,

47:48.153 --> 47:51.155
if I hadn't told her
who you was, man.

47:51.156 --> 47:52.657
No, you... you don't
understand.

47:52.658 --> 47:54.160
Look, man, pilot.

47:54.161 --> 47:55.661
Pilot!
Look, man, this...

47:55.662 --> 47:58.165
look, this is me,
your number one dude.

47:58.166 --> 48:00.167
Now, you know I wouldn't have...

48:00.168 --> 48:02.671
I wouldn't have
turned you in, man.

48:03.172 --> 48:04.672
She put a...

48:04.673 --> 48:06.675
Yeah, one of them
to my head, man... a Magnum!

48:06.676 --> 48:09.178
You better hide
your face, nigger,

48:09.179 --> 48:11.181
because when I get that bitch

48:11.182 --> 48:12.183
I'm coming after you.

48:12.683 --> 48:14.003
Wait a minute, pilot.
Let me ex...

48:14.686 --> 48:16.189
what? What?

48:18.691 --> 48:20.192
Pilot. Wait a minute,
pilot. Pilot!

48:20.193 --> 48:21.194
Pilot!

48:21.195 --> 48:22.695
I'm going to get that bitch

48:22.696 --> 48:25.700
if it's the last thing
that I do.

48:27.702 --> 48:29.703
And that Walker dude,

48:29.704 --> 48:32.207
I want him eliminated
off the face of the world.

48:32.208 --> 48:33.710
We'll take care of it, boss.

48:34.211 --> 48:37.214
So the bitch knows
how to find me, huh?

48:37.215 --> 48:39.216
Well, we'll just have to prepare

48:39.217 --> 48:40.719
a welcoming party for her.

49:23.273 --> 49:24.273
Hello?
Brick?

49:24.274 --> 49:26.275
Did you find those
papers I asked about?

49:26.276 --> 49:29.279
These are all I could find
in the safety deposit box.

49:29.280 --> 49:30.780
I'm sure the necessary
papers are here.

49:30.781 --> 49:32.784
Now, listen,

49:32.785 --> 49:35.287
the hood that hit dad
is a guy called pilot.

49:35.288 --> 49:36.288
I'm going after him.

49:36.289 --> 49:38.291
Where the hell are you?
I'm going with you.

49:38.292 --> 49:40.794
No. Good-bye.

52:17.992 --> 52:20.495
Damn, boss, we'll never
find her in all this mess.

52:20.496 --> 52:23.500
Nigger, you'd better
hope the hell we do.

53:55.616 --> 53:57.618
Where are your other friends?

54:17.644 --> 54:19.646
God damn it! Shit!

54:22.149 --> 54:23.150
Hey!

54:39.671 --> 54:41.172
Lay the gun down.

54:41.173 --> 54:43.174
Right there.

54:43.175 --> 54:45.176
Over to the wall.

54:45.177 --> 54:47.179
Spread your legs apart.

54:47.180 --> 54:51.186
Move your head, I'm
going to blow it off.

54:51.687 --> 54:52.688
Oh, shit!

54:56.693 --> 54:58.194
There's that bitch!

55:06.705 --> 55:08.206
Unh!

55:09.208 --> 55:10.710
You better not be pilot,
or you're a dead man.

55:10.711 --> 55:12.713
I'm not pilot. I'm not
the guy you want.

55:14.215 --> 55:15.717
Unh! Uhh!

55:50.761 --> 55:52.764
Ohh!

55:57.269 --> 55:59.270
Now, before I turn you in,

55:59.271 --> 56:00.772
you tell me about
your operation,

56:00.773 --> 56:03.276
and you better tell me fast,
before you lose your head.

56:05.278 --> 56:07.782
Come on. Please!

56:10.786 --> 56:13.789
Tell me who your head man is!

56:13.790 --> 56:15.791
Shark.

56:15.792 --> 56:17.294
That's all I know.

56:19.797 --> 56:23.300
You liar!

56:23.301 --> 56:24.803
What is his number?

56:25.805 --> 56:28.809
W, v, 7, 3...

56:30.812 --> 56:33.314
9, 4, 1.

56:33.815 --> 56:36.317
Now you tell your boss,
if you see him before I do,

56:36.318 --> 56:38.319
that the lady is after his ass,

56:38.320 --> 56:40.360
and you are proof I always
get my man, you got that?

56:45.830 --> 56:47.330
If you don't get her
out of this town,

56:47.331 --> 56:49.835
I'm going to put you
out of business permanently,

56:49.836 --> 56:51.336
and I mean that.

56:51.337 --> 56:53.338
Now where is she?

56:53.339 --> 56:55.842
How the hell do I know?
That's the reason I'm here.

56:55.843 --> 56:58.344
If people would only
stop meddling

56:58.345 --> 57:00.848
and let the police
do their work!

57:00.849 --> 57:02.850
Look, we tried that.
Don't you remember?

57:02.851 --> 57:03.852
It didn't work!

57:03.853 --> 57:05.353
I know that!

57:05.354 --> 57:06.354
Then what are you trying
to tell me, huh?

57:06.355 --> 57:07.858
We've got to stop her!

57:09.360 --> 57:10.361
Now...

57:10.862 --> 57:13.866
Do you have any idea
who she's after?

57:16.368 --> 57:18.371
Some... some guy named pilot.

57:41.901 --> 57:42.902
"Shark."

58:04.929 --> 58:07.432
This is the operator.
May I help you?

58:07.433 --> 58:09.434
Yes. I'm trying to reach

58:09.435 --> 58:12.940
wv 739 41.

58:13.440 --> 58:14.600
Sorry, that's a marine number.

58:14.943 --> 58:16.443
I'll connect you
to the mobile operator.

58:16.444 --> 58:17.445
One moment.

58:19.447 --> 58:20.448
Woman:
Mobile operator.

58:20.449 --> 58:24.954
Yes. I would like
wv 739 41.

58:24.955 --> 58:27.458
One moment, please.
I'll connect you.

58:30.462 --> 58:33.965
Man: Nu-tronic...
wv 739 41.

58:33.966 --> 58:37.469
Uh, is this where
the party's at?

58:37.470 --> 58:40.473
I'm supposed to be
there, but I got lost.

58:40.474 --> 58:42.976
How'd you get this number?

58:42.977 --> 58:44.478
I got it.

58:44.479 --> 58:45.981
Now how do I get there?

59:04.004 --> 59:05.504
Hi. I'm supposed to be
at the party.

59:05.505 --> 59:06.506
Yeah, you're late.

59:06.507 --> 59:07.509
I got lost.

59:08.010 --> 59:09.511
All right.

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:14.593
Wait a second.
He's busy.

01:00:21.101 --> 01:00:22.602
A new guest.

01:00:23.103 --> 01:00:24.604
Welcome aboard.

01:00:24.605 --> 01:00:27.108
Why, thank you.
So, you're the host.

01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:29.111
You have a reputation
of being the best.

01:00:29.112 --> 01:00:31.113
It depends on
how well you know me.

01:00:31.114 --> 01:00:33.616
Well, that can be arranged.

01:00:33.617 --> 01:00:36.119
You seem to move very fast.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.622
I guess that's why
they call you Shark.

01:00:38.623 --> 01:00:40.124
Could be.

01:00:40.125 --> 01:00:42.627
Can I, uh...

01:00:42.628 --> 01:00:46.132
Get you a drink, beautiful lady?

01:00:46.133 --> 01:00:48.635
Champagne and orange juice.

01:00:48.636 --> 01:00:50.137
Well, hello, sweetie.

01:00:50.138 --> 01:00:52.140
Will I see you later?

01:00:52.141 --> 01:00:54.642
Of course.

01:00:54.643 --> 01:00:58.648
We'll all get to be
good friends.

01:01:36.696 --> 01:01:38.698
All right.

01:01:50.714 --> 01:01:52.715
Unh! Unh! Unh!

01:01:52.716 --> 01:01:54.218
Unh!

01:01:54.219 --> 01:01:55.720
Woman: Oh!

01:01:57.222 --> 01:01:59.224
Aah!

01:01:59.225 --> 01:02:01.226
Man: Hit her again!
Hit her again!

01:02:01.227 --> 01:02:02.727
Come on!

01:02:02.728 --> 01:02:04.231
That's it!
That's it!

01:02:18.749 --> 01:02:20.251
Woman: Ohh! Ohh!

01:02:25.758 --> 01:02:27.760
I told you never to come here!

01:02:27.761 --> 01:02:28.762
I got to talk to him.

01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:39.774
Sorry to bother you,
Shark, but, uh...

01:02:39.775 --> 01:02:41.777
Get that trash off my boat.

01:02:41.778 --> 01:02:44.281
You got to listen to me, Shark.

01:02:44.282 --> 01:02:46.284
Now, she's coming.
She knows.

01:02:46.285 --> 01:02:48.286
Who the hell you talking about?

01:02:48.287 --> 01:02:49.788
The Shayne chick.

01:02:51.291 --> 01:02:52.292
It's her...

01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:54.294
the Shayne chick!

01:02:57.798 --> 01:02:58.799
Crowd: Aw!

01:04:05.384 --> 01:04:08.888
Come on, get your ass up.

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:12.392
Tomorrow morning,
you're going to regret

01:04:12.393 --> 01:04:14.395
this mistake of yours.

01:04:15.896 --> 01:04:17.398
If I was trying to take over,

01:04:17.399 --> 01:04:19.400
would I come
back here to warn you?

01:04:19.401 --> 01:04:22.404
The reasons
make no difference now.

01:04:22.405 --> 01:04:25.408
You've put me
in a bad situation.

01:04:25.409 --> 01:04:27.911
A lot of things
have to be cleared up,

01:04:27.912 --> 01:04:29.913
and you're one of them.

01:04:29.914 --> 01:04:31.916
No, Shark.
Please!

01:04:31.917 --> 01:04:32.918
Get him out of here.

01:04:33.419 --> 01:04:33.919
Let's go.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:35.922
Slimy nigger.

01:07:50.618 --> 01:07:52.620
Give me that, bitch.
Unh!

01:07:56.124 --> 01:07:58.627
I'm surprised you're not
smarter than this.

01:08:02.633 --> 01:08:05.135
Wait outside.

01:08:05.136 --> 01:08:09.140
She won't give us
any trouble now.

01:08:14.648 --> 01:08:17.149
I'm going to have
to kill you, you know that?

01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:19.153
But all your friends saw me.

01:08:21.657 --> 01:08:25.161
You did leave the party
in a hurry.

01:08:28.666 --> 01:08:32.669
Have I bruised your masculinity?

01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:34.673
Not really.

01:08:36.675 --> 01:08:39.176
It would take more than
one chick to do that.

01:08:39.178 --> 01:08:41.180
Would it?

01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:04.711
I ought to take you.

01:09:05.712 --> 01:09:07.212
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:09:07.214 --> 01:09:08.716
Try me.

01:09:16.225 --> 01:09:18.227
Ohh!

01:09:20.731 --> 01:09:22.733
Ohh.

01:09:22.734 --> 01:09:25.738
Now, what's that done
to your masculinity?

01:09:38.252 --> 01:09:39.755
You little slut.

01:09:40.256 --> 01:09:41.758
You've done your last trick...

01:09:42.258 --> 01:09:44.761
your last trick, sweetheart.

01:09:46.263 --> 01:09:48.264
Now you listen,

01:09:48.265 --> 01:09:49.768
and you listen good.

01:09:50.268 --> 01:09:53.270
I hereby sentence you to death.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.776
Before we're finished with you,

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:59.781
you're going to be Shark bait.

01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:08.792
Put her below.

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:10.794
Man: Let's go.

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:36.902
Homicide.
Sergeant Michaels.

01:11:37.402 --> 01:11:39.906
No, Williams,
he's not in right now.

01:11:39.907 --> 01:11:40.907
I don't have any idea.

01:11:40.908 --> 01:11:41.909
Hold it.

01:11:44.913 --> 01:11:46.413
Homicide.
Lieutenant Jackson.

01:11:46.414 --> 01:11:47.734
Brick: Lieutenant?
Brick Williams.

01:11:47.916 --> 01:11:48.516
Yeah, Williams.

01:11:48.918 --> 01:11:49.919
Find your girlfriend?

01:11:50.419 --> 01:11:52.379
What do you know about
a boat called the nu-tronic?

01:11:52.421 --> 01:11:55.424
Oh. That yacht
out on the river?

01:11:55.425 --> 01:11:56.425
Yeah, I guess.

01:11:56.426 --> 01:11:58.430
Belongs to a man
named Merrill...

01:11:59.932 --> 01:12:02.433
a rich guy with
all the right answers.

01:12:02.434 --> 01:12:03.436
Why?

01:12:03.937 --> 01:12:05.939
I think Sheba's
gotten herself in too deep.

01:13:17.028 --> 01:13:18.529
But, Shark,

01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:20.532
I've done everything
you've told me to do.

01:13:20.533 --> 01:13:22.034
Now, you know that, boss.

01:13:22.035 --> 01:13:24.538
I've run a good shop for you.

01:13:25.039 --> 01:13:26.539
You said so yourself last month.

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:29.044
You did,

01:13:29.544 --> 01:13:32.546
but you're too much of
an insurance risk for me.

01:13:32.547 --> 01:13:33.548
You've screwed up too much.

01:13:33.549 --> 01:13:35.050
Please, Shark!

01:13:35.051 --> 01:13:37.054
I've always done right by you.

01:13:37.554 --> 01:13:38.555
Ask anybody.
Come on.

01:13:38.556 --> 01:13:40.057
Ask any one of the boys.

01:13:40.058 --> 01:13:42.059
Please.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:44.063
Now, don't be loud
about this, pilot.

01:13:44.563 --> 01:13:46.064
Come on! Please!

01:13:46.065 --> 01:13:48.567
Wait until I get back
to the boat.

01:13:48.568 --> 01:13:50.569
Shark!

01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:53.073
Please, Shark!

01:13:53.074 --> 01:13:54.575
Come on, Shark!

01:14:01.585 --> 01:14:04.087
I'll give you anything.

01:14:04.088 --> 01:14:05.588
Anything.

01:14:05.589 --> 01:14:06.590
What do you want, huh?

01:14:06.591 --> 01:14:07.591
Huh? What do you want, huh?

01:14:07.592 --> 01:14:09.593
You want... you want
some money? Huh?

01:14:09.594 --> 01:14:11.596
I'll give you money.
I got lots of money.

01:14:11.597 --> 01:14:12.597
Huh? You want
some broads? Huh?

01:14:12.598 --> 01:14:14.599
I got all kinds of broads, huh?

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.105
What's
your hang-up, huh?

01:14:20.609 --> 01:14:21.610
Please.

01:14:23.112 --> 01:14:25.614
I can't swim.

01:14:25.615 --> 01:14:26.616
Please!

01:14:30.121 --> 01:14:31.121
Pilot:
Give me a break.

01:14:31.122 --> 01:14:33.123
Come on, man, please.

01:14:33.124 --> 01:14:35.626
I've been working
with you guys. You know me.

01:14:35.627 --> 01:14:37.130
Come on, you can let me go.

01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:39.131
He'll never know.

01:14:39.132 --> 01:14:40.133
Aw, come on, man.

01:14:40.134 --> 01:14:41.634
Don't do that.

01:14:41.635 --> 01:14:43.137
Hey, listen, it's me.

01:14:59.158 --> 01:15:01.159
You can't do this to me.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.160
Come on!

01:15:02.161 --> 01:15:04.164
Look, I don't want to die!

01:15:10.671 --> 01:15:12.173
Please!

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:17.680
The show's about to start.

01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:18.681
You're going to see just a taste

01:15:18.682 --> 01:15:20.684
of what we've got
in store for you,

01:15:21.185 --> 01:15:21.685
sweet lady.

01:15:23.188 --> 01:15:25.108
I'll tell you what that
means, sucker! Let me go!

01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:27.193
Front row seats.

01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:57.730
Wait until you see what
we've got planned for you.

01:15:57.731 --> 01:16:00.233
So what are your big plans?

01:16:00.234 --> 01:16:02.237
Nothing complicated.

01:16:03.738 --> 01:16:05.740
I always like
to keep things simple.

01:16:05.741 --> 01:16:07.242
After I dispose of you,

01:16:07.243 --> 01:16:10.247
I... I'll have to take a short
vacation for a while.

01:16:10.747 --> 01:16:13.249
I knew no one legitimate

01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:15.253
could own a boat like this.

01:16:17.756 --> 01:16:19.258
Yacht, my dear.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.263
I'm afraid we're going
to have to tie you up.

01:16:24.264 --> 01:16:28.269
I hope that doesn't
interfere with your plans.

01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:31.773
Your humor stinks.

01:16:33.775 --> 01:16:36.779
Do you have trouble
sleeping at night?

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:40.284
From taking money from
stupid, ignorant people?

01:16:40.285 --> 01:16:41.785
No.

01:16:41.786 --> 01:16:44.790
You have to admire a man
for the goals that he sets.

01:16:51.298 --> 01:16:53.300
I think I'm going to be sick.

01:16:53.301 --> 01:16:55.803
I like it out here.

01:16:55.804 --> 01:16:59.308
It's quiet.

01:16:59.309 --> 01:17:03.313
It gets me away from
all the shit in the city.

01:17:03.314 --> 01:17:04.814
I don't see how.

01:17:04.815 --> 01:17:09.321
You seem to bring it
all along with you.

01:17:13.326 --> 01:17:15.829
Shark: This was really
all so unnecessary.

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:19.833
I'm going to get the Shayne
loan company anyway.

01:17:19.834 --> 01:17:22.338
Since Andy is dead,

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:26.342
my insurance company
takes over his operation.

01:17:26.343 --> 01:17:28.344
Andy owed us a fortune

01:17:28.345 --> 01:17:29.846
in premium payments.

01:17:31.349 --> 01:17:35.354
You get them coming
and going, don't you?

01:17:36.856 --> 01:17:39.358
It's the name of the game.

01:17:39.359 --> 01:17:41.361
With a marked deck.

01:17:41.362 --> 01:17:42.863
Of course.

01:17:44.365 --> 01:17:45.867
Anything worth having...

01:17:46.868 --> 01:17:47.869
Is worth stealing.

01:17:49.871 --> 01:17:51.874
The lady is ready for her swim.

01:17:52.375 --> 01:17:53.376
No way!

01:17:56.881 --> 01:17:57.881
Go ahead!

01:17:57.882 --> 01:17:58.883
Pull her!

01:18:21.412 --> 01:18:22.912
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:18:22.913 --> 01:18:25.417
The police are coming.

01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:44.592
Aah!

01:22:48.247 --> 01:22:49.750
Unh!

01:24:08.849 --> 01:24:11.353
Brick.

01:24:13.355 --> 01:24:14.856
Oh.

01:24:14.857 --> 01:24:16.358
Are you all right?

01:24:16.359 --> 01:24:19.862
Yes, yes. Just take me
away from here.

01:24:19.863 --> 01:24:21.365
Come on.

01:24:24.368 --> 01:24:26.871
And you can have
your town back again,

01:24:26.872 --> 01:24:28.372
lieutenant.

01:24:28.373 --> 01:24:29.374
Yeah.

01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:51.903
If you should change your mind,

01:24:51.904 --> 01:24:54.406
this... this is your home.

01:24:54.407 --> 01:24:55.909
No, brick.
I got to go.

01:24:58.412 --> 01:24:59.914
I could go to Chicago.

01:25:03.919 --> 01:25:05.920
And leave the business?

01:25:05.921 --> 01:25:07.421
No way.

01:25:07.422 --> 01:25:09.425
You've got a good thing going.

01:25:10.427 --> 01:25:11.929
Visit?

01:25:13.431 --> 01:25:15.432
I'll come and visit you.

01:25:15.433 --> 01:25:17.436
I have to check
all my interest with you.

01:25:38.963 --> 01:25:40.464
Take care of yourself.

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.483
Don't, brick.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:56.485
What?

01:25:57.987 --> 01:26:00.990
Let's just let it go right here.

01:26:00.991 --> 01:26:01.992
Ok.

01:26:58.563 --> 01:27:00.065
Driver:
Where to, lady?

01:27:02.068 --> 01:27:03.069
Lady?

01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:05.571
To the airport.

01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:24.290
