Commander Bly, we've got company.

01:08.303 --> 01:10.343
- Friendlies?
- Negative, sir.

01:10.468 --> 01:11.568
A droid ship

01:12.091 --> 01:13.791
<i>coming straight our way.</i>

01:13.916 --> 01:15.825
Acknowledged. Get back here.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.080
- General?
- Yes, commander?

01:21.374 --> 01:23.290
We've got a Separatist ship
incoming.

01:23.659 --> 01:25.259
This is neutral space.

01:25.384 --> 01:28.688
It won't be neutral for long,
not if the Separatists have their way.

01:30.025 --> 01:32.318
- Help me up.
- Don't struggle.

01:32.716 --> 01:35.616
I'm sorry,
but you're still too injured to move.

01:44.947 --> 01:47.897
What menace have you brought
to our village now, Jedi?

01:48.413 --> 01:50.363
Father, you can't blame them.

01:50.488 --> 01:53.446
He's right. The Separatists
don't even know we're here.

01:53.692 --> 01:55.948
And they can't know.
We've got to hide.

01:56.354 --> 01:58.451
Your presence here endangers us.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.786
You must leave
before your enemies find you.

02:01.125 --> 02:04.081
But you'll need our help.
You can't fight them alone.

02:04.449 --> 02:06.449
We will not fight them at all.

02:06.574 --> 02:08.627
We would rather die
than to kill others.

02:08.991 --> 02:10.792
You're going to surrender?

02:11.180 --> 02:13.530
- But how can you...
- Ahsoka, stop.

02:13.968 --> 02:17.887
If the Lurmen want to remain neutral,
we won't force them into war.

02:18.456 --> 02:20.055
See to it that they leave.

02:20.454 --> 02:22.904
I must see
what our new visitors want.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.824
Take it easy, sir.
We'll assist you.

02:48.138 --> 02:50.788
I am General Lok Durd

02:50.913 --> 02:52.713
of the Separatist alliance.

02:53.014 --> 02:55.923
I am Tee Watt Kaa,
leader of this colony.

02:56.205 --> 02:59.024
- What do...
- You are now under the protection

02:59.149 --> 03:00.999
of the Separatist alliance.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.168
I congratulate you

03:03.488 --> 03:05.038
on your good fortune.

03:05.695 --> 03:09.696
Thank you, but we enjoyed good fortune
well before your arrival.

03:15.824 --> 03:17.863
We are a peaceful people, General.

03:17.988 --> 03:20.070
I do not condone your presence here.

03:20.195 --> 03:21.582
Then stand aside.

03:21.907 --> 03:24.979
I would like to inspect
my new colony.

03:28.783 --> 03:31.085
Ransack this dung heap.

03:38.267 --> 03:40.564
Why are they tearing apart
our homes?

03:40.689 --> 03:42.539
We've done nothing to them!

03:42.811 --> 03:43.761
Violence,

03:44.024 --> 03:46.267
that's what those droids
are programmed for.

03:48.572 --> 03:50.104
Can't we do anything?

03:50.515 --> 03:53.941
No, and if we are discovered,
all of the Lurmen will be slaughtered.

03:54.666 --> 03:57.528
We'll be okay
if we make it to the tall grasses.

04:09.127 --> 04:12.859
There is no evidence of any weapons
or Republic contraband, General.

04:13.533 --> 04:17.380
In the future, we may conduct
more periodic searches

04:17.548 --> 04:21.345
like this one
in order to maintain security.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.805
Because we are
such an obvious threat to you.

04:25.712 --> 04:27.183
We'll offer no resistance.

04:27.570 --> 04:30.573
Your species is smarter
than you appear.

04:39.448 --> 04:40.998
Father, are you okay?

04:45.458 --> 04:47.102
At least the Jedi escaped.

04:47.227 --> 04:50.577
Yes, but they nearly brought harm
to our entire village.

04:51.507 --> 04:52.916
But now, thanks to you,

04:53.085 --> 04:56.545
we're safe to grovel before every
petty tyrant who enters our system.

04:56.849 --> 04:59.005
You would mock our very way of life?

04:59.332 --> 05:01.258
I have just ensured
we will have peace.

05:01.642 --> 05:04.292
Yes, but for the moment,
and at what price?

05:04.863 --> 05:07.598
Are you not concerned
about the Jedi at all?

05:07.817 --> 05:09.917
I have no quarrel with the Jedi,

05:10.301 --> 05:13.270
but we cannot help them
without being drawn into their war.

05:16.902 --> 05:18.402
Tub, track the Jedi.

05:18.804 --> 05:21.554
Follow them
and make sure they get off world.

05:27.732 --> 05:30.830
You know, I can't figure those villagers
not wanting to fight.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.305
No pride I guess.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.345
I call it no courage.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.796
Sometimes it takes courage to stick
to one's beliefs, young padawan,

05:38.968 --> 05:40.618
as any Jedi well knows.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.925
We need to find a ship,

05:43.258 --> 05:46.262
and I think the only one around here
belongs to the Separatists.

05:46.586 --> 05:49.056
We know they have a landing ship.
They might have a shuttle.

05:50.891 --> 05:54.241
Sir, you talking about stealing
from one of the clankers?

05:54.737 --> 05:57.487
- Count me in.
- We need to find them first.

05:59.928 --> 06:01.193
I think we just did.

06:03.029 --> 06:03.984
Blast it!

06:06.414 --> 06:07.664
Jam its signal!

06:08.160 --> 06:09.110
After it!

06:14.369 --> 06:15.769
I'm fine. Just go!

06:23.239 --> 06:25.839
- Which way did it go?
- This way. Hurry!

06:47.100 --> 06:49.199
We can't catch it
if it gets out in the open.

07:02.712 --> 07:05.799
- I wonder where it was headed.
- Maybe we can see them from up there.

07:12.811 --> 07:15.161
I hope you're feeling better,
Master,

07:15.560 --> 07:17.019
'cause look what we found.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.230
I'm getting stronger
all the time, snips.

07:22.821 --> 07:25.073
But I'm not sure I'm ready for that.

07:47.853 --> 07:49.894
That shuttle's
our ticket off this rock.

07:50.019 --> 07:51.559
It's not gonna be easy, sir.

07:51.684 --> 07:55.034
There don't seem to be any flaws
in their security line.

08:11.804 --> 08:14.196
Apparently,
the Separatists have a new toy.

08:14.321 --> 08:16.695
- See if you can get a closer look.
- Yes, sir.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.720
I'll go with you, Commander.

08:25.139 --> 08:27.714
Is the defoliator capsule ready?

08:29.928 --> 08:33.924
Today is a grand day
for the Separatist cause.

08:34.899 --> 08:37.087
We test a new weapon

08:37.931 --> 08:39.520
of my own design

08:40.227 --> 08:44.169
which is capable
of catastrophic destruction,

08:45.256 --> 08:48.567
a weapon which will destroy
organic matter

08:49.274 --> 08:51.655
but leave machines

08:52.321 --> 08:53.271
unharmed.

08:58.779 --> 08:59.779
But first,

09:00.655 --> 09:02.408
we need two volunteers.

09:05.998 --> 09:07.398
The volunteers are

09:07.805 --> 09:09.548
you and you.

09:10.167 --> 09:11.267
- Me?
- Me?

09:11.745 --> 09:13.010
Go to that ridge.

09:13.810 --> 09:14.960
Roger, roger.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.687
Stay down, boys.

09:26.561 --> 09:27.953
Count Dooku,

09:28.676 --> 09:31.528
I have located a world
in which we can test my...

09:32.228 --> 09:33.491
Excuse me,

09:34.212 --> 09:35.598
our new weapon.

09:37.182 --> 09:40.308
<i>I hope it turns out
to be worth the expense.</i>

09:40.919 --> 09:42.080
<i>You may proceed.</i>

09:42.922 --> 09:44.875
Yes, my Lord. Ready?

09:46.242 --> 09:47.294
Roger, roger.

09:47.717 --> 09:48.461
Aim.

09:51.885 --> 09:52.635
Fire!

09:59.980 --> 10:01.530
Should we take cover?

10:01.655 --> 10:03.852
No, idiot.
That is not even gonna hit us.

10:23.254 --> 10:24.654
That's some toy...

10:25.414 --> 10:27.956
It took out every living thing.

10:30.083 --> 10:31.384
As you can see,

10:31.811 --> 10:34.027
the landscape has been destroyed,

10:34.652 --> 10:37.315
and the droids are undamaged.

10:37.987 --> 10:39.094
<i>Impressive,</i>

10:39.539 --> 10:41.466
<i>but now, we need to know</i>

10:41.591 --> 10:44.191
<i>how effective
this weapon will be against</i>

10:44.377 --> 10:45.727
<i>living creatures.</i>

10:46.408 --> 10:47.496
Of course.

10:47.956 --> 10:51.938
I specifically chose this planet
because it is inhabited.

10:52.588 --> 10:56.029
The colonists will make
excellent test subjects.

10:56.609 --> 10:57.809
<i>Proceed, then.</i>

10:58.456 --> 11:00.658
<i>I eagerly await the results.</i>

11:02.228 --> 11:04.031
Prepare to move out!

11:05.205 --> 11:07.005
Where are they off to now?

11:07.130 --> 11:09.722
They must be going back
to the Lurmen village.

11:09.847 --> 11:11.837
There's nothing else
in that direction.

11:12.147 --> 11:14.257
Those villagers
won't stand a chance.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.721
First we'll take out the droids'
communication station.

11:16.846 --> 11:19.136
After we get a shuttle,
we'll go back and help them.

11:19.482 --> 11:22.848
But Tee Watt Kaa said
he doesn't need our help.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.994
There's a difference
between pulling innocents into a war

11:26.119 --> 11:27.769
and leaving them to extinction.

11:37.612 --> 11:40.562
Tell Wag Too
that the Separatists are returning.

12:04.747 --> 12:06.197
Hey, what was that?

12:32.672 --> 12:35.222
Get to the door.
I'll handle the droids.

13:11.141 --> 13:12.457
Check the exterior.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.425
We cannot have any surprises
for the General.

13:16.311 --> 13:19.274
4724, how does the west end
check out?

13:19.539 --> 13:20.465
What the...

13:23.848 --> 13:27.389
The Separatists are on the march.
They're returning to our village.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.586
They did not attack us before.

13:29.711 --> 13:32.001
There's no reason to think
they will this time.

13:32.126 --> 13:34.060
Father, they wouldn't be
coming back here

13:34.185 --> 13:37.398
unless they intended to do us harm.
This is war!

13:37.692 --> 13:39.159
But not our war.

13:39.643 --> 13:41.455
We've done nothing to provoke them,

13:41.580 --> 13:43.447
and we will not.
That is their way.

13:43.799 --> 13:46.041
So we will just lay down
and be slaughtered?

13:46.166 --> 13:48.560
Father, even if we don't fight
the Separatists,

13:48.685 --> 13:50.328
we must defend ourselves!

13:50.646 --> 13:53.496
Mounting a defense
is still engaging in battle.

13:53.621 --> 13:57.121
If we sacrifice our beliefs,
we're no better than they are.

13:57.390 --> 14:00.338
Our philosophy has helped us
to survive for generations,

14:00.598 --> 14:03.448
and we will not change
our morals now or ever.

14:09.647 --> 14:12.697
- Shield generator, sir.
- Let's take 'em with us.

14:48.858 --> 14:50.958
Everyone, please, please listen.

14:51.213 --> 14:53.099
The Separatists will be here
in moments.

14:53.438 --> 14:56.488
What are you doing here?
I told you not to return.

14:56.938 --> 15:00.065
I'm afraid the Separatists don't care
whether you're in the war or not.

15:00.349 --> 15:02.484
We need to get you to safety
before they arrive.

15:02.825 --> 15:04.736
We will not abandon our homes.

15:05.174 --> 15:08.874
But they've got a new weapon.
It'll burn this place to a crisp.

15:09.453 --> 15:11.660
Is this what all of you really want?

15:12.026 --> 15:15.026
If it is our destiny to be destroyed
in your war,

15:15.832 --> 15:16.782
so be it.

15:27.753 --> 15:30.104
Droids inbound.
We've got eight minutes tops.

15:30.229 --> 15:32.722
Come on, guys. Let's get
these shield generators in place!

15:40.370 --> 15:42.726
When Count Dooku sees how successful

15:42.851 --> 15:45.301
my weapon is
against civilian targets,

15:45.704 --> 15:47.585
I will no doubt be promoted

15:47.780 --> 15:48.880
to a more...

15:49.480 --> 15:52.334
Substantial position
within the alliance.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.046
Right.

15:55.677 --> 15:59.077
Well, the villagers appear
to have put some pods together

15:59.202 --> 16:01.852
- in a barrier around the village.
- Pods?

16:04.150 --> 16:05.455
How quaint.

16:08.187 --> 16:08.937
Jedi?

16:09.345 --> 16:11.645
What are they doing out here?
Halt!

16:16.603 --> 16:18.503
Pray stop what you're doing.

16:18.628 --> 16:20.328
Stop building that wall.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.857
- I did not ask you to defend us.
- This battle is inevitable.

16:24.304 --> 16:27.654
You can stand by your beliefs,
but let us stand by ours.

16:30.653 --> 16:33.103
Thank you
for what you're trying to do.

16:33.310 --> 16:36.360
I'm sorry, but I cannot help.
My father is very...

16:37.355 --> 16:39.539
Strong willed and set in tradition.

16:40.051 --> 16:41.564
Many others agree with me,

16:41.689 --> 16:43.982
but we were raised
under a very strict code.

16:44.107 --> 16:46.807
We must respect it,
even if we don't agree.

16:50.812 --> 16:53.468
- They're holding position.
- They're not going to charge us,

16:53.593 --> 16:55.969
not if they can hit us
from long range first.

16:56.094 --> 16:59.351
But if we can withstand that weapon,
we'll draw them in.

16:59.655 --> 17:01.068
Prepare to fire!

17:09.365 --> 17:10.996
Good-bye, Jedi.

17:11.722 --> 17:12.530
Fire!

17:15.660 --> 17:16.609
Incoming!

17:18.996 --> 17:20.163
Power the shields!

17:47.180 --> 17:50.568
Now they'll have to get their hands
dirty and meet us face-to-face.

17:50.981 --> 17:53.363
Squad one, prepare to charge.

17:53.812 --> 17:54.989
Prepare to charge.

17:57.417 --> 17:58.267
Charge!

18:02.164 --> 18:03.914
That's a lot of clankers.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.459
We got to stop them
before they get through that shield.

18:34.192 --> 18:35.638
Five, four,

18:36.349 --> 18:37.149
three,

18:37.417 --> 18:38.217
two,

18:38.657 --> 18:39.457
one,

18:40.300 --> 18:41.100
zero.

18:41.468 --> 18:44.038
Sir, the first squad
has been destroyed.

18:45.485 --> 18:47.584
Squad two and three, attack!

18:48.372 --> 18:51.587
- That wasn't so tough.
- That was just the first wave.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.513
Snips, get back to the village!

19:00.901 --> 19:02.766
I'll take care of the new weapon.

19:07.029 --> 19:08.772
That's it. We have to retreat!

19:13.441 --> 19:15.991
Take cover.
They've breached the shield!

19:22.245 --> 19:24.103
They're taking out
the shield generators.

19:24.228 --> 19:25.455
We have to do something.

19:39.938 --> 19:42.806
Their shield is down.
Launch another shell.

19:51.687 --> 19:54.109
Sir, there's a Jedi
heading right for us.

19:54.748 --> 19:56.945
Then blast him, you idiot!

20:03.911 --> 20:04.994
No survivors.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.541
Wag Too, what are you doing?

20:10.822 --> 20:13.211
- We're going to help.
- I forbid this.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.069
What more would you have them do

20:15.194 --> 20:17.215
before we are allowed
to defend ourselves?

20:17.614 --> 20:19.259
- But...
- We have to do this.

20:41.461 --> 20:42.263
Help!

20:42.609 --> 20:44.186
I'll be defoliated!

20:54.557 --> 20:56.772
There goes my promotion.

20:58.221 --> 21:00.425
The weapon has been disabled.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.176
Copy that, General.

21:31.092 --> 21:33.342
- Thank you, Wag Too.
- Thank you.

21:33.503 --> 21:35.758
Our village would certainly
have been destroyed

21:35.883 --> 21:37.921
without your protection.
Father,

21:38.089 --> 21:40.264
I was just offering the Jedi
our thanks.

21:40.389 --> 21:42.339
Perhaps we do owe you thanks,

21:42.928 --> 21:44.378
but I still wonder,

21:44.940 --> 21:46.550
at what cost?

21:58.312 --> 22:00.312
<i>Why am I always the lucky one?</i>

22:00.986 --> 22:04.050
<i>As if freezing our behinds off
on this rock weren't bad enough.</i>

22:04.656 --> 22:05.616
<i>What was that?</i>

22:05.741 --> 22:08.641
<i>Anakin and I have a full scale war
on our hands</i>

22:08.869 --> 22:11.454
<i>since chairman Cho refuses
to be reasonnable.</i>

22:11.622 --> 22:13.373
They are savages.
Trespassers!

22:13.717 --> 22:16.209
<i>We must broker a peace
between the Pantaurens</i>

22:16.377 --> 22:18.781
<i>and the creatures
who call this place home.</i>

22:18.906 --> 22:20.630
<i>Easier said than done.</i>

22:21.305 --> 22:27.466
