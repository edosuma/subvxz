Previously onMacGyver...JILL: Hello?

00:03.481 --> 00:04.961
Jill

00:05.005 --> 00:07.746
I just got a phone
delivered with your number.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.052
Where are you?

00:09.096 --> 00:11.489
Heard you've been
looking for me.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.274
Jill?

00:13.317 --> 00:14.449
MURDOC :
I'm sorry.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.581
Jill is unavailable right now.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.193
Can I just say how good it is
to hear your voice?

00:19.236 --> 00:23.110
I really do hope we can see each
other before you leave again.

00:29.812 --> 00:35.165
♪ What you leave behind

00:35.209 --> 00:38.864
♪ Never leaves you

00:38.908 --> 00:41.476

00:41.519 --> 00:43.913
MacGYVER:
Matty?

00:45.436 --> 00:47.612
I should have protected her.

00:49.005 --> 00:53.488
There's nothing
you could've done.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.142
I know.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.840
And that's what hurts the most.

00:59.798 --> 01:02.105
♪ All that you carry

01:02.149 --> 01:04.803
♪ Carries you...

01:04.847 --> 01:08.372
I brought Jill into the Phoenix.

01:08.416 --> 01:12.376
I recruited her
straight out of college.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.118
You know, she turned me down
for this job?

01:15.162 --> 01:16.598
Twice.

01:16.641 --> 01:20.515
But I convinced her
that her place was here.

01:20.558 --> 01:23.866
Because I saw something
so special in her.

01:23.909 --> 01:26.999
I saw such a bright
future for her.

01:27.043 --> 01:31.439
And now Murdoc has taken
all of that away.

01:31.482 --> 01:34.703
Jill was like a
daughter to me.

01:34.746 --> 01:38.663
She was one of the most
idealistic and determined people

01:38.707 --> 01:40.100
I had ever known.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.712
I'd like to say something
at her funeral,

01:43.755 --> 01:49.196
I just... I don't know what.

01:49.239 --> 01:51.546

MATTY:
Mac?

02:38.245 --> 02:40.769
I want to find him.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.945
We want the same
thing, Mac,

02:42.988 --> 02:44.903
but there's
no predicting Murdoc.

02:44.947 --> 02:47.602
He could be anywhere
in the world by now.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.780
Tell Oversight
I'll rejoin the Phoenix,

02:51.823 --> 02:53.956
on one condition:

02:53.999 --> 02:57.960
I want access to every resource
this agency has.

02:58.003 --> 03:00.310
I'm gonna use them
to hunt down Murdoc.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.148
MAN:
South of the border.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.673
I'm still not in hell.

03:16.805 --> 03:19.024
I'll be damned. Ryan Thorpe.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.287
In the flesh.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.984
Ooh, been too
long, baby.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.464
Ten years.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.074
Yeah, well, you look great.
I-I like the new wheels.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.771
Thanks.
Yeah.

03:26.815 --> 03:28.512
You okay?

03:28.556 --> 03:32.516
Oh. Not really.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.822
But it's nothing

03:33.865 --> 03:35.040
we can't talk about

03:35.084 --> 03:36.172
over a couple beers. Come on.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.000
The beers will have
to wait, Jack.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.262
I need your help.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.090
Caleb Worthy's in trouble.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.266
WORTHY:
My picture's everywhere.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.269
I had to flee the city
into the hills.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.924
I'm sending my coordinates
with this video.

03:48.967 --> 03:52.710
If any of you guys
are listening... Jungle Book.

03:52.754 --> 03:56.148
Worthy sent me that video
42 minutes ago.

03:56.192 --> 03:58.673
Sent it my old e-mail,
the one from Delta days.

03:58.716 --> 04:01.284
Soon as I saw it, I got in
the car, came right to you.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.330
How in the hell did
Worthy go get himself

04:03.373 --> 04:04.679
in this kind of trouble?

04:04.722 --> 04:06.985
He was on a contracting job
down in Honduras.

04:07.029 --> 04:08.552
Apparently, a group
of insurgents had been

04:08.596 --> 04:10.075
bombing railroad depots,

04:10.119 --> 04:11.642
and the crew Worthy
hooked up with was hired

04:11.686 --> 04:12.817
to protect the tracks.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.080
Only, Worthy was caught on video

04:15.124 --> 04:17.866
setting up an IED
seconds before it went off.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.868
No, t-that's got to be
some kind of mistake.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.870
W-Worthy's no terrorist.
The kid's a war hero.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.915
Yeah. Well, we know that,

04:23.959 --> 04:26.048
but the Honduran government
does not.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.224
They've ordered him
shot on sight.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.706
Jungle Book, huh? Those are two
words I never wanted to hear.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.273
That's a call to action,
right there.

04:33.316 --> 04:34.404
No kidding.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.537
If he's bringing up
our old oath,

04:36.580 --> 04:38.365
that means he thinks
he's not coming back home.

04:38.408 --> 04:40.105
Oh, he's coming home.

04:40.149 --> 04:42.847
Hey, listen, Ryan,
I am so sorry

04:42.891 --> 04:45.372
I haven't been to see you
since we all got back...

04:45.415 --> 04:46.764
I could've picked up
a phone, too.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.290
After everything
we all went through...

04:51.943 --> 04:53.597
...who needs the memories?

04:54.946 --> 04:57.471
So can't the State Department
or the DoD

04:57.514 --> 04:59.342
help us out with this one?No.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.126
He wasn't working with
the U.S. government on this one,

05:01.170 --> 05:03.041
so they're not gonna
be any help at all.

05:03.085 --> 05:05.174
And now that he's been labeled a
terrorist, the State Department

05:05.217 --> 05:07.524
won't touch him.
Jack.

05:07.568 --> 05:11.311
Worthy's only hope
of surviving this is you.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.103
Not sure what's more unsettling,

05:21.146 --> 05:22.844
us being late
to a meeting Matty called,

05:22.887 --> 05:25.237
or Matty being late
to a meeting Matty called.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.327
I'm not late, Bozer.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.024
I've been waiting for you guys.

05:29.067 --> 05:29.938
LEANNA: Matty,
what are you doing

05:29.981 --> 05:31.287
in D.C.?Does this have to do

05:31.331 --> 05:32.332
with finding Murdoc?

05:32.375 --> 05:33.724
I wish.
Had a meeting on the Hill.

05:33.768 --> 05:34.812
The in-person kind, apparently.

05:34.856 --> 05:35.900
MATTY:
That's correct, Riley.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.511
And before you start digging

05:37.554 --> 05:39.643
for more info,
that's all I can say.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.428
So swallow
your questions, Bozer,

05:41.471 --> 05:42.994
and let me explain
why you're here.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.519
I'm taking
the training wheels off.

05:45.562 --> 05:48.913
It's time to let the Teen Titans
loose on their own op.

05:51.307 --> 05:52.743
I'm Raven.

05:52.787 --> 05:53.918
Starfire.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.140
Beast Boy.
Beast Boy.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.621
Okay, you two

06:00.664 --> 06:02.536
got this psychic connection
thing going.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.538
It's really creepy,

06:04.581 --> 06:07.323
and I don't watch Teen Titans
'cause I don't watch cartoons.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.542
Really?

06:08.585 --> 06:10.935
Wait, is being Beast Boy bad?

06:10.979 --> 06:13.547
MATTY:
Not bad, Bozer, just annoying.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.723
Which is actually perfect,
because right now,

06:15.766 --> 06:17.333
you're really annoying me.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.987
So if you don't mind,

06:19.030 --> 06:20.205
I'd like to get
this briefing started.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.424
I don't, if, uh,

06:21.468 --> 06:23.165
Maven and Firestarter
don't mind.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.036
Raven and Starfire.Raven and Starfire.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.212
Oh, whatever.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.649
Matty,

06:28.692 --> 06:29.954
you were saying?

06:29.998 --> 06:31.478
Meet Terry Penn.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.958
Known in the underworld
as a "connector."

06:34.002 --> 06:35.569
Let's say you're a terrorist

06:35.612 --> 06:39.573
from the East Turkestan
Liberation Organization in China

06:39.616 --> 06:42.227
and you want to reach out
to the Italian Mafia

06:42.271 --> 06:44.969
to hide one of your guys
in Paterson, New Jersey.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.581
How would you do that?
You'd contact Penn.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.844
So he's like a scumbag LinkedIn?

06:49.887 --> 06:51.149
MATTY:
Exactly.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.064
Phoenix just intercepted
chatter that Penn

06:53.108 --> 06:55.632
is gonna be in L.A. later today
for a meeting.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.895
But something
must have spooked him,

06:57.939 --> 07:00.507
because he just cashed out
a bunch of offshore accounts,

07:00.550 --> 07:03.205
and chartered a plane
to get him out of the country

07:03.248 --> 07:05.512
just three hours
after he arrives.

07:05.555 --> 07:09.037
My guess is he's about
to go off the grid for good.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.647
Which leads me
to your assignment:

07:10.691 --> 07:13.389
with all the people that Penn
knows, his cell phone

07:13.433 --> 07:15.957
is a veritable who's who
of the underworld.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.263
Huge get for law enforcement.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.961
And you want to be the one
doing the getting.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.397
So...

07:21.441 --> 07:22.616
what's the play?

07:22.659 --> 07:24.444
We put Riley in position
and she hacks it?

07:24.487 --> 07:26.010
I hope that isn't
your plan, Matty.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.709
His phone's got no USB
or headphone jack.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.711
It runs a propriety O.S.,

07:30.754 --> 07:32.843
it's got end-to-end encryption
built into all apps.

07:32.887 --> 07:35.890
It'd be almost impossible
to get behind, even for me.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.892
MATTY: Which is why you're not
gonna hack it.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.371
You're gonna steal it.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.721
Nice.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.723
A little grand theft cell phone.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.289
So where's this heist
going down?

07:44.333 --> 07:45.508
In his fancy hotel room?

07:45.552 --> 07:46.814
Or are we hitting him
in transit?

07:46.857 --> 07:48.380
Neither, Beast Boy.

07:48.424 --> 07:51.296
You guys are gonna
intercept Penn here.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.779
Whoa, that...
that's the Sparkman house.

07:55.823 --> 07:56.737
The who

07:56.780 --> 07:57.999
The Sparkman house.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.653
Sparkman's this crooked
Internet mogul

07:59.696 --> 08:01.393
who made a fortune
mining Bitcoin.

08:01.437 --> 08:02.699
His place in the
Hollywood Hills

08:02.743 --> 08:04.484
is the place
for the hottest parties.

08:04.527 --> 08:07.269
MATTY: Hot parties that a lot
of shady people attend.

08:07.312 --> 08:10.490
Riley, Leanna, you're to go
to the party as guests,

08:10.533 --> 08:13.101
get close to Penn, shadow him

08:13.144 --> 08:15.364
and then look for an opportunity
to steal his phone.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.452
And what am I doing?

08:16.496 --> 08:17.540
You're gonna outfit

08:17.584 --> 08:18.802
Riley and Leanna for the op,

08:18.846 --> 08:20.064
and then you're gonna help

08:20.108 --> 08:21.544
run the war room. And remember:

08:21.588 --> 08:23.720
this might be one of the hottest
parties in town,

08:23.764 --> 08:25.722
but it's also one
of the most dangerous.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.550
With Penn in attendance,
that means

08:27.594 --> 08:30.814
a lot of very violent men
and women will be there as well.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.121
So be ready.

08:38.430 --> 08:40.607
Thanks for calling
me back, Steve.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.999
Jack, it's Mac.

08:42.043 --> 08:44.567
Who's Steve?Oh, hey. Hey, Mac.

08:44.611 --> 08:48.223
Uh, Steve is
my financial advisor.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.225
We're just doing the biannual

08:50.268 --> 08:51.966
check-in on the state
of my 401K.

08:52.009 --> 08:55.752
Dude, you spend every dollar
you make almost in real time.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.580
I got to go, Mac. I'm sorry.What's actually going on?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.408
Money never sleeps, dude.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.716
Stevie, did you got my message?

09:02.759 --> 09:05.414
Yeah, yeah. Just increase
the credit line

09:05.457 --> 09:08.199
on all my cards, okay?
Max them out, ASAP.

09:08.243 --> 09:11.725
Uh-- don't ask, just do it.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.344
What's up

09:22.387 --> 09:24.738
Whoa!

09:24.781 --> 09:27.349
Don't ever
do that again, man.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.656
Oh, you almost gave me
a heart attack. Huh?

09:29.699 --> 09:31.396
Popping out of thin air
like that?

09:31.440 --> 09:33.268
That was some Matty-level
Houdini stuff right there.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.965
It was, it was
kind of nice.

09:35.009 --> 09:38.665
Wait a minute.
She isn't here, too, is she?

09:38.708 --> 09:40.449
Matty?
No. It's just me.

09:40.492 --> 09:41.537
Oh. Okay, good.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.538
Look, after our phone call,

09:42.582 --> 09:43.757
I got a little concerned,

09:43.800 --> 09:45.323
and after tracing your phone
didn't work,

09:45.367 --> 09:47.630
I called Riley, asked for
a favor, she looked into "Steve

09:47.674 --> 09:48.718
the financial guy."Uh-huh.

09:48.762 --> 09:49.850
You drained your bank accounts,

09:49.893 --> 09:51.025
you maxed out
all your credit cards.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.853
You're lying to
borrow the Phoenix jet.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.855
What is going on?
Nothing.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.247
Why can't you look me in the eye
and tell me that?

09:56.291 --> 09:58.293
A friend of mine's in trouble.
Okay, Mac?

09:58.336 --> 10:01.775
Okay? A man
who saved my life

10:01.818 --> 10:04.255
is about to lose his, okay?

10:04.299 --> 10:07.694
Yeah, okay, well,
you could've told me that.

10:07.737 --> 10:11.001
Yeah, I could've, but I don't
know where you stand, man.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.438
What is that supposed to mean?

10:13.482 --> 10:16.572
It means you left, then you're
back. Then you left, again.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.009
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're right.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.576
But I'm here now.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.187
In fact, that's why I was
calling you earlier.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.407
I asked Matty to reinstate me.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.887
Really?

10:26.930 --> 10:28.192
Yeah.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.846
What happened to you
going back back

10:29.890 --> 10:32.719
to Nigeria and Nasha and...

10:32.762 --> 10:34.590
Yeah, I know. Nasha and I
are gonna figure out

10:34.634 --> 10:37.245
the long distance thing
for a while, but I'm back,

10:37.288 --> 10:39.639
so anything you're doing,
I'm going with you.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.205
We'll ask Matty for help.

10:41.249 --> 10:42.903
Nah, nah, she can't do anything.Hey, man,

10:42.946 --> 10:44.774
if your buddy's in trouble, I'm
sure she'd be willing to help.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.820
She can't help.And why not?

10:46.863 --> 10:51.346
Because the U.S. government
cut Worthy loose.

10:51.389 --> 10:54.218
Wait a second, Worthy,
from your old Delta unit?

10:54.262 --> 10:56.656
Yeah, and no one's gonna
stick their neck out for him.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.005
No one but me.

10:58.048 --> 11:01.312
An-And hopefully
my old Delta team.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.053
That's why I need
the resources, so...

11:03.097 --> 11:05.665
I got to bounce, dude.
I got some recruiting to do.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.188
You mean wegot some
recruiting to do.
Now, Mac--

11:07.231 --> 11:08.711
Hey, look, if Worthy's
your family,

11:08.755 --> 11:09.799
then he's my family, too.

11:09.843 --> 11:10.844
If you've ever
taught me anything,

11:10.887 --> 11:12.846
it's that family is everything.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.412
I didn't even think
you were listening.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.806
Let's go get 'em.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.992
JACK:
Okay, kid, I'm almost in.

11:30.733 --> 11:31.647
WORTHY :
Roger, Jack.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.605
Bravo 2, this is Bravo Lead.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.085
Confirm assault team
in position.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.830
Roger, Bravo Lead.
Bravo Team in position.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.005
JACK:
All right, gents,

11:42.049 --> 11:43.615
let's party.
And remember,

11:43.659 --> 11:46.009
flashes only, please,
no frags.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.751
I don't want my bits and pieces
becoming, you know...

11:48.795 --> 11:50.057
bits and pieces.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.059
As soon as you confirm
the hostage location,

11:52.102 --> 11:53.843
we'll join the party.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.540
Worthy, you just keep
watching our backs.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.719
Hola.

12:03.418 --> 12:06.203
Mi nombre esJack.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.686
Who the hell are you?!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.035
My close friends call me
six in the center,

12:12.079 --> 12:14.516
up against the post.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.083
It's a family name.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.143
Okay, boys, grab the hostages.
Let's get out of here.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.928
Bad news, bad news!
Hey, hey.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.234
These guys got friends.
A lot of friends.

12:54.338 --> 12:59.343
Okay, so, did y'all
find anything out about Worthy?

12:59.387 --> 13:00.910
RILEY :
We did.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.651
We have security footage
of Worthy near

13:02.694 --> 13:04.958
a Honduran train station right
before the bombs exploded.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.611
The video quality's
not great, but

13:06.655 --> 13:08.788
unfortunately,
what's on it's even worse.

13:20.190 --> 13:23.063
No. No way.

13:23.106 --> 13:26.066
Worthy would not do
something like that, trust me.

13:26.109 --> 13:28.024
Okay, then what was he doing
with the device, Jack?

13:28.068 --> 13:29.025
He was probably trying

13:29.069 --> 13:30.940
to disarm the damn thing,
Riley.

13:30.984 --> 13:31.985
Yeah, but there's no way
you can tell that

13:32.028 --> 13:33.073
from the footage, Jack,

13:33.116 --> 13:34.248
the picture quality's garbage.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.597
Can't tell anything
from that footage.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.338
RILEY: And while we're playing
"Stump Jack,"

13:37.381 --> 13:39.601
any idea what he was doing
with this guy?

13:39.644 --> 13:42.473
Let me see.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.562
That's Jacob Lawlor.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.695
He's, uh, well decorated.

13:46.738 --> 13:47.870
Now he's a freelance
contractor.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.351
Does a lot of work
in the area.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.831
Worthy was hired
on Lawlor's crew

13:51.874 --> 13:55.095
to protect the tracks,
not blow 'em up.

13:58.272 --> 13:59.360
Guys, I got to go.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.840
I'll try and clean up
this footage.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.102
Maybe it'll give us
some answers.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.320
JACK:
Yep.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.845
You really think
you're gonna be able

14:05.888 --> 14:07.150
to reassemble your
old Delta unit?

14:07.194 --> 14:08.935
Aren't those guys retired
for a long time now?

14:08.978 --> 14:11.676
Trust me, dude, they're in.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.549
I know it's been ten years
since our last OP in Bogota,

14:14.592 --> 14:15.985
but once they see me,
they'll know what's up.

14:17.769 --> 14:18.727
I think.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.692
All right...

14:27.736 --> 14:29.651
Okay, how's it feel?

14:29.694 --> 14:30.957
Can you move in it?
Mm-hmm.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.915
Yeah, it fits great.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.047
It's comfortable, too.Good.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.700
I lined it with ballistic
mesh fabric,

14:35.744 --> 14:38.225
then adjusted the cut
for maximum maneuverability.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.053
Mm. Sexy and functional.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.532
And I got more.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.883
A little something

14:43.926 --> 14:46.929
from my nine millimeter
spring bag collection.

14:46.973 --> 14:50.193
Oh, yeah, that's
my type of clutch.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.716
Great job, babe.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.370
Ah, thanks. Well, I can't
take all the credit.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.024
Mac designed the
internal mechanism

14:55.068 --> 14:57.200
right before he
left for Nigeria.

14:57.244 --> 14:59.289
Hey, how's the phone
coming, Riley?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.377
Slowly.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.031
A convincing
fake takes time.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.424
When I'm done,
all we'll have to worry about

15:03.467 --> 15:05.774
is getting it close enough
to swap it out.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.907
With Raven and Starfire
in the field

15:07.950 --> 15:09.212
and Batman running
the war room,

15:09.256 --> 15:11.127
what could go wrong?

15:11.171 --> 15:14.522
Wait, are you... are you
saying you're Batman?

15:14.565 --> 15:19.048
I mean, come on. I'm way more
Batman than Beast Boy.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.267
So are you changing your
character name, Bozer?

15:20.310 --> 15:22.660
Such
a Beast Boy move.

15:22.704 --> 15:25.185
You know how psyched I was
when Matty first hired you?

15:25.228 --> 15:27.013
Hella psyched.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.406
But now that I see that
you two have become BFFs,

15:29.450 --> 15:31.191
I'm revising my opinion.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.627
Such a Beast Boy response.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.368
What
Pretty much.

15:34.411 --> 15:37.197
Deacon lives the closest,
so we're, uh,

15:37.240 --> 15:38.807
we're picking him up first.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.156
You used to talk about
Deacon all the time.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.637
He was a...
Toughest SOB
to ever wear the patch.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.117
Man, he's the real deal.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.293
DEACON: Julie, please put
that water pistol down.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.947
I have asked you
and asked you.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.209
Now, come on,
help me out here.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.167
Joel, put your
pants on, man.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.516
Let's go. Let's saddle up.
We got to go.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.170
Come on, come on.
Tie the shoe.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.433
We got to go, please.
Help me out here.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.045
Deacon.Yes?

15:59.088 --> 16:00.394
Dalton?

16:00.437 --> 16:04.006
Hey, hey, not in the face.
Not in...

16:04.050 --> 16:05.268
Julie, you are killing me today.

16:05.312 --> 16:08.097
Are you kidding me, Joel?

16:08.141 --> 16:09.620
Please, please stop that.

16:09.664 --> 16:10.752
How you living, man?

16:12.928 --> 16:15.975
Dalton, I heard a rumor
you're working for the CIA now.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.193
Any truth to that?

16:17.237 --> 16:18.803
Yeah, I left the Agency
awhile back.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.502
I, uh, work
at a think tank now.

16:21.545 --> 16:22.894
Oh, a think tank, huh?
What is he, the tank part?

16:25.245 --> 16:29.292
Hey, uh... do you keep
in touch with Worthy?

16:29.336 --> 16:32.252
Not as much as
I should have, man.

16:32.295 --> 16:35.690
Any idea why he'd take up
this contracting work?

16:35.733 --> 16:37.126
Yep. Money.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.389
His kid needed surgery,

16:39.433 --> 16:40.564
It was expensive.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.001
Oh, man, you should've
called me, bro.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.045
I would've helped.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.307
I know. I know
you would've, Jack.

16:44.351 --> 16:47.310
Anyway, surgery went well,
kid healed quick,

16:47.354 --> 16:48.659
but it depleted his bankroll.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.792
So he took the
job in Honduras?
Yup.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.446
Said he was gonna refill
his bank account.

16:52.489 --> 16:53.795
It'd be quick.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.580
And then he was gonna hang up
his spurs for good,

16:56.624 --> 16:58.800
but it's not the way
it went down.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.758
That's why we're here, man.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.238
We're going to get him

17:02.282 --> 17:03.761
and you're coming
with us. Let's go.

17:18.559 --> 17:19.908
So, you see, Judy,

17:19.951 --> 17:22.519
I thought it would
really be fun

17:22.563 --> 17:24.086
to get the guys together

17:24.130 --> 17:26.567
for a little, uh...Fishing trip.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.699
...fishing trip. That's right.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.092
No big deal,

17:30.136 --> 17:32.442
just some typical
male-bonding stuff.

17:32.486 --> 17:36.316
Okay. I'll be back
soon, darling.

17:36.359 --> 17:37.969
Hunting trip will
only be a few days.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.711
Hunting. I thought
it was fishing.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.236
It's both. It's one of those
package vacation deals.

17:46.978 --> 17:48.197
Judy still hates you.

17:48.241 --> 17:51.200
Ah, she's about as warm
as a stepmother's kiss.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.072
You know, I thought
after ten years

17:53.115 --> 17:55.248
she'd be over the whole
Jell-O incident, man.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.598
No.
The what?

17:57.641 --> 17:59.513
Yeah, our last harmony retreat,
there was some...

18:00.775 --> 18:02.690
...Jell-O involved.

18:02.733 --> 18:07.390
Okay. So next stop is
your demo guy, Fitzy Sheng.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.218
I wonder what Fitzy's
been up to.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.959
Oh, I don't know,
but whatever it is,

18:11.002 --> 18:13.744
I'm sure it involves
really big explosions.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.094
Really?
Yeah.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.182
We're gonna get along.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.550
It took me over a week
to build that bridge.

18:36.593 --> 18:39.466
Poof. Gone in two seconds.

18:39.509 --> 18:42.425
Life, huh?

18:42.469 --> 18:44.123
Choo-choo train philosophy
fits you. I love it.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.342
But now that
we've seen that

18:46.386 --> 18:49.389
and acted interested,

18:49.432 --> 18:51.173
you in?

18:51.217 --> 18:54.089
I promised Rachel
that this was gonna be

18:54.133 --> 18:56.135
the biggest explosion
I made once I was out.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.137
But if Worthy's in trouble,

18:58.180 --> 18:59.442
I know she'll understand.

19:00.530 --> 19:01.792
I'm in.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.011
MacGYVER:
All right, then.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.143
One more.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.970
Yeah, time to get the big boy.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.408
...which is why we're here, Sid.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.975
We need your help
bringing him home.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.760
You in, big boy?

19:12.803 --> 19:14.283
Hey, hey, hey.

19:14.327 --> 19:15.415
Hey, sweetheart.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.113
Let's move it.
I got a thing.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.467
I'm in.

19:24.511 --> 19:25.642
Let's go.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.688
♪

19:32.519 --> 19:34.869
I got to say,
I'm amazed.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.132
Every one of these guys put
their life on pause immediately

19:37.176 --> 19:38.438
to go save Worthy.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.135
JACK: Yeah, well,
Worthy's the only reason

19:40.179 --> 19:42.485
these guys have
a life to pause.

19:43.660 --> 19:44.966
Come on, come on!

19:47.490 --> 19:50.189
JACK: Thorpe,
where you hit?
My back.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.845
Let's go.I can't feel my legs.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.847
Go, go, go!I can't feel my legs.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.030
Fire in the hole!

20:13.386 --> 20:15.518
South of the border...

20:15.562 --> 20:17.041
...still not in hell.

20:19.130 --> 20:22.264
Worthy. You're an animal.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.831
Just get me home, Jack.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.398
You just got us
all home, brother.

20:28.444 --> 20:31.099
You just got us all home.

20:38.672 --> 20:41.109
Oh, my back.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.940
FITZY: My shoulders
are killing me.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.071
You must be Lawlor.

20:47.115 --> 20:48.812
Nice to meet you.
This is Mac.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.337
Hey. I'm glad
you called, Dalton.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.816
Could use
the extra manpower.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.819
Honduran police have upped
their efforts to find Worthy.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.821
Yeah, has he, uh,
reached out to you guys?
No.

20:57.865 --> 21:00.389
All right, come
meet my fellas.

21:00.433 --> 21:01.999
Hey, Riles.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.437
We just landed in Honduras,
meeting Worthy's old crew now.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.743
RILEY:
Mac, don't give them any intel.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.310
What

21:08.354 --> 21:09.703
I wrote an image-processing
algorithm

21:09.746 --> 21:12.401
to clean up some of the
artifacts on the footage.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.098
Part of it's been erased.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.449
Good news, Caleb Worthy
didn't blow up the tracks.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.189
Lawlor and his men did.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.756
BOZER:
We checked Lawlor's accounts.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.236
Looks like he was taking
payments from the government

21:21.280 --> 21:23.325
and the insurgents.He was double-dipping,

21:23.369 --> 21:25.588
taking money to protect
the tracks and blow them up.

21:25.632 --> 21:26.981
Real great guy, that one.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.591
Worthy must've figured out
what he was doing

21:28.635 --> 21:30.550
and tried to stop him,
which means that

21:30.593 --> 21:33.379
Lawlor doesn't want to save
Worthy, he wants to silence him.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.772
Hey. We're rolling out.
Jack says you need a ride.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.948
Yup.Mac, we good?

21:37.992 --> 21:39.123
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.212
We got a problem?

21:41.256 --> 21:43.954
No, just some logistics.
Let's get out of here.

21:43.998 --> 21:45.434
All right.

21:45.478 --> 21:46.609
All right,
we're in this one.

21:46.653 --> 21:48.176
Line up, boys,
let's go.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.364
DEACON: I mean,
I didn't know what to say.

22:02.408 --> 22:05.411
Dalton, crazy SOB, looks up,

22:05.454 --> 22:06.455
says to the shepherd,

22:06.499 --> 22:08.588
"How much for
the whole herd?"

22:14.681 --> 22:15.638
Jack,

22:15.682 --> 22:17.988
top five Bruce Willis movies?

22:18.032 --> 22:20.469
Excellent question. You know,
I could break BW's catalogue

22:20.513 --> 22:23.559
into four main periods,
really, I mean, you got your...

22:23.603 --> 22:25.953
Die Hard 2is one of them,
though, right?

22:25.996 --> 22:27.781
It is great,
but I don't know

22:27.824 --> 22:29.783
if it's top five.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.524
But you remember the plot?

22:31.567 --> 22:33.700
Mm-hmm.
See...

22:35.092 --> 22:36.180
Specifically the part

22:36.224 --> 22:37.878
about the soldiers
that Bruce meets?

22:37.921 --> 22:39.183
Who are you?

22:39.227 --> 22:40.446
I know the plot

22:40.489 --> 22:43.623
to every single
Bruce Willis movie ever made.

22:43.666 --> 22:45.015
Who do you think
you're talking to?

22:58.028 --> 23:00.553
I don't think they're
slowing down to let us go pee.

23:02.903 --> 23:05.558
Uh, hey, fellas,
um...

23:08.038 --> 23:10.214
You, uh,
remember Cambodia?

23:12.652 --> 23:15.002
DEACON:
Come on, Fitzy, hurry.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.221
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

23:28.189 --> 23:32.280
DEACON: How'd you know Die Hard 2,baby!

23:35.370 --> 23:36.502
Man,

23:36.545 --> 23:38.852
I haven't felt this
sore since Kandahar.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.724
What? Munoz, you slept through
damn near half that op.

23:41.768 --> 23:44.031
I wasn't
sleeping, Fitzy,

23:44.074 --> 23:45.989
a frag blew me
headfirst into a wall.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.774
Yeah, I was unconscious.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.253
Call it what
you want.

23:49.297 --> 23:50.516
Yo, how much further
to Worthy?

23:50.559 --> 23:53.344
Yeah, let me check my phone.

23:53.388 --> 23:56.435
Oh, ha, ha, very funny.
Who took my phone?

23:57.436 --> 23:58.872
Oh, you cannot
be serious.

23:58.915 --> 24:01.570
Oh, please tell me
you're kidding.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.705
I must've lost my phone
when we were running

24:05.748 --> 24:07.228
from Lawlor's guys, man.

24:07.271 --> 24:09.448
Oh, we missed
you, Dalton.Stand down.

24:09.491 --> 24:11.232
I ain't...
That phone...

24:11.275 --> 24:13.582
BOTH:
Had Worthy's location on it.

24:13.626 --> 24:16.411
All right, we need
transport, fast.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.195
How'd I lose my phone?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.941
Okay, I got an idea.
Anyone got their tags on them?

24:29.163 --> 24:30.512
What are you doing?

24:30.556 --> 24:32.471
Bypassing the ignition.

24:34.777 --> 24:36.257
We could've used this
kid back in the day.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.609
All right, Jack,
the eye in the sky says

24:40.653 --> 24:44.091
the road up ahead is clear,
free of hostiles. Over.

24:44.134 --> 24:45.571
JACK :
Copy that, buddy.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.964
Appreciate you having our backs,
that's for sure.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.098
MacGYVER: You know, just because
Lawlor found the phone,

24:51.141 --> 24:52.882
it doesn't mean
he found the video.

24:52.926 --> 24:55.102
No, Lawlor is a pro, man.

24:55.145 --> 24:58.279
I'm telling you,
he found the video. I...

24:58.322 --> 25:00.455
I can't let anything
happen to Worthy.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.200
What is it about Worthy?

25:06.243 --> 25:08.115
I've never really
seen you this...

25:08.158 --> 25:10.857
He saved all of our lives,
for one.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.946
The last time
I saw Worthy,

25:12.989 --> 25:17.080
we had just gotten back
from a tough rotation.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.561
And if anybody knows what
I'm talking about, it's you.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.695
It was a gruesome deployment,
you know what I mean?

25:24.958 --> 25:26.350
Now, I got home
and I couldn't adjust.

25:26.394 --> 25:29.179
I mean, I-I-I couldn't even
leave my house.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.530
You know, my girlfriend
at the time,

25:31.573 --> 25:34.315
she bailed, she couldn't
stand watching me

25:34.358 --> 25:37.231
walk from tip to tail
of that house talking to myself,

25:37.274 --> 25:40.190
crying all the time,
you know, nightmares.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.586
I was in a dark place.
I was in a really,

25:44.630 --> 25:47.850
really dark place,
and I couldn't turn it off.

25:49.852 --> 25:50.984
WORTHY:
What's up, Jack?

25:51.027 --> 25:52.594
Sup, man?

25:52.638 --> 25:54.074
Chillin'.

25:54.117 --> 25:58.426
What's with
the robe, dude?

25:58.469 --> 26:01.951
Getting all, uh,
emotional on me?

26:03.170 --> 26:07.043
No, man, I'm just,
you know, decompressing.

26:07.087 --> 26:09.350
Oh, well, decompressing
seems kind of-- uh-uh--

26:09.393 --> 26:11.613
depressing.
Brought you a pie.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.136
Blueberry peach,

26:13.180 --> 26:15.182
from your favorite
place, man.

26:17.358 --> 26:21.536
So, um... what's up? Come on.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.886
Why you living like
a sullen vampire?

26:23.930 --> 26:27.847
What's going on?Wendy left me, Caleb.

26:27.890 --> 26:31.241
Said she couldn't even stand
being around me.

26:31.285 --> 26:32.155
Hey, hey.

26:32.199 --> 26:34.027
It's her choice, man.Yeah.

26:34.070 --> 26:36.333
You got to respect that.Yeah, okay.

26:36.377 --> 26:37.770
But I'm sorry.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.252
How's your head?

26:44.298 --> 26:46.213
Lots not good.

26:46.256 --> 26:49.869
I've been there.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.789
Hey, look,
I wanted to, um,

26:56.832 --> 27:00.706
I want you to be the first
to know that I am gonna get out.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.664
Wow, you do
something like that,

27:02.708 --> 27:04.448
you have two years
before you make Major.

27:04.492 --> 27:07.364
Yeah, but, see,
um, in two years, uh,

27:07.408 --> 27:09.976
my kid is gonna be, like,
one-and-a-half,

27:10.019 --> 27:11.499
so...
Your kid?

27:12.761 --> 27:15.068
Olivia's pregnant.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.417
Come here.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.853
Congratulations.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.507
I'm so happy for you.

27:19.550 --> 27:21.901
There's gonna be, like, a little
one of me running around

27:21.944 --> 27:23.859
in a couple months, dude.Oh, you sure the world's
ready for that?

27:23.903 --> 27:27.210
BOTH:
We gonna find out.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.256
It's just, um...

27:30.779 --> 27:32.259
The whole kid
thing, it, um,

27:32.302 --> 27:35.828
it gets you thinking, you know,
it just...

27:35.871 --> 27:38.700
I mean, that grenade in Bogotá,

27:38.744 --> 27:42.008
couple inches
left or right and...

27:42.051 --> 27:43.836
I never even found out
that my girl's pregnant.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.838
I don't want Olivia
telling our son stories

27:45.881 --> 27:47.361
about a dad
he never met.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.668
I get it.

27:49.711 --> 27:53.715
For now, I need you
to concentrate on yourself.

27:53.759 --> 27:54.977
Okay?

27:55.021 --> 27:59.678
Each day is like
a little mission, okay?

27:59.721 --> 28:01.810
Now you string enough of those
little missions together,

28:01.854 --> 28:04.900
that's a life.

28:04.944 --> 28:07.381
You got to keep
making yours count, man.

28:07.424 --> 28:08.904
Okay.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.776
You're the bravest man I know.

28:10.819 --> 28:13.604
Don't waste it,
all right?

28:13.648 --> 28:15.781
JACK: Worthy got me
off the couch that day.

28:15.824 --> 28:19.045
After he left,
I rejoined the CIA.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.569
Uh, one thing leads to another,
next thing you know,

28:21.612 --> 28:23.223
I'm in the sandbox
meeting your scrawny ass.

28:24.746 --> 28:28.532
He really...
he saved my life that day.

28:28.576 --> 28:31.057
Fair enough.

Hi.

28:57.126 --> 28:58.780
I'm Roberta.
I'm Lilian.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.173
Great party, right?

29:00.216 --> 29:02.131
Actually, I'm looking
for somebody.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.306
I'd say you
found someone.

29:03.350 --> 29:04.438
Two someones.

29:04.481 --> 29:05.613
Mm-hmm.

29:05.656 --> 29:06.788
So what do you do?

29:10.923 --> 29:12.794
Okay, the charm offensive
isn't working.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.578
Maybe if you spill something
on his jacket, he'll...

29:15.623 --> 29:17.625
Oh, my God,
you're freezing.

29:17.668 --> 29:19.801
She has the chills.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.108
My audition.
What am I gonna do?

29:22.151 --> 29:23.979
She has this really
big audition tomorrow,

29:24.023 --> 29:25.633
huge, and if
she gets sick,

29:25.676 --> 29:27.678
then...

29:27.722 --> 29:30.681
Hey, do you think maybe
she could borrow your jacket?

29:32.335 --> 29:34.337
Sure.

29:37.514 --> 29:38.472
Here you go.

29:38.515 --> 29:39.647
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.825
So did you say
you were a producer?

29:43.869 --> 29:45.261
You look like a producer.

29:53.269 --> 29:56.882
Well, these are the coordinates
that Worthy sent.

29:56.925 --> 29:59.493
I don't see anybody.

29:59.536 --> 30:02.278
Maybe Lawlor didn't
find Worthy's video.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.804
Okay, that's it, gentlemen,
we're on, let's go!

30:13.899 --> 30:14.943
JACK:
I got eyes on Worthy.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.555
DEACON:
So does Lawlor.

30:18.599 --> 30:19.643
JACK:
You were right, Mac.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.036
Lawlor's playing
both sides.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.388
This ain't good.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.569
Uh, Riley, I think
you got a problem.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.397
What is it, Bozer?You got a four-man team

30:34.441 --> 30:36.312
coming in the back,
and I don't think

30:36.356 --> 30:37.400
they're there for the cocktails.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.141
Listen, we're
government agents.

30:39.185 --> 30:40.490
We know who you are.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.802
Come with us
if you want to live.

30:51.197 --> 30:52.285
Okay, let's party.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.329
Flanking right:

30:53.373 --> 30:54.896
Cerveza, Fitzy, Lanier.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.376
Show them what that
gun can do, big boy.

30:56.419 --> 30:57.377
We'll come down
main street,

30:57.420 --> 30:58.421
clean it up
and save Worthy.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.032
Hooah.ALL: Hooah.

31:00.075 --> 31:02.556
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

31:02.599 --> 31:03.557
Kid's got an idea.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.515
We are going to bring the noise.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.909
I knew I liked this kid.Yeah, just don't bust
your phone out around him.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.389
See what I mean?

31:13.697 --> 31:15.308
MUNOZ: You ever put something
back together

31:15.351 --> 31:16.918
the way it was before
you broke it?

31:16.962 --> 31:18.137
Where's the fun in that?

31:18.180 --> 31:20.052
All right, everyone,
take some of these.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.445
Put them in your ears.

31:22.489 --> 31:24.839
You will need them.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.321
How-how...Just put them in there,
put them in there.

31:39.767 --> 31:40.855
Ah!

31:52.171 --> 31:56.305
Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!

31:56.349 --> 31:58.046
Hey, Worthy.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.440
Jack. Jack, what the hell
is that sound?

32:00.483 --> 32:02.485
That's the sound of salvation.

32:07.664 --> 32:08.927
LANIER: It's a clean shot,
through and through.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.406
He'll be fine.

32:11.364 --> 32:12.800
Hell of
a reunion, fellas.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.802
Save that for American soil.
Let's get out of here.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.325
WORTHY:
All right, let's go.

32:16.369 --> 32:17.892
Go, go, go.Go, go, go.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.329
JACK :
Okay, Thorpe, we got Worthy.

32:20.373 --> 32:21.809
We're on the move,
but we're taking fire.

32:21.852 --> 32:23.376
We need cover, fast.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.030
Go west, young man.

32:25.073 --> 32:27.249
Three klicks, I'm looking
at some kind of structure there.

32:27.293 --> 32:28.424
Copy that. You're the man.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.822
RILEY:
Okay, I got to ask.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.824
Why do your friends back there
want you dead?

32:36.867 --> 32:37.999
PENN: So I put
a mafia don in contact

32:38.043 --> 32:39.435
with a lady friend who I thought

32:39.479 --> 32:41.350
moved stolen jewelry,
but turned out to be

32:41.394 --> 32:43.048
an undercover FBI agent.

32:43.091 --> 32:44.919
And now the don is on trial,

32:44.963 --> 32:47.704
and blaming me for
the whole mess. So to thank me,

32:47.748 --> 32:49.184
he greenlit me.If you're marked
for death,

32:49.228 --> 32:50.664
why show your face at a party?

32:50.707 --> 32:52.405
'Cause a person
who RSVP'd yes

32:52.448 --> 32:54.973
to that party owes me
almost 100K.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.410
Money I really needed
to drop off the grid

32:57.453 --> 32:59.020
and stay off.Well, look,

32:59.064 --> 33:00.413
you hand over
that phone of yours

33:00.456 --> 33:01.936
and we'll make sure
you live through this.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.764
I can't give you my phone.

33:03.807 --> 33:06.375
The only thing you got
that we want is that phone.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.290
So give it up
or get the hell out the car.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.292
Leanna, slow down.PENN: No, wait.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.033
What are you doing?

33:13.643 --> 33:15.602
They'll kill me.

33:16.777 --> 33:19.562
Fine. Fine, take it.

33:19.606 --> 33:22.130
It's no good to me
anyway if I'm dead.

33:23.262 --> 33:24.654
BOZER :
Riley, Leanna,

33:24.698 --> 33:27.266
you're insane--
brilliant, but insane.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.137
All right, now,
follow my directions

33:29.181 --> 33:32.053
and I'll get you to safety.
Take your next left, now.

33:40.670 --> 33:43.369
This must be the place
Thorpe was talking about.

33:50.593 --> 33:53.335
I guess this is where Dalton's
Heroes make their last stand.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.263
BOZER : Okay,
Leanna, you're doing great.

34:08.307 --> 34:09.264
Now take your next left

34:09.308 --> 34:10.700
and then an immediate right.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.494
PENN: Ladies, what the hell
have you done?

34:21.537 --> 34:23.148
RILEY:
That's a good question.

34:24.497 --> 34:25.976
Bozer?

34:26.020 --> 34:29.110
Trust me, Riley. I got this.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.895
We trust you, Boze. But
whatever you're planning,
you need to do it now.

34:37.336 --> 34:39.120
Get out, Penn.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.817
Now!

34:49.435 --> 34:51.437
LEANNA: Well played, Bozer.Ha, ha.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.091
Yes.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.138
Not enough.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.314
It never is, big boy,
never is.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.229
Okay, so what's the plan?

35:01.273 --> 35:03.797
Fitzy, you got
any det cord left?

35:03.840 --> 35:05.451
Uh, yeah, uh, less than 20 feet.

35:05.494 --> 35:06.843
That's not a lot,
but we can make it work.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.018
FITZY: Make it
work for what?

35:08.062 --> 35:10.020
Bangalore Torpedoes.

35:10.064 --> 35:11.631
You want to help me build some?

35:11.674 --> 35:13.111
Hell yeah.

35:34.523 --> 35:36.482
You know what
this reminds me of.

35:36.525 --> 35:38.092
Cairo.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.833
Cairo?Yeah, Cairo
for me and Mac

35:39.876 --> 35:42.314
was like, uh, Djibouti

35:42.357 --> 35:43.793
for all of us, you know,
the grim reaper

35:43.837 --> 35:45.795
was in the neighborhood,
he just had the wrong address?

35:47.971 --> 35:50.235
South of the border...

35:50.278 --> 35:51.627
ALL:
...still not in hell.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.063
That's right, still not in hell.

35:54.674 --> 35:57.024
Guys, I want to thank you.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.896
All of you.
I'm sorry I got you into this.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.289
No. I'm sorry.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.812
I should've told you to stick it

36:02.856 --> 36:04.597
when you refused money
for your son's surgery.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.555
JACK:
Hey, hey.

36:06.599 --> 36:08.122
None of us are ever alone
as long as we don't

36:08.166 --> 36:09.341
turn our backs on each other.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.081
Right.That's right.

36:12.735 --> 36:15.695
Look, uh, you guys have been
through a lot together,

36:15.738 --> 36:18.524
and I know I'm not exactly
part of the team,

36:18.567 --> 36:21.396
but what do you say
we show these guys

36:21.440 --> 36:22.745
we're not going down
without a fight?

36:22.789 --> 36:25.400
ALL:
Hooah!

36:28.142 --> 36:30.623
They're here.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.413
Fitzy

36:43.723 --> 36:45.812
All right, boys.
Fire in the hole.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.751
That's it, I'm out.

37:14.057 --> 37:15.407
I'm out.

37:15.450 --> 37:18.366
I'm out, too.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.591
LAWLOR:
We have them surrounded.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.593
Okay.
LAWLOR:
Move in.

37:27.636 --> 37:29.072
This is it, boys.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.553
Blood makes the grass grow.

37:38.430 --> 37:39.953
Let's go!

37:50.877 --> 37:52.922
Get to the trees!

38:01.540 --> 38:02.976
MacGYVER:
That's got to be Matty.

38:03.019 --> 38:04.804
Nobody's got better timing.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.633
JACK: Well, sure it is.
She wants to make sure

38:07.676 --> 38:09.374
we survive this
so she can chew us out.

38:17.469 --> 38:19.471
BOZER: Hey, turn up.

38:19.514 --> 38:21.168
So, look.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.648
I've given it
some thought,

38:22.691 --> 38:26.782
and if you want me
to be Beast Boy,

38:26.826 --> 38:28.175
I'll be Beast Boy.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.482
Well, actually,

38:30.525 --> 38:32.005
we've given it some thought,
too.
Mm-hmm.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.616
And it's cool if you want
to change your name.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.879
So I can be Batman?RILEY: We were
thinking

38:36.923 --> 38:38.316
more like Robin.

38:39.012 --> 38:40.056
Robin

38:40.100 --> 38:41.057
Yeah. Robin.Mm-hmm.

38:41.101 --> 38:42.407
Oh, since we're changing names.

38:42.450 --> 38:45.584
Leanna, coin flip
for Wonder Woman?Nah.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.890
No, you can be Wonder Woman.

38:47.934 --> 38:49.457
I'd rather be Catwoman, anyway.

38:49.501 --> 38:51.981
Catwoman.
Oh, Catwoman!
Okay.

38:52.025 --> 38:54.506
Can we go back to why I can't
be Batman? I want to be Batman.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.029
: I am the Batman.
Look at the voice.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.160
No, don't do that.

38:57.204 --> 38:58.379
RILEY: That's why
you can't be Batman...

38:59.598 --> 39:00.729
MacGYVER: Hey, who
wants some good news?

39:00.773 --> 39:02.818
Yeah.

39:02.862 --> 39:05.081
I just got word that
the Honduran government

39:05.125 --> 39:07.257
has arrested Lawlor and his men.

39:07.301 --> 39:08.607
And they've confessed

39:08.650 --> 39:11.000
to blowing the tracks
and framing Caleb Worthy.

39:12.437 --> 39:13.916
DEACON: Which reminds me,
Worthy. Next time you see

39:13.960 --> 39:16.571
an explosive lying on the
ground, why don't you leave it

39:16.615 --> 39:18.051
to somebody who knows what
the hell he's actually doing?

39:18.094 --> 39:19.487
All right

39:22.360 --> 39:25.928
I want to tell you guys:
I love you.

39:25.972 --> 39:29.018
I'm grateful.
You dropped everything

39:29.062 --> 39:31.586
to pull my butt out of the fire.

39:31.630 --> 39:32.761
I'll never forget it.

39:32.805 --> 39:36.330
And, h-hey, listen.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.593
I know, ten years ago,
we went our separate ways.

39:38.637 --> 39:39.899
That-that happens.

39:39.942 --> 39:43.381
Let's try not
to let that happen again.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.122
Okay? I-It's too good
to see you guys.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.036
Mm-hmm.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.647
Keep each other countable.

39:48.690 --> 39:50.170
Mm-hmm.

39:50.213 --> 39:52.477
Maybe we should also
keep each other accountable.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.695
JACK: Accountable.

39:53.739 --> 39:54.914
Accountable, accounts
receivable.

39:54.957 --> 39:56.437
You get what
I'm saying, man,

39:56.481 --> 39:58.308
just, it's...

39:58.352 --> 40:01.747
I-I think that we should get
together at least twice a year.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.096
Make a commitment.

40:03.139 --> 40:04.445
Right here,
right now.

40:05.707 --> 40:08.580
'Cause this
kind of bond,

40:08.623 --> 40:10.538
it doesn't
grow on trees.

40:10.582 --> 40:11.583
As a matter of fact,
trees ain't...

40:11.626 --> 40:12.714
Dalton, I think
we got your point.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.412
Twice a year, every year.

40:14.455 --> 40:15.978
Yeah, I'll stop there.
All right.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.240
What about the new
member of our group?

40:17.284 --> 40:19.112
Right?
Yeah.

40:19.155 --> 40:21.636
I mean, if you want in.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.072
Mm-hmm.

40:24.073 --> 40:26.075
Uh...

40:26.119 --> 40:27.903
hell yeah.

40:27.947 --> 40:29.078
To Dalton's Heroes.

40:29.122 --> 40:31.080
ALL:
Dalton's Heroes.

40:31.124 --> 40:33.431
Ooh, I like the sound of that.

40:33.474 --> 40:35.258
Yeah.

40:36.999 --> 40:39.437
Hey, hey, Mac.
Y

40:39.480 --> 40:41.134
Well, yeah.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.963
This whole situation
has helped me realize

40:44.006 --> 40:47.793
I shouldn't have waited
ten years to let those guys know

40:47.836 --> 40:49.621
how I felt about them,
and, uh...

40:51.231 --> 40:55.365
...well, I-I just, don't want
to make that same mistake twice.

40:55.409 --> 40:57.019
I-I wanted you to know

40:57.063 --> 40:59.674
I really appreciate
you always being there for me.

40:59.718 --> 41:02.982
You're... a good dude, man. Huh?

41:03.025 --> 41:05.158
Yeah

41:05.201 --> 41:06.551
There you go.

41:06.594 --> 41:07.856
Hey.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.684
Likewise.

41:09.728 --> 41:12.861
And, um, and not returning

41:12.905 --> 41:15.168
your phone calls, that's messed
up. It's not gonna happen again.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.170
Eh, don't worry
about it. Just...

41:17.213 --> 41:19.346
Let me know you're okay next
time. It'll take two seconds.

41:19.389 --> 41:21.000
Will do.

41:21.043 --> 41:22.480
MATTY:
Hey, guys.

41:22.523 --> 41:25.787
Hey, there she is.
Welcome to the party, girl.

41:25.831 --> 41:30.183
I wanted to thank you for saving
everybody's bacon. Y-You're...

41:30.226 --> 41:32.751
Jack, you know how you don't
like to talk about Cairo?

41:32.794 --> 41:33.665
Yes, ma'am.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.754
Let's add Honduras to that list.

41:35.797 --> 41:36.972
Yes, ma'am.

41:37.016 --> 41:38.496
Where's the rest
of your boy band?

41:38.539 --> 41:39.540
They're all outside.

41:39.584 --> 41:41.150
Come out,
so I can introduce you.

41:41.194 --> 41:42.543
Okay, I'll be out there
in a second.All right.

41:42.587 --> 41:43.892
Open a cold one for me.

41:43.936 --> 41:47.026
Ooh, we gonna get loose tonight.

41:47.069 --> 41:48.244
I like it.
Take...

41:48.288 --> 41:50.333
Let go of it, dude.Okay, well, just...

41:50.377 --> 41:51.334
Don't...

41:52.205 --> 41:54.207
I'll grab you one.

41:56.470 --> 42:00.039
You look happy right now.

42:00.082 --> 42:01.693
Is that a problem?

42:01.736 --> 42:04.696
Well, no,
I'm just wondering why.

42:04.739 --> 42:06.045
Why?

42:06.088 --> 42:08.874
Maybe it's because
my best agent is back.

42:11.267 --> 42:13.095
Thank you.

42:13.139 --> 42:16.142
Welcome home, MacGyver.
