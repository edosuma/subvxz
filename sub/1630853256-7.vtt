WEBVTT

00:22.105 --> 00:23.273
Tabula rasa.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.482
What are you talking about?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.026
Tabula rasa.

00:26.109 --> 00:26.943
A blank slate.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.196
Do you know who I could've been
if everything had been different?

00:30.280 --> 00:32.323
-If anything had been different?

00:32.407 --> 00:34.409
The chance to be the me I could've been

00:34.492 --> 00:37.704
literally slid out of my body
on a 6 train platform.

00:37.787 --> 00:40.165
How, with all the time travel stories

00:40.248 --> 00:42.167
about people
accidentally obliterating themselves,

00:42.250 --> 00:44.461
do you find a way to make yourself double?

00:44.544 --> 00:46.588
I had to take her someplace safe.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.967
This is safe? Hmm?

00:51.051 --> 00:53.845
You have collapsed time, Nadia,

00:53.928 --> 00:56.890
and now we are back in this horrible,
evil freaking birthday party

00:56.973 --> 00:58.975
I spent lifetimes trying to escape!

00:59.059 --> 01:01.311
-Chicken's almost ready!

01:02.395 --> 01:04.355
Jesus Christ with this fucking song.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.984
I went through major shit, Nadia.
You don't think I wanted to change things?

01:08.068 --> 01:12.113
But no, I followed the rules of the train
because I am a good commuter.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.449
But you, you on the other hand,
you're just--

01:14.532 --> 01:18.203
Look, no kid should have to go through
what I went through, all right?

01:18.286 --> 01:20.538
Trust me, I've lived all sides of it.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.916
Who's a little<i> Rashomon</i> face?

01:24.334 --> 01:26.503
-I'm-- I'm sorry.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.756
A friend kidnapping her newborn self
then collapsing time is a hard boundary.

01:29.839 --> 01:30.882
Come on.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.135
-They went down…
-Oh boy.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.222
…alive, into the realm of the dead.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.515
Who-- who are they?

01:38.598 --> 01:40.266
Oh look at that.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.769
This used to be a school for Jews.

01:43.269 --> 01:46.564
Now, it's open-planned living
for the enlightened.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.776
I use the terms "now"
and "used to be" loosely.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.277
-Oh my God.
-Okay.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.447
-Who's Nadia Comăneci?

01:54.531 --> 01:57.367
-Yes, she is. Ten-ten-ten.
-God, oh God.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.244
Enough about me.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.453
How have you been?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.081
Can I hold her?

02:03.164 --> 02:06.042
Sure, but don't make it weird.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.418
She's me, you know?

02:10.755 --> 02:12.674
-Ah.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.300
Somebody likes you.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.344
This guy.

02:17.720 --> 02:22.183
Now, see, this is the type of shit
I was thinking about.

02:22.767 --> 02:23.852
Hey, baby.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.441
Okay, okay,
we-- we have to bring her back.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.651
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:31.734 --> 02:34.696
We cannot live
in this chaos forever. Look, look.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.489
Nadia, it's a simple decision. We just--

02:36.573 --> 02:40.910
Simple says you.
Me? I'm still exploring my options.

02:40.994 --> 02:41.911
What?

02:41.995 --> 02:45.123
I mean, the world is different, sure,
but it's not terrible.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.500
Guess what? There's time.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.669
There's time for everything.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.588
-Nadia, Nadia, please.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.215
Come on, man,
we've been through worse, all right?

02:54.299 --> 02:55.592
We can handle this.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.845
Hey, as Abraham used to say,

02:58.928 --> 03:03.892
"Trust that the fabric of space-time
is durable like Tyvek."

03:03.975 --> 03:04.809
Uh…

03:05.810 --> 03:09.564
Which is Sheol, where all dead go.

03:09.647 --> 03:13.067
The common grave for all humanity.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.987
Nadia, I understand
why you did this. I really do.

03:16.070 --> 03:19.699
Well, it makes sense,
you guilt-tripping me in front of a rabbi.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.159
Were you always this difficult?

03:21.242 --> 03:23.536
Please don't harass the baby.
She's in her formative years.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.080
-I'm so sorry. No yarmulke.
-Just relax, Alan.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.999
They're basically non-playable characters,

03:28.082 --> 03:31.544
just stuck in a loop, incapable
of deviating from preset grooves.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.922
To them, this is all status quo normal.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.591
Who wants a high-five? Yeah, hey.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.134
Hey. How you doing?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.928
Come here!

03:40.011 --> 03:42.180
This guy has always loved to hug, Alan.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.224
Hi. You want a light?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.308
There you go.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.518
You still look great, you know?

03:48.019 --> 03:49.187
All right. Hey.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.647
Hey, guys, how are ya?

03:50.730 --> 03:53.358
Look who's having white wine spritz.
That's great.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.318
Sweet birthday baby.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.780
It's laced
with cocaine, like the Israelis do it.

03:58.863 --> 03:59.864
How'd you know?

03:59.948 --> 04:01.866
I broke time.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.159
Oh, because you're so old.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.410
We should get out of here.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.372
Come on, Alan,
party's just getting started.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.831
And Ruth hasn't showed up yet.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.876
I've never had a birthday without her.
I'm not about to start now.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.462
-You want some chicken?
-I don't want your four-year-old chicken.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.715
Okay, well, I'll just put it in the oven
so it doesn't get cold.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.052
Oh, hey, hey.
Okay, yeah, I-- I don't know what to do.

04:21.135 --> 04:24.222
Hush, she's fine. She loves parties.
Look, I've got a bottle.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.516
Uh, I'll hold her. Is she-- she a her?

04:26.599 --> 04:28.017
She's a neither nor.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.270
-Hmm. Chic.
-Yes.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.230
Maxine.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.232
Maxine, it's--

04:36.025 --> 04:38.820
-Oh.
-What the hell? Dude, it's not ready.

04:39.862 --> 04:40.697
Oh!

04:41.656 --> 04:43.449
-Chicken's raw.
-Very interesting.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.326
Nadia, this is crazy.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.578
It's entropy, Alan. Right? Entropy.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.915
It's what gives us linear time,
irreversible processes,

04:50.999 --> 04:54.210
so things can only move
in one direction, into the future.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.504
You can't un-fry an egg, usually.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.798
You can't un-cook a chicken, usually.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.217
-Except, hey, look at us, right?
-Mm-hmm.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.386
-Now, we can.
-No, you cannot.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.389
-No, no, you cannot un-cook the baby.
-Come on. That's a little impressive.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.266
No, Nadia, you cannot un-cook that baby.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.143
-The baby's fine.
-Can we bring it back?

05:10.226 --> 05:11.060
She loves Lizzy.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.521
Ple-- please,
can we just bring her back?

05:13.604 --> 05:16.232
Do you not care that their lives
are literally disintegrating?

05:16.983 --> 05:19.652
They're artists, Alan.
They love the surreal.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.613
-See?
-Come back here.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.157
-Look how happy.
-Nadia. Nadia.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.409
If you cannot figure out
how to do this for me,

05:26.492 --> 05:28.119
or for your best friends, or for yourself,

05:28.202 --> 05:31.039
just do it so you don't go to hell
for being the most selfish person ever.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.667
I am painfully misunderstood.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.920
Hey, hey, hey!
Who invited these kids to my party?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.589
-I gotta go handle this.
-Yeah.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.549
Take my baby.

05:41.632 --> 05:42.467
Ha.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.428
Come on, let's get the fuck
out of here, kiddo.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.222
Nadia, whoa. Nadia, where are you going?

05:48.306 --> 05:50.099
Nadia, where are you go--

05:50.725 --> 05:51.809
-Oh.
-Hey, it's all right.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.228
Easy. She's not worth it, trust me.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.231
Which is a lesson
I've learned in spades from my ex-wife.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.151
She could never forget
my past transgressions, you know what--

06:00.234 --> 06:01.110
Hi.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.697
Fuck.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.325
-Fuck it.
-Excu-- Nadia.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.327
-Hey.
-Huh.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.497
Ah-ha! There's my birthday girl.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.958
No need to roll out
the red carpet for me, pumpkin.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.168
What'd I tell ya?

06:17.251 --> 06:18.795
Ruth's here. Not so bad.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.672
-Come on, man, just hold the baby.
-It's Ruth from four years ago.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.175
Yeah, I know it won't
make a difference, but, uh--

06:24.258 --> 06:26.386
-Well, I'll just wait. I'll wait.
-All right.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.514
Hiya, Ruthie.

06:29.597 --> 06:30.473
Oh…

06:30.556 --> 06:31.808
-Come on.
-We're waiting.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.851
-Oh, my fucking knees.
-Yeah.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.645
Upsie-pupsie, Ruthie.

06:35.728 --> 06:36.729
I can do it.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.481
-Yeah, I know you can.
-Okay.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.399
Okay.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.986
Um, Na-- Nadia?

06:45.822 --> 06:46.989
Yeah?

06:47.073 --> 06:47.907
Look.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.705
Ah.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.624
Would you look at that?

06:57.208 --> 06:59.669
They just keep coming.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.671
-Nadia?

07:01.754 --> 07:03.756
What? Aren't you coming in?

07:04.465 --> 07:06.384
Oh no. No, no.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.804
You cannot Irish exit your own party.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.100
I'm sorry I'm not in the hospital
with you right now, Ruthie.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.811
I'm trying. I am.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.563
You won't be alone, okay?

07:18.646 --> 07:22.525
Sweetheart, what have you
got to be sorry for?

07:22.608 --> 07:25.570
You're right here with me right now.

07:25.653 --> 07:30.658
Nothing in this world is easy
except pissing in the shower.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.452
-Okay.
-Nadia?

07:33.661 --> 07:34.996
-Nadia?
-Yeah?

07:36.873 --> 07:38.875
And there's my birthday girl.

07:40.793 --> 07:41.627
Uh…

07:42.128 --> 07:43.421
I fucked up.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.338
I know.

07:46.048 --> 07:49.469
Ugh. Yeah, let's take her back.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.137
Fire escape?

07:51.220 --> 07:53.055
I guess. Thank God.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.766
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:55.850 --> 07:57.977
boys and girls,

07:58.561 --> 08:02.482
experience the New York sky!

08:02.565 --> 08:04.817
-Ten cents a ride…
-I'm proud of you.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.278
-…for your first bona fide…

08:07.361 --> 08:09.322
…hydrogen balloon!

08:09.405 --> 08:11.407
Jesus. Oh shit.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.326
Told ya. Pamphlet.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.410
Oh hey.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.328
Yeah.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.245
Well, here.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.956
Yeah, two pockets.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.417
This balloon won't be here for long!

08:21.501 --> 08:23.878
All right, let's get this baby
back to the '80s.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.296
Experience the New York sky!

08:25.379 --> 08:27.924
<i>This is a downtown</i>
<i>local 6 train to Brooklyn Bridge,</i>

08:28.007 --> 08:31.260
<i>approaching the station.</i>
<i>Please stand away from the platform edge.</i>

08:31.344 --> 08:34.639
<i>-Stand clear of the closing doors.</i>
-Man, where's this fucking train?

08:34.722 --> 08:36.682
<i>-This is a Pelham Bay Park bound 6 train.</i>
-Come on.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.893
<i>Next stop, 77th Street, Lenox Hill.</i>

08:38.976 --> 08:40.770
Tell you, this baby's gonna be
a moody teenager

08:40.853 --> 08:42.897
by the time we get her back
if we don't get a move on.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.942
Spoiler alert, she gets her period at 12,

08:46.025 --> 08:48.069
so <i>basta la pasta.</i>

08:48.945 --> 08:51.113
<i>Please stand away</i>
<i>from the platform edge.</i>

08:52.031 --> 08:54.867
<i>This is a Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall</i>
<i>bound 6 train. Next stop…</i>

08:54.951 --> 08:57.078
This is ridiculous.
What if the train never comes?

08:57.161 --> 08:59.163
What if we're stuck here for forever?

08:59.247 --> 09:00.998
We should have a plan B just in case.

09:01.582 --> 09:05.169
Oh man. You know, you're getting
very stressed out, Alan, all right?

09:05.253 --> 09:07.088
-Why don't you hold the little baby?
-Oh no.

09:07.171 --> 09:11.634
It will help you calm down.
Ah, okay. There you go. That's right.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.511
My fucking neck is killing me.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.347
I swear to God, this is why people
get abortions. No offense, baby.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.432
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors.</i>

09:18.516 --> 09:20.768
<i>-The Metro City Police Department…</i>
-Hey.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.728
<i>-Remain aware of your surroundings.</i>
-Look.

09:22.812 --> 09:26.107
<i>-If you see something, say something.</i>
-Yo! Yo!

09:26.190 --> 09:28.276
Hey, you know where the trains are?

09:28.359 --> 09:30.444
Hey! Hey, slow down!

09:30.528 --> 09:31.362
Alan!

09:31.445 --> 09:34.448
-<i>We apologize for the delay.</i>
-Hey, man, I'm talking to you!

09:34.532 --> 09:35.533
<i>Now arriving--</i>

09:36.993 --> 09:37.827
This way.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.580
Hey, man,
do you know where the 6 train is?

09:42.540 --> 09:43.833
Shit.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.126
Horse?

09:45.209 --> 09:46.711
You work for the MTA now?

09:46.794 --> 09:49.714
What? No, Haircut,
I live down here with my wife. Fuck you.

09:49.797 --> 09:50.798
Can you help us?

09:50.881 --> 09:52.967
Uh, I'm looking for my train.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.261
It's number 6622.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.471
-For a price.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.724
Nadia, this guy is no help, okay? So--

09:59.807 --> 10:02.351
-The baby needs a diaper change.
-Come on, the baby's fine.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.604
We're both fathers. I respect that.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.064
Okay, we'll make a trade.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.107
A trade?

10:08.190 --> 10:09.191
It's good negotiating.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.902
I know where your train is. Follow me.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.863
Come on.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.656
Yeah. Uh--

10:18.117 --> 10:19.619
Everything falls down.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.706
Closer to the center of the Earth you are,
the closer you are to the truth. Gravity.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.292
I'm sorry, can we-- can we hurry?
We're kind of in a rush.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.418
You got time, man.

10:27.501 --> 10:30.546
Time as you understand was invented
to synchronize European train systems

10:30.630 --> 10:32.798
so that goods
could be moved across borders.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.425
Watch the third rail.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.555
Let me hold the baby.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.807
Uh, your hands seem so full already.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.518
Come on, just for a little bit.
Please? Let me hold her.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.187
What do you need, baby, huh?

10:46.270 --> 10:47.897
Babies are true materialists.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.733
-Alan, don't give Horse the baby.
-Is she okay?

10:50.816 --> 10:52.777
She's a subway baby. She's me, we're fine.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.446
As long as I'm still standing,
that means that she's okay.

10:56.030 --> 10:56.864
Fine.

10:57.531 --> 11:00.034
Follow the tracks, end of the line,
you'll see your train. Pay up.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.078
-For real?
-Yep. Pay up.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.874
-Money. Mm-hmm. I take cash.
-How's that?

11:06.957 --> 11:08.668
All right, 40 bucks, man. Not bad.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.710
I hear a jingle.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.212
-All right, keys.
-That's good. Go.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.380
Great, thanks.

11:12.463 --> 11:13.381
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.132
You too, bud. Pay up.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.807
Is that your fucking train, huh?
Is that your train?

11:22.890 --> 11:23.933
Is that your train?

11:24.016 --> 11:27.478
I don't know, man.
I'm an R32, number 6622, so…

11:27.561 --> 11:29.271
-How do you even know?
-Oh, come on, man.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.483
You gotta know your make and model.
That's Quantum Leaping 101.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.694
Run.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.697
Hey, Nadia.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.614
Yeah.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.492
Wardog. Yeah.

11:43.869 --> 11:47.623
Um, Oh! Nadia, hey.
We didn't think you were gonna show.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.042
-Uh--
-And you have a baby.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.544
Oh, cute baby.

11:51.627 --> 11:52.461
Uh…

11:53.629 --> 11:54.463
What's going on?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.591
I don't know.
The train's been stopped for 30 minutes.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.593
-We're gonna be late for the wake.

12:09.103 --> 12:09.937
Ah.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.106
-This isn't right.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.108
Hold up. Hold up.

12:14.191 --> 12:17.111
You don't like these flowers?
I thought Ruth loved orchids.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.405
Consider them gone.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.410
Hey. Hey, Nads.

12:24.493 --> 12:27.747
You have to stop
beating yourself up for not being there.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.707
What do you mean I don't get there?

12:29.790 --> 12:31.333
Ruth dies alone?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.461
After everything?

12:34.879 --> 12:37.131
I just talked to her on my birthday.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.675
Your birthday was a month ago.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.719
-It's April. It's April 30th.
-No.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.014
It is March 30th, okay?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.808
Today is still my birthday, so…

12:48.934 --> 12:50.019
you're in the future.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.729
-Nadia…
-It's okay.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.647
Grief doesn't move you in a straight line.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.400
Hey, do you-- do you know
what you're gonna say tonight?

12:58.152 --> 12:59.528
-It's okay.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.532
Um, "Do you believe
in the future of humanity?" Um, okay.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.745
<i>The 6 train is now departing…</i>

13:07.828 --> 13:10.122
Hey, come on.
Hey, hey, we need to get off this train.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.165
We need--

13:11.248 --> 13:12.875
We don't belong here, come on.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.002
Nadia, we have to bring
the baby back, right?

13:15.085 --> 13:16.712
I'm not leaving. Fuck that.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.048
If I don't make it to her deathbed,

13:19.131 --> 13:21.300
the least I can do
is show up to her fucking funeral!

13:21.383 --> 13:23.469
-No, Nadia! That's enough!
-All right?

13:23.552 --> 13:25.012
-Come on!
-Are they fucking?

13:25.095 --> 13:27.431
-Alan, I know how to fucking walk.
-Watch the baby.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.349
God!

13:31.227 --> 13:33.437
Nadia? Nadia, calm down.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.980
Nadia, please.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.816
Calm down?

13:36.899 --> 13:39.068
Man, it's fucking over, all right?

13:39.151 --> 13:41.070
I don't get there for Ruth.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.489
Wasn't there for the best mother I had.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.534
All this shit, for nothing.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.078
So, great.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.040
How the fuck do we get outta here? Yeah.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.709
I don't--

13:55.793 --> 13:56.877
Wait.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.712
Where are you going? Nadia?

14:02.967 --> 14:05.261
-I told you about Lenny, right?
-Oh yeah.

14:05.344 --> 14:08.180
I tried to tell him
that the wall was gonna come down.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.851
That I had solid information
from the future.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.686
Total control of the situation, right?

14:13.769 --> 14:14.687
Yeah.

14:14.770 --> 14:15.771
He went anyway.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.483
Well, you couldn't change anything.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.401
Closed loop.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.319
Right. Because of…

14:22.403 --> 14:23.696
Laws of physics.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.448
I was gonna say "human nature."

14:27.992 --> 14:30.494
We can't escape being the product
of things we can't change.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.289
Are you trying to say
that I'm not an original, man?

14:33.372 --> 14:34.331
No one is.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.666
Well, what about Bowie?

14:35.749 --> 14:37.084
That's not my point. Look,

14:38.043 --> 14:40.045
Ruth would not want you
to carry that guilt.

14:40.129 --> 14:44.758
Sweetheart, guilt,
it's a wasted emotion.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.677
He tried to escape. He tried to get out.

14:46.760 --> 14:50.055
Lenny went to West Berlin,
and I don't even know that he got there.

14:50.139 --> 14:50.973
I mean…

14:52.182 --> 14:54.018
I think I was supposed
to stop him from going,

14:54.101 --> 14:57.187
and I didn't even make it
in time to say goodbye.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.064
I don't know what I was supposed to do.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.734
I'm never gonna forgive myself.

15:01.817 --> 15:05.237
Alan, you're okay, all right?

15:05.321 --> 15:06.488
It's okay.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.532
It's just, it's a--

15:08.616 --> 15:09.867
It's a Coney Island.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.118
A what?

15:11.201 --> 15:14.413
The thing that would make
everything better

15:14.496 --> 15:16.373
if only it had happened, right?

15:16.457 --> 15:18.375
Or-- or didn't happen.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.754
You know, uh, an "if only."

15:24.006 --> 15:25.132
Do you hear that?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.887
Shit. Let me take her.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.051
Nadia?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.263
Nadia!

16:17.351 --> 16:18.352
Alan!

16:21.021 --> 16:22.523
Alan!

16:22.606 --> 16:23.732
Nadia.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.125
Shh.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.675
Nadia!

17:33.469 --> 17:34.470
Hmm.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.486
Oh shit.

17:54.782 --> 17:55.783
All right.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.835
Shit.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.714
Come on, would you?

18:11.340 --> 18:12.257
Come on.

18:16.804 --> 18:17.721
Fine.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.101
You win.

18:41.912 --> 18:42.746
Grandma?

18:48.127 --> 18:48.961
Alan.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.047
Look at you.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.341
What happened to Lenny?

18:56.009 --> 18:58.303
Lenny? I-- I don't know.

18:58.887 --> 19:02.057
You don't know? So was I supposed
to stop him from going then,

19:02.141 --> 19:03.934
or I shouldn't have done anything?

19:04.017 --> 19:06.770
I-- I shouldn't have done anything at all.
Why did I do anything?

19:06.854 --> 19:07.938
I fuck it all up.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.231
I always fuck it up.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.942
Alan, Alan, I don't know.
And that's all right.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.778
Everybody says that I'm just like you.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.781
He was never going to stay.
I was never going to go.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.450
I couldn't leave the life I was building.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.036
I helped him get out.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.330
There was no other way
it was supposed to happen.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.082
So I got it wrong.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.669
I just want answers. I just--

19:30.752 --> 19:32.212
I just wanna know.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.214
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being this way.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.841
You are just like me.

19:38.510 --> 19:42.598
We can't spend our lives
so scared of making the wrong move

19:42.681 --> 19:44.641
that-- that we never live at all.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.311
Don't be so afraid to live.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.189
Yeah, I killed myself, so I…

19:51.857 --> 19:54.026
I don't really know how to live with that.

19:57.321 --> 20:01.283
It all just seems
so much easier for everybody else.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.327
Am I wrong?

20:03.827 --> 20:05.871
My perfect baby boy.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.666
Didn't I tell you?

20:11.543 --> 20:13.503
You were too young. You don't remember.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.131
I'll tell you again…

20:18.008 --> 20:19.593
my perfect baby boy.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.429
Okay?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.682
What-- what is this place?

20:25.766 --> 20:26.808
Um,

20:26.892 --> 20:28.227
we call it the void.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.772
It's an empty pocket of space

20:31.855 --> 20:34.900
left over from a job
that was never completed.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.194
Am I dead?

20:40.322 --> 20:41.490
You must go.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.367
-Follow the blue lights.
-Okay.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.953
There's an emergency exit
around the corner

20:46.036 --> 20:47.371
that will take you to the surface.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.623
Okay, okay. Thank you.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.041
I was lost.

20:51.124 --> 20:54.711
There's so much empty space
beneath the city we've forgotten about.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.673
It's a wonder
the whole thing doesn't cave in.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.497
Look at that.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.416
That's good.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.835
Just a little bit of piss on my blazer.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.879
It's fine. It's why we buy clothes, right?

21:37.963 --> 21:39.798
-All right.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.259
Look at this.

21:44.970 --> 21:45.804
Okay.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.101
We got this. We got this.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.299
Hello.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.010
Am I dead?

22:26.136 --> 22:28.180
How am I supposed to answer
a question like that?

22:28.764 --> 22:31.308
So I'm not dead?

22:31.975 --> 22:34.978
Just because I came before you
doesn't mean I have all the answers.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.189
You're looking in the wrong place.

22:37.272 --> 22:41.526
Well, that is starting to become a theme.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.363
If you could choose your mother all over,

22:45.655 --> 22:46.990
would you choose me again?

23:16.603 --> 23:17.687
Ma…

23:18.980 --> 23:21.608
Yeah, I didn't choose you the first time,

23:21.691 --> 23:25.654
but I guess that's just
how the story goes, huh, Mom?

23:32.619 --> 23:33.787
Come on, kid.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.062
Please make room for my babies.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.983
Miss, please, give room for my babies.

24:05.026 --> 24:07.779
Hey, do you know what station this is?

24:07.863 --> 24:09.448
I don't know. I'm not a conductor.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.782
Nora, let's get her home.

24:10.866 --> 24:13.785
Uh, you had no obligation,
but you loved me anyway, right?

24:15.745 --> 24:16.872
Bye, Ruthie.

24:26.715 --> 24:30.051
<i>This is a southbound 6 train.</i>
<i>Next stop, Astor Place.</i>

24:41.605 --> 24:43.648
<i> Stand clear</i>
<i>of the closing doors.</i>

26:45.061 --> 26:46.605
Mmm. You hungry?

26:47.272 --> 26:48.106
Me too.
