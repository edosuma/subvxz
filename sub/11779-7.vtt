WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:04.471
[rock music]

00:51.785 --> 00:53.720
[rock music]

01:00.627 --> 01:02.929
-He made it.
-They didn't want me to go.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.063
-[man] Ruck!

01:05.131 --> 01:08.234
Yeah, baby!
How was it?

01:08.301 --> 01:10.503
-It was really tough.
-Is anybody else coming?

01:10.570 --> 01:12.405
[Ruck sighs]
[bleep].

01:14.474 --> 01:16.776
-[Melissa] What's going on?
-That's it.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.211
-Two let go.
-What?

01:18.278 --> 01:19.913
-[Jim] What?
-[Sausage] Yeah.

01:19.979 --> 01:21.080
Shut the [bleep] up.

01:21.147 --> 01:22.449
[Sausage] They let
Keith go first,

01:22.515 --> 01:24.217
and then they let Bubba go.

01:24.284 --> 01:27.620
{\an8}No [bleep] way.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.255
-Really serious now.
-There's really no place

01:29.322 --> 01:31.391
to hide anymore,
no more safe tattoos.

01:31.458 --> 01:34.794
That's a big one.
That's a game changer.

01:34.861 --> 01:37.096
I don't know about you, man,
but I'm happy that they did...

01:37.163 --> 01:39.499
-Double?
-...two people, [bleep], yeah.

01:39.566 --> 01:42.569
I hope they do
triple elimination next time.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.103
Let's get [bleep] done
quicker, dude.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.638
I can't wait to get
to the end.

01:45.705 --> 01:48.041
-[Scott groans]
-I'm getting impatient.

01:48.107 --> 01:49.676
I know you'll be
in the finale.

01:49.742 --> 01:52.212
I know I'll be there,
and I have a feeling

01:52.278 --> 01:53.513
it's gonna be Sausage there,
dude.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.249
-Yeah, me too.
-Sausage wants it really bad.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.117
I question how much

01:58.184 --> 02:00.920
Halo's heart is
into this competition.

02:00.987 --> 02:02.121
[Halo] Do me a favor, y'all.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.724
Don't assume
that I'm not in this.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.794
You've come up shy
in a couple of challenges.

02:07.861 --> 02:08.961
That doesn't necessarily
mean, like,

02:09.027 --> 02:10.395
my head's not in the game
or anything like that.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.532
It's not like I'm
out of the competition.

02:12.599 --> 02:15.401
[Halo] <i> Scott and Matti can have</i>
<i>their little alliance</i>

02:15.468 --> 02:17.437
{\an8}and hold hands their whole way
through the competition,

02:17.504 --> 02:19.339
{\an8}but from now on,
I plan on beating

02:19.405 --> 02:21.908
<i>both of them</i>
<i>single-handedly.</i>

02:28.781 --> 02:30.817
[rock music]

02:35.355 --> 02:37.991
Oh, dope!

02:39.192 --> 02:41.628
Ooh!
This is awesome!

02:41.694 --> 02:45.598
This is my [bleep] right here!
Bam.

02:46.966 --> 02:47.934
[Dave] Welcome, artists.

02:48.001 --> 02:52.372
This week, we're testing
your adaptability.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.641
{\an8}Adaptability is just
being able to do

02:54.707 --> 02:57.277
{\an8}everything that comes your way--
a hard canvas, an easy canvas,

02:57.343 --> 02:59.345
<i>light skin, dark skin.</i>

02:59.412 --> 03:01.481
All of that is adaptability.

03:01.548 --> 03:04.050
Today, your canvases
are risk-takers.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.252
For this challenge,
you must tattoo your canvas

03:06.319 --> 03:10.590
with a word that represents how
they get the most out of life.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.892
Lettering is incredibly
difficult to tattoo

03:12.959 --> 03:16.729
because it requires
clean, consistent lines.

03:16.796 --> 03:20.466
{\an8}If you can't move smooth,
fluid lines

03:20.533 --> 03:21.901
<i>all the way</i>
<i>through your design,</i>

03:21.968 --> 03:24.370
your lettering's gonna
look like [bleep].

03:24.437 --> 03:26.573
But that's not all.
You must also incorporate

03:26.639 --> 03:28.408
an image into your design.

03:28.474 --> 03:31.544
You must use adaptability
to make the image

03:31.611 --> 03:34.547
and the lettering
work together perfectly.

03:34.614 --> 03:35.915
[Matti] <i> I pretty much suck</i>
<i>at lettering.</i>

03:35.982 --> 03:37.717
{\an8}I'm not looking forward
to this challenge.

03:37.784 --> 03:40.486
Your canvases
have been randomly assigned

03:40.553 --> 03:42.322
and you'll have three hours
to tattoo.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.024
Let's head inside
and meet your canvases.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.364
-Hi.
-How you doing?

03:51.431 --> 03:53.066
-Hi.
-[Dave] Artists,

03:53.132 --> 03:56.936
your time begins now.

03:57.003 --> 03:59.072
-What do you want it to say?
-"Triumph."

03:59.138 --> 04:00.306
-"Triumph."
-"Triumph."

04:00.373 --> 04:01.608
[Oliver] <i> These artists need to</i>
<i>show adaptability</i>

04:01.674 --> 04:04.644
{\an8}and integrate words
with their design.

04:04.711 --> 04:05.778
-"Shred."
-"Shred."

04:05.845 --> 04:06.846
Like you're gonna
shred them out.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.948
-Yeah, exactly.
-Tota-- okay.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.584
The word is obviously
gonna be a focal point,

04:11.651 --> 04:13.987
<i>but you don't want it</i>
<i>to take away from your design.</i>

04:14.053 --> 04:15.989
It has to be one piece.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.190
-What's the word you want?
-"Conquer," to represent

04:18.257 --> 04:20.892
my conquer over my addition.

04:20.959 --> 04:23.096
I come from a history
of addiction also.

04:23.162 --> 04:26.499
{\an8}I wasted my life for about
eight years on methamphetamines.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.201
I did nine months
in a rehab home.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.268
I did ten months
in a rehab home.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.004
[Jim] <i> Because of our</i>
<i>similar histories,</i>

04:31.070 --> 04:34.340
<i>my canvas and I are able</i>
<i>to come up with a great idea.</i>

04:34.407 --> 04:36.009
I know I can
rock this one out.

04:36.075 --> 04:37.877
[woman] I'm kind of leaving it
in your hands,

04:37.944 --> 04:40.847
so have as much creative freedom
as you want.

04:40.913 --> 04:41.714
Sweet.

04:41.781 --> 04:42.882
<i>Now that Scott and Matti</i>

04:42.949 --> 04:44.884
<i>have set a fire under my ass,</i>
<i>I plan on taking</i>

04:44.951 --> 04:48.021
{\an8}this competition by the balls.

04:48.087 --> 04:49.956
<i>The main way I'm gonna show</i>
<i>adaptability</i>

04:50.023 --> 04:52.291
is by how the letters
actually adapt well

04:52.358 --> 04:56.663
to the design part of it
to make one solid, smooth piece.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.998
Two hours remaining,
everybody.

04:59.065 --> 05:00.566
[Lydia] <i> My canvas wants</i>
<i>realistic hands</i>

05:00.633 --> 05:01.701
<i>holding the world,</i>

05:01.768 --> 05:06.072
{\an8}and the word he wants done
in tribal-- tribal.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.308
<i>It's gonna look horrible.</i>
<i>It's not gonna flow.</i>

05:09.375 --> 05:11.010
I think I'm screwed.

05:11.077 --> 05:14.881
-What is this right here?
-[Kyle] That is a petal falling.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.116
I thought it kind of added
to the sentiment of it.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.419
{\an8}All I want to do
is make America proud of me.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.221
I want to show them that there's
a reason they voted me back.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.691
<i>There's such an added pressure</i>
<i>that I didn't understand</i>

05:24.757 --> 05:27.260
last time.
I get it now.

05:27.326 --> 05:30.596
One hour remaining.
One hour left to go, everybody.

05:32.231 --> 05:33.232
I think we're doing good.

05:33.299 --> 05:34.200
<i>To make the lettering</i>

05:34.267 --> 05:35.902
<i>just as extreme</i>
<i>as what the word's</i>

05:35.968 --> 05:38.371
{\an8}trying to say,
that's key in this design.

05:38.438 --> 05:42.308
<i>"Shred" means really fast,</i>
<i>broken-up, gnarly lettering.</i>

05:42.375 --> 05:45.244
[Scott] <i> Tattoos really reflect</i>
<i>the artist that are doing 'em.</i>

05:45.311 --> 05:48.681
{\an8}If the artist is really wimpy,
you're gonna get wimpy tattoos.

05:51.384 --> 05:52.719
{\an8}My canvas wants
graffiti letters.

05:52.785 --> 05:56.089
I'm a graffiti artist.
This is it right here.

05:56.155 --> 05:58.458
<i>Graffiti letters are big.</i>
<i>They're bulky.</i>

05:58.524 --> 06:00.026
You can't do that stuff small.

06:01.694 --> 06:05.498
Yeah, yeah, it's good...
when I finish.

06:05.565 --> 06:09.969
Five, four, three, two, one.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.305
That's it,
machines down, time's up.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.407
-Whew.
-No more ink.

06:14.474 --> 06:15.675
What does it say, though?

06:15.742 --> 06:18.511
[Scott] T-R-I-U-M-P-H,
"Triumph."

06:18.578 --> 06:19.712
"Triumph."

06:19.779 --> 06:23.282
<i>You can't even read</i>
<i>what Scott's tattoo says.</i>

06:23.349 --> 06:26.285
{\an8}I definitely know I did
a better piece than Scott today.

06:26.352 --> 06:28.421
[Scott] I can't believe you
beasted that out in three hours.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.223
[Halo] <i> Thank you, Scott,</i>
<i>for talking all that [bleep],</i>

06:30.289 --> 06:32.325
because now I'm coming out
in beast mode.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.029
-[Dave] King Ruck.
-This tattoo obviously

06:37.096 --> 06:38.931
is not finished.
Being adaptable

06:38.998 --> 06:41.667
is about taking their ideas,
making art the customer's

06:41.734 --> 06:43.369
gonna be happy with
that you can finish

06:43.436 --> 06:45.304
within the time period.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.272
-[Dave] Jim.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.573
[Oliver] The lettering
is super crisp.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.041
It stands apart from the lion.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.110
This is perfect
for what this client asked for.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.846
-[Dave] Jay.
-[Jay] Adaptability

06:53.913 --> 06:55.915
is all about walk-ins,
so I just went at it

06:55.982 --> 06:57.784
the way I used to take walk-ins,
no reference.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.685
-Just draw it up and go.
-[Oliver] It is a little off

06:59.752 --> 07:01.621
in the shape and the design.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.456
A little bit of reference
would've helped you out.

07:04.490 --> 07:05.491
-[Dave] Melissa.

07:05.558 --> 07:06.626
-[Oliver] When you have
lettering

07:06.692 --> 07:07.994
mixed in with the design,
the lettering needs

07:08.060 --> 07:09.562
to be bolder
to make it stand apart

07:09.629 --> 07:11.964
from every other line.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.900
-[Dave] Sausage.
-[Chris] This style of lettering

07:13.966 --> 07:15.334
you chose,
it fits the image

07:15.401 --> 07:18.704
because it gives us
that thrasher design aesthetic.

07:18.771 --> 07:19.906
It's a great job.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.575
[Jay] <i> This guy wanted</i>
<i>a badass design</i>

07:22.642 --> 07:24.677
<i>and he got design</i>
<i>that you would see</i>

07:24.744 --> 07:27.046
{\an8}on a little kid's lunch box.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.183
Lydia, where did you get
this font from?

07:30.249 --> 07:32.985
He loves tribal.
I wanted to do script.

07:33.052 --> 07:34.954
[Oliver] If your guy wants
tribal, do it.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.856
Capturing that tribal feel
of the lettering

07:36.923 --> 07:38.124
is a little bit lost.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.793
You basically just have
bold, pointy letters.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.262
-[Dave] Halo.
-I'm a big pit bull guy.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.665
The smile that the dog has,
it's the one

07:45.731 --> 07:47.433
that you're looking for
when you get home,

07:47.500 --> 07:48.668
and you captured it.

07:48.734 --> 07:51.404
-[Oliver] The lettering
especially is very, very nice.

07:51.470 --> 07:54.740
The fine details are really
what make it stand out.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.310
-[Dave] Matti.
-[Chris] I'm a big fan

07:57.376 --> 08:00.446
of simple lettering,
but I like to see spacing

08:00.513 --> 08:01.881
exactly the same.

08:01.948 --> 08:04.016
You got to make
that lettering dead even.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.085
[Halo] <i> Matti should worry less</i>
<i>about talking [bleep] about me</i>

08:06.152 --> 08:07.954
{\an8}and get his head
back in the game,

08:08.020 --> 08:11.057
<i>'cause his tattoo looks</i>
<i>like straight garbage today.</i>

08:11.991 --> 08:13.326
-[Dave] Scott.
-You showed

08:13.392 --> 08:14.827
great adaptability in this,
being able to pull off

08:14.894 --> 08:16.162
graffiti lettering.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.897
[Oliver] It's kind of hard to
read, but that's kind of

08:17.964 --> 08:19.799
the idea of
graffiti-style writing,

08:19.866 --> 08:21.434
so I think you did
a very good job.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.501
-[Dave] Kyle.

08:22.568 --> 08:23.703
-[Chris] This is a nice,
soft tattoo,

08:23.769 --> 08:25.738
but you definitely need
the other side of the veins

08:25.805 --> 08:28.641
in the leaves.
I would like to see that stem

08:28.708 --> 08:30.710
cut back in a silhouette
behind the "Carpe"

08:30.776 --> 08:32.378
to give us that inference
that it's back there,

08:32.445 --> 08:35.014
but you gave your client
a really nice tattoo today.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.749
[Kyle] <i> Of course the judges find</i>
<i>several things</i>

08:36.816 --> 08:38.284
{\an8}they don't like
about my tattoo.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.653
<i>It's frustrating,</i>
<i>especially when</i>

08:40.720 --> 08:42.621
they find nothing wrong
with Scott's tattoo,

08:42.688 --> 08:44.757
<i>even though its flag</i>
<i>is going backwards</i>

08:44.824 --> 08:46.792
and you can't read
what it says.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.596
All right, guys.
Today's challenge, adaptability.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.198
I'm putting King Ruck
in the bottom

08:52.265 --> 08:53.933
just for not finishing.
You have to be adaptable

08:54.000 --> 08:55.434
to your time limit.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.470
Something that surprised me
today was Matti's turn out.

08:57.536 --> 09:01.207
[Chris] This is the first design
that's a total hiccup.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.642
[Oliver] And that lettering
was weak.

09:02.708 --> 09:06.045
I think what we're seeing
out of Matti is extreme fatigue.

09:06.112 --> 09:07.914
This isn't a place
to be taking a rest.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.516
[Dave] Sausage came up
with his own lettering

09:10.583 --> 09:13.019
that fit
the extreme sports vibe.

09:13.085 --> 09:14.654
[Oliver] Very solid,
very clean tattoo.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.057
Yeah, one of the top tattoos
of the day, undoubtedly Halo.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.192
[Chris] The way that he used
all of the shading

09:20.259 --> 09:22.061
and left little hints
of open skin

09:22.128 --> 09:23.963
really capture the look
of that dog.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.331
[Oliver] And badass lettering.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.966
All right, so it looks like
we have a decision?

09:27.033 --> 09:29.769
-We do.
-Let's go let 'em know.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.771
Today, we asked you to
use your adaptability

09:31.837 --> 09:35.241
to create a tattoo
with an image and lettering

09:35.308 --> 09:36.575
that flowed together
perfectly.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.412
Some of you
did not impress us.

09:39.478 --> 09:42.348
Those of you that struggled,
you know who you are.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.850
If this was an elimination,
you guys would be

09:44.917 --> 09:46.485
in some [bleep],
and the way

09:46.552 --> 09:48.854
this competition's going,
you never know if this

09:48.921 --> 09:50.523
could be an elimination.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.729
You got lucky today.
You dodged a bullet.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.265
Some of you succeeded.
Halo.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.033
[Oliver] For you to put
these two elements together

10:01.100 --> 10:03.436
in such a nice way,
very good job.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.738
-[Dave] Sausage.
-[Chris] Sausage,

10:05.805 --> 10:08.307
your adaptability, man.
Knowing that any tattoo

10:08.374 --> 10:10.276
that comes into the shop,
you can knock it out and do it

10:10.343 --> 10:12.812
with some flair and some style,
that's the kind of thing

10:12.878 --> 10:15.081
that wins this competition.

10:15.147 --> 10:17.149
The judges have decided
that the winner

10:17.216 --> 10:20.052
of today's
Flash Challenge is...

10:21.120 --> 10:24.523
-...Halo.
-[Sausage] Good job, buddy.

10:24.590 --> 10:25.624
Thank you.

10:27.059 --> 10:28.327
[Chris] Man, I've had my finger
in your chest

10:28.394 --> 10:31.230
for a few critiques,
and today you delivered.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.166
The incorporation of the design
to the lettering

10:34.233 --> 10:38.137
with the smooth application
really stood out from the pack.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.106
[Dave] Halo, you will have
the power to assign

10:40.172 --> 10:43.209
all the human canvases
in the elimination tattoo.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.344
[Halo] <i> This shift of power</i>
<i>has just begun.</i>

10:45.411 --> 10:48.214
{\an8}You're gonna see a lot of wins
out of me from now on.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.049
[Dave] Head back to the loft
and prepare to meet

10:50.116 --> 10:53.152
your human canvases
for the elimination tattoo.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.725
[rock music]

11:02.461 --> 11:04.063
What the [bleep]
is going on?

11:04.130 --> 11:05.364
This doesn't make
any sense to me.

11:05.431 --> 11:08.434
My piece had beautiful
technical execution,

11:08.501 --> 11:10.403
and your piece had
bad line work in it.

11:10.469 --> 11:11.670
-[Scott] Everybody feels...
-It's hard to sit there

11:11.737 --> 11:13.406
and watch.
-...that I shouldn't be winning,

11:13.472 --> 11:14.540
and they're just
pissed off, so--

11:14.607 --> 11:16.409
No, I'm upset
at the unfairness of it,

11:16.475 --> 11:18.644
because your piece
was not as good as mine.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.280
I'm not gonna sit here
and [bleep] battle with you that

11:21.347 --> 11:22.548
my [bleep] piece is better.
-Oh, of course you're not.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.383
You're standing
at the top of the hill.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.352
You have not had
a bad critique yet,

11:26.419 --> 11:28.421
even though there's things that
anybody can pick apart.

11:28.487 --> 11:30.289
They find the most perfect
[bleep] in your tattoo.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.323
They all tell me things

11:31.390 --> 11:32.491
wrong with my tattoo,
and I'll be like,

11:32.558 --> 11:34.160
"Yeah, okay, cool."
-They didn't!

11:34.226 --> 11:35.828
They [bleep] didn't, man.

11:35.895 --> 11:37.530
They didn't tell you
anything was wrong with it.

11:37.596 --> 11:40.332
There was nothing that was said
about your lettering

11:40.399 --> 11:42.668
that was not right.
Conspiracy or not,

11:42.735 --> 11:45.304
think about that, man.
-Dude, it's [bleep] squashed.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.106
-We're on to the next challenge.
-Oh, it feels that way.

11:47.173 --> 11:48.274
You cry about [bleep]
that's weeks away--

11:48.340 --> 11:49.775
When you got a judge
that's sucking your [bleep],

11:49.842 --> 11:51.210
[bleep], yeah.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.212
[Scott] <i> Kyle's being selfish</i>
<i>and immature.</i>

11:53.279 --> 11:56.682
{\an8}-He's throwing a fit.
-[bleep] crazy time.

11:56.749 --> 11:57.716
You're so worried
about what I'm doing.

11:57.783 --> 11:59.452
Worry about what the [bleep]
you're doing

11:59.518 --> 12:01.587
and worry
about the next challenge, man.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.193
[rock music]

12:07.927 --> 12:09.562
{\an8}[needle buzzing]

12:10.729 --> 12:12.865
[rock music]

12:14.633 --> 12:16.035
Welcome to
the elimination tattoo.

12:16.102 --> 12:19.071
Choke, and you can
kiss $100,000,

12:19.138 --> 12:20.473
a feature in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

12:20.539 --> 12:23.576
and the title of Ink Master
goodbye.

12:23.642 --> 12:26.412
You'll be judged by Oliver Peck,
Chris Núñez, and myself,

12:26.479 --> 12:28.481
but we're not
your only critics.

12:28.547 --> 12:31.083
Each week, you'll also
be judged by America.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.419
Viewers at home
will scour every detail

12:33.486 --> 12:36.822
of your elimination tattoos
at InkMaster.Spike.com

12:36.889 --> 12:40.126
and vote for the tattoo
that they think is the best.

12:40.192 --> 12:43.162
America's vote will have
a massive impact

12:43.229 --> 12:44.797
at the live finale.

12:44.864 --> 12:47.766
We also have
a very special guest judge.

12:47.833 --> 12:51.237
Tattooing for 26 years,
he's an icon in the industry.

12:51.303 --> 12:54.373
The owner of Temple Tattoo
and Tattoo 13

12:54.440 --> 12:57.977

Freddy Corbin.

12:58.043 --> 13:02.281
-Oh, [bleep].
-[all clapping]

13:02.348 --> 13:05.050
[man] <i> My style is</i>
<i>black and gray, religious,</i>

13:05.117 --> 13:06.085
<i>Day of the Dead.</i>

13:06.152 --> 13:09.054
{\an8}I think tattoos
should be timeless.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.524
-Hi, guys.
-Sweet.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.492
[Dave] In the
elimination tattoo,

13:13.559 --> 13:14.693
it's more important than ever

13:14.760 --> 13:17.429
to win tattoo of the day,
because the winner

13:17.496 --> 13:20.432
must put one artist
up for elimination.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.769
This week, we're testing
your adaptability.

13:23.836 --> 13:26.438
[Jay] <i> Adaptability is being able</i>
<i>to do whatever</i>

13:26.505 --> 13:28.474
{\an8}the next thing that walks
through the door is,

13:28.541 --> 13:29.942
{\an8}and you never know
what that's gonna be.

13:30.009 --> 13:33.979
There's no better test
of adaptability than a cover-up.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.882
[Matti] <i> Knew it. Called it.</i>

13:36.949 --> 13:39.685
{\an8}Cover-ups are tricky because
trying to place the design

13:39.752 --> 13:42.354
{\an8}over top of an existing design,
you need to be able

13:42.421 --> 13:44.557
<i>to manipulate that picture</i>
<i>and put things</i>

13:44.623 --> 13:46.225
in the right place
so you cannot tell

13:46.292 --> 13:47.359
that's a cover-up.

13:47.426 --> 13:48.427
Tattoos are forever,

13:48.494 --> 13:51.230
and only about 15% of the people
who get them

13:51.297 --> 13:52.965
regret their decision.
-Yeah.

13:53.032 --> 13:56.302
[Dave] However, the number-one
reason for regretting a tattoo

13:56.368 --> 13:59.205
is a failed relationship.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.774
Your canvases today
made that mistake

14:01.840 --> 14:04.543
and they're counting on you
to help them fix it.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.981
-[bleep].
-There is one last thing

14:09.048 --> 14:11.050
that you should know.
This week, the competition

14:11.116 --> 14:14.353
is going to get even tighter.

14:14.420 --> 14:18.724
Not one, but two artists
will be packing their machines

14:18.791 --> 14:20.593
and going home.

14:20.659 --> 14:21.927
-[all groaning]
-What the [bleep]?

14:21.994 --> 14:23.295
Are you serious?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.597
-[Dave] Absolutely.
-[bleep].

14:24.663 --> 14:26.398
No more pacifiers.
That's it.

14:26.465 --> 14:27.900
Let's do some nice tattoos
and make it happen.

14:27.967 --> 14:28.834
Fight to stay.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.102
[Oliver] The top people
in this game

14:30.169 --> 14:32.171
are gonna have to fight.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.606
We've got to get rid
of the slack.

14:33.672 --> 14:36.141
If you're comfortable,
you're not gonna fight for it.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.576
That's how it's got to be.

14:37.643 --> 14:40.412
[Scott] <i> Oh, my God, you can</i>
<i>smell the fear in the air.</i>

14:40.479 --> 14:42.748
<i>I couldn't be happier.</i>
<i>I know it's not gonna be me.</i>

14:42.815 --> 14:44.650
{\an8}-Hell [bleep] yeah.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.517
[Melissa sighs]

14:45.584 --> 14:47.186
Let's meet your canvases.

14:47.253 --> 14:48.754
[rock music]

14:50.322 --> 14:52.625
[Dave] Halo, you won
the Flash Challenge.

14:52.691 --> 14:55.794
You now have all the power
to assign the human canvases.

14:55.861 --> 14:57.963
Don't make any decisions
you'll regret.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.499
[Halo] <i> My strategy is to make</i>
<i>sure that I give myself</i>

15:00.566 --> 15:02.134
<i>the easiest thing</i>
<i>to cover up,</i>

15:02.201 --> 15:03.902
{\an8}and give everyone else
some crap.

15:03.969 --> 15:06.672
I have a library stamp
that says "Property of Steve"

15:06.739 --> 15:07.973
on my thigh.
-[Halo laughs]

15:08.040 --> 15:10.075
-No way.
-[Halo] Oh, awesome.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.344
-Holy [bleep].
-I have my ex's name

15:12.411 --> 15:13.879
on my crotch.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.181
[Jay laughs]

15:16.248 --> 15:17.883
I want to get
a cherry blossom tree.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.853
Nothing should ever
grow out of a vagina.

15:20.919 --> 15:23.255
I'd like to get a groundhog,
muscular looking.

15:23.322 --> 15:24.957
So to cover
this whole thing up?

15:26.592 --> 15:29.194
I would like to get
a sea turtle on my butt.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.596
-[Halo] Can I see?
-[woman] Yup.

15:30.663 --> 15:34.199
I want a butterfly
where one half is Italian flag

15:34.266 --> 15:35.868
and the other half
is a African flag.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.439
I have a matching drunk lion
tattoo.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.375
-This is my ex-husband.
-Wow.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.810
You guys got 'em together,
huh?

15:44.877 --> 15:45.878
We did.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.646
Let me see what you got.
This guy right here?

15:47.713 --> 15:48.781
{\an8}Mm-hmm.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.651
[Jay] <i> Those things are black.</i>

15:53.052 --> 15:54.520
{\an8}Bad.

15:56.755 --> 15:57.756
[Scott] <i> I think Halo</i>
<i>is playing the game.</i>

15:57.823 --> 16:00.192
{\an8}I just think that he's scared
to show it.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.460
Can I see
what you got again?

16:01.527 --> 16:03.495
[Jay laughs]
That's you.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.164
[Scott] <i> I don't care what design</i>
<i>is handed to me.</i>

16:05.230 --> 16:07.266
I'm gonna do
a really strong tattoo

16:07.333 --> 16:09.201
and still win
this goddamn thing.

16:10.669 --> 16:14.006
Canvases, one-by-one,
please read the artist's name

16:14.073 --> 16:15.808

16:18.143 --> 16:19.445

16:20.879 --> 16:22.047

16:22.848 --> 16:24.983
-I'm not going home.
-Jim.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.078
[Dave] Remember, artists,
after the elimination tattoo,

16:53.145 --> 16:55.180
the human canvas jury
will vote on the tattoo

16:55.247 --> 16:57.583
that they think is the worst,
and put one artist

16:57.649 --> 16:59.351
up for elimination,

16:59.418 --> 17:01.353
and winner
of the tattoo of the day

17:01.420 --> 17:03.555
will also put an artist
up for elimination.

17:03.622 --> 17:05.824
You will have six hours
to create a cover-up.

17:05.891 --> 17:10.829
Based on your work,
two of you will be closing shop.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.698
Good luck.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.900
{\an8}Adaptability is important
in a cover-up tattoo

17:14.967 --> 17:16.167
<i>because you take</i>
<i>what's existing,</i>

17:16.234 --> 17:18.503
<i>create something around it,</i>
<i>and you have to become</i>

17:18.569 --> 17:19.505
a magician
and make it disappear.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.939
-Nice to meet you.
-What's up, man?

17:21.006 --> 17:24.041
Come with me, young lady.
We're gonna work this out.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.144
As long as it's covered.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.680
-It's a sea turtle?
-Yeah, swimming this way.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.082
You don't want him
going to your butthole.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.651
-[woman laughs]
-"I'm swimming in, shorty."

17:32.718 --> 17:34.386
We've been divorced
for a long time.

17:34.453 --> 17:37.790
That's part of my past that
I'd rather just move on with.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.893
Double horseshoes, and there
were some other things.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.762
[woman] Like, a barbed wire and
ribbon coming down, flowers.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.164
Somewhere I'd like
to put a cross,

17:45.230 --> 17:48.801
but then I want my boy's names
and my grandson's name.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.035
Okay.

17:50.102 --> 17:53.038
{\an8}All the things she want
in this tattoo is killing me.

17:53.105 --> 17:54.807
{\an8}My canvas wants an engine.

17:54.873 --> 17:57.743
It's called the intake.
See how it comes

17:57.810 --> 17:58.911
out of either side of the head?
-Yup.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.846
[Melissa] <i> When you go in</i>
<i>for a cover-up,</i>

18:00.913 --> 18:02.948
the best idea to have
is no idea.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.317
I've been building motorcycles
since I was three.

18:05.384 --> 18:06.985
We're having to cover up
your mistake,

<i>so coming with this</i>
<i>very specific idea</i>

18:09.688 --> 18:11.190
that might not work
is just a bad idea.

Do I know a lot about engines?
No, but I know about tattoos.

18:14.126 --> 18:16.862
I feel like this canvas is
really gonna [bleep] me over.

18:24.570 --> 18:27.039
I have no [bleep] clue
what a V-twin engine looks like.

18:27.105 --> 18:29.241
I'm not too experienced
in new school.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.710
-She wants a new school V-twin?
-Yeah.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.713
She doesn't want
this big circle part.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.148
It's just an air cleaner.

18:36.215 --> 18:38.817
Well, isn't this attached
to that hole behind there,

18:38.884 --> 18:41.920
or no?
'Cause that's what she wants.

18:41.987 --> 18:43.021
No.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.022
[Melissa] <i> I'm pretty stressed</i>
<i>right now.</i>

18:44.089 --> 18:46.558
They're gonna cut
another two artists.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.260
I could really be in trouble.

18:48.327 --> 18:51.163
-You need a carburetor on it.
-What is that?

18:51.230 --> 18:54.066
That's a carburetor,
brings fuel into your heads.

18:54.132 --> 18:56.735
<i>Even if I help Melissa,</i>
<i>she's gonna fumble this one.</i>

18:56.802 --> 18:58.070
<i>Melissa's definitely not</i>
<i>a threat to me</i>

18:58.136 --> 18:59.705
{\an8}because my tattoos
are better.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.173
Okay, so if I just leave it
open like this?

19:01.240 --> 19:03.775
-I can do that?
-That might be better, yeah.

19:06.078 --> 19:09.882
You have six hours to show
adaptability with a cover-up.

19:09.948 --> 19:13.485
Your time begins now.

19:13.552 --> 19:14.620
-Let's do this.
-All right.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.722
There ya go.

19:16.788 --> 19:18.156
{\an8}Last week,
we did a double elimination

19:18.223 --> 19:20.092
{\an8}and it's really tightening
the competition up,

19:20.158 --> 19:22.528
<i>and we just want to keep</i>
<i>the steamroller going.</i>

19:22.594 --> 19:23.595
[Halo] Perfect.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.264
[Oliver] <i> Now's not the time</i>
<i>to relax.</i>

19:25.330 --> 19:26.532
It's time to fight.

19:27.466 --> 19:28.901
[needle buzzing]

19:28.967 --> 19:30.068
Pretty much the same thing,
what I drew on you.

19:30.135 --> 19:33.171
[woman] Is there any way
that you can move him over

19:33.238 --> 19:35.707
and take the Gavin here off?
-Mm-hmm.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.709
And then do, like,
side ribbons?

19:37.776 --> 19:39.011
[King Ruck] <i> I really</i>
<i>don't like this.</i>

19:39.077 --> 19:40.746
{\an8}The last thing I need right now
is a headache.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.848
[woman] This is his son.
I want it kind of

19:42.915 --> 19:44.716
where I can put the kids
under him.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.919
There's no way to try
and peg that in.

19:46.985 --> 19:49.922
Stop hindering me
with your [bleep] ideas.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.323
I've been doing this
for a while,

19:51.390 --> 19:54.426
and I have to do this
to where it actually works.

19:54.493 --> 19:56.061
I got a bad canvas, man.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.665
-You ready for this?
-[woman sighs]

19:59.731 --> 20:03.001
[needle buzzing]

20:05.404 --> 20:07.940
[Matti] <i> I get the ex-husband,</i>
<i>Ruck gets the ex-wife,</i>

20:08.006 --> 20:11.209
{\an8}and we both have to cover up
a black, drunken lion.

20:11.276 --> 20:13.145
I'm a firm believer that,
like, if there is a tattoo

20:13.211 --> 20:15.213
that you don't like,
you can always cover it up.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.851
<i>I really don't have any</i>
<i>problems trying to outdo Ruck.</i>

20:19.918 --> 20:20.919
[man] Did you already finish
the backside of that?

20:20.986 --> 20:23.855
-Yup.
-Wow. You're cooking, bro.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.393
[woman] You know, when
I saw that sketch I was like,

20:28.460 --> 20:29.394
"Oh, my God.

20:29.461 --> 20:30.929
-This is gonna be awesome."
-Oh, yeah?

20:31.430 --> 20:32.331
Yeah.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.133
It's the type of effect
I want to make.

20:35.200 --> 20:39.304
{\an8}My goal today is definitely
to outperform Scott and Matti.

20:39.371 --> 20:40.539
Yeah, boy.

20:40.606 --> 20:42.107
[Halo] <i> Now, when the</i>
<i>competition's getting tough,</i>

20:42.174 --> 20:45.477
that's when I plan on shining.
I'm gonna stomp this tattoo.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.414
{\an8}-Thanks, man.
-Four hours left.

20:50.015 --> 20:51.650
[needle buzzing]

20:56.655 --> 20:58.757
-You okay?
-I'm good.

20:58.824 --> 21:02.427
$100,000 tattoo right here.
Hell, yeah!

21:03.695 --> 21:05.230
[needle buzzing]

21:05.297 --> 21:09.334
Ow.
[bleep]!

21:09.401 --> 21:12.237
{\an8}My canvas is cranky.
She can't sit worth [bleep].

21:12.304 --> 21:13.972
Is there any way
to not rub it so hard?

21:14.039 --> 21:17.242
I'll try to just, uh,
do it very minimally, okay?

21:17.309 --> 21:19.745
She cannot take the pain.
She's kind of a puss.

21:19.811 --> 21:22.214
[bleep]!
[woman sighs]

21:22.280 --> 21:24.216
[bleeps]!

21:24.282 --> 21:25.517
[Melissa] <i> I'm worried that my</i>
<i>canvas is gonna tap out</i>

21:25.584 --> 21:29.221
and I'm not even gonna get to
finish this stupid tattoo.

21:29.287 --> 21:30.455
[bleep]!

21:30.522 --> 21:32.791
[woman] I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.359
Until it's finished, right?

21:36.595 --> 21:38.964
Big Jim.
What's going on in here?

21:39.031 --> 21:40.432
-[Jim] Playing with colors.
-[Freddy] What color are

21:40.499 --> 21:41.900
the roses gonna be?

21:41.967 --> 21:46.271
{\an8}My big secret is
I'm partly color-blind.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.173
<i>I haven't told anybody else</i>
<i>in the house,</i>

21:48.240 --> 21:49.908
<i>but I'm partly color-blind.</i>

21:49.975 --> 21:53.178
I'm gonna go with warm,
brighter.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.681
[Oliver] <i> The fact that</i>
<i>Jim is tattooing yellow</i>

21:55.747 --> 21:57.082
<i>and the lightest colors</i>

21:57.149 --> 21:59.785
<i>over some of the darkest areas</i>
<i>of the tattoo he's covering,</i>

21:59.851 --> 22:01.453
just really bad decisions.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.622
You guys done
making me nervous now?

22:03.689 --> 22:04.923
You can leave.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.392
We are in the final hour.

22:07.459 --> 22:09.194
[needles buzzing]

22:09.261 --> 22:10.195
I think you set the bar
pretty high.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.731
This might be
my favorite tattoo.

22:12.798 --> 22:14.066
That's what I was going for.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.501
-You doing all right?
-Mm-hmm.

22:16.568 --> 22:19.071
[Kyle] <i> I really love my tattoo.</i>
<i>I think it looks great.</i>

22:19.137 --> 22:21.840
{\an8}I think it fits her leg
very well.

22:21.907 --> 22:24.910
I love it.
It hurts so bad, but I love it.

22:24.976 --> 22:27.512
I really want to prove
that I belong in the top.

22:30.682 --> 22:35.487

No more ink.

[woman exhales]

22:45.864 --> 22:47.165
You wanna see it?

22:48.066 --> 22:50.769
Wow.
That's badass, dude.

22:50.836 --> 22:53.705
-Oh, my God.
-[Halo] Badass or what?

22:53.772 --> 22:55.307
That is awesome.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.913
[Jim] <i> Gentle Jay's tattoo sucks.</i>
<i>The design is crap.</i>

23:01.980 --> 23:02.981
The skull is crap.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.316
I knew I was coming
to get a tattoo today,

23:04.382 --> 23:06.918
but I didn't think I was gonna
get anything close to this.

23:06.985 --> 23:09.621
Once you go that dark,
it's always gonna be

23:09.688 --> 23:11.556
a big mass of dark [bleep].

23:11.623 --> 23:12.758
You sat great, man.

23:12.824 --> 23:14.259
This dude should be
going home.

{\an8}[bleep] them pieces of [bleep]
with their opinions.

23:18.263 --> 23:19.865
{\an8}Don't tattoo for the judges!

23:19.931 --> 23:22.300
You cannot tell me
about a [bleep] canvas.

23:22.367 --> 23:23.902
I cannot stand this tattoo.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.771
You are completely insane.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.341
[dramatic music]

23:33.178 --> 23:34.846
[bleep] tight, dude.
Double-eliminating people

23:34.913 --> 23:37.249
left and right.
Now you cannot

23:37.315 --> 23:38.583
[bleep] up at all.

23:38.650 --> 23:40.218
Speeding [bleep] up, man.
I like it.

23:40.285 --> 23:41.486
-[Jim] Yeah, no [bleep].
-[Halo] What's up, man?

23:41.553 --> 23:43.755
-How you doing?
-Good, man.

23:43.822 --> 23:44.856
I had fun doing that tattoo.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.393
This is a huge piece
for six hours too.

23:48.460 --> 23:49.928
-It looked nice.
-Yeah, dude.

23:49.995 --> 23:50.996
-It looked good?
-[bleep], yeah.

23:51.062 --> 23:52.831
It was fun.
I love that tattoo,

23:52.898 --> 23:55.000
but I'm sure they're still gonna
be able to pick something apart.

23:55.066 --> 23:56.835
No, that thing
was just pretty awesome.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.871
But these judges have
beat me down, especially Núñez.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.940
I haven't impressed him once.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.708
I've had over 20 bad critiques,

24:03.775 --> 24:05.977
and there's
a double elimination,

24:06.044 --> 24:09.181
so that's, to me, like,
I'm going down.

24:09.247 --> 24:10.682
I'm numb from it
at this point.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.217
It's hard to say
you're in the game

24:12.284 --> 24:14.753
when you know
there's no winning for you.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.789
{\an8}I don't know what the [bleep]
is going on with Kyle.

24:17.856 --> 24:20.826
<i>He's full of conspiracy</i>
<i>theories and paranoia.</i>

24:20.892 --> 24:23.829
[Kyle] I'm lost as to what
I think, actually.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.764
I got them figured out.

24:25.831 --> 24:27.465
[Halo] <i> If Kyle doesn't</i>
<i>get these judges</i>

24:27.532 --> 24:28.567
<i>the hell out of his head,</i>

24:28.633 --> 24:31.336
{\an8}Kyle's gonna lose
his [bleep] mind in here.

24:34.773 --> 24:36.341
[rock music]

24:40.846 --> 24:43.882
[dramatic music]

24:47.185 --> 24:49.387
[Dave] Today, you had to show
adaptability

24:49.454 --> 24:52.524
by transforming tattoos
that your canvases regret

24:52.591 --> 24:54.793
into tattoos
they can wear proudly.

24:54.860 --> 24:58.597
Based on your work, two artists
will be closing shop.

24:59.865 --> 25:02.534
Jim, let's start with you.

25:02.601 --> 25:05.237
Doing these roses with all
these yellow highlights in there

25:05.303 --> 25:07.939
and using that yellow
as part of your cover-up,

25:08.006 --> 25:09.341
that is gonna show through.

25:09.407 --> 25:10.809
Would you rather me done
black roses?

25:10.876 --> 25:13.144
Come on, dude,
if this came into your shop,

25:13.211 --> 25:14.212
what the [bleep]
would you have done?

25:14.279 --> 25:15.780
-Not roses.
-I definitely

25:15.847 --> 25:17.549
wouldn't have used yellow
over the top of the old

25:17.616 --> 25:19.551
black line cover-up.
You know better.

25:19.618 --> 25:21.419
For a cover-up, it's a fail.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.390
King Ruck.

25:25.457 --> 25:27.692
[Oliver] This was a failed
attempt from the design alone.

25:27.759 --> 25:30.629
To think that you're gonna put
two gold horseshoes

25:30.695 --> 25:34.466
over the top of the darkest part
of the tattoo, it's insane.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.368
She wanted the horseshoes
obviously on the top.

25:36.434 --> 25:37.769
-I mean, how would you--
-There's a bunch

25:37.836 --> 25:39.437
of different ways
you could approach that.

25:39.504 --> 25:42.040
A nice black-and-blue rose
could have been the cover-up.

25:42.107 --> 25:44.609
The horseshoes could have been
behind it and banners under it.

25:44.676 --> 25:45.844
I've had some bum canvases.

25:45.911 --> 25:48.914
There's 60-plus years of
tattooing sitting at this table.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.182
You cannot tell me
about a [bleep] canvas.

25:51.249 --> 25:52.417
This is not
a terrible canvas.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.386
This simple, bold,
traditional tattoo,

25:54.452 --> 25:56.988
anybody should have
been able to just knock it

25:57.055 --> 25:58.790
out of the goddamn park.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.595
Matti.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.197
You got the other drunken lion.

26:06.264 --> 26:07.666
Yeah, I actually
told Ruck if we could just

26:07.732 --> 26:10.335
get those two back together,
it'd save us some trouble.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.403
That's for sure.

26:11.469 --> 26:14.105
As far as adaptability goes,
very good job

26:14.172 --> 26:15.640
designing the portion
of this tattoo

26:15.707 --> 26:18.043
that goes over the cover-up.
When you look at this tattoo,

26:18.109 --> 26:21.079
your eye is immediately drawn
to that one big, blue

26:21.146 --> 26:22.314
center flower.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.616
You don't just concentrate
on that big, heavy black.

26:24.683 --> 26:25.784
[Freddy] But the cross
is curved.

26:25.850 --> 26:28.586
If it wasn't for that,
I'd love this tattoo.

26:28.653 --> 26:31.823
Straight lines on round objects
are always gonna be tricky.

26:31.890 --> 26:34.059
If you're gonna try to pull 'em
off, they got to be dead-on.

26:36.394 --> 26:37.629
Halo.

26:39.130 --> 26:41.333
[Oliver] As far as the cover-up
goes, you had it easy,

26:41.399 --> 26:43.535
but this tattoo has
such solid saturation

26:43.601 --> 26:46.037
over a big area of skin and
whether it's a cover-up or not,

26:46.104 --> 26:47.505
this is a great tattoo.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.708
You did a great job
applying this.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.910
This is soft tissue
that can get overworked.

26:51.977 --> 26:54.012
It can look beat-up.
Yours looks healed.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.516
Sausage.

27:00.251 --> 27:02.253
[Freddy] The nose, the lips,
spot-on.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.556
I like the use of the black
in the veil.

27:04.622 --> 27:06.691
I think that's what gives it
a painterly look.

27:06.758 --> 27:07.859
Well done.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.661
I don't see what he sees.
I see that you put it

27:09.728 --> 27:11.096
everywhere but the place
where it takes

27:11.162 --> 27:13.431
the most balls to put it,
and that's in the face.

27:13.498 --> 27:15.934
The front hand,
you went really heavy black.

27:16.001 --> 27:17.769
If you're gonna do it
in the hand, do it everywhere.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.504
This tattoo,
I'm not a fan of it.

27:22.807 --> 27:23.842
Scott.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.346
[Freddy] It was one of the
bigger tattoos to cover up.

27:28.413 --> 27:29.748
I think you approached
it the right way

27:29.814 --> 27:32.650
with the hot tones
away from where the cover-up is.

27:32.717 --> 27:33.885
If I looked at this tattoo,

27:33.952 --> 27:35.220
I wouldn't even think
it was a cover-up.

27:35.286 --> 27:36.454
[Chris] People can
shake their heads

27:36.521 --> 27:37.789
or do whatever they want
behind you,

27:37.856 --> 27:40.091
but the tattoo's damn good,
and a lot of people that are

27:40.158 --> 27:41.192
shaking their heads aren't.

27:44.562 --> 27:45.797
Gentle Jay.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.334
I'm most confused
over the hat.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.169
It just screams cover-up.

27:51.236 --> 27:52.704
There's so much room
in that hat

27:52.771 --> 27:54.139
that you could have
left highlights in.

27:54.205 --> 27:56.641
My biggest problem is
the areas that are overworked.

27:56.708 --> 27:59.044
The outline
in the socket of the nose.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.046
If any of that's overworked,
that's the first time

28:01.112 --> 28:02.580
you've seen it out of me.

28:02.647 --> 28:03.648
I don't normally do that.

28:03.715 --> 28:05.016
It may not be
what you normally do,

28:05.083 --> 28:07.819
but in this competition,
it could be what sends you home.

28:10.855 --> 28:11.890
Lydia.

28:13.758 --> 28:16.528
[Oliver] You did show very good
skills in adaptability

28:16.594 --> 28:18.596
to working
with the existing tattoo.

28:18.663 --> 28:20.598
I think it's very creative.
I liked it.

28:20.665 --> 28:23.802
It's not your standard,
big top hat cover-up.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.236
You show
some really smooth shading.

28:25.303 --> 28:27.806
I would like to see a lot richer
black in the eye sockets

28:27.872 --> 28:29.841
because that really rich black
will make

28:29.908 --> 28:31.743
that nice, powdery shading
look better.

28:35.313 --> 28:36.548
Melissa.

28:38.516 --> 28:40.218
-How you feeling, Melissa?
-Terrible.

28:40.285 --> 28:43.621
I tried really hard, but she was
very difficult to work with.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.557
It's still your job
to do a nice, clean tattoo,

28:45.623 --> 28:47.926
and a lot of these lines
are not perfect.

28:47.992 --> 28:49.561
A lot of the shading
is not smooth.

28:49.627 --> 28:51.663
If it's an engine,
it's all got to fit together,

28:51.729 --> 28:53.398
and if parts
don't fit together well,

28:53.465 --> 28:54.799
then parts don't work well.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.568
She specifically
wanted new school.

28:56.634 --> 28:58.536
She specifically wanted
the bubbliness.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.605
[Chris] You do not
let the client drive.

29:00.672 --> 29:02.040
The second you give up
that seat,

29:02.107 --> 29:04.542
you give up your shot
at winning 100 grand.

29:07.912 --> 29:08.947
Kyle.

29:10.381 --> 29:11.883
You are completely insane.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.519
This girl had a tattoo
this big, and now

29:14.586 --> 29:19.357
she has a crazy-shaped design
that's very awkward.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.326
I wanted to accentuate
her hips

29:21.392 --> 29:22.894
and show some shape
to her thigh.

29:22.961 --> 29:26.898
If she was just wearing shorts,
she has a huge, brown,

29:26.965 --> 29:30.268
gray, blue blob hanging out
the bottom of her shorts.

29:30.335 --> 29:32.403
Kyle, I'm really confused
by this tattoo as well.

29:32.470 --> 29:36.975
It's a trunk with no branches
and way too little flowers.

29:37.041 --> 29:40.011
You're not a versatile artist.
You are a pigeonholed artist.

29:40.078 --> 29:42.947
Cherry blossoms budded
right up to a trunk.

29:43.014 --> 29:44.082
It's not real.

29:44.149 --> 29:45.250
[Kyle] Whether or not I made
the right choices,

29:45.316 --> 29:46.551
I like the tattoo.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.086
If you want to do this stuff
and you want to experiment,

29:48.153 --> 29:49.287
don't do it here.

29:49.354 --> 29:50.922
I cannot stand this tattoo.

29:54.392 --> 29:55.627
Wow.

29:57.762 --> 29:59.597
[Dave] Before we send you
back to the loft,

29:59.664 --> 30:01.266
the judges have determined
a winner.

30:02.901 --> 30:03.935
Scott...

30:05.436 --> 30:07.205
...and Halo...

30:07.272 --> 30:10.175
...you have the top-two tattoos
of the day.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.977
The judges have decided
the best tattoo of the day...

30:14.746 --> 30:16.314
...goes to Halo.

30:16.381 --> 30:17.682
[Sausage] Good job.

30:20.218 --> 30:22.120
[Chris] Halo, the saturation
you used in this tattoo,

30:22.187 --> 30:25.423
the way you pulled off the solid
fields of blue, very nice.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.925
You did a great job.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.059
[Dave] Congratulations, Halo.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.928
You now have the power
to choose the artist

30:29.994 --> 30:34.232
you think has the worst tattoo
and put them up for elimination.

30:34.299 --> 30:36.868
The human canvas jury is also
deliberating right now.

30:36.935 --> 30:40.538
Their vote will put another
artist up for elimination.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.540
Head back to the loft
and we'll call you

30:42.607 --> 30:44.175
when we have a decision.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.044
[rock music]

30:50.682 --> 30:52.584
I am tattooing
for these [bleep] judges,

30:52.650 --> 30:53.952
and I'm done with it
as of today.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.154
-Don't tattoo for the judges!
-Obviously, I'm tattooing

30:56.221 --> 30:58.489
for those mother[bleep],
and my work has gotten

30:58.556 --> 30:59.891
so much worse.

30:59.958 --> 31:02.594
[bleep] them pieces of [bleep]
with their opinions.

31:02.660 --> 31:04.329
You still got to be Kyle,
though.

31:04.395 --> 31:05.530
-Let me finish--
-Explain to me now

31:05.597 --> 31:06.531
how the [bleep] that goes down.
-Who gives a [bleep]

31:06.598 --> 31:08.066
about what the judges want?

31:08.132 --> 31:12.036
You finished top four
last season doing Kyle work.

31:12.103 --> 31:13.238
Not true.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.807
I finished top four last season
changing everything

31:15.873 --> 31:17.642
that was about me
until I didn't know

31:17.709 --> 31:19.110
who the [bleep] I was
and still don't,

31:19.177 --> 31:21.946
and now I'm at a level of I
don't even feel like an artist.

31:22.013 --> 31:23.982
Oh, my [bleep] God.
I don't understand what--

31:24.048 --> 31:25.817
how do I make these
more perfect?

31:25.883 --> 31:27.885
I tried to do everything, every
hoop that you put me through.

31:27.952 --> 31:29.187
Don't try to please 'em!

31:30.888 --> 31:32.190
No, no, when I don't try
and please 'em,

31:32.257 --> 31:34.092
they point out everything
that's wrong about you,

31:34.158 --> 31:35.927
and then they bring it
to a personal level.

31:40.498 --> 31:41.699
I know.

31:41.766 --> 31:42.867
I hate to send you down, dude,

31:42.934 --> 31:44.202
but I think you're probably
going on the bottom

31:44.269 --> 31:45.803
{\an8}regardless of what I do.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.942
-Terrible tattoo.
-Mm-hmm.

31:51.009 --> 31:53.411
[Halo] But Jay fit the cover-up
and you didn't.

31:53.478 --> 31:55.513
He didn't meet the challenge
and, unfortunately,

31:55.580 --> 31:58.049
if I didn't aim at him now,
I'd have to aim at him later.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.454
I'm gonna let the cat
out of the bag.

32:03.521 --> 32:05.089
I'm partly color-blind.

32:06.391 --> 32:09.394
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm dead [bleep] serious, dude.

32:11.296 --> 32:12.330
I had no idea, dude.

32:18.403 --> 32:20.271
[rock music]

32:24.542 --> 32:25.943
All right,
so adaptability.

32:26.010 --> 32:29.347
We did a cover-up today.
Two people are going home.

32:29.414 --> 32:31.916
There was talk about putting
King Ruck in the bottom.

32:31.983 --> 32:33.217
[Chris] You have
an upside-down rose,

32:33.284 --> 32:35.920
it's tucked into a black abyss.

32:35.987 --> 32:37.155
And then no black
anywhere else.

32:37.221 --> 32:38.890
-Yeah, that screams cover-up.
-Terrible.

32:38.956 --> 32:40.325
[Dave] We had Jim.

32:40.391 --> 32:42.260
[Chris] You can see "Marko"
right through this tattoo.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.062
[Oliver] Why is there
so much yellow?

32:44.128 --> 32:45.263
[Dave] Over black lettering?

32:45.330 --> 32:46.898
Just the design alone,
it had no chance

32:46.964 --> 32:48.366
to make a good cover-up.

32:48.433 --> 32:49.400
[Dave] Melissa.

32:49.467 --> 32:50.735
[Oliver] A lot of things
are out of whack.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.838
The details of the outlines
are so wonky and out of shape.

32:53.905 --> 32:55.540
-[Dave] Gentle Jay.
-[Oliver] A mess.

32:55.606 --> 32:57.141
There's no highlight anywhere.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.043
[Chris] The smoke is terrible.
The eyes are terrible.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.511
Forget about the way
he shaded the hat.

33:00.578 --> 33:03.081
[Oliver] I'm ready for this
competition to get more tight.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.515
-I'm ready for it to be a fight.
-[Dave] Yeah.

33:04.582 --> 33:06.851
It's gonna be interesting to see
who the human canvas jury

33:06.918 --> 33:08.386
votes, that's for sure.

33:09.587 --> 33:12.457
{\an8}We're here to determine
the worst tattoo of the day.

33:12.523 --> 33:15.259
That's my tattoo.
Melissa was my artist.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.829
I asked for a V-twin engine.

33:17.895 --> 33:19.564
[man] Where the pushrods go,
one's crooked.

33:19.630 --> 33:22.100
The fins on the cylinder,
one is this long,

33:22.166 --> 33:23.134
one is this long.

33:23.201 --> 33:24.469
[woman] I'm really upset.

33:24.535 --> 33:28.005
I now have to have something
that does not exist in reality

33:28.072 --> 33:29.540
on my body
for the rest of my life.

33:29.607 --> 33:30.541
[man] I heard you.

33:30.608 --> 33:31.876
You are basically
a nightmare client.

33:31.943 --> 33:33.544
I was in so much
horrific pain.

33:33.611 --> 33:35.313
She's got to get some credit
for covering it.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.150
That's my tattoo
and Jim is my artist.

33:39.217 --> 33:40.852
[man] Can you guys see
the old tattoo?

33:40.918 --> 33:42.620
[woman] Yes.
What is that insect?

33:42.687 --> 33:45.957
It looks like a praying mantis
with butterfly wings.

33:46.023 --> 33:47.191
The nine legs
are killing me.

33:47.258 --> 33:48.793
I would be pissed with that.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.194
[woman] To me, it is phenomenal.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.230
I mean, I cried
when I first saw it.

33:52.296 --> 33:54.699
That is my tattoo.
My artist was King Ruck.

33:54.766 --> 33:57.201
[man] I know that tattoo
'cause I had it before too.

33:57.268 --> 33:58.503
You still see the lines.

33:58.569 --> 34:00.538
Look in the horseshoes,
the lines are still there.

34:00.605 --> 34:01.839
[man] Yeah, you can still see
the lines.

34:01.906 --> 34:03.007
[woman] I'm not pleased at all.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.209
The horseshoes, to me,
look like cartoon magnets.

34:05.276 --> 34:06.677
The rose is pointed way down.

34:06.744 --> 34:08.746
[man] Not to really piss you
off, but I'm going to.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.447
That tattoo sucks.

34:10.514 --> 34:12.583
He didn't even listen
to what-- anything I said.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.886
-Yeah, that sucks.
-Guys, do we have a decision?

34:14.952 --> 34:16.053
-[woman] Yes.
-Definitely.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.388
[woman] Without a doubt.

34:18.456 --> 34:19.489
[door closes]

34:21.926 --> 34:24.195
All right, Halo.
Who are you sending down?

34:27.965 --> 34:29.199
Gonna be Jim.

34:30.467 --> 34:33.137
All right.
Halo, we'll see you, Jim...

34:34.739 --> 34:38.509
...Melissa, Jay,
King Ruck.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.346
See y'all in the shop.

34:51.088 --> 34:53.724
Kyle, you look like
you're about to snap.

34:53.791 --> 34:56.027
Were you thinking you were
gonna go down there today?

34:56.092 --> 34:57.328
I don't know.

34:57.395 --> 34:59.263
I actually thought
you would be in the top three.

34:59.330 --> 35:03.167
I think they just love giving
you [bleep] critiques, dude.

35:03.234 --> 35:05.002
I had high hopes
of at least being mentioned

35:05.069 --> 35:07.171
as a good tattoo,
or even just ending up

35:07.238 --> 35:08.706
with a positive critique.

35:11.542 --> 35:13.444
[dramatic music]

35:18.683 --> 35:19.784
Whew...

35:19.851 --> 35:22.019
Today, we tested
your adaptability

35:22.086 --> 35:24.155
with a cover-up tattoo.

35:24.222 --> 35:27.558
Based on your work, two artists
will be closing shop.

35:31.429 --> 35:35.733
Jim, you're here because Halo
put you up for elimination.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.468
Halo,
why did you choose Jim?

35:37.535 --> 35:39.837
Jim's didn't really do
a cover-up,

35:39.904 --> 35:41.339
and I kind of figured
Melissa and Ruck

35:41.405 --> 35:42.673
were gonna be
on the bottom anyway.

35:42.740 --> 35:45.476
I didn't want my count
to be useless, you know?

35:45.543 --> 35:46.677
A shell without a bullet,
I guess.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.379
[Oliver] I can't really disagree
with Halo.

35:48.446 --> 35:50.915
What we're looking for today,
cover-up, you didn't do it.

35:50.982 --> 35:51.916
[Jim] Judge me off my history.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.585
All I ever do
is just clean work.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.555
[Dave] King Ruck, you're here
because the human canvas jury

35:57.622 --> 36:00.858
determined that you had
the worst tattoo of the day.

36:00.925 --> 36:01.926
[King Ruck] I know what I did.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.461
Of course it's not
my best tattoo,

36:03.528 --> 36:05.596
but I know that I'm
a good tattoo artist.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.632
[Freddy] I think it says a lot
that the judges

36:07.698 --> 36:08.733
and the canvases agreed.

36:08.799 --> 36:10.701
You did definitely
drop the ball on this one.

36:11.702 --> 36:12.670
[Dave] Melissa.

36:12.737 --> 36:15.106
I definitely had a rough time
altogether

36:15.172 --> 36:16.607
and I shouldn't have
let her take the wheel.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.543
You need to be driving
the whole time.

36:18.609 --> 36:19.744
She was a [bleep].

36:19.810 --> 36:22.346
Straight lines don't depend
on bitchiness or not.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.317
[Dave] Jay.

36:26.384 --> 36:27.552
[Oliver] I can
look at this outline

36:27.618 --> 36:29.887
and look at some of the shading
and call you out on it.

36:29.954 --> 36:31.122
[Jay] If you look
at my portfolio,

36:31.188 --> 36:32.323
you can see the work on there.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.491
It speaks for itself.

36:33.558 --> 36:35.693
What have you done
that's competed against the top?

36:35.760 --> 36:39.130
Actually, the first piece
we did, that skull was badass.

36:39.196 --> 36:41.098
-No.
-Come on.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.199
[Chris] No, come on.

36:42.266 --> 36:43.935
It wasn't a top-four tattoo
that day.

36:44.001 --> 36:45.536
You're still cruising
in the middle.

36:47.338 --> 36:52.810
Jim, King Ruck,
Jay, and Melissa.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.479
Any one of you could
justifiably be eliminated.

36:57.181 --> 36:58.416
The judges have decided.

37:03.387 --> 37:07.124
King Ruck, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

37:07.191 --> 37:08.993
What you gave us
is what we judge.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.363
This tattoo was a fail.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.265
[Dave] The judges have
also decided...

37:17.802 --> 37:21.439
...Jim, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.207
This tattoo,
it's see-through,

37:23.274 --> 37:25.543
and for a cover-up,
that's a no-go.

37:25.610 --> 37:28.846
Both of you, please pack
your machines and close shop.

37:31.515 --> 37:33.284
[Chris] There was a lot of
tattoos that were done today

37:33.351 --> 37:35.820
that were not good.

37:35.886 --> 37:38.456
Tell Kyle Dunbar that he should
have been down here...

37:40.124 --> 37:41.826
...and he could have
justifiably left.

37:43.628 --> 37:45.630
Three of you can head back
to the loft.

37:45.696 --> 37:47.331
[rock music]

37:48.532 --> 37:49.800
[King Ruck] <i> I don't believe in</i>
<i>excuses.</i>

37:49.867 --> 37:51.235
<i>That's how I get down.</i>

37:51.302 --> 37:52.737
I'm not a [bleep] wimp.

37:52.803 --> 37:53.704
<i>I dropped the ball.</i>

37:53.771 --> 37:57.375
It sucks,
but I stand by my mistake.

37:57.441 --> 38:00.177
Halo brought me down
because I'm a future threat.

38:00.244 --> 38:02.146
<i>If there was</i>
<i>a black-and-gray challenge,</i>

38:02.213 --> 38:03.214
<i>I would have smoked him.</i>

38:03.280 --> 38:04.315
But you know what,
dude?

38:04.382 --> 38:05.616
Game well played.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.724
[announcer] <i> On the next episode</i>
<i>of</i> Ink Master...

38:13.791 --> 38:16.327
Núñez made a specific point
of saying,

38:16.394 --> 38:18.896
"Kyle Dunbar
should have been down here."

38:18.963 --> 38:20.831
He's gonna try and call me out
on this [bleep]?

38:20.898 --> 38:23.034
Like, what the [bleep] wrong
with that [bleep]?

38:23.934 --> 38:25.936
-Whoo-hoo!
-Oh...

38:26.003 --> 38:28.239
Let me make it clear.
This is going on my body.

38:28.305 --> 38:31.075
I do not care
if you go home.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.244
I have been nice
as [bleep] to you.

38:33.310 --> 38:35.312
-The point wasn't to screw you.
-Bull[bleep].

38:35.379 --> 38:37.014
This looks like a kid
in high school drew it.

38:37.081 --> 38:39.283
-What?
-It's just not there.

38:39.350 --> 38:40.718
[bleep] you, dude.
You little bitch.

38:40.785 --> 38:41.986
Well, listen, mother[bleep],
whatever you--

38:42.053 --> 38:43.788
Mother[bleep]?

38:43.854 --> 38:45.556
[Melissa] Kyle?
-[Dave] Kyle, slow down, bro.

38:45.623 --> 38:48.125
Get the [bleep] off me!
You're walking up on me?

38:48.192 --> 38:49.727
Yeah, I'm walking up on you!

38:52.363 --> 38:55.566
[rock music]

39:23.427 --> 39:24.662
{\an8}[man] Original.
