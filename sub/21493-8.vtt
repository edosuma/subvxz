00:06.005 --> 00:07.215
[Sam]  Julia.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.509
Julia, Julia.

00:10.301 --> 00:11.469
Julia.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.180
Julia.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.599
Julia.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.184
[chattering]

00:19.227 --> 00:20.061
Julia.

00:20.812 --> 00:21.771
Julia.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.816
Julia, Julia, Julia, Julia.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.193
Julia.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.362
Julia, Julia...

00:29.446 --> 00:30.280
Julia!

00:33.491 --> 00:34.492
What's that, now?

00:36.453 --> 00:39.456
It's okay. He blurts things out sometimes.
It's normal.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.708
Is everything okay, Sam?

00:42.500 --> 00:44.335
Paige, I'm sorry to inform you of this,

00:44.419 --> 00:46.921
but I shouldn't be here
because I don't love you.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.592
What?

00:50.675 --> 00:52.010
I don't love you.

00:53.178 --> 00:57.223
I thought I did because you passed
a simple checklist test that I devised,

00:57.307 --> 01:00.060
but it turns out
the simpler test was just knowing,

01:00.143 --> 01:03.396
and you failed that one.
So I think we should break up.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.985
It was nice to meet all of you.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.823
Oh, and by the way, they actually do have
plain pasta with butter,

01:13.907 --> 01:17.452
even though it's not on the menu,
in case you're not happy with your order.

01:17.535 --> 01:18.745
It's delicious.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.538
See you at school, Paige.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.339
Those buttered noodles
do sound pretty good.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.341
Shh! Quiet!

01:32.634 --> 01:33.968
[sniffles]

01:46.648 --> 01:49.067
[Sam]  I've learned a lot
about love this year.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.989
[cell phone buzzing]

01:56.950 --> 01:58.785
It can be very complicated.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.164
[knocking on door]

02:04.249 --> 02:05.667
Hey, sleepyhead.

02:05.750 --> 02:09.420
There she is. I was thinking we should
celebrate you getting into Clayton.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.464
Maybe go out to breakfast,
just the two of us.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.091
Or lunch?

02:20.765 --> 02:22.058
Sam?

02:22.142 --> 02:24.811
What are you doing here?
We don't have an appointment.

02:25.478 --> 02:28.189
I know.
But I wanted to tell you something,

02:28.273 --> 02:29.899
and I wanted to do it in person

02:29.983 --> 02:32.277
because this message involves a gift.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.028
Okay.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.239
Julia...

02:37.323 --> 02:40.827
I've wanted you to be my girlfriend
since the day that I gave you my brain.

02:40.910 --> 02:43.454
But then I learned
that you have a boyfriend

02:43.538 --> 02:46.040
and about something called
a conflict of interest.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.001
So on my father's suggestion,

02:48.084 --> 02:50.169
I got a practice girlfriend named Paige

02:50.253 --> 02:52.755
to prepare for the day
when you and I could be together.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.173
Okay, Sam, no.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.925
And now I believe that I'm ready.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.720
I know how to dance and go to the mall

02:58.803 --> 03:02.056
and that it's inappropriate
to lock a woman in your closet.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.893
And I've seen boobs... really nice ones.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.185
It was so cool.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.230
Okay, but you have to understand that--

03:09.314 --> 03:10.523
So I got you this.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.117
Chocolate-covered strawberries?

03:25.288 --> 03:26.331
Sam...

03:27.081 --> 03:30.335
did you break into my house
with chocolate-covered strawberries?

03:30.418 --> 03:32.670
No. Uh, the window was open.

03:32.754 --> 03:36.633
I just silently climbed in
until my dad made me leave.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.968
Well, you dropped one.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.512
Really?

03:42.472 --> 03:43.806
Oh.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.476
You need to leave, Sam.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.186
Now.

03:50.855 --> 03:55.443
Zahid says that you just know
when you love someone, which is dumb

03:55.526 --> 03:58.404
because it's not based
on data or research.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.449
But when we were dancing
in the parking garage,

04:01.532 --> 04:02.825
I just knew.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.494
Didn't you?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.997
Are you asking me
if I want to start a romantic relationship

04:08.081 --> 04:09.374
with my teenage patient?

04:09.457 --> 04:10.875
Yes. Exactly.

04:12.627 --> 04:13.920
Okay, fine.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.964
Say I agree to be your girlfriend.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.925
Then what? We start dating, have sex?

04:19.008 --> 04:21.135
I'd lose my job
for sleeping with a patient,

04:21.219 --> 04:23.680
so I won't have any money
to pay my bills or my rent,

04:23.763 --> 04:26.474
and I have $200,000 in student loans.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.476
Do you have an
extra $200,000 lying around?

04:28.559 --> 04:29.852
No. Uh...

04:30.353 --> 04:32.230
I don't know.
You're talking really fast.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.606
Because I'm upset!

04:33.690 --> 04:36.401
What you did is very inappropriate.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.070
You have no sense of that,
after all the work we put in?

04:39.737 --> 04:42.490
So... you don't love me?

04:42.573 --> 04:44.784
No. Oh, my God, no!

04:44.867 --> 04:45.702
No!

04:46.369 --> 04:47.704
God, no!

04:47.787 --> 04:48.830
No!

04:48.913 --> 04:49.914
No!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.085
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.337
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.464
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.092
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.011
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.679
-Uh...
-Adélie, chinstrap...

05:04.762 --> 05:06.723
I didn't mean to upset you.
I wanted to...

05:06.806 --> 05:10.893
-You have to understand...
-Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.186
Sam, I'm so sorry!

05:12.270 --> 05:16.399
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.568
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.862
-[horn honks]
-Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.699
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.410
-Sam?
-Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.704
-Is everything okay?
-Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:29.787 --> 05:33.916
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:34.876 --> 05:35.877
[bracelet jangles]

05:36.627 --> 05:40.798
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:40.882 --> 05:44.510
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:44.594 --> 05:48.431
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.768
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo!
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo!

05:51.851 --> 05:55.480
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo!
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo!

05:55.563 --> 05:57.940
-Hey!
-Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo!

05:58.024 --> 05:59.901
Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo!

05:59.984 --> 06:01.903
[groaning]

06:06.115 --> 06:07.366
Oh, thank God.

06:07.450 --> 06:10.244
-He's up front.
-Okay.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.454
[Doug] What happened?

06:11.537 --> 06:12.914
I'm sorry. You know...

06:12.997 --> 06:14.624
[Sam groaning]

06:14.707 --> 06:17.168
[Elsa shushing]

06:17.251 --> 06:18.461
Okay.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.758
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.760
I always try to drive extra smooth

06:25.843 --> 06:27.553
when Sam's on the bus.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.056
So his back doesn't touch the seat.
I did that.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.724
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.435
I appreciate that you were there
and appreciate you gave us a call.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.604
You're welcome.
Is there anything I can do?

06:36.687 --> 06:38.106
-No.
-Should I call someone?

06:38.189 --> 06:40.358
No, no, no, she's got it. Thank you.

06:40.441 --> 06:43.236
[Elsa shushing]

06:43.319 --> 06:46.030
[continues shushing]

06:46.114 --> 06:50.660
[Sam]  You probably wouldn't expect this,
but Antarctica has 37 named volcanoes,

06:50.743 --> 06:53.538
many of them buried
under thick layers of ice.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.915
Close your eyes.

06:58.543 --> 07:01.129
[Sam]  And yet, often, under all that ice,

07:01.212 --> 07:03.756
the lava creates heated caves.

07:04.340 --> 07:08.136
So, even in this landscape
of relentless cold,

07:08.219 --> 07:10.972
you can find hidden pockets of warmth.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.725
[Elsa] I'm gonna make you
some hot soup, okay?

07:15.685 --> 07:19.730
You warm enough? We can turn up the heat.
You need me to turn up the heat?

07:34.245 --> 07:35.746
-Why would you do that?
-Doug.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.582
-What were you thinking?
-I'm sorry.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.209
Sorry? He let his guard down with you.
He trusted you.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.253
-I'm sorry.
-You know how many people that kid has

07:42.336 --> 07:45.214
in his life that treat him like a person,
and that's what you do?

07:45.298 --> 07:48.593
I'm 27 years old. My life's a mess.
I don't know what I'm doing.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.178
That's a bullshit excuse.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.345
You crushed him.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.474
This isn't all on me.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.435
You knew Sam had a crush on me.
You enabled those feelings.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.520
You helped him break into my home.
That's on you.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.314
I know. I'm an idiot.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.567
That's why I was talking to you.
You're supposed to be an expert.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.611
-Guess what. I don't know anything.
-No shit.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.239
Just stay away from my son.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.202
[knocking on door]

08:15.870 --> 08:16.787
Hey.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.123
Hi.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.875
Uh, sorry to just show up,

08:20.958 --> 08:24.253
but you weren't really responding
to any of my texts,

08:24.337 --> 08:26.964
so I thought I'd go
old-school and just...

08:27.048 --> 08:28.674
track you down in person.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.094
Sorry. Sam had a thing,

08:32.178 --> 08:34.347
so it's just been kind
of hectic around here.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.559
Really seems hectic.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.228
Yeah.

08:41.854 --> 08:42.688
Um...

08:42.772 --> 08:44.232
Is everything cool?

08:45.650 --> 08:46.567
Uh-huh.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.986
Like, is everything cool with us?

08:49.570 --> 08:51.197
Yeah. We're fine.

08:51.280 --> 08:55.117
Okay, because if it's about that
"I love you" thing, I take it back.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.870
I didn't mean it.

08:57.954 --> 09:03.042
I just thought that's what, you know,
girls like to hear after...

09:03.751 --> 09:04.752
you know.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.341
You're such an asshole.
Do you know that?

09:12.218 --> 09:13.719
-Just go home.
-Wait, Casey.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.221
I said get out!

09:24.730 --> 09:27.650
[Sam]  Most people don't give
much thought to snow.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.402
But I do.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.737
-What are you watching?
-Frozen Planet.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.824
It's a seven-part
nature documentary series.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.034
This one is about volcanic ice caves.

09:37.785 --> 09:38.911
Sounds awful.

09:39.704 --> 09:43.708
[Sam]  When it snows, it gets really quiet
because snow actually absorbs sound.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.460
-Can I have some blankets?
-No.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.046
So when you get a snowstorm,

09:49.130 --> 09:51.716
it's like soundproofing
for the entire planet.

09:55.094 --> 09:59.599
Sometimes I wish it would snow
and just never stop snowing.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.660
[muffled rock music playing]

10:19.744 --> 10:21.746
-[chattering]
-[laughing]

10:28.294 --> 10:31.631
What the hell is this?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.929
[laughing] Oh, yeah.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.765
What up, Shorty?

10:42.933 --> 10:45.561
I didn't know they made eyes that blue.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.022
You are too young for me.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.776
Ah, the prettiest lady here.

10:51.859 --> 10:56.155
Okay, Zahid, good. Headphones.
Put them in the garage, please.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.199
But can't I stay here?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.076
No. Shoo!

11:01.702 --> 11:03.037
Enchanté.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.040
[box crunches]

11:08.459 --> 11:11.337
Hey, Case. Want me to do your hair?
I can squeeze you in.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.882
Why are you even doing this? You know
Sam's not going to the dance anymore.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.675
Well, whether he goes or not,

11:16.759 --> 11:18.886
I made a commitment,
and I plan to keep it.

11:19.553 --> 11:22.515
Oh, really? I didn't think
commitments mattered to you.

11:25.101 --> 11:25.935
I'll be right back.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.147
Honey...
I don't know what's going on with you,

11:30.231 --> 11:33.192
if you're stressed about changing schools

11:33.275 --> 11:35.653
or if it's something else,

11:35.736 --> 11:38.155
but you can't keep taking it out on me.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.032
I haven't done anything.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.035
Yeah. You're perfect.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.371
Hey.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.000
I love you very much.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.254
Okay, whatever. I have to go.

11:58.843 --> 12:02.721
Code titties. I repeat, code titties.
There are a thousand hotties downstairs.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.641
They're bored.
Their standards of entertainment are low.

12:05.724 --> 12:06.851
We got to get down there.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.853
No, thank you. I'm okay here.

12:08.936 --> 12:12.148
What's going on, man? Why are you
wrapped up like a skinny burrito?

12:13.649 --> 12:16.902
There was an incident... on the bus.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.779
I caused a scene.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.824
Oh. Dude, I'm sorry.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.285
You know what might make you
feel better, though?

12:24.368 --> 12:27.079
Like a thousand nice asses
in those fleecy sweatpants.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.080
Or nachos.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.083
No, melty cheese
makes my mouth feel funny.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.334
And I'm done with girls.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.669
They're too...

12:36.380 --> 12:38.090
Did something happen with Paige?

12:38.799 --> 12:39.800
Not Paige.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.635
Julia.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.388
All right,
I'm calling bullshit on this Julia.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.265
She dresses like a homeless lady,

12:46.348 --> 12:50.394
and she has horrible taste in televisions.
I thought you were in love with Paige.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.688
I thought so, too, but then...

12:54.940 --> 12:57.985
With Julia, it was like you said.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.237
I just knew.

13:00.321 --> 13:04.575
But then when I-I told her how I felt...

13:09.038 --> 13:11.457
I'm sorry, man. Chicks are the worst.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.126
Now, let's go meet a whole bunch of them.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.005
[Paige] Screw you, Sam Gardner!

13:18.088 --> 13:22.676
Since you thought it would be appropriate
to take a giant dump on my heart,

13:22.760 --> 13:26.555
I thought it would be appropriate
to dump all of your stuff!

13:27.223 --> 13:28.432
Honey!

13:28.516 --> 13:30.017
We got a situation!

13:30.100 --> 13:33.020
Here's the "A" I got on the AP bio test
you helped me study for.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.607
Here's the drawing of the Antarctic krill,

13:36.690 --> 13:39.318
which I obviously don't need
for my locker anymore!

13:40.069 --> 13:43.697
Here's the detention slip that we got
after our first kiss in French class.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.115
[screams]

13:45.199 --> 13:46.450
She seems mad.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.202
Yeah, she is.

13:48.285 --> 13:51.247
But you know what's not in here?
My virginity!

13:52.164 --> 13:54.291
Yeah! Which you were
gonna get, by the way.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.918
But now you're not.

13:56.752 --> 14:00.089
I'll probably do it with the first guy
in college with a British accent.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.840
So thanks for that!

14:02.550 --> 14:04.134
You know what else isn't in there?

14:04.218 --> 14:08.180
The penguin necklace you got me.
I lost it, at some point, last Tuesday,

14:08.264 --> 14:10.349
and I really, really miss it.

14:10.432 --> 14:14.144
And I didn't want to tell you because
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.982
But now I do!

14:20.109 --> 14:22.152
Jeez, dude, what did you do to her?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.822
I don't know. I just told her the truth.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.741
I think you broke her heart, Sam.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.370
[Sam]  People think autistic people
don't have empathy,

14:31.453 --> 14:33.330
but that's not true.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.876
Sometimes I can't tell if someone's upset,

14:36.959 --> 14:40.087
but once I know, I feel lots of empathy.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.632
Maybe even more than neurotypicals.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.219
This was gonna be
your Christmas present, Sam.

14:47.761 --> 14:48.888
Isn't it so cute?

14:48.971 --> 14:51.056
-You would have loved that, dude.
-Yep.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.266
Well, guess what.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.480
-No! Paige!
-[Zahid] Ugh!

14:58.564 --> 14:59.982
Suck on that.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.486
Paige is here?
Does she want her hair done?

15:04.570 --> 15:05.404
I don't think so.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.823
[engine starts]

15:07.907 --> 15:09.783
I think I need to apologize to Paige.

15:09.867 --> 15:10.743
[tires squeal]

15:10.826 --> 15:13.495
It's gonna need
to be a pretty big apology, bro.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.513
I'll have a gin and tonic.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.142
You know there's no way
that's happening, right?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.436
Do you want to see my ID?

15:37.519 --> 15:40.272
Not really. You're clearly not 21.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.107
Trust me, you want to see my ID.

15:52.743 --> 15:53.953
Casey.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.122
Yeah.

16:02.044 --> 16:02.878
Shit.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.632
I'll take that gin and tonic now.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.771
Lime and soda. Best I can do.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.694
I saw you guys... you and my mom.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.239
-Have you talked to her?
-No.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.824
It's over. It ended.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.367
That's bullshit.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.285
No, I'm serious. She ended things with me.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.371
Why?

16:39.915 --> 16:41.583
Because of you...

16:41.667 --> 16:43.002
her family.

16:44.920 --> 16:48.132
If she cared about us, she wouldn't have
done it in the first place.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.511
I don't know about that,
but I don't think it's so simple.

16:52.594 --> 16:55.514
-What the hell do you know?
-Not much, really.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.017
But I know she really loves you two.

16:58.892 --> 17:02.021
Us two? There's three of us?
There's me, my brother and my dad.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.189
I know, I meant three.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.201
Why did she do it?

17:17.786 --> 17:19.580
I-I don't know.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.584
I think your mom has spent...

17:25.127 --> 17:27.838
a really long time
sort of stuck in a role.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.175
I mean, not stuck, uh...

17:31.800 --> 17:34.428
but there's more to her
than just being a mom, you know?

17:35.095 --> 17:37.347
I think she just needed
to be reminded of that,

17:38.223 --> 17:39.975
to remind herself.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.436
Wow.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.356
That is super deep, dude.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.069
[glass shatters]

17:54.907 --> 17:55.949
[Sam]  Okay.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.701
Here's what we're gonna do.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.789
I made Paige feel the way
Julia made me feel...

18:02.372 --> 18:04.124
which is very bad.

18:06.126 --> 18:09.129
So I'm gonna make it up to her
by finding her missing necklace

18:09.213 --> 18:11.381
and presenting it to her
at the silent dance.

18:11.465 --> 18:14.259
Yeah, dude!
You look like a million bucks!

18:14.343 --> 18:18.639
Well, the tux rental was only $99,
so that's a really good return.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.892
I'll trust you on the math.
Now look over here, Double-O Penguin.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.146
Oh, honey, look!

18:27.564 --> 18:30.984
-How does Zahid have your phone number?
-I gave it to him in case of emergencies.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.654
But he uses it to send me selfies
when he's bored.

18:33.737 --> 18:34.696
Look at this guy.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.032
He looks great.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.576
You ever think we'd make it
to a school dance?

18:39.660 --> 18:42.496
Especially after yesterday.
We were good together.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.123
-I know.
-Really, really good.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.250
I know. It was a tough day.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.960
You know what?

18:48.043 --> 18:49.586
-What?
-You were right.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.632
You were right to push him.
You've been great with him lately.

18:53.715 --> 18:58.137
He's been needing you much more than me,
which has been hard for me, but, clearly,

18:58.220 --> 18:59.388
really good for him.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.601
You know, I knew about Julia.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.313
Yeah, we both did.
I mean, he was overly dependent on her.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.900
No, I knew... how he felt about her.

19:11.984 --> 19:16.113
He told me that he had a crush on her,
and I didn't tell you.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.823
And I know I should have.

19:19.283 --> 19:23.162
But, you know, it's always been...
the two of you.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.414
It's always been you and Sam, and...

19:26.415 --> 19:29.126
You know, he started talking to me and...

19:30.586 --> 19:32.296
I didn't want to lose that.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.716
Yeah.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.761
Do you know why it's always
been me and Sam?

19:40.762 --> 19:41.805
Because you left.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.641
But I'm here now,
and I'm not going anywhere.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.268
I know.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.561
But...

19:48.896 --> 19:53.775
imagine having a young child
that was just diagnosed...

19:54.610 --> 19:56.111
and a toddler.

19:57.529 --> 20:02.284
And the person that you love most
in the world

20:02.367 --> 20:06.205
and the person you trust splits.

20:07.289 --> 20:11.501
So, yeah, I kept Sam separate and safe.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.882
Because I didn't know
if you were gonna leave again.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.596
-Honey, I...
-It was wrong.

20:22.679 --> 20:23.972
I've been so angry,

20:24.056 --> 20:26.558
and I've been holding it over you
for so long.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.561
And I'm done. I'm done doing that.

20:30.854 --> 20:31.855
[sighs]

20:32.522 --> 20:34.316
He needs you. I need you.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.484
And...

20:36.235 --> 20:37.736
I'm sorry.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.197
You don't have to say sorry.

20:40.280 --> 20:44.493
Why don't we do this?
Why don't we just have a clean slate...

20:44.576 --> 20:45.827
for both of us?

20:47.621 --> 20:48.664
Clean slate.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.674
I love you.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.342
I love you, too.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.470
You built a really nice igloo.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.389
It is a nice igloo.

21:08.558 --> 21:12.229
All right. I need to find some kids
to bring this igloo in that school.

21:13.647 --> 21:17.651
I don't want Paige to have a breakdown.
She's hanging on by a thread already.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.963
[Sharice]  Something is up with you.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.465
What's wrong with you?

21:40.549 --> 21:42.175
Did you get into a fight with Evan?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.385
No.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.594
Maybe.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.471
Have a great time.

21:47.556 --> 21:51.268
Oh, girls! Look how great you all look.
So beautiful.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.854
Did you see Christopher?
Look how sharp he is.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.605
I want to leave.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.735
Here you go. You guys, go ahead
and go in there. We'll be in soon.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.987
Then we can all shake our booties toget--

Oh, what? Like you don't know it?

22:46.740 --> 22:47.866
Wow.

22:47.949 --> 22:48.992
I know.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.578
Aw! My garlands look so pretty.

22:51.661 --> 22:54.998
I made every snowflake uniquely different,
just like real-life nature does.

-Look at you! You look fantastic!

23:00.670 --> 23:02.130
-You look so good.
-Thank you.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.966
Did you see the igloo?
I made this igloo. You like this?

23:05.717 --> 23:07.511
-Pretty good, right?
-It's amazing.

23:07.594 --> 23:10.722
I even used the stuffing from Paige's
murdered penguin as a snow base.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.474
-Oh, my God.
-I'm gonna go stand by it

23:12.557 --> 23:16.186
and make sure no bozos spill punch on it.
Okay, you girls, you look magical.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.729
All right, have a great night.

I should be able to find it.

-That's not helpful.
-No.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.812
You want me to get it for you?

25:23.563 --> 25:26.524
[Sam]  If one man can protect millions
of marine animals

25:26.608 --> 25:28.026
just by swimming,

25:28.109 --> 25:31.196
one quick dip can certainly
help fix things with Paige.

25:31.279 --> 25:33.198
No, thank you, Zahid.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.868
The hero must complete his
or her own mission of redemption.

25:43.667 --> 25:47.003
Okay, see, no, no.
Only three-quarters of a cup per person.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.130
We're not made of punch.

25:49.214 --> 25:53.093
[shoes squeaking]

25:57.639 --> 25:58.807
I found this.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.647
What-- how? Why?

26:05.730 --> 26:09.401
"How" is I retraced your steps on Tuesday
and found it in the pool.

26:09.484 --> 26:12.070
And "why" is that I feel bad
for breaking your heart,

26:12.153 --> 26:14.447
so this is my apology.

26:14.531 --> 26:15.949
Do you forgive me?

26:16.992 --> 26:18.868
Meet me in the igloo in two minutes.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.335
Hey, dance with me.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.921
I only have two minutes,
and I don't like to slow dance.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.631
-Shut up.
-Okay.

26:31.715 --> 26:32.924
Here.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.385
Ew! Why are you wet?

26:35.468 --> 26:37.971
You know what? Never mind.
I don't care. Just...

26:38.847 --> 26:39.889
Hey.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.559
I don't have to go to Clayton Prep.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.436
What?

26:44.519 --> 26:48.481
I mean, like, Sam,
if you need me or whatever,

26:49.024 --> 26:51.109
I can turn the scholarship down.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.194
That would be dumb.

26:55.196 --> 26:59.409
Well... like what if something happens
like yesterday and I'm not there?

27:00.744 --> 27:02.454
I know you think you have to protect me,

27:02.537 --> 27:05.999
but I have Mom and Dad
and lots of other people. You can go.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.462
Well, what if you
didn't have Mom and Dad?

27:10.545 --> 27:13.381
Like, what if they weren't together?

27:13.465 --> 27:16.634
Like, if Dad was at work?
I guess I'd wait for him to come home.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.388
It's definitely been two minutes.
I have to go.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.477
[soft music plays]

27:39.866 --> 27:41.242
Hi.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.702
Can you come get me?

27:43.870 --> 27:45.205
[Sam] This is a good igloo.

27:45.955 --> 27:47.791
Way better than his last one.

27:51.086 --> 27:54.798
So what's going on here, Sam?

27:54.881 --> 27:58.385
I mean, you show up with
my necklace and soaking wet.

27:58.468 --> 28:02.097
I mean, what do you want?
Do you want to get back together?

28:03.973 --> 28:07.477
I want to try to explain,
but I might have to talk about animals,

28:07.560 --> 28:09.437
and I know that annoys you sometimes.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.899
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.151
In nature, it's simple.

28:15.902 --> 28:19.197
Animals are drawn to mate
with an appropriate specimen,

28:19.280 --> 28:23.243
and they spread their wings
or show their colorful rump and mate.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.453
That makes sense.

28:26.162 --> 28:29.999
They don't have love.
They don't have hurt feelings.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.377
They don't have dances.

28:33.962 --> 28:37.424
Actually, some birds do dance,
and there are some ridiculous dances.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.217
Okay, I'm sorry to be short,

28:39.300 --> 28:41.678
but I have a lot of people counting
on me out there.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.304
So, what's the point?

28:48.893 --> 28:51.312
I wanted to make
all this girlfriend stuff simple,

28:51.396 --> 28:53.231
but it's not simple.

28:55.024 --> 28:56.901
I don't know if I love you.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.154
I don't know who I love anymore.

29:00.029 --> 29:04.200
But you're funny and pretty,

29:04.284 --> 29:06.786
and I like the way you pinch your nose
when you sneeze.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.999
And I'm really, really sorry
I hurt your feelings.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.171
Okay.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.840
I appreciate your honesty.

29:20.842 --> 29:24.304
But you didn't appreciate it
at the Olive Garden.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.182
Because that was
in front of my whole family.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.518
Got it. That's the difference.

29:34.606 --> 29:38.109
Well... I don't think we should be
boyfriend and girlfriend again

29:38.193 --> 29:39.944
until you're sure of what you want.

29:40.862 --> 29:41.821
Okay.

29:43.823 --> 29:46.326
But that doesn't mean
we can't mess around a little.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.547
[Evan] Hey.

30:03.551 --> 30:04.677
You okay?

30:07.180 --> 30:08.723
My mom had an affair.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.438
Here, come here.

30:22.403 --> 30:23.613
I knew she was a dick.

30:23.696 --> 30:26.032
I just didn't know she was
that big of a dick.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.871
Sorry I was so weird to you.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.541
No, it's, um...

30:35.500 --> 30:36.668
it's okay.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.670
I was, uh...

30:39.838 --> 30:40.922
an idiot.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.509
And when you didn't say
that you loved me back,

30:44.592 --> 30:47.262
I just... I felt like a tool.

30:48.346 --> 30:53.101
But I really don't care
whether you say it or not.

30:53.184 --> 30:56.938
I love you, and... and that's that.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.441
Yeah?

31:01.276 --> 31:02.443
Yeah.

31:04.153 --> 31:07.991
And I should have been more mature,
so, um, how about this?

31:08.074 --> 31:10.076
I'll race you to the top of those steps.

31:10.159 --> 31:12.662
And if I win,
then you have to love me back.

31:13.496 --> 31:14.581
That sounds fair.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.040
-Doesn't it?
-Mm-hmm.

31:17.667 --> 31:18.501
Go!

31:26.426 --> 31:28.928
[panting]

31:30.179 --> 31:31.264
Oh.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.770
I totally love you.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.034
Hey, Doug. Having fun?

31:51.117 --> 31:52.869
Hey, guys. Sure. You?

31:52.952 --> 31:54.621
Well, let's just put it this way,

31:54.704 --> 31:56.456
I'm glad I brought comic books.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.834
Uh, Luisa, I'm sorry to hear
about your cousin.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.836
-My cousin?
-Who died.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.463
Elsa was at the memorial.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.841
Oh, right... my cousin.

32:06.925 --> 32:07.926
Uh...

32:08.009 --> 32:09.844
We weren't super close, so I don't...

32:09.928 --> 32:12.639
I don't, uh, think about it a lot.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.015
What? Who died?

32:14.098 --> 32:15.934
What's he talking about?

32:16.434 --> 32:20.146
Honey, you have to try the photo booth.
They have the cutest props.

32:20.229 --> 32:22.148
-Look at this hat.
-Hmm.

32:22.231 --> 32:23.107
[chuckles]

32:24.484 --> 32:26.194
I just got a hand job in an igloo.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.322
Dude, awesome!

32:34.661 --> 32:36.871
[Sam]  Living in Antarctica can be chilly.

32:46.172 --> 32:49.634
As Antarctic winter descends
the ice continues to grow,

32:49.717 --> 32:52.595
effectively doubling the size
of the continent.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.263
Doubling it!

33:02.563 --> 33:04.899
[Sam]  In this way,
the cold creates matter.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.568
It has presence. It takes up space.

33:08.403 --> 33:11.406
Miles? What are you doing here?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.116
Hey.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.743
I got your messages.

33:16.744 --> 33:17.954
Julia...

33:25.920 --> 33:26.921
You win.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.674
Let's get married.

33:32.593 --> 33:34.512
I-- I win?

33:38.099 --> 33:40.518
[Sam]  Recently, researchers
have discovered that

33:40.601 --> 33:43.271
when penguins make even
the smallest movement together,

33:43.354 --> 33:45.898
they create a unique
behavioral warming structure.

33:45.982 --> 33:49.569
So emperor penguins
perform a mass dance to keep warm.

33:49.652 --> 33:52.572
[dance music playing]

33:58.077 --> 34:00.997
[Sam]  They heat up the planet by dancing.

34:08.671 --> 34:09.714
Dad?

34:10.423 --> 34:12.091
It's a really good igloo.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.100
That's the first time
you ever hugged me on your own.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.478
Oh.

34:30.234 --> 34:33.946
[Sam]  But you wouldn't expect such
a little thing to make a difference.

34:34.030 --> 34:37.366
So does your mom know that you know?

34:37.450 --> 34:38.451
No.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.745
I've just been a total jerk to her.

34:41.496 --> 34:45.166
I even left a passive-aggressive note
on her stupid to-do board.

34:46.542 --> 34:49.879
One penguin couldn't
warm up like that on its own.

34:49.962 --> 34:51.631
They do it by being together.

34:51.714 --> 34:53.841
Why would she write that on there, huh?

34:59.889 --> 35:02.225
It's weird
that she would write that, isn't it?
