waves crashing)

00:07.674 --> 00:09.592
What is wrong
with this VCR?

00:09.676 --> 00:11.094
Rejection is cruel.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.096
{\an1}I think
you mean ejection.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.180
Look,

00:14.264 --> 00:16.015
now I want you guys
to give me your honest opinion

00:16.099 --> 00:16.933
about my weather spot, okay?

00:17.016 --> 00:18.893
Okay. Can we
have popcorn?

00:18.977 --> 00:20.270
No, no. Just hold on.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.605
I'll get it in a second.
I got it.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.649
{\an1}Hey, why don't you just do
the show live here

00:24.733 --> 00:26.484
{\an1}in the living room,
and we'll give you pointers.

00:26.568 --> 00:27.610
Yeah.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.195
Damn.
Mm!

00:29.279 --> 00:30.613
Nice elocution.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.281
Mm! I like her poise.

00:32.365 --> 00:35.452
Here. Give it to me.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.745
(doorbell rings)
(groans)

00:36.828 --> 00:37.954
{\an3}Oh. Wait.

00:38.037 --> 00:39.164
{\an3}Don't start
it yet.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.373
No, wait,

00:40.457 --> 00:42.250
{\an3}you have to put
the cable on

00:42.333 --> 00:43.877
to channel two.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.593
(whispers):
Yay.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.304
Oh, my God,
these are beautiful.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.472
I've never seen that.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.514
{\an3}Oh, they're
sterling silvers.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.766
They're really rare.

00:57.849 --> 00:58.975
Mm!

00:59.058 --> 01:01.436
{\an3}If these are from Steve,
I will pass out.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.354
Oh, if they're for me,
I'll pass out.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.605
{\an1}They're for me.
Aw.

01:04.688 --> 01:05.565
{\an3}Well, that's
nice of David.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.609
Aw...

01:07.692 --> 01:09.694
{\an1}I don't think
they're from David.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.614
"Donna, you're
my one and only.

01:12.697 --> 01:13.948
Your number one fan."

01:14.032 --> 01:15.533
My number one creep.

01:17.243 --> 01:20.330
{\an4}CLARE:
Don, you haven't had
a crank call in over a week.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.499
And maybe this is from somebody
different, somebody genuine.

01:22.582 --> 01:23.875
Yeah.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.293
{\an3}What are you
talking about?

01:25.376 --> 01:27.045
{\an3}The only reason the
calls stopped is

01:27.128 --> 01:28.838
{\an3}'cause I changed my
number last week.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.673
{\an3}Now this guy knows
where I live.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.091

03:23.161 --> 03:25.121
I was in such a hurry
to get to C.U.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.248
I had my bags packed

Super Bowl weekend
and everything.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.843
Well, it was a tough decision.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.304
A weekend in the country
with a beautiful woman,

03:41.387 --> 03:43.306
or a day in front
of the television set

03:43.389 --> 03:45.808
with a bunch of guys
drinking beer and burping.

03:45.892 --> 03:49.020

do have a TV, don't they?

03:49.103 --> 03:50.980

04:20.927 --> 04:22.178

04:22.262 --> 04:24.305
{\an1}Oh, nothing
I can't handle.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.018
Afternoon, Trace.

{\an3}Long time.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.064
Sam. What are you doing here?

04:33.147 --> 04:34.023
Oh, your folks asked me

04:34.107 --> 04:35.900
to hold down the fort
till you showed up.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.151
{\an1}TRACY:
Sam, Brandon.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.152
Brandon, Sam.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.030
How you doing?

04:41.114 --> 04:44.033
{\an6}Your mom said
to tell you she
fixed up your room.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.868
And the guest
room, I guess.

04:45.952 --> 04:46.869
Hmm. Love that mom.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.038
{\an6}SAM:
Listen, my folks
would love to see you.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.707
Why don't I run you over there
for a quick visit?

04:50.790 --> 04:51.916
Well, maybe later.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.252
Okay.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.421
Oh, there's... there's
one other thing. Uh...

04:56.504 --> 05:00.216
Your mare, Lea-- I think
she's coming down with colic.

05:00.299 --> 05:02.093
{\an3}She was in a sweat
and agitated.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.761
I got her cooling down
in the barn.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.513
{\an3}Oh, thanks.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.603
Come on,
let's go check on Lea.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.896
Old boyfriend, huh?

05:13.980 --> 05:14.939
Mm. How'd you know?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.941
Wild guess.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.027
{\an1}So much for being alone
this weekend.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.194
(engine starting)

05:22.989 --> 05:24.615
{\an3}Now, we need a
marketing strategy.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.117
Simple's best.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.952
Spoken like a
true KEG man.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.245
Hey, watch it.

05:29.328 --> 05:30.413
(mumbles)

05:30.496 --> 05:31.914
What's wrong
with this picture?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.916
{\an3}Hey, Clare.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.418
{\an4}Get over here,
you goddess.
Hi.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.919
{\an1}I want you
to witness a merger.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.629
A historic merger.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.256
Two months ago, you were
at each other's throats.

05:40.339 --> 05:41.424
{\an3}Now you're
best friends?

05:41.507 --> 05:42.633
What's up with that?

05:42.717 --> 05:43.885
Hmm. Guys can do that.
It's cool.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.637
I mean, Steve and I have put
aside our personal differences

05:46.721 --> 05:48.347
and joined hands,
found a common ground.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.432
Yeah. Money.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.600
{\an4}(laughs)
STEVE:
All right.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.644
Yeah, we, uh, researched
the sports merchandising biz;

05:53.728 --> 05:55.772
found ourselves
a nice little gold mine.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.565
{\an1}We've got a gross
of football T-shirts.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.317
{\an1}But not just any
football T-shirts.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.694
{\an1}These are imported
from France.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.612

{\an1}<i>Oui.</i> And we are going
to make a killing.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.701
{\an1}We're gonna mark them up
300% and clean up.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.495
Yeah, we're gonna start
on campus, then sell the rest

06:10.578 --> 06:11.454
at the After Dark's
Super Saturday bash.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.915
{\an3}And, uh, what's...
what's the good cause?

06:13.998 --> 06:16.334
{\an3}Other than yourselves,
of course.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.460
Ouch. Clare, I'm wounded.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.837
{\an1}You think I would actually
succumb to out-and-out greed?

06:19.921 --> 06:23.257
{\an1}To shameless profiteering?
<i>Moi?!</i>

06:23.341 --> 06:26.010
{\an3}Just answer the
question, all right?

06:26.094 --> 06:29.597

08:57.161 --> 08:59.997
Okay.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.793

one question for you.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.002
What?

09:05.086 --> 09:06.963
What's up
for Super Bowl weekend?

09:07.046 --> 09:08.172
Please.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.423
{\an1}Right?
See, I have

09:09.507 --> 09:11.425
the exact same reaction.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.761
I mean, the entire weekend
is like the sociological study

09:13.844 --> 09:15.304
of what would happen to men

09:15.388 --> 09:17.181
if there were no women
on this planet.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.140
{\an3}I'm talking

09:18.224 --> 09:21.018
knuckles to the ground,
full-on regression.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.520
Well, I'll tell you,
one thing's for sure.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.313
I really don't want
to go to that party

09:24.397 --> 09:25.481
Saturday night
at the After Dark.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.316
Tell me about it.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.527
David's gonna be so busy,
he won't even notice me.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.153
I wish I could say the same

09:31.237 --> 09:32.822
for Steve and his new
best friend Dick.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.490
I'm sure they'll spend
the whole night trying

09:34.573 --> 09:36.367
to schmooze us into wearing
their cheesy T-shirts.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.077
{\an3}You know

09:38.160 --> 09:39.662
there'll be a water hose
right near by.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.163
Ain't that the truth.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.498
You know what?

09:42.581 --> 09:43.874
The hell with them.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.043
We should just have
a total girls' night out.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.420
Oh, I, uh... I don't know.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.504
Oh, come on.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.673
I saw this thing in the paper,
this advertisement.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.216
It looked like
it might be really cool.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.509
And what would that be?

09:53.592 --> 09:55.678
Uh... it's a secret.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.972
But, um, just be
dressed to kill

09:58.055 --> 10:00.016
{\an3}and ready to
cut loose.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.268
I'll get Kelly to
just drive, okay?

10:08.274 --> 10:09.317
(Donna gasps)

10:09.400 --> 10:11.527
Hello, Donna.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.154
(Donna shrieks)

10:13.237 --> 10:15.406
(Donna screaming)

10:15.489 --> 10:17.700
(muffled screaming)

10:17.783 --> 10:21.370
{\an5}GARRETT:
<i>Darn it! Why did you have</i>
<i>to be so tense?</i>

10:21.454 --> 10:22.663
{\an3}CLARE:
Don?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.081
Hello?

10:24.165 --> 10:25.958
It's him.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.668
{\an3}It's who?

10:27.752 --> 10:30.379
Garrett. Garrett Slan.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.006
{\an3}CLARE:
I don't see him.

10:32.089 --> 10:34.216
By the column-- God, Clare,
he was standing right there!

10:34.300 --> 10:35.926
Maybe it was just someone
that looked like him.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.428
No, I know what he looks like.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.555
God, Clare, he nearly raped me
two years ago.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.599
Don't you think
I know what he looks like?

10:41.682 --> 10:43.351
He's in prison, Don.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.102
I'm telling you
that I saw him.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.271
I don't know how.
I don't...

10:47.355 --> 10:48.981
I just know, and now it...

10:49.065 --> 10:50.733
now it all makes sense to me.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.069
{\an1}DONNA (crying):
He's the one

10:53.152 --> 10:54.945
that's obviously been doing
all these things to me.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.280
Think about this
rationally, okay?

10:56.364 --> 10:58.407
Why would Garrett Slan
be sending you flowers?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.742
It makes no sense.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.077
Forget it. Never mind.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.203
Never mind!

11:03.204 --> 11:05.247
(sighs)

11:07.124 --> 11:08.876
(Tracy laughing)

11:08.959 --> 11:10.544
{\an3}Quite a nice place
to grow up.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.171
{\an1}Yeah, did I tell you
Norman Rockwell

11:12.254 --> 11:13.047
{\an1}was one
of our neighbors?

11:13.130 --> 11:14.048
That's not funny.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.050
You know, the last time

11:16.133 --> 11:19.095
I pushed a girl on
a swing like this,

11:19.178 --> 11:20.971
I was head over
heels for her.

11:21.055 --> 11:23.057
{\an3}She ended up the
same way.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.600
When was this?

11:24.683 --> 11:26.602
Summer after
sixth grade.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.104
{\an3}Carol Nealon was
her name.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.147
{\an3}I guess you could say she
was my first love.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.109
{\an3}I had her convinced I
was a secret agent.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.276
No.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.611
Yeah.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.113
Special Agent
Brandon Walsh,

11:37.196 --> 11:40.116
{\an3}of the Extraterrestrial
Task Force.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.451
{\an3}I convinced her to go up
to the lake with me

11:42.535 --> 11:44.453
{\an6}and stake it out
for UFOs.
Mm.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.122
Well, how could she resist?

11:46.205 --> 11:47.289
{\an3}How <i> could</i> she
resist?

11:47.373 --> 11:49.291
{\an3}But, needless to
say, she, uh,

11:49.375 --> 11:51.293
{\an3}got bored very
quickly.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.295
{\an3}Thankfully, there was
a swing like this

11:53.379 --> 11:54.797
{\an3}tied to an old
tree nearby.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.966
{\an3}And she started
swinging;

11:57.049 --> 11:59.510
I started pushing her...

11:59.593 --> 12:02.847
{\an3}I don't know, I guess I got
kind of, uh, mesmerized

12:02.930 --> 12:04.974
{\an3}by her long
brown hair,

12:05.057 --> 12:07.977
{\an3}the way it cascaded
down her back,

12:08.060 --> 12:11.105
and then sort of flew
up and fanned out...

12:12.731 --> 12:14.650
{\an3}...until it got caught
on a branch.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.860
{\an1}(laughing):
No.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.862
Yeah.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.865
{\an6}I did tell you she
ended up head over
heels, didn't I?

12:20.948 --> 12:22.283
(sighs)

12:22.366 --> 12:25.286
{\an1}Well, you don't have
to impress me, Agent Walsh.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.830
{\an3}That's, uh, Special
Agent Walsh

12:27.913 --> 12:30.040
of the Extraterrestrial
Task Force.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.792
Special indeed.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.835
Mm-hmm.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.628
{\an1}Want to go back
to the house?

12:34.712 --> 12:36.005
(distant):
Tracy!

12:36.088 --> 12:38.007
Trace, you there?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.967
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.052
{\an3}No, no, no, nothing
at all.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.554
Hey, your mare's
in quite a stir.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.014
She's pawing the ground.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.183
Her heart rate's up;
I think she's in pain.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.350
Is it colic?

12:48.434 --> 12:49.310
Yep, I think so.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.187
I need you to help me
get her halter on,

12:51.270 --> 12:52.354
so I can twitch her.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.190
And I think it would
be a wise choice

12:54.273 --> 12:56.275
if you'd bed down
near her tonight.

12:59.069 --> 13:02.156
{\an1}Uh, okay, why don't
we meet you in the barn.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.871
Guy's got
impeccable timing.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.873
{\an1}Yeah, well, he's
a third-year vet student.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.333
So if he says
it's urgent,

13:12.416 --> 13:14.710
it's urgent.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.796
Uh, Brandon...

13:17.880 --> 13:20.549
before I left for college,
Sam asked me to marry him.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.343
And?

13:22.426 --> 13:24.053
And I said no.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.387
Any regrets?

13:25.471 --> 13:27.890
Not a one.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.934
Good.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.067
(security alarm blaring)

13:38.150 --> 13:39.527
{\an1}KELLY: What's
going on out there?

13:39.610 --> 13:41.529
Stop it! Stop it!

13:41.612 --> 13:44.365
{\an3}What're you doing?
God!

13:44.448 --> 13:46.367
{\an4}I heard a noise,
so I came out here
and the alarm wasn't on.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.743
{\an5}Now I can't shut
the thing off!
KELLY:
What's going on out there?

13:47.826 --> 13:49.745
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I got it, Kel.

13:49.828 --> 13:50.621
It's just the alarm.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.748
{\an1}There's obviously
something wrong with it.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.750
There's nothing
wrong with it.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.544
{\an1}Well, we need--
we really--

13:56.627 --> 13:57.920
we need to start
using that thing.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.296
Okay, we will.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.507
{\an5}What did you hear?
I don't,
I don't know.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.639
There's nothing
out there, okay?

14:08.722 --> 14:10.766
{\an1}Probably just
the wind chimes.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.727
This is what
we're gonna do--

14:13.811 --> 14:16.522
gonna lock the door,
gonna turn the alarm on

14:16.605 --> 14:17.606
{\an1}and we're gonna
go to bed.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.608
{\an3}Look, Clare, don't
patronize me.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.026
Please. Okay?
I'm not, okay?

14:21.110 --> 14:22.987
I'm just tired.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.990
{\an1}You're worrying yourself
sick about nothing.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.575
Come on, let's go.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.743
{\an3}No, you, you
go to bed.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.745
I'm fine; really.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.831
{\an3}Thank you.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.172
(wind chimes tinkling)

14:58.063 --> 15:00.190
(grunts)

15:01.191 --> 15:02.860
Just relax.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.945
{\an1}I won't be needing
this anymore.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.948
Please don't hurt me.

15:08.032 --> 15:11.160
Take anything you want.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.661
You're what I want.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.664
Please...

15:15.748 --> 15:17.666
I've never done this before.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.668
{\an1}What?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.795
A little tramp like you
is still a virgin?

15:21.879 --> 15:24.923
Please, please, let me go.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.556
(gasping)

15:33.766 --> 15:35.809
(gasping)

15:54.119 --> 15:56.163
(rooster crowing)

16:02.086 --> 16:04.046
Good morning.
Are you sure?

16:04.129 --> 16:05.714
{\an3}The sun isn't
up yet.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.257
How'd you sleep?

16:07.341 --> 16:08.717
Oh, like a stone.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.719
{\an1}Good bed,
good guest room.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.054
I waited up for you.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.889
{\an3}I had to stay
with Lea.

16:13.972 --> 16:15.391
{\an3}She was a little
too jittery.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.393
Ah, and what about Sam?

16:17.476 --> 16:20.771
{\an3}Oh, he left right after
you went to bed.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.564
Okay.
Here.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.191
Have some breakfast.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.526
{\an3}Thanks, it looks
delicious.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.236
Aren't you exhausted?
No.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.446
{\an4}I sleep very good
on a hay bed.
Ah.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.740
{\an1}I only wish you
could have joined me.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.242
Well, what're you
doing right now?

16:33.325 --> 16:34.868
{\an3}Huh?

16:34.952 --> 16:36.912
{\an1}Mmm, I've got a lot
of chores to do.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.914
Well, I'll give you a hand.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.082
That's okay.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.917
Sam's moving the herd
to pasture.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.795
I'm feeding the livestock,
and you are on vacation.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.922
Hey, come on, Trace,
that's not fair.

16:47.005 --> 16:50.467
{\an3}I've spent my entire life
watching Little Joe and Hoss

16:50.551 --> 16:52.386
{\an3}and Hop Sing do their
thing on the Ponderosa.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.429
I took notes.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.097
{\an3}I even watch <i> Dr. Quinn Medicine</i>
<i>Woman.</i>

16:55.180 --> 16:56.557
{\an3}You do?
Well, okay,

16:56.640 --> 16:57.766
{\an3}I only watched
one episode.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.268
{\an3}But there was a sick
horse in it...

16:59.351 --> 17:01.270
{\an3}maybe it was a sick cow--
I can't tell the difference.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.272
No, I'm just-- come on,
let me give you a hand.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.606
Okay.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.483
{\an1}Suit yourself.
I'll be in the barn.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.445
The barn--

17:10.529 --> 17:12.614
that's that big white thing
with the red doors?

17:12.698 --> 17:14.742
See? I know.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.001
(sighs)

17:29.381 --> 17:31.300
{\an1}Hey, Val,
what's up?

17:31.383 --> 17:33.135
{\an3}When you're done
in here,

17:33.218 --> 17:35.137
{\an3}I've got some shirts
that need ironing.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.680
You're a slob,
you know that?

17:36.764 --> 17:38.307
{\an1}Why couldn't you eat
at the Peach Pit?

17:38.390 --> 17:40.309
Look, I'm sorry.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.145
{\an3}David and I were here
pretty late last night.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.355
Well, that's too bad.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.483
Because I'm much
better company.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.360
Well, I'm sure you are.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.196
{\an3}But we've got this
gig to pull off

17:52.279 --> 17:53.489
at the Super Bowl
party, you know.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.491
To hell with it.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.201
You work for me.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.244
Yeah.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.412
And David.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.416
{\an3}What?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.710
{\an1}I'll just be glad when
this weekend's over, you know?

18:06.794 --> 18:07.961
I'll have my club back.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.338
{\an3}It's David's club,
too, you know.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.631
I mean, he is
your partner.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.382
{\an1}What, are you
on his side now?

18:12.466 --> 18:14.968
I'm on both your sides.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.596
Traitor.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.681
Okay.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.231
(door opens)

18:28.982 --> 18:30.484
(door closes)

18:32.110 --> 18:33.654
No!

it's okay, it's okay, it's me.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.408
{\an4}David!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.202
I didn't mean
to scare you.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.537
I was just trying
to surprise you.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.163
{\an3}Kelly let me in.
I'm sorry.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.165

18:45.249 --> 18:46.333
{\an1}You okay?

18:46.416 --> 18:50.170
{\an1}Hey, what's wrong?
What's wrong?

18:50.254 --> 18:52.172
{\an3}David...

18:52.256 --> 18:53.882
I'm so scared.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.217
{\an3}(sniffling)

18:55.300 --> 18:57.052
{\an3}I'm having all
those nightmares again

18:57.135 --> 18:59.221
{\an3}about the guy that
almost raped me.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.098
Who? Who? Slan?

19:01.181 --> 19:02.140
{\an3}Yeah.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.433
Donna, he's in prison.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.436
{\an3}No, I think that
he got out.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.106
{\an3}I think that he's the one
that's been calling me,

19:09.189 --> 19:11.066
{\an3}and coming here
at night

19:11.149 --> 19:12.776
{\an3}and leaving me
the roses.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.237
{\an3}The one that's been doing
everything to me.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.280
{\an1}Donna, Donna,
listen to me...

19:16.363 --> 19:17.739
{\an3}And I think he wants
to get me.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.742
Donna, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, come on, come on.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.703
Listen to me, okay?
What?

19:22.786 --> 19:24.913
You know you're real visible

19:24.997 --> 19:27.374
{\an1}with this whole TV weather,
weather girl thing.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.126
{\an1}I mean, there's people
coming in and out

19:29.209 --> 19:30.460
of the studio
all day long.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.421
{\an1}It could be anybody
that's harassing you.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.422
{\an1}No.
Well, no--

19:33.505 --> 19:34.798
Why, why do you
think it's Slan?

19:34.882 --> 19:36.633
{\an3}Because I saw
him, okay?

19:36.717 --> 19:38.719
{\an3}Nobody believes me,
but I saw him.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.096
{\an3}And David, he knows,
he knows where I live.

19:41.179 --> 19:44.099
Donna, Department of Corrections
has to inform you

19:44.182 --> 19:45.976
{\an1}if they release him--
that's part of the deal.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.979
{\an3}Yeah, I know that
you're right.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.940
{\an3}But I... I still think
that I saw him.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.817
I saw, I saw him, David.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.444
{\an3}(sighs)
I saw him.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.529
Hey, come on.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.115
(crying)

20:00.198 --> 20:02.492
{\an1}You... You need to try
and relax, okay?

20:02.576 --> 20:06.496
{\an1}Look, the government offices
are closed today,

20:06.580 --> 20:09.499
{\an1}but what do you say,
first thing Monday morning,

20:09.583 --> 20:11.084
{\an1}we go down to the
Department of Corrections

20:11.168 --> 20:14.129
and we check up
on Slan, okay?

20:14.212 --> 20:16.214
Yeah, okay.
In the meantime,

20:16.298 --> 20:18.842
{\an1}I want you to have the alarm
system checked out here.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.303
{\an1}And...

20:21.386 --> 20:23.430
{\an1}I think you should go out
with Kelly and Clare.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.432
Have a good time,

20:25.515 --> 20:26.975
{\an1}try and shake this
thing off.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.977
{\an1}All right?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.146
{\an5}You think...
you think so?
Yeah.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.190
Yeah, I know you should.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.816
Okay.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.443
{\an1}Come on.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.654
{\an3}I'm so glad that
you're here.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.989
{\an1}Hey, it's okay.
Come here.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.116
It's okay.
Okay.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.506

21:00.425 --> 21:02.010

21:02.094 --> 21:04.179
{\an3}No comment.

21:04.262 --> 21:05.847
How long does it take
to go downtown

21:05.931 --> 21:07.015
to pick up a crate
of shirts?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.183
You know Dick--

21:08.266 --> 21:11.186
{\an1}he's not exactly
a downtown kinda guy.

21:11.269 --> 21:13.730
{\an1}Knowing him, he's probably
totally lost by now.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.691
Ah! Here we go!

21:15.774 --> 21:16.900
Finally!

21:16.984 --> 21:18.527
{\an3}Yeah-- many pardons,
partner.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.861
You ever been downtown?

21:19.945 --> 21:20.862
Yeah, I have.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.739
{\an6}Why do you think
I sent you?
Oh, thanks.

21:22.823 --> 21:23.699

21:23.782 --> 21:25.409

21:28.620 --> 21:30.038
Right on, just in time
for the Super Bowl.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.832
All right, line it up
on the left side here.

21:31.915 --> 21:32.916
Check this out.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.839
(mispronouncing):
"Mon-dey dew Football"?!

21:38.922 --> 21:40.716
What the hell is that?

21:40.799 --> 21:42.759
It's French for, uh,
"world of football."

21:42.843 --> 21:44.845
And that little black-and-white
ball in the center?

21:44.928 --> 21:47.431
That's to inform you that
"football," in French,

21:47.514 --> 21:49.224
and every other language

21:49.307 --> 21:52.394
except American English is,
uh, soccer.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.520
And it's <i> Monde du...</i>

21:53.603 --> 21:55.814
{\an5}<i>Football.</i>
Why didn't you check
this stuff

21:55.897 --> 21:57.774
{\an3}before you picked it up?
Oh, no, no, no, no!

21:57.858 --> 21:58.900
{\an5}Don't blame me!
You're the one
that ordered it

21:58.984 --> 22:01.236
{\an3}from Football International--
I mean, what is that?

22:01.319 --> 22:02.863

22:17.836 --> 22:20.964
Yeah, so can you.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.092
So, what are your
intentions toward Tracy?

22:24.176 --> 22:27.637
Could you be a little
more direct, Sam?

22:27.721 --> 22:28.930
Do you love her?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.724
I like her a lot, okay?

22:30.807 --> 22:31.725
That's all?

22:32.851 --> 22:34.936
No, I also admire her,

22:35.020 --> 22:36.146
respect her
and enjoy her company.

22:36.229 --> 22:38.607
{\an1}Is that good
enough for you?

22:38.690 --> 22:39.649
What?
You find that amusing?

22:39.733 --> 22:41.651
{\an3}Yeah, I do.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.154
Those are the exact same words
Tracy said to me...

22:44.237 --> 22:45.614
before she left.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.616
So what are you
sticking around for, Sam?

22:47.699 --> 22:48.825
You a glutton
for punishment?

22:50.869 --> 22:52.788
Look, why don't you
give Tracy and me

22:52.871 --> 22:53.789
a little time alone,

22:53.872 --> 22:55.791
{\an3}just to see
where we stand.

22:55.874 --> 22:56.792
Sorry, I can't do that.

22:56.875 --> 22:57.501
Why not?

22:57.584 --> 22:59.711
Because you had your time, Sam.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.421
This is our time now.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.757
And this interrogation
is over.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.808
You sure about this?

23:12.891 --> 23:13.975
Yeah.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.769
When I was a kid, I spent hours

23:15.852 --> 23:17.270
on the set of my mom's TV show.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.480
I'd help out the wardrobe lady

23:18.563 --> 23:19.815
just to keep from
dying of boredom.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.858
Yeah, but the shirts are still
gonna read <i> Monde du Football.</i>

23:21.942 --> 23:23.527
Yeah, but how many
people at this party

23:23.610 --> 23:24.736
do you think speak French?

23:24.820 --> 23:26.655
That's a good point.

23:26.738 --> 23:27.656
All right, let's move it.

Great.

the football patch

27:47.040 --> 27:48.541
Yeah, that's all right,
don't worry about it.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.918
Ladies, ladies, can
we talk about this?

27:50.001 --> 27:52.003
{\an1}Uh, maybe you didn't hear me
so good the first time.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.843
Okay, what do you guys
want to do now?

27:58.927 --> 28:00.720
{\an1}Want to go to, uh,
Drexel's for a martini?

28:00.804 --> 28:01.596
Sounds good.

28:01.679 --> 28:03.598
Uh, can we just stop by
the After Dark?

28:03.681 --> 28:04.599
It's right on the way.

28:04.682 --> 28:06.643
{\an1}Don... ugh...
I promised David.

28:06.726 --> 28:08.103
{\an6}Come on.
All right,
let's go.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.312
{\an1}CLARE:
Shotgun.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.607
Hey, buckle up.

28:12.690 --> 28:13.566
{\an3}CLARE:
Get in...

28:29.207 --> 28:31.209
(women whooping)

28:48.726 --> 28:50.770
('50s rock 'n' roll
melody playing)

29:01.072 --> 29:02.991
{\an3}Look, don't worry, we're
gonna sweep it all up

29:03.074 --> 29:05.535
and we're gonna put it back
the way we found it, okay?

29:05.618 --> 29:09.873
{\an1}So, you couldn't get
along without me, huh?

29:09.956 --> 29:12.834
Actually, we couldn't
get along without your key.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.627
I'll take that as a compliment.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.171
{\an3}Why don't you go
talk to David?

29:16.254 --> 29:18.006
{\an1}So he can rub tonight's
receipts in my face?

29:18.089 --> 29:19.174
I don't think so.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.717
{\an3}I don't think
he's gonna do that.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.676
How do you know?

29:21.759 --> 29:23.678
The cash register is jammed.

29:23.761 --> 29:25.889
He can't remember
the override code.

29:25.972 --> 29:29.309
{\an3}Why don't you go
talk to him?

29:33.313 --> 29:34.355
{\an1}Don't you have
anything smaller?

29:34.439 --> 29:36.691
{\an1}Forget it-- here-- the beer's
on the house, all right?

29:36.774 --> 29:37.650
Just take it.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.528
{\an1}Hey, where's that other keg
I asked for, man?

29:40.612 --> 29:42.197
We're all tapped out.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.323
{\an1}VALERIE:
Hey...

29:43.406 --> 29:44.365
need a hand?

29:44.449 --> 29:45.408
Yeah, I could use two.

29:45.492 --> 29:46.701
{\an1}What's the access
code to this?

29:46.784 --> 29:47.994
Oh.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.081
Man, I missed you.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.541
I bet.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.543
{\an1}Look, Val,
I'm sorry, all right?

29:55.627 --> 29:57.378
{\an1}I know, once I set
my mind to something,

29:57.462 --> 29:58.755
I tend to put
my blinders on

29:58.838 --> 30:00.173
{\an1}and I blow
everybody else off.

30:00.256 --> 30:01.174
David, it's okay.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.258
I know I'm stubborn, too.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.218
{\an3}Hey! Hey!

30:03.301 --> 30:04.886
{\an3}Can I get some service
around here, huh?!

30:04.969 --> 30:06.179
{\an1}Yeah, I'll be
right there, all right?

30:06.262 --> 30:08.556
I gotta get back to work.
<i>We</i> gotta get back to work.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.517
Hold on.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.580
{\an3}GIRL: There you are!
There you are!

30:32.664 --> 30:34.832
{\an1}GIRL 2:
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.970
Oh, we blend in.

30:47.053 --> 30:48.555
Oh, there's David.
See ya.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.139
Make it quick.

30:53.476 --> 30:54.519
Nice recovery.

30:54.602 --> 30:57.605
Yeah, a little needle-and-thread
and I'm out of the red.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.440
Hey, Steve, Clare.

30:59.524 --> 31:02.819
Oh! I see you got the girls
from Phi Lambda Slut, huh?

31:02.902 --> 31:03.820
Honey, bite your tongue.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.280
These girls are
professionals.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.573
Yeah, my point exactly.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.703
(horse whinnying)

31:18.876 --> 31:21.087
Is she gonna be okay?

31:21.170 --> 31:22.463
Yep.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.257
She's no longer impacted.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.259
And the Banamine's
settled her down.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.428
{\an1}So all I gotta do
is keep her hydrated.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.680
{\an3}Yeah, just do what
I told you.

31:30.763 --> 31:33.683
{\an1}Thanks, Sam.
You were terrific.

31:33.766 --> 31:36.311
Tracy, listen...

31:36.394 --> 31:39.355
when you left, you took
a piece of me with you.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.482
I want you back.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.359
{\an1}Sam, we've been down
this road before.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.111
And the answer is still no.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.654
{\an1}SAM:
Why?

31:46.738 --> 31:49.324
{\an1}TRACY: Because I've
changed, and you haven't.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.200
{\an3}Still, you can't be
serious about this guy...

31:52.076 --> 31:53.202
I can, and I am.

31:53.286 --> 31:56.706
I wish that you would stop being
so hardheaded and judgmental

31:56.789 --> 31:58.833
{\an1}and just get on with
the rest of your life.

31:58.916 --> 32:01.502
{\an1}I do want what's
best for you.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.255
{\an3}Yeah, well,
I'm looking at it.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.636
How we doing
in here, guys?

32:09.719 --> 32:14.515
Look, you need to stay with
her for the next few hours.

32:14.599 --> 32:20.355
{\an3}If there's any emergency,
I'm only a phone call away.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.815
Thanks.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.536
(sighs)

32:35.620 --> 32:37.538
{\an3}I can't blame
the guy for trying.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.706
I know I would.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.007
You know, you were so right.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.301
{\an1}I'm so glad I went out.
I'm having the best time.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.844
I wish I could say the same.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.179
So where've you guys been?

32:53.262 --> 32:56.265
Oh, just a little exhibit--

32:56.349 --> 32:59.394
I mean, it was a...
a dance recital...

32:59.477 --> 33:01.729
uh, from Australia.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.398
Really! What? Aborigines?

33:03.481 --> 33:07.276
Yeah, you know, something
a little wilder than that.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.696
I'm feeling so much better.

33:09.779 --> 33:11.239
{\an3}CLARE:
Hey, D,

33:11.322 --> 33:12.907
let's go.

33:12.990 --> 33:15.576
Oh, just give me five
more minutes, please?

33:15.660 --> 33:17.537
Okay. Five minutes.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.080
Where's Kelly gone?

33:19.163 --> 33:20.915
Uh, she's over there.

33:24.794 --> 33:25.920
Hello.

33:26.003 --> 33:27.755
Hey.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.259
{\an3}So, uh, you look,
uh, dangerous.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.468
I am.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.137
Look out.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.098
Kel, we're gonna go.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.475
Um, five minutes, okay?

33:39.559 --> 33:41.394
(sighs)

33:44.355 --> 33:46.274
Okay.

33:46.357 --> 33:47.650
Okay, babe.

33:47.734 --> 33:48.943
Good girl.

33:49.026 --> 33:50.611
(laughing)

33:50.695 --> 33:52.155
{\an3}Okay.

33:53.906 --> 33:56.075
{\an1}Hey, if, uh...
if I ever get colic,

33:56.159 --> 33:57.326
{\an1}will you
take care of me

33:57.410 --> 33:58.995
{\an1}like you take care
of that horse?

33:59.078 --> 34:01.122
{\an3}Only horses and
babies get colic.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.123
{\an1}I don't know,
that horse

34:02.206 --> 34:04.083
{\an1}gets more attention
than any baby I've ever seen.

34:04.167 --> 34:04.959
Shh!

34:05.042 --> 34:07.295
She might hear you
and have a relapse.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.052
What are you looking at?

34:15.136 --> 34:16.721
(Texas accent):
My favorite cowgirl.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.306
You want to play
home rodeo, darling?

34:18.389 --> 34:19.139
{\an3}Be careful.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.850
{\an3}I'm the one with
the roping ribbons.

34:20.933 --> 34:22.435
Oh, that's right.

34:22.518 --> 34:25.228
There isn't much around here
you can't handle, is there?

34:25.313 --> 34:26.606
Well, it is home.

34:26.688 --> 34:27.482
{\an3}Yes, it is,

34:27.565 --> 34:29.609
and Sam intends on
keeping you here.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.652
Why did you guys
break up, anyway?

34:33.862 --> 34:36.991
{\an1}Well, Sam's a man
of very few words...

34:37.074 --> 34:41.536
and even fewer ideas
about life, liberty

34:41.621 --> 34:43.039
{\an1}and the pursuit
of happiness.

34:43.121 --> 34:46.667
So, what we had...

34:46.751 --> 34:50.755
what we shared, it just
came to its conclusion.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.341
You either feel something
for someone or you don't.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.595
{\an3}What are you doing with
a city guy like me?

34:58.763 --> 35:00.389
{\an1}What I've been doing
since the day I met you.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.516
{\an3}Mm...

35:05.853 --> 35:07.396
What's wrong?

35:07.480 --> 35:09.524
Isn't this about the time
when Sam usually comes in?

35:09.607 --> 35:10.817
(chuckles)

35:10.900 --> 35:12.401
I locked the door
from the inside.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.861
So he couldn't get in.

35:13.945 --> 35:14.862
And you can't get out.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.447
{\an3}Oh, boy.

35:20.409 --> 35:21.577
(horse whinnying)

35:21.661 --> 35:23.204
(sighs) Thank God
we got out of there.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.540
{\an1}Way to block-- I didn't think
we were gonna make it.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.250
{\an3}Did you see those
skanks in there

35:27.333 --> 35:28.709
{\an3}shaking their
t-shirts?

35:28.793 --> 35:30.586
{\an1}Tom looked
kind of cute, huh?

35:30.670 --> 35:31.754
Well, he's taken.

35:31.838 --> 35:32.713
{\an3}Ask Val.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.757
{\an5}Where's Donna?
Oh, she's
right behind us.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.717
Donna, come on!

35:36.801 --> 35:38.719
I'm coming.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.930
Oh, God.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.391
(coins jangling)

35:43.474 --> 35:45.476
(engine starting)

35:45.560 --> 35:46.602
(screeching)

35:47.645 --> 35:48.688
Donna, look out!

35:51.983 --> 35:54.068
(tires screeching)

35:54.152 --> 35:55.820
(car alarm blaring)

36:00.283 --> 36:01.742
{\an3}CLARE:
Oh, my God.

36:01.826 --> 36:02.743
Are you okay?

36:02.827 --> 36:04.245
No, no, I'm not okay!

36:04.328 --> 36:05.371
I told you guys!

36:05.454 --> 36:06.747
I told you somebody
was after me!

36:06.831 --> 36:07.623
God!

36:07.707 --> 36:09.208
{\an5}Hey, come on.
(crying,
muttering)

36:09.292 --> 36:10.585
Come on, let's go.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.004
Hey, it's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

36:13.087 --> 36:14.672
{\an3}God!

36:21.804 --> 36:25.099
(rooster crowing)

36:25.182 --> 36:26.601
Morning.

36:26.684 --> 36:27.768
Good morning.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.645
Well, you're not
allergic to hay.

36:29.729 --> 36:30.605
That's a good sign.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.273
Mm. How's Lea?

36:32.356 --> 36:33.274
{\an3}She's good.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.483
She's doing
much better.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.028
She drank all her
water last night.

36:37.111 --> 36:39.113
That's good.

36:39.196 --> 36:40.573
{\an3}Brandon.

36:40.656 --> 36:41.949
{\an1}Mm-hmm?

36:42.033 --> 36:44.076
Tell me honestly...

36:44.160 --> 36:46.287
{\an3}what was the first
thing you thought of

36:46.370 --> 36:47.914
after we...
(chuckling)

36:47.997 --> 36:49.165
{\an3}(sighs)

36:49.248 --> 36:51.083
{\an1}A gentleman
never tells, see?

36:51.167 --> 36:53.461
{\an3}Chicken.

36:53.544 --> 36:54.921
{\an1}Okay.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.505
Where I come from,

36:56.589 --> 36:59.675
{\an1}women who sleep
with chickens go first.

37:01.594 --> 37:03.262
{\an3}Well...

37:03.346 --> 37:05.681
{\an3}I couldn't help
wondering...

37:05.765 --> 37:07.850
{\an3}did I leave
the stove on?

37:07.934 --> 37:09.810
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.312
{\an3}Come on, it's
your turn.

37:14.231 --> 37:16.859
Okay, I remember
thinking, um...

37:16.943 --> 37:20.321
{\an1}"All good things come
to those who wait."

37:23.950 --> 37:27.745
{\an1}Are we, uh...
are we okay here?

37:29.413 --> 37:30.665
{\an3}(sighs)

37:30.748 --> 37:33.042
{\an3}Just don't make me
regret this, Brandon.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.671
Same goes for you.

37:38.881 --> 37:39.799
(Brandon clearing throat)

37:50.810 --> 37:51.978
What time is it?

37:52.061 --> 37:53.229
{\an1}Sorry.
Did we wake you?

37:53.312 --> 37:55.564
{\an3}Oh! Like I could
sleep anyway.

37:55.648 --> 37:57.358
{\an3}What do you think about
what Donna said?

37:57.441 --> 37:58.567
{\an3}Do you think
there's any chance

37:58.651 --> 38:00.736
{\an3}that guy in the car's
really after her?

38:00.820 --> 38:02.196
I don't know.

38:02.279 --> 38:04.573
Either that or he was
just very, very drunk.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.575
{\an1}All I do know is
that she seems

38:06.659 --> 38:08.369
completely fixated
on that guy who tried

38:08.452 --> 38:10.705
to rape her, which is
not possible, right?

38:10.788 --> 38:11.664
{\an1}Excuse me.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.667
Can I be included
in this conversation

38:14.750 --> 38:17.003
or do you want to continue
to talk behind my back?

38:17.086 --> 38:18.921
{\an5}Donna, we were just
worried about you.
Yeah.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.506
{\an1}DONNA: Yeah, well,
that makes three of us.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.883
Fine, go ahead, you guys can
call me paranoid,

38:22.967 --> 38:25.261
but I know that
there's somebody after me.

38:25.344 --> 38:27.513
And if it's not Garrett Slan,
then it's somebody else.

38:27.596 --> 38:28.431
{\an3}CLARE:
Okay, look,

38:28.514 --> 38:29.849
{\an3}we gave a car description
to the police.

38:29.932 --> 38:33.019
{\an6}They're gonna get
back to us as soon as
they find anything out.

38:33.102 --> 38:36.772
You know, until then, maybe I
should stay at my parents' house

38:36.856 --> 38:37.940
while they're still in Europe.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.818
Then you guys don't have
to be burdened by my fixations.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.780
Donna...

38:44.864 --> 38:46.615
(door slams)

39:12.183 --> 39:13.434
Yeah, perfect, great.

39:13.517 --> 39:15.227
Thank you so much.

39:15.311 --> 39:16.479
Have a good day.

39:16.562 --> 39:17.938
Ooh! Hey, David.

39:18.022 --> 39:18.939
Hey.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.441
So, what do you think?

39:20.524 --> 39:22.443
Uh, it's a new desk.

39:22.526 --> 39:23.277
Yep.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.780
{\an3}What was wrong
with the old one?

39:25.863 --> 39:27.448
Well, everything.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.950
{\an1}I mean, for starters,
it was completely one-sided.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.620
Totally wrong.

39:32.703 --> 39:33.746
(chuckles)

39:33.829 --> 39:35.456
What, what are you
talking about?

39:35.539 --> 39:38.167
This is a partners' desk;
two can play.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.585
Care to join me?

39:41.879 --> 39:44.507
All right, partner,
what do you propose?

39:44.590 --> 39:48.302
{\an1}Well, that we can agree
to disagree.

39:48.385 --> 39:49.637
{\an3}Agreed.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.972
{\an1}And we clean up our own mess
when we make it?

39:52.056 --> 39:53.015
Absolutely.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.975
Good. Then it's settled.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.644
Val, just one more thing.

39:56.727 --> 39:57.812
What is it?

39:57.895 --> 40:00.731
Uh, could you get
your feet off my desk?

40:22.920 --> 40:23.712
You know, it's funny,

40:23.796 --> 40:26.173
{\an3}but I think Sam
started to grow on me.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.467
I'm gonna miss him.

40:30.052 --> 40:32.054
{\an1}I think you should go
tell him.

40:37.726 --> 40:39.728
{\an1}Well, Sam,

40:39.812 --> 40:41.313
it's been an education.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.065
For me, too.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.066
At least now I can honestly say

40:44.150 --> 40:46.235
I know a thing or two
about horses with colic.

40:46.318 --> 40:48.362
{\an1}You think she's gonna be up
and around soon?

40:48.445 --> 40:49.363
Oh, sure.

40:49.446 --> 40:52.324
She's a spirited gal...

40:52.408 --> 40:53.659
like some people we know.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.539
Treat her right,
you hear?

40:58.622 --> 41:00.207
I will.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.084
Take care, man.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.878
You, too.

41:06.505 --> 41:08.507
{\an3}Come on.

41:08.591 --> 41:09.758
Let's go home.

41:09.842 --> 41:10.926
{\an3}All right.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.561
{\an3}Nat, I'm telling you,
it's the last one.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.563
It's the last one
and it's your size.

41:22.646 --> 41:25.357
{\an3}Look, extra special.
Only 15 bucks.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.193
I got mine for 12, Nat.

41:27.276 --> 41:28.444
{\an3}Kelly...

41:28.527 --> 41:29.403
I'll give you ten.
I'll throw in breakfast.

41:29.486 --> 41:31.572
Side of sausage?

41:31.655 --> 41:32.781
Oh, you pain.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.074
Sold!

41:34.158 --> 41:35.576
{\an3}Well, it's official:
we're a sellout,

41:35.659 --> 41:36.869
{\an3}and I mean that
literally.

41:36.952 --> 41:38.829
I love that guy.

41:38.913 --> 41:42.082
{\an1}Clare, I'm really worried
about you

41:42.166 --> 41:43.459
and all the other guys.

41:43.542 --> 41:44.919
Don't be.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.213
{\an3}Our local security
patrol's been notified,

41:47.296 --> 41:49.256
{\an3}our alarm's working fine;
everything's cool.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.717
{\an1}Now if we could just get
Donna to talk to us.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.011
Give her some space.
She'll be all right.

41:54.094 --> 41:56.805
David'll take care of Donna,
but I think you should stay

41:56.889 --> 41:59.099
at Casa Walsh at least
till we catch this guy.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.226
What about Kelly?

42:00.309 --> 42:01.143
{\an1}STEVE: Well, that's
not a problem.

42:01.227 --> 42:03.771
{\an1}Luckily for her, I've got
a California king.

42:03.854 --> 42:04.772
Mm, that's so nice of you.

42:04.855 --> 42:05.898
{\an1}But where are you
gonna sleep?

42:05.981 --> 42:06.899
Hah!

42:06.982 --> 42:09.109
{\an3}DAVID:
Hey, good morning, guys.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.569
{\an6}BOTH:
Hey, David.
Hey.

42:12.154 --> 42:13.113
Hey.
(kisses)

42:13.197 --> 42:14.114
DONNA:
Hey.

42:14.198 --> 42:15.115
How you doing?

42:15.199 --> 42:17.743
Better now that you're here.

42:17.826 --> 42:18.953
(both chuckle)

42:19.036 --> 42:20.579
What's all that?

42:20.663 --> 42:22.748
Oh, my mom and dad's mail.

42:22.831 --> 42:23.707
Two weeks' worth.

42:23.791 --> 42:26.669
I just picked it up
at my family's P.O. box.

42:26.752 --> 42:29.421
{\an3}I just can't believe all
this junk mail they send...

42:29.505 --> 42:31.048
(both chuckle)

42:41.225 --> 42:42.977
What? What's wrong?

42:46.563 --> 42:47.564
"Department of Corrections."

42:49.858 --> 42:52.569
Oh, God! Oh, God, David!

42:59.118 --> 43:00.703
Donna, what's the matter?

43:00.786 --> 43:02.997
I tried to tell you,
and you guys didn't believe me!

43:03.080 --> 43:03.998
Look at this letter.

43:04.081 --> 43:05.582
{\an1}DONNA:
Look at the date!

43:06.583 --> 43:08.669
Slan was released
two weeks ago.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.379
That's when it all started.

43:11.797 --> 43:14.341
He's out.
