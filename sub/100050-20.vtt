00:01.668 --> 00:03.503
BOWERS:
So, you can see that Sheldon
has a baby tooth

00:03.503 --> 00:05.964
that never fell out.
Is that a problem?

00:05.964 --> 00:08.133
Well, it's gonna keep the adult
tooth from coming down, and...

00:08.133 --> 00:09.676
it's gonna need to be extracted.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.512
Oh, he is not gonna be happy
about that.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.181
No, he is not.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.642
Are you sure we can't
just wait this thing out?

00:16.642 --> 00:18.310
It's gonna cause all the other
teeth around it to come in

00:18.310 --> 00:21.146
crooked and, well, you know,
braces can be expensive.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.648
(groans)

00:22.648 --> 00:25.651
He is gonna freak out
about the pain

00:25.651 --> 00:27.819
and the needle and the blood.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.404
Yeah, I wouldn't mention
that stuff when you tell him.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.531
Uh, can't you tell him?

00:31.531 --> 00:33.033
(laughs)
I'm not gonna tell him.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.535
But you're his doctor.
And you're his mommy.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.704
Which means that I have to deal
with him all the time.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.706
Help me out here.
No.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.376
Okay. Can we
tell him together?

00:42.376 --> 00:43.502
No.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.047
All right.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.884
What if I put your
business card, free of charge,

00:50.884 --> 00:54.054
in the next church newsletter?

00:55.430 --> 00:58.725
So, Sheldon,
little bit of dental news.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.519
You have a baby tooth

01:00.519 --> 01:01.895
that never fell out.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.523
Neat. Even my teeth
are stubborn.

01:04.523 --> 01:09.361
Anyway, in order for your teeth
to come in straight,

01:09.361 --> 01:12.197
Dr. Bowers is gonna
need to pull it out.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.491
Why didn't I hear this
from him?

01:14.491 --> 01:16.201
I had the same question.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.704
But a tooth extraction
is a major procedure.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.205
Not necessarily.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.082
Will there be blood?

01:22.082 --> 01:22.624
A little.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.667
Will there be a needle?

01:23.667 --> 01:25.043
Maybe, but you won't feel it,

01:25.043 --> 01:26.586
'cause he's gonna
put you under first.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.046
Put me under? With drugs?

01:28.046 --> 01:29.464
That's even more dangerous.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.675
Sheldon, lots of people
get their teeth pulled.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.051
It's not a big deal.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.971
Stop enjoying this.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.639
Sorry.
No, you're not.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.808
No, I'm not.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.605

02:02.205 --> 02:04.875
This is not exactly the
date night I'd envisioned

02:04.875 --> 02:07.002
when I was shaving my legs.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.170
I'm almost done.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.421
We're elderly, you know?

02:09.421 --> 02:11.465
If anything,
dinner should be early.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.716
Well, I'll tell you what,
when I'm finished,

02:12.716 --> 02:15.969
I am gonna whisk you off
to the finest--

02:15.969 --> 02:18.972
and the only--
Chinese food place in town.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.850
Ying's? Their nachos are weird.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.852
I don't know,
it's not a bad idea

02:23.852 --> 02:27.522
to maybe venture out of Medford
once in a while.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.983
Even better, why don't we
go away for the weekend?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.401
Uh, come on--
You know how hard it is

02:31.401 --> 02:32.736
for me to get out of the store.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.780
What's the point
of being the boss

02:34.780 --> 02:36.865
if you can't get somebody else
to do your work for you?

02:36.865 --> 02:40.702
Uh, I might be able to leave
Georgie in charge.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.329
My grandson?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.164
That'd be the one.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.000
I want to go, so I'm just gonna
say "good idea."

02:47.000 --> 02:48.168
(chuckles)

02:48.168 --> 02:49.544
(both laugh)

02:52.381 --> 02:55.050
Hi, Sheldon,
what can I do for you?

02:55.050 --> 02:58.053
Do you have any books or videos
on the Lamaze technique?

02:58.053 --> 03:00.597
Uh-oh. Georgie get
that girl pregnant?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.391
It's for me.
I need to have a tooth pulled,

03:02.391 --> 03:04.810
and I'd like to do it without
putting my brain on drugs.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.561
Okay.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.897
I've seen that commercial
with the egg in the frying pan.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.899
Very effective.
Well,

03:10.899 --> 03:13.318
since this is a high school,
we don't have material

03:13.318 --> 03:15.028
about giving birth
on the shelves.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.363
But...

03:16.363 --> 03:18.532
since this is a high school,

03:18.532 --> 03:23.078
I keep a few things here
under the counter.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.746
Excellent.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.997
And I'll let my brother know,

03:25.997 --> 03:28.500
in case he gets himself
in a pickle.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.090
(exhaling rhythmically)

03:35.090 --> 03:37.300
You're having a tooth pulled,
not having a baby.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.637
If it can work for getting
an eight-pound human

03:40.637 --> 03:43.598
through a birth canal,
it can work for a tiny tooth.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.268
Eight pounds?
I'm never having kids.

03:46.268 --> 03:49.062
ADULT SHELDON:
Fun fact: she ended up
having four.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.774
And if I do, I'm taking
any drugs they'll give me.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.818
ADULT SHELDON:
That part was true.

03:54.818 --> 03:55.986
(radio playing indistinctly)

03:55.986 --> 03:57.487
Hey, Georgie.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.449
I'm thinking about
taking your meemaw away

04:00.449 --> 04:01.783
for this weekend.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.035
Okay. You have my blessing.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.121
Thank you.
And I was wondering, maybe,

04:06.121 --> 04:08.457
if you'd look
after the store while I'm gone.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.459
You saying I'm the manager?

04:10.459 --> 04:13.128
No, I-I'm saying I want you
to look after the store

04:13.128 --> 04:14.796
while I'm gone.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.840
But in a managerial capacity.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.425
(sighs)

04:18.425 --> 04:20.135
You think you can handle it?

04:20.135 --> 04:21.970
Yes, sir. I will make you proud.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.138
Great.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.264
Can I fire people?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.474
No.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.476
Can I get paid more?
No.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.644
Can I at least change the music
we play here?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.646
What's wrong with the music
we play here?

04:31.646 --> 04:34.357
Nothing, it's just
kind of grandpa music.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.277
Well, how is this
"grandpa music"?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.904
Do you listen to it?

04:38.904 --> 04:40.155
Yeah.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.699
Do you have grandchildren?
Yeah.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.618
Do you see where I'm going
with this?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.664
Okay, Sheldon, you ready?

04:49.664 --> 04:50.707
Not really.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.083
Yeah, that makes two of us.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.335
Why don't you guys come on back?

04:53.335 --> 04:55.337
You know what?
I'm just gonna stay here.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.506
Um, you don't need me
getting in your way.

04:57.506 --> 04:58.798
Oh, it's no trouble at all.
Come on.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.175
I've got my crochet.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.427
You're coming.
Fine.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.560
So, you don't need to worry
about needles

05:10.560 --> 05:12.145
'cause we're gonna put you under
for the procedure.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.065
No, thank you. There are risks
associated with anesthesia.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.691
Feel free to jump in.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.276
Are there any other options?

05:18.276 --> 05:19.486
Well, he could stay awake
for it, but we'd have

05:19.486 --> 05:20.654
to give him novocaine.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.489
No needles. Just pull the tooth.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.950
Okay. Just so you know...
(exhaling rhythmically)

05:24.950 --> 05:26.660
I'm gonna be using this.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.455
(loud, echoing banging)

05:30.455 --> 05:31.957
Drugs, please.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.336
You go to this casino often?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.004
Kind of.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.257
So don't be surprised
if everybody knows my name,

05:40.257 --> 05:43.843
how I take my whiskey
and the color of my lucky bra.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.095
Purple.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.721
No, that's my "get lucky" bra.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.014
(laughs)

05:48.014 --> 05:51.351
So, what are you into?
Craps, roulette?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.562
Well, not much of a gambler.

05:53.562 --> 05:58.900
You just left Georgie in charge
of your store, so... disagree.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.737
Mm, he's a lot smarter
than you think.

06:02.737 --> 06:06.241
Maybe you're not
as smart as I think.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.869
Well, if you like me just for
my body, I'm okay with that.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.621
(laughs)

06:13.623 --> 06:16.876
♪ If you could hear me think,
this is what I'd say... ♪

06:16.876 --> 06:19.588
There you go. I hope you enjoyed
your shopping experience.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.047
I did.
I'd let the
manager know,

06:21.047 --> 06:23.550
but he already does,
'cause it's me.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.052
I'll take it.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.430
It's been a pleasure
to serve you.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.390
You might want to slow down.
We don't have a license

06:30.390 --> 06:32.934
to sell guns in here.
(laughs softly)

06:32.934 --> 06:35.103
Just kidding, it's Texas.
We got them in the back.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.231
Okay, Sheldon,
we're gonna put the mask on.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.192
Now you just breathe normally
and count back from 100.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.569
But counting back from 100

06:42.569 --> 06:45.071
isn't complex enough
to occupy my mind.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.865
You're up again.

06:46.865 --> 06:51.036
Why don't you think
of something more sciencey?

06:51.036 --> 06:52.537
Like counting pi.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.414
That's a thing, right? Pi?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.292
I can't count pi,
it's an irrational number.

06:57.292 --> 07:00.253
But I can embrace the spirit
of your proposal and calculate

07:00.253 --> 07:01.630
the matrix coefficients

07:01.630 --> 07:03.798
necessary
for a unified field theory.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.050
Do that. Hit it.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.596
(slurring): Of the four
fundamental forces,

07:09.596 --> 07:14.893
the most difficult to unify
is gravity because...

07:14.893 --> 07:16.269
(exhales)
Oh, thank God.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.939
(carnival music playing)

07:23.109 --> 07:24.694
STURGIS:
Step right up.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.448
Step right up

07:28.448 --> 07:32.035
for your chance to meet Thoth!

07:32.035 --> 07:35.955
The Egyptian god
of knowledge.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.209
He has all the answers.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.462
No question too big

07:42.462 --> 07:44.047
or small.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.424
Hello, young man.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.761
Do you have a question
you'd like to pose?

07:49.761 --> 07:52.472
I do, but nobody
in the history of science

07:52.472 --> 07:54.140
has ever been able to answer it.

07:54.140 --> 07:59.771
(laughs): Well, they haven't
asked the great god Thoth!

08:00.980 --> 08:04.484
Right this way!

08:16.663 --> 08:18.415
Ask your question.

08:18.415 --> 08:22.001
Do you really possess
all knowledge?

08:22.001 --> 08:24.629
You only get one question, kid.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.631
You want that to be it?

08:26.631 --> 08:28.633
Oh. No.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.469
How can I unify
the four fundamental forces

08:31.469 --> 08:32.971
of the universe?

08:32.971 --> 08:34.973
Now we're talking.

08:34.973 --> 08:38.893
In order to unify gravity,
you must first understand

08:38.893 --> 08:41.479
that it is a distortion
of space-time.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.065
(mumbling):
Gravity. Of course.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.985
He even talks in his sleep.
Why am I not surprised?

08:46.985 --> 08:47.944
(plastic clacking)

08:49.988 --> 08:52.073
Didn't feel it at all.
That's how good this helmet is.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.075
Want to take a whack?

08:54.075 --> 08:56.911
Try it on.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.413
I'll be up front when
you're ready to buy it.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.253
Oh, no.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.341
(exhales)
Damn it.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.510
(roulette wheel spinning)

09:12.510 --> 09:14.220
MEEMAW:
26 for the twins'

09:14.220 --> 09:19.476
birthday, three for Georgie
and Mary wouldn't like it

09:19.476 --> 09:23.563
if I used her birthday
for gambling, so 13 for her.

09:23.563 --> 09:27.150
All right. For my grandson's
birthday, I'm gonna go black,

09:27.150 --> 09:29.402
'cause I don't remember.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.278
No more bets.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.407
26 black.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.576
(Meemaw whoops)
Whoa! Yep! Hey-ah!

09:36.576 --> 09:38.244
Hooray for the grandkids!

09:38.244 --> 09:40.872
Whenever the hell
they were born!
(laughs)

09:40.872 --> 09:41.915
You want to go to the bar?

09:41.915 --> 09:42.749
No, we've hit.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.250
We gotta ride this out.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.044
CROUPIER:
Double zero.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.213
Ride's over.
To the bar!

09:50.089 --> 09:52.091
(moans softly)
(TV playing indistinctly)

09:54.469 --> 09:55.762
(muffled):
Where am I?

09:55.762 --> 09:58.139
Oh, you died.
You're a ghost now.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.599
What?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.434
MARY:
Look who's awake.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.603
How are you feelin'?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.855
I had a dream.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.942
I solved a unified field theory.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.985
Well, good for you.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.987
But I can't remember it.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.197
Hmm.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.199
Well, you were
mumblin' something

10:16.199 --> 10:18.451
about gravity and forces.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.912
You need to be more specific.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.289
Shelly, you weren't makin'
much sense.

10:23.289 --> 10:27.669
Mother, a unified field theory
is the holy grail of physics.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.879
Solving it would be
the greatest breakthrough

10:29.879 --> 10:31.923
in the history of science.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.091
MISSY:
And you forgot it.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.092
That's funny.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.224
Hello, Dr. Bowers,
it's Sheldon Cooper.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.935
I need you to administer
more anesthesia to me.

10:43.935 --> 10:46.062
No, I don't have
a dental problem.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.690
I need to reenter a trancelike
state so I can communicate

10:48.690 --> 10:50.149
with Thoth,
the god of knowledge.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.945
I would argue that the greatest
discovery in physics

10:53.945 --> 10:56.239
is worth losing
your dental license.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.866
Well, it's not
my fault you let them

10:57.866 --> 10:59.117
publish your home phone number.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.326
(line clicks, dial tone drones)

11:00.326 --> 11:03.079
Well, this is
my favorite table here.

11:03.079 --> 11:07.542
Well, sure, every time
you put down money, you win.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.879
Oh, this is nice.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.633
You know, I really don't get
away from the store enough.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.804
How come you're still
workin' at your age?

11:19.804 --> 11:20.847
What do you mean "my age"?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.348
I mean you're old.
(laughs)

11:22.348 --> 11:23.850
I'm not old.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.977
Well, I'm old and
you're older than me.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.104
Yeah, that's true.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.689
But we make it
look good though.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.357
You don't want
to be that guy

11:31.357 --> 11:33.860
that just works
till he drops dead.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.195
I mean, maybe you
should retire.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.031
Have a little fun.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.532
Well, I'm here with you.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.702
That's a good start,
'cause I'm fun.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.370
Oh, man, you sure
as hell are.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.580
(both laugh)

11:47.916 --> 11:49.792
Hey, you know
what'd be fun?

11:49.792 --> 11:52.211
New Orleans is just
an hour away from here.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.547
Oh, I like where
this is headed.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.884
And they got
themselves a 24-hour

11:57.884 --> 12:00.261
wedding chapel.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.971
What?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.224
(laughs):
No!

12:05.224 --> 12:06.559
What do you mean "no"?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.645
We're good together
and we're both old.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.271
That's what you said.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.232
We-we haven't even
said "I love you" yet!

12:13.232 --> 12:14.275
All right, fine.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.818
I love you.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.867
You... you're not gonna
say anything back?

12:22.867 --> 12:24.869
Not under these
circumstances!

12:28.915 --> 12:31.000
(mutters):
Ah, goddang it.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.420
Dale?!

12:37.090 --> 12:38.841
GEORGE JR.:
I'd like to report

12:38.841 --> 12:41.260
a robbery.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.763
Well, before I tell you my name,
is there any way we can do this

12:43.763 --> 12:47.266
where the owner of the store
don't find out?

12:47.266 --> 12:51.187
Because he left me in charge
and I really screwed up.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.940
At least $400.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.692
I know it's a lot.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.318
That's why I said I screwed up.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.864
I got to think about this.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.534
I-I'll call you back.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.911
ADULT SHELDON:
If I was going to recapture
my insight

13:06.911 --> 13:10.331
into a unified field theory,
I needed to find a way

13:10.331 --> 13:14.168
to put myself back into an
altered state of consciousness.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.129
Native Americans would

13:16.129 --> 13:19.215
sit in sweat lodges
for hours to achieve this.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.969
I lasted a minute and a half.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.929
Self-hypnosis is another means

13:24.929 --> 13:27.724
of bringing stillness
to the mind.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.143
(screams)

13:30.143 --> 13:32.103
When it isn't giving you
a heart attack!

13:32.103 --> 13:34.939
The whirling dervishes
of Central Asia

13:34.939 --> 13:36.733
employ a repetitive
spinning technique

13:36.733 --> 13:40.153
to achieve a trancelike state.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.155
(retches)

13:44.574 --> 13:46.576
(TV playing indistinctly)

13:52.623 --> 13:54.292
You didn't have to storm off.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.838
You're being childish.

14:00.298 --> 14:01.507
So I don't want to get married.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.842
It's nothing personal.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.012
Well, it feels personal.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.013
I'm not rejecting you.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.639
I'm rejecting marriage.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.101
If it helps,
it's not the first proposal

14:12.101 --> 14:13.352
I've turned down.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.980
How the hell does that help?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.357
After everything that I've done

14:18.357 --> 14:20.485
for you and your family!

14:20.485 --> 14:23.279
You give my grandson a job,
so I'm supposed to marry you?

14:23.279 --> 14:26.866
Well, you can forget
I even asked.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.582
ADULT SHELDON:
After my other attempts
to return to the trancelike

14:34.582 --> 14:37.543
state of anesthesia failed,
I turned to something

14:37.543 --> 14:41.172
Nancy Reagan herself told me
to "just say no" to.

14:41.172 --> 14:44.509
My mind-altering
substance of choice was...

14:44.509 --> 14:46.010
chamomile tea.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.387
But not your grandma's
chamomile tea.

14:48.387 --> 14:52.642
A highly concentrated super
chamomile of my own making.

14:52.642 --> 14:57.063
All the relaxing power
of 30 cups of chamomile tea

14:57.063 --> 14:59.232
packed into a teaspoon

14:59.232 --> 15:01.484
of calming sludge.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.361
Sorry, Mrs. Reagan.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.547
(sighs)

15:25.341 --> 15:27.802
Okay, grand unified
field theory,

15:27.802 --> 15:29.804
here I come.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.353
(groaning)

15:46.946 --> 15:49.365
This isn't working.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.160
MAN:
I disagree.

15:52.160 --> 15:56.664
Seems to be working
fine and dandy.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.292
Mr. Einstein?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.210
I'm very excited
to talk to you,

16:01.210 --> 16:02.587
but I was
hoping to hear

16:02.587 --> 16:04.589
from Thoth, the Egyptian
god of knowledge,

16:04.589 --> 16:07.675
so he could teach me the grand
unified field theory again.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.094
Ooh, the grand
unified field theory!

16:10.094 --> 16:12.722
Well, la-di-da.

16:12.722 --> 16:16.142
He told it to me in a dream,
but I can't remember.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.061
All right,
hang on.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.313
Where is the fun
in finding

16:20.313 --> 16:22.648
things out if some joker
with a bird head

16:22.648 --> 16:24.775
just tells you the answer?

16:24.775 --> 16:28.738
But a grand unified field theory
would explain the universe.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.615
Answers are
all well and good,

16:30.615 --> 16:33.534
but a real scientist loves
the thrill of the chase.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.785
Am I right, Hawking?

16:34.785 --> 16:36.120
I would agree.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.956
I do also enjoy the thrill

16:38.956 --> 16:41.876
of rolling over bubble wrap
with my chair.

16:41.876 --> 16:45.463
It-it is fun to pop
that stuff, isn't it?

16:45.463 --> 16:48.132
So fun.
But what if I never
figure it out?

16:48.132 --> 16:49.717
I never did

16:49.717 --> 16:52.136
and my scientific career
is nothing to sneeze at.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.055
Same here.
Agreed.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.057
Uh, don't-don't look at me.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.392
I-I drive a Yugo.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.519
So none of you can help me?

17:00.519 --> 17:02.230
I believe I can.

17:02.230 --> 17:05.858
Sheldon, if I was offered
a choice between all

17:05.858 --> 17:08.903
the knowledge of the universe
or the endless pursuit of it,

17:08.903 --> 17:11.447
I would choose the pursuit.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.992
That's very insightful.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.452
Hold it, hold it--
he didn't come up with that!

17:16.452 --> 17:18.829
He stole it
from Gotthold Lessing.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.499
Who's-who's Gotthold Lessing?

17:21.499 --> 17:24.794
He's an 18th century
German philosopher.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.379
Now do you mind?

17:26.379 --> 17:29.799
We girls are trying to have
some fun over here.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.467
Apologies.
Sorry,
Cyndi Lauper.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.677
Our bad.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.428
I-I like fun.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.890
ADULT SHELDON:
While I made my peace

17:37.890 --> 17:40.851
with not having the solution
to a unified field theory,

17:40.851 --> 17:42.979
my intestines
did not make peace

17:42.979 --> 17:45.398
with concentrated
chamomile syrup.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.024
Oh, dear.

17:47.024 --> 17:50.444
Bathroom emergency!
Bathroom emergency!

17:58.119 --> 17:59.453
What the hell?

18:00.496 --> 18:01.998
I locked this.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.167
Who's here?

18:05.167 --> 18:07.336
I'll call the cops!

18:07.336 --> 18:08.921
It's just me.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.507
Why you back so soon?

18:11.507 --> 18:12.967
None of your business.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.595
How'd it go yesterday?

18:15.595 --> 18:17.013
It was good.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.848
Until it wasn't.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.266
What do you mean?

18:20.266 --> 18:23.227
I was helping a customer,

18:23.227 --> 18:25.521
and I guess I forgot
to close the register,

18:25.521 --> 18:29.317
'cause when I got back to it,
all the money was gone.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.818
Are you kidding me?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.028
I screwed up.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.362
Did you call the police?

18:33.362 --> 18:34.989
I didn't want
to get them involved.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.575
But I was gonna make it right.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.037
Here, take it.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.583
So we good?

18:46.542 --> 18:48.544
You're fired.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.212
R-Really?

18:50.212 --> 18:53.215
Get out of my store now.
