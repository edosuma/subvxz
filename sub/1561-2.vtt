00:01.835 --> 00:03.633
(narrator)
Previously on "Constantine.."

00:03.836 --> 00:05.259
(John)
My name is John Constantine.

00:05.464 --> 00:07.137
(Dr. Huntoon)
"Exorcist, demonologist

00:07.341 --> 00:09.844
and master of the dark arts?"

00:10.010 --> 00:11.262
(Manny)
There's a darkness rising, John.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.767
People can sense
what's on the way.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.598
(Chas)
It's happening everywhere.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.228
(Manny) If you figure out
what we're up against

00:16.433 --> 00:18.606
I will use that knowledge
to save lives.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.609
- What about my life, eh?
- 'You damned a girl to hell.'

00:21.813 --> 00:24.692
And along with her, your soul.
At least for a moment, anyway.

00:24.900 --> 00:25.947
Are you suggesting that
it's not too late

00:26.151 --> 00:27.323
for me to save my soul?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.121
That mean
you're going to help us?

00:29.321 --> 00:31.244
(John) I walk my path alone.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.291
Because, let's be honest

00:33.492 --> 00:35.995
who would be crazy enough
to walk it with me?

00:37.579 --> 00:39.877
[whistle blows]

00:40.040 --> 00:42.418
[indistinct chatter]

00:49.383 --> 00:50.851
[door shuts]

00:57.140 --> 00:59.188
Bad clay?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.145
[grunts]

01:01.353 --> 01:03.151
Lannis?

01:03.355 --> 01:05.403
Three more on my shift
threatened to quit today.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.611
Candy asses.

01:08.819 --> 01:09.866
They still hearing the sounds?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.788
'Don't you start in, too.'

01:11.989 --> 01:13.832
They put me in charge
of a bunch of Johnny Newcomes

01:14.032 --> 01:15.830
barely old enough to shave.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.537
There's nothing down
in that mine for 'em to hear.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.419
Why don't you go on
and get yourself cleaned up.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.130
I'll have your dinner ready
when you get out.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.518
I'm hungry now.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.471
It's not ready.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.817
[liquor sloshing]

01:45.439 --> 01:46.861
[sighs]

02:20.807 --> 02:22.650
[grunts]

02:25.270 --> 02:26.237
[creaking]

02:26.438 --> 02:28.065
'What the hell?'

02:35.781 --> 02:37.533
[screaming]

02:41.411 --> 02:43.789
[theme music]

02:50.128 --> 02:52.506
[screaming]

03:04.601 --> 03:08.151
- 'Uh, working on your skills?'
- Just one. Patience.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.404
Where the bloody hell
have you been?

03:11.608 --> 03:13.155
I had to wait
till the daily double.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.078
It was your only pick
that paid off.

03:19.574 --> 03:22.578
Capnomancy isn't an exact magic.

03:22.786 --> 03:26.256
Divining the future through
the movements of rising smoke

03:26.456 --> 03:28.254
it's a tricky business.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.211
I would think
you'd be an expert.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.888
Saddle up.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.761
We're heading to Pennsylvania.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.057
'Now, look at the map.'

03:36.258 --> 03:37.851
(Chas)
'One of the drops is wet. Mmm.'

03:38.051 --> 03:41.681
Our destination
is the tiny town of Heddwich.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.892
According to local papers,
a mining boss

03:45.100 --> 03:46.602
was just flash-fried
in his shower.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.278
Well, you're on your own.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.400
Pennsylvania?

03:49.604 --> 03:51.948
The succubus on a freight train?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.822
That warrant still stands?

03:54.025 --> 03:55.197
Funny what a long memory
the law has

03:55.402 --> 03:56.745
when it comes to train
derailments.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.746
[horn blowing]

04:02.325 --> 04:03.201
[instrumental music]

04:03.410 --> 04:05.754
[church bell ringing]

04:27.809 --> 04:30.153
Who are you?

04:31.688 --> 04:35.158
You're really starting
to piss me off.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.702
[music continues]

04:52.083 --> 04:54.506
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.382
Oh. Well, the apologies
are all mine, luv.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.638
Let's, uh, get you sorted, yeah?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.515
If there's one thing
I know my way around

05:02.719 --> 05:05.347
it's rubbish.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.058
It's... you. You're you.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.940
[chuckles]
That observation always ends

05:11.144 --> 05:14.318
in the same way,
and it's never in my favor.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.651
I dream about you.

05:16.858 --> 05:21.113
I... was starting to believe
you weren't real.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.291
'Who are you?'

05:24.491 --> 05:26.994
[chuckles]

05:27.202 --> 05:30.126
Some kind of carnival
quick-draw artist, are we?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.298
Perched and peeking in a window.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.297
Scratch out the visage
of some poor lonely sod

05:34.501 --> 05:37.926
and then bump into him as if
you're his long-lost lover.

05:38.129 --> 05:41.178
Tongue in his ear,
hand in his pocket, I bet.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.056
It's a nice play, luv, but
I think I'll sit this one out.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.981
No. It's the dirty blond hair.
The curled lip.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.807
- The bad posture.
- I have excellent posture.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.019
- I've seen it all.
- Well, not well, apparently.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.535
There.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.361
Eyes are much darker
than this one.

06:01.570 --> 06:05.120
No. I don't know who you are.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.996
Please.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.918
(0K3)!-

06:09.119 --> 06:12.043
You want answers.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.796
One artist to another.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.257
In light..

06:18.461 --> 06:20.088
'...l always find mine.'

06:34.436 --> 06:36.438
"John Constantine."

06:45.363 --> 06:47.240
Stout.

06:50.035 --> 06:53.505
That kind of irony
is hard to ignore, isn't it?

06:53.705 --> 06:56.003
The town's symbol
being a dragon and..

06:56.207 --> 06:58.926
This sorry soul being
burned alive.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.510
So what's your take
on what happened?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.216
Fire through the pipes?
It's rare.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.767
But it happens in mining towns.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.514
Well, maybe if there's fracking.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.813
But isn't this the land
of hard rock mining?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.230
What do you know about it?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.684
Grew up in Liverpool, mate.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.520
Breathed in more coal dust
than fresh air as a lad.

07:16.728 --> 07:17.570
Lannis!

07:17.771 --> 07:19.523
(all) Hean

07:19.731 --> 07:21.608
Must've been a good bloke.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.160
Lannis was a bastard.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.159
But they closed the mine
for the day.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.785
Fellas around here
don't need an invitation

07:27.989 --> 07:29.161
to get a skinful.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.869
(male #1)
'Another pitcher, Charlie.'

07:32.077 --> 07:35.627
Have you considered actual
dragons as the guilty party?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.252
There's no natural explanation
of what happened

07:37.457 --> 07:38.709
to poor Lannis, is there?

07:38.917 --> 07:39.759
You got that right.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.802
But it weren't no dragon

07:41.002 --> 07:43.130
that took Lannis and the others.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.214
- The others?
- Nine others.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.720
All in the last year.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.474
They died like this bloke?

07:49.678 --> 07:51.396
Mining accidents.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.690
'Some of the boys are saying
we dug a little too deep.'

07:53.890 --> 07:54.937
We knocked on the door of hell

07:55.141 --> 07:57.143
and now hell is knocking back.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.229
- Someone heard knocking?
- Yeah.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.860
Down in that godforsaken tunnel.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.736
[instrumental music]

08:30.093 --> 08:31.470
(male #2) 'Whoa!'

09:01.416 --> 09:03.794
[intense music]

09:33.448 --> 09:35.200
[grunts]

09:44.709 --> 09:46.552
[loud knocking]

09:49.589 --> 09:52.308
[rumbling]

09:52.509 --> 09:54.853
[panting]

09:58.890 --> 10:00.107
[groans loudly]

10:05.772 --> 10:08.150
[indistinct chatter]

10:52.235 --> 10:54.613
[intense music]

11:20.930 --> 11:22.352
(female #1)
'Find what you're looking for?'

11:22.557 --> 11:25.811
[sighs] As a matter of fact, no.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.068
My name's John Constantine.
Philly Enquirer.

11:29.272 --> 11:32.071
I didn't notice you out front
with all the others.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.153
I've been hiding back here.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.160
My husband's death
hit me very hard.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.163
You've got some, uh, coal there.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.960
'On your arm.'

11:43.161 --> 11:44.333
Oh.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.790
You can't escape it around here.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.717
The soot. The grime.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.888
Seeps into every pore and fiber.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.636
Uh, this doesn't
really make sense, does it?

11:55.840 --> 11:58.184
'And if you don't mind
me asking'

11:58.384 --> 11:59.727
what do you think happened?

11:59.928 --> 12:03.432
Does it really matter?
Lannis is gone.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.267
Well, if you help me,
I might write a story

12:05.475 --> 12:06.943
that celebrates his life.

12:07.143 --> 12:11.649
Because our life
was just one big celebration.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.405
Sorry.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.530
You're sweet.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.582
You know, I've heard rumors
that there's..

12:21.783 --> 12:25.538
Something not natural
down in that mine.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.543
'Your husband
ever talk about it?'

12:27.747 --> 12:29.215
You want a story?

12:29.415 --> 12:30.291
Yeah.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.004
Okay. I have one for you.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.180
It's about a Romani girl.

12:36.381 --> 12:41.137
She got letters from a man,
a rich man..

12:41.344 --> 12:44.848
Who wanted to marry her.
Make her his queen.

12:46.140 --> 12:49.815
Said he was the captain
of industry.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.693
Failed to mention it was coal.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.117
Now, will that story
sell papers?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.240
We can talk at a later date.
It's fine.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.993
Why?

13:01.197 --> 13:03.916
I'm free now.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.084
Uh..

13:11.416 --> 13:12.542
Look, you're a lovely bird
and everything...

13:12.750 --> 13:13.967
- Out.
- But I'm not being..

13:14.127 --> 13:15.504
- Out!
- Alright, I'm going.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.180
Alright. I'm leaving.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.303
- Get out.
- I'm going.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.305
- I want you gone.
- Alright, alright, I'm going.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.476
There's no need
to cause a fuss, right?

13:22.677 --> 13:23.849
Someone get him out.
I want him out.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.556
Who is this?

13:26.764 --> 13:28.892
He says he's a reporter.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.148
- Yeah.
- Hey. Hey.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.572
Hey! Nobody messes
with my people.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.736
What is it you want here?

13:39.944 --> 13:43.994
It's as the lady said,
I'm a reporter.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.876
Check him.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.625
[grunting]

13:52.999 --> 13:55.001
[John chuckling]

13:57.045 --> 13:58.217
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

13:58.421 --> 14:02.051
- Oh.
- Who the hell are you?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.726
I take it you're the boss
of the mine.

14:03.926 --> 14:07.271
Yes. I'm the president
of the NorPenn Mining Company.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.521
You're upsetting the widow
of one of my respected men.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.318
We both know that's not true.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.861
Take it easy, Thad.

14:14.062 --> 14:17.157
He might be with Environmental
Protection.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.859
This one? No chance.

14:19.067 --> 14:22.571
Oh, in a way, your associate
there is not wrong.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.249
You've got a not-so-natural
disaster down in that mine.

14:26.449 --> 14:29.123
You know it and I know it.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.705
What I can't figure out
is why it's come above ground

14:31.913 --> 14:35.008
to kill one of your men.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.051
You listen to me.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.503
I don't know what sleazy tabloid

14:38.711 --> 14:40.554
you write for, but I got
my hands filled here

14:40.755 --> 14:42.382
with scared miners.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.017
The biggest threat to them
are parasites like you spreading

14:45.218 --> 14:47.186
panic and fear.

14:48.805 --> 14:52.025
You heard it as well,
didn't you?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.812
The knocking.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.774
Go home.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.294
[exhales]

15:24.132 --> 15:26.226
[chuckling sigh]

15:27.218 --> 15:28.845
Well, I'll give you this..

15:29.053 --> 15:31.727
You are persistent.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.274
The honeymoon suite?

15:33.474 --> 15:35.602
I always get
the honeymoon suite.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.528
Lots of extra space.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.072
'There's a good energy to it.'

15:40.273 --> 15:41.741
(Zed) 'You dropped this.'

15:46.904 --> 15:48.451
There was 90 quid in there.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.660
You must have dropped that, too.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.415
You know, I described you
to the very nice young man

15:53.619 --> 15:55.667
at the front desk, and he said

15:55.872 --> 15:59.217
you're registered
under the name of, um, Caligari.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.511
Bud Caligari.

16:01.711 --> 16:04.555
But your ID
and the boarding pass

16:04.755 --> 16:05.927
I found in the trash can

16:06.132 --> 16:07.759
says your name
is John Constantine.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.435
The rubbish again?

16:09.635 --> 16:12.479
You're a girl
after my own heart... Zed.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.639
How do you know my name?

16:13.848 --> 16:15.270
Credit card receipt
from your trash.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.727
So I did make an impression.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.527
Well, call me balmy,
but I like to know

16:18.728 --> 16:19.570
who's stalking me.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.147
I'm not stalking you.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.449
You know, you've just been
in my head for months.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.276
And then, you know,
all of a sudden, you're here?

16:25.485 --> 16:26.452
Don't you want to know why?

16:26.652 --> 16:27.494
I don't seek answers
to questions

16:27.653 --> 16:28.529
that needn't be asked.

16:28.738 --> 16:29.785
Well, I do.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.831
I don't know anything about you

16:30.990 --> 16:31.957
but I feel like I should.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.375
Running into each other today

16:33.576 --> 16:34.623
that's destiny.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.079
Well, if it's destiny that
you're after

16:36.287 --> 16:37.664
then maybe you should take
that 90 quid

16:37.872 --> 16:39.044
and put it on the lottery.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.465
You mean something to me.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.667
You know, and maybe

16:41.876 --> 16:43.093
I mean something to you, too.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.763
A reason to elevate my personal
security.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.637
I have visions I can't control.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.515
And sometimes, feelings.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.598
Listen, Zed..

16:54.805 --> 16:56.648
I'm starting to like you.
A little bit.

16:56.849 --> 16:57.975
But not enough to let you stay

16:58.184 --> 16:59.811
so if you don't mind,
would you..

17:01.229 --> 17:03.732
What is that?

17:03.940 --> 17:06.193
Loneliness.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.821
Pain.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.700
Desperation.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.875
These things motivate you.

17:16.493 --> 17:19.794
What kind of person
is motivated by these things?

17:23.334 --> 17:26.929
So much guilt, John Constantine.

17:32.009 --> 17:36.059
[short chuckle] Clairsentient.

17:36.264 --> 17:39.063
Or maybe just a good guesser.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.110
(0K3)!-

17:41.310 --> 17:43.529
You want answers?

17:43.729 --> 17:45.106
Let's see what you got.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.658
Park it.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.031
You'll do everything I say,
you understand?

17:50.236 --> 17:52.238
- Yes.
- Close your eyes.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.125
I want you to see an image
in your mind.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.168
It's a total whiteout.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.167
Absorbing all sound

18:00.371 --> 18:05.468
except for the sound
of my voice.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.297
Are you with me?

18:09.505 --> 18:12.475
Good.

18:12.675 --> 18:15.269
There's a white dove
lost in the snowstorm.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.437
You need to save it.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.608
Hold out your hand.
Open your senses.

18:21.809 --> 18:25.439
And let the dove come to you..

18:25.646 --> 18:27.068
Now.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.489
[screaming]

18:33.487 --> 18:35.581
Zed.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.748
Zed!

18:36.949 --> 18:39.668
[Zed sobbing]

18:39.869 --> 18:41.917
Zed. Zed.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.964
[soft whimper]

18:44.165 --> 18:46.008
[exhales]

18:49.086 --> 18:51.259
You saw the fire.

18:53.090 --> 18:57.095
Was that the man
in town who was burning?

18:57.303 --> 19:00.102
What else did you see?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.775
A tall cross.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.567
Alright.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.614
You did a cracking job.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.691
Well, we're on to something,
you and me.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.993
I'm just gonna take
a quick change

19:16.155 --> 19:18.908
then we're gonna get to the
bottom of this, alright?

19:19.116 --> 19:20.868
Good.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.005
[door opens]

19:29.835 --> 19:31.337
John?

19:38.886 --> 19:41.856
John?

19:42.056 --> 19:43.774
Constantine!

20:10.626 --> 20:13.755
You'll make yourself known
if you know what's good for you.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.516
Really?

20:25.725 --> 20:28.695
- In a church?
- 'Sorry.'

20:28.894 --> 20:30.896
Don't apologize to me, mate.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.025
Put your clothes on, will you?

20:38.446 --> 20:40.790
- What's this business?
- Just a story.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.459
You know, meant to be scary.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.661
Tall man, no face.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.213
Follows you home,
peeps in your window.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.542
It's, it's not very original.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.427
Alright, go on. Run home.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.095
Alright.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.968
[intense music]

21:15.900 --> 21:18.278
[speaking in foreign language]

21:32.917 --> 21:35.295
[growling]

21:47.431 --> 21:48.899
[gasping]

21:51.769 --> 21:54.147
[panting]

22:11.956 --> 22:14.926
Have you seen an English man?
Who wears a trench coat?

22:15.125 --> 22:16.297
Stick you with a bar tab, too?

22:16.502 --> 22:17.628
[sighs]

22:17.837 --> 22:19.805
My advice, don't waste
yourself on that one.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.348
I don't have a choice.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.972
My son had that effect..

22:24.176 --> 22:26.429
When he was alive.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.015
Left behind clutches
of weepy girls

22:29.223 --> 22:32.477
who swore he was the only one
to give their life meaning.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.230
It's not like that.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.942
It's like that,
but not the way you think.

22:40.150 --> 22:44.030
I mean, it's just that...
he means something to me.

22:44.238 --> 22:45.080
I don't know what.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.123
Well, there was a time when

22:46.323 --> 22:47.825
people came to me for answers.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.413
But now our barkeep
hears more confessions

22:51.620 --> 22:53.748
in one day than I used to hear
in a month of Sundays.

22:53.956 --> 22:57.130
- 'Here you go.'
- Thank you.

23:00.004 --> 23:03.099
So, your son's the reason
you left your faith?

23:03.299 --> 23:06.052
I left the church
when the mine swallowed him.

23:08.846 --> 23:11.941
But I didn't leave my faith.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.769
Can't say I had much
to begin with.

23:14.977 --> 23:17.696
Faith is an unshakable
acceptance

23:17.897 --> 23:19.319
with no room for doubt.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.282
I'll never have that now.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.409
Cursed mine has seen to that.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.347
Hello, luv.
Is it mornin' already?

23:47.551 --> 23:49.645
You leave when I want you

23:49.845 --> 23:52.689
'and you're here when I don't.'

23:52.890 --> 23:55.894
I'll make it easy for you.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.523
Get out! Get up!

23:57.728 --> 24:00.277
- Oh, don't be that way, luv.
- I don't want you!

24:00.481 --> 24:03.109
I had to verify that
which you provided.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.285
A strict security protocol
is, in fact

24:05.486 --> 24:06.908
required in my business.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.865
I still don't know what you do.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.166
[sighs]

24:11.367 --> 24:13.870
What I am, as you have so..

24:14.078 --> 24:16.251
Mconventionally portrayed

24:16.455 --> 24:18.128
an exorcist, demonologist

24:18.332 --> 24:22.587
and occasional dabbler
in the dark arts.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.890
Now, the question is..

24:26.090 --> 24:27.012
Who are you?

24:27.216 --> 24:28.468
- I'm Zed.
- Right.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.553
Zed Martin.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.559
I found your three-month lease.

24:32.763 --> 24:36.233
So, what's a chica bonita
in her mid-20s

24:36.433 --> 24:39.562
doing slumming it in a one-horse
Welsh mining town

24:39.770 --> 24:41.693
in the middle of Pennsylvania?

24:41.897 --> 24:42.864
I travel a lot.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.443
Right.

24:45.651 --> 24:49.781
Well, there's only two types
of people who travel a lot.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.538
Those in the circus and..

24:52.741 --> 24:55.745
Those on the run, and curiously

24:55.953 --> 25:00.459
I'm not seeing any funny wigs
or face paint.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.419
I know what I'm running from.
Do you?

25:03.627 --> 25:06.676
You came to me, not the other
way around.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.053
You step into my world

25:09.258 --> 25:12.011
you'll be staring down demons,
devils and the like.

25:12.219 --> 25:15.314
Those things in your paintings
they're real.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.267
Yeah.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.228
It won't be bad memories

25:21.437 --> 25:23.940
nipping at your heels

25:24.148 --> 25:26.651
but the scourge of hell
gunning for your soul.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.829
And when the bell rings

25:30.029 --> 25:31.656
then you'd best be ready,
willing and able

25:31.864 --> 25:34.367
to answer with something
far more deadly

25:34.575 --> 25:37.328
than a charcoal pencil.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.880
Now, if you can handle that,
then we can talk business.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.833
If not, then we go
our separate ways

25:43.042 --> 25:46.546
and I never see your
pretty little face again.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.016
I ain't going nowhere.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.058
[alarm blaring]

25:56.263 --> 25:57.765
Is that what I think it is?

25:57.973 --> 25:59.395
'A mine collapse.'

25:59.600 --> 26:01.944
[indistinct shouting]

26:08.609 --> 26:11.203
Hey. Hey, what happened here?

26:13.238 --> 26:16.287
It all came down
right on top of us.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.915
Before it happened, knocking.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.041
Did you hear knocking?

26:20.245 --> 26:22.589
Yeah. It's in there.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.470
Alright. Thanks, mate.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.474
John!

26:46.563 --> 26:48.110
If Thad catches you here,
he's gonna make good...

26:48.273 --> 26:50.901
Men are dying in your mine.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.660
[sighs]

26:55.864 --> 26:58.117
Five years ago,
Heddwich was dead.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.409
'NorPenn saved this town.'

26:59.618 --> 27:00.961
They-they, they said the mine

27:01.161 --> 27:02.879
was tapped out,
but we gave it new life.

27:03.080 --> 27:06.050
Because you're a rogue
operation, digging unauthorized

27:06.250 --> 27:07.422
tunnels into regions
of the earth

27:07.626 --> 27:10.721
where mortal man
has no rightful place.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.719
It's true, isn't it?

27:12.923 --> 27:14.550
What the miners are saying?

27:16.760 --> 27:17.886
They hear sounds?

27:18.095 --> 27:20.518
And they'll keep on hearing them

27:20.722 --> 27:23.771
and people will keep dying

27:23.976 --> 27:26.729
until you shut down that mine.

27:26.937 --> 27:28.735
[clacking]

27:30.065 --> 27:31.362
What is that? What the hell?

27:31.567 --> 27:33.911
[water running]

27:37.531 --> 27:38.908
We need something to break
the windows now.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.834
Check under the seat.
What the hell?

27:41.034 --> 27:41.876
Damn it!

27:42.077 --> 27:44.421
[grunting]

27:46.999 --> 27:49.377
[groaning]

27:53.172 --> 27:54.674
[muffled groaning]

28:00.971 --> 28:03.349
[grunting]

28:12.983 --> 28:13.950
Are you okay?

28:14.151 --> 28:15.778
Oh, yeah.
I had it under control.

28:15.986 --> 28:16.828
You almost drowned in mud.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.622
No, I was, uh..

28:18.822 --> 28:20.039
Thinking up a spell in my head.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.163
Go check on the driver.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.290
[coughifl9l

28:38.050 --> 28:39.427
Don't torture yourself
over it, luv.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.012
There was nothing we could
do for the blighter

28:41.220 --> 28:42.472
and the last thing we want
to do is stick around

28:42.679 --> 28:43.976
and get drawn into a police
investigation.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.354
I don't understand.
What was in the car?

28:46.558 --> 28:49.061
That's the price of doing
business with yours truly.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.191
I tried to warn you.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.818
I know. I'm still here.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.572
Piss off.
There's nothing to look at.

28:55.776 --> 28:56.868
What's going on?

28:57.069 --> 28:58.867
Back home, our miners

28:59.071 --> 29:00.698
called 'em "Coblynau"

29:00.906 --> 29:02.533
but you see 'em
in every culture.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.368
They're the spirits
of dead miners.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.955
They knock on walls
to warn of danger.

29:08.163 --> 29:11.667
So, these Coblynau..
They're protecting the miners?

29:11.875 --> 29:13.092
They warn them of danger
instead of causing it?

29:13.293 --> 29:15.421
That's right.

29:15.629 --> 29:18.348
Traditional Coblynau,
they never rise to the surface

29:18.548 --> 29:20.642
and they certainly don't murder.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.560
So, what's the explanation?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.513
Could be the Rising Darkness.

29:24.721 --> 29:28.066
Something's forcing evil
to the surface in waves.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.110
It's changing the rules.

29:30.310 --> 29:33.359
I'm sensing a little
of the human touch.

29:33.563 --> 29:37.158
Like someone's... calling
these spirits on purpose.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.954
Nothing says payback better
than death by demon.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.156
If I'm right

29:43.365 --> 29:46.164
then someone's conjuring
these bad boys from close by.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.245
Like a miner.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.921
I heard that they're all
gathering at the pub

29:50.122 --> 29:51.795
for an emergency meeting.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.878
Think we need to change, luv.
I'll meet you there.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.969
(Thad) 'Alright, look, if you're
just gonna fly off the handle'

30:00.132 --> 30:02.351
and turn this into
some kind of a spook show

30:02.551 --> 30:04.679
then I have nothing to say
to you right now.

30:04.886 --> 30:05.728
'Crazy rumors
aren't gonna help anyone..'

30:05.929 --> 30:07.055
Curious.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.608
Skeptical drunks
nowhere to be seen.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.401
You mean the ex-priest?

30:11.601 --> 30:12.773
- Come again?
- Ellis.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.696
He used to be a priest

30:14.896 --> 30:17.945
before his, uh,
son died in the mines.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.825
Which could be a good cause
for payback.

30:22.029 --> 30:23.827
When I gave you the slip
yesterday

30:24.031 --> 30:26.250
I found evidence of one of those
slurry things being raised

30:26.450 --> 30:28.373
in an abandoned church
outside of town.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.205
The church that Ellis turned
his back on.

30:31.413 --> 30:35.714
So, he could be the one that's
conjuring the evil for revenge?

30:35.917 --> 30:39.296
Come with me.
I'm taking you for a spin.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.177
Excuse me, mate, um,
but, look, my lady

30:41.381 --> 30:42.633
she's having
a bit of a turn, you know?

30:42.841 --> 30:44.218
Do you mind if we commandeer
your seat right here?

30:44.426 --> 30:48.772
Is that alright?
Oh, thanks a lot, mate. Thanks.

30:48.972 --> 30:52.897
- Take a seat.
- I get it, okay?

30:53.101 --> 30:54.728
This is his stool,
his spot, where he drinks

30:54.936 --> 30:55.903
but I can't control my visions.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.697
Well, you did yesterday.

30:57.898 --> 31:01.619
Just remember what I told you.
Now close your eyes.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.822
[sighs]

31:05.030 --> 31:06.998
Lock out the world.

31:10.619 --> 31:11.666
It's cold.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.498
- What's that, luv?
- My feet.

31:14.706 --> 31:19.132
Slowly, without losing
the vision, open your eyes.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.680
Look at your feet.'

31:27.928 --> 31:29.976
[laughs]

31:30.180 --> 31:32.274
There's a river.

31:32.474 --> 31:34.351
There's a waterfall.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.277
Stay in the vision.

31:36.478 --> 31:37.604
'Look for clues.'

31:37.813 --> 31:39.861
There's a... tent

31:40.065 --> 31:41.362
and an old chair in front of it.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.284
Like a sofa chair.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.533
Looks like a campground.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.284
You two decide yet?

31:47.489 --> 31:49.412
Charlie, is there a..

31:49.616 --> 31:52.711
A campground on a river
hereabouts?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.413
Rooster Creek's the closest.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.589
Rooster Creek.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.087
How can such a weak man
be capable

31:58.291 --> 31:59.292
of so much destruction?

31:59.501 --> 32:00.343
Well, people aren't all good

32:00.544 --> 32:02.171
and they aren't all wicked.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.802
Here, bristles up
to ward off evil.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.134
- What are you gonna use?
- My wits.

32:11.805 --> 32:14.183
Are you the Pastor Ellis McGee
of the Good Shepherd Church

32:14.391 --> 32:15.734
of St. Asaph?

32:15.934 --> 32:18.403
Not anymore.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.947
[speaking in foreign language]

32:26.403 --> 32:28.622
[both speaking
in foreign language]

32:34.995 --> 32:37.043
- You know it.
- Of course I know it.

32:37.247 --> 32:39.591
The Breastplate of St. Patrick.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.259
What the hell's going on here?

32:41.460 --> 32:43.804
I'm here to end
your spiritual warfare.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.597
'Your skills
to channel the divine'

32:45.797 --> 32:47.674
'can also be used
to unleash evil.'

32:47.883 --> 32:49.430
You think I'm behind
the killings in this town?

32:49.634 --> 32:52.513
Your desecrated church
has all the power of evil

32:52.721 --> 32:53.847
you need, mate.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.853
You need faith to raise evil.

32:56.057 --> 32:56.899
In case you haven't noticed here

32:57.100 --> 33:00.229
I'm all tapped out.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.439
You know, John,
maybe we should listen to him.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.365
Fools. You got to get your
head out of the hogwash.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.193
You can't even see the facts
right in front of you.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.698
Like what?

33:07.903 --> 33:09.450
(Ellis)
'The men killed aboveground'

33:09.654 --> 33:12.077
they're not miners...
they're the bosses in charge.

33:12.282 --> 33:14.250
'Somebody's
finally making them pay.'

33:20.540 --> 33:21.837
You might be right.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.502
How many of the bosses are left?

33:23.668 --> 33:27.047
Just one. Owner
of the company, Thad Bowman.

33:27.255 --> 33:28.677
You have art supplies
in your car, right?

33:28.882 --> 33:30.759
Yeah.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.265
Spray paint's what we need.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.188
Come on.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.354
Coming, WW?

33:42.562 --> 33:45.566
Yeah, I'm right here, Dad.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.242
Peterson said
he cleared the east shaft

33:47.442 --> 33:48.989
but I also know that
little yellow-belly

33:49.194 --> 33:51.117
was scared to go down there.

33:51.321 --> 33:52.664
I want to see it for myself
before the men

33:52.864 --> 33:54.241
start showing up again
at first light.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.326
Listen, you really think
that this is a good idea

33:56.535 --> 33:58.287
opening the mine after
what happened yesterday?

33:58.495 --> 34:00.168
Men want to work, boy.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.874
You got to respect that.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.311
It looks clear to me.

34:18.514 --> 34:20.438
Let's check the down shaft.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.395
[thud]

34:28.900 --> 34:30.572
You really think
we should be doing this?

34:30.777 --> 34:33.701
Don't you start, boy.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.248
[rumbling]

34:37.993 --> 34:39.710
(Thad) Nathan!

34:39.911 --> 34:40.833
[screeching]

34:47.210 --> 34:48.882
[low growling]

34:49.087 --> 34:51.054
It is real.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.179
Paint.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.679
[clangirlg]

35:01.433 --> 35:03.731
Protector of Earth.

35:03.935 --> 35:07.815
'Guardian of the Soils
of Foundation'

35:08.023 --> 35:11.368
be welcome in this sacred space.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.912
By the Earth that is your body

35:14.112 --> 35:18.037
and the wisdom of the ancients.

35:18.241 --> 35:21.040
Hail and farewell.

35:31.588 --> 35:32.555
What did we do?

35:32.756 --> 35:35.384
I reminded it of what it is.

35:35.592 --> 35:37.640
A protective spirit.

35:37.844 --> 35:41.815
As I said, Coblynau
are peaceful buggers at heart.

35:45.185 --> 35:48.155
He's still breathing. He's okay.

35:48.355 --> 35:49.948
This one's not so lucky.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.492
[speaking in foreign language]

35:54.986 --> 35:56.954
So we're back
where we started from.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.657
[grunts]

35:58.823 --> 36:01.201
These handprints..

36:01.409 --> 36:02.706
I've seen this before.

36:02.911 --> 36:05.664
Where?

36:05.872 --> 36:09.001
We need to make sure that
no one comes down here again.

36:09.209 --> 36:10.586
Even Take him home.

36:10.794 --> 36:11.966
What are you gonna do?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.548
There's only one thing
I can think of.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.106
What's the priest doing here?

36:27.310 --> 36:29.563
He needs to be here to see this.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.573
You did good earlier.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.026
If I failed to mention it.

36:34.234 --> 36:35.736
Well, now I know
what line of work you do.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.787
It's not for everyone, luv.

36:39.322 --> 36:43.202
So, after this, you find
a nice, quiet new town?

36:44.744 --> 36:46.246
Yeah.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.877
Because I'm that kind of, uh..

36:49.082 --> 36:51.631
Chica Bonita.

36:51.835 --> 36:55.885
We really don't want
to be standing here.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.636
Sometimes appeals of faith
just need

36:57.841 --> 37:00.685
a little time to be answered.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.478
Care to do the honors?

37:10.603 --> 37:11.980
(Ellis) For my son.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.189
[been]

37:21.948 --> 37:24.201
I need your car keys.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.161
They're in the truck.
Where are you going?

37:26.369 --> 37:27.712
To do the hard part, of course.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.585
- We just blew up the mine.
- Oh, that we did.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.133
And the Coblynau will stay
at rest if they're left alone.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.926
But someone
with a very powerful magic

37:34.127 --> 37:36.596
summoned them to the surface
in the first place.

37:37.756 --> 37:38.973
This isn't over.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.222
The reporter, right?

37:46.431 --> 37:47.648
Philly Enquirer?

37:47.849 --> 37:49.192
[chuckles softly]

37:49.392 --> 37:50.689
Can I come in?

37:50.894 --> 37:53.647
I'm afraid I have guests.

37:53.855 --> 37:56.404
I know who killed your husband.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.781
In that case..

37:58.943 --> 38:01.366
L think you should meet
my guests.

38:01.571 --> 38:04.745
Well, aren't you going to
invite me in, then?

38:04.949 --> 38:05.791
No need.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.336
[growling]

38:10.163 --> 38:12.712
Now... you had news for me?

38:14.375 --> 38:16.753
I'll give you one chance.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.259
Send your pets away
and I'll spare you.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.932
How did you know?

38:21.132 --> 38:24.511
The coal mark on your arm
when I first met you.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.437
I saw one just like it
on a young lad

38:26.638 --> 38:27.981
the Coblynau
were trying to kill.

38:28.181 --> 38:31.936
And then... l remembered
what you said.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.734
You're Romani.

38:35.939 --> 38:38.408
There's nothing blacker
than gypsy magic.

38:38.608 --> 38:41.202
When I left home,
I promised myself

38:41.402 --> 38:43.404
I'd never use
my family's magic again.

38:43.613 --> 38:44.535
[Coblynau growling]

38:44.739 --> 38:46.366
'And then
it all came back to me'

38:46.574 --> 38:50.329
'more powerfully
than ever before.'

38:50.537 --> 38:52.084
The only reason
you could do what you did

38:52.288 --> 38:55.337
is because there's
a darkness spreading everywhere

38:55.542 --> 38:58.466
even to lonesome little
backwaters like Heddwich.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.968
It's infecting you.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.300
No. You're wrong.

39:03.508 --> 39:06.853
Send these poor sods back
to where they belong.

39:07.053 --> 39:09.806
[growls]

39:11.558 --> 39:13.936
Kill him.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.530
[John grunts]

39:17.730 --> 39:20.483
You forgot one thing
you stupid bat!

39:20.692 --> 39:22.194
These are the spirits
of dead miners

39:22.360 --> 39:24.829
and your husband,
that you murdered, was a miner!

39:25.029 --> 39:27.452
Oh, restless spirit
of this house

39:27.657 --> 39:30.627
I summon thee
to seek thy revenge!

39:38.960 --> 39:40.303
[low gasp]

39:40.503 --> 39:43.473
Lannis? No!

39:43.673 --> 39:45.767
Let go of me! No!

39:45.967 --> 39:47.765
I'm the victim!

39:47.969 --> 39:50.438
[screaming]

39:54.017 --> 39:55.940
[Pants]

39:56.144 --> 39:58.488

[door closes]

40:12.243 --> 40:13.745
[sighs]

40:13.953 --> 40:15.330
Moving in, are we?

40:15.538 --> 40:17.006
You wish.

40:18.875 --> 40:22.505
Well, I'm afraid I'm in no mood
for sparring tonight, darling.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.885
Of course not. You almost died.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.808
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.811
[scoffs] No, you didn't.

40:34.015 --> 40:37.235
You just wanted to make sure
I didn't run out on you again.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.154
- Was that the plan?
- Listen, Zed.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.653
There's no denying
that you provide

40:42.857 --> 40:44.700
moderate value in the field.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.404
- I saved your life.
- Well, that's open to debate.

40:47.612 --> 40:50.161
The truth is, I work best alone.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.208
- Me, too.
- I always put myself first.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.410
That's the only way
I've survived.

40:54.619 --> 40:58.340
Everyone who puts their trust
in me dies.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.842
Okay, you got me.

41:08.383 --> 41:11.557
[sighs] You see, John..

41:11.761 --> 41:14.310
L've been waiting for you..

41:14.514 --> 41:16.141
And you found me.

41:16.349 --> 41:17.475
I don't know
what I've been waiting for

41:17.684 --> 41:20.654
and you don't know
what you've found.

41:20.812 --> 41:24.157
The question is, are we gonna
help each other out or not?

41:24.357 --> 41:25.904
[sighs]

41:29.612 --> 41:31.740
[groans]

41:34.242 --> 41:36.665
If you'll excuse me

41:36.869 --> 41:38.917
I'm bloody knackered.

41:46.045 --> 41:48.423
[instrumental music]

41:53.011 --> 41:55.139
(John) Isuppose it
could be liberating

41:55.346 --> 41:57.474
to take a leap of faith

41:57.682 --> 41:59.355
to shrug off the burden of proof

41:59.559 --> 42:01.482
for the promise of hope.

42:01.686 --> 42:04.610
It takes trust
to turn darkness to light.

42:04.814 --> 42:06.282
And those who trust

42:06.482 --> 42:09.486
risk putting their faith
in the wrong hands.

42:09.694 --> 42:12.197
For there are those
who pray for you

42:12.405 --> 42:15.409
and there are those
who prey on you.

42:17.618 --> 42:20.462
And no matter
how careful you are

42:20.663 --> 42:25.294
sometimes you just can't
tell the difference.
