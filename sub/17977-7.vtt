12:27.634 --> 12:29.132
OF HERSELF,

12:29.167 --> 12:31.132
AND I...

12:31.167 --> 12:32.801
YOU KNOW.

12:32.834 --> 12:36.334
WELL, WE ALL HAVE
DIFFERENT RITUALS

12:36.366 --> 12:38.200
TO EXORCISE HEARTBREAK.

12:38.234 --> 12:40.299
YOU HAVEN'T
COMPLETED YOURS, ALICE.

12:40.334 --> 12:43.133
NO, I DID, I DID.

12:43.167 --> 12:44.267
YOU KNOW, I THREW IT AWAY

12:44.299 --> 12:46.067
LAST WEEK

12:46.067 --> 12:48.734
SINCE YOU RELEASED ME
FROM MY MORTAL COILS.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.100
YOU THREW IT AWAY?

12:50.133 --> 12:51.466
YEAH, I DID,
AND IT WAS A REALLY--

12:51.500 --> 12:52.533
IT WAS A BIG DEAL FOR ME.

12:52.567 --> 12:55.366
GET HER BACK, ALICE.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.868
I THREW IT AWAY. IT'S GONE.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.466
THE GARBAGE MEN,
THEY TOOK IT AWAY THIS MORNING.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.000
IT'S GONE.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.266
YOU ENDOWED MOJO
INTO THIS LIFE-SIZE VOODOO DOLL.

13:03.299 --> 13:06.200
YOU DON'T JUST THROW IT AWAY.

13:06.234 --> 13:07.934
YOU HAVE TO PROPERLY RELEASE IT

13:07.968 --> 13:09.868
AND LET HER GO.

13:09.900 --> 13:10.968
I DO?

13:16.800 --> 13:17.900
CALL ME

13:17.934 --> 13:20.900
WHEN YOU'VE TAKEN CARE
OF DANA.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.299
YOU MIGHT FEEL
A LITTLE NAUSEOUS

13:43.334 --> 13:44.399
LATER ON TONIGHT

13:44.433 --> 13:45.901
AND FOR THE NEXT
FEW DAYS, DANA.

13:45.933 --> 13:49.366
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
A PRESCRIPTION FOR ZOFRAN.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.200
TAKE ONE IN ABOUT
EIGHT HOURS

13:51.234 --> 13:52.299
IF YOU NEED IT,

13:52.334 --> 13:54.901
AND ONE TABLET
TWICE A DAY

13:54.933 --> 13:56.901
FOR THE NEXT
TWO DAYS.

13:56.933 --> 13:57.968
ARE THERE ANY
SPECIAL FOODS

13:58.067 --> 13:58.968
THAT I SHOULD BE--

13:59.067 --> 14:00.000
AM I GOING TO DIE?

14:02.968 --> 14:05.067
YOU ARE YOUNG,

14:05.067 --> 14:07.299
AND YOU HAVE TAKEN
EXCELLENT CARE OF YOURSELF.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.400
YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE
OF SURVIVING

14:09.433 --> 14:11.099
AND LIVING A FULL
AND PRODUCTIVE LIFE,

14:11.132 --> 14:12.634
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER

14:12.666 --> 14:15.933
TO IMPROVE
THOSE CHANCES.

14:15.968 --> 14:17.167
NOW, SINCE CHEMO
HAS THE EFFECT

14:17.199 --> 14:19.067
OF BREAKING DOWN
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM,

14:19.100 --> 14:22.167
YOU HAVE TO BE MINDFUL
ABOUT INFECTION.

14:22.199 --> 14:23.701
SO WASH YOUR HANDS OFTEN,

14:23.734 --> 14:25.199
KEEP YOUR HOT FOOD HOT,

14:25.234 --> 14:26.501
COLD FOOD COLD,

14:26.533 --> 14:27.833
AND AVOID
ANY SITUATION

14:27.867 --> 14:29.567
WHERE YOU CAN CUT YOURSELF,

14:29.600 --> 14:31.434
AND UNLESS YOU'VE HAD
ALL THE CHILDHOOD DISEASES,

14:31.466 --> 14:34.399
CHICKEN POX,
GERMAN MEASLES, MUMPS,

14:34.433 --> 14:35.667
TRY TO AVOID
ANY CHILDREN

14:35.701 --> 14:38.234
WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN
EXPOSED TO THEM.

14:38.267 --> 14:40.933
IT'S ALL PRETTY
COMMON-SENSE STUFF.

14:40.968 --> 14:42.200
ANY QUESTIONS?

14:42.234 --> 14:45.167
WHEN AM I GOING
TO LOSE MY HAIR?

14:52.433 --> 14:53.968
ANYTHING YOU NEED,
WE'VE GOT IT.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.067
OKAY, WELL,

14:55.067 --> 14:56.600
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
PUT EVERYTHING,

14:56.634 --> 14:57.868
YOU KNOW,
NEAR THE STAGE.

14:57.901 --> 14:59.466
THEY'LL GET IT
ALL TOGETHER

14:59.500 --> 15:01.300
FOR SOUND-CHECK
TOMORROW, OKAY?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.067
DID YOU WANT A PICK-UP
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT?

15:03.100 --> 15:04.666
YEAH. YEAH,
LATE TOMORROW NIGHT,

15:04.700 --> 15:07.067
AFTER THE SHOW,
ABOUT 2:00 A.M.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.701
IT SPEAKS.

15:08.734 --> 15:13.067
THAT'S MR. "IT" TO YOU,
SUPERFLYSTRESS.

15:13.099 --> 15:14.132
LOOK AT YOU.

15:14.166 --> 15:15.333
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SLEPT?

15:15.367 --> 15:17.067
DON'T GIVE ME
ANY SHIT, KIT.

15:17.067 --> 15:18.434
I HAD TO JACK OFF
TWICE TODAY

15:18.466 --> 15:20.067
JUST TO GET
MY HEART STARTED,

15:20.067 --> 15:21.667
AND ANYWAY,
I DON'T SLEEP.

15:21.701 --> 15:23.466
I'VE FMS.

15:23.501 --> 15:25.067
FMS?

15:25.067 --> 15:27.067
WHAT IS FMS?

15:27.067 --> 15:29.934
IS THAT FAG MUNCHAUSEN
SYNDROME OR SOMETHING?

15:29.968 --> 15:31.132
NO, FEAR OF
MISSING SOMETHING.

15:31.167 --> 15:32.234
GIVE ME A HAND UP.

15:32.267 --> 15:33.299
OH, JESUS.

15:33.334 --> 15:34.466
WELL, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU GOT.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.133
ALL I WANT YOU TO DO
IS GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER

15:36.167 --> 15:37.399
BY TOMORROW NIGHT,

15:37.433 --> 15:38.933
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
ANY FUCK-UPS WITH THE B-52's--

15:38.968 --> 15:40.299
DO NOT GIVE ME
ANY ATTITUDE ABOUT THIS.

15:40.334 --> 15:41.399
I'M THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT THEM HERE.

15:41.433 --> 15:42.399
I KNOW...

15:42.433 --> 15:43.399
I KNOW.

15:43.433 --> 15:44.466
I KNOW YOU BOOKED THEM.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.567
I KNOW
YOU'RE THE BEST OF FRIENDS,

15:45.600 --> 15:46.567
HOMEY HOMES,
WAY BACK IN THE DAY.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.801
I KNOW THIS.
I KNOW ALL OF THIS--

15:47.834 --> 15:49.067
WELL, THEN, YOU
SHOULD ALSO KNOW

15:49.100 --> 15:50.299
THAT ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS KEEPING THE BOOZE FLOWING

15:50.334 --> 15:51.834
AND KEEP YOUR OWN VICES
UNDER CONTROL.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.299
I MEAN,
I DON'T LET MINE GET IN THE WAY

15:53.334 --> 15:56.600
OF MAKING YOUR
BUSINESS FLOURISH.

15:56.634 --> 15:58.433
I DIDN'T HAVE TO BOTTOM OUT
TO GET MY LIFE TOGETHER.

16:05.234 --> 16:07.067
AND YOU'RE BOTH
GOING TO LOVE IT.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.199
IT'S WHERE WE MAKE FILMS.

16:08.234 --> 16:09.968
THE PLACE IS FULL OF SURPRISES.

16:10.067 --> 16:11.900
THERE'S LOTS OF LORRIES
ON THE LOT,

16:11.933 --> 16:13.333
AND THERE'S SHIPS,

16:13.367 --> 16:14.766
AND YOU'RE BOTH
GOING TO SEE EVERYTHING

16:14.801 --> 16:16.367
WHEN YOU NEXT
COME DOWN TO VISIT.

16:16.399 --> 16:18.067
[KNOCKING]

16:18.067 --> 16:19.800
MUMMY, CAN YOU TAKE ME
TO SEE THE COSTUMES?
COME IN!

16:19.833 --> 16:21.367
OF COURSE, PUMPKIN,

16:21.399 --> 16:24.300
I'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE WARDROBE DEPARTMENT.

16:24.333 --> 16:25.367
DID MAMA TELL YOU

16:25.399 --> 16:28.300
ABOUT DAMMA TETE'S
PARTY FOR US?

16:28.333 --> 16:31.466
YES, WINNIE TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT THAT.

16:31.501 --> 16:33.634
OH, MY GOD, ARE THOSE
YOUR CHILDREN?

16:33.667 --> 16:34.299
YEAH.

16:34.334 --> 16:35.634
SWEETHEARTS,

16:35.667 --> 16:38.100
CAN YOU BOTH JUST
SAY HI TO DYLAN?

16:38.133 --> 16:39.466
HI, DYLAN!

16:39.500 --> 16:40.533
HI, YOU TWO.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.133
I CAN'T WAIT
TO MEET YOU.

16:43.167 --> 16:44.901
SWEETHEARTS, MUMMY'S
GOING TO HAVE TO GO NOW.

16:44.933 --> 16:46.267
I'M SORRY.

16:46.299 --> 16:48.067
BUT I'LL SPEAK TO YOU
TOMORROW, OKAY?

16:48.067 --> 16:49.200
BIG BIG KISS
TO YOU.

16:49.234 --> 16:50.200
BYE, MUMMY!

16:50.234 --> 16:51.200
I LOVE YOU!

16:51.234 --> 16:52.200
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

16:52.234 --> 16:53.200
BYE!

16:53.234 --> 16:55.067
BYE.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.299
MY GOD, THAT IS SO GREAT

16:58.334 --> 17:00.000
THAT YOU CAN SEE THEM
WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM LIKE THAT.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.100
YEAH.

17:02.133 --> 17:03.567
I TALK TO THEM
EVERY DAY.

17:03.601 --> 17:05.333
UM, I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

17:05.367 --> 17:08.701
AND I THOUGHT
I WOULD BRING YOU SOMETHING.

17:08.734 --> 17:12.300
THANK YOU.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.534
I'M GLAD YOU CAME BY.

17:18.132 --> 17:20.199
CADBURY'S FLAKE...

17:22.266 --> 17:23.533
AND BRANSTON PICKLE.

17:23.567 --> 17:27.199
TWO OF MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITES.

17:27.234 --> 17:29.533
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

17:29.567 --> 17:31.100
THANK YOU.

17:39.334 --> 17:41.200
HOW GOES EDITING?

17:41.234 --> 17:44.868
YOU HAVEN'T
CALLED ME.

17:44.901 --> 17:46.767
YOU KNOW, DYLAN,
I MADE A PROMISE TO MYSELF

17:46.801 --> 17:49.567
TO STOP SLEEPING
WITH MARRIED PEOPLE.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.500
DANNY'S MY BOYFRIEND.

17:53.533 --> 17:56.433
WE'RE NOT MARRIED.
WE LIVE TOGETHER.

17:56.466 --> 17:57.767
YEAH, BUT IN LESBIANWORLD,

17:57.801 --> 17:59.267
THAT IS MARRIED.

18:03.533 --> 18:05.267
I'VE WANTED TO CALL YOU,

18:05.299 --> 18:09.933
BUT THIS IS A REALLY
DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR ME.

18:09.968 --> 18:12.634
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE WITH SOMEONE ELSE,

18:12.666 --> 18:13.933
AND YOU'RE STRAIGHT.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.968
AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

18:17.701 --> 18:19.333
I AM STRAIGHT.

18:19.367 --> 18:23.067
BUT, DYLAN,
THIS IS A NO-WIN ON MY PART.

18:23.067 --> 18:26.333
WHAT STARTS IN CHAOS
ENDS IN CHAOS.

18:32.399 --> 18:35.933
I LIKE YOU...

18:35.968 --> 18:37.299
A LOT.

18:37.334 --> 18:41.968
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, DYLAN?

18:55.299 --> 18:56.567
I DON'T WANT
TO BE THE LIE

18:56.600 --> 19:00.000
YOU TELL
TO SOMEONE.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.367
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU WANT?

19:03.399 --> 19:07.234
YOU KNOW
WHAT I WANT,

19:07.267 --> 19:09.067
BUT I DON'T
WANT IT HALFWAY,

19:09.067 --> 19:10.367
AND I DON'T WANT IT

19:10.400 --> 19:15.567
AT SOMEONE
ELSE'S EXPENSE.

19:15.601 --> 19:19.634
WE SHOULD JUST
BE FRIENDS.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.800
CAN WE TRY THAT?

19:28.734 --> 19:29.766
HEY, ALICE?

19:29.800 --> 19:30.766
ALICE, WAKE UP.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.466
COME ON.

19:31.501 --> 19:32.267
[SPLASHING]

19:32.299 --> 19:34.801
COME ON, WAKE UP.

19:34.834 --> 19:35.834
COME ON.

19:35.868 --> 19:37.334
ALICE...

19:37.366 --> 19:40.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:44.868 --> 19:46.567
I THINK
THEY'RE REALLY DISCREET.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.133
YOU DO?

19:48.167 --> 19:49.433
YEAH.

19:49.466 --> 19:50.734
I HAD MY FIRST
GIRLFRIEND'S NAME

19:50.767 --> 19:52.100
TATTOOED
ON MY ANKLE.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.334
I HAD IT REMOVED.

19:53.366 --> 19:56.399
OH, WHY DIDN'T YOU PUT
SOMETHING ELSE ON IT, HUH?

19:56.433 --> 19:57.600
BRONWYN?

19:57.634 --> 19:58.901
[LAUGHS]

19:58.933 --> 20:00.000
HELLO, EVERYBODY.
HEY, JENNY.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.901
HELLO.

20:01.933 --> 20:02.900
HI, MISS.

20:02.934 --> 20:03.900
OH, HOW ARE YOU?

20:03.934 --> 20:04.900
I'M VERY GOOD.

20:04.934 --> 20:06.466
HI.

20:06.501 --> 20:09.166
HOW ARE YOU?

20:09.199 --> 20:13.300
I PICKED THESE
FROM THE GARDEN...

20:13.333 --> 20:14.300
FOR YOU.

20:14.333 --> 20:15.433
THANK YOU.
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

20:15.467 --> 20:16.867
HEY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE OUT OF HERE.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.333
I'M TAKING THE REDEYE
TO NEW YORK TONIGHT.

20:19.367 --> 20:22.234
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:22.266 --> 20:24.100
I'M GOING
TO BE MEETING

20:24.132 --> 20:25.466
WITH MY BOOK EDITOR.

20:25.501 --> 20:26.533
WELL, THAT'S EXCITING.

20:26.567 --> 20:28.100
IS MOIRA GOING
WITH YOU?

20:28.132 --> 20:29.900
NO, SHE HAS TO WORK
AT THE PLANET TONIGHT

20:29.934 --> 20:31.033
WITH BILLIE.

20:31.067 --> 20:32.334
RIGHT. WE HAD TO CLOSE TONIGHT

20:32.366 --> 20:34.033
SO WE COULD, YOU KNOW,
RIG FOR TOMORROW.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.634
THAT'S RIGHT, THE B-52's
ARE GOING TO BE THERE.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.067
THAT IS HUGE.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.334
KIT, HOW DID
YOU GET THEM?

20:38.366 --> 20:41.600
MY SEX-AND-DRUG-CRAZED MANAGER,
HE LANDED THEM.

20:41.634 --> 20:42.868
HAPPY FIRST
CHEMO, BABY.

20:44.801 --> 20:45.933
HEY...

20:45.968 --> 20:47.200
OH, MY GOSH, WOW.

20:47.234 --> 20:48.667
LOOK.

20:48.701 --> 20:50.701
HEY...

20:50.734 --> 20:53.200
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

20:53.234 --> 20:54.466
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S
A BEAUTIFUL CAKE.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.667
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
A CHEMO CAKE BEFORE.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.500
WELL, YOUR GIRL
MADE IT FOR YOU.

21:02.533 --> 21:03.701
YEAH.

21:03.734 --> 21:05.367
IT'S RED VELVET, BABY,
YOUR FAVORITE.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.133
YOU KNOW, I'M A LITTLE
NAUSEOUS RIGHT NOW, ACTUALLY.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.601
I DON'T THINK
I CAN HAVE ANY, OKAY?

21:08.634 --> 21:10.433
IT'S RED VELVET, BABY--

21:10.467 --> 21:12.300
LOOK, I'M FUCKING SICK, LARA.
OKAY? JUST TAKE IT AWAY.

21:13.666 --> 21:14.933
MAYBE LATER.

21:14.968 --> 21:16.067
I WANT SOME.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.167
I WOULD
LOVE A PIECE.

21:17.199 --> 21:19.466
IS THAT WEDDING CAKE?

21:19.501 --> 21:20.833
NO, IT'S NOT
WEDDING CAKE.

21:20.867 --> 21:22.199
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS

21:22.234 --> 21:23.600
BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND AND I
ARE TWO GOLD STARS

21:23.634 --> 21:25.266
THAT HAVE FOUND EACH OTHER.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.466
WHAT'S A GOLD STAR?

21:26.501 --> 21:27.667
OH, IT'S SOMEBODY
WHO'S GAY

21:27.701 --> 21:28.701
WHO'S NEVER HAD SEX

21:28.734 --> 21:30.132
WITH A PERSON
OF THE OPPOSITE SEX.

21:30.167 --> 21:31.800
YEAH, PEOPLE WHO BUMP
UGLIES WITH UGLIES.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.067
CAN I BE A GOLD STAR

21:33.100 --> 21:34.968
