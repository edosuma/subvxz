00:29.279 --> 00:30.948
After the death of his father,

00:31.031 --> 00:32.616
Marcus Aurelius...

00:33.784 --> 00:36.245
Commodus has
ended the war in Germania

00:38.622 --> 00:41.959
and has returned home to take
his father's place

00:42.042 --> 00:44.670
as Emperor of the Roman Empire.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.191
People of Rome...

01:06.275 --> 01:08.193
All hail your Emperor!

01:08.986 --> 01:14.533
Marcus Aurelius
Commodus Antonius Augustus!

02:12.966 --> 02:15.469
But while the people
celebrate the new ruler,

02:16.887 --> 02:20.182
not all are content
to see Commodus rise to power.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.455
White? Or red?

04:09.500 --> 04:10.542
You decide.

04:13.879 --> 04:16.339
As the daughter of Marcus Aurelius,

04:16.423 --> 04:19.510
Lucilla has been prepared for
a life of influence.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.347
But as her brother takes the throne,

04:24.264 --> 04:26.809
she begins to manipulate
members of the senate...

04:28.018 --> 04:30.687
looking for ways
to regain her power.

04:32.231 --> 04:33.899
Such a strong man....

04:35.901 --> 04:38.946
I wonder if you will show
the same strength in the Senate...

04:40.280 --> 04:41.490
with my brother.

04:43.325 --> 04:47.871
The Senate isn't worried about Commodus
and neither should you be.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.832
That doesn't sound
like much of a plan.

04:50.749 --> 04:54.253
The Emperor's inexperience
is the only plan we need.

04:54.837 --> 05:00.092
He's a boy out of his depth.
A boy who will do anything we wish.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.971
Such confidence.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.056
But I wonder...

05:07.141 --> 05:09.643
Who will do as I wish?

05:19.611 --> 05:21.363
It's hard to figure out what's going on

05:21.447 --> 05:23.073
in the head of Lucilla.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.659
Oddly enough,

05:25.742 --> 05:31.623
she seems to have thought that,
as Commodus's elder sister,

05:32.791 --> 05:35.502
that she had a better claim
on the throne than Commodus.

05:36.962 --> 05:42.259
And so Lucilla put together
a very high-level conspiracy against him.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.129
As Lucilla
begins to plot against her brother,

06:20.297 --> 06:24.218
the responsibility of the throne
starts to weigh on the new emperor.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.389
Do not be so hard on yourself.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.770
No man can please all men.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.315
My father could.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.487
You are not your father.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.572
You're Commodus.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.332
And we have to imagine

06:55.415 --> 06:59.294
the pressures that that would have placed
upon a young Commodus.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.882
That he would have to
have earned this position.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.969
He had to become the best Roman.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.722
He had to prove himself
to be the best man for the job.

07:13.767 --> 07:19.690
He had to fulfill
this immense ideological burden

07:19.773 --> 07:22.025
that the emperor had to bear

07:22.109 --> 07:26.613
in order to operate, in order to make sure
everything functioned correctly.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.724
The crowning of an emperor
marks a new era for Rome,

07:55.058 --> 07:58.145
and Commodus believes that to
carry on his father's legacy

07:58.645 --> 08:00.355
and make a mark of his own...

08:04.193 --> 08:07.112
he'll need to
gain the support of the Empire...

08:08.614 --> 08:11.700
starting with the military.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.631
When an emperor arrived on the throne,

08:25.714 --> 08:29.176
he gave the entire army a gift.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.513
Sometimes very small,

08:32.596 --> 08:35.057
sometimes equal to
a significant percentage

08:35.140 --> 08:36.725
of an entire year's pay.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.816
It was announced that what he was doing
was thanking them for their loyalty.

08:44.650 --> 08:45.609
And, of course, at some level

08:45.692 --> 08:48.779
what he was doing was actually
purchasing that loyalty going forward.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.826
For centuries,

08:53.909 --> 08:57.996
emperors have given gifts
to their soldiers returning from war...

09:00.499 --> 09:03.460
in the form of money, slaves...

09:06.255 --> 09:10.717
and land from conquered regions
in an effort to keep their support.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.181
For Commodus,

09:16.265 --> 09:18.559
winning the favor of the military

09:18.642 --> 09:22.646
is the first step
in securing the support of the Empire.

09:23.522 --> 09:26.191
But before he can give
the military its payment,

09:27.609 --> 09:31.697
he knows he'll have to
convince the Senate to back his plan.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.172
For the first time in generations,

09:50.174 --> 09:51.592
we are at peace.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.512
So I think those who lay their lives
on the line for Rome

09:56.054 --> 09:58.223
deserve far more
than simply our gratitude.

09:58.932 --> 09:59.767
Thank you.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.524
Emperor...

10:07.608 --> 10:10.277
-I could not agree more.
-An excellent idea.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.114
It's the right thing to do,
and precisely the right time to do it.

10:14.198 --> 10:15.991
Your support means a lot to me.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.494
Emperor, please.

10:19.036 --> 10:22.831
The legions have spent eight years
of their lives in Germania.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.918
We, Rome,

10:26.001 --> 10:28.378
owe them an enormous debt.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.840
A gift of rich, fertile lands
upon which to settle

10:31.924 --> 10:33.467
seems like the least
the Empire can do.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.010
Exactly. Which is why I proposed--

10:35.094 --> 10:38.430
May I ask
which areas you are considering?

10:39.223 --> 10:41.767
Etruria? Campania? Sardinia?

10:42.351 --> 10:43.936
Perhaps Macedonia?

10:45.395 --> 10:47.314
An excellent question, Senator.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.317
And to be honest, I haven't had
the time to get into specifics.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.318
And why would you?

10:51.902 --> 10:53.862
You have far more
pressing concerns to attend to.

10:54.530 --> 10:56.448
If I may, Emperor,

10:56.532 --> 10:58.826
offer the Senate's
assistance in this matter?

10:59.827 --> 11:02.412
You have just made
your triumphant return home.

11:04.164 --> 11:08.210
The process of assessing and allocating

11:08.293 --> 11:13.757
the most desirable plots of land
in our vast empire...

11:14.591 --> 11:15.843
This takes time.

11:17.219 --> 11:20.305
Time better spent reacquainting
yourself with Rome and...

11:20.848 --> 11:23.517
introducing yourself
to your subjects.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.020
That's a very generous offer, Senator.

11:27.604 --> 11:31.567
Please. Your father was
a great friend to the Senate.

11:32.484 --> 11:37.739
If it is within our power to make
your transition to the throne smoother,

11:39.992 --> 11:41.827
it would be an honor.

11:48.459 --> 11:50.627
I gratefully accept your offer, Senator.

11:51.462 --> 11:53.297
This seems like something
that can only benefit

11:53.380 --> 11:54.631
from the Senate's expertise.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.968
Exactly. We deal with
this sort of thing every day.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.013
Why...

12:01.847 --> 12:04.850
bother yourself with
mundane administrative tasks?

12:04.933 --> 12:07.394
There will be much more of that
in the months and years to come.

12:07.853 --> 12:08.812
Fine then.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.898
Keep me informed of any developments.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.402
Absolutely.
You'll be the first to know.

12:20.741 --> 12:24.161
Your doubts were unfounded,
Senator Dio.

12:25.287 --> 12:29.541
-The Emperor is a boy.
-But he is still the Emperor.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.882
Against the advice of the Senate,

12:37.633 --> 12:40.636
Commodus ended the war
against the Germanic tribes,

12:42.096 --> 12:45.724
losing favor among some of
Rome's most influential citizens...

12:51.438 --> 12:54.983
including a senator
named Quintianus.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.280
With Lucilla's backing,

13:00.948 --> 13:04.785
the senator begins to lay
the groundwork for his first play...

13:07.579 --> 13:13.043
believing he can undermine the Emperor
if the Senate takes credit for the gifts.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.133
Senators,

13:19.216 --> 13:22.511
part of that aristocratic elite,
could actually be a threat

13:22.594 --> 13:25.097
in certain circumstances
to the Emperor.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.935
They had a bit more autonomy,
a bit more wealth,

13:30.727 --> 13:34.189
and the familial background
that some of them could compete

13:34.273 --> 13:38.944
in certain contexts with imperial power
if the situation was just right.

13:40.696 --> 13:44.074
So they were not always
trustworthy in that sense.

14:00.924 --> 14:01.842
Emperor...

14:08.932 --> 14:11.560
Saoterus and Cleander
are here to see you.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.028
- Emperor...
- What is it?

14:21.111 --> 14:22.029
This.

14:32.539 --> 14:36.126
"The Senate hereby announces
a gift to the brave legions..."

14:38.545 --> 14:39.546
The Senate?

14:41.423 --> 14:42.382
Where did this come from?

14:42.466 --> 14:44.259
It was posted in the forum.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.471
This was my gift.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.307
My name is nowhere on here.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.525
They offer their assistance,

15:00.484 --> 15:01.318
and then they do this?

15:03.946 --> 15:07.324
Now my soldiers think their Emperor
places no value on their service.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.579
That only the Senate honors them.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.791
I have to do something.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.293
I'll tell you what you do.

15:19.253 --> 15:21.672
Let the streets run red
with their blood.

15:22.631 --> 15:25.342
Just tell me which ones,
and I will see to it myself.

15:26.427 --> 15:27.678
If we kill them...

15:29.263 --> 15:30.347
Emperor.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.058
Punishing the Senate
by spilling their blood

15:33.142 --> 15:34.518
would send a strong message,

15:34.601 --> 15:37.646
but the streets would be in turmoil.

15:38.397 --> 15:41.191
So soon after you have brought
peace to the Empire.

15:41.275 --> 15:44.319
-It's the last thing the people want.
-Who cares what the people want?

15:44.403 --> 15:45.863
I do.

15:45.946 --> 15:46.822
Emperor, I did not mean to say--

15:46.905 --> 15:47.990
You're angry.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.242
We all are.

15:52.286 --> 15:53.620
Saoterus is right.

15:55.456 --> 15:56.999
We must settle this another way.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.252
-We must--
-We must stab them back,

16:00.753 --> 16:02.504
but not to draw blood.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.761
For what do Senators
love more than life itself?

16:11.346 --> 16:12.347
Money.

16:13.682 --> 16:16.059
Then that's where
you stick the knife.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.105
Good.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.400
Good. Come back in the morning.

16:27.613 --> 16:28.655
For Commodus,

16:29.239 --> 16:32.951
the Senate's betrayal is
a decisive move against his reign.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.580
And he knows to maintain his authority,

16:37.456 --> 16:39.958
he'll need to devise a counterattack.

16:41.502 --> 16:44.421
Essential for
understanding Roman social relations

16:44.505 --> 16:47.049
is the whole idea
of patron and client.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.635
So it was very,
very important, in the case

16:49.718 --> 16:52.137
of these donatives to Roman soldiers,

16:52.221 --> 16:53.972
where was the source
they were coming from?

16:54.056 --> 16:57.017
Was it coming from the Emperor
or was it coming from the Senate itself?

17:04.775 --> 17:06.944
Finally, Gentlemen...

17:07.944 --> 17:10.405
I would just like to thank you
for the assistance you gave

17:10.489 --> 17:12.491
in arranging my gift
to the soldiers.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.952
Should you need anything else?

17:15.661 --> 17:18.539
I've been told that the lands you chose
are some of the finest in the Empire.

17:19.123 --> 17:21.208
My soldiers are extremely grateful.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.876
That means everything to us.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.503
I've been thinking...

17:26.171 --> 17:28.507
They're not the only ones
who sacrificed.

17:29.258 --> 17:30.092
Emperor.

17:30.175 --> 17:34.596
Compared to the brave legions,
our sacrifices have been minimal.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.057
I was actually speaking
about the people.

17:40.269 --> 17:43.355
Well, what I meant was--

17:43.439 --> 17:45.441
Is that this goes without saying.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.026
The people made great sacrifices

17:48.110 --> 17:50.154
and offered steadfast support
throughout the war.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.738
Exactly.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.825
So I was thinking
one way I could thank them...

17:56.243 --> 17:57.703
is to stage a day of games.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.123
Games.

18:02.166 --> 18:03.000
Yes.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.918
On the first Saturday of next month.

18:05.878 --> 18:08.839
A massive day of gladiator games...

18:10.257 --> 18:12.760
ushering in a new era
of peace in the Empire.

18:13.886 --> 18:14.720
Emperor...

18:15.929 --> 18:19.141
Please do not mistake our reticence
to imply disagreement.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.893
The people deserve a day of games

18:20.976 --> 18:23.270
and much more, without question.

18:24.897 --> 18:26.148
But if I may speak freely...

18:26.940 --> 18:27.816
Of course.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.402
Imperial games at the Coliseum,

18:31.069 --> 18:33.530
even for a single day,
are a costly undertaking.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.575
And after eight years of war,

18:36.658 --> 18:38.660
the treasury has been
stretched to the limit.

18:38.744 --> 18:39.912
I understand.

18:39.995 --> 18:42.206
Money would surely have to be
raised through taxation.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.332
And, well...

18:44.041 --> 18:46.585
To tax the people for the very games
you are staging for them?

18:46.668 --> 18:48.796
-Well, it would be--
-Unacceptable.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.341
If I may speak freely.

18:53.342 --> 18:56.303
You're right, Dio.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.514
The people shouldn't be taxed.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.143
And they won't be.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.106
I will see to it that
these games are paid for.

19:09.399 --> 19:10.859
Now, if you will excuse me.

19:16.448 --> 19:19.493
Commodus has launched
a strike against the Senate,

19:20.494 --> 19:23.205
demanding an even larger
gift for his people...

19:24.081 --> 19:25.415
a day of games.

19:33.132 --> 19:36.718
First staged as part of
funeral rites for the elite class,

19:38.679 --> 19:43.350
gladiator games have become a popular
spectator sport of the Roman people.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.938
Featuring violent fights...

19:49.648 --> 19:51.692
and public executions...

19:53.861 --> 19:56.905
used by emperors to gain support.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.955
People would be put to death.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.667
Then you had wild beast shows.

20:09.334 --> 20:12.713
You had exotic animals
released into the arena,

20:12.796 --> 20:14.214
maybe set against one another.

20:18.719 --> 20:22.097
And then as the climax,
you had a gladiatorial combat,

20:23.432 --> 20:27.770
and there was the feeling that
gladiators were the headline act.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.818
By staging an elaborate day
of gladiator games,

20:35.903 --> 20:39.490
Commodus believes he has a way
to win over the Roman people...

20:43.285 --> 20:45.329
while undercutting the Senate.

20:51.752 --> 20:53.462
Well, that sounds fine.

20:54.296 --> 20:57.549
- If you need to discuss it further--
- Dio. Did you hear?

21:01.887 --> 21:02.888
No...

21:04.306 --> 21:06.892
-Judging from your state of agitation--
-He deceived us.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.061
-He?
-The Emperor.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.814
What exactly did the Emperor do?

21:11.897 --> 21:14.983
He is taxing us, Senator.

21:15.067 --> 21:17.444
For the full cost of the games.

21:20.572 --> 21:21.406
I see.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.452
What is so amusing about that?

21:25.536 --> 21:27.454
"I will see to it
that these games are paid for!"

21:27.538 --> 21:29.540
And it would seem
he is doing just that.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.458
Paid for, by us.

21:31.542 --> 21:32.751
And you are just
going to stand there?

21:34.086 --> 21:36.588
If his father were alive
to see this disrespect--

21:36.672 --> 21:39.049
I will give the Emperor his due.

21:41.468 --> 21:44.638
Going forward,
I think it would be wise that we all did.

22:01.697 --> 22:04.700
By forcing the Senate
to pay for his games,

22:05.409 --> 22:07.661
Commodus has secured his revenge.

22:11.331 --> 22:15.169
But Quintianus refuses to admit defeat.

22:31.018 --> 22:31.977
To the Senate.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.479
I'll drink to that.

22:37.858 --> 22:39.860
Well, this is just the first step.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.237
We need to show the Senate
that if they cross Commodus again--

22:42.321 --> 22:44.031
We already showed them that.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.491
And you think that's enough?

22:45.949 --> 22:46.784
I do.

22:47.826 --> 22:49.369
And you think they won't respond?

22:49.453 --> 22:51.288
Who cares if they respond?

22:51.371 --> 22:53.040
They're not who you
should be focusing on.

22:53.123 --> 22:55.584
Emperor, with all due respect, I--

22:55.667 --> 22:56.877
Let him finish.

22:58.212 --> 23:00.005
You came back to Rome for a reason,

23:00.089 --> 23:01.757
not to play games with the Senate.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.217
They'll never give you your due.

23:03.926 --> 23:04.885
But the people.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.554
What did they do
when you announced your games?

23:08.430 --> 23:09.848
They were chanting
my name in the streets.

23:10.599 --> 23:13.393
Giving their thanks
to their Emperor.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.312
I couldn't have said it better myself.

23:16.271 --> 23:18.065
And doesn't that show you exactly

23:18.148 --> 23:20.234
where your attention should be?

23:27.574 --> 23:28.408
Drink.

23:28.492 --> 23:29.827
Tonight we celebrate.

23:32.996 --> 23:35.749
Commodus has outwitted the Senate...

23:36.834 --> 23:39.294
and guaranteed
the funding of his games.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.423
But to win over the people,

23:43.048 --> 23:46.552
he's convinced he has to do
more than stage a spectacle.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.391
Soon after taking the throne,

23:53.058 --> 23:56.061
Commodus launches
a massive P.R. campaign

23:56.145 --> 23:59.231
commissioning dozens
of statues in his image,

23:59.314 --> 24:02.901
and minting thousands
of coins with his profile.

24:03.527 --> 24:06.363
Commodus made sure
that he maintained the support

24:06.447 --> 24:08.115
of the Roman people.

24:08.198 --> 24:11.702
Coins are a great way for Emperors
to advertise their reign.

24:12.661 --> 24:16.832
It's a way that they can show themselves
as they want to be seen.

24:22.504 --> 24:25.382
People of Rome, thank you!

24:26.091 --> 24:27.968
And may the Gods be with you!

24:36.727 --> 24:41.231
Commodus was very
interested in popular appeal,

24:41.315 --> 24:43.859
and so many of his programs,

24:43.942 --> 24:46.820
such as the donation
of monies to the people

24:46.904 --> 24:51.033
were aimed around
garnering popular support.

24:52.284 --> 24:54.578
These were moves
that Roman Emperors made

24:54.661 --> 24:59.500
to really bask in the glow
of popular acclaim.

25:13.430 --> 25:16.683
As the Emperor's popularity
continues to grow,

25:17.976 --> 25:22.898
Lucilla realizes the time has come
to put her plan in motion.

25:24.191 --> 25:27.069
And with her connections
in the Senate in place,

25:28.320 --> 25:31.740
she makes her next move
to dethrone her brother.

25:33.450 --> 25:39.331
Lucilla resented what is
essentially a form of honorific demotion.

25:41.375 --> 25:45.254
And this resentment
seemed to have worked with

25:45.337 --> 25:49.758
the other resentments among
the leading senators and aristocrats,

25:49.842 --> 25:54.638
who also felt that Commodus had started to
infringe upon their dignity and honor.

25:55.973 --> 25:58.600
So what Lucilla may actually represent

25:58.684 --> 26:02.563
is the sentiments
of the traditional aristocracy.

26:02.646 --> 26:05.941
And their willingness to
move against a sitting emperor.

26:10.487 --> 26:12.072
Lucilla, this is your brother.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.117
Yes, I'm well aware
of his relationship to me.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.869
He's the Emperor of Rome.

26:16.952 --> 26:18.579
Only for as long as he lives.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.415
It sounds as though
something happened tonight.

26:21.874 --> 26:25.878
Nothing happened tonight.
This is about a lifetime of disrespect.

26:25.961 --> 26:27.337
You're upset. Sit down.

26:27.421 --> 26:28.756
I do not need to sit down.

26:28.839 --> 26:30.966
-Have a drink of wine.
-I do not need wine.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.510
I need him dead.

26:34.261 --> 26:35.804
And I need a drink.

26:35.888 --> 26:37.681
You need a backbone.

26:37.765 --> 26:39.850
You know,
if the Emperor were to die tonight,

26:39.933 --> 26:41.977
I would not shed a tear.

26:43.270 --> 26:44.480
But to murder...

26:46.482 --> 26:49.067
-There are other ways--
-It is the only way.

26:49.651 --> 26:53.447
You have underestimated him already,
and he only grows stronger.

26:53.530 --> 26:56.033
Are you so blind
you cannot see that?

26:58.368 --> 27:03.540
You are letting your hatred blind you.

27:07.086 --> 27:10.923
Senator, my hatred gives me clarity.

27:12.549 --> 27:13.926
But tell me,

27:14.843 --> 27:17.137
what does your cowardice do for you?

27:24.812 --> 27:27.064
While the Senator is reluctant to act,

27:27.773 --> 27:30.359
Lucilla's anger continues to grow...

27:31.568 --> 27:34.071
knowing she'll have to
follow through with her plan...

27:34.905 --> 27:37.491
with or without Quintianus.

27:49.503 --> 27:51.422
After announcing his day of games,

27:53.006 --> 27:55.759
Commodus takes his campaign
for the people...

27:56.218 --> 27:57.594
a step further.

27:58.846 --> 28:00.806
Saoterus, my brother.

28:00.889 --> 28:01.890
You called for me?

28:13.777 --> 28:14.820
What is this?

28:15.863 --> 28:16.947
Open it.

28:38.010 --> 28:41.722
Commodus has given Saoterus
one of the highest honors in Rome...

28:43.098 --> 28:44.641
known as the signet ring.

28:47.019 --> 28:48.353
Commodus...

28:49.855 --> 28:51.356
You deserve this and more.

29:17.674 --> 29:22.137
The signet ring was used
to seal letters, orders, et cetera in wax.

29:23.013 --> 29:26.475
It was about as close
a guarantee as you could get,

29:26.558 --> 29:27.601
given the technology at the time,

29:27.684 --> 29:31.563
that an item in question
was emanating from the Emperor.

29:34.858 --> 29:36.235
Thank you, brother.

29:48.831 --> 29:51.250
In giving the ring
to his most trusted friend,

29:54.294 --> 29:57.798
Commodus has named Saoterus
his closest advisor.

29:59.883 --> 30:02.094
And as one of the few men
he can trust,

30:03.178 --> 30:07.015
Commodus believes Saoterus
will appeal to the common people.

30:09.143 --> 30:13.313
Commodus, once he takes power,
is keen to become his own man,

30:13.397 --> 30:17.025
is keen to break away from
this group that he sees as being

30:17.109 --> 30:18.694
loyal to his father,

30:18.777 --> 30:21.864
always comparing him
negatively with his father.

30:21.947 --> 30:24.575
And instead,
he looks to appoint his own men.

30:25.159 --> 30:27.786
People who are freed men,
former slaves,

30:27.870 --> 30:30.664
who are from
the lower ranks of society.

30:47.181 --> 30:48.432
Gentlemen...

30:49.099 --> 30:51.101
My apologies
for keeping you waiting.

30:51.185 --> 30:52.728
The Emperor had some business

30:52.811 --> 30:55.022
he wished to discuss
with me before I departed.

30:55.105 --> 30:56.482
The Emperor is not joining us?

30:56.565 --> 30:58.066
He has sent me in his stead.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.985
In his stead?

31:00.527 --> 31:02.488
He has named me Chief Aide.

31:03.113 --> 31:06.742
I am to act as his proxy
in all matters pertaining to this body.

31:08.035 --> 31:10.245
It's all here in writing.
With the Emperor's,

31:10.329 --> 31:12.372
and my, official seal.

31:15.042 --> 31:15.918
Well, this is...

31:16.418 --> 31:20.339
-This is--
-This is a momentous occasion, Saoterus.

31:21.131 --> 31:22.758
Give the Emperor our warmest regards

31:22.841 --> 31:25.677
and let him know that
we look forward to meeting with him,

31:25.761 --> 31:27.763
-should the need arise.
-Of course.

31:28.347 --> 31:30.015
And now with that bit of business
out of the way,

31:30.682 --> 31:32.976
let me share this document
with your scribe.

31:34.895 --> 31:37.564
This is a disgrace to Rome,

31:38.732 --> 31:43.487
yet you stand and smile
at the freedman who now rules over you.

31:43.570 --> 31:46.698
I merely welcomed the man
who is here at the Emperor's request.

31:46.782 --> 31:48.951
The whim of the Emperor.

31:49.785 --> 31:53.455
-A man not fit to rule.
-But, in fact, he does rule.

31:53.956 --> 31:55.374
For now.

31:56.291 --> 31:57.960
Until something is done.

31:58.043 --> 31:59.962
What, may I ask you,
could be done?

32:01.130 --> 32:01.964
Gentlemen...

32:03.257 --> 32:05.008
-Shall we begin?
-Absolutely.

32:07.761 --> 32:10.305
Gentlemen, the Senate is in session.

32:14.726 --> 32:17.271
Commodus had difficulty

32:17.354 --> 32:20.649
in his relationships
with the Roman Senate,

32:20.732 --> 32:24.862
partially because
he chose as his advisors

32:24.945 --> 32:29.908
people who had originally
been slaves in his court.

32:32.703 --> 32:35.038
The Senate was not included

32:35.122 --> 32:36.707
in his inner circle.

32:36.790 --> 32:40.711
And this was perhaps
the most dangerous choice

32:40.794 --> 32:42.713
that Commodus made
during his reign.

32:45.924 --> 32:47.009
For Quintianus,

32:50.471 --> 32:53.724
Commodus has dealt
the ultimate insult to the Senate.

32:56.685 --> 32:59.772
And he realizes the only way
to settle the conflict...

33:00.522 --> 33:02.733
is to put an end
to the Emperor's reign.

33:12.993 --> 33:15.704
Oh by the Gods,
I wish you'd been there...

33:15.788 --> 33:19.416
just to see the look
on Quintianus's face.

33:21.585 --> 33:26.548
The son of a freedman
walking into the Senate,

33:26.632 --> 33:28.801
commanding their attention.

33:30.844 --> 33:31.845
Oh, brother.

33:43.482 --> 33:46.235
Senator Quintianus,
this is an unexpected visit.

33:46.318 --> 33:48.445
-I had to see you.
-And uninvited.

33:48.529 --> 33:49.696
It couldn't wait.

33:50.489 --> 33:51.782
Apparently not.

33:53.242 --> 33:55.994
But I happen to have been asleep,
and having a very pleasant dream.

33:57.371 --> 33:59.373
Commodus must die.

34:00.999 --> 34:02.167
My goodness.

34:02.751 --> 34:04.545
What on Earth did
my little brother do to you?

34:04.628 --> 34:06.046
He has no honor.

34:07.256 --> 34:11.342
Only contempt for everything
the Rome you and I know stands for.

34:11.427 --> 34:14.179
To name a freedman
to rule over the Senate!

34:24.857 --> 34:26.483
As resentment
against her brother

34:26.567 --> 34:28.025
grows in the Senate,

34:29.027 --> 34:31.989
Lucilla sees an opportunity
to further her plan.

34:33.699 --> 34:36.909
But she's not the only one
in the palace with an agenda.

34:39.329 --> 34:41.165
Slaves were instruments.

34:41.248 --> 34:45.210
They were extensions
of whoever owned them.

34:45.293 --> 34:48.045
They were nonexistent individuals.

34:48.130 --> 34:50.841
So you would have Romans
with their elite slaves

34:50.924 --> 34:52.176
that knew all of their secrets,

34:52.259 --> 34:54.803
knew everything that was going on
on a day-to-day basis.

34:54.887 --> 34:58.265
And the clueless master that believes
he has everything tucked away

34:58.348 --> 34:59.767
and nobody knows what's going on,

34:59.850 --> 35:01.560
when, of course,
the slaves know everything.

35:05.481 --> 35:08.066
After watching Saoterus rise to power

35:08.859 --> 35:11.153
and win the trust of the Emperor,

35:13.781 --> 35:17.242
Cleander is determined
to take his place...

35:18.410 --> 35:23.916
and will do anything
to seize the position for himself.

35:47.940 --> 35:49.274
What did you hear?

35:49.983 --> 35:53.362
I overheard Senator Quintianus
and Lucilla talking.

35:54.238 --> 35:56.323
They plan to murder the Emperor.

35:56.657 --> 35:57.783
When was this?

35:57.866 --> 35:59.243
Nearly two hours ago.

35:59.952 --> 36:03.163
-Who else was there?
-I'm not sure. Just me, I think.

36:05.541 --> 36:07.376
Go back to Lucilla's quarters.

36:07.918 --> 36:10.003
-Yes.
-Go...

36:28.772 --> 36:29.606
Madame?

36:30.023 --> 36:31.483
Yes, what is it?

36:31.567 --> 36:34.403
Sorry to disturb you,
but we have a...

36:34.987 --> 36:35.988
Cleander.

36:36.572 --> 36:37.448
...here to see you.

36:39.158 --> 36:40.284
Thank you, Tatiana.

36:48.083 --> 36:49.293
Sorry to intrude.

36:50.377 --> 36:51.879
But I was just passing by
and realized...

36:53.505 --> 36:55.007
I've never been in here before.

36:57.634 --> 36:58.886
Prepare my bath...

37:01.764 --> 37:02.848
If I'd have known you were coming,

37:02.931 --> 37:05.684
I would have had the cook
prepare something more substantial...

37:07.853 --> 37:10.439
-No need. I won't be long.
-Is that a promise?

37:18.030 --> 37:19.573
Just long enough to tell you...

37:22.868 --> 37:24.119
I know everything...

37:25.662 --> 37:27.372
about your plans
for the Emperor.

37:31.668 --> 37:34.129
Clearly, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

37:38.467 --> 37:39.468
Clearly...

37:43.514 --> 37:44.890
Which is a shame,

37:44.973 --> 37:47.935
given that anyone
plotting to kill the Emperor...

37:49.812 --> 37:52.981
could certainly use
someone close to him on their side.

37:56.318 --> 37:57.402
Tatiana.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.655
Yes, Madame?

37:59.738 --> 38:01.115
Never mind my bath.

38:01.824 --> 38:03.283
Our guest is very hungry.

38:04.660 --> 38:06.161
Prepare him a nice meal.

38:07.246 --> 38:09.123
We have much to discuss.

38:17.256 --> 38:19.758
There are several moments in the Empire,

38:19.842 --> 38:21.260
Commodus is one example,

38:21.802 --> 38:25.222
in which there's a nexus
of lower-status people around the Emperor

38:25.305 --> 38:26.682
who are perceived as his friends

38:26.765 --> 38:28.684
and are thought of
as dangerous for this reason.

38:29.518 --> 38:32.438
And because power
emanates from a single point,

38:32.980 --> 38:36.066
anyone else who wants access
to that power has to be close.

38:45.033 --> 38:49.204
I know that each of you
have taken great risks to be here.

38:51.373 --> 38:52.833
This is your one chance.

38:54.293 --> 38:57.296
The future of Rome is at stake.

38:58.630 --> 39:02.801
Commodus is destroying
everything that we hold dear.

39:03.302 --> 39:04.261
Our tradition,

39:05.429 --> 39:06.722
our culture.

39:07.848 --> 39:09.933
He must be stopped.

39:20.402 --> 39:21.320
Good.

39:22.780 --> 39:25.991
It is all going to happen
at the Games.

39:26.617 --> 39:27.576
Cleander?

39:29.661 --> 39:31.497
The most important person to remove...

39:32.748 --> 39:34.166
is Saoterus.

39:37.336 --> 39:38.879
And I will take care of that.

39:45.928 --> 39:48.931
Roman Emperors were
the most powerful people on the planet.

39:49.973 --> 39:55.145
It perhaps is not surprising that many men
wanted to have a part of that power

39:55.229 --> 39:57.815
and looked to take control themselves.

39:57.898 --> 39:59.316
And so throughout the Empire,

39:59.399 --> 40:02.194
we find that assassination
attempts are quite common.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.449
As Lucilla
and members of the Senate

40:07.533 --> 40:08.826
plot their overthrow...

40:13.288 --> 40:17.543
Cleander knows this is his opportunity
to eliminate Saoterus.

40:19.294 --> 40:21.547
And with all eyes on
the Emperor's games,

40:22.506 --> 40:24.508
he's determined to take advantage.

40:34.768 --> 40:36.437
After months of planning,

40:37.438 --> 40:40.524
the eve of the Emperor's
games has arrived.

40:44.027 --> 40:48.282
But while Commodus prepares for one of
his most important days as Emperor,

40:55.622 --> 40:58.500
Lucilla has recruited
influential senators...

40:59.042 --> 41:01.587
and members of
Commodus's inner circle...

41:02.212 --> 41:04.757
with a plan to dethrone the Emperor.

41:09.303 --> 41:12.389
Lucilla plots to have
Commodus assassinated.

41:13.974 --> 41:16.769
It may have been that she was
simply after power.

41:16.852 --> 41:19.229
Perhaps she wanted to be Empress.

41:20.856 --> 41:23.233
Or perhaps it was already clear to her

41:23.317 --> 41:27.863
that her younger brother was just
not up to the job of being Emperor,

41:27.946 --> 41:29.740
and so needed to be got rid of

41:29.865 --> 41:33.202
before he threatened the safety
of the Empire as a whole.

41:48.967 --> 41:50.511
On the day of the games,

41:51.095 --> 41:53.931
50,000 people
crowd into the arena....

41:56.433 --> 42:00.521
to see battles and performances
by more than 100 gladiators...

42:02.648 --> 42:04.650
and thousands of wild animals.

42:12.991 --> 42:16.870
These were celebrations
that involved the entire city of Rome.

42:17.371 --> 42:19.706
They would be shown
throughout the day

42:19.790 --> 42:21.125
the glory of the Empire,

42:21.208 --> 42:23.710
the glory of the Emperor
who was paying for all of this.

42:24.378 --> 42:26.088
They would be, of course,
encouraged to be loyal

42:26.171 --> 42:28.006
and see how great their Emperor was,

42:28.090 --> 42:29.967
that he provided
all of these things.

42:33.929 --> 42:35.431
But not everyone in Rome...

42:37.224 --> 42:38.725
is in the Coliseum.

42:42.396 --> 42:44.064
Look at this, Saoterus.

42:44.148 --> 42:46.191
Empty streets means a full Coliseum.

42:48.694 --> 42:51.905
Perhaps, some preliminary games?

42:53.157 --> 42:54.783
The Emperor is expecting us.

42:55.576 --> 42:57.744
If anyone will understand,
it's Commodus.

42:57.828 --> 42:59.204
Cleander.

43:01.331 --> 43:03.542
The games won't start
for another half hour.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.794
And I know for a fact,
you won't need that long.

43:18.223 --> 43:20.184
Emperor Commodus!

43:37.117 --> 43:40.204
Let the games begin!

43:59.098 --> 44:00.557
I'm sure they're on their way.

44:01.266 --> 44:03.519
-What other business could there be?
-They'll be here.

44:06.396 --> 44:08.148
Come here, you.

44:09.108 --> 44:10.609
♪ I love my friends... ♪

44:10.692 --> 44:12.444
Ahh, a lady.

44:12.528 --> 44:14.905
How are you? Oh, look.

46:48.058 --> 46:49.101
This is for the Senate!
