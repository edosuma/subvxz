<i>the way.</i>

11:00.060 --> 11:04.295
<i> [Laughs] Yes.</i>
<i> It's a slumber party</i>
<i>massacre.</i>

11:04.297 --> 11:05.864
<i>Joslyn Fox.</i>

11:05.866 --> 11:07.999
<i>There's a fox in the henhouse.</i>

11:08.001 --> 11:11.302
<i>[Laughs]</i>
<i> Oh, you're giving me a little</i>
<i>Raquel Welch there.</i>

11:11.304 --> 11:14.606
<i> Feathers are flying</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>
<i>Pillows are coming in my face.</i>

11:14.608 --> 11:20.779
<i>This is pure chaos.</i>
<i> Oh, dear.</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

11:20.781 --> 11:24.015
<i> [Exhales]</i>
<i> "Jos-leen."</i>
<i> Girls.</i>

11:24.017 --> 11:29.387
<i> How was it?</i>
<i> That was a mean trick.</i>
<i> I'm noticing that joslyn's</i>

11:29.389 --> 11:36.361
<i>skirt continue to rise all day.</i>
<i>I'm gonna need her to put some</i>
<i>panties on or some boy shorts or</i>

11:36.363 --> 11:39.264
<i>something.</i>
<i> Is there a bottom half to</i>
<i>that dress, girl?</i>

11:39.266 --> 11:42.467
<i> Hello.</i>

11:42.469 --> 11:44.169
<i>[Laughter]</i>

11:44.171 --> 11:45.103
<i>[Shutter clicking]</i>

11:45.105 --> 11:46.104
<i> Mm-hmm, that's gorgeous.</i>

11:46.106 --> 11:47.439
<i>Beautiful.</i>

11:47.441 --> 11:48.573
<i> Oh, yeah.</i>

11:48.575 --> 11:52.077
<i>Courtney Act is caught in the</i>
<i>act.</i>
<i> Courtney knows how to do</i>

11:52.079 --> 11:56.314
<i>sexy, she's a natural.</i>
<i> Yes, eat your heart out,</i>
<i>Kylie minogue.</i>

11:56.316 --> 12:00.618
<i> But you know what, Ru?</i>
<i>I think we need a little</i>
<i>something extra.</i>

12:00.620 --> 12:04.189
<i> Poppers?</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>pillow fight!</i>

12:04.191 --> 12:08.860
<i> Yeah!</i>
<i> You go.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

12:08.862 --> 12:14.733
<i> Yeah!</i>
<i> Oh, work it.</i>
<i>Oh, yes, mama.</i>

12:14.735 --> 12:18.136
<i>That's what I'm talking--</i>
<i>oh, yeah.</i>
<i>[Laughter]</i>

12:18.138 --> 12:24.342
<i> [Clucks]</i>
<i> Courtney's so funny and sexy</i>
<i>and really nailing this</i>

<i>challenge.</i>
<i> Mother, may I sleep with</i>

12:28.548 --> 12:31.683
<i>Magnolia Crawford.</i>

12:31.685 --> 12:34.819
<i> Play to the camera.</i>
<i>You need to serve that face,</i>
<i>girl.</i>

12:34.821 --> 12:42.594
<i>We're losing it.</i>
<i> All right.</i>
<i>You're killing me, Mary.</i>

12:42.596 --> 12:45.497
<i>Who's thirsty for Milk?</i>

12:45.499 --> 12:48.166
<i>Lower, Milk.</i>
<i> [Yells]</i>
<i> Ooh.</i>

12:48.168 --> 12:50.835
<i> Stay focused.</i>
<i> Hot Milk.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

12:50.837 --> 12:54.105
<i> Flash that Lauren hutton</i>

<i> Careful, those feathers are</i>

12:56.376 --> 12:57.408
<i> In your cleavage.</i>

12:57.410 --> 13:00.111
<i> Yes.</i>
<i> Oh, there's that cookie I had</i>
<i>earlier.</i>

13:00.113 --> 13:04.048
<i> Oh, wow.</i>
<i> [Blubbers]</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>

13:04.050 --> 13:08.219
<i>Motorboating on Darienne Lake.</i>
<i> Whew!</i>
<i> Oh.</i>

13:08.221 --> 13:10.555
<i> Good morning.</i>
<i> How did it go?</i>
<i> Hiii!</i>

13:10.557 --> 13:13.925
<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i> Did you enjoy it?</i>
<i> That was fun.</i>

13:13.927 --> 13:15.393
<i>[Tape ripping]</i>

13:15.395 --> 13:16.327
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

13:16.329 --> 13:17.095
<i> Hey, joslyn.</i>

13:17.097 --> 13:18.530
<i> [Groans]</i>

13:18.532 --> 13:19.464
<i> I'm trying to recognize</i>

13:19.466 --> 13:20.632
<i>everybody out of drag.</i>

13:20.634 --> 13:22.133
<i> Everybody's de-dragging,</i>

13:22.135 --> 13:23.568
<i>and it's kind of fun to see the</i>

13:23.570 --> 13:25.670
<i>man behind the curtain.</i>

13:25.672 --> 13:29.674
<i> Ooh, that felt good.</i>
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i> I'm just so surprised to see</i>

13:29.676 --> 13:34.279
<i>that Bianca Del Rio is a real</i>
<i>human being underneath all of</i>
<i>that clown makeup.</i>

13:34.281 --> 13:38.416
<i> Oh.</i>
<i>Boy bodies.</i>
<i>As a boy, Courtney Act is the</i>

13:38.418 --> 13:43.121
<i>cutest.</i>
<i>She is tan with that</i>
<i>beach-blond hair.</i>

13:43.123 --> 13:48.760
<i> I normally don't do dairy.</i>
<i>But for Milk, I'll make an</i>
<i>exception.</i>

13:48.762 --> 13:54.098
<i> Hello, hello, hello.</i>
<i>[Overlapping greetings]</i>
<i>and who the hell are you?</i>

13:54.100 --> 13:59.537
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>Ladies, I've pulled an</i>
<i>all-nighter reviewing your</i>

13:59.539 --> 14:04.309
<i>slumber party photos.</i>
<i>Some of you were a wet dream</i>
<i>come true.</i>

14:04.311 --> 14:09.948
<i>And others were a real...</i>
<i>[Snores] snooze.</i>
<i>But the winner of your first</i>

14:09.950 --> 14:14.352
<i>mini-challenge is...</i>
<i>[Drum roll]</i>
<i>[Coughs]</i>

14:14.354 --> 14:20.658
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>Whoa, where'd that come from?</i>
<i>Trinity K. Bonet.</i>

14:20.660 --> 14:25.463
<i> Whoo!</i>
<i> I won my first photo shoot</i>
<i>challenge!</i>

14:25.465 --> 14:28.766
<i>I'm posting your photo on the</i>

14:28.768 --> 14:30.768
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> instagram

14:30.770 --> 14:32.537
account so everyone can like

14:32.539 --> 14:34.739
it.

14:34.741 --> 14:39.944
That's good.
Now, as a little surprise,
I have a party favor for each

14:39.946 --> 14:44.549
of you.
[Giggles]
Oh, scruff pit crew!

14:44.551 --> 14:48.586
Oh, my.
Look at those packages.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.355
For this week's main challenge,

14:50.357 --> 14:52.123
you need to create your best

14:52.125 --> 14:54.492
life-of-the-party, high-fashion

14:54.494 --> 14:55.526
couture,

14:55.528 --> 14:58.363
#partylikeadragqueen,

14:58.365 --> 15:01.099
using only the leftovers from

15:01.101 --> 15:03.001
one of these party packs.

15:03.003 --> 15:08.973
There's toga party, luau party,
princess party, quinceanera...
[Laughter]

15:08.975 --> 15:15.046
St. Patrick's day party,
republican party,
and my favorite, hoedown.

15:15.048 --> 15:20.218
[Laughter]
Trinity, you won the
mini-challenge, so you get to

15:20.220 --> 15:26.491
pick yours first and then
re-gift the others.
I want the princess party.

15:26.493 --> 15:31.496
Now, which box have you
chosen for Darienne Lake?
St. Patrick's.

15:31.498 --> 15:35.433
[Irish accent] St. Patrick's
day party.
What about Joslyn Fox?

15:35.435 --> 15:42.307
"Quince-a-yetta."
Quinceanera for Joslyn Fox.
Yay.

15:42.309 --> 15:46.978
Magnolia Crawford.
Hoedown.
[Laughs]

15:46.980 --> 15:50.181
All right.
What about Courtney Act?
Republican.

15:50.183 --> 15:54.953
That seems fair and balanced.
For Bianca Del Rio?
Luau.

15:54.955 --> 15:58.456
Hope I get lei'd.
[Laughter]
[Weak applause]

15:58.458 --> 16:05.630
So that means that Milk gets
the toga party.
Gentlemen, start your engines.

16:05.632 --> 16:12.537
And may the best woman win.
This is the first challenge,
and I want to fucking win.

16:12.539 --> 16:17.542
I got bills to pay.
I got dogs to put through
college.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.509
Coming up...

16:18.511 --> 16:19.277
What kind of silhouette are you

16:19.279 --> 16:20.011
planning?

16:20.013 --> 16:23.748
I'm thinking very kind of...

16:23.750 --> 16:26.351
Like, sort of...

16:26.353 --> 16:27.385
Maybe not quite...

16:27.387 --> 16:28.753
More--oh, God.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.288
I don't know.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.457
[Dramatic drumbeat]

16:32.459 --> 16:34.258
[Laughs]

16:34.260 --> 16:38.296
[Laughs]

16:38.298 --> 16:42.834
[Dance music]
look, Courtney.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.803
What?
My hairy nuts.
[Laughs] Oh.

16:45.805 --> 16:49.941
Today's challenge is to create a

16:49.943 --> 16:52.010
high-fashion outfit based on

16:52.012 --> 16:58.583
what we have in our party box.
Hmm, okay.
It's like Christmas.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.651
[Giggling]

17:00.653 --> 17:06.924
Ooh.
There's every color you could
ever think of.

17:06.926 --> 17:10.194
[Giggles]

17:10.196 --> 17:15.933
I have house numbers.
A house nu--it's your age.
51.

17:15.935 --> 17:19.270
15.
Stick them on your head.
See if anybody comes to visit.

17:19.272 --> 17:24.809
[Laughs]
Knock, knock.
Okay.

17:24.811 --> 17:28.379
Hay.
That's ugly.
Oh, my God.

17:28.381 --> 17:32.550
This is...
Awful.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.086
I got a bunch of shit.

17:35.088 --> 17:39.757
It has nothing to do with my
style.
[Chuckles] Jesus Christ.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.627
Good God, girl, get a grip.

17:42.629 --> 17:48.800
That's ugly.
Hello, hello, hello.
Hi.

17:48.802 --> 17:52.970
Hi, RuPaul.
How are my party monsters
doing?

17:52.972 --> 17:56.407
Darienne Lake.
Hi.
Luck of the Irish.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.310
Oh.
[Twitters]
[Laughs]

17:59.312 --> 18:03.781
Oh.
So now of course, the box is
a St. paddy's day party box.

18:03.783 --> 18:07.452
But the challenge isn't to do
leprechaun.
Right.

18:07.454 --> 18:12.723
But it's to interpret the box
to Darienne Lake's style.
Exactly.

18:12.725 --> 18:17.929
And what kind of silhouette
are you planning?
I'm thinking very kind of...

18:17.931 --> 18:23.334
Like, glamour executive.
Sort of...
Maybe not quite...

18:23.336 --> 18:29.307
More--oh, God.
I don't know.
You know.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.944
So it's in process.
Is that what you're saying?
Mm-hmm.

18:32.946 --> 18:37.148
Dead.
Well, luck of the Irish to
you.

18:37.150 --> 18:41.486
[Imitates defibrillator]
Trinity K. Bonet.
Hey, what it do, mama Ru?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.621
Now, what's the "k" stand
for?
Kardashian.

18:43.623 --> 18:47.692
Kardashian, really?
So, now, you've got the princess
party box.

18:47.694 --> 18:51.696
Yes.
What are you planning for it?
I wanted to play with two

18:51.698 --> 18:58.202
type of princesses, futuristic
princess Leia and princess Kate.
Kate middleton.

18:58.204 --> 19:01.572
Exactly.
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah.

19:01.574 --> 19:05.109
So you're somewhere between
<i>star wars</i> and Buckingham
palace.

19:05.111 --> 19:10.414
Mm-hmm.
So, um, great.
I'm gonna be looking out for

19:10.416 --> 19:14.152
you.
Courtney Act.
Hi, RuPaul.

19:14.154 --> 19:17.955
I caught you in the act.
You did catch me in the act.
Thank you for explaining my name

19:17.957 --> 19:23.461
to America, because I know that
in American accents, it doesn't
always work, except maybe in

19:23.463 --> 19:26.397
Boston.
Right.
"Caht-ney" act.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.967
Yes.
Is this Courtney Act's style?
Because you show a lot of body,

19:29.969 --> 19:33.104
don't you?
Yeah.
I'm sure that Michelle will say

19:33.106 --> 19:36.941
"Courtney, stop relying on that
body."
[Laughs]

19:36.943 --> 19:41.279
Just make sure you don't come
down the Runway looking like
the dog's dinner.

19:41.281 --> 19:45.550
See you later.
Thank you, Ru.
Bianca Del Rio.

19:45.552 --> 19:49.086
You can call me jiggly.
[Laughs]
I've got to ask you.

19:49.088 --> 19:53.891
That rapid-fire, quick wit, did
you always have that?
It's just instinctive.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.494
And I call it my little rolodex
of hate.
So when you're faced with a

19:56.496 --> 20:01.232
situation, you just roll
through, and you go, "what do I
have, what do I have?"

20:01.234 --> 20:04.902
Now, you have a background in
fashion.
I work for a Broadway costume

20:04.904 --> 20:07.605
company in New York City.
We build costumes.
So it comes in handy when you're

20:07.607 --> 20:10.708
a drag queen.
Absolutely.
So I'm assuming you're gonna

20:10.710 --> 20:13.878
kill this challenge.
I hope.
I can't wait to see what you

20:13.880 --> 20:15.980
walk down that Runway with.
Well, thank you.
I'm looking forward to it.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.982
All right.
See you then.
Okay.

20:17.984 --> 20:21.919
Thanks.
Magnolia Crawford.
Hi, Ru.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.256
How you doing?
I'm feeling really--
real honky-tonky, ready for a

20:25.258 --> 20:28.526
hoedown.
That's the party box you got
is the hoedown.

20:28.528 --> 20:34.232
That's the box I got.
What was in there?
Hideous fabric.

20:34.234 --> 20:38.903
Really?
I got a big old sheet of
denim.

20:38.905 --> 20:42.607
Oh, denim is good.
We like denim.
Yeah, I don't think it

20:42.609 --> 20:48.579
screams high fashion.
There's this brown, which looks
like shit.

20:48.581 --> 20:52.283
What is Magnolia Crawford's
style?
I think of myself as

20:52.285 --> 20:56.887
a glamorous trash queen.
Uh-huh.
Things that are so ugly,

20:56.889 --> 21:00.658
they're pretty.
Well, listen.
This challenge could be right up

21:00.660 --> 21:05.963
your alley.
Turn it out, Magnolia Crawford.
Thank you.

21:05.965 --> 21:11.769
[Laughing] Okay.
Joslyn Fox.
Hey, "ruzy q."

21:11.771 --> 21:15.139
[Giggles]
Now, which box did you get?
Quinceanera.

21:15.141 --> 21:19.677
So what do you have planned?
I've finally selected,
narrowed down my fabrics.

21:19.679 --> 21:24.949
[Giggles]
Yeah.
That's a lot of fabric.

21:24.951 --> 21:29.186
Well, I want to avoid it
being too loud and too busy.
[Whimsical music]

21:29.188 --> 21:31.989
all right.
All right.

21:31.991 --> 21:37.194
Thank you, "ruzy q."
Well, hello there, Milk.
Hi.

21:37.196 --> 21:41.932
Are you wearing acid-washed
hot pants?
I am.

21:41.934 --> 21:48.839
[Laughs]
What is Milk all about?
She is big and scary,

21:48.841 --> 21:54.445
freaky and creepy.
And that's what I love to do.
So your camp aesthetic, how

21:54.447 --> 22:00.651
is that gonna meet with high
fashion?
I'm going for sort of <i>xanadu,</i>

22:00.653 --> 22:05.589
<i>like, jumpsuit.</i>
<i> Oh, boy, okay.</i>
<i>Do you think you can make</i>

22:05.591 --> 22:09.293
<i>a jumpsuit high fashion?</i>
<i> I do.</i>
<i> Yeah?</i>

22:09.295 --> 22:11.595
<i> Yeah.</i>
<i> Well, listen, I just gotta</i>
<i>tell you, you're up against</i>

22:11.597 --> 22:15.800
<i>a lot of competition.</i>
<i>And you will be under a lot of</i>
<i>scrutiny.</i>

22:15.802 --> 22:20.871
<i> I really want my first</i>
<i>impression to be unique,</i>
<i>something very Milk.</i>

22:20.873 --> 22:29.613
<i>I'm still doing pants.</i>
<i> Ladies, gather round.</i>
<i>Now, tomorrow the party moves to</i>

22:29.615 --> 22:36.520
<i>the main stage, where we'll be</i>
<i>joined by our extra-special</i>
<i>guest judge--Bible--</i>

22:36.522 --> 22:40.858
<i>[heavenly music]</i>
<i>Khloe Kardashian.</i>
<i>[All gasping]</i>

22:40.860 --> 22:44.895
<i> My idol, khloe Kardashian.</i>

22:44.897 --> 22:50.534
<i>I'm in heaven.</i>
<i> Are you keeping up?</i>
<i>Don't fuck it up.</i>

22:50.536 --> 22:54.305
<i> Coming up...</i>

22:54.307 --> 22:55.106
<i> I'm thinking about wearing</i>

22:55.108 --> 22:57.241
<i>facial hair.</i>

22:57.243 --> 22:57.908
<i> Really, queenie?</i>

22:57.910 --> 23:00.244
<i>I hope you packed.</i>

23:00.246 --> 23:00.911
<i> You think this represents</i>

23:00.913 --> 23:01.779
<i>you?</i>

23:01.781 --> 23:02.646
<i> I can't even begin.</i>

23:02.648 --> 23:03.447
<i> You've got to bring it every</i>

And these are my shoes.

24:22.161 --> 24:26.497
No one's ever seen a
quinceanera quite like this.
In this challenge, I may be

24:26.499 --> 24:29.700
underestimated by the other
queens.
But I plan on being the black

24:29.702 --> 24:32.603
horse in this competition.

24:32.605 --> 24:45.416
Oh, it is dark horse, isn't

<i>girl.</i>
<i> Oh, honey, it's stolen.</i>

30:33.399 --> 30:37.601
<i>It's gone.</i>
<i>I do think that your eye makeup</i>
<i>is a little too heavy, 'cause I</i>

30:37.603 --> 30:41.772
<i>don't feel like I could see your</i>
<i>eyes as much as I would like to.</i>
<i> It's just a softening of the</i>

<i>edges.</i>
<i>But those dimples are</i>
<i>everything.</i>

30:45.211 --> 30:47.811

<i>boring here.</i>
<i> I have a very big camel toe.</i>
<i>My pussy is very large and in</i>

<i>charge.</i>
<i>I'm a big girl.</i>
<i>I embrace it, though.</i>

31:07.967 --> 31:14.004
<i>But I cannot have ruching in</i>
<i>front of my body, because it's</i>
<i>just gonna accentuate my pussy.</i>

31:14.006 --> 31:21.044
<i>I wish your outfit was stronger.</i>
<i> Next up, Magnolia Crawford.</i>
<i> My eyes honed right in on</i>

31:21.046 --> 31:25.649
<i>that nose contour.</i>
<i>It is so dark, girl.</i>
<i> And that dress, it's very</i>

31:25.651 --> 31:28.485
<i>basic.</i>
<i>It's, like, so--</i>
<i> I don't think that this print</i>

31:28.487 --> 31:32.756
<i>is basic.</i>
<i> But you think this represents</i>
<i>you?</i>

31:32.758 --> 31:38.462
<i> Yes, because I am attracted</i>
<i>to things that are so ugly</i>
<i>they're fabulous.</i>

31:38.464 --> 31:41.899
<i> You're not giving me that.</i>
<i> I--</i>
<i> that's not ugly.</i>

31:41.901 --> 31:48.238
<i> But I didn't like my box.</i>
<i>There's only so much you can do</i>
<i>with red and white check.</i>

31:48.240 --> 31:50.874
<i> The thing is, you could've</i>
<i>done more.</i>
<i> I've got a goddamn bow on my</i>

31:50.876 --> 31:55.479
<i>ass.</i>
<i> I get this angry vibe from</i>
<i>you.</i>

31:55.481 --> 32:00.651
<i> I--okay.</i>
<i> This is the motherfucking</i>
<i>Olympics, girl.</i>

32:00.653 --> 32:03.287
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> You've got to bring it every</i>

<i> She didn't wear anything from</i>

<i> You're beautiful.</i>
<i>You don't need all of that.</i>

32:27.947 --> 32:32.683
<i>Cut it in half.</i>
<i> Next up, Courtney Act.</i>
<i> G'day.</i>

32:32.685 --> 32:39.423
<i> You're giving me Cheryl</i>
<i>tiegs,</i> <i>cosmo</i> cover, 1976.
I honestly want to just skin

32:39.425 --> 32:44.261
you alive and wear your body.
Your body is phenomenal.
I did notice that you were

32:44.263 --> 32:48.198
tripping up a little bit on your
skirt.
It's just too long, I think.

32:48.200 --> 32:55.939
Thank you, Courtney.
Last but not least, Milk.
So, Milk, do you think this

32:55.941 --> 33:00.377
is representative of who you
are?
Yeah.

33:00.379 --> 33:05.482
I have a very quirky persona and
style.
I know I'm not gonna ever fit in

33:05.484 --> 33:11.788
with those glamorous queens.
And so why not stand out?
You probably could've left

33:11.790 --> 33:19.596
off the beard, 'cause really,
the whole ensemble looks like a
million dollars.

33:19.598 --> 33:23.200
Really, it's like a fashion
illustration just right off the
page.

33:23.202 --> 33:27.004
You are owning everything of
who you are.
That's what I love.

33:27.006 --> 33:32.009
All right, thank you.
Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck in the

33:32.011 --> 33:37.547
formdecor lounge, the judges and
I will deliberate.
[Engine revs]

33:37.549 --> 33:44.821
All right, just between us
squirrel friends, let's start
with Trinity Kardashian bonet.

33:44.823 --> 33:50.027
I love Trinity's creativity
and that Trinity brought an
entire performance to the

33:50.029 --> 33:54.197
Runway.
After she took the pizza box
off from her neck, I thought she

33:54.199 --> 33:58.602
was fierce.
Bianca Del Rio.
Love that dress.

33:58.604 --> 34:03.440
I would wear that dress.
I loved her sense of humor.
She's a queen I'll be watching.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.943
The only critique is the
makeup.
You got to blend.

34:06.945 --> 34:10.113
Sissy that face.
You better sissy that face,
girl.

34:10.115 --> 34:13.650
Darienne Lake.
She's stunningly gorgeous.
Yeah.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.986
But it looked like she went
to the fancy section at dress
barn.

34:15.988 --> 34:20.457
Unforgivable is the ruching.
The coochie ruching.
Oh, my God.

34:20.459 --> 34:24.895
The puffy pussy.
I can't deal.
Magnolia Crawford.

34:24.897 --> 34:30.100
Girl, if you're gonna wear
a cow print, you better camp the
hell out of that dress.

34:30.102 --> 34:33.303
Sure.
Wear a bell around your neck.
It's interesting watching

34:33.305 --> 34:36.973
Magnolia Crawford get so
defensive.
I totally relate to it.

34:36.975 --> 34:40.744
I've been there myself.
I get irritated when they
talk about my marriage or my

34:40.746 --> 34:43.613
sisters.
Sure.
But I want to be a better

34:43.615 --> 34:47.884
version of me.
That takes constant work.
And if you're gonna be

34:47.886 --> 34:50.954
defensive, then it defeats
the point.
All right.

34:50.956 --> 34:54.958
Let's move on to Joslyn Fox.
I don't know if I could
forgive that outfit.

34:54.960 --> 34:59.129
The midsection had no shape.
I don't mind that outfit.
It's not like she's coming out

34:59.131 --> 35:02.232
here in a career woman, and,
you know, like--
no, but the construction was

35:02.234 --> 35:06.636
just a disaster.
Courtney Act.
There was not much going on

35:06.638 --> 35:10.807
to that outfit.
So she definitely was relying on
her body, which, hey, if you've

35:10.809 --> 35:13.176
got it, rely on it.
Yeah.
Do whatever you can.

35:13.178 --> 35:17.948
But I just would expect a lot
more from her.
All right, let's move on.

35:17.950 --> 35:23.687
Who wants Milk?
Hopefully, Milk will be able
to make the look more feminine

35:23.689 --> 35:26.957
when we ask her.
With that said, I thought it
was a ballsy move to come out

35:26.959 --> 35:30.360
with a beard.
I like a big set of balls.
Yeah, girl.

35:30.362 --> 35:33.964
You know, honey, please.
[Claps]
Silence.

35:33.966 --> 35:39.302
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.103
[Engine revs]

35:40.105 --> 35:42.405
[Laughs]

35:42.407 --> 35:46.810
[Laughs]

35:46.812 --> 35:52.682
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
[Suspenseful music]

35:52.684 --> 36:01.825
Trinity K. Bonet...
You're safe.
Bianca Del Rio, your couture was

36:01.827 --> 36:08.198
a real Maui wowie.
Condragulations.
You're the winner of this week's

36:08.200 --> 36:12.335
challenge.
[Applause]
You've won a $2,500 shopping

36:12.337 --> 36:25.749
spree from fabric planet.
Milk, for not playing it safe,
you're safe.

36:25.751 --> 36:32.722
Courtney Act...
Body, ten.
Couture, six.

36:32.724 --> 36:39.829
You're safe.
Magnolia Crawford.
Your bovine design was not

36:39.831 --> 36:45.302
divine.
Where's the beef?
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are

36:45.304 --> 36:54.277
up for elimination.
Darienne Lake, your face is
painted for the ages.

36:54.279 --> 37:02.586
But your ruche looked rushed.
Joslyn Fox, your couture reminds
me of a wedding.

37:02.588 --> 37:07.457
Something old, something new,
something borrowed, something
blue...

37:07.459 --> 37:14.764
Green, yellow, pink, red,
chartreuse.
Joslyn Fox...

37:14.766 --> 37:18.935
You're safe.
Thank you.

37:18.937 --> 37:27.644
Darienne, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
It's just me and Magnolia.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.312
Give me the firing squad.

37:29.314 --> 37:30.313
I'm ready.

37:30.315 --> 37:39.889
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself

37:39.891 --> 37:44.761
from elimination.
The time has come...
[Thunder rumbles]

37:44.763 --> 37:49.799
For you to lip-sync
for your life.
[Dramatic music]

37:49.801 --> 37:56.072
good luck.
And don't fuck it up.

37:57.743 --> 38:01.111
turn the beat around

38:01.113 --> 38:07.617
love to hear percussion
flute player
play your flute 'cause

38:07.619 --> 38:12.322
I know that you
wanna get your thing off
but you see

38:12.324 --> 38:16.793
I've made up my mind
about it, huh
got to be the rhythm

38:16.795 --> 38:21.598
no doubt about it
whoa, whoa
turn the beat around

38:21.600 --> 38:24.901
I'm going, I'm going
I'm going, going, gone
love to hear percussion

38:24.903 --> 38:28.738
move your feet
when you feel the beat, yeah
turn it upside down

38:28.740 --> 38:34.477
I'm gonna show the judges
that I'm funny, fabulous, and
that I have a great nose.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.913
When the guitar player
starts playing with the
syncopated rhythm with the

38:36.915 --> 38:40.050
scratch, scratch, scratch
makes me wanna move
I am looking those judges

38:40.052 --> 38:44.154
dead in their eye and getting
that glance right back.
This is what you paid for.

38:44.156 --> 38:47.457
And I'm giving you extra.
rat tat tat tat tat tat
on the drums

38:47.459 --> 38:54.130
hey
whoa
turn the beat around

38:54.132 --> 39:01.438
love to hear percussion
whoo!
turn the beat around

39:01.440 --> 39:07.744
turn it around, yeah
love to hear percussion
[Applause]

39:07.746 --> 39:13.450
[Laughs]
All right, ladies,
I've made my decision.

39:13.452 --> 39:21.925
[Suspenseful music]
Darienne Lake...

39:21.927 --> 39:31.101
Shante, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Thank you.

39:31.103 --> 39:36.272
Magnolia Crawford, you hit a
wall.
But there's one thing I know for

39:36.274 --> 39:45.081
sure.
You can't keep a good ho down.
Now, sashay away.

39:45.083 --> 39:53.423
Thank you.
It's a shame they didn't get to
love me as much as I love me.

39:53.425 --> 39:58.161
Yeah, I might have come across
a little abrasive.
The thing is, all publicity is

39:58.163 --> 40:02.332
good publicity.
So I'm gonna take it and run
with it.

40:02.334 --> 40:05.402
Peace the fuck out.

40:05.404 --> 40:16.579
Condragulations, ladies.
Enjoy this moment, because there
are six more fierce queens ready

40:16.581 --> 40:24.788
to snatch the crown.
Bitches better beware.
[Dramatic Western music]

40:24.790 --> 40:34.864
[Whip cracks]

40:34.866 --> 40:36.900
Oh, fuck.

40:36.902 --> 40:39.803
The six other bitches.

40:39.805 --> 40:42.505
It's like two prides of lions

40:42.507 --> 40:43.440
meeting each other on the

40:43.442 --> 40:44.941
serengeti.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.643
This is like <i>the outsiders.</i>

40:46.645 --> 40:48.178
<i>I'm from azusa, okay?</i>

40:48.180 --> 40:49.012
<i>I know how street fights get</i>

40:49.014 --> 40:50.280
<i>down.</i>

40:50.282 --> 40:51.147
<i> They're all trying a little</i>

40:51.149 --> 40:52.715
<i>too hard for my tastes,</i>

40:52.717 --> 40:54.150
<i>especially that Kimora Lee</i>

40:54.152 --> 40:56.152
<i>Kardashian.</i>

40:56.154 --> 40:57.854
<i>I don't like them.</i>

40:57.856 --> 40:59.756
<i>Don't like them.</i>

40:59.758 --> 41:01.825
<i>[Whip cracks]</i>
