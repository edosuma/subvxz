WEBVTT

00:02.547 --> 00:03.745
- Greg.
- Larry.

00:03.814 --> 00:04.846
What's going on?

00:04.848 --> 00:06.049
Any idea why Marshal Haas

00:06.050 --> 00:07.417
called this special meeting?

00:07.418 --> 00:08.618
I don't know.

00:08.619 --> 00:09.619
Do you think she saw the video
we put on the Internet

00:09.620 --> 00:11.487
to lure Jimmy Figgis down here?

00:11.488 --> 00:13.656
"Corn Dog pewwwnd by Go Kart."

00:13.657 --> 00:16.259
It's "pwned,"
but that was really adorable.

00:16.260 --> 00:17.427
Well, if she has,

00:17.428 --> 00:19.329
it would ruin our entire plan.

00:19.330 --> 00:20.362
Here she comes.

00:23.968 --> 00:25.270
- Gentlemen.
- What's up?

00:25.302 --> 00:26.903
So how's it going?

00:26.904 --> 00:28.137
It's good.
It's really good.

00:28.138 --> 00:30.039
Uh, keeping a low prof.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.307
No contact with Brooklyn.

00:31.308 --> 00:32.475
No one's questioned
our identities.

00:32.476 --> 00:34.010
Definitely staying off the Net,

00:34.011 --> 00:35.478
right, Greg?

00:35.479 --> 00:37.280
- Right.
- That's it?

00:37.281 --> 00:38.982
That's all you have to say
to me?

00:38.983 --> 00:40.383
Yep, I think we're good.

00:40.384 --> 00:42.150
So nobody's going to ask me
how I'm doing?

00:42.219 --> 00:44.153
Oh, I didn't think this was
a personal conversation.

00:44.154 --> 00:46.155
It's not; turn back around
and watch the movie.

00:46.156 --> 00:47.490
This is official business.

00:47.491 --> 00:48.624
I was just testing you,

00:48.625 --> 00:50.860
because Greg is the kind of
person who cares

00:50.861 --> 00:54.864
about his friends and can sense
when something is off with them.

00:54.865 --> 00:58.701
Is something off with you,
Marshal Haas?

00:58.702 --> 00:59.702
I don't know.

00:59.703 --> 01:01.604
I mean, I met someone, okay,

01:01.605 --> 01:03.072
and, um...

01:03.073 --> 01:04.138
I mean, it's not my husband,

01:04.174 --> 01:06.809
I mean, nothing's happened yet,
but...

01:06.810 --> 01:09.645
My entire body is on fire.

01:09.646 --> 01:10.980
He's Cuban.

01:10.981 --> 01:11.956
Is this still official business?

01:11.957 --> 01:13.157
Of course it is.

01:13.158 --> 01:14.559
- Shut up and watch the movie.
- Yep.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.394
Pop quiz.

01:16.395 --> 01:18.229
If Larry were married
and everything was fine,

01:18.230 --> 01:20.589
and I mean, honestly,
everything is totally fine.

01:20.657 --> 01:21.657
Sure.

01:21.658 --> 01:23.201
But he knew that one night

01:23.202 --> 01:25.203
with this person could give him
everything he needed

01:25.204 --> 01:27.363
for the rest of his life.

01:27.364 --> 01:28.331
- Would he do it?
- Yes?

01:28.332 --> 01:30.266
Yes?
Good.

01:30.267 --> 01:32.001
What if this person that Larry
met was young?

01:32.002 --> 01:34.137
I mean, really young.

01:34.138 --> 01:36.105
Well, I don't think Larry
would do anything illegal.

01:36.106 --> 01:37.572
You know, it seems to me

01:37.608 --> 01:39.976
Larry has needs

01:39.977 --> 01:44.180
and deserves to have
those needs...

01:44.181 --> 01:46.616
met.

01:46.617 --> 01:49.152
Greg, you're really great
at being undercover.

01:49.153 --> 01:51.053
You both passed the test.

01:51.121 --> 01:52.691
Marco!

02:13.944 --> 02:15.243
<i>Guys, guys,</i>

02:15.312 --> 02:16.879
the marshal gave me good news
about Jake.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.346
Jake's back.
Jake's back!

02:18.415 --> 02:19.582
Oh, we're not ready.
We need gummy worms.

02:19.583 --> 02:20.716
We need them now!

02:20.717 --> 02:21.717
No, Charles.

02:21.718 --> 02:23.585
Jake is still wherever he is,

02:23.654 --> 02:25.521
but since it's been six months,

02:25.522 --> 02:27.790
the marshal is letting me write
a one-page letter to Jake

02:27.791 --> 02:30.460
which she will read to him
and then set on fire.

02:30.461 --> 02:31.893
Is there anything you guys
want me to write?

02:31.962 --> 02:34.163
You have to tell Jake about
my new son, Nikolaj.

02:34.164 --> 02:35.397
That he's four years old,

02:35.466 --> 02:36.466
he's from Latvia,

02:36.467 --> 02:37.467
he calls me "comrade,"

02:37.468 --> 02:38.834
and I love him so much.

02:38.902 --> 02:40.369
Will do.

02:40.370 --> 02:41.703
Rosa, anything you want
to tell Jake?

02:41.772 --> 02:44.774
Yeah.
Tell him I said...

02:44.775 --> 02:46.708
You want me to write
that you nodded slightly?

02:46.777 --> 02:47.776
He'll know what it means.

02:47.845 --> 02:49.846
I would like you to tell Jacob

02:49.847 --> 02:53.616
that I'm thinking about him
and hoping that he's safe.

02:53.617 --> 02:55.283
What?
Meet the new Gina,

02:55.352 --> 02:58.688
who always puts others
before herself.

02:58.689 --> 03:01.457
Can you make the whole letter
about me doing that?

03:01.458 --> 03:04.392
Yeah, I'll just tell him
that everything's exactly the same.

03:04.461 --> 03:06.562
Guys, briefing room,
five minutes.

03:06.563 --> 03:07.596
We're getting a new captain.

03:07.631 --> 03:08.630
Again!

03:10.300 --> 03:11.267
Hello, Larry.

03:11.268 --> 03:12.768
It's your neighbor, Greg.

03:12.769 --> 03:14.203
Can I try your hot tub out?

03:14.204 --> 03:16.439
I'm thinking of getting one.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.674
Of course, that's a totally
normal thing to do

03:18.675 --> 03:19.775
in 100 degree weather.

03:19.776 --> 03:21.644
Come on in and hop in the tub.

03:21.645 --> 03:24.012
Thank you.

03:24.081 --> 03:26.081
We need to talk without
being overheard.

03:26.150 --> 03:27.116
Turn on the bubbles.

03:27.117 --> 03:28.151
You got it.

03:30.187 --> 03:32.053
Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis
saw our video.

03:32.122 --> 03:33.488
How do you know?

03:33.524 --> 03:34.957
A man with a thick
New Jersey accent

03:34.958 --> 03:36.259
called the Fun Zone,

03:36.260 --> 03:38.960
asking to meet the guys
from "the corn dog video."

03:38.996 --> 03:40.830
Figgis is coming to kill us.

03:40.831 --> 03:42.064
We should call the Nine-Nine
for backup.

03:42.065 --> 03:43.298
Oh, absolutely not.

03:43.367 --> 03:45.067
That might alert the marshals.

03:45.068 --> 03:47.502
We can take Figgis and his
men down on our own.

03:47.571 --> 03:49.038
Right.

03:49.039 --> 03:50.306
Okay.

03:50.307 --> 03:52.208
Let's go arm up.

03:52.209 --> 03:54.776
Figgis has no idea
what's about to hit him.

03:54.845 --> 03:56.546
Also it probably goes
without saying,

03:56.547 --> 03:58.548
but it's chill to whiz
in this thing.

03:58.549 --> 04:00.215
I mean, I have been.
You can if you want.

04:00.284 --> 04:01.651
I haven't been if you haven't.

04:01.652 --> 04:03.219
Have you?
I haven't.

04:03.220 --> 04:04.152
Have you?

04:04.221 --> 04:05.755
We can't just waltz in there

04:05.756 --> 04:07.223
and buy whatever we want.

04:07.224 --> 04:08.357
They'll do a federal
background check

04:08.358 --> 04:10.193
on Greg Stickney
and Larry Sherbert,

04:10.194 --> 04:12.360
and that will set off alarms
in the marshal's office.

04:12.429 --> 04:15.097
No, we'll have to bribe
the gun store owner

04:15.098 --> 04:16.464
so he doesn't run our names.

04:16.466 --> 04:18.935
But we don't have any money.

04:18.935 --> 04:20.403
Oh, my God.

04:20.404 --> 04:21.970
I'm the bribe, aren't I?

04:22.039 --> 04:23.206
You're not the bribe.

04:23.207 --> 04:24.301
Why, what's wrong with my body?

04:24.341 --> 04:25.775
Actually I borrowed $3,000

04:25.776 --> 04:27.210
from my walking group
friend Ruth.

04:27.211 --> 04:28.344
Ruth, I'm going to be
straight with you.

04:28.345 --> 04:29.811
I accidentally
knocked up a woman.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.681
- Greg!
- You know me.

04:31.682 --> 04:34.584
I see a pair of thick
weighty breasts

04:34.585 --> 04:37.086
and all logic flies out
the window.

04:37.087 --> 04:40.890
Heterosexual you is such a dog.

04:41.892 --> 04:42.892
Can I help you?

04:42.893 --> 04:44.126
Ah, no thanks, just browsing.

04:44.127 --> 04:45.294
Although, you know what,

04:45.295 --> 04:46.729
since I'm here,
why don't I grab, like,

04:46.730 --> 04:49.432
eight handguns, couple of
shotguns, and, I don't know,

04:49.433 --> 04:51.133
three more handguns.

04:51.134 --> 04:52.201
Can I see some ID?

04:52.202 --> 04:54.103
Yes, of course, of course.

04:54.104 --> 04:56.439
Oh.
Would you look at that?

04:56.440 --> 04:57.540
I forgot my license,

04:57.541 --> 05:00.509
but I do happen to have
this big old wad...

05:00.510 --> 05:01.510
- No problem.
- Hmm?

05:01.511 --> 05:02.511
I don't need your ID.

05:02.512 --> 05:04.146
Federal database is down anyway.

05:04.147 --> 05:05.348
- Wink wink.
- Ah.

05:05.349 --> 05:06.791
So how do you like your ammo?

05:06.792 --> 05:07.858
By the box or by the bucket?

05:07.859 --> 05:08.851
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

05:08.852 --> 05:10.061
Our country is broken.

05:10.062 --> 05:11.429
- What?
- Bucket!

05:11.430 --> 05:13.964
I'll just take your biggest
bucket of bullets.

05:13.999 --> 05:15.265
Okay, everyone.

05:15.334 --> 05:17.134
We've been assigned
a new commander.

05:17.135 --> 05:18.760
Please give him a warm welcome.

05:20.264 --> 05:21.264
Hey, guys.

05:21.265 --> 05:22.531
I'm Captain Stentley.

05:22.532 --> 05:25.301
Ah, yuck, that sounds so formal.

05:25.302 --> 05:26.969
Um...

05:26.970 --> 05:28.237
Captain Jason.

05:28.238 --> 05:29.739
No.

05:29.740 --> 05:30.906
Call me C.J.

05:30.907 --> 05:32.274
Okay, so that's all I got,

05:32.342 --> 05:33.409
unless you guys have
any questions.

05:33.410 --> 05:35.151
Yeah, you wearing sweat pants?

05:35.212 --> 05:36.445
No.
Oh, yes.

05:37.447 --> 05:38.546
Yes, I am.

05:38.582 --> 05:40.850
I, um, had some hot cocoa
this morning,

05:40.851 --> 05:42.550
and I totally biffed it.

05:42.586 --> 05:43.853
I like this guy.

05:43.854 --> 05:44.794
Uh, if I may ask,

05:44.863 --> 05:46.922
how did you become captain?

05:46.923 --> 05:52.460
You just seem a little, uh...

05:52.529 --> 05:53.963
- Unqualified?
- No.

05:53.964 --> 05:54.929
No, no, no, no.

05:54.998 --> 05:56.374
It's because I am, actually.

05:56.375 --> 05:57.666
Here's how it happened.

05:57.734 --> 05:59.635
I had an appointment
at my dermatologist

05:59.636 --> 06:02.038
at 402 7th Avenue.

06:02.039 --> 06:05.808
But I went to 204 7th Avenue
by mistake.

06:05.809 --> 06:07.942
It's like numbers are so crazy,
am I right?

06:07.978 --> 06:09.053
- Amen.
- Not really.

06:09.054 --> 06:10.254
Anyway,

06:10.255 --> 06:11.255
there was this big drug bust
going down.

06:11.256 --> 06:13.424
I showed up,
spooked the kingpin.

06:13.425 --> 06:16.127
He darts for the front door,
trips,

06:16.128 --> 06:18.496
shoots himself in the stomach
accidentally,

06:18.497 --> 06:20.698
and then after that everybody
pretty much surrendered

06:20.699 --> 06:23.334
very quickly and they made me
a captain about a week later.

06:23.335 --> 06:25.403
Didn't you have to pass
the exams?

06:25.404 --> 06:27.171
Like, wasn't there, like,
an interview

06:27.172 --> 06:29.373
where they met you and...

06:29.374 --> 06:30.607
heard you speak?

06:30.642 --> 06:31.775
Presumably.

06:31.843 --> 06:33.343
Look, I'm going to be honest.

06:33.378 --> 06:34.512
Between you and me,

06:34.513 --> 06:35.546
I don't fully know
what I'm doing,

06:35.547 --> 06:37.138
but it seems like you guys do,

06:37.207 --> 06:38.873
so I'm just gonna stay out
of the way

06:38.942 --> 06:40.676
and give you guys
whatever you need.

06:40.677 --> 06:42.945
Ceej?
Hi, Gina Linetti here.

06:42.946 --> 06:45.047
What I need is an assistant
of my own,

06:45.048 --> 06:47.116
just to do my paperwork
and all my other work.

06:47.117 --> 06:48.617
Work is the worst.
I get it.

06:48.618 --> 06:50.030
Uh.
Hire whoever you want.

06:50.087 --> 06:52.021
I just want you guys
to be happy.

06:52.022 --> 06:53.889
- And I will help you with that.
- Great!

06:53.890 --> 06:56.492
Hey, we should do a hang sesh
like this every morning.

06:56.493 --> 06:58.494
This is amazing.
Where do ya...

06:58.495 --> 06:59.427
where's my office?

06:59.496 --> 07:01.539
I love him.

07:01.540 --> 07:03.199
He's the best captain
we've ever had,

07:03.200 --> 07:04.240
hands down.

07:07.037 --> 07:08.404
I don't know what you're
so excited about.

07:08.405 --> 07:10.139
We have dangerous task
ahead of us.

07:10.140 --> 07:12.541
Wait, I thought you said
we didn't need backup.

07:12.542 --> 07:14.142
Are you worried? Do we need
to call the Nine-Nine?

07:14.211 --> 07:15.211
No, no, no, no.

07:15.212 --> 07:16.379
We have the drop on Figgis,

07:16.380 --> 07:17.813
we're fully armed up,

07:17.814 --> 07:20.316
and we have plenty of time
to lay a trap.

07:20.317 --> 07:21.584
Well, okay, then.

07:21.585 --> 07:23.619
See you around, Coral Palms.

07:23.620 --> 07:26.354
Adios, constant pool of sweat
in my taint!

07:26.423 --> 07:27.656
You do one, Greg.

07:27.657 --> 07:28.657
All right.

07:28.658 --> 07:29.658
See you never,

07:29.659 --> 07:31.961
drive-through vape station.

07:31.962 --> 07:34.029
Adios, weird Juggalo encampment!

07:34.030 --> 07:36.034
Bye-bye, slightly askew
stop sign.

07:36.066 --> 07:37.533
Whoa-oh.

07:37.534 --> 07:39.868
Oh, come on,
for running a stop sign?

07:39.936 --> 07:41.070
We just passed someone driving

07:41.071 --> 07:42.704
with both feet out the window.

07:42.739 --> 07:45.441
Just be cool, Larry.

07:45.442 --> 07:46.876
Gentlemen.

07:46.877 --> 07:49.044
I am going to need to see
your license and registration.

07:49.045 --> 07:50.179
Yeah.

07:50.180 --> 07:51.347
Whoa, hold on.

07:51.348 --> 07:53.015
What do we got going on
back there?

07:53.016 --> 07:55.417
Oh, uh, yesterday's newspaper.

07:55.485 --> 07:56.886
No, I'm talking about
the pile of guns

07:56.887 --> 07:58.287
and the bucket of bullets.

07:58.288 --> 08:00.022
- Right, right, right.
- Right, right, yeah.

08:00.023 --> 08:01.357
Bucket of bullets, sure, sure.

08:01.358 --> 08:02.590
I need you both to step out
of the vehicle.

08:02.659 --> 08:03.895
Yep, it'd be weird
if you didn't.

08:04.155 --> 08:05.752
This is a little bit weird.

08:05.820 --> 08:06.887
Never been arrested before.

08:06.888 --> 08:08.555
I mean, I was "detained" once

08:08.556 --> 08:10.023
by Taylor Swift's security team,

08:10.024 --> 08:11.925
but that was a misunderstanding.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.560
She's probably going to write
a song about me.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.262
We got to get out of here.

08:15.263 --> 08:16.830
Figgis could show up
at any minute.

08:16.831 --> 08:17.865
Don't worry.

08:17.866 --> 08:19.400
We can outsmart some
small-town sheriff.

08:19.401 --> 08:20.768
We're NYPD detectives.

08:20.769 --> 08:21.802
We caught the Son of Sam.

08:21.803 --> 08:23.437
Ice-T plays us on TV.

08:23.438 --> 08:25.072
We keep the Tony's safe.

08:25.073 --> 08:26.073
Hey, fellas.

08:26.074 --> 08:28.008
Listen, I am sorry about
the delay.

08:28.009 --> 08:31.378
We are overwhelmed here today.

08:31.379 --> 08:32.913
We hired our first woman,

08:32.914 --> 08:34.648
so of course she needs
her own bathroom

08:34.649 --> 08:35.816
and the shirt don't fit right...

08:35.817 --> 08:37.518
both things chaos.

08:37.519 --> 08:39.119
It's not a problem, Sheriff.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.554
You have nothing to worry about.

08:41.556 --> 08:43.557
I think we all agree that C.J.

08:43.558 --> 08:45.292
is, to put it mildly,

08:45.293 --> 08:46.460
not very impressive.

08:46.461 --> 08:47.561
I watched him try to close
the blinds

08:47.562 --> 08:49.663
in his office for 40 minutes.

08:49.664 --> 08:51.507
He finally just gave up
and changed his pants

08:51.508 --> 08:52.875
with the windows wide open.

08:52.876 --> 08:54.401
Something has to be done,

08:54.402 --> 08:55.736
and I have a plan.

08:55.737 --> 08:57.679
We use mankind's
greatest weapon.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.081
- A grenade.
- The written word.

08:59.082 --> 09:00.073
Ugh, I'm out.

09:00.074 --> 09:01.074
I drafted a letter

09:01.075 --> 09:02.084
to One Police Plaza saying

09:02.085 --> 09:03.243
that we think Captain Stentley

09:03.244 --> 09:04.620
is not a good fit
for our precinct.

09:04.621 --> 09:06.980
If we all sign it,
they'll have to act.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.982
Hey, guys, I'm Emily,
Gina's assistant.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.617
Wait, she actually got that?

09:10.618 --> 09:12.219
"Wait, she actually got that?"

09:12.220 --> 09:14.363
Sorry, I'm under strict orders
from Gina

09:14.364 --> 09:16.430
to mock you whenever
I see an opening.

09:16.466 --> 09:18.066
Follow me, please.

09:18.067 --> 09:20.327
Your 2:00 is here.

09:20.328 --> 09:21.537
Okay, thanks, Em,

09:21.538 --> 09:22.663
and while I'm in this meeting,

09:22.664 --> 09:24.773
will you just shred
some documents for me?

09:24.774 --> 09:26.108
Anything you see.
It's all garbage.

09:26.109 --> 09:27.409
On it.

09:27.410 --> 09:29.378
What's going on?
We were busy.

09:29.379 --> 09:31.213
Busy trying to ruin
everything around here

09:31.214 --> 09:32.314
with your dumb letter?

09:32.315 --> 09:34.149
This is a gravy train, people.

09:34.150 --> 09:36.985
Okay, C.J. will say yes
to anything we ask for.

09:36.986 --> 09:39.388
Rosa, dare to dream.
What do you want?

09:39.389 --> 09:40.856
For him to be gone.

09:40.857 --> 09:43.358
You want that more than you
want walls around your desk

09:43.359 --> 09:44.893
so Hitchcock can't stare at you

09:44.894 --> 09:46.487
with his big old Google eyes
anymore?

09:46.488 --> 09:47.896
C.J. stays.
I love that guy.

09:47.897 --> 09:48.931
- Yes!
- What?

09:48.932 --> 09:49.932
- That's not fair!
- Come on.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.667
And how about you, Charles?

09:51.668 --> 09:53.302
What do you want, baby boy?

09:53.303 --> 09:54.570
Well, I agree with Amy

09:54.571 --> 09:56.597
that C.J. is totally unqualified

09:56.598 --> 09:58.106
and a disaster for the precinct,

09:58.107 --> 09:59.942
and I would really love
a treadmill desk

09:59.943 --> 10:01.276
so I can hit my cardio targets.

10:01.277 --> 10:02.510
- Done.
- Yes!

10:02.579 --> 10:04.146
- Boyle.
- I'm sorry.

10:04.147 --> 10:05.614
I'm doing it for Nikolaj.

10:05.615 --> 10:08.617
You'll understand once you bear
unto Jake a child.

10:09.719 --> 10:11.920
Looks like you're all alone.

10:11.921 --> 10:13.689
Em, can you go ahead
and show her out?

10:13.690 --> 10:14.790
Right this way, please,

10:14.791 --> 10:15.791
and can I validate your parking?

10:15.792 --> 10:16.992
I work here.

10:16.993 --> 10:17.960
So, listen, do you mind

10:17.961 --> 10:18.994
if I ask you a few questions?

10:18.995 --> 10:20.395
It shouldn't take much time.

10:20.396 --> 10:22.364
Great, because we actually
have someplace

10:22.365 --> 10:23.297
important to be,

10:23.366 --> 10:24.666
so if it would speed things up,

10:24.667 --> 10:26.034
we're happy to waive
our right to counsel.

10:26.035 --> 10:27.402
Wow, counsel,

10:27.403 --> 10:29.171
the "C" word.

10:29.172 --> 10:30.439
Wait, wait, wait.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.772
You guys in law enforcement?

10:31.841 --> 10:32.841
No, no, no.

10:32.842 --> 10:33.876
I just have a buddy

10:33.877 --> 10:35.644
who's a detective in the NYPD.

10:35.645 --> 10:37.079
Whoo, I bet he's better than me

10:37.080 --> 10:38.413
at getting people to talk.

10:38.414 --> 10:39.748
Everything I know about
interrogation

10:39.749 --> 10:41.650
I learned from
"The Newlywed Game."

10:41.651 --> 10:42.684
Huh.

10:42.685 --> 10:43.785
So, look, why don't you each

10:43.786 --> 10:45.787
write down your answer
to these questions.

10:45.788 --> 10:47.456
Okay, question one,

10:47.457 --> 10:49.590
what were you going to use
the guns for?

10:49.659 --> 10:52.193
Okay, and then read 'em out
when you're done.

10:52.262 --> 10:53.495
Hunting.

10:53.496 --> 10:55.163
Okay, see, I knew you boys
were on the level.

10:55.164 --> 10:57.266
Okay, question two:

10:57.267 --> 10:58.232
What do you hunt?

11:01.571 --> 11:03.338
- Deer.
- Grouse and other small fowl.

11:03.339 --> 11:04.907
- Oh.
- Yep, we hunt everything.

11:04.908 --> 11:06.241
You know, deer, grouse,

11:06.242 --> 11:07.242
a horse once.

11:07.243 --> 11:10.112
Yes, we love killing any animal.

11:10.113 --> 11:11.647
I hear ya.

11:11.648 --> 11:13.282
Okay, question three:

11:13.283 --> 11:14.917
You said you had
somewhere important to go,

11:14.918 --> 11:17.088
so where exactly is that?

11:20.393 --> 11:21.656
- Dinner date.
- Dinner date.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.225
That's what mine says as well.

11:23.226 --> 11:24.359
Sorry about the handwriting.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.828
The point is, neither of us
are lying.

11:26.829 --> 11:28.288
Should we just pick up our keys
on the way out,

11:28.289 --> 11:30.265
or how do you want to do this?

11:31.893 --> 11:35.329
No one has ever beaten
"The Newlywed Game."

11:35.330 --> 11:37.339
No one.

11:37.340 --> 11:39.433
Hey, Diaz.

11:39.434 --> 11:42.636
Right.
The walls.

11:47.208 --> 11:48.275
Can I help you?

11:48.276 --> 11:49.910
I need the crime stats
from last month.

11:49.911 --> 11:51.143
Fine.
One sec.

11:54.415 --> 11:55.877
Some people, huh?

11:55.917 --> 11:57.985
Hey, I'm up to 20,000 steps.

11:57.986 --> 11:59.119
Seriously, Boyle?

11:59.120 --> 12:01.321
Oh, you don't care
about my health?

12:01.322 --> 12:03.457
You don't care about if Nikolaj
grows up without a papa?

12:03.458 --> 12:04.458
You want me to die?

12:04.459 --> 12:06.325
Honestly?
A little.

12:06.394 --> 12:07.727
Hurts.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.930
I can't believe they all
let C.J. and Gina

12:09.931 --> 12:11.298
just buy them off.

12:11.299 --> 12:12.299
But we don't need them,

12:12.300 --> 12:13.500
'cause we've got you,

12:13.501 --> 12:14.601
and you're a sergeant.

12:14.602 --> 12:15.602
Did you sign the letter yet?

12:15.603 --> 12:17.637
Um...
I...

12:17.705 --> 12:19.172
What did he give you?

12:19.173 --> 12:21.308
He gave me the ability to
continue to serve this community

12:21.309 --> 12:23.877
unencumbered by
a necessary oversight.

12:23.878 --> 12:24.978
Now, I really have to...

12:24.979 --> 12:26.179
What did he give you?

12:26.180 --> 12:27.947
He gave me a yogurt fridge,
all right?

12:28.016 --> 12:30.550
I asked for a yogurt fridge,
and I got one,

12:30.551 --> 12:32.285
right next to my desk!

12:32.286 --> 12:33.286
I'm only a man.

12:33.287 --> 12:34.554
I'm sending this letter

12:34.555 --> 12:37.924
with or without your signature.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.861
Enjoy your blood yogurt.

12:40.862 --> 12:42.294
I will.

12:42.363 --> 12:43.697
Time is running out.

12:43.698 --> 12:44.765
We have the right
to a phone call.

12:44.766 --> 12:46.099
We need to call the Nine-Nine

12:46.100 --> 12:47.401
so they can sort this out
with the sheriff.

12:47.402 --> 12:48.735
No, they would want
to get involved

12:48.736 --> 12:49.870
and that could endanger them.

12:49.871 --> 12:51.138
They'd be okay with that.

12:51.139 --> 12:52.339
Charles and Amy both love me.

12:52.340 --> 12:53.473
Rosa's not scared of anything.

12:53.474 --> 12:54.875
I'm like a mentor to Terry.

12:54.876 --> 12:56.143
No, regardless, we don't have
time for that.

12:56.144 --> 12:57.210
We just have to tell the truth.

12:57.211 --> 13:00.179
Sheriff, I'm ready to talk.

13:00.248 --> 13:01.348
This better be good.

13:01.349 --> 13:02.382
I'm a busy man.

13:02.383 --> 13:03.450
You just spent 30 minutes

13:03.451 --> 13:04.751
trying to win a radio contest.

13:04.752 --> 13:06.053
For my wife.

13:06.054 --> 13:07.487
They're giving away
Swampsgiving tickets.

13:07.488 --> 13:08.855
I'm not really Greg,

13:08.856 --> 13:10.023
and that's not Larry.

13:10.024 --> 13:11.992
We're Captain Raymond Holt

13:11.993 --> 13:14.594
and Detective Jake Peralta
of the NYPD.

13:14.595 --> 13:16.530
We've been targeted by
Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis,

13:16.531 --> 13:17.864
the mafia boss.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.266
We're in witness protection,

13:19.267 --> 13:21.902
and that is the full truth.

13:25.406 --> 13:28.041
Good one.
That's a good one.

13:28.042 --> 13:30.210
Just call the U.S. marshal
who handles our case.

13:30.211 --> 13:31.445
She'll explain everything.

13:31.446 --> 13:33.714
She?
Oh, come on.

13:33.715 --> 13:35.716
This is getting crazier
by the second.

13:35.717 --> 13:39.419
But I'll tell you, I kind of
want to see how it plays out.

13:39.420 --> 13:41.755
Uh-huh.
Right.

13:41.756 --> 13:43.590
Okay, will do.

13:43.591 --> 13:45.058
Well, it's a guy,

13:45.059 --> 13:47.094
and he says he's never heard of
either one of you.

13:47.095 --> 13:49.663
- That's impossible.
- Listen for yourself.

13:49.664 --> 13:52.365
- Hello.
-<i> It's Figgis.</i>

13:52.366 --> 13:54.868
<i>I have your marshal,
and I'm coming for you.</i>

13:54.869 --> 13:56.436
<i>See you soon, Jake.</i>

13:56.437 --> 13:57.437
Wait.

14:01.709 --> 14:03.577
Great news.

14:03.578 --> 14:05.544
I found Figgis.

14:06.356 --> 14:07.753
This is bad.

14:07.754 --> 14:08.754
Figgis has the marshal,

14:08.755 --> 14:10.021
and now he knows where we are.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.090
We're sitting ducks.

14:11.091 --> 14:12.190
That's the worst kind of duck.

14:12.259 --> 14:13.726
Tell that to the Dutch Hookbill.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.660
Look, the clock is ticking.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.763
We only have one option.

14:17.764 --> 14:18.998
Jailbreak.

14:18.999 --> 14:20.563
And how do you propose
to pull that off?

14:20.567 --> 14:23.502
By using this rag-tag team
of inmates.

14:23.503 --> 14:26.639
Our very Suicide Squad.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.972
All right, let's rally
the troops.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.475
Hey, fellow prisoners.

14:30.535 --> 14:31.535
Hi, there.

14:31.536 --> 14:32.536
Everyone, look,

14:32.537 --> 14:33.604
we haven't connected as much

14:33.605 --> 14:34.605
as maybe we should have.

14:34.606 --> 14:35.639
That's our fault.

14:35.640 --> 14:36.941
Why don't I just
kick things off.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.509
I'm Jake,

14:38.510 --> 14:39.643
and I like baseball.

14:39.644 --> 14:41.478
Now you say something
about yourself.

14:41.479 --> 14:43.681
I'm Raymond.
I don't care for baseball.

14:43.682 --> 14:46.216
Great, so now that we're all
vibing at 100,

14:46.284 --> 14:47.451
quick question:

14:47.452 --> 14:50.487
If there were to a be
a jailbreak "of sorts,"

14:50.488 --> 14:52.623
how many of you guys would be
interested in that?

14:52.624 --> 14:54.491
Obviously if you have any
moral objection...

14:54.492 --> 14:56.293
okay, your hands are already
all up,

14:56.294 --> 14:57.628
so I say we hop on this pony.
Great.

14:57.629 --> 14:59.196
Now, do any of you have
any special skills?

14:59.197 --> 15:00.863
Maybe the ability
to pick a lock?

15:00.899 --> 15:02.266
Uh, I'm Mitch.

15:02.267 --> 15:05.034
- I have a glass eye.
- Glass eye?

15:05.103 --> 15:07.805
We'll definitely find
some use for that.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.320
- How about you, sir?
- I'm Evan.

15:09.374 --> 15:10.908
I've been arrested
for a lot of different stuff:

15:10.909 --> 15:12.576
public urination,

15:12.577 --> 15:15.012
urinating on private property,

15:15.013 --> 15:16.947
urinating 25 feet from a school,

15:16.948 --> 15:18.849
urinating out of a moving truck.

15:18.850 --> 15:20.184
I don't think Evan gets
what we're doing here.

15:20.185 --> 15:21.185
Oh, doesn't he?

15:21.186 --> 15:22.353
He's been here for weeks.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.021
He knows the guard's comings
and goings.

15:24.022 --> 15:25.088
Thank you for sharing, Evan.

15:25.156 --> 15:26.356
You are valued here.

15:26.424 --> 15:27.491
Your turn, old-timer.

15:27.492 --> 15:28.424
It's always guys like this

15:28.493 --> 15:29.827
that unlock
the entire operation.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.028
What do you bring to the table?

15:31.029 --> 15:32.429
I'm Tito.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.465
I'm great at smoking meth.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.767
- And?
- Snorting meth.

15:36.768 --> 15:37.868
And?

15:37.869 --> 15:39.103
I haven't spoken to my daughter

15:39.104 --> 15:40.703
in a couple of years.

15:40.772 --> 15:41.839
Oh, that's so sad.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.107
Okay, so find something for Tito
to do.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.276
So I heard from
One Police Plaza.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.677
They received my letter,

15:46.678 --> 15:49.313
and apparently they also
received hundreds of others

15:49.314 --> 15:50.737
in support of C.J.

15:50.749 --> 15:53.284
Yeah, Emily and I sent those
in, so...

15:53.285 --> 15:56.487
Emily, what was that burn I had
you write down for Amy

15:56.488 --> 15:57.820
because I didn't want
to forget it?

15:57.889 --> 15:59.423
"Why so sad?

15:59.424 --> 16:00.858
"Did you just find out American
Girl doesn't make clothes

16:00.859 --> 16:01.859
in adult sizes?"

16:01.860 --> 16:02.860
No.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.128
"Steven Seagal called

16:04.129 --> 16:05.061
and he wants his ponytail back"?

16:05.130 --> 16:06.062
Huh-uh.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.131
Hey, Amy,

16:07.132 --> 16:08.698
"what did one
graphing calculator

16:08.767 --> 16:09.767
"say to the other one?

16:09.768 --> 16:10.840
What?

16:10.869 --> 16:13.704
What does the sad lady
own two of us?"

16:13.705 --> 16:15.239
That's it?

16:15.240 --> 16:16.673
- Hey, Amy...
- You know what?

16:16.708 --> 16:17.941
Congratulations.

16:17.942 --> 16:19.376
You just made sure
that a terrible captain

16:19.377 --> 16:21.178
will be sticking around here
indefinitely.

16:21.179 --> 16:22.560
Come on, Santiago.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.415
We're just trying to make
the best of it.

16:24.416 --> 16:25.649
- Yogurt?
- Never!

16:25.650 --> 16:27.051
Yes!
40,000 steps!

16:27.052 --> 16:28.552
- Boyle!
- I can't talk.

16:28.553 --> 16:29.859
I got to keep my heart rate up.

16:29.888 --> 16:31.722
Hey, can you guys keep it down?

16:31.723 --> 16:32.723
Need a roof on this thing.

16:32.724 --> 16:33.757
Gina, I need a roof.

16:33.758 --> 16:34.758
- Emily.
- On it.

16:34.759 --> 16:36.393
Listen, you selfish jerks,

16:36.394 --> 16:40.364
that guy in there, the one
playing the bongos right now,

16:40.365 --> 16:42.121
he thinks we're killing it,

16:42.133 --> 16:43.609
so he's just staying out
of our way.

16:43.610 --> 16:44.968
Well, the only reason
we're killing it

16:44.969 --> 16:46.537
is because Captain Holt
never let us

16:46.538 --> 16:47.937
be satisfied with ourselves.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.741
He always inspired us to work
harder and smarter,

16:50.742 --> 16:51.742
to be better.

16:51.743 --> 16:53.177
And if he were here right now,

16:53.178 --> 16:54.645
he'd be ashamed of us.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.347
Amy, wait!

16:56.348 --> 16:57.948
Oh!
Ah!

16:57.949 --> 16:59.983
Ooh, ah!

16:59.984 --> 17:01.894
You swear this guy's about
to meet up with his mistress?

17:01.895 --> 17:03.429
Yep.
Tuesday at 5:00.

17:03.430 --> 17:05.798
It's Tanya time.

17:05.799 --> 17:07.491
Well, there he goes.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.635
Okay, now we got to get rid
of the other deputy.

17:09.636 --> 17:12.737
Glass eye, you're up.

17:12.771 --> 17:15.406
Oh, so much drier
than I would have thought.

17:15.407 --> 17:16.407
Did I want it to be wet?

17:16.409 --> 17:17.643
- Jake!
- Right! Sorry.

17:17.644 --> 17:19.144
Just holding an eyeball
in my hand.

17:19.145 --> 17:20.278
No big deal.
Here we go.

17:22.515 --> 17:24.249
Yah.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.843
What the hell?

17:25.844 --> 17:27.411
Must have gotten too hot.

17:27.412 --> 17:29.146
Sheriff, I'm going to go
get a mop.

17:29.147 --> 17:30.180
<i>Okay.</i>

17:30.181 --> 17:31.215
And...
great.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.416
Now we stage a fight;

17:32.417 --> 17:33.550
when the sheriff comes in
to break it up,

17:33.551 --> 17:35.160
we take him down.

17:35.161 --> 17:36.887
Fight! Fight!
Fight!

17:36.888 --> 17:38.956
Ah!

17:39.966 --> 17:42.067
We got us a jail fight.

17:42.068 --> 17:43.260
Yah!

17:46.339 --> 17:47.706
Why isn't he coming in?

17:47.707 --> 17:49.108
I don't know,
maybe he's not buying it.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.774
Hit me harder.

17:51.811 --> 17:52.810
Oh!

17:52.879 --> 17:55.313
Damn, you knocked him.

17:57.917 --> 17:59.585
What would it take for him
to intervene?

17:59.586 --> 18:00.686
Do I actually have to kill you?

18:00.687 --> 18:01.820
No, he'd probably love that.

18:01.821 --> 18:02.821
Ugh!

18:02.822 --> 18:04.022
But you know what he would hate?

18:04.023 --> 18:06.725
Okay, just go with me
on this, all right?

18:06.726 --> 18:08.794
Ugh.

18:08.795 --> 18:10.562
I can't stay mad at you.

18:12.799 --> 18:15.167
Ooh!
No! No!

18:15.168 --> 18:16.935
- Is it working?
- I think so.

18:16.936 --> 18:18.570
Not in my jail.
No, no.

18:18.571 --> 18:21.840
Break it up!
Whoa!

18:21.841 --> 18:24.376
Stop it!
What are you doing?

18:24.377 --> 18:25.611
It's 2016, man.

18:25.612 --> 18:27.479
This is on you.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.047
Hey, wait a minute.

18:29.048 --> 18:30.682
You didn't give me
anything to do.

18:30.683 --> 18:32.851
You have the most important
job of all.

18:32.852 --> 18:34.720
Tell everyone
what you saw here today.

18:34.721 --> 18:36.054
Oh, God bless you.

18:36.055 --> 18:37.456
You're giving an old meth head

18:37.457 --> 18:39.258
a reason to live forever and...

18:39.259 --> 18:40.774
We don't have time for this,
Tito!

18:42.263 --> 18:43.330
Hey, Santiago,

18:43.331 --> 18:44.322
come with me a sec.

18:44.323 --> 18:45.323
Why?

18:45.324 --> 18:46.458
So you can show off

18:46.459 --> 18:48.260
some new cool thing
that C.J. got you?

18:48.261 --> 18:50.394
Let me guess, golden suspenders?

18:50.463 --> 18:53.331
Can you imagine?
I would look amazing.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.399
But that's not
what I came here for.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.802
Just follow me to
the captain's office.

18:57.803 --> 18:58.837
Hey, guys.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.138
If Pac-Man were a stapler,

19:00.139 --> 19:02.607
he'd look like a little
something like this.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.343
Okay, so we wanted to talk to
you, Captain Stentley...

19:05.344 --> 19:08.046
Uh-oh.
Captain Stentley.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.347
- Am I in trouble?
- No.

19:09.348 --> 19:10.348
You're our boss.

19:10.349 --> 19:11.716
Oh, right.

19:11.717 --> 19:12.717
Are you in trouble?

19:12.718 --> 19:13.718
No, sir.

19:13.719 --> 19:14.953
It's just that the squad feels

19:14.954 --> 19:16.221
we've been taking advantage
of you,

19:16.222 --> 19:17.222
and it has to stop.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.355
So...

19:18.424 --> 19:20.425
I returned my yogurt fridge.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.927
I gave my treadmill desk back.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.762
I took down my desk walls.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.197
And I have agreed to fire

19:25.198 --> 19:27.866
my assistant's assistant Dana.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.134
Dana?
Who's Dana?

19:29.135 --> 19:30.401
Emily had a lot on her plate.

19:30.436 --> 19:31.670
I don't understand.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.338
I mean, I'm just trying
to make you guys happy.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.573
Well, if you want to do that,

19:34.574 --> 19:36.775
start acting like
a real captain.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.210
Make tough choices.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.078
Tell people no sometimes.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.947
Okay, if you think I need
to stop doing

19:41.948 --> 19:44.115
whatever you guys want,

19:44.116 --> 19:45.650
then I will.

19:45.651 --> 19:46.952
Yeah, that's progress.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.485
If that's what you guys want.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.121
- I gotta go.
- Good talk.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.823
My door's always open,

19:51.824 --> 19:53.058
except when it's closed.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.726
But you can open it
when it's closed.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.819
I can't believe we're
fugitives on the lam,

19:59.865 --> 20:01.499
falsely accused of a crime.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.767
There's nothing false about it.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.403
We committed several felonies
and escaped from jail.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.439
Yeah, but we were just doing
what we had to do.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.441
We're the good guys.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.976
This is what they all think.

20:10.977 --> 20:11.977
Figgis is in town,

20:11.978 --> 20:13.545
and we have no car, no money,
no guns;

20:13.546 --> 20:14.846
we can't go back to our houses

20:14.847 --> 20:16.114
because the police
are looking for us.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.514
It's time to call the Nine-Nine.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.750
Absolutely not.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.085
What is going on with you?

20:20.086 --> 20:22.921
Nothing, I just think
that we can do it alone.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.558
Sir, we just shared one of
the longest kisses of my life.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.694
I think we can be honest
with each other.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.696
All right.

20:31.697 --> 20:34.240
The Nine-Nine bailed me out
once before

20:34.241 --> 20:35.800
when I was taken hostage by Bob,

20:35.801 --> 20:37.334
a man I had put my trust in,

20:37.403 --> 20:38.803
like a fool.

20:38.804 --> 20:41.239
I don't want them to
rescue me again.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.307
It's embarrassing.

20:42.308 --> 20:44.309
I need to clean up my own mess.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.977
Captain, it's the Nine-Nine.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.779
There's nothing wrong
with asking for help

20:47.780 --> 20:49.327
from people that care about you.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.687
This is Sergeant Terry Jeffords.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.834
Captain Holt!

20:56.889 --> 20:58.590
Sir.
Captain Stentley.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.091
There's an urgent situation,

21:00.092 --> 21:02.494
and we need 72 hours off
to go to Florida.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.528
Now, I can't why...

21:03.529 --> 21:04.729
Absolutely not.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.164
What?

21:06.165 --> 21:07.732
The Eight-Six said they would
cover for us,

21:07.733 --> 21:08.799
and this very important!

21:08.868 --> 21:09.800
That's enough.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.636
Someone once told me

21:11.637 --> 21:12.737
that being a captain means

21:12.738 --> 21:15.239
telling people no.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.807
Oh, wait. That was you guys.
You guys told me that.

21:17.808 --> 21:20.216
Anyway, you're right.
You can't go.

21:21.206 --> 21:22.706
Sorry, guys.

21:22.707 --> 21:24.451
I kinda feel
like this is my fault.

21:24.452 --> 21:26.314
I kinda feel
like this is my fault.

21:26.315 --> 21:27.490
Not now, Emily.
