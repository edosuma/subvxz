00:36.253 --> 00:39.082
Friends, I have
the most wonderful of news.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.171
I am going to become the rich.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.390
No way, mama!

00:42.433 --> 00:44.131
- What happened?
- Did you win the Lotto?

00:44.174 --> 00:46.133
Or a check from a rich uncle
or something?

00:46.176 --> 00:49.832
No. A foreign prince
e-mailed me an offer

00:49.875 --> 00:51.312
to share his vast fortune

00:51.355 --> 00:53.531
in exchange for the nominal fee.

00:53.575 --> 00:57.187
Oh, you got
one of <i>those</i> e-mails?

00:57.231 --> 00:59.320
You should just delete it, Star.

00:59.363 --> 01:01.583
I don't think doing business
with a foreign prince

01:01.626 --> 01:02.410
is a good idea.

01:02.453 --> 01:03.715
But it is the too late.

01:03.759 --> 01:06.109
I have already sent him
the money.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.197
You what?

01:07.241 --> 01:08.894
How much money
is we talking about?

01:08.938 --> 01:10.896
My entire life savings.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.377
You sent your entire
life savings to a stranger?

01:13.421 --> 01:15.336
On the Internet?

01:15.379 --> 01:17.599
He is not a stranger.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.296
He is the prince.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.211
And together
we shall use our money

01:21.255 --> 01:23.170
to open a store called

01:23.213 --> 01:25.389
Starfire's Scoops.

01:25.433 --> 01:29.132
So... you and this prince
are going to sell ice cream?

01:29.176 --> 01:31.308
No, that would be the boring.

01:31.352 --> 01:34.616
Our store will sell only
of the ice cream scoops

01:34.659 --> 01:36.748
and there
my gallant prince and I

01:36.792 --> 01:39.447
<i>shall live the happily
ever the after.</i>

01:39.490 --> 01:41.318
Well, I hate to burst
your bubble, Star,

01:41.362 --> 01:43.166
but I don't think
you're dealing
with a Prince Charming.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.148
You's dealing
with a scam artist, girl.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.889
I do not understand.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.760
What is the scam artist?

01:48.804 --> 01:51.372
A scam artist is a person
who intentionally deceives you

01:51.415 --> 01:53.765
<i>into giving them an unfair gain.</i>

01:55.202 --> 01:56.570
You see, the true purpose
of that e-mail

01:56.594 --> 01:58.248
was to trick you
into giving your money

01:58.292 --> 02:01.251
to someone who has no intention
of ever paying you back.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.558
So I shall not
be opening the store?

02:03.601 --> 02:04.689
I'm afraid not.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.648
You just lost
all your money, girl.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.392
I cannot believe
I was so easily deceived.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.481
Oh, when I find out
who did this,

02:13.524 --> 02:17.049
I shall make them regret
they were ever the born!

02:17.093 --> 02:18.399
Then pull up that e-mail

02:18.442 --> 02:20.009
and maybe we can help you
figure it out.

02:22.316 --> 02:23.317
This e-mail says

02:23.360 --> 02:25.406
it's from a Prince J. Reko
at AC.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.364
J. Reko?

02:27.408 --> 02:29.105
Hmm. That's it!

02:29.149 --> 02:30.541
What's it, bro?

02:30.585 --> 02:32.804
This e-mail was sent
by a prince, all right.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.676
The clown prince of crime.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.330
The Joker!

02:36.373 --> 02:39.985
Yes, and AC must stand
for Axis Chemicals.

02:40.029 --> 02:43.206
So it was that dirty clown
who stole Starfire's money.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.295
We must get it back from him.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.688
How's we gonna do that?

02:46.731 --> 02:49.430
The Joker be the greatest
scam artist of all times.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.388
Which is why
we're going to become

02:51.432 --> 02:52.694
even greater scam artists,

02:52.737 --> 02:55.044
so we can beat him
at his own game.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.396
But, friends,
I do not know the first thing

02:59.440 --> 03:01.442
about becoming
the artist of the scams.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.052
That's okay. We'll teach you.

03:03.095 --> 03:05.402
Yeah, we knows how to act
all shady and whatnots.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.709
Now, let's hit up Axis Chemicals

03:07.752 --> 03:10.102
and pay the Joker
a little visit.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.452
To the T-car!

03:11.495 --> 03:12.888
No, no.

03:12.931 --> 03:15.064
Scam artists use only

03:15.107 --> 03:16.413
a cheap convertible.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.124
Whoa. Check this place out.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.430
It's built like a fortress,

03:33.474 --> 03:36.825
and it appears the gate
requires the password.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.305
Not a problem.

03:38.348 --> 03:41.308
We can get that password
by using a phishing scam.

03:41.351 --> 03:44.136
Joy! How I love the fishing.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.529
No, mama.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.923
This scam ain't got
nothing to do with no fishes.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.447
It's a trick scam artists use

03:50.491 --> 03:51.796
to obtain sensitive information,

03:51.840 --> 03:54.843
by disguising themselves
as a trustworthy entity.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.342
Which is why's
we's gonna get that password

03:56.366 --> 03:57.759
by impersonating the Joker.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.283
And wait till
they get a load of me.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.851
Nice Nicholson, yo.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.245
<i>Security. What do you want?</i>

04:05.288 --> 04:07.290
My face on the $1 bill.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.641
Yo, yo, let me try
my Heath Ledger.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.513
Who is this?

04:12.556 --> 04:14.166
<i>Who am I?</i>

04:14.210 --> 04:15.994
<i>I'm an agent of chaos.</i>

04:16.038 --> 04:17.387
<i>Whoa. It's you, Joker.</i>

04:17.431 --> 04:19.433
<i>I'm so sorry I questioned you.</i>

04:19.476 --> 04:20.825
Relax.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.610
<i>Why so serious?</i>

04:22.653 --> 04:25.395
<i>Well, I just don't want you
to fire me.</i>

04:25.439 --> 04:27.832
Oh, my, I'm not gonna fire ya.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.443
I'm just gonna hurt ya.

04:29.486 --> 04:33.229
Really, really bad.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.491
<i>Wait a second.</i>

04:34.535 --> 04:36.188
<i>This isn't the Joker.</i>

04:36.232 --> 04:38.278
What do you think
you're doing, bro?

04:38.321 --> 04:40.018
Duh, Jared Leto.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.498
Jared Leto?

04:41.542 --> 04:43.259
You can't just put on some
tattoos and some fake teeth

04:43.283 --> 04:44.956
and make me think that you
some kind of crazy person.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.329
The no one is buying it.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.200
Your impression
is horrible, Robin.

04:48.244 --> 04:49.724
<i>I'm sending down some men.</i>

04:49.767 --> 04:51.682
Great. Now I's got
to convince these fools

04:51.726 --> 04:54.076
I's the Joker by doing
my best Mark Hamill.

04:54.119 --> 04:57.384
Listen, you numbskull.
This is the Joker.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.081
And if you don't give me
the password

04:59.124 --> 05:00.517
to this gate right now,

05:00.561 --> 05:03.607
I'm going to hunt you down
and feed you to my hyenas!

05:03.651 --> 05:05.130
Understood, sir.

05:05.174 --> 05:08.656
<i>The password is
jinglebellsbatmansmells1939.</i>

05:08.699 --> 05:09.918
It worked!

05:09.961 --> 05:11.702
See, mama, easy peasy.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.493
Ah! Oh, mans, more security!

05:19.536 --> 05:21.669
I know how we can get
past those guards.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.149
We can use the old
pig in a poke scam.

05:24.193 --> 05:26.456
The scam involves the poking?

05:29.372 --> 05:31.548
No, Star. It involves cats.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.463
The kitties!

05:33.507 --> 05:35.160
I knew you'd be excited.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.597
Now watch and learn.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.559
Salutation, gentlemen.

05:42.603 --> 05:43.928
Would either of you
care for a Coney,

05:43.952 --> 05:46.389
a Red Hot, a Bow Wow,
if you will?

05:46.433 --> 05:49.827
I'm offering you a link,
a wienerwurst,
a frank-n-furter.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.655
Look, you want a hot dog or not?

05:52.830 --> 05:53.788
Splendid.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.572
Then I shall bag some up for you

05:55.616 --> 05:57.637
faster than you can say,
"Herbert Hoover
was a charlatan."

05:57.661 --> 05:58.923
Here you are, my good men.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.930
Nice work, friend Raven.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.018
Now, let's get a move on.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.542
It should be
clear sailing from here.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.111
You were saying, dude?

06:13.155 --> 06:16.506
How are we going to get past
all of these henchmen?

06:16.550 --> 06:18.595
By using
the biggest scam of all,

06:18.639 --> 06:20.858
a financial planning seminar.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.644
Hey there, folks.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.820
Are you tired of working
the same old job?

06:25.863 --> 06:28.039
Do you wish you could be
your own boss?

06:28.083 --> 06:29.693
Well, guess what? You can.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.830
Hi. My name is Robin

06:35.873 --> 06:38.615
and I went from working
in the circus to being

06:38.659 --> 06:40.617
the rich, super hunk
you see before you.

06:42.358 --> 06:43.664
How did I do it, you ask?

06:43.707 --> 06:45.274
Well, it didn't
happen overnight.

06:45.317 --> 06:48.538
It took me years to develop
my specialized program

06:48.582 --> 06:50.453
that can help you
achieve your dreams

06:50.497 --> 06:51.628
of financial success.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.369
Don't believe me?

06:53.413 --> 06:57.504
Here's what some of my
celebrity clients had to say.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.593
<i>When it comes
to financial advice,</i>

06:59.636 --> 07:02.160
<i>Robin is a Superman.</i>

07:02.204 --> 07:03.423
<i>His program works.</i>

07:03.466 --> 07:04.728
<i>I'm Batman.</i>

07:04.772 --> 07:06.904
<i>Robin is truly
a financial wonder.</i>

07:06.948 --> 07:10.125
<i>Plus, he's so dreamy
and super cool.</i>

07:10.168 --> 07:11.735
So what are you waiting for?

07:11.779 --> 07:13.650
Take control of your future

07:13.694 --> 07:15.478
and sign up
for my program today.

07:15.522 --> 07:18.089
But I'll warn you.
Space is limited.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.135
Limited? Get out of my way.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.446
Hello, Joker.

07:26.489 --> 07:29.492
Robin, so good
to see you, my boy.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.450
It is?

07:30.493 --> 07:31.538
Of course!

07:31.581 --> 07:32.582
If you're here,

07:32.626 --> 07:34.715
my old pal Batman
must be close by.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.457
Where is that
crazy old bat brain?

07:37.500 --> 07:38.782
This has nothing
to do with Batman.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.504
I'm here on official
Teen Titans business.

07:41.548 --> 07:42.940
You must be joking.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.682
Do you have any idea
how busy I am?

07:45.726 --> 07:48.163
Listen, we know
you scammed Starfire

07:48.206 --> 07:50.687
by promising her that
you'd open a store together.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.602
Guilty as charged.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.648
So, give me back my money

07:54.691 --> 07:56.388
and we shall
get out of your hair.

07:56.432 --> 07:57.912
I'm afraid I can't do that.

07:57.955 --> 08:00.436
I already spent that money
on this facility.

08:01.568 --> 08:02.960
Why would you buy this dump?

08:03.004 --> 08:05.006
Well, I hate to ruin
a good punch line,

08:05.049 --> 08:07.835
but I'm using this place
to fill a giant whoopee cushion

08:07.878 --> 08:09.924
full of my patented Joker toxin,

08:09.967 --> 08:13.144
and when it goes off,
it will be quite the gas.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.365
We need to scam the Joker

08:16.408 --> 08:17.714
out of succeeding with his plan.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.716
Titans, go!

08:19.760 --> 08:21.631
I see terrible things
in your future

08:21.675 --> 08:23.328
if you don't stop
your evil ways.

08:24.373 --> 08:25.722
Nice try.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.352
Hey, brah, I think
you dropped your wallet.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.334
No, it's right here.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.599
Uncle, it's me.
Your long lost nephew.

08:32.642 --> 08:33.750
Please don't destroy the world.

08:33.774 --> 08:36.646
Okay. I won't.
Now put her there.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.435
No one can out-scam the Joker.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.872
Then we've got no choice.

08:44.915 --> 08:46.526
Titans, retreat!

08:49.616 --> 08:52.140
The ow. Oh, the ow!

08:52.183 --> 08:56.057
My body is riddled with
the aches and the pains.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.799
Nice going, Joker.
This is all your fault.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.757
My fault?
It was clearly an accident.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.716
Yes, an accident caused

09:02.759 --> 09:04.674
by the terrible upkeep
of this facility.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.720
Just look at this place, man.

09:06.763 --> 09:09.853
Dim lights, wet floors,
rusted guard rails.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.594
This plant is a liability.

09:11.638 --> 09:12.856
Sorry, I just bought it.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.771
I haven't had time
to bring it up to code.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.600
Well, it is too late
for the apologies.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.733
You shall be hearing
from my lawyer.

09:19.776 --> 09:20.864
Your lawyer?

09:20.908 --> 09:22.431
I can't deal with
a lawsuit right now.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.999
And it's going to mess up
all of my evil schemes.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.174
Please reconsider.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.002
I'll do anything
to make this up to you.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.482
- The anything?
- Yes, I swear.

09:30.526 --> 09:33.616
Very well, I would like
all of my money back.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.662
Here, take it.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.968
And for my pain
and the suffering,

09:38.012 --> 09:40.188
I would like
the deed to this facility.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.756
Forget it, I'm not going
to just hand this place over.

09:42.799 --> 09:43.974
Very well.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.933
Robin, what is the number
for our lawyer?

09:45.976 --> 09:47.325
Wait, wait.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.197
You drive such a hard bargain.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.372
Here.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.243
Now, we're all good, right?

09:52.287 --> 09:53.810
Not the quite.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.813
Tell your henchmen that
they now work for the me.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.249
My men? What's next?

09:58.293 --> 09:59.642
The clothes off my back?

09:59.686 --> 10:01.862
Yes, I shall be taking
those as well.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.429
There. Happy?

10:04.473 --> 10:07.737
Indeed!

10:08.825 --> 10:10.305
Hold the bat phone.

10:10.348 --> 10:13.395
So you were just faking
your injuries the whole time?

10:13.438 --> 10:14.831
That is correct.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.965
I can't believe I got scammed.

10:22.665 --> 10:23.971
Hey, kids.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.688
We're the Teen Titans
with an important message.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.409
We've all had a lot of fun today

10:27.452 --> 10:28.758
pulling off scams.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.847
But in reality,
scams cost consumers

10:30.891 --> 10:31.979
and businesses like this

10:32.022 --> 10:33.763
billions of dollars each year.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.723
Therefore,
if you encounter a scam,

10:36.766 --> 10:38.768
please tell a parent
or guardian.

10:38.812 --> 10:41.379
You don't wants
to get fooled, yo.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.990
Stay vigilant, kids.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.513
Now get to work,

10:44.556 --> 10:46.558
oh, gallant prince of mine.
