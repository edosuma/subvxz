00:40.708 --> 00:42.250
What fucking song

00:42.292 --> 00:44.252
am I even singing? I don't know, man.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.254
I don't know, you're... Whoo!

00:46.296 --> 00:48.674
fucked up but, man, you have cool hair!

00:46.296 --> 00:48.674
I've just got to say it.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.259
I do have cool hair but it actually does get

00:48.716 --> 00:51.259
into my eyes sometimes.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.262
(Louder) What the fuck is

00:51.301 --> 00:54.262
with those shoes?

Are you kidding me? Ricky:

00:54.304 --> 00:56.264
I know!

00:56.306 --> 00:59.018
Those are the shoes that fucking Kiss

would wear

00:59.059 --> 01:00.435
if Kiss...

01:00.477 --> 01:02.062
were Dutch!

See, boys? I fucking told you these are

01:02.103 --> 01:05.065
rock star shoes!

01:05.106 --> 01:06.525
They fucking suck, man.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.068
This fucking boat is amazing!

01:08.109 --> 01:09.695
It's fucking bad-ass!

01:09.737 --> 01:11.697
Oh, my fuck, is there any more pizza?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.949
Uh, you know, there is probably

01:11.739 --> 01:13.949
some food on here,

01:13.991 --> 01:15.701
but before I offer you some food,

01:15.743 --> 01:18.286
might I interest you in a tinxture?

01:15.743 --> 01:18.286
Bubbles: A what?

01:18.328 --> 01:21.081
A tinxture. Fuck is a... drink...?

01:21.122 --> 01:22.708
A what? A tinxter?

01:22.750 --> 01:24.919
Tinxture. Dude, are you guys

01:22.750 --> 01:24.919
aware of the fact

01:24.960 --> 01:27.546
that they've totally re-invented weed?

01:27.588 --> 01:29.381
A bit but...

01:29.423 --> 01:33.844
Dude, a weed tinxture can be indica, sativa,

01:29.423 --> 01:33.844
topically applied.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.679
You can put it in an eye-dropper,

01:35.721 --> 01:37.514
put it under your tongue for sleep.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.934
They got weed vapes, weed chocolates,

01:39.975 --> 01:42.937
weed muffins, weed rice krispies,

01:42.978 --> 01:45.522
weed ketchup, weed mayo,

01:42.978 --> 01:45.522
weed mustard.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.733
Can I interest you in a weed sandwich?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.317
Have you ever met my chicks?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.945
Hey. Julian:

01:49.359 --> 01:50.945
Hey girls.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.780
Hey, ladies. Rock star ladies!

01:52.821 --> 01:55.115
Come on in. What the fuck are you

01:52.821 --> 01:55.115
even doing here?

01:55.156 --> 01:58.535
I don't know. I was in California,

01:55.156 --> 01:58.535
like, two nights ago

01:58.577 --> 02:01.538
and I woke up and we're in fucking Amsterdam.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.206
(Chuckling) That's what

02:01.580 --> 02:03.206
rock stars do.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.208
They get fucked up, wake up around

02:03.248 --> 02:05.208
the world.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.086
That's true.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.837
Well, do you mind if I roll a hash joint

02:07.127 --> 02:08.837
on your boat?

02:08.879 --> 02:11.006
I promise I won't burn it down or

02:08.879 --> 02:11.006
anything.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.759
Well, you know, Amsterdam, you're

02:11.048 --> 02:13.759
familiar with the scene here, right?

02:13.801 --> 02:17.137
This is the fucking town where you can

02:13.801 --> 02:17.137
smoke dope

02:17.178 --> 02:19.974
on a rope, with the pope,

02:20.015 --> 02:22.350
and they won't even nope.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.979
Man: Hey, you there!

02:22.392 --> 02:24.979
Shhii...

02:25.020 --> 02:27.564
(Speaking in Dutch)

02:27.606 --> 02:29.483
Sebastian: What the fuck

02:27.606 --> 02:29.483
does that even mean?

02:29.524 --> 02:31.318
Policeman: Get off of this boat!

02:31.359 --> 02:32.569
This is what this means.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.155
Get the fuck off my boat!

02:35.196 --> 02:36.991
Is this your boat?

02:37.032 --> 02:38.993
Well, dude... I thought it was

02:37.032 --> 02:38.993
like the bikes.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.995
The hotel's got the bikes in front of it

02:41.036 --> 02:42.788
and the fucking boat is in front of the bikes.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.623
I thought you could just borrow the boat.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.374
I was just going to borrow it,

02:46.416 --> 02:49.377
go back to California and I'd then bring it

02:46.416 --> 02:49.377
right back!

02:49.419 --> 02:52.589
I do like hanging out with rock stars

02:49.419 --> 02:52.589
whenever I get the chance

02:52.631 --> 02:55.592
but it's probably not the best idea when

02:52.631 --> 02:55.592
you're on your way to,

02:55.634 --> 02:57.594
like, a huge event like a CSN concert,

02:57.636 --> 02:59.178
because we could have got arrested.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.180
Most people that are standing on a stolen boat,

03:01.222 --> 03:04.601
they don't go on the offence against the police.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.394
That's 'cause the tinctures.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.605
Policeman: Do I have to drag you

03:06.436 --> 03:08.605
off of this boat?

03:08.647 --> 03:10.816
Do I have to drag you off of this boat

03:10.858 --> 03:12.609
so I got to drag you back on the boat

03:12.651 --> 03:15.403
so you can drag me off the fucking boat?

03:15.445 --> 03:17.614
Okay, guys, off this boat! Come on!

03:17.656 --> 03:19.783
Look, officer, sorry. We didn't know it

03:17.656 --> 03:19.783
wasn't his boat.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.200
We can't get arrested!

03:21.242 --> 03:22.828
Where are you going? Fuck me.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.621
Why? Less than 5 grams,

03:22.870 --> 03:24.621
we're cool, right?

03:24.663 --> 03:26.205
(Breaking glass) Where are you

03:24.663 --> 03:26.205
fucking guys going?

03:26.247 --> 03:27.833
Nice going, Rick! Why? Why...

03:27.875 --> 03:29.459
Julian: Just get off

03:27.875 --> 03:29.459
the fucking boat.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.586
Why are you smashing shit?

03:32.671 --> 03:34.255
Why do you smash?

03:34.297 --> 03:36.133
(Under breath) My fuck!

03:36.175 --> 03:38.052
He's fucking crazy, man. He's hardcore! (Chuckling)

03:38.093 --> 03:40.054
Let's go, boys.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.056
All right, let's go somewhere so I can

03:40.095 --> 03:42.056
finish rolling this joint.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.891
Ricky, we're not rolling a joint!

03:43.932 --> 03:46.643
We are going to fucking eat, right

03:43.932 --> 03:46.643
now! I'm in charge.

03:46.685 --> 03:47.895
Fine!

03:47.936 --> 03:49.771
(Clogs clopping)

03:49.813 --> 03:51.857
Bubs, you've got to fucking pick a place, man.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.651
What about this place? It's a sit-down

03:51.899 --> 03:54.651
fucking restaurant, Ricky.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.444
I've got 6 euros. I keep telling you that.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.155

03:56.486 --> 03:58.155

03:58.197 --> 03:59.907
Whatever the hell it's called.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.742
There you go, 4.95 combo.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.742
It's a noodle place.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.660
It's full of fucking MSG. I'll

04:01.783 --> 04:03.660
be hungry in an hour.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.871
Okay, let's get some ice cream,

04:03.702 --> 04:05.871
or some chips,

04:05.913 --> 04:07.664
or just something that'll fucking fill

04:05.913 --> 04:07.664
us up a little bit.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.666
I'm dying here! Frites!

04:09.708 --> 04:11.459
Frites. French fry shop.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.294
This is it. Right on,

04:11.501 --> 04:13.294
there you go.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.713
This is the place I've been waiting for.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.381
We're going to eat, and then what?

04:16.423 --> 04:18.466
We're going to the Crosby, Stills

04:16.423 --> 04:18.466
and Nash concert.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.468
I might just hang out at one of the smoke

04:18.508 --> 04:20.468
shops, all right?

04:20.510 --> 04:22.470
Smoke some hash, you guys can meet me

04:20.510 --> 04:22.470
afterwards.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.098
No but, you're coming to the concert with us.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.724
Concert. You're coming.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.350
Get a big order too, if you can,

04:27.392 --> 04:28.894
because there's people that are hungry.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.479
Bubbles: I'm getting

04:28.936 --> 04:31.479
what I want! Hi, there!

04:31.521 --> 04:34.108
Swearnet's really impressed with the shit

04:31.521 --> 04:34.108
you've been doing.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.484
Oh, right on. Especially that stunt

04:34.149 --> 04:36.484
with the Queen's underwear.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.361
I kind of fucked that up a little bit.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.280
Do you want to make some big money?

04:38.403 --> 04:40.280
Yes.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.907
Here's a special mission for you.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.909
Don't say nothing to the boys.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.119
Thanks, man!

04:47.162 --> 04:50.832
(Mixed chatter)

04:53.168 --> 04:55.921
Do you like garlic sauce? No, I fucking hate

04:53.168 --> 04:55.921
garlic sauce.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.298
Garlic sauce, please! Are you kidding me?

04:58.339 --> 05:00.217
Put the garlic! Drive the garlic to her!

05:00.259 --> 05:02.844
Let's do it. Let's go to the concert, boys.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.844
I'm pumped.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.680
What do you mean? I thought you said

05:02.886 --> 05:05.680
you didn't want to go.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.682
Well.. just... I can probably smoke there

05:07.724 --> 05:09.476
and, band's pretty good, aren't they?

05:09.517 --> 05:11.728
They're really fucking good, Ricky.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.730
They're really good but why, all of a sudden,

05:11.770 --> 05:13.730
do you want to go now?

05:13.772 --> 05:15.315
I went out there and then...

05:15.356 --> 05:16.733
Just on half, please.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.652
...weather and different things like that.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.654
No, that's perfect, yep. Load 'em

05:18.693 --> 05:20.654
right up, yes.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.949
Just get... Just ketchup's fine.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.949
No. Ketchup and mayo.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.534
Are you fucking... You know I don't like

05:23.991 --> 05:26.534
fucking mayonnaise.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.328
Here you go.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.330
Awesome! Thank you! Look at that!

05:30.371 --> 05:32.332
That looks amazing!

05:32.373 --> 05:33.750
(Chuckles) That's what...

05:33.792 --> 05:35.376
Oh, but, careful, careful careful!

05:35.418 --> 05:36.962
You almost dropped one there, Bubs.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.962
That one there,

05:37.004 --> 05:38.379
it almost fell right out.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.215
So did that one. This is... Boys!

05:40.257 --> 05:41.842
Those ones don't have any sauce on.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.842
This is why I...

05:41.883 --> 05:43.093
Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles! Jesus!

05:43.135 --> 05:44.343
Ricky! What are you doing?

05:44.385 --> 05:45.762
Almost fell right on the ground, there!

05:45.804 --> 05:47.388
I wasn't dropping it!

05:47.430 --> 05:49.183
I had a perfect hold of it!

05:49.224 --> 05:50.976
Holy fuck, these are good.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.727
(Muttering with a full mouth)

05:52.769 --> 05:54.353
Oh, God.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.773
So you guys just spend all your money

05:54.395 --> 05:56.773
on liquor and dope

05:56.815 --> 05:58.399
and then you eat my food!

05:58.441 --> 06:00.027
It was going to get wasted and I saved it.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.653
So you should be thanking me.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.571
These are the best fucking fries I ever

06:01.695 --> 06:03.571
had in my life.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.199
Those are pretty good.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.825
Boys, I saved my money just so that I could eat

06:06.867 --> 06:08.660
and now you guys are eating all my...

06:08.702 --> 06:10.787
Well, you did smoke a big part of that

06:08.702 --> 06:10.787
joint that I rolled.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.789
I paid for a big part of that joint!

06:12.831 --> 06:14.373
I paid for some of that.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.375
Look who's sharing his drink with ya, me.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.004
I paid fucking two euros and had one drink!

06:19.046 --> 06:21.006
You had a big drink, though.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.633
(Sighing) Do you think I could

06:21.048 --> 06:23.633
have a fucking bite now?

06:23.675 --> 06:25.635
Is that cool? One more bite,

06:23.675 --> 06:25.635
one more bite.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.512
Ricky: You should eat it

06:25.677 --> 06:27.512
before it gets cold.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.388
Well... if he's getting two bites, I'm getting

06:27.554 --> 06:29.388
two bites.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.807
Boys!

06:30.849 --> 06:33.018
I haven't even tasted it yet!

06:33.060 --> 06:34.644
Here you go, buddy.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.272
Here, man. Just eat it.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.272
There you go.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.815
All right, let's go.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.067
Don't let that fall there.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.110
You guys are fucking assholes!

06:42.152 --> 06:46.531
You've got to start eating them, Bubs...

06:42.152 --> 06:46.531
(Indistinct)

06:46.573 --> 06:48.616
Are you done? Can I get you

06:46.573 --> 06:48.616
anything else?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.409
(Mouth full) Well, if you're offering more!

06:48.658 --> 06:50.409
Just need a napkin.

06:50.451 --> 06:53.038
No, I'm not! I was being sarc...

06:53.080 --> 06:54.998
(Patting) I love you, buddy.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.876
Let's go to the show.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.627
Thanks for the food, man. You saved us.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.255
You're a good friend. (Mouth full)

06:59.669 --> 07:01.255
Thanks, Bubs.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.714
We're on vacation. Friends share.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.341
There's what I'm left with, everybody.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.967
Sharing my hash... There's what

07:04.383 --> 07:05.967
I'm left with.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.178
He shared his drink. A fucking little bit

07:06.009 --> 07:08.178
of a hot dog,

07:08.220 --> 07:09.846
and some picked-over fries

07:09.888 --> 07:12.266
because I hang out with two fucking vultures!

07:12.307 --> 07:14.517
All I wanted was a couple things to eat

07:12.307 --> 07:14.517
before going to see

07:14.559 --> 07:16.270
one of the greatest bands in the world.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.063
I don't think that's too much to ask!

07:18.105 --> 07:19.856
Now I'm all jinkity-janked!

07:19.898 --> 07:22.859
I'm going to have to turn my frown upside down!

07:22.901 --> 07:24.069
(Puffing)

07:26.113 --> 07:27.948
Bubbles: This is awesome!

07:27.989 --> 07:30.075
Where do you want to go, Bubs? You guys

07:27.989 --> 07:30.075
want to get a seat or...?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.659
We don't have seats but we have these.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.659
We can go wherever we want.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.662
Why don't we see if we can go backstage?

07:34.704 --> 07:36.664
Let's see powerful these things are.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.875
We might be able to.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.086
Julian: Bubs, people are laughing

07:38.917 --> 07:41.086
at our clogs, man.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.462
Still 25 bucks.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.467
We're just... we're with the band.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.844
With the band! (Chuckles)

07:51.721 --> 07:54.308
These passes we got, these things are unbelievable!

07:54.349 --> 07:57.311
Seems like you can just go wherever you want

07:54.349 --> 07:57.311
with these things.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.687
Maybe go check where the band's hanging out!

07:59.729 --> 08:01.481
(Wheezing chuckle)

08:01.522 --> 08:03.691
Unbelievable!

08:03.733 --> 08:06.111
So what do you think? You're going to try

08:03.733 --> 08:06.111
to do this or what?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.322
I don't know. I'm pretty nervous,

08:06.153 --> 08:08.322
but I mean, we're here,

08:08.363 --> 08:10.324
should we just go try to meet them?

08:08.363 --> 08:10.324
Let's do it, man.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.699
Let's just try. Fuck it.

08:11.741 --> 08:12.951
Keep drinking some water.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.411
I need to get some rum back here.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.121
Why are you drinking so much water, Ricky?

08:16.163 --> 08:17.497
(Exhaling) Thirsty.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.750
Bubbles is all excited about meeting the band.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.752
I don't give a fuck we're meeting Cosby,

08:20.792 --> 08:22.752
Bill & Stash.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.754
I've got my own little secret mission to deal with,

08:24.796 --> 08:26.714
and this is going to be fucking fun.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.218
(Crushing plastic)

08:31.970 --> 08:33.554
Bubbles: (Whispering) Listen!

08:33.596 --> 08:35.723
(Guitar strumming)

08:35.765 --> 08:37.725
That's them.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.894
Pumped? Do not fuck this up!

08:40.979 --> 08:42.939
Hang back!

08:42.981 --> 08:46.360
When I get overly excited, my bird starts doing that

08:42.981 --> 08:46.360
uncontrollably.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.736
This is one of the biggest moments of my life.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.156
I'm just hoping it doesn't get out of hand.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.573
(Whispering) Look, boys.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.825
(Guitar music)

08:53.867 --> 08:55.076
Ricky: So cool.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.745
(Guitar music)

08:57.787 --> 08:59.164
(Inaudible)

08:59.206 --> 09:00.581
(Whispering) Go in, let's go.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.833
Ricky: That's cool.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.833
They get off stage

09:01.875 --> 09:03.084
and still want to play?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.669
Go in. Don't be nervous.

09:06.421 --> 09:09.174
(Knocking with clogs)

09:09.216 --> 09:10.591
Boys!

09:10.633 --> 09:12.593
Stills: Boy, who's that

09:10.633 --> 09:12.593
walking so loud?

09:12.635 --> 09:14.221
(Guitar strumming)

09:14.262 --> 09:16.390
Bubbles: (Nervously) Hey there...!

09:16.431 --> 09:17.807
Nash: What can we do

09:16.431 --> 09:17.807
for you guys?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.059
Ricky: Hey, how's it going?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.477
Julian: Hey, guys.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.312
Sorry, we were told we could come back.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.147
I don't know if that's all

09:22.354 --> 09:24.147
right or not.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.566
Swearnet gave us passes and we just came back

09:24.189 --> 09:26.566
to meet you.

09:26.607 --> 09:29.194
Any of our roadies out there? They let you in?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.571
Nobody out there. So we just came, hi!

09:29.236 --> 09:31.571
Hey!

09:31.612 --> 09:33.573
My name's Bubbles. I'm Graham.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.409
Bubbles? I know who you are.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.409
Nice to meet you.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.035
Ah, you must be Bubbles.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.035
I am Bubbles.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.953
Yes, you are. I'm Ricky.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.580
Ricky, how are you doing? Ricky:

09:38.995 --> 09:40.580
Good. Nice to meet you.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.207
I'm Julian. Hey. Good to meet you.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.207
Hi there!

09:42.249 --> 09:44.209
How you doing? You guys got

09:42.249 --> 09:44.209
any rum in here?

09:44.251 --> 09:46.294
Didn't you used to play for (indistinct)?

09:44.251 --> 09:46.294
You guys are awesome.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.796
Ah, I don't think so. Hey, Rick, can you

09:46.336 --> 09:48.796
get some rum for us?

09:48.838 --> 09:51.216
Would you get some... Ask Coach for rum.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.218
Okay. Ricky:

09:51.258 --> 09:53.218
Awesome.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.429
It's good. Yeah, yeah, it's good.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.431
Actually, is there a bathroom out here

09:55.470 --> 09:57.431
I could use for a bit?

09:57.472 --> 09:58.973
There's one right there. Okay?

09:59.015 --> 10:00.392
Well, I...

10:00.434 --> 10:02.685
I get a little nervous.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.272
I'd rather have peace and quiet, if that's...

10:02.727 --> 10:05.272
Ricky, just use the man's...

10:05.313 --> 10:07.023
Is there one out this way or...?

10:07.065 --> 10:09.025
Well, there's one, it's right down

10:07.065 --> 10:09.025
the hall, though.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.777
Okay. It's a ways away.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.777
There's one right there.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.612
Can I borrow that... can I borrow your phone?

10:12.653 --> 10:14.448
What? I've just got to borrow

10:12.653 --> 10:14.448
your phone for a sec.

10:14.489 --> 10:17.242
Kind of freaking out here because, meeting

10:14.489 --> 10:17.242
you guys,

10:17.284 --> 10:19.827
and I know this is a bit of an

10:17.284 --> 10:19.827
odd request but,

10:19.869 --> 10:21.829
if I played you a bit of a song that I do...

10:21.871 --> 10:24.040
How does the camera work? Just...

10:24.082 --> 10:25.750
What do you mean how's the camera work?

10:25.792 --> 10:27.461
How do you take a picture, you just...?

10:27.502 --> 10:29.045
Press the fucking button. It's right there.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.045
Okay.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.297
Nash: I like that.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.548
Well, that's always good.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.049
Okay, You want to use my guitar?

10:33.091 --> 10:34.634
Yeah, could I? Sure.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.595
Sure. Try to be quick, Bubs.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.597
You probably don't have a lot of time.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.597
Okay, Ricky...

10:38.638 --> 10:40.474
It's right down the hall to the

10:38.638 --> 10:40.474
right there, Ricky.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.100
Thanks, guys! Nash:

10:40.515 --> 10:42.100
You got it.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.851
Julian: Can I eat some

10:42.142 --> 10:43.851
of these cupcakes?

10:43.893 --> 10:45.270
Anything you want. Anything you want.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.896
You got anything you want there.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.398
So some words, maybe?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.024
Yeah, it's in... it's just two chords,

10:50.066 --> 10:52.277
G, A minor, for the chorus.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.280
And the chorus goes "Liquor and whores,

10:52.319 --> 10:55.280
liquor and whores,

10:55.322 --> 10:57.073
"Cigarettes and dope

10:57.115 --> 10:59.075
"and mustard and baloney, Liquor and whores."

10:59.117 --> 11:00.494
(Chuckling) Give us a clue here.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.078
So it goes like this.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.499
♪ Liquor and whores ♪

11:05.540 --> 11:08.084
♪ Liquor and whores ♪

11:20.347 --> 11:25.893

11:25.935 --> 11:28.687
♪ ... and baloney, liquor and whores ♪

11:28.729 --> 11:30.689
One more time.

Bubbles: Oh, my fuck, I just sang

11:59.177 --> 12:01.929
with Stills and Nash!

12:01.971 --> 12:03.931
(Chuckling)

12:03.973 --> 12:05.600
So maybe it's like "B",

12:05.642 --> 12:08.603
BSN, Bubbles, Stills & Nash.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.603
Bubbles, Stills & Nash?

12:08.645 --> 12:10.771
That's probably a bit much to ask.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.771
Why not?

12:10.813 --> 12:13.149
Hey! BSN! That's probably a bit much.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.151
I love the BS. That's great.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.362
That could be a TV network in Canada, BSN.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.364
(Chuckling) It could be.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.740
But wait a second. So you've already

12:19.406 --> 12:21.740
published this song?

12:21.782 --> 12:23.577
It's out on record somewhere?

12:23.618 --> 12:25.953
Well, not exactly. I mean, I think,

12:25.995 --> 12:28.747
if I worked at it, I could make it a

12:25.995 --> 12:28.747
pretty good song.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.542
No kidding. I think that could be a smash.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.377
Can you sing like that

12:32.419 --> 12:34.588
like in "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes", for instance?

12:34.629 --> 12:36.381
Wow, why don't you join in on that one?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.757
Oh, my God. If you guys play that, I might have

12:36.423 --> 12:38.757
a...

12:38.799 --> 12:40.385
I might faint! Really?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.178
I'd love to, yes, I always...

12:42.220 --> 12:48.393

13:31.018 --> 13:33.480
Is this guy with you all?

13:31.018 --> 13:33.480
Nash: Yeah he's...

13:33.521 --> 13:35.440
Well, I just caught him pissing in the

13:33.521 --> 13:35.440
dressing room...

13:35.482 --> 13:36.775
Julian: Are you fucking

13:35.482 --> 13:36.775
kidding me?

13:36.815 --> 13:38.401
Man: ...all over your clothes.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.401
What!

13:38.443 --> 13:39.818
Man: I want you all to get

13:38.443 --> 13:39.818
the fuck out of here now.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.070
Ricky! Ricky!

13:41.112 --> 13:42.322
Julian: Are you fucking

13:41.112 --> 13:42.322
kidding me.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.740
You guys need to leave now.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.991
Bubbles: Ricky! We just made

13:43.782 --> 13:44.991
500 bucks, boys!

13:45.032 --> 13:47.034
(Mixed shouting)

13:47.076 --> 13:49.454
I don't know if I can ever fucking forgive

13:47.076 --> 13:49.454
Ricky for this.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.247
I mean, I don't get to play with people

13:51.289 --> 13:54.041
like Stephen Stills and Graham Nash every fucking day,

13:54.083 --> 13:55.834
and Ricky goes and fucks it up

13:55.876 --> 13:57.462
and now I'll never know what could have been.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.047
I could have been in BSN. You don't know.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.467
Pissing in the dressing room?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.427
Out, let's go. Are you kidding me? What?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.471
Bubbles: Ricky!

14:06.513 --> 14:09.056
My God, sorry Ricky pissed on your stuff.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.056
He couldn't find the...

14:09.098 --> 14:10.849
He's kind of fucked in the head.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.849
(Sighing)

14:10.891 --> 14:12.268
We're sorry about this.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.479
Well, it's okay.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.691
I don't mind as long as it wasn't my

14:14.521 --> 14:17.691
dressing room.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.108
(Whimpering) Oh, might have been.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.694
We all have different ones, you know.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.153
Sorry... sir!

14:22.195 --> 14:23.404
Well, Bubbles, don't... don't cry!

14:23.446 --> 14:24.905
Security guard: Let's go now!

14:24.947 --> 14:26.907
Okay, sorry about that. I didn't know he was...

14:26.949 --> 14:28.702
Hey, don't be so mean!

14:28.743 --> 14:30.286
They're Canadians!

14:30.328 --> 14:32.246
They don't know any better!

14:32.288 --> 14:34.290
I don't know why those guys are so pissed off.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.290
I said I was sorry.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.292
I don't know what else I can do.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.712
Swearnet offered me 500 bucks to piss on all

14:36.334 --> 14:38.712
three of their clothes.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.214
I mean that's good easy money and here we are in Amsterdam

14:38.753 --> 14:41.214
with no money.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.717
And I almost pulled it off. I got Nills and Stash,

14:41.255 --> 14:43.717
just didn't get Cosby.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.343
And it's not my fucking fault I got caught.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.679
It was the fucking security dick's fault.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.723
I'm not mad at Rick for pissing on the band's clothes.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.726
I'm just pissed off that he did it before fucking

14:49.764 --> 14:52.726
Bubbles got the chance

14:52.767 --> 14:54.519
to sing with all three band members.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.731
He basically fucked up two tasks with one fuck-up.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.733
What an idiot!

14:59.774 --> 15:02.109
Bubbles: I can't fucking

14:59.774 --> 15:02.109
believe you, Ricky!

15:02.151 --> 15:04.111
You know what? I'm pretty sure the

15:02.151 --> 15:04.111
old man taught me that,

15:04.153 --> 15:06.113
once you say sorry, it's forgotten about

15:04.153 --> 15:06.113
forever.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.199
It's not that easy! I think it's

15:06.155 --> 15:08.199
the rule...

15:08.241 --> 15:10.910
I don't think we're even going in the fucking

15:08.241 --> 15:10.910
right way to the bus.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.746
We're going the right way, Bubs.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.789
We look like we're getting into the dirty part of town.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.791
You sure you know where you're going?

15:14.831 --> 15:16.791
I know where I'm going.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.918
I tore off one of the tasks off the sheet his morning

15:18.959 --> 15:21.337
hoping we wouldn't have to do it,

15:21.379 --> 15:25.132
but now we have no choice, we've got to fucking do it.

15:21.379 --> 15:25.132
We've got to eat.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.342
Holy shit, boys.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.137
Wow. Holy sweet fuck!

15:30.179 --> 15:31.723
Bubbles: My God, look at her!

15:31.765 --> 15:33.140
Bubs, she's just... she winked at you.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.392
She's telling you to go up there, man.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.685
Ricky: She was pointing

15:34.434 --> 15:35.685
right at ya!

15:35.727 --> 15:37.103
Bubbles: She's not

15:35.727 --> 15:37.103
winking at me...

15:37.144 --> 15:38.521
Julian: She just winked

15:37.144 --> 15:38.521
right at you, man.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.356
She did not. Teasing me.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.442
Wow. That's what they do.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.442
That's how they lure you in.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.278
You know what, Bubs? If I had the money,

15:42.483 --> 15:45.278
I'd give it to you right now.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.154
Listen... If I had the money,

15:47.196 --> 15:49.156
I'd head right in, believe me.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.156
You'd head right in?

15:49.198 --> 15:51.951
(Chuckling) If I had the money.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.951
We don't have any.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.953
What if I was to tell you you could get it with her

15:51.992 --> 15:53.953
for free right now?

15:53.994 --> 15:55.413
Would you do it?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.415
How? Yeah, how?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.125
(Sighing)

15:59.166 --> 16:00.794
I ripped this off this morning

16:00.835 --> 16:02.796
because I didn't want to put any pressure on you

16:02.837 --> 16:04.756
but check that out. Give me

16:02.837 --> 16:04.756
that fucking thing...

16:04.798 --> 16:06.382
Julian: You don't have

16:04.798 --> 16:06.382
to do it, Bubs.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.175
(Reading) "Convince Bubbles"...

16:08.217 --> 16:10.929
You can get paid 100 bucks to do it!

16:08.217 --> 16:10.929
100 bucks.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.180
So this is all pre-paid?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.180
Pre-paid.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.391
You can go in there right now and get with her

16:13.222 --> 16:15.391
and we can make 100 bucks.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.184
We get to eat. Oh, no, I can't, boys.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.186
I can't just head in there. You don't have to do it.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.855
I would have to get, you know, psyched up.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.816
All right. You know, we are starving

16:20.897 --> 16:22.816
to death here, Bubs.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.442
And we don't have any money.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.442
100 bucks...

16:24.484 --> 16:25.819
We can get some more food and...

16:25.860 --> 16:27.528
It's 100 bucks, man. more hash...

16:27.570 --> 16:29.155
So you want me to go do some banging

16:27.570 --> 16:29.155
space cakes...

16:29.196 --> 16:30.573
so that you can eat? For 100 bucks.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.241
Well, do you want to eat? rolling papers...

16:32.283 --> 16:33.993
new pipe... Yes, I'm fucking

16:32.283 --> 16:33.993
starving to death.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.912
I would do it if I could, man.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.872
I'd do it too but I'm trying to get back

16:35.954 --> 16:37.872
with Lucy right now.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.874
(Growling) All right, let's

16:37.914 --> 16:39.874
just go, then.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.417
Forget about it. She said,

16:39.916 --> 16:41.417
no prostitutes.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.336
I knew you wouldn't do it.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.171
I'm a little bit nervous. I'm not in the right

16:43.377 --> 16:45.171
frame of mind.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.589
I would have to get psyched up.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.215
So what do I do? I just knock on the door?

16:48.257 --> 16:50.217
She's coming right now.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.217
(Chuckling)

16:50.259 --> 16:52.011
Good luck, buddy!

16:52.052 --> 16:53.262
Hi, gorgeous. Come in.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.389
Ricky: Wow. (Chuckling)

16:55.431 --> 16:57.224
Pretty tough job you've got there, Bubs!

16:57.266 --> 16:59.644
Julian: You got this, Bubs.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.644
Proud of you, man.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.646
Hi there! My name's Bubbles...

17:01.688 --> 17:04.732
I... don't really do this type of

17:01.688 --> 17:04.732
thing too often.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.652
(Mouthing silently)

17:07.694 --> 17:08.862
Woman: Come in.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.698
Oh, no, no, no.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.032
Only us, no cameras.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.241
Boys, don't leave me!

17:17.077 --> 17:18.663
Ricky: Fuck, this hash is nice.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.874
I love it over here! It's awesome!

17:20.915 --> 17:22.876
Fuck, he's putting in a pretty good

17:20.915 --> 17:22.876
shift in there!

17:22.917 --> 17:24.878
I kind of thought he'd only last

17:22.917 --> 17:24.878
a couple minutes.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.420
Yeah, I thought he would too.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.257
(Nervous chuckle)

17:30.299 --> 17:31.467
(Exhaling)

17:35.889 --> 17:37.473
Ricky: Hey, there he is!

17:37.515 --> 17:40.059
Nice chattin' with ya!

17:37.515 --> 17:40.059
Yeah, you too, thank you

17:40.100 --> 17:41.477
Thank you!

17:41.519 --> 17:42.896
How was it, Bubs?

17:42.937 --> 17:44.814
Oh, it was... You did it.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.900
It was pretty crazy! You did it?

17:46.941 --> 17:50.904
Going into a private room like that with a lady

17:46.941 --> 17:50.904
of the evening,

17:50.945 --> 17:54.073
it's a little more nerve-wracking than

17:50.945 --> 17:54.073
I thought it would be.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.909
I don't think it's really my cup of tea.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.077
I mean, I don't want the boys to know

17:58.118 --> 17:59.913
how nervous I was

17:59.954 --> 18:02.916
but they wouldn't let up with the greasy questions.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.292
All right. Let's go. (Indistinct)

18:05.334 --> 18:07.921
No, Ricky. I got her going.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.921
Okay, good.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.881
Don't worry, I got her going.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.925
You lasted a lot longer than I thought

18:09.923 --> 18:11.925
you would, man.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.927
(Chuckle) I thought you'd only be in

18:11.966 --> 18:13.927
there for, like, a minute.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.929
Yeah. Did you get

18:13.968 --> 18:15.929
a mouth hug?

18:15.970 --> 18:19.098
Err... Different things went on, Ricky.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.308
Different things? Different things.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.143
A bunch of different positions and stuff?

18:23.185 --> 18:25.730
Crazy stuff, crazy stuff went on in there.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.523
Well, let's go get some money,

18:27.565 --> 18:29.943
get some food, go back to that

18:27.565 --> 18:29.943
little hash bar,

18:29.984 --> 18:31.903
get some more of that sort of stuff,

18:31.945 --> 18:33.446
maybe get a drink for Julian.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.239
Bubbles: I might have

18:33.487 --> 18:35.239
to just go to bed.

18:37.575 --> 18:41.120
Bubbles: I can't believe you pissed

18:37.575 --> 18:41.120
on Graham Nash's toothbrush!

18:41.161 --> 18:43.289
He probably used the fucking thing by now!

18:43.330 --> 18:45.124
Ricky: Well, after the way they threw

18:43.330 --> 18:45.124
us out I don't give a fuck.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.167
Fuck 'em! He shouldn't have left it by his pants!

18:47.209 --> 18:49.754
Julian: I can't wait to get paid,

18:47.209 --> 18:49.754
pack my bag and go the fuck home!

18:49.796 --> 18:51.547
Bubbles: No kidding.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.547
Hello, boys.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.549
Oh, fuck, great! How was your evening?

18:53.591 --> 18:55.384
It was fine. It was fine.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.553
Probably would have been better if you didn't

18:55.426 --> 18:57.553
get me to piss

18:57.595 --> 19:00.139
on fucking Crosby, Stills and Nash's clothing

18:57.595 --> 19:00.139
for fucking money,

19:00.180 --> 19:03.350
which fucked him up singing with them,

19:00.180 --> 19:03.350
which he almost pulled together.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.562
Not my decision. It came from head

19:03.392 --> 19:06.562
office of Swearnet.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.773
Okay. Give us our money.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.984
Give us the money for the clogs, first of all.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.984
Yep.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.986
We wore those all fucking day.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.988
My back's killing me. My feet are fucked.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.990
It specifically said

19:17.031 --> 19:18.992
"traditional wooden clogs"

19:19.033 --> 19:20.994
not the fruity touristy ones.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.787
Oh, my fuck, are you kidding me?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.789
Julian: Are you fucking kidding me?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.789
Here we go again.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.582
That's the technicality. Everything's a technicality,

19:26.624 --> 19:28.208
for fuck's sakes!

19:28.250 --> 19:29.627
All right, well that's it! We've got nothing.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.045
No, no, no, no, we're going to get paid.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.922
He hooked up with that hooker.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.922
Let's go!

19:32.964 --> 19:34.799
We did pull that off. So let's go with

19:32.964 --> 19:34.799
the money.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.801
Oh, really? Is that what he told you?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.801
Yeah.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.803
Let's just... go home, boys.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.803
What?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.220
You said it was crazy.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.015
Yeah, I spoke to the madam.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.808
As soon as the hooker started grinding him,

19:43.850 --> 19:45.810
game over! Julian:

19:43.850 --> 19:45.810
What?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.812
Before he could even get his rig out.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.063
Julian: Bubs, why didn't you just...

19:49.105 --> 19:50.815
You could have told us that, man!

19:50.857 --> 19:52.066
Mmm, I didn't know.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.609
Well, better luck next time.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.153
I'll see you on the next one.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.779
There's never going to be a

19:55.194 --> 19:56.779
fucking next one.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.197
I guarantee you that. Not a fucking chance.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.033
Oh, yeah, there is. No, there isn't.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.617
Read your contract.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.452
What? What?

20:01.659 --> 20:03.452
What?

20:03.494 --> 20:05.830
He signed it. There's more of these?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.456
There's more of these to come.
