00:06.959 --> 00:09.750
( upbeat alternative rock

00:13.750 --> 00:16.417
Naomi's okay with it?
Yes.

00:16.458 --> 00:17.834
With you and me,
she's okay with it?

00:17.875 --> 00:20.041
Yes.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.625
You told her
we were sleeping together,

00:21.667 --> 00:23.041
and she's fine with that?

00:23.083 --> 00:25.834
Sam.
No, I'm just saying.

00:25.875 --> 00:27.250
Her ex-husband
and best friend

00:27.291 --> 00:29.959
doing all kinds of pervy,
hot, nasty, sexy...

00:30.000 --> 00:31.041
Okay,
she was surprised, yes,

00:31.083 --> 00:32.458
but, you know,
we drank some wine.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.834
We did what we do,
and in the end, she was fine.

00:34.875 --> 00:36.875
I mean, it's okay.
She's okay.

00:36.917 --> 00:38.542
If you say so.

00:38.583 --> 00:43.625
Sam, why can't you believe
that she's okay?

00:44.834 --> 00:47.625
Would you be?

00:47.667 --> 00:49.000

Running's for idiots.

00:51.834 --> 00:55.375
Oh, it's so good having you
living here again.

00:55.417 --> 00:59.500
It makes my mornings 100 percent
more interesting.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.709
And the evenings? Whew.

01:02.750 --> 01:05.208
Yeah,
they're pretty awesome too.

01:20.625 --> 01:23.792
Whoa. Hey, could you hold that?
Whew.

01:23.834 --> 01:24.917
( exhales )

01:24.959 --> 01:27.041
Where you going?
Fifth floor.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.709
Me too.

01:31.709 --> 01:32.917
First visit?

01:32.959 --> 01:35.500
Yeah. I've, uh,
been avoiding this.

01:35.542 --> 01:37.333
( elevator bell dings )

01:37.375 --> 01:39.709
Don't worry. You're gonna love
everybody in there.

01:39.750 --> 01:42.333
Oh, sorry.
Hey.

01:43.542 --> 01:45.959
You cannot be here.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.542
Who needs cereal when you can
have chocolate cupcakes?

01:54.583 --> 01:57.834
You take my husband and all
I get are chocolate cupcakes?

01:57.875 --> 02:00.250
Wha--? Uh...

02:00.291 --> 02:01.667
Wow, as far as guilt gifts go,

02:01.709 --> 02:02.875
you kind of cheaped out
a little.

02:02.917 --> 02:04.959
No, no, Nai. That's not
what this is. I, uh...

02:05.000 --> 02:09.041
I didn't mean to, um...

02:09.083 --> 02:10.750
( laughing )

02:10.792 --> 02:13.458
I'm kidding.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.750
Oh.

02:15.792 --> 02:18.041
Good.
I'm fine, Addison.

02:18.083 --> 02:21.041
I'm okay. I'm fine.
We're fine.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.333
Mm.
Okay.

02:22.375 --> 02:26.458
Well, um, thank you
for being so understanding, Nai.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.917
Well,
I'm not doing it for you.

02:27.959 --> 02:30.750
With Dell and Maya and William,
I'm just, uh--

02:30.792 --> 02:32.500
I'm letting it all go.

02:32.542 --> 02:35.166
I'm just-- I'm done carrying
around all my anger.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.709
SAM:
Get the hell out of here.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.333
Get the hell out of here.
PETE: Easy, Sam.

02:39.375 --> 02:41.083
You got some nerve
showing up like this.

02:41.125 --> 02:42.542
I need to talk to you.
What's going on?

02:42.583 --> 02:44.083
It's the guy that hit
Maya and Dell.

02:44.125 --> 02:45.792
HAGEN:
I am so sorry.

02:45.834 --> 02:48.583
No. No. You don't get a chance
to be sorry.

02:48.625 --> 02:50.375
He doesn't get a chance
to apologize.

02:50.417 --> 02:52.041
Is that--?
That's the guy.

02:52.083 --> 02:54.041
I would give anything
to take it back, but I can't.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.417
Look, I made a deal with the
prosecutor. I'm being sentenced.

02:56.458 --> 02:59.125
I'll go to jail. I deserve that.
But I just wanted--

02:59.166 --> 03:01.792
I don't know.
If you could forgive me?

03:01.834 --> 03:03.542
Sam!
Hey!

03:03.583 --> 03:05.625
As far as I'm concerned--
ADDISON: Let him go. Sam.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.083
--you shouldn't even be alive.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.625
Let him go right now, Sam.
COOPER: Sam.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.792
Someone call 911.

03:11.834 --> 03:14.041
HAGEN: Oh, my chest.
ADDISON: Get the oxygen.

03:14.083 --> 03:18.250
Take slow, deep breaths.
Breathe. Breathe.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.125
Sam, I know you're upset,
but to choke this man...

03:25.166 --> 03:26.458
Do you--?
Do you know I'm upset?

03:26.500 --> 03:28.000
Yes, of course,
I understand, but...

03:28.041 --> 03:30.041
SAM:
Because you should've been
choking him with me.

03:30.083 --> 03:31.959
Why?
Instead of standing back...

03:32.000 --> 03:34.750
What do you expect me to do?
I expect you to back me up.

03:34.792 --> 03:36.166
Back you up?
She's your daughter.

03:36.208 --> 03:37.583
Of course.
I want you to remember.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.041
NAOMI:
I went through the same thing.

03:39.083 --> 03:40.625
SAM:
Remember her in that bed.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.041
What's that about?
Chickens coming home to roost.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.500
What if you killed that man?
We...

03:44.542 --> 03:45.917
Can somebody translate?

03:45.959 --> 03:48.041
The guy who killed Dell
showed up to apologize.

03:48.083 --> 03:51.583
And Sam took matters into his
own hands literally, like:

03:51.625 --> 03:53.458
Well, good for Sam.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.583
The guy should've just crawled
into a hole and disappeared.

03:56.625 --> 03:58.041
Give the guy credit
for having the guts

03:58.083 --> 03:59.667
to walk through the door
and face all of us.

03:59.709 --> 04:01.458
He had to know the reception
he was gonna get.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.041
PETE:
If he almost killed my kid,

04:03.083 --> 04:06.041
I'd make sure he rotted in
prison for the rest of his life.

04:06.083 --> 04:08.417
Don't you have things to do?
CHARLOTTE: I don't think so.

04:08.458 --> 04:10.083
I'm kind of clear.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.250
NAOMI:
I hate what he did
every bit as much as you,

04:12.291 --> 04:14.041
but that doesn't mean
you can go and attack him.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.709
Why are you defending him?
I am not defending him, Sam.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.250
But he did come here
to apologize.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.041
Apologize?

04:20.083 --> 04:24.333
Apologize for killing Dell
and almost killing our daughter?

04:24.375 --> 04:26.834
What kind of apology--?
Sam, I don't know!

04:26.875 --> 04:29.041
I don't know. You didn't give
the man a chance to speak.

04:29.083 --> 04:32.917
I spoke to the hospital
and, um,

04:32.959 --> 04:34.041
Troy Hagen is stable,

04:34.083 --> 04:37.291
but his EKG does show signs
of new changes.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.125
Sam, are you okay?

04:41.166 --> 04:43.625
I don't know what that guy needs
to say to make you feel good

04:43.667 --> 04:46.500
about him getting drunk
and driving into Maya and Dell.

04:46.542 --> 04:49.667
He killed a man.
He doesn't get my forgiveness.

04:49.709 --> 04:51.500
Maybe you can calm him down.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.125
Sam, can we please--?

04:53.166 --> 04:56.291
Some things don't deserve
to be forgiven.

05:00.041 --> 05:01.041
( curtain opens )

05:01.083 --> 05:02.291
MAN:
What do we have?

05:02.333 --> 05:03.667
Forty-five-year-old teacher,

05:03.709 --> 05:05.333
passed out in the middle
of a school play.

05:05.375 --> 05:08.041
Now he's complaining
about persistent chest pains.

05:08.083 --> 05:09.667
It looks like an acute MI.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.750
What's your plan?
He needs to go up for bypass.

05:11.792 --> 05:14.458
( pager beeping )

05:14.500 --> 05:16.333
I've got a stab wound
to the chest to deal with.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.291
Get him to the OR.
If you need any help--

05:18.333 --> 05:19.458
I'm good.
You sure?

05:19.500 --> 05:20.458
Absolutely.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.583
( sighs )

05:24.041 --> 05:28.041
Okay, thanks. Let's go.

05:28.083 --> 05:30.583
CHILD:
When is he coming back?

05:32.083 --> 05:34.750
The kids refused to finish the
show. They're really worried.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.542
We're gonna do the best we can,
sir.

05:36.583 --> 05:38.291
Okay, so I guess this means
no dinner?

05:38.333 --> 05:39.291
Oh, no.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.625
We were to meet
Derek and Addison

05:40.667 --> 05:42.125
at the restaurant
in 20 minutes.

05:42.166 --> 05:43.709
Oh, well, there's Addison,

05:43.750 --> 05:45.500
so I guess Derek's
at the restaurant by himself.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.125
You're doing a bypass
on your own.

05:47.166 --> 05:48.583
Yeah. I just got it.
Yeah?

05:48.625 --> 05:50.500
Well, I just picked up
a bilateral oophorectomy.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.041
I don't start cutting
for a couple hours.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.125
Maybe, uh, I can watch?

05:53.166 --> 05:55.083
All right, you guys have fun.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.750
I have a baby-sitter
and Derek made the reservations.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.417
I'm having dinner
with your husband.

05:59.458 --> 06:00.792
I'll try not to steal him.

06:00.834 --> 06:03.041
Apologize to Derek for me?
NAOMI: Okay.

06:03.083 --> 06:05.375
Bye-bye.

06:05.417 --> 06:06.458
What's wrong?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.375
Do me a favor.
Take this to Radiology.

06:08.417 --> 06:10.458
Ask them for a CT angio
before the OR.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.583
Sure.
Thanks.

06:11.625 --> 06:12.834
All right, come on, guys.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.834
Is it worse than you thought?
Uh, it might be.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.834
I just-- If there's a chance
I'm not gonna make it,

06:17.875 --> 06:20.333
I need to talk to somebody.
We can do that for you.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.750
Do you need a priest?
I've done some bad things.

06:22.792 --> 06:25.583
And every day I tell myself
that I'm gonna stop,

06:25.625 --> 06:28.041
but I can't.
Mr. Yates.

06:28.083 --> 06:31.625
I know they're only children,
but I can't help myself.

06:31.667 --> 06:34.041
I need to touch them.

06:34.083 --> 06:36.959
I try, but I can't stop.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.041
And I'm so sorry.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.583
Hey. Are you okay?

06:50.625 --> 06:52.208
I will be.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.917
I was with that guy
on the elevator.

06:54.959 --> 06:57.375
He seemed nice.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.333
I had no idea.

07:00.834 --> 07:03.625
Maybe this is not a good time.
No, please, distract me.

07:03.667 --> 07:06.208
Okay. You should hire me.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.834
Don't beat around the bush
on my account.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.041
Well, you've got
a nice little practice here.

07:10.083 --> 07:11.250
The baby thing is covered.

07:11.291 --> 07:12.834
You've got shrinks
for the screw-ups.

07:12.875 --> 07:15.542
Specialists to handle everything
from heart attacks to hernias.

07:15.583 --> 07:18.750
What you don't have
is a neurosurgeon.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.625
I'm listening.

07:20.667 --> 07:22.125
I graduated
top of my class at Harvard.

07:22.166 --> 07:23.959
I did my residency
at Johns Hopkins.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.542
I have published
enough research

07:25.583 --> 07:27.959
to single-handedly wipe out
several forests.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.834
I'm the real deal, Naomi.

07:29.875 --> 07:32.041
I'm a kick-ass,
world-class catch.

07:32.083 --> 07:35.250
Did Addison coach you
on how to sell yourself?

07:35.291 --> 07:36.542
No, we haven't discussed it yet.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.250
But you are the big boss now,
right?

07:39.291 --> 07:42.041
Look, Amelia, you obviously have
impressive credentials.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.750
But this practice
is about cooperative medicine,

07:44.792 --> 07:46.166
not solo surgeries.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.667
You could go anywhere you want.
Why here?

07:48.709 --> 07:52.041
I like to cut.
I won't deny that.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.542
But...

07:53.583 --> 07:56.041
I think that this would be
a good environment

07:56.083 --> 07:57.583
for me to broaden my skill set.

07:57.625 --> 07:59.333
Don't give me
the rehearsed answer.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.458
I have nowhere else to go

08:05.500 --> 08:07.667
where I'm not alone.

08:07.709 --> 08:08.750
Derek forgave me, but...

08:11.875 --> 08:13.333
I have nowhere else to go.

08:15.792 --> 08:17.750
Oh, hey.
I just wanted to let you know

08:17.792 --> 08:19.041
I ordered us the new bed today.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.709
I hope you like it.
Don't see why I wouldn't.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.792
Well, you know,
it's a lot firmer.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.333
It's basically
just a wooden plank.

08:24.375 --> 08:25.959
I don't know
if that's your thing, but...

08:26.000 --> 08:27.333
Oh, yeah,
and we're getting a dog.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.166
A mastiff, 160 pounds,
very drooly.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.542
Gonna sleep in the bed with us.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.959
Dog Whisperer, whatever
you've gotta say, spit it out.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.583
Because I have to get
to the hospital

08:34.625 --> 08:37.125
before Hagen's heart peters out
or Sam rips it from his chest.

08:37.166 --> 08:40.583
Why are you house-hunting
without me?

08:40.625 --> 08:42.625
Pull up your bra strap, Coop.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.333
I hired a Realtor
when you kicked me out.

08:44.375 --> 08:45.583
Then we got engaged,

08:45.625 --> 08:47.333
so I told her to look
for something bigger.

08:47.375 --> 08:48.792
It's a house, Charlotte.

08:48.834 --> 08:51.291
It's kind of a big deal.

08:52.583 --> 08:55.750
Okay, but we need to move.

08:55.792 --> 08:57.458
What's wrong with the loft?

08:57.500 --> 09:00.417
It's too grungy. Your neighbors
are freakishly chipper.

09:00.458 --> 09:01.583
And it'd be nice
to sleep with you

09:01.625 --> 09:03.041
in a place
that wasn't a fond memory

09:03.083 --> 09:04.417
for half the tramps in L.A.

09:04.458 --> 09:05.792
You know that's not fair.

09:05.834 --> 09:08.000
I went out of my way to make
that place feel like ours.

09:08.041 --> 09:09.792
I took down
all the vintage Houdini posters.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.583
I let you re-do the bathroom
the way you like.

09:11.625 --> 09:12.875
I'm doing cartwheels.

09:12.917 --> 09:14.250
Can we at least agree
it's something

09:14.291 --> 09:16.291
that we should consider
together?

09:17.500 --> 09:19.000
Fine.

09:20.625 --> 09:23.583
Seeing a house in the Palisades
tomorrow, 8:00.

09:23.625 --> 09:26.667
Stop whining
and you can join me.

09:28.709 --> 09:32.041
This guy, he's got a piece of
phosphorous stuck in his thigh.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.083
He's screaming like hell
because that stuff burns.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.166
A bullet wound in his back--

09:35.208 --> 09:37.166
Pete's got his hand on my shirt

09:37.208 --> 09:38.875
and he's trying to drag me out
of the hut.

09:38.917 --> 09:40.583
PETE:
The hut was on fire.

09:40.625 --> 09:42.291
Ugandan rebel army
was about to get there--

09:42.333 --> 09:44.500
It was Eritrea. And I wasn't
gonna leave the guy.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.041
Uganda. And it was either leave
you there or let you get shot.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.750
Can somebody tell me
what happened to the guy?

09:52.583 --> 09:54.667
We got him out.

09:54.709 --> 09:55.709
( all laugh )

09:55.750 --> 09:56.625
We stabilized him,

09:56.667 --> 09:58.208
then together we carried him
four miles

09:58.250 --> 10:00.542
to the nearest refugee camp.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.125
You know, Violet,
I like you.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.333
You're beautiful, you're smart.

10:05.375 --> 10:07.333
What the hell are you doing
with this guy?

10:07.375 --> 10:08.667
I haven't figured that out yet.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.667
Would you stop flirting?
Get your own wife.

10:10.709 --> 10:14.041
This is ridiculous. You've been
in town running your clinic

10:14.083 --> 10:15.208
for, what, six months,

10:15.250 --> 10:16.500
and this is the first time
we've met?

10:16.542 --> 10:18.542
Gibby is impossible
to nail down.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.041
The guy doesn't even have
a cell phone.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.500
Never found much use for them
in the jungle.

10:21.542 --> 10:24.041
( doorbell rings )

10:24.083 --> 10:26.583
Excuse me.

10:26.625 --> 10:27.792
( doorbell ringing )

10:27.834 --> 10:30.375
( knock on door )

10:30.417 --> 10:31.500
( man groans )

10:31.542 --> 10:35.041
Come in. Come in.
Dr. Gibson, it's my husband.

10:35.083 --> 10:39.041
We were making dinner and he had
bad pains in his belly.

10:39.083 --> 10:41.583
It's getting worse.

10:42.750 --> 10:45.500
( groaning )

10:45.542 --> 10:47.583
Rock hard.
Could be a perfed appy.

10:47.625 --> 10:49.000
I'll call an ambulance.
No, wait.

10:51.583 --> 10:56.291
Give me a hand. On three.
One, two, three.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.583
Take him down there.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.875
( groaning )

11:08.792 --> 11:11.041
What are you doing?

11:11.083 --> 11:13.000
Saving his life.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.750
( soft dramatic theme playing )

11:17.792 --> 11:20.625
Come on, Gibby. We can drive him
to the hospital right now.

11:27.792 --> 11:28.750
This is insane.

11:28.792 --> 11:30.166
You could lose your license.

11:30.208 --> 11:31.750
You could be sued
for malpractice.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.667
Or I could save his life so his
wife doesn't become a widow,

11:34.709 --> 11:36.792
so his kids don't lose
their father.

11:38.625 --> 11:39.834
( sighs )

11:39.875 --> 11:43.000
The belly's full of pus.
I could really use a hand.

11:44.792 --> 11:46.333
Okay.
Pete.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.000
Just until we get him
stabilized.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.417
And then I'm out of here.
I promise.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.250
( sighs )

12:16.083 --> 12:18.542
Uh, I'm tired.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.834
Sam, you had a right
to get angry today.

12:28.875 --> 12:30.041
I know.
I mean, he hit Maya.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.667
I don't wanna talk about it.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.417
Sam--
I'm tired.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.041
( sighs )

12:38.083 --> 12:39.542
Good night.

12:39.583 --> 12:42.583
( soft theme playing )

12:54.000 --> 12:56.417
Hey. What do you think,

12:56.458 --> 12:58.041
diplomas behind the desk
or on the side wall?

12:58.083 --> 13:00.917
So this is one of the things
you were gonna catch me up on?

13:00.959 --> 13:03.458
Pretty cool, huh?
Can you hand me that box?

13:03.500 --> 13:06.625
Sure.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.542
Hey, I hope I didn't keep you up
last night.

13:08.583 --> 13:10.500
I was nervous
about Naomi's decision,

13:10.542 --> 13:12.250
so I just got up
and watched a movie.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.709
Uh, no, I was at Sam's.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.125
I didn't even know
you were in the house.

13:17.166 --> 13:19.917
So, um, how was Seattle?

13:21.792 --> 13:24.667
I had sex with Mark Sloan.
That man has skills.

13:24.709 --> 13:26.041
( laughs )

13:26.083 --> 13:28.917
Face like an angel,
hips like the devil, huh? Ha-ha.

13:28.959 --> 13:31.500
Right?
Right.

13:31.542 --> 13:33.041
Anyway,
it's all turning around for me.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.000
I mean,
Derek and I are back on track

13:35.041 --> 13:36.583
and I am starting
this fantastic new job.

13:36.625 --> 13:40.083
New job.
What?

13:40.125 --> 13:41.291
It's just a little weird

13:41.333 --> 13:43.083
that Naomi didn't mention this
to me.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.709
We usually-- We make these
decisions as a group.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.792
Oh, she probably figured
you wouldn't mind.

13:49.542 --> 13:50.792
I mean, you don't, do you?

13:50.834 --> 13:52.834
No, of course not.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.208
First earthquake,

13:59.250 --> 14:02.166
that house just tumbles
right down that hill.

14:02.208 --> 14:05.166
Being on a hill is what gives it
those amazing ocean views.

14:05.208 --> 14:06.542
It's gonna have
an even better view

14:06.583 --> 14:08.208
when it lands
in the actual ocean.

14:08.250 --> 14:09.583
You're just punishing me

14:09.625 --> 14:11.041
because I started looking
without you.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.625
You're not listening,
Charlotte.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.583
I don't wanna look at all.

14:15.959 --> 14:17.458
Well, I hate your place, Cooper.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.750
Because it reminds me of all
the things I screwed up,

14:19.792 --> 14:21.542
all the fights we had.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.959
You not letting me in the front
door after you found out

14:24.000 --> 14:25.750
I was building
the practice downstairs.

14:25.792 --> 14:28.417
Standing like an idiot with the
corn bread chicken casserole

14:28.458 --> 14:30.125
in your bedroom,
trying to make up

14:30.166 --> 14:31.667
after I tried to force you
to elope.

14:31.709 --> 14:34.041
Fighting over
that damn latex jumpsuit

14:34.083 --> 14:36.625
after I bought you
into the practice.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.375
And we can't move forward

14:38.417 --> 14:40.166
if that's staring me in the face
every day.

14:41.792 --> 14:44.375
You never told me
any of this.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.583
Well, now you know.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.625
So...

14:50.667 --> 14:53.041
Amelia works here now.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.834
Yeah, I know. I hired her.

14:56.291 --> 14:59.875
It's a little weird that you
decided without telling me.

14:59.917 --> 15:03.208
Well, you decided to sleep
with my ex without telling me.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.500
Wow.

15:09.625 --> 15:12.875
Seriously?
Well, you know--

15:12.917 --> 15:14.709
Babies are tiny terrorists.

15:14.750 --> 15:16.625
I'm dying
from sleep deprivation.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.083
Lucas was up five times
last night.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.667
Where was Pete?
He was operating. In a house.

15:21.709 --> 15:23.667
His friend runs
a neighborhood clinic

15:23.709 --> 15:24.959
and he sees no problem

15:25.000 --> 15:26.625
with performing emergency
surgeries there.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.709
I-- That cannot be legal.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.542
Probably not the biggest concern
his patients have.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.041
He's doing surgeries in a house.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.417
Well, I didn't say I agreed
with it, but I get it.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.875
The people he treats probably
don't have money or insurance.

15:36.917 --> 15:39.083
They're scared of trying
to navigate the system--

15:39.125 --> 15:40.709
Even a county hospital
is better equipped

15:40.750 --> 15:43.667
to deal with emergencies
than someone's living room.

15:43.709 --> 15:46.500
We're talking surgery
in an unsterile environment.

15:46.542 --> 15:48.542
The risk of staph infection
is huge and--

15:48.583 --> 15:50.959
Because nobody ever got
a staph infection in a hospital.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.041
Okay. Fine. Well, what about
if something goes wrong?

15:54.083 --> 15:56.041
Gibby doesn't have the resources
to deal with that.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.000
Things go wrong
in hospitals too.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.000
And I'm minding my own business.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.542
I know you're mad
that I stayed but--

16:03.583 --> 16:04.875
That guy could have died.

16:04.917 --> 16:07.041
But he didn't and he's home
recovering with his family.

16:07.083 --> 16:08.750
So that justifies
what you did?

16:08.792 --> 16:10.375
I helped a friend
save a guy's life.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.750
Gibby is helping himself.
Look, I know.

16:12.792 --> 16:14.667
I know he's trying to do
something good here,

16:14.709 --> 16:16.041
but there's--
There's better ways.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.166
There's safer ways
of doing that.

16:18.208 --> 16:21.667
Only none of them feed the God
complex that he's got going on.

16:21.709 --> 16:23.709
( scoffs )

16:26.709 --> 16:29.041
The patient has CAD
with crescendo angina.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.709
My plan is to cool him down,
then do a three-way bypass.

16:31.750 --> 16:34.625
I'll schedule an OR
for you.

16:37.542 --> 16:40.125
I called in Campbell
to handle Mr. Hagen's case.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.750
She's gonna do a CABG.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.625
I don't wanna know.
Okay. I respect that.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.000
( typing )

16:47.750 --> 16:49.500
( suspenseful theme playing )

16:49.542 --> 16:51.583
You want me to leave this up?

16:51.625 --> 16:54.166
What? No.

16:54.208 --> 16:57.000
Are you sure, Sam?
Yeah, I gotta go.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.041
Hagen did ask
to speak to you.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.208
I told him I'd pass it along.

17:02.250 --> 17:05.041
I told you
I don't wanna deal with this.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.041
( ominous theme playing )

17:14.250 --> 17:15.375
ADDISON:
What is it?

17:15.417 --> 17:16.792
SAM:
Double lumen on a aortic arch.

17:16.834 --> 17:19.375
A dissecting aneurysm?
Yeah.

17:19.417 --> 17:20.625
A different surgery
altogether.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.375
Are you gonna get
your attending up here?

17:22.417 --> 17:24.542
No. I'm gonna scrub in.

17:24.583 --> 17:27.458
Are you sure?

17:27.500 --> 17:29.917
He's a child molester.
What?

17:31.583 --> 17:32.875
He thinks that he's gonna die,

17:32.917 --> 17:35.458
so he wanted to get it
off his chest.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.000
He's a pedophile.
Sam.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.792
I'm doing the surgery.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.166
I can handle it.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.000
( dramatic theme playing )

17:49.083 --> 17:50.500
Hey.
Hold still.

17:50.542 --> 17:52.792
( speaking
in foreign language )

17:52.834 --> 17:55.083
One more minute.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.709
Hey.
You're back.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.000
And with gifts.

17:59.041 --> 18:00.583
I noticed you were running low
on supplies.

18:00.625 --> 18:03.667
Oh, thanks, man. You're a
lifesaver. Last night too.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.583
I hope that didn't rock the boat
at home.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.375
It'll blow over.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.667
Listen, I've been thinking about
your setup here

18:09.709 --> 18:12.917
and I've got some contacts
at surgery centers.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.500
Let me see what kind of deal
I can work out for you.

18:15.542 --> 18:18.041
Pete, most of my patients
don't even have cars.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.667
None of them wanna be part of
a system that's failed them.

18:20.709 --> 18:23.041
I'm fine with what I got.
One surgery goes wrong--

18:23.083 --> 18:24.834
I don't remember you
being such a worrier.

18:24.875 --> 18:26.667
( girl whimpers )

18:26.709 --> 18:28.083
What's wrong
with that little girl?

18:28.125 --> 18:30.625
I don't know. I haven't had time
to check her out yet.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.041
This is triage, man.
You know the game.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.667
The sicker ones go first.

18:33.709 --> 18:34.667
( girl crying )

18:34.709 --> 18:37.625
( man speaks in Spanish )

18:37.667 --> 18:39.583
Hi.
Can I look at your arm?

18:41.542 --> 18:43.500
( speaks in Spanish )

18:43.542 --> 18:44.834
( cries )

18:44.875 --> 18:46.583
( speaking in Spanish )

18:46.625 --> 18:50.083
It's popped out of its socket.
Here. It's okay.

18:53.083 --> 18:54.083
( joint pops )

18:54.125 --> 18:56.583
There. Okay?

18:59.625 --> 19:01.000
Okay.

19:01.041 --> 19:02.750
( speaks in Spanish )

19:02.792 --> 19:05.792
Okay. Who's next?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.583
Troy Hagen's
refusing treatment.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.250
But he has unstable angina.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.041
He's gonna die
if he doesn't have surgery.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.458
Seems to be the point.
Well, it's his choice.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.542
Maybe he's trying to skip jail?

19:20.583 --> 19:23.083
He's not. He feels like
he doesn't deserve to live.

19:23.125 --> 19:25.375
Well, has anyone asked Sam
to talk to him?

19:25.417 --> 19:26.959
Asked Sam to talk to who
about what?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.542
Someone has to convince Hagen
to have surgery.

19:29.583 --> 19:30.959
Why?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.208
I thought you guys
were all into helping people.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.375
Oh, screw him.

19:35.417 --> 19:37.041
I get that you're
emotional about this.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.333
I mean, the guy made a mistake.

19:38.375 --> 19:40.000
Does that mean
that he deserves to die?

19:40.041 --> 19:42.208
Isn't the question whether
we have to go out of our way

19:42.250 --> 19:43.542
to help him live?

19:50.208 --> 19:53.125
Hey. Where have you been?
Hey.

19:53.166 --> 19:54.542
I've been calling you
for hours.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.166
I was at the clinic
with Gibby.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.041
I was treating patients.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.542
You missed
three appointments.

19:59.583 --> 20:02.041
I know.
I'll ask them to reschedule.

20:02.083 --> 20:04.458
I've decided to volunteer at the
clinic one afternoon a week.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.250
Pete.
There were 20 people

20:06.291 --> 20:08.041
in his waiting room
and more standing outside.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.041
People who have nowhere to go,
who need help.

20:10.083 --> 20:13.000
You help people here every day.
It's not the same.

20:13.041 --> 20:15.250
Our clients have money, they can
pay for the care we give.

20:15.291 --> 20:17.625
These people have nothing.
They need me.

20:17.667 --> 20:19.041
I get it.
And it's noble.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.125
It's just too risky, you know.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.750
For Gibby, for the patients,
for you.

20:22.792 --> 20:24.041
Okay, spare me the sermon.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.792
I don't wanna give you
a sermon. I just--

20:25.834 --> 20:27.583
I want you to think
about what you're doing.

20:27.625 --> 20:30.041
I know what I'm doing,
Violet.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.750
( melancholic theme playing )

20:43.542 --> 20:45.041
I thought you'd
already be cutting.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.000
Hey. I'm heading in right now.

20:47.041 --> 20:49.250
Well, I'm glad I caught you.
Um...

20:49.291 --> 20:53.291
I wore this cap for my first
solo surgery, so it's good luck.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.166
Well, I'm already scrubbed in,
so could you?

20:55.208 --> 20:57.125
Sure.

20:58.709 --> 21:01.000
You okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.083
Sam.
Hmm?

21:05.125 --> 21:08.041
You can do this.
Yeah, I know I can.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.709
I've done grafts
on a hundred pig hearts.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.375
It's not what I meant.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.500
I have a daughter, Addison.

21:16.542 --> 21:19.041
A daughter who's younger
than those kids waiting.

21:19.083 --> 21:20.333
It's irrelevant.

21:20.375 --> 21:21.667
Irrelevant?
You're his surgeon.

21:21.709 --> 21:23.083
Only thing
that should concern you.

21:23.125 --> 21:24.500
Your job isn't to judge his
life.

21:24.542 --> 21:26.041
Your job is to save his life.
That's all.

21:26.083 --> 21:28.500
Right?

21:33.041 --> 21:34.750
( melancholic theme playing )

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Hey. I--

21:47.041 --> 21:49.709
You need to convince Sam
to talk to Troy Hagen.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.667
I thought we weren't talking
about Sam.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.583
No, I can talk about Sam.
You don't get to.

21:53.625 --> 21:56.291
But, uh, you do need
to straighten him out.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.792
This is not something that is up
for discussion with him.

21:58.834 --> 22:00.375
I know Sam and--

22:00.417 --> 22:02.583
No, no. I know Sam.
You're just sleeping with him.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.166
I'm sorry.

22:08.792 --> 22:11.375
I'm sorry.

22:11.417 --> 22:14.709
You really wanna be with Sam?

22:14.750 --> 22:16.709
You need to be with him.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.583
You got to be his sounding
board. His conscience.

22:19.625 --> 22:22.834
You need to kick him in
the behind when he needs it.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.041
You've got a stubborn man
on your hands, Addison,

22:25.083 --> 22:27.625
and it's not okay to just walk
away when things get hard.

22:31.166 --> 22:32.417
Step up.

22:32.458 --> 22:34.875
( tense theme playing )

22:41.500 --> 22:44.041
( people chattering )

22:44.083 --> 22:46.792
Hey, you're not gonna tell Pete,
are you?

22:46.834 --> 22:49.625
What? That we're having lunch
on a non-prescribed day?

22:49.667 --> 22:51.250
I'm gonna keep Charlotte
in the dark.

22:51.291 --> 22:53.208
I don't even think Pete
would care now.

22:53.250 --> 22:55.583
All he's thinking about
is how to get back to the jungle

22:55.625 --> 22:58.041
where he can perform open-heart
surgery with a pen-knife.

22:58.083 --> 22:59.875
You hate the jungle.
You don't like grass.

22:59.917 --> 23:02.625
I think he's struggling
with the path not taken.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.458
Wait, I thought he already
took that path

23:04.500 --> 23:06.041
and then got off, didn't--?

23:06.083 --> 23:07.250
Well, being around Gibby

23:07.291 --> 23:09.750
has obviously tapped
into something, you know.

23:09.792 --> 23:12.000
He's so--
He's so happy and re-energized.

23:12.041 --> 23:14.500
And, no, I want him to be happy.
I do. I just--

23:14.542 --> 23:17.250
Not at any cost.

23:17.291 --> 23:19.041
Pete's no dummy.
He's making a choice.

23:19.083 --> 23:22.000
Just like Charlotte who's just
deciding she hates my apartment.

23:22.041 --> 23:23.667
We're on to you now?
She wants to move.

23:23.709 --> 23:26.291
It's your bachelor pad, Cooper.
You can't blame her.

23:26.333 --> 23:29.041
No more than you can
blame Pete.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.500
So, what are we gonna do?

23:31.542 --> 23:33.709
Well,
you're the shrink.

23:33.750 --> 23:36.917
What would you tell
a patient?

23:36.959 --> 23:41.041
I would say you have to confront
your problems.

23:41.083 --> 23:43.542
Be honest. And then, you know,
whatever happens, happens.

23:45.041 --> 23:46.208
People pay you for that?

23:48.583 --> 23:50.000
( upbeat theme playing )

23:52.667 --> 23:54.625
Hey.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.041
Wow, that looks like
not even a little bit fun.

23:57.083 --> 24:00.166
Yeah. It's just this
foundation paperwork.

24:00.208 --> 24:01.667
I-I don't even know
where to begin.

24:01.709 --> 24:03.041
Much more interested
in just looking

24:03.083 --> 24:05.542
at pictures of Olivia.
Aww.

24:05.583 --> 24:09.458
Okay, that baby has my ears too.
It must be me.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.041
I have baby ears.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.083
( laughs )

24:12.125 --> 24:14.542
Let me see. No.

24:16.959 --> 24:18.750
Did you need something?

24:18.792 --> 24:23.250
Well, I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

24:23.291 --> 24:24.500
Oh.

24:24.542 --> 24:27.125
Having Troy Hagen show up,
yeah, that really threw me.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.250
Yeah.

24:29.291 --> 24:30.959
And I miss William.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.166
But I was talking more about
the whole Sam and Addison thing.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.291
And I know from having to watch
Violet and Pete,

24:37.333 --> 24:38.583
and Charlotte and Cooper,

24:38.625 --> 24:40.959
that it can make work
a little awkward.

24:41.041 --> 24:43.041
I'm fine. You know, Sam and I,
we had our shot.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.041
And seems only fair
that he and Addison

24:45.083 --> 24:46.125
should have theirs, so I'm fine.

24:46.166 --> 24:48.083
Well, that's an admirable
position to take.

24:48.125 --> 24:50.166
I don't wanna be someone
who can't move forward.

24:50.208 --> 24:53.041
Sure. Sure.

24:53.083 --> 24:55.625
But sometimes what we wanna be
and what we actually feel

24:55.667 --> 24:58.625
can be two different things.

24:58.667 --> 25:02.417
I'm not proud of it,
but once when no one was around,

25:02.458 --> 25:03.875
I licked Pete's bagel.

25:05.083 --> 25:07.041
Okay, I'm a little proud of it.

25:07.083 --> 25:08.125
( both laugh )

25:08.166 --> 25:10.500
My point is that you should
give yourself permission

25:10.542 --> 25:12.750
to use whatever kind
of a coping mechanism you need.

25:12.792 --> 25:14.625
Screaming, crying,

25:14.667 --> 25:17.709
maybe even a dart board
with both their faces.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.000
Do whatever you need to do.

25:21.083 --> 25:24.542
Trust me, I'm licensed to give
that kind of advice.

25:32.083 --> 25:34.125
VIOLET:
What are you doing?

25:34.166 --> 25:36.375
Gibby called.
He has an emergency.

25:36.417 --> 25:38.041
Call an ambulance.
Let them deal with it.

25:38.083 --> 25:39.250
That's not the way this works.

25:39.291 --> 25:40.875
That's exactly
how this works.

25:40.917 --> 25:42.041
When you have an emergency,

25:42.083 --> 25:44.000
call 911 and they take you
to the hospital.

25:45.792 --> 25:47.625
I knew you wouldn't understand.
Then talk to me.

25:47.667 --> 25:51.458
Explain to me why my husband
would risk everything,

25:51.500 --> 25:54.834
his practice, his medical
license, his family,

25:54.875 --> 25:57.041
because some old ghost
from his past asked him to.

25:58.583 --> 26:00.583
I miss this kind of work, okay?

26:00.625 --> 26:03.083
The rush of it.
The way it makes me feel.

26:03.125 --> 26:06.875
I knew you wouldn't understand.
Hey, hey, hey.

26:06.917 --> 26:09.083
I used to work
with inner-city single moms.

26:09.125 --> 26:10.625
I used to counsel rape victims.

26:10.667 --> 26:13.625
I ran a suicide hotline.
I do understand.

26:13.667 --> 26:15.375
But I didn't break any laws
doing it.

26:15.417 --> 26:17.041
Don't wait up.

26:17.083 --> 26:19.041
( tender pop music playing )

26:32.083 --> 26:34.250
Why are you lurking?

26:34.291 --> 26:37.583
I'm not lurking.
I do not lurk.

26:40.792 --> 26:44.041
About the--
This whole Troy Hagen thing...

26:44.083 --> 26:45.583
I don't wanna
talk about him.

26:49.959 --> 26:51.041
What, Addison?

26:54.083 --> 26:58.041
Why did you quit
doing heart surgery before?

26:58.083 --> 27:00.792
Why?
I'm not discussing that.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.083
Sam.
Just leave it alone.

27:02.125 --> 27:03.875
No.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.458
That patient, that pedophile,

27:08.500 --> 27:10.333
and now Troy Hagen.

27:10.375 --> 27:12.500
Just shut up, please?

27:12.542 --> 27:14.500
Shut up.

27:16.792 --> 27:19.125
What did you do, Sam?

27:23.417 --> 27:27.542
Doctors choose to do nothing
all the time.

27:27.583 --> 27:29.792
You know it, I know it.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.333
It's the dirty little secret
of surgery.

27:33.375 --> 27:36.041
Doctors choose to do nothing.

27:36.083 --> 27:38.250
Wait. When the patient
is brain-dead

27:38.291 --> 27:40.041
or is gonna suffer
or is too far gone--

27:40.083 --> 27:43.000
Doctors choose to do nothing.

27:45.083 --> 27:48.375
They choose to do nothing
for the right reasons, Sam.

27:48.417 --> 27:52.709
Tell me. It's okay.
Just--

27:52.750 --> 27:54.625
What did you do?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.667
( monitor beeping )

28:11.583 --> 28:14.542
Okay, he's off bypass.

28:14.583 --> 28:15.750
( monitor beeping erratically )

28:15.792 --> 28:18.000
He's in fib. Lost his pulse.

28:22.583 --> 28:25.000
Dr. Bennett?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.250
SAM: Starting cardiac massage.
He's still in fib.

28:29.291 --> 28:31.250
Internal paddles ready.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.583
Dr. Bennett?

28:35.625 --> 28:37.417
No pulse with direct massage.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.458
You're losing him.
Should I page Dr. Warren?

28:41.208 --> 28:43.000
SAM:
No.

28:46.375 --> 28:47.750
( EKG flatlining )

28:47.792 --> 28:49.709
Asystole.

28:51.125 --> 28:54.750
Dr. Bennett?
Internal paddles ready.

28:58.875 --> 29:01.792
It's over. We should stop.

29:01.834 --> 29:03.709
But--
We should stop.

29:05.667 --> 29:08.375
( beeping stops )

29:08.417 --> 29:10.625
SAM:
Time of death, 20:13.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.000
( door closes )

29:18.250 --> 29:21.458
WOMAN ( over PA ):
Dr. Mendville, 8662.
Dr. Mendville--

29:21.500 --> 29:24.125
What the hell happened in there?
Keep your voice down.

29:24.166 --> 29:27.667
Sam-- Sam, tell me.
I made a judgment call.

29:27.709 --> 29:29.959
( children crying )

29:30.000 --> 29:32.041
I made a call.
It was a bad call.

29:32.083 --> 29:35.208
You don't know that.
Not for sure.

29:35.250 --> 29:38.041
Nobody knows that.
You know that.

29:38.083 --> 29:40.500
( group chattering )

29:40.542 --> 29:44.083
Look me in the eye.
Tell me that you didn't just--

29:44.125 --> 29:47.542
Addison, I made a call.
Leave it alone.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.250
( sighs )

29:54.291 --> 29:56.041
I'm done.

29:57.625 --> 30:00.041
What--?
I quit.

30:00.083 --> 30:02.000
( dramatic theme playing )

30:10.083 --> 30:13.792
I let everybody think that
I froze because it was easier,

30:13.834 --> 30:17.041
but I made a choice.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.333
You let him die.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.959
You knew.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.583
You knew I let him die.

30:23.625 --> 30:27.041
I didn't wanna believe it
and then you quit surgery,

30:27.083 --> 30:30.834
so I guess I just kind of
let it go.

30:32.083 --> 30:34.750
Not everybody
deserves our help.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.625
No, not everybody deserves
our respect. But our help?

30:37.667 --> 30:39.625
There's nothing you can say
right now

30:39.667 --> 30:41.583
that's gonna make me feel
any worse than I already do.

30:41.625 --> 30:43.417
Sam.

30:43.458 --> 30:45.375
That surgery was 12 years ago.

30:45.417 --> 30:47.291
You're a different--
You're a different man now.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.041
No, it doesn't matter.
Yeah, it does matter.

30:49.083 --> 30:52.500
It matters for you, for us.

30:52.542 --> 30:54.917
And Hagen, look, somebody else
is gonna do that surgery.

30:54.959 --> 30:57.041
And whatever happens,
it's not on you.

30:57.083 --> 30:59.000
No, it's all on me.

31:00.667 --> 31:04.750
I'm just asking you
to talk to Hagen.

31:06.083 --> 31:08.625
Murderer to murderer?

31:08.667 --> 31:10.667
( melancholic theme playing )

31:18.667 --> 31:19.834
PETE:
What happened?

31:19.875 --> 31:21.542
Girl took three bullets
to the abdomen.

31:21.583 --> 31:23.750
We were sitting in the car
and, uh, these guys pulled up

31:23.792 --> 31:27.417
and I told her to get down.
The bullets were for me.

31:27.458 --> 31:29.583
I get control of one bleeder,
two more open up.

31:29.625 --> 31:31.041
She's bleeding faster
than I can fix them.

31:31.083 --> 31:34.375
You can save her, right?
I mean, you gotta save her.

31:34.417 --> 31:35.792
We've gotta call an ambulance.

31:35.834 --> 31:37.041
No,
that wasn't part of the deal.

31:37.083 --> 31:39.041
What? Deal? Deal?

31:39.083 --> 31:41.709
GIBBY:
Alex and his friends pay me
some money from time to time.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.250
You're taking money
from gangbangers?

31:43.291 --> 31:44.583
Keeps the office going.

31:44.625 --> 31:46.500
Would you hand me
a 3.0 vicryl on a driver?

31:46.542 --> 31:48.041
So you look the other way
with criminals

31:48.083 --> 31:49.667
because they're the ones
that can pay?

31:49.709 --> 31:50.875
GIBBY:
For every Alex who can pay,

31:50.917 --> 31:52.583
I can treat a hundred patients
who can't.

31:52.625 --> 31:54.041
Don't tell me I'm doing
something wrong.

31:54.083 --> 31:56.041
You're risking peoples' lives.
Now ours.

31:56.083 --> 31:57.625
We used to do that
all the time.

31:57.667 --> 31:58.875
Back then you didn't
cry about it.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.875
Well, back then we didn't have
a choice. Now we do.

32:01.917 --> 32:03.041
( monitor beeping erratically )

32:03.083 --> 32:04.083
Her pressure's dropping.

32:04.125 --> 32:05.709
She needs blood,
platelets, FFP.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.333
Do something.
GIBBY: I don't have access.

32:07.375 --> 32:09.208
That's why she needs to be
in a hospital.

32:09.250 --> 32:11.583
We can cross-clamp her aorta.
Try to maintain CNS function.

32:13.959 --> 32:15.917
ALEX: Put down the phone.
Listen to me.

32:15.959 --> 32:17.500
Your girlfriend has
about five minutes

32:17.542 --> 32:19.333
before she bleeds out
on that table.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.041
And there is nothing, nothing,

32:21.083 --> 32:22.750
that we can do here
to change that.

32:22.792 --> 32:26.041
( suspenseful theme playing )

32:26.083 --> 32:29.000
Put down the gun.
Let me save her life.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.041
( cell phone beeps )

32:38.083 --> 32:40.625
Yeah,
I've got a teenaged female.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.959
Multiple gunshot wounds.
I need an ambulance.

32:51.041 --> 32:53.542
Hey, I was just coming
to find you.

32:53.583 --> 32:56.166
I talked to Sam--
"You're selfish, Addison.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.792
"You always have been.

32:57.834 --> 33:00.333
"The tunnel vision
that makes you a great surgeon

33:00.375 --> 33:02.333
also makes you a crappy friend."

33:02.375 --> 33:03.750
What--?
Please let me finish.

33:03.792 --> 33:04.959
Sheldon told me to do this.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.750
Just please.
I just-- Let me finish.

33:06.792 --> 33:10.667
"You're a cheater. And while Sam
and I aren't married anymore,

33:10.709 --> 33:12.375
"you knew what you were doing
was wrong,

33:12.417 --> 33:13.959
"and so you lied to me.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.625
"Every day, you didn't tell me
about the two of you, you lied.

33:17.667 --> 33:22.917
"Because you knew
telling the truth would be hard.

33:22.959 --> 33:26.500
"And you're a coward.
You're my best friend,

33:26.542 --> 33:29.041
"but when I look at you now,

33:29.083 --> 33:31.625
I just wanna slap you
across the face."

33:39.750 --> 33:41.333
( inhales deeply )

33:41.375 --> 33:43.500
Okay, I'm finished.

33:43.542 --> 33:45.125
You sure?
I think so.

33:45.166 --> 33:47.208
Feel better?
Kind of.

33:56.458 --> 33:59.875
You wanna know why Sam
quit surgery 12 years ago?

34:01.375 --> 34:03.750
He let a pedophile die
on his table.

34:03.792 --> 34:06.041
What? I--

34:06.083 --> 34:07.583
He made a decision

34:07.625 --> 34:09.583
and it's been eating away
at him ever since.

34:09.625 --> 34:13.458
And seeing Troy Hagen, it just
brought it all back for him.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.250
Nai, I know you're mad at me.

34:16.291 --> 34:18.083
I know that we are--

34:19.709 --> 34:20.792
I can't help him.

34:22.667 --> 34:24.083
He needs you.

34:29.083 --> 34:31.083
( indistinct chatter )

34:39.083 --> 34:42.458
I see it on your face when
you're here. You feel it.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.375
That thing.
The reason we help people.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.917
That girl would have died
on your table.

34:46.959 --> 34:48.667
Maybe. Maybe not.

34:48.709 --> 34:51.250
But now everything I've built,
they're gonna take it away.

34:51.291 --> 34:52.542
Because you went too far.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.750
You disappoint me.

34:58.792 --> 35:00.041
I've got nothing
to prove to you.

35:00.083 --> 35:01.834
And if I hear
about another clinic,

35:01.875 --> 35:03.667
if I find out that you treat
another patient,

35:03.709 --> 35:06.250
I will personally call the cops
and shut you down.

35:06.291 --> 35:08.291
( dramatic theme playing )

35:18.792 --> 35:20.500
Sam.

35:20.542 --> 35:22.083
Hey.

35:22.125 --> 35:24.542
I talked to Addison.
She told me.

35:24.583 --> 35:27.458
She told you what?
I know what happened.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.667
Hmm?

35:29.709 --> 35:31.291
I know.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.333
( exhales )

35:36.375 --> 35:39.208
Sam.

35:40.625 --> 35:41.875
Sam. Look at me.

35:41.917 --> 35:43.750
I am.
Please, just look at me.

35:43.792 --> 35:46.125
I am.

35:46.166 --> 35:48.667
I understand.
No, you can't.

35:48.709 --> 35:50.333
No, Sam, I do.

35:50.375 --> 35:51.709
But you should've told me.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.792
Because after that,
everything changed.

35:54.834 --> 35:57.583
Maybe not all at once, but--

35:57.625 --> 35:59.542
But just enough.

35:59.583 --> 36:02.000
Yeah.

36:04.083 --> 36:05.083
( inhales deeply )

36:05.125 --> 36:06.959
Well, I'm sorry. Ahem.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.041
( voice breaking ):
I know.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.959
I don't know
if that matters anymore.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.208
Oh, it matters.

36:12.250 --> 36:15.041
It matters to have someone
to listen to you

36:15.083 --> 36:18.959
and try to understand.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.208
It matters.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.166
Sorry.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.417
( door closes )

36:37.917 --> 36:41.500
You okay?
Yeah.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.792
VIOLET:
You miss it.

36:44.834 --> 36:47.625
Doctors Without Borders.

36:47.667 --> 36:49.000
The adrenaline.

36:51.250 --> 36:54.250
Yeah.

36:54.291 --> 36:56.750
Listen, I've been thinking
about trying to pick up

36:56.792 --> 36:58.250
some emergency-room shifts.

36:58.291 --> 36:59.667
Get back to critical care.

36:59.709 --> 37:05.000
If we can make it work
with your schedule and Lucas.

37:05.041 --> 37:06.375
We'll make it work.

37:25.208 --> 37:28.458
I know you don't wanna hear
an apology.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.834
No. I don't.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.667
Whatever I say--

37:33.709 --> 37:34.959
It's not gonna change anything.

37:38.750 --> 37:39.750
Have the surgery.

37:41.291 --> 37:43.709
Live.

37:46.166 --> 37:48.041
And do better next time.

37:48.083 --> 37:50.000
What, that's it?

37:52.667 --> 37:55.083
That's all any of us can do.

37:57.083 --> 37:58.333
( sighs )

37:58.375 --> 38:01.500
Should I be worried about
what just happened in there?

38:01.542 --> 38:04.041
Hagen's gonna have
the surgery.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.083
Thank you.

38:06.125 --> 38:08.834
Oh, uh...

38:08.875 --> 38:11.041
Tell Campbell to take another
look at the films.

38:11.083 --> 38:13.208
The patient has
a pseudo-aneurysm.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.542
If Campbell didn't see it,

38:15.583 --> 38:17.166
Hagen would have died
on the table.

38:30.750 --> 38:33.542
Hey.
You got a busy day tomorrow?

38:33.583 --> 38:35.166
Not really.

38:35.208 --> 38:39.583
Good. Because I had the realtor
set up some appointments, so...

38:39.625 --> 38:42.041
Why? You tattled to Violet
about our fight

38:42.083 --> 38:43.291
and she told you
to make nice?

38:43.333 --> 38:45.041
No.

38:45.083 --> 38:49.000
If you're unhappy here,
we'll move.

38:50.375 --> 38:52.041
But the truth is,
I don't see what you see.

38:52.083 --> 38:54.041
Every time I walk through
that door with you,

38:54.083 --> 38:56.542
I remember the first time
I brought you here

38:56.583 --> 38:57.959
and how excited I was.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.834
And the bedroom, it doesn't
remind me of makeup casseroles

39:00.875 --> 39:02.625
and catsuit tug of wars.

39:02.667 --> 39:06.000
It reminds me
of the first time we had sex.

39:06.041 --> 39:09.583
And for me,
now that you're here,

39:09.625 --> 39:13.542
everything just feels right.

39:13.583 --> 39:17.083
( soft rock music playing )

39:17.125 --> 39:19.750
How about we make a new memory?

39:19.792 --> 39:23.041
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.

39:23.083 --> 39:24.792
Mm-hm.

39:35.041 --> 39:36.709
Hey.

39:38.917 --> 39:41.959
So Sam convinced Hagen
to have the surgery.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.667
I heard.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Thank you.
I'm gonna be out of the office

39:47.041 --> 39:48.834
for a few weeks
on foundation business.

39:48.875 --> 39:52.166
Can, uh, can you ask Sam
to check in

39:52.208 --> 39:54.041
on Maya and Olivia for me
while I'm gone?

39:54.083 --> 39:56.250
Sure.
Okay.

39:58.834 --> 40:03.750
Nai, are we ever gonna be
friends the way we were?

40:05.500 --> 40:08.375
You know that night,

40:08.417 --> 40:11.041
the night he quit surgery?

40:11.083 --> 40:12.458
He didn't tell me
what happened.

40:12.500 --> 40:16.417
We had never had secrets
before that.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.959
That was the beginning
of the end of us.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.000
I'm sorry.

40:24.041 --> 40:26.709
Take care of him.

40:32.166 --> 40:35.083
Addie.
Yeah?

40:36.750 --> 40:39.333
This isn't the beginning
of the end of you and me.

40:55.750 --> 40:58.291
Hey.

40:58.333 --> 41:00.667
God, you're much later
than I thought.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.542
Yeah.

41:07.542 --> 41:09.000
I had a nice dinner
with Derek.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.208
That's good.
How did the surgery go?

41:16.333 --> 41:18.333
( sighs )

41:18.375 --> 41:21.959
I lost the patient.
Oh, Sam.

41:22.041 --> 41:24.333
I'm sorry.

41:24.375 --> 41:25.583
Come here.

41:25.625 --> 41:26.875
I'm okay.
I'm gonna go take a shower.

41:26.917 --> 41:29.917
Come here. Come here.

41:30.959 --> 41:32.500
( sighs )

41:32.542 --> 41:34.542
This wasn't your fault.
I know.

41:34.583 --> 41:36.792
Okay? You hear me?
Mm-hm.

41:36.834 --> 41:38.125
It was not your fault.

41:38.166 --> 41:40.041
( exhales )

41:41.250 --> 41:42.583
I'm sorry.

41:59.125 --> 42:01.917
Am I a good man?

42:11.083 --> 42:13.000
Yes.

42:28.250 --> 42:30.250
( upbeat theme playing )
