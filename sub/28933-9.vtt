WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:02.741
Previously onInstinct...

00:02.785 --> 00:05.309
So, you want to talk
about your little interview

00:05.353 --> 00:07.094
with the
Sleeping Beauty killer?

00:07.137 --> 00:10.358
Little?
It has 50,000 downloads already.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.969
I think the killer
may be someone you know.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.840
RYAN:
Check out the tent.

00:14.884 --> 00:15.972
Cowboy blanket.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.582
He brings his own

00:17.626 --> 00:20.716
blanket and pillow,
showcasing his signature.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.761
I have some news.Ryan's going back
to Nebraska.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.241
I think I should go with him.

00:24.285 --> 00:26.809
If MI6 thinks New York City's
first responder system

00:26.852 --> 00:28.376
is indeed at risk,

00:28.419 --> 00:31.292
why not go to the CIA?You're in danger.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.423
DYLAN:
Who in this
town does not

00:32.467 --> 00:33.729
seem affected by
restorative nostalgia?

00:33.772 --> 00:35.252
His own son,

00:35.296 --> 00:37.080
Cormac Rego.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.908
I can't believe we had him
and let him slip away.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.736
Okay, thanks, Fucci.He take off yet?

00:40.779 --> 00:42.955
Yeah, but not
to Mexico City.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.174
Back to New York?

00:46.220 --> 00:50.833
â™ª

00:50.876 --> 00:53.357
CORMAC: Hey, Mom.
Just landed in Mexico City.

00:53.401 --> 00:54.706
Which detective?

00:54.750 --> 00:56.882
Ryan?

00:56.926 --> 00:58.449
He stopped by?

00:58.493 --> 01:00.495
What did he say?

01:01.887 --> 01:04.412
And they left?

01:04.455 --> 01:07.806
[stammers] Do you know...
Are they still in Garfield?

01:07.850 --> 01:08.851
Okay, all right. Thanks.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.809
I got to go. Bye.

01:15.858 --> 01:18.643
Take the next exit.
I want to get out.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.737
There you go.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.130
Keep the change.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.044
Thanks.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.654
Have a nice night.

01:29.698 --> 01:31.961
[choking]

01:34.485 --> 01:37.227
[coughing, choking]

01:47.411 --> 01:49.065
JASMINE:
Everybody, listen up.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.286
This is Cormac Rego,
our Sleeping Beauty killer.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.418
Nice to finally put a
face to the nickname.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.812
We have Dylan and Ryan
to thank for that.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.596
Okay, so Rego's plane
touched down

01:58.640 --> 02:00.120
at JFK after midnight,

02:00.163 --> 02:01.599
and he slipped
through security.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.601
I don't think I need
to tell any of you,

02:03.645 --> 02:05.560
this is an
all-hands-on-deck situation.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.997
Welcome back.It's nice to be back.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.956
I'm sure you two didn't
get much sleep on your flight.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.784
Hope you're ready
for a manhunt.

02:12.828 --> 02:15.004
Can't wait.We've issued BOLO alerts

02:15.047 --> 02:16.658
to every precinct in the city,

02:16.701 --> 02:18.442
and nothing to any
of the media outlets.

02:18.486 --> 02:19.748
I want to keep
this contained.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.967
Rego's identity
won't be released.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.100
We'll play that card
if and when we need to.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.189
Okay, let's hear it.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.278
We've tracked bus terminals
and Grand Central.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.584
No one's seen him.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.151
We're tracking Rego's cell,
but he's still

02:31.194 --> 02:32.717
using a decentralized
router network.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.589
It's pinging towers in Vegas
one minute, Taiwan the next.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.243
Where the hell is Jules?

02:36.286 --> 02:38.201
I know he's cyber security,
but we could use him on this.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.377
I've reached out to him a couple
times. Haven't heard back.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.813
JASMINE:
Credit cards?

02:41.857 --> 02:43.424
FUCCI: Yeah, we're tracking
those, too, but he hasn't

02:43.467 --> 02:44.773
used them since he landed.

02:44.816 --> 02:47.254
Any info on how
Rego left JFK?Nothing yet.

02:47.297 --> 02:49.386
Let's push airport security
on surveillance footage.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.605
And see if any reports of

02:50.648 --> 02:51.910
violent incidents around JFK
have come in

02:51.954 --> 02:53.216
since the last time we checked.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.609
You mean five minutes ago?

02:54.652 --> 02:55.871
JASMINE:
Go get this son of a bitch.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.569
Lizzie. I want you partnering

02:58.613 --> 02:59.918
with Dylan
and Ryan on this.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.703
Sure.[phone buzzes]

03:01.746 --> 03:03.400
Sorry.

03:03.444 --> 03:05.185
Well, if you need to get that.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.664
No. It's my sister.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.231
She wants to talk
about God knows what.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.624
If I answer,
it'll take me an hour

03:09.667 --> 03:10.886
to get her off
the phone.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.844
Get caught up.

03:12.888 --> 03:16.544
So Rego kills his own father
in an office

03:16.587 --> 03:20.548
in Nebraska, bludgeoning him
with some kind of... award?

03:20.591 --> 03:21.984
Cormac then covered up
his dad's body

03:22.027 --> 03:23.420
in an act of killer's remorse.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.640
DYLAN:
What we don't know
is why he killed his father.

03:25.683 --> 03:28.033
Was it motivated by jealousy?
Greed? Hate?

03:28.077 --> 03:29.296
Were they a troubled family?

03:29.339 --> 03:30.645
RYAN:
No. The Regos were

03:30.688 --> 03:32.690
the family that everyone
wanted to be a part of.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.344
They had everything:

03:34.388 --> 03:37.434
big house, town's love.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.566
Cormac and Candace,

03:38.609 --> 03:40.263
they always seemed
to be so happy.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.743
They were the...

03:41.786 --> 03:43.745
the First Family of Garfield.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.790
Until Mr. Rego closed down
the factory.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.357
Candace?

03:47.401 --> 03:49.403
Cormac's sister.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.100
She still lives in Garfield,
two years older.

03:51.143 --> 03:53.711
She teaches
elementary school.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.278
She and Ryan used to date.Okay.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.801
I'm not sure
how that's relevant.

03:56.845 --> 03:57.933
And Cormac never

03:57.976 --> 03:59.195
got in trouble?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.980
No. He was a nice kid.
Everybody loved him.

04:02.024 --> 04:04.592
Whatever mental instability
he now possesses, he manages

04:04.635 --> 04:07.856
to mask convincingly with
socially acceptable behavior.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.988
So he was never a suspect.He alibied out.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.295
Not to mention,
half of Garfield had motive.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.297
A Livery cabdriver
with a JFK pickup

04:14.341 --> 04:16.517
was strangled
30 minutes after Rego landed.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.301
He's at New York Hospital.You go.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.911
I'll stay here
and call the sister.

04:19.955 --> 04:22.523
I want to work out why Cormac
would murder his own father.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.568
LIZZIE:
Got it.

04:31.836 --> 04:34.317
That call between
Rego and his mom

04:34.361 --> 04:36.014
must have been
what spooked him.

04:36.058 --> 04:38.756
He realizes he's been found out,
hangs up, and his M.O. changes.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.323
Along with the result.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.412
Only vic yet
to not wind up dead.

04:42.456 --> 04:45.285
But Rego thinks the cabbie is
dead, jumps out and disappears.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.678
Before his destination,
Canal and Division.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.289
Guess where we're going.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.813
Okay.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.858
Thank you, Candace.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.558
I know you're busy.

04:57.601 --> 04:58.689
Ah.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.909
You are the perfect
distraction.

05:00.952 --> 05:03.433
I was on my way to the
bar, and I figured

05:03.477 --> 05:04.695
you could use some
fresh clothes.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.306
I know wearing
the same suit

05:06.349 --> 05:08.351
two days in a row is
against your religion.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.179
It should be against
anyone's religion.

05:10.222 --> 05:11.398
Thank you.

05:11.441 --> 05:14.488
Also, um, your dad
came by today.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.620
My dad came by?

05:16.664 --> 05:18.535
My dad doesn't just come by.

05:18.579 --> 05:19.797
Did he look ill?

05:19.841 --> 05:21.625
Well, I was concerned, too,
but, you know,

05:21.669 --> 05:23.323
he looked his version of normal.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.976
Solid, serious,
a little scary.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.761
He wants to talk to you
in person.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.589
Why does that alarm me?

05:28.632 --> 05:30.286
I reminded him
you were on

05:30.330 --> 05:32.288
an important case.
He said he'd call.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.508
So, you have that
to distract you from catching

05:34.551 --> 05:35.509
a serial killer.[laughs]

05:35.552 --> 05:36.684
All right.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.338
I got to get back to
the bar. Trade you?

05:39.730 --> 05:41.732
Do me a favor,
will you?

05:41.776 --> 05:43.255
Come home safe.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.303
See you.

05:51.699 --> 05:52.874
[clears throat]

05:52.917 --> 05:54.658
Canal and Division.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.791
Only a couple of hundred
apartments to choose from.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.401
This should be easy.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.360
Well, this whole thing
should be over.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.013
You gonna keep blaming yourself?

06:02.057 --> 06:03.841
You got someone
else I can blame?

06:03.885 --> 06:05.800
You sleep at all?

06:05.843 --> 06:08.019
Not much.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.891
Eat anything?Not really.

06:09.934 --> 06:12.372
Want me to stop
asking you questions?

06:12.415 --> 06:13.460
Yep.

06:13.503 --> 06:14.722
Okay.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.684
Hey.
Hey.

06:20.728 --> 06:21.772
Hey.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.513
So where should we start?

06:23.557 --> 06:25.036
RYAN: Well, serial
killers tend to, uh,

06:25.080 --> 06:26.821
prefer living
on the ground floor.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.475
Since most of them
are antisocial,

06:28.518 --> 06:30.651
it allows them to avoid
riding elevators

06:30.694 --> 06:32.043
and interact with people.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.784
Dylan teach you that?

06:33.828 --> 06:35.743
We were on two flights together,
with no Wi-Fi.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.484
RYAN: Did you get
a hold of Candace?

06:37.527 --> 06:39.137
Yeah. She's devastated.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.879
She said Mr. Rego told Cormac
he had have to move to Mexico.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.533
Where Rego relocated
the business.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.535
When was this?Just a few days

06:45.579 --> 06:46.884
before Mr. Rego
was found dead.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.626
Then after the funeral,
Cormac moves down there.

06:49.670 --> 06:53.369
So he kills his father, flies to
Mexico City and then comes here.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.632
But the Regos
think he's still down there.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.286
What else?Nothing.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.549
She broke down.
She-she couldn't talk anymore.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.812
So, in the past
eight weeks,

07:01.856 --> 07:04.554
17 apartments sold
or rented around here,

07:04.598 --> 07:06.861
only one was
a cash transaction.

07:06.904 --> 07:09.603
Let me guess,
it's on the ground floor.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.525
â™ª

07:23.355 --> 07:24.922
[clicking, scratching]

07:24.966 --> 07:26.794
[whispering]:
What the hell is that?

07:26.837 --> 07:28.839
Someone's in there.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.415
[cat meows]

08:00.567 --> 08:02.090
RYAN:
The cowboy blankets.

08:03.744 --> 08:07.008
Hey. He won't have these
to cover any more victims.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.792
Maybe now he'll stop.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.881
Or change his M.O.

08:14.668 --> 08:15.843
Murder weapon.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.932
LIZZIE: You're going to
want to see this.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.155
[gasps]

08:24.199 --> 08:27.811
DYLAN: Looks like killer's
remorse has matured into

08:27.855 --> 08:29.639
killer's pride.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.641
Birth of a serial killer.

08:31.685 --> 08:35.123
I'd say he'd reached
the adult stage.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.479
What?

08:43.523 --> 08:44.872
Me and Ryan,

08:44.915 --> 08:48.963
the night we found the phone
of Rego's third victim.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.707
RYAN:
Hey, guys.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.189
I found this children's book
with kid's handwriting.

08:58.233 --> 09:01.889
"Mac, me and you,

09:01.932 --> 09:04.021
and you and me.

09:04.065 --> 09:06.937
Always, Candace."

09:06.981 --> 09:09.940
He kept that book,
from his sister.

09:09.984 --> 09:12.421
Even now, he kept it.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.683
That suggests

09:13.727 --> 09:15.119
he still does have a heart.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.599
Let's exploit it.

09:16.643 --> 09:17.687
Candace?

09:17.731 --> 09:19.210
Their relationship.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.821
DYLAN: She can
draw him out.

09:20.864 --> 09:23.214
She said she'll do anything
to keep her brother alive.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.216
I don't want cause this family
any more pain.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.088
Like another body dropping?

09:28.219 --> 09:29.699
Let's get Candace on a plane.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.662
â™ª

09:55.812 --> 09:58.815
You okay?

09:58.859 --> 10:00.643
No.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.949
I'm sorry.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.951
That was the stupidest question
I've ever asked.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.996
[laughs, sniffles]

10:13.700 --> 10:15.179
DYLAN: Candace.
Thanks for coming.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.485
This is Detective Needham.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.008
Hi. You can
call me Lizzie.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.054
Nice to meet you.DYLAN: Let's find
somewhere to sit.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.751
You must be exhausted.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.013
CANDACE:
Since we were little,

10:23.057 --> 10:24.624
Dad told Cormac,
one day,

10:24.667 --> 10:26.756
he'd take over the
family business.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.019
But that was the last
thing that Mac wanted.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.892
He talked about
moving to New York

10:31.935 --> 10:34.155
or sailing around
the world. [chuckles]

10:34.198 --> 10:35.983
And how about when
your father announced

10:36.026 --> 10:37.724
that he was shutting
down the factory

10:37.767 --> 10:39.116
and moving the business
to Mexico City?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.683
That's when he told Mac
he'd be going down there

10:40.727 --> 10:42.119
to get things up and running.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.556
Did Cormac tell your father
he didn't want to go?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.428
Of course not.

10:46.471 --> 10:50.693
Our father was
charming and admired,

10:50.737 --> 10:55.176
but behind closed
doors, he was...

10:55.219 --> 10:56.786
an angry man.

10:56.830 --> 10:57.787
Abusive?

10:57.831 --> 11:00.355
He was hard on my brother.

11:04.315 --> 11:06.622
Is this familiar?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.190
Cormac had that
when we were little.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.192
Where'd you find it?

11:11.235 --> 11:13.368
He's been using similar ones
to cover his victims.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.805
DYLAN: We think this blanket
may represent comfort to him,

11:15.849 --> 11:20.157
the way he comforted his victims
after their pain.

11:20.201 --> 11:24.118
It connects Cormac
to some remaining shred of love

11:24.161 --> 11:26.381
he once had, most likely
for someone special.

11:26.424 --> 11:29.732
Um...

11:29.776 --> 11:34.345
There was one night,
dead of winter,

11:34.389 --> 11:37.784
and Cormac wet the bed.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.438
Dad stormed upstairs
and ripped the sheets off,

11:40.482 --> 11:43.659
and grabbed Mac and threw him
out of the house.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.575
"Till you grow the hell up,
you sleep outside.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.272
You man up."

11:48.316 --> 11:51.449
So, I snuck outside
with this blanket,

11:51.493 --> 11:54.191
but I couldn't find him.

11:54.235 --> 11:59.501
So I went to the dock,
and there he was, in our boat.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.677
We'd hide there
when Dad lost his temper.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.246
He was shivering, scared.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.813
So I put this
blanket over him,

12:06.856 --> 12:09.119
and I told him it
would be all right.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.904
Did you reach out
to your brother today?

12:10.947 --> 12:14.124
No. Dylan asked me not to.

12:14.168 --> 12:17.127
Likely would have gone
straight to voice mail, anyways.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.563
We've tried a few
times already.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.436
We think now is the time
for you to call Cormac,

12:21.479 --> 12:24.439
and if he doesn't answer,
to leave a message

12:24.482 --> 12:26.354
so he can hear your voice.

12:26.397 --> 12:27.703
Why?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.400
To connect with him.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.141
But what if he
wants to see me?

12:31.185 --> 12:33.665
Then we'll arrange a safe place
for you to meet.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.276
You want me to
help you trap him?

12:35.319 --> 12:36.843
Find him.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.714
In an environment
we can control

12:38.758 --> 12:40.281
so that we can make sure

12:40.324 --> 12:41.804
everyone is safe,
including Cormac.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.198
We'll be there, undercover.

12:44.241 --> 12:48.463
He trusts you more than...
more than anyone.

12:48.506 --> 12:51.161
RYAN:
Let's bring him in safe.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.872
Whenever you're ready.

13:09.353 --> 13:12.182
CORMAC [voice message]: Hey,
it's Cormac. Leave a message.

13:13.227 --> 13:14.881
Hey, Mac.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.972
Cormac's dad sounds like
a real piece of work.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.712
Yeah. Makes mine look like
he should've won

13:20.756 --> 13:22.192
Father of the Year.

13:25.456 --> 13:26.806
Have you heard from Julian?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.374
No. You?

13:32.333 --> 13:35.510
With me, he's a ghost,
but with you, that's weird.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.860
And we could use his help.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
But, yeah, you're right.
It's not like him.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.474
I'm gonna give him a call.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.306
HARRIS:
There's footage of Rego

13:49.350 --> 13:51.569
exiting at Bowling Green,
then heading east.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.833
Security cams eventually put him
in a department store.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.356
When did he leave?
Don't know.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.618
From there, the trail goes cold.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.576
Where are we with the sister?

14:00.578 --> 14:02.885
Cormac wants to meet.
He just texted.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.887
Candace? Where?

14:04.931 --> 14:09.022
Your favorite place?
Do you know where that is?

14:09.065 --> 14:11.894
Cormac and I came here a couple
times when we were little.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.722
There was this
neighborhood we loved.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.725
It had cobblestone streets,

14:16.768 --> 14:19.249
old buildings, piers.

14:19.293 --> 14:20.642
South Street Seaport.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.036
CANDACE: There were these
giant sailboats,

14:23.079 --> 14:25.908
and we would just sit there, and
we would pretend one was ours,

14:25.952 --> 14:27.736
and we'd talk about
where we'd sail to.

14:27.779 --> 14:30.521
This is a good thing, right?

14:30.565 --> 14:32.349
It's what you wanted?

14:32.393 --> 14:33.655
It's a very good thing.

14:33.698 --> 14:34.917
It's a terrible thing.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.832
A public place,
of which we have no control.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.442
If Cormac is in a manic state,

14:38.486 --> 14:40.183
there is a high
risk of violence.

14:40.227 --> 14:42.838
So, what are you saying-- we
don't take him up on his offer?Yes.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.405
We find a reason she can't go,

14:44.448 --> 14:45.797
then we have Candace
call him back,

14:45.841 --> 14:47.930
offering a location that
we choose and we control.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.497
JASMINE:
A guy who kills
three people

14:49.540 --> 14:51.847
doesn't strike me as a "sure,
whatever, dude" type of guy.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.501
And what if he gets suspicious?

14:53.544 --> 14:55.459
Still preferable.I know you love to think,

14:55.503 --> 14:56.896
but you're overthinking
this time.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.420
We know where he'll be.
We see him and we grab him.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.639
Or the plan doesn't work, and he
sees Candace can't be trusted.

15:01.683 --> 15:04.294
Which means we lose her
as a card to play,

15:04.338 --> 15:06.296
and he has nothing to lose.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.950
I'm not letting him slip
through my fingers again.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.083
This may not be the
opportunity we expected,

15:10.126 --> 15:12.085
but we have to seize it.

15:12.128 --> 15:15.697
You want me to tell Candace
what we're asking her to do?[sighs] No.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.308
I should do it.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.312
This is wrong.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.661
Oh, really?
That's how you feel?

15:23.705 --> 15:25.315
I hadn't noticed.You think it's the right move?

15:25.359 --> 15:27.535
I think it's the only move.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.971
We can't let him take charge.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.320
We can't do nothing.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.453
Actually, nothing is an option.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.716
I hate it when we disagree.

15:34.759 --> 15:37.501
Oh, please, you love it.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.811
â™ª

15:42.854 --> 15:44.856
[quiet chatter]

15:55.650 --> 15:57.478
How's it look?
Any sign of him?

15:57.521 --> 16:00.698
Perimeter's tight.
No visual yet on Rego.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.067
He's late.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.112
Cold feet?

16:23.156 --> 16:24.896
LIZZIE [over comm]:
Or maybe Dylan's right.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.551
He's onto us, watching.

16:27.595 --> 16:30.119
That photo.

16:30.163 --> 16:33.122
He lured us up to that roof,
and he was watching.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.471
Rego craves control.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.865
He may be looking to get
the upper hand here, too.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.521
We have any eyes
on nearby rooftops,

16:40.564 --> 16:41.870
uh, upper-floor windows?

16:41.913 --> 16:44.655
Check outside
the perimeter, too.

16:48.659 --> 16:51.010
He's on the roof.
My two o'clock.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.063
Stock, wait for backup!

17:01.107 --> 17:03.892
Zack, stay on Candace.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.905
â™ª

17:24.565 --> 17:27.046
Come on, Cormac.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.048
Just give yourself up.

17:29.091 --> 17:32.703
You brought Candace into this.
You set her up.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.488
You made this worse.

17:38.796 --> 17:42.670
Come on, just step out
with your hands up.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.889
I don't want to hurt you.

17:44.933 --> 17:48.023
Maybe you can fool her
that way, but not me.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.590
You want to shoot me.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.070
No, I don't.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.985
Prove it.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.858
[gunshot, Cormac grunts]

17:57.989 --> 18:00.818
â™ª

18:18.967 --> 18:20.534
MAN:
Hey!

18:20.577 --> 18:22.666
Hey, man, watch out.
Watch out.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.755
[indistinct chatter]

18:28.107 --> 18:30.631
Out of the way! Police! Move![crowd murmuring, gasping]

18:30.674 --> 18:32.937
Get out of the way!MAN: Hey!

18:32.981 --> 18:35.810
[panting]

18:35.853 --> 18:37.594
Nothing?

18:37.638 --> 18:39.857
Hit him in the arm.

18:44.558 --> 18:45.646
RYAN:
Blood.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.256
All right.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.885
You said you wouldn't hurt him.I tried to talk to him.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.148
He ran off.
You promised me.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.975
Your brother's out of control.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.673
You shot him.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.675
He is bleeding somewhere.
He could die.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.764
I know, which is why we need
to find him as soon as possible.

19:16.807 --> 19:17.895
So you can kill him this time?

19:17.939 --> 19:19.723
No way.

19:22.726 --> 19:23.684
Candace.

19:23.727 --> 19:26.208
I'm done.
With all of this.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.254
DYLAN:
Let her go.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.125
And lose the only
thing we've got?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.126
She won't go far.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.215
How do you know? Huh?

19:33.259 --> 19:35.870
What egghead theory are you
going to spit out at me

19:35.913 --> 19:37.872
that lets you predict another
human being's behavior?

19:37.915 --> 19:39.874
She left her bag.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.880
You okay if I talk to her?

19:45.923 --> 19:48.056
Yeah, whatever. I mean,

19:48.099 --> 19:50.754
it's not like it
can get any worse.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.674
You were right.

20:01.374 --> 20:06.205
Odds are you're either sitting
in gum or saliva.

20:06.248 --> 20:09.033
On par with how
things are going.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.731
I know Ryan is just
doing his job,

20:10.774 --> 20:13.081
but it doesn't make me want
to yell at him any less.

20:13.124 --> 20:16.737
I don't know how you're
not yelling at everyone.

20:16.780 --> 20:20.741
My sister Katie and I,
we have our issues,

20:20.784 --> 20:25.049
but if she were
wounded or in danger

20:25.093 --> 20:27.748
and I couldn't help...

20:27.791 --> 20:30.316
even if she'd done
something unforgivable,

20:30.359 --> 20:32.622
I'd be beside myself.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.103
Are you and your sister close?

20:35.146 --> 20:37.366
Not as close as we used to be.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.977
We don't really
speak much anymore.

20:40.021 --> 20:44.939
Cormac and I,
we always had each other.

20:44.982 --> 20:46.984
Even as adults.

20:47.028 --> 20:49.944
I still can't believe
he did this.

20:49.987 --> 20:52.816
What if he didn't?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.688
What if you guys are wrong?

20:56.690 --> 20:59.214
This is gonna be hard,
and I'm sorry about that,

20:59.258 --> 21:02.696
but these pictures may help you
figure out what you want to do.

21:08.876 --> 21:11.182
This is Nancy Lee.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.663
She was a chemist.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.796
She spent her summers
around Garfield

21:15.839 --> 21:18.102
and heard about your
father's murder.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.453
She was your brother's
first victim
[groans]

21:20.496 --> 21:22.019
here in New York.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.373
Jay Moseby was your brother's
second victim here.

21:27.416 --> 21:30.419
He was a bartender who saw
Cormac with Nancy Lee

21:30.463 --> 21:32.116
the night that
she was killed.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.335
He was engaged,

21:33.379 --> 21:34.858
and the wedding was
supposed to be...

21:34.902 --> 21:37.861
[stammers]
I don't want to see any more.

21:37.905 --> 21:40.168
You are also your
brother's victim.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.257
So is your mom.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.739
Candace, Cormac
killed three people,

21:45.782 --> 21:48.481
almost strangled an
innocent cabdriver,

21:48.524 --> 21:51.179
so no matter how
much you love him

21:51.222 --> 21:53.834
and how upset you
feel right now,

21:53.877 --> 21:56.271
you need to let
us do our job.

21:58.360 --> 22:03.104
You really want to help
your brother, help us.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.511
We hit a wall.

22:18.554 --> 22:21.731
Hospitals and, uh, urgent cares
haven't treated him.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.124
We're getting nothing
from the cameras.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.256
This is such a big city,
it's-it's so easy to hide.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.303
Not necessarily.
It's not just the cameras.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.393
Every cop in the city is looking
for him, and he knows it.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.047
All it takes
is one mistake.

22:33.090 --> 22:35.528
[scoffs] I should know.

22:35.571 --> 22:38.139
Well, technically,
you made two mistakes.

22:38.182 --> 22:40.228
You lost Rego in Garfield,
then you totally

22:40.271 --> 22:42.883
messed up today.This is a horrible pep talk.

22:44.232 --> 22:46.930
It was your instincts
that took us to Garfield.

22:46.974 --> 22:50.804
And if we hadn't gone there,
we might never have been able

22:50.847 --> 22:52.283
to I.D. Rego
as the killer.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.808
Now he's on the run, injured,
again, because of you.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.245
The only wall out there
is around Cormac Rego,

22:57.288 --> 22:58.899
and it is closing in.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.510
So stop feeling like
you've let everybody down,

23:01.554 --> 23:04.078
and show me some
of that Midwestern,

23:04.121 --> 23:06.907
steak-eating,
cornfield-loving,

23:06.950 --> 23:09.388
"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning"
optimism, okay?

23:10.824 --> 23:12.434
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.783
Okay. Thank you.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.219
And, you know,

23:15.263 --> 23:16.960
Nebraska isn't...

23:17.004 --> 23:18.266
Oklahoma.Yes.

23:18.309 --> 23:19.572
FUCCI: Yeah, so we're
pulling footage

23:19.615 --> 23:21.443
from within a one-mile
radius of the Seaport,

23:21.487 --> 23:22.966
so fingers crossed
and all that.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.012
We have to be careful.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.406
Cormac is a wounded animal,
possibly prone

23:27.449 --> 23:29.320
to impulsive aggression,
which can occur with

23:29.364 --> 23:31.366
or without provocation.FUCCI: Yeah, well,

23:31.410 --> 23:34.238
when I get eyes on Rego,
I won't lack for provocation.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.110
Provocation.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.851
Yeah, what? I use it wrong?

23:37.894 --> 23:39.505
Even if we had Candace
reach out to Rego again,

23:39.548 --> 23:40.854
he's not gonna trust us.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.291
We have to provoke
a response.

23:43.334 --> 23:46.381
What's the one sure way we could
connect with him in the past?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.383
Hmm?The suspense is killing me.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.037
Dennis Walker.Dennis Walker.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.517
FUCCI:
The weaselly podcaster?

23:51.560 --> 23:53.954
Well, it's not like he has
a direct line on the guy.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.564
He does, in a manner
of speaking.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.479
Ryan.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.481
I'm already on it.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.528
DYLAN: The podcast will
have a veil of anonymity.

24:02.571 --> 24:05.313
No one will mention Cormac's
name or yours, so it'll just be

24:05.356 --> 24:09.099
you talking to Cormac.And my 50,000 listeners.

24:11.667 --> 24:14.540
Yeah, I'll shut up. Yeah.

24:15.671 --> 24:18.326
We've been over
the verbal triggers

24:18.369 --> 24:20.371
and emotional buttons
to push

24:20.415 --> 24:22.330
that can help us
get Cormac in safely.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.375
But if you get into
any trouble...

24:24.419 --> 24:26.334
She won't.DYLAN: The primary goal

24:26.377 --> 24:28.336
is for Cormac to feel
the emotional toll

24:28.379 --> 24:30.338
this is taking on you
and your mom,

24:30.381 --> 24:32.340
and how much harder
it will be

24:32.383 --> 24:36.126
if you wind up
losing him, too.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.172
Maybe he'll turn
himself in

24:38.215 --> 24:42.132
or, at the very least,
he'll reach out to us.

24:42.176 --> 24:45.353
No, I don't know
if I can, uh...

24:45.396 --> 24:49.531
Just tell him the truth
and speak from the heart.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.490
You ready?

24:55.929 --> 25:00.324
I'm Dennis Walker,
and this is The Murder Diaries.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.588
Today we are joined
by a very special guest,

25:02.631 --> 25:06.156
a woman who believes
that she may be the sister

25:06.200 --> 25:08.158
of the Sleeping
Beauty killer.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.552
She's here to make
a public appeal to him.

25:10.596 --> 25:14.425
To... to you.

25:14.469 --> 25:19.169
Hey. Hi. Um...
[clears throat]

25:19.213 --> 25:21.041
It's me.

25:21.084 --> 25:25.045
What you're doing,
what you've done, it...

25:25.088 --> 25:27.961
it breaks my heart
because, um...

25:36.622 --> 25:38.319
Because I know you.

25:38.362 --> 25:42.062
I'm worried.
Please let me help you.

25:44.238 --> 25:45.587
Just...

25:45.631 --> 25:47.589
turn yourself in, Co...

25:51.506 --> 25:53.508
I'll be here when you do.

25:53.552 --> 25:57.468
"Me and you,
and you and me."

25:58.513 --> 26:00.254
[clears throat]

26:00.297 --> 26:03.039
This has been The Murder Diaries.

26:03.083 --> 26:06.086
I'm Dennis Walker.
Until next time.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.523
We're out.
You want me to upload it?

26:08.567 --> 26:11.657
Yeah. Sounded
good to me.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.312
It's out there.

26:17.053 --> 26:18.707
CANDACE [over podcast]:
It's me.

26:18.751 --> 26:22.406
What you're doing,
what you've done, it...

26:22.450 --> 26:26.106
it breaks my heart.
Because, uh...

26:26.149 --> 26:28.456
because I know you.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.501
I'm worried.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.984
Please let me help you.

26:35.028 --> 26:38.684
Just... turn yourself in, Co...

26:38.727 --> 26:41.643
I'll be here when you do.

26:41.687 --> 26:45.560
"Me and you, and you and me."

26:45.604 --> 26:49.172
RYAN: How is it still personal
to Cormac if Mr. Rego is dead?

26:49.216 --> 26:52.436
I think Cormac blames you for
not being able to start over.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.438
I was just being a cop.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.310
You probably remind him
of what he couldn't be,

26:56.353 --> 26:59.008
the perfect son
for his monstrous father.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.575
[chuckles]
That's comforting.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.316
So now he wants
to kill me?

27:02.359 --> 27:04.535
It's entirely possible.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.581
[cell phones chime]

27:06.625 --> 27:08.757
An alert from
Dennis Walker. "The Murder Diaries:

27:08.801 --> 27:11.281
"Face-to-face interview with
the Sleeping Beauty killer,

27:11.325 --> 27:12.631
20 minutes"?

27:12.674 --> 27:14.807
Walker went rogue.

27:14.850 --> 27:17.374
Tell me how it's possible
I've got dozens of cops

27:17.418 --> 27:18.854
scouring the city
for this killer,

27:18.898 --> 27:21.074
and this podcast punk
is gonna be hooking up with Rego

27:21.117 --> 27:22.292
like they met on Tinder.

27:22.336 --> 27:24.643
Uh, he knows a good story
when he sees one.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.209
I've got a good story
to tell, too.

27:26.253 --> 27:27.558
We're releasing
Rego's name and photo.

27:27.602 --> 27:29.691
We're going wide.We got Candace to cooperate

27:29.735 --> 27:31.650
by promising that
we would not I.D. him.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.174
We? I didn't promise anything.

27:34.217 --> 27:36.350
He tried to kill that cabdriver.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.178
If he is attacking
people he perceives

27:38.221 --> 27:40.049
as threats, what's he
gonna do when he feels

27:40.093 --> 27:41.485
there are threats
everywhere he looks?

27:41.529 --> 27:43.487
We've got ten million
New Yorkers on the streets.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.619
Let's put them to work.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.186
He may change his M.O. again

27:46.229 --> 27:48.188
if he feels there's
nothing to lose.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.581
Keeping his identification
secret has gotten us nowhere.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.453
It's time we change our M.O.

28:00.156 --> 28:01.462
Everyone and their mother
thinks they've seen Rego.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.333
All we need is
one of them to be right.

28:03.377 --> 28:05.466
The mayor wants Dennis Walker's
face out there, too.

28:05.509 --> 28:08.208
Well, this guy's about to become
the most famous podcaster

28:08.251 --> 28:11.733
since, uh...
Are there famous podcasters?

28:11.777 --> 28:14.605
JASMINE:
Jules, you made it.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.738
Good to see you.

28:16.782 --> 28:17.957
Sorry about the delay.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.523
A delayed Jules is
better than no Jules.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.743
You seem to be an I.T. guy
with more than

28:21.787 --> 28:23.223
a few tricks
up your sleeve.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.833
What seems to be the issue?

28:24.877 --> 28:27.227
Public intel is pouring in,
zillions of photos, videos...

28:27.270 --> 28:29.795
You can only sift through
so many clips at a time.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.405
And there are
literally hundreds.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.799
Happy to help.

28:33.842 --> 28:37.106
Now, I can use image
recognition tools

28:37.150 --> 28:39.761
to look for key identifiers--
should narrow down

28:39.805 --> 28:41.676
these false hits
considerably.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.765
JASMINE:
How goes the tip line?

28:43.809 --> 28:45.419
HARRIS:
Doing our best to slog

28:45.462 --> 28:47.116
through the flood of calls.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.423
Yeah, half of which come
courtesy of John Q. Nut Job.

28:49.466 --> 28:51.512
Keep slogging.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.644
Rego sent me a video.

28:59.302 --> 29:00.695
DENNIS [on video]:
This is Dennis Walker.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.133
This is The Murder Diaries.

29:04.177 --> 29:06.266
I'm here with-with Cormac Rego.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.616
CORMAC [on video]:
Say it.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.836
Sleeping Beauty killer.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.620
CORMAC:
Video's new for you, isn't it?

29:12.663 --> 29:14.665
You think your fans will object?DENNIS: I don't know.

29:14.709 --> 29:15.884
I don't think so.

29:15.928 --> 29:18.539
Looks like he's holed up
in some crap motel.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.584
How did you get here, Dennis?

29:20.628 --> 29:24.240
You... you called me.
Said I could interview you.

29:24.284 --> 29:25.894
It's the perfect ending
to our story.

29:25.938 --> 29:28.288
Even with a bum arm
and on the run

29:28.331 --> 29:31.595
from the entire NYPD, guy sure
puts on one hell of a show.

29:31.639 --> 29:32.945
False bravado.DENNIS: No...

29:32.988 --> 29:34.555
He knows the walls
are closing in.

29:34.598 --> 29:37.166
That's why he took a hostage.
Last line of defense.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.908
How's New York treating you,
Ryan? You still enjoying it?

29:39.952 --> 29:42.650
He looks pale, like he's
lost a lot of blood.

29:42.693 --> 29:45.305
CORMAC:
I once told you, "It's on."

29:45.348 --> 29:48.961
But now, just to be clear,
I'm saying,

29:49.004 --> 29:51.702
"Back off."

29:56.359 --> 29:58.797
Unless you want another body.CANDACE: Oh, my God.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.328
LIZZIE:
Wait, wait. Back up.

30:08.371 --> 30:11.766
Push in. There.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.942
That white blur
under the table.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.988
Looks like a bag, no?

30:16.031 --> 30:18.294
Yeah.

30:18.338 --> 30:20.383
Okay, um, now back it up again.

30:22.255 --> 30:23.517
That blue and red,

30:23.560 --> 30:25.693
isn't that the logo for
Gansevoort Pharmacy?

30:25.736 --> 30:28.391
Zack, call all the Gansevoort
Pharmacies in lower Manhattan.

30:28.435 --> 30:30.306
See if any of them filled
any motel deliveries

30:30.350 --> 30:31.699
in the last couple of hours

30:31.742 --> 30:33.483
for gauze, peroxide,
anything that could be used

30:33.527 --> 30:35.921
to patch a bullet wound.On it.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.966
I have a favor to ask.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.881
Anything.
You know that.

30:39.925 --> 30:43.363
If you bring him in...When we bring him in.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.539
Can I have a few minutes?

30:45.582 --> 30:47.715
Just to sit with him.

30:48.759 --> 30:51.023
Betadine, gauze,
needle and thread

30:51.066 --> 30:52.285
delivered to
an Avenue D motel

30:52.328 --> 30:54.026
90 minutes ago.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.380
â™ª

31:25.884 --> 31:28.147
LIZZIE:
Bullet fragments
in the sink.

31:28.190 --> 31:29.409
He was trying
to take it out himself.

31:29.452 --> 31:31.193
Blood.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.717
I hope it's just Rego's,
not Walker's.

31:33.761 --> 31:36.546
It's still wet.
They can't be gone long.

31:36.590 --> 31:39.506
Hey, I found blood leading
to an empty parking space.

31:39.549 --> 31:40.637
He has a car.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.291
Could be Walker's.I'll put out a BOLO.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.728
He could be anywhere. Especially
if he thinks it's almost over.

31:44.772 --> 31:46.295
He's losing blood.

31:46.339 --> 31:48.036
At this point, he must be
looking for somewhere to hide,

31:48.080 --> 31:49.864
somewhere safe.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.041
Remember Candace said they
used to go to their boat

31:53.085 --> 31:54.651
to hide from their father?

31:54.695 --> 31:56.088
No way he'd go back
to the Seaport.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.785
Where's the nearest boat access?

31:57.828 --> 31:59.482
Maritime Terminal.

32:01.136 --> 32:03.486
Holding a hostage
may not just be

32:03.530 --> 32:06.098
a last line of defense;
it may also be a lure.

32:06.141 --> 32:09.014
A lure for what?Not what. Him.

32:25.595 --> 32:26.901
LIZZIE:
Melissa Walker.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.122
The podcaster's wife?
Sister?

32:30.165 --> 32:32.820
Either way,
Rego's here.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.693
We're in Maritime
Terminal, slip six,

32:36.737 --> 32:37.912
looking for Rego.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.392
We believe he's armed
and has a hostage.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.611
Remember,
we want him alive.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.137
Split up.
Clear the decks.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.008
I'll go right.If you find him,

32:47.052 --> 32:49.141
get him talking
and give him room.

32:53.232 --> 32:55.234
â™ª

33:24.263 --> 33:26.265
â™ª

33:42.237 --> 33:43.499
RYAN [over comm]:
Guys.

33:43.543 --> 33:45.545
Lower deck, in the bow.

33:46.589 --> 33:47.677
I'm here.

33:47.721 --> 33:50.245
You got
no more room to run.

33:50.289 --> 33:52.465
How about we put
a stop to this?

33:52.508 --> 33:55.120
We need to get down there.Not yet.

33:55.163 --> 33:57.078
Ryan's got him isolated
and contained.

33:57.122 --> 33:58.210
If we move in on him,

33:58.253 --> 33:59.428
Rego may do
something drastic.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.823
How about we take
this step-by-step?

34:02.866 --> 34:04.955
Step-by-step?
Step one,

34:04.999 --> 34:06.087
let him go.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.480
Oh, you mean the only
leverage I have?

34:07.523 --> 34:08.611
Right.
Mac.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.483
This is between you and me.

34:10.526 --> 34:12.180
We don't need him.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.964
You just tell me.

34:14.008 --> 34:16.228
Okay? Tell me what I can do.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.186
Step one,
drop your gun.

34:18.230 --> 34:20.014
Don't you dare.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.190
He's trying to establish trust.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.410
He's going to get
himself killed.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.898
Now it's your turn.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.516
CORMAC:
Now what?

34:43.559 --> 34:47.302
Now we talk. Okay? Just us.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.956
You can't stop
lying to me.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.827
You think I don't know
that you have backup here?

34:50.871 --> 34:51.785
I'm not an idiot!

34:51.828 --> 34:53.265
Nobody is calling you an idiot.

34:53.308 --> 34:55.093
Okay, I cheated off you in bio.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.224
Remember?

34:56.268 --> 34:57.965
Anyone else comes out here,

34:58.008 --> 35:00.794
I'm killing Ryan Stock,

35:00.837 --> 35:03.275
the golden boy of Garfield.

35:03.318 --> 35:06.278
You're right.
We got eyes on you.

35:07.931 --> 35:09.803
You shoot me, they shoot you.

35:09.846 --> 35:12.849
You try and run,
they shoot you.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.764
But if you don't do
either of those things,

35:14.808 --> 35:16.114
then we have options.

35:18.072 --> 35:19.813
And I want to help.

35:20.857 --> 35:21.945
How?

35:21.989 --> 35:25.297
Establish rapport, connect.
Good.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.907
[door opens,
footsteps approaching]

35:26.950 --> 35:28.735
Sarge, we need more time.

35:28.778 --> 35:31.041
Not your call.Ryan's engaged with him.

35:31.085 --> 35:34.088
If Rego sees you move on him,
he will panic.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.350
RYAN:
Whatever went down with

35:35.394 --> 35:37.178
you and your dad,
I'm on your side, okay?

35:37.222 --> 35:41.226
Don't talk about him.
I don't want to talk about him.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.053
Then let's talk about your mom.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.796
Or Candace.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.494
She loves you.

35:48.537 --> 35:50.452
She always did.

35:51.888 --> 35:54.282
Like that time your dad
threw you out of the house.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.068
You were scared, and
she found you, right?

35:58.112 --> 36:00.114
You were shivering in the boat.

36:02.247 --> 36:05.337
Candace brought
you that blanket.

36:05.380 --> 36:08.166
She will always
be here for you.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.517
Mac, you know that.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.996
Even now.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.869
She won't, though.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.392
Because you...

36:20.047 --> 36:22.005
...turned her against me.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.356
[sniffles]

36:24.399 --> 36:26.923
You destroyed our bond!

36:26.967 --> 36:29.056
Stop crying, Cormac.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.406
What did you say?

36:31.450 --> 36:32.973
You heard me.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.192
Man up!

36:34.235 --> 36:36.063
You sorry son of a...

36:39.806 --> 36:41.982
[grunting and groaning]

36:42.025 --> 36:43.244
[groans]

36:43.288 --> 36:45.855
[panting]

36:46.421 --> 36:48.467
[grunts]

36:50.338 --> 36:52.906
[grunting]

36:52.949 --> 36:54.255
I got him, I got him.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.170
Give me a hand.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.563
[grunting, coughing]

36:57.606 --> 37:00.392
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.437
[whimpering]

37:04.961 --> 37:06.963
[indistinct radio chatter]

37:19.149 --> 37:21.151
[car doors closing]

37:45.959 --> 37:47.482
Time's up.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.574
The power of their
sibling bond

37:52.618 --> 37:54.272
is remarkable.

37:54.315 --> 37:55.577
Despite everything,

37:55.621 --> 37:58.493
nothing can break it.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.997
DYLAN:
I don't know how you do
it in the cornfields,

38:24.040 --> 38:25.215
but here in the city,

38:25.259 --> 38:27.348
we have a little thing
called "protocol."

38:27.392 --> 38:29.350
LIZZIE:
Here in the city,
we consider it

38:29.394 --> 38:32.353
a cardinal sin to ever
lose possession of this.

38:32.397 --> 38:33.963
[chuckles]

38:34.007 --> 38:35.965
Thanks.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.489
You did it.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.360
We did it.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.406
Mm, some of us didn't think
you could hack it here.

38:41.449 --> 38:42.624
Who?

38:42.668 --> 38:44.365
Me.
And me.

38:44.409 --> 38:47.063
No, actually
just her. [laughs]

38:49.152 --> 38:51.372
[clicks safety,
sets gun on table]

39:04.516 --> 39:06.344
I need to shower.

39:06.387 --> 39:07.475
Yeah, you do.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.172
I wasn't going
to say anything.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.087
Thanks.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.307
Well done, you two.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.178
You made me
proud today.

39:16.571 --> 39:18.617
I'm going home to bed.

39:20.096 --> 39:22.185
Don't let it
get to your head.
Hmm.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.404
Too late.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.232
You happy to have me back

39:25.275 --> 39:27.103
from my Nebraska
adventure?

39:27.147 --> 39:28.409
We'll see.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.498
I'm happy, too.

39:31.978 --> 39:33.936
Want to go?

39:33.980 --> 39:35.547
No, I have something
I need to do.

39:35.590 --> 39:36.722
Okay.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.985
See you tomorrow.

39:51.563 --> 39:54.957
Katie, hey.
It's me, your big sis.

39:55.001 --> 39:56.394
Can you talk?

40:12.453 --> 40:15.413
That is quite a day.
You want a drink?

40:15.456 --> 40:18.677
No. I just want to go to bed.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.635
Your dad's here.

40:23.551 --> 40:26.032
I'll just put a
straw in the bottle.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.176
Dad.
Dylan.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.526
Good to see you.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.658
You, too. Everything okay?

40:43.702 --> 40:45.486
I should be asking you that.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.445
Heard you've had quite the day.

40:47.488 --> 40:49.229
Yes.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.318
Thankfully, it's over.

40:56.192 --> 41:00.327
I know we're not about to win
any father-son awards, and...

41:00.370 --> 41:04.157
maybe you weren't the most
compassionate of fathers.

41:04.200 --> 41:08.509
And maybe I wasn't
the easiest child to parent.

41:08.553 --> 41:10.163
[chuckles]

41:10.206 --> 41:12.513
Being deputy director of the CIA

41:12.557 --> 41:15.473
is a walk in the park
by comparison.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.605
But I know you care about me.

41:19.564 --> 41:21.827
And... much as
you may have disagreed,

41:21.870 --> 41:25.700
you've let me live my life,
so...

41:25.744 --> 41:27.354
thank you.

41:27.397 --> 41:30.139
You're welcome.

41:31.184 --> 41:33.360
You know...

41:33.403 --> 41:35.536
I've learned a lot from you.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.625
Still learning.

41:38.670 --> 41:40.672
But that's not why you're here.

41:40.715 --> 41:42.456
No.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.240
Your precinct's
had computer issues

41:44.284 --> 41:45.546
the last couple of months.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.374
I'm aware of that, yes.

41:47.417 --> 41:48.593
Then you're
obviously aware

41:48.636 --> 41:50.551
that Julian's been
working undercover,

41:50.595 --> 41:53.380
presumably fighting
off this cyberattack.

41:53.423 --> 41:55.600
Not loving the use
of "presumably."

41:55.643 --> 41:58.472
Chatter has it
that Julian Cousins

41:58.516 --> 42:01.083
has been planting that malware.

42:01.127 --> 42:03.564
That he's being
paid handsomely

42:03.608 --> 42:06.524
to compromise the city's
first responder network.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.308
You don't believe that.

42:09.657 --> 42:12.530
I wouldn't be
here otherwise.

42:12.573 --> 42:15.620
Julian is many things,
but he is not a traitor.

42:16.925 --> 42:18.448
He's a liar by trade.

42:18.492 --> 42:20.581
We all are.

42:20.625 --> 42:22.104
Were.

42:22.888 --> 42:24.498
Right.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.109
Anyhow...

42:27.153 --> 42:28.546
I thought you
should know.

42:28.589 --> 42:31.505
No, I'll let myself out.
