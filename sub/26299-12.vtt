-Chuck.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.172
Oh, Chuck.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.142
Oh, Joe,
so adorable,

16:15.175 --> 16:17.610
you look like
a little Uncle Alvaro!

16:17.644 --> 16:19.712
One last touch --
the pocket watch,

16:19.746 --> 16:21.281
permanently
broken at 3:30

16:21.314 --> 16:23.516
after it stopped a bullet shot
by a very drunk

16:23.550 --> 16:25.618
and jealous
Florence Nightingale.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.120
Jay:
Maybe it was sour grapes,

16:27.154 --> 16:30.557
but this guy was starting
to sound like baloney.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.160
I was sure that if I left
no stone unturned,

16:33.193 --> 16:35.162
eventually, one day,

16:35.195 --> 16:38.465
I'd find some dirt
on Great Uncle Alvaro.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.832
I knew it!

16:39.866 --> 16:44.471
SimÃ³n Francisco Alvaro
would go from town to town,

16:44.504 --> 16:46.373
seducing wealthy widows

16:46.406 --> 16:49.809
with made-up stories
of his bravery in battle.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.246
After frittering away their
fortunes on drink and dice,

16:53.280 --> 16:56.983
he would move on, leaving
his victims with nothing

16:57.016 --> 16:59.352
but a single red rose --

16:59.386 --> 17:00.653
and syphilis.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.156
Who's up for
a little history lesson?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.024
It seems --
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.826
Do it again.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.429
The yoke
of Spanish oppression

17:09.462 --> 17:12.999
will chafe Colombian
shoulders no longer!

17:13.032 --> 17:16.103
My saber thirsts
for European blood!

17:16.136 --> 17:18.405
So cute!
Bravo!

17:18.438 --> 17:21.841
He looked it up
and memorized it himself.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.776
Hey, Dad.
You know how kids tease me

17:23.810 --> 17:25.778
'cause I'm the shortest kid
in the class?

17:25.812 --> 17:27.414
Oh, don't listen
to what they say!

17:27.447 --> 17:31.084
Right! Uncle Alvaro was
only five feet tall

17:31.118 --> 17:33.186
and he led a whole army!

17:33.220 --> 17:35.555
I'm gonna be brave
like him.

17:36.823 --> 17:40.059
Viva Uncle Alvaro.

17:40.093 --> 17:43.363
Jay: I enjoyed a lot of years
taking pride in my great uncle.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.598
I didn't want
to rob Joe of that.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.534
It wasn't easy biting my tongue,

17:47.567 --> 17:50.470
but I took a page from
another heroic relative --

17:50.503 --> 17:52.639
Lulach McPritchett --

17:52.672 --> 17:56.042
proud Scottish warrior,
captured by the English,

17:56.075 --> 17:59.612
tortured for months
using every method imaginable,

17:59.646 --> 18:03.383
and never once giving up
a single secret.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.851
Don't look him up.

Let me see that
big macaroni smile, ah?

How did you
find me?

[ Normal voice ]
Antonio called and said

18:21.934 --> 18:23.770
you'd ordered
a flaming Sambuca...
[ Sighs ]

18:23.803 --> 18:25.405
...and just
watched it burn.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.840
Mm-hmm.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.476
It's all just
going too fast.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.077
Five months ago,

18:31.110 --> 18:32.579
Haley got back
together with Dylan.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.415
Then my mom dies.
Then Haley's pregnant.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.783
Then it's twins.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.419
Then, "Come move in with us
this summer" turns into

18:39.452 --> 18:42.255
"Ding-dong, we're here with
an early preview of twins

18:42.289 --> 18:43.823

and, in the most terrifying
return since Freddy Krueger

sashayed his way back
onto Elm Street,

handling this all so well?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.105
Who says I am?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.207
I had to get
out of there,

19:00.240 --> 19:03.009
or I was gonna make
Haley a single mom.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.811
I hit Dylan again,
Claire.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.447
But not on purpose.
Are we sure?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.116
You mean, like, you might
have some buried anger

19:10.149 --> 19:12.952
towards him stealing away
your baby girl?

19:12.985 --> 19:15.488
Oh, I so want it
to be on purpose.

we still have Italy.

Do we?

19:25.498 --> 19:27.900
Listen, I've been doing
some research on twins,

19:27.934 --> 19:30.637
and it seems that, like
our daughter, they --

19:30.670 --> 19:31.671
they tend
to come early.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.140
Even if it's
a 1-in-10 chance,

our best memories

19:48.120 --> 19:50.990

of our house?

19:51.023 --> 19:54.160

stuck in the banister?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.762
Which time?
[ Chuckles, snorts ]

19:55.795 --> 19:58.365

20:03.403 --> 20:04.837
Haley snuck in
Luke's window

20:04.871 --> 20:06.873
the same week we bought him
a slingshot?
Oh, God.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.675
That was...
Mm.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.843
So, it's
a-a madhouse,

we're gonna have a couple

Okay, Shoshana and I
are over.
