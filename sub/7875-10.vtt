WEBVTT

00:06.506 --> 00:08.940
I've had sex
with a lot of women.

00:09.042 --> 00:13.445
And let me tell you,
you... should probably get tested.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.242
He just left.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.206
Oh, yeah!
U.S.A. To the rescue!

00:46.312 --> 00:48.712
Smith, I don't need your help!

00:48.815 --> 00:53.343
Nobody needs America's help...
until they need it.

00:53.453 --> 00:56.115
# Still rock in America #

00:56.222 --> 00:59.589
- # Oh, yeah-##
- Dang, no tunes!

01:25.485 --> 01:27.453
Whoops.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.984
<i>Ah! What the hell?</i>

01:35.095 --> 01:39.293
Wait! You're a gun? I always thought you were,
like, an eyeball or something!

01:39.399 --> 01:41.299
Douche!

02:27.747 --> 02:30.944
- Morning, Peacenickel.
- Morning, government sanctioned murderer.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.177
Oh, Peacenickel.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.379
Why don't you shut up?
Is he in?

02:35.488 --> 02:38.116
<i>Smith, sit down.</i>

02:38.224 --> 02:41.421
This is Tchochkie Schmear,
a ruthless, international arms dealer...

02:41.528 --> 02:44.019
<i>who is now suddenly
producing movies.</i>

02:44.130 --> 02:48.533
<i>As we speak, he is shooting 20 films,
all with A-list celebrities.</i>

02:48.635 --> 02:52.298
But according to our intel,
they're absolutely atrocious.

02:52.405 --> 02:56.705
<i>- How bad can they really be?
- His latest film is Bark of the Covenant.</i>

02:56.809 --> 03:00.267
<i>It's a remake of Raiders
with a German Shepherd as Indiana Jones.</i>

03:00.380 --> 03:03.872
<i>It also stars Matthew McConaughey
as Karen Allen.</i>

03:03.983 --> 03:08.010
Clearly these horrible movies are a cover
for some diabolical scheme.

03:08.121 --> 03:11.022
<i>I don't know, sir.
Was Lady in the Water a cover for anything?</i>

03:11.124 --> 03:14.321
We need you to infiltrate
the set and find out what he's up to.

03:14.427 --> 03:16.861
- The world is at stake.
- Really?

03:16.963 --> 03:19.523
Could be.
You know who's gonna find out?

03:19.632 --> 03:22.226
- Me?
- Bingo.

03:22.335 --> 03:24.895
So, what new gadgets
have you got for me, S?

03:25.004 --> 03:30.101
Seems like an ordinary,
fancy gold pen, right? Turn the top.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.474
When that gas comes
in contact with a woman...

03:32.579 --> 03:34.479
it makes her breasts grow bigger.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.015
Don't you have anything
a little more... useful?

03:37.116 --> 03:39.880
Ah, right, right.
Perhaps you'll like this.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.079
Looks like an ordinary
cell phone, yes?

03:42.188 --> 03:45.521
Well, open it and press three.

03:45.625 --> 03:49.391
Yeah, see? If you were a woman,
you'd have some pretty big cans by now.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.499
Here's your coffee,
Mr. McConaughey.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.542
And thanks for hiring me
as your college intern, Mr. Schmear.

04:03.643 --> 04:07.044
Oh, um, Mr. Schmear, I'm writing
a paper on the history of cinema.

04:07.146 --> 04:10.343
And I was wondering, um, are you making
so many bad movies at once...

04:10.450 --> 04:13.044
as part of some evil plot
to dominate the world?

04:13.152 --> 04:15.143
And also, I need to
leave early on Friday...

04:15.255 --> 04:17.849
'cause my roommate's mother
is coming to take us out to dinner.

04:20.026 --> 04:22.893
What did you do?
Was there milk in that coffee?

04:22.996 --> 04:27.490
McConaughey can't have milk!

04:27.600 --> 04:29.295
Stop!

04:32.872 --> 04:35.363
Take my hand.

04:39.212 --> 04:42.045
This isn't McConaughey!
It's a robot!

04:43.549 --> 04:46.382
The robot McConaughey went haywire, sir.
He is kaput.

04:46.486 --> 04:49.284
Thank you, Tchochkie.

04:49.389 --> 04:53.917
Well, Professor, it appears your crappy robots
still malfunction when they drink milk.

04:54.027 --> 04:58.225
You're a lunatic with a madman's dream
of a milk-proof robot!

05:00.733 --> 05:04.863
Good-bye, Professor.
I'll weep for you.

05:10.076 --> 05:14.069
Yeah, that's ridiculous. The contractor
who built this place screwed me good.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.171
Gums, he's stuck
on the death slide.

05:18.384 --> 05:21.410
Okay, there we go.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.227
Mani, Pedi, dance for me!

05:29.329 --> 05:33.231
<i># Sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than #</i>

05:33.333 --> 05:35.927
<i># The tears of a clown #</i>

05:36.035 --> 05:38.003
<i># When there's no one around ##</i>

05:41.941 --> 05:43.841
Thank you for flying
out here, Smith.

05:43.943 --> 05:46.138
Of course, sir.
But why are we dressed up like this?

05:46.245 --> 05:49.908
<i>Because I thought
we could be secret Asians.</i>

05:50.016 --> 05:53.508
A 16-hour flight for a bad pun?

05:53.619 --> 05:56.110
Yes. Yes.

05:56.222 --> 05:59.885
So you think it was milk that
made the McConaughey robot go crazy?

05:59.992 --> 06:02.017
Yes. But more importantly,
where's the real McConaughey...

06:02.128 --> 06:04.096
and why was he replaced
with a robot?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.358
We're not sure.
What we do know is...

06:06.466 --> 06:09.492
that before McConaughey
agreed to do Tchochkie's film...

06:09.602 --> 06:12.503
he spent a week
at an exclusive celebrity spa...

06:12.605 --> 06:16.041
in the remote Teardrop Islands.

06:16.142 --> 06:19.236
Your mission is to go to the spa
and find out what's going on.

06:19.345 --> 06:23.042
The spa is owned by mysterious
business tycoon, Tearjerker.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.510
But, sir, how do I get
into the resort?

06:27.620 --> 06:31.784
Tearjerker's a notorious gambler
who's currently at the casino in Monte Carlo.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.657
Go challenge him to a game of chance
and win yourself an invitation.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.560
Oh. Looks like I've got a bite.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.807
What is your drink, sir?

06:51.911 --> 06:54.243
Beer. Shaken, not stirred.

06:57.216 --> 07:00.879
<i>Hey, handsome.
Got a light?</i>

07:02.255 --> 07:04.280
Looks like you got yourself
a cigarette there.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.585
I'm Sexpun T'Come.

07:06.692 --> 07:09.855
I get a good feeling from you.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.556
- Do you get a good feeling from-
- Are you a whore?

07:12.665 --> 07:14.758
I mean, it's cool if you're a whore.
But no right now.

07:14.867 --> 07:18.394
<i>- I don't get with no whore.
- Another martini for Tearjerker.</i>

07:21.874 --> 07:25.674
Good evening, Tearjerker.
Smith. Stan Smith.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.905
I didn't really ask
who you were, but okay.

07:28.014 --> 07:31.711
- I'd like an invitation to your spa.
- I only invite celebrities.

07:31.818 --> 07:35.447
Well, perhaps I can play you for an invitation.
Name your game.

07:35.555 --> 07:37.455
Okay. Baccarat.

07:37.557 --> 07:40.458
- Yeah, I don't know how to play that.
- Okay then. Craps.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.859
Yeah, I don't get that either.
I mean, seven's good. But then seven's not good.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.193
How do you play the horn?
Then they get mad at me-

07:46.299 --> 07:49.427
<i>Okay, okay.
Perhaps you should name your game.</i>

07:49.535 --> 07:52.971
But I must warn you!
I never lose.

07:53.072 --> 07:55.302
Okay. Let's play Highest Number.

07:55.408 --> 07:58.969
- I'm not familiar with it.
- Whoever says the highest number wins.

07:59.078 --> 08:01.444
- You go first.
- Thank you.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.412
Six thousand.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.507
Seventeen thousand.

08:05.618 --> 08:08.246
Well played.

08:08.354 --> 08:11.346
I guess I'll see you
on the Teardrop Islands.

08:11.457 --> 08:14.187
- Did you get it?
- Yes, baby.

08:14.293 --> 08:18.821
I trust you'll enjoy my spa,
Mr. Stan Smith of the C.I.A.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.764
In fact, you'll like it so much...

08:21.868 --> 08:23.995
you'll never leave.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.933
Oh, my God! You smell that?

08:29.041 --> 08:32.272
I had a pickle an hour ago.
Came with my Reuben.

08:32.378 --> 08:34.346
I'm so fat.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.422
I am a huge fan, Mr. Depp.
What are you reading there?

08:43.523 --> 08:46.117
A film I just signed on
to do with Spielberg.

08:46.225 --> 08:48.887
Your milk shake, Mr. Depp.

08:48.995 --> 08:52.226
Huh, milk shake.
So you're not a robot.

08:52.331 --> 08:55.061
- No.
- If you ever become a robot, will you tell me?

08:55.167 --> 08:57.135
Sure.

08:58.237 --> 09:00.137
<i>Nice.</i>

09:00.239 --> 09:02.969
<i>We're now beginning
our descent into the Teardrop Islands.</i>

09:03.075 --> 09:06.101
<i>Look at that. We're landing in his mouth.</i>

09:06.212 --> 09:08.407
<i>It's like he's eating us.
I bet we're delicious.</i>

09:08.514 --> 09:10.414
<i>I know you're delicious.</i>

09:11.717 --> 09:14.515
Mani, Pedi, Sexpun?

09:14.620 --> 09:17.088
I'm gonna need you guys
to go give our guests...

09:17.189 --> 09:20.420
<i>their " spa treatments. "</i>

09:22.261 --> 09:25.162
Oh, you can throw a knife.
But you know what you can't throw?

09:25.264 --> 09:29.132
A party... for my birthday...
which was Wednesday!

09:29.235 --> 09:31.999
I remembered yours!

09:32.104 --> 09:35.505
What is the fascination
with celebrity babies?

09:35.608 --> 09:38.236
There are so many more important things
going on in the world.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.244
Famine, war-Ahh.

09:40.346 --> 09:44.840
Sharon Stone's baby is afraid of her.
Just like the rest of us.

09:44.951 --> 09:47.545
Right this way, Mr. Depp.

09:47.653 --> 09:50.178
I'm gonna try and touch Gilbert's grapes.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.487
Hello again, Mr. Smith.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.090
Well, look what the whore cat
dragged in. A whore.

10:02.201 --> 10:06.035
No. I'm Tearjerker's
personal masseuse.

10:06.138 --> 10:09.835
And he asked me
to work on you myself.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.709
- Will you marry me?
- Wha-

10:16.816 --> 10:20.650
Look, I know where this is going,
but I'm saving myself for marriage.

10:20.753 --> 10:25.087
So before we have relations,
we have to sanctify our union in the eyes of God.

10:25.191 --> 10:28.524
Then I'm gonna make love to you
until you hate your vagina.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.687
My God, you're so sweet!
L- I-

10:30.796 --> 10:34.960
Here. Think about it. I'm gonna go hit
the juice bar. You probably wouldn't like it.

10:35.067 --> 10:38.400
It's not about living out childhood abuse
through degrading sexual encounters.

10:38.504 --> 10:40.699
It's more about juice.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.310
Johnny!
How's the Spielberg script?

10:46.412 --> 10:48.312
I'm not doing that film anymore.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.814
Tchochkie Schmear's
got a project that's way better.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.680
<i>Skateboarding Grandma.
Wait a second.</i>

10:53.786 --> 10:57.916
You're doing a crappy Tchochkie Schmear movie
instead of working with Spielberg?

10:58.024 --> 11:01.391
- Here. You want to try my milk shake?
- I hate milk shakes.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.122
Really? 'Cause on the plane you-
Open up!

11:04.230 --> 11:06.926
- Get off me, man.
- Come on. Drink it like a bird!

11:09.635 --> 11:12.468
You promised me you'd tell me
if you became a robot!

11:12.571 --> 11:15.802
You broke a pinky promise!

11:15.908 --> 11:18.138
I once found a robin's nest...

11:18.244 --> 11:21.907
in Tim Burton's hair-

11:36.462 --> 11:39.556
- Sexpun?
- Stan, Tearjerker only invited you here...

11:39.665 --> 11:41.565
because he wants to kill you.

11:41.667 --> 11:46.036
And I'm only telling you this because I...
think I'm falling for you.

11:46.138 --> 11:49.665
Ah. I remember when I first fell for me.
Great feeling, isn't it?

11:49.775 --> 11:53.973
Warm. Right in your belly.
Right there. That's me.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.379
<i>- Now tell me what Tearjerker's up to!
- I'll tell you.</i>

11:57.483 --> 12:01.886
All aboard Tearjerker's
Diabolical Plan Boat Tour.

12:03.322 --> 12:06.519
Let us make nautical haste!

12:07.727 --> 12:09.752
Tearjerker has spent years...

12:09.862 --> 12:13.889
replacing the world's
foremost thespians with robots.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.729
Why? So he could
make them perform...

12:16.836 --> 12:19.862
in the worst films imaginable.

12:19.972 --> 12:24.102
Some, like Sylvester Stallone,
already do that themselves...

12:24.210 --> 12:27.179
and hence,
are not made into robots.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.247
Now, stay with me here.

12:29.348 --> 12:34.342
Because the plan gets a little convoluted
and a lot crazy.

12:34.453 --> 12:38.856
With the robots making terrible films
that no one would want to see...

12:38.958 --> 12:40.858
the world will be forced to go see...

12:40.960 --> 12:44.327
Tearjerker's very own
cinematic masterpiece.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.991
This is all so Tearjerker
can get people to see a movie?

12:48.100 --> 12:51.263
Please hold your questions...

12:51.370 --> 12:54.203
until the end of the tour.

12:55.741 --> 12:57.732
Questions?

12:57.843 --> 13:01.142
The tour ends here?
I thought that was a lap pool.

13:03.549 --> 13:06.416
Mike, you ended
the boat tour in my office?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.749
Unacceptable.
Get over here and fix it!

13:08.854 --> 13:11.550
And don't send
your 20-year-old stoner son!

13:11.657 --> 13:15.115
I know because
I'm not an idiot, Michael!

13:15.227 --> 13:18.196
Look, I went through the same thing
with Lily, and she's at Yale now.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.994
Just talk to him.
And by talk, I really mean listen.

13:22.101 --> 13:25.070
And fix my damn lair,
you thieving bastard!

13:28.974 --> 13:32.068
Never hire a contractor
just because he's gorgeous.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.979
So you've heard most of my brilliant scheme.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.142
Now I bet you want to know
what drove me to this.

13:40.252 --> 13:43.278
- Not really. I just need to know-
- The year was 2002.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.448
The place, Hollywood.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.220
My dream was to make it
on the silver screen.

13:48.327 --> 13:52.024
<i>My first audition was for the lead
in a little movie called Monster's Ball.</i>

13:52.131 --> 13:57.228
Make me feel good. Make me feel good.

13:57.336 --> 14:01.329
Yeah, the producers laughed too.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.034
Laughed me out of that room
and out of that town!

14:04.143 --> 14:07.112
So I swore that one day
I'd make the whole world cry...

14:07.213 --> 14:09.943
by making the saddest film
of all time!

14:10.049 --> 14:12.544
Lights!

14:12.651 --> 14:16.382
<i>In a world torn apart by war and intolerance...</i>

14:16.488 --> 14:19.616
<i>one voice stood out.</i>

14:19.725 --> 14:21.716
<i>A voice that was strong.</i>

14:21.827 --> 14:23.954
<i>A voice that was inspiring.</i>

14:24.063 --> 14:28.625
<i>A voice that was
sometimes hard to understand.</i>

14:28.734 --> 14:31.396
I want to drive the truck!
I want to drive the truck!

14:31.503 --> 14:33.630
Oscar, no! Be quiet!

14:33.739 --> 14:37.300
Vroom-vroom! Vroom!
Vroom-vroom!

14:37.409 --> 14:40.742
<i>As if it wasn't enough that he was Jewish-</i>

14:40.846 --> 14:42.939
I am sorry to say...

14:43.048 --> 14:45.881
that your son
is mentally retarded.

14:45.985 --> 14:47.976
What does that mean, Doctor?

14:48.087 --> 14:51.648
It means he'll never
not be retarded.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.748
No!

14:53.859 --> 14:56.987
Oh, no! Why? Why us?

14:57.096 --> 15:02.159
<i>And as if it wasn't enough that
he was Jewish and mentally retarded-</i>

15:05.037 --> 15:07.733
Where is the wine?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.740
<i>He was an alcoholic.</i>

15:09.842 --> 15:12.276
Oscar, no!
You can't have that!

15:14.380 --> 15:16.610
I want more dizzy water!

15:24.123 --> 15:26.284
I want to play more, puppy!

15:26.392 --> 15:30.192
Oscar, I- I have
some bad news for you.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.764
Your puppy has cancer.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.001
<i>And it took the death ofhis best friend...</i>

15:37.102 --> 15:42.836
<i>to realize sometimes
strength comes to us all.</i>

15:48.247 --> 15:52.377
<i>This holiday season,
go for strength.</i>

15:52.484 --> 15:54.384
<i>Go for inspiration.</i>

15:54.486 --> 15:57.944
<i>Go for Oscar Gold.</i>

16:01.293 --> 16:05.195
- Wow. So sad.
- Really sad.

16:05.297 --> 16:09.199
Yes, it's sad. I'm glad you guys got that.
And that was just the trailer.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.861
Imagine seeing
the four-hour director's cut.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.668
People will cry so much
they'll cry themselves to death!

16:15.774 --> 16:20.177
- Tearjerker, that's impossible!
- Is it? Tell that to the critics' screening!

16:23.749 --> 16:26.513
The film is opening on
500,000 screens...

16:26.618 --> 16:29.086
all over the world
in just a few minutes.

16:29.188 --> 16:33.921
<i>With all the crap I'm releasing against it,
people will have no choice but to see Oscar Gold.</i>

16:34.026 --> 16:36.722
And... then... they...

16:36.829 --> 16:39.593
will... cry...

16:39.698 --> 16:42.690
and die.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.996
Pie? You can't have any.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.976
I'm away!

16:52.077 --> 16:54.944
Is there anything more terrifying
than a hovering blimp?

16:55.047 --> 16:57.413
Tearjerker, you can't do this.
You'll kill millions.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.144
Correction. Millions and two.

17:00.252 --> 17:03.415
<i>Because you will also
be viewing the film...</i>

17:03.522 --> 17:05.512
right after Coca-Cola's Movie Quiz.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.532
People worldwide
are already crying hysterically.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.969
Your fiendish plan
is working perfectly.

17:21.073 --> 17:25.567
Well, this is it. We're gonna cry to death!

17:25.676 --> 17:28.406
No, no! Don't hug him, Oscar!
He's Hermann Göring!

17:30.516 --> 17:32.416
- Stan?
- Yes, Sexpun?

17:32.518 --> 17:34.452
- My answer is yes.
- Yes to what?

17:34.553 --> 17:36.544
To your marriage proposal.

17:36.655 --> 17:40.284
If I die, I want to die
Mrs. Stan Smith.

17:42.494 --> 17:45.258
Wait! Sexpun, do you still
have that ring I gave you?

17:45.364 --> 17:48.390
- Yes.
- I just remembered S. Gave me that ring!

17:48.500 --> 17:50.798
Quick! Put it on!

17:54.373 --> 17:57.740
- Great work, Sexpun.
- Stan, we have to stop Tearjerker.

17:59.311 --> 18:03.304
What? Right.
Look, there's no way to stop the film.

18:03.415 --> 18:08.148
<i>So we need to find something that the world
wants to watch more than Oscar Gold.</i>

18:08.253 --> 18:12.087
Wait! Who is that?
Is that Adrien Brody and Halle Berry?

18:12.191 --> 18:14.386
He's keeping robots
in his dungeon?

18:14.493 --> 18:16.393
No, it's really them.

18:16.495 --> 18:20.522
Tearjerker kept a few celebrities alive
to do blow with.

18:20.632 --> 18:24.625
Stan? Stan? Ho!

18:24.736 --> 18:27.136
What's Halle Berry holding?

18:27.239 --> 18:29.969
Oh, my God!
I've got an idea!

18:30.075 --> 18:32.441
Sexpun, get those celebrities
up here right away.

18:45.224 --> 18:48.284
Um, Tearjerker, something's wrong.

18:52.664 --> 18:55.428
Why is everyone leaving?
Why aren't they staying and dying?

18:55.534 --> 18:58.628
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!</i>

18:58.737 --> 19:01.433
Smith! He found the one thing
people want to see...

19:01.540 --> 19:05.670
more than a Holocaust movie about a mentally
retarded boy with a cancer-riddled puppy!

19:05.777 --> 19:10.180
<i>Celebrity babies!
They're all going home to see them online!</i>

19:10.282 --> 19:12.375
That's nice, guys.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.248
Okay, Matt Damon
and Lucy Liu, you're next.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.754
Oh, look at the little guy.

19:17.856 --> 19:20.154
Its dad's A-list
and its mom's B-list.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.159
So it's a B-plus right off the bat.

19:23.428 --> 19:26.989
No-o-o!
This isn't over, Smith.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.590
Tears, drop!

19:35.340 --> 19:38.366
Really?

19:38.477 --> 19:42.174
You'll never catch me!

19:42.281 --> 19:44.476
Just climbed right up the ropes,
didn't you?

19:44.583 --> 19:46.847
I told the contractor
retractable ropes...

19:46.952 --> 19:49.420
because I foresaw this very situation.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.786
I tell you, when I build my next lair,
I'm gonna do a lot of things differently.

19:52.891 --> 19:55.553
More quicksand, more death beams,
and a bench in the shower.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.561
'Cause sometimes
I like to sit down.

19:57.663 --> 20:01.030
Face it, Tearjerker.
You've jerked your last tear.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.897
You think so?
Well, guess again!

20:15.414 --> 20:18.178
I'll be back, Mr. Smith.
I've written another film.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.444
<i>And it's even sadder
than Oscar Gold.</i>

20:20.552 --> 20:24.955
It's six hours of a baby chimp
trying to revive its dead mother.

20:33.732 --> 20:37.668
Mike, you're the worst contractor ever!

20:44.243 --> 20:46.643
I love you, Stan Smith.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.578
And I love you, Sexpun Smith.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.885
<i>Oh, my God!
You really are a virgin.</i>

20:54.987 --> 20:56.921
<i>What? That's not good?</i>

20:57.022 --> 20:59.013
<i>No. It's awful.</i>

21:46.672 --> 21:48.572
Bye. Have a beautiful time.
