Female pa announcer:
flight 2570, new york, jfk,

00:10.162 --> 00:11.996
Now boarding all rows.

00:12.030 --> 00:14.081
- okay, well, there you go,
young lady.

00:14.132 --> 00:16.000
Off into
the wild blue yonder.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.334
- great.

00:17.368 --> 00:19.387
Maybe i'll get lucky
and my plane will explode

00:19.421 --> 00:20.388
In mid-air.

00:20.422 --> 00:22.590
- i don't get it, becks.

00:22.641 --> 00:24.842
What could possibly
be so awful

00:24.876 --> 00:26.093
About visiting the woman

00:26.144 --> 00:29.096
Who pushed you through
her magnificent vagina?

00:29.147 --> 00:30.598
In new york.

00:30.649 --> 00:32.566
In the fall, no less.

00:32.601 --> 00:33.818
You're gonna be
stepping off that plane

00:33.852 --> 00:35.352
Into a woody allen film.

00:35.386 --> 00:38.155
And not recent woody allen,
old woody allen.

00:38.190 --> 00:39.940
<i>annie hall,
manhattan woody allen.</i>

00:39.991 --> 00:42.526
I'm pretty jealous
right now.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.196
- chelsea has lakers tickets.

00:45.230 --> 00:46.947
- so what?
you hate basketball.

00:46.998 --> 00:48.499
- you're missing the point.

00:48.533 --> 00:50.451
It's a killer scene.

00:50.502 --> 00:52.036
- [sighs]

00:52.070 --> 00:54.672
I know you're in there
somewhere, baby girl.

00:54.706 --> 00:57.007
My sweet little
partner in crime.

00:57.042 --> 00:58.709
And you're having a good
laugh about this,

00:58.743 --> 01:00.410
Even if it's only
on the inside.

01:02.297 --> 01:05.433
All right, well,
have a nice trip.

01:05.467 --> 01:07.518
Kiss mama bear for me.

01:07.552 --> 01:09.220
I love you.

01:11.523 --> 01:13.941
- stay.

01:13.975 --> 01:14.975
- stay?

01:15.026 --> 01:16.644
Stay.

01:16.695 --> 01:18.229
Stay.

01:18.263 --> 01:20.314
Come on, turn around,
just once.

01:20.365 --> 01:21.649
Then i'll know
you still love me.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.567
Please, god, send me
a sign from on high.

01:23.601 --> 01:27.238
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

01:27.272 --> 01:29.490
Oh, yeah, that's what
i'm talking about.

01:31.576 --> 01:32.960
[clicks tongue]

01:32.994 --> 01:35.963
[upbeat music]

01:35.997 --> 01:43.971

02:17.756 --> 02:19.707
- all right, well,
she's up, up and away.

02:19.758 --> 02:20.925
Karen, on phone:
i'm so excited.

02:20.959 --> 02:23.427
I can't wait to squeeze
that little peanut.

02:23.461 --> 02:25.012
- i wouldn't get too excited.

02:25.046 --> 02:26.547
She hasn't been
very pleasant lately.

02:26.598 --> 02:28.432
Kind of a little shit,
actually.

02:28.466 --> 02:31.135
- hey, come on.
don't poison the well.

02:31.169 --> 02:32.887
I know we're gonna have
a great time, she and i.

02:32.938 --> 02:33.888
I can feel it.

02:33.939 --> 02:35.139
Okus-dokus.

02:35.173 --> 02:36.390
I'm just warning you,

02:36.441 --> 02:39.810
Something post-pubescent
and wicked your way comes.

02:39.844 --> 02:41.278
- i wish you could come with.

02:41.313 --> 02:42.530
- yeah, me too.

02:42.564 --> 02:44.281
I'm not looking forward
to this weekend much.

02:44.316 --> 02:45.950
- come on, hank.
he's your best friend.

02:45.984 --> 02:47.701
- yeah, once upon a time,
in long island.

02:47.736 --> 02:49.119
He calls me up
out of the blue.

02:49.154 --> 02:50.354
Haven't talked to him
in years.

02:50.372 --> 02:51.739
Says he's got something
important to talk about.

02:51.790 --> 02:54.158
- whatever.
just have fun, you know?

02:54.192 --> 02:55.292
- all right, well, um...

02:55.327 --> 02:56.911
Call me when she lands.
give her a kiss for me.

02:56.962 --> 02:58.746
Give yourself a kiss
for me too. [kiss]

02:58.797 --> 03:00.047
- talk to you later.

03:00.081 --> 03:01.465
- bye. bye.

03:03.668 --> 03:04.835
- moody!
you handsome motherfucker.

03:04.869 --> 03:07.254
I just have to have me
a piece of that ass.

03:07.305 --> 03:08.255
- fuckin'...
[laughing]

03:08.306 --> 03:10.224
- wait, i'm not through.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.976
- zloz, shit.

03:12.010 --> 03:13.060
- what's up, buddy?

03:13.094 --> 03:15.563
- where'd that plane come from,
1987?

03:15.597 --> 03:17.982
You look exactly the same.
and that smell.

03:18.016 --> 03:20.717
What is that, booze,
cigarettes, and drakkar noir?

03:20.735 --> 03:21.902
Takes me right back.

03:21.937 --> 03:23.771
- yeah, well, what about you?
look at you.

03:23.822 --> 03:25.656
You look like half a fag
in this smoking jacket.

03:25.690 --> 03:27.441
You smell pretty much
the same...

03:27.492 --> 03:29.276
Like a cock dipped in shit.

03:29.327 --> 03:32.913
- aww.
it's good to see you, man.

03:32.948 --> 03:34.582
Yeah, it's been
a long time.

03:34.616 --> 03:35.916
- yeah, well,
whose fault is that?

03:35.951 --> 03:37.501
Who never comes back
to the island?

03:37.535 --> 03:39.920
Fuckin' fancy book writer
hank moody, that's who.

03:39.955 --> 03:42.790
- well, you know,
they won't let me back.

03:42.841 --> 03:45.125
I divulged too many
small town secrets.

03:45.176 --> 03:46.627
Named too many names.

03:46.678 --> 03:48.045
- ah, right.

03:48.079 --> 03:50.681
Well, here i finally am,
man, in l.a.

03:50.715 --> 03:52.099
L-fuckin'-a.

03:52.133 --> 03:53.467
- yeah, well, what's up?

03:53.518 --> 03:55.603
You sounded pretty mysterious
on the phone.

03:55.637 --> 03:56.971
- ah, yeah, later.
later for that, man.

03:57.022 --> 03:58.439
There's plenty of time
to shoot the shit.

03:58.473 --> 04:00.608
First, i want to see
britney's vertical smile.

04:00.642 --> 04:02.810
- ooh. i don't know
if she's showing this week.

04:02.861 --> 04:04.144
I'll have to check
the schedule.

04:04.195 --> 04:05.229
- all right, well, then,

04:05.263 --> 04:06.447
I want to act
like a millionaire

04:06.481 --> 04:07.815
And get properly faced

04:07.866 --> 04:09.483
With my best buddy
in the whole world,

04:09.534 --> 04:10.484
Hank moody.

04:10.535 --> 04:11.819
- all right.
- what do you say?

04:11.870 --> 04:13.537
- i say we do it.
let's shoot the moon.

04:13.571 --> 04:15.239
If we only get halfway there,
so be it.

04:15.273 --> 04:16.740
It's better than
working for the man.

04:16.774 --> 04:18.742
- yeah, or dying five miles
from where you were born.

04:18.776 --> 04:19.910
Both: mr. amato.

04:19.944 --> 04:22.546
- 11th grade english.
words to live by.

04:22.580 --> 04:25.582
You know, come on,
let's get fuckin' ossified.

04:28.670 --> 04:29.837
Hank: how many kids now?

04:31.890 --> 04:34.091
- three, which is...

04:34.125 --> 04:36.677
Three too fuckin' many.

04:36.728 --> 04:38.512
Hey, look i made you
come with one finger.

04:38.563 --> 04:40.514
You imagine what
i could do with the rest.

04:40.565 --> 04:42.933
- jesus christ, zloz,
that old chestnut?

04:42.967 --> 04:44.852
Stand down, charm school.

04:44.903 --> 04:47.521
I apologize for my friend.
he's sick in the head.

04:47.572 --> 04:49.189
Just two days
out of the asylum.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.858
He's doing okay,
having said that.

04:50.909 --> 04:52.743
We'd like another round,
my lady, if you don't mind.

04:52.777 --> 04:53.744
- sure.
- thank you.

04:53.778 --> 04:55.412
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

04:55.447 --> 04:56.997
- what? what?

04:57.032 --> 05:00.534
I'm sorry.
i'm sorry.

05:00.585 --> 05:01.869
There's smokin' hot bitches

05:01.920 --> 05:03.203
Everywhere you look,
you know?

05:03.254 --> 05:05.539
What's the move here?
- the move?

05:05.590 --> 05:07.958
- i mean, they all seem
like a bunch of stuck up cunts.

05:07.992 --> 05:09.376
- that's the move.
that's the line.

05:09.427 --> 05:11.295
Try that one out.
see where it gets you.

05:11.329 --> 05:12.546
- you still pulling
a ton of ass?

05:12.597 --> 05:13.847
- i do all right.

05:13.882 --> 05:15.182
- yeah?
i got my dick wet first.

05:15.216 --> 05:16.350
Remember that shit.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.851
- hey, you guys ready
to settle up?

05:17.886 --> 05:19.887
- yeah.
- no, fuck you.

05:19.938 --> 05:22.056
- no, let me.
whoa, let me.

05:23.558 --> 05:24.608
- hmm.

05:27.062 --> 05:29.530
[giggles]

05:30.815 --> 05:31.815
- look at me.

05:31.849 --> 05:32.983
- i'm, you know...

05:33.017 --> 05:35.619
I feel a little
underdressed in this joint.

05:35.653 --> 05:37.905
- that's because you are
underdressed.

05:37.956 --> 05:40.040
You look like
a fuckin' landscaper.

05:40.075 --> 05:42.710
- i am a fuckin' landscaper.

05:42.744 --> 05:44.411
I own my own business now,
thank you very much.

05:44.462 --> 05:45.462
- that's terrific.
good for you.

05:45.497 --> 05:46.863
- not quite as nice
as getting paid

05:46.881 --> 05:47.915
To make shit up.

05:47.966 --> 05:49.466
- that is much harder
than it looks.

05:49.501 --> 05:51.668
- right.

05:51.702 --> 05:53.087
Oh, man.

05:53.138 --> 05:56.090
I'd love to have her
sit on my face before i die.

05:56.141 --> 05:57.758
- like you'd ever
cheat on kim.

05:57.809 --> 05:58.976
How is she?

05:59.010 --> 06:01.011
- that's what
i meant to tell you, man.

06:01.045 --> 06:02.513
- what?

06:02.547 --> 06:04.515
- we're through.
- what?

06:04.549 --> 06:06.734
- we called it quits, man.
it's over.

06:06.768 --> 06:07.735
- what happened?

06:07.769 --> 06:10.320
- got in a fight.

06:10.355 --> 06:11.688
Words were spoken.

06:11.722 --> 06:13.440
Household appliances
were thrown.

06:13.491 --> 06:15.492
I got in a cab.

06:15.527 --> 06:17.745
Hopped on a plane for l.a.

06:17.779 --> 06:19.563
You don't mind if i crash
on your couch

06:19.581 --> 06:20.897
For a couple of weeks,
do you?

06:20.915 --> 06:22.166
- yeah, i mind.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.834
I'm trying to raise
a daughter, numb nuts.

06:23.868 --> 06:25.369
- oh, becca.
how's she doing?

06:25.403 --> 06:26.787
What is she now, 15, 16?

06:26.838 --> 06:27.788
- you're not gonna do
any better than kim.

06:27.839 --> 06:28.789
She's beautiful.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.073
I used to jerk off
to that girl

06:30.091 --> 06:31.792
Every night in high school,
almost.

06:31.843 --> 06:33.743
You were my hero
when you nailed her.

06:33.762 --> 06:35.379
- yeah, well, uh,
how does the saying go?

06:35.413 --> 06:36.630
For every beautiful woman,

06:36.681 --> 06:38.182
There's a guy who's bored
of fucking her.

06:38.216 --> 06:40.184
Let's get out of here, man.
where's the party?

06:40.218 --> 06:41.435
- what party?

06:41.469 --> 06:43.437
- party, there's a party
out there somewhere.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.088
And there's a blonde
with big tits

06:45.106 --> 06:47.024
Waiting for me
to bang her stupid, all right?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.758
Call your agent.

06:48.777 --> 06:49.860
Call your agent.

06:49.894 --> 06:51.311
Isn't that what
he gets paid to do,

06:51.362 --> 06:52.780
Shit like that?
- you don't know my agent.

06:52.814 --> 06:54.698
- yeah, great,
so we'll see you there.

06:54.732 --> 06:55.949
Okay, looking forward to it.

06:55.984 --> 06:57.484
Any friend of yours.

06:57.535 --> 06:59.703
Oh, i'll see what
i can do about the blonde.

06:59.737 --> 07:01.622
With big tits, right?

07:01.656 --> 07:02.739
I'll make a note of that.

07:02.773 --> 07:04.124
See you, hank.

07:05.743 --> 07:09.213
[humming]

07:09.247 --> 07:11.498
- hey, you.

07:11.549 --> 07:13.717
- hey there, porn star.

07:13.751 --> 07:15.118
- hi.
- hey.

07:15.136 --> 07:17.838
Ay! yo! wow!

07:17.889 --> 07:20.340
Your boobs,
they're really...big.

07:20.391 --> 07:21.958
- i know, right?

07:21.976 --> 07:24.645
- so that's what my last
ten grand looks like, huh?

07:24.679 --> 07:26.063
- yep. you can touch them,
if you like.

07:26.097 --> 07:27.481
- really?
- well, sure.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.066
You paid for 'em.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.819
Feel me up, citizen.

07:31.853 --> 07:34.071
[door creaks shut]

07:35.440 --> 07:37.774
- oh.

07:37.808 --> 07:39.827
I knew you'd be back,
you know, sooner or later.

07:39.861 --> 07:41.478
[makes beeping noise]

07:41.496 --> 07:42.696
- oh, yeah?
you did?

07:42.747 --> 07:43.747
- sure, i said so, didn't i?

07:43.781 --> 07:44.832
This one's heavier.

07:44.866 --> 07:47.034
- yeah, you did.

07:47.085 --> 07:49.203
Yeah, when i broke up
with you.

07:49.254 --> 07:51.988
You were all,
"you'll be back.

07:52.006 --> 07:54.458
They all come back
sooner or later."

07:54.492 --> 07:56.009
- exactly, the thing is,
though, daisy,

07:56.044 --> 07:57.594
See, as much
as i look back fondly

07:57.629 --> 07:59.546
On our little afternoon
in the sun...

07:59.597 --> 08:00.681
[inhales sharply]

08:00.715 --> 08:01.965
I don't think
i can go back there.

08:01.999 --> 08:04.134
I'm trying to mend fences
with the missus.

08:04.168 --> 08:05.302
- aww.

08:05.336 --> 08:06.637
You two are great together.

08:06.671 --> 08:07.938
Good luck with that.

08:07.972 --> 08:09.306
- well, thank you.

08:09.340 --> 08:12.192
- okay...

08:12.227 --> 08:14.111
I have something
i need to tell you.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.063
- i'm all ears.

08:18.783 --> 08:20.684
- eyes, charlie.

08:20.702 --> 08:21.735
Okay.

08:21.786 --> 08:23.203
I've been making the rounds,

08:23.238 --> 08:24.688
Informing my partners

08:24.706 --> 08:27.207
Of the various stds
i've contracted.

08:27.242 --> 08:29.409
Nothing crazy, mind you.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.795
Nothing life-threatening
or anything like that.

08:31.829 --> 08:33.746
But you might want to get
to a doctor

08:33.798 --> 08:36.549
And have him whip up
some kind of cocktail.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.201
Help fight it off.

08:38.219 --> 08:39.720
'cause let me tell you,

08:39.754 --> 08:42.539
This is some really
pernicious shit.

08:42.557 --> 08:45.709
My vagina looks like
downtown baghdad right now.

08:47.645 --> 08:48.595
Charlie, are you okay?

08:48.646 --> 08:49.713
- yeah, i think so.

08:49.731 --> 08:50.764
I'm just--
i'm a little dizzy.

08:50.815 --> 08:52.316
And--and clammy too.

08:52.350 --> 08:54.551
Do i feel clammy to you?
is that how it starts?

08:58.523 --> 09:01.742
<i>- hey this is some serious
scarface shit here.</i>

09:01.776 --> 09:03.110
Runkles!

09:03.161 --> 09:05.529
- hey, it's the boys.

09:05.563 --> 09:07.531
- runkles.

09:07.565 --> 09:09.750
This here
is the almighty zloz,

09:09.784 --> 09:11.702
My oldest friend
from the island of long.

09:11.736 --> 09:13.420
- mr. almighty,
pleasure to meet you.

09:13.454 --> 09:14.838
- you too.
mike zlozowski.

09:14.872 --> 09:15.956
Very nice to meet you guys.

09:16.007 --> 09:17.374
- you've known him
a long time.

09:17.408 --> 09:19.426
Let me ask you,
was he always such a prick?

09:19.460 --> 09:21.211
- always!
he's always been a ball buster.

09:21.245 --> 09:23.180
I spent half my life
making sure this guy

09:23.214 --> 09:24.798
Didn't get his fuckin'
teeth kicked in.

09:24.849 --> 09:26.683
- that's true.
he's my bodyguard.

09:26.718 --> 09:27.917
- oh! welcome, boys.

09:27.936 --> 09:29.436
- hey.
- and girl.

09:29.470 --> 09:31.521
- ohh!

09:31.556 --> 09:33.307
You must be runkle.

09:33.358 --> 09:34.942
- in fact, i am.

09:34.976 --> 09:36.693
- ah, i see what you mean.

09:36.728 --> 09:38.562
Great head for helming.

09:38.596 --> 09:39.813
- mm, yeah.

09:39.864 --> 09:41.064
Oh, this is my husband,

09:41.098 --> 09:42.532
Ricardo collini.

09:42.567 --> 09:43.900
- call me dickie.

09:43.934 --> 09:45.819
- have fun, cap'n.

09:45.870 --> 09:46.820
You too.
[kiss]

09:46.871 --> 09:49.539
- ho, whoa.
hold on a minute there.

09:49.574 --> 09:50.657
You're married?

09:50.708 --> 09:53.493
- yeah, 25 years
and countin'.

09:53.544 --> 09:55.379
- i had no idea.

09:55.413 --> 09:57.080
- well, you never asked.

09:57.114 --> 09:58.999
- i feel very strange
about this.

09:59.050 --> 10:00.334
- runkle, don't worry.

10:00.385 --> 10:02.419
Dickie and i have
a very...

10:02.453 --> 10:04.304
A very open relationship.

10:04.339 --> 10:05.672
But, as you can see,

10:05.723 --> 10:07.307
He has some limitations.

10:07.342 --> 10:11.511
He is, however,
a master of the oral arts.

10:11.562 --> 10:15.849
You ought to try him
sometime, honey.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.517
- there's no place like home.

10:17.568 --> 10:20.020
There's no place like home.
there's no place like home.

10:20.071 --> 10:22.105
- is your father
a lumberjack?

10:22.139 --> 10:23.907
Because every time
i look at you,

10:23.941 --> 10:26.576
I get serious wood
in my pants.

10:26.611 --> 10:28.144
- [scoffs]

10:29.414 --> 10:31.248
- come on, what do--
what do--

10:31.282 --> 10:32.866
What do you think,
you're better than me?

10:32.917 --> 10:34.001
Come on.

10:34.035 --> 10:35.535
- nice one, shecky greene.

10:37.705 --> 10:40.490
- to the city of angels
and its stuck-up snatch.

10:40.508 --> 10:41.792
- can't we do
better than that?

10:41.826 --> 10:44.678
Let's drink to levittown,
from whence we came.

10:46.631 --> 10:48.164
- i don't know, moody.

10:48.182 --> 10:49.800
I think i could get used
to this, you know.

10:49.834 --> 10:51.385
I got a few
screenplay ideas.

10:51.436 --> 10:54.604
What's--what's stopping me
from taking this town by storm?

10:54.639 --> 10:56.673
- me. just me.
i won't let you.

10:56.691 --> 10:58.725
- oh, yeah?
you gonna get in my way?

10:58.776 --> 11:00.944
You gonna keep it
all for yourself?

11:00.978 --> 11:02.529
- that? that out there?

11:02.563 --> 11:03.680
That's a fuckin' mirage.

11:03.698 --> 11:05.615
That doesn't exist,
behind me.

11:05.650 --> 11:07.684
You got everything you could
ever want or need back home.

11:07.702 --> 11:08.819
Trust me.

11:08.853 --> 11:10.287
- what the fuck do you know
about back home?

11:10.321 --> 11:12.188
You got out years ago.

11:12.206 --> 11:16.025
Now, it's easy for you to spout
some working class hero,

11:16.044 --> 11:18.879
Springsteen bullshit about
the sanctity of small towns

11:18.913 --> 11:21.030
When you're driving a porsche
through the promised land.

11:21.049 --> 11:22.582
- you got it all wrong, man.

11:22.633 --> 11:23.834
- i got it all wrong?
listen.

11:23.868 --> 11:25.419
You see that--you see
that girl over there?

11:25.470 --> 11:26.420
- yes.

11:26.471 --> 11:27.838
- i'm gonna go talk to her.

11:27.872 --> 11:29.873
Maybe she's warm
for my form,

11:29.891 --> 11:31.341
Maybe not, but...

11:31.375 --> 11:32.559
You know,
i'm no marky mark,

11:32.593 --> 11:34.311
But i'm going down
swinging tonight.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.595
- all right.
- wish me luck.

11:35.646 --> 11:36.680
- good luck.

11:36.714 --> 11:38.148
[whispers] fuck.

11:40.568 --> 11:41.601
- what are you doing?

11:41.652 --> 11:43.937
Oh, wow, this is--

11:43.988 --> 11:45.272
- yeah!
- ooh.

11:45.323 --> 11:48.108
- look...all this erotica,
got me all--

11:48.159 --> 11:49.392
- grande.
- yeah.

11:49.577 --> 11:51.278
I'm all sexed up and shit.

11:51.329 --> 11:52.746
And you know how i am.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.564
The more i gets,
the more i wants.

11:54.582 --> 11:56.867
- yeah, but not tonight,
maybe.

11:56.901 --> 11:59.002
You know, maybe--maybe
we just take a break, you know.

11:59.036 --> 12:02.005
- what? why don't
you want to fuck me?

12:02.039 --> 12:03.924
- 'cause this
is my boss's house.

12:03.958 --> 12:05.208
That's why.

12:05.242 --> 12:08.378
- yeah, baby, and your boss
is a stone freak.

12:08.412 --> 12:09.913
I think she would
very much approve

12:09.931 --> 12:12.265
Of a quickie happening
right under her own roof.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.384
[machinery whirring]
- shoosh!

12:14.418 --> 12:16.386
Well, really,
i'm sore still.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.087
I mean, chafed, really.

12:18.106 --> 12:20.557
- okay, what the fuck
is going on?

12:20.591 --> 12:22.526
- nothing, i'm just--
i'm, you know,

12:22.560 --> 12:23.944
I guess a little,
uh, uh,

12:23.978 --> 12:27.063
Overwhelmed by the whiplash
nature of our relationship--

12:27.097 --> 12:28.115
- bullshit!

12:28.149 --> 12:29.766
You fucked someone else,
didn't you?

12:29.784 --> 12:31.768
- no! no, never.

12:31.786 --> 12:35.572
I am done
with that behavior.

12:35.606 --> 12:37.106
- something's going on
with you.

12:37.125 --> 12:39.543
- [sighs]

12:39.577 --> 12:42.295
Daisy...came to see me.

12:42.330 --> 12:44.498
- oh! i knew it!

12:44.549 --> 12:46.166
I fucking knew it.

12:46.217 --> 12:47.884
A woman knows that shit.

12:47.919 --> 12:50.387
So, what, you want to get
back together with her now?

12:50.421 --> 12:52.556
You're gonna have some
skanky little porno babies?

12:52.590 --> 12:54.925
Why don't you make up your
fucking mind already, runkle?

12:54.959 --> 12:56.092
- no!

12:56.126 --> 12:58.294
No, i told her i want
to be with you,

12:58.312 --> 13:01.264
Only you...
my one true love.

13:01.349 --> 13:02.983
- really?

13:04.852 --> 13:07.020
What'd she say,
that little tramp?

13:07.071 --> 13:08.939
- well, actually--
and this is interesting--

13:08.973 --> 13:10.139
[clears throat]

13:10.158 --> 13:12.576
She said that she had
contracted a few stds.

13:12.610 --> 13:13.910
Nothing crazy, mind you.

13:13.945 --> 13:16.163
Nothing a bolus of antibiotics
wouldn't cure.

13:16.197 --> 13:17.664
Just...knock it out.

13:17.748 --> 13:19.282
- oh, god.

13:19.367 --> 13:22.002
No, i seriously think
i'm gonna throw up right now.

13:22.036 --> 13:24.704
- that is exactly
what i said! right?

13:24.755 --> 13:26.173
Or, well, i don't know.

13:26.207 --> 13:28.124
Maybe i said, uh,
i was dizzy.

13:28.158 --> 13:30.043
But it's the same difference,
really.

13:30.094 --> 13:33.180
Ow! fuck!
fuck.

13:33.214 --> 13:36.349
- i'm taking your little fucking
girl car, charlie.

13:36.384 --> 13:40.470
<i>and don't you dare bother
coming home tonight!</i>

13:40.504 --> 13:42.389
- fucking hell.

13:43.841 --> 13:45.058
[pool balls clack]

13:45.109 --> 13:47.027
- dude! she's got a cock!

13:47.061 --> 13:48.195
- really?

13:48.229 --> 13:51.114
Sure it wasn't just
an oversized clit?

13:51.148 --> 13:52.566
- i know a cock
when i touch one.

13:52.617 --> 13:55.485
I-i--we were messing around,
okay, in the hot tub.

13:55.519 --> 13:56.686
I was getting ready
to close.

13:56.704 --> 13:58.238
She says she wants
to tell me something.

13:58.289 --> 13:59.789
I thought she had
a boyfriend or whatever.

13:59.824 --> 14:01.625
Next thing i know,
she's guiding my hand

14:01.659 --> 14:04.211
Down to her
thin, bent dong.

14:04.245 --> 14:05.745
- then what, you gave her
a handy?

14:05.796 --> 14:07.297
- fuck you, man.
i fuckin' clocked her.

14:07.331 --> 14:09.365
- there's laws.
you can't do that.

14:09.383 --> 14:10.667
That's a human being.

14:10.701 --> 14:12.535
You can't just be
throwing punches at people.

14:12.553 --> 14:15.055
- what the fuck
is wrong with you, moody?

14:15.089 --> 14:16.556
Have you been in l.a.
so long

14:16.591 --> 14:19.976
That a chick with a dick
means nothing to you?

14:20.011 --> 14:21.645
- hey!

14:21.679 --> 14:23.980
Your friend's a closeted
fucking homo!

14:24.015 --> 14:25.515
- that's what i've been
telling him for years.

14:25.549 --> 14:26.516
I have, really.

14:26.550 --> 14:28.902
- see, them's fightin' words.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.353
- asshole.
- you're gonna hit me now?

14:30.387 --> 14:31.821
- i thought you knew.

14:31.856 --> 14:33.056
When i realized you didn't,

14:33.074 --> 14:35.242
I tried to break it
to you gently.

14:35.276 --> 14:38.028
- well, for what it's worth,
i think you're beautiful.

14:38.062 --> 14:40.196
I think you could
totally pass for a lady.

14:40.230 --> 14:42.198
- thank you, sweetie.
- anytime.

14:42.232 --> 14:43.399
- oh, that's great.

14:43.417 --> 14:44.400
Why don't you guys
get a room, maybe,

14:44.418 --> 14:45.702
And suck each other's dicks?

14:45.736 --> 14:48.204
- i think he knew,
deep down.

14:48.238 --> 14:49.923
He was looking
for a little meat.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.207
- mm, possibil--

14:51.241 --> 14:52.759
Uhh! shit.

14:52.793 --> 14:54.044
- uhh!

14:54.078 --> 14:55.762
- pause!

14:55.796 --> 14:58.048
- boys, enough!

14:59.050 --> 15:00.684
Up.

15:00.718 --> 15:02.769
There'll be no fighting
in this house.

15:02.803 --> 15:05.438
This place is made for love.

15:05.473 --> 15:07.057
The collinis are open

15:07.091 --> 15:10.477
To all sizes, shapes,
and sexual preferences.

15:10.528 --> 15:13.480
Ignorance will not
be tolerated.

15:13.531 --> 15:14.698
- you're absolutely right,
sue.

15:14.732 --> 15:16.149
We are deeply ashamed.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.867
Deeply.
right, zloz?

15:17.902 --> 15:19.736
- maybe you are...
- zloz.

15:19.770 --> 15:22.205
- i am deeply ashamed...

15:22.239 --> 15:24.324
That i touched
a tranny's cock.

15:24.375 --> 15:25.959
- all right, all right!

15:27.878 --> 15:31.298
Now that we've got that
cleared away,

15:31.332 --> 15:33.783
You boys wanna
go skiing with me?

15:35.619 --> 15:36.836
- yeah, okay.
- uh-huh. ooh.

15:36.887 --> 15:38.805
<i>[buckcherry's crazy bitch]</i>

15:38.839 --> 15:41.758
- ? all right ?

15:41.792 --> 15:46.229
? ?

15:46.263 --> 15:48.181
- whoo!

15:55.573 --> 15:58.024
- hank, this is more like it!

15:58.075 --> 16:00.110
You see the mams
on this broad?

16:00.144 --> 16:02.162
- this guy was your b.f.f.?

16:02.196 --> 16:03.580
I don't see it.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.332
- you wouldn't know it
to look at him now,

16:05.366 --> 16:07.083
But he was the coolest kid
in high school.

16:07.118 --> 16:09.169
Not the smartest, but he was
definitely the funniest.

16:09.203 --> 16:10.670
A regular fuckin' riot.

16:10.705 --> 16:12.321
He had
the hottest girlfriend.

16:12.340 --> 16:15.175
We all wanted to be him.
i worshipped the guy.

16:15.209 --> 16:17.127
- i like you like this.

16:17.161 --> 16:18.211
- like what?

16:18.262 --> 16:20.463
- like my new boyfriend.

16:24.001 --> 16:25.769
- be careful, ladies.

16:25.803 --> 16:28.388
I think i might
have an std.

16:28.439 --> 16:29.806
- you don't happen to have
a dick, do you?

16:29.840 --> 16:30.857
No offense.

16:30.891 --> 16:33.360
- none taken.

16:33.394 --> 16:36.363
- nope! no dick.

16:36.397 --> 16:39.065
No pubic hair, either.
dig that shit.

16:39.116 --> 16:41.568
I'm sorry i doubted you,
sweetheart.

16:41.619 --> 16:44.237
- bad boy.
i'm gonna punish you.

16:44.288 --> 16:46.539
You're my bitch.

16:46.574 --> 16:48.708
That's right.
oh, yeah.

16:48.743 --> 16:51.327
- ? you're a crazy bitch,
but you fuck so good ?

16:51.361 --> 16:52.712
? i'm on top of it ?

16:52.747 --> 16:54.664
- you wanna be my--
what--dude.

16:54.698 --> 16:55.832
Wai-wait, hey.

16:55.866 --> 16:57.751
Hey! stop it!

16:57.802 --> 16:59.636
Asshole! get off!

16:59.670 --> 17:01.755
Hey! hey, fucker!

17:01.806 --> 17:03.139
Get off!

17:03.174 --> 17:04.707
- you're out of here!

17:04.724 --> 17:05.809
- hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:05.843 --> 17:07.310
Whoa, whoa.
what happened?

17:07.344 --> 17:08.728
What'd he say?
what'd he do?

17:08.762 --> 17:11.064
- he was sucking on her titty,
and that ain't cool.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.016
- that is not cool.
what the fuck are you thinking?

17:13.050 --> 17:14.233
- hey, man, did you
see those things?

17:14.268 --> 17:15.518
They were epic, man.

17:15.551 --> 17:18.855
It was like pamela anderson
meets samantha fox.

17:18.888 --> 17:20.406
Remember samantha fox?
- shut up, shut up.

17:20.441 --> 17:22.275
- tits for days!
- i apologize.

17:22.326 --> 17:23.660
- tits for days!
- shut up!

17:23.694 --> 17:24.861
- you know what?

17:24.895 --> 17:26.195
I'm throwing working class
out on his ass.

17:26.230 --> 17:27.196
- working class?

17:27.231 --> 17:29.115
- uhh! unh!

17:29.166 --> 17:30.917
- uhh!

17:30.951 --> 17:32.235
- yah! uhh!

17:32.253 --> 17:33.620
- watch it!

17:33.671 --> 17:34.671
- uhh! agh!

17:34.705 --> 17:35.789
[glasses shattering]

17:35.840 --> 17:37.924
- uhh.

17:37.958 --> 17:39.259
- unh!

17:39.293 --> 17:41.294
<i>- you with me, compadre?</i>

17:43.514 --> 17:45.632
Bouncer: aaah!

18:32.096 --> 18:33.563
- [karate yell,
neck cracks]

18:33.597 --> 18:35.682
[groans]

18:53.317 --> 18:54.701
[belches]

19:19.059 --> 19:22.979
- [light snoring]

19:47.338 --> 19:50.539
- well, good morning, teach.

19:50.558 --> 19:52.842
Wow, our very first
sleepover.

19:52.876 --> 19:54.761
- i wish i remembered
more of it.

19:54.812 --> 19:56.930
- did we take
a bubble bath?

19:56.981 --> 20:00.066
- there is evidence
to support that theory, yes.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.185
- [giggles]

20:03.771 --> 20:06.656
- can i ask you a favor?

20:06.690 --> 20:08.658
- [snoring lightly]

20:23.740 --> 20:25.174
- uhh.

20:29.746 --> 20:31.247
- good morning.

20:31.265 --> 20:32.748
- good morning.

20:32.766 --> 20:34.634
Ooh. ooh. ooh.

20:34.685 --> 20:36.469
Uh, um...

20:36.520 --> 20:38.521
Wow. did we--
did we, um--

20:38.555 --> 20:40.139
- oh, fuck, yeah.

20:40.190 --> 20:42.091
- hmm. mm.

20:42.109 --> 20:43.476
Was i any good?

20:43.527 --> 20:44.644
- oh, the best.

20:44.645 --> 20:47.280
You've got a great cock.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.482
- fuckin'-a.

20:49.533 --> 20:52.402
Good times.

20:52.436 --> 20:54.404
- morning, kids.

20:54.438 --> 20:56.939
- [grunts]

20:56.957 --> 20:57.991
Dude.

20:58.042 --> 20:59.492
- buddy?
[chuckles]

21:13.457 --> 21:15.642
- this place
is beautiful, man.

21:15.676 --> 21:18.061
Takes your breath away,
sometimes.

21:18.095 --> 21:20.346
- that's one of the perks.

21:20.397 --> 21:21.764
That and in-n-out burger.

21:21.798 --> 21:24.300
- i got a question for you.
- shoot.

21:24.318 --> 21:26.853
- how come you never made it
to my wedding, man?

21:26.904 --> 21:29.155
- oh, man.

21:29.189 --> 21:31.190
I don't know.

21:31.241 --> 21:33.776
I guess i was pissed.

21:33.810 --> 21:34.911
You know, uh...

21:34.945 --> 21:36.863
I didn't want to see you
ruin your life.

21:36.914 --> 21:38.915
We had a plan.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.700
- right, and i fucked it up.

21:40.751 --> 21:41.984
- well...

21:42.002 --> 21:43.152
And we were gonna
get out of there,

21:43.170 --> 21:44.420
The two of us, together.

21:44.455 --> 21:45.705
You were gonna be
a rock star.

21:45.756 --> 21:47.707
I was gonna be
a famous writer.

21:47.758 --> 21:49.342
That's the way i thought
back then.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.510
Black and white.

21:50.544 --> 21:52.628
I was a fuckin' idiot.

21:52.662 --> 21:53.829
Couldn't have been
more wrong.

21:53.847 --> 21:55.348
You did a beautiful thing.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.383
You stepped up,
married that girl,

21:57.434 --> 21:58.968
Had a family.

21:59.002 --> 22:00.887
Don't fuck it up.

22:00.938 --> 22:04.273
Don't chase these...
girls with fake titties

22:04.308 --> 22:07.310
And half-baked
screenplay ideas.

22:07.344 --> 22:08.644
- dude...

22:08.678 --> 22:12.315
I'm sorry
about your father, man.

22:12.349 --> 22:14.617
- yeah.
thank you.

22:14.651 --> 22:17.320
Um...

22:17.354 --> 22:19.622
[sighs] thanks for
the flowers that you sent.

22:22.659 --> 22:24.193
- did you hear about
mr. amato?

22:24.211 --> 22:26.379
He passed away last year.
- did he?

22:26.413 --> 22:28.331
- yeah.
- shit.

22:28.365 --> 22:30.466
Well, i guess that really
proves his theory.

22:30.501 --> 22:32.868
That you--
you really do die

22:32.886 --> 22:35.054
Less than five miles
from where you were born.

22:35.089 --> 22:38.341
- now, that might
happen to me now.

22:38.375 --> 22:39.809
- what?
what do you mean?

22:39.843 --> 22:41.594
- ah, man, you know,
i get these nosebleeds.

22:41.645 --> 22:44.147
- what do you mean nosebleeds?
what are you talking about?

22:44.181 --> 22:45.932
- you know, i never thought
much about them,

22:45.983 --> 22:48.735
But kim finally made me
go to the doctor.

22:48.769 --> 22:51.237
And it turns out
i'm sick, dude.

22:51.271 --> 22:54.190
- what do you mean sick?
what kind of sick?

22:54.224 --> 22:55.491
- i mean sick like i gotta--

22:55.526 --> 22:57.410
Like i got something
i gotta deal with sick.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.579
I got to get a whole
shitload of tests.

22:59.613 --> 23:01.247
I keep putting it off.

23:01.281 --> 23:03.699
And that's why kim and i had
that big fuckin' blowout, man.

23:03.733 --> 23:05.785
It's not a good time
right now.

23:06.003 --> 23:08.571
Ugh!

23:08.589 --> 23:11.907
Ah, at least i got
to see all this, though, man.

23:11.925 --> 23:14.510
- zloz...yo!

23:14.545 --> 23:16.129
You're not gonna die.

23:16.180 --> 23:17.346
- [chuckles]

23:17.381 --> 23:19.348
Maybe, you know.
maybe not.

23:19.383 --> 23:21.100
Whatever happens,

23:21.135 --> 23:23.752
It's got me thinking about
a lot of things, you know?

23:23.771 --> 23:26.105
About fuckin' short
it all is.

23:26.140 --> 23:28.224
How you and i,
once upon a time,

23:28.258 --> 23:30.109
We were thick as thieves.

23:30.144 --> 23:31.861
I don't know what happened.

23:31.895 --> 23:33.946
I just wish i knew
the moment where it all changed,

23:34.148 --> 23:35.931
Because i would
do things differently.

23:35.949 --> 23:37.450
- you didn't
do anything wrong.

23:37.484 --> 23:42.572
I didn't mean to let things
slide with you, zloz.

23:42.606 --> 23:44.740
I guess i did.

23:44.774 --> 23:47.210
- you were
my best friend, hank.

23:47.244 --> 23:48.911
I'll never forget.

23:48.945 --> 23:52.131
Some of the greatest
times of my life, you know?

23:52.166 --> 23:55.468
Maybe that makes me a big,
pathetic fuckin' loser,

23:55.502 --> 23:57.637
But...once upon a time

23:57.671 --> 23:59.388
Has got to count
for something, i figure.

23:59.423 --> 24:01.340
Right?
- course it does.

24:01.391 --> 24:04.644
I just--i didn't
belong there anymore.

24:04.678 --> 24:06.896
Fuck, i don't belong here,
either.

24:06.930 --> 24:09.649
It doesn't--it doesn't
change the fact

24:09.683 --> 24:11.567
That i love you, man.

24:17.825 --> 24:19.942
I can't believe...

24:19.976 --> 24:23.329
I haven't seen you cry
since thurman munson died.

24:23.363 --> 24:25.248
- you got to bring up
thurman munson?

24:25.282 --> 24:26.616
You fucking asshole.

24:26.650 --> 24:27.750
- i had to go there because...
- don't go with munson.

24:27.784 --> 24:29.418
- you were crying,
i was crying.

24:29.453 --> 24:30.920
It was beautiful.

24:30.954 --> 24:32.455
- you were crying
about andy gibb.

24:32.489 --> 24:34.257
- ? well, i saw a werewolf ?

24:34.291 --> 24:37.210
? with a chinese menu
in his hand ?

24:37.261 --> 24:42.548
? walking through the streets
of soho in the rain ?

24:42.599 --> 24:43.966
? ra-hoo ?

24:44.000 --> 24:47.186
? werewolves of london ?

24:47.221 --> 24:49.939
? ra-hoo ?

24:49.973 --> 24:51.557
? ?

24:51.608 --> 24:53.392
? ra-hoo ?

24:53.443 --> 24:55.444
- sorry i got to drop you off
so early.

24:55.479 --> 24:57.647
I got to pick up
the little monster.

24:57.681 --> 24:59.982
- no worries.

25:00.016 --> 25:01.617
Gives me plenty of time
to get loaded

25:01.652 --> 25:04.871
And piss myself
on the plane.

25:10.994 --> 25:12.912
- it was good
to see you, zloz.

25:12.963 --> 25:13.963
- yeah, you too, man.

25:13.997 --> 25:15.915
Thanks for showing me
a good time.

25:15.966 --> 25:20.553
You know, uh,
what happens in l.a...

25:20.587 --> 25:22.471
Right, brother?
- yes, it stays in the vault.

25:22.506 --> 25:24.039
You think you're gonna
be able to patch things up

25:24.057 --> 25:25.040
With the old lady?

25:25.058 --> 25:26.092
- to tell you the truth,

25:26.143 --> 25:28.094
She doesn't even
know i'm gone.

25:28.145 --> 25:29.762
She was so pissed at me,

25:29.813 --> 25:31.397
She took off with
a couple of her girlfriends

25:31.431 --> 25:32.598
To atlantic city.

25:32.649 --> 25:33.933
So for all i know,

25:33.984 --> 25:36.686
She could have been making out
with a tranny too.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.387
- you're a colossal pussy,
you know that?

25:38.405 --> 25:39.772
- dude, you better
come visit.

25:39.823 --> 25:40.823
I got a bunch of kids

25:40.857 --> 25:42.241
With a shitload
of hank moody stories.

25:42.276 --> 25:44.026
They don't have a face
to put to the name.

25:44.111 --> 25:45.161
- that's not good.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.029
- no, it's not.
- all right, well...

25:47.063 --> 25:48.497
Fuck it, i--

25:48.532 --> 25:49.565
I love you.
- oh, god.

25:49.583 --> 25:50.566
- i love you, zloz.

25:50.584 --> 25:52.067
- i-i--i love you too.

25:52.085 --> 25:54.287
I love you too.
fuckin' homo.

25:54.338 --> 25:55.904
- okay, faggot.

25:55.923 --> 25:58.240
Go.

25:58.258 --> 25:59.408
Hey, zloz.

25:59.426 --> 26:00.409
Made you look...

26:00.427 --> 26:02.044
At my cock.

26:02.078 --> 26:09.969
- ? you're gonna drive
some of my demons away ?

26:10.020 --> 26:10.970
? sweet ?

26:11.021 --> 26:13.606
Hey! hello!

26:13.640 --> 26:14.774
Look who's here.

26:14.808 --> 26:15.942
Hi. wow.

26:15.976 --> 26:17.276
Not even a hello.

26:17.311 --> 26:20.095
Wow, good times.

26:20.113 --> 26:22.982
Good times, good times.

26:23.033 --> 26:24.317
Hey, what are you doing?

26:24.368 --> 26:25.601
What am i, your limo driver?

26:25.619 --> 26:27.102
No, come on.
you get in the front.

26:29.606 --> 26:32.458
- what? were you just
gonna leave me behind?

26:35.212 --> 26:36.545
Hey.

26:41.918 --> 26:43.836
- merry fucking christmas.

26:43.837 --> 26:46.121
Can we go home already?

26:46.139 --> 26:47.807
Both: shut up.

26:47.841 --> 26:52.061
- ? you got all the sugar ?

26:52.095 --> 27:11.180
? you'll ever need ?
