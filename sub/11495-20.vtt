00:00.933 --> 00:03.243
<i>Previously, on...</i>

00:03.343 --> 00:04.078
H-Hello?

00:04.078 --> 00:06.346
Hey, Dad. Uh, this is
my girlfriend, Tammy.

00:06.930 --> 00:08.463
Uh, Tammy,
this is my dad Alan.

00:08.464 --> 00:09.765
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

00:09.767 --> 00:10.849
How'd you two meet?

00:10.851 --> 00:12.234
A couple of us guys
from the base

00:12.236 --> 00:14.019
went out drinking, and they
bet me a hundred bucks

00:14.021 --> 00:15.553
that I wouldn't get
this tattoo of two arms

00:15.555 --> 00:16.738
coming out of
my butt crack.

00:16.740 --> 00:18.023
Oh, Jake, you didn't.

00:18.025 --> 00:20.692
No, Tammy wouldn't let me.
Thank you for that.

00:20.694 --> 00:22.694
I took one look
at his ass and I thought,

00:22.696 --> 00:25.447
I don't want to tattoo that,
I want to <i>bite</i> that.

00:25.449 --> 00:27.366
She's old enough
to have you as her kid.

00:27.368 --> 00:28.750
So what? You are, too.

00:28.752 --> 00:30.786
I-I don't understand
why you're with Jake.

00:30.788 --> 00:33.238
The bottom line is,
I think your son is terrific.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.424
And I know what we have
isn't gonna last forever,

00:35.426 --> 00:37.542
but it's what I want
in my life right now.

00:37.544 --> 00:39.711
And I don't know when
the last time you had sex

00:39.713 --> 00:43.765
with a 19-year-old boy was,
but it is a lot of fun.

00:47.020 --> 00:48.303
What a nice surprise

00:48.305 --> 00:50.105
to have you home
for the weekend.

00:50.107 --> 00:51.640
Well, it's good
to be home.

00:51.642 --> 00:56.061
Okay. I hate to be the one
to break up this happy reunion,

00:56.063 --> 00:59.931
but you both do realize
this is not your home.

00:59.933 --> 01:02.117
He's cute.

01:02.119 --> 01:04.769
He really is, though.

01:04.771 --> 01:06.338
So, uh,
so what's going on?

01:06.340 --> 01:07.605
Anything new in the Army?

01:07.607 --> 01:08.991
Oh, did I tell you
I got promoted?

01:08.993 --> 01:10.792
I'm in charge of three
other guys in the kitchen now.

01:10.794 --> 01:12.744
Wow! My son the leader.

01:12.746 --> 01:15.113
Yeah, it's awesome.
They have to do whatever I say.

01:15.115 --> 01:18.300
I made this one guy
chug a tray of hot dog water.

01:19.786 --> 01:20.886
Uh, why would you do that?

01:20.888 --> 01:22.954
It's called
earning respect, Dad.

01:22.956 --> 01:24.339
I-I don't understand.

01:24.341 --> 01:26.475
Which part?
Earning or respect?

01:26.477 --> 01:28.844
Bazinga.

01:32.749 --> 01:34.900
Uh, it's from a TV show.

01:34.902 --> 01:37.402
So, uh, how are things
with you and Tammy?

01:37.404 --> 01:39.271
Actually, we broke up.

01:40.306 --> 01:41.823
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened?

01:41.825 --> 01:43.408
We just decided
it wasn't gonna work out.

01:43.410 --> 01:45.310
We had
unrecognizable differences.

01:45.312 --> 01:48.980
Uh, u-unrecognizable
differences?

01:48.982 --> 01:50.615
Yeah, you know,
when you can't see

01:50.617 --> 01:53.502
what the problem is, but you
just have to break up anyway.

01:55.205 --> 01:58.540
Somehow that actually
makes sense.

01:58.542 --> 02:00.008
So, are you doing okay?

02:00.010 --> 02:01.927
I know breakups can be hard.

02:01.929 --> 02:04.546
Yeah, it actually helps
to focus on my career.

02:04.548 --> 02:06.831
Get this-- one time
I made the guys

02:06.833 --> 02:09.467
stick their things in pudding.

02:12.688 --> 02:16.658
They must respect you so much.

02:17.710 --> 02:18.944
Tammy.

02:18.946 --> 02:20.445
Where the hell is he?!

02:20.447 --> 02:21.930
I assume that you're talking...

02:21.932 --> 02:24.199
Jake!

02:24.201 --> 02:25.450
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
Get back here,

02:25.452 --> 02:26.568
you son of a bitch!

02:26.570 --> 02:28.787
I am gonna kill you!

02:35.044 --> 02:38.830
I sense that he didn't
tell us everything.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.542
Let...
let go of me!

03:13.543 --> 03:14.993
Am I hurting you?
No.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.062
How about now?
Ow, ow, ow.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.680
Wait, what-what
the hell is going on?

03:18.682 --> 03:19.798
Tell them.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.201
Um, I broke up with Tammy
to see another girl.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.469
Oh, well, you know,

03:24.471 --> 03:25.887
sometimes relationships
run their course...

03:25.889 --> 03:27.172
Tell them who it was.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.306
I don't think
they really...

03:28.308 --> 03:30.375
Tell them!
Ow!

03:30.377 --> 03:32.544
It was her daughter.

03:34.263 --> 03:38.233
Wait, wait, y-you slept
with your girlfriend's daughter?

03:39.068 --> 03:40.235
Jerry Springer is taped

03:40.237 --> 03:42.571
before a live
studio audience.

03:42.573 --> 03:45.957
I trusted you to be a
good influence on Ashley.

03:45.959 --> 03:49.594
You know, it was your idea
for us to spend time together.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.330
You were supposed to be
tutoring her in math!

03:52.332 --> 03:53.765
What were you thinking?

03:55.751 --> 03:56.901
Jake tutoring math?

03:56.903 --> 03:59.204
What were <i>you</i> thinking?

03:59.206 --> 04:01.122
I figured you were gonna
find another girl someday.

04:01.124 --> 04:02.674
I just didn't
think it would be

04:02.676 --> 04:04.342
the one that came
from my uterus.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.928
I'm sorry,
it just sort of happened.

04:07.513 --> 04:08.680
Ow!

04:08.682 --> 04:11.633
Sorry, it just
sort of happened.

04:11.635 --> 04:13.184
Jake, did you even once consider

04:13.186 --> 04:14.752
that there were
other people involved?

04:14.754 --> 04:16.971
Yeah, of course. I mean,
that's what made it so hot.

04:16.974 --> 04:18.440
Her mom was in the other room.

04:18.442 --> 04:19.958
That's it,
I'm killing him!

04:19.959 --> 04:20.959
Dad! Dad!

04:20.961 --> 04:23.144
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

04:25.398 --> 04:28.066
Okay, walk me through this.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.534
Start from the beginning.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.604
Well, by all accounts,
I was a happy baby.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.823
Fast-forward.

04:34.825 --> 04:37.075
You and Tammy's daughter.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.293
How?

04:38.295 --> 04:39.628
All right.

04:39.630 --> 04:42.831
Imagine Tammy at 18,
in a string bikini,

04:42.833 --> 04:44.549
crying on your shoulder,
saying,

04:44.551 --> 04:47.052
"Why can't all guys
be like you?"

04:54.377 --> 04:55.977
Walden?

04:56.746 --> 04:59.731
Oh, sorry,
I was still imagining.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.183
It was the perfect storm.

05:02.185 --> 05:04.603
Ashley, had just broken up
with her boyfriend

05:04.605 --> 05:05.970
and Tammy was asleep.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.805
<i>I'm</i> the victim here.

05:13.913 --> 05:15.530
Okay, I...

05:15.532 --> 05:19.150
On one hand,
your behavior is despicable.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.485
On the other,

05:20.487 --> 05:23.171
the elusive mother-daughter
combo. Up top.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.875
But...

05:26.877 --> 05:28.510
last time you were
here, you were saying

05:28.512 --> 05:30.161
that Tammy was the
love of your life

05:30.163 --> 05:31.496
and you wanted
to marry her.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.999
What can I say?
I was young and naive back then.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.936
That was six
weeks ago.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.771
I never meant to hurt Tammy.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.272
I care about them both.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.226
Hey, do you think
there would ever be a chance

05:45.228 --> 05:46.778
I could
get them both together...

05:52.368 --> 05:54.185
You're adorable.

05:58.074 --> 06:00.492
What the hell
is wrong with your son?

06:00.494 --> 06:03.545
That is a question for the ages.

06:03.547 --> 06:05.880
Kind of like,
"If there really is a God,

06:05.882 --> 06:08.249
why is there so much sorrow
in the world?"

06:08.251 --> 06:09.884
or, "How have I managed

06:09.886 --> 06:12.470
to keep living in this house
all these years?"

06:12.472 --> 06:14.923
You know, I'm tempted to sleep
with you just to get back

06:14.925 --> 06:15.890
at him.

06:17.260 --> 06:20.178
Oh, well, I'm, uh,
I'm, uh, I'm flattered,

06:20.180 --> 06:21.396
but I actually...

06:21.398 --> 06:23.014
I was just kidding.

06:24.049 --> 06:26.718
How could
he do this to me?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.186
Well, you said yourself,

06:28.188 --> 06:30.739
you knew this thing with
Jake wasn't gonna last.

06:30.741 --> 06:31.723
Yeah, but there are plenty

06:31.725 --> 06:33.158
of other little skanks
in our town.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.909
Why did he have
to pick my little skank?

06:34.911 --> 06:38.947
I wish there was something that
would make you feel better.

06:38.949 --> 06:41.082
Uh, what if
Jake apologized?

06:41.084 --> 06:43.084
What if I cut his balls off?

06:43.086 --> 06:45.737
So, we've got options.

06:50.176 --> 06:51.576
All right, you two,

06:51.578 --> 06:53.445
now-now, let's, uh,
let's think of the couch

06:53.447 --> 06:56.314
as a safe place
for communication.

06:56.316 --> 07:00.185
Uh, uh, neutral corner,
neutral corner.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.771
Now, and-and this,
uh, this pillow

07:02.773 --> 07:05.690
represents the wall of respect.

07:07.943 --> 07:10.645
Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
place it between the two of you.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.531
Okay?

07:13.533 --> 07:15.233
Now, uh, Tammy, would you like

07:15.235 --> 07:17.118
to start?

07:17.120 --> 07:18.787
Hey! Hey!

07:18.789 --> 07:21.239
She hit me
with the wall of respect.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.324
And you slept with my daughter.

07:23.326 --> 07:25.059
So we'll call it even?

07:25.678 --> 07:26.795
Hey!

07:26.797 --> 07:28.580
What's going on?

07:28.582 --> 07:30.749
Oh, well,
it's complicated.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.383
Uh, remember
Jake's girlfriend Tammy?

07:32.385 --> 07:33.384
Yeah.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.587
She has
an 18-year-old daughter...

07:35.589 --> 07:37.722
And Jake nailed her.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.478
Okay, not
that complicated.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.980
Uh, Jake,
do you want to say something?

07:45.982 --> 07:47.365
All right.

07:47.367 --> 07:50.485
Uh, I'm sorry for cheating
on you with your daughter.

07:50.487 --> 07:52.270
But, I mean,

07:52.272 --> 07:54.639
when you think about it,
it's really a compliment.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.158
'Cause she's just
a much younger version of you.

08:00.831 --> 08:02.864
I'll get that.
I'll get that.

08:02.866 --> 08:04.866
I didn't know
Jake had it in him.

08:04.868 --> 08:07.919
Apparently, he's had
it in everybody.

08:09.121 --> 08:09.954
Ashley?

08:09.956 --> 08:12.323
Baby!

08:12.325 --> 08:13.958
Get your mouth off my daughter

08:13.960 --> 08:15.627
you cheating
son of a bitch!

08:15.629 --> 08:18.763
Oh, that would make
a great country song.

08:20.182 --> 08:21.683
Ashley, what are you doing here?

08:21.685 --> 08:24.719
Mom, I know you're upset
and that's why I came, but...

08:24.721 --> 08:26.271
Hey, is that my shirt?

08:26.273 --> 08:28.139
Hey, is that my boyfriend?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.507
Oh, please!

08:29.509 --> 08:31.693
Like you haven't stolen
boyfriends from me before.

08:31.695 --> 08:33.611
He was your teacher!

08:33.613 --> 08:35.864
Yeah, and thanks to you,
I failed biology.

08:35.866 --> 08:37.398
No, biology failed me!

08:38.952 --> 08:43.154
This makes me
so homesick.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.289
Come on, Mom.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.407
No, Ashley, I am
not gonna let you

08:46.409 --> 08:48.076
throw your life away
for this loser.

08:48.078 --> 08:50.245
Hey, hey, that
loser is my son.

08:50.247 --> 08:51.529
And your ex-boyfriend.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.131
Yeah, I was
just having fun.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.833
Ashley needs to think
about her future.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.701
Hey... he has
a very bright...

08:57.736 --> 09:01.256
You know what, this
is family business.

09:01.258 --> 09:02.757
You are not
the boss of me.

09:02.759 --> 09:05.310
If I want to date a
loser, then I will.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.345
Thank you.

09:07.347 --> 09:11.883
I can actually feel
my IQ dropping.

09:15.771 --> 09:17.522
Are you Jake's father?

09:17.524 --> 09:18.389
Yeah.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.224
Oh!

09:21.777 --> 09:24.779
You don't have to
pay me for today.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.282
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

09:35.480 --> 09:37.014
What the hell?

09:37.016 --> 09:38.432
Why did you hit me?

09:38.434 --> 09:40.467
Because I can't hit a kid.

09:40.469 --> 09:42.687
And your son's
messing with my Ashley.

09:42.689 --> 09:43.604
You're Ashley's dad?

09:43.606 --> 09:45.706
Ew! No!
Ew! No!

09:45.708 --> 09:47.241
I'm her boyfriend.

09:47.243 --> 09:49.243
Ew. No.
Ew. No.

09:51.330 --> 09:52.647
He's my ex-boyfriend.

09:52.649 --> 09:53.698
I'm with Jake now.

09:53.700 --> 09:56.667
Oh, come on,
I take craps bigger than him.

09:58.070 --> 10:01.923
Takes me an hour and a half,
but I do it.

10:01.925 --> 10:03.624
What are you
doing here, Jerry?

10:03.626 --> 10:05.126
Whoa, Jerry?

10:05.877 --> 10:08.045
From Jerry's Cadillac
in Tustin?

10:08.047 --> 10:09.213
That's right, son.

10:09.215 --> 10:10.848
No credit, no problem.

10:10.850 --> 10:11.933
Really?

10:11.935 --> 10:14.218
"Want a Caddy, I'm your Daddy."

10:14.220 --> 10:16.020
I want a daddy.

10:20.225 --> 10:22.109
I want you back, Ashley.

10:22.111 --> 10:24.195
Whatever.
Too little, too late, Jer-Bear.

10:24.197 --> 10:25.696
Yeah, Jer-Bear.

10:26.949 --> 10:28.866
You know, it's like that
old song: "If you liked it,

10:28.868 --> 10:30.418
then you should've put
a ring on it."

10:30.420 --> 10:32.470
Well, I bought you a belly ring.

10:32.472 --> 10:34.071
Oh, that was you?

10:34.073 --> 10:37.208
I chipped my tooth
on that thing.

10:37.210 --> 10:39.026
Uh, just out of curiosity,

10:39.028 --> 10:42.296
how did you meet
Hannah Montana here?

10:43.382 --> 10:44.915
It's actually a cute story.

10:44.917 --> 10:46.467
We were shooting a commercial

10:46.469 --> 10:48.836
for our Fourth of July
Savings Spectacular.

10:48.838 --> 10:50.338
I was dressed as Uncle Sam,

10:50.340 --> 10:52.473
with a row of pretty girls
behind me

10:52.475 --> 10:54.508
wearing bikinis
and waving sparklers.

10:54.510 --> 10:56.143
I took one look at Ashley,

10:56.145 --> 11:00.097
pointed at her and said,
"Uncle Sam wants <i>you."</i>

11:01.850 --> 11:04.101
That is a cute story.

11:04.103 --> 11:07.321
Fireworks went off in
my pants that night.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.442
Okay, not so
cute anymore.

11:11.444 --> 11:14.278
I mean, how can you not love
a girl like this?

11:14.280 --> 11:16.664
She's smart, she's funny,
and she's got a better body

11:16.666 --> 11:19.733
than the new SRX Crossover.
Don't you, darling?

11:19.735 --> 11:22.053
Don't "darling" me. You had
your chance and you blew it.

11:22.055 --> 11:24.705
Oh, come on, Ashley.
I've been married four times.

11:24.707 --> 11:26.791
And you know
why they didn't work.

11:26.793 --> 11:28.209
I got a mistress,

11:28.211 --> 11:32.463
and her name
is Customer Satisfaction.

11:32.465 --> 11:33.964
All right.

11:33.966 --> 11:36.550
Look, Jerry, if my little girl
doesn't want to see you,

11:36.552 --> 11:37.751
then you got to go.

11:37.753 --> 11:40.354
Thanks, Mom.
Shut up.

11:41.223 --> 11:43.257
Okay.

11:43.259 --> 11:45.559
It takes two
to make a deal.

11:45.561 --> 11:48.229
But know this, Ashley:

11:48.231 --> 11:51.982
I guarantee
I will always love you.

11:51.984 --> 11:56.537
Just like I guarantee
no one can beat my prices.

12:02.411 --> 12:06.280
♪ If you need a set of wheels,
Jerry's making super deals ♪

12:06.282 --> 12:11.252
♪ At Jerry's Cadillac. ♪

12:15.290 --> 12:17.224
Oh, come on.
It's catchy.

12:21.796 --> 12:24.398
God, I've failed
as a parent.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.483
No.

12:25.485 --> 12:26.984
Yeah.

12:26.986 --> 12:29.820
Maybe.

12:29.822 --> 12:32.823
My beautiful young daughter
has narrowed her choices down

12:32.825 --> 12:37.445
to a 19-year-old who needs
to ask the Wizard for a brain

12:37.447 --> 12:39.029
and a sleazy car salesman

12:39.031 --> 12:43.167
who barely escaped
a <i>Dateline</i> special.

12:43.169 --> 12:45.703
O-Okay, so it's not
an ideal situation,

12:45.705 --> 12:47.671
but... what is?

12:47.673 --> 12:49.373
Sometimes kids
make mistakes.

12:49.375 --> 12:51.926
Yeah, sometimes kids
are mistakes.

12:53.595 --> 12:55.179
Well, look,
when I was a kid,

12:55.181 --> 12:57.498
I made a lot of choices
my parents didn't agree with.

12:57.500 --> 13:00.601
Like dropping out of M.I.T.,
and that turned out great.

13:01.637 --> 13:02.853
Somehow I don't think

13:02.855 --> 13:05.506
Ashley's on the road
to incredible wealth.

13:05.508 --> 13:07.691
She's more on the road

13:07.693 --> 13:11.028
to antibiotic-resistant
gonorrhea.

13:13.031 --> 13:15.116
Wow.

13:15.118 --> 13:17.568
That's... just...

13:17.570 --> 13:20.287
Wow.

13:21.123 --> 13:23.190
When is it gonna stop?

13:23.192 --> 13:24.909
When's what gonna stop?

13:24.911 --> 13:26.127
The taking.

13:26.129 --> 13:28.546
I mean, that's all
kids ever do.

13:28.548 --> 13:31.048
I mean, first they
take over your body

13:31.050 --> 13:33.384
like a little parasite.

13:33.386 --> 13:36.703
And then they trash your
fun zone on the way out.

13:39.674 --> 13:41.592
Then they suck your boobs
until your nipples

13:41.594 --> 13:44.711
look like the worn-out thumb
on a work glove.

13:46.598 --> 13:49.483
You do paint a picture
with your words.

13:50.502 --> 13:52.886
And then it
gets really bad.

13:52.888 --> 13:56.157
They take your
sleep, your time,

13:56.159 --> 13:59.610
your favorite dress,
keys to your car,

13:59.612 --> 14:01.862
the weed you had hidden
in a cowboy boot

14:01.864 --> 14:04.281
in the back of
your closet.

14:04.283 --> 14:06.500
Leave it up to my daughter
to go the extra mile

14:06.502 --> 14:07.734
and take my boyfriend.

14:07.736 --> 14:10.120
And you know
why you keep giving?

14:10.122 --> 14:12.790
Because I'm a glutton
for punishment?

14:12.792 --> 14:15.342
Because you love her, and
you want what's best for her.

14:15.344 --> 14:17.411
I suppose.

14:17.413 --> 14:20.130
Okay, let me ask you this:
were you happy with Jake?

14:20.132 --> 14:21.582
I mean, you know,

14:21.584 --> 14:24.385
before he started
climbing the family tree.

14:26.254 --> 14:28.889
Honestly, Jake's
a great guy.

14:28.891 --> 14:31.775
So isn't it possible

14:31.777 --> 14:34.895
that he may also be a great guy
for your daughter?

14:34.897 --> 14:36.063
No.

14:36.065 --> 14:37.565
Yes.

14:37.567 --> 14:38.732
Maybe.

14:41.469 --> 14:44.788
Really? The thumb
on a work glove?

14:44.790 --> 14:46.790
Oh, honey, that was
two boob jobs ago.

14:46.792 --> 14:50.077
These puppies can
cut glass now.

hit you, Dad.

15:01.958 --> 15:04.091
So am I.

15:04.093 --> 15:06.260
Yeah, what was that about?
I mean, he won't hit a kid,

15:06.262 --> 15:08.962
but he'll hit somebody
way older than him?

15:09.797 --> 15:11.131
What?

15:11.133 --> 15:13.801
I said, "He won't hit a kid,

15:13.803 --> 15:17.354
but he'll hit someone
way older than him!"

15:18.790 --> 15:20.274
Hey.

15:24.614 --> 15:26.980
I have something
I want to say to you two.

15:26.982 --> 15:28.332
Don't care.

15:28.334 --> 15:31.452
I swear to God, Ashley, I paid
to get those teeth straight,

15:31.454 --> 15:32.786
I will crooked 'em up again!

15:32.788 --> 15:34.572
Up-bup-bup-bup.

15:34.574 --> 15:37.157
Eye on the ball, Tammy.
Eye on the ball.

15:39.511 --> 15:42.179
If you two want
to be with each other,

15:42.181 --> 15:44.265
I am not gonna stand
in your way.

15:44.267 --> 15:45.282
Really?

15:45.284 --> 15:47.017
If you think you can
be happy together,

15:47.019 --> 15:48.168
then be happy together.

15:48.170 --> 15:50.254
Wow. Thank you, Tammy.

15:50.256 --> 15:53.107
I... guess I just
hope Ashley and I

15:53.109 --> 15:56.110
can be as happy as
you and I were.

15:59.281 --> 16:00.981
Stop talking.

16:02.851 --> 16:05.202
But I already am happy,
Jake-Bear.

16:05.204 --> 16:07.521
Give me some sugar.

16:08.990 --> 16:12.192
This is the oddest family moment
I have ever witnessed.

16:15.747 --> 16:17.831
Maybe I should
grease up a pig

16:17.833 --> 16:20.217
in case they want
to wrestle later.

16:23.555 --> 16:24.505
Jerry.

16:24.507 --> 16:26.640
I feel bad about before,

16:26.642 --> 16:30.477
so I brought you an official
Jerry's Cadillac beer koozie.

16:32.397 --> 16:34.014
I told you, it's over.

16:34.016 --> 16:36.066
You did.

16:36.068 --> 16:38.051
But I'm driving home

16:38.053 --> 16:41.054
in my limited edition
Escalade...

16:44.659 --> 16:46.610
...when it hits me.

16:46.612 --> 16:49.863
If I've learned one thing
in my 25 years

16:49.865 --> 16:52.249
as Orange County's
number one dealer

16:52.251 --> 16:54.201
of premium
luxury vehicles,

16:54.203 --> 16:57.004
it's that you don't take no
for an answer.

16:57.006 --> 16:59.673
God, this guy's good.

16:59.675 --> 17:02.259
So I came back here
to ask you just

17:02.261 --> 17:03.477
one question.

17:05.865 --> 17:09.415
What's it gonna take to get you
into my life today?

17:10.468 --> 17:12.435
Oh, my God,
look at the size of that rock.

17:12.438 --> 17:15.689
Dude, you can't buy her love
with a diamond ring.

17:15.691 --> 17:17.441
But wait, there's more.

17:19.611 --> 17:23.763
My manager's gonna kill me,
but if you say yes right now...

17:25.650 --> 17:29.286
...I will throw in a 2012
powder blue Mercedes SL

17:29.288 --> 17:31.872
I just bought
at a police auction.

17:33.541 --> 17:35.442
I don't know what to do.

17:35.444 --> 17:38.779
Take the car!

17:38.781 --> 17:39.880
Dad!

17:39.882 --> 17:41.782
It's a Mercedes.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.385
We got a deal, Ashley?

17:44.387 --> 17:46.553
Sold!

17:46.555 --> 17:49.256
Aw...

17:49.258 --> 17:51.508
Ew!

17:51.510 --> 17:54.127
I love these people.

17:54.129 --> 17:56.430
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

18:06.898 --> 18:08.548
Jake?

18:11.018 --> 18:12.718
Doing okay?

18:12.720 --> 18:14.320
I guess.

18:14.322 --> 18:17.039
I really screwed things up
this time, didn't I?

18:17.041 --> 18:18.724
Well...

18:18.726 --> 18:21.727
you certainly screwed
everything you could.

18:21.729 --> 18:23.763
I mean, I had
such a good thing going--

18:23.765 --> 18:25.932
first with Tammy
and then Ashley---

18:25.934 --> 18:28.301
and now I'm all alone.

18:28.303 --> 18:30.236
That's because you're a Harper.

18:30.238 --> 18:31.654
It's what we do.

18:31.656 --> 18:34.907
We take something good
and turn it into nothing.

18:35.776 --> 18:37.643
I don't like being a Harper.

18:37.645 --> 18:39.562
Nobody does, son.

18:39.564 --> 18:41.730
Nobody does.

18:47.704 --> 18:49.338
What a day, huh?

18:49.340 --> 18:50.873
Yeah.

18:50.875 --> 18:52.458
Sorry about all the trouble.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.110
Oh. You kidding me?

18:54.112 --> 18:56.462
Jerry sold me an Escalade
at dealer cost.

18:56.464 --> 18:59.382
Oh, honey, you didn't
fall for that, did you?

19:00.250 --> 19:03.185
He really is the king,
isn't he?

19:04.021 --> 19:06.439
And my daughter gets
to be the queen.

19:06.441 --> 19:09.308
It's a white trash fairy tale.

19:09.310 --> 19:11.277
Hey. Let's talk
about something happier.

19:11.279 --> 19:13.362
Remember when Alan
got punched in the face?

19:13.364 --> 19:16.599
Yeah. That was awesome.

19:17.784 --> 19:20.119
Mmm.

19:20.121 --> 19:22.538
You know, the older I get,

19:22.540 --> 19:25.291
the less I understand
about relationships.

19:25.293 --> 19:27.577
Me, too. I'm like a blind man

19:27.579 --> 19:30.062
trying to get out
of a doorknob factory.

19:30.064 --> 19:32.798
I mean, how is
that possible?

19:32.800 --> 19:35.668
I mean, you're handsome
and smart and charming...

19:35.670 --> 19:37.620
You're embarrassing me.

19:37.622 --> 19:39.672
Go on.

19:39.674 --> 19:41.641
I mean, you got
the whole package.

19:41.643 --> 19:43.342
Well, you do, too.

19:43.344 --> 19:45.611
I mean, you're beautiful,
you're independent,

19:45.613 --> 19:47.096
you're intelligent...

19:47.098 --> 19:48.397
Oh, stop.

19:50.267 --> 19:52.902
Well, don't
actually stop.

19:52.904 --> 19:54.937
You're funny.

19:56.506 --> 19:57.506
You're...

19:58.775 --> 20:02.478
...really, really
beautiful.

20:12.155 --> 20:14.123
Okay, that probably
wasn't a good idea.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.325
Definitely not.

20:19.858 --> 20:21.692
Berta's gonna love this.
