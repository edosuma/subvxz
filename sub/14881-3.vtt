<i>What?</i>

01:28.521 --> 01:31.624
<i>I just don't understand, like,
why is it such a problem</i>

01:31.691 --> 01:33.460
<i>when you guys were barely even married?</i>

01:44.904 --> 01:46.072
It's sad.

02:07.827 --> 02:11.231
<i>I feel bad that you have
to go through this with him.</i>

02:11.297 --> 02:13.566
<i>You just are going to have to ride it out.</i>

02:13.633 --> 02:15.435
<i>So, don't dwell on this. Let's have fun.</i>

02:15.502 --> 02:18.771
<i>You have got to just do some silly,
and outrageous, like, kooky things</i>

02:18.838 --> 02:21.107
<i>that will, like, take your mind off
of this kind of stuff.</i>

02:21.174 --> 02:24.644
<i>We have amazing lives,
so let's enjoy it and have fun.</i>

02:24.711 --> 02:25.945
<i>Who cares?</i>

02:27.046 --> 02:28.348
<i>I love you.</i>

03:16.563 --> 03:18.464
<i>Hey, Rob, how's the house-hunting going?</i>

25:01.933 --> 25:03.902
See, that's what really bothers me.

25:04.636 --> 25:08.373
I mean, you know, for the last 21 years,
I've been in Rob's life,

25:08.440 --> 25:09.741
and I get this all the time.

25:09.808 --> 25:11.710
It's like you're never appreciated
for what you do.

25:11.776 --> 25:15.113
I offered my services to help him
find a house,

25:15.180 --> 25:18.216
and then he comes and dumps it on
that he has got no male figure?
