00:29.142 --> 00:32.142
Yeah!

00:32.302 --> 00:34.424
â™ª 50 can't you hear me screaming?

00:36.542 --> 00:38.581
Tom. Get you another one?
Hm.

00:38.582 --> 00:41.221
Same again? So your eldest
still at uni, then?

00:41.222 --> 00:42.941
Yeah and costing me a packet.

00:42.942 --> 00:45.942
Sorry, Mitch, but, er...
it's two minutes past time.

00:47.142 --> 00:48.981
My customers are still drinking.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.982
Rules are rules.

00:52.422 --> 00:54.015
Sorry, Tom.

01:00.502 --> 01:03.502
Time to drink up now, folks!

01:09.302 --> 01:11.501
Calling all units.
Calling all units.

01:11.502 --> 01:14.502
This is a Code Red.
Code Red at Colton's Butchers.

01:15.502 --> 01:17.901
Calling all units.
This is a Code Red.

01:17.902 --> 01:20.902
I repeat. This is a Code Red.

01:22.422 --> 01:24.061
Did you hear that?
I did indeed.

01:24.062 --> 01:27.062
Everybody, follow me.

01:27.422 --> 01:29.061
Code Red at Colton's Butchers.

01:29.062 --> 01:31.941
I repeat, Code Red.

01:31.942 --> 01:34.941
What's the emergency, Azeem?
Angus's shop is unlocked.

01:34.942 --> 01:36.821
Hardly cause for a Code Red.

01:36.822 --> 01:38.461
More like a Code Yellow.

01:38.462 --> 01:41.421
It might be the burglar.
It might just be Angus.

01:41.422 --> 01:44.422
Did you actually check inside?

01:57.862 --> 02:00.862
Angus?
Angus?

02:14.102 --> 02:17.102
Angus?

02:19.182 --> 02:22.182
What's that?

02:25.822 --> 02:28.822
Freezer.

03:35.862 --> 03:38.862
Angus is dead.

03:40.222 --> 03:43.222
Unit 3 to HQ.
Unit 3 calling HQ.

03:44.582 --> 03:46.381
HQ receiving. Over.

03:46.382 --> 03:49.141
Angus Colton. 44 years old.

03:49.142 --> 03:52.142
Found dead in his butcher's shop
in the village of Bleakridge.

03:53.342 --> 03:54.981
We're heading for
bandit country.

03:54.982 --> 03:56.461
Sir?

03:56.462 --> 03:59.462
Bleakridge. The most remote
village in Midsomer,

03:59.622 --> 04:02.381
surrounded by moorland.
Sounds like a horror movie.

04:02.382 --> 04:04.141
It was a scary place for a while.

04:04.142 --> 04:06.621
Crime rate was unusually high
for a small village.

04:06.622 --> 04:09.622
It had a reputation for being
lawless until two years ago.

04:11.422 --> 04:13.341
Problem was location.

04:13.342 --> 04:15.021
The village was so far out,

04:15.022 --> 04:17.380
it took our lot too long
to respond to calls.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.421
By the time we turned up,
the damage was done.

04:19.422 --> 04:20.940
I'm assuming word got out?

04:20.942 --> 04:23.942
Oh, they flocked here - burglars,
car thieves,

04:23.982 --> 04:26.901
joy riders, fly tippers.

04:26.902 --> 04:29.902
Gangster's paradise, sir.

04:30.342 --> 04:31.741
Mm...

04:31.742 --> 04:34.501
Stand back, please.

04:34.502 --> 04:37.461
That's it, if you can keep back,
please, ladies and gentlemen.

04:37.462 --> 04:39.501
Thank you very much.

04:39.502 --> 04:41.341
So what changed?

04:41.342 --> 04:44.181
You said the village was lawless
until two years ago.

04:44.182 --> 04:46.221
What changed?

04:46.222 --> 04:49.222
They formed a Watch.

04:52.102 --> 04:55.102
What can you tell us?
I can tell you I'm freezing.

04:55.742 --> 04:58.742
We're looking at blunt-force
trauma to the back of the skull.

04:58.782 --> 05:01.061
One blow, with considerable force.

05:01.062 --> 05:03.101
His attacker came from behind?

05:03.102 --> 05:05.941
We found blood splatter
on the floor behind you.

05:05.942 --> 05:08.301
Looks likely that he was
attacked out there

05:08.302 --> 05:09.861
and dragged in here.

05:09.862 --> 05:11.701
Murder weapon?
We're still looking.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.141
Time of death?

05:13.142 --> 05:16.142
That's usually determined by
measuring body temperature.

05:16.302 --> 05:19.302
So, him being in a freezer...
Doesn't help, no.

05:21.262 --> 05:22.741
No forced access?

05:22.742 --> 05:25.061
The door was closed, but unlocked.

05:25.062 --> 05:28.062
Any other employees?
This is a one-man operation.

05:30.782 --> 05:32.501
Who found the body?

05:32.502 --> 05:35.502
Iwas on patrol,
checking business premises,

05:35.542 --> 05:37.621
and then I saw
the door was unlocked.

05:37.622 --> 05:40.622
Did you go inside?
No. Ijust put out the Code Red.

05:41.262 --> 05:44.262
Code Red?
It's standard Watch protocol.

05:44.382 --> 05:46.741
All serious incidents are
assigned a colour

05:46.742 --> 05:48.301
depending on their severity.

05:48.302 --> 05:50.861
Code Red being the most severe.

05:50.862 --> 05:53.061
It means there's
a serious crime in progress

05:53.062 --> 05:56.021
and urgent assistance
is required.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.861
Did you know Angus Colton?

05:57.862 --> 05:59.741
He was a stout fellow.

05:59.742 --> 06:01.621
And a more than adequate butcher.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.341
And our deputy co-ordinator.

06:04.342 --> 06:07.061
Wait. You're saying Angus Colton was
a member of the Watch?

06:07.062 --> 06:09.221
He was a founding member,
no less.

06:09.222 --> 06:10.901
Does Mr Colton have any family?

06:10.902 --> 06:13.902
A sister, Maxine and a niece, Tara.

06:14.982 --> 06:16.741
And where would we find them?

06:16.742 --> 06:19.101
At Angus's house, across the green.

06:19.102 --> 06:21.821
They've been living with him
for the past two years.

06:21.822 --> 06:24.621
Ever since the husband Frank died.

06:24.622 --> 06:27.622
Who would want to kill Angus?

06:28.222 --> 06:31.222
He never hurt anyone.

06:31.422 --> 06:34.422
When did you last see him?

06:34.542 --> 06:37.141
Yesterday morning?
We had breakfast around nine,

06:37.142 --> 06:39.181
then Uncle Angus
went over to the shop.

06:39.182 --> 06:42.061
And how was he before he left?

06:42.062 --> 06:45.062
Same old Angus. He's like
a bear with a sore head.

06:47.942 --> 06:50.741
Can either of you think of anyone
who might want to harm him?

06:50.742 --> 06:53.742
No. No. He was well liked.

06:53.822 --> 06:56.822
Was he anxious about anything
in the past few weeks? Worried?

06:58.222 --> 07:01.222
Was he anxious about anything
No. He was too focused on the case.

07:02.662 --> 07:05.662
The case?

07:12.382 --> 07:15.382
What is all this?
Uncle Angus's big project.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.061
He's investigating
the burglaries.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.941
What burglaries?
The village has been targeted.

07:20.942 --> 07:23.942
There's been five break-ins
in the last month.

07:25.142 --> 07:27.541
Aunt Ingrid's
very worried about it.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.901
Aunt Ingrid?
My sister-in-law.

07:29.902 --> 07:32.902
Ingrid Lockston. She's
the co-ordinator of the Watch.

07:33.302 --> 07:34.901
She asked Uncle Angus
to find out

07:34.902 --> 07:36.501
who was behind the burglaries.

07:36.502 --> 07:38.181
He was becoming
obsessed by them.

07:38.182 --> 07:41.182
He wasn't obsessed!

07:41.622 --> 07:44.301
He just didn't want
to let her down.

07:44.302 --> 07:46.301
Aunt Ingrid's pretty cool.

07:46.302 --> 07:49.302
And did your brother find out
who was behind the burglaries?

07:49.822 --> 07:52.822
Well, if he did,
he didn't tell us.

07:59.102 --> 08:01.741
I want everything in that study
logged for the record.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.421
You think Angus
found his burglar?

08:03.422 --> 08:06.422
Or maybe the burglar found him.

08:20.862 --> 08:23.862
What are we doing here?

08:27.142 --> 08:30.142
I said: What are we doing here?
Just curious, that's all.

08:33.462 --> 08:36.462
Well, can we be curious
somewhere else?

09:01.142 --> 09:03.541
Something I can help you with?

09:03.542 --> 09:06.542
We're looking for Ingrid Lockston.

09:07.022 --> 09:10.022
Come in.

09:15.022 --> 09:18.022
Police are here.

09:29.422 --> 09:32.422
DCI Barnaby and DS Winter, correct?

09:33.262 --> 09:35.621
Indeed.
Ingrid Lockston.

09:35.622 --> 09:38.622
I'm the co-ordinator of
the Bleakridge Watch.

09:39.022 --> 09:41.181
We've heard the news about Angus.

09:41.182 --> 09:44.182
We're all simply stunned.
Are you sure he was murdered?

09:45.702 --> 09:48.702
I'm afraid so.
How well did you know Mr Colton?

09:48.822 --> 09:50.901
Well, we were related.

09:50.902 --> 09:53.902
His sister was married to
my late brother, Frank.

09:55.342 --> 09:58.221
In fact,
Angus helped me set up the Watch

09:58.222 --> 10:00.701
in the aftermath of Frank's murder.

10:00.702 --> 10:03.702
Your brother was murdered?

10:05.822 --> 10:08.822
He was the victim of
a hit-and-run, two years ago.

10:09.182 --> 10:11.581
Left to die on the roadside.

10:11.582 --> 10:14.141
The driver was never caught.

10:14.142 --> 10:17.142
Back in the day, the village
was a haven for joy riders,

10:17.462 --> 10:20.381
so it was assumed that
one of those was responsible.

10:20.382 --> 10:23.382
Scumbags, the lot of 'em.

10:23.462 --> 10:26.101
Quite.

10:26.102 --> 10:28.261
Frank's death was the final straw.

10:28.262 --> 10:30.861
We decided to clean up our village

10:30.862 --> 10:33.621
and so we formed the Watch.

10:33.622 --> 10:35.461
When did you last speak to Angus?

10:35.462 --> 10:37.221
Yesterday morning.

10:37.222 --> 10:39.301
He called to update me
on a special case

10:39.302 --> 10:42.302
I'd asked him to look into.
The er... burglaries?

10:42.502 --> 10:45.502
An unfortunate development.
And what was his update?

10:46.142 --> 10:47.861
No closer to catching the culprit,

10:47.862 --> 10:50.021
but he did believe they were local.

10:50.022 --> 10:52.381
You should speak to
Mitch McAllister.

10:52.382 --> 10:54.381
Had it in for Angus for months.

10:54.457 --> 10:57.710
Who's Mitch McAllister?
He's the owner of The Gallows.

10:58.182 --> 11:01.182
He assaulted Angus,
kicked him out of his pub.

11:02.582 --> 11:05.582
Adrian, it's time for your patrol.

11:12.262 --> 11:15.262
You'll have to excuse him.
He can be hot-headed sometimes.

11:16.302 --> 11:18.661
Tell me about Mitch McAllister.

11:18.662 --> 11:21.662
Well, unfortunately, there are
some people in the village

11:22.102 --> 11:25.102
who don't appreciate
what the Watch does.

11:25.382 --> 11:27.821
Some of them, including Mitch,

11:27.822 --> 11:30.822
think we... interfere too much.

11:45.742 --> 11:48.742
Now, Iwouldn't normally condone
drinking this early in the morning,

11:49.742 --> 11:52.742
but my darling wife has finally
been recognised for her good deeds.

11:54.502 --> 11:57.101
So, I'm happy to make an exception.

11:57.102 --> 11:59.981
That's very big of you, Duncan.

11:59.982 --> 12:02.141
Would you like to say a few words,
Barbara?

12:02.142 --> 12:04.101
Oh, er... yes.

12:04.102 --> 12:07.907
Er... Well, erm... a pat
on the back from the council

12:08.022 --> 12:09.701
is hardly a success.

12:09.702 --> 12:12.702
But it's nice they recognise
the importance of the cafe.

12:13.662 --> 12:16.461
Even though they have refused
to fund us all these years!

12:16.462 --> 12:19.462
So we won't rest on our laurels.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.341
Erm, there's still work to be done.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.342
Cafe opens in an hour.
So... that's your last!

12:28.422 --> 12:31.422
Can I take
a couple more photos, please?

12:32.142 --> 12:34.461
We're looking for Mitch McAllister.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.462
Er, yeah. That's me.

12:37.902 --> 12:40.621
DCI Barnaby. DS Winter.

12:40.622 --> 12:43.622
We need to speak with you
about Angus Colton.

12:44.822 --> 12:46.541
What's he been saying now?

12:46.815 --> 12:49.815
Not much. He's dead.

12:52.262 --> 12:55.262
OK, I barred Colton. So what?

12:56.222 --> 12:58.381
It sounds like things got physical.

12:58.382 --> 13:01.261
He refused to leave, so I got
hold of him and threw him out.

13:01.262 --> 13:04.141
It was a scuffle, nothing more.
Why did you bar him?

13:04.142 --> 13:07.142
Colton and that Watch lot,
they're a pain in our neck.

13:08.782 --> 13:10.821
Every time we do something
to make money,

13:10.822 --> 13:13.822
they object to it.
Late licence. Beer garden.

13:14.102 --> 13:16.141
Live music. Comedy night.
You name it.

13:16.142 --> 13:17.781
They want to prevent crime,

13:17.782 --> 13:20.782
but really they want to run this
village the way they see fit.

13:21.302 --> 13:24.061
If you try to complain,
they start targeting you.

13:24.062 --> 13:25.501
Targeting you in what way?

13:25.502 --> 13:28.502
Well, it starts with parking
tickets and speeding fines.

13:29.222 --> 13:31.061
Then they report you
to the council

13:31.062 --> 13:34.062
for petty things like bins,
hedges, noise.

13:34.262 --> 13:37.021
Meanwhile, them and their mates
do whatever they like.

13:37.022 --> 13:39.141
Probably that lot
that killed Colton.

13:39.142 --> 13:40.781
What makes you say that?

13:40.782 --> 13:43.782
They're the only ones round here
who can get away with it.

13:47.142 --> 13:50.142
Every Watch group should have
a police point of contact, yes?

13:50.582 --> 13:53.582
Community liaison usually.

13:58.702 --> 14:00.981
Find out who deals with the Watch.

14:00.982 --> 14:03.982
Let's get some background on them.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.061
We should've called ahead.

14:08.062 --> 14:11.062
Tara, where are you going?
Meeting Aunt Ingrid.

14:11.622 --> 14:14.622
Excuse me.

14:18.462 --> 14:21.462
We came as soon as we heard.

14:23.142 --> 14:25.101
Come on.
We'll make you a cup of tea.

14:25.102 --> 14:28.102
Hi.

14:29.262 --> 14:32.262
Yeah. Ijust need to get away.

14:33.342 --> 14:36.342
Who's that coming to see us?

14:39.302 --> 14:40.821
Oh, hello, you!
Hi!

14:40.822 --> 14:43.822
On my way back to the lab, but
john asked me to drop in these.

14:43.902 --> 14:46.261
Preliminary notes from today.

14:46.262 --> 14:48.981
Aw! How's Paddy settling in?
Hello!

14:48.982 --> 14:51.982
Betty adores him. And so do we.

14:52.502 --> 14:54.861
More importantly,
how's jamie settling in?

14:54.862 --> 14:57.862
Oh, cocky, irritating.
Same old Winter.

14:58.302 --> 15:01.302
I didn't realise you two
knew each other.

15:02.222 --> 15:05.222
We don't. But we have met before.

15:06.262 --> 15:09.181
A training course in
crime scene management.

15:09.182 --> 15:11.781
We both attended.
At the same time.

15:11.782 --> 15:14.301
It was in Dorset.

15:14.302 --> 15:17.302
But we got to talking,
mostly about work.

15:18.102 --> 15:21.102
Pretty dull, really.
Yeah, sounds it.

15:22.142 --> 15:23.741
So, we know each other.

15:23.742 --> 15:26.742
But it's not like
we're friends or anything.

15:27.262 --> 15:30.262
No. Certainly not friends.

15:31.342 --> 15:34.061
So... I should probably...

15:34.062 --> 15:37.062
The lab?
Yes, the lab.

15:37.262 --> 15:40.262
I should be there.

15:41.022 --> 15:44.022
Bye. See you.

15:44.662 --> 15:47.662
Yeah. Very strange indeed.

16:37.283 --> 16:37.392
â™ªâ™ª

16:40.042 --> 16:42.401
I can't give you
an exact time of death.

16:42.414 --> 16:45.897
As for cause, he sustained
a depressed skull fracture

16:45.922 --> 16:48.041
resulting in
an intracranial haemorrhage.

16:48.042 --> 16:49.721
Anything on the murder weapon?

16:49.722 --> 16:51.881
We're going with
a meat tenderiser.

16:51.882 --> 16:54.882
We found lattice-shaped markings
around the wound

16:55.002 --> 16:58.002
that correspond to the pattern
found... on one of these.

17:00.682 --> 17:03.682
And an inventory of the shop
showed a tenderiser was missing.

17:04.082 --> 17:05.881
What about prints? DNA?

17:05.882 --> 17:08.882
I've sent samples to the lab.
Should hear back in a day or so.

17:09.321 --> 17:12.321
However, there is one thing you
might want to take a look at.

17:13.842 --> 17:16.842
We found these on his ankles.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.800
Restraining injuries?

17:18.801 --> 17:21.801
Found similar ones...
on his wrists.

17:22.561 --> 17:24.521
The killer tied him up?

17:24.521 --> 17:26.881
No. I don't think these are
linked to his murder.

17:26.882 --> 17:29.882
No. I don't think these are
These are older wounds.

17:37.962 --> 17:39.801
His socks were too tight?

17:39.802 --> 17:42.802
Kam thinks Angus Colton
was restrained at some point

17:43.042 --> 17:44.801
during the last month.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.761
Oh, I asked Community Liaison

17:46.762 --> 17:48.801
for a report on
the Bleakridge Watch.

17:48.802 --> 17:51.601
What's the story?
A pretty effective outfit.

17:51.602 --> 17:54.041
Since Ingrid Lockston and Colton
set up the Watch,

17:54.042 --> 17:56.401
the crime rate
has dropped almost 80%.

17:56.402 --> 17:58.241
The crime rate
An impressive record.

17:58.242 --> 18:00.881
The recent break-ins
have taken the shine off.

18:00.882 --> 18:03.481
Colton was on the case,
but wasn't getting far with it.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.921
He didn't make any headway?
Sort of.

18:05.922 --> 18:07.801
The last break-in
was two weeks ago

18:07.802 --> 18:10.802
at the home of Watch
members Felix and Cecily Hope.

18:11.322 --> 18:14.322
Colton found a shoe print
in the back garden.

18:17.122 --> 18:19.041
Size 10. Left training shoe

18:19.042 --> 18:21.521
with distinctive
vertical markings.

18:21.522 --> 18:23.881
What about Colton's
communications?

18:23.882 --> 18:25.801
We're still going through
his e-mails,

18:25.802 --> 18:28.802
but... his call history
is interesting.

18:29.522 --> 18:31.881
The last call he made
was to Azeem Meer.

18:31.882 --> 18:34.882
Meer was a Watch member
that discovered Colton's body.

18:35.002 --> 18:38.002
What was so interesting?
Colton made it at 5:00am.

18:39.922 --> 18:42.241
Also, we've traced
the last transaction

18:42.242 --> 18:44.081
from Colton's butcher's shop.

18:44.082 --> 18:47.082
A debit card belonging to
a Henry Marsh.

18:48.402 --> 18:51.402
Henry Marsh once served 12
months for aggravated robbery.

18:53.322 --> 18:55.201
Hm...

18:55.202 --> 18:57.361
Are you sure about this, Henry?

18:57.362 --> 18:59.521
I mean, I get it.

18:59.522 --> 19:02.522
You wanna play Mr Regular job
for a while. Good for you.

19:02.722 --> 19:05.281
At some point you're going to
have to face the facts.

19:05.282 --> 19:07.681
A regular job doesn't pay
that well, you know.

19:07.682 --> 19:10.321
It will when we've got clients.

19:10.322 --> 19:12.521
And who's gonna want
to employ us?

19:12.522 --> 19:15.522
Have a little faith, brother.

19:16.282 --> 19:18.681
It's just, it's...
It's not who we are, Henry.

19:29.282 --> 19:30.881
That is your debit card?

19:30.882 --> 19:33.241
Yeah.
But I wasn't in Angus's shop.

19:33.242 --> 19:36.242
Was your card stolen?

19:39.362 --> 19:42.362
Not stolen, then.

19:43.602 --> 19:46.602
Jensen! Get in here!

19:50.202 --> 19:52.401
Everything all right?
Use my card recently?

19:52.402 --> 19:55.402
What card?
Bank card.

19:56.122 --> 19:57.801
Yeah, come to think of it.

19:57.802 --> 20:00.121
A few days ago for the shopping.

20:00.122 --> 20:02.841
You go down Colton's butcher's?

20:02.842 --> 20:04.481
Fancied a couple of steaks.

20:04.482 --> 20:06.321
Did you speak to Angus Colton?

20:06.322 --> 20:09.322
Not really, no.
He seemed a bit distracted.

20:09.482 --> 20:12.361
By what?
That woman from the pub.

20:12.362 --> 20:15.362
What's her name? Lena, is it?

20:15.642 --> 20:18.642
She came in just after me and she
seemed desperate to talk to him.

20:30.482 --> 20:33.482
Er, sorry, Ingrid,
we're not open yet.

20:39.682 --> 20:41.841
Tara said you'd be here.

20:41.842 --> 20:44.121
I can't believe you came to work.

20:44.122 --> 20:46.521
Well, it's best to keep busy.

20:46.522 --> 20:49.522
You can't outrun
your grief forever.

20:50.642 --> 20:53.161
When did you speak with Tara?
I went to the house

20:53.162 --> 20:54.921
to invite you both for dinner.

20:54.922 --> 20:57.881
Family should pull together
at a time like this.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.681
Oh, I'm sorry, Ingrid,
I can't tonight.

21:00.682 --> 21:03.682
I'm helping Barbara.

21:04.282 --> 21:07.282
Barbara! I hear congratulations
are in order.

21:08.002 --> 21:10.961
Your community award?
Oh, it's no big thing.

21:10.962 --> 21:13.481
It is a big thing.
Absolutely.

21:13.482 --> 21:15.521
And so well deserved.

21:15.631 --> 21:20.178
Spending your days in here doling
out soup to all the old dears.

21:20.596 --> 21:23.760
I don't know how you do it.
Well, volunteer for a day.

21:23.857 --> 21:26.857
Oh, I'd love to, but the Watch
takes up all my time these days.

21:26.882 --> 21:29.281
Which reminds me.
Sandwich board outside?

21:29.282 --> 21:32.282
Bit of an eyesore.
I'll leave you to bring it in.

21:37.082 --> 21:40.082
I swear, one of these days...
I'll be right behind you.

22:00.162 --> 22:03.162
Mr Meer?

22:16.122 --> 22:19.122
Mr Meer?

22:20.602 --> 22:23.521
Can I help you?
It's DS Winter, isn't it?

22:23.522 --> 22:26.522
Yeah, that's right.
I need to erm...

22:26.562 --> 22:29.562
ask you about the call you took
from Angus Colton the day he died.

22:29.602 --> 22:31.201
I don't remember a call.

22:31.202 --> 22:34.202
This one was at 5:00am.

22:35.362 --> 22:38.361
Camera!
Camera?

22:38.362 --> 22:40.361
Angus wanted to borrow mine.

22:40.362 --> 22:43.362
He called you at five in the
morning just to borrow a camera?

22:45.242 --> 22:47.281
It's a top-of-the-range DSLR.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.321
Did he say why he needed it?

22:49.322 --> 22:52.041
Watch business.
What kind of Watch business?

22:52.042 --> 22:55.042
I don't know. Iwas half-asleep
when he called.

22:55.202 --> 22:56.961
I told him to come round
and get it.

22:56.962 --> 22:59.962
And did he?
About an hour later.

23:01.202 --> 23:04.202
Thanks.

23:10.842 --> 23:13.842
We have a statement
from an eyewitness.

23:16.282 --> 23:18.921
One I'm inclined to believe.

23:18.922 --> 23:21.922
All right. Yes.
I went to see Angus.

23:22.042 --> 23:24.401
You didn't
tell us that yesterday.

23:24.402 --> 23:27.401
You didn't
I didn't want Mitch to know.

23:27.402 --> 23:29.321
Angus was our supplier.

23:29.322 --> 23:31.841
And, yes, him and Mitch
fought all the time,

23:31.842 --> 23:33.481
but he did us a good deal.

23:33.482 --> 23:35.121
So you were making peace?

23:35.122 --> 23:38.041
I was doing it for the business.
We're running a restaurant.

23:38.042 --> 23:41.042
We're not going to get very far
without meat.

23:41.522 --> 23:44.081
And what did Angus
have to say to that?

23:44.082 --> 23:46.881
He said he'd think about it.

23:46.882 --> 23:49.882
What time did you leave him?

23:50.042 --> 23:53.042
Four? He said he had to close
up, he was expecting somebody.

23:53.522 --> 23:56.522
Did he say who?
No.

23:58.322 --> 24:01.322
Is it all right if I go?

24:11.202 --> 24:13.841
Soup and sandwiches
for table nine?

24:13.842 --> 24:16.561
There you are, young man.
Carrot and coriander soup.

24:16.562 --> 24:19.081
Two of your five a day.
Say 'thank you'.

24:19.082 --> 24:22.082
And sandwiches for you both.
Thank you.

24:22.602 --> 24:25.602
Would you like a sandwich?

24:29.442 --> 24:32.161
Sure you're not being a little
precious? It's only dinner.

24:32.162 --> 24:35.162
Ijust don't like Tara spending
all that time alone with Ingrid.

24:35.202 --> 24:37.561
She fills her head with stories
about Frank.

24:37.562 --> 24:40.041
Well, then, go along too.
I can't.

24:40.042 --> 24:42.201
I said I was helping you tonight.

24:42.202 --> 24:45.202
How come I'm always your alibi?

24:46.002 --> 24:49.002
Talking of alibis, you're late.

25:51.802 --> 25:53.401
Boo!

25:53.402 --> 25:56.402
For God's sake, Henry!

26:03.322 --> 26:05.121
Fool.

26:05.122 --> 26:07.881
So Colton was meeting someone?

26:07.882 --> 26:09.921
In his shop after hours.

26:09.922 --> 26:11.521
Maybe it was a business meeting.

26:11.522 --> 26:13.521
On a Saturday night?

26:13.522 --> 26:15.481
Do you think it was his killer?

26:15.482 --> 26:16.961
Maybe.

26:16.962 --> 26:19.962
Or maybe Lena made up the whole
story to throw us off the scent.

26:21.482 --> 26:24.482
You think she's lying?
I think she's holding back.

26:25.962 --> 26:27.361
Why would she do that?

26:27.362 --> 26:30.362
To protect herself,
or someone else.

26:30.442 --> 26:33.121
Someone like Mitch?

26:33.122 --> 26:36.122
Any luck with Azeem's camera?
It's not on the search inventory.

26:37.042 --> 26:39.121
That suggests
our killer took it.

26:39.122 --> 26:41.961
Which suggests Colton took
a photograph of something

26:41.962 --> 26:44.962
he shouldn't have.
We need to find that camera.

27:43.402 --> 27:46.402
H ello?

27:49.922 --> 27:52.922
H ello?

28:07.002 --> 28:10.002
Oh, no!

28:12.242 --> 28:15.242
What the hell...?

28:15.842 --> 28:18.842
I don't believe this!

28:22.802 --> 28:24.761
No!

28:24.762 --> 28:27.762
Aargh!

28:33.674 --> 28:33.782
â™ªâ™ª

28:42.062 --> 28:44.661
Morning, sir.
What have we got?

28:44.662 --> 28:46.101
Break-in.

28:46.102 --> 28:49.102
Mitch McAllister was attacked by
a burglar around two last night.

28:49.222 --> 28:51.061
Is he OK?
Took a knock to the head.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.546
Nothing too serious. The paramedics
are checking him over.

28:55.462 --> 28:56.781
What was stolen?

28:56.782 --> 28:58.901
Nothing, as far as we can tell.

28:58.902 --> 29:01.902
But they did make quite a mess.

29:04.582 --> 29:06.621
They turned on
all the downstairs taps

29:06.622 --> 29:09.622
and made sure
to block the drain.

29:09.862 --> 29:12.701
What was the M0
on the other burglaries?

29:12.702 --> 29:15.702
Residential properties. Hit by
day while the owners were out.

29:16.862 --> 29:18.541
Were the properties vandalised?

29:18.542 --> 29:20.501
No. Clean jobs.

29:20.502 --> 29:23.502
Quick, in and out.
Only small items of value taken.

29:25.102 --> 29:27.421
So this is a commercial property

29:27.422 --> 29:30.181
accessed at night,
with the owners in bed.

29:30.182 --> 29:33.182
Nothing of value taken and
malicious damage caused.

29:33.262 --> 29:36.262
Yes?
Yea h.

29:36.822 --> 29:39.822
Entry point?

29:40.462 --> 29:43.301
And the alarm had been disabled.

29:43.302 --> 29:46.302
Precision job.

29:51.062 --> 29:52.861
What was used to block the drains?

29:52.862 --> 29:55.061
Tablecloths.
Where are they kept?

29:55.062 --> 29:56.901
Airing cupboard
under the stairs.

29:56.902 --> 29:58.901
Not exactly easy to find.

29:58.902 --> 30:01.902
Unless you knew where they were.

30:06.782 --> 30:09.621
Good morning.

30:09.622 --> 30:12.622
It was a late night last night.
I suppose.

30:13.902 --> 30:15.621
I thought it was just dinner.

30:15.622 --> 30:18.141
Aunt Ingrid and I got talking.

30:18.142 --> 30:19.861
Yeah?

30:19.862 --> 30:22.862
About what?
Dad mainly.

30:26.662 --> 30:29.662
How come no-one told me
he was in a band at university?

30:31.422 --> 30:33.181
Cos they weren't up to much.

30:33.182 --> 30:35.861
Aunt Ingrid says they were great.

30:35.862 --> 30:38.862
Well, your dad was her brother.

30:39.822 --> 30:42.822
And your Aunt Ingrid isn't exactly
known for her taste in music.

30:44.662 --> 30:47.221
She says she's gonna look out
their demo for me,

30:47.222 --> 30:49.501
let me listen to it.

30:49.502 --> 30:51.421
Be nice to hear his voice again.

30:51.422 --> 30:53.941
I remember we used to
sing along to the radio

30:53.942 --> 30:56.741
when he took me swimming.
Remember?

30:56.742 --> 30:58.821
He knew all the words.

30:58.822 --> 31:01.822
Can't say I do.

31:03.262 --> 31:06.262
But then swimming was always
yours and your dad's thing.

31:07.022 --> 31:09.261
Why did you never come with us?

31:09.262 --> 31:11.781
Ijust never fancied it,
that's all.

31:11.782 --> 31:14.782
Anyway, me and Aunt Ingrid
are planning a night next week.

31:15.542 --> 31:17.181
We're gonna listen to the demo.

31:17.182 --> 31:20.182
Well, that sounds like

31:20.742 --> 31:23.581
a truly miserable night.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.582
Why are you always doing this?
Doing what?

31:27.022 --> 31:29.381
Running Dad down.
I'm not running your dad down.

31:29.382 --> 31:32.061
It's just that,
when it comes to your father,

31:32.062 --> 31:34.421
Aunt Ingrid has
a very selective memory.

31:34.422 --> 31:37.422
She chooses to remember
the good points.

31:39.662 --> 31:42.541
Isn't that how you're supposed
to remember the dead?

31:42.542 --> 31:45.542
I wonder why you married him,
seeing as you obviously hated him!

31:45.782 --> 31:48.421
I didn't hate your dad.
You didn't love him either.

31:48.422 --> 31:51.422
There are different kinds
of love, Tara. No, there aren't!

31:56.182 --> 31:59.061
So you're saying
it's an inside job?

31:59.062 --> 32:01.501
There are inconsistencies.

32:01.502 --> 32:03.341
What inconsistencies?

32:03.342 --> 32:05.181
You can't think we did this.

32:05.182 --> 32:07.981
Look at him! He's been attacked!

32:07.982 --> 32:09.861
He can't have done that to himself!

32:09.862 --> 32:11.381
Whoever broke in last night

32:11.382 --> 32:13.741
knew their way around
your alarm system.

32:13.742 --> 32:16.742
Do you have other employees?
No. It's just me and Lena now.

32:18.182 --> 32:20.741
We had to let a few people go.

32:20.742 --> 32:23.742
Any of them resent you for that?

32:26.862 --> 32:29.862
No point continuing patrols with
the police all over the village.

32:29.982 --> 32:32.141
There's still plenty for
the Watch to do.

32:32.142 --> 32:34.221
Like finding this burglar.
Yeah.

32:34.222 --> 32:37.222
Surely the break-ins are small fry
given that there's been a murder!

32:37.582 --> 32:40.261
Easy for you to say.
It wasn't your house broken into.

32:40.262 --> 32:42.621
Hear, hear. Damn violation!

32:42.622 --> 32:44.661
We're surplus to requirements.

32:44.662 --> 32:47.662
On the contrary, I think we are
very required right now.

32:49.142 --> 32:51.621
Angus's murder has left
the village in shock.

32:51.622 --> 32:53.741
People are very frightened.

32:53.742 --> 32:56.461
We must get out there
and show everybody

32:56.462 --> 32:59.462
that the Watch is still here and
that we are still on their side.

33:00.502 --> 33:03.502
Exactly. We keep going.

33:03.822 --> 33:05.981
For Angus.
Yeah.

33:05.982 --> 33:08.982
And to hell with the police.

33:17.462 --> 33:20.462
Adrian?

33:22.422 --> 33:25.422
Whoever broke into The Gallows
had a knowledge of its layout.

33:26.302 --> 33:27.941
Everyone knows The Gallows!

33:27.942 --> 33:30.781
But not everyone has an axe
to grind with their ex-employer.

33:30.782 --> 33:33.782
Mitch sacked you last month.
That was unfair dismissal.

33:34.342 --> 33:36.781
Where were you last night?
Adrian was here.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.781
He was helping me with
the patrol rota.

33:39.782 --> 33:42.782
We had a late finish, so I made
up the guest bedroom for him.

33:44.862 --> 33:47.862
You were here all night?
Ingrid made me breakfast.

33:52.022 --> 33:55.021
If you're looking for someone
to question, try Duncan Walton.

33:55.022 --> 33:58.022
Why would he break in?
I'm not suggesting he did.

33:58.422 --> 34:01.422
But last night's patrol...
does record

34:02.062 --> 34:05.062
that Duncan was seen
leaving his house at 1:00am.

34:05.902 --> 34:07.901
Strange for him to be out so late,

34:07.902 --> 34:10.902
but maybe he saw your intruder.

34:17.382 --> 34:19.101
So, what do you think?

34:19.101 --> 34:21.460
I think we need to watch Ingrid.

34:21.462 --> 34:24.462
Think Adrian was there all night?

34:24.502 --> 34:26.021
Call the station.

34:26.022 --> 34:28.141
See if Forensics
found anything at the pub.

34:28.141 --> 34:31.141
I'll talk to Duncan Walton.

34:44.902 --> 34:47.902
Have to hand it to you, Ingrid.
That was quick thinking.

34:50.022 --> 34:53.022
What did I tell you about the pub?

34:53.062 --> 34:55.621
To stay away.
Defy me like that again

34:55.621 --> 34:58.622
and I'll run you out of
my village. Got it?

34:59.422 --> 35:02.422
Yeah.

35:11.542 --> 35:13.461
Look at the state of it!

35:13.462 --> 35:15.221
We'll have to close till tomorrow.

35:15.222 --> 35:16.741
Can't afford to close.

35:16.742 --> 35:19.742
We can't open with
a flooded kitchen.

35:20.222 --> 35:23.221
A load of that food
is all perished.

35:23.222 --> 35:26.222
If my dad could see this...
He'd understand.

35:26.422 --> 35:28.821
You think?

35:28.822 --> 35:31.421
All the work he put into this pub.

35:31.422 --> 35:33.341
The man's legacy to me.

35:33.342 --> 35:36.021
And I go and run it
into the ground.

35:36.022 --> 35:37.661
We're not there yet.

35:37.662 --> 35:40.662
We'll be there soon if the Watch
has anything to do with it.

35:40.822 --> 35:43.421
I've got to go to Little Crosby.

35:43.422 --> 35:45.821
Why have you got to go there?
I've got a booking.

35:45.822 --> 35:48.822
A hen party. They want the
works - hair, nails, make-up.

35:49.622 --> 35:52.622
How long are you gonna be?
I reckon it'll be a late one.

36:02.422 --> 36:05.421
Promise me
you won't do anything stupid.

36:05.422 --> 36:08.422
Sure.

36:12.702 --> 36:15.702
I went for a walk.
At one in the morning?

36:15.742 --> 36:17.541
Oh, that's early for you,
Duncan.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.901
I have trouble sleeping
sometimes.

36:19.902 --> 36:22.101
Restless legs.
Terrible affliction.

36:22.102 --> 36:25.102
I don't like to wake Barbara so,
instead, I go out for a stroll.

36:27.222 --> 36:29.661
Did you pass The Gallows?
The Gallows?

36:29.662 --> 36:31.301
No. Why?

36:31.302 --> 36:32.981
There was a break-in last night.

36:32.982 --> 36:35.581
Perhaps you witnessed something.

36:35.582 --> 36:38.582
Er... sorry, no.
I went the other way.

36:38.822 --> 36:41.822
So you saw nothing untoward?
No, it was all quiet.

36:44.742 --> 36:47.742
Well, er...
thank you for your time.

36:52.542 --> 36:54.341
I didn't hear you come back.
What?

36:54.342 --> 36:57.342
I usually hear you come back in.
How long were you out for?

36:57.422 --> 37:00.061
Oh, an hour or so.
What...?

37:00.062 --> 37:03.062
Mum, come on!
I don't see what the problem is.

37:03.582 --> 37:06.582
Ijust don't think you should be
spending so much time up there.

37:06.862 --> 37:09.862
Auntie Ingrid is family.
I'm family too.

37:10.102 --> 37:12.741
Yeah, but you're never around!

37:12.742 --> 37:15.742
Tara! That's not fair!

37:18.502 --> 37:21.101
She wants to spend more time
with Ingrid together

37:21.102 --> 37:23.021
so they can really bond.

37:23.022 --> 37:26.022
Bonding with Ingrid? Sounds awful.

37:26.142 --> 37:27.901
Tell me about it. What should I do?

37:27.902 --> 37:30.741
Maxine, I've no experience of kids.

37:30.742 --> 37:33.301
You have experience of Duncan.

37:33.302 --> 37:36.302
Oh, for crying out loud!

37:36.782 --> 37:38.541
Everything OK, darling?

37:38.542 --> 37:41.021
The plates are too slippy!

37:41.022 --> 37:44.022
Hear that? We've got slippy plates.

37:48.462 --> 37:50.381
Lab results came back on Colton.

37:50.382 --> 37:53.382
Slim pickings. Nothing to help you
identify your killer, I'm afraid.

37:54.502 --> 37:57.502
So, we need to have dinner tonight.

37:58.462 --> 38:01.462
We need to have dinner?
It's time we had the talk.

38:02.382 --> 38:04.781
What talk?
You know what talk.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.701
No, I don't.

38:06.702 --> 38:09.702
Dorset.
We don't need to go into that.

38:10.302 --> 38:13.302
I'll pick you up at eight.

38:59.342 --> 39:00.981
What's the Bleakridge Watch?

39:00.982 --> 39:03.982
They're like a rural Stasi.

39:06.422 --> 39:08.741
24 members?
What's wrong with that?

39:08.742 --> 39:11.742
Sally at school tried to set up
a Watch. Only two turned up.

39:12.142 --> 39:15.142
They only came for the cake.
Sally set up a community watch?

39:15.742 --> 39:18.742
Yeah.
She wanted to do her civic duty.

39:19.422 --> 39:21.701
And she fancied her neighbour.

39:21.702 --> 39:24.702
That makes more sense.

39:25.582 --> 39:28.582
So, did you speak to jamie today?
Many times.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.221
They met on a training course.

39:32.222 --> 39:34.181
Yes, but what happened
on the course?

39:34.182 --> 39:37.182
What usually happens. Two days
trapped in a soulless hotel

39:37.662 --> 39:40.461
listening to people telling you
things you already know.

39:40.462 --> 39:42.581
You should call him.
Ask him out for a drink.

39:42.582 --> 39:44.301
Then you can properly grill him.

39:44.302 --> 39:47.302
Or I could do nothing of the sort.

39:49.142 --> 39:50.781
Anyway, there's no point calling.

39:50.782 --> 39:53.782
He and Kam
went out for dinner tonight.

39:55.142 --> 39:57.301
Rekindling the flame?

39:57.302 --> 40:00.302
Discussing the case more likely.
Uh-uh.

40:11.902 --> 40:14.301
Nothing happened.
Are you sure about that?

40:14.302 --> 40:16.381
Absolutely.

40:16.382 --> 40:18.421
What about the hotel bar?

40:18.422 --> 40:21.422
What about it?
I remember karaoke.

40:22.142 --> 40:24.501
You murdered Like A Prayer.

40:24.502 --> 40:26.941
And the dancing?

40:26.942 --> 40:29.942
That was later. In your room.

40:30.902 --> 40:33.902
Well, I guess we just had
a few too many. I should say so.

40:34.382 --> 40:37.382
The whole night was a blur.
I can't remember a thing.

40:37.542 --> 40:40.542
So then we can't say for sure
that nothing happened, now, can we?

40:45.182 --> 40:48.182
Look. It doesn't matter to me
one way or the other.

40:48.382 --> 40:51.061
Fact is, we have to work
together now.

40:51.062 --> 40:53.221
I don't want things
to be awkward between us.

40:53.222 --> 40:55.981
I'm not awkward about it.
You seem pretty awkward.

40:55.982 --> 40:58.101
That's because
you keep going on about it.

40:58.102 --> 41:01.102
Then I won't mention it again.
Good. Good.

41:01.622 --> 41:04.341
Your ribs, sir.
Thank you.

41:07.022 --> 41:10.022
Do you want a rib?

41:16.062 --> 41:19.062
â™ª Vesti La Giubba

42:18.220 --> 42:18.337
â™ªâ™ª

42:22.722 --> 42:25.722
Morning.

42:27.362 --> 42:30.362
Azeem Meer. And it's not pretty.

42:30.562 --> 42:32.041
Who found him?
Postman.

42:32.042 --> 42:34.801
Around six this morning.
Saw the door was unlocked.

42:34.802 --> 42:37.001
Came in to see
that everything was all right

42:37.002 --> 42:40.002
and got the shock of his life.

42:48.002 --> 42:49.881
Looks like another bludgeoning.

42:49.882 --> 42:51.961
And the weapon of choice?

42:51.962 --> 42:54.521
Missing a hammer from
the display in the shop.

42:54.522 --> 42:56.401
Cause of death should be easy.

42:56.402 --> 42:58.481
Blunt force trauma to the skull.

42:58.482 --> 43:01.241
What about forensics?
Iwouldn't get your hopes up.

43:01.242 --> 43:03.241
Stuff in here is decades old.

43:03.242 --> 43:06.242
The entire place
is covered in material.

43:10.042 --> 43:12.641
Careful.

43:12.642 --> 43:15.642
Wait. What is that?

43:16.802 --> 43:18.801
We saw those marks
on Angus Colton!

43:18.802 --> 43:20.321
Oh, yeah.

43:20.322 --> 43:23.322
Sir?
Thank you, Kam.

43:25.402 --> 43:28.281
Meer's phone. Lots of text
messages last night,

43:28.282 --> 43:31.282
all from the same number.

43:31.562 --> 43:34.481
Stay here. Keep searching.

43:34.482 --> 43:37.482
OK, you can take him now.

43:41.922 --> 43:43.881
I didn't kill Azeem!

43:43.882 --> 43:46.882
You certainly threatened to.

43:47.282 --> 43:50.121
Texts. Sent last night.

43:50.122 --> 43:52.801
From your phone to Azeem Meer's.

43:52.802 --> 43:54.841
Saying you were going round
to kill him.

43:54.842 --> 43:57.842
Yeah, OK, I sent some texts,
but notjust to him.

43:58.442 --> 44:01.161
To all the Watch. Check my phone.

44:01.162 --> 44:04.162
I sent messages to all of them -
Adrian, Ingrid, Azeem...

44:05.002 --> 44:08.002
What the hell were you thinking?
Iwas drunk. Iwas angry.

44:09.202 --> 44:12.201
I was sick of that lot
ruling the roost.

44:12.202 --> 44:15.202
Where were you both last night?
Iwas in Causton.

44:15.282 --> 44:18.282
Mitch was here.

44:18.962 --> 44:20.881
What did you do?

44:20.882 --> 44:23.882
Someone sabotages my pub...

44:24.202 --> 44:26.521
..then, sure as hell
I'm gonna hit back.

44:26.522 --> 44:29.522
Mitch, what did you do?

44:31.282 --> 44:32.881
I'm gonna kill him!

44:32.882 --> 44:35.441
You see what happens
when you go against my orders?

44:35.442 --> 44:38.442
He ain't getting away with it!
Oh, leave it!

44:38.602 --> 44:40.721
We've got bigger problems.

44:40.722 --> 44:42.601
No. I'm dealing with this tonight.

44:45.882 --> 44:48.882
I suppose I could bide my time.

44:49.682 --> 44:52.682
Ingrid!

44:53.042 --> 44:56.042
Ingrid!
Take a breath. Tell me slowly.

44:56.322 --> 44:58.041
What's happened?

44:58.042 --> 45:01.042
It's Azeem.
He's been murdered!

45:02.842 --> 45:04.881
That's two members of the Watch
within a week!

45:04.882 --> 45:07.681
Yes. Thank you, Felix.
I am aware of that.

45:07.682 --> 45:09.401
What if one of us is next?

45:09.402 --> 45:12.281
If someone's coming after us,
we need to take precautions.

45:12.282 --> 45:14.641
I think we should
disband the Watch.

45:14.642 --> 45:16.161
Disband?

45:16.162 --> 45:19.162
Well, until they find the murderer,
at least.

45:20.162 --> 45:23.162
We set up this Watch
in honour of my brother.

45:23.322 --> 45:24.841
It was our tribute to him.

45:24.842 --> 45:27.842
If we disband this now, then
Frank's death has been in vain.

45:31.042 --> 45:34.042
Is that what you all want?
No.

45:36.322 --> 45:39.322
Good. Debrief in ten minutes.

45:40.442 --> 45:43.442
All right?

47:09.482 --> 47:11.001
Wales?

47:11.002 --> 47:13.121
Yeah, Wales.

47:13.122 --> 47:16.122
There's a mate of mine. Well...
a bloke I knew on the inside.

47:17.842 --> 47:20.842
He's got a business,
a building just outside Cardiff.

47:21.082 --> 47:24.082
He said... if I want,
there's a job for me.

47:24.802 --> 47:27.601
It's all above board, Maxine.

47:27.602 --> 47:29.281
We can't move to Wales.
Why not?

47:29.282 --> 47:32.282
What is there for us here?
It's our home.

47:32.802 --> 47:35.802
Some kind of home, if we have
to keep our relationship secret.

47:36.442 --> 47:39.442
At least in Wales,
we can meet up in public.

47:44.482 --> 47:46.961
What about Tara?

47:46.962 --> 47:49.962
She's 17.
She'll be going to uni soon.

47:50.882 --> 47:53.882
OK... jensen?

47:54.322 --> 47:57.322
Jensen will understand.

47:59.082 --> 48:02.082
So, when... would we move?

48:04.922 --> 48:07.921
Well, two weeks?
I can't move in two weeks!

48:07.922 --> 48:10.922
All right. Two months.

48:10.962 --> 48:13.962
It's this bloke.
He needs to know soon as.

48:17.442 --> 48:20.442
I'm sorry, I can't. It's too soon.

48:23.082 --> 48:25.921
Look, just think about it, Maxine.

48:25.922 --> 48:28.922
It's a chance for a new start!

48:31.562 --> 48:34.201
We've been using the insurance
inventories to compare.

48:34.202 --> 48:37.202
But as far as we can tell,
everything that was stolen is here.

48:37.722 --> 48:39.161
Everything?

48:39.162 --> 48:42.162
We also found Azeem's kit bag.

48:42.402 --> 48:45.402
Size 10. Left sole.
Vertical mark.

48:45.962 --> 48:48.962
Did anyone even look at Azeem Meer
as a suspect in the break-ins?

48:49.322 --> 48:51.281
I doubt it. No criminal record.

48:51.282 --> 48:53.201
He was the average model citizen.

48:53.202 --> 48:56.202
And his financial affairs?
More than solvent.

48:59.282 --> 49:01.881
Why does a financially
comfortable, middle-aged man

49:01.882 --> 49:04.882
with no previous form,
suddenly take up burglary?

49:05.762 --> 49:07.881
And why does he keep all his loot
in his shop?

49:07.882 --> 49:10.882
Why not sell some of it on?

49:14.602 --> 49:17.121
Maxine Lockston?

49:17.122 --> 49:20.122
Even by your standards,
that's a risky game, Henry.

49:20.322 --> 49:22.081
What's going on?
Nothing.

49:22.082 --> 49:23.881
Just a casual thing.

49:23.882 --> 49:26.882
That's why you meet in secret
every day, is it?

49:28.922 --> 49:31.561
This whole new leaf? The business?

49:31.562 --> 49:34.241
It's cos of her, then.

49:34.242 --> 49:37.201
I hope you're not planning on
saying anything, Henry.

49:37.202 --> 49:38.841
Course not.

49:38.842 --> 49:40.561
Cos that would be stupid.

49:40.562 --> 49:43.562
Yeah. I'm not going to say a word.

49:44.082 --> 49:47.082
Good.

49:48.402 --> 49:51.402
Cos you and me,
we're up to our necks in it!

49:54.722 --> 49:57.722
Azeem and Angus.

49:58.402 --> 50:01.402
Connections?
Both members of the Watch.

50:01.962 --> 50:04.962
And there's no doubt
the Watch has enemies.

50:05.842 --> 50:08.401
Mitch McAllister for one.

50:08.402 --> 50:10.041
But why go for these two?

50:10.042 --> 50:13.041
Why not go for Ingrid
and cut off the head?

50:13.042 --> 50:14.801
What else do they have in common?

50:14.802 --> 50:17.161
The burglaries.
Azeem was carrying them out,

50:17.162 --> 50:18.601
The burglaries.
Angus was investigating.

50:18.602 --> 50:20.721
Brings us back to
Azeem's missing camera.

50:20.722 --> 50:23.722
Why did the killer take it?
What about these?

50:26.282 --> 50:28.801
Both had similar
restraining injuries.

50:30.562 --> 50:32.161
Hm.

50:32.162 --> 50:35.162
DS Winter.

50:35.282 --> 50:38.282
OK. Yeah. Send them through.

50:38.442 --> 50:40.801
Tech boys.
Haven't found Meer's laptop,

50:40.802 --> 50:43.481
but they've got a personal cloud
account for me to look at.

50:43.482 --> 50:45.121
Go and speak to them.

50:45.122 --> 50:48.122
Meantime, I'm off to visit
the Bleakridge Watch.

50:59.842 --> 51:02.481
Azeem? Are you sure?

51:02.482 --> 51:04.801
None of you had any idea?

51:04.802 --> 51:07.601
Well, of course we didn't.
We'd have said something.

51:07.602 --> 51:10.481
We'd have strung him up.
I had my suspicions.

51:10.482 --> 51:12.961
Nothing concrete.
Just a feeling.

51:12.962 --> 51:15.361
And what prompted this feeling?

51:15.362 --> 51:18.362
Azeem's unease around
the subject of the break-ins.

51:18.842 --> 51:21.842
His objections
when I put Angus on the case.

51:22.602 --> 51:25.602
Oh! I should have said something.

51:28.602 --> 51:30.561
I suppose
Ijust didn't want to admit

51:30.562 --> 51:33.562
that one of our own
could betray us.

51:34.242 --> 51:37.242
To think he broke into our house
and stole all our things!

51:37.602 --> 51:39.601
Your belongings will be returned.

51:39.602 --> 51:42.602
Azeem stored everything he stole
in a room at the back of his shop.

51:43.522 --> 51:45.481
Why would he do that?

51:45.482 --> 51:47.201
That's what we're struggling with.

51:47.202 --> 51:50.202
Still, this isn't going to go
down well in the village, is it?

51:50.402 --> 51:53.201
Just as we were getting things
back on side as well!

51:53.202 --> 51:56.081
So, we have to admit our mistake.

51:56.082 --> 51:59.082
We have to put up our hands and
promise to rectify the situation.

52:00.482 --> 52:03.241
How we going to do that?
By doing everything we can

52:03.242 --> 52:06.242
to help DCI Barnaby
solve these murders.

52:07.082 --> 52:10.082
DCI Barnaby, the Bleakridge Watch
is now at your disposal.

52:22.282 --> 52:24.641
Hey.
Hi.

52:24.642 --> 52:27.561
Thanks for dinner last night.
It was... fun. Mm.

52:27.562 --> 52:30.562
You sure I can't pay half?
No, it was my treat.

52:30.682 --> 52:33.682
You can pay next time.

52:33.882 --> 52:35.481
What have you got there?

52:35.482 --> 52:37.401
Tech boys found
a personal cloud account

52:37.402 --> 52:40.201
Meer had synched with
his missing digital camera.

52:40.202 --> 52:42.281
What was Meer doing
photographing barns?

52:42.282 --> 52:45.201
Oh, he wasn't.
This picture was taken by Colton.

52:45.202 --> 52:48.161
Colton borrowed Meer's camera
the day before he died.

52:48.162 --> 52:49.801
Any chance you recognise it?

52:49.802 --> 52:51.841
Let me have a look.

52:51.842 --> 52:54.842
Telegraph pole.
OK, so there's a telegraph pole.

52:54.922 --> 52:57.721
Well, telegraph poles are numbered.

52:57.722 --> 53:00.722
So you find the number
and you find the pole.

53:01.282 --> 53:04.282
And that way you can find the barn.

54:14.826 --> 54:14.927
â™ªâ™ª

54:25.082 --> 54:27.081
Fire services reckon it was arson.

54:27.082 --> 54:29.481
They got here and stopped it
before it all went up.

54:29.482 --> 54:32.482
When was the fire?
The day we turned up in Bleakridge.

54:32.682 --> 54:34.881
The day after Angus Colton died?
Mm.

54:34.882 --> 54:36.561
Colton took a picture of this barn.

54:36.562 --> 54:38.481
12 hours later, he was dead.

54:38.482 --> 54:40.961
Azeem Meer viewed that picture
on an online account

54:40.962 --> 54:42.601
and then he died.

54:42.602 --> 54:45.602
And someone goes to a lot of
trouble to destroy the barn.

54:46.202 --> 54:48.481
Which brings me on to the car.

54:48.482 --> 54:51.482
The car with the rather ominous
damage to the front wing.

54:55.082 --> 54:57.801
Who was the car registered to?

54:57.802 --> 54:59.801
Why would you want to go to Wales?

54:59.802 --> 55:02.802
I don't really. But the thought of
getting out the village is tempting.

55:04.202 --> 55:07.121
But you can't leave!
Tell her, Duncan!

55:07.122 --> 55:09.121
I have to go out for a few hours.

55:09.122 --> 55:12.122
Really, Maxine, are you sure you
want to risk everything on this?

55:12.322 --> 55:14.801
On what?
On Henry.

55:14.802 --> 55:17.401
I know you're fond of him and
I can see he makes you happy,

55:17.402 --> 55:20.041
but, well, he's hardly Mr Reliable.

55:20.042 --> 55:22.321
Well, he's all I've got.

55:22.322 --> 55:24.481
Now that's not true. You have me.

55:24.482 --> 55:27.482
I know. But I love Henry.

55:28.522 --> 55:30.721
Well, then, that's that, I suppose.

55:30.722 --> 55:33.722
But what will I do without you?
You're the only friend I've got.

55:34.122 --> 55:37.122
Oh, thanks very much (!)
I thought you were going out.

55:40.282 --> 55:43.282
We'd like a word, Dr Walton.

55:46.842 --> 55:49.161
I'm not sure I understand.

55:49.162 --> 55:51.081
The car is registered to you?

55:51.082 --> 55:52.841
Well, yes.

55:52.842 --> 55:55.201
It was found yesterday in a
burned-out barn

55:55.202 --> 55:56.801
It was found yesterday in a
just outside the village.

55:56.802 --> 55:58.601
Well, how did it get there?

55:58.602 --> 56:01.161
We were hoping you could tell us.

56:01.162 --> 56:03.761
Surely it's in the police records?

56:03.762 --> 56:06.762
What is?
We reported the car stolen.

56:07.642 --> 56:10.642
Two years ago.

56:17.722 --> 56:20.722
How bad is it?
All these were due last week.

56:21.082 --> 56:23.841
I guess we'd better pay them, then.
With what?

56:23.842 --> 56:25.921
With that money
from the hen party job.

56:25.922 --> 56:28.081
Plus what I make this afternoon.

56:28.082 --> 56:29.841
You've got another booking?

56:29.842 --> 56:32.801
Bridal party.
Their stylist let them down,

56:32.802 --> 56:35.281
so they called to see
if I could step in last-minute.

56:35.282 --> 56:38.121
You said Causton.
What?

56:38.122 --> 56:40.921
When Barnaby asked you where
you were, you said Causton.

56:40.922 --> 56:43.922
But yesterday you told me the
hen party was in Little Crosby.

56:44.602 --> 56:47.602
Well, the client lives
over in Little Crosby.

56:48.202 --> 56:51.202
The actualjob was over in Causton.

56:51.642 --> 56:54.642
I got the addresses mixed up.

57:03.042 --> 57:06.042
Minutes from a council meeting
on funding for the Bleakridge Watch.

57:07.362 --> 57:10.362
Six weeks ago, they decided to
cut the Watch's funding in half,

57:11.122 --> 57:14.122
citing the drop in crime
as a reason.

57:15.882 --> 57:18.281
One week after the decision
was announced,

57:18.282 --> 57:20.241
the first burglary took place.

57:20.242 --> 57:22.081
It may be a coincidence...

57:22.082 --> 57:24.361
But it may not be.

57:24.362 --> 57:27.362
Earlier, Cecily Hope
said that the burglaries

57:27.642 --> 57:30.561
had helped The Watch
to get the village back onside.

57:30.562 --> 57:33.121
So, Azeem was breaking into
people's houses

57:33.122 --> 57:34.681
to make the Watch popular again?

57:34.682 --> 57:37.682
Might go some way to explaining
why he didn't get rid of his haul.

57:39.202 --> 57:42.202
Was he working alone?

57:42.522 --> 57:45.522
What kind of a background have
we done on the Watch members?

57:45.602 --> 57:48.401
Usual checks.
Didn't find anything.

57:48.402 --> 57:51.402
Let's dig a little deeper.

57:51.602 --> 57:53.761
What about Duncan Walton's car?

57:53.762 --> 57:56.762
Reported stolen from outside his
house on the 15th September, 2014.

58:00.202 --> 58:01.601
Hold on.

58:01.602 --> 58:04.602
Isn't that the day after
Frank Lockston's hit-and-run?

58:06.162 --> 58:08.681
Yeah.

58:08.682 --> 58:10.881
Are these the forensics
on Walton's car?

58:10.882 --> 58:13.641
They're still processing it,
but I have something on Meer.

58:13.642 --> 58:16.642
Restraining wounds showed traces
of hydrogen peroxide and PPD.

58:18.962 --> 58:20.561
That's what? Hair dye?

58:20.562 --> 58:23.562
PPD is a primary component in some
hair colouring products, yeah.

58:45.002 --> 58:46.641
Thanks.

58:46.642 --> 58:49.001
ANPR just picked up
Lena Ferrara's van

58:49.002 --> 58:50.761
outside the George Hotel
in Causton.

58:50.762 --> 58:53.762
Get a unit to meet me there.
Yes, sir.

58:54.602 --> 58:57.602
Dispatch, I need a unit.

59:00.562 --> 59:03.562
I need to see your guest list.

59:14.362 --> 59:17.001
Aargh!

59:17.002 --> 59:20.002
Aargh!

59:34.722 --> 59:37.722
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

59:56.282 --> 59:59.282
Mr Peck?
You can't park there.

59:59.762 --> 01:00:02.762
Permit holders only.
Official police business.

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:07.602
What kind of business?
I have some questions for you.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.161
Are you all right in there,
Duncan?

01:00:17.162 --> 01:00:20.162
Fine, thank you.

01:00:21.242 --> 01:00:23.561
Did you have to come bursting in
like that?

01:00:23.562 --> 01:00:25.281
Scared the life out of him.

01:00:25.282 --> 01:00:27.361
Could have had a heart attack.

01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:30.362
What exactly is this, Miss Ferrara?

01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:34.041
It's exactly what it looks like.

01:00:34.042 --> 01:00:36.481
A bit of a sideline.

01:00:36.482 --> 01:00:39.482
I provide light bondage
for a few select gentlemen.

01:00:41.602 --> 01:00:44.321
Does Mitch know about
your, erm... sideline?

01:00:44.322 --> 01:00:47.322
No. And I'd like
to keep it that way.

01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:51.801
I used to do this sort of work
a long time ago.

01:00:51.802 --> 01:00:54.802
Before I met Mitch.

01:00:56.162 --> 01:00:57.761
The pub's sinking.

01:00:57.762 --> 01:01:00.121
We need the money at the moment
to stay afloat,

01:01:00.122 --> 01:01:03.122
so I found myself a couple of
clients to keep ticking over.

01:01:03.602 --> 01:01:06.602
Like Angus Colton and Azeem Meer?

01:01:07.402 --> 01:01:10.402
Angus and Azeem were regulars.
And now they're both dead.

01:01:11.162 --> 01:01:13.121
That's nothing to do with me.

01:01:13.122 --> 01:01:16.122
You were with Azeem before he died.

01:01:16.762 --> 01:01:19.762
So what?

01:01:22.042 --> 01:01:24.681
Should I erm... call my solicitor?

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:27.682
You're not under arrest, Duncan.
Consenting adults.

01:01:29.002 --> 01:01:32.002
Now off you pop.

01:01:35.162 --> 01:01:38.162
Um... Will you tell my wife,
DCI Barnaby?

01:01:45.242 --> 01:01:47.601
Why would I murder Azeem and Angus?

01:01:47.602 --> 01:01:49.241
I needed their money, didn't I?

01:01:49.242 --> 01:01:51.441
Perhaps they'd planned
to expose you.

01:01:51.442 --> 01:01:54.441
They'd never do that.
How can you be so sure?

01:01:54.442 --> 01:01:57.442
Because the one thing you need
in this business is trust.

01:01:58.642 --> 01:02:01.642
They'd never betray me.

01:02:02.122 --> 01:02:04.681
Particularly Azeem.

01:02:04.682 --> 01:02:07.121
God... Poor man.

01:02:07.122 --> 01:02:10.122
He was paranoid about
being found out.

01:02:10.922 --> 01:02:12.721
Why was he so paranoid?

01:02:12.722 --> 01:02:15.321
He was a bachelor.
It is the 21st century.

01:02:15.322 --> 01:02:16.961
He wasn't worried about himself.

01:02:16.962 --> 01:02:19.321
He was worried about me
being exposed.

01:02:19.322 --> 01:02:22.322
Him going on all the time
about protecting my virtue.

01:02:27.802 --> 01:02:30.802
You enjoy being in The Watch?
More of a duty than a pleasure.

01:02:31.522 --> 01:02:33.281
You take it seriously.

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:35.241
I have to.
I'm second-in-command.

01:02:35.242 --> 01:02:38.121
I thought that was Colton?
Yeah, all right.

01:02:38.122 --> 01:02:41.122
Officially, I suppose,
Angus was 'deputy co-ordinator'.

01:02:41.442 --> 01:02:44.442
But, unofficially...?
I'm Ingrid's right-hand man.

01:02:45.482 --> 01:02:47.801
What about Azeem?
What about him?

01:02:47.802 --> 01:02:50.802
He and Ingrid close? I've been
looking through his call records.

01:02:51.442 --> 01:02:53.921
He and Ingrid
were in contact a lot.

01:02:53.922 --> 01:02:56.001
What are you trying to say?
Just asking.

01:02:56.002 --> 01:02:59.002
Azeem might have been Ingrid's
flavour of the month this past...

01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:02.321
Month?

01:03:02.322 --> 01:03:05.322
..but it's just a phase. There's
nothing going on between 'em.

01:03:05.442 --> 01:03:08.442
Ingrid knows who she can rely on.

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:15.121
Sounds like he was jealous.
There's no doubt about it.

01:03:15.122 --> 01:03:17.961
But it made me take
another look at the calls

01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:20.601
between Ingrid and Azeem.

01:03:20.602 --> 01:03:23.602
I pulled these ones out here.

01:03:24.642 --> 01:03:26.241
Do you recognise the dates?

01:03:26.242 --> 01:03:28.081
The burglaries!

01:03:28.082 --> 01:03:31.082
Ingrid Lockston calls Azeem
the morning of each break-in.

01:03:31.482 --> 01:03:34.361
Now, most of the calls were
between two and three minutes.

01:03:34.362 --> 01:03:36.681
But, the last one,

01:03:36.682 --> 01:03:39.601
made on the morning of the Felix
and Cecily Hope break-in,

01:03:39.602 --> 01:03:41.721
it's different.

01:03:41.722 --> 01:03:44.722
12 seconds long.
Not much of a conversation.

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:46.961
They were arranging a meeting?

01:03:46.962 --> 01:03:49.001
An hour after that call,

01:03:49.002 --> 01:03:52.002
Azeem paid for two coffees
in a cafe in Causton.

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:55.881
Checked his transactions.
Did you contact the cafe?

01:03:55.882 --> 01:03:57.641
The manager remembers Azeem well.

01:03:57.642 --> 01:04:00.642
The reason he does is because
Azeem had a stand-up row

01:04:01.242 --> 01:04:03.041
with the woman he was meeting.

01:04:03.042 --> 01:04:06.042
Tell me he described Ingrid.
Even better than that.

01:04:13.762 --> 01:04:16.762
Table by the window.

01:04:20.362 --> 01:04:23.362
And cue Ingrid Lockston.

01:05:03.213 --> 01:05:03.321
â™ªâ™ª

01:05:05.422 --> 01:05:10.039
But what are we to do, Ingrid?
We must carry on regardless.

01:05:10.262 --> 01:05:13.262
But how can we,
now that everybody knows

01:05:13.302 --> 01:05:15.821
that Azeem was responsible
for the break-ins?

01:05:15.822 --> 01:05:18.021
No-one in the village
is taking us seriously!

01:05:18.022 --> 01:05:21.022
We've got no authority.
We just have to ride this out.

01:05:22.222 --> 01:05:24.781
Azeem Meer betrayed us.

01:05:25.677 --> 01:05:28.677
He took advantage of us.

01:05:28.702 --> 01:05:31.702
People will soon see
that we were not to blame.

01:05:33.302 --> 01:05:35.741
But you were to blame.

01:05:35.742 --> 01:05:38.021
You were working with Azeem.

01:05:38.022 --> 01:05:40.781
That's utterly ridiculous!

01:05:40.782 --> 01:05:43.621
You called him on the days that
he carried out the burglaries.

01:05:43.622 --> 01:05:46.541
SO I made a call.
And the meeting.

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:49.542
Don't forget about
your argument in the cafe.

01:05:50.022 --> 01:05:52.541
What was it that Azeem
was so upset about?

01:05:52.542 --> 01:05:55.541
Was it that he wasn't prepared
to do your dirty work any more?

01:05:55.542 --> 01:05:57.581
My dirty work?

01:05:57.582 --> 01:06:00.101
I don't think that Azeem
was a willing participant.

01:06:00.102 --> 01:06:02.381
I think you had something on him.

01:06:02.382 --> 01:06:05.382
Or at least on someone
he cared about.

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.741
Was that the deal, Ingrid?

01:06:07.742 --> 01:06:10.021
You keep quiet and in return

01:06:10.022 --> 01:06:13.022
Azeem is forced
to carry out the burglaries?

01:06:15.142 --> 01:06:17.021
I am the leader of the Watch.

01:06:17.022 --> 01:06:19.541
Why on earth would I force
anyone into crime?

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:22.542
Because you were losing funding,
and the support of the village.

01:06:23.742 --> 01:06:26.742
So you decided to remind everyone
how much they still needed The Watch

01:06:28.542 --> 01:06:31.542
by arranging a spate of burglaries.

01:06:33.702 --> 01:06:35.341
Have you ever heard the like?

01:06:35.342 --> 01:06:38.342
Well, it is odd,
Azeem resorting to housebreaking.

01:06:39.542 --> 01:06:42.541
He was so... honest.

01:06:42.542 --> 01:06:44.821
Bit of a stick in the mud, really.

01:06:44.822 --> 01:06:47.381
And you were mad about the funding.

01:06:47.382 --> 01:06:49.461
Furious, as I recall.

01:06:49.462 --> 01:06:51.381
And then there's the patrol rotas.

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:54.101
You made me change them.
On the days of the break-ins,

01:06:54.102 --> 01:06:57.102
you told me to stand all
the patrols down. Yes, well...

01:06:58.622 --> 01:07:01.622
It was a mistake.

01:07:02.382 --> 01:07:05.382
Henry?

01:07:08.422 --> 01:07:11.422
Henry?
He's not here.

01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:14.542
Some banker down at Badger's
Drift's after an extension.

01:07:15.222 --> 01:07:18.222
Henry went down there
to pitch for the job.

01:07:19.622 --> 01:07:21.301
Right.

01:07:21.302 --> 01:07:24.221
So what's the plan, Maxine?

01:07:24.222 --> 01:07:27.222
What do you mean?
You and Henry.

01:07:27.502 --> 01:07:30.461
He seems to have got it
bad for you.

01:07:30.462 --> 01:07:33.462
You and him going to live
happily ever after?

01:07:33.862 --> 01:07:36.862
Maybe you should ask Henry.
Ask him what?

01:07:37.782 --> 01:07:40.782
We're thinking of moving.
Moving? Moving where?

01:07:41.942 --> 01:07:44.942
Henry's mentioned Wales.
Has he, now?

01:07:47.942 --> 01:07:50.341
Tell him to call me.

01:07:50.342 --> 01:07:52.501
You wanna be careful, Maxine.
Let go of me!

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:55.502
There's something you need to know,
and it's best you hear it now.

01:07:56.462 --> 01:07:59.462
From me.

01:08:02.142 --> 01:08:04.781
It's been a sham
from start to finish.

01:08:04.782 --> 01:08:07.782
Was that entirely necessary?

01:08:07.902 --> 01:08:10.902
Right now, losing the Watch is
the least of your worries, Ingrid.

01:08:11.222 --> 01:08:13.501
Two men have been killed.

01:08:13.502 --> 01:08:15.501
Both had the potential
to expose you.

01:08:15.502 --> 01:08:17.821
I hope you're not suggesting...

01:08:17.822 --> 01:08:20.701
Azeem Meer knew that
you were behind the burglaries,

01:08:20.702 --> 01:08:23.140
and Angus Colton
was investigating them.

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:25.501
Angus Colton was a fool.

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:27.501
That's why I gave him
the investigation.

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:30.502
I knew he didn't have
the brains to solve it.

01:08:30.942 --> 01:08:32.821
But whatever way you look at it,

01:08:32.822 --> 01:08:35.822
Azeem carried out
those break-ins alone.

01:08:37.462 --> 01:08:40.462
So you're going to have to think
of something else to pin on me.

01:08:51.462 --> 01:08:54.462
Hairdressing jobs

01:08:54.742 --> 01:08:57.742
How stupid am I?

01:08:59.062 --> 01:09:02.062
I'm sorry. I should've told you.

01:09:02.822 --> 01:09:05.822
Maybe. But it wouldn't have made
finding out any easier.

01:09:07.662 --> 01:09:10.261
The important thing

01:09:10.261 --> 01:09:13.261
is that I have not been
unfaithful to you, not once.

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:15.981
You're kidding, right?

01:09:15.982 --> 01:09:18.301
It's not what you think.

01:09:18.301 --> 01:09:21.301
I work with select clients.
I am good at my job, professional.

01:09:23.542 --> 01:09:26.542
Well, I'd hate to think
it was a hobby.

01:09:26.902 --> 01:09:29.781
All those blokes.

01:09:29.782 --> 01:09:32.421
Everyone we know.

01:09:32.421 --> 01:09:35.421
I have to live in this village.

01:09:36.301 --> 01:09:39.301
What must they think, Lena?
I don't care.

01:09:40.381 --> 01:09:42.421
I mean it. I don't.

01:09:42.421 --> 01:09:45.180
All I care about is you.

01:09:45.182 --> 01:09:47.741
And if keeping this pub
is what makes you happy,

01:09:47.742 --> 01:09:50.140
then I will do
whatever I have to do.

01:09:50.142 --> 01:09:52.220
I won't apologise for it.

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:55.222
Mitch... I love you.

01:09:56.822 --> 01:09:59.822
No pub's worth
living like this for.

01:10:00.902 --> 01:10:03.902
You'd best pack your bags.

01:10:21.582 --> 01:10:23.741
Maxine!

01:10:23.742 --> 01:10:26.061
Maxine!
Stay away from me!

01:10:26.062 --> 01:10:28.381
Why? What's the matter?

01:10:28.382 --> 01:10:30.421
Wait. What's happened?
Jensen told me.

01:10:30.422 --> 01:10:32.061
What's he told you?

01:10:32.062 --> 01:10:34.021
Just how sick and twisted are you?

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:38.334
You kill my husband, Tara's dad
and then what? You seduce me?

01:10:38.422 --> 01:10:39.821
No! That's not what happened!

01:10:39.822 --> 01:10:41.861
You get Frank out the way,
then swoop in?

01:10:41.862 --> 01:10:44.862
Maxine! Please!
Don't you dare touch me!

01:10:45.262 --> 01:10:48.262
I never want to see you again,
Henry!

01:10:48.702 --> 01:10:51.702
No, Maxine! Wait!

01:10:55.982 --> 01:10:58.982
Whoever killed Azeem and Angus
didn't want us to find that car.

01:11:00.462 --> 01:11:02.741
But why kill for a stolen car?

01:11:02.742 --> 01:11:05.501
It was used in the hit-and-run
that killed Frank Lockston.

01:11:05.502 --> 01:11:08.502
Forensics found blood traces
on it that matched to Lockston.

01:11:08.902 --> 01:11:10.541
And I checked his pathology.

01:11:10.542 --> 01:11:13.341
The damage to the bodywork
corresponds with the injuries

01:11:13.342 --> 01:11:14.861
that Lockston sustained.

01:11:14.862 --> 01:11:16.901
Did we find anything inside the car?

01:11:16.902 --> 01:11:19.781
Forensics reckon it was cleaned
before going into the barn.

01:11:19.782 --> 01:11:21.181
I'm sensing there's a but.

01:11:21.182 --> 01:11:24.182
But they missed one print.
On the gear stick.

01:11:24.462 --> 01:11:27.462
We ran it through the database
and we have a name.

01:11:28.142 --> 01:11:30.341
Henry Marsh!

01:11:38.902 --> 01:11:41.061
Guess what? That extension bloke -

01:11:41.062 --> 01:11:43.701
the one you went to see -
he just called. We got the job!

01:11:43.702 --> 01:11:46.461
I don't know how you did it,
but you've got a way with words!

01:11:46.462 --> 01:11:49.461
How could you do it?
She had to know the truth.

01:11:49.462 --> 01:11:52.261
No, jensen. She really didn't.

01:11:52.262 --> 01:11:54.341
You can't start
a relationship like that.

01:11:54.342 --> 01:11:57.021
There is no relationship.
She can't even look at me.

01:11:57.022 --> 01:12:00.021
All our plans,
everything I've worked for...

01:12:00.022 --> 01:12:02.501
Yeah, and what about me, Henry?

01:12:02.502 --> 01:12:04.261
Did I fit into those plans?

01:12:04.262 --> 01:12:07.262
Or was Ijust supposed to watch
you two go off and leave me?

01:12:08.502 --> 01:12:10.341
You owe me!

01:12:10.342 --> 01:12:12.501
I've stood by you!
I was there for you!

01:12:12.502 --> 01:12:15.502
Not Maxine. Me!

01:12:20.182 --> 01:12:23.182
He's making a break for it!

01:12:23.222 --> 01:12:26.222
Go! Go!

01:12:28.662 --> 01:12:31.662
Marsh, stop right now! Marsh!

01:13:02.942 --> 01:13:05.942
Henry Marsh, you're under arrest
for the murder of Frank Lockston.

01:13:09.262 --> 01:13:10.861
You do not have to say anything,

01:13:10.862 --> 01:13:13.862
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention...

01:13:14.852 --> 01:13:14.961
â™ªâ™ª

01:13:22.062 --> 01:13:25.749
Henry, we found Frank Lockston's
blood on the bonnet of that car.

01:13:25.782 --> 01:13:28.221
Then it must have been there
before I stole the car,

01:13:28.222 --> 01:13:30.461
because I didn't hit him!

01:13:30.982 --> 01:13:33.501
Look, I'd been in the pub
all night. I'd had a skinful.

01:13:33.502 --> 01:13:36.341
Mitch chucked me out,
I'm looking at a long walk home.

01:13:36.342 --> 01:13:39.101
Then I see it,
just parked up on the verge

01:13:39.102 --> 01:13:41.581
with the keys in the ignition.

01:13:41.582 --> 01:13:43.661
So I get in
and I drive myself home.

01:13:43.662 --> 01:13:46.662
Killing Frank on the way.
I didn't hit anyone!

01:13:47.542 --> 01:13:50.501
The next morning, Iwake up,
everyone's talking about Frank.

01:13:50.502 --> 01:13:53.061
I go outside.
I see there's a dent in the car

01:13:53.062 --> 01:13:54.941
and I panic.

01:13:54.942 --> 01:13:57.541
What was I supposed to do?
I'm six months out of prison.

01:13:57.542 --> 01:14:00.141
Even ifl haven't killed Frank,
I'm looking at car theft

01:14:00.142 --> 01:14:01.861
and drink-driving.

01:14:01.862 --> 01:14:04.862
So what did you do?

01:14:05.382 --> 01:14:07.821
I get jensen to help me
clean the car up.

01:14:07.822 --> 01:14:10.822
That night, we drive it to
some barn and we dump it.

01:14:29.982 --> 01:14:32.421
Maxine?

01:14:32.422 --> 01:14:35.422
Maxine, what's happened?

01:14:35.622 --> 01:14:38.421
Maxine!
I need you to do me a favour.

01:14:38.422 --> 01:14:40.221
Well, of course.

01:14:40.222 --> 01:14:43.222
Can you drive me
to Ingrid's house?

01:14:47.782 --> 01:14:50.782
Come on.

01:14:53.142 --> 01:14:54.741
What do you need exactly?

01:14:54.742 --> 01:14:57.742
Frank Lockston's time of death.
OK, hold on.

01:15:00.102 --> 01:15:03.102
Erm...

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:09.502
Somewhere between eight and ten
on the night of the 14th.

01:15:11.342 --> 01:15:14.342
And that's accurate, is it?
It's more of a ball park.

01:15:14.582 --> 01:15:16.501
So it could've been
after midnight?

01:15:16.502 --> 01:15:19.502
Well, no.
Body was found at 11:37.

01:15:19.942 --> 01:15:22.261
OK. Thank you.

01:15:22.262 --> 01:15:25.181
Henry Marsh may have an alibi.
What?

01:15:25.182 --> 01:15:27.021
Speak to Mitch McAllister.

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:30.022
Find out exactly when Marsh left
the pub that night.

01:15:33.422 --> 01:15:36.421
And jensen said
that Henry killed him?

01:15:36.422 --> 01:15:39.422
He said Henry made him hide the car
the morning after Frank died.

01:15:40.902 --> 01:15:42.901
Why do that if he was innocent?

01:15:42.902 --> 01:15:44.941
It's hard to believe.
I mean, Henry?

01:15:44.942 --> 01:15:47.501
No wonder he was so keen
to move away.

01:15:47.502 --> 01:15:49.061
Are you going to tell
the police?

01:15:49.062 --> 01:15:51.381
I want to tell Ingrid first.

01:15:51.382 --> 01:15:54.382
Frank was her brother.

01:16:01.782 --> 01:16:04.782
Mr McAllister?
Was Henry Marsh here till closing

01:16:05.342 --> 01:16:07.181
the night Frank Lockston died?

01:16:07.182 --> 01:16:10.182
It was a long time ago.
Try to remember. It's important.

01:16:10.222 --> 01:16:13.222
Henry was here.
You're sure about that?

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:16.702
He was in a right state.
Mitch had to throw him out.

01:16:18.182 --> 01:16:20.781
Thanks.

01:16:20.782 --> 01:16:23.782
Sir?

01:16:25.862 --> 01:16:28.862
Right. I'd better be off.

01:16:32.742 --> 01:16:35.742
Don't go.

01:16:36.982 --> 01:16:39.982
Just... don't.

01:16:45.702 --> 01:16:48.702
OK. Meet me at the cafe.

01:16:54.582 --> 01:16:56.981
Henry Marsh
may have stolen your car,

01:16:56.982 --> 01:16:59.581
but he has an alibi
for Frank's death.

01:16:59.582 --> 01:17:02.581
I-I don't know what that means.

01:17:02.582 --> 01:17:05.582
Frank was hit
before your car was stolen,

01:17:06.342 --> 01:17:08.941
bringing us back to you.
Me?

01:17:08.942 --> 01:17:10.861
I wasn't even in the village
that night.

01:17:10.862 --> 01:17:13.181
I was in London, with my brother.

01:17:13.182 --> 01:17:15.461
You can check.

01:17:15.462 --> 01:17:18.462
Barbara was driving?
NO. It wasn't Barbara.

01:17:19.902 --> 01:17:21.941
Then, who could it have been,
Dr Walton?

01:17:21.942 --> 01:17:24.942
It certainly wasn't my wife!

01:17:29.662 --> 01:17:32.662
Ingrid likes to pretend
her brother was a saint.

01:17:33.462 --> 01:17:36.061
But Frank was a mean man.

01:17:36.062 --> 01:17:38.901
He abused Maxine horribly.

01:17:38.902 --> 01:17:41.902
I mean physically. Brutally.
And often.

01:17:42.542 --> 01:17:45.542
Iwas Maxine's GP. I got to see
Frank's handiwork up close.

01:17:49.422 --> 01:17:51.701
Course,
Barbara worried sick about her.

01:17:51.702 --> 01:17:53.741
She kept an eye on Frank.

01:17:53.742 --> 01:17:55.421
Saw he'd been drinking that day.

01:17:55.422 --> 01:17:58.422
Knew what that meant
for poor Maxine.

01:17:59.262 --> 01:18:02.262
And so Barbara decided
to try and help her.

01:18:03.302 --> 01:18:06.302
How exactly did she help her?

01:18:22.862 --> 01:18:25.421
All on your own, Ingrid?
If you've come to gloat...

01:18:25.422 --> 01:18:28.422
No, no. No.
We've come to talk.

01:18:30.342 --> 01:18:33.342
Shall we do this inside?

01:18:41.582 --> 01:18:43.461
Barbara gave the car to Maxine?

01:18:43.462 --> 01:18:46.181
She wanted her to leave the
village before Frank got home.

01:18:46.182 --> 01:18:49.182
So maybe Maxine was on her way
and she saw Frank on the road?

01:18:54.982 --> 01:18:57.982
Henry Marsh?
I think it was an accident.

01:18:59.382 --> 01:19:00.981
Henry Marsh?
Oh, really?

01:19:00.982 --> 01:19:03.501
Running from the scene?
That was an accident?

01:19:03.502 --> 01:19:06.502
Covering up their crime.
Was that an accident?

01:19:06.902 --> 01:19:09.902
Leaving your husband, my brother,
to die in the middle of the road?

01:19:30.942 --> 01:19:33.261
You must arrest Henry Marsh!

01:19:33.262 --> 01:19:36.262
Where are Maxine and Barbara?

01:19:41.062 --> 01:19:42.861
Maxine, the night Frank died,

01:19:42.862 --> 01:19:45.221
you were due to leave
in Duncan Walton's car.

01:19:45.222 --> 01:19:48.061
That car killed your husband.
Did you run him over, Maxine?

01:19:48.062 --> 01:19:49.781
No! Of course I didn't!

01:19:49.782 --> 01:19:52.061
You played the grieving widow

01:19:52.062 --> 01:19:54.621
and all the time
it was you behind it?

01:19:54.622 --> 01:19:56.541
No!

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:58.381
Barbara gave me the car.

01:19:58.382 --> 01:20:01.101
I was supposed to leave.

01:20:01.102 --> 01:20:04.102
But I didn't. I couldn't.

01:20:05.382 --> 01:20:08.382
She took the car back. Barbara?

01:20:11.462 --> 01:20:14.462
Barbara?

01:20:36.822 --> 01:20:39.822
Winter!

01:21:03.382 --> 01:21:06.382
Barbara?

01:21:16.662 --> 01:21:19.662
Barbara.

01:21:20.062 --> 01:21:21.701
Let's just take a moment,
shall we?

01:21:21.702 --> 01:21:24.702
NO, don't come any closer!
Whatever you want.

01:21:25.222 --> 01:21:28.222
I want... I want to speak
to Maxine.

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:36.622
What happened that night?

01:21:38.222 --> 01:21:40.421
I suppose I should say
I didn't mean it.

01:21:40.422 --> 01:21:43.061
I suppose I should say
That it was an accident. But...

01:21:43.062 --> 01:21:45.421
I saw Frank on the way home.

01:21:45.422 --> 01:21:48.422
He was... drunk,
staggering all over the road.

01:21:49.102 --> 01:21:51.381
He was disgusting.

01:21:51.382 --> 01:21:54.261
I could have swerved or slowed.

01:21:54.262 --> 01:21:57.262
But instead...

01:21:59.382 --> 01:22:01.941
..I put my foot down.

01:22:01.942 --> 01:22:03.981
And he deserved it.

01:22:03.982 --> 01:22:06.982
Yes, he deserved it!

01:22:07.142 --> 01:22:10.142
The way he tormented you
all those years!

01:22:12.982 --> 01:22:15.982
You should have left!
I gave you the chance, Maxine!

01:22:16.662 --> 01:22:18.741
Why didn't you go?

01:22:18.742 --> 01:22:20.381
I don't know.

01:22:20.382 --> 01:22:22.021
I was scared.

01:22:22.022 --> 01:22:25.022
Oh, you were scared...
He had you terrified!

01:22:25.662 --> 01:22:28.662
And it broke my heart to see it.

01:22:31.982 --> 01:22:34.982
Harder to watch someone else
suffer. Do you ever find that?

01:22:38.542 --> 01:22:40.781
Ijust...
I wanted you to be safe.

01:22:40.782 --> 01:22:42.541
I know you did.

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:44.901
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.
This is all my fault!

01:22:44.902 --> 01:22:47.902
No! No, you were not
the cause of this. No.

01:22:49.342 --> 01:22:52.342
Barbara!

01:22:57.462 --> 01:23:00.462
Just don't come any closer!

01:23:05.422 --> 01:23:08.421
After I hit him, I panicked.

01:23:08.422 --> 01:23:11.422
I... I drove around.
I stopped the car.

01:23:12.502 --> 01:23:15.502
I got out. Ijust...
I left it on the roadside.

01:23:16.262 --> 01:23:19.262
And in the morning, I sat
waiting for the police to come.

01:23:21.502 --> 01:23:23.861
I knew they'd find Frank
and the car

01:23:23.862 --> 01:23:25.981
and Iwould be arrested.

01:23:25.982 --> 01:23:28.141
I was ready for it.

01:23:28.142 --> 01:23:30.861
But they never found the car.

01:23:30.862 --> 01:23:32.701
It was gone.

01:23:32.702 --> 01:23:35.702
It was gone and... if I kept quiet,
I was off the hook.

01:23:37.462 --> 01:23:40.462
And then Angus Colton found it.

01:23:41.462 --> 01:23:44.462
Yeah, he...
he arrived at the cafe,

01:23:45.702 --> 01:23:47.581
excited, looking for Duncan,

01:23:47.582 --> 01:23:50.582
saying he'd found Duncan's
old car in some barn.

01:23:51.982 --> 01:23:53.941
And suddenly you were on the hook.

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:55.950
Yeah.

01:23:57.422 --> 01:23:59.581
I knew it wouldn't take long.

01:23:59.582 --> 01:24:02.301
Not with all the forensics
these days.

01:24:02.302 --> 01:24:03.941
So, you killed Angus

01:24:03.942 --> 01:24:06.942
and then you decided
to take care of the barn?

01:24:07.862 --> 01:24:10.621
Yeah. I thought
that would be the end of it.

01:24:10.622 --> 01:24:13.622
Oh, Maxine, I'm so sorry!

01:24:14.062 --> 01:24:17.062
I'm so sorry!

01:24:18.582 --> 01:24:20.101
Don't!

01:24:20.102 --> 01:24:23.102
And then Azeem saw the image.

01:24:24.622 --> 01:24:27.622
I only went in there
to buy some dusters.

01:24:28.342 --> 01:24:30.181
And there he was,

01:24:30.182 --> 01:24:32.661
looking at the photograph
on his laptop.

01:24:32.662 --> 01:24:35.662
He didn't know what it meant?
NO.

01:24:35.782 --> 01:24:38.782
But he told me he was going
to take it to you, so...

01:24:40.462 --> 01:24:41.901
..that was that.

01:24:41.902 --> 01:24:44.902
A lot of death, Barbara.

01:24:48.022 --> 01:24:50.381
It's time for it to end.

01:24:56.742 --> 01:24:59.061
I'm just not sure I can face it.

01:24:59.062 --> 01:25:01.581
You know, what happens next,
I mean.

01:25:01.582 --> 01:25:04.582
The... court case. Prison.
The villagers finding out.

01:25:08.182 --> 01:25:11.182
And then there's Duncan.

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:14.181
What will it do to him?

01:25:14.182 --> 01:25:17.182
No.

01:25:17.702 --> 01:25:20.702
Duncan wouldn't want this.

01:25:24.062 --> 01:25:27.062
And you have to think of Maxine.

01:25:27.342 --> 01:25:30.342
Hasn't she been through enough?

01:25:31.982 --> 01:25:34.941
Don't do this.

01:25:34.942 --> 01:25:37.942
Don't make it any harder for her.

01:25:41.942 --> 01:25:44.942
Think of Maxine.

01:26:12.822 --> 01:26:14.781
You.

01:26:14.782 --> 01:26:16.781
You killed my brother.

01:26:16.782 --> 01:26:19.782
You took him away from me.
I stopped him hurting Maxine!

01:26:21.222 --> 01:26:24.021
She's a liar.
Frank was a good man.

01:26:24.022 --> 01:26:27.022
No. Frank was a thug...
and a drunk!

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:29.501
And a bully! Like his sister.

01:26:29.502 --> 01:26:32.502
OK, I think that's enough now.

01:26:33.382 --> 01:26:36.382
Put her in the car.
I have already cautioned her.

01:26:40.262 --> 01:26:43.181
Are you happy now?

01:26:43.182 --> 01:26:44.861
Of course not.

01:26:44.862 --> 01:26:47.862
That woman killed your husband.

01:26:48.342 --> 01:26:51.342
She did it out of love.

01:26:51.462 --> 01:26:54.462
Something you know nothing about.

01:27:15.622 --> 01:27:17.221
I'm all for standing by your mates,

01:27:17.222 --> 01:27:19.101
but I draw the line at murder.

01:27:19.102 --> 01:27:20.941
Well, that's good to know, Winter.

01:27:20.942 --> 01:27:23.942
Kam'S here.
Excellent. Now we can eat.

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:27.621
Didn't realise you were coming.

01:27:27.622 --> 01:27:29.581
Ditto.

01:27:29.582 --> 01:27:31.421
Can you, er, help me
with the salads?

01:27:31.422 --> 01:27:34.422
Yeah, sure.

01:27:34.862 --> 01:27:36.461
So, how was dinner?

01:27:36.462 --> 01:27:39.462
What dinner?
You and jamie. The ribs?

01:27:41.182 --> 01:27:44.141
He told you about that?
He tweeted about it.

01:27:44.142 --> 01:27:45.781
Winter tweeted about our dinner?

01:27:45.782 --> 01:27:48.061
Yeah. He used the word 'glorious'.

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:51.062
Really?
To describe the ribs.

01:27:51.702 --> 01:27:54.702
Yeah. They were great.

01:27:57.462 --> 01:27:59.381
This is gonna be fun.

01:27:59.382 --> 01:28:01.061
Are you ready with your salads?

01:28:01.062 --> 01:28:04.062
This is all ready. All perfect.
Don't want your kebabs to dry out.

01:28:04.142 --> 01:28:06.101
There you are. Burgers or sausages?

01:28:07.662 --> 01:28:10.541
I know what you want!

01:28:10.542 --> 01:28:13.381
Come on, then. Here it comes.

01:28:13.382 --> 01:28:14.382
