WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:03.046
Previously onCharmed...

00:03.090 --> 00:06.441
I summon the one
who brought me back.

00:06.484 --> 00:08.660
I have demon blood in me.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.401
You gonna be mad
at me forever?Maybe.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.229
You lied to me
and sold me

00:12.273 --> 00:14.231
and my sisters out to your
sociopathic demon father.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.537
MACY: I'll help
you find a way

00:15.580 --> 00:16.929
to take the demon out of Parker.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.235
But you will
find a way

00:18.279 --> 00:20.107
to take the demon out of me.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.327
MAN:
I'm gonna livestream this.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.288
MAN:
How can it be
that we just met?

00:27.331 --> 00:29.333
I am utterly captivated
by you, Chloe.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.118
So does that mean you're in?

00:31.161 --> 00:32.858
If you mean into you,
the answer's hells yeah.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.078
I'm talking about the road trip?

00:35.122 --> 00:37.124
The cross-country
pie tasting tour?

00:37.167 --> 00:39.256
I can't drop out now.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.650
Not when I'm finally ready
to finish my film.

00:41.693 --> 00:42.912
Bummer.

00:42.955 --> 00:45.175
Don't you see?
You've inspired me.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.655
When I'm with you...

00:46.698 --> 00:49.223
...I feel like
I can do anything.

00:49.266 --> 00:52.269
That's because you can
do anything, Judd.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.141
♪ Out on the moonlit floor...

00:54.184 --> 00:57.100
Even... fly.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.756
Come on. Let's do it.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.193
Yeah?
Okay.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.434
Hey.
Hey.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.870
What are you doing here?

01:27.913 --> 01:29.350
I need to talk to you.

01:29.393 --> 01:31.700
Look, just because
I don't hate you

01:31.743 --> 01:34.137
doesn't mean...
we can be together.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.530
That's not why I'm here.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.317
Why are you inviting me
to a party, then?

01:40.361 --> 01:42.014
It's a memorial service.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.625
For this guy Judd
in my film class.

01:43.668 --> 01:46.367
Judd and this girl
he was dating jumped off

01:46.410 --> 01:48.673
the old Mill Building
into the river yesterday.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.240
Oh, my God.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.155
His body washed up this morning.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.288
Hers hasn't been found yet.

01:54.331 --> 01:57.160
Was this like, a suicide pact?That's actually
why I'm here.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.683
There was something
off about it.

01:58.727 --> 02:01.121
Judd was livestreaming
when he jumped

02:01.164 --> 02:02.557
and his phone
caught something weird

02:02.600 --> 02:05.125
after he...
landed.
Weird like...?

02:05.168 --> 02:07.170
I don't know, it was like
a glowing light floating up.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.519
People were talking
about it in class.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.173
It sounded supernatural.

02:10.217 --> 02:13.959
Well, um, thanks
for the information.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.874
Yep.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.746
See you later.
See you.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.014
HARRY:
He may well be right.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.537
This could be
a demon attack.

02:26.581 --> 02:27.799
Oh.

02:27.843 --> 02:30.585
Harry, you scared
the crap out of me.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.413
Isn't it time for
you to move out?

02:32.456 --> 02:33.805
Again?

02:33.849 --> 02:35.546
I mean, you're all
healed from Tartarus;

02:35.590 --> 02:38.201
it would be nice to
have our attic back.I beg your pardon?

02:38.245 --> 02:39.724
I don't recall
you complaining

02:39.768 --> 02:41.509
while enjoying
your homemade breakfast

02:41.552 --> 02:43.424
of vegan sausage,
not that a vegan sausage

02:43.467 --> 02:46.166
has any business
calling themself a sausage.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.732
As I was saying,

02:47.776 --> 02:49.430
we need to investigate this.

02:49.473 --> 02:52.737
You think this could be legit?

02:52.781 --> 02:55.523
Not just Parker's excuse
to see me?

02:55.566 --> 02:56.828
Why do you ask?

02:56.872 --> 02:58.787
I just don't want to waste
our time.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.790
Maggie, need I remind you
he is half demon?

03:01.833 --> 03:03.270
Like that's something
I'd forget.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.489
Though Parker has been
quite helpful of late, I admit.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.230
Perhaps his human side
is growing stronger.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.319
That's a thing
that could happen?

03:09.363 --> 03:10.842
Theoretically.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.844
Alert your sisters straightaway.

03:12.888 --> 03:15.543
We need to make sure we're
at this memorial screening

03:15.586 --> 03:17.719
of Judd's unfinished film.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.722
"Woke, or: The Journey
of a Straight White Male Ally."

03:20.765 --> 03:22.637
Oh, good God.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.683
Never speak ill of the dead.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.643
It's not working.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.732
Cells go into a
temporary hyperdrive

03:30.775 --> 03:32.908
after a resuscitation occurs.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.605
If we're lucky,

03:34.649 --> 03:36.564
the mouse cells will
destroy the demonic cells.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.305
What do you see now?

03:40.959 --> 03:42.831
MACY:
It is working.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.963
It's killing Parker's
demon cells.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.704
It's great news.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.140
For Parker.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.752
How can it be I don't have
any demon cells to test

03:50.795 --> 03:52.493
when we know I have
demon blood in me?

03:52.536 --> 03:54.538
Parker's demon
nature is genetic.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.279
Yours was introduced
into your blood cell

03:56.323 --> 03:57.759
like, uh, an infection.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.761
We'll figure it out.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.763
In the meantime,
I can distill a serum

04:01.806 --> 04:03.852
from the mouse cells
and try it out on Parker.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.680
It may help suppress
his demon powers

04:05.723 --> 04:07.464
in the short term.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.044
Hey.
What's wrong?

04:23.611 --> 04:25.352
Oh, you know.
It's just that thing

04:25.395 --> 04:27.658
where you have demon blood
in you and one of the world's

04:27.702 --> 04:29.660
foremost scientific minds can't
find a way to get it out.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.271
Well, at least you still got
your sense of humor.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.011
Yeah.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.231
Look, we're gonna
figure this out.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.798
I'm here for you. Hmm?

04:36.841 --> 04:38.626
Thanks.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.976
I wish I could say
that gave me hope.

04:41.019 --> 04:44.327
But I... can't see a way
through it right now.

04:44.371 --> 04:47.287
Oh.

04:48.331 --> 04:49.680
JADA:
"Potential demon sitch"?

04:49.724 --> 04:51.856
What?

04:51.900 --> 04:53.815
You're gonna keep your
Charmed business secret from me?

04:53.858 --> 04:56.252
I'll tell you what.
I will tell you

04:56.296 --> 04:58.863
my Charmed business
if you tell me

04:58.907 --> 05:01.518
who the Sarcana
broke out of Tartarus.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.172
You know I can't
do that.

05:04.216 --> 05:06.349
I came clean
about being undercover.

05:06.393 --> 05:09.134
It's not just up to me.I know.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.223
But I should go, though.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.487
"Potential demon sitch."

05:13.530 --> 05:14.749
Do you have an
extra toothbrush

05:14.792 --> 05:16.228
I can borrow?

05:16.272 --> 05:17.969
You could use mine.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.799
Maybe I should leave one here.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.192
♪ Everybody get...

05:23.235 --> 05:25.368
Are we at the toothbrush point?

05:25.412 --> 05:27.370
I think I can
do a toothbrush.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.546
♪ Everybody get up,
everybody get up ♪

05:29.590 --> 05:30.765
♪ Done being down

05:30.808 --> 05:33.507
♪ Get up, get up

05:35.596 --> 05:37.119
♪ Get up, get up.

05:37.162 --> 05:39.382
So, if you're not
sleeping with Niko,

05:39.426 --> 05:41.210
then why'd you come home
with sex hair?

05:41.253 --> 05:43.386
Maggie, drop it.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.953
Jada.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.737
You're sleeping
with Jada.
Boundaries.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.391
MAGGIE:
Have you lost your mind?

05:48.435 --> 05:50.175
You're supposed to be
on an undercover mission.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.829
Wait, is it part
of the undercover mission?

05:51.873 --> 05:53.918
No.
Mel, you're gonna let

05:53.962 --> 05:55.833
sex brain cloud your
judgment about the Sarcana.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.835
My judgment
isn't clouded.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.402
And can we please
change the subject,

05:59.446 --> 06:01.448
because--
Meghan Markle.

06:01.491 --> 06:04.102
Oh, Harry.
Hmm.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.800
Look at you,
pulling off artsy.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.367
Oh, why, thank you.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.064
I am incognito.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.979
Right.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.763
Right, now, come on, ladies.
Let's get to work.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.678
Based on
my preliminary research,

06:14.722 --> 06:17.159
my guess is
some kind of hobgoblin.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.944
There's one that blinds you
with its glowing orb

06:19.988 --> 06:22.904
and disorients you
into sacrificing your soul.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.340
They tend to be young males
favoring

06:24.384 --> 06:26.777
distinctive... headwear.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.823
Oh, God.

06:28.866 --> 06:31.739
HARRY:
We've got our work
cut out for us.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.960
I'll never forget
all those...

06:36.004 --> 06:40.008
great times Judd and I had
talking about

06:40.051 --> 06:42.489
what bowling represented
in Lebowski.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.447
He was so deep.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.580
To Judd.

06:46.623 --> 06:49.365
GUESTS:
To Judd.

06:55.763 --> 06:59.419
Now, now, never speak ill
of the dead.

07:02.073 --> 07:04.206
Hey, guys.
Oh.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.860
Parker, I...

07:05.903 --> 07:07.905
I...  ...forgot
you were gonna be here.

07:07.949 --> 07:10.473
I invited you guys,
remember?
Yeah.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.040
So, listen.
That's Noah.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.824
The guy who told me
about the weird light

07:13.868 --> 07:15.260
on the livestream.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.914
The guy with
the soul patch

07:16.958 --> 07:19.221
and ironic
90's boy band tee?
No.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.658
The guy with the fedora
and the handlebar mustache.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.878
You should
talk to him.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.142
MACY:
I don't even need

07:27.185 --> 07:28.970
your boundary-violating
empath powers to know

07:29.013 --> 07:31.059
that you are
still into Parker.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.061
Th-That's crazy, why
would you say that?

07:33.104 --> 07:35.019
Because you're staring at him
like you're on a hunger strike

07:35.063 --> 07:36.804
and he's a human-sized bag
of cheese puffs.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.109
MAGGIE: It
doesn't matter.

07:38.153 --> 07:41.025
He's a demon.Ooh, uh, half-demon.

07:41.069 --> 07:44.464
I just, I-I can't get over
how we met.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.248
And how he lied
and used me.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.642
So every time he comes
to rescue me, I...

07:50.731 --> 07:54.474
...it just reminds me of how
weak and stupid he made me feel.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.519
Fair enough.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.870
Come on. Let's go find Noah.

07:59.914 --> 08:03.004
So how long had Judd been
working on this masterpiece?

08:03.047 --> 08:05.528
ZACK: Uh, this was,
like, three days.

08:05.572 --> 08:06.834
So a lot of time, yeah.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.749
Ah.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.185
I didn't know Judd
that well.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.535
I was more of a...

08:12.579 --> 08:14.015
fan.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.060
Is that how he and Chloe
started dating?

08:16.104 --> 08:18.454
She was drawn to his...

08:18.498 --> 08:19.934
talent?

08:19.977 --> 08:21.979
I guess they were dating.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.154
Um, but it must
have been new.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.026
Last I heard, she
was with this guy,

08:25.069 --> 08:26.375
Peter, who dropped
the class.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.072
So she was
a film school groupie?

08:28.116 --> 08:29.204
She wasn't a student.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.554
I think she was...
a dog walker?

08:31.598 --> 08:33.948
Or wait. She owned
a cupcake shop.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.341
And she made
her own candles.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.169
No one knew
her that well.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.782
MACY:
I just can't believe...

08:41.825 --> 08:43.610
Judd.
Judd, uh...

08:43.653 --> 08:45.437
really jumped.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.396
Especially since he had
so much to live for.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.571
You know, like,

08:48.615 --> 08:49.920
finishing his masterpiece.

08:49.964 --> 08:52.749
NOAH: I completely agree.
It makes no sense.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.578
He was a shoo-in to get into the
advanced seminar next semester.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.014
Aronofsky was gonna
guest lecture,

08:57.058 --> 08:58.233
he'd never give that up.

08:58.276 --> 09:01.018
Uh-- I heard this rumor

09:01.062 --> 09:03.455
that someone saw the
livestream of them jumping.

09:03.499 --> 09:04.674
That was me.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.589
Oh, my gosh.You're kidding.

09:06.633 --> 09:10.114
Well, what did you see?I think Chloe had him on drugs,

09:10.158 --> 09:12.116
or something, they looked like
they were trying to fly.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.292
And this weird light
floated up.
Uh...

09:14.336 --> 09:16.077
A weird light?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.905
What do you mean?

09:17.948 --> 09:20.908
If I believed in the soul,
I'd think it was his.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.127
Floating up to Nirvana, man.

09:23.171 --> 09:25.086
I've got a screenshot
if you want to see it.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.088
Yeah, we want to see.

09:27.131 --> 09:30.874
Because, I mean, if that
really was his soul,

09:30.918 --> 09:32.963
that would be, like, whoa.

09:33.007 --> 09:36.053
Meet me outside in ten. I've got
to get my phone from the car.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.664
Just started a tech cleanse.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.103
Okay, uh,
I'll grab Harry,

09:42.146 --> 09:43.887
you grab Mel,
we meet up outside.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.107
Okay, okay.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.762
Yeah, uh,
time to go.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.377
Isn't it sad

09:55.420 --> 09:57.553
how addicted to our screens
we are?

09:57.597 --> 10:00.600
Here. Let me take
that phone from you.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.951
Chloe, you're alive?

10:03.994 --> 10:05.735
Do you want to feel alive, too?

10:05.779 --> 10:09.043
Let's go splash in puddles right
in the middle of the street.

10:09.086 --> 10:11.132
That's a great idea.

10:13.961 --> 10:18.052
He said he was going
out to his car.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.410
Look.

10:28.453 --> 10:31.065
Could that be her?

10:41.728 --> 10:43.991
MEL:
What kind of demon uses...

10:44.034 --> 10:46.210
MAGGIE:
Body glitter?

10:46.254 --> 10:49.474
Noah is in a coma
and expected to recover.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.128
The protection spell
I added to his IV

10:51.172 --> 10:52.913
should immunize him
against a further attack.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.741
Now we need to figure out

10:54.784 --> 10:56.568
exactly what kind of attack
we're dealing with.

10:56.612 --> 11:00.181
This luminescent residue
seems to act as a pheromone.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.357
Is that consistent with
the hobgoblin you mentioned?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.664
No.

11:04.707 --> 11:07.057
That sounds like pixie dust.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.844
MAGGIE: Did you
say pixie dust?

11:10.887 --> 11:13.716
A pixie killed
Judd and Chloe?Wait.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.501
No, no, Chloe's
the pixie.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.503
She killed Judd.
I mean...

11:18.547 --> 11:21.811
hello, body glitter.HARRY: Maggie's right.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.334
And Chloe's body
was never found.

11:23.378 --> 11:24.858
That bright light we all saw

11:24.901 --> 11:27.382
was her fleeing the scene,
but it's strange.

11:27.425 --> 11:30.254
Pixies are known to be
the most benevolent and kind

11:30.298 --> 11:33.823
of all magical creatures,
and everything there is

11:33.867 --> 11:35.477
to know about them

11:35.520 --> 11:37.087
is in here.

11:43.528 --> 11:47.315
Pixies use their magical dust to
spread whimsy and inspiration.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.883
They live in the world

11:49.926 --> 11:53.756
as a certain type
of winsome young woman.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.760
Etsy and Pinterest
are filled with pixies,

11:57.804 --> 11:59.631
and they're responsible
for many of the things

11:59.675 --> 12:01.764
that bring us joy:
butterflies,

12:01.808 --> 12:04.375
ladybirds, wishing upon a star,

12:04.419 --> 12:05.812
the smell of rain,

12:05.855 --> 12:08.249
Tom Cruise jumping
on Oprah's couch,

12:08.292 --> 12:10.033
the flower baby's breath,

12:10.077 --> 12:12.732
all from pixies!

12:12.775 --> 12:14.734
Now, let us join hands and

12:14.777 --> 12:16.257
♪ Sing

12:16.300 --> 12:17.824
this next part.

12:24.091 --> 12:28.530
Yes, and as witches,
you three are immune,

12:28.573 --> 12:30.532
as are all demons.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.882
But evidently not Whitelighters.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.144
Mm.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.843
Apologies. The stuff
is utterly infectious.

12:36.886 --> 12:39.933
Why would a pixie
kill someone?

12:39.976 --> 12:41.804
Well, it's up to us
to figure that out.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.894
I'll shadow Noah at the hospital
in case Chloe shows up again

12:44.938 --> 12:46.853
to finish the job.I'll test this residue

12:46.896 --> 12:48.768
at work tomorrow
to identify the pheromone

12:48.811 --> 12:51.422
and see if I can figure out
what kind of pixie it is,

12:51.466 --> 12:52.815
because I'm guessing
there are...

12:52.859 --> 12:55.992
Hundreds, yes.

12:56.036 --> 12:58.821
You could see if Parker
has any other ideas?

12:58.865 --> 13:01.693
We don't need Parker.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.739
I will check Noah and Judd's
social medias

13:03.783 --> 13:04.827
and see if we can track down
Chloe that way.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.176
And I will plow
through this to see

13:06.220 --> 13:08.788
if there's some way
to lure a pixie.

13:18.623 --> 13:21.583
Hey. What are you doing here?

13:21.626 --> 13:23.498
We're just about to...

13:23.541 --> 13:25.021
see each other at work.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.631
Look, I've been thinking
about your demon thing.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.024
I might have a way

13:28.068 --> 13:29.591
to help you out.Galvin, that's sweet, but...

13:29.634 --> 13:31.419
I remembered something.
See, my grandme,

13:31.462 --> 13:32.986
she used to tell me
this bedtime story.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.639
I thought it was something
that she made up,

13:34.683 --> 13:36.424
but now I'm thinking maybe not.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.643
It was about a woman she knew
who had the ibi in her.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.428
The ibi?Yeah, she said

13:40.471 --> 13:42.822
this woman came to her
after a failed exorcism

13:42.865 --> 13:44.606
because my grandme
knew the Chiriji

13:44.649 --> 13:46.042
who could get the ibi out.

13:46.086 --> 13:50.264
Uh, "Chiriji" is--
means "surgeon."

13:50.307 --> 13:52.048
All right, um,

13:52.092 --> 13:54.442
I think maybe we should talk
to my grandme about it.

13:54.485 --> 13:57.445
You want us to talk
to your dead grandmother?

13:57.488 --> 13:59.273
I know it sounds crazy, but, um,

13:59.316 --> 14:00.883
I found someone online
who might be able

14:00.927 --> 14:03.712
to help us reach her.Mama Roz?

14:04.626 --> 14:07.803
Yeah, yeah, we-we go way back.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.545
Um, hm...
I don't know about that.

14:10.588 --> 14:15.376
Aw, come on, don't push me away.
Let me help.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.032
We're past that
now, aren't we?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.558
Hmm?
Yes.

14:23.601 --> 14:24.646
I'll drive.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.518
Yes.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.607
MAGGIE:
Mystery solved!

14:29.651 --> 14:31.958
You're welcome.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.916
I figured out
who Chloe's targeting.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.136
Wait, hold on. Harry?

14:36.179 --> 14:39.139
No sign of Chloe
at the hospital.

14:39.182 --> 14:41.663
Please tell me the two of you
have a lead.

14:41.706 --> 14:44.144
I do.
Chloe's targeting white guys.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.623
Well, that really
narrows it down.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.974
It does, though. It's white guys
in the film department;

14:48.017 --> 14:51.325
specifically,
World Cinema 201.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.587
Look, based on my
cross-referencing

14:52.630 --> 14:54.110
across all social
media platforms,

14:54.154 --> 14:55.982
Chloe's been in contact
with three other white guys

14:56.025 --> 14:57.418
who recently dropped
the course.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.593
Peter, that guy
you heard about,

14:58.636 --> 15:00.551
this guy Freddie...

15:02.031 --> 15:03.728
"Met this magical girl."
Shortly after,

15:03.772 --> 15:05.817
he changed his Facebook status
to an Emerson quote:

15:05.861 --> 15:07.297
"In the presence
of nature,

15:07.341 --> 15:08.908
a wild delight
runs through the man."

15:08.951 --> 15:11.258
Which led me to his Tumblr,
where I learned that he dropped

15:11.301 --> 15:13.434
out of school last week
to walk the Appalachian Trail.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.739
HARRY: Hm.
Well, that does

15:14.783 --> 15:17.264
sound consistent with
a pixie's influence.

15:17.307 --> 15:19.092
The other guy is Troy,
who dropped film

15:19.135 --> 15:21.572
to create his own major:
"Living Your Best Life."

15:21.616 --> 15:23.052
MEL: Aw,
they were right.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.576
It really is hard
to be a white guy these days.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.535
Let's not go that far.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.536
MAGGIE:
There are only two

15:28.579 --> 15:30.930
left in the class.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.714
This guy Zack...

15:32.757 --> 15:35.282
He was giving that super
pretentious toast at The Haunt.

15:35.325 --> 15:39.460
And Parker, but you said
demons are immune, so...

15:39.503 --> 15:41.070
Warn him just in case,

15:41.114 --> 15:43.333
then find Zack and dose him
with the protection spell.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.770
I'll get back to the hospital.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.382
We still need to work out
a way to stop Chloe.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.774
She's dangerous.

15:59.567 --> 16:00.785
Hey, Parker.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.184
Cute puppy.
Oh!

16:08.228 --> 16:11.666
His name's Eggers,
as in Dave Eggers, the writer.

16:11.709 --> 16:14.451
Reading A Heartbreaking Work
of Staggering Genius

16:14.495 --> 16:15.757
changed my life.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.194
You can pet him.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.804
I always wanted
a Golden Retriever

16:19.848 --> 16:21.415
when I was a kid.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.591
Oh, I know.
I watched your short film.

16:23.634 --> 16:26.681
Do you want to take him
on a walk with me?

16:26.724 --> 16:29.727
Come on.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.438
Hey, there's Zack.
Let's go.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.056
A splash of Harry's
protection potion.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.059
That should do it.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.409
Unfortunately,
there's no way

16:59.453 --> 17:01.498
to protect him from terrible
taste in man jewelry.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.283
I'm sure it's a metaphor
for something

17:03.326 --> 17:05.111
we're not possibly
deep enough to understand.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.416
Come on, let's go.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.729
It's Jada.

17:14.772 --> 17:17.688
She says it's urgent.Ugh, fine, go.

17:17.732 --> 17:20.039
I'll let you know if anything
happens on the pixie front.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.693
Okay.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.739
Parker?

17:26.262 --> 17:28.525
Parker! Parker!

17:28.569 --> 17:31.615
Maggie! Oh, it's so magically
random to see you.

17:31.659 --> 17:33.182
Are you skipping?

17:33.226 --> 17:35.097
Oh, the question is,
why aren't you skipping?

17:35.141 --> 17:36.968
Don't you remember that
feeling when we were kids,

17:37.012 --> 17:39.536
our bodies light as air,
skipping along without a care?

17:39.580 --> 17:42.061
I made a rhyme!
Oh, crap.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.540
Parker, you're
on pixie dust.

17:43.584 --> 17:44.541
But you're half demon,

17:44.585 --> 17:46.543
Harry said you'd be immune.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.589
Oh, so random
you should ask.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.547
My mom's been working on
this experimental treatment

17:50.591 --> 17:52.071
to suppress my demon powers.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.421
She is?
Yeppers!

17:54.464 --> 17:56.423
And I guess
it's working. Yay!

17:56.466 --> 17:59.165
Oh, wait, I'm supposed to be
chasing my puppy dog.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.733
MAGGIE:
Parker, no!

18:09.958 --> 18:11.655
Look at me, look at me.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.831
you don't want to do this,
and that is not your puppy dog.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.355
That's a good boy!

18:17.008 --> 18:18.271
MAGGIE:
Parker, stay with me. Listen.

18:18.314 --> 18:20.490
Snap the hell out of it.

18:20.534 --> 18:23.102
A pixie's trying to kill you
with her body glitter.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.669
What's going on?

18:25.713 --> 18:28.542
It worked. I broke
the spell with my powers.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.761
What just happened,
and why am I so tired?

18:30.805 --> 18:32.589
I just saved your ass,

18:32.633 --> 18:34.765
and I'm guessing
you're in whimsy withdrawal.

18:35.897 --> 18:38.378
Here. Drink this
and go take a nap.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.510
JADA:
Thanks for coming.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.164
I shouldn't have
made it sound urgent.

18:42.208 --> 18:46.690
It's just family BS.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.911
Y-Your detective-ex
called

18:49.954 --> 18:53.610
to tell me my parents
want to meet up.

18:53.654 --> 18:58.267
Oh, wow, and you
don't want to see them?

18:58.311 --> 19:00.922
I don't know what I want.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.924
I mean, they think
I'm in a cult,

19:02.967 --> 19:06.275
and they don't know I'm a witch.

19:06.319 --> 19:07.755
I was adopted.

19:07.798 --> 19:11.846
I was really close
to my family, too.

19:11.889 --> 19:15.806
Then I discovered my powers.
It freaked me out.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.460
I didn't tell them.

19:17.504 --> 19:20.376
How could they
ever understand?

19:20.420 --> 19:22.813
I was messed up
for a while.

19:22.857 --> 19:26.817
Did a lot of drugs,
acted crazy,

19:26.861 --> 19:30.038
and then I ran away.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.562
The Sarcana's what saved me.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.609
I'm really sorry, Jada.

19:37.654 --> 19:41.049
So, um, I was wondering...

19:43.051 --> 19:45.271
...want to meet the parents?

19:46.663 --> 19:48.143
Oh, no, never mind.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.797
I get it.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.147
Forget I asked.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.802
I warned you to leave him be.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.239
We need your help.
Have you heard of the Chiriji?

19:57.283 --> 20:00.242
Chil'! Do you take me
for an amateur?

20:00.286 --> 20:03.245
Of course Mama Roz is familiar
with the purveyor

20:03.289 --> 20:05.291
of the ancient blood ritual
to cast out the ibi.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.728
That's great.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.512
So how do we
perform the ritual?

20:11.558 --> 20:15.475
Mama Roz never said she knows
how to perform the ritual.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.477
It's a very few

20:17.520 --> 20:19.783
that possess this knowledge.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.350
And my late grandmother
was one of them.

20:21.394 --> 20:25.049
Then let us seek her counsel

20:25.093 --> 20:26.877
from the great beyond.

20:32.970 --> 20:37.845
Beloved who has crossed over
to the spirit realm,

20:37.888 --> 20:40.804
reveal thyself.

20:45.156 --> 20:47.333
Close your eyes if you want
to talk to your grandmother.

20:50.640 --> 20:54.775
Spirit, reveal thyself.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.690
I command you, spirit,

20:56.733 --> 20:59.519
in the name of your grandson.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.751
What do we do?

21:14.795 --> 21:19.278
We wait.

22:09.197 --> 22:11.068
Oh, no...

22:24.821 --> 22:25.996
No!

22:39.836 --> 22:42.099
Galvin!

23:15.132 --> 23:18.048
GRANDME:
You are letting
your heart lead you astray

23:18.092 --> 23:20.050
with a woman
who's got the ibi in her.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.966
She wants to get rid of it,
and I want to help her.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.011
I know you know how.

23:26.013 --> 23:28.885
GRANDME: Only the Chiriji knows
how to perform the ritual.

23:28.929 --> 23:33.063
He trusts no one.
He trusted me.

23:33.107 --> 23:36.153
Well, I'm your family,
he'll trust me, too.

23:36.197 --> 23:40.375
GRANDME:
Yes, but he will devise
a series of tests.

23:41.637 --> 23:45.424
If you fail,
it will cost you your life.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.600
Did he test you?

23:47.643 --> 23:50.559
GRANDME:
Indeed, he did.

23:50.603 --> 23:53.562
Didn't you always wonder
how I lost my finger?

23:57.610 --> 24:00.961
Galvin, can you hear me?

24:01.004 --> 24:03.485
Help him!

24:03.529 --> 24:05.052
Galvin, please.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.495
Oh, thank God.
Are you all right?

24:15.541 --> 24:17.064
I know how to help you now.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.114
I told him
absolutely not.

24:24.158 --> 24:27.509
Why not? Unless you want
to turn into a demon?

24:27.553 --> 24:31.252
Of course not.
It's just too dangerous.

24:31.295 --> 24:33.559
He has to find some
agoraphobic shaman

24:33.602 --> 24:37.084
on an uncharted island
and prove he can face evil.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.521
His grandmother did it
and lost a finger.

24:39.565 --> 24:42.306
No, Dr. Julia and I
can figure it out,

24:42.350 --> 24:44.570
and I don't want him to feel
like he has to save me,

24:44.613 --> 24:46.223
you should
understand that.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.530
You don't like it when Parker
swoops in and saves you.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.663
That's different. He's a demon.Not at the moment.

24:50.706 --> 24:52.578
Well, you said his mom's
dead mouse serum

24:52.621 --> 24:54.580
is gonna wear off any minute.

24:54.623 --> 24:58.671
Wait. Look at this,
it's a Pixie Trap.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.287
"Pixies are lured
by all things sweet,

25:06.330 --> 25:08.507
"shiny objects, treacly treats,

25:08.550 --> 25:10.857
"jingling, jangling
sounds of cheer,

25:10.900 --> 25:15.339
will bring you a pixie
all 'round the year."

25:15.383 --> 25:16.602
Drop the scones, ladies.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.822
We have a trap
to set.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.725
That should do it.

25:52.768 --> 25:56.555
If the trap doesn't get her,
the sugar coma will.

25:56.598 --> 25:59.035
I think we're good.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.385
Now, the spell.

26:06.129 --> 26:07.609
It says we just giggle.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.699
Seriously?Yeah. In delight.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.226
I'd say that-that
was more of a chortle.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.361
HARRY: Shh, shh, shh!

26:20.404 --> 26:23.364
Shh, she's coming.

26:32.068 --> 26:34.244
HARRY: Got her.MEL: That's her.

26:34.288 --> 26:35.376
Uh-oh.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.638
No way, it worked.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.118
HARRY: Be careful,
she's dangerous.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.690
You're the Charmed Ones!

26:44.733 --> 26:46.256
Oh, wow, that's so random.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.564
Why would you trap me? I'm good.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.611
Actually, no.
You killed a guy.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.136
Cookies!

26:56.179 --> 26:58.268
I was just doing
what I was told.

26:58.312 --> 26:59.574
MAGGIE:
What you were told?

26:59.618 --> 27:03.622
MACY: By who?

27:03.665 --> 27:05.667
The one who stole
my heart, that's who.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.148
I do what it takes to help him
live his best life

27:08.191 --> 27:10.019
'cause he deserves it, guys.

27:14.197 --> 27:18.071
Wait! Epic idea!

27:18.114 --> 27:22.075
You know what would be
next-level amazeballs?

27:23.206 --> 27:24.773
Steal that big old book
over there

27:24.817 --> 27:26.862
and get me out
of here, 'kay?

27:26.906 --> 27:28.385
Harry.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.300
MEL: Harry, what
are you doing?

27:30.344 --> 27:32.651
Oh.

27:34.696 --> 27:35.697
MAGGIE:
Oh, no, they're gone.

27:44.967 --> 27:47.622
I've had enough whimsy
to last a lifetime.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.189
Anything on this page?

27:49.232 --> 27:50.712
We've got to figure out
where Chloe took Harry.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.366
And the Book
of Shadows.

27:52.409 --> 27:53.802
Who knows what Tinker-hell
will do with them.

27:53.846 --> 27:55.195
MEL:
Chloe said she was doing

27:55.238 --> 27:57.414
what she was told by some guy
who has her heart.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.981
Right. She probably took
the Bookand Harry to him.

27:59.025 --> 28:01.201
If only we could figure out
who she was in love with.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.072
Wait, what if Chloe
wasn't being a drama queen

28:03.116 --> 28:05.553
when she said this guy
stole her heart?

28:05.596 --> 28:07.120
What if he actually stole it?

28:07.163 --> 28:09.818
I-It says here "Woodland Pixies
have an external heart.

28:09.862 --> 28:12.647
"If someone takes it,
they lose all sense of self,

28:12.691 --> 28:16.259
"existing only to please that
person, becoming one-dimensional

28:16.303 --> 28:18.000
with a single,
obsessive purpose."

28:18.044 --> 28:19.480
Oh, my God,

28:19.523 --> 28:22.744
she becomes a literal
Manic Pixie Dream Girl.

28:22.788 --> 28:27.314
"A Woodland Pixie's heart
resembles... an acorn"?

28:27.357 --> 28:29.055
Aw.
That's cute.

28:29.098 --> 28:30.796
Wait.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.232
MEL and MAGGIE:
Zack's man-jewelry!

28:34.625 --> 28:36.802
Hey, Har, you know
what would be, like,

28:36.845 --> 28:38.586
so random?

28:38.629 --> 28:40.370
If you found a spell
in this book

28:40.414 --> 28:43.069
that made Zack, like,

28:43.112 --> 28:45.419
the greatest filmmaker
who ever lived?

28:49.249 --> 28:51.555
There we are.

28:51.599 --> 28:54.036
A wish-fulfillment spell.Oh.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.779
Works for me.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.433
But it requires

28:59.476 --> 29:01.000
a dark sacrifice.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.350
The lifeblood of
a magical being.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.482
Like a pixie?

29:06.875 --> 29:08.790
Or...

29:08.834 --> 29:11.445
a Whitelighter?Oh, yes.
Either would do.

29:11.488 --> 29:14.100
But then again,
I do have more blood.

29:15.797 --> 29:18.060
And Parker's sure
he's gonna be here?

29:18.104 --> 29:19.714
Yeah, Zack works
the afterhour shifts

29:19.758 --> 29:20.976
in the archives every night.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.239
PARKER:
Hey, guys.Parker.

29:23.283 --> 29:25.546
We're okay; you don't even
have your powers.

29:25.589 --> 29:28.114
Serum's worn off, I can...No, I don't need you
constantly swooping in

29:28.157 --> 29:30.116
to rescue me, I mean us.Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't swoop.

29:30.159 --> 29:32.074
When have I ever swooped?You swoop, you
definitely swoop.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.381
Macy, I wouldn't do that,
there's an alarm.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.084
Disabled the alarm.

29:42.128 --> 29:44.478
Sorry for swooping
past you.
Fine.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.828
We're down a Whitelighter.
I guess you can assist us.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.136
Great.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.964
Sorry, Har.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.575
At least your death
won't be in vain.

29:54.618 --> 29:56.969
Not at all.
It's gonna make me into

29:57.012 --> 29:59.798
the next
great American filmmaker.MEL: Zack, stop.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.106
ZACK:
Was that...

30:04.150 --> 30:07.153
supposed to do something, or...?

30:07.196 --> 30:08.589
MEL:
The protection spell.

30:08.632 --> 30:09.982
It's protecting him
from our magic.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.814
Chloe, destroy them.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.467
And make the Whitelighter
keep my Booksafe.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.906
Hey, Har.
Mm-hmm?

30:20.949 --> 30:22.168
Here's the Book.
Oh.

30:22.211 --> 30:25.214
How about a fanciful
game of keepaway?

30:33.788 --> 30:35.529
I'll handle Chloe.

30:35.572 --> 30:37.444
Parker and I will get the Book.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.446
I think I can sober Harry up
with my powers.

30:39.489 --> 30:42.144
Great. Then the
wannabe-Tarantino is mine.

30:42.188 --> 30:43.580
No, your powers
won't work.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.147
He's a whiny film student
who forces

30:45.191 --> 30:46.627
a fairy to do his dirty work.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.194
I can handle him.

30:48.237 --> 30:50.718
Hi, Har.Hey, Harry.

31:03.687 --> 31:06.429
You overgrown lightning bug.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.127
♪ London Bridge
is falling down... ♪

31:08.170 --> 31:10.042
No, no, no.
Hold still, Har.

31:10.085 --> 31:12.044
♪ Falling down,
falling down... ♪No, no--

31:16.962 --> 31:18.441
Oh--

31:18.485 --> 31:21.053
♪ London Bridge
is falling down ♪

31:22.924 --> 31:24.970
Was I this annoying
on pixie dust?

31:25.013 --> 31:26.797
No, you were
even worse.

31:26.841 --> 31:29.365
It's time to retire
the manic pixie dream girl trope

31:29.409 --> 31:31.063
and, you know, murdering people.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.934
It was all Chloe. She's crazy.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.370
She's, she's--

31:37.373 --> 31:38.940
Zack, stop.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.811
Now hand over
that acorn.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.031
No, no.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.946
No!

31:44.990 --> 31:48.732
Girl, you should loosen up
and smile more. Boys like that.

31:50.125 --> 31:51.910
Oh.

31:51.953 --> 31:55.261
♪ My fair lady. I got him. Maggie.

31:55.304 --> 31:57.306
MAGGIE:
Harry, you're under
the pixie spell.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.569
Come back to us.

32:04.531 --> 32:07.186
Chloe, I have your heart.
Don't let Zack get away.

32:13.322 --> 32:16.238
I can't let you
leave, Zack.

32:20.547 --> 32:22.070
And that's a wrap on Zack.

32:31.384 --> 32:35.257
He's sleeping off
the whimsy.

32:36.824 --> 32:41.742
Oh. You're waiting for me
to tell you what to do.

32:41.785 --> 32:45.180
Okay, Chloe,
tell us what happened.

32:45.224 --> 32:47.226
Oh, geez.

32:51.752 --> 32:55.756
Well, I was living my best life,

32:55.799 --> 32:57.888
working at my pop-up
cupcake kiosk,

32:57.932 --> 33:01.066
a little dog-walking
on the side, I like to knit.

33:01.109 --> 33:03.894
And then Zack trapped me.

33:03.938 --> 33:06.636
He'd found a Pixionary
at an occult shop.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.378
He set it up and I was
the unlucky pixie

33:09.422 --> 33:10.684
that walked right into it.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.688
The Pixionary told him
he could steal my heart,

33:14.731 --> 33:17.212
so he ripped off my acorn,
and I was his.

33:19.345 --> 33:21.608
He said he wanted to get
into that film seminar,

33:21.651 --> 33:25.829
but he was convinced that
they'd only pick one white guy.

33:25.873 --> 33:28.876
I think it's really hard
being a white guy nowadays.

33:28.919 --> 33:31.879
That's not a thing.That's-- He's delusional.

33:31.922 --> 33:34.925
I didn't want to do
all those bad things,

33:34.969 --> 33:36.840
but I couldn't say no.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.889
So can I have my heart back?

33:43.934 --> 33:46.633
MEL:
Of course, Chloe.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.201
Go live your own best life.

34:00.777 --> 34:03.041
Oh...

34:04.912 --> 34:08.481
Oh, no...

34:08.524 --> 34:11.527
Oh, how can I live with myself?

34:11.571 --> 34:12.746
I killed somebody.

34:12.789 --> 34:16.880
Oh, Chloe,
it-it wasn't your fault.

34:16.924 --> 34:19.970
He stole your agency.
He is responsible.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.799
I have to make sure something
like this never happens again.

34:25.846 --> 34:27.761
We use something called
the Power of Three

34:27.804 --> 34:29.893
to make us stronger.

34:30.938 --> 34:32.809
Maybe you and the
other pixies could...

34:32.853 --> 34:35.464
Team up?
And organize.

34:35.508 --> 34:37.814
Figure out where to hide
those hearts of yours.

34:37.858 --> 34:40.643
Team up.
Yeah.

34:40.687 --> 34:42.645
I like that.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.519
Thank you.

34:59.836 --> 35:01.969
Justice now.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.927
Consequences now.

35:03.971 --> 35:05.842
It is so.

35:10.847 --> 35:13.154
I killed Judd,
and when Noah found out,

35:13.198 --> 35:14.721
I pushed him into traffic.

35:14.764 --> 35:18.986
All because I'm a spoiled douche
with an inferiority complex.

35:20.944 --> 35:24.774
Good job. Now you're gonna
march down to the police station

35:24.818 --> 35:25.775
and tell them exactly that,

35:25.819 --> 35:27.516
except for the
last sentence.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.562
A little too on the nose.

35:34.306 --> 35:35.742
What the hell was that?

35:35.785 --> 35:38.527
It's a Sarcana hex.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.312
Jada and I used it
a few weeks ago

35:40.355 --> 35:43.315
on some creepy dude who
roofied women at The Haunt.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.664
You've done this before?

35:45.839 --> 35:48.624
Mel, hexing humans
is against the rules.

35:48.668 --> 35:50.496
How can you be sure
Jada's on our side?

35:50.539 --> 35:53.542
All I know is that she hasn't
given me a reason

35:53.586 --> 35:54.848
not to trust her.

35:58.982 --> 36:01.942
Hey, Parker, wait up.
I was wondering where you went
