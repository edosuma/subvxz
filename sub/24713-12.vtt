MARCUS, I'M GONNA SAY A WORD,
AND YOU RESPOND

19:39.094 --> 19:40.804
WITH THE FIRST WORD THAT COMES
INTO YOUR HEAD.

19:41.221 --> 19:44.057
LIKE, IF I SAY, "CAT,"
YOU MIGHT SAY, "DOG."

19:44.766 --> 19:45.726
OKAY?

19:46.560 --> 19:47.644
JAMES KILLICK.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.524
EXPLAIN YOURSELF, MARCUS,
RIGHT NOW.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.111
I WAS JUST THE LOOKOUT.
IT WAS ALL NICK.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.070
WHO'S NICK?

19:57.112 --> 19:59.907
NICK BOWEN.
DID JAMES SAY I HIT DANIEL?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.366
DON'T WORRY ABOUT JAMES.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.784
LET'S HEAR
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.371
SWIRLY --
YOU KNOW, JAMES --

20:06.455 --> 20:08.624
COMES UP TO ME AND NICK LAST
WEEK, SUCKING UP,

20:09.374 --> 20:11.001
YOU KNOW, SAYING WE SHOULD COME
BY DANIEL'S

20:11.001 --> 20:12.628
BECAUSE HE HAS ALL THESE NEW
VIDEO GAMES.

20:12.669 --> 20:13.962
SO, ME AND NICK GO,

20:14.338 --> 20:15.923
AND WE GAME A BIT,
AND THEN WE SPLIT,

20:15.923 --> 20:18.008
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT BUDS
WITH THEM OR ANYTHING.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.552
I USED TO HANG OUT
WITH SWIRLY.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.428
WHAT NEXT?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.055
WE'RE WALKING TO THE SUBWAY,

20:23.096 --> 20:25.891
NICK TELLS ME HE RIPPED OFF
DANIEL'S APARTMENT KEY.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.935
HE SAYS WE'LL
GO BACK THERE ONE DAY

20:27.935 --> 20:30.938
AFTER DANIEL'S LEFT FOR SCHOOL
AND SNATCH THE GAMES.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.814
AND WHAT HE SAYS GOES?

20:32.981 --> 20:35.567
NICK SAID HE'D KICK MY ASS
IF I DIDN'T DO IT WITH HIM.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.320
SO I SAID I'D JUST BE
THE LOOKOUT,

20:38.695 --> 20:40.656
BUT STANDING THERE IN THE HALL,
I FREAKED.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.366
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:42.532 --> 20:44.409
WE HAD A MEETING SPOT
FOR AFTER.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.996
HE SAID DANIEL WAS HOME,
AND HE HAD TO HIT HIM.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.457
SO THEN WE WENT TO CENTRAL PARK
AND DUMPED THE HAMMER.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.625
WHERE IN CENTRAL PARK?

20:51.959 --> 20:53.585
IN SOME BUSHES
BY THE DUCK POND.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.004
WHERE'S KILLICK FIT IN?
NOWHERE.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.465
WELL, HOW DOES HE KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED IN THE APARTMENT?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.759
I TOLD HIM.
WHY?

21:01.176 --> 21:02.386
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
GOT AROUND,

21:02.386 --> 21:04.596
NICK GAVE ME THE GAMES AND TOLD
ME TO SELL THEM.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.890
AND THEN SWIRLY SAW ME WITH THEM
AT THE ARCADE,

21:06.974 --> 21:08.934
HE ASKED WHAT HAPPENED,
AND I TOLD HIM.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.478
WHAT MADE YOU THINK HE WOULDN'T
GO TO THE POLICE?

21:15.315 --> 21:18.360
I GUESS WE USED TO BE BEST
FRIENDS A WHILE AGO.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.946
I TOLD HIM THE TRUTH,
HOPING HE WOULD JUST DROP IT,

21:20.946 --> 21:22.531
BUT I GUESS HE'S A RAT.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.616
A RAT THAT STOOD UP
FOR YOUR SCRAWNY ASS.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.202
HE CONFESSED TO IT, MARCUS.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.370
DIDN'T IMPLICATE ANYONE.

21:31.665 --> 21:32.666
OH.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.752
UP.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.879
WE'RE GOING TO THE PARK.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.065

WE'RE ASKING HIM SOME QUESTIONS
DOWN AT THE STATION HOUSE.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.624
WHAT KIND OF CASE?

22:14.624 --> 22:16.209
A KID AT HIS SCHOOL
GOT ASSAULTED.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.252
WE'RE TALKING
TO CLASSMATES.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.588
<i>YOU </i>HIT SOMEBODY?

NO.

22:21.298 --> 22:21.923
NO.

CLEAR IT UP.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.011
WELL IT DOES FOR ME.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.929
THE KID DON'T FIGHT
AND WOULDN'T BE AROUND IT.

22:28.055 --> 22:28.847
IT'S NOT IN HIM.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.098
WE JUST WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.767
ONCE HE'S CLEARED, WE'LL BRING
HIM RIGHT BACK.

HE 16?

22:33.268 --> 22:34.144
ALMOST.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.896
IF WE GET YOUR PERMISSION TO
TALK TO HIM,

22:35.896 --> 22:37.105
IT'LL GET HIM HOME FASTER.

22:39.107 --> 22:42.027

OR I'M COMING DOWN THERE.

SOMETHING ON HIM HE DIDN'T DO.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.678
YOU HEAR ABOUT
DANIEL HANCOCK?

23:08.762 --> 23:09.638
GOT AROUND.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.015
WHERE WERE YOU
THIS MORNING?
SCHOOL.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.809
SOMEHOW,
NO ONE SAW YOU THERE,

23:13.809 --> 23:15.310
AND YOU WEREN'T
MARKED PRESENT.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.480
I SKIPPED.

23:19.064 --> 23:19.856
I WALKED AROUND.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.566
I JUST DIDN'T WANT IT GETTING
BACK TO MY DAD.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.610

BUILDING?

23:23.944 --> 23:25.028
NO.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.489
DID YOU HAPPEN TO STROLL
BY CENTRAL PARK,

23:27.948 --> 23:29.991
MAYBE NEAR THE BUSHES
BY THE DUCK POND?

23:30.283 --> 23:31.618
I WAS MORE AROUND SoHo.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.663
YOU MUST HAVE AN EVIL TWIN,
BECAUSE A WITNESS SAW YOU

23:34.663 --> 23:36.748
AT DANIEL HANCOCK'S BUILDING
THIS MORNING,

23:36.748 --> 23:39.876
AND SOMEONE ELSE SAW YOU NEAR
THE DUCK POND DUMPING A HAMMER.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.838
THE FINGERPRINTS ON IT ARE
BEING ANALYZED RIGHT NOW.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.506
MAYBE THIS WITNESS

23:44.714 --> 23:47.050
IS SAYING I WAS AT THOSE PLACES
TO COVER HIS OWN ASS,

23:47.175 --> 23:48.760
'CAUSE IT WAS HIM WHO HURT
DANIEL HANCOCK.

THAT WON'T EXPLAIN
YOUR FINGERPRINTS ON THE HAMMER.

I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANY HAMMER.

23:52.806 --> 23:53.807
MARCUS SAYS DIFFERENT.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.772
I KNEW IT.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.482
I KNEW IT.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.860
YOU WENT IN
TO TAKE THE GAMES.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.820
DANIEL SURPRISED YOU,
YOU GOT SCARED,

24:06.987 --> 24:08.655
AND YOU HIT HIM
WITH THE HAMMER.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.616
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYS THAT
YOU ONLY GAVE HIM TWO SHOTS.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.869
THAT SAYS THAT YOU WEREN'T
TRYING TO KILL HIM.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.412
YOU JUST WANTED TO
GET OUT OF THERE.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.038
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
YOU TELL US NOW,

24:17.038 --> 24:18.540
AND THIS GOES DOWN
AS A DIFFERENT DEAL.

24:18.999 --> 24:19.791
I DIDN'T DO IT.

24:20.917 --> 24:24.254
HEY, NICK, WE GOT THE HAMMER,
AND WE GOT MARCUS.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.966
MARCUS IS A PUSSY
WHO'S PUTTING SOMETHING ON ME

THAT HE PROBABLY DID HIMSELF.

WANT TO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.949
LAST NIGHT YOU TOLD AN OFFICER
ON AVENUE "A"

24:52.949 --> 24:55.285
BY THOMPSON SQUARE PARK,
THAT YOU SAW A GUY

24:55.285 --> 24:56.828
SHOOTING AT ANOTHER GUY,
AND THEN YOU TOOK OFF.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.748

DESCRIPTION OF WHAT HAPPENED.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.090
YOU'RE HAZY WITH YOUR
DESCRIPTION.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.550
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THAT SHOOTING?

25:10.592 --> 25:12.427
[ SCOFFS ] NO.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

25:12.427 --> 25:15.096
THEN QUIT TRYING TO CONVINCE US
YOU WERE INVOLVED.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.348
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU
ANYTHING.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.391
THE ONLY REASON I TOLD
THE OFFICER LAST NIGHT IS 'CAUSE

25:18.391 --> 25:20.143
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA GIVE ME
A SUMMONS FOR SPEEDING.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.979
WE'RE GONNA PULL YOUR HACK
LICENSE IF YOU DON'T TELL US.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.606

WOULDN'T YOU?

MR. LIPE, WHY TURN THIS
INTO A PROBLEM FOR YOURSELF?

25:27.943 --> 25:29.986

ON THE STREET.

COOPERATE WITH OR ASSIST

BUT DID THE NYPD

AT SOME POINT, MR. LIPE?

END UP LOSING MY LIVELIHOOD.
