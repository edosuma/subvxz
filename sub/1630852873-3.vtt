WEBVTT

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
You lot got nothing better to do?

00:28.760 --> 00:31.000
You all right? You took quite a knock.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.880
Bust your leg too, right?

00:35.240 --> 00:36.120
Looks bad.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.120
Yeah.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.400
So I'm not going anywhere, am I?

00:42.680 --> 00:44.200
Where did you get the car?

00:44.720 --> 00:46.400
I borrowed it from a friend.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.360
Friend? What's his name?

00:48.440 --> 00:49.960
I don't remember.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.760
So you remember borrowing a car,
but not who from?

00:54.720 --> 00:55.760
Do you know what?

00:56.280 --> 00:57.400
Fuck you.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.880
Really?

01:01.040 --> 01:04.000
Fine. I'm arresting you
for the murder of Elias Fager.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.200
What? No!

01:05.280 --> 01:07.800
You were caught with a car
that was used in the hit-and-run.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.560
-What are you talking about?
-We have forensic evidence.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.760
CCTV footage
from the scene of the killing.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.400
Bullshit. I wasn't there.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.160
So where did you get the car from?

01:16.240 --> 01:18.200
We found the car on the estate.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.200
It was unlocked.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.960
Just begging to be jacked.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.040
I didn't kill no one.

01:43.120 --> 01:47.800
All we're gonna find of that car now is
skid-stained underwear and used needles.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.720
Why take the risk?

01:50.360 --> 01:53.800
Using a police car?
They could have taken a car from anywhere.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.400
Come on. We're not seriously saying
it's one of ours, right?

01:59.480 --> 02:02.080
Maybe they were just trying
to make a statement.

02:02.680 --> 02:05.760
Whoever killed Elias Fager
was taking the law into their own hands.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.840
Great. That's all we need, a vigilante.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.320
Welcome, detectives.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.520
Find anything?

02:34.280 --> 02:36.880
Yeah, so there's no doubt this is the car.

02:36.960 --> 02:40.800
We're waiting on blood analysis,
but I'm pretty sure that'll match too.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.920
What about the tracker? Have you
been able to download the telemetry?

02:44.520 --> 02:46.320
-What?
-It's a police car.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.920
Oh, he's just adorable.
Yes, it is a police car, Detective.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.360
One configured for fraud operations.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.120
Shit.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.760
Looks like your joyrider
had quite the party.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.240
We're finding blood and prints and DNA

03:03.320 --> 03:05.200
of everyone he invited.

03:05.280 --> 03:09.400
It's gonna be close to impossible
to isolate your killer amongst all that,

03:09.480 --> 03:13.960
but if you give me a suspect,
maybe I could tie them to the car.

03:14.040 --> 03:14.920
Otherwise?

03:15.760 --> 03:16.840
We're fucked.

03:31.720 --> 03:36.040
So this was the most recent case,
which I'd love for you to have a look at.

03:37.040 --> 03:37.920
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.240
Kurt, this is Mia.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.160
-Hey.
-Hi.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.920
Her firm's offered to do
some pro bono work for the charity.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.400
-Oh, wow, that's great.
-Yeah, it really is.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.880
She came by the office this morning
with some brilliant ideas.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.680
I can go to the bedroom
if you guys wanna work.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.880
No, no,
we were gonna head out for a drink.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.920
Mm.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.320
Kurt's a detective, so he might not
appreciate some of our ideas.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.320
A detective. That's exciting.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.200
Not so sure about that.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.560
Uh, hey, don't eat.
I'll bring us back some dinner?

04:08.640 --> 04:10.160
-Okay, yeah.
-Shall we head?

04:10.240 --> 04:11.080
Mm.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.120
We'll be about 30, 45 minutes.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
Take your time.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.760
There's a wine bar just down the street.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.040
Five-minute walk?

04:21.120 --> 04:22.720
Nice to meet you, Mia. Bye.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.400
-Bye.
-Bye. See you later.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.080
-Kurt.
-Hey.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.440
Listen, I, uh, wanted to apologize
for the other day.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.560
No, no, no, it was me.
I was tired, and I was drunk,

04:42.640 --> 04:45.080
and I shouldn't talk
about stuff I know nothing about.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.920
What are you talking about, man?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.880
You lived in the hood for what?
Five whole weeks?

04:49.960 --> 04:51.520
You're practically the street now.

04:53.320 --> 04:57.200
But listen,
um, I shouldn't have blown up like that.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.320
You still getting the headaches?

05:02.400 --> 05:04.520
Yeah, they come and go with stress.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.800
-Shouldn't you get them checked out?
-Forget about that.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.560
-What happened with DNA?
-Ugh.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.800
Damn thing's a petri dish.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.360
Isolating the separate DNA
is going to be a nightmare.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.880
Did you run telemetry?

05:18.680 --> 05:22.040
The tracker. It's a cop car.
The tracker will tell us where it's been.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.960
It's a fraud car, Rez,
set up for undercover work.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.440
Why risk installing a tracker
when you can use a smartphone?

05:29.400 --> 05:30.640
Catch you later.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.000
-The car's not really given us anything?
-Not yet.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.840
You've both seen this?

05:40.360 --> 05:41.480
The break-in?

05:42.000 --> 05:42.840
Yep.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.200
All right, theories.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.440
It could be someone
with a specific axe to grind,

05:48.520 --> 05:50.240
a family member, a friend of Moberg's.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.160
We really are pissing in the wind
unless we can get lucky with that car.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.040
Start with what you got,
work up a list of suspects.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.600
If Elias was killed for what he did,
where does that leave Sören?

06:00.120 --> 06:02.240
I do think we need Sören's alias, sir.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.760
I'm putting as much pressure
on the Ministry as I can,

06:04.840 --> 06:07.280
but with the leak,
we're not in a position to make demands.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.400
What kind of fantasy world
are they living in

06:09.480 --> 06:11.520
if they're still pretending
it was just a hit-and-run?

06:11.600 --> 06:14.080
Detective Wallander, breathe.

06:16.840 --> 06:17.680
Now,

06:18.200 --> 06:20.000
if you have something
you'd like to express,

06:20.080 --> 06:22.200
I suggest you do so in a civil manner.

06:22.800 --> 06:27.320
Sören's life could be in danger, sir.
We need to know who he is and where he is.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.000
If that information leaks,
then he'll wind up dead.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.280
We need to focus on finding our killer
with the information that we have.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.560
IA will be following us
every step in this investigation.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.200
We can't afford any mistakes.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.600
Okay, Jörgen Moberg
was clearly loved by a lot of people.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.560
Could someone be out to avenge him?

06:50.080 --> 06:53.240
Relatives? Old schoolmates,
people from his club?

06:53.760 --> 06:55.400
I'll start putting together a list.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.120
You take a look at the old investigation

06:57.200 --> 06:59.200
and see
if we can find anyone interesting there.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.960
<i>…that a man in his twenties</i>
<i>was pronounced dead</i>

07:02.040 --> 07:04.080
<i>after being struck at speed by a vehicle.</i>

07:04.160 --> 07:08.200
<i>Leaked reports suggest</i>
<i>the victim was Elias Fager,</i>

07:08.280 --> 07:11.040
<i>known for his involvement,</i>
<i>along with his brother Sören,</i>

07:11.120 --> 07:14.840
<i>in the torture and murder</i>
<i>of schoolteacher Jörgen Moberg.</i>

07:15.640 --> 07:19.760
<i>The driver of the car that killed Fager</i>
<i>has not been identified</i>

07:19.840 --> 07:22.440
<i>and is still at large. Any--</i>

07:38.200 --> 07:39.120
Hello?

08:02.600 --> 08:04.840
Go away! Do you hear me?!

08:04.920 --> 08:06.680
I'm calling the police!

08:12.080 --> 08:14.080
Katja? Are you all right?

08:15.960 --> 08:19.160
We just wondered
if you were still coming to the party.

08:25.240 --> 08:29.360
It might be worth looking at old students.
Didn't he teach adults to swim as well?

08:29.440 --> 08:30.760
<i>Yeah, he did.</i>

08:30.840 --> 08:34.120
<i>Uh, two swim clubs in Malmö</i>
<i>sent flowers to the funeral.</i>

08:34.200 --> 08:37.400
<i>Also taking a look at some guy,</i>
<i>had a kid in Moberg's swimming class</i>

08:37.480 --> 08:40.520
<i>wrote some pretty crazy stuff</i>
<i>about the Fager boys on Facebook.</i>

08:40.600 --> 08:42.440
-Okay, add him to the list.
-<i>Will do.</i>

08:42.520 --> 08:44.320
<i>Took a look at the teaching staff.</i>

08:44.400 --> 08:47.840
<i>Two of them have criminal records</i>
<i>for nothing major, nothing violent.</i>

08:47.920 --> 08:51.560
<i>And, of course, there's Moberg's wife,</i>
<i>but I can't see how she could be involved.</i>

08:52.080 --> 08:55.400
She said some pretty inflammatory comments
to the press following the verdict.

08:55.480 --> 08:59.120
<i>Yeah, she did, Kurt,</i>
<i>but most of the country agreed with her.</i>

08:59.640 --> 09:01.720
<i>What happened destroyed her entire family.</i>

09:02.240 --> 09:05.080
That's my point. What if she'd found out
he'd been released?

09:05.600 --> 09:08.400
<i>I mean, sure,</i>
<i>but how could she have found out?</i>

09:08.480 --> 09:12.320
I don't know. Someone did.
Listen, Rask, I think it's bedtime.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.480
I'm pretty tired.

09:13.560 --> 09:14.960
Not too tired, I hope.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.680
Oh shit. Yeah, I'm sorry, Kurt.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.680
-Get some rest, all right?
<i>-Bye.</i>

09:19.760 --> 09:21.080
Good ni… Hey, wait.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.360
What about the daughter, Alexia?

09:23.440 --> 09:26.480
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>uh, she's on the list, of course.</i>

09:26.560 --> 09:29.040
<i>-She'd be in her twenties now, but--</i>
-Yeah.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.920
<i>All right,</i>
<i>this is pretty comprehensive.</i>

09:32.000 --> 09:34.360
<i>I'm not sure exactly</i>
<i>what else we've got to go on.</i>

09:51.280 --> 09:52.480
We're ready for you.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.240
Uh, good to see you, Detective Wallander.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.400
We don't usually get repeat business.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.640
It's terrible what happened to Hemberg.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.960
I know you and him were close.
His death must've hit you hard, right?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.680
His murder. Yeah. Yeah.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.720
It did.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.760
I understand you have some strong feelings
about the inquiry, which you've aired.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.440
It's been made very clear to me

10:16.520 --> 10:19.480
that I'm not to be involved in
the investigation into Hemberg's murder.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.880
And I have full confidence
in the investigators working on it.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.560
You know
why we wanted to talk to you today.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.880
The leak of sensitive information
to the media.

10:30.760 --> 10:35.280
That is part of it, but more
specifically, it's about your colleague.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.400
How close are you
with Detective Inspector Rask?

10:37.480 --> 10:38.800
We're colleagues.

10:39.560 --> 10:40.800
I respect her.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.200
Mm-hmm.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.840
-And you trust her?
-Implicitly. Yes.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.120
Isn't it funny that DI Rask
and Superintendent Osei

10:50.200 --> 10:51.880
worked together in Stockholm

10:52.480 --> 10:54.120
before Rask was transferred here?

10:54.200 --> 10:57.760
-What does that have to do with anything?
-Come on. What's your assessment of her?

10:57.840 --> 11:00.080
What do you mean?
Privately? Professionally? What?

11:00.160 --> 11:03.360
I'm simply trying to ascertain if you
know her as well as you think you do.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.200
She's an extremely competent detective.
That's what I know.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.160
How much has she told you
about her work on the original Fager case?

11:13.400 --> 11:15.000
It was one of her first cases.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.680
High profile.
She was under a lot of pressure to close.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.280
And has she voiced any personal opinions
about the brothers?

11:21.360 --> 11:22.200
No.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.640
I'd like to show you something.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.880
<i>So here's the thing, Sören.</i>

11:31.120 --> 11:34.000
<i>I sit across the table</i>
<i>from people just like you all the time,</i>

11:34.080 --> 11:35.440
<i>and I know when they're lying.</i>

11:35.520 --> 11:37.600
-<i>I told you, I don't remember.</i>
-<i>You don't?</i>

11:37.680 --> 11:40.240
-<i>It's a bit of a blur.</i>
<i>-I suggest you fucking unblur it.</i>

11:40.320 --> 11:43.120
<i>I told you, you fucking bitch,</i>
<i>we beat him up, and he deserved it!</i>

11:43.200 --> 11:47.120
<i>Unless you own up to what you did,</i>
<i>you're both gonna go down. You know that?</i>

11:47.960 --> 11:49.080
<i>You and your brother.</i>

11:49.160 --> 11:52.520
<i>You've dragged him into the middle</i>
<i>of all of this, your little brother.</i>

11:54.200 --> 11:56.600
<i>Jörgen Moberg looked after both of you,</i>

11:57.200 --> 11:59.440
<i>and then you beat the living shit</i>
<i>out of him</i>

11:59.520 --> 12:02.000
<i>and locked him in that sauna</i>
<i>to die in agony.</i>

12:02.080 --> 12:04.120
<i>That's what happened, isn't it?</i>

12:06.320 --> 12:07.440
<i>What are you saying?</i>

12:10.440 --> 12:12.080
<i>-You're a fucking animal!</i>

12:12.160 --> 12:14.000
<i>Prison's too good for you!</i>

12:18.520 --> 12:20.160
You can see how angry she is.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.880
Outraged by what they did.
I can understand that.

12:23.880 --> 12:28.640
Look, if Rask should exhibit any more
unprofessional behavior on this case,

12:28.720 --> 12:30.040
you know where to find me.

12:30.120 --> 12:30.960
Are we done?

12:32.640 --> 12:33.760
Yeah, sure.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.320
<i>Yeah, the Elias</i>
<i>and Sören Fager interrogations</i>

12:42.400 --> 12:43.680
from the Moberg case.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.080
Yeah, that's the one. Thanks.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.080
You know what?
Just send the whole case file, the works.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.360
As soon as possible, please.
Thank you. Yep.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.800
<i>And then I stole the key.</i>

12:58.880 --> 13:00.360
<i>To the staff entrance?</i>

13:02.160 --> 13:03.400
<i>Where did you get it?</i>

13:04.640 --> 13:06.800
<i>Mr. Moberg kept a spare in his office.</i>

13:08.040 --> 13:10.360
<i>-On a hook.</i>
-<i>How did you get in there?</i>

13:13.160 --> 13:14.960
<i>He kept it unlocked sometimes.</i>

13:16.520 --> 13:19.600
<i>And the Halloween masks,</i>
<i>when did Sören buy those?</i>

13:19.680 --> 13:21.280
<i>We picked them up on the way.</i>

13:22.960 --> 13:25.680
<i>-We just wanted to scare him.</i>
-<i>Scare him?</i>

13:26.280 --> 13:29.240
<i>Look,</i> <i>I know he's your brother, Elias,</i>

13:30.800 --> 13:32.400
<i>but we know that he did it.</i>

13:33.360 --> 13:34.640
<i>There is no doubt.</i>

13:36.080 --> 13:39.200
<i>So I need you to tell me</i>
<i>exactly how it happened</i>

13:39.280 --> 13:41.200
<i>in your own words. Do you understand?</i>

13:41.720 --> 13:45.280
<i>Sorry, I really need to make</i>
<i>a call. Can we take a short break?</i>

13:45.800 --> 13:46.880
<i>Absolutely.</i>

13:46.960 --> 13:49.880
<i>Interrogation suspended at 11:27.</i>

13:54.080 --> 13:56.440
<i>Look, I know you're trying to protect him,</i>

13:57.840 --> 13:59.560
<i>but it's too late for that now.</i>

14:00.720 --> 14:02.760
<i>You have to be smart, Elias.</i>

14:03.880 --> 14:05.560
<i>You're 14. He's 16.</i>

14:05.640 --> 14:07.360
<i>You're a good kid. I can see it.</i>

14:08.400 --> 14:10.000
<i>And if you tell me what happened,</i>

14:10.080 --> 14:12.920
<i>Sören won't be able to ruin things</i>
<i>for you anymore.</i>

14:14.240 --> 14:16.400
<i>You don't have to be</i>
<i>dragged down with him.</i>

14:20.120 --> 14:23.640
<i>I need you to tell me that he did it.</i>

15:42.800 --> 15:43.800
Wake up.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.760
Kurt.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.000
Oh shit.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.120
Sorry, I…

16:03.920 --> 16:06.320
I'm just having a bad time
at work right now.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.280
Yeah, it's starting to show.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.000
It's not so bad.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.160
I'm just worried.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.960
Yes. I understand.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.320
Okay.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.440
Mm-hmm.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.160
Yes, yeah.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.560
Great. Great. I… Yeah.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.840
Perfect. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.360
Okay. Thank you.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.600
-Coffee?
-Thanks.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.200
Are you okay?

16:50.920 --> 16:52.040
Mm-hmm.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.120
That was Mia.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.320
Do you want to talk about it?

16:59.840 --> 17:00.680
Yeah.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.440
A young Afghan boy's
had his asylum claim refused.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.040
-They don't believe his story or his age.
-Shit, that's bad.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.040
Yeah, it is. Police got involved,
and we had to hide him--

17:11.120 --> 17:12.000
The…

17:13.600 --> 17:16.280
-Yeah, maybe I shouldn't say anymore.
-Probably not.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.640
Well, Mia's gonna help us
contest the extradition, so…

17:21.320 --> 17:22.640
-Okay.
-…fingers crossed.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.040
Yeah, great. Great.

17:25.880 --> 17:26.880
How are you?

17:27.920 --> 17:28.760
I'm fine.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.320
How's work?

17:32.440 --> 17:33.600
I'm not allowed to…

17:35.040 --> 17:37.200
Yeah. Yeah.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.120
This-- This, um…

17:47.960 --> 17:51.880
-We can't have a proper conversation.
-We can talk about other stuff, right?

17:51.960 --> 17:53.600
There are various things.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.520
Like?

17:59.080 --> 18:00.720
It's not funny!

18:01.320 --> 18:03.040
We will work it out.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.120
Okay?

18:16.360 --> 18:18.840
I saw an interview you did
with Elias Fager.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.480
So?

18:23.480 --> 18:25.600
You know Internal Affairs are all over it?

18:26.840 --> 18:29.240
Edman's trying to find motivation
for the press leak.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.680
Yeah, of course he is.

18:34.160 --> 18:37.240
You leaned on Elias
when the solicitor wasn't there.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.520
Of course I leaned on him, Kurt.
It was a murder investigation.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.600
-What, you want me to pat him on the head?
-He was 14.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.240
Edman's gonna see that tape.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.760
What was it about the Fager boys?

19:49.600 --> 19:50.800
What is it now?

19:50.880 --> 19:54.600
Normally when you question a suspect,
it's controlled, measured.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.680
But with them, it was different.
<i>You </i>were different.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.880
It was a tough case.
It was a long time ago.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.360
It wasn't personal.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.920
Moberg's wife,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.560
sharing in her grief,
visiting her against protocol,

20:09.640 --> 20:10.800
was that personal?

20:10.880 --> 20:12.440
What are you suggesting?

20:12.520 --> 20:16.560
Leaking information about Elias's killing
puts Sören in danger.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.600
I need to ask you,

20:20.360 --> 20:22.560
as a friend, and I'm not judging you,

20:23.080 --> 20:24.120
did you do it?

20:24.920 --> 20:27.240
Did you leak any information to the media?

20:27.320 --> 20:30.520
-I didn't leak it, Kurt.
-Do you think Sören got off too lightly?

20:30.600 --> 20:32.080
It doesn't matter what I think.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.360
If I was trying to get Sören killed,
it'd make me no better than him.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.120
But I get it, you had to ask.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.840
I was unprofessional then,
but that's not the case now.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.520
So let's try and find Elias's killer,
shall we?

20:45.040 --> 20:47.400
And if we're lucky,
we'll get the source of the leak too.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.960
Okay?

20:49.960 --> 20:50.880
Yeah.

21:41.960 --> 21:42.880
Fuck.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.560
POLICE

22:58.400 --> 22:59.920
-Rask?
-Yeah?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.760
-You need to see this. Come. Come.
-Mm.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.720
What have you got?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.880
These are photos
pulled from Fronten's social media.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.280
Modin's put them together

23:11.360 --> 23:13.840
to give us a timeline
from the night of the hit-and-run.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.240
This is Elias in all these pictures.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.480
And this.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.280
You see who this is?

23:21.360 --> 23:25.000
Sören. The guy I met in Elias's flat.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.080
Fuck.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.520
Sören was with Elias
the night he was killed.

23:31.720 --> 23:32.560
Sir?

23:33.240 --> 23:35.680
Detective Inspector Rask,
bringing me good news?

23:35.760 --> 23:36.760
Sören Fager.

23:36.840 --> 23:38.040
Still out of bounds.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.000
Maybe not.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.360
We placed him at Fronten
the night of the hit-and-run.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.840
Sören was released from prison a week ago,

23:44.920 --> 23:48.080
went to go see Elias the night he died,
then turned up at the flat the next day.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.040
He must know something.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.760
All right, leave it with me.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.480
Rask, come quick!

24:08.360 --> 24:09.840
-What happened?
-Come.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.880
I lost Sören. Him and Elias
must have split up. Look at this.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.880
Katja. Okay, who's she talking to?

24:18.560 --> 24:19.880
That guy

24:20.760 --> 24:23.280
is the same guy who comes walking here.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.160
That's the fraud car.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.000
Katja is talking to the killer.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.120
I'll get Modin
to track her phone. Call Katja.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.920
I'm gonna go and get
a court order for the trace. Go, Kurt!

24:42.440 --> 24:46.840
Katja, this is Kurt Wallander, again.
Please, I really need to talk to you.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.600
Please call me back.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.520
Let's go.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.520
Modin's tracking Katja's phone.
Call her to get directions.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.440
<i>-Modin.</i>
-This is Wallander. We need the trace now.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.040
<i>Just gaining access.</i>

25:11.600 --> 25:12.760
I'm nearly there.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.960
Katja, come on. Katja, come on.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.760
<i>She's not at the university. Drive south.</i>

25:18.840 --> 25:21.280
-She lied to me. I didn't see it.
-That's what people do.

25:21.360 --> 25:24.320
That's why you should've brought her in
and taken a proper statement.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.560
This could go really wrong, Kurt.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.680
Yes!

25:34.760 --> 25:35.680
<i>I've got it.</i>

25:35.760 --> 25:39.760
<i>She's at Lindängen. Exact location</i>
<i>should be on your car console now</i>.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.560
There's no one here.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.560
Sure this is right location?

25:56.640 --> 25:57.920
<i>It's right there!</i>

25:59.560 --> 26:02.600
Of course, she's dumped it.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.880
Let's head for the university
and let's hope she's there.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.920
I'll call Rez
and tell him to meet us there.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.680
<i>Hi, Kurt. What's up?</i>

26:17.760 --> 26:21.440
<i>Rez, can you meet us at the university?</i>
<i>We need to bring in Katja.</i>

26:21.520 --> 26:24.040
Yeah, all right, no problem, mate.
Me and Fred are on our way.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.200
Perfect.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.400
Osei wants to see me at the station.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.240
It's probably a good idea
to bring him up to speed with Katja.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.280
Best if hears it from us first.

26:47.800 --> 26:48.680
Hey, listen.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.360
Just wait here.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.160
Katja, this is the police. Are you there?

27:10.880 --> 27:13.120
Look, we really need to talk to you.

27:15.640 --> 27:18.480
-Katja!
-Come on, Rez. She's not here.

27:42.520 --> 27:43.480
Come.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.320
Good. You're here.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.920
Detective Edman has
some questions for you.

27:50.440 --> 27:53.640
We need to talk to you
about your interrogation of Elias Fager.

27:55.560 --> 27:56.400
Sit down.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.200
Kurt Wallander.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.760
<i>It's me. It's Katja. I'm in trouble.</i>

28:29.360 --> 28:30.800
I'm sorry I lied. I was scared.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.560
-<i>Where are you now</i>?
-In my dorm room.

28:32.640 --> 28:33.520
Okay, stay calm.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.280
<i>Stay where you are. I'm on my way.</i>

28:35.360 --> 28:37.200
Okay. Please hurry.

28:48.080 --> 28:51.320
<i>Voicemail for Detective Inspector</i>
<i>Frida Rask. Leave a message.</i>

28:51.840 --> 28:54.800
I found Katja.
She's in her dorm room. She's in trouble.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.640
I'm heading there now.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.200
Police. Open the door.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.200
Open up, or we force entry!

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
-Kurt.
-<i>Rez. Katja's in trouble, okay?</i>

29:56.080 --> 29:57.800
<i>I need you to go to her dorm now.</i>

29:58.320 --> 30:00.120
We just came from there. She's not in.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.960
<i>No, she's in the flat!</i>
<i>Someone is trying to force entry</i>.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.680
Okay, will do.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.720
Freddie, let's go!

30:10.360 --> 30:11.400
Let's go, man.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.360
Forget the… Go.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.160
Fuck!

30:28.520 --> 30:30.800
We know what you did, Katja.
Open up!

31:57.160 --> 31:58.400
-Katja?
-<i>I left.</i>

31:59.400 --> 32:00.720
Where are you now?

32:00.800 --> 32:02.760
He was there at the door. I just had to--

32:02.840 --> 32:05.400
<i>Move out into roads.</i>
<i>Get among people, okay?</i>

32:06.320 --> 32:07.160
Okay.

32:08.920 --> 32:12.520
-There's a concert at Lund's Nation.
-See you there in a couple of minutes.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.800
<i>All right.</i>

32:17.640 --> 32:18.520
Okay.

32:19.760 --> 32:20.600
Excuse me.

32:22.760 --> 32:25.080
-Hey.
-This is fucking bullshit.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.000
-How long?
-As long as I decide.

32:27.080 --> 32:30.000
They're questioning my integrity.
You know I didn't do anything wrong!

32:30.080 --> 32:32.200
I just saw that interrogation.

32:33.160 --> 32:37.440
You pushed Elias, threatened his brother.
"Prison's too good for you."

32:37.520 --> 32:40.800
I've had a journalist blowing up my phone
all evening. He spoke with Moberg's widow.

32:40.880 --> 32:44.160
Apparently, you share her opinion
that justice has been done.

32:44.240 --> 32:47.920
-I didn't say that. That's not true--
-That's why you shouldn't have gone.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.040
Frida.

32:52.440 --> 32:55.160
Don't make this any more difficult
than it already is.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.680
You're off the case.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.440
-You're suspending me?
-I'm protecting you.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.320
From them.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.520
They're gonna throw me to the wolves.

33:08.640 --> 33:09.960
And you're gonna let them.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.880
You can tell your friends in there

33:12.960 --> 33:16.720
that I did what I could to try
and save what was left of that boy's life.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.760
-Yes?
-<i>Where are you now, close?</i>

33:53.840 --> 33:54.760
I'm in the old town.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.680
-<i>Okay.</i>
-I'll be there soon.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.600
<i>Good.</i>

34:07.000 --> 34:08.040
Rez.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.360
We're five minutes away.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.960
<i>She's heading to Lund's Nation.</i>
<i>See you there.</i>

34:12.040 --> 34:12.920
All right.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.440
Fucking hell.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.480
-Kurt!
She's not here.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.480
-Go check inside.
-All right.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.120
Katja! Katja!

36:27.560 --> 36:29.280
No! No, no, no!

36:31.720 --> 36:32.880
No!

36:34.240 --> 36:35.120
No!

36:44.440 --> 36:47.280
