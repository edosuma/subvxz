00:02.952 --> 00:04.529
<i>I read that the male seahorse</i>

00:04.530 --> 00:06.500
<i>actually gets pregnant
and gives birth.</i>

00:07.081 --> 00:08.447
<i>Just think about that.</i>

00:09.302 --> 00:10.654
<i>One day, he's out in a coral reef</i>

00:10.655 --> 00:13.022
<i>lookin' for some curly
tail, thinking he's a man.</i>

00:13.662 --> 00:14.673
<i>Next thing you know,</i>

00:14.674 --> 00:16.842
<i>his boys are all talking
about, "Let's go out!"</i>

00:17.015 --> 00:19.873
<i>He's like, "Nah, I got
knocked up, my dude,</i>

00:19.874 --> 00:21.697
<i>but you could you
bring me some algae?"</i>

00:23.084 --> 00:24.977
<i>No, I respect the little sea horse</i>

00:25.012 --> 00:27.893
<i>for being a great dad,
but at the same time,</i>

00:27.894 --> 00:30.750
<i>he's a punk for making
us all look bad.</i>

00:37.103 --> 00:38.438
Um, Tray?

00:38.807 --> 00:40.406
Do we need to have another convo

00:40.442 --> 00:41.923
about you being on your phone at work?

00:41.924 --> 00:43.274
I was just seeing what time it is.

00:43.275 --> 00:44.808
Oh, okay. I'll tell you what time it is.

00:44.844 --> 00:47.478
It's work time, and employees on cellphones

00:47.513 --> 00:50.300
is against Grundle's
policy, as you well know.

00:50.698 --> 00:52.017
Okay, let me just... Let me...

00:52.018 --> 00:53.578
Okay, phone away. Please and thank you.

00:54.242 --> 00:55.304
Thanks.

00:57.857 --> 01:00.024
♪<i> Baby, I'm not feeling...</i> ♪

01:00.059 --> 01:01.059
Go ahead.

01:01.486 --> 01:02.694
Give me a reason.

01:03.138 --> 01:04.425
You the boss.

01:07.857 --> 01:09.724
Yeah, hi, I'm in
a little bit of a rush.

01:09.786 --> 01:11.652
Can I get a half-caff, no foam,

01:11.688 --> 01:14.555
mocha latte with sugar and
an extra shot of espresso,

01:14.590 --> 01:16.050
please, but split into two cups?

01:16.505 --> 01:17.876
Aah!

Them kids look just like me, man.

01:29.609 --> 01:30.654
No question.

01:30.679 --> 01:32.567
You know, she can't keep
you from seeing the kids.

01:32.568 --> 01:33.586
That ain't right.

01:34.245 --> 01:36.877
I lost custody of my kids
last time I got arrested.

01:37.048 --> 01:38.413
What'd you get arrested for?

01:38.616 --> 01:39.849
Beating my kids.

01:40.051 --> 01:43.679
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:44.172 --> 01:46.188
Hey, what y'all in here talkin' about?

01:46.384 --> 01:48.517
All the ways you fucked up your lives?

01:48.552 --> 01:50.519
Sounded like a long conversation.

01:50.554 --> 01:52.154
Tray just found out he got kids,

01:52.189 --> 01:53.659
but his ex won't let him see them.

01:53.891 --> 01:55.123
Oh, Lord.

01:56.451 --> 01:59.194
Another generation of fatherless children

01:59.230 --> 02:01.038
being turned loose on the world.

02:01.039 --> 02:02.238
The cycle continues.

02:02.275 --> 02:04.041
I'm trying to be a part of their life,

02:04.077 --> 02:05.796
but unfortunately, it's not up to me.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.764
Yeah. I bet your pops
said the same thing, huh?

02:09.020 --> 02:10.621
That's why you a ex-convict

02:10.656 --> 02:12.265
sitting in a halfway house right now.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.820
Yo, that cycle shit is real.

02:13.821 --> 02:15.754
I can track when my life went
from run-of-the-mill fucked up

02:15.791 --> 02:18.916
to truly fucked up when my old man left.

02:18.917 --> 02:21.339
My pops took a job as
a department-store Santa

02:21.377 --> 02:23.421
just 'cause he didn't wanna
spend Christmas with us.

02:23.422 --> 02:25.604
Yep, yep. My pops was incarcerated, too,

02:25.677 --> 02:27.091
and it was all downhill from there.

02:27.116 --> 02:29.506
That's why I'm all, "Yo,
fuck absent fathers, B."

02:29.531 --> 02:30.694
Wait a minute.

02:30.695 --> 02:32.361
Y'all really think that
y'all ended up in jail

02:32.395 --> 02:33.661
'cause you didn't have a pops?

02:33.697 --> 02:35.196
Nah, I ended up in jail 'cause my lawyer

02:35.232 --> 02:37.031
was a bag of shit. He didn't object.

02:37.067 --> 02:38.766
Anybody that watches "Law & Order" knows

02:38.802 --> 02:40.001
you supposed to object.

02:40.036 --> 02:41.402
This nigga didn't object not one time!

02:41.438 --> 02:42.604
This is good, guys.

02:42.639 --> 02:44.305
We are making progress here.

02:44.341 --> 02:46.748
See, y'all are recognizing
that you ain't shit

02:46.910 --> 02:48.892
and that you ain't gonna be shit.

02:49.017 --> 02:51.743
That's why you're doomed
to a life of failure, man.

02:51.744 --> 02:54.190
Without that father-son relationship,

02:54.480 --> 02:56.597
you're always tryin' to feel love,

02:56.598 --> 02:59.857
that father-size hole left
in your convict hearts.

03:00.035 --> 03:02.369
Okay. Come on, let's
loosen it up a little bit.

03:02.404 --> 03:04.704
Let's lighten up. How
about a little prop comedy?

03:04.740 --> 03:07.207
Anybody got some, uh,
prop for me I can use?

03:07.242 --> 03:09.776
Any prop I can... Uh,
Barker, where you going?

03:09.811 --> 03:11.411
You gonna miss this prop comedy?

03:11.446 --> 03:13.146
Don't leave! I'll tell...

03:13.181 --> 03:15.317
You gonna be on bathroom
duty the rest of the week!

03:29.766 --> 03:31.886
Come and get some of
these ice creams out of my hands.

03:32.061 --> 03:33.879
This shit is drippin' all over the place.

03:33.904 --> 03:35.259
What are you doing here, Tray?

03:35.260 --> 03:37.093
Don't take this strawberry.
That's my flavor.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.662
Take the chocolate moose tracks.

03:38.697 --> 03:40.163
- Moose tracks?
- Moose tracks.

03:40.198 --> 03:42.265
You know you like a little chocolate swirl

03:42.301 --> 03:43.900
in your vanilla, Josh.

03:43.936 --> 03:46.369
Oh, that's funny.
That's... That's very funny.

03:46.405 --> 03:48.711
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, listen, Tray. You need to leave.

03:48.803 --> 03:50.118
You know you can't be here.

03:50.119 --> 03:52.409
I'm just bringin' the kids
some ice-cream cones, man.

03:52.434 --> 03:53.833
Is that so wrong?

03:53.868 --> 03:56.423
You really wanna keep
ice cream from the kids?

03:56.824 --> 03:58.421
What kind of man are you, Josh?

03:58.422 --> 04:00.989
No, I'm trying to keep <i> the
kids</i> away from <i> you,</i>

04:01.236 --> 04:03.136
and they're not even here anyway.

04:03.172 --> 04:05.172
It's the middle of the school day, so...

04:06.557 --> 04:07.996
Me and you bumped heads,

04:08.253 --> 04:09.737
but if you stay in your lane,

04:09.738 --> 04:11.363
we gonna be all right.

04:11.841 --> 04:12.952
Stay in my lane?

04:13.123 --> 04:15.290
This <i> is</i> my lane.
This is my <i> house!</i>

04:16.982 --> 04:18.622
- How long you lived here?
- You didn't...

04:18.935 --> 04:20.494
- Nine years.
- Mm-hmm?

04:20.529 --> 04:21.829
- Nine?
- Nine.

04:21.863 --> 04:23.798
- Rented or homeowner?
- Homeowner.

04:23.833 --> 04:24.871
Mm-hmm.

04:25.159 --> 04:26.792
Good neighborhood, right?

04:26.828 --> 04:28.294
Uh, yeah. It's the best.

04:28.329 --> 04:30.668
Yeah, you know this neighborhood
used to be fucked up?

04:30.801 --> 04:32.698
- Thank you.
- Good... Good public school?

04:32.734 --> 04:34.186
No. Actually, no.

04:34.211 --> 04:35.443
But it doesn't matter

04:35.479 --> 04:37.159
'cause we send the kids to private school.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.620
- Private school...
- Yeah.

04:38.956 --> 04:40.535
I hope it's a <i> good</i> private school.

04:40.536 --> 04:41.902
Yeah, the Rothman School...

04:41.937 --> 04:43.236
It's the best school in Brooklyn.

04:43.272 --> 04:44.503
- Right, right.
- It's very diverse.

04:44.504 --> 04:46.472
It's got a good science
program, which is important.

04:46.497 --> 04:48.072
Right. Hold on to this one.

04:48.598 --> 04:50.280
Dig on that. Dig on it.

04:50.305 --> 04:51.604
- Yeah. I will.
- Okay.

04:51.629 --> 04:54.766
I wanna... I wanna thank you.

04:54.840 --> 04:55.945
- Okay.
- Okay?

04:55.946 --> 04:57.112
- Yeah.
- My man.

04:57.426 --> 04:58.488
Great.

05:01.691 --> 05:02.707
Oh, no.

05:02.743 --> 05:03.812
No, Tray!

05:04.278 --> 05:05.431
No, no, no!

05:05.660 --> 05:07.135
Tray, come back here!

05:08.048 --> 05:09.071
Tray!

05:12.459 --> 05:14.964
Dr. Caruso is so stupid.

05:15.173 --> 05:16.458
Doesn't she have a PhD

05:16.459 --> 05:19.168
in, like, astrophysics or something?

05:19.663 --> 05:21.565
Yeah, and she's stupid.

05:24.310 --> 05:25.543
Um...

05:26.839 --> 05:28.026
Is that...?

05:30.674 --> 05:33.082
Oh... my God.

05:34.287 --> 05:35.543
What do we do?

05:37.300 --> 05:38.492
What do you think?

05:43.404 --> 05:45.240
Hi, kids. I-I'm Tray Barker,

05:45.241 --> 05:47.087
and this is my associate, Cousin Bobby,

05:47.180 --> 05:48.579
and I'm a friend of your mom's.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.172
And she told me to come walk you home.

05:50.173 --> 05:51.446
Wait, no, no, no.

05:51.501 --> 05:52.967
You're the guy from the art gallery.

05:53.003 --> 05:54.903
Yeah, she told us to stay away from you.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.471
You know why your moms told you that?

05:57.081 --> 05:58.473
Because you're our biological father.

05:58.508 --> 06:00.691
- You knew that already?
- It's obvious.

06:00.929 --> 06:02.353
She wouldn't let us talk to you.

06:02.354 --> 06:04.488
She wouldn't let us ask
any questions about you.

06:04.945 --> 06:06.866
And you look just like Shahzad.

06:07.144 --> 06:08.191
What?!

06:08.227 --> 06:09.440
I don't look like that.

06:09.441 --> 06:12.066
Nah, so, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.511
Yeah, same nose...

06:14.547 --> 06:16.947
Yeah, you lookin' at your future, son.

06:17.913 --> 06:18.984
It's pretty bleak.

06:19.018 --> 06:20.384
Listen, your mom
has created a boundary

06:20.419 --> 06:22.589
that I'm gonna be very respectful of.

06:22.614 --> 06:26.523
I'm gonna interpret that as
like a two-foot safety area.

06:26.559 --> 06:27.858
What makes you think

06:27.893 --> 06:29.653
you can just have a
relationship with us now?

06:30.653 --> 06:32.668
Just walk with me. Give me a chance.

06:33.412 --> 06:34.730
If we go with you,

06:34.784 --> 06:36.400
then you have to answer
every question we have.

06:36.401 --> 06:37.600
But... Mom said...

06:37.636 --> 06:39.636
Stop being such a bitch, Shahzad.

06:39.671 --> 06:41.901
Yo! She's got you, son.

06:41.926 --> 06:43.573
- Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.
- Like stop...

06:43.608 --> 06:44.726
Bobby. Not now.

06:45.141 --> 06:46.476
I'll answer what I can.

06:46.747 --> 06:48.243
Answer everything or no deal.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.409
Ooh, little mama's a boss, son.

06:50.434 --> 06:52.591
- Of course. That's my daughter.
- Yeah, word.

06:52.592 --> 06:53.958
No. No, no, no, no. Unh-unh.

06:53.994 --> 06:56.160
None of that "daughter"
shit. You need to earn that.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.061
Listen, I want... I wanna earn it.

06:59.062 --> 07:01.942
Let me... Let me take you
kids on a truth safari.

07:03.142 --> 07:04.675
Are we going, son?

07:04.995 --> 07:06.160
We going?

07:07.104 --> 07:09.300
Oh, shit, son. We going?!

07:09.325 --> 07:11.387
We going on a truth safari, son?!

07:11.439 --> 07:13.754
Yo. Pull up the skirt. Come on, son.

07:14.109 --> 07:15.789
Come... Come on, baby.

07:15.814 --> 07:17.047
This is what it's about.

07:17.082 --> 07:18.616
We going back to the Mecca. Come on!

07:18.617 --> 07:20.342
This is a bad idea.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.319
"So, when you think of Myanmar,"

07:25.416 --> 07:28.140
don't think of hateful,
hard-line Buddhists

07:28.194 --> 07:30.395
or the fourth 'Rambo' movie.

07:30.624 --> 07:33.191
"Think of delectable deep-dish pizza."

07:33.227 --> 07:35.327
Jesus Christ, no, Josh.

07:35.944 --> 07:37.095
No.

07:39.748 --> 07:41.614
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

07:41.866 --> 07:42.923
How was your day?

07:42.924 --> 07:44.002
It was good.

07:44.541 --> 07:46.508
It was... normal.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.243
The same.

07:49.985 --> 07:51.342
Tray came by today.

07:51.343 --> 07:52.548
How was your day?

07:54.093 --> 07:55.406
Are you serious?

07:56.328 --> 07:57.754
He came to the house?

07:58.151 --> 07:59.317
Yeah, I was...

07:59.352 --> 08:01.321
I saw him when I was
coming in from my bike ride.

08:01.986 --> 08:03.022
And?

08:03.047 --> 08:04.440
He... That's it.

08:04.717 --> 08:05.898
Quick exchange.

08:05.923 --> 08:07.752
Uh... he took off.

08:08.035 --> 08:09.475
So you spoke to him?

08:09.985 --> 08:11.723
Well, yeah. Yeah.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.121
Yeah, I mean, it was...

08:13.122 --> 08:15.795
It was definitely more cordial
than the last time I saw him.

08:15.820 --> 08:18.654
He's... He's actually got a
pretty decent energy to him.

08:18.689 --> 08:20.125
And what did you talk about?

08:20.708 --> 08:21.957
I don't... Uh...

08:22.589 --> 08:23.666
He was, like...

08:23.667 --> 08:25.151
He... He was asking
about the kids and stuff.

08:25.152 --> 08:26.485
He asked about the kids?

08:27.267 --> 08:28.354
And what did you tell him?

08:28.355 --> 08:30.489
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

08:30.524 --> 08:32.909
He was like, "Where... Are the kids home?"

08:33.000 --> 08:35.155
I said, "Obviously not. They're at school."

08:35.157 --> 08:36.477
You told him they were at school?

08:36.503 --> 08:38.039
No, I... No.

08:38.065 --> 08:40.712
I said, "They're not here right now.

08:41.101 --> 08:42.791
They're at school. Sorry."

08:42.792 --> 08:45.259
Josh, tell me you didn't tell him

08:45.295 --> 08:46.844
what school they go to.

08:47.163 --> 08:49.207
He asked, and I wasn't thinking and it...

08:49.238 --> 08:50.621
Damn it, Josh!

08:50.700 --> 08:52.133
But... Where are you going?

08:52.169 --> 08:53.802
I'm tracking Amira's phone.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.002
They're with him. I know it.

08:55.003 --> 08:56.979
What? Let's not jump to conclusions.

08:56.980 --> 08:59.172
It... He doesn't ha...

09:00.980 --> 09:02.444
Shit. Wait up!

09:07.589 --> 09:09.286
This is where it all started.

09:09.718 --> 09:11.681
Isn't Jay-Z from around here?

09:11.682 --> 09:13.053
And Barbra Streisand.

09:13.054 --> 09:14.980
She from Flatbush, dumb-ass.

09:15.350 --> 09:17.284
Me and your moms is from here.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.186
So, how'd you meet?

09:19.646 --> 09:21.479
Fight broke out right here

09:21.514 --> 09:23.553
between this fat dude and a skinny dude.

09:23.554 --> 09:26.303
I mean, this fat dude was
wearin' the skinny dude out!

09:26.957 --> 09:28.924
And me and your mom was
right there watchin' it.

09:29.254 --> 09:32.042
It was hilarious, and
that's when it happened.

09:40.685 --> 09:42.183
That's when you talked to Mom?

09:42.690 --> 09:43.680
Nah.

09:43.681 --> 09:46.180
That's when Crazy Mike broke
up a fight holdin' a baby.

09:46.216 --> 09:48.210
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:48.366 --> 09:49.699
It was legendary.

09:49.734 --> 09:51.667
It had never been done before.

09:51.703 --> 09:54.583
No one ever broke up
a fight holdin' a baby.

10:01.764 --> 10:03.720
He is to never be forgotten, okay?

10:04.027 --> 10:06.527
Never. Happened right there.

10:06.563 --> 10:07.528
Word.

10:07.564 --> 10:09.648
- Mike, Mike!
- Mike, baby!

10:09.673 --> 10:11.173
You will never be forgotten.

10:11.208 --> 10:12.374
Ever, baby!

10:12.410 --> 10:14.522
The next day, I saw
her sittin' right there.

10:14.849 --> 10:15.899
I was like,

10:15.939 --> 10:18.873
"How about Crazy Mike breakin'
up that fight holdin' a baby?"

10:21.099 --> 10:22.734
We was cool after that.

10:30.232 --> 10:32.065
I've called Amira five times,

10:32.101 --> 10:33.461
and she's not answering the phone.

10:34.955 --> 10:36.752
No, no, no, no, no!

10:36.753 --> 10:38.353
She just disappeared off the map!

10:38.388 --> 10:40.400
No, she probably turned off her phone.

10:40.401 --> 10:41.567
Okay?

10:41.603 --> 10:42.771
They're fine. I'm sure they're fine.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.202
I don't want it to be fine.

10:44.316 --> 10:46.349
I want to take a nutcracker...

10:46.384 --> 10:48.351
- Okay.
- To their felon-ass,

10:48.386 --> 10:51.421
crack-dealin' biological father's dick!

10:51.456 --> 10:52.722
- Whoa!
- Damn!

10:52.757 --> 10:56.426
Okay, you wanna take a
nutcracker to his dick?

10:56.756 --> 10:59.390
- The...
- Don't try to analyze my rage right now.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.743
Okay, well, don't take
it out on me. Thank you.

11:01.768 --> 11:04.468
But you're the one who told
him what school they go to.

11:04.504 --> 11:06.470
That is not... That's a true statement.

11:06.471 --> 11:08.727
Yes. But what about you?

11:09.347 --> 11:11.449
You made babies with Stringer Bell!

11:11.485 --> 11:13.351
- Oh...
- Excuse me?

11:13.699 --> 11:16.399
We'd love it if we could
have some privacy, please.

11:16.435 --> 11:18.101
I-I wasn't listening to you.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.569
Yes, you was. Guess what...

11:19.604 --> 11:21.268
Don't fuck around and
get a one-star rating.

11:21.269 --> 11:22.452
Oh, word?

11:22.453 --> 11:24.503
I'll go back and give <i>
you</i> a one-star rating!

11:24.539 --> 11:25.805
No... Did you just hear this shit?

11:25.840 --> 11:27.439
Hey, no, no, no, no,
no. No, no, no, hey, hey.

11:27.475 --> 11:28.741
- Did you just hear this shit?
- Hey!

11:28.776 --> 11:31.210
Nobody has to give out
any one-star ratings

11:31.245 --> 11:33.546
or anything like that. Let's
all take a breath, okay?

11:33.581 --> 11:36.120
- Take it down notch.
- You're right. You're right.

11:36.145 --> 11:38.252
I'm sorry, Mr. Lyft driver.

11:38.686 --> 11:41.147
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

11:41.455 --> 11:42.619
Five stars?

11:46.694 --> 11:47.867
I have a question.

11:47.989 --> 11:50.055
If you and Mom had such
a good relationship,

11:50.389 --> 11:52.082
how come she wants nothing to do with you?

11:52.083 --> 11:53.823
'Cause she's mad
'cause I went to prison.

11:53.824 --> 11:55.791
Oh, man. What'd you do?

11:56.261 --> 11:58.661
I was busted for selling crack cocaine.

11:58.697 --> 12:01.097
Were you, like, on drugs then?

12:01.307 --> 12:02.369
Wasn't on drugs.

12:02.370 --> 12:03.836
I would <i> sell</i> drugs.

12:04.373 --> 12:06.608
Wait, wait. Did Mom sell crack, too?

12:07.176 --> 12:09.309
- Nope, never.
- Well, she at least

12:09.345 --> 12:10.519
weighed it and bagged it, right?

12:10.520 --> 12:13.410
Bobby! No, she never did that.

12:13.491 --> 12:14.675
Wait, wait, wait.

12:14.731 --> 12:16.358
Okay, what did Mom do?

12:16.393 --> 12:18.660
Okay, every now and then,
she would, like, draw hearts

12:18.695 --> 12:21.663
and unicorns on the shit
on the baggies, you know,

12:21.773 --> 12:24.132
just to make it look nice, but that's it.

12:24.157 --> 12:25.745
She never did nothing else.

12:26.352 --> 12:27.818
So, she knew?

12:27.994 --> 12:29.527
I mean, it's not like

12:29.562 --> 12:32.002
she's completely free of blame or anything.

12:32.003 --> 12:33.115
Eh...

12:33.700 --> 12:35.373
Let me tell you something, Amira...

12:35.871 --> 12:37.509
Life was different then.

12:37.971 --> 12:39.838
I mean, we didn't have any opportunities.

12:39.873 --> 12:41.361
We had to create our own.

12:41.508 --> 12:44.276
So, you guys had, like,
a legit relationship.

12:44.586 --> 12:45.610
Of course.

12:45.646 --> 12:48.586
Me and your mother had a
proper Brooklyn love story.

12:49.834 --> 12:51.420
I remember one time...

12:51.962 --> 12:53.101
I remember one time

12:53.102 --> 12:55.769
she threw a brick through
a cop-car windshield.

12:55.924 --> 12:57.328
She threw a brick?!

12:57.550 --> 12:59.616
Threw a brick through the windshield, yeah.

13:00.003 --> 13:01.851
- Why?
- 'Cause she loved me.

13:02.554 --> 13:03.753
One time, she said,

13:03.788 --> 13:05.275
"I'll do anything for you, Tray."

13:05.367 --> 13:06.933
I said, "You won't throw no brick

13:06.968 --> 13:08.501
through no cop-car windshield."

13:08.537 --> 13:09.803
And she threw the brick,

13:09.838 --> 13:11.805
and I said, "Shay, you fucking crazy!"

13:12.409 --> 13:14.042
And then she turned around and said,

13:14.043 --> 13:15.810
"fuck the police, Tray!"

13:16.184 --> 13:17.359
Your moms.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.826
Yeah, yeah.

13:19.106 --> 13:21.700
Wow, so she really loved you.

13:21.964 --> 13:23.164
Yes, she did. She really...

13:23.199 --> 13:24.640
I wish my parents loved each other.

13:25.490 --> 13:27.739
My father left to get a Ja
Rule CD and never came back.

13:27.740 --> 13:28.825
Bobby!

13:29.180 --> 13:31.161
Let me bond with the
kids. Please step back.

13:31.193 --> 13:33.448
- F-For real?
- Just step back. Please.

13:34.055 --> 13:35.231
I'ma fall back.

13:35.389 --> 13:36.753
I'm fallin' back, son.

13:39.811 --> 13:41.559
I think it's time for me to take y'all back

13:41.596 --> 13:42.886
to where y'all come from.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.009
Let's roll. Come on.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.800
Come on.

13:48.584 --> 13:49.602
Let's go.

13:51.020 --> 13:52.153
Can I go?

13:52.222 --> 13:53.294
Bobby, come on.

13:53.325 --> 13:54.334
All right!

13:54.359 --> 13:55.383
Let's roll.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.848
Like we a family! You know what I'm sayin'?

13:59.278 --> 14:00.678
Me and Tray, we like brothers.

14:00.713 --> 14:01.679
You like...

14:01.680 --> 14:03.305
- you know what I'm sayin'?
- Nah.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.292
This is where the trail went cold.

14:15.839 --> 14:17.454
What are you doing, Tray?

14:19.698 --> 14:21.698
I never realized you lived so close.

14:22.155 --> 14:24.454
I mean, this place isn't that bad.

14:24.712 --> 14:26.450
There's like two
Starbucks right down there.

14:26.482 --> 14:28.435
You made it sound like it
was the ghetto or something.

14:28.460 --> 14:29.993
I never said it was the ghetto.

14:30.029 --> 14:31.029
That's your words.

14:31.408 --> 14:32.574
I think you did.

14:32.575 --> 14:34.471
This place... wasn't that bad.

14:34.496 --> 14:36.151
Just a little rough around the edges.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.480
Actually, it brings back a lot of memories.

14:48.771 --> 14:49.713
Hey.

14:49.738 --> 14:52.071
Get the fuck back before
I knock your ass out, bitch!

14:52.107 --> 14:53.373
Just askin' if you had a moment

14:53.408 --> 14:54.907
to save the polar ice caps.

14:54.943 --> 14:56.876
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

14:56.911 --> 14:58.990
I am so sorry.

14:59.597 --> 15:01.881
You shouldn't roll up
on people like that here.

15:02.124 --> 15:03.148
There you go.

15:03.663 --> 15:05.033
Peace be with you.

15:06.355 --> 15:08.522
Amira! Shahzad!

15:08.787 --> 15:10.171
Don't even try it.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.089
They with Tray

15:12.340 --> 15:14.776
on some fucked up trip down memory lane.

15:15.526 --> 15:17.587
What, you think they're
gonna be scared of him?

15:17.588 --> 15:18.681
Worse.

15:21.479 --> 15:23.311
I think they're gonna like him.

15:27.372 --> 15:29.153
Over there is where my
grandmother's buried.

15:29.154 --> 15:30.361
Her name was Nan.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.174
Up there is where my
Uncle Marvin was buried.

15:33.213 --> 15:34.846
He gave me my first sip of beer.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.873
Yeah, my brother Clyde,
about a hundred feet that way.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.785
And he got popped in '03.

15:40.580 --> 15:42.222
Left me to fend for myself.

15:43.450 --> 15:45.354
Yeah, about the same age as you.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.293
So...

15:48.689 --> 15:50.422
you... you brought us here to show us

15:50.457 --> 15:52.021
a bunch of dead people's graves.

15:52.245 --> 15:53.413
Hell, no.

15:53.414 --> 15:55.574
I brought you here to show
you where you was conceived.

15:55.803 --> 15:57.481
You see that big-ass tree right there

15:57.482 --> 15:59.006
with the low-hanging branches?

15:59.351 --> 16:01.141
That's where me and your mother made you.

16:02.643 --> 16:04.095
That's where the magic happened

16:04.096 --> 16:05.142
with me and your mother.

16:05.143 --> 16:07.188
That's where she pulled
the rabbit out of the hat.

16:07.838 --> 16:08.959
Voila.

16:09.340 --> 16:12.302
I can't believe y'all
had sex in a cemetery.

16:12.436 --> 16:13.869
I'ma tell you something, Amira.

16:13.904 --> 16:16.300
The cemetery is like the ghetto itself...

16:16.519 --> 16:18.362
Full of sadness and death,

16:18.581 --> 16:20.451
but it's also full of life.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.117
Uh, I feel nauseous.

16:23.152 --> 16:25.085
Zad! Amira!

16:25.121 --> 16:26.320
I got this. Wait a minute.

16:26.355 --> 16:27.721
Hey! You ain't gonna be running up...

16:27.756 --> 16:29.423
Shay!

16:29.458 --> 16:31.125
Tray, you next! I'm about
to light your ass up!

16:31.160 --> 16:32.626
- Shay, Shay!
- Mom, Mom, it's fine!

16:32.661 --> 16:34.895
He was just showing us some
stuff from back in the day.

16:34.930 --> 16:36.069
You were wild.

16:36.070 --> 16:37.898
I can't believe the stuff
you used to do outside.

16:37.933 --> 16:39.433
You had no right to do this!

16:39.468 --> 16:41.034
These are my kids, too, Shay!

16:41.070 --> 16:42.669
I'm trying to make up for lost time!

16:42.705 --> 16:45.487
You are not welcome to
barge into our lives!

16:45.574 --> 16:46.799
Not after what you did!

16:46.800 --> 16:48.901
What did I do? I made mistakes.

16:48.936 --> 16:51.629
I paid for my mistakes. I did my time.

16:51.714 --> 16:53.260
That should mean something.

16:53.507 --> 16:54.806
Those were your choices.

16:54.842 --> 16:56.775
You chose not to rat on Wavy,

16:56.810 --> 16:59.661
and you missed out on your
kids' lives because of it.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.452
I didn't even know I <i> had</i> kids!

17:01.487 --> 17:02.753
You never told me!

17:02.788 --> 17:04.506
<i>You</i> never told <i> me!</i>

17:04.507 --> 17:06.566
Tray. You done crossed the line.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.464
This is the last straw for me.

17:09.548 --> 17:11.182
- Look, Mom, he was...
- You hush!

17:11.579 --> 17:14.248
If you ever pull one of
these shenanigans again,

17:14.282 --> 17:16.550
I swear to God, I will call the cops on you

17:16.585 --> 17:18.751
and have them drag you back to jail.

17:19.534 --> 17:21.588
Try me. See if I don't do it.

17:21.914 --> 17:23.250
You'll call the cops on me, Shay?

17:23.251 --> 17:25.646
Sure will. We done here.

17:26.925 --> 17:28.635
You hear me? Done.

17:29.074 --> 17:30.215
Come on.

17:31.087 --> 17:32.266
Come on!

17:34.323 --> 17:36.258
Don't come around us anymore.

17:45.297 --> 17:46.723
- Bobby.
- Hmm?

17:46.759 --> 17:49.026
- Come on.
- Uh, what happened?

17:49.219 --> 17:51.562
- Come on.
- What happened? I took a nap.

17:51.597 --> 17:52.807
I'm... I'm good.

17:52.832 --> 17:54.565
All we did... Was take a nap.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.254
- Yep. Who...
- Come on.

18:03.278 --> 18:04.697
It's you. It's you.

18:04.722 --> 18:06.476
That's not me! Are you kidding?

18:06.501 --> 18:07.667
That's me?

18:07.692 --> 18:09.910
I know I have a big head, but not that big.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.657
Okay, so a man with buttons.

18:11.693 --> 18:13.960
- It's not a man with a button.
- Okay, it's a man in a suit.

18:13.994 --> 18:15.494
What if I give you this?
No, not a man in a suit.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.429
Okay, that's a man who
has a really bad haircut.

18:18.866 --> 18:21.166
- No, that's not a man with a bad...
- He's wearing a beret.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.201
Look at it! It... Uh, it's a person!

18:23.237 --> 18:24.803
There's only one thing that it could be.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.035
It's a person!

18:26.036 --> 18:27.818
A human? A human being.

18:27.819 --> 18:29.719
- No. It's a gingerbread man.
- A gingerbread man?

18:29.755 --> 18:33.303
- It's a ginger...
- Oh! I don't even eat gingerbread.

18:33.330 --> 18:34.896
- You don't eat gingerbread?
- No.

18:34.932 --> 18:36.731
Well, that's sad. That's a sad, sad thing.

18:36.767 --> 18:37.933
Okay, who's next?

18:37.968 --> 18:39.401
Who's next? So sad.

18:39.436 --> 18:40.962
You don't eat gingerbread.

18:43.848 --> 18:45.237
Gingerbread!

18:45.262 --> 18:46.509
I-I'm sorry.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.366
Okay, and start!

18:49.827 --> 18:50.886
Box.

18:51.796 --> 18:53.028
Rectangle!

18:54.272 --> 18:56.266
Oh!

18:56.300 --> 18:57.599
- Brick!
- Yeah!

18:57.635 --> 18:59.435
Whoo!

18:59.470 --> 19:01.236
Wait, brick? That's
how you explain "brick,"

19:01.272 --> 19:03.439
by throwing it through
the windshield of a car?

19:03.474 --> 19:05.140
A cop car, yeah.

19:05.176 --> 19:07.342
A cop car? Oh, wow.

19:17.376 --> 19:18.402
Shannon?

19:19.485 --> 19:20.697
Fuck the police.

19:21.017 --> 19:23.041
- Come on. My turn. Let's go.
- All right.

19:23.077 --> 19:24.243
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.298
Let's get it back.

19:26.453 --> 19:27.819
- All right.
- We need a win.

19:27.855 --> 19:29.187
I can't believe you drew this.

19:29.223 --> 19:30.983
- You ready for this?
- You really drew this?

19:33.827 --> 19:35.294
Yeah.

19:35.329 --> 19:36.495
Yeah, go ahead.

19:36.530 --> 19:38.130
Clean that good, real good.

19:38.165 --> 19:40.273
Make sure you get all up under there.

19:40.998 --> 19:43.362
You know what? You got to remember...

19:43.387 --> 19:45.051
Barker, you brought this on yourself.

19:45.522 --> 19:47.510
You brought it on yourself!

19:47.842 --> 19:49.970
You your own worst enemy, man.

19:50.075 --> 19:51.245
You are!

19:51.656 --> 19:54.372
This is truly a metaphor for you life...

19:54.582 --> 19:56.763
You with your face down in the shitter.

19:58.012 --> 20:00.763
It'd be funny if it wasn't so goddamn sad!
