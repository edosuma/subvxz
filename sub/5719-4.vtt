Previously on "Heartland"...

00:04.734 --> 00:06.735
Ugh!
Ow! It really hurts!

00:06.770 --> 00:08.871
You're gonna be okay.

00:08.905 --> 00:11.473
Stephen's leaving today.

00:11.475 --> 00:13.208
He's going to live
with his dad until fall.

00:13.242 --> 00:14.810
How's school going?

00:14.844 --> 00:17.312
Mom said she's helping you
study for some kind of retest.

00:17.346 --> 00:20.248
I thought tutoring was supposed
to make math less confusing.

00:20.283 --> 00:22.317
How you doing, old boy?

00:22.351 --> 00:24.787
How's retirement treating ya?

00:24.821 --> 00:28.123
So why haven't you been riding?

00:28.157 --> 00:30.225
It's Paint, isn't it?

00:52.715 --> 00:55.348
Hi Remi. Shhhh...

00:55.382 --> 00:59.363
- She's home!!
- Oh, Katie.

00:59.553 --> 01:01.989
- Your teacher called.
- I know. She said.

01:02.023 --> 01:03.724
You're in trouble...

01:03.758 --> 01:06.159
Okay, Katie, can you
please go play in your room?

01:06.193 --> 01:07.928
I was going to tell you.

01:07.962 --> 01:09.796
Mrs. Haggis is worried. Okay?

01:09.831 --> 01:11.798
Your final math exam
is only two weeks away

01:11.833 --> 01:14.034
and you're still not doing well
on any of your term tests

01:14.068 --> 01:16.869
or your quizzes and
she doesn't want you to fail.

01:16.903 --> 01:18.403
But if you don't
pull your marks up,

01:18.438 --> 01:19.705
you're going to be
facing summer school.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.107
Summer school?
No! I can't. I've got...

01:21.141 --> 01:24.209
Extreme team. I know.
So, we need to make a plan.

01:24.244 --> 01:26.445
I hope that plan doesn't
involve you helping me study

01:26.479 --> 01:27.880
because we'll end up
killing each other.

01:27.914 --> 01:29.649
I know that didn't work out.

01:29.683 --> 01:31.416
Mrs. Haggis suggested a tutor.

01:31.451 --> 01:33.352
Another student
from your school.

01:33.386 --> 01:34.720
And apparently he's had
a lot of success

01:34.755 --> 01:36.255
with some of the other kids.

01:36.289 --> 01:38.890
He? It's a he? No! No way!

01:38.924 --> 01:40.892
Okay, if you want to avoid
summer school,

01:40.926 --> 01:44.029
this is something you're going
to have to be open to.

01:48.433 --> 01:50.869
Ty! Pull over! Pull over!

02:01.880 --> 02:05.515
Is there ever gonna be a yard sale
that you're not gonna want to stop at?

02:05.550 --> 02:08.818
This is what, the fourth,
fifth this week?

02:08.853 --> 02:11.055
We have a loft to furnish, okay?

02:11.089 --> 02:13.057
And look at all this stuff!

02:13.091 --> 02:14.858
It's mostly crap, Amy.

02:14.893 --> 02:16.259
Hey, that's the beauty of it, okay.

02:16.294 --> 02:18.628
You never know what
you're gonna find.

02:18.662 --> 02:20.197
We'll find mostly crap.
That's what we're gonna find.

02:48.391 --> 02:51.560
Paint? Paint!

02:51.595 --> 02:53.129
What's wrong?

02:53.163 --> 02:55.464
Easy.

02:57.099 --> 02:58.500
These are cool.

02:58.534 --> 03:01.302
I-We don't need dishes.
I already have dishes.

03:01.337 --> 03:04.739
What, Caleb's? No, those
are not leaving the trailer.

03:04.773 --> 03:07.408
Oh! I love this table.

03:07.443 --> 03:09.410
Ty, this is beautiful.

03:10.746 --> 03:12.580
Good boy.

03:12.615 --> 03:15.215
That's it! Come on, Paint!

03:15.250 --> 03:17.851
You can do it.

03:17.885 --> 03:21.688
Hey, someone was a rodeo fan,
that's for sure.

03:23.758 --> 03:25.659
Hey, look at this.

03:27.495 --> 03:28.828
Doesn't that look like Jack?

03:28.863 --> 03:31.998
Oh my gosh, it is!
Isn't that Paint?

03:32.033 --> 03:33.400
We should buy it.

03:33.434 --> 03:34.834
Absolutely. He's got
a birthday coming up.

03:34.869 --> 03:36.602
We should frame it for him.

03:36.637 --> 03:39.572
Great. It could remind him
of how young he used to be.

03:39.606 --> 03:43.042
Okay, so maybe it's
not the perfect birthday gift.

03:43.076 --> 03:45.511
But I still think he'd like it.

03:45.546 --> 03:48.548
Good. We'll get this
and then we'll go.

03:48.582 --> 03:52.585
And we will get the table.
And the dishes.

03:59.793 --> 04:02.294
Ty! Are you around?

04:02.328 --> 04:03.696
There is something wrong
with Paint.

04:03.730 --> 04:05.397
I need you to get here now!

04:56.080 --> 04:58.815
- Grandpa!
- Hurry!

05:05.689 --> 05:08.235
Hey, Paint. Hey, buddy.

05:08.255 --> 05:10.193
Oh boy...

05:10.228 --> 05:12.095
I don't know how long
he's been trying to stand up.

05:12.130 --> 05:14.463
But he doesn't have
much strength left.

05:14.497 --> 05:16.531
We've got to get him
on his feet somehow.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.634
It's okay. We're here
to help you. All right?

05:18.668 --> 05:21.536
Just stay calm.

05:25.341 --> 05:27.843
- Okay. Jack, get a good grip.
- Yeah.

05:27.878 --> 05:31.113
On the count of three.
One... Two...

05:31.148 --> 05:32.614
Three.

05:32.649 --> 05:33.948
- That's it.
- Come on!

05:33.983 --> 05:37.319
That's it! Come on, Paint!

05:40.122 --> 05:43.858
- C'mon Paint!
- Up Paint! You can do it! Up!

05:43.893 --> 05:46.861
- Up, boy!
- He's trying. He's trying.

05:46.896 --> 05:48.397
C'mon boy.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.198
- There we go!
- That's it! Good boy.

05:50.232 --> 05:53.702
There he is! That a boy!

05:53.736 --> 05:55.136
There you go.

05:55.171 --> 05:58.907
Oh, you're my pal, aren't you?

05:58.941 --> 06:02.543
Okay. We'll give him
some time to rest.

06:02.577 --> 06:04.512
But then I'm gonna take him
down to the barn

06:04.546 --> 06:07.148
- and have a look at him.
- No.

06:07.183 --> 06:10.326
- What?
- That's not a good idea.

06:10.346 --> 06:11.026
Why?

06:11.046 --> 06:13.287
If he's in a stall
and he goes down again,

06:13.321 --> 06:17.390
it'll be a far worse scenario than
the one we just went through.

06:17.425 --> 06:20.430
- I hear you, Jack...
- He's better off in the field.

06:21.196 --> 06:23.931
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm sure.

06:23.965 --> 06:26.104
I'll catch up with you.

06:32.472 --> 06:34.106
There you go.

06:40.380 --> 06:42.766
- Hi.
- Hello.

06:44.242 --> 06:45.525
You all right?

06:45.545 --> 06:48.271
Nothing wrong with me.

06:48.717 --> 06:50.122
What happened?

06:50.157 --> 06:52.991
- It's Paint...
- What about Paint?

06:53.025 --> 06:55.626
What's wrong with him?

06:58.038 --> 07:01.466
Until when? Yeah.

07:01.736 --> 07:04.669
No, no. I totally understand.
Um, yeah, Scott.

07:04.703 --> 07:06.437
Family is important.

07:06.928 --> 07:10.837
Um, is there any chance
you could come by right now?

07:14.212 --> 07:16.647
No? Okay.

07:18.316 --> 07:19.717
Absolutely.

07:19.752 --> 07:22.618
Uh, well, best of luck
with everything.

07:23.389 --> 07:26.390
- Thanks.
- Scott's away?

07:26.759 --> 07:29.894
Yeah. For four days.

07:33.033 --> 07:35.231
You'll be fine.

07:35.515 --> 07:40.091
Yeah, I know I will. But it's
just, um, it's Jack's horse.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.439
And he really loves
that animal. So...

07:42.473 --> 07:46.510
I just want to make sure that
I give him the right advice if-

07:48.289 --> 07:49.613
You know...

07:49.943 --> 07:51.655
And you will.

07:52.116 --> 07:54.149
I heard the temperature's
going way down tonight.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.073
- Did you hear that?
- Mm-hmm.

07:56.093 --> 07:58.170
Are you guys going to be warm
enough in your trailer?

07:58.190 --> 08:00.723
Oh, yeah. As long as the
heater doesn't break down again,

08:00.757 --> 08:02.391
like it did last week,
we'll be fine.

08:02.426 --> 08:04.593
Well, you know, you're always
welcome to stay here anytime.

08:04.949 --> 08:06.488
Thank you.

08:06.930 --> 08:08.363
Grandpa, maybe...

08:08.398 --> 08:10.299
Paint would be better off in
the warmth of the barn tonight?

08:10.333 --> 08:11.634
Not out in the field.

08:11.668 --> 08:13.448
I think he's fine where he is.

08:13.468 --> 08:15.170
But it's gonna get cold.

08:19.942 --> 08:22.274
I'll tell you a story.

08:23.366 --> 08:26.480
When I was a kid
my dad had a horse.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.618
It was a good horse -
but he came up lame.

08:30.973 --> 08:33.721
We didn't know why back then.

08:34.039 --> 08:39.251
So dad kept him in the barn,
that barn,

08:39.525 --> 08:41.528
so he could keep an eye on him.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.230
And he went down.
Right there in the stall.

08:44.265 --> 08:46.266
But we couldn't help him
'cause there was no room

08:46.300 --> 08:50.403
to maneuver in there
and it was a hell of a scene.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.881
What happened to the horse?

08:57.562 --> 09:00.780
Grandpa, Paint is
not at that point yet. Okay?

09:00.814 --> 09:02.448
We can get him back into shape.
It's my fault.

09:02.483 --> 09:04.049
I've been working with Bear
and Buddy,

09:04.084 --> 09:06.486
I've hardly spent any time
with him.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.087
And I've been so busy practicing
with Phoenix and Trouble,

09:08.121 --> 09:09.589
I haven't had much time
for Paint either.

09:09.623 --> 09:12.191
Yeah, we'll get him back
into our routine.

09:12.225 --> 09:15.227
Massaging his legs
was helping a lot.

09:15.609 --> 09:18.786
Girls, this is not my first rodeo.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.815
I know that when a horse his age
has bad osteo arthritis

09:23.835 --> 09:26.970
and he goes down,
it's not a good sign.

09:28.969 --> 09:33.010
It means he's more than likely
to go down again.

09:33.044 --> 09:35.613
Am I right, Ty?

09:35.647 --> 09:37.214
Yeah. I agree.

09:37.248 --> 09:40.551
Um, but if it does get cold
tonight, Jack,

09:40.585 --> 09:42.686
his stiffness is only
gonna get worse.

09:42.721 --> 09:46.089
So that's something
you got to think about.

09:46.124 --> 09:48.826
Fine. Bring him in,

09:48.860 --> 09:50.828
I'll spend the night
out there with him.

09:50.862 --> 09:52.229
Make sure he's all right.

09:52.263 --> 09:53.563
I don't think spending
the night in a cold barn

09:53.597 --> 09:55.799
will be any good for
your arthritis either.

09:55.833 --> 09:59.569
I'm not gonna fall apart
anytime soon.

09:59.603 --> 10:02.906
I dunno, you got that birthday
coming up and everything.

10:04.842 --> 10:08.178
I'm just trying to cheer you
up. It's not the big one. Yet.

10:08.212 --> 10:10.847
Right?

10:10.881 --> 10:13.516
You certainly haven't lost
your appetite, have you?

10:13.551 --> 10:15.152
I like that. That's good.

10:15.186 --> 10:16.839
Okay.

10:18.088 --> 10:19.355
- Here, switch me sides.
- Yep.

10:19.389 --> 10:21.891
I'll go up first here.

10:21.926 --> 10:23.292
Where'd you get that?

10:23.327 --> 10:24.961
At a yard sale. Isn't it great?

10:24.995 --> 10:27.630
You're not taking it up there.
It'll just get in the way.

10:27.665 --> 10:29.031
We're still under construction.

10:29.066 --> 10:31.434
I know that. But it's
the first piece furniture

10:31.469 --> 10:32.836
that I have ever bought.

10:32.870 --> 10:34.403
And I just want to see
how it looks.

10:34.438 --> 10:36.673
I'm gonna sit at it and pretend
that I live there already.

10:36.707 --> 10:39.375
I know she's crazy.
But I still married her.

10:41.011 --> 10:42.678
Come on. Okay, hold on. Hold on.

10:42.712 --> 10:45.080
- Not so fast.
- Not so fast? Okay.

10:45.114 --> 10:46.081
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?

10:46.115 --> 10:48.617
Oh God!

10:48.651 --> 10:51.052
Wow. He just fell
down? That's pretty scary.

10:51.087 --> 10:52.688
Yeah, it was.

10:52.722 --> 10:56.792
And I'm really worried about
Jack. He's had Paint forever.

10:56.826 --> 10:58.126
Things suck right now.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.595
- I bet.
- And math!

10:59.629 --> 11:02.063
I totally failed the last
three tests.

11:02.098 --> 11:04.199
Now Lou's gonna make me
have a tutor.

11:04.233 --> 11:06.167
- I'll help.
- Hey.

11:06.202 --> 11:07.603
Math's my best subject.

11:07.637 --> 11:11.072
I'm finishing the year on-line.
It's, it's going great.

11:11.107 --> 11:12.474
We could work on-line together.

11:12.508 --> 11:14.709
Yeah, totally.
That would be so cool.

11:14.743 --> 11:17.512
Um, actually, I gotta go.
Can I call you tomorrow?

11:17.546 --> 11:19.814
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

11:22.030 --> 11:23.851
Your teacher's pretty
old school.

11:23.886 --> 11:26.754
I don't think she's gonna let
you finish that course on-line.

11:26.788 --> 11:29.924
Well, even if she doesn't
let me do it on-line,

11:29.958 --> 11:34.595
Stephen can still help me study.
We don't need to pay a tutor.

11:34.630 --> 11:37.932
Okay well, I'll talk to
Mrs. Haggis about it on Monday.

12:12.024 --> 12:15.169
And folks I want you
to know, Jack just told me...

12:15.203 --> 12:17.003
he's such an imaginative guy

12:17.038 --> 12:20.574
he's gonna call this new horse
of his... wait for it...

12:20.608 --> 12:22.176
Paint!

12:34.226 --> 12:36.299
He seems a lot more comfortable today.

12:36.314 --> 12:39.500
His joints have definitely
cooled down.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.818
- Ty showed me what to look for.
- Oh?

12:41.853 --> 12:44.754
He'll be okay. Amy and I
will make sure of it.

12:44.789 --> 12:46.957
We need to take it day by day, Georgie.

12:46.992 --> 12:49.393
There's no miracle recovery.
Not at his age.

12:49.427 --> 12:51.495
Don't be so negative.

12:51.529 --> 12:54.698
I'm not being negative.
I'm just being realistic.

12:56.534 --> 12:59.433
Well, if it's time for Paint, it's time.

12:59.971 --> 13:03.607
When a horse can't get up,
it's a sign of things to come.

13:03.641 --> 13:08.044
Well, soon, he might not
be able to lie down

13:08.078 --> 13:09.779
and that's just as bad.

13:09.814 --> 13:13.282
Yeah, but that's like
the worst case scenario.

13:13.317 --> 13:14.651
How is he doing?

13:14.685 --> 13:17.053
Ah, Great!
He's doing really great.

13:17.087 --> 13:20.990
Hey, boy.
Listen, sweetheart, um,

13:21.024 --> 13:22.992
I was wondering if you could
come and help me out

13:23.026 --> 13:24.527
at Maggie's for a while?

13:24.561 --> 13:27.663
One of the waitresses
is late getting in.

13:27.697 --> 13:31.386
Yeah, you go on.
I'll stay here with Paint.

13:32.468 --> 13:35.838
Uh, okay.
All right, see ya, buddy.

13:40.043 --> 13:42.644
I don't know. It's not due
for another, like, three weeks.

13:42.678 --> 13:46.047
Yeah, but we still
need a better hypothesis.

13:46.081 --> 13:47.515
I think our hypothesis is fine.

13:47.550 --> 13:49.584
Can I get you guys anything?

13:49.618 --> 13:51.019
No. Thank you.

13:51.053 --> 13:53.054
I'll have another decaf
skim milk mocha cappuccino

13:53.088 --> 13:55.990
with cinnamon on top
but hold the whip cream.

13:56.025 --> 13:58.159
Well, maybe just a little.

13:58.193 --> 14:00.094
Okay, I'll have to write
this down.

14:00.128 --> 14:01.761
I'll make it.

14:04.199 --> 14:07.334
- Who is that guy?
- New kid at school.

14:07.369 --> 14:08.969
And lucky me got paired
to work with him

14:09.003 --> 14:10.571
on this biology project.

14:10.605 --> 14:14.442
He is driving me absolutely
insane.

14:14.476 --> 14:16.977
He's totally super smart,
but he's the most arrogant jerk

14:17.011 --> 14:18.946
that I have ever
had to spend time with.

14:18.980 --> 14:22.183
I'd almost rather fail this project
than have to work with him on it.

14:22.217 --> 14:24.585
But, I can't let him
get the top mark.

14:24.619 --> 14:26.753
That is not gonna happen
in my lifetime.

14:26.788 --> 14:28.555
Can we get back at it?

14:28.590 --> 14:32.320
I don't have all day to spend in
this mediocre temple of kitsch.

14:33.595 --> 14:38.031
Excuse me, my mom owns this
"mediocre temple of kitsch"

14:38.066 --> 14:39.766
and for your information
it's the best diner

14:39.801 --> 14:43.470
in the whole town, the whole
area, the whole province!

14:43.504 --> 14:44.971
Right.

14:45.005 --> 14:46.305
We still need a better hypothesis

14:46.339 --> 14:48.574
than the lame one
you came up with.

14:55.181 --> 14:57.583
So, I just read about
a herbal extraction

14:57.618 --> 14:59.551
that is good for arthritic horses.

14:59.586 --> 15:02.354
Apparently, it's got celery
seed, dandelion root,

15:02.388 --> 15:04.590
willow extract...
I mean, it's all the good stuff.

15:04.624 --> 15:05.824
I ordered some on-line.

15:05.858 --> 15:07.359
It should be here
in the next couple of days.

15:07.393 --> 15:08.893
I should put some of that
in my own food.

15:08.928 --> 15:10.262
Maybe it'll work on me.

15:10.296 --> 15:12.964
I'll let Lou know.

15:14.430 --> 15:17.769
Georgie massaged his legs
for an hour this morning.

15:17.803 --> 15:20.372
He seems a little easier.

15:20.406 --> 15:22.634
She should keep doing that.

15:26.879 --> 15:28.747
Scott suggested we continue
the injections

15:28.781 --> 15:31.049
of the hyaluronic acid
into his joints.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.416
It has an anti-inflammatory effect

15:32.451 --> 15:35.353
and it'll also thicken
the synovial fluid as well...

15:35.387 --> 15:38.421
- Over time.
- Don't give me the vet jargon.

15:38.456 --> 15:41.525
He's been getting those injections
for the past few months.

15:41.559 --> 15:43.527
It's done some good.
No doubt about it.

15:43.561 --> 15:48.464
But over time? I don't know
that we have that time.

15:49.701 --> 15:55.603
Ty, we both know that yesterday
was a first.

15:55.940 --> 15:57.675
Yeah. It was.

15:57.709 --> 16:01.111
So, you'll tell me, won't you-
as a vet, when you think...

16:01.146 --> 16:05.521
Jack, it's... it's too soon,
you know,

16:05.541 --> 16:07.384
to go down that road.

16:07.418 --> 16:09.886
I hope so. But you were
straight with me

16:09.920 --> 16:12.389
when you told me it was time
to stop riding Paint.

16:12.423 --> 16:13.723
I want you to be straight
with me now.

16:13.757 --> 16:15.925
I don't want you dealing
with this any different

16:15.959 --> 16:18.561
just 'cause it's my horse.

16:18.581 --> 16:21.857
I won't. I promise.

16:30.050 --> 16:31.775
How you doing?

16:32.494 --> 16:34.210
I'm good.

16:38.182 --> 16:40.036
I know what you're going through.

16:40.185 --> 16:42.719
You don't have to pretend
with me.

16:42.928 --> 16:47.976
I admit, seeing him down
like that, struggling...

16:48.458 --> 16:51.493
it unnerved me, for sure.

16:51.528 --> 16:53.462
Me and Paint, we've been through
a fair bit.

16:53.496 --> 16:55.931
Yeah. Well, you've been
together many years.

16:55.965 --> 16:59.968
I can't help but think,
if it hadn't been for Paint

17:00.002 --> 17:02.938
he stuck right by me
when I had my heart attack.

17:02.972 --> 17:04.573
I know.

17:04.608 --> 17:07.943
Tim said he would've driven
right by me that night.

17:07.977 --> 17:11.646
He saw Paint standing there,

17:11.666 --> 17:15.583
just standing in that field
all on his own,

17:15.617 --> 17:20.672
and Tim knew, he knew something
was wrong.

17:22.657 --> 17:24.892
Probably wishes he had
just driven by.

17:24.925 --> 17:26.728
Oh, stop it!

17:31.062 --> 17:33.067
- You good with those?
- Yeah.

17:37.438 --> 17:39.942
- Hi, I'm Adam Parker.
- Hi!

17:39.962 --> 17:42.300
I believe Mrs. Haggis
spoke to you about me.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.685
I'm the math tutor.

17:43.705 --> 17:47.524
Right. Okay. I, I hadn't realized Mrs.
Haggis already made the arrangement.

17:47.544 --> 17:50.734
She told me to start as soon
as I could. So here I am.

17:50.754 --> 17:53.287
Okay, well, this is Georgie...

17:53.321 --> 17:55.085
Yeah. We've met.

18:01.528 --> 18:05.741
I cannot possibly do this.
Jade knows that guy.

18:05.761 --> 18:09.558
He's in one of her classes
and she cannot stand him.

18:09.578 --> 18:10.469
He's an arrogant ass.

18:10.504 --> 18:12.705
Listen, you cannot go by
what Jade told you.

18:12.739 --> 18:15.008
Your teacher recommended him highly.

18:15.042 --> 18:17.342
- He's horrible!
- You don't know that!

18:17.376 --> 18:19.878
Yes, I do. He was at Maggie's
this morning

18:19.913 --> 18:21.746
and he called your diner
and I quote,

18:21.781 --> 18:23.984
a "mediocre temple of kitsch".

18:24.004 --> 18:26.418
- He said that?
- Yeah.

18:26.652 --> 18:28.086
Everyone is entitled
to their opinion.

18:29.588 --> 18:32.924
Listen, you have to at least
give this a chance.

18:32.958 --> 18:34.859
Just so you know,
I'm on the clock.

18:34.894 --> 18:37.462
So I only got an hour
to spend with Georgie.

18:37.497 --> 18:39.196
Do you have your books?

18:39.231 --> 18:41.932
I think you better get them.

18:45.852 --> 18:48.772
So Georgie tells me
that she already met you

18:48.806 --> 18:51.142
- this morning at Maggie's.
- Yes.

18:51.176 --> 18:53.110
Well, I hope you enjoyed your meal.

18:53.145 --> 18:54.711
I didn't eat anything.

18:54.746 --> 18:56.980
Oh. Most people who come into
the diner

18:57.015 --> 18:59.650
can't resist our breakfast menu.

18:59.684 --> 19:02.218
The statistics are too risky.

19:02.253 --> 19:03.854
I couldn't help but notice that the
area of your preparation kitchen

19:03.888 --> 19:05.989
is far too small and
ill-equipped to serve

19:06.024 --> 19:08.527
the amount of tables that occupy
your restaurant space.

19:08.547 --> 19:12.262
Oh. Well, you know,
it's, it's been working so far.

19:12.296 --> 19:14.064
Thousands of, of satisfied,

19:14.098 --> 19:18.802
actually more than satisfied
customers. Repeat customers.

19:18.836 --> 19:21.071
But, you know,
you're the math whiz

19:21.105 --> 19:26.008
who knows all about area and
statistics. So you would know.

19:27.616 --> 19:31.781
I actually have an MBA from
Columbia University in NYC.

19:31.815 --> 19:34.850
Yeah, I majored in marketing.
Graduated top of my class.

19:37.121 --> 19:38.688
So...

19:40.657 --> 19:43.693
You're crazy. I can't believe
you let him intimidate you.

19:43.727 --> 19:45.227
He did. He intimidated me.

19:45.261 --> 19:46.528
I mean, how is that possible?

19:46.563 --> 19:49.098
He's no more than 15, maybe 16,

19:49.132 --> 19:51.533
and he looked me
right in the eye

19:51.568 --> 19:54.669
and made me feel like I had
to give him my credentials.

19:54.704 --> 19:57.973
I don't know. There's something
kinda weird about that kid.

19:58.007 --> 20:00.942
Poor Georgie. You know,
you're really hitting a home run

20:00.977 --> 20:03.411
with this whole tutoring thing.

20:06.215 --> 20:07.848
You're not making any sense.

20:07.882 --> 20:10.651
I'm making total sense.
You obviously just don't get

20:10.685 --> 20:11.986
what I'm trying to explain to you.

20:12.020 --> 20:13.521
When I took this job
I thought you at least

20:13.555 --> 20:14.888
understood the basic concept.

20:14.923 --> 20:18.126
- I do.
- No. Actually, you don't.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.927
Okay... Example...

20:19.961 --> 20:21.629
You know that when you ride
a bicycle up a steep hill

20:21.663 --> 20:23.564
it takes much more of an effort
than it would

20:23.599 --> 20:25.899
to travel on a level road,
right?

20:25.934 --> 20:28.302
Well, duh, of course I know that.

20:28.337 --> 20:29.937
Good. The slope of the line
is defined as the ratio

20:29.971 --> 20:32.873
of the rise to the run.
So slope equals rise over run.

20:32.907 --> 20:35.375
Letter "m" is used
to represent the slope.

20:35.409 --> 20:39.046
And m equals y2 - y1 over x2 - x1.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.480
It's so simple.

20:40.515 --> 20:42.382
Well, why does "m" represent
"slope"

20:42.416 --> 20:45.152
if "slope" starts with
the letter "s".

20:47.522 --> 20:49.657
Hello there. I'm Jack.

20:51.225 --> 20:53.560
You know, I think it is
real good of you

20:53.594 --> 20:55.696
to help Georgie out like this.

20:55.730 --> 20:58.011
Mrs. Fleming-Morris
is paying me.

20:58.799 --> 21:03.002
Well... that makes it even
better then, doesn't it?

21:08.842 --> 21:10.677
Git up!

21:10.711 --> 21:12.011
Come on.

21:13.446 --> 21:16.649
Good boy.
That's it, there you go.

21:16.684 --> 21:19.017
I'm glad he's limbered up.

21:19.052 --> 21:21.987
The injection took away a lot of
that stiffness and discomfort.

21:22.021 --> 21:25.023
Yes. I do believe my herbs
had some effect too there,

21:25.058 --> 21:26.559
Dr. Borden.

21:26.593 --> 21:28.227
I have no doubt.

21:28.261 --> 21:30.929
Look at that.
He's doing pretty good.

21:30.963 --> 21:33.131
Yeah, a little light exercise
isn't going to hurt him.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.966
In fact, you were right, Jack.

21:35.001 --> 21:37.169
He should be left out in that
field now that it's warmer.

21:37.203 --> 21:39.571
He'll just stiffen up a lot more
if he's left in his stall.

21:39.605 --> 21:41.744
Okay. Let's turn him out.

21:41.764 --> 21:44.041
All right. Well, I'll gonna walk
him around for a bit more first.

21:44.076 --> 21:48.284
I wanted to thank you two
for all your work.

21:48.545 --> 21:52.684
I'm feeling way more optimistic.

21:58.724 --> 22:02.059
I can come over tomorrow.
I got an hour in the evening.

22:02.094 --> 22:06.496
Fine. I don't have a choice
in the matter, but fine.

22:06.531 --> 22:09.035
That's a nice looking horse.

22:09.835 --> 22:11.635
He's moving kind of slow, isn't he?

22:11.669 --> 22:13.604
I mean I don't know much
about horses but...

22:13.638 --> 22:17.074
Wait, really? Something you
don't know much about?

22:17.109 --> 22:19.109
Awesome!

22:19.143 --> 22:20.844
Very funny.

22:22.980 --> 22:24.648
The reason
he's moving so slow

22:24.682 --> 22:28.218
is because he's getting old,
and he has advanced arthritis.

22:28.253 --> 22:29.919
He went down
in the field yesterday,

22:29.954 --> 22:31.154
and he couldn't get up.

22:31.188 --> 22:34.758
We've been working with him
and he's getting better.

22:34.792 --> 22:36.693
I guess you spend a time
working with anything,

22:36.728 --> 22:38.495
it gets better.

22:38.529 --> 22:41.130
Maybe there's even hope for you.

22:44.801 --> 22:47.270
You're totally right.
The guy is a robot!

22:47.304 --> 22:49.104
He thinks he knows everything.

22:49.139 --> 22:52.040
Actually, he does know everything.
That's what's so annoying.

22:52.075 --> 22:53.743
I've got to get out of this somehow.

22:53.777 --> 22:56.011
No worries.

22:56.045 --> 22:58.748
I know exactly how to get rid
of him. Leave it to me.

23:03.675 --> 23:07.249
I got to say he is looking
even better this morning.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.357
Yee-aw!

23:11.698 --> 23:15.101
Oh, look at that!
He's pretty spry!

23:15.135 --> 23:17.572
Hey? Yeah.

23:18.005 --> 23:21.607
That's more like it,
isn't it boy? Yeah.

23:21.642 --> 23:24.143
Yeah, you feelin'
more like yourself?

23:24.177 --> 23:26.612
Hey Jack, Amy and I gotta run
into town to do some errands

23:26.646 --> 23:29.014
but we'll be back in a bit.
Is that okay?

23:29.048 --> 23:32.217
Yeah. Not a worry.
I'll take over from here.

23:32.252 --> 23:36.265
We might even go on a walk,
you and me. What do you say?

23:36.285 --> 23:39.404
It's a good idea.
Spend some time with him.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.195
Oh, I didn't mean it like that.

23:43.229 --> 23:45.531
I, I think he's doing really
well.

23:45.565 --> 23:47.198
I'd tell you otherwise.

23:53.338 --> 23:55.807
You have to agree,
Paint is way better.

23:57.977 --> 23:59.844
He is, right?

24:01.113 --> 24:02.981
Ty?

24:03.015 --> 24:05.616
He's not out of the danger zone yet.

24:05.651 --> 24:07.617
You saw the way he ran to grandpa.

24:07.652 --> 24:09.664
I know it seems like
he's bouncing back,

24:09.684 --> 24:12.156
but Scott and I have seen this
thing time and time again.

24:12.190 --> 24:13.924
It could be temporary.

24:13.958 --> 24:16.994
I think that you are overreacting.

24:17.028 --> 24:18.996
Amy, I'm not-this is...

24:19.030 --> 24:21.065
You're just worried
because Scott isn't here,

24:21.099 --> 24:23.233
and you're thinking
of the worst case scenario

24:23.267 --> 24:24.568
that you might have to deal with.

24:24.602 --> 24:26.570
I'm not trying to be negative, okay?

24:26.604 --> 24:29.472
It's just that's been my experience.

24:29.507 --> 24:30.852
Is that the picture?

24:30.872 --> 24:34.143
Yes. The whole reason we're
going into town, right?

24:34.178 --> 24:36.580
Just relax.

25:00.303 --> 25:02.939
Look at that herd.

25:02.973 --> 25:05.541
We've spent a fair bit of our
lives running those cattle

25:05.575 --> 25:09.078
back and forth to the high
country, haven't we?

25:09.113 --> 25:11.614
Rain, sleet, hail, snow...

25:11.648 --> 25:14.014
You name it. We've ridden in it.

25:16.219 --> 25:18.554
Oh, you just take it easy now.

25:18.588 --> 25:21.423
You let us wait on you
for a change.

25:21.891 --> 25:23.595
About time.

25:32.601 --> 25:34.535
- Hey Lou!
- Hey, Jade! How's it' going?

25:34.570 --> 25:36.643
Uh, pretty good.

25:36.663 --> 25:39.106
But the summer's coming up
and I thought I'd put out

25:39.141 --> 25:40.975
some feelers about a job.

25:41.009 --> 25:44.011
Maggie's, the Dude ranch?
Any chances?

25:44.045 --> 25:46.080
Oh well, you know,
there's still definitely time

25:46.114 --> 25:47.915
to think about that.

25:47.949 --> 25:50.584
Look, I know my track record
in regards to working for you

25:50.618 --> 25:52.887
isn't exactly stellar but...

25:52.921 --> 25:54.421
I thought you were totally involved

25:54.455 --> 25:57.024
with my dad's school
and the rodeos and...?

25:57.058 --> 25:58.425
Well, that depends on this.

25:58.459 --> 26:00.895
Right. The broken ankle.
How's that going?

26:00.929 --> 26:03.130
It's pretty good.
I can totally drive now.

26:03.165 --> 26:05.166
Nice.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.235
So, I heard that Adam Parker
is tutoring Georgie?

26:08.270 --> 26:09.870
Yes, he is
and I hope it works out

26:09.905 --> 26:12.772
because Georgie needs
to pass math.

26:12.807 --> 26:14.941
Yeah...
It's probably a good thing.

26:14.975 --> 26:17.811
Jade, I am well aware
that you don't like Adam,

26:17.845 --> 26:19.612
but I would prefer it if you
could keep your opinion

26:19.646 --> 26:22.682
to yourself and not, you know,
influence Georgie.

26:22.716 --> 26:24.623
Absolutely.

26:26.987 --> 26:29.422
- What?
- It's nothing.

26:29.456 --> 26:31.557
What's nothing?

26:31.591 --> 26:34.828
It's just that, you know,
people talk and...

26:34.862 --> 26:37.029
some of the kids at school
who have been tutored by Adam

26:37.063 --> 26:39.598
have mentioned that...

26:39.633 --> 26:42.935
well... Anyways, it doesn't matter.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.337
Is Georgie around?

26:44.371 --> 26:47.840
Uh, she's in the barn
or out in the field.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.171
Hey, Jade!

26:49.191 --> 26:52.244
If um, if there's something
about Adam I should know,

26:52.278 --> 26:54.980
I mean, you would tell me, right?

26:55.014 --> 26:58.317
Yeah. It's just my opinion
and you're right,

26:58.352 --> 27:00.820
I should keep it to myself.

27:08.527 --> 27:11.529
So, my plan is now in motion.

27:11.564 --> 27:13.065
What did you say to her?

27:13.099 --> 27:15.033
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.002
But that's the whole point
of my strategy.

27:17.036 --> 27:21.639
It made Lou crazy thinking that I knew
something about Adam that she didn't.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.581
That's all you got to do sometimes.

27:23.601 --> 27:26.744
Make people think you've got
information even though you don't.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.980
Wait, isn't that, like,
a little mean to him, though?

27:29.014 --> 27:32.183
You want results, right?
You want him out?

27:32.217 --> 27:33.985
Yeah. Yeah, I definitely do.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.787
Then I can go back to Plan A
and work with Stephen on-line.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.924
Stephen. How is Stephen?
Fill me in, kid.

27:39.958 --> 27:41.192
Uh, he's really good.

27:41.226 --> 27:43.594
We're actually gonna go on
a date when he gets back.

27:43.628 --> 27:45.763
Tell me everything.

27:45.797 --> 27:47.664
Oh no...

27:47.699 --> 27:49.733
Paint?

27:49.768 --> 27:51.034
Whoa.

27:52.904 --> 27:54.772
Oh, buds.

27:54.806 --> 27:57.808
- What's wrong with him?
- He's got to get up.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.309
He's gotta get up.

27:59.343 --> 28:01.645
Paint! You gotta get up!
He has to get up!

28:01.679 --> 28:04.013
No, I've gotta go find Jack!
You just stay here!

28:04.047 --> 28:05.381
Try not to let him hurt himself.

28:05.416 --> 28:07.750
Well, I'm kind of handicapped here.

28:07.785 --> 28:10.653
C'mon, Paint.
C'mon, buddy. You can get up.

28:14.157 --> 28:17.827
Jack! Jack! Where are you??

28:17.861 --> 28:19.995
Jack!!

28:20.030 --> 28:21.931
It's Paint.

28:31.574 --> 28:34.108
Hi. You're a good boy.

28:34.143 --> 28:35.877
How's he doing?

28:35.912 --> 28:38.914
He can't get up.

28:38.948 --> 28:43.784
C'mon, Paint. You can get up.
You can. C'mon!

28:43.819 --> 28:45.953
Ty, it's Paint!

28:50.525 --> 28:52.192
I'll be right back.

28:54.596 --> 28:56.597
Grandpa!

28:56.631 --> 29:00.200
I need your help!
He's not doing well!

29:00.234 --> 29:02.869
Whoa.

29:24.858 --> 29:27.258
You can do this.
I believe in you. C'mon!

29:27.293 --> 29:28.927
C'mon!

29:30.296 --> 29:33.064
Get up, dammit! Let's go now!

29:35.825 --> 29:39.437
C'mon, Paint. You're a good boy.
You stand up.

29:52.345 --> 29:53.985
Jade?

29:55.988 --> 29:57.655
Okay.

30:00.158 --> 30:01.825
C'mon.

30:03.728 --> 30:06.063
Ready?

31:08.638 --> 31:10.306
Jack.

31:13.305 --> 31:16.573
You told me you wanted me
to be straight with you.

31:16.607 --> 31:18.477
And now I have to be.

31:19.061 --> 31:21.704
His lungs are fillin' up.

31:22.126 --> 31:25.268
Yeah. I know. It's time.

31:34.029 --> 31:35.872
Jack?

31:35.892 --> 31:37.727
It's all right.

31:37.761 --> 31:40.416
I know what I have to do.

31:48.405 --> 31:50.373
Amy.

31:56.379 --> 31:57.847
I think you should go.

31:57.881 --> 31:59.949
I want to stay.

31:59.983 --> 32:02.388
I need you to take the girls.

32:05.889 --> 32:08.090
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:11.449 --> 32:12.926
C'mon, guys.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.503
Okay, let's get all
the animals back in the barn.

32:22.537 --> 32:24.739
Hee-haw. Hee-haw.

32:27.009 --> 32:29.477
- Jack?
- Grandpa?

32:32.514 --> 32:33.747
Is Paint okay?

32:37.085 --> 32:39.208
Grandpa?

32:59.973 --> 33:01.440
Stand behind me.

33:52.991 --> 33:55.459
I can't do it, Ty.

34:06.537 --> 34:08.304
Do you want me to...

34:10.885 --> 34:12.308
Jack?

34:12.342 --> 34:13.577
Yeah...

34:15.451 --> 34:18.217
Yeah. I need you to do it your way.

34:19.732 --> 34:21.010
Okay.

34:37.933 --> 34:39.734
That's a boy.

34:39.768 --> 34:41.755
That's a good boy.

35:01.363 --> 35:03.289
What's wrong, mommy?

35:20.585 --> 35:21.900
Hey.

35:22.893 --> 35:24.159
Hey.

35:29.341 --> 35:32.195
Grandpa said you were amazing.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.935
That he couldn't have done it
without you.

35:35.955 --> 35:37.289
Hmm.

35:39.172 --> 35:41.627
And that it was really peaceful.

35:43.192 --> 35:44.396
Yeah.

35:47.693 --> 35:49.735
Yeah. How is Jack?

35:52.570 --> 35:54.233
- He's okay.
- Yeah?

35:56.168 --> 35:59.510
Mm-hmm. He went out for
a drive with Lisa.

36:00.639 --> 36:02.290
That's good.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.993
I'm so sorry.

36:16.526 --> 36:17.978
I know...

36:22.370 --> 36:25.503
Bye, Jade. I'm really glad
you were here.

36:38.567 --> 36:40.084
Hi.

36:41.487 --> 36:43.538
Georgie and I have an appointment.

36:43.558 --> 36:47.174
Um, Adam, it's a...
it's a bad time.

36:47.194 --> 36:50.428
I'm sorry, but I don't think
that Georgie can do it today.

36:50.462 --> 36:52.538
Fine. But it's not
a good plan to put it off.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.436
If she wants to do well
on the test on Wednesday,

36:54.456 --> 36:57.468
she doesn't have a lot of time
to get ready for it.

37:01.033 --> 37:04.220
Adam... maybe it's not a good idea

37:04.240 --> 37:06.995
for you to continue to tutor, Georgie.

37:07.119 --> 37:08.345
Why?

37:10.743 --> 37:14.731
Um... You know what?
Adam came all the way out here.

37:14.751 --> 37:16.356
It'd be rude to cancel.

37:16.376 --> 37:19.322
I'm okay.
Let's just get on with it.

37:34.752 --> 37:37.140
What's wrong? That's one
of the easiest questions.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.306
I know! And I'm sorry.

37:38.340 --> 37:41.442
But I'm trying really hard
to concentrate, but...

37:43.998 --> 37:46.008
Hey, buddy. Hey.

37:49.918 --> 37:52.220
Her name is Remi.

37:52.254 --> 37:54.122
Hi, Remi.

37:58.293 --> 38:00.628
That horse you saw yesterday?

38:00.662 --> 38:02.196
The brown and white one?

38:02.230 --> 38:03.998
Yeah. He collapsed again today,

38:04.032 --> 38:08.838
but this time he couldn't
get on his feet.

38:09.570 --> 38:12.039
So we had to put him down.

38:13.609 --> 38:17.467
Oh. I'm sorry. That's...

38:19.514 --> 38:21.882
I'm really sorry.

38:24.152 --> 38:26.987
Digger died a couple months ago.

38:27.021 --> 38:29.745
- Digger?
- My dog.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.170
Had him since I was
six years old.

38:34.095 --> 38:35.962
He had to be put down too.

38:35.997 --> 38:37.824
Cancer.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.988
My family was all pretty
devastated.

38:42.167 --> 38:43.970
We still are.

38:45.473 --> 38:48.215
It's true what Konrad Lorenz said.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.210
Who?

38:50.245 --> 38:51.878
Konrad Lorenz?

38:51.912 --> 38:55.849
He's famous. He won
a Nobel Prize in 1973.

38:55.883 --> 38:59.786
Oh. That Konrad Lorenz.
Of course.

38:59.820 --> 39:01.955
Konrad was cool.

39:01.989 --> 39:06.759
He studied animal behaviour.
He was the leader in that field.

39:06.793 --> 39:11.197
And uh, something he wrote really
helped me when Digger died.

39:11.231 --> 39:13.479
I'll give you the link.

39:17.237 --> 39:19.672
You remember links by heart?

39:19.706 --> 39:21.474
I have a photographic memory.

39:24.409 --> 39:28.347
If you want, I could come over
after school tomorrow.

39:28.382 --> 39:32.685
Uh... I won't charge you for today.

39:54.139 --> 39:56.974
"The fidelity of a dog
is a precious gift

39:57.009 --> 39:59.944
demanding no less binding
moral responsibilities

39:59.978 --> 40:03.369
than the friendship
of a human being.

40:04.217 --> 40:08.853
The bond with a dog is as lasting as
the ties of this earth can ever be."

40:10.923 --> 40:12.857
Hi, Rem!

40:54.897 --> 40:56.287
Jack.

40:58.484 --> 41:00.068
I know it's not
your birthday yet,

41:00.102 --> 41:01.970
and I know you
kinda hate birthdays,

41:02.004 --> 41:04.416
but I wanted to give you this.

41:09.645 --> 41:11.846
Thank you, Georgie.

41:17.404 --> 41:20.989
I have a little something
in the office for you, too.

41:21.023 --> 41:22.856
All right. All right.

41:22.891 --> 41:25.926
I don't want you two going
around hugging me all the time.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.662
I'm fine. I'm good.

41:28.696 --> 41:30.624
But, thank you...

41:30.644 --> 41:32.612
Both of you.

41:35.540 --> 41:37.240
C'mon.

42:10.269 --> 42:14.906
Yes, let's hear it for
Jack Bartlett!

42:14.941 --> 42:17.643
He's been entertaining us all
for the past 20 years

42:17.677 --> 42:19.911
in this very arena.

42:21.715 --> 42:24.550
Happy retirement, Jack,
and we wish you all the best

42:24.584 --> 42:26.818
on that brand new paint horse of yours.

42:26.853 --> 42:31.656
We're glad you accepted him
as a token of our appreciation.

42:31.690 --> 42:34.993
And folks I want you to know,
Jack just told me

42:35.027 --> 42:37.362
he's such an imaginative guy

42:37.396 --> 42:40.698
He's gonna call this new horse
of his, wait for it...

42:40.733 --> 42:42.033
Paint!

42:56.581 --> 42:59.049
Dear Jack,

42:59.084 --> 43:02.353
"The fidelity of a horse
is a precious gift

43:02.387 --> 43:05.990

43:33.868 --> 43:34.886
Go!

43:34.906 --> 43:36.019
Time is critical.

43:36.021 --> 43:38.400
It's not your responsibility
to find grandpa a new horse.

43:38.420 --> 43:41.627
A family pulls together to
put grandpa back in the saddle.

43:41.647 --> 43:42.926
What if he never rides again?

43:42.928 --> 43:44.594
Move out that swing, Georgie.

43:44.596 --> 43:46.114
Why don't you get on him,
show me how it's done?

43:46.134 --> 43:49.096
Heartland,
next Sunday at 7:00 on CBC.
