00:16.306 --> 00:17.976
<i>An impenetrable defense.</i>

00:18.101 --> 00:21.771
<i>Separatist ships blocking
the resource rich planet of Christophsis.</i>

00:21.896 --> 00:24.983
<i>Trapping Senator Bail
Organa and his relief effort.</i>

00:25.233 --> 00:28.778
<i>Desperate to aid the steem Senator,
A Republic task force,</i>

00:28.945 --> 00:31.489
<i>Under the command of jedi
knight Anakin Skywalker,</i>

00:31.656 --> 00:33.324
<i>Must break the impass.</i>

00:33.616 --> 00:35.994
<i>But time runs short for the Senator.</i>

00:36.161 --> 00:38.455
<i>And the good citizens of Christophsis.</i>

00:42.167 --> 00:44.836
Separatist forces have
overrun our position.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.090
<i>And we are out of food, water and munitions.</i>

00:49.215 --> 00:50.884
<i>Our situation is desperate.</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:53.678
<i>Senator Organa? Senator Organa!</i>

00:53.970 --> 00:56.389
General, another cruiser has been hit.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.641
Master Kenobi better get here soon.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.227
Or this is gonna be
one short rescue mission

01:06.483 --> 01:08.777
The command ship is barring down on us.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.870
Pull all our shields.
Incoming fire.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.708
This isn't gonna be easy.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.716
Fire all forward canons.

01:31.841 --> 01:35.637
Cut off those Republic supply ships.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.516
Separate them from their escort cruisers.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.144
I smell fear.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.439
And it smells good.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.324
General. One of the supply ships has been hit.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.159
Overfire all reactors.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.287
We're gonna blow right
past this guy. Whoever he is.

02:03.456 --> 02:07.293
General, a republic cruiser is coming
out of the hyperspace behind us.

02:07.919 --> 02:08.794
Obi-Wan.

02:14.217 --> 02:17.095
Looks like General Skywalker's
already engaged the enemy.

02:17.220 --> 02:21.641
That's nothing out of the ordinary, especially
since i gave my direct order not to.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.858
The Republic ship is not
breaking off its attack.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.526
Hold the line.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.487
Contain the fight forward the deflectors.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.748
<i>Anakin, i want you to withdraw.</i>

02:45.123 --> 02:46.207
Withdraw?

02:46.333 --> 02:48.793
<i>I brought a new toy that
might give us an advantage.</i>

02:48.918 --> 02:52.213
With respect, General, now it might
not be a bad time to regroup.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.511
Tell the transports to fall
back to Obi-Wan's position.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.431
We'll cover their retreat
as they escape behind the moon.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.768
I don't like this. I hope Obi-Wan
knows what he's doing.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.121
They are escaping.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.290
- Should we go after them?
- No!

03:27.957 --> 03:31.795
Our orders are to blockade, not chase.

03:32.337 --> 03:36.132
I have won this round.
Recycle the shields,

03:36.257 --> 03:40.845
And let the canons reset
to a full charge.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.430
<i>Rodger, roger.</i>

03:43.473 --> 03:45.684
And the enemy will soon return.

03:46.226 --> 03:50.063
And when they do, we shall be ready.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.509
Well. Here I am.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.221
- Tell me about this new weapon.
- You're looking at it.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.806
I'm looking at what?

04:25.223 --> 04:27.851
Two steps forward
and you'd actually be kissing it.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.525
It's a stealth ship.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.157
That's some trick.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.200
Let's hope the Separatists think so.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.995
So I assume scanners can't detect it.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.665
As far as we know,
but this is the first real field test.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.167
That's encouraging.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.252
I figured you'd be up to the challenge.

04:54.377 --> 05:00.008
So, I can move in undetected
and take them out from behind.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.844
That's pretty small ship
to destroy a whole fleet.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.680
- Are there more?
- No. This is the prototype.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.599
And you won't be on the offensive.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.477
I need you to run a mercy mission
down to the planet surface.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.855
The ship can carry enough supplies
for Senator Organa's headquarters.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.857
Oh, I 'm still the delivery boy?

05:16.107 --> 05:18.860
We don't need the whole fleet.
I can do this myself.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.946
Anakin, slow down and do what I tell you.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.367
It's more important to save lives
than destroy ships.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.786
I need you to continue the mercy mission.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.304
Impossible.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.889
It can't be him.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.142
- Tell General Skywalker to hold this departure.
- Yes, Sir.

06:04.862 --> 06:07.448
Thank you for waiting, Sir.
I'm sorry to hold you up.

06:07.573 --> 06:09.951
No apologies, Admiral.
What have you got?

06:10.076 --> 06:13.871
Something about this morning's
engagement struck me as familiar.

06:14.706 --> 06:17.375
- So, I... I did a bit of research.
- And?

06:17.832 --> 06:19.518
I believe the opposing commander
is none other than Admiral Trench.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.966
If I remember my military history,

06:23.516 --> 06:26.227
Wasn't he vaporized at the battle
of Malastar Arrows?

06:26.352 --> 06:29.605
That's what i thought too.
But the tactics employed,

06:29.731 --> 06:33.484
The efficiency of the droids maneuvers
and then there's this.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.155
The last time i saw that symbol,

06:37.572 --> 06:40.575
Let's just say I lost a lot
of good men that day.

06:41.242 --> 06:42.827
What do I need to know?

06:43.202 --> 06:45.246
I have seen his work first hand.

06:45.621 --> 06:50.585
A corporate fleet was blockading Malastar,
a fleet led by Trench.

06:51.252 --> 06:53.463
That's why I recognized the tactics.

06:53.921 --> 06:56.174
He tore our ships apart.

06:56.299 --> 06:58.468
We barely escaped with our lives.

06:58.843 --> 07:02.555
In the end, the Jedi led task force
moved in to settle the matter.

07:02.889 --> 07:07.143
Trench's ship was destroyed
and we assumed he went down with it.

07:08.019 --> 07:09.604
Are you sure it's him?

07:09.729 --> 07:13.524
It's possible. Not every captain
goes down with their ship.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.986
Well. We may be in luck, then, Admiral.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.656
My orders are not to engage Trench.

07:19.781 --> 07:22.450
Just to deliver supplies
to Senator Organa.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.327
With all due respect, General,

07:24.452 --> 07:27.121
I do not believe we will
have a choice in the matter.

07:27.246 --> 07:31.250
If it is indeed Trench,
he will come for us.

07:31.918 --> 07:32.669
Us?

07:33.169 --> 07:36.881
Yes. I'm voluntaring my services
as consultant, General.

07:37.590 --> 07:38.967
Welcome aboard.

07:40.301 --> 07:42.178
Hurry up, Lucky, we're leaving.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.516
CT1284, Spoke.
Reporting for duty, Sir.

07:46.933 --> 07:51.104
We lost one of our starling line-up, kid.
You ready to step up and take his place?

07:51.229 --> 07:53.398
Yes, Sir. Just show me my station.

07:54.649 --> 07:56.943
You'll be sitting right across from me.

07:57.068 --> 07:59.237
Where I can keep an eye on you.

07:59.362 --> 08:01.197
Till you're up to speed.

08:01.447 --> 08:03.366
Everyone's on board, we are go.

08:03.491 --> 08:06.202
Dispatch, we are powering up
and ready to go.

08:20.258 --> 08:21.801
Going silent in ten.

08:22.385 --> 08:24.470
- System screen.
- Power core steady.

08:24.595 --> 08:27.348
- Double scanning for...
- Engage cloaking device.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.260
Doesn't look like they can detect us.

09:04.385 --> 09:06.179
Yes, but if you get any closer,

09:06.220 --> 09:08.514
They may not need scanners
to know we're here.

09:08.681 --> 09:11.851
Relax, Admiral.
Hey, you wanted to command this, right?

09:15.772 --> 09:19.901
I can not calculate why the Republic
fleet has not launched another attack.

09:21.110 --> 09:25.740
What is their status of the
assault on Chistophsis?

09:25.865 --> 09:27.950
Resistance is crumbling, Sir.

09:28.076 --> 09:31.120
I would estimate a half rotation
before it is over.

09:32.246 --> 09:34.415
We need to add some pressure

09:34.540 --> 09:40.213
on those who were sent to rescue our
enemies on Christophsis.

09:45.093 --> 09:50.181
Send the Hyena bombers to hit
Senator Organa on the surface.

09:51.307 --> 09:56.145
That should draw those cowards
out from behind the moon.

10:15.331 --> 10:18.334
General, we have incoming
bombers with fighters escort.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.550
Enemy ships closing 15000,

10:26.009 --> 10:28.177
14000, 13000.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.555
What's our defensive capability?

10:30.680 --> 10:32.890
Torpedoes and anti-aircraft canons, Sir.

10:33.016 --> 10:34.934
We'd have to decloak to use either.

10:34.976 --> 10:38.771
Yea, and if they don't know we're here,
that'll give our position away pretty quickly.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.777
9000, 8000...

10:45.194 --> 10:46.738
Have they detected us?

10:46.863 --> 10:48.114
Can't tell, Sir.

10:48.239 --> 10:50.867
If we are going on the offense,
we must do it soon.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.162
<i>5000.
4000...</i>

10:55.079 --> 10:58.082
Stay cloaked. Power everything else down.
Let it drift.

11:01.794 --> 11:02.754
2000...

11:05.340 --> 11:06.215
1000...

11:06.633 --> 11:09.302
- They're going to hit us!
- 500...

11:21.898 --> 11:24.192
They missed us.
They don't know we're here.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.402
They're heading for Bail Organa
in the command center.

11:26.527 --> 11:27.987
They're going to bomb it.

11:30.406 --> 11:32.909
Sir, we have incoming bombers.

11:38.039 --> 11:39.916
Get me General Kenobi.

11:40.249 --> 11:42.502
<i>We are under attack
by the separatist fleet.</i>

11:42.537 --> 11:44.587
<i>They're coming by air and by ground.</i>

11:44.921 --> 11:48.341
<i>We can't hold out any longer,
there is little chance of surviving.</i>

11:48.376 --> 11:51.844
<i>Help us, General Kenobi.
You are our only hope.</i>

11:52.095 --> 11:53.471
Get me Anakin.

11:54.889 --> 11:57.099
<i>Anakin, I've just spoken to the Senator.</i>

11:57.134 --> 11:59.275
<i>They're in dire need of our help.</i>

11:59.310 --> 12:01.569
<i>Continue with your mission
to the planet surface.</i>

12:01.604 --> 12:04.649
<i>I will engage Trench's fleet
with the ships I already have.</i>

12:04.684 --> 12:06.491
General Kenobi, with all due respect...

12:06.526 --> 12:09.445
you do not have the resources
to engage Trench openly.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.365
He wants you to attack.
You'll be walking into a trap!

12:12.400 --> 12:13.915
He's right, Master.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.625
You won't stand a chance.

12:15.660 --> 12:19.288
<i>Anakin, I've got enough problems
without you becoming one of them.</i>

12:19.323 --> 12:21.297
<i>Get those supplies
to the refugee camp...</i>

12:21.332 --> 12:23.751
<i>I'll worry about Trench,
just stay on course and--</i>

12:23.786 --> 12:25.712
That tactic won't work.

12:26.296 --> 12:29.966
Prep torpedo tubes one through four,
fix range on Trench's command ship.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.342
Sir?

12:31.801 --> 12:33.240
You heard me, Admiral.

12:33.275 --> 12:34.644
<i>What are you doing?</i>

12:34.679 --> 12:36.479
We need to destroy Trench.

12:36.514 --> 12:39.371
And this ship has the best
chance to do it now.

12:39.406 --> 12:42.228
<i>I want those supplies
on the surface, now.</i>

12:42.603 --> 12:44.689
Don't worry, I'm on it.

12:44.939 --> 12:46.024
<i>Anakin.</i>

12:47.900 --> 12:50.611
The Republic fleet is holding position.

12:50.646 --> 12:52.780
This is unusual.

12:54.866 --> 12:57.660
What can they be planning?

13:06.294 --> 13:08.219
<i>Prepare to de-cloack on my command.</i>

13:08.254 --> 13:11.799
<i>Prep torpedo tubes one through four,
fix range on Trench's command ship.</i>

13:11.834 --> 13:13.850
I thought we were on a release mission.

13:13.885 --> 13:16.763
You'll learn pretty quick when
you serve under General Skywalker...

13:16.798 --> 13:18.229
you're always on the offensive.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.273
Now, get ready to cycle those shields.

13:20.308 --> 13:22.810
You realize our torpedoes
might not be enough?

13:22.845 --> 13:25.313
All I want,
is for Trench to think about us...

13:25.348 --> 13:27.774
instead of the people on the planet below.

13:27.809 --> 13:29.984
It's time to introduce ourselves.

13:31.361 --> 13:34.656
- Activate the thermal charges.
- Release torpedoes safety.

13:35.531 --> 13:37.158
Ready to draw power.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.869
Shield regeneration on stand-by.

13:44.207 --> 13:46.292
Something odd...

13:46.668 --> 13:49.253
is going on out there.

13:51.881 --> 13:53.181
Ready torpedoes.

13:53.216 --> 13:55.301
Lock on to primary target.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.389
Disengage cloaking device.

14:06.312 --> 14:07.355
There!

14:07.397 --> 14:08.690
A cloaked ship!

14:08.898 --> 14:09.941
Fire!

14:13.695 --> 14:15.363
Torpedoes locked and closing.

14:15.398 --> 14:16.906
Activate the shields.

14:23.955 --> 14:26.040
Foolish republic scum.

14:26.290 --> 14:29.085
Your putty torpedoes are no match...

14:29.120 --> 14:31.087
for my thermal shields.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.048
Prepare to fire!
All cannons!

14:36.509 --> 14:38.678
Well, that did little good.

14:38.713 --> 14:40.197
Re-cloaking in 9...

14:40.232 --> 14:41.681
- 8...
- Fire!

14:42.849 --> 14:43.912
6...

14:43.947 --> 14:44.976
5...

14:46.185 --> 14:47.729
Pilot, prep the flares.

14:47.764 --> 14:49.605
Too late, General!

14:53.602 --> 14:55.245
Recloaking in four, three

14:56.280 --> 14:57.170
Launch flares.

15:00.741 --> 15:02.054
And cloak.

15:10.646 --> 15:12.356
Fire a spread of lasers!

15:15.984 --> 15:17.047
Incoming!

15:17.082 --> 15:18.111
I see it.

15:37.130 --> 15:39.132
Scans are coming up negative.

15:39.167 --> 15:40.342
We missed.

15:40.801 --> 15:42.094
Yes.

15:43.345 --> 15:45.722
But we have learned something.

15:46.390 --> 15:51.353
No clone can successfully flight
through that many lasers.

15:51.770 --> 15:53.897
We are dealing...

15:54.273 --> 15:55.440
with a Jedi.

15:57.484 --> 15:59.152
Patch me into the comm channel.

15:59.187 --> 16:01.113
Open frequency.

16:09.079 --> 16:12.124
- What you got, Spark?
- There's a open communication signal...

16:12.159 --> 16:14.877
- ...coming from the enemy.
- Better tell the General.

16:15.711 --> 16:18.463
Now that they know we are here,
what's you plan?

16:19.131 --> 16:20.597
I'll think of something, Admiral.

16:20.632 --> 16:23.135
In the meantime, I've got
Trench right were I wanted it.

16:23.468 --> 16:25.394
- Thinking about us.
- General...

16:25.429 --> 16:27.264
there is a transmission
on the open frequency...

16:27.299 --> 16:29.725
- ...It's the enemy.
- Put it through.

16:32.227 --> 16:33.562
Hello, ugly.

16:34.062 --> 16:36.899
<i>I am Admiral Trench.</i>

16:38.025 --> 16:40.506
<i>If you are listening, Jedi...</i>

16:40.541 --> 16:42.988
<i>you've made a bold move...</i>

16:43.280 --> 16:45.240
<i>and a grave mistake.</i>

16:45.741 --> 16:49.745
<i>I appreciate your decision to face me
ship to ship...</i>

16:49.780 --> 16:51.496
<i>To play this little...</i>

16:51.538 --> 16:52.581
<i>game.</i>

16:53.832 --> 16:57.085
It's been so long since I had
a worthy opponent.

16:57.419 --> 17:00.839
You have an impressive new vessel.

17:01.548 --> 17:02.883
<i>But I warn you...</i>

17:03.550 --> 17:06.553
<i>I have dealt with its kind
before.</i>

17:07.054 --> 17:09.806
<i>Your technology will not save you.</i>

17:10.015 --> 17:13.477
<i>And your friends on the planet below
shall perish.</i>

17:13.512 --> 17:14.895
<i>As a result...</i>

17:15.061 --> 17:16.730
<i>Of your failure.</i>

17:17.606 --> 17:21.193
<i>The people of Christophsis
and her resources...</i>

17:22.611 --> 17:25.571
<i>Shall join the separatist alliance...</i>

17:26.281 --> 17:27.907
<i>Turn back now...</i>

17:27.950 --> 17:29.785
<i>Retreat while you can.</i>

17:29.993 --> 17:32.704
<i>Or I am your...</i>

17:33.038 --> 17:34.081
<i>doom!</i>

17:37.167 --> 17:40.587
He said he's dealt
with this kind of ship before.

17:40.963 --> 17:42.005
How?

17:42.130 --> 17:46.468
I calculate the Jedi will not turn back
as you request, Admiral.

17:48.303 --> 17:49.728
Of course not.

17:49.763 --> 17:51.807
I do not expect him to.

17:52.933 --> 17:54.560
He'll attack again.

17:54.643 --> 17:58.438
A stealth ship could have passed
our blocking easily.

17:58.473 --> 18:01.608
This Jedi chose to attack.

18:02.276 --> 18:05.195
<i>You are right, Admiral.
There are records of Trench's battles</i>

18:05.230 --> 18:07.698
<i>And a few against ships
with cloaking devices.</i>

18:07.739 --> 18:09.790
<i>- And...?
- It seems in each case</i>

18:09.825 --> 18:14.037
he used tracking torpedoes that hit the ships
somehow whether it was cloaked or not.

18:14.121 --> 18:16.123
Then he knows a way of detecting us.

18:16.164 --> 18:17.624
Tracking torpedoes.

18:18.625 --> 18:21.712
<i>- What class ship was he fighting?
- Mostly cruiser to cruiser,</i>

18:21.747 --> 18:23.338
<i>Nothing as small as your ship.</i>

18:23.380 --> 18:26.967
No ship this small usually
has a cloaking device.

18:27.009 --> 18:30.304
Maybe he's tracking
the magnetic signature.

18:30.429 --> 18:34.182
Thanks, Obi-Wan. Hold off your attack
until we destroy Trench.

18:34.266 --> 18:37.477
<i>Might I remind you
that this was not your mission?</i>

18:37.561 --> 18:39.146
You might. Admiral!

18:39.271 --> 18:42.482
Prepare to disengage
cloaking device and fire.

18:43.483 --> 18:44.860
At your stations!

18:44.902 --> 18:47.321
Engineering check.
Navigation check.

18:48.030 --> 18:50.449
- Guns check.
- Torpedoes check.

18:50.574 --> 18:51.825
Shield check.

18:51.867 --> 18:53.744
<i>Admiral, we are ready and waiting.</i>

18:53.785 --> 18:55.579
Your move, general..

18:55.621 --> 18:56.663
Fire!

19:03.921 --> 19:05.631
There she is!

19:06.298 --> 19:08.383
Recloaking in 5... 4...

19:08.800 --> 19:12.471
Sir? Four or more Republic torpedoes
armed and closing.

19:15.265 --> 19:18.268
Lock us unto that ship's
magnetic signature.

19:23.607 --> 19:25.442
Magnetic signature locked.

19:25.651 --> 19:29.738
Arm tracking torpedoes
and fire them on my command.

19:30.113 --> 19:31.281
But, sir...

19:31.323 --> 19:34.660
We cannot fire unless
we lower our shield.

19:34.701 --> 19:36.828
Lower shields and...fire!

19:37.412 --> 19:39.081
Lower shields...

19:43.919 --> 19:46.880
General, I really hope
you know what you're doing.

19:46.915 --> 19:48.340
So do I, Admiral.

19:57.140 --> 19:58.559
They are turning around.

19:58.892 --> 20:00.644
General, cloaking device is active,

20:00.686 --> 20:02.896
But they locked
unto our magnetic signature.

20:02.938 --> 20:05.107
It took the bait! Turn off
the cloaking device.

20:05.148 --> 20:07.317
Revert all power to the engines.

20:13.824 --> 20:15.617
He has headed right for us.

20:16.034 --> 20:18.370
He can't! Raise the shields!

20:18.829 --> 20:20.038
We cannot.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.374
The shields are still charging.

20:43.145 --> 20:45.606
- That's the way, yes!
- We did it!

20:47.441 --> 20:49.193
<i>I hate to admit it, but...</i>

20:49.526 --> 20:50.819
<i>Good job, Anakin.</i>

20:50.861 --> 20:53.405
We are beginning our attack
on the separatist fleet.

20:53.488 --> 20:54.531
Have fun.

20:54.740 --> 20:58.327
I'll be delivering the supplies
to the surface, master.

21:10.672 --> 21:12.216
General Skywalker!

21:12.341 --> 21:16.178
I have no idea how you did it,
but you saved a great many lives today.

21:16.637 --> 21:18.103
Good job, kid.

21:18.138 --> 21:20.933
Looks like you are now officially
part of the crew.

21:20.974 --> 21:22.476
Thanks, Commander.

21:23.810 --> 21:26.188
Well, looks like we make
a pretty good team.

21:26.223 --> 21:27.397
I must admit...

21:27.439 --> 21:31.151
I am a bit surprised at the reckless
nature of your tactics.

21:31.276 --> 21:33.862
Though I cannot argue, it had results.

21:35.447 --> 21:38.325
You'll find I like to do things...

21:38.450 --> 21:39.493
Differently.

21:39.535 --> 21:40.744
From time to time.

21:40.786 --> 21:41.870
Indeed.

21:41.995 --> 21:44.248
The chancellor mentioned as much...

21:44.456 --> 21:47.626
Though he insisted it was
the highest compliment.
