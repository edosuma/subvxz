05:26.880 --> 05:28.203
- Press play, blood.

05:29.130 --> 05:31.530
I can't promise you I'm

05:32.790 --> 05:34.082
- You don't tell nobody.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.493
This stays between them
ears and these walls.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.133
My name's Baron, by the way.

05:45.240 --> 05:48.063
Once upon a time I was just a wee boy,

05:49.038 --> 05:51.188
running through the
hay fields with my mom.

05:53.070 --> 05:54.933
Beautiful golden light.

05:57.930 --> 06:00.341
I remember the smell on the air,

06:00.341 --> 06:02.622
and the feeling of the
wind against my skin

06:02.622 --> 06:04.597
as we--
- Nah, nah, nah, hey.

06:04.597 --> 06:08.640
What the? No once upon a
time bullshit, wee boy.

07:00.781 --> 07:04.448
(upbeat lighthearted music)

07:09.960 --> 07:13.484

07:15.600 --> 07:17.663

(knocks at door)

07:21.734 --> 07:24.164

07:24.164 --> 07:25.528

07:41.550 --> 07:43.863
Oh. Bless your heart.

07:45.530 --> 07:48.720
For some it happens

07:48.720 --> 07:51.390
- Oh, my mama needs me.

07:51.390 --> 07:54.120
- You got outta look out for you too.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.883
God knows, none of us
are getting any younger.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.093
- Right.

08:00.540 --> 08:03.513
- While there's life, there's hope.

08:06.690 --> 08:09.903
- Hey, hey, pause real quick.

08:10.932 --> 08:12.434

08:14.732 --> 08:18.332
- Croquet? No ah, crochet.

08:20.038 --> 08:21.478
You know, crochet's like knittin'?

08:21.478 --> 08:24.480
- Bitch, I know what crochet

08:24.480 --> 08:25.313
Hey, look here, blood,

08:25.313 --> 08:26.970
I'm really trying to like

but you need to paint the paint better.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.280
You know what I'm saying?

08:29.280 --> 08:30.723
- I do. I think.

08:31.671 --> 08:32.700
(stamp thuds)

08:32.700 --> 08:34.440
- Day has come, Baron.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.710
I done asked you for six months
to chop that fricking Yeti

08:37.710 --> 08:39.510
off your head.

08:39.510 --> 08:41.280
Get it gone.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.250
- Mrs. Sandy, I done told
you, I've had this hair--

08:44.250 --> 08:48.570
- You are no longer working
for the postal service.

08:48.570 --> 08:52.440
Any and all involvement
is hereby nullified

08:52.440 --> 08:54.447
- But my mama, she needs
me to have this job so--

08:54.447 --> 08:57.453
- Not now. Not here.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.953
(sighs) Sweetheart, you got the job.

09:07.237 --> 09:08.670
- Hey timeout, timeout.

09:08.670 --> 09:11.370
You lost your damn job,
just 'cause you wouldn't cut

09:11.370 --> 09:12.630
your fuckin' hair?

09:12.630 --> 09:14.700
- Well, as you might've guessed,

09:14.700 --> 09:18.090
I once saw some video about
some Reggaes on some island,

09:18.090 --> 09:21.243
and their dreadlocks somehow define 'em.

09:22.323 --> 09:25.380
I don't know. I ain't ever losing my hair.

09:25.380 --> 09:29.508
- Yep. You're a regular
fuckin' Bob Marley.

09:29.508 --> 09:30.341
- Thanks.

09:32.409 --> 09:35.326

Hey, Mama. Got your moon pies.

10:24.237 --> 10:27.154

There you go.

10:32.680 --> 10:36.680
(soft TV chatter in background)

10:40.830 --> 10:43.023
They gonna raise the medicine price again.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.100
Them people's lower than a
snake's belly in a waggon rut.

10:51.387 --> 10:52.220
Open up.

10:58.887 --> 11:00.423
Now don't you worry at all.

11:06.510 --> 11:08.119
I'll find a way.

11:08.119 --> 11:11.536
(soft melancholic music)

11:16.630 --> 11:19.297

11:27.880 --> 11:31.623
Ain't no one nowhere
hiring no one nowhere.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.093
Hi, Ron.

11:37.890 --> 11:39.560
Someone once told me
that things'll get worse

11:39.560 --> 11:41.253
before they get better.

11:43.230 --> 11:47.613
But for me, life was
amountin' to a hill of beans.

11:49.072 --> 11:51.572

But, just then, outta nowhere,

12:01.857 --> 12:05.024
(relaxed blues music)

12:07.950 --> 12:09.927
red hot like fire.

12:09.927 --> 12:13.114
- [Otis] Oh shit, you like them redheads.

12:13.114 --> 12:15.120
- No, no, no, no, red hot.

12:35.373 --> 12:37.203
- Mm, I thought you were dead.

12:38.760 --> 12:39.660
- Huh?

12:39.660 --> 12:40.980
- I thought I stumbled across a dead body.

12:40.980 --> 12:42.863
Would've been the highlight of my week.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.933
- No, not dead. Don't think.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.050

12:51.750 --> 12:53.070
- Nothing.

12:53.070 --> 12:55.893
- Nothing. There ain't nothing to do?

12:56.790 --> 12:59.703
- I, I don't know. (chuckles)

13:01.463 --> 13:02.617
- Okay.

13:37.073 --> 13:40.112
Well, that's one way to do it.

13:40.112 --> 13:44.130
(Baron breathes heavily)

13:44.130 --> 13:46.110
- We got a walking trail where
you can hear the armadillos

13:46.110 --> 13:46.943
crying at night.

13:48.570 --> 13:49.980
Got an abandoned quarry
that don't feel like

13:49.980 --> 13:51.660
it have no bottom.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.993
Folks in small homes with
big dreams and no means.

13:55.860 --> 13:58.140
We got a post office run
by a mean ole boss lady

13:58.140 --> 14:01.050
with a hatred of long hairs
for no reason in particular.

14:01.050 --> 14:04.410
One red light, one ice cream
shop, lots of friendly folks.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.850
So friendly, we don't have no police,

14:05.850 --> 14:07.497
no fire department, no nothing.

14:07.497 --> 14:12.060
Uh, I don't know where you come
from, but we don't got much.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.693
I ain't got nothing, but it's home.

14:16.710 --> 14:20.173
And it's the only place I ever knowed.

14:23.079 --> 14:26.009
(Marmalade scoffs lightly)

14:26.009 --> 14:26.842
- Wow.

14:33.810 --> 14:35.633
So you gonna show me around, or what?

14:37.530 --> 14:38.363
Marmalade.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.677
That's my name, it's Marmalade.

14:43.590 --> 14:46.402
- That sounds like a name
and jelly rolled up in one.

14:46.402 --> 14:47.937
- I heard that before.

14:47.937 --> 14:48.813
- I'm Baron.

14:49.710 --> 14:51.180
- Well Baron, you look
like a freaking puppet

14:51.180 --> 14:52.080
flailing around out there.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.460
Let's get a move on before you chop down

14:53.460 --> 14:55.210
this whole damn forest.

14:55.210 --> 14:58.210
(gentle airy music)

15:00.439 --> 15:01.895
(fingers snap)

15:01.895 --> 15:02.728
You okay?

15:02.728 --> 15:04.260
- Mm-hmm.

15:04.260 --> 15:05.460
- You just feel like staring at me

15:05.460 --> 15:08.230
for an extremely awkward amount of time?

15:08.230 --> 15:10.195
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

15:10.195 --> 15:11.028
- Mm-hmm.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.250
- Well, giddy up, puppet.

15:15.075 --> 15:15.908
(car engine roars)

15:15.908 --> 15:18.270
Promise me you won't chop
off my head or nothing.

15:18.270 --> 15:24.561
♪ Glint, glint, glint ♪

15:24.561 --> 15:27.144
♪ Glint, glint ♪

15:28.320 --> 15:32.010
- I'll tell ya, from then
on we was inseparable.

15:32.010 --> 15:34.293
Like one person glued from the same cloth.

15:35.830 --> 15:39.810
♪ Glint, glint, glint, glint ♪

15:39.810 --> 15:41.197

15:41.197 --> 15:43.570

Two, three, eggplant.

15:46.794 --> 15:49.457
- I know. So how many is that?

15:49.457 --> 15:50.374
- Uh, four.

15:51.727 --> 15:55.983
- Hmm. Four outta 10. That
ain't bad, it's like half.

16:04.045 --> 16:05.939
- Mm.

16:05.939 --> 16:09.423
- You know I, I smash trees too,

16:10.620 --> 16:13.043
like you did back there, when
I was a little girl at least.

16:15.390 --> 16:16.293
Why'd you do that?

16:18.959 --> 16:22.840
- Oh, uh, it's like,
I, I can't describe it.

16:25.170 --> 16:26.433
I don't, I don't know.

16:29.310 --> 16:30.633
- Well, cheers, big ears.

16:31.710 --> 16:32.543
- Cheers.

16:32.543 --> 16:33.504
- You wanna try mine?

16:33.504 --> 16:34.337
- Sure.

16:34.337 --> 16:39.207
- Try it. (laughs loudly)

16:39.207 --> 16:41.211
Well my mom, my dear old
momsie ended up marrying

16:41.211 --> 16:43.703
some other fuckin' dickhead.

16:43.703 --> 16:48.363
(chuckles) So yeah, I
fuckin' bailed, again.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.323
Jumped freight for a minute, and then uh,

16:53.400 --> 16:55.410
then I met this sleaze bag out in Bug Bay,

16:55.410 --> 16:57.180
but he gave me Big Bertha.

16:57.180 --> 16:59.727
That's what I call her,
(hand pounds) Big B.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.769
- He just gave it to you?

17:00.769 --> 17:01.602
- Yep.

17:02.748 --> 17:03.581
- Hm.

17:03.581 --> 17:04.781
- He just gave it to me.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.286
Who knows where I'll turn up next, right?

17:07.286 --> 17:11.190
(knife clicks)
(Marmalade laughs)

17:11.190 --> 17:14.010
- Yeah, I couldn't just
up and leave my mama.

17:14.010 --> 17:16.260
- Wasn't my real mom, no.

17:16.260 --> 17:18.032
That lady's a whole other recipe.

17:19.829 --> 17:24.829
I've been in foster homes since
(sputters), fuckin' forever.

17:28.710 --> 17:29.850
- I don't tell no people this,

17:29.850 --> 17:31.353
but my daddy was an astronaut.

17:32.356 --> 17:34.440
(Marmalade chuckles)

17:34.440 --> 17:35.273
- Bullshit.

17:35.273 --> 17:36.270
- That's what my mama said.

17:36.270 --> 17:37.350
And he could never come meet me

17:37.350 --> 17:39.360
'cause he was too busy building a rocket.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.683
But, it blew up with him, in space.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.653
- Wow. (gasps)

17:56.250 --> 17:57.360
- Yeah, if not for my mama,

17:57.360 --> 17:59.220
I'd been long gone here come tomorrow.

17:59.220 --> 18:00.120
- What's her name?

18:00.990 --> 18:02.894
- Her name's Eda, Mama Eda.

18:02.894 --> 18:05.670
- Mama Eda, I like it.

18:05.670 --> 18:07.500
- She's very sick.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.272
They done raised the price
of her medicine overnight.

18:10.272 --> 18:11.105
- Mm.

18:12.780 --> 18:13.980
- Yeah, can't no one afford it,

18:13.980 --> 18:16.140
except some greedy man out there.

18:16.140 --> 18:19.864
And, and he's so, he's so rich.

18:19.864 --> 18:21.720
He, he, he just buys another boat

18:21.720 --> 18:23.133
when his first one get wet.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.260
- You know what I say, hm?

18:28.860 --> 18:30.633
I say when the system fails you,

18:33.120 --> 18:35.270
you just gotta create
your own damn system.

18:38.070 --> 18:42.003
They'll get what they're due.
Don't you worry about that.

18:44.070 --> 18:45.520
They'll get what they're due.

18:46.589 --> 18:49.839
(gentle sombre music)

18:57.310 --> 18:58.770
All right, Baron, I got
two questions for you.

18:58.770 --> 18:59.880
You can just go ahead and tell me

18:59.880 --> 19:01.943
if I'm being too forward or whatnot, okay?

19:03.210 --> 19:06.473
Question one. (clears throat)

19:07.650 --> 19:09.200
Got a place I can stay tonight?

19:14.370 --> 19:15.203
- Yeah.

19:15.203 --> 19:17.163
- (laughs) Hot damn.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.600
(Marmalade laughs)

19:21.600 --> 19:22.934
- What's the other question?

19:22.934 --> 19:23.767
- Oh, I didn't have another question.

19:23.767 --> 19:26.040
That was just sort of like a backup,

19:26.040 --> 19:28.357
in case you like, shot that one down.

19:28.357 --> 19:30.900
(car hood thuds)

19:30.900 --> 19:32.800
You wanna show me the quarry, or what?

19:35.274 --> 19:38.524
(light uplifted music)

19:42.884 --> 19:46.134
(light uplifted music)

19:48.019 --> 19:51.428
(bike clatters)

19:51.428 --> 19:52.261
Oopsies.

19:54.368 --> 19:56.180
- It's okay. I shouldn't
have left it there.

19:56.180 --> 19:57.742
(Marmalade chuckles)

19:57.742 --> 19:59.160
(knocking at door)

19:59.160 --> 19:59.993
Mama.

20:01.487 --> 20:02.320
Hey, mama.

20:03.445 --> 20:04.848
- Hi, Mama Eda.
- Oh, this is Marmalade.

20:04.848 --> 20:05.681
- I'm Marmalade.
- I'm sorry.

20:05.681 --> 20:06.604
- It's nice to meet you.

20:06.604 --> 20:08.040
- Marmalade, this is Mama Eda.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.320
- Baron's told me like a,
a shit tonne about you.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.974
I feel like I, I freaking
know you already.

20:12.974 --> 20:15.391
(Eda groans)

20:17.051 --> 20:19.468
(Eda coughs)

20:22.110 --> 20:22.943
Sorry.

20:23.820 --> 20:24.653
- [Baron] Um.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.867
(oxygen hisses)

20:31.576 --> 20:34.710
(insects buzz quietly)

20:34.710 --> 20:35.543
- Well, I'm tired, so--

20:35.543 --> 20:36.376
- Right, yeah.

20:36.376 --> 20:38.377
I'll just leave you, leave you be.

20:38.377 --> 20:40.413
Oh, Marmalade, ah, hey.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.940
You gonna head out first thing tomorrow?

20:44.880 --> 20:46.350
- It depends.

20:46.350 --> 20:48.153
Maybe if that job don't work out,

20:49.110 --> 20:50.643
come up with another plan.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.250
You know, for you and me,
and Mama Eda, of course.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.363
- Yeah, I'd like that.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.280
- Goodnight, puppet.

21:04.215 --> 21:05.573
- Right.

21:05.573 --> 21:06.406
Night.

21:07.340 --> 21:12.340

21:48.773 --> 21:52.190

21:53.128 --> 21:53.961
- Hello?

21:54.824 --> 21:55.657
Hi.
- Oh, hey.

21:58.230 --> 21:59.230
- You're still here.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.800
You're in my--

22:01.800 --> 22:02.633
- Yeah.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.018
I found it in your room.

22:05.018 --> 22:06.330

22:06.330 --> 22:07.307
- Let, let me show you--
- All right.

22:07.307 --> 22:08.640
- How to do a...

22:11.760 --> 22:13.200
Hi, Mama.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.030
- Hey, what are those?

22:15.030 --> 22:16.953
- Oh my god. Almost forgot.

22:17.790 --> 22:18.623
For you.

22:18.623 --> 22:21.189
- Puppet, really? Oh my god, thank you.

22:21.189 --> 22:22.232
- Careful, careful.

22:22.232 --> 22:24.026
(medical machine beeps)

22:24.026 --> 22:26.520
- Wow, I never got flowers before.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.350
- Don't they smell beautiful?

22:28.350 --> 22:29.730
- I can't smell.

22:29.730 --> 22:31.920
- No, not, not that big
one, the little small ones.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.710
- No, I mean like, I can't smell nothing.

22:34.710 --> 22:36.990
Never could, congenital anosmia.

22:36.990 --> 22:38.540
It's some random-ass rare shit.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.940
- Well, you can borrow my nose.

22:41.940 --> 22:44.553
They smell beautiful, just like you.

No, I just gotta find something

were the only things

26:25.920 --> 26:28.290
keeping mama alive.

26:28.290 --> 26:30.527
But to get 'em, well
we didn't know nothing

26:30.527 --> 26:34.560
'bout robbing a bank, so Marmalade
done come up with a list.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.393
- [Marmalade] Number one, stake out.

26:39.507 --> 26:41.610
- Now warts backwards is straw.

26:41.610 --> 26:43.200
Dog is God.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.830
Reward is uh, well, reward is drawer.

26:46.830 --> 26:48.180
- It's too damn exposed.

26:48.180 --> 26:49.160
- What?

26:49.160 --> 26:50.220
- There's fuckin' foot traffic everywhere.

26:50.220 --> 26:51.520
It ain't never gonna work.

26:53.673 --> 26:55.170
- Oh.

26:55.170 --> 26:57.335
Oh, I didn't know we was
scoutin' starting right now.

26:57.335 --> 26:59.823
- Sh. Puppet.

27:01.110 --> 27:03.030
We gotta take this fuckin' serious.

27:03.030 --> 27:04.049
- Mm-hmm.

27:04.049 --> 27:07.713
- All right, I wanna start my
dream life. Our dream life.

27:14.820 --> 27:16.140
- There's a bank a few towns over.

27:16.140 --> 27:17.503
It's been there since I can remember.

27:17.503 --> 27:22.503
(engine revs)
(tyres squeal)

27:23.216 --> 27:26.216
(adventurous music)

27:29.160 --> 27:31.157
- Number two, case the joint.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.213
(chuckles) Baby, it's perfect.

27:37.080 --> 27:37.913
- You reckon?

27:37.913 --> 27:41.442
- I reckon. I reckon, I
reckon, I reckon, I reckon.

27:41.442 --> 27:44.873
(laughs) Come on!

27:44.873 --> 27:45.706
- Right now?

27:45.706 --> 27:48.263
- No, we're not gonna do it
now. We're not fucktards.

27:48.263 --> 27:49.096
- Okay.

27:49.096 --> 27:50.940
- Now, you gotta count the cameras,

27:50.940 --> 27:54.030
how high the teller windows
are, number of clerks,

27:54.030 --> 27:56.222
the entrances, the exits--
- The number of clerks?

27:56.222 --> 27:57.300
What do you mean?

27:57.300 --> 27:59.100
- Oh, just stay natural, puppet.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.693
I got a feeling about this one.

28:02.733 --> 28:03.965
- Oh, god-dang-it.

28:03.965 --> 28:04.798
- Okay, first off--
- Baby, I should go--

28:04.798 --> 28:05.700
- Oh!
- Oh, my pop.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.147
- Mm, puppet.
- It's all a mess.

28:07.147 --> 28:07.980
- [Marmalade] Okay, it's
fine, it's fine, it's fine,

28:07.980 --> 28:08.813
it's fine, it's fine, puppet, it's fine.

28:08.813 --> 28:09.810
- [Baron] Sorry.

28:09.810 --> 28:10.997
- [Marmalade] Focus. So
I'm gonna walk in here.

28:10.997 --> 28:12.122
You're gonna be standing
right here on the X.

28:12.122 --> 28:12.955
- [Baron] Okay, I'm on the X.

28:12.955 --> 28:13.995
- [Marmalade] I'm gonna
go up to the teller.

28:13.995 --> 28:14.828
- [Baron] Yes.

28:14.828 --> 28:15.661
- [Marmalade] I'm gonna ask
for the money in the safe.

28:15.661 --> 28:16.494
We're gonna--
- And this is the safe,

28:16.494 --> 28:17.327
right there.
- Yes, that's the safe.

28:17.327 --> 28:18.600
- Okay.
- You shoot the camera,

28:18.600 --> 28:19.530
and then we out.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.150
Wham bam, thank you ma'am.

28:21.150 --> 28:24.243
- [Baron] Shoot? Shoot, shoot
the camera with, with what?

28:25.285 --> 28:26.699
(gun thuds)

28:26.699 --> 28:27.532
Uh.

28:28.380 --> 28:30.183
- Number three, weapons training.

28:31.469 --> 28:33.842
(cans and bottles clink)

28:33.842 --> 28:36.642
(Marmalade imitates gun firing)

28:36.642 --> 28:37.812
(Marmalade laughs)

28:37.812 --> 28:40.230
Bam.

28:40.230 --> 28:41.490
Can we focus now, please?

28:41.490 --> 28:42.323
- Yeah, I'm sorry,

28:42.323 --> 28:44.340
I just ain't never used
no type of firearm before.

28:44.340 --> 28:46.540
- What do I look like,
some fucking gun nut?

28:48.450 --> 28:51.213
Hey, don't answer that.

28:54.780 --> 28:58.903
Just aim, when you think
you're lined up, boom, fire.

28:59.882 --> 29:00.715
- Okay.

29:01.790 --> 29:04.312
- Here you go. Bear right there.

29:04.312 --> 29:09.312
(gunshot blasts)
(Marmalade laughs)

29:13.432 --> 29:17.415
(gunshots blast)
(glass shatters)

29:17.415 --> 29:22.415
(Marmalade laughs and
screeches indistinctly)

29:23.063 --> 29:23.896
(Baron cries out)

29:23.896 --> 29:26.550
Number four, team bonding.

29:26.550 --> 29:27.900
- Y'all need help?

29:27.900 --> 29:30.783
- Yep. Where're your
changing rooms at, sugar.

29:31.635 --> 29:34.968
(slow blues rock music)

29:42.315 --> 29:46.482
(slow blues rock music continues)

29:59.503 --> 30:02.729
(lamp clatters)

30:02.729 --> 30:05.646
(Marmalade moans)

30:08.477 --> 30:12.240
- I love you, and I always will. (moans)

30:16.881 --> 30:21.337
- Yo! Shit, I got it. Damn.

30:21.337 --> 30:23.430
I'm trying to be down with
your details and shit, blood.

30:23.430 --> 30:25.893
But like, you making
this hella uncomfortable.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.080
Hand me that poop paper.

30:30.570 --> 30:33.900
- Well anyway, Marmalade had tattoos

30:33.900 --> 30:36.420
on all sorts of nooks and crannies.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.850
Places I ain't ever
seen before. (chuckles)

30:38.850 --> 30:41.070
She used to call me her blank canvas.

30:41.070 --> 30:41.903
- Keep talking.

30:41.903 --> 30:44.662
- Well, then, Marmalade
got a heart tattoo.

30:44.662 --> 30:45.990
- [Marmalade] (laughs) I love
it, I love it, I love it.

30:45.990 --> 30:47.790
- [Baron] With the name Baron on it.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.756
But, for mine--

30:50.756 --> 30:55.260
- No. No, no, no, you
fucking idiot. It's M-A-R-M.

30:55.260 --> 30:58.080
- That idiot done spelled Marmalade wrong,

30:58.080 --> 31:00.300
so we had him stop.

31:00.300 --> 31:02.340
Just in the nick of time too.

31:02.340 --> 31:05.250
He had an M and an A and an M.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.830
All he had to do is add a little extra A.

31:07.830 --> 31:09.900
Forever I'll have it
to think about my mama.

31:09.900 --> 31:10.733
It's perfect.

31:12.150 --> 31:15.600
- Hey, Marmalade got a lotta ink?

31:15.600 --> 31:16.893
- Bunch of little ones.

31:18.690 --> 31:21.453
Man, she does have this
puzzle piece on her neck.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.150
- Puzzle piece?

31:24.150 --> 31:25.700
All right, what's up with that?

31:27.000 --> 31:30.360
- Well that's like, like a, like a piece

31:30.360 --> 31:32.790
that you find when you're
looking for a puzzle.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.530
And there's all these individuals--

31:34.530 --> 31:37.140
- I know what the fuck puzzle
piece is, I got a granddaddy.

31:37.140 --> 31:40.350
I was just, I'm saying like, is it like,

31:40.350 --> 31:41.670
like is it big on her neck?

31:41.670 --> 31:42.503
It's big?

31:42.503 --> 31:43.336
- Yeah. Why?

31:43.336 --> 31:46.320
- Why? You the one said
it's all about the details.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.420
Got me over here feeling shit.
You know what I'm saying?

31:48.420 --> 31:51.660
I'm inspired, motherfucker.
Quench my thirst.

31:51.660 --> 31:52.493
Come on, blood.

31:53.446 --> 31:56.863
(gentle seductive music)

31:59.056 --> 32:00.987
(Gary clears throat)

32:00.987 --> 32:03.780
(Marmalade giggles)

32:03.780 --> 32:04.613
- Oh, excuse me.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.853
What's this? I gave you a 20.

32:09.690 --> 32:12.360
- Uh, don't think so,
doll. Y'all gave me a 10.

32:15.168 --> 32:17.010
- Puppet, didn't I give him a 20?

32:17.010 --> 32:19.893
- Marmalade had her own set
of rules for everything.

32:21.150 --> 32:23.220
- Yeah, Gary, that was a 20.

32:23.220 --> 32:24.693
Sorry, I, I done seen that.

32:27.630 --> 32:29.730
- Skipped my third cup of
jitter juice this morning.

32:29.730 --> 32:30.563
- [Baron] Oh.

32:30.563 --> 32:31.590
- [Gary] Sorry about that, Baron.

32:31.590 --> 32:32.593
- It's all right.

32:32.593 --> 32:34.440
(cash register keys beep)

32:34.440 --> 32:35.273
Thank you.

32:37.697 --> 32:38.530
(coins jingle)

32:38.530 --> 32:39.600
Ready, puppet?
- Yep.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.220
Thanks, Gary.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.813
- Send my best to Eda now, boy.

32:44.100 --> 32:44.933
- Mama.

32:46.702 --> 32:50.403
(moon pie wrapper crumples)

32:50.403 --> 32:52.095
(car door bangs shut)

32:52.095 --> 32:54.833
(slow sombre music)

32:54.833 --> 32:58.533
I'm sorry, Mama. It's
just uh, me and Marmalade.

32:59.847 --> 33:03.240
Uh, yeah, you know.

33:06.062 --> 33:09.693
We've been working on some big plans, yep.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.643
Yeah, she done figured a way out.

33:12.643 --> 33:14.657
(Eda groans softly)

33:14.657 --> 33:16.653
(sighs) Yeah, truth be told,

33:18.243 --> 33:20.003
I don't know what the heck I'm doing.

33:22.890 --> 33:27.890
Well she wants to, uh, she
wants to rob a dang bank.

33:28.230 --> 33:29.220
(Eda groans softly)

33:29.220 --> 33:30.053
I know.

33:30.900 --> 33:33.843
And you know, I just,
well the pills, and she's,

33:34.860 --> 33:35.693
she wants to,

33:39.450 --> 33:40.300
think I love her.

33:43.380 --> 33:44.790
And you see, I don't wanna let her down.

33:44.790 --> 33:48.083
It's just, I am scared, Mama.

33:51.216 --> 33:52.049
Mama.

33:57.937 --> 33:58.770
Mama?

34:03.610 --> 34:04.443
Mama?

34:07.770 --> 34:10.331
(Eda gasps and coughs violently)

34:10.331 --> 34:11.895
It's all right.

34:11.895 --> 34:13.228
It's okay. Okay.

34:14.344 --> 34:17.594
(Eda gasps and coughs)

34:22.282 --> 34:25.032
All right, don't you worry, Mama.

34:28.373 --> 34:30.023
We're gonna make this work, okay?

34:31.467 --> 34:33.110
I promise.

34:33.110 --> 34:35.346
(Eda cries softly)

34:35.346 --> 34:36.179
I promise.

34:39.409 --> 34:42.577
(gentle sombre music)

34:48.837 --> 34:52.837
(gentle sombre music continues)

34:59.359 --> 35:03.359
(gentle sombre music continues)

35:08.706 --> 35:12.706
(gentle sombre music continues)

35:19.986 --> 35:23.986
(gentle sombre music continues)

35:28.312 --> 35:30.521
(birds chirp)

35:30.521 --> 35:33.688
(Baron moans lightly)

35:34.843 --> 35:37.760
(soft scary music)

35:39.888 --> 35:44.427
(Baron gasps)
(Marmalade laughs)

35:44.427 --> 35:47.193
- Oh my god. You almost shit yourself.

35:48.360 --> 35:49.890
Wait, did you actually shit yourself?

35:49.890 --> 35:51.273
- Oh, why'd you do that?

35:52.110 --> 35:53.190
- Early worm catches the bird.

35:53.190 --> 35:54.563
You gotta plan, plan, plan,
plan, plan, plan, plan. Come on.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.914
- Hey, you seen Mama's pills?

35:57.914 --> 35:59.160
(car engine races)

35:59.160 --> 36:02.310
Hey, what happened to your
mama? Your birth mama?

36:02.310 --> 36:05.280
You said, you said you
were in fosters care.

36:05.280 --> 36:08.045
- It's foster care, not fosters.

36:08.045 --> 36:09.960
- [Baron] Oh, foster care.

36:09.960 --> 36:13.293
Okay so, what happened, Marmalade?

36:14.250 --> 36:16.290
- Number five, safe house.

36:16.290 --> 36:17.760
Just quit asking me about it, all right?

36:17.760 --> 36:19.260
- Why can't you just tell me?

36:19.260 --> 36:20.550
- It, it was nothing, all right?

36:20.550 --> 36:22.513
My momma just didn't come save me is all.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.323
Fuckin' fried outta her damn skull.

36:24.323 --> 36:25.240
- Save you?

36:27.141 --> 36:29.223
What you mean, "Save you?"

36:29.223 --> 36:30.181
Marmalade.

36:30.181 --> 36:31.973
- From one of my fuckin'
foster dads, okay?

36:33.870 --> 36:34.703
Happy?

36:37.176 --> 36:39.513
(glass shatters)

36:39.513 --> 36:40.383
- What'd he do?

36:40.383 --> 36:44.367
- (sighs heavily) You don't wanna know.

36:44.367 --> 36:46.073
- [Baron] I do wanna know. I, I--

36:46.073 --> 36:47.573
- [Marmalade] I don't wanna talk about it.

36:47.573 --> 36:48.533
- [Baron] Why not?

36:48.533 --> 36:49.657
- [Marmalade] 'Cause I just
don't wanna talk about it.

36:49.657 --> 36:50.630
- [Baron] Why not?

36:50.630 --> 36:51.920
- Fuck!

36:51.920 --> 36:52.913
(car engine revs)

36:52.913 --> 36:55.530
My life ain't like yours, all right.

36:55.530 --> 36:56.463
You don't wanna know what
the fuck I've been through.

36:56.463 --> 36:58.410
- I wanna know, I do.
- No you don't.

36:58.410 --> 36:59.535
- Yes.
- You really don't.

36:59.535 --> 37:00.535
- Like what?

37:01.755 --> 37:04.672
(soft tense music)

37:17.735 --> 37:18.568
- Like...

37:20.156 --> 37:23.323
(soft haunting music)

37:26.211 --> 37:28.276
(Marmalade sniffles)

37:28.276 --> 37:33.276
Like someone who hobbles into
your fuckin' room every night.

37:36.778 --> 37:40.195
We were (clears throat),

37:42.169 --> 37:44.885
we were just little kids, you know.

37:44.885 --> 37:48.052
(soft haunting music)

37:52.900 --> 37:54.983
We were just little kids.

37:55.890 --> 37:57.490
And after he done with all that,

37:58.410 --> 37:59.956
he takes you out to the fuckin' garage

37:59.956 --> 38:02.539
and he locks you in a dog cage.

38:04.049 --> 38:09.049
Fuckin' dog cages. (cries)

38:10.437 --> 38:14.733
And he jabs at you with his
stupid little white cane.

38:16.650 --> 38:20.670
His left eye twitching,
when you get him mad.

38:20.670 --> 38:23.010
I should've took his cane
and killed that fat fuck

38:23.010 --> 38:24.243
when I had the chance.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.321
(soft tense music)

38:33.330 --> 38:35.680
And hell, I heard he
still fosters little kids.

38:41.258 --> 38:42.480
(Marmalade sniffles)

38:42.480 --> 38:44.610
Probably still got cages
out in the back garage.

38:44.610 --> 38:46.510
You don't wanna know about this stuff.

38:49.836 --> 38:50.669
Oh.

38:55.717 --> 38:59.493
- Well, I'm your knight in
shining armour. Remember that?

39:02.483 --> 39:04.170
(Marmalade laughs)

39:04.170 --> 39:05.298
Remember that?

39:05.298 --> 39:06.881
- Yeah, I do. I do.

39:09.607 --> 39:12.793
Mm, yeah, that's right. (laughs)

39:15.660 --> 39:19.290
But for right now, it's
time we make our own rules.

39:19.290 --> 39:20.695
- Yeah.
- Hm?

39:20.695 --> 39:23.695
(Marmalade giggles)

39:24.925 --> 39:26.430
(both moan)

39:26.430 --> 39:27.263
All right.

39:29.370 --> 39:30.203
- Love you too.

39:32.491 --> 39:33.900
- You comin'?

39:33.900 --> 39:36.153
- Yeah. Oh, geez.

39:37.033 --> 39:37.866
(door slams shut)

39:37.866 --> 39:40.353
- [Marmalade] Number six, disguises.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.328
- [Baron] Marmalade?

39:43.328 --> 39:45.060
(Marmalade laughs)

39:45.060 --> 39:47.940
- So we gotta think about
our disguises a tonne

39:47.940 --> 39:50.700
because with our notoriety,
we'll be known forever

39:50.700 --> 39:53.040
by whatever bullshit
name they come up with.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.960
- That, who's they?

39:54.960 --> 39:56.250
- You just gotta make a statement

39:56.250 --> 40:00.163
but not be too fuckin' stupid. (laughs)

40:01.800 --> 40:03.686
- Uh, what about this?

40:03.686 --> 40:07.080
We could be the uh, we
could be the rooster gang,

40:07.080 --> 40:09.240
something like that.
- Mm.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.680
Nah, they'd probably just call us

40:10.680 --> 40:12.060
the giant fucking cock gang.

40:12.060 --> 40:13.760
I bet you'd like that though, huh?

40:14.680 --> 40:16.260
(Marmalade gasps)

40:16.260 --> 40:18.300
Puppet looky. Looky, looky, looky, looky.

40:18.300 --> 40:19.150
Help me, help me.

40:21.546 --> 40:22.379
Oh. Here.

40:23.563 --> 40:25.070
- Oh, it's...

40:27.330 --> 40:29.103
- What's better than one Marmalade?

40:31.376 --> 40:33.206
Three Marmalades.

40:33.206 --> 40:36.123
(soft eerie music)

40:37.820 --> 40:40.053
- I, I don't think we can afford these.

40:41.116 --> 40:44.283
(soft haunting music)

40:45.270 --> 40:46.103
- Put it on.

40:48.253 --> 40:51.506
Come on, put it on. Try it on.

40:51.506 --> 40:56.333
Oh.

40:56.333 --> 40:59.707
(Marmalade chuckles)

40:59.707 --> 41:01.650
You know, you and me,
we've been kicked around

41:01.650 --> 41:02.603
our whole lives.

41:04.537 --> 41:07.042
It's time we start kicking back.

41:07.042 --> 41:10.209
(intense eerie music)

41:24.713 --> 41:26.612
(clerk gasps)

41:26.612 --> 41:28.112
Get on the ground.

41:29.416 --> 41:31.178
Come on, get on the ground.

41:31.178 --> 41:33.263
Get on the fucking ground!

41:33.263 --> 41:35.039
(gun whacks)

41:35.039 --> 41:37.439
(Marmalade gasps)

41:37.439 --> 41:39.359
(cash register beeps)

41:39.359 --> 41:41.775
(tense scary music)

41:41.775 --> 41:45.757
Fuck. Let's split, Puppet.
Let's go. Fuckin' split.

41:45.757 --> 41:47.319
Let's go, split.

41:47.319 --> 41:50.319
(tense eerie music)

41:59.286 --> 42:04.244
(car engine revs)
(tyres squeal)

42:04.244 --> 42:07.744
(tense adventurous music)

42:14.764 --> 42:17.347
(tyres squeal)

42:18.371 --> 42:21.621
(birds chirp)

42:21.621 --> 42:22.454
(Baron breathes heavily)

42:22.454 --> 42:23.287
Hey?

42:25.313 --> 42:27.880
Hey, baby, I was just playing.

42:29.160 --> 42:32.073
Look at me. It's just me.

42:34.770 --> 42:37.110
That kid just got a little boo-boo, okay?

42:37.110 --> 42:38.193
Stupid little dummy.

42:39.690 --> 42:42.443
Just being stupid funny to get
the jitters out for tomorrow.

42:44.910 --> 42:45.743
- Tomorrow?

42:47.010 --> 42:47.843
- D-Day?

42:50.790 --> 42:52.000
- I, I, I think I got some
baseball card collection

42:54.090 --> 42:54.923
we could sell, we can't--

42:54.923 --> 42:56.502
- She's gonna fuckin' die, Baron.

42:59.610 --> 43:00.443
She's gonna fuckin' die.

43:00.443 --> 43:01.276
- Don't say that.

43:03.224 --> 43:04.057
- Look,

43:06.300 --> 43:08.187
this will be our last job.

43:08.187 --> 43:09.633
(smacks lips) I swear.

43:11.250 --> 43:12.866
- We haven't even had our first job yet.

43:12.866 --> 43:16.950
- (giggles) Just gotta go tomorrow, okay?

43:16.950 --> 43:19.310
Some things you just gotta trust me on.

43:19.310 --> 43:21.977
(insects chirp)

43:25.950 --> 43:27.963
Number seven, bank note.

43:28.830 --> 43:33.830
Masks, put on our faces.
Notes, hide our voices.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.750
- But you done spelled money wrong.

43:41.074 --> 43:43.800
- What? Yeah, I know.
Misspelling'll throw 'em off.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.803
You could leave it as like a calling card.

43:49.890 --> 43:50.740
What do you want?

43:53.536 --> 43:54.369
Hm?

43:55.391 --> 43:56.640
- Hm?

43:56.640 --> 43:58.440
- I mean, we got all the
opportunity in the world.

43:58.440 --> 43:59.893
So, what do you want?

44:00.878 --> 44:02.228
- Well, I want Mama to get better.

44:02.228 --> 44:04.740
- No, puppet. What do you want, huh?

44:04.740 --> 44:06.363
What do you, Baron, need?

44:08.340 --> 44:09.892
- Oh you, I want you.

44:09.892 --> 44:11.929
(Marmalade giggles)
I need you.

44:11.929 --> 44:12.762
- Hm.

44:13.753 --> 44:15.033
I want you too.

44:17.110 --> 44:19.263
I want this. I want us.

44:24.209 --> 44:26.292
But this is the only way.

44:28.507 --> 44:31.042
And we gotta do this.

44:31.042 --> 44:34.209
(soft haunting music)

44:40.425 --> 44:44.425
(soft haunting music continues)

44:49.117 --> 44:53.284
(soft haunting music intensifies)

44:59.526 --> 45:02.943
(intense haunting music)

45:07.804 --> 45:11.221
(intense haunting music)

45:19.466 --> 45:22.883
(intense haunting music)

45:28.078 --> 45:30.291
(Eda coughs)

45:30.291 --> 45:31.124
- I gotta go check on Mama.

45:31.124 --> 45:32.563
- No, she's fine. She's fine, baby.

45:32.563 --> 45:33.750
- I gotta go rub her feet, okay?

45:33.750 --> 45:35.330
- I can do it. All right?

45:36.291 --> 45:37.673
- All right.
- I can do it.

45:39.300 --> 45:41.313
She's just as much my mama now too.

45:42.997 --> 45:47.700
(footsteps clomp)
(Eda coughs)

45:47.700 --> 45:50.703
- Sometimes I ask God
how come people get sick?

45:53.130 --> 45:55.500
Some of 'em just get better and better,

45:55.500 --> 45:57.723
but some of 'em just get worse and worse.

45:59.660 --> 46:04.660
If'n he creates all good, then
he gotta create all evil too.

46:04.890 --> 46:07.014
Sure makes you wonder
how far we all gotta go

46:07.014 --> 46:08.733
for the ones we love.

46:10.980 --> 46:13.270
Especially when things go all twisted.

46:15.456 --> 46:18.373
While there is life, there is hope.

46:19.938 --> 46:21.061
(Marmalade screams)

46:21.061 --> 46:22.564
- [Marmalade] Oh my god, fuck.

46:22.564 --> 46:23.593
- What happened.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

46:23.593 --> 46:24.687
fuck, I don't know.
- What happened?

46:24.687 --> 46:25.573
- [Marmalade] I don't know, I just fucking

46:25.573 --> 46:26.703
went to the kitchen and I came back

46:26.703 --> 46:28.807
and she just fucking laying
there looking like this.

46:28.807 --> 46:29.810
- What happened?

46:29.810 --> 46:32.866
- I don't know, puppet. I wasn't in here.

46:32.866 --> 46:36.403
What's wrong with her?
Fuck, is she dead, puppet?

46:36.403 --> 46:39.561
What's wrong with her? (cries)
I don't wanna look at her.

46:39.561 --> 46:43.061
(medical equipment beeps)

46:45.768 --> 46:49.435
(medical machine flatlines)

46:51.303 --> 46:54.636
(grass rustles lightly)

47:01.456 --> 47:04.539
(wind whips lightly)

47:09.528 --> 47:12.611
(wind whips lightly)

47:16.259 --> 47:18.176
- [Otis] You all right?

47:23.474 --> 47:27.807
- They just kept raising
the price of that medicine.

47:34.522 --> 47:36.567
(Baron sniffles)

47:36.567 --> 47:38.027
- Hey look here, blood.

47:39.708 --> 47:42.250
I know it uh, don't help much,

47:43.410 --> 47:46.413
but my mom's been sick my whole life.

47:49.830 --> 47:51.780
I don't even know if she's still alive.

47:53.130 --> 47:54.273
- You don't talk?

47:55.974 --> 48:00.163
- No, she in Kingston, Jamaica,
that's where she grew up.

48:01.671 --> 48:03.273
And uh, we uh,

48:06.390 --> 48:09.933
we, our shit's complicated, blood.

48:15.684 --> 48:18.184
- That's the only mom you got.

48:19.950 --> 48:21.200
Only one you'll ever get.

48:22.874 --> 48:24.690
(stick clangs on cell bars)

48:24.690 --> 48:26.070
- [Guard] Give them great meals

48:26.070 --> 48:29.550
and they will eat like
wolves and fight like devils.

48:29.550 --> 48:31.530
- All right, look, I
can get shit straight,

48:31.530 --> 48:32.415
but you need go at tell--

48:32.415 --> 48:34.417
- I ain't even tell the
whole story yet though.

48:34.417 --> 48:36.715
- Hey fool, we ain't got much time.

48:36.715 --> 48:38.100
(cell door bangs)

48:38.100 --> 48:41.883
- We are time's subjects,
and time bids us begone.

48:46.530 --> 48:49.560
Shakespeare sermonising, hosted
by yours truly every Friday

48:49.560 --> 48:51.210
during rec if you're so inclined.

48:53.629 --> 48:55.230
(stick bangs on cell bars)

48:55.230 --> 48:57.210
- Hey, sit your ass, hey, hey.

48:58.456 --> 49:00.300
All right, look here, it's chow time.

49:00.300 --> 49:01.710
You gonna go out there and eat your slop,

49:01.710 --> 49:03.347
but what you not gonna do is
cry on these motherfuckers

49:03.347 --> 49:04.983
like a little bitch, all right?

49:06.900 --> 49:08.200
Cripple your ass for real.

49:09.439 --> 49:10.863
Here, take that, take that.

49:18.359 --> 49:19.192
(Otis sniffles)

49:19.192 --> 49:20.781
All right. (sniffles)

49:20.781 --> 49:23.760
(clears throat) Head up. Walk tall.

49:23.760 --> 49:26.073
You know what I'm saying?
Chest out. Come on.

49:27.060 --> 49:28.466
Clinch your butt cheeks.

49:28.466 --> 49:33.466
(deep tense music)
(inmates chatter quietly)

49:37.871 --> 49:42.871
(deep tense music)
(inmates chatter quietly)

49:43.816 --> 49:46.316
(tray clinks)

49:50.684 --> 49:52.543
(food swipes)

49:52.543 --> 49:53.833
(tray clinks)

49:53.833 --> 49:56.250
(face thuds)

49:57.150 --> 49:59.650
(fork clinks)

50:05.160 --> 50:08.077
(soft tense music)

50:11.909 --> 50:14.202
- I think you got something in your braid.

50:14.202 --> 50:17.199
(soft boom)

50:17.199 --> 50:20.616
(inmate grumbles softly)

50:25.829 --> 50:30.829
(adventurous music)
(inmates yell)

50:32.682 --> 50:35.415
- Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.

50:35.415 --> 50:36.248
Come on, get up.

50:36.248 --> 50:37.312
Behind your back.
- What? What? What?

50:37.312 --> 50:40.852
(alarm blares)
(guards speak indistinctly)

50:40.852 --> 50:42.800
- Oh man, you gonna try
and do somethin'? Huh, huh?

50:42.800 --> 50:43.633
- Let's go.

50:43.633 --> 50:48.120
(Otis and guards drown
out by alarm blaring)

50:48.120 --> 50:50.234
(cell door lock clicks)

50:50.234 --> 50:52.234
- Get your ass in there.

50:54.455 --> 50:57.666
(cell door bangs shut)

50:57.666 --> 50:59.999
Well? What are you gonna do?

51:01.084 --> 51:04.814
(soft tense music)

51:04.814 --> 51:07.647
(handcuffs click)

51:13.980 --> 51:16.410
Whoo. Sorry about that, boss.

51:16.410 --> 51:18.990
- I'm guessing the guy with
the tattoos isn't with us?

51:18.990 --> 51:20.954
- No, he's not one of ours.

51:20.954 --> 51:21.960
He's a great look though, huh?

51:21.960 --> 51:23.670
- Special agent?
- Yeah.

51:23.670 --> 51:24.930
- Detective Grey.

51:24.930 --> 51:27.750
Local. Solid. Solid work.

51:27.750 --> 51:29.490
Think we might have a bit of a problem.

51:29.490 --> 51:31.440
- Wait, what? What problem?

51:31.440 --> 51:33.570
- Between you and me, I think
you left your idiots guide

51:33.570 --> 51:35.497
to Ebonics up there. (laughs)

51:35.497 --> 51:36.360
"What up, blood?"

51:36.360 --> 51:39.090
I mean, I don't think
I've heard that ever.

51:39.090 --> 51:40.490
- Are you serious right now?

51:41.915 --> 51:44.070
- That didn't come out
quite like I wanted it to.

51:44.070 --> 51:46.233
Um, the team's over here.

51:48.823 --> 51:49.656
- Hey. Hey.
(agents clap)

51:49.656 --> 51:51.330
- Is everyone up to speed?

51:51.330 --> 51:53.970
We just, thank you.

51:53.970 --> 51:56.460
All right, there's not much
time left. I need a re-patch.

51:56.460 --> 51:58.320
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

51:58.320 --> 52:01.473
- We think you've been
pushing him a little too far.

52:02.490 --> 52:03.990
We're gonna take it from here.

52:05.103 --> 52:07.170
- I'm, I'm sorry. You are?

52:07.170 --> 52:09.204
- Chief Aldo Dixon.

52:09.204 --> 52:10.410
- All right, well look here, Chief.

52:10.410 --> 52:12.390
This Marmalade is my Bug Bay Bandit.

52:12.390 --> 52:13.833
- In my jurisdiction.

52:15.450 --> 52:20.130
I almost had him singing about
his little gal pal before.

52:20.130 --> 52:22.680
And I wasn't even playing dress up.

52:22.680 --> 52:24.270
- Chief, all due respect,

52:24.270 --> 52:25.800
I've been chasing her for two years.

52:25.800 --> 52:28.650
- You don't even know
it's the same broad yet.

52:28.650 --> 52:29.543
- For real? Okay.

52:31.440 --> 52:34.890
Bug Bay Bandit, also known
as the Baby Doll Bandit.

52:34.890 --> 52:37.410
Multiple robberies, all with the same MO.

52:37.410 --> 52:40.140
See, she wears the same
pink baby doll dress.

52:40.140 --> 52:43.590
Look. Same handwriting, same
misspellings, all right?

52:43.590 --> 52:45.750
Zero trace. This is the only lead we have.

52:45.750 --> 52:47.730
- I'm taking him back
down for questioning.

52:47.730 --> 52:49.233
- Sir, please don't do that.

52:50.310 --> 52:51.900
- Excuse me?

52:51.900 --> 52:54.000
- All due respect, you've been listening.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.070
Any alarms before that meet,

52:56.070 --> 52:57.180
she disappears all over again.

52:57.180 --> 52:58.830
- Exactly right.

52:58.830 --> 53:01.170
- Sir, you're never gonna believe this.

53:01.170 --> 53:02.730
He's asking for a phone call.

53:02.730 --> 53:04.080
- We can trace that.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.370
- Absolutely not.

53:05.370 --> 53:06.420
- I already wired it, sir.

53:06.420 --> 53:07.320
- Then, fuck!

53:07.320 --> 53:09.092
- [Digital Voice] Leave
a message after the beep.

53:09.092 --> 53:09.925
(voicemail beeps)

53:09.925 --> 53:11.553
- Hello? Marmalade?

53:18.319 --> 53:20.010
I don't know if you're gonna hear this,

53:20.010 --> 53:21.617
but they done got me.

53:21.617 --> 53:24.297
But don't you worry, I'm coming.

53:24.297 --> 53:27.047
This nice man in here is gonna...

53:28.604 --> 53:32.460
You, you just gotta meet me at our spot.

53:32.460 --> 53:35.163
3:30, like you done said. Okay?

53:37.530 --> 53:39.330
Can't wait to see you again.

53:40.987 --> 53:43.387
I'll take good care of you. I promise you.

53:49.880 --> 53:51.797
It's Baron, by the way.

53:53.364 --> 53:55.833
(phone receiver clicks)

53:55.833 --> 53:57.510
- [Dixon] You ain't
taking him outta my jail.

53:57.510 --> 54:01.170
- Look, he shows us the way,
we come right back here again.

54:01.170 --> 54:04.230
- There ain't no way
that she is gonna show.

54:04.230 --> 54:05.520
- It's the only chance we got.

54:05.520 --> 54:07.170
- Governor might allow a partial pardon.

54:07.170 --> 54:08.003
- No time.

54:09.330 --> 54:13.710
- That boy is dumber
than a box of crayons.

54:13.710 --> 54:16.203
Now there ain't no way
that he is gonna break,

54:17.850 --> 54:18.723
unless, well,

54:21.840 --> 54:23.253
someone makes him break.

54:25.525 --> 54:26.358
Mm.

54:27.858 --> 54:30.086
(chuckles) Yeah.

54:30.086 --> 54:30.919
(both laugh)

54:30.919 --> 54:31.752
Yeah.

54:31.752 --> 54:32.833
- All right.
- Yeah.

54:32.833 --> 54:34.650
- All right. I'm going back in.

54:34.650 --> 54:36.030
He doesn't talk, you know what to do.

54:36.030 --> 54:37.320
We're going Jack Rabbit parole.

54:37.320 --> 54:38.670
Fill Detective Grey in here.

54:38.670 --> 54:39.990
- Jack what?

54:39.990 --> 54:40.823
Rabbit what?

54:41.775 --> 54:45.442
(inmates chatter distantly)

54:49.790 --> 54:52.707
(soft tense music)

54:59.622 --> 55:02.539
(soft tense music)

55:03.776 --> 55:05.880
- Hey, put my shit down, blood.

55:05.880 --> 55:07.480
Come on, finish your damn story.

55:08.327 --> 55:11.190
- [Baron] Well, after Mama went to heaven,

55:11.190 --> 55:13.950
I figured we didn't need
to rob no dang bank.

55:13.950 --> 55:15.150
- We gotta stay on track, puppet,

55:15.150 --> 55:16.137
we gotta stick to our plan--

55:16.137 --> 55:17.340
- No, no, I already decided.

55:17.340 --> 55:18.660
I'm gonna go back to the
post office tomorrow.

55:18.660 --> 55:20.104
I'm gonna get my job back.
- No you're not.

55:20.104 --> 55:20.937
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

55:20.937 --> 55:22.934
No, you're not!

55:22.934 --> 55:26.054
(Marmalade sighs)

55:26.054 --> 55:27.721
Oh god, I fucked up.

55:31.077 --> 55:33.577
(Baron sighs)

55:34.513 --> 55:36.510
I told myself I was gonna wait till after

55:36.510 --> 55:38.013
the goddamn robbery.

55:39.247 --> 55:41.373
Uh, I got such a big mouth!

55:45.807 --> 55:47.850
(boot clatters)

55:47.850 --> 55:49.773
I wanted to wait to surprise you.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.223
- Surprise me? What's the surprise?

55:57.257 --> 55:58.924
- That I'm pregnant.

55:59.939 --> 56:01.272
(both chuckle)

56:01.272 --> 56:03.318
I'm fucking pregnant.

56:03.318 --> 56:06.423
Uh-huh, and we're gonna have
a little puppet, puppet.

56:06.423 --> 56:09.340
(Marmalade laughs)

56:11.323 --> 56:13.830
(wood cracks)

56:13.830 --> 56:18.600
- Uh, dear, sweet Lord,
I pray that you up there,

56:18.600 --> 56:21.870
and Mama, you take
Marmalade and our little one

56:21.870 --> 56:24.750
in your arms today and protect
them during the stick up.

56:24.750 --> 56:26.313
'Cause Lord knows we are scared.

56:26.313 --> 56:28.890
- (laughs) I'm sorry, you're scared,

56:28.890 --> 56:30.600
and you just told me you're not
even going in the dang bank.

56:30.600 --> 56:31.433
Okay.

56:31.433 --> 56:33.120
- Well I told you I'm gonna
be the getaway driver.

56:33.120 --> 56:34.140
Okay?
- Cool, cool, cool,

56:34.140 --> 56:34.973
cool, cool, cool.

56:34.973 --> 56:36.010
- Yeah.
- Great stuff.

56:36.870 --> 56:38.130
- Amen.

56:38.130 --> 56:39.510
- Just to be clear is it,

56:39.510 --> 56:41.788
is it gonna be you or
Jesus taking the wheel?

56:41.788 --> 56:42.750
Just wondering.

56:42.750 --> 56:43.710
- It's gonna be both of us.

56:43.710 --> 56:45.330
- That's good. That's good news.

56:45.330 --> 56:46.688
- All right. Gear up, puppet boy.

56:46.688 --> 56:48.869
(bold rhythmic music)

56:48.869 --> 56:51.883
(toaster clicks)

56:51.883 --> 56:55.050
(bold rhythmic music)

56:59.701 --> 57:00.891
(Marmalade growls)

57:00.891 --> 57:03.543
(Marmalade exhales sharply)

57:03.543 --> 57:04.760
(zipper scratches)

57:04.760 --> 57:06.020
(boot stomps)

57:06.020 --> 57:09.187
(bold rhythmic music)

57:16.154 --> 57:18.071
Hey, where's your mask?

57:19.701 --> 57:22.469
Puppet, you have one freaking job.

57:22.469 --> 57:26.136
(mysterious rhythmic music)

57:31.264 --> 57:34.931
(mysterious rhythmic music)

57:37.497 --> 57:40.414
(can engine roars)

57:46.510 --> 57:49.177
(brakes squeal)

57:51.224 --> 57:53.614
Okay. (breathes heavily)

57:53.614 --> 57:55.781
And number eight, the job.

57:56.843 --> 57:57.676
All right.

58:00.300 --> 58:02.370
Gotta double mask it.

58:02.370 --> 58:03.990
For extra protection.

58:03.990 --> 58:08.557
- Hey. Hey. I'm worried
about you, both of you.

58:09.540 --> 58:12.480
- All right, look at me.
Leave the car running.

58:12.480 --> 58:15.030
When I come out, you fuckin'
gun it like a bat outta hell.

58:15.030 --> 58:15.863
Okay?

58:21.116 --> 58:24.533
(Baron breathes heavily)

58:29.340 --> 58:30.931
- Wait. Wait.

58:30.931 --> 58:31.764
- What?

58:31.764 --> 58:35.931
(tense haunting percussion music)

58:45.951 --> 58:49.034
(singing in Spanish)

58:56.712 --> 58:59.795
(singing in Spanish)

59:06.650 --> 59:09.733
(singing in Spanish)

59:16.550 --> 59:17.383
- [Singer] Uh-oh.

59:17.383 --> 59:19.380
- (claps) What're you doing?

59:19.380 --> 59:21.463
Get in the driver's seat.

59:23.973 --> 59:26.723
(car door slams)

59:28.139 --> 59:30.244
(car door slams)

59:30.244 --> 59:33.661
(Baron breathes heavily)

59:36.267 --> 59:40.788
- Oh, geez. (breathes heavily)

59:40.788 --> 59:44.038
(intense music swells)

59:48.600 --> 59:49.586
(gunshots blasts)

59:49.586 --> 59:51.336
- Go, go, go, go, go!

59:53.658 --> 59:55.151
(car engine revs)

59:55.151 --> 59:56.430
- Get in, get in.
- Go, go, go.

59:56.430 --> 59:57.597
- Get in.
- Go!

59:59.366 --> 01:00:03.033
(lively singing in Spanish)

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:13.077
(lively singing in Spanish)

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.110
(Marmalade laughs)

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:25.443
(both yell)

01:00:30.084 --> 01:00:31.798
(Marmalade yelps)

01:00:31.798 --> 01:00:35.670
(upbeat Latin music)

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:37.702
(Marmalade giggles)

01:00:37.702 --> 01:00:41.202
(Marmalade yells happily)

01:00:44.828 --> 01:00:49.808
Money, money, money, money. (laughs)

01:00:49.808 --> 01:00:51.866
- How much is that?

01:00:51.866 --> 01:00:53.283
- Um, like a lot.

01:00:54.801 --> 01:00:56.621
(laughs) Like a lot, a lot.

01:00:56.621 --> 01:00:58.248
(Baron chuckles hesitantly)

01:00:58.248 --> 01:01:00.450
- I thought you said we just
need a little to get started,

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:03.428
but this seems like
more than just a little.

01:01:03.428 --> 01:01:04.980
(Marmalade sputters)

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.181
- Well, I guess we got lucky.

01:01:08.181 --> 01:01:10.893
- I don't know, somethin'
doesn't smell right.

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.100
- Well, I can't smell, remember?

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.387
- No, it's not that. It's just uh...

01:01:23.583 --> 01:01:25.475
- You're a freaking
worrywart, you know that?

01:01:25.475 --> 01:01:28.642
- I know. I, I know. It's just, a lot.

01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:31.436
- Yeah, it's a lot.

01:01:31.436 --> 01:01:34.617
(laughs) Damn straight. So what?

01:01:34.617 --> 01:01:37.023
Must've just gotten a delivery today.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.800
- How'd you know that?

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.106
- I don't. Just fuckin' dumb luck.

01:01:45.106 --> 01:01:49.200
- (chuckles) Uh, how
come you know so much?

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.033
- About what?

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.960
- I don't know about this, about that,

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.223
about, about everything.

01:01:58.536 --> 01:02:01.893
- (scoffs) What's it matter?

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.151
- You said that when we
start our dream life--

01:02:07.151 --> 01:02:10.650
- This is our dream life.
It's already started.

01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:12.663
- Okay, so tell me the truth.

01:02:15.147 --> 01:02:17.730
(insects buzz)

01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:27.619
(Marmalade sighs)

01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:31.550
- Promise you won't get mad?

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:33.773
- Yeah.

01:02:39.894 --> 01:02:43.561
(Marmalade exhales sharply)

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:46.933
- I might've done this once before.

01:02:46.933 --> 01:02:48.573
A small bank out in Bug Bay.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:54.683
- That's it.
- Yeah.

01:02:59.797 --> 01:03:02.253
And another couple a banks too.

01:03:04.039 --> 01:03:07.170
(laughs) Fuck.

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:11.910
But they were all fuckin',
fuckin' chump change, you know?

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:12.743
Fuckin' pennies.

01:03:12.743 --> 01:03:15.810
It was nothing like
this, nothing like this.

01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:17.970
I wanted to throw in the
towel, puppet, I really did,

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:21.120
but, (sighs) fuck, then I met you.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:26.120
And I wanted, the whole
fuckin' world, and the moon.

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:31.182
- We gotta give this back.

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:33.000
(Marmalade laughs)

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.413
- Um, well no, we can't. We can't do that.

01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:40.700
- This was supposed to
be for Mama's pills.

01:03:42.623 --> 01:03:44.163
I think I need a minute.

01:03:49.918 --> 01:03:53.335
(insects buzz and chirp)

01:04:02.058 --> 01:04:04.975
(picture clatters)

01:04:06.014 --> 01:04:08.931
(Baron passes gas)

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.513
- Look, puppet.

01:04:14.086 --> 01:04:15.419
I don't wanna...

01:04:18.072 --> 01:04:19.572
Did you just fart?

01:04:22.712 --> 01:04:24.412
- Wait, I thought you can't smell?

01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:30.290
- Well I can't. But you got
this weird fuckin', guilty...

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:35.973
Look, whatever. I, I don't
wanna fight with you, puppet.

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:41.130
- My mind. You know I got a
lot stuck in there right now.

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:42.930
- Just remember, it's me and you

01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:44.543
against the whole wide world.

01:04:46.914 --> 01:04:49.454
- Yeah. And our baby.
- Huh?

01:04:49.454 --> 01:04:50.972
- Our baby.

01:04:50.972 --> 01:04:53.305
- Yeah. And our baby puppet.

01:04:58.789 --> 01:05:00.122
All three of us.

01:05:01.151 --> 01:05:01.984
- Yeah.

01:05:04.461 --> 01:05:05.544
- I love you.

01:05:07.692 --> 01:05:09.109
- I love you too.

01:05:13.022 --> 01:05:15.605
(insects buzz)

01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:20.373
(slow eerie music)

01:05:20.373 --> 01:05:22.415
♪ I will never know ♪

01:05:22.415 --> 01:05:24.919
♪ You will never show ♪

01:05:24.919 --> 01:05:26.577
(knocks on door)

01:05:26.577 --> 01:05:30.418
- Did the big baby get his
panties out of a bunch?

01:05:30.418 --> 01:05:32.880
(laughs) I'm just playing with you.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.587
Uh, baby, will you get the
uh, the masks out the car?

01:05:36.514 --> 01:05:37.347
- Why?

01:05:39.515 --> 01:05:42.182
- Um, because we gotta burn 'em.

01:05:45.223 --> 01:05:46.473
- Ah, burn 'em.

01:05:47.562 --> 01:05:48.395
Right.

01:05:49.516 --> 01:05:50.349
- Eh.

01:05:52.037 --> 01:05:55.454
(insects buzz and chirp)

01:05:58.994 --> 01:06:01.577
(gun clatters)

01:06:04.532 --> 01:06:07.115
(pills rattle)

01:06:08.401 --> 01:06:11.568
(slow haunting music)

01:06:17.005 --> 01:06:20.910
Hey baby, we gotta get rid
Big Bertha sooner than later.

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.810
(soft tense music)

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:24.643
Puppet?

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.850
- Why do you have Mama's pills?

01:06:40.219 --> 01:06:41.642
- What?

01:06:41.642 --> 01:06:44.309
(pills clatter)

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.350
What are you?

01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:51.767
(Baron breathes heavily)

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:58.880
Puppet, I was holding on to
those in case of an emergency.

01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:05.723
I put 'em in the car,
and I fuckin' forgot.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.593
Okay, I'm serious, I fuckin' forgot.

01:07:11.707 --> 01:07:14.624
(soft tense music)

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:20.160
We did everything we--

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.273
- Stop!

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:23.783
Just,

01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:26.363
stop.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:28.853
- Okay.

01:07:31.289 --> 01:07:34.534
- (sighs) I can't tell--

01:07:34.534 --> 01:07:36.837
- You can't tell if what?

01:07:38.953 --> 01:07:41.040
- I can't tell if you're being honest.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.830
- It was just Mama Eda's time.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.473
Okay?

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:48.700
It's been a really big fuckin' day.

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:52.560
I'm taxed, you're fuckin' taxed.

01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:55.120
Let's just put the--

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:55.953
- Don't come any closer.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.499
- Let's put the gun down, puppet.

01:08:00.499 --> 01:08:02.999
(sirens wail)

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:09.808
- What are we gonna do?

01:08:09.808 --> 01:08:14.052
- All right. Now come on
out here or we're coming in.

01:08:14.052 --> 01:08:15.075
Choice is yours.

01:08:15.075 --> 01:08:16.718
- We gotta, we gotta go
outside and apologise.

01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:17.550
Okay?

01:08:18.448 --> 01:08:19.281
Okay?

01:08:19.281 --> 01:08:21.660
- All right baby, baby. Just focus. Okay?

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:25.889
All right. We just gotta
split the money and run. Okay?

01:08:25.889 --> 01:08:27.450
You know that spot that we like,

01:08:27.450 --> 01:08:28.282
the spot that we talked about?

01:08:28.282 --> 01:08:29.853
- Yeah.
- We go there.

01:08:29.853 --> 01:08:31.283
And, and, and if one of us doesn't show,

01:08:31.283 --> 01:08:32.319
then that means the other one got nabbed.

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:33.569
Okay?
- Okay.

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:34.740
- And uh, if that happens

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.770
then one of us just fuckin'
disappears forever, okay?

01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:39.510
- Forever?

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:42.981
- Look at me. 3:30, tomorrow.

01:08:42.981 --> 01:08:43.814
- [Officer] All right, you got

01:08:43.814 --> 01:08:45.163
10 seconds, lady.
- All right? Say you got it.

01:08:45.163 --> 01:08:46.290
- 3:30 tomorrow.

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:47.612
- Say you got it.
- I got it. I got it.

01:08:47.612 --> 01:08:49.153
- I fuckin' got it.
- I fuckin' got it.

01:08:49.153 --> 01:08:49.986
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:08:49.986 --> 01:08:51.361
- [Officer] All right.

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:52.305
- Come here. Come here. Come here.

01:08:52.305 --> 01:08:53.805
- [Officer] Eight,

01:08:54.803 --> 01:08:55.636
seven.

01:08:58.153 --> 01:09:00.870
- I never loved anyone like I love you.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.542
And nobody's ever loved me like, hm.

01:09:06.888 --> 01:09:08.805
Nobody's ever loved me.

01:09:12.791 --> 01:09:15.252
You're the man of my fuckin' dreams.

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:18.835
(gentle melancholic music)

01:09:25.317 --> 01:09:27.693
(gentle melancholic music)

01:09:27.693 --> 01:09:30.359
3:30 tomorrow. Okay, puppet? (laughs)

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:34.026
(gentle melancholic music)

01:09:36.285 --> 01:09:39.368
Hey, dream big or don't dream at all.

01:09:41.236 --> 01:09:44.486
(gentle dreamy music)

01:09:45.841 --> 01:09:47.962
- [Officer] Six,

01:09:47.962 --> 01:09:48.796
five,

01:09:50.081 --> 01:09:50.914
four,

01:09:52.547 --> 01:09:53.380
three.

01:09:55.062 --> 01:09:55.978
- I'm here.

01:09:57.356 --> 01:09:58.856
- Two.
- I'm here!

01:10:00.835 --> 01:10:01.668
I'm sorry!

01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:05.493
(dramatic swoosh)

01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:06.326
Marmalade!

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.750
- Where's she at?

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:19.050
- She'll be there at 3:30, waiting for me.

01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:19.883
- Where?

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.490
- It's a secret place only
me and her know about,

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:24.590
there's not much time.

01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:28.083
- Don't play me, blood. We had a deal.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.177
- You break me out, I show
you the way. $250,000.

01:10:38.389 --> 01:10:39.222
(book thuds)

01:10:39.222 --> 01:10:40.740
(Otis sniffles)

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:44.400
- All right. You ever think
she double timing you, homie?

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.075
You know what I'm saying?

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:48.450
You had your finger on the trigger, dog.

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:51.450
Remember that? You ever think
she ain't planning on showing?

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.719
- Do you believe our love?

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:02.223
'Cause I know what I know,
and I done feel what I feel.

01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:05.823
Rest ain't up to me.

01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:19.233
- Here's what we about to
do, Jack Rabbit parole.

01:11:21.559 --> 01:11:24.392
(Cambio whistles)

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.553
- There's nothing either good or bad,

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.678
but thinking makes it so.

01:11:36.678 --> 01:11:38.385
(keys clink)

01:11:38.385 --> 01:11:41.468
(cell door clatters)

01:11:43.077 --> 01:11:46.743
- Hey, hey, hey. Lay low till it's on.

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:50.777
(soft tense music)

01:11:56.224 --> 01:11:59.141
(soft tense music)

01:12:04.478 --> 01:12:07.395
(soft tense music)

01:12:11.109 --> 01:12:13.609
(door clicks)

01:12:16.817 --> 01:12:19.383
- Inmate 3-2-6, laundry pickup.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.210
Put this on. Get in.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.443
Bounce, blood, bounce.

01:12:29.837 --> 01:12:33.922
(laundry cart clatters)

01:12:33.922 --> 01:12:36.839
(soft tense music)

01:12:42.068 --> 01:12:44.986
(soft tense music)

01:12:51.874 --> 01:12:54.791
(soft tense music)

01:13:07.143 --> 01:13:10.327
(keys clatter)

01:13:10.327 --> 01:13:12.910
(lock jiggles)

01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:24.180
- Problem there, bud?

01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:26.510
- I'm straight, blood.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.670
- Straight, huh?

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:30.503
- Yep.

01:13:30.503 --> 01:13:31.500
- Laundry goes in the east end, my guy.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.576
- Yeah, I heard you, bruh.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:35.402
(lock clicks)

01:13:35.402 --> 01:13:37.902
(keys jiggle)

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.178
Hey, hey, you go get your Marmalade.

01:13:46.178 --> 01:13:48.710
- Hey, hey. You got a hearing problem?

01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:51.045
- You go get your girl.

01:13:51.045 --> 01:13:53.827
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:13:53.827 --> 01:13:56.059
- Just calm down, I said it's cool.

01:13:56.059 --> 01:13:58.559
(tense music)

01:14:03.412 --> 01:14:06.000
(birds chirp)

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.202
(curious acoustic music)

01:14:09.202 --> 01:14:11.700
- Stay down.
I keep telling you now--

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:12.532
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:13.391
- I'm with you.
- Just stay down.

01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:14.403
- FBI, he's clear, he's clear.

01:14:14.403 --> 01:14:17.130
- Shit. Get your fuckin'
Walmart cop. Shit.

01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:20.070
What the hell happened? The
plan was to go with him.

01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:21.930
- I know, and Chief interfered.

01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:23.160
We couldn't get here in time.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:23.993
- Are they tracking him?

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:24.826
- Yes, every move.

01:14:24.826 --> 01:14:26.570
- Okay, he should be wide open by now.

01:14:27.916 --> 01:14:29.723
- (exhales sharply) Let's roll.

01:14:29.723 --> 01:14:33.056
(upbeat rhythmic music)

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:38.627
- APB is out. Puzzle
piece tattoo on her neck.

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:43.440
- Oh and a, a heart
tattoo on her left ankle

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.496
with the name Baron.

01:14:44.496 --> 01:14:45.329
- Okay.

01:14:45.329 --> 01:14:47.520
- Possibly strawberry blonde or pink hair.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.380
Armed and dangerous.

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:51.990
- Once more into the breach, dear friends.

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.823
- [Cambio And Gray] Once more.

01:14:52.823 --> 01:14:54.780
- Honestly, Ted, you gotta
come up with something

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:55.803
other than the Shakespeare
character, okay?

01:14:55.803 --> 01:14:58.260
It's all a bit intense, brother.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.300
- Got some notes for
your performance as well.

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.133
- Sorry, what was that?

01:15:01.133 --> 01:15:03.420
- [Police Officer] Suspect's
vehicle pulling over up ahead.

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:04.469
- Copy that.

01:15:04.469 --> 01:15:06.360
- [Police Officer] Looking
like some sort of general store

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.763
on the north side of Main Street.

01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:17.430
- What do y'all think he's getting?

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:20.163
- Well, hopefully something
for her with any luck.

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:26.250
Jesus, be a miracle if
he can make it anywhere

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:27.083
in that lemon.

01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:29.550
I mean, where'd we find
this piece of shit?

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:31.139
- Don't know.

01:15:31.139 --> 01:15:34.202
- It's my personal,
sir. Opted to volunteer.

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:38.433
- Good, thank, thank you. Good job.

01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:41.083
Oh, there we go.

01:15:42.915 --> 01:15:43.748
(car ignition starts)

01:15:43.748 --> 01:15:45.030
We're on the move.

01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:48.362
(upbeat rhythmic music)

01:15:54.304 --> 01:15:57.637
(upbeat rhythmic music)

01:16:05.385 --> 01:16:07.455
- [Police Officer] Hey boss,
car two in position over here

01:16:07.455 --> 01:16:10.290
in case he goes over the hill.

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:15.903
- [Otis] You only get one mama.

01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:21.740
- You really took a
shine to that kid, huh?

01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:27.045
- Poor guy. He'll do
five to 10 for accessory.

01:16:27.045 --> 01:16:27.960
- Ooh.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.559
- At least he got to see
his Mama Eda one more time.

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.323
And knock on wood, his girl as well.

01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.862
On the move.

01:16:38.437 --> 01:16:41.353
(soft tense music)

01:16:47.957 --> 01:16:50.874
(soft tense music)

01:16:55.387 --> 01:16:57.059
- [Police Officer] Just hold there, boss.

01:16:57.059 --> 01:16:59.160
It looks like he's stopping up here again.

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:08.400
- Be advised, location
could be a nest egg.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.070
Keep your eyes peeled for a positive ID.

01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:12.713
- [Police Officer] Hey, Roger that.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:17.070
- [Cambio] Why's he stopping here?

01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:18.543
- They like their ice cream.

01:17:24.812 --> 01:17:27.000
Oh, come on, Marmalade, where you at?

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.350
Where you at? Where you at?

01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:31.903
- 3:15.

01:17:31.903 --> 01:17:34.889
- All right, remember, they're
supposed to meet at 3:30.

01:17:34.889 --> 01:17:37.083
Here we go. Next one's the drop.

01:17:39.049 --> 01:17:42.049
(slow sombre music)

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.170
Right turn in 10 minutes. Eyes on.

01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:48.153
Right. Follow. Follow.

01:17:49.068 --> 01:17:51.811
(tyres squeal)

01:17:51.811 --> 01:17:52.644
(object thuds)

01:17:52.644 --> 01:17:54.540
- Oh, Christ on a cracker.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:55.680
- Man, what is he doing?

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.180
- He's going around the block.

01:18:03.026 --> 01:18:05.942
(tyres squeal)

01:18:05.942 --> 01:18:07.380
Hang back, hang back.

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.080
He's seeing if anyone's following.

01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:11.602
This is it.

01:18:11.602 --> 01:18:14.102
(tense music)

01:18:15.068 --> 01:18:17.047
- [Gray] Oh, do you see her?

01:18:18.654 --> 01:18:20.901
- Fuck, fuck, fuck. Move
in, move in, move in.

01:18:20.901 --> 01:18:25.901
(sirens wail)
(daunting music)

01:18:26.978 --> 01:18:27.811
- FBI.
- FBI.

01:18:27.811 --> 01:18:28.644
- Yeah, come on,

01:18:28.644 --> 01:18:29.477
let's get your hands up.
- Get outta the car.

01:18:29.477 --> 01:18:30.309
- Hands up.
- Hands up.

01:18:30.309 --> 01:18:31.270
- Hands up.
- Get outta the car.

01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:32.790
Outta the car right now.

01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:33.782
Do not move.

01:18:34.889 --> 01:18:36.440
- He said I could keep the car.

01:18:37.938 --> 01:18:40.290
(driver shudders)

01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:41.180
- It's clear.

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:44.097
(dramatic banging)

01:18:53.511 --> 01:18:57.178
(intense adventurous music)

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:02.335
(siren wails)

01:19:07.568 --> 01:19:09.510
- Put an APB out for two people now.

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:11.850
I repeat, a couple,
potentially heading north.

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:14.430
Make sure all the perimeter
checkpoints are locked down.

01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:16.170
They cannot get away.

01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:18.522
- Now special agent, where are you going?

01:19:18.522 --> 01:19:22.189
(intense adventurous music)

01:19:24.575 --> 01:19:27.575
(slow sombre music)

01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:35.687
(Baron breathes heavily)

01:19:38.255 --> 01:19:41.255
(deep gentle music)

01:19:46.467 --> 01:19:51.467
(Baron grunts)
(bricks crumble)

01:19:56.068 --> 01:19:59.485
(deep suspenseful music)

01:20:01.776 --> 01:20:04.713
(zipper scratches)

01:20:04.713 --> 01:20:08.130
(deep suspenseful music)

01:20:14.893 --> 01:20:18.309
(deep suspenseful music)

01:20:25.255 --> 01:20:27.755
(money flips)

01:20:30.045 --> 01:20:31.045
- I got you.

01:20:32.276 --> 01:20:35.152
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:20:35.152 --> 01:20:39.277
No, I don't, no, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:20:39.277 --> 01:20:42.527
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:20:43.607 --> 01:20:45.210
- Do you have the, uh, uh, uh,

01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:47.483
the security photos from the bank?

01:20:47.483 --> 01:20:50.983
(tense suspenseful music)

01:20:57.575 --> 01:21:01.075
(tense suspenseful music)

01:21:03.175 --> 01:21:04.253
Move, move, move. Move, move.

01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:09.252
- [Gray] What's up?
What're you looking for?

01:21:09.252 --> 01:21:12.752
(tense suspenseful music)

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.780
- Shit.

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:16.612
- What?

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:25.032
- That is not Marmalade's tattoo.

01:21:25.032 --> 01:21:28.366
(upbeat rhythmic music)

01:21:30.031 --> 01:21:32.469
♪ A little softer, people get softer ♪

01:21:32.469 --> 01:21:35.237

(car engine rumbles)

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:51.562
- Go ahead and pop your trunk.

01:21:51.562 --> 01:21:53.952
(truck clicks)

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:57.202
(tense haunting music)

01:22:02.654 --> 01:22:05.904
(tense haunting music)

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:10.630
- [Officer] All clear, Sarge.

01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:16.469
- Have yourself a pleasant day, ma'am.

01:22:16.469 --> 01:22:17.303
- Take care now.

01:22:18.332 --> 01:22:21.415
(car engine rumbles)

01:22:23.364 --> 01:22:26.864
(tense adventurous music)

01:22:32.237 --> 01:22:35.218
(Baron laughs)

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:40.264

♪ Clap your hands now ♪

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:47.160
- Sir, what should they be
looking for at the perimeter now?

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:47.993
- You know what?

01:22:47.993 --> 01:22:50.070
I have no idea which way
we're facing right now.

01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.903
No fucking clue.

01:22:50.903 --> 01:22:53.977
I just, all right just, change it back to

01:22:53.977 --> 01:22:57.317
a lone male suspect, Southern drawl.

01:22:57.317 --> 01:22:59.107
I don't, I don't, I don't,
I don't, I don't know.

01:22:59.107 --> 01:22:59.940
I don't know.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:00.900
- Copy that.

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:03.240
Wait, what, what about the girl?

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.202
- There is no girl.

01:23:07.474 --> 01:23:08.587
- What?

01:23:08.587 --> 01:23:10.005
- There is no girl.

01:23:10.005 --> 01:23:12.860
(door bells jingle)

01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:16.027
(deep haunting music)

01:23:21.617 --> 01:23:22.450
- Hey there.

01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:23.850
- Hey, how can I help you?

01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:27.300
- So, I called in an order a
few days ago for Pleonexia.

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.280
- Ah, remind me of the name again.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:32.040
- Uh, Lamram. L-A-M-R-A-M.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.103
- Uh, starting to think
you weren't gonna show.

01:23:36.539 --> 01:23:38.163
- Well, I had a little hold up.

01:23:39.570 --> 01:23:43.080
- 408 Ronson Drive. Thank you. Thank you.

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:46.770
Sir! Sir, I got the address.

01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:47.603
- The what?

01:23:47.603 --> 01:23:48.719
- The address from the tracking,

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:50.469
made from the phone call in prison.

01:23:52.469 --> 01:23:53.303
- Get in.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.290
- [Cambio] Headquarters traced the number

01:23:58.290 --> 01:24:01.350
back to some sort of
pharmaceutical company.

01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:03.327
- That's it. Lamram, Lamram.

01:24:04.183 --> 01:24:05.766
Lamram, Lamram. Ah.

01:24:07.019 --> 01:24:10.098
(door bells jingle)

01:24:10.098 --> 01:24:13.230
(tense music)

01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:14.933
- Right here. It's right,
right, right, right, right.

01:24:15.843 --> 01:24:18.812
(tyres squeal)

01:24:18.812 --> 01:24:19.688
(sirens wail)

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:22.767
- [Gray] Officer
approaching, let us through.

01:24:22.767 --> 01:24:24.850
- Here, here, here, here.

01:24:28.278 --> 01:24:30.460
- Expensive brand of drugs, huh?

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:33.633
Damn Warbucks. Rich just
keep getting richer.

01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:35.423
- Where are we?

01:24:35.423 --> 01:24:36.396
- I don't know what street this is.

01:24:36.396 --> 01:24:37.443
- You're looking at the map.

01:24:37.443 --> 01:24:38.678
- Is this Randall?

01:24:38.678 --> 01:24:41.550
(tyres squeal)

01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:45.813
- Got my whole supply there,
every last pill. It's for you?

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:50.513
- No.

01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:54.770
They're for my mom.

01:24:55.739 --> 01:24:58.473
Well, my foster mom.

01:25:00.865 --> 01:25:02.825
(bag thuds)

01:25:02.825 --> 01:25:05.502
(tense suspenseful music)

01:25:05.502 --> 01:25:07.068
- Left, left. Here, here, here, here.

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:08.715
Yeah, yeah, yep, yep.

01:25:08.715 --> 01:25:11.782
(tyres squeal)

01:25:11.782 --> 01:25:13.205
- You oughta been here
a little (indistinct),

01:25:13.205 --> 01:25:14.538
you fucking pig.

01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:17.219
About goddamn time.

01:25:17.219 --> 01:25:18.510
- Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.

01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:20.010
- Sorry? You should be sorry.

01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:22.530
The sheriff's office said
someone would be here by noon.

01:25:22.530 --> 01:25:25.380
- Sir, I think there's
been a, a misunderstanding.

01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:27.873
- A block of money gone kapoof.

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:31.860
Misunderstanding, my asshole.

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:34.290
- Well, sir, I, I'm sorry I don't follow.

01:25:34.290 --> 01:25:36.450
- I used to transit through Bug Bay,

01:25:36.450 --> 01:25:38.013
and that shit hole was ripping us too.

01:25:38.013 --> 01:25:39.719
- Sir, you said Bug Bay?

01:25:39.719 --> 01:25:42.360
- Are you deaf? Yes, Bug Bay.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.550
What're y'all, just sitting
around with your thumbs up

01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:45.870
your prison purses.

01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:46.702
- Wait a minute now.

01:25:46.702 --> 01:25:49.287
It was your money that
was stolen in the robbery?

01:25:49.287 --> 01:25:53.430
- Oh, dear god. Am I not speaking English?

01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:55.500
Half a million fucking dollars of mine

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.330
was stolen from some
podunk bank yesterday.

01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:02.010
- Okay. Okay. Let's just all calm down.

01:26:02.010 --> 01:26:05.403
Sir, is this your place of business?

01:26:06.450 --> 01:26:09.273
- Goddamn right. Don Frankels, CEO.

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:13.230
(eerie music)

01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:14.580
- Baron Pharmaceuticals.

01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:16.200
- [Don] Insurance company
shittin' themselves

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.900
and y'all can't even identify the victim.

01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:20.763
- Baron Pharmaceuticals.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.763
Sir, you don't make the
drug Pleonexia by chance?

01:26:27.763 --> 01:26:31.383
- (laughs) Yes sir, we do.

01:26:32.893 --> 01:26:33.726
(Otis chuckles)

01:26:33.726 --> 01:26:36.180
You know, I, I'm guessing that
y'all ain't got no updates

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:40.068
for me, so, kindly just scuttle
the fuck off my property

01:26:40.068 --> 01:26:43.320
and go find my bills.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.763
Sons of bitches, worthless.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.440
- Mr. Frankels. Excuse me, sir.

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.273
- What?

01:26:55.139 --> 01:26:56.463
- Do you foster children?

01:26:59.190 --> 01:27:00.023
- Come again?

01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:03.753
- Foster children, you
have any, or have you ever?

01:27:05.121 --> 01:27:07.920
- Uh, the fuck that's
gotta do with anything?

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.673
- Do you foster children?

01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:17.833
- Damn right I do.

01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:21.960
You take a bunch a junkie rejects

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.559
and you make 'em into something.

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:29.823
- We'll be in touch.

01:27:34.559 --> 01:27:35.523
- Useless pricks.

01:27:37.466 --> 01:27:40.799
(slow mysterious music)

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:46.407
Linda, get the goddamn
sheriff on the phone.

01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:49.163
- [Gray] What was that about?

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:50.969
- Everything's a puzzle piece.

01:27:50.969 --> 01:27:52.380
Find his address, send a unit over

01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.570
to Mr. Frankel's house immediately.

01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:56.120
- Wait a minute now. What's up?

01:27:57.393 --> 01:28:00.059
- I just, I, I, I got a feeling that I,

01:28:00.059 --> 01:28:02.340
we'll find something.

01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:05.760
- Requesting a home address
for a Don or Donald Frankels.

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:07.530
- Tell 'em to look for a back garage or,

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:09.224
or speak to the foster kids.

01:28:09.224 --> 01:28:10.705
- All right, be on the
lookout for a garage.

01:28:10.705 --> 01:28:12.450
- Find something like what?

01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:17.450
- I don't know. Cages, maybe.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.353
- Cages?

01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:22.559
Cages. You think that he's--

01:28:22.559 --> 01:28:24.630
- Marmalade said that
her abuser had a cane

01:28:24.630 --> 01:28:26.490
and a slight twitch in
his eye when he got mad.

01:28:26.490 --> 01:28:27.809
Does that ring any bells?

01:28:27.809 --> 01:28:28.643
- Sir?

01:28:28.643 --> 01:28:29.476
- Yeah.

01:28:29.476 --> 01:28:31.500
- There's a unit, a block
away from his house.

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.780
It has a garage, and
outside they just spotted

01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.898
a jar of marmalade.

01:28:35.898 --> 01:28:37.391
(hand smacks)

01:28:37.391 --> 01:28:38.318
(sirens chirp)

01:28:38.318 --> 01:28:39.277
- [Police Officer] (indistinct) Now,

01:28:39.277 --> 01:28:43.693
(indistinct) when we process him in.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.023
- Three cages, apparently.

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.260
No recent use, luckily,

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:55.623
but evidence all over the place.

01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.559
- Chief's questioning the foster kids now.

01:28:59.490 --> 01:29:03.782
- So, what's real, hm?
What's real? What's fake?

01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:08.103
- Could use a drink.

01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:12.603
- Well, there's a watering
hole about a block over.

01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:15.110
- I'll meet you there.

01:29:17.625 --> 01:29:20.153
- A man in his lifetime plays many parts.

01:29:27.653 --> 01:29:32.653
- Come on now. First round's
on me, blood. (laughs)

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:36.960
I'll never do it again, sir.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.793
- No.

01:29:42.367 --> 01:29:47.367
(indistinct police radio
chatter in background)

01:29:47.651 --> 01:29:50.151
(Velcro rips)

01:29:53.877 --> 01:29:56.794
(soft tense music)

01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:02.663
(haunting music swells)

01:30:09.427 --> 01:30:14.427
(footsteps shuffle)
(soft tense music)

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.120
(door bells jingle)

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.790
- Afternoon, FBI. Did
you happen to see a man--

01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:27.990
- I got nothing to do with it.

01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:30.068
I don't know nothing about all this.

01:30:30.068 --> 01:30:32.568
(badge thuds)

01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:36.450
He got his pills and he disappeared

01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:38.013
like a fart in a fan factory.

01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:42.000
- I'm sorry, um, I'm
sorry, what, what pills?

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.200
- Pleonexia.

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.280
- For what?

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:48.360
- I don't know. For his mom.
Look, I don't need any--

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.320
- Where'd he go?

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.719
- Said he was buying
tickets, around the corner.

01:30:53.776 --> 01:30:56.276
(car rumbles)

01:30:58.496 --> 01:31:01.496
(suspenseful music)

01:31:08.208 --> 01:31:10.958
(tropical music)

01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:17.093
- Aloha, Bonjour. Don't just
book it. Thomas Cook it.

01:31:17.093 --> 01:31:19.200
- How you doing? I was wondering--

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.282
- Agent Huxley?

01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:22.680
- Yeah?

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.740
- Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:28.503
I've got everything all set right here.

01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:33.719
FBI. (laughs)

01:31:33.719 --> 01:31:35.160
Sh.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:35.993
- I'm, I'm...

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:39.660
- He said you were gonna be right over.

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.240
Uh, I didn't realise it was gonna be

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.490
so lickety split though.

01:31:44.490 --> 01:31:46.410
I mean, it's a, it's a, it's a good thing.

01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:47.510
I, I, (clears throat).

01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:51.993
He left a note for ya.

01:31:53.670 --> 01:31:56.639
I'm uh, very sorry for your loss.

01:31:56.639 --> 01:31:57.473
- My what?

01:31:58.466 --> 01:31:59.612
- I might've peaked.

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:06.240
If you need me, I'm here.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.370
- I need you to stop reading
people's mail. It's illegal.

01:32:11.309 --> 01:32:14.142
(door bangs shut)

01:32:20.117 --> 01:32:22.784
(gentle music)

01:32:24.452 --> 01:32:27.123
- [Baron] Life can only
be understood backwards,

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.303
but it must be lived forwards.

01:32:31.469 --> 01:32:34.743
I'm taking care of my mother.
I hope you'll do the same.

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.733
Farewell, secret agent.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.183

01:32:50.108 --> 01:32:52.691
