WEBVTT

01:43.291 --> 01:44.375
Oll!

01:44.458 --> 01:45.833
Get it in gear!

01:47.041 --> 01:48.541
Let's go! Let's go!

01:48.625 --> 01:52.250
If we don't make this trip, it'll be days
before we get another chance.

01:52.333 --> 01:53.208
A chance for what?

01:53.291 --> 01:55.375
Chasing down this bunny's imagination?

01:55.458 --> 01:57.041
It ain't my imagination.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.166
I am warning you.

02:00.041 --> 02:02.125
Imagine you actually made it on this boat.

02:02.208 --> 02:04.083
-Hey!
-Bye-bye, bunny.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.541
Here we go.

02:08.750 --> 02:09.708
Whoa!

02:27.291 --> 02:28.333
Where's Ollie?

02:28.416 --> 02:30.416
Uh, I don't know.

02:32.666 --> 02:33.500
Hey.

02:34.333 --> 02:35.625
She just ditched me.

02:35.708 --> 02:37.541
I didn't do anything to you, rabbit.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.083
I don't know who you are
or why you're here.

02:40.166 --> 02:41.625
Hell, I don't know why I'm here.

02:41.708 --> 02:44.916
Zozo, let's drop this Jasper off
somewhere and move on.

02:45.000 --> 02:45.833
Now, Rosy--

02:45.916 --> 02:48.833
Just you and me together again,
like the old days.

02:48.916 --> 02:50.375
We're looking for Billy.

02:50.458 --> 02:52.208
-I have a map.
-Oh.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.291
Is that what that is?

02:57.041 --> 02:58.041
This sucks.

02:58.125 --> 02:59.208
The White Tower?

02:59.291 --> 03:00.666
-Rosy--
-It's real!

03:00.750 --> 03:01.875
Real stupid.

03:01.958 --> 03:06.208
Oh. And what's this messed-up rectangle
with circles?

03:06.291 --> 03:08.458
-Rosy!
-That is Mark Twain.

03:08.541 --> 03:09.625
Right.

03:09.708 --> 03:11.791
And pardon, is this troll to scale?

03:11.875 --> 03:14.291
-Are you a licensed cartographer?
-Rosy.

03:14.375 --> 03:16.041
Man, this is a load of crap.

03:16.125 --> 03:17.375
It's all real.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.541
Then prove it.

03:25.833 --> 03:27.041
Rosy!

03:27.125 --> 03:32.041
I think you of all people should know
what it feels like to get left behind.

03:47.166 --> 03:48.250
Maybe she's right.

03:48.958 --> 03:50.208
Maybe this is stupid.

03:50.291 --> 03:52.750
Hey, don't worry about old Rosy.

03:53.250 --> 03:54.625
I believe in you.

03:54.708 --> 03:57.125
And I believe in these memories of yours.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.166
Now, let's get up
on the roof of this vessel

03:59.250 --> 04:01.708
and find the next spot on your map.

04:11.875 --> 04:12.791
Arr.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.666
Matey, don't give up so quickly,

04:15.750 --> 04:18.250
for you're sailing with Captain Candyhook!

04:18.333 --> 04:19.625
Now we playing baby games?

04:19.708 --> 04:21.583
Ruler of the Seven Seas!

04:21.666 --> 04:23.625
Tamer of serpents!

04:23.708 --> 04:25.500
Lover of peppermint!

04:26.541 --> 04:29.125
There be treasure on the upper deck.

04:29.208 --> 04:32.833
And whoever gets there first
is the new captain of this ship.

04:32.916 --> 04:35.958
Let me see your prowess, bucko,

04:36.041 --> 04:39.041
and show that swabbie what's what.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.791
And just who's the swabbie
in this scenario?

04:41.875 --> 04:43.916
Wait. Oh, hell, no.

04:45.291 --> 04:47.875
-Yar!
-Absolutely not cool.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.791
Now go!

04:49.875 --> 04:50.833
Get!

04:50.916 --> 04:52.583
Woo-hoo!

04:52.666 --> 04:54.166
Swords ain't for bunnies.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.458
What's wrong, Rosy?

05:00.541 --> 05:03.541
Can't handle a true buccaneer
wielding your sword?

05:03.625 --> 05:07.166
The only buccaneers I see
are flapping off your bucking head.

05:09.541 --> 05:11.333
Now, get out of my way, fool!

05:36.958 --> 05:38.625
Whoa!

05:46.708 --> 05:47.666
Ha, ha!

05:47.750 --> 05:48.916
I win!

05:49.000 --> 05:50.625
I'm the new captain.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.833
I almost lost my star 'cause of you.

05:56.416 --> 05:57.958
Pirates don't play fair.

05:58.041 --> 05:59.458
Everybody knows that.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.750
Rosy, stop it.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.208
I've had enough.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.291
Zozo, why are you taking his side?

06:09.375 --> 06:10.875
Why is he so special?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.208
Why is she so mad all the time?

06:17.291 --> 06:20.041
Let old Rosy pout if she wants to,

06:20.125 --> 06:22.833
but we're gonna find
the next spot on your map.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.166
We found the Dark River,

06:24.250 --> 06:27.708
and if you focus,
we'll find the next clue and the next,

06:27.791 --> 06:32.708
and before you know it,
you'll be back home with Billy, I promise.

06:33.208 --> 06:34.708
Now, look at this map.

06:34.791 --> 06:38.125
Squeeze that star
and see what you can see.

06:41.416 --> 06:44.541
The Rabid Rabbit launches
into the mud pit,

06:44.625 --> 06:46.208
through the hoops of fire.

06:46.291 --> 06:48.666
Can he set this record?

06:48.750 --> 06:51.333
Oh! And the crowd goes wild!

06:51.416 --> 06:55.458
Ah! For the most amazing jump
of the night. What's that? This just in.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.791
The prize for the winner is--

06:58.750 --> 07:00.666
Daddy, can I have some drums?

07:00.750 --> 07:02.208
And...

07:03.000 --> 07:04.250
doing the dishes!

07:04.333 --> 07:06.041
-Momma, boo!
-Come on!

07:06.125 --> 07:07.625
That prize is so awful

07:07.708 --> 07:10.750
that the announcer herself
has to go in the mud pit.

07:10.833 --> 07:12.291
-What an upset!
-Oh!

07:13.000 --> 07:15.458
You thought throwing a biscuit
at me was punishment?

07:15.541 --> 07:18.416
I think eating your biscuit's
punishment enough.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.000
Yes! You're in trouble now!

07:24.083 --> 07:26.125
Who's gonna clean it! Billy, help!

07:26.208 --> 07:27.083
-Hey.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.041
Who calls during supper? What's this?

07:29.125 --> 07:30.791
Who knows?

07:30.875 --> 07:32.583
There you go. Billy the receptionist.

07:32.666 --> 07:34.083
Thank you, Billy.

07:34.166 --> 07:35.625
Well, now, look at this.

07:35.708 --> 07:38.583
-I thought you loved my biscuits.
-Yeah, your biscuits are okay.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.166
Wiles' residence.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.750
It's for Momma.

07:41.833 --> 07:43.958
No one ever calls for old Billy.

07:44.041 --> 07:45.291
I'll call you, baby.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.083
Hello.

07:47.583 --> 07:48.583
This is she.

07:48.666 --> 07:49.708
Hello?

07:51.083 --> 07:52.916
-Yes, this is Billy.
-Yes.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.583
Uh, give me a second.

07:55.666 --> 07:58.666
Can you bring Billy outside
so I can take this call?

08:00.083 --> 08:02.583
But, Momma, it's chilly out there
and I'm still eating.

08:02.666 --> 08:06.333
Then zip up your sweater
and grab a biscuit. Go outside. Get.

08:07.708 --> 08:11.291
Hey, let's go listen to some Caywood
and play some horse. What do you say?

08:11.375 --> 08:13.666
That sound fun? Let's go play.

08:13.750 --> 08:17.291
Ollie drives down the middle,
spins, fakes and--

08:17.375 --> 08:18.250
Y'all, please!

08:20.291 --> 08:22.125
What do you say just us real folks play?

08:22.208 --> 08:23.958
Leave Ollie behind?

08:33.166 --> 08:34.541
Sorry, can you repeat that?

08:38.166 --> 08:40.000
Um, let me get a pen.

08:43.125 --> 08:44.125
Uh-huh.

08:45.708 --> 08:46.791
In the zone!

08:46.875 --> 08:50.083
Over there. I'm gonna feed you my pass,
you take it and pop.

08:52.791 --> 08:56.250
Okay, okay. Over here.
I'll pass it on the run.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.791
More tests? Why?

08:59.666 --> 09:02.000
Now we're talking!
Over here! Let's go!

09:04.416 --> 09:05.291
Okay.

09:06.291 --> 09:07.291
Um...

09:08.750 --> 09:09.708
Uh...

09:11.166 --> 09:12.833
How much is that gonna cost?

09:18.416 --> 09:19.833
No, no insurance.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.916
Can this wait until--?

09:31.291 --> 09:32.125
This week?

09:32.208 --> 09:34.458
I don't have a sitter and--

09:37.708 --> 09:38.541
Okay.

09:40.416 --> 09:41.250
This week.

09:43.041 --> 09:43.875
Okay.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.583
Bye.

09:53.333 --> 09:54.833
Whoa! What's that face?

09:54.916 --> 09:56.583
Did you see the next stop?

09:56.666 --> 09:58.625
Something's wrong with Momma.

09:58.708 --> 09:59.541
She's worried.

09:59.625 --> 10:04.750
She's gotta go somewhere and take a test.

10:04.833 --> 10:05.666
I'm Ollie.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.375
I need hugs and constant attention.

10:07.458 --> 10:11.458
I'm jealous of what a great pirate Rosy is
'cause my ears are stupid.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.625
Well, I'll be damned.

10:22.666 --> 10:24.291
Come on, that's it?

10:24.375 --> 10:25.875
What's she worried about?

10:25.958 --> 10:26.958
I don't know.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.666
My memories, they're like...

10:31.041 --> 10:33.083
water that I can't control,

10:33.166 --> 10:35.333
coming and going as they please.

10:35.416 --> 10:37.291
-No! No!

10:37.375 --> 10:38.916
That was close.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.458
You gotta protect this
with your life, Ollie.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.916
The White Tower!

10:51.500 --> 10:52.708
It is real!

10:52.791 --> 10:54.625
I told you we'd find it.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.625
Like you can miss it.

10:59.583 --> 11:00.416
Wait.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.166
You saw it and didn't tell me.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.291
Rosy.

11:05.875 --> 11:06.833
You didn't.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.458
It's a lot of white towers

11:08.541 --> 11:11.583
and it's not like I signed up
to be on this map-following squad.

11:11.666 --> 11:13.708
I'm trying to find my best friend.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.416
Not like you'd know what that's like.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.416
Rosy, he's just upset.

11:25.791 --> 11:27.000
He didn't mean it.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.875
I'll get him to apologize.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.083
Ollie. You need to ap--

11:32.166 --> 11:33.000
What?

11:33.625 --> 11:34.541
Whoa.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.333
Ollie!

11:39.333 --> 11:40.708
Y'all coming?

11:43.916 --> 11:45.791
You can't say he's boring.

11:46.666 --> 11:48.250
-Here goes nothing.
-What?

11:48.958 --> 11:50.625
-No, no, no! Zozo!
-Yahoo!

11:52.166 --> 11:54.125
This bunny's gonna get us killed.

11:59.541 --> 12:02.750
Onward to the White Tower!

12:07.458 --> 12:10.000
Wow. What is this place?

12:10.083 --> 12:11.875
A witch's cave?

12:11.958 --> 12:14.250
A sea serpent graveyard?

12:14.333 --> 12:17.125
A place where forgotten things go.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.750
Let's stay focused.

12:18.833 --> 12:20.166
Stay close.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.916
We'll get you to that tower, okay?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.666
That tower's a long way off.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.208
Got to be five miles at least.

12:25.291 --> 12:26.750
It'll take us days to get there.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.166
Hey, Ms. Sunshine,

12:28.250 --> 12:31.041
you mind being positive
for just one second?

12:31.125 --> 12:32.458
I would be positive

12:32.541 --> 12:36.250
if I didn't have to deal with
a stanky clown and a patchwork bunny.

12:36.333 --> 12:41.250
You got a problem
with a patchwork rabbit, Ms. Cactus Arm?

12:41.333 --> 12:42.166
Hey, now!

12:42.250 --> 12:43.833
Ain't no need for name-calling.

12:43.916 --> 12:45.000
Take it back!

12:45.083 --> 12:46.916
I said cut it out, both of you.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.041
Don't mind me.

12:48.125 --> 12:49.250
All I'm saying is

12:49.333 --> 12:50.541
unless Fluffy the Magic Rabbit

12:50.625 --> 12:53.125
-has a Corvette in his little backpack--

13:08.041 --> 13:09.291
You were saying?

13:21.916 --> 13:23.375
Woo-hoo!

13:33.333 --> 13:35.625
Yes!

13:36.625 --> 13:38.208
What do you see, buddy?

13:38.291 --> 13:41.833
Would you please
get your feet off my face?

13:45.250 --> 13:46.666
Woo-hoo!

14:22.041 --> 14:23.458
Momma, sing!

14:50.958 --> 14:52.583
We're here, come on! Now!

15:21.833 --> 15:23.833
Where in the heck are we going?

15:23.916 --> 15:25.291
Just follow the bunny.

15:25.375 --> 15:26.875
We've been following him.

15:26.958 --> 15:29.625
It ain't got us nothing
but tired and almost dead.

15:44.791 --> 15:48.208
Oh, look, more people
with blue pants and rubber shoes.

15:48.291 --> 15:49.416
This way!

15:57.500 --> 16:00.875
Ollie, let's go. They're attacking.
We've gotta go quick!

16:09.458 --> 16:12.416
-We gonna get to the point or what?

16:12.500 --> 16:14.250
Hey! We're looking for Billy!

16:14.333 --> 16:15.916
We're looking for a bathroom.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.166
Also important.

16:17.916 --> 16:18.916
Bye!

16:31.625 --> 16:32.916
Whoa.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.625
Sleeping Beauty.

16:46.458 --> 16:48.083
Me and Billy was here.

16:51.750 --> 16:52.916
Sleeping Beauty?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.416
You don't know Sleeping Beauty?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.875
All right. Come on, Ollie.

16:56.958 --> 16:58.041
What's next?

17:03.666 --> 17:04.500
All right.

17:08.583 --> 17:11.875
<i>Dr. Rosenwinkle, extension 142.</i>

17:52.083 --> 17:53.458
Put these on, honey.

17:53.541 --> 17:55.708
That machine's gonna get real loud.

17:55.791 --> 17:58.041
I need you to remove
all the metal from your body.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.708
-Oh, okay.
-The thing's just a big magnet.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.875
Uh, ma'am.

18:08.416 --> 18:10.958
Only family members are allowed in here.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.458
He's my son.

18:13.625 --> 18:14.750
Oh.

18:14.833 --> 18:16.041
Sorry, ma'am.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.583
Okay.

18:17.666 --> 18:19.333
He's precious.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.250
Don't you worry.

18:23.458 --> 18:26.000
This thing's just a big old spaceship.

18:26.625 --> 18:29.125
Get your momma in and out of here
in a heartbeat.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.250
Maybe two.

18:30.916 --> 18:31.833
Promise.

18:34.666 --> 18:35.625
Thank you.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.291
Okay.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.208
Can you take care of these for me? Okay?

18:43.833 --> 18:45.041
Yeah?

18:47.833 --> 18:49.583
What do we do when we're scared?

18:49.666 --> 18:51.416
-Mark Twain?
-That's right.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.958
That's right.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.583
We think of the stars

18:54.666 --> 18:56.125
and we sing our song...

18:56.625 --> 18:58.125
and we take a ride on Mark Twain.

18:58.208 --> 19:02.208
All the way to a place
where there's no fear nor pain.

19:02.291 --> 19:03.291
Hey.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.291
Just love.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.083
Dreamland.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.000
Where'd you hear that song?

20:01.083 --> 20:02.500
Momma used to sing it...

20:03.291 --> 20:05.416
whenever Billy was scared.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.708
And he is scared.

20:07.416 --> 20:09.708
And something's wrong with Momma.

20:09.791 --> 20:10.958
We gotta get back.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.083
Come on, now, don't panic.

20:13.166 --> 20:14.541
Think about it.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.333
Was there anything else?

20:18.583 --> 20:20.041
Okay. Uh--

20:20.125 --> 20:21.125
Um...

20:22.916 --> 20:27.500
Ride the Mark Twain?

20:28.166 --> 20:29.375
Wait a minute.

20:30.541 --> 20:32.583
Ride the Mark Twain?

20:33.916 --> 20:36.416
Rosy, can you get us to the roof?

20:36.500 --> 20:37.958
This boy needs some air.

20:56.875 --> 20:57.916
Come on.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.083
Now, look.

21:00.250 --> 21:03.416
I gotta get back. Momma's sick.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.750
I hear you, partner.
And I'm trying to get you back.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.375
Just take a peek.

21:09.708 --> 21:10.666
No.

21:12.291 --> 21:14.125
I don't see anything.

21:14.208 --> 21:15.708
No, look.

21:16.750 --> 21:17.958
Right there.

21:18.041 --> 21:19.208
Over yonder.

21:21.250 --> 21:24.250
Is that a Mark Twain?

21:26.375 --> 21:27.208
Yes.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.166
Oh!

21:29.750 --> 21:31.041
That's it!

21:31.125 --> 21:32.416
Hot diggety!

21:32.500 --> 21:33.500
That's it!

21:33.583 --> 21:35.625
Woo-hoo! Yes, that's it!

21:35.708 --> 21:36.750
I remember now.

21:36.833 --> 21:39.916
Billy called it "choo-choo twain"
when he was little.

21:40.416 --> 21:42.500
Daddy called this one Mark!

21:44.875 --> 21:46.125
See, Rosy?

21:46.208 --> 21:48.666
I was right to believe in Ollie.

21:48.750 --> 21:51.916
I was right to believe in his quest.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.708
We're gonna find your Billy.

21:56.375 --> 21:58.791
And we're gonna find your Nina too.

22:00.666 --> 22:02.250
We're going home.

22:03.916 --> 22:06.291
We are going home, Ollie!

22:08.166 --> 22:09.500
Woo-hoo!

22:17.125 --> 22:18.333
Let's go.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.291
No time to waste.

22:20.375 --> 22:21.458
Giddy up!

22:24.958 --> 22:27.458
That looks like a Mark Twain to me!

22:27.541 --> 22:28.791
What do you think, Ollie?

22:28.875 --> 22:29.875
Are you sure?

22:29.958 --> 22:32.208
My gut tells me it's that one,

22:32.291 --> 22:34.791
and my gut rarely lies!

22:48.500 --> 22:49.875
Rosy, come on!

22:53.708 --> 22:54.791
Rosy!

23:05.208 --> 23:06.625
Grab my ear!

23:08.833 --> 23:09.708
Heave!

23:14.916 --> 23:18.083
Now, that's what I call using your head.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.416
Maybe them ears ain't so stupid.

23:50.250 --> 23:53.666
You think it's a long ways
before we get to Billy?

23:55.083 --> 23:58.875
I figure we'll take this
to the end of the line, see what we see.

24:00.833 --> 24:03.958
Whoa, now. Elvis has left the building.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.708
Well, this is a pickle.

24:07.791 --> 24:09.958
We ain't got no needle and thread.

24:29.041 --> 24:30.041
That should work.

24:31.708 --> 24:32.625
Thank you.

24:35.583 --> 24:36.541
Ow!

24:37.125 --> 24:38.416
Hey, check this out.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.875
Zozo fixed my leg.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.041
He knows what he's doing.

24:42.125 --> 24:43.916
I was a mess when he found me.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.375
You did that?

24:45.458 --> 24:46.583
-Mm-hm.
-Ow!

24:46.666 --> 24:47.833
You keep poking me.

24:47.916 --> 24:51.041
And you keep squirming around
like a worm on a hook.

24:51.125 --> 24:52.125
Settle down.

24:53.416 --> 24:54.416
Ow.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.041
Focus on me, bunny.

24:57.208 --> 25:00.416
Why don't you tell me about your Billy?
Why is he so special?

25:01.625 --> 25:02.541
Well...

25:03.708 --> 25:06.333
he's real good at art and running around,

25:06.416 --> 25:10.166
and-- and treasure hunts,
and fort building,

25:10.250 --> 25:13.375
and karate battles with a witch,
and getting hit by lightning.

25:19.875 --> 25:21.958
He's the best buddy in the world.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.541
How long did you look for Zozo?

25:30.416 --> 25:31.583
Good as new.

25:36.333 --> 25:37.541
Ah.

25:37.625 --> 25:39.708
He was gone for a long while.

25:43.666 --> 25:45.791
I did what I had to do to get back to him.

25:48.041 --> 25:49.625
Like me and Billy.

25:51.333 --> 25:52.916
Y'all belong together.

25:59.583 --> 26:02.541
Hey, how about a song?

26:03.041 --> 26:04.958
Just like the kind we used to sing?

26:06.583 --> 26:08.375
I don't know, Rosy.

26:08.458 --> 26:11.125
I don't much feel like a song right now.

26:20.541 --> 26:21.625
Chicken.

26:41.958 --> 26:43.416
Y'all know this one?

27:12.375 --> 27:13.791
Come on, Ollie.

28:17.291 --> 28:19.625
Look. Lookie here, Orville.

28:19.708 --> 28:21.458
I found you a dance partner.

28:21.541 --> 28:23.291
Shut up, Jim Tom.

28:26.416 --> 28:27.541
Excuse me, sir?

28:27.625 --> 28:30.583
But can I put up one of my signs
in your window?

28:31.375 --> 28:33.041
I'm looking for a friend, is all.

28:33.958 --> 28:35.875
It's real important.

28:35.958 --> 28:38.375
Kid, come on now. You can't be in here.

28:38.458 --> 28:39.375
Go on now.

28:40.250 --> 28:42.750
Well, sir, I don't mean
to make no trouble,

28:42.833 --> 28:47.416
but I just can't leave here
till my sign is up in your window.

28:48.875 --> 28:49.750
Please?

28:50.416 --> 28:51.541
I said no.

28:51.625 --> 28:53.875
Herb, help me out here.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.708
It's his place. He'll tell you.

28:59.333 --> 29:02.500
Hey. You're Jimmy Wiles' kid, right?

29:03.166 --> 29:05.916
I tell you what, Jimmy Wiles' kid...

29:07.000 --> 29:11.291
if you can knock that eight ball
into that corner pocket...

29:14.458 --> 29:15.833
you can put your poster up.

29:16.708 --> 29:17.541
What do you say?

29:21.208 --> 29:22.208
I'll try.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.958
He's gonna try.

29:25.625 --> 29:28.041
I got 5 on he makes it.

29:28.125 --> 29:29.708
Like you got 5, Jim Tom.

29:29.791 --> 29:31.791
-Hey, I got 5.
-All right.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.541
Keep it down, keep it down.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.791
He's thinking.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.541
Shark in the pool.

29:57.250 --> 30:00.041
Damn, where'd you learn to play?

30:00.125 --> 30:01.375
Jimmy Wiles.

30:12.666 --> 30:15.000
We on a real adventure now, bunny.

30:15.083 --> 30:17.958
We invaded the White Tower,
found Mark Twain.

30:18.041 --> 30:20.500
Who knows? Maybe we'll see them trolls.

30:27.041 --> 30:28.583
The woods.

30:28.666 --> 30:30.541
Something in those woods.

30:31.125 --> 30:32.208
We gotta get off.

30:32.291 --> 30:34.291
We're going a little too fast for that.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.875
Just a ways more.

30:35.958 --> 30:37.500
End of the line, remember?

30:40.791 --> 30:42.166
We gotta get off now.

30:43.166 --> 30:44.583
-Again?!

30:56.958 --> 30:59.416
What in the heck was that?

30:59.500 --> 31:01.375
You nearly killed us all.

31:01.458 --> 31:05.208
I told you, we was gonna take
the train to the end of the line.

31:05.291 --> 31:07.625
I'm trying to help you, keep you safe.

31:07.708 --> 31:08.708
But you just--

31:08.791 --> 31:10.708
I can't figure you out, bunny.

31:12.250 --> 31:13.708
Oh, fine.

31:13.791 --> 31:15.750
Go ahead. Run away.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.291
Maybe Rosy was right. We should cut bait.

31:19.208 --> 31:21.041
Oh, you too, huh?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.458
I guess you think I'm a-coming.

31:30.375 --> 31:32.125
Okay, blew my stack.

31:32.208 --> 31:33.666
This one's on me.

31:34.291 --> 31:37.333
If we head back that-a-way
right around the bend,

31:37.416 --> 31:39.458
we can get right back on track.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.625
I think we are on track, Zozo.

31:45.208 --> 31:46.250
I saw them.

31:48.208 --> 31:49.166
In there.

31:50.291 --> 31:51.208
But what is it?

32:01.916 --> 32:03.208
Dang it.

32:21.833 --> 32:22.875
No!

32:25.041 --> 32:25.875
No!

32:28.250 --> 32:29.083
No!

32:54.291 --> 32:56.541
What are we looking for, Ollie?
What did you see?

32:59.083 --> 33:00.250
Is it them?

33:03.291 --> 33:05.000
The troll?

33:07.791 --> 33:09.458
Well, I'll be a...

33:09.541 --> 33:11.416
I tried to tell you.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.833
What are we gonna do about it, smart guy?

33:14.500 --> 33:15.708
I don't know.

33:16.541 --> 33:18.625
Billy and me never got this close.

33:20.708 --> 33:24.000
Okay, looks like we need a plan of attack.

33:24.083 --> 33:27.208
-Let's put our heads together now.
-Die, troll!

33:27.958 --> 33:30.458
-Rosy!
-Rosy, no!

33:35.125 --> 33:36.833
-What the hell?

33:38.333 --> 33:39.333
Ollie, stop.

33:39.416 --> 33:41.041
Die, beast!

33:41.583 --> 33:43.416
Ollie, it's made of wood.

33:45.916 --> 33:47.625
Oh. Okay.

33:51.458 --> 33:53.041
It's made of wood.

33:56.750 --> 33:58.625
Well, since it can't eat us,

33:58.708 --> 34:02.250
maybe let's climb up for a peek,
get our bearings.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Whoa.

34:37.583 --> 34:40.375
Well, Ollie? Any memories?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.041
Mm...

34:45.458 --> 34:46.333
Nothing.

34:47.625 --> 34:50.333
All right. Well, then, let's see.

34:51.541 --> 34:53.250
Dark River, check.

34:53.333 --> 34:55.291
White Tower, check.

34:55.375 --> 34:57.250
Mark Twain, check.

34:57.916 --> 35:01.458
Ollie, what's this black spot here?

35:08.375 --> 35:10.666
I... don't know.

35:13.916 --> 35:17.041
I think I know
how to get us back on track.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.916
Ollie, look.

35:22.458 --> 35:23.750
Oh, wow.

35:24.666 --> 35:27.416
-Does that ring a bell?

35:28.750 --> 35:29.875
Uh...

35:30.791 --> 35:32.125
I don't think so.

35:32.208 --> 35:33.625
Maybe if we got closer.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.833
So you know where you're going, huh, Zozo?

35:39.875 --> 35:41.375
I got a fair idea.

35:41.458 --> 35:43.458
I don't see that on the map.

35:44.833 --> 35:47.250
-I mean, it's dumb, anyways, but--
-Hey!

35:47.333 --> 35:48.833
What do you say that for?

35:48.916 --> 35:50.583
I knew there were trolls, didn't I?

35:50.666 --> 35:53.625
Ain't no troll, just a stupid statue.

35:55.916 --> 35:58.833
-I thought we was friends now, Rosy.

35:58.916 --> 35:59.958
You did?

36:00.041 --> 36:03.416
Come on now, Rosy.
Don't go sour. It's tiresome.

36:03.500 --> 36:07.000
And when you're a true friend,
you take the good with the bad.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.375
Ain't that right, Zozo?

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
I guess that's what
a true friend would do, ain't it?

36:12.083 --> 36:13.583
Y'all are talking in riddles.

36:13.666 --> 36:15.791
Right we are, and wasting time.

36:15.875 --> 36:17.125
Let's get going.

36:17.666 --> 36:18.500
Rosy?

36:19.291 --> 36:20.250
You in?

36:36.333 --> 36:37.208
Zozo?

36:39.000 --> 36:40.333
I don't like it here.

36:40.916 --> 36:41.833
You'll be fine.

36:41.916 --> 36:45.416
You got me and your faithful
warrior queen to protect you.

37:09.791 --> 37:11.958
-What was that?
-What did you see?

37:12.041 --> 37:14.958
Me and Billy, walking to school.

37:15.458 --> 37:16.791
I think we're close.

37:17.875 --> 37:19.000
Are you sure?

37:20.541 --> 37:22.083
I don't know.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.208
Now, Ollie,
we can stay out here all night,

37:25.291 --> 37:27.250
chasing something you ain't sure of,

37:27.333 --> 37:29.541
waiting for whatever's
out there in them trees

37:29.625 --> 37:32.291
to get hungry for a midnight snack,

37:32.375 --> 37:36.250
or we can keep moving
in the direction we agreed on.

37:49.625 --> 37:50.833
Let's keep moving.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.833
This way. I hear water.

37:59.166 --> 38:03.666
Ah! A sailing vessel to whisk us away
from the creatures of the night

38:03.750 --> 38:06.500
and carry us closer
to the answers we seek.

38:06.583 --> 38:07.875
-Here.
-It looks janky to me.

38:07.958 --> 38:09.541
Are you gonna keep questioning me,

38:09.625 --> 38:12.208
or are you gonna help us
get to where we need to be?

38:16.625 --> 38:18.000
Watch your step.

39:29.833 --> 39:30.875
Careful now.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.458
Where are we?

39:40.916 --> 39:42.333
Xanadu.

39:43.208 --> 39:44.666
Shangri-la.

39:45.833 --> 39:47.333
Bali Hai.

39:48.708 --> 39:52.375
A place where memories live forever.

40:00.583 --> 40:02.416
Dragon bones.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.333
And these dragons guard treasure, Ollie.

40:05.416 --> 40:09.083
If we dig deep, brave this dragon,

40:09.166 --> 40:11.333
the treasure shall be ours.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.625
I know this ain't exactly
where you wanted to go,

40:29.708 --> 40:33.416
but just bear with me until I can...

40:34.291 --> 40:36.500
illuminate the situation here.

41:13.708 --> 41:15.791
Anything here look familiar, Ollie?

41:18.250 --> 41:20.291
I don't think so.

41:20.375 --> 41:21.291
You sure?

41:21.916 --> 41:24.208
Maybe give your star a rub.

41:32.833 --> 41:34.041
How about now?

41:58.500 --> 42:01.083
Sometimes, the chemotherapy
is worse than surgery.

42:01.916 --> 42:03.333
We can't afford it, Jim.

42:04.416 --> 42:07.375
Well, I ain't gonna just
sit here and quit, right?

42:07.458 --> 42:09.125
Oh, that's what you think I'm doing?

42:09.625 --> 42:12.333
You think I'm--
You think I'm quitting, huh?

42:12.416 --> 42:15.583
-No, I didn't--
-This isn't a battle to win, Jimmy.

42:15.666 --> 42:17.583
There are no sides.

42:18.583 --> 42:20.375
There is us and it.

42:21.250 --> 42:24.541
And there's a decision that needs
to be made, and it's my decision.

42:25.166 --> 42:27.083
It's something
that's gotta be my decision.

42:27.166 --> 42:28.041
I understand.

42:30.500 --> 42:31.750
If my time is...

42:33.291 --> 42:34.750
drawing to a close,

42:35.625 --> 42:37.375
then I'd rather it be on my own terms.

42:42.958 --> 42:45.583
Me and Billy
ain't gonna just sit here and...

42:50.250 --> 42:51.333
Watch me die?

42:52.791 --> 42:54.833
I ain't afraid of saying the word.

42:59.458 --> 43:00.291
I just--

43:02.000 --> 43:05.458
I can't leave you and Billy
with bills when I'm gone.

43:05.541 --> 43:07.333
-I can't do that.
-You can.

43:07.416 --> 43:10.000
-I can't do that. No.
-No. You can't leave.

43:52.833 --> 43:54.958
-Oh, Billy.
-Momma...

43:59.083 --> 44:03.083
Do you remember
anything more about this place?

44:04.125 --> 44:06.166
-About your bell?
-No. I--

44:06.666 --> 44:09.458
I remember Billy and Momma.

44:09.958 --> 44:11.333
She is sick.

44:13.125 --> 44:14.458
It's real bad.

44:15.500 --> 44:16.333
I gotta get back.

44:16.416 --> 44:17.416
Get back?

44:17.500 --> 44:21.083
No, no. No. You're exactly
where you need to be.

44:21.666 --> 44:23.708
It's my turn for answers now.

44:26.958 --> 44:30.125
You brought me here on purpose?

44:30.708 --> 44:34.208
You-- You said you was gonna
take me back home.

44:34.750 --> 44:36.125
You lied to me!

44:36.208 --> 44:38.750
The moment I heard
that bell ring inside of you,

44:39.250 --> 44:43.041
I suspected that
you was connected to Nina.

44:43.125 --> 44:44.958
I wasn't positive, of course,

44:45.625 --> 44:47.250
but then you sang the song.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.541
And, if you know that song,
if you have that bell,

44:52.625 --> 44:57.625
then you know something about my Nina.

44:57.708 --> 45:01.583
You have your little quest,
but what about mine?

45:02.166 --> 45:04.541
What about my love conquering all?

45:04.625 --> 45:07.583
-I'd help you if I could, but--
-You have been here, you idiot!

45:07.666 --> 45:11.500
You just don't remember,
'cause your brain don't work!

45:11.583 --> 45:13.916
I never seen this place before.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.625
Not in my whole life.

45:15.708 --> 45:18.958
-I tried to do this the nice way, Ollie.
-Rosy?

45:19.583 --> 45:21.875
-I really did.
-Rosy?

45:23.250 --> 45:24.666
I'm sorry, bunny.

45:25.625 --> 45:27.041
I'd tell you to run...

45:28.041 --> 45:29.125
but it's too late.

46:08.958 --> 46:12.333
<i>A place where there is no fear nor pain.</i>

46:12.416 --> 46:13.625
<i>Just love.</i>

46:15.625 --> 46:16.833
<i>Dreamland.</i>
