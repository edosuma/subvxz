<i>How'd I end up in this?</i>

01:40.361 --> 01:42.160
<i>I'm on the way out.</i>

01:42.162 --> 01:46.130
<i>Ass looking like a black sea lion.</i>

01:46.132 --> 01:51.668
<i>A brother's life was fine until
the day my troubles started.</i>

01:58.543 --> 02:02.978
You's a fine motherfucker.

02:18.524 --> 02:20.991
<i>You see, when I got up that day,</i>

02:20.993 --> 02:22.892
<i>I had Ms in my pocket.</i>

02:22.894 --> 02:24.560
<i>Silk on my back.</i>

02:24.562 --> 02:28.196
<i>But most importantly, I had the ladies.</i>

02:28.198 --> 02:30.464
Here I come, world.

02:30.466 --> 02:32.599
Here I come.!

02:38.938 --> 02:40.604
<i>You know, it's funny,</i>

02:40.606 --> 02:43.440
<i>I thought if God wanted all
women to be happy,</i>

02:43.442 --> 02:45.708
<i>he would've made all men like me.</i>

02:45.710 --> 02:47.943
<i>You see, I had the gift of gab.</i>

02:47.945 --> 02:51.046
<i>And the smile that can book
any woman's ass.</i>

02:51.048 --> 02:53.615
What's up, Miss Lady?

02:53.617 --> 02:56.951
<i>Which one of my honeys
did I see that day?</i>

02:56.953 --> 03:00.454
<i>Yeah. First a brother
rolled up on Adrienne.</i>

03:00.456 --> 03:02.556
<i>You see, baby was a little shy.</i>

03:02.558 --> 03:05.058
Yeah, it's good.
It means you're strong.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.627
It means you're beautiful.

03:07.629 --> 03:09.328
That's right.
Really?

03:09.330 --> 03:11.630
That's right.
You're gorgeous.

03:11.632 --> 03:13.364
That's right. Put it out.
Put your head up.

03:16.168 --> 03:18.434
<i>- Hell, yeah.
- I slobbered her down.</i>

03:18.436 --> 03:20.936
<i>But look, I was just trying
to help her come out.</i>

03:25.442 --> 03:28.109
Adrienne, what are you doing?

03:28.111 --> 03:29.844
<i>Then there was Nikki.</i>

03:29.846 --> 03:33.681
What you need to be doing,
Darnell, is taking care of me.

03:33.683 --> 03:35.349
When did we establish you were my woman?

03:35.351 --> 03:37.351
When I opened my legs to you, baby.

03:37.353 --> 03:38.952
The contract was signed then.

03:38.954 --> 03:41.654
<i>Sweet honey, but she was always on me.</i>

03:41.656 --> 03:43.856
I ain't on no motherfucking contract.

03:43.858 --> 03:47.458
But you're still on the VIP list.

03:49.328 --> 03:52.195
Better be.
Get it right here.

03:54.332 --> 03:55.431
Ladies.

03:55.433 --> 03:57.032
<i>Then I stopped by to see Gwen.</i>

03:57.034 --> 03:58.266
That's your spot.

04:00.103 --> 04:01.602
Right there.

04:01.604 --> 04:04.605
Like that?
That feels so good, baby.

04:04.607 --> 04:06.106
You know, I've got to keep you happy.

04:06.108 --> 04:08.208
Looking so beautiful.

04:08.210 --> 04:10.476
Really?
Yes.

04:10.478 --> 04:12.544
Well, you know,
I've been working extra shifts,

04:12.546 --> 04:14.379
so I've been missing out
on my beauty sleep.

04:14.381 --> 04:16.714
Whatever you're doing, it's
working like a motherfucker.

04:16.716 --> 04:19.183
- Give me that foot.
- Knucklehead.

04:19.185 --> 04:21.185
<i>See, she had kids.</i>

04:21.187 --> 04:22.786
<i>They weren't mine.</i>

04:22.788 --> 04:25.054
<i>I was just trying help her out.</i>

04:26.424 --> 04:28.424
Is this...?

04:28.426 --> 04:30.525
Look at this baby.
She stinks.

04:32.128 --> 04:34.661
God.

04:34.663 --> 04:36.162
Is that her smelling like that?

04:37.865 --> 04:40.932
No, don't cry.

04:40.934 --> 04:42.466
Tee just paged me.

04:42.468 --> 04:44.768
I think something's going on
down at the club.

04:44.770 --> 04:46.870
<i>And those were just a few of my honeys.</i>

04:46.872 --> 04:50.106
<i>You see, I had a lot of them,
but nobody special.</i>

04:50.108 --> 04:51.340
<i>I loved the ladies.</i>

04:51.342 --> 04:52.641
<i>That was my problem.</i>

04:52.643 --> 04:54.509
<i>Now, my boy Tee was just like me.</i>

04:54.511 --> 04:56.077
<i>Well, almost.</i>

04:56.079 --> 04:57.311
Time.

04:57.313 --> 04:59.079
But the time is expired and so is my...

04:59.081 --> 05:00.513
What... What is all this?

05:00.515 --> 05:02.014
You're dealing with the time, baby.

05:02.016 --> 05:03.949
Step back.
'Cause you're all in my space.

05:03.951 --> 05:06.251
I want you to do me a favor.
I'm gonna give you this.

05:06.253 --> 05:08.319
Chocolate City VIP.
Yeah, whatever.

05:08.321 --> 05:10.421
Look, I got to go.
Write your number down there.

05:10.423 --> 05:12.923
Only number you're getting is
the number to the ticket office.

05:12.925 --> 05:14.691
Because I gots to go. Step off.

05:14.693 --> 05:16.426
Okay, sweetheart,
you ain't gotta be so mean.

05:16.428 --> 05:18.995
Whatever.
You still look good.

05:18.997 --> 05:20.930
I'll call you later.

05:20.932 --> 05:23.032
What's up?

05:23.034 --> 05:24.867
What'd you do, man,
you get another ticket?

05:24.869 --> 05:26.602
No, man, got the number.

05:26.604 --> 05:29.938
<i>You see, I understood him
and he understood me.</i>

05:29.940 --> 05:32.507
<i>And together we was running
this little nightclub thing:</i>

05:32.509 --> 05:34.509
<i>Chocolate City.</i>

05:34.511 --> 05:36.410
Man, I ain't giving you
a dime of my money

05:36.412 --> 05:38.178
for no damn parking ticket.

05:38.180 --> 05:40.013
Damn, Smitty, but I was working.

05:40.015 --> 05:42.115
I don't care if you was selling
oranges by the freeway.

05:42.117 --> 05:43.649
I don't pay for parking tickets.

05:43.651 --> 05:45.517
I pay your salary.

05:45.519 --> 05:48.620
I pay a damn good salary at that.

05:48.622 --> 05:51.022
Now, sit down.

05:51.024 --> 05:52.823
<i>Smitty was the owner.</i>

05:52.825 --> 05:55.592
<i>He didn't take no shit.</i>

05:55.594 --> 05:57.594
All right, man, I'm gonna give
it to you young fellas.

05:57.596 --> 05:58.995
Y'all have put some of the chocolate

05:58.997 --> 06:00.730
back in Chocolate City,

06:00.732 --> 06:02.998
but I need more chocolate
in Chocolate City.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.900
Tell you the truth, ol' Smitty
is just tired of trying to

06:05.902 --> 06:09.570
juggle this business by himself so...

06:09.572 --> 06:11.805
I was thinking about
taking on some partners.

06:11.807 --> 06:13.239
- Somebody...
- That's us.

06:13.241 --> 06:16.075
Somebody...
Right here. Us.

06:16.077 --> 06:18.177
That he can trust with the money.

06:18.179 --> 06:22.480
Every penny of his money.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.081
<i>So my life was good.</i>

06:24.083 --> 06:26.650
<i>And damn sure getting better.</i>

06:26.652 --> 06:27.951
<i>That's why when I saw her,</i> Damn.

06:27.953 --> 06:29.319
<i>I stepped to her.</i>

06:29.321 --> 06:31.754
<i>Like a moth to a flame.</i>

06:31.756 --> 06:33.989
<i>A bull to a matador.</i>

06:33.991 --> 06:37.625
<i>A dog to a cat.</i>

06:42.598 --> 06:44.196
Watch this, watch this.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.299
How you doin', baby?

06:50.136 --> 06:52.469
"How am I doing, baby?"

06:52.471 --> 06:55.138
I'm not your baby.

06:55.140 --> 06:58.407
Excuse me. Most men would've
called you stuck-up.

06:58.409 --> 07:00.242
Looking all like a Barbie doll.

07:00.244 --> 07:02.010
<i>That was it.</i>

07:02.012 --> 07:05.313
<i>The moment that changed
my motherfucking life.</i>

07:05.315 --> 07:07.748
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

07:09.084 --> 07:10.783
That's no way to talk to a lady.

07:10.785 --> 07:13.318
Madame.
Let me get your door for you.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.887
He didn't mean nothing by that.
Yes, I did.

07:15.889 --> 07:18.456
He just, you know,
fell on his head as a baby.

07:18.458 --> 07:20.324
So he's just been a little
rattled ever since.

07:20.326 --> 07:22.659
I see. Well,
maybe I should arrange for him

07:22.661 --> 07:25.595
to fall on his head again
so he can get unrattled.

07:25.597 --> 07:27.997
Baby, baby, don't let nobody
steal your joy.

07:27.999 --> 07:31.567
I would like to mend that broken heart

07:31.569 --> 07:34.102
by inviting you to Chocolate City.

07:34.104 --> 07:35.770
I wanna put you on the VIP.

07:35.772 --> 07:38.139
Chocolate City?

07:38.141 --> 07:40.741
Thank you, but no thank you.

07:40.743 --> 07:43.076
Well, I just figured,
since you in the neighborhood,

07:43.078 --> 07:44.644
if you come to the neighborhood to shop,

07:44.646 --> 07:47.446
come on and party in the neighborhood.

07:47.448 --> 07:49.247
I don't get to the neighborhood
very often.

07:49.249 --> 07:51.482
Drive on, Luis.

07:51.484 --> 07:53.383
Don't be like that.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.618
Miss Lady, don't be like that.

08:25.810 --> 08:27.943
Hold it right there.

08:27.945 --> 08:30.245
Mama.!

08:30.247 --> 08:31.879
What's happening?

08:31.881 --> 08:34.313
I told you to stop slipping
money in my pocket.

08:34.316 --> 08:36.749
Ma.
We don't need it.

08:36.751 --> 08:39.384
Your daddy's social security,
God rest his soul,

08:39.385 --> 08:40.618
does us just fine.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.187
Ma.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.891
So, what's up?
What you cooking?

08:46.893 --> 08:48.692
Well, it ain't steak.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.995
All right, Mama, you go
and eat a nasty greens.

08:51.997 --> 08:54.464
You want your son
to have some vegetables.

08:54.466 --> 08:57.667
Let's see what's in this pot.

08:57.669 --> 08:59.902
Bam. Mama.

08:59.904 --> 09:03.005
The home fries.
The homemade fries.

09:03.007 --> 09:04.840
That's what I'm talkin' about.

09:04.842 --> 09:07.075
Mama, please, not too much salt.

09:07.077 --> 09:09.644
You know what they say,
make your feet fat.

09:09.646 --> 09:11.212
So, Mama, what's up?

09:11.214 --> 09:13.714
You been, watching the talk shows?

09:13.716 --> 09:15.348
I don't watch that junk.

09:15.350 --> 09:17.316
I got enough trouble in my life already.

09:17.318 --> 09:21.119
Ma. Nah, nah, nah.

09:21.121 --> 09:23.554
- Ma!
- Hey, baby.

09:23.556 --> 09:26.056
What you doing here?
What's up, Big Head?

09:26.058 --> 09:28.625
Hey, Mama.

09:28.627 --> 09:30.360
Ma, guess what happened to me today.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.627
What? What happened?
Tell me.

09:31.629 --> 09:33.362
I got asked to the senior prom!

09:33.364 --> 09:36.298
You did?
That's so wonderful.

09:36.300 --> 09:39.034
- By who?
- None of your business.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.569
Nobody you know.

09:41.571 --> 09:43.871
What do you mean nobody I know?

09:43.873 --> 09:46.006
Look, when somebody ask
my 15-year-old sister

09:46.008 --> 09:47.707
to the prom,

09:47.709 --> 09:50.176
your brother has the right
to know with who.

09:50.178 --> 09:52.211
His name is Rodney Smalls, okay?

09:52.213 --> 09:55.147
So anyway, Mama, I was think...
Wait a minute. Who?

09:55.149 --> 09:58.116
I say "who?" Rodney Smalls?

09:59.285 --> 10:00.717
Yeah.

10:00.719 --> 10:02.552
Cleofus' little brother?
Yes.

10:02.554 --> 10:05.521
No. Y-You cancel that.
No, Mama, you...

10:05.523 --> 10:06.722
Take her out of that.

10:06.724 --> 10:09.357
Mama, do you know Cleofus' brother, he...

10:09.359 --> 10:12.360
He mack more honeys,
Mama, than... Than...

10:12.362 --> 10:13.828
The one who I'm looking at right now?

10:13.830 --> 10:16.630
Thank you.

10:16.632 --> 10:19.232
Okay. I-I picked
a bad day to come over.

10:19.234 --> 10:20.800
It's a mama-daughter jump.

10:20.802 --> 10:22.701
Okay, okay.

10:22.703 --> 10:25.103
Mama, you want her coming home
with a little... Little:

10:26.706 --> 10:28.472
Now, don't you get me started on you.

10:28.474 --> 10:31.341
Miss Jacqueline and Miss Suzanne,

10:31.343 --> 10:33.509
and Miss Rita, and Miss LaQuisha

10:33.511 --> 10:35.878
keep calling on my phone looking for you.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.614
I'm sorry about that, Mama.

10:38.616 --> 10:40.282
Darnell, you got your own phone,

10:40.284 --> 10:42.651
why you keep giving these women
my phone number?

10:42.653 --> 10:44.452
Because, Ma, if they call you,
bugging you,

10:44.454 --> 10:46.153
you're gonna tell them to go
straight to hell.

10:46.155 --> 10:47.787
You listen to me.

10:47.789 --> 10:50.856
Your ways are gonna catch up
with you one day.

10:50.858 --> 10:54.893
A night full of passion
can give you a lifetime of pain.

10:54.895 --> 10:56.561
Ain't nobody...

10:56.563 --> 10:58.596
Darnell.

10:58.598 --> 11:01.765
It's a thin line between love and hate.

11:01.767 --> 11:04.000
Ma, it ain't...

11:04.002 --> 11:06.669
Mama, I guess it's your fault, Mama.

11:06.671 --> 11:09.838
You spoiled me. Heh.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.006
You know, you loved me so good, Mama...

11:12.008 --> 11:15.275
Mia's coming home.

11:15.277 --> 11:17.777
Don't act like you're not happy.

11:17.779 --> 11:20.780
Mama, is that...?

11:20.782 --> 11:22.047
That's what this is about?

11:22.049 --> 11:24.382
No, this is not about Mia.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.117
That girl's going on with her life.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.285
This is about you, Deeny.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.553
See, now you're calling me Deeny.

11:30.555 --> 11:32.288
You ain't called me that
since I was young.

11:32.290 --> 11:35.024
So now I...

11:38.928 --> 11:40.627
Hey, man.

11:40.629 --> 11:42.362
Hey, D.
Didn't mean to lose y'all.

11:42.364 --> 11:44.197
What's happening? What's up?

11:44.199 --> 11:45.665
What's up, I'll buy now.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.800
I'm still waiting on you
to ask me to dance.

11:47.802 --> 11:50.135
Baby, I can't dance
with you till I get a chance.

11:50.137 --> 11:51.836
When you get a chance?

11:51.838 --> 11:53.771
I don't know what ho
you got me confused with,

11:53.773 --> 11:55.472
but I ain't one for you
to put to the side...

11:55.474 --> 11:58.708
Nikki, Nikki, baby, I'm...
I'm handling business first.

11:58.710 --> 12:00.710
Walk on over here.
Don't be sitting at the bar,

12:00.712 --> 12:03.112

12:03.114 --> 12:05.481

12:05.483 --> 12:07.816
Look at you. You look good,

On the dance floor.

12:17.492 --> 12:20.793
On the dance floor.

Well, then why you sitting here?

12:38.507 --> 12:39.973

12:42.911 --> 12:43.976
Look, man.

13:13.005 --> 13:16.172
She dissed you earlier,

13:16.174 --> 13:18.407
No, no. She wouldn't be here
for that, partner.

13:18.409 --> 13:21.143
She wouldn't be here for that.

13:21.145 --> 13:22.277
Man, he ain't gonna pull that.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.312
I don't know why...

13:25.782 --> 13:27.981

13:32.019 --> 13:34.319
I see you came to see me.

13:34.321 --> 13:36.621
I came to see the club.
Not you.

13:36.623 --> 13:40.857
Well, since we both here,
what's happening?

13:42.627 --> 13:45.594
Let me... Let me get you
something to drink, Miss Lady.

13:45.596 --> 13:48.229
- Sean.
- Yo, D.

13:48.231 --> 13:50.464
Give Miss Lady a glass of champagne.

13:50.466 --> 13:52.799
Coming right up.
On the house.

13:52.801 --> 13:54.834
On me.

13:54.836 --> 13:56.836
What you want, glass or bottle?

13:58.439 --> 14:01.673
I don't know what you're selling,

14:01.675 --> 14:03.975
but I'm not buying.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.349
She dissed him?

14:14.752 --> 14:16.985
He look like a sad-ass puppy.

14:16.987 --> 14:19.120
Look, Look, he's hawking her.

14:19.122 --> 14:21.889
She dissed you.

14:21.891 --> 14:23.924
Hey, hey, she dissed nobody.

14:23.926 --> 14:25.325
I got the number right here, boy.

14:25.327 --> 14:26.959
You ain't got the number.

14:26.961 --> 14:30.662
She is kind of fine, though.
Look at her shake that ass.

14:30.664 --> 14:33.665
All right, listen, I bet you
$20 you can't hit that.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.833
First of all, I ain't gonna bet
on the ladies like that.

14:35.835 --> 14:37.801
Okay? All right?

14:37.803 --> 14:40.270
You gonna have to tell her you love her.

14:40.272 --> 14:41.971
No, no.
You know that's our code.

14:41.973 --> 14:44.239
Never tell 'em you love 'em.

14:44.241 --> 14:46.407
- That's correct.
- I'm gonna hit that.

14:46.409 --> 14:48.575
- You know I am.
- Yeah, right.

14:48.577 --> 14:51.244
And when I hit it, first thing
I'm gonna do is call you,

14:51.246 --> 14:53.879
and all I wanna hear from you is:

14:53.881 --> 14:56.147
"Yo, D, you the man."

14:56.149 --> 14:59.884
I tell you what.
If you hit that,

14:59.886 --> 15:02.720
from this day on, every day I see you,

15:02.722 --> 15:05.155
I'll approach you like that.
"You the man."

15:05.157 --> 15:06.990
- We'll mack.
- She know we'll mack.

15:06.992 --> 15:09.292
I ain't no player-hater.

15:09.294 --> 15:11.160
Well, bet him.

15:11.162 --> 15:12.427
Where'd she go?

15:12.429 --> 15:14.829
She m-ma... M-macked out.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.653
That was a good one you just had.

15:25.572 --> 15:27.705
Hey, D.
Hi, y'all, what's happening?

15:27.707 --> 15:29.773
Go, have a good time.

15:29.775 --> 15:32.375
No, you ain't getting away
from me right now.

15:32.377 --> 15:34.977
No, not now.

15:34.979 --> 15:39.147
All right, come on.
Thank you.

15:42.418 --> 15:47.053
Can I please
have your... Your autograph?

15:47.055 --> 15:48.454
You're En Vogue, right?

15:48.456 --> 15:51.623
No, it ain't En Vogue, it's TLC.

15:51.625 --> 15:54.158
But, look, I'm glad
y'all came to Chocolate City.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.426

- Hey, Darnell.

15:56.428 --> 15:58.961
It's nice to come home and see

15:58.963 --> 16:00.529

16:02.566 --> 16:05.800

16:12.208 --> 16:14.575

16:14.577 --> 16:16.977
Yeah, what's up, Darnell?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.694
So how are you doing?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.662

16:45.001 --> 16:46.467
But how are you really doing?

16:46.469 --> 16:50.470
Well, now that I see you...

16:52.040 --> 16:53.906
That's cool.

16:53.908 --> 16:56.975
You're both cool?
Because I'm hot.

16:56.977 --> 16:58.876
Can we go get something to drink?

16:58.878 --> 17:01.478
Yo, what's up with the VIP?
Can we get the VIP with that?

17:01.480 --> 17:03.079
You are talking to Mr. VIP.

17:03.081 --> 17:04.380
You see the jacket, right?

17:04.382 --> 17:06.348
Tee's gonna handle that.
I gotta stay here,

17:06.349 --> 17:08.116

This way, ladies.

17:08.117 --> 17:09.617

17:09.618 --> 17:12.085
Just make sure you wait for me, Mia.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.887

17:15.890 --> 17:17.422
You promise you gonna wait for me?

17:25.531 --> 17:26.997
How you doing?

17:26.999 --> 17:30.000
Look at your ass. Looking like
a back-alley cowboy.

17:30.002 --> 17:31.501
What the fuck is up?

17:31.503 --> 17:34.036
You look like you losing weight,

17:44.279 --> 17:45.678
That's you.
No, man.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.046
That's you.

17:47.048 --> 17:49.615
Ben Vereen can flow in this,
but no. No, I can't flow.

17:49.617 --> 17:51.316
You're right.
He ordered that piece.

17:51.318 --> 17:53.217
Let me have something else.
What we got?

17:53.219 --> 17:55.219
This is a little more smooth,

17:55.221 --> 17:57.287
Show your little cuts, your walk,

17:57.289 --> 17:58.955

17:58.957 --> 18:00.957
For somebody else, but look.

Okay.

18:02.226 --> 18:05.126
Right, okay. Give me something.

You're gonna go...?

18:07.029 --> 18:08.995
Okay, okay, you do

18:08.997 --> 18:10.229
That's right.
Okay.

18:10.231 --> 18:12.164
That's right.
All right, well, let me think.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.431
Let me go to the head.
Bam.

18:15.334 --> 18:17.500
Nigga, please.

18:17.502 --> 18:19.869
This shirt is a hundred dollars, partner.

18:19.871 --> 18:21.437

Talk to me. What's happening?
Step in my office.

18:28.945 --> 18:30.644

Okay, right.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.351
Something like that.
Okay, okay. Right.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.286
Hook a nigga up.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.321
I ain't saying you gotta
pull down the pants.

18:45.323 --> 18:47.323
You don't wanna fuck with her, man.

18:47.325 --> 18:49.024
I mean, you know what I mean?

18:49.026 --> 18:51.826

You're a good, wholesome man.

18:51.828 --> 18:54.161

A living out of your truck.

19:03.537 --> 19:05.770
You fucked her?
Nah, I didn't fuck her.

19:05.772 --> 19:07.772
You were...
You were scaring me.

19:07.774 --> 19:09.206
No, I didn't fuck her.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.142
She sucked my dick though.

19:17.113 --> 19:18.846
All over that motherfucker.

19:21.750 --> 19:22.915
I love you.

19:22.917 --> 19:24.650
That's her past though.
Right.

19:24.652 --> 19:26.852
Yeah. So you gonna give me

Yo, there was some fine honeys
up in VIP last night.

19:36.862 --> 19:38.494
Except for Nikki.

19:38.496 --> 19:40.796
She got drunk, just start
claiming motherfuckers.

19:40.798 --> 19:43.431
Yeah, she did that shit
in front of Mia and Peaches too.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.967
You know what?
I got a plan formed though.

19:46.969 --> 19:48.935
Take her ass off the VIP list.

19:48.937 --> 19:51.137
Gotcha. Gotta. Gotta.

19:51.139 --> 19:54.240
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo, check it out though.

Man, why... Why you bugging, man?

20:21.628 --> 20:25.429
What you need to be worried
about is the mystery woman.

'Cause I ain't giving you
no extension on that,

20:27.466 --> 20:29.265

You've got it handled?
Ain't that about a bitch.

20:43.411 --> 20:45.844
Yeah, whatever.
Whatever.

20:54.853 --> 20:57.620

Sexier than a motherfucker.

21:01.758 --> 21:04.458

21:04.460 --> 21:06.960
With both hands.

You look beautiful.

21:18.005 --> 21:19.471
Thank you.

21:19.473 --> 21:22.340
Check it out, I bought you something.

21:25.978 --> 21:30.246
Jujubes. God, I haven't had
these in a long time.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.615
Well, figured since you coming home,

21:32.617 --> 21:34.617
brother had to hook you up, you know?

21:34.619 --> 21:37.119
Yeah, well, it's little things like this

21:37.121 --> 21:39.888

21:39.890 --> 21:42.457
Yeah?

21:42.459 --> 21:44.659
Well, look, tell me about the Air Force.

21:44.661 --> 21:46.961
Is it all it can be?

21:46.963 --> 21:49.330
Yeah. You gotta get used to it.

21:49.332 --> 21:54.000
It's a lot of opportunities
for your education, travel.

21:54.002 --> 21:55.801
I met a lot of interesting people.

21:55.803 --> 21:57.969
You mean, like, privates, what?

21:57.971 --> 22:00.738
Airmen. Is that what you mean?

22:00.740 --> 22:03.140
Airmen? I'm talking about
some of them.

22:03.142 --> 22:05.108
Top Gun-type motherfuckers.

22:05.110 --> 22:08.077
Maybe. What you wanna know for?

22:08.079 --> 22:11.779
I wanna know, what's your rush
for getting back?

22:11.781 --> 22:13.147
Wait a minute. Wa... Hold it.

22:13.149 --> 22:15.415
Let me get straight.

22:15.417 --> 22:19.284
Are you saying that the reason
I'd go back is because of a man?

22:20.387 --> 22:23.787
Right. Right.

22:25.323 --> 22:27.323
I don't believe you.

22:28.893 --> 22:32.494
Hello, Darnell? Did you hear
anything that I said?

22:34.831 --> 22:38.431
If I re-enlist, it's because
it'll be the best thing for me.

22:38.433 --> 22:39.899
Me.

22:39.901 --> 22:42.902
That's all the bro wanted
to know, that's all. Heh.

22:45.106 --> 22:47.306
Could you get the door for me?

22:57.317 --> 22:59.750
Something I can do for you, man?

22:59.752 --> 23:02.052
Is Mia here?

23:02.054 --> 23:05.121
She's busy right now, but,

23:05.123 --> 23:06.956
is there something I can help you with?

23:06.958 --> 23:10.759
I think she's expecting me.

23:10.761 --> 23:14.629
Okay then. You the chicken
delivery boy?

23:14.631 --> 23:17.531
You're a well-dressed one,
I'll tell you that.

23:17.533 --> 23:19.232
Is that you, Reggie?

23:19.234 --> 23:21.133
Yeah.

23:21.135 --> 23:24.469
I'm out here trying to get past
your little doorman.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.970
I'll be right out.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.205
Okay.

23:28.207 --> 23:31.741
No disrespect, partner.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.044
You know, you just can't be too careful.

23:34.046 --> 23:37.013
There was this chicken-delivery
rapist back in the '80s,

23:37.015 --> 23:39.181
just running around
plucking motherfuckers...

23:39.183 --> 23:42.517
Let me stop you right there.
I don't deliver chicken.

23:42.519 --> 23:45.119
My family owns Chicken Fixens.

23:45.121 --> 23:47.354
In fact, we own 20 Chicken Fixens,

23:47.356 --> 23:49.856
and netted five million
in profit last year.

23:49.858 --> 23:52.391
Should be obvious.

23:52.393 --> 23:54.626
Damn.
You banking like that,

23:54.628 --> 23:57.729
and you come over here
with a biscuit meal, man?

23:57.731 --> 24:00.230
- I mean, you...
- Hey, Reggie.

24:02.033 --> 24:03.866
There is a God.

24:03.868 --> 24:06.802
I see you two have met.

24:06.804 --> 24:09.738
Yeah. Yeah.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.239
Yeah.

24:11.241 --> 24:14.308
Look, I, I thought we'd grab a bite

24:14.310 --> 24:15.509
before we drove up the coast.

24:15.511 --> 24:18.277
I took the top down on the Porsche.

24:19.847 --> 24:21.513
Well, look, I don't wanna interrupt

24:21.515 --> 24:24.716
y'all driving up the coast
in the Porsche.

24:24.718 --> 24:29.519
Especially with your
Chicken Fixen biscuit dinner.

24:29.521 --> 24:32.288
So, I'm gonna roll on over
to Chocolate City,

24:32.290 --> 24:34.556
'cause you know I'm about
to own it, so, you know,

24:34.558 --> 24:36.324
I gotta do some paperwork over there.

24:36.326 --> 24:38.025
You know you're still on the VIP.

24:38.027 --> 24:41.894
You know, if you bring anybody
with you, please, you know,

24:41.896 --> 24:43.695
put a call in or something.

24:43.697 --> 24:46.531
And, you know, hopefully when we get

24:46.533 --> 24:48.466
some food in the club,

24:48.468 --> 24:50.367
your boy could deliver the chicken.

24:58.009 --> 24:59.041
Sh...

24:59.043 --> 25:00.342
Can I help you?

25:00.344 --> 25:01.676
What's happening, brother?

25:15.457 --> 25:17.190
What's up, man?

25:17.792 --> 25:19.024
Pass?

25:19.026 --> 25:20.358
Plant. Got one.

25:21.561 --> 25:24.028
No, there's...
Look, there's no chance.

25:24.030 --> 25:25.963
No, it's not a mistake.

25:25.965 --> 25:28.966
I... It's a sure thing,
Irving.

25:28.968 --> 25:31.468
No, don't you think.
You hired me to think.

25:31.470 --> 25:33.636
Now just trust me.
This is a good deal.

25:33.638 --> 25:35.204
Tell Irving you'll call him back.

25:38.775 --> 25:40.407
Irving...

25:42.177 --> 25:43.909
I'll call you back.

25:46.613 --> 25:49.180
Wow.

25:49.182 --> 25:51.448
You know, I have been through a whole lot

25:51.450 --> 25:53.283
to find you, Miss Brandi Web.

25:56.988 --> 25:59.054
For you.

26:02.692 --> 26:04.525
Lovely.

26:04.527 --> 26:05.792
Michael, take these out.

26:05.794 --> 26:07.360
Yes, ma'am.

26:07.362 --> 26:09.462
Call security.
I want him out now.

26:09.464 --> 26:10.796
Hold up.
Right away, Miss Web.

26:10.798 --> 26:13.298
Security?

26:13.300 --> 26:16.934
Why, you...?
Why do you gotta go there?

26:19.204 --> 26:22.538
Because you came here.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.373
I only came here because

26:24.375 --> 26:27.042
I haven't been able to think
of anything or anyone

26:27.044 --> 26:28.843
since I met you.

26:28.845 --> 26:33.414
Met? We...?
We actually met?

26:33.416 --> 26:34.915
That's what you think?

26:34.917 --> 26:37.784
That's what you call your immature play?

26:40.622 --> 26:42.989
You're joking.
You know, that's funny.

26:44.325 --> 26:46.825
Most women I know,

26:46.827 --> 26:49.194
seem to think I'm very mature.

26:49.196 --> 26:51.963
Look, you just...
This is...

26:51.965 --> 26:54.532
Don't...
This is Lalique!

26:54.534 --> 26:56.500
Of course, you don't know what that is.

26:56.502 --> 26:58.435
Get him out, please.
Is there a problem?

26:58.437 --> 27:00.470
No, no. Look,
call off your handlers.

27:00.472 --> 27:02.205
Call off your handlers, please.

27:02.207 --> 27:03.940
Give me a second.

27:03.942 --> 27:05.641
A split second.

27:05.643 --> 27:08.510
Look, obviously

27:08.512 --> 27:10.278
I made a big mistake.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.613
No disrespect intended.

27:12.615 --> 27:16.416
I met a beautiful woman,
I got beside myself.

27:16.418 --> 27:19.918
I apologize from the heart.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.153
You're forgiven.

27:22.155 --> 27:23.621
Out.

27:23.623 --> 27:26.423
Time to go, man.
Check-out time.

27:26.425 --> 27:28.358
No. I didn't mean to
knock over your Malique.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.993
Man, you're not listening.
No, I am listening.

27:30.995 --> 27:34.629
Hey, this is straight-up
on the bullshit level, man!

27:34.631 --> 27:36.764
Y'all gonna throw me out over this lady?

27:36.766 --> 27:39.500
Maybe... Maybe a brother...
Look man...

27:39.502 --> 27:40.934
I'm not trying to get on that.

27:40.936 --> 27:43.770
Man, you just fake...
Man, you a flashlight cop, man!

27:43.772 --> 27:44.804
Take it on home.

27:46.340 --> 27:48.173
- Yeah!
- That's cold.

27:48.175 --> 27:50.675
- Next.
- Fake-ass toy cops!

27:50.677 --> 27:52.343
Show how much they care about you.

27:52.345 --> 27:53.610
They ain't even give you no gun.

27:53.612 --> 27:57.380
You're flashlight cops.
I see you. I see you.

28:00.351 --> 28:03.318
Get them damn doors fixed, man!

28:03.320 --> 28:05.320
Before you start throwing people out.

28:12.161 --> 28:15.295
Hello.
Sorry I'm late.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.932
How you doing, Miss Web?

28:19.934 --> 28:23.268
Mr. Wright is in the c-car.

28:23.270 --> 28:27.271
I see.
Is he going to get out?

28:27.273 --> 28:30.307
As soon as I

28:30.309 --> 28:32.475
open the d-door.

28:39.649 --> 28:41.515
I like it.

28:41.517 --> 28:44.917
I like it. A little small,
but I like it.

28:45.953 --> 28:48.152
D-D-Do this, boy.

28:50.256 --> 28:52.990
I don't believe it.

28:52.992 --> 28:55.292
What... What are you doing here?

28:55.294 --> 28:57.060
I'm waiting for you to show me the house.

28:57.062 --> 29:00.663
And to be perfectly honest,
I don't have all day.

29:00.665 --> 29:02.331
I don't mean to be rude,
Mr. Wright.

29:02.333 --> 29:03.899
Call me Darnell.

29:03.901 --> 29:05.233
Don't mess up a brother's name.

29:05.235 --> 29:06.968
Whatever your name is.

29:06.970 --> 29:09.403
But I have a very serious
question for you.

29:09.405 --> 29:11.671
Because, you see, this is my business.

29:11.673 --> 29:13.339
Can you afford this house?

29:13.341 --> 29:15.941
Well, to be perfectly honest,

29:15.943 --> 29:18.777
I wouldn't be here

29:18.779 --> 29:21.613
if I couldn't be here.

29:21.615 --> 29:24.849
Now is this how you treat
a potential buyer?

29:28.587 --> 29:30.320
Fine.

29:32.424 --> 29:33.923
Fine.

29:36.727 --> 29:40.595
You can see that all of the marble

29:40.597 --> 29:43.965
on the countertops
was imported from Florence.

29:43.967 --> 29:46.634
Florence and Normandie?

29:46.636 --> 29:49.003
Italy, Mr. Wright. Italy.

29:49.005 --> 29:52.539
My bad. I'm thinking
Florence over by Crenshaw.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.374
You talk about...
Yeah, all right.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.542
Now, we also...

29:56.544 --> 29:58.710
This is a contemporary
Mediterranean home.

29:58.712 --> 30:00.611
I think the chandeliers are marvelous,

30:00.613 --> 30:03.814
and there are vast expanses
of land out there.

30:03.816 --> 30:07.551
How many rooms you say...
You say this place has?

30:07.553 --> 30:09.819
Fifteen. And you've seen
every square inch.

30:12.723 --> 30:15.557
And this is the final room of
the house, the master bedroom.

30:15.559 --> 30:17.425
As you can see, it has vaulted ceilings.

30:17.427 --> 30:18.959
Lovely moldings.

30:18.961 --> 30:22.162
A gas-starting, wood-burning
fireplace, that is...

30:26.434 --> 30:28.167
How did this get here?

30:30.571 --> 30:32.971
This is beautiful.

30:32.973 --> 30:33.905
It's a crystal baby bird.

30:33.907 --> 30:36.641
For you.

30:40.146 --> 30:41.879
The asking price of this house

30:41.881 --> 30:44.314
is $1.2 million
if you wanna make an offer.

30:44.316 --> 30:47.250
I'd like to offer to take you to dinner.

30:47.252 --> 30:49.552
Mr. Wright, may I explain
something to you?

30:49.554 --> 30:51.787
I have an M.B.A. from Harvard,

30:51.789 --> 30:54.089
I run my own business.

30:54.091 --> 30:55.924
There's nothing that you can buy for me

30:55.926 --> 30:57.292
that I can't buy for myself.

30:57.294 --> 30:58.760
So don't waste my time.

31:00.530 --> 31:03.030
Well, look, I can't afford this.
This is a big house.

31:03.032 --> 31:04.965
I can't afford it.

31:04.967 --> 31:06.566
I can't afford none of this.

31:06.568 --> 31:08.301
A crystal baby bird?

31:08.303 --> 31:11.203
Yeah, set a motherfucker
back like a big dog.

31:11.205 --> 31:12.604
What kind of game are you playing?

31:12.606 --> 31:14.472
I don't know.
I'm not playing no game.

31:14.474 --> 31:16.807
See, when I came at you
honest and direct,

31:16.809 --> 31:19.776
you wouldn't give me the time of day.

31:19.778 --> 31:22.312
So you tell me,

31:22.314 --> 31:24.280
what kind of game you playing?

32:25.067 --> 32:27.867
That's right.!

32:27.869 --> 32:29.969
Well.

32:29.971 --> 32:32.071
But are we safe here?

32:32.073 --> 32:34.173
Always safe, babe.
Come on now, Brandi.

32:34.175 --> 32:36.074
You in my neighborhood.

32:36.076 --> 32:38.443
You in fine neighborhood.

32:38.445 --> 32:41.479
Let's go, quickly, please.
Okay, okay.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.314
What? Not on my dress,
you know?

32:43.316 --> 32:45.316
It's greasy and everything.

32:45.318 --> 32:46.884
No, it ain't nothing but a little fish.

32:46.886 --> 32:48.719
Ain't nothing but a little fish.

32:53.624 --> 32:55.624
Peekaboo, I see you!

32:58.295 --> 33:00.795
All right.
I'm gonna try this.

33:00.797 --> 33:02.630
Why?

33:02.632 --> 33:05.332
I'm off my diet, but...

33:10.238 --> 33:12.338
This is back to my roots.

33:40.896 --> 33:42.228
Dude!

33:42.230 --> 33:44.029
Darnell!

33:44.031 --> 33:46.498
Darnell, pull in the reins!

33:46.500 --> 33:48.666
Take charge!
My God!

33:48.668 --> 33:51.168
- Motherfucker,
- Horsie,

33:51.170 --> 33:53.203
Motherfuck...!
Shit!

33:58.276 --> 33:59.875
Shit!

33:59.877 --> 34:02.510
Mother...

34:02.512 --> 34:04.645
Darnell, are you all right?

34:15.855 --> 34:18.255
Are you okay?

34:19.625 --> 34:21.824
Motherfucker cool.

34:24.362 --> 34:26.261
Why didn't you tell me you couldn't ride?

34:26.263 --> 34:28.795
Heh. I'd have told you
I could ride a monkey,

34:28.797 --> 34:30.697
if I can get close to you.
Heh-heh.

34:30.699 --> 34:32.831
You know, you could've
killed yourself out there.

34:32.833 --> 34:35.634
Hey, hey. Do I get to shoot
the horse if I break a leg?

34:36.637 --> 34:39.137
Shit. Heh. Shit.

34:39.139 --> 34:41.005
You know what the important
thing is right now?

34:41.007 --> 34:42.438
Yeah.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.174
To get right back on, right now.

34:44.176 --> 34:45.440
I ain't fucking with that horse.

34:45.443 --> 34:47.609
No, come on.
You gotta get back on him,

34:47.610 --> 34:49.643
or you're gonna get
a mind thing about it.

34:49.646 --> 34:51.846
Damn the mind thing.
You gotta try.

34:51.848 --> 34:53.013
Don't tell me that.
I don't.

34:53.014 --> 34:55.281
Just do it. Come on.

34:55.283 --> 34:58.684
The...? All right, damn.
Look at you.

34:58.686 --> 35:01.486
Now, the first thing you do...
Right.

35:01.488 --> 35:04.188
Is you mount the horse.
That means you sit on the horse.

35:04.190 --> 35:05.689
You know that.

35:05.691 --> 35:07.957
There, baby..

35:07.959 --> 35:09.658
Thank you.
Okay, you mount.

35:09.660 --> 35:11.092
Okay.

35:11.094 --> 35:12.760
This is serious business.
Okay.

35:12.762 --> 35:15.462
You get the reins, right?
Yes.

35:15.464 --> 35:17.797
After you got that...

35:17.799 --> 35:19.965
you really concentrate
on your inner thigh,

35:19.967 --> 35:21.599
right up here,

35:21.601 --> 35:23.367
right around to your behind.

35:23.369 --> 35:24.901
Around your ass?
That's right.

35:24.903 --> 35:26.936
Okay, has to be very strong.
Right.

35:26.938 --> 35:29.405
And what you do is,
once you've got the horse going,

35:29.407 --> 35:31.106
once he's listening to you,

35:31.108 --> 35:32.507
it's this motion.
Right.

35:32.509 --> 35:34.408
And that's why people don't understand

35:34.410 --> 35:36.076
you've gotta be really, really strong

35:36.078 --> 35:37.744
in your legs with the horse.

35:37.746 --> 35:39.312
Till you're up there.

35:39.314 --> 35:41.647
And you're just riding.
Right.

35:41.649 --> 35:43.515
You listen to him.
That's all you hear.

35:43.517 --> 35:44.949
He listens to you.
Right.

35:44.951 --> 35:48.652
And then you really are...

35:48.654 --> 35:51.855
You just become one with the horse,

35:51.857 --> 35:53.323
and that's when you're really safe.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.825
How do I become one with you?

35:55.827 --> 35:57.493
Come on, I just...

35:57.495 --> 36:00.295
That's what... Yeah.

36:00.297 --> 36:02.430
No, this isn't...

36:02.432 --> 36:04.165
Would you...?
Okay.

36:04.167 --> 36:05.966
That's it. That's it.
You know what?

36:05.968 --> 36:07.434
Sorry.
I wanna go.

36:07.436 --> 36:08.835
Let's just go home.

36:08.837 --> 36:10.303
Don't start that shit.

36:10.305 --> 36:12.305
This is the perfect motherfucking place.

36:12.307 --> 36:14.006
Don't start that shit.
No...

36:14.008 --> 36:15.741
What?
Hold it.

36:15.743 --> 36:18.009
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?

36:18.011 --> 36:19.910
I'm not afraid of anything.

36:19.912 --> 36:21.411
Obviously, you're afraid.
I...

36:21.413 --> 36:23.980
You bring me up here to go riding,

36:23.982 --> 36:26.482
now you don't know me because
motherfucker get physical?

36:26.484 --> 36:28.817
Stop trippin.'
Kill that shit.

36:28.819 --> 36:30.919
Look, I don't wanna be here.
I don't know you,

36:30.921 --> 36:33.788
I don't know who you are.
I don't trust you.

36:33.790 --> 36:36.390
You don't wanna be here?
You're the one that brought me.

36:36.392 --> 36:38.291
You don't wanna be here?
So you're telling me

36:38.293 --> 36:41.127
you trust a horse...
Excuse me.

36:41.129 --> 36:42.495
More than you trust this mother?

36:42.497 --> 36:43.829
That's right, that's right.

36:43.831 --> 36:45.430
Because horses don't disappoint you.

36:45.432 --> 36:47.432
People always disappoint you.

36:47.434 --> 36:50.067
Especially men, especially men.

36:50.069 --> 36:52.002
No, I don't trust you.
Please.

36:54.172 --> 36:56.939
Well, then I guess it's time
to head back to the stables.

36:56.941 --> 36:59.975
Yeah, why don't you?

36:59.977 --> 37:03.978
Please, if you buck,

37:03.980 --> 37:05.612
I'm knocking you the fuck out.

37:06.781 --> 37:09.148
Look...

37:09.150 --> 37:11.416
Don't you know this is a man's game?

37:11.418 --> 37:13.551
Look, girl, look.

37:13.553 --> 37:14.652
You know what, man?

37:16.789 --> 37:18.321
Now, you...
You gonna pull...?

37:18.323 --> 37:20.589
Don't stop.

37:20.591 --> 37:22.891
In your face!
What you gonna do about that?

37:26.296 --> 37:28.929
Heh. Hold up, because
I'm about to wear you out.

37:30.565 --> 37:32.498
You look good even when you sweat.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.100
Look at you.
How you doing?

37:35.102 --> 37:37.202
How you doing?
Fine.

37:37.204 --> 37:39.938
So, beating him?
You know I am.

37:39.940 --> 37:41.806
What time you want me to pick you up?

37:41.808 --> 37:43.641
Five o'clock?

37:43.643 --> 37:45.709
I'll be there five minutes to.
All right. See you then.

37:45.711 --> 37:47.277
See you then.

37:52.283 --> 37:53.982
You ready to finish the game?

37:53.984 --> 37:57.785
Getting a little breather
right now, is that cool?

37:57.787 --> 37:59.787
Can I do that?
What's wrong with you?

37:59.789 --> 38:01.321
Nothing, nothing.

38:01.323 --> 38:03.256
How's your little partner?

38:03.258 --> 38:07.793
I know you ain't tripping
because Reggie came over.

38:07.795 --> 38:09.461
I ain't tripping.
You ain't seen me fall

38:09.463 --> 38:12.096
no-motherfucking-where,
so I ain't tripping.

38:12.098 --> 38:13.697
You seem a little sensitive to me.

38:13.699 --> 38:15.265
Nah, nah.

38:15.267 --> 38:17.433
Can I get a swig of your canteen?

38:17.435 --> 38:18.734
Since you in the service.

38:18.736 --> 38:21.102
No backwash.

38:25.407 --> 38:27.874
Yeah!
That's what it's all about.

38:27.876 --> 38:30.209
Man.

38:30.211 --> 38:31.643
Let me ask you something.

38:31.645 --> 38:33.945
Mia...

38:33.947 --> 38:36.447
do you trust me?

38:38.050 --> 38:41.151
Yeah, I trust you.

38:41.153 --> 38:44.287
I trust you to do exactly
what you're gonna do.

38:44.289 --> 38:47.890
I know you like to sneak money
into your mama's purse,

38:47.892 --> 38:50.460
I know you like lots of women,

38:50.462 --> 38:52.562
so I trust you because I don't expect you

38:52.564 --> 38:54.697
to do anything different but be Darnell.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.301
So you just gonna
put a motherfucker in a box?

38:59.303 --> 39:00.468
Is that what you saying?

39:00.470 --> 39:02.336
I mean, you asked.

39:02.338 --> 39:05.172
<i>Hey, ladies.</i>

39:05.174 --> 39:06.640
Hi.
Welcome.

39:06.642 --> 39:09.242
Welcome to Chocolate City.
My name is Tee.

39:09.244 --> 39:11.510
Hey, Tee.
All right.

39:11.512 --> 39:14.479
We're looking for some new
dancers to fill up the club,

39:14.481 --> 39:16.881
to make the club a lot better,
you know what I'm saying?

39:16.883 --> 39:19.617
We need some, like,
stripper... I mean, exotic

39:19.619 --> 39:21.952
type, you know, dancers?

39:21.954 --> 39:24.487
So, we'll start some music,

39:24.489 --> 39:26.121
y'all gonna show me what you got, right?

39:26.123 --> 39:27.722
- Yeah.
- All right.

39:27.724 --> 39:30.057
No, y'all gonna
really show me what you got.

39:30.059 --> 39:32.325
I can't hear you. Y'all gonna
show me what you got!

39:34.128 --> 39:35.627
Give me some music, man.

39:38.164 --> 39:40.464
I want everybody to do this.

39:44.870 --> 39:47.670
Come on.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.405
I don't have a VIP card.

41:13.276 --> 41:14.675
What you mean you ain't got no...

41:14.677 --> 41:16.977
You know I ain't got no card, nigga.

41:16.979 --> 41:19.713
Well, you...
I ain't playin', Darnell.

41:19.715 --> 41:22.182
Hey! First of all,

41:22.184 --> 41:24.617
don't be loud talking to me

41:24.619 --> 41:27.386
in my motherfucking establishment.

41:32.992 --> 41:34.925
Brandi. Shit.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.499
What you doing here?

41:46.603 --> 41:47.603
Hi.

41:51.673 --> 41:55.474
Now, why would I leave my man
alone here on ladies' night?

41:55.476 --> 41:58.043
First of all, I'm not your man.

41:58.045 --> 42:00.512
Because if I was your man,
we'd be somewhere

42:00.514 --> 42:02.280
watching the sunrise.

42:02.282 --> 42:04.015
Or fucking up headboards.

42:05.351 --> 42:08.151
So I guess I'm not your man.

42:08.153 --> 42:09.785
Honey, don't do this.

42:09.787 --> 42:11.953
Please, I...

42:11.955 --> 42:13.921
You have.
You've been really patient.

42:13.923 --> 42:15.188
And it's gonna pay off.

42:15.190 --> 42:16.689
It's gonna pay off?

42:16.691 --> 42:18.157
When?

42:18.159 --> 42:19.992
When, when, when it gonna pay off?

42:23.697 --> 42:25.096
Thought so.

42:25.098 --> 42:26.430
Hey, Darnell.

42:27.866 --> 42:29.999
Hey, hey, hey.

42:30.001 --> 42:31.767
What's up, Darnell?

42:31.769 --> 42:34.202
Nice... club.

42:34.204 --> 42:36.938
Brandi, this is Mia.

42:36.940 --> 42:39.340
Mia, this is Brandi.

42:39.342 --> 42:41.408
This is Reggie.

42:41.410 --> 42:44.077
Chicken King.
If you want a wing or thigh,

42:44.079 --> 42:46.345
he can get it to you.

42:46.347 --> 42:49.348
Hi.

42:49.350 --> 42:52.584
Mia,

42:52.586 --> 42:54.686
why don't you, go on over to the VIP?

42:54.688 --> 42:56.421
I'll send y'all something over to drink.

42:56.423 --> 42:58.523
A little champagne or something.

42:58.525 --> 43:00.358
Thanks, Darnell.
All right, all right.

43:05.197 --> 43:07.931
So why don't you get me
a bottle of champagne?

43:07.933 --> 43:10.333
Hear this, and hear this good.

43:10.335 --> 43:12.301
I'm serious, all right?

43:12.303 --> 43:15.270
I'm not playing games.

43:15.272 --> 43:18.106
I need a woman in my life.
If you ain't ready

43:18.108 --> 43:19.340
to take it to that other level,

43:19.342 --> 43:21.909
stop wasting my time.

43:21.911 --> 43:24.645
Please, stop wasting my time.

44:26.096 --> 44:28.262
So look Mia, I,

44:28.264 --> 44:30.464
I hope to be spending
a lot more time with you.

44:31.767 --> 44:33.733
Reggie...

44:33.735 --> 44:36.902
I enjoy spending time with you too.

44:36.904 --> 44:39.437
But, right now I'm not looking

44:39.439 --> 44:41.739
for anything more than friendship.

44:43.676 --> 44:45.942
Well, tell me, is there...?

44:45.944 --> 44:47.643
Is there someone else?

44:47.645 --> 44:49.778
Because I'm not sure
my heart could take that.

44:49.780 --> 44:52.980
No. Not exactly.

44:56.117 --> 44:58.917
Had me scared there for a moment.

44:58.919 --> 45:00.485
To friendship?

45:00.487 --> 45:02.119
I'm trying.

45:06.258 --> 45:09.158
Get the fuck out of here,
punk-ass!

45:09.160 --> 45:10.592
Fuck, you're in my place.

45:10.594 --> 45:12.093
Man, you're in my place.

45:12.095 --> 45:13.828
Bug off, man.
The fuck!

45:13.830 --> 45:16.096
What the fuck you talking about?
Get the out of here!

45:16.098 --> 45:19.932
Come here, baby.
Get the fuck... You!

45:24.637 --> 45:27.037
Yo, man, get yourself off the dancefloor.

45:27.039 --> 45:28.638
What? What?
Hey, hey!

45:29.774 --> 45:31.874
Punk-ass!

45:31.876 --> 45:34.109
Watch your ass too, motherfucker.

45:34.111 --> 45:35.376
Back the fuck up.

45:35.378 --> 45:37.444
Yo, Tyrone, chill out
with that shit, man.

45:37.446 --> 45:39.579
What you talking about?
You're making my dick hard.

45:41.282 --> 45:43.215
It's on!

45:50.323 --> 45:51.322
Look at that.

45:51.324 --> 45:53.991
Get off of me!

45:53.993 --> 45:56.393
Push me out of my club?
Fuck that!

46:03.201 --> 46:05.534
Darnell, you okay?

46:05.536 --> 46:07.269
Yeah. Yeah, I'm cool.
I'm cool.

46:07.271 --> 46:09.437
What about you?

46:09.439 --> 46:12.540
Sure you having a good time
with the Chicken King?

46:12.542 --> 46:15.476
Excuse me.

46:15.478 --> 46:17.211
Don't let him get to you, baby.

46:17.213 --> 46:19.179
I mean, just look at him.

46:34.258 --> 46:36.058
Now that's a j-jam.

46:36.060 --> 46:39.127
Yeah.
Look,

46:39.129 --> 46:41.562
women know brothers
like to hit the skins, right?

46:41.564 --> 46:44.698
But the truth is,
women are freakier than men.

46:46.501 --> 46:49.001
If you can avoid
saying those three words:

46:49.003 --> 46:52.304
"I love you."

46:52.306 --> 46:55.173
A nigga can mack until his dick fall off.

46:55.175 --> 46:57.375
Love, baby.
Love, love. I heard that.

46:57.377 --> 46:58.743
You know what I'm talking about?

46:58.745 --> 47:00.678
Love hurts.
Right.

47:00.680 --> 47:03.047
Besides that, you know what I'm saying?

47:03.049 --> 47:06.617
If you're gonna have a woman,
you got to check 'em,

47:06.619 --> 47:08.652
keep 'em under control,
you know what I'm saying?

47:08.654 --> 47:10.654
That way...
That way what?

47:10.656 --> 47:12.789
- I'm trying to get it out.
- Y'all wait.

47:12.791 --> 47:15.057
But that way we got the woman,
is that what you said?

47:15.059 --> 47:18.060
To me...
That ain't what I'm saying.

47:18.062 --> 47:20.529
That way, you know what I'm
saying, you gonna end up

47:20.531 --> 47:22.397
waking up and shit.

47:22.399 --> 47:24.799
Under house arrest, and pussywhipped

47:24.801 --> 47:27.201
like a motherfucker, man.
Right.

47:27.203 --> 47:28.802
You see, it's about balance.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.970
You give 'em too little, they gone,

47:30.972 --> 47:34.406
you give 'em too much, heh.
You can't get rid of 'em.

47:34.408 --> 47:37.041
So you got to even it out.
You got to give 'em just enough.

47:37.043 --> 47:39.643
Just enough for the city.

47:39.645 --> 47:41.478
You know what I mean?

47:41.480 --> 47:43.847
Word. Females all the time

47:43.849 --> 47:45.949
s-sweatin' a man
about b-being a dog.

47:45.951 --> 47:47.984
And it seem like the more you dog 'em,

47:47.986 --> 47:49.719
the more they try to control your ass.

47:49.721 --> 47:51.987
And the m-more they try to
control your ass,

47:51.989 --> 47:54.189
the m-m-more pussy
they give you.

47:54.191 --> 47:56.191
Which... Whichever one
fuck the best,

47:56.193 --> 47:58.193
get to keep the man and the runners up

47:58.195 --> 48:01.496
get to hang around
and call the queen a bitch

48:01.498 --> 48:04.799
and the knight in shining armor,
a-a dog.

48:04.801 --> 48:07.835
Just a theory.
What do either of you think?

48:07.837 --> 48:09.870
Man, that's...

48:09.872 --> 48:11.705
Wait a minute.
This motherfucking beer.

48:11.707 --> 48:15.541
Does the beer make you talk
better around this motherfucker?

48:15.543 --> 48:17.509
Sound like Bryant Gumbel.

48:17.511 --> 48:20.845
This motherfucker lost
all stamina and stutter.

48:23.216 --> 48:24.515
What's that?

48:24.517 --> 48:26.984
333 Pacific Coast Highway.

48:26.986 --> 48:28.485
Boom, that's my little boo.

48:28.487 --> 48:30.520
Fellas...
Who's that?

48:30.522 --> 48:32.121
That's Brandi.
Love to hang,

48:32.123 --> 48:34.456
but I got to step.
Man.

48:34.458 --> 48:35.723
Hey!
Yo.

48:35.725 --> 48:36.857
Remember the bet.

48:36.859 --> 48:38.758
No, you remember the bet.

48:43.364 --> 48:47.365
Trust him. I just...
This is a whole new...

48:47.367 --> 48:49.767
This is the beginning of my life.

48:49.769 --> 48:51.535
This is it.
It's all new.

48:51.537 --> 48:54.271
I just have to trust, that's it.

48:54.273 --> 48:57.507
Have to really let go.

48:57.509 --> 49:01.310
Just have a good...
Fun. Fun.

49:06.650 --> 49:07.948
Fun.

49:24.798 --> 49:26.798
Baby, baby.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.232
You so fine.

49:29.768 --> 49:31.300
What's happening?

49:31.302 --> 49:32.868
Come in.

49:34.137 --> 49:35.703
Yes.

49:47.713 --> 49:50.280
Welcome.

49:50.282 --> 49:53.683
This is funky.
Thank you.

49:53.685 --> 49:56.352
You got your blue water and everything.

49:56.354 --> 49:58.287
Indigo. Yeah.

49:58.289 --> 50:00.856
Well, you can come whenever you...

50:00.858 --> 50:03.124
So would you,

50:03.126 --> 50:05.559
like some chardonnay?

50:11.867 --> 50:13.600
Yes? You would?

50:13.602 --> 50:15.268
Yeah.

50:15.270 --> 50:17.637
Got the fruit.

50:17.639 --> 50:18.871
You bad..

50:20.674 --> 50:23.241
You bad.

50:23.243 --> 50:26.343
To us, to us, to us, to us.

50:29.014 --> 50:30.947
Get a double ching.

50:30.949 --> 50:33.416
But let's do something
like this, can you?

50:33.418 --> 50:35.518
But that's...
Bring that...

50:35.520 --> 50:36.986
Ain't that for like when they do...?

50:40.957 --> 50:42.689
Lock it in.

50:47.328 --> 50:50.829
It's so good to laugh.
You make me laugh.

50:50.831 --> 50:52.530
Well, you make me laugh.

50:52.532 --> 50:54.164
Don't put that knee out there like that.

50:54.166 --> 50:56.766
Girl, I'm liable to bite that knee.

50:56.768 --> 50:58.801
Man.

50:58.803 --> 51:01.136
You look so sexy.

51:01.138 --> 51:04.372
I'm glad you came to see me.
I...

51:06.576 --> 51:08.475
I just wanted you to know that,

51:08.477 --> 51:10.810
I heard what you said tonight.

51:10.812 --> 51:13.979
And...

51:13.981 --> 51:16.181
I heard you the day we went riding.

51:17.817 --> 51:20.083
What you hear when we went riding?

51:20.085 --> 51:21.451
I just...
What you hear?

51:21.453 --> 51:23.453
But there's just a lot of things...

51:23.455 --> 51:25.354
Please listen to me.
I am listening.

51:25.356 --> 51:27.555
In my past that you don't know about.

51:28.958 --> 51:30.590
Right, well...

51:30.592 --> 51:33.593
That you don't understand.

51:33.595 --> 51:35.728
And I'm scared.

51:35.730 --> 51:37.262
Look, I'm scared too.

51:37.264 --> 51:39.597
Okay? I'm scared.

51:39.599 --> 51:42.399
You can see it in my eyes.

51:42.401 --> 51:44.934
But you have to trust me.

51:44.936 --> 51:47.102
I'm here for you.

51:47.104 --> 51:49.236
I'm here for you.

51:51.306 --> 51:52.972
You hear me when I say that?

51:52.974 --> 51:56.442
That's why I'm here.

51:56.444 --> 51:59.111
Darnell, is there someone?

51:59.113 --> 52:00.612
What?

52:00.614 --> 52:02.647
Do you have feelings

52:02.649 --> 52:05.416
for anybody?
Feelings for...?

52:05.418 --> 52:08.719
I can't even think
of nobody since I met you.

52:08.721 --> 52:10.554
Feelings? What?
What kind?

52:10.556 --> 52:14.124
Because I cannot be hurt.

52:14.126 --> 52:17.994
It would not be good for me to be hurt.

52:20.164 --> 52:22.230
I'm shocked and...

52:22.232 --> 52:23.931
You would think that I would hurt you?

52:23.933 --> 52:25.332
I just wouldn't be good.

52:25.334 --> 52:28.435
I'm not trying
to hurt you, Brandi. I'm not.

52:28.437 --> 52:31.004
I ain't trying to hurt you, woman.

52:31.006 --> 52:33.439
I...

52:33.441 --> 52:35.340
But do you want me?

52:35.342 --> 52:37.709
I want you, baby.
I-I want...

52:37.711 --> 52:39.644
Wait, listen.
I want you like a motherfucker.

52:39.646 --> 52:41.746
I want you!

52:41.748 --> 52:44.081
But do you need me?
You need me?

52:44.083 --> 52:46.550
I need you.

52:46.552 --> 52:49.486
I need you.
I need... I need you.

52:49.488 --> 52:51.754
I need you.
Need you like,

52:51.756 --> 52:52.955
need you.

52:56.827 --> 52:59.627
And do you love me?

53:12.072 --> 53:14.205
I love you.

53:17.410 --> 53:19.443
I... I love you.

53:19.445 --> 53:21.578
I love you.
Wait, please don't.

53:21.580 --> 53:23.379
Just...
No, no..

53:23.381 --> 53:25.447
I'm so scared...

53:25.449 --> 53:27.382
I'm so scared.

53:30.320 --> 53:32.219
Don't be scared.

53:35.757 --> 53:37.923
Shit.

53:37.925 --> 53:38.990
Fuck, I think we-

53:38.992 --> 53:41.559
Sh...

53:43.763 --> 53:45.796
Yeah.

53:45.798 --> 53:47.430
Who says now?

54:00.776 --> 54:04.511
Wait a minute.
Wait.

54:04.513 --> 54:06.179
I have something I have to tell you.

54:06.181 --> 54:07.580
Not now.

54:07.582 --> 54:10.349
No, it's very, very important
that I tell you this.

54:10.351 --> 54:11.717
I have to.

54:11.719 --> 54:13.118
Remember when I was telling you

54:13.120 --> 54:17.689
that I have all these
things in my past, you know,

54:17.691 --> 54:19.924
well...
Yeah.

54:19.926 --> 54:21.325
This is about my husband.

54:21.327 --> 54:23.560
You know, he was a very...

54:25.330 --> 54:27.730
Okay, he was a very abusive man.

54:27.732 --> 54:29.865
Cruel, insensitive...

54:29.867 --> 54:33.034
He shouldn't be that way.
He shouldn't be that damn way.

54:33.036 --> 54:34.036
And I killed him.

54:44.381 --> 54:45.613
I killed him.

54:47.016 --> 54:48.016
You what?

54:51.853 --> 54:53.118
Do you hate me now?

54:55.655 --> 54:57.488
Tell me.

54:57.490 --> 54:58.789
Tell me the truth.

54:58.791 --> 54:59.956
N-N-Nah.

54:59.958 --> 55:01.023
No?

55:01.025 --> 55:02.090
Why would I hate you?

55:03.760 --> 55:07.527
I mean, if he was abusive
you have to kill his ass.

55:09.197 --> 55:10.629
Yes.

55:10.631 --> 55:12.998
You understand.
Does it matter?

55:13.000 --> 55:14.532
If he was abusive,

55:14.534 --> 55:15.534
you had to kill his ass.

55:18.504 --> 55:19.736
Shit.

55:42.824 --> 55:44.323
<i>Tee's love palace.</i>

55:44.325 --> 55:45.324
Yo, yo-yo, Tee.

55:45.326 --> 55:46.425
<i>What's up?</i>

55:46.427 --> 55:48.593
What's up? What's up? What's up?

55:48.595 --> 55:50.027
Yo, what's my name?
<i>Darnell.</i>

55:50.029 --> 55:52.029
What's my name, boy.
<i>You hit it?</i>

55:52.031 --> 55:54.097
I'm the man.
That's right, I'm the man.

55:54.099 --> 55:56.966
That's right, I hit it.
Tore it up, man.

55:56.968 --> 55:58.767
<i>How was it?</i>
Hey, it was good too.

55:58.769 --> 56:01.102
Man, baby..

56:01.104 --> 56:03.304
Look, I'll explain how she work it later,

56:03.306 --> 56:05.172
but hey, I'm the man.

56:05.174 --> 56:07.841
Don't forget my name, boy.
I don't play that game.

56:07.843 --> 56:08.842
<i>Whatever.</i>
That's right.

56:08.844 --> 56:10.910
That's right.
Look, I got to roll.

56:10.912 --> 56:13.445
She might want me hit it again.
<i>Get the fuck out of here.</i>

56:13.447 --> 56:14.446
All right, okay, bye.

56:14.448 --> 56:15.780
<i>Peace.</i>
Yeah.

56:20.686 --> 56:22.318
I'm sorry.
Shit.

56:22.320 --> 56:24.153
I'm so sorry.

56:25.189 --> 56:27.189
Where did...? What you doing?

56:27.191 --> 56:28.990
You scared me...

56:28.992 --> 56:31.158
Ho-ho.

56:31.160 --> 56:32.492
So what did you hit?

56:34.395 --> 56:35.927
That was Tee.

56:35.929 --> 56:38.329
We was talking about a little
softball game back in '76.

56:38.331 --> 56:39.963
Yeah, yeah.

56:39.965 --> 56:41.731
Motherfucker, I hit a homerun.
I see.

56:41.733 --> 56:43.466
Out of the park.
You know what I mean?

56:43.468 --> 56:45.568
So tell me something.

56:45.570 --> 56:47.090
Do you think we should go back to bed?

56:48.505 --> 56:49.770
Yeah. Yeah,
why don't we do that,

56:49.772 --> 56:51.304
brother kind of tired.

56:51.306 --> 56:52.772
Okay.

56:53.975 --> 56:57.575
Hell, you go and run up on me like that.

56:57.577 --> 56:59.109
Well, you never know.

56:59.111 --> 57:00.243
That's right.

57:00.245 --> 57:01.644
You never know?

57:01.646 --> 57:02.646
Look at you.

57:30.272 --> 57:31.971
<i>I trust you.</i>

57:31.973 --> 57:33.893
<i>I trust you to do
exactly what you're gonna do.</i>

57:36.142 --> 57:38.041
Who's the man?

57:38.043 --> 57:40.109
Tell me it was worth it.

57:40.111 --> 57:41.777
Who's the man?
Yeah, all right.

57:41.779 --> 57:43.879
I want to hear it.
You the man, you the man.

57:43.881 --> 57:45.113
I'm the man. Thank you.

57:45.115 --> 57:47.081
- You the man.
- Definitely the man.

57:47.083 --> 57:49.616
Well, I gotta give it to you,
young brothers,

57:49.618 --> 57:51.217
last night's numbers look good enough

57:51.219 --> 57:52.585
for me to call my lawyer.

57:52.587 --> 57:54.887
Didn't I tell you?

57:54.889 --> 57:56.488
Chocolate City making the money.

57:58.592 --> 58:00.625
Smitty. Smitty.
Hold up.

58:00.627 --> 58:03.160
So y'all just gonna leave
me up here to do the manual.

58:03.162 --> 58:05.162
Hey, don't worry, son.
I meant what I said.

58:05.164 --> 58:07.230
Smitty, hold on, man.

58:07.232 --> 58:08.297
What is it?

58:08.299 --> 58:09.298
How's the wife?

58:09.300 --> 58:10.932
She's fine.

58:10.934 --> 58:12.300
She's what?

58:12.302 --> 58:13.934
She's fine.

58:13.936 --> 58:15.702
Come on.
You mean to tell me

58:15.704 --> 58:18.137
there don't be no little ladies
you'd like to take?

58:18.139 --> 58:20.139
You know, to look at or whatever?

58:22.710 --> 58:23.842
Wait a minute, man.

58:26.046 --> 58:27.766
Are you asking me if I creep
on my old lady?

58:29.215 --> 58:31.748
Well, back in the day you were the man.

58:31.750 --> 58:34.717
Yeah, yeah, well...
Yeah, back in the day.

58:34.719 --> 58:38.153
I was the man.
Yeah.

58:40.056 --> 58:43.557
So are you saying you don't
think that I'm the man anymore

58:43.559 --> 58:44.958
because I only got one woman?

58:44.960 --> 58:47.560
I'm sure your balls
can get a little bored.

58:47.562 --> 58:49.202
Come here, son,
let me tell you something.

58:50.965 --> 58:55.066
Ain't a day goes by
I don't see some little booty

58:55.068 --> 58:56.834
that I wouldn't mind taking a peek at.

58:58.404 --> 59:01.204
But, man, when I think about
what me and Shirley got going?

59:01.206 --> 59:02.905
Yeah.

59:02.907 --> 59:05.707
Ain't nothing...
Nothing worth ruining that for.

59:06.810 --> 59:09.944
Life is about choices, son.

59:09.946 --> 59:11.445
Older your mind gets,

59:11.447 --> 59:13.213
better choices your dick makes.

59:16.351 --> 59:17.583
Yeah, I can respect that.

59:20.888 --> 59:22.187
I've been looking for you.

59:25.725 --> 59:26.757
What my dick thinking?

59:30.295 --> 59:32.295
You can't just be coming around here

59:32.297 --> 59:33.596
fronting me like that,

59:33.598 --> 59:35.397
what's up with the limo and all that?

59:35.399 --> 59:36.798
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

59:38.535 --> 59:41.869
I like my men wearing nothing,
or nothing but the best.

59:43.405 --> 59:45.371
Can I roll with you?

59:47.608 --> 59:48.873
Sorry for the inconvenience.

59:52.612 --> 59:54.712
All right, Smitty,
I gotta roll, but look, man,

59:54.714 --> 59:55.946
my dick ain't that old.

01:00:28.672 --> 01:00:29.771
Don't worry about the club.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.239
Don't worry...
Really.

01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:34.007
You don't have to work
at the club anymore,

01:00:34.009 --> 01:00:35.441
forget about it.

01:00:35.443 --> 01:00:36.909
What you mean? I got to work.

01:00:36.911 --> 01:00:38.410
I'm a man.
Men handle their business.

01:00:38.412 --> 01:00:41.179
I know, baby, but I'll buy you a club.

01:00:41.181 --> 01:00:44.081
In New York, Los Angeles,
doesn't matter, I can afford it.

01:00:48.786 --> 01:00:49.951
Buy me a club?

01:00:51.554 --> 01:00:52.719
Thank you.

01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:54.520
Nah, I'll buy you a club.

01:00:54.522 --> 01:00:55.787
I want to do whatever it takes

01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:57.555
so we can spend all of our time together.

01:00:57.557 --> 01:00:59.256
Understand?

01:00:59.258 --> 01:01:01.091
All of it.

01:01:01.093 --> 01:01:03.993
Baby, ain't that much time in the world.

01:01:03.995 --> 01:01:07.062
We can't spend all our time
together, you know.

01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:08.763
Get a sandwich here and there.

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:11.132
Okay. Here's...
Here's what we'll do.

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.600
Why don't you take the car, drop me off,

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:14.034
go handle your business,

01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:16.502
and then come back for
a candlelight dinner.

01:01:18.973 --> 01:01:21.372
I... Well...
I'll try to get...

01:01:22.608 --> 01:01:24.007
It's my birthday.

01:01:28.813 --> 01:01:30.245
When did it become your birthday?

01:01:30.247 --> 01:01:32.447
All day long.

01:01:32.449 --> 01:01:35.616
Well, since it's your birthday,

01:01:35.618 --> 01:01:38.018
brother be back.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.152
Yeah.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:40.154
Brother be back.

01:01:52.163 --> 01:01:53.629
Yeah. Give it to me.

01:01:57.334 --> 01:01:58.334
Is that Rodney?

01:02:00.836 --> 01:02:02.435
That's his car?

01:02:02.437 --> 01:02:03.602
I don't know.

01:02:03.604 --> 01:02:04.769
And has he paid?

01:02:04.771 --> 01:02:05.836
I don't know.

01:02:08.106 --> 01:02:09.538
Mama, it's Darnell.

01:02:11.341 --> 01:02:14.275
If you think you're chaperoning
your sister to this prom,

01:02:14.277 --> 01:02:15.409
you got another thing coming.

01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:17.077
Where are you going?

01:02:17.079 --> 01:02:19.145
I just came out to see how
beautiful my sister looked.

01:02:19.147 --> 01:02:20.513
Ain't she pretty?

01:02:20.515 --> 01:02:22.915
- Look at you, girl.
- Hey... Hey, Mama.

01:02:22.917 --> 01:02:24.516
She da bomb, right, girl?

01:02:24.518 --> 01:02:26.117
Let me get this picture.

01:02:26.119 --> 01:02:27.618
Come on.
You look like a model.

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:28.852
Thank you.
Come on.

01:02:28.854 --> 01:02:30.486
Watch my hair.

01:02:30.488 --> 01:02:32.488
I ain't touch your hair, girl.
Get the picture.

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:33.956
Don't give me that stuff,

01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:36.058
act like you love each other.
Come on. Give it to me.

01:02:37.327 --> 01:02:39.827
That's wonderful.
That's so good.

01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:41.728
Yes, yes, yes.

01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:43.296
Give it to me.

01:02:43.298 --> 01:02:45.831
Mama, that's Rodney, I gotta go,
I'm not ready, come on.

01:02:45.833 --> 01:02:47.799
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll take care of it.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:00.741
What's happening, baby?

01:03:04.913 --> 01:03:06.946
It's all good.

01:03:06.948 --> 01:03:08.414
What's happening, man.
What's up?

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:10.749
Here to pick up my little
snuggle bunny, man, what's up?

01:03:10.751 --> 01:03:12.884
All right, right on, right on.
What's happening?

01:03:12.886 --> 01:03:14.452
Not much, man.
Just chilling, you know.

01:03:14.454 --> 01:03:15.753
Right. Right.

01:03:15.755 --> 01:03:17.588
So you Rodney Smalls?

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:20.424
Yeah, man. I'm the brother they
call "Rodney," man. What's up?

01:03:20.426 --> 01:03:22.826
Okay. Yeah, well, my sister's
back there, you know,

01:03:22.828 --> 01:03:24.794
just finishing up the last little touches

01:03:24.796 --> 01:03:26.162
for the prom tonight.

01:03:28.132 --> 01:03:29.898
How's your brother Cleofus?

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.066
Man, you know Cleo?
He back in the crib

01:03:32.068 --> 01:03:33.667
sitting with about 50 buck naked honeys

01:03:33.669 --> 01:03:35.635
getting physical
up in that thing, you know.

01:03:35.637 --> 01:03:37.403
I couldn't stay because
I got things to do,

01:03:37.405 --> 01:03:38.337
you know what I'm saying?

01:03:38.339 --> 01:03:40.639
Right. Right.

01:03:40.641 --> 01:03:42.273
Let... Let me holler
at you for a sec.

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:44.308
Okay, man.

01:03:46.645 --> 01:03:50.780
Look. I'm gonna get right
to the point.

01:03:50.782 --> 01:03:54.716
You treading on thin ice,
taking my sister to this prom.

01:03:54.718 --> 01:03:56.584
H-hold up,
Darnell, man, look.

01:03:56.586 --> 01:03:57.785
No disrespecting you, man,

01:03:57.787 --> 01:03:59.119
but I know where you going with it.

01:03:59.121 --> 01:04:00.820
I ain't nothing like my brother Cleofus.

01:04:02.623 --> 01:04:04.489
Look, I love my sister, I do.

01:04:04.491 --> 01:04:05.957
I love my sister dearly.

01:04:08.127 --> 01:04:09.593
Have my sister home by midnight.

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:11.595
Midnight?
Man, you got to be playing, man.

01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:13.930
Midnight, that's when everybody
get to grooving and partying.

01:04:13.932 --> 01:04:15.164
Getting their party on, man,

01:04:15.166 --> 01:04:17.399
you got to be playing with me.
Come on.

01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:19.100
I look like I'm playing?

01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:25.270
I don't give a fuck
if she lose a glass slipper,

01:04:26.406 --> 01:04:28.406
please, have her home by midnight.

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:32.409
Hi, Rodney.

01:04:32.411 --> 01:04:35.211
Hoo-hoo, lord have mercy, girl.

01:04:35.213 --> 01:04:36.545
Mama, this is Rodney.

01:04:36.547 --> 01:04:38.480
How you doing?
Very nice to meet you, Rodney.

01:04:38.482 --> 01:04:39.914
Yes, I see where she gets it from.

01:04:39.916 --> 01:04:41.415
Thank you so much.
Yes, indeed.

01:04:41.417 --> 01:04:42.816
Give you this.

01:04:42.818 --> 01:04:45.051
Mama, don't fuss.

01:04:45.053 --> 01:04:46.053
Thank you.

01:04:46.954 --> 01:04:48.653
Bye.

01:04:48.655 --> 01:04:50.521
Hey.

01:04:50.523 --> 01:04:53.290
Don't you trip. Right.
Have a good time, all right?

01:04:53.292 --> 01:04:54.758
Thanks, Dar.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.760
Have the best time you can,
baby, you look beautiful.

01:04:56.762 --> 01:04:58.228
Thank you.
Don't worry, Mama.

01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:59.629
We gonna have the best time.
Bye.

01:05:01.132 --> 01:05:02.531
You got the car washed, Rodney.

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:08.469
Her daddy be so proud.

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:10.370
I know, Mama, I know.

01:05:10.372 --> 01:05:12.205
I know she look good.

01:05:12.207 --> 01:05:13.906
You did a good job with
the hair, you know that.

01:05:13.908 --> 01:05:15.774
Yeah? Thank you.

01:05:20.146 --> 01:05:23.413
So you got yourself a rich one this time.

01:05:23.415 --> 01:05:25.114
What you talking about?

01:05:25.116 --> 01:05:27.950
Don't play me, boy.
These clothes, that limousine.

01:05:27.952 --> 01:05:30.152
I did not raise you
to be a gigolo, Darnell.

01:05:31.588 --> 01:05:33.921
Come on, Mama, I know what I'm doing.

01:05:33.923 --> 01:05:36.957
You know what you doing.
You know what you doing.

01:05:36.959 --> 01:05:38.558
Yes, I do.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.193
Well, do you know that Mia's
going back into the Air Force?

01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:59.042
But you don't want that job.

01:05:59.044 --> 01:06:01.544
Well, what do you expect?
What do I expect...

01:06:01.546 --> 01:06:04.446
Hey, I need to talk to you.

01:06:04.448 --> 01:06:06.781
Just ignore his ass, Mia,
and keep on walking.

01:06:06.783 --> 01:06:08.783
We're trying to go bowling.

01:06:08.785 --> 01:06:10.718
Well, look, let me run you down...

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.919
Let me run you down in the limo.

01:06:11.921 --> 01:06:13.954
Right quick, all right?
I'll run you down.

01:06:13.956 --> 01:06:15.722
That's all right, I'd...
I'd rather walk.

01:06:15.724 --> 01:06:16.956
I'm not talking to you.

01:06:16.958 --> 01:06:19.425
It don't matter.

01:06:19.427 --> 01:06:20.759
Look, look, look.
Let me...

01:06:20.761 --> 01:06:22.761
Let me ask you something.
Hold up. Hold up.

01:06:22.763 --> 01:06:24.796
Just... Just give
it to me straight.

01:06:24.798 --> 01:06:26.430
Is it true?

01:06:26.432 --> 01:06:27.764
You going back in the service?

01:06:29.334 --> 01:06:30.433
What do you care?

01:06:30.435 --> 01:06:32.234
What you mean, what I care?

01:06:32.236 --> 01:06:33.835
Girl, I been caring since...

01:06:33.837 --> 01:06:36.037
Since motherfucker been
buying you Jujubes.

01:06:36.039 --> 01:06:37.938
I mean, since you had
a rattle in your mouth.

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.306
I care.

01:06:44.379 --> 01:06:46.078
I'll catch up with you?

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.512
Yeah.

01:06:47.514 --> 01:06:49.547
Wasting your time, Mia.

01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:50.948
She ain't wasting her time.

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:53.050
You better stop feeding
that old negative bullshit.

01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:54.251
Know what?
Don't treat

01:06:54.253 --> 01:06:56.253
my cousin like she one
of your ho's, Darnell.

01:06:56.255 --> 01:06:57.921
Ain't nobody say nothing about no ho's.

01:06:57.923 --> 01:06:59.389
Peaches, Peaches, I'll handle it.

01:06:59.391 --> 01:07:01.924
Take care of yourself.

01:07:01.926 --> 01:07:03.425
You take care of yourself.

01:07:03.427 --> 01:07:05.260
She ain't going nowhere.

01:07:05.262 --> 01:07:06.561
Whatever.
She with this man.

01:07:06.563 --> 01:07:07.995
Stupid nigga.

01:07:07.997 --> 01:07:09.563
What?
Stupid nigga.

01:07:09.565 --> 01:07:12.432
Okay, you wanted to talk, so let's talk.

01:07:12.434 --> 01:07:14.267
What's up with the suit and the limo?

01:07:14.269 --> 01:07:15.334
I told you, you know.

01:07:15.336 --> 01:07:16.768
Me and Tee gonna change our image,

01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:18.269
because we trying to hype up,

01:07:18.271 --> 01:07:19.937
so, you know, I...

01:07:19.939 --> 01:07:21.238
We thought it might be a good look.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.240
And the limo?

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:26.708
All right, Mia,

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:28.810
this shit don't belong to me.

01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:31.345
Brandi paid for all this shit.

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:33.681
The suit, the-the limo...

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:37.084
Mia, hold on, now. Please.
Please, I don't mean to gripe.

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:38.685
I don't like that.
Hold on. Listen.

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:39.652
It don't mean nothing to me.

01:07:39.654 --> 01:07:41.620
That's why I'm here.

01:07:41.622 --> 01:07:43.521
That's why I'm here.

01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:45.989
You don't believe me?

01:07:45.991 --> 01:07:48.291
Look, I'll prove it.
Shit don't mean...

01:07:48.293 --> 01:07:49.825
I'll throw all this shit out.

01:07:49.827 --> 01:07:51.259
Who wants it?

01:07:51.261 --> 01:07:53.794
The neighborhood want this shit?

01:07:53.796 --> 01:07:55.156
I want to throw all this shit out.

01:07:57.599 --> 01:08:01.133
Brandi even bought this shit.

01:08:26.157 --> 01:08:28.823
Darnell, remember when we were kids

01:08:28.826 --> 01:08:31.693
and we used to lay in the back
of my grandma's truck?

01:08:31.694 --> 01:08:35.430
Yeah, we used to call
it a spaceship, right?

01:08:35.432 --> 01:08:40.100
Yep. And you used
to let me be the captain.

01:08:40.102 --> 01:08:41.533
Well, I had no choice.

01:08:41.536 --> 01:08:44.236
You said, "It's my grandma's,
and my grandma said"

01:08:44.238 --> 01:08:45.604
"this is my spaceship,

01:08:45.606 --> 01:08:47.939
and ladies got to have
a spaceship."

01:08:47.941 --> 01:08:49.573
What was the name of that spaceship?

01:08:50.642 --> 01:08:52.575
We called it <i> Destiny.</i>

01:08:57.781 --> 01:08:58.912
You know what was wild?

01:09:00.582 --> 01:09:03.049
I never thought I could
be with one woman.

01:09:05.153 --> 01:09:06.752
You starting to think?

01:09:06.754 --> 01:09:10.654
You...
You gonna go there on me.

01:09:10.657 --> 01:09:13.823
Here, on the romantic cliff?

01:09:13.826 --> 01:09:15.258
Look, let me ask you a question,

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:16.892
because, I mean, this is...
This is real.

01:09:16.894 --> 01:09:17.893
Okay.
Back in the day,

01:09:17.895 --> 01:09:18.895
when we were young,

01:09:21.930 --> 01:09:24.296
could I...?
Could I have had you?

01:09:29.636 --> 01:09:30.968
Maybe.

01:09:32.304 --> 01:09:33.670
If you'd been ready.

01:09:35.273 --> 01:09:36.872
I'm ready now.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.109
Think so?

01:09:45.846 --> 01:09:47.046
I know so.

01:09:50.384 --> 01:09:51.384
Come here.

01:10:23.911 --> 01:10:26.044
Are you...?

01:10:26.046 --> 01:10:27.126
Are you going to ask me in?

01:10:30.783 --> 01:10:32.263
I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

01:10:33.985 --> 01:10:35.150
What you talking about?

01:10:36.753 --> 01:10:39.086
You...
Are you saying...?

01:10:39.088 --> 01:10:41.888
No, no, no, no. No.
I wanted to...

01:10:44.325 --> 01:10:46.291
I'm thirsty, so I figure
we can go in there,

01:10:46.293 --> 01:10:47.792
drink some Fruitopia, and then plus,

01:10:47.794 --> 01:10:49.093
because I care,

01:10:49.095 --> 01:10:50.961
I want to make sure
ain't nobody in the house.

01:10:50.963 --> 01:10:51.995
I got to break 'em down.

01:10:53.999 --> 01:10:55.765
Come on. You know...

01:10:55.767 --> 01:10:57.407
You know I just don't want it to end now.

01:11:04.141 --> 01:11:05.607
All right.

01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:07.775
Yeah? What?

01:11:07.777 --> 01:11:09.710
Just for some Fruitopia.

01:11:50.783 --> 01:11:51.915
What's happening?

01:11:51.917 --> 01:11:53.549
What's happening?

01:12:13.735 --> 01:12:16.736
Don't move, all right?

01:12:16.738 --> 01:12:18.104
I'll get that.

01:12:36.086 --> 01:12:38.119
Darnell?

01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:39.753
Hold on.
Somebody selling cookies.

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:50.529
Is everything okay?

01:12:51.865 --> 01:12:53.297
Yeah, baby.

01:12:53.299 --> 01:12:55.432
I'm just, getting my change
back from the cookies.

01:13:07.644 --> 01:13:09.377
Everything okay?

01:13:09.379 --> 01:13:10.611
Yeah, everything's cool.

01:13:11.914 --> 01:13:15.748
So, let's pick up where we left off.

01:13:17.451 --> 01:13:20.285
I was thinking,

01:13:20.287 --> 01:13:21.853
maybe we should wait a while.

01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:28.058
I can respect that.
I can respect that.

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:29.559
Can a brother get some breakfast?

01:13:29.561 --> 01:13:32.228
I mean, some, grits,

01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:34.263
some salmon croquettes.
Something up in here.

01:13:34.265 --> 01:13:36.898
Yeah, I think I can hook up something.

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.766
That's what I'm talking about.

01:13:44.006 --> 01:13:45.071
Brandi.

01:13:47.075 --> 01:13:48.908
Look.

01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:50.275
I'm sorry about last night.

01:13:52.879 --> 01:13:54.344
Something really important came up.

01:13:56.681 --> 01:13:58.113
I don't know how to say this...

01:13:58.115 --> 01:13:59.514
You don't have to say anything.

01:13:59.516 --> 01:14:01.382
We had fun while it lasted.

01:14:01.384 --> 01:14:03.384
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, that...

01:14:03.386 --> 01:14:05.686
That-That's what
I was going to say.

01:14:05.688 --> 01:14:07.888
Hey, look. You know?
Maybe we just be friends,

01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:10.290
you know, be real cool,
real tight like that, you know?

01:14:10.292 --> 01:14:12.759
Couldn't agree with you more.

01:14:12.761 --> 01:14:14.761
I was starting to get very bored.

01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:17.896
Bored?

01:14:19.232 --> 01:14:21.031
That's cold.

01:14:21.033 --> 01:14:22.265
"Friends."

01:14:26.104 --> 01:14:27.436
I like that much better.

01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:34.608
Think I got something
that belongs to you.

01:14:49.522 --> 01:14:52.089
<i>So, brother moving on.</i>

01:14:52.091 --> 01:14:53.323
So a brother's moving on,

01:14:53.325 --> 01:14:55.191
that's all you got to say
after all this time?

01:14:55.193 --> 01:14:56.225
Fuck you, Darnell.

01:14:56.227 --> 01:14:58.060
You don't even deserve a woman like me.

01:14:58.062 --> 01:15:00.195
You can't even handle me,
that's what your problem is,

01:15:00.197 --> 01:15:01.829
you little weak-ass
motherfucker,

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:03.497
I don't need your
dog-ass anyway, Darnell,

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:04.899
you ain't shit.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.103
I'm-a take Marvis
to Disneyland. Look.

01:15:10.105 --> 01:15:12.038
We gonna go camping.
It's wrong, Darnell,

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.873
what you playing with people's minds.

01:15:13.875 --> 01:15:15.674
I'm not playing with nobody's mind.

01:15:15.676 --> 01:15:18.510
Especially not the kid's.

01:15:18.512 --> 01:15:20.612
It's just things didn't
work out the way I planned.

01:15:20.614 --> 01:15:22.614
Now, don't be like that.

01:15:22.616 --> 01:15:25.283
After all your damn promises.

01:15:25.285 --> 01:15:27.184
Just get out of my face, nigga.

01:15:27.186 --> 01:15:28.518
Now, don't get...
N...

01:15:30.255 --> 01:15:31.520
Roll, punk.

01:15:33.457 --> 01:15:34.856
Gwen, you gonna let your...

01:15:40.496 --> 01:15:43.096
Me and Mia, man. We...
We're making our thing

01:15:43.098 --> 01:15:45.098
a little tighter right now
and that's real.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.633
When I told you

01:15:47.635 --> 01:15:48.967
that the older your mind gets,

01:15:48.969 --> 01:15:50.535
the better choices your dick makes,

01:15:50.537 --> 01:15:53.804
I had no idea you was gonna
turn around this quick.

01:15:53.806 --> 01:15:55.038
I mean, last time I talked to you,

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.572
you was talking about:

01:15:56.574 --> 01:15:58.807
"My dick ain't that old, Smitty,
my dick ain't that old."

01:15:58.809 --> 01:16:00.341
Now you're serious.

01:16:00.343 --> 01:16:03.243
Serious as a heart attack, Smitty.

01:16:03.245 --> 01:16:05.511
You know I don't want one of them.

01:16:09.116 --> 01:16:10.748
<i>Hey, this is Mia.</i>

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:11.910
<i>Leave a message at the beep.</i>

01:16:12.751 --> 01:16:15.818
Mia. This is Darnell.

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:17.519
I know you probably out with Peaches,

01:16:17.521 --> 01:16:21.788
so...

01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:25.091
I-I was giving you a call...

01:16:25.093 --> 01:16:26.492
I was giving you a call

01:16:26.494 --> 01:16:28.494
to let you know I was thinking about you.

01:16:28.496 --> 01:16:31.230
So, get back if you...

01:16:31.232 --> 01:16:32.798
When you get a chance.

01:16:35.169 --> 01:16:36.534
Later.

01:16:57.352 --> 01:16:58.384
Fuck.

01:17:03.723 --> 01:17:04.822
You out your fucking mind?

01:17:06.559 --> 01:17:08.992
What are you doing here, Brandi?

01:17:08.994 --> 01:17:10.927
Good morning.

01:17:10.929 --> 01:17:13.262
Darnell, you scared me.

01:17:13.264 --> 01:17:16.265
What do you mean, I scared you?
What are you doing, Brandi?

01:17:16.267 --> 01:17:18.333
Well, I-I made you some bacon.

01:17:18.335 --> 01:17:20.501
And I was making pancakes,
but then I realized

01:17:20.503 --> 01:17:23.170
I didn't know whether you like
them dark, light, or fluffy.

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:25.305
You didn't know if I like 'em
light, dark, or fluffy.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.173
Brandi, get your shit

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:28.974
and get the fuck out now.
I'm not playing.

01:17:28.976 --> 01:17:31.109
Honey, you're cranky.

01:17:31.111 --> 01:17:32.510
You just need coffee.

01:17:32.512 --> 01:17:34.111
Take your biscuit batter

01:17:34.113 --> 01:17:35.545
and your fucking burnt bacon

01:17:35.547 --> 01:17:37.480
and step the fuck off, Brandi.

01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:41.317
You said you loved me.

01:17:41.319 --> 01:17:42.951
I saw how you looked
at me and you look...

01:17:42.953 --> 01:17:44.919
You just don't feel good this morning.

01:17:44.921 --> 01:17:47.321
Come on, honey, just hold me.

01:17:47.323 --> 01:17:49.723
Get your mo...
The fuck...

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:57.729
Now, stop playing fucking games

01:17:57.731 --> 01:17:59.731
and get the fuck out.

01:18:04.103 --> 01:18:06.703
You put your hands on the wrong woman.

01:18:20.118 --> 01:18:22.084
Gonna put me on the VIP list?

01:18:22.086 --> 01:18:23.385
Yeah.

01:18:23.387 --> 01:18:24.886
I don't like standing in no line.

01:18:24.888 --> 01:18:26.220
Come to the club, I'm telling you,

01:18:26.222 --> 01:18:27.821
Chocolate City...

01:18:27.823 --> 01:18:29.189
Shit. Shit.

01:18:43.238 --> 01:18:44.604
What happened to your clothes?

01:18:46.207 --> 01:18:49.307
Too much...
Too much motherfucking starch.

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:52.876
You all right?
Too much motherfucking starch.

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:54.979
You okay?

01:19:00.417 --> 01:19:01.749
I beat ya.

01:19:01.751 --> 01:19:02.783
That's cold.

01:19:02.785 --> 01:19:04.885
It is.
That's cold.

01:19:04.887 --> 01:19:06.527
Man, you wasn't even
into the game anyway.

01:19:08.156 --> 01:19:09.555
What's up, man?
What's going on?

01:19:09.557 --> 01:19:13.458
I'm caught up in a real life.

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:16.527
<i>Fatal Attraction</i>
up in this motherfucker, man.

01:19:21.565 --> 01:19:23.598
<i>Hold on, let me break this down for you.</i>

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.634
You're going through what
I call "pussy withdrawal."

01:19:27.636 --> 01:19:29.569
"Pussy withdrawal."

01:19:29.571 --> 01:19:31.537
No, see, check it out.

01:19:31.539 --> 01:19:33.138
<i>You're used to a smorgasbord of honeys,</i>

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:36.608
<i>and now you're just with Mia.</i>

01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:39.110
<i>Know what I mean?
You on lockdown.</i>

01:19:39.112 --> 01:19:41.712
I'm saying the refrigerator is closed.

01:19:41.714 --> 01:19:42.946
The lights are out.

01:19:42.948 --> 01:19:44.247
- Man.
- Hey, Darnell,

01:19:44.249 --> 01:19:45.915
the phone, man.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.085
Hi-di-ho.

01:19:50.087 --> 01:19:51.219
Hoo-hoo.

01:19:51.221 --> 01:19:52.954
Take this here, man.

01:19:52.956 --> 01:19:54.922
You ain't one of the Sylvers.

01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:57.057
Man, you better hush before
your ass get fired.

01:19:57.059 --> 01:19:58.591
I'm about to own this motherfucker.

01:19:58.593 --> 01:20:00.225
Hush. Hush the fuck up.

01:20:00.227 --> 01:20:01.359
All right.

01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:02.727
<i>Darnell Wright?</i>

01:20:02.729 --> 01:20:04.128
Yeah, this is D.

01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:05.896
<i>Yes, this is Wilshire Hospital.</i>

01:20:05.898 --> 01:20:07.530
<i>Mia Williams has been in an accident,</i>

01:20:07.532 --> 01:20:09.430
<i>she asked if you...</i>

01:20:15.203 --> 01:20:16.702
My bad.

01:20:16.704 --> 01:20:19.404
- Excuse me...
- Hey, you can't park there.

01:20:19.406 --> 01:20:20.872
What the heck's the matter with you?

01:20:20.874 --> 01:20:22.106
Learn to drive!

01:20:30.048 --> 01:20:31.147
Mia.

01:20:31.916 --> 01:20:32.916
Mia, baby.

01:20:36.053 --> 01:20:37.752
Darnell.

01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:42.055
Brandi, what...?

01:20:42.057 --> 01:20:44.223
What are you doing?
I got a call and Mia

01:20:44.225 --> 01:20:46.725
was down here in the hospital,
she was hurt.

01:20:46.727 --> 01:20:48.226
Would you have come
if you knew it was me.

01:20:48.228 --> 01:20:50.394
What?

01:20:50.396 --> 01:20:52.529
You think the hospital...
This is a game, Brandi?

01:20:57.334 --> 01:20:58.833
What happened to you?

01:20:58.835 --> 01:21:00.901
You didn't have to do that, Darnell.

01:21:00.903 --> 01:21:03.203
You know how much I love you.

01:21:03.205 --> 01:21:04.437
Excuse...?

01:21:04.439 --> 01:21:06.038
Excuse me?
Do what?

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.639
No, no, no, no,
don't-don't-don't...

01:21:09.075 --> 01:21:11.241
I'm sorry.

01:21:11.243 --> 01:21:12.942
I'm so sorry, honey.

01:21:12.944 --> 01:21:14.343
No, they made me do it.

01:21:14.345 --> 01:21:15.711
I didn't want to do it.
Forgive me.

01:21:15.713 --> 01:21:17.512
Darnell, forgive me.

01:21:17.514 --> 01:21:18.746
This is bullshit.

01:21:18.748 --> 01:21:19.747
Darnell Wright?

01:21:19.749 --> 01:21:21.248
Yeah, I'm Darnell Wright, wha...?

01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:23.450
You're under arrest.
Officer, I think you got a...

01:21:23.452 --> 01:21:26.085
You making...
You making... Shit.

01:21:26.087 --> 01:21:28.053
Please, don't hurt him.
Don't hurt him.

01:21:28.055 --> 01:21:30.021
Can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

01:21:30.023 --> 01:21:31.889
Look at this shit, Brandi.
You stop playing.

01:21:31.891 --> 01:21:33.757
I love him.

01:21:33.759 --> 01:21:36.726
This is bullshit...
He's fine, ma'am, he's fine.

01:21:36.728 --> 01:21:39.228
You gonna let me go on like this...

01:21:40.064 --> 01:21:41.496
Ouch.

01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:47.567
<i>Dr. Roderick, please call...</i>

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.670
I know you didn't touch her, baby.

01:21:49.672 --> 01:21:54.141
I raised you better than that.

01:21:54.143 --> 01:21:57.777
But you better be thankful
that they didn't press charges.

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:59.211
The lord must have been watching out over

01:21:59.213 --> 01:22:01.012
your stupid ass.

01:22:03.816 --> 01:22:06.850
Hey, I cut her off.

01:22:06.852 --> 01:22:09.652
She was on some, like,
old crazy stuff, Mom.

01:22:09.654 --> 01:22:11.820
Just wild. Buck wild.

01:22:11.822 --> 01:22:13.288
Now you see what I been telling you

01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:15.657
about these young girls
you running around with.

01:22:19.595 --> 01:22:21.094
Stay here.

01:22:21.096 --> 01:22:23.062
See, this is what I'm... Mama.

01:22:33.205 --> 01:22:34.704
Man...

01:22:34.706 --> 01:22:35.771
Mama.

01:22:36.974 --> 01:22:38.940
She done throw a brick in my shit...

01:22:38.942 --> 01:22:39.941
Hi, Darnell.

01:22:39.943 --> 01:22:41.909
You think it's a fucking game?

01:22:41.911 --> 01:22:43.076
You out your mind?

01:22:43.078 --> 01:22:44.944
You gonna throw a brick through my shit?

01:22:44.946 --> 01:22:46.478
Let me kick your shit, Brandi.
Hey!

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.512
Let me kick your shit.
Hey!

01:22:47.514 --> 01:22:49.247
How you feel about that?

01:22:49.249 --> 01:22:52.116
And then you disrespect me
in front of my fucking house.

01:22:52.118 --> 01:22:53.984
You're fucking loco.
You out your mind.

01:22:53.986 --> 01:22:55.685
First that old bullshit at the hospital,

01:22:55.687 --> 01:22:57.253
now you bring shit around my house?

01:22:57.255 --> 01:22:58.621
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:22:58.623 --> 01:23:01.256
You threw a fucking brick
through my Nissan. Shit.

01:23:01.258 --> 01:23:03.958
That's right.
That's right, I threw it.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.492
Get out the car then.
Get out the car.

01:23:05.494 --> 01:23:07.961
Honestly, if you big, bad,
motherfucking bold,

01:23:07.963 --> 01:23:09.395
you want to go ahead?
Get out the car.

01:23:09.397 --> 01:23:10.763
Yeah?

01:23:10.765 --> 01:23:12.097
Guess you're a picture of health.

01:23:12.099 --> 01:23:14.065
Yeah, motherfucking picture of health.

01:23:14.067 --> 01:23:16.901
Mr. Perfect. Mr. Lover.
Everybody wants you.

01:23:16.903 --> 01:23:18.736
That's right. That's why
the fuck you over here.

01:23:18.738 --> 01:23:20.070
Yeah?
And what are you,

01:23:20.072 --> 01:23:21.905
welterweight champion of the whole world?

01:23:21.907 --> 01:23:23.139
What you going to do?

01:23:23.141 --> 01:23:25.241
Fucking right here.
Get out, I'll show you.

01:23:25.243 --> 01:23:26.243
You try it!

01:23:27.778 --> 01:23:29.778
I'm Sugar-smokey-
motherfucking-Robinson.

01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:31.412
Honey, let me handle this.
Mama...

01:23:31.414 --> 01:23:33.814
Little mama's boy.

01:23:33.816 --> 01:23:36.249
And you better believe that
I will bust your head wide open.

01:23:36.251 --> 01:23:37.950
You don't come around here harassing me.

01:23:37.952 --> 01:23:40.352
Hi, Ma.

01:23:40.354 --> 01:23:42.921
Don't nobody mess
with my baby. Nobody.

01:23:42.923 --> 01:23:44.656
I will snatch your ass...

01:23:44.658 --> 01:23:46.624
I've been wanting to meet you.

01:23:46.626 --> 01:23:48.959
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

01:23:48.961 --> 01:23:50.060
Watch out for your son.

01:23:51.997 --> 01:23:53.129
Get on out of here!

01:23:55.633 --> 01:23:57.633
I won't have this, Darnell.

01:23:57.635 --> 01:23:58.634
Mama.

01:23:58.636 --> 01:24:00.402
I been living here 45 years.

01:24:00.404 --> 01:24:02.570
I ain't never had no shit
like this happen to me.

01:24:02.572 --> 01:24:03.737
I won't take this.

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:05.472
Now, you get a restraining order

01:24:05.474 --> 01:24:07.506
before I have to kick out
the rest of her brains.

01:24:09.276 --> 01:24:11.342
Hey, Ma...
Leave me alone.

01:24:11.344 --> 01:24:12.743
Calm down, Ma.
Leave me alone.

01:24:12.745 --> 01:24:14.478
Damn.

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.079
Yo, Tee.

01:24:16.081 --> 01:24:18.114
You ain't gonna believe this shit, man.

01:24:18.116 --> 01:24:20.483
I come to the motherfucking
precinct, right?

01:24:20.485 --> 01:24:22.785
To get a restraining order
like my Mom's asked me to do

01:24:22.787 --> 01:24:23.919
against Brandi, right?

01:24:23.921 --> 01:24:25.820
Because I don't want to hurt the bitch.

01:24:25.822 --> 01:24:28.422
That's... That's just straight,
I don't want to hurt the bitch.

01:24:28.424 --> 01:24:30.123
Right? But I go up in there,

01:24:30.125 --> 01:24:33.593
they give me no respect
in the precinct, man.

01:24:33.595 --> 01:24:37.296
You know, they laugh like,
"She trying to hurt you."

01:24:37.298 --> 01:24:39.458
They don't believe it, man.
Like I'm bullshitting them.

01:24:41.134 --> 01:24:42.134
Yo, my car.

01:24:44.503 --> 01:24:46.269
Sh... My motherfucking car.

01:24:57.647 --> 01:25:01.948
She broke my shit down
in front of the police station.

01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:04.984
She broke me down to my break pads.

01:25:04.986 --> 01:25:07.886
Look at my rear view. Shit.

01:25:07.888 --> 01:25:11.922
This... Where's the justice?

01:25:11.924 --> 01:25:13.123
Officers?

01:25:13.125 --> 01:25:14.958
Where's the fucking justice?

01:25:16.461 --> 01:25:18.160
H-h-h.

01:25:21.265 --> 01:25:22.964
This is bullshit.

01:25:22.966 --> 01:25:24.298
Soon as a...

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:26.566
Soon as a person take the law
in his own hands,

01:25:26.568 --> 01:25:27.766
he fucking wrong.

01:25:30.704 --> 01:25:32.769
And I can't fucking
go nowhere with no tires.

01:25:34.038 --> 01:25:35.038
Damn.

01:25:36.639 --> 01:25:37.804
Hey.

01:25:37.806 --> 01:25:39.972
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:39.974 --> 01:25:41.073
What's up?

01:25:41.075 --> 01:25:42.441
What's on your mind?

01:25:42.443 --> 01:25:43.442
Ain't nothing.

01:25:43.444 --> 01:25:46.144
Nothing on my mind, girl.

01:25:46.146 --> 01:25:48.246
Only thing on my mind is you.

01:25:48.248 --> 01:25:49.380
You know what I mean?

01:25:49.382 --> 01:25:50.848
Yeah, well, it doesn't seem like it.

01:25:52.451 --> 01:25:54.217
What you mean, it don't seem like it?

01:25:54.219 --> 01:25:56.385
Because a brother
like to look around, you know,

01:25:56.387 --> 01:25:58.420
Yeah.
See what's behind him?

01:25:58.422 --> 01:26:00.922
Darnell, look, I know you.

01:26:00.924 --> 01:26:04.358
And I know you're not used
to being with one girl.

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.926
You know, have you changed your mind?

01:26:12.599 --> 01:26:14.599
Only thing that I changed my mind about,

01:26:14.601 --> 01:26:15.800
is loving you.

01:26:17.937 --> 01:26:19.036
That's right.

01:26:20.639 --> 01:26:21.771
I love you.

01:26:22.774 --> 01:26:24.306
Come on, now.

01:26:24.308 --> 01:26:26.074
I love you too.

01:26:26.076 --> 01:26:27.442
You don't love me.

01:26:37.352 --> 01:26:39.018
I don't love you?

01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:40.419
Yeah, you love me.

01:26:44.757 --> 01:26:46.089
You cold?

01:26:46.091 --> 01:26:47.857
No.

01:26:47.859 --> 01:26:48.859
I'm fine.

01:26:50.394 --> 01:26:52.127
You know, I got some
blankets in the back.

01:26:52.129 --> 01:26:53.695
I was going to use them for a cookout,

01:26:53.697 --> 01:26:55.897
but you can wrap yourself in them.

01:27:04.039 --> 01:27:05.371
Yo, yo.

01:27:05.373 --> 01:27:07.239
<i>How was your little date?</i>

01:27:07.241 --> 01:27:08.607
<i>You looked cute holding hands.</i>

01:27:08.609 --> 01:27:09.741
Hey, what's up, boy.

01:27:09.743 --> 01:27:11.375
<i>Good time with your little friend.</i>

01:27:11.377 --> 01:27:12.709
<i>Get rid of the bitch or I will.</i>

01:27:12.711 --> 01:27:13.910
Yeah.

01:27:13.912 --> 01:27:15.044
Right on.

01:27:15.046 --> 01:27:16.245
<i>Get rid of her.</i>

01:27:17.414 --> 01:27:18.880
That's sure enough a write off.

01:27:18.882 --> 01:27:20.348
Tee, you wild, boy.

01:27:23.553 --> 01:27:25.185
That was Tee?

01:27:26.254 --> 01:27:28.887
Yeah. That boy wild.

01:27:28.889 --> 01:27:30.555
- Tee.
<i>- What's up?</i>

01:27:30.557 --> 01:27:31.856
I got to let Mia go, man.

01:27:31.858 --> 01:27:33.090
<i>What?</i>

01:27:33.092 --> 01:27:35.192
Brandi talking that shit
about hurting her, man.

01:27:35.194 --> 01:27:38.028
<i>Get the fuck out.</i>
I ain't going out like that.

01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:40.063
<i>Shit.</i>
I ain't letting Mia get hurt

01:27:40.065 --> 01:27:42.265
being caught up in my bullshit, man.

01:27:42.267 --> 01:27:43.933
<i>Tell her the truth.</i>

01:27:43.935 --> 01:27:45.834
<i>Even if she did believe my ass,</i>

01:27:45.836 --> 01:27:47.735
<i>she wouldn't let Brandi stand between us.</i>

01:27:47.737 --> 01:27:50.270
<i>I just care about her, man.
I care about her.</i>

01:28:09.889 --> 01:28:11.722
Hey, yo, I want you all to do my a favor.

01:28:11.724 --> 01:28:13.423
We gonna try something new up in here.

01:28:13.425 --> 01:28:17.226
I got Snoop from
Snoop Doggy Dogg's new label,

01:28:17.228 --> 01:28:21.162
Doggystyle Records. We've got...

01:28:21.164 --> 01:28:22.663
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up

01:28:22.665 --> 01:28:24.931
for L.B.C., y'all. Come on.

01:29:16.075 --> 01:29:19.609
I think we moving too fast.

01:29:19.611 --> 01:29:22.078
I think we should take a break.

01:29:27.485 --> 01:29:29.151
What are you talking about, a break?

01:29:32.923 --> 01:29:35.423
You know, I...
I just need some time.

01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:39.693
Time for what, Darnell?

01:29:39.695 --> 01:29:41.327
You playing games?

01:29:41.329 --> 01:29:44.196
Mia, I ain't playing no games.

01:29:44.198 --> 01:29:46.364
I just need some time, okay?

01:29:46.366 --> 01:29:51.435
Just...
A brother needs some time.

01:30:03.747 --> 01:30:06.481
W, this is great.

01:30:10.419 --> 01:30:12.986
Look, Smitty asked you for more chocolate

01:30:12.988 --> 01:30:15.455
than Chocolate City,
and you gave him more chocolate

01:30:15.457 --> 01:30:17.089
in Chocolate City.

01:30:17.091 --> 01:30:19.791
Vanilla sprinkled here and there. Man.

01:30:19.793 --> 01:30:20.992
Let me be straight.

01:30:20.994 --> 01:30:24.295
I need two young businessmen
like you two.

01:30:24.297 --> 01:30:25.496
What do you say?

01:30:26.999 --> 01:30:28.798
That's cool, Smitty.

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.800
Yeah, that... That's cool,
man.

01:30:32.103 --> 01:30:33.969
Wait, before you go. Wait.

01:30:33.971 --> 01:30:35.770
I offer you a piece of my empire,

01:30:35.772 --> 01:30:39.306
and all you can say is,
"It's cool."

01:30:39.308 --> 01:30:41.808
No, it's just right now
I got some things on my mind.

01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:44.410
Somebody that I'm dealing with.
But I'm telling you, it's cool.

01:30:44.412 --> 01:30:46.245
I... I mean, how am I gonna say
no to a partnership, man?

01:30:46.247 --> 01:30:47.746
Come on, now.

01:30:47.748 --> 01:30:49.414
Yo, Smitty, we need you over at the bar.

01:30:49.416 --> 01:30:50.782
All right. Hey, look.

01:30:50.784 --> 01:30:53.751
Me, you, Tee, lunch, tomorrow,
to discuss it with tickets.

01:30:53.753 --> 01:30:55.319
All right.

01:32:45.484 --> 01:32:47.250
What the fuck are you doing?

01:32:47.252 --> 01:32:49.051
I'm looking for Darnell.
Is he here?

01:32:49.053 --> 01:32:52.454
Darnell? T, it's over
between me and Darnell.

01:32:52.456 --> 01:32:55.123
What's wrong? We got an
emergency at the club.

01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:56.791
I need to see him.
That's your problem.

01:32:56.793 --> 01:32:58.492
After the way Darnell dogged Mia out, no.

01:32:58.494 --> 01:32:59.759
First of all,

01:32:59.761 --> 01:33:01.827
He did not dog Mia out.

01:33:01.829 --> 01:33:03.428
It's that crazy bitch Brandi that said

01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:05.163
she was gonna do something to you.

01:33:05.165 --> 01:33:06.731
So he had to do what he had to do.

01:33:06.733 --> 01:33:08.365
You know what I'm saying?
Anyway,

01:33:08.367 --> 01:33:10.400
do you wanna come with me
so we can try to find him?

01:33:10.402 --> 01:33:12.802
Yeah, T, come on in.

01:33:12.804 --> 01:33:15.371
D-D-Darnell!
S-stop, stop!

01:33:15.373 --> 01:33:17.873
G...!

01:33:17.875 --> 01:33:19.774
P-put your window down,
man.

01:33:19.776 --> 01:33:20.875
Now, you see any damn windows

01:33:20.877 --> 01:33:22.810
in the front of this car, man?

01:33:22.812 --> 01:33:27.447
We g-gotta g-get to the club,
man.

01:33:30.885 --> 01:33:34.453
Shit!
Look at this, D.W.

01:33:34.455 --> 01:33:36.655
Man, I've been in this business
for 15 years.

01:33:36.657 --> 01:33:38.657
Now, maybe I should know better,

01:33:38.659 --> 01:33:40.158
but could you tell me how one minute

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:42.026
I can have people partying in my club,

01:33:42.028 --> 01:33:44.128
and the next minute, I got water damage,

01:33:44.130 --> 01:33:45.896
fire damage, smoke damage.

01:33:45.898 --> 01:33:48.965
Man, this is some freaky shit.

01:33:48.967 --> 01:33:50.266
If I didn't know better,

01:33:50.268 --> 01:33:54.036
I would think that somebody
was trying to ruin me.

01:33:54.038 --> 01:33:56.204
Look, Smitty, just calm down, all right?

01:33:56.206 --> 01:33:57.605
I think I know who did this.

01:33:57.607 --> 01:33:59.440
Look, look, look.

01:33:59.442 --> 01:34:00.908
I know who did it.

01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:02.376
What do you mean, you know who did it?

01:34:02.378 --> 01:34:04.277
I think I know who did it.

01:34:04.279 --> 01:34:05.978
Hold it, hold it, wait a minute, son.

01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:09.281
Trust me on this one,
Smitty. Damn. Trust me.

01:34:16.690 --> 01:34:17.922
He's gonna kill that bitch.

01:34:17.924 --> 01:34:19.924
Do you know where she lives?
Yeah, hell, yeah.

01:34:19.926 --> 01:34:21.292
Well, then, let's go find him.

01:34:21.294 --> 01:34:23.127
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you guys going?

01:34:23.129 --> 01:34:25.095
I'm going to find Darnell.

01:34:33.638 --> 01:34:35.604
Brandi!

01:34:35.606 --> 01:34:38.239
Brandi, where the fuck are you?!

01:34:38.241 --> 01:34:39.673
Brandi...

01:34:48.182 --> 01:34:50.048
Are you sure it's down this far?

01:34:50.050 --> 01:34:51.682
I hope so.

01:34:51.684 --> 01:34:54.184
Tell me something, Darnell.

01:34:54.186 --> 01:34:55.851
You still a man?

01:34:58.455 --> 01:35:01.756
The main man.

01:35:05.528 --> 01:35:06.693
You know what you are?

01:35:09.964 --> 01:35:11.762
And I didn't think so.

01:35:14.199 --> 01:35:15.364
You're a dog.

01:35:16.967 --> 01:35:19.867
You're a mad dog, to be exact.

01:35:19.869 --> 01:35:23.770
And do you know what they do
with mad dogs?

01:35:23.772 --> 01:35:25.505
I can't hear you.

01:35:25.507 --> 01:35:27.039
No, what they do with mad dogs?

01:35:27.041 --> 01:35:29.006
They shoot mad dogs.

01:35:31.744 --> 01:35:34.544
But I'm not gonna shoot you.

01:35:34.546 --> 01:35:36.445
Not for myself.

01:35:36.447 --> 01:35:41.316
No, I'm gonna shoot you for all women.

01:35:42.852 --> 01:35:44.817
But first, darling...

01:35:47.254 --> 01:35:48.886
look at that.

01:35:48.888 --> 01:35:51.121
We gonna have my birthday cake.

01:35:56.092 --> 01:35:58.125
Shit!

01:35:59.161 --> 01:36:00.426
Know what?

01:36:00.428 --> 01:36:02.094
You fucked with the wrong one.

01:36:05.432 --> 01:36:06.432
You know something?

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:10.267
A man just comes along

01:36:10.269 --> 01:36:13.169
and he buys us off a shelf

01:36:13.171 --> 01:36:14.603
and he plays with us.

01:36:14.605 --> 01:36:17.405
Plays with us until he thinks
we're no longer fun

01:36:17.407 --> 01:36:19.740
or he gets us all dirty, right?

01:36:21.777 --> 01:36:24.911
Then he wants to just throw us away.

01:36:24.913 --> 01:36:26.913
And you know what?
Let me tell you something...

01:36:26.915 --> 01:36:28.214
Mr. Player,

01:36:28.216 --> 01:36:30.316
Mr. Pimp,
Mr. Great Big Daddy.

01:36:30.318 --> 01:36:33.152
We are tired of being your boy toys.

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.321
Let go of me.
We gone too through

01:36:36.323 --> 01:36:37.689
with your lies

01:36:37.691 --> 01:36:41.025
and your wandering eyes.

01:36:41.027 --> 01:36:43.827
Yes, and let me tell you something.

01:36:43.829 --> 01:36:45.628
We're not your bitches, your hookers,

01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:47.763
your whores or your honeys.

01:36:47.765 --> 01:36:49.297
And you know what?

01:36:49.299 --> 01:36:53.333
We do just fine without
your dick or your money.

01:36:55.103 --> 01:36:56.302
So fucking crazy.

01:36:56.304 --> 01:36:57.770
So you see,

01:36:59.039 --> 01:37:01.906
you can't have your cake and eat it too.

01:37:01.908 --> 01:37:03.607
You're out your fucking mind.
Hey!

01:37:03.609 --> 01:37:05.642
Let's retire upstairs.
Yeah, you fucking crazy.

01:37:05.644 --> 01:37:07.276
Shut up!
You fucking...

01:37:10.748 --> 01:37:13.115
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:37:13.117 --> 01:37:15.183
Did that hurt?

01:37:17.854 --> 01:37:19.453
Fuck you, Brandi.

01:37:19.455 --> 01:37:21.755
Fuck you, bitch!

01:37:21.757 --> 01:37:24.190
I don't know how the fuck
you gonna get me upstairs?

01:37:24.192 --> 01:37:25.925
'Cause I ain't walking
up that motherfucker.

01:37:25.927 --> 01:37:26.927
You're not?

01:37:31.532 --> 01:37:33.264
Move it...

01:37:36.068 --> 01:37:37.333
Move it!

01:37:41.004 --> 01:37:42.636
This thing hurt!

01:37:46.975 --> 01:37:49.241
You know, Darnell,

01:37:49.243 --> 01:37:53.411
it's funny how men cooperate
when you lock in on their nuts.

01:37:53.413 --> 01:37:56.147
Of course, I prefer
the word "testicles."

01:37:58.251 --> 01:37:59.817
Tee, that's 333 right there.

01:37:59.819 --> 01:38:01.585
All right, I got it.

01:38:01.587 --> 01:38:03.853
Hold on.

01:38:03.855 --> 01:38:04.855
Yeah.

01:38:10.594 --> 01:38:11.993
Get in the tub.

01:38:11.995 --> 01:38:13.461
I ain't getting in no motherfucking tub.

01:38:13.463 --> 01:38:14.562
Get in the tub!

01:38:25.137 --> 01:38:26.137
So...

01:38:29.006 --> 01:38:31.406
we have anything to say, Darnell?

01:38:31.408 --> 01:38:34.509
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:34.511 --> 01:38:36.444
I motherfucking apologize.

01:38:36.446 --> 01:38:38.145
Shit!

01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:48.319
I apologize.

01:38:48.321 --> 01:38:51.689
But there ain't no need
to kill a nigger over this shit.

01:38:59.465 --> 01:39:02.165
I wasn't always like this, was I?

01:39:02.167 --> 01:39:05.835
I was a good girl.
I... I am.

01:39:05.837 --> 01:39:09.238
I just married the wrong man
for all the right reasons.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.339
Did you shoot his ass too?

01:39:13.576 --> 01:39:15.576
Of course,

01:39:15.578 --> 01:39:18.145
his woman was a blond

01:39:18.147 --> 01:39:20.313
and yours was a nappy head.

01:39:20.315 --> 01:39:23.549
But I trusted you
just like I trusted him.

01:39:23.551 --> 01:39:25.751
You can still trust me.

01:39:25.753 --> 01:39:27.252
You can still trust me.

01:39:27.254 --> 01:39:30.221
And he just smiled,

01:39:30.223 --> 01:39:31.388
smirked,

01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:34.090
When I caught his ass
pouncing up and down

01:39:34.092 --> 01:39:36.058
in my bed with some bimbo...

01:39:41.097 --> 01:39:43.230
it was amazing how he changed.

01:39:43.232 --> 01:39:45.265
It was just amazing when he realized

01:39:45.267 --> 01:39:48.033
I was about to electrocute his ass.

01:39:59.110 --> 01:40:01.610
You still think this is a game,
you motherfucker?

01:40:05.315 --> 01:40:06.681
Shit...

01:40:12.555 --> 01:40:13.687
Just be quiet.

01:40:21.429 --> 01:40:22.528
<i>911.</i>

01:40:22.530 --> 01:40:26.397
911, there's an emergency over here.

01:40:26.399 --> 01:40:27.431
I'm trying to keep...

01:40:33.404 --> 01:40:35.604
Shit.

01:40:35.606 --> 01:40:36.606
Tee.

01:40:44.812 --> 01:40:46.845
Get your ass up.

01:40:49.449 --> 01:40:51.282
Where's Darnell?

01:40:51.284 --> 01:40:52.883
Get upstairs.

01:40:56.088 --> 01:40:57.554
Get!

01:40:57.556 --> 01:41:00.890
All right, just calm down.
Just chill, all right?

01:41:02.026 --> 01:41:03.859
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:41:03.861 --> 01:41:06.895
We all need to explain things,
so just stop waving that thing,

01:41:06.897 --> 01:41:08.196
okay?

01:41:08.198 --> 01:41:11.232
This is some real <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> shit.

01:41:11.234 --> 01:41:13.767
You are crazy.

01:41:13.769 --> 01:41:16.035
Get your ass upstairs!

01:41:16.037 --> 01:41:18.904
I can't believe this is
the little bitch he wanted.

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.038
Get up!

01:41:23.977 --> 01:41:25.109
Darnell!

01:41:33.117 --> 01:41:35.450
Darnell, I got your little
nappy head in here.

01:41:35.452 --> 01:41:37.385
You ain't shit without that gun.

01:41:37.387 --> 01:41:38.486
You better shut up.

01:41:39.755 --> 01:41:41.287
Darnell... Where are...?

01:41:41.289 --> 01:41:42.888
Come out or I'll kill her!

01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:45.624
Count of three.
One... two...

01:42:07.278 --> 01:42:08.543
<i>I guess in the end,</i>

01:42:08.545 --> 01:42:10.878
<i>a brother's got to pay.</i>

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.280
<i>He's got to pay
for every choice he makes.</i>

01:42:13.282 --> 01:42:14.381
<i>It's a thin line</i>

01:42:14.383 --> 01:42:16.082
<i>between love and hate.</i>

01:42:16.084 --> 01:42:18.217
<i>Nigger, you full of shit!</i>

01:42:18.219 --> 01:42:20.052
<i>All your damn promises.</i>

01:42:20.054 --> 01:42:21.186
<i>Just get out my face.</i>

01:42:21.188 --> 01:42:23.888
<i>You just better praise the Lord</i>

01:42:23.890 --> 01:42:28.191
<i>for giving your lucky ass
a second chance.</i>

01:42:29.761 --> 01:42:31.193
<i>There it is, y'all.</i>

01:42:31.195 --> 01:42:32.861
<i>I stopped trying to be the man,</i>

01:42:32.863 --> 01:42:35.029
<i>and became a man.</i>

01:42:35.031 --> 01:42:36.830
<i>I guess an ass-whipping'll
do that to you.</i>

01:42:36.832 --> 01:42:38.431
Just relax.

01:42:38.433 --> 01:42:41.167
<i>I got lucky when I finally
opened my eyes.</i>

01:42:41.169 --> 01:42:42.601
<i>Mia was still by my side.</i>

01:42:44.404 --> 01:42:47.204
<i>As for Brandi,</i>

01:42:47.206 --> 01:42:49.339
<i>well, she taught me
the true meaning of...</i>

01:42:49.341 --> 01:42:52.342
<i>Of the words, "I love you."</i>

01:42:54.012 --> 01:42:55.612
<i>Don't ever use them unless you mean it.</i>

01:42:59.949 --> 01:43:00.949
<i>Damn!</i>

01:43:03.084 --> 01:43:06.418
<i>I'm truly sorry about
what happened to Brandi.</i>

01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:09.053
<i>Hope baby lands on her feet.</i>

01:43:09.055 --> 01:43:11.155
<i>But they better make damn sure</i>

01:43:11.157 --> 01:43:12.923
<i>they fix the dent in her heart</i>

01:43:12.925 --> 01:43:14.758
<i>before they let her out.</i>
