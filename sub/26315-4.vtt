WEBVTT

00:01.914 --> 00:04.613
Previously on Mom... I'm Bonnie,
and I'm an alcoholic.

00:04.656 --> 00:07.355
ALL: Hi, Bon...Bonnie Plunkett?!

00:07.398 --> 00:10.314
You ruined my life![screams]

00:10.358 --> 00:12.012
You got me kicked
out of that house.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.361
No, no, you got
kicked out because

00:13.404 --> 00:14.884
you stole our foster
father's wallet.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.320
No, you stole his
wallet and planted it

00:16.364 --> 00:19.106
in my book bag.
Oh, yeah.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.195
I went to the prison
officials and explained

00:21.238 --> 00:23.632
your attack on me
was totally justified.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.547
Do you still draw?
What?

00:25.590 --> 00:28.332
You used to draw all those
crazy snakes everywhere.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.681
Remember I drew one
on the neck of that

00:29.725 --> 00:31.814
crazy redheaded guy
when he was asleep?

00:31.857 --> 00:34.208
What was his name?I don't remember.
Man, he was psycho.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.688
Good in bed, though.Yeah, he was.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.566
Sorry I'm late.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.829
I got everything on your list,
so if the guards tell you

00:46.872 --> 00:48.918
there were no Skittles,
then your conspiracy theory

00:48.961 --> 00:51.355
becomes cold, hard fact.

00:51.399 --> 00:52.704
Don't need 'em,
don't care.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.054
I'm getting out
of this place.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.925
You're escaping?
Are you using my plan?

00:55.968 --> 00:57.231
I swear, it'll work.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.710
No, I got parole.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.190
How? I mean, great!

01:00.234 --> 01:02.758
Yeah. Yeah, fourth
time's the charm.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.760
Turns out, you throw enough
Bible quotes at them,

01:04.803 --> 01:07.980
and who punched who during
what riot just fades away.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.287
Well, hallelujah.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.376
That's fantastic news.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.204
Yeah, and none of it would've
happened without you.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.902
Me?
Yeah. Before you
came back in my life,

01:16.946 --> 01:19.166
I had no idea people
like us could change,

01:19.209 --> 01:21.037
but then I look
at you and the life

01:21.081 --> 01:23.866
you've built for yourself,
and it gives me hope.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.650
You're my role model.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.957
Oh, damn it, why is
Marjorie never around

01:28.000 --> 01:30.046
when I'm being praised?

01:30.090 --> 01:33.484
So, uh, what's the deal?
When do you get out?

01:33.528 --> 01:35.138
Next Wednesday, 4:00 a.m.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.445
The big gate opens, I
get my pocketknife back,

01:37.488 --> 01:39.316
and the shuttle takes me
to the halfway house.

01:39.360 --> 01:43.277
4:00 a.m.?
Yeah, they save a
breakfast that way.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.930
Oh.

01:44.974 --> 01:48.847
Okay. Okay.

01:48.891 --> 01:51.372
Okay. Crazy idea:

01:51.415 --> 01:53.069
What if instead of
the halfway house,

01:53.113 --> 01:55.158
I pick you up
and you come live with me?

01:55.202 --> 01:56.812
Really?

01:56.855 --> 01:58.857
H-How can I be
a role model

01:58.901 --> 02:01.773
if you're not around
to see me work my magic?

02:01.817 --> 02:04.036
You better not be
messing with me,

02:04.080 --> 02:06.038
because I would
totally love that.

02:06.082 --> 02:08.171
This is a decision
that should probably

02:08.215 --> 02:10.956
take some thought,
but let's do it.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.045
Man, I would hug you
if there wasn't

02:13.089 --> 02:14.699
bulletproof glass
between us.

02:14.743 --> 02:18.094
Oh, come on, what the hell?Oh, no.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.228
I-If you knew what's been
rubbed on that glass,

02:21.271 --> 02:22.620
you might not
want to...
Oh, yeah.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.144
Yeah. Ugh. Yeah.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.581
It's, uh,
it's pretty moist.
Yeah.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.626
♪

02:48.472 --> 02:50.170
Listen, I have to
be the first share

02:50.213 --> 02:51.606
at the meeting tonight
and then I'm splitting.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.477
We're allowed to
leave if we get bored?

02:54.870 --> 02:57.002
You two mind if
I go before you?

02:58.700 --> 03:00.310
I'm not leaving
because I'm bored.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.573
If I catch the first half
of the AA meeting,

03:02.617 --> 03:04.880
I can catch the second half of
my Gamblers Anonymous meeting

03:04.923 --> 03:08.492
before I go home and read
300 sexy pages of property law.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.581
May I remind you
that any problem

03:10.625 --> 03:12.888
can be an opportunity
for growth.

03:12.931 --> 03:15.673
May I remind you,
most of your day is drinking tea

03:15.717 --> 03:17.240
while sitting still.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.201
I'm hungry.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.072
You're eating.

03:23.115 --> 03:26.554
I'm tired.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.904
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.514
[whoops] 200 miles
with the windows open,

03:30.558 --> 03:32.255
I still smell like jail.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.517
That what that is?

03:33.561 --> 03:34.910
I thought it was
Wendy's soup.

03:34.953 --> 03:37.391
Oh, I thought it was
your spray tan.

03:44.398 --> 03:45.790
MARJORIE:
So...

03:45.834 --> 03:47.705
How is Tammy doing?She's getting out.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.229
You're kidding;
that's great.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.752
Yeah, good for her.

03:50.795 --> 03:53.363
You know what's even
better for her? Me.

03:53.407 --> 03:55.147
Challenge.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.932
Accepted.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.716
Turns out she
looks up to me.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.675
She says she wouldn't
even be getting out

04:00.718 --> 04:03.199
if it weren't for the positive
impact I've had on her life.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.028
To be fair, she wouldn't have
been in there if it weren't

04:06.071 --> 04:08.160
for the "positive impact"
you had on her life.

04:09.205 --> 04:12.164
Oh, roasted and toasted.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.166
Do you want to hear
my story or not?

04:14.210 --> 04:16.386
Can you skip
the part about you?

04:16.430 --> 04:21.130
Ooh! Wendy with
the three-pointer.

04:21.173 --> 04:23.350
Instead of landing
in a halfway house,

04:23.393 --> 04:25.090
Tammy's gonna
live with me.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.701
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:26.744 --> 04:29.660
"Me," as in us?
'Cause "us" includes me.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.401
Yeah. I mean, what kind
of person would I be

04:31.445 --> 04:32.881
if I left her on her own?

04:32.924 --> 04:36.145
Well, the kind of person
you usually are.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.409
If you high-five
one more person,

04:39.453 --> 04:41.193
I'm gonna poke you
right in the boob.

04:41.237 --> 04:44.240
I'm actually fine with
you bringing her home.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.547
Really? Because I spent
the whole drive over here

04:46.590 --> 04:48.375
fighting with you in
my head about this.

04:48.418 --> 04:51.203
I will never get over
the things you said.

04:51.247 --> 04:54.294
Mom, I get it.
You're being of service.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.600
Which is what the program
tells us to do.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.950
But I want to be
perfectly clear.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.953
She's your responsibility.

05:01.997 --> 05:05.609
You feed her, you walk her,

05:05.653 --> 05:07.872
you clean up after her.

05:10.005 --> 05:13.138
Understood. You won't have
to do a thing; I got this.

05:13.182 --> 05:17.186
I'm sure you don't.
But let's crash forward anyway.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.146
Ooh, y'all gonna be
living with a felon.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.888
You better hide all
your expensive st--

05:26.195 --> 05:28.197
Never mind.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.855
Morning.
Hey.

05:33.898 --> 05:36.292
Man, your mom blew out of here
in the middle of the night.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.991
Yeah, I heard her trip over the
metal chair in the courtyard.

05:40.035 --> 05:43.125
Hard to believe
she was once a burglar.

05:43.168 --> 05:46.346
So, tell me about Tammy.
What am I in for?

05:46.389 --> 05:50.175
Huge, pushy, loose cannon--

05:50.219 --> 05:52.134
well-intentioned,
but a little scary.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.005
So, in other words, Bonnie.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.661
Yeah, but fresh out of the cage.

05:57.705 --> 06:00.882
Yikes. Permission to get high?

06:00.925 --> 06:02.405
Granted.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.320
[loud clatter outside]BONNIE:
Damn!

06:04.364 --> 06:05.713
Who the hell
left a chair tipped over

06:05.756 --> 06:07.018
in the middle of the courtyard?!

06:09.238 --> 06:11.675
Here we are.
Welcome to our humble abode.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.417
Dog!
Tammy!

06:14.461 --> 06:17.551
Come back; he's harmless.

06:17.594 --> 06:20.205
Sorry, uh, dogs and
me have never been

06:20.249 --> 06:22.077
on the same page.Uh...

06:22.120 --> 06:24.253
Don't worry; he loves everybody.

06:24.296 --> 06:27.212
Uh, lot of challenges today;
just power through.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.953
[clears throat]
Hi, I'm Tammy.

06:28.997 --> 06:31.565
Adam.
Oh, the touch
of a man.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.131
[gasps]
Sorry.

06:33.175 --> 06:35.569
Sorry, that one just
snuck up on me. [laughs]

06:35.612 --> 06:37.440
Hey, Christy.

06:37.484 --> 06:40.530
Hi, Tammy, welcome.Uh, so,
give me the tour.

06:40.574 --> 06:44.316
Well, this is the part
we're proud of.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.841
Oh. You should be.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.582
I mean, you got
furniture, a TV.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.367
I can stretch my arms out
and not touch the walls.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.978
Okay, bathroom's over
here, couch pulls out,

06:54.022 --> 06:55.719
and you're welcome to
anything in the fridge.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.461
The rice in the Tupperware
is for the dog, just know that.

06:58.505 --> 07:01.072
Super cool of you guys
to let me stay here.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.900
Bring it in,
Big Sauce.
Ah.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.902
[grunting]
Oh!

07:04.946 --> 07:07.862
Sh-She, she calls
me Big Sauce.

07:07.905 --> 07:10.081
Well, I'm off
to law school.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.648
Wait, you're in law school?

07:11.692 --> 07:15.565
That's right, Tammy.
I can be inspiring, too.

07:20.875 --> 07:25.009
Okay. So, you want to unpack
your, uh, suitcase?

07:25.053 --> 07:27.577
Nah, it's just
a toothbrush and a catsuit

07:27.621 --> 07:28.926
that doesn't fit me anymore.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.103
Hey, were you serious
about the fridge?

07:32.147 --> 07:34.279
Anything you want.Awesome. Thank you.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.107
Friend.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.632
Friend. F-Friend.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.940
So?

07:42.984 --> 07:46.291
I like her.
She's got a lot of energy.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.946
Well, she's a little overexcited
right now; she'll calm down.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.122
TAMMY: Whoa, what the hell's
coconut water?!

07:53.516 --> 07:55.605
Wait till she spots
the almond milk.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.041
TAMMY:
Oh, my God!

08:00.349 --> 08:02.699
I just can't believe a dead pet
comes back in my dream

08:02.743 --> 08:05.615
and has nothing to say to me.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.662
I also had a sex dream about
the parking guy at Neiman's.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.795
I forgot to get
my ticket validated

08:11.839 --> 08:13.580
and it just went on from there.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.409
Anyway.

08:17.453 --> 08:20.848
Desperate for sex, miss my dog,
grateful to be sober, thanks.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.853
Okay, who else
would like to share?

08:25.896 --> 08:27.855
Get in there, kid.Oh, okay, sure.

08:27.898 --> 08:29.247
Hey, uh, Tammy,
alcoholic.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.032
GROUP:
Hi, Tammy.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.642
Wow, I just-- I can't believe

08:32.686 --> 08:34.209
I'm sitting here
out in the world,

08:34.252 --> 08:36.167
living in a really nice
place thanks to this

08:36.211 --> 08:38.561
Wonder Woman right here.
Is it okay that I say that?

08:38.605 --> 08:39.823
It's your share.
Okay.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.390
Uh, anyway.

08:41.433 --> 08:44.001
I got sober in prison,
so, uh, doing the program

08:44.045 --> 08:46.569
on the outside's
a little scary.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.745
There's so many new
ways to get wasted now.

08:48.789 --> 08:52.662
I mean, cotton candy-flavored
vodka?

08:52.706 --> 08:55.186
Where were you
when I was sad, right?

08:55.230 --> 08:59.060
Anyway, I got to get phone,
I got to get a job--

08:59.103 --> 09:00.801
Hell, I got to get pants.

09:00.844 --> 09:05.762
But, again, you know,
thank God I have a friend here

09:05.806 --> 09:08.417
who's got my back.
P.S. I have hers, too.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.681
So that's your warning.
I'm serious.

09:11.725 --> 09:15.511
I'm giving each
and every one of you the eye.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.295
You...
Tammy.

09:17.339 --> 09:20.647
It-It's okay.
Oh, sorry.
Prison. [laughs]

09:21.865 --> 09:23.954
[sighs]

09:23.998 --> 09:26.522
I'm just really grateful
to be sober.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.004
And I'd love to tongue kiss
whoever made these cookies.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.841
No.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.280
You don't even know
what I was gonna ask.

09:45.323 --> 09:46.760
I'm pretty sure I do.

09:46.803 --> 09:51.634
I didn't get to bed
till 3:00 a.m., so, no.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.288
3:00 a.m.?
[groans]

09:53.331 --> 09:54.768
Tammy's a talker.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.639
And a crier.

09:56.683 --> 09:57.858
And a laugher.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.208
And then a talker again.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.644
Sorry you had
a rough night.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.777
[sighs]:
No, no.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.083
It's good.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.172
[yawning]: 'Cause when
you're doing good things

10:08.216 --> 10:12.742
in the world, it's-- mm-- good.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.918
Mm. Hmm.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.920
Great, you're up.
Oh, hey, Adam.
[screams]

10:16.964 --> 10:18.922
How are you today?
Uh...

10:18.966 --> 10:21.664
Pillow makes his hair
kind of fluffy.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.797
Hey, I wanted to
make you breakfast,

10:23.840 --> 10:26.626
but I wasn't sure if you
like eggs, you like bacon...

10:26.669 --> 10:28.192
Damn it! Everyone likes bacon.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.890
Think it through, Tammy!It's okay.

10:29.933 --> 10:33.894
I'm just gonna pop into
the bathroom for a second.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.852
Roger that, boss.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.332
So what's on the agenda
for today?

10:37.375 --> 10:39.334
'Cause anything is okay with me.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.815
I mean, there's so many places
I haven't been in seven years.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.121
The beach, the park, Denny's.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.471
You can't beat a menu
with pictures.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.909
Hey, I know I got to get started
looking for a job,

10:48.952 --> 10:50.606
but then I thought,
"Oh, come on, Tammy.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.825
Give yourself half a day."

10:51.868 --> 10:53.827
[toilet flushes]

10:53.870 --> 10:56.656
I'm a much better planner
after coffee.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.353
Oh, shoot! I was
gonna make you coffee,

10:58.396 --> 10:59.963
but you got that flimsy
top loader there,

11:00.007 --> 11:02.966
and I'm used to making
coffee for 200 women.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.272
Hey, I found this in your couch.

11:04.315 --> 11:06.013
Hope it's okay I'm using it.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.931
Water goes in there. Got it.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.628
Morning.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.847
Hey, Spoonful.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.112
Your mom's showing me
how to make coffee.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.114
Yeah, making coffee's
the one thing she can do

11:20.157 --> 11:21.681
before she has coffee.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.639
Hey, maybe Spoonful
can walk you through this

11:23.683 --> 11:25.162
while I go grab a shower.

11:25.206 --> 11:28.339
Love to,
but got to get to school.

11:28.383 --> 11:31.516
Plus,
the way you make coffee is so...

11:31.560 --> 11:34.345
inspirational
and super role modely.

11:34.389 --> 11:37.000
Smug is not a good color on you.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.959
Yes, it is.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.787
Have a great day, Christy!

11:40.830 --> 11:42.136
[whirring]Whoa!
[barking]

11:42.179 --> 11:44.399
[shrieks]
Take her.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.579
Hello. Can I help you?

11:50.622 --> 11:53.234
I'm looking
for Tammy Diffendorf.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.670
You a friend of hers?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.324
I'm her parole officer,

11:56.367 --> 11:58.065
here for an inspection.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.023
I don't think
she knows you're coming.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.460
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.158
Uh, right.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.855
That door there.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.901
Oh. Thank you.Mm-hmm.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.252
[knocking]

12:15.822 --> 12:17.780
[glass breaking]

12:18.955 --> 12:21.784
[door slams shut]Hey!

12:33.100 --> 12:35.450
Where's your shadow?[scoffs]

12:35.493 --> 12:37.713
Two stories
and a glass of water,

12:37.757 --> 12:39.628
but I finally got her down.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.282
What did you guys do today?

12:41.325 --> 12:44.764
You know that geyser
in Calistoga we've never seen?

12:44.807 --> 12:47.201
Well, I've seen it,
and you don't need to.

12:47.244 --> 12:50.117
Is Big Sauce having
second thoughts?

12:50.160 --> 12:52.336
Not at all.

12:52.380 --> 12:55.818
Tammy is a delight, and I
will see you in the morning.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.038
Hold up.
Where do you think you're going?

12:58.081 --> 13:01.171
Adam's.
Oh, no, no.
No, no, you are not.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.957
What's the big deal?
I want to be with my fiancé.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.263
Why can't he sleep here?He can.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.961
He just finds it difficult

13:08.004 --> 13:10.180
living under Tammy's
parole restrictions, and...

13:10.224 --> 13:11.834
He can't get high.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.706
I don't care! You are not
leaving me alone with her!

13:14.750 --> 13:16.839
You promised that she would be
your responsibility.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.189
But I miss Adam.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.017
Well, you should have thought
of that before...

13:21.061 --> 13:23.890
[Tammy screaming]

13:27.415 --> 13:29.025
No!
Tammy!

13:29.069 --> 13:30.548
Tammy, wake up!

13:30.592 --> 13:31.985
[groaning]

13:32.028 --> 13:33.987
Tammy, it's me,
Big Sauce!

13:34.030 --> 13:36.119
Oh!
Whoa!

13:36.163 --> 13:38.339
So close.
TAMMY:
What?

13:38.382 --> 13:39.862
What happened?

13:39.906 --> 13:41.864
You were having a bad dream.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.735
[sighs]
No.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.563
That was a night terror.

13:45.607 --> 13:48.175
I'm sorry. Did I forget
to mention I get night terrors?

13:49.741 --> 13:51.221
It's okay, Tammy.

13:51.265 --> 13:52.701
My mom is here for you.

13:52.744 --> 13:54.790
Good night.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.447
Will you read me
Goodnight Moonagain?

14:02.798 --> 14:04.887
I would have been okay
at a Goodwill.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.410
We didn't have to go fancy.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.456
When you can buy tires

14:08.499 --> 14:11.807
at the same place you're buying
clothes, it's not that fancy.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.244
You just need some basics.Mm.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.420
Well, as long as they got
a little zing to 'em.

14:16.464 --> 14:19.902
I want to start dating ASAP.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.862
How about we focus on an
outfit for a job interview?

14:22.905 --> 14:24.341
See, that's why I need you.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.953
Here I am, craving
a hairy back I can scratch up,

14:26.996 --> 14:29.520
and you got your eye
on the big picture.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.611
Okay, let's start you
off with some jeans.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.918
Everyone needs a solid pair
of those. What's your style?

14:35.962 --> 14:38.138
Oh, I don't really know.Okay, well, you got

14:38.181 --> 14:40.792
the boot cut, the boyfriend cut,
the low-rise, the high-rise.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.098
Personally, I like
a nice jegging.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.534
What the hell's a "jegging"?

14:43.578 --> 14:45.014
They're leggings
that look like jeans.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.103
Well, what are you saying?
Can't I just have blue?

14:47.147 --> 14:48.626
Well, sure. You want the
stonewashed, prewashed, vintage?

14:48.670 --> 14:50.324
Oh, my God, stop.What's wrong?

14:50.367 --> 14:51.934
You're just... you're coming
at me with a lot of stuff.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.457
I mean,
for the last seven years,

14:53.501 --> 14:54.981
I've worn nothing
but prison sweats.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.808
Well, great. Let's go
check out some sweats.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.549
Why would I want sweats?!
That's all I've been wearing

14:58.593 --> 15:00.073
for seven years.
Haven't you been listening?!

15:00.116 --> 15:01.988
Tammy, it's okay.
Take a breath.

15:02.031 --> 15:04.904
[wheezing]
I'm trying. Can't.
Can't breathe.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.036
Too many damn choices!

15:07.080 --> 15:08.516
Are you ladies
finding everything okay?

15:08.559 --> 15:09.909
We're fine.I'm not.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.693
Well, if you don't see
anything you like,

15:11.736 --> 15:13.260
we've got more choices
in the back.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.349
No more choices!
I make bad choices.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.438
That's how I ended up in prison!

15:19.657 --> 15:21.659
Why is everyone staring at me?

15:21.703 --> 15:23.574
Stop looking at me.
Don't look at me!

15:23.618 --> 15:25.098
Oh, my God,
this is so soft.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.143
Do you have it in my size?

15:29.319 --> 15:31.017
They're called
night terrors.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.670
She has them
all the time.

15:32.714 --> 15:35.238
Last night, she actually got
a lock of my mom's hair.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.589
Poor Bonnie.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.287
Are you kidding me?

15:40.330 --> 15:43.812
This is the greatest payback
in the history of the universe.

15:43.855 --> 15:46.380
I finally believe in God.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.859
Ooh, buckle up.

15:47.903 --> 15:49.818
Here comes 12
feet of scary.

15:49.861 --> 15:53.300
Ah. Look at you, Tammy.Ooh.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.692
Yeah, you look very nice.

15:54.736 --> 15:55.955
Thanks. I picked
'em out myself.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.391
So shopping was a success.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.001
We got out alive.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.221
What happened?Oh, I totally freaked out

16:01.264 --> 16:04.528
and punched a mannequin,
but after some deep breaths

16:04.572 --> 16:08.706
and a trip to Color Me Mine with
Big Sauce here, I calmed down.

16:08.750 --> 16:12.058
Your mugs are
all on the way.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.670
Well, you just
got out of prison.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.193
It's a big adjustment.

16:17.237 --> 16:20.022
I remember when I first got out,
took me a few months

16:20.066 --> 16:22.503
to take a shower
without bringing a knife.

16:22.546 --> 16:23.939
See? Knife in
the shower.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.246
It's a muscle memory.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.552
We had a little Bates Motel
incident this morning.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.381
Hey, put me down
for a Denver omelet.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.035
I got to hit the can.Tammy?

16:33.079 --> 16:34.732
The knife.Right, right, right.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.212
We were just talking about it.

16:36.256 --> 16:39.041
Be better, Tammy.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.565
I am so proud of you.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.045
You're doing a
wonderful thing.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.612
Yeah, I'm seeing you
in a whole new light.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.744
I got to get rid of her.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.790
Yeah, I told you she wouldn't
last more than two days.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.401
Y'all owe me five bucks.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.621
I can't do this.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.753
I feel like one of those people
who brings in a dog

16:55.797 --> 16:57.538
and realizes it's a coyote.

16:57.581 --> 17:01.237
Bonnie, a person just out of
prison is gonna be a challenge.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.065
Yeah, I know that now, Marge.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.806
The worst part is,
this was my idea.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.938
She was all set
to go to a halfway house

17:06.982 --> 17:09.202
where they probably have some
vague notion what they're doing,

17:09.245 --> 17:11.856
but I had to open my big,
generous mouth. Uh.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.338
Why couldn't you
just tell me "no"?

17:15.382 --> 17:17.036
You're usually so good at that.

17:17.079 --> 17:21.083
I was trying to be supportive.
It'll never happen again.

17:21.127 --> 17:24.130
So, who's gonna tell her
she's got to go? Christy?

17:25.522 --> 17:28.090
Marjorie? Christy?

17:28.134 --> 17:31.876
Oh, no, if she's gonna be
driven out to the country

17:31.920 --> 17:34.053
and left in a field,
you're doing it.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.924
Fine.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.448
I just have to wait for the
right moment when she's happy

17:38.492 --> 17:39.841
and there's plenty of people
around.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.583
But not us, right?

17:42.626 --> 17:45.064
How sweet is a dumper
with a door?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.416
[whispers]

17:51.853 --> 17:53.420
There you are!

17:53.463 --> 17:56.336
I wasn't hiding.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.599
Man, I just cannot get used

17:58.642 --> 18:01.123
to this having no structure,
you know?

18:01.167 --> 18:03.604
Nobody telling me where to be,
what to do,

18:03.647 --> 18:05.997
when to go outside for an hour.

18:06.041 --> 18:09.653
Yeah, that's a
tricky one. [sniffles]

18:09.697 --> 18:12.656
You think it might help
if maybe-- I don't know--

18:12.700 --> 18:14.441
you were in
a more structured environment?

18:14.484 --> 18:16.138
Maybe around people
who were going through

18:16.182 --> 18:17.661
what you're going through?

18:17.705 --> 18:20.099
No, I got you.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.840
Sure, sure.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.451
So, what's the problem there?

18:24.494 --> 18:25.843
Oh. Not a clue.
I know it's leaking.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.236
I'm just taking it apart looking

18:27.280 --> 18:28.498
for something
with a crack in it.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.501
Hand me that wrench.Why?

18:31.545 --> 18:34.809
I want to take a shot at it.Oh. Sure, yeah.
Knock yourself out.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.158
All right. [groans]

18:36.202 --> 18:38.334
[sighs]
You know, Tammy,

18:38.378 --> 18:41.163
people are a lot
like washing machines.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.034
When they're broken,
they need to go

18:43.078 --> 18:45.515
to a special place
for broken machines.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.997
I guess what I'm trying
to say is I just don't think...

18:49.040 --> 18:50.694
There you go.

18:50.738 --> 18:53.262
What?The fill hose was loose.
I tightened her back up.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.438
Wait. It's fixed?As good as new.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.527
I mean, for a piece of
junk that's 20 years old.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.529
How did you know
how to do that?

18:59.573 --> 19:02.141
Oh, God, are you kidding me?
I was locked up for seven years.

19:02.184 --> 19:06.275
I took building maintenance,
electrical, plumbing, carpentry.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.886
Every time I signed up for
cosmetology, it was full,

19:08.930 --> 19:12.063
so I can't cut your hair.

19:12.107 --> 19:14.936
But I can sheetrock
like a son of a bitch.

19:14.979 --> 19:19.070
Huh.Hot damn, it feels good to
finally do something for you.

19:19.114 --> 19:21.334
Huh.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.817
♪ Do, do-do-do, do, do

19:26.861 --> 19:29.080
♪ Dah, dee, dee,
bee, badoop-boo. ♪

19:29.124 --> 19:30.865
Hey.
Hey.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.302
I'm almost
afraid to ask.

19:33.346 --> 19:35.478
Did you talk to Tammy?

19:35.522 --> 19:37.611
Oh, I started to, but you know,

19:37.654 --> 19:39.482
it's really only been
a couple of days.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.832
I mean, is it tough? Yes.

19:41.876 --> 19:45.271
Maybe the hardest thing I've
ever done in my entire life.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.273
But is it worth it?

19:47.316 --> 19:49.971
I think we both know
the answer to that.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.235
Hey, I rekeyed
the lock on 2A,

19:53.279 --> 19:55.106
and fixed the blind
guy's air conditioner.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.934
Now I got to started
on the floodlights.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.023
But I might need a ride
to the hardware store

19:59.067 --> 20:00.938
to pick up some
Romex and conduit.
Okay.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.984
I don't know what
any of that is, but you got it.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.465
Great. I'm just gonna
grab a coconut water.

20:07.815 --> 20:10.296
Leave me alone.
It's a win-win.

20:17.738 --> 20:21.350
[Tammy yelling]

20:21.394 --> 20:26.399
That's your cue, Big Sauce.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.923
Oh. [groaning]

20:34.929 --> 20:37.975
[water shooting,
Tammy yelling]

20:38.019 --> 20:40.978
BONNIE:
Christy, help!
I got too close!

20:41.022 --> 20:42.545
Ow!
Be right there.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.982
[muffled yelling and groaning]

20:47.942 --> 20:49.726
Christy, help!
