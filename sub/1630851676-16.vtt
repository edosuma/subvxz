00:02.306 --> 00:05.005
What does your mom do again?I don't know, charity stuff.

00:05.048 --> 00:07.050
I'm the one you call
when you can't call 911.

00:07.094 --> 00:09.052
Previously onThe Equalizer...

00:09.096 --> 00:11.141
You don't work
for a charity, do you, Mom?

00:11.185 --> 00:12.621
No matter what I do,
I'm always your mom.

00:12.664 --> 00:13.578
I know that you lied to me.

00:14.492 --> 00:15.885
I am a NYPD...Stop!

00:15.928 --> 00:17.756
This guy's a cop.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.062
We'll take him out
to Youngstrom's farm.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.411
No one will ever know.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.112
Give that to the chief for me.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.157
I'm afraid of who
I might become.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.471
Okay, what about Leroy,
if it's a boy?

00:36.514 --> 00:38.429
Leroy? Oh, you can't be serious.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.388
What? It's distinguished.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.867
My uncle's name is Leroy.

00:41.911 --> 00:44.696
Your uncle is also 82 years old.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.481
I will not do that
to our child.

00:47.786 --> 00:50.006
Our child.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.185
The food.No, no, no. I'll go.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.405
You and little Leroy stay.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.624
Uh-uh. I'm telling you,
Leroy is gonna come out

00:59.668 --> 01:01.148
with an AARP card.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.280
Tim Colvin?

01:03.324 --> 01:04.890
Yeah.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.675
You're under arrest
for rape and murder

01:06.718 --> 01:08.329
in the first degree.Wait, wait, I'm under arrest
for what?

01:08.372 --> 01:09.939
You have the right to remain
silent, anything you say

01:09.982 --> 01:11.158
can and will be held
against youThis isn't right.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.289
in a court of law.You got the wrong guy.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.117
Stop! He-he didn't do anything!

01:14.161 --> 01:15.292
We'll figure this out.
I love you.Tim?

01:15.336 --> 01:17.468
I love you!Tim!

01:22.473 --> 01:25.520
If, after considering
the testimony and evidence,

01:25.563 --> 01:28.088
you find that the defendant
did commit the offenses

01:28.131 --> 01:30.220
of rape and murder
in the first degree,

01:30.264 --> 01:33.136
then you are authorized
to find the defendant guilty.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.051
If you have
any reasonable doubt,

01:35.095 --> 01:36.661
then you must
acquit the defendant.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.315
The verdict must be unanimous.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.622
And despite the seriousness
of the alleged offenses,

01:40.665 --> 01:42.319
you are to consider the facts

01:42.363 --> 01:45.496
without sympathy
or concern for punishment.

01:49.065 --> 01:52.286
Well, that's nine days
we will never get back again.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.026
Could've been one
if they didn't insist

01:54.070 --> 01:55.506
on "talking lawyer."

01:55.550 --> 01:57.291
I don't know, I mean,

01:57.334 --> 01:58.640
you hear about guys like this
all the time,

01:58.683 --> 02:00.120
but to actually be
a part of it--

02:00.163 --> 02:01.121
pretty cool.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.948
JI-
Let me guess.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.254
You're obsessed with true crime.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.517
Excuse me?
What do you care?

02:06.561 --> 02:07.779
How long do you think
we all have to be in here?

02:07.823 --> 02:09.172
I have work.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.434
Oh, we all got our lives
to get back to.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.349
Well, you're the foreman.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.134
What do you think about
taking a vote now?

02:14.177 --> 02:15.135
Sure.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.006
Let's take a vote.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.355
Let's do hands in the air.

02:18.399 --> 02:19.661
All for guilty?

02:24.883 --> 02:26.494
Wait. Really?

02:26.537 --> 02:28.539
I was gonna say the same thing.

02:28.583 --> 02:31.063
You really think the defense
proved this guy is innocent?

02:31.107 --> 02:32.587
She doesn't have to.

02:32.630 --> 02:35.546
The prosecution has to prove
that he's guilty

02:35.590 --> 02:37.766
beyond a reasonable doubt,

02:37.809 --> 02:38.897
and I have one.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.203
He's clearly guilty.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.031
He admitted to being
at the scene.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.772
He was spotted running away

02:43.815 --> 02:45.817
right after the victim's
time of death.

02:45.861 --> 02:48.168
He admitted to being in
the building, not at the scene,

02:48.211 --> 02:50.605
and haven't you ever run
for a cab?

02:50.648 --> 02:52.607
What about his violent history?

02:52.650 --> 02:53.999
The argument with his fiancÃ©e?

02:54.043 --> 02:55.392
The cut on his arm?

02:55.436 --> 02:57.916
Right, from struggling
with the victim.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.222
Weren't you listening
to the evidence?

02:59.266 --> 03:00.528
I was.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.617
He said he got the cut

03:02.660 --> 03:06.011
from tripping on the street,
and...

03:06.055 --> 03:08.318
it was on his hand, not his arm.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.625
Does it matter
where the cut was?Maybe.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.235
Look, I'm not sure

03:12.279 --> 03:13.802
of his innocence,
but what I do know is that

03:13.845 --> 03:16.979
if we vote to convict,

03:17.022 --> 03:19.024
a human being goes to prison

03:19.068 --> 03:21.418
for the rest of his life.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.681
So he deserves to have us
take a hard look

03:23.725 --> 03:26.206
at the facts.

03:26.249 --> 03:29.209
The least we could do is start
by getting them straight.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.475
Mom. Hey, where's my red hoodie?

03:34.518 --> 03:36.433
I want to wear it to Dad's
this weekend.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.870
It is in the laundry room.

03:38.914 --> 03:42.222
And you know that machine is
not password protected, right?

03:42.265 --> 03:43.832
When's Aunt Vi done
with jury duty again?

03:45.094 --> 03:47.444
What does that have to do
with you helping out around here

03:47.488 --> 03:48.576
before you go to your dad's?

03:49.838 --> 03:51.535
By the way...

03:51.579 --> 03:53.624
how are you feeling about
seeing your dad?

03:53.668 --> 03:55.365
What do you mean?

03:56.845 --> 03:59.064
These questions
he's been asking you about me,

03:59.108 --> 04:00.675
about what I'm involved in.

04:00.718 --> 04:03.286
I mean, I'm-I'm fine.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.722
Well, if I have to lie
to keep your secret...

04:07.029 --> 04:08.422
I know how to handle Dad.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.121
Well...

04:13.427 --> 04:15.646
Don't start trying that
around here.

04:15.690 --> 04:16.995
What?

04:17.039 --> 04:18.432
What? No way.

04:18.475 --> 04:19.824
Would never.

04:19.868 --> 04:21.435
Yeah, never. That's right.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.480
Hey, Aunt Vi.

04:23.524 --> 04:25.003
You look exhausted.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.266
Locked in a room

04:26.309 --> 04:28.311
for hours with 11 strangers.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.878
Can't imagine why.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.314
Five minutes in, they're ready

04:31.358 --> 04:32.576
to send this young man
away for life,

04:32.620 --> 04:34.274
with no discussion.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.276
Hell no.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.103
I will get
these people talking.

04:38.147 --> 04:40.410
I will keep them there till
winter if that's what it takes.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.847
Well, guess I got
some laundry to do.

04:42.891 --> 04:43.805
Thank you.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.852
The arrogance of these people.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.245
I mean,

04:49.289 --> 04:50.507
I don't know
if he did it or not,

04:50.551 --> 04:52.335
but they don't either.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.511
And that's why
we're supposed to deliberate,

04:54.555 --> 04:56.818
not just declare a hung jury

04:56.861 --> 04:59.255
because they've already
made up their minds.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.649
No one likes to admit
they could be wrong.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.955
Means they have to
reexamine everything.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.393
Yes, and that's why
we're there.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.438
But I'm telling you

05:08.482 --> 05:10.353
there is something about
this evidence

05:10.397 --> 05:13.051
that just doesn't sit right
with me.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.488
It's too...

05:14.531 --> 05:18.187
It's too tidy.
It's too black and white.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.320
Well, what's the case?

05:20.363 --> 05:22.931
You know I can't tell you that.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.499
Doesn't matter.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.544
It's too late now, anyway.

05:28.937 --> 05:32.114
I just think there's
a messy truth out there that...

05:34.029 --> 05:36.640
I just wish someone had taken
the time to find it.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.517
So, she refused to give you
any details about the trial,

05:43.560 --> 05:45.214
and you took that as
a personal invitation

05:45.257 --> 05:46.389
to dig into the case?

05:46.433 --> 05:48.391
Well, Aunt Vi is
too smart to ask.

05:48.435 --> 05:49.653
But she has
really good instincts,

05:49.697 --> 05:51.568
and a man's life is at stake,

05:51.612 --> 05:54.223
so let's just make sure
the jury has all the evidence.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.355
You know which courthouse?

05:55.398 --> 05:57.095
Nah. It's somewhere
in Brooklyn.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.097
Brooklyn, male defendant,
life sentence.

05:59.141 --> 06:00.272
Hold, please.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.580
What's up?

06:03.624 --> 06:06.670
You have that
"I'm here in body only" look.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.411
Dee is lying again.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.805
Isn't that what teenagers do?

06:10.848 --> 06:12.894
Yeah, but she's lying
to protect me.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.939
To her dad.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.071
He's been asking questions.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.768
Yeah, that is tricky.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.640
Yeah.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.946
I always taught her
that lying was wrong,

06:21.990 --> 06:24.122
but now she's learning
it's okay,

06:24.166 --> 06:25.341
that it can be necessary.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.821
Well, she's not wrong.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.431
I lie about Harry being dead
for years.

06:28.475 --> 06:29.911
Yeah, but you're an adult.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.913
Delilah is a high school kid,

06:31.956 --> 06:33.305
and it's her father.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.787
Lying can be a dangerous road,

06:36.831 --> 06:38.485
and I'm the one
that's put her on it.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.617
All right, I got it.

06:40.661 --> 06:43.490
Defendant's name is
Tim Colvin.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.970
He's charged with the
rape and murder of

06:46.014 --> 06:48.320
Sarah Ross, a white
college undergrad.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.366
So, eight months ago,

06:50.410 --> 06:52.020
Sarah, the victim,
is drinking at the bar

06:52.063 --> 06:53.587
with her roommate, Olivia,

06:53.630 --> 06:55.458
who sees Sarah
talking to this guy, Tim.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.068
Olivia goes home later,
finds Sarah

06:57.112 --> 06:59.201
strangled and raped
in her apartment,

06:59.244 --> 07:01.203
and Tim is seen running away
from the building.

07:01.246 --> 07:02.509
And what's Tim's story?

07:02.552 --> 07:04.206
I mean, guy says he's innocent.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.642
Says the only reason
he was even in the building was,

07:05.686 --> 07:07.862
he was going on a walk,
he got cold.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.733
Spotted the vestibule
through the window upstairs.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.431
Building looked cozy.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.041
Went in there, warmed up.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.434
Gets a cab and goes home.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.392
And talking to Sarah at the bar?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.654
I mean, he denies even being
at the bar,

07:17.698 --> 07:18.829
but he's got no alibi.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.396
The evidence is pretty damning.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.963
Who is this guy?

07:22.006 --> 07:23.443
I mean, he's an associate

07:23.486 --> 07:25.096
at an investment firm.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.576
He's got no record.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.186
He just bought a condo
with his fiancÃ©e.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.623
They look like a nice couple.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.102
Aunt Vi sat through
this whole trial

07:31.146 --> 07:32.843
and felt that
it was full of holes.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.584
I want to talk to Tim's fiancÃ©e,
Morgan.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.153
She knew him best.
Let's see what she thinks.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.418
Morgan Carver?Yeah.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.507
I'm with Champions
for the Wrongfully Convicted.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.031
We think
your fiancÃ©'s case may

07:47.075 --> 07:48.990
deserve a second look.

07:51.079 --> 07:53.124
Are you moving?

07:53.168 --> 07:54.474
Not by choice.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.303
Uh, with the attorney bills
and the baby...

07:58.347 --> 08:00.305
Morgan,

08:00.349 --> 08:02.090
between you and I,

08:02.133 --> 08:04.353
what do you think happened
eight months ago?

08:04.396 --> 08:07.574
Tim had just learned
that he was being let go.

08:07.617 --> 08:10.272
And that night,
I found out that

08:10.315 --> 08:13.449
he'd been offered a new job
by an ex-girlfriend,

08:13.493 --> 08:14.842
and he hadn't told me.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.104
We argued.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.715
He left...

08:18.759 --> 08:21.065
but the prosecution took it
all out of context

08:21.109 --> 08:24.068
and made it seem like
he was so angry from being fired

08:24.112 --> 08:25.679
that he went out
and killed a girl.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.681
Even dragged his upbringing
into it,

08:27.724 --> 08:29.204
as if growing up
in a rough neighborhood

08:29.247 --> 08:30.553
makes you a monster.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.077
Well, didn't the defense
track his phone?

08:33.121 --> 08:35.689
He left his phone
at the house that night.

08:35.732 --> 08:38.561
He went out for a walk
to cool down.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.345
So no one can account
for where he went.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.260
He was upset.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.567
We've all been there.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.264
Morgan, I have to ask you this,

08:46.308 --> 08:48.702
do you believe your fiancÃ©

08:48.745 --> 08:51.052
could have done
something like this?

08:52.053 --> 08:53.620
He didn't do it.

08:53.663 --> 08:56.492
I know that man

08:56.536 --> 08:57.754
without a shadow of a doubt,

08:57.798 --> 08:59.713
and he would not do
something like this.

09:02.672 --> 09:05.545
When I look at my son...

09:05.588 --> 09:07.590
I see Tim.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.940
What destroys me is that

09:09.984 --> 09:13.553
they may never see each other
outside of prison.

09:14.684 --> 09:15.772
If there's...

09:15.816 --> 09:18.296
any help that you can offer us,

09:18.340 --> 09:20.429
I'm begging you for it.

09:36.619 --> 09:37.620
Thinking about a career change?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.450
Might've missed my NBA window.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.365
I was actually
talking about that walk

09:43.408 --> 09:45.410
down memory lane.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.890
Thinking you want to go
back to law school?

09:48.196 --> 09:50.415
Lot of people make decisions
because they're running toward

09:50.459 --> 09:52.461
or away from their parents.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.594
I think I was doing both,
becoming a cop.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.205
I don't know if
I ever really knew

09:57.248 --> 09:58.728
what I wanted.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.819
Maybe I never really knew myself
at all.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.780
I think, in the end...

10:06.823 --> 10:10.044
we are what we can't let go of
and what can't let go of us.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.398
I left the force for a reason.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.575
I need some time to
work through things.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.316
And I respect that.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.361
All I need is a consult.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.146
Just give me five minutes,

10:25.189 --> 10:27.191
and if you don't want to be
involved, I will leave you be.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.458
So, what do you think?

10:33.502 --> 10:35.809
Solid case.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.289
Some of the evidence is
circumstantial, sure--

10:38.333 --> 10:40.988
the sedative in her system,
and Tim having a prescription.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.642
But without DNA
or fingerprints,

10:42.685 --> 10:44.556
lots of cases are built
this way.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.384
You know the detectives?

10:46.428 --> 10:48.691
They're good guys.
Casework's by the book.

10:48.735 --> 10:52.042
Maybe, but Tim was arrested
two days after the killing.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.870
No other suspects
were interviewed.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.655
Isn't it possible
they missed something?

10:55.698 --> 10:57.047
Sure.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.789
But sometimes
a cigar is just a cigar.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.792
I mean, I'd like to talk to Tim,

11:02.836 --> 11:05.099
but he's at trial
and in custody.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.667
His lawyer is the only one
allowed in to see him.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.843
Without my badge
I can't help with that.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.802
I'm also out of favors.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.718
And I meant what I said
about taking time.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.764
These questions
you want answered,

11:17.807 --> 11:19.853
you don't need me to ask them.

11:21.463 --> 11:22.507
What's there to question?

11:22.551 --> 11:24.814
The prosecution's case is solid.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.729
It's Tim's story
that is shaky as hell.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.513
I found it to be believable.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.211
Which part was
the most believable?

11:30.254 --> 11:31.647
Him taking a walk

11:31.691 --> 11:33.344
and conveniently forgetting
where he went?

11:33.388 --> 11:35.085
Or the bad luck

11:35.129 --> 11:36.739
where he was in the building

11:36.783 --> 11:37.914
while a girl was being
raped and murdered?

11:37.958 --> 11:39.437
JI-Dude,

11:39.481 --> 11:40.874
sarcasm is not gonna help here.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.397
Let's stick to the evidence.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.877
Which is that

11:43.920 --> 11:45.879
nobody can vouch
for Tim's story.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.664
On the other hand,
Sarah's roommate saw Tim

11:48.708 --> 11:51.101
giving her a glass of water
at the bar at00 p.m.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.495
Later, Sarah's neighbor
heard a scream,

11:53.538 --> 11:56.106
just as her favorite show was
starting at30,

11:56.150 --> 11:59.544
and Tim admits to running
for the cab a-at midnight.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.546
What about the DNA?

12:01.590 --> 12:03.331
Is anyone else disturbed
by the fact

12:03.374 --> 12:04.854
that there's no DNA evidence?

12:04.898 --> 12:07.030
Oh, he made sure of that.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.511
Tim had a half hour
to kill Sarah

12:09.554 --> 12:10.686
and clean up well enough
that there was

12:10.730 --> 12:12.427
no evidence left behind.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.342
The timeline makes sense.

12:14.385 --> 12:17.345
We can go around
and around all day.

12:17.388 --> 12:20.130
I have no doubt in my mind
that this man killed Sarah Ross.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.566
Why?

12:21.610 --> 12:23.133
This man with no record,

12:23.177 --> 12:25.614
with everything going for him,
what is his motive?

12:25.657 --> 12:28.573
I don't know if getting fired is
having everything going for you.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.140
The guy was pissed.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.838
He's riled up after the fight.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.491
He sees a white woman

12:33.535 --> 12:35.624
who looks just like the boss
who fired him,

12:35.667 --> 12:36.886
and he takes his rage out
on her.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.975
You can take 'em out
of the hood...

12:39.019 --> 12:41.412
Well. That seems a little...What?

12:41.456 --> 12:43.153
I don't know, problematic.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.503
And what would you know
about it, Connecticut?

12:45.547 --> 12:47.854
Now, he went from having nothing

12:47.897 --> 12:49.420
to everything.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.813
No wonder he feels so entitled.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.597
And he's the reason
men are being forced

12:52.641 --> 12:53.816
into early retirement.

12:53.860 --> 12:54.904
You mean men like you?

12:56.340 --> 12:59.126
Okay.

12:59.169 --> 13:02.825
Since we're all spinning stories
about who he might be,

13:02.869 --> 13:03.826
I'd like to try one

13:03.870 --> 13:05.741
that isn't based on

13:05.785 --> 13:07.830
a tired stereotype.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.832
How about Tim Colvin

13:09.876 --> 13:12.530
is a levelheaded young man
who walks away from an argument

13:12.574 --> 13:14.010
before it gets too heated?

13:14.054 --> 13:16.317
We know he's upset
with his fiancÃ©e,

13:16.360 --> 13:18.188
who's Black.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.364
Why not go out and kill someone
who looks like her?

13:20.408 --> 13:22.845
That same fiancÃ©e,
I might add,

13:22.889 --> 13:26.196
was standing by him
every day in court.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.765
Yeah, but can you ever
really know someone?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.941
I had an ex
who cured me of that.
Hmm.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.552
If my husband was ever accused
of something like this,

13:34.596 --> 13:36.467
I'd put him
in the chair myself.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.427
And this idea that-that Tim

13:39.470 --> 13:43.126
drugged Sarah
with a glass of water...

13:43.170 --> 13:45.563
If he was so upset
when he left the house

13:45.607 --> 13:47.130
he forgot his phone,

13:47.174 --> 13:50.873
why would he think to bring
a Vexinax?

13:50.917 --> 13:52.614
He could've had one
in his pocket.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.355
He dissolves it
in the glass of water,

13:54.398 --> 13:56.487
hands it to Sarah-- easy.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.054
Vexinax doesn't dissolve.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.189
I got a prescription for it

14:02.232 --> 14:03.886
when I was going
through my divorce.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.193
I don't like taking pills,
so I tried it once.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.108
Didn't work.JI-Wait.

14:08.151 --> 14:11.024
So that means he would've had to
be carrying a Vexinax pill

14:11.067 --> 14:12.764
that he'd already crushed up
when he saw Sarah.

14:12.808 --> 14:13.765
So?

14:13.809 --> 14:15.419
That doesn't exactly line up

14:15.463 --> 14:16.943
with the prosecution's story

14:16.986 --> 14:19.162
that this was a crime
of opportunity.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.598
You knew this all along.

14:21.730 --> 14:24.080
Why would you vote guilty?

14:24.124 --> 14:26.169
There was so much
other evidence.

14:26.213 --> 14:29.477
He was seen at the bar.
He was at her building.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.653
No, no, no, no. She's right.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.220
So, the prosecution was wrong
about it being

14:33.263 --> 14:34.438
a crime of opportunity.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.658
So what?

14:36.701 --> 14:38.660
So now I'm wondering
what else they were wrong about.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.752
The thing I keep
bumping up against is,

14:43.795 --> 14:46.015
why would Sarah take a pill
from a total stranger?

14:46.059 --> 14:47.669
They're assuming
he spiked her drink.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.976
No, I looked it up.
Vexinax isn't soluble.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.630
I wonder if the jury knows that.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.719
And would a prescription
antianxiety pill

14:54.763 --> 14:55.851
be his drug of choice?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.635
I mean, Rohypnol, GHB,

14:57.679 --> 14:59.550
even ketamine would be
better options.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.422
Well, it got into her system
somehow.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.858
And, according to
the police report,

15:02.902 --> 15:04.642
Sarah didn't have
a prescription.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.557
Either she took it willingly
or somebody slipped it to her,

15:06.601 --> 15:08.081
and if it wasn't Tim,
then who was it?

15:08.124 --> 15:11.388
We need to know
who Sarah saw that night,

15:11.432 --> 15:14.957
and if she spent time
with anyone else at that bar.

15:15.001 --> 15:15.915
She was there
with her roommate, Olivia.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.134
Maybe she can shed some light.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.484
Olivia Simmons?

15:21.703 --> 15:23.748
Cynthia Westfield.
D.A.'s office.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.141
Can we talk?

15:27.317 --> 15:29.102
No, it was just us at the bar.

15:29.145 --> 15:31.843
The place was filled
with finance bros.

15:31.887 --> 15:34.063
Not our scene.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.978
So, other than Tim Colvin, you
didn't see her with anyone else?

15:37.023 --> 15:39.721
No. Why?

15:39.764 --> 15:41.157
New evidence has come to light

15:41.201 --> 15:42.942
about how the Vexinax got
into her system.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.815
What'd you mean that
it wasn't your scene?

15:47.947 --> 15:51.167
We were just looking to chill,

15:51.211 --> 15:53.865
then the place got packed
for the game.

15:53.909 --> 15:56.172
Not a fan of crowds, huh?

15:56.216 --> 15:58.696
Guys yelling.
Everybody bumping into you.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.742
Must've been stressful.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.137
We think Sarah may have
gotten the pills

16:04.180 --> 16:05.747
from someone
she might have trusted.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.838
Olivia, I'm not a cop.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.709
And you were never asked about

16:11.753 --> 16:13.059
where Sarah got the drugs,

16:13.102 --> 16:15.017
so technically,
you didn't lie.

16:15.061 --> 16:18.281
But you didn't exactly tell
the whole truth, did you?

16:18.325 --> 16:20.980
The crowd was
making Sarah anxious,

16:21.023 --> 16:23.983
so I gave her one of my pills.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.985
And you didn't say anything
because...

16:26.028 --> 16:27.899
Everyone would've thought
it was my fault.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.337
Maybe if I hadn't given it
to her,

16:30.380 --> 16:32.556
she wouldn't have been
so vulnerable.

16:34.384 --> 16:35.733
Maybe she would still be alive.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.648
I just thought that

16:37.692 --> 16:39.346
since they got the guy...

16:39.389 --> 16:42.218
What made you so sure
that Tim was the guy,

16:42.262 --> 16:43.741
knowing he didn't give her
the drugs?

16:43.785 --> 16:45.961
He was in our building.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.399
The cops showed me his picture.
I recognized him.

16:49.443 --> 16:52.054
How many drinks had you had
when you saw them talking?

16:52.098 --> 16:54.143
Not too many because I-I...

16:54.187 --> 16:56.145
'Cause you had taken a Vexinax,
too.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.193
You're still sure it was him?

17:00.236 --> 17:02.804
He was at our building.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.327
He's the guy.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.200
Right?

17:08.897 --> 17:09.854
It bears questioning.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.334
I've had my doubts

17:11.378 --> 17:12.683
about the eyewitness account
from the start.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.599
It was dim in the bar
and dark outside.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.079
She has twenty-twenty vision.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.646
They made a point of that.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.170
She was also 30 feet away
through a crowded bar.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.607
Olivia also testified,
under oath,

17:23.651 --> 17:25.870
that it was Tim she saw
talking to Sarah.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.872
She has no doubt in her mind.

17:27.916 --> 17:28.873
Are you saying she's lying?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.875
No, but what I am saying is that

17:30.919 --> 17:34.401
maybe she believed she saw
something that she didn't.

17:34.444 --> 17:37.447
The girl was traumatized from
finding her friend murdered.

17:37.491 --> 17:40.363
A police officer shows her
a photo of a Black suspect.

17:40.407 --> 17:43.236
The man Sarah was talking to
at the bar is Black.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.847
Her brain fills in the rest.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.415
Oh, so now we're just
making up reasons

17:48.458 --> 17:50.243
why the evidence
doesn't point to him.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.940
No, we're just looking
at possibilities,

17:51.983 --> 17:53.115
and we haven't even
taken into account

17:53.159 --> 17:55.030
that cross-racial
identifications

17:55.074 --> 17:57.380
are historically inaccurate.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.817
"Cross-racial identifications"?

17:59.861 --> 18:02.603
Uh, she is saying that
all white people are so racist

18:02.646 --> 18:04.909
that they can't
tell Black people apart.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.824
That is not what I'm saying.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.435
And for the record,
I'm insulted.

18:08.478 --> 18:11.133
Howard, this is not
a personal attack.

18:11.177 --> 18:14.180
It is just the way
our brains work.

18:14.223 --> 18:15.529
She's right.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.052
42% of wrongful convictions

18:17.096 --> 18:18.836
based on eyewitness testimonies

18:18.880 --> 18:20.621
are cross-racial
misidentifications.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.276
How do you know that?

18:23.319 --> 18:24.886
I saw an infographic
on Instagram.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.496
So, what?

18:26.540 --> 18:28.150
Now you think this guy's
innocent, too?

18:28.194 --> 18:30.152
I don't know.

18:33.024 --> 18:33.982
She was your age, you know.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.767
The girl

18:36.811 --> 18:38.465
who was raped
and strangled to death.

18:39.770 --> 18:40.989
And you're ready

18:41.032 --> 18:42.556
to let her killer go free.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.908
Or maybe you are,
by convicting an innocent man.

18:50.346 --> 18:54.133
Well, Olivia saw someone
talking to Sarah that night.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.746
All right, this is everybody
who used a credit card

18:58.789 --> 19:00.356
at the bar that night.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.533
No Tim and no one Olivia
would mistake for Tim.

19:03.577 --> 19:04.882
Any company cards?

19:04.926 --> 19:06.884
Uh, yeah. There's a couple.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.190
Any big tabs?

19:08.234 --> 19:09.887
This one's over a grand.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.324
They may have been
having a party.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.282
Harry, check the company roster.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.545
See if there's anyone
who might've been at that party

19:15.589 --> 19:17.808
who could've been mistaken
for Tim Colvin.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.815
Devin Ellis?

19:24.859 --> 19:26.991
You got a minute?What the hell?

19:27.035 --> 19:28.863
Hey, do you remember going to
a company party

19:28.906 --> 19:30.517
about eight months ago?

19:30.560 --> 19:32.823
At a bar downtown
called The King George.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.608
You recall talking to
a blonde girl outside?

19:37.132 --> 19:39.178
Sarah Ross.
This is the picture

19:39.221 --> 19:40.353
they showed of her
all over the news

19:40.396 --> 19:42.268
when she was murdered
later that night.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.008
Why? Who are you?

19:44.052 --> 19:45.184
Friend of the family.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.750
And before you say anything,

19:46.794 --> 19:47.838
I talked to your colleagues,

19:47.882 --> 19:49.797
so I know you were there.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.584
Look, I talked to her, okay?

19:54.628 --> 19:56.238
Frankly, she looked wasted,

19:56.282 --> 19:57.935
so I offered her
a glass of water,

19:57.979 --> 20:00.286
but I had nothing to do
with her murder.

20:00.329 --> 20:03.202
Ask anyone I work with,
they'll tell you.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.247
I was at the party
when she was killed.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.206
Sounds like you've given this
a lot of thought.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.860
You heard about the murder
back then.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.907
You knew this whole case was
being built on bad information.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.257
Why wouldn't you come forward
when you knew you had an alibi?

20:15.301 --> 20:16.737
You think an alibi means a damn

20:16.780 --> 20:18.347
when they got
a dead white woman?

20:18.391 --> 20:20.262
I can easily be the one
on trial today.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.524
But you're not.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.047
And at any minute,

20:23.091 --> 20:24.353
an innocent man could be
sent to prison

20:24.397 --> 20:26.747
for something he didn't do.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.531
I'm sorry,

20:28.575 --> 20:30.925
but I got a family who needs me.

20:30.968 --> 20:33.232
If you want to help your guy,
you got to do it on your own.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.984
D.A. Grafton's agreed to meet
with me tomorrow morning.

20:47.028 --> 20:49.117
Maybe she can intercede
with the prosecutor.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.902
Well, you did just punch
a giant hole in the case.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.296
Yeah, but Devin still won't
come forward,

20:54.340 --> 20:56.124
even though his alibi
checked out.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.256
Can't say I blame him.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.779
And if it wasn't
for your aunt,

20:58.822 --> 21:00.259
"not talking to you"
about the trial,

21:00.302 --> 21:01.390
we wouldn't even know that.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.826
Does your aunt know
how right she was

21:02.870 --> 21:03.566
to fight for this guy?

21:03.610 --> 21:05.829
Not yet.

21:05.873 --> 21:09.485
But Aunt Vi has never needed
a reason to do what's right.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.008
What time is it?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.881
30.

21:13.924 --> 21:16.100
We're just going nowhere fast.

21:16.144 --> 21:19.278
I say we go home,
get some sleep.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.584
Come back at this fresh
tomorrow.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.456
You know, some of us have jobs.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.328
Why don't we just
tell the judge the truth:

21:26.372 --> 21:28.156
we're deadlocked.

21:28.199 --> 21:30.071
He'll get a new trial,
be found guilty, like he should.

21:30.114 --> 21:32.421
You think you can't afford
to miss a day's work?

21:33.727 --> 21:35.816
Try paying a defense attorney
for a second trial.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.296
You know what?

21:37.339 --> 21:38.819
I think you have
too much time on your hands.

21:38.862 --> 21:39.994
You might not want to get
back to your husband,

21:40.037 --> 21:41.430
but the rest of us do.

21:41.474 --> 21:42.301
I don't have a husband,
sweetheart.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.389
I'm not married.

21:43.432 --> 21:44.912
Yes, you do. You said...

21:44.955 --> 21:46.174
That was me.

21:46.217 --> 21:47.697
The other Black woman.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.744
Really?

21:51.832 --> 21:53.747
No.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.226
We've been together two weeks,
and you just...

21:55.270 --> 21:56.837
confused us.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.146
Which is my point.

22:03.887 --> 22:04.932
Isn't it possible

22:04.975 --> 22:07.369
that Sarah's roommate

22:07.413 --> 22:09.458
misidentified Tim?

22:11.765 --> 22:14.637
That she saw
a different Black man

22:14.681 --> 22:16.770
talking to Sarah that night?

22:18.032 --> 22:21.992
And isn't it possible
that when Tim says

22:22.036 --> 22:25.344
he wasn't at that bar,

22:25.387 --> 22:28.738
that he's actually
telling the truth?

22:32.046 --> 22:34.309
Well, there she goes
again, playing the race card.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.703
This is about race.

22:36.746 --> 22:40.402
This is a Black man on trial
for raping a white woman.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.100
No, this is about a man

22:43.144 --> 22:45.364
who was seen running
from a building

22:45.407 --> 22:47.104
where a girl was killed inside.

22:47.148 --> 22:48.802
Now,

22:48.845 --> 22:51.413
we were instructed to be honest,

22:51.457 --> 22:53.720
conscientious and unbiased.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.940
And now you're dragging
his race into it.

22:56.984 --> 23:00.944
To be intentionally blind to
the historical precedent here

23:00.988 --> 23:03.556
is the most dangerous bias
of all.

23:03.599 --> 23:05.296
And what about you?

23:05.340 --> 23:07.429
Isn't it possible

23:07.473 --> 23:10.084
that you have
some baggage of your own

23:10.127 --> 23:13.043
that is making you overlook
some pretty damning evidence?

23:13.087 --> 23:15.568
And isn't it possible

23:15.611 --> 23:17.308
that this is about
you being a Black woman,

23:17.352 --> 23:19.441
trying to protect her own?

23:19.485 --> 23:22.401
And wouldn't it be a shame

23:22.444 --> 23:26.056
if we didn't convict
a rapist and a murderer

23:26.100 --> 23:29.146
because your bias
got in the way?

23:34.587 --> 23:36.153
That you, Auntie?

23:36.197 --> 23:38.721
Boy, they got you working
like crazy down there.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.116
Hey.

23:42.159 --> 23:43.465
Come here. Sit down.

23:44.858 --> 23:46.990
What happened?Nothing yet.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.470
No decision.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.646
Well, at least
you got them talking.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.256
Yeah, well...

23:52.300 --> 23:54.389
maybe they shouldn't be.

23:55.390 --> 23:56.652
What do you mean?

23:56.696 --> 23:59.263
What if I'm wrong
about this guy?

23:59.307 --> 24:01.614
What if when I look at him,
all I see are...

24:01.657 --> 24:04.834
are the Black men behind bars
that shouldn't be there?

24:04.878 --> 24:08.708
I don't want to be responsible
for setting someone free

24:08.751 --> 24:10.666
who may have raped
and killed a woman.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.495
Auntie, you know
your initial doubt

24:13.539 --> 24:14.801
about the prosecution's case?

24:14.844 --> 24:16.585
Mm-hmm.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.240
I would stick with it.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.462
Trust your gut.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.637
Robyn?

24:26.508 --> 24:27.988
I'm going to bed.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.816
Love you.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.870
Where are my boys?

24:40.914 --> 24:43.046
I'm afraid of
who I might become.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.383
What you're telling me
is concerning

25:15.426 --> 25:16.471
but not actionable.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.907
The defendant was
at the building

25:17.951 --> 25:18.865
where and when
the murder took place,

25:18.908 --> 25:19.953
by his own admission.

25:19.996 --> 25:21.171
But not at the bar.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.738
The jury is deciding

25:22.782 --> 25:25.828
this man's fate based off
a faulty narrative.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.264
I'm sympathetic,

25:27.308 --> 25:28.788
and the narrative
might be imperfect,

25:28.831 --> 25:29.702
but there are other aspects
of the case

25:29.745 --> 25:31.355
that tie him to the crime.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.444
If he is unfairly convicted,
he can appeal.

25:33.488 --> 25:35.969
You're joking, right?

25:36.012 --> 25:38.972
Only thing harder than winning
an appeal is being granted one.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.976
Unless you can find
exculpatory evidence

25:43.019 --> 25:44.586
that Tim Colvin didn't kill

25:44.630 --> 25:46.545
Sarah Ross,

25:46.588 --> 25:48.068
there's nothing I can do.

25:50.679 --> 25:51.724
I'm sorry.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.555
Unreal.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.339
Trials really are about
who spins the best story.

25:58.382 --> 26:00.689
How are we supposed to prove
Tim didn't do this?

26:00.733 --> 26:02.691
By finding the person who did.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.873
It's hard to imagine
having your whole life

26:10.917 --> 26:12.745
ripped out from under you
just because you were

26:12.788 --> 26:13.789
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.182
And we have no way
to exonerate him

26:15.225 --> 26:16.618
unless we find
the real killer.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.098
With virtually
no evidence to go on.

26:18.141 --> 26:19.142
I mean, the only thing
we know at this point

26:19.186 --> 26:20.230
is what didn't happen.

26:20.274 --> 26:22.450
There's always a move.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.583
If the bar is not relevant,

26:24.626 --> 26:26.323
then it's all about
the building.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.674
Which key witnesses were there?
I want to talk to them.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.066
Well, by his own admission,
there's Tim.

26:30.110 --> 26:31.328
I tried.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.243
They have him locked down.

26:33.287 --> 26:35.202
What about the witness
who saw him running to the cab?

26:35.245 --> 26:36.812
Christian Messina.

26:36.856 --> 26:38.248
Sarah's downstairs neighbor.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.686
Okay. That's our move.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.559
Minute to talk, Kerry?

26:44.603 --> 26:46.866
That depends.

26:46.909 --> 26:49.346
You here to put away
another one of my clients?

26:49.390 --> 26:50.957
Just a temperature check.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.002
Tim Colvin.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.787
I know you go to the mat
for everyone you represent,

26:54.830 --> 26:56.615
but what's your honest
feeling on him?

26:56.658 --> 26:59.313
I think he's innocent. Why?

26:59.356 --> 27:01.141
Been looking into it.

27:01.184 --> 27:04.057
Bit late for police to be
auditing casework, isn't it?

27:05.406 --> 27:06.799
I'm not police anymore.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.367
Not after...

27:10.411 --> 27:12.935
The fact that all that
still goes on.

27:14.415 --> 27:16.286
But you left?

27:16.330 --> 27:17.853
What was it you said
that one time?

27:17.897 --> 27:19.202
If you never saw me
in court again,

27:19.246 --> 27:20.421
it would be too soon?

27:20.464 --> 27:22.205
Much as I hate to admit it,

27:22.249 --> 27:24.643
I'd rather bust my ass
going up against cases

27:24.686 --> 27:26.383
built by cops like you.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.473
At least it's a fair fight.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.562
Is it ever really fair?

27:31.606 --> 27:32.868
Is anything?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.657
How do you keep doing it?

27:38.700 --> 27:40.397
Knowing how the system can be?

27:42.443 --> 27:44.401
If not me, then who?

27:48.231 --> 27:50.494
Can you get me in to see Tim?

27:50.538 --> 27:52.235
I might know someone
who can help.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.282
Yeah, let me see what I can do.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.025
Hell of a thing.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.940
You know if I didn't see him
get in that cab,

28:00.983 --> 28:03.029
they probably would've
never tracked him down.

28:03.072 --> 28:04.857
I hope they throw the book
at him.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.989
Sarah's family does, too,
Christian.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.295
But if he appeals,

28:08.338 --> 28:09.688
they want to make sure
there's nothing

28:09.731 --> 28:11.341
that'll surprise them
in the next trial.

28:11.385 --> 28:12.908
Is there anything else

28:12.952 --> 28:14.344
you might have seen
or heard that night?

28:14.388 --> 28:16.216
I said it all on the stand.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.739
I was home
watching the football game.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.088
I made myself some tea
before bed,

28:19.132 --> 28:20.568
and that's when I looked
out my window.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.222
From the basement window
in the front

28:22.265 --> 28:23.266
that looks out onto the street?

28:23.310 --> 28:24.485
That's right,

28:24.528 --> 28:26.269
and I saw a guy running out.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.619
He got in a cab,
and that was at midnight.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.058
Sorry.

28:32.101 --> 28:33.712
Landlord is a cheapskate.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.148
A year ago, he put
all the building lights

28:35.191 --> 28:37.716
on motion sensors
with ridiculously short timers.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.805
Anyway, cops ran the cab
and caught the guy.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.241
Showed me a photo
and it was him.

28:41.284 --> 28:42.764
End of story.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.772
How can you accept

28:50.816 --> 28:52.687
that he couldn't remember
where he walked that night?

28:52.731 --> 28:55.690
He said he was angry
and in his own head.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.736
Hasn't that
ever happened to you?

28:57.779 --> 28:59.650
Oh, hell, I remember
where I was that night,

28:59.694 --> 29:00.956
and it was eight months ago.

29:02.088 --> 29:03.089
Watching the Giants comeback.

29:03.132 --> 29:04.873
Killer game.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.701
Went into overtime,
Giants intercepted?Yep.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.311
I was at the bar
late that night.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.183
Giants threw that Hail Mary.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.576
Boom. Tied it all up.Guys.

29:12.620 --> 29:13.708
He's right.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.710
Can we just focus, please?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.581
That Giants game did go
to overtime.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.280
Those games, do they air
on the same network

29:20.323 --> 29:22.935
as the-the show the neighbor
was watching?

29:22.978 --> 29:25.111
Yeah. So, what?So...

29:25.154 --> 29:26.895
the neighbor said she heard
the scream

29:26.939 --> 29:30.725
from Sarah's apartment
at30.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.640
She knew exactly
what time it was

29:32.683 --> 29:34.337
because that's the time
that her show normally starts.

29:34.381 --> 29:35.425
What are you getting at?

29:35.469 --> 29:36.949
It didn't start at30.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.864
If the game went
into overtime,

29:38.907 --> 29:40.822
then the game

29:40.866 --> 29:43.303
pushed back the start
of the show.

29:44.608 --> 29:47.437
Which means the scream could
have happened later than30.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.091
JI-
Way later.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.527
That overtime could've
easily lasted half an hour

29:50.571 --> 29:51.311
with all the time-outs
they called.

29:51.354 --> 29:52.921
Yes.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.968
And Tim was seen running
for a cab at midnight,

29:56.011 --> 29:58.361
which means
the scream could have happened

29:58.405 --> 30:00.755
when he was already in the cab.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.104
Look.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.585
We are not allowed
to look it up.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.848
And if it was shorter
than half an hour,

30:06.892 --> 30:08.981
he was still in the building
when she screamed.

30:09.024 --> 30:11.200
That's true.

30:11.244 --> 30:13.333
But that would mean

30:13.376 --> 30:15.465
he had to rape
and kill Sarah,

30:15.509 --> 30:17.598
clean the apartment
of all the evidence,

30:17.641 --> 30:19.252
get downstairs,

30:19.295 --> 30:23.169
hail a cab in mere minutes.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.648
Is it possible
that he did it?

30:25.954 --> 30:26.955
Sure.

30:26.999 --> 30:29.131
But is it reasonable

30:29.175 --> 30:31.830
to doubt that he did?

30:44.190 --> 30:45.669
It is.

30:45.713 --> 30:47.889
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.500
I'm changing my vote
to "not guilty."

30:54.461 --> 30:56.463
Same with me.

30:56.506 --> 30:57.943
Me, too.

30:57.986 --> 30:59.422
I will, too.

30:59.466 --> 31:00.859
And me.

31:05.254 --> 31:07.778
And you're 100% sure

31:07.822 --> 31:09.998
he could've done all of that

31:10.042 --> 31:11.478
in just a few minutes?

31:21.270 --> 31:23.011
No.

31:23.055 --> 31:24.404
I'm not.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.321
I think we
take a break now,

31:28.364 --> 31:31.019
then come back
and take another vote,

31:31.063 --> 31:32.978
since it seems like

31:33.021 --> 31:34.980
we're all on the same page now.

31:40.246 --> 31:42.335
Dante, what's up?

31:42.378 --> 31:43.902
I got you a meeting
with Tim Colvin.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.425
What happened to "taking time"?

31:45.468 --> 31:46.513
Don't read into it.

31:46.556 --> 31:47.775
Wouldn't dare.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.516
But I'm glad you did.

31:49.559 --> 31:50.996
I have a few questions for Tim.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.475
What's wrong?

31:52.519 --> 31:54.390
In his testimony,

31:54.434 --> 31:56.349
Tim said Sarah's building
looked warm and inviting,

31:56.392 --> 31:58.133
which is why he ducked in,

31:58.177 --> 32:00.919
but the indoor lights are
on motion sensors.

32:00.962 --> 32:03.008
So if no one was
coming or going,

32:03.051 --> 32:04.705
it would've looked
cold and dark,

32:04.748 --> 32:06.750
which means he lied.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.448
Why would he lie about that?

32:08.491 --> 32:10.319
Maybe because someone was there.

32:10.363 --> 32:11.973
Maybe because he actually did

32:12.017 --> 32:13.975
follow Sarah into the building.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.238
Maybe he's not innocent at all.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.681
What was I supposed to do?

32:24.725 --> 32:25.769
Tell the truth?

32:25.813 --> 32:28.816
The cops had me at the scene.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.687
I didn't even tell my attorney.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.472
Well, since we're not cops,

32:32.515 --> 32:34.474
why don't you tell us
what really happened.

32:36.302 --> 32:38.695
Sarah did let me
into the building that night.

32:38.739 --> 32:41.089
She was drunk and heading in.

32:41.133 --> 32:44.179
And it looked warm,
so I followed her in.

32:44.223 --> 32:47.008
And I asked if she was okay,
and she said she was fine,

32:47.052 --> 32:48.705
and then she headed
up the stairs.

32:48.749 --> 32:49.880
You know how that sounds.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.404
Of course I do.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.407
But I didn't kill her.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.757
You know what
they were arresting me for.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.325
If I had admitted
that she let me in that night,

32:59.368 --> 33:01.022
I would've been digging
my own grave.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.111
What happened
after she let you in?

33:03.155 --> 33:05.853
She went on her way,

33:05.896 --> 33:07.376
and I stayed in the vestibule,

33:07.420 --> 33:09.335
warming up
until I caught the cab.

33:09.378 --> 33:11.815
I know I shouldn't have lied,

33:11.859 --> 33:13.992
but I'm not the only one.

33:15.471 --> 33:18.518
I heard the prosecution's
narrative in the court.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.001
You know what they're doing.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.350
I do know.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.004
I keep thinking,

33:26.047 --> 33:28.093
if I hadn't fought
with Morgan that night,

33:28.136 --> 33:31.052
hadn't gone in that building,

33:31.096 --> 33:33.011
hadn't tripped on that trash
and cut my hand

33:33.054 --> 33:34.447
while running to catch the cab,

33:34.490 --> 33:36.362
maybe I wouldn't be here
right now.

33:36.405 --> 33:39.582
Wait, what'd you say
you tripped over?

33:39.626 --> 33:41.976
Garbage day is Tuesday.
So what?

33:43.325 --> 33:46.154
So they would've put the bags
out on the street on Monday.

33:46.198 --> 33:48.461
Same night Sarah was murdered.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.724
Harry, can you find me photos
from Sarah's street

33:50.767 --> 33:52.639
from last Monday night?Yeah, they just put
a new street cam up

33:52.682 --> 33:53.988
a couple months ago.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.121
Here we go.

33:56.164 --> 33:57.600
So, this is what it
would have looked like

33:57.644 --> 33:59.037
the night Tim ran for the cab.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.864
What are we looking for?That.

34:00.908 --> 34:03.171
Christian's window.
You see it?

34:03.215 --> 34:05.173
The garbage is blocking
the view.

34:05.217 --> 34:06.566
So Christian wouldn't
have been able

34:06.609 --> 34:09.003
to see Tim
run for the cab.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.613
But Christian did see Tim.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.659
ID'ing the cab was
how the cops found him.

34:12.702 --> 34:15.096
Well, why would Christian lie
about where he saw him from?

34:16.271 --> 34:18.230
Harry, run a background check
on Christian.

34:18.273 --> 34:19.666
And hurry up.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.668
Aunt Vi's running out of time.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.456
Seems like we're all
in agreement.

34:27.500 --> 34:28.849
So...

34:28.892 --> 34:30.285
all voting to acquit?

34:32.896 --> 34:34.507
Oh, please.

34:34.550 --> 34:36.422
No.

34:36.465 --> 34:38.250
You're still voting "guilty"?

34:38.293 --> 34:40.730
But we just blew holes
through every piece of evidence.

34:40.774 --> 34:42.645
You can twist the evidence
any way you want.

34:42.689 --> 34:43.907
To me, it is
what it is.

34:43.951 --> 34:46.432
But we can't be sure it is.

34:46.475 --> 34:48.869
Yeah. No one's saying
they're sure he's innocent,

34:48.912 --> 34:50.088
but it's reasonable to think

34:50.131 --> 34:51.915
he might not have done it.Thanks.

34:51.959 --> 34:54.048
I do understand the concept
of "reasonable doubt."

34:54.092 --> 34:55.832
Look, why don't we
go over it again.

34:55.876 --> 34:57.486
Maybe if we just...No.

34:58.705 --> 35:00.141
I don't need to go
over it again.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.622
I don't need it to
be explained to me.

35:02.665 --> 35:05.799
I know guys like this,
and I see him for who he is.

35:07.801 --> 35:09.542
Jurors.

35:09.585 --> 35:11.631
The judge is asking if
you're approaching a decision.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.502
Uh...

35:13.546 --> 35:15.287
Could we just have
another minute?

35:25.558 --> 35:27.777
You said you see him
for who he is.

35:28.996 --> 35:30.084
Who is that?

35:30.128 --> 35:33.043
Someone who hurt you?

35:33.087 --> 35:34.871
Someone who lied to you, someone

35:34.915 --> 35:36.917
Who broke your trust?

35:36.960 --> 35:38.136
That person isn't Tim.

35:40.268 --> 35:41.791
He's not your ex.

35:41.835 --> 35:43.097
You don't know
what you're talking about.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.794
And you won't
change my mind.

35:44.838 --> 35:46.187
I'm not gonna try.

35:46.231 --> 35:49.495
All I've ever asked of
anyone here is

35:49.538 --> 35:53.063
to scrutinize the evidence
with care,

35:53.107 --> 35:55.327
and then vote your conscience.

35:55.370 --> 35:58.112
So...

35:58.156 --> 36:01.333
if you truly think
that Tim is guilty,

36:01.376 --> 36:04.727
then you should stand
in that truth

36:04.771 --> 36:06.294
and vote that way.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.605
All right, so Christian
looks clean, right?

36:12.648 --> 36:14.346
But you dig a little deeper,
you're gonna discover

36:14.389 --> 36:15.912
that he was part of a fraternity
ten years ago

36:15.956 --> 36:17.827
that dissolved
after rape allegations surfaced.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.394
NDAs?Yeah. Exactly.

36:19.438 --> 36:20.700
No suspects were ever named.

36:20.743 --> 36:22.136
Then a few years ago,

36:22.180 --> 36:23.790
he was living in
an apartment building

36:23.833 --> 36:24.834
where a woman was attacked
and killed in the stairwell.

36:24.878 --> 36:26.662
Case went unsolved.

36:26.706 --> 36:29.230
Okay, so we know Christian
saw Tim get in the cab,

36:29.274 --> 36:31.232
but he wasn't in his apartment.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.930
And he wasn't in the foyer,
because Tim would've seen him.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.280
But there's one other place
he could've been.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.064
Oh, God.Harry.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.330
There's a clear line of sight

36:42.374 --> 36:43.592
from Sarah's apartment
to the street.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.551
That's why Christian lied.

36:45.594 --> 36:47.379
He should be the one on trial.

36:47.422 --> 36:48.771
Speaking of which,
they're calling the jury

36:48.815 --> 36:50.382
back in, looks like
they have a verdict.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.344
I know that look.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.433
I got a real suspect.

36:58.477 --> 37:01.610
He looks good for it
but nothing concrete.

37:01.654 --> 37:05.527
So, I guess it's all
in the hands of the jury.

37:20.673 --> 37:22.544
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:22.588 --> 37:23.893
welcome back.
Mr. Desoto,

37:23.937 --> 37:26.853
you are the jury foreperson,
correct?

37:26.896 --> 37:28.768
Yes, Your Honor.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.117
I understand you've been unable

37:30.160 --> 37:31.814
to reach a verdict
on either charge.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.251
Is that the case?

37:33.294 --> 37:34.774
At least it's not "guilty."

37:34.817 --> 37:36.210
Yeah, but if the next jury
is not willing

37:36.254 --> 37:37.603
to ask the hard questions,

37:37.646 --> 37:39.344
odds are,

37:39.387 --> 37:41.302
he'll be convicted.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.695
Mr. Desoto,
if I were to return you

37:42.738 --> 37:45.306
to the jury room,
do you think

37:45.350 --> 37:46.655
you could make progress
towards a verdict?

37:51.878 --> 37:53.619
No, Your Honor.

37:53.662 --> 37:56.317
I want to remind you all
of your duty to this court.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.624
And that is,
for you all to decide

37:58.667 --> 38:00.495
the case for yourself.

38:01.757 --> 38:04.020
Now, with that said,
your jury foreperson

38:04.064 --> 38:07.110
has stated that you've done
all you can to reach a verdict.

38:07.154 --> 38:10.679
If any of you disagree
with that,

38:10.723 --> 38:12.377
you'd better tell me now.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.348
In that case...

38:27.392 --> 38:28.523
Wait.

38:32.135 --> 38:33.267
I want to change my vote.

38:38.141 --> 38:39.534
Mr. Desoto, it appears

38:39.578 --> 38:41.231
to me that
from your correspondence

38:41.275 --> 38:43.103
on behalf of all the jurors

38:43.146 --> 38:44.670
that this makes
the jury's verdict

38:44.713 --> 38:46.846
on both charges unanimous.

38:46.889 --> 38:48.326
Uh...

38:48.369 --> 38:49.501
Yes, Your Honor.

38:50.893 --> 38:52.286
And what is that verdict?

38:53.722 --> 38:54.723
Not guilty.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.551
In that case,

38:56.595 --> 38:57.683
ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

38:57.726 --> 38:59.467
this case has now concluded,

38:59.511 --> 39:00.555
and the court wishes
to express its appreciation

39:00.599 --> 39:02.296
to you for your services.

39:04.254 --> 39:06.779
Mr. Colvin,
you are free to go.

39:09.608 --> 39:10.696
All rise.

39:32.195 --> 39:33.762
Thanks for the assist today.

39:33.806 --> 39:36.156
And for what it's worth,

39:36.199 --> 39:38.245
I think you'd make
a great lawyer.

39:39.899 --> 39:41.204
Hmm.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.344
Congratulations.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.999
Jury got it right this time.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.131
Which means there's a guilty
man walking around out there.

39:55.175 --> 39:58.134
And there will continue to be.

39:58.178 --> 40:00.528
They think they got it right.
The A.D.A., the NYPD--

40:00.572 --> 40:02.269
they think Tim got

40:02.312 --> 40:05.446
a get-out-of-jail-free
card today.

40:05.490 --> 40:07.100
Which means this case
will never be reinvestigated,

40:07.143 --> 40:08.406
and Sarah's family

40:08.449 --> 40:10.538
will never get
any kind of closure.

40:32.386 --> 40:33.431
Mom?

40:33.474 --> 40:34.606
Hey, Dad's almost here.

40:34.649 --> 40:35.650
I'm gonna wait for him
outside.

40:35.694 --> 40:37.304
Okay. Hey, hold up a second.

40:41.961 --> 40:44.180
I want to apologize
for putting you in a position

40:44.224 --> 40:45.747
to have to lie to your father.

40:45.791 --> 40:48.271
Mom, I told you.
It is not a big deal.

40:48.315 --> 40:50.012
It is a big deal.

40:50.056 --> 40:52.493
It's true
that lies can be necessary

40:52.537 --> 40:54.060
to protect your family,

40:54.103 --> 40:56.671
but they can backfire on you.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.107
They can hurt you
and those around you

40:58.151 --> 41:00.022
in ways you never anticipate.

41:00.066 --> 41:02.111
Lying is dangerous,

41:02.155 --> 41:03.896
and I just want you
to realize that.

41:08.335 --> 41:10.250
Well,

41:10.293 --> 41:11.904
feels more dangerous not to.

41:11.947 --> 41:13.819
But...

41:13.862 --> 41:15.690
I understand.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.344
I do.

41:22.436 --> 41:23.698
Hey, you know how

41:23.742 --> 41:25.483
Dad asked me
if I felt safe here?

41:27.093 --> 41:29.487
I didn't have to lie about that.

41:35.144 --> 41:37.277
Mm.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.369
Hey, Auntie!

41:42.412 --> 41:43.849
How'd deliberations go?

41:43.892 --> 41:46.286
They ended. Not guilty.

41:46.329 --> 41:49.245
Ah!Yeah. Thank goodness.

41:49.289 --> 41:50.508
Wait, so you're back?
That's great.

41:52.074 --> 41:53.815
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
we missed you.

41:53.859 --> 41:56.122
Yeah?

41:56.165 --> 41:58.559
I heard you got mighty familiar
with the laundry room,

41:58.603 --> 42:00.648
so I think I'll just
leave the ironing

42:00.692 --> 42:02.563
for you until you get back
from your dad's.

42:02.607 --> 42:04.826
Yeah, no, I'm good,
but I love you.

42:05.914 --> 42:07.481
I love you, baby, have fun.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.743
I love you, Aunt Vi.I love you more.

42:08.787 --> 42:11.093
Bye.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.838
Well, I can't say
that I was surprised

42:16.882 --> 42:18.710
to see you in the courtroom
today.

42:18.753 --> 42:21.190
I may have followed the case,

42:21.234 --> 42:23.149
but that young man

42:23.192 --> 42:25.064
owes his freedom to you.

42:26.065 --> 42:27.545
Well...

42:28.720 --> 42:30.373
I just did what was
required of me.

42:34.769 --> 42:38.077
Now, see, that's what
the world needs more of:

42:38.120 --> 42:40.209
that.

42:40.253 --> 42:43.256
People willing to take
the time and the trouble

42:43.299 --> 42:45.432
to find the truth.

42:51.003 --> 42:53.005
Got a minute?

42:53.048 --> 42:55.007
Detective Dante.

42:55.050 --> 42:56.661
NYPD.

42:56.704 --> 42:58.401
I have a few questions for you.
