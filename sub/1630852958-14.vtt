WEBVTT

00:02.334 --> 00:03.292
No, I did not.

00:03.292 --> 00:06.334
I remember the ----ing
penis in my vagina.

00:06.334 --> 00:13.167
Mm.

00:13.167 --> 00:14.584
-Yeah.
-Meh,

00:14.584 --> 00:16.042
You have my permission
to hook up with a guy

00:16.042 --> 00:18.834
that's gonna treat
you like sh--.

00:18.834 --> 00:20.959
Scarlett, do you mind
checking laundry, please?

00:20.959 --> 00:30.417
Yeah.

00:30.417 --> 00:33.000
And I'm the ----ing
unprofessional one!

00:33.000 --> 00:34.334
Where did this come from?

00:34.334 --> 00:36.167
Everyone has to help tonight.

00:36.167 --> 00:38.167
There's 80 plates.

00:38.167 --> 00:40.167
It's yummy. It's very good.

00:40.167 --> 00:42.959
It's 10 ----ing courses
in a sailing yacht.

00:42.959 --> 00:43.959
It was a lot.

00:43.959 --> 00:45.334
Sh-- yeah, no, that was amazing.

00:45.334 --> 00:47.000
We're gonna get ready
to go sailing.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.167
We're not just gonna be sailing,
we're gonna be racing.

00:49.167 --> 00:50.542
This is what I'm here for.

00:50.542 --> 00:53.417
Let's get this thing
cranked over.

00:53.417 --> 00:55.125
You guys will hear a horn.

00:55.125 --> 00:56.876
When the horn starts,
that's when we'll unfurl

00:56.876 --> 00:58.959
the genoa and start racing.

00:58.959 --> 00:59.959
Okay, honk.

00:59.959 --> 01:04.792
[horn sounds]

01:04.792 --> 01:05.792
Is that the horn to start?

01:05.792 --> 01:08.667
Okay, come on out on the genoa.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.292
Nothing like a friendly race.

01:10.292 --> 01:12.959
No such thing as a friendly.

01:12.959 --> 01:14.083
You will lose.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.751
You happy with that genoa?

01:15.751 --> 01:17.584
Yeah, it looked good.

01:17.584 --> 01:19.292
We'll start...
you feel it?

01:19.292 --> 01:24.083
Look, my angle's starting
to change.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.167
Pretty even so far.

01:26.167 --> 01:29.584
Yeah, man.
This thing sails good.

01:29.584 --> 01:30.959
Hey, papi!

01:30.959 --> 01:32.918
You think we're
gaining on him, or...

01:32.918 --> 01:34.167
Yeah.

01:34.167 --> 01:36.417
-Have you changed the--
-[clattering]

01:36.417 --> 01:39.959
Interior, interior, we've
got some stuff flying around.

01:39.959 --> 01:43.667
Oh, my God.

01:43.667 --> 01:44.959
Are we racing?

01:44.959 --> 01:51.250
Yeah, probably.

01:51.250 --> 01:54.417
Just hope we keep our
speed through the tack here.

01:54.417 --> 01:58.584
Maybe we'll go up a little
on the vang on that mizzen.

01:58.584 --> 02:00.250
How about that?

02:00.250 --> 02:01.250
More, if you can.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.000
-More?
-Looks good.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.667
Oh, he's... look at this, man,
he's gonna spank us hard.

02:09.667 --> 02:11.667
The reason they're pulling away
from us now as we're tacking

02:11.667 --> 02:16.375
is that we're a bigger boat, so
we have a lot more momentum.

02:16.375 --> 02:18.792
When we're turning,
it takes us a little longer.

02:18.792 --> 02:21.626
A lot of people don't really
understand how it all works,

02:21.626 --> 02:23.542
so to get them involved,

02:23.542 --> 02:26.125
it adds that little bit
extra to the experience.

02:26.125 --> 02:27.751
They're beating us now.

02:27.751 --> 02:35.792
-We've lost a lot, man.
-We lost a hell of a lot now.

02:35.792 --> 02:38.083
Barnaby, let's start coming
out on the other sheet.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.792
Kelsie, keep an
eye on that sheet.

02:40.792 --> 02:42.792
Yeah, lets go now.

02:42.792 --> 02:46.375
Okay, go... go, go, go.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.584
I think they have trouble
with the jib,

02:48.584 --> 02:50.167
so they've kinda
slowed down a bit.

02:50.167 --> 02:52.167
So, we have a
chance to catch them.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.167
This is getting very tense.

02:53.167 --> 02:54.167
Come on, baby.

02:54.167 --> 02:56.167
Vamanos, vamanos!

02:56.167 --> 03:01.918
Now we're racing, come on!

03:01.918 --> 03:06.751
This is gonna be
very, very close.

03:06.751 --> 03:09.709
Woohoo!

03:09.709 --> 03:14.667
Barnaby, are we ahead
or are they ahead?

03:14.667 --> 03:17.125
Everyone, blow on the sails!

03:17.125 --> 03:19.959
-Blow on the sail!
-Yeah! Woo!

03:19.959 --> 03:22.959
Okay, we're almost at the line,
have a look down the line.

03:22.959 --> 03:26.709
Woo!

03:26.709 --> 03:28.125
We won, we got this!

03:28.125 --> 03:32.751
[horn sounds]

03:32.751 --> 03:34.709
[ship horn]

03:34.709 --> 03:41.959
[cheering]

03:41.959 --> 03:43.000
That was tight.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.584
That was a photo finish.

03:44.584 --> 03:47.792
My mission is to always deliver
an epic sailing experience.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.000
-We won.
-Yippee!

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
-You have fun?
-So much fun.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.292
That was a good race.

03:51.292 --> 03:54.542
Catching these guys at the line
is kinda like the cherry on top.

03:54.542 --> 03:57.792
You wanted adventure,
you got it.

03:57.792 --> 04:02.667
That was close.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.167
Kelsie, I'm putting
this genoa away.

04:04.167 --> 04:05.959
Can you keep an eye
on the sheets, please?

04:05.959 --> 04:08.834
Yep.

04:08.834 --> 04:10.167
Kelsie, you happy?

04:10.167 --> 04:12.959
Happy. That's good.

04:12.959 --> 04:16.125
Colin, let's fire up,
and let's get outta here.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.959
What a great trip.

04:17.959 --> 04:18.959
Yeah.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.792
I don't wanna go home now.

04:20.792 --> 04:23.459
I wanna move to the Parsifal.

04:23.459 --> 04:28.959
But I think we have
to start packing our stuff.

04:28.959 --> 04:30.959
I know we just
shove it all in.

04:30.959 --> 04:33.959
One, two, three.

04:33.959 --> 04:49.000
I don't know what I ripped,
but it wasn't my bathing suit.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.751
But it's also a big part of,
like,

04:50.751 --> 04:52.000
if you wanna be second stew

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
or if you one day
wanna be chief stew.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.375
No, I know, yeah.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.959
I am trying to teach
the women to be a team,

04:59.959 --> 05:03.959
and of course Gary and
his small dick ruin everything.

05:03.959 --> 05:07.042
And yeah, I'm just stuck
here picking up the pieces.

05:07.042 --> 05:09.334
Oh, I just can't deal
with any more drama.

05:09.334 --> 05:11.042
I don't want anything.

05:11.042 --> 05:13.334
I don't want any, I'm done,
I'm ah!

05:13.334 --> 05:14.209
Good.

05:14.209 --> 05:16.167
I'm not worried
about tonight at all.

05:16.167 --> 05:17.876
-I'm...
-Okay.

05:17.876 --> 05:19.250
You just have to let Ashley know

05:19.250 --> 05:20.959
that you've got
feelings for Scarlett.

05:20.959 --> 05:28.292
Yeah, I'm gonna speak to her.

05:28.292 --> 05:30.417
The one thing I don't
wanna happen again

05:30.417 --> 05:32.501
is for Ashley
to lose her sh--.

05:32.501 --> 05:35.417
I remember the ----ing
penis in my vagina.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.959
Mm-hmm.

05:37.959 --> 05:39.959
-Ooh!
-[vomits]

05:39.959 --> 05:41.876
Gary needs to talk to her ASAP,

05:41.876 --> 05:56.334
or else tonight is gonna be
an absolute sh---show.

05:56.334 --> 05:57.584
Phew.

05:57.584 --> 06:00.375
All right, let me
clean and disconnect

06:00.375 --> 06:02.250
my brain from the galley.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.709
All crew, all crew,
let's get ready to dock.

06:04.709 --> 06:07.959
We'll do the same as usual...
forward running spring on first.

06:07.959 --> 06:09.375
You guys, we're done.

06:09.375 --> 06:11.167
-No!
-I know, it's sad.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.000
About one... five now, 15.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.042
Copy, one-five, thank you.

06:14.042 --> 06:15.501
-You ready to go?
-No.

06:15.501 --> 06:16.709
Aw!

06:16.709 --> 06:19.417
We got to sail today, that
was the most important thing.

06:19.417 --> 06:21.167
Yeah, yeah.

06:21.167 --> 06:27.542
Got about three meters
from the boys, Glenn.

06:27.542 --> 06:30.626
Okay, take up.

06:30.626 --> 06:32.584
Yeah, that's good,
Cap, that's good.

06:32.584 --> 06:34.042
It's so hot.

06:34.042 --> 06:35.459
Not as hot as you, Gary.

06:35.459 --> 06:36.959
Okay, that's main engine off.

06:36.959 --> 06:38.167
We're home!

06:38.167 --> 06:48.125
Like a ----ing boss.

06:48.125 --> 06:50.000
All crew, all crew,
we need to be on the dock

06:50.000 --> 06:53.125
to see off the
guests, thank you.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.542
This line's looking
a little jagged.

06:54.542 --> 06:56.167
This is it.

06:56.167 --> 06:57.667
Are we having fun yet?
I am.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.334
I don't know about you
----ers but I am.

06:59.334 --> 07:01.167
Ah!

07:01.167 --> 07:02.501
Thank you.

07:02.501 --> 07:05.167
[chattering]

07:05.167 --> 07:07.501
-See you next time.
-Bye!

07:07.501 --> 07:09.959
-Thank you guys.
-Thank you so much.

07:09.959 --> 07:11.250
Ah, Keely.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.792
You guys made this
trip so memorable.

07:12.792 --> 07:14.542
The food was amazing,
the service was impeccable.

07:14.542 --> 07:16.167
Thank you guys so much.

07:16.167 --> 07:17.959
Our pleasure...
oh, thank you very much.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.167
That's very kind of you.

07:19.167 --> 07:20.709
-Yep. Bye.
-See you guys later.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.918
-Thanks, guys.
-I'm gonna... keep waving.

07:22.918 --> 07:24.918
Hold the line, hold the line.

07:24.918 --> 07:29.792
[ship honks]

07:29.792 --> 07:33.209
All right, guys.

07:33.209 --> 07:35.959
Okay, let's put covers on.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.250
We'll just work until
the tip meeting.

07:37.250 --> 07:45.959
Oh, God, I'm so happy.

07:45.959 --> 07:47.167
All crew, all crew,

07:47.167 --> 07:49.000
can I get everybody in
the saloon

07:49.000 --> 07:50.834
for a tip meeting, thank you.

07:50.834 --> 07:52.209
-Are we done?
-That's it.

07:52.209 --> 07:56.959
I think we should
just call it a night.

07:56.959 --> 07:58.292
First of all, I wanna just say,

07:58.292 --> 08:00.709
you know, that was
an epic charter.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.083
I think the guests
really enjoyed

08:02.083 --> 08:03.375
the race today, of course.

08:03.375 --> 08:04.751
I'm glad that we got that in,

08:04.751 --> 08:06.375
because they
really wanted to sail.

08:06.375 --> 08:09.792
Scarlett, our newest member,
welcome to the team.

08:09.792 --> 08:11.334
Thanks to everybody.

08:11.334 --> 08:12.876
Yeah?

08:12.876 --> 08:15.834
It was stressful at first,
but I feel so much better.

08:15.834 --> 08:20.083
Marcos, again, dude, you blew me
away with that 10-course meal.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.459
At one point, I kinda
started blurring.

08:22.459 --> 08:26.792
I was like, keep it together,
keep it together.

08:26.792 --> 08:32.167
Finally, to the tip,
the tip total is 16,400.

08:32.167 --> 08:38.375
Each person is 1,820.

08:38.375 --> 08:41.167
You guys, I want you to go out
and enjoy yourselves, have fun.

08:41.167 --> 08:43.375
One for you, thank you.

08:43.375 --> 08:47.918
Yes! This is why we're here.

08:47.918 --> 08:48.959
Cheers.

08:48.959 --> 08:50.584
What a team, what a team.

08:50.584 --> 08:51.918
I need a shower.

08:51.918 --> 08:54.083
Yeah, you do.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.083
Head in the master's
almost done.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.167
She's done with the bed.

08:56.167 --> 09:00.542
Okay. We'll finish it tomorrow.

09:00.542 --> 09:03.709
All right, what do you mean?

09:03.709 --> 09:04.959
Let's go all the way up,

09:04.959 --> 09:06.918
so then I can have a cigarette,
'cause this is stressful stuff.

09:06.918 --> 09:08.417
It's not stressful.

09:08.417 --> 09:09.626
Yeah, because I see
how the attitude's changed

09:09.626 --> 09:10.584
towards me, but...

09:10.584 --> 09:12.417
It hasn't changed
towards you at all.

09:12.417 --> 09:14.459
-Yeah.
-I don't think it has.

09:14.459 --> 09:16.417
Okay. I do.

09:16.417 --> 09:17.459
I just wanted to
have the conversation

09:17.459 --> 09:19.000
to see how you feel about it.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.542
About what?

09:20.542 --> 09:23.167
About us, because I don't think
there is an "us."

09:23.167 --> 09:24.834
Oh [bleep] me.

09:24.834 --> 09:27.459
I mean, we all know that you
like to flirt with everybody.

09:27.459 --> 09:30.375
So, like, the thing with
this comes down to, like,

09:30.375 --> 09:32.501
more of, like, a respect thing.

09:32.501 --> 09:33.876
How could you say that when...

09:33.876 --> 09:35.334
No... oh sh--...

09:35.334 --> 09:36.542
...you kissed me, and you go
and [bleep] someone

09:36.542 --> 09:37.584
20 minutes after?

09:37.584 --> 09:41.876
-What are you talking about.
-I'm not... ugh.

09:41.876 --> 09:47.584
Yes, queens!

09:47.584 --> 09:49.167
Think about that.

09:49.167 --> 09:50.542
You're saying it's about
out of a respect thing.

09:50.542 --> 09:51.959
No, I understand...
Gary, I understand.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.250
I haven't said anything
about that.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.167
I haven't said
anything about that.

09:56.167 --> 09:57.792
[bleep] dude.

09:57.792 --> 09:59.459
What am I supposed to say?

09:59.459 --> 10:02.417
If I was to be, like, you're
a piece of sh-- to his face,

10:02.417 --> 10:04.876
he's gonna get defensive and
try to, like, spin it back.

10:04.876 --> 10:08.000
He's never in the wrong, he's
never gonna own up to anything,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.667
because Gary does
not give a [bleep]

10:09.667 --> 10:10.876
about anybody but himself.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.292
I literally don't care.

10:12.292 --> 10:14.292
You guys can do whatever.

10:14.292 --> 10:16.167
We could have done without
this whole conversation,

10:16.167 --> 10:18.375
because I'm, like,
already, like, over it.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.959
----ing hell.

10:20.959 --> 10:32.250
I'm good, everything's fine.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.501
That was a massive fail.

10:33.501 --> 10:35.792
[bleep]

10:35.792 --> 10:39.834
What's wrong?

10:39.834 --> 10:41.709
-Gary.
-Why, what did he say?

10:41.709 --> 10:44.667
He's just, like, "Your attitude
has changed towards me."

10:44.667 --> 10:47.792
"I don't want you to be,
like, mad at me,

10:47.792 --> 10:49.083
I want us to be friends."

10:49.083 --> 10:50.042
This is the definition
of a [bleep] boy.

10:50.042 --> 10:51.501
Yeah, yeah, I know.

10:51.501 --> 10:52.959
It's the most predictable
behavior.

10:52.959 --> 10:54.417
Yeah, and I...
I'm over it.

10:54.417 --> 10:55.959
I wanna have enough respect
for myself to not get

10:55.959 --> 10:57.709
----ing wound up about
this bullsh--.

10:57.709 --> 10:59.584
Exactly.

10:59.584 --> 11:03.125
It's ----ing...
it's just hilarious to me.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.792
First of all,
I am ----ing special.

11:05.792 --> 11:12.626
Honestly, shut up.
Grow up and speak to me.

11:12.626 --> 11:19.125
I'm just so... I'm just so...
I'm just so...

11:19.125 --> 11:24.667
I'm so sorry, that's
about all it is.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.709
-Talk to her?
-Yeah.

11:26.709 --> 11:31.167
-She took it good?
-Well, it was weird.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.751
Yeah, if she didn't get
the picture

11:32.751 --> 11:34.459
that I'm not into her
after that conversation,

11:34.459 --> 11:35.959
then I don't know what
I need to say.

11:35.959 --> 11:37.209
-Okay.
-I said to her,

11:37.209 --> 11:39.250
"I don't like you."

11:39.250 --> 11:40.459
No, I didn't.

11:40.459 --> 11:44.959
[laughing]

11:44.959 --> 11:48.626
-Are we all good?
-Yeah, we're fine.

11:48.626 --> 11:50.250
Okay, I don't want to...

11:50.250 --> 11:52.417
No, I'm, like...
honestly, I'm over it.

11:52.417 --> 12:01.417
-Like, I don't...
-Okay, good.

12:01.417 --> 12:06.167
[whistles]

12:06.167 --> 12:08.042
-Good?
-Good.

12:08.042 --> 12:10.918
Who are you? Hello!

12:10.918 --> 12:13.250
Let's do this.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.834
Girls and guys,
is that what's going on?

12:15.834 --> 12:17.292
Sounds lovely.

12:17.292 --> 12:19.876
Yeah, baby ----ing the boys!

12:19.876 --> 12:22.167
-Yeah!
-Woohoo!

12:22.167 --> 12:24.709
Scarlett, you've been on
the boat a charter now.

12:24.709 --> 12:27.751
All the boys on board
[bleep] marry, kill... go.

12:27.751 --> 12:30.000
Kill Gary.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.334
[bleep] Gary, marry Colin, but,
oh, I couldn't kill any of them.

12:34.334 --> 12:38.083
I would [bleep] Gary...
not now.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.751
By us staying separate
to the girls.

12:39.751 --> 12:41.792
-Kill Gary...
-Sheesh.

12:41.792 --> 12:45.959
...[bleep] Marcos, marry Colin.

12:45.959 --> 12:50.751
Ah, you!

12:50.751 --> 12:52.667
-Pulau. Pulau.
-Pulau.

12:52.667 --> 12:53.751
Let me out.

12:53.751 --> 12:56.209
Okay, gentlemen. Vamanos.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.792
This place is really cute.

12:57.792 --> 12:59.959
-Yeah.
-It is. It is.

12:59.959 --> 13:03.000
Thank you.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.250
Good evening, guys.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.751
What's your go-to drink?

13:07.751 --> 13:09.626
I want an espresso martini.

13:09.626 --> 13:10.876
Can I get you guys
some champagne?

13:10.876 --> 13:12.501
Oh, we'd like that, yeah.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.501
Should we actually just move
our table a little bit aside?

13:14.501 --> 13:15.834
Scarlett, pick up that side,
let's just move across.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.459
No, I'm not down for this.

13:17.459 --> 13:18.834
Okay, no, but just...
there's, like, a two-inch gap.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.292
What, I'm gonna get candles
and everything,

13:20.292 --> 13:22.375
it's gonna be very romantic.

13:22.375 --> 13:23.876
Gary...

13:23.876 --> 13:24.876
What do you mean?

13:24.876 --> 13:26.334
Earlier today was a lot.

13:26.334 --> 13:30.167
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:30.167 --> 13:31.292
Oh, was it?

13:31.292 --> 13:32.959
Yeah, it kinda sucked.

13:32.959 --> 13:34.167
-Why?
-Just weird.

13:34.167 --> 13:35.792
Okay. Sorry.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.792
I didn't mean anything
to affect you in any way.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.167
It's all good.

13:39.167 --> 13:40.918
I have no idea what's
happening right now,

13:40.918 --> 13:43.751
but if I was to guess,
I think Gary's like,

13:43.751 --> 13:45.792
"I'm falling in love,"
and then Scarlett's like,

13:45.792 --> 13:49.584
"I'm into you too, but what
about mean old Ashley?"

13:49.584 --> 13:50.792
I love it.

13:50.792 --> 13:51.918
Ready to order for the food?

13:51.918 --> 13:53.292
Yeah, I think so.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.584
-Pork belly.
-Salmon.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.042
Can I get the salmon
and the aubergine?

13:58.042 --> 14:02.709
Thank you very much.

14:02.709 --> 14:10.918
The one goal that I have.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.375
I know.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.751
I don't wanna see my mate
----ing have a meltdown.

14:14.751 --> 14:16.375
I know my limits.

14:16.375 --> 14:18.792
Count on me or the crew
if you need some help,

14:18.792 --> 14:20.792
don't let your...

14:20.792 --> 14:24.584
...ego and pride get in the
way of asking for help,

14:24.584 --> 14:27.584
because that's what's happening.

14:27.584 --> 14:28.876
Cheers to everyone here.

14:28.876 --> 14:29.959
How's this double date going?

14:29.959 --> 14:32.167
Pretty well so far.

14:32.167 --> 14:36.751
-Yas!
-Yes, if you must.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.459
Yay, food is here.

14:39.459 --> 14:40.459
Thank you.

14:40.459 --> 14:41.542
Bon appétit.

14:41.542 --> 14:44.792
Tell me what happened
after my chat on the bow?

14:44.792 --> 14:46.375
I'd like to know.

14:46.375 --> 14:50.375
Oh, boy.

14:50.375 --> 14:51.709
Cool.

14:51.709 --> 14:56.709
This food's delicious.

14:56.709 --> 15:01.542
Excuse me from the table.
Sorry, guys.

15:01.542 --> 15:04.876
Just do you and don't let
other things bother you.

15:04.876 --> 15:08.542
Have you snogged him?

15:08.542 --> 15:09.584
What?

15:09.584 --> 15:16.876
Have you kissed him?

15:16.876 --> 15:22.167
Oh, dear.

15:22.167 --> 15:24.626
And Daisy...

15:24.626 --> 15:26.042
Something happened at
that end of the table.

15:26.042 --> 15:27.334
You guys do you.

15:27.334 --> 15:29.125
Don't ----ing bitch at me

15:29.125 --> 15:31.501
when it comes and
bites you in the ass.

15:31.501 --> 15:32.959
That's all I'm gonna say.

15:32.959 --> 15:34.792
Nothing's gonna hurt me.

15:34.792 --> 15:38.167
-I've known Gary a long time.
-I know.

15:38.167 --> 15:40.250
When I talk about Gary,
it's through love,

15:40.250 --> 15:44.375
but it's also through a
lot of emotional trauma.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.501
This is just fun
and entertaining.

15:46.501 --> 15:48.334
Like, I...
nothing is happening.

15:48.334 --> 15:51.584
"Fun and entertaining" can
take you so far.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.334
But you have to be aware
of your surroundings.

15:53.334 --> 15:55.751
So, what, I can't be
friendly with someone?

15:55.751 --> 15:56.959
You know, it's, like...

15:56.959 --> 16:00.876
It's not gonna hurt me,
I don't give a flying [bleep].

16:00.876 --> 16:02.167
I'm not doing anything wrong.

16:02.167 --> 16:04.125
Scarlett, let's cut
the bullsh--.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.167
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, excuse me.

16:06.167 --> 16:07.209
I can be friends with whoever.

16:07.209 --> 16:08.751
Yeah, we have fun hanging out,

16:08.751 --> 16:11.709
and I can hang out
have fun, and that's okay.

16:11.709 --> 16:14.167
Scarlett, I'm not telling you
what you can and can't do.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.876
I don't have to say
anything else.

16:15.876 --> 16:17.792
Sorry, like...

16:17.792 --> 16:19.167
-You don't have to be sorry.
-...you know? Exactly.

16:19.167 --> 16:20.334
What else do you want, like...

16:20.334 --> 16:21.667
Are you okay, Scarlett?

16:21.667 --> 16:23.792
-No, I'm really ----ing annoyed.
-Why?

16:23.792 --> 16:23.792
Obvious reasons, Daisy.

16:23.792 --> 16:32.417
That was a massive fail.

16:32.417 --> 16:33.792
I'm really ----ing annoyed.

16:33.792 --> 16:34.667
Why?

16:34.667 --> 16:36.250
I'm done talking
about it, regardless.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.959
I'm gonna get a cigarette.

16:37.959 --> 16:44.626
I want to leave.

16:44.626 --> 16:45.709
Daisy is my boss,

16:45.709 --> 16:50.584
and I respect everything
that, you know, she says.

16:50.584 --> 16:52.417
We're going for a cigarette.

16:52.417 --> 16:55.626
Here, Scarlett,
Scarlett, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:55.626 --> 16:59.125
It's like, I don't know
if it's for Ashley's sake

16:59.125 --> 17:00.834
or if it's for her own sake,

17:00.834 --> 17:04.209
but I'm sorry, you can't
control, like, my love life.

17:04.209 --> 17:06.459
Don't be crying,
don't be crying.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.626
No...

17:08.626 --> 17:09.959
No, she doesn't.

17:09.959 --> 17:10.959
So, like, why... but still...

17:10.959 --> 17:12.459
In her...

17:12.459 --> 17:13.626
...come in here and focus
on your ----ing job, then.

17:13.626 --> 17:14.834
Yeah.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.000
Scarlett, you know
I'm taking the piss.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.584
I am only joking.

17:17.584 --> 17:19.375
So, I shouldn't have
done that, and I apologize.

17:19.375 --> 17:20.751
-The last thing...
-It's just, like...

17:20.751 --> 17:22.083
-...that I want to do...
-...I wouldn't...

17:22.083 --> 17:23.667
...is upset you,
or see you upset.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.667
Good evening, everybody.

17:25.667 --> 17:27.959
Where is all the girls
down that end of the table?

17:27.959 --> 17:32.584
They're having a chat.

17:32.584 --> 17:34.792
I couldn't help but
think you caused the tears.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.083
Hm.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.918
That sucked.

17:37.918 --> 17:40.042
I'm on your side. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

17:40.042 --> 17:41.626
How do you cause so much drama?

17:41.626 --> 17:43.959
I've never seen
anything like it.

17:43.959 --> 17:46.751
I want my girls
to love each other

17:46.751 --> 17:48.459
and care about each
other and be a team.

17:48.459 --> 17:49.584
Totally.

17:49.584 --> 17:51.250
I told you, like,
I've asked her, I've asked her,

17:51.250 --> 17:52.959
and you're like,
"Come on, really?"

17:52.959 --> 17:55.542
Maybe she should be more honest
if somebody's hurting her...

17:55.542 --> 17:58.417
-And you're right.
-...because then I wouldn't.

17:58.417 --> 18:00.626
She's... okay, between me and
you, she's full of sh--, okay?

18:00.626 --> 18:04.375
I'm gonna laugh and giggle
and smile the entire night.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.459
I caused this bridge.

18:06.459 --> 18:08.792
No, and I appreciate, like,
you talking to me, I really do.

18:08.792 --> 18:11.959
I just need a moment,
and then I'll be good.

18:11.959 --> 18:14.626
-Do you want a shot?
-No.

18:14.626 --> 18:15.751
Daisy?

18:15.751 --> 18:17.626
I was just wondering if
you wanted your things back.

18:17.626 --> 18:20.125
[Daisy laughs]

18:20.125 --> 18:22.334
Can I help you?

18:22.334 --> 18:23.876
I would love to know.

18:23.876 --> 18:26.167
Oh, my God, I feel awful.

18:26.167 --> 18:28.209
-Don't blame yourself.
-No, it was me.

18:28.209 --> 18:29.209
-Never...
-I said stuff that I shouldn't.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.542
Never blame yourself.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.542
-Well, who should I blame?
-Blame Gary.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.584
[laughing]

18:34.584 --> 18:36.584
You can't make Scarlett
and Ashley

18:36.584 --> 18:38.375
happy at the same time,
just remember that.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.209
You've said what's real,
and that's great.

18:40.209 --> 18:41.792
People should
thank you for that.

18:41.792 --> 18:43.250
Thanks.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.000
-Come on, chill out.
-Thanks for that.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.042
Stop putting yourself down,
because that's rubbish.

18:48.042 --> 18:49.584
Right now, I feel really bad.

18:49.584 --> 18:51.375
The ironic thing is
I was trying to help Scarlett

18:51.375 --> 18:53.542
not make a bad decision,

18:53.542 --> 18:55.000
but Scarlett,
you do what you want.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.792
I am done.

18:56.792 --> 18:58.334
-Naughty.
-Thank you for consoling me.

18:58.334 --> 19:00.751
Just ----ing worry about
yourself

19:00.751 --> 19:02.250
for one bloody
minute, will you?

19:02.250 --> 19:03.417
-Thank you.
-Hi!

19:03.417 --> 19:04.876
Let's go and get drunk.

19:04.876 --> 19:07.167
Vamanos, guys,
take the beers, take the beers.

19:07.167 --> 19:08.918
I'll get in the
back with Kelsie.

19:08.918 --> 19:10.292
I've just gotta climb...

19:10.292 --> 19:12.459
It's okay, I saw
the whole thing.

19:12.459 --> 19:14.083
-Oh, yeah?
-Ashley!

19:14.083 --> 19:18.792
Behave yourself.

19:18.792 --> 19:23.709
Yeah, and now he's just
asking for a simple kiss.

19:23.709 --> 19:25.959
Oh!

19:25.959 --> 19:27.959
Kelsie! Sh--.

19:27.959 --> 19:32.501
-Are you kidding me?
-Oh, Kelsie!

19:32.501 --> 19:34.959
-Oh!
-Oh, goodness' sake.

19:34.959 --> 19:43.792
[laughing]

19:43.792 --> 19:45.417
I've not got a condom...

19:45.417 --> 19:47.876
No, kiss her nicely.

19:47.876 --> 19:49.626
Sh--.

19:49.626 --> 19:52.125
No, that's as much
a kiss you're getting.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.417
I really loved it.

19:53.417 --> 19:55.959
Whatever, you're boring as
[bleep].

19:55.959 --> 19:58.167
Whoopsie, I made a tootsie!

19:58.167 --> 20:00.250
Get out!
Oh, my God!

20:00.250 --> 20:04.167
[shouting]

20:04.167 --> 20:06.667
[laughing]

20:06.667 --> 20:08.542
Ai, arriba!

20:08.542 --> 20:10.167
I wanna put my sweatshirt on.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.959
Hey!
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

20:12.959 --> 20:14.375
I love you.
Thank you.

20:14.375 --> 20:21.375
It's been rough, but,
we're good.

20:21.375 --> 20:24.083
I want you to put some pants on
and let's go outside.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.876
[bleep]

20:25.876 --> 20:28.167
Oh, she's the boss woman.

20:28.167 --> 20:32.417
-I know, I like that.
-I see that, I like that.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.042
I was having a lovely sleep.

20:34.042 --> 20:35.667
Ooh, someone's got some rhythm.

20:35.667 --> 20:40.042
Wow, not only a pretty face,
but can dance, too.

20:40.042 --> 20:42.626
Barnaby, are you ready?
Ah! Woohoo!

20:42.626 --> 20:45.959
Oh. That was great.

20:45.959 --> 20:50.042
[chattering]

20:50.042 --> 20:53.459
-Barnaby, come on!
-I need another beer.

20:53.459 --> 20:55.709
Let's go and get a drink.
Let's get a drink.

20:55.709 --> 20:56.792
Woop, woop.

20:56.792 --> 20:58.042
You like?

20:58.042 --> 21:02.250
-Woop, woop, woop.
-Woo! Yeah, my boy!

21:02.250 --> 21:07.792
She's at the bar.

21:07.792 --> 21:10.667
Oh, shut up whining, God, Gary.

21:10.667 --> 21:14.959
Mm, say that again... say
that "God, Gary" one more...

21:14.959 --> 21:17.334
Okay.

21:17.334 --> 21:19.584
-He's stopped.
-[bleep]

21:19.584 --> 21:21.751
Hola, mis amigos!

21:21.751 --> 21:23.542
Hola, amiga.

21:23.542 --> 21:24.459
Como estas?

21:24.459 --> 21:28.751
Daisy, you are so pretty,
like a flower.

21:28.751 --> 21:30.209
I disagree.

21:30.209 --> 21:32.792
Oh [bleep] off.

21:32.792 --> 21:38.000
[shouting]

21:38.000 --> 21:40.834
I'm gonna go find Daisy.

21:40.834 --> 21:42.209
Barnaby, we're gonna hang.

21:42.209 --> 21:44.459
Daisy, you wanna
do a body shot?

21:44.459 --> 21:47.209
No.

21:47.209 --> 21:48.792
No. Oh, that is...

21:48.792 --> 21:52.250
Oh... how bad does
this feel, how bad? Oh my God.

21:52.250 --> 21:57.626
Sleep, bro.

21:57.626 --> 22:00.250
Annoyed?

22:00.250 --> 22:06.083
No, you gotta...

22:06.083 --> 22:09.584
I think you were saying,
like, read between the lines,

22:09.584 --> 22:17.834
but she was like, but
I'm not doing anything wrong.

22:17.834 --> 22:25.501
And that's friendship on board.

22:25.501 --> 22:35.375
It's not something
I would do personally.

22:35.375 --> 22:37.375
Mm-hmm, it will be.

22:37.375 --> 22:41.209
But at least no one's hurt.

22:41.209 --> 22:46.083
For the moment.

22:46.083 --> 22:46.083
[giggles]

22:46.083 --> 22:50.417
I'm really ----ing annoyed.

22:50.417 --> 22:52.042
Are you in bed?

22:52.042 --> 22:56.959
Night-night.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.501
I'm good.

22:58.501 --> 23:00.584
I'm good, I'm good,
I'm good, but thank you.

23:00.584 --> 23:01.959
Cool, thank you.

23:01.959 --> 23:04.209
Oh, my gosh, he is charming,

23:04.209 --> 23:06.459
and this and that,
but it doesn't mean

23:06.459 --> 23:07.459
I'm gonna sleep
with him tonight.

23:07.459 --> 23:09.209
I just have respect for myself.

23:09.209 --> 23:13.751
I know what I've heard, so
watch me avoid this situation.

23:13.751 --> 23:14.792
I'm out.

23:14.792 --> 23:15.792
I'm out.

23:15.792 --> 23:16.792
Really?

23:16.792 --> 23:18.751
Yeah, it's late, I'm tired.

23:18.751 --> 23:19.959
Good night.

23:19.959 --> 23:21.250
See you in the morning.

23:21.250 --> 23:32.042
Nothing... nothing to see,
nothing to do.

23:32.042 --> 23:33.292
Ow!

23:33.292 --> 23:35.959
Are you hangover?

23:35.959 --> 23:38.584
[laughing]

23:38.584 --> 23:41.584
Good morning.

23:41.584 --> 23:42.167
Morning.

23:42.167 --> 23:43.918
Good morning, how are you?

23:43.918 --> 23:46.459
Slightly drunk.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.959
Obviously, the aim is
to get the cabins done.

23:48.959 --> 23:50.792
Sounds good.

23:50.792 --> 23:52.167
-Yeah.
-Morning.

23:52.167 --> 23:53.167
I'm gonna go get started.

23:53.167 --> 23:54.834
What a ----ing night.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.334
Wait, would you like me
to blade these?

23:56.334 --> 23:58.834
Well, I'm gonna rinse first.

23:58.834 --> 24:03.751
I am in a great mood.

24:03.751 --> 24:07.959
The sooner we get it done,
the sooner we're done.

24:07.959 --> 24:09.334
Ah.

24:09.334 --> 24:11.792
I had a dream that one day,

24:11.792 --> 24:14.209
I could have a
shirt that would fit me.

24:14.209 --> 24:16.626
-Look at this thing.
-Oh. Okay.

24:16.626 --> 24:19.375
Yo... so, look
at this sh--.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.959
That's strong wind, 30 knots.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.042
-Look at that.
-Yeah.

24:22.042 --> 24:23.459
Three-meter seas.

24:23.459 --> 24:26.125
Our option would be go up
here to Fornells,

24:26.125 --> 24:29.000
so that when the wind comes
we're fully protected in there,

24:29.000 --> 24:30.959
and the guests will join,
we'll pick them up at anchor,

24:30.959 --> 24:32.459
like we've done in the past.

24:32.459 --> 24:34.167
We'll stay at anchor
for four or five days.

24:34.167 --> 24:35.542
Okay.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.167
It's not gonna be
a very fun charter,

24:37.167 --> 24:38.584
just sitting on a dock.

24:38.584 --> 24:41.167
When the wind comes,
it can be quite nasty.

24:41.167 --> 24:43.542
Our best option is to be
in protected water,

24:43.542 --> 24:46.542
where we can get the water toys
out and we can still have fun.

24:46.542 --> 24:48.876
It's always something on boats.

24:48.876 --> 24:50.417
I'd like to go sooner
rather than later.

24:50.417 --> 24:51.959
Yeah, because if it's gonna
blow like that,

24:51.959 --> 24:53.834
I'm sure other people are
gonna try that also.

24:53.834 --> 24:55.083
I think there's already
people already up there.

24:55.083 --> 24:56.417
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:56.417 --> 24:58.000
All crew, all crew,
we're gonna move

24:58.000 --> 25:01.167
the boat up north because
there's a big storm coming.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.876
Get ready to leave as
soon as possible.

25:02.876 --> 25:03.959
Copy.

25:03.959 --> 25:05.334
It's easier to handle over here.

25:05.334 --> 25:06.626
You guys can start
dropping lines.

25:06.626 --> 25:07.959
Yeah.

25:07.959 --> 25:09.959
Okay, shall we?

25:09.959 --> 25:12.042
All lines clear.

25:12.042 --> 25:14.584
Okay, let's get that
tender on tow, please.

25:14.584 --> 25:15.792
Copy.

25:15.792 --> 25:17.542
So, why don't you
grab the stern line.

25:17.542 --> 25:22.542
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

25:22.542 --> 25:24.959
Copy, thank you very much.

25:24.959 --> 25:26.250
-Colin.
-How was your night?

25:26.250 --> 25:29.459
Interesting.

25:29.459 --> 25:33.501
Yes. I'm over it.

25:33.501 --> 25:34.876
Huh.

25:34.876 --> 25:36.459
Is there any other sense?

25:36.459 --> 25:37.792
-No.
-Jealousy?

25:37.792 --> 25:43.667
No.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.167
You are so full of sh--
right now.

25:46.167 --> 25:47.834
Okay, Daisy, okay.

25:47.834 --> 25:50.250
Now you can't make out,
because the new girl's here.

25:50.250 --> 25:53.042
You honestly think that if
I came on to Gary

25:53.042 --> 25:54.626
he would be, like, no, no, no?

25:54.626 --> 25:56.501
Yeah.

25:56.501 --> 25:59.334
Oh, God!

25:59.334 --> 26:03.375
Colin, you're as naïve as I am.

26:03.375 --> 26:04.876
-Does this one move?
-Yes.

26:04.876 --> 26:16.209
So, what's done
and what's not done?

26:16.209 --> 26:17.417
No, kiss her nicely.

26:17.417 --> 26:18.959
Young deckhands
have a thing for me.

26:18.959 --> 26:20.083
[laughing]

26:20.083 --> 26:22.334
That's their problem.

26:22.334 --> 26:24.876
Ah, you guys were kissing quite
passionately in the car.

26:24.876 --> 26:27.125
No, it wasn't,
it was like this.

26:27.125 --> 26:28.417
Ooh, I liked that.

26:28.417 --> 26:30.125
Yeah, I kiss anyone.

26:30.125 --> 26:32.292
-My face has just got...
-Oh, [bleep] off.

26:32.292 --> 26:33.292
Swear to God.

26:33.292 --> 26:38.792
[laughing]

26:38.792 --> 26:39.959
Oof, busy.

26:39.959 --> 26:42.125
You wouldn't wanna try and
get outta here in a hurry.

26:42.125 --> 26:43.626
Big boat, coming through.

26:43.626 --> 26:47.501
Okay, let it go,
let it go, let it go.

26:47.501 --> 26:49.584
Do you want me to finish
downstairs, or I don't know?

26:49.584 --> 26:51.876
We'll get up early tomorrow,
it's fine.

26:51.876 --> 26:53.709
That's two shots.

26:53.709 --> 26:54.459
Done, thank you.

26:54.459 --> 26:56.584
Gary, Daisy, Marcos,

26:56.584 --> 27:00.584
meet me in the crew mess for
a preference sheet meeting.

27:00.584 --> 27:02.667
Can I squeeze in here?

27:02.667 --> 27:04.209
What's this,
charter number ocho.

27:04.209 --> 27:06.417
-Eight. Ocho.
-The penultimate.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.792
Lane Merrifield runs his
own start-up company,

27:08.792 --> 27:11.417
which operates between
Orange County, California,

27:11.417 --> 27:13.125
and Alberta, Canada.

27:13.125 --> 27:14.959
-Oh.
-Yeah, baby.

27:14.959 --> 27:16.542
Canadians, my countrymen.

27:16.542 --> 27:19.542
Joining Lane is
his fiancé, Amanda.

27:19.542 --> 27:22.167
Lane proposed just
before arriving to Menorca,

27:22.167 --> 27:23.792
and they cannot wait
to celebrate

27:23.792 --> 27:24.959
their engagement
with their friends.

27:24.959 --> 27:26.667
That's cool.

27:26.667 --> 27:28.751
Oh, he's been in 30 different
Michelin stars restaurant.

27:28.751 --> 27:30.959
He actually like Japanese,
seafood,

27:30.959 --> 27:32.459
and molecular gastronomy.

27:32.459 --> 27:34.292
Can you enlighten me?

27:34.292 --> 27:39.959
That type of cuisine...

27:39.959 --> 27:41.626
Okay.

27:41.626 --> 27:44.125
But it's gonna be actually
the pure flavor of red pepper.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.584
-It's ----ing cool.
-Cool.

27:45.584 --> 28:05.667
Yeah.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.417
It's a big challenge
right here for me.

28:07.417 --> 28:09.792
On night one, the guests
would like to celebrate

28:09.792 --> 28:12.417
Lane and Amanda's engagement
with a white party,

28:12.417 --> 28:14.876
accompanied by a seafood-focused
dinner spread.

28:14.876 --> 28:16.959
On day two, the guests
would like to compete against

28:16.959 --> 28:19.792
the yacht crew in a who's
the beat seaman relay race.

28:19.792 --> 28:21.959
Hm, that's gonna be interesting,

28:21.959 --> 28:24.209
because this weather's
that's coming in

28:24.209 --> 28:26.834
is gonna make tomorrow
very, very lumpy.

28:26.834 --> 28:29.000
We'll have to have the guests
join us on anchor

28:29.000 --> 28:30.501
instead of from the dock.

28:30.501 --> 28:32.375
-Okay.
-All right, thank you very much.

28:32.375 --> 28:34.000
Awesome, thanks, Glenn.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.292
Oh.

28:38.292 --> 28:43.375
Go and sleep.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.959
All right, I'm going to bed.

28:44.959 --> 28:49.417
So tired.

28:49.417 --> 28:50.792
You're drawing your food now.

28:50.792 --> 28:54.042
I have to write a menu,
molecular gastronomy.

28:54.042 --> 28:56.042
That's cool,
I didn't know that was a thing.

28:56.042 --> 28:57.167
Yeah.

28:57.167 --> 28:58.667
That's what the best do.

28:58.667 --> 29:00.000
Well, I don't know, but...

29:00.000 --> 29:02.167
All right, I'll keep
drawing this sh--.

29:02.167 --> 29:03.542
Night-night.

29:03.542 --> 29:06.626
I was 28 when I learned
molecular food

29:06.626 --> 29:10.000
under two chefs that each
one have two Michelin stars.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.250
I am a little bit nervous about
it, because for molecular food,

29:14.250 --> 29:16.584
you have to be very
precise and practice.

29:16.584 --> 29:18.626
Otherwise, it's
gonna be sh--.

29:18.626 --> 29:21.292
I'm gonna be in my bed
----ing getting something.

29:21.292 --> 29:26.959
The pressure is on me,
100 percent.

29:26.959 --> 29:29.667
Ai-yi-yi.

29:29.667 --> 29:30.375
Coming up.

29:30.375 --> 29:32.334
I fell face-first out of my bed.

29:32.334 --> 29:35.042
I was sh---faced, so...

29:35.042 --> 29:36.334
Ashley.

29:36.334 --> 29:36.334
Am I in trouble again?

29:36.334 --> 29:47.542
Are you in bed?

29:47.542 --> 29:50.375
[yawns]

29:50.375 --> 29:53.292
It's no good to start
the charter this tired.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.834
One more week, one more week.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.125
Morning, morning, morning.

29:56.125 --> 29:58.959
So, Scarlett, you're gonna go
up and start in the main saloon.

29:58.959 --> 29:59.959
Uh-huh.

29:59.959 --> 30:01.250
Okay, cool.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.834
Clean windows, waterline,
and tender.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.167
-Covers are off.
-Yeah.

30:04.167 --> 30:05.334
-Covers are on.
-Good morning.

30:05.334 --> 30:06.584
Marcos from Parsifal III.

30:06.584 --> 30:08.167
I ordered six wheat bread,

30:08.167 --> 30:13.375
dry ice, and also heavy cream,
the one for whipping, all right?

30:13.375 --> 30:14.459
-Okay.
-All right.

30:14.459 --> 30:16.334
-Thank you.
-Okay.

30:16.334 --> 30:18.959
It's simply too windy
for a charter, I think.

30:18.959 --> 30:20.501
What else is on the list?

30:20.501 --> 30:22.918
Towels, transom door.

30:22.918 --> 30:24.751
Those stairs need to be done.

30:24.751 --> 30:25.792
Okay.

30:25.792 --> 30:27.542
You're far too close
to outside.

30:27.542 --> 30:29.167
Well, I gotta clean up
all the water

30:29.167 --> 30:31.125
that you guys dripped in here.

30:31.125 --> 30:34.417
All crew, all crew,
provisions are here.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.959
On my way. Careful!

30:35.959 --> 30:37.959
We don't wanna go too close.

30:37.959 --> 30:40.792
We'll make a chain
and bring it all in.

30:40.792 --> 30:42.375
How you doing?

30:42.375 --> 30:45.459
I can't see you.

30:45.459 --> 30:47.000
I think we're getting close to
being done.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.250
-Can you manage?
-Yeah.

30:49.250 --> 30:50.792
I'm not gonna miss this part.

30:50.792 --> 30:52.584
What's, like, our schedule
looking like today?

30:52.584 --> 30:54.459
Ashley's happy on lates,
I'm happy on earlies,

30:54.459 --> 30:56.542
and I think mids is
good for you, because...

30:56.542 --> 30:57.417
Me, too.

30:57.417 --> 30:58.667
...you get to learn
everything, and...

30:58.667 --> 30:59.834
-Me, too.
-...be with us.

30:59.834 --> 31:02.125
I think it's perfect.

31:02.125 --> 31:03.334
Oh, yeah.

31:03.334 --> 31:06.792
Much better, Glenn will
be very happy.

31:06.792 --> 31:08.834
If there's space out there,
we can put some out there, too.

31:08.834 --> 31:09.834
They just won't be cold.

31:09.834 --> 31:10.959
Okay, cool.

31:10.959 --> 31:12.959
I can approach this
whole situation with Scarlett

31:12.959 --> 31:14.292
so much differently.

31:14.292 --> 31:16.167
I could be a total bitch,

31:16.167 --> 31:18.501
but I'm trying to take the
high road and prove

31:18.501 --> 31:21.709
that at least I'm not
a piece of sh--.

31:21.709 --> 31:22.584
Out here, Ashley?

31:22.584 --> 31:24.959
Yeah, if there's
room behind the bar.

31:24.959 --> 31:26.834
-How we looking, big B?
-We're pretty much there.

31:26.834 --> 31:30.209
All crew, all crew, 20 minutes,
everybody dressed,

31:30.209 --> 31:32.375
ready to go, in the cockpit,
please.

31:32.375 --> 31:33.459
It looks great downstairs.

31:33.459 --> 31:36.083
Sweet, thanks, Dais.

31:36.083 --> 31:37.709
Are you ready for this sh--?

31:37.709 --> 31:42.959
Not really, but...

31:42.959 --> 31:44.584
Oh, groundhog day.

31:44.584 --> 31:45.959
All right, let's go
in the cockpit.

31:45.959 --> 31:48.125
Okay, okay.

31:48.125 --> 31:49.959
This is the first one we've done
where we picked up at anchor,

31:49.959 --> 31:52.959
so these guys are gonna go in,
pick up the guests.

31:52.959 --> 31:55.584
As soon as the greeting's done,
you take 'em on a tour.

31:55.584 --> 31:58.125
Two of them will go back,
grab all the luggage

31:58.125 --> 32:00.250
and bring it back to the boat,
and well do it just as normal,

32:00.250 --> 32:02.792
except it'll come on the swim
platform instead of the gangway.

32:02.792 --> 32:04.000
Cool? Let's do it.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.417
You can get in there.

32:08.417 --> 32:10.334
Just get the little quick vac.

32:10.334 --> 32:11.959
Yeah, you can pour
the champagne now.

32:11.959 --> 32:13.292
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:13.292 --> 32:14.334
-The stainless on the rams...
-Okay, cool.

32:14.334 --> 32:15.667
...and around the sides of that,

32:15.667 --> 32:17.250
give that a chamois,
that'd be great.

32:17.250 --> 32:20.167
So, Daisy, tonight I'm gonna
do the seafood spread.

32:20.167 --> 32:21.501
Mm-hmm.

32:21.501 --> 32:22.959
That's what they
request for tonight.

32:22.959 --> 32:24.584
So, tomorrow I'm gonna
do the molecular.

32:24.584 --> 32:25.751
Hey, guys.

32:25.751 --> 32:27.167
It's a little smaller
than I thought.

32:27.167 --> 32:28.834
How's... yeah, well, welcome!

32:28.834 --> 32:29.459
No, I'm joking.

32:29.459 --> 32:31.167
Here, let me help you on.

32:31.167 --> 32:32.375
Where do you put the sails,
exactly?

32:32.375 --> 32:33.792
Charter number eight!

32:33.792 --> 32:35.167
-It's gonna be interesting.
-Thank you.

32:35.167 --> 32:36.584
It's gonna be downwind, so

32:36.584 --> 32:38.292
it should be quite dry
the whole way there.

32:38.292 --> 32:40.417
The weather hasn't been
the greatest, but...

32:40.417 --> 32:46.834
-Yeah.
-...we can make the most of it.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.834
Okay, that's everybody in
the cockpit right now, please.

32:48.834 --> 32:51.834
There she is.

32:51.834 --> 32:53.334
Okay, you ready, Dais?

32:53.334 --> 32:54.876
I was born ready.

32:54.876 --> 32:56.209
Hi.

32:56.209 --> 32:58.584
We thought this was the
boat at first.

32:58.584 --> 33:00.584
Your cabins are just
down in there.

33:00.584 --> 33:01.751
-Yeah.
-You nervous?

33:01.751 --> 33:02.959
I always nervous.

33:02.959 --> 33:04.000
Thank you.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.417
Thank you, hello!

33:05.417 --> 33:06.709
Hello, welcome aboard,
I'm Captain Glenn.

33:06.709 --> 33:08.375
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi, I'm Daisy.

33:08.375 --> 33:09.876
If you want, you can just kick
your shoes off in that basket,

33:09.876 --> 33:11.792
and we'll get you up
to the cockpit.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.834
-Scarlett, nice to meet you.
-I'm Lane, nice to meet you.

33:13.834 --> 33:17.584
-Hi, I'm Ashley.
-My favorite, my favorite.

33:17.584 --> 33:18.959
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome, Marcos.

33:18.959 --> 33:20.375
Welcome aboard.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.876
We have a great trip
planned for you.

33:21.876 --> 33:25.250
Daisy is going to take you
for a little tour.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.542
Awesome, let's do it,
let's do it.

33:26.542 --> 33:27.959
-Wanna follow me?
-All right.

33:27.959 --> 33:30.542
So, up here we've got
the hot tub,

33:30.542 --> 33:32.501
and then behind you
is the bunny pad,

33:32.501 --> 33:34.292
which is a nice place
to lay out.

33:34.292 --> 33:36.334
Wow, this is spectacular.

33:36.334 --> 33:37.792
Little bigger than
the dinghy we came up in.

33:37.792 --> 33:38.918
Yeah, a little bit.

33:38.918 --> 33:41.209
Anyway, we're so cute, all
sitting here together.

33:41.209 --> 33:42.250
I love it.

33:42.250 --> 33:43.250
-Yeah, look at us.
-Aw!

33:43.250 --> 33:44.667
The three best friends.

33:44.667 --> 33:45.584
Oh, gummy bears!

33:45.584 --> 33:48.375
So, down here we've got
the main saloon.

33:48.375 --> 33:49.792
It's nice and cool down here,

33:49.792 --> 33:52.334
pre-dinner drinks,
just hang out by the bar.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.709
Then if you wanna follow
me down to the cabins.

33:54.709 --> 33:56.959
[bleep] they've got
a lot of bags, ooh.

33:56.959 --> 33:58.542
Oh, my back's killing me.

33:58.542 --> 34:00.375
This is the master cabin.

34:00.375 --> 34:01.751
This is nice, eh?

34:01.751 --> 34:04.876
-This will do.
-Yeah, this'll work, eh?

34:04.876 --> 34:06.375
And I'll grab the
two square platters

34:06.375 --> 34:09.959
from under the kitchen table.

34:09.959 --> 34:10.959
This is pretty, hey?

34:10.959 --> 34:11.959
Are we going through the master?

34:11.959 --> 34:13.584
Yeah.

34:13.584 --> 34:15.709
Let's go right now, quickly,
before someone comes down.

34:15.709 --> 34:19.792
Ka chang, wanna hand me bags.

34:19.792 --> 34:21.501
-Girls' side, boys' side?
-Yeah.

34:21.501 --> 34:22.918
-Is it the boys' side?
-All right.

34:22.918 --> 34:24.334
What time do you think
you would like lunch at?

34:24.334 --> 34:25.959
Maybe do the lunch around 2:00?

34:25.959 --> 34:27.667
Maybe do dinner, like, 8:30?

34:27.667 --> 34:29.250
-Perfect.
-Okay, great.

34:29.250 --> 34:33.792
-Awesome, thank you.
-You're welcome.

34:33.792 --> 34:38.000
Is that all of it?
Let's close that door.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.292
Is everyone here Canadian?

34:39.292 --> 34:40.375
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Yes.

34:40.375 --> 34:42.042
Myself included.

34:42.042 --> 34:43.501
So, you're saying this is gonna
be the most polite boat ever.

34:43.501 --> 34:44.709
Oh, yeah, of course.

34:44.709 --> 34:45.959
We have that reputation,
don't we?

34:45.959 --> 34:47.042
-We do.
-Yeah.

34:47.042 --> 34:48.834
Anyhow, the weather right now,

34:48.834 --> 34:50.876
I don't know if you guys have
heard, but it's really bad,

34:50.876 --> 34:52.876
and it's only
just getting started.

34:52.876 --> 34:55.542
So, tonight and
especially tomorrow,

34:55.542 --> 34:57.959
it's gonna be quite windy,
three-meter seas.

34:57.959 --> 35:00.584
We couldn't do
anything out there.

35:00.584 --> 35:02.209
Is there gonna be any chance
to put up the sails?

35:02.209 --> 35:03.459
I don't think so.

35:03.459 --> 35:05.167
I feel really bad about that,

35:05.167 --> 35:07.375
because that's the whole point
of going on a sailing boat.

35:07.375 --> 35:11.250
We're gonna have to be really
creative to keep them occupied.

35:11.250 --> 35:12.959
But fortunately, Canadians
are notorious

35:12.959 --> 35:15.709
for being chilled-out,
easygoing people,

35:15.709 --> 35:17.792
and I'm being
completely impartial.

35:17.792 --> 35:18.959
[laughing]

35:18.959 --> 35:21.000
You know, you guys'll still
be able to lounge, swim,

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
all the dining and everything.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.209
Perfect.

35:23.209 --> 35:24.292
So, I'm gonna let
you guys relax,

35:24.292 --> 35:25.417
and welcome aboard, and...

35:25.417 --> 35:26.959
-Thank you!
-Have fun.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.417
Well, it's a bummer
we can't sail, but...

35:28.417 --> 35:29.959
-Mm, mm-hmm.
-...we'll figure it out.

35:29.959 --> 35:30.959
Yeah.

35:30.959 --> 35:32.667
The lunch is gonna be half-two,

35:32.667 --> 35:35.542
so if we set up at half-one,
it's gonna be buffet style.

35:35.542 --> 35:38.250
And Scarlett, will you turn
over the laundry, please?

35:38.250 --> 35:39.626
Thank you.

35:39.626 --> 35:40.667
Hey, let's get bathing suits on.

35:40.667 --> 35:42.042
-Okay!
-Let's do it.

35:42.042 --> 35:46.584
Let's get our rooms, let's go.

35:46.584 --> 35:47.876
Are your nerves going,
or are you still good?

35:47.876 --> 35:49.334
I always nervous.

35:49.334 --> 35:50.834
Until the first meal,
and then it's okay?

35:50.834 --> 35:51.501
Yeah.

35:51.501 --> 35:52.959
And then it's fine, right?

35:52.959 --> 35:54.584
And then it's fine.

35:54.584 --> 35:56.751
Can I get any of you a fresh
drink or something different?

35:56.751 --> 35:58.626
-I'll do an Aperol spritz.
-Aperol spritz?

35:58.626 --> 35:59.959
-Yeah, I'll do the same, please.
-Yeah?

35:59.959 --> 36:01.167
-Thank you.
-Make it three, not very sweet.

36:01.167 --> 36:02.375
Okay.

36:02.375 --> 36:03.709
Hey, they seem super-chilled.

36:03.709 --> 36:04.542
Are you okay?

36:04.542 --> 36:06.125
I'm just thinking.

36:06.125 --> 36:07.959
Well, I guess this is our
home for the next few days.

36:07.959 --> 36:09.000
It's not a bad view.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.876
It is crazy that they...

36:10.876 --> 36:13.000
like, it's windy, and you can't
sail because it's too windy.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.834
This wind! Here you go.

36:14.834 --> 36:16.083
Oh, lovely, thank you.

36:16.083 --> 36:18.375
-I'll trade you.
-Thanks very much.

36:18.375 --> 36:20.417
It is getting a little windy.

36:20.417 --> 36:22.083
Very interesting
charter set here.

36:22.083 --> 36:24.083
Maybe we set up the rope swing.

36:24.083 --> 36:25.751
I think they wanna have a go,

36:25.751 --> 36:27.250
because they're disappointed
we're not sailing.

36:27.250 --> 36:28.375
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

36:28.375 --> 36:29.417
Everyone else is
good right now?

36:29.417 --> 36:30.459
We are good. Yeah.

36:30.459 --> 36:31.918
Magic, thank you.

36:31.918 --> 36:33.834
-Who is that one, Ashley?
-Ashley, yeah. Yes.

36:33.834 --> 36:35.959
Every Ashley I've met
has been Smashley.

36:35.959 --> 36:37.167
I don't know why.

36:37.167 --> 36:38.501
No, I bet you
she can let loose.

36:38.501 --> 36:39.959
All good?
Are they on the bow?

36:39.959 --> 36:41.375
Yeah.

36:41.375 --> 36:42.959
One of you guys better
come dry for me, please.

36:42.959 --> 36:43.959
Yeah.

36:43.959 --> 36:45.083
You want me to seat them?

36:45.083 --> 36:49.459
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Okay.

36:49.459 --> 36:53.959
Whenever you're ready,
if you wanna take a seat.

36:53.959 --> 36:55.792
Is this too unbuttoned?

36:55.792 --> 37:01.125
-Should I put on a shirt?
-No.

37:01.125 --> 37:02.459
Oh, burrata.

37:02.459 --> 37:04.125
Oh, that's the stuff,
right there.

37:04.125 --> 37:05.959
Yep, speaking our language here.

37:05.959 --> 37:07.709
That looks fantastic.

37:07.709 --> 37:10.334
-It's a bowl of alcohol.
-Yeah, it's a goblet.

37:10.334 --> 37:13.125
Ah, there he is. Yay!

37:13.125 --> 37:16.292
We have a rib-eye with some
crispy grilled vegetables.

37:16.292 --> 37:18.959
Then we have a red snapper,
grilled chicken,

37:18.959 --> 37:21.792
and Caprese salad
with burrata cheese.

37:21.792 --> 37:23.834
I wasn't paying attention,
what was it again?

37:23.834 --> 37:26.584
-All right, guys.
-Thank you so much.

37:26.584 --> 37:28.375
Ashley and Daisy
are family now,

37:28.375 --> 37:30.751
so they are helping
us with the meal.

37:30.751 --> 37:31.792
Okay.

37:31.792 --> 37:37.459
I'll just have one scoopful,
please, thank you.

37:37.459 --> 37:39.751
Smashley? I've heard
that one before.

37:39.751 --> 37:41.667
How did I get that
nickname already?

37:41.667 --> 37:43.501
We don't even really know you,
but it's like...

37:43.501 --> 37:44.918
Oh, God.

37:44.918 --> 37:46.584
I fell face-first out of my bed.

37:46.584 --> 37:48.959
I was sh---faced, so, like...

37:48.959 --> 37:53.042
You don't need to tell me twice.

37:53.042 --> 37:54.959
Ashley.

37:54.959 --> 37:54.959
Am I in trouble again?

37:54.959 --> 38:00.834
[yawns]

38:00.834 --> 38:02.584
I fell face-first out of my bed.

38:02.584 --> 38:05.083
I was sh---faced, so...

38:05.083 --> 38:06.083
Ashley.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.501
Am I in trouble again?

38:07.501 --> 38:09.918
With these guests,
they wanna walk away

38:09.918 --> 38:11.250
feeling like they've made
a friend,

38:11.250 --> 38:12.667
but they also wanna
walk away

38:12.667 --> 38:14.626
like they've had
five-star service.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.667
Finding that balance
of being their friend

38:16.667 --> 38:18.417
but also being professional...

38:18.417 --> 38:19.876
I've been told that in my time.

38:19.876 --> 38:21.167
I need to work on it.

38:21.167 --> 38:22.501
I'm gonna go on a break.

38:22.501 --> 38:25.542
I need to trust that you
are being professional.

38:25.542 --> 38:28.000
-Yeah, you got this?
-Yes, Daisy.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.334
Great, girls, thank you.

38:29.334 --> 38:30.792
Hey, Kels, if you wanna go down,

38:30.792 --> 38:32.542
you can go down now, and
then can you be up at 10:00?

38:32.542 --> 38:33.542
Cool, cool, cool.

38:33.542 --> 38:34.876
They're very happy.

38:34.876 --> 38:35.792
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

38:35.792 --> 38:37.417
-Is that your happy dance?
-Happy dance.

38:37.417 --> 38:39.375
That's enough food, right?

38:39.375 --> 38:41.584
Yeah, I think so.

38:41.584 --> 38:43.209
-Are we full?
-Oh, I'm so full.

38:43.209 --> 38:44.584
-Yeah?
-Need a towel.

38:44.584 --> 38:47.751
-Yeah, that was amazing.
-That was delicious.

38:47.751 --> 38:48.584
Oof.

38:48.584 --> 38:50.751
Well, let's toss on
some sunscreen.

38:50.751 --> 38:52.584
What we could do is
try the rope swing.

38:52.584 --> 38:53.792
That's what I was just
thinking, I'm like...

38:53.792 --> 38:55.042
Oh, yeah,
we're gonna rope-swing.

38:55.042 --> 39:01.042
I'm sleepy now.

39:01.042 --> 39:02.083
-Hello.
-Hello!

39:02.083 --> 39:03.083
What would you like?

39:03.083 --> 39:05.250
I'll do Modelo.

39:05.250 --> 39:06.542
Cheers. Thank you very much.

39:06.542 --> 39:07.584
You're welcome.

39:07.584 --> 39:09.125
We got enough slack?

39:09.125 --> 39:10.792
Wait, get up there first.

39:10.792 --> 39:11.792
Hold tension.

39:11.792 --> 39:12.542
Yeah?

39:12.542 --> 39:13.792
Yeah, I think that's all right.

39:13.792 --> 39:14.959
I'll just tie one more knot.

39:14.959 --> 39:15.959
Oh, this looks awesome.

39:15.959 --> 39:17.250
[sighs]

39:17.250 --> 39:18.584
Okay, so who's going after me?

39:18.584 --> 39:19.792
Do you wanna come up?

39:19.792 --> 39:20.959
Cheers up.

39:20.959 --> 39:23.584
-Woo!
-Whoa!

39:23.584 --> 39:25.501
Gary!

39:25.501 --> 39:26.584
All right, you ready?

39:26.584 --> 39:28.167
You're a brave man, my friend.

39:28.167 --> 39:30.375
-Woo-hoo!
-Ooh!

39:30.375 --> 39:32.042
That's terrifying.

39:32.042 --> 39:37.334
-Go for it.
-Woo-hoo!

39:37.334 --> 39:39.042
Becky!

39:39.042 --> 39:40.375
Woo!

39:40.375 --> 39:43.959
[cheering]

39:43.959 --> 39:45.959
Yes!

39:45.959 --> 39:49.083
I wanna do it again!

39:49.083 --> 39:51.751
Pink peppercorn
Crème brûlée.

39:51.751 --> 39:54.584
Hey, Ashley, you can
go on your break.

39:54.584 --> 39:55.959
I think I'm gonna get Scarlett
to do dinner service tonight.

39:55.959 --> 39:58.083
Yes, I was figuring
that was probably...

39:58.083 --> 39:59.584
And you can do it
tomorrow night.

39:59.584 --> 40:00.709
Copy.

40:00.709 --> 40:02.375
You're doing,
like, family-style?

40:02.375 --> 40:04.959
-Okay.
-Yeah.

40:04.959 --> 40:08.125
Nonstop.

40:08.125 --> 40:10.876
Woo!

40:10.876 --> 40:12.959
Oh!

40:12.959 --> 40:14.542
Oh, my God...

40:14.542 --> 40:15.959
Can I get anyone a drink?

40:15.959 --> 40:17.584
-Are you good?
-Yeah, I'm good, thank you.

40:17.584 --> 40:20.375
Yeah, they're done.

40:20.375 --> 40:23.709
The stinging back.

40:23.709 --> 40:25.083
So, you're gonna do
dinner service with me.

40:25.083 --> 40:26.375
Yay!

40:26.375 --> 40:28.375
And Ashley is
gonna do turn-downs.

40:28.375 --> 40:31.959
I'm about to go
change into blacks.

40:31.959 --> 40:35.626
[bleep]
Ow.

40:35.626 --> 40:37.167
-I'm behind.
-You're behind?

40:37.167 --> 40:38.751
I have two hours and a half.

40:38.751 --> 40:41.959
I'm gonna make, like,
octopus, a lot of seafood.

40:41.959 --> 40:43.834
If you need a hand, just shout
[speaks Spanish]

40:43.834 --> 40:44.876
Yeah.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.501
Well, I mean, I prefer you
not ask for my help,

40:46.501 --> 40:48.375
because I don't really want to.

40:48.375 --> 40:50.834
Do you want to start
pulling for dinner?

40:50.834 --> 40:53.125
It's a white party,
so everything white.

40:53.125 --> 40:54.542
-So, all white.
-Yeah, exactly.

40:54.542 --> 41:03.209
-Yay, fun.
-Yeah.

41:03.209 --> 41:14.834
You are.
I'm here for moral support.

41:14.834 --> 41:18.667
I'll be back.

41:18.667 --> 41:21.918
We'd better be doing the white
hot tub party after dinner.

41:21.918 --> 41:22.959
Ooh!

41:22.959 --> 41:24.167
[bleep]

41:24.167 --> 41:25.876
I got the very bad news.

41:25.876 --> 41:28.375
You know, my best friend,
which is like brother

41:28.375 --> 41:34.250
for my whole family,
his mom just died.

41:34.250 --> 41:42.292
Mari?

41:42.292 --> 41:44.501
-[bleep]
-I'm excited for tonight.

41:44.501 --> 41:46.167
What time is dinner?
We said 8:30ish?

41:46.167 --> 41:52.918
Yeah.

41:52.918 --> 41:58.375
The last thing I wanna do
right now is cook.

41:58.375 --> 42:00.918
[sniffling]

42:00.918 --> 42:02.792
Ah [bleep].

42:02.792 --> 42:06.751
Ah... sh--.

42:06.751 --> 42:08.417
Next, on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

42:08.417 --> 42:09.584
We wanna do a relay.

42:09.584 --> 42:11.209
All right, we be a
team of pirates

42:11.209 --> 42:14.334
ready to take on
you navy bastards!

42:14.334 --> 42:15.375
[blows whistle]

42:15.375 --> 42:17.125
[shouting]

42:17.125 --> 42:25.167
Oh, no!

42:25.167 --> 42:27.959
I feel so guilty.

42:27.959 --> 42:29.167
[bleep] this.

42:29.167 --> 42:30.542
She's going to bed at 12:00,

42:30.542 --> 42:31.876
and she doesn't need
to be having,

42:31.876 --> 42:33.375
like, a heart-to-heart
with Gary right now.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.375
I'm totally ----ing
with Gary's fun.

42:35.375 --> 42:41.792
He ----ing deserves it.

42:41.792 --> 42:42.876
Should we wake Glenn up?

42:42.876 --> 42:44.000
I'm gonna fire up.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.876
-Oh!
-The horizon is spinning.

42:45.876 --> 42:47.626
This shallow's right
behind us now.

42:47.626 --> 42:49.959
I'm gonna come ahead a little
bit to stay off of it.

42:49.959 --> 42:52.542
We've got a chain wrapped
around the anchor chain.

42:52.542 --> 42:54.375
If we can't get
these anchors up,

42:54.375 --> 42:56.501
then we're gonna
continue to drag

42:56.501 --> 42:58.751
and we're gonna end up hitting
these little tiny boats.

42:58.751 --> 43:02.751
Stop, stop, stop!
Mother----er.
