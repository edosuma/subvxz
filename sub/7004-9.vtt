00:01.867 --> 00:03.902
Ha! Welcome back to <i>tool time.</i>

00:03.903 --> 00:06.905
Over the years, we've received
mail from astute viewers

00:06.906 --> 00:10.575
That have noticed that
both tim and I are left-handed.

00:10.576 --> 00:13.211
I'm left-handed?
That is right.

00:13.212 --> 00:17.682
That is why we're doing
our <i>tool time</i> salute...

00:17.683 --> 00:20.685
...To lefties.

00:20.686 --> 00:23.488
Only 10% of the population
is left-handed.

00:23.489 --> 00:27.092
That's true. Perhaps that is
why there are so many derogatory
terms about us.

00:27.093 --> 00:29.560
Such as "left-back."

00:29.561 --> 00:31.062
"left-out."

00:31.063 --> 00:36.067
When someone's clumsy,
what's that?
Tim.

00:36.068 --> 00:39.070
When's the last time you
southpaws picked up
right-handed scissors, going:

00:39.071 --> 00:41.840
"I can't cut it.
My arm's cramping"?

00:41.841 --> 00:45.176
Or sheared a sheep with
right-handed sheep shears?

00:45.177 --> 00:49.047
Well, speaking for me only,
last time I sheared a sheep
was shome time ago.

00:52.985 --> 00:56.054
See? When I use my left-handed
scissors, with the blade on top,

00:56.055 --> 00:59.624
I can now cut with all the
confidence of a right-hander.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.526
Snip, snip.

01:01.527 --> 01:03.161
<i>(hums)</i>

01:14.040 --> 01:17.709
And here we have
left-handed pruning shears.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.911
If you go with these, your
pruning will move a lot faster.

01:19.912 --> 01:23.715
If you go with prunes,
you'll move a lot faster.

01:23.716 --> 01:27.451
Let's show the audience how
two lefties can prune with
left-handed tools.

01:27.452 --> 01:30.689
My pleasure.
We'll see who's
the quicker shearer here.

01:30.690 --> 01:35.126
Yes, we will.
Klaus, some pruning music,
please.

01:35.127 --> 01:37.395
<i>(â™ª "saber dance"</i>
<i>by khachaturian)</i>

02:32.384 --> 02:35.787
Hi, mom.
You're finally getting
rid of that junk from your room.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.624
This is the centerpiece
I made at school for
thanksgiving.

02:41.260 --> 02:44.695
And gosh, it's beautiful.

02:44.696 --> 02:46.831
Thanks, mom.
You know what?

02:46.832 --> 02:49.901
You should take that over
to wilson's when we go for
thanksgiving.

02:49.902 --> 02:51.136
Ok.

02:51.137 --> 02:54.072
Hi.
Hi.

02:54.073 --> 02:57.108
It still smells in here.
What is that smell?
I don't know.

02:57.109 --> 02:59.911
It's like that fish that
wilson cooks at christmas.

02:59.912 --> 03:02.247
You mean lutefisk?
Remember last year?

03:02.248 --> 03:06.184
There were skunks
picketing the neighborhood.

03:08.387 --> 03:10.755
This is way worse
than lutefisk.

03:10.756 --> 03:13.992
Nothing is worse
than lutefisk.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.060
Where's that smell...?

03:18.164 --> 03:20.298
Get away from me!

03:39.318 --> 03:42.053
It's here.
It's here. Ugh!

03:42.054 --> 03:44.722
There it is.
Probably a dead rodent. Rat.

03:44.723 --> 03:47.158
A dead rat! Ew!

03:47.159 --> 03:51.696
Don't say "ew."
something good will come
out of this.

03:51.697 --> 03:55.166
What good can come out
of a dead rodent in your wall?

03:55.167 --> 03:57.735
I get to knock
a big hole in there.

04:01.506 --> 04:03.774
Dad, do we have to
do this with you?

04:09.414 --> 04:10.949
Yes.

04:12.484 --> 04:16.019
Hands-on rat removal
turns boys into men.

04:16.021 --> 04:20.423
You said the same thing about
us cleaning out the garbage
disposal.

04:20.425 --> 04:23.094
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

04:23.095 --> 04:26.197
We have struck rat.

04:26.198 --> 04:29.767
<i>(imitates james</i> <i>cagney)</i>
you dirty rat.

04:34.907 --> 04:38.609
Oh, that's where
that glove went.

04:38.610 --> 04:41.779
Dad, I hate to tell you this,
but that's not a rat.

04:41.780 --> 04:45.416
Yeah. A dead rat
looks like this.

04:47.319 --> 04:49.453
We're out of here.

04:51.891 --> 04:53.892
Whoa!

04:53.893 --> 04:56.227
It stinks even worse
than before.

04:56.228 --> 04:57.929
'cause I knocked some holes
in the wall.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.397
Well, did you find
a dead rat?

04:59.398 --> 05:02.133
No, but I'm hot
on his tail.

05:04.270 --> 05:07.939
But I'll take care of the smell.
I got this industrial
disinfectant.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.074
With a zesty scent of lemon.

05:10.075 --> 05:13.344
This lemon stuff is
worse than the rat.

05:13.345 --> 05:16.781
You'll get used to it.
<i>(doorbell)</i>

05:16.782 --> 05:22.353
Hi, can I help you?
I'm the home appraiser from
the royal oak bank. <i>(sniffs)</i>

05:25.524 --> 05:28.626
And right now,
I'm thinking low.

05:28.627 --> 05:33.464
No, we have a dead rat in
the wall. I think you have
the wrong house.

05:33.465 --> 05:38.102
508 glenview road?
No, this is 510.
508 is...

05:38.103 --> 05:40.138
...Wilson's house,
next-door.

05:40.139 --> 05:41.973
I'm sorry to bother you.

05:46.078 --> 05:48.512
Why would wilson
have his house appraised?

05:48.513 --> 05:53.851
I don't know. Well, people
do it all the time.
Maybe he's refinancing.

05:53.852 --> 05:57.488
Or maybe he wants to know what
it's worth so he can sell it.

05:57.489 --> 06:00.825
I don't think he'd sell
the house without telling
us about it.

06:00.826 --> 06:03.328
Gosh, I hope he's not
having financial problems.

06:03.329 --> 06:09.834
Well, he has been wearing that
hat for an awful long time.

06:09.835 --> 06:12.270
I bet he wants to sell
his house.

06:12.271 --> 06:16.040
No. I think you're jumping
to conclusions.
Hm.

06:16.041 --> 06:18.109
I smell a rat.

06:19.644 --> 06:21.779
Why did we have to get
all dressed up?

06:21.780 --> 06:26.817
'cause our parents made us,
we're making you, that's why.

06:26.818 --> 06:29.988
Let me find out why wilson
is having his house appraised.

06:29.989 --> 06:33.191
It may be a sensitive subject
and you don't know how to be
subtle.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.759
My middle name is subtle.
Yeah.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.863
And your first name
is not.

06:43.168 --> 06:45.970
Well, hi-de-ho,
taylor lads.

06:45.971 --> 06:49.507
I brought you this.
Why, thank you, mark.

06:49.508 --> 06:54.045
This'll make a wonderful
addition to our table.
Welcome to my humble haven.

06:54.046 --> 07:00.718
Hey, speaking of a humble haven
- what's a haven like this
go for?

07:00.719 --> 07:05.256
I brought you a pumpkin pie
for dessert.
Thank you, jill.

07:05.257 --> 07:07.591
Mm, that smells lemony.

07:07.592 --> 07:09.994
Come on in.

07:09.995 --> 07:13.264
Um, want me to take
this to the kitchen?
Sure.

07:13.265 --> 07:17.068
And guys,
don't touch anything.
Don't tell us, tell dad.

07:17.069 --> 07:23.174
Last time we were over here,
he was the one that accidentally
shot off the cannon.

07:23.175 --> 07:25.543
What do ya got in
the tropical room?
Myna bird.

07:25.544 --> 07:29.947
<i>(bird squawks)</i>
hi-de-ho, good neighbor.

07:29.948 --> 07:32.850
It's got a beak on it,
doesn't it?
<i>(bird bites tim)</i>

07:32.851 --> 07:35.819
Wilson!
Mozart, let him go.

07:39.824 --> 07:43.461
Hey, wilson. I never
noticed this mask.
Yeah, me neither.

07:43.462 --> 07:46.364
I never pictured you much
as a hockey goalie.

07:46.365 --> 07:49.167
Actually, brad, that's from
a tribe in uganda.

07:49.168 --> 07:52.903
It's a ceremonial mask
that was used when
a young man was circumcised.

07:57.909 --> 08:00.611
He wore the mask
so you couldn't see him...

08:04.849 --> 08:06.850
Wilson, you changed
the room again.

08:06.851 --> 08:09.087
It looks wonderful.
You went all-out.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.456
I tried to recreate
the first thanksgiving.

08:11.457 --> 08:15.025
I brought out my traditional
algonquin and pilgrim artifacts.

08:17.463 --> 08:21.332
You overcooked it, wilson.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.501
That's indian corn, tim.

08:23.502 --> 08:26.571
Hey, wilson. Do you think
I could try on this suit of
armor?

08:26.572 --> 08:31.008
That won't fit you.
It's 46, long, right?
With extra rivets.

08:31.009 --> 08:35.513
Maybe next time. Make yourselves
comfortable. Turkey will be in
ten minutes.

08:35.514 --> 08:38.716
Hey, wilson. Do you think
maybe I could check out
the waterfall?

08:38.717 --> 08:41.652
No, that's out of order.
But if you boys want,

08:41.653 --> 08:44.121
You can play with
my orient express train set.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.056
Hey, cool. Where is it?

08:46.057 --> 08:49.893
Third door on the left, past
the tibetan meditation room,
right before the can.

08:49.894 --> 08:53.331
Thanks, wilson.
Hey, wilson.

08:53.332 --> 08:57.034
Speaking of trains - you know,
trains move people, people move.

08:57.035 --> 08:58.902
<i>(grunts)</i>

08:58.903 --> 09:02.106
I think my rib just moved.

09:02.107 --> 09:05.376
Wilson, these hors d'oeuvres
look really interesting.

09:05.377 --> 09:08.346
Those are authentic
pilgrim foretastes.
Mm.

09:08.347 --> 09:10.714
That's eel pie.
Mm.

09:22.394 --> 09:28.332
This is really wonderful,
you know - friends getting
together in the holidays.

09:28.333 --> 09:31.435
Friends who would do
anything for each other.

09:31.436 --> 09:35.039
All righty.
Cabernet 1936.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.708
All right. Dig in,
before that eel gets cold.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.843
Um, wilson...

09:39.844 --> 09:44.482
What I'm trying to say
is that if you ever need
anything,

09:44.483 --> 09:46.651
You should come to us.

09:46.652 --> 09:49.119
Do you need cash
or are you moving?

09:53.258 --> 09:54.758
Very subtle, tim.

09:54.759 --> 09:58.563
I assume this has something
to do with that appraiser

09:58.564 --> 10:00.698
Who mistakenly stopped by
your house.

10:00.699 --> 10:04.868
Yes, it does. We'd like to know
what's going on with you.

10:04.869 --> 10:07.137
Why didn't you just ask me
in the first place?

10:07.138 --> 10:12.543
You know us, we're not
the kind of couple
that wants to pry.

10:12.544 --> 10:17.281
I didn't want to mention it,
I was afraid it would crimp
the holiday,

10:17.282 --> 10:20.551
But since you brought it up...
I'm moving.

10:20.552 --> 10:24.488
What? Why?

10:24.489 --> 10:27.157
It was a difficult decision.
I did a lot of soul-searching.

10:27.158 --> 10:29.960
It's just something
that I feel that I have to do.

10:29.961 --> 10:33.297
I hope there's
nothing wrong.
No, there's nothing wrong.

10:33.298 --> 10:38.269
It's long been my dream to
settle in the mindo-nambillo
forest of western ecuador.

10:43.041 --> 10:46.410
Western ecuador?

10:46.411 --> 10:48.779
We all have that dream.

10:51.583 --> 10:53.718
But nobody runs off
and does it.

10:53.719 --> 10:56.254
What are you gonna do
in mindo-nambillo?

10:56.255 --> 11:00.558
I'm gonna live in an enchanted
forest, I'm gonna renew
my spirit, fill my soul,

11:00.559 --> 11:02.893
And discover my true place
in the universe.

11:02.894 --> 11:05.596
Can't you just go for
the weekend?

11:15.039 --> 11:17.141
It stinks.

11:17.142 --> 11:20.878
Yeah, I think it's worse
than before.

11:20.879 --> 11:23.347
No. I mean wilson moving.
Oh.

11:23.348 --> 11:28.352
That stinks too.
Yeah. Sure does.

11:28.353 --> 11:32.456
I can't stand
that smell anymore.
I'm gonna get that rat.

11:32.457 --> 11:36.627
I just can't believe that he's
leaving. Why would he pick up
and go like that?

11:36.628 --> 11:38.562
He told you why.

11:38.563 --> 11:42.933
He's going down to
kumbaya-gumbah...

11:42.934 --> 11:47.204
...To rekindle his spirit
and fillet his soul.

11:48.507 --> 11:51.509
Well, I am really gonna
miss him.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.877
I'm really gonna miss him.

11:53.878 --> 11:56.280
He's always been there
whenever we needed him.

11:56.281 --> 11:59.082
You can be honest with him
and he never judges you.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.319
I always felt like he was
a member of the family.

12:01.320 --> 12:06.190
I like him better
than most of your family.

12:07.626 --> 12:10.828
That thing must have slipped...
Oh, oh. Oh, I got it.

12:10.829 --> 12:12.763
Are you sure it's not
another glove?

12:12.764 --> 12:15.366
No. Here's a real
smelly little rat.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.234
Get the bag.
No way!

12:17.235 --> 12:20.971
You get the rat
and I'll get the bag.
I'll get the bag.

12:23.141 --> 12:25.075
Oh!
Ok, wait a minute.

12:25.076 --> 12:27.678
Phew!

12:27.679 --> 12:29.714
Oh!

12:32.250 --> 12:34.618
What am I supposed to
do with it?

12:34.619 --> 12:36.821
Well, either take it out
and throw it out,

12:36.822 --> 12:39.390
Or take it to school for
show and smell. I don't care.

12:40.459 --> 12:42.426
Tim, come on!

12:42.427 --> 12:44.328
All right,
I'll throw it out.

12:44.329 --> 12:47.998
Put it in the can
farthest away from the house.

12:47.999 --> 12:51.969
Why don't I just give it to
wilson? He can take it to
jumbo-mamambo with him.

12:51.970 --> 12:55.439
It's mindo-nambillo.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.208
I don't care.

12:58.209 --> 13:01.311
I just don't wanna lose
my best friend.

13:01.312 --> 13:03.947
Who am I gonna talk to
when things bother me?

13:03.948 --> 13:07.618
Oh, gee, let me think.
Hm? Who could you talk to?

13:07.619 --> 13:10.688
I can't talk to you
about what bothers me.

13:10.689 --> 13:14.258
Why not?
'cause most of the time
it's about you.

13:17.362 --> 13:21.999
It's not gonna be
the same without him.
I know.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.334
He's been like a father to me.
I look up to him.

13:24.335 --> 13:26.771
I just can't believe
how close we've gotten.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.306
Remember how weird we thought
he was when we first moved in?

13:29.307 --> 13:31.842
How could I forget?

13:31.843 --> 13:36.980
He was hanging upside down from
that tree imitating the mating
call of a possum.

13:38.116 --> 13:40.851
Remember how many
horny possums showed up?

13:46.925 --> 13:48.893
Oh, what a beautiful tree.

13:48.894 --> 13:51.462
That's a blue juniper.

13:51.463 --> 13:54.498
I really like this house.
Don't you, fred?
I love it.

13:54.499 --> 13:59.837
Let's make him an offer.
Not so fast, francine.

13:59.838 --> 14:02.606
<i>(clears throat)</i>
come on. Level with me.

14:02.607 --> 14:04.408
Is anything wrong with
this place?

14:04.409 --> 14:06.477
No, no, no.
Nothing at all.

14:06.478 --> 14:09.112
It's been a great house,
with great neighbors.

14:09.113 --> 14:10.581
Uh-huh.

14:10.582 --> 14:14.251
Um, would you mind showing me
the kitchen just one more time?

14:14.252 --> 14:17.387
No, no. Not at all.
And is that stove in there
gas or electric?

14:17.388 --> 14:21.224
It's wood.
It's wood.

14:21.225 --> 14:24.728
Hey, there.
How are you doing?

14:24.729 --> 14:26.831
Couldn't help overhearing your
conversation wtih wilson.

14:26.832 --> 14:31.535
Wait a minute. Aren't you that
guy who has that cable tool show
on channel 122?

14:31.536 --> 14:32.570
Yeah.

14:34.339 --> 14:39.844
On saturdays, we simulcast
in spanish on 88.

14:39.845 --> 14:42.746
You gonna buy
wilson's house?
That depends.

14:42.747 --> 14:44.748
Let me ask you something.

14:44.749 --> 14:47.184
Is anything wrong
with this place?

14:50.989 --> 14:54.725
No. He takes real good
care of it.
Uh-huh.

14:54.726 --> 14:59.029
Let me ask you something.
Do you ever use the term,
"hi-de-ho"?

14:59.030 --> 15:02.800
Yeah. When it's off to
work I go.

15:04.335 --> 15:08.071
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:08.072 --> 15:11.108
Can you do
a horny possum call?

15:13.011 --> 15:16.146
What are you?
Some kind of pervert?
No.

15:16.147 --> 15:21.084
Do you own an african
circumcision mask?

15:21.085 --> 15:24.054
No. I rent.

15:24.055 --> 15:26.423
Francine!
Jill!

15:28.426 --> 15:33.330
Hi, there, wilson.
Hi-ho, elevated neighbor.

15:33.331 --> 15:35.098
So what are you doing?

15:35.099 --> 15:38.402
Patching the hole I think that
rat got in. What are you up to?

15:38.403 --> 15:42.406
While it's warm enough,
I'm trying to patch up
some cracks in my driveway,

15:42.407 --> 15:44.708
But the cement seems too lumpy.

15:44.709 --> 15:49.547
My rule with cement - if it's
got less lumps than jill's
gravy, it's probably all right.

15:51.115 --> 15:53.483
I'll take a look
at it for you.

15:53.484 --> 15:57.955
Well, did mr. Happy
and mrs. Go-lucky
make you an offer?

15:57.956 --> 16:02.426
No, but they seemed
very interested.

16:02.427 --> 16:05.863
You know, I read it's bad luck
to take the first offer.

16:05.864 --> 16:08.966
Where did you read that?
Uh...

16:08.967 --> 16:14.504
<i>Superstitions in real estate.</i>
It's a handbook I picked up.

16:14.505 --> 16:18.341
That's really way too thick.
Give me your hose and I'll show
you how to thin it out.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.714
Oh, boy.

16:23.715 --> 16:27.150
Well, I can see where
my next repair comes from.

16:27.151 --> 16:31.855
That's all right. Just use
my hose. Turn it on before
you wheel it over the fence.

16:31.856 --> 16:35.225
It's a funny thing how we let
things go when we're living
in a place,

16:35.226 --> 16:38.562
Then we decide to move and we
fix it up for somebody else.

16:38.563 --> 16:41.732
Somebody else.

16:41.733 --> 16:44.635
Boy, it's gonna be hard
living next-door to
somebody else.

16:44.636 --> 16:48.538
Tim, would you mind listening
while I ruminate?

16:48.539 --> 16:51.976
No. Go ahead.
Use the bush over by the gazebo.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.985
No, I mean can I use you
as a sounding board?

17:00.986 --> 17:02.987
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sound away.

17:02.988 --> 17:07.156
You need a little bit more.
A little slack, little slack,
little slack.

17:07.157 --> 17:09.425
Tim, the last few days
I've been thinking.

17:09.426 --> 17:14.031
Do you remember a long time ago
I told you and jill
that I'd once been married?

17:14.031 --> 17:15.766
Yes, I do.

17:15.767 --> 17:19.536
And that my wife passed away
before I moved in?

17:19.537 --> 17:23.205
You didn't say much else so we
figured it was hard for you to
talk about.

17:23.207 --> 17:25.876
Well, it still is, tim.

17:25.877 --> 17:32.683
You know, we would have been
married this month for 25 years.

17:32.684 --> 17:36.386
You see, tim, I met kathryn
in mindo-nambillo.

17:36.387 --> 17:42.092
We fell in love and made a vow
to return there on our
silver wedding anniversary.

17:43.662 --> 17:45.495
So that's why you
wanna move back there?

17:45.496 --> 17:49.366
Yeah, in part.

17:49.367 --> 17:53.871
You see, tim, I feel like
my memories of kathryn are
starting to fade.

17:53.872 --> 17:58.742
And it's just like I'm losing
her all over again, and I can't
let that happen.

17:59.944 --> 18:02.412
Jeez.

18:02.413 --> 18:05.082
She sounds like she's
real special, wilson.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.652
Oh. Yes, indeedy.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.122
Kathryn was one of a kind.

18:12.123 --> 18:15.592
She was the kindest,
gentlest person you ever met.

18:15.593 --> 18:17.427
How did you meet her?

18:17.428 --> 18:21.865
Well, it was one of those
chance encounters in the forest.

18:21.866 --> 18:24.101
Kathryn was a botany buff.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.737
I had a flare for
flying mammalia.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.209
One night, in a clearing,
our paths crossed

18:32.210 --> 18:34.078
While waiting for the night
blooming orchids

18:34.079 --> 18:37.347
To be pollinated by
the nocturnal bats.

18:39.718 --> 18:43.120
That's pretty
romantic stuff.

18:43.121 --> 18:47.825
Oh, yes. There were many
breathtaking images in
that forest under the moonlight,

18:47.826 --> 18:49.860
But they all pale
next to kathryn.

18:49.861 --> 18:54.164
When you talk about her,
doesn't it seem like she's here?

18:54.165 --> 18:56.867
Yeah, it does to me.

18:56.868 --> 19:02.372
Boy, I don't know. I guess it's
been a long time since I spoke
to anyone about her.

19:02.373 --> 19:07.010
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

19:07.011 --> 19:14.885
Wilson, I'm reminded of what
one of the great thinkers of
our time said.

19:14.886 --> 19:20.791
Really? Who was that?
Mario andretti.

19:20.792 --> 19:23.994
Just as he retired from racing,
he told a group of people

19:23.995 --> 19:28.698
That you don't need the ignition
in the car to keep the thrill of
the race alive.

19:28.699 --> 19:32.402
You just gotta keep in touch
with your pit crew.

19:37.142 --> 19:40.978
Well, that is very beautiful.
But how does it apply to me?

19:40.979 --> 19:44.982
Do I have to spell out
everything for you?

19:46.717 --> 19:49.486
You don't need to move
to keep the memory alive.

19:49.487 --> 19:55.225
You just gotta share it
with people that are here.

19:55.226 --> 19:57.060
Like you?

19:57.061 --> 20:01.665
I might not understand every
word, but I'm here and I listen.

20:01.666 --> 20:06.469
You know, tim, I think
I know what you're saying.

20:06.470 --> 20:08.571
I may take you up on that offer.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.810
Really?

20:15.013 --> 20:20.884
Really.
So you're not gonna
move to bobo-brazil?

20:20.885 --> 20:26.523
No. No, I think I'm gonna
stay right here.
All right.

20:26.524 --> 20:28.826
That's real good news.
That's real good news.

20:28.827 --> 20:33.463
'cause if that other guy
moved in, I'd have to fly to
jumbo-jambalaya every weekend.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.500
Actually, there are
no direct flights there.

20:37.501 --> 20:40.938
When I first met kathryn,
you had to take a mule from
latacunga.

20:40.939 --> 20:42.940
I'm sorry I never met kathryn.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.975
Oh, you would have
liked her, tim.

20:44.976 --> 20:47.177
You would have liked her.

20:47.178 --> 20:50.047
We were like two dicotyledons
in a phaseolus.

20:50.048 --> 20:53.016
What?
Two peas in a pod.

20:53.017 --> 20:56.419
Would you like to see
a picture of kathryn?
I'd love to.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.455
What else don't I know
about you, wilson?

20:58.456 --> 21:03.227
Were you ever a spy?
Well, I could tell you, tim,
but then I'd have to kill you.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.202
<i>(wilson blows through conch)</i>

21:24.715 --> 21:27.751
Are you calling moose, wilson?

21:27.752 --> 21:30.053
No, jill, this is a conch shell.

21:30.054 --> 21:32.990
They blow it in hawaii
to celebrate thanksgiving.

21:32.991 --> 21:35.392
Wow.

21:35.393 --> 21:40.264
Well, I have a lot to be
thankful for this thanksgiving.

21:41.799 --> 21:45.002
High on my list
would be you deciding to stay.

21:45.003 --> 21:48.438
Thank you. It was tim's advice
that helped solve my problem.

21:48.439 --> 21:54.111
Wow. So that score would be:
Tim - one, wilson - 10,000.

21:54.112 --> 21:57.080
<i>(wilson chuckles)</i>
I never keep score.

21:57.081 --> 22:00.350
I've got some leftovers.
You wanna come over for lunch?

22:00.351 --> 22:03.320
I'll make elt sandwiches.
Elt?

22:03.321 --> 22:06.689
Eel, lettuce and tomato.

22:06.690 --> 22:12.095
I'd love to, wilson,
but I've discovered
that I'm allergic to eel.

22:12.096 --> 22:14.264
I think kathryn was too.

22:14.265 --> 22:17.334
Either that or she didn't like
it and was just being polite.

22:18.769 --> 22:22.239
I think I would have had
a lot in common with kathryn.

22:22.240 --> 22:26.343
I think you would have too.

22:26.344 --> 22:30.580
You know, I started going
through some things after
I talked to tim.

22:30.581 --> 22:33.317
Would you like to see
a wedding photograph?

22:33.318 --> 22:35.319
I'd love to.

22:37.388 --> 22:39.489
<i>(jill laughs)</i>

22:50.168 --> 22:53.536
Really high on my list would be
that you decided to stay.

22:53.537 --> 22:59.809
Well, thank you. Actually,
it was jill's advice
that helped me...

22:59.810 --> 23:02.745
I've got some leftovers.
You wanna come for lunch
tomorrow?

23:02.746 --> 23:05.482
I'll make some eel,
lettuce...

23:05.483 --> 23:06.516
Rat.

23:11.822 --> 23:15.558
You're almost there.
Just two more words!
