WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:07.554
The Vault will soon be the pinnacle of
ultra-maximum-security incarceration.

00:07.763 --> 00:12.017
Put a super-villain in here,
and trust me, he's never getting out.

00:12.226 --> 00:14.394
Music to my ears, Osborn.

00:14.603 --> 00:17.773
Now that we're finally
putting this reprobate behind bars...

00:17.940 --> 00:20.609
...I don't want him
seeing the light of day any time soon.

00:20.776 --> 00:23.695
You don't have to take
quite so much pleasure in this, Jonah.

00:24.029 --> 00:27.950
Oh, but I do. I really, really do.

01:42.524 --> 01:45.027
Wow, haven't been "in stir"
five minutes

01:45.193 --> 01:48.655
and already I'm climbing the walls.
Get it?

01:48.864 --> 01:50.699
No? No love?

01:50.907 --> 01:53.493
Fine. Hey, just remember,
I'm only here...

01:53.702 --> 01:56.413
...because Normikins asked me
to test the security.

01:56.622 --> 02:02.586
<i>So if you're watching, and I know you
are, Picklepuss, don't get any ideas.</i>

02:08.383 --> 02:11.053
Delivery. Yet another
OsCorp sensor system for the Vault.

02:12.512 --> 02:14.473
All right. Everything seems in order.

02:14.681 --> 02:16.808
You know where to go?

02:17.017 --> 02:19.478
Idoindeed.

02:24.733 --> 02:28.403
Never thought I'd find myself
busting into prison.

02:29.154 --> 02:31.865
One hour. Curtain in one hour.

02:33.325 --> 02:35.535
My cast is battling stage fright...

02:36.995 --> 02:39.122
...and the director's battling
stage panic.

02:39.331 --> 02:42.334
Where is my Puck?
Where is Harry Osborn?

02:42.542 --> 02:43.585
Working on it.

02:43.794 --> 02:45.545
Hello, Gwen? Hey, it's M.J.

02:45.754 --> 02:46.963
<i>Have you seen Harry?</i>

02:47.172 --> 02:49.633
<i>His butler said
he left home hours ago...</i>

02:49.841 --> 02:52.886
...but he's beyond late
and not answering his OsBerry.

02:53.095 --> 02:55.222
Sorry, I haven't seen him all day.

02:55.430 --> 02:59.393
But he's so excited about the show.
I'm sure he'll be there.

02:59.685 --> 03:01.186
<i>It's Pete. Message me.</i>

03:01.395 --> 03:06.191
Hi, Petey.
Just a little reminder about the play.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.194
Since Mark can't be here...

03:09.403 --> 03:12.781
...I really need a friendly face
in the seat I saved you.

03:12.989 --> 03:14.324
Next to my parents?

03:14.533 --> 03:16.535
Remember, you promised.

03:16.743 --> 03:18.787
Where is my Puck?

03:18.995 --> 03:20.580
And call if you've seen Harry.

03:27.337 --> 03:29.506
<i>Alarm bypassed for maintenance.</i>

03:36.847 --> 03:40.308
All right, little stolen OsBerry,
do your stuff.

03:40.517 --> 03:42.060
<i>Mapping Vault utilities.</i>

03:42.269 --> 03:45.063
<i>Charting junctures
with pre-existing prison.</i>

03:45.272 --> 03:46.940
If breaking out is this easy...

03:47.149 --> 03:50.944
...then little Felicia
will be one felicitous felonious feline.

03:52.571 --> 03:56.825
He's been like that for over an hour.
You got him beat, Osborn.

03:57.033 --> 04:00.620
Menken, I'm in the middle
of a crucial test here. What?

04:00.829 --> 04:03.123
Fine. Gentlemen.

04:03.331 --> 04:04.583
You can't leave now.

04:04.791 --> 04:07.502
You'll miss
the web-head's glorious humiliation.

04:07.711 --> 04:10.046
No choice. Urgent OsCorp business.

04:10.255 --> 04:14.259
Besides, I'm sure I'll read all
about Spider-Man in tomorrow's Bugle.

04:14.468 --> 04:17.262
Story's already written, Norm.

04:17.471 --> 04:20.682
<i>Jonah must be dancing a jig by now.
Who can blame him?</i>

04:20.891 --> 04:24.686
<i>I've checked every inch of this cell.
It's seamless.</i>

04:24.895 --> 04:27.689
<i>I want the Vault to be escape-proof...</i>

04:27.898 --> 04:31.985
<i>...but it would be sweet to see the look
on the jolly one's face if I escaped.</i>

04:32.194 --> 04:34.321
<i>I can't play jailbird forever, though.</i>

04:34.529 --> 04:37.908
<i>In a few minutes, I have to make my
move or ask to be released.</i>

04:38.116 --> 04:42.162
<i>If I miss Liz's play, I might as well
settle in here permanently...</i>

04:42.370 --> 04:45.207
<i>...because I'll never get out
of the doghouse.</i>

04:45.415 --> 04:48.919
Hello, Mr. Allan. Mrs. Allan.

04:49.127 --> 04:51.797
I see Liz's boyfriend hasn't arrived.

04:52.005 --> 04:53.381
Miss Stacy.

04:53.590 --> 04:57.469
Oh, Houseman. I thought Harry saved
these seats for his mom and dad.

04:57.677 --> 05:02.307
I'm afraid Master Harry's parents
are otherwise occupied.

05:03.099 --> 05:05.977
I just hope Harry
isn't otherwise occupied.

05:06.311 --> 05:08.230
Mr. Osborn's still a no-show.

05:08.438 --> 05:11.316
Which leaves us with only one option.

05:11.525 --> 05:16.238
I must play the Puck myself.

05:17.614 --> 05:19.825
Or Hobie could do it.

05:20.033 --> 05:22.828
Mr. Brown? He knows the role?

05:23.036 --> 05:26.456
He knows it cold. I saw him
at the Lincoln Dynamic Youth Center.

05:26.665 --> 05:30.544
He subbed for Osborn on the gridiron.
Compared to that, this'll be a snap.

05:30.752 --> 05:32.879
A snap.

05:33.547 --> 05:38.260
Well, the Muses know
I didn't want to take the stage.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.303
To the dressing room, Brown.

05:40.512 --> 05:45.517
You are now
that shrewd and knavish sprite. Go.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.731
- What he's up to?
- He's making his move.

05:51.940 --> 05:53.900
What move? He still can't get out.

05:54.109 --> 05:58.196
<i>- And</i> my <i>men will--
- Be here any second. Gotta book.</i>

06:06.746 --> 06:08.748
<i>Releasing tranq-gas into the cell.</i>

06:08.957 --> 06:10.750
We're in position.

06:11.126 --> 06:13.086
Sir, I don't see the prisoner.

06:13.295 --> 06:15.922
Opening the inner door. Move in.

06:18.341 --> 06:20.677
All right, Spidey,
we know you're in there.

06:20.886 --> 06:23.221
I wouldn't poke that if I were you.

06:26.558 --> 06:29.019
Told them not to poke that.

06:30.186 --> 06:33.732
<i>Oh, and, Picklepuss, ta-da.</i>

06:33.940 --> 06:37.527
Warden, if the web-head's not back
behind bars in 6.2 seconds, I--

06:37.736 --> 06:39.279
Calm down, Jameson.

06:39.487 --> 06:42.032
Getting out of the cell
was only half the battle.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.117
Lockdown.

06:48.330 --> 06:50.457
Gas every corridor.

06:50.665 --> 06:54.461
- Sir, the gas, it won't activate.
- Why isn't that gate closed?

06:54.669 --> 06:57.047
What part of lockdown
didn't you understand?

06:57.255 --> 07:00.634
Sir, I hit the command sequence.
All Vault gates should be closed.

07:00.842 --> 07:01.968
Nothing's responding.

07:02.177 --> 07:03.595
You've been hacked.

07:03.762 --> 07:06.473
Your men are no longer
in electronic control of the prison.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.392
Then we'll regain control
the old-fashioned way.

07:09.601 --> 07:13.855
- All officers, mobilise. Code Red.
- We're locked in.

07:17.901 --> 07:22.614
Every single one of my men
are trapped inside their stations.

07:22.822 --> 07:25.533
But how did the web-head do it?

07:25.742 --> 07:28.870
<i>With guards wrapped up
All neat and tidy</i>

07:29.079 --> 07:33.833
<i>I help, or herd, my dear friend Spidey</i>

07:34.000 --> 07:35.543
I'm in a rhyming mood tonight.

07:35.752 --> 07:37.796
<i>Surprised they haven't caught me yet.</i>

07:49.432 --> 07:51.643
This must be my floor.

07:57.357 --> 07:59.985
Hey, look. It's Spider-Man.

08:00.193 --> 08:04.030
Well, well, if it isn't Fancy Dan
and his little pal Ox.

08:04.239 --> 08:05.323
Where's Montana?

08:05.532 --> 08:07.242
Right here, bug.

08:08.910 --> 08:12.414
And rooming with
the not-so-mysterious Mysterio, I see.

08:12.622 --> 08:13.832
How's that working out?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.751
Open up these here cell doors
and we'll show you.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.629
Tempting, tempting, but, no.

08:19.838 --> 08:22.424
So you just stopped by to gloat?

08:22.632 --> 08:25.510
I was in the neighbourhood,
so how could I resist...

08:25.719 --> 08:29.222
<i>...tormenting all the crooks, thugs
and hoods I put away?</i>

08:36.563 --> 08:40.150
You know, maybe "torment"
was a poor choice of words.

08:40.357 --> 08:43.528
Finally, we're getting started.

08:47.574 --> 08:49.284
Godspeed, fair Helena.

08:49.492 --> 08:51.327
Call you me fair?

08:51.536 --> 08:53.496
That fair again unsay.

08:53.705 --> 08:56.249
Demetrius loves your fair.

08:57.125 --> 09:03.214
O, teach me with what art
you sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.

09:03.423 --> 09:06.342
<i>Take comfort.
He no more shall see my face.</i>

09:06.551 --> 09:08.762
Take him. He can't stop all of us.

09:09.137 --> 09:11.222
Now, now, boys,
no pushing, no shoving.

09:11.431 --> 09:14.851
Single file is the polite way
to attack the hero.

09:24.194 --> 09:26.237
Gracious. Who'd have guessed
convicted felons

09:26.404 --> 09:28.448
could be so unmannerly?

09:28.656 --> 09:30.158
We're wasting an opportunity.

09:30.366 --> 09:32.619
Enforcers, we need to get organised.

09:32.827 --> 09:36.706
You got yourself a posse, Silvermane.
And then some.

09:36.915 --> 09:39.501
See, you learn a lot about a guy
sharing a cell.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.504
Like whether or not he's human.

09:44.464 --> 09:46.633
Oh, man, I knew he was a bot.

09:50.053 --> 09:51.846
Now, we're getting somewhere.

09:56.851 --> 09:59.771
- Now what?
- Hi, Daddy.

09:59.979 --> 10:02.440
<i>Not sure
why the cavalry hasn't arrived...</i>

10:02.649 --> 10:06.653
<i>...but I better play keep away until
I come up with, I don't know, a plan.</i>

10:08.655 --> 10:09.823
Rematch. Rematch.

10:10.031 --> 10:12.867
- The web-head we'll shred.
- Johnny needs new shoes.

10:13.076 --> 10:14.160
I hate these guys!

10:14.369 --> 10:18.498
I love these guys. Someone
should give them their own show.

10:18.706 --> 10:21.918
Jonah, you can't seriously be rooting
against Spider-Man.

10:22.127 --> 10:25.672
He's our only hope of regaining control
of the prison. Well?

10:25.880 --> 10:27.966
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

10:28.174 --> 10:30.260
Felicia Hardy, what were you thinking?

10:30.468 --> 10:33.304
That my father shouldn't be
rotting away in prison.

10:33.513 --> 10:34.931
And what if you got caught?

10:35.140 --> 10:38.810
Last thing I want is my daughter
winding up in Rykers' ladies wing.

10:39.018 --> 10:42.856
Besides, your timing couldn't be worse.
New York's most wanted...

10:43.022 --> 10:46.234
...controls the prison, and they're
trying to exterminate Spider-Man.

10:46.442 --> 10:48.319
Spider-Man? Here?

10:52.031 --> 10:53.074
- Missed.
- Drat.

10:53.283 --> 10:54.784
Jazz hands.

10:54.993 --> 10:59.289
Knew tearing and weaving all them
sheets together was time well-spent.

10:59.706 --> 11:04.043
<i>Spider-sense tingling nonstop.
Can't grok where the next--</i>

11:08.590 --> 11:11.885
Hold him, Ox. I need the workout.

11:12.093 --> 11:13.553
Oh, boys.

11:13.761 --> 11:17.640
Is Spidey really
the best dance partner available?

11:17.849 --> 11:21.144
Have you lost your mind
or forgotten everything I taught you?

11:21.352 --> 11:24.355
What can I say? I've got a little crush.

11:24.564 --> 11:26.524
It's a chick. Here.

11:26.733 --> 11:28.943
Brilliant deduction, Sherlock.

11:29.152 --> 11:31.112
What was your first clue, Spidey?

11:31.321 --> 11:36.201
The voice, the hair,
or just the way I make you feel?

12:04.437 --> 12:06.522
Door's fighting me.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.987
That'll buy us some time at least.

12:14.948 --> 12:18.284
<i>The raging rocks
And shivering shocks</i>

12:18.493 --> 12:21.162
<i>Shall break the locks
Of prison gates.</i>

12:21.371 --> 12:22.413
<i>We will meet,</i>

12:22.622 --> 12:26.876
and there we may rehearse most
obscenely and courageously.

12:27.919 --> 12:32.465
Take pains, be perfect: adieu.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.761
How now, spirit! Whither wander you?

12:36.970 --> 12:39.639
Over hill, over dale,
Through bush, through briar,

12:39.847 --> 12:42.767
Over park, over pale,
Through flood, through fire,

12:42.976 --> 12:47.021
I do wander everywhere,
Swifter than the moon's sphere.

12:47.230 --> 12:51.776
But either I mistake your shape
and making quite,

12:51.985 --> 12:56.447
Or else you are
that shrewd and knavish sprite.

12:56.656 --> 12:59.867
Are you not he
That frights the maidens of the villagery,

13:00.076 --> 13:02.328
Misleads night-Wanderers,
laughing at their harm?

13:03.830 --> 13:08.584
Those that Goblin call you
and sweet Puck,

13:08.793 --> 13:10.461
Are you not he?

13:10.670 --> 13:14.590
Thou speak'st aright,
I am that merry wanderer of the night.

13:14.799 --> 13:20.722
<i>So Goblin wasn't the only sprite
To use the Vault for mischief tonight</i>

13:20.930 --> 13:25.560
<i>But if Spider thinks Cat evens his odds</i>

13:25.768 --> 13:28.187
<i>Gobby will open a few more pods.</i>

13:28.396 --> 13:31.482
Okay, what's going on?

13:31.691 --> 13:35.320
<i>The Goblin's your saviour
You owe him a favour</i>

13:35.528 --> 13:39.574
<i>Spidey's trapped in the prison
Put him out of commission</i>

13:39.782 --> 13:42.660
The web-creep's here?

13:43.286 --> 13:47.582
Why would I do your dirty work, Goblin?
I'm already in prison. What can you do?

13:47.790 --> 13:51.836
<i>Oh, just to be perverse
I'll activate your curse</i>

13:52.045 --> 13:57.216
<i>To prevent it getting worse
Put the web-head in a hearse</i>

13:58.926 --> 14:00.803
Get that cell open now.

14:01.012 --> 14:02.889
Cat, you're a sight for sore eyes.

14:03.097 --> 14:05.516
My curative powers
aren't limited to the eyes.

14:05.725 --> 14:08.478
Don't start. What are you doing here?

14:08.686 --> 14:11.314
- Oh, you won't like it, boy scout.
- Cat, don't.

14:11.522 --> 14:13.232
But I'm here to bust out my dad.

14:13.441 --> 14:18.654
Spider-Man, meet Walter Hardy
a.k.a. the Cat Burglar.

14:19.238 --> 14:20.656
<i>That face.</i>

14:27.246 --> 14:30.208
<i>Black Cat's father murdered
Uncle Ben.</i>

14:30.416 --> 14:33.628
I'll met by moonlight,

14:36.047 --> 14:37.590
And never met we,

14:37.757 --> 14:40.635
But with thy brawls
Thou has disturb'd our sport.

14:40.843 --> 14:41.844
<i>As in revenge,</i>

14:42.011 --> 14:44.472
<i>The ox hath therefore
stretch 'd his yoke in vain.</i>

14:44.889 --> 14:46.808
- Tricky webbing.
- Sticky webbing.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.559
And tasty too.

14:48.768 --> 14:53.147
Web-creep in there?
Then move it, pip-squeak.

14:59.404 --> 15:02.657
Just so you know, there's no way
I'm letting you bust this guy out.

15:02.865 --> 15:05.326
Says the spider
desperate for the kitty cat's help.

15:05.535 --> 15:07.870
I'm not that desperate.
Never that desperate.

15:08.079 --> 15:10.373
Gee, Dad, what'd you do to this guy?

15:10.581 --> 15:12.667
Do it, kid.

15:13.876 --> 15:15.461
Now.

15:16.671 --> 15:18.339
A simple trade, swinger.

15:18.548 --> 15:22.635
I help you get the prison under control,
and you look the other way for Walter.

15:22.802 --> 15:24.345
Do you have any idea
what happened

15:24.512 --> 15:27.432
the last time
I looked the other way for Walter?

15:27.640 --> 15:29.475
Is it getting warm in here?

15:30.685 --> 15:36.649
<i>Weaving spiders, come not here,
Hence you long-legg'd spinners, hence!</i>

15:41.070 --> 15:47.452
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again,
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note,

15:47.994 --> 15:54.083
And thy fair virtue's force doth move me
to swear, I love thee.

15:54.292 --> 15:58.880
Methinks, mistress,
you should have little reason for that,

15:59.881 --> 16:01.549
I beseech your worship's name.

16:01.757 --> 16:02.884
<i>Cobweb.</i>

16:06.179 --> 16:08.055
- Where are we?
- Back in the Vault.

16:08.264 --> 16:10.641
These tanks
hold the prison's tranq-gas.

16:10.808 --> 16:13.769
Can you activate them?
Spread the gas throughout the prison?

16:13.978 --> 16:17.315
Don't you think the warden
would have tried that? Sorry.

16:17.523 --> 16:19.358
Someone needs to lure the cons here,

16:19.525 --> 16:21.652
seal them in,
and manually open the tanks.

16:21.861 --> 16:23.988
Whoever did that
would be trapped inside.

16:24.197 --> 16:29.327
Exactly. And would a hero like you
allow anyone else to take that risk?

16:30.745 --> 16:33.331
Shall we their fond pageant see?

16:33.539 --> 16:37.960
Lord, what fools these mortals be!

16:41.464 --> 16:43.508
Send the little guy in, I tell you.

16:43.716 --> 16:46.469
I only take orders from primates.

16:46.677 --> 16:51.641
Any misbegotten malcontents misplace
an extremely handsome web-slinger?

16:51.849 --> 16:55.186
I think the turn of phrase
you're looking for is "Get him!"

16:55.394 --> 16:57.313
- Get him!
- Pistachio!

17:01.651 --> 17:06.781
<i>Up and down, up and down
I will lead them up and down</i>

17:06.989 --> 17:12.954
<i>I am fear'd in field and town
Goblin, lead them up and down</i>

17:20.545 --> 17:22.046
Can't escape Homunculi.

17:22.255 --> 17:24.257
- Trapped.
- Limited time offer.

17:26.509 --> 17:29.971
<i>Monsieur Cobweb,
get you your weapons in your hand.</i>

17:30.471 --> 17:32.390
Curses!

17:35.059 --> 17:36.894
Foiled again.

17:44.652 --> 17:48.698
Non sequitur, non sequitur, non--

17:56.080 --> 18:00.084
And you guys got to take the shortcut.
Now, how is that fair?

18:01.586 --> 18:04.797
Molten Man, bet you can't hit me
from there with a lava ball.

18:05.006 --> 18:06.215
I'll take that bet.

18:18.019 --> 18:19.770
Sucker.

18:29.196 --> 18:31.907
Where'd that bug get to now?

18:32.116 --> 18:33.951
I never tire of hearing that.

18:40.583 --> 18:42.460
Sweet dreams, cellmates.

18:42.710 --> 18:46.714
Is he kidding?
No door stops Rhino for long.

18:46.922 --> 18:49.175
I won't need long.

18:59.393 --> 19:03.064
For years, the Cat Burglar took pride
in never hurting anyone.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.191
I never even carried a gun.

19:05.399 --> 19:09.737
But as I got older, I got slower
and I became afraid.

19:10.154 --> 19:13.741
I made a horrible mistake
the night I ended Ben Parker's life...

19:14.116 --> 19:16.744
...and I know I have to pay
for my crime.

19:16.952 --> 19:18.245
So I'll turn on the gas.

19:18.454 --> 19:20.164
That won't make us even.

19:20.373 --> 19:21.415
You're not forgiven.

19:21.624 --> 19:25.169
- I understand.
- Well, I don't. Dad.

19:25.461 --> 19:27.630
<i>I'm sorry, Felicia.</i>

19:33.886 --> 19:37.723
<i>But right now,
prison's where I need to be.</i>

19:39.392 --> 19:44.814
An entire penitentiary full of
Spider-haters and still he escapes.

19:45.022 --> 19:46.524
Well, fine.

19:46.732 --> 19:51.779
(Bobby's done using surrogate
squashers and rhyme schemes.

19:54.740 --> 19:57.910
<i>Feels like my spider-sense is stuck
in permanent tingle-mode.</i>

20:25.688 --> 20:28.149
He's back. The Goblin's back.

20:28.357 --> 20:31.986
- Cat, thanks, look, I--
- Listen carefully.

20:32.403 --> 20:35.990
I don't know what you did to infect
my father with your conscience.

20:36.198 --> 20:39.660
But it's your fault he'll spend
the rest of his life in this hole.

20:40.536 --> 20:43.539
And I'll never forgive you for that.

20:44.582 --> 20:46.751
Sir, we've regained control.

20:46.959 --> 20:48.335
Gotta hand it to Spidey.

20:48.544 --> 20:51.881
He beat the Vault
and took out every con in the place.

20:52.089 --> 20:56.135
It's a conspiracy, I tell you.
They're all working together!

20:56.343 --> 20:57.595
To what end?

20:59.013 --> 21:02.349
To raise my blood pressure!

21:03.434 --> 21:07.938
<i>If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended,</i>

21:08.272 --> 21:12.318
<i>That you have but slumber'd here,
While these visions did appear.</i>

21:12.526 --> 21:16.697
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding than a dream,

21:16.906 --> 21:18.866
Else the Puck a liar call,

21:19.074 --> 21:21.035
So, good night unto you all.

21:21.243 --> 21:23.329
Give me your hands, if we be friends,

21:23.537 --> 21:27.291
And Goblin shall restore amends.
