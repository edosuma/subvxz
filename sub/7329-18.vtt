WEBVTT

00:15.650 --> 00:16.994
- My Corps.
- My Corps.

00:17.018 --> 00:18.061
- Your Corps.
- Your Corps.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.264
- Our Corps.
- Our Corps.

00:20.288 --> 00:21.899
- Marine Corps.
- Marine Corps.

00:21.923 --> 00:23.467
- Ooh-rah.
- Ooh-rah.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.302
- Ooh-rah.
- Ooh-rah.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.171
- Ooh-rah.
- Ooh-rah.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.072
Four miles to go, Marines.

00:29.096 --> 00:32.009
Back in formation, Fricker.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.178
Platoon, halt.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.914
At ease.

00:36.938 --> 00:39.650
Marine, what part of "fall in"
don't you understand?

00:39.674 --> 00:40.751
Sergeant, we got a problem.

00:40.775 --> 00:42.719
Shut yourself, Fricker.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.055
Don't answer me.
Don't even look at me.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.257
What do you think you're doing?

00:47.281 --> 00:48.839
Over there, Sergeant.

01:47.308 --> 01:53.180
Come on. Come on.
I got gum. I got...

01:54.982 --> 01:58.695
spare change, old lip balm.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.330
They're not in here.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.733
Found candy left over
from Valentine's Day.

02:02.757 --> 02:05.168
- Candy from who?
- Why does it matter?

02:05.192 --> 02:06.703
It matters
because you didn't eat it.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.740
And so that person must not
mean very much to you.

02:09.764 --> 02:12.130
- It means something.
- It means nothing.

02:14.068 --> 02:15.946
I'm glad
I wasn't your valentine.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.232
So am I.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.151
Here you go, McGee.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.486
I found this.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.720
One of my motivational CDs.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.755
I've been looking for this.

02:24.779 --> 02:26.356
Yeah, you should
have looked harder.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.525
Well, gee, I'm sorry I didn't
think to look in your desk.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.927
Hey, you know what?

02:29.951 --> 02:32.930
Whoever drove the van last
probably has the keys.

02:32.954 --> 02:35.718
Yeah!

02:36.724 --> 02:38.101
Oh, yeah.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.704
I went and got pizza yesterday
'cause I was hungry.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.039
Then what did you do
with the keys, Tony?

02:42.063 --> 02:45.108
Well, I drove back.
I ate the pizza.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.601
I threw out the box, and...

02:49.403 --> 02:50.981
You-You know what?
Today is garbage day.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.950
- You better... you better hurry.
- Where is the Dumpster?

02:52.974 --> 02:54.751
In the basement.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.887
- Did you lose something, David?
- Not I. Tony did.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.522
DiNozzo.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.190
What'd you lose? Your watch?

03:00.214 --> 03:01.758
Driver's license?

03:01.782 --> 03:02.893
Uh, neither.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.194
Got a dead body.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.295
Navy diver.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.030
Who's driving?

03:07.054 --> 03:10.133
Well, boss, uh, there's
a little problem.

03:10.157 --> 03:13.637
No, the problem is that I found
these on the elevator floor.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.973
- That's my bad.
- Uh-huh.

03:15.997 --> 03:17.107
Won't happen again.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.575
I doubt that.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.900
Meet you all downstairs.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.817
♪ Oh, I do like
to be beside the seaside ♪

03:26.841 --> 03:28.885
♪ I do like to be
beside the sea... ♪

03:28.909 --> 03:30.787
You know, strolling
on a beach like this

03:30.811 --> 03:33.323
at this time of year
reminds me of weekends

03:33.347 --> 03:37.828
we used to spend with Mother
and some friends in Brighton.

03:37.852 --> 03:40.397
They made us eat winkles.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.100
To this day,
I shudder at the thought

03:43.124 --> 03:45.168
of eating any kind of snail.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.737
I've always preferred
oysters myself.

03:46.761 --> 03:50.240
Of course you do, Jimbo.

03:50.264 --> 03:53.944
Oysters... nature's aphrodisiac.

03:53.968 --> 03:56.780
Surprised Blondie doesn't
have you shucking night and day.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.382
Pretty cute.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.783
Aw, shucks.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.786
So how is Breena anyway?

04:02.810 --> 04:04.287
Oh, excellent.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.356
She just became a union rep
for her embalmer's local.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.858
She must have quite
a pair of hands.

04:07.882 --> 04:09.679
Her talents
never cease to amaze me.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.034
Navy diver.

04:17.058 --> 04:18.535
What do you think, Duck?

04:18.559 --> 04:20.670
Well, he didn't run out of air.

04:20.694 --> 04:24.307
However, I can't rule out
nitrox poisoning.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.343
The fishies sure did
a number on him.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.978
As did a propeller.

04:28.002 --> 04:30.881
See? The blade sliced through

04:30.905 --> 04:35.285
and removed
his entire left forearm,

04:35.309 --> 04:38.422
but almost certainly
after he was dead.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.141
This was no boating accident!

04:41.816 --> 04:45.462
Richard Dreyfuss in Jaws,
you know, when he finds the arm?

04:45.486 --> 04:46.563
The medical ex...

04:46.587 --> 04:48.398
- You know that...
- I love that part, yeah.

04:48.422 --> 04:51.268
- Jaws is a classic.
- I estimate the time of death

04:51.292 --> 04:53.236
to be between
three and five days ago,

04:53.260 --> 04:56.406
based on the degree
of decomposition.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.041
Navy diver didn't
go out alone, Duck.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.910
That's a long time
not to be reported missing.

04:59.934 --> 05:01.445
Unless he wasn't supposed
to be found.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.746
McGee, details.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.915
Lieutenant Michael Jensen,
age 36.

05:04.939 --> 05:06.383
Prior enlisted.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.118
U.S. Navy master diver

05:08.142 --> 05:10.487
based out of the
Experimental Diving Unit

05:10.511 --> 05:13.256
in Panama City,
then detailed to Little Creek.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.891
Also says here he was on leave.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.494
CO wouldn't have
reported him UA.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.829
Diving on his day off.

05:18.853 --> 05:20.397
Yeah, or moonlighting.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.165
Hello, hello. What have we here?

05:22.189 --> 05:25.124
There's a puncture wound
through his wet suit.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.237
Swordfish?

05:27.261 --> 05:28.438
Doubtful.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.840
Speargun?

05:29.864 --> 05:31.842
It's difficult to tell
till I get him back.

05:31.866 --> 05:33.176
Blood loss from this

05:33.200 --> 05:35.145
would accelerate
the feeding frenzy.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.313
You were right, Jethro.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.048
Lieutenant Jensen
was not diving alone.

05:38.072 --> 05:40.917
Whoever was with him
stabbed him and then left him

05:40.941 --> 05:42.067
in the water to die.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.589
Any family?

05:45.613 --> 05:46.990
Owned a home in Portsmouth.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.158
No wife, no kids.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.343
No accident.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.736
Could have sent McGee.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.805
Yeah, could have.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.807
I wanted to see
how Jensen lived.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.343
It says a lot about a man.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.612
Take your house, for instance.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.981
Clean, no nonsense, stoic.

06:11.005 --> 06:12.716
Stoic?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.718
My house is stoic?

06:14.742 --> 06:16.453
Understated, then?

06:16.477 --> 06:18.889
I planted some roses
last weekend.

06:18.913 --> 06:20.524
Red ones.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.025
Red roses stoic?

06:22.049 --> 06:24.313
- Well, yeah, prickly and thorny...
- Door.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.598
Clear, boss.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.433
Maybe not totally clear.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.059
Toss the gun. Do it now.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.837
Take it easy, sweetheart.
Who are you?

07:07.861 --> 07:10.040
I'm not the one
breaking and entering.

07:10.064 --> 07:11.441
No, the door was open.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.476
Ladies first.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.946
It's turning into a party
around here.

07:15.970 --> 07:19.249
Wow. Looks a little
like Reservoir Dogs.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.717
Except you're cuter
than Harvey Keitel.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.352
We're federal agents.

07:22.376 --> 07:23.620
Get his I.D.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.112
Look. Don't touch.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.159
NCIS.

07:29.183 --> 07:32.262
Come on, really?

07:32.286 --> 07:33.430
Who are you guys?

07:33.454 --> 07:35.298
DEA? FBI?

07:35.322 --> 07:37.033
CGIS.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.736
Coast Guard, boss.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.905
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.206
Yeah.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.442
Put the weapon away, Kyle.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.443
Oh, yes, ma'am.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.991
That's a nice head slap.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.622
What is CGIS?

07:59.646 --> 08:01.391
Coast Guard
Investigative Service.

08:01.415 --> 08:03.593
The Coast Guard has
an investigative branch?

08:03.617 --> 08:05.461
Well, they're smaller than us,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.964
but with a wider
law enforcement reach.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.332
But it is the Coast Guard.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.767
Whoa, whoa.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.468
No need to get all uppity.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.737
Yes, Virginia, there is a CGIS.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.439
Now, they may not have
our track record,

08:16.463 --> 08:17.907
or our je ne sais quoi,

08:17.931 --> 08:20.476
but they are
a legitimate sibling.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.412
Like Corky in Life Goes On.

08:22.436 --> 08:23.413
Who?

08:23.437 --> 08:24.814
We ran into Borin

08:24.838 --> 08:26.965
and her, uh, probie
at Jensen's house.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.485
She remind you of anyone?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.120
Like who, exactly?

08:31.144 --> 08:33.222
Come on in.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.756
Get you a cup of coffee?

08:34.780 --> 08:37.360
That'd be fine, Agent Gibbs.

08:37.384 --> 08:40.654
Oh, so this is NCIS.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.081
Sorry to disappoint you.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.939
Of course, I'm going
to need to talk

08:49.963 --> 08:51.140
to your director right away.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.844
Well, my case, my questions.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.779
Jensen's Navy.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.514
The case belongs to NCIS.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.916
Well, that depends
on his involvement.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.033
How's him being dead?

09:04.911 --> 09:06.572
He still could be my killer.

09:11.485 --> 09:14.921
Okay, whose murder
are you investigating?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.371
About a week ago,
one of our recon flights

09:22.395 --> 09:23.806
spotted a salvage boat adrift

09:23.830 --> 09:25.908
about eight miles off
the coast of Virginia.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.844
Only one on board
was the captain...

09:27.868 --> 09:29.278
a guy named Martin Lyme.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.713
Found him bludgeoned to death.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.981
Case fell in my lap.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.816
How's Jensen fit?

09:33.840 --> 09:35.218
I found some security video
of Jensen

09:35.242 --> 09:36.652
and Captain Lyme
talking at the marina.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.554
My gut said he might
be worth questioning.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.156
Your gut?

09:40.180 --> 09:41.290
Yeah.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.659
I like to conduct
my own investigation.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.028
Right there with you.

09:46.052 --> 09:49.165
- Any death on a U.S.
- Registered vessel is FBI

09:49.189 --> 09:50.566
or Coast Guard jurisdiction.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.901
So where's the FBI?

09:51.925 --> 09:55.271
Told us to call
if we get close on anything.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.320
I got your number.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.843
No, you don't.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.913
So, what's your beef, Gibbs?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.348
That I'm Coast Guard?

10:05.372 --> 10:06.916
That I'm a woman?

10:06.940 --> 10:10.068
Or that I managed to get
the drop on you in that house?

10:13.346 --> 10:15.280
I don't know you.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.650
That's it?

10:21.021 --> 10:24.600
It was a maxim
of Captain Swosser...

10:24.624 --> 10:27.336
speaking in his naval
figurative manner,

10:27.360 --> 10:30.706
that "If you only have
a plank to swab,

10:30.730 --> 10:33.843
you should swab it as if
Davy Jones were after you."

10:33.867 --> 10:36.445
He was certainly
after this poor fellow.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.880
You quoting Jack Sparrow?

10:37.904 --> 10:40.449
No, no, no, Mr. Palmer.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.653
Charles Dickens...

10:43.677 --> 10:45.755
- Bleak House.
- Hmm.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.323
I prefer Treasure Island.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.758
Robert Louis Stevenson.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.726
Ah, yes.
One of my favorites, too.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.728
I used to jump up on my bed,

10:52.752 --> 10:56.699
pretend I was Jim Hawkins
sailing with Long John Silver.

10:56.723 --> 10:57.767
Oh, magnificent.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.502
How old were you, ten, nine?

10:59.526 --> 11:01.361
Uh, 23.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.309
"For the boy's story is the best
that he's ever told."

11:06.333 --> 11:07.410
Dickens.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.345
And what's his story, Duck?

11:09.369 --> 11:13.049
Well, unfortunately, much
of this poor lad's demise...

11:13.073 --> 11:14.851
well, it must remain a mystery.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.587
Dead men do tell tales,
and some better than others.

11:17.611 --> 11:21.591
I mean, he's the same height
and build as Lieutenant Jensen,

11:21.615 --> 11:23.926
but the only way
to confirm his identity

11:23.950 --> 11:26.929
- is by DNA and dental records.
- Cause of death?

11:26.953 --> 11:29.251
Being shanked by a screwdriver
didn't help.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.101
I'm sorry.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.837
Sea lice in his esophagus,
the cyanosis,

11:34.861 --> 11:39.375
oh, and nasal hemorrhage,
all point to death by drowning.

11:39.399 --> 11:43.312
Master diver drowns
swimming to shore?

11:43.336 --> 11:47.383
May I remind you, uh...
an injured diver.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.019
Even the best of us
meet our match.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.556
Abby is processing
his diving equipment.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.857
Thank you, Duck.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.325
Tread softly, Jethro.

11:56.349 --> 12:02.254
Ms. Sciuto, for some unexplained
reason, is not herself today.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.503
Aah.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.597
♪ ♪

12:15.402 --> 12:16.836
Abby.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.252
- Abbs.
- Ow!

12:23.276 --> 12:24.921
Oh. Hi.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.188
Hi.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.190
I was just cleaning, um,
Jensen's laptop.

12:28.214 --> 12:30.393
- Everything all right?
- No, it's not.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.794
What are you doing here?

12:31.818 --> 12:33.863
- I work here.
- I know what you're doing "here,"

12:33.887 --> 12:37.533
but I always know when you're
coming here, and I didn't.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.567
You don't have anything?

12:38.591 --> 12:39.936
I've got nothing.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.070
Okay, Jensen drowned,

12:41.094 --> 12:43.572
but he still had plenty
of nitrox in his tanks.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.474
I'm still processing
these little rubber things

12:45.498 --> 12:46.542
that were in his teeth.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.977
I think they're
from the regulator.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.780
And I have no idea how to get
into Jensen's laptop.

12:50.804 --> 12:54.040
He's got a code built in here
that would make the NSA proud.

12:55.241 --> 12:56.686
I'm just... I'm off my game.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.054
Well, maybe this will help.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.355
You think I didn't
try this already?

12:59.379 --> 13:00.823
I had two Caf-POW! S
this morning.

13:00.847 --> 13:03.426
That's kind of when things
started going south.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.361
I just...
I don't know what's wrong.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.529
Abbs, I need
what's in that laptop.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.563
I know you do.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.385
Maybe a hug would help.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.472
Didn't help.

13:16.496 --> 13:20.743
I guess I'm just going
to keep banging my head.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.144
No, don't do that.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.659
I need what's in that head.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.900
Aah.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.958
Special Agent Abigail Borin.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.094
She's 34.

13:38.118 --> 13:41.497
Served a tour of duty
in Iraq as a sergeant.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.300
No spouse. No little Borins.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.868
It's uncanny, isn't it?

13:45.892 --> 13:47.937
What?

13:47.961 --> 13:50.740
A former Marine turned
surly investigative agent

13:50.764 --> 13:52.975
who flies by the seat
of her gut.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.910
How do you know that?

13:54.934 --> 13:58.114
He was eavesdropping
outside the conference room.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.316
It's called research, McTattle.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.319
Anyway, I think a law of
nature's being violated here.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.421
Like matter and antimatter
colliding or something.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.356
That would be bad.
You read comic books.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.191
Are you obsessed with this woman

14:09.215 --> 14:11.027
because she reminds you of Gibbs

14:11.051 --> 14:13.462
or because she is
quite attractive?

14:13.486 --> 14:17.166
Oh, yeah. Gosh,
I hadn't even noticed.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.934
Noticed what?

14:18.958 --> 14:20.536
Oh, hey.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.706
Uh, we're just talking
about the case,

14:23.730 --> 14:24.940
and the complexities

14:24.964 --> 14:27.343
an-and the deeply layered...
Where's Gibbs?

14:27.367 --> 14:31.347
Oh, he's avoiding me,
but I am not going anywhere.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.949
So, what do you got?

14:33.973 --> 14:37.704
"What do you got?" she says.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.657
What we have

14:41.681 --> 14:43.025
is Lieutenant Michael Jensen.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.327
He was in the service 12 years,

14:45.351 --> 14:47.963
last eight as a master diver.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.832
His record was spotless:

14:49.856 --> 14:52.501
Several commendations,
two Purple Hearts.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.304
Video shows him
at the marina with Lyme.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.339
So any other connections?

14:57.363 --> 14:59.809
No, no, nothing
in Jensen's finances.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.111
There was an odd charge, though.

15:02.135 --> 15:05.281
Payment to a storage facility
in Alexandria...

15:05.305 --> 15:07.283
three years, paid in full.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.685
That's a long time to keep
something in a locker, huh?

15:09.709 --> 15:11.939
Unless you want people
to forget about it.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.924
So when can we have access?

15:14.948 --> 15:16.506
We?

15:18.218 --> 15:20.596
Well, first thing
tomorrow morning.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.848
Great.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.771
Is there a problem?

15:28.795 --> 15:30.695
No, it's just...

15:33.666 --> 15:35.644
Do you have any siblings?

15:35.668 --> 15:36.912
None. Only child.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.028
Small town in Ohio.

15:41.074 --> 15:45.010
Tell Gibbs I'll wait for him
outside MTAC.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.726
Nice comm.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.628
Must have set the Navy
back a few bucks.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.431
The Coast Guard does not have
capabilities like this?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.199
We're still capable of plenty.

15:57.223 --> 16:00.703
Just because CGIS is small,
it doesn't mean we're impotent.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.505
Jensen to the boat...
connect 'em.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.374
- Quantico, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.544
- Hi.
- That one of yours?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.045
Outsourced.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.280
Downsizing's rough.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.815
We make it work.

16:12.839 --> 16:16.051
Ms. Choi, could you tell
Special Agent Gibbs

16:16.075 --> 16:18.287
your findings, please?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.356
We dusted Martin Lyme's boat,

16:20.380 --> 16:22.424
and Lieutenant Jensen's prints
were all over it.

16:22.448 --> 16:23.859
Blood?

16:23.883 --> 16:25.861
Some. The type matched
the lieutenant as well.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.130
Still waiting for DNA.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.267
We think you have a double
homicide on your hands:

16:31.291 --> 16:33.802
Captain Lyme
and Lieutenant Jensen.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.405
One civilian, one Navy.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.507
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.776
So, do we keep chasing
each other in circles,

16:40.800 --> 16:42.878
or do we work together
to find a killer?

16:42.902 --> 16:44.513
We have everything
we need right here.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.004
I'm willing to try.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.851
Okay.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.139
Welcome aboard.

16:57.417 --> 17:01.997
Our recon flight spotted Captain
Lyme's vessel the Delilah here.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.499
Boat have a GPS log?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.300
Yeah, which indicated it'd
been trolling back and forth

17:05.324 --> 17:07.469
in a grid pattern
for almost a week.

17:07.492 --> 17:08.704
He was looking for something.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.339
Yeah. It stopped
in this location,

17:10.363 --> 17:12.974
and presumably the murders
took place there.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.510
So, once the killer found
what he was looking for,

17:14.534 --> 17:16.512
he kills Captain Lyme,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.881
tosses Lieutenant Jensen
overboard and abandons ship.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.116
It's miles to shore.
No way he could swim it.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.317
Maybe.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.685
You have satellite photos
of the other ships in the area?

17:24.710 --> 17:25.954
My people are already
working on it.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.189
What about my people?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.158
Oh, yeah.

17:29.182 --> 17:32.895
Uh, yes, we, uh...
tracked several large deposits

17:32.919 --> 17:35.297
recently made
to the captain's bank account.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.866
And we've got a recurring
phone number on Jensen's cell

17:37.890 --> 17:39.668
to a Missy Dawkins
out of Reston.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.003
She's coming in. I'll take it.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.171
And?

17:42.195 --> 17:44.163
And-And I have...

17:46.966 --> 17:49.077
the warrant for the
storage unit Jensen rented.

17:49.101 --> 17:50.679
- Get Ziva to check out.
- Agent Gibbs and I will

17:50.703 --> 17:52.915
- the storage unit...
- take the storage unit.

17:52.939 --> 17:53.916
Sorry. It's your house.

17:53.940 --> 17:54.940
DiNozzo.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.321
Get Ziva,
check out the storage unit.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.823
On it, boss.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.625
Agent Borin, you want to walk me
through your evidence log?

18:03.649 --> 18:04.693
Yeah, no problem.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.261
You can call me Abby.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.164
No, no,
that's not going to happen.

18:09.188 --> 18:12.734
Oh, my God.
I can't believe he's dead.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.371
What was your relationship
with the deceased?

18:16.395 --> 18:19.057
You mean he's deceased, too?

18:21.634 --> 18:22.911
Um, how did you...

18:22.935 --> 18:26.081
how did you know
Lieutenant Jensen?

18:26.105 --> 18:29.651
We dated on and off
for the last six months.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.920
He was a fun guy.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.879
He just didn't have much...

18:35.882 --> 18:36.906
Money.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.897
I was runner-up Miss Biloxi.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.299
I'm accustomed
to a certain lifestyle.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.268
Yeah, I bet you are.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.071
When was the last time
you saw him?

18:49.095 --> 18:51.707
Oh, about two weeks ago.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.710
Michael said he was going off
on some hush-hush Navy thing.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.646
Told me when he came back, he'd
have a lot of money to burn.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.081
Did he say exactly how much?

18:59.105 --> 19:02.597
Enough to make
all my dreams come true.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.455
According to the log,

19:06.479 --> 19:09.691
the last time Jensen accessed
his unit was two weeks ago.

19:09.715 --> 19:10.759
Was he alone?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.394
I couldn't say.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.429
- What do the cameras say?
- Not much.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.231
They haven't worked for years.

19:16.255 --> 19:17.766
Security's pretty tight
around here, huh?

19:17.790 --> 19:20.102
Do I tell you
how to do your job?

19:20.126 --> 19:21.770
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

19:21.794 --> 19:23.605
Act like a jerk?

19:23.629 --> 19:26.608
If I could walk, you know,
I'd kick your Navy ass.

19:26.632 --> 19:30.979
All right,
this is Jensen's unit.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.481
I, uh...

19:32.505 --> 19:34.973
have a bigger unit,
if you'd prefer to see that.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.953
Keys.

19:37.977 --> 19:42.107
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.622
- Smells musty.
- Hmm.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.806
Ah. What do we have here?

19:57.830 --> 19:59.465
Look at all this stuff.

20:02.501 --> 20:05.213
These are ocean charts.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.717
This is where
the Delilah was abandoned.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.886
Calafuego.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.955
Treasure hunters.

20:12.979 --> 20:16.391
Is that what
this is all about... treasure?

20:16.415 --> 20:19.127
Pirate treasure.

20:19.151 --> 20:22.164
Oh, this looks like
David Jones's locker.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.966
Davy Jones.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.168
He used to sing
with The Monkees.

20:26.192 --> 20:29.338
Real monkeys?

20:29.362 --> 20:32.092
I envy your brain sometimes.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.413
Hey, Abby.

20:38.437 --> 20:39.915
Hey.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.917
Gold reales
and a sunken treasure, Gibbs.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.986
All taken
from Jensen's storage locker.

20:44.010 --> 20:44.987
Pretty cool.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.122
Almost makes up
for the way I feel.

20:47.146 --> 20:50.125
Although I hear you're having
your own personal problems...

20:50.149 --> 20:53.209
Special Agent Abigail Borin.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.112
- Abby.
- Abby.

20:57.323 --> 21:00.884
So, Abby, what do you got?

21:02.028 --> 21:03.905
What do you got, Abbs?

21:03.929 --> 21:07.376
Other than like
a five-alarm migraine...

21:07.400 --> 21:09.878
I was finally able
to decrypt Jensen's laptop.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.547
The most interesting thing
on here is a nested folder

21:12.571 --> 21:14.116
containing e-mails
between Jensen

21:14.140 --> 21:16.151
and a Dr. Joseph Mavrey.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.120
He's a big surgeon in DC.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.655
What were they about?

21:19.679 --> 21:21.723
At first glance, it seems like
they're talking about sports,

21:21.747 --> 21:24.459
'cause they keep using
the term "a cage foul."

21:24.483 --> 21:26.519
But that is an anagram for...

21:28.120 --> 21:29.631
Calafuego.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.266
It's the ship
Jensen was researching.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.501
Maybe it's a coincidence.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.802
Don't believe in them.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.237
Of course not.

21:35.261 --> 21:36.805
Okay, so according
to the history books,

21:36.829 --> 21:38.473
the Calafuego went down
off the East Coast.

21:38.497 --> 21:39.808
Maybe Jensen was looking for it.

21:39.832 --> 21:40.909
Or found it.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.210
Maybe he had a partner.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.780
- It costs a lot to recover a ship.
- Mm.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.815
They'd have to be rich.

21:46.839 --> 21:47.949
Very.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.531
Thanks, Abbs.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.226
Are you sure I can't
get you anything?

21:58.250 --> 22:00.195
Yeah, I'm sure.

22:00.219 --> 22:03.432
Mrs. Mavrey, we actually need
to speak with your husband.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.400
I'm afraid that's impossible.
He's out of the country.

22:05.424 --> 22:08.103
Another International Doctor's
Group crisis in South America.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.938
He won't be back for weeks.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.339
Is there any way
that we can reach him?

22:11.363 --> 22:14.876
No. Joe turns everything off
when he travels.

22:14.900 --> 22:17.679
He says it distracts him
from the work.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.614
Does the name Michael Jensen
ring a bell?

22:19.638 --> 22:22.484
Is he a patient of my husband's?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.237
No. He's a Navy diver.

22:25.377 --> 22:26.822
He's dead.

22:26.846 --> 22:30.859
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.428
Apparently, you husband
Dr. Mavrey contacted him

22:33.452 --> 22:35.130
multiple times.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.365
Look, because of the success

22:37.389 --> 22:40.502
of Joe's work, he is
constantly meeting new people.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.672
There's no way I could possibly
keep track of them all.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.774
When he checks in,
I'll be happy to mention it.

22:45.798 --> 22:47.109
But then it might be too late.

22:47.133 --> 22:51.012
When you do hear from him,
if you could let us know,

22:51.036 --> 22:54.733
- we'd appreciate it.
- I will, absolutely.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.554
- She's covering for her husband.
- Maybe.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.556
Gibbs, we should bring her in
for questioning.

23:01.580 --> 23:02.724
Push her harder.

23:02.748 --> 23:03.825
Based on what?

23:03.849 --> 23:05.694
Based on... my gut.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.829
Right, right, yeah,
I've heard that before.

23:07.853 --> 23:09.765
So what, we're just supposed
to sit around and wait?

23:09.789 --> 23:10.799
Yeah, for now.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.135
Is that the Navy way?

23:13.159 --> 23:14.870
No, it's the smart way.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.706
SECNAV has pull with
the attorney general.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.243
Doctors' charity...
AG's on the board.

23:21.267 --> 23:22.711
So we'll get him.

23:22.735 --> 23:23.895
I know that.

23:27.006 --> 23:30.051
Look at all
these swashbuckling movies.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.420
And Errol Flynn.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.089
Captain Blood!

23:34.113 --> 23:37.058
And Douglas Fairbanks.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.494
Huh? The Black Pirate.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.530
Imagine Gibbs as a pirate?

23:41.554 --> 23:44.032
A little eye patch
and the peg leg?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.867
A parrot on his shoulder?

23:45.891 --> 23:47.602
We are not talking about
pirate movies. Look at this.

23:47.626 --> 23:50.605
Mel Fisher found
the Atocha in 1985.

23:50.629 --> 23:52.174
Made almost 450 million bucks.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.775
The real Calafuego went down

23:53.799 --> 23:57.546
in 1647, loaded with gifts
for the Spanish government.

23:57.570 --> 24:00.048
So, if this really turns out
to be the Calafuego,

24:00.072 --> 24:01.850
no telling how much
money's at stake here.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.118
Give me a ballpark, McGee.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.253
$250 million easy, boss.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.422
Jensen must have isolated
the wreck site

24:07.446 --> 24:10.425
and went looking for a backer
to fund the recovery mission.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.793
- Why Mavrey?
- Oh, 'cause he was more

24:11.817 --> 24:12.961
than just a good heart surgeon.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.130
He had 16 patents pending.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.232
So he could afford
to play treasure hunter.

24:17.256 --> 24:20.569
So Mavrey killed him
to avoid splitting the loot.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.971
It's very Treasure
of the Sierra Madre.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.307
So Mavrey doesn't need
the money, though.

24:25.331 --> 24:26.908
Ooh, no, actually he does.

24:26.932 --> 24:30.412
Apparently, one
of the stents is flawed.

24:30.436 --> 24:32.480
Thousands of lawsuits
flying around now,

24:32.504 --> 24:34.449
so he's going to need
as many high-priced lawyers

24:34.473 --> 24:35.450
as he can afford.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.485
Gibbs.

24:37.509 --> 24:39.087
Just got a call from the
attorney general's office.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.256
Mavrey's doctor group
never left the country.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.907
He's been here all along.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.827
- BOLO, McGee. Find him.
- Already on it.

24:45.851 --> 24:49.531
Okay, Dr. Mavrey just logged in
to his own Web site

24:49.555 --> 24:52.167
to perform a bypass surgery.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.902
Look, you can watch it live

24:53.926 --> 24:55.804
if you click here
and pay $19.99.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.672
Where is he?

24:57.696 --> 24:58.874
His own facility...
Northwest DC.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.209
That's 1200 Meadowlark Ave,
boss.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.578
Click there. Click it.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.146
Hell of a place to hide.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.149
His own clinic...
not real bright.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.851
Dr. Mavrey... where is he?

25:09.875 --> 25:11.686
I'm sorry.
I'm not at liberty to say.

25:11.710 --> 25:12.888
Dr. Mavrey's gone.
He won't be back...

25:12.912 --> 25:14.990
We know he just signed in
to online surgery.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.558
We need to see him.
We're federal agents.

25:16.582 --> 25:17.759
I'm telling you he isn't here.

25:17.783 --> 25:18.994
He hasn't been for days.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.195
They're getting ready
for surgery.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.811
You can't go in there.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.202
Dr. Mavrey, we need to talk.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.670
What is this?

25:28.694 --> 25:30.038
Who are you?

25:30.062 --> 25:31.606
Victor Kalsa.
I'm Dr. Mavrey's associate.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.675
I fill in for him
when he isn't available.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.477
We're about to start
a surgery here.

25:35.501 --> 25:36.711
I know that. Where's Mavrey?

25:36.735 --> 25:37.979
Well, to be honest,

25:38.003 --> 25:39.732
we haven't heard
from him in over a week.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.060
Okay,

25:52.084 --> 25:53.528
this is what I'm talking about.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.663
Second one down.

25:54.687 --> 25:55.897
Was he there?

25:55.921 --> 25:57.565
No, not exactly.

25:57.589 --> 26:01.336
Dr. Mavrey has his partners
do his online surgeries for him.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.872
Well, a flag just went up on one
of Mavrey's credit cards here.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.640
Hired a private jet
earlier today

26:05.664 --> 26:07.542
to fly him
to the Mariana Islands.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.511
The Marianas?

26:09.535 --> 26:11.746
- Where is that exactly?
- Guam. U.S. Commonwealth.

26:11.770 --> 26:12.781
Now it's my turn.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.050
- Omagi.
- Talk to me, boss.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.818
If the doctor's plane
hasn't landed yet,

26:16.842 --> 26:19.220
why don't we have a Coast Guard
aircraft intercept it

26:19.244 --> 26:22.691
and suggest to his pilots
they may be abetting a fugitive.

26:22.715 --> 26:23.841
On it.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.028
Nice. You can do that?

26:27.052 --> 26:28.220
Just scratching the surface.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.299
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- Can I see you?

26:31.323 --> 26:33.188
Yeah, yeah, Duck, on my way.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.173
Oh, you're alone.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.342
Who were you expecting?

26:40.366 --> 26:42.277
Her, of course.

26:42.301 --> 26:46.247
The whole building is talking
about your Coast Guard friend.

26:46.271 --> 26:49.851
I'm feeling particularly alone
and depressed tonight.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.120
First, Mother moves
into the next world,

26:52.144 --> 26:54.055
and then last night...

26:54.079 --> 26:56.091
You broke up with Sophie?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.826
You noticed. Hmm.

26:57.850 --> 27:01.830
She was so anxious to change
yours truly.

27:01.854 --> 27:04.532
I was beginning to question
my own identity.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.401
Yeah, I know how protective
you are of that.

27:06.425 --> 27:10.972
She also put some of Mother's
silver in the dishwasher.

27:10.996 --> 27:13.499
Really?

27:16.402 --> 27:17.846
Hey, Duck...

27:17.870 --> 27:19.714
Did you call me down here

27:19.738 --> 27:21.349
to tell me something?

27:21.373 --> 27:22.917
Oh, yeah.

27:22.941 --> 27:28.757
Jensen's medical records
are on the way over.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.226
But in preparing this mold,

27:31.250 --> 27:33.461
I made an interesting discovery.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.397
Well, the guy had an overbite.

27:35.421 --> 27:40.535
Yes, but he also has
several sub-fractures

27:40.559 --> 27:42.370
on three incisors.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.172
Broken teeth from struggling?

27:44.196 --> 27:45.740
No, I don't think so.

27:45.764 --> 27:49.310
I think they were self-inflicted
from some kind of seizure.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.801
I mean, take a look.

27:52.905 --> 27:56.284
The jaw was clamped
so tightly shut

27:56.308 --> 28:00.488
that he quite literally
detached the masseter muscle

28:00.512 --> 28:02.557
from the mandible bone.

28:02.581 --> 28:04.559
Bit right through
the mouthpiece.

28:04.583 --> 28:07.729
Which explains the pieces
of rubber we found in his mouth.

28:07.753 --> 28:10.799
I mean, in a dazed panic
and unable to breathe,

28:10.823 --> 28:12.967
he rips off his mask and drowns.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.469
Duck, why would a guy
who's been diving

28:14.493 --> 28:15.737
his whole life react like that?

28:15.761 --> 28:18.373
I also...

28:18.397 --> 28:21.676
found a history
of hemochromatosis;

28:21.700 --> 28:23.945
In his case, congenital.

28:23.969 --> 28:26.648
It's a retention of iron,
to be precise.

28:26.672 --> 28:29.451
I believe that this condition

28:29.475 --> 28:31.319
would have precluded
diver training,

28:31.343 --> 28:34.856
unless, of course,
someone expunged his records.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.758
Unbelievable.

28:36.782 --> 28:39.694
I don't know how they think
they can get away with this.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.062
Who's they?

28:41.086 --> 28:42.630
They, you know,
the ubiquitous "them."

28:42.654 --> 28:44.866
You found something
in Jensen's blood?

28:44.890 --> 28:46.768
What? Oh, no.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.470
Um, that's not Jensen's blood.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.738
That's the spectrographic
analysis of Caf-POW!

28:50.762 --> 28:52.207
Or so they'd like you to think.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.675
They changed the formula, Gibbs.

28:53.699 --> 28:56.377
And not to improve the flavor,
but to save money.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.413
I mean, no wonder
I've been a total freak.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.415
This is like New Coke
all over again.

29:00.439 --> 29:01.883
I'm going to start
a letter-writing campaign.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.118
Do you want to help me?

29:03.142 --> 29:04.486
Abby, you've got
nothing on Jensen?

29:04.510 --> 29:08.056
Actually, when Ducky said
that Jensen had a seizure...

29:08.080 --> 29:09.991
I reran his blood

29:10.015 --> 29:11.659
and I found exactly
what I found before,

29:11.683 --> 29:12.861
which was nothing.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.496
Jensen was using nitrox

29:14.520 --> 29:16.598
because, on deep dives,
it's beneficial.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.133
But he was headed
into shallow water,

29:18.157 --> 29:19.834
so why didn't he adjust?

29:19.858 --> 29:21.569
A master diver would know that.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.753
That's why I think there's
something rotten in Denmark.

29:24.796 --> 29:26.508
Hang on a sec, Gibbs.

29:26.532 --> 29:30.778
I might have something
sooner than later.

29:30.802 --> 29:33.314
Boss, fishermen just found
a punctured Zodiac

29:33.338 --> 29:35.517
floating not too far from
where Jensen's body washed up.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.352
- It's how they got back.
- Had to be.

29:37.376 --> 29:41.222
Coast Guard
intercepted Mavrey's plane.

29:41.246 --> 29:42.724
He wasn't on it.

29:42.748 --> 29:45.527
Pilots were paid cash to fly
an empty plane to the Marianas.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.629
- Empty?
- No, decoy.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.030
We're being played.

29:49.054 --> 29:50.331
Where's DiNozzo?

29:50.355 --> 29:53.347
Need him to bring in
that doctor's wife.

29:55.260 --> 29:58.106
Oh, hi.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.642
Wow, nice pad.

30:00.666 --> 30:03.111
Early American colossal.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.513
Hello.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.515
You must be Agent DiNozzo.

30:07.539 --> 30:08.983
Mrs. Mavrey?

30:09.007 --> 30:10.852
Impressive.

30:10.876 --> 30:13.655
I got your message.

30:13.679 --> 30:15.924
What's this about Joe
chartering a plane?

30:15.948 --> 30:17.358
I don't understand.

30:17.382 --> 30:20.762
Yeah, yeah, one-way.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.764
Usually not a good indication.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.299
We have a few questions.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.500
Of course.

30:25.524 --> 30:26.734
So do I.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.670
We need your help
in finding him.

30:28.694 --> 30:32.373
If I knew anything,
I would tell you.

30:32.397 --> 30:36.424
Please, I will help you
in any way I can.

30:38.136 --> 30:41.983
Uh-oh, that's not good.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.444
Doc's having some
legal trouble, huh?

30:47.346 --> 30:48.790
Yeah.

30:48.814 --> 30:51.593
We... We've had
a rough time lately.

30:51.617 --> 30:54.362
Joe's been upset,

30:54.386 --> 30:55.964
distracted.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.932
But I never expected him to...

30:57.956 --> 31:01.970
If you lie to us,
you're aiding a fugitive.

31:01.994 --> 31:05.225
I keep telling you,
I don't know where he is.

31:07.532 --> 31:12.480
Look, um, I got this e-mail
over a week ago.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.782
Joe said that he was
leaving the country...

31:14.806 --> 31:16.784
for work,

31:16.808 --> 31:19.954
and that the lawsuits would be
dealt with when he got back,

31:19.978 --> 31:23.258
that things would be better
for us.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.593
Joe's a good husband

31:25.617 --> 31:28.463
and a dedicated doctor.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.012
And I love him.

31:33.992 --> 31:35.789
Even if he murdered two people?

31:37.863 --> 31:40.141
That's not possible.

31:40.165 --> 31:42.910
Joe could never do that.

31:42.934 --> 31:46.165
Okay, let's look
at a few pictures.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.351
Lieutenant Michael Jensen,
U.S. Navy diver.

31:50.375 --> 31:51.953
Dead.

31:51.977 --> 31:57.325
Martin Lyme,
captain of a salvage ship.

31:57.349 --> 32:00.662
Civilian. He's also dead.

32:00.686 --> 32:04.499
As you can see, Andrea...
he's not only capable,

32:04.523 --> 32:06.768
he's actually quite good
at killing.

32:06.792 --> 32:09.604
Now, we need you
to help us find him,

32:09.628 --> 32:12.324
or we're going to have
to charge you as an accessory.

32:16.802 --> 32:21.136
I didn't do anything wrong.

32:24.142 --> 32:28.189
Why is this happening?

32:28.213 --> 32:31.859
Lieutenant Jensen's
medical records arrived.

32:31.883 --> 32:34.829
As expected, the Navy
has no indication

32:34.853 --> 32:36.764
of any liver condition.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.466
Records could have
been falsified.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.501
Yes, sometimes,
the desire to serve

32:40.525 --> 32:42.103
can override better judgment.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.439
Right. But you don't
think that happened.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.473
No.

32:45.497 --> 32:48.543
No, I spoke
to the staff physician

32:48.567 --> 32:50.345
at the Experimental Diving Unit.

32:50.369 --> 32:53.981
He examined Jensen
dozens of times over the years.

32:54.005 --> 32:57.819
And he saw absolutely
no indicators whatsoever

32:57.843 --> 32:59.687
of hemochromatosis,

32:59.711 --> 33:00.855
whereas...

33:00.879 --> 33:05.259
this gentleman...

33:05.283 --> 33:07.119
shows absolutely every sign.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.299
So this isn't Jensen.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.450
I'm afraid not.

33:23.201 --> 33:27.014
If this isn't Lieutenant Jensen,
who's in Autopsy?

33:27.038 --> 33:28.482
First question.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.217
And the second?

33:30.241 --> 33:31.685
Where is Lieutenant Jensen?

33:31.709 --> 33:33.754
Got a BOLO out.

33:33.778 --> 33:36.924
He's got a pretty good
head start on us, though.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.726
Abby finished running
the John Doe's DNA.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.445
- Any hits?
- Any hits?

33:41.619 --> 33:44.231
No, and without a name
to compare it to,

33:44.255 --> 33:46.300
- Ducky's dental mold is useless.
- Find Jensen.

33:46.324 --> 33:48.102
We gotta I.D. that body.

33:48.126 --> 33:50.404
DiNozzo, talk to Metro.

33:50.428 --> 33:51.839
Get a list of missing persons.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.607
Getting a list
of missing persons, boss.

33:53.631 --> 33:55.142
Time to call the FBI.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.812
Ziva, security footage
at the marina.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.613
- I.D. everybody there.
- Uh-huh.

33:59.637 --> 34:02.650
McGee, Mavrey's personal
medical records... pull them all.

34:02.674 --> 34:03.818
Got it, boss.

34:03.842 --> 34:04.934
Medical records?

34:07.478 --> 34:08.856
All right, nothing too exciting.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.224
Elevated blood sugar level.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.693
Got good cholesterol.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.329
Look at this.
Something interesting here.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.563
He had epileptic seizures

34:16.588 --> 34:18.954
as a boy and has
a congenital liver disorder.

34:38.810 --> 34:39.887
You found my husband.

34:39.911 --> 34:43.056
Where is he at?
I need to see him.

34:43.081 --> 34:47.862
Um... well, he's, uh,
he's here, Andrea.

34:47.886 --> 34:50.898
He's...

34:50.922 --> 34:53.152
He's been here all along.

34:54.192 --> 34:56.971
I don't understand.

34:56.995 --> 35:00.158
The dead body in the wet suit
wasn't Jensen.

35:01.499 --> 35:04.044
I'm very sorry.

35:04.068 --> 35:05.412
No.

35:05.436 --> 35:08.616
No...

35:08.640 --> 35:11.385
No, that's not possible.

35:11.409 --> 35:14.088
The e-mail that he sent me.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.625
Anyone could have
accessed his e-mail.

35:17.649 --> 35:20.027
Who?

35:20.051 --> 35:22.849
We're working on that.

35:24.489 --> 35:26.000
The diving,

35:26.024 --> 35:27.134
the treasure-hunting,

35:27.158 --> 35:28.535
that's just supposed
to be a hobby,

35:28.559 --> 35:31.505
and now you're telling me
he's dead because of it?

35:31.529 --> 35:32.928
Let us help you.

35:35.934 --> 35:38.869
Is there anything
you haven't told us?

35:45.710 --> 35:53.327
Because of the... the lawsuits,
Joe started...

35:53.351 --> 35:56.184
taking money
out of his corporate accounts.

35:57.288 --> 35:58.516
Cash.

35:59.857 --> 36:01.368
A lot of it.

36:01.392 --> 36:04.505
I think that, um,

36:04.529 --> 36:07.408
I think that he
was putting it all

36:07.432 --> 36:09.195
into some ridiculous
treasure hunt.

36:10.702 --> 36:15.716
Hoping that whatever he found
would pay for it all.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.139
Well, that's risky.

36:19.477 --> 36:21.843
Yeah, well, Joe was desperate.

36:28.119 --> 36:32.066
So Mavrey finances the recovery
of the Calafuego,

36:32.090 --> 36:34.134
hires a boat and pays Jensen
to recover the gold.

36:34.158 --> 36:35.402
$200 million.

36:35.426 --> 36:37.004
While Jensen fakes
his own death, kills them,

36:37.028 --> 36:38.205
and keeps all the treasure.

36:38.229 --> 36:39.840
It is like The Sierra Madre.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.075
Yeah, but who's Bogie?

36:41.099 --> 36:42.977
Boss, boss, uh, Miss Biloxi,

36:43.001 --> 36:44.812
- Missy Dawkins...
- Yeah?

36:44.836 --> 36:47.581
She just bought
two one-way tickets to Mexico.

36:47.605 --> 36:50.039
The first is in her name;
The second is Michael Jensen.

36:52.977 --> 36:56.123
- Am I in trouble?
- Depends.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.291
On?

36:57.315 --> 36:58.726
On whether you cooperate.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.661
Why don't you tell us
where you were supposed

37:00.685 --> 37:02.262
to meet Michael Jensen.

37:02.286 --> 37:04.413
I can't do that.

37:05.156 --> 37:06.467
I mean...

37:06.491 --> 37:08.235
I wasn't supposed to meet him.

37:08.259 --> 37:09.749
He said he'd come to me.

37:10.661 --> 37:12.072
You spoke to him?

37:12.096 --> 37:13.073
We text.

37:13.097 --> 37:15.275
He said his ship had come in,

37:15.299 --> 37:18.312
and I was supposed to buy two
tickets to Mexico, get packed,

37:18.336 --> 37:19.980
and be ready to go, but...

37:20.004 --> 37:22.029
He never showed.

37:25.276 --> 37:27.421
I knew it was too good
to be true.

37:27.445 --> 37:30.724
He was using me, huh?

37:30.748 --> 37:32.292
You're another decoy.

37:32.316 --> 37:35.911
You buy the ticket,
we chase you, buys Jensen time.

37:38.189 --> 37:40.834
I should have known
this was never going to work.

37:40.858 --> 37:43.303
It's not like we really
had anything in common.

37:43.327 --> 37:46.507
I mean, besides,
he spent all his time

37:46.531 --> 37:49.830
with that rich doctor
and his wife.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.786
Yeah. Gibbs.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.120
- Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs.
- Abbs.

38:00.144 --> 38:01.655
- I've got something.
- Abbs, I can't hear you.

38:01.679 --> 38:02.756
- What? What?
- What's all the noise?

38:02.780 --> 38:04.082
The noise!

38:05.883 --> 38:06.894
What do you got, Abbs?

38:06.918 --> 38:08.162
Good news, Gibbs.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.164
They decided to stick
with the original formula.

38:10.188 --> 38:13.167
So everything in my Caf-POW!
Universe is okay again.

38:13.191 --> 38:14.522
Congratulations. Anything else?

38:15.560 --> 38:17.571
Okay, so I got to thinking.

38:17.595 --> 38:20.507
Why keep a bunch
of museum-quality Spanish coins

38:20.531 --> 38:23.110
in a storage unit that has
no security? Stupid, right?

38:23.134 --> 38:25.012
Unless they're not
museum-quality.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.513
Is that what you're tumbling?

38:26.537 --> 38:30.350
Okay, in theory, we have
$250,000 worth of gold reales.

38:30.374 --> 38:31.432
But look at this.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.057
I added simple boric acid.

38:37.081 --> 38:39.326
It ate away the gold plating.

38:39.350 --> 38:41.395
Not real.

38:41.419 --> 38:44.331
All of this stuff
from Jensen's storage unit,

38:44.355 --> 38:46.100
it's worthless.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.569
Jensen's been
scamming everybody.

38:48.593 --> 38:50.437
There's no Calafuego treasure.

38:50.461 --> 38:52.372
He has been conning
Dr. Mavrey for months,

38:52.396 --> 38:53.807
bilking him dry.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.043
He took advantage
of a desperate man.

38:56.067 --> 38:59.313
So, then what was still
worth killing for?

38:59.337 --> 39:00.781
A different kind of treasure.

39:00.805 --> 39:03.137
Thanks, Abbs.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.956
- Andrea Mavrey said she never met Jensen.
- She was lying.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.891
Jensen got into it
to con the doctor,

39:10.915 --> 39:12.359
but it turned into
something else...

39:12.383 --> 39:13.927
something with Mrs. Mavrey.

39:13.951 --> 39:17.464
The real treasure's the millions
Mavrey took out of the bank.

39:17.488 --> 39:20.000
Wait a minute. You're saying
the widow and the stud diver...

39:20.024 --> 39:21.034
they-they did it together?

39:21.058 --> 39:22.536
Ziva, did you hear that?

39:22.560 --> 39:24.605
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

39:24.629 --> 39:25.839
Yes, I heard
the wife did it, Tony.

39:25.863 --> 39:26.940
Okay, yes, you are a genius.

39:26.964 --> 39:28.408
Okay, question.

39:28.432 --> 39:30.177
Where would you hide
a lot of money if you

39:30.201 --> 39:31.411
were afraid your house
could be seized?

39:31.435 --> 39:32.746
Not in my house.

39:32.770 --> 39:34.615
DiNozzo, get over
to the clinic... sweep it.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.368
- Meet you at Mavrey's.
- On it, boss.

39:40.077 --> 39:41.421
Look, Michael,

39:41.445 --> 39:44.892
the money's not in the safe
or any of the cabinets.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.594
Andrea, it is not that easy
to hide $10 million.

39:47.618 --> 39:49.396
We've gone through
the whole house.

39:49.420 --> 39:51.031
- Think.
- I am.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.499
Well, we're running out of time.

39:52.523 --> 39:54.034
You guys looking for something?

39:54.058 --> 39:55.636
Who the hell are you?

39:55.660 --> 39:56.904
Came to see the grieving widow.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.939
Guess she's not grieving
anymore, huh?

39:58.963 --> 40:02.242
Well, Jensen,
I knew a Navy diver

40:02.266 --> 40:03.677
was too smart to drown.

40:03.701 --> 40:06.813
Yeah. You almost had us.

40:06.837 --> 40:09.416
Body Heat.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.051
William Hurt, Kathleen Turner.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.953
Hire the stud
to kill the husband.

40:12.977 --> 40:14.808
Didn't really work out
so well, did it?

40:16.180 --> 40:17.291
So, guys, where's the money?

40:17.315 --> 40:18.559
I don't know.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.960
We do.

40:19.984 --> 40:23.630
It is amazing the things people
keep in their work lockers.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.399
Me, it's just dirty socks

40:25.423 --> 40:27.968
and a Live Aid T-shirt.
Geldof signed it.

40:27.992 --> 40:29.687
Mavrey's locker.

40:30.995 --> 40:31.972
Yo-ho-ho.

40:31.996 --> 40:35.342
Did you really think
that Jensen there

40:35.366 --> 40:38.745
was going to take you with him?

40:38.769 --> 40:41.014
He planned the whole thing.

40:41.038 --> 40:43.150
He forced me.
He said he'd kill me if...

40:43.174 --> 40:44.818
if I didn't go along.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.820
- She's lying.
- You are under arrest for the murders

40:46.844 --> 40:49.356
of Joseph Mavrey
and Martin Lyme.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.558
It's time to walk
the plank, matey.

40:51.582 --> 40:52.981
Arrgh.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.297
Agent Borin, I wanted
to thank you personally

40:57.321 --> 40:59.499
for working so proficiently
with NCIS.

40:59.523 --> 41:02.151
Thank you, Director.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.105
Agent Gibbs?

41:05.129 --> 41:06.974
Yeah.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.243
Thanks.

41:09.267 --> 41:12.279
I just got off the phone
with SECNAV.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.314
Now I know turf wars
are unavoidable,

41:14.338 --> 41:18.085
but I find that cooperating
with our sister agencies

41:18.109 --> 41:20.187
provides excellent results.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.456
Don't you agree, Agent Gibbs?

41:22.480 --> 41:24.914
Yeah, sure.

41:27.251 --> 41:29.730
Well, hopefully,
we can do it again soon.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.346
Anytime.

41:32.890 --> 41:35.950
You know where to find me.

41:38.129 --> 41:41.708
Likewise.

41:41.732 --> 41:45.679
Are you ready for
the adventure of a lifetime?

41:45.703 --> 41:48.782
It is just a movie, Tony.

41:48.806 --> 41:51.151
How dare you.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.420
Is Mickey just a mouse?

41:53.444 --> 41:55.355
Ringling Brothers just a circus?

41:55.379 --> 41:57.591
Yes.

41:57.615 --> 42:01.395
Well, you see, that's why
you don't have any friends.

42:01.419 --> 42:02.829
I do have friends.

42:02.853 --> 42:07.134
Really, then,
what are you doing with me,

42:07.158 --> 42:10.404
watching a movie on
a Friday night at work, huh?

42:10.428 --> 42:12.828
You are my friend.

42:14.332 --> 42:15.629
Really?

42:18.069 --> 42:19.229
No.

42:21.939 --> 42:23.668
My date canceled.

42:25.476 --> 42:26.811
Mine, too.
