00:03.087 --> 00:04.046
Gun, gun, gun!

00:05.881 --> 00:08.676
Rose and Associates have begun
the process of filing a civil suit

00:08.759 --> 00:12.012
against the city of Los Angeles
and the LAPD

00:12.096 --> 00:14.724
on behalf of Nicole's son, Kalon.

00:14.807 --> 00:18.144
I was able to identify the SIS Lieutenant.
Spencer Cosgrove.

00:18.227 --> 00:21.147
Chandler will distort the truth.
She'll inflame public opinion.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.523
Well, it won't be hard.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.942
The whole department
will be under siege.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.485
We need to stick together on this.

00:26.569 --> 00:29.947
[Golliher] Dr. Basu had five stab wounds,
all to vital blood vessels.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.532
The killer knew what he was doing.

00:31.615 --> 00:35.453
I'd wager the assailant has
some military or medical background.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.370
Can you describe him?

00:36.454 --> 00:37.997
He was wearing a mask.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.708
One of those
Mexican wrestling masks.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.294
We're not detectives
and we sure as shit aren't social workers.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.962

00:45.129 --> 00:46.589
What happened with that Thai Town call?

00:46.672 --> 00:48.215
Attempted rape. Suspect fled.

00:48.299 --> 00:49.216
She get a good look at him?

00:49.300 --> 00:50.718
Wearing a luchador mask.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.219
Red and black?

00:52.303 --> 00:54.638
[Bosch]
Any update on Vance's probate?

00:54.722 --> 00:57.516
It's still uncontested.
We need to confirm Vance's heir.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.228
If it stays uncontested, all shares
and interest will pass to the board.

01:01.312 --> 01:04.190
My client was the biological father
of Dominick Santanello.

01:04.273 --> 01:05.107
Your grandfather.

01:05.191 --> 01:07.818
You should know
his estate goes to his heirs.

01:07.902 --> 01:08.736
You and your son.

01:09.862 --> 01:12.448
If DNA confirms bloodlines,
which it will.

01:12.531 --> 01:13.783
So how much?

01:13.866 --> 01:14.867
Billions.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.703
Better guard those with your life.

01:17.787 --> 01:19.705
Oh, I'm gonna take them straight there.

01:19.789 --> 01:22.374
BioRight Testing's good, reliable.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.501
Better be.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.795
We need to do something
about this DNA situation.

01:25.878 --> 01:28.756
We need to strangle
the baby in the crib, so to speak.

01:31.342 --> 01:34.303
Mr. Creighton, I understand
you have work for me.

Mr. Bosch.
Where did you come from?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.934
Parked around the corner.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.271
What brings you here?

05:12.354 --> 05:14.690
The envelope you sent me.

05:14.773 --> 05:18.235
Maybe we should go inside.
You never know who's watching.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.361
No, you don't.

05:19.445 --> 05:20.446
Please.

05:24.033 --> 05:28.370
I went to the post office and sent
the envelope to you by regular mail,

05:28.454 --> 05:30.581
as Mr. Vance instructed.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.583
Did you know what was in the envelope?

05:32.666 --> 05:33.500
I did not.

05:35.002 --> 05:39.465
You'd sign an affidavit to that effect?

05:39.548 --> 05:42.092
What's this all about?

05:42.176 --> 05:45.345
It's about establishing
the chain of authenticity.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.305
Which means?

05:46.388 --> 05:49.475
Ensures the contents
of the envelope are genuine.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.269
And what were the contents?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.147
A handwritten will
and Mr. Vance's gold fountain pen.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.275
[sighs] Oh, my goodness.

06:00.027 --> 06:00.986
So...

06:02.821 --> 06:03.697
What happens now?

06:03.781 --> 06:04.656
Probate.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.576
They'll compare the will with
other handwriting samples of Mr. Vance.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.120
They'll analyze the ink
and pen and paper.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.999
As a secretary,
I could help you, but I've been sacked.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.084
I'm sorry to hear that.

Showed up on my doorstep
and handed me my walking papers.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.757
After 40 years. Quite a shock.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.761
-Who, Sloan?
-No. Mr. Corwin. From the board.

06:26.929 --> 06:30.224
He's running things now.
I suppose he's the executor.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.683
I am.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.143
You are what?

06:33.227 --> 06:35.145
I'm the executor of the Vance estate.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.733
I know Mr. Vance was grateful to you
for finding his son.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.568
He told you about that?

06:41.652 --> 06:43.320
Yes, he did, but that's ridiculous.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.738
I agree.

06:44.822 --> 06:47.741
What do you know about wills
and estates and probate and all?

06:47.825 --> 06:50.494
Absolutely nothing.
I'll need some legal advice.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.373
Poor Mr. Vance wasn't in his right mind.

06:54.456 --> 06:57.042
Yeah, I wouldn't bang that drum too hard.

06:57.126 --> 06:58.544
Why not?

06:58.627 --> 07:00.712
He left you $10 million.

[gasps]

07:02.464 --> 07:03.465

07:04.466 --> 07:06.218
I think you should consider
hiring an attorney.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.344
Why would I do that?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.888
When this new will gets filed
with the probate court,

07:09.972 --> 07:11.682
things are gonna get nasty.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.684
You should protect yourself.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.185
I don't know any lawyers.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.353
Well, I can recommend one.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.856
And you never answered me
about the affidavit.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.524
Oh, of course I'll sign it.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.443
Okay, I'll write it up today and bring it
by tomorrow and you can sign it.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.361
That'd be okay?

07:24.444 --> 07:25.612
Yes, that's fine.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.575
I hope you don't mind going out the back.
You can't be too careful.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.410
No, you can't.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.911
I'll see you tomorrow.

07:33.704 --> 07:37.249
Key questions.
Which officer shouted "gun"?

07:37.332 --> 07:39.001
And did he really see the gun?

07:40.043 --> 07:42.713
Did Sharp make a move for it?

07:42.796 --> 07:47.134
Did SIS give him time
to comply before they opened fire?

07:47.217 --> 07:49.845
When can we get body cam footage?

07:49.928 --> 07:52.556
We'll have to see
how cooperative LAPD is.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.057
Wouldn't hold my breath.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.810
They have up to 45 days
to release that footage,

07:56.894 --> 07:59.104
plus their own internal investigation
to complete.

07:59.188 --> 08:02.107
Maybe we can generate
some public pressure on the police

08:02.191 --> 08:03.400
to release what they have now.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.402
Well, it's worth a try.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.528
Social media?

08:06.612 --> 08:10.157
All over it. Smartphone footage,
Ring footage--

08:10.240 --> 08:11.617
a million little pieces.

08:11.700 --> 08:16.079
Now, the thing is, it's like
a football replay of a goal line stand.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.958
No definitive angles?
Ruling on the field stands.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.670
I think I get that analogy.
[clears throat]

08:23.754 --> 08:24.713
And what about Cosgrove?

08:24.796 --> 08:28.842
I have a meeting later with an attorney
who sued SIS and the city.

08:28.926 --> 08:32.012
I'm hoping she can shed
some light on Lieutenant Cosgrove.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.055
The most recent incident,

08:33.138 --> 08:35.474
there were reports of a man
running from the scene

08:35.557 --> 08:39.269
wearing a black and red
Mexican wrestling mask.

08:39.353 --> 08:40.646
Luchador.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.774
[Coleman] Thank you, Officer.
A luchador mask and black gloves.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.400
Based on those initial sightings,

08:45.484 --> 08:47.945
we set up a perimeter
and conducted a thorough search--

08:48.028 --> 08:49.488
Which came up empty.

08:49.571 --> 08:53.784
So long story short,
we're gonna expand the perimeter

08:53.867 --> 08:55.285
and recanvass the neighborhood.

08:56.286 --> 08:59.373
Lieutenant, what are the chances
those items are still around?

08:59.498 --> 09:02.417
Thank you, Officer Vasquez,
for volunteering to take point.

09:02.501 --> 09:03.752
Sir?

09:03.835 --> 09:06.755
I'm putting you in charge.
You can take your boot with you.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.133
Yes.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.805
You see any strange cars? Anyone around
the neighborhood you've never seen before?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.890
Sorry. Nothing comes to mind.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.434
We accounted
all the visible cameras in the area,

09:19.518 --> 09:21.228
but do you maybe have one
we're not aware of?

09:21.311 --> 09:23.230
Hidden cameras? I don't think so.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.023
Do you talk to the people
you're delivering to?

09:25.107 --> 09:27.401
"Sign here." That's about it.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.028
Have you seen anyone lately
lurking in between the houses?

09:30.112 --> 09:30.946
Lurking?

09:31.029 --> 09:33.573
How about unfamiliar cars
parked in the alleys?

09:33.657 --> 09:35.284
I got a lot on my plate.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.703
I can't be keeping track
of who's parking where.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.320
You won a judgment against SIS?

10:11.403 --> 10:14.031
The city settled it
before it went to trial.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.867
My first big case after I left the DA's.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.160
Why'd the city settle?

10:18.243 --> 10:20.620
Problems with some
of the officers' depositions.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.039
They were lying?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.707
Coordinating their testimony.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.084
Mm. Cosgrove?

10:26.168 --> 10:27.794
He was one of 'em.

10:27.878 --> 10:33.050
I'm interested in his disciplinary record.
I'm assuming you saw it during discovery.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.843
Yeah, I can give you a thumbnail.

10:34.926 --> 10:39.222
Smart, ambitious,
aggressive, proactive.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.640
Walks right up to the line.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.563
Up to the line, but not over it?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.358
He likes to stress-test the system.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.277
Hmm. Excessive force complaints?

10:52.361 --> 10:56.198
A few. But not many, considering
how long he's been on the job.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.700
A number of commendations too.

10:58.784 --> 11:02.371
His officers swear by him.
"A cop's cop."

There might be genetic evidence
inside and outside that mask.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.422
I'm in court.
It's a very important case.

13:59.506 --> 14:03.343
I don't remember what,
but the galleries were packed.

14:04.761 --> 14:10.016
And I get up to give my summation
and I suddenly realize I'm naked.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.770
That's a classic kind of anxiety dream.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.397
To be naked in front of strangers.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.775
Oh, yeah, I know,
it's a total fucking cliché. I hate it.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.486
But that's not the interesting part.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.904
Okay.

14:22.988 --> 14:27.367
I told you I woke up.
But that was still part of the dream.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.538
So in the dream, I wake up...

14:31.621 --> 14:35.250
and I realize I've killed someone.

14:36.876 --> 14:41.172
And I've completely forgotten about it
until just that moment.

14:41.256 --> 14:44.801
I'm so horrified that I wake up.
Like, I actually wake up.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.637
Like, sit up in bed, sweating.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.684
Who'd you kill?

14:54.436 --> 14:55.270
I don't know.

14:56.938 --> 14:57.772
Rogers?

14:59.190 --> 15:00.442
I didn't see his face.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.738
How'd you kill him?

15:08.825 --> 15:10.076
I hit him with my car.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.996
Ran him over and just drove away.

15:14.331 --> 15:18.752
And then...
put it out of my mind.

15:22.213 --> 15:26.051
The thing is, the dream was so real, I...

15:27.344 --> 15:28.595
I couldn't shake it.

15:28.678 --> 15:34.517
Like, for the next hour, I kept thinking,
"Oh, my God. Did I really do this?

15:34.601 --> 15:39.439
Did I actually kill someone
and just totally suppress it?"

15:40.440 --> 15:44.653
I even went out and checked
my car for signs of a hit-and-run.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.571
Did you find anything?

15:47.947 --> 15:50.450
[sighs] No.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.537
What do you make of it?

15:56.206 --> 15:58.041
I think you feel guilty about something.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.002
Hmm. Don't we all?

16:05.757 --> 16:07.092
Can't beat that view.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.593
A million-dollar view.

16:09.594 --> 16:10.679
Oh, thank you.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.263
-Careful, it's hot.
-Yeah.

16:14.432 --> 16:18.186
So... what do you think
I can get for it?

16:18.269 --> 16:19.813
In this market?

16:19.896 --> 16:21.940
For sake of argument.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.191
As is?

16:23.274 --> 16:25.568
As is, or if I bring it up to code.
Either or.

16:25.652 --> 16:29.531
As is? A million seven, million eight.

16:29.614 --> 16:30.699
Wow. Seriously?

16:30.782 --> 16:33.535
As you said, a million-dollar view.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.037
What about up to code?

16:36.121 --> 16:39.290
Two one, two two. Ballpark.

16:39.374 --> 16:40.709
That's an attractive ballpark.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.919
If you have the time and money.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.963
Cost you 50K to retrofit it.

16:45.046 --> 16:48.133
And the aggravation of dealing
with contractors and permits?

16:48.216 --> 16:49.968
Months before you
could put it on the market.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.511
What would you do?

16:53.138 --> 16:56.641
Take the money and run.
Let it be someone else's headache.

17:01.980 --> 17:02.814
[engine shuts off]

17:17.537 --> 17:20.832
-Is any of this legal?
-Not even remotely.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.712
There you go, bro. The good doctor's
most recent prescription audit.

17:25.795 --> 17:29.007
Every doc who works at his clinic.
Who's the target?

17:29.090 --> 17:33.052
-Who wrote the most opioid scripts?
-Let's see. Uh...

17:34.053 --> 17:36.473
Dr. Vince Shipman by a mile.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.724
That was fast.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.977
Well, that was easy.
Dr. Basu flagged it.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.855
Followed up with a meeting with Shipman
a couple days after the audit,

17:43.938 --> 17:46.900
calling him on the carpet
for his profligate prescribing ways.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.902
Do me a favor.

17:48.985 --> 17:52.363
Print me out a list of his patients
that he was writing prescriptions for.

17:52.447 --> 17:55.784
[Mo] A lot of them are homeless.
No fixed address.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.995
Dr. Shipman your doctor at the clinic?

17:59.078 --> 18:03.833
It varies. Dr. Basu was my main doctor.
Till, you know.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.463
What has Dr. Shipman
been prescribing for you?

18:08.546 --> 18:10.465
Nothing.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.884
Nothing? You sure?

18:12.967 --> 18:16.262
Nothing I can't get myself
at the CVS.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.557
I gotta tell you, it says right here,
he's been prescribing you oxy.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.059
[scoffs] I wish.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.354
Thanks.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.198
[engine shuts off]

18:41.996 --> 18:44.290
Poydras. As I live and breathe.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.126
You guys just can't get enough
of them big city lights, huh?

18:48.711 --> 18:49.963
Who's your new partner?

18:50.046 --> 18:51.714
Name's Musso.

18:52.674 --> 18:53.508
You're kidding.

18:53.591 --> 18:54.843
Who'd Vance really hire you to find?

18:54.926 --> 18:58.012
And don't give us
the long-lost USC frat mate crap.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.516
This one's a real charmer.
What happened to Franks?

19:01.599 --> 19:03.977
Dropped dead. Aneurysm.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.520
Sorry to hear that.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.813
[Musso]
Answer the question.

19:08.022 --> 19:11.234
He got a girl pregnant at USC.
The girl was Mexican.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.777
His father threatened to disinherit him.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.529
Mm. So he ditched her.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.739
Said he felt guilty about it all his life.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.824
A little late.

19:19.033 --> 19:22.579
Told me he wanted to balance the books,
set things right before he died.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.289
And did you find an heir?

19:24.372 --> 19:25.790
Oh, this is where we trade.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.126
You ask a question, I ask a question.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.130
Okay, ask your question.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.089
Cause of death?

19:33.172 --> 19:36.676
He was found slumped over at his desk
and it looked like a natural.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.512
But because he's
Whitney fucking Vance, billionaire,

19:39.596 --> 19:42.891
Coroner sees a chance to milk the media,
orders an autopsy.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.310
Lo and behold,
finds a faint petechial hemorrhaging,

19:45.393 --> 19:46.686
rules it undetermined.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.480
So we go back out there,
take a few pictures,

19:49.564 --> 19:51.149
toss the pad a second time.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.694
[Poydras] Check the couch pillows,
find what looks like dried saliva on one.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.029
We get a DNA match to Vance.

19:56.112 --> 19:59.032
Figure somebody took the pillow,
came around behind him,

19:59.115 --> 20:00.199
and held it over his face.

20:00.283 --> 20:02.118
Wouldn't take much.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.537
Our turn. You find an heir?

20:04.621 --> 20:06.956
Girl had the baby,
put it up for adoption.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.083
I traced the adoption,
identified the child.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.711
Thing is, he went down
in a helicopter in Vietnam

20:11.794 --> 20:14.923
a month shy of his 20th birthday, 1972.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.049
You tell Vance?

20:16.132 --> 20:17.842
That's two in a row. Don't get greedy.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.137
Yes, I did.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.139
My turn.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.433
Who had access to his office
the day he died?

20:26.643 --> 20:28.353
Security people, mostly.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.772
David Sloan. Who else?

20:30.855 --> 20:33.691
A chef. A nurse. His secretary.

20:34.776 --> 20:35.777
Ida Porter.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.488
-She was the one who found him.
-We're checking them all.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.365
Have you taken a look
at the corporate angle?

20:40.448 --> 20:41.950
We're looking at everybody.

20:42.033 --> 20:45.286
Philip Corwin. He's the one that stands
to gain the most if there's no heir.

20:45.370 --> 20:49.248
Like I said, everybody's a suspect
until they're not.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.334
You said his secretary was there.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.127
He called her in to write letters for him.

20:53.211 --> 20:58.049
His custom stationery, fancy pen,
all laid out and waiting.

20:58.132 --> 20:59.550
What do you mean, his fancy pen?

20:59.634 --> 21:02.971
Flashy gold fountain pen. Filigreed.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.597
You got a picture of it in there
from the scene?

21:04.681 --> 21:05.682
Mm-hmm.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.951
You said you went back after the autopsy,
took some more pictures.

21:25.076 --> 21:29.414
They're in the back.
Everything's chronological.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.131
The pen's not there.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.551
[Musso] You're right.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.635
Where'd it go?

21:43.845 --> 21:45.805
Who knows?

21:45.888 --> 21:47.432
We didn't take it.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.541
[line out rings]

22:14.333 --> 22:15.293
[Poydras] Bosch.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.128
How's your morning looking?

22:17.211 --> 22:19.672
For you, my morning's wide open. Why?

22:19.756 --> 22:23.259
Meet me at Ida Porter's house
in half an hour.

22:27.305 --> 22:29.098
Shall we proceed with the plan?

22:29.182 --> 22:30.016
Let's do it.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.690
Mr. Bosch, I wasn't expecting
to see you so soon.

22:37.774 --> 22:38.691
Is now not a good time?

22:38.775 --> 22:40.193
Not at all. Please come in.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.452
Ida Porter. Honey Chandler.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.369
Pleased to meet you.

22:50.453 --> 22:53.748
Ms. Chandler represents
a direct descendant of Whitney Vance.

22:53.831 --> 22:54.874
The rightful heir.

22:54.957 --> 22:59.420
I'm so glad. I was worried sick that
the estate would pass to the corporation.

22:59.504 --> 23:02.006
Oh, rest assured,
that is not going to happen.

23:02.090 --> 23:06.302
The proof is in the pudding.
Did you bring the affidavit?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.971
You might wanna take a moment
and read it before you sign.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.027
It all looks in order.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.570
Don't we need a notary?

23:24.654 --> 23:29.617
Oh, it's fine. I'm an officer of the court
and Mr. Bosch is the second witness.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.620
And... I have a pen.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.082
You still have his pen.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.126
I do indeed.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.503
You see it's returned
to its rightful owner.

23:41.546 --> 23:42.380
His heir.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.437
When will you file the new will?

23:58.521 --> 24:01.816
Oh, you mean,
when will you get your money?

24:01.899 --> 24:03.568
No, that's not what I meant at all.

24:03.651 --> 24:07.029
I'm just curious when I might
need a lawyer to represent my interests.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.491
Probably use a lawyer right now,
but not the kind you're thinking of.

24:10.575 --> 24:12.243
What are you talking about?

24:12.326 --> 24:13.870
We're not filing the will.

24:14.912 --> 24:15.746
Why on earth not?

24:15.830 --> 24:17.832
Whitney Vance didn't write it.

24:17.915 --> 24:18.916
You did.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.002
That's preposterous.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.379
I saw his hand tremor.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.631
He hasn't written anything in years.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.009
He had you write for him.

24:29.010 --> 24:30.803
You learned to imitate his handwriting.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.056
That's a grand story.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.058
Like something out of a gothic novel.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.518
But it's nonsense.

24:37.602 --> 24:42.481
Great-granddaddy's gold pen
was in my mailbox...

24:42.565 --> 24:46.944
the moment you supposedly discovered
Whitney Vance's body at his desk.

24:47.028 --> 24:51.073
Death scene photos,
they show an identical pen on his desk.

24:53.451 --> 24:54.452
I want you to leave now.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.163
Ida, there's something
you need to know.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.874
You're never gonna see a dime
of that ten million.

24:59.957 --> 25:04.170
It's the law. A murderer
cannot inherit from her victim's estate.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.129
I'm not a murderer.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.215
Then what are you, Ida?

25:07.298 --> 25:09.884
You smothered that man with a pillow.

25:09.967 --> 25:12.803
The police know.
They're on their way here now.

25:12.887 --> 25:16.140
So you can tell us what happened
and maybe we can help you out.

25:16.224 --> 25:21.062
If I'm representing you, everything
we've discussed becomes confidential.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.314
We can go to the police
and the district attorney

25:23.397 --> 25:26.067
and get you the best deal possible.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.027
[vehicle approaches]

25:44.669 --> 25:45.670
You have it all wrong.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.341
It was a horrible, horrible mistake.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.761
He was supposed to die, you see.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.018
He had taken ill overnight.

26:02.603 --> 26:03.521
He looked awful.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.859
He told me that he was dying
and he needed to write a new will.

26:10.695 --> 26:13.990
He dictated the terms
and I wrote it in his hand.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.078
Then he gave me the pen and told me
to send everything to you, Mr. Bosch.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.748
Only there was something missing.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.960
Something important.

26:27.670 --> 26:28.546
[Bosch] You.

26:30.298 --> 26:31.340
Forgot about you.

26:34.385 --> 26:35.219
All these years.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.763
At his beck and call.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.559
He took you for granted.

26:41.642 --> 26:46.605
That was the thing. He didn't.
He relied on me.

26:48.065 --> 26:51.027
So you amended the new will.

26:52.153 --> 26:53.154
I had the pen.

26:55.156 --> 26:58.659
I did what was right,
what was deserved.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.538
I rewrote the will to make it fair.

27:04.165 --> 27:07.335
It was so little
compared to all there was.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.297
You said he was supposed to die.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.008
He'd been at death's door.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.345
But then he rallied.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.139
Called me in unexpectedly.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.143
Told me to contact you
to retrieve the will.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.228
Now that he was better,
he wanted to withdraw it

27:26.312 --> 27:28.814
and have a lawyer redo it formally.

27:28.898 --> 27:31.776
And he'd see what you'd done.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.819
How you had altered the will.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.446
That would be the end.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.324
I couldn't let that happen.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.078
Something broke inside me.

27:45.081 --> 27:49.126
I picked up a pillow
and came up behind him.

27:51.420 --> 27:55.216
The second gold pen.
Where'd it come from?

27:57.051 --> 27:59.011
He said that was the original

27:59.095 --> 28:01.931
and that what he'd had me send you
was a duplicate.

28:03.099 --> 28:03.933
Where is it now?

28:05.518 --> 28:07.436
In my safe deposit box.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.939
[vehicle doors open]

28:16.904 --> 28:18.280
How do you wanna play it, Anna?

28:24.662 --> 28:25.621
Please invite them in.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.542
All right, watch your step here.

28:36.841 --> 28:40.636
They actually seem pissed off
we cleared their fucking case for them.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.846
Ungrateful bastards.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.639
Push yourself down.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.558
[Bosch] They won't look so good
when they have to explain

28:45.641 --> 28:48.185
that the suspect turned herself in

28:48.269 --> 28:50.646
before they even knew
she was the suspect.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.231
[engine starts]

29:11.959 --> 29:13.961
[sprinklers whirring]

29:34.023 --> 29:35.399
[sighs]

29:37.401 --> 29:39.236
Mrs. Davis, is, uh...

29:39.320 --> 29:40.446
Is now a good time?

29:40.529 --> 29:42.448
What do you want?

29:42.531 --> 29:44.200
I just wanna pay my respects.

29:45.201 --> 29:46.202
No, please.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.496
[sighs]

29:51.457 --> 29:53.167
I just wanna tell you how sorry I am.

29:54.335 --> 29:55.169
What happened--

29:55.252 --> 29:58.506
You promised
Nicole wouldn't get hurt.

30:00.257 --> 30:01.592
You promised to protect her.

30:11.894 --> 30:14.104
[sighs]

30:14.188 --> 30:17.816
Most of all, I wanna prevent false claims
on Mr. Vance's fortune.

30:20.736 --> 30:25.449
If we're not careful, we might have a
Howard Hughes-type situation on our hands.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.035
I understand.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.379
I appreciate you taking the time.

30:38.462 --> 30:39.463
Sorry I'm on the run.

30:39.547 --> 30:42.007
Supposed to meet a C.I.
in Baldwin Hills in about 30.

30:42.091 --> 30:43.175
Good luck with that.

30:43.259 --> 30:46.220
I'm just trying to close out
the criminal inquiry on James Sharp.

30:46.303 --> 30:47.972
I turned in everything I had.

30:48.055 --> 30:51.392
I reviewed it all,
but I also have Cosgrove's report.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.061
He refers to James Sharp
as suspect number one

30:54.144 --> 30:56.564
and Nicole Davis as suspect number two.

30:57.690 --> 30:58.524
That the way you see it?

30:58.607 --> 31:01.193
I wanna know what you really think
about Nicole Davis.

31:03.028 --> 31:03.862
Between us?

31:03.946 --> 31:05.864
You tell me.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.787
I told Cosgrove
Nicole Davis was coerced by Sharp.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.789
That she was an unwilling participant.

31:13.872 --> 31:17.459
Her mother told you that.
Maybe you got played by the family.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.129
Well, you heard the recording.
Does it sound like she's playing?

31:20.212 --> 31:21.630
Then why'd she go along with it?

31:21.714 --> 31:24.008
To stay alive and to get back to her kid.

31:24.091 --> 31:27.344
SIS should've taken into account
there was a victim in the car,

31:27.428 --> 31:28.262
not a suspect.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.264
Then why didn't you say that
in your documents?

31:30.347 --> 31:33.892
I all but did.
I couldn't slant it too far.

31:33.976 --> 31:37.062
Thing like this,
everyone goes into protect mode.

31:37.146 --> 31:38.939
Isn't that why you're here?

31:39.023 --> 31:40.983
Trying to figure out
how best to write your report.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.736
I'm trying to remain
as objective as possible.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.779
I might have to stand by this
in court someday.

31:45.863 --> 31:48.198
So just the facts, then, right?

31:58.334 --> 31:59.668
[engine starts]

31:59.752 --> 32:03.047
[indistinct chatter]

32:03.130 --> 32:08.052
[phone vibrates]

32:09.678 --> 32:11.263
This is Madeline Bosch.

32:11.347 --> 32:13.057
[Dockweiler]
Hi there, you left me a message.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.475
Did I?

32:14.558 --> 32:16.769
About an inspection notice
in East Hollywood.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.646
Oh, right.

32:18.729 --> 32:20.272
Is there a problem with the notice?

32:20.356 --> 32:22.024
We're just canvassing the neighborhood.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.109
There's been a series
of daytime sexual assaults.

32:24.193 --> 32:25.069
You may have heard.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.488
No, I hadn't heard that.
That's terrible.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.865
Are you in the area often, mister...

32:29.948 --> 32:31.950
Dockweiler. Kurt Dockweiler.

32:32.034 --> 32:34.578
Okay, well, if you see
anything out of the ordinary,

32:34.662 --> 32:37.498
please do not hesitate
to give me a call back at this number.

32:37.581 --> 32:40.709
Absolutely.
I'll do anything I can to help.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.297
That's a solid find, Officer Bosch.

32:45.381 --> 32:47.049
Ah, I got lucky.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.218
Right time, right trash can.

32:49.301 --> 32:54.264
Maybe they pull some prints
or DNA off the mask.

32:54.348 --> 32:57.059
Well, here's the thing.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.894
Can't always rely on physical evidence.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.313
Yeah, I mean, the cases,
they're linked by DNA,

33:01.397 --> 33:02.648
but the suspect's not in CODIS.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.441
That's what I'm talking about.

33:04.525 --> 33:06.694
So what would you look for?

33:06.777 --> 33:09.905
It's a serial.
You have to identify the patterns.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.116
Victims all live in the same area, right?

33:12.199 --> 33:14.243
Yep, Thai Town.
Daytime home invasion.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.662
How's he gain entry?

33:16.745 --> 33:18.997
He cuts the screen.
He goes in through the window.

33:19.081 --> 33:22.501
Victims know one another?
Have similar daytime activities?

33:22.584 --> 33:24.169
I don't know.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.924
Any other way this guy
could have gotten his eye on 'em?

33:29.007 --> 33:31.343
I don't know.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.515
Well, if the detectives
are doing their job,

33:36.598 --> 33:39.435
those are the things that they'll look at
to connect the cases.

33:48.610 --> 33:50.612

If we're not careful,

34:23.353 --> 34:27.608
we might have a Howard Hughes-type
situation on our hands.

34:29.151 --> 34:32.237
He's careful.
Plausible deniability.

34:33.322 --> 34:36.992
Until we know more,
I'm gonna post up on the heirs.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.787
I'll let Vibiana know
you're gonna be keeping an eye out.

34:39.870 --> 34:45.375
[camera shutter clicking]

34:53.509 --> 34:55.135
Harry Bosch on line two.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.012
Oh. Thanks, Matthew.

34:59.181 --> 35:00.015
Is it safe?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.643
Should be. Just in case.

35:02.726 --> 35:03.936
We have a match.

35:05.187 --> 35:06.897
Now all we gotta do
is keep 'em alive.

35:07.815 --> 35:08.816
How do we do that?

35:08.899 --> 35:10.651
I'm working on it.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.747
[Creighton]
Fucking traitor.

35:23.831 --> 35:25.082
I'll take care of it.

35:36.927 --> 35:37.761
We have a problem.

Sloan.

[phone vibrates]

35:50.774 --> 35:51.775
[phone vibrates]

35:53.527 --> 35:54.361
Hey.

35:54.444 --> 35:57.072
Harry. Mr. Sloan just called to come up.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.907
Okay. He say what for?

35:58.991 --> 36:00.325
To do a security check.

36:00.409 --> 36:02.578
Okay, so he's probably just being--

36:02.661 --> 36:06.623
He did one tonight already, Harry.
Plus I gave him a key.

36:06.707 --> 36:08.834
Why would he say "buzz me in"
if he has a key?

36:08.917 --> 36:10.836
Okay, you need to get out of there.

36:10.961 --> 36:13.088
Get out of there, grab your son,
take the stairs, and get out of there.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.381
I'm on my way. I'll find you.

36:15.841 --> 36:18.093
[suspenseful music playing]

-Mom?
-Get up, mijo.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.435
-What's going on?
-Things are gonna be okay.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.811
-What is it?
-Just come with me.

36:27.895 --> 36:29.897
-Everything's fine. Just follow me.
-You're scaring me.

39:39.044 --> 39:42.631
Okay. Okay, go.
We gotta go quick.

Go, quick.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.229

-Quiet, mijo.

39:59.773 --> 40:01.525
I'm scared.
