01:20.333 --> 01:21.668
Hey, it's Jeff and Joanna.

01:21.669 --> 01:23.536
We're here for the sublet.

01:32.780 --> 01:34.647
How are you doing?

01:41.989 --> 01:42.823
Hello?

01:46.694 --> 01:47.528
Hello?

01:48.596 --> 01:49.430
Wow.

01:53.501 --> 01:54.967
Left a note.

01:58.005 --> 01:59.572
Whoa.

01:59.573 --> 02:02.108
What's all this stuff?

02:02.109 --> 02:03.711
That's interesting.

02:04.678 --> 02:07.614
You will find the key inside the fifth
drawer of the bedroom dresser.

02:07.615 --> 02:09.716
After you've decide this is not
a place for you to stay,

02:09.717 --> 02:13.352
then please shut the door behind you
and leave the building immediately.

02:13.353 --> 02:14.187
Thank you.

02:15.456 --> 02:16.456
Well that's a weird note, isn't it baby.

02:16.457 --> 02:17.290
Yeah.

02:18.959 --> 02:21.629
Let's go see what's over here.

02:23.831 --> 02:25.265
Oh, look at this.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.767
Oh, it's a decent size.

02:27.768 --> 02:28.868
It's good.

02:28.869 --> 02:29.902
Yeah.

02:29.903 --> 02:31.138
What's in here?

02:33.441 --> 02:34.474
It's locked.

02:34.475 --> 02:36.375
What's in there?

02:36.376 --> 02:37.944
Must be where the owner keeps her stuff.

02:37.945 --> 02:40.781
We're not supposed to go in there.

02:41.949 --> 02:43.716
What's this?

02:43.717 --> 02:45.017
That's going to be your room.

02:45.018 --> 02:46.787
That maybe your room.

02:47.721 --> 02:49.056
It looks like...

02:53.861 --> 02:55.828
Wow.

02:55.829 --> 02:58.698
So what do you think of the place?

02:58.699 --> 03:01.333
I just had de ja vu.

03:01.334 --> 03:03.269
That's a good thing.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.237
Yeah, it's a good thing.

03:05.238 --> 03:06.339
I don't know.

03:10.343 --> 03:11.678
I guess it will do for now.

03:11.679 --> 03:12.780
Hey, munchkin.

03:13.847 --> 03:15.347
For now?

03:15.348 --> 03:17.550
Well, until you can buy us
a big house in Malibu

03:17.551 --> 03:20.152
and you become rich and famous.

03:20.153 --> 03:24.023
Til then, be a good dad,
go unpack the car.

03:24.024 --> 03:24.858
Alright.

03:25.759 --> 03:27.260
You gonna miss me?

03:28.962 --> 03:30.162
I know.

03:30.163 --> 03:31.565
It's so exciting.

03:49.316 --> 03:52.419
Oh, we haven't done that in forever.

03:53.621 --> 03:55.822
Hasn't been that long.

03:55.823 --> 03:56.824
Oh my God.

03:58.158 --> 03:59.926
That was amazing.

03:59.927 --> 04:01.193
It was okay.

04:01.194 --> 04:02.662
What?

04:03.797 --> 04:05.565
I'm just kidding.

04:05.566 --> 04:06.667
You're right.

04:07.935 --> 04:10.837
You're right, it was good.

04:13.674 --> 04:15.241
Did you hear that?

04:15.242 --> 04:16.076
What?

04:17.978 --> 04:20.046
Sounded like
a rocking chair or something.

04:20.047 --> 04:21.648
Rocking chair?

04:21.649 --> 04:22.782
It's probably just the neighbors.

04:22.783 --> 04:24.416
Yeah.

04:24.417 --> 04:28.220
Hey, wish me luck tomorrow, will you?

04:28.221 --> 04:30.623
You don't need it.

04:30.624 --> 04:31.625
You think?

04:33.827 --> 04:34.662
I know.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.432
I'd still like some though.

04:39.433 --> 04:40.267
Okay.

04:41.301 --> 04:42.135
Okay.

06:14.728 --> 06:15.728
Hey.

06:15.729 --> 06:17.864
So, I had a great shoot.

06:17.865 --> 06:20.332
Shh, the baby's sleeping.

06:20.333 --> 06:21.168
Right.

06:22.369 --> 06:23.570
The director thinks the role
could be recurring.

06:23.571 --> 06:24.704
No.

06:24.705 --> 06:25.705
Yeah.

06:25.706 --> 06:26.774
That's great.

06:29.042 --> 06:30.643
We have to stay in town all season.

06:30.644 --> 06:31.844
That's okay.

06:31.845 --> 06:33.746
I'm not back to work for a while, so.

06:33.747 --> 06:35.648
Yeah, there we go.

06:35.649 --> 06:37.149
Yeah.

06:37.150 --> 06:38.451
My manager's booked me for
a bunch of meetings this week

06:38.452 --> 06:39.852
so I'm gonna be pretty unavailable.

06:39.853 --> 06:41.588
You going to be okay by yourself?

06:41.589 --> 06:42.955
Yeah.

06:42.956 --> 06:43.791
Of course.

06:48.896 --> 06:49.896
Love you.

06:49.897 --> 06:50.764
Love you.

07:04.111 --> 07:05.177
Hungry?

07:05.178 --> 07:06.013
Here.

07:08.816 --> 07:10.349
I went to the internet place today

07:10.350 --> 07:14.187
but they said they couldn't
hook it up in this building.

07:18.025 --> 07:20.693
So yeah, the address isn't
even listed in their database,

07:20.694 --> 07:24.932
so they think that the wiring
is probably too old or something.

07:25.799 --> 07:26.634
Yeah.

07:29.302 --> 07:31.303
You're not even listening.

07:31.304 --> 07:32.372
Sorry what?

07:34.007 --> 07:35.775
What were you saying?

07:35.776 --> 07:36.809
It's okay.

07:36.810 --> 07:38.377
You done?

07:38.378 --> 07:39.446
Yeah.

07:39.447 --> 07:40.280
Yeah.

07:45.285 --> 07:48.988
Sorry, I'm just really,
really nervous about tomorrow.

07:48.989 --> 07:49.990
It's fine.

07:51.191 --> 07:53.726
Look, if you want some help later on

07:53.727 --> 07:55.728
with your lines,
after the baby's asleep,

07:55.729 --> 07:57.564
I can work with you on it.

07:57.565 --> 07:58.965
Yeah, that would be good.

07:58.966 --> 07:59.800
Thanks.

08:23.524 --> 08:24.858
Jeff?

08:30.731 --> 08:32.131
Hello?

08:32.131 --> 08:32.966
Jeff?

08:41.174 --> 08:42.009
Jeff?

09:25.853 --> 09:26.687
Hello?

09:47.875 --> 09:48.709
Hello?

09:52.279 --> 09:53.113
Hello?

10:03.424 --> 10:04.857
Look at the camera.

10:04.858 --> 10:06.427
Alright here we go.

10:07.895 --> 10:09.396
Aw, that's cute.

10:45.165 --> 10:45.999
Hello?

10:56.444 --> 10:57.644
It's okay.

10:57.645 --> 10:58.879
I know, I know.

11:00.914 --> 11:02.949
Shh, it's okay.

11:02.950 --> 11:03.784
Shh.

11:09.490 --> 11:10.857
It's okay.

11:10.858 --> 11:13.292
Shh, are you hungry?

11:51.398 --> 11:52.232
Shh.

12:14.422 --> 12:16.556
Do you like it in here?

13:03.070 --> 13:04.070
Morning.

13:04.071 --> 13:05.638
Hey, I made you coffee.

13:05.639 --> 13:06.974
Oh, thank you.

13:10.410 --> 13:11.878
Is that sugar?

13:11.879 --> 13:16.549
I think I'm gonna do those
thank you letters today.

13:16.550 --> 13:19.553
There's some protein bars in here.

13:23.290 --> 13:25.626
Jeff, look out the window.

13:26.660 --> 13:27.660
What?

13:27.661 --> 13:29.897
Just look out the window.

13:34.067 --> 13:35.535
I don't see anything, okay.

13:35.536 --> 13:37.069
Jeff.

13:37.070 --> 13:38.070
There's nothing there.

13:38.071 --> 13:39.071
I got to go.

13:39.072 --> 13:39.907
Bye.

13:41.675 --> 13:43.343
There was someone.

14:20.848 --> 14:21.682
Porter?

14:23.551 --> 14:24.384
Porter.

14:28.522 --> 14:30.958
What are you doing over here?

14:32.125 --> 14:32.960
Hi.

14:34.061 --> 14:34.895
What?

14:36.964 --> 14:37.798
What?

14:42.302 --> 14:44.137
You want to go inside?

14:45.138 --> 14:46.706
Don't tell daddy.

14:46.707 --> 14:48.941
We're not supposed to be in here.

15:47.968 --> 15:50.670
They bang on the walls
as if there's something I can do

15:50.671 --> 15:52.972
to stop my baby from crying.

15:52.973 --> 15:55.575
But I never see anyone.

15:55.576 --> 15:57.478
Only hear them banging.

15:58.646 --> 16:02.349
I moved the nursery to the inner room,
in hopes of hiding the sound.

16:03.784 --> 16:05.785
George was upset that I did so
without asking him.

16:05.786 --> 16:11.624
The stress has been hard on him and
the baby keeps him awake at night.

16:11.625 --> 16:15.094
He's in a fowl mood all the time.

16:15.095 --> 16:16.596
I have no one to talk to.

16:16.597 --> 16:17.798
I'm so lonely.

16:26.574 --> 16:27.940
Hey, babe.

16:27.941 --> 16:28.776
Hey.

16:31.945 --> 16:32.880
You got it.

16:34.247 --> 16:35.314
Yeah.

16:35.315 --> 16:37.283
But not only that.

16:37.284 --> 16:40.052
But the producer thinks I'd be
perfect for a role in a film

16:40.053 --> 16:41.554
he's doing with Debrowski.

16:41.555 --> 16:43.189
Is that good?

16:43.190 --> 16:44.290
It's amazing.

16:44.291 --> 16:46.493
Okay, that's good.

16:46.494 --> 16:47.994
The only thing is,

16:47.995 --> 16:50.430
there'd be a scheduling
conflict with the TV show.

16:50.431 --> 16:52.565
I'd have to go to LA for six months.

16:52.566 --> 16:53.766
Would you do that?

16:53.767 --> 16:55.435
Yeah, of course.

16:55.436 --> 16:59.106
Give up a solid paycheck for
what's this thing pay?

17:00.340 --> 17:01.608
Not much.

17:01.609 --> 17:03.042
But the chance to work with Debrowski.

17:03.043 --> 17:04.645
Can't pass that up.

17:07.414 --> 17:10.116
Oh, do we have room for three?

17:10.117 --> 17:10.951
Why?

17:12.118 --> 17:13.953
I saw Alex on the way back.

17:13.954 --> 17:16.355
Alex as in your ex-girlfriend?

17:16.356 --> 17:17.190
Yeah.

17:18.391 --> 17:20.426
She's gonna help me run lines.

17:20.428 --> 17:21.861
She's coming over right now?

17:21.862 --> 17:23.262
Yeah.

17:23.262 --> 17:24.464
You have nothing to worry about.

17:24.464 --> 17:25.498
It's just business.

17:25.499 --> 17:27.867
I not worried Jeff.

17:27.867 --> 17:29.703
I just don't like her.

17:31.304 --> 17:32.472
Look at me.

17:32.473 --> 17:34.908
Can you give me some warning.

17:37.044 --> 17:38.745
I love you.

17:38.746 --> 17:39.580
Uh huh.

17:40.881 --> 17:41.881
Very much.

17:41.882 --> 17:43.349
You owe me.

17:43.350 --> 17:44.684
Uh huh.

17:44.685 --> 17:45.519
I do.

17:47.187 --> 17:48.921
I have to go get ready.

17:49.890 --> 17:50.691
Why not.

17:54.995 --> 17:55.995
Hey, you're here.

17:55.996 --> 17:56.996
And so.

17:56.997 --> 17:59.198
You look great.

17:59.199 --> 18:00.434
Hello Joanne.

18:02.135 --> 18:02.970
Hi.

18:04.638 --> 18:06.873
Alex, it's been a while.

18:06.874 --> 18:08.140
Yes.

18:08.141 --> 18:09.308
I hardly ever get time to get back.

18:09.309 --> 18:11.444
My schedule is insane.

18:15.148 --> 18:15.983
Pardon?

18:18.318 --> 18:19.252
I forget.

18:22.089 --> 18:24.090
Can I help you set the table?

18:24.091 --> 18:25.325
No, I'm fine.

18:26.494 --> 18:27.994
I just hope I made enough food.

18:27.995 --> 18:30.262
Jeff gave me no warning
that you were coming, so.

18:30.263 --> 18:31.498
Don't worry about it.

18:31.499 --> 18:34.568
I probably don't eat as much as you do.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.842
I'm going to kill her.

18:43.376 --> 18:44.977
Joanne.

18:44.978 --> 18:48.648
Would you like to work out
with me while I'm in town?

18:48.649 --> 18:49.949
Well you seem to be in great shape Alex,

18:49.950 --> 18:52.318
so you must spend all
your time at the gym.

18:52.319 --> 18:53.886
I work out every day.

18:53.887 --> 18:56.155
Well with a baby, I never
seem to find the time.

18:56.156 --> 18:57.990
You have to make the time.

18:57.991 --> 19:00.994
I do and it can be very therapeutic.

19:05.165 --> 19:06.933
Ugh, is that lamb?

19:06.934 --> 19:07.934
Yes.

19:07.935 --> 19:09.068
I'm a vegetarian.

19:09.069 --> 19:10.671
For health reasons.

19:12.272 --> 19:15.442
But, politically I can't stand

19:15.443 --> 19:17.176
the thought of murdering animals.

19:17.177 --> 19:18.945
I'll have a salad.

19:18.946 --> 19:20.514
You eat salad, oui?

19:22.716 --> 19:24.617
Don't you guys have to run lines?

19:24.618 --> 19:26.152
Hey Joanne,

19:26.153 --> 19:28.455
did you ever get ahold of your family?

19:28.456 --> 19:29.289
Pardon?

19:31.258 --> 19:32.224
Oh not saying,

19:32.225 --> 19:33.926
I just, I over Jeff's agent

19:33.927 --> 19:36.529
telling him that
your family were phoning.

19:36.530 --> 19:37.930
Yeah, shit, Morgan called.

19:37.931 --> 19:40.433
He wants to know why you
haven't called your sister yet.

19:40.434 --> 19:42.168
What do you mean?

19:42.169 --> 19:43.903
Well he said that she wants to know

19:43.904 --> 19:45.438
why you haven't phoned

19:45.439 --> 19:47.306
to you know, tell her you've
arrived safe and sound.

19:47.307 --> 19:49.075
Okay, well that's kind
of ridiculous because

19:49.076 --> 19:51.410
I just talked to her the other day,

19:51.411 --> 19:56.082
and you saw me phone my
mother when we got here.

19:56.083 --> 19:59.152
Alright, I'm just the messenger babe,
don't worry about it.

20:00.153 --> 20:01.320
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:01.321 --> 20:03.856
Do you think that
you're smoking in here?

20:03.857 --> 20:05.024
Is that a problem?

20:05.025 --> 20:07.326
Yeah, we don't smoke around the baby.

20:07.327 --> 20:09.929
For health reasons, you know.

20:09.930 --> 20:12.532
You can, go to the balcony,

20:12.533 --> 20:14.201
it's in the bedroom.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.776
Please don't wake the baby.

20:27.815 --> 20:29.782
She doesn't eat meat for health reasons

20:29.783 --> 20:31.951
but she smokes, are you kidding me?

20:31.952 --> 20:33.252
Come on.

20:33.253 --> 20:35.988
And you tell her to go our bedroom.

20:35.989 --> 20:37.289
Yeah, just give her a chance.

20:37.290 --> 20:40.260
I don't need to give her a chance.

20:41.595 --> 20:43.563
Run your lines, get her out of here.

20:43.564 --> 20:44.564
I'm taking a bath

20:44.565 --> 20:46.298
and then I'm going to bed.

20:46.299 --> 20:47.134
Clean up.

22:27.668 --> 22:28.736
I pity you.

23:57.925 --> 23:58.759
Jeff.

24:00.928 --> 24:02.095
Jeff, wake up.

24:32.660 --> 24:34.895
What are you doing in here?

25:11.031 --> 25:11.965
Hey babe.

25:13.901 --> 25:15.134
I totally passed out last night.

25:15.135 --> 25:16.936
I don't remember anything.

25:16.937 --> 25:19.105
Drink too much?

25:19.106 --> 25:20.573
Breakfast.

25:20.574 --> 25:22.208
Breakfast.

25:22.209 --> 25:23.209
Sorry.

25:23.210 --> 25:24.044
Sorry.

25:30.417 --> 25:34.422
Ugh, why do you keep
putting sugar in my coffee?

25:36.957 --> 25:38.224
I honestly don't know.

25:38.225 --> 25:39.759
It's not even ours.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.695
Alright, I got to go.

25:45.398 --> 25:47.400
What, no kiss goodbye?

25:51.038 --> 25:52.071
I'm sorry.

25:52.072 --> 25:52.873
Bye.

25:53.874 --> 25:54.974
Just stressed.

25:54.975 --> 25:55.976
These lines.

26:17.631 --> 26:18.566
Good job.

27:21.795 --> 27:23.464
Don't go in there.

27:26.567 --> 27:27.400
My baby.

27:28.536 --> 27:29.369
My baby.

27:33.073 --> 27:34.307
I need my baby.

27:35.375 --> 27:36.209
Please.

27:51.258 --> 27:55.194
The routine of every day drives me mad.

27:55.195 --> 27:57.264
I spend my days cleaning.

27:58.599 --> 28:00.099
George offers no help,

28:00.100 --> 28:03.470
but I feel as though I have
somehow disappointed him.

28:03.471 --> 28:05.705
My daughter is the only joy in my life,

28:05.706 --> 28:08.475
but she screams throughout the night.

28:08.476 --> 28:10.477
I'm exhausted.

28:10.478 --> 28:14.413
With no sleep, I struggle
through my empty life in a daze.

28:14.414 --> 28:17.216
I feel such unease in this place.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.718
Even when I know I'm alone,

28:18.719 --> 28:19.852
I feel as though

28:19.853 --> 28:22.122
there is someone else here.

28:38.939 --> 28:39.939
Where's the baby?

28:39.940 --> 28:41.942
In his crib, sleeping.

28:42.910 --> 28:44.076
I was just there.

28:44.077 --> 28:45.345
He's not there.

28:52.119 --> 28:53.386
Don't be mad.

29:05.533 --> 29:08.134
What the hell are you doing?

29:08.135 --> 29:09.401
Shhh.

29:09.402 --> 29:10.369
Why'd you put him in there?

29:10.370 --> 29:11.604
That's the owner's room.

29:11.605 --> 29:14.206
We're not supposed to be in there.

29:14.207 --> 29:15.575
I know, okay.

29:15.576 --> 29:16.843
I don't know how it happened.

29:16.844 --> 29:19.378
The other day he just wouldn't stop
crying so I rocked him in that chair

29:19.379 --> 29:21.247
and he had the best nap ever.

29:21.248 --> 29:22.849
We're not supposed to be in there, okay.

29:22.850 --> 29:25.051
It's also disgusting and musty

29:25.052 --> 29:26.886
and it can't be good for him at all.

29:26.887 --> 29:28.956
It's not that bad Jeff.

29:30.691 --> 29:33.225
And he likes it in there.

29:33.226 --> 29:34.226
He likes it in there?

29:34.227 --> 29:35.227
Yes.

29:35.228 --> 29:36.262
How could,

29:36.263 --> 29:37.329
Jeff.

29:37.330 --> 29:39.031
Please can he just nap in there.

29:39.032 --> 29:41.601
It makes my day a lot easier.

29:41.602 --> 29:42.635
No.

29:42.636 --> 29:43.870
I'm locking it later on.

29:43.871 --> 29:46.707
It should have been locked before.

29:48.742 --> 29:50.410
How'd it go today?

29:51.311 --> 29:52.646
Well I got it.

29:53.714 --> 29:54.914
The TV show thing?

29:54.915 --> 29:56.115
The film.

29:56.116 --> 29:56.950
I got it.

29:58.519 --> 30:00.887
What about the TV show?

30:00.888 --> 30:02.121
I don't know.

30:02.122 --> 30:05.626
Like, I'll know later
next week or something.

30:09.497 --> 30:10.330
He's up.

30:12.466 --> 30:13.466
Yeah.

30:13.467 --> 30:14.467
And do you hear that.

30:14.468 --> 30:16.402
He's not screaming.

30:16.403 --> 30:18.071
He's happy in there.

30:20.407 --> 30:22.141
Maybe that room is good
for something after all.

30:22.142 --> 30:23.375
Yeah, okay.

30:23.376 --> 30:24.644
If you think that we're having sex

30:24.645 --> 30:26.446
while our baby's in the other room
you better think again.

30:26.447 --> 30:28.148
Go change his diaper please.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.496
Hopefully you hear about
that TV show by next week.

30:43.497 --> 30:47.066
I mean it would make everything perfect.

30:47.067 --> 30:49.836
If the schedules don't conflict.

30:49.837 --> 30:52.505
No, I think that you
should try to make it work.

30:52.506 --> 30:54.273
They're not gonna push for me, Jo.

30:54.274 --> 30:56.375
I mean that if you can take both jobs,

30:56.376 --> 30:58.378
I think that you should.

31:00.448 --> 31:02.414
You know it's not like
I'm making a lot of money

31:02.415 --> 31:04.216
on mat leave.

31:04.217 --> 31:06.853
What if we want to have another baby?

31:06.854 --> 31:08.855
Yeah, you're right.

31:08.856 --> 31:09.856
You're right.

31:09.857 --> 31:10.691
I just,

31:12.125 --> 31:14.594
I really would like to

31:14.595 --> 31:16.128
find a more permanent place

31:16.129 --> 31:18.698
if we're going to stay here.

31:20.568 --> 31:22.234
What the hell was that?

31:22.235 --> 31:23.235
What?

31:23.236 --> 31:24.270
Didn't you hear that?

31:24.271 --> 31:25.371
No.

31:25.372 --> 31:27.941
This place is so creepy Jeff.

31:29.443 --> 31:31.377
You seriously want to find a new place?

31:31.378 --> 31:32.378
Yes.

31:32.379 --> 31:33.379
What if I have to go to LA?

31:33.380 --> 31:35.147
What, without us?

31:35.148 --> 31:36.415
No, I want you.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.885
I just really want to
get the baby settled.

31:38.886 --> 31:40.553
And I hate this place.

31:40.554 --> 31:41.921
Did you move anything in here?

31:41.922 --> 31:42.756
No.

31:43.857 --> 31:45.793
Okay, I'm locking it.

31:49.963 --> 31:50.897
Hey, hey.

31:50.898 --> 31:51.732
Whoa.

31:53.133 --> 31:54.366
You seriously what to
find a new place already?

31:54.367 --> 31:58.138
I'm sorry, it's just
really lonely and weird.

32:00.007 --> 32:02.575
I mean I can smell people
cooking in the hallway.

32:02.576 --> 32:03.910
I can hear footsteps.

32:03.911 --> 32:06.078
I can hear people talking,

32:06.079 --> 32:08.748
but I never see anyone.

32:08.749 --> 32:09.749
I don't know.

32:09.750 --> 32:10.750
Go outside.

32:10.751 --> 32:11.751
Go for a walk.

32:11.752 --> 32:12.785
I do.

32:12.786 --> 32:14.053
Jesus Christ.

32:14.054 --> 32:14.987
I get enough stress in my life already.

32:14.988 --> 32:16.556
All I know is I'm stuck here

32:16.557 --> 32:19.025
all day while you're out with Alex.

32:19.026 --> 32:20.292
Oh this is what it's all about.

32:20.293 --> 32:21.561
No, it's not.

32:21.562 --> 32:22.895
Okay, I just had a baby.

32:22.896 --> 32:24.063
My career is on hold.

32:24.064 --> 32:26.098
I feel fat and ugly.

32:26.099 --> 32:28.801
And you invite your ex
girlfriend over here

32:28.802 --> 32:30.738
without even asking me.

32:32.139 --> 32:33.139
Okay.

32:33.140 --> 32:33.974
I'm sorry.

32:35.275 --> 32:38.077
All I wanted was a phone call.

32:38.078 --> 32:40.513
With some warning, that's it.

32:40.514 --> 32:42.114
Alright, I'll know for next time.

32:42.115 --> 32:43.149
Next time.

32:43.150 --> 32:44.416
Yeah, okay.

32:44.417 --> 32:47.253
You think she's coming over again?

32:47.254 --> 32:49.288
Actually, she can't.

32:49.289 --> 32:50.824
She's gone missing.

32:53.494 --> 32:55.161
What do you mean missing?

32:55.162 --> 32:56.162
I don't know.

32:56.163 --> 32:57.296
What do you want me to say?

32:57.297 --> 32:58.297
She's missing.

32:58.298 --> 32:59.298
Are you serious?

32:59.299 --> 33:00.133
No.

33:01.168 --> 33:03.402
I don't think it's serious.

33:03.403 --> 33:05.805
She's probably just wondering
off with some producer.

33:05.806 --> 33:07.840
She does that sometimes.

33:07.841 --> 33:09.276
You're jealous.

33:10.210 --> 33:12.278
I'm not jealous.

33:12.279 --> 33:13.780
Well, doesn't surprise me.

33:13.781 --> 33:16.115
She's not that bright.

33:16.116 --> 33:17.850
Hey, can you call
your sister by the way?

33:17.851 --> 33:20.419
I talked to her yesterday.

33:20.421 --> 33:21.421
I don't know.

33:21.422 --> 33:23.623
My agent just keeps calling,
saying that she's calling

33:23.624 --> 33:24.991
and she doesn't know where you are.

33:24.992 --> 33:26.258
Well I don't know what
you want me to do Jeff.

33:26.259 --> 33:29.462
I asked her and she said that
she's never called your agent ever.

33:29.463 --> 33:31.397
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:31.398 --> 33:32.432
I don't know okay.

33:32.433 --> 33:33.500
Listen.

33:33.501 --> 33:35.735
I don't want to argue anymore.

33:35.736 --> 33:36.936
It's my fault.

33:36.937 --> 33:38.070
I brought Alex over.

33:38.071 --> 33:39.371
I'm sorry.

33:39.372 --> 33:40.707
Okay, come here.

33:40.708 --> 33:41.974
I'm sorry.

33:41.975 --> 33:44.444
I know that I sound crazy

33:44.445 --> 33:46.646
when I say I want to move,

33:46.647 --> 33:47.680
but I,

33:47.681 --> 33:49.850
I don't feel at home here.

33:51.885 --> 33:54.554
Let's just pause that.

33:54.555 --> 33:58.090
Til we wait until we
hear about the TV thing.

33:58.091 --> 33:58.926
Okay?

35:46.399 --> 35:48.068
One moment please.

36:06.153 --> 36:06.987
Hi.

36:08.789 --> 36:12.058
You don't mind if we come in.

36:12.059 --> 36:13.393
Of course not.

36:15.463 --> 36:16.395
How can I help you?

36:16.396 --> 36:17.897
We just have a few questions

36:17.898 --> 36:20.533
about a missing person's case.

36:20.534 --> 36:21.768
Oh right, yeah.

36:21.769 --> 36:23.169
I don't know how much help I'll be,

36:23.170 --> 36:24.370
but I'll certainly try.

36:24.371 --> 36:25.505
My baby's just sleeping,

36:25.506 --> 36:26.906
so if we could take it in here.

36:26.907 --> 36:28.274
Thank you.

36:28.275 --> 36:29.109
Uh huh.

36:30.544 --> 36:32.612
So you are aware there's
a missing person you said.

36:32.613 --> 36:33.880
How so?

36:33.881 --> 36:38.017
My fiance told me that
you had questioned him.

36:38.018 --> 36:42.189
We're here to discuss a
resident of this building.

36:46.293 --> 36:47.326
I'm sorry.

36:47.327 --> 36:49.662
Is Alex a resident here?

36:49.663 --> 36:51.030
I'm sorry?

36:51.031 --> 36:53.099
He said resident.

36:53.100 --> 36:55.535
Yes, a woman named Joanna.

36:55.536 --> 36:57.638
Joanna, but I'm Joanna.

36:59.172 --> 37:03.343
You're Joanna Margaret,
married to Jeffrey Mitchell?

37:05.779 --> 37:07.114
We're engaged.

37:08.782 --> 37:11.451
But you have a child together.

37:11.452 --> 37:12.885
Yes, we do.

37:12.886 --> 37:14.854
Are you aware that you're missing?

37:14.855 --> 37:15.689
Missing?

37:16.790 --> 37:18.225
I'm right here.

37:19.627 --> 37:22.028
You are aware that you
have a missing person's file?

37:22.029 --> 37:23.797
No, why would I be?

37:27.501 --> 37:29.902
Who phoned you to say
that I was missing?

37:29.903 --> 37:32.605
You have family that hasn't
heard from you in nearly a month.

37:32.606 --> 37:35.776
I just spoke to my sister yesterday.

37:38.011 --> 37:41.348
She looks nothing like the photograph.

37:42.683 --> 37:43.683
I'm sorry ma'am.

37:43.684 --> 37:45.452
It's just that you look nothing

37:45.453 --> 37:46.753
like the photo we have of you.

37:46.754 --> 37:48.354
Nothing at all.

37:48.355 --> 37:50.157
Can I see the photo?

37:58.799 --> 38:01.033
Okay, this isn't me.

38:01.034 --> 38:02.034
Isn't you?

38:02.035 --> 38:03.035
No.

38:03.036 --> 38:03.871
Clearly.

38:05.005 --> 38:06.973
That certainly would explain a lot.

38:06.974 --> 38:10.510
Do you not see how absurd this is?

38:10.511 --> 38:12.211
You know, we're gonna
need to see some ID.

38:12.212 --> 38:16.049
To make certain you are
who you think you are.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.949
Look, I can't find my ID.

38:53.487 --> 38:54.687
I thought that.

38:54.688 --> 38:56.123
Oh, look at this.

38:59.427 --> 39:00.827
Can I help you?

39:00.828 --> 39:04.665
Oh, no, we have everything
we need, thank you.

39:06.567 --> 39:07.734
You can't just come in here

39:07.735 --> 39:09.569
and start going through
my private photos

39:09.570 --> 39:11.237
without asking.

39:11.238 --> 39:12.505
Are these private?

39:12.506 --> 39:13.706
The book was on a shelf.

39:13.707 --> 39:14.707
Out in the open.

39:14.708 --> 39:15.808
For anyone to see.

39:15.809 --> 39:17.309
Okay, look.

39:17.310 --> 39:18.377
I'm a lawyer.

39:18.378 --> 39:19.446
Which firm?

39:19.447 --> 39:21.080
I'm not practicing right now.

39:21.081 --> 39:22.715
Of course not.

39:22.716 --> 39:26.185
You can't just go into a
person's private belonging

39:26.186 --> 39:28.555
because they granted you
access to the premises

39:28.556 --> 39:32.459
for a case that is frankly ridiculous.

39:32.460 --> 39:34.060
Ridiculous?

39:34.061 --> 39:35.995
You've come in here and told me

39:35.996 --> 39:37.096
that I'm missing,

39:37.097 --> 39:39.031
when I'm clearly right here.

39:39.032 --> 39:41.434
And now you're going through
my family's private affairs.

39:41.435 --> 39:43.002
It's illegal.

39:43.003 --> 39:45.237
And you'll be lucky if
I don't press charges.

39:45.238 --> 39:47.840
We'll come back another time.

39:47.841 --> 39:49.108
After you've calmed down.

39:49.109 --> 39:50.910
I've asked you to leave.

39:50.911 --> 39:54.146
Yeah, but we're gonna need this photo.

39:54.147 --> 39:55.414
For our case.

39:55.415 --> 39:56.416
What case?

39:57.518 --> 39:59.018
You found me.

39:59.019 --> 40:00.152
I'm right here.

40:00.153 --> 40:01.154
Case closed.

40:02.355 --> 40:03.423
Thank you.

40:03.424 --> 40:04.957
But we need this photograph.

40:04.958 --> 40:06.225
Why that photograph?

40:06.226 --> 40:07.394
Jeff is in it.

40:12.332 --> 40:13.166
Take it.

40:21.709 --> 40:24.545
You might want to check that baby.

40:39.259 --> 40:40.594
You know what.

41:24.304 --> 41:25.672
It's okay, it's okay.

41:38.686 --> 41:40.386
He never helps with the baby.

41:40.387 --> 41:42.855
We're nothing but a burden to him.

41:42.856 --> 41:46.594
I would leave but he
has hidden my documents.

41:48.929 --> 41:50.162
He is abusive.

41:50.163 --> 41:52.766
And no longer the man I married.

41:54.101 --> 41:55.735
I'm certain that he has been sleeping

41:55.736 --> 41:57.770
with the neighbor girl.

41:57.771 --> 41:59.138
Although I have never seen her.

41:59.139 --> 42:00.474
I can hear them.

42:01.909 --> 42:03.142
I want to put a hole in
the wall and catch him,

42:03.143 --> 42:06.045
but I'm afraid of what I might do

42:06.046 --> 42:07.881
if I were to see them.

42:11.752 --> 42:12.586
Please.

42:22.162 --> 42:22.996
Hey.

42:24.532 --> 42:25.798
Didn't hear you come in.

42:25.799 --> 42:28.367
I just put Porter down.

42:28.368 --> 42:30.471
I didn't hear back yet.

42:32.573 --> 42:34.642
It must be killing you.

42:36.510 --> 42:38.410
Well I feel like shit.

42:38.411 --> 42:41.682
I think I'm coming down with something.

42:43.584 --> 42:45.318
You feel a bit hot.

42:49.222 --> 42:51.357
The cops stopped by today.

42:51.358 --> 42:52.426
About Alex?

42:53.393 --> 42:54.227
No.

42:56.530 --> 42:57.531
It was about...

42:59.833 --> 43:02.936
I don't even know how to say this so,

43:04.772 --> 43:06.238
there was this homeless woman

43:06.239 --> 43:08.808
who wanted inside of our apartment.

43:08.809 --> 43:09.809
You didn't let her in did you?

43:09.810 --> 43:10.910
Of course not, but,

43:10.911 --> 43:13.345
when the cops were here,

43:13.346 --> 43:14.681
they showed me a picture,

43:14.682 --> 43:17.016
and I think it was her.

43:17.017 --> 43:18.985
Did you tell them you'd seen her?

43:18.986 --> 43:20.086
No.

43:20.087 --> 43:21.554
I didn't connect it at the time,

43:21.555 --> 43:24.691
because she looks a lot older now.

43:24.692 --> 43:27.960
We should probably phone them then.

43:27.961 --> 43:28.796
Yeah.

43:29.963 --> 43:32.231
But this is where it gets really weird.

43:32.232 --> 43:36.403
I think it's the woman
that we're subletting from.

43:39.507 --> 43:40.540
That's crazy.

43:40.541 --> 43:41.775
I know it is.

43:43.176 --> 43:44.110
Well how do you even
know what she looks like?

43:44.111 --> 43:46.714
From the pictures in the room.

43:47.881 --> 43:49.816
That probably just looks like her.

43:49.817 --> 43:51.652
No, I don't think so.

43:53.654 --> 43:56.255
Joanna, we're not subletting
from a missing woman.

43:56.256 --> 43:57.491
Think about it.

44:01.529 --> 44:03.129
They didn't say that she was missing.

44:03.130 --> 44:05.533
They said that I was missing.

44:09.002 --> 44:11.037
You probably just misheard them.

44:11.038 --> 44:14.173
They made comments about my weight.

44:14.174 --> 44:16.375
Don't worry about that.

44:16.376 --> 44:17.844
You just had a kid.

44:17.845 --> 44:21.281
You'll be back to sexy
Joanna in no time.

44:23.984 --> 44:26.919
Well they made me feel really gross.

44:26.920 --> 44:28.321
But I guess I am.

44:29.289 --> 44:30.289
I didn't mean it like that.

44:30.290 --> 44:31.691
You're such an asshole.

44:31.692 --> 44:33.726
Where the hell is this coming from?

44:33.727 --> 44:35.294
I hope you're having fun with Alex

44:35.295 --> 44:38.130
while I'm stuck at
home raising your son.

44:38.131 --> 44:39.131
Joanna.

44:39.132 --> 44:40.600
I love you.

44:40.601 --> 44:41.769
Don't do this.

44:43.704 --> 44:47.040
I'll let you know when dinner's ready.

45:00.053 --> 45:02.990
Look I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

45:05.926 --> 45:06.760
Joanna.

45:08.529 --> 45:09.362
Come on.

45:20.941 --> 45:22.943
Look I said I was sorry.

45:26.246 --> 45:27.080
Joanna.

45:29.450 --> 45:32.119
Look I'm not gonna cheat on you.

45:33.186 --> 45:34.087
I love you.

45:35.222 --> 45:38.458
I've just been distracted lately.

45:38.459 --> 45:42.362
You're so certain about all that,
then why haven't we set a date?

45:43.831 --> 45:44.665
When?

45:52.440 --> 45:53.673
Look I know, okay.

45:53.674 --> 45:54.842
I'm sorry too.

45:56.043 --> 45:57.910
I don't know why it bothered me so much.

45:57.911 --> 46:01.914
I, I could hear myself yelling at you,

46:01.915 --> 46:04.251
and it wasn't even sure why.

46:05.252 --> 46:07.488
I just feel so overwhelmed.

46:11.625 --> 46:13.561
What are you reading?

46:15.328 --> 46:17.797
It's a book I found in the apartment.

46:17.798 --> 46:19.098
I think it's someone's journal.

46:19.099 --> 46:20.933
Someone who lived here.

46:20.934 --> 46:23.302
Probably shouldn't be reading it.

46:23.303 --> 46:24.571
I know.

46:24.572 --> 46:25.973
But I can't stop.

46:29.677 --> 46:31.011
Anything good?

46:32.713 --> 46:35.515
Not in the way you mean.

46:35.516 --> 46:37.751
What do you think I mean?

46:41.154 --> 46:42.222
Jeff don't.

46:43.190 --> 46:44.357
Oh, come on.

46:47.027 --> 46:48.227
It's been a while.

46:48.228 --> 46:50.129
Okay, seriously.

46:50.130 --> 46:53.800
I'm trying to actually have
a conversation with you,

46:53.801 --> 46:56.737
and all you want to do is have sex.

46:58.271 --> 47:00.373
Is that all I'm good for?

47:28.869 --> 47:29.703
Jeff.

48:00.568 --> 48:02.235
Your baby is mine.

48:40.173 --> 48:41.008
Jeff.

48:43.210 --> 48:44.044
Wake up.

48:45.312 --> 48:46.146
Wake up.

48:49.082 --> 48:50.049
What time is it?

48:50.050 --> 48:51.017
It's early.

48:51.018 --> 48:52.920
Why was I on the couch?

48:55.255 --> 48:56.255
I don't know.

48:56.256 --> 48:57.925
I couldn't wake you.

48:58.859 --> 49:01.429
Who moved it across the room?

49:04.064 --> 49:04.898
You did.

49:06.867 --> 49:08.400
Why?

49:08.401 --> 49:10.236
I don't know.

49:10.237 --> 49:11.904
It's before we had sex.

49:11.905 --> 49:12.740
What?

49:14.575 --> 49:15.875
What?

49:15.876 --> 49:17.243
You don't remember.

49:17.244 --> 49:18.678
Don't touch me.

49:18.679 --> 49:19.912
What?

49:19.913 --> 49:21.581
You had sex with me while I was asleep.

49:21.582 --> 49:23.182
What's wrong with you.

49:23.183 --> 49:24.584
You weren't asleep.

49:24.585 --> 49:25.585
You initiated it.

49:25.586 --> 49:26.920
I was exhausted.

49:30.991 --> 49:32.925
I had a dream you cheated on me

49:32.926 --> 49:35.262
with the woman in the photo.

49:36.396 --> 49:38.065
With a dead woman?

49:39.066 --> 49:40.266
It's not funny.

49:40.267 --> 49:41.834
I'm mad.

49:41.835 --> 49:43.636
I didn't do anything.

49:43.637 --> 49:45.138
You need to relax.

49:46.039 --> 49:47.708
I don't feel good.

49:51.211 --> 49:54.481
I think you should take it easy today.

49:54.482 --> 49:55.883
Maybe go outside.

50:16.970 --> 50:17.805
Outside.

50:21.642 --> 50:24.545
Why are you still standing there?

50:29.349 --> 50:32.019
Have you not moved since I left?

50:32.886 --> 50:33.721
I.

50:57.611 --> 50:59.479
Who moved the couch?

50:59.480 --> 51:00.914
You did.

52:12.319 --> 52:13.319
That's it.

52:13.320 --> 52:15.155
I'll call the manager.

52:50.524 --> 52:51.825
Hello.

52:53.927 --> 52:54.762
Hello.

52:56.430 --> 52:57.464
Hello?

52:57.465 --> 52:58.799
Hello.

53:01.101 --> 53:02.702
Hello.

55:12.866 --> 55:14.201
Hello.

55:26.013 --> 55:27.379
Hello.

55:27.380 --> 55:28.716
Hello.

55:30.884 --> 55:33.285
You're baby's mine.

55:36.323 --> 55:37.157
Porter.

57:02.275 --> 57:03.777
What's the matter?

57:07.848 --> 57:09.816
TV thing's gonna work out.

57:09.817 --> 57:12.820
Okay, well that's great, isn't it?

57:14.955 --> 57:17.156
Schedule conflict?

57:17.157 --> 57:18.725
No, that was fixed.

57:18.726 --> 57:21.061
Well then congratulations.

57:23.497 --> 57:25.765
I lost the film role.

57:25.766 --> 57:26.966
Why?

57:26.967 --> 57:28.234
Someone called the producer

57:28.235 --> 57:31.370
and told them that I was an alcoholic
and I was difficult to work with.

57:31.371 --> 57:33.040
Who would do that?

57:36.777 --> 57:39.011
They said it was a woman.

57:39.012 --> 57:40.848
Are you accusing me?

57:43.717 --> 57:44.917
No.

57:44.918 --> 57:46.587
It sounds like it.

57:49.523 --> 57:51.123
Well who else would it be?

57:51.124 --> 57:52.358
Well I don't know.

57:52.359 --> 57:54.093
Maybe your friend, Alex.

57:54.094 --> 57:55.728
Alex tried to get me the
role in the first place.

57:55.729 --> 57:57.396
She's been on my side
since the beginning.

57:57.397 --> 57:59.132
And I haven't been?

58:06.339 --> 58:07.940
No, you.

58:11.512 --> 58:13.680
How long has this been going on?

58:13.681 --> 58:15.749
Just happens sometimes.

58:16.650 --> 58:17.885
That's crazy.

58:18.819 --> 58:19.986
Hey.

58:19.987 --> 58:20.821
Shut up.

58:27.227 --> 58:30.797
I just don't understand why someone
called the producer like that.

58:33.867 --> 58:36.103
What the hell do they want?

58:38.305 --> 58:39.439
I don't like it here.

58:39.440 --> 58:42.008
I feel like I'm going crazy.

58:42.009 --> 58:42.943
I'll say.

58:43.811 --> 58:46.480
I mean here in this apartment.

58:53.554 --> 58:54.387
Shut up.

59:08.669 --> 59:11.171
Are you going to be alright?

59:12.272 --> 59:15.375
Really sorry you didn't get that role.

59:17.310 --> 59:18.311
It's late.

59:19.713 --> 59:22.049
I think my agent can fix it.

59:23.216 --> 59:25.819
I'm just gonna go get some sleep.

59:27.655 --> 59:29.255
You look sick.

59:29.256 --> 59:30.758
I feel terrible.

59:34.928 --> 59:36.996
You gonna come?

59:36.997 --> 59:37.831
No.

59:39.032 --> 59:42.334
I'm going to stay up and read a bit.

59:42.335 --> 59:43.803
Okay.

59:43.804 --> 59:45.404
What's this?

59:45.405 --> 59:46.239
Hmm?

59:47.975 --> 59:50.009
This blanket.

01:00:03.757 --> 01:00:04.757
Morgan just called.

01:00:04.758 --> 01:00:05.958
What?

01:00:05.959 --> 01:00:09.530
There's still a chance
I can get this part.

01:00:18.839 --> 01:00:20.339
I can't take it anymore.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.609
George won't even speak to me.

01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:24.577
He just yells.

01:00:24.578 --> 01:00:26.479
He blames me for the death of our baby.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.148
But it is his fault.

01:00:29.149 --> 01:00:31.083
His fault I had to run next door

01:00:31.084 --> 01:00:32.752
because of his affair.

01:00:32.753 --> 01:00:34.454
His fault I had to leave her alone.

01:00:34.455 --> 01:00:36.456
His fault I was so distracted

01:00:36.457 --> 01:00:39.091
that I left her alone with the razor,

01:00:39.092 --> 01:00:40.861
and she swallowed it.

01:00:42.563 --> 01:00:44.898
I will poison him.

01:00:45.799 --> 01:00:47.366
I have put cyanide in the sugar,

01:00:47.367 --> 01:00:48.601
and mixed it with his coffee

01:00:48.602 --> 01:00:50.670
for the last two weeks.

01:00:50.671 --> 01:00:52.472
Soon he will be dead.

01:00:52.473 --> 01:00:54.041
And I will be free.

01:00:55.676 --> 01:00:56.677
Oh my god.

01:01:19.266 --> 01:01:20.467
Please work, please, please.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:21.735
Please stop it.

01:01:36.383 --> 01:01:37.217
Shut up.

01:01:59.973 --> 01:02:00.974
Please stop.

01:02:02.409 --> 01:02:03.243
Stop it.

01:02:12.653 --> 01:02:14.422
What are you doing?

01:02:15.723 --> 01:02:17.457
I thought you went out.

01:02:17.458 --> 01:02:19.125
Listen, I don't have time
for your shit today, okay.

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:20.259
I'm exhausted.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:21.595
I told you that.

01:02:23.163 --> 01:02:25.164
What are you doing anyway?

01:02:25.165 --> 01:02:27.900
The drains clogged so I
called the manager, and.

01:02:27.901 --> 01:02:29.268
It's not clogged.

01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:31.271
You have the stopper in.

01:02:35.175 --> 01:02:38.478
What the hell's going on with you?

01:02:38.479 --> 01:02:41.549
I don't know what's going on, Jeff.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:43.817
You're tired.

01:02:44.985 --> 01:02:47.219
I think maybe we should
call your sister.

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.589
I couldn't even use the
phone to call the manager,

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:52.925
because it's broken like
everything else in this apartment.

01:02:52.926 --> 01:02:54.495
This again, okay.

01:02:56.163 --> 01:02:59.566
I think, maybe you should
take some sleeping pills.

01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:02.002
So now you want to drug me?

01:03:04.037 --> 01:03:06.338
You need the rest.

01:03:06.339 --> 01:03:08.174
You'll be fine.

01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:09.009
Trust me.

01:03:11.344 --> 01:03:13.279
You're not listening to me Jeff.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.181
I'm done listening.

01:03:15.182 --> 01:03:17.750
You keep me up every
night with your cleaning.

01:03:17.751 --> 01:03:20.086
And your moving around furniture.

01:03:20.087 --> 01:03:22.422
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:24.424
Why do you think people
are banging on the walls?

01:03:24.425 --> 01:03:26.359
You're keeping them up.

01:03:27.828 --> 01:03:30.196
I don't get up and move
the furniture around.

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:31.197
It's not me.

01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:32.198
Bullshit.

01:03:32.199 --> 01:03:33.033
Enough.

01:03:40.974 --> 01:03:44.911
I don't, I don't want
to stay here tonight.

01:03:44.912 --> 01:03:47.347
I don't know what's going on.

01:03:53.053 --> 01:03:54.286
We'll figure it out
in the morning, okay.

01:03:54.287 --> 01:03:55.121
I'm sorry.

01:03:55.122 --> 01:03:56.389
Just take this.

01:03:57.357 --> 01:03:58.825
Just take it.

01:03:58.826 --> 01:04:00.292
Just take it.

01:04:00.293 --> 01:04:01.128
Please.

01:04:02.996 --> 01:04:04.764
You need rest.

01:04:04.765 --> 01:04:05.599
Come on.

01:04:10.804 --> 01:04:11.639
Okay.

01:04:15.208 --> 01:04:17.144
That's good, now sleep.

01:04:20.213 --> 01:04:22.114
All the anger and rage I have hidden

01:04:22.115 --> 01:04:24.751
since the baby died came out.

01:04:24.752 --> 01:04:25.586
He's gone.

01:04:26.954 --> 01:04:28.722
But the hate remains.

01:04:29.923 --> 01:04:33.426
Try as I might, I cannot
remember what happened.

01:04:33.427 --> 01:04:35.862
I awoke and found him dead.

01:04:35.863 --> 01:04:39.533
And I know that it was
I who had killed him.

01:04:40.701 --> 01:04:43.135
The blood covered the
wall of the nursery.

01:04:43.136 --> 01:04:44.437
The two cops who visited

01:04:44.438 --> 01:04:47.273
when the baby had died
said they'd return.

01:04:47.274 --> 01:04:49.676
I had to do something.

01:04:49.677 --> 01:04:51.878
I cleaned it as best I could.

01:04:51.879 --> 01:04:53.880
But it was no use.

01:04:53.881 --> 01:04:55.883
I had to hide the stain.

01:04:58.118 --> 01:04:59.786
He is gone and I am still here

01:04:59.787 --> 01:05:02.088
in this awful place,

01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:05.458
with my baby dead, I
have nothing to live for.

01:05:05.459 --> 01:05:07.560
My punishment is to remain here, alone.

01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:08.395
Forever.

01:05:11.164 --> 01:05:13.032
I will never leave.

01:05:13.033 --> 01:05:14.968
Never leave this place.

01:05:16.369 --> 01:05:17.805
Never have peace.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:20.808
I am resolved.

01:05:22.676 --> 01:05:24.678
I must take my own life.

01:05:37.691 --> 01:05:38.526
Look.

01:05:51.439 --> 01:05:52.773
Did you read it?

01:05:54.307 --> 01:05:55.142
Yeah.

01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:58.145
So what?

01:05:59.947 --> 01:06:00.781
So what?

01:06:01.915 --> 01:06:03.650
Jeff someone was murdered here.

01:06:03.651 --> 01:06:05.151
She killed him in that room,

01:06:05.152 --> 01:06:07.488
and then she killed herself.

01:06:10.624 --> 01:06:12.793
How does that affect us?

01:06:14.595 --> 01:06:16.764
How does that affect us?

01:06:18.832 --> 01:06:19.667
Yeah?

01:06:21.168 --> 01:06:23.437
I think she's still here.

01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:27.307
Listen, that's crazy.

01:06:29.843 --> 01:06:30.678
I'm here.

01:06:32.012 --> 01:06:33.413
I'll protect you.

01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:36.784
You need to go to sleep.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.767
I'm so tired.

01:07:12.453 --> 01:07:14.622
Please get me out of here.

01:07:35.042 --> 01:07:35.876
Jeff.

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:12.270
I know you're in there.

01:09:12.272 --> 01:09:13.106
Open up.

01:11:05.953 --> 01:11:06.787
Jeff.

01:11:10.357 --> 01:11:11.691
Jeff, is that you?

01:11:11.692 --> 01:11:14.260
Who the fuck is Jeff?

01:11:14.261 --> 01:11:15.294
Who are you?

01:11:15.295 --> 01:11:16.563
Where you been?

01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:17.930
You think you just go
out any time of night?

01:11:17.931 --> 01:11:19.832
Where is Porter?

01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:21.400
Where's Porter?

01:11:21.401 --> 01:11:22.602
Who the fuck is Porter?

01:11:22.603 --> 01:11:24.437
Who's Jeff, you little slut?

01:11:24.438 --> 01:11:26.405
What have you done with my baby?

01:11:26.406 --> 01:11:27.406
It was an accident.

01:11:27.407 --> 01:11:28.641
I told you that.

01:11:28.642 --> 01:11:29.842
How many times do I have to tell?

01:11:29.843 --> 01:11:30.678
Porter!

01:11:31.679 --> 01:11:32.945
Are you fucking mental.

01:11:32.946 --> 01:11:34.647
It's been almost a year.

01:11:34.648 --> 01:11:36.149
I'll the police.

01:11:42.355 --> 01:11:44.356
Enough of this shit.

01:11:44.357 --> 01:11:47.694
I'm gonna teach you a lesson
you won't forget so quick.

01:11:47.695 --> 01:11:49.462
My fiance's gonna be home any minute.

01:11:49.463 --> 01:11:52.232
I'm your husband, you dumb slut.

01:11:54.067 --> 01:11:56.403
I'm sick of your crazy shit.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.675
The baby is dead.

01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:04.377
Get over it already.

01:13:28.829 --> 01:13:29.663
Porter.

01:13:31.298 --> 01:13:32.132
Porter.

01:13:33.366 --> 01:13:34.434
Come on.

01:13:34.435 --> 01:13:35.568
Please.

01:13:35.569 --> 01:13:37.237
Let me in you bitch.

01:16:34.982 --> 01:16:35.816
I'm sorry.

01:16:39.086 --> 01:16:40.187
I'm so sorry.

01:17:18.158 --> 01:17:21.328
Hello, we're here to see the sublet.

01:17:25.633 --> 01:17:26.833
Hello.

01:17:26.834 --> 01:17:28.168
Is anyone there?

01:17:35.075 --> 01:17:37.478
I don't think anyone's there.

01:17:55.328 --> 01:17:56.163
Hello.

01:17:57.931 --> 01:17:58.766
