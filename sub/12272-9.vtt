00:18.600 --> 00:22.100
 Hey, bro, I'm driving drunk,
  and you're lighting up a J?

00:22.100 --> 00:24.600
 Maybe we should wait
   for those... hell, dude.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.100
 Man, we're in Vegas.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.900
  Sweet potato Vegas!

00:29.900 --> 00:31.700
 Whoo!

00:54.200 --> 00:56.300
Hide that!
Hide it! Hide it!

00:56.900 --> 00:57.700
Get it out of here!

01:03.200 --> 01:06.900
Hey, hide that liquor!
hÑ   Hide the liquor! Hide it!

01:06.900 --> 01:08.600
 Throw that joint out!

01:10.600 --> 01:13.100
Get him! Get him!

01:13.200 --> 01:15.300
   Shoot him! Shoot him!

02:25.800 --> 02:27.000
  Get out of the way!

02:55.900 --> 02:56.800
Hello?

02:58.500 --> 02:59.400
Hello?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.500
 Unknown caller. No call list.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.600
 Probably disposable.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.200
   Where's Warrick?

03:25.300 --> 03:26.900
We've been calling him. 
  There's no answer.

03:27.000 --> 03:27.900
See what happens
 when you get in

03:27.900 --> 03:29.600
  a high-speed chase
 with a garbage truck

03:29.600 --> 03:31.500
and end up with <i>two</i> dead bodies.

03:32.700 --> 03:33.700
Where's the other one?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.700
   I take it
   he came out of the truck?

03:38.900 --> 03:39.800
He <i>flew</i> out.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.900
At least that's what
  every eyewitness tells us.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.300
Well, city landfill is a couple
of miles down the road.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.300
  What's the TOD, David?

03:46.300 --> 03:47.500
Nine, maybe ten, hours.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.000
I got no ID on
either of the bodies.

03:49.000 --> 03:49.900
  No ID on the truck.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.800
I ran the VIN number
and the plates.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.400
They're not
in the system.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.300
Good luck.

03:55.900 --> 03:56.800
  Control Sanitation

03:56.800 --> 03:58.600
   is the only waste company
   in Vegas.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.100
If the garbageman works
 for them, his prints

04:00.100 --> 04:01.200
 would be in
 the system.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.400
 All right. Catherine,
   you and I got the bodies.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.600
  Greg, since Warrick's MIA,
  you have a choice:

04:05.600 --> 04:07.400
the truck or the trail.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.700
  I'll go for the fresh air.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.600
Do I get
  a choice, too?

04:11.600 --> 04:12.800
Because, if you don't mind,

04:13.000 --> 04:14.300
I'm going to take
the garbageman.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.200
Be my guest.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.399
 I thought I told you
 not to call me on this line.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.100
 Maybe that's because
 I don't want to talk to you.

04:24.700 --> 04:25.900
  Are you kidding me?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.200
 Why don't you ask the father
 of your unborn child?

04:30.500 --> 04:32.600
  No. That's stupid.
Don't call the lawyers.

04:32.700 --> 04:35.500
Tina, don't call... Tina! Tina!

04:35.600 --> 04:37.100
  Don't call... Tina!

04:38.500 --> 04:39.600
   Damn it.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.400
Hey, Gris, I'm sorry I'm late.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.800
  I had some business
   to take care of.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.300
This <i>is</i> your business.

04:53.900 --> 04:54.800
You were first up.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.700
That means you're supposed
to be here first.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.100
You get to process
the trash truck.

04:59.200 --> 04:59.900
No problem.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.300
  But get it off the street.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.800
  Tow it to the impound yard.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.400

05:54.600 --> 05:56.100
These coveralls are brand-new.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.100
 Your garbageman

06:00.100 --> 06:01.500
was in excellent shape.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.900
COD is as expected.

06:02.900 --> 06:06.500
Massive BFT due to his
unfortunate collision
with the T-bird.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.600
And your other vic
was in his late 20s.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.200
He was definitely
crushed by something.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.600
 Most likely,
the garbage compactor.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.600
  Which happened postmortem.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.900
  Oh, it's always better to be compacted dead
  rather than alive.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.400
Suffocation. He had
petechial hemorrhaging.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.000
 I found white fibers
in the nose and mouth.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.200
Sent them
over to Hodges.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.300
He called back,
confirmed they were silk.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.400
   I tried to trace
   garbageman's cell phone.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.000
Like we expected,
it's disposable.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.600
So I tracked down
the distributor.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.400
It was paid for in cash
  under a bogus name.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.700
   But I did get an AFIS hit
off his print.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.100
   Brody Biggs. Former cop.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.300
When was this taken?

06:52.500 --> 06:55.200
1975, police academy graduation.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.700
   I contacted LVPD.
  They said he quit the force

06:57.700 --> 06:59.800
 back in 1980
with a perfect record.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.000
 Then what?

07:01.300 --> 07:03.800
Social came back to several
different garages around town.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.700
  He was a freelance mechanic
 for 20 years.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.600
 All right, we got to get
his personnel file.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.400
 What about the other vic?

07:09.800 --> 07:11.400
It's Jason Crewes.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.500
 27. Got a hit
  off his work card.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.100
  He's worked at five
   different casinos

07:15.100 --> 07:16.500
   over the last six years.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.100
Well, it doesn't look like
Jason planned on going anywhere.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.300
  I know a lot of people
  in this phone.

07:29.900 --> 07:30.800
  You do not.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.200
  Knows some
  famous people.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.000
Or uses famous nicknames
for his friends.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.799
 Did you see anything?

09:39.100 --> 09:39.800
Nick!

09:43.000 --> 09:44.600
 I think I just found
 ground zero.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.000
  I think Jason
was killed here.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.200
<i>Well, this would have been</i>
   <i>the perfect murder</i>

10:06.200 --> 10:07.100
  if Jason's body would have

10:07.100 --> 10:09.100
   actually made it
   to the landfill.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.800
 Would have been incinerated.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.400
At least now his mother
 has someone to bury.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.400
 <i>He was alone last night.</i>

10:17.300 --> 10:19.200
We talked at about 3:00
in the morning.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.500
 He said he got off work early
 and was going to bed,

10:23.200 --> 10:24.600
   and he'd call me
   when he woke up.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.400
 But he never did.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.200
Have you ever seen this man?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.200
His name is Brody Biggs.
He's a mechanic.

10:35.100 --> 10:35.900
 Are you sure?

10:36.900 --> 10:38.500
We think this is the man
that killed your son.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.200
 If he's a mechanic,

10:41.800 --> 10:44.200
maybe he worked
   on some of Jason's limos.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.200
I thought Jason
   was a club owner.

10:46.700 --> 10:49.700
He was a limo driver
 before that, long time ago.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.300
Well, couldn't be
that long ago.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.900
Jason was only 27.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.700
You have to be 25
to be a limo driver.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.600
 He had all kinds of fake IDs.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
 Drove his first
 long one at 18.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.900
   The owner of the limo
   company liked Jason.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.200
  Made him a VIP driver.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.600
 Celebs liked Jason.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.000
   He could take his clients
 to a Motel 6

11:16.000 --> 11:17.900
  and it'd be
   the hottest spot in town.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.800
 it Wasn't long before the club
   owners invested in Jason,

11:23.700 --> 11:26.900
   made him a group partner,
gave him his own spot.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.200
 Then two, then five.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.000
Suddenly, he's running
 the whole club scene.

11:35.900 --> 11:39.700
 I guess I should say
he <i>ran</i> the club scene.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.400
 He's not going to be running
   anything anymore.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.800
I'll be damned.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.700
   Look at that.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.300
  The good old days.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.200
 Yeah.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.700
Here's an ad for the Silver
Slipper Casino-- buffet.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.800
 Back when they had real
eggs, not powdered ones.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.300
Hey, Gris, listen.
About me being late...

12:12.300 --> 12:14.500
   You have a cell phone
 paid for by the department.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.700
   You call, you say
you're running late.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.000
 What's going on
   with you?

12:19.800 --> 12:21.200
   I don't know. This, uh...

12:21.600 --> 12:24.200
 This whole divorce has taken
   the wind out of my sails.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.100
You know, I used
to have the team

12:26.100 --> 12:27.400
 to distract me from all this,

12:27.400 --> 12:30.100
but even that's changed
 with Sara being gone.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.200
 I feel kind of disconnected.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.300
 You've got your work.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.100
 Don't screw that up.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.700
Van Halen, <i>1984.</i>

13:00.300 --> 13:01.900
   Either this truck was
  delivering merchandise

13:01.900 --> 13:04.500
 for a memorabilia store
 or it's just plain old.

13:04.900 --> 13:07.400
Maybe that's why Brass couldn't find 
the registration record.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.200
 These old blue license plates
   were issued in the '80s.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.600
  I don't think this truck's
  been on the streets since.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.300
 I think this guy was
 disguising his truck.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.400
 It was orange
 before it was green.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.300
They used to use orange
  garbage trucks in the '80s.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.600
   The hydraulic
  cylinder blew.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.600
<i>Maybe when he crushed the body.</i>

14:08.300 --> 14:11.000
Found this .22 in the
parking lot near the crash.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.300
 Check these bullets.

14:14.000 --> 14:14.700
Shorts.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.500
 Usually used
  for shooting small animals,

14:16.500 --> 14:18.500
   but in some cases
they're used on people

14:18.500 --> 14:19.700
in place of a silencer.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.300
 <i>Less gunpowder, less noise.</i>

14:22.100 --> 14:23.400
   <i>Look, if the garbageman</i>
 <i>had this gun,</i>

14:23.400 --> 14:24.500
  why didn't he just
shoot the vic?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.600
He found Jason sleeping.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.200
 Why make a mess
   if you don't have to?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.100
Sounds le a
professional hit man.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.000
Well, if he was,

14:30.600 --> 14:32.400
we still have to find the guy who hired him.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.500
???  truck back to The Regency,

14:37.500 --> 14:38.700
   the company that made it.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.700
 The only model of that truck
sold in Nevada

14:40.700 --> 14:44.000
was to a company called
  The Regal Sanitation Group.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.300
They shut down in '83.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.200
 That explains the garbage.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.900
  Regal Sanitation was owned
  by Anthony Pezzulo.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.500
   I'm studying mob history
 for my book.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.300
Pezzulo? Wasn't he the mob boss
who owned the Starfly?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.400
<i>SANDERS:
They called Pezzulo "Whacko,"</i>

15:01.400 --> 15:03.500
<i>not so much for his
wacky personality</i>

15:03.500 --> 15:05.300
as for his love
for whacking guys.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.100
<i>GRISSOM:
Until he himself</i>

15:08.100 --> 15:10.900
got whacked at
the  onsin Dells in 1983.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.600
I.
Every mob-owned business
in Vegas shut down

15:13.600 --> 15:14.900
when Pezzulo died.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.500
These scumbags lay roaches.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.600
Just when you think
they're gone,

15:17.600 --> 15:18.900
they pop back up again.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.300
Somebody put a hit
out on Jason.

15:21.700 --> 15:22.700
It couldn't have been Pezzulo

15:22.700 --> 15:24.300
'cause he's been dead
for 20 years.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.600
Pezzulo's wife Kate got rid
of Regal Sanitation

15:26.600 --> 15:27.900
right after he died.

15:27.900 --> 15:28.800
She still around?

15:29.200 --> 15:30.500
She fell off the radar.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.500
All I could find
was this old photo.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.400
<i>WOMAN:
I told you the truth.</i>

15:36.700 --> 15:38.200
You lied about your name.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.000
The feds told me to forget
I ever had the Pezzulo name.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.900
I wasn't about
to remember it for you.

15:45.300 --> 15:48.000
My husband had more cops
than capos on his payroll.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.200
So you went into
witness protection.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.400
You changed your identity.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.400
And then you stayed
in Vegas?

15:53.400 --> 15:55.900
Feds felt we'd actually
be safer here.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.400
They thought if we left,
we might

15:58.400 --> 16:01.400
suffer the same consequences
as Anthony.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.900
BRASS:
Did Jason have any mob ties?

16:06.800 --> 16:10.100
Jason was three years old
when Anthony died.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.000
He never even knew his father.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.300
The last time we talked you said
you didn't know Jason's killer.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.400
What about this guy?

16:26.100 --> 16:27.100
That's B.B.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.600
That's the same guy.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.300
B.B. is short for Brody Biggs.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.200
B.B. didn't kill Jason.

16:35.900 --> 16:36.900
There's no way.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.200
He was Anthony's friend.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.800
Friend?

16:43.900 --> 16:47.200
B.B. was driving one of your
husband's old garbage trucks.

16:48.300 --> 16:51.300
Your dead son was in the back
with the rest of the garbage.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.900
How did B.B.
get the truck?

16:59.800 --> 17:02.500
I haven't seen.B. in 23 years.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.300
You got rid
of the business.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.200
What happened
to the trucks?

17:07.400 --> 17:09.300
I gave that stuff to Lou Gedda.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.599
The owner of
Pigalle Boulevard
Strip Club.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.200
????

17:16.000 --> 17:19.900
Of course, they were both
on Anthony's crew,e

17:19.900 --> 17:21.000
but they would never...

17:21.000 --> 17:21.900
Never what?

17:23.700 --> 17:25.000
Never kill your son

17:25.000 --> 17:27.500
and dispose of him in one
of the trucks you gave him?

17:32.500 --> 17:34.000
When was the last time
you saw Gedda?

17:37.600 --> 17:42.000
I haven't had any contact
with him since Anthony died.

17:42.700 --> 17:43.600
So you're telling me

17:43.600 --> 17:46.300
you haven't seen or spoken
to Lou Gedda in 23 years?

17:50.200 --> 17:51.900
Gedda and I had an agreement.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.200
He was to keep away
from our family.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.800
Forget Jason and I ever existed.

18:03.100 --> 18:06.900
Obviously, Lou Gedda is not
a man of his word.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.300
This place has always
been bad news.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.300
My guys are in here
at least twice a week.

18:26.300 --> 18:27.500
Yet there's always a line.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.000
Never underestimate
the power of the ass.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.600
Looking for Lou Gedda.

19:35.900 --> 19:36.900
MAN:
Yeah, come on in.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.200
Who let you two up here?

19:44.500 --> 19:46.000
Just so I know
who to fire.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.000
Gold card.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.500
Oh, yeah, those seem
to work everywhere.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.300
Got to get me one.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.300
Ahh...!

19:59.500 --> 20:00.800
I know why you're here.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.800
And I don't know
what to say.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.900
I can't control these girls.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.100
They want to leave
with customers

20:07.100 --> 20:09.700
and do whatever it is
they do, I can't prevent that.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.500
Believe me,
I don't like whores.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.800
I like dancers.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.100
When I find out they're whores,
I kick them curbside.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.800
We're not here
about your girls.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.200
We're here about this guy.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.100
B.B.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.900
Yeah, works
at my auto detailing.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.300
But I tell ya,
he's in here more,

20:27.300 --> 20:30.300
getting drunk and checking out
the breast-est-es.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.200
Well, you don't have
to worry about him
anymore. He's dead.

20:32.700 --> 20:35.000
Oh. Well...

20:36.100 --> 20:37.800
unless you invite me
to the funeral,

20:37.800 --> 20:39.000
what's this got
to do with me?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.800
Tell me about
Jason Crewes.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.600
He brings me boatloads
of celebrities,

20:42.600 --> 20:44.100
which equals
boatloads of money.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.000
I love the kid.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.400
Oh, don't tell me.

20:49.300 --> 20:50.900
You think Jason killed B.B.?

20:51.800 --> 20:53.400
We think B.B. killed Jason.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.300
Now, see, that
makes more sense.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.800
When is the last time
you saw Jason Crewes, sir?

21:00.100 --> 21:01.000
Last week.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.100
How long have
u known him?

21:02.100 --> 21:03.400
A couple years at most.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.800
I still don't understand
what this has to do with me.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.100
You missing a garbage truck?

21:08.500 --> 21:09.400
Go again?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.000
Regal Sanitation Group.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.600
Your buddy Pezzulo's
old company.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.400
Yoinrited
the trucks.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.800
So what?

21:15.800 --> 21:18.800
Jason Crewes' corpse flew
out of one of your trucks

21:18.800 --> 21:19.700
earlier this morning.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.500
Do you kno yhow much this club
made last year?

21:21.500 --> 21:22.600
30 mill.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.800
You think I'm still messing
around with trash?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.600
And that's
the end of this.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.700
You want to continue
asking me questions,

21:28.700 --> 21:30.200
U ????do it With my ???

22:09.100 --> 22:10.300
BROWN:
Here you go.
Thank you.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.400
So you're the talented
Mr. Raykirk,

22:12.400 --> 22:13.500
agent to the stars.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.600
Uh-uh, manager.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.000
What's
the difference?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.400
Uh, well, an agent
gets ten percent

22:19.400 --> 22:21.000
and a manager gets 15.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.500
Listen, I'm here in town
for a film festival

22:24.500 --> 22:25.500
and I have to get
to a screening,

22:25.500 --> 22:28.500
so you can you just, you know,
cut to the chase?

22:30.300 --> 22:31.800
Jason Crewes is dead.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.200
Okay.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.600
Um...
So he took you

22:41.600 --> 22:44.000
to Pigalle Boulevard in August.

22:44.900 --> 22:46.000
Do you remember that?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.100
How do you know about that?

22:47.700 --> 22:48.700
I'm an investigator.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.700
Some things I do know, but
there's a lot that I don't.

22:52.300 --> 22:53.700
Somebody put a hit
out on your friend.

22:53.700 --> 22:54.800
You want to help us
out here?

22:55.600 --> 22:57.800
I have an agent friend
who I work with

22:57.800 --> 22:59.400
who had a bachelor party
out here,

22:59.400 --> 23:01.900
and Jason hooked us up
VIP-style.

23:05.700 --> 23:09.500
<i>He took us to Moon
and LAX and Drai's</i>

23:09.500 --> 23:11.900
<i>and then of course, naturally,
we ended up at a strip club.</i>

23:12.400 --> 23:15.700
<i>And everyone knows the best
girls are at Pigalle Boulevard.</i>

23:19.000 --> 23:20.900
<i>It couldn't get any better
until the check showed up.</i>

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
Ten grand?

23:24.700 --> 23:25.800
The manager said $800 a bottle.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.100
We ordered five.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.800
I hear you don't want
to pay what you owe us.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.000
No. No, no, no, no.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.800
I just think
you overcharged us, man.

23:34.800 --> 23:35.600
No.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.600
This place is a rip-off.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.000
And your girls?

23:41.000 --> 23:44.800
They're beat, overrated,
and oversized.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.100
Get it?

23:46.100 --> 23:47.300
I'm not paying.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.200
Let's take a walk.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.700
I'm gonna give you
a minute

24:02.000 --> 24:03.900
so you can figure out
what you want to do.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.300
I'm cutting something.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.700
But I'm gonna give you the
choice of what it's gonna be.

24:09.700 --> 24:10.700
No.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.200
I can slice you here

24:12.500 --> 24:14.000
or I can slice you here.

24:14.700 --> 24:15.700
(sobbing)
Come on, no, no, no.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.400
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

24:17.800 --> 24:18.800
Come on, you choose.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.000
I mean, I was never
more scared in my life.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.800
You know, he was so sweet enough
to give me the choice

24:22.800 --> 24:25.600
of my throat or my genitals,
so I chose the latter...

24:25.700 --> 24:26.800
so I'd live.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.800
Then he charged my card

24:28.800 --> 24:30.900
and escorted us out
to the parking lot.

24:31.500 --> 24:32.500
Oh, here's something
really cool.

24:32.500 --> 24:35.000
I left with a broken nose,
some sore wrists,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.900
and some really nice bruises
underneath my arms.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.000
And I just should've given him
the ten grand

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
because I paid
my plastic surgeon twice that.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.000
And you told Jason
about all this?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Oh, yeah.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.100
I mean, he gave this guy Gedda
a call right in front of me.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.800
Then he cursed him out

24:50.300 --> 24:53.000
and he told him he would never
take anyone to Pigalle anymore.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.300
Listen, I'm really sorry
about all this.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.700
But, um, thanks
a lot for your time.
Oh, yeah.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.800
By the way, if you're
gonna prosecute this guy,

25:02.800 --> 25:04.800
I'm not a witness.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.800
There's a reason that
I didn't press charges,

25:06.800 --> 25:07.700
if you know what I mean.

25:29.900 --> 25:31.000
Four shots.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.600
Got an IBIS hit
off that gun.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.200
Unsolved murder in '93.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.300
Victim was found
in the desert.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.300
His car was found
at Pigalle Boulevard,

26:10.300 --> 26:11.600
the last place
anyone saw him.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.100
GRISSOM:
Our hit man's good
for two murders.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.800
The unsolved in '93,
where he actually used a gun,

26:15.900 --> 26:18.000
and Jason Crewes,
who he suffocated.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.800
So, who hired him?

26:19.800 --> 26:21.500
I have a good feeling
he works for Gedda.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.600
Yeah, but we don't work
off feelings, do we?

26:23.600 --> 26:26.600
According to Mr. Hollywood,
Jason cost Gedda a lot of money,

26:26.600 --> 26:28.400
and he dissed him,
which is more than enough

26:28.400 --> 26:30.200
for Gedda to order out
a hit on someone,

26:30.600 --> 26:32.300
even if Jason
is Pezzulo's son.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.400
Any evidence?

26:33.700 --> 26:35.500
I ran Pigalle's address
to find out

26:35.500 --> 26:37.400
if there are any more crimes
linked to it over the years.

26:37.400 --> 26:41.000
I found hundreds:
416s, 413s, 411s...

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
The list goes on.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.400
y consistent suspects?

26:43.400 --> 26:44.400
Only thing consistent

26:44.400 --> 26:46.400
is that the victims refused
to file charges

26:46.400 --> 26:48.400
and the witnesses refused
to give statements.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.500
S.I.d it's funny enough the cops
lost interest in pursuing it.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.400
What are you saying?

26:53.400 --> 26:54.500
I'm saying it looks like Gedda

26:54.500 --> 26:56.000
is running an old school
extortion racket,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.600
and you can't do that without
having cops on the payroll.

27:44.200 --> 27:44.900
Hey!

27:46.300 --> 27:47.100
I just want to talk!

27:47.100 --> 27:48.200
I got warrants, man!

27:48.200 --> 27:49.400
I'm not a cop.

27:50.100 --> 27:51.600
I don't care.
You got a piece.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.400
Calm down. I'm not
going to hurt you.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.100
You live here?
Pretty much.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.400
What do you want?

27:56.400 --> 27:57.800
You ever see anybody
get beat up inside?

27:57.800 --> 27:59.500
No, no, I never seen
none of that.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.000
Don't ke me pull
those warrants, man.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.600
Yeah, I seen guys get beat up.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.300
This is Strip Club Strip.

28:04.300 --> 28:05.800
Guys get beat up
and down this block.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.300
You ever see the owner
beat up anyone?

28:07.300 --> 28:09.100
Hey, they let me stay here.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.200
They're real good to me.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.400
I didn't ask you that.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.000
Lot of troublemakers,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.100
they come out of there
and they get hauled off.

28:17.100 --> 28:18.400
That's all I know.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.700
What do you mean
by "hauled off"?

29:25.000 --> 29:25.900
You goa warrant?

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Do I need one?

29:28.700 --> 29:29.800
I ???

29:29.800 --> 29:33.000
Unless you're lookin' to get a
detail job, you're trespassing.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.800
What do you do with this?

29:35.400 --> 29:36.900
I burn meat.

30:13.300 --> 30:14.900
Hey.
Hey.

30:14.900 --> 30:15.700
What's up?

30:16.500 --> 30:19.000
Trying to get this warrant
for Gedda's property.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.200
I'm getting close though.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.200
Check out these
bruise patterns.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.500
Hey, what are those?

30:26.800 --> 30:28.100
What?
Those pills?

30:28.700 --> 30:30.400
Oh, they're supposed
to keep me alert.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.700
Really?
Yeah.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.600
How long you been
taking those?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.800
I don't know,
for a couple months.

30:37.300 --> 30:40.100
Aren't you still taking
those sleeping pills, too?

30:41.100 --> 30:42.100
What's it to you?

30:46.700 --> 30:50.200
So now... you're taking
uppers and downers.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.300
Gimme a break, man.

30:53.100 --> 30:55.200
No, you need to give yourself
a break, Warrick.

30:56.300 --> 30:57.500
Hey, let it go, bro.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.500
No. No, I'm not going
to let it go.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.200
(pills clattering)
What are you doing, man?

31:04.200 --> 31:06.400
You need to take a look
at yourself, Warrick.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.800
And I care
because I'm your ???

31:21.700 --> 31:23.000
All right?
Yeah.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.000
All right, tell me
about these bruises.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
BROWN:
The 415 vic claims he got
beat up inside the Pigalle.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.000
Couple days later, he
dropped all the charges.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.600
And then there's
the unsolved murder.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.400
They find a vic
out in the desert,

31:39.500 --> 31:41.900
but they find his car
outside of Pigalle's.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.200
Same bruise pattern.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.400
Now we got this Hollywood agent

31:45.400 --> 31:48.000
who mentions that he also
has bruises under his arms.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.700
He claims that he was strapped
to a barber's chair

31:51.200 --> 31:52.600
in Gedda's office.

31:52.900 --> 31:54.300
That should be enough
for a warrant.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.200
BRASS:
The judge doesn't think
the bruises are enough

32:01.200 --> 32:03.800
probable cause
to issue a warrant.

32:03.900 --> 32:04.600
BROWN (on phone):
What judge?

32:04.600 --> 32:05.400
Greene.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.500
When I was running bets
for Judge Cohen,

32:07.500 --> 32:08.800
she was in on the action.

32:09.600 --> 32:10.900
I have no comment.

32:10.900 --> 32:13.500
You know, these club owners--
they pay a lot of taxes;

32:13.500 --> 32:16.400
they fund campaigns;
they hand out free drinks,

32:16.400 --> 32:18.200
all in exchange for protection.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.700
I mean, what can I do?

32:20.700 --> 32:23.500
Go to the Undersheriff,
see if he can use his influence.

32:25.000 --> 32:25.900
But I doubt it.

32:36.200 --> 32:36.800
Excuse me.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.200
BROWN:
McKeen!

32:41.800 --> 32:42.900
Excuse me a moment.

32:43.700 --> 32:44.900
Judge denied me
the warrant.

32:44.900 --> 32:46.300
What do you
want me to do?

32:46.300 --> 32:47.400
Get me the warrant.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.800
Lou Gedda is getting
away with murder.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.700
All right, say that
I get you the warrant.

32:50.700 --> 32:51.600
What are you looking for,

32:51.600 --> 32:53.300
something that made
armpit bruises?

32:53.300 --> 32:56.900
The barber's chair in Gedda's
office made the armpit bruises.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.700
I'm agreeing with the judge.

33:00.800 --> 33:01.700
McKEEN:
Grissom!

33:05.300 --> 33:07.100
You need to save
your CSI here.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.700
What he has is
circumstantial

33:08.700 --> 33:11.100
based off of weird bruises
and a barber chair.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.300
Brown needs to get
better evidence

33:13.300 --> 33:15.400
and leave the rest in our hands.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.800
I'm sorry, leave what
in your hands-Gedda's money?

33:22.600 --> 33:23.300
Listen to me.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.200
Putting Gedda in jail is not
gonna solve your problems.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.200
You just got the rest
of the night off.

34:05.300 --> 34:05.900
Hey!
(gasps)

34:07.500 --> 34:08.400
What's in the bag?

34:08.400 --> 34:09.600
All my stuff.

34:10.199 --> 34:11.600
I'm just cleaning out my locker.

34:12.699 --> 34:13.600
Show me.

34:23.100 --> 34:24.400
Here, let me help you with that.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.000
Thanks.

34:37.000 --> 34:37.900
I'm sorry.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.100
What can I get you
tonight?

35:06.100 --> 35:07.800
Got any Dom Perignon?
Mm-hmm.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.400
What about Cristal?
We do.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.300
We also have DP Rose.

35:11.700 --> 35:13.000
I'll take one of each.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.000
Hey...
Hey!

35:47.000 --> 35:48.400
I'm sorry about earlier.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.800
I thought you were carrying a
dead body in there or something.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.200
You're a cop, right?

35:53.800 --> 35:54.800
I'm Warrick Brown.

35:56.000 --> 35:56.800
I'm Candy.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.000
Nice to meet you, Candy.

35:58.300 --> 35:59.300
So, you work here?

36:00.700 --> 36:01.300
Yeah.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.100
What do you want?

36:05.800 --> 36:06.600
Everything.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.100
Hey, cheers, girl.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.100
Hey, let's get out of here,
you and me.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.100
I'm working.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.800
Come on, I just want
to ask you a few questions.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.700
I don't go home
with the customers.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.800
Pay the bill and let's go.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.600
How'd you know I was here?

36:37.600 --> 36:40.400
You've been here twice
already today.y We're leaving.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.500
NE
Come on, Gris,
why don't you sit down ???

36:42.500 --> 36:43.800
I'm on the clock.

36:44.100 --> 36:45.100
So am I.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.900
So you want to get fired.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.100
No, I want to let
them know I'm here.

36:49.100 --> 36:50.700
I figured I'd order
a couple bottles

36:50.700 --> 36:52.400
and not pay for it
and see what happens.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.500
You think he's that stupid?

36:54.500 --> 36:55.400
It's worth a try.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.100
Here you go, sir.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.100
Thank you.

37:04.500 --> 37:05.900
Well, now you gotta
pay for it,

37:06.500 --> 37:08.500
'cause we're not allowed
to accept gifts.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.100
BROWN:
I left my car.

37:10.100 --> 37:11.200
I gotta get my car.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.400
You gotta admit, though,
once I get this done...

37:17.400 --> 37:18.700
Get in the car, Warrick.

37:19.700 --> 37:21.000
???
Go on.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.100
Go home. Sleep it off.FL

37:24.100 --> 37:26.000
I'll see you in my office
in the morning.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.000
Hey... follow that girl.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.400
Thanks.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.300
???

38:42.500 --> 38:43.500
You don't give up.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.600
Not tonight.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.400
Irish whiskey.
Neat.

38:47.300 --> 38:48.600
What's your real name, Candy?

38:49.400 --> 38:51.200
Joanna Krumsky

38:51.300 --> 38:53.600
Joanna.
I'll stick with Candy.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.900
So, now that we're out
of the Pigalle,

38:58.200 --> 38:59.800
you can help me out
with a few questions.

38:59.800 --> 39:00.800
Good luck.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.300
Anybody ever get heavy-handed
with you over there?

39:06.300 --> 39:08.400
Not with me.
I'm a black belt.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.500
Nice.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.000
Not even the owner, Gedda?

39:12.400 --> 39:13.600
Not even him.

39:16.900 --> 39:17.500
Thanks.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.900
So what about the customer?
They ever get beat-downs?

39:25.200 --> 39:28.000
When the guys get drunk
and start groping the girls.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.000
That's not tolerated.

39:30.300 --> 39:32.800
You ever see a barber's chair
in Gedda's office?

39:33.100 --> 39:34.400
No, but I heard
about one.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.200
It's supposed to
be Al Capone's.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.300
Al Capone.

39:37.300 --> 39:38.800
Yeah, but that
has to be a rumor.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.300
Mob guy with
Al Capone's chair--

39:42.100 --> 39:43.300
it's so cliché.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.900
Gedda's like the last
wise guy left in Vegas.

39:45.900 --> 39:48.500
Guess that's his way of
keeping his culture alive.

39:48.500 --> 39:50.200
Scumbags like him
don't have culture.

39:50.200 --> 39:53.000
Scumbags like him
started Vegas.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.800
None of these lights would be
here if it wasn't for them.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.400
What's a hot young thing
like you doing

39:59.400 --> 40:01.000
working in a nasty place
like that?

40:02.000 --> 40:02.800
Money.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.600
The hours.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.400
The dancing.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.800
How about you giving me
that last dance of the evening?

40:14.600 --> 40:15.800
COME HERE ???

40:18.300 --> 40:20.500
WHAT ???

40:20.500 --> 40:21.600
<i>JOANNA:
Relax.</i>

40:21.600 --> 40:22.400
???

40:22.400 --> 40:23.800
It's just for your protection.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.400
???

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
<i>It's just for protection.</i>

40:26.400 --> 40:27.600
OH YEAH

40:32.700 --> 40:34.000
RIGHT ???

40:34.000 --> 40:36.300

42:30.700 --> 42:31.300
Thanks.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.800
No, no, no!
You can't cross the tape!

42:51.800 --> 42:52.700
Not this time.

42:53.600 --> 42:54.800
This is your car.

43:00.400 --> 43:04.200
No! No!

43:05.300 --> 43:06.900
No, this is wrong!

43:06.900 --> 43:08.300
She didn't do anything!
