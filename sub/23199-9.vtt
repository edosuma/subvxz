00:19.319 --> 00:21.863
8.4 on the Richter scale, Prof. Chapman.

00:22.197 --> 00:23.782
I can see it.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.161
Do you think that I can create a volcano
without realizing its power?

00:30.663 --> 00:32.749
8.4.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.836
This is merely a demonstration.

00:37.378 --> 00:40.840
This should give the China-watchers
something to talk about.

00:45.303 --> 00:47.347
And what they don't realize...

00:48.514 --> 00:50.934
is that the real news is yet to come.

01:09.763 --> 01:12.236

01:51.459 --> 01:53.552
***

02:21.786 --> 02:25.212
****

02:48.008 --> 02:49.885
Do you wanna follow me?

02:50.385 --> 02:53.472
Congratulations. I hear
that Atkinson got bumped upstairs...

02:53.555 --> 02:54.681
and you've been promoted.

02:54.765 --> 02:56.933
All my assignments
come from you from now on?

02:57.017 --> 02:59.519
That's right.
Sorry we don't have time for champagne.

02:59.603 --> 03:01.605
I'm here to give you your assignment.

03:01.688 --> 03:04.608
Come on, Steve.
I just got back from the Philippines.

03:04.691 --> 03:06.902
I'm going fishing with some friends
in Arizona.

03:06.985 --> 03:10.030
You're still going fishing.
But I'm afraid not with friends.

03:10.113 --> 03:11.198
Okay.

03:11.656 --> 03:13.867
Where do I fish, and what for?

03:14.743 --> 03:17.537
- See the headlines.
- Chinese volcano?

03:19.539 --> 03:22.667
The Office of Scientific Research
says it shouldn't happen.

03:22.751 --> 03:25.045
Any more questions?
Any more answers?

03:25.128 --> 03:29.257
In exactly 37 minutes, get yourself
some flight insurance at the gift shop.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.092
Look, this is no piece of cake.

03:31.176 --> 03:33.303
Dave Pruett,
the last agent we sent there...

03:33.386 --> 03:35.680
- Yes?
- He hasn't been seen or heard from...

03:35.764 --> 03:39.017
since he checked into Room 7
at the Vista Bonita Hotel.

03:39.309 --> 03:41.186
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

04:35.698 --> 04:38.576
Very beautiful.
Do you know what it is?

04:41.370 --> 04:43.622
Few American-born Chinese do.

04:44.415 --> 04:47.543
Four million of these blocks
were used in the construction...

04:47.626 --> 04:51.672
of the new Great Hall of
the People's Republic of China in Peking.

04:52.214 --> 04:54.091
It's heavy for all its beauty.

04:54.175 --> 04:56.218
The finest wood in Asia...

04:56.552 --> 04:59.388
reinforced with coats of special lacquer.

04:59.972 --> 05:02.308
It has the strength of concrete.

05:02.933 --> 05:06.020
May I present your colleague...

05:06.645 --> 05:08.105
Comrade Ling?

05:09.690 --> 05:10.899
Comrade Ling.

05:14.278 --> 05:17.031
With all due respect to your judgment,
Col. Minh...

05:17.114 --> 05:21.660
an expedition into the rugged sections
of Baja California for one so frail would-

05:39.970 --> 05:41.471
Forgive me, Colonel.

05:44.683 --> 05:47.227
Capitalistic chauvinism, Comrade.

05:48.645 --> 05:50.314
Your report, Mei Ling.

05:50.397 --> 05:54.276
Steve Trevor of the I.A.D.C.
met with one of his agents...

05:54.359 --> 05:56.194
at the Coast Terminal airport.

05:56.278 --> 05:59.948
It is certain that the Americans
are behind the volcano business.

06:00.032 --> 06:02.826
I made sure
that she is being closely Watched.

06:02.909 --> 06:04.369
Need more be said?

06:13.503 --> 06:15.964
Arriving passenger...

06:16.298 --> 06:18.800
please report
to the main information desk.

06:38.528 --> 06:43.450
Flight 123 to Salt Lake City
is noW ready for boarding.

07:00.508 --> 07:04.178
Flight 316 for Mexico City...

07:04.262 --> 07:06.723
is noW boarding at Gate 11.

07:18.234 --> 07:22.905
Flight 121 from Sacramento
is noW arriving at Gate 10.

09:32.826 --> 09:33.994
Hello.

09:34.452 --> 09:36.204
Do you have a reservation?

09:36.287 --> 09:37.539
Do I need one?

09:37.622 --> 09:41.251
- It's peak season. You staying long?
- I'm not sure I'm gonna stay at all.

09:41.334 --> 09:44.879
It doesn't seem like the fish
are exactly jumping around here.

09:44.963 --> 09:47.173
I've got a case of tuna in the back room.

09:47.257 --> 09:50.552
In that case, this must be the place.

09:51.261 --> 09:52.720
Take your pick.

09:52.804 --> 09:53.888
Seven.

09:54.806 --> 09:56.766
- Seven?
- It's my lucky number.

10:01.646 --> 10:03.189
You're in luck.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.317
We just had a cancellation.
A couple of movie stars.

10:06.401 --> 10:08.653
Decided on Puerto Vallarta
for some reason.

10:08.736 --> 10:10.655
Wanna register?
Sure.

10:15.159 --> 10:17.203
Diana Prince.

10:18.579 --> 10:20.832
- Have any luggage?
- In my buggy.

10:21.541 --> 10:23.334
- Buggy?
- Dune buggy.

10:26.504 --> 10:28.840
Señores, número siete, por favor.

10:31.425 --> 10:33.177
If you'll follow me.

10:53.364 --> 10:55.366
Should I look under the bed?

10:55.700 --> 10:59.161
Not unless you want to find something
that isn't registered.

10:59.328 --> 11:02.623
Make yourself comfortable,
and if you need anything...

11:02.706 --> 11:03.791
Yes?

11:03.874 --> 11:06.836
You'll just have to come down
and get it yourself.

11:08.921 --> 11:10.548
Right. I get it.

11:13.509 --> 11:15.010
Thank you very much.

11:18.556 --> 11:20.474
Excuse me. Sorry.

11:23.394 --> 11:25.229
There you go. Thank you.

11:26.730 --> 11:29.108
A perfect example of our room service.

11:29.733 --> 11:31.652
I'll see you in the morning.

11:32.611 --> 11:35.697
Buenas tardes.
Buenas tardes.

12:28.708 --> 12:31.378
You have a visitor. Diana Prince.

12:31.628 --> 12:33.380
That's what I was calling to tell you.

12:33.463 --> 12:35.966
The I.A.D.C. is getting bolder.

12:36.049 --> 12:38.510
They didn't even bother
to change her name.

12:38.593 --> 12:39.886
She's an agent?

12:40.470 --> 12:43.139
Of course. Where did you put her?

12:43.223 --> 12:44.599
Room 7. Same as Pruett.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.040
Get rid of her.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.002
Did you hear me?

13:13.086 --> 13:14.337
I heard you. Only...

13:14.504 --> 13:15.588
Only what?

13:17.423 --> 13:19.258
She's a pretty good-looking lady.

13:20.093 --> 13:21.719
Get rid of her tonight.

13:22.595 --> 13:23.763
Okay.

13:34.482 --> 13:37.109
Looks as though
she's gonna spend the night.

13:37.193 --> 13:40.863
- Perhaps we should check in as well.
- Do you need comfort to do your duty?

13:40.947 --> 13:43.366
I merely thought that a closer look would-

13:43.449 --> 13:46.285
You were thinking
of a roof over your head.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.205
We will sleep in this vehicle.

13:50.206 --> 13:53.876
I will take the first watch.
I will wake you in four hours.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.668
Russia, sir. North of Moscow.

16:02.337 --> 16:06.841
Number two of the three great powers
gets into the act.

16:11.846 --> 16:15.850
I could almost pick the agents
that the Kremlin will send myself.

16:16.935 --> 16:20.146
No word from Diana
since she checked out the dune buggy.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.149
But she did check into the hotel.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.735
Okay. Keep on it.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.904
Got something, Joe?

16:28.237 --> 16:32.116
An analysis of the satellite photos.
Another volcanic eruption.

16:32.575 --> 16:33.743
Where?

16:34.035 --> 16:35.161
U.S.S.R.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.371
Terrific. It was Baja. You heard?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.040
Anything else?

16:39.123 --> 16:42.043
At precisely the time
that the volcano exploded...

16:42.251 --> 16:44.754
a bright light,
some kind of bizarre phenomenon...

16:44.837 --> 16:47.715
lit up the sky
just above the Vista Bonita Hotel.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.800
The beam and the explosion...

16:50.384 --> 16:52.011
lasted 47 seconds.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.514
- The Russians respond yet?
- Immediately. They're sending the twins.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.725
All they have in common
is size and strength.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.102
And tenacity.
Where are they now?

17:00.186 --> 17:03.564
It's anybody's guess.
Two hours ago, they were in Mexico City.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.525
They should be in Baja
by the time the sun comes up.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.212
How they pamper themselves.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.093
- Why didn't you wake me?
- I tried.

17:33.344 --> 17:37.014
And you were afraid
that the rugged terrain will be tiring me.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.771
I didn't realize we were
in a contest with one another.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.444
Prince girl.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.279
Leaving now.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.078
They cannot drive far.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.417
How'd you leave Miss Prince?

18:05.500 --> 18:07.920
- Breathless.
- You witnessed it?

18:08.128 --> 18:09.630
I pushed the button.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.716
Did you expect me
to wait around and watch?

18:13.717 --> 18:17.137
You are not developing a weak stomach,
are you, Corbin?

18:17.346 --> 18:18.722
There are limits.

18:19.681 --> 18:21.683
Your altruism is commendable...

18:22.976 --> 18:24.311
in Boy Scouts.

18:25.854 --> 18:28.398
I'll see that you get a merit badge.

19:39.844 --> 19:41.304
I'll handle this.

19:42.889 --> 19:44.223
You are my prisoner.

19:44.307 --> 19:46.058
You're sadly mistaken, miss.

19:46.142 --> 19:48.394
- You are mine.
- We'll see about that.

20:25.931 --> 20:27.349
Congratulations...

20:28.809 --> 20:30.102
to both of you.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.523
You are a credit to the I.A.D.C.

20:35.232 --> 20:39.403
It's nothing that any other red-blooded
American girl couldn't accomplish.

20:40.571 --> 20:44.491
I'm glad there are no broken bones.
Perhaps you were tired from your vigil.

20:44.575 --> 20:45.951
I have lost face.

20:46.118 --> 20:47.202
Nonsense.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.955
You fought extremely well.

20:50.289 --> 20:53.000
And lost only to a first-class opponent.

20:53.959 --> 20:55.961
Tie her wrists.
Yes, Comrade.

20:59.548 --> 21:03.469
How well-staffed is the facility
at the top of this mountain?

21:05.012 --> 21:06.430
I have no idea.

21:06.680 --> 21:10.434
Look, miss, I warn you, I cannot go on
being polite to an American...

21:10.517 --> 21:13.645
when we all know that the U.S.
is behind this volcano business.

21:13.729 --> 21:16.732
Do you think that I'd be sneaking around
a Mexican mountain...

21:16.815 --> 21:19.109
if the U.S. had anything at all
to do with this?

21:19.192 --> 21:21.320
In the first place,
you two would be arrested.

21:21.403 --> 21:23.572
You're asking me to believe
that the I.A.D.C...

21:23.655 --> 21:26.992
would send a single American agent
into a situation like this?

21:27.075 --> 21:29.661
Believe what you want. I'm alone.

21:30.120 --> 21:33.707
I'm here to look for the last
American agent who was sent here.

21:46.845 --> 21:49.431
We have been neglecting
our uninvited guest.

21:49.514 --> 21:52.976
Mr. Pruett, isn't it?
You're here from Maryland, aren't you?

21:53.059 --> 21:54.436
Chevy Chase?

21:54.686 --> 21:57.355
I'm thinking of changing that name
to Pompeii.

22:00.817 --> 22:04.529
You are about to witness a volcano...

22:07.240 --> 22:09.200
in your own back yard.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.128
Maryland, my Maryland!

22:23.256 --> 22:25.216
You said no one would be hurt.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.093
Nobody has been hurt.

22:29.095 --> 22:31.139
But I cannot guarantee...

22:31.598 --> 22:33.057
the same outcome next time.

22:37.437 --> 22:40.356
Where did you strike now? Hankow?

22:40.982 --> 22:42.191
Peking?

22:42.483 --> 22:45.153
You think you can bring
the dragon down to its knees?

22:45.236 --> 22:47.739
I told you we have nothing to do with this.

22:47.822 --> 22:49.407
Hold on!

22:49.824 --> 22:52.243
You must have estimated
the compass setting...

22:52.326 --> 22:53.411
of the beam before we came.

22:53.494 --> 22:57.206
The original beam followed
a setting of 317 degrees.

22:57.290 --> 22:59.542
And the one we just observed?

23:02.378 --> 23:03.754
It is roughly...

23:07.383 --> 23:09.802
078 degrees.

23:10.469 --> 23:12.722
I have no idea what they hit.

23:13.389 --> 23:15.307
I do not think it was China.

23:28.279 --> 23:30.656
There are more heroes on their way up.

23:31.866 --> 23:33.826
You must afford them a proper welcome.

23:33.909 --> 23:37.580
Not ticker tape, perhaps,
but nonetheless, a proper welcome.

23:37.663 --> 23:39.790
Lock him up and get started.

24:26.962 --> 24:28.296
Thank you.

24:28.714 --> 24:30.674
We're not a cruel people.

24:31.383 --> 24:33.343
We're an embattled people.

24:33.885 --> 24:36.304
You've been conquered many times.

24:36.513 --> 24:39.808
But you've always managed
to conquer your conquerors.

24:39.891 --> 24:42.269
We won't wait to be invaded this time.

24:43.353 --> 24:46.231
It is about an hour's climb to the summit.

24:46.982 --> 24:48.942
I don't know if you're telling the truth.

24:49.025 --> 24:51.820
But I believe that you're doing your duty
much as we are.

24:51.903 --> 24:53.405
Thank you, Mei Ling.

24:59.202 --> 25:01.496
We have to leave you over here.

25:09.170 --> 25:11.548
Depending on what happens
in the next few hours...

25:11.631 --> 25:13.633
we may or may not come back this way.

25:13.717 --> 25:17.095
I'm sorry it has to be like this.
I understand, Mei Ling.

25:19.597 --> 25:21.349
Try to stay in the shade.

25:21.891 --> 25:24.102
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

26:19.532 --> 26:23.035
- You're slowing up, Mikhail.
- On the contrary, you're holding me back.

26:23.119 --> 26:25.037
Who do you suppose Col. Minh sent?

26:25.121 --> 26:27.415
Their best.
Lin Wan, I would imagine.

26:28.207 --> 26:29.458
And Mei Ling.

26:29.542 --> 26:31.627
Something to look forward to.

27:08.956 --> 27:10.040
Comrade!

27:10.332 --> 27:11.750
Hold it, Lin Wan.

27:12.459 --> 27:14.169
The girl is between us.

27:14.837 --> 27:16.505
Be sensible, Comrade.

27:29.226 --> 27:32.354
You are even more beautiful
than I remembered you.

27:36.733 --> 27:40.278
I have imagined we would eventually
encounter the American phenomenon:

27:40.362 --> 27:41.488
Wonder Woman.

27:41.571 --> 27:42.906
It does seem inevitable.

27:42.989 --> 27:44.866
You have a saying in your country:

27:44.950 --> 27:47.577
"All good things must come to an end. "

27:47.702 --> 27:48.870
Regretfully.

27:52.040 --> 27:55.085
If you will listen to me,
I have a few simple suggestions.

27:55.168 --> 27:56.878
Hold this, my comrade.

28:05.512 --> 28:09.474
I have seen him do better
in the grip of a Siberian brown bear.

28:09.975 --> 28:11.393
It's impossible.

28:11.476 --> 28:13.436
I find it totally believable.

28:19.734 --> 28:21.903
Yes, you Americans have won.

28:22.737 --> 28:24.823
Not only do you have your own strength...

28:24.906 --> 28:27.408
but you have the strength
of that terrible weapon...

28:27.492 --> 28:29.077
whatever it is, on the mountaintop.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.913
No. That's what I was trying to tell you.

28:31.996 --> 28:34.791
The United States has nothing
to do with this weapon.

28:34.874 --> 28:38.086
But it is China and, apparently,
the Russians who have been hit.

28:38.169 --> 28:41.089
- Not the United States.
- We can't be sure of that.

28:41.214 --> 28:43.007
First China. Then Russia.

28:43.257 --> 28:45.635
Who's to say where this last beam struck?

28:45.718 --> 28:48.763
If there is a pattern,
then it was probably the United States.

28:48.846 --> 28:50.515
If we can just work together...

28:50.598 --> 28:53.309
maybe we can destroy this weapon
before it destroys us.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.521
You will not destroy anyone.

29:00.775 --> 29:02.193
Drop your weapons.

29:09.408 --> 29:11.786
If you resist, you will be destroyed...

29:12.620 --> 29:14.997
with the exception of Wonder Woman.

29:15.081 --> 29:17.833
We all know that you are indestructible.

29:18.251 --> 29:20.836
But We are not here to destroy any of you.

29:21.545 --> 29:23.965
In fact, the man We serve Welcomes you.

29:24.173 --> 29:26.801
I'd advise you to surrender, Tobirov.

29:27.134 --> 29:28.803
Drop your weapons.

29:30.971 --> 29:32.431
I'll be back.

29:33.641 --> 29:35.392
No! Wonder Woman, come back!

29:35.476 --> 29:38.104
The man we serve
wants and needs to talk to you.

29:38.187 --> 29:41.065
I'm afraid you people
have lost your best Weapon.

29:49.490 --> 29:51.575
We have one American agent.

29:52.326 --> 29:54.662
And I know where to locate the other.

29:54.745 --> 29:57.623
My men will see
that you have a pleasant journey.

30:23.357 --> 30:25.651
I see you're on the road again.

30:27.694 --> 30:30.072
How did you get involved in this?

30:30.989 --> 30:34.409
The man I work for happens to be...
I'm sorry.

30:35.452 --> 30:38.830
Happens to be
one of the world's foremost physicists.

30:39.456 --> 30:42.459
- A real genius.
- Yeah, genius for destruction.

30:43.335 --> 30:46.088
- It's a matter of opinion.
- His or yours?

30:47.047 --> 30:49.591
We will all benefit by what he does.

30:50.383 --> 30:52.385
How did Dave Pruett benefit?

30:52.469 --> 30:56.348
He is unharmed, sleeping peacefully.
Just a little tired.

30:56.431 --> 30:59.643
Yeah, sure. Who is this genius?

31:00.352 --> 31:02.354
He is anxious to see you.

31:02.479 --> 31:03.939
By the way...

31:04.189 --> 31:08.151
how did you get out of your rather
pressing problem down at the hotel?

31:08.568 --> 31:09.778
Wonder Woman.

31:09.861 --> 31:12.072
The lady does get around, doesn't she?
Come on.

31:12.155 --> 31:13.323
Sometimes.

31:18.328 --> 31:20.538
I can't stand this helpless feeling.

31:20.789 --> 31:22.999
No word from Diana
since she left the hotel?

31:23.083 --> 31:24.793
Nothing. Total silence.

31:24.918 --> 31:27.462
- Just like Pruett.
- Let's not get into that.

31:27.545 --> 31:30.089
I still haven't figured out
what to tell his family.

31:30.173 --> 31:33.843
- What about the Russians and Chinese?
- I've done some unofficial checking.

31:33.927 --> 31:36.095
They haven't heard
from their agents, either.

31:36.179 --> 31:38.681
Even if they had, they wouldn't admit it.

31:38.765 --> 31:40.225
But if it is true...

31:40.308 --> 31:43.019
then their embassies
will be contacting us, eventually.

31:43.102 --> 31:44.520
You can bank on it.

31:44.604 --> 31:47.273
They'll be strutting around,
pointing their fingers.

31:47.357 --> 31:50.485
We know you're behind this.
What have you done with our agents?

31:50.568 --> 31:52.737
Then we've really got something
to worry about.

31:52.820 --> 31:54.364
In the meantime?

31:54.822 --> 31:56.616
All we can do is wait.

31:56.699 --> 31:59.619
Hope that Diana
finds some way to contact us.

32:00.036 --> 32:02.789
Unless we hear from whoever's behind it.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.083
Even that would be a relief.

32:05.166 --> 32:07.210
At least we'd know
who we're dealing with.

32:12.882 --> 32:14.425
Arthur Chapman?

32:18.971 --> 32:20.181
You may leave us.

32:20.264 --> 32:22.558
Don't you have
some communication to arrange?

32:22.642 --> 32:23.976
Of course.

32:25.811 --> 32:27.313
Well, Diana...

32:29.023 --> 32:30.816
it's been a long time. Two years.

32:30.900 --> 32:32.902
I should have guessed it.

32:33.402 --> 32:35.613
You've come a long way in two years.

32:36.364 --> 32:37.448
NSA.

32:37.531 --> 32:39.992
Before that,
the Science and Resource Commission.

32:40.076 --> 32:43.662
And before that,
the old OSS with Joe Atkinson?

32:45.956 --> 32:49.168
Thirty-five years
in government laboratories.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.671
What happened to you?

32:52.755 --> 32:54.173
I changed my mind.

32:56.467 --> 32:57.718
I can see that.

32:58.135 --> 33:01.388
One morning, I came out of a meeting...

33:01.472 --> 33:03.349
and they were all there.

33:04.224 --> 33:08.520
The Joint Chiefs of Staff,
the State Department...

33:09.313 --> 33:12.024
somebody from the Bureau, the Company.

33:12.900 --> 33:16.153
I took one look at them and said:
"Either they're mad or I'm mad. "

33:16.236 --> 33:18.447
I'm not sure which one you decided.

33:19.364 --> 33:20.741
I told you.

33:21.408 --> 33:22.910
I changed my mind.

33:23.285 --> 33:27.372
The obedient inventor changed his mind.

33:27.873 --> 33:32.461
Millions have been made, no,
billions have been made off my copyright.

33:34.796 --> 33:36.256
And all my toys...

33:37.674 --> 33:39.843
have been used for war games.

33:40.093 --> 33:41.511
Is war a game?

33:42.304 --> 33:44.306
That is exactly my point.

33:46.600 --> 33:47.768
Now...

33:48.894 --> 33:50.687
there will be peace.

33:52.147 --> 33:54.149
And I shall dictate the terms.

33:54.232 --> 33:55.358
How?

33:55.734 --> 33:57.068
Follow me.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.366
Tell me...

34:03.450 --> 34:06.286
have you ever imagined
what it must feel like...

34:06.369 --> 34:11.123
to talk to the whole world, every
television and radio set on the earth?

34:12.042 --> 34:13.418
You're mad.

34:14.543 --> 34:17.922
I do not hold
the copyright on madness, either.

34:20.717 --> 34:22.469
We're ready for you, sir.

34:32.562 --> 34:34.022
You're on the air.

34:36.815 --> 34:41.321
Men, women, children of the world...

34:42.405 --> 34:44.364
I am talking to you.

34:45.366 --> 34:47.409
All ofyou, Wherever you are.

34:48.161 --> 34:52.498
I have interrupted
every radio and television program...

34:53.373 --> 34:57.211
because there is something
I must speak to you about.

34:58.588 --> 35:00.256
And you must listen.

35:00.673 --> 35:03.634
I Want to speak to you...

35:04.927 --> 35:06.387
about peace.

35:07.263 --> 35:10.016
NoW, every nation speaks about peace.

35:10.892 --> 35:13.936
But no one does enough to achieve it.

35:15.146 --> 35:16.522
Except me.

35:18.983 --> 35:22.612
Millions of Weapons
are still being manufactured...

35:22.695 --> 35:25.865
in the name of defense and deterrent.

35:26.616 --> 35:29.827
NoW, I tell you, this must stop.

35:30.453 --> 35:31.954
It Will stop.

35:33.372 --> 35:37.918
Or almost every one of you listening
Will knoW the meaning of Armageddon.

35:38.919 --> 35:42.214
The final battle betWeen good and evil.

35:42.631 --> 35:45.301
- It's Arthur Chapman.
- The physicist who dropped out?

35:45.384 --> 35:46.719
I had hoped...

35:46.802 --> 35:48.888
He once said
nobody would ever listen to him.

35:48.971 --> 35:50.765
...to spare my oWn country.

35:50.848 --> 35:55.186
But We have alWays joined
the other tWo great poWers...

35:55.436 --> 35:57.688
in the three-Way arms race...

35:57.813 --> 35:59.523
Prof. Chapman is mad.

36:00.149 --> 36:01.358
Mad? Maybe.

36:01.442 --> 36:04.737
Maybe he's just a civil servant
who now has absolute power.

36:04.820 --> 36:06.405
...choosing an area...

36:06.697 --> 36:10.576
Where the chance for loss oflife
is nonexistent.

36:11.577 --> 36:15.080
Vectors 24/35.

36:29.887 --> 36:33.015
We will now make the Black Hills...

36:34.016 --> 36:35.350
a bit blacker.

36:47.988 --> 36:52.909
Using the most powerful
laser beam on earth...

36:54.828 --> 36:57.372
powered by nuclear energy...

36:58.623 --> 37:00.375
I will turn...

37:01.376 --> 37:03.545
the entire planet...

37:04.171 --> 37:05.589
into a volcano.

37:16.433 --> 37:18.852
He actually thinks
the great powers of the world...

37:18.935 --> 37:20.854
will give in to his three-hour ultimatum?

37:20.937 --> 37:23.523
- He's quite convinced of it.
- And what if they refuse?

37:23.607 --> 37:25.942
He'll use the laser beam
to carry out his threat.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.527
What, Volcano Earth?

37:27.694 --> 37:30.405
There's no stopping him.
You can't fight it. No one can.

37:30.488 --> 37:32.407
You don't sound so convinced.

37:32.574 --> 37:34.075
It's too late.

37:35.076 --> 37:36.911
- Too late.
- No.

37:38.413 --> 37:40.957
- Not yet, it isn't.
- Wait!

37:44.544 --> 37:45.753
Guards!

37:47.797 --> 37:50.300
Get after her! I'll be right behind you.

38:15.116 --> 38:18.786
Amazing. The areas he picked
report not a single casualty.

38:19.662 --> 38:21.998
I've got a roomful
of Pentagon brass down there...

38:22.081 --> 38:25.751
trying to decide whether to attack
with conventional or nuclear weapons.

38:25.835 --> 38:28.421
The other countries are faced
with the same decision.

38:28.504 --> 38:32.133
Steve, don't they know
that there are five hostages there?

38:32.300 --> 38:35.761
The President just completed a meeting
with the top officials of NASA.

38:35.845 --> 38:38.723
Calls have been made
to the Chairman of the Soviet Union...

38:38.806 --> 38:41.350
the Premier of
the People's Republic of China.

38:41.434 --> 38:45.271
The Strategic Air Command's been
alerted. The planes are already in the air.

38:45.354 --> 38:47.690
What about Diana and the others?

38:48.149 --> 38:51.569
I guess that's why there's room at the top.
Nobody wants to be here.

39:00.035 --> 39:02.037
Well?
No luck so far.

39:02.371 --> 39:04.498
There's nothing she can do in the time left.

39:04.582 --> 39:06.458
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

39:06.542 --> 39:10.379
You still think the old I.A.D.C.
will come through?

39:10.462 --> 39:14.258
- You don't want to hear what I think.
- But of course I would.

39:14.842 --> 39:18.679
As soon as I get a clear signal that there
will be worldwide disarmament...

39:18.762 --> 39:20.848
everyone will have his say.

39:22.391 --> 39:25.102
I won't listen,
but everyone will have his say.

39:27.187 --> 39:28.981
Hold it! All of you!

39:31.859 --> 39:33.110
Wonder Woman!

39:36.405 --> 39:38.615
I am so glad you've come.

39:38.699 --> 39:41.451
As a matter of fact,
I was hoping to have you here.

39:41.535 --> 39:44.538
So that I could witness
a third world disaster?

39:44.997 --> 39:46.873
And stand by for the next?

39:47.082 --> 39:51.128
But, no, Wonder Woman.
I am doing this in the name of peace.

39:51.211 --> 39:53.547
The idea of peace is beautiful.

39:53.839 --> 39:56.133
But this is no way
to accomplish it.

39:56.508 --> 39:59.177
Why don't you ask the people...

39:59.386 --> 40:02.514
whose lives depend on
what their leaders decide?

40:04.224 --> 40:06.393
As a matter of fact...

40:07.310 --> 40:09.646
I really don't have to ask anyone.

40:09.729 --> 40:12.983
Corbin, tell her how we've suffered.
Just tell her.

40:13.483 --> 40:15.110
I can't, Arthur.

40:15.735 --> 40:18.947
I agree with her.
It won't work. Not your way.

40:19.114 --> 40:22.576
We have to work for peace,
but not by intimidation.

40:22.993 --> 40:25.704
Fools have said that
since the beginning of time.

40:25.787 --> 40:27.872
Everybody is a fool to you.

40:28.581 --> 40:33.044
There will be fools
who will send bombers to be strong.

40:33.628 --> 40:36.381
And there Will be fools
Who Will give in to you.

40:36.464 --> 40:40.009
And they will be seen as weaklings,
or even traitors.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.053
But, Arthur...

40:42.637 --> 40:46.141
the only real fool is you.

40:49.519 --> 40:51.020
And the Russians...

40:52.438 --> 40:54.065
what about them?

40:54.190 --> 40:56.943
Our answers will be planes
and submarines...

40:57.277 --> 40:58.987
missiles and tanks.

40:59.445 --> 41:01.614
Whatever it takes to destroy you.

41:02.115 --> 41:04.117
We have alWays fought that Way.

41:07.370 --> 41:11.165
And the People's Republic of China?

41:11.374 --> 41:13.501
There are 800 million of us.

41:14.210 --> 41:16.212
If there are 10 percent left...

41:16.295 --> 41:19.257
we will still, eventually,
dominate the world.

41:20.007 --> 41:21.884
It is called "the long view. "

41:21.968 --> 41:23.052
Chapman...

41:24.303 --> 41:25.972
you have created...

41:26.055 --> 41:29.892
the deadliest, the most dangerous
weapon the world has ever known...

41:29.976 --> 41:31.561
in the name of peace.

41:31.978 --> 41:36.899
But you believe in peace, Wonder Woman.
You always have.

41:36.983 --> 41:38.067
Yes.

41:38.734 --> 41:40.528
But it Won't Work your Way.

41:40.611 --> 41:43.614
I'm sure the world's leaders
would listen to you...

41:43.906 --> 41:45.908
once there was no more threat.

42:02.675 --> 42:04.218
Believe me, you...

42:07.847 --> 42:10.474
"Telephonic communication has begun...

42:11.517 --> 42:15.896
"between the heads of state
in Washington, Moscow and Peking. "

42:16.522 --> 42:19.400
- That is oblivion!
- They're consulting. It doesn't mean-

42:19.483 --> 42:22.861
"Headquarters, Strategic Air Command
in Omaha, Nebraska...

42:22.945 --> 42:25.155
"has been placed on the red alert. "

42:25.406 --> 42:28.826
- I warned you that that could happen.
- You warned me?

42:28.909 --> 42:31.036
I tell you, they're throwing you all away.

42:31.120 --> 42:32.496
Arthur, you can still do it.

42:32.579 --> 42:36.375
Make another transmission. Tell them
that you're deactivating the computer.

42:36.458 --> 42:38.544
And then they'll know they're right.

42:38.627 --> 42:42.297
Every government will be convinced
that it was tough and it was strong.

42:42.381 --> 42:44.007
Those are your words, Jack.

42:44.091 --> 42:46.218
And anybody who yielded to me...

42:46.301 --> 42:48.428
will be branded as a weakling, as a traitor.

42:48.512 --> 42:50.180
- No! I tell you, I was right!
- No!

42:50.264 --> 42:51.431
What have you done?

42:51.515 --> 42:53.725
I have done what I had to do. I'm sorry.

42:53.809 --> 42:55.811
Can the computer be reset?

42:56.561 --> 42:57.729
No.

42:58.021 --> 43:01.817
It goes in 10 minutes.
The world goes in 10 minutes.

43:03.402 --> 43:05.696
The nuclear power plant, where is it?

43:05.821 --> 43:09.241
It's in the middle of the mountain,
surrounded by concrete.

43:09.324 --> 43:10.826
There's no Way to get to it.

43:10.909 --> 43:12.327
How long will this beam last?

43:12.411 --> 43:13.912
Fifty seconds.

43:14.287 --> 43:16.248
After that, can it be fired again?

43:16.331 --> 43:17.457
No.

43:17.999 --> 43:20.085
Not without a complete recharge.

43:30.095 --> 43:32.931
What about them?
Shouldn't we let them go?

43:35.016 --> 43:36.434
Go where, Jack?

43:56.371 --> 43:59.290
She's put herself
between the beam and the outside world!

44:04.546 --> 44:07.006
Twenty, twenty-five...

44:07.548 --> 44:08.758
Twenty-five seconds.

44:43.584 --> 44:48.130
Before I have a Mandarin dinner served,
which I prepared myself...

44:49.382 --> 44:51.676
what do you wish me to do with these?

44:52.218 --> 44:56.847
Sir, may I show you something
that may answer two problems at once?

45:11.821 --> 45:13.614
May I speak for both of us?

45:14.114 --> 45:16.742
You may always do so, if you wish.

45:17.451 --> 45:20.329
Col. Minh,
we have served you loyally and well.

45:20.871 --> 45:22.039
You have.

45:23.666 --> 45:27.294
We would be most grateful
if you would accept our resignations.

45:27.378 --> 45:31.173
I do not think such a decision
should be made here and now.

45:31.715 --> 45:32.841
Why not, Colonel?

45:32.925 --> 45:35.386
They could have been lost.
Officially, that is.

45:35.469 --> 45:36.553
Irregular.

45:36.845 --> 45:39.306
On this mission no one was hurt, Colonel.

45:39.390 --> 45:42.059
But in the future, someone may be hurt.

45:42.142 --> 45:45.854
I do not wish anything to happen
that may interfere with our happiness.

45:45.938 --> 45:49.233
There may be even
some little Lin Wans and Mei Lings.

45:49.566 --> 45:52.736
That is the future
that you're talking about, isn't it?

45:55.614 --> 45:58.116
Apparently, it is out of my hands.

45:59.117 --> 46:01.662
There is some truth to the belief...

46:02.079 --> 46:05.082
that it is easy to lose oneself
in Chinatown.

46:05.666 --> 46:07.876
May I suggest that you do so?

46:08.251 --> 46:10.253
After dinner.
Of course.

46:13.256 --> 46:14.591
Thank you.

46:25.894 --> 46:27.771
It's a shame that Prof. Chapman...

46:27.854 --> 46:30.774
couldn't have handled
his problems with the same reason.

46:30.857 --> 46:32.526
He'll have to be put away.

46:32.609 --> 46:36.279
Mr. Corbin, I think that the I.A.D.C.
is gonna try and intervene.

46:36.780 --> 46:38.949
And we have Wonder Woman
to thank.

46:39.032 --> 46:41.660
She has helped you in the past, I'm told.

46:41.826 --> 46:43.870
I wish I might meet her one day.

46:44.871 --> 46:48.291
- When you do, will you cook for her, too?
- An honor.

46:49.209 --> 46:52.504
I think she might like Chinese food
as much as I do.
