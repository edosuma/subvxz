07:54.944 --> 07:57.045

I caused the death of an innocent.

08:01.746 --> 08:04.946
There are no innocents.

08:05.046 --> 08:08.613
This is war. And this...

08:08.713 --> 08:12.681
Well, this is simply a battlefield.

08:12.781 --> 08:15.148
We made it so!

08:15.247 --> 08:19.015
And every time we do, this world suffers.

08:19.115 --> 08:21.982
But I will have no more of it.

08:22.082 --> 08:23.982
From this moment on,

08:24.082 --> 08:27.283
I am no longer part of the Beast Wars.

08:29.150 --> 08:31.717
( growls )

08:31.818 --> 08:35.784
You would desert in the face of an enemy?

08:35.884 --> 08:39.019
You wouldn't. You-- You can't.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.519
( tense theme playing )

08:41.618 --> 08:44.386
My decision is made, little cat.

08:44.486 --> 08:46.353
Farewell.

08:51.787 --> 08:54.987
CHEETOR: Tigatron!

08:55.088 --> 08:58.521
INFERNO: So the tiger no longer wishes to fight.

Inferno to Terrorsaur and Waspinator.

09:03.889 --> 09:06.256
Regroup on my coordinates.

09:11.124 --> 09:14.024
I don't believe this. Now what are we gonna do?

09:16.091 --> 09:20.125
Predacons know how to deal with those who won't fight.

09:21.425 --> 09:22.659
( growls )

09:22.759 --> 09:24.093
Or...

09:25.526 --> 09:30.127
go back to base. You need repair.

09:30.227 --> 09:32.461
( growls ) Hey, wait, Dinobot!

09:32.561 --> 09:34.928
( dramatic theme playing )

Thank the Matrix.

09:43.830 --> 09:46.329
( ominous theme playing )

09:48.163 --> 09:50.931
We must return to base.

09:52.664 --> 09:54.864
we capture the Maximals invading our colony.

09:54.964 --> 09:57.631
Will you explain our failure to him?

09:57.731 --> 10:01.499
Oh. Uh, Megatron not like failure.

10:01.599 --> 10:04.399
Yes. Royalty--

10:04.499 --> 10:08.600
Uh, I mean Megatron. --has been a bit testy lately.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.934
We'll do it! ( giggles )

But we close the trap on my signal.

( Inferno laughing )

10:33.671 --> 10:35.104
( grunts )

10:35.205 --> 10:37.305
Head back to base and contact Rhinox

10:37.405 --> 10:38.839
as soon as you're in range.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.638
I want backup as soon as I can get it.

10:40.738 --> 10:42.439
What do you think's gonna happen?

10:42.539 --> 10:44.673
( dramatic theme playing )

10:44.773 --> 10:46.539
I don't know.

( gasps )

11:31.581 --> 11:33.447
( both growling )

11:33.547 --> 11:37.014
You have the instincts of a warrior.

11:37.114 --> 11:40.748
You know when danger's approaching.

11:40.849 --> 11:42.282
( growling )

11:42.382 --> 11:44.950
Why do you stalk me?

11:45.049 --> 11:48.983
To...talk.

11:50.350 --> 11:54.284
I have nothing more to say.

11:56.451 --> 11:58.651
Then look!

11:58.751 --> 12:01.052
( tense theme playing )

12:07.453 --> 12:09.854
( growling )

12:10.753 --> 12:12.687
( screeching )

12:12.787 --> 12:15.387
That is the law of the jungle.

12:15.488 --> 12:17.055
The hunters and the hunted.

12:17.155 --> 12:19.455
Scrap or be scrapped.

12:19.555 --> 12:22.288
Animals hunt to survive.

12:22.388 --> 12:25.756
And what do you think war is about?

12:25.856 --> 12:29.157
Maximals may believe in peace,

12:29.257 --> 12:31.557
but Predacons...

12:31.657 --> 12:35.091
You do not really know the Predacons.

12:35.191 --> 12:37.991
We-- They...

12:38.091 --> 12:41.391
live for the glory of conquest.

12:41.492 --> 12:43.726
( dramatic theme playing )

12:43.825 --> 12:48.160
If Megatron takes the energon wealth of this world unopposed,

12:48.260 --> 12:50.427
he will begin a war.

12:50.527 --> 12:54.594
A war that will destroy Cybertron and shatter galaxies,

12:54.694 --> 12:58.695
until only one side survives.

12:58.795 --> 13:02.662
( Megatron laughing )

13:02.762 --> 13:07.163
DINOBOT: It has been this way for hundreds of stellar cycles.

13:07.263 --> 13:09.430
Ever since Autobot and Decepticon

13:09.530 --> 13:12.563
first began the great war.

13:12.663 --> 13:18.499
Hm. Peace will never come until someone agrees not to fight.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.866
The Predacons will not allow it.

13:21.966 --> 13:25.633
They will destroy you or reprogram you.

13:25.732 --> 13:28.600
They will not find me.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.501
No...

13:30.600 --> 13:32.701
I found you.

13:32.801 --> 13:34.901
( both growling )

13:37.435 --> 13:40.468
I do not wish to fight you.

13:40.568 --> 13:44.402
You have no choice, coward!

13:44.503 --> 13:48.070
If you're not with us, then you're against us.

13:48.170 --> 13:49.836
( both growling )

13:51.670 --> 13:53.071
Stay away!

13:53.171 --> 13:55.238
Make me!

13:55.338 --> 13:57.271
( roars )

13:59.505 --> 14:01.472
I will not do this!

14:01.572 --> 14:03.239
Fine!

14:03.339 --> 14:06.306
Then die!

14:06.406 --> 14:08.640
( growling )

14:12.107 --> 14:14.207
( dramatic theme playing )

14:16.075 --> 14:17.541
( growling )

14:19.475 --> 14:21.175
( growling )

14:23.076 --> 14:26.309
A Predacon wouldn't miss.

14:27.710 --> 14:30.010
Now return to your duty.

14:30.110 --> 14:31.077
No!

14:31.177 --> 14:33.978
( growls )

14:34.077 --> 14:36.278
Well, so be it.

14:36.378 --> 14:38.411
( roars )

14:40.245 --> 14:42.146
Stand down, Dinobot, now!

14:42.246 --> 14:46.112
No! This must not be allowed!

14:46.212 --> 14:47.479
That's an order!

14:47.579 --> 14:49.447
( sighs )

14:52.014 --> 14:56.148
Don't you at least want to say something to him?

14:57.314 --> 14:59.615
Yes.

14:59.715 --> 15:01.882
I'm sorry about your friend.

15:01.982 --> 15:04.282
I know how much she meant to you.

15:04.382 --> 15:06.549
( growls )

15:06.649 --> 15:08.550
Aah! Sentiment!

15:08.650 --> 15:11.984
The more time I spend with you Maximals,

15:12.084 --> 15:14.718
the more I wonder how you survived so long.

15:14.818 --> 15:18.252
I'm returning to my duties.

15:27.786 --> 15:31.053
Tigatron, I hate this war as much as any of us.

15:31.153 --> 15:34.021
All the more reason to stop it.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.420
We don't belong here, Optimus.

15:36.521 --> 15:39.188
But we are here. And as Maximals,

15:39.288 --> 15:43.456
we've got a duty to explore and defend this world.

15:43.556 --> 15:45.890
( ominous theme playing )

15:45.990 --> 15:49.723
Ooh! That's not tiger-bot!

15:49.823 --> 15:54.590
Who cares? Dinobot will make an even better prize.

15:54.690 --> 15:57.825
Fan out. We'll ambush him as he leaves the forest.

15:57.925 --> 15:59.992
( screeches )

16:00.092 --> 16:02.425
( both laughing )

16:05.026 --> 16:07.460
( suspenseful theme playing )

16:10.527 --> 16:13.361
Hmm, I must have been mad to--

16:13.461 --> 16:14.561
( gasps )

Maximize!

16:39.231 --> 16:41.331
( grunts )

16:43.399 --> 16:46.299
Dinobot. He might need some help.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.301
I guess you've made your decision.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.401
Prime jets, on!

16:59.501 --> 17:02.002

17:33.407 --> 17:38.008
Ooh! Megatron reward Waspinator for my victory!

17:38.108 --> 17:41.009
Your victory? It's my--

17:41.109 --> 17:43.209
It's Optimus!

17:43.309 --> 17:46.509
Excellent. He'll have no chance against the three of us.

17:46.609 --> 17:48.143
( all laugh )

17:52.610 --> 17:56.211
COMPUTER: Warning. Power cells at 35 percent and dropping.

17:56.311 --> 17:58.444
Transform to beast mode.

18:01.412 --> 18:05.412
TERRORSAUR ( in singsong ): Optimus is ours! Optimus is ours!

18:05.512 --> 18:08.946
Waspinator will finish him!

18:15.914 --> 18:17.981
( Terrorsaur screeches )

18:19.814 --> 18:21.549
For the royalty!

18:21.649 --> 18:23.148
( Optimus yells )

18:23.248 --> 18:25.116
( grunting )

18:25.216 --> 18:27.049
Optimus!

18:27.149 --> 18:29.116
( groaning )

18:34.450 --> 18:36.218
( both grunt )

18:43.985 --> 18:45.919
( Inferno laughing )

18:48.187 --> 18:50.620

18:53.887 --> 18:57.087
Attack!

18:57.188 --> 18:59.621
Ha-ha! Unh!

19:01.454 --> 19:03.322
Tigatron.

19:03.422 --> 19:05.155
( groaning )

19:06.190 --> 19:07.722
( laughing )

19:07.822 --> 19:11.156
( dramatic theme playing )

19:14.524 --> 19:16.291
Back off, Predacon.

19:16.391 --> 19:19.491
You'll kill no more beasts today.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.692

( laughing )

19:28.626 --> 19:31.793
( tense theme playing )

19:31.893 --> 19:36.227
You will leave the wild alone!

19:47.563 --> 19:52.196
Once again, this planet pays the price for our war.

19:52.297 --> 19:54.931
( somber theme playing )

20:02.831 --> 20:05.165
Well done, Maximal.

20:06.933 --> 20:09.733
You chose a perfect moment

20:09.832 --> 20:12.400
to rejoin our ranks.

20:12.500 --> 20:16.301
I am in your debt.

20:17.734 --> 20:20.535
I must still grieve for my friend.

20:24.036 --> 20:28.136
But as long as there are Predacons to harm this world,

20:28.236 --> 20:31.403
we Maximals must protect it.
