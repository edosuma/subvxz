16:02.968 --> 16:05.507
[indistinct chatter]

16:05.574 --> 16:08.547
[laughter]

16:08.613 --> 16:10.684
Sweet.

16:10.751 --> 16:13.055
Turn this shit up.

16:13.122 --> 16:15.594
-[music blasting]
-Drinks on me, baby!

16:28.052 --> 16:31.024
-Thanks, EZ.
-How's your mom doing?

16:31.091 --> 16:32.795
She settling in okay?

16:32.862 --> 16:35.399
It's been an adjustment.

16:36.168 --> 16:38.205
She's trying.

16:39.976 --> 16:42.347
This will help a lot.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.365
Is there an update from Creeper?

16:53.335 --> 16:56.174
He's got a bead on it.

16:56.241 --> 16:58.647
Says he's close, so...

16:58.713 --> 17:02.755
whoever this rat is,
we'll get him.

17:02.821 --> 17:05.026
Soon.

17:07.898 --> 17:11.305
[door opens]

17:13.142 --> 17:16.114
[door closes]

17:34.852 --> 17:37.290
[door opens]

17:42.467 --> 17:45.339
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

17:49.582 --> 17:52.020
[chains rattling]

17:52.788 --> 17:55.393
[man speaking indistinctly
over P. A.]

18:03.677 --> 18:05.681
[clears throat]

18:05.747 --> 18:08.920
Neron, we don't have
a lot of time.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.757
They took my badge.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.160
I got in today on a favor,

18:12.226 --> 18:15.801
but I don't want
to burn my friend.

18:18.172 --> 18:19.775
Have you heard of Kevin Jimenez?

18:19.842 --> 18:22.013
Is that the rat?

18:22.080 --> 18:23.817
DEA agent.

18:23.883 --> 18:27.524
His signature was on every one
of the CI's redacted case files.

18:27.591 --> 18:30.631
What's that got to do
with the club?

18:30.697 --> 18:32.735
He's dead.

18:34.437 --> 18:38.178
I think whoever
protected the CI,

18:38.245 --> 18:40.282
they wanted it buried.

18:41.218 --> 18:43.823
And whoever else knew
along with it.

18:46.061 --> 18:48.399
This is big, Neron.

18:49.535 --> 18:51.906
Really.

18:51.973 --> 18:53.610
Scary big.

18:55.781 --> 18:58.319
So who's the fucking CI?

18:58.385 --> 19:00.624
Who's the rat?

19:02.226 --> 19:03.963
Tell me.

19:04.030 --> 19:06.301
Please.

19:08.807 --> 19:10.176
EZ Reyes.

19:10.242 --> 19:12.915
[laughs]

19:12.981 --> 19:14.184
No, it's not.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.288
It's fucking not.

19:16.355 --> 19:20.597
Go back. Find out who it is.

19:20.664 --> 19:23.503
I searched through
fucking everything.

19:23.570 --> 19:26.843
All of the CI's
redacted documents,

19:26.909 --> 19:29.314
all of the court documents.

19:29.381 --> 19:32.253
I went to Kevin Jimenez's
fucking widow.

19:32.320 --> 19:35.894
And it turns out
that Jimenez and EZ

19:35.961 --> 19:38.265
are cousins.

19:38.332 --> 19:41.839
It's all on tape.
I heard it myself.

19:41.906 --> 19:44.712
Why the fuck do you do it?

19:44.779 --> 19:46.381
What?

19:46.448 --> 19:48.686
What do you get out of...

19:48.753 --> 19:50.423
torturing me?

19:50.489 --> 19:52.594
I'm not trying to hurt you.

19:53.530 --> 19:55.801
I'm just telling you the truth.

19:56.569 --> 19:59.340
Like, think about it.

19:59.407 --> 20:02.146
No one's released early

20:02.213 --> 20:03.817
from a charge like that.

20:03.883 --> 20:07.490
He went to prison
for killing a cop.

20:09.562 --> 20:10.964
CO!

20:11.031 --> 20:12.801
Neron...

20:12.868 --> 20:14.370
CO!

20:15.406 --> 20:17.511
-[knocking]
-Ready to go.

20:17.578 --> 20:21.519
Neron, I'm sorry, I...

20:22.654 --> 20:24.257
I don't fucking understand,

20:24.324 --> 20:26.361
I did everything
you asked me to do.

20:27.263 --> 20:28.533
Ready to go?

20:30.336 --> 20:32.808
Neron, I lost my fucking job.

20:38.018 --> 20:41.726
Fuck, Neron, I did everything
you fucking asked me to do!

20:47.170 --> 20:50.744
Tell Smokey I need to see him.

21:03.469 --> 21:05.640
Could've swore there was
a beer in here somewhere.

21:14.157 --> 21:15.760
You don't like dogs?

21:15.827 --> 21:17.698
No, they're, uh...

21:18.533 --> 21:20.804
...unpredictable.

21:24.043 --> 21:26.616
So, what's up?

21:28.485 --> 21:30.790
How are things with you and EZ?

21:31.559 --> 21:34.130
I'd say that's mine
and EZ's business.

21:34.197 --> 21:36.769
[motorcycle approaching]

21:49.427 --> 21:54.538
Sorry, I'm not trying
to, uh, be nosy.

21:56.141 --> 21:59.113
No, I'm just curious.

21:59.180 --> 22:01.484
How is my brother doing?

22:01.552 --> 22:03.222
You should ask him.

22:03.288 --> 22:05.794
You see him every day.

22:08.098 --> 22:10.169
Hmm.

22:10.236 --> 22:12.173
[inhales deeply]

22:12.240 --> 22:14.512
[sighs]

22:16.414 --> 22:19.655
That thing with Lobo...

22:19.722 --> 22:21.258
[scoffs]

22:21.324 --> 22:23.128
Hey.

22:23.195 --> 22:25.867
That was fucking awful.

22:25.934 --> 22:28.907
You saw it. I... [sighs]

22:28.973 --> 22:34.017
I don't understand
why EZ doesn't see...

22:38.225 --> 22:40.597
You have to get him to stop.

22:41.799 --> 22:42.868
Please.

22:44.270 --> 22:48.045
Just... tell him
to stop all of it.

22:48.111 --> 22:51.151
The-the-the fucking fentanyl?

22:51.218 --> 22:52.921
[exhales]

22:54.825 --> 22:57.898
Yo, EZ's gonna get us all hurt.

22:58.833 --> 23:00.503
Even you.

23:01.438 --> 23:02.808
What does that mean?

23:02.874 --> 23:06.649
It means you need to
fucking get him to stop.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.694
You should go, Angel.

23:16.702 --> 23:19.808
I'm sorry, that...

23:19.875 --> 23:21.846
I'm sorry.

23:22.581 --> 23:24.050
I don't know what the fuck
I'm even doing here.

23:24.117 --> 23:27.156
[chuckles] You know,
I should've just fucking burnt

23:27.223 --> 23:29.662
all that fucking shit down.

23:30.830 --> 23:34.003
I should've just fucking burned
all this fucking shit down, too.

23:34.070 --> 23:36.609
-Oh, my fucking God.
-What does that mean?

23:36.676 --> 23:40.482
What does that mean? Angel!

23:44.090 --> 23:45.025
[knocking]

23:45.092 --> 23:47.531
Knock knock.

23:52.106 --> 23:55.012
I'd like to say
this is unexpected.

24:03.730 --> 24:07.738
Jesus, you have a shitty view.

24:07.804 --> 24:09.808
You don't envy my...

24:09.875 --> 24:13.048
mediocre watercolor of some...

24:13.115 --> 24:15.319
random marsh?

24:15.386 --> 24:17.824
Well, I have an actual window,

24:17.891 --> 24:21.431
so I get unobstructed views
of the Pacific over Coronado.

24:21.499 --> 24:23.268
Well, you're an asshole.

24:23.335 --> 24:24.972
[chuckles softly]

24:25.039 --> 24:27.844
Lincoln Potter came
to see you, I assume?

24:27.911 --> 24:31.084
Not, uh, not Potter himself.

24:31.151 --> 24:32.654
And what did these...

24:32.721 --> 24:36.862
Potter-adjacent individuals
have to say?

24:36.929 --> 24:39.702
Trust me,
you don't want to know.

24:39.768 --> 24:43.743
Uh, I think the fact
that I'm asking

24:43.810 --> 24:49.120
is evidence that
I indeed do want to know.

24:49.187 --> 24:50.690
Officially, they want
to make sure

24:50.757 --> 24:52.226
that our allocated funds
aren't being spent--

24:52.293 --> 24:54.598
Unofficially.

24:56.602 --> 24:59.541
They told me...

24:59.608 --> 25:03.115
"put that bitch on a leash."

25:03.181 --> 25:06.321
[laughing]

25:06.388 --> 25:09.327
And this came from...?

25:09.394 --> 25:11.665
As high up as can be expected.

25:11.732 --> 25:13.035
-Ah.
-Look, I know

25:13.101 --> 25:15.172
this makes you want
to sink your teeth--

25:15.239 --> 25:18.613
Oh, hell yes, it does.

25:18.679 --> 25:21.552
This means something is here.

25:21.619 --> 25:25.225
I see that motherfucker,
and he knows it.

25:25.292 --> 25:26.495
He's scared, and--

25:26.562 --> 25:28.733
I just don't want a mess.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.537
Let's be clear, Dan.

25:30.603 --> 25:34.277
Are you asking me
not to do my job?

25:34.343 --> 25:36.982
I wouldn't waste that breath.

25:39.087 --> 25:43.830
But you're poking around a very
powerful, very effective...

25:43.896 --> 25:46.736
and thus very protected
individual.

25:48.573 --> 25:53.148
I'm not asking you
to not do your job,

25:53.215 --> 25:56.722
just to be careful
that we keep ours.

25:58.793 --> 26:01.197
I'm making my first move today.

26:02.166 --> 26:05.874
Maybe it was a misunderstanding,
but...

26:05.940 --> 26:08.679
when we discussed embarking upon

26:08.746 --> 26:12.453
a peace treaty with Eduardo,

26:12.521 --> 26:15.727
it did not mean

26:15.794 --> 26:20.102
dragging a carving knife
over his jugular

26:20.169 --> 26:23.275
in front of his
kindergarten-aged daughter.

26:27.316 --> 26:29.655
Let me explain.

26:30.824 --> 26:35.867
Keeping order from devolving
into chaos is complex.

26:35.934 --> 26:39.541
It's a... It's the Black Swan
pas de deux,

26:39.608 --> 26:41.277
not a drunken mosh pit.

26:41.344 --> 26:44.450
We had your meeting. We sat
across from that disgusting man.

26:44.518 --> 26:47.189
And while our palms were still
clammy from shaking his hand,

26:47.256 --> 26:49.628
he'd already killed one
of my soldiers

26:49.695 --> 26:53.034
and raided one
of our establishments.

26:53.101 --> 26:58.044
Clearly as a fuck you to me,
to Miguel and you.

27:00.617 --> 27:02.521
Oh...

27:02.587 --> 27:04.758
you haven't told her.

27:05.693 --> 27:07.731
Awkward.

27:07.798 --> 27:09.400
Well, uh... [clears throat]

27:09.467 --> 27:12.373
In an ironic twist, Goliath,

27:12.439 --> 27:14.310
um, excuse me...

27:14.377 --> 27:18.686
it was David's stone and sling

27:18.753 --> 27:20.757
that hit your cookhouse.

27:20.824 --> 27:23.763
What is this motherfucker
talking about?

27:23.830 --> 27:26.034
[Lincoln]
The Mayans.

27:26.100 --> 27:29.608
Look, we don't know for sure.
I was just following up.

27:29.675 --> 27:31.177
Come on.

27:32.012 --> 27:34.450
What else were you
doing with them today?

27:34.518 --> 27:36.321
Cartel tai chi?

27:37.456 --> 27:39.260
I was making inquiries.

27:39.327 --> 27:42.333
To see if it was possible
they knew something.

27:56.427 --> 27:58.833
You followed me?

28:01.337 --> 28:03.041
I own you, Miguel.

28:03.108 --> 28:06.414
I own you,
your mannequin family,

28:06.481 --> 28:08.051
your little glass house.

28:08.118 --> 28:11.525
I took it all away from you once
with a phone call, remember?

28:11.592 --> 28:16.301
And then I built it all
back up again with another one.

28:16.367 --> 28:18.673
Everything you have,
everything...

28:18.739 --> 28:21.277
begins and ends with me,
motherfucker.

28:21.344 --> 28:23.315
Do not forget that.

28:24.785 --> 28:28.391
People who forget that suffer.

28:28.458 --> 28:31.164
Entire families suffer.

28:40.750 --> 28:44.223
Do you know why his penis
was so tiny?

28:46.461 --> 28:49.467
Michelangelo's David.

28:51.304 --> 28:57.149
A tiny penis was seen as a sign
of intellectual superiority.

28:57.216 --> 29:01.357
They believed only, uh,
savages were well-hung.

29:01.424 --> 29:04.598
What the fuck does that have
to do with anything?

29:04.665 --> 29:06.936
It's just sad.

29:07.837 --> 29:12.246
To think back then I would have
been dismissed as a barbarian.

29:14.651 --> 29:17.991
Ah. There's some progress.

29:29.113 --> 29:31.752
-[grunts]
-[children cheering]

29:34.691 --> 29:36.695
-Hi.
-Hi.

29:36.762 --> 29:39.233
Oh, mama...

29:39.300 --> 29:41.337
No, stop.

29:41.404 --> 29:43.208
-Look, I'm so big.
-Oh, stop.

29:43.274 --> 29:45.145
Girl, if I looked half as good
as you when I was pregnant,

29:45.212 --> 29:47.216
I would have been modeling
Victoria's Secrets.

29:47.282 --> 29:48.451
Oh, please.

29:48.519 --> 29:49.655
You're perfect. Stop it.

29:49.721 --> 29:52.627
-You look great.
-Thank you.

29:52.694 --> 29:54.865
So good to see you.

29:54.931 --> 29:58.673
Um, so... You know what?
Excuse me.

29:58.739 --> 29:59.941
-I-I'll be right back.
-You okay?

30:00.008 --> 30:01.745
-Yeah, yeah, okay.
-Okay.

30:01.812 --> 30:03.916
Oh, great, thank you for coming.

30:03.983 --> 30:05.620
Thank you so much for coming.

30:05.687 --> 30:06.855
Hey.

30:06.922 --> 30:08.693
Someone's gonna call the cops

30:08.759 --> 30:10.697
if you keep having so much fun.

30:10.763 --> 30:13.468
I'm having fun.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.646
Honey, come on.

30:18.713 --> 30:21.618
You're sitting here by yourself.

30:21.685 --> 30:23.823
Exactly.

30:29.100 --> 30:32.172
Did you know about this?

30:33.308 --> 30:34.945
Marcus, come on.

30:35.012 --> 30:36.915
Please don't do this.

30:36.982 --> 30:40.857
Tessa. Santi. Let's go, huh?

30:40.923 --> 30:43.128
[Tessa]
Dad, no.

30:44.463 --> 30:46.835
I said let's go.

30:51.712 --> 30:54.417
Hey, primo, you leaving?

30:57.489 --> 30:59.494
Hey.

31:01.030 --> 31:04.470
I'm sorry, Obispo.
He's just not ready.

31:06.842 --> 31:08.579
Congratulations.

31:08.646 --> 31:10.248
Thank you.

31:12.554 --> 31:15.459
Come on, mija.

31:15.526 --> 31:17.029
Hurry up.

31:17.997 --> 31:20.570
I'm sorry, but let's go.

31:20.636 --> 31:22.372
Sorry.

31:40.777 --> 31:42.446
[Maggie]
Hey.

31:46.688 --> 31:47.957
You good?

36:27.249 --> 36:29.486
was calling the shots
up in Stockton.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.323

36:31.390 --> 36:34.296
Brought him into the car
to program.

Then, one night, this fool...

36:37.369 --> 36:40.876
he gets rolled up
and he disappears like a ghost.

36:40.943 --> 36:45.018

he's back on the street,

36:45.085 --> 36:47.489

we would talk.

how he reconnected
with that homeboy,

who was doing time
for killing a cop.

37:19.286 --> 37:20.689

for the Mayans.

on are sleepless nights.

I still have plenty of those.

44:41.871 --> 44:43.909
Do you regret having children?

44:43.975 --> 44:46.814
That's a very strange question
to ask a mother.

44:46.881 --> 44:50.454
I'm just curious.
Aside from adequate rest,

44:50.522 --> 44:53.427
I just, I'm wondering
what it is I'm missing.

44:54.730 --> 44:57.001
I guess maybe...

44:58.805 --> 45:01.043
...just a deep, primal love

45:01.109 --> 45:03.982
that is completely out
of your control.

45:05.218 --> 45:06.220
That... [sighs]

than enjoyable.

45:08.825 --> 45:11.764
Yeah. Yeah, it's terrifying.

45:13.635 --> 45:15.204
But it's freeing

45:15.271 --> 45:18.745
to love something
so much more than yourself.

45:20.515 --> 45:22.920
I think motherhood is
too often thought of

45:22.987 --> 45:25.424
as this soft thing.

you'll go to,

on this property?

46:35.699 --> 46:39.540
and... 26 cents.

That number and a few others
have brought me here.

If you have a warrant,
I'd love to see it.

a conversation

Your sins are out
of my jurisdiction.

47:02.385 --> 47:05.257
I don't know how much
you know about the...

47:05.324 --> 47:07.663
Inspector General's office,
but we only investigate--

47:07.730 --> 47:09.667
Your own.

47:09.734 --> 47:12.071
[chuckles] Well, not my own.

47:12.138 --> 47:17.048
I don't care what badge
or nameplate you have.

47:17.115 --> 47:20.488
If you're a bad actor,

47:20.555 --> 47:22.893
not one of mine.

47:27.035 --> 47:29.439
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Galindo,

47:29.507 --> 47:32.011
I know you're a bad man.

47:33.013 --> 47:35.418
And unlike the cynics...

47:36.420 --> 47:39.392
...I think bad men
will always fall.

47:40.127 --> 47:42.231
And you will fall.

47:42.298 --> 47:43.968
The best you have to hope for

47:44.035 --> 47:46.206
is several hundred years
in prison.

47:46.273 --> 47:48.545
But...

47:50.247 --> 47:52.485
I believe there's
someone much worse.

47:53.253 --> 47:56.426
And if you help us,
if you help...

47:56.494 --> 48:00.000
enlighten us into
the special relationship

48:00.067 --> 48:02.338
the two of you have...

48:03.173 --> 48:05.879
...then I am here to offer you

48:05.946 --> 48:09.653
the possibility
of getting out in time...

48:09.720 --> 48:11.891
for your son's wedding.

48:12.659 --> 48:15.097
Is that your sales pitch?

48:15.164 --> 48:16.734
I mean... [chuckles]

48:16.801 --> 48:18.938
To offer a free man a cage?

48:19.005 --> 48:20.776
You actually think you're free?

48:20.842 --> 48:22.713
It'll take just one little rock

48:22.780 --> 48:27.488
and your little glass house
will come crashing down.

48:28.257 --> 48:32.365
A trigger is being squeezed,
Mr. Galindo.

48:35.705 --> 48:37.509
I am here...

48:37.576 --> 48:41.984
to give you
a chance to choose...

48:45.224 --> 48:48.598
...which side of the barrel
you want to be on.

48:50.134 --> 48:52.773
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

48:52.840 --> 48:55.344
I abhor violence.

48:55.411 --> 48:59.753
Not only the cowards like
yourself who engage in it.

48:59.820 --> 49:01.490
But even more so

49:01.557 --> 49:03.895
those who enable it...

49:03.962 --> 49:06.534
and profit from it.

49:06.601 --> 49:09.239
I see you've been careful

49:09.305 --> 49:12.546
to not mention Lincoln Potter
by name.

49:13.347 --> 49:14.950
Well, it appears
you knew exactly

49:15.017 --> 49:17.756
who I was speaking about.

49:17.823 --> 49:19.960
No need.

49:28.912 --> 49:30.916
It's obvious...

49:30.982 --> 49:34.355

your family, sir.
