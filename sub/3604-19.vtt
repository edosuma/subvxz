MOHINDER:
Previously on Heroes.

00:04.380 --> 00:07.122
A fax came in
this morning addressed
to Hiro and Ando.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.296
HIRO: Someone named Rebel.

00:08.384 --> 00:10.875
Who?
Just an address
in Los Angeles

00:10.970 --> 00:14.133
and the words
"Save Matt Parkman."

00:14.849 --> 00:17.465
SYLAR: I’ve been
here before. / remember.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.512
Mommy?

00:19.645 --> 00:20.760
SYLAR: He killed my mother.

00:20.897 --> 00:24.355
LUKE: Where are you going?
To find my father.
I want him to die.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.399
Why are you
doing this, Nathan?

00:30.031 --> 00:31.146
Goodbye, Nathan.

00:31.449 --> 00:32.609
Pete!

00:35.786 --> 00:38.038
NATHAN: Tracy...
Don't come any closer.

00:38.873 --> 00:40.079
(MOANS)

00:41.876 --> 00:43.116
You'd better
get used to the heat

00:43.211 --> 00:45.076
because you are
never getting out
of here again.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.165
Looks like your
friend's back.
Rebel?

00:47.256 --> 00:48.587
I think there's
something he wants
us to see.

00:48.674 --> 00:49.834
That's us.
Thatsthe
entire operation.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.127
They got
the whole thing
on tape.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.925
PETER: It's done. I got it!
MATT: Go, go, go, go!

00:53.012 --> 00:54.627
Don't do this.
Go! l'll hold them!

00:57.767 --> 01:00.804
To me, you look
exactly like
a terrorist.

01:01.187 --> 01:02.302
No.

01:18.496 --> 01:19.827
You...

01:19.997 --> 01:21.328
Hey, Barbie.

01:23.626 --> 01:26.208
I got a message from
someone named Rebel.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.501
Said you could help me.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.122
I need your help, Barbie.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.006
Rebe| promised.

01:33.511 --> 01:37.345
Well, he lied.
Now get out!

01:37.431 --> 01:40.639
Please, I can't
go back out there.

01:42.311 --> 01:46.224
Claire? You okay?
Oh, my God.

01:46.315 --> 01:49.478
Mom, it's all right.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.693
Mr. Doyle, here,
was just leaving.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.943
No. Please,
they'll catch me.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.945
Rebel said you could
help me start over.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.948
That's all I want.
To go back to
being a puppeteer,

02:02.915 --> 02:04.655
making people happy.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.958
And you thought
I would help you?

02:08.963 --> 02:10.203
After what you did?

02:10.298 --> 02:14.086
You should know,
there are agents
parked outside this house.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.383
Actually, they're not.

02:16.470 --> 02:20.588
Rebel sent a fake call,
which they'll figure out
any minute now.

02:20.683 --> 02:23.390
But if there were
agents outside,

02:24.562 --> 02:26.143
why aren't they
kicking in
the door looking

02:26.230 --> 02:28.972
to collect a
comes-back-to-life
Barbie?

02:31.902 --> 02:35.394
They gave me
a free pass.

02:36.198 --> 02:39.031
But they will
come after me if
I try to help anyone.

02:39.452 --> 02:42.819
So you turn your back
on your own kind

02:42.913 --> 02:45.495
while we're
all out there
being hunted down?

02:46.834 --> 02:51.624
They burned down
my theater while
I was still inside.

you have no idea

03:00.973 --> 03:03.430
what it's like
to be hunted,

03:04.518 --> 03:06.019
to live on the street,

03:07.104 --> 03:08.935
to break into the home
of the last person

03:09.023 --> 03:11.139
on Earth you'd
expect to help you,

03:11.567 --> 03:13.933
because she was
your only hope.

03:15.404 --> 03:16.814

(BOTH EXHALE)

03:23.788 --> 03:25.073
Well,

03:27.416 --> 03:30.032
I'm not gonna force
you to help me, Claire.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.708
That's not who I am anymore.

have you been?

03:51.816 --> 03:54.057
Dealing with the mess
your brother left us.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.436
There wouldn't
have been a mess

03:55.569 --> 03:56.820
if you'd released
Parkman and Millbrook

03:56.904 --> 03:57.939
like I asked you to.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.107
I made
the right choice.

03:59.198 --> 04:02.611
Peterjust got lucky.
Though I have wondered,

04:02.701 --> 04:04.953
how many people knew
he was on that rooftop?

Petrelli. What?
Yeah, I'm on my way.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.331
I thought Parkman
was in your custody.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.542
He was,
last time I checked.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.422
Then what the hell's
he doing in front of

to his chest?

through to him.

any closer to me.

Everything's
gonna be all right.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.647
No, it's not!
You turned me
into a terrorist!

05:16.734 --> 05:18.395
I didn't sanction this.
That was Danko.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.976
You're lying to me!
He's got an agenda.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.059
You're lying to me.

I can't. I can't,

05:31.081 --> 05:32.617
You're gonna have to
trust me, Matt.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.495

is ready, sir.

a problem here.

get there so fast?

to play hero?

Matt, if we don't disarm you,
they're gonna shoot you.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.700
There are a lot of
bomb techs around here.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.828
I'm sure one of them
is thinking about
how to disarm that.

Get inside his head.

The drugs are
starting to wear off,
but I don't think I...

What's he thinking?

BOMB TECH: Red Wire.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.635
Red wire, red wire!

07:10.723 --> 07:12.054
Red wire.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.931
BOMB TECH: It doesn’t
make any sense.

07:15.019 --> 07:17.556
Why would a suicide bomber
bother with dummy wiring?

07:17.646 --> 07:18.681
Don't touch
the red wire!

07:18.856 --> 07:19.936
I'm not
touching anything!

take the shot.

Black wire is the key.

07:30.326 --> 07:31.281
Black wire, black wire!

07:31.368 --> 07:33.404
Black wire, black wire.

07:34.038 --> 07:36.529
Do I pull the black wire,
or is that the one
I don't pull?

07:36.624 --> 07:38.034
I don't know.
He's not thinking
directly about it.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.581
I gotta dig deeper.
Hold on!

07:40.169 --> 07:42.581
I got it. We're back up!
Weapon armed, sir.

07:42.671 --> 07:43.911

gonna pull it.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.790
Do it.

using your power.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.452
(COUGHS)

09:11.760 --> 09:14.046
Almost got
the order ready.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.511
You have a lot
of pickups today?

09:16.682 --> 09:18.638
I'm not here
for a pickup.

09:19.810 --> 09:20.925
No?

09:22.104 --> 09:23.310
It's me.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.725

09:27.401 --> 09:28.732
Your son.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.191
Is that so?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.408
That is so.

09:40.122 --> 09:42.204
What brings you
all the way out here?

09:43.584 --> 09:45.540
I had some questions
about myself.

09:47.504 --> 09:51.292
Who I am,
where I came from.

09:53.969 --> 09:58.338
But then I remembered.
You abandoned me.

09:59.892 --> 10:01.507
You killed my mother.

10:02.311 --> 10:05.348
So, what now?

10:05.856 --> 10:07.096
Now?

10:08.442 --> 10:09.807
I kill you.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.487
Go right ahead.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.236
(COUGHS)

10:25.959 --> 10:29.952
You kill me,
or the cancer does.

10:31.215 --> 10:34.207
Either way, I die.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.836
I haven't got all day.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.515
Anything?
This guy's good.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.566
There's no sign
the system was
even breached.

10:53.654 --> 10:54.985
I wanna know
how the hell he's

10:55.072 --> 10:56.403
getting inside,
and I want a name.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.025
NATHAN: Me, too.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.536
So we can thank them
for saving us
from this disaster.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.030
Of course.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.736
Since the safety of
your friends and family

11:04.915 --> 11:06.530
evidently trumps
national security.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.788
Parkman wasn't
a threat until you
strapped a bomb to him.

11:09.878 --> 11:13.245
Parkman and your brother
exposed our operation,
so I handled it,

11:13.340 --> 11:15.501
put a face to
the terrorist threat.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.672
People could have died.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.749
People have died, Senator.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.551
Or don't
my men count?

11:19.638 --> 11:21.674
l was brought in
to get this job done.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.010
I'd let go of that
if I were you.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.800
You're relieved
of command.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.269
I answer to
the president.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.768
If you try to
get rid of me,
he's gonna want proof,

11:31.859 --> 11:34.225
and right now it's
my word against yours.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.810
Good luck getting
any of my people
to turn on me.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.900
We'll see.
Excuse me.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.443
Bennet, you have
a minute?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.032
I'm not sure how
much I can tell you
about what happened.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.988
I know what
happened last night.

11:48.584 --> 11:51.792
I wanna talk to you
about putting a team
together once Danko's gone.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.164
You're gonna head...

11:53.255 --> 11:54.620
TRACY ON TV:
You’re one of us, Nathan!

11:54.840 --> 11:56.171
You’re one of us!

11:58.010 --> 12:00.752
You’re one of us, Nathan!
You’re one of us!

12:00.846 --> 12:02.086
Do you have a point?

12:02.180 --> 12:06.048
That maybe this operation's
been compromised
from the start.

12:06.643 --> 12:10.352
The Petrelli family
has a lot of skeletons
in their closet, Senator.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.139
I think we both
know what yours is.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.767
So,

12:16.862 --> 12:19.854
looks like we're
both building a case
against each other.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.732
Let's see who
gets there first.

12:24.286 --> 12:27.995
You’re one of us, Nathan.
You’re one of us!

13:14.878 --> 13:16.493
The son of a bitch
went over my head.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.125
What did you expect?
You backed a wild dog
into a corner.

13:19.216 --> 13:20.581
I had to act.
But you didn't act.

13:20.676 --> 13:22.337
All you did was
show Danko your hand.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.542
And frankly,
you put both
of us at risk.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.752
l have a plan, Noah.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.256
Nathan, listen to me.

13:26.682 --> 13:29.549
He's pushing
your buttons so that
you'll make a mistake.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.474
Take a play from
your mother's book.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.176
Keep your head.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.143
(DOOR UNLOCKS)

13:47.619 --> 13:49.325
Sorry about all this.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.287

hard to believe.

you back here

13:53.750 --> 13:54.956
is gonna come in,
in a few moments,

13:55.043 --> 13:56.374
and ask you
some questions.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.122
l was wondering
when that was
gonna happen.

13:58.213 --> 14:00.704

seem hard to believe,
but I still care about you.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.209

you're smarter
than that.

14:07.055 --> 14:10.718

but I have been helping
you out all along.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.175

14:14.021 --> 14:16.478
And doing
a fabulous job of it.

jumped off the bridge,
and lwas there?

the same guy.

for your own personal gain.

have to like me.

understand that I am
your last hope.

you meant when you said
he was one of us.

15:41.525 --> 15:44.562

I can take any more
surprise guests.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.705

why I was thinking

16:45.922 --> 16:47.503
that I should have
a coverjob.

16:47.591 --> 16:48.922

they're probably

16:49.092 --> 16:50.457

for you and Lyle.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.186

17:45.273 --> 17:48.936
Do you throw caution
to the wind and fly off
to save the day?

17:49.027 --> 17:52.269
Or do you take
the more calculated approach

17:52.364 --> 17:55.106
and learn the whole picture
before you act?

18:00.205 --> 18:01.820
What's the answer?

18:02.666 --> 18:04.122
There isn't one.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.916

it's the question.

what type of hero
are you?

the hunt,

Of course they will,

29:03.326 --> 29:05.191
All those civilians lost.

29:05.369 --> 29:09.282
Tragic. I'm surprised
you survived, actually.

29:24.722 --> 29:29.887
You're a very
resourceful woman,
Mrs. Petrelli.

29:32.146 --> 29:34.182
(SLURPING)

29:43.324 --> 29:45.485
A man needs
a hobby.

29:45.576 --> 29:47.783
Something to
occupy the hands,

29:47.870 --> 29:52.489
to stop the mind
from thinking so much.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.416
I fix watches.

29:57.672 --> 29:58.912
Watches?

30:01.217 --> 30:03.833
I thought it would
make my father happy.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.796
How did that
work out for you?

30:12.395 --> 30:16.559
You're still clinging
to that need
for connection, huh?

30:16.649 --> 30:20.642
The only thing
people are good for
is disappointment.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.700
Is that why
you killed my mother?

30:28.661 --> 30:30.401
Why you abandoned me?

30:36.002 --> 30:37.742
I don't even remember.

30:38.129 --> 30:39.915
It didn't matter to me.

30:40.381 --> 30:42.372
So few things do.

30:43.384 --> 30:44.965
Well, now what?

30:45.594 --> 30:47.175
Cut the thread.

30:49.807 --> 30:51.047
Go on.

30:56.981 --> 30:58.687
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

31:17.084 --> 31:18.699
How did you do that?

31:22.256 --> 31:26.215
It's just an ability
I picked up from
a cheerleader in California.

31:29.764 --> 31:32.005
I guess not
everybody gets old.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.600
Not everybody dies.

31:38.731 --> 31:42.064
Then you just have
that much longer
to suffer, don't you?

31:48.783 --> 31:50.819
(COUGHING)

31:59.752 --> 32:01.538
Get that. It needs
to settle. Over there,

32:01.629 --> 32:03.836
on that cabinet,
if you don't mind.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.663
Sure.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.232
What the hell
are you doing?

32:22.316 --> 32:26.935
It's amazing how
it comes right back,
that desire, that hunger.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.065
You think this
is gonna stop me?

32:29.949 --> 32:31.280
You think you
can beat me?

32:31.367 --> 32:33.483
I want that power!

32:34.995 --> 32:37.782
(WHISTLING)

32:55.683 --> 32:57.548
I thought
you'd given up.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.010
Yeah, well, me, too.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.016
Then why bother?
What's the point?

33:03.107 --> 33:05.598
Immortality.
You're my second chance.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.809
At what?
Killing again?

33:09.530 --> 33:12.021
You said
it was meaningless.

33:12.116 --> 33:13.652
It was.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.609
Then why make
the same mistake twice?

33:16.704 --> 33:19.446
Becauselnget
it right this time.

I can.

No,no,no.
Of course not.

No, don't leave.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.267
Like I said,
I came here to kill you.

35:03.811 --> 35:05.847
I got the answers
I wanted.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.057
Now I know exactly
what I need to do.

35:11.485 --> 35:12.691
Kill me.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.399
Oh, you're gonna die.

35:16.907 --> 35:23.119
Slowly, painfully and alone
with your sickness.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.990
Please, don't.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.584
I'm sorry.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.541
You're just small game.

35:49.565 --> 35:53.149
Turns out the President
didn't really need
that much proof after all.

35:54.528 --> 35:57.486
It's a signed document.
You're finished.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.655
You lose me,
you lose the whole team.

36:00.743 --> 36:02.859
That's a risk
I'm prepared to take.

36:02.953 --> 36:05.911
In fact, anyone
who's not on board
can step out now.

36:09.209 --> 36:13.543
You're hitting reset
on the whole operation
just because of me?

36:13.630 --> 36:15.916
I think it's time
things were done correctly.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.002
You may have
friends now, Petrelli,

36:22.097 --> 36:24.679
but one day,
you're gonna find
yourself all alone.

36:31.565 --> 36:33.806
You went to
the President?
Mmm-hmm.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.433
And he's eager to meet
Danko's replacement.

36:42.534 --> 36:43.944
Coming?

36:54.380 --> 36:55.916
So, you're the man
with the plan.

36:56.006 --> 36:58.497
I sure hope you have
something good to share
with the President.

36:58.592 --> 37:01.379
It's a bit unorthodox,
but it's tested.

37:09.895 --> 37:13.934
Look, it's over.
Just let it go.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.357
When are you
gonna understand?

37:17.444 --> 37:22.108
Bureaucracy, oversight,
rules of conduct,

37:22.991 --> 37:25.152
none of it applies
in my world.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.863
I don't know
what your world is,

37:28.038 --> 37:30.029
but it ought to
be shut down.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.699
Danko, take it easy.

37:34.628 --> 37:38.837
I've seen what
these people can do
and it scares me.

37:40.134 --> 37:44.628
And the thing about you,
Senator, is that
through all this,

37:45.180 --> 37:47.842
you've never once
shown an ounce of fear.

37:49.351 --> 37:53.720
I wonder, why is that?

37:59.361 --> 38:00.942
I don't have time
for this.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.454
Tell me you didn't
know about this.

This is it,
your new identity.

to start over.

any trace of
Eric Doyle.

that agent's life,
is that it?

Have I earned
your help?

38:52.206 --> 38:53.742
This isn't about you.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.244
This is about me,
about who I need

38:56.335 --> 38:58.826
to be right now,
and I don't...

39:05.344 --> 39:06.800
Just take it.

Thanks, Barbie.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.806
Did you mean
all that stuff you said?

39:21.860 --> 39:24.101
About how you changed?

the service two hours
to find a replacement?

Well, don'tjust
stand there. Come in.

for Matt Parkman.

but that won't hold.

40:32.598 --> 40:33.838

40:35.350 --> 40:37.602
Takeit
No, thank you.

40:37.686 --> 40:38.846
Now!

40:41.607 --> 40:43.017
Hey, wait!

40:43.692 --> 40:45.853
We are here to
save Matt Parkman.

40:46.028 --> 40:47.143
Uh-huh.

40:47.487 --> 40:50.524
You're holding him.

each other’s triumphs.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.719
For how do we see the world
if not through their lens?

41:21.855 --> 41:24.722
The same fears,
the same desires.

41:26.068 --> 41:28.354
Do we see them as
an example to follow,

41:29.571 --> 41:31.778
or as a warning
of what to avoid?

41:34.409 --> 41:38.618
Choosing to live as
they have simply because
it’s what we know,

41:39.373 --> 41:42.456
or driven to create
our own identity?

41:43.794 --> 41:47.082
And what happens
if we find them
to be a disappointment?

41:48.924 --> 41:50.539
Can we replace them?

41:51.134 --> 41:53.045
Our mothers, our fathers?

41:53.553 --> 41:56.215
Or will destiny find
a way to drive us back,

41:56.306 --> 41:59.890
back to the familiar
comforts of home?
