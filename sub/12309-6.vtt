00:00.634 --> 00:02.651
You can go ahead, rodney.

00:03.021 --> 00:05.352
- I don't remember where to start.
- Sure you do.

00:05.531 --> 00:06.281
No.

00:06.328 --> 00:10.570
Start with your name like we've been doing, okay, and we'll just go from there.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.152
My name...

00:12.270 --> 00:14.977
my name is...

00:15.434 --> 00:16.980
Mr.Rodney mckay.

00:17.016 --> 00:17.824
No...

00:17.848 --> 00:18.680
yes.

00:18.738 --> 00:21.539
Come on, now. You're Dr.Mckay, remember?

00:21.562 --> 00:23.883
No, I'm-- I'm not anymore.

00:23.884 --> 00:27.760
I'm not s-s-smart anymore.

00:27.842 --> 00:31.123
Doctors are smart, so I'm mister now.

00:31.252 --> 00:32.634
Okay.

00:34.979 --> 00:37.780
I used to be the smartest person ever...

00:37.885 --> 00:40.956
and-- and now... now I'm not.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.906
That's what we're trying to fix, right?

00:44.140 --> 00:45.499
No, you can't fix me.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.667
You know we're trying our very best--

00:47.726 --> 00:49.988
no, you can'T. You can'T.

00:49.989 --> 00:51.007
it's okay, rodney,

00:51.008 --> 00:52.824
what's the next thing you're supposed to say?

00:52.825 --> 00:54.945
Where... where did john go?

00:55.027 --> 00:56.667
He just had to go away for a few minutes. He'll be back--

00:56.668 --> 00:57.898
- john!
- Rodney...

00:58.619 --> 01:00.131
rodney, I'm your friend, I'm right here.

01:00.132 --> 01:02.439
Where are you, john?

01:03.260 --> 01:04.537
John!

01:08.666 --> 01:11.795
Why the hell didn't you tell me my brother was this far gone?

01:12.182 --> 01:13.576
It's happened pretty fast, jeannie.

01:13.611 --> 01:15.064
No, I...

01:15.557 --> 01:18.709
I got a message from him just a couple of weeks ago.

01:18.826 --> 01:21.779
he seemed perfectly fine. He'd never been so nice.

01:22.107 --> 01:25.799
That would have been shortly after he became infected.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.564
I didn't recognize the symptoms in time.

01:28.576 --> 01:30.416
It's not your fault, doc.

01:30.486 --> 01:32.514
Frankly, mrs. Miller,

01:32.607 --> 01:36.791
 we contacted you as soon as we became aware of the seriousness of his condition.

01:37.095 --> 01:42.205
In fact, daedalus dropped you off at the first available gate in pegasus because we were concerned that

01:42.299 --> 01:44.666
you wouldn't make it here in time.

01:45.275 --> 01:49.799
We thought you deserved a chance to say goodbye.

03:05.393 --> 03:09.319
Dr.Keller wanted to take a moment to prepare him for your visit.

03:09.366 --> 03:10.995
Yeah, I, uh...

03:11.206 --> 03:13.796
I think I need a moment myself.

03:14.042 --> 03:16.784
How did... how did this happen to him?

03:17.499 --> 03:22.186
Um, there was a little snafu on the last mission.

03:23.741 --> 03:25.898
Colonel sheppard, when you reach the research camp,

03:25.899 --> 03:28.839
please remind Dr.Nichols that he is now...

03:28.991 --> 03:32.144
one hour and 15 minutes overdue for his scheduled check-in.

03:32.226 --> 03:35.261
Right, want me to smack him around or anything?

03:39.152 --> 03:41.261
Just the reminder, please.

03:42.983 --> 03:45.350
Shouldn't we be concerned for Dr.Nichols' team?

03:45.351 --> 03:47.600
No, the settlement's a half hour away from the gate.

03:47.601 --> 03:49.721
He's got them checking in every six.

03:49.791 --> 03:52.077
I'm sure nichols is just tired of taking the round trip.

03:52.078 --> 03:53.987
Still, it wouldn't hurt to bust his chops a bit.

03:53.988 --> 03:56.623
That nichols is so arrogant.

04:05.350 --> 04:10.002
Amelia, I think I'm going to risk heading down to breakfast before they check in.

04:10.787 --> 04:12.241
I just mean that...

04:12.522 --> 04:16.237
it will probably take them some time to get to the camp,

04:16.588 --> 04:21.041
and then more time for nichols to get back to the gate and report.

04:21.076 --> 04:23.479
There's really no point in my...

04:24.346 --> 04:25.576
telling you this.

04:25.846 --> 04:27.053
Not really, sir.

04:27.123 --> 04:28.401
Right.

04:30.006 --> 04:31.916
Be back in 20 minutes.

04:33.453 --> 04:35.726
Unscheduled offworld activation!

04:36.172 --> 04:38.410
Activate the shield.

04:42.272 --> 04:44.510
I'm not receiving an idc.

04:44.627 --> 04:47.311
This is sheppard. Do not lower the shield.

04:47.312 --> 04:48.998
The entire tower will be flooded.

04:49.115 --> 04:50.838
I have no intention of doing that, colonel.

04:50.839 --> 04:52.291
What's your status?

04:52.584 --> 04:55.057
It's cold and wet. The stargate's underwater.

04:55.197 --> 04:56.463
The entire valley's flooded.

04:56.510 --> 04:58.186
And it's freezing!

04:58.362 --> 05:02.662
We need you to send a jumper through so we can stay warm and dry until the water recedes.

05:03.905 --> 05:05.920
Will do, colonel, hold on.

05:06.002 --> 05:08.264
Holding on. Sheppard out.

05:16.337 --> 05:18.177
Rescue one is standing by.

05:19.958 --> 05:20.837
What's taking so long?

05:20.896 --> 05:22.748
Why isn't the gate disengaging?

05:26.546 --> 05:27.390
It's the water.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.968
The constant pressure's forcing the wormhole to stay active,

05:30.050 --> 05:32.745
which means we're going to have to wait the maximum amount of time a stargate can stay open.

05:32.746 --> 05:33.964
38 minutes.

05:34.117 --> 05:38.066
Well, we're down to 32, and before you say I told you so, we had no choice.

05:38.113 --> 05:39.929
I can't stop shivering.

05:39.988 --> 05:42.437
You're letting all the hot air out of your mouth.

05:42.519 --> 05:45.472
All right, everybody, you'll be warm soon enough.

05:45.531 --> 05:48.331
I don't know, I think I got wetter than you did.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.859
I don't know, I golea litt damp dialing the dhd.

05:51.941 --> 05:53.968
The research camp was farther up this valley.

05:54.050 --> 05:56.113
I'm a little concerned r Dr.Nichols' team.

05:56.382 --> 05:57.589
Right.

05:59.406 --> 06:02.453
Anyone at the research camp, this is colonel sheppard. Please respond.

06:06.613 --> 06:09.460
I repeat, this is colonel sheppard. Please respond.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.012
I'm pretty sure they're all dead.

06:11.013 --> 06:12.571
We can't know that, rodney.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.832
Look, the research team was studying the effects of global warming.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.715
They set up camp at the foot of a massive glacier up the valley.

06:17.716 --> 06:19.239
You think an ice dam broke?

06:19.240 --> 06:20.410
It fits.

06:20.504 --> 06:25.215
The ancients don't put stargates on a flood plain, and I certainly don't think the tide just came in.

06:25.379 --> 06:27.676
It explains why the water's so freezing.

06:31.496 --> 06:32.633
Aw, okay...

06:32.949 --> 06:35.657
okay, so now I'm hot, and I'm still shivering.

06:36.711 --> 06:38.469
Were you running a fever before we left?

06:38.470 --> 06:41.926
I don't know, maybe. I'm always running something.

06:44.668 --> 06:48.032
All right, I think the water's receded a little.

06:48.219 --> 06:50.469
So we're going to be stuck here all night.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.891
In the back of a warm, cozy jumper, all right?

06:53.961 --> 06:58.239
All you need to do is hold on for, I don't know, 30 minutes or so...

07:11.405 --> 07:12.765
how long has he been unresponsive?

07:12.952 --> 07:15.214
Since he fell asleep in the jumper. About nine hours.

07:15.215 --> 07:17.241
Okay, let's get him to the infirmary. I want him under a scanner.

07:17.242 --> 07:19.550
I want to have a look at you guys, too.

07:19.643 --> 07:20.604
We're good.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.890
By that I mean now.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.808
I think you've just made a case for my proposal

07:25.809 --> 07:28.128
to send a malp ahead of every single transit.

07:28.210 --> 07:29.968
Stuff happens, woolsey, and by "stuff,"

07:30.003 --> 07:32.124
I mean-- I know what you mean, thank you.

07:32.206 --> 07:34.128
Why didn't you return in the jumper I sent you?

07:34.245 --> 07:37.526
Well, I ordered the rescue party to continue the search for nichols' team.

07:37.527 --> 07:39.237
There's a chance they're still alive.

07:39.545 --> 07:40.353
Of course.

07:40.354 --> 07:44.338
I got to go get checked out, and then, uh, I'm going to check on rodney.

07:51.954 --> 07:54.063
Well, how's our boy?

07:54.157 --> 07:57.426
No fever, no hypothermia, nothing on the scan at all.

07:57.427 --> 07:58.229
How about you guys?

07:58.230 --> 07:59.706
Like I said, we're good.

07:59.741 --> 08:02.331
Yeah, yeah. But we're not the ones who became unconscious.

08:02.332 --> 08:05.589
Well, I didn't really get much sleep the night before, and I did skimp on breakfast, so...

08:05.823 --> 08:08.823
you know, woolsey wants to send out a malp before every transit now.

08:08.824 --> 08:11.026
- Well, that's going to get old fast.
- That's what I said.

08:11.425 --> 08:14.085
Hey, can I go now? I feel a little silly lying here.

08:14.086 --> 08:16.745
I'm keeping you under observation for a little longer.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.870
Besides, I ordered you dinner.

08:17.871 --> 08:19.780
Well, then you can observe me eat, because I'm famished.

08:19.781 --> 08:21.948
It's official. He's better.

08:22.007 --> 08:23.566
See you guys.

08:25.687 --> 08:27.030
Do you want me to send them in?

08:27.147 --> 08:28.377
Okay.

08:34.897 --> 08:37.076
Rodney's all ready for you.

08:39.537 --> 08:41.412
What am I supposed to say?

08:43.604 --> 08:45.865
Doesn't matter.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.629
Meredith?

09:04.633 --> 09:06.097
It's me. It's jeannie, mere. I'm--

09:06.098 --> 09:07.902
you're my sister.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.363
Yes.

09:10.457 --> 09:12.437
Meredith's my...

09:13.773 --> 09:14.804
real name.

09:14.980 --> 09:17.429
It's your first name, that's right,

09:17.711 --> 09:19.527
but you never liked it.

09:19.586 --> 09:20.746
No.

09:21.097 --> 09:22.867
No, it'S...

09:23.441 --> 09:25.433
a girl's name.

09:26.910 --> 09:28.961
Sometimes, yes,

09:30.320 --> 09:32.218
but you go by rodney.

09:32.465 --> 09:33.976
Rodney mckay,

09:34.187 --> 09:36.449
Mr.Rodney mckay.

09:36.988 --> 09:40.234
Rodney mckay, rodney mckay...

09:44.353 --> 09:47.118
you're crying because of me.

09:47.857 --> 09:51.712
No, I'm crying because I've missed you very much.

09:51.806 --> 09:53.915
'Cause you're my sister.

09:54.173 --> 09:56.318
That's right.

09:57.818 --> 09:59.271
I'M...

09:59.927 --> 10:01.017
sick.

10:01.333 --> 10:02.529
I know.

10:03.665 --> 10:04.861
I know.

10:05.775 --> 10:07.427
I'm here now.

10:09.583 --> 10:10.544
I...

10:12.021 --> 10:14.318
sweetie, I just need to go outside for one second, okay?

10:14.319 --> 10:17.072
I will be right back, I promise.

10:21.881 --> 10:23.316
- Hey...
- I know.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.427
I just need a second.

10:27.428 --> 10:29.232
I just don't want him to see.

10:29.267 --> 10:30.485
I know how you feel.

10:30.708 --> 10:33.175
- I felt the same way.
- I'll go back in, I will.

10:33.620 --> 10:36.456
He needs me, and I want to be able to say goodbye, but it's like...

10:36.526 --> 10:38.964
- it's like he's already gone.
- I know.

10:41.512 --> 10:42.942
There's a way.

10:44.328 --> 10:45.769
What? How?

10:46.027 --> 10:47.914
There's a place. I've been there before.

10:47.984 --> 10:51.066
He'll be himself again, and you can say goodbye.

10:51.968 --> 10:54.089
I don't understand, then why haven't you already taken him?

10:54.090 --> 10:55.308
Because it's dangerous,

10:56.351 --> 10:58.355
but I'm willing to risk it if you are.

11:04.592 --> 11:05.635
all set?

11:06.490 --> 11:09.268
Remind me to register a complaint with whose ever idea this was.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.986
It was yours, actually.

11:11.987 --> 11:13.111
Oh, ho ho...

11:13.182 --> 11:15.326
well, complaint duly registered.

11:15.327 --> 11:18.314
It was a good idea to keep a record of what's happening to you

11:18.315 --> 11:20.377
- and how fast, but if you'd rather not--
- no, it's fine. It's fine.

11:20.424 --> 11:21.666
My name, right?

11:21.667 --> 11:22.487
Right.

11:22.569 --> 11:24.830
Hey, I remembered something. Yay!

11:25.440 --> 11:26.670
My name is Dr.Rodney mckay.

11:26.729 --> 11:32.201
I'm head of the department of science something in atlantis in the, um...

11:35.612 --> 11:36.784
for god's sake...

11:37.218 --> 11:38.226
in the pegasus galaxy.

11:38.366 --> 11:40.616
Okay, not bad, keep going.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.913
Jennifer, there'S...

11:43.429 --> 11:45.573
there's something I wanted to, um...

11:46.429 --> 11:50.940
you know, while I remember, while I still can, something I wanted to say...

11:51.585 --> 11:52.909
go ahead.

11:56.034 --> 11:57.874
Jeannie, uh...

11:58.061 --> 12:00.569
I wasn't expecting anyone this late.

12:00.979 --> 12:04.881
Yeah, I'm kind of one of those people who needs all the information they can get.

12:07.471 --> 12:10.260
This is his most recent scan.

12:10.778 --> 12:13.754
This dark area that looks like a tumor

12:13.766 --> 12:15.946
is actually a parasitic organism.

12:16.039 --> 12:19.942
Its tendrils spread far beyond any hope of surgical extraction,

12:19.943 --> 12:22.133
and it's not responding to treatment.

12:22.145 --> 12:24.594
Even stasis barely slowed its progression.

12:24.595 --> 12:27.043
There are still a number of drug combinations that--

12:27.044 --> 12:29.364
he was infected somehow on his last mission?

12:29.504 --> 12:32.270
Well, maybe, but not necessarily.

12:32.271 --> 12:35.778
It was too small to show up on a scan at the time,

12:36.212 --> 12:41.216
but in the pegasus galaxy, the condition is fairly common among the very old.

12:41.217 --> 12:43.536
Right, so why him?

12:44.157 --> 12:47.216
It's possible we're all exposed to it and fight it off.

12:47.497 --> 12:52.068
Rodney was already suffering from a viral infection when he went on the mission at m44 5y9,

12:52.069 --> 12:54.985
and then all that time in freezing water--

12:54.986 --> 12:57.189
so his resistance was low.

12:58.958 --> 13:03.142
The parasite doesn't so much as kill cells as render them dormant

13:03.224 --> 13:07.021
for reasons I still don't completely understand, but

13:07.384 --> 13:10.888
the net result is ever-diminishing brain function.

13:10.958 --> 13:14.837
As it spreads, he'll lose motor control, regulation of organ function--

13:14.872 --> 13:18.083
ronon's people call the disease "second childhood."

13:19.501 --> 13:21.458
- You talked to ronon.
- Yes.

13:21.686 --> 13:23.631
Okay, I know what he's told you.

13:23.632 --> 13:25.663
That he's dying, and there's nothing you can do.

13:25.664 --> 13:30.093
No, he's dying, and I'm doing everything I can.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.202
I have to ask you...

13:32.753 --> 13:35.682
why did you tell me you didn't recognize the symptoms in time?

13:36.444 --> 13:40.956
Because he was already showing the symptoms when he came back from the mission, and...

13:41.401 --> 13:43.276
I didn't see it.

13:44.788 --> 13:45.843
So?

13:46.077 --> 13:47.284
Just what the doctor ordered.

13:48.222 --> 13:49.030
Funny.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.472
You want my fruit cup?

13:50.779 --> 13:51.740
No, no, no.

13:51.741 --> 13:53.158
I think you do.

13:53.390 --> 13:56.085
Eating from the patient's tray is kind of frowned upon.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.609
Jennifer, we practically dated.

13:57.679 --> 13:59.413
You bought me one drink. That's hardly dating.

13:59.414 --> 14:01.874
Right, so now I'm asking you to have dinner with me.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.491
I mean, such as it is.

14:06.163 --> 14:07.722
I do love the fruit cup.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.148
Not that this is exactly the dinner I had in mind, but...

14:10.479 --> 14:11.674
is that an invitation?

14:11.675 --> 14:13.584
Only if you promise to accept.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.110
If I wasn't so taken by the new rodney mckay

14:20.111 --> 14:24.914
the parasite might've been small enough for me to operate without causing significant brain trauma.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.227
By the time he started to forget, it was too late.

14:31.184 --> 14:34.383
I haven't given up on trying to find a treatment--

14:34.384 --> 14:39.326
ronon told me about this place that could give mere one more day as himself again before he dies.

14:39.327 --> 14:40.870
Jeannie, you can't possibly believe--

14:40.871 --> 14:43.062
and that you're the one who won't let him go.

14:44.714 --> 14:46.156
It's on a planet called talus.

14:46.157 --> 14:48.675
It's one of the original worlds of the ancestors.

14:48.874 --> 14:51.429
It took us about five or six hours to get there from the gate,

14:51.534 --> 14:54.863
but I was just a kid, and my grandfather had to be carried most of the way.

14:54.864 --> 14:57.077
We could do it in about half that time.

14:57.218 --> 14:59.949
There's a small problem with that plan.

15:00.511 --> 15:04.695
The wraith established a major outpost there during the replicator war.

15:04.859 --> 15:05.925
It's still there.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.558
Yeah, well, that's never stopped us from going anywhere we needed to go before.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.089
Well, it's not just that.

15:12.195 --> 15:13.495
You don't believe it's real.

15:13.601 --> 15:15.570
- I'm not saying--
- I am, actually.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.701
I was there.

15:16.724 --> 15:18.857
Yes, but you were six years old.

15:19.150 --> 15:21.916
Ronon, listen to what you've told us--

15:21.951 --> 15:25.279
a magical shrine, inside a cave, behind a waterfall--

15:25.326 --> 15:26.545
did I say it was magic?

15:26.556 --> 15:30.564
No, but you did say that people afflicted with mckay's condition

15:30.565 --> 15:33.459
suddenly revert to their former selves for...

15:33.658 --> 15:36.564
the shrine of talus is also known among my people,

15:36.565 --> 15:38.896
for victims of the second childhood.

15:39.013 --> 15:43.185
It offers the gift of one last day, and a quick death.

15:43.227 --> 15:44.984
That doesn't necessarily make it real.

15:44.996 --> 15:49.848
I'm telling you that in a matter of seconds I saw my grandfather go from someone who couldn't speak his own name,

15:50.229 --> 15:52.268
to the man that taught me how to track and hunt.

15:52.737 --> 15:54.975
You learned to hunt when you were six years old?

16:00.995 --> 16:02.378
For one day,

16:02.624 --> 16:06.093
he got to hold his wife in his arms, and share a meal with the people that he loved,

16:06.187 --> 16:07.558
and then he died with honor.

16:08.109 --> 16:10.241
You can say I was too young to remember,

16:10.534 --> 16:11.589
but I know what I saw,

16:11.695 --> 16:14.073
and we can do the same thing for mckay.

16:17.296 --> 16:19.019
If you think that's not worth it,

16:20.343 --> 16:22.101
you're wrong.

16:26.769 --> 16:30.390
I've never told anyone this, outside of...

16:32.820 --> 16:35.363
my father had a disease called alzheimer'S.

16:35.445 --> 16:40.261
It's similar in many respects to the condition that Dr.Mckay is suffering from.

16:40.331 --> 16:45.605
My point is, I had a similar moment with him to the one you just described.

16:45.874 --> 16:49.636
He hadn't recognized me, literally, for months,

16:49.718 --> 16:52.941
then one day, out of the blue,

16:53.784 --> 16:56.234
he had a moment of absolute clarity.

16:56.327 --> 16:59.843
He said "richard, what are you doing here?"

17:00.019 --> 17:01.777
And I said,

17:02.023 --> 17:06.406
"dad, I, uh, I'm here to see you,"

17:06.499 --> 17:08.186
and he said...

17:09.675 --> 17:12.616
he said, "isn't that wonderful,"

17:13.894 --> 17:16.132
and then he was gone again.

17:17.382 --> 17:20.698
- Now, couldn't you be remembering a similar--
- it's not the same.

17:20.826 --> 17:22.748
- Ronon, look--
- I owe him this!

17:24.810 --> 17:26.299
- I'll take him myself.
- I'll go with him.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.728
Hold on, hold on.

17:29.545 --> 17:33.553
We know for a fact there are two hive ships and 10,000 wraith on the ground.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.744
If we're even going to consider this,

17:35.803 --> 17:39.201
all right, we have to make a plan.

17:39.342 --> 17:40.139
Fine, make your plan.

17:40.140 --> 17:43.666
I'm sorry, but he's not going anywhere without my permission,

17:43.667 --> 17:48.564
and you won't get that until we talk to rodney.

17:57.419 --> 17:58.650
Hey, rodney...

17:59.482 --> 18:02.130
you got some visitors. John's here.

18:02.529 --> 18:04.146
So are teyla and ronon.

18:04.147 --> 18:06.080
The whole team.

18:06.537 --> 18:07.685
Ronon dex.

18:07.908 --> 18:09.642
That's right, buddy.

18:09.947 --> 18:11.541
I want to take you to a place,

18:11.658 --> 18:15.607
a place that's going to give you a chance to be yourself again for a little while.

18:20.779 --> 18:23.157
As you were before you became ill.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.579
Before...

18:31.208 --> 18:32.216
hey, pal.

18:32.239 --> 18:34.349
Hey, j-john.

18:36.212 --> 18:38.579
Truth is, we don'T...

18:38.931 --> 18:40.970
know exactly what's going to happen to you,

18:40.971 --> 18:43.794
but we're willing to try, if you are.

18:44.263 --> 18:45.751
Okay.

18:46.161 --> 18:49.032
Okay. Okay, well, that settles it, then.

18:49.126 --> 18:50.532
No, it doesn'T.

18:50.626 --> 18:53.509
Rodney, they haven't told you everything.

18:53.510 --> 18:54.481
He doesn't need to know.

18:54.482 --> 18:56.333
The planet they want to take you to

18:56.532 --> 18:57.868
is a wraith outpost.

18:57.869 --> 18:59.661
You remember who the wraith are?

19:00.024 --> 19:03.610
It means going will be very, very dangerous,

19:03.611 --> 19:05.157
not just for you,

19:05.427 --> 19:06.505
but for your friends.

19:06.506 --> 19:07.829
We're willing to take that risk.

19:07.911 --> 19:10.794
A risk for which, and I'm sorry--

19:10.795 --> 19:14.509
even if it works, which i very much doubt--

19:16.044 --> 19:19.478
you might revert to your former self for one day.

19:19.630 --> 19:23.169
Now, forgive me if that sounds more like torture than a blessing.

19:23.251 --> 19:26.638
We're still coming up with new ideas on how to treat this thing,

19:26.755 --> 19:30.798
but if you do this, if you leave atlantis...

19:30.904 --> 19:32.298
atlantis...

19:33.048 --> 19:34.560
it's over.

19:35.755 --> 19:37.619
I can't help you.

19:43.768 --> 19:45.034
Doctor...

19:49.969 --> 19:51.563
he doesn't understand.

19:51.564 --> 19:53.543
No, he doesn't,

19:54.012 --> 19:58.734
which means the decision on whether or not to let him go is mine,

20:00.070 --> 20:03.316
and I haven't given up on trying to cure my patient.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.893
And you still haven't given up.

20:15.444 --> 20:18.210
No, because I don't think the damage to the cells is permanent,

20:18.211 --> 20:22.335
which means if I can to safely remove the parasite-- how long have you been at it?

20:22.336 --> 20:23.530
Weeks?

20:23.694 --> 20:27.315
And how many days does he have left? Two at most?

20:27.631 --> 20:30.561
Look, I know you've done everything you can.

20:30.596 --> 20:34.546
I know you feel responsible, and you want to keep trying, but...

20:34.862 --> 20:36.549
I'm his next of kin.

20:36.655 --> 20:38.507
That makes the decision mine.

20:39.983 --> 20:41.928
And we're taking him.

20:45.688 --> 20:47.235
It's recording.

20:48.173 --> 20:49.520
Well, aren't you supposed to say, "action" or something?

20:49.521 --> 20:50.868
Oh, sorry.

20:50.915 --> 20:52.181
I'm kidding.

20:52.427 --> 20:54.970
Okay, here we go.

20:55.976 --> 20:57.593
My name is Dr.Rodney mckay.

20:57.652 --> 21:02.374
I am head of the science and research departments here in atlantis,

21:02.480 --> 21:05.527
in the pegasus galaxy, in the local cluster,

21:05.609 --> 21:07.800
in the universe as we know it.

21:08.937 --> 21:13.226
The purpose of this log is to provide a baseline for myself,

21:13.496 --> 21:17.937
and for Dr.Keller, to monitor the progress of my, um...

21:20.703 --> 21:22.425
memory loss.

21:23.656 --> 21:25.109
Ironic, isn't it?

21:26.058 --> 21:27.898
By reciting the aforementioned,

21:27.899 --> 21:30.699
as well as a list of things I know like the back of my hand,

21:30.839 --> 21:34.613
starting with pi, to, say, 12 decimals.

21:34.730 --> 21:38.316
3.1415926535...

21:39.640 --> 21:41.023
rodney on board?

21:41.024 --> 21:41.867
Yes.

21:42.066 --> 21:43.601
Are we clear on the rules of engagement?

21:43.602 --> 21:45.347
We'll get in and get out before the wraith even know it.

21:45.348 --> 21:46.871
Colonel sheppard,

21:47.740 --> 21:50.916
if in fact Dr.Mckay does regain his...

21:52.733 --> 21:54.479
say goodbye for me.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.266
I thought you didn't believe.

22:03.313 --> 22:05.070
Is that a prerequisite?

22:09.016 --> 22:10.738
He'll be glad you're here.

22:13.265 --> 22:16.077
All right, we're either going to get away with this, or we're not.

22:16.147 --> 22:19.007
If we don't, the ride's going to wild, and it's is going to be fast,

22:19.112 --> 22:20.858
so I need everyone prepared.

22:20.987 --> 22:23.354
Jumper three, standing by.

22:23.355 --> 22:25.405
Send the malp through.

22:37.155 --> 22:42.944
The malp is clear of the gate, and they're firing on it from both sides of what appears to be a deep valley.

22:44.123 --> 22:45.822
It's deploying smoke.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.693
You should have complete coverage of the area in five seconds.

22:48.904 --> 22:50.896
Okay, see you tomorrow.

22:51.002 --> 22:52.935
I hope so.

23:11.525 --> 23:13.271
That's one hell of a valley.

23:13.365 --> 23:15.510
Do you think they detected us before we were able to cloak?

23:15.511 --> 23:17.654
No, I think the smokescreen worked.

23:17.736 --> 23:21.111
Hopefully they think we just sent a malp through ahead of us

23:21.193 --> 23:24.369
and changed our mind when they blew it up.

23:27.545 --> 23:29.678
All right, I'm going to do a sweep of the landing area.

23:29.679 --> 23:31.400
Shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

23:33.146 --> 23:35.994
John, john!

23:44.231 --> 23:45.239
John!

23:46.141 --> 23:47.770
John!

23:48.602 --> 23:49.692
John!

23:49.973 --> 23:51.450
You were there, and-and then he--

23:51.451 --> 23:53.205
rodney, rodney, I'm right here.

23:53.206 --> 23:55.490
- What's wrong?
- I woke up, everyone had left!

23:55.766 --> 23:57.629
Oh... buddy, I...

23:57.630 --> 24:00.664
I'm sorry, I thought you'd fallen asleep.

24:01.731 --> 24:05.141
I was... I got so scared, I was sure that...

24:05.551 --> 24:08.387
by the morning what was left of my mind was going to be gone!

24:08.586 --> 24:10.180
I'm going to take you back to your quarters, okay?

24:10.181 --> 24:12.114
John... john, I've never been so scared.

24:12.115 --> 24:15.430
I'm slipping away. I'm slipping away, and I don't know how to stop myself!

24:15.559 --> 24:17.938
Look, you're still here. All right?

24:18.149 --> 24:19.707
You're still here.

24:19.861 --> 24:20.752
Yeah.

24:22.439 --> 24:23.728
I am.

24:26.211 --> 24:28.718
And I'm not going anywhere.

24:28.882 --> 24:31.355
You know, you want to hang out, you just...

24:31.683 --> 24:33.347
hang out.

24:33.547 --> 24:35.234
I don't know what to do.

24:35.867 --> 24:37.812
I don't know what to do with myself.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.199
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have woken you up.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.613
All right, look, it's a nice night out.

24:44.351 --> 24:45.957
Let's go have some beer on the pier, okay?

24:48.777 --> 24:49.996
I drink beer?

24:50.066 --> 24:51.250
A lot.

24:51.344 --> 24:52.398
Take this.

24:55.099 --> 24:56.786
Come on, buddy, let's go.

25:05.613 --> 25:07.277
I don't know, should I have another?

25:07.278 --> 25:09.187
What could happen?

25:11.765 --> 25:14.906
I shouldn't have banged on your door like that. I feel ridiculous.

25:15.111 --> 25:16.341
Don'T.

25:19.306 --> 25:23.490
I've been trying to remember the name of my sister's kid.

25:24.615 --> 25:25.599
Betty.

25:26.185 --> 25:27.568
Betty...

25:29.654 --> 25:31.189
pretty sure that's not it.

25:32.994 --> 25:34.494
It's madison. See?

25:34.623 --> 25:36.029
At least you remembered what it wasn'T.

25:36.030 --> 25:37.330
Oh, there's an underrated skill.

25:37.331 --> 25:39.463
I'm just saying you may not be as far gone as you think.

25:39.464 --> 25:41.115
I'm hiding it.

25:41.349 --> 25:43.974
Believe me, I've already forgotten more than most people will ever know,

25:43.975 --> 25:45.884
and I know that sounds...

25:47.174 --> 25:48.603
arrogant, is that right?

25:48.604 --> 25:50.033
Yeah.

25:50.291 --> 25:51.756
That works.

25:52.271 --> 25:56.536
This morning I was trying to help zelenka finish a device that was apparently my idea.

25:56.537 --> 25:59.713
I was useless.

26:01.705 --> 26:05.455
Jennifer says it's going to get worse now almost by the hour.

26:06.158 --> 26:10.799
In a week or so, I won't even remember my name.

26:13.681 --> 26:15.369
How's about...

26:19.638 --> 26:21.630
how about we say goodbye now?

26:21.748 --> 26:23.095
No.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.248
- What do you mean, no?
- I mean, I'm not saying goodbye.

26:26.249 --> 26:28.199
- Well, I'm saying it anyway.
- I'm not listening.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.810
- Yeah, but pretty soon I won't even know who you are.
- Then I'll remind you.

26:30.900 --> 26:32.610
But I don't want you to see me like that.

26:32.611 --> 26:35.153
I want you to remember me as I am, as your genius friend, not as some shell--

26:35.154 --> 26:36.290
not happening.

26:37.098 --> 26:39.535
Please. You're stuck with me, rodney. Just accept it.

26:39.594 --> 26:40.883
- Yeah, but--
- no!

26:42.699 --> 26:44.187
That's final.

26:48.179 --> 26:48.976
Okay.

26:51.730 --> 26:52.913
Okay.

26:58.822 --> 27:00.709
You're a good friend, arthur.

27:24.182 --> 27:26.081
All right, landing area's clear.

27:26.339 --> 27:28.366
I'm taking us in.

27:43.242 --> 27:44.613
Where are we going?

27:44.789 --> 27:46.335
Up there, do you see?

27:46.441 --> 27:48.457
Behind the waterfall, there is a cave,

27:48.585 --> 27:51.796
and when we get there, you will spend a wonderful day with your friends.

27:51.949 --> 27:53.050
I'm tired.

27:53.367 --> 27:54.316
I know.

27:54.386 --> 27:56.414
We'll be there soon.

28:30.521 --> 28:32.759
So... what do we do?

28:33.099 --> 28:34.165
We wait.

28:34.365 --> 28:35.314
Rodney...

28:35.888 --> 28:37.482
look at the waterfall. It's cool, huh?

28:37.483 --> 28:38.665
No

28:39.638 --> 28:43.083
I'm getting very faint energy readings.

28:43.212 --> 28:44.384
What kind of energy readings?

28:44.385 --> 28:45.837
I'm not sure.

28:47.150 --> 28:48.146
Look at this.

28:48.147 --> 28:49.447
Radiation?

28:49.669 --> 28:51.556
Not that I've ever seen.

28:51.557 --> 28:53.208
Maybe we can ask rodney in a minute.

28:53.267 --> 28:54.298
John!

28:54.299 --> 28:55.892
Just hang in there, buddy.

28:55.893 --> 28:57.158
I want to go home now!

28:57.181 --> 28:59.279
Perhaps he should stand closer to this tablet.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.150
I-- I don't know. I think that's the source of these energy readings.

29:02.151 --> 29:03.638
I want to go now!

29:03.767 --> 29:06.561
- A little bit longer.
- Go now!

29:18.569 --> 29:19.811
Jeannie?

29:20.268 --> 29:21.874
I'm here, mere.

29:23.245 --> 29:25.026
Yeah, obviously.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.167
He's back.

29:29.714 --> 29:32.233
Somebody please tell me what the hell we're all doing here?

29:36.177 --> 29:37.747
Rodney mckay.

29:38.298 --> 29:40.653
I'm head of science... and... and...

29:44.603 --> 29:46.279
research.

29:47.873 --> 29:48.869
It's okay.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.439
No, it is not.

29:53.322 --> 29:54.775
Atlantis...

29:56.521 --> 29:57.939
pegasus...

29:58.818 --> 30:01.478
it's 3.1...4...

30:04.820 --> 30:06.555
I don't know.

30:09.030 --> 30:10.835
How can I not know that?

30:11.128 --> 30:12.944
Do you want to stop?

30:15.722 --> 30:17.620
I keep seeing a face.

30:19.261 --> 30:21.194
Every time I close my eyes.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.421
I think it's my mother.

30:28.636 --> 30:30.511
I don't-- I don'T...

30:31.975 --> 30:33.499
r-recognize her...

30:33.851 --> 30:35.643
it's so long ago.

30:39.019 --> 30:42.206
She's saying words to me...

30:45.348 --> 30:47.856
I don't know them.

30:52.511 --> 30:55.077
Well, you can start with, what is this place?

30:55.241 --> 30:56.483
It's the shrine of talus.

30:56.484 --> 30:58.358
That means nothing to me.

30:58.359 --> 31:00.179
It's a planet of the ancestors. We brought you here.

31:00.180 --> 31:01.797
Thank you, Mr.Information.

31:01.798 --> 31:05.066
Since when did he become ronon the explainer, and why am I not in the infirmary, huh?

31:05.101 --> 31:06.449
What am I, better?

31:07.281 --> 31:08.687
I am better!

31:08.898 --> 31:10.000
No, you're not.

31:10.140 --> 31:12.051
I am. I can feel it. This is amazing!

31:12.133 --> 31:16.187
Mere, we brought you here so we could have a chance to say goodbye to each other,

31:16.996 --> 31:18.684
but you're only going to feel like this for about a day.

31:18.685 --> 31:20.933
- That's just how it works.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

31:22.668 --> 31:25.364
What do you remember?

31:25.598 --> 31:28.821
I remember you not wanting me to say goodbye then. Why now all of a sudden?

31:28.985 --> 31:30.672
Look, and why one day? What's with that?

31:30.816 --> 31:32.316
It is a gift of the shrine,

31:32.421 --> 31:35.292
and from all of us who risked great danger to bring you here,

31:35.398 --> 31:37.894
one last chance to be with those you love.

31:37.929 --> 31:39.851
And then what?

31:42.616 --> 31:43.624
I die?

31:43.859 --> 31:44.808
With honor.

31:44.831 --> 31:45.605
And dignity.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.409
Screw that, I'll just stay here.

31:47.410 --> 31:48.488
Doesn't work that way.

31:48.489 --> 31:49.425
Why not?

31:49.867 --> 31:52.117
One, this is a wraith-controlled planet.

31:52.482 --> 31:55.013
And we're detecting ionizing radiation.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.900
In fact, we shouldn't be standing this close to the--

31:56.901 --> 31:58.740
you've got to be kidding me.

31:59.255 --> 32:00.275
How could you let them do this to me?

32:00.276 --> 32:02.220
Don't blame her. She didn't even want to do this.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.329
Then whose brilliant idea was it?

32:04.529 --> 32:05.173
Mine.

32:05.174 --> 32:07.165
We all thought it was a good thing--

32:07.166 --> 32:09.544
how could this possibly be a good thing?

32:09.880 --> 32:12.575
Look, I'd got past the humiliation, I've said my goodbyes.

32:12.576 --> 32:16.489
Meredith, I'm sorry this happened to you, but I'm not sorry that I got this chance.

32:16.817 --> 32:19.466
Please, just... try to see this as an opportunity and not--

32:19.467 --> 32:21.001
not torture?

32:26.939 --> 32:29.060
Look, I'm sorry, I just...

32:30.034 --> 32:33.913
I thought I was going to be okay, and then now you tell me...

32:37.581 --> 32:39.608
did you have some kind of itinerary planned?

32:39.772 --> 32:42.585
Well, actually, we're going to have a big feast first.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.214
Last supper, huh?

32:44.331 --> 32:47.424
Well, suits your messiah complex.

32:48.303 --> 32:49.288
True.

32:51.186 --> 32:53.565
Please don't be mad at me.

32:54.719 --> 32:59.254
I guess if I had to choose the people I would spend my last day with, then...

33:03.040 --> 33:04.716
What is it?

33:06.415 --> 33:09.275
Honestly, I didn't expect it to work.

33:09.276 --> 33:12.111
I expected nothing would happen, and that would be that.

33:12.193 --> 33:15.193
So why did it?

33:16.939 --> 33:20.232
You don't believe in magic shrines any more than I do.

33:20.396 --> 33:22.189
Show him the readings.

33:29.476 --> 33:30.413
That's what I said.

33:30.414 --> 33:31.761
You said "hmm"?

33:31.890 --> 33:34.456
I just meant that I thought it was weird, too.

33:34.457 --> 33:35.745
So what do you think, antimatter?

33:35.746 --> 33:38.687
Or a superheavy element the ancients used to use as an energy source.

33:38.688 --> 33:39.742
I've never seen it before--

33:39.743 --> 33:41.886
or created to power whatever this place used to be.

33:41.887 --> 33:44.417
Who could tell what that is? Must be thousands of years--

33:44.523 --> 33:45.495
Whoa,

33:45.683 --> 33:48.097
- see that spike?
- Come on, this is your party. Let's have some fun.

33:48.098 --> 33:50.921
For me, this is fun. Just... save me some ham.

33:51.050 --> 33:52.140
Whoa, there it goes again.

33:52.175 --> 33:54.226
It's like some kind of intermittent gamma that's--

33:54.227 --> 33:56.183
- come with me.
- What? Why?

33:56.353 --> 33:57.900
Because I need to find out something.

33:57.901 --> 34:00.244
- Where are we going?
- Fuhoallly l the way back to atlantis.

34:06.982 --> 34:07.838
Sorry...

34:07.839 --> 34:09.619
why did you do that?

34:10.322 --> 34:14.377
To determine whether the parasite would expand rapidly back into his brain

34:14.378 --> 34:17.424
when we took him from the radiation source, and I think it did.

34:17.425 --> 34:23.083
The reashy w his symptoms disappeared when we came here was because it contracted to protect itself.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.652
All right, well, what does that mean for us?

34:25.652 --> 34:28.217
That leaving this chamber will probably kill him.

34:28.792 --> 34:31.089
We can't take him back to atlantis.

34:31.359 --> 34:32.389
So...

34:33.667 --> 34:37.101
we're going to have to find a way a way for me to operate on him right here.

34:51.588 --> 34:53.885
I thought you already tried radiation.

34:54.158 --> 34:57.217
Well, I did, but we'd never come across this kind before.

34:57.299 --> 34:59.220
The parasite is radiosensitive to it.

34:59.221 --> 35:00.826
That's why the shrine works.

35:00.955 --> 35:05.642
You feel fine for one day until the radiation starts making you feel sick, and you leave.

35:05.748 --> 35:08.783
The farther away you get, the more rapidly the parasite expands back into the brain.

35:08.841 --> 35:10.974
And your day is over. I get it.

35:11.256 --> 35:13.857
So, if we're here, it's small enough to operate?

35:13.881 --> 35:15.416
Well, I'm guessing here,

35:15.417 --> 35:18.029
but it's the only thing I can think of that would explain his sudden remission,

35:18.088 --> 35:20.502
but I'm not going to know for certain until I get in there.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.096
How are you going to manage that with a field kit?

35:22.097 --> 35:23.080
I don'T.

35:23.081 --> 35:24.908
We would have to bring equipment back from atlantis.

35:24.909 --> 35:26.338
Well, that's a problem.

35:27.011 --> 35:30.573
What if we radio atlantis, ask them to send a jumper through with what I need?

35:30.574 --> 35:31.305
No, we can'T.

35:31.306 --> 35:33.286
I need that equipment, john.

35:33.637 --> 35:36.110
the wraith are never going to fall for the same trick twice.

35:36.111 --> 35:38.184
Even if somehow they don't pick up on our radio signal,

35:38.219 --> 35:41.325
and even if the second jumper makes it through the gauntlet,

35:41.407 --> 35:43.481
they'll know we're here. We'll never make it back to atlantis.

35:43.482 --> 35:45.555
If we don't try, he's dead.

35:48.965 --> 35:49.891
What do you need?

35:49.892 --> 35:51.684
To operate? I already told you.

35:51.685 --> 35:55.176
No, bare minimum, what do you need?

35:55.563 --> 35:58.258
More than I have in my medical kit.

35:58.317 --> 36:01.364
I mean, I need a scanner to find out the location of the parasite,

36:01.469 --> 36:04.024
I need the proper tools to cut his skull open--

36:04.106 --> 36:05.688
all right.

36:06.813 --> 36:08.067
I've got A.Idea

36:08.068 --> 36:10.692
keep him as far away from this thg as he can stand.

36:10.774 --> 36:13.282
We'll be back in 20 minutes.

36:44.170 --> 36:46.291
You can't expect me to operate with those.

36:46.409 --> 36:48.213
Well, I've seen surgical drills.

36:48.214 --> 36:50.041
They're not that much different.

36:50.452 --> 36:54.987
F-fine, assuming we can open him up, I still have no way of knowing where the parasite has contracted to.

37:00.779 --> 37:02.244
We can use this.

37:02.245 --> 37:03.521
A lifesigns detector?

37:03.522 --> 37:04.495
Yeah. Why not?

37:04.671 --> 37:08.410
Well, it's just not designed to do what I need it to do on the correct scale.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.343
Oh, we'll have jeannie modify it.

37:11.035 --> 37:13.156
No. You don't understand.

37:13.234 --> 37:16.199
The radiation is compromising his immune system as we speak,

37:16.211 --> 37:17.957
which means if I don't kill him,

37:17.958 --> 37:22.070
the infection he's bound to get by being operated on in a damp cave almost certainly will!

37:22.140 --> 37:24.367
Look, if we don't do something, 

37:24.730 --> 37:26.043
he's dead.

37:26.523 --> 37:27.496
You said it.

37:27.671 --> 37:28.972
Absolutely not!

37:28.973 --> 37:30.718
We're talking about saving your life.

37:30.906 --> 37:34.234
Look, my brain is not some new deck off the back of your house.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.156
I'm not the one doing the surgery.

37:36.308 --> 37:38.113
S,ye and as my parting advice,

37:38.114 --> 37:40.937
you need to stop letting these guys talk you into doing stupid things.

37:40.961 --> 37:42.718
I can do it.

37:43.164 --> 37:43.820
Really?

37:43.914 --> 37:46.269
And I'm fairly sure I can modify the lifesigns detector.

37:46.304 --> 37:47.629
Yeah, with my help...

37:47.722 --> 37:48.589
so help.

37:48.590 --> 37:52.969
This isn't one of those pbs brain surgeries where my skull is wide open, and we're having a conversation...

37:52.970 --> 37:55.524
I have enough anesthetic to put you out. You're not going to feel a thing.

37:55.571 --> 37:57.340
Yeah, it's probably a hammer.

37:58.137 --> 37:59.696
Time is of the essence, rodney.

37:59.754 --> 38:00.985
You need to make a decision.

38:01.008 --> 38:02.860
Please, mere. Let us try.

38:03.035 --> 38:05.672
Look, obviously I'd get around to consenting. It's just--

38:05.762 --> 38:07.590
you've thrown an awful lot at me all at once.

38:07.649 --> 38:09.477
That's life.

38:10.110 --> 38:11.633
All right, well, let me have a little ham.

38:11.668 --> 38:12.629
No.

38:12.711 --> 38:14.867
No food before surgery.

38:18.638 --> 38:20.584
Bye, jeannie.

38:22.377 --> 38:24.533
Sorry I'm mean sometimes.

38:26.689 --> 38:28.447
Bye, teyla.

38:30.498 --> 38:32.420
Bye, ronon dex.

38:35.923 --> 38:37.658
Bye, john.

39:01.694 --> 39:04.952
I'm going to have to cut here...

39:05.761 --> 39:06.980
here...

39:08.058 --> 39:09.616
and here,

39:09.956 --> 39:12.054
and drill those points to resect the area.

39:12.148 --> 39:13.355
Okay.

39:14.140 --> 39:18.780
I don't want to penetrate the dura layers until we get to that stage, so hold him as still as you can.

39:20.842 --> 39:22.014
Go.

39:58.455 --> 40:01.455
I took too long reconfiguring the lifesigns detector.

40:01.526 --> 40:05.580
I haven't given her enough time to perform the surgery before his immune system is compromised.

40:09.225 --> 40:10.994
Dammit, I went too far. Hold him steady.

40:11.018 --> 40:12.213
I'm trying.

40:15.879 --> 40:17.848
It's the parasite... it's moving.

40:18.152 --> 40:20.402
Well, maybe it knows we're going after it.

40:21.223 --> 40:22.207
I don't think so.

40:22.208 --> 40:27.059
I think it instinctually wants to get away from the radiation source, and we've just shown it the way out.

40:35.185 --> 40:38.162
Ronon, we're going to need that gun of yours in about 10 seconds.

41:00.890 --> 41:02.859
You could have stepped on it.

41:03.058 --> 41:04.628
She told me to shoot it.

41:05.695 --> 41:07.148
It's clear.

41:09.825 --> 41:11.547
You did a good job.

41:12.098 --> 41:13.528
You too.

41:17.670 --> 41:19.767
Let's get him home.

41:33.530 --> 41:35.991
Why don't you go get some sleep? I'm going to be here all night.

41:36.085 --> 41:38.604
It's okay. I'd like to be here when he wakes up.

41:38.933 --> 41:40.772
Well, it could be a while.

41:41.229 --> 41:43.667
He does love to sleep, our rodney.

41:43.831 --> 41:45.636
You should've seen him when he was a teenager.

41:45.800 --> 41:48.026
Who can sleep with all the talking?

41:48.038 --> 41:49.526
Hi.

41:50.265 --> 41:51.671
Hi.

41:52.257 --> 41:55.515
You still, uh, all there?

41:57.929 --> 42:00.332
Well, there was so much to spare.

42:04.970 --> 42:06.470
Thank you.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.919
You're welcome.

42:09.306 --> 42:10.900
That was scary.

42:11.790 --> 42:13.114
For me too.

42:16.583 --> 42:18.212
Are you hungry?

42:19.982 --> 42:21.107
Peckish.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.646
I'll go order you something.

42:30.315 --> 42:31.522
Jennifer,

42:32.202 --> 42:33.854
there's something I wanted to...

42:36.292 --> 42:37.183
while I remember,

42:37.194 --> 42:40.663
while I still can, there's something I wanted to say before, uh...

42:41.226 --> 42:42.515
go ahead.

42:42.808 --> 42:44.085
I, uh...

42:47.073 --> 42:48.714
I love you.

42:50.515 --> 42:52.613
Loved you for some time now.

42:56.785 --> 42:58.472
Okay

42:59.176 --> 43:01.015
where was I...

43:01.262 --> 43:03.031
