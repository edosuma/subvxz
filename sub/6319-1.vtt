Tomas, you'll catch your death out here.
Come on.

14:08.881 --> 14:11.372
Is it himself then?

14:11.483 --> 14:12.973
Oh.

14:13.085 --> 14:16.816
I know he can be as warm and inviting
as that old King Fingal rock.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.390
But underneath it all,
there's a tender heart.

14:19.491 --> 14:22.619
You'll come to know that one day.

14:22.728 --> 14:26.061
I promise you. Now come on.

14:32.271 --> 14:35.604
I thought you'd like it.
It's himself's favorite.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.608
<i>Beef stew with red currant jelly.</i>

14:46.852 --> 14:49.980
[Clears Throat]

14:50.089 --> 14:52.887
Would you like more stew?

14:55.995 --> 14:58.088
Huh?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.055
What?

15:02.268 --> 15:04.964
Go on, lad. Eat your fill.

15:11.343 --> 15:12.970
Now drink this down.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.546
It's nice and warm,
and it'll help you sleep tonight.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.851
Here you are.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.852
Does the nightshirt fit all right?

15:25.357 --> 15:26.881
In you go.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.232
I'll leave a wee light on for you.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.572
Good night.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.857
Not a talker, is he?

16:03.963 --> 16:07.990
Wasn't it your father who taught you,
"Wise men think; fools talk"?

16:10.736 --> 16:13.136
- Aye.
- <i>Give him time, Alec.</i>

16:13.238 --> 16:15.706
<i>Everything here is so strange to him.</i>

16:15.808 --> 16:18.606
What were you doing out there
in the rain?

16:18.711 --> 16:20.611
You got soaked to the bone.

16:20.713 --> 16:24.171
That poor boy has never
been allowed to play in the rain.

16:32.091 --> 16:34.992
You're disappointed, aren't you?

16:35.094 --> 16:38.222
- I agreed to it.
- Aye.

16:38.330 --> 16:42.096
But now that you've seen him,
you're disappointed.

16:42.201 --> 16:47.036
I'll not deny I expected you to choose a boy
that had the making of a man in him.

16:47.139 --> 16:50.108
I don't see why you chose
the runt of the litter.

16:50.209 --> 16:53.406
<i>It'll be a wonder if the first gale of wind</i>
<i>doesn't carry him away.</i>

16:53.512 --> 16:55.844
- Surely there was a heartier boy.
- <i>Aye.</i>

16:57.216 --> 16:59.650
But it was Tomas I chose.

17:04.156 --> 17:07.557
What if he finds life too hard on Corrie
and breaks your heart...

17:07.659 --> 17:10.787
<i>and fills you with more grief?</i>

17:10.896 --> 17:13.057
<i>It's you I'm thinking of.</i>

17:13.165 --> 17:15.690
- Don't you be worrying about me, Alec.
- How can I not?

17:18.971 --> 17:20.871
<i>I'm feeling the cold</i>
<i>something fierce tonight.</i>

17:20.973 --> 17:23.635

Well, why don't you put on your boots
and have a good look.

<i>for splashing in puddles?</i>

18:47.392 --> 18:49.155
[Barks]

18:52.064 --> 18:55.864
You didn't tell me you picked a lad
who can't even speak.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.129
You didn't ask, did you?

18:58.237 --> 19:01.673
All these months I've been over to the home
and you never once asked me about him.

19:01.773 --> 19:04.003
I trusted your judgment, didn't I?

19:07.012 --> 19:09.071
<i>[Maire]</i>
<i>You of all people should be sympathetic.</i>

19:09.181 --> 19:12.048
He may have trouble
saying certain words...

but some people have trouble
using them at all.

<i>[Maire]</i>
<i>Tomas?</i>

20:15.214 --> 20:17.546
<i>Tomas?</i>

20:17.649 --> 20:21.517
Since you're going out anyway,
you might like to take him.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.384
Well, he's not about, is he?

20:25.824 --> 20:28.554
<i>No, he's not.</i>

20:28.660 --> 20:31.185
So be on your way then.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.611
Hmm.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.147
The sun is wild high up there.

<i>And we never come down here at night</i>
<i>when they're all flying.</i>

38:32.209 --> 38:34.871
- Me and Rory would.
- Would not.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.947
Rory's afraid of everything.

38:40.518 --> 38:43.487
She's a a beauty.

38:44.588 --> 38:46.488
No matter how heavy the seas...

38:46.590 --> 38:48.717
she's safe and sound in here.

38:48.826 --> 38:51.192
Are we taking her out?

38:51.295 --> 38:54.822

you'd know the tide's against us.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.520

- <i>[Alec] Aye.</i>

39:21.625 --> 39:23.786
Fresh air and your cooking.

39:23.894 --> 39:26.454
And have you noticed
that he calls me "Mum"?

39:27.498 --> 39:31.696
- I had.
- <i>Come on, Ben. Come on.</i>

39:31.802 --> 39:33.895
- What does he call me, I wonder?
- <i>Ooh.</i>

39:34.004 --> 39:35.471
Just "himself."

39:35.573 --> 39:39.202
I think he knows that
you wouldn't want him to call you Alec.

39:40.745 --> 39:42.406
Good enough.

39:44.949 --> 39:46.940
[Sighs]
You hardly talk to him.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.918
[Groans]
I try.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.113
He hardly says a word.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.123
You have to show him you want him.

39:54.225 --> 39:58.491
I feed him, put clothes on his back,
share me house with him.

40:00.030 --> 40:02.430
I can't have my own feelings for him
the way you do.

40:02.533 --> 40:04.091
But don't you see, Alec?

40:04.201 --> 40:07.830
I need you to share more things with him.
Not just a house.

- Give me your paw.

40:14.111 --> 40:17.171
- <i>Ben's a good boy.</i>
- I know you wished for our own child.

40:19.216 --> 40:24.654
But have you considered
that maybe Tomas is a gift to us?

40:38.435 --> 40:40.335
Good boy. That's it.

40:42.673 --> 40:44.834
I'm taking a trip
to the mainland tomorrow.

- Are you sure that's wise?
- Oh, it's pure wisdom.

It's to be a fine day
and smooth sailing.

40:56.554 --> 40:58.988
and it has Tomas's name on it.

40:59.089 --> 41:01.683
And next to it, it says March the 3rd.

41:03.327 --> 41:08.196
March the 3rd?
That's my b b birthday.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.967
Wouldn't you know it?

41:11.068 --> 41:12.535
And today is March the 1 st.

41:12.636 --> 41:15.935
So you see,
I absolutely must take the trip.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.874
<i>Now, Alec...</i>

41:18.976 --> 41:23.811
did you not say you were going to be
checking the crab traps tomorrow?

41:25.115 --> 41:27.015
Aye, I said it.

41:27.117 --> 41:29.585
<i>And you were thinking-</i>

That, um, you and I could go.

- Mmm.
- <i>[Maire Laughs] That's settled then.</i>

- Aye.

<i>It's not uncommon for the mothers</i>

42:27.578 --> 42:30.513
and leave the wee ones on the shore.

42:30.614 --> 42:33.139
Sometimes they don't come back.

42:35.819 --> 42:38.151
But he might starve.

42:38.255 --> 42:39.722
He might.

42:48.732 --> 42:51.326
- We could feed him.
- [Scoffs]

42:51.435 --> 42:54.598
Today. What about tomorrow?

42:54.705 --> 42:58.641
A pup might need carin' for
for weeks, maybe longer.

43:02.279 --> 43:04.338
I'll do it.

43:07.384 --> 43:09.375
- You think you're up to it?
- I am.

Get us a couple of wee fish.

44:10.347 --> 44:12.247
<i>Now, you see here, the secret is...</i>

44:12.349 --> 44:15.785
to brown the meat until it's really crisp.

44:15.886 --> 44:19.219
Only then do you add
the vegetables and the water.

45:18.949 --> 45:20.849
Lucky you never ate at the home.

45:20.951 --> 45:25.820
The food tasted like mud.
Really, it did.

45:28.125 --> 45:31.617
My mum's the best cook.

45:31.728 --> 45:35.164
You should try her stew.
You'd love it.

45:36.266 --> 45:38.461
But you like your fish raw, don't you?

45:40.938 --> 45:42.064
You know...

45:43.740 --> 45:45.640
I'm going to call you Smudge.

<i>Well, Tomas, I think you and I

a reason for celebrating.

- They don't celebrate birthdays?
- <i>No.</i>

46:14.071 --> 46:18.872
They consider them a feckless waste
of time and money, if you can believe it.

46:18.976 --> 46:21.410
Are you feeding that seal of yours?

46:21.512 --> 46:23.673
I gave him the last of the fish.
