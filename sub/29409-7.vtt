<i>Amy: Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:04.921 --> 00:07.590
- Congratulations, Georgie.

00:07.632 --> 00:09.968
- Quinn! What're you doing here?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.469
- I've always enjoyed doing
business with you,

00:11.511 --> 00:13.179
so maybe we should talk about

00:13.221 --> 00:14.639
getting your new product
in my stores.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.599
- Wow, that, that'd be great.

00:16.641 --> 00:18.560
- He didn't waste any time.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.395
- Could you not leave your
toothbrush out on the sink?

00:20.437 --> 00:23.356
It's disgusting.
- Hey, you.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.358
You have been so rude
to Luke since we got home.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.527
What's going on?
- He got Georgie's room.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.279
- You are an incredible jumper,

00:29.320 --> 00:31.281
and you are an incredible
person.

00:31.322 --> 00:33.783
That's why I'm here.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.411
- Then you've wasted your time.
- All right.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.753

01:50.652 --> 01:51.653
- Ho...

01:53.029 --> 01:55.031
Okay, boy, you ready
for your big finale?

01:55.073 --> 01:56.491
(Spartan nickers)
Up!

01:59.619 --> 02:01.162
(Spartan nickers)

02:02.080 --> 02:04.666
(Sighs) Come on, boy.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.836
(Sighs) Spartan.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.466
(Low growl)
- Whoa, boy, whoa.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.509
Steady...

02:16.970 --> 02:19.681
Canvas, come on.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.016
(Low growl)

02:21.057 --> 02:23.435
Canvas! Come on, let's go!

02:23.476 --> 02:25.562
Whoa! Agh! Ungh!

02:45.665 --> 02:47.959
* And at the break of day *

02:48.001 --> 02:50.879
* You sank into your dream *

02:52.756 --> 02:54.007
* You dreamer *

02:54.049 --> 02:56.760
* Oh, oh, oh, oh... *

02:56.801 --> 02:58.219
* You dreamer... *

03:01.056 --> 03:04.726
* You dreamer *

03:10.774 --> 03:14.069
- (Chuckles) Hey, boy,
you're okay.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.446
We all have our off days.
Come on.

03:16.488 --> 03:19.407
(Clucks her tongue,
phone buzzes)

03:20.492 --> 03:22.243
Scott, hey!

03:23.912 --> 03:26.414
Um, this weekend? I don't know.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.585
Yeah. Who's the client?

03:32.087 --> 03:33.463
(Excited chuckle)

03:33.505 --> 03:36.049
Yeah, when Scott said her name,
I honestly got shivers.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.718
- Yeah, imagine that,
Jane Morrison.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.012
- Yeah.
- What am I missing?

03:41.054 --> 03:43.515
Who's this woman?
- Uh, Jane is Scott's client.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.266
She's the artist.
- Who?

03:45.308 --> 03:47.936
- The one that Ty and Scott
were visiting when they got...

03:47.977 --> 03:50.438
- Her?!
- ...in the plane crash.
- No way!

03:50.480 --> 03:52.232
No, you're getting
in a busted-up bush plane--

03:52.273 --> 03:54.943
- Dad, it's okay.
Jane's having an art retreat

03:54.984 --> 03:56.903
just outside of town
this weekend,

03:56.945 --> 03:58.780
and she's asked me to come
and work with her horse.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.157
And I get to stay for free
in one of the cabins

04:01.199 --> 04:02.867
she's booked for the event.
- Wow!

04:02.909 --> 04:04.953
That sounds kind of amazing.
- I know!

04:04.994 --> 04:06.663
And it's kind of perfect
timing too,

04:06.705 --> 04:09.040
since Lyndy and Ty
are visiting Ty's mom.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.126
- Hey, Tim, we gotta go.
We can't be late for Garland.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.586
- Yeah, right.
We gotta get to Garland

04:13.628 --> 04:16.589
before that traitor Mitch
becomes his new poster boy.

04:16.630 --> 04:20.051
- Good morning, Dad.
- For some maybe.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.512
- You know what,
I am so over this fight.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.556
- Agreed. Well, I better get
to work.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.599
We'll see you guys in a bit.
- Bye.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.227
- Oh, I should too. Uh...

04:29.269 --> 04:31.021
Quinn's horse goes out today
and then I've got that

04:31.062 --> 04:33.064
cross-country event. Can--
(Phone rings) Oh, and...

04:33.106 --> 04:34.774
- Yes, I got it.
- This thing won't stop going.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.943
Hello? Yes, I'm coming.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.154
I'm coming.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.740
- Luke just used up all
the maple syrup!

04:41.781 --> 04:42.991
- No, I didn't!

04:45.285 --> 04:47.245
There was barely
any left anyways.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.664
- Sharing. It's a thing.
Look it up.

04:49.706 --> 04:50.999
(Hard thunk)

04:51.041 --> 04:53.752
- What is with this family
and arguing?

04:53.793 --> 04:56.629
It's an epidemic.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.716
But you know what? I can cure
you two of it at least.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.343
Just you watch.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.181
- No, no. I...
look, you know what?

05:06.222 --> 05:08.433
I'm gonna have to call you back
about this, all right?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.602
Yes, soon. I will. Thank you.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.022
All right. Well, everything
looks in order.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.149
Let's get this boy to Florida,
shall we?

05:16.191 --> 05:17.609
<i>- And our fillies can't wait</i>
<i>to meet him.</i>

05:17.650 --> 05:19.194
- Oh!
- Just thought I would come

05:19.235 --> 05:21.780
and, you know,
see this stud off.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.991
- How nice. (Phone rings)
Oh, sorry.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.369
Excuse me, please. Yes?

05:29.037 --> 05:29.954
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

05:29.996 --> 05:31.915
- Hey.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.084
- Ouch. Really?
Is that all I get?

05:34.125 --> 05:37.045
<i>Lisa: Okay, thank you.</i>

05:37.087 --> 05:38.588
<i>More issues with this</i>
<i>cross-country race.</i>

05:38.630 --> 05:40.674
I swear it is cursed!

05:40.715 --> 05:43.259
- You know, I can deal
with this if you want.

05:43.301 --> 05:46.012
- Really? I mean, I, I have
reviewed all the paperwork,

05:46.054 --> 05:47.597
so you'd just need to be
my eyes at the airport.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.849
Would you be comfortable
with that?

05:49.891 --> 05:52.227
- Yeah, totally.
- I can do it! No problem.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.562
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.150
- Look at you, boss lady.
- Stop.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.276
This is the first time
Lisa's given me

06:00.318 --> 06:01.945
any actual responsibility,
okay?

06:01.986 --> 06:03.822
I need to focus.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.740
- Are you suggesting
I'm a distraction?

06:10.078 --> 06:11.663
(Sighs)

06:13.289 --> 06:16.918
- I miss you guys.
- We miss you, too.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.712
But it's pretty great that
you get to meet Jane.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.631
- I know. I can't wait to put
a face to that painting.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.967
- Yeah, it's pretty special.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.677
You know, bringing that
painting home to you

06:25.719 --> 06:28.888
is one of the things that
kept me going after the crash.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.266
I always felt like I should pay
Jane back for that somehow.

06:31.307 --> 06:33.101
Now you're going to.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.228
- Well, hopefully.
- You will.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.022
And I'm glad you finally get
to take some time away.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.523
When's the last time
you did that?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.191
- Our camping trip...

06:40.233 --> 06:42.193
and Mongolia.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.821
- (Laughs) Well, then you're
definitely due for a vacation.

06:44.863 --> 06:45.947
- (Laughing)

06:50.994 --> 06:52.787
- All right, well,
thanks for the ride.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.040
- Hey, wait. Can...

06:55.081 --> 06:56.583
can we just cut the company
manners for a second?

06:58.126 --> 06:59.919
- Quinn, right?

06:59.961 --> 07:01.463
- Uh, yes, sir.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.177
- Just wanted to, uh,
properly introduce myself.

07:07.218 --> 07:10.722
I'm Tim Fleming.
I'm Georgie's grandfather.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.223
- Well, it's great to meet you,
Mr. Fleming.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.017
- So, you're the guy.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.185
(Chuckles) Interesting.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.228
Listen, we're just about
to eat dinner,

07:17.270 --> 07:19.356
so why don't you join us,

07:19.397 --> 07:21.399
give us a chance to get
to know you a little better.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.401
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
Quinn's-Quinn's busy.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.071
He's got um...
- You know what? I'd love to.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.822
- He'd love to!

07:27.864 --> 07:29.407
- (Sighs)
- Great.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.326
So park over there
and we'll see you inside.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.495
<i>This'll be fun.</i>

07:36.414 --> 07:38.249
- So, I've decided I'm gonna
take Spartan

07:38.291 --> 07:40.126
with me to the retreat,

07:40.168 --> 07:41.795
and then that way I can go
on some trail rides

07:41.836 --> 07:43.338
while Jane is teaching
her art classes.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.839
- Well, I'm glad you're going
because every mom

07:44.881 --> 07:46.341
deserves some "me time."

07:46.383 --> 07:47.842
- Sounds like you're taking
a little "me time"

07:47.884 --> 07:49.719
yourself there, Quinn.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.013
But why you'd choose Hudson
for your vacation...

07:52.055 --> 07:53.431
(Chuckles)

07:53.473 --> 07:55.100
- Why not?
- Someone like you?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.477
With a famous family,
lots of money to burn?

07:57.519 --> 07:59.187
Your dad was an Olympic
show jumper, right?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.064
- Yes, my dad was.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.524
- Yeah, I know,
I did my research.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.317
<i>- Well, then I'm sure you also</i>
<i>know that my time here</i>

08:04.359 --> 08:06.236
<i>hasn't just been vacation.</i>

08:06.277 --> 08:07.987
Thanks to Lisa,
I found a stud horse

08:08.029 --> 08:09.406
for my family's equestrian
facility in Well--

08:09.447 --> 08:11.157
- In Wellington, Florida.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.742
Almost as big as
Spruce Meadows.

08:12.784 --> 08:13.952
- Well, I don't know
about that.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.204
- It is. I know. I read
the articles.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.456
So, you got your horse,
now what're gonna do?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.875
- Quinn, why don't you tell us
a little bit

08:20.917 --> 08:22.419
about how you and Georgie met
at the,

08:22.460 --> 08:24.254
uh, training program.
- Oh, Mom,

08:24.295 --> 08:26.089
no-nobody wants to know.
- Come on.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.091
- Well, it's a pretty short
story, actually.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.218
<i>I saw Georgie jump</i>
<i>on her first day and...</i>

08:30.260 --> 08:32.429
I'd never seen anything
quite like it.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.140
I decided that I just had
to know her.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.433
- When did you say you were
leaving again?

08:36.474 --> 08:39.769
- I didn't. And I'm actually
not sure.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.062
I'm just waiting on a...

08:43.023 --> 08:45.775
couple of things to hopefully
come together.

08:45.817 --> 08:49.529
- Well, you're welcome anytime
here, Quinn.

08:49.571 --> 08:53.158
That is, unless those things
you just mentioned

08:53.199 --> 08:55.702
come too close together.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.042
- So... dinner was really great.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.837
- That was not dinner.
That was... the gauntlet.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.214
Both: (Laugh)

09:08.256 --> 09:11.176
- Hey, it's still pretty early.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.011
Can you spare an hour or two?

09:13.053 --> 09:16.931
If I passed my Heartland
initiation, that is.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.475
- You know what?
You held your own.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.102
I'm actually pretty impressed.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.271
- I aim to please.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.857
Let's get Phoenix trailered up.
I got an idea.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.864
- Hi.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.491
- Yeah? What do you got there?

09:34.532 --> 09:37.202
- This is an article on that
artist Jane and her retreat,

09:37.243 --> 09:39.287
and it sounds amazing.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.748
You don't have to know anything
about art. It's for beginners.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.833
And I wanna go.
Tomorrow, with you.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.835
- (Groans) Are you kidding me?

09:45.877 --> 09:47.379
<i>- No, I'm not kidding.</i>

09:47.420 --> 09:49.506
I'm burnt out,
and we need a break.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.050
And I know you do
because of this Mitch business.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.593
And it, and it just sounds
terrific,

09:53.635 --> 09:55.387
and I know the food
will be delicious.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.098
- I'm sorry, Lise,
but that's just not me.

09:58.139 --> 10:02.268
- I called and they have
one little cottage left,

10:02.310 --> 10:05.313
and they have amazing fishing
right nearby.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.525
<i>So I could paint, you can fish,</i>

10:08.566 --> 10:11.403
and then we could have our
nights alone together

10:11.444 --> 10:13.446
in this cute little cottage,
and I will bring

10:13.488 --> 10:16.241
some of the wine that you love
from Tuscany.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.993
- Doesn't sound too terrible.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.454
I guess I could suffer
through a little fishing.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.873
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, count me in.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.959
- Consider it booked.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.378
- It already is, isn't it?
- Yes, it is, yes. Yes, it is.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.963
- (Chuckles)

10:31.256 --> 10:32.424
- Are we really doing this?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.968
- Oh, come on.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.845
How can you look at Lisa's
brand new cross-country course

10:36.886 --> 10:38.388
and not wanna jump it?

10:38.430 --> 10:40.432
Besides, I've been wondering

10:40.473 --> 10:42.934
where that girl I knew
in Europe got to.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.853
My guess is I'll find her
out there.

10:44.894 --> 10:54.904
**

10:54.946 --> 11:04.914
**

11:04.956 --> 11:07.375
**

11:07.417 --> 11:09.044
- (Breathing hard)

11:10.879 --> 11:13.256
Good boy.
- You know what?

11:13.298 --> 11:15.133
I definitely missed that.
- What?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.968
- That smile.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.387
The one you always get
after clearing a jump.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.348
- Okay, I guess I have missed
jumping

11:21.389 --> 11:23.266
a lot more than I thought,
okay?

11:23.308 --> 11:25.852
And he has too, huh, boy?

11:25.894 --> 11:27.228
- Then why'd you give it up?

11:29.481 --> 11:32.901
You're too good just
to walk away like that.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.322
- (Sighs) Okay, maybe I don't
wanna quit jumping completely,

11:37.364 --> 11:39.449
but...

11:39.491 --> 11:41.159
I don't wanna put a lot of
pressure on myself right now.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.244
I just wanna have fun
this summer.

11:43.286 --> 11:46.831
I don't wanna take anything
too seriously.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.042
- Including me?

11:49.084 --> 11:52.629
Okay. I mean, I'll take
what I can get here.

11:52.671 --> 11:55.799
If that's what you want,
works for me.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.635
- So you're cool if we just...
roll with things for a while?

11:58.677 --> 12:00.261
Try not to define anything?

12:04.683 --> 12:06.393
- What do you think?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.942
(Music swells)

12:18.113 --> 12:19.948
(Birds chirp, creek flows)

12:21.491 --> 12:23.618
- Isn't this place gorgeous?

12:23.660 --> 12:26.871
- Perfect. This was such
a good idea! (Laughing)

12:26.913 --> 12:28.915
- Amy?
- Jane.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.291
- Thank you so much for coming.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.502
- It's my pleasure. Honestly.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.170
This is my grandpa.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.089
- Jack. Yes, hello.
- Hi there.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.216
- And you must be Lisa.
- I am. Hi.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.552
- Welcome. I have a few more
guests to greet,

12:40.593 --> 12:42.220
then you and I can get down
to work.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.638
- Absolutely.
- I'm so looking forward to it.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.598
Please, make yourselves
at home.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.600
- Thank you.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.810
- So? Happy?

12:50.353 --> 12:52.939
- I can feel the stress
melting away already.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.816
<i>Caleb: No! Seriously?!</i>

12:56.192 --> 12:58.695
What're the odds?
- Caleb.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.655
I don't believe it.
- What're you guys doing here?

13:00.697 --> 13:02.782
- Well, I'm a huge fan
of Jane's work,

13:02.824 --> 13:05.452
and when I heard about her
workshop, I thought...

13:05.493 --> 13:07.370
it'd be a fun thing for Caleb
and I to do together.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.373
- Yup. You ready to make
some terrible art?

13:10.415 --> 13:11.624
- You have at 'er.
I'll be fishing.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.044
- Fishing!

13:14.085 --> 13:16.004
Sign me up!

13:16.046 --> 13:17.464
You brought an extra rod,
right?

13:22.427 --> 13:24.763
- Hey, there's a show jumping
competition tomorrow

13:24.804 --> 13:26.723
and I think that
you should enter.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.851
- Tiny local thing.
Super easy, zero competition.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.813
Besides, it'd get you back
in that proverbial saddle.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.565
- Did it look like I needed
help yesterday?

13:35.607 --> 13:36.983
- Definitely not.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.364
- Okay, I'm in.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.449
(Chuckles)

13:44.491 --> 13:48.286
- Today, we are gonna be
painting our feelings,

13:48.328 --> 13:50.080
so that we can show,
and not tell,

13:50.121 --> 13:51.498
them to each other.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.875
Katie, why don't you start
and, um,

13:53.917 --> 13:56.336
pick a colour that you
feel represents your mood.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.632
Black? That--

14:00.674 --> 14:04.386
No, you know what?
That's valid. Very valid.

14:04.427 --> 14:07.180
(Clears throat)
Luke, what do you pick?

14:07.222 --> 14:09.432
- I guess, blue?
- Okay, great.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.101
Why?

14:11.142 --> 14:13.061
- I dunno.
Cuz it's my favourite?

14:13.103 --> 14:15.146
- 'Kay.
- That's not what this is about.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.607
Didn't you listen?
You can't feel blue.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.734
- Uh, yes, I can.
It's like a saying.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.653
- Whatever,
you know what I mean.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.738
- You know what? Why don't we
just put some of these feelings

14:23.780 --> 14:25.365
down on the paper.
- At least I picked

14:25.407 --> 14:27.534
an actual colour.
- Black's a colour!

14:27.575 --> 14:29.494
- It's a shade!
Ask my art teacher.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.579
- Okay, everyone pick up
a paintbrush.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.165
Thank you.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.500
- (Sighs heavily)
- Black's a colour.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.295
(Hooves thud, Phoenix grunts)

14:39.337 --> 14:41.381
(Rail thuds)

14:41.423 --> 14:44.092
- Ooh! Yikes!
I am out of practice.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.802
I've completely lost my eye.

14:45.844 --> 14:49.139
- You gotta give it more
than five minutes.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.433
- Hey, guys!

14:51.474 --> 14:53.560
- Hey!
- What's going on here?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.520
- Georgie's agreed to jump in
a show tomorrow.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.605
- What?! Really?!
That's... wow!

14:59.774 --> 15:01.693
- No, it's really not
that big a deal.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.695
It's just a local thing.
- Not that big a deal.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.363
This is your first time jumping
since coming home!

15:05.405 --> 15:07.198
This is huge!

15:07.240 --> 15:09.200
<i>We're all gonna be there,</i>
<i>right guys?</i>

15:09.242 --> 15:10.827
What could be better
than rallying together

15:10.869 --> 15:12.954
for Georgie's big comeback,
right?

15:16.624 --> 15:18.960
- Thankfully, I got away
with just a few bruises,

15:19.002 --> 15:22.839
but Canvas... I think that
cougar traumatized him.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.758
He's become so unpredictable
and edgy.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.260
I hope you can work your magic,
Amy.

15:27.302 --> 15:30.805
- Hmm. Well, he seems like
a really great horse.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.350
Confident and steady.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.769
I'd love to see you ride him.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.145
- Okay.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.359
- Honestly, I don't see
a problem.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.319
You two work perfectly together.

15:44.361 --> 15:47.405
You're in sync, he's calm.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.408
- Well, this area's predictable.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.369
There's nothing here
to spook him.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.621
When we're on the trails,
it's a different story.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.623
- Okay. Well, let's go
for a trail ride

15:56.664 --> 15:57.749
and then I can see what
you mean.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.501
- No, I can't.

15:59.542 --> 16:03.463
I mean... I'd like to,
but my class starts soon.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.548
Feel free to take Canvas
out yourself.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.592
I'm sure you'll see how
erratic he's been acting.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.094
- Yeah, okay.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.097
(River flows)

16:15.392 --> 16:16.601
<i>Caleb: Finally!</i>

16:16.643 --> 16:18.228
There you are!

16:18.269 --> 16:19.688
- Caleb, you found me.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.775
There's a rod right there.
Help yourself.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.026
- Oh.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.696
Uh... 'kay.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.658
(Humming tunelessly)

16:32.951 --> 16:34.411
- Is there a problem?

16:34.452 --> 16:37.205
- No, no problem. Just...

16:37.247 --> 16:39.290
it's been a little while
since I fished.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.793
- Great.
(Rod whooshes)

16:41.835 --> 16:43.670
(Line unwinds)

16:46.589 --> 16:48.174
<i>(Annoyed growl)</i>

16:48.216 --> 16:49.843
- All right.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.679
Grab the rod...

16:52.721 --> 16:54.514
<i>Uh, oops!</i>

16:58.435 --> 17:00.937
- You know, Caleb, I'm thinking
you might be better off

17:00.979 --> 17:02.814
doing the painting thing.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.316
- No. No way.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.818
- I don't get it, then.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.695
Why did you even agree
to go on this trip?

17:09.738 --> 17:11.865
- Cass and I have tried to
focus less on the baby stuff

17:11.906 --> 17:15.201
and more on just spending time
together, but...

17:15.242 --> 17:17.912
lately it's been an awful lot
of time.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.540
It seems like there's a plan
every weekend and...

17:20.582 --> 17:22.334
I sorta go along with it.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.919
- I see.
- Gotta admit,

17:24.961 --> 17:27.297
<i>it's nice to have</i>
<i>a little guy time.</i>

17:27.339 --> 17:29.090
Does that make me a terrible
husband?

17:32.552 --> 17:35.555
- Nope. Just a terrible
fisherman.

17:35.597 --> 17:36.723
- (Sighs heavily)

17:39.809 --> 17:41.978
- Painting is about feeling.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.230
About capturing motion
and emotion.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.525
So, during this workshop,

17:47.567 --> 17:51.738
I'd like you to focus less
on what you see

17:51.780 --> 17:54.783
and more on how what you see
makes you feel.

17:56.368 --> 17:58.787
So, let's dive right in.

18:05.627 --> 18:08.380
- Uh, actually, let's talk
about composition.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.465
(Phone rings)
- Oh, sorry.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.969
Oh, shoot. Excuse me.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.763
This better be good.

18:18.390 --> 18:21.226
(Hooves thud heavily,
rail thunks)

18:23.353 --> 18:25.563
- I am officially
in panic mode.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.899
We are completely out of
practice and out of sync.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.609
I'm not ready for the horse
show tomorrow.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.403
- I actually have a few
pointers.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.946
- I don't know how I feel about
you playing coach.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.156
- Agreed! So...

18:35.198 --> 18:36.741
how about I just make
some casual suggestions

18:36.783 --> 18:38.952
you can take or leave?

18:38.993 --> 18:40.537
- (Sighs) Okay.

18:40.578 --> 18:43.164
(Phoenix grunts,
Georgie clucks her tongue)

18:44.958 --> 18:46.876
- All right, hey, try to open
up your stride a little bit.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.336
That'll, that'll loosen
things up.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.171
(Hooves thud)

18:51.881 --> 18:53.591
(Rail thunks)

18:53.633 --> 18:54.843
Or not.

18:57.679 --> 19:00.849
- I'm sorry, it's just not how
I was trained.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.018
And when I'm this rusty,
I need to stick to what I know.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.728
- Come on, where's that
confidence I saw

19:04.769 --> 19:06.062
on the cross-country course?

19:06.104 --> 19:07.605
- I think I left that
in Europe.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.691
- No, I'm not buying it.

19:09.733 --> 19:12.819
Okay, just trust me.
Take a risk.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.697
You could be Olympic level.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.033
I do not say that
about a lot of riders,

19:18.074 --> 19:19.576
including myself.
(Phone rings)

19:19.617 --> 19:22.495
- That's mine.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.372
- It's Lisa.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.711
- Hello?

19:29.753 --> 19:31.588
What?

19:31.629 --> 19:33.465
No, that's not possible.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.176
Yeah, I did, I did everything
you told me to.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.054
Okay, I will head to Fairfield
right away then.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.847
Okay. Bye.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.643
Your stud horse is missing
in transit

19:45.685 --> 19:47.687
and apparently it's my fault.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.651
<i>Quinn: No, the flight left</i>
<i>yesterday morning.</i>

19:55.528 --> 19:57.197
I understand that you
weren't on duty, sir, but--

19:59.032 --> 20:01.242
No. That's fine,
I'll call back.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.581
- I am in so much trouble.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.919
- Hey, we'll find the horse,
all right?

20:10.960 --> 20:14.506
I mean, he's gotta be somewhere.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.883
Unless he flew over the Bermuda
Triangle or something,

20:16.925 --> 20:19.594
then yeah, we're totally
screwed.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.061
- What you said...

20:28.103 --> 20:30.230
earlier about not being
Olympic level.

20:31.856 --> 20:33.608
Do you really believe that?

20:35.527 --> 20:37.529
- Uh...

20:37.570 --> 20:38.863
my dad -

20:40.740 --> 20:43.159
he's a champion,

20:43.201 --> 20:46.371
uh, and he knows
what it takes to win -

20:46.413 --> 20:47.622
doesn't think I have it.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.543
Yeah, he's probably right.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.044
- But you're good, Quinn.
- Correct.

20:53.086 --> 20:56.881
Good. Not great.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.926
<i>My dad didn't think I made</i>
<i>enough progress in Europe so...</i>

20:59.968 --> 21:02.762
that program was kind of
my last shot.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.682
Now, he wants me
to give it all up,

21:05.724 --> 21:09.185
join the family business
and rah, rah, rah.

21:09.227 --> 21:12.689
- You can't just quit jumping.
- I don't want to.

21:12.731 --> 21:15.025
But unless I'm bringing home
the gold anytime soon,

21:15.066 --> 21:16.901
that's that.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.029
<i>And that's why it's so hard</i>
<i>for me to just...</i>

21:19.070 --> 21:21.865
watch you choose to walk away.

21:21.906 --> 21:24.993
Because I know that I'm never
gonna be "it".

21:26.578 --> 21:28.747
But I see it in you.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.874
You've got a real gift, Georgie,

21:30.915 --> 21:32.042
and that's a gift that
no amount of money

21:32.083 --> 21:33.668
can actually ever buy and...

21:36.212 --> 21:37.756
and I love that about you.

21:42.093 --> 21:44.012
- So... what are you gonna do?

21:44.054 --> 21:46.222
- I dunno.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.183
Keep jumping as much as I can.

21:48.224 --> 21:51.311
Do odd jobs for my family
and keep my dad happy.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.688
Hopefully that'll be enough
to keep me off his radar.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.736
- Hey.

21:59.778 --> 22:01.363
This is it. I got it.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.701
This is only a flight
to Toronto.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.915
There's no connecting flight
to Florida.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.917
- Look who signed off on it.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.502
<i>Lisa Stillman.</i>

22:17.671 --> 22:20.423
- What?! The horse is where?!

22:20.465 --> 22:22.926
How?!

22:22.967 --> 22:25.053
My signat--?!

22:29.557 --> 22:31.685
Um, okay.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.019
Thank you for telling me.

22:33.061 --> 22:36.731
I'm sorry to put all this
on you.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.858
Okay, honey. I-I-I really
appreciate you handling this.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.779
- It's okay.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.699
We'll take it nice and easy.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.784
You're a good boy, Canvas.

22:47.826 --> 22:49.911
Yeah.
(Canvas nickers)

22:49.953 --> 22:51.121
(Clucks her tongue,
sharp growl)

22:51.162 --> 22:52.580
(Amy gasps)

22:52.622 --> 22:54.833
(Growling)

22:56.251 --> 22:57.752
(Shallow breaths)

22:58.962 --> 23:01.715
It's okay.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.758
<i>(Mountain lion growls)</i>

23:11.307 --> 23:13.977
You're a good boy.
(Canvas nickers)

23:14.019 --> 23:15.603
You're okay.

23:17.605 --> 23:20.400
- So, I've done a little
research

23:20.442 --> 23:24.279
and I found this awesome
exercise called a "trust walk".

23:24.320 --> 23:26.114
Luke, you're gonna be
blindfolded

23:26.156 --> 23:28.658
and Katie is gonna act
as "guide", okay?

23:28.700 --> 23:29.868
But there's a trick.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.038
You can't guide by touch.
Only by words.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.915
So this is an exercise in trust

23:35.957 --> 23:38.335
and in working as a team, okay?

23:38.376 --> 23:40.879
- So... Luke has to do what
I tell him.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.964
- Uh, well, yes,

23:43.006 --> 23:45.342
but you have to tell him
the right instructions.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.844
So go ahead and give Luke
a little spin to disorient him.

23:47.886 --> 23:49.888
- Honey, what's all this?

23:49.929 --> 23:51.973
- Well, since you
and grandpa

23:52.015 --> 23:53.475
are too busy fighting
with Mitch

23:53.516 --> 23:55.643
to set a good example
for the younger generation,

23:55.685 --> 23:57.979
I've taken matters into
my own hands.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.732
Finally gonna get Luke
and Katie to bond

24:00.774 --> 24:03.735
through exercises in listening
and in trusting.

24:03.777 --> 24:05.028
- He's gonna be sick.

24:05.070 --> 24:07.113
- Oh, Katie, okay, enough!
Stop!

24:07.155 --> 24:08.615
Are you, Luke, you good?
You okay?

24:08.656 --> 24:10.617
- (Nauseous moan)

24:10.658 --> 24:13.078
- Okay. (Sighs)

24:13.119 --> 24:15.663
Anyway, before I forget,
are you free tomorrow?

24:15.705 --> 24:17.123
Georgie has a competition.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.750
- What? Georgie's jumping
again?

24:18.792 --> 24:20.710
- Yeah, thanks to Quinn.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.212
I mean, you may not like him,
but...

24:22.253 --> 24:24.214
he's growing on me.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.675
- Agh! Ungh!
- (Amused) Huh.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.510
- All right,
can it be my turn now?

24:30.345 --> 24:33.515
- Good luck.
- (Disapproving exhale)

24:35.266 --> 24:37.352
- All right, we're gonna take
three strides with an oxer,
not four.

24:37.394 --> 24:38.687
<i>Stay light on his back.</i>

24:44.317 --> 24:46.778
She's amazing, right?

24:47.862 --> 24:49.114
<i>- She was amazing long before</i>
<i>you started</i>

24:49.155 --> 24:50.824
barking orders at her, buddy.

24:50.865 --> 24:53.284
- Oh, come on, Mr. Fleming,

24:53.326 --> 24:55.662
we both know Georgie doesn't
take orders from anyone.

24:58.915 --> 25:01.960
- I was so quick to blame
Georgie,

25:02.002 --> 25:04.713
and it was me the entire time.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.966
I'm just... mortified.

25:09.509 --> 25:12.095
- It's over and done now.
The horse is found.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.972
The mistake's been fixed.

25:14.014 --> 25:16.433
- It was a mistake that should
not have been made!

25:16.474 --> 25:19.644
- You... need to stop worrying,

25:19.686 --> 25:21.062
<i>come on.</i>

25:21.104 --> 25:23.690
- I think... I think I need
to face facts.

25:25.108 --> 25:27.152
I've taken on too much.
I'm overwhelmed,

25:27.193 --> 25:30.071
and I'm... I'm making mistakes.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.533
I'm tired.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.912
I think I should consider
retirement.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.998
- What? You're too young
for that.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.334
- Honestly...

25:42.375 --> 25:45.045
I've always pictured...

25:45.086 --> 25:48.214
doing it on the early side.
And, and before we met,

25:48.256 --> 25:50.925
I thought I would be living
full time in France by now.

25:53.928 --> 25:56.014
What do you think?

25:56.056 --> 25:58.266
Would you consider retirement?

26:01.394 --> 26:04.814
Caleb: Hey, guys!
Want some company?

26:04.856 --> 26:06.066
- Hi!
- Hey!

26:08.443 --> 26:10.111
- (Sighs heavily)

26:10.153 --> 26:13.073
- So... how are the art classes
going?

26:13.114 --> 26:15.075
- Oh, fine. I think we're all
a little disappointed

26:15.116 --> 26:17.035
that Jane's not painting
with us.

26:17.077 --> 26:19.287
- Honestly, if I'd known Jane
wasn't gonna paint,

26:19.329 --> 26:21.164
I wouldn't have signed up.

26:21.206 --> 26:22.957
- I know. You seen some of her
latest pieces?

26:22.999 --> 26:25.418
I mean, her style has
completely changed.

26:25.460 --> 26:27.921
<i>- Yeah, it's like more abstract</i>
<i>or something, right?</i>

26:27.962 --> 26:29.214
<i>- Yeah.</i>

26:29.255 --> 26:30.882
- So where are we gonna
head out tomorrow?

26:30.924 --> 26:32.967
- Wha... wait.

26:34.344 --> 26:36.346
You're not... coming to class?

26:36.388 --> 26:38.264
- No. Um...

26:38.306 --> 26:40.475
is that not okay?

26:40.517 --> 26:44.104
- Well, I, I mean,
fishing was a one-time deal.

26:44.145 --> 26:45.980
- (Sighs) Cass...

26:47.440 --> 26:49.234
art's just not my thing.

26:51.361 --> 26:53.530
- (Unamused laugh)

26:53.571 --> 26:56.324
Well, maybe I'm not either.

26:58.993 --> 27:00.912
- (Sighs heavily)

27:00.954 --> 27:02.789
'Scuse me.

27:06.876 --> 27:08.628
- Jane?
- Amy!

27:10.088 --> 27:12.924
How'd it go today?
Make any progress?

27:12.966 --> 27:14.259
- Honestly, no, not a lot.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.220
But I think I might know why.

27:17.262 --> 27:19.014
Something... came to me over
dinner.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.934
- You never know when
inspiration will strike, huh?

27:22.976 --> 27:25.020
So, what's the theory?

27:25.061 --> 27:26.938
- Well, I took Canvas out on
a trail today,

27:26.980 --> 27:29.024
and we saw that cougar.

27:29.065 --> 27:30.817
- Oh no...
- No, that's the thing.

27:30.859 --> 27:32.444
Canvas was great.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.946
<i>He responded to my directions</i>
<i>perfectly.</i>

27:34.988 --> 27:38.033
So it got me thinking that
maybe he was acting out

27:38.074 --> 27:39.701
not because he was afraid,

27:39.743 --> 27:43.329
but because he was sensing
something going on with you.

27:43.371 --> 27:46.332
<i>So if there is something</i>
<i>you're holding back,</i>

27:46.374 --> 27:47.959
it would be helpful for me
to know.

27:48.001 --> 27:49.336
- There isn't.

27:52.213 --> 27:55.550
I asked you here to help
my horse, Amy. Not me.

27:55.592 --> 27:58.053
So, please, don't play
therapist.

27:59.471 --> 28:01.222
Good night.

28:06.978 --> 28:11.274
**

28:11.316 --> 28:12.359
- Good boy.

28:13.610 --> 28:16.071
You did so good today.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.239
Guess we just needed a little
time together, huh?

28:18.281 --> 28:20.158
(Chuckles)

28:20.200 --> 28:22.118
Ho...

28:22.160 --> 28:23.828
<i>- Hey!</i>

28:23.870 --> 28:26.164
I'm glad I found you.

28:26.206 --> 28:28.124
I wanted to apologize
for last night.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.460
- No, Jane, you don't have to.
- I wasn't being fair...

28:30.502 --> 28:33.380
'cause you don't know
the truth.

28:35.256 --> 28:38.843
I'm in the early stages
of macular degeneration.

28:38.885 --> 28:41.012
I'm...

28:41.054 --> 28:42.430
I'm going blind.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.684
- Jane, I... I'm so sorry.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.520
- I didn't mean to keep it
from you.

28:48.561 --> 28:52.273
I thought Canvas' issue
was his, not mine.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.234
But, of course,
he'd sense my stress.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.444
It makes sense;
he's very intuitive.

28:58.238 --> 29:00.490
The truth is...

29:00.532 --> 29:03.201
I'm scared to ride, Amy,

29:03.243 --> 29:05.954
for the first time in my life.

29:05.995 --> 29:08.540
I can, I can still see
well enough,

29:08.581 --> 29:12.460
but my vision's getting worse
by the day.

29:12.502 --> 29:15.505
- Canvas picks up on that;
that's what he's reacting to.

29:15.547 --> 29:18.091
- (Scoffs)
An artist going blind.

29:18.133 --> 29:21.970
It's just so horribly cliché,
isn't it?

29:22.012 --> 29:23.596
I've built my career on...

29:23.638 --> 29:26.266
painting horses
out in the wild.

29:26.307 --> 29:28.435
My art and my riding,
they go hand in hand.

29:31.146 --> 29:33.898
If I can't ride, I can't paint.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.567
- I disagree.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.485
And I'd like to show you why,
if you'll let me.

29:39.571 --> 29:40.947
- Okay.

29:44.659 --> 29:46.619
- We're just having fun,
remember?

29:46.661 --> 29:49.122
- Okay, I know.

29:49.164 --> 29:50.999
(Phone rings,
Georgie blows out her breath)

29:56.504 --> 29:57.505
- Hey, Dad.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.801
No, the horse is on its way
back now.

30:01.843 --> 30:04.637
So I think that I should stay
until--

30:04.679 --> 30:07.557
No, that's a perfectly good
reason.

30:07.599 --> 30:10.268
Just look, a couple more days--

30:12.270 --> 30:14.397
Yes, sir.

30:14.439 --> 30:16.858
Yeah. Understood.
I'll book my flight.

30:19.069 --> 30:20.278
- (Blows out her breath)

30:23.698 --> 30:26.117
- Wow! There she is.

30:26.159 --> 30:27.494
You look amazing.

30:27.535 --> 30:28.536
Oh, and we gotta go.

30:30.038 --> 30:32.165
- Yeah, I just need to grab
my jacket. (Clears her throat)

30:32.207 --> 30:33.500
- All right.

30:35.043 --> 30:36.961
- (Sighs heavily)

30:37.003 --> 30:39.172
(Blows out her breath)

30:41.174 --> 30:42.634
(Door clanks)

30:42.676 --> 30:45.345
Lou: Are you guys nervous?
I'm, I'm nervous.

30:45.387 --> 30:48.098
Like I feel like this is
a big deal, right?

30:48.139 --> 30:50.642
Hey, Dad.
Uh, maybe I should go up,

30:50.684 --> 30:53.853
you know, see if she's okay,
feeling, feeling good.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.689
- Just don't give her another
pep talk.

30:55.730 --> 30:57.399
- What do you mean?

30:57.440 --> 30:59.776
- Telling Georgie that this was
her big comeback?

30:59.818 --> 31:01.653
(Snorts) Did you see her face?

31:01.695 --> 31:04.114
- I thought she was gonna puke.

31:04.155 --> 31:06.324
- No pressure. Just win it all.

31:06.366 --> 31:08.785
- Okay, you guys, I was just
being supportive.

31:08.827 --> 31:10.787
- But you can be a bit intense
sometimes.

31:10.829 --> 31:13.039
- Sometimes?! Are you kidding?

31:13.081 --> 31:14.582
- (Laughs) I know. So true.

31:14.624 --> 31:16.668
- Okay, now hold on a second.
- (Laughs) Lou...

31:16.710 --> 31:18.628
Both: (Laughing)

31:18.670 --> 31:20.714
- You guys--
- (Laughing) Lou...

31:20.755 --> 31:22.340
I thought you wanted
these two to bond?

31:22.382 --> 31:23.800
- Yeah, but--
- Well, look at them.

31:23.842 --> 31:27.220
They're laughing. I mean,
who cares if it's at you?

31:27.262 --> 31:29.014
They're laughing.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.306
(Laughing)

31:30.348 --> 31:32.183
(Hooves clop)

31:32.225 --> 31:34.269
Hey, hey, hey.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.312
Why the long face?

31:36.354 --> 31:38.440
- Nothing. Just... family stuff.

31:38.481 --> 31:39.733
They want me to come home.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.192
- What, so what,
you're leaving?

31:41.234 --> 31:42.527
- Yeah. Isn't that what you
wanted?

31:42.569 --> 31:44.779
- No. I want what's best
for Georgie.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.573
- So do I.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.283
- 'Kay, well, don't mess it up.

31:50.243 --> 31:52.537
- All right.
(Phoenix nickers)

31:52.579 --> 31:53.621
(Hooves thud)

31:56.583 --> 31:58.209
<i>Lou: Hey!</i>

31:58.251 --> 31:59.586
You ready to go?

31:59.627 --> 32:01.379
- I'm sorry, I...

32:02.714 --> 32:04.299
I don't think I can do this.

32:08.678 --> 32:10.388
<i>Lou: Georgie...</i>

32:17.437 --> 32:18.646
- Hey.

32:20.231 --> 32:22.817
What happened?! We had this!

32:22.859 --> 32:25.570
- I'm not ready.

32:25.612 --> 32:27.489
And there's no "we"
since you're leaving.

32:29.866 --> 32:32.660
- Wow. So we're back to that,
are we?

32:32.702 --> 32:35.914
You're just gonna push me away
again, like Europe?

32:35.955 --> 32:37.665
Seriously, when are you gonna
stop running?

32:37.707 --> 32:39.542
- I'm not running.
- Yes, you are!

32:39.584 --> 32:41.670
From anyone who dares chip away
at that wall

32:41.711 --> 32:42.837
you've got built around
yourself.

32:42.879 --> 32:45.256
- That's funny.
- That's not the word

32:45.298 --> 32:47.634
that I was gonna go with.

32:47.676 --> 32:49.344
- You're mad at me for running
from my problems

32:49.386 --> 32:51.596
when that's exactly
what you're doing.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.056
- No, I'm not.

32:53.098 --> 32:55.141
I'm here, aren't I?!

32:55.183 --> 32:57.602
- Exactly. You're here.

32:57.644 --> 32:58.853
You didn't wanna join
the family business

32:58.895 --> 33:01.731
so you ran away to Hudson.

33:01.773 --> 33:04.275
I'm just an excuse
so you can avoid your reality.

33:06.861 --> 33:08.655
- No, you aren't.

33:10.865 --> 33:13.326
And I am facing reality,
all right?

33:13.368 --> 33:14.953
I'm going home.

33:14.994 --> 33:17.038
It's the last thing
that I wanna do.

33:21.751 --> 33:25.505
What I want is to be here
with you a little longer.

33:25.547 --> 33:27.674
I mean, this could be something,
Georgie.

33:27.716 --> 33:29.718
And I know that
it's not convenient,

33:29.759 --> 33:32.429
but does that mean it's not
worth fighting for?

33:32.470 --> 33:35.056
I don't know,
but I wanna find out.

33:36.349 --> 33:37.726
You just have to want that too.

33:40.979 --> 33:43.481
Just... so give me a reason
to stay and I will.

33:44.816 --> 33:46.568
Can you do that for me?

33:48.153 --> 33:49.696
Can you?

33:54.701 --> 33:56.494
- This is why I said goodbye
in Europe.

33:58.538 --> 34:00.457
You shouldn't have come here.

34:00.498 --> 34:10.425
**

34:10.467 --> 34:16.598
**

34:19.684 --> 34:22.687
- There's no rule that the
visually impaired can't ride,

34:22.728 --> 34:24.856
especially if they're
experienced like you are.

34:24.898 --> 34:26.358
You just have to trust
your horse.

34:26.399 --> 34:27.984
- Well, I already do.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.987
- Absolutely. You two have
a great bond,

34:31.029 --> 34:33.614
but now you have to trust in it
completely.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.533
I want you to close your eyes.

34:37.619 --> 34:40.871
Now clear your mind and focus
on your movements.

34:40.914 --> 34:43.248
You see how in sync they are
with Canvas's?

34:43.291 --> 34:45.085
- Yes, I think so. Huh.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.629
- Good.

34:49.339 --> 34:51.882
Now, remember how this feels.

34:51.925 --> 34:54.678
And whenever you're out riding
and you feel unsure,

34:54.719 --> 34:58.431
come back to it,
to how these movements feel.

34:58.473 --> 35:01.685
Because being secure with
your horse isn't about seeing,

35:01.726 --> 35:02.769
it's about feeling.

35:04.062 --> 35:06.398
- Just like painting.
- Exactly.

35:07.899 --> 35:10.110
Okay. I think you two are ready
for a trail ride.

35:11.486 --> 35:12.737
- Okay.

35:12.779 --> 35:15.407
(River flows,
fishing line whirs)

35:16.825 --> 35:18.743
- Crazy night, huh?

35:18.785 --> 35:20.829
Women.

35:20.870 --> 35:22.789
Cass is really giving me
the silent treatment

35:22.831 --> 35:24.290
on this one, Jack.

35:24.332 --> 35:26.418
- Must be nice.

35:26.459 --> 35:28.545
- No, not really.

35:28.586 --> 35:32.298
I don't mind all the stuff
that Cass signs us up for,

35:32.340 --> 35:34.342
It's just...
like I got this feeling

35:35.802 --> 35:38.596
like she's doing it to hide
how she feels,

35:38.638 --> 35:40.473
you know, about us not getting
pregnant.

35:40.515 --> 35:42.600
- Look, Caleb,
I know it's tough.

35:42.642 --> 35:44.602
- I feel stuck,

35:44.644 --> 35:46.479
like we're not moving forward.

35:46.521 --> 35:48.314
- Well...

35:48.356 --> 35:50.942
before you move anywhere,

35:50.984 --> 35:52.819
maybe you oughta take
a step back

35:52.861 --> 35:55.697
and get some perspective.

35:55.739 --> 35:57.532
You have a wife who loves you,

35:57.574 --> 36:00.869
who wants to spend time
with you - that's good.

36:00.910 --> 36:04.706
Sounds to me like you're
at a bit of a crossroads.

36:04.748 --> 36:07.334
You know something needs
to change

36:07.375 --> 36:09.919
but you're not sure what.

36:09.961 --> 36:12.839
Oddly enough, I can relate.

36:12.881 --> 36:14.966
<i>The two of you is enough,</i>
<i>Caleb.</i>

36:15.008 --> 36:17.552
Trust me, it's all you'll
ever need.

36:18.720 --> 36:19.846
- Thanks, Jack.

36:22.349 --> 36:23.725
I owe you one.

36:25.727 --> 36:27.562
(Footsteps splash)

36:30.774 --> 36:31.816
(Rock clatters)
Whoa!

36:31.858 --> 36:33.360
(Loud splash)

36:33.401 --> 36:35.653
(Gasps)

36:40.158 --> 36:43.328
- Well, now you owe me two.

36:43.370 --> 36:44.746
(Water splashes)

36:49.876 --> 36:51.836
- I'm impressed.
You two have come a long way

36:51.878 --> 36:53.797
in a short time.

36:53.838 --> 36:55.882
- Starting to feel like my old
self again, that's for sure.

36:55.924 --> 36:58.009
- Well, I can tell.
And pretty soon

36:58.051 --> 37:00.595
you'll be able to rely on
Canvas completely.

37:00.637 --> 37:02.847
- What, like a seeing-eye
horse?

37:02.889 --> 37:04.933
- Well, sort of.

37:04.974 --> 37:06.434
Here, let me show you.

37:09.020 --> 37:15.527
**

37:15.568 --> 37:17.612
(Hooves thunder)

37:20.532 --> 37:26.746
**

37:26.788 --> 37:29.541
- I've never seen anything
quite like you two.

37:29.582 --> 37:31.835
You share a very special
connection.

37:31.876 --> 37:33.545
- And so do you and Canvas.

37:33.586 --> 37:35.380
You just have to trust in it.

37:40.427 --> 37:41.553
- Hmm.

37:45.390 --> 37:46.641
- Hey!

37:46.683 --> 37:48.309
Caleb.

37:51.146 --> 37:53.148
I've been trying to find
the right moment

37:53.189 --> 37:55.900
all weekend to talk to you,
but...

37:55.942 --> 37:58.820
I think we just kept fishing,
so...

37:58.862 --> 38:00.905
I'm just gonna say it.
- Wait.

38:00.947 --> 38:02.991
Me first.

38:03.033 --> 38:05.118
Baby, I'm sorry
I haven't been around.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.704
I... I needed to think.

38:07.746 --> 38:09.831
And what I think is... (sighs)

38:11.624 --> 38:13.626
I'm so, I'm so happy with this.

38:13.668 --> 38:17.297
This, just the two of us,
it's perfect.

38:19.966 --> 38:21.926
- Well, it's not gonna be
the two of us much longer.

38:21.968 --> 38:24.054
- What?

38:24.095 --> 38:25.638
- I'm pregnant, cowboy.

38:26.931 --> 38:28.183
- No!

38:28.224 --> 38:30.477
- Yup. Yeah, yeah.

38:30.518 --> 38:30.852
- Oh God!

38:31.770 --> 38:33.980
(Kissing)
A baby!

38:36.858 --> 38:39.152
(Birds chirp, river flows)

38:39.194 --> 38:40.695
- Been thinking...
- Oh?

38:40.737 --> 38:42.572
- (Laughs)

38:42.614 --> 38:44.699
and you might be right.

38:44.741 --> 38:48.078
Maybe, you and me,
we do need a bit of a shift.

38:48.119 --> 38:49.954
And if retirement's really
what you want,

38:49.996 --> 38:51.623
I'm more than happy
to talk about it.

38:51.664 --> 38:53.041
- You know what?
I've just been so--

38:53.083 --> 38:55.168
- Hey! Are you guys ready
to go?

38:55.210 --> 38:56.836
- Yeah.

38:56.878 --> 38:58.672
<i>Caleb: Yes! Yes!</i>
<i>(Running footsteps)</i>

38:58.713 --> 39:00.674
<i>Guys! Guys!</i>

39:00.715 --> 39:02.801
Oh, Jack, we're pregnant!

39:02.842 --> 39:04.719
- (Laughs)
- YEAH!

39:04.761 --> 39:06.304
- Well, congratulations!
Amy: That's amazing!

39:06.346 --> 39:09.724
Cass: Thank you.
Both: (Laughing)

39:09.766 --> 39:11.976
- I don't need to retire,
honey. I really don't.

39:12.018 --> 39:14.020
I just need this,
I need to breathe,

39:14.062 --> 39:16.231
and get perspective,
and take a break.

39:16.272 --> 39:18.733
- Yeah.
- Aw...

39:18.775 --> 39:21.069
<i>they're about to start the</i>
<i>craziest chapter in their life.</i>

39:23.738 --> 39:25.073
I'm not ready
to change our chapter.

39:25.115 --> 39:27.575
I like the page that we're on.

39:27.617 --> 39:29.077
- Me, too.

39:31.079 --> 39:32.539
- Because um...

39:32.580 --> 39:34.833
I'm um...

39:34.874 --> 39:37.085
I'm clearly not quitting
my day job.

39:38.586 --> 39:40.714
- Wow.
- Uh-huh.

39:40.755 --> 39:43.591
Yup, well, let's go celebrate
with the kids, shall we?

39:43.633 --> 39:45.093
(Laughing)

39:47.220 --> 39:49.723
(Lock clanks)

39:49.764 --> 39:52.183
- I wanted to come say goodbye
and to give you this.

39:52.225 --> 39:54.853
- Oh, you didn't need to do...

39:54.894 --> 39:57.689
Jane, this is...

39:57.731 --> 39:59.441
so beautiful.

40:01.943 --> 40:03.945
- Like I said, you never know
when inspiration will strike.

40:05.739 --> 40:08.074
Thank you, Amy, for everything.

40:08.116 --> 40:09.659
Not only did you get me riding
again,

40:09.701 --> 40:12.203
you, you got me painting.

40:12.245 --> 40:13.663
- You know that painting that
you gave Ty

40:13.705 --> 40:15.665
all those years ago?
- Mm-hmm.

40:15.707 --> 40:17.000
- It's still hanging on
our wall.

40:17.042 --> 40:19.669
It's very special to us.
- My painting?

40:19.711 --> 40:20.920
But... it wasn't lost in
the crash?

40:20.962 --> 40:23.173
I'd just assumed.

40:23.214 --> 40:26.926
- No, that's what brought Ty
home to me.

40:26.968 --> 40:29.596
And to say that I'm...
grateful to you is...

40:30.930 --> 40:32.599
it's not enough.

40:35.518 --> 40:36.644
Thank you.

40:38.271 --> 40:40.190
(Birds chirp)

40:40.231 --> 40:41.608
(Phone line ringing)

40:45.779 --> 40:47.238
- Hey!

40:47.280 --> 40:49.157
Made you some breakfast.

40:50.909 --> 40:52.160
Are you okay?

40:54.329 --> 40:55.789
Honey, I'm sorry.

40:55.830 --> 40:57.582
I, I didn't mean to put
any pressure on you.

40:58.792 --> 41:01.711
- It's Quinn.

41:01.753 --> 41:04.547
- Quinn?

41:04.589 --> 41:05.840
Why?

41:05.882 --> 41:08.677
What happened?

41:08.718 --> 41:09.844
- I just got in my head.

41:12.430 --> 41:14.099
I heard him say that
he was leaving

41:14.140 --> 41:15.642
and then... suddenly,

41:16.851 --> 41:19.062
I was back at camp,

41:19.104 --> 41:21.064
facing this long-distance
relationship

41:21.106 --> 41:23.358
that would... hurt too much.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.693
(Footsteps on stairs)

41:29.322 --> 41:31.032
- What's wrong? Did he leave?

41:32.659 --> 41:34.869
(Huffs)

41:34.911 --> 41:35.954
Doesn't surprise me.

41:37.789 --> 41:39.416
- He left because I told him to.

41:39.457 --> 41:41.209
- What'd he do?
- Nothing.

41:43.294 --> 41:44.838
He did everything right.

41:44.879 --> 41:46.715
- (Sympathetic sigh)

41:46.756 --> 41:48.258
- I think I've just...

41:48.299 --> 41:49.968
made a big mistake.

41:53.013 --> 41:54.014
(Crying)

41:54.055 --> 41:56.391
* Are you lost *

41:56.433 --> 41:59.102
* Are you lonely *

41:59.144 --> 42:01.187
* Are you missing
your one and only *

42:01.229 --> 42:03.815
* Starting to write the end
of your story *

42:03.857 --> 42:06.026
* You're alive... *

42:06.067 --> 42:08.445
* Are you breathin' *

42:08.486 --> 42:10.780
* Have you lost
all the feelin' *

42:10.822 --> 42:13.366
* In your fingers and toes,
body and soul *

42:13.408 --> 42:15.744
* And nothing seems
to be working *

42:15.785 --> 42:18.246
* When it all falls down *

42:20.331 --> 42:22.751
* When it all falls down *

42:24.419 --> 42:27.839
* We just gotta get back,
get back *

42:27.881 --> 42:30.175
* Get back to that moment *

42:30.216 --> 42:32.469
<i>* Get back, get back *</i>

42:32.510 --> 42:34.888
* Get back to that moment *

42:34.929 --> 42:37.349
* Get back, get back *

42:37.390 --> 42:39.309
* Get back to that moment *

42:39.351 --> 42:42.270
* Where it all began *
- Ho...

42:43.980 --> 42:46.775
Ho...
* Where it all began... *

42:49.402 --> 42:51.488
And up!

42:51.529 --> 42:54.032
* Get back, get back *

42:54.074 --> 42:56.284
* Get back to that moment *

42:56.326 --> 42:57.994
It's okay.

42:58.036 --> 42:59.746
It's okay, Spartan.

43:01.873 --> 43:03.375
You're a good boy.
* Get back *

43:03.416 --> 43:05.418
* Get back to that moment *

43:05.460 --> 43:07.629
* Where it all began *

43:09.547 --> 43:13.009
* We just gotta get back,
get back *

43:13.051 --> 43:15.261
* Get back to that moment *

43:15.303 --> 43:17.847
* Get back, get back *

43:17.889 --> 43:20.308
* Get back to that moment *

43:20.350 --> 43:22.394
* Get back, get back *
You're a good boy.

43:22.435 --> 43:24.521
* Get back to that moment *

43:24.562 --> 43:27.107
* Where it all began *
Good boy.

43:28.858 --> 43:32.320
* Oh, where it all began *
