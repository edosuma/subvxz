WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:02.269
Previously on Legacies...
You know, I opened this school

00:02.269 --> 00:04.271
to protect these kids.
How am I supposed to

00:04.271 --> 00:08.208
protect them from stuff
that's not supposed to exist?

00:08.208 --> 00:09.510
HOPE:
It can't be a
coincidence.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.378
You're all coming
after the same thing.

00:11.378 --> 00:12.446
If I return the knife

00:12.446 --> 00:14.181
to Malivore, I will be free.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.650
LANDON: What's Malivore?
HOPE: It's a hell dimension

00:16.650 --> 00:18.085
that consumes creatures
and wipes their existence

00:18.085 --> 00:19.519
from the collective conscience.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.687
Three locks created

00:20.687 --> 00:22.923
to seal Malivore shut.

00:22.923 --> 00:25.525
When all three locks
return home,

00:25.525 --> 00:29.329
Malivore is free to open
its jaws of death once again.

00:29.329 --> 00:31.698
There's something that happens
to twins born into your coven.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.766
When you turn 22,

00:32.766 --> 00:34.701
the Gemini must merge.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.303
LIZZIE:
So, one of us is gonna

00:36.303 --> 00:37.838
have to kill the other one?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.373
RAFAEL:
I keep having these flashes

00:39.373 --> 00:40.974
like I can't
control myself, and...

00:40.974 --> 00:42.976
Use this. When you use it,
you can turn yourself at will.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.245
You can't turn yourself back.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.747
All you have to do
is come find me

00:46.747 --> 00:48.382
when you're ready
to be yourself again.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.317
You're asking me to
believe that my father

00:50.317 --> 00:51.718
is in Malivore.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.720
You are what he's been
trying to create.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.989
Now I need you to tell me
which is the real lock,

00:55.989 --> 00:57.724
so we can set him free.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.259
They lost their
trail, but...

00:59.259 --> 01:00.527
they did find this.

01:00.527 --> 01:01.995
I know where they're going.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.263
Prep your team.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.771
Triad kidnapped Landon
after all.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.539
And Hope needs help, so...

01:12.539 --> 01:13.941
I got to bounce.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.509
After you let me out of here?

01:15.509 --> 01:16.910
That's Dr. Saltzman's call.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.211
I hope he gets here soon.

01:18.211 --> 01:19.746
I need to go home.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.914
My family needs me.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.382
(whooshing)

01:25.385 --> 01:26.520
Ma?

01:29.489 --> 01:31.792
Power's down. Move in.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.929
Hey, you okay?

01:35.929 --> 01:39.266
Um... my mind still
won't settle down.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.802
Look, I'm sorry,
but I can't join the fight.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.904
Don't worry, I'm
not going alone.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.807
HOPE:
My squad answered
the Bat-Signal.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.049
BOTH:
She's coming?

01:56.049 --> 01:57.551
I need all the help I can get,

01:57.551 --> 01:59.386
so please put
your twin war on pause.

01:59.386 --> 02:00.620
Why is he going?

02:00.620 --> 02:02.522
He hates Landon.
Look, you're the Alpha.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.658
If Landon's your pack,
that makes him ours.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.493
Where's MG at?
HOPE:
He's on his way.

02:06.493 --> 02:08.395
Let's load up while we wait
for him. Come on.

02:12.766 --> 02:16.903
Oh, sorry. We were
about to knock.

02:16.903 --> 02:17.904
Who the hell are you?

02:17.904 --> 02:19.039
Name's Burr.

02:19.039 --> 02:20.507
Triad Industries.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.509
Propellere.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.314
I got this.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.517
(sizzling)
(groans)

02:32.819 --> 02:34.654
What you don't got is magic.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.657
Which is why your
daylight ring won't work.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.525
And what we have
are stakes,

02:38.525 --> 02:42.429
wolfsbane... and other things.

02:42.429 --> 02:45.932
So I think you should
invite us inside.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.676
DORIAN: I know I agreed
to resume all my duties

02:56.676 --> 02:59.079
back at the school, but being
your designated driver

02:59.079 --> 03:01.882
was not one of them.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.617
ALARIC: Just take it easy
on the turns.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.385
I'm still a little drunk.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.521
DORIAN:
What's going on up there?

03:11.958 --> 03:14.061
Morning, Officer.
What's the holdup?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.662
Dr. Saltzman.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.664
Uh, Wickery Bridge
is closed.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.499
Why?

03:19.499 --> 03:20.567
Someone blew it up.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.971
We're looking for an artifact

03:24.971 --> 03:27.974
known as
the Chalice of Arimathea.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.676
We have reason to believe

03:29.676 --> 03:32.913
it's part of
your school's collection.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.382
Now, you know this place
a lot better than we do,

03:35.382 --> 03:39.453
so the sooner
you help us find it,

03:39.453 --> 03:42.055
the sooner we'll be gone.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.790
Triad thanks you for your time.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.565
What is this place?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.600
A warehouse owned
by my employer.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.068
Stores all the
supernatural objects

03:55.068 --> 03:56.870
they've confiscated
over the years.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.705
Think you mean former employers.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.474
'Cause busting me out
is gonna make for

04:00.474 --> 04:02.609
a pretty awkward
performance review.

04:02.609 --> 04:05.445
If you're worried about them
following us, don't be.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.747
Okay, well, if it's here,
how are we gonna find it?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.483
This place is a haystack.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.418
Figure it out, little brother.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.620
Your family's counting on you.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.706
I can explain.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.040
Where are we?

04:34.040 --> 04:35.709
Underneath the school.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.978
This tunnel is gonna lead
you outside the gates.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.679
Your daylight ring
will start to work again

04:39.679 --> 04:40.814
once you clear the perimeter.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.717
Why is my daylight ring
not working?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.585
And how do you know
that it's not?

04:45.585 --> 04:47.554
This fountain.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.523
It nullifies the magic
inside the school.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.391
That's how we got
in undetected.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.059
"We"?
Triad.

04:53.059 --> 04:55.562
You're working
with the bad guys?

04:55.562 --> 04:56.696
We are the good guys.

04:56.696 --> 04:58.431
I don't see it like that.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.566
We'll talk about this later.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.168
Right now I'm trying to prevent

05:01.168 --> 05:03.170
one of nature's greatest evils
from rising up,

05:03.170 --> 05:05.105
so if you could just go...

05:23.056 --> 05:24.124
(dart gun clicks, whooshes)

05:24.124 --> 05:25.826
(gasps)

05:41.575 --> 05:43.076
(phone buttons clicking)
(Hope sighs)

05:43.076 --> 05:45.679
It's dead.
We have to find the school cell.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.147
Check MG's tighty-whities.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.549
Really? This is serious.
LIZZIE: Oh, I'm sorry.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.985
We can't all be born with
resting concerned pouty face.

05:51.985 --> 05:52.986
(gasps)
HOPE:
Didn't this shelf

05:52.986 --> 05:54.221
used to have books on it?

05:54.221 --> 05:56.723
Yeah. That's weird.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.162
Whatever they're doing
to block out our magic

06:02.162 --> 06:04.164
must have knocked out
a cloaking spell your dad had.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.067
Big shocker.
Dad's hiding something from us.

06:08.435 --> 06:09.636
Unless it has
the school phone in it,

06:09.636 --> 06:10.637
it doesn't matter.

06:11.671 --> 06:12.772
Sorry I don't feel like laughing

06:12.772 --> 06:13.840
while my world's falling apart.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.175
LIZZIE:
Your world?

06:15.175 --> 06:16.643
What about my world?

06:16.643 --> 06:17.844
I'm the one who's eventually

06:17.844 --> 06:19.813
going to be absorbed
by my own twin.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.114
If you lose the Merge.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.183
Which I'm obviously going to.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.051
I'm the weak, broken one.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.654
And like clockwork-- victim.

06:27.654 --> 06:28.788
HOPE:
Hey, guys.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.790
Found it.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.392
(phone rings)

06:33.860 --> 06:35.695
Whoever this is
gets extra credit.

06:35.695 --> 06:36.696
It's Hope.

06:36.696 --> 06:37.931
Triad's here.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.099
Is everyone okay?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.734
Yeah, but our powers are gone.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.871
What do they want?

06:44.871 --> 06:45.939
They said
that the third artifact

06:45.939 --> 06:47.007
is in the school somewhere.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.708
You're kidding.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.010
The Chalice of Arithmetic
or something?

06:50.010 --> 06:51.711
I don't know. Any idea?

06:51.711 --> 06:53.813
We don't have the Chalice
of Arimathea, do we?

06:53.813 --> 06:55.215
I'd have to check
the old Armory records,

06:55.215 --> 06:56.850
but not to my knowledge.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.618
Uh, listen, I, uh...

06:58.618 --> 07:00.487
I've got to find my
way into the school.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.489
But just promise me you're
not gonna do anything crazy.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.491
We're not the only ones
in danger. Landon is, too.

07:04.491 --> 07:05.892
I can't just stand here
and do nothing.

07:05.892 --> 07:07.627
Hope, for once in your life,

07:07.627 --> 07:09.496
will you please
just listen to me?

07:09.496 --> 07:11.164
If Triad wants the chalice,
help them get the chalice.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.632
You don't have your powers.
You are vulnerable,

07:12.632 --> 07:14.167
and if you try to resist,

07:14.167 --> 07:16.102
someone could get hurt.
Do you understand me?

07:17.103 --> 07:18.838
Yeah.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.774
Any ideas how
we're getting in?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.176
Just one. But we're not.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.978
You're staying here.

07:28.515 --> 07:29.916
So, what do we do now?
Now...

07:29.916 --> 07:31.685
we figure out a way
to get our powers back,

07:31.685 --> 07:33.053
and we kick
some paramilitary ass.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.221
Wait, Dad said
not to do anything crazy.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.490
Me defying your dad isn't crazy.
It's consistent.

07:37.490 --> 07:38.358
(door opens)

07:38.358 --> 07:40.427
Well, at least
we know where you stand.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.363
You're damn right we do.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.998
You're not very scared of me,

07:44.998 --> 07:46.900
are you?

07:46.900 --> 07:49.102
How about now?

07:49.102 --> 07:51.271
(chuckles):
That's your plan?

07:51.271 --> 07:53.373
You're gonna shoot a kid?
This gun would never harm

07:53.373 --> 07:54.908
a human child.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.743
You three, however...

07:57.977 --> 08:00.080
These bullets
were formed from

08:00.080 --> 08:01.481
the mud of the Malivore pit

08:01.481 --> 08:03.249
and weaponized
by Triad scientists.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.452
They can break the skin
of any supernatural

08:05.452 --> 08:08.054
like a hot knife through butter.

08:08.054 --> 08:10.323
Fester. Infect them.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.126
Disintegrate them
from the inside out.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.863
We don't know
where the chalice is.

08:16.863 --> 08:19.099
I believe you.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.669
This is just for fun, really.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.071
Eeny...

08:26.406 --> 08:27.974
...meeny...

08:29.342 --> 08:30.844
...miney...

08:33.813 --> 08:34.948
Moe.

08:38.418 --> 08:41.888
(gasping)

08:44.991 --> 08:46.860
It's okay.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.695
It's okay. It's okay.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.099
Lock them up.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.977
LIZZIE: What the hell
is wrong with you?

09:03.977 --> 09:05.612
With me?

09:05.612 --> 09:07.514
You practically begged him
to shoot you.

09:07.514 --> 09:08.915
Because, if I'm destined
to die in my prime,

09:08.915 --> 09:11.151
it may as well be in a blaze
of hero glory.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.886
You are unbelievably selfish.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.288
Who took it upon herself
to dive in front of my bullet?

09:15.288 --> 09:17.690
I thought that
your codependent days were over.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.025
A regrettable relapse.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.360
Ow!

09:20.360 --> 09:22.362
Hey! Keep it quiet in there.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.631
We're not in the
prison yard, asshat.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.103
(sighs)

09:31.171 --> 09:33.840
You guys, I'm so sorry.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.375
I mean, I dragged
you both into this,

09:35.375 --> 09:38.445
and I have absolutely no idea
how to get us out of it.

09:38.445 --> 09:41.815
Well, that is
just not good enough, Hope.

09:41.815 --> 09:45.318
My sister is clearly dying,
and we did not wait ten years

09:45.318 --> 09:48.188
to become friends with you
for you to not come through

09:48.188 --> 09:51.057
with your annoyingly perfect
Hope Mikaelson heroics

09:51.057 --> 09:52.392
when we need you the most.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.341
She's right, for a change.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.978
It's hero time, Hope.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.346
GUARD:
I said keep it down in there.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.948
(dart gun whooshes,
guard grunts)

10:17.083 --> 10:18.284
Did someone say "hero time"?

10:21.354 --> 10:23.423
I found it.
So let's get out of here.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.865
Not much of an indestructible
artifact, is it?

10:31.865 --> 10:34.767
This was a test to see if
you were really on my side.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.436
Which I'm obviously not.
You're a good liar,

10:36.436 --> 10:38.271
Landon, but you're not great.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.240
I knew you didn't
recognize the chalice,

10:40.240 --> 10:43.309
but I figured it'd be fun to see
how far you could take this.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.144
While we're telling the truth,

10:45.144 --> 10:47.180
I'm never helping you
find the artifact,

10:47.180 --> 10:48.414
whatever the hell it is.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.251
I'm guessing you already did.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.253
When you took
the knife

10:53.253 --> 10:55.054
and the urn,
did you even realize

10:55.054 --> 10:56.456
what you were doing at the time,

10:56.456 --> 10:59.526
or was it
unconscious?

10:59.526 --> 11:01.861
Check your pocket.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.863
Let's find out.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.411
Crap.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.281
A blood fountain? Gross.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.349
MG: It's even grosser
in person. Trust me.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.118
I was looking for a way
to shut it off,

11:25.118 --> 11:26.953
but I couldn't figure out how.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.088
All right, I'll go find
the secret tunnel, I guess.

11:29.088 --> 11:32.025
Thanks. We get our magic back,
we'll have the upper hand.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.093
And then I can siphon
the sludge out of Josie,

11:34.093 --> 11:35.862
not that she'll appreciate it.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.031
Great, then I'll
just be shot.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.099
See? The new you is so snarky.

11:40.099 --> 11:42.302
Okay. I'm gonna be back
as soon as I can.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.870
Please keep these two
from trying to kill

11:43.870 --> 11:44.871
or die for each other.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.372
You need to go help Landon.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.774
We don't need you to be here.

11:47.774 --> 11:48.841
But I can't leave you guys here.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.243
For the love of Frodo,

11:50.243 --> 11:52.779
go rescue your Hobbit.
We'll muddle through.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.249
She's right again.
He needs you.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.850
We've been watching
you save the day

11:57.850 --> 11:59.519
this entire school
year, Hope. We got it.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.287
Now go save Landon.
JOSIE: Go.

12:01.287 --> 12:05.191
If you go soft on us now,
I'm just gonna hurl Maligoo.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.464
Y'all need to stay out of sight
until we get the magic back

12:11.464 --> 12:13.233
and you can throw down
with the rest of us.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.467
In the meantime,

12:14.467 --> 12:16.202
I'll rally up the troops.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.072
Everything's gonna be okay, Jo.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.407
MG, wait.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.243
I have an idea.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.982
Take this. You know
what to do with it.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.093
Uh, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.361
Well, I'm taking
a load off

12:41.361 --> 12:43.029
in the chair Lincoln
was killed in.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.498
The guards here say they see
his ghost sometimes.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.234
Are you insane? I just
activated the last artifact,

12:48.234 --> 12:50.370
which means that a monster
is no doubt barreling

12:50.370 --> 12:51.904
its claw-footed way here
as we speak.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.906
Oh, I'm counting on it.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.975
And when it arrives,
we're gonna give it this.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.176
That whole Triad
facility will be

12:57.176 --> 12:59.012
on high alert,
so either you and I

12:59.012 --> 13:01.114
fight our way through an army
to toss this thing

13:01.114 --> 13:03.383
in the pit,
or let the monster do it for us.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.254
We're looking
for a chalice.

13:08.254 --> 13:11.924
See, none of this is a chalice.
Hey!

13:11.924 --> 13:14.494
What was he doing out there?

13:14.494 --> 13:16.362
Chill, man.
I was just

13:16.362 --> 13:18.064
looking for your
unholy grail.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.233
Except you've come back
empty-handed.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.935
Go wait with the others.
You're as useless as they are.

13:22.935 --> 13:24.070
I'm sorry.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.205
You're very strong, by the way.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.875
Yo.
Whoa.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.810
You got back just in time.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.146
Ugly Triad dude's about to go
Full Metal Jacket.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.947
MG:
I know what's messing
with our magic,

13:34.947 --> 13:37.383
and Hope's gonna shut it down,

13:37.383 --> 13:39.519
and when
that happens,

13:39.519 --> 13:41.487
we get our juice back,
that'll be the time

13:41.487 --> 13:44.023
to make our move.
What move, exactly?

13:44.023 --> 13:45.358
You remember your opening play

13:45.358 --> 13:47.026
from the Wickery
championship game last year?

13:47.026 --> 13:48.861
Oh, yeah.
All right, then.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.230
So spread the word.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.365
On my signal.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.001
All right, let's get it done.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.369
LANDON:
You got what you wanted.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.404
Why do you
still need me?

13:58.404 --> 14:01.374
I don't need you. Daddy does.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.309
You're the
golden child.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.178
The one he was trying
to create, remember?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.779
The perfect son.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.314
The one who could create
the new bloodline.

14:08.314 --> 14:11.350
Because of you, he'll be able
to launch the species.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.919
I'm 17.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.353
I'm not interested
in, like,

14:14.353 --> 14:15.822
procreating or whatever, okay?

14:15.822 --> 14:17.256
Especially if it means
I'm spawning

14:17.256 --> 14:18.925
an army of evil minions.

14:18.925 --> 14:20.960
Oh, didn't I mention?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.328
You're just the host.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.231
The what?

14:27.133 --> 14:29.936
The host.
Biologically speaking,

14:29.936 --> 14:32.405
you're the living organism...
I know what a host is!

14:32.405 --> 14:34.240
I've seen Invasion
of the Body Snatchers.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.410
Are you kidding me?
Tell me you're

14:37.410 --> 14:39.378
pulling some kind of lame
brotherly prank right now.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.481
You wanted to be special, right?

14:41.481 --> 14:43.349
The foster kid
looking for a family,

14:43.349 --> 14:46.385
believing that you had a purpose
if only you could find it.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.221
Turns out
your purpose

14:48.221 --> 14:50.990
is to be a meat suit
for the most powerful monster

14:50.990 --> 14:52.291
ever to walk the earth.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.229
Well, probably sounds
worse than it is.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.231
(distant shrieking)

14:58.231 --> 15:00.133
That must be our new friend.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.902
What do you think it'll be?
Centaur? Pegasus?

15:13.813 --> 15:16.783
(neighing, shrieking)

15:16.783 --> 15:18.184
Even better.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.927
It's all yours.
Just do your thing.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.809
(grunting)

15:50.082 --> 15:51.751
Dick move, brother.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.799
I don't suppose you come
with an instruction manual.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.439
I told you to wait for me.
In a shocking

16:13.439 --> 16:14.740
turn of events, I ignored you.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.108
Yeah, Hope, about that...
Save the speech.

16:16.108 --> 16:17.476
Okay? I've paid the price.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.978
I see that.
What happened to your arm?

16:21.714 --> 16:24.050
That Triad guy shot at us
with Malivore mud.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.985
He must have
gotten me, too.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.053
I-I didn't even feel it.

16:29.455 --> 16:30.923
Because it doesn't affect me.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.525
Wait, who else got shot?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.660
Dr. Saltzman,
you have to trust me.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.596
Josie's gonna be just...
Josie got shot?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.064
Yes, but MG and
Lizzie are on it,

16:38.064 --> 16:40.166
and I think that they
can fix everything.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.468
If I can just figure out a way
to turn this stupid thing off,

16:42.468 --> 16:43.870
then they can
get their magic back.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.946
Which is super easy,
apparently.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.882
How did you know how to do that?

16:55.882 --> 16:58.651
This is a dark object,

16:58.651 --> 17:01.020
created by a group
of extinct witch-like people

17:01.020 --> 17:02.421
called the Travelers.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.891
Anti-magic was kind of
their thing.

17:04.891 --> 17:07.126
How did Triad
even get it in here?

17:07.126 --> 17:09.896
How did they know that
there were tunnels?

17:09.896 --> 17:11.631
Listen, I will explain
everything to you later, okay?

17:11.631 --> 17:13.099
But right now,
I have to get to Josie.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.301
Wait.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.704
Give her a vial of my blood.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.373
From the werewolf bite cures.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.041
Why?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.876
I'll explain later, too.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.116
It's not working.

17:30.116 --> 17:32.118
Why isn't it working?

17:32.118 --> 17:34.020
Maybe it can't
be siphoned.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.655
But then you'll die.

17:35.655 --> 17:39.325
That's one way for you
to avoid the Merge.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.596
Cheater.
No.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.999
Uh-uh. You do not get
to be the martyr.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.734
That was my job.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.038
I'm obviously better
at that, too.

17:52.038 --> 17:55.474
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

17:55.474 --> 17:57.777
I'm the broken one.

17:57.777 --> 18:02.481
Just think of the amazing outfit
that you'll wear to my funeral.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.884
(chuckles)

18:09.088 --> 18:11.991
I'm sorry I was so awful.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.126
I'm sorrier.

18:14.126 --> 18:15.995
Stop competing with me.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.431
And help me up.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.901
MG needs us.
Blaze of glory, right?

18:37.883 --> 18:40.119
You sure you're up for this?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.888
Not at all.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.324
But if you're fighting,
I'm fighting, too.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.861
What's the bling for?

18:50.596 --> 18:52.665
Making quiet things heard.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.403
Salvatore Stallions! Let's ride!

18:57.403 --> 18:59.138
(cheering)
Pedro, now.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.806
(grunting)

19:00.806 --> 19:02.408
Jed.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.545
Jed, I'm open!

19:07.580 --> 19:10.016
(chanting in foreign language)

19:10.016 --> 19:11.884
(coughing)

19:11.884 --> 19:14.020
♪ I'm invincible... ♪

19:15.988 --> 19:17.556
(screaming)

19:17.556 --> 19:19.959
Kaleb, get the kids to the bus.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.695
Witches...

19:25.031 --> 19:26.432
...make it rain.

19:26.432 --> 19:27.299
(all shouting)

19:31.370 --> 19:32.972
Their magic's back.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.374
Somebody get to the
tunnels and fix this!

19:39.378 --> 19:40.613
Don't move.

19:50.589 --> 19:51.891
Nice job,
little man.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.793
Come here. Hold on tight.

20:00.066 --> 20:03.936
So you think you're
a superhero or something?

20:03.936 --> 20:06.505
Honestly? Kind of.

20:06.505 --> 20:08.507
Too bad I got Kryptonite.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.481
Too bad I got Super Friends.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.693
RAFAEL:
All right, Jo,

20:27.693 --> 20:28.894
you don't look too hot.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.629
We got to go after Burr.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.631
RAFAEL:
Don't worry.

20:32.631 --> 20:33.799
(sniffles)

20:33.799 --> 20:35.901
I got magical Hope bling, too.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.104
If Josie and Lizzie can
help me with a veiling spell...

20:39.505 --> 20:40.940
...he'll never see me coming.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.546
Right up, up there.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.115
All right.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.583
You guys okay?

20:50.583 --> 20:51.917
All right, all right, all right.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.085
All right.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.220
Here you go, little man.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.588
Sit tight, okay?

20:55.588 --> 20:56.922
(gun clicks)

20:59.091 --> 21:01.060
(scoffs)
Look around, man.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.129
Your stupid cup
ain't here, okay?

21:03.129 --> 21:04.630
You lost.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.866
No. Look how much
you can still lose.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.545
(horse neighs)

21:23.449 --> 21:25.718
Come on, man, please.
My daughter's injured.

21:25.718 --> 21:26.986
She needs me.
Just let me get to her.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.121
Turn around.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.190
(door opens)

21:31.190 --> 21:33.926
Great. Now it's a party.
Hands behind your back.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.195
Okay. Take it easy.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.336
Yes! You're definitely
getting a raise.

21:44.336 --> 21:45.871
With dental.

21:47.273 --> 21:48.674
Hey.

21:48.674 --> 21:49.775
Listen to me, don't...

21:49.775 --> 21:50.876
You don't want to do this, okay?

21:50.876 --> 21:52.745
Point the gun at me.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.647
(growling, people shouting)

21:57.950 --> 21:59.084
What the hell?

22:04.690 --> 22:06.992
I got it from here, Raf.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.830
Hit the woods
until Hope comes back.

22:11.830 --> 22:12.998
(Rafael panting)

22:15.234 --> 22:17.403
You're a monster,
just like him,

22:17.403 --> 22:19.772
and you all need to be put down.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.184
NIA:
Rather be a monster

22:32.184 --> 22:33.385
than a paperweight.

22:33.385 --> 22:35.154
I thought you were long gone.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.723
Would John Stewart leave
the Corps hanging?

22:37.723 --> 22:39.058
(shouting in distance)

22:39.058 --> 22:41.193
Hell no.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.596
'Cause he's the best Green
Lantern, and you know it.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.733
Stay in touch, cutie.

22:49.268 --> 22:52.004
Okay.

22:54.406 --> 22:55.941
(wind whooshing)

22:58.911 --> 23:00.346
Daddy, this is so bad.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.684
(echoing):
Josie...

23:08.754 --> 23:10.089
Josie, Josie, drink this now.

23:25.271 --> 23:28.574
KALEB:
They say revolution is messy.

23:33.045 --> 23:35.314
And I'm okay with that.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.983
You don't need to do that.
It's over.

23:37.983 --> 23:40.386
If we don't use him
to send Triad a message,

23:40.386 --> 23:42.388
who's to say they won't send
someone worse next time?

23:42.388 --> 23:44.890
These Triad guys are
just scared bullies,

23:44.890 --> 23:46.859
lashing out because they think
they're losing control

23:46.859 --> 23:49.161
over something they had no
power over in the first place.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.397
Like you told me once,

23:51.397 --> 23:54.400
we're faster, we're stronger,
we're better.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.335
Deep down, they know that.

23:56.335 --> 23:58.304
So just be better.

24:00.406 --> 24:03.208
We don't need to prove it
by killing them.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.218
Look at you, man.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.823
Baby's all grown up.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.376
I am so sorry.

24:37.376 --> 24:39.044
We were misled.

24:39.044 --> 24:41.280
The artifact was never here.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.148
(sighs)

24:43.148 --> 24:45.718
And Burr, he...
he took it too far.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.720
Pointing guns at children.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.255
He'll never work
in the field again.

24:50.255 --> 24:53.425
If that's supposed to be
an apology, it sucks.

24:53.425 --> 24:55.861
How could you work
with guys like that?

24:55.861 --> 24:57.796
Triad is my father's legacy.

24:57.796 --> 24:59.331
And his father before him.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.300
And it was meant to be
yours, too, until...

25:01.300 --> 25:03.335
Until I became one
of the monsters you guys hate.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.374
Triad has been doing
great work in the world.

25:08.374 --> 25:12.111
If this
is our family's legacy...

25:14.680 --> 25:17.950
...we cannot be family anymore.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.824
(screeching)

25:26.992 --> 25:29.361
Look, hear me out.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.562
You can hear, right?

25:32.731 --> 25:33.999
Uh...

25:33.999 --> 25:36.268
Uh, man-to-man,

Ow! Ow, how do you even do that
without your seeing-eye horse?

25:45.644 --> 25:47.613
Or is it more
of an emotional support horse?

25:50.416 --> 25:52.584
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, please, please, don't!

26:02.428 --> 26:04.263
Hope.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.542
I knew you'd find me.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.477

you left in that voice mail.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.279

26:34.326 --> 26:37.563

already, and the world.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.565
Yeah, she's pretty good at that.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.433
Hopefully she gets back soon.

were mine.

28:05.751 --> 28:09.555
A contingency plan
that I had developed

it was the world that would need

...I love you.

Okay, well,
tell me where you are.

34:28.366 --> 34:30.235
Fort Valley, Georgia.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.737
Landon's gonna need you when I'm
done. You have to write it down.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.307
Wait. You're at
Triad Headquarters?
HOPE: Yeah.

34:35.307 --> 34:37.542
Uh, don't worry, though.
Everyone here is dead.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.077
Okay, listen,
you're not making any sense.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.378
Just put Landon on the phone.

34:40.378 --> 34:41.813
I can't.
Uh, he would have tried

34:41.813 --> 34:44.316
to stop me,
so I had to kill him, too.

34:44.316 --> 34:45.550
What?

34:45.550 --> 34:46.952
He'll come back. Don't worry.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.220
Even if I don't.

34:49.220 --> 34:50.689
Hope,

34:50.689 --> 34:52.223
tell me what the hell
you're about

34:52.223 --> 34:53.692
to do right now
before you do it.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.328
Clarke won.
He found the final artifact,

34:56.328 --> 34:58.897
and he tossed it into the pit,
which is Landon's father,

34:58.897 --> 35:00.699
by the way.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.901
And now Malivore's gonna rise
unless I stop him.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.436
Stop him how?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.304
Landon got all the answers, but,

35:06.304 --> 35:09.240
basically, Malivore was created
by the blood of a werewolf,

35:09.240 --> 35:11.276
a witch and a vampire.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.912
It used to be that only they
could destroy what they created,

35:13.912 --> 35:15.447
but nature found a loophole.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.183
By making me.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.819
The Tribrid. I'm the loophole.
Hope, you listen to me.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.520
Now, this is a theory, okay,
and you don't even know

35:22.520 --> 35:24.522
if this is gonna work,
so you just sit tight,

35:24.522 --> 35:26.191
and you wait
for me to get there.

35:26.191 --> 35:27.726
There's no time.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.461
I've always thought
that I was a cosmic mistake,

35:29.461 --> 35:31.296
someone who should never
have been born.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.799
But after all this time, I mean,
my purpose is finally clear.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.468
Think about it.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.703
I'm the answer to all of this.

35:38.703 --> 35:42.540
I can remember things about
Malivore that no one else can.

35:42.540 --> 35:44.676
That Triad weapon
didn't affect me.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.344
Did my blood heal Josie?

35:46.344 --> 35:47.679
I am not okay with this.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.481
I know.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.716
But you will be, because once
I toss myself into that pit,

35:51.716 --> 35:53.218
no one at school
will remember me.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.555
Including you.

35:57.555 --> 35:59.557
Hope. You listen to me.

35:59.557 --> 36:01.426
I've spent years
torturing myself,

36:01.426 --> 36:05.363
asking myself why my father
sacrificed himself for me,

36:05.363 --> 36:07.665
to get to this point where,

36:07.665 --> 36:11.302
I mean, I totally understand it.

36:11.302 --> 36:12.937
And I don't want you to have to

36:12.937 --> 36:14.439
go through that pain,
Dr. Saltzman.

36:14.439 --> 36:15.640
You've been through enough.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.177
And I don't want anyone
at school to miss me,

36:19.177 --> 36:21.713
because they're my friends.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.448
Maybe I would have
seen that sooner

36:23.448 --> 36:25.683
if I hadn't been beating
myself up all this time.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.185
(sighs)

36:28.253 --> 36:29.554
This is where you tell me

36:29.554 --> 36:31.256
that even though
you wish you could

36:31.256 --> 36:34.325
change my mind, you know
I'm doing the right thing.

36:39.431 --> 36:42.534
This is the part where
you tell me you're proud of me.

36:42.534 --> 36:43.935
(sighs)

36:43.935 --> 36:46.271
(voice breaking):
You know I'm proud of you.

36:46.271 --> 36:47.672
You know it.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.678
What is it you need me to do?

36:53.678 --> 36:55.413
Call maintenance.

36:55.413 --> 36:57.215
Have 'em pack up my room.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.317
Take my files,

36:59.317 --> 37:01.753
all those notes
I know that you keep about me,

37:01.753 --> 37:03.421
and burn them.

37:03.421 --> 37:05.457
Along with Landon's journal.

37:05.457 --> 37:07.559
Listen, if you want
to erase yourself,

37:07.559 --> 37:11.429
that is on you, okay, but
you can't ask me to do it, too.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.300
I'm sorry, Dr. Saltzman.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.371
But I trust you more
than I trust anyone.

37:20.371 --> 37:23.108
I wish I would have
figured that out sooner, too.

37:24.776 --> 37:27.645
(whooshing, roaring)

37:27.645 --> 37:29.647
I got to go.

37:29.647 --> 37:30.815
Hope,

37:30.815 --> 37:32.250
listen to me. Wait.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.651
Not an option. Uh-uh.

37:33.651 --> 37:35.520
Uh, promise me
you're gonna do what I said.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.559
Promise me.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.264
All right. Fine.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.333
I promise.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.401
(sniffles, sighs)

38:06.985 --> 38:09.888
(bones snap)
Ooh. Sorry.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.523
I was eavesdropping.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.491
What are you waiting for?

38:13.491 --> 38:17.028
I assumed you were gonna try
to stop me.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.229
Hell no.

38:18.229 --> 38:19.531
I was only trying
to raise my father

38:19.531 --> 38:20.865
because I'm terrified of him,

38:20.865 --> 38:23.434
and I knew
he'd find a way out someday.

38:23.434 --> 38:26.437
But if you're right about
this loophole-- can actually

38:26.437 --> 38:29.474
kill the bastard
once and for all--

38:29.474 --> 38:31.976
be my guest.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.611
And if you're wrong,

38:33.611 --> 38:36.347
well, no harm done
because you'll be dead.

38:36.347 --> 38:38.550
So go on.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.018
I'll be rooting for you.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.853
That's not all you'll be doing.

38:41.853 --> 38:44.756
Imitantor Pupulus.

38:46.691 --> 38:48.693
Whatever you think you just did

38:48.693 --> 38:50.495
didn't work.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.600
How'd you do that?

38:55.600 --> 38:57.635
Why did I do that?

38:57.635 --> 38:59.137
It's a basic mimic spell.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.839
We learned it in second grade.

39:02.607 --> 39:04.442
Also in second grade...

39:05.643 --> 39:07.579
(groans softly)

39:08.913 --> 39:10.915
Follow the Leader.

39:10.915 --> 39:13.318
You don't have to do this.
I know.

39:13.318 --> 39:16.921
But it's the only part
I'm actually enjoying.

39:20.391 --> 39:22.260
Too bad you're so clumsy.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.747
(wolf howling)

39:57.362 --> 39:59.097
(gasps)

39:59.097 --> 40:00.732
You okay?
