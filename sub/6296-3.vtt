01:42.952 --> 01:45.721
His Eminence,
Cardinal Della Rovere,

01:45.788 --> 01:50.325
begs an introduction to His Royal
Highness King Ferrante of Naples,

01:50.392 --> 01:54.362
and His Highness' son,
Prince Alfonso.

01:54.430 --> 01:58.699
Your Royal Highness,
good Prince.

02:13.248 --> 02:15.415
He can't hear you.

02:15.483 --> 02:19.353
He's deaf as a post.
Has been for years.

02:23.258 --> 02:27.895
The cardinal has come to discuss the
deposition of the Borgia pope, Father.

02:27.963 --> 02:32.700
You remember Borgia?
The ambitious Spaniard.

02:36.071 --> 02:38.772
He has appointed a veritable
cascade of cardinals...

02:38.839 --> 02:40.774
can one say a cascade
of cardinals?

02:40.841 --> 02:43.710
Like a gaggle of geese?
A clutter of cats?

02:43.778 --> 02:46.647
An army of ants?
Why not?

02:46.714 --> 02:49.583
He has appointed a veritable
cascade of cardinals.

02:49.651 --> 02:52.553
Among them his son.

02:52.620 --> 02:56.423
His son.

02:56.491 --> 02:59.393
Cesare Borgia!
You remember him?

03:01.296 --> 03:03.763
See?

03:03.831 --> 03:05.899
He hears nothing.

03:07.868 --> 03:11.771
It seems the good
Cardinal Della Rovere has fled.

03:13.974 --> 03:16.475
Where to, I wonder?

03:16.543 --> 03:18.878
Wherever he can find an ally...

03:18.946 --> 03:21.981
Florence, Milan...

03:22.049 --> 03:24.517
I would hazard Naples.

03:26.420 --> 03:30.489
Dear old King Ferrante;
his hospitality is legendary.

03:30.557 --> 03:35.028
- You've heard about his dining room?
- I've heard the rumours.

03:35.096 --> 03:38.331
If Della Rovere thinks
Rome is a charnel house...

03:38.398 --> 03:43.068
The good cardinal imagines that
he alone hears the word of God.

03:43.136 --> 03:47.706
But God saw
what he was blind to.

03:47.774 --> 03:51.944
What the Holy Church needs
at this juncture is someone

03:52.011 --> 03:55.080
who can ensure its survival...

03:55.148 --> 03:58.817
...by whatever means
necessary.

04:03.923 --> 04:06.191
You have someone who...

04:06.259 --> 04:09.294
...can wield a good garrote,
do you not?

04:11.731 --> 04:14.165
Has it been rumoured that I do?

04:14.233 --> 04:18.502
It has been whispered.

04:20.338 --> 04:22.206
And if I did?

04:22.274 --> 04:25.143
Maybe it is time

04:25.210 --> 04:28.345
for the good cardinal's collar
to be replaced.

04:30.249 --> 04:32.250
Replaced?

04:32.317 --> 04:37.922
With what does one replace
an ecclesiastical collar?

04:37.990 --> 04:42.193
My memory fails me.

04:42.261 --> 04:45.696
I think I understand you,
Father.

04:45.764 --> 04:47.964
Good.

04:50.735 --> 04:55.272
Sometimes, one barely
understands oneself.

04:55.340 --> 04:57.641
Want, want, want.

04:57.709 --> 04:59.976
Everybody wants.

05:00.044 --> 05:02.879
France wants Naples.
Spain wants Naples.

05:02.947 --> 05:05.683
The whole of Christendom wants
the New World.

05:05.750 --> 05:10.120
And you, dear Cardinal,
what do you want?

05:10.188 --> 05:13.890
I merely want Naples
to join in alliance with me

05:13.958 --> 05:17.528
- to rid the papacy...
- Of the stench of Borgia.

05:17.595 --> 05:21.364
Mm-hmm.
In return for?

05:23.334 --> 05:26.303
A worthy inhabitant
of the chair of St. Peter's

05:26.370 --> 05:30.240
would see the justice of the
independent claims of Naples.

05:30.308 --> 05:33.043
Naples is already
independent, Cardinal.

05:33.110 --> 05:38.114
- Spain would beg to disagree.
- Ah.

05:38.182 --> 05:40.283
An adversary.

05:44.922 --> 05:49.192
Shall we show him, Father, how it pleased
you to deal with your adversaries?

05:49.260 --> 05:50.927
Hmm?

05:50.995 --> 05:53.162
When you were
in your magnificent prime?

05:53.230 --> 05:55.464
You see, he does remember.

05:55.531 --> 05:58.033
What does he remember?

05:58.101 --> 06:00.236
I am at a loss to say.

06:05.141 --> 06:07.609
He remembers cruelty.

06:18.287 --> 06:21.489
Have you commissioned
your portrait yet, brother?

06:21.556 --> 06:25.960
- I see no need.
- Ah, humility.

06:26.028 --> 06:28.329
As befits the cleric.

06:28.397 --> 06:32.233
But the public might demand
such a display from a soldier.

06:32.301 --> 06:36.204
Poor Pinturicchio's going
to run out of paint.

06:36.272 --> 06:38.973
And we must pay
for this extravagance!

06:39.041 --> 06:42.476
- Have the abbeys all been emptied?
- There is never enough.

06:42.544 --> 06:47.447
Queen Isabella has rather
precipitously expelled

06:47.515 --> 06:50.050
all the Jews from Spain...

06:50.118 --> 06:52.119
the Murranos,

06:52.186 --> 06:54.154
as they once dared to call us.

06:54.222 --> 06:58.525
- They still insult us thus.
- Well, I can assure you, my dear son,

06:58.592 --> 07:02.462
there's not one drop
of Jewish blood in you.

07:02.530 --> 07:07.234
But as a stranger
in a foreign land myself,

07:07.302 --> 07:10.537
I... sympathize
with their plight.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.572
"The chosen people."

07:12.640 --> 07:15.208
Once more
in search of a home.

07:15.276 --> 07:17.710
They clamour
to get into our state.

07:17.778 --> 07:21.647
And they offer
to pay... handsomely.

07:21.714 --> 07:24.850
There will be objections.

07:24.918 --> 07:27.686
Well, there always are.

07:27.754 --> 07:31.890
But I want my papacy to be like
Joseph's coat of many colours.

07:31.959 --> 07:38.230
And Jesus Christ, our Saviour,
was, after all, a Jew.

07:38.298 --> 07:41.567
He was also killed
by Jews, Father.

07:41.634 --> 07:43.970
Are you sure?

07:44.037 --> 07:47.273
I thought
he was crucified by Romans.

07:53.079 --> 07:57.015
My father had
many adversaries, Cardinal.

07:57.083 --> 07:59.951
But all of them came
to sing his praises.

08:00.019 --> 08:03.888
And when they could sing
no more...

08:03.956 --> 08:07.492
...he had them stuffed!

08:24.075 --> 08:26.343
You see, he liked to dine,
when his health was still good,

08:26.411 --> 08:29.480
with those who considered
displeasing him.

08:33.418 --> 08:35.919
He's yet to find his Judas.

08:40.525 --> 08:46.363
So, you think that a pope has
earned a place at this table.

08:46.431 --> 08:51.701
My intentions were not quite so...
severe, Your Highness.

08:51.769 --> 08:53.637
Why not?

08:53.704 --> 08:56.140
They would happily
seat you there.

08:56.207 --> 08:59.375
These Borgias are
Murranos... Spanish Jews.

08:59.443 --> 09:01.044
They have no scruples.

09:01.111 --> 09:04.347
You do them a disservice,
if that's possible.

09:04.415 --> 09:07.717
Scruples, they may have none.

09:07.785 --> 09:12.656
Jewish blood,
they have even less of.

09:12.723 --> 09:15.859
- You're sure?
- Mm-hmm.

09:15.927 --> 09:19.663
Perhaps then
they deserve the papacy.

09:25.036 --> 09:28.972
I will discuss your proposals
with my father's advisers.

09:30.907 --> 09:33.709
I'd be delighted if you'd accept
our hospitality tomorrow.

09:33.777 --> 09:38.213
One of our sulphur baths.

09:38.281 --> 09:41.550
It might improve
Your Eminence's temper. Hmm?

09:41.618 --> 09:43.485
Good for the skin.

09:48.458 --> 09:51.794
Tomorrow, Cardinal.
Tomorrow.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.583
See they are installed
in my mother's villa.

10:04.650 --> 10:07.719
Whatever one could say
about the cardinal's politics,

10:07.787 --> 10:09.754
there is no questioning
his good taste.

10:09.822 --> 10:12.223
He has arrived
in Naples, my lord.

10:14.126 --> 10:15.727
Hold it up!

10:15.795 --> 10:19.163
My father had a quaint turn
of phrase: he expressed a wish

10:19.231 --> 10:21.666
that the cardinal's collar might
be replaced.

10:21.734 --> 10:27.538
If he was to see my face,
he would flee the city.

10:27.607 --> 10:30.475
Well, stay
in the shadows, then.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.310
Isn't that
where you are happiest?

10:36.247 --> 10:41.184
I am embarrassed to admit
I've never seen a garrote.

10:41.252 --> 10:43.553
It is just a cheese cutter,
my lord.

10:43.622 --> 10:45.656
You must show me.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.616
One almost feels pity
for the melon.

11:20.190 --> 11:23.492
My father deems Leonardo
too expensive.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.496
And, my lord,
he rarely finishes.

11:27.564 --> 11:30.599
He would have finished for me.

11:30.668 --> 11:32.835
But we will show that Milanese
mirror painter

11:32.903 --> 11:36.806
what true highlights
should look like.

11:36.874 --> 11:38.808
Raise it.

11:38.876 --> 11:41.409
Till the armour glitters.

12:00.863 --> 12:03.932
Come!

13:39.059 --> 13:41.695
You're on.

14:03.149 --> 14:05.184
My beloved son.

14:06.986 --> 14:09.322
Father.

14:12.759 --> 14:16.362
Crimson is a colour
that suits you.

14:18.765 --> 14:21.133
Thank you.

14:21.201 --> 14:24.603
But you regard this elevation
as a burden.

14:28.742 --> 14:32.645
You will be made cardinal
tomorrow.

14:32.713 --> 14:35.347
And you must beware that sin
St. Isidore calls

14:35.414 --> 14:39.517
the greatest of all,
which only the pope can forgive.

14:39.585 --> 14:42.387
I believe
it is called despair, Father.

14:42.455 --> 14:46.791
You must never, ever despair.

14:49.795 --> 14:51.864
Embrace me, Cesare.

14:55.601 --> 14:58.770
Forgive my ambitions for you.

14:58.838 --> 15:02.674
But they have been such
since the day you were born.

15:04.577 --> 15:06.677
Had I not embraced a career
in the church,

15:06.745 --> 15:09.113
then perhaps things would have
been different.

15:11.416 --> 15:14.685
You are my eldest son.

15:14.753 --> 15:18.489
It is your destiny
to follow in my footsteps.

15:20.359 --> 15:23.261
Tell me you accept this calling.

15:28.133 --> 15:30.001
I accept.

15:50.554 --> 15:53.189
The sensual delights
of our Neapolitan Kingdom have

15:53.257 --> 15:55.491
attracted many invaders,
Cardinal.

15:55.559 --> 15:59.930
When you have a paradise, you must use
every means available to defend it.

15:59.997 --> 16:03.166
My father has grown feeble
with the effort.

16:03.234 --> 16:04.667
King Ferrante.

16:04.735 --> 16:07.404
Mmm. I spoke with his advisers
of your request.

16:07.471 --> 16:10.906
- And?
- Yes. They will consider it.

16:10.974 --> 16:14.276
He will meet his maker soon,
and he would confess,

16:14.344 --> 16:16.611
if he can manage the words,
to a pope before he dies.

16:16.679 --> 16:18.647
And we would rather
it be a Christian one.

16:22.919 --> 16:24.987
Enough!

16:30.327 --> 16:34.196
Immerse yourself, Cardinal.

16:34.264 --> 16:39.134
The sulphur waters renew
the flesh, soothe the spirit.

16:39.202 --> 16:41.570
We will all of us be dead,
soon enough.

16:41.637 --> 16:43.772
I will, with your permission.

16:45.741 --> 16:47.275
Thank you.

17:15.269 --> 17:18.070
- Cover me fully.
- As you wish.

17:22.042 --> 17:25.980
♪

18:56.802 --> 19:03.040
It is red, as a sign of the
dignity of the order of cardinals,

19:03.109 --> 19:09.046
signifying that you are ready
to act with fortitude.

19:09.115 --> 19:15.419
Red, as a sign that you are
willing to spill your blood

19:15.487 --> 19:19.022
for the increase
of the Christian faith,

19:19.090 --> 19:24.361
into which you have all been
baptized.

19:24.429 --> 19:29.966
<i>Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus,</i>

19:30.034 --> 19:31.701
<i>Pater,</i>

19:31.769 --> 19:35.239
<i>et Filius,</i>

19:35.306 --> 19:38.642
<i>et Spiritus Sanctus.</i>

19:38.709 --> 19:41.411
Guards! An assassin!

19:41.479 --> 19:44.648
That man there
with the scarred back!

19:44.715 --> 19:47.917
For God's sake,
arrest him!

19:47.985 --> 19:50.020
Stop!

20:31.895 --> 20:35.898
Arise,
our brother cardinals.

20:49.613 --> 20:52.480
- Who is he?
- Everyone out!

20:52.548 --> 20:53.982
I can't see!

20:56.586 --> 20:58.386
Stop him!

20:58.454 --> 21:00.522
<i>Benedetto!</i>

21:00.590 --> 21:03.558
<i>Assassino!</i>

21:03.626 --> 21:07.596
You leave carnage in your
wake, Cardinal! Absolute carnage!

21:07.663 --> 21:10.999
We have no need of carnage!
We have no need of carnage!

21:11.067 --> 21:13.102
You should leave Naples
forthwith

21:13.169 --> 21:15.170
unless you want a place
at my father's table

21:15.238 --> 21:16.805
on a more permanent basis!

21:22.693 --> 21:24.805
So you failed.

21:26.630 --> 21:29.132
Is that a first?

21:29.200 --> 21:33.336
Success in these matters is
never a given, my lord.

21:33.404 --> 21:38.208
Should I forfeit my trust
in you, then?

21:38.275 --> 21:40.510
It was a public baths, my lord.

21:40.578 --> 21:43.146
I am Your Eminence now.

21:43.214 --> 21:45.415
Have you not noticed?

21:45.483 --> 21:48.117
Your Eminence,
it was a public baths.

21:48.184 --> 21:52.121
I disguised my face, but it was the
wounds on my back that betrayed me.

21:52.188 --> 21:58.327
Ah. Goodness and probity make
worthy adversaries, do they not?

21:58.394 --> 22:01.963
This cardinal seems immune
to corruption.

22:02.031 --> 22:04.899
We should have him followed,
then.

22:04.967 --> 22:07.136
By someone other than you.

22:07.203 --> 22:10.539
Everything can be arranged,
Your Eminence.

22:10.607 --> 22:16.011
But no more cheese cutting...
for the time, at least.

22:16.078 --> 22:19.381
And no more scandal.

22:19.449 --> 22:22.184
Juan requested Leonardo.

22:22.252 --> 22:26.354
And you wisely declined.

22:26.421 --> 22:31.092
We have not yet acquired
the wealth of a Florentine bank.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.161
Your Holiness.

22:37.232 --> 22:40.568
No, stay awhile.

22:40.636 --> 22:42.704
Please.

22:47.509 --> 22:51.880
We would have...
your advice on a matter.

22:51.947 --> 22:56.051
- Of state?
- Perhaps.

23:01.322 --> 23:03.590
The Sultan of Constantinople...

23:03.658 --> 23:05.859
...has requested

23:05.927 --> 23:08.628
that we welcome
his half-brother, Djem,

23:08.697 --> 23:12.265
- into our care.
- As hostage?

23:12.333 --> 23:14.367
Well, as foster.

23:14.435 --> 23:19.406
It would remove him as a threat
to the Ottoman succession.

23:19.473 --> 23:24.912
Now, he would pay us
40,000 ducats every year

23:24.979 --> 23:27.047
for the privilege.

23:27.115 --> 23:30.383
God knows, we need the cash.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.786
I would have your advice,
madame.

23:32.854 --> 23:35.755
He's a heathen.

23:35.823 --> 23:39.492
Well, he's a musselman.
He prays to Allah.

23:44.599 --> 23:47.066
You would invite heathens
to Rome?

23:47.134 --> 23:49.936
My father has invited
the Spanish Jews to Rome.

23:50.003 --> 23:54.241
- Yes.
- He wants to amaze the Christian world.

23:54.308 --> 24:00.113
He sees his papacy
as a coat of many colours.

24:00.180 --> 24:02.616
Well, we are all human,
are we not?

24:02.683 --> 24:05.585
Under the same God?

24:05.653 --> 24:10.723
Well, there are many who would
disagree with that thesis.

24:10.791 --> 24:14.927
But the pope is not
one of them.

24:14.995 --> 24:18.865
The great Sultan Bayezid II
presents his brother, Djem,

24:18.932 --> 24:22.334
to be Ambassador to the Court
of the Pope of Rome.

24:22.402 --> 24:25.905
He hopes his presence
and the great pope's protection

24:25.973 --> 24:28.707
will lead to concord
between their peoples,

24:28.776 --> 24:31.778
to a mutual treaty of protection
from their enemies.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.780
For 40,000 ducats per annum.

24:33.847 --> 24:38.117
Mohammed and your Jesus Christ
were brothers, after all.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.753
Why should we not be?

24:40.820 --> 24:43.489
Why not, indeed?

24:59.439 --> 25:01.506
A stag is easy pickings.

25:04.811 --> 25:08.246
Where I grew up
on the Persian foothills,

25:08.314 --> 25:10.648
the white tiger was our prey.

25:10.716 --> 25:12.417
Do tigers come in white?

25:12.484 --> 25:14.519
In all colours, my lady...
white,

25:14.586 --> 25:17.088
yellow, brown.

25:17.156 --> 25:20.525
- Why, I have even heard of tigers striped.
- Striped?

25:20.592 --> 25:24.395
- Never.
- I killed one with my bare hands.

25:24.463 --> 25:27.632
Have you seen a unicorn?

25:27.700 --> 25:31.502
- I have spoken with them.
- What language do they speak?

25:31.570 --> 25:33.904
It is in a meter
known only to Allah.

25:33.972 --> 25:36.808
Ah.

25:42.781 --> 25:45.583
I almost feel at home here,
my Christian brother.

25:45.651 --> 25:48.686
So many races,
so many faiths...

25:48.754 --> 25:52.389
so many costumes.
Where did they all come from?

25:52.457 --> 25:56.393
They're Murranos...
exiled Jews from Spain.

25:56.461 --> 25:59.730
Ah, and they are welcome here?

25:59.797 --> 26:01.898
My father the pope draws
no distinction,

26:01.966 --> 26:04.267
at least not where commerce
rears its pretty head.

26:04.335 --> 26:06.570
You mean they pay
for the privilege of being here?

26:06.637 --> 26:09.573
- No more than you do.
- Ah...

26:09.640 --> 26:11.975
But I am your guest, surely.

26:12.042 --> 26:15.178
My brother contributes towards
the expenses of my stay here,

26:15.246 --> 26:18.348
but the hospitality
you have shown me...

26:18.415 --> 26:20.350
no one could pay for that.

26:24.421 --> 26:27.090
She's growing, Rodrigo...

26:27.157 --> 26:31.527
- may I still call you Rodrigo?
- You may not, madame.

26:31.595 --> 26:34.197
What am I to call you, then,
father of my children?

26:34.265 --> 26:37.466
You know very well, Vanozza.

26:37.534 --> 26:41.537
She is growing, Your Holiness.

26:41.605 --> 26:45.474
And I imagine your presence here has
something to do with that fact.

26:45.542 --> 26:48.444
It does indeed.

26:48.512 --> 26:51.414
We can both be proud of her.

26:53.383 --> 26:55.284
We can, my dear.

26:55.351 --> 26:58.753
I am still your dear, then?

26:58.821 --> 27:01.990
Always.

27:02.058 --> 27:04.426
She must be married.

27:04.493 --> 27:07.729
I know she must.
But when?

27:07.797 --> 27:09.564
Soon.

27:09.632 --> 27:12.134
The vultures are circling
our family.

27:12.201 --> 27:15.503
Our Rome.

27:15.571 --> 27:18.606
We must protect ourselves.

27:18.674 --> 27:22.377
Must we marry her
to a vulture, then?

27:22.445 --> 27:24.846
We must marry her.

27:24.914 --> 27:27.115
Promise me one thing.

27:27.183 --> 27:31.018
- If I can.
- She can meet her betrothed

27:31.086 --> 27:35.089
before she is bartered like a golden calf.
We can give her that, at least.

27:39.462 --> 27:41.496
Have you heard the news, Djem?

27:41.564 --> 27:44.365
There is so much news
my little one.

27:44.433 --> 27:47.635
The news seems to change
by the hour in Rome.

27:47.703 --> 27:49.471
My news.

27:49.538 --> 27:51.906
You have news?

27:51.974 --> 27:55.209
I'm to be married.

27:55.277 --> 27:58.580
- Oh, my dear.
- Have you been married?

27:58.647 --> 28:00.815
I have taken four women
to wife.

28:00.883 --> 28:03.884
- Four? - Mm-hmm.
- Where are they now?

28:03.952 --> 28:06.987
In the seraglio of Topkaki
Palace, Constantinople.

28:07.054 --> 28:11.124
- How many wives can you have?
- As many as Allah sees fit to provide.

28:11.192 --> 28:14.862
As to concubines,
an infinite number.

28:14.929 --> 28:22.002
- What is the difference, Djem, between
wife and concubine? - No difference, really.

28:22.069 --> 28:24.838
Ah, you can beat a wife,
but not kill her.

28:24.906 --> 28:30.343
- You can kill a concubine?
- If she displeases you.

28:30.411 --> 28:34.313
You can kill a wife too, but
the displeasure must be grave.

28:37.250 --> 28:39.952
I will not be beaten, Djem.

28:40.020 --> 28:44.624
No.
You are the pope's daughter.

28:44.691 --> 28:47.827
You are the most beautiful
treasure this Vatican contains.

28:50.731 --> 28:53.098
If a husband tries to beat you,

28:53.166 --> 28:58.671
I, Djem, will strangle him
with my bare hands.

29:01.808 --> 29:05.411
- We are awash with suitors.
- Is this good news?

29:05.478 --> 29:08.413
Well, only four are
remotely suitable.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.115
So few?

29:11.183 --> 29:15.954
Every prince in Christendom
wants to make suit.

29:16.022 --> 29:18.723
But of the Italians...
and I think you'll agree,

29:18.791 --> 29:22.827
only an Italian makes
strategic sense...

29:22.895 --> 29:26.164
Colonna. Sforza.

29:26.231 --> 29:28.633
Medici.

29:28.701 --> 29:30.802
D'Este.

29:30.870 --> 29:34.038
- What of Alfonso of Naples?
- Oh...

29:34.106 --> 29:37.041
He would be ideal.

29:37.109 --> 29:42.547
But both France and Spain lay
claim to the Kingdom of Naples,

29:42.614 --> 29:46.717
and the might of each eclipses
that of all of Italy.

29:46.785 --> 29:51.655
We must keep those options
open... for now.

30:07.171 --> 30:10.140
Come on, Djem.

30:14.545 --> 30:17.114
It seems like
Juan has found a brother.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.251
Did he not already have one?

30:21.319 --> 30:24.554
Oh, indeed, but...
how should I put it?

30:24.622 --> 30:29.226
A brother in arms!

30:31.761 --> 30:33.695
Ah.

30:33.763 --> 30:35.231
Bravo!

30:35.298 --> 30:37.833
Do not worry,
my Christian brother.

30:37.900 --> 30:41.337
I would never do you harm.
I love you.

30:41.404 --> 30:44.140
- More, come on!
- Next time, Djem.

30:46.709 --> 30:50.045
- 40,000 ducats.
- If he lives.

30:50.113 --> 30:52.181
What?

30:52.249 --> 30:55.584
If he dies, and his body is
delivered to his brother,

30:55.652 --> 30:58.687
who hates and fears him,
400,000.

30:58.755 --> 31:00.222
You would never.

31:00.290 --> 31:02.624
No!
It would be unthinkable.

31:02.692 --> 31:05.527
We swore to be his protection.

31:05.594 --> 31:09.031
- I'm just telling you. The request was made.
- Good!

31:19.791 --> 31:23.927
Sforza. Borgia.

31:23.995 --> 31:27.697
If our families were to unite,

31:27.765 --> 31:30.267
central Italy would be secure,

31:30.335 --> 31:35.772
and our cousin,
Ludovico Sforza of Milan,

31:35.840 --> 31:38.942
has pledged to ally
with our interests.

31:50.488 --> 31:53.590
Your Holiness has requested
a meeting

31:53.658 --> 31:56.527
with Giovanni Sforza,
Lord of Pesaro.

31:56.594 --> 32:00.763
He will understand
how impossible that is,

32:00.830 --> 32:05.268
without an agreement
on a dowry.

32:07.171 --> 32:09.772
A dowry.

32:09.839 --> 32:11.574
But of course.

32:13.843 --> 32:16.779
The Sforza family needs
substantial funds

32:16.846 --> 32:21.551
to re-equip its armies
for the coming storm.

32:24.454 --> 32:29.192
My brother Meliaduse was
Abbot of Pomposa.

32:29.259 --> 32:33.229
His mother was a Medici,
you know. Yes,

32:33.297 --> 32:36.565
he died back in '52.

32:36.632 --> 32:40.268
But you'll remember my sister,
Ginevra?

32:40.336 --> 32:44.706
She married Pandolfo Malatesta
of Rimini.

32:44.773 --> 32:47.175
Or was that Lucrezia?

32:47.243 --> 32:51.846
Union with my nephew might
strengthen the boundless love

32:51.914 --> 32:55.783
between the families of Colonna

32:55.851 --> 33:00.188
and Borgia.

33:05.094 --> 33:08.863
There is no barrier
to his succession. The prince,

33:08.931 --> 33:12.533
his elder brother,
is confined to a madhouse.

33:15.169 --> 33:17.705
Perhaps it runs in the family.

33:19.974 --> 33:22.476
Our Venetian ships plow
the oceans

33:22.544 --> 33:26.547
from here to the Orient.
Rome could benefit from a navy

33:26.615 --> 33:29.015
off the coast of Ostia.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.852
Yes, but...

33:31.919 --> 33:33.854
...he is somewhat...

33:33.921 --> 33:35.489
...young?

33:40.562 --> 33:42.829
Oh.

33:52.139 --> 33:55.808
I think he's deaf.

33:55.876 --> 33:58.210
Are you deaf?

34:00.147 --> 34:02.214
Dance with me, then.

34:51.630 --> 34:53.632
Do I have to marry, Cesare?

34:53.699 --> 34:55.900
No.

34:55.967 --> 34:59.938
You can take the cloth like me.
You can become a nun.

35:00.005 --> 35:02.907
We'll live in sanctity
and prayer, like Abelard

35:02.975 --> 35:05.109
and Eloise.

35:05.177 --> 35:07.713
Did they love each other?

35:07.780 --> 35:11.817
With a love as pure and
all-consuming as the love of God.

35:11.884 --> 35:14.453
So, then.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.554
I shall become a nun.

35:18.457 --> 35:21.359
For I shall never love a husband
as I love you, Cesare.

35:21.426 --> 35:23.027
I am afraid, dear Sis,

35:23.095 --> 35:26.998
that the pope does not ask you
to love your future husband;

35:27.066 --> 35:29.868
merely to marry him.

35:29.935 --> 35:33.204
So, love and marriage...
Are they incompatible?

35:33.272 --> 35:38.508
No. But I have been told that
one does not imply the other.

35:38.576 --> 35:42.779
Is that not sad, Cesare?

35:44.682 --> 35:47.951
Most things in life prove
to be sad, Sis.

35:48.019 --> 35:51.421
Again, I have been told.

35:51.489 --> 35:55.658
And if my husband proves
ungallant?

36:01.465 --> 36:05.269
I shall cut his heart out
with a dinner knife

36:05.336 --> 36:08.038
and serve it to you.

36:15.223 --> 36:17.291
Sforza's the one.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.594
Your Holiness approves of him?

36:21.662 --> 36:25.465
As you have informed us,
Della Rovere has fled Naples,

36:25.533 --> 36:28.601
and is heading north.

36:28.669 --> 36:30.603
Of course.

36:30.671 --> 36:33.473
So if Rome is united
with the Sforza dynasty,

36:33.541 --> 36:37.577
- Mm-hmm. - Milan will close its doors
to him if he seeks help there.

36:37.645 --> 36:40.447
That is the outcome
we wish for.

36:40.514 --> 36:44.250
But these things are never
certain, Cesare.

36:44.318 --> 36:46.319
And what of Lucrezia?

36:46.386 --> 36:53.092
Sforza is personable...
not unlike your brother.

36:53.160 --> 36:56.095
And her mother approves.

36:56.163 --> 36:58.064
Must I ask again,
Your Holiness?

37:01.534 --> 37:04.470
What of Lucrezia?
Her feelings?

37:04.537 --> 37:08.341
You will not ask again.

37:08.408 --> 37:11.010
You know the nature
of these arrangements.

37:15.749 --> 37:18.549
That heathen outstays
his welcome.

37:18.617 --> 37:20.118
How?

37:20.186 --> 37:22.620
You have seen him
dancing with Lucrezia.

37:22.688 --> 37:25.991
So?
Send him home.

37:26.058 --> 37:28.159
We can ill afford to.

37:28.227 --> 37:31.263
There is the matter of a dowry.

37:36.702 --> 37:38.803
Your Eminence.

37:40.706 --> 37:43.474
That manservant
of yours, Cesare.

37:43.542 --> 37:45.476
Micheletto?

37:45.544 --> 37:48.646
I'd borrow him awhile.

37:48.714 --> 37:51.615
- You need his services?
- For a day or two.

37:54.386 --> 37:56.787
Is our father that short
of funds?

37:59.391 --> 38:02.759
He must raise a dowry
for our sister's betrothal.

38:05.730 --> 38:07.998
Can he not borrow
from Florence?

38:08.066 --> 38:13.337
Four hundred thousand ducats
is hard to come by.

38:13.405 --> 38:16.473
So you need my Micheletto.

38:20.412 --> 38:22.679
But you shall not have him.

38:22.747 --> 38:26.750
- You have a soft spot for heathens?
- Maybe.

38:26.818 --> 38:29.553
And our sister loves Djem.

38:29.620 --> 38:32.722
She would miss him
at her wedding.

38:32.790 --> 38:36.192
There are others
of Micheletto's kind in Rome.

38:38.596 --> 38:40.931
Find one, if you can.

38:40.998 --> 38:43.600
But spare me the details.

38:49.106 --> 38:53.710
His food is prepared by his
personal cook, a blackamoor.

38:53.778 --> 38:56.713
His meat must be bled,
and wine is forbidden him.

38:56.781 --> 39:01.384
- Does he not drink water?
- Mint tea, my lord, spiced and sugared.

39:01.452 --> 39:04.387
But cantarella and sugar do not
always mix.

39:04.455 --> 39:06.122
What is this?

39:06.190 --> 39:08.257
A cookery lesson?

39:26.776 --> 39:30.380
A request was made
for a private confession?

39:30.447 --> 39:35.051
It is true I made the request,
though I know little of the rite.

39:35.119 --> 39:36.552
Djem.

39:36.620 --> 39:39.021
It is indeed me,
Cardinal Borgia.

39:39.088 --> 39:42.124
And I have but one thing
to confess.

39:42.191 --> 39:45.927
And what would that be?

39:45.995 --> 39:48.830
I wish to become a Christian.

39:53.436 --> 39:56.004
Why, my dear brother?

39:56.072 --> 40:00.342
Because of the kindness
you Christians have shown to me.

40:00.410 --> 40:05.213
I have found peace
in this Rome of yours.

40:05.281 --> 40:09.717
I have been reading the gospels,
the words of St. Matthew.

40:09.785 --> 40:15.723
"See how these Christians love
one another."

40:15.791 --> 40:20.395
I would gladly embrace
a religion of such charity.

40:22.932 --> 40:26.034
You might find,
dear Djem, that...

40:26.101 --> 40:29.837
...we are not
always so kind.

40:32.274 --> 40:34.308
White is so dull.

40:38.581 --> 40:41.649
But surely a wedding dress
should be white?

40:43.752 --> 40:48.489
This dress... is
for your betrothal, my love.

40:51.259 --> 40:56.163
And given the size of your dowry,
it should be of solid gold.

41:00.868 --> 41:02.769
Open.

41:06.774 --> 41:09.510
Oh!

41:09.578 --> 41:11.645
I wanted, my dear Lucrezia,

41:11.713 --> 41:14.748
to give you a taste
of my homeland.

41:14.816 --> 41:17.883
Before the Lord Sforza plucks
you forever from my view.

41:21.054 --> 41:23.723
Please, brothers, sit.

41:23.790 --> 41:26.426
Moussa, <i>thali!</i>
<i>Food.</i>

41:26.494 --> 41:28.394
It's beautiful, Djem.

41:28.462 --> 41:31.164
<i>- Syre ri.</i>
<i>- How do I eat it?</i>

41:31.232 --> 41:33.966
With your fingers.
Like this.

41:43.075 --> 41:45.877
I also wanted
to thank the three of you

41:45.945 --> 41:48.647
for your kindness towards me.

41:48.714 --> 41:52.651
- Are you leaving us soon?
- Oh, by the heavens, no. I dread the day

41:52.718 --> 41:55.020
I have to leave the bosom
of your kindness.

41:55.087 --> 41:58.190
Our ways at the Courts
of the Sultan can be...

41:58.258 --> 42:02.161
...cruel
beyond your imaginations.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.596
I have a good imagination.

42:04.664 --> 42:06.731
Oh.

42:06.799 --> 42:11.569
My brother's predecessor had the eyes of
all of his male relatives plucked out

42:11.637 --> 42:14.005
and brought to him
on a silver platter.

42:14.073 --> 42:17.208
Twenty-two
of them.

42:17.276 --> 42:21.245
That's 44 eyes.
Why on earth?

42:21.313 --> 42:26.150
Because one who is blind
could never take his place.

42:26.217 --> 42:27.651
Clever.

42:27.719 --> 42:30.620
Mm. So to be
among Christian souls,

42:30.689 --> 42:35.893
among the bosom of a family such
as yours, is fortune indeed.

42:35.960 --> 42:39.563
I'll drink to that.

42:39.630 --> 42:43.867
And to your future happiness,
my dear Lucrezia.

42:43.935 --> 42:46.003
<i>Bismillah.</i>

42:58.716 --> 43:00.649
Your air is, uh...

43:04.788 --> 43:07.156
- Djem.
- Djem?

43:07.224 --> 43:11.694
Forgive me, Cardinal.
I have ruined your attire.

43:11.762 --> 43:13.696
Djem...

43:20.849 --> 43:24.317
- <i>Allahu Akbar.</i>
- <i>Cesare!</i>

43:35.896 --> 43:37.997
You hired an amateur!

43:38.065 --> 43:40.800
You forbade me
your professional.

43:42.736 --> 43:46.839
- You need lessons in killing?
- Cesare!

44:04.925 --> 44:08.527
I have been poisoned, Cesare.

44:08.595 --> 44:12.531
My brother the Sultan has
found a way.

44:12.599 --> 44:15.634
And it can only have been
through this blackamoor here...

44:15.702 --> 44:18.937
he has poisoned me!

44:19.005 --> 44:21.640
Are you sure?

44:21.708 --> 44:24.253
I am certain,
as Allah is my witness.

44:25.669 --> 44:28.338
Who else could have
touched my food?

44:28.405 --> 44:30.073
Guards!

44:43.054 --> 44:45.122
Come, my brother.

44:45.189 --> 44:48.458
We must speak
with the professional.

44:54.331 --> 44:56.967
Cantarella.

44:57.034 --> 44:59.502
Mixed in with his sugar,
my lord.

44:59.570 --> 45:02.806
- Who recommended such a thing?
- The blackamoor prepares his food.

45:02.874 --> 45:06.709
He mixes the sugar with his tea.
There was no other way.

45:06.778 --> 45:10.480
Then he will be in agony
for weeks.

45:10.547 --> 45:14.450
You know of a better way?

45:14.518 --> 45:18.121
- You spoke to no one of this?
- I swear, my lord.

45:18.189 --> 45:21.991
Take him out of here.

45:22.058 --> 45:24.660
Somewhere safe.

45:37.540 --> 45:39.942
And you, my dear brother.

45:40.010 --> 45:42.611
You must finish
what you started.

45:45.882 --> 45:50.052
I will clear the corridor
of the guards.

46:12.742 --> 46:14.776
Leave us.

46:27.022 --> 46:29.924
You would kill our dear Moor?

46:31.828 --> 46:33.895
I thought I had.

46:35.832 --> 46:38.298
Cesare!

46:38.367 --> 46:40.401
Take a breath.

46:45.574 --> 46:47.508
You would not recommend
cantarella, then?

46:47.576 --> 46:50.143
Not with sugar, my friend, no.

47:35.623 --> 47:38.058
Cool me down, brother.

47:38.126 --> 47:40.894
Console me, brother.

47:48.668 --> 47:53.605
A pillow. A towel,
dipped in cold water.

48:00.814 --> 48:02.381
You?

48:10.991 --> 48:14.927
No, no!

48:44.890 --> 48:47.792
So our sister's dowry is done?

48:50.229 --> 48:52.830
Here endeth the first lesson.

49:02.908 --> 49:05.275
<i>"Item:</i>

49:05.343 --> 49:08.846
<i>"for the hospitality provided</i> <i>to
the Royal Highness</i> <i>Prince Djem,</i>

49:08.914 --> 49:15.520
"400,000 ducats from the Sultan <i>of
Constantinople</i> <i>to the Holy See.</i>

49:15.587 --> 49:18.555
<i>"A further 100,000 ducats</i>

49:18.623 --> 49:23.091

<i>"and a further 40,000 ducats</i>

49:27.831 --> 49:31.066
<i>for funeral expenses."</i>

49:36.940 --> 49:39.207
Father God Almighty,

49:39.275 --> 49:44.312
who wert, art, and shall be
blessed world without end,

49:44.380 --> 49:46.515
I beseech Thee,

49:46.583 --> 49:50.118
watch over my daughter,
Lucrezia.

49:52.055 --> 49:58.326
And grant me guidance
and wisdom.

50:03.099 --> 50:06.468
I pray that I have made
the right decision for her.
