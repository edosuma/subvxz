Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>

00:02.161 --> 00:03.842
Cinco's parents are suing Hankmed.

00:03.919 --> 00:04.575
What?

00:04.667 --> 00:06.465
You know that picture of you
sticking a needle into Cinco's ass?

00:06.465 --> 00:07.975
They saw that, and now
they're out for blood.

00:08.023 --> 00:09.897
Listen, my guy hasn't
cracked your website yet,

00:09.897 --> 00:12.062
but he did get the number of
the phone that took that photo.

00:12.168 --> 00:13.438
I'm gonna text it to you.

00:16.419 --> 00:17.752
Why are you calling me?

00:18.438 --> 00:21.187
Let's make this easy. Do it as partners.

00:21.274 --> 00:24.216
Yeah, that's definitely something we
should plan on having a discussion about.

00:24.216 --> 00:25.840
Evan...

00:26.926 --> 00:28.745
We just had the discussion.

00:28.745 --> 00:32.686
I've just been contacted by a
potential candidate in Argentina.

00:33.559 --> 00:34.886
Your jet or mine?

00:34.984 --> 00:36.352
Since you meddled, she won't accept my help,

00:36.470 --> 00:37.716
and now she will be deported.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.850
That is your fault.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.488
Doesn't Sashi have a grandmother
just outside of Buenos Aires

00:42.618 --> 00:43.683
who she's never met?

00:43.765 --> 00:45.519
You're right. We are in.

00:45.565 --> 00:48.811
<i>Mi bonita. Mi preciosa.</i>

00:48.948 --> 00:49.922
Hello, Lorena.

00:50.025 --> 00:52.949
What's impossible is for a
minor to leave the country

00:52.949 --> 00:55.321
without both parents' permission.

00:56.649 --> 00:59.066
As you can see, I am most
eager for your miracle drug.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.234
I'm gonna shock your heart.

01:00.331 --> 01:01.476
You're in v-fib.

01:03.763 --> 01:05.703
I am the pillow king of Hackensack.

01:28.307 --> 01:30.497
- Damn it.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:30.579 --> 01:31.840
Ray, everything's gonna be okay.

01:31.933 --> 01:33.413
I know. They're gone.

01:33.512 --> 01:34.560
You should go too.

01:34.687 --> 01:36.069
No, you need help.

01:36.069 --> 01:37.452
Ah, it's a through-and-through.

01:37.537 --> 01:38.892
I've seen worse. I'll be fine.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.187
Ray, you need a doctor.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.162
- Maybe we should call Hank.
- Hank's in Argentina.

01:42.261 --> 01:43.844
All right, call that other guy, Jerry.

01:43.916 --> 01:45.508
Who's Jerry?

01:49.763 --> 01:51.058
How bad is it?

01:51.058 --> 01:52.381
He's lucky.

01:52.381 --> 01:55.387
No bones, major vessels,
or nerves were affected.

01:56.248 --> 01:58.470
I'll pack the wound with iodoform gauze.

01:58.470 --> 02:00.504
The dressing will need to
be changed twice a day.

02:00.504 --> 02:03.181
I'll also give you a tetanus
shot and prescribe an antibiotic.

02:03.181 --> 02:03.923
Thanks.

02:04.005 --> 02:05.395
Sorry for dragging you out of bed.

02:05.395 --> 02:07.541
Oh, it's okay. I haven't been
sleeping much lately anyway.

02:07.541 --> 02:09.785
A little pressure.

02:09.785 --> 02:11.672
As soon as I'm done
here, I'll call the police.

02:11.771 --> 02:13.227
No. No cops.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.399
Doctors have to report gunshot wounds.

02:15.495 --> 02:16.923
- It's a state law.
- Barely.

02:16.983 --> 02:19.378
It's a misdemeanor, same as jaywalking.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.205
I don't jaywalk.

02:21.281 --> 02:22.596
Well, I've got nothing to tell them.

02:22.687 --> 02:24.761
By the time I got to the
window, the guy was gone.

02:24.761 --> 02:25.718
Really?

02:25.864 --> 02:28.292
It sounded like the car was just outside.

02:28.340 --> 02:30.408
I didn't see anything. Why waste their time?

02:30.498 --> 02:31.496
It's not a waste of their time.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.291
That's their job.

02:32.350 --> 02:34.571
If you make that call,
you're gonna piss me off.

02:40.651 --> 02:41.811
Oh, my God.

02:43.043 --> 02:44.823
- I was so worried.
- It's okay.

02:44.908 --> 02:46.430
I'm fine.

02:49.114 --> 02:50.193
Hey.

02:51.688 --> 02:53.144
Hey, Ray. How's the, uh...

02:53.279 --> 02:54.844
- Oh, everything's good.
- All right.

02:54.956 --> 02:56.354
So now we just wait for the police.

02:56.452 --> 02:58.840
- Oh, we didn't call the cops.
- That's okay. I did.

03:05.111 --> 03:06.266
What?

04:03.270 --> 04:05.946
I still can't believe how
many questions the police had

04:05.983 --> 04:07.757
and how few I could answer.

04:08.828 --> 04:10.533
Yeah, and Ray even less.

04:10.609 --> 04:12.510
Everything happened so fast.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.149
One minute, I'm making a
bed, fluffing a pillow.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.421
And then boom!

04:16.421 --> 04:17.857
There's a gunshot.

04:18.504 --> 04:20.272
I mean, I am a normal person.

04:20.322 --> 04:22.894
Being shot at... So not normal...

04:24.126 --> 04:25.811
Unless you're Ray, I guess.

04:28.301 --> 04:29.598
Evan?

04:31.387 --> 04:32.691
Hey.

04:35.500 --> 04:38.038
I just keep thinking about how
close you came to getting hurt.

04:39.876 --> 04:41.440
Paige, if anything happened to you...

04:41.440 --> 04:43.111
Evan, I'm okay...

04:44.065 --> 04:45.960
Especially now.

04:54.359 --> 04:57.706
What was I thinking,
taking on Ray as a client?

04:57.706 --> 04:59.878
It's better than taking him on as a partner.

05:00.788 --> 05:02.893
Well, Russel and I are
all but done with him,

05:02.962 --> 05:04.565
and you should be done too.

05:05.390 --> 05:07.736
I have to get out. I know.

05:08.678 --> 05:09.966
How?

05:12.290 --> 05:13.670
I don't know.

05:20.371 --> 05:22.853
__

05:30.061 --> 05:32.181
So how is our friend Tobias doing?

05:32.259 --> 05:33.199
Better, better.

05:33.285 --> 05:34.679
He's back in sinus rhythm.

05:34.728 --> 05:36.022
Good work, Hank.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.045
Will this affect his participation
in the clinical trial, you think?

05:40.108 --> 05:42.273
Boris, I'm afraid he's not eligible for it.

05:43.266 --> 05:44.587
But his condition...

05:44.624 --> 05:48.671
Yes, his condition appears to have weakened
both his skeletal and heart muscles.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.261
But cardiomyopathy,

05:50.343 --> 05:51.961
what sent him into cardiac arrest,

05:52.044 --> 05:55.118
that's never been a hallmark of the
VCP mutation the trial is meant for.

05:55.631 --> 05:57.144
Our diseases are different.

05:57.222 --> 05:59.207
I'm just waiting for the
genetic tests to confirm it.

05:59.207 --> 06:00.464
So there's nothing to be done.

06:00.538 --> 06:01.595
No, I didn't say that.

06:01.679 --> 06:02.668
I'll keep monitoring him,

06:02.804 --> 06:05.960
but I want to transfer Tobias to
the hospital as soon as possible.

06:20.457 --> 06:21.847
Oh.

06:22.884 --> 06:25.240
Look who comes to see me...

06:25.240 --> 06:28.310
My beautiful little Sashi.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.659
Good morning, Lorena.

06:31.323 --> 06:32.809
Divya...

06:32.866 --> 06:34.828
I hope you slept well.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.439
I did not.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.429
Look, if Rafa wants to see Sashi,

06:38.517 --> 06:40.892
he can come to New York, as can you.

06:40.986 --> 06:43.359
But we can't stay here.

06:43.359 --> 06:44.597
We have to go home.

06:44.681 --> 06:46.191
<i>You</i> have to go home.

06:46.191 --> 06:48.562
Sashi needs her <i> abuela.</i>

06:48.562 --> 06:52.660
Lorena, please,
think of how you would've felt

06:52.750 --> 06:55.522
if someone had tried to separate you
from your son when he was young.

06:55.522 --> 06:57.496
I'm not trying to separate anyone.

06:57.496 --> 06:59.790
You stay as long as you want.

06:59.888 --> 07:01.243
I can't do that.

07:01.310 --> 07:03.447
Then go. Sashi stays.

07:03.512 --> 07:04.771
No.

07:05.055 --> 07:07.468
Lorena, you cannot hold us hostage.

07:07.538 --> 07:08.953
Hostage?

07:10.196 --> 07:12.479
I'm not holding you hostage.

07:12.479 --> 07:15.239
I am offering you hospitality.

07:15.239 --> 07:18.009
But it seems you have trouble with that.

07:18.086 --> 07:22.130
Otherwise, you and Sashi
wouldn't be homeless.

07:26.249 --> 07:28.046
What's on your elbow?

07:28.906 --> 07:30.595
It's nothing.

07:30.661 --> 07:32.268
Just a rash.

07:33.643 --> 07:35.575
Lorena, please, I think it's more than that.

07:36.349 --> 07:37.962
Let me help you.

07:38.020 --> 07:39.584
Why would you help me?

07:39.866 --> 07:41.757
Because you're in pain.

07:51.408 --> 07:53.042
I'm not going to the hospital.

07:53.085 --> 07:55.095
Tobias, I understand your disappointment.

07:56.026 --> 07:58.899
I can assure you, we will do everything
we can to get you a diagnosis.

07:58.899 --> 08:02.038
Yes, we will, but right now your
cardiologist needs to monitor you

08:02.155 --> 08:03.761
and get you on the
appropriate heart medication.

08:03.841 --> 08:05.379
I can be monitored here.

08:05.459 --> 08:06.706
I don't want to worry Jakob.

08:06.769 --> 08:08.508
But you're at risk for
another cardiac event.

08:08.508 --> 08:10.388

08:20.722 --> 08:22.235
[Speaking Spanish]

08:22.303 --> 08:23.624
- Tobias.
- Aah!

08:23.624 --> 08:24.884
My finger!

08:25.784 --> 08:27.085
Jakob, Jakob...

08:27.142 --> 08:28.438

08:28.511 --> 08:29.935
Let me see. Let me see.

[Speaking Spanish]

08:31.845 --> 08:33.163
Ay, yi, yi.

08:33.253 --> 08:35.662
It's dislocated. Okay.

08:35.746 --> 08:42.202
[Speaking Spanish]

08:43.123 --> 08:45.197
[Speaking Spanish]

08:46.256 --> 08:48.300
Ow! Aah! Aah!

08:48.381 --> 08:50.242
- [Speaking Spanish]
- Yes, thank you.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.473
- Okay, good.
- Thank you.

08:51.528 --> 08:52.545
He's gonna need some ice.

08:52.629 --> 08:54.879
Take him inside, ice it, and I'll
come and splint it in a minute.

08:54.940 --> 08:58.648
[Speaking Spanish]

08:59.418 --> 09:00.262
Come on.

09:02.122 --> 09:03.967
Listen, Tobias, it was an accident.

09:04.030 --> 09:06.411
No. It's my pride.

09:06.894 --> 09:10.246
Trying to hide the truth
from Jakob is foolish.

09:11.313 --> 09:12.789
I hurt him.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.138
I will go to the hospital.

09:17.794 --> 09:20.078
Good. Good. I'm glad to hear that.

09:46.389 --> 09:48.137
Cut! Cut!

09:48.587 --> 09:50.708
I'm sorry. I took too big of a bite.

09:50.767 --> 09:52.370
We need a big bite, Sloane, honey.

09:52.370 --> 09:54.102
So let's get that jaw loose.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.811
Somebody rub her jaw.

09:56.989 --> 09:58.105
Are you the director?

09:58.143 --> 10:00.091
- I'm with Hankmed.
- Loving it.

10:00.186 --> 10:02.953
Yes, I'm the director, Nash Wexler.

10:02.953 --> 10:05.343
Jeremiah Sacani. How can I help?

10:05.419 --> 10:07.270
You can fix Sloane Lerner,

10:07.381 --> 10:09.740
that gorgeous hot mess
over there on the towel.

10:09.740 --> 10:11.741
She was about to be the next big thing

10:11.741 --> 10:14.078
before she became all
miss thing. You feel me?

10:15.105 --> 10:17.054
I don't understand anything you just said.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.710
On her way to the top,
she became a bit of a diva,

10:20.795 --> 10:23.240
and her go-to move is feeling "sick."

10:23.292 --> 10:24.548
That's why I called you.

10:24.626 --> 10:26.222
You want me to examine her?

10:26.307 --> 10:28.978
Unless you're hungry
and look good in a bikini.

10:29.919 --> 10:31.888
Sure, play along. Examine her.

10:31.966 --> 10:33.747
Test her. Treat her. I don't care.

10:33.798 --> 10:35.248
It's too late to replace her,

10:35.248 --> 10:38.669
and I need to make a super
sexy clam sandwich commercial.

10:40.786 --> 10:42.287
I'll do what I can.

10:54.618 --> 10:56.431
- Any allergies?
- No.

10:57.577 --> 10:59.731
Does the nausea persist,
or does it come and go?

10:59.792 --> 11:00.957
It comes and goes.

11:01.268 --> 11:02.893
And has this happened before?

11:02.893 --> 11:04.974
No, every other time I've
eaten 42 clam sandwiches,

11:05.055 --> 11:06.524
I've been absolutely fine.

11:08.111 --> 11:09.655
Yeah, it's happened before.

11:10.246 --> 11:11.717
I was never really a big eater,

11:11.808 --> 11:14.972
but lately, it's been like
this after every meal.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.521
So you eat less and less.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.101
Yeah, which keeps me in a swimsuit,

11:18.179 --> 11:21.416
but off the set, I just feel so lousy.

11:21.852 --> 11:24.102
And everyone here just thinks
I have an eating disorder,

11:24.159 --> 11:25.338
which I don't.

11:25.402 --> 11:27.181
I'll give you an antinausea medication.

11:27.181 --> 11:29.450
We'll run some tests and see what comes up.

11:29.497 --> 11:31.745
Thanks. But please don't say "comes up."

11:31.868 --> 11:33.236
I'm still feeling a little bit queasy.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.341
- Excuse me. Can I get a water?
- Sure, what would you...

11:35.429 --> 11:37.250
I need a glass bottle, not a plastic bottle,

11:37.250 --> 11:39.506
and pour it in a glass, not a plastic glass.

11:39.588 --> 11:41.771
So glass, glass, with a
squeeze of lemon, okay?

11:42.117 --> 11:43.316
Love you.

11:43.922 --> 11:44.823
So do you think you can help me out

11:44.906 --> 11:46.819
before I get a reputation as a diva?

11:47.980 --> 11:49.124
Dude, relax.

11:49.182 --> 11:50.607
I know I already have one.

11:50.682 --> 11:53.077
Otherwise, I'd still be
doing Chanel, not Chewy's.

11:53.077 --> 11:55.852
But I'm never gonna get back
there unless you help me out.

11:55.852 --> 11:58.317
So just tell me what you need from me.

11:59.162 --> 12:00.445
Blood and urine.

12:00.873 --> 12:02.144
This one's for you.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.566
Evan, have a seat.

12:13.631 --> 12:16.196
Listen, we need to talk.

12:16.783 --> 12:18.216
No, we don't.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.150
I-I thought...

12:20.150 --> 12:21.719
I do...

12:22.112 --> 12:24.907
Because I know what you're going through.

12:26.018 --> 12:27.384
I'm not sure you do.

12:27.430 --> 12:28.616
You're angry.

12:28.668 --> 12:29.898
You're scared.

12:29.946 --> 12:31.816
You want to get things on an even keel,

12:31.894 --> 12:35.838
controllable, knowable, calm.

12:37.707 --> 12:39.382
Okay, maybe you do.

12:39.776 --> 12:41.118
Please.

12:43.489 --> 12:45.550
Look, I get it.

12:45.587 --> 12:46.900
And I'm sorry.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.195
I don't need an apology from you.

12:48.259 --> 12:49.446
You're the one who got shot, right?

12:49.446 --> 12:52.076
Believe me, I know that things
could've gone very different.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.549
That's right, which is why I...

12:54.681 --> 12:58.305
Which is why you have my word
it will never happen again.

12:59.104 --> 13:00.652
How can you guarantee that?

13:00.719 --> 13:04.416
Evan, there are no guarantees in life.

13:04.488 --> 13:05.950
- You know that.
- Uhhuh.

13:06.030 --> 13:08.245
But trust me, it's under control...

13:08.743 --> 13:10.365
Guaranteed.

13:12.079 --> 13:14.492
I can't do this. I can't do it anymore.

13:14.787 --> 13:16.242
Things have to change. I'm sorry.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.598
Ugh, okay.

13:17.704 --> 13:19.836
Like I said, I get it.

13:20.195 --> 13:23.040
I don't love it, but I get it.

13:24.587 --> 13:26.502
You drive a hard bargain, Passaic.

13:26.559 --> 13:28.651
From now on, you are in charge,

13:28.717 --> 13:31.141
and I am the silent partner...

13:31.228 --> 13:32.549
Invisible, even.

13:32.549 --> 13:33.665
Right, that's not what I had in...

13:33.665 --> 13:36.487
- Bring it in.
- Right, but that's not...

13:36.552 --> 13:37.615
Shh.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.950
Right.

13:45.830 --> 13:48.420
Do you take anything for
the pain or the rash?

13:48.719 --> 13:51.016
Actron or afebril.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.135
And for the rash, clotrix.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.394
- But they don't work, do they?
- No.

13:56.476 --> 13:59.481
That's because you don't
have osteoarthritis, Lorena.

13:59.593 --> 14:01.395
You have psoriatic arthritis.

14:01.450 --> 14:02.794
Both present with joint pain,

14:02.888 --> 14:04.925
but psoriatic arthritis
also gives you a rash,

14:04.993 --> 14:06.620
like the one you have on your elbow.

14:06.620 --> 14:08.233
This is what you should be using...

14:10.443 --> 14:12.924
A TNF-alpha antagonist.

14:14.174 --> 14:16.094
How do I know this is true?

14:17.073 --> 14:18.806
Talk to your doctor.

14:19.573 --> 14:22.692
Lorena, what do you think is going
to happen when Rafa gets here...

14:23.768 --> 14:26.402
That we'll all just be
one big, happy family?

14:26.481 --> 14:29.509
Rafa and I have an arrangement
that we're both fine with.

14:29.604 --> 14:32.042
Threatening me, not to mention his daughter,

14:32.129 --> 14:34.515
couldn't possibly bring you closer to him.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.441
And isn't that what you want?

14:36.506 --> 14:38.034
How can you know what I want?

14:38.138 --> 14:41.223
Because I see how alone you are, how lonely.

14:41.301 --> 14:43.624
This medication could ease your pain

14:43.728 --> 14:46.217
and let you travel to
be with Rafa, your baby.

14:46.289 --> 14:47.985
It could change your life.

14:48.105 --> 14:50.839
You only want me to let you take Sashi.

14:50.935 --> 14:53.977
Unless you plan to physically restrain me,

14:54.055 --> 14:56.035
I am taking Sashi...

14:56.131 --> 14:57.389
Today.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.099
I am done fighting here.

15:00.165 --> 15:02.664
If I must, I'll fight
customs at the airport.

15:02.747 --> 15:05.895
So, if you intend to have any further
relationship with your granddaughter,

15:05.987 --> 15:07.413
I suggest that you back down,

15:07.511 --> 15:08.739
and you take this medicine.

15:08.821 --> 15:11.988
Sashi is Rafa's baby as much as yours,

15:12.066 --> 15:14.055
and she belongs in his life.

15:14.124 --> 15:16.421
I never said she didn't.

15:20.469 --> 15:22.443
Now give me the shot.

15:23.939 --> 15:25.510
Gladly.

15:36.609 --> 15:38.127
Hey, I wasn't getting any reception,

15:38.204 --> 15:39.790
but I just got all your Lorena texts.

15:39.877 --> 15:41.579
Oh, thank you, Argentina.

15:41.678 --> 15:44.449
I am sorry your stay was
difficult, Miss Katdare.

15:44.547 --> 15:47.318
Too often, people insert themselves
where they don't belong...

15:47.415 --> 15:49.336
Family in particular.

15:49.686 --> 15:51.731
- Friends too.
- Hey...

15:52.211 --> 15:54.492
You were only doing what you
thought was best for Jeremiah.

15:54.570 --> 15:56.923
That's what Lorena said
about wanting to keep Sashi.

15:58.114 --> 15:59.680
Had I been aware of your predicament,

15:59.764 --> 16:01.523
I could've provided some assistance.

16:01.621 --> 16:03.598
Well, if it happens again,
I'll let you know.

16:03.690 --> 16:05.825
But honestly, I'm glad I did it on my own.

16:05.918 --> 16:08.137
If I can handle Lorena, I can handle...

16:10.377 --> 16:11.978
It's not her.

16:15.779 --> 16:18.254
Oh, but I just got all your Tobias texts.

16:18.334 --> 16:19.901
So what was his diagnosis?

16:19.966 --> 16:22.077
Something genetic, but not
what the trial is targeting.

16:22.176 --> 16:23.554
A different orphan disease?

16:23.652 --> 16:25.612
- Unfortunately, yeah.
- "Orphan disease"?

16:25.691 --> 16:27.946
A rare condition that lacks
attention and funding.

16:27.946 --> 16:31.165
Not all illnesses are lucky enough
to have a generous benefactor.

16:31.513 --> 16:33.094
And even when they are diagnosed,

16:33.167 --> 16:34.331
treatments often aren't developed,

16:34.428 --> 16:36.610
since not enough people would
buy them to make it profitable.

16:36.685 --> 16:38.601
No one claims them... orphans.

16:38.677 --> 16:39.880
I see.

16:40.130 --> 16:44.053
I never felt so hopeful as the day
Marisa gave a name to my condition,

16:44.472 --> 16:46.141
for myself and for my son.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.947
Tobias should have that too.

16:49.582 --> 16:51.771
We're parents. We want
to protect our children.

16:52.818 --> 16:54.022
Yeah.

16:54.741 --> 16:58.207
Perhaps I should adopt some
of these orphan diseases.

16:58.308 --> 17:02.059
Oh, well, Boris, that would mean a
significant expansion of your foundation

17:02.155 --> 17:04.220
and a major financial commitment.

17:36.524 --> 17:38.331
Sink your teeth into the Hamptons

17:38.409 --> 17:41.027
with Chewy's new clam sandwich.

17:41.113 --> 17:42.833
It's clam-tastic.

17:45.241 --> 17:47.502
Stop slouching!

17:47.562 --> 17:48.903
You look beautiful, honey,

17:48.958 --> 17:51.142
but please raise your left shoulder!

17:51.234 --> 17:52.849
Love you!

17:53.431 --> 17:55.092
Why does she keep leaning to one side?

17:55.154 --> 17:56.477
Is the sandwich too heavy?

17:56.555 --> 17:58.381
Can we get her a lighter sandwich?

17:58.432 --> 18:00.313
- Where's the food stylist?
- Right away.

18:01.777 --> 18:03.730
Oh, hello. I thought you left.

18:03.730 --> 18:06.514
I did. I came back for a follow-up.

18:06.587 --> 18:07.899
After this take.

18:07.899 --> 18:09.665
Still rolling!

18:09.737 --> 18:11.306
Back to one!

18:12.479 --> 18:15.149
Everyone be brilliant!

18:15.635 --> 18:17.273
And playback!

18:17.646 --> 18:20.522
And action!

18:24.192 --> 18:27.155
Yes. Yes.

18:27.349 --> 18:29.116
Perfect.

18:29.218 --> 18:30.770
Chew it.

18:30.883 --> 18:32.082
Love it.

18:32.162 --> 18:33.866
Swallow it.

18:33.925 --> 18:36.916
Okay.

18:36.988 --> 18:38.338
Is she really sick

18:38.416 --> 18:40.328
or just very open with her bulimia?

18:40.328 --> 18:41.597
I don't know yet.

18:45.228 --> 18:46.789
Do I have to drink this?

18:46.873 --> 18:49.151
It's a necessary radiocontrasting agent,

18:49.254 --> 18:50.791
and given your symptoms, I need to make sure

18:50.876 --> 18:54.269
you don't have an obstruction
or an inflammatory disorder,

18:54.340 --> 18:58.502
such as celiac disease or
Crohn's or ulcerative colitis.

19:00.027 --> 19:01.553
Yes, you have to.

19:01.591 --> 19:02.747
Cheers.

19:07.236 --> 19:08.751
- Take your time.
- Mm.

19:09.973 --> 19:11.226
Oof.

19:11.940 --> 19:13.609
It's no clam sandwich.

19:14.184 --> 19:15.284
Knock, knock.

19:15.895 --> 19:17.291
Hey, girl.

19:17.373 --> 19:18.298
Hey.

19:18.375 --> 19:20.021
I'm so sorry about all of this.

19:20.110 --> 19:22.785
Oh, please, all I care about
is that you get better,

19:22.846 --> 19:24.229
'cause the sooner you do,

19:24.282 --> 19:27.870
the sooner we can take
advantage of this gorgeous sky

19:27.948 --> 19:30.094
and your gorgeous body,

19:30.186 --> 19:33.344
and we can get this in the
can before we lose the light.

19:35.583 --> 19:36.921
Oh, my God.

19:37.033 --> 19:39.129
Oh, my God, I'm so, so sorry.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.769
I'm so, so, so sorry.

19:42.168 --> 19:43.589
It happens.

19:43.677 --> 19:46.419
I wanted to go back to
Italy to buy pants anyway.

19:47.943 --> 19:50.294
- So what do we do now?
- We get you a C.T.

19:51.278 --> 19:53.125
I think she's really sick.

20:02.765 --> 20:04.443
So how much longer do we do this?

20:04.536 --> 20:05.784
Shh.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.695
Violence, violence-related,

20:08.774 --> 20:10.873
even violence-adjacent incidents

20:10.949 --> 20:15.043
traumatize not only our
bodies, but our psyches.

20:15.365 --> 20:19.027
Reestablishing a sense of
physical safety is vital.

20:21.890 --> 20:24.113
Is there gonna be a
bathroom break at some point?

20:25.403 --> 20:26.799
Oh, we're done.

20:31.293 --> 20:32.496
Okay.

20:32.975 --> 20:35.710
Paige, how are you feeling
about the shooting?

20:37.794 --> 20:39.418
Like it was a dream.

20:39.491 --> 20:40.962
A dream or a nightmare?

20:41.058 --> 20:44.550
No, a dream, because I don't feel scared.

20:44.647 --> 20:47.683
I just feel like that can't have happened,

20:47.770 --> 20:49.377
like it doesn't make sense.

20:49.472 --> 20:50.937
And yet, it did happen.

20:52.020 --> 20:54.863
I guess we were all a little in denial
about the kind of person Ray was.

20:54.936 --> 20:56.638
- "Was"?
- Is.

20:56.734 --> 20:58.918
And Ray is still your business partner?

20:59.020 --> 21:00.046
Was.

21:01.109 --> 21:02.483
Is.

21:02.543 --> 21:04.457
What? I thought you broke up with him.

21:04.544 --> 21:06.379
I tried, okay? It didn't work.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.789
Or you thought you tried, but you didn't.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.368
No, I tried.

21:10.446 --> 21:11.349
Okay.

21:12.620 --> 21:14.497
Let's hear your version.

21:26.150 --> 21:27.215
You can do this.

21:27.312 --> 21:29.545
Remember, it's okay to walk away.

21:29.632 --> 21:30.768
Okay.

21:32.588 --> 21:33.581
Evan.

21:33.994 --> 21:35.266
What's going on?

21:35.326 --> 21:36.501
Who's this?

21:37.789 --> 21:40.397
This is Bob, my therapist.

21:40.478 --> 21:42.657
Okay. Why is he here?

21:43.583 --> 21:45.876
Because I...

21:45.965 --> 21:47.582
It's...

21:49.828 --> 21:52.264
Because we need to talk, Ray,

21:52.343 --> 21:53.755
and he's a great facilitator.

21:53.755 --> 21:55.202
So can we come in?

21:55.265 --> 21:56.324
No, now's not great.

21:56.413 --> 21:58.124
What's this about? I thought we were good.

21:58.947 --> 22:00.705
Well, you were.

22:00.942 --> 22:02.755
But I-I wasn't.

22:03.669 --> 22:05.389
So we're not.

22:05.843 --> 22:08.188
- Is that right?
- That's right.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.691
- We'll come back.
- Wait, wai...

22:14.768 --> 22:17.827
No, we're here. Let's just do it.

22:17.908 --> 22:19.929
Fine. I could use a little air.

22:20.398 --> 22:21.873
Let's take a walk...

22:21.954 --> 22:23.379
in the woods.

22:24.694 --> 22:28.899
I'm... I'm so sorry, but
I'm like candy for bugs.

22:28.968 --> 22:30.916
So the woods are a no-no for me

22:31.011 --> 22:32.803
unless I bathe in repellant, which I...

22:32.883 --> 22:34.236
- Don't worry, Bob.
- Ah.

22:34.314 --> 22:35.776
Uh, Evan?

22:37.456 --> 22:39.334
It's okay to walk away, Bob.

22:39.410 --> 22:40.861
Terrific. I'll uber home.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.470
Lovely to meet you, Ray.

22:44.465 --> 22:46.280
After you.

23:01.462 --> 23:02.608
Hey.

23:02.687 --> 23:04.500
- So what'd you find?
- Um...

23:04.835 --> 23:06.147
Nothing.

23:06.981 --> 23:09.792
Your C.T. is clean, just
like all your previous tests.

23:10.801 --> 23:11.820
I don't understand.

23:11.820 --> 23:13.522
I mean, you were there. You saw me.

23:13.620 --> 23:17.104
I can't eat anything without
feeling nauseous and throwing up.

23:17.204 --> 23:19.062
Yes, but without any evidence of a blockage

23:19.153 --> 23:21.712
and with test results indicating
no intestinal disorder,

23:21.806 --> 23:24.117
I'm unable to diagnose anything physical.

23:24.617 --> 23:26.037
So you're saying it's mental?

23:26.121 --> 23:28.058
No, I'm saying...

23:28.121 --> 23:30.894
That you think I'm anorexic? Bulimic?

23:31.866 --> 23:33.673
Listen, I swear, I'm not.

23:33.673 --> 23:36.436
I want to eat. My body just won't let me.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.624
I could order a colonoscopy,

23:38.705 --> 23:41.477
but I'm not confident it
would reveal anything further.

23:41.477 --> 23:43.542
No. Never mind.

23:43.907 --> 23:45.332
You don't understand.

23:47.404 --> 23:49.392
I understand your frustration.

23:49.468 --> 23:50.370
Do you?

23:50.976 --> 23:53.514
Do you wake up every morning
feeling nauseous and dehydrated

23:53.619 --> 23:56.267
and battle stomach pains for
hours every time you eat?

23:56.736 --> 23:59.747
Can you imagine seeing everyone
around you enjoy their food

23:59.828 --> 24:02.588
while you have stabbing
pains in your stomach?

24:03.034 --> 24:04.328
No.

24:04.328 --> 24:05.517
No.

24:06.663 --> 24:08.255
I'm sorry.

24:10.166 --> 24:11.298
If it's any consolation,

24:11.362 --> 24:13.899
you're not the first woman
I've disappointed this week.

24:15.977 --> 24:19.187
Good-bye, Dr. Sacani. You're fired.

24:28.915 --> 24:30.329
Beautiful, isn't it?

24:30.917 --> 24:33.311
You go far enough, you could just get lost,

24:33.397 --> 24:34.842
and no one would ever find you.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.547
Then let's just not go too far, then.

24:37.273 --> 24:39.055
We're talking, not camping, right?

24:40.176 --> 24:41.708
Right.

24:44.369 --> 24:45.916
So listen...

24:55.141 --> 24:58.250
So what's on your mind?

24:59.118 --> 25:00.990
I don't want to be your partner, Ray,

25:01.396 --> 25:05.224
not if you're silent or
invisible or imaginary.

25:05.613 --> 25:07.481
- I want out.
- Well, what are we gonna do?

25:07.543 --> 25:10.811
Have a going-out-of-business sale four
weeks after we went into business?

25:11.166 --> 25:12.578
"X-Ray machines, half price.

25:12.678 --> 25:13.961
Everything must go."

25:14.033 --> 25:15.365
No, I don't like it.

25:15.771 --> 25:17.129
Well, I figured you wouldn't.

25:17.208 --> 25:18.488
And given how much we've both invested,

25:18.581 --> 25:20.507
I'm betting you're in no
position to buy me out.

25:20.617 --> 25:21.347
No, I'm not.

25:21.457 --> 25:23.239
And obviously, you're
not just gonna walk away.

25:26.468 --> 25:28.710
- Yes, I am.
- Seriously?

25:31.087 --> 25:32.626
Yeah.

25:33.234 --> 25:34.579
I'm done.

25:35.153 --> 25:36.896
Good-bye, Ray.

25:40.816 --> 25:42.472
Don't walk away from me, Evan.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.927
No one walks away from me.

25:57.279 --> 25:59.188
- Morning, guys.
- Hey.

26:00.009 --> 26:01.876
So listen, a lot happened
while you were gone.

26:01.962 --> 26:03.908
- I need to talk.
- And I need coffee. Can it wait?

26:04.020 --> 26:05.306
- Not really.
- Perfect.

26:05.430 --> 26:08.456
You know, sometimes I feel
like you don't listen to me.

26:10.490 --> 26:12.394
You know, something's got
to be done about those two.

26:12.479 --> 26:14.725
I completely agree. But first,
hey, we really need to talk.

26:14.805 --> 26:15.968
- Emma.
- Hey.

26:16.060 --> 26:17.918
I didn't even hear you come home last night.

26:18.045 --> 26:19.368
Oh, I got in late, and I
didn't want to wake you.

26:19.423 --> 26:22.198
- How'd it go while I was gone?
- Uh, it went pretty well.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.879
Anyways, I'm really glad you're back.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.509
- Yeah, I'm glad...
- Yeah, me too.

26:27.402 --> 26:30.365
Sorry. We just need to get
this staff meeting started, so...

26:30.452 --> 26:32.209
- Oh. Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

26:32.309 --> 26:34.190
Well, uh, I'll talk to you later.

26:34.265 --> 26:35.867
Yeah, absolutely. Bye, Emma.

26:37.227 --> 26:39.064
Okay, what was that about?

26:39.129 --> 26:41.753
She took the picture of you and
Cinco and sold it to Snarkhampton.

26:41.989 --> 26:44.004
What? No.

26:44.095 --> 26:46.155
Yeah. She lied to us.

26:46.453 --> 26:48.740
Breaks my heart to say it,
but she can't be trusted.

26:49.033 --> 26:50.144
And that's not everything.

26:50.220 --> 26:51.645
Guys, can we please get started?

26:51.726 --> 26:53.136
Yeah, unless there's
anything urgent to discuss,

26:53.232 --> 26:54.706
I just need one more minute with Hank.

26:54.807 --> 26:55.597
So Ray...

26:55.700 --> 26:57.697
- A patient fired me yesterday.
- What?

26:58.457 --> 27:00.523
W-wait. Why?

27:00.859 --> 27:02.114
I don't know.

27:02.191 --> 27:03.918
Women confuse me.

27:04.244 --> 27:05.544
Her name is Sloane Lerner.

27:05.578 --> 27:07.776
She's a model who can't keep any food down.

27:08.722 --> 27:09.995
Could she be bulimic?

27:10.071 --> 27:12.053
No, her vomiting is done very publicly.

27:12.147 --> 27:13.569
- Did you consider food poisoning?
- Of course.

27:13.631 --> 27:14.455
- Celiac?
- Yes.

27:14.517 --> 27:15.762
- Crohn's?
- Obviously.

27:15.817 --> 27:17.249
- How about ulcerative...
- Ulcerative colitis, yes.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.085
I considered all those things.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.219
Well, you can't give up on her.

27:25.054 --> 27:27.467
Why don't you both follow up with Sloane?

27:27.549 --> 27:29.199
Because, as I mentioned, she fired me.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.061
Right, but as Divya mentioned,

27:31.132 --> 27:32.936
since when do we give up on a patient?

27:33.415 --> 27:34.777
Maybe bringing in a set of fresh eyes

27:34.861 --> 27:36.968
and a female perspective will change things.

27:37.439 --> 27:39.551
I can't. I have to change Ray's bandages.

27:39.592 --> 27:41.728
I'll change his bandag... his bandages?

27:41.819 --> 27:42.823
What happened to Ray?

27:42.921 --> 27:44.223
Okay, this is what I've
been trying to tell you.

27:44.300 --> 27:45.953
- He got shot.
- Shot?

27:45.953 --> 27:48.723
Paige was there. He didn't
want to call the police.

27:48.802 --> 27:50.059
Hanklab... done.

27:50.173 --> 27:51.358
Wait, wait, wait. Is Paige okay?

27:51.430 --> 27:52.643
- She's fine.
- And what about Ray?

27:52.736 --> 27:54.108
He's fine too.

27:54.108 --> 27:55.855
Why would you not tell me all this?

27:57.367 --> 27:59.560
Because you had to get coffee.

28:08.831 --> 28:11.287
That's interesting. Tell me about that.

28:12.015 --> 28:14.330
I just can't get the
shooting out of my mind.

28:14.875 --> 28:17.287
It feels like something's missing.

28:17.328 --> 28:19.287
There is. Closure.

28:20.137 --> 28:21.855
But if art therapy isn't working,

28:21.935 --> 28:23.085
there are other techniques...

28:23.183 --> 28:26.147
Support groups, drum
circles, reverse birthing.

28:26.237 --> 28:28.533
No. No, this needs...

28:28.616 --> 28:30.663
Wait, what's reverse birthing?

28:30.749 --> 28:34.135
We use a pair of bean-bag
chairs and an inflatable pool

28:34.237 --> 28:35.931
to simulate a return to the womb...

28:36.026 --> 28:37.097
Very healing.

28:38.251 --> 28:40.189
You know, I think I'll just go talk to Ray.

28:40.269 --> 28:45.898
And I think you are confusing
emotional closure with closing the case.

28:46.442 --> 28:47.579
Yeah.

28:47.642 --> 28:51.290
Maybe I am, but I'm not gonna be satisfied

28:51.378 --> 28:53.670
unless I have a face-to-face
conversation with him...

28:54.278 --> 28:55.459
The sooner the better.

28:55.542 --> 28:56.700
Well, between you and Evan,

28:56.794 --> 28:59.051
I don't know who is more impressive.

29:05.022 --> 29:07.138
Dr. Sacani, I was about to call you.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.835
- What's wrong?
- Sloane's gotten worse.

29:12.011 --> 29:14.032
Sloane. Sloane.

29:14.671 --> 29:17.104
Sloane, this is my physician
assistant, Divya Katdare.

29:17.185 --> 29:18.761
- Can you turn over for us?
- No.

29:18.823 --> 29:19.981
Okay, what about extending your legs?

29:20.058 --> 29:22.081
She says it's too painful to stay straight.

29:31.359 --> 29:33.335
Her pulse is weak and thready,
and she's running a fever.

29:35.696 --> 29:37.149
I need to check her stomach.

29:37.922 --> 29:39.225
Ow!

29:39.312 --> 29:40.735
Her abdomen is hard and distended.

29:40.838 --> 29:42.087
- Call 911.
- On it.

29:42.188 --> 29:43.276
Call 911.

29:43.716 --> 29:44.967
Thank you.

29:46.471 --> 29:49.869
Patients with Wilkie's syndrome experience
greater pain when faceup or to the right.

29:49.959 --> 29:51.628
Yesterday Sloane kept leaning to her left.

29:51.714 --> 29:54.285
So she could've developed an
obstruction of the small intestine.

29:54.769 --> 29:56.262
We need to perform the Hayes maneuver.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.330
Sloane, let me move you onto your back.

29:59.387 --> 30:00.764
Let me move you.

30:01.238 --> 30:02.410
Good.

30:02.483 --> 30:03.995
And if you could extend your legs slightly.

30:04.943 --> 30:05.746
Hang in there, Sloane.

30:05.746 --> 30:06.959
This is gonna relieve the obstruction.

30:07.049 --> 30:08.069
Intense pressure now.

30:14.602 --> 30:15.594
Oh, my God.

30:16.071 --> 30:17.730
The pain... It's going away.

30:18.286 --> 30:21.079
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

30:21.434 --> 30:24.162
Thank you. Thank you.

30:24.229 --> 30:25.732
We need to get you to a hospital.

30:40.814 --> 30:41.989
Can we do this some other time?

30:42.063 --> 30:43.764
No, but we can make it quick.

30:44.630 --> 30:46.100
I keep thinking about the shooting,

30:46.184 --> 30:48.060
and something's off.

30:48.152 --> 30:50.068
There's a missing piece to the puzzle.

30:50.143 --> 30:52.647
Well, I've never been much of a puzzle guy.

30:52.731 --> 30:54.916
No, he likes other kinds of games.

30:56.208 --> 30:58.395
You have got some nerve showing up here.

31:00.377 --> 31:02.139
Paige Lawson, this is...

31:02.220 --> 31:04.740
Olivia Mazzarino, Ray's wife.

31:05.126 --> 31:06.870
Oh, hi.

31:06.944 --> 31:08.949
Ray must be so happy you're here.

31:09.290 --> 31:12.141
And, of course, this is not the
housewarming he had in mind,

31:12.263 --> 31:13.592
but...

31:13.698 --> 31:15.218
I hope you like it.

31:17.653 --> 31:18.896
Nice to meet you, by the way.

31:18.956 --> 31:20.554
You want to talk about the house.

31:20.617 --> 31:21.275
Okay.

31:21.393 --> 31:26.854
Um, well, every detail was meant
to reflect your lives together,

31:26.987 --> 31:28.045
from the screening room,

31:28.103 --> 31:30.989
inspired by your first date
at the Oritani Movie Theater,

31:31.070 --> 31:32.843
to the amphorae outside,

31:32.927 --> 31:34.724
to remind you of your honeymoon in Greece.

31:34.818 --> 31:36.555
And you know your favorite Japanese place?

31:36.982 --> 31:39.402
We got one of those fancy
toilets you like that clean you.

31:40.459 --> 31:42.765
For Ray, no detail was too big or too small,

31:42.845 --> 31:44.504
as long as it made you happy.

31:44.567 --> 31:45.695
Even the house itself...

31:45.796 --> 31:47.655
Stop. I've heard enough.

31:49.611 --> 31:51.479
You were telling the truth.

31:52.019 --> 31:54.229
You're not having an affair with her.

31:54.698 --> 31:55.987
With me?

31:56.077 --> 31:57.217
Of course not.

31:57.318 --> 32:00.028
I told you, Liv. I've changed.

32:09.439 --> 32:12.685
I take it back. It is nice to meet you.

32:18.283 --> 32:20.046
You shot him.

32:20.556 --> 32:21.519
What?

32:21.599 --> 32:22.868
That bruise.

32:22.959 --> 32:24.721
It's from a pistol kickback.

32:24.825 --> 32:26.915
I used to get them when
my dad took me shooting.

32:28.818 --> 32:30.727
I go to a range sometimes.

32:30.826 --> 32:33.840
And I heard tires squealing
but no engine noise

32:33.948 --> 32:36.222
because it was an electric car...

32:36.283 --> 32:38.414
The Tesla, your car,

32:38.508 --> 32:42.206
which you saw, but you
didn't say anything...

32:43.028 --> 32:44.859
Because you were protecting her.

32:44.950 --> 32:46.040
Um...

32:46.462 --> 32:48.732
It's been a rocky stretch for us.

32:49.071 --> 32:51.636
I got to the Hamptons early,
saw you in the bedroom,

32:51.721 --> 32:53.564
and assumed you were his new mistress.

32:54.409 --> 32:57.241
So I gave him a little warning
shot to send a message.

32:59.767 --> 33:01.696
I just love him so much.

33:02.030 --> 33:03.523
I get jealous.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.593
Lucky for me, you're a good shot.

33:05.659 --> 33:06.884
The best.

33:07.261 --> 33:09.493
She comes from a long line of cops.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.085
That's how we met.

33:11.952 --> 33:13.887
He looks hot in handcuffs.

33:14.550 --> 33:16.254
I can't believe you got the toilet.

33:18.142 --> 33:19.793
Oh, hon, you're really sweaty.

33:20.155 --> 33:21.642
Ray?

33:23.107 --> 33:24.159
Are you all right?

33:36.263 --> 33:37.359
Oh, my God.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.706
Yeah, it smells sweet,

33:41.780 --> 33:44.117
and there are gas bubbles
accumulating under the skin.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.004
It's gas gangrene.

33:46.096 --> 33:47.231
Call 911.

33:47.971 --> 33:49.421
How did he get gangrene?

33:49.458 --> 33:50.533
It was a minor injury.

33:50.625 --> 33:52.674
For Ray, there's no such
thing as a minor injury.

33:54.459 --> 33:55.720
You can tell her.

33:59.020 --> 34:02.422
Your husband has a chronic liver
condition called cholangitis.

34:02.422 --> 34:04.091
It can compromise his ability to heal,

34:04.250 --> 34:06.771
which means this infection
could be life-threatening.

34:12.996 --> 34:14.446
You're sick.

34:16.034 --> 34:17.629
- An ambulance is on the way.
- Good.

34:17.710 --> 34:19.357
This wound needs aggressive
surgical debridement,

34:19.447 --> 34:20.918
or he could lose his arm.

34:30.132 --> 34:31.788
You have Wilkie's syndrome.

34:32.275 --> 34:33.433
Am I gonna live?

34:33.509 --> 34:35.206
It's a rare gastrovascular disorder

34:35.289 --> 34:38.009
characterized by compression
of the third portion of the duodenum

34:38.074 --> 34:39.735
by the abdominal aorta,

34:39.835 --> 34:41.370
as well as the overlying mesenter...

34:41.458 --> 34:43.435
Yes, you're going to live.

34:43.532 --> 34:45.746
Every time you ate, your
stomach was being squeezed

34:45.847 --> 34:47.659
as if it had a lap-band around it.

34:47.745 --> 34:50.253
You will need duodenal bypass
surgery in the morning.

34:50.321 --> 34:52.291
But then you should have no more symptoms.

34:52.415 --> 34:53.976
Your career can get back on track,

34:54.071 --> 34:55.686
and you can eat whatever you want.

34:55.777 --> 34:57.599
As long as it's not clams.

35:00.723 --> 35:03.767
I'm sorry I didn't diagnose
your condition sooner.

35:05.792 --> 35:07.500
I'm sorry I fired you.

35:08.737 --> 35:11.143
And I'm really grateful that
you didn't give up on me.

35:11.919 --> 35:13.302
Not a lot of people are like that.

35:17.650 --> 35:19.252
More than you would think.

35:26.496 --> 35:28.690
Now you know why I didn't
want the police involved.

35:30.419 --> 35:32.070
You were trying to protect your wife.

35:32.107 --> 35:33.325
I was trying to protect mine.

35:33.397 --> 35:35.046
That's why I wanted out of the business.

35:35.495 --> 35:37.226
Sorry it didn't work out.

35:37.850 --> 35:39.197
Me too.

35:40.286 --> 35:42.153
But I hope things work out with Olivia.

35:42.806 --> 35:45.683
I've been so busy trying to
give her everything she wants,

35:45.727 --> 35:48.321
when all she really wants
is to take care of me.

35:48.386 --> 35:49.711
Now she can.

35:50.034 --> 35:51.836
She's bringing dinner. You want fagioli?

35:52.755 --> 35:54.339
I do love fagioli.

35:54.380 --> 35:56.718
And thank you, but, no. Uh, no time.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.916
We've got to start looking for a
new lab space and a new partner.

35:59.916 --> 36:01.739
Oh, you'll be fine, Passaic.

36:01.844 --> 36:03.560
You convinced me to go
into business with you.

36:03.655 --> 36:07.087
That's not exactly how I
remember it happening, but, uh...

36:10.445 --> 36:11.724
So how am I doing, doc?

36:11.782 --> 36:13.945
Well, they were able to remove
all the necrotic tissue,

36:14.048 --> 36:16.622
and you'll make a full recovery,
but you need to be more careful.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.187
Oh, I will. Olivia will make sure.

36:19.281 --> 36:20.143
Good.

36:20.253 --> 36:22.924
Any questions, don't hesitate
to ask your next doctor.

36:23.368 --> 36:24.873
Next doctor?

36:25.233 --> 36:26.653
- What, are you firing me?
- Don't worry.

36:26.731 --> 36:27.845
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

36:27.911 --> 36:30.242
But, yeah, I think it's best we part ways.

36:30.317 --> 36:31.791
Can't we at least discuss it?

36:31.878 --> 36:34.296
Ray, we just did.

36:55.010 --> 36:56.355
You hired the lawyer.

36:58.894 --> 37:00.215
Excuse me?

37:00.298 --> 37:03.117
The one that helped Viviana, you hired her,

37:03.839 --> 37:06.038
because you don't give up on people,

37:06.104 --> 37:07.391
even...

37:07.976 --> 37:10.830
when they're angry at you and
kick you out of their house.

37:10.891 --> 37:13.531
I had to do something to
make up for interfering.

37:16.251 --> 37:17.905
So I interfered some more.

37:20.018 --> 37:23.762
Well, I-I share the blame.
I was being secretive.

37:23.807 --> 37:26.191
I should've just talked to you
about needing more space...

37:26.992 --> 37:28.638
And less noise...

37:28.713 --> 37:30.382
And more sleep...

37:30.804 --> 37:33.634
And less baby things
everywhere around the house.

37:33.681 --> 37:35.283
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.553
And...

37:39.712 --> 37:42.907
I-I should have talked to
you about Viviana too.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.601
I was...

37:47.385 --> 37:48.627
I was afraid I'd feel embarrassed

37:48.687 --> 37:50.386
if things didn't work out with her...

37:52.024 --> 37:53.801
Which maybe they didn't.

37:54.757 --> 37:57.413
And I got so caught up in
my own anxiety as a mother

37:57.472 --> 38:00.416
that I didn't see my need
to protect had taken over.

38:02.431 --> 38:05.047
But you are stronger than
I gave you credit for.

38:11.162 --> 38:13.440
Things won't ever be the same, will they?

38:15.114 --> 38:16.549
Well, things never stay the same.

38:16.588 --> 38:18.094
It's called entropy.

38:18.459 --> 38:19.754
Right.

38:19.824 --> 38:21.094
Right.

38:22.686 --> 38:25.525
But you and me... Are we...

38:48.991 --> 38:50.336
Hey, guys.

38:50.381 --> 38:51.703
What's up?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.544
I don't know, Emma.

38:54.624 --> 38:55.871
What is up?

38:56.318 --> 38:58.887
Uh, is everything okay?

39:01.614 --> 39:05.021
Emma, did you sell that photo
of Cinco and me to Snarkhampton?

39:11.211 --> 39:13.261
uh...

39:16.884 --> 39:18.639
I never meant to hurt you.

39:19.948 --> 39:22.083
I never meant to hurt either one of you.

39:22.532 --> 39:23.745
I was so mad at Cinco,

39:23.813 --> 39:28.640
and so I sent that photo to some of
the people who were at the party,

39:28.696 --> 39:31.681
and one of them must've
sold it to Snarkhampton.

39:31.750 --> 39:33.779
And now everything is this huge mess,

39:33.877 --> 39:36.265
and I don't know how to fix it, and...

39:36.345 --> 39:37.752
Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's gonna be okay.

39:37.802 --> 39:39.260
It's gonna be okay.

39:40.805 --> 39:41.691
Shh.

39:41.782 --> 39:43.619
You don't have to do anything on your own,

39:43.672 --> 39:45.100
not anymore.

39:46.453 --> 39:49.999
Yeah, we're family.
We'll... we'll figure this out.

39:53.077 --> 39:56.720
Thank you both for everything.

39:56.771 --> 39:58.581
While we're here, though, just...

39:58.660 --> 40:01.487
Is there anything else we should know about?

40:03.362 --> 40:04.754
No.

40:05.259 --> 40:06.119
No.

40:07.055 --> 40:08.484
It's all good.

40:08.933 --> 40:10.205
Good.

40:20.213 --> 40:22.706
Okay, so I've got the Henderson
twins' vaccinations at 10:00

40:22.776 --> 40:24.408
and Ms. Newberg's annual physical at noon.

40:24.486 --> 40:26.282
Which, of course, will turn
into a three-Martini lunch.

40:26.369 --> 40:27.372
For her, not for me.

40:27.451 --> 40:29.132
I've got back-to-back patients needing MRIs.

40:29.435 --> 40:30.830
You're lending me your Navy tie, Henry.

40:30.891 --> 40:32.182
No, I'm not. I love that tie.

40:32.257 --> 40:33.573
- And you won't return it.
- Thank you.

40:33.573 --> 40:35.214
You know, sometimes I feel
like you don't listen to me.

40:35.861 --> 40:37.289
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:37.349 --> 40:38.127
Now with Hanklab gone,

40:38.219 --> 40:40.470
are we going to have to plead with the
hospital for more reasonable rates?

40:40.527 --> 40:43.111
No, not yet. I'm actually
working on Hanklab mach II.

40:43.111 --> 40:43.674
Really?

40:43.750 --> 40:45.814
Yeah. I don't want to jinx it by
talking about it too much right now,

40:45.865 --> 40:46.948
but just wish me luck.

40:47.006 --> 40:48.457
- Good luck, Evan.
- Hey.

40:48.523 --> 40:50.003
- I like your tie.
- Oh, thanks.

40:50.076 --> 40:51.955
- It was a gift from Hank.
- No, not.

40:52.733 --> 40:54.112
- Morning, everyone.
- Morning.

40:54.156 --> 40:55.025
Good morning.

40:57.301 --> 40:58.687
Isn't Evan staying for the staff meeting?

40:58.746 --> 41:00.493
No, he's working on Hanklab mach II.

41:00.580 --> 41:03.457
Hey, guys, one of my
prescription pads is missing.

41:03.516 --> 41:04.809
Did either one of you take it?

41:05.524 --> 41:06.989
- No.
- Not me.

41:07.077 --> 41:08.929
Was anyone here while we were in Argentina?

41:08.979 --> 41:10.895
Not that I know of, just Emma.

41:24.260 --> 41:26.002
I'm home now and feeling much better.

41:26.065 --> 41:27.062
Thank you.

41:27.127 --> 41:28.510
It's good to see you again.

41:28.583 --> 41:29.707
You as well.

41:29.765 --> 41:31.271
I wanted you to know that my wife and I

41:31.343 --> 41:33.762
are looking into expanding
the scope of our foundation

41:33.854 --> 41:35.559
to include orphan diseases.

41:35.907 --> 41:36.825
We hope to move quickly,

41:36.883 --> 41:38.488
and as soon as we have,
we'll be in touch, yeah?

41:38.588 --> 41:39.427
Wonderful.

41:39.513 --> 41:42.050
It would be my privilege
to make a contribution.

41:42.148 --> 41:43.885
I look forward to talking with you both.

41:43.970 --> 41:46.005
Take care, Tobias. And
give our best to Jakob.

41:46.275 --> 41:47.484
<i>Adios.</i>

41:47.521 --> 41:48.532
Good morning, Boris.

41:48.793 --> 41:51.396
Mr. Lawson, to what do I owe the pleasure?

41:52.044 --> 41:53.688
Oh, this isn't a social visit.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.777
Certainly not, or I'd invite you to sit.

41:56.975 --> 41:59.523
I have a business proposal
I want to discuss with you.

41:59.982 --> 42:03.077
It's one I think you're gonna
find pretty interesting.

42:04.404 --> 42:05.848
By all means.

42:07.347 --> 42:08.379
Thank you.
