00:01.600 --> 00:04.142
Previously on "Castle"...

00:04.601 --> 00:06.335
He's not in the car!

00:06.370 --> 00:08.504
Esposito: He was found adrift 80
miles off the coast of Delaware

00:08.539 --> 00:09.504
in a dinghy owned by Henry Jenkins.

00:09.539 --> 00:10.706
On the ground!

00:10.740 --> 00:12.174
Put your hands where I can see 'em now,
now!

00:12.208 --> 00:13.175
If you don't know Mr. Castle,

00:13.209 --> 00:14.176
then how did he end up in your boat

00:14.210 --> 00:15.611
in the middle of the ocean?

00:15.645 --> 00:17.145
He's been missing for two months.

00:17.180 --> 00:19.381
See if you can find any
evidence of where he's been.

00:19.415 --> 00:20.916
I did find a key.

00:20.951 --> 00:22.918
It has "38" stamped on it.

00:22.953 --> 00:25.687
NYPD. I'm here to see Henry Jenkins?

00:25.721 --> 00:26.688
I'm Henry Jenkins.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.872
I met a different Henry Jenkins.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.392
Castle: Whoever did this to me

00:30.426 --> 00:32.427
faked Jenkins as part of the setup.

00:32.462 --> 00:35.015
He's somehow in the middle of this.

00:41.604 --> 00:43.738
Moving together. Keep that top down. Quick.

00:46.441 --> 00:48.676
Legs press off that footplate.

00:48.711 --> 00:49.877
Press and set.

00:49.912 --> 00:51.779
Press, set.

00:51.814 --> 00:54.073
Press, set.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.400
Hold water. Hold water.

01:04.543 --> 01:06.513
What is that?

01:06.948 --> 01:09.430
Gruesome murders, chills and thrills...

01:09.464 --> 01:11.832
it's what author Richard
Castle is known for,

01:11.866 --> 01:14.435
and he's delivered yet
again with two new books...

01:14.469 --> 01:16.493
"Wild Storm" and "Raging Heat."

01:16.513 --> 01:17.909
Thank you for joining us this morning.

01:17.929 --> 01:18.731
My pleasure.

01:18.751 --> 01:22.109
But perhaps the bigger mystery
is the one that surrounds you.

01:22.143 --> 01:24.111
Your disappearance made national headlines.

01:24.145 --> 01:27.480
Months later,
you were found in a dinghy at sea,

01:27.515 --> 01:28.815
yet you claim to have no memory

01:28.850 --> 01:30.517
of where you've been or how you got there.

01:30.551 --> 01:33.520
Yeah, I know it, uh...
it sounds crazy, even to me,

01:33.554 --> 01:36.022
and, uh, we're still looking for answers.

01:36.056 --> 01:38.291
Well, your critics seem to have some.

01:38.325 --> 01:40.260
It's no secret your last book,
"Wild Storms,"

01:40.294 --> 01:41.761
slipped off the best-seller list.

01:41.795 --> 01:43.496
Isn't the most logical explanation

01:43.531 --> 01:45.231
that this is all a publicity stunt,

01:45.266 --> 01:48.167
a way to make headlines
to drum up book sales?

01:48.201 --> 01:50.970
I assure you, Brooke,
it was no publicity stunt.

01:51.004 --> 01:53.806
I would never do that to
my family or my fiancee.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.274
Speaking of your fiancee,

01:55.308 --> 01:57.576
you vanished just moments
before your wedding.

01:57.610 --> 01:58.744
What do you say to fans

01:58.779 --> 02:00.980
who chalk your disappearance
up to cold feet?

02:01.740 --> 02:02.581
Well, I would say

02:02.615 --> 02:04.616
that they don't know what
they're talking about.

02:04.651 --> 02:06.017
So the wedding's still on.

02:06.052 --> 02:07.852
Well, we've been through
a very tough experience.

02:07.887 --> 02:10.020
We're still trying to make
sense o-of everything, actually.

02:10.056 --> 02:12.057
And I actually just... I-I...

02:12.091 --> 02:14.393
I came here to talk about my books.

02:14.427 --> 02:16.728
And if this were one of your books,
Mr. Castle,

02:16.762 --> 02:19.331
wouldn't you find the plot
a little hard to swallow?

02:19.365 --> 02:21.966
I mean, amnesia, really?

02:23.522 --> 02:26.237
Well, this isn't a novel, Brooke.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.638
This actually happened.

02:27.673 --> 02:30.742
And no one wants the truth more than I do.

02:32.511 --> 02:35.046
And I can prove it.

02:35.345 --> 02:38.482
I'm offering a reward... $250,000...

02:38.517 --> 02:40.784
to anyone who can give me verifiable proof

02:40.819 --> 02:43.254
as to where I was
and exactly what I was doing

02:43.288 --> 02:45.256
during the two months I was missing.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.091
Beckett: That wasn't an interview.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.392
That was an ambush.

02:48.427 --> 02:51.262
And what were you thinking
offering a quarter-million-dollar reward?

02:51.296 --> 02:53.294
Genius, right? I don't know why
I didn't think of it sooner.

02:53.314 --> 02:57.367
Well, maybe because you knew it was gonna
lure crackpots and opportunists,

02:57.401 --> 02:59.402
and instead of going after real leads,

02:59.437 --> 03:02.239
we're gonna be chasing
thousands of half-baked tipsters

03:02.273 --> 03:04.208
playing the Richard Castle lottery.

03:04.242 --> 03:05.275
What real leads?

03:05.309 --> 03:06.910
So far, we've had nothing but dead ends.

03:06.945 --> 03:08.645
And I'm tired of not knowing.

03:08.679 --> 03:10.247
No, to find a needle in a haystack,

03:10.281 --> 03:11.981
do we not first need a haystack?

03:12.015 --> 03:14.584
Yeah, but not a haystack full of nutjobs.

03:14.619 --> 03:17.019
You saw that interview. No one believes me.

03:17.054 --> 03:18.588
But somewhere out there,

03:18.623 --> 03:21.625
someone knows where I
was and what I was doing.

03:25.095 --> 03:26.829
You ready for this?

03:26.864 --> 03:29.632
A mystery I might be able to solve?

03:29.666 --> 03:31.061
It'll be a relief.

03:31.081 --> 03:33.171
- Hey, Castle. Welcome back.
- Thank you.

03:33.191 --> 03:35.872
I hear the east river's a little
more polluted than usual today.

03:35.906 --> 03:37.673
Yeah. A crew team,

03:37.707 --> 03:40.176
they found the body in the
river wrapped in plastic.

03:40.210 --> 03:42.145
Someone probably dumped it
hoping to make it disappear.

03:42.179 --> 03:43.679
They didn't weigh it down enough.

03:43.713 --> 03:46.146
So, who's the victim?
Ryan: Well, he didn't have an I.D. On him,

03:46.166 --> 03:49.285
but we matched it to a missing-persons.
Wallace Williger, 45,

03:49.319 --> 03:51.086
owner and C.E.O. of Williger toys.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.092
- Makers of Sunshine Sarah?
- Sunshine Sarah?

03:53.112 --> 03:55.143
She's a spunky, redheaded rag doll.

03:55.163 --> 03:56.818
Alexis' favorite when she was growing up.

03:56.838 --> 03:58.794
- Wouldn't go anywhere without her.
- When did he go missing?

03:58.828 --> 04:00.562
Last Friday, so four days ago.

04:00.597 --> 04:03.631
His wife, Samantha, said he went off
to the movies and never came back.

04:05.048 --> 04:05.867
Ooh.

04:05.902 --> 04:07.268
[Laughs]

04:07.592 --> 04:09.537
- Something I should know?
- Oh, Beckett didn't tell you?

04:09.572 --> 04:12.140
Yeah, yeah, your disappearance
kind of drove them back together.

04:12.174 --> 04:13.575
Life being short and all that.

04:13.610 --> 04:16.111
Oh. Disappear for two months.

04:16.652 --> 04:19.613
So, the prelim exam indicates
his neck was broken.

04:19.648 --> 04:21.781
Probably after a struggle
given his defensive wound.

04:21.817 --> 04:24.018
Luckily, his body was wrapped
when it went into the water.

04:24.052 --> 04:26.588
I may still be able to
pull the attacker's DNA

04:26.622 --> 04:28.656
from under the victim's nails.

04:29.057 --> 04:30.650
Beckett: Wait.
How long has he been dead?

04:30.670 --> 04:32.260
At least a couple of days.

04:32.294 --> 04:34.061
What happened to his face and hands?

04:34.096 --> 04:35.529
They look like they've been burned.

04:35.563 --> 04:37.297
Honestly, I don't know,

04:37.332 --> 04:39.066
but the rest of the body wasn't affected.

04:39.101 --> 04:41.618
I'll know more when I
get him back to the lab.

04:44.150 --> 04:47.608
I had that sick feeling when
he didn't come home, but...

04:47.643 --> 04:48.609
You hope.

04:48.644 --> 04:50.877
Mrs. Williger, was there anyone

04:50.911 --> 04:52.741
that would've wanted to
do your husband harm?

04:52.761 --> 04:53.447
No.

04:53.481 --> 04:55.315
He made toys for a living.

04:55.350 --> 04:57.618
He was a decent man.

04:59.124 --> 05:00.120
But...

05:00.155 --> 05:00.936
But what?

05:00.956 --> 05:04.358
These last few weeks,
he had been having a hard time.

05:04.392 --> 05:06.078
Ever since Annie died.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.227
Oh, I'm sorry. Um... who's Annie?

05:08.484 --> 05:10.329
Our labrador retriever.

05:10.364 --> 05:12.966
And after she died,
Wally started working late,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.869
coming home after I was asleep,
like he was avoiding me.

05:15.903 --> 05:17.270
Did you talk to him about it?

05:17.304 --> 05:20.352
I tried. He said everything was fine.

05:20.526 --> 05:22.208
He was just working on
an important project.

05:22.242 --> 05:24.143
And what about the day that he disappeared?

05:24.178 --> 05:26.179
Did he say anything that would
indicate he was in trouble?

05:26.213 --> 05:28.113
No. He was happy.

05:28.148 --> 05:30.616
He told me he loved me,

05:30.651 --> 05:33.852
said things would be... better soon.

05:39.325 --> 05:42.358
You know, seeing her,
I can't imagine what it was like for you

05:42.378 --> 05:44.376
all those nights, not knowing.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.379
I was lucky. You came back.

05:47.399 --> 05:49.401
[Elevator bell dings] Esposito: Hey.

05:49.435 --> 05:50.903
So, we took a look at
Williger's phone and financials.

05:50.937 --> 05:52.270
There was no activity on
the day he disappeared.

05:52.305 --> 05:53.906
If he was on his way to the movies,

05:53.940 --> 05:56.208
either he didn't make it
there or he paid with cash.

05:56.242 --> 05:58.410
Canvass local theaters,
see if anyone saw him.

05:58.444 --> 06:00.478
And take a look at his records
for the past couple of weeks,

06:00.513 --> 06:02.547
see if there's anything
out of the ordinary there.

06:02.582 --> 06:04.015
Castle and I are gonna go to his office

06:04.049 --> 06:05.651
and check if there were any
problems at work.

06:05.671 --> 06:06.432
Right on.

06:06.452 --> 06:07.819
Mr. Castle.

06:08.704 --> 06:11.989
Just what in the hell do
you think you're doing?

06:12.731 --> 06:15.426
Did you give that TV
station the precinct number?

06:15.460 --> 06:17.762
I'm not gonna give them
my home phone. That's private.

06:17.796 --> 06:20.965
The NYPD is not your personal secretary.

06:20.999 --> 06:22.800
Did you know how many man-hours

06:22.835 --> 06:24.936
this little stunt of yours is costing us?

06:24.970 --> 06:27.038
The phones have been ringing off the hook!

06:27.072 --> 06:29.005
Did you hear that?!

06:29.040 --> 06:31.074
Ringing off the hook?

06:34.111 --> 06:36.246
We have leads.

06:39.882 --> 06:41.714
What just happened?

06:42.223 --> 06:43.787
Beckett: Castle, what were you thinking?

06:43.821 --> 06:45.688
Castle: "The supreme art of war

06:45.723 --> 06:47.958
is to subdue the enemy without fighting,"
Sun Tzu.

06:47.992 --> 06:51.561
The tactical smooch is just
one weapon in my vast arsenal.

06:51.595 --> 06:54.931
Well, employ it again,
and the enemy might go nuclear.

06:54.966 --> 06:58.168
Okay, but somewhere in this pile
is the answer to where I was.

06:58.202 --> 06:59.535
I can feel it.

06:59.570 --> 07:02.472
Look, Castle,
I know how important this is to us,

07:02.506 --> 07:05.007
but you have to realize,
this is a long shot,

07:05.041 --> 07:08.010
and I don't want you to be
disappointed if it doesn't pan out.

07:08.044 --> 07:09.211
[Toys beeping]

07:09.246 --> 07:11.147
Toys.

07:14.217 --> 07:15.422
[Sighs]

07:16.601 --> 07:19.155
Stoller:
Wally built this place from the ground up.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.690
Seems impossible that he's gone.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.426
Miss Stoller,
was everything okay here at work?

07:24.460 --> 07:27.797
Did he have any conflicts with
colleagues or business rivals?

07:27.831 --> 07:29.231
Not that I'm aware of.

07:29.266 --> 07:31.733
And as VP of the company,
I'm sure I'd know.

07:31.768 --> 07:34.303
I understand that he was under
pressure the past couple of weeks,

07:34.337 --> 07:36.009
that he was coming home late.

07:36.029 --> 07:38.138
- Who told you that?
- His wife.

07:38.585 --> 07:40.819
I'm sorry, but that's not true.

07:41.067 --> 07:42.877
I mean, he may have been under pressure,

07:42.912 --> 07:44.546
but it certainly wasn't here at work.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.114
So, he wasn't staying late?

07:46.148 --> 07:47.882
No, just the opposite.

07:47.917 --> 07:50.352
He was leaving early several days a week.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.453
[Piano notes play]

07:54.389 --> 07:56.490
I did not realize this would be on.

07:56.525 --> 07:57.826
Sorry.

07:59.829 --> 08:01.796
Do you know why he was leaving early?

08:01.831 --> 08:05.033
No, he said he was taking
care of some personal things.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.468
It sounded private, so I didn't ask.

08:07.502 --> 08:09.337
But maybe he told his assistant.

08:09.371 --> 08:10.705
[Phone beeps]
Matt?

08:14.781 --> 08:16.944
Did Mr. Williger ever mention to you

08:16.978 --> 08:18.813
- why he was leaving early?
- No.

08:18.847 --> 08:21.734
He was actually pretty
secretive about the whole thing.

08:25.457 --> 08:27.762
You leave these loaded?

08:28.147 --> 08:29.689
So, I checked with the Vic's wife.

08:29.724 --> 08:32.025
The days that Mr. Williger
claimed he was working late

08:32.059 --> 08:33.626
are the exact same days
he was leaving work early.

08:33.660 --> 08:34.995
That leaves about 10 to 12 hours

08:35.029 --> 08:37.797
over at least a dozen days
that he's unaccounted for.

08:37.832 --> 08:39.032
What was he doing?

08:39.067 --> 08:41.433
I just went back through
his phones and financials,

08:41.469 --> 08:42.568
and they are clean.

08:42.602 --> 08:44.303
In fact, they're too clean.

08:44.338 --> 08:45.772
From the time he left work on those days

08:45.806 --> 08:47.574
till the time he got home,
there's no activity at all.

08:47.608 --> 08:49.676
No calls or purchases of any kind,

08:49.710 --> 08:51.378
not even subway or cab charges.

08:51.412 --> 08:53.045
So, whatever he was doing,

08:53.080 --> 08:55.948
he wanted to keep it a secret
from everyone. Why?

08:55.983 --> 08:59.618
What we could use right now
is a crazy Castle theory.

09:00.058 --> 09:01.733
Where is Castle, anyway?

09:01.857 --> 09:04.190
He needed a time out,
so I sent him home to check his leads.

09:06.393 --> 09:08.895

09:12.673 --> 09:15.371
- Hola, preciosa. What's up?
- Something weird.

09:15.391 --> 09:18.865
You know that discoloration on
the victim's hands and face?

09:18.885 --> 09:21.707
It was caused by an industrial cleaner.

09:21.741 --> 09:24.142
It looks like someone
scrubbed his skin with it

09:24.176 --> 09:26.077
but after he was already dead.

09:26.112 --> 09:28.246
Wait, Lanie, if the killer is
trying to get rid of evidence,

09:28.281 --> 09:30.481
why would he only scrub the hands and face?

09:30.516 --> 09:33.051
Don't know,
but the cleaner wasn't bleach-based,

09:33.085 --> 09:35.887
so I still may be able to pull
DNA from under the fingernails.

09:35.922 --> 09:38.890
I also found a receipt
in the victim's pocket.

09:38.925 --> 09:40.825
It's from a coffee shop in Brooklyn,

09:40.859 --> 09:42.493
dated the day he disappeared.

09:42.528 --> 09:45.643
Williger lived in Manhattan,
and his office was in midtown.

09:45.663 --> 09:46.731
What was he doing out in Brooklyn?

09:46.765 --> 09:49.333
Why don't you guys canvass the coffee
shop for anyone that saw Williger?

09:49.367 --> 09:52.690
I'll get a search warrant for his office
and house first thing in the morning.

09:56.896 --> 09:57.942
Lanie: Come on, Kate.

09:57.976 --> 09:59.844
It's his first case back after two months.

09:59.878 --> 10:02.647
You didn't expect everything to
be back to normal right away.

10:02.681 --> 10:05.515
No, Lane. It's just...

10:06.429 --> 10:09.053
It's just...
I-I want it to be us again,

10:09.087 --> 10:12.423
and it's like there's
this shadow between us.

10:12.457 --> 10:16.427
Look, I-I am choosing to trust him

10:17.234 --> 10:19.096
in spite of all of the evidence.

10:19.130 --> 10:21.230
I-I just... I want to believe...

10:21.265 --> 10:23.800
- But you don't know if you can.
- Yeah.

10:24.952 --> 10:28.472
And he's...
he's acting like everything is fine.

10:29.159 --> 10:30.974
We both are, but it's... it's not.

10:31.008 --> 10:34.243
Maybe this reward he's
offering is a good thing.

10:34.278 --> 10:36.458
Maybe it'll lead to the truth.

10:38.849 --> 10:40.683
No, I don't want to know what
you're wearing. [Door closes]

10:40.717 --> 10:43.386
Now, do you have any information
about Richard Castle or not?

10:43.420 --> 10:44.420
Thanks. [Sighs]

10:45.606 --> 10:49.225
- So, how goes the haystack?
- Uh, apparently you were right.

10:49.568 --> 10:51.560
- Nutjobs?
- No. Not all of them.

10:51.595 --> 10:53.829
Some are lonely women hoping for a call

10:53.864 --> 10:55.731
from the famous author Richard Castle.

[Doorbell buzzes]

10:57.367 --> 10:58.266
Martha: Aha.

10:58.301 --> 11:00.102
That will be my date.

11:00.136 --> 11:02.872
- Ooh. You have a date?
- Uh-huh. Robert.

11:02.906 --> 11:06.942
We met at the grief counseling
group when you were presumed...

11:06.977 --> 11:08.978
- You picked up a man at grief counseling?
- Yes.

11:09.012 --> 11:11.436
Now, I will thank you
to go into the other room.

11:11.456 --> 11:13.581
- Why?
- Because at the moment,

11:13.616 --> 11:15.884
our relationship is based on mutual loss,

11:15.918 --> 11:18.586
and if he finds out that you
have returned and are alive,

11:18.621 --> 11:20.288
it will just... it will ruin everything.

11:20.323 --> 11:22.624
Mother, you realize I was
on television this morning.

11:22.658 --> 11:24.326
Luckily Robert is a cultured man.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.760
He does not watch television.

11:25.794 --> 11:27.996
The only newspaper he reads
is the Wall Street journal,

11:28.030 --> 11:31.465
which, thankfully,
did not carry news of your return.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.700
So, go.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.611
[Doorbell buzzes] Go. Go. Go.

11:34.631 --> 11:37.138
Castle, I'm sure she means well.

11:37.172 --> 11:39.306
It's not that. It's just, uh...

11:39.499 --> 11:41.809
I really thought
someone out there could help.

11:41.844 --> 11:44.545
We'll figure this out, Castle. Together.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.414
[Cellphone rings]

11:47.044 --> 11:48.152
[Cellphone beeps] Excuse me.

11:48.172 --> 11:49.150
Hello?

11:49.184 --> 11:52.986
Man: Mr. Castle,
I understand you're looking for answers.

11:53.021 --> 11:55.374
Who is this?
How did you get this number?

11:55.394 --> 11:57.782
Because I know things,

11:57.802 --> 11:59.893
including what happened to you.

I don't like this. I should go with you.

12:15.923 --> 12:17.478
Castle: He said I had to come alone.

12:17.512 --> 12:19.247
Yeah, but you don't even know who he is.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.782
He sounded like a spy.

12:21.817 --> 12:23.984
Do you think this has something
to do with your father?

12:24.018 --> 12:25.689
It doesn't seem like his style.

13:20.811 --> 13:22.508
The less you know, the better.

13:22.542 --> 13:25.244
But you know
what happened to me. How?

13:25.278 --> 13:27.321
Because I was with you.

13:27.991 --> 13:31.962
I don't expect you to remember,
not after what they did.

13:32.123 --> 13:34.168
I was lucky I escaped.

13:34.329 --> 13:36.121
Escape from where?

13:36.155 --> 13:38.156
The ship.

13:38.190 --> 13:40.225
I was on a ship.

13:40.472 --> 13:42.561
Which is why I was found at sea.

13:42.595 --> 13:43.795
Whose ship?

13:43.830 --> 13:45.430
It's a survey vessel.

13:45.464 --> 13:48.133
At least that's what they claimed.

13:48.167 --> 13:49.967
But I saw weapons on board.

13:50.002 --> 13:53.604
- Pretty sure it was an attack ship.
- An attack...

13:53.966 --> 13:57.208
- So it was military.
- Must have been.

13:58.706 --> 14:00.978
I mean, why else would they keep it

14:01.013 --> 14:02.647
on the dark side of the moon

Excuse me?

14:07.152 --> 14:09.399
You know, they look like us now.

14:09.759 --> 14:12.911
That's why they took you.
To copy your skin.

14:13.618 --> 14:17.633
So, when you say ship, you mean...
Spaceship?

14:17.653 --> 14:21.331
We'll be defenseless
when the invasion comes.

14:21.366 --> 14:24.368
We have to find a way to warn people.

14:25.005 --> 14:26.551
You can tell people.

14:26.571 --> 14:30.187
- You were on TV.
- No, I'll... I'll warn them. I'll, uh...

14:30.207 --> 14:32.443
Tell me again.
How did you get my phone number?

14:32.477 --> 14:35.406
- I work for the phone company.
- Of course you do.

14:40.908 --> 14:42.906
So, what happened?

14:43.229 --> 14:45.661
I really don't want to talk about it.

- Sorry.

14:55.689 --> 14:57.567
I don't know how my parents did it.

14:57.601 --> 14:58.934
Did what?

14:58.969 --> 15:01.770
Raise me, all my sisters,
put food on the table,

15:01.805 --> 15:03.439
and still manage to give me piano lessons.

indication of any dirty, little secr...

there's something in this drawer.

15:31.601 --> 15:32.834

during that unaccounted time

15:42.711 --> 15:45.713
and all made to the same number,
a Natalie Mendoza, 28.

What's her relation to Williger?

15:47.149 --> 15:49.183
- We're still running background.
- I may have a guess.

15:49.217 --> 15:51.653
Wally's wife said that his behavior
changed after their dog died.

15:51.687 --> 15:52.920
I checked with the vet.

15:52.955 --> 15:54.956
Turns out, there's
a whole lot more to that story.

15:54.990 --> 15:57.057
Now, Wally asked the vet to
keep it out of the report

15:57.091 --> 15:59.760
so as not to upset his wife,
but the dog didn't just die.

15:59.794 --> 16:02.062
- She was poisoned.
- Poisoned?

16:02.096 --> 16:04.898
Yes, the vet wanted to run a test
to find out what the toxin was,

16:04.932 --> 16:07.434
but for some reason,
Wally adamantly refused.

16:07.469 --> 16:08.869
Vet said he seemed
pretty shaken up about it.

started missing work...

Wally Williger.
He's the CEO of Williger Toys.

17:40.582 --> 17:42.226
I'm sorry. I don't know who that is.

17:42.261 --> 17:43.527
Natalie, please don't lie to us.

- I'm not lying.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.502
The more you deny it,
the guiltier you look.

17:51.536 --> 17:52.870
The guiltier I look for what?

17:52.904 --> 17:54.972
Look, I told you. I don't know him.

17:55.006 --> 17:58.475
But why... was he calling you?

18:01.178 --> 18:03.046
Wait. That's Wally?

18:03.081 --> 18:04.915
- So you do know him?
- Yeah.

18:04.949 --> 18:07.350
But he told me his name was Joe.

Joe Meyers.

18:08.719 --> 18:10.787
And what exactly was your
relationship with Joe?

18:10.821 --> 18:13.523
He hired me to teach him
to use theatrical makeup.

18:13.557 --> 18:15.925
Why would he need to use theatrical makeup?

18:15.959 --> 18:18.094
Uh, for a research project he was doing.

18:18.128 --> 18:19.296
He wanted me to teach him

18:19.330 --> 18:21.931
how to completely change his appearance.

18:21.965 --> 18:23.333
To what?

18:23.367 --> 18:26.833
Um, he said he was studying
society's reaction to aging

18:26.853 --> 18:29.910
and wanted my help to transform him

18:29.930 --> 18:32.909
in... into a 70-year-old man.

18:37.114 --> 18:40.116

None of this makes any sense.

but Natalie said she only taught Wally

how to apply the makeup
to his hands and face.

18:47.921 --> 18:49.917
The same parts of the
body the killer scrubbed.

18:49.937 --> 18:51.760
- He was trying to remove the makeup.
- Right.

18:51.794 --> 18:53.262
So Wally's murder

18:53.296 --> 18:55.063
is connected to his
secret identity somehow.

18:55.098 --> 18:57.566
You know that receipt that
was in Wally's pocket,

18:57.601 --> 18:59.835

18:59.869 --> 19:01.069

19:01.104 --> 19:03.438
This morning, but they got no hits.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.762
You know what?
Have them canvass it again.

About six weeks ago,
we were on our honeymoon.

We just started going through the
photos the last couple of days.

19:21.557 --> 19:24.159
Mike took pictures of
me everywhere we went.

That is me.

19:36.538 --> 19:38.410
Who am I talking to?

19:40.142 --> 19:43.977
Castle, that's the guy from the trailer
on the Massachusetts coast,

19:43.997 --> 19:46.580
the one that lied about
you and then disappeared.

19:46.614 --> 19:48.080
Where was this photo taken?

19:48.100 --> 19:49.316

19:49.350 --> 19:50.817
Montreal.

19:52.236 --> 19:54.631
What the hell was I doing in Montreal?

19:56.777 --> 20:00.158
So, according to the jpeg's geotag,

20:00.178 --> 20:02.098
the photo was taken here,

20:02.118 --> 20:05.498
and this is the building
you were coming out of.

20:05.518 --> 20:07.516
Montreal Global Bank.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.432
What was I doing at a bank?

20:12.108 --> 20:14.149
Dad, the key!

20:14.583 --> 20:17.003
The one sewn into your pants...

20:17.586 --> 20:19.465
when they found you.

20:19.485 --> 20:24.148
What if... the bank is where it came from?

20:24.168 --> 20:26.685
- A safe deposit box.
- It's the right size.

20:26.705 --> 20:27.838
We need to get up there.

20:27.872 --> 20:30.125
This is the break we've been waiting for.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.209
Okay, fine. We'll go this weekend.

20:32.243 --> 20:33.677
We can't wait for the weekend.
We got to go now.

20:33.712 --> 20:35.679
- I'm in the middle of a case.
- Fine. I'll go.

20:35.714 --> 20:37.014
Montreal's a short flight.

20:37.048 --> 20:38.716
- I'll be there and back a couple of hours.
- No!

20:38.750 --> 20:40.584
Not after everything we've been through.

20:40.618 --> 20:41.651
You're not going alone.

20:41.686 --> 20:43.778
She's right, dad. You can't go by yourself.

20:45.664 --> 20:47.158
I'll go with you.

20:47.178 --> 20:48.525
Yes.

20:48.559 --> 20:49.926
Yes. She'll go with me.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.628
We have no idea what's out there,

20:51.662 --> 20:54.316
no idea who's out there.
That's too risky.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.766
It's Canada. How risky could it be?

20:56.800 --> 20:58.667
And need I remind you, I'm a grown man.

20:58.702 --> 21:00.203
I don't need to ask your permission.

21:00.237 --> 21:03.519
That being said, please, please, can I...
can I... can I go?

21:04.797 --> 21:06.042
Okay, fine.

21:06.076 --> 21:07.343
But only because I know

21:07.377 --> 21:09.946
you're not gonna do anything
stupid if she's with you.

21:09.980 --> 21:12.143
- Don't let him do anything stupid.
- Promise.

21:12.163 --> 21:14.054
Grab your passport. I'll get the tickets.

21:14.074 --> 21:15.251
[Cellphone rings]

21:16.516 --> 21:17.553
Beckett.

21:17.587 --> 21:19.788
Hey, so uniforms re-canvassed
at that coffee shop

21:19.822 --> 21:21.290
using the geezer photo.

21:21.324 --> 21:22.291
They got a hit.

21:22.325 --> 21:23.959
A patron identified old-man Wally

21:23.993 --> 21:25.327
as a tenant at a nearby building.

21:25.362 --> 21:27.028
Okay. I'll be right there.

21:29.298 --> 21:31.780
Now we know what Wally's keys were to.

21:35.701 --> 21:37.546
How long has he had this place?

21:37.566 --> 21:39.705
Super said he rented it three weeks ago.

21:39.725 --> 21:41.777
Paid cash.
At least the old-man version of him did.

21:41.811 --> 21:44.212
Yeah,
this is obviously where he came to change.

21:44.247 --> 21:47.054
- Yeah. But to do what?
- Have CSU sweep the room.

21:47.074 --> 21:48.816
Let's talk to neighbors,
see if they saw anything.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.084
[Clatter]

21:57.926 --> 22:00.395
[Dog barks]

22:08.744 --> 22:10.797
Alexis: That's it...
the building in the photo.

22:10.817 --> 22:12.832
Any of it look familiar?

22:12.852 --> 22:13.841
No.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.128
You really think the answer's inside?

22:16.413 --> 22:18.245
Only one way to find out.

22:18.280 --> 22:20.314
Dad, where are you going?

22:20.348 --> 22:22.059
Open box number 38.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.284
You can't just walk into
a safe deposit room.

22:24.318 --> 22:26.820
You need account info, signature cards.

22:26.854 --> 22:29.189
We don't even know
if that key came from here.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.224
I have a plan.

22:31.258 --> 22:32.959
Dad.

22:33.698 --> 22:35.862
Hi, there.
I wonder if you can help me.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.140
I'd like to rent a safe deposit box.

22:39.499 --> 22:42.201
So, the neighbor doesn't
remember any visitors

22:42.235 --> 22:43.936
and she never saw young Wally,

22:43.970 --> 22:46.839
but old Wally was paying her
to walk and feed the dog.

22:46.873 --> 22:49.274
Another apartment, another dog,
dressing up like this.

22:49.309 --> 22:50.476
What was this guy doing?

22:50.510 --> 22:52.545
I don't know, but whatever it was,
it got him killed.

22:52.579 --> 22:53.946
Why don't you take him to the vet?

22:53.980 --> 22:56.309
Maybe he's got a microchip that
will tell us where he came from.

22:56.329 --> 22:58.884
- Right on.
- Hey, Beckett.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.519
Looks like our old man
was fond of Chinese food.

23:01.554 --> 23:04.723
This is from a restaurant half
a dozen subway stops away.

23:04.757 --> 23:05.924
That's a long way to go for takeout.

23:05.959 --> 23:07.759
Yeah, so I called over there.

23:07.793 --> 23:11.629
Turns out old-man Wally was a
regular the last several weeks,

23:11.664 --> 23:13.765
stopping by late every other night,
always paying cash.

23:13.799 --> 23:16.534
So, wherever he was going,
it was near that restaurant.

23:18.388 --> 23:19.971
Man: Here you go, Mr. Castle.

23:20.005 --> 23:21.840
- Box 115.
- Thank you.

23:21.874 --> 23:23.775
And may I ask you something?

23:23.809 --> 23:25.899
Do I look familiar to you?

23:27.545 --> 23:30.482
Uh, no, I don't believe so. Have we met?

23:30.502 --> 23:32.250
I guess not. My mistake.

23:32.284 --> 23:34.418
Is it possible to access this box today?

23:35.912 --> 23:36.934
Of course.

23:36.954 --> 23:39.813
George, would please take Mr. Castle

23:39.833 --> 23:41.774
back to the safe deposit vault?

23:41.794 --> 23:43.466
Follow me, sir.

23:52.970 --> 23:54.304
Thank you.

24:00.111 --> 24:03.246
- Which box, sir?
- 38.

24:05.979 --> 24:08.952
If it's not the right key,
we'll get caught.

24:11.625 --> 24:12.524
Sir?

24:12.544 --> 24:13.990
Ah.

24:14.025 --> 24:15.358
Here we are.

24:17.294 --> 24:19.128
Ooh.

24:20.831 --> 24:23.466
- Is there a problem?
- No. No problem.

24:23.486 --> 24:25.267
Just a little sticky.

24:25.302 --> 24:26.502
Are you sure you have the right box?

24:26.537 --> 24:27.974
Yep. Positive.

24:32.007 --> 24:33.695
I'll just check with the manager.

24:34.210 --> 24:36.511
Wait, wait.
Let's try one more time.

24:39.916 --> 24:41.636
A little...

24:43.200 --> 24:46.178
There we go.
It was just a little sticky.

24:51.818 --> 24:53.361
- What do you think's inside?
- I don't know.

24:53.395 --> 24:56.645
But someone went to a lot of
trouble to make sure I had a key.

24:56.993 --> 24:58.433
You ready?

25:03.318 --> 25:06.441
Dad, that's your handwriting.

25:06.805 --> 25:09.277
Yeah, I don't remember writing those.

25:09.857 --> 25:14.082
They're letters addressed to Beckett,
gram, and me.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.365
A memory card?

25:25.920 --> 25:29.444
All right. Here's the restaurant.

25:30.089 --> 25:32.700
I'll start a canvass,
see if anyone else around here knows

25:32.720 --> 25:34.398
what the hell our victim
was doing in the area.

25:34.418 --> 25:36.271
Don't bother.

25:36.291 --> 25:39.009
I think I know where he was coming from.

25:40.708 --> 25:42.709
[Forklift beeps]
Excuse me. Can I help you?

25:42.743 --> 25:45.545
Yes. I'm Detective Beckett.
This is Detective Ryan.

25:45.579 --> 25:49.149
- Do you recognize this man?
- Yeah. That's Joe.

25:49.183 --> 25:52.142
- Exactly how do you know him?
- He's a janitor here.

25:52.162 --> 25:54.835
I hired him part time two weeks ago.

25:54.855 --> 25:56.355
- Man: Hey, Mac.
- Yeah?

25:56.390 --> 25:58.199
Excuse me one second.

25:58.583 --> 25:59.993
Ryan.

26:00.867 --> 26:02.795
That's why he made himself up.

26:02.830 --> 26:05.899
He didn't want his
employees to recognize him.

26:06.583 --> 26:07.953
Ryan: What's a C.E.O. of a company

26:07.973 --> 26:10.236
doing working as a janitor
in his own warehouse?

26:10.270 --> 26:12.341
It's undercover boss.

26:13.011 --> 26:15.828
But what was he going undercover for?

26:18.222 --> 26:21.630
He was a quiet guy.
He kept to himself mostly.

26:21.650 --> 26:24.840
I never would have
guessed he was the C.E.O.

26:24.860 --> 26:27.128
- Was he working here last Friday?
- Yeah.

26:27.162 --> 26:28.863
In fact, he came in for his shift at 4:00.

26:28.898 --> 26:30.097
He left at 11:00.

26:30.132 --> 26:31.533
And then on Monday, he didn't show.

26:31.567 --> 26:33.200
Did anything unusual happen that day?

26:33.235 --> 26:35.669
- I don't think so.
- Well, were there any problems here,

26:35.703 --> 26:38.474
any reason that Mr. Williger
would want to go undercover?

26:38.494 --> 26:41.542
No. He and his team came in last month
for their quarterly inspection,

26:41.576 --> 26:43.510
and we got a glowing report.

26:43.545 --> 26:45.813
Well, how about when he
was here as a janitor?

26:45.847 --> 26:48.149
Did he do or say anything
out of the ordinary?

26:48.183 --> 26:50.150
There was that thing last week.

26:50.184 --> 26:51.685
Ah. What thing?

26:51.719 --> 26:55.188
One of the guards caught him
in the back office after hours

26:55.222 --> 26:56.657
riffling through some paperwork.

26:56.691 --> 26:57.658
What kind of paperwork?

26:57.692 --> 26:58.959
Manifests mostly,

26:58.993 --> 27:00.694
tracking shipments from our factories.

27:00.728 --> 27:02.062
The guard admonished him.

27:02.096 --> 27:03.831
He apologized. Everybody moved on.

27:03.865 --> 27:05.865
Well, we need to see those manifests.

27:06.686 --> 27:09.069
Beckett: I talked to his wife,
his colleagues.

27:09.103 --> 27:11.838
If any of them know what Wally
was doing around his warehouse,

27:11.872 --> 27:13.406
they're not admitting to it.

27:13.441 --> 27:14.907
How about you? What'd you find?

27:14.942 --> 27:16.709
Aside from our country outsourcing

27:16.743 --> 27:18.111
all its manufacturing needs to Asia,

27:18.145 --> 27:20.275
everything seems to be in order.

27:20.721 --> 27:23.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down.

27:23.228 --> 27:24.684
- How'd it go?
- Struck out.

27:24.718 --> 27:26.085
Rover here didn't have a microchip,

27:26.119 --> 27:27.720
so we still don't know where he came from,

27:27.754 --> 27:29.221
but the vet said he's in perfect health.

27:29.255 --> 27:31.891
You know what I don't get?
Why did he have a dog?

27:31.925 --> 27:33.960
I mean, was it part of his cover,

27:33.994 --> 27:36.285
or did it have something to
do with his own dog's death?

27:36.305 --> 27:37.363
We're missing something,

27:37.397 --> 27:39.365
something that makes
all of this make sense.

27:39.399 --> 27:42.234
Ryan, can you look into security
and street-camera footage

27:42.268 --> 27:44.603
around Wally's warehouse the
night that he disappeared?

27:44.637 --> 27:45.770
I want to find out where he went.

27:45.805 --> 27:48.073
Right. Come on, boy.

27:50.621 --> 27:51.899
Kate.

27:52.854 --> 27:54.331
Castle?

28:00.573 --> 28:01.586
A memory card.

28:01.621 --> 28:03.955
Yeah, there were three of them
in three separate envelopes...

28:03.990 --> 28:07.011
one for Alexis, one for my mother,
and one for you.

28:07.031 --> 28:08.533
What's on it?

28:14.268 --> 28:15.645
Watch.

28:24.155 --> 28:26.811
Kate, if you're seeing this...

28:27.940 --> 28:30.558
Well, if you're seeing this,
I'm probably dead.

28:31.092 --> 28:34.316
I-I want you to know,
I never intended to leave you,

28:34.351 --> 28:36.953
not like this, not on our wedding day,

28:36.987 --> 28:39.255
but I-it wasn't my choice.

28:40.704 --> 28:44.005
I wish I could tell you what's going on.

28:44.477 --> 28:46.562
I... wish I could explain.

28:47.554 --> 28:50.123
But just know that I love you.

28:51.501 --> 28:54.203
I've always loved you.

28:54.703 --> 28:55.804
Always.

29:02.683 --> 29:06.863
The ones to Alexis and my mother
were pretty much the same.

29:08.172 --> 29:09.317
Kate, what did I do?

29:09.351 --> 29:11.519
Mm. I don't know.

29:12.889 --> 29:14.790
I don't.

29:17.461 --> 29:19.828
But maybe there's a way we can find out.

29:20.973 --> 29:22.764
Ellis: There's no metadata on the file,

29:22.799 --> 29:24.783
and it wasn't geotagged.

29:25.106 --> 29:27.054
Is there any other way to
find out where this was taken?

29:27.074 --> 29:28.403
Maybe there's something in the room

29:28.437 --> 29:30.231
or something in the audio.

29:30.251 --> 29:31.976
[Computer keys clacking] [Sighs]

29:32.534 --> 29:36.187
The recording's low quality,
so there's not much to go on,

29:36.207 --> 29:38.440
but I'll see what I can dig up.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.818
It's weird.

29:45.176 --> 29:46.669
Before I saw that,

29:46.689 --> 29:49.156
all I wanted to know was where
I was and what I was doing.

29:49.190 --> 29:51.354
Now I am not so sure.

30:00.435 --> 30:02.803
Any news on your undercover boss?

30:02.837 --> 30:05.947
Every answer just leads to more questions.

30:06.641 --> 30:09.242
I have no idea what he was
doing at that warehouse

30:09.276 --> 30:11.611
or what this guy was doing with him.

30:12.613 --> 30:13.674
Actually, I was kind of hoping

30:13.694 --> 30:15.862
that you might be able
to help me with a crazy theory.

30:15.882 --> 30:18.151
Sorry. I'm fresh out. How about a kiss?

30:18.185 --> 30:19.819
Even better. [Chuckles]

30:19.853 --> 30:21.620
[Dog barks]

30:21.861 --> 30:24.857
You think he was a nun in a previous life?

30:24.891 --> 30:26.465
[Barking continues]

30:30.730 --> 30:33.098
[Barking continues]

30:35.738 --> 30:37.624
Detective, what do you have in your pocket?

30:37.644 --> 30:40.372
Evidence... from a bust.

30:40.987 --> 30:42.501
The girl was dealing.

30:42.521 --> 30:45.644
So he's not just a dog.
He's a trained drug dog.

30:45.679 --> 30:48.304
I think I have a crazy theory for you.

30:50.299 --> 30:52.143
That's what you think Wally was up to?

30:52.163 --> 30:54.427
Well,
that is the craziest story I've ever heard.

30:54.447 --> 30:55.854
I admit it's crazy,

30:55.874 --> 30:58.187
but it's the only story
that matches all the facts.

30:58.207 --> 30:59.153
Castle's right.

30:59.173 --> 31:01.173
Even if he is, it's still just a story.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.110
We don't have any proof. [Dog barks]

I think I know how we can find some.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.794
Uh, if you don't mind,
I'd like to stay here for a while.

31:15.814 --> 31:18.234
Okay. I'll be back soon.

Come on, guys.

31:27.267 --> 31:28.819
Any luck?

31:28.839 --> 31:31.203
I know this much. You were in a city.

31:31.238 --> 31:32.938
- How can you tell?
- Out the window.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.081
- So, do you know where this is?
- No.

31:43.115 --> 31:44.750
But this view out the window,

31:44.784 --> 31:46.952
the configuration of
buildings ought to be unique.

31:46.986 --> 31:48.119
So you can find it?

31:48.154 --> 31:50.889
Theoretically, but comparing this data set

31:50.924 --> 31:53.458
to global 3D mapping would take forever

31:53.492 --> 31:55.193
and more computing power than I have.

31:55.227 --> 31:57.996
What if we narrowed it to just one city?

31:58.016 --> 31:59.264
Montreal? Could you do it then?

31:59.298 --> 32:01.766
I don't know. Best I can do is try.

[Computer keys clacking]

That's fine, Matt.

We were just going over the company's

Has there been any progress
in the investigation?

33:51.239 --> 33:52.306
Beckett: Yes, there has.

33:52.340 --> 33:54.175
We know why your husband was killed,

Yeah, a month ago, your husband

33:59.414 --> 34:02.349
went to the company warehouse in Brooklyn.

34:02.384 --> 34:04.218
We believe that while he was there,

34:04.252 --> 34:06.087
he picked up a Sunshine Sarah doll

34:06.121 --> 34:07.721
to use as a chew toy for Annie.

34:07.755 --> 34:09.989
Yes, she loved those dolls.
Except this one killed her.

34:10.024 --> 34:11.757
What are you talking about?

34:11.793 --> 34:12.793
There were drugs inside of it.

34:12.827 --> 34:15.728
- That's impossible.
- That's most likely what Wally thought

34:15.763 --> 34:17.063
and why he started wearing disguises,

34:17.098 --> 34:18.364
leaving early, and coming home late.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.400
He went back to the warehouse day after day

34:20.435 --> 34:22.436
trying to figure out what had happened

34:22.469 --> 34:24.670
until he got too close
and they had him killed.

34:24.706 --> 34:25.620
Who had him killed?

34:25.639 --> 34:27.610
The drug ring
running out of your warehouse.

34:27.630 --> 34:30.610
They were smuggling heroin
into the country from China

34:30.643 --> 34:31.978
inside of those dolls.

34:32.013 --> 34:33.980
Miss Stoller, we talked to your foreman.

34:34.014 --> 34:35.815
He told us how the night
shift would remove the drugs

34:35.850 --> 34:38.051
from the dolls before returning
them to the inventory.

34:38.085 --> 34:40.719
There's no way our warehouse
employees could pull that off.

All of those shipments
are coordinated from here.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.190
Yes. From this office.

34:45.226 --> 34:46.991
Which means whoever was in charge of it

34:47.025 --> 34:51.053
had to have had access
to Mr. Williger's files.

Before he joined the company,
he was living over in Asia.

35:03.109 --> 35:05.509
In fact, that's one of
the reasons Williger hired you,

35:05.544 --> 35:07.478
your familiarity with local cultures.

35:07.512 --> 35:09.247
Beckett: I guess Mr. Williger wasn't aware

35:09.281 --> 35:12.050
that familiarity
extended to their heroin trade.

35:12.084 --> 35:13.818
The foreman said you were
behind the whole operation.

that Mr. Williger disappeared.

if Wally knew something was wrong,

He didn't know who he could trust,

35:53.457 --> 35:55.124
and he couldn't go to the
authorities because...

Because our company name would become
synonymous with drug smuggling.

want to remember it anymore.

And as much as we wanted
to know the answers,

if you decided that,
then there had to have been a reason.

40:35.385 --> 40:38.661

them to make me forget.
