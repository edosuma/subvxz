It's your special
birthday breakfast.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.033
Oatmeal?

00:41.075 --> 00:42.368
That's a muffin. Oh.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.936
Didn't bake all the way through.

00:43.978 --> 00:45.871
Still good, though.
It's made with love.

00:45.913 --> 00:48.140
And no flour, by accident. Mm.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.708
Mom's not a baker, Dad.

Well, we don't have to do
anything special.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.789
I'm happy just having
my muffin soup

01:03.831 --> 01:05.391
and reading the newspaper.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.059
Can't we have one place
in this house

01:07.101 --> 01:08.327
that's safe from reading?!

01:08.369 --> 01:09.328
Oh, my God.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.529
What? What is it?

01:10.571 --> 01:11.797
The planetarium is having

01:11.839 --> 01:13.665
its last ever
rock and roll laser show.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.000
And it's happening tonight.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.402
Guys, it's Dad's birthday,

01:16.444 --> 01:18.370
so let's pretend we all know
what he's talking about.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.972
A laser light show, Tina,

01:20.014 --> 01:22.141
is when they take
a classic rock and roll album

01:22.183 --> 01:23.876
and bring it to life
with lasers.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.879
And they're doing the best one:
<i>General Inzanity</i> by Zentipede.

01:26.921 --> 01:29.148
I went to that
a couple times as a kid.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.849
I was a little bit into it.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.317
Yeah!
(rock music playing loudly)

01:32.359 --> 01:33.919
This is amazing!

01:33.961 --> 01:35.921
I can't believe
this is the last one.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.756
Why are they ending it?
I don't know.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.525
I mean, the music's kind of old.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.026
And the lasers are kind of old.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.728
The people who like it
are mostly kind of...

01:42.770 --> 01:44.997
Old? I was gonna say cool.

01:45.039 --> 01:47.599
Hey, maybe we could go to this,
for my birthday.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.601
Yeah. Great idea.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.036
Right, kids?

01:51.078 --> 01:54.039
Sure. Sure. Sure. Yes?

01:54.081 --> 01:56.241
Sounds like you guys
aren't interested.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.543
No. What?

01:57.585 --> 01:59.845
I am.
Going out, watching lasers.

01:59.887 --> 02:02.581
It's what I always imagined
Future Gene would be into.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.450
Hey, you two can go together.

02:04.492 --> 02:07.252
Yes, this one has Dad and Gene
written all over it.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.954
That would be fun. Gene?

02:08.996 --> 02:10.222
Let's do it.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.057
And while the boys are away,

02:12.099 --> 02:14.093
maybe us girls
can have dinner with Gretchen.

02:14.135 --> 02:15.861
She's been bugging me
to hang out.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.230
Sure. I like Gretchen.
She's your friend who swears.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.899
She's a cool sassy "B"
who don't take "S" from anyone.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.569
Oh, my God. This muffin is...
That's really bad.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.537
I wasn't awake yet!
I hadn't had coffee!

02:25.579 --> 02:27.139
Zentipede laser light show.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.440
I can't believe it.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.209
Gene, it's gonna be so much fun.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.711
You keep saying "Zentipede"
like it's a real thing.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.446
Zentipede is the band.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.915
I brought their <i> General</i>
<i>Inzanity</i> album on CD.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.417
I-I could play it for you.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.651
Sure. Or wait, wait, wait.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.487
Maybe you shouldn't
know too much going in.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.555
I-I think it'll be
better that way.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.890
Like the Iraq war.

02:44.932 --> 02:45.998
Sort of.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.595
Gretchen works at the mall now?
I thought she did hair.

02:49.637 --> 02:53.065
She does. She's working at
some salon called Special Girl.

02:53.107 --> 02:56.001
Uh, I don't think
this is a salon.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.903
(gasps) So many dollies!

02:57.945 --> 02:59.304
This is intense.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.806
Are there enough girly girls
in the world

03:00.848 --> 03:02.274
to support a place like this?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.076
(Tina groans)

03:04.118 --> 03:06.078
Tina, what's wrong, sweetie?

03:06.120 --> 03:07.813
I think they're creepy.
I mean...

03:07.855 --> 03:09.114
(whispers):
I think they're creepy.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.282
I think they're sweet.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.084
Ooh! Look at that one.

03:12.126 --> 03:14.153
What pretty eyes.
Like Donna Mills.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.321
(groans)
I don't really like her eyes.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.956
(growling): Do you like my eyes?

03:17.998 --> 03:19.925
(screams) Louise!
She doesn't like my eyes!

03:19.967 --> 03:21.160
Stop it. I know that's you.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.528
Hey, look, there's Gretchen.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.863
What do you know,
she <i> is</i> doing hair.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.765
Hey, Gretch. Hey, Linda.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.133
Excuse me a second.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.835
I'm supposed to talk to
them like they're real

03:29.877 --> 03:31.336
or my manager gets in my face.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.838
You want a magazine
or something?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.106
Okay, whatever.

03:34.148 --> 03:36.308
This place is a scream.
I love it.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.511
Gretchen, do you miss working
with, like, real live people?

03:39.553 --> 03:41.113
Ah, screw live people.

03:41.155 --> 03:42.848
Most of 'em tip worse
than the dolls.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.216
(laughs)

03:44.258 --> 03:46.051
You get it. Anyway,

03:46.093 --> 03:47.886
I thought we could use
my employee discount

03:47.928 --> 03:50.389
in the Special Girl restaurant.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.457
(gasps)
There's a restaurant here, too?

03:52.499 --> 03:53.859
The next time I complain

03:53.901 --> 03:56.461
that <i> our</i> restaurant is sad,
remind me about this.

03:56.503 --> 03:59.231
Let me just finish giving
this little lady a blowout.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.533
She's going to an incredibly
important sleepover

04:01.575 --> 04:02.734
this weekend. Right?

04:02.776 --> 04:03.969
Mm-hmm. Huge.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.304
All right. Settle down.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.172
BOB: <i>There she is, Gene.</i>

04:07.214 --> 04:08.207
The planetarium.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.008
So this place was
your only friend, huh?

04:10.050 --> 04:11.376
Basically. Hmm.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.644
Looks like they're
renovating it.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.146
What's that smell?

04:14.188 --> 04:16.014
It's like a skunk is smoking.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.916
That's, uh, probably what it is.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Big man.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.886
Sold out show. You got tix?

04:20.928 --> 04:23.689
Not anymore. I use a spray
and a medicated collar

04:23.731 --> 04:25.524
and I stay out of tall grass.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.893
Uh, Gene, he's selling tickets.
He's a scalper.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.261
Uh, w-we're good, thanks.

04:29.303 --> 04:30.762
I've also got, uh, tube socks.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.165
And, uh, slap bracelets? Ouch.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.533
Uh, we're, uh... No, thanks.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.767
Come on, Gene, let's go.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.603
Or you can wear 'em as a choker.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.605
Ouch.
You're really hurting yourself.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.440
Uh, we're gonna pass. Thanks.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.674
Any bags?

04:42.716 --> 04:43.675
Just this old bag.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.077
(chuckles) Gene.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.179
No ins and outs. No
exceptions. Understand?

04:47.221 --> 04:49.348
Got it. Come on, buddy.
We're doing this.

04:49.390 --> 04:53.518
(whoops) I've got the
need for Zentipede!

04:53.560 --> 04:55.687
(gasps) It's adorable!

04:55.729 --> 04:57.122
Oh, my God.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.523
Yep, and they serve alcohol.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.791
I know you were
wondering, Linda.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.426
Yeah. Yeah, I was. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.694
(chuckles) Yeah. Welcome.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.029
Did you bring dolls
this evening,

05:04.071 --> 05:06.198
or will you be needing
one of our dinner dolls?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.467
What are dinner dolls?
You need a doll to eat here.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.469
Like some restaurants
say "Jacket required"

05:10.511 --> 05:12.638
or "Ma'am, that bathing
suit needs a bottom."

05:12.680 --> 05:15.374
Oh, so we get to eat
with our very own dolly.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.309
(groans)

05:17.351 --> 05:19.544
Seriously? Is this a joke?

05:19.586 --> 05:22.047
Not at all. But you know
who likes funny jokes?

05:22.089 --> 05:24.816
Jillian! Her daddy's
a circus clown in 1903,

05:24.858 --> 05:26.485
and she wants to be
just like him.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.153
Get it out of my face.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.154
Yeah, no clowns.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.322
Okay. How about you?

05:30.364 --> 05:31.623
(screams) Okay.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.659
Yeah, all the dolls
come with a story like that.

05:33.701 --> 05:34.960
Come on, just pick one.
I'm starving.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.261
Can I get some bread sticks?

05:36.303 --> 05:37.936
Is that going back
to the kitchen?

05:39.439 --> 05:40.832
Aren't these seats great?

05:40.874 --> 05:42.801
Wine me, dine me and recline me.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.002
(electronic music
begins playing)

05:44.044 --> 05:46.004
Gene, here we go.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.573
GENE: Fog machines?
This is promising!

05:48.615 --> 05:50.242
See you on the
other side, buddy.

05:50.284 --> 05:51.476
(whoops)

05:51.518 --> 05:52.611
Zentipede!

05:52.653 --> 05:55.147
(rock music playing loudly)

05:55.189 --> 05:56.782
Ow! That's loud!

05:56.824 --> 05:57.783
What'd you say?

05:57.825 --> 06:02.854
Uh, uh... Oh... boy.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.157
Oh, God. (Groaning)

06:05.199 --> 06:08.427
Here it comes, man.
Here it comes.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.930
Here what comes,
lollipop hippie?!

06:11.972 --> 06:13.932
(wild screaming,
rock music continues loudly)

06:13.974 --> 06:15.033
(screaming)

06:15.075 --> 06:17.002
Gene, are you okay?

06:17.044 --> 06:19.971
I want to go!
I want to go right now!

06:20.013 --> 06:23.175
A-Are you sure? Because the...
(screaming)

06:23.217 --> 06:24.810
Oh, you seem sure.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.378
Don't make me go back in there!
(hyperventilating)

06:26.420 --> 06:27.713
Gene, it's okay. It's okay.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.381
Take a breath.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.782
Not that fast. (Groans loudly)

06:30.824 --> 06:32.384
Look, look, look, Gene, Gene.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.387
Do you want to go back in
or do you want to go home?

06:35.429 --> 06:37.189
Home! I mean, maybe.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.824
Uh, it's your birthday, so...

06:38.866 --> 06:40.492
Don't-don't worry about that.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.061
I-I won't enjoy the show
if you're not enjoying it.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.296
Okay, let's go home.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.164
Or we could go back in

06:46.206 --> 06:47.966
and I could help you
get through it,

06:48.008 --> 06:49.568
'cause it's just the beginning, and...
(screams)

06:49.610 --> 06:51.336
All right, all right.
Right, right. W-We'll go.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.911
We'll go. We'll go home.
Good plan.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.477
I know it's your birthday,
but you didn't tell me

06:58.519 --> 07:01.313
that was going to be the
loudest, scariest thing ever.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.148
I'm sorry, Gene.
Now that I think of it,

07:03.190 --> 07:05.150
I was, like, 16 when I went.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.985
11 is probably pretty young.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.421
This is like when you let me
watch <i> Beaches</i> all over again.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.422
Right.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.723
And <i> Terms of Endearment,</i>

07:11.765 --> 07:13.258
and then <i> Kramer vs. Kramer.</i>

07:13.300 --> 07:14.393
What the hell?!

07:14.435 --> 07:15.827
I was on a kick. Ah!

07:15.869 --> 07:17.362
L-Let's just go home.

07:17.404 --> 07:20.265
I mean, the music was
pretty great, right?

07:20.307 --> 07:22.567
How could you tell?
It was so loud.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.736
Well, if you want,
I could play you a song or two

07:24.778 --> 07:26.938
at normal volume, and we could
listen while we drive.

07:26.980 --> 07:27.939
Okay.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.074
(rock music playing over stereo)

07:29.116 --> 07:31.176
ROBOT:
<i>Attention, humans of America.</i>

07:31.218 --> 07:35.013
<i>I am General Inzanity,
and I have seized control.</i>

07:35.055 --> 07:36.248
<i>Control. Control!</i>

07:36.290 --> 07:37.616
Who's General Inzanity?

07:37.658 --> 07:39.684
Oh, he's an evil
robot army general

07:39.726 --> 07:42.521
who takes control of the
government in the year 2007,

07:42.563 --> 07:45.223
which used to be a long
time in the future.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.359
An evil robot army general,
you say?

07:47.401 --> 07:49.761
Yeah. The songs tell a story.
It's a rock opera.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.030
Well, they called it
a "rock-sperience,"

07:52.072 --> 07:54.032
which is dumber. Beg to differ.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.535
So, General Inzanity
starts cracking down on rockers

07:56.577 --> 07:58.537
who are just trying
to have a good time.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.771
But there's one rocker

07:59.813 --> 08:01.206
who fights back. He's a rebel.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.607
His name is "The Rebel."

08:02.649 --> 08:04.709
As a teenager, I kind
of related to him.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.378
Of course. Yeah.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.313
Anyway, The Rebel writes a
song that inspires people

08:08.355 --> 08:09.915
to rise up against
General Inzanity.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.650
It's called "Let My
People Rock. Part One."

08:11.692 --> 08:13.752
L-Let me skip to that one.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.922
♪<i> We don't need no bots</i> ♪

08:16.964 --> 08:20.225
♪<i> Let my people rock</i> ♪

08:20.267 --> 08:23.094
♪<i> We are not machines</i> ♪
(Bob mouthing along)

08:23.136 --> 08:26.498
♪<i> We like to wear</i>
<i>tight jeans...</i> ♪

08:26.540 --> 08:27.766
Catchy.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.134
So, then what happens?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.902
BOB: Well, hold on.
Let's do this right.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.437
Nice.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.239
All right, imagine this is
really cool lasers.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.407
Okay.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.442
So, General Inzanity
arrests the hero

08:37.484 --> 08:40.178
and sentences him to hard labor
in a rock quarry.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.813
Could happen. BOB: <i> And all day,</i>

08:41.855 --> 08:44.316
<i>the hero pushes these boulders
up a mountain</i>

08:44.358 --> 08:45.750
<i>to build General Inzanity
a new evil lair.</i>

08:45.792 --> 08:46.985
GENE: <i>Mm.</i>

08:47.027 --> 08:48.687
BOB: <i>And then
these rebel fighters show up,</i>

08:48.729 --> 08:50.188
<i>and they try
to help the hero escape,</i>

08:50.230 --> 08:51.656
<i>but instead, they get trapped</i>

08:51.698 --> 08:54.359
<i>on top of the mountain,
surrounded by the robot army.</i>

08:54.401 --> 08:56.294
<i>And that's when The Rebel
gets the idea</i>

08:56.336 --> 08:58.864
<i>to roll the boulders down
on the robots.</i>

08:58.906 --> 09:00.765
You mean he rolls rocks...

09:00.807 --> 09:02.434
To save rock and roll.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.870
Oh, my God.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.671
(chuckles) The plot
is not subtle.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.973
I like it.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.875
Oh, I haven't even told you
about the best part:

09:09.917 --> 09:11.710
The climax of the whole thing.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.712
It's, actually,
it's-it's hard to describe.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.614
I mean, I don't want
to oversell it,

09:15.656 --> 09:18.283
but it changes you forever.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.151
I want to see it.
Did we miss it?

09:20.193 --> 09:21.386
Did we miss the climax?

09:21.428 --> 09:23.054
Really? You want to go back?

09:23.096 --> 09:24.222
Yes? Kind of?

09:24.264 --> 09:26.124
I mean, maybe it's worth
going deaf

09:26.166 --> 09:27.659
and peeing in my pants a little.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.327
Also, it's your birthday.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.196
Wait, Gene, don't
go back for me.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.797
I'm not doing this for you.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.066
I'm doing this for me. And you.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.168
Now come on.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.336
Hello, ladies.

09:38.378 --> 09:39.971
My name's Andrew.
I'll be your server.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.173
Let's get you started with
those cinnamon buns you ordered.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.175
Cinnamon buns? We
didn't order these.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.044
You didn't order them, huh?
Uh-oh.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.712
It must've been
one of the dolls.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.481
Oh. My guess is Becky,

09:49.523 --> 09:51.182
because her favorite food
is cinnamon buns.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.717
Says so on her info card.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.419
Well, that's Becky for you.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.354
(laughs) You bring
the cinnamon buns

09:56.396 --> 09:58.256
and say a doll ordered
'em. I love it.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.425
(mouth full): This better not
show up on the check.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.427
I know the tricks.
They're complimentary.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.029
Well, they should be free.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.530
Um, waiter? Yes.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.599
If my doll orders anything,
could you warn me?

10:07.641 --> 10:09.901
Sure thing.
And is she looking at me?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.670
Now? No. Oh, good, good, good.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.338
But now she is. (Screams)

10:13.380 --> 10:14.906
Okay, I'll give you ladies
and your dolls

10:14.948 --> 10:16.508
a moment to look at the menu.

10:16.550 --> 10:19.177
FYI, the dinner dolls must stay
in the restaurant area.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.279
They're not store dolls,
they're dinner dolls.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.415
They've accepted it.
So should you.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.250
So, let's see.
Let's read about Becky.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.685
Let's get to know her.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.787
It says here Becky
is the daughter

10:28.829 --> 10:31.089
of a rich merchant in the 1890s.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.757
Whenever that was.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.594
Okay, I'll play.
My doll's name is Suzie.

10:35.636 --> 10:39.864
She was the first girl
to wear glasses in public.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.700
Which is pretty cool.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.603
My doll keeps pulling her dress
over her head. Stop it!

10:44.645 --> 10:46.037
How about yours, Tina?

10:46.079 --> 10:47.439
Yeah, tell us about
Little Winky.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.607
What's her deal?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.308
Ugh. Her name is Francine.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.776
She's a ballerina.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.311
(chuckles): Ballerina? Whoa.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.547
How do they come up
with this stuff?

10:55.589 --> 10:57.582
"Francine joined
an American ballet troupe

10:57.624 --> 10:59.784
"that toured the world at
the beginning of the Cold War.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.219
"While in Europe,
she was recruited

11:01.261 --> 11:02.587
to spy on the Russians."

11:02.629 --> 11:03.588
Ooh!

11:03.630 --> 11:05.423
What a weird,
serious little doll.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.791
She's a spy?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.493
Okay, her I like.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.663
Really? Then maybe she could sit
with you and Suzie. (Chuckles)

11:11.705 --> 11:13.098
(whispers): Help me.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.633
Uh, okay. Sure. Thanks. Thanks.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.635
Gretchen, your doll's
on the floor, hon.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.570
Oh, look at you.
You're all dirty!

11:18.612 --> 11:20.005
What are you doing down there?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.606
No ins and outs!

11:21.648 --> 11:23.274
Can we buy new tickets?

11:23.316 --> 11:24.175
Sold out!

11:24.217 --> 11:25.944
We could be seat fillers

11:25.986 --> 11:28.446
when the celebrities in
the audience go to the bathroom.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.248
No. Aah! You're impossible!

11:30.290 --> 11:32.784
Gene, look. It's the scalper.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.185
Uh, pardon me. Hey.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.487
Wait. What are you mad about?

11:35.529 --> 11:36.821
Tickets, socks or marijuana?

11:36.863 --> 11:38.490
No. No. What? I-I wanted to see

11:38.532 --> 11:40.425
if you have any more
tickets for sale.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.127
Is obstructed view okay?

11:42.169 --> 11:43.595
Sure. Then you can try
watching from here.

11:43.637 --> 11:44.996
(wheezing laugh) Sorry.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.132
Huh. That's a scalper joke.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.668
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, man.
I'm out of tickets.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.836
Crap! All right, well,
we gave it a shot, Gene.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.638
I-I guess it wasn't
meant to happen.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.441
I mean, uh, there is
a way to sneak in,

11:56.483 --> 12:00.111
but it's not for beginners
who don't buy slap bracelets.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.646
Please! It's his birthday!

12:01.688 --> 12:03.882
He's not gonna have that many more.
Gene.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.316
(sighs) All right.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.118
It's risky,
but if you give me $20,

12:07.160 --> 12:08.653
we'll get you
into the laser show.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.455
Okay, but how?
We-we want to get in

12:10.497 --> 12:12.323
before the big finish,
and that's any minute.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.627
All will be revealed
when you give me... $25.

12:15.669 --> 12:16.861
Wait. You just said $20.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.196
Throw in
your slappiest slap bracelet,

12:18.238 --> 12:19.771
and you've got a deal!

12:23.509 --> 12:26.037
Okay, here's 25 bucks.
So, uh, what do we do?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.839
Well, first, allow me. Bam!

12:27.881 --> 12:29.240
Ow. Slappy birthday, Dad.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.975
On this paper,
you'll find a phone number.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.244
It's the direct line
to the concession stand inside.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.679
Call it,

12:34.721 --> 12:36.748
and when the guy picks up,
give him the pass phrase.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.149
What's the pass phrase?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.651
The pass phrase is...

12:39.693 --> 12:41.653
(whispering, rattled coughing)

12:41.695 --> 12:43.254
Oh, God.

12:43.296 --> 12:46.224
Word to the wise: Two guys work
at the concession stand.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.860
One is cool, the other is not.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.229
Okay. Um, what are their names?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.330
They're both named Nick.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.665
Oh. Nice.

12:53.707 --> 12:56.234
If the uncool Nick answers,
hang up right away.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.837
How are we supposed to know
which Nick we're talking to?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.238
You'll know the cool Nick,

13:00.280 --> 13:01.673
'cause, you know,
he sounds cool.

13:01.715 --> 13:03.074
Okay.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.609
Another word to the wise. Mm.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.611
The uncool Nick knows
we do this,

13:06.653 --> 13:08.413
so sometimes
he tries to sound cool,

13:08.455 --> 13:10.014
and he's very good.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.750
It's almost impossible
to tell the difference.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.051
Oh, my God.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.619
I guess we'll feel it out.
Thank you.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.921
If you get caught,
you do not know me. I'm out!

13:16.963 --> 13:19.624
Look at him go!
His ponytail's like a propeller!

13:19.666 --> 13:21.126
He's gonna take off!

13:21.168 --> 13:23.361
Miss, we have
your chicken fingers,

13:23.403 --> 13:24.929
and for your dolls, our best

13:24.971 --> 13:26.264
plastic spaghetti.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.732
That's why I love this gal.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.134
She's watching the Russians,

13:29.176 --> 13:30.602
but she's not
watching her carbs.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.303
Well, Francine's
getting discontinued,

13:32.345 --> 13:34.472
so now's the time to live it up.

13:34.514 --> 13:37.375
Wait, what? What did he
mean, uh, "discontinued"?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.377
Mm, sometimes they stop
making a certain doll,

13:39.419 --> 13:41.246
so they get rid of
the whole stock.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.114
Usually, they donate 'em
to poor kids.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.383
Huh, that's nice.
But that's just the new dolls.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.818
For these dinner dolls,
it's different.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.788
They get dinged up,
so discontinued dinner dolls

13:49.830 --> 13:51.256
get put in a sort of...

13:51.298 --> 13:53.091
It's a sort of like a... W-What?

13:53.133 --> 13:56.227
I guess you'd call it like a...
a chipper-shredder for dolls.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.762
(gasps) What?!

13:57.804 --> 13:59.497
Yeah, it turns 'em
into this shredded stuff.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.133
They use it in the mat material
over in the play area.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.803
Sometimes an eye
doesn't get shredded,

14:04.845 --> 14:07.906
and it looks like a kid
is down there staring at you!

14:07.948 --> 14:09.274
(laughing)

14:09.316 --> 14:11.743
(Gretchen clears throat)

14:11.785 --> 14:15.079
It's pretty messed up
when you think about it.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.915
Just sipping my wine.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.950
(line ringing)
GENE: You got this, Dad.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.985
Remember, hang up if the
uncool Nick answers.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.453
MAN: <i>Hello?</i>

14:22.495 --> 14:24.956
Uh, h-hello.
Is this the concession stand?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.124
Yeah.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.625
Uh, can you, um...

14:27.667 --> 14:30.428
tell me about, uh, some
of the concessions you have?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.096
We have sweet snacks. Mm.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.498
Salty snacks. Nice.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.333
Some snacks that kind of
straddle the line.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.768
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.169
(quietly): Cool Nick
or Uncool Nick?

14:38.211 --> 14:40.104
(whispers): I can't tell.
Let me.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.440
Congratulations. You've
been selected for a survey.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.310
Do you ever say things like,
"Boy, I sure am cool

14:45.352 --> 14:47.545
compared to my coworker Nick"?
I'm Nick.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.614
No, I know, but which one?!

14:49.656 --> 14:51.282
Gene, give me the phone. Ah!

14:51.324 --> 14:53.618
Hi. Uh, it's me again.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.320
Uh, what would you do
if I told you,

14:55.362 --> 14:57.689
"The moons of Uranus
are on fire"?

14:57.731 --> 15:00.325
<i>Oh,</i> did the scalper guy say

15:00.367 --> 15:02.160
there's a cool Nick
and a not-cool Nick,

15:02.202 --> 15:03.995
and you have to know
the pass phrase or something?

15:04.037 --> 15:06.030
Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I forgot.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.199
Sometimes I pretend to be
two different guys named Nick

15:08.241 --> 15:10.134
just to mess with him.
It's really boring here.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.537
Anyway, you want to get in?
Yes, please.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.706
All right, meet me
around back in three minutes.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.207
Bring 20 bucks.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.508
I already paid the scalper.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.377
Well, I'm not the scalper, am I?

15:19.419 --> 15:20.879
I'm two guys named Nick.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.847
Fine.
Around back. Three minutes.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.415
If you're not there,
I'm not waiting.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.818
All right, first of all,
there's only one Nick.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.319
What?!

15:28.361 --> 15:29.921
I know. I can't
explain right now.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.257
We have to meet him around back
in three minutes.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.892
Around back in three minutes?

15:33.934 --> 15:36.194
Oh. Yeah. That's far.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.830
Dad, I... think we're
gonna have to run.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.231
No, Gene.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.333
I just don't see any other way.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.768
But I can't.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.236
I think we're gonna have to.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.704
(sighs) Okay.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.873
So, walk first
and build up speed,

15:48.915 --> 15:50.408
or just start running?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.210
J-Just start,
I think! Just start!

15:52.252 --> 15:53.611
Oh, God.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.847
Watch! This is what
I think it is!

15:55.889 --> 15:58.182
(Gene murmuring gibberish)

15:58.224 --> 16:00.351
LOUISE: I mean, I know
she's just a frickin' doll,

16:00.393 --> 16:01.920
but she's the only
cool one they have.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.888
And they want to toss her
into a doll shredder?

16:03.930 --> 16:04.856
Sorry, Louise.

16:04.898 --> 16:06.691
Yeah, I shouldn't
have said anything.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.460
Well, maybe we can buy Francine
and give her a new home with us.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.462
No! I mean, okay,
I'm fine with it.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.797
Oh, I don't think
they'll sell...

16:12.839 --> 16:13.865
Uh, excuse me, waiter?

16:13.907 --> 16:15.466
Everyone good? How are
the cinnamon buns sitting

16:15.508 --> 16:16.901
with those chicken fingers?

16:16.943 --> 16:19.037
Not great.
Listen, how much would it cost

16:19.079 --> 16:21.706
to buy one of the dolls?
Say, this doll right here?

16:21.748 --> 16:24.142
Oh, one of the dinner dolls?
Yeah.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.710
Those aren't for sale. Why not?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.078
Well, the Special Girl
Corporation

16:27.120 --> 16:29.480
wouldn't sell
a dirty old dinner doll.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.815
What?! Ouch. Oh, excuse me.

16:30.857 --> 16:31.950
There's a doll over there

16:31.992 --> 16:33.217
who's trying
to get my attention.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.218
Ugh!

16:34.260 --> 16:35.453
New plan, everybody.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.488
We grab Francine and
make a break for it.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.590
They can't take us
down, not all of us.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.426
Nuh-uh. No.
I can't lose this job.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.794
I still have payments

16:42.836 --> 16:44.929
on that Jet Ski
I crashed seven years ago.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.731
But maybe
I can still help you out.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.100
That doll... she's a spy, right?
Yeah.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.602
Then she must be pretty good
with disguises, huh?

16:51.644 --> 16:52.971
Huh.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.973
(panting) Oh, God.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.141
Everything hurts.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.410
Just imagine yourself
inside the planetarium,

16:59.452 --> 17:01.079
having an amazing climax.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.614
Gene, that's... Never mind.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.583
That must be the door.
Did we make it?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.518
Maybe we're early.
Are we in shape now?

17:07.560 --> 17:08.920
Should we wear tank tops?

17:08.962 --> 17:10.021
Maybe.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.923
What is that? It's Pluto,

17:11.964 --> 17:13.590
the disgraced ex-planet.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.259
Oh. I guess they're
throwing it away.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.127
In my class,
we pulled all the Plutos

17:17.170 --> 17:18.529
off our solar system models,

17:18.570 --> 17:20.698
and then stomped them
into the ground.

17:20.740 --> 17:21.699
It's him!

17:21.741 --> 17:23.608
Come on, let's go!
No, Dad! Wait!

17:25.911 --> 17:27.939
Oh, my God,
we've got to get to that door.

17:27.981 --> 17:29.207
Planetariums are so stressful.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.382
Why didn't you warn us,
Neil deGrasse Tyson?!

17:35.988 --> 17:37.882
Hello? Anybody there?

17:37.924 --> 17:39.450
Nick's not gonna wait.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.220
But if we go, the security guard
will see us. We won't get in.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.855
Closing the door.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.391
Closing it slowly.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.961
No. Let my people
rock. Part one.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.863
(grunting) What are you doing?

17:51.905 --> 17:53.104
Dad, help.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.134
What the hell?

17:56.176 --> 17:57.969
It's heading for
the employee parking lot.

17:58.011 --> 18:00.471
This is why
everyone hates you, Pluto!

18:00.513 --> 18:02.874
Go, go, go, go, go!
Hold the door!

18:02.916 --> 18:04.909
We're here! Oh. Hey.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.377
Gene, that was amazing!

18:06.419 --> 18:08.679
You rolled a rock
to save rock and roll.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.848
And now, to celebrate,
you can give me $20.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.483
Oh, right. Here.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.585
We got to hurry, Gene.
Let's get to our seats.

18:14.627 --> 18:15.920
Thanks, Nick. Cool Nick.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.555
I'm gonna miss you guys.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.524
It sounds like they're at the
part right before the climax.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.525
Uh-huh.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.526
You okay?

18:21.568 --> 18:23.728
Uh-huh. I think so?

18:23.770 --> 18:27.432
Gene, you can do this,
and it'll be worth it, I hope.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.700
Zentipede? Zentipede!

18:29.742 --> 18:30.935
Wait. (Rock music playing)

18:30.977 --> 18:32.270
Uh, can I borrow
a napkin? Thanks.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.038
I can make you
ear plugs with this.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.207
(groaning)

18:36.249 --> 18:38.209
Gross. And thank you.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.445
(rock music continues)

18:40.487 --> 18:42.947
What we got to do is make
this doll look like a doll

18:42.989 --> 18:44.415
that <i> isn't</i> getting discontinued,

18:44.457 --> 18:46.684
so we got to sneak her
to my salon station.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.086
But the waiter said

18:48.128 --> 18:49.620
dinner dolls weren't allowed
outside the restaurant.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.289
Yeah, and he's been hovering.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.723
Don't worry. I'll deal with him.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.025
Oh, waiter?

18:54.067 --> 18:56.461
Well, what can I do for you
at this late stage in your meal

18:56.503 --> 18:59.030
when most people are done
asking things from the waiter?

18:59.072 --> 19:01.966
Can you pretty please
box this up for us?

19:02.008 --> 19:04.135
That's the doll's food.
That stays in the restaurant.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.070
But could you
pretend to box it up

19:06.112 --> 19:08.773
and bring it out and say,
"Here's your boxes"?

19:08.815 --> 19:11.709
Uh, yes, ma'am, I can do that.

19:11.751 --> 19:12.710
All right.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.352
Go! Go!

19:15.787 --> 19:17.815
Get a Sabrina doll from
the shelves up front.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.585
Okay. Then go to accessories
and get a Sabrina dress,

19:20.627 --> 19:22.487
a Sabrina headband
and Sabrina shoes.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.622
Got it. Meet me at
my station ASAP.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.890
And don't act suspicious.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.225
Pretend you're a little girl.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.726
Pshh. I'll try.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.769
(rock music playing loudly)

19:50.556 --> 19:52.590
♪ ♪

20:04.870 --> 20:06.831
BOB: Yeah! This is amazing!

20:06.873 --> 20:09.534
Zentipede!

20:09.576 --> 20:11.035
LOUISE:
Hard to believe that's her.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.170
You're good, lady.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.105
Thanks. Let me do
your mop sometime.

20:14.147 --> 20:16.140
Hey, easy. Easy. Wait.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.009
What if they discontinue
Sabrina?

20:18.051 --> 20:20.478
The one we stuck with the dinner
dolls will get shredded.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.380
Oh, they're never gonna
discontinue Sabrina.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.382
Sabrina pays the bills
in this place.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.950
So what do you think?

20:25.992 --> 20:28.119
Should we put Little Miss Winky
back on the shelf?

20:28.161 --> 20:30.288
Or we could buy her.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.190
Bring this little spy
in from the cold?

20:32.232 --> 20:34.225
With Gretchen's discount,
it shouldn't be too bad.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.227
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

20:36.269 --> 20:38.329
Uh, I don't think so.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.897
Look at Tina.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.566
I mean, she has enough problems.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.834
Let's just leave Francine here
and know that

20:43.876 --> 20:46.137
we helped a girl
out of a tough spot.

20:46.179 --> 20:48.973
Hey, you know what?
I'll be fine.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.342
I'm, like, so comfortable
with this doll.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.010
My phobia is gone. Really?

20:53.052 --> 20:54.412
Yeah. See how normal I'm acting?

20:54.454 --> 20:55.846
All right!

20:55.888 --> 20:57.582
Thanks, T. No sweat.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.150
(rock music playing)
So, the laser show...

20:59.192 --> 21:00.484
It holds up, right?

21:00.526 --> 21:02.019
I mean, you've never
seen it before,

21:02.061 --> 21:04.055
but could you sense
it holding up?

21:04.097 --> 21:05.723
I loved it. What?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.392
Sorry. Talk louder.
My hearing's kind of shot.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.161
(shouting):
I said I loved it, Dad!

21:10.203 --> 21:11.862
(loudly): I love you, too, Gene.
