00:05.297 --> 00:06.673
Hey.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.132
- Hey.
- Wow.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.218
Hot dog times, huh?

00:09.384 --> 00:10.677
I only eat them on special occasions.

00:10.844 --> 00:11.803
What's the special occasion?

00:11.970 --> 00:13.388
I decided to eat one.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.640
Fair enough.

00:14.806 --> 00:15.849
You going this way?

00:16.015 --> 00:18.640
Uh, no, I'm going in here, actually.

00:18.814 --> 00:22.851
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, bye.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.198
Church on a Tuesday?

00:27.361 --> 00:28.909
But he seemed so normal.

00:29.079 --> 00:31.900
I know, right?

00:32.197 --> 00:33.152
And, uh, this is Kenneth,

00:33.326 --> 00:34.991
one of our pages. Kenneth, this is Devin Banks,

00:35.168 --> 00:36.662
our Vice President of West Coast News,

00:36.825 --> 00:38.703
Web Content and Theme Park Talent Relations.

00:38.877 --> 00:41.542
Hey, Devin, you better watch out,
Kenneth might take your job one day.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.331
Or your job, Jack.

00:44.507 --> 00:47.170
Or his job!

00:47.758 --> 00:51.132
Why don't we just, uh--

00:54.347 --> 00:55.553
- Devin.
- Yeah.

00:55.728 --> 00:56.800
Morning.
My notes.

00:56.975 --> 00:59.601
Ugh, dude, how can we be
wearing the same outfit?

00:59.768 --> 01:01.271
You saw me leave
the apartment this morning.

01:01.437 --> 01:03.100
I saw you put it on and
I thought it looked nice.

01:03.276 --> 01:04.391
How long are you staying with me?

01:04.566 --> 01:05.522
Indefinitely.

01:05.696 --> 01:06.192
Huh.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.651
Liz, I want you to meet Devin Banks.

01:07.816 --> 01:08.811
He's in from L.A.

01:08.987 --> 01:10.021
Devin, this is Lemon.

01:10.198 --> 01:10.651
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10.826 --> 01:11.782
- Love the show.
- Thank you.

01:11.948 --> 01:14.073
Look, I gotta go.
Thanks for the tour.

01:14.247 --> 01:18.322
You guys... you're the real heroes.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.492
They get younger every year.

01:21.668 --> 01:24.041
These punks who think
they can take down Jack Donaghy.

01:24.207 --> 01:25.502
You're worried about that guy?

01:25.668 --> 01:29.132
Banks is in New York for a reason,
and I intend to send him back to L.A.

01:29.295 --> 01:32.302
Wow, if this turns into a showdown,
you guys could settle it with a

01:32.468 --> 01:34.973
talking like this contest.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.633
Banks is no slouch.

01:36.807 --> 01:39.800
He pioneered the concept
of ten second internet sitcoms.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.013
* Making it happen

01:42.188 --> 01:43.472
Honey, I'm home.

01:43.647 --> 01:45.141
Oh, great.

01:45.315 --> 01:47.851
* We made it

01:48.027 --> 01:50.651
I'm sure he's here to dazzle the old men
with his webisode ideas,

01:50.818 --> 01:51.902
but I have ideas too, Lemon.

01:52.077 --> 01:52.613
Like what?

01:52.777 --> 01:53.731
Something big.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.453
A live television special with fireworks.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.950
They can do shapes now.

01:58.116 --> 01:59.990
One time, I saw a cowboy hat.

02:00.165 --> 02:02.243
Boom, boom, boom.

02:02.417 --> 02:04.661
Boy, you're gonna need more than that though.

02:04.838 --> 02:05.700
Maybe you're right.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.251
I want you on this, Lemon.

02:07.416 --> 02:10.001
Those jokes you wrote for my Mitt Romney
fundraiser, they were top-notch.

02:10.178 --> 02:10.960
Those weren't jokes.

02:11.135 --> 02:14.590
That was an appeal for
a return to common sense and decency.

02:14.765 --> 02:18.133
Well, it got big laughs.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.263
Yeah, we should do a sketch
about alien abductions.

02:20.438 --> 02:21.143
Yeah.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.472
Like a Lamaze class in Roswell.

02:23.648 --> 02:24.641
Lamazewell.

02:24.816 --> 02:27.981
Dude, what's with
the ridiculous hat and glasses?

02:28.147 --> 02:29.063
I'm incognito.

02:29.237 --> 02:32.063
Some dude is trying to slap me
with a subpoena for a paternity suit.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.980
But the kid ain't mine.

02:34.156 --> 02:35.230
How do you know it's not your child?

02:35.407 --> 02:37.532
'Cause I remember
that girl and it's impossible.

02:37.696 --> 02:39.242
I never got out of my car

02:39.406 --> 02:42.410
and she never got
all the way out of her tollbooth!

02:42.576 --> 02:43.200
Okay.

02:43.377 --> 02:44.583
Let's get back to work, guys.

02:44.746 --> 02:47.662
How about a sketch
about Bill Clinton eating hamburgers?

02:47.838 --> 02:50.460
That stinks.
What is this, 1992?

02:50.625 --> 02:52.130
Eh, what do you want from me?

02:52.295 --> 02:53.383
I'm not a comedy writer.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.043
Wha--?

02:54.215 --> 02:55.842
Mr. Jordan...

02:56.007 --> 02:59.133
you've been served.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.536 --> 03:21.361
You know, the more I think about it,

03:21.535 --> 03:24.121
the more jazzed I'm getting
about these fireworks.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.291
Maybe don't pitch
the fireworks thing right away.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.662
I'm gonna come up with a couple other things
I think you'll like better.

03:28.837 --> 03:29.713
Well, what I'm saying is,

03:29.878 --> 03:32.332
that is what we're selling
at the pitch meeting, Lemon:

03:32.507 --> 03:33.383
spectacle.

03:33.548 --> 03:35.633
It's what people want.
The Romans knew it.

03:35.795 --> 03:37.753
Louis XIV knew it.
Wolfowitz knows it.

03:37.928 --> 03:39.131
Mr. Donaghy.

03:39.308 --> 03:41.433
As instructed,
I was spying on Mr. Banks.

03:41.597 --> 03:43.681
And there's something
you should know.

03:43.846 --> 03:44.893
So...

03:45.056 --> 03:46.513
what team do you play for?

03:46.686 --> 03:48.063
Oh, it's not really a team.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.640
It's just a bunch of guys
who like doing gymnastics.

03:50.818 --> 03:51.563
You know...

03:51.735 --> 03:52.812
I'm gonna be in town
for a little while.

03:52.987 --> 03:55.363
Maybe we could... get together.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.113
My, you're friendly!

03:57.278 --> 03:58.401
Good God.

03:58.578 --> 04:00.071
Devin is gay.

04:00.245 --> 04:01.990
He's even more powerful
than I thought.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.070
Maybe you should seduce him

04:03.248 --> 04:07.453
and get him to tell you
all his secret plans.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.241
So Mr. Donaghy,
what can I do for you?

04:09.418 --> 04:12.661
I heard you were talking
with my colleague Devin Banks.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.290
Did he tell you
why he was in New York?

04:14.466 --> 04:16.922
No, sir, we just talked
about Anderson Cooper mostly.

04:17.095 --> 04:18.052
You should get to know Devin.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.382
Tell him all of your television ideas.

04:19.555 --> 04:21.672
You know, he started off
as a page just like you.

04:21.846 --> 04:24.682
Really? So did I!

04:24.847 --> 04:26.973
You say the right things,
ask him the right questions,

04:27.147 --> 04:28.432
I'm sure he could open
some doors for you.

04:28.605 --> 04:30.181
Okay. What kinds of questions?

04:30.355 --> 04:31.641
I'll write them down for you.

04:31.817 --> 04:32.602
You call him,

04:32.775 --> 04:36.021
tell him you got two tickets
for A Chorus Line for tonight.

04:36.195 --> 04:37.731
And, uh...Kenneth...

04:37.906 --> 04:41.533
Have you ever used bronzer?

04:42.828 --> 04:45.111
Dr. Spaceman, when they check my DNA,

04:45.286 --> 04:46.870
will they tell me
what diseases I might get

04:47.035 --> 04:49.450
or help me to remember
my ATM pin code?

04:49.628 --> 04:50.703
Absolutely.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.660
Science is whatever
we want it to be.

04:53.837 --> 04:55.331
I'll let you know
as soon as I have the results.

04:55.505 --> 04:57.840
I already know the results.
The kid is not mine.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.800
Boy, it's crazy to think we used to
settle questions of paternity

05:00.966 --> 05:05.051
by dunking a woman in water
until she admitted she made it all up.

05:05.225 --> 05:09.012
Mm...different time, the '60s.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.390
But he was going to church
in the middle of the day on a Tuesday.

05:15.567 --> 05:17.691
What do you think that means?

05:17.866 --> 05:21.072
It means he probably murdered someone
and found God while he was in jail.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.192
Maybe he's born-again? Ugh, boy.

05:23.367 --> 05:27.702
We'll spend our Saturdays in Central Park
trying to "save" gay rollerbladers.

05:27.875 --> 05:30.203
I just wish people would tell you
immediately when you meet them,

05:30.378 --> 05:33.450
"Hi, I am so and so.
Here's all the weird stuff about me."

05:33.704 --> 05:34.501
Ah, that would never work.

05:34.663 --> 05:37.258
If I told my wife in college,
"Hey, I'm gonna lose all this beautiful hair

05:37.421 --> 05:39.509
and fart in my sleep
for the next 20 years,"

05:39.679 --> 05:42.092
she never would have married me.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.631
Love is like an onion,

05:43.806 --> 05:46.383
and you peel away layer
after stinky layer

05:46.557 --> 05:51.143
until you're just...
weeping over the sink.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.183
Is that my sweatshirt?

05:54.356 --> 05:56.143
Hey!

05:56.315 --> 05:57.980
Oh...sorry.

05:58.156 --> 06:00.941
No, no-- Ugh!

06:01.576 --> 06:04.192
And I have an idea for a show
about a teacher named Art.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.113
I call that one "Art School."

06:06.286 --> 06:09.160
And one about a Jewish guy
who opens an ice cream parlor.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.493
That one's called "Ice Cream Cohen."

06:11.666 --> 06:16.160
And a drama about two cops,
one named Cash and one named Carry.

06:16.336 --> 06:17.923
I don't have a title for that one.

06:18.088 --> 06:19.421
- But then also--
- Kenneth.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.210
Can I offer you a libation?

06:21.387 --> 06:25.593
- I have champagne, vodka, absinthe--
- Fruit punch, please.

06:25.765 --> 06:28.133
Right.

06:28.805 --> 06:29.380
You'll excuse me.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.851
I'll go slip into something
a little more comfortable.

06:33.016 --> 06:36.143
Like in the movies!

06:39.105 --> 06:41.983
So Mr. Banks...

06:42.158 --> 06:43.903
what brings you to New York?

06:44.076 --> 06:46.242
Oh, just making the rounds.

06:46.408 --> 06:47.240
Hmm.

06:47.405 --> 06:52.661
What projects are you working on
near-slash-long term?

06:53.707 --> 06:55.991
Oh my. That's an awful short robe.

06:56.168 --> 06:57.040
I know.

06:57.205 --> 07:00.872
I had to cut it down myself.

07:01.837 --> 07:04.553
Oh, Kenneth.

07:04.886 --> 07:07.841
You know, I was a page.

07:08.017 --> 07:12.051
And when I was in the program,
we'd give each other a hand.

07:12.228 --> 07:16.140
Can you give me a hand, Kenneth?

07:16.898 --> 07:18.603
For a fellow page, anything!

07:18.778 --> 07:20.390
Great.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.191
Tell me about Jack Donaghy.

07:26.405 --> 07:29.153
Tracy, I have the results
of your DNA test.

07:29.326 --> 07:33.573
Now, I'm very serious about
doctor/patient confidentiality...

07:33.748 --> 07:39.373
so I'm gonna have to ask
at all four of us keep this to ourselves.

07:39.547 --> 07:40.580
What's the verdict, Doc?

07:40.757 --> 07:41.373
Good news.

07:41.546 --> 07:43.172
You are not the father of that child.

07:43.336 --> 07:46.380
- Yeah!
- However, according to my DNA database,

07:46.555 --> 07:49.303
you are a direct descendant
of our third president.

07:49.468 --> 07:51.133
Jasper Buceman?

07:51.306 --> 07:52.183
No, Tracy.

07:52.345 --> 07:54.510
Our third president.
Thomas Jefferson.

07:54.687 --> 07:56.430
Jefferson? Not possible.

07:56.606 --> 07:57.681
Yeah, that's a white dude.

07:57.855 --> 08:00.393
Yeah, but that guy was into black chicks.

08:00.568 --> 08:02.813
I'm surprised I am not a descendant.

08:02.986 --> 08:06.900
These DNA results show
that genetically you're mostly white.

08:07.077 --> 08:08.110
That ridiculous.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.281
I can't be white.

08:09.446 --> 08:11.610
My whole persona is based
on an in-depth analysis

08:11.788 --> 08:14.281
of the differences between
black and white.

08:14.458 --> 08:17.203
This is how black people dial a phone.

08:17.378 --> 08:19.453
* Boop ood a-boop a-doop a-doop whoop *

08:19.625 --> 08:23.920
This is how white people dial a phone.

08:26.086 --> 08:29.340
I gotta call my wife.

08:41.736 --> 08:43.520
Devin.

08:43.698 --> 08:45.983
What can I do for you?

08:46.155 --> 08:48.271
I think we're way past that, Jack.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.860
Let's be honest with each other.

08:50.038 --> 08:52.820
I'll go first.

08:52.997 --> 08:55.161
I'm gay
and I want your job.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.493
Devin, I'm straighter than you are gay

08:56.665 --> 08:59.373
and I leave particles of guys
like you in my wind.

08:59.545 --> 09:00.581
I'm not afraid of you.

09:00.747 --> 09:03.370
Yeah, well, you should be.

09:03.546 --> 09:06.421
Lets just see how little
shakes out in the meeting.

09:06.585 --> 09:09.000
Yeah...

09:09.675 --> 09:12.052
let's.

09:15.887 --> 09:21.681
Oh, by the way, a little slim-waisted birdie
in a page jacket told me you got nothing.

09:21.855 --> 09:22.982
You're going down.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.481
No, Devin.

09:25.646 --> 09:28.613
I don't do that.

09:34.118 --> 09:34.743
No, no, no.

09:34.907 --> 09:35.741
Are you kidding me?

09:35.906 --> 09:37.361
You eat too many hot dogs.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.990
Please, I am concerned.

09:39.166 --> 09:41.582
I copied this article on sodium for you.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.120
Fine.

09:42.295 --> 09:47.671
But I will be reporting this
to the Fox Problem Solvers.

10:03.476 --> 10:04.023
Oh, boy.

10:04.186 --> 10:07.732
What is this, Bible study?

10:09.238 --> 10:11.572
Excuse me one second.

10:11.738 --> 10:13.280
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:13.448 --> 10:14.441
I didn't know you came here.

10:14.617 --> 10:16.902
Oh, well, I haven't been
in a super long time.

10:17.077 --> 10:19.622
But, yeah, my parents used to
make me go every week.

10:19.788 --> 10:21.073
Wow.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.451
Well, welcome back.

10:22.626 --> 10:23.083
Thanks.

10:23.246 --> 10:24.583
You're doing the right thing.

10:24.807 --> 10:28.081
Go ahead, have a seat.

10:29.375 --> 10:33.462
Okay, everybody.
Let's get started.

10:33.806 --> 10:36.800
Hi, my name is Floyd
and I'm an alcoholic.

10:36.975 --> 10:37.591
Hi, Floyd.

10:37.766 --> 10:38.973
Hi, Floyd. Uh...

10:39.138 --> 10:41.720
It's been four years since my last drink.

10:41.896 --> 10:44.971
But I just broke up with
my girlfriend, so I guess today

10:45.147 --> 10:49.772
I'll be talking about
my issues with women and trust.

10:49.945 --> 10:53.691
The dishonesty that my dad...

10:55.078 --> 10:56.153
You stayed?

10:56.325 --> 10:57.780
Pete, you don't understand.

10:57.956 --> 10:59.450
He was pouring his guts out.

10:59.618 --> 11:02.872
It was like eavesdropping
on somebody else's therapy.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.122
It was great.

11:04.287 --> 11:05.243
Yeah, that's not okay.

11:05.418 --> 11:08.040
But I just feel like
I've known him forever now, you know?

11:08.217 --> 11:09.792
I mean, his father was awful.

11:09.967 --> 11:10.922
Awful.

11:11.086 --> 11:13.290
And he told this story
about trying to make French toast

11:13.467 --> 11:16.672
for his mom when he was a kid
and he started crying!

11:16.845 --> 11:17.462
I love him.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.383
Liz, what is your plan here?
What are you gonna do?

11:19.558 --> 11:21.593
You're gonna fake being an alcoholic
for the rest of your life?

11:21.767 --> 11:23.101
I don't know, okay?

11:23.265 --> 11:24.683
One day at a time, Pete.

11:24.858 --> 11:27.932
I'm gonna take it one day at a time.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.980
I want you to tell me everything
that happened last night.

11:30.147 --> 11:34.020
The curtains open on a group
of chorus line dreamers in 1970s leotards--

11:34.197 --> 11:35.233
Five, x--

11:35.405 --> 11:37.072
Stop that. I'm not talking about the show.

11:37.235 --> 11:39.441
The only reason I sent you to Banks
was to get information.

11:39.617 --> 11:41.072
Why were you telling him anything?

11:41.247 --> 11:42.163
I'm sorry, sir.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.583
I had to keep talking just to stop him
from putting his fingers in my mouth.

11:45.748 --> 11:49.293
Kenneth, you are the worst gay bait ever.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.663
You used me?

11:50.836 --> 11:51.713
For television.

11:51.876 --> 11:54.713
Kenneth, I humiliated you for television.

11:54.885 --> 11:57.501
Like on What's Happening
when that man used Rerun

11:57.676 --> 11:59.460
to bootleg that Doobie Brothers concert!

11:59.635 --> 12:00.422
Exactly.

12:00.597 --> 12:01.882
And I need to humiliate you again.

12:02.057 --> 12:04.973
I got a very important meeting coming up
and Banks cannot be there.

12:05.148 --> 12:06.640
And you want me to kill him.

12:06.818 --> 12:08.022
No.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.473
I need you to distract him.

12:09.648 --> 12:12.522
You gotta make sure he doesn't leave
that hotel room tomorrow morning.

12:12.695 --> 12:13.651
I'll do it.

12:13.816 --> 12:18.111
Just like Sidney Bristow on Alias,
I'll use my sexuality as a weapon.

12:18.287 --> 12:21.242
To the wig shop!

12:21.537 --> 12:22.490
Psst, Lemon!

12:22.656 --> 12:23.701
Lemon, it's on.

12:23.867 --> 12:24.702
Banks is gunning for me.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.163
8:00 a.m., Thursday. Are you ready?

12:26.338 --> 12:29.540
Yeah, I've been working on it all week.

12:29.705 --> 12:33.171
I don't know what happened in your life
that cause you to develop a sense of humor

12:33.337 --> 12:34.120
as a coping mechanism.

12:34.297 --> 12:37.632
Maybe it was some sort of brace
or corrective boot you wore during childhood.

12:37.795 --> 12:40.761
But in any case,
I'm glad you're on my team.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.722
Ah.

12:42.885 --> 12:44.223
I can't do this sketch!

12:44.386 --> 12:45.303
What? Why?

12:45.475 --> 12:47.852
Because you can't have
a white dude playing a criminal.

12:48.015 --> 12:49.970
That's a negative portrayal of my people!

12:50.147 --> 12:51.390
Tracy, you're not white.

12:51.568 --> 12:53.480
I don't know who I am anymore!

12:53.648 --> 12:55.903
There's been a black man inside of me
for a long time,

12:56.068 --> 12:58.021
now there's a white guy up in here too.

12:58.195 --> 13:01.031
It's like the audience
for a Bobby McFerrin concert up in here!

13:01.195 --> 13:04.403
Tracy, you should be honored to be
a descendant of Thomas Jefferson.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.283
Of course you would say that.

13:06.458 --> 13:07.452
You wish you were white.

13:07.627 --> 13:08.871
Wh--how dare you?

13:09.038 --> 13:12.370
I happen to know what it means
to be proud of one's heritage.

13:12.547 --> 13:16.173
My great-great-great grandfather
was one of the few black men

13:16.335 --> 13:18.753
who had achieved an officer's rank
during the Civil War.

13:18.928 --> 13:24.011
This is a picture of him shaking hands
with Ulysses S. Grant.

13:24.176 --> 13:26.803
Yeah, let me check that out.

13:26.978 --> 13:30.142
I think he's shaking hands
with Robert E. Lee.

13:30.318 --> 13:34.772
Dude, your relative fought for the South.

13:35.068 --> 13:39.823
You're related to
a black Confederate officer.

13:41.328 --> 13:43.361
That's messed up.

13:43.608 --> 13:44.822
See?

13:44.998 --> 13:48.241
Now you know what I'm going through.

13:48.417 --> 13:54.043
Do you think these other black guys
are his prisoners or what?

13:54.206 --> 13:56.421
Maybe Jack's special could
be based on a holiday.

13:56.588 --> 13:58.290
What's left in April?

13:58.465 --> 14:02.380
Arbor Day, the Boston Marathon
and Hitler's birthday.

14:02.555 --> 14:05.802
So...you got options.

14:10.188 --> 14:11.141
Hey, Liz?

14:11.317 --> 14:12.063
- Hi.
- Hi. Hey.

14:12.225 --> 14:13.353
Could I-- can I talk to you for a sec?

14:13.526 --> 14:16.232
Yeah. All right.

14:16.397 --> 14:20.023
I'm sorry to do this at work,
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

14:20.195 --> 14:21.820
You weren't at the meeting today.

14:21.985 --> 14:23.571
Oh! No, I'm okay.

14:23.735 --> 14:24.943
Okay, good.

14:25.116 --> 14:27.280
I just wanna offer my support.

14:27.456 --> 14:29.660
If you ever need to talk to someone,

14:29.827 --> 14:33.413
I'd be more than happy
to take you out for coffee.

14:33.587 --> 14:35.833
[silently] No.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.960
Do you have time now?

14:38.125 --> 14:38.920
Sure.

14:39.085 --> 14:40.542
Okay.

14:40.717 --> 14:40.795
Oh.

14:40.795 --> 14:43.800
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

14:51.606 --> 14:52.603
All right, Tracy.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.600
I have the DNA results right here.

14:54.778 --> 14:58.020
Are you ready to find out who
your biological father is?

14:58.198 --> 14:59.483
I think I am.

14:59.657 --> 15:01.731
Tracy...

15:01.907 --> 15:05.233
Meet your father, Tom.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.611
No!

15:08.787 --> 15:10.321
I hate you, Thomas Jefferson!

15:10.496 --> 15:14.282
I don't know who I am anymore!

15:14.585 --> 15:16.162
Hey, Maury, he a dog.

15:16.335 --> 15:17.912
He a dog.

15:18.087 --> 15:20.622
Sally Hemings just called you
a dog, Thomas Jefferson.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.711
No matter, Maurence.

15:22.887 --> 15:25.092
I'm here for you, Tracy Jordan.

15:25.256 --> 15:28.973
I rode a horse all the way from heaven
to tell you something important.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.803
America, which I invented...

15:38.987 --> 15:41.193
which I invented,

15:41.356 --> 15:42.901
is a great country

15:43.065 --> 15:45.692
because we are not burdened by our pasts.

15:45.867 --> 15:49.531
Embrace who you are, Tracy Jordan.

15:49.708 --> 15:53.910
And may the Force be with you always.

16:01.465 --> 16:04.591
I have never seen so much
come out of one pigeon!

16:04.755 --> 16:06.251
Yeah, I think it might've been sick.

16:06.428 --> 16:10.762
Or maybe the little guy ate
a cigarette or something.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.383
Hey, do you wanna come over?

16:12.555 --> 16:13.800
My friend Pete is staying with me

16:13.978 --> 16:15.510
and we've decided
that we're gonna do this thing

16:15.685 --> 16:18.930
where every night we watch
one of the AFI top 100 movies.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.272
How many have you gone through?

16:20.435 --> 16:22.100
Well, I only have Star Wars and Tootsie,

16:22.278 --> 16:25.151
so we just keeping watching
those two over and over.

16:25.315 --> 16:26.612
I'm in.

16:26.775 --> 16:28.783
But only 'cause your friend's there.

16:28.945 --> 16:33.452
Otherwise it would be too tempting
for this to turn into a...a real date.

16:33.615 --> 16:34.782
What do you mean?

16:34.955 --> 16:36.372
Well...

16:36.537 --> 16:39.490
Obviously, since we're in the same group,
we can never date.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.660
It's against the rules.

16:41.836 --> 16:45.961
Right, but isn't that one of those rules like,
"don't walk between the subway cars,"

16:46.136 --> 16:48.053
and all the cool people
just do it anyway?

16:48.216 --> 16:51.550
Liz, I need the rules.

16:51.977 --> 16:53.513
The last time I drank I ended up doing

16:53.686 --> 16:57.301
a man-on-the street commercial
for Tarzan on Ice.

16:57.476 --> 16:58.761
It was awesome!

16:58.936 --> 17:02.941
I mean, he was swinging on his skates!

17:03.108 --> 17:06.153
And the little monkey was funny.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.442
I wanna see it again!

17:08.617 --> 17:09.943
- Yikes.
- Yeah.

17:10.117 --> 17:11.570
And I didn't even see it.

17:11.746 --> 17:13.991
- So all the rules.
- Yeah.

17:14.157 --> 17:17.661
But I'll buy the popcorn.

17:28.217 --> 17:29.883
Karate!

17:30.057 --> 17:32.461
Karate!

17:33.427 --> 17:35.841
Karate!

17:41.816 --> 17:43.731
Kenneth, what are you doing here?

17:43.897 --> 17:47.811
Well, I was in the neighborhood.

17:50.865 --> 17:51.860
Hmm.

17:52.035 --> 17:55.953
Do you want me to dance for you?

17:59.167 --> 18:00.583
Yeah.

18:00.745 --> 18:02.701
That's the business.

18:02.876 --> 18:03.413
Oh, man.

18:03.588 --> 18:04.751
Yeah.

18:04.915 --> 18:05.833
This is traffic on the twos.

18:06.006 --> 18:07.880
Top deck of the G.W. Bridge... (Devin) Yeah.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.383
Touch your belt buckle.

18:09.546 --> 18:10.751
Oh, touch the peacock.

18:10.927 --> 18:12.170
Construction on the Merritt causing slowdowns.

18:12.346 --> 18:13.300
Oh, you're a peacock.

18:13.465 --> 18:16.720
The time is now 7:52.

18:18.976 --> 18:20.431
7:52?

18:20.606 --> 18:21.933
You warlock!

18:22.108 --> 18:25.313
You came to entrance me.

18:25.486 --> 18:28.483
Donaghy sent you.

18:31.987 --> 18:32.821
Where the hell is Lemon?

18:32.988 --> 18:35.993
I can't find her.

18:48.217 --> 18:48.753
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

18:48.925 --> 18:51.003
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

18:51.176 --> 18:52.502
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:52.676 --> 18:54.342
I guess I kinda fell asleep on your legs.

18:54.518 --> 18:55.010
I know. It's weird.

18:55.176 --> 18:58.592
I've never let anybody put their head
that close to my feet before.

18:58.765 --> 18:59.842
Um, do you want some coffee?

19:00.017 --> 19:00.683
Aaagh.

19:00.847 --> 19:01.851
Oh boy.

19:02.018 --> 19:03.183
- Pins and needles.
- Are you all right?

19:03.357 --> 19:03.812
Aah!

19:03.975 --> 19:05.022
Both my legs are asleep.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.600
Okay, all right. Here we go. Come on.

19:06.777 --> 19:07.732
Hop up.

19:07.895 --> 19:08.891
Here we go.

19:09.066 --> 19:10.232
All right?

19:10.406 --> 19:13.731
Walk it off, scarecrow.

19:13.906 --> 19:15.781
That was really fun last night.

19:15.946 --> 19:16.903
I, uh...

19:17.076 --> 19:19.701
I think Tootsie's
a very well-crafted movie.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.663
Yeah, they use it as an example
in all the screenplay books.

19:22.827 --> 19:23.702
Oh.

19:23.875 --> 19:24.993
Look...

19:25.167 --> 19:28.251
I would really love
to do this again sometime, but I...

19:28.417 --> 19:30.000
You know, I don't think it's a good idea.

19:30.178 --> 19:30.542
Bye.

19:30.718 --> 19:32.883
I--

19:34.928 --> 19:37.011
Floyd, I'm not an alcoholic.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.303
I lied.

19:38.476 --> 19:40.841
I followed you to that church
because I have a crush on you

19:41.018 --> 19:42.511
and I let you think
that I belonged there.

19:42.686 --> 19:43.683
- What?
- I know.

19:43.858 --> 19:47.473
I know it makes me seem just
nut-log Ann Heche crazy,

19:47.646 --> 19:50.061
but if there's any way
that you could see past it--

19:50.237 --> 19:51.562
No!

19:51.737 --> 19:54.313
No, that--

19:55.118 --> 19:57.573
I said stuff in there
that even my best friends don't know.

19:57.736 --> 19:58.111
I know.

19:58.288 --> 19:59.743
That's supposed to be a safe place!

19:59.907 --> 20:00.611
I know.

20:00.785 --> 20:04.451
It is extremely not okay
that you did that!

20:04.625 --> 20:05.951
What are you still doing here?

20:06.125 --> 20:08.201
Don't you have
a breakfast meeting with Jack?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.160
Oh, oh!

20:10.336 --> 20:12.120
Floyd, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.382
No, no, no.
No, I'm--I'm going.

20:15.547 --> 20:22.183
I feel more confused and betrayed
than those people that worked with Tootsie.

20:25.188 --> 20:26.641
Bear with me. Sorry.

20:26.816 --> 20:29.561
Gentlemen, lady, if Jack's not ready,

20:29.736 --> 20:32.732
I'd like to tell you
about the future of entertainment.

20:32.906 --> 20:34.023
What am I talking about?

20:34.197 --> 20:35.731
Celebrity snuff.

20:35.905 --> 20:37.573
Reality content.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.942
Made exclusively for your mobile phone.

20:41.117 --> 20:42.402
Now, what's that?

20:42.578 --> 20:45.782
MC Lyte just murdered Danny Bonaduce?

20:45.958 --> 20:48.740
Oh, thanks, phone!

20:48.915 --> 20:51.211
Or...

20:51.795 --> 20:54.040
fireworks.

20:54.218 --> 20:55.002
What?

20:55.177 --> 20:57.211
Banks here wants to make TV smaller.

20:57.385 --> 21:00.300
But broadcast television is big.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.471
It's about spectacle.

21:01.637 --> 21:05.261
The kinds of shows we watched as kids
sitting on our neighbor's knee.

21:05.435 --> 21:08.972
Inaugurations, the Super Bowl, the Oscars.

21:09.147 --> 21:11.813
That's why we got into
television in the first place.

21:11.985 --> 21:14.142
That's why I give you...

21:14.315 --> 21:18.902
The Rockefeller Center Salute to Fireworks!

21:19.947 --> 21:23.702
Can you get those fireworks
that look like cowboy hats?

21:23.868 --> 21:26.661
You sure can.

21:27.247 --> 21:27.993
Thank you so much.

21:28.167 --> 21:29.873
I appreciate your patience.

21:30.046 --> 21:34.371
Mr. Donaghy, Liz Lemon is on the phone.

21:36.218 --> 21:38.172
Don't bother coming in, Lemon.
You're off the project.

21:38.346 --> 21:38.750
I'll do it without you.

21:38.928 --> 21:39.712
Jack, I'm so sorry.

21:39.888 --> 21:41.382
It's just, you know,
I told you about the Flower Guy and--

21:41.558 --> 21:42.552
I don't have time for this.

21:42.715 --> 21:44.262
You've made your priorities clear.

21:44.426 --> 21:47.683
I hope he's worth it.

21:57.528 --> 22:00.362
I found a biography on your ancestor.

22:00.526 --> 22:04.902
It's called, Confederate Monster:
The Tobias Spurlock Disaster.

22:05.077 --> 22:06.951
Yo, Toof, how you doing?

22:07.118 --> 22:08.033
Not good.

22:08.207 --> 22:12.203
The barn that John Wilkes Booth hid in
belonged to Tobias Spurlock.

22:12.378 --> 22:13.291
Well, listen.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.292
Dream Jefferson told me
some amazing stuff.

22:16.468 --> 22:19.423
He said it's not about
who you were,

22:19.598 --> 22:22.383
it's about who you are right now.

22:22.557 --> 22:23.511
No, Toofer.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.420
Give in to your heritage.

22:25.595 --> 22:28.010
Kill Tracy.

22:28.185 --> 22:29.641
Let me shoot something at you.

22:29.806 --> 22:32.100
I came up with a movie idea
about all of this.

22:32.265 --> 22:33.311
And I want you to write it.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.232
Okay, what's the movie?

22:36.396 --> 22:40.231
It's the story of Thomas Jefferson,
only thing we're gonna do it like Norbit,

22:40.407 --> 22:42.362
where I play all the parts.

22:42.525 --> 22:44.903
That's actually hilarious.

22:45.076 --> 22:46.530
It's not a comedy.

22:46.707 --> 22:47.990
It's a drama.

22:48.165 --> 22:50.322
Oh.

22:52.875 --> 22:54.830
Hi...um...

22:55.007 --> 22:59.000
I'm really sorry about what I did,
and I know that you can't forgive me.

22:59.176 --> 23:01.080
But just to even things out...

23:01.258 --> 23:04.093
here's all of my weird secret stuff.

23:04.255 --> 23:08.550
I have been sexually rejected
by not one, but two guys

23:08.725 --> 23:10.842
who later went to Clown College.

23:11.018 --> 23:13.973
I get super nervous whenever I hear
a vacuum cleaner because when I was a kid,

23:14.146 --> 23:16.102
my mom used to turn on the vacuum

23:16.275 --> 23:18.350
to drown out the sound of her
and my dad fighting.

23:18.526 --> 23:21.192
Which is why I rarely
vacuum my apartment.

23:21.365 --> 23:23.690
Like...never.

23:23.865 --> 23:26.820
I have had three donuts so far today.

23:26.996 --> 23:29.400
Uh, once in college,
I pooped my pants a little bit

23:29.576 --> 23:32.572
at a Country Steaks
all-you-can-eat buffet,

23:32.747 --> 23:37.413
and I didn't leave
until I finished my second plate of shrimp.

23:37.585 --> 23:40.121
A couple months of ago
I went on a date with my cousin.

23:40.295 --> 23:42.751
Wow, I-- I am a mess.

23:42.925 --> 23:44.461
There is an 80% chance

23:44.638 --> 23:46.841
in the next election
that I will tell all my friends

23:47.015 --> 23:50.260
I am voting for Barack Obama,
but I will secretly vote for John McCain.

23:50.438 --> 23:51.263
Here's one, um...

23:51.438 --> 23:52.303
when I was a kid,

23:52.475 --> 23:56.273
I used to put on my fanciest nightgown
and then I would mix orange soda

23:56.437 --> 23:58.231
and cream soda in a champagne glass

23:58.395 --> 24:00.980
and I would sit in the dark
and watch The Love Boat.

24:01.148 --> 24:05.482
Consequently, I have some weird sexual
fantasy stuff about Gopher from The Love Boat.

24:05.656 --> 24:08.440
And I...lied.

24:09.246 --> 24:12.610
I have had five donuts today.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.283
So, um...that's my deal.

24:15.458 --> 24:18.372
Now we're even.

24:18.628 --> 24:20.752
Liz.

24:20.917 --> 24:25.000
You know, the Roomba is a nice,
quiet alternative to a vacuum.

24:25.178 --> 24:27.251
Thank you, that's uh...
that's a good tip.

24:27.428 --> 24:32.932
And in the interest of full disclosure,
I also have a sexual fantasy about Gopher.

24:33.097 --> 24:36.103
Except mine's the one from Caddyshack.

24:36.265 --> 24:41.521
Well, that makes sense
'cause he's a very good dancer.

24:51.746 --> 24:54.240
* Sky rockets in flight

24:54.417 --> 24:57.281
* Afternoon at night

24:57.455 --> 24:58.411
Oh, boy.

24:58.585 --> 25:01.501
I really should've been at that meeting.

25:01.667 --> 25:05.380
Welcome to the Rockefeller
Center Salute to Fireworks!

25:05.547 --> 25:10.553
Now without further ado,
three hours of fireworks!

25:14.597 --> 25:15.762
Wait, fireworks?

25:15.938 --> 25:17.050
In Midtown?

25:17.225 --> 25:21.603
On a day that is not the Fourth of July?

25:22.068 --> 25:24.022
Oh, my God.

25:24.195 --> 25:24.851
Oh, boy.

25:25.026 --> 25:29.113
That's gonna scare a lot of people.

25:34.996 --> 25:37.910
Sir, the Mayor.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.502
Shut it down!

25:43.215 --> 25:46.000
Shut it down!

25:48.927 --> 25:49.841
Oh, boy.

25:50.005 --> 25:53.132
Oh, the cowboy hat.

25:54.305 --> 26:00.273
