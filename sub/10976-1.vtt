02:42.412 --> 02:44.998
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

02:55.259 --> 02:56.510
Barbara?

03:04.310 --> 03:07.396
Did you hear that? I could have sworn
I heard whispering.

03:09.148 --> 03:11.360
You're reading my mind, thas all.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.945
My thoughts sound like whispers.

03:14.654 --> 03:15.697
Yeah?

03:16.198 --> 03:17.908
What were you thinking?

03:18.742 --> 03:20.160
I love you, Doc.

03:20.702 --> 03:24.331
You sure make it fun to wake up
before dawn, I'll tell you that.

04:43.873 --> 04:44.915
Frank?

05:03.018 --> 05:05.688
- Did you finish last night?
- No.

05:07.148 --> 05:09.442
Honey, is a quarter to 6:00.

05:10.151 --> 05:11.444
Is important.

05:12.445 --> 05:13.488
Okay.

05:17.158 --> 05:18.201
Thanks.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.007
Okay.

05:32.883 --> 05:34.343
Thas everything.

05:36.512 --> 05:38.180
Helium for the balloons!

05:38.263 --> 05:41.850
I'm picking up a tank at Harolďs
right after I drop you off...

05:41.934 --> 05:43.687
...per your instructions.

05:43.770 --> 05:46.231
Did I think of that? Cool.

05:46.606 --> 05:49.943
I must be starting to get
this delegating authority stuff.

05:50.235 --> 05:54.280
Well, Mrs. Magoo,
I guess thas why they made you principal.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.408
I guess so.

05:58.451 --> 06:02.331
- Honey, don't smoke.
- Come on! You're going to make me crash.

06:02.998 --> 06:06.502
I'll quit smoking when you decide
to get pregnant, all right?

06:17.555 --> 06:18.681
Guys!

06:24.730 --> 06:26.815
- Hi!
- Hi.

06:33.613 --> 06:35.365
- Be careful.
- Here I come.

06:35.490 --> 06:36.867
Watch your step.

06:42.957 --> 06:44.208
You all right?

06:46.544 --> 06:47.587
Jill!

06:52.467 --> 06:54.385
- Who's the chef?
- Oliver.

06:54.469 --> 06:56.679
Great, I love burnt hot dogs.

06:57.764 --> 06:59.725
Thanks. So when's Ben coming home?

06:59.808 --> 07:03.395
Six weeks, four days and nine hours.

07:06.023 --> 07:08.984
- Okay, watch the edges. Don't spill it.
- I got it.

07:09.068 --> 07:10.903
Les take it over here.

07:11.236 --> 07:13.989
- Callie, how are you?
- Frank. Good. Good to see you.

07:14.073 --> 07:15.532
Where's my helium?

07:15.949 --> 07:19.412
- Say you love me, baby.
- Not until you get me my helium.

07:19.704 --> 07:22.082
Righty-o. I'll get right on it, dear.

07:25.001 --> 07:27.045
- You go here.
- Okay.

07:27.128 --> 07:29.798
There's Jill. I've got those receipts here.

07:30.757 --> 07:33.093
- How you doing?
- How the hell are you?

07:34.427 --> 07:36.763
- All right, bye.
- Bye. See you later.

07:48.651 --> 07:50.486
- Barbara!
- Frank!

07:53.114 --> 07:54.490
Good morning, Sam.

07:54.573 --> 07:57.744
And you must be Cindy.
Is nice to finally meet you.

08:00.122 --> 08:02.290
Do you want to take a look around?

08:03.834 --> 08:05.544
You'll really love this place.

08:22.311 --> 08:24.063
- Harold.
- Morning, Doc.

08:24.188 --> 08:26.357
- Frank.
- Doc, how the hell are you?

08:26.899 --> 08:28.985
Heading over to the school fair?

08:29.068 --> 08:32.280
I have to go to Butler County and
make my rounds at the hospital.

08:32.363 --> 08:34.658
You've got to try
this muscle machine I made.

08:34.741 --> 08:36.702
Show everybody how strong you are.

08:36.784 --> 08:37.745
I don't know.

08:37.828 --> 08:41.789
I should probably sit in the shade
and watch you young guys do it.

08:44.626 --> 08:46.462
- See you, tough guy.
- Right.

08:54.137 --> 08:55.346
Okay. Thanks, Jill.

08:55.430 --> 08:57.098
We need finger paints.

08:57.265 --> 08:59.100
Okay. I'll get them.

09:00.894 --> 09:02.479
Just put it on the table.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.621
Finger paints. Okay.

09:27.630 --> 09:28.672
Yikes.

11:11.406 --> 11:13.825
Well, a civilian pilot spots the smoke.

11:14.242 --> 11:18.121
Then I get here and find two
of my officers passed out like babies.

11:18.330 --> 11:21.416
Everything on that side
of the white line is out cold.

11:21.875 --> 11:25.003
So somebody starts talking
about chemical weapons...

11:25.087 --> 11:29.008
...and somebody hits a panic button,
and then you people are calling.

11:30.134 --> 11:32.845
- There you go.
- Look, there is no research lab.

11:32.929 --> 11:34.931
There is no chemical plant.

11:35.139 --> 11:38.935
There is no toxic waste dump.
There is no nuclear plant!

11:39.185 --> 11:41.562
- There's no nothing around here.
- Okay.

11:43.815 --> 11:47.528
Nothing on the news channels
or news services. Nobody's got it yet.

11:47.611 --> 11:48.654
Good.

11:50.823 --> 11:53.992
I'm just going to take myself in there
and get a look-see.

12:03.961 --> 12:05.004
Ed.

12:05.380 --> 12:08.383
- Thas Frank McGowan's truck, right?
- Whas left of it.

12:08.466 --> 12:11.886
- Lucky you weren't in town today, Doc.
- Whas going on here?

12:11.970 --> 12:15.140
Nobody knows anything,
not even that fed doctor down there.

12:15.223 --> 12:18.977
She brought this whole circus with her,
and they don't have a clue.

12:33.075 --> 12:36.620
Go on out there and see
what the hell's going on. Be careful.

12:36.704 --> 12:39.040
- Stay here?
- Yeah, we're just waiting.

12:39.331 --> 12:40.708
All right, good.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.692
Pull him back!
Get him out of there! Les go!

13:07.779 --> 13:09.030
Get him down!

13:09.280 --> 13:10.990
- Stay back!
- Excuse me.

13:11.657 --> 13:13.910
Hits him like a hammer.
Thas all we know.

13:13.993 --> 13:16.746
- Some kind of chemical gas?
- No, it can't be.

13:16.913 --> 13:19.749
The edges of the affected area
are well-defined.

13:20.626 --> 13:21.710
Stationary.

13:21.794 --> 13:24.755
- Doc, this is Dr. Susan...
- Vurner.

13:25.255 --> 13:27.091
Like Turner, with a "V."

13:27.508 --> 13:30.052
Epidemiologist,
National Science Foundation.

13:30.135 --> 13:32.054
- Alan Chaffee.
- MD?

13:32.346 --> 13:35.766
He's breathing. Good pulse.
I think he just fainted.

13:36.392 --> 13:38.060
Is Midwich affected by this?

13:38.143 --> 13:40.605
- My hunch would be, yes.
- My wife's in Midwich.

13:40.688 --> 13:44.484
We tried calling for the last six hours.
Nobody picks up or calls out.

13:44.567 --> 13:47.904
Could somebody please get me
some blood and urine samples?

13:50.490 --> 13:52.450
- Whas the call?
- 98.

13:54.327 --> 13:56.246
You going? Okay, all right.

13:57.122 --> 13:59.834
Just take it easy.
Somebody get him a blanket.

14:56.935 --> 14:58.395
What happened?

16:03.213 --> 16:04.256
Barbara?

16:05.966 --> 16:07.968
Thank God. Are you all right?

16:10.429 --> 16:12.140
Sweetheart, are you okay?

16:12.682 --> 16:16.227
- I'm cold.
- All right, come on. Les go home.

17:02.734 --> 17:03.777
No.

17:07.655 --> 17:09.116
Heavenly Father...

17:09.825 --> 17:12.578
...we mourn these lives cut short...

17:13.369 --> 17:16.207
...without warning or apparent purpose.

17:16.999 --> 17:20.252
We search for a reason and find none.

17:22.088 --> 17:25.132
We have become accustomed
to the power of science...

17:25.590 --> 17:29.721
...so when we were struck down,
we turned to science and asked, "Why?"

17:30.889 --> 17:32.599
But it could not answer.

17:33.433 --> 17:35.936
So now we turn our eyes toward Heaven...

17:36.311 --> 17:40.023
...and seek our comfort
in Goďs infinite mercy.

17:41.691 --> 17:42.901
Let us pray.

17:44.152 --> 17:46.823
"Our Father, who art in Heaven...

17:47.281 --> 17:48.908
"...hallowed be Thy name...

17:48.991 --> 17:51.828
"...Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done...

17:51.911 --> 17:53.996
"...on Earth as it is in Heaven.

17:54.414 --> 17:57.208
"Give us this day our daily bread...

17:57.542 --> 17:59.752
"...and forgive us our trespasses...

17:59.836 --> 18:02.839
"...as we forgive those
who trespass against us...

18:03.214 --> 18:05.550
"...and lead us not into temptation...

18:05.717 --> 18:07.553
"...but deliver us from evil.

18:07.636 --> 18:10.514
"For Thine is the kingdom, and the power...

18:10.597 --> 18:13.308
"...and the glory, forever and ever.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.643
"Amen."

18:56.729 --> 18:58.981
Did you ever hear of Charles Fort?

18:59.690 --> 19:03.737
He wrote The Book of the Damned,
about unexplainable things.

19:04.446 --> 19:07.824
Like frogs falling from the sky,
blue snow, red rain...

19:08.075 --> 19:09.951
Are you suggesting I read him?

19:10.035 --> 19:11.745
No. Is just that...

19:12.496 --> 19:15.040
Sometimes mysteries don't get solved.

19:15.707 --> 19:18.627
I mean, what if something
like this happens again?

19:18.752 --> 19:21.421
I don't know. What do I do?
Can I call you?

19:21.505 --> 19:23.674
Well, of course, you can call me.

19:24.217 --> 19:28.429
By the way,
I suggest you read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

19:28.805 --> 19:30.598
Sherlock Holmes once said:

19:30.807 --> 19:35.186
"When you've eliminated the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable...

19:35.311 --> 19:36.896
"...must be the truth."

20:00.380 --> 20:02.048
Is not possible.

20:03.258 --> 20:06.261
You made a mistake. Do it again.

20:07.721 --> 20:10.557
Well, I don't have a problem
running the tests again...

20:10.640 --> 20:14.978
I have felt like this before in the morning.
It is just some kind of bug.

20:32.288 --> 20:33.330
Melanie?

20:49.306 --> 20:50.766
Whas the matter?

20:55.729 --> 20:57.857
- Maybe I can help.
- No.

20:58.483 --> 20:59.609
You can't.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.200
- There they are!
- Hey, guys!

21:07.283 --> 21:09.619
We're empty! We need some more here!

21:09.994 --> 21:11.662
Hi, how are you?

21:12.371 --> 21:13.790
Is good to see you.

21:13.873 --> 21:14.916
Hi.

21:22.424 --> 21:24.176
Ben, this is fantastic.

21:34.645 --> 21:36.731
Callie, look up and smile.

21:44.489 --> 21:46.658
Ben, after a year in Japan...

21:46.741 --> 21:50.203
...did you ever think you'd have
to get used to being a dad?

22:09.181 --> 22:10.349
Hello, Doc.

22:13.310 --> 22:14.688
I said, "Hello."

22:16.773 --> 22:20.026
- How long have you been standing there?
- Ages.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.403
Liar.

22:24.614 --> 22:25.991
Big boy.

22:32.330 --> 22:34.417
Why are you kissing me like that?

22:35.877 --> 22:39.088
I wanted to know first,
so I used a home pregnancy kit.

22:39.964 --> 22:42.759
Honey, you know those are unreliable.

22:43.217 --> 22:46.429
And thas why I went to see
Dr. Cornright just to make sure.

22:46.763 --> 22:48.264
Are you going to open it?

22:57.316 --> 22:58.484
Alan?

23:08.452 --> 23:10.245
Hi. You got a minute?

23:10.454 --> 23:11.498
Sure.

23:24.803 --> 23:26.554
Everything's positive.

23:27.514 --> 23:28.973
You are pregnant.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.441
We'd been trying, you know.

23:38.317 --> 23:39.652
Look.

23:40.653 --> 23:44.281
I wanted to tell you something
before you hear it from somebody else.

23:45.199 --> 23:46.992
There are a lot of pregnancies.

23:47.076 --> 23:48.787
I mean, a lot.

23:49.830 --> 23:53.291
Much more than would
normally be expected.

23:54.709 --> 23:56.336
What do you mean?

24:00.966 --> 24:02.968
Is something wrong with my baby?

24:03.468 --> 24:07.890
No, is nothing to indicate that.
You're a normal, healthy young woman...

24:07.974 --> 24:10.935
Alan, don't talk to me like a doctor.

24:12.103 --> 24:13.229
Okay.

24:15.022 --> 24:18.985
All the pregnancies seem to date
from the day of the blackout.

24:19.152 --> 24:20.611
No!

24:32.958 --> 24:34.793
Dr. Susan Vurner has flown in...

24:34.877 --> 24:37.796
This is all because of that blackout, isn't it?

24:38.797 --> 24:42.384
- Just come out and say something!
- They don't know for sure!

24:42.634 --> 24:44.762
They are all going to be deformed!

24:48.141 --> 24:50.143
Wait a minute. Thas not true!

24:50.226 --> 24:53.772
Excuse me! Thas not true.
There's no reason to believe that.

24:53.855 --> 24:56.775
Barbara and I are pregnant.
We know how you feel.

24:56.858 --> 24:59.736
We know what you are thinking,
so let me say right now...

24:59.819 --> 25:02.572
...the same thing
I've told a lot of you individually.

25:02.655 --> 25:05.576
The standard tests have not revealed
one abnormality.

25:05.659 --> 25:08.454
Anywhere. Not one. All right?

25:08.537 --> 25:11.707
Les listen to Dr. Vurner, please.

25:11.791 --> 25:15.461
She's come to talk to us.
Dr. Susan Vurner, ladies and gentlemen.

25:18.214 --> 25:22.510
I want to start off by saying we are all
very concerned about your well-being.

25:24.763 --> 25:28.100
But ultimately it will come down
to individual decisions.

25:28.767 --> 25:32.896
And I understand that these decisions
will be probably the most intimate...

25:32.979 --> 25:37.359
...personal, difficult decisions
that you ever make in your life.

25:37.901 --> 25:42.614
However, because your pregnancies
have attracted intense scientific interest...

25:42.697 --> 25:46.702
...including the National Institutes of
Health and National Science Foundation...

25:46.828 --> 25:49.914
...those of you who decide
to have your child...

25:50.289 --> 25:52.792
...will have all prenatal expenses paid.

25:52.917 --> 25:56.754
You'll also receive $3,000 monthly
as an allowance.

25:59.215 --> 26:04.596
If you allow your child to be examined
and tested on some sort of regular basis.

26:04.847 --> 26:07.516
Is that $3,000 a family?

26:07.724 --> 26:10.644
What if your wife and your daughter
both have kids?

26:10.894 --> 26:13.355
Then you would receive $6,000.

26:14.064 --> 26:15.983
$6,000?

26:19.653 --> 26:24.576
I don't want you to interpret this allowance
as some sort of a pressure.

26:25.118 --> 26:26.828
It isn't. Is your decision.

26:26.911 --> 26:32.041
If you decide to terminate then, of course,
you have the right to do that.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.669
You can do it privately.

26:34.794 --> 26:38.757
Or if financially unable, a medical team
will be brought in next week.

26:39.382 --> 26:42.052
- The choice is yours.
- Thas killing babies.

26:48.893 --> 26:50.853
Are you okay?

26:52.354 --> 26:54.273
Ben's moving out.

26:56.609 --> 26:58.402
He won't believe me.

27:01.031 --> 27:02.657
What are you going to do?

27:04.409 --> 27:05.952
I can't keep it.

27:07.079 --> 27:09.206
I mean, it can't be Ben's.

27:10.665 --> 27:12.542
I just don't...

27:12.959 --> 27:15.087
I just don't understand.

27:17.297 --> 27:20.593
Something very strange is happening
to all of us, Callie.

27:22.970 --> 27:24.931
You know, they say...

27:25.807 --> 27:28.101
...the Roberts' girl is a virgin.

27:31.229 --> 27:32.939
What are you going to do?

27:34.357 --> 27:35.775
I don't know.

27:38.904 --> 27:40.280
I don't know.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.300
- You all right?
- Yeah.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.346
It was just a dream.

28:45.432 --> 28:46.475
Okay.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.646
Les go back to sleep.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.368
Whas going on, doctor?

29:05.203 --> 29:06.579
Nothing.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.334
They have apparently decided
to keep their babies.

29:11.709 --> 29:12.961
All of them?

29:13.504 --> 29:14.755
Why?

29:16.006 --> 29:17.925
Thas a very good question.

30:34.213 --> 30:36.299
Keep pushing! Push!

30:37.300 --> 30:39.594
Okay, here we go. Here we go. Almost.

30:39.677 --> 30:42.388
Almost done! Good, Mom. Thas good.

30:42.597 --> 30:44.766
Push, push, push.

30:50.647 --> 30:52.232
Thas it. Thas it.

30:54.568 --> 30:57.070
You're doing great! Take a deep breath.

30:57.154 --> 30:58.989
Deep breath and push!

30:59.072 --> 31:00.824
Push, push, push!

31:01.241 --> 31:03.786
Come with that. Push a little more.

31:04.578 --> 31:07.874
- Push, Barbara, push.
- A little more. A little more.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.959
Push. Push.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.050
Help me!

31:18.093 --> 31:19.636
We've got a problem!

31:21.096 --> 31:23.139
ICU, now!

31:34.610 --> 31:36.529
- Push, push, push!
- Come on!

31:36.946 --> 31:39.073
- There we go!
- Good, Barbara!

31:39.198 --> 31:40.741
And there we go.

31:40.825 --> 31:42.743
Beauty! Looking great, sweetie.

31:42.827 --> 31:44.245
Good job.

31:44.412 --> 31:45.956
Is a girl, honey.

31:47.374 --> 31:48.542
She's fine.

31:51.378 --> 31:56.049
- There we are. Clamp this.
- Look, here's your baby.

32:03.975 --> 32:05.268
He's beautiful.

32:19.115 --> 32:20.491
Ben.

32:25.998 --> 32:28.876
Come on, just breathe once. Oxygen.

32:28.959 --> 32:32.087
- Watch the BP.
- Just relax. You're hyperventilating.

32:33.297 --> 32:36.675
Push. Doctor, get your ass over here
and help me!

32:38.218 --> 32:40.137
Bear down on her! Push!

32:40.929 --> 32:44.809
All right, here we go!
Come on, push! Give me one big push!

32:45.435 --> 32:48.062
Come on, here we go! Come on!

32:51.107 --> 32:53.193
I'm sorry. Is stillborn.

32:58.907 --> 33:00.533
Get some fluid in her.

33:37.405 --> 33:39.700
How we doing? Everything all right?

33:39.784 --> 33:41.577
We lost the Roberts' baby.

33:42.870 --> 33:46.165
- God. How?
- Respiratory failure.

33:46.916 --> 33:48.751
Umbilical asphyxia.

34:15.112 --> 34:19.199
Where did you take the baby?
I saw you take Melanie's baby outside.

34:19.409 --> 34:23.496
I took the baby for an autopsy.
I didn't want the other mothers to see.

34:55.947 --> 34:57.616
I baptize thee...

34:58.074 --> 35:00.202
...in the name of the Father...

35:00.410 --> 35:04.998
...and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

35:08.460 --> 35:09.878
I got you.

35:11.838 --> 35:13.090
Yes.

35:17.428 --> 35:18.679
Let us pray.

35:19.680 --> 35:24.852
Heavenly Father, we thank you
that by the water of the Holy Spirit...

35:24.936 --> 35:28.397
...you have bestowed upon
your servants, the forgiveness of sin...

35:28.481 --> 35:31.109
...and have raised them
to the new life of grace.

35:31.192 --> 35:34.071
"Sustain them, O Lord, in your Holy Spirit.

35:34.196 --> 35:36.907
"Give them an inquiring
and discerning heart...

35:37.199 --> 35:39.910
"...the courage to will and to persevere...

35:40.077 --> 35:42.663
"...the spirit to know and to love you...

35:42.746 --> 35:46.416
"...and the gift of wonder and joy
in all your work. Amen."

35:46.792 --> 35:47.960
Amen.

36:05.270 --> 36:06.604
Good girl.

36:07.355 --> 36:08.940
Thas a good girl.

36:10.692 --> 36:14.655
Note how the section of hair is flat
on one side then arced on the other...

36:14.738 --> 36:16.782
...like a capital "D."
- Right.

36:18.117 --> 36:21.454
The texture is...
I don't know. Is unusually soft.

36:24.123 --> 36:26.750
What did you think
when you looked at her nails?

36:26.834 --> 36:28.836
Narrower than normal.

36:29.795 --> 36:32.132
Any results yet from the DNA testing?

36:32.466 --> 36:34.468
Common genetic characteristics.

36:34.551 --> 36:37.679
Almost as if they are siblings
from the same parent.

36:39.681 --> 36:42.601
Is way too early
to have anything conclusive.

36:46.104 --> 36:47.355
Baby.

36:48.148 --> 36:49.817
What are you doing?

37:04.415 --> 37:06.626
You can spell your name.

37:10.297 --> 37:12.216
How can you spell your name?

37:15.511 --> 37:17.429
How can Mommy's...

37:18.138 --> 37:20.682
...smart little boy spell his name?

37:32.487 --> 37:34.572
Sweetie, was the soup too hot?

37:47.920 --> 37:49.547
Okay, baby.

37:49.672 --> 37:52.591
We're going to go see our friend Mara.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.355
Barbara?

39:01.497 --> 39:03.082
Are you crazy?

39:14.844 --> 39:17.347
Honey, can't you tell me what happened?

41:12.384 --> 41:13.677
Don't!

41:13.886 --> 41:16.306
No! God, no!

41:26.358 --> 41:29.111
I understand there are
recent developments at Midwich.

41:30.362 --> 41:31.738
Yes.

41:32.197 --> 41:35.701
The children are beginning to interact
more with the general community.

41:35.952 --> 41:37.620
There have been casualties...

41:37.703 --> 41:39.872
I should say accidents, suicides...

41:39.956 --> 41:42.667
...that might be related to
contact with the children.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.169
But no direct physical
violence was involved.

41:45.795 --> 41:49.841
I have also been trying unsuccessfully
to get Dr. Chaffee back on the program.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.426
His daughter's the leader, isn't she?

41:52.593 --> 41:54.513
He's probably got his hands full.

41:54.721 --> 41:57.307
Personal considerations aren't important,
are they?

41:58.475 --> 42:02.354
I think that the opportunity to study
these children should take precedent...

42:02.437 --> 42:04.356
...over any considerations.

42:06.150 --> 42:08.068
Les cut to the chase here.

42:08.152 --> 42:11.196
Is now of interest
to national security that we continue...

42:11.280 --> 42:14.159
...to carefully monitor
their developing powers.

42:17.328 --> 42:19.372
I ask for another year's grant.

43:33.700 --> 43:35.661
Good afternoon, children.

43:40.582 --> 43:42.000
Why do you smile?

43:42.334 --> 43:45.254
You're trying to hide
your thoughts from us.

43:47.089 --> 43:49.092
Just how deeply do you see?

43:49.175 --> 43:51.928
Everything active in your mind.

43:52.220 --> 43:56.266
But the process that leads
to the spoken words eludes us.

43:56.724 --> 44:00.812
Why do you speak some thoughts
and not others?

44:02.230 --> 44:05.400
Wouldn't it be a noisy world
if we said everything we thought?

44:17.371 --> 44:19.123
Okay, I'm going to put a drop of this
in your eyes; it won't hurt.

44:57.872 --> 44:59.665
I'm sorry. Calm down!

44:59.749 --> 45:01.876
I'm going to wash your eye out!

45:02.627 --> 45:05.798
Okay, open your eyes! Is all right!

45:07.466 --> 45:09.301
Is okay!

46:20.751 --> 46:22.670
How's the doctor?

46:23.921 --> 46:25.548
Corneal scarring.

46:25.923 --> 46:27.842
Most likely permanent blindness.

46:27.925 --> 46:29.719
How did it happen?

46:29.844 --> 46:31.762
Doesn't remember much.

46:32.054 --> 46:34.474
It will be listed as an accident.

46:36.559 --> 46:38.311
It was the children.

46:38.936 --> 46:40.481
There's no proof of that.

46:42.107 --> 46:43.859
What I want to know is...

46:43.942 --> 46:46.361
...are the people in this town safe?

46:48.113 --> 46:50.866
- What are they going to do to us?
- Alan.

46:51.700 --> 46:53.869
- Hi.
- This has got to stop.

46:53.952 --> 46:56.455
They don't belong in regular classes.

46:56.663 --> 46:59.626
Is getting dangerous,
the other children can't learn.

47:00.418 --> 47:02.629
I was thinking
maybe you could teach them.

47:02.921 --> 47:05.131
They seem to respect you.

47:05.423 --> 47:06.424
Respect?

47:06.841 --> 47:09.594
No. They don't even know
the meaning of that word.

47:09.677 --> 47:12.889
Why bother? It doesn't make
any difference what we do.

47:15.517 --> 47:17.477
We need you.

47:18.437 --> 47:20.064
What am I going to teach them?

47:20.147 --> 47:23.067
What am I possibly going to teach them?

47:24.235 --> 47:25.694
Humanity.

47:31.367 --> 47:33.327
Humanity.

47:42.838 --> 47:45.340
Hello, sweetheart.

47:56.811 --> 47:58.729
Come on.

48:27.384 --> 48:30.596
There's no need for you
to become emotional.

48:31.263 --> 48:34.434
I'm old enough to do things by myself.

48:51.659 --> 48:54.747
Do you want to talk about what
happened at the clinic today?

48:55.080 --> 48:59.210
Why should I be experiencing emotion
at this moment?

49:01.796 --> 49:04.089
What is that word you're thinking?

49:04.632 --> 49:07.259
What is "empathy"?

49:11.722 --> 49:15.185
So if I have felt pain...

49:15.352 --> 49:19.856
...I should be able to identify with others
who feel pain.

49:22.859 --> 49:24.402
Yes.

49:35.873 --> 49:37.583
Good night.

50:47.949 --> 50:49.409
Whas the matter?

50:53.413 --> 50:54.998
You want some?

50:57.667 --> 50:59.586
I'm sorry.

51:01.630 --> 51:03.632
I just can't hack it.

51:46.386 --> 51:47.387
"God said...

51:48.346 --> 51:51.516
"...Let us make man in our image...

51:52.517 --> 51:54.602
"...after our likeness."

51:55.812 --> 51:58.898
But "image" does not mean outer image...

51:59.065 --> 52:03.529
...or every statue
or photograph would be man.

52:04.655 --> 52:07.533
It means the inner image.

52:08.492 --> 52:11.495
The spirit, the soul.

52:14.415 --> 52:16.375
So we gather here today...

52:16.917 --> 52:19.170
...to remember the inner beauty...

52:20.004 --> 52:22.299
...of one who lost her hold.

52:22.382 --> 52:24.009
Melanie Roberts...

52:24.509 --> 52:28.388
...somehow lost that image of herself
as a creature...

52:28.889 --> 52:32.350
...made in Goďs bountiful spirit.

52:33.727 --> 52:36.062
But what of those in our midst...

52:37.147 --> 52:40.192
...who do not have individual souls...

52:41.151 --> 52:43.112
...or spirits?

52:43.571 --> 52:46.032
They have one mind...

52:46.324 --> 52:48.826
...that they share between them.

52:49.035 --> 52:51.162
One spirit.

52:52.663 --> 52:54.999
And they have the look of man.

52:56.459 --> 52:59.003
But not the nature of mankind.

53:05.010 --> 53:06.970
What are you doing here?

53:07.971 --> 53:09.807
Looking for the baby.

53:13.852 --> 53:16.355
The one who was born with us.

53:16.605 --> 53:18.857
The one who died.

53:20.735 --> 53:22.737
How do you know about that?

53:25.281 --> 53:26.991
The baby's not here.

53:27.325 --> 53:29.035
She was taken away.

53:29.118 --> 53:30.537
Where?

53:31.120 --> 53:32.622
I don't know.

53:37.460 --> 53:40.297
Do you have a memory of the baby?

53:43.676 --> 53:45.678
But it bothers you.

53:48.556 --> 53:50.683
It hurts to lose a loved one.

53:52.059 --> 53:54.436
She was to be with me.

53:56.647 --> 53:58.525
We were to be together.

54:01.153 --> 54:03.572
How do you know that?

54:20.381 --> 54:22.550
You've lost someone too.

55:08.848 --> 55:10.642
I think I can teach them.

55:11.601 --> 55:13.436
Anyway, I'll try.

55:14.563 --> 55:17.316
I never told David about the Roberts' baby.

55:20.402 --> 55:21.445
Right.

55:21.946 --> 55:25.157
And then he said,
"she was to be with me"?

55:25.616 --> 55:27.409
What did that mean?

55:28.160 --> 55:29.578
I don't know.

55:36.503 --> 55:38.421
Are they paired up...

55:38.713 --> 55:40.423
...like a mate?

56:04.240 --> 56:07.743
What can I teach
such bright young students?

56:09.662 --> 56:11.206
What about human physiology?

56:11.290 --> 56:14.459
Thas at least something
I know a little bit about.

56:14.751 --> 56:17.546
For example, does anybody here know
how the eye works?

56:17.629 --> 56:20.299
Do you mean how do we see, or...

56:20.382 --> 56:22.092
Well, what else can the eye do?

56:22.593 --> 56:26.430
- The eyes are...
- The eyes are the windows of the soul.

56:26.972 --> 56:28.056
Yes.

56:28.307 --> 56:31.436
Thas right.
I see that you've been reading proverbs.

56:31.519 --> 56:33.062
I was speaking to Robert.

56:34.731 --> 56:38.401
The eyes are the windows of the soul.

56:46.993 --> 56:50.915
All right, if you'd rather
talk about philosophy instead of...

56:51.332 --> 56:54.877
...physiology, les talk about the soul.
- Alan.

56:55.252 --> 56:56.253
Sorry.

56:56.337 --> 56:59.131
Can you come to my office
for a minute, please?

56:59.965 --> 57:02.259
Yes. I'll be right there.

57:03.010 --> 57:07.097
While I'm away, why don't you each take
out a volume of the encyclopedia...

57:16.566 --> 57:19.694
...and try to learn a little
something about our culture.

57:39.841 --> 57:41.551
I know your game.

57:42.510 --> 57:44.720
I know what you're up to.

57:44.846 --> 57:47.349
Ever since you got here,
I've been watching.

57:48.141 --> 57:51.061
Watching people leave this town.

57:51.270 --> 57:53.856
Watching things die.

57:54.106 --> 57:57.025
You aren't right. None of you.

57:57.151 --> 58:00.821
And one of these days, somebody's
going to do something about it.

58:03.657 --> 58:06.536
I don't like the way
you're looking at me, boy.

58:11.332 --> 58:14.502
I got a gun, too, and I'm not the only one.

58:14.836 --> 58:18.965
One day somebody's going to get up
on a rooftop...

58:19.090 --> 58:22.427
...and start picking you little bastards off.

58:22.677 --> 58:26.140
One by one by one.

58:39.904 --> 58:41.697
Aren't you going to do something?

58:41.780 --> 58:45.202
Aren't you going to bawl
like all the other little pissants?

58:46.161 --> 58:48.705
Well, do something, damn it!

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:51.626
There are going to be changes.

01:01:04.973 --> 01:01:06.683
God help us.

01:01:07.184 --> 01:01:08.602
The children did it.

01:01:08.685 --> 01:01:10.562
I know they did it.

01:01:10.896 --> 01:01:12.773
And my daughter was involved.

01:01:13.565 --> 01:01:15.527
Now, who are they?

01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:18.530
I first thought they were
a form of mutation.

01:01:18.613 --> 01:01:20.907
Some abrupt evolutionary jump.

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:23.993
It was their communal consciousness...

01:01:24.327 --> 01:01:26.496
...but I couldn't explain the blackout.

01:01:27.247 --> 01:01:29.332
Or the mass pregnancies.

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:33.169
Midwich isn't the only colony
of such children.

01:01:35.673 --> 01:01:39.468
In a township in northern Australia,
30 infants were born in a single day.

01:01:40.761 --> 01:01:42.847
They all died within ten hours of birth.

01:01:43.222 --> 01:01:46.892
In an Inuit community near Anchorage,
a group of 10 children were born.

01:01:47.601 --> 01:01:51.772
There were 20 births in a small village
near the Turkish-lranian border.

01:01:52.606 --> 01:01:54.818
Each location was remote...

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:58.572
...isolated, and each had a blackout
the same as Midwich.

01:01:58.738 --> 01:02:00.949
And how long have you known about this?

01:02:01.032 --> 01:02:03.493
The way I see it,
there are three possibilities.

01:02:03.577 --> 01:02:05.787
Number one. Parthenogenesis.

01:02:05.954 --> 01:02:08.832
The development of a fetus
without fertilization.

01:02:09.166 --> 01:02:10.959
I know. I don't buy that, either.

01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:15.965
Two. We do know the CIA slipped doses
of LSD to men without them knowing it...

01:02:16.257 --> 01:02:19.635
...in order to study the effects
of psychotropes on gene structure.

01:02:19.719 --> 01:02:22.096
Maybe the government
engineered the blackout...

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:25.224
...then artificially inseminated
your women with super sperm.

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:28.144
First they knocked them out,
then they knocked them up.

01:02:30.771 --> 01:02:33.233
And whas the third possibility?

01:02:33.567 --> 01:02:36.445
Xenogenesis. Implantation.

01:02:36.778 --> 01:02:39.615
The production of an offspring
unlike that of the parent.

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:42.951
Or should I say host?

01:03:22.243 --> 01:03:24.537
Come back to the project.

01:03:25.913 --> 01:03:29.543
Not just a matter of protecting
your daughter. As you can see, it goes...

01:03:29.626 --> 01:03:31.378
...far, far beyond that.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.634
You have to put this
in the back of your mind.

01:03:37.717 --> 01:03:39.553
Don't think about it when near them.

01:03:39.636 --> 01:03:42.889
- Don't ever let them know that you know.
- Why didn't you tell us?

01:03:42.973 --> 01:03:45.976
- I mean, why didn't you warn us?
- Because I couldn't.

01:03:46.768 --> 01:03:48.312
Well, I couldn't.

01:03:48.604 --> 01:03:51.148
If anybody else knew,
the children would know.

01:03:51.399 --> 01:03:54.819
Look, I have spent years of my life
building a wall around this.

01:03:54.902 --> 01:03:57.989
Hiding it, so they couldn't read
what was in my mind.

01:03:58.281 --> 01:04:01.909
But as their powers grow stronger,
they keep looking deeper and deeper.

01:04:02.285 --> 01:04:04.996
I need your help. Would you please just...

01:04:05.788 --> 01:04:07.875
...come back to the project.

01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:01.388
We've made our decision.

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:04.559
Discussion will not change our plans.

01:05:07.938 --> 01:05:11.107
We will live in the abandoned barn
outside of town.

01:05:11.942 --> 01:05:14.027
You will bring us supplies.

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:17.113
You can't stop us, you know.

01:05:17.656 --> 01:05:19.282
Don't try.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.085
You've been discussing us with Dr. Vurner.

01:05:30.086 --> 01:05:32.213
What did she tell you?

01:05:36.717 --> 01:05:38.553
You are hiding something.

01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:38.199
I'm not letting you go.

01:06:41.703 --> 01:06:44.664
- You haven't been given an option.
- Have you?

01:06:49.669 --> 01:06:52.923
You know, you don't always have to do
everything they tell you.

01:06:54.591 --> 01:06:56.343
We are the same.

01:06:57.469 --> 01:06:59.013
You're not.

01:06:59.096 --> 01:07:01.390
You're David. You're different.

01:07:34.508 --> 01:07:37.095
I've come to get Julie. Have you seen her?

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:42.642
Is she at the barn?

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:46.271
Fine.

01:08:10.212 --> 01:08:11.964
Are you all right?

01:08:12.548 --> 01:08:13.674
I'm sorry.

01:08:14.175 --> 01:08:15.886
You're okay, aren't you?

01:08:16.219 --> 01:08:18.805
Julie doesn't want to come with you.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:22.225
Damn it, I don't care what Julie wants.
Her mother's frantic.

01:08:22.559 --> 01:08:24.435
I'm bringing her home.

01:09:28.752 --> 01:09:32.006
Some kind of big accident, Doc,
out by the barn.

01:09:33.716 --> 01:09:35.594
Alan, wait!

01:09:36.511 --> 01:09:40.224
I was just told that the other towns
with blackout children were destroyed.

01:09:40.307 --> 01:09:44.144
- What? All of them?
- Everyone in them, the adults and children.

01:09:44.228 --> 01:09:47.022
They couldn't evacuate
without the children knowing.

01:09:47.106 --> 01:09:50.318
- The governments gave no warning.
- God. What about Midwich?

01:09:50.402 --> 01:09:52.654
I've been told to pack and get out.

01:09:52.737 --> 01:09:56.408
I'm leaving tonight. Do the same.
Get out while you can.

01:10:07.544 --> 01:10:09.630
Another man is dead.

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.013
Why do you hate us so much, Mara?

01:10:17.221 --> 01:10:21.392
It isn't a matter of hate.
It is a biological obligation.

01:10:22.977 --> 01:10:25.563
You are thinking
of what happened to the others.

01:10:25.813 --> 01:10:28.233
Then our actions shouldn't surprise you.

01:10:28.317 --> 01:10:31.236
We have to survive
no matter what the cost.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.071
We are the only ones left now.

01:10:33.155 --> 01:10:35.574
I don't see why
we can't reach an understanding.

01:10:35.657 --> 01:10:37.409
Why can't we just live together?

01:10:37.534 --> 01:10:40.162
If we coexist, we shall dominate you.

01:10:40.287 --> 01:10:42.039
That is inevitable.

01:10:42.122 --> 01:10:44.541
Eventually you will try to eliminate us.

01:10:44.625 --> 01:10:47.086
We are all creatures of the life-force.

01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:50.632
Now it has set us at one another
to see who will survive.

01:10:51.758 --> 01:10:54.969
- Thas a cruel sport.
- Life is cruelty.

01:10:55.053 --> 01:10:59.557
We all feed on each other,
exploit each other in some way to survive.

01:11:01.392 --> 01:11:02.894
I don't agree with you.

01:11:03.061 --> 01:11:05.940
I think that adaptation
is the key to survival.

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:09.443
Cooperation and symbiosis...

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:11.278
...and compassion.

01:11:12.363 --> 01:11:16.116
Why do you think your own survival
depends upon emotion from us?

01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:17.993
Should we pity you?

01:11:18.202 --> 01:11:21.747
- Empathize with your plight?
- You should feel!

01:11:22.039 --> 01:11:24.083
You should feel something!

01:11:25.502 --> 01:11:27.796
Without feelings, you're nothing.

01:11:28.088 --> 01:11:30.924
You're just second-rate mimics
of a higher organism.

01:11:31.633 --> 01:11:35.845
Thas right, a higher organism. We're
your superiors in our capacity to love.

01:11:36.012 --> 01:11:38.807
Without compassion,
you're a doomed species.

01:11:39.057 --> 01:11:42.561
Emotion is irrelevant. It is not our nature.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.612
I'm not so sure you're right about that.

01:11:51.696 --> 01:11:54.323
Still, you are aware of the other colonies.

01:11:54.448 --> 01:11:57.660
So you must be, in some basic sense...

01:11:57.827 --> 01:11:59.370
...aware of who...

01:11:59.745 --> 01:12:01.706
...what we are.

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:04.918
Yes.

01:12:05.377 --> 01:12:07.629
So the question becomes...

01:12:07.713 --> 01:12:10.007
...should you be allowed to live?

01:12:17.055 --> 01:12:19.057
You're suddenly thinking of an ocean.

01:12:24.147 --> 01:12:27.567
You're blocking your thoughts
rather effectively with this image.

01:12:30.695 --> 01:12:34.032
We must leave here, spread out, disperse.

01:12:34.115 --> 01:12:38.244
Soon we will have reached
a stage where we can form new colonies.

01:12:38.369 --> 01:12:41.332
You will arrange a method
of getting us away from here.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.335
What if I refuse you?

01:12:44.668 --> 01:12:46.879
You are a prisoner of your values...

01:12:46.962 --> 01:12:49.882
...and you won't be able to deceive us.

01:12:51.091 --> 01:12:52.509
You know that.

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:54.553
Don't you?

01:12:56.096 --> 01:12:57.598
Father?

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:01.853
Yes.

01:13:02.604 --> 01:13:04.231
Yes, I know that.

01:13:04.356 --> 01:13:05.982
Make your arrangements.

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:08.610
We must leave tonight.

01:13:35.263 --> 01:13:37.765
You're thinking of the one who died.

01:13:38.767 --> 01:13:40.852
She was to be my partner.

01:13:43.021 --> 01:13:45.107
Yes, is true.

01:13:45.857 --> 01:13:48.777
Without a mate,
you are of less importance to us.

01:13:49.361 --> 01:13:52.739
And your development
of emotions is disturbing.

01:13:55.826 --> 01:13:58.580
We can't leave you behind.

01:13:59.455 --> 01:14:01.958
It is time we resolved this.

01:14:42.584 --> 01:14:44.294
Hurry up!

01:14:44.711 --> 01:14:48.673
"Begone, everyone who is proud,
and bring him low...

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.551
"...and tread down the wicked
where they stand!"

01:14:51.718 --> 01:14:54.388
- This is the last of it.
- All right, get going.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.558
"Bind their faces in the world below.

01:14:57.725 --> 01:15:00.144
"Then will I also acknowledge to you...

01:15:00.228 --> 01:15:04.398
"...that your own right hand
can give you victory!"

01:15:18.163 --> 01:15:20.082
I'm glad you're here.

01:15:20.666 --> 01:15:23.794
I wanted to talk to you.
I really think that I can help you.

01:15:48.319 --> 01:15:50.989
You've got to stop! Please stop!

01:15:51.072 --> 01:15:53.367
You got to stop! Sarah, please!

01:16:25.609 --> 01:16:27.903
"Hast thou eyes of flesh?

01:16:28.904 --> 01:16:31.824
"Dost thou see as man sees?"

01:19:07.071 --> 01:19:09.782
A state of emergency has been declared.

01:19:09.865 --> 01:19:11.909
Please return to your homes...

01:19:11.992 --> 01:19:15.287
...and remain there until further notice.

01:19:20.627 --> 01:19:23.838
- Come here! Grab my hand, quick!
- Come on!

01:19:25.966 --> 01:19:29.052
People will be arrested.

01:19:31.846 --> 01:19:34.349
This is a state of emergency.

01:20:10.679 --> 01:20:11.680
Please be home.

01:20:17.269 --> 01:20:19.147
The children murdered Sarah.

01:20:19.272 --> 01:20:22.775
Susan too. I just found her at the clinic.

01:20:22.859 --> 01:20:24.944
The police are on their way to the barn.

01:20:25.069 --> 01:20:28.072
They're going after the children.
We've got to stop them.

01:20:28.448 --> 01:20:31.159
- You can't go. You'll get hurt.
- We've got to try!

01:20:31.242 --> 01:20:35.371
No. The state police can't do anything
to stop the children. Ill be a bloodbath.

01:20:36.247 --> 01:20:38.542
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:40.461
There's another way.

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:42.671
Now, look, something happened today.

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:45.591
I was able to block Mara
from reading my thoughts.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:48.844
- How?
- I suddenly thought of the ocean.

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:52.014
I suddenly saw the view
in front of our house.

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:55.392
You know how Barbara and I
used to dream our dreams there?

01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:57.479
We used to stand on the cliff and...

01:20:57.562 --> 01:21:01.524
...right in front of us was something
so much more powerful than we'll ever be.

01:21:01.608 --> 01:21:05.737
That image came to me. That image came
to me, and they couldn't see past it.

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:08.740
I know I can do that again.
I can build a wall.

01:21:09.282 --> 01:21:11.868
I can build a wall and deceive them.

01:21:18.668 --> 01:21:20.586
What are you going to do?

01:21:22.713 --> 01:21:25.091
The only thing that we can do.

01:21:32.765 --> 01:21:33.934
No.

01:21:34.685 --> 01:21:36.228
Not David!

01:21:36.603 --> 01:21:39.898
He's not one of them! No!

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.566
Multiple suspects. Possible 417.

01:22:20.649 --> 01:22:23.611
All units respond and echo your 10-4.

01:22:24.236 --> 01:22:25.654
41-A.

01:22:27.197 --> 01:22:29.116
41-A, do you copy?

01:22:30.826 --> 01:22:32.746
Echo, 41-A. Do you copy?

01:22:33.121 --> 01:22:35.123
We're in position. Send them in.

01:22:35.373 --> 01:22:38.585
Roger, this is 2-A. I copy.
241 in progress. Stand by.

01:22:57.146 --> 01:22:58.856
What are you waiting for?

01:22:58.981 --> 01:23:00.816
You got your orders.

01:23:35.061 --> 01:23:35.937
Get out!

01:26:31.204 --> 01:26:34.041
- More death.
- Survival.

01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:45.428
Tell us what arrangements
you have made for us.

01:26:46.137 --> 01:26:48.139
Well, I haven't had much time.

01:26:50.808 --> 01:26:52.936
It is 11:22.

01:26:53.519 --> 01:26:55.897
What are you anxious about?

01:26:57.691 --> 01:26:59.610
The arrangements.

01:27:00.486 --> 01:27:02.529
Yes. Actually, I...

01:27:02.905 --> 01:27:04.823
I left my notebook out in the car.

01:27:05.115 --> 01:27:07.201
I wonder if somebody could go out and...

01:27:07.284 --> 01:27:10.496
...get my notebook
from the front seat of my car.

01:27:14.166 --> 01:27:15.251
No.

01:27:26.471 --> 01:27:28.765
I am unable to see what you're thinking.

01:27:29.683 --> 01:27:31.309
Well, I'm...

01:27:31.434 --> 01:27:35.021
...just wondering who's going to go out
and get the notebook from my car.

01:27:35.272 --> 01:27:36.857
- David.
- No.

01:27:58.213 --> 01:28:00.841
You are successfully
blocking your thoughts.

01:28:29.579 --> 01:28:30.872
You are thinking...

01:28:31.956 --> 01:28:33.584
...of a brick wall.

01:28:41.717 --> 01:28:43.802
Why do you keep looking at the clock?

01:28:57.150 --> 01:28:58.401
Come on.

01:28:59.069 --> 01:29:01.363
- We're going now.
- Mother, no.

01:29:15.044 --> 01:29:16.712
Take your place.

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:04.512
Stop it! Leave her alone!

01:30:05.221 --> 01:30:06.514
Take him!

01:30:06.723 --> 01:30:08.475
Go now! Go!

01:32:03.471 --> 01:32:04.889
Don't worry.

01:32:06.516 --> 01:32:09.728
We'll go someplace where
nobody knows who we are.
