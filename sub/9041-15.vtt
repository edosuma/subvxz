WEBVTT

00:03.167 --> 00:04.833
- SO, GIRLS,
YOU'RE OUT THERE.

00:04.833 --> 00:06.633
YOU'RE SELLING COOKIES.

00:06.633 --> 00:08.467
SOMEONE APPROACHES YOU.

00:08.467 --> 00:09.733
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:11.333 --> 00:13.367
- "WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BUY SOME COOKIES?"

00:13.367 --> 00:14.733
- NO.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.133
AGAIN, WE SAY,

00:22.133 --> 00:26.300
"HOW MANY COOKIES
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY?"

00:26.300 --> 00:28.100
SEE, A FRONTIER GIRL
NEVER GIVES 'EM

00:28.100 --> 00:30.133
THE CHANCE TO SAY NO.

00:30.133 --> 00:31.400
YOU MUST ALWAYS
REMEMBER--

00:31.400 --> 00:33.100
- IF YOUR MOTHER
TELLS ME NOT TO BUY IT,

00:33.100 --> 00:34.567
THEN I CAN'T BUY IT.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.433
HI.
SORRY. SORRY. SORRY.

00:37.433 --> 00:41.500
MY WIFE HAD TO TAKE THE TWINS
TO THE DOCTOR, YEAH.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.967
I TOLD HER,
"JUST BRING ONE OF EM,

00:42.967 --> 00:47.733
AND WE'LL DOUBLE
THE MEDICINE."

00:47.733 --> 00:49.500
YEAH.

00:49.500 --> 00:53.233
- HAVE A SEAT.
- I'LL HAVE A SEAT.

00:53.233 --> 00:55.900
EXCUSE ME.
I'LL SIT OVER THERE.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.100
SORRY. EXCUSE ME.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.600
- OW!
- OH, GOD! I'M SORRY.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.333
I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:00.333 --> 01:01.633
OH, BOY.
REALLY SORRY.

01:01.633 --> 01:04.400
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY, REALLY SORRY.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.000
OH, EXCUSE ME. SORRY.
ALL RIGHT.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I'M SORRY.
AY-YI-YI.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I STEPPED ON A CHILD.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.333
- OH, GOODNESS.

01:20.333 --> 01:21.333
- SORRY.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.167
I'M SORRY, REAL SORRY.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.433
- ALL RIGHT, WHERE WAS I?

01:43.433 --> 01:45.567
OKAY, I WAS
ABOUT TO REMIND YOU

01:45.567 --> 01:48.600
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
RULE OF SALES.

01:48.600 --> 01:53.867
IT'S "ABC":
"ALWAYS BE CLOSING."

01:53.867 --> 01:55.100
GIRLS?

01:55.100 --> 01:58.667
all: [weakly]
"ALWAYS BE CLOSING."

02:04.100 --> 02:07.100
- DO YOU WANT
TO SELL COOKIES?

02:07.100 --> 02:08.233
AGAIN.

02:08.233 --> 02:11.767
all:
ALWAYS BE CLOSING!

02:11.767 --> 02:12.967
VERY GOOD.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.100
OKAY.

02:14.100 --> 02:17.333
NOW,
THIS YEAR'S PRIZES.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.400
TOP SELLER ON THE BOARD

02:19.400 --> 02:23.567
GETS THIS BEAUTIFUL
BEACH CHAIR AND UMBRELLA SET.

02:23.567 --> 02:26.000
all: OOH.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.567
- SECOND PRIZE
IS A UNIFORM PATCH.

02:29.567 --> 02:30.800
all: OH.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.000
- AND THE THIRD PRIZE--

02:33.000 --> 02:36.167
- YOU'RE OUT OF THE TROOP.

02:38.833 --> 02:41.900
I WAS ONLY--I'M KIDDING.
IT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S NOT TRUE.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.767
I WAS JUST JOKING.

02:44.767 --> 02:45.933
I'M SORRY.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.600
- THE THIRD PRIZE

02:47.600 --> 02:50.467
IS THIS SHEET
OF WILDLIFE STICKERS.

02:50.467 --> 02:52.000
- OH!

02:56.767 --> 02:58.133
THAT'S--
NO, I LIKE THAT.

02:58.133 --> 02:59.367
THAT'S GOT MONKEYS
ON IT, RIGHT?

02:59.367 --> 03:01.733
YEAH. I LIKE MONKEYS.

03:03.867 --> 03:05.100
- OKAY, GIRLS,

03:05.100 --> 03:06.633
IT'S TIME TO GO
WITH MRS. MANNING.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.667
SHE'S GOING TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO MAKE A PINHOLE CAMERA

03:08.667 --> 03:10.333
OUT OF AN ORANGE JUICE
CONTAINER.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.333
EVERYBODY BROUGHT
THEIR ORANGE JUICE CONTAINERS?

03:18.033 --> 03:19.233
- YOU KNOW WHAT, ALLY?

03:19.233 --> 03:22.000
I GOT A REAL CAMERA
IN THE CAR.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.100
GREAT PICTURES,
NO PULP.

03:35.533 --> 03:37.867
- AND, MOMS, IN ADDITION
TO YOUR DOOR-TO-DOOR SALES,

03:37.867 --> 03:40.867
I'LL BE ASSIGNING LOCATIONS
FOR YOUR COOKIE-SELLING BOOTHS.

03:40.867 --> 03:43.667
THERE'S COFFEE AND SNACKS HERE
IF YOU WANT THEM.

03:46.367 --> 03:48.667
- BOY, SHE TAKES THIS STUFF
SERIOUSLY, HUH?

03:48.667 --> 03:50.333
- PEGGY?
OH, YEAH.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.633
AND YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT GETTING THAT BEACH CHAIR--

03:52.633 --> 03:55.200
SHE'S A KILLER.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:56.500 --> 03:58.200
I THOUGHT THE GIRLS
SELL THE COOKIES.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.667
- YEAH, RIGHT.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.767
- HELLO, ALLY'S DAD.
I'M MOLLY'S MOM.

04:02.767 --> 04:04.633
- HI. HI, I'M RAY.

04:04.633 --> 04:06.467
- I'M GIVING YOU
LICKETY-SPLIT CLEANERS.

04:06.467 --> 04:08.200
THAT'S WHERE DEBRA AND ALLY
CAN SET UP ON THE SIDEWALK

04:08.200 --> 04:09.533
AND SELL COOKIES.

04:09.533 --> 04:11.333
- OKAY, WELL,
AND IT MIGHT NOT BE DEBRA.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.767
I MEAN, I COULD BE
OUT THERE WITH ALLY.

04:12.767 --> 04:17.167
I'M ONE OF THOSE
VERY INVOLVED DADS.

04:17.167 --> 04:19.233
- GOOD FOR YOU.

04:19.233 --> 04:20.700
HERE YOU GO.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.933
- OH, LISTEN, SORRY
ABOUT THE JOKE BEFORE, YOU KNOW?

04:22.933 --> 04:24.233
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

04:24.233 --> 04:25.300
- [dryly]
OH, NO, I ENJOYED IT IMMENSELY.

04:25.300 --> 04:26.433
IT WAS VERY, VERY FUNNY.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.433
- DAMN! I GOT PEETIE'S.

04:34.433 --> 04:37.167
- WHAT--THE MUFFLER PLACE?
PEETIE'S?

04:37.167 --> 04:38.567
- PEETIE'S.

04:38.567 --> 04:40.500
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
WITH THIS DEADBEAT SPOT.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.800
NO FOOT TRAFFIC.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.700
SHE GIVES HERSELF
MARCO'S PIZZA EVERY YEAR.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.333
THAT'S WHY SHE WINS.

04:46.333 --> 04:50.133
- MAN, THAT'S TOTALLY BOGUS.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.467
- PEETIE'S.

04:52.467 --> 04:53.433
- EXCUSE ME.

04:53.433 --> 04:55.167
- UH, PEGGY,
AH, I'M SORRY,

04:55.167 --> 04:57.933
BUT PEETIE'S IS KIND OF
OUT OF THE WAY FOR ME.

04:57.933 --> 05:00.867
- OH. OKAY.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:00.867 --> 05:02.167
I'M SURE THAT ALLY'S DAD

05:02.167 --> 05:03.300
WOULDN'T MIND
SWITCHING WITH YOU.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.000
- WHA--HUH? ME?
PEETIE'S?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.367
- YEAH, SWITCH YOUR CARD
WITH SARAH.

05:07.367 --> 05:09.167
YOU DON'T MIND,
DO YOU?

05:09.167 --> 05:12.200
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
PEETIE'S, WE'RE--

05:12.200 --> 05:15.067
- WHAT WAS THAT?

05:15.067 --> 05:18.933
- NOTHING.

05:18.933 --> 05:20.567
- THANKS, ALLY'S DAD.

05:23.067 --> 05:24.367
- HEY, GOOD LUCK.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.533
MAYBE YOU'LL GET
THOSE MONKEY STICKERS.

05:31.933 --> 05:33.200
- HI, MOMMY.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.533
- HEY, HONEY.
HOW WAS YOUR MEETING?

05:34.533 --> 05:35.967
- COULD YOU COME
NEXT TIME?

05:35.967 --> 05:37.800
- SURE.

05:37.800 --> 05:41.800
- HEY, DON'T EVER DO THAT
TO ME AGAIN, OKAY?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.067
- WHAT?

05:43.067 --> 05:44.367
- SEND ME
TO ONE OF THOSE MEETINGS.

05:44.367 --> 05:48.467
I WAS THE ONLY GUY
IN THAT HENHOUSE.

05:48.467 --> 05:51.200
REALLY, REALLY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.200
- WHAT, SPEND TIME
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

05:53.200 --> 05:57.567
- OH, DON'T PUT YOUR TWIST
ON IT, OKAY?

05:57.567 --> 06:00.067
AND WHAT'S
WITH THAT TROOP LEADER?

06:00.067 --> 06:02.300
- PEGGY?
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.933
- OH, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
YOU'RE BEST FRIENDS.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.333
- I HARDLY KNOW HER,

06:07.333 --> 06:09.800
BUT I APPRECIATE
ALL THE ORGANIZATION SHE DOES.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.167
SHE'S A GREAT TROOP LEADER.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.300
- YEAH, SO WAS HITLER.

06:19.367 --> 06:21.567
SIMILAR UNIFORM TOO.

06:24.600 --> 06:25.700
LOOK AT THIS. HUH?

06:25.700 --> 06:27.367
PEETIE'S.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

06:27.367 --> 06:29.800
THAT'S THE WORST COOKIE SPOT!

06:29.800 --> 06:32.200
PEETIE'S!

06:32.200 --> 06:33.533
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

06:33.533 --> 06:38.000
- EVERYBODY KNOWS!
COME ON.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.700
I HAD LICKETY-SPLIT,

06:39.700 --> 06:42.333
BUT SHE FORCED ME TO TRADE IT
FOR PEETIE'S MUFFLER PLACE,

06:42.333 --> 06:46.600
AND THEN SHE GETS MARCO'S,
THE BEST SPOT!

06:46.600 --> 06:48.567
- HOW DID SHE FORCE YOU?

06:48.567 --> 06:49.467
- HOW?

06:49.467 --> 06:51.133
SHE RIPPED IT
OUT OF MY HAND.

06:51.133 --> 06:54.400
I'M LUCKY I HAVE A HAND STILL!

06:54.400 --> 06:56.600
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.667
THIS LADY DOESN'T KNOW
WHO SHE'S DEALING WITH, OKAY?

06:58.667 --> 07:00.600
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS COOKIE
SIGN-UP SHEET TO WORK.

07:00.600 --> 07:04.133
I'LL HANG IT UP
AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.600
YEAH.
[laughs]

07:05.600 --> 07:08.467
LITTLE MISS PEGGY
WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT HER.

07:08.467 --> 07:11.567
I'LL BE BRINGING HOME
THAT SWEET, SWEET BEACH CHAIR.

07:15.933 --> 07:17.567
- RAY, ALLY SHOULD SELL
HER OWN COOKIES.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.400
THAT'S HOW WE'VE ALWAYS
DONE IT IN THE PAST.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.100
- YEAH, AND THAT'S WHY
EVERY TIME WE GO TO THE BEACH,

07:21.100 --> 07:24.500
WE GOT TO SIT
IN THE FREAKING SAND, OKAY?

07:24.500 --> 07:27.633
NO, UH-UH.

07:27.633 --> 07:30.533
NO MORE.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.633
NO MORE, BABY.

07:31.633 --> 07:36.200
LET PEGGY CLEAN THE SAND
OUT OF HER BEHIND!

07:37.700 --> 07:39.567
- GIVE ME THE SHEET.

07:39.567 --> 07:42.033
- NO, NO, THIS IS
FOR MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.

07:42.033 --> 07:43.900
- GIVE ME THE SHEET.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.833
- COME ON!

07:45.833 --> 07:47.633
- RAY.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.533
- [hissing]

07:50.533 --> 07:52.800
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.100
DON'T COME CRYING TO ME

07:54.100 --> 07:55.267
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE
THIS SUMMER

07:55.267 --> 07:56.767
IN THE HOT SAND,
GOING LIKE THIS...

08:06.233 --> 08:07.567
- HOW ABOUT THIS, HUH?

08:07.567 --> 08:10.033
SITTING AROUND,
HAVING COOKIES AND MILK.

08:10.033 --> 08:12.200
THIS IS NICE.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.767
- HEY.
- WAS NICE.

08:16.767 --> 08:18.000
- HELLO, RAYMOND.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.633
OH, I'M SO HAPPY
YOU'RE HERE.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.433
- YOU HUNGRY?
- NO, NOT REALLY.

08:22.433 --> 08:23.867
- YOU'LL HAVE SOME COOKIES
AND MILK.

08:23.867 --> 08:25.500
HERE.

08:25.500 --> 08:26.767
- HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT ANY.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.500
- HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WANTS.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.300
- WELL, HE'S NOT
GETTING ANY OF THESE.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.167
- YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE BUYING THESE COOKIES.

08:56.167 --> 08:59.000
DEBRA WOULDN'T LET ME TAKE
ALLY'S SIGN-UP SHEET TO WORK.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.700
WE COULD HAVE BEEN THE COOKIE
CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.900
- WE DIDN'T BUY THESE
FROM ALLY.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.933
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:07.933 --> 09:09.133
- WELL, A LADY
AND HER DAUGHTER

09:09.133 --> 09:10.933
JUST CAME TO OUR DOOR.

09:10.933 --> 09:12.300
- WHAT LADY?

09:12.300 --> 09:14.600
- I DON'T KNOW.
A VERY NICE LADY.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.100
I THINK HER NAME WAS,
UH...PEGGY.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.633
- PEGGY!

09:28.467 --> 09:31.767
- [imitating Marie]
"LET RAYMOND HAVE SOME COOKIES."

09:40.100 --> 09:41.333
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

09:41.333 --> 09:42.900
HOW COULD YOU
BUY COOKIES FROM PEGGY?

09:42.900 --> 09:44.633
- WE WERE HUNGRY.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.900
- DON'T YOU KNOW
THAT ALLY IS SELLING

09:46.900 --> 09:48.600
THE VERY SAME COOKIES?

09:50.067 --> 09:51.267
- I LIKED THAT PEG
AND HER LITTLE GIRL.

09:51.267 --> 09:52.667
CUTE AS A BUTTON.

09:52.667 --> 09:56.100
DIDN'T SAY A WORD,
BUT SIMPLY PRECIOUS.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.333
- SHE WAS DARLING.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.867
- MORE DARLING
THAN YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER?

09:58.867 --> 10:01.633
- OF COURSE NOT!
WE LOVE ALLY.

10:01.633 --> 10:02.900
ALLY IS DELIGHTFUL.

10:02.900 --> 10:05.200
YOU ARE GONNA DO SOMETHING
ABOUT HER TEETH, THOUGH,

10:05.200 --> 10:06.200
AREN'T YOU?

10:06.200 --> 10:08.067
- HER TEETH?

10:08.067 --> 10:09.367
- WE'VE ALWAYS FELT BAD

10:09.367 --> 10:10.967
THAT WE DIDN'T
HAVE YOURS FIXED.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.333
- MAYBE YOU DID.

10:12.333 --> 10:15.533
I USED THE 400 BUCKS
TO BUY A BELT SANDER.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.600
- WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT--
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY TEETH?

10:17.600 --> 10:19.200
- HAVE YOU EVER
LOOKED IN YOUR MOUTH?

10:19.200 --> 10:23.200
IT'S LIKE A PRISON RIOT.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.333
- AND THAT LITTLE GIRL'S HAIR,
WITH THOSE LOVELY BRAIDS.

10:27.333 --> 10:30.100
- YEAH, YEAH, LIKE HEIDI
IN THE MOUNTAINS.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.733
- ALLY HAS NICE HAIR.

10:31.733 --> 10:34.367
- ALLY'S HAIR.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.233
- WHAT?

10:35.233 --> 10:36.767
- SHE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL HAIR,

10:36.767 --> 10:39.433
BUT SOMEONE
HAS TO GROOM IT PROPERLY.

10:39.433 --> 10:42.500
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I OFFERED
TO TAKE HER TO MY BEAUTY SALON?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.667
- SO SHE CAN HAVE
THIS LOOK?

10:52.700 --> 10:55.367
- BETTER THIS LOOK THAN...

10:55.367 --> 10:57.300
- LOOK, ALLY'S HAIR IS FINE!

10:57.300 --> 10:58.933
EVEN IF SHE LOOKED
LIKE AN IGUANA,

10:58.933 --> 11:01.800
YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT COOKIES
FROM HER INSTEAD OF A STRANGER,

11:01.800 --> 11:06.033
A STRANGER WHO HAPPENS
TO BE MY ARCHENEMY!

11:06.033 --> 11:09.133
- OH...
YOU HAVE AN ARCHENEMY.

11:09.133 --> 11:11.567
WHAT ARE YOU,
A SUPERHERO NOW?

11:16.767 --> 11:20.633
- CAPTAIN BIG NOSE.

11:24.567 --> 11:27.367
- "I'M GONNA BLOW YOU AWAY!"

11:34.300 --> 11:36.000
- HEY, RAY, YOU GOT TO--

11:36.000 --> 11:37.500
- AH, AH, AH, AH--
LOOK AT THIS.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.567
LOOK AT THIS. YOU SEE THIS?
YOU HAPPY NOW?

11:39.567 --> 11:41.167
- OH, WHERE'D THESE
COME FROM?

11:41.167 --> 11:43.833
- NOT FROM US!

11:43.833 --> 11:45.033
- DON'T WORRY, RAYMOND.

11:45.033 --> 11:46.967
WE'LL BUY A BOX
FROM ALLY TOO.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.867
- A BOX? ONE BOX?

11:48.867 --> 11:50.433
- NO! NO MORE COOKIES!

11:50.433 --> 11:52.800
WE'RE NOT
THE ROCKEFELLERS!

11:52.800 --> 11:54.433
- ONE BOX FOR ME.

11:54.433 --> 11:56.567
I'LL GET THE APPLE CINNAMON,
BECAUSE IT'S LOW-FAT.

11:56.567 --> 11:58.533
- NOT AFTER YOU BUTTER 'EM.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.100
- YOU KNOW
WHO THEY GOT THESE FROM?

12:05.100 --> 12:08.200
YOUR FRIEND PEGGY HITLER.

12:08.200 --> 12:12.767
- YOU HAVE A FRIEND
NAMED HITLER?

12:12.767 --> 12:14.567
- SHE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.833
- BUT HER LAST NAME
IS HITLER?

12:17.833 --> 12:19.200
- SHE'S NOT A HITLER.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.700
- SHE INVADED OUR TERRITORY.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.733
- SEE, NOW I FEEL BAD
FOR ALLY.

12:23.733 --> 12:25.667
WE'LL BUY MORE
THAN ONE BOX FROM HER.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.000
- NO, WE'RE NOT!

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
BRAID HER HAIR,
FIX HER TEETH,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
AND COME BACK NEXT YEAR!

12:39.167 --> 12:41.367
- OKAY, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY, DON'T WORRY.

12:41.367 --> 12:43.000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY
ANY MORE COOKIES.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.900
ALL THE MONEY GOES
TO THE SAME TROOP.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.300
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT!

12:46.300 --> 12:48.533
THIS WOMAN POACHED
OUR OWN FAMILY!

12:48.533 --> 12:51.333
- WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND "THIS WOMAN"?

12:51.333 --> 12:54.000
- [growling]
I DON'T LIKE HER!

12:57.467 --> 13:02.667
- AND, UH,
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE HER?

13:02.667 --> 13:03.700
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.133
SHE'S PUSHY AND ANNOYING
AND--AND--

13:06.133 --> 13:07.900
- AND SHE'S A WOMAN?

13:07.900 --> 13:09.967
- WHAT?
I NEVER SAID THAT.

13:09.967 --> 13:11.467
- OH, COME ON, RAY.

13:11.467 --> 13:13.767
YOU WOULDN'T ACT LIKE THIS
IF A MAN DID THIS.

13:13.767 --> 13:16.467
- A MAN WOULDN'T DO THIS.

13:16.467 --> 13:18.000
- OKAY.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.267
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

13:19.267 --> 13:20.767
YOU DON'T LIKE WOMEN.

13:20.767 --> 13:24.033
- WHO LIKES WOMEN?

13:24.033 --> 13:25.800
- I LIKE WOMEN.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.300
- DON'T LIE, RAYMOND.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.033
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:30.033 --> 13:32.600
- WELL, I ALWAYS FELT
YOU HAD A PROBLEM WITH WOMEN.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.033
- A PROBLEM WITH WOMEN?
LIKE WHO?

13:35.033 --> 13:37.567
- WELL, ME, FOR INSTANCE.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.800
- WHAT?

13:38.800 --> 13:43.133
YOU'RE MY MOTHER.
YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN.

13:43.133 --> 13:46.033
- DR. FREUD ON LINE ONE
FOR YOU, RAYMOND.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.367
- YOU HAD THIS PROBLEM
YOUR WHOLE LIFE,

13:54.367 --> 13:55.767
EVER SINCE
YOU COULD TALK.

13:55.767 --> 13:56.833
- WHAT? WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?

13:56.833 --> 13:58.233
- YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TALK.

13:58.233 --> 14:00.000
- TO YOU.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.100
- EXACTLY.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.400
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WOMEN,

14:02.400 --> 14:04.200
BECAUSE WOMEN NEED
TO TALK THINGS OUT,

14:04.200 --> 14:05.500
AND YOU'VE NEVER
WANTED TO DO THAT.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.567
- SHE'S RIGHT.
- OH, HERE WE GO.

14:07.567 --> 14:09.267
- NO, YOU DON'T WANT A WOMAN
WHO TALKS

14:09.267 --> 14:10.633
OR NEEDS ANYTHING
OR WANTS ANYTHING,

14:10.633 --> 14:12.167
AND THE MOMENT
A WOMAN EXPRESSES HERSELF,

14:12.167 --> 14:13.633
SHE BELONGS
IN THE HENHOUSE.

14:13.633 --> 14:14.733
- AMEN.

14:17.233 --> 14:19.700
- YOU SHOULD HEAR
HOW HE TALKS ABOUT THIS PEGGY.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.833
- CALLS HER HITLER.
- OH, WILL YOU STOP IT?

14:21.833 --> 14:24.767
- I DON'T HAVE TO STOP.
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH WOMEN.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.300
- YOU HAVE NO WOMEN.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.967
- HE'S WORRIED ABOUT PEGGY--
OR ANY WOMAN--

14:29.967 --> 14:31.600
BEATING HIM
OUT OF A BEACH CHAIR.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.867
- NO, NO, NO, LOOK.

14:32.867 --> 14:34.433
IT'S NOT ABOUT
A BEACH CHAIR ANYMORE, OKAY?

14:34.433 --> 14:38.100
THIS WOMAN--
THIS PERSON IS MEAN.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.333
THIS PERSON IS A BULLY

14:39.333 --> 14:43.767
WHO BULLIES PEOPLE
IN A MEAN WAY!

14:46.233 --> 14:48.300
- AND BECAUSE SHE WANTS
THE BEACH CHAIR

14:48.300 --> 14:51.300
AS MUCH AS HE DOES,
HE CALLS HER NAMES.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.600
HE HAS A PROBLEM
WITH WOMEN.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.567
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU GOT THAT WAY.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.200
- I HATE THAT PEGGY.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.533
- JUST WONDERING,
THIS HITLER WOMAN--

15:09.533 --> 15:11.600
SHE'S NOT A SINGLE MOM,
IS SHE?

15:13.933 --> 15:15.467
- UH, WHY ARE WE
SETTING UP HERE?

15:15.467 --> 15:17.367
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
TO PEETIE'S.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.900
- YEAH, WELL, LITTLE CHANGE
OF PLAN, SWEETIE.

15:19.900 --> 15:22.967
THERE WE GO.

15:22.967 --> 15:24.567
IT'S NICE HERE AT MARCO'S,
ISN'T IT?

15:24.567 --> 15:27.267
LET'S FIX YOUR HAIR
A LITTLE.

15:27.267 --> 15:29.967
- OW!
- I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

15:29.967 --> 15:32.200
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY:
"EYE APPEAL IS BUY APPEAL."

15:32.200 --> 15:33.333
OH, CUSTOMERS.
COME ON. COME ON.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.100
STAND UP.
STAND UP STRAIGHT.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.867

WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY?

15:36.867 --> 15:38.600
- HOW ABOUT ZERO?

15:42.300 --> 15:43.800
- YOU COULD BE A LITTLE LOUDER,
YOU KNOW?

15:43.800 --> 15:45.833
JUST A LITTLE MORE FORCEFUL.
LIKE THIS. WATCH.

15:45.833 --> 15:47.933
COOKIES! COOKIES! COOKIES!
- OH, NO, THANK YOU.

15:47.933 --> 15:50.267

16:30.467 --> 16:33.100

16:40.733 --> 16:43.600

WHERE MY PARENTS LIVE.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.333

16:51.567 --> 16:53.233

YOU WALKED IN THE DOOR.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.700
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE PART
OF THE FRONTIER ORGANIZATION,

17:10.700 --> 17:12.567
THERE'S ONE THING
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND.

17:12.567 --> 17:16.133
- WHAT'S THAT?
"ABC": "ALWAYS BE CRANKY"?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.433
- LOOK, I WANT YOU
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

17:22.433 --> 17:25.767
- WHY? THIS IS A GREAT SPOT.
I'M SELLING TONS OF COOKIES.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.200
- IN OUR ORGANIZATION,

17:27.200 --> 17:29.100
THERE ARE SOME RULES
THAT EVERYONE MUST FOLLOW.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.567
- YEAH. YOUR RULES.

17:30.567 --> 17:33.767
- THAT'S RIGHT.
READ THE SASH.

17:33.767 --> 17:35.300
- LISTEN, LADY.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.233
WHEN YOU CAME OUT TO MY STREET
AND SOLD TO MY FAMILY,

17:37.233 --> 17:39.433
YOU CROSSED A LINE.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.433

IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,

17:42.433 --> 17:44.800
SO, YEAH,
I SOLD TO THEM.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.333

18:12.267 --> 18:14.500
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE LOOKS ON THEIR FACES,

18:14.500 --> 18:18.533
ESPECIALLY THE GIANT
AND THE BALD ONE.

18:23.833 --> 18:26.567
- YEAH, WELL, YOU DIDN'T EVEN
SCRATCH THE SURFACE, OKAY?

18:26.567 --> 18:30.767
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THOSE TWO
ARE CAPABLE OF PUTTING AWAY.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.133
- ARE YOU GONNA MOVE?

18:32.133 --> 18:36.267
- I DON'T THINK SO, PEGGY.

18:50.633 --> 18:53.000

20:07.500 --> 20:11.167

20:21.833 --> 20:23.833
NOBODY...

20:23.833 --> 20:28.600
BEATS UP MY HUSBAND.

20:31.467 --> 20:34.400
- SHE DIDN'T BEAT ME UP!

20:34.400 --> 20:37.133
- YOU GOT A PROBLEM,
YOU TAKE IT UP WITH ME.

20:37.133 --> 20:38.933
- I CAN HANDLE THIS, DEB.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.067
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK, PEGGY?

20:41.067 --> 20:42.867
YOU ARE A BULLY.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.467
I DON'T LIKE BULLIES.

20:44.467 --> 20:47.267
YOU COME NEAR MY HUSBAND AGAIN,

20:47.267 --> 20:49.833
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A REAL PROBLEM.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.267

20:55.833 --> 20:57.433
- UH, DADDY TRIPPED.

20:57.433 --> 20:59.600

HELPING HIM UP.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.267

TO SEE YOU AGAIN, PEG.

21:01.267 --> 21:03.600
