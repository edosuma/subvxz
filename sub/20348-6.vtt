WEBVTT

00:02.962 --> 00:04.255
I gave up.

00:05.048 --> 00:08.176
After the four miscarriages, we tried IVF.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.595
40 grand for three eggs.

00:12.097 --> 00:15.058
We joked about
how we were gonna end up with triplets

00:15.225 --> 00:17.602
and whether we should
make their names rhyme.

00:17.894 --> 00:20.772
But none of them stuck.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.068
Not the names, the eggs.

00:27.612 --> 00:29.447
And that was that.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.201
I gave up. No baby for me.

00:36.246 --> 00:41.793
And then five years went by and we finally
stopped bullshitting about adoption,

00:42.961 --> 00:44.504
and then it just...

00:47.465 --> 00:48.842
Happened.

00:51.136 --> 00:52.220
I was pregnant.

00:53.513 --> 00:55.557
And he was...

00:58.101 --> 00:59.144
Perfect.

01:01.354 --> 01:02.689
His name is Sam.

01:05.817 --> 01:07.235
Six months later,

01:08.486 --> 01:12.657
I walk into the laundromat
and I strap him into his car seat.

01:14.743 --> 01:17.537
And he was crying, so I didn't kiss him.

01:18.496 --> 01:21.499
<i>I knew that once the car was moving,
he'd calm down.</i>

01:27.255 --> 01:28.715
And then he was gone.

01:36.514 --> 01:38.892
<i>So, I sit in the parking lot
and wait all day,</i>

01:40.518 --> 01:42.479
because he could come back, right?

01:45.190 --> 01:46.691
They could all come back.

01:47.358 --> 01:51.196
And if they did, it'd be on the exact spot
where they disappeared from.

01:54.491 --> 01:57.619
<i>So, my son, who doesn't even know
how to crawl, I mean...</i>

01:58.870 --> 02:02.123
<i>He didn't. It's been two years.
Maybe he's older now?</i>

02:03.833 --> 02:06.377
<i>But he could just reappear
in a fucking parking lot.</i>

02:06.544 --> 02:10.882
<i>And if I'm not there, if I'm not there
when he comes back, what happens?</i>

02:13.134 --> 02:15.553
<i>Do you think he even remembers me?</i>

02:16.971 --> 02:18.014
<i>I should stop.</i>

02:19.516 --> 02:21.267
<i>That's what my husband said.</i>

02:23.061 --> 02:24.521
<i>I need to give up, right?</i>

02:27.607 --> 02:28.858
<i>Right?</i>

02:31.110 --> 02:32.779
Are you gonna say something?

02:38.451 --> 02:41.996
You know there are two of those bitches
in white standing out front right now,

02:42.163 --> 02:43.540
smoking their fucking cigarettes?

02:43.706 --> 02:45.708
They probably think your patients
are easy pickings.

02:45.875 --> 02:49.587
If I asked them to tell me what to do,
they'd at least write it down for me.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.675
<i>Is that what I should do?</i>

02:57.011 --> 02:59.055
Tell me what to fucking do.

03:09.858 --> 03:11.192
I don't know.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.129
Tell me what to do.

10:09.944 --> 10:11.028
Hey, Pop.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.031
Hey, Lorelei.

10:16.826 --> 10:18.035
What you got there?

10:20.204 --> 10:21.247
Shoes.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.377
That's one hell of a shiner.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.715
You should see the other guy.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.386
I take it your husband told you
we were here.

10:36.679 --> 10:37.888
Which husband?

10:40.891 --> 10:43.644
I heard you were with
the good Reverend Jamison.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.355
He coming, too?

10:47.565 --> 10:48.566
No.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.986
He gave me something for you, though.

11:03.414 --> 11:07.376
He says he's sorry
he didn't put you in his fucking book.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.130
Who torched it?

11:13.132 --> 11:14.258
Your son.

11:16.135 --> 11:17.136
Is he here?

11:18.262 --> 11:19.263
He was.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.601
Right now,
he's off having himself a think.

11:24.435 --> 11:25.686
A think about what?

11:27.730 --> 11:29.398
We asked him to die.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.735
Again.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.331
Whatever is happening here,

11:47.166 --> 11:48.584
I wanna be a part of it.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.528
<i>- What happened?</i>
- Dog bit me.

12:58.654 --> 13:00.531
Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little rabies.

13:05.661 --> 13:07.830
- Is it them?
- You tell me.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.086
Oh!

13:16.297 --> 13:18.048
Dr. Bekker and Dr. Eden.

13:20.176 --> 13:21.760
Yeah, that's them.

13:23.471 --> 13:26.724
- Told you it was the right house.
- They don't look like physicists to me.

13:26.891 --> 13:29.101
What are physicists supposed to look like?

13:29.518 --> 13:32.229
I don't know. Shouldn't they be wearing
lab coats or something?

13:39.403 --> 13:40.488
So now what?

13:42.531 --> 13:44.241
Now? Now we wait.

13:49.747 --> 13:52.541
<i>So, I wake up, and my leg is killing me.</i>

13:52.875 --> 13:55.836
<i>I got a tube in my arm,
another one up my dick,</i>

13:56.003 --> 13:58.088
<i>Christopher Sunday is dead,</i>

13:58.255 --> 14:01.926
<i>and I don't know where I am
or how the fuck I got there.</i>

14:03.511 --> 14:06.931
<i>And by there, I mean here.</i>

14:10.267 --> 14:14.271
<i>So, I am discom-fucking-bobulated.</i>

14:17.775 --> 14:20.277
<i>I'm lost. I'm in fucking agony.</i>

14:22.279 --> 14:25.658
<i>I am in so much pain,
I can't fucking see straight.</i>

14:28.827 --> 14:31.622
So I got my hands
on some of the dog's pain pills.

14:31.789 --> 14:34.875
I popped them and soon realized

14:35.042 --> 14:38.170
they were a bit more powerful
than the human variety.

14:39.380 --> 14:42.049
So, I passed out hard,

14:42.675 --> 14:45.469
and when I wake up, I go outside,

14:46.512 --> 14:50.224
and that is the first time
I lay eyes upon this young lady.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.821
And she was drowning the police officer?

15:04.029 --> 15:05.364
Mm-hmm.

15:05.990 --> 15:07.199
Whose name is Kevin.

15:08.117 --> 15:09.118
Correct.

15:09.535 --> 15:10.995
It was a horrible mistake,

15:11.161 --> 15:13.330
and I will be taking responsibility
for what I've done.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.254
I'm not sure she understands.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.506
<i>I understand.</i>

15:23.966 --> 15:28.804
You want to drown Kevin
so that he can go to this place

15:28.971 --> 15:30.514
where the dead people are.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.726
And while he's there, he's going to learn
a song from one of the dead people

15:33.892 --> 15:35.853
and he's gonna bring that song back to you

15:36.020 --> 15:39.690
so you can sing it and stop the biblical
flood that's gonna happen tomorrow.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.484
That about covers it.

15:44.570 --> 15:45.988
And you've...

15:46.864 --> 15:49.867
You've told all this to Kevin
and he's actually considering it.

15:50.034 --> 15:51.035
Yeah.

15:51.243 --> 15:55.039
He got one of Grace's horses, headed out,
said he'd be back by sundown.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.209
And you think that Evie...

16:02.755 --> 16:04.506
That she's in this place, too?

16:05.257 --> 16:06.592
Why wouldn't she be?

16:12.556 --> 16:14.433
Well, so everybody wants something.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.228
A brain, a heart, courage.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.564
Kevin's in the Emerald City.

16:21.065 --> 16:23.233
He's the one that's gonna give it to you.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.780
All right, Dorothy, let's have it.

16:29.907 --> 16:31.575
Tell us we're lunatics.

16:33.661 --> 16:35.788
Yeah, it sounds crazy, but...

16:38.332 --> 16:40.042
These are crazy times, huh?

16:46.090 --> 16:49.426
So, when Kevin comes back,
you're not gonna jam us up?

16:51.428 --> 16:52.429
No.

16:53.430 --> 16:54.932
I'm not gonna jam you up.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.771
You don't think he's coming back.

17:02.439 --> 17:06.944
Well, it's a lot to put on someone,
asking for all that help.

17:07.986 --> 17:12.116
I mean, if it were me,
I would just keep riding.

17:12.282 --> 17:16.036
Get as far from this as possible.
But Kevin, he'll come back.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.706
He always does.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.152
G'day. Miss Playford?

17:48.986 --> 17:49.987
No, sir.

17:51.363 --> 17:52.865
And who might you be?

17:54.533 --> 17:56.618
<i>My name is Maria Carmen Rodriguez.</i>

17:57.119 --> 17:59.496
<i>Date of birth, 8-30-80.</i>

17:59.997 --> 18:02.833
<i>This is a copy of
this morning's</i> Las Noticias.

18:04.752 --> 18:07.796
<i>This was my choice and mine alone.</i>

18:07.963 --> 18:10.048
<i>I indemnify all others.</i>

18:10.215 --> 18:14.219
<i>I'm of sound mind and body,
and give consent to go...</i>

18:15.888 --> 18:18.182
<i>To go wherever they went.</i>

18:20.726 --> 18:21.852
<i>Amen.</i>

18:25.773 --> 18:28.859
So, the two women in that house,
they recorded this?

18:29.026 --> 18:30.694
One would assume.

18:31.361 --> 18:34.865
And we're also assuming
they're just gonna lead us right to this

18:35.032 --> 18:36.700
device they told you about?

18:37.034 --> 18:40.204
You don't have to stay, Laurie.
You can go help Kevin.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.748
Kevin's still at the airport.

18:42.915 --> 18:45.501
Last I checked,
all the flights were grounded.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.628
Well, Michael and John will call me
if they need me.

18:47.795 --> 18:49.379
I'm happy to keep helping here.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.381
You already helped
by finding me the address.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.551
Oh, come on.
You're not gonna let me see this

18:54.718 --> 18:56.762
suicide machine for myself?

18:56.929 --> 19:00.098
- It's not a suicide machine.
- It's not?

19:00.265 --> 19:02.893
'Cause it sure seems like an incredibly
elegant way to kill yourself.

19:03.894 --> 19:06.730
If I was gonna kill myself,
I'd just go scuba diving.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.902
What?

19:12.069 --> 19:13.904
There are lots of ways to die when
you're scuba diving.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.324
Your oxygen tank can break.

19:18.492 --> 19:20.452
You can get a bubble in your blood
that gives you a stroke.

19:20.619 --> 19:21.912
I know. I'm certified.

19:22.079 --> 19:24.414
And Laurie Murphy was certified.

19:24.581 --> 19:28.293
She'd logged hundreds of hours
underwater, but accidents happen.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.962
What a senseless tragedy.

19:33.757 --> 19:37.886
And then Jill and Tom and John
are standing there at the funeral,

19:38.762 --> 19:40.097
and they're protected.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.892
They'll never know that you twisted
the knob the wrong direction

19:44.059 --> 19:45.435
because you wanted to.

19:45.978 --> 19:48.021
And just like that, you were gone.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.107
Clean, quiet certainty.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.609
Fully explained.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.196
Now, that's fucking elegant.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.783
Can I have a napkin, please?

20:00.200 --> 20:03.745
Or if you're going for inelegant,
you could just do it like Matt here.

20:03.996 --> 20:06.957
Know your cancer's back, tell no one,

20:07.791 --> 20:10.794
get no treatment,
pray for divine fucking intervention.

20:11.003 --> 20:12.796
- That's not fair.
<i>- Yes, it is.</i>

20:14.131 --> 20:15.883
- I deserve that.
- You...

20:16.675 --> 20:17.968
You don't wanna kill yourself.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.137
I know suicidal when I see it.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.764
You know suicidal when you see it?

20:22.931 --> 20:24.725
Is that one of your psychic powers?

20:25.893 --> 20:28.186
- I don't have psychic powers.
- Mm!

20:28.353 --> 20:30.480
Oh, that's right. It's John who's psychic.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.483
Come on. You know how it works.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.820
I don't, actually,
'cause I never got a reading.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.656
Why don't you do me?

20:40.657 --> 20:41.742
What?

20:43.243 --> 20:45.329
If I came to your house
and John took my handprint

20:45.495 --> 20:47.372
and I sat down across from him
at the table

20:47.539 --> 20:50.334
and I told him
that I wanted to talk to my kids,

20:50.500 --> 20:53.170
what would you tell him to say to me
in his little earpiece?

20:54.296 --> 20:56.006
- We don't do departures.
- Uh...

20:56.173 --> 20:58.425
Do our parents. They're dead.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.010
Okay.

21:00.677 --> 21:01.678
Um...

21:02.137 --> 21:03.722
Well, I'd start on the Internet.

21:03.889 --> 21:08.435
Look at social media, pictures,
um, personal details.

21:08.602 --> 21:10.354
Like, your parents, how did they die?

21:10.896 --> 21:12.731
In a fire when we were kids.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.650
I didn't know that.

21:15.192 --> 21:16.735
<i>No, fuck my parents.</i>

21:17.402 --> 21:19.363
I wanna talk to my kids.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.990
I just told you, Nora.
We don't do departures.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.701
You did departures when you and your pals
had life-size replicas

21:24.868 --> 21:27.704
made of my family and then sat them down
at my kitchen table.

21:29.247 --> 21:30.290
Come on.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.001
Let me have it.

21:35.379 --> 21:37.714
I can't, Nora. I'm sorry.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.216
Why not?

21:40.133 --> 21:42.344
Because we tried it and it doesn't work.

21:43.679 --> 21:47.516
We had to stop after the third time
John was attacked.

21:48.892 --> 21:49.893
Yeah.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.396
Look, death is easy.

21:52.562 --> 21:55.649
People just want finality,
an end to their grief.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.068
But with departures, there is no end.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.737
And if we indicated otherwise

22:02.531 --> 22:04.992
by just saying we were able to communicate
with those individuals,

22:05.158 --> 22:08.245
it made their loved ones very, very angry.

22:10.414 --> 22:12.249
Because they didn't want closure.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.754
I want fucking closure.

22:26.638 --> 22:27.681
I know.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.436
That's why we're here.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.990
- He's gonna find that body.
- Well, let's hope he doesn't.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.451
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

22:48.827 --> 22:51.580
Matt gave this to you? Is he okay?

22:51.747 --> 22:54.499
Yeah, he's fine. He's still with Nora.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.294
And where is Nora?

22:58.920 --> 23:00.922
Uh, sorry. I can't disclose that.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.136
You can't disclose it?

23:07.929 --> 23:09.431
Look, when we all found Nora in the hotel,

23:09.598 --> 23:12.184
you said you were going to the airport
to be with Kevin.

23:12.642 --> 23:14.644
And he wasn't there.

23:15.479 --> 23:19.858
So I called him
and he actually answered his phone.

23:20.025 --> 23:23.111
He said he was here
and that we should come.

23:23.278 --> 23:25.906
- So why didn't you tell me?
- Because you don't believe in this.

23:26.073 --> 23:27.949
- Hey, just calm down.
- No.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.495
She just shows up.

23:31.661 --> 23:34.539
She won't even tell us
how she even knew we were here.

23:36.333 --> 23:39.044
You wanna disclose
how you got that black eye?

23:41.296 --> 23:42.881
I got it from Nora.

23:48.053 --> 23:49.262
She hit you?

23:52.557 --> 23:54.184
Thought you were supposed to
be helping her.

23:54.351 --> 23:57.687
- I did help her.
- And now she's helping us, right?

23:59.523 --> 24:02.192
That's right. That's right.

24:09.199 --> 24:10.200
Hey!

24:10.909 --> 24:12.494
You wanna give us a hand?

24:19.709 --> 24:20.752
<i>What are those?</i>

24:21.336 --> 24:22.337
Steroids.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.715
You got any painkillers?

24:26.675 --> 24:29.010
- Headache?
- Nah. My uterus hurts.

24:30.262 --> 24:32.973
Before you got to the hotel, I went to
a clinic and got my IUD taken out.

24:33.140 --> 24:35.851
And they said it might be a little sore.
Told me to take a couple ibuprofen.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.227
Jesus.

24:37.394 --> 24:38.687
So you're trying again.

24:39.271 --> 24:40.272
What?

24:41.231 --> 24:42.816
Nothing. I just thought you would...

24:42.983 --> 24:45.443
Might be done after you gave Lily back
to her mother.

24:45.610 --> 24:46.736
I am done.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.497
Still smoking, huh?

24:57.664 --> 24:58.832
No, I quit.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.751
I haven't had a cigarette
since John and I got together.

25:02.252 --> 25:03.628
You stopped for him?

25:04.796 --> 25:09.217
No. I stopped for myself.
It's an incredibly self-destructive habit.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.428
That's what makes it so cool.

25:18.768 --> 25:19.769
<i>My lighter?</i>

25:21.021 --> 25:22.480
Can I have it back, please?

25:23.190 --> 25:24.482
You said you quit.

25:25.066 --> 25:26.818
- I did.
- Then you don't need it.

25:31.406 --> 25:32.616
Please give it back.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.660
Like I did with Lily?

25:39.372 --> 25:40.373
Give me the lighter, Nora.

25:40.540 --> 25:41.625
Come on, Nora.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.628
- She said she doesn't need it.
- Give it to me!

25:45.295 --> 25:47.547
Hey! Get off! Shit!

25:47.964 --> 25:49.007
Get off!

25:49.466 --> 25:50.508
Shit.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.969
Oh, God. Shit. Are you okay?

25:53.136 --> 25:54.554
- They're leaving.
- What?

25:54.721 --> 25:55.764
They're leaving!

26:01.311 --> 26:02.395
Fuck.

26:13.323 --> 26:14.574
Go down.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.627
What the fuck?

26:28.338 --> 26:29.631
You steal this thing?

26:30.590 --> 26:33.301
Said the man who just assaulted
an officer of the law.

26:34.302 --> 26:36.513
Eh, he'll be fine. I had no choice.

26:37.097 --> 26:39.432
His chief's in a tarp
under the goddamn church.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.101
He was heading right for it.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.061
Where are you gonna take him?

26:44.813 --> 26:47.691
Far enough away from civilization
to give us time.

26:48.441 --> 26:49.943
You're just gonna leave him?

26:50.110 --> 26:52.153
Well, here's the good news.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.282
If this thing with Kevin doesn't work,
who gives a shit?

26:55.824 --> 26:58.952
Officer Koala Fart here is gonna drown
in the flood tomorrow

26:59.119 --> 27:00.453
along with all the rest of us.

27:00.787 --> 27:04.624
But if it does work, sweet Lorelei,

27:05.875 --> 27:08.295
I will be honored to spend
my remaining days

27:08.461 --> 27:11.548
locked away from the world I just saved.

27:14.843 --> 27:17.595
It's getting late.
I should be getting dinner ready.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.764
I'll be back before it's on the table.

27:26.938 --> 27:28.481
Storm's coming.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.348
What you drinking?

28:02.640 --> 28:04.267
Just some coffee.

28:05.602 --> 28:06.936
Want some?

28:14.611 --> 28:15.987
Oh, Jesus, that's good.

28:21.493 --> 28:25.580
Remember when we went to coffee
for the first time, just you and me?

28:28.083 --> 28:29.584
Of course I do.

28:31.127 --> 28:32.545
I was hurting.

28:33.963 --> 28:36.883
You reached across the table,
took my hands, and looked at me,

28:37.050 --> 28:39.969
and I felt like
I could've told you anything.

28:41.012 --> 28:42.889
But what I couldn't tell you...

28:43.807 --> 28:46.267
I thought my daughter
might still be alive.

28:50.939 --> 28:53.483
Erika never doubted it.
She took it in and moved on.

28:53.650 --> 28:56.653
But me, I just...
I just couldn't believe it.

29:00.615 --> 29:01.908
I should've told you.

29:06.037 --> 29:08.623
Well, if you had, I wouldn't have talked
you into helping people

29:08.790 --> 29:10.959
talk to their dead relatives.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.046
I thought I was helping you.

29:15.630 --> 29:17.257
Should've taken the hint
when you shredded the money.

29:17.424 --> 29:20.677
No, I shredded the money
because what we were doing wasn't real.

29:20.844 --> 29:22.220
And this is.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.180
Is it?

29:30.770 --> 29:34.524
Do you want Kevin to ask Evie
why she left her family?

29:35.817 --> 29:36.818
No.

29:37.235 --> 29:39.654
I asked him to give her a message.

29:39.863 --> 29:41.865
I want her to know that she was loved.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.709
That's beautiful, John.

30:04.596 --> 30:07.557
<i>One of Grace's kids
was fostered out of a local tribe.</i>

30:08.766 --> 30:09.893
He loved boats.

30:11.561 --> 30:13.188
When his family found out he died,

30:13.354 --> 30:16.149
some of his cousins came down here
to leave a mark.

30:16.316 --> 30:18.485
Grace told them to strip the church.

30:19.235 --> 30:22.530
Took the wood from the church
to make a tombstone for the little boy.

30:22.697 --> 30:23.865
A memorial.

30:24.574 --> 30:26.075
Then that crazy old man got here

30:26.242 --> 30:29.579
and became convinced
it was a part of his flood story.

30:31.164 --> 30:32.415
I still believe him.

30:33.833 --> 30:37.378
Because if I throw out his story,
that means I got to throw out mine, too.

30:40.715 --> 30:42.425
Go ahead. Tell me I'm crazy.

30:45.345 --> 30:47.388
Tell me we've gone too far.

30:49.766 --> 30:53.978
Tell me, and we can go home right now
and forget all this.

30:57.106 --> 30:59.317
Because I can still shred it.

31:08.660 --> 31:10.620
I think you gotta see it through, John.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.295
You're so close.

31:29.973 --> 31:31.766
You're getting too close!

31:31.933 --> 31:33.059
They're gonna see you!

31:33.226 --> 31:35.645
Calm down. I know what I'm doing.

31:42.986 --> 31:44.195
Is your eye okay?

31:44.904 --> 31:46.239
Yeah, it's fine.

31:48.116 --> 31:49.659
I wasn't trying to hit you.

31:50.159 --> 31:51.494
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

31:52.996 --> 31:55.999
Did you hear about the guy
on the French submarine?

31:56.165 --> 31:57.458
<i>- What?</i>
- The one who fired the nuke.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.210
Apparently, he thought
there was some big egg

31:59.377 --> 32:01.170
in a volcano in the middle of the Pacific,

32:01.337 --> 32:04.173
and he was convinced
that this giant seven-headed sea monster

32:04.340 --> 32:06.509
was gonna hatch on the 14th
and eat us all.

32:06.676 --> 32:08.761
He said he got the idea from Revelations.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.388
That's ridiculous.

32:10.930 --> 32:13.683
Revelations is not supposed to
be taken literally.

32:13.850 --> 32:16.185
The seven-headed monster, it's a metaphor.

32:16.561 --> 32:18.563
Oh... So it's only literal
when it's not ridiculous?

32:18.730 --> 32:20.106
That's right.

32:20.273 --> 32:21.691
You would know.

32:21.858 --> 32:24.527
So, let's say this guy comes
and sits on your couch

32:24.694 --> 32:27.405
and he says, "Hey, Doc, I have access
to nuclear weapons

32:27.572 --> 32:29.782
"and I need to destroy Godzilla."

32:29.949 --> 32:32.660
What do you even say to someone like that?

32:34.037 --> 32:35.496
"Don't miss."

32:39.500 --> 32:40.501
Hello?

32:40.668 --> 32:42.503
<i>Laurie, hey. It's Michael.</i>

32:43.004 --> 32:45.048
Hi. Are you at the airport?

32:45.214 --> 32:47.759
<i>No. We're at...
It's a ranch outside of Melbourne.</i>

32:48.051 --> 32:49.969
You're at a ranch? What...

32:50.136 --> 32:54.307
<i>Kevin wasn't at the airport.
He was at this ranch. He's here right now.</i>

32:54.474 --> 32:55.975
<i>His dad found him.</i>

32:56.142 --> 32:58.436
He's with his dad? Okay.

32:58.603 --> 33:01.022
- Um... What...
<i>- You've got to come now, Laurie.</i>

33:01.189 --> 33:02.398
<i>- 5 Pigeon Run Road.</i>
- Okay.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.150
<i>Outside Makarra.</i>

33:04.317 --> 33:06.444
<i>5 Pigeon Run Road.</i>

33:08.404 --> 33:09.447
Is your dad there?

33:09.614 --> 33:10.823
<i>Just get here as soon as you can.</i>

33:10.990 --> 33:11.991
Are you okay?

33:13.785 --> 33:14.869
Hello?

33:18.790 --> 33:19.957
What happened?

33:20.708 --> 33:22.752
Kevin's at a ranch with his father.

33:24.962 --> 33:27.256
That's good. Tomorrow's a big day.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.008
We should all be with family.

33:31.928 --> 33:35.848
<i>There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus</i>

33:36.391 --> 33:38.184
<i>No, not one</i>

33:39.227 --> 33:41.020
<i>No, not one</i>

33:47.777 --> 33:49.862
<i>No one else could heal</i>

33:50.029 --> 33:51.447
Is this enough carrots?

33:53.658 --> 33:55.201
That's plenty, love.

33:58.371 --> 34:02.625
My husband, he used to do all the cooking.

34:04.252 --> 34:08.131
I spent years trying to get the stew
to taste exactly like his.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.259
I even got it right once.

34:12.677 --> 34:14.011
Then I forgot what I did.

34:15.805 --> 34:17.348
Well, it smells delicious.

34:21.644 --> 34:23.104
Was he a good husband?

34:25.148 --> 34:26.149
Kevin.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.568
He was a great husband.

34:30.361 --> 34:31.529
He saved me.

34:32.864 --> 34:34.365
But you divorced him.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.493
Yeah. Well, I joined a cult.

34:37.660 --> 34:39.537
You know, it was just one of those things
they made you do.

34:40.163 --> 34:41.164
Hmm.

34:48.296 --> 34:50.673
I'm so sorry about your children.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.389
Their shoes were missing.

34:59.724 --> 35:00.975
Sorry?

35:01.142 --> 35:02.643
When they found their bodies,

35:02.810 --> 35:05.688
it was clear that they'd been walking
for quite some time,

35:05.855 --> 35:08.065
but their shoes were missing.

35:09.358 --> 35:13.070
They weren't here at the house,
they weren't with the kids.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.491
I've covered the ground
in between a hundred times.

35:16.657 --> 35:20.828
Looked through every pair donated
to charity inside 100 kilometers.

35:23.581 --> 35:25.208
When Kevin talks to them,

35:26.459 --> 35:28.920
he's gonna ask them
where they put their shoes.

35:32.215 --> 35:34.050
I need to go set the table.

35:34.217 --> 35:36.093
Mind giving it a stir?

35:37.762 --> 35:38.805
Sure.

35:59.951 --> 36:02.203
Not much of a last supper.

36:02.370 --> 36:04.705
Well, you certainly
cleaned your plate for not liking it.

36:04.872 --> 36:06.916
No, the food is scrumptious.

36:07.083 --> 36:10.545
I'm just saying, not much of a last supper
without our Jesus.

36:15.383 --> 36:18.177
I think I'm gonna go to lie down
for a bit.

36:20.179 --> 36:22.306
Wake me when he comes back.

36:24.767 --> 36:29.689
Truth is,
along with our missing fucking savior,

36:30.481 --> 36:33.401
we also appear to be short some apostles.

36:34.735 --> 36:38.281
Our friend Matthew, conspicuously absent.

36:39.574 --> 36:43.619
Fortunately, I will play
the part of Peter.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.082
You are already John.

36:51.294 --> 36:52.420
What about you, kid?

36:52.795 --> 36:56.340
You wanna be Simon, Bartholomew?

36:57.717 --> 36:59.218
- Pass.
- Oh...

37:01.804 --> 37:03.681
We all have to be somebody.

37:05.057 --> 37:08.477
Somebody who was there
at Christ's last huzzah.

37:09.228 --> 37:12.273
So that would make me Mary Magdalene.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.816
Hmm.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.234
That would be Nora.

37:16.152 --> 37:18.613
<i>Also conspicuously absent.</i>

37:19.822 --> 37:23.993
You, Dr. Garvey, are one apostle
and one apostle only.

37:24.994 --> 37:26.162
Thomas.

37:26.495 --> 37:27.872
Doubting Thomas.

37:28.664 --> 37:29.665
Mmm.

37:30.750 --> 37:34.253
When I first started hearing voices
back in Mapleton,

37:34.420 --> 37:38.257
everyone around me told me
I was fucking nuts. Everyone.

37:39.550 --> 37:41.135
Except you.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.804
You were the one person who believed me.

37:43.971 --> 37:46.933
You said those voices were really there.

37:51.687 --> 37:53.230
The next thing I knew,

37:55.191 --> 37:58.277
I was locked up
in a fucking mental institution.

38:01.405 --> 38:02.657
So you're wrong, Pop.

38:04.367 --> 38:05.868
I'm not Thomas.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.372
I'm Judas.

38:13.376 --> 38:16.963
Doubting is easy
because doubting costs you nothing.

38:18.714 --> 38:19.757
But Judas,

38:21.217 --> 38:27.723
he was surrounded by people going on
and on about how special Jesus was.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.517
But he betrayed him anyway.

38:31.060 --> 38:35.439
Because he was sure.
He believed in something.

38:36.857 --> 38:38.442
And he acted on it.

38:40.236 --> 38:41.737
And then he killed himself.

38:43.447 --> 38:44.490
What, sweetie?

38:46.701 --> 38:51.122
Judas collected his 30 pieces of silvers
and he hung himself.

38:53.082 --> 38:54.583
You all right?

38:56.085 --> 38:58.921
If he was so sure, why'd he kill himself?

39:01.966 --> 39:05.386
Well, Michael, I was not aware
of that part of the story.

39:07.096 --> 39:09.473
I have no idea why he killed himself.

39:11.308 --> 39:12.601
Did he leave a note?

39:16.772 --> 39:17.773
Hey.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.110
Hey, are you...

39:23.738 --> 39:24.780
<i>Hey.</i>

39:27.199 --> 39:28.367
Are you all right?

39:32.163 --> 39:33.164
<i>When?</i>

39:34.665 --> 39:35.750
He's fine.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.793
He's just sleeping.

39:44.341 --> 39:45.426
I'm sorry.

39:46.844 --> 39:48.262
It's true...

40:07.948 --> 40:10.076
I borrowed your pills.

40:35.101 --> 40:37.144
Looks real.

40:37.311 --> 40:38.938
Indeed, it does.

40:47.154 --> 40:51.575
So, is this the part where you call
the DSD and shut this operation down?

40:57.039 --> 41:00.751
Do you remember when we were kids,
after Mom and Dad died,

41:00.918 --> 41:05.214
when everyone at the church
wouldn't take their eyes off us?

41:05.881 --> 41:08.884
And they'd take us to the movies
and bowling and putt-putt

41:09.051 --> 41:10.386
just to keep us busy?

41:11.387 --> 41:12.638
Of course I do.

41:13.430 --> 41:16.308
And this one time,
they brought us to a baseball game,

41:17.434 --> 41:19.937
and I was too young
to get the rules, so I...

41:20.104 --> 41:23.274
I watched these people in another section
hitting a beach ball.

41:25.693 --> 41:27.903
And the whole stadium was getting into it.

41:28.821 --> 41:33.951
And when the ball came over to our seats,
you stood up and you just whacked it.

41:36.078 --> 41:38.831
It was the first time
I'd seen you smile in forever.

41:40.749 --> 41:42.960
But then the ball went into the aisle

41:44.587 --> 41:47.339
and this usher ran down and grabbed it

41:47.506 --> 41:50.885
and he picked it up,
and he just squeezed the air out of it.

41:53.137 --> 41:56.098
And then everyone started

41:56.807 --> 41:57.892
booing.

41:58.726 --> 42:02.855
Not just the people in our section,
but the whole stadium. Booing.

42:04.773 --> 42:07.234
He just ruined it for all of them.

42:09.195 --> 42:11.614
They just wanted to hit the ball.

42:22.833 --> 42:25.127
Why would he wanna do that job?

42:28.214 --> 42:29.840
Why would anyone?

42:35.846 --> 42:37.890
Because if he doesn't,

42:39.558 --> 42:41.644
that ball is gonna go onto the field,

42:44.438 --> 42:46.649
and it'll be fucking chaos.

43:18.347 --> 43:21.183
You can take the van.
I don't need it anymore.

43:31.777 --> 43:33.362
You wanna drive or should I?

43:34.947 --> 43:37.199
Actually, I think I'm gonna stay here
for a while.

43:37.366 --> 43:40.828
People should be
with their families, right?

43:42.037 --> 43:43.372
Okay.

43:45.374 --> 43:47.918
Can you, uh, give this to Senior

43:48.085 --> 43:52.423
and tell him I'm sorry
I didn't put him in my fucking book?

43:53.549 --> 43:55.509
And tell Kevin I'm sorry I did.

43:58.554 --> 43:59.805
Thank you.

44:03.851 --> 44:06.020
Do you have to tell them I did this?

44:10.816 --> 44:12.276
Give me a dollar.

44:13.444 --> 44:15.237
I only have 100s.

44:16.196 --> 44:17.698
Give me, um...

44:17.865 --> 44:19.241
Give me your cigarettes.

44:25.998 --> 44:28.167
Congratulations, Nora Durst.

44:28.334 --> 44:30.502
You are now officially my patient.

44:36.592 --> 44:38.052
Same time next week?

44:44.224 --> 44:45.559
You're on.

45:36.985 --> 45:37.986
Hi.

45:39.071 --> 45:40.072
Hey.

45:42.616 --> 45:43.992
John called you?

45:44.159 --> 45:45.577
Michael did.

45:49.164 --> 45:51.333
They said you were with Nora.

45:52.376 --> 45:53.544
I was.

45:55.754 --> 45:58.507
You help her find
what she was looking for?

46:00.300 --> 46:01.677
I think so.

46:24.366 --> 46:25.409
Where's everybody?

46:25.701 --> 46:27.744
Inside, sleeping.

46:29.455 --> 46:30.789
I drugged their food.

46:39.756 --> 46:40.883
Jesus, Laurie.

46:41.383 --> 46:44.094
Well, I wanted to talk to you.
Just the two of us.

46:44.261 --> 46:47.097
I didn't think they would let that happen.

46:48.098 --> 46:49.892
You know what they want me to do?

46:53.604 --> 46:55.564
You came here to talk me out of it?

46:57.900 --> 46:59.776
No. I'm here to say goodbye.

47:03.447 --> 47:04.531
<i>Want a cigarette?</i>

47:06.366 --> 47:07.367
Yeah.

47:28.597 --> 47:29.640
"Don't forget me."

47:39.733 --> 47:41.235
Is this the lighter Jill gave you?

47:44.988 --> 47:47.282
I threw it in a sewer grate
and then went back for it.

47:48.033 --> 47:49.618
Don't tell Jill that.

47:49.993 --> 47:51.119
That's nothing.

47:51.662 --> 47:52.996
I killed her hamster.

47:54.289 --> 47:55.541
- You what?
- Yeah.

47:57.334 --> 47:59.753
When you guys went down
to that mock UN thing,

48:00.712 --> 48:02.130
didn't fucking feed it.

48:02.297 --> 48:05.175
I went up there about an hour before
you got home and it was dead.

48:08.971 --> 48:12.015
Took it to the neighbor's trash
and threw it in there.

48:12.849 --> 48:14.351
Told you guys it ran away.

48:17.980 --> 48:20.524
Well, rest in peace, Mr. Fuzzy.

48:21.275 --> 48:22.401
Mr. Funny.

48:23.026 --> 48:25.070
It was Mr. Funny.

48:25.237 --> 48:27.489
That's right. It was Mr. fucking Funny.

48:32.077 --> 48:36.623
Remember that psychosomatic medical
conference thing I went to in Phoenix?

48:37.666 --> 48:39.167
I lasted two hours.

48:39.334 --> 48:41.920
And then I went to a spa
that cost $2,000 a night.

48:46.258 --> 48:47.467
I hated our house.

48:47.926 --> 48:49.052
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

48:50.887 --> 48:53.348
I mean, I didn't say anything
because it was your money that bought it.

48:53.515 --> 48:55.934
Well, you should've said something.
It was our house.

48:56.101 --> 48:57.144
You loved it.

48:58.353 --> 49:00.480
I wanted you to be happy.

49:06.862 --> 49:08.071
I was pregnant.

49:11.116 --> 49:12.117
What?

49:14.328 --> 49:15.621
I was pregnant.

49:16.580 --> 49:17.748
Sixteen weeks.

49:18.957 --> 49:19.958
I don't, uh...

49:21.251 --> 49:22.252
<i>When?</i>

49:26.381 --> 49:27.883
Seven years ago tomorrow.

49:31.845 --> 49:35.974
I was lying in the doctor's office,
staring at the ultrasound.

49:37.893 --> 49:39.144
Looking right at it.

49:40.270 --> 49:41.438
Then it was gone.

49:44.816 --> 49:46.652
Why didn't you tell me?

49:53.241 --> 49:55.410
I mean, we raised two beautiful kids.

49:59.748 --> 50:01.667
It's the best thing we ever did.

50:01.833 --> 50:03.043
The last best thing.

50:05.295 --> 50:06.755
Did you want another baby?

50:09.216 --> 50:10.258
No.

50:11.218 --> 50:12.344
Me neither.

50:18.100 --> 50:22.312
I didn't tell you
because I didn't want to. And then...

50:22.479 --> 50:24.064
Then I didn't have to.

50:37.160 --> 50:38.370
Are you scared?

50:42.416 --> 50:43.458
Scared of what?

50:45.627 --> 50:47.462
Scared of them strapping you to a seesaw

50:47.629 --> 50:50.465
and holding you under the water
until you drown.

50:53.260 --> 50:54.720
The last time it happened,

50:57.055 --> 50:59.141
where I went, that was so...

51:01.893 --> 51:03.145
It was real.

51:07.357 --> 51:10.861
Maybe I was dead,
but I had never felt so alive.

51:14.489 --> 51:16.241
But no, I'm not scared.

51:23.582 --> 51:25.167
Then I'm not scared either.

51:26.293 --> 51:28.879
And it could work, so I could come back.

51:29.838 --> 51:31.089
I really hope you do.

51:35.761 --> 51:36.845
Will you stay?

51:40.056 --> 51:41.308
I can't.

51:57.157 --> 51:58.366
Wait, wait, wait.

51:59.034 --> 52:00.869
Forgot your lighter.

52:01.203 --> 52:04.289
Uh, you can keep it. I quit.

52:09.377 --> 52:10.378
Thanks.

52:16.384 --> 52:17.719
Is Nora gone?

52:22.390 --> 52:23.725
We're all gone.

52:29.189 --> 52:30.774
Goodbye, Laurie.

52:37.072 --> 52:38.573
Goodbye, Kevin.

53:23.118 --> 53:25.996
Far out as I can take you
with that storm rolling in.

53:26.162 --> 53:28.707
If you're gonna go, you best go now.

53:31.126 --> 53:32.294
Okay.

54:09.164 --> 54:10.165
Hi, honey.

54:10.373 --> 54:13.835
<i>Mom, thank God you answered.
I have a very important question.</i>

54:14.753 --> 54:17.589
<i>- She doesn't know!
- Shut up! She's gonna remember.</i>

54:17.756 --> 54:21.635
<i>Mom, do you remember that one time
when I was, like, five</i>

54:21.801 --> 54:26.431
<i>and you found this videotape at a garage
sale and I was obsessed with it?</i>

54:26.598 --> 54:29.351
<i>Tell her she's making this up, Mom!
It doesn't exist.</i>

54:29.517 --> 54:31.811
<i>It does exist! I remember it.</i>

54:31.978 --> 54:34.314
<i>It had a mannequin that had this hat
that made it come to life</i>

54:34.481 --> 54:38.985
<i>and there was a goose on a rainbow
and this creepy guy puppet</i>

54:39.152 --> 54:41.446
<i>that, like, worked at a department store.</i>

54:41.905 --> 54:43.198
<i>Today's Special.</i>

54:43.365 --> 54:45.825
Today's Special! <i>Yes! Oh, my God.</i>

54:45.992 --> 54:49.913
<i>Fucking</i> Today's Special.
<i>Eat it, you fucker. Fuck, yes.</i>

54:50.330 --> 54:52.415
<i>- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- I knew you'd remember.</i>

54:52.582 --> 54:55.543
You know how many times
I had to listen to that theme song?

54:56.211 --> 54:58.463
<i>I'm really sorry I put you through that.</i>

54:58.630 --> 55:00.715
It was just a phase. I forgive you.

55:02.008 --> 55:05.845
<i>So, hey, Tommy said
Dad and Nora went to Australia?</i>

55:06.262 --> 55:08.181
<i>I tried calling them. What's up with that?</i>

55:08.348 --> 55:09.599
Who knows?

55:10.684 --> 55:12.978
<i>What are you doing right now?
Where are you?</i>

55:13.144 --> 55:14.145
Oh...

55:15.105 --> 55:16.856
I'm just hanging out.

55:17.023 --> 55:19.234
<i>By yourself? On the anniversary?</i>

55:20.318 --> 55:21.569
Yeah.

55:21.736 --> 55:25.073
It's, uh, kind of nice, actually.

55:26.074 --> 55:27.158
<i>Okay.</i>

55:27.325 --> 55:30.453
<i>Well, enjoy your solitude.</i>

55:31.955 --> 55:33.206
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

55:33.373 --> 55:35.250
I love you, honey.

55:35.417 --> 55:37.127
Tell Tommy I love him.

55:37.293 --> 55:39.129
<i>Mom loves you, you fucking idiot.</i>

55:39.379 --> 55:41.548
<i>I love you too, Mommy!</i>

55:41.715 --> 55:42.757
Bye, kids.

55:42.924 --> 55:44.175
<i>Bye. Love you.</i>

55:45.510 --> 55:46.761
<i>Miss?</i>

55:48.221 --> 55:49.681
Now or never.

58:00.270 --> 58:01.271
English-SDH
