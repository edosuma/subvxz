17:05.029 --> 17:08.014

TO STOP THIS CHICK?

17:08.016 --> 17:10.015
- THERE'S ONE...

17:10.017 --> 17:12.005
THE TIARA.

17:12.007 --> 17:14.001
IT IS THE KEY;

17:14.003 --> 17:18.019
THE ONE ITEM THAT ALLOWS
ALL THE MAGIC TO WORK.

17:18.021 --> 17:22.006
WITHOUT IT, THE OTHER ITEMS
ARE USELESS,

17:22.008 --> 17:25.009
INCLUDING THE TIARA ITSELF.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.027
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TIARA.

17:27.029 --> 17:31.006

17:38.013 --> 17:40.010
- THANKS, GUYS.

17:40.012 --> 17:41.023
- BLOSSOM?

17:41.025 --> 17:43.029
BRING HER DOWN FOR US!

17:47.016 --> 17:49.015
- DISTRACT HER,
GIRLS!

17:50.022 --> 17:53.005
- HA!

18:01.016 --> 18:03.016
- [GROWL]

18:03.018 --> 18:05.010

18:07.028 --> 18:15.008
N-N-NO! NO!

18:16.010 --> 18:19.004
WHOA!

YOU STILL HAD THESE,

18:31.029 --> 18:34.003
DON'T YA, COW!?

18:35.013 --> 18:37.029

COME TRUE.

18:38.001 --> 18:40.013
COME ON!
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:40.015 --> 18:43.009
- FOOL ME ONCE,
SHAME ON YOU.

18:43.011 --> 18:45.010
BUT FOOL ME TWICE?

18:48.016 --> 18:50.025
NO, THANKS!

18:50.027 --> 18:52.015
SHE'S ALL YOURS, GIRLS.

18:52.017 --> 18:54.003
COME ON, GUYS.

18:54.005 --> 18:56.002
LET'S HIT SOME VIDEO GAMES
AT THE MINI-MART.

18:57.022 --> 19:01.015

19:14.000 --> 19:15.029
'CAUSE YOU'RE IN JAIL!

19:16.001 --> 19:17.004
HA HA!

19:17.006 --> 19:18.023
- ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.

19:18.025 --> 19:20.028
- SEDUSA'S IN JAIL.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.002
