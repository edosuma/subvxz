Loren:
And that's when it hit me.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.815
I was at my most effective
in Spain

00:14.848 --> 00:17.418
because of the mid-day naps.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.763
So i started thinking... how can
i bring that siesta culture

00:19.787 --> 00:20.988
into the classroom?

00:21.021 --> 00:24.258
Is that why you replaced your
desk with this couch?

00:24.292 --> 00:25.859
It's called
"casual teaching."

00:25.893 --> 00:27.061
Feel free to hashtag it.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.029
I see a lot of head-scratching
going on.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.065
It's not that confusing.
It's pretty simple.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.033
Nothing can faze you
if you don't let it.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.736
They're not confused...
They have lice.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.870
Lice?

00:36.904 --> 00:38.215
Okay, everybody
out of the classroom.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.340
Everybody. I'm serious!

Move it, move it.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.843
Get out of here!
That's disgusting!

No time for order.
Just move it. Run!

now i have to bleach the floors.

I have to bug-bomb
the entire wing.

I have to burn all my books.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.778
Why are you freaking out
about this?

01:08.802 --> 01:10.247
Do you guys know what lice
are capable of?

01:10.271 --> 01:13.107
Dude, i was in a touring band
for most of my life.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.443
My head is 100% scar tissue.
I'm aware.

01:15.476 --> 01:18.246
Then you of all people
should know how
relentless they are.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.114
I got lice 11 times
in the second grade.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.949
They shaved my head
and called me "powder."

01:21.982 --> 01:23.917
- Kids are cruel.
- My parents did that.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.819
Ugh, i would have killed
for that nickname.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.256
I ripped my pants sliding down
a railing my freshman year

01:28.289 --> 01:29.790
and kids called me
"[Bleep] jeans"

01:29.823 --> 01:30.758
until i graduated.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.068
They called you "[Bleep] jeans"?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.394
Kids are hilarious!

01:33.427 --> 01:35.505
Yeah, well, they saw me
wearing a pair of borrowed pants

01:35.529 --> 01:37.307
from the lost and found
and assumed the worst.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.075
Yeah, you know what they say
when you assume...

01:39.099 --> 01:40.677
You probably actually
[Bleep] your jeans.

I'm not going
to the Quinn town hall.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.446
In case you haven't noticed,

01:52.480 --> 01:53.957
we're in the middle
of a lice pandemic out there.

01:53.981 --> 01:55.283
Lice?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.117
Well, this is the first
I'm hearing about it.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.595
Oh, well,
welcome to the party, Quinn.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.454
Oh, i like that fire, loren,
but, honestly,

02:00.488 --> 02:02.956
i think you're getting a little
worked up over nothing here.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.426
It's not nothing, okay?
This is a serious situation.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.304
There's something on the
kids. There's something
invisible on all the kids.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.962
Oh, fairbell, you, too?

02:08.996 --> 02:10.940
You guys are blowing this
out of proportion, all right?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.801
It's time you take a cue from
the q... stands for Quinn.

02:13.834 --> 02:14.868
- Yeah.
- Now, come here.

02:14.902 --> 02:15.836
I want to give you
a calming hug, okay?

02:15.869 --> 02:16.804
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

- No, it's on...

in my entire time
in the medical profession,

02:39.827 --> 02:42.663
and let me remind you, i have
seen Jose canseco's ballsac.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.873
So what are we gonna do
about it?

02:43.897 --> 02:45.533
This man needs medicated shampoo

02:45.566 --> 02:47.335
unless you want to shave
your beard.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.303
Yeah, right.
[ Chuckles ]

02:49.337 --> 02:51.705

before the biggest gig
of his life.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.510
Your town hall gig is shot,
Quinn.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.879
Those parents are gonna crucify
you over this lice thing.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.548
- Loren may be right here.
- Mm-hmm.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.182
I remember when Manny
got this in '06...

03:02.216 --> 03:04.017
Just ripped the clubhouse apart.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.520
I mean, we literally had to put
a cone on papi's head

03:06.554 --> 03:07.864
to keep him
from scratching himself.

03:07.888 --> 03:11.024
If it can divide bosox nation,
it is going to ruin smoot.

03:11.058 --> 03:13.527
You have to follow CDC protocol,
all right?

03:13.561 --> 03:15.729
Find patient zero,
contain the outbreak,

03:15.763 --> 03:17.030
clean up the hot zone.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.199
You seem to really know
your stuff on this, loren.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.269
How about you spearhead
the containment effort?

03:21.302 --> 03:22.770
How about that?
That is, of course,

03:22.803 --> 03:24.204
if Dr. Greene
is okay with it.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.239
There it is... canseco's.

- What is that?
- Is that just crazy?

03:26.640 --> 03:28.376
Is that the grossest thing
you've ever seen?

03:28.409 --> 03:29.943
That is like a fetus.
- I do not...

03:29.977 --> 03:31.779
- Look at it.
- I'm not gonna look at that.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.623
- Understand it and feel it.
- I'm not looking at it.

I am not looking at that.

the point on this one, okay?

03:38.452 --> 03:39.553
Fine.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.222

i want total authority.
