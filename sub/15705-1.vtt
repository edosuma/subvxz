00:38.725 --> 00:39.975
It is natural to speak from the heart.

00:41.975 --> 00:42.350
Well ... I guess my
story begins ..

00:49.558 --> 00:52.558
I was in town for the
sight of the dead

00:53.183 --> 00:54.433
And I was trying to get
entry, but needed a miracle ...

00:58.433 --> 00:59.267
And there was.

01:00.642 --> 01:02.933
My truck ran out of gas.

01:03.892 --> 01:06.392
So I left in a parking lot.

01:07.350 --> 01:08.600
The next day I woke
and saw a large building.

01:11.142 --> 01:12.392
And as I needed to go to the bathroom
then I stayed for the mass.

01:19.517 --> 01:23.267
I would have liked to go to show,
I thought I would come home ..

01:23.308 --> 01:23.683
But it was a great party
in the hotel room.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.683
It is always the same, when my
family and I go to church.

01:32.558 --> 01:36.350
We meet, play songs,
we are united ..

01:40.683 --> 01:41.183
People are good here

01:51.933 --> 01:53.183
"City on the Hill" Plan
a Christian community. Pronto.

02:26.392 --> 02:27.642
It began ... Carl!

02:32.017 --> 02:34.642
El Salvador, which was
the sins of this world ..

02:35.475 --> 02:37.767
And he opened the door to another world!

02:45.600 --> 02:46.850
- I can answer?
- Please.

02:47.558 --> 02:51.433
I have only one simple question: What
into with the Spanish Inquisition?

02:51.850 --> 02:55.600
9/11? The Holocaust?
-Disease? -Famine?

02:56.142 --> 02:59.892
Earthquakes -? Where has been
thousands of years of human suffering?

03:01.517 --> 03:10.183
if God exists, has been the most unfair, lazy
capricious bastard of all human history

03:19.642 --> 03:20.642
Ladies and gentlemen.

03:21.767 --> 03:25.767
Pastor Day, what has been
as evidence of the existence of God?

03:28.558 --> 03:31.225
I see evidence of it in
every place I look.

03:31.892 --> 03:34.850
In law, the
nature, culture

03:35.267 --> 03:37.808
In fact, we are in a
auditorium full of evidence!

03:38.267 --> 03:39.767
Is there evidence tonight?

03:40.517 --> 03:41.433
Here!

03:42.350 --> 03:44.433
- I see familiar faces ..
- Yes, my husband!

03:45.142 --> 03:46.850
Come on, son, stand up.

03:47.433 --> 03:48.558
- Is that Carl?
- Yes.

03:50.225 --> 03:51.017
Here we go ...

03:52.225 --> 03:55.433
Not so long ago, Carl was a lost soul

03:56.558 --> 04:00.725
He was a follower of a rock band
called "The Grateful Dead."

04:02.600 --> 04:04.808
"Dead head", is not it?

04:06.975 --> 04:12.933
"Dead head" which is the same
alcohol, promiscuous sex.

04:13.642 --> 04:17.183
Drugs, many drugs!

04:17.975 --> 04:21.808
That lifestyle brought you
much happiness, is not it Carl?

04:26.725 --> 04:30.725
True happiness does not come
to destroy our brains

04:31.308 --> 04:33.975
It comes from the plans
of God for us

04:34.475 --> 04:40.350
And the plans God had for him was to know
a beautiful girl named Gwen and his daughter Angie

04:40.975 --> 04:42.808
They joined the Christ!

04:44.100 --> 04:45.350
You now have a wonderful family.

04:46.808 --> 04:49.475
A job in a
department of my church

04:50.100 --> 04:52.517
But above all this .. love.

04:53.475 --> 04:57.475
He is a man transformed.
Did all this alone?

04:59.558 --> 05:02.975
The smell of God,
are on this man

05:03.600 --> 05:06.100
This is not madness, it is evidence!

05:11.100 --> 05:17.350
I would not call evidence, the
call: changing one drug for another

05:18.933 --> 05:19.600
We ..

05:20.892 --> 05:25.517
I prefer the first drugs to ...
least you know you're hallucinating.

05:26.350 --> 05:27.267
Please.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.308

We met at the church.

06:38.892 --> 06:42.183
In a moment you're in a van
with 9 people, and another ...

06:42.892 --> 06:44.475
You're up.

06:45.850 --> 06:50.142
It is rare ... How you doing?

06:55.225 --> 06:57.933
It was a pleasure to see you

06:59.475 --> 07:00.100
If ..

07:04.558 --> 07:06.017
Live and rock, Brother!

07:11.267 --> 07:16.183
Gwen and I have been thinking
an idea a few weeks ago.

07:17.058 --> 07:18.725
- We would like to say.
- Please.

07:19.558 --> 07:21.517
We want to open a movie theater.

07:22.267 --> 07:25.683
Where we offer a program
full of all Christian films.

07:26.600 --> 07:30.392
Of the 10 commandments
the passion of Christ ...

07:30.808 --> 07:32.225
I think that will be perfect for the city.

07:32.933 --> 07:35.433
- Who made this picture?
-Gwen.

07:36.725 --> 07:39.808

Are you embarrassed when you
I stop to introduce yourself?

07:59.225 --> 08:01.725
No, if it helps I think.

He knows he is an inspiration

08:11.933 --> 08:13.808
- Good performance
- Thanks

08:14.808 --> 08:15.975
A little aggressive sometimes.

08:16.475 --> 08:19.183
Even God does everything
necessary, Paul

08:20.433 --> 08:22.975
-He is Carl Vandemeer.
-Yes, the "dead head".

08:23.850 --> 08:25.558

08:51.975 --> 08:56.267
It's a great opportunity, make sure
to give it to Pastor Dan

Are not you coming?

man on earth.

- Thank you.

09:13.433 --> 09:15.058
No I did not ...

09:15.975 --> 09:16.642
Truth

09:18.558 --> 09:22.517
Then, Pastor .. a confession: I lied.

09:23.225 --> 09:26.683
Evangelists do not invite
discuss with me to take shots

09:28.058 --> 09:29.683
- Really?
- But ...

09:30.308 --> 09:32.933
You are different, a great opponent

09:34.142 --> 09:35.308
- Health
- Health.

09:37.392 --> 09:39.850
- There is something I want to propose.
- What is it?

09:40.725 --> 09:45.225
Both are authors of good books,
What if we do one together?

09:46.225 --> 09:48.975
A book about our
opposing views.

09:49.975 --> 09:52.017
Come to my place of rest,
and we recorded conversations ...

09:53.058 --> 09:55.433
We wrote everything in
a week, is beautiful ..

09:56.017 --> 09:56.767
Sure.

09:57.642 --> 10:02.517
So I have a degree. ". The big difference,
Paul Baylock and Pastor Dan Day

10:03.350 --> 10:03.892
What do you think?

10:04.975 --> 10:11.308
Paul, I'm a busy man, I have my
church, my projects, my own books.

10:14.142 --> 10:19.308
- But I must admit it's an interesting idea
- My agent thought the same.

10:19.725 --> 10:22.975
Could attract many unbelievers to Christ
-O believers to the right.

10:23.808 --> 10:27.392
Since the brothers virgins,
Mohamed's horses

10:29.767 --> 10:31.267
What do you Carl?

10:33.350 --> 10:34.600
Would you read a book?

10:36.600 --> 10:40.600
Always read books ...

10:41.058 --> 10:43.933
How do you think we should
start this conversation?

10:44.517 --> 10:47.350
Start at the beginning.
Where does religion?

10:47.933 --> 10:50.017
I assume you do not believe that came from God

10:50.808 --> 10:53.892
I agree with some of
our beloved founding fathers

10:54.433 --> 10:55.767
Wine of fear.

10:56.683 --> 11:00.558
Belief in the supernatural, is for
protect our fear of the unknown.

11:01.350 --> 11:06.808
Volcanoes, lightning, earthquakes,
rays. death, evil ...

11:07.725 --> 11:12.600
Somewhere along the
way, the supernatural God became

11:14.392 --> 11:19.475
And the stranger turned, Satan

11:21.683 --> 11:24.392
And if so, the question remains

11:25.642 --> 11:28.892
- Who is the judge between good and evil?
- Perfect.

11:29.517 --> 11:33.267
Without God. everything is permitted.

11:33.850 --> 11:37.350
It would be just a vicious circle
no reason to do good

11:37.892 --> 11:40.767
What would prevent us from
kill the poor Carl, now?

11:41.308 --> 11:43.225
- Fantastic, start collaboration.
- O you ..

11:49.642 --> 11:52.058
What happened? My God ...

11:54.558 --> 11:56.933
- What did you do?
- Professor Blaylock?

12:12.100 --> 12:14.433
- I'll call 911.
- No, do not

12:17.725 --> 12:18.975
Not breathing, Dan

12:25.350 --> 12:26.767
What are you doing?

12:47.433 --> 12:48.308
Dan

12:49.767 --> 12:50.808
Listen

12:52.892 --> 12:54.308
- Pastor Dan?
- Right?

12:59.892 --> 13:05.350
- What are we doing?
- Get in the car.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.017
Can you drive?

13:31.225 --> 13:32.183
Get in the car, Carl.

13:54.100 --> 13:58.892
Carl. know that a discussion of the project
"City in the hills, is in 2 days

13:59.517 --> 14:03.683
Chair, School of Law Schools .. ..

14:05.808 --> 14:07.267
All this will be crushed.

14:11.225 --> 14:11.892
Do not you see?

14:21.600 --> 14:25.392
Carl, you understand

14:28.142 --> 14:29.558
It is up to God

15:02.392 --> 15:03.558
911 -what is an emergency?

15:04.642 --> 15:10.808
Yes, I just heard a shot come ..
office of Paul Baylock.

15:11.808 --> 15:13.058

On campus

15:16.933 --> 15:18.225

-Carl, what happens? I

16:10.600 --> 16:12.600

16:16.517 --> 16:21.725
You know that over 1 million bats
die of something called white syndrome "?

16:22.808 --> 16:27.558
It is a white fungus that grows on
caves, which infects the nose

16:28.767 --> 16:32.183
And they die for it, but the
Scientists do not know why.

16:33.392 --> 16:36.767
- Where do you learn all this?
- The school asked Wiki

16:41.892 --> 16:43.058
There.

16:46.017 --> 16:49.975
- Mom says you have to kill him.
- I know you said it.

You know the evil in what you did

18:13.142 --> 18:14.558
The evil in you sleep.

18:19.475 --> 18:24.558
You disgust me, you're just an animal.

18:38.100 --> 18:41.392
- Daniel?
- If ..

18:43.725 --> 18:48.392

- A friend.

18:52.100 --> 18:56.975

23:40.558 --> 23:41.558
Thanks

23:42.892 --> 23:45.308
Welcome to the
Church of the 3rd millennium

23:46.058 --> 23:47.808
Camera 1, an approach to Dan

23:49.850 --> 23:51.100
I have sad news.

23:53.517 --> 23:54.767
Last night I had the great honor of
discussion with Professor Paul Blaylock.

23:59.183 --> 24:00.267
At the University.

24:01.517 --> 24:08.933
I just found out, last night, Professor
was found in his office on campus.

24:10.183 --> 24:13.892
Victim of a suicide attempt.

24:16.225 --> 24:20.642
The specialists will
operated during the night.

24:21.308 --> 24:23.017
They took the bullet.

24:23.683 --> 24:27.183
Fired, one of its
beloved antique pistols.

24:28.225 --> 24:33.808
And as we meet here with the
love in our hearts, and Jesus Christ ...

24:36.142 --> 24:38.850
The lies in a deep coma.

24:40.808 --> 24:43.433
Our prayers are
with him and his family.

24:46.975 --> 24:50.100
My sermon today, going to be about
changes in our community.

24:50.850 --> 24:55.767
But this incident has touched me
So I decided to talk about something else

24:56.683 --> 24:57.517
Spirituality.

24:58.517 --> 24:59.183
Music for Dan

25:01.142 --> 25:06.725
Sometimes we pretend we are not.

25:08.933 --> 25:12.058
For our friends and family
seem happy and content.

25:12.517 --> 25:17.267
But inside, we
feel alone and empty.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.433
Cut off from God

25:20.308 --> 25:23.892
Road to the darkness. No one
know our secrets.

25:26.017 --> 25:27.267
Listen to my words

25:28.767 --> 25:30.017
He declared war on
this crisis of spirit.

25:32.767 --> 25:34.017
It is the greatest evil
we can find!

25:36.017 --> 25:38.808
Its sole purpose is
our total destruction.

25:39.725 --> 25:41.058
Is that what Jesus wants from us?

25:43.475 --> 25:46.225
No, he wants to fight

25:47.058 --> 25:48.308
I ask each of you now,
ignite the spark in their hearts ...

25:50.558 --> 25:53.600
A spark that will become
flame, which will end the dark ...

25:54.142 --> 25:55.308
And traerб.la light!

25:56.225 --> 25:59.433
We must fight
this evil, and we will!

26:00.267 --> 26:04.267
And we will win! We will win!

26:13.225 --> 26:15.558
I wish everybody could
hear what he said.

26:16.850 --> 26:17.683
It is so important

26:18.100 --> 26:19.350
-Carl, you had no idea what could
happen, when you were with him last night?

26:22.183 --> 26:24.267
That man is
had nothing to live

26:24.933 --> 26:27.142
if not, believe in nothing,
not yourself.

26:28.267 --> 26:31.017
-Carl, we habar? Hi Jim, Gwen

26:31.558 --> 26:34.142
We're going. I have classes.

26:35.017 --> 26:36.100
See you at home at 12:20 as

26:36.642 --> 26:37.308
- Well
- Good. Goodbye.

26:38.017 --> 26:38.517
Wait a minute.

26:38.933 --> 26:41.850
I want to help, but
you gotta come with me.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.100
smiles and pretends that nothing is wrong

26:47.017 --> 26:47.850
What do you mean?

26:48.517 --> 26:50.392
Right now.

26:58.017 --> 26:58.517
See Jim

27:02.808 --> 27:04.058
-Jerry, what happens?
Do not talk, walk.

27:23.350 --> 27:23.808
Jerry?

27:27.017 --> 27:30.433
- Where are you parked?
- Section K

27:32.517 --> 27:33.558
We ..

27:42.058 --> 27:42.808
- Jerry ..
'Come on.

27:45.058 --> 27:46.308
- Where is your car, Carl?
-Turn left.

27:49.225 --> 27:50.183
I drive.

27:51.975 --> 27:53.142
The keys!

28:06.600 --> 28:07.767
What about Jerry?

28:09.392 --> 28:11.183
- Pastor Dan told me everything.
- Did he?

28:12.017 --> 28:14.558
And if you listen carefully
and do everything I say.

28:15.308 --> 28:16.725
I believe that everything can go well.

28:17.350 --> 28:22.142
- Please tell me it was all a big mistake
- It was an accident. You know?

28:22.850 --> 28:24.267
-Put the gun in his hand?

28:25.267 --> 28:27.767
- An error larger.
- It was a moment of panic

28:28.308 --> 28:28.892
Happened very fast.

28:29.517 --> 28:30.767
Are you willing to talk to the police?
-If I am ... I will.

28:34.475 --> 28:34.933
Well.

28:37.058 --> 28:38.308
- The thing is Carl ..
- If ..

28:38.892 --> 28:41.600
- Pastor Dan was not in the room
- Well .. What?

28:42.142 --> 28:44.392
He wanted to call the
police, but did not

28:45.017 --> 28:46.308
- Do you know why?
- Why?

28:47.475 --> 28:51.058
He loves you, Carl.
And he wants to protect you.

28:52.433 --> 28:56.058
The only way that everything goes
well. It is to admit it or you did.

28:56.725 --> 28:58.433
- And let him out.
- What did I do?

28:58.933 --> 28:59.350
Yo, what?

28:59.808 --> 29:02.433
You shot this guy, and
tried to look like a suicide

29:03.058 --> 29:04.433
- Jerry, not
- Carl I have to.

29:05.017 --> 29:05.850
Dan was

29:06.683 --> 29:09.600
When Bedilia was doing that in the
Parri, you saw that I went crazy

29:10.100 --> 29:11.392
That did not happen.

29:11.933 --> 29:14.433
- For the car right now
- But no one ever and shoot!

29:16.433 --> 29:17.683
I want you out of my car, now!

29:22.392 --> 29:22.850
Well.

29:35.558 --> 29:39.308
- What are we doing here?
- Come on.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.475
Jerry?.

29:46.433 --> 29:47.392
Hey

30:01.183 --> 30:02.433
Remember the story
Abraham and Isaac?

30:04.308 --> 30:05.308
From studies of the Bible.

30:07.850 --> 30:09.933
If the father and son. that came out ...

30:10.392 --> 30:11.642
God told Abraham to take his
son Isaac to the desert and sacrifice him.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.350
Abraham loved his
son, with all his heart.

30:24.183 --> 30:26.725
'But I loved God more.
-Jerry, Isaac was innocent!

30:29.850 --> 30:31.100
And God changed his mind and
Abraham said to let him go.

30:34.392 --> 30:35.642
- It was a test!
- That's not the point!

30:41.517 --> 30:42.350
Are you right or left handed?

30:44.350 --> 30:45.600
- Answer!
- I'm left handed.

30:48.017 --> 30:49.267
Well.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.933
Get on your knees and ask forgiveness.

30:56.850 --> 30:58.100
We ..

31:02.308 --> 31:03.142
Close your eyes.

31:04.517 --> 31:05.225
Well.

31:09.058 --> 31:10.308
-I said that the hills!
'All right, Jerry.

31:11.933 --> 31:13.975
Jerry, what do you do?

31:15.017 --> 31:15.767
We are friends.

31:17.183 --> 31:21.017
Our children are friends I left
to a barbecue at my house!

31:21.600 --> 31:24.017
- Why do this?
- Why do you force me, Carl?

31:25.558 --> 31:26.808
Someone has to
stop you. 'll Carry this cross.

31:30.558 --> 31:34.392
In this mission, I am your Abraham.

31:45.017 --> 31:45.558
-Carl?

32:00.517 --> 32:05.392
-Carl, you just
happen? What is happening?

32:12.975 --> 32:14.933
- Hello?
- Angie, where are you?

32:14.975 --> 32:16.183
I do not know, I just woke up

32:16.933 --> 32:18.850
Mom, I think Carl
just killed someone

32:18.892 --> 32:23.100
Mom ..

32:26.975 --> 32:27.600
-Gwen?

32:28.850 --> 32:30.308
What did you do?

32:34.392 --> 32:37.975
I think we will have
to re-call.

32:38.892 --> 32:40.058
- Is everything all right?
- We're good.

32:40.767 --> 32:42.225
Are you driving, where are you ...?

32:48.975 --> 32:54.517
- Who was that?
- Jerry, honey. Jerry Habson.

33:02.392 --> 33:03.058
Open the trunk.

33:58.558 --> 34:01.933
Suddenly, he put a gun to
my head, and she left the car.

34:02.308 --> 34:03.600
And I hit him in the head with a rock.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.892
I dragged him to the car.
going to kill me had a gun

34:12.100 --> 34:13.475
It's crazy.

34:13.891 --> 34:17.600
No, it's completely. I screwed up everything.

34:17.975 --> 34:19.058
Take care of the language

34:19.975 --> 34:23.058
It makes no sense.

34:23.641 --> 34:26.391
What I mean is that
you are completely crazy.

34:27.641 --> 34:28.266
Well.

34:29.058 --> 34:35.558
I know that Dan would not do anything
and ever. Although an accident

34:36.100 --> 34:38.766
I saw it with my own eyes

34:39.266 --> 34:43.350
In the same way I saw Jerry
levarme the wilderness to kill me.

34:43.808 --> 34:47.350
- Jerry. That of Bedilia?
- What did Mom

34:47.933 --> 34:49.308
- That's ridiculous.
- No, Jim ...

34:50.350 --> 34:52.475
Why did you bring? I told you ...

34:53.100 --> 34:57.141
Because he thought you were
involved in something shady ...

34:59.517 --> 35:05.225
dreamed that killed this Pastor
teacher, and now what Jerry hallucinate.

35:05.892 --> 35:10.600
Honey? That's it!
This morning you had a nightmare.

35:11.392 --> 35:15.850
All this with Dan, was the nightmare
you could not remember. Yes!

35:16.308 --> 35:16.933
- Gwen ..
- That's

35:17.517 --> 35:19.558
And Jerry, I'm sure
that was a misunderstanding

35:20.433 --> 35:23.100
Bedilia told me
Jerry dieting.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.100
That made affect your blood sugar.

35:25.600 --> 35:30.100
Gwen went crazy
... Do I have turned right?.

35:30.725 --> 35:32.142
- It was scary
- Crazy!

35:33.058 --> 35:34.308
Honey, no one hurt

35:35.475 --> 35:37.975
You played with the mind of this
girl like you do with it.

35:38.683 --> 35:39.933
Honey, why do not you tell
Dan from your sleep?

35:41.225 --> 35:41.975
The mean

35:42.558 --> 35:45.892
People have nightmares
all the time. Talk to him.

35:46.475 --> 35:47.933
Are you listening?

35:49.058 --> 35:50.475
As of tonight

35:51.100 --> 35:51.975
Are you listening?

35:52.600 --> 35:57.100
When I was in the Navy. I could see in the
eyes of anyone and know if he was drugged.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.558
And you, my friend, you're

36:00.767 --> 36:07.017
So whatever it is. Need
tell me live, right now.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.100
-Carl?

36:16.475 --> 36:17.267
Okay ..

36:18.933 --> 36:22.683
First I have to pee.

36:58.433 --> 36:59.100
Leave a message.

37:13.933 --> 37:14.767
-I can help?

37:16.683 --> 37:18.475
We saw the other night

37:19.558 --> 37:20.308
In the auditorium.

37:21.642 --> 37:22.767
Hello.

37:24.017 --> 37:25.517
What's up, doc?

37:27.600 --> 37:29.142
Did you hear what the teacher Blaylock?

37:30.433 --> 37:31.683
I need to talk

37:33.683 --> 37:34.808
Shit!

37:35.558 --> 37:36.558
Are you kidding?

37:37.517 --> 37:38.558
- Is the Pastor?
- Yes.

37:39.308 --> 37:40.933
Does the pastor of the
Church of the 3rd millennium?

37:41.475 --> 37:43.600
What was on this campus last night?

37:44.975 --> 37:47.017
There is a security camera,
the other side of this building.

37:47.642 --> 37:50.183
What can keep us saved,
coming after it happened.

37:50.933 --> 37:52.142
The police will look and can ..

37:54.350 --> 37:57.767
- What do you mean?
- That was the first thing they did this morning

37:59.767 --> 38:00.308
Well.

38:02.433 --> 38:03.058
Here it comes.

38:11.142 --> 38:12.392
And there he goes.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.058
- That was not what happened!
- Are you sure?

38:17.683 --> 38:19.433
Sure I'm sure was there

38:20.058 --> 38:22.850
You have to fix this. Put it

38:23.767 --> 38:24.225
Come on.

38:24.892 --> 38:26.600
I can not fix it. It was.

38:27.350 --> 38:28.517
Does anyone could change it?

38:29.475 --> 38:34.933
If you know how to edit it, change the times and
even so, would have to go here first

38:37.058 --> 38:38.308
I was here until 10.
Then there was nobody to 7 Am

38:41.183 --> 38:44.058

38:44.558 --> 38:49.267

38:52.475 --> 38:56.058
Man! More than 100
people have access.

38:56.683 --> 38:58.475
Professionals
security, as we

38:59.350 --> 39:00.100
And the technical

39:01.642 --> 39:04.142
- Those who tend to walk with the teams.

Jesus .. please help me

39:18.100 --> 39:21.767
Show me a sign,
and at that very moment.

39:23.933 --> 39:27.183
The light turned green,
and turn right.

39:28.433 --> 39:31.475
And what was the end of the
street? The church of 3rd millennium.

39:32.475 --> 39:34.475
That was Jesus, saying
I had to join God

39:35.600 --> 39:38.892
And along the way. Dan Day.

39:42.725 --> 39:44.100
Thank you Jesus!

39:55.058 --> 39:59.350
I met 3 people that day,
I changed my life

40:01.433 --> 40:02.225
Hello?

40:02.808 --> 40:06.308
He said he had a plan for my

40:07.100 --> 40:08.350
- Got the picture?
- Yes.

40:10.100 --> 40:16.017
... Angie. which is the first person to
I really feel needed

40:23.392 --> 40:24.642
At 2 Hello!

40:26.058 --> 40:27.058
- Nice to see you
- Nice.

40:27.683 --> 40:28.850
- Good to see them.
- Pastor ...

40:29.558 --> 40:31.017
Please feel like home.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.433
Do you give, you need more?

40:35.225 --> 40:37.475
No Thanks Bedilia. Do not
worry about me, thanks

40:38.308 --> 40:39.308
Nice to see you, Bedidlia.

40:41.267 --> 40:44.267
Thanks for coming today, how are you?

40:44.892 --> 40:45.808
Always great!

40:46.517 --> 40:47.017
Well!

40:49.142 --> 40:51.767
It was a strange day.

40:54.017 --> 40:56.225
Is there something wrong with Bedilia?

40:58.767 --> 41:00.933
- I do not know how to say this ..
- Is it about Carl?

41:01.892 --> 41:03.142
Apparently, Carl attacked Jerry.

41:05.933 --> 41:07.475
- God
- For god.

41:09.058 --> 41:10.892
As Bedilia is a little annoying.

41:11.808 --> 41:14.433
Jerry is right, just
has a couple of points.

41:15.267 --> 41:18.683
Not angry, just
very concerned about Carl.

41:19.350 --> 41:20.475
It is very strange.

41:22.225 --> 41:23.475
-We saw it at lunch ...
- Did you see today, after Mass?

41:27.683 --> 41:30.183
Yes, says Jerry
attacked him, who lived crazy

41:31.600 --> 41:35.850
This incident with the teacher
Blaylock, Carl affected

41:36.975 --> 41:37.933
Much, indeed

41:38.517 --> 41:44.475
Tell me ... Do you have any
background in a family?

41:46.725 --> 41:47.975
How genetic?

41:51.058 --> 41:54.350
Paranoia, depression, violence.

41:55.100 --> 41:55.850
Would not surprise me.

41:56.392 --> 42:00.225
In any case I think this
Carl has plunged into something dark ...

42:00.767 --> 42:03.600
Like I said this
my sermon tomorrow

42:04.142 --> 42:05.308
Spiritual crisis.

42:05.933 --> 42:07.183
At this time, Carl
has lost its way

42:10.642 --> 42:11.475
-Lamamos the police?

42:12.225 --> 42:15.975
Do not do that, it is better
that is in your community ...

42:16.683 --> 42:18.100
Better than being in jail.

42:18.808 --> 42:20.642
Here we have all the
resources for care.

42:21.225 --> 42:24.433
In fact ... I myself will attend

42:26.350 --> 42:28.558
I'll give Jerry Hadson number.

42:31.517 --> 42:34.017
It is very important to say
Carl concerns.

42:34.058 --> 42:34.142
It is very important to say
Carl concerns.

42:34.642 --> 42:35.892
-Absolutely.
Otherwise, ...

42:39.892 --> 42:40.767
What will the police

42:43.850 --> 42:45.058
Something much more serious.

42:46.975 --> 42:47.600
Right.

42:49.475 --> 42:52.933
It means that the arrest

42:54.933 --> 42:56.350
.. We pray together.

43:11.767 --> 43:13.600
Look at that color ..

43:14.767 --> 43:15.350
The has

43:17.558 --> 43:18.933
Our proposition.

43:19.683 --> 43:23.142
Yes, I was about to read

43:26.308 --> 43:28.517
Dear Jesus, I call it.

43:30.183 --> 43:36.558
we pray to you, dear Jesus. that houses the
James and Gwen souls, in your dear arms ...

43:38.017 --> 43:42.183
Because they have lost a sheep,
and Carl is breaking.

43:44.683 --> 43:46.267
Bring it back

43:49.100 --> 43:57.100
That was not a suicide, I knew
30 years ago and never saw him depressed.

43:57.642 --> 44:01.892
This is crazy. I will habar
with the police, I'll tell ...

44:02.392 --> 44:03.017
Wait!

44:03.433 --> 44:04.683
Half of the police love to Pastor Dan
They go to the cathedral almost every day.

44:07.433 --> 44:09.808
To do ... whatever you do there.

44:10.267 --> 44:11.767
What if I get arrested?

44:23.058 --> 44:23.558
What?

44:33.100 --> 44:34.350
As a million left.

44:36.642 --> 44:39.725
i no threat of
jail .. always helps.

44:40.850 --> 44:41.808
Trust me

44:45.100 --> 44:49.183
.. I do not know if it is a good idea

44:50.933 --> 44:52.267
I've been clean a long time.

44:55.225 --> 44:58.767
I understand. But life is hard.

45:00.433 --> 45:03.642
My damn boyfriend, guitarist,
just finished with me.

45:05.808 --> 45:09.433
I was on the road 6 months
Guess he does not I have sex.

45:10.683 --> 45:11.183
-6 months?

45:14.142 --> 45:17.892
My nerves are on edge
skin. and not even going to prison.

45:18.392 --> 45:20.933
No, do not know if that will happen with me.

45:21.600 --> 45:23.808
You'll be fine, if you
keep clean there.

45:24.433 --> 45:28.350
No sex, drugs ... As the church.

45:30.808 --> 45:31.683
While there is time ..

45:48.225 --> 45:50.183
- Sorry.
- No.'s fine.

45:58.225 --> 45:59.600
There are small.

46:14.142 --> 46:17.183
How is it official? Jim
Hunt, retired from the Navy.

46:18.350 --> 46:21.808
Do you know of the incident
Baylock this morning?

46:22.475 --> 46:25.225
Suicide UWU, ask
by Detective ASSR.

46:25.808 --> 46:26.683
Thanks

46:40.392 --> 46:43.225
- What am I looking at?
'That belongs to me.

46:45.267 --> 46:49.350
I gave it to Pastor Dan Day, night

46:50.558 --> 46:55.058
Today, I found him in his office.

46:56.433 --> 46:58.058
And you want
ask for that blood.

47:10.600 --> 47:15.892
I will open an investigation. but while
both need to remain silent.

47:16.642 --> 47:17.642
This is the procedure ...

47:18.642 --> 47:19.892
Copying.

47:25.100 --> 47:26.350
Do you I can ask you something?.

47:28.767 --> 47:29.433
What?

47:30.267 --> 47:32.767
Ever on the shows..?

47:34.225 --> 47:48.475
Somehow, you start to believe
band that controls everything

47:49.433 --> 47:54.142
Not just music but all ..
details

47:55.100 --> 47:55.642
Yes.

47:56.808 --> 47:58.058
I feel that way now.

47:58.975 --> 47:59.683
I know!

48:06.225 --> 48:07.892
I'm the one who controls everything.

48:10.850 --> 48:11.392
If ...

48:12.850 --> 48:13.683
Control.

48:14.683 --> 48:23.267
The song, the clouds.
Sun to light your ..

48:26.142 --> 48:30.600
This truck, with the Virgin Mary.

48:31.892 --> 48:34.142
Control it now.

48:54.100 --> 48:55.350
Out of the car!

48:56.933 --> 48:58.183
I am not the one!

48:59.100 --> 49:00.350
Not me!

49:02.350 --> 49:03.600
Carl!

49:05.975 --> 49:07.642
I tell them they have to
wrong man!

49:20.517 --> 49:22.600
Fuck you!

49:23.892 --> 49:25.142
God tells Noah
I'm going to flood the earth.

49:26.933 --> 49:28.725
And I need you to build a boat.

49:29.350 --> 49:30.975
To save you and your animals.

49:32.725 --> 49:36.100
And Noah felt something, what was it?

49:37.142 --> 49:37.975
- Yes?
- Good.

49:38.517 --> 49:39.475
Yes.

49:40.308 --> 49:43.183
But Noah, also hesitated.

49:44.725 --> 49:47.933
Because he had never seen rain

49:49.808 --> 49:53.350
Then, before the flood,
How drew water from the earth?

49:55.933 --> 49:58.892
He pulled it out from the bottom up.

49:59.850 --> 50:00.308
Yes?

50:02.183 --> 50:03.975
Do you talk about the sand volcanoes?

50:05.392 --> 50:08.308
Because the rain was long before
people populate the planet

50:09.017 --> 50:10.392
And icy comets came from.

50:12.767 --> 50:15.517
Not know much about comets
frozen but what if ...

50:16.308 --> 50:19.058
Is it difficult, is humility.

50:20.267 --> 50:24.183
And the humble, always
obey the word of God.

50:27.808 --> 50:29.642
You know that these classes are a blessing.

50:30.808 --> 50:35.017
Not only learn the scriptures, but as a
part of the community and that is for a lifetime.

50:35.892 --> 50:39.767
Sorry to be a little tough,
but I want to respect that.

50:42.017 --> 50:44.600
There are many girls in the world
they do not have what your

50:45.517 --> 50:49.725
They have been through painful

50:50.433 --> 50:52.017
I think I should not go
the dance tonight.

50:53.600 --> 50:54.225
What?

50:54.892 --> 50:58.100
Mom is a father-daughter dance and
if Carl is not going to be there for ..

50:58.683 --> 51:04.017
This is not about Carl's return,
and will be there. Do not think that ..

51:07.142 --> 51:08.392
Honey, answer for me.

51:09.642 --> 51:11.392
There is no reason to
think it will not go

51:11.975 --> 51:12.683
It's probably him.

51:13.392 --> 51:13.808
Hello?

51:17.100 --> 51:18.058
Mom. is Betty.

51:18.933 --> 51:20.350
He saw that Carl had an accident

51:22.100 --> 51:23.350
What?

51:34.058 --> 51:35.308
Carl Vandermeer, white, 39 years.

51:39.350 --> 51:39.850
Where is Carl?

51:41.058 --> 51:42.308
Official permission ... that
is our truck.

51:47.017 --> 51:48.183
Is Mr. Vandermeer?

51:48.975 --> 51:50.892
Yes. Where is my husband?

51:51.808 --> 51:54.475
It seems that there was a kidnapping.

51:55.142 --> 51:56.725
My husband, where is it?

51:57.392 --> 51:58.600
Well, we're trying to find out.

52:00.017 --> 52:01.350
Excuse me, Who is this woman?

52:02.100 --> 52:02.558
Hello.

52:03.142 --> 52:06.850
She was in the vehicle
when the incident occurred

52:07.558 --> 52:10.225
- You were in my car?
- Yes.

52:11.850 --> 52:15.058
- What were you doing in my car?
- Passing a while.

52:15.558 --> 52:16.475
What were you doing with my husband?

52:16.933 --> 52:18.725
- What were you doing with my husband?
- I need to calm down.

52:19.183 --> 52:19.892
No need to calm down.

52:20.517 --> 52:22.475
I am not the problem here!

52:23.392 --> 52:25.100
She looks like a drug addict. Did you talk to her?

52:26.058 --> 52:28.058
Is this what it is, drugs?

52:28.767 --> 52:34.267
- My husband were trying drugs?
-To my knowledge, your pastor killed the professor.

52:35.975 --> 52:36.433
Mama!

52:36.850 --> 52:37.350
Mama!

52:38.600 --> 52:39.308
It is dangerous!

52:40.767 --> 52:42.017
I have proof of your spirituality!

52:43.558 --> 52:44.808
-Is the word of God
- Mom!

52:46.267 --> 52:46.808
Mom!

52:50.392 --> 52:51.850
I get it.

53:16.892 --> 53:17.600
Paul?

53:20.892 --> 53:21.558
Are you listening?

53:29.308 --> 53:32.725
Go night. that night

53:35.850 --> 53:37.850
You will spend time to
write this book together

53:38.933 --> 53:40.892
I know you're upset
me, I would

53:42.600 --> 53:43.350
I was afraid.

53:45.350 --> 53:48.433
For the first time in
long time, I fear.

53:50.808 --> 53:52.142
But then I remembered something ..

53:53.517 --> 53:55.725
This was not an accident

53:57.600 --> 53:59.350
Rather, they wanted this to happen.

54:05.017 --> 54:08.017
You called Satan. the unknown.

54:09.392 --> 54:13.808
I put the trap, and
then at the right time ...

54:20.933 --> 54:21.850
It was ingenious.

54:23.350 --> 54:26.183
All parts were perfectly
arranged, you, me, Carl ..

54:26.767 --> 54:28.058
Carl, the lost sheep

54:32.683 --> 54:36.517
Sometimes a wolf comes
sheep, with a mission ..

54:37.058 --> 54:41.642
Pastor kill and destroy the flock,
and leave them bleeding on the ground.

54:45.100 --> 54:47.100
But we must not let that happen

54:48.350 --> 54:52.975
And you were the soldier .. terrible

54:53.558 --> 54:56.183
And now you want to go, because there
think there's something after this

54:56.683 --> 54:57.850
You're afraid, as I had.

54:58.808 --> 55:06.892
But you have that, just
to accept Christ into your heart

55:10.392 --> 55:12.892
Accept the gift of eternal life.

55:18.225 --> 55:23.225
I know you want it Paul Give me a sign.

55:39.225 --> 55:45.017
Father in heaven. We thank you,
by accepting Paul, in your dear arms

55:46.142 --> 55:48.142
He has earned his place in your kingdom

55:49.475 --> 55:53.183
Write your name in
your book Thank you, Father.

56:35.267 --> 56:35.933
Are you awake

56:38.100 --> 56:39.100
Are you okay? ,

56:41.100 --> 56:42.350
I am Jorge Vaca Guzman.

56:47.225 --> 56:48.475
I'm Carl.

56:49.017 --> 56:53.392
I know exactly who you are welcome
San Miguel, Mr. Vandermeer

56:54.017 --> 56:55.267
San -what?
-A 3 hours from Mexico City.

56:57.183 --> 56:59.683
Nice view, is not it?
-Ray ... Am I in Mexico?

57:02.475 --> 57:03.850
Yes. You are my guest.

57:04.558 --> 57:08.183
Sorry about the method used and
had to take drugs to bring

57:08.642 --> 57:13.142
But it was for your safety because there
a very dangerous man looking for you.

57:13.767 --> 57:15.433
And this is what makes a friend

57:16.100 --> 57:17.225
- Friend?
- Yes, friend.

57:17.933 --> 57:20.142
A friend is when there are no secrets

57:20.767 --> 57:25.183
But if there was a small
secret, no problem.

57:25.683 --> 57:28.392
Because friends
secret trust

57:29.392 --> 57:31.142
- Yes?
- Yeah, I guess ...

57:31.683 --> 57:38.433
And if someone in whom they trust
your secrets, this is not your friend.

57:40.725 --> 57:41.975
But what is this? follow me.

58:11.183 --> 58:12.600
That's it!

58:14.517 --> 58:15.392
Thank you.

58:15.808 --> 58:17.392
- Do not touch me!
'Thank you, sorry.

58:18.142 --> 58:19.850
But that is how was this?

58:20.517 --> 58:22.600
I've been following the
Pastor Dan for a while

58:23.183 --> 58:24.183
- Why?
- Why?

58:24.725 --> 58:27.600
Because when you go to a priest,
at the end, you have something amazing

58:28.600 --> 58:29.517
Well ..

58:30.392 --> 58:32.558
Do not worry, please.
Take a seat.

58:33.683 --> 58:34.392
Sure.

58:36.642 --> 58:41.100
Mr. Vandemeer, I would like to write
Some things you say Can we?

58:41.683 --> 58:42.475
What things?

58:43.433 --> 58:45.142
With his words. Ready? Let us begin.

58:46.683 --> 58:52.058
I, Carl Vandemeer, in my
sane, testified.

58:52.600 --> 58:57.475
I witnessed the shooting of the innocent,
unbeliever, Professor Baylock.

58:58.058 --> 58:58.433
Yes.

58:58.892 --> 59:00.350
By the pastor. Daniel Day.

59:01.308 --> 59:06.892
And also witnessed. that Mr. Day put
the murder weapon in the hands of the teacher.

59:07.350 --> 59:08.267
To look like a suicide

59:10.767 --> 59:14.600
- In this video, all may end ...
- Yes, please put a date and sign it.

59:15.267 --> 59:17.683
- I will not have to go to prison.
- Sure, that's the idea!

59:18.225 --> 59:20.725
And Dan does not have to go to prison, it can
say it was an accident, or whatever.

59:20.767 --> 59:23.308
And Dan does not have to go to prison, it can
say it was an accident, or whatever.

59:23.975 --> 59:24.517
Everybody wins.

59:25.600 --> 59:27.142
But we're not done with the letter.

59:27.975 --> 59:28.558
One more.

59:30.142 --> 59:33.683
By the way, you very well. Would you like peanuts?

59:34.850 --> 59:36.100
Thank you.

59:36.558 --> 59:37.558
Ready? We

59:38.808 --> 59:41.392
I, Carl Vandemeer, in my right.

59:42.017 --> 59:43.267
I'm here to ... etc ...

59:44.433 --> 59:47.850
Because deprived people
know the love of God in heaven ...

59:48.767 --> 59:50.017
And dragged them into the worship
hell and Lucifer!

59:53.392 --> 59:55.892
I attempt on the life of
unbeliever, Professor Baylock.

59:57.433 --> 59:58.017
I attempt on the life of
unbeliever, Professor Baylock.

59:58.558 --> 59:59.475
Headshots.

01:00:01.392 --> 01:00:02.642
- What is happening here?
-Mr. Vandemeer ...

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:06.225
- What is happening here?
- Mr Vandemeer

01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:10.892
Let me tell you
where it came from my wealth.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:21.142
The houses, built pools .. I

01:00:22.892 --> 01:00:25.558
Now I have the possibility of
build an entire city in the north.

01:00:26.517 --> 01:00:29.850
A city of 1 trillion
dollars on the hill.

01:00:30.808 --> 01:00:33.642
And I'll give these confessions
My friend Dan what we all want.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.058
An option.

01:00:36.808 --> 01:00:42.267
If you choose this role, he works
me and prosper.

01:00:42.767 --> 01:00:44.017
If you choose this, you will see your city
and his life crumble before your eyes.

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:53.267
Date and signature. Eat, drink,
no, you're my guest.

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.558
Please enjoy what you want
the place is beautiful.

01:00:56.475 --> 01:00:57.725
Sure, you can not leave the property.

01:00:59.642 --> 01:01:01.558
I can not? How long?

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.850
The leading building the city.

01:01:09.642 --> 01:01:10.850
What if I do not?

01:01:13.433 --> 01:01:15.183
I'll introduce you to my cat.

01:01:16.433 --> 01:01:20.183
And it is the little white
and black, they have in the EU

01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:24.433
It's a special cat

01:01:24.475 --> 01:01:24.683
It's a special cat

01:01:25.433 --> 01:01:27.017
And has 9 tails.

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:30.017
And if you do not write.
exactly what I said

01:01:30.642 --> 01:01:31.892
'I hit you with that cat.
- Okay.

01:01:33.058 --> 01:01:34.308
And you get every last drop of blood.
-I get it.

01:01:36.975 --> 01:01:39.475
And then you amarrarй to a cross,
and you throw in the mountains

01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:43.058
I think this deserves a toast.

01:01:44.142 --> 01:01:45.392
My friend, for the city in the hills

01:01:45.433 --> 01:01:46.017
My friend, for the city in the hills.

01:01:59.308 --> 01:02:08.725
- I came as soon as I heard
- If Gwen is ... .. see for yourself

01:02:32.475 --> 01:02:33.058
-Gwen?

01:02:35.475 --> 01:02:35.933
-Gwen?

01:02:40.892 --> 01:02:41.308
Hello.

01:02:47.475 --> 01:02:51.475
I was trying to
clear your head

01:02:53.475 --> 01:02:54.183
Painting a little.

01:02:55.433 --> 01:02:58.100
I see .. What is this Gwen, you do?

01:03:01.933 --> 01:03:03.642
He'll think I went crazy.

01:03:04.392 --> 01:03:06.808
No, of course not.

01:03:07.808 --> 01:03:08.683
This is ..

01:03:10.892 --> 01:03:19.475
Well, I think it Carl
leading drug traffickers.

01:03:21.142 --> 01:03:25.683
That could be, or
not possessed by demons.

01:03:26.517 --> 01:03:30.433
But more than that,
I think the devil ...

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:37.058
Are trying to use drugs, women,
.. sex is trying to get away!

01:03:37.725 --> 01:03:39.725
It is sinking in
the sea of ??confusion.

01:03:40.267 --> 01:03:41.433
It is moving away from the family.

01:03:42.475 --> 01:03:43.725
And as you
said of the dark

01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:49.975
The evil forces that drag
spiritual warfare against us.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.642
Blaylock took the teacher and
now trying to take my Carl.

01:03:57.642 --> 01:04:00.600
But you're not
looking at is the eye of God

01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:07.683
Expected to be the eye of the ticket.

01:04:09.767 --> 01:04:11.267
You have done well

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.350
God gives us tests,
but we always take care

01:04:15.933 --> 01:04:17.933
Everything that happens has a cause.

01:04:19.183 --> 01:04:23.267
- Nothing happens by accident
-In the end, everything will be fine

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.225
Carl is in the hands of God.

01:04:28.308 --> 01:04:29.392
We can only trust.

01:04:30.642 --> 01:04:31.225
Trust

01:04:48.267 --> 01:04:49.058
I'm going to paint.

01:04:51.892 --> 01:04:52.642
Well.

01:04:53.975 --> 01:04:54.433
Mom?

01:04:56.683 --> 01:04:58.267
Girl, look at you.

01:05:03.183 --> 01:05:06.517
'You're going to sweep the floor.
- Bella.

01:05:16.433 --> 01:05:18.642
- The take care.
- Thanks

01:06:06.433 --> 01:06:07.142
Angie.

01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:10.850
Do you promise to God
your family and you.?

01:06:13.183 --> 01:06:14.225
What thoughts will be pure
shares until the day you married?

01:06:14.267 --> 01:06:17.517
What will you be pure of thought and
shares until the day you married?

01:06:45.308 --> 01:06:50.267
You are surrounded by green islands.

01:06:52.892 --> 01:06:58.600
Your breasts are like twin ponies

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:00.767
That's OK

01:07:02.558 --> 01:07:04.267
No poetic look like a man.

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:10.433
Many men are not
they seem. As your pastor.

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:15.183
Are you cheating, right?

01:07:16.308 --> 01:07:20.558
I chased him constantly until
Last night I made a very attractive offer.

01:07:21.933 --> 01:07:23.725
And still nothing ..

01:07:24.433 --> 01:07:26.350
Why do it?

01:07:31.475 --> 01:07:34.267
That's the saddest thing I've heard.

01:07:34.892 --> 01:07:35.350
I know

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:38.517
You do not deserve that kind of
torment. You're a good man

01:07:39.725 --> 01:07:40.392
It's a cruel world.

01:07:42.017 --> 01:07:43.850
A banquet ... two oranges.

01:07:47.725 --> 01:07:48.308
A knife

01:07:49.933 --> 01:07:50.767
The sun ..

01:08:29.308 --> 01:08:34.308
Hey! Time to sleep.
Bring your Bible.

01:08:56.975 --> 01:08:58.058
God.

01:09:04.267 --> 01:09:04.767
Help me.

01:09:08.183 --> 01:09:10.850
Make it stop

01:09:23.475 --> 01:09:24.725
Yes.

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:41.100
I've searched everywhere.

01:10:49.683 --> 01:10:50.267
What do you do?

01:10:53.767 --> 01:10:57.225
I want to say, that all are
Welcome to the 3rd millennium algesia.

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:01.808
As a welcome to the planet

01:11:02.683 --> 01:11:05.850
Which was created just for you

01:11:06.642 --> 01:11:08.100
Shut up!

01:11:18.933 --> 01:11:19.475
Hello?

01:11:20.267 --> 01:11:23.975
Hi friend. I think
it's time to talk.

01:11:25.558 --> 01:11:27.308
I have something I want to show you.

01:11:28.892 --> 01:11:30.142
Anywhere you want, and when
I'm ready anytime.

01:11:33.225 --> 01:11:33.725
Anywhere you want, and when
I'm ready anytime.

01:11:34.225 --> 01:11:36.142
See you in the city of hills.

01:11:37.142 --> 01:11:37.767
Solo.

01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:39.850
You see my face.

01:12:53.308 --> 01:12:54.350
Beware.

01:13:12.683 --> 01:13:13.933
Who are you? How did you get?

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:20.767
Christ! I'm here to
speak the word of the Lord

01:13:21.975 --> 01:13:23.225
It can not be here
Lord will be angry a lot

01:13:26.475 --> 01:13:27.433
You sure?
-You must leave now.

01:13:27.892 --> 01:13:29.558
Out!

01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:53.600
Is this Mexico?

01:13:59.308 --> 01:14:00.058
-Gwen?

01:14:01.558 --> 01:14:02.850
No, I'm fine.

01:14:04.392 --> 01:14:05.600
I know, thank God.

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:07.767
I have proof.

01:14:09.142 --> 01:14:10.517
From what we discussed yesterday.

01:14:11.308 --> 01:14:12.183
-Carl're dreaming again?

01:14:12.725 --> 01:14:14.183
- What?
- No more dreams, Carl

01:14:14.892 --> 01:14:18.017
I have it on DVD
you see it yourself.

01:14:18.683 --> 01:14:19.933
I'll call Jerry. Dan will love!

01:14:20.892 --> 01:14:22.142
No! You should not call it.

01:14:24.183 --> 01:14:26.100
Under no circumstances will call him.

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:29.017
I've called police wing and are on track.

01:14:30.892 --> 01:14:31.683
Gwen.

01:14:34.058 --> 01:14:34.558
-Gwen?

01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:50.392
There have been a twist in the
history professor at the University ..

01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:53.350
Professor Baylock, is awake. and says
it was not a suicide, but an accidental shooting.

01:14:57.933 --> 01:14:59.183
I feel good, health. And many
Thanks to these professionals.

01:14:59.225 --> 01:15:03.017
I feel good, health. And many
Thanks to these professionals.

01:15:03.725 --> 01:15:04.642
It's good to be back.

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:06.517
And will not believe who is accusing ...
Find out after the commercials.

01:15:06.558 --> 01:15:08.683
And will not believe who is accusing ...
Find out after the commercials.

01:15:11.808 --> 01:15:14.058
- Carl Vandemeer?.
- Thank God.

01:15:40.475 --> 01:15:41.725
-Unhappy
-Watch your language.

01:15:43.475 --> 01:15:45.933
Hello, brother. I brought the sandwich.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:16:01.725
Jerry, I'm Gwen, again wanted
make sure you were with Carl ..

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.267
Yes. Call me.

01:16:06.267 --> 01:16:07.808
- Mom?
- Yes?

01:16:09.808 --> 01:16:14.100
- Carl come home?
- If at any time

01:16:14.933 --> 01:16:16.017
I want to know what is happening.

01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:22.267
I'll tell you.

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.767
I was thinking about throwing a party today.

01:16:29.767 --> 01:16:30.475
It will be great.

01:16:32.017 --> 01:16:33.225
Girls ...

01:16:34.558 --> 01:16:35.267
'Hi Grandpa.
'Hello.

01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:37.017
Hi honey

01:16:41.392 --> 01:16:42.433
Where is it?

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.933
Honey .. Do we give a minute?

01:16:45.725 --> 01:16:46.225
Sure.

01:16:50.725 --> 01:16:53.892
It is still delirious,
but it is alive.

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:55.892
That is what matters

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.850
Just pray that Jerry
reach it first

01:16:59.558 --> 01:17:00.808
Is Jerry Habson? I thought we
agreed to call the police.

01:17:04.892 --> 01:17:05.558
Can not remember who said Dan?

01:17:06.975 --> 01:17:08.183
-Suicide by cop?

01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:15.392
I do not think Gwen give us
was telling the truth.

01:17:21.058 --> 01:17:22.308
Jerry, this is not right.

01:17:27.767 --> 01:17:29.017
He's crazy.

01:17:29.892 --> 01:17:31.183
The teacher is awake, Jerry
he will tell everything.

01:17:34.517 --> 01:17:35.808
Explain how you said.

01:17:37.433 --> 01:17:38.600
And you, you're supposed to police!

01:17:42.642 --> 01:17:43.892
Hey! I can be the display.

01:17:45.517 --> 01:17:46.767
Look at this. I have it on this DVD

01:17:48.642 --> 01:17:50.433
It has it all recorded, so
can see with their own eyes.

01:17:52.058 --> 01:17:55.308
Deception always the case, Carl

01:17:55.767 --> 01:17:58.892
I took you to a hospital, Jerry! Why?

01:17:59.767 --> 01:18:01.100
I think we turned left

01:18:17.725 --> 01:18:20.142
Remember when as
classes spoke of forgiveness?

01:18:21.975 --> 01:18:24.517
.. God and Jesus, and a prostitute ..

01:18:26.058 --> 01:18:30.142
And those who would blame her for adultery.

01:18:31.475 --> 01:18:32.725
- For God's sake, shit!
- I told you to watch your language!

01:18:32.767 --> 01:18:34.267
- For God's sake, shit!
- I told you to watch your language!

01:18:34.767 --> 01:18:35.558
Sorry.

01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:39.600
And Jesus said do not judge .. what ..

01:18:43.267 --> 01:18:44.058
Shut up!

01:18:46.142 --> 01:18:47.975
-Give me your lighter.
-I do not smoke.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:49.767
Matches -?

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.850
No. Gwen made me leave
a year ago, remember?

01:19:00.433 --> 01:19:01.683
- Give me the gun.
- Why?

01:19:02.975 --> 01:19:04.225
-The stun gun.
- Are you going to electrocute?

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:06.933
Dame!

01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:08.892
Why do this Jerry?

01:19:10.183 --> 01:19:13.017
They took Jesus and
with him profess ...

01:19:14.933 --> 01:19:19.308
- For the love of God.
- I'm sorry, Carl. Really.

01:19:20.392 --> 01:19:23.600
- This is hard for me
- Let's forget it, Jerry

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:25.600
You are being controlled by evil!

01:19:26.267 --> 01:19:29.558
When facing evil, not
no choice. You have to destroy it.

01:19:32.433 --> 01:19:33.267
Does this insurance?

01:19:34.142 --> 01:19:35.017
Give me that!

01:19:36.392 --> 01:19:37.725
- Watch the damn thing!
- The language!

01:20:55.433 --> 01:20:56.725
I'm glad you came to visit

01:20:57.642 --> 01:20:59.017
The city where
dreams will come true

01:21:11.058 --> 01:21:14.808
Yes. a good home,
for you and your flock.

01:21:15.142 --> 01:21:16.392
We want the same thing, Daniel.
Like I said I'm your friend.

01:21:16.433 --> 01:21:19.975
We want the same thing, Daniel.
Like I said I'm your friend.

01:21:21.517 --> 01:21:23.100
What you want from me?

01:21:24.308 --> 01:21:27.142
Friends? You have nothing to do here.

01:21:29.808 --> 01:21:30.808
Yes.

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:39.433
You will see. I want to help
to create this beautiful place.

01:21:39.975 --> 01:21:41.975
I want to be involved.

01:21:42.808 --> 01:21:43.392
Never.

01:21:45.642 --> 01:21:48.142
This city exists for the sole
order to stay away.

01:21:48.183 --> 01:21:51.100
This city exists for the sole
order to stay away.

01:21:53.558 --> 01:21:54.767
It breaks my heart, Daniel.

01:21:58.808 --> 01:22:00.058
Maybe this will help convince

01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:49.142
You, vile creature.

01:22:49.975 --> 01:22:51.850
Daniel, my sincere apologies.

01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:53.683
It seems our friend Carl.

01:22:54.142 --> 01:22:55.392
In Jesus' name, I demand
come out of this place!

01:22:58.933 --> 01:23:00.183
No more stop me with your sins!

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:01.642
No more stop me with your sins!

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:03.350
'You need to calm down, Daniel.
-No. I am a servant of God!

01:23:07.392 --> 01:23:12.933
- And I command you to shut up!
- Do not know what ..

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:14.225
Yo ..

01:23:14.850 --> 01:23:17.308
curse you!

01:23:18.517 --> 01:23:19.517
Out!

01:23:24.475 --> 01:23:24.975
God.

01:23:43.142 --> 01:23:43.975
Shit

01:23:46.808 --> 01:23:59.142
Satan, you may have my body,
but never have my soul

01:24:51.892 --> 01:24:57.392
"The damage of temptation. And
the reward is obedience. "

01:24:58.725 --> 01:25:01.267
"This is the end of chapter 2"
