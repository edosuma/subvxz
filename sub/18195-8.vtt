Adam and Rachel,

00:24.640 --> 00:28.599
here follows a wedding video diary
of your special day.

00:29.640 --> 00:31.437
Watch and enj...

00:37.160 --> 00:39.310
Righty-o. Ready when you are.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.790
Oooh, hang on a minute. Olivia's just
been sick.

00:46.960 --> 00:47.915
<i>And...action!</i>

00:48.000 --> 00:49.911
Put the gun down, will you?

00:50.000 --> 00:53.788
Josh, you're being really tiresome.
Put the gun down.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.791
<i>Put the gun down!</i>

01:02.120 --> 01:05.271
Couple of minutes, Pete. Couple of minutes.

01:07.320 --> 01:09.231
<i>Ready? Go.</i>

01:09.320 --> 01:12.437
Adam and Rachel, this will give
you some idea

01:12.520 --> 01:14.750
of what family life will be like.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.195
Except, of course, they can't have children.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.518
Er, sorry, can we rewind?

01:25.800 --> 01:27.870
I don't know about this, Pete.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.110
Come on, everybody's doing it.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.156
Right. Recording.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.556
Go.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.953
I got the number for the divorce lawyer.

01:38.040 --> 01:42.079
Oh, no!
Look, a message for the newlyweds. Yes?

01:43.120 --> 01:45.031
All right.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.076
<i>And go.</i>

01:50.000 --> 01:51.956
Really good luck.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.556
Will that do?

02:00.560 --> 02:02.516
<i>Oh, forget it!</i>

02:03.640 --> 02:05.153
I can never sleep when I'm excited.

02:05.240 --> 02:09.199
You should do what I do. - Didn't work.
I've never been married before.

02:10.039 --> 02:12.110
There is one nagging concern.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.351
Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Are you recording this?

02:15.440 --> 02:17.351
I'm doing the whole day.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.352
Forget it!
- Hang on. I'll be discreet.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.154
Which is spelt...
- Two Es and a T.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.674
Dating a teacher's doing you good.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.558
OK, my one nagging concern is this.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.593
Your wedding day is meant to be the
happiest day of your life - or one of them.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.989
What if it's not? What if
you're at the altar

02:36.080 --> 02:38.674
and you think, ''I could be
happier than this''?

02:38.760 --> 02:40.671
Won't happen.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.513
You're not getting married in a church.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.556
Why shouldn't it be happy?

02:45.640 --> 02:47.835
How did you feel on your wedding day?

02:48.920 --> 02:50.148
Hung over.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.595
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.752
Apart from that, you know, happy.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.231
Ecstatically happy.

02:59.320 --> 03:03.074
Hey, no tears.
If you start blubbing, I'm gonna have to.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.116
I'm sorry.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.160
I just don't want it to be a let-down.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.356
Are you having that sausage?

03:13.880 --> 03:15.791
You'll have a lovely time.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.075
Rach, the caterers are here.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.071
<i>That's the good news.</i>

03:20.160 --> 03:22.754
Jenny's still not here. Oi!

03:22.840 --> 03:24.592
Isn't it a bit early to be doing that?

03:24.680 --> 03:26.830
Yes! Oh, Karen, come here.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.559
Come and tell me something

03:29.640 --> 03:31.596
to take my mind off things.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.475
Do you think it's at all possible
that David might be having an affair?

03:37.360 --> 03:40.636
David's about as likely to have an affair
as the Pope.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.713
Women do find him attractive, you know.
David, I mean.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.711
David?

03:46.800 --> 03:50.554
No! No. He's absolutely devoted
to you and the children.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.392
No, David is...a husband and a father.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.198
He's not a...
- Man?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.236
..adulterer.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.711
Why, do you think he might be?

04:04.800 --> 04:08.315
Oh, I don't know. I'm probably
being ridiculous.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.356
Yeah, you are.

04:10.440 --> 04:13.796
Thanks, though. For a moment there
you did actually take my mind off it.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.199
Good.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.430
<i>Adam, love, what are you doing?</i>

04:17.519 --> 04:20.875
Oh, come on! That's Mummy's lipsticks.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.151
You look like a clown.

04:26.240 --> 04:30.392
Come on. Listen, go and get some toys
to take to your nan's.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.233
Not your Darth Maul mask. It scares her.

04:33.320 --> 04:37.598
All right, I'm coming! I'm coming.
I'm coming.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.319
Oh, it's you.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.278
Just picking up some stuff. Hiya, tiger.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.071
Go on. Go and get your toys.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.309
I'm bringing these back.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.914
Great. Saves me changing the locks.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.356
Weren't you coming when we were out?
- You're supposed to be out.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.159
Help yourself. Don't steal anything.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.030
Oh! God, doesn't time drag?

05:09.080 --> 05:12.675
What? Waiting for your wedding?
- It's like waiting to take a driving test.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.512
I failed mine first time.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.591
Driving test.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.717
Think you'll ever do it again?
- What? My driving test?

05:20.800 --> 05:21.835
No.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.990
Well, we're not divorced yet.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.559
I can't see it happening again.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.079
What about Emma?

05:29.120 --> 05:30.872
Emma?

05:31.920 --> 05:33.558
Wow, this looks delicious!

05:33.640 --> 05:36.074
It's thrown together. I had
detention after school.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.310
Oh, aye? What have you been up to?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.595
No, I was taking it. Oh...I see.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.673
Emma's just been made head of careers.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.671
Maybe she can get you one!

05:46.760 --> 05:48.671
<i>She's a lovely girl.</i>

05:48.760 --> 05:51.672
Who's got the garlic bread?
- Who do you think?

05:51.760 --> 05:54.672
Oh, fatty fathead!
- Oh! Cheeky monkey!

05:54.760 --> 05:59.038
Look, anchovies! I don't want anchovies.
- Oh, I'll have them.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.554
Oh, no! No, no, I'm not kissing you.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.756
Especially not with tongues.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.191
She's a lovely girl.
- Jenny?

06:07.280 --> 06:08.713
Emma.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.711
Yeah, Emma.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.473
That reminds me. I must give her a call.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.471
Aw, that's sweet.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.235
Right, first drink of the day.
Amaretto or Schnapps?

06:19.320 --> 06:21.276
Schnapps!

06:29.360 --> 06:31.715
Right, well, that's everything.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.156
Bob.com logging off.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.111
Going somewhere?

06:38.200 --> 06:43.991
Yeah, for the 79th time,
Adam and Rachel's wedding. I told you.

06:44.080 --> 06:46.275
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.554
What are you sorry about?

06:47.640 --> 06:49.710
Rachel. She deserves better.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.553
Than Adam?
How the hell would you know?

06:52.640 --> 06:55.154
The fact that they made me unwelcome

06:55.240 --> 06:58.391
had nothing to do with why
we didn't work out?

06:59.520 --> 07:03.115
No, no. I think that's just a
convenient excuse.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.716
You won't have a word said against them.
- What's to say? My friends are reliable.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.759
Look it up in a dictionary. First sign of
trouble, you won't see them sneaking out!

07:11.840 --> 07:15.594
You know nothing about your friends!
- I know...

07:15.680 --> 07:18.672
I know they're worth more than you are,
Mr Millionaire.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.910
Yeah, right.
- They're not hypocrites.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.513
Who needs a dictionary now?

07:22.600 --> 07:23.874
Shut up.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.951
You don't know what it means.
- Whatever!

07:26.040 --> 07:29.589
Oh, yeah? Ask David, Mr Family Man,
cheating on his wife!

07:29.680 --> 07:32.069
What are you talking about?

07:34.440 --> 07:36.670
We would never have fitted
our wedding in here.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.432
Yeah, 300 of our closest friends.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.954
Most of whom we haven't seen since.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.508
Can I have a box from the kitchen?
- I'll go.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.676
We appreciate this so much.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.275
We're just so happy
you two are finally getting it together.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.510
You recommend marriage, then?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.511
Absolutely.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.556
David, thank you!

07:59.440 --> 08:03.513
You'll never guess what Karen
told me earlier. - What?

08:03.600 --> 08:07.309
Rachel, your father's here.
He says he wants a word.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.356
OK.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.717
I didn't expect to see you until
the registry office.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.109
We wouldn't have a chance to talk.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.476
Why don't you go upstairs?
It's private there.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.516
No, here's fine.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.115
Your mum sends her love.
She can't wait to see you.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.155
I can't wait to see her.

08:37.960 --> 08:41.669
We're disappointed it's not in church,
but that's your decision.

08:42.799 --> 08:45.030
Is that what you came here to say?

08:45.120 --> 08:47.111
We've had our differences,

08:47.200 --> 08:50.556
but all said and done, you're still
my daughter.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.393
The eldest and the first to get married.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.436
I'd like to give you away.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.475
I wanted Mum to be here today.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.471
That's why you're invited.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.516
And that's the only reason.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.950
David? You've agreed to give me away,
haven't you?

09:09.080 --> 09:11.036
I'm sorry?

09:12.280 --> 09:14.236
How long now?

09:15.440 --> 09:16.350
45 minutes.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.351
Pfff! What?!

09:21.440 --> 09:23.351
W-What? Why didn't you say?

09:23.440 --> 09:26.193
We're not dressed. The car will be here.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.236
Till Grandstand.

09:30.840 --> 09:34.833
Yeah, and we've got enough time
for all of Football Focus

09:34.920 --> 09:36.876
and half a horse race.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.671
Can I ask you something?

09:40.760 --> 09:42.751
Mm-hm.
- In your capacity as best man.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.513
If it's about the speech, don't worry.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.990
No, say what you want.
It's about masturbation.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.675
When you were with Jenny,
you stll used to wank, yeah?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.990
Of course I did. Don't you?

09:57.080 --> 10:00.959
Yeah, well, all men do.
And anyway, I'm Presbyterian.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.109
Did Jenny?

10:02.200 --> 10:05.192
What? Go walkabout in the bush down under?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.754
Well, I'm sure she did before we met.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.956
But after that um...

10:12.040 --> 10:14.998
You're worried about Rachel, aren't you?

10:15.080 --> 10:17.674
You're worried you're not pushing
the right buttons.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.478
Don't be ridiculous. No.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.471
It's just the other day...

10:29.120 --> 10:30.235
I don't mind.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.311
It just seems odd, doesn't it?

10:32.400 --> 10:35.915
When I'm in the house,
just before we get married.

10:37.560 --> 10:42.714
You didn't confront her about it, did you?
- What? Ask her? Er... ha, ha!

10:44.080 --> 10:46.435
It's a difficult one, this. Yeah.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.116
I feel the need to know.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.999
I can always ask Jenny, if you like.

10:55.080 --> 10:58.789
What, if Rachel goes walkabout
in the bush down under?

11:04.720 --> 11:08.110
Well, OK. But remember how to
spell ''discreet''.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.990
Rachel's put me in a very difficult position.
- Well, what did you say?

11:12.080 --> 11:14.958
What could I say? Yes.
- What, in front of her father?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.996
Clearly she wanted me to.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.070
What went on between them anyway?
- Oh, David, he's not a very nice man.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.554
He's a bigot and a drinker.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.552
Oh, yeah?
- No, not like my mother.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.154
Quite seriously. He used to hit
Rachel's mum.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.918
God, to think I shook his hand.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.357
So I wouldn't feel too badly
about taking his place, darling.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.872
Jenny.
- Hi, Karen.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.474
Hi, Jenny.
- David.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.959
Hello!

11:48.880 --> 11:51.952
Come on! The car'll be here in five minutes.

11:54.120 --> 11:57.271
What?
- It's not fancy dress, you know.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.716
What?
- Lounge suits. It said so on the invite.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.314
Where?
- Small print at the bottom.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.234
I never read the small print. Oh, bloody
hell. I haven't brought a suit.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.629
Oh, half the men will be dressed like that.

12:09.720 --> 12:13.998
It might come in handy if we want
to put something on top of the cake.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.674
What?

12:20.720 --> 12:22.676
Excuse me.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.509
Oooh! I am not at all sure about this dress.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.757
Maybe I should change.
Rach, do you think I should change?

12:31.840 --> 12:33.831
If it'd make you feel better.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.832
Do you hate it?
- No, I don't.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.672
Oh! I'm going to change.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.716
She's more on edge than I am.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.236
She may have good reason to be.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.599
Listen.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.676
David's having an affair.

12:57.200 --> 13:01.352
We've already been through that one.
- Oh, my God, does she know?

13:03.720 --> 13:06.314
You're joking.
- No.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.595
Robert saw them.

13:09.680 --> 13:13.229
David was in a restaurant
with that Jessica woman.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.356
All lovey-dovey and that.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.628
Jessica?
- Yeah.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.631
Oh, my God.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.154
She thought he was up to something.

13:23.240 --> 13:26.198
I just told her she was being ridiculous.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.714
Shit! The car's here.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.915
Are you all right?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.228
Yeah.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.276
Nervous.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.352
Come on, mate. It's just nerves.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.595
It's not nerves. It's those bloody sausages.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.673
I had them as well.
- Yeah, well, you only had one.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.513
Besides, the abuse your body has taken
over the years...

13:47.600 --> 13:49.397
So, is the car here yet?
- No.

13:49.480 --> 13:53.268
Well, have you rung it? - I don't know
what firm it is. Jenny organised it.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.796
Jenny organised the girls' car.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.313
You were supposed to do ours.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.197
Are you sure?

14:00.280 --> 14:01.793
Right, I'll do the taxis.

14:02.840 --> 14:06.992
Oh, hey! I don't want a beaten-up old car.
I want to arrive in style.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.275
You know - limo, Cadillac?

14:09.360 --> 14:11.271
Taxi's fine by me.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.874
OK, I'll do the girls' transport.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.997
Best man can do the boys'.
All right, Pete?

14:17.080 --> 14:20.993
Do these things have a sell-by date?
- I don't know. Check the small print.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.592
Start phoning cab firms.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.797
Right. Do you still want a limo?
- I just want a lift!

14:29.880 --> 14:31.472
Where are you going?
- The loo.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.034
Oh, sorry.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.231
I don't know much about flowers,
but these are stupendous.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.311
David! I want a word with you.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.311
Rach, we've got to go.

14:48.400 --> 14:52.029
Are you still here? Come on!
- Don't worry. I'll be there ahead of you.

14:52.120 --> 14:56.033
Marsden.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.759
I've tried the local cab firms and...

14:58.840 --> 15:01.957
they can't do anything in under
half an hour.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.112
Well, haven't you got a car?
- No, and Rachel's took theirs.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.749
Well, no, I'm sorry.
The Merc's at the mechanic's.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.274
Well, German engineering for you.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.510
Yeah. How are you going to get there?

15:14.560 --> 15:16.790
Look, um...you swing by here

15:17.680 --> 15:21.150
and I'll keep trying the local firms.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.196
OK.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.715
Is everything all right?

15:35.800 --> 15:37.199
Well, the weather's holding.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.191
Adam's not here yet.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.349
Or the best man.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.032
Or my husband.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.713
Well, if you'd like me to give you away...

15:45.800 --> 15:48.837
Dad, without a groom
there's very little point, is there?

15:51.040 --> 15:54.635
They'll just be stuck in traffic.
- Unless he's having second thoughts!

15:54.720 --> 15:56.950
Either way, Rach, you should stay
out of sight.

15:57.040 --> 16:01.272
He shouldn't see you before the ceremony.
- Mum, hold these. Jen, come with me.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.788
Do you think we should tell Karen?
- Oh, God! I don't think I could.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.791
Jenny, she told you.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.791
Yes, she did.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.792
Ho-ly shite! Ho-ly shite!

16:17.880 --> 16:20.440
Oh, God!

16:26.360 --> 16:28.316
OK, David's here.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.356
Good luck, man.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.119
Time to get married.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.156
Yeah.

16:45.560 --> 16:46.675
Still no sign.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.638
Jenny and I are having a private word.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.439
Oh, my God. It's about my dress, isn't it?

16:52.520 --> 16:55.318
You what?
- Is it because it's see-through?

16:55.400 --> 16:57.868
No, it is not about your dress! Now, go on!

17:01.600 --> 17:04.672
Oh, God!
- Hey, do you girls fancy a brew?

17:21.200 --> 17:23.953
It's certainly stylish. What kept you?

17:24.040 --> 17:27.669
Best man tried to poison me,
then he took me hostage.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.513
Where is he?
- On his way, hopefully.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.356
<i>Rachel, you're on!</i>

17:40.640 --> 17:43.677
Hi, guys. Hey, John, look. Present for you.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.751
Thank you. Hello, everyone.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.956
Oh! Can you take that, please?

17:48.880 --> 17:51.110
All right, guys? Hi, how are you?

17:51.200 --> 17:53.156
Right, here we are, then.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.277
Wait, wait. I want you two
to go in ahead of us.

17:56.360 --> 17:59.193
We're supposed to follow you.
It's tradition, isn't it?

17:59.280 --> 18:01.430
So's... So's burning witches.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.512
So sod tradition and get up there.
- Come on!

18:07.080 --> 18:09.036
I'll just take this lot off.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.714
You're lucky we were able to wait.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.429
There's no-one after you.
We had a cancellation.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.511
Ah, just like a driving test.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.555
Why did they cancel?

18:19.640 --> 18:23.952
Oh, the divorce hadn't come through yet.
One of them was still married.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.395
Not as strange as you think, mate.

18:31.800 --> 18:36.157
Do you want to wait for your best man?
- Oh, yes... Oh, no. Let's go.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.751
Rachel, you look wonderful.

18:42.840 --> 18:46.071
Here, don't forget your bouquet.
- David, I...

18:46.160 --> 18:50.278
That's our cue. Are you ready?

18:59.560 --> 19:02.950
David, I've got to know.
Are you having an affair?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.151
Who told you that?
- God, David.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.958
Why didn't you just say no?

19:11.160 --> 19:12.798
No?

19:13.840 --> 19:15.876
Can you just give us a minute?

19:21.040 --> 19:22.996
David!

19:31.160 --> 19:34.709
Listen, I...I just made a dreadful mistake.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.952
I don't know what was happening to me.
I had a sort of brainstorm.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.474
This beautiful woman flattered me

19:41.560 --> 19:43.790
and I allowed it to turn my head.

19:43.880 --> 19:48.510
You and Karen are the only advert
for a good marriage that I know!

19:48.600 --> 19:52.275
It's terrific to find out on my wedding day
that it's a complete sham!

19:52.360 --> 19:57.229
It's not a sham! I adore Karen and the children.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt them.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.831
Look, it only happened once.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.718
When I came to my senses,
I put an end to it.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.273
I promise you.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.316
What's happening?

20:09.680 --> 20:12.399
I'll go and check.
- No, it's fine. It's her dress.

20:12.480 --> 20:15.677
The zip's gone, I...I think.
- At least it's not see-through.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.671
Where's the toilet?

20:17.760 --> 20:19.671
Through that door, second on the left.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.671
Great!

20:21.760 --> 20:23.671
Now what?

20:23.760 --> 20:27.116
We did only have the one cancellation,
you know.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.156
Yeah. Er...

20:30.200 --> 20:33.476
OK, should somebody do something, or...

20:33.560 --> 20:35.471
Like what?

20:35.560 --> 20:36.959
I don't know.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.911
Sing a song?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.956
Or a slow hand-clap.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.551
Hi.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.359
Right. Unless there's anything else?

21:09.480 --> 21:11.391
Oh! Sorry.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.391
Sorry. Did I miss anything?

21:13.480 --> 21:15.436
Oh, sorry about that.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.033
This side?
- Yeah.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.076
And...yes.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.111
Hooray!

21:47.760 --> 21:49.876
Thanks.
- Thank you for coming.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.155
And thank you.
- What for?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.879
For being here. Being you.

21:56.080 --> 21:59.595
I had this fear this morning
that when we were standing up there,

21:59.680 --> 22:02.672
I'd be distracted.
I wanted everything to be so perfect.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.352
And?

22:05.400 --> 22:07.356
And then there was you.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.358
I saw you on David's arm
and the world...stopped.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.356
It was just you and me.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.316
Was that how you felt?

22:18.560 --> 22:21.518
What was all that about with you and David?

22:21.600 --> 22:23.716
Nothing. I'll tell you later.

22:30.520 --> 22:34.274
Pete! We didn't think you would make it.
- Oh, neither did I.

22:34.360 --> 22:37.955
There wasn't a cab to be found.
I finally flagged down a car full of nuns.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.270
You got a lift? I figured you ran.

22:40.360 --> 22:44.478
I did. They dropped me at those
lights there. - What, those lights?

22:44.560 --> 22:45.595
Yeah.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.035
You should think about getting fit.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.077
And smile!

22:55.920 --> 22:57.831
What did he say?

22:57.920 --> 22:59.831
Not now!

22:59.920 --> 23:02.718
Oh, dodging the issue. That's typical!

23:04.320 --> 23:07.630
No, he told me everything. We'll talk later.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.276
Smile.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.839
Keep that off.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.876
Off or on? Make your mind up!

23:27.080 --> 23:29.799
Move in closer together.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.236
A kiss?

23:37.760 --> 23:40.149
Hi. Thanks for coming.
- You look wonderful.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.071
Thank you.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.111
Congratulations, darling.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.713
I'm so happy for you.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.716
Thanks, Mum.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.157
OK, everyone. The reception is at our house.

23:54.240 --> 23:57.357
The address is on the back
of the invitation.

23:57.440 --> 24:00.000
So if you'd make your way over there.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.836
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

24:04.920 --> 24:07.115
Can anyone give me a lift?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.238
Hello.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.437
Karen, this is fantastic, my darling.
Thank you. - Good. Good.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.671
It's gorgeous.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.832
Put your presents there, on the table.
Thanks very much.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.275
There's fruit juice if you're
pacing yourselves,

24:27.360 --> 24:30.318
and a buffet will be served in the marquee.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.311
Adam, how's things?

24:36.360 --> 24:38.271
Bye.

24:38.360 --> 24:43.150
Hey, you, Mrs!
What is going on with you and David?

24:43.240 --> 24:46.152
Adam, I can't tell you.
- You said you would.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.151
I know. But I can't.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.711
That's great. We're already
keeping secrets from each other?

24:53.760 --> 24:55.716
All right. Upstairs.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.799
Jessica? Well, you have to hand it to him.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.552
Adam!
- What? Er, oh, yeah.

25:05.640 --> 25:09.030
And Karen doesn't know? Holy shite!

25:09.120 --> 25:11.509
Sorry, there's somebody in here.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.511
It's Jen. Let us in.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.556
Unless you're having sex.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.071
Well? What did he say?

25:21.160 --> 25:22.718
There we go.

25:23.760 --> 25:27.673
Come on. You say good night.
I have to get you in the bath.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.990
I think we have to say good night.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.753
Come on, Joshie. Time for bed.
- OK, you go with Daddy.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.751
Where are Adam and Rachel?

25:34.840 --> 25:38.469
Probably gone to consummate the marriage.
- With Jenny?

25:39.520 --> 25:41.476
Night, darling.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.434
I just want to get back to my wedding.

25:44.520 --> 25:47.398
Are we going to tell her?
- Do we have to discuss this now?

25:47.480 --> 25:50.313
If it's over, Karen does not need to know.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.834
Karen does not need to know what?

25:52.920 --> 25:54.319
Lock the door.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.358
Turn that bloody camera off.
- I can't. It's cinema verite!

25:57.440 --> 25:58.668
Off!

26:02.160 --> 26:04.071
So...

26:04.160 --> 26:06.116
What gives?

26:07.160 --> 26:11.278
David's having an affair.
- Yeah, with Jessica. It's been going on for ages.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.920
You know?
- Of course. I rumbled him in Ireland.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.072
And you didn't say anything?
- If anything, I'm discreet!

26:17.160 --> 26:21.073
Honour among adulterers. Lovely!
- So now everyone knows. Except Karen.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.230
And that is how it should stay.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.436
No.
- Yes!

26:25.520 --> 26:27.670
I just want to get back to my wedding.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.479
I'm sorry. We've got to say something.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.196
Tell that one to Tim.

26:37.080 --> 26:40.038
Hi, darling.
- Now Pete's disappeared, as well.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.189
What?

26:41.280 --> 26:43.874
He's probably running
his best man's speech past them.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.916
Yeah. I hope you're right.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.594
<i>We're her friends. We have to interfere.</i>

26:50.680 --> 26:54.150
This is really none of our business.
- David has made it our business.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.959
Uh-uh. Your boyfriend has.
- He's my ex, thank you!

26:57.040 --> 26:59.713
I'm single, too, you know.
- Since when?

26:59.800 --> 27:02.234
Can we discuss this another time?

27:02.320 --> 27:03.719
Karen has got the right to know.

27:03.800 --> 27:08.954
It wasn't an affair. They only did it once.
- I suppose a blow job doesn't count, either.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.231
You are marrying him!

27:12.320 --> 27:14.993
Whatever the wrongs and rights,
it's over. Just let it lie.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.435
Am I the only one with any sense?

27:17.520 --> 27:19.317
Shh! Somebody's coming.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.072
<i>Won't be a minute.</i>

27:21.160 --> 27:23.071
Rachel, is that you?

27:23.160 --> 27:27.676
Yes, Mum.
- Rachel, I need to come in. Now.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.558
We won't be a minute - I won't be a minute.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.876
Well, it's all yours, Mum.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.035
There you are. Is anything wrong?

27:46.080 --> 27:49.516
No, everything's just hunky-dory.
- Interesting.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.319
I think we're about ready for the cake.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.069
Rachel. What's going on?

27:56.160 --> 27:58.071
David, it's my wedding day.

27:58.160 --> 28:01.675
If you don't mind,
I'd like to enjoy it for just one moment!

28:01.760 --> 28:05.036
Where's the loo, David?
- It's just upstairs.

28:09.600 --> 28:14.355
I've spent weeks trying to think
of the right thing to say about her.

28:14.440 --> 28:17.910
Had I been a great mathematician,
or physicist, say,

28:18.960 --> 28:24.080
I might have found the exact formula
that explains the wonder of Rachel.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.674
But I was rubbish at those subjects.

28:26.760 --> 28:29.069
Or if I'd been a star at languages,

28:29.160 --> 28:32.709
maybe I could have come up
with the words of passion

28:32.800 --> 28:35.951
that illustrate just what she does to me.

28:36.040 --> 28:39.350
But, ''Que hay en la bolsa?''
''What is in the shopping bag?''

28:40.560 --> 28:42.551
doesn't quite hit the mark.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.551
English was my forte.

28:44.640 --> 28:48.713
Even then, nothing I come up with
comes close to describing

28:48.800 --> 28:53.669
how I feel about the girl that took
my breath away the minute I met her.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.999
With Rachel, I can't even get the words
in the right order.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.950
So, in closing,

29:04.040 --> 29:07.953
I'd just like to thank you all for being here
to share this happy day with us.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.115
And to my wife...

29:19.440 --> 29:21.510
..I would say,

29:21.600 --> 29:23.591
Williams Rachel,

29:24.440 --> 29:26.396
you I love.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.711
OK, OK, OK.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.711
The cake!

29:51.640 --> 29:54.074
Are you nervous about your speech?

29:54.160 --> 29:57.197
No! Well, no more than at our wedding.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.191
Oh, my God!

29:59.280 --> 30:03.273
Just start with a good joke or something.
You'll be fine.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.476
Yeah, yeah, great. Good idea.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.877
Do you know any?
- Oh, shut up.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.038
Rachel, please, I need to talk to you.
- David!

30:19.080 --> 30:21.036
OK. In the hallway.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.637
Sorry I've been slow
sending them divorce papers back.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.358
I know you want to get on with it.

30:26.440 --> 30:30.353
Let's not talk about divorce today?
Yeah? - Yeah.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.470
Everyone knows, don't they?

30:35.120 --> 30:36.758
Everyone except Karen.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.756
Oh, God.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.357
I've destroyed my marriage.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.356
Oh, for God's sake, David.

30:47.720 --> 30:51.349
I'm sorry about you and whatshername.
Um... Emma.

30:51.440 --> 30:53.158
I thought it was going really well.

30:53.240 --> 30:56.596
Well, it was. But I had to finish it
this morning.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.875
It wasn't working.
She was way out of my league.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.871
Thanks very much.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.757
Oh, I didn't mean...

31:03.800 --> 31:05.916
You're not such a bad catch, Pete.

31:06.960 --> 31:10.316
OK, everybody, while they're
cutting the cake,

31:10.400 --> 31:12.755
I'd like to call upon the best man.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.956
Hold on. Where's Rachel?

31:17.880 --> 31:21.077
I don't think anyone's going to
say anything,

31:21.160 --> 31:23.355
although I can't be sure about Jenny.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.431
It doesn't matter.

31:26.520 --> 31:30.069
You all know...and I know that you know.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.671
Rach, come on. Pete's about to do
his speech.

31:35.720 --> 31:36.755
Are you all right?

31:37.960 --> 31:39.075
Karen?

31:39.160 --> 31:41.116
What?

31:43.880 --> 31:45.836
I want you to sit down.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.277
Excuse me.
Folks, can I have your attention, please?

31:55.360 --> 32:00.559
Most grooms thank their best man
for getting him to the church on time.

32:00.640 --> 32:03.996
Thanks to mine, I nearly didn't get there at all.
- Come here.

32:04.080 --> 32:07.595
So rest assured that whatever he says
about me is nothing

32:07.680 --> 32:09.989
compared to what
I was saying about him earlier.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.548
He is an idiot.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.551
But he's my idiot.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.837
Ladies and gentlemen, my best man,
the one, the only Pete Gifford!

32:26.680 --> 32:28.875
<i>Shit!</i>

32:30.320 --> 32:33.232
Listen to that! Heckled before
I've even started!

32:33.320 --> 32:37.677
I will not allow this to interfere
with Adam and Rachel's day.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.029
You don't want to discuss it now?
- Upstairs!

32:54.640 --> 32:58.792
Now, Adam thinks he knows
all there is to know about Rachel.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.348
And there's a great deal to know.

33:01.440 --> 33:05.479
I wasn't going to mention it,
but earlier, Adam said to me

33:05.600 --> 33:08.717
that I can say anything I like.
I'm delighted.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.633
You said what?
- He promised to be discreet.

33:11.800 --> 33:14.234
Now, for example, Adam was worried

33:14.320 --> 33:17.551
he might not be man enough for Rachel.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.598
Oh, my God, not the missing bollock!

33:21.640 --> 33:25.030
And I'm not referring
to just the one testicle he has remaining,

33:27.000 --> 33:31.232
but his apparent inability to satisfy
her sexually,

33:31.320 --> 33:33.550
ladies and gentlemen. Oh, yes.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.359
You see, the other week,
Adam caught Rachel upstairs...

33:36.440 --> 33:39.910
How shall I put this? Um...on the bed,

33:40.000 --> 33:41.956
amusing herself.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.798
I think you know what I mean. Ooh, yeah.

33:49.440 --> 33:52.432
Well, Adam, you'll be relieved
to know, mate,

33:52.520 --> 33:56.752
that the reason Rachel was writhing on
the bed with her hands fiddling in her crotch

33:56.840 --> 34:01.356
was her jeans were too tight
and she couldn't get the zip up.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.590
So that's what it was all about.

34:03.680 --> 34:07.309
But my sources do tell me
that she's still not afraid

34:07.400 --> 34:10.391
to play with the one she loves
now and again.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.755
Regularly. Wa-hey!

34:12.840 --> 34:14.795
What on earth is he on about?

34:16.639 --> 34:19.279
David should have been my best man.

34:21.440 --> 34:24.112
How could you...

34:25.159 --> 34:27.036
..treat me with so little respect?

34:27.120 --> 34:30.829
Karen... - Has the last eight years
meant nothing to you?

34:30.920 --> 34:31.830
Of course they...

34:31.920 --> 34:35.879
You're prepared to throw it all away
on some sordid little affair!

34:36.920 --> 34:39.150
Oh, my God. She was in this house!

34:40.840 --> 34:43.559
Karen, It wasn't here...and it was
just the once.

34:43.639 --> 34:45.790
I don't care!

34:45.880 --> 34:48.678
I don't care about the details. It happened!

34:48.760 --> 34:50.670
You let it happen!

34:50.760 --> 34:52.716
That's all I need to know.

34:55.159 --> 34:59.597
Jesus! It is so unoriginal.

35:00.480 --> 35:04.109
Just like every other pathetic,
middle-aged man

35:04.200 --> 35:06.714
who regards his wife with contempt!

35:06.800 --> 35:10.315
I do not regard you with contempt!
- Well, I...do...you!

35:12.840 --> 35:16.958
So, yes. Adam Williams finally gets married.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.634
There's a first time for everything.

35:19.720 --> 35:22.188
But second time for Rachel.

35:22.280 --> 35:23.474
I bet you didn't know that.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.471
Oh, shit!

35:25.560 --> 35:28.916
Not that it lasted long. Well, it did,
actually.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.911
But not until the divorce.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.073
That was when Adam found out,
when they moved in together.

35:35.160 --> 35:38.436
Then husband No.1 moved in, as well.
There was three of them together.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.272
Oh, shit.

35:40.360 --> 35:42.271
It was like a French film.

35:42.360 --> 35:45.158
Still, you have to laugh, don't you?

35:50.920 --> 35:52.876
Apparently not.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.835
<i>No, Joshie. Joshie!</i>

35:56.920 --> 35:59.480
Mummy, we're pllaying hide and seek.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.276
Why's Daddy sad?

36:04.400 --> 36:08.313
He's not sad.
He's just hurt himself, but he's fine now.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.949
We go back to your room
and I count to ten again, yes?

36:12.040 --> 36:14.395
Sorry, I'll leave you on your own.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.669
It's hard to meet someone
you want to spend your life with.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.591
When you do, make sure you don't blow it.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.396
Because after that, no-one else comes close.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.835
And who wants second best, eh?

36:30.920 --> 36:34.469
Adam and Rachel
have got a better chance than most.

36:35.520 --> 36:42.039
They're clearly meant for each other. Besides,
they can learn from their friends' mistakes.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.714
And now, I'd like to ask you all

36:45.800 --> 36:48.360
to raise a glass to the happy couple,

36:49.600 --> 36:51.158
Adam and Rachel.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.390
<i>Adam and Rachel.</i>

36:56.680 --> 36:59.319
So...

36:59.400 --> 37:00.833
..I'd best pack a bag.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.394
Slip out before anyone notices

37:04.480 --> 37:06.436
and move into a hotel.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.151
No, you won't.

37:09.240 --> 37:12.471
I won't allow that woman to
destroy my family.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.548
I despise you for being so weak.

37:16.640 --> 37:19.313
But I don't want my children to suffer.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.675
You will sleep in the spare room.

37:26.280 --> 37:29.590
So, are you prepared
to give me another chance?

37:31.200 --> 37:33.509
We'll do what lots of people do, David.

37:34.560 --> 37:37.632
Smile in public.
Pretend we have a happy marriage.

37:38.680 --> 37:40.591
But we still can...

37:40.680 --> 37:43.638
...darling.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.035
Oooah. Thank God for that.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.269
Great speech.

37:53.360 --> 37:56.909
Thanks.
Hey, I just about got away with it, though.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.116
When you started on masturbation...

37:59.200 --> 38:02.078
We thought artificial insemination
wasn't too far behind.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.674
I knew there was something I forgot.

38:04.760 --> 38:07.479
Rachel. Can we have a word?

38:08.800 --> 38:10.756
Yep.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.796
Daddy.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.836
Hi. How are you?

38:24.320 --> 38:25.912
Hi. How's everybody's glasses?

38:26.000 --> 38:27.911
He's told her.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.911
Don't say anything, Jenny.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.999
There's plenty of salmon.
Help yourself. Can I top you up?

38:35.080 --> 38:36.991
And then you were divorced?

38:37.080 --> 38:38.069
I'm not now.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.071
Yes. Thank you. Later.

38:40.160 --> 38:43.152
But you know we don't approve of divorce.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.276
Yeah, I do. I just don't know why.

38:45.360 --> 38:48.238
Well, because marriage is for life.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.073
For better or worse?

38:51.160 --> 38:53.594
What kind of impression do
people have of you?

38:53.680 --> 38:55.318
What?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.470
What century are you lliving in?

38:57.560 --> 39:00.677
We don't do things
for appearances any more.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.513
Nobody cares that I married a black man.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.999
Black?

39:05.080 --> 39:08.914
Yes, black. You had a black son-in-law,
Mother. Is that a problem for you?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.752
What about the cultural differences?

39:10.840 --> 39:15.960
He was from Stoke. Have you got
something against people from Stoke?

39:16.040 --> 39:18.474
There's no need
to speak to your mother like that.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.994
There is absolutely every reason!

39:21.080 --> 39:24.152
It's about time we had some bloody honesty.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.150
I was married. I was pregnant.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.390
Didn't know who the father was.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.597
I had an abortion. Adam and I
can't have kids.

39:32.680 --> 39:37.595
Your younger daughter is a lesbian.
That's why she moved to Australia.

39:37.680 --> 39:41.514
Because she can't live the life
she wants to lead in this country.

39:44.600 --> 39:47.273
Right, I think that's about everything.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.271
Now it's your turn.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.476
Is Dad still hitting you, Mum?

39:52.600 --> 39:55.717
Your mum and I
have been married for 32 years.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.998
When you've been together as long,
then maybe you can lecture us.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.991
You know nothing, young lady.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.996
Well, she knows respect.

40:11.040 --> 40:14.430
Ruth, I won't stop in this house
a minute longer. Come on.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.715
They're nice, your parents.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.910
Are you all right?

40:40.000 --> 40:41.956
Yeah.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.589
Do you think I should have bitten my tongue?
- Ah! Do you wish you had?

40:52.880 --> 40:54.836
No, I don't.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.031
No.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.076
Thanks.

41:02.640 --> 41:06.315
Though I don't know
if you should have outed your sister.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.913
Bloody hell.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.394
Oh, my God. What time is it in Sydney?

41:11.480 --> 41:13.436
I thought she was in Alice.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.431
Alice?

41:16.520 --> 41:18.431
Ah, in Alice!

41:18.520 --> 41:20.476
Lesbian humour.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.596
Thanks.

41:32.840 --> 41:34.796
Oh, hi. Luce, it's me.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.791
Yeah, I'm married.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.552
Again.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.672
But listen, that's not why I'm ringing you.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.716
Fancy that.

41:52.400 --> 41:54.197
Yeah.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.435
What is it about weddings, anyway?

41:58.480 --> 42:00.391
Well, we did it after ours.

42:00.480 --> 42:02.436
I should bloody hope so.

42:05.080 --> 42:07.036
Going to stay for brekky?

42:08.720 --> 42:11.757
Well, I thought you had to pick
the nipper up.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.756
We'll do that after.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.677
We?

42:17.760 --> 42:19.716
If you want to.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.836
I know he'd like it.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.276
Yeah. He would, wouldn't he?

42:47.840 --> 42:50.798
Here you are.
- Thank you.

42:54.600 --> 42:57.717
I told Josh
you'd do some colouring with him.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.756
Oh... but...golf.

43:01.920 --> 43:06.277
Sorry. I'll ring the lads and scratch.
And do some colouring.

43:08.680 --> 43:12.275
How did you sleep?
- Fine, thanks. You?

43:12.360 --> 43:15.079
No. The mattress is lumpy.
I'll get a new one.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.628
You might want to decorate, as well.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.513
What?

43:55.560 --> 43:57.516
Nothing.

44:01.520 --> 44:02.669
What?

44:04.440 --> 44:07.432
I was just thinking how beautiful you are.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.316
How lucky I am.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.470
You don't mind that we didn't...

44:15.560 --> 44:17.949
consummate our marriage?

44:18.040 --> 44:19.871
Ohh...

44:19.960 --> 44:21.871
After all that booze,

44:21.960 --> 44:24.474
I don't think I could've managed it.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.959
Anyway, I wanted to save it until
we were feeling fresh.

44:32.280 --> 44:34.236
And how are you feeling now?

44:35.960 --> 44:37.916
Mmmm.

44:40.320 --> 44:42.276
I'm feeling fresh.

44:49.240 --> 44:50.559
Oh, give me one of those.

44:50.640 --> 44:53.757
I must warn you all that this is
just a rough cut.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.990
Oh, aye? Francis Ford Gifford!

44:56.080 --> 44:59.311
And the editing's dodgy
cos I did it from machine to machine.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.550
Oh, just show the bloody thing!

45:01.640 --> 45:04.154
Come on. Are you ready?

45:04.240 --> 45:06.913
Let love begin.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.274
Ah! How did you do that?

45:10.360 --> 45:14.148
That's little Adam's magnetic letters
on the fridge.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.151
<i>No expense spared.</i>

45:16.240 --> 45:18.196
<i>Ooh! Very good!</i>

45:22.960 --> 45:24.916
Who's that?

45:25.000 --> 45:26.956
I don't know her.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.311
It means a great deal to them.

45:36.360 --> 45:39.158
What were you doing?
- What's all this about?

45:40.560 --> 45:43.154
<i>I do solemnly declare.</i>

45:43.240 --> 45:46.676
I do...solemnly declare.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.193
God, those bloody workmen!

45:48.280 --> 45:50.191
They made a nice cup of tea.

45:50.280 --> 45:52.236
<i>They did.</i>

45:52.320 --> 45:53.639
Hey, does it actually count?

45:53.720 --> 45:55.870
Is it legal if you can't hear
the wedding vows?

45:55.960 --> 45:58.997
Um...you can lip-read them, though. Look.

46:03.560 --> 46:06.632
<i>Boo!
- Who took that, then?</i>

46:06.720 --> 46:08.631
I did.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.676
<i>Can't you tell?</i>

46:25.880 --> 46:27.472
<i>Oh, this is quality, Pete.</i>

46:29.280 --> 46:31.236
Real quality.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.832
Welcome to Chateau Marsden
for the arrival of the guests.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.670
What's that?
- Nothing.

46:40.760 --> 46:43.433
It looked like two naked men.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.875
It is.
- They're having a shower.

46:45.960 --> 46:49.430
I transferred the tape
onto one of Matthew's tapes.

46:49.520 --> 46:52.637
Your gay landlord?
- Ex-landlord.

46:52.720 --> 46:55.075
So our wedding is intercut with gay porn?

46:55.160 --> 46:57.674
<i>Don't get upset. He was devastated.</i>

46:57.760 --> 47:00.149
<i>That's one of his favourite films.</i>

47:01.200 --> 47:03.555
Now... OK, the cake.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.434
Not much of David and Karen in this.

47:08.520 --> 47:11.876
<i>Toast the happy couple, Adam and Rachel.</i>

47:11.960 --> 47:13.279
<i>Adam and Rachel.</i>

47:13.360 --> 47:15.112
Hey, where's my speech?

47:16.160 --> 47:18.310
Sorry. I had the record button on pause.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.356
Oh, yeah. Marvellous.

47:28.600 --> 47:30.556
That was nice.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.115
What, is that it?

47:34.200 --> 47:36.395
You told me to keep it short.

47:36.480 --> 47:38.471
Oh, you are a genius, you are.

47:38.560 --> 47:41.199
You couldn't hear the ceremony,
you missed my speech

47:41.280 --> 47:43.635
and the thing cuts out before
you reach the...
