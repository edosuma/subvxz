WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:05.739
I omitted some of
the patient reviews.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.108
That's why your
scores went up.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.077
I am truly so sorry.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.112
Your apology is
not accepted.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.715
Page Dr. Lim to the OR
for an emergency C-section.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.417
NURSE VILLANUEVA:
The baby's in distress.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.452
We need to open the duct
and oxygenate her blood.

00:18.586 --> 00:19.953
Call the pharmacy
for PGE, stat.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.789
Oh.
What?

00:21.922 --> 00:23.191
It's expired.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.826
Pulse not palpable.

00:25.959 --> 00:26.860
Restarting
compressions.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.163
Push 0.2.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.431
Dr. Murphy,
the baby is flatlining.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.665
No.
There's nothing
more we can do.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.201
No, I can save her!
Shaun.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.838
We just lost a baby
because this hospital
wasn't prepared.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.907
The medication
we needed was expired.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.477
Salen made cuts.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.945
We're... We're
behind on inventory.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.046
Expired.

00:47.781 --> 00:48.582
Shaun, stop,
stop, stop!
They're all... No!

00:48.716 --> 00:49.683
It wasn't your fault!

00:49.817 --> 00:51.051
There's...
You lied to me!

00:51.919 --> 00:53.221
I can't marry you.

00:54.755 --> 00:55.656
Okay.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.797
I'm right here.
I got you.

02:38.125 --> 02:42.763
I am so sorry for what
you all must be
going through.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.199
I can assure you
I've begun
an extensive review

02:45.333 --> 02:47.768
of pharmacy
inventory policy,

02:47.901 --> 02:50.404
and I will do everything
in my power to make sure

02:50.538 --> 02:52.606
that nothing like this
ever happens again.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.976
If there's anything
that you need...

02:56.109 --> 02:58.712
Counseling,
paid time off,

02:58.846 --> 03:00.814
just someone to talk to...
I'm available.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.116
Thank you.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.889
As I'm sure you know,
a lawsuit
is a possibility.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.759
We need to use the utmost
professional discretion

03:11.892 --> 03:14.027
in our communication
with the baby's mother.

03:14.161 --> 03:17.631
We're all very aware
of our professional
responsibilities.

03:19.733 --> 03:23.637
I just felt
a reminder never hurts.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.376
Whatever
you're thinking
of doing, don't.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.843
She's gonna
lecture us

03:29.977 --> 03:32.212
on professional
responsibility?

03:32.346 --> 03:34.382
A baby's dead because
of her narcissistic need

03:34.515 --> 03:36.417
to be a "disrupter"
instead of an
administrator.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.218
You're furious,
I get it.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.186
Take a day off.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.721
Take a personal day.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.055
Let her make
the first move.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.058
She is who she is.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.928
Which is the owner
of this hospital
and your employer.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.863
And she has
more experience

03:49.997 --> 03:52.199
in corporate and legal
matters than you,

03:52.333 --> 03:54.001
and if you go up
against her
in a fit of rage,

03:54.134 --> 03:55.235
you're gonna suffer
the consequences.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.273
I'm taking her down.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.090
I was surprised
you were gone
when I woke up.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.261
I'd hoped
we could've talked
before work.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.696
I don't want
to talk.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.468
You said you didn't
want to marry me.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.003
You can't drop a bomb
like that and expect me
to just accept it.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.542
I know you're hurting,

04:34.675 --> 04:37.077
and... And I want
to be there for you.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.446
I don't need your help.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.548
Shaun,
stop it, please.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.283
I made a mistake.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.420
But that can't just
erase everything
we've been through.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.456
You can't have
totally changed
how you feel about me

04:48.589 --> 04:49.723
over just one incident.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.927
Mmm.

04:54.061 --> 04:57.197
It wasn't just one.
It was three.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.468
You lied about
your trip to Montana,

05:00.601 --> 05:02.436
falsified
my performance rating,

05:02.570 --> 05:04.037
and refused to
make things right

05:04.171 --> 05:07.408
by correcting my scores
or telling Salen
what you'd done.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.079
I can't marry you.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.747
That doesn't
make any sense.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.783
We love each other.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.251
We can figure out a way
to work this out.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.527
I'm going to help
Dr. Park in the ER.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.507
Male, 32,
single car M.V.A.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.041
I'm so sorry.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.810
Please tell me
I didn't hurt anyone.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.344
For the tenth time,
all you messed up
was yourself,

05:44.478 --> 05:46.279
your car, and a tree.

05:46.414 --> 05:49.316
He has an open comminuted
tib/fib fracture.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.919
And by the smell,
I'm guessing
an off-the-chart B.A.C.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.353
I thought
she really liked me.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.790
But she just wanted
to be friends,
like all the rest.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.926
I'm such an idiot.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.994
Just a fat,
disgusting loser.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.362
Decent pulses.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.997
He'll need IV
antibiotics and surgery

06:04.131 --> 06:05.699
to I and D the wound
and repair the fracture.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.301
The leg can wait.
GCS is 13.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.570
Need head and trauma
CT pan scans

06:09.703 --> 06:10.771
to rule out
closed-head injury.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.139
Let's get him
to imaging.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.910
He's right.
He's an idiot.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.045
A very lucky one.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.981
Go ahead
and take a seat.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.349
Actually, I can't.

06:22.483 --> 06:26.019
Uh... I... I had surgery
a couple weeks ago

06:26.520 --> 06:27.921
in Brazil.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.824
They call it
a Brazilian Butt Lift.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.362
I know,
it's totally vain,

06:35.496 --> 06:39.366
but my whole life,
I've been unhappy
with my shape.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.335
Um, I've tried everything.
Diet, exercise,
waist trainers.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.539
But I'm 33-years-old,

06:45.673 --> 06:47.174
and every time
I look in the mirror,

06:47.307 --> 06:49.409
I can still hear the kids
in school calling me...

06:50.711 --> 06:52.746
Tater Tot
or SpongeBob.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.347
You don't have to justify
your decision to me

06:54.482 --> 06:55.716
or any other doctor.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.017
I'm here to help you.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.255
She has severe
surgical site infections

07:02.389 --> 07:03.757
with multiple abscesses.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.259
Gluteal fat grafting's not
as easy as it looks.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.028
Not something you
want to try to save
a few bucks on.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.396
She didn't go to Brazil
to save money.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.764
She went to prevent
being mocked

07:10.898 --> 07:12.065
and judged by
her own friends.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.667
She didn't need
to go at all.

07:13.801 --> 07:14.935
There's nothing wrong
with her belly
or her butt.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.036
Well, there's
nothing "wrong"

07:16.169 --> 07:17.170
with your hair,
either,

07:17.304 --> 07:19.707
but you spend oodles
of time and money on it.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.809
You're hilarious
and spend just as much

07:21.942 --> 07:23.777
on your skincare
and manscaping.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.579
This is fun. I wish
I had some popcorn.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.214
As it is,
it's a waste of time

07:27.347 --> 07:28.582
our patient
doesn't have.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.150
Get CTs
with contrast
to gauge

07:30.283 --> 07:32.019
the size and depth
of the abscesses,

07:32.152 --> 07:33.353
then schedule her for surgery
to incise and drain.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.788
On it.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.089
My skin looks good,
though, right?

07:41.161 --> 07:42.996
Could you do
me a favor?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.599
I need all the
documents related to
Ethicure's takeover.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.535
I'm doing some work
on regulatory responses

07:47.668 --> 07:49.069
and need info
from the contracts.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.838
Not exactly my area.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.173
But I'm sure
Salen has copies
of all that stuff.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.675
I don't want
to bother her.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.109
She's pretty
swamped today.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.911
I'm pretty sure
it's backed up
on the server.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.913
Okay.
Thanks.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.248
I'll print them out
for you.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.817
You can just e-mail them.
Mmm, better if I don't.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.853
Whatever your
real reason is
for wanting them,

08:05.986 --> 08:07.755
I'm sure you don't want
Salen to know.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.489
Paper copies
will be harder
for her to trace.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.527
Thank you.
Yeah.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.932
Hi, Alma.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.171
I'm Salen Morrison,
the CEO of Ethicure.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.775
I just wanted
to personally
offer my condolences.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.412
I don't have children.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.948
I can't even begin
to comprehend
the depth of your grief.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.856
I probably
shouldn't be doing this.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.158
My head of legal
is gonna freak,
but I don't care.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.459
You deserve to know.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.732
Dr. Lim and Dr. Murphy
were both truly heroic

08:51.865 --> 08:53.634
in their attempts
to save your baby's life.

08:55.736 --> 08:59.172
But there was an error
made by one
of our pharmacists,

08:59.306 --> 09:02.976
which caused Dr. Murphy
to briefly administer

09:03.110 --> 09:04.444
an expired medication.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.881
He quickly realized and
corrected the mistake,

09:08.015 --> 09:10.150
and it's unlikely
it had any effect,

09:11.819 --> 09:12.986
but it was a mistake,

09:14.822 --> 09:16.990
which we take
full responsibility for.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.694
The pharmacist
feels horrible.

09:20.828 --> 09:21.995
He's already resigned.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.064
Oh, my God.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.903
Ethicure will cover

09:30.037 --> 09:31.371
all of your
medical expenses,

09:32.840 --> 09:35.075
provide counseling
for you or for anyone

09:35.208 --> 09:36.644
in your family
who needs it.

09:38.478 --> 09:41.081
And I've authorized
an immediate
payment of $200,000

09:41.214 --> 09:42.482
for your
pain and suffering.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.923
I'm... I'm not sure
what to say.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.024
It's the least
we can do.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.034
I just need you to sign
a short consent form.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.070
So our accounting
department can
issue the payment.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.190
If anybody should
be fired here,
it should be you.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.392
I warned you.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.227
I told you that something
like this would happen

10:27.360 --> 10:28.228
if you went ahead
with the changes.

10:28.561 --> 10:29.930
Hmm.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.965
That's not how
I remember it.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.967
You do realize
that I have notes

10:34.101 --> 10:36.136
from every meeting
we ever had,

10:36.269 --> 10:37.637
copies of every e-mail?

10:39.406 --> 10:42.509
What I realize is
you've never
sued anyone before,

10:42.642 --> 10:46.780
while I've sued
and been sued by
my co-founders, banks,

10:46.914 --> 10:51.084
billionaires, and the guy
who used to prune
my rose bushes.

10:51.218 --> 10:54.554
Which is why I have
multiple lawyers
on retainer.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.089
So if I were you,

10:56.223 --> 10:58.759
I'd stop threatening
and start negotiating.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.798
I want my job.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.100
I deserve it.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.669
No, you don't.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.338
Because you
killed a baby.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.308
So you're gonna
take your severance

11:15.442 --> 11:17.978
and agree to a legally
enforceable promise

11:19.146 --> 11:21.715
to go away
and keep
your mouth shut.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.800
DR. PARK: No sign of any
intracranial bleed

12:12.933 --> 12:14.367
or injury to
chest or abdomen.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.936
We should brief Lim
and get him to the OR

12:16.069 --> 12:17.237
for the surgery
on his leg.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.175
That silence
mean you agree?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.178
Mmm?

12:25.813 --> 12:27.080
Oh.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.415
I was distracted.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.952
You're right.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.487
We'll need to do
two surgeries...

12:34.621 --> 12:35.989
A prophylactic fasciotomy

12:36.123 --> 12:38.191
and then stabilize
the tib/fib fractures.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.060
Whatever you think
is best.

12:47.034 --> 12:50.103
You want to talk?
Mmm, I already said...

12:50.237 --> 12:53.807
I mean about what happened
last night in the pharmacy.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.913
No.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.715
Talking about it
won't change anything.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.722
<i>You know, I've never</i>
<i>seen him like this before.</i>

13:09.857 --> 13:11.925
It's like I'm suddenly
a totally different
person to him.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.861
Yeah, give him
some time.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.562
Have you
talked to him?

13:15.695 --> 13:16.796
Yeah.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.165
And what did
he say?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.299
I don't know.
He... He's Shaun,
you know?

13:19.432 --> 13:20.934
What's he gonna say?

13:21.068 --> 13:23.403
Sometimes men
need more time
to get over stuff.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.439
Okay, that is
both sexist
and wrong.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.740
He's totally
cut me out.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.042
He refuses to
talk to me at all.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.377
Well,
he's stressed.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.346
You know,
he's retreating
into medicine.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.948
You're using that
as a metaphor,

13:35.082 --> 13:37.250
but he literally
ran away from me

13:37.384 --> 13:38.718
in the cafeteria
this morning.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.923
Okay, I'll talk to him.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.424
Thank you.

13:50.797 --> 13:51.631
Excuse me?

13:52.966 --> 13:54.167
You're Phil Hall's
doctors, right?

13:54.301 --> 13:55.268
Yes.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.004
Apparently
only family
can see him,

13:57.137 --> 13:58.872
but the nurses said that
if I talked to you,
that maybe...

13:59.006 --> 14:01.274
Are you the woman
who told him she just
wanted to be friends?

14:03.944 --> 14:05.845
He told you that?
Yes.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.281
That's why he got so
drunk and crashed
his car into a tree.

14:09.782 --> 14:10.750
Oh, my God.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.487
Could you at least
tell him that I'm here

14:14.621 --> 14:17.324
and that I care about
him and that I hope
he's gonna be okay?

14:18.926 --> 14:20.660
We can tell him.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.295
But it won't make him
feel any better.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.299
We'll tell him.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.844
The abscesses are huge.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.947
And multiloculated.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.482
The surgeon probably
tried to inject
too much fat.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.651
There doesn't
appear to be any
intra-abdominal

14:44.784 --> 14:46.886
or pelvic
involvement yet.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.155
She should've hid
from her friends

14:48.288 --> 14:49.689
in Beverly Hills,
not Brazil.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.325
Or just learned to love
the body God gave her.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.894
You two really have such
strong beliefs about
aesthetic surgery

14:55.028 --> 14:56.396
or do you just get off
on arguing with each other?

14:56.529 --> 14:58.665
He doesn't believe
strongly in anything.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.133
Just likes
to provoke me.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.835
I just want to get
you to open your
mind a little.

15:02.970 --> 15:03.971
You know, not be
so judgmental.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.674
I'm the judgmental one?

15:07.807 --> 15:10.643
Mr. "I never date a guy
who drives a sports car,

15:10.777 --> 15:13.947
"can't dance, or who
doesn't like
<i>'The Golden Girls'"?</i>

15:14.081 --> 15:15.748
I get the car and the dancing,
but <i>"The Golden Girls"?</i>

15:18.018 --> 15:19.352
I'm not gonna date
a total moron.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.355
My chest
is starting to hurt.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.260
It feels like something's
squeezing my...

15:27.394 --> 15:28.761
Petechial rash
on the neck and...

15:28.895 --> 15:30.063
Oh!

15:31.664 --> 15:33.700
BP's crashing.
She's hypoxic and agitated.

15:33.833 --> 15:34.867
We need high-flow oxygen.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.470
DR. PARK:
Muscle injuries

15:37.604 --> 15:39.206
are actually not
as severe
as I expected.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.940
DR. LIM: The fact
he was so drunk
probably helped him.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.875
Kept the arteries
from thrombosing.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.777
Need more saline
in the pulse lavage.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.379
I'm not surprised
he got friend-zoned.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.282
You see the woman
in the waiting area?

15:49.416 --> 15:51.084
That's who he was
drowning his
sorrows over?

15:51.218 --> 15:53.553
Mm, bit out
of his league.
Yeah.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.488
You don't think
a woman like her

15:55.622 --> 15:59.126
could ever fall in love
with a guy like him?

15:59.259 --> 16:01.461
Eh, it's possible,
if he was rich
or a rock star.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.365
So you think all women
are greedy and shallow?

16:05.498 --> 16:07.367
Humans are
greedy and shallow,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.002
and it's silly
to pretend we're not

16:09.136 --> 16:11.404
just because it's nicer
to talk about
the world that way.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.440
Saline's clear.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.908
No bleeding,
no sign of
muscle necrosis.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.144
Good job.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.247
Dr. Lim, you got a page
from Lea Dilallo.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.748
Tell her
I'm on my way.

16:21.881 --> 16:24.351
Place the ex-fix
to stabilize
the fractures for now.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.019
We can do
a more extensive
reconstruction

16:26.153 --> 16:27.320
after the swelling's
gone down.

16:27.454 --> 16:28.788
Murphy can take
lead on that.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.425
Murphy, you hear me?

16:36.029 --> 16:36.996
Yes.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.810
That was fast.
It was actually
incredibly slow.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.113
I had to route
the downloads
through a proxy

16:53.246 --> 16:56.316
and print at different
nurses' stations to
stay untraceable.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.784
Thank you.
Hold on.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.152
These too.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.790
You said
you wanted everything.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.992
It came out to over
4,000 pages.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.460
Damn it.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.762
What exactly
are you looking for?

17:11.931 --> 17:12.965
I'm not sure.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.121
Looks complicated.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.824
He has a severe
comminuted fracture

17:37.957 --> 17:39.058
with significant
bone loss.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.228
The standard ex-fix
puts him at high risk

17:41.361 --> 17:42.562
for deformity
and malunion.

17:45.031 --> 17:48.435
Hey, Shaun, I...
I know you know
that I'm on your side,

17:48.568 --> 17:50.237
no matter what.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.139
But for whatever
it's worth,

17:52.272 --> 17:53.673
I think you and Lea
make a very
good couple.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.508
No, I don't want to
talk about Lea.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.510
Why?

18:03.216 --> 18:04.517
Why?

18:09.055 --> 18:10.690
Dr. Park says
women are shallow.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.159
He said that about Lea?

18:12.292 --> 18:14.461
She's never dated anyone
like me before.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.431
Okay, Shaun,
Lea might be flaky
and impulsive,

18:18.565 --> 18:20.533
but, my God,
she's not shallow.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.670
She made a mistake,
Shaun.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.172
Give her a break.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.107
I have to go.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.250
DR. REZNICK: Some of
the injected fat got
into your bloodstream

18:37.384 --> 18:39.186
and embolized
to your lungs.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.887
We can treat them
with medication.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.555
But blood thinners
will make the surgery

18:42.689 --> 18:45.091
on the abscesses
too risky.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.327
We need to delay repairing
the aesthetic surgery

18:47.460 --> 18:49.429
until after we fix
the clots in your lungs.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.731
How long
will that take?

18:51.864 --> 18:53.132
At least a few days.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.103
And even with
broad spectrum
antibiotics,

18:57.237 --> 19:00.173
the infection could
spread and damage
your glute muscles.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.574
Possibly even cause
necrosis.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.311
You mean
like dying flesh?

19:04.444 --> 19:05.845
We'll do everything
we can to...

19:05.978 --> 19:08.615
No way. I...
I don't care
how risky it is.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.151
I want my butt
fixed first.

19:12.285 --> 19:15.755
If we don't reduce
the clot burden to
your lungs immediately,

19:15.888 --> 19:17.657
the complications
could be life-threatening.

19:17.790 --> 19:21.194
You said you could
do them both.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.764
You want to risk your
life to avoid an injury
to your butt?

19:25.097 --> 19:26.766
Yes.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.501
I already took
a huge risk.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.304
I traveled halfway
around the world to fix
the way I look,

19:31.438 --> 19:34.274
and there is no way
I'm gonna go
backwards now.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.678
But what Dr. Reznick
is recommending

19:38.811 --> 19:40.813
isn't going backward.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.617
It's making the best
out of an awful situation.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.023
You said you wouldn't
judge me.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.427
I told you
what I want.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.662
Are you gonna
help me or not?

19:57.297 --> 19:58.465
Yes.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.236
Aspirate
the superficial
collection,

20:03.370 --> 20:04.871
start blood thinners,
and schedule her

20:05.004 --> 20:06.506
for a surgery
first thing
in the morning.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.357
Your friend's
first surgery went well,

20:24.491 --> 20:26.559
but he needs to stay
under observation

20:26.693 --> 20:28.661
until we finish
stabilizing
his leg fractures.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.498
Can I see him?

20:31.631 --> 20:34.867
No. But Dr. Park told him
what you'd said.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.171
Thank you.
I'll come back tomorrow.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.713
Why could you never
be more than just
friends with him?

20:50.149 --> 20:51.250
Um...

20:52.184 --> 20:54.587
Phil is
a really great guy.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.690
I do love him.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.827
I even tried
for a while.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.930
I thought I could get
past it, that I was
being shallow.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.733
But it's how
I feel.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.869
I shouldn't
just settle.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.384
This is...

21:35.127 --> 21:37.897
DR. LIM: She doesn't
own the place.
At least not yet.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.832
By law, the State
Attorney General

21:39.966 --> 21:43.069
has to approve the
change from non-profit
to for-profit status.

21:43.202 --> 21:45.572
That hasn't happened,
which means the
deal's not closed.

21:45.705 --> 21:46.773
That doesn't make
any sense.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.275
She's been
running the place
for months.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.943
These
acquisitions
take time.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.479
The buyer
has to take control

21:52.612 --> 21:55.147
before the regulatory
requirements are finalized.

21:55.281 --> 21:58.150
And one requirement is,
"For-profit status

21:58.284 --> 22:00.052
"cannot adversely affect
the obligation

22:00.186 --> 22:02.489
"to serve
the community interest."

22:02.622 --> 22:04.090
And there's no
way the A.G.'s
gonna agree

22:04.223 --> 22:05.992
that killing babies
"serves the
community interest."

22:07.960 --> 22:10.329
Okay, but why are
you telling me?

22:10.463 --> 22:13.766
Because while I know
what she did, I don't
have written proof.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.504
Well, I'm sorry.
I, um...

22:17.637 --> 22:19.906
I took the severance.
Agreed to a non-disclosure.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.674
Then give it
back and...
And tear it up.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.112
She fired you for
something she forced
you to do,

22:26.245 --> 22:28.481
made you the scapegoat
for everything she's done

22:28.615 --> 22:31.117
and will continue to do
if you don't stop her.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.585
If we don't stop her.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.854
I have a wife
and two kids.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.690
I... I need to know
that I can get another job.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.392
And what about
sleeping at night?

22:39.526 --> 22:42.028
Don't act like
you've never made
a compromise,

22:42.161 --> 22:44.864
done something at work
that you thought was wrong.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.099
We all make compromises.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.603
But I know you believe
this is a lot
more than that

22:50.737 --> 22:53.205
because you're
a decent man,

22:53.339 --> 22:56.576
a father trying
to do right
by his kids.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.845
But what happens
when they ask you why
you changed jobs?

23:00.212 --> 23:01.981
Will you tell
the truth,

23:02.114 --> 23:03.816
or will you look your kids
in the eye and lie?

23:13.860 --> 23:14.861
Okay.

23:17.029 --> 23:17.830
What do you need?

23:30.843 --> 23:32.211
You think
Morgan's right?

23:34.280 --> 23:36.849
That we constantly argue
because we like it?

23:39.385 --> 23:41.554
No. It's part
of the job.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.856
We have to kick
the tires
on every idea.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.358
But we don't have to
kick each other.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.529
We?

23:49.662 --> 23:51.498
You're the one who said
my skin looked like
the Crypt Keeper's.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.267
I was obviously joking.

23:55.401 --> 24:00.106
You were obviously
annoyed because
I expressed an opinion.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.141
My problem is not you
expressing your opinion.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.943
It's that you attribute
all of mine
to a personal flaw.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.079
Maybe growing up
where you did,

24:07.213 --> 24:08.948
you weren't exposed to
a lot of strong women.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.453
And maybe growing
up where you did,

24:14.587 --> 24:16.623
it's common to insult
people's mothers.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.057
I didn't say anything
about your mother.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.526
Have you ever even met
a Hasidic woman?

24:19.659 --> 24:20.860
Is there a problem?

24:20.993 --> 24:22.194
No.
No.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.063
Then why are you
still in here
and not in the OR

24:24.196 --> 24:25.397
getting our patient
positioned for surgery?

24:26.232 --> 24:27.900
Sorry.
On it.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.476
I can't stop
thinking about
what Monica said.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.078
Who's Monica?

24:39.211 --> 24:41.548
Lea thinks I'm not
good enough
to be her husband.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.616
Is that the issue?
Because that's ridiculous.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.485
No, it's not ridiculous.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.621
She told me before
that we could never be

24:48.755 --> 24:50.623
more than just friends
because of my ASD.

24:50.757 --> 24:53.059
And now she knows
she was wrong, right?

24:53.192 --> 24:54.326
No.

24:54.460 --> 24:57.463
She saw me save a patient
from a collapsed building,

24:57.597 --> 24:59.131
which shouldn't
have made her
realize anything

24:59.265 --> 25:00.767
because she already
knew I was a good doctor

25:00.900 --> 25:02.434
who could save patients.
Shaun...

25:02.569 --> 25:05.137
And she wanted
you to come back
from Montana

25:05.271 --> 25:06.939
so she wouldn't be
burdened with me
on her own,

25:07.073 --> 25:09.075
and she changed my
client satisfaction scores

25:09.208 --> 25:10.943
because she thinks
I can't succeed by myself.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.011
That's not quite true.
Yes, it is.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.713
Okay.
I don't want
to be married

25:13.846 --> 25:16.015
to someone who is just
settling for me,

25:16.148 --> 25:18.050
especially because
all her other boyfriends

25:18.184 --> 25:20.887
were just drummers
and jerks and...

25:21.020 --> 25:22.488
Okay, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

25:22.989 --> 25:24.523
Sit down.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.125
Shaun, sit down.
Okay.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.398
Lea is not settling.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.302
You're... You're
hardworking and honest

25:36.435 --> 25:39.305
and loyal and brilliant,
and she's lucky
to have you,

25:39.438 --> 25:40.773
and she damn well
knows it.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.311
Shaun, sometimes
when people
love us, they...

25:45.444 --> 25:47.546
They want to help,
and they help
at the wrong time

25:47.680 --> 25:49.982
and for the wrong reasons
in the wrong way.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.484
But Lea loves you.

25:53.653 --> 25:54.854
She loves you.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.197
Okay.
I have to go.

26:11.838 --> 26:14.473
Okay, for your
surgery, we'll be
inserting screws

26:14.607 --> 26:16.575
and a series of
circular rings with
connecting rods...

26:16.709 --> 26:17.509
Is Monica still here?

26:18.544 --> 26:19.946
No, she went home
last night.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.948
Connecting
rods between...

26:22.081 --> 26:24.383
She waited all day,
obviously cares
about you.

26:26.218 --> 26:28.087
That's just pity.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.389
Which makes me feel like
an even bigger loser.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.424
Stop it.
You did something
irresponsible,

26:32.558 --> 26:34.293
but you're not a loser.
You wouldn't understand.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.030
You're good-looking,
muscular.

26:39.165 --> 26:40.432
I'm sure you were always
a great athlete.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.835
If she's that superficial,
would you have
fallen for her?

26:44.671 --> 26:47.139
Maybe she's afraid
of committing.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.941
If you back off,
let things develop,

26:49.075 --> 26:50.076
maybe she'll change
her mind.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.750
You really think so?

26:57.884 --> 26:58.885
It can't hurt to try.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.221
She won't change
her mind.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.424
And you don't think
she ever will.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.428
He said there's no
way a woman who
looked like her

27:09.561 --> 27:11.130
would ever love a guy
who looked like you.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.968
Connecting rods
between each
circular ring.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.171
What the hell
are you doing?

27:19.305 --> 27:20.907
You... You were
lying to him.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.408
No, I was trying to
cheer him up,

27:22.541 --> 27:25.244
which is not only
nice but medically
beneficial.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.279
Look, I understand
you're going
through some stuff,

27:27.413 --> 27:28.614
but if you're not
able to get
your head straight

27:28.748 --> 27:30.382
and focus on the job,

27:30.516 --> 27:32.551
you need to let
someone else
do this surgery.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.787
I can focus fine.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.461
I did it.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.230
Found exactly
what we need
to get rid of her.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.998
You found $52 million?

27:46.132 --> 27:46.999
We don't need
to buy her out,

27:47.133 --> 27:48.100
because she hasn't
bought us.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.036
Not yet.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.670
And once the A.G. gets
the information

27:51.804 --> 27:53.472
I convinced Fremes
to turn over,

27:53.605 --> 27:56.042
she never will.
Fremes the pharmacist?

27:56.175 --> 27:58.244
He signed an N.D.A.
He... He took a check.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.678
Which he regrets.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.647
He's willing to pass
up the money
and come forward.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.916
Well, that's very
heroic of him,
but it's irrelevant.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.685
The A.G. isn't
gonna blow up
this deal.

28:06.819 --> 28:09.121
We have proof
that she was
warned her policies

28:09.255 --> 28:11.724
would endanger patients,
but she forced them
through anyway.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.664
Let me get this straight.

28:18.798 --> 28:22.301
You're gonna rely on
someone who's already
signed an N.D.A.,

28:22.434 --> 28:25.371
who's taken money,
not to mention that Salen

28:25.504 --> 28:28.140
has top-dollar lawyers
and lobbyists who
are gonna argue

28:28.274 --> 28:31.210
that the baby didn't die
from expired meds

28:31.343 --> 28:34.680
but from a car crash
and premature delivery

28:34.814 --> 28:37.149
and a pre-existing
cardiac condition.

28:39.485 --> 28:42.321
Look, I... I...

28:42.454 --> 28:46.158
I agree with you that
Salen should not be
running a hospital.

28:46.292 --> 28:49.128
But there isn't an
A.G. in America who
would take this on.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.329
Unless it comes
from you.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.070
Fine.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.238
We'll go in
on our own.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.550
DR. ANDREWS: Bleeding's
not as bad as I'd feared.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.886
We need
great hemostasis

29:14.020 --> 29:15.721
so there's no unsightly
fluid collections.

29:15.855 --> 29:16.823
Definitely don't
want that.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.359
No, we definitely don't.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.428
This isn't the first
time you let your
personal feelings

29:22.561 --> 29:25.031
about aesthetic surgery
impact patient care.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.299
Patients have
a right to make
their own decisions,

29:27.433 --> 29:29.101
but they also deserve
my honest opinion

29:29.235 --> 29:30.903
of the risks and benefits.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.106
Honest and professional.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.942
Which means based on
the medicine,

29:36.075 --> 29:37.043
not your personal bias.

29:40.046 --> 29:43.215
Patients deserve to benefit
from their surgeon's
life experience.

29:46.718 --> 29:49.388
And clearly felt
comfortable enough to
make her own decision.

29:49.521 --> 29:52.391
<i>He's right.</i>
<i>They make a good team.</i>

29:58.730 --> 30:01.333
She's hemodynamically
unstable. End-tidal
CO2 plummeting.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.869
Did we cause
a venous air embolism?

30:03.002 --> 30:06.072
No, it's not air.
She's thrown more
pulmonary clots.

30:06.205 --> 30:07.639
We need mechanical
thrombectomy, STAT.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.313
Adding an additional
Schanz screw.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.182
Dr. Park,
can you add
more traction

30:16.315 --> 30:17.649
to facilitate
fracture reduction?

30:18.184 --> 30:19.251
How's that?

30:19.785 --> 30:20.920
Perfect.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.054
Dr. Lim,
you've got a call.

30:22.188 --> 30:23.255
I'm a little busy.

30:23.389 --> 30:24.556
It's Dr. Fremes.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.993
He says it's urgent.

30:27.126 --> 30:29.161
The meeting's
already set.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.997
No, I... I understand
that she's worried,

30:31.130 --> 30:32.999
but your kids need a father
they can look up to,

30:33.132 --> 30:34.633
someone they can
be proud of.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.335
No. No, no.
It can't just be my word.

30:36.903 --> 30:38.170
I need your...

30:42.074 --> 30:43.842
Spineless prick.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.448
Her pressure's dropping.

30:49.581 --> 30:51.984
Increase vasopressors
and limit fluid
overloading.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.586
These damn fat clots
are harder to aspirate
than a blood clot.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.389
Can you use
a stent retriever?

30:57.523 --> 30:59.391
No, it's better to just
go with a larger bore
aspiration catheter.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.060
Should we stop
what we're...
No, keep going.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.294
No reason
to back up now.

31:08.834 --> 31:09.801
Got it.

31:09.936 --> 31:10.937
Come on.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.704
Hold on.

31:14.773 --> 31:15.574
Hold on.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.312
Got you,
you little bastard.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.450
She's crashing!

31:24.583 --> 31:26.485
Gotta be more
in her heart.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.254
Let's run an echo,
optimize pressers

31:28.387 --> 31:29.655
for her cardiac
parameters,

31:29.788 --> 31:31.323
and prep her femoral
for cerebral angio.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.231
The surgery
was a success.

31:39.365 --> 31:42.201
Dr. Lim let Dr. Park
and I do it almost
all on our own.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.239
You want to go out and
have a drink tonight?

31:47.373 --> 31:49.942
Do you really think Lea
realized she was wrong
about my ASD?

31:52.011 --> 31:54.180
Were you just lying
to cheer me up?

31:54.313 --> 31:56.015
Have I ever lied before?
Oh, yes.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.917
Okay. I'm not lying.

32:00.652 --> 32:01.954
Mmm.

32:04.323 --> 32:07.159
Okay. I used to let
Robin Johnson
copy off my test.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.927
She'd tell me
how cute I was.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.063
But Michelle Plasse
told me Robin would
make fun of me

32:11.197 --> 32:12.898
behind my back.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.367
Both seemed nice
but one of them
was lying.

32:15.501 --> 32:16.902
Shaun, you're not
a kid anymore.

32:17.036 --> 32:20.272
But I'm still weird.

32:20.406 --> 32:21.807
Yes, you're weird.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.876
I'm weird.
Everyone's weird.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.778
Everyone feels weird
at some point.

32:26.912 --> 32:30.382
Everyone feels ugly
or stupid or old
or whatever it is.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.821
That doesn't
help at all.

32:37.823 --> 32:38.790
I know.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.603
What's wrong?

32:51.737 --> 32:55.141
If you can still speak
and see us... Nothing.

32:55.274 --> 32:56.408
You had us
very worried.

32:57.876 --> 33:00.112
We had to remove
multiple clots
from your heart

33:00.246 --> 33:01.413
and brain
during surgery.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.782
But now...

33:03.915 --> 33:07.653
We were able to
debride the gluteal
abscesses.

33:07.786 --> 33:11.157
We won't know for
sure until we see
how you heal, but...

33:11.290 --> 33:14.393
Doesn't look like
there'll be
any visible scarring

33:14.526 --> 33:15.427
or deformity.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.299
Thank you.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.637
PLANTE:
<i>I don't understand.</i>

33:25.771 --> 33:28.140
You told my associates
that you and Dr. Fremes

33:28.274 --> 33:29.741
had actual evidence.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.611
And now not only
do you not have
any documents,

33:32.744 --> 33:34.012
you don't have
Dr. Fremes.

33:34.146 --> 33:36.982
Because he was
intimidated into silence
by Salen Morrison.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.617
Into silence?

33:38.750 --> 33:40.786
Or into taking
responsibility
for his own actions?

33:40.919 --> 33:43.489
I don't understand
how a mistake
made in an OR

33:43.622 --> 33:45.857
or a hospital pharmacy
could possibly
be the fault

33:45.991 --> 33:47.659
of your parent
company's CEO.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.229
She sidelined our president
and began inserting herself

33:50.362 --> 33:51.630
into medical decisions.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.999
She consistently reduced
the quality of care

33:54.133 --> 33:55.867
to boost
Ethicure's profits.

33:56.001 --> 33:58.704
Dr. Lim, I get that
these takeovers

33:58.837 --> 34:00.872
may involve policy changes
that you don't approve of...

34:01.006 --> 34:03.642
If she started her own
for-profit hospital,

34:03.775 --> 34:05.877
she'd have every
right to run it
however she saw fit.

34:06.011 --> 34:08.647
But she didn't do that.
She bought ours...
Aa non-profit.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.383
Which means
she's legally obligated

34:11.517 --> 34:13.452
to serve the community,
the whole community,

34:13.585 --> 34:15.287
not just patients
with premium insurance.

34:16.322 --> 34:17.356
And you have
a responsibility

34:17.489 --> 34:19.691
to make sure that
means something.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.660
That it's not
just fine print
in a contract

34:21.793 --> 34:22.894
no one will ever read.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.064
I agree.

34:26.198 --> 34:30.102
But do you
have any actual
evidence of fraud

34:30.236 --> 34:32.504
or criminal activity
done by Salen Morrison?

34:34.173 --> 34:35.507
I have a dead baby.

34:37.042 --> 34:39.678
And that is Salen
Morrison's fault.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.681
And I guarantee
this is gonna happen
again and again

34:42.814 --> 34:45.517
if you don't step in
and do what only
you can do to stop it.

34:51.157 --> 34:52.791
Let me think,
and I'll get back to you.

34:56.061 --> 34:56.962
Thank you.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.202
Dr. Murphy
did a great job.

35:05.204 --> 35:06.672
You've a long
road ahead

35:06.805 --> 35:08.240
and probably
a few more surgeries,

35:08.374 --> 35:11.076
but it looks
very good.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.880
You have no nerve
injuries and both
bones in your shin

35:15.013 --> 35:16.548
have been stabilized
with good alignment.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.452
Did Monica come back?

35:21.920 --> 35:23.389
No.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.894
Good.

35:29.027 --> 35:30.596
I don't need her pity.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.131
And you were right.

35:33.265 --> 35:35.133
She obviously
wasn't gonna
change her mind.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.568
Maybe you should
change yours.

35:38.904 --> 35:40.972
I get the feeling
that you also
care a bit too much

35:41.106 --> 35:42.574
about how your
dates look,

35:42.708 --> 35:44.543
how they make you look
to other people

35:44.676 --> 35:47.213
instead of how they make
you feel about yourself.

35:47.346 --> 35:50.782
Is that your way of
telling me that because
I'm fat and ugly

35:50.916 --> 35:52.318
I should only
date women
who are the same?

35:52.451 --> 35:53.585
I don't think
you're fat or ugly.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.088
But if you want
to find someone

35:57.223 --> 35:58.590
who loves you more
than just a friend,

35:59.825 --> 36:01.193
you need to start
loving yourself.

36:06.097 --> 36:08.500
Just get out
and leave me alone.

36:09.968 --> 36:11.603
Let the nurse know
if you need more
meds for the pain.

36:19.645 --> 36:20.779
What're you looking at?

36:22.781 --> 36:25.116
I just... I told you,
just... Just get out.

36:29.288 --> 36:30.622
Dr. Park is right.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.625
You should listen
to him.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.374
I can't
believe it.

36:48.507 --> 36:54.012
We actually saved
her lungs, her brain,
and her ass.

36:54.145 --> 36:55.681
That's a triple play.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.384
She's lucky she didn't
end up with major
organ damage.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.218
She was lucky
to have us.

37:07.158 --> 37:10.296
The way we fight
all the time at work?

37:10.429 --> 37:12.331
That's how it is with me
and my oldest brother.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.233
He drives me insane.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.468
But I love him.

37:20.306 --> 37:23.342
He also thinks a beard
makes him look taller.

37:24.643 --> 37:27.178
That was unkind
and uncalled for.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.247
Or the truth.

37:39.925 --> 37:40.926
Hello?

37:41.727 --> 37:42.761
This is she.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.199
Thank you. I...
I really appreciate
your taking the time.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.274
No, actually,
I don't understand.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.644
Good night.
How was your meeting?

38:36.982 --> 38:38.116
What meeting?

38:39.250 --> 38:40.652
Your meeting
with the A.G.

38:46.725 --> 38:49.160
I've always been
open with you, Audrey.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.464
Tried to help
you understand
what it is

38:52.598 --> 38:53.999
I'm trying to
accomplish here.

38:56.435 --> 38:59.438
And you went behind
my back and tried
to destroy it all.

39:03.609 --> 39:05.010
I'm never gonna
forget it.

39:31.503 --> 39:32.971
I don't want
to cancel
our wedding.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.808
We love each other

39:38.343 --> 39:42.380
and are good
for each other.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.516
And I forgive you for
lying about your
trip to Montana

39:44.650 --> 39:46.017
and changing my scores.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.519
I know you were just
trying to help me.

39:49.488 --> 39:50.822
Thank you.

39:57.963 --> 40:01.667
Did you want
Dr. Glassman
to come back

40:03.234 --> 40:04.903
so you wouldn't have
to take care of me
on your own?

40:07.473 --> 40:09.841
I wanted him to come
back because
he cares about you.

40:09.975 --> 40:12.611
And I know
that you care
about him, too.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.447
I don't need you to
take care of me.

40:15.581 --> 40:18.249
I know. And I don't
mean to smother you.

40:18.383 --> 40:20.151
I... I just want
to help you

40:21.152 --> 40:22.688
and be there for you.

40:27.158 --> 40:28.860
Do you believe I'm not
good enough for you?

40:30.361 --> 40:32.063
That you're not
good enough?

40:32.197 --> 40:33.364
What're you even
talking about?

40:33.499 --> 40:36.134
You told me once
that you could
never be

40:36.267 --> 40:38.303
in a relationship with me
because of my ASD.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.474
Is that what you think?

40:42.608 --> 40:44.209
It's what you said.

40:44.342 --> 40:46.478
Yeah, a long time ago.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.514
Are you seriously
telling me
that you don't see

40:48.647 --> 40:50.248
a difference in how
I feel about you?

40:50.381 --> 40:51.717
That I haven't
grown at all?

40:51.850 --> 40:53.685
Our relationship
hasn't grown?

40:53.819 --> 40:56.087
Shaun, all I was trying
to do is help someone
that I love,

40:56.221 --> 40:58.890
to be there for you
like you've been
there for me.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.693
But you just can't seem
to see it that way,

41:01.827 --> 41:03.829
no matter how many
times I've tried.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.164
I mean, is every mistake
I make going
to be something

41:06.297 --> 41:07.799
that you hold against
me forever?

41:07.933 --> 41:10.602
No, I...
I am forgiving you.

41:10.736 --> 41:12.604
No, I don't need you
to forgive me.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.973
And I'm done.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.308
I'm... I'm done
apologizing
for helping you

41:17.442 --> 41:19.477
and caring about you
and whatever
else I'm doing

41:19.611 --> 41:22.047
that you seem to find
so unbearable.

41:22.180 --> 41:25.116
Yes. No... No,
that's not what I said.

41:25.250 --> 41:27.653
No. What you're saying
is that I'm not good
enough for you.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.454
That's actually
not true...

41:29.588 --> 41:31.322
And if that's what
you feel, then fine.

41:31.456 --> 41:32.824
Maybe we shouldn't
get married.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.427
Mmm-hmm.
And you know what?

41:36.562 --> 41:38.664
Maybe we shouldn't even be
living together,

41:38.797 --> 41:40.932
so I'm gonna get
out of your way. Totally.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.804
And you can sleep
in your own bed tonight,

41:45.937 --> 41:47.205
and first thing tomorrow,

41:47.338 --> 41:48.707
I'll start looking
for a new place to live.
