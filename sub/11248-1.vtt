01:05.702 --> 01:06.773
Excuse me...

02:10.064 --> 02:13.015
Come here, honey.

02:13.791 --> 02:15.059
So how did it go?

02:15.495 --> 02:17.775
Very well. We went towards
the dam, and then...

02:17.815 --> 02:18.735
How did it go?

02:18.815 --> 02:21.535
Very well. We went towards the dam,
and then to the old town.

02:21.735 --> 02:23.415
You don't like
the old town, do you?

02:23.935 --> 02:26.015
So did you have fun
with your friends?

02:26.295 --> 02:27.895
Did you have fun
with your friends?

02:28.135 --> 02:29.535
And were you a good boy?

02:29.935 --> 02:31.575
You were a good boy.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.455
You were mommy's good boy.

03:04.895 --> 03:06.895
So... how did it go?

03:12.415 --> 03:14.015
Very well.
Impeccably.

03:14.055 --> 03:15.375
We went towards the dam...

03:15.415 --> 03:17.295
But did he feel good?

03:18.615 --> 03:19.335
Excuse me?

03:19.735 --> 03:21.855
Did he feel good?
Fulfilled?

03:22.575 --> 03:25.455
He's somewhat of a loner.
He's anxious.

03:26.055 --> 03:28.055
He doesn't like the
company of other animals.

03:29.215 --> 03:31.455
No...
It went impeccably.

03:32.415 --> 03:33.655
He was with other dogs.

03:34.695 --> 03:35.535
They ran.

03:35.775 --> 03:38.095
And...

03:39.695 --> 03:40.895
they talked to each other.

03:40.935 --> 03:41.855
That's good.

03:42.535 --> 03:44.175
Very good.
Wonderful.

03:45.255 --> 03:46.135
Thank you.

03:47.535 --> 03:48.375
Thank you, madam.

03:55.095 --> 04:00.135
PRICELESS

04:01.015 --> 04:01.935
Honey?

04:05.535 --> 04:06.415
Honey?

04:09.735 --> 04:10.655
Honey?

04:11.735 --> 04:13.295
Jacques, I can't believe it.

04:16.095 --> 04:16.855
Get up.

04:17.375 --> 04:18.894
Come on.

04:19.535 --> 04:20.654
Get on the bed.

04:24.295 --> 04:25.175
Do you feel well?

04:25.535 --> 04:26.735
Very well.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.215
And you?

04:30.215 --> 04:31.535
You're completely drunk.

04:33.135 --> 04:35.215
It took you 3 hours to get ready.

04:35.455 --> 04:36.655
Look how much you've drunk.

04:36.695 --> 04:37.695
Don't worry.

04:38.175 --> 04:40.255
These are little bottles.

04:40.295 --> 04:41.935
You could have made an effort today.

04:41.975 --> 04:44.215
Don't argue with me, honey.

04:45.255 --> 04:48.175
I hate it when people
tell me the truth.

04:48.415 --> 04:49.495
Right.

04:50.535 --> 04:51.295
Don't move.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.615
I'll give you a second pillow.

04:54.175 --> 04:55.215
Thank you.

04:59.495 --> 05:02.735
In 2 minutes I'll
be at your disposal.

05:06.455 --> 05:07.655
Dammit.

05:19.535 --> 05:20.335
Jean?

05:21.215 --> 05:22.055
I'm sorry.

05:26.015 --> 05:27.095
You look awful.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.855
- Did you walk the dogs again?
- Yes.

05:29.935 --> 05:31.455
And today morning
I took care of supplies.

05:31.535 --> 05:33.135
Why do you accept this work?

05:33.855 --> 05:36.375
They're so used to me accepting,
that I don't dare refuse.

05:37.095 --> 05:38.135
Besides, I have the time.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.775
Do as you like.
It's not my problem.

05:40.575 --> 05:41.735
But don't fall asleep in the bar.

05:41.775 --> 05:42.775
Sure.
Of course.

05:43.255 --> 05:44.775
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.015
I'm leaving now.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.735
- Can you close up?
- Yes, of course.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.055
He'll leave if
you turn down the lights.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.055
Excuse me.

06:01.255 --> 06:02.255
I'd like another one.

06:06.895 --> 06:08.495
It's good you turned
down the lights.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.575
It's nicer this way.

06:09.655 --> 06:10.695
Thank you, sir.

06:10.895 --> 06:14.175
Can you turn on the TV?
There's a live broadcast on Eurosport.

06:14.255 --> 06:15.095
Yes, sir.

06:19.775 --> 06:20.655
Sit down.

06:21.055 --> 06:22.575
I'm not allowed to
leave the bar, sir.

06:22.535 --> 06:23.415
Really?

06:23.415 --> 06:25.615
Really. Except to serve drinks and...

06:26.495 --> 06:27.575
in case of a fire.

06:28.735 --> 06:29.575
Yes, sir.

06:29.855 --> 06:30.815
Sit down.

06:45.175 --> 06:46.295
Have a cigar.

06:48.015 --> 06:49.455
Have a cigar.

06:55.735 --> 06:57.935
The leaves grow in
the middle of cocoa fields.

07:00.255 --> 07:02.935
That's what gives them
their particular aroma.

07:04.135 --> 07:05.055
Do you smell it?

07:05.575 --> 07:06.335
Yes, sir.

07:07.815 --> 07:10.495
Because of the embargo against Cuba,
I fly them in by private jet.

07:11.535 --> 07:13.655
One cigar costs about...

07:14.695 --> 07:15.815
120 euros.

08:27.535 --> 08:28.415
Good evening.

08:38.655 --> 08:39.414
I'm sorry.

08:39.655 --> 08:41.575
This is the first time
I've fallen asleep like this.

08:42.174 --> 08:44.455
Considering the mood here,
I don't see anything better to do.

08:45.455 --> 08:46.535
This place is dead.

08:46.575 --> 08:48.855
No. It was brimming with life earlier.

08:50.455 --> 08:51.535
But now it's a bit late.

08:51.695 --> 08:54.135
It's not normal, that there isn't
anyone at the bar at this hour.

08:55.215 --> 08:57.255
Normally, they aren't
allowed to leave before 3 a.m.

08:59.535 --> 09:00.615
It's forbidden.

09:01.135 --> 09:02.255
Unless there isn't anyone.

09:02.335 --> 09:03.295
But you're here.

09:04.055 --> 09:04.855
Yes.

09:05.775 --> 09:06.895
And I'm here, right?

09:07.655 --> 09:08.295
Indeed.

09:08.495 --> 09:10.295
Something like this wouldn't
happen at the Carlton.

09:10.575 --> 09:11.615
You know, the Carlton...

09:12.015 --> 09:13.895
Do you think their
service has worsened as well?

09:17.255 --> 09:18.455
Do you think he'll come back?

09:19.215 --> 09:19.815
Who?

09:19.935 --> 09:20.775
The barman.

09:23.615 --> 09:24.295
I don't know.

09:29.575 --> 09:31.095
Will you wait with me for him?

09:31.135 --> 09:32.615
Yes.
Of course, miss.

09:34.295 --> 09:35.055
That's nice of you.

09:38.335 --> 09:39.655
Your cigar smells nice.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.455
Normally I can't stand the smell,
but in this case...

09:43.695 --> 09:44.455
Yes...

09:46.415 --> 09:47.415
It's because of the leaves,

09:47.815 --> 09:50.895
which grow in the
middle of cocoa fields.

09:51.775 --> 09:52.495
Really?

09:54.415 --> 09:57.095
They're flown in from Cuba
by private jet because of the...

10:02.975 --> 10:03.815
Because of the embargo?

10:03.855 --> 10:04.535
That's it.

10:17.095 --> 10:17.935
Are you alright?

10:18.855 --> 10:20.175
Today is my birthday.

10:21.015 --> 10:22.335
Happy birthday, miss.

10:23.015 --> 10:24.255
It's off to a bad start.

10:30.615 --> 10:32.575
I wanted so much
to have fun tonight.

10:35.255 --> 10:37.815
I'd give anything for
a cocktail and some music.

10:50.535 --> 10:51.495
What are you doing?

10:52.255 --> 10:53.535
Cocktails are my specialty.

10:54.295 --> 10:55.255
Isn't this too risky?

10:55.735 --> 10:58.335
In the worst case,
I'll just say I work here.

11:08.895 --> 11:10.055
So what would you like?

11:10.455 --> 11:11.255
I don't know.

11:12.175 --> 11:13.535
Something that gives a feeling of joy.

11:13.575 --> 11:15.615
For your birthday I suggest
something with champagne.

11:15.655 --> 11:16.735
And that gets you drunk fast.

11:17.095 --> 11:18.255
Gets you drunk fast...
Then...

11:18.295 --> 11:19.215
A cocktail with champagne.

11:19.255 --> 11:20.295
Excellent.
Wonderful.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.295
I love to watch someone work.

11:49.255 --> 11:51.735
I'm always impressed by
people who can do something.

11:52.735 --> 11:53.775
I can't do anything.

11:54.855 --> 11:55.535
Actually I can.

11:56.015 --> 11:57.255
I can make conversation.

12:06.135 --> 12:06.735
And you?

12:08.055 --> 12:08.735
Right.

12:29.055 --> 12:29.935
I'll have another one.

13:06.375 --> 13:07.535
Which floor are you staying at?

13:07.935 --> 13:08.455
Me?

13:10.175 --> 13:10.815
Yes, you.

13:10.855 --> 13:11.535
The fifth...

13:12.455 --> 13:13.335
The fifth floor.

13:20.855 --> 13:21.975
The imperial suite.

13:24.655 --> 13:25.815
I only know the royal one.

13:29.815 --> 13:31.055
- Will you give me a tour?
- Sure.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.775
The dressing room.

13:41.935 --> 13:43.935
Here we have the living room.

13:47.935 --> 13:48.775
The living room.

13:49.175 --> 13:50.775
The first bathroom.

13:53.975 --> 13:57.415
Here we have the study, with
a wireless internet connection.

13:58.775 --> 13:59.775
And a fax.

14:02.255 --> 14:03.455
The bedroom.

14:04.695 --> 14:05.815
This way, please.

14:09.735 --> 14:11.375
You must be very rich.

14:11.975 --> 14:13.055
Why do you say that?

14:13.415 --> 14:15.175
Must I do everything for you?

14:15.375 --> 14:16.335
What?

14:31.415 --> 14:34.895
Happy... birthday... to... you...

14:35.975 --> 14:40.215
Happy... birthday... to... you...

15:22.855 --> 15:24.015
Did they leave the royal suite?

15:24.095 --> 15:24.975
They left this morning.

15:25.015 --> 15:26.175
They stole a bathrobe.

16:02.695 --> 16:08.735
ONE YEAR LATER...

16:20.695 --> 16:22.015
The coffee, ladies and gentlemen.

16:22.055 --> 16:23.335
Who'll be having the decaf?

16:53.935 --> 16:54.975
Excuse me.

16:56.655 --> 16:57.535
Excuse me.

16:59.615 --> 17:00.455
Is everything alright?

17:10.375 --> 17:11.335
Jean, but...

17:12.734 --> 17:13.494
What are you doing?

17:16.535 --> 17:17.575
Jean, are you alright?

17:21.415 --> 17:22.694
Thank you very much, sir.

17:26.575 --> 17:28.655
I'm not hungry.

17:28.695 --> 17:29.975
What will you have?

17:30.775 --> 17:32.175
What you picked.
Good idea.

17:32.615 --> 17:33.575
With pleasure.

17:38.735 --> 17:40.655
- Irene?
- Yes?

17:44.575 --> 17:45.815
Happy birthday.

17:56.855 --> 17:58.175
Thank you, Jacques.

18:39.655 --> 18:40.655
Are you alone?

18:43.255 --> 18:44.335
For the moment.

18:47.895 --> 18:49.015
And your...

18:49.775 --> 18:50.775
uncle?

18:51.655 --> 18:53.375
You're talking about my great-uncle?

18:54.575 --> 18:55.655
He's growing old.

18:57.135 --> 18:58.215
Will you have a cocktail?

19:00.135 --> 19:01.095
Just one?

19:50.375 --> 19:51.255
What the...

19:54.655 --> 19:56.695
Older people get up early.

19:57.335 --> 19:59.135
You should know that by now.

20:00.055 --> 20:01.855
I couldn't sleep at all.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.575
I went to the beach
to get some fresh air.

20:04.615 --> 20:06.575
I also couldn't sleep.

20:07.215 --> 20:10.015
And I saw you at the bar
with that guy.

20:10.055 --> 20:12.535
You were tenderly getting
some fresh air on the sofa.

20:16.615 --> 20:17.895
I'm sorry, Jacques.

20:18.575 --> 20:19.855
I don't know what came over me.

20:21.695 --> 20:23.415
That was the first time.
I swear.

20:48.015 --> 20:50.055
In a few months I'll see
you at the same place

20:50.095 --> 20:51.175
where I picked you up.

20:51.495 --> 20:53.495
At the hotel bar,
wearing a mini,

20:54.135 --> 20:55.855
with the same fake
expression of indifference.

20:56.415 --> 20:57.535
I'm not worried.

20:58.495 --> 21:01.055
You'll be so drunk
you'll ask me my name.

21:01.775 --> 21:03.415
You'll offer me a drink.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.295
Dammit.
I can't believe it.

21:09.295 --> 21:10.415
I'm so stupid.

21:25.575 --> 21:26.375
Dammit.

21:48.335 --> 21:49.215
Dammit.

21:53.095 --> 21:55.295
I left him.
I left it all for you.

22:03.575 --> 22:04.695
Did you forget something?

22:04.975 --> 22:05.935
I forgot you.

22:09.135 --> 22:09.975
Excuse me?

22:11.535 --> 22:13.655
But... weren't you supposed
to leave today?

22:15.175 --> 22:15.975
Jean?

22:17.375 --> 22:18.135
Yes?

22:20.615 --> 22:21.495
I left him.

22:23.615 --> 22:24.895
I left it all for you.

22:25.815 --> 22:26.655
Really?

22:26.815 --> 22:27.695
Yes.

22:29.775 --> 22:31.095
Tell me I did the right thing.

22:31.775 --> 22:32.855
You did the right thing.

22:46.215 --> 22:47.775
I want to spend every
hour with you.

22:54.815 --> 22:56.655
- Do you know what would make me happy?
- I don't.

22:57.055 --> 22:57.975
A trip to the Maldives.

22:58.415 --> 22:58.975
Where?

22:59.015 --> 23:00.455
The Maldive Islands.
You don't know them?

23:00.495 --> 23:03.415
I do.
But not all of them.

23:03.495 --> 23:06.095
But first we'll order
a big breakfast.

23:06.255 --> 23:07.935
When I'm happy
I'm also very hungry.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.455
And this time we'll
spend the morning in bed.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.095
You're not the type of person
who works all the time?

23:14.095 --> 23:14.935
That depends.

23:50.855 --> 23:51.975
Do something.

24:02.175 --> 24:04.695
Damn, what are you doing here?
Everyone downstairs is looking for you.

24:10.135 --> 24:12.015
Dammit.
I can't believe it.

24:23.535 --> 24:24.615
Get out of here.

24:24.655 --> 24:26.575
In 2 minutes I'm sending
Martine to clean the room.

24:26.615 --> 24:27.735
Damn, I can't believe it.

24:37.815 --> 24:39.135
I can't believe it's you.

25:07.495 --> 25:10.055
You've arrived in Nice.

25:10.095 --> 25:11.575
This is the last stop.

25:11.615 --> 25:13.815
We ask all passengers to
get off the train.

25:14.015 --> 25:16.735
We ask that you make sure you
haven't left anything on the train.

25:16.575 --> 25:18.655
The next train will
arrive at 2 o'clock.

25:29.455 --> 25:30.135
Henri?

25:30.375 --> 25:31.215
It's Irene.

25:31.775 --> 25:32.655
Irene Mercier.

25:33.095 --> 25:35.095
We met at that social gathering.

25:36.775 --> 25:38.375
At the casino in Cannes.

25:38.575 --> 25:39.495
Last year.

25:41.575 --> 25:42.455
I'm sorry.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.015
Yes, of course.

25:45.175 --> 25:46.295
Maybe some other time?

25:46.335 --> 25:48.895
My number is...
Bye.

25:49.495 --> 25:50.335
Asshole.

25:50.735 --> 25:51.495
Dominique?

25:51.855 --> 25:52.495
It's Irene.

25:54.455 --> 25:56.135
We met at the VIP club last year.

25:56.775 --> 25:58.775
You spilled your
glass on my dress.

25:59.695 --> 26:01.215
Irene.
That's right.

26:01.375 --> 26:02.255
Very well.

26:03.895 --> 26:04.735
For how long?

26:06.055 --> 26:06.815
Too bad.

26:07.815 --> 26:08.775
Baire?

26:08.895 --> 26:09.775
It's Irene.

26:09.815 --> 26:10.495
Ivan?

26:10.575 --> 26:11.415
It's Irene.

26:11.735 --> 26:14.095
Single, small but well-proportioned.

26:14.615 --> 26:15.855
Yes, Irene, that's right.

26:15.895 --> 26:17.015
Benoit?

26:17.255 --> 26:17.695
Asshole.

26:17.735 --> 26:18.575
Philippe?

26:18.615 --> 26:19.495
It's Irene.

26:21.215 --> 26:25.375
Don't you remember the meeting
in Dauville last year?

26:30.775 --> 26:31.615
I'm sorry.

26:33.135 --> 26:34.335
My condolences.

26:36.495 --> 26:37.895
Are you his son?

26:39.615 --> 26:40.695
Grandson?

26:41.815 --> 26:43.215
So we must be the same age.

27:11.815 --> 27:12.895
What are you doing here?

27:13.335 --> 27:16.335
Reception told me you asked for
the schedule of trains to Nice.

27:17.055 --> 27:18.535
I'm going around from
one bar to the next.

27:20.135 --> 27:21.055
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

27:23.415 --> 27:24.735
Fine, alright.

27:28.935 --> 27:29.655
Good bye.

27:29.895 --> 27:31.335
I didn't get the chance this morning.

27:33.455 --> 27:34.615
So I came by train.

27:35.415 --> 27:36.815
No kidding?
You didn't fly in by jet?

27:39.415 --> 27:40.775
I really wanted to say I'm sorry.

27:42.375 --> 27:43.655
I wanted to say it to you.

27:45.095 --> 27:47.095
I'm sorry for what I did.

27:47.815 --> 27:49.335
Fine.
You've said it now.

27:49.815 --> 27:50.535
So good bye.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.695
I thought we could go
have dinner together.

27:52.775 --> 27:54.335
Are you nuts?
I won't eat dinner with you.

27:54.575 --> 27:55.495
I want you to go away.

27:56.215 --> 27:57.055
I feel bad...

27:57.095 --> 27:58.415
I don't care how you feel.

27:58.735 --> 28:00.655
Do you understand? I don't care.
I have a date.

28:00.695 --> 28:01.535
So good bye.

28:02.375 --> 28:03.135
How about tomorrow?

28:05.735 --> 28:07.415
Do you know who that
was back at the hotel?

28:07.655 --> 28:09.215
We were going to get
married in 3 months.

28:09.535 --> 28:10.295
3 months.

28:10.375 --> 28:12.295
He adored me.
I even had an engagement ring.

28:12.495 --> 28:14.615
I'd be done with the bars,
the mini and the smiles.

28:14.695 --> 28:15.415
Do you understand?

28:15.455 --> 28:17.095
I'd be set until the end of my life.

28:17.135 --> 28:17.775
I'm sorry.

28:18.215 --> 28:20.055
So am I.
You don't know how badly.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.255
And now I have to start all over.

28:22.495 --> 28:23.975
So if you want to do me a favor,

28:25.215 --> 28:26.855
then just leave me alone.

28:31.575 --> 28:33.135
You don't have the
time for a drink?

28:34.255 --> 28:35.015
Dammit.

28:36.855 --> 28:38.655
It's probably the second to your left.

28:39.015 --> 28:41.255
You go out and it's
the second to your left.

28:41.735 --> 28:43.295
Going out, the second to your left.

28:44.055 --> 28:44.855
Going out.

28:45.535 --> 28:46.295
François?

28:47.255 --> 28:47.815
Yes.

28:49.255 --> 28:50.495
- Irene?
- Yes.

28:50.735 --> 28:52.255
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

28:55.015 --> 28:56.375
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:57.615 --> 29:00.495
I love Italian food,
because it's never pretentious.

29:01.015 --> 29:03.015
And we never expect
anything out of the ordinary,

29:03.055 --> 29:04.215
so we're never disappointed.

29:04.255 --> 29:04.775
Right?

29:06.095 --> 29:06.775
Indeed.

29:09.535 --> 29:10.455
It depends.

29:10.935 --> 29:14.215
But when in Italy, I don't like
to eat in the local restaurants.

29:15.135 --> 29:16.055
It's less amusing.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.655
Maybe because they don't make
the effort to act like Italians.

29:19.455 --> 29:20.175
Maybe.

29:22.775 --> 29:23.535
Listen...

29:24.415 --> 29:27.375
That guy next to the
cars is watching us.

29:28.415 --> 29:29.935
And I feel funny.

29:36.975 --> 29:37.895
But I don't know him.

29:38.215 --> 29:39.935
He was with you at
the bar when I arrived.

29:40.335 --> 29:42.495
And now he's here and
I think he's waiting for us.

29:43.895 --> 29:44.815
And I feel uneasy.

29:45.375 --> 29:45.935
I'm sorry.

29:46.575 --> 29:47.615
This is ridiculous, François.

29:47.775 --> 29:50.455
You seem to love pasta,
so you can eat mine.

29:56.335 --> 29:57.775
Can I leave you my number?

30:08.495 --> 30:10.255
Is your invitation to
dinner still open?

30:11.255 --> 30:12.015
Yes, of course.

30:12.455 --> 30:14.255
I found a really nice pizza
shop in the old town.

30:14.295 --> 30:16.655
No. I don't eat at nice pizza shops.

30:16.855 --> 30:18.015
Alright.
As you wish.

30:18.815 --> 30:20.775
120 EUROS
115 EUROS

30:22.855 --> 30:24.295
230 EUROS
180 EUROS

30:34.295 --> 30:35.895
I'd like some caviar.

30:39.895 --> 30:40.935
The crawfish.

30:42.255 --> 30:43.095
And some champagne.

30:44.295 --> 30:45.135
And you?

30:46.295 --> 30:47.175
What will you have?

30:49.975 --> 30:51.335
I don't know.
I need to think it over.

30:51.815 --> 30:53.215
Available at next delivery.

30:53.255 --> 30:53.815
What?

30:53.855 --> 30:55.975
The crawfish. It will be
available at next delivery.

30:56.615 --> 30:57.775
The delivery has just arrived.

30:59.535 --> 31:00.335
Good.

31:00.375 --> 31:01.135
I feel relieved.

31:03.535 --> 31:04.295
So?

31:05.535 --> 31:07.095
I need to leave you for a moment.

31:18.855 --> 31:20.055
Good evening, Mr. Molluquet.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.295
This is a message from Mr. Simon.

31:24.775 --> 31:29.255
Can you wire my bonus
to my current account?

31:30.095 --> 31:31.895
My whole bonus.

31:32.735 --> 31:34.815
Tomorrow morning.
I'd appreciate it.

31:35.695 --> 31:37.255
I'll confirm it later in writing.

31:37.495 --> 31:38.215
Thank you.

31:38.455 --> 31:39.695
Good bye, Mr. Molluquet.

31:54.295 --> 31:55.495
We'll order a second one.

31:55.775 --> 31:57.015
It's sad with just one bottle.

31:57.495 --> 31:58.455
It's boring.

32:01.815 --> 32:03.695
I didn't want to lie
to you at the Biarritz.

32:04.415 --> 32:06.255
I just didn't want to oppose you.

32:07.255 --> 32:08.575
You seemed so happy.

32:11.175 --> 32:12.255
And I was in heaven.

32:13.255 --> 32:14.535
I don't really like caviar.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.255
I force myself to eat it.

32:18.855 --> 32:20.175
And with time I'll
start to like it.

32:21.295 --> 32:22.895
I'm sure that when
I start to like it,

32:24.175 --> 32:25.335
it will taste great.

32:30.615 --> 32:31.775
It's nice here, isn't it?

32:32.455 --> 32:34.815
I like this place a lot
because it's not pretentious.

32:36.135 --> 32:37.775
It's calm and grand
at the same time.

32:39.935 --> 32:41.375
We have the impression
that we're unique.

32:49.655 --> 32:50.895
The handle is made from shark bone.

32:51.175 --> 32:52.095
Amazing, isn't it?

32:52.655 --> 32:53.975
The bones are dried for 2 years.

32:54.615 --> 32:56.455
It takes one shark to
make one set of cutlery.

32:59.975 --> 33:00.895
Here you go.

33:12.175 --> 33:13.135
I'm bushed.

33:14.495 --> 33:15.495
I want to go to bed.

33:16.375 --> 33:17.535
At which hotel are you staying?

33:19.535 --> 33:23.095
I found a small, very nice
hotel in the town's suburbs.

33:23.135 --> 33:23.855
Very good.

33:25.015 --> 33:27.255
So go get your stuff
and we'll meet back here.

33:28.175 --> 33:28.775
Here?

33:29.415 --> 33:30.695
It's more simple that way, right?

33:32.535 --> 33:33.135
Yes.

33:33.455 --> 33:34.615
- Is there a problem?
- No.

33:34.655 --> 33:35.535
No. Not at all.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.335
See you later.

33:58.855 --> 33:59.575
Mr. Simon?

34:00.735 --> 34:01.615
Yes, that's right.

34:02.135 --> 34:04.455
Ms. Mercier is waiting
for you in room 304.

34:04.815 --> 34:05.415
Thank you.

34:05.975 --> 34:07.375
Did you enjoy your dinner?

34:08.375 --> 34:09.655
Yes, very much.

34:09.695 --> 34:11.375
May I ask for your credit card?

34:11.895 --> 34:12.655
Excuse me?

34:13.175 --> 34:15.534
Your credit card.
To cover the bill.

34:15.655 --> 34:16.895
Right.
Of course.

34:29.775 --> 34:30.534
Thank you.

34:32.614 --> 34:34.375
Please take Mrs. Pontini's
baggage to her room.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.255
- We're sorry.
- It's alright.

34:52.775 --> 34:53.935
I have exactly the same.

34:54.295 --> 34:55.415
They're the same color?

34:55.455 --> 34:56.215
That's right.

36:30.335 --> 36:31.015
Yes?

36:33.015 --> 36:33.895
Mr. Molluquet.

36:34.775 --> 36:35.535
How are you?

36:36.935 --> 36:37.575
Excuse me?

36:39.535 --> 36:40.295
No.

36:42.935 --> 36:44.335
No one stole my card.

36:47.215 --> 36:48.175
That much?

36:51.375 --> 36:53.975
Please wire the money from my
PEL account to my current account.

36:55.815 --> 36:56.615
And my PEP account?

36:58.655 --> 36:59.495
And my PEA account?

37:02.175 --> 37:03.175
Go ahead.
No problem.

37:03.855 --> 37:04.695
Please do tell me.

37:04.775 --> 37:05.935
Do I have the right to the CEL?

37:07.055 --> 37:07.815
Well that too then.

37:09.975 --> 37:11.015
How much money is in it?

37:13.015 --> 37:14.015
I assumed there's more.

37:14.735 --> 37:15.335
160 EUROS

37:15.375 --> 37:16.255
Well?

37:17.295 --> 37:18.575
Do you really want to go to town?

37:18.615 --> 37:19.255
Yes.

37:20.135 --> 37:20.895
Are you sure?

37:20.935 --> 37:22.015
Yes, why do you ask?

37:23.415 --> 37:23.975
620 EUROS

37:24.695 --> 37:25.495
Why do you ask?

37:26.015 --> 37:26.815
What do you think?

37:32.495 --> 37:33.495
300 EUROS

37:35.055 --> 37:35.975
What's wrong?

37:36.575 --> 37:37.455
Nothing.

37:37.415 --> 37:38.055
Good.

37:41.855 --> 37:42.455
Can we go?

37:46.455 --> 37:47.695
You can't continue doing this.

37:47.935 --> 37:49.735
This is my business.
I'm paying, right?

37:51.975 --> 37:52.575
Indeed.

37:54.655 --> 37:55.735
And that's what counts, right?

37:58.935 --> 37:59.655
Indeed.

37:59.695 --> 38:00.495
So what's wrong?

38:00.535 --> 38:01.295
Nothing.

38:01.335 --> 38:02.175
So let's go for a walk.

38:02.215 --> 38:03.295
I don't want to go for a walk.

38:04.135 --> 38:05.135
What do you want?

38:14.895 --> 38:15.975
I want a handbag.

38:25.855 --> 38:26.575
What is it?

38:28.415 --> 38:30.535
I feel good, because I'm
not working this afternoon.

38:31.295 --> 38:32.695
I feel like I'm skipping class.

38:34.935 --> 38:35.655
Me too.

38:37.855 --> 38:38.975
On top of that I'm drunk.

38:40.455 --> 38:42.535
Better to be drunk in the
afternoon than in the evening.

38:42.895 --> 38:43.975
It's much better this way.

38:46.975 --> 38:48.655
We have the impression
we're keeping a secret.

38:51.015 --> 38:52.935
Would you like anything else?
Maybe some ice cream?

38:53.535 --> 38:54.375
I want a dress.

39:15.895 --> 39:16.415
Have mercy.

39:16.455 --> 39:17.655
OPERATION CAN'T BE PERFORMED

39:22.655 --> 39:24.375
THANK YOU FOR YOUR VISIT

39:29.295 --> 39:30.935
This one is gorgeous.

39:46.855 --> 39:48.455
Castelles cake!
I love it!

40:20.935 --> 40:21.815
Here you go.

40:22.495 --> 40:23.935
I got you a place in first class.

40:26.095 --> 40:26.815
Thank you.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.135
So, good bye.

40:30.895 --> 40:31.535
Good bye.

40:33.055 --> 40:33.735
Wait.

40:39.735 --> 40:40.575
Another 10 seconds.

41:02.855 --> 41:03.655
The 10 seconds are up.

41:14.495 --> 41:15.215
Fine.

41:16.695 --> 41:17.335
Fine.

41:18.655 --> 41:19.575
Fine, thank you.

41:21.935 --> 41:23.175
Ask Jeff to come here.

41:24.095 --> 41:25.375
You're not looking for a barman?

41:25.415 --> 41:26.455
I have very good credentials.

41:26.855 --> 41:27.615
No, sir.

41:29.055 --> 41:31.535
I'm sorry sir, but I'm
forced to call the police.

41:31.935 --> 41:33.295
Can't we work something out?

41:34.335 --> 41:37.735
Pool man, room service,
porter, driver?

41:37.855 --> 41:38.495
No, sir.

41:38.855 --> 41:39.775
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

41:40.215 --> 41:41.935
Can someone give me
a hand with my bag?

41:41.975 --> 41:43.455
I'll send over Benoit.

41:43.495 --> 41:45.215
Don't trouble yourself.

41:46.815 --> 41:49.055
My friend will be delighted
to give me a hand.

41:54.335 --> 41:56.695
You were very eager to
help me last time.

42:32.855 --> 42:37.175
Add the bill of room 304
to the account of room 429.

42:47.375 --> 42:50.015
- Shall we get out?
- Yes, of course.

43:06.255 --> 43:07.135
And?

43:10.655 --> 43:11.855
Will you close the door?

43:12.095 --> 43:12.735
Yes.

44:05.375 --> 44:06.055
Good evening.

44:14.455 --> 44:15.535
Which floor?

44:15.975 --> 44:16.815
The third floor.

45:13.255 --> 45:14.255
Good morning, sir.

45:14.775 --> 45:15.415
Good morning.

45:27.575 --> 45:28.375
Is everything alright?

45:31.735 --> 45:33.735
Impossible.
You'll never go away.

45:33.775 --> 45:34.655
This isn't about you.

45:34.695 --> 45:36.095
Yesterday I had a
problem with paying...

45:36.135 --> 45:37.775
You have to leave me alone,
do you understand?

45:38.055 --> 45:38.975
I have to work, Jean.

45:39.255 --> 45:39.935
Calm down.

45:39.975 --> 45:41.775
Do you think you can
go around having a crush?

45:41.895 --> 45:42.615
It's not about that.

45:42.655 --> 45:45.015
I met this woman and
she made me an offer...

45:45.055 --> 45:45.895
Stop it.

45:45.935 --> 45:46.935
I know why you're here.

45:47.135 --> 45:48.175
I'm telling the truth.

45:48.215 --> 45:49.615
You think I don't know
what's going on?

45:49.735 --> 45:50.775
That I don't know that look?

45:51.855 --> 45:53.655
Since I was 12 I've seen that look.

46:03.175 --> 46:04.135
Good morning, Madeleine.

46:04.455 --> 46:05.215
Did you sleep well?

46:05.575 --> 46:06.615
Very well, thank you.

46:07.455 --> 46:08.415
Have you picked something?

46:08.575 --> 46:09.215
Excuse me?

46:09.735 --> 46:10.655
Have you been served?

46:10.855 --> 46:12.495
No, but everything is fine.

46:12.895 --> 46:14.095
Won't you sit down?

46:16.455 --> 46:17.415
Excuse me.

46:32.095 --> 46:33.375
Shall I bring you something?

46:33.895 --> 46:35.855
Not now.
That's nice of you, thank you.

47:27.455 --> 47:28.135
What's going on?

47:29.895 --> 47:31.015
You had a bad dream.

47:31.495 --> 47:32.935
But that's good because
now you're awake.

47:32.975 --> 47:34.095
I know what your color is.

47:34.135 --> 47:35.335
You need something that's blue.

47:43.695 --> 47:47.255
We'll keep the indigo shirt
and the lavender one,

47:47.295 --> 47:49.855
the blue one and
the navy-blue one.

47:50.295 --> 47:51.855
But certainly not those
two remaining ones.

47:52.815 --> 47:53.415
Gilles?

47:53.775 --> 47:55.375
Can you bring me that pink dress?

47:55.535 --> 47:56.135
Yes.

48:08.975 --> 48:10.175
And this one, Jean?

48:11.455 --> 48:12.175
Yes.

48:12.215 --> 48:13.295
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

48:13.375 --> 48:14.695
Yes, I'm trying it on.

48:17.415 --> 48:19.615
So... doing a little shopping?

48:19.815 --> 48:20.175
A little.

48:20.215 --> 48:20.815
And?

48:21.815 --> 48:22.495
It's very nice.

48:23.295 --> 48:25.815
She's the friend I told you about.

48:26.815 --> 48:28.615
She's accepted to help
me for a while.

48:29.175 --> 48:31.175
You don't call me miss anymore?

48:31.375 --> 48:32.495
We have to pick something.

48:32.535 --> 48:33.695
We can't buy 36 shirts.

48:34.095 --> 48:34.815
And I've had enough.

48:35.495 --> 48:36.175
I have to go.

48:37.055 --> 48:38.335
My friend is in a hurry.

48:46.255 --> 48:47.495
Can you spare me 10 seconds?

48:58.775 --> 49:00.175
You look very nice in that shirt.

49:00.215 --> 49:00.855
Thank you.

49:09.095 --> 49:09.735
I'm coming.

49:11.175 --> 49:12.975
I took two. I didn't know
which one you want.

49:13.255 --> 49:13.895
Both.

49:14.255 --> 49:15.015
Of course.

49:24.775 --> 49:25.975
Finally you're smiling.

49:26.655 --> 49:28.335
It's nice to be
well-dressed, isn't it?

49:28.255 --> 49:28.975
Yes.

49:29.535 --> 49:30.215
We're leaving.

50:49.295 --> 50:50.535
Come in, the door is open.

50:57.655 --> 50:58.455
4 days.

50:58.975 --> 50:59.935
What did you get?

51:00.535 --> 51:01.175
Shirts.

51:02.015 --> 51:02.855
Those 4 shirts?

51:03.535 --> 51:04.415
And a pair of jeans.

51:05.095 --> 51:05.975
That's it?

51:07.455 --> 51:08.975
Today morning I had
a wonderful breakfast,

51:10.095 --> 51:11.255
with room service.

51:11.935 --> 51:13.255
And an extra serving of pancakes.

51:13.455 --> 51:14.975
Jean, I can't believe it.

51:15.455 --> 51:16.495
We haven't gone out much.

51:16.855 --> 51:17.815
She's shafted you.

51:18.455 --> 51:19.215
I'll wait a bit.

51:19.255 --> 51:20.695
Wait for what?
That she'll marry you?

51:21.055 --> 51:23.415
Take. Take as much as you can.

51:23.615 --> 51:25.575
A new suit, glasses, shoes.
Take, Jean.

51:25.775 --> 51:26.935
Otherwise what's it for?

51:29.855 --> 51:31.655
Do you have 5 minutes?
I'm free until noon.

51:32.175 --> 51:34.575
No, in half an hour I'm
going to a garden party.

51:35.295 --> 51:36.495
I love such parties.

51:36.895 --> 51:39.855
I'll look around and
maybe pick someone up.

51:40.415 --> 51:41.655
The guy you're with now is no good?

51:41.695 --> 51:43.135
I'm with him for the time being.

51:43.175 --> 51:43.855
Why is that?

51:44.415 --> 51:46.375
He's been divorced 4 times
and pays 4 ex-wives alimony.

51:46.415 --> 51:47.335
He doesn't have much left.

51:47.655 --> 51:49.095
Believe me, you can
find someone better.

51:49.775 --> 51:51.135
- Is she married?
- She's a widow.

51:51.895 --> 51:52.895
You're lucky.

51:53.775 --> 51:54.575
When will you be back?

51:56.055 --> 51:56.855
I don't know.

51:57.295 --> 51:58.335
Will we see each other later?

51:58.375 --> 51:59.095
Of course.

51:59.815 --> 52:01.335
- We're neighbors, aren't we?
- Indeed.

52:07.815 --> 52:10.495
Wombats and other koala bears,
who don't know what fear is,

52:10.655 --> 52:14.015
always find out too late that
they can't defend themselves.

52:21.655 --> 52:22.255
Are you alright?

52:22.855 --> 52:23.495
I'm fine.

52:24.375 --> 52:25.295
How was it?

52:25.895 --> 52:26.695
Very good.

52:26.895 --> 52:27.935
I have a gift for you.

52:31.415 --> 52:32.135
What is it?

52:32.255 --> 52:33.015
Guess.

52:33.295 --> 52:34.215
Excellent, thank you.

52:34.255 --> 52:35.055
I don't know...

52:36.295 --> 52:37.135
A suit?

52:37.335 --> 52:38.095
Glasses?

52:38.415 --> 52:39.055
Shoes?

52:45.855 --> 52:46.695
A bar of gold?

53:07.375 --> 53:08.495
They're beautiful, aren't they?

53:09.015 --> 53:11.255
Yes.
Very beautiful.

53:21.615 --> 53:23.295
She can't treat you like that.

53:23.335 --> 53:24.415
This can't go on.

53:24.735 --> 53:25.375
She has the money.

53:25.415 --> 53:26.015
So what?

53:28.415 --> 53:30.135
You have a soul.

53:30.815 --> 53:31.535
Youth.

53:31.935 --> 53:32.575
Charm.

53:33.975 --> 53:34.935
Make use of it.

53:37.615 --> 53:38.815
Do you think I have charm?

53:42.135 --> 53:44.095
You say that to someone
you don't find attractive.

53:45.015 --> 53:46.535
But charm is more
valuable than beauty.

53:47.215 --> 53:49.295
You can resist beauty,
but you can't resist charm.

53:49.975 --> 53:51.655
Show me how you...

53:52.495 --> 53:53.375
seduce someone.

53:53.935 --> 53:55.095
How I seduce someone?

53:55.135 --> 53:58.375
You must have a trick you practiced
in front of the mirror when you were 15.

53:58.415 --> 53:59.575
No, I don't.

54:03.215 --> 54:04.095
Improvise something.

54:04.735 --> 54:05.855
Come on, start seducing me.

54:05.895 --> 54:06.735
No...

54:06.735 --> 54:08.335
Come on, do it by staring at me.

54:08.375 --> 54:10.215
I can't do it just like that.

54:10.255 --> 54:10.975
Go ahead.

54:16.895 --> 54:17.775
Come on.

54:17.815 --> 54:19.415
I just started.

54:20.055 --> 54:20.655
I'm sorry.

54:26.775 --> 54:27.695
Show me how you do it.

54:29.215 --> 54:30.375
- Show me.
- Alright.

55:00.135 --> 55:01.055
What's wrong Irene?

55:02.295 --> 55:03.455
Nothing.
I...

55:10.575 --> 55:11.535
I had...

55:20.655 --> 55:21.535
I want to...

55:29.295 --> 55:30.175
I'd like to...

55:31.975 --> 55:33.335
What do you want?
What would you like?

55:33.415 --> 55:35.015
This is what makes the
other person go crazy.

55:35.055 --> 55:36.095
Not finishing your sentences.

55:36.735 --> 55:38.735
As if the rest is too painful to say.

55:39.415 --> 55:41.815
Not finishing your sentences
is very effective.

55:41.815 --> 55:43.855
That and looking ahead and afar.

55:43.895 --> 55:44.615
That'll get her.

55:44.655 --> 55:45.695
Look.

55:48.335 --> 55:49.095
I'm here...

55:54.055 --> 55:55.015
and I'm gone.

55:57.855 --> 55:59.135
And you have nice arms.

56:00.375 --> 56:01.295
You should show them.

56:05.215 --> 56:06.255
And you have nice hands.

56:30.495 --> 56:31.335
What is that?

56:31.415 --> 56:33.375
Damn... my watch's alarm.
She finished her meeting.

56:33.895 --> 56:34.615
She set an alarm?

56:34.615 --> 56:35.255
I have to go.

56:35.295 --> 56:37.015
I can't believe it!
You aren't listening to me!

56:37.015 --> 56:37.415
I am.

56:37.455 --> 56:38.055
And?

56:38.735 --> 56:40.095
I can't change everything right away.

56:40.535 --> 56:41.415
I have to go slowly.

56:42.095 --> 56:42.655
Dammit...

56:43.255 --> 56:44.375
Give me that.
I know what to do.

56:44.415 --> 56:45.135
You have to press...

56:47.255 --> 56:47.975
There we go.

56:50.735 --> 56:51.495
Why did you do that?

56:51.535 --> 56:52.455
Because.

56:53.255 --> 56:55.415
That was the end of our lesson
about the secret of womanhood.

56:55.655 --> 56:56.495
Go.

56:57.015 --> 56:58.335
Go or you'll be late.

57:45.575 --> 57:47.575
PLASTIC SURGEON

57:47.615 --> 57:48.615
This is ridiculous.

57:48.855 --> 57:49.815
You don't need this.

57:50.375 --> 57:52.295
You look very good.
You have no business being here.

57:52.375 --> 57:53.935
Thank you, Jean.
That's nice of you.

57:53.975 --> 57:57.215
I have no business being here,
because I come here regularly.

58:00.815 --> 58:01.455
Hello.

58:01.575 --> 58:03.375
Is everything alright
since your last visit?

58:03.415 --> 58:04.255
Better and better.

58:04.455 --> 58:05.095
Thanks.

58:05.455 --> 58:06.335
Thank you.

58:06.655 --> 58:08.375
I'm really happy with the result.

58:08.495 --> 58:09.375
Me too.

58:09.695 --> 58:10.295
Good.

58:11.975 --> 58:13.415
So what's the matter with that ear?

58:32.535 --> 58:33.815
That guy is the best.

58:34.215 --> 58:36.535
Do you know what I had to do
to set up this appointment?

58:37.015 --> 58:39.575
Do you know how long you have
to wait sometimes for breast surgery?

58:39.615 --> 58:41.535
No. Is that the next procedure
you're planning for me?

58:41.535 --> 58:42.135
Oh come on.

58:42.335 --> 58:44.415
That was nothing.
A single stitch and 20 minutes.

58:45.215 --> 58:46.975
Do you know what you
have to go through sometimes?

58:47.015 --> 58:48.095
I can imagine.

59:01.055 --> 59:02.055
Jean, stop it.

59:03.735 --> 59:05.815
Say something.
This silence makes me anxious.

59:10.815 --> 59:11.895
I want to...

59:16.855 --> 59:18.295
I'd like to...

59:23.215 --> 59:24.255
What do you want?
What?

59:24.375 --> 59:25.255
What would you like?

59:26.055 --> 59:27.135
What do you want?

59:28.495 --> 59:31.135
It's...
It's just...

59:31.975 --> 59:33.895
Jean, look at your watch.

59:33.935 --> 59:34.935
It's broken.

59:35.655 --> 59:38.295
Driver take us to number 63.

01:00:06.855 --> 01:00:08.215
The handle is made from shark bone.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.175
Amazing, isn't it?

01:00:10.815 --> 01:00:12.135
The bones are dried for 2 years.

01:00:12.975 --> 01:00:15.775
It takes one shark to
make one set of cutlery.

01:00:16.215 --> 01:00:19.575
Once I'm dead I'll donate
my body to them.

01:00:21.655 --> 01:00:22.935
Excuse me.

01:00:24.175 --> 01:00:25.215
- Do you have a light?
- Yes.

01:00:32.055 --> 01:00:33.135
Thank you.

01:00:35.775 --> 01:00:37.815
Do you think they sell it
at the hotel's boutique?

01:00:38.055 --> 01:00:38.975
The watch?

01:00:39.095 --> 01:00:40.935
No.
The cutlery.

01:00:42.135 --> 01:00:44.215
Yes.
Of course.

01:00:45.495 --> 01:00:47.575
I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

01:00:57.775 --> 01:00:58.575
Show me it.

01:01:00.135 --> 01:01:02.135
Oh my goodness.
A Jaeger-LeCoultre watch.

01:01:02.175 --> 01:01:03.175
Do know how much it's worth?

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.255
I can't even pronounce
such an amount.

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.335
You had a slow start,
but now you're rolling.

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:08.455
All this is white gold.

01:01:08.495 --> 01:01:09.575
With diamonds all around.

01:01:09.895 --> 01:01:11.295
And there's a diamond
on each number.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:13.495
And inside there are rubies
and other stuff.

01:01:13.935 --> 01:01:15.455
This isn't a watch.
It's a treasure chest.

01:01:15.495 --> 01:01:16.935
What did you do to her?

01:01:17.615 --> 01:01:18.775
I gave her the silent treatment.

01:01:21.975 --> 01:01:23.055
You look nice.

01:01:23.935 --> 01:01:25.455
Every rich guy looks nice to you.

01:01:25.895 --> 01:01:28.135
You're not rich.
You've barely begun to be rich.

01:01:28.175 --> 01:01:29.655
I never could have
expected any of this.

01:01:29.695 --> 01:01:31.695
Go first.
I'll follow you.

01:01:33.775 --> 01:01:35.055
- Jean?
- Yes?

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.015
What time is it?

01:01:43.095 --> 01:01:44.335
A quarter to 9.

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:00.535
- It's nice here, isn't it?
- Yes.

01:02:01.935 --> 01:02:05.175
I like this place because
it's not pretentious.

01:02:06.135 --> 01:02:07.615
It's calm and grand
at the same time.

01:02:07.655 --> 01:02:09.335
We have the impression
we're unique, don't we?

01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:10.375
Yes.

01:02:12.175 --> 01:02:13.695
The handle is made from shark bone.

01:02:14.855 --> 01:02:15.855
Amazing, isn't it?

01:02:17.095 --> 01:02:18.575
The bones are dried for 2 years.

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:25.455
It takes one shark to
make one set of cutlery.

01:02:34.095 --> 01:02:36.015
Good evening, sir.
This is François from room service.

01:02:36.055 --> 01:02:37.095
I'm sorry to disturb you.

01:02:37.135 --> 01:02:38.255
We're unsure of something.

01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:40.575
I need to clarify something
concerning your breakfast.

01:02:41.495 --> 01:02:42.975
The juice that you ordered.

01:02:43.015 --> 01:02:44.615
Should it be orange
or grapefruit?

01:02:44.735 --> 01:02:45.575
Orange.

01:02:45.615 --> 01:02:46.975
- Orange?
- Yes.

01:02:47.575 --> 01:02:50.015
Maltaise, Navelle or Sanguine?

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:50.735
What?

01:02:50.775 --> 01:02:52.055
Do you prefer a certain brand?

01:02:52.215 --> 01:02:53.055
A what?

01:02:53.095 --> 01:02:54.615
The brand of the juice.

01:02:55.255 --> 01:02:57.095
- Maltaise.
- Excellent choice, sir.

01:02:57.135 --> 01:02:58.295
We also have apple juice.

01:02:58.735 --> 01:03:01.655
A very popular apple juice.
It's very much in demand.

01:03:02.655 --> 01:03:04.695
It has a delicate flavor,
but has character.

01:03:05.375 --> 01:03:06.255
Thank you very much.

01:03:06.295 --> 01:03:07.855
Very well.

01:03:16.935 --> 01:03:18.575
Sir, this is François again
from room service.

01:03:18.615 --> 01:03:20.135
I'm sorry to be bothering you again.

01:03:20.455 --> 01:03:21.215
Regarding the eggs.

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:25.935
Should they be soft-cooked,
hard-cooked, fried or boiled?

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:27.335
Soft-cooked.

01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:29.375
Very well.

01:03:30.895 --> 01:03:31.855
A very good choice.

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:33.815
- Anything else?
- No.

01:03:33.855 --> 01:03:34.775
Are you sure, sir?

01:03:35.535 --> 01:03:36.175
Fine.

01:03:36.215 --> 01:03:40.095
Starting from a certain age,
a little ginseng added to your tea

01:03:40.135 --> 01:03:41.735
improves blood circulation.

01:03:41.775 --> 01:03:44.735
And I've also heard of
spectacular erections.

01:03:47.015 --> 01:03:48.175
Is this room service?

01:03:48.615 --> 01:03:50.335
Yes, this is room service.

01:03:50.375 --> 01:03:51.135
Is this a joke?

01:03:51.735 --> 01:03:52.895
Yes.. I mean, no.

01:03:53.015 --> 01:03:54.295
No, this is not a joke, sir.

01:03:54.335 --> 01:03:55.455
This is room service.

01:04:01.575 --> 01:04:03.455
Have you been told about
the food for seniors?

01:04:03.495 --> 01:04:04.095
No.

01:04:04.695 --> 01:04:08.935
The food for seniors
is specially prepared

01:04:08.975 --> 01:04:11.135
for our older clients.

01:04:11.175 --> 01:04:14.655
There's nothing to chew.

01:04:16.415 --> 01:04:20.495
The food is mechanically
chewed prior to serving,

01:04:20.535 --> 01:04:25.055
so that you may enjoy
every kind of food,

01:04:25.215 --> 01:04:27.775
in spite of a disability
of the jaw.

01:04:28.255 --> 01:04:31.295
I can offer you soup,
purée and yogurt.

01:04:33.775 --> 01:04:35.495
And stewed fruit for dessert.

01:04:50.175 --> 01:04:51.295
Where were you?

01:04:51.735 --> 01:04:52.655
I went to the bathroom.

01:04:53.255 --> 01:04:55.415
Two visits to the bathroom
during a meal at your age?

01:04:56.375 --> 01:04:57.655
I'm sorry... I...

01:04:59.455 --> 01:05:00.375
What were you doing?

01:05:00.695 --> 01:05:01.815
Were you talking to someone?

01:05:02.175 --> 01:05:03.215
No.

01:05:03.535 --> 01:05:04.575
You can tell me.

01:05:05.015 --> 01:05:05.895
No.

01:05:06.575 --> 01:05:08.695
You weren't talking to anyone
or you don't want to tell me?

01:05:09.175 --> 01:05:11.495
I'm not jealous just curious.

01:05:17.535 --> 01:05:18.615
I...

01:05:21.775 --> 01:05:23.255
What's wrong, Jean?

01:05:23.375 --> 01:05:24.695
Nothing... I...

01:05:26.615 --> 01:05:27.775
I want to...

01:05:29.615 --> 01:05:30.975
I'd like to...

01:05:32.615 --> 01:05:33.895
Enough of this.

01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:36.135
What do you think you're doing?

01:05:37.215 --> 01:05:38.855
That you can play games with me

01:05:38.895 --> 01:05:40.255
like with a young virgin?

01:05:42.535 --> 01:05:43.895
Listen to me carefully, my boy.

01:05:44.495 --> 01:05:46.255
If I want to I can
throw you out of here

01:05:46.295 --> 01:05:47.815
with one snap of my fingers.

01:05:49.015 --> 01:05:52.015
So if you want to continue
to enjoy the pool and the boutiques,

01:05:53.135 --> 01:05:55.295
then you better show
some more concentration.

01:05:57.135 --> 01:05:58.255
Do you understand?

01:07:01.335 --> 01:07:02.575
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:07:03.935 --> 01:07:05.255
We visited the boutiques.

01:07:13.175 --> 01:07:14.975
- She bought you a scooter?
- Yes.

01:07:15.295 --> 01:07:16.455
It has a luggage box.

01:07:17.055 --> 01:07:18.095
And a full tank.

01:07:19.655 --> 01:07:20.815
We can go for a swim.

01:07:21.695 --> 01:07:22.935
I know this nice place by the sea.

01:07:22.975 --> 01:07:24.735
I've been wanting to go
there since arriving here.

01:07:24.895 --> 01:07:25.895
We'll go there now.

01:07:27.495 --> 01:07:28.935
Order me a glass and
I'll be right back.

01:07:44.295 --> 01:07:45.895
We made a good choice
by picking this suit.

01:07:45.935 --> 01:07:46.735
It's very nice.

01:08:07.855 --> 01:08:09.135
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:08:24.175 --> 01:08:25.255
You were right.

01:08:25.255 --> 01:08:27.814
It's good to go to bed early.

01:08:36.055 --> 01:08:38.935
It was nice of you to cancel
our dinner at the restaurant.

01:08:39.095 --> 01:08:39.895
Really?

01:08:40.095 --> 01:08:43.175
Yes. It's as if you gave me a gift.

01:08:45.135 --> 01:08:47.255
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

01:08:54.055 --> 01:08:55.694
You're really not hungry this evening?

01:08:56.895 --> 01:08:57.734
No I'm not.

01:08:58.135 --> 01:08:59.295
That's something rare, isn't it?

01:09:00.215 --> 01:09:00.975
That's true.

01:09:09.575 --> 01:09:10.895
Do you want some candy?

01:09:11.935 --> 01:09:12.935
No, thank you.

01:09:13.935 --> 01:09:16.375
I own some of the producer's stock.
It makes me good money.

01:09:29.495 --> 01:09:30.654
Where are you from?

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:33.255
Excuse me?

01:09:33.415 --> 01:09:34.694
Where are you from?

01:09:34.854 --> 01:09:35.774
I'm from Saint-Brieux.

01:09:35.814 --> 01:09:36.895
Saint-Brieux?

01:09:42.135 --> 01:09:43.175
Is it nice there?

01:09:45.175 --> 01:09:46.095
It rains all the time.

01:09:50.335 --> 01:09:53.135
Do you know that I haven't
seen the rain in 4 years?

01:09:54.935 --> 01:09:56.055
It's always summer here.

01:09:59.255 --> 01:10:01.175
I miss the smell of rain.

01:10:13.815 --> 01:10:15.095
Do you have any siblings?

01:10:19.775 --> 01:10:20.535
No.

01:10:23.415 --> 01:10:25.655
I have 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:27.375
And my oldest sister
would always tease me.

01:10:27.855 --> 01:10:28.895
I mean that...

01:11:40.495 --> 01:11:41.495
You haven't said anything.

01:11:42.055 --> 01:11:43.655
It's very nice here.

01:11:45.015 --> 01:11:46.175
I lack the words to describe it.

01:11:49.695 --> 01:11:51.495
Behind us is an abandoned vineyard.

01:11:52.215 --> 01:11:54.175
I find grapes there in September.

01:11:55.815 --> 01:11:57.215
And up there, to your left...

01:11:58.095 --> 01:11:59.335
There's an old sheep house.

01:11:59.455 --> 01:12:00.295
Do you see it?

01:12:00.495 --> 01:12:02.135
I can barely see my sandwich.

01:12:30.975 --> 01:12:32.295
Dammit.
Impossible.

01:13:54.895 --> 01:13:55.815
Jean, excuse me.

01:13:55.855 --> 01:13:58.695
It would be lovely if you could
bring me my book from our room.

01:14:11.535 --> 01:14:12.495
Irene?

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:14.535
Is everything alright?

01:14:16.175 --> 01:14:18.375
I wanted to tell you that
I spent a wonderful night.

01:14:19.775 --> 01:14:20.735
Me too.

01:14:21.975 --> 01:14:23.095
When can we do it again?

01:14:25.655 --> 01:14:27.255
I didn't want to
fall asleep, you know.

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.735
So that I could savor each minute.

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:34.015
What's wrong?

01:14:40.575 --> 01:14:41.415
I'm leaving.

01:14:43.855 --> 01:14:44.935
I came to say good bye.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:48.655
Where to?

01:14:50.335 --> 01:14:51.415
I'm going to Venice.

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:53.495
With Gilles.

01:14:54.215 --> 01:14:55.455
And then to the Maldives.

01:14:58.935 --> 01:14:59.775
When?

01:15:01.935 --> 01:15:02.895
This evening.

01:15:07.495 --> 01:15:08.455
When are you coming back?

01:15:10.335 --> 01:15:11.215
I'm not coming back.

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:17.855
When I was a kid I went to
Venice once with my parents.

01:15:19.655 --> 01:15:23.135
I remember the bread rolls
they had there. I adored them.

01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:26.975
I don't remember their name.

01:15:30.015 --> 01:15:31.015
Do you know which ones?

01:15:31.015 --> 01:15:32.135
Yes.

01:15:33.055 --> 01:15:34.695
I also don't remember their name.

01:15:36.775 --> 01:15:38.055
And I also adore them.

01:15:45.255 --> 01:15:46.655
So... good bye.

01:16:21.935 --> 01:16:23.175
Jean, are you here?

01:16:50.775 --> 01:16:51.575
Here you are.

01:16:52.535 --> 01:16:53.335
Is everything alright?

01:16:53.695 --> 01:16:54.375
Yes.

01:16:55.335 --> 01:16:56.215
The book was here.

01:16:56.655 --> 01:16:57.535
Thank you.

01:16:59.935 --> 01:17:03.895
Madeleine, what's the name of
those Italian bread rolls?

01:17:14.495 --> 01:17:15.255
Oh no...

01:17:15.455 --> 01:17:16.535
Oh no, this can't be true...

01:17:16.575 --> 01:17:18.135
That bastard...
Not again...

01:17:24.735 --> 01:17:25.855
Dammit...

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.735
The bread rolls are called panettones.

01:17:53.295 --> 01:17:54.455
That idiot dumped me.

01:17:55.095 --> 01:17:56.015
He dumped you?

01:17:57.055 --> 01:17:57.975
He left me here.

01:17:58.415 --> 01:17:59.335
And took everything.

01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:00.055
But why?

01:18:00.495 --> 01:18:01.375
And what do you think?

01:18:01.935 --> 01:18:02.855
Do you think he saw us?

01:18:02.895 --> 01:18:04.055
Of course he saw us.

01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:07.095
I can't believe it.
I'm so stupid.

01:18:08.495 --> 01:18:09.815
You have to go to the train station.

01:18:11.015 --> 01:18:12.815
I keep my things there
in a luggage box.

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:14.535
Dammit... I have nothing.

01:18:15.255 --> 01:18:18.535
I only have this cover
and the swimming suit.

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:40.975
Miss?

01:19:41.775 --> 01:19:42.695
This is for you.

01:19:53.335 --> 01:19:54.935
The room has been paid
for the whole week.

01:19:58.255 --> 01:19:59.375
Are you alright?

01:19:59.415 --> 01:20:00.255
Yes.
I'm fine.

01:20:02.055 --> 01:20:03.295
You look a little nervous.

01:20:03.335 --> 01:20:04.295
No, I'm not nervous.

01:20:06.855 --> 01:20:07.775
What will you have?

01:20:08.295 --> 01:20:09.215
I'll have a vodka.

01:20:09.255 --> 01:20:11.535
We'll have a scotch
whisky and a vodka.

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:13.855
Where's your watch?

01:20:16.055 --> 01:20:16.855
I sold it.

01:20:19.255 --> 01:20:20.615
That's not true.
It's in our room.

01:20:21.175 --> 01:20:22.815
No, I sold it at the same boutique.

01:20:24.855 --> 01:20:25.535
But...

01:20:25.575 --> 01:20:26.695
It was mine, wasn't it?

01:20:28.775 --> 01:20:29.575
Yes.

01:20:37.135 --> 01:20:39.095
I wanted to believe
you're a little different.

01:20:39.455 --> 01:20:40.695
Not like the others.

01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:43.375
But you're only more
clever than they are.

01:20:44.055 --> 01:20:45.255
I don't know what came over me.

01:20:46.655 --> 01:20:48.495
I wanted to buy you a gift,
but I had no money.

01:20:50.855 --> 01:20:52.975
So... here you go.

01:20:58.295 --> 01:20:59.535
They're gorgeous.

01:21:05.895 --> 01:21:07.295
This is charming, Jean.

01:21:08.895 --> 01:21:10.855
That watch was the
only thing you had.

01:21:30.695 --> 01:21:32.535
I'm sure I gave you the invitation.

01:21:33.295 --> 01:21:36.055
No. The invitation was
on your nightstand.

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:39.295
Most likely the cleaning
lady took it.

01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:40.695
It doesn't matter.

01:22:28.775 --> 01:22:29.855
Excuse me.

01:22:30.495 --> 01:22:31.735
Do you have a light?

01:23:11.095 --> 01:23:12.775
Can I bring you some champagne?

01:23:12.815 --> 01:23:13.975
That would be charming.

01:23:39.335 --> 01:23:40.535
5 glasses, please.

01:24:23.535 --> 01:24:24.455
Thank you.

01:24:49.175 --> 01:24:50.255
You're a prince.

01:25:11.335 --> 01:25:12.895
I will be needing your help, Jean.

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:14.215
Of course. How can I help?

01:25:16.095 --> 01:25:17.255
I saw Jacques.

01:25:19.695 --> 01:25:20.695
You need to help me.

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:21.655
In what way?

01:25:22.935 --> 01:25:23.975
I want you to help me...

01:25:25.735 --> 01:25:26.695
seduce him.

01:25:31.135 --> 01:25:32.735
Things can't go on like this, Jean.

01:25:33.935 --> 01:25:35.535
That situation at the
pool was just too hard.

01:25:35.575 --> 01:25:37.495
I don't want to find myself
without anything again.

01:25:38.775 --> 01:25:39.575
I prefer to...

01:25:39.615 --> 01:25:40.775
What do you want me to do?

01:25:43.335 --> 01:25:44.335
Tell me.

01:26:01.255 --> 01:26:02.055
Excuse me.

01:26:02.095 --> 01:26:03.495
A glass of champagne, please.

01:26:05.615 --> 01:26:06.895
One for you?

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:07.975
Yes.

01:26:08.095 --> 01:26:09.535
One more glass, please.

01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:11.095
Thank you.

01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:13.895
Getting some champagne is real madness.

01:26:14.135 --> 01:26:15.015
When did you arrive?

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:16.575
About 10 minutes ago.

01:26:16.895 --> 01:26:17.655
Are you alone?

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:19.415
Yes, for now.

01:26:19.855 --> 01:26:21.535
- And you?
- No.

01:26:23.975 --> 01:26:25.295
Here's to our health.

01:26:26.095 --> 01:26:27.335
- Irene.
- Agnes.

01:26:31.935 --> 01:26:33.055
Impossible...

01:26:33.335 --> 01:26:33.975
What?

01:26:34.855 --> 01:26:36.255
This is my lucky day.

01:26:36.535 --> 01:26:37.335
What is it?

01:26:37.895 --> 01:26:39.615
- The Prince von Hoffenberg.
- Who?

01:26:39.975 --> 01:26:42.335
The Prince von Hoffenberg.
There, near the roses.

01:26:42.895 --> 01:26:43.815
Who is he?

01:26:44.375 --> 01:26:45.655
A mover and shaker of this world.

01:26:47.215 --> 01:26:48.575
He's a Dutch nobleman.

01:26:48.815 --> 01:26:50.855
And he's an industrial tycoon.

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:53.575
He must have just arrived.

01:26:55.055 --> 01:26:56.055
He's very rich

01:26:56.735 --> 01:26:57.695
and very lonely.

01:26:58.735 --> 01:27:01.055
He lost his wife in
a car accident 2 years ago.

01:27:01.695 --> 01:27:03.455
And since then he's
in such a poor shape.

01:27:06.135 --> 01:27:07.575
I'll go to him
and take my chances.

01:27:07.935 --> 01:27:09.095
Excuse me.

01:27:16.935 --> 01:27:17.935
Is it at her you're looking?

01:27:19.455 --> 01:27:20.255
Yes.

01:27:20.975 --> 01:27:22.015
Is she looking at you?

01:27:22.055 --> 01:27:24.935
Yes. She's taking shy
glances at me.

01:27:25.455 --> 01:27:26.615
She wants to get married.

01:27:27.415 --> 01:27:28.295
Here you go.

01:27:28.615 --> 01:27:29.935
I noticed you hadn't any left.

01:27:31.095 --> 01:27:31.935
Thank you.

01:27:32.135 --> 01:27:33.095
Good evening.

01:27:34.295 --> 01:27:35.615
This is Agnes, my friend.

01:27:36.695 --> 01:27:38.655
- Prince Michel...
- ...von Hoffenberg.

01:27:38.855 --> 01:27:39.575
Of course.

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:41.815
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:27:42.415 --> 01:27:43.535
I'm rarely recognized.

01:27:43.895 --> 01:27:46.095
But you have a face
that's impossible to forget.

01:27:47.975 --> 01:27:48.975
Have you just arrived?

01:27:48.855 --> 01:27:50.335
I don't intend to
stay here too long.

01:27:50.375 --> 01:27:52.495
- I think this is a little...
- Yes, that's true.

01:27:52.535 --> 01:27:53.295
You think the same?

01:27:57.655 --> 01:28:00.255
I couldn't help myself from
looking at you all evening.

01:28:00.295 --> 01:28:00.935
I'm sorry.

01:28:01.775 --> 01:28:02.775
No need to be sorry.

01:28:04.055 --> 01:28:05.415
You remind me of someone.

01:28:06.295 --> 01:28:07.455
The Princess of Edinburgh.

01:28:09.335 --> 01:28:10.895
- Excuse me, Ines.
- Irene.

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:12.415
I'm sorry.

01:28:12.455 --> 01:28:14.575
Don't mention it.
Maybe we can see each other later?

01:28:16.775 --> 01:28:19.575
I have her portrait, painted by
Rembrandt, at my country house.

01:28:21.455 --> 01:28:22.615
I hung it in the guest room.

01:28:24.415 --> 01:28:25.655
I'd like to show it to you.

01:28:26.175 --> 01:28:27.255
The resemblance is striking.

01:28:28.815 --> 01:28:30.895
She was executed during the revolution.

01:28:30.935 --> 01:28:32.815
Oh my God...
I'm so sorry.

01:28:33.375 --> 01:28:34.455
The pain has passed.

01:28:38.455 --> 01:28:39.975
Excuse me for a moment.

01:28:43.775 --> 01:28:45.935
You're behaving like a rude bastard.

01:28:46.095 --> 01:28:48.375
For the past hour you've been
going from one woman to the next.

01:28:49.055 --> 01:28:50.655
What are you doing?
Who do you think you are?

01:28:51.295 --> 01:28:52.655
Do you think a little
jewel is enough?

01:28:52.695 --> 01:28:53.575
I'm sorry, Madeleine.

01:28:53.655 --> 01:28:55.095
I don't give a damn
that you're sorry.

01:28:55.135 --> 01:28:57.575
You told my friends you'll
bring us some champagne, so do it.

01:28:57.615 --> 01:28:58.855
You have 2 minutes to bring it.

01:28:58.895 --> 01:29:00.815
I'd be happy to help, but I can't.

01:29:01.495 --> 01:29:02.495
What do you mean you can't?

01:29:04.055 --> 01:29:06.615
I need to go to the hotel and
spend a few hours with this girl.

01:29:08.495 --> 01:29:09.495
What are you talking about?

01:29:09.735 --> 01:29:11.295
I need to do a favor.
I can't do otherwise.

01:29:11.775 --> 01:29:12.775
Are you kidding me?

01:29:12.815 --> 01:29:13.415
I'm warning you.

01:29:13.455 --> 01:29:16.015
If you leave with that girl,
don't count on me, understand?

01:29:16.895 --> 01:29:19.455
I'll leave the scooter at the
parking lot and the keys at reception.

01:29:25.455 --> 01:29:27.055
There's nothing I can
do to stop you?

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:27.895
No.

01:29:30.775 --> 01:29:31.455
I'm sorry.

01:29:31.495 --> 01:29:33.375
Stop being so nice.
It's unbearable.

01:29:35.655 --> 01:29:37.775
It seems that a man
like you can't be bought.

01:29:37.935 --> 01:29:38.855
Even by me.

01:29:41.975 --> 01:29:43.975
I'll be fine, don't worry.
You're not the first.

01:29:44.015 --> 01:29:45.535
Thank you for approaching
things this way.

01:29:46.695 --> 01:29:48.015
Do I have a choice?

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:55.215
You can keep the scooter.

01:29:55.655 --> 01:29:56.735
You deserve it.

01:30:06.575 --> 01:30:07.495
I'm sorry...

01:30:08.415 --> 01:30:09.575
That was my ex mother-in-law.

01:30:10.055 --> 01:30:11.455
The Baroness von Bosten.

01:30:11.495 --> 01:30:13.615
She can't stand that
I talk to other women since...

01:30:13.655 --> 01:30:14.335
Yes.

01:30:14.495 --> 01:30:15.295
I know.

01:30:19.215 --> 01:30:20.415
Don't hold it against her.

01:30:20.455 --> 01:30:21.575
She's suffering because of it.

01:30:22.055 --> 01:30:23.495
But I have to live on, right?

01:30:23.735 --> 01:30:25.975
Yes, of course.
One must live on.

01:30:26.535 --> 01:30:27.655
Life goes on.

01:30:32.255 --> 01:30:33.095
Are you alright?

01:30:33.255 --> 01:30:35.375
No...
Yes.

01:30:36.855 --> 01:30:37.735
I want to...

01:30:38.495 --> 01:30:39.455
I'd like to...

01:31:20.335 --> 01:31:21.415
Well well.

01:31:21.895 --> 01:31:22.855
Good evening, Jacques.

01:31:23.055 --> 01:31:24.295
Good evening, Irene.

01:31:24.455 --> 01:31:26.815
You see. I still
remember your name.

01:31:28.095 --> 01:31:28.855
Are you alone?

01:31:29.295 --> 01:31:30.095
As you can see.

01:31:45.055 --> 01:31:46.975
What have you been doing?

01:31:47.255 --> 01:31:48.375
I've been signing checks.

01:31:49.535 --> 01:31:50.375
When did you arrive?

01:31:52.095 --> 01:31:54.775
I arrived this morning.
I was dumped this evening.

01:31:55.935 --> 01:31:57.175
Not all is lost.

01:31:58.775 --> 01:31:59.535
It seems so.

01:32:04.855 --> 01:32:07.735
I think I've already
forgotten her name.

01:32:09.895 --> 01:32:11.055
Excuse me.
What did you say?

01:32:11.575 --> 01:32:13.735
That I've already
forgotten her name.

01:32:16.135 --> 01:32:17.055
Agnes.

01:32:17.655 --> 01:32:18.575
You know her?

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:21.815
Small world.

01:32:23.535 --> 01:32:24.815
Are you alright?

01:32:26.855 --> 01:32:28.855
Yes. I'm fine.

01:32:29.775 --> 01:32:32.015
Do you have any plans
for the coming days?

01:32:34.375 --> 01:32:35.535
Do you have any plans?

01:32:36.815 --> 01:32:37.575
Excuse me?

01:32:38.855 --> 01:32:41.855
I have this impression
your thoughts are elsewhere.

01:32:42.495 --> 01:32:44.015
And I don't like it.

01:32:45.815 --> 01:32:46.695
Excuse me.

01:32:47.015 --> 01:32:47.775
Pardon me.

01:32:47.975 --> 01:32:49.895
It's the alcohol and the fatigue.

01:32:51.255 --> 01:32:52.375
I'm falling asleep.

01:32:53.535 --> 01:32:54.455
What were you saying?

01:32:55.215 --> 01:32:56.895
I asked if you had any plans.

01:32:59.815 --> 01:33:01.655
What are you plans
for the coming days?

01:33:07.895 --> 01:33:08.815
Love.

01:33:12.815 --> 01:33:14.055
I plan to make love.

01:33:15.935 --> 01:33:16.895
Excuse me.

01:33:17.695 --> 01:33:18.575
Excuse me, Jacques.

01:33:18.975 --> 01:33:19.775
I'm sorry.

01:33:21.335 --> 01:33:22.095
Excuse me.

01:33:23.495 --> 01:33:24.735
I'm really sorry.

01:34:20.055 --> 01:34:21.895
Prince?
What's going on?

01:34:24.215 --> 01:34:25.415
What are you doing here?

01:34:25.455 --> 01:34:26.415
I'm doing you a favor.

01:34:27.255 --> 01:34:28.295
He's not a prince.

01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:38.215
I can't believe it.

01:34:39.375 --> 01:34:40.095
Excuse me.

01:34:42.055 --> 01:34:42.935
Well...

01:34:43.655 --> 01:34:44.695
It took you a while.

01:34:46.015 --> 01:34:47.135
I did what I could.

01:34:57.735 --> 01:34:58.895
I want to...
