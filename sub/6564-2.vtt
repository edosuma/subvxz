00:04.500 --> 00:06.600
I don't get it.
We bust our butts every week

00:06.630 --> 00:08.530
and instead of rewarding us
with the opening number,

00:08.560 --> 00:10.900
Gary gives it to some no-name
dance crew off of the street!

00:10.930 --> 00:13.800
I know. If he wanted no-names,
he could have just gone with us.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.700
- So not cool.
- So not cool.

00:17.730 --> 00:19.500
So not cool.

00:19.930 --> 00:22.630
I say off with Gary's head!

00:23.730 --> 00:26.470
Relax, it's just an expression.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.530
Okay.

00:27.570 --> 00:28.840
In this country.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.870
You know what?
We should protest.

00:32.910 --> 00:34.870
Sign a petition.
Stage a walkout.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.640
Or, we hit him where it really hurts.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.610
Hide his hair spray.
Yeah! Yeah!

00:39.640 --> 00:42.710
No, the three of us are going
to march into Gary's office

00:42.750 --> 00:45.480
and demand that he fire
that lame dance crew.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.450
Let's do it! Okay!
I like that.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.580
<i>Hola, chicas.</i>

00:50.920 --> 00:52.520
Hey!

00:55.820 --> 00:58.830
Well, on the other hand,
we're all dancers here.

00:58.860 --> 01:00.460
We should support one another.

01:00.490 --> 01:01.900
Absolutely.
It's the nice thing to do.

I gotta run.

03:07.340 --> 03:10.070
I gotta go get to the
library before it closes.

03:10.110 --> 03:11.180
Oh, Cece, I'm really impressed.

03:11.210 --> 03:13.210
You're really studying hard.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.380
No, I just left my phone there.

03:16.050 --> 03:19.120
In that case, I'm just
where the library is.

Actually, the tag
"property of Rocky Blue."

03:31.190 --> 03:33.190
Great.

03:33.230 --> 03:36.060
I am Julio Roberto Torres.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.300
Wow. I love your accent.

03:37.330 --> 03:39.330
Please keep talking.
 Please?

03:41.100 --> 03:42.240
You're funny.

03:42.270 --> 03:44.340
Hey, I just moved from Miami to Chicago.

03:44.370 --> 03:47.040
Tell me, <i>chica,</i> <i>what's your
favorite</i> <i>pizza place?</i>

03:47.080 --> 03:48.210
Oh! Crusty's on Third.
They're amazing.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.050
Let me write down the address for you.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.410
Or we can save a tree
and you can meet me there.

03:52.450 --> 03:55.480
Oh. Yeah. I'm totally about saving
our natural resources, too.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.290
I think it's really important that...

03:57.320 --> 04:00.220
Wait a minute.

04:00.260 --> 04:02.190
Did you just ask me to have
pizza with your accent?

04:04.060 --> 04:06.360
I mean you.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.300
How's Monday after school?

04:08.330 --> 04:10.230
Sounds good.
See you at Crusty's.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.110
I just had my first

04:17.140 --> 04:18.410
and second kiss.

04:25.020 --> 04:27.080
I got it, Mom!

04:30.250 --> 04:31.450
Greetings, my one and only friend

04:31.490 --> 04:33.390
who doesn't have multiple graduate degrees

04:33.420 --> 04:36.060
framed and hanging on his wall.

04:36.090 --> 04:38.330
Hello, boy genius who is clearly delusional

04:38.360 --> 04:41.360
because I'm pretty sure I'm your
one and only friend, period.

04:45.100 --> 04:47.440
I hope you don't mind me just
showing up uninvited this way,

04:47.470 --> 04:51.040
but I really am under great duress
over my current predicament.

04:52.470 --> 04:55.040
English, Henry!
English!

04:56.250 --> 04:59.380
My dad wants me to spend more
time with kids my own age.

04:59.410 --> 05:03.120
I think he just wants you out of the house.

05:03.150 --> 05:06.350
But it's cool.
My mom wants me to do more charity work

05:06.390 --> 05:08.460
so make yourself comfortable.

05:13.460 --> 05:15.430
Oh, no, no, no!

05:16.430 --> 05:18.370
I'm so sorry I left you behind, baby.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.010
Momma will never do that again.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.210
Dude!
Watch where...

05:23.140 --> 05:26.180
Oh, hi! Hi!

05:26.210 --> 05:29.980
I'm so sorry I ran into you.
Totally my fault.

05:30.020 --> 05:31.350
I don't think we've met officially.

05:31.380 --> 05:34.390
I'm Cece and you're hot!

05:34.420 --> 05:38.020
<i>Hola,</i> Cece.
<i>Me llamo</i> Julio Roberto Torres.

05:38.060 --> 05:39.460
Oh. Nice to
meet you, Me Llamo.

05:42.030 --> 05:44.160
You're very funny.
I love funny people.

05:44.200 --> 05:48.000
So, Cece, I just heard about this
great new pizza place, Crusty's.

05:48.030 --> 05:50.330
Would you like to meet
there Monday after school?

05:50.370 --> 05:53.340
Well, as long as it's not a date,
'cause I'm not allowed to...

05:55.140 --> 05:56.340
Oh, who am I kidding?
See you then.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.110
Why did I have to meet you so early?

06:03.150 --> 06:05.250
I didn't even have time to do my hair.

06:09.150 --> 06:10.390
That's your bedhead?

06:10.420 --> 06:13.260
What, do you sleep standing up?

06:13.290 --> 06:16.430
Don't be fresh.
I washed and rinsed,

06:16.460 --> 06:19.970
but I didn't have time to repeat.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.440
Well, you still look good
and weird to me. Anyhoo.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.040
You're going to love this!

06:26.070 --> 06:28.040
Ta-da! I know
you've been dying

06:28.080 --> 06:30.310
to get your hands on
the Betwinkler X-96 Turbo,

06:30.350 --> 06:33.210
which can betwinkle fabric
from 20 feet away.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.450
But you should really read
the instruction booklet first

06:35.480 --> 06:37.380
because it can get a little...
Oh, my goodness.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.060
You're welcome, Principal Rabinoff.

06:48.370 --> 06:51.330
Sorry, Deuce.
Been there, betwinkled that.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.240
I got one two weeks ago.

06:53.270 --> 06:55.170
What?
That's impossible.

06:55.210 --> 06:57.070
There are only four of these in the world

06:57.110 --> 07:00.210
and three of them belong to
the U.S. figure skating team.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.150
Well, there must have been a fifth,

07:02.180 --> 07:04.980
because your girlfriend,
Dina, got it for me.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.280
Dina? But you're
my customer.

07:07.320 --> 07:10.190
Oh, I don't know what to say.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.090
Oh, wait, I do know what to say.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.020
Don't ever call me again.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.400
Hey, hey, hey.

07:19.430 --> 07:21.000
Oh, my gosh, Cece!
Oh, my gosh, Rocky!

07:21.030 --> 07:22.300
You'll never guess what happened to me!

07:22.330 --> 07:24.030
You first. Okay!

07:24.070 --> 07:26.000
I was at...

07:26.040 --> 07:27.270
Okay, stop, stop.
You go first.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.000
Okay, okay, okay.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.110
I was at <i>Shake It Up, Chicago!
</i> <i>Me, too.</i>

07:31.140 --> 07:33.380
And one of the cute guys from the
dance crew came over to talk to me.

07:33.410 --> 07:36.010
Me, too!

07:36.050 --> 07:38.980
And then he asked me to
go to pizza at Crusty's.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.020
Oh, that's great!
You have a date!

07:41.050 --> 07:43.990
Oh. And there was one more
thing I wanted to tell you.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.120
Me, too!

07:45.160 --> 07:48.060
We have dates!
I know!

07:48.090 --> 07:50.030
My guy, he cares about the environment

07:50.060 --> 07:51.290
and he's got the cutest accent.

07:51.330 --> 07:54.460
My guy is supercute and he
thinks that I'm really funny.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.430
Ooh! They're in
the same dance crew.

07:58.470 --> 08:00.970
We can all hang out together all the time.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.270
Yeah, and then one day
we'll go to prom together,

08:03.310 --> 08:05.270
and then we'll have a double wedding.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.140
And then we'll go on
our honeymoon together.

08:07.170 --> 08:10.110
And then, one day, we'll
get matching beach houses

08:10.140 --> 08:12.180
and matching French bulldogs.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.420
Slow down, Rocky.

08:15.450 --> 08:18.320
I never agreed to matching French bulldogs.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.020
I like Labradoodles!

08:29.470 --> 08:33.370
This is it. Mrs.
Tomkins is finally on maternity leave

08:33.400 --> 08:37.070
and we've got eight weeks
of substitute teachers!

08:37.110 --> 08:39.980
So, let's see if our months
of preparation has paid off.

08:40.010 --> 08:41.010
Textbooks, go!

08:43.450 --> 08:47.380
Sweet!
Good job, troops.

08:47.420 --> 08:50.390
Tack on the chair?
Check.

08:50.420 --> 08:53.390
Drawers glued shut?
Check.

08:55.130 --> 08:57.090
Apple juice on the floor to look like pee?

08:57.360 --> 08:58.500
Check.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.330
We're more than ready,
and I couldn't be prouder.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.970
Hello, class.
I'm your new substitute teacher.

09:08.010 --> 09:09.310
Henry?

09:09.340 --> 09:12.310
Oh, my. This is an
awkward turn of events.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.950
What are you doing here?

09:14.980 --> 09:17.080
I'm the new substitute teacher,

09:17.120 --> 09:20.150
and perhaps you should call me Mr.
Dillon in the classroom.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.350
Okay, Mr. Dillon.

09:21.390 --> 09:23.020
In the classroom!

09:27.160 --> 09:30.360
Dude, this is not good.
You need to go and request a transfer.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.300
But you and my dad both agreed that I need

09:32.330 --> 09:35.000
to spend time with kids my own age.

09:35.030 --> 09:39.070
So, just treat me like you would
treat any other substitute teacher.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.140
Are you sure about that?

09:40.170 --> 09:41.440
I'm positive.

09:41.470 --> 09:43.040
If you say so.

09:46.140 --> 09:49.210
Ready! Aim! Fire!

09:51.280 --> 09:52.450
Spitballs?

09:53.420 --> 09:55.150
Oh, what is that?

09:55.190 --> 09:57.320
Oh, no! I stepped in pee!
I stepped in pee!

09:59.090 --> 10:00.390
There's a towel in the supply cabinet!

10:05.030 --> 10:07.460
Welcome to Jackson
Elementary School, Henry.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.230
Oh, I mean, Mr. Dillon.

10:10.470 --> 10:12.440
In the classroom.

10:18.180 --> 10:19.210
Hey, Dina.

10:21.140 --> 10:24.050
There you are, baby.
I haven't seen you all day.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.120
I've missed you.

10:27.150 --> 10:31.290
Really? 'Cause you certainly haven't
missed any of my customers.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.060
What's that supposed to mean?

10:33.090 --> 10:34.320
Nothing. Nothing.

10:34.360 --> 10:37.330
Just my business has been
in the toilet lately.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.490
Oh, I think I got something for that.

10:41.430 --> 10:44.530
Look, it's got a motorized
head for big jobs.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.300
You're missing the point, sweetie.

10:50.340 --> 10:55.040
Look, it's cute that you do a little
business, unless it steps on mine.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.440
Oh, I get it.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.410
You want me to stop selling

10:58.450 --> 11:01.150
and instead be the cute,
supportive girlfriend

11:01.180 --> 11:04.350
who does her hair all nice and
bakes you cakes and stuff.

11:05.450 --> 11:09.060
Wow. It's like
you read my mind!

11:10.460 --> 11:12.390
And added cake!

11:13.460 --> 11:15.200
I was joking!

11:15.230 --> 11:17.030
Like I'd ever quit my business

11:17.070 --> 11:19.070
just because I'm doing better than you.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.300
And if you thought I was outselling
you before, just you wait.

11:22.340 --> 11:25.210
Now I'm gonna bury you.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.310
Yeah? Yeah?
Well, I hope you got a shovel!

11:28.350 --> 11:31.450
I don't!
I sold the last one to your mom!

11:40.190 --> 11:42.320
Wait, last minute breath check.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.230
Mmm! Minty.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.170
Hey! There's
my guy. Julio!

11:50.200 --> 11:53.240
No, that's my guy,
and his name is Me Llamo.

11:55.140 --> 11:58.470
Okay. First of all,
no one's name is "Me Llamo."

11:58.510 --> 12:00.310
His name is Julio.

12:01.380 --> 12:04.010
He lied to me about his name?

12:05.280 --> 12:08.990
Wait, I don't think we're on a double date.

12:09.020 --> 12:12.320
I think we're on the same date.
With the same guy.

12:13.720 --> 12:16.160
Do you think he thinks
we're the same person, too?

12:25.330 --> 12:27.070
Okay, I'll go get us some drinks.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.330
Okay, thank you so much.

12:29.370 --> 12:31.300
All right.
What the heck is going on?

12:32.470 --> 12:34.240
Why would he invite both of us?

12:34.270 --> 12:37.180
I don't know.
Maybe he likes us both

12:37.210 --> 12:39.380
but he's trying to figure out
which one of us he "like" likes.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.280
Okay, I got a plan.

12:42.310 --> 12:45.320
We'll both hang out with him till we figure
out which one of us he "like" likes.

12:45.350 --> 12:48.190
Then the other one will gracefully bow out.

12:48.220 --> 12:51.290
Okay. Sounds good.
So when it's clear that he "like" likes me,

12:51.320 --> 12:55.090
I'll give you this signal, you'll
find an excuse, and leave.

12:55.130 --> 12:56.230
Or...

12:57.430 --> 12:59.500
When it's clear that he "like" likes me

12:59.530 --> 13:03.070
I'll give you this signal
and you'll "leave" leave.

13:04.470 --> 13:06.270
Deal.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.440
Wait, should I change my secret signal?

13:09.470 --> 13:12.170
This doesn't look like I'm
picking my nose, does it?

13:14.140 --> 13:15.310
Not at all.

13:18.410 --> 13:22.350
I got us the special.
Crusty's souvenir cups with the dancing pizzas.

13:22.390 --> 13:25.350
They were just so cute
they reminded me of you.

13:25.390 --> 13:27.360
Aw.

13:34.130 --> 13:36.330
So, Julio, I'm really
glad you asked me out.

13:36.370 --> 13:38.400
And it was nice of you to invite Cece.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.200
So she didn't feel left out.

13:43.210 --> 13:46.280
And it was nice of you to invite Rocky,

13:46.310 --> 13:48.510
because she's never asked to go anywhere.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.380
So, here we are.
You and me.

13:55.420 --> 13:56.550
And Cece.

13:56.590 --> 13:59.420
I don't know how it could get any better.

13:59.460 --> 14:03.130
I am sorry to be late for pizza, Julio...

14:03.160 --> 14:05.430
What the heck are these
two yutzes doing here?

14:10.430 --> 14:15.170
I've got seven tickets to
Lady Gaga's sold-out concert.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.340
Yeah? Well, I've got
tickets to Lady Gaga, too,

14:18.370 --> 14:20.280
and I'm throwing in
a free T-shirt.

14:22.180 --> 14:23.450
I'll throw in a free T-shirt

14:23.480 --> 14:26.180
and my dad will drive you to the concert.

14:28.220 --> 14:31.190
Yeah, well, my tickets are free

14:31.220 --> 14:33.390
and I'll pay you five bucks to take them.

14:42.170 --> 14:45.300
You know, as a successful businesswoman,

14:45.340 --> 14:48.100
I pride myself on being able
to recognize a good deal

14:48.140 --> 14:49.170
when I hear one.

14:49.570 --> 14:52.070
Oh, thanks, Dina.

14:52.110 --> 14:54.510
You're welcome, sweetie.
But actually, I was holding out my hand

14:54.540 --> 14:56.410
for the five bucks you owe me.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.220
So, do you understand the plan, Tinka?

15:07.260 --> 15:08.490
If this one came up with it

15:08.530 --> 15:11.430
I think a garden mouse could follow along.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.300
Vegetarian for you, right Rocky?

15:15.330 --> 15:16.370
Yeah.
Thanks, Julio.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.430
That was so sweet of you to remember.

15:23.310 --> 15:25.040
I've got to tell you, Cece,

15:25.070 --> 15:27.080
it's really impressive to see
a girl eat a slice of pizza

15:27.110 --> 15:29.210
that's bigger than she is.

15:33.420 --> 15:37.320
In all fairness, everything
is bigger than she is.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.290
Wow, you're a little mean, huh?

15:42.190 --> 15:44.460
You have no idea.

15:51.170 --> 15:54.410
My secret signal is ridiculous.
I want a new one.

15:56.370 --> 15:58.080
What?

15:58.110 --> 16:00.080
Um...
Um...

16:00.110 --> 16:04.250
Unlike your adorable accent,
hers is hard to understand.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.380
And annoying.

16:06.420 --> 16:08.350
She doesn't like her drink
and she wants a new one.

16:08.390 --> 16:10.090
Would you mind?

16:10.120 --> 16:12.020
Thank you.

16:12.060 --> 16:15.360
Okay, you two can leave now.
He likes me.

16:15.390 --> 16:18.260
No, it's time for you two to leave.
He likes me.

16:18.300 --> 16:22.430
How about this for my new secret signal?
You two, get out!

16:27.110 --> 16:28.440
Hey!
Hello!

16:28.470 --> 16:30.140
Oh, my gosh.
You're so nice.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.180
So, for today's lesson plan,

16:36.220 --> 16:40.150
I thought we'd discuss the
famous novel written in 1844

16:40.190 --> 16:43.190
by a French man named Alexander Dumas.

16:43.220 --> 16:45.320
His book, <i>The Count of Monte Cristo,</i>

16:45.360 --> 16:47.560
is known as the granddaddy
of all revenge stories.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.440
Oh, I see. You glued
the chalk to the tray.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.240
Very clever.

17:07.349 --> 17:09.280
Oh, you got me again.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.319
Nothing I enjoy more
than a little tomfoolery.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.119
Moving on.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.260
Can anyone tell me
where France is on the map?

17:25.300 --> 17:27.270
All right, troops, back off.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.140
I think we should all give
Mr. Dillon a break now.

17:30.170 --> 17:33.310
No, not Mr. Dillon.
Call me

17:33.340 --> 17:36.040
the Count of Jackson Elementary!

17:41.280 --> 17:45.420
Ha! Take that! I invented the
first human magnet last night!

17:45.450 --> 17:48.420
So, who's the sucker now?
In your faces!

17:48.460 --> 17:51.160
Mmm-hmm.

17:51.190 --> 17:54.460
Well played, my genius friend.
Well played.

17:54.500 --> 17:58.170
Thank you.
And with that, I quit!

17:58.200 --> 18:00.370
Wait, Henry, aren't you
forgetting something?

18:00.400 --> 18:03.100
Oh, right, of course.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.120
I'll just come back for that later.

18:17.260 --> 18:20.320
Looks like we got the last laugh.

18:22.230 --> 18:23.290
Oh.

18:30.540 --> 18:34.170
Cece, I feel really bad
about yesterday. I'm sorry.

18:35.110 --> 18:37.310
I'm sorry, too.

18:37.340 --> 18:40.410
We should never let a boy get between us.

18:40.450 --> 18:42.110
Unless it's Taylor Lautner.

18:43.350 --> 18:46.350
Agreed. From now on,
sisters before misters.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.390
What are you two talking about?

18:48.420 --> 18:52.260
Which one of your sisters is a mister?

18:52.290 --> 18:55.530
No. Cece and I agreed to never
again fight over a boy.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.370
So, what I'm hearing is he's mine.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.430
Over your dead body.

19:01.470 --> 19:03.300
Um, Cece, actually, the expression is...

19:03.340 --> 19:05.370
No, I said it right.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.340
Looks like the fiery gopher has claws.

19:08.370 --> 19:10.180
You want a piece of this?

19:10.210 --> 19:11.440
Bring it on.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.250
You ready to cook?
'Cause it's about to get hot.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.350
Oh, yeah!

19:15.380 --> 19:17.380
Cece, stop!

19:17.420 --> 19:20.350
Come on, there's gotta be a
better way we can settle this.

19:21.390 --> 19:23.190
Rock, paper, scissors?

19:23.220 --> 19:25.330
Perfect, I have a large rock in my purse.

19:27.130 --> 19:30.330
Oh, you meant the version with the fingers?

19:30.370 --> 19:32.500
Yawn, but all right.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.070
Ready?

19:34.100 --> 19:35.470
Rock.
Paper. Scissors!

19:40.170 --> 19:42.080
I'm meeting someone.

19:42.110 --> 19:44.310
Over here, Julio!

19:44.340 --> 19:47.310
What are you two doing here?

19:47.350 --> 19:49.210
I knew you two couldn't be trusted,

19:49.250 --> 19:51.280
even after I won fair and square.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.380
Uh, I don't think so.

19:52.420 --> 19:54.290
I threw paper and paper covers rock.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.220
Yeah, but my scissors cuts your paper.

19:56.260 --> 20:01.230
And my good looks and
superior hair trump you both.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.460
Would someone please
tell me what's going on?

20:03.500 --> 20:07.330
Well, these two weren't sure which
one of us you "like" liked.

20:07.370 --> 20:10.070
We weren't sure, so we played
rock, paper, scissors.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.270
And I won.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.410
No, you didn't.
I won.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.380
What?
No, I won!

20:17.210 --> 20:19.150
Whoa, whoa! Hold on!

20:19.180 --> 20:21.450
You guys rock, paper,
scissored to see who won me?

20:21.480 --> 20:24.520
Yes, I thought we were
very clear about that.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.220
Not too bright, this one.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.560
Maybe Cece should get him.

20:30.590 --> 20:33.230
This is crazy.
I'm a person,

20:33.260 --> 20:35.160
not the last cookie on a plate.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.330
I don't "like" like any of you.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.400
I thought we were all friends.

20:38.430 --> 20:40.570
Besides, I'm not even allowed to date.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.470
I'm only twelve and a half.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.370
Oh, well, in that case...

20:44.410 --> 20:46.170
Ew!

20:47.180 --> 20:48.580
Sorry, Julio.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.620
Okay, mister, these
sisters are out of here.

20:56.150 --> 20:57.350
Just out of curiosity,

20:57.390 --> 20:59.220
if you were 14, which one of us...

20:59.260 --> 21:00.220
Cece!
Cece!

21:00.810 --> 21:01.800
Coming!

21:13.170 --> 21:15.070
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

21:21.150 --> 21:22.380
I couldn't resist either.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.480
Here, have mine.

21:30.090 --> 21:31.490
Hey, Dina. May I?

21:32.390 --> 21:35.130
Of course.

21:35.160 --> 21:38.260
Look, I'm sorry for the way
I've been acting lately.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.300
I was thinking about it

21:40.330 --> 21:43.140
and I'm proud that my girlfriend
is such an awesome businesswoman.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.470
Thanks, Deucey.

21:46.370 --> 21:50.110
Now, just wondering,

21:50.140 --> 21:53.150
would you ever be willing
to bake me a cake?

21:54.410 --> 21:56.120
I'll do you one better.

21:56.150 --> 21:58.120
Two cakes?

21:58.150 --> 22:00.350
No, baby, I've been thinking.

22:00.390 --> 22:04.060
What do you say we go
into business together?

22:05.390 --> 22:09.200
"D and D. You want it.
We can get it."

22:09.230 --> 22:11.500
Wait. There's no
phone number on this.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.230
That way no one can trace us.

22:14.450 --> 22:15.690
Wow, you're good.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.050
Just wondering...

22:19.550 --> 22:23.130
"D and D". The first D is for Duece, right?

22:24.250 --> 22:25.550
Yeah, ok.

22:25.550 --> 22:27.270
Whatever you say, cuties.

22:27.270 --> 22:28.530
Yes!
