17:14.533 --> 17:17.661
-Arlong has bled us dry.
-Then find more blood.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.048
Luffy?

17:30.257 --> 17:32.968
-What are you doing here?
-I could ask you the same thing.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.637
-This is where I belong.
-[Luffy] I don't believe that.

17:35.721 --> 17:39.767
-This is not you.
-No. This isn't the me you want me to be.

17:41.018 --> 17:41.852
Nami…

17:43.896 --> 17:45.355
if you need our help--

17:45.439 --> 17:48.442
No, I don't need any of you.

17:50.069 --> 17:54.323
Arlong wanted the map,
and I conned you into getting it for me.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.533
And you bought it.

17:57.826 --> 18:01.497
I was never part of your stupid crew.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.292
You don't mean that.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.421
Take the rest of these clowns
and sail away from here.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.299
I never want to see you again.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.183
[sighs]

18:23.936 --> 18:25.521
[chuckles]

18:25.604 --> 18:30.067
Okay, that went about as bad as it could.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.654
So back to the boat
before the fishmen find us?

18:33.737 --> 18:37.116
-Sail the hell out of here? Okay.
-There's something else going on here.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.159
She was very clear she wants us to leave.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.328
You don't know women.
They never say what they mean.

18:41.411 --> 18:45.124
-Tell me again why the cook gets a say.
-Don't you guys get it? She's one of them.

18:45.207 --> 18:49.586
She's a bad guy.
The villagers are terrified of her.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.755
Not all of them.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.343
Hey!

18:57.427 --> 18:58.345
Scar guy.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.892
Who was that lady?

19:04.935 --> 19:05.769
You know,

19:06.645 --> 19:08.021
the one with the cool hair?

19:08.105 --> 19:09.231
Who wants to know?

19:10.440 --> 19:11.775
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.278
-I'm a pirate--
-Hunter.

19:16.113 --> 19:16.947
Pirate hunter.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.451
-We're here to collect Arlong's bounty.
-[Genzo] You?

19:22.369 --> 19:24.621
I've seen men twice your size

19:24.705 --> 19:27.249
and with twice your number
go into Arlong Park.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.168
None of them ever came back.

19:29.751 --> 19:32.045
-We just want to talk to her.
-[Genzo] Trust me, you don't.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.256
But if it'll get you out of my town,

19:35.924 --> 19:39.720
try the house down that road,
on the edge of the tangerine grove.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.892
[adventurous music plays]

19:48.645 --> 19:53.066
[Usopp] I think I got more of a boat body
than a long-journey-on-foot kind of body.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.195
Anybody else missing the ocean?

19:56.278 --> 19:57.905
No? Okay.

19:58.530 --> 20:03.368
I could go bring the boat around
if we don't want to walk all the way back.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.302
-Whoa!
-Turn around and leave. Now.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.762
That's what I've been saying.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.305
Hey, I saw you earlier.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.849
I think maybe you and I have
something in common.

20:28.185 --> 20:31.146
I've got the gun,
and you're standing in front of it.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.358
-What could we possibly have in common?
-Let's start with Nami.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.779
-Seems you know her very well.
-She's a thief with no conscience.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.574
And when there's no more left to take,
she leaves and doesn't turn back.

20:42.658 --> 20:46.286
-Now get off my property.
-Nami's part of our crew.

20:47.788 --> 20:48.622
She's our friend.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.834
My sister doesn't have any friends.

20:53.543 --> 20:57.547
-The sooner you realize that, the better.
-Sisters. That makes sense.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.759
-Both as beautiful as each other.
-Give it up.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.553
I can tell
she really did a number on you guys.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.223
You're not special,

21:07.099 --> 21:08.267
and I can't help you.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.852
-How about a meal?
-What?

21:10.936 --> 21:14.773
An exchange of sorts
for your valuable time and information.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.942
-You cook?
-He's a waiter.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.277
Best cook in the East Blue.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.571
You never tasted anything better
in your life. Usopp's word!

21:23.323 --> 21:24.908
Ain't got much to cook with.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.661
You'd be surprised how much I can make
with very few ingredients.

21:28.328 --> 21:29.162
What do you say?

21:30.038 --> 21:33.166
We have a little dinner,
a little conversation.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.295
Fine.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.673
But there'd better be dessert.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.101
Mmm.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.397
Mmm.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.403
This is nothing.
You should see him at a curry house.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.159
A fair bit better
than Marine rations, huh?

22:09.369 --> 22:13.290
I didn't know you had the pleasure
of dining on a Marine vessel.

22:13.373 --> 22:14.416
Only in the brig.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.053
Where is he, Zeff? I know Luffy was here.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.764
This is a rare vintage from Micqueot.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.227
I've been saving it for something special.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.855
It's been a while since I've run into
anyone from the old days,

22:36.938 --> 22:39.900
even if we did find ourselves
on opposite sides of a cannon.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.444
Finally got yourself
on the right side of the law.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.657
The law had nothing to do with it.
It was time to stop.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.743
I took my choice.

22:50.827 --> 22:53.038
There's a new generation,
and they're coming up.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.082
It's their time now.

22:55.165 --> 22:57.125
[chuckles] Like hell it is.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.586
Bunch of impulsive children.

23:02.589 --> 23:06.093
Perfectly aged and ready to be enjoyed.

23:06.676 --> 23:07.886
You leave it too long,

23:09.388 --> 23:10.555
it'll go bad.

23:19.314 --> 23:21.233
Or you could just serve whiskey.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.986
[chuckles]

23:25.779 --> 23:27.781
[dance music plays]

23:30.617 --> 23:32.661
[overlapping chatter]

23:52.264 --> 23:54.266
[cheering]

23:57.477 --> 23:58.770
Yeah!

23:58.854 --> 23:59.938
Come on!

24:07.946 --> 24:09.489
[Arlong laughs]

24:11.408 --> 24:13.118
Arlong, we need to talk
about Coco Village.

24:13.201 --> 24:17.164
We can talk tomorrow.
Coco Village will still be there,

24:17.247 --> 24:20.333
provided they paid the tribute in full.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.879
That's what we need to talk about.
That and the terms of our deal.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.964
Always so serious, Nami.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.342
Have a drink. Relax.

24:29.426 --> 24:30.385
[explosion]

24:32.471 --> 24:33.472
[dance music stops]

24:34.723 --> 24:36.725
[military music plays]

24:41.646 --> 24:44.566
Captain Nezumi. What a pleasant surprise.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.610
Always good to catch up, Arlong.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.238
Although, I hear troubling news from Gosa.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.825
Seems they've recently
been raided by pirates.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.327
So terrible.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.496
There are other reports as well

24:58.079 --> 25:02.042
about fishmen stirring things up
around the Conomi Islands.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.305
I have additional concerns.

25:17.098 --> 25:17.933
How many?

25:18.600 --> 25:22.312
-About twice as many as that.
-That's double our usual arrangement.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.939
[Nezumi] Times are changing.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.691
It's getting harder than ever
to cover up your tracks.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.109
[chuckles]

25:28.693 --> 25:29.611
Nami.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.367
This is a party.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.995
Let's go upstairs to discuss our business.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.167
Nami, join us.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.547
[Sanji] Dinner's served.

25:52.676 --> 25:53.593
Mmm.

25:58.723 --> 25:59.849
Told you.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.986
You know, this is the best thing
I've eaten in my entire life.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.073
Listen. There's plenty more
where that came from, but…

26:17.158 --> 26:19.244
first, we really need to know about Nami.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.832
[suspenseful music plays]

26:24.457 --> 26:25.417
The truth is…

26:28.044 --> 26:30.547
-What's going on?
-[woman] Get in. Get in. Close the door.

26:30.630 --> 26:31.464
[Nami] Mom!

26:32.465 --> 26:33.341
Get in.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.302
-[Nami] Mom, please.
-Stay put.

26:35.385 --> 26:37.178
And no matter what you hear,
do not come out.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.096
[Nami] Mom!

26:47.230 --> 26:48.189
Who's there?

26:48.273 --> 26:50.567
-[gunshots]
-[villagers screaming]

26:50.650 --> 26:51.901
[footsteps approaching]

26:55.947 --> 26:57.490
-[gunshot]
-[gasps]

27:00.493 --> 27:02.621
Is that any way to treat a guest?

27:06.791 --> 27:11.296
Tribute is 100,000 Berry per adult.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.131
Go fetch it.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.310
Take it. It's all I got.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.062
[Arlong clicks tongue]

27:35.820 --> 27:36.655
Good.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.618
[laughs]

27:51.795 --> 27:53.797
Three plates on the table.

27:53.880 --> 27:54.964
How many people live here?

27:56.257 --> 27:57.092
Only one.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.220
No record of any family.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.805
[clicking tongue]

28:07.644 --> 28:09.688
How many people live here?

28:10.980 --> 28:11.856
How many?

28:19.739 --> 28:22.951
-I have two daughters.
-[Arlong] You'll have to pay for them.

28:23.034 --> 28:26.371
-Fifty thousand Berry each.
-I gave you everything I have.

28:26.454 --> 28:28.331
Too bad for you. It ain't enough.

28:29.624 --> 28:30.667
Don't you hurt her!

28:32.460 --> 28:35.547
-Mom.
-[Arlong] Oh, it's a family reunion.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.216
The little humans, so precious.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.760
Precious.

28:42.512 --> 28:43.722
[Nami crying]

28:50.186 --> 28:53.773
The money, will you take it as tribute
for my daughters?

28:53.857 --> 28:55.066
No, Mom, you can't!

28:55.900 --> 28:57.527
You understand what you're saying?

28:58.695 --> 29:00.071
-I do.
-[Nami] No, Mom!

29:00.155 --> 29:04.117
Why didn't you just lie?
You didn't have to tell him about us.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.660
Because you are my daughters,

29:06.661 --> 29:08.288
and I would never deny that.

29:09.956 --> 29:11.249
[crying]

29:11.332 --> 29:13.918
You deserve to live full and happy lives.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.755
I'm sorry I couldn't do more for you.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.884
Buy you nice things
or cook you nice meals.

29:23.511 --> 29:25.597
I'm sorry I wasn't a very good mother.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.974
[Nami] No. No, don't say that.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.776
Mom, no. [sobbing]

29:38.693 --> 29:40.737
Mom, no! No! No! No!

29:43.573 --> 29:45.533
[woman] Nami, Nojiko,

29:46.284 --> 29:47.494
I love you, girls.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.871
-[gunshot]
-[gasps]

29:55.335 --> 29:56.878
[Nami crying]

30:03.176 --> 30:04.427
[Sanji sniffles]

30:04.511 --> 30:05.386
[coughs]

30:06.805 --> 30:10.099
Wait. Nami's working for the pirate
that killed your mother?

31:17.917 --> 31:19.294
[Luffy] She was just a kid.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.387
She's not anymore.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.057
She made her choice.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.813
I'm tired of hearing about Nami
from other people.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.607
She told you to leave, Luffy.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.402
So did you.

31:48.531 --> 31:51.242
How do you know
she's not one of Arlong's crew?

31:51.951 --> 31:55.288
Same way I knew you weren't gonna kill me
when I cut you down from that cross.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.790
Same way I knew about Usopp

31:58.958 --> 31:59.876
and Sanji.

31:59.959 --> 32:02.086
Yeah, I don't know about that waiter.

32:03.212 --> 32:04.797
I know Nami's good.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.676
She needs to know it too.

32:17.727 --> 32:18.853
[dog barking]

32:22.690 --> 32:26.361
[Arlong] Tell me, Captain.
What's a fair price for your discretion?

32:27.820 --> 32:29.197
Ten thousand Berry?

32:30.114 --> 32:31.240
Twenty thousand?

32:32.825 --> 32:34.369
I thought we had a fair deal.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.039
[Nezumi] It's not easy
keeping Marine patrols out of the area.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.625
And with your increase in activity,

32:42.293 --> 32:45.797
it'd be a shame if word of this
got back to Marine headquarters.

32:46.756 --> 32:47.632
[Arlong] Hmm.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.973
I guess it's just the price
of doing business.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.977
You're a lot smarter than people
give you credit for.

33:02.689 --> 33:03.773
Because I'm a fishman?

33:05.400 --> 33:06.275
That's not what I--

33:06.359 --> 33:08.611
Does it surprise you
that I have intelligence?

33:09.696 --> 33:10.738
Ambition?

33:12.156 --> 33:15.743
Usage beyond manual labor for humans?

33:15.827 --> 33:20.415
Not at all. I've personally
never felt any ill will toward your kind.

33:20.498 --> 33:25.503
And yet the leaders of the organization
you so proudly represent

33:25.586 --> 33:27.714
saw fit to disparage

33:28.631 --> 33:30.633
and enslave my people.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.511
-Slavery has been abolished.
-But your prejudice remains.

33:33.594 --> 33:36.389
Fishmen have all the same rights
as humans.

33:36.472 --> 33:37.306
Do we?

33:41.811 --> 33:44.480
The World Government has worked very hard

33:44.564 --> 33:49.027
to foster better relations
between our people to keep the peace.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.071
A fishman
is one of the Warlords of the Sea.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.823
Jimbei is a fool!

33:53.906 --> 33:57.160
A government dog to an inferior master.

33:57.744 --> 34:00.538
I serve no man.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.209
Perhaps I was a bit hasty.

34:06.461 --> 34:09.088
I can accept the terms of our usual deal.

34:11.799 --> 34:12.675
[clicks tongue]

34:19.432 --> 34:20.266
Yes.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.228
You're smarter than people
give you credit for.

34:34.238 --> 34:36.616
-[Nami] And what about our deal, Arlong?
-What about it?

34:36.699 --> 34:37.700
I have the money.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.663
A hundred million Berry?

34:44.999 --> 34:48.795
Nami… have you been holding out on me?

34:48.878 --> 34:52.423
I stole that money fair and square.
Now are you ready to honor our agreement?

34:57.970 --> 35:00.014
Bring the money to me by sunrise,

35:01.390 --> 35:03.726
and I will consider the matter closed.

35:04.268 --> 35:05.103
[grunts]

35:14.946 --> 35:16.072
-Kuroobi.
-Mmm.

35:16.989 --> 35:18.324
Bring Nezumi back in here.

35:18.991 --> 35:20.576
-Go.
-[Kuroobi] Aye.

35:23.996 --> 35:28.459
Maybe there's a way for the rat
to earn some extra Berry after all.

35:30.169 --> 35:31.295
[chuckles]

35:35.508 --> 35:38.302
-Two Mistral Shooters, good man.
-[bartender] Coming right up.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.806
-What are you doing?
-Buying you a drink.

35:42.807 --> 35:45.351
-You're welcome.
-We can't. We're on duty.

35:45.434 --> 35:47.186
Oh, come on.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.153
Might as well enjoy this wild goose chase.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.241
Not much of a drinker, are you?

36:02.743 --> 36:07.039
I still don't know why Garp has such
a bug up his arse about this Straw Hat.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.381
-Two more.
-Aren't you full of surprises?

36:24.974 --> 36:26.893
Is this really
what we're supposed to be doing?

36:26.976 --> 36:28.227
What are you talking about?

36:28.936 --> 36:30.730
Maybe the Straw Hat Pirates
aren't the villains

36:30.813 --> 36:32.398
the Marines are making them out to be.

36:33.608 --> 36:36.569
Thought it'd take a lot more liquor
to bring out your mutinous side.

36:37.153 --> 36:40.072
It just seems like
if we keep making the same mistakes,

36:40.156 --> 36:41.782
nothing's ever gonna change.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.454
All right, out with it.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.082
You know something.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.422
Garp is Luffy's grandfather.

37:00.927 --> 37:04.889
Of all the things I thought you were going
to say, that wasn't even on the list.

37:04.972 --> 37:07.433
I should've known
from the way they both love meat.

37:09.435 --> 37:10.770
You can't tell anyone.

37:11.270 --> 37:12.188
It makes sense.

37:12.271 --> 37:18.486
Why else would a vice-admiral be going
after some rubber kid playing pirate?

37:19.320 --> 37:20.154
He's not playing.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.490
Say what you want about Luffy,
but he's the real deal.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.076
It doesn't matter. Not to a man like Garp.

37:25.910 --> 37:29.121
You color outside the lines,
you get your arm chopped off.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.251
-What?
-Seems like you can relate.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.837
Must've been hard growing up
with a dad like--

37:36.921 --> 37:39.924
I am nothing like that Straw Hat!

37:41.759 --> 37:44.095
Fellow with a straw hat
came through here the other day.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.222
Do you know where he was heading?

37:48.641 --> 37:49.558
I might.

37:50.434 --> 37:51.811
What's it worth to you?

37:52.311 --> 37:55.106
And then the creature turns towards me,

37:55.189 --> 37:57.400
flaring its tusks.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.986
The last of the wild boars of Jaya.

38:00.778 --> 38:01.988
[chuckles]

38:02.071 --> 38:03.155
Two days.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.616
Two days, I wrestled that crazed hog

38:06.284 --> 38:07.827
until finally I prevailed.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.789
And I cooked it over an open flame,

38:13.249 --> 38:15.042
and I ate it with my bare hands.

38:16.877 --> 38:18.170
Just fire and flesh.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.882
-And how did it taste?
-[Zeff] Oh.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.342
[sniffs]

38:23.426 --> 38:26.012
That meat, whoa.

38:26.095 --> 38:29.390
It was so tender,
it near melted off the bone.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.892
It was the best meal I've ever had.

38:34.020 --> 38:37.315
The longer they elude you,
the more satisfying the catch.

38:41.402 --> 38:42.236
You know,

38:43.654 --> 38:47.241
you're not tricking me
with your delicious stories.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.285
I'm not hunting a boar.

38:50.202 --> 38:55.374
The last thing I want to do is… put myself
in the middle of a family dispute.

38:59.211 --> 39:00.129
The kid's special.

39:01.756 --> 39:04.342
Reminds me of another pirate we knew
back in our glory days.

39:04.425 --> 39:05.301
Don't say it.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.053
It's not gonna make it less true.

39:08.846 --> 39:11.098
The kid reminds me of Gold Roger.

39:16.979 --> 39:18.189
And look what happened to him.

39:19.273 --> 39:20.149
Executed.

39:20.232 --> 39:22.318
Skewered by Marine polearms.

39:24.737 --> 39:25.696
I don't want my…

39:30.951 --> 39:32.870
I don't want the boy
to suffer the same fate.

39:32.953 --> 39:35.623
He stood up for Baratie
when we were attacked.

39:35.706 --> 39:38.209
I might be out of the game,
but I still live by the code.

39:38.292 --> 39:39.126
[Koby] Sir?

39:42.922 --> 39:44.507
[whispering indistinctly]

39:50.346 --> 39:51.639
Thank you for the meal.

39:57.311 --> 39:59.480
Have the navigator
set a course immediately

40:00.231 --> 40:01.440
for the Conomi Islands.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.025
-[Bogard] Aye, sir.
-Garp.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.740
You have to know
when it's time to let them go.

40:09.824 --> 40:12.326
Change is coming
whether you want it or not.

40:13.619 --> 40:14.829
It's their turn now.

40:16.664 --> 40:17.498
[Garp] Hmm.

40:18.749 --> 40:19.834
We'll see about that.

40:21.919 --> 40:23.921
[adventurous music plays]

40:30.970 --> 40:36.183
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,

40:36.267 --> 40:37.268
boom!

40:37.351 --> 40:38.853
[laughs]

40:41.689 --> 40:43.607
Yeah, I'm gonna go get some air.

40:45.568 --> 40:46.777
Can you just be quiet?

40:46.861 --> 40:50.489
Aw, come on. Where's the fun in that?

40:51.574 --> 40:55.411
Do you really think your little toys
can get through the skin of a fishman?

40:57.037 --> 40:59.748
-These are smoke bombs.
-[Buggy] Smoke?

41:00.332 --> 41:01.959
That's rich. [chuckles]

41:02.042 --> 41:06.505
Makes me think of how long it's been
since I've had any smoked fish.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.385
Maybe if you guys had some extra?

41:12.052 --> 41:12.970
Please?

41:15.514 --> 41:17.766
Ah, screw you guys!

41:17.850 --> 41:20.728
Arlong's gonna bite
the shit out of you anyway.

41:20.811 --> 41:23.272
You know you don't stand a chance
against him and his army.

41:23.355 --> 41:26.025
And you dumb pieces of garbage,

41:26.108 --> 41:28.986
you ain't gonna do anything
against that stupid--

41:29.069 --> 41:31.071
[grunts]

41:32.239 --> 41:34.241
New guy shuts up the clown head.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.828
[mumbles]

41:39.747 --> 41:41.457
[mysterious music plays]

42:11.862 --> 42:12.738
[grunts]

42:13.781 --> 42:14.782
[grunts]

42:17.493 --> 42:18.702
[Nojiko] How dare you?

42:20.120 --> 42:22.957
It's not enough that you're working
for our mother's killer,

42:23.040 --> 42:25.417
but now you're desecrating her grave too?

42:25.501 --> 42:27.920
-Nojiko. Nojiko, wait!
-[screams]

42:28.003 --> 42:29.672
[panting]

42:31.006 --> 42:32.675
It's not what you think.

42:32.758 --> 42:34.927
You have no idea what I think.

42:35.010 --> 42:36.136
Ah!

42:40.849 --> 42:41.809
What's this?

42:43.644 --> 42:46.272
Is this the money that you stole?

42:47.314 --> 42:49.775
And you're hiding it
next to our mother's body?

42:51.860 --> 42:55.447
-Nami, what kind of monster are you?
-You don't understand.

42:55.531 --> 42:56.991
Then make me understand.

43:11.171 --> 43:12.339
I need to speak with you.

43:13.674 --> 43:17.886
-And who are you?
-My name is Nami. You killed my mother.

43:17.970 --> 43:18.929
Nami.

43:20.556 --> 43:23.475
Oh, right, I did. The ex-Marine.

43:24.226 --> 43:26.520
She was brave. I'll give her that.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.356
Let me guess.
You've come to even the score.

43:33.152 --> 43:34.820
You want to kill me, little girl?

43:36.447 --> 43:37.281
No.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.533
I want to join your crew.

43:41.493 --> 43:43.037
[laughs]

43:47.541 --> 43:48.792
That is rich.

43:49.293 --> 43:52.796
But why would I ever let a human
onto my crew?

43:52.880 --> 43:54.882
Because I have something you want.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.557
[Arlong] You drew this?

44:05.601 --> 44:07.186
This is good.

44:08.604 --> 44:09.438
Very good.

44:10.522 --> 44:14.526
Maybe the best I've seen in the East Blue,
fishman or human.

44:14.610 --> 44:17.488
So let me join your crew,
and I'll help you.

44:17.571 --> 44:18.572
[Arlong] Help me?

44:25.829 --> 44:27.498
I killed your mother,

44:28.374 --> 44:32.670
and now you want to come work for me?

44:35.255 --> 44:36.090
Hmm.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.300
Why would you do that?

44:39.051 --> 44:41.178
Because you have something I want.

44:44.181 --> 44:46.600
[Nami] I told Arlong
I'd work for him on one condition.

44:47.309 --> 44:49.311
That he let me buy back Coco Village.

44:51.146 --> 44:52.231
And he said he would

44:53.732 --> 44:55.317
for a hundred million Berry.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.444
A hundred million?

44:59.613 --> 45:01.865
-That would take a lifetime.
-I have the money.

45:03.450 --> 45:04.535
All of it.

45:05.953 --> 45:09.123
And now I can buy the freedom
of the village and everyone in it.

45:17.339 --> 45:18.173
So…

45:21.009 --> 45:22.136
this whole time,

45:23.345 --> 45:24.763
you were trying to help.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.101
Why didn't you tell me?

45:33.313 --> 45:37.818
-Nami, I'm your sister. Why didn't you--
-I couldn't lose you too.

45:38.819 --> 45:39.820
Or anyone else.

45:46.660 --> 45:47.536
[sighs]

45:48.036 --> 45:50.414
So you kept that secret all these years.

45:52.916 --> 45:54.376
And you let me hate you.

46:00.048 --> 46:00.966
I hated you.

46:05.637 --> 46:07.431
[footsteps approaching]

46:10.601 --> 46:13.979
[Nezumi] A shame to break up
this touching scene.

46:15.147 --> 46:18.984
I've heard that pirates
are stashing their plunder in this area.

46:19.067 --> 46:21.487
You two wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

46:24.239 --> 46:25.949
That's obviously been stolen.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.661
By the authority of the Marines
and the World Government,

46:29.745 --> 46:31.330
I'm going to have to confiscate it.

46:31.413 --> 46:35.042
-No, you can't do that. It's mine!
-A hundred million Berry?

46:35.584 --> 46:37.711
And where would you get that much money?

46:39.087 --> 46:40.923
How did you know it was a hundred…

46:44.259 --> 46:45.886
Arlong put you up to this, didn't he?

46:49.097 --> 46:50.974
I… I don't know what you mean.

46:54.019 --> 46:55.270
-No!
-[Nezumi] Watch yourself.

46:55.354 --> 46:57.189
Or we will take you into custody as well.

46:57.272 --> 46:59.066
[Nami grunting]

47:02.694 --> 47:03.529
[Nami] No!

47:04.404 --> 47:05.864
You can't do this.

47:06.782 --> 47:08.450
You can't do this!

47:10.202 --> 47:11.036
[grunts]

47:13.455 --> 47:14.581
[Nami screams]

47:15.582 --> 47:16.959
No!

47:23.507 --> 47:24.341
[Nojiko] Nami, wait.

47:24.424 --> 47:26.134
Wait. Nami, stop! Wait. Wait!

47:26.218 --> 47:27.469
[grunting]

47:27.553 --> 47:30.222
-Nami.
-Let me go! Let me go! They can't do this!

47:30.305 --> 47:34.226
-There's nothing you can do!
-Arlong will kill the entire village!

47:34.309 --> 47:35.519
Nami, wait!

47:40.190 --> 47:41.275
[Arlong] My brothers!

47:52.286 --> 47:53.287
[sighs]

47:54.621 --> 47:57.332
We all know the truth of this world.

47:59.626 --> 48:03.046
Fishmen are
the rightful rulers of the seas.

48:03.630 --> 48:04.965
And the humans know it too.

48:06.174 --> 48:10.429
They fear our power,
so they bound us with chains.

48:10.512 --> 48:15.350
They loathe our presence,
so they banned us from their cities.

48:15.434 --> 48:16.435
[grunts]

48:16.518 --> 48:19.521
But we broke those chains, huh?

48:20.981 --> 48:22.691
Built our own cities.

48:22.774 --> 48:28.572
Now the time has come to restore
the natural order of this world.

48:28.655 --> 48:31.199
[all] Yeah!

48:31.783 --> 48:32.618
[Nami] No.

48:32.701 --> 48:34.286
[panting]

48:34.369 --> 48:35.203
Please!

48:35.287 --> 48:38.457
For centuries, humans have used us,

48:40.083 --> 48:41.668
kept us down.

48:43.003 --> 48:45.505
And our so-called leaders,
they allowed it.

48:46.965 --> 48:50.886
Banners of unity and peace
they so lovingly wave

48:50.969 --> 48:55.599
are, in truth,
flags of surrender, willing defeat.

48:56.850 --> 49:00.979
I don't know about you,
but I ain't surrendering.

49:01.063 --> 49:03.273
-Kill them all!
-[fishmen cheer]

49:03.357 --> 49:04.358
Yeah!

49:04.441 --> 49:06.652
[panting]

49:07.235 --> 49:10.489
We are the embodiment
of fishman superiority!

49:10.572 --> 49:14.409
And with the Grand Line map,
we will reclaim our birthright.

49:14.493 --> 49:17.913
Our righteous rage
will burn through Coco Village

49:17.996 --> 49:19.748
to the ends of the East Blue,

49:19.831 --> 49:22.960
and as we move
to the Grand Line and beyond,

49:23.043 --> 49:27.756
we will teach each and every human
their rightful place,

49:28.340 --> 49:29.174
beneath us.

49:29.257 --> 49:30.133
[fishmen] Yeah!

49:30.217 --> 49:31.218
Beneath us!

49:31.301 --> 49:32.803
[fishmen cheering]

49:32.886 --> 49:34.221
Yeah!

49:34.304 --> 49:37.307
Beneath us! Yeah!

49:38.016 --> 49:39.726
Yeah!

49:40.936 --> 49:45.232
