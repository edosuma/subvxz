WEBVTT

00:00.931 --> 00:02.798
I started looking into
the crack house fire.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.055
The building owner is Roger Maddox.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.801
If he's not setting the fires himself,

00:06.803 --> 00:08.570
that's a hell of a coincidence.

00:08.572 --> 00:11.606
This is slander with no
basis, pure and simple.

00:11.608 --> 00:13.708
- Is that?
- Jamie Killian.

00:15.312 --> 00:17.345
They were going to fire me.

00:17.347 --> 00:20.648
We're gonna need to reexamine
all the other old files.

00:20.650 --> 00:21.883
They're gone.

00:23.353 --> 00:25.086
- Gabi?
- Something's wrong.

00:28.024 --> 00:29.724
Come on. Come on!

00:31.528 --> 00:32.861
Gabi? Baby?

00:32.863 --> 00:35.597
First trimester pregnancy,
collapsed on scene.

00:35.599 --> 00:37.832
We're having trouble keeping her sats up.

00:37.834 --> 00:39.234
Call OB.

00:39.236 --> 00:41.002
Warm blood, level one transfuser.

00:41.004 --> 00:42.570
Call the OR.

00:42.572 --> 00:45.373
- She just...
- Yeah, she grabbed her stomach

00:45.375 --> 00:48.610
and then she folded
and then she passed out.

00:48.612 --> 00:50.478
- She just passed out?
- Yeah.

00:52.148 --> 00:55.016
Sats are coming up.

01:03.193 --> 01:06.327
- Belly's full of fluid.
- Matt? Matt?

01:06.329 --> 01:08.263
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

01:08.265 --> 01:11.466
I'm right here.

01:11.468 --> 01:14.769
Gabi, I'm not seeing an IUP.

01:17.774 --> 01:20.675
Damn. It's abdominal.

01:20.677 --> 01:22.677
- What does that mean?
- The fetus is implanted

01:22.679 --> 01:24.679
outside of her uterus,
somewhere in her abdomen.

01:24.681 --> 01:27.715
- Somewhere?
- I won't know where until I go in.

01:27.717 --> 01:29.350
The placenta leeches off the blood supply

01:29.352 --> 01:31.019
of whatever it attaches
to and when it tears,

01:31.021 --> 01:32.587
so does that site.

01:32.589 --> 01:35.557
We need to stop the bleeding.

01:35.559 --> 01:39.127
You can save the baby.

01:39.129 --> 01:40.562
OB's in route.

01:40.564 --> 01:43.464
She'll be in the OR with me.

01:43.466 --> 01:46.000
Hey.

01:46.002 --> 01:47.969
I'm not even worried.

01:47.971 --> 01:49.037
We'll do great.

01:49.039 --> 01:51.372
We didn't even get to find out

01:51.374 --> 01:52.941
if it's a boy or a girl.

01:52.943 --> 01:55.810
Baby, hey, hey. You're the
strongest person I know.

01:55.812 --> 01:58.179
You're gonna be fine, both of you.

01:58.181 --> 02:00.148
Okay?

02:00.150 --> 02:02.417
I love you.

02:02.419 --> 02:04.452
I love you too.

02:07.457 --> 02:08.823
It's time.

02:10.894 --> 02:12.827
Let's get her into the OR.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.346 --> 02:31.613
Will...

02:31.615 --> 02:33.348
do everything you can for the baby

02:33.350 --> 02:34.782
but if it comes down to a choice,

02:34.784 --> 02:36.684
- you save my girl.
- Matt, truth time.

02:36.686 --> 02:40.555
When I'm in there, she's the
only one I'm trying to save.

02:43.556 --> 02:48.356
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:52.777 --> 02:53.943
How is she?

02:53.945 --> 02:55.312
Dr. Halstead and the obstetrician

02:55.314 --> 02:56.946
are working to stop the bleeding.

02:56.948 --> 02:59.983
It'll be a few hours
before we get any news.

03:01.887 --> 03:04.587
You're acting truck lieutenant this shift.

03:04.589 --> 03:06.823
You got it, Chief.

03:06.825 --> 03:09.592
I gotta stop by OFI.

03:10.162 --> 03:12.096
Riddle'll come down on you in a second

03:12.098 --> 03:13.430
if we don't have those files.

03:13.432 --> 03:14.565
Let's not worry about me right now.

03:14.567 --> 03:16.433
Chief, Dawson went to the mat

03:16.435 --> 03:18.302
trying to nail Maddox for those arsons.

03:18.304 --> 03:20.204
There's no way I'm gonna let her wake up

03:20.206 --> 03:22.473
and have those files still missing.

03:22.475 --> 03:25.075
I'd like to come along.

03:25.077 --> 03:27.011
See if I can help.

03:31.284 --> 03:34.217
- All right.
- District says Antonio's undercover.

03:34.221 --> 03:35.853
They can't reach him right now.

03:35.855 --> 03:37.354
I'm gonna stay here with Casey.

03:37.356 --> 03:38.856
- Chief, you don't have to...
- Look.

03:38.858 --> 03:40.591
I'm just going to update
the house with news.

03:40.673 --> 03:42.673
Moment it comes in.

03:48.180 --> 03:51.648
Hey, listen,

03:51.650 --> 03:54.251
she's gonna make it, okay?

03:54.253 --> 03:56.120
They both will.

03:57.823 --> 03:59.690
Thanks.

04:05.464 --> 04:06.497
Holding at 110.

04:06.499 --> 04:09.800
98%.

04:09.802 --> 04:12.703
- Suction.
- Suction.

04:13.839 --> 04:15.139
Hold this. Suction.

04:15.141 --> 04:17.173
Suction.

04:17.176 --> 04:18.809
When you find the placenta,

04:18.810 --> 04:20.744
you're gonna wanna gently peel it away.

04:25.051 --> 04:27.751
The placenta's implanted on the cava.

04:31.257 --> 04:33.223
- Two sponge sticks.
- Sponge.

04:35.094 --> 04:37.561
Gimme your hand. Here, push down.

04:37.563 --> 04:38.662
Hard.

04:41.667 --> 04:45.169
Hold that. There.

04:45.171 --> 04:47.237
You move, she bleeds to death.

04:47.239 --> 04:49.773
- Got it?
- Got it.

04:52.178 --> 04:54.311
I don't get how files just walk outta here.

04:54.313 --> 04:55.779
You see a lot of security?

04:55.781 --> 04:58.382
Severide, what about
that girl you been seeing?

04:58.384 --> 05:00.617
The lawyer. She's already mixed up in this.

05:00.619 --> 05:03.053
I don't see Jamie breaking and entering.

05:03.055 --> 05:05.756
Well, enough to rule her out?

05:08.561 --> 05:09.793
I'll talk to Jamie.

05:09.795 --> 05:11.795
If she knows anything,
I'll get it out of her.

05:19.105 --> 05:22.973
Still in surgery.

05:31.750 --> 05:34.718
Okay, here's how it's gonna be.

05:34.720 --> 05:38.055
All right, first, we're
gonna have a great shift.

05:38.057 --> 05:39.456
All right?

05:39.458 --> 05:43.827
Focused, top of our
game, a 100% solid team.

05:43.829 --> 05:46.830
- Uh, Herrmann...
- Second,

05:46.832 --> 05:49.233
when Dawson comes through
this with flying colors,

05:49.235 --> 05:52.536
we're gonna throw a huge
party for her at Molly's.

05:52.538 --> 05:55.205
- Herrmann.
- One second, please.

05:55.207 --> 05:56.473
All right? Thank you, Otis.

05:56.475 --> 05:58.308
Herr-Mann.

05:58.310 --> 06:00.677
What?

06:00.679 --> 06:03.747
Molly's just got closed.

06:03.749 --> 06:05.782
Shut down.

06:08.020 --> 06:11.588
We got a code violation.

06:11.590 --> 06:12.890
I... I... I don't think...

06:12.892 --> 06:14.725
I don't think I just heard what you said.

06:14.727 --> 06:18.395
Those Portland jackals. They...

06:18.397 --> 06:20.264
they must have reported us.

06:20.266 --> 06:24.668
It says the building is
too close to the curb.

06:24.670 --> 06:28.405
The ordinance says we need
15 feet and we have 13.

06:28.407 --> 06:30.774
We're shut down.

06:37.586 --> 06:40.320
- Mr. Severide.
- Yeah.

06:40.322 --> 06:42.155
Good morning.

06:46.795 --> 06:49.297
Nice office.

06:49.999 --> 06:52.132
Nice assistant.

06:52.434 --> 06:55.802
Guess it all worked out for you, huh?

06:55.804 --> 06:59.439
This is my job, Kelly.

06:59.441 --> 07:02.976
Dawson's files on Maddox went missing.

07:05.648 --> 07:09.583
Somebody broke into OFI and stole them.

07:09.585 --> 07:10.984
Okay.

07:10.986 --> 07:13.553
If you want to accuse me of something,

07:13.555 --> 07:15.989
do it.

07:15.991 --> 07:18.725
Are you asking if I stole those files?

07:18.727 --> 07:20.260
Mm.

07:20.262 --> 07:24.031
Information fell into my lap.
I handed it off to a client.

07:24.033 --> 07:27.401
That is a hell of a lot
different than stealing.

07:29.471 --> 07:32.372
What about computer forensics?

07:32.374 --> 07:34.675
- What?
- We use them all the time.

07:34.677 --> 07:36.476
Even after a files been deleted,

07:36.478 --> 07:38.912
a guy who knows what he's
doing can usually find a trail.

07:38.914 --> 07:40.447
So you're helping me now?

07:40.449 --> 07:43.650
I just wanna show you that I
don't have anything to hide.

07:49.224 --> 07:52.559
Eventually, you will realize

07:52.561 --> 07:55.395
this was all just business.

07:55.397 --> 07:58.365
And when you do...

07:58.367 --> 08:00.734
you have my number.

08:00.736 --> 08:03.170
Sure.

08:16.051 --> 08:17.851
Gabi's in the ICU.

08:17.853 --> 08:20.253
We controlled the bleeding
and she's looking good.

08:22.424 --> 08:24.591
But we still need to keep an eye on her.

08:24.593 --> 08:27.828
And, um...

08:27.830 --> 08:29.396
the baby?

08:29.398 --> 08:31.498
For all intents and purposes,

08:31.500 --> 08:34.301
there never was a baby.

08:35.671 --> 08:39.539
I'm sorry, this just
wasn't a viable pregnancy.

08:43.879 --> 08:46.880
Now, when Gabi wakes up, do you...

08:46.882 --> 08:49.182
I can... I can talk to her.

08:51.286 --> 08:53.487
I'm around if you need me.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.689
Thank you.

08:55.691 --> 08:57.090
Chief.

08:59.962 --> 09:02.229
Matt...

09:02.231 --> 09:04.598
I'm so sorry.

09:22.050 --> 09:23.683
Hey, need some help?

09:23.685 --> 09:27.220
Do you ever just wanna hit something?

09:28.757 --> 09:31.958
Everything is just so messed up.

09:32.995 --> 09:36.163
Hey, Dawson's in good hands.

09:36.165 --> 09:38.932
Yeah, I know. I know, it's just...

09:38.934 --> 09:42.335
there's nothing we can
do about it except...

09:42.337 --> 09:45.705
wait and pray, I guess.

09:45.707 --> 09:47.874
I don't know, I just
feel like there should be

09:47.876 --> 09:51.344
something that we can do about Molly's.

09:51.346 --> 09:55.081
Dawson shouldn't have to come
out of this and deal with that.

09:56.718 --> 09:58.952
I could call my cousin Anthony.

09:58.954 --> 10:00.353
He's in construction.

10:00.355 --> 10:03.657
If there's a way around a
building code, he'll find it.

10:05.461 --> 10:06.760
All units call.

10:06.762 --> 10:08.762
Downed power lines. Person trapped.

10:08.764 --> 10:10.964
3300 West Carpenter.

10:26.315 --> 10:28.281
My son, Kevin, he's in there all alone.

10:28.283 --> 10:29.649
- You gotta get him out.
- Tell me what happened.

10:29.651 --> 10:31.151
The bouncy house... The wind blew it up.

10:31.153 --> 10:32.686
It hit the power lines and came back down.

10:32.688 --> 10:34.254
Okay, okay. We're on it.

10:34.256 --> 10:36.490
Alarm office, notify
ComEd we need a shutdown,

10:36.492 --> 10:37.724
and gimme an ETA.

10:37.726 --> 10:38.992
And then Gary went in to try to help,

10:38.994 --> 10:41.394
and all of a sudden, he just stopped.

10:41.396 --> 10:44.030
Hey, sir, are you all
right? What's going on?

10:44.032 --> 10:47.067
I can feel my feet tingling.

10:47.069 --> 10:48.902
All right, that ground's electrified.

10:48.904 --> 10:51.805
Everything in there's hot, the whole yard.

10:51.807 --> 10:54.508
Hey, get back. Back up away from the wire.

10:56.645 --> 10:57.944
- Hey, Kevin.
- Yeah?

10:57.946 --> 10:59.412
My name's Kelly.

10:59.414 --> 11:01.014
We're gonna get you out
of there in a few minutes.

11:01.016 --> 11:03.083
I just need you to sit
tight for a little bit, okay?

11:03.085 --> 11:05.352
- Yeah.
- You're being really brave.

11:05.354 --> 11:07.320
Power company ETA 15 minutes.

11:09.124 --> 11:10.557
Another flash like that,

11:10.559 --> 11:11.958
the whole house is gonna collapse.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.127
The power line's gonna
come down on that kid.

11:14.129 --> 11:16.830
You don't got 5 minutes, let alone 15.

11:24.235 --> 11:26.235
Cruz, Capp, get the father out.

11:26.237 --> 11:27.903
On it.

11:27.905 --> 11:30.772
Hey, we need to build a bridge.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.741
Everything I got on my truck is metal.

11:32.743 --> 11:34.643
We need to rig something up.

11:34.645 --> 11:37.045
Jimmy, Otis, listen,

11:37.047 --> 11:38.814
I need you guys to go house to house

11:38.816 --> 11:39.948
and find me a wooden ladder.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.416
Bust in some garages if you have to.

11:41.418 --> 11:43.485
- Okay, let's go.
- Mouch, get me a Stokes basket.

11:43.487 --> 11:45.687
- Hey, Tony, I need cribbing.
- Got it.

11:45.689 --> 11:47.122
Hey, sir,

11:47.124 --> 11:49.358
I'm gonna need you to start
moving back slowly, okay?

11:49.360 --> 11:50.759
Dragging your feet.

11:50.761 --> 11:52.461
Keep them on the ground.

11:52.463 --> 11:55.230
Just shuffle, slowly.

11:55.232 --> 11:57.165
Capp, Cruz, get ready for him.

11:57.167 --> 11:59.067
Nice and slow.

12:01.105 --> 12:03.472
I don't feel a tingle anymore.

12:07.344 --> 12:08.777
- Good? You good?
- Yeah.

12:08.779 --> 12:11.046
All right, good job.

12:11.048 --> 12:13.315
Hey, Kevin, we're gonna be
right in there for you, bud.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.651
Okay? You're being really
brave. You're doing great.

12:20.624 --> 12:22.457
Broke into a shed up the block.

12:22.459 --> 12:24.092
We owe 3226 a padlock.

12:24.094 --> 12:27.396
Posts lashed to the ladder,
ladder lined up at the house.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.431
Let's go. Let's go. Clove hitch knots.

12:29.433 --> 12:30.999
Let's go!

12:37.808 --> 12:40.609
Okay, let's go. We're running out of time.

12:40.611 --> 12:42.411
One, two, three, lift!

12:55.159 --> 12:57.859
All right, Stokes basket... bring it in.

12:59.330 --> 13:01.263
Just hold on, Kevin.

13:07.304 --> 13:08.704
Hurry... please!

13:12.142 --> 13:13.375
All right.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.043
All right, buddy, hang on.

13:18.782 --> 13:20.816
See? Told ya.

13:20.818 --> 13:22.684
Outta here in no time.

13:22.686 --> 13:25.320
Climb in. Climb in there.

13:25.322 --> 13:27.656
Oh, my God... Kevin!

13:36.600 --> 13:39.167
- Now!
- Got it... pull!

13:42.806 --> 13:44.172
All right.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.047
- Here, Cruz.
- I got him.

13:52.049 --> 13:54.082
Come on, bud.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.726
Thank you so much.

14:06.130 --> 14:08.964
Just glad he's okay.

14:08.966 --> 14:10.932
You did great.

14:29.586 --> 14:31.520
Hey, yeah. Chief.

14:33.157 --> 14:35.023
Uh-huh, yeah.

14:35.025 --> 14:37.325
Aw, that's great. Really great.

14:37.327 --> 14:39.694
Yeah.

14:39.696 --> 14:42.030
Aw, jeez. Yeah, okay.

14:42.032 --> 14:43.265
Okay.

14:43.267 --> 14:44.566
Thanks.

14:44.568 --> 14:46.635
Uh...

14:46.637 --> 14:48.437
Gabi's in the ICU.

14:48.439 --> 14:52.240
She's doing great.

14:52.242 --> 14:54.776
The baby didn't make it.

15:05.422 --> 15:08.123
The important thing is Gabi's doing okay.

15:08.125 --> 15:09.891
Yeah.

15:17.668 --> 15:21.403
Boden's there, so...

15:21.405 --> 15:24.339
it means 51 is there.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.308
They know that we're thinking about them,

15:26.310 --> 15:29.778
and when the time comes,

15:29.780 --> 15:31.646
we will be there for them. Okay?

15:39.823 --> 15:42.023
Hey, I just got a call that
PD's computer guy's available.

15:42.025 --> 15:45.126
- Hit it. I got you covered.
- All right.

15:48.131 --> 15:50.165
Well, your girl was right.
The files have been wiped

15:50.167 --> 15:52.868
- from the whole system.
- Can you tell who did it?

15:52.870 --> 15:54.002
Well, all I got is a time stamp,

15:54.004 --> 15:55.203
so it could have been anybody in the system

15:55.205 --> 15:56.304
at the time of the wipe.

15:56.306 --> 15:58.473
What I can tell you is
that whoever did this,

15:58.475 --> 16:00.909
they knew what they were looking for.

16:00.911 --> 16:02.878
Surgical strike.

16:02.880 --> 16:06.314
- So, what? A hacker?
- No, the opposite.

16:06.316 --> 16:08.917
What I'm saying, and I
am not accusing anybody,

16:08.919 --> 16:11.119
but this person... they're
familiar with your system.

16:11.121 --> 16:13.822
You're looking at an inside job.

16:13.824 --> 16:15.891
You have any idea who
knew about these files?

16:15.893 --> 16:19.060
Well, Dawson, of course, and Susie,

16:19.062 --> 16:21.096
but she called in sick.

16:24.701 --> 16:26.401
What is Susie's last name?

16:26.403 --> 16:28.203
- Wilder.
- Hmm.

16:28.205 --> 16:30.572
- Wait, what're you doing?
- Oh, I'm calling the district.

16:30.574 --> 16:33.275
Susie's gonna have to
account for her whereabouts.

16:33.277 --> 16:35.477
Okay, but sending the cops after her...

16:35.479 --> 16:36.811
Yeah, hold on. You're talking about

16:36.813 --> 16:39.281
theft of city records and
a criminal investigation.

16:39.283 --> 16:41.216
What, you wanna look the other way on that?

16:41.218 --> 16:42.751
Oh, no, of course not.
It's just hard to believe...

16:42.753 --> 16:44.553
- Okay. Uh-huh? Yeah.
- Susie would...

16:44.555 --> 16:46.521
Thanks.

16:46.523 --> 16:50.158
Kelly, I'm really sorry you
got pulled into all this.

16:50.160 --> 16:53.528
You hear from this Susie
chick, you give me a call.

16:55.465 --> 16:56.731
Thanks.

17:09.546 --> 17:11.579
Hey, Sylvie.

17:11.582 --> 17:13.714
- Hey, Chief.
- Hey.

17:13.717 --> 17:15.317
How's she doing?

17:15.319 --> 17:18.053
Just woke up a few minutes ago.

17:19.756 --> 17:23.290
The doctor said the
baby never had a chance.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.895
There was nothing anyone could have done.

17:26.896 --> 17:30.432
It just wasn't meant to be.

17:34.171 --> 17:38.273
I'm just so grateful you're okay.

17:38.275 --> 17:42.043
Is that Boden and Brett in the hallway?

17:42.045 --> 17:44.112
Yeah, but you don't have to...

17:44.114 --> 17:46.815
They can come in.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.519
Okay.

17:59.630 --> 18:01.863
How is she?

18:01.865 --> 18:06.067
I, uh... think she's still in shock.

18:06.069 --> 18:08.703
Well, she's been through a lot.

18:08.705 --> 18:11.606
She needs time to process everything.

18:11.608 --> 18:13.041
You both do.

18:13.043 --> 18:15.744
I know.

18:15.746 --> 18:18.780
Anyway, she's asking for you both.

18:18.782 --> 18:20.048
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:20.050 --> 18:22.083
Go on.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.522
Hey.

18:27.524 --> 18:30.525
Hey. Thanks for coming.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.861
We're just glad you're all right.

18:32.863 --> 18:36.865
- How you feeling?
- Okay, I guess.

18:42.072 --> 18:45.573
- Is the doctor coming soon?
- Are you in pain?

18:45.575 --> 18:48.410
- Do you want me to get a nurse?
- No, I just want an update

18:48.412 --> 18:50.912
on how the baby's doing.

18:54.184 --> 18:56.785
Um, Casey, why don't you pop out

18:56.787 --> 19:00.321
and ask the nurse when
the doctor's gonna be by.

19:05.862 --> 19:10.131
I need Dr. Halstead to Gabriela
Dawson's room right away.

19:10.133 --> 19:12.267
Code blue to ICU.

19:12.269 --> 19:14.202
Casey!

19:14.204 --> 19:15.603
Her pressure just bottomed out.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.413
Something broke loose. She's rebleeding.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.449
Call the OR. Start pounding those fluids,

19:27.451 --> 19:30.385
and call for blood.

19:30.387 --> 19:32.420
- Bag her. Let's intubate.
- Right away.

19:36.159 --> 19:38.193
She's crashing.

19:43.611 --> 19:45.846
A piece of the placenta
was hidden behind the bowel.

19:45.848 --> 19:48.015
When it broke loose, Gabi
started bleeding again.

19:48.117 --> 19:50.517
What? They just...

19:50.519 --> 19:51.885
miss stuff?

19:51.887 --> 19:54.187
Rebleeding is really
common in cases like this.

19:54.189 --> 19:56.523
A lot of the time, the
docs have to go back in.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.362
Well, what kind of odds
are we talking about here?

19:59.364 --> 20:01.898
I think she's gonna do great.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.600
Really.

20:05.437 --> 20:08.138
We just have to keep a good thought.

20:14.179 --> 20:16.246
Duff!

20:16.248 --> 20:17.814
Hey.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.784
Hey, look who it is.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.652
I heard Dawson was back in surgery,

20:22.654 --> 20:24.387
so I thought... I'm
just gonna drop this off,

20:24.389 --> 20:25.856
and I gotta go back.

20:25.858 --> 20:29.092
You know, I heard from PD.

20:29.094 --> 20:30.827
- Susie checked out.
- Really?

20:30.829 --> 20:32.362
Yeah.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.431
That's great.

20:34.433 --> 20:35.866
Yeah, they cleared her.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.634
What? You sure?

20:37.636 --> 20:39.469
She was sitting with friends
when the files got wiped.

20:39.471 --> 20:41.037
Bunch of people saw her.

20:41.119 --> 20:43.720
She...

20:43.722 --> 20:46.489
Well, that's great.

20:46.491 --> 20:48.058
I guess.

20:48.060 --> 20:52.062
I mean, I know you wanted to
get to the bottom of this, and...

20:54.199 --> 20:57.901
I just hated the thought that
a nice girl like Susie would...

21:00.439 --> 21:03.373
Hey, you think this plant's okay?

21:03.375 --> 21:06.476
I was gonna get one of those
arrangements with the...

21:06.478 --> 21:10.580
stuffed bear, but I thought
a stuffed animal might be...

21:15.921 --> 21:18.088
What's going on Duff?

21:18.090 --> 21:21.725
I'm just worried about Dawson is all.

21:25.263 --> 21:29.733
And this thing with the... files.

21:29.735 --> 21:32.569
Hey you don't think...
I mean, those doctors,

21:32.571 --> 21:34.137
they didn't... did they say anything about

21:34.139 --> 21:37.107
stress playing a part at all?

21:37.109 --> 21:40.610
Because she was really
worried about this case,

21:40.612 --> 21:44.314
and, uh, I mean, I... the
last thing I would want is...

21:44.316 --> 21:48.284
Duffy, there's a reason
why I sent Dawson your way.

21:48.286 --> 21:51.321
It's because I knew that
you would take care of her.

21:54.593 --> 21:56.860
It's no secret that Benny
was a better firefighter

21:56.862 --> 21:58.662
than a father, I get that,

21:58.664 --> 22:02.532
and you... you took that place.

22:04.970 --> 22:07.504
I can't repay that.

22:11.376 --> 22:13.209
If there's ever anything
you wanna talk about,

22:13.211 --> 22:16.746
anything at all, I'm here.

22:22.087 --> 22:25.288
I didn't get rid of those files, Kelly.

22:33.999 --> 22:36.733
I'll talk to you later.

22:36.735 --> 22:39.102
Give Gabi my best.

22:48.046 --> 22:51.114
Who's hungry?

22:51.116 --> 22:52.949
Come on, guys.

22:52.951 --> 22:54.617
You gotta eat.

22:54.619 --> 22:57.153
Just have a little something?

22:57.155 --> 22:58.555
Grab a nibble, guys.

22:58.557 --> 23:00.757
- Thank you, Cindy.
- Of course.

23:03.228 --> 23:05.061
- You're amazing, you know that.
- Mm.

23:05.063 --> 23:08.364
I think it's more the power
of a church phone tree.

23:08.366 --> 23:10.633
No.

23:10.635 --> 23:13.603
It's you.

23:13.605 --> 23:15.638
- Lieutenant.
- Yeah?

23:15.640 --> 23:17.774
I got something I need to look into.

23:17.776 --> 23:21.377
I know that this is a bad time, but, um...

23:21.379 --> 23:23.346
could these guys give me a ride?

23:23.348 --> 23:27.984
If there's a call, we'll
totally get him there.

23:27.986 --> 23:30.220
Yeah, sure... just keep
your ear to that radio.

23:30.222 --> 23:31.488
Go on.

23:31.490 --> 23:32.889
Thank you for the sandwiches.

23:32.891 --> 23:34.424
Bye.

23:43.135 --> 23:45.034
Hey, Anthony. Thanks for coming.

23:45.036 --> 23:47.837
No problem. How's your pop doing?

23:47.839 --> 23:51.040
Eh, you know Dad. This is Chili and Brett.

23:51.042 --> 23:53.943
Hey, how you do...

23:53.945 --> 23:57.013
Ladies. Hello. Very pleased to meet you.

23:57.015 --> 23:58.548
Any friend of Jimmy's is a friend of mine.

23:58.550 --> 24:02.051
Anthony, what's the story?

24:02.053 --> 24:03.586
I don't know what to tell you.

24:03.588 --> 24:06.122
Code says you have to
be 15 feet from the curb.

24:06.124 --> 24:08.725
That's 13. 13 ain't 15.

24:08.727 --> 24:11.427
Oh, hey, you happy now?

24:11.429 --> 24:15.265
Oh, I'm sorry if you're
upset about your little pub,

24:15.267 --> 24:17.267
but the laws are the laws.

24:17.269 --> 24:19.435
We just care about the neighborhood.

24:19.437 --> 24:21.104
Yeah? Just keep walking.

24:21.106 --> 24:22.705
Oh, my God!

24:22.707 --> 24:24.674
- Chili.
- What?

24:26.077 --> 24:28.044
- Anthony.
- Sorry, buddy,

24:28.046 --> 24:30.246
I wish I had a different...

24:32.484 --> 24:34.918
How old is this structure?

24:34.920 --> 24:36.853
Oh, I remember Herrmann saying something

24:36.855 --> 24:40.490
about it being around since Prohibition.

24:40.492 --> 24:43.860
Jimmy, grab me one of the
baggies I got in my toolbox.

24:46.832 --> 24:49.732
You ever hear of Joliet-Lemont limestone?

24:49.734 --> 24:51.968
Ambulance 61,

24:51.970 --> 24:53.803
man down from unknown causes.

24:53.805 --> 24:55.805
2129 W. Harrison.

24:55.807 --> 24:57.073
Is that...

24:57.075 --> 24:58.741
County morgue.

24:58.823 --> 25:00.757
- Come on.
- Yo, we gotta go.

25:00.759 --> 25:04.527
Stick around. I'll give you a ride.

25:10.502 --> 25:11.968
This has never happened before.

25:11.970 --> 25:15.371
I mean, I heard stories, like,
in Poland or Brazil or China...

25:15.373 --> 25:17.106
- Sir.
- Lionel Flowers.

25:17.108 --> 25:19.108
I'm just an assistant. I'm not the M.E.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.367
I'm really not trained to
deal with this sort of thing.

25:21.369 --> 25:23.136
Okay, Lionel, just take a deep breath.

25:23.138 --> 25:24.804
I'm supposed to take 'em
from the gurney to the tables

25:24.806 --> 25:26.672
so Dr. Wu could do the autopsy,

25:26.674 --> 25:29.042
and the son of a bitch moved.

25:38.596 --> 25:40.196
Sir?

25:40.198 --> 25:42.465
Sir, do you know your name?

25:42.467 --> 25:44.667
- Did he say anything to you?
- If he talked to me,

25:44.669 --> 25:48.070
I'd be passed out next to him,
not standing here with you.

25:48.072 --> 25:50.172
Ugh, he's out.

25:50.174 --> 25:51.207
Lionel, I need you to tell me

25:51.209 --> 25:52.575
everything you can about this man.

25:52.577 --> 25:54.510
Um... uh...

25:54.512 --> 25:57.112
Noah Arkin, pronounced DOA in the field.

25:57.114 --> 25:59.181
Untreatable Fine V-Fib.

26:01.185 --> 26:02.952
Bradycardia.

26:02.954 --> 26:07.056
Heart rate's 30 beats a minute.
Does he have a heart condition?

26:07.058 --> 26:08.924
Um... uh...

26:08.926 --> 26:11.260
History of Wolf-Parkinsons-White Syndrome.

26:11.262 --> 26:12.962
I wonder if that's why
they called it in the field.

26:12.964 --> 26:14.997
Bradycardia's super rare in WPW.

26:14.999 --> 26:17.500
These patients usually have
a rapid ventricular response.

26:17.502 --> 26:19.001
Nobody would suspect a low heart rate.

26:19.003 --> 26:22.204
Pushing atropine.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.076
Heart rate's up to 65.

26:27.078 --> 26:29.712
Oh, he's dropping.

26:29.714 --> 26:32.581
Pace him.

26:32.583 --> 26:34.283
- 70?
- 70 joules.

26:34.285 --> 26:35.718
Pace him at 80 beats per minute.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.153
Okay.

26:38.155 --> 26:40.155
Ready?

26:40.157 --> 26:42.525
Yeah.

26:47.999 --> 26:49.999
Heart rate's up to 80.

26:53.204 --> 26:55.170
Captured.

26:55.172 --> 26:57.206
You're just gonna still keep shocking him?

26:57.208 --> 27:00.209
Can I get a hand?

27:00.211 --> 27:03.712
He's not dead.

27:03.714 --> 27:05.714
The defibrillator's acting as a pacemaker.

27:05.716 --> 27:07.950
It looks weird, but it's
actually keeping him stable.

27:07.952 --> 27:11.921
Ready? One, two, three.

27:18.095 --> 27:21.030
Dawson's outta surgery.

27:21.032 --> 27:23.265
And the date?

27:23.267 --> 27:25.334
November 3rd.

27:25.336 --> 27:28.070
Good. Follow me.

27:28.072 --> 27:31.173
Could you tell me those words
I asked you to remember earlier?

27:31.175 --> 27:35.044
House, pencil, ball.

27:35.046 --> 27:37.246
Perfect.

27:41.852 --> 27:43.752
She's neurologically intact.

27:43.754 --> 27:45.721
An OB will be by later to check on her too,

27:45.723 --> 27:47.022
but she's looking great.

27:47.024 --> 27:49.525
Okay.

27:49.527 --> 27:53.529
And, um... does she remember?

27:53.531 --> 27:57.499
I thought you'd wanna be the
one to talk to her about that.

27:57.501 --> 28:00.869
I'm a text away if you need anything.

28:09.180 --> 28:12.014
Gabi.

28:20.858 --> 28:22.725
Hey.

28:23.761 --> 28:25.461
It's all right.

28:46.484 --> 28:48.417
"The unique materials qualify the structure

28:48.419 --> 28:50.419
as historically significant."

28:50.421 --> 28:53.889
Molly's officially can't be
torn down or altered in any way.

28:53.891 --> 28:56.025
Wait, wait, wait. How
is that even possible?

28:56.027 --> 28:57.459
Joliet-Lemont limestone,

28:57.461 --> 28:59.328
and cousin Anthony.

28:59.330 --> 29:02.097
Does that assemblage of
words mean anything to you?

29:02.099 --> 29:04.933
It's the bricks on the
front of Molly's, Mouch.

29:04.935 --> 29:07.436
Apparently, it's rare.
Serious old Chicago stuff.

29:07.438 --> 29:09.505
Used to be everywhere, but
most of the old buildings

29:09.507 --> 29:11.440
with it got destroyed, so Anthony...

29:11.442 --> 29:13.776
Who's in construction. Legitimately.

29:13.778 --> 29:15.444
Helped me get the application

29:15.446 --> 29:17.546
for historical status to the committee.

29:17.548 --> 29:19.615
They approved it right away.

29:19.617 --> 29:21.884
Molly's can reopen tonight.

29:21.886 --> 29:23.385
Wow, kid,

29:23.387 --> 29:25.988
you're amazing.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.358
I knew you could do it.

29:38.035 --> 29:40.436
How's our girl?

29:40.438 --> 29:43.505
Will says she's completely
out of the woods.

29:43.507 --> 29:46.475
For good this time.

29:46.477 --> 29:48.844
Well, when can we go in and see her?

29:48.846 --> 29:51.880
The doctors say she's gotta rest right now,

29:51.882 --> 29:55.417
but, uh... I told her
how you've all been here,

29:55.419 --> 29:59.321
and she can't wait to see you
when she's a little better.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.861
Uh, okay, well, come on, guys.

30:05.863 --> 30:07.463
Now's not the time.

30:07.465 --> 30:08.797
Let's let them have their space,

30:08.799 --> 30:11.300
besides we got a couple
hours left on shift.

30:11.302 --> 30:13.368
Back to the house, everybody.

30:13.370 --> 30:15.504
- Out.
- Thanks, Herrmann.

30:15.506 --> 30:17.506
Everyone.

30:17.508 --> 30:19.541
See you all at the house.

30:55.112 --> 30:57.279
Hey, courier dropped them off.

30:57.281 --> 30:59.148
They're addressed to you.

31:38.088 --> 31:39.655
Duff.

31:39.657 --> 31:42.324
Hey, it's Kelly. I got the files.

31:42.326 --> 31:44.059
Give me a call back as
soon as you get this.

31:44.061 --> 31:45.761
Please.

31:47.631 --> 31:49.264
You, uh...

31:49.266 --> 31:52.301
you thinking maybe you
wanna do a welfare check?

31:54.104 --> 31:55.838
Yeah.

31:55.840 --> 31:59.007
Let's go.

32:02.246 --> 32:04.479
Hey, Tony, he lives just a
few block up here, all right?

32:06.650 --> 32:08.684
Hey, we got a problem.

32:23.701 --> 32:26.201
- Duff!
- Suit up.

32:26.203 --> 32:27.603
What're you doing, man?

32:27.605 --> 32:30.339
I needed money, Kelly.

32:30.341 --> 32:32.774
It's okay.

32:32.776 --> 32:35.210
It's all right. Just get down from there.

32:35.212 --> 32:36.478
Talk to me over here.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.714
There's no going back from this.

32:38.716 --> 32:41.416
I made mistakes I can't fix.

32:44.889 --> 32:48.724
Those boxes have everything
you need to close the case.

32:48.726 --> 32:51.793
I put back every piece of analysis.

32:51.795 --> 32:54.329
Every evidence log.

32:54.331 --> 32:57.532
Everything Maddox paid me to whitewash.

32:59.136 --> 33:01.169
That's great.

33:04.875 --> 33:08.377
Now you gotta do the tough part, man.

33:08.379 --> 33:11.013
You gotta stick around for the fallout.

33:11.015 --> 33:14.016
Please, Duff.

33:14.018 --> 33:16.885
I know what kinda man you are.

33:20.691 --> 33:23.592
Show me that I'm right.

33:23.594 --> 33:26.795
I'm sorry, Kelly...

33:28.299 --> 33:29.998
But you're wrong.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.633
No!

33:40.410 --> 33:42.243
- Coming through!
- Move, move, move.

34:20.349 --> 34:21.882
Got him!

34:55.518 --> 34:57.218
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.762
It's up to you now.

35:27.116 --> 35:29.383
Excuse me?

35:29.385 --> 35:31.385
Sorry if we're interrupting.

35:31.387 --> 35:33.120
They said it was okay if we come back here.

35:33.122 --> 35:35.122
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

35:36.592 --> 35:39.693
Kevin made you something.

35:39.695 --> 35:41.729
You did?

35:45.067 --> 35:46.433
Wow.

35:58.381 --> 36:00.314
I could make a better one.

36:00.316 --> 36:02.550
You kidding me?

36:02.552 --> 36:04.919
I, uh...

36:06.622 --> 36:09.089
I had a really bad day today,

36:09.091 --> 36:12.593
and you just made it
a heck of a lot better.

36:12.595 --> 36:15.930
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

36:15.932 --> 36:17.831
I like how tall you made me.

36:19.936 --> 36:21.869
Hey, check it out.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.680
Thank you, Kevin.

36:36.886 --> 36:39.219
Thank you.

37:00.276 --> 37:03.644
I've seen a lot of chiefs talk a good game

37:03.646 --> 37:07.147
about how they turned
their house into a family.

37:07.149 --> 37:09.016
Truth is, a lot of the times

37:09.018 --> 37:14.288
I don't really get the way
you run this place, but...

37:14.290 --> 37:16.490
I have never seen a house
come together in a crisis

37:16.492 --> 37:19.393
like yours did today.

37:19.395 --> 37:22.429
I'm honored to be a part of it.

37:26.035 --> 37:28.068
Thank you, Captain.

37:33.643 --> 37:36.076
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:36.078 --> 37:41.615
today we almost lost two
really important things to us...

37:41.617 --> 37:45.586
Our home away from home, and a person...

37:45.588 --> 37:47.688
who's the heart of this home.

37:47.690 --> 37:50.758
And as much as I love this joint,

37:50.760 --> 37:52.259
if it came down to choosing

37:52.261 --> 37:55.963
between this and my friend,

37:55.965 --> 38:02.002
I'd give up a million
Molly's for one Gabi Dawson.

38:02.084 --> 38:04.485
And luckily, God in all his wisdom

38:04.487 --> 38:07.855
decided to bless us twice.

38:07.857 --> 38:10.824
So let's say a few cheers
for our beloved Molly's,

38:10.826 --> 38:12.659
and way more important,

38:12.661 --> 38:15.796
our friend, Gabi.

38:15.798 --> 38:18.298
Hear! Hear!

38:18.300 --> 38:19.500
- Yes!
- Yeah.

38:25.608 --> 38:28.709
- Your speech was great.
- Ah.

38:28.711 --> 38:30.878
I wish Dawson could have heard it.

38:30.880 --> 38:34.648
Yeah, she don't need to hear
me rattling on about the bar.

38:34.650 --> 38:38.018
She don't care about that right now.

38:39.121 --> 38:42.189
What is it?

38:42.191 --> 38:44.858
I just feel really bad for them.

38:44.860 --> 38:46.326
I know there's no magic thing

38:46.328 --> 38:48.428
to say to make 'em feel better, but...

38:48.430 --> 38:50.130
Oh, Herrmann.

38:50.132 --> 38:51.732
I mean, you're better at

38:51.734 --> 38:55.702
getting to the heart of
things than anyone I know.

38:55.704 --> 38:57.905
I'm sure you have

38:57.907 --> 39:00.941
the perfect thing to say already.

39:07.616 --> 39:09.917
Hey. No, no, no. She's good.

39:09.919 --> 39:13.887
Antonio's case finished
up, so he's with her now.

39:13.889 --> 39:15.689
Yeah, sure.

39:15.691 --> 39:16.757
No problem.

39:16.759 --> 39:18.392
Okay.

39:18.394 --> 39:21.428
You got something from Herrmann.

39:25.601 --> 39:27.568
Hey, Gabi.

39:27.570 --> 39:30.037
I been trying to think of
the right thing to tell you

39:30.039 --> 39:31.972
to make you feel better,

39:31.974 --> 39:35.342
but I know it don't work that way,

39:35.344 --> 39:37.644
so, here's the thing.

39:37.646 --> 39:40.447
When Cindy and I got married,

39:40.449 --> 39:42.816
she got pregnant right away,

39:42.818 --> 39:45.452
but, uh...

39:45.454 --> 39:48.222
we lost the baby.

39:48.224 --> 39:49.890
And I just thought,

39:49.892 --> 39:53.126
"What'd we do to deserve this?"

39:53.128 --> 39:57.464
I was so angry...

39:57.466 --> 40:01.034
but me and Cindy,

40:01.036 --> 40:05.505
we just held on to each
other as tight as we could,

40:05.507 --> 40:07.241
and so, here we are,

40:07.243 --> 40:10.310
five kids later, and...

40:10.312 --> 40:12.546
I got a family I never imagined,

40:12.548 --> 40:14.848
including uh...

40:14.850 --> 40:18.585
one more girl that I didn't expect,

40:18.587 --> 40:22.022
and she came to me full grown.

40:22.024 --> 40:23.590
She's strong and brave

40:23.592 --> 40:26.627
and courageous and really special,

40:26.629 --> 40:30.430
and I love her like my own,

40:30.432 --> 40:34.134
and someday she's gonna make a great mom.

40:35.404 --> 40:39.072
So, I guess all I'm trying to say is

40:39.074 --> 40:40.974
hang on, Gabi.

40:40.976 --> 40:43.010
Your day is coming.

40:59.094 --> 41:00.961
Take a look at it...

41:00.963 --> 41:02.596
I think in the Great Barrier Reef...

41:07.770 --> 41:09.770
So...

41:09.772 --> 41:13.507
can we... can we talk...

41:13.509 --> 41:16.977
about what all this means?

41:16.979 --> 41:20.814
I mean, we got back together
because I was pregnant.

41:20.816 --> 41:24.017
We got back together
because we love each other.

41:24.019 --> 41:26.920
Hey, Matt, it's me. Okay?

41:26.922 --> 41:30.123
I know how hard this must be for you.

41:30.125 --> 41:33.660
You've wanted kids your whole life.

41:40.002 --> 41:42.703
I want you.
