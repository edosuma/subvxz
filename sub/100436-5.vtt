WEBVTT

00:12.055 --> 00:13.361
- Oh, hey, Jake.

00:13.404 --> 00:14.666
What's--what's the deal
with the office today?

00:14.710 --> 00:16.233
It--it feels crazy.

00:16.277 --> 00:17.495
- Somebody stole
20 bricks of coke

00:17.539 --> 00:18.801
and some machine guns
from evidence.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.716
- What? It's the first
I'm hearing of it.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.152
- Yeah, well,
you just got here, right?

00:22.196 --> 00:24.546
- Right. I need you to find
whoever did this

00:24.589 --> 00:27.201
and kill them...

00:27.244 --> 00:29.333
till they're dead.

00:29.377 --> 00:32.119
Bonkers morning, huh?
So, any idea who did it?

00:32.162 --> 00:33.511
- No, but whoever it was

00:33.555 --> 00:35.600
had an intimate knowledge
of our security systems.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.428
It was obviously
an inside job.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.735
- I bet it was Brian.
- Why do you say that?

00:39.778 --> 00:43.608
- Because...he once said
he has a hot tub.

00:43.652 --> 00:44.696
You know how that crowd is.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.611
- I didn't know
Brian had a hot tub.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.091
That does sound bad.
- Yeah.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.745
- But we have to let the
investigation run its course.

00:49.788 --> 00:52.139
Right now,
everyone's a suspect.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.531
- Except for
Hitchcock and Scully.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.185
Whoever did it took the stairs.
- What'll happen

00:55.229 --> 00:57.361
to the person, you know,
if you find them?

00:57.405 --> 00:58.841
- Well, they've committed
several felonies.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.495
Probably looking at, uh,
30-to-life.

01:00.538 --> 01:04.499
- So that person
could miss 15 Olympics.

01:04.542 --> 01:07.067
Cool.

01:07.110 --> 01:08.068
I have to go.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.201
They know
the drugs are missing.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.856
They don't suspect me because
I'm playing it super cool.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.553
Now, when is the handoff?

01:15.597 --> 01:18.382
Yes, I'm alone
in the ladies' room.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.167
No one can hear me.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.646
- Okay, so I know something,

01:21.690 --> 01:24.301
but you can't ask
how I know it.

01:24.345 --> 01:25.650
- Debbie...
- It's Debbie.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.130
- Took the coke and the guns.
- Debbie, right?

01:27.174 --> 01:28.740
- Yeah. We know it's Debbie.
- Acting super suspicious.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.154
- Debbie, can I see you
in my office?

01:51.198 --> 01:52.677
- Yeah, sure.
What's this about?

01:52.721 --> 01:54.592
- We'll talk in my office.
- It'll just take a minute.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.464
- Oh. Heh. Wow.

01:56.507 --> 01:58.509
This morning's
full of surprises, huh?

01:58.553 --> 02:01.208
First, that stolen cocaine
that Hot Tub Brian took,

02:01.251 --> 02:03.471
now this unrelated thing
following me.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.689
Ha--you know what?

02:04.733 --> 02:06.169
I think I'm gonna
go make a sandwich

02:06.213 --> 02:07.431
I just--I love sandwiches.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.519
I'll meet you in there.

02:08.563 --> 02:09.825
Guilty of loving sandwiches,
right?

02:09.868 --> 02:11.174
- Debbie.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.654
- Mmm, what do I want
in my sandwich?

02:12.697 --> 02:15.439
Let's see.
Definitely ham, cheese,

02:15.483 --> 02:16.875
baking soda for sure,

02:16.919 --> 02:19.835
French vanilla creamer,
ooh, orange chicken.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.576
Ah!
- Debbie!

02:21.619 --> 02:23.186
- Ooh!

02:23.230 --> 02:24.448
- You really thought
you'd get away with it?

02:24.492 --> 02:26.363
- Damn, Scully!
- I was planning on eating

02:26.407 --> 02:27.451
that orange chicken later!

02:27.495 --> 02:28.670
- Is that why
you took her down?

02:28.713 --> 02:30.889
Do you even know about
the missing cocaine?

02:30.933 --> 02:32.413
- Cocaine?
- So we don't know

02:32.456 --> 02:33.675
where Debbie has hidden
the drugs.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.546
We searched her car,
her apartment--

02:35.590 --> 02:37.635
we even tried
the location data on her phone,

02:37.679 --> 02:39.202
but she was smart,
she had it turned off.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.290
- Or her battery died.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.465
According to
her Screen Time app,

02:41.509 --> 02:43.337
she plays five hours a day
of a game

02:43.380 --> 02:45.295
called "Cool Girl in School."

02:45.339 --> 02:46.557
- I love "CGIS."

02:46.601 --> 02:48.168
I just made captain
of the color guard.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.169
Junior year's looking up.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.300
- The coke Debbie took

02:50.344 --> 02:51.736
was evidence
against Silvio Nucci.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.129
Now, he wanted it gone,

02:53.173 --> 02:54.913
and I think he got Debbie
to do his dirty work.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.741
- I'm sorry,
you think Debbie is working

02:56.785 --> 02:59.222
with notorious crime boss
Silvio Nucci?

02:59.266 --> 03:00.745
The same Debbie who has
a denim jacket

03:00.789 --> 03:02.399
that says "Rock 'n Roll"?
- It was her.

03:02.443 --> 03:03.531
I heard her setting up a drop.

03:03.574 --> 03:04.836
- And why were you
in the women's room?

03:04.880 --> 03:06.490
- It wasn't for a gross reason.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.449
The men's room was occupied,
and I had to dump out.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.494
- Well, as long as
it wasn't for a gross reason.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.453
- We know you did it, Debbie.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.759
Just tell me the truth.
Let me be your friend here.

03:14.803 --> 03:17.458
- Thank you, but I already have
plenty of friends.

03:17.501 --> 03:21.331
Gil, Finn, Goldie, Bubbles--

03:21.375 --> 03:24.334
- Those are clearly just
the names of your pet fish.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.901
- Okay, fine.

03:25.944 --> 03:28.382
They're my fish.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.687
And I took the drugs.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.863
I'm sorry.
I screwed everything up.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.952
- Okay, this is good.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.519
Now just tell me
why you did it.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.608
- Because I need my drugs.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.697
I'm a big time drug girl.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.699
- Debbie, I don't think
that's true.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.354
I think Silvio Nucci
forced you to do this

03:44.398 --> 03:45.964
against your will.
- Nucci?

03:48.967 --> 03:51.840
What?

03:51.883 --> 03:54.016
- She sat there and laughed
for 40 minutes.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.322
- She's never gonna
turn on Nucci.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.714
I'll bet she's heard stories

03:56.758 --> 03:58.238
of what he does to people
who testify against him.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.500
- Man, I wish there
was something we could do

03:59.543 --> 04:00.631
to help her.
- Why?

04:00.675 --> 04:01.937
- Well, I know
she committed a crime,

04:01.980 --> 04:03.547
but she's clearly
in over her head.

04:03.591 --> 04:05.027
I don't think she's actually
a bad person.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.724
- She's a grown-up
who made her own decisions,

04:06.768 --> 04:08.291
and now she has to suffer
the consequences.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.684
- You might not get it,
but personally,

04:09.727 --> 04:11.033
I relate to someone
who made a mistake

04:11.076 --> 04:12.426
and can't find their way
out of it.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.732
When I was younger,
I was thoroughly hoodwinked

04:14.776 --> 04:17.474
by the so-called good people
at Columbia CD Club.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.259
Next thing you know,
I had 16 copies

04:19.302 --> 04:20.564
of Blind Melon's first album.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.349
- In high school,
I broke into a bunch of houses

04:22.392 --> 04:24.046
and wound up in juvie.
- What? That's terrible.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.917
- I mean, yeah,
Rosa's is a little worse.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.571
- I was in ballet school,
and there was so much pressure

04:27.615 --> 04:29.312
to be perfect all the time
that I just snapped.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.705
If I hadn't been underage,
I would've gone to prison.

04:30.748 --> 04:31.880
It's all the more reason
you should

04:31.923 --> 04:33.273
have sympathy for Debbie
and understand

04:33.316 --> 04:34.926
why she could use our help.
- Nobody helped me.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.188
My parents kicked me
out of the house

04:36.232 --> 04:37.538
and told me I was on my own.
- I'm so sorry

04:37.581 --> 04:38.887
you had to go through
all that alone, Rosa.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.628
- No, it was a good thing.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.021
I had to face my mistakes
and fix them by myself.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.762
It made me a stronger person.
So, no, I don't think

04:44.806 --> 04:46.547
we should take pity on Debbie.
- Okay, fine.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.418
But even so,
wouldn't you rather take down

04:48.462 --> 04:50.333
Silvio Nucci,
a known crime boss,

04:50.377 --> 04:51.421
instead of Debbie Fogle,

04:51.465 --> 04:53.075
a rewards member
at JOANN Fabrics?

04:53.118 --> 04:55.338
- Yeah, but Debbie's not gonna
testify against Nucci.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.601
- You may be right.
And that's why...

04:57.645 --> 04:59.603
we're gonna catch him
in the act.

04:59.647 --> 05:00.952
Brace yourselves, everyone.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.998
We're about to pop that Nucci.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.782
Apologies, that was
inappropriate in the workplace.

05:04.826 --> 05:07.524
But in my defense, that was
a song that I learned about

05:07.568 --> 05:10.571
from Columbia House, Rosa.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.050
Mm.
All right, here's the plan.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.358
- Why are we going this way?
The bathroom's back there.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.404
- I'm breaking you out.
I work for Silvio Nucci.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.623
- Oh, my God.
You work for Nucci? Me too!

05:19.667 --> 05:21.843
- Way too loud, Debbie.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.584
Okay. Press yourself
against the wall

05:23.627 --> 05:26.064
to avoid being seen
by the camera.

05:26.108 --> 05:27.631
- Why didn't she do it
with her back to the wall?

05:27.675 --> 05:29.807
Face first seems like
such a mistake.

05:31.461 --> 05:32.984
- Oh, no, they found us!
- No, no, no, Debbie.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.377
Rosa's on Nucci's payroll, too.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.465
She's getting us out of here.
- Oh.

05:35.509 --> 05:36.814
- Debbie. Trunk. Now.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.033
- Sorry, it's a little tight
in there.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.034
- Oh, I'm not picky.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.470
I don't need light or oxygen.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.385
I'm kind of like
a low-maintenance plant.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.126
Ooh, like a succulent.
- That's great, Debbie.

05:44.169 --> 05:45.519
- My mom always said that--
- But the trunk is closing

05:45.562 --> 05:49.000
on its own, it's definitely
not me slamming it.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.612
- So you guys
are gonna stay here with me?

05:51.655 --> 05:52.482
- Nucci thought we could
help you guard the coke.

05:52.526 --> 05:53.788
- Oh, I can handle it.

05:53.831 --> 05:54.919
I'm pretty tough.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.486
I take self-defense
at the women's gym.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.270
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

05:58.314 --> 06:00.316
- Oh, neat. You actually
say the words "hi-ya,"

06:00.360 --> 06:01.491
like Miss Piggy.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.579
- So when's Nucci coming
to pick up the coke?

06:02.623 --> 06:05.147
- Uh, could be hours,
could be days.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.409
- Days?
- I don't know.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.150
Nucci just said
to wait by this burner phone.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.586
He said he always works
like that.

06:09.630 --> 06:10.718
- Right, of course.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.589
We have so many inside jokes
about it.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.026
- I can imagine.
He is pretty funny.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.333
He's always like,
"Debbie, if you mess this up,

06:17.377 --> 06:18.943
I'm gonna gut you like a fish."

06:18.987 --> 06:19.988
What?

06:20.031 --> 06:21.119
- So he threatened you.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.556
That's why you went dirty.
- No.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.906
He offered me
a million dollars.

06:24.949 --> 06:25.994
I had no choice.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.474
My dad is really sick,
and he needed

06:27.517 --> 06:29.519
this expensive
experimental surgery.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.303
- Ahh.
- What about you guys?

06:31.347 --> 06:33.262
How did he turn you?
- Well, I've been dirty

06:33.305 --> 06:35.438
long before Nucci
came onto the scene.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.874
I do a ton of coke.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.223
They call me Mr. Springtime

06:38.267 --> 06:40.487
because of how fast
I make the snow disappear.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.446
- Wow.
I've never even had a nickname.

06:43.490 --> 06:46.449
I mean, I guess people
do call me, "Hey, lady."

06:46.493 --> 06:48.146
- Right, well, I'm gonna
let the Nine-Nine know

06:48.190 --> 06:49.452
we're looking for you,
you know,

06:49.496 --> 06:50.888
so those idiots don't think
we broke you out.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.368
- Ooh, you think
they're idiots?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.369
- Oh, yeah, big time.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.849
I mean, Holt's a blowhard,

06:54.892 --> 06:56.503
Jeffords is all brawn,
no brains

06:56.546 --> 06:58.548
Boyle's a laughing stock,
Amy's just the worst.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.376
I mean, she thinks
she so smart and so pretty

07:00.420 --> 07:01.725
and she makes me feel good
about the world

07:01.769 --> 07:03.423
and my place in it, and she--

07:03.466 --> 07:04.902
- Smells like .
We've all smelled her.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.122
Rosa, let's go outside.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.863
Hey, you know that was
Undercover Jake

07:08.906 --> 07:10.212
talking in there, right?
- Relax, man.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.605
- So you're not gonna tell Amy
what I said.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.520
- Oh, no, I definitely am.
I'm saying relax because

07:13.563 --> 07:15.043
there's no way you can stop me.
- Damn it.

07:15.086 --> 07:16.348
Well, did you at least
text the Nine-Nine

07:16.392 --> 07:17.480
and tell 'em we don't know
when the handoff is?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.003
- Yeah, but man,
I don't like this.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.614
We found the drugs. We should
just forget about Nucci

07:20.657 --> 07:22.050
and take Debbie in.
- What?

07:22.093 --> 07:23.486
Nucci is
the real bad guy, here.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.140
And you heard Debbie,
she's only doing this

07:25.183 --> 07:26.446
to get the money
for her dad's surgery.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.273
- There are other ways
to get money.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.232
She could've gone to a bank.
- Right. And she's white.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.625
She definitely would've
gotten approved.

07:31.668 --> 07:32.974
Terrific point.
- That's not what I was saying.

07:33.017 --> 07:33.975
- Ah, we were both
thinking it.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.367
Anyways, it doesn't matter.

07:35.411 --> 07:36.934
Our plan is working.
What are you worried about?

07:36.978 --> 07:38.980
- There's a loose cannon
in there with two machine guns.

07:39.023 --> 07:40.460
- She's not a loose cannon.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.940
I saw her apologize to a chair
after bumping into it.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.987
Trust me, we are not gonna have
any problems with Debbie.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.337
- Hey, Jake, guess what?
You made cocaine sound so cool,

07:48.380 --> 07:49.381
I decided to try it.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.600
But I didn't wanna overdo it,

07:50.644 --> 07:52.559
so I only did, like,
a tiny, little toot.

07:52.602 --> 07:53.560
Then I didn't feel anything,

07:53.603 --> 07:54.561
so I did, like,
a little bit more,

07:54.604 --> 07:55.823
and I still didn't
feel anything,

07:55.866 --> 07:56.911
so then I did a lot more,
and then I felt it.

07:56.954 --> 07:58.216
Like, I really felt it.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.044
So then I did a couple more,
like, big ass toots.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.524
Why do you guys
keep ducking behind the bed?

08:01.568 --> 08:03.047
- 'Cause you keep
pointing those guns at us.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.180
- Oh, my God.
Do not worry about it.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.138
It's only fine.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.532
- We need to find out
how Nucci got to Debbie.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.664
Fortunately, it turns out

08:10.707 --> 08:12.579
she kept
a fairly comprehensive diary.

08:12.622 --> 08:15.190
- As a power journaler,
I think we can hold off

08:15.233 --> 08:16.539
on using the word
"comprehensive."

08:16.583 --> 08:18.323
Oh, damn, that's comprehensive.

08:18.367 --> 08:21.413
- These are all
just from this year?

08:21.457 --> 08:23.415
- This one is labeled
August 21st.

08:23.459 --> 08:26.288
- "Morning." This one
is August 21st "Evening."

08:26.331 --> 08:29.030
- This entire diary is about
an episode of "House Hunters."

08:29.073 --> 08:30.205
- This is gonna take forever.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.598
- I actually took
a speed reading course.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.687
I tested at 800 WPM.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.167
- That's pathetic.
I tested at 802.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.342
- That's pretty close
to Holt's score.

08:37.386 --> 08:38.735
- No, no, 802's incredible.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.302
She pwned me.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.391
I read the entire
Urban Dictionary

08:42.434 --> 08:44.611
So I could converse with
the other uniformed officers.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.656
Finished I in 47 minutes.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.311
- I've never been so attracted
to a gay man before,

08:49.354 --> 08:50.704
and I dated several in college.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.749
- Shall we have a read-off,
Santiago?

08:52.793 --> 08:55.012
- We don't have finger guards.
- So we do it raw.

08:55.056 --> 08:57.232
- Okay,
I normally don't encourage

08:57.275 --> 08:58.712
such childish competitions,

08:58.755 --> 09:00.496
but this might help
things go faster.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.976
My only question is Holt,

09:02.019 --> 09:04.108
are you sure your old ass eyes
are up to the challenge?

09:04.152 --> 09:05.414
- I know you're just trying
to motivate me,

09:05.457 --> 09:06.633
but these old ass eyes

09:06.676 --> 09:09.592
will be reading your tombstone,
son.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.465
- Oh, I needed more light
in this place.

09:13.509 --> 09:14.641
Now I can finally think,

09:14.684 --> 09:16.164
and the ideas are, like,
flowing out of me.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.427
Okay, what about this one?
It's hamburgers,

09:18.470 --> 09:20.081
but the pickles are coins.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.517
- Still feel bad for her
now that she's a cokehead?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.345
- She's not a cokehead.
She's an innocent girl

09:23.388 --> 09:25.608
in a stressful situation
who did cocaine one time

09:25.652 --> 09:26.740
and will probably
never do it again.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.655
- Whoo!
Guess who just did more coke?

09:28.698 --> 09:29.743
This is my thing now.

09:29.786 --> 09:32.180
Ooh! Okay.

09:32.223 --> 09:33.616
- Is it Nucci?
- Yes.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.575
He wants to know if I can
do the handoff in two hours.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.185
Um, I'm gonna tell him no

09:37.228 --> 09:39.709
because I'm having so much fun
with my new best friends,

09:39.753 --> 09:41.189
Jake and Rosa.
- Ah, no, no, no.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.669
Don't mention us.
You know, because

09:42.712 --> 09:44.671
you're supposed to be working,
not enjoying yourself.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.108
Right, just keep it short.
Say two hours is great.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.066
- That's very smart,
and I'm gonna send him

09:49.110 --> 09:51.591
my favorite GIF
of Mr. Bean giving a thumbs up.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.071
Oh, Mr. Bean.
What a stud.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.682
Hey Rosa, what would you do

09:55.725 --> 09:57.727
if you could do anything
to Mr. Bean?

09:57.771 --> 09:59.729
- Nothing.
- Come on, Rosa.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.426
Don't be shy.
Say what you would do

10:01.470 --> 10:03.820
to international sex symbol
Mr. Bean's body.

10:03.864 --> 10:06.475
- Fine. I would take
a very large glass--

10:10.697 --> 10:12.437
let himself out.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.438
- I see.
- Wow.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.223
Um, I just have
one quick note.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.704
Mr. Bean never--

10:17.747 --> 10:19.575
beg for mercy.
- Ah, great note, Debbie.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.664
The point is we all think
Mr. Bean is sexy as hell

10:21.708 --> 10:22.839
and wish we looked
exactly like him.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.580
- You're closer than you think.
- Hm?

10:24.624 --> 10:25.668
- Oh, hey, Rosa,
it's not that

10:25.712 --> 10:26.713
you're a third wheel
or anything,

10:26.756 --> 10:27.931
it's just that
we're out of ice,

10:27.975 --> 10:29.846
so could you go get us
some more ice, please?

10:29.890 --> 10:33.589
- Hey, well,
this is full of ice, but yeah.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.112
I'll hit up the Nine-Nine.
- You've actually been

10:35.156 --> 10:37.114
texting the Nine-Nine a lot,
haven't you?

10:37.158 --> 10:38.507
- Yeah, to make sure
our cover's intact,

10:38.550 --> 10:39.682
and so they don't figure out
that we're dirty.

10:39.726 --> 10:40.727
- Is that what's
really going on?

10:40.770 --> 10:42.076
'Cause I feel like
there's something

10:42.119 --> 10:43.251
you're not telling me.
- I feel like

10:43.294 --> 10:44.731
all that coke
is making you paranoid.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.167
- No, you're paranoid.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.734
Now, don't you dare
take another step.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.736
-  Okay, Debbie,
what are you doing?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.563
- Give me your phone.
- That's it.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.478
Debbie Fogle,
you are under arrest.

10:53.522 --> 10:54.479
- What? Oh, my God.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.567
Are you not really dirty?
- Ah--

10:55.611 --> 10:57.439
- No. And I'll be
taking that gun.

10:57.482 --> 11:00.485
- Hi-ya!

11:00.529 --> 11:02.444
- Okay so the women's gym
and the cocaine

11:02.487 --> 11:04.489
have given Debbie super powers.

11:04.533 --> 11:08.798
Cool. Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.670
- You're making a big mistake,
Debbie.

11:10.713 --> 11:11.845
This isn't gonna work.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.368
- I'm such a terrible
judge of character.

11:13.411 --> 11:14.891
I was wrong about Rosa,

11:14.935 --> 11:17.067
I missed all the signs
with my cousin Jared.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.635
- The sandwich guy.
- What is wrong with me?

11:19.679 --> 11:20.897
- Nothing,
you're just coming down

11:20.941 --> 11:22.594
from the many handfuls of coke
you did.

11:22.638 --> 11:24.248
- Right. I'm so dumb.
I'm such an idiot.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.772
I'm dumb!
I'm dumb!

11:25.815 --> 11:27.904
- Ah, hey, why don't you let me
hold your gun for you,

11:27.948 --> 11:29.776
and then you can hit yourself
in the face with your fist

11:29.819 --> 11:31.255
like a normal person
having a mental breakdown.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.127
- I can't give you my gun.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.389
You'll probably try
and arrest me.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.043
- Debbie, I'm not like Rosa.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.174
Here, check my phone.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.393
I haven't been texting
the Nine-Nine.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.308
I have nothing to hide.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.266
- I don't know, there are
a lot of sweet messages

11:42.310 --> 11:43.964
between you and Amy.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.356
I thought you said
she stinks like .

11:45.400 --> 11:46.880
- She does.
- Prove it.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.011
Describe her stink to me.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.273
Don't think about it,
just say it.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.058
- Bad mayo, three-day-old
macaroni salad.

11:51.101 --> 11:54.278
- Okay. I buy it.
I trust you.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.976
- Why'd you do that?
- Rosa probably

11:56.019 --> 11:57.281
told the Nine-Nine
that you're corrupt

11:57.325 --> 11:58.935
and they could use your phone
to track us

11:58.979 --> 12:00.328
to the new drop site.
- Oh.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.982
Right. Smart.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.461
Hey, should I drive?
You know, that way,

12:03.505 --> 12:05.072
you can take a nap and get
the coke out of your system.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.290
- And we'll both be calm and--

12:06.334 --> 12:08.075
and you just did a bunch more.
- I did!

12:08.118 --> 12:11.165
I'm the King of New York!
I'm driving! Whoo!

12:13.907 --> 12:16.866
- So how's it going?
- What do you want, Terry?

12:16.910 --> 12:18.825
Or are you just here
to fan some more flames?

12:18.868 --> 12:21.218
- No, I'm just here
to see who's losing

12:21.262 --> 12:23.699
and therefore has to
wear this hat I made

12:23.743 --> 12:25.919
that says, "More Stupider."

12:25.962 --> 12:27.877
Fine, yeah,
I'm fanning flames.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.792
Fan, fan, fan, fan, fan,
Santiago.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.795
- Don't call her Santiago,
call her Virginia Slim.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.798
Because I'm smoking her.
- Damn, Ray!

12:35.842 --> 12:37.800
- You guys are moving fast,
but there's no way

12:37.844 --> 12:39.889
you're actually
comprehending anything.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.065
I'm taking my time
and reading deliberately,

12:42.109 --> 12:44.807
and you know what they say,
slow and steady wins the race.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.157
- Psh, classic reg-reader
bullcrap.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.332
- Yeah, what are you
gonna say next,

12:48.376 --> 12:49.986
that you read to relax?

12:57.080 --> 12:58.342
- This is so much better

12:58.386 --> 12:59.822
than that dump
of a hotel, right?

12:59.866 --> 13:01.171
This place
has six chimneys.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.825
- Uh, hey, Debbie,
whose house is this?

13:02.869 --> 13:04.174
- Oh, it's mine.
I own it, um,

13:04.218 --> 13:05.785
until 11:00 a.m. on Monday.

13:05.828 --> 13:06.829
We have to be out by then,

13:06.873 --> 13:09.179
or it's another $45,000
to Airbnb.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.834
But until then,
I'm a mansion girl.

13:11.878 --> 13:12.835
- What happened
to using the money

13:12.879 --> 13:14.141
for your father's surgery?

13:14.184 --> 13:15.838
Was that a lie?
- No. My dad really is sick,

13:15.882 --> 13:18.014
but I found out this morning
that my stupid brother Derek

13:18.058 --> 13:19.363
already paid for his surgery.

13:19.407 --> 13:20.756
He thinks he so great
'cause he's, like,

13:20.800 --> 13:22.932
a big shot lawyer,
and he has a family,

13:22.976 --> 13:24.281
and he's not afraid of ghosts.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.849
Well, guess what?
I get to keep the cash now.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.983
So take that, Derek,
and, you know, put it.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.898
♪ She's a mansion girl

13:31.941 --> 13:33.900
♪ She's so rich and she's hot

13:33.943 --> 13:36.119
♪ She's a mansion girl

13:36.163 --> 13:39.340
♪ With a kitchen island

13:39.383 --> 13:40.558
- Little pitchy.
- Still think

13:40.602 --> 13:41.951
Debbie's a good person?
- Not gonna lie,

13:41.995 --> 13:43.779
the whole dad reveal
did not help my case.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.867
All right, I'm gonna
use her burner phone

13:44.911 --> 13:46.782
to call the Nine-Nine.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.915
- Look what I found.
Do you like it, Jake?

13:48.958 --> 13:50.830
- Uh, yes! I love it.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.483
Real Cruella de Vil vibes.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.224
- No, no, no.
I'm not Cruella de Vil.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.009
I would never hurt dogs.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.401
I'm Perdita!
- Who?

13:57.445 --> 14:00.230
- The romantic lead
of the film.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.058
Pongo's wife.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.886
The girl dog.
- Yes, yes!

14:03.930 --> 14:06.193
Of course,
you look exactly like Perdita.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.456
- Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

14:16.943 --> 14:17.900
- Hey Debbie?
- Hm?

14:17.944 --> 14:19.249
- Will you hand me your phone

14:19.293 --> 14:20.903
so I can take your picture
and you can Gram this?

14:20.947 --> 14:22.905
- I mean, the house, this coat,

14:22.949 --> 14:24.559
you're gonna wanna
show this off to people, right?

14:24.602 --> 14:26.169
- That is such a good idea.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.171
I do wanna show off to people.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.433
I just have to
make a quick call.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.435
Hi, Mom.
Do you like my mansion?

14:31.479 --> 14:33.394
- Deborah Lyn,
why are you holding a gun?

14:33.437 --> 14:36.223
- Oh, my God, Mom!
I'm wearing a fur coat

14:36.266 --> 14:37.528
and that's what you focus on?

14:37.572 --> 14:40.270
I hate you so freaking much.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.055
- This is ridiculous.
Neither of you

14:42.098 --> 14:43.447
have even taken
a bathroom break.

14:43.491 --> 14:44.753
- Are you kidding me?

14:44.796 --> 14:46.537
Do you think
world record-holder Howard Berg

14:46.581 --> 14:49.279
would stop in the middle
of a read-off to expel?

14:49.323 --> 14:50.585
-  Ow.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.848
- What's going on, Santiago?
- It's nothing.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.459
It's my guide finger.
I've got paper burn.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.287
- Let me see.
- Hm.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.550
- Santiago, you're hurt.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.901
Don't be a hero.

15:04.164 --> 15:05.905
- Damn.
You must've been cooking.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.428
- I was.
- Let's take a break,

15:07.471 --> 15:09.125
put some ointment on that.
- Right. And when I come back,

15:09.169 --> 15:11.432
my finger's slipping
all over the page.

15:11.475 --> 15:14.478
Nice try. I'm not falling
for any of your tricks.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.176
- Oh, but you already have.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.482
While you were waggling
your finger in the air,

15:18.526 --> 15:21.094
I've been reading all this time
out of the corner of my eye.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.182
- Damn it!

15:22.225 --> 15:23.879
- Why are you doing this,
Deborah Lyn?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.837
- Because you're being
so mean, Mom.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.274
Also, I know that
if I didn't tie you up,

15:27.317 --> 15:28.884
you'd probably go
run and find your phone

15:28.928 --> 15:31.321
so you could call Derek.
- Maybe we should call Derek.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.933
He could help. He's a lawyer.
- Yeah, I know he's a lawyer.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.369
Do you think you could go
more than five minutes

15:35.412 --> 15:36.500
without bringing that up?

15:36.544 --> 15:38.502
- You have to get
the gun from her.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.287
- I know, but how do I
get close enough?

15:40.330 --> 15:42.071
- There's one way. She clearly
has a thing for you.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.290
- Why do you say that?
Just because

15:43.333 --> 15:45.118
she has a fantasy of us
as a dog couple?

15:45.161 --> 15:47.511
Wait. Yeah, I see it.
That's gonna work.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.644
- Very tacky. And it's like,
you don't even care

15:49.687 --> 15:51.037
how many chimneys I have.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.516
- Hey, sorry to interrupt.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.214
Mrs. Fogle,
we weren't introduced.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.172
I'm Jake, Debbie's boyfriend.

15:56.216 --> 15:59.436
- You are? We are?
- I mean, yeah,

15:59.480 --> 16:02.352
if you're into it.
- I am. I do.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.528
See, Mom. I am with someone.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.095
All those psychics were wrong.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.489
- So listen, babe--
- Yes, babe?

16:08.532 --> 16:10.186
- I was thinking--
- About what, babe?

16:10.230 --> 16:11.535
- That we--
- Go on, babe.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.015
- Wow, you really latched onto
the babe thing.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.364
- I love it.
- Great, great, great.

16:14.408 --> 16:15.800
Well, anyways,
I was just gonna say

16:15.844 --> 16:17.193
that, you know, once we're done
with this big score,

16:17.237 --> 16:18.412
we need a place to hide out.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.196
Somewhere where the cops
could never find us.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.634
- Ooh, like Epcot.
- Uhh, yes, Epcot is great.

16:23.678 --> 16:24.853
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.377
- We can kiss in front of
the Eiffel Tower,

16:27.421 --> 16:28.944
on the canals of Venice,

16:28.988 --> 16:30.902
oh, in the Canada pavilion.

16:30.946 --> 16:33.209
- Yes, but why wait
till the Canada Pavilion

16:33.253 --> 16:35.037
when we can start right now?

16:35.081 --> 16:36.038
Huh?
- Oh, my God.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.562
This is happening.
- Come here.

16:38.606 --> 16:39.650
Eh--

16:39.694 --> 16:41.478
- Hi-ya!

16:41.522 --> 16:45.047
What the hell, babe?

16:45.526 --> 16:47.223
- Debbie,
what's your plan here?

16:47.267 --> 16:48.268
Talk to me.
- Why? So you can

16:48.311 --> 16:49.791
just tell me
more beautiful lies?

16:49.834 --> 16:51.488
You think you can
just lick your lips

16:51.532 --> 16:54.100
and make me weak in the knees?
- No.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.017
- Nice try,
but I closed my eyes

16:58.060 --> 16:59.105
so I didn't even see it.

16:59.148 --> 17:00.149
- Oh, come on.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.804
- Oh. Nucci's on his way.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.066
And I'm about to be rich.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.502
- Debbie, this is bad.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.461
You don't wanna be
an accessory to murder.

17:07.504 --> 17:08.723
- W-what are you talking about?

17:08.766 --> 17:09.854
- What do you think
is gonna happen

17:09.898 --> 17:11.508
when Nucci gets here
and finds two cops?

17:11.552 --> 17:13.554
He's gonna kills us.

17:13.597 --> 17:14.772
- Yeah, I know that.

17:14.816 --> 17:17.079
Um, I've obviously thought
all this through,

17:17.123 --> 17:21.083
and it all is going
according to my plans.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.085
I'm sorry,
I just started trembling

17:23.129 --> 17:25.087
and I accidentally--

17:25.131 --> 17:27.959
- Debbie, please,
just put the gun down!

17:28.003 --> 17:29.744
- I just talked to the manager
at the hotel

17:29.787 --> 17:30.788
where the handoff
was happening.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.051
He said Debbie's room
was empty,

17:32.094 --> 17:33.791
and there's no sign
of Rosa or Jake.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.271
Is there anything
in those diaries

17:35.315 --> 17:36.707
that can help us find 'em?
- Debbie mentioned her mom

17:36.751 --> 17:38.100
a bunch in one of
the ones I read.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.101
Seems like
she tells her everything.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.581
- Ooh, that's a good lead.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.104
- It is a good lead, isn't it?

17:42.148 --> 17:43.758
Did you hear that,
speed freaks?

17:43.801 --> 17:45.586
- Let's find out all we can
about the mom.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.109
- I'll start reading
right away

17:47.153 --> 17:49.503
because slow and steady wins--
- Her mother's name

17:49.546 --> 17:51.113
is Margaret Jean Fogle.
- She lives in Bensonhurst.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.115
- She drives a maroon Lexus.
- Vanity plates, "DEREKSMOM."

17:53.159 --> 17:54.464
- She's been married
three times.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.944
- To Horace Mills.
- Then Frank Yelter.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.250
- And then James Fogle.
- She goes grocery shopping

17:57.293 --> 17:58.729
on Tuesdays.
- Water aerobics on Wednesdays.

17:58.773 --> 17:59.991
- Book club on Fridays.
- She drinks too much wine.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.429
- Always a pinot grigio.
- Always from Napa.

18:02.472 --> 18:05.693
- The race.
Slow and steady wins the race.

18:05.736 --> 18:08.783
- Okay, uh, what if I just
tell Nucci not to kill you?

18:08.826 --> 18:10.089
You know,
we're business partners,

18:10.132 --> 18:11.873
we make all of our
business decisions together.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.483
- Yep,
we're all gonna die today.

18:13.527 --> 18:14.702
- Debbie, if you just untie us,

18:14.745 --> 18:16.051
we can help you
get out of here.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.574
- Okay, but if I untie you,
you'll arrest me,

18:17.618 --> 18:18.967
and then I'll go to prison
for the rest of my life.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.229
- You'll be in prison anyway.

18:20.273 --> 18:21.796
I guarantee you
if anything happens to us,

18:21.839 --> 18:23.058
the Nine-Nine
will hunt you down.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.755
- Okay, okay, okay.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.453
Maybe I should surrender.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.150
Uh, but I don't wanna
go to jail.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.804
Okay, I don't know what to do.

18:29.847 --> 18:30.979
Um, Mom, help me.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.241
- Now you need my help?

18:32.285 --> 18:34.591
Please, it doesn't matter
what I say.

18:34.635 --> 18:35.766
You're still gonna mess it up.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.159
Just like you messed up
your bangs

18:37.203 --> 18:38.639
when you had to cut
your own hair.

18:38.682 --> 18:39.901
- Yeah, I'm sure that was
a long time ago.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.120
- That was last year.
- I see.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.904
- Or when you got
in a car accident

18:42.947 --> 18:44.514
when your brother
was going to take the bar.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.516
Or when you lost all your money

18:46.560 --> 18:48.823
investing in that cruise line
for cats.

18:48.866 --> 18:50.259
- Feline Cruise Line.
- You know what?

18:50.303 --> 18:52.914
You're not my daughter anymore.
- What?

18:52.957 --> 18:55.569
What are you saying?
- You have embarrassed me

18:55.612 --> 18:57.527
and the family
for the last time.

18:57.571 --> 19:02.576
I'm done with you. Good-bye.
- Shut up, Margaret!

19:02.619 --> 19:04.143
Same crap my parents pulled.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.101
Always pointing out my flaws,
never helping

19:06.145 --> 19:08.234
and then bailing
when things got messy.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.149
You know, I was a lot like you.
- You were holed up

19:10.192 --> 19:12.194
with a ton of cocaine
and a bunch of guns?

19:12.238 --> 19:13.674
- That's my business.
- What?

19:13.717 --> 19:15.197
- I spent years telling myself

19:15.241 --> 19:16.633
that tough love
made me stronger,

19:16.677 --> 19:17.982
but you know what I really wish
they'd done?

19:18.026 --> 19:20.681
- What?
- Been nice to me.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.204
I wish they would've told me
I made a mistake,

19:22.248 --> 19:23.684
but they still loved me

19:23.727 --> 19:26.600
and they would help me
try to figure it out.

19:26.643 --> 19:27.992
Would've saved me
a lot of pain.

19:28.036 --> 19:31.082
Debbie, you have made
some really bad choices today.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.084
- Really bad.
- Not now, Debbie's mom.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.609
- You are not a bad person.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.088
If we get out of this alive,
I promise you

19:37.132 --> 19:39.569
I will help you however I can.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.919
- Wow. Thank you.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.580
- Oh, your back is very wet.

19:50.624 --> 19:51.973
- Yeah, I guess between
the fur coat

19:52.016 --> 19:53.583
and all the cocaine,
I've been sweating a lot.

19:54.628 --> 19:55.977
- That's Nucci. He's here.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.721
- Hi, Debbie.
Do you have something for me?

20:00.764 --> 20:03.593
- Yes, I do.
I do have something.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.859
I have two friends.
- What the hell is this?

20:08.903 --> 20:11.558
- Drop your weapons.
- No way.

20:11.601 --> 20:14.256
You drop your weapons.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.304
- NYPD!
Everyone down on the ground!

20:18.347 --> 20:20.001
Down on the ground,
right now!

20:21.916 --> 20:23.309
- Put 'em down.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.267
- Don't do anything stupid.
- I will shoot her.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.877
Put down your gun.
- Oh, man,

20:26.921 --> 20:28.270
grabbing Debbie
was a big mistake.

20:28.314 --> 20:29.793
- What do you mean by--

20:29.837 --> 20:32.100
- Hi-ya!

20:32.143 --> 20:34.581
- Whoa, Debbie,
that was amazing.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.235
- Thanks. By the way,

20:36.278 --> 20:37.801
Jake thinks
you smell like .

20:37.845 --> 20:39.934
- What? That's weird.
I don't know why she said that.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.066
Anyways, let's get Debbie
into a cop car.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.635
Well, you really
gonna help out Debbie

20:45.679 --> 20:47.246
or did you just say all
that stuff so she'd let us go?

20:47.289 --> 20:49.770
- I told the DA she cooperated
and he agreed to be lenient,

20:49.813 --> 20:51.902
especially since we got Nucci
and the cocaine was returned.

20:51.946 --> 20:53.295
Except for the pound of it
that Debbie did.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.036
- Yeah. The paramedic said
he had never heard

20:55.079 --> 20:56.298
a human heart beat that loudly.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.691
He could hear it
outside of her body.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.867
- Ugh. She'll probably
get ten years.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.390
It's better than 30.
Let's be real,

21:01.434 --> 21:03.131
Debbie's life wasn't gonna
begin till she was 50 anyway.

21:03.174 --> 21:04.306
- Yeah, the kooky aunt vibe

21:04.350 --> 21:05.829
will probably
play a lot better then.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.005
So hey, one more thing.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.880
We can never let anyone know
that we got beat up

21:12.923 --> 21:14.098
by Debbie Fogle.
- Agreed.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.186
- Take it to the grave?
- To the grave.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.187
- This conversation
never happened.

21:16.231 --> 21:17.319
- I don't even know
who you are.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.538
- That's hurtful.
You took it too far.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.148
- That's a weird thing
for a stranger to say.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.715
Bye.

21:21.758 --> 21:22.716
- Okay.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.805
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
