WEBVTT

00:21.625 --> 00:23.500
Okay, it's bottom-line time.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.958
Who are you people, and what is all this?

00:25.958 --> 00:28.375
You've got questions.
That's understandable.

00:28.375 --> 00:31.458
Yeah, starting with,
"What the hell's TCB?"

00:31.458 --> 00:32.750
All in good time.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.416
Which happens to be right now.

00:36.916 --> 00:38.333
- Have a seat, sir.
- Who's this?

00:38.333 --> 00:41.583
Oh, you're not the only connoisseur
of exotic pets.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.916
This is mine. His name's Doyle.

00:43.916 --> 00:47.666
- I actually went to Columbia Law School.
- And now he picks up my dry cleaning.

00:47.666 --> 00:49.541
So, yeah, joke's on me.

00:49.541 --> 00:50.791
Yes, it is.

00:50.791 --> 00:51.750
Shall we?

00:51.750 --> 00:55.250
Did somebody order a total mindfuck?

00:55.250 --> 00:58.291
- I thought we told you no more robes.
- Yeah, but come on!

00:58.291 --> 01:02.916
How many times does a neighbor die
who wears the exact same size as me?

01:02.916 --> 01:05.750
Whoa, now, hang on.
What the hell is that thing?

01:05.750 --> 01:09.666
A little something I call
"enhanced being-there-ness."

01:09.666 --> 01:12.291
I thought we were calling it
"virtual reality."

01:12.791 --> 01:16.416
"Virtual reality"?
That's literally an oxymoron.

01:16.416 --> 01:19.000
Maybe try not being that stupid?

01:20.583 --> 01:22.791
Now, just relax.

01:41.875 --> 01:42.791
What the hell?

01:42.791 --> 01:45.000
<i>Hi there. Welcome to TCB.</i>

01:46.041 --> 01:46.916
<i>What's TCB?</i>

01:46.916 --> 01:49.166
<i>Well, it stands for "The Central Bureau,"</i>

01:49.166 --> 01:53.541
<i>and it's been keeping America safe
since long before you kids were even born.</i>

01:53.541 --> 01:55.375
<i>Huh? How so?</i>

01:55.375 --> 01:56.791
<i>Put it this way.</i>

01:56.791 --> 01:58.750
<i>If it wasn't for TCB,</i>

01:58.750 --> 02:01.750
<i>half of you'd be toiling
in a Japanese salt mine right now,</i>

02:01.750 --> 02:04.541
<i>and the other half
would be selling fetish sex for food</i>

02:04.541 --> 02:06.583
<i>in a Soviet worker's paradise.</i>

02:06.583 --> 02:08.916
<i>What's fetish sex?</i>

02:10.125 --> 02:11.500
<i>Kids are so stupid.</i>

02:12.250 --> 02:13.833
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

02:14.333 --> 02:18.791
<i>I am the Commander, the latest in a long,
illustrious line of TCB commanders</i>

02:18.791 --> 02:22.708
<i>who have quietly shaped history
into the very world you live in today.</i>

02:23.208 --> 02:25.791
<i>All through the secret power of TCB.</i>

02:27.250 --> 02:31.000
<i>1952. World's first hydrogen bomb.</i>

02:31.000 --> 02:33.041
<i>We checked a big box with that one.</i>

02:33.041 --> 02:35.041
<i>At the time, many asked, "Why?"</i>

02:35.041 --> 02:37.125
<i>But at TCB, we ask,</i>

02:37.791 --> 02:39.166
<i>"Why the hell not?"</i>

02:40.250 --> 02:43.708
<i>But our technology is nothing
without the secret agents to use it.</i>

02:43.708 --> 02:46.000
<i>And that's where you come in.</i>

02:47.500 --> 02:50.750
<i>Now, if you're watching this,
that means you're probably pretty famous.</i>

02:50.750 --> 02:52.375
<i>Congrats on that, by the way.</i>

02:52.375 --> 02:53.958
<i>And not just for the fame,</i>

02:53.958 --> 02:57.291
<i>but more importantly,
for the will to succeed.</i>

02:57.875 --> 03:00.125
<i>The kind of iron will that says</i>

03:00.125 --> 03:04.708
<i>you'll kill what you love and eat it
in a snow cave just to stay alive.</i>

03:04.708 --> 03:09.000
<i>Because that's what it takes
to be a celebrity in America.</i>

03:10.333 --> 03:12.916
<i>Oh, doors opened wide
for people like Marilyn,</i>

03:12.916 --> 03:14.875
<i>just like they do for you.</i>

03:14.875 --> 03:19.208
<i>And that's why for over 100 years,
TCB has utilized celebrities</i>

03:19.208 --> 03:24.583
<i>to infiltrate, instigate, appropriate,
and if this thing in Prague works out,</i>

03:24.583 --> 03:26.791
<i>fumigate to keep America safe.</i>

03:32.083 --> 03:33.000
<i>Ben Franklin?</i>

03:34.750 --> 03:36.583
<i>That guy was fucking dark.</i>

03:37.166 --> 03:40.250
<i>And like him, as a celebrity,
you're an influencer.</i>

03:40.250 --> 03:42.500
<i>What you think matters to the world,</i>

03:42.500 --> 03:44.666
<i>which is just one of the many ways</i>

03:44.666 --> 03:48.375
<i>TCB has quietly shaped the world
into what it is today.</i>

03:48.375 --> 03:49.833
<i>You're welcome.</i>

03:49.833 --> 03:54.916
<i>But remember, at TCB, we don't
just bend civilization to our will,</i>

03:55.416 --> 03:56.666
<i>we also like to have fun!</i>

03:57.583 --> 03:59.541
<i>We even have an annual company retreat.</i>

04:00.083 --> 04:01.541
<i>But not at the beach anymore.</i>

04:01.541 --> 04:05.708
<i>The last time we tried that, it turned
into what you know as the Bay of Pigs.</i>

04:05.708 --> 04:07.958
<i>- So, lesson learned.</i>

04:07.958 --> 04:09.625
<i>So, welcome to the team.</i>

04:09.625 --> 04:12.791
<i>And remember,
you're not just a celebrity anymore.</i>

04:12.791 --> 04:16.166
<i>You're a gladiator for American greatness.</i>

04:18.416 --> 04:21.416
<i>Dear God, their abs are like
a basket of snakes.</i>

04:23.791 --> 04:26.125
And, what, you expect me
to believe all that?

04:26.708 --> 04:29.208
I think you and I both know
you already do.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.083
So, what do you think?

04:32.875 --> 04:33.916
Kick-ass spy gadgets?

04:33.916 --> 04:35.208
Kind of the whole point.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.583
Saving America?

04:36.583 --> 04:37.958
Practically every day.

04:37.958 --> 04:39.041
Insanely dangerous?

04:39.041 --> 04:43.458
I can almost guarantee
a very abrupt, violent death.

04:45.375 --> 04:47.333
Your training starts soon. Be ready.

04:48.208 --> 04:50.875
Guess I'll be seeing you around,
CeCe with an "E."

04:50.875 --> 04:52.833
Uh, hang on.
You can't leave with that suit.

04:52.833 --> 04:53.875
Need that back.

04:53.875 --> 04:56.458
I've been to the moon and back
in this thing.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.458
Pretty sure I earned it.

04:58.458 --> 05:02.125

05:16.666 --> 05:19.875

05:19.875 --> 05:21.458
Oh come on.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.375
Who doesn't love Elvis?

05:23.375 --> 05:25.208
That man's a menace.

05:25.208 --> 05:28.000
He looks like
a male prostitute hairdresser.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.000
But not too hard to look at.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.666
<i>♪ You can't move forward or back ♪</i>

05:56.666 --> 05:59.166

06:01.750 --> 06:03.166
Over 50%.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.333
Hold on a second.

06:10.666 --> 06:12.458
Ensign. Are you okay?

06:13.208 --> 06:15.416
That woman looks ridiculous.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.958
Who even dresses like that
flying around the galaxy?

06:19.541 --> 06:24.333
Ooh, looks like jealousy wears
a jungle cat-themed pantsuit in... Ow!

06:24.333 --> 06:25.416
I don't do jealous.

06:25.416 --> 06:28.166
I still can't believe
you and Captain Kirk are a thing.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.833
Well...

06:29.833 --> 06:33.083
Okay, we're not really dating.

06:33.083 --> 06:36.000
Although the other night, I did let him--

06:36.000 --> 06:38.375
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- No, thank you.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.541
No, thanks. [laughs] I'm good.

06:40.541 --> 06:42.833
What is wrong with you? Grow up.

06:42.833 --> 06:47.000
Which I'd like to continue to do
without images like that in my head.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah, that's like
walking in on your parents butt-naked,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.625
but they're both
getting boned by Captain Kirk.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.958
- And nobody needs that.

06:54.958 --> 06:56.208
 Speak for yourself.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.708
<i>Sorry to interrupt.</i>

06:57.708 --> 06:59.916
What? What in the hell is this?

06:59.916 --> 07:01.916
<i>Ah, Miss Bertie, I presume.</i>

07:01.916 --> 07:03.500
Let me guess.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.791
You're the jackass
who runs the stupid little secret club

07:06.791 --> 07:10.583
that almost got my precious Elvis
killed in a nuclear fireball.

07:10.583 --> 07:12.166
<i>God, I love your strength.</i>

07:12.166 --> 07:15.250
<i>And he wasn't almost killed.</i>

07:15.250 --> 07:17.958
<i>Technically, he was slightly killed.</i>

07:17.958 --> 07:19.750
<i>-Based on radiation--
- Howard!</i>

07:20.541 --> 07:23.500
<i>Are you ready?
Because your training starts now.</i>

07:23.500 --> 07:25.291
Training? What are you talking about?

07:25.291 --> 07:27.041
<i>We're sending you on your first mission.</i>

07:27.041 --> 07:29.208
What? Hold the phone, jackass.

07:29.208 --> 07:34.000
Sending him on his first mission is,
by definition, not training.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.125
<i>Well, at TCB, we train by not training.</i>

07:37.125 --> 07:40.000
You actually think those words make sense?

07:40.000 --> 07:43.958
<i>We train by doing.
By throwing you in the deep end.</i>

07:43.958 --> 07:46.458
<i>Same way Vikings
taught their babies how to swim.</i>

07:46.458 --> 07:48.166
<i>And most of them probably did fine.</i>

07:48.166 --> 07:51.708
Oh, so you think
you can just waltz right into my TV,

07:51.708 --> 07:55.708
interrupting Bertie's <i>Star Trek,</i>
and send me out on some mission?

07:55.708 --> 07:58.125
<i>Did I mention a jetpack may be involved?</i>

07:58.125 --> 08:00.000
- Where are we headed?
<i>- Familiar with Altamont?</i>

08:00.000 --> 08:02.500
- What's that? Some kind of Buick?
<i>-</i> No, man.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.375
It's like the Woodstock of the West,
up in San Fran.

08:05.375 --> 08:08.375
They're calling it
the Summer of Love all over again.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.125
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

08:10.125 --> 08:13.291
Hippie orgy concert kind of shindig.
Got it.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.958
<i>Indeed. And you'll get briefed
when you get to it.</i>

08:15.958 --> 08:18.875
<i>Oh, and maybe wear something
a little less... you.</i>

08:18.875 --> 08:20.291
Watch your speed.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.875
<i>They're filming a documentary up there.</i>

08:21.875 --> 08:25.125
<i>Gonna be cameras around,
so just make sure you blend.</i>

08:30.791 --> 08:31.875
You know what?

08:31.875 --> 08:34.541
I actually make this look not ridiculous.

08:34.541 --> 08:36.458
Yep, and not for nothing.

08:36.458 --> 08:37.833
Pete Fonda's still calling,

08:37.833 --> 08:39.916
asking when he's getting
these motorcycles back.

08:39.916 --> 08:40.916
What'd you tell him?

08:40.916 --> 08:42.416
"What motorcycles?"

08:42.416 --> 08:43.375
Good man.

08:45.541 --> 08:47.666
Whoa. Hang on, E.

08:47.666 --> 08:51.958
I thought this was gonna be, you know,
just you and me cruising up the coast.

08:51.958 --> 08:54.625
Kind of a guy's trip, as in not the...

08:55.708 --> 08:59.083
...chimp who just threatened to kill me
in three different fucking ways.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.458
Yeah, well, right back at you,
you furry little fuck!

09:07.083 --> 09:07.916
<i>Me again.</i>

09:07.916 --> 09:09.375
Oh dear Lord.

09:09.375 --> 09:10.791
<i>I'd like to circle back real quick</i>

09:10.791 --> 09:14.041
<i>on something from earlier
vis-à-vis you calling me a jackass,</i>

09:14.041 --> 09:16.750
<i>and maybe walk you through
why that doesn't happen.</i>

09:16.750 --> 09:19.500
Oh, I would, sweetie, but I can't

09:19.500 --> 09:21.125
because I don't want to.

09:22.958 --> 09:26.125
<i>That probably was not
the wisest course of action.</i>

09:26.125 --> 09:29.666
<i>Spock, can I borrow your ears
for Halloween?</i>

09:29.666 --> 09:32.583
<i>This year I wanna go
as an asshole in the peanut gallery.</i>

09:40.916 --> 09:42.541
- Oh!

09:55.916 --> 09:59.250
And to think this all started
with a kid named yours truly

09:59.250 --> 10:02.041
buying a seven-dollar guitar
at Tupelo Hardware.

10:02.041 --> 10:05.000
Good God. Guess we can go ahead
and check the healthy self-image box.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.125
Oh good. It's, uh... you.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.291
Fun outfit.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.125
I'm trying to blend.

10:14.791 --> 10:16.458
So, you're gonna tell me why I'm here?

10:18.541 --> 10:21.666
'Cause this is starting
to feel like a waste of my time.

10:23.083 --> 10:26.416
And like every conversation
I've ever had with Willie Nelson.

10:26.416 --> 10:28.000
By the way, is he dead?

10:31.875 --> 10:33.333
- Nope.
- Okay, here's the deal.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.791
Some unknown bad guys
stole some TCB technology

10:35.791 --> 10:38.708
and may have turned it
into a sort of sonic weapon.

10:38.708 --> 10:41.416
The Commander thinks it might be here.
Could be dangerous.

10:41.416 --> 10:44.000
- Dangerous how?
- I don't know. That's all we got so far.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.250
That's pretty damn vague.

10:45.833 --> 10:47.083
Which is half the fun!

10:47.083 --> 10:49.125
That and the monkey
who keeps giving me pot.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.791
- Keep your eyes out for anything weird.
- And the jetpack?

10:53.583 --> 10:55.125
I so knew you'd fall for that.

10:55.125 --> 10:56.458
Uh, yeah, there's no jetpack,

10:56.458 --> 10:58.958
but you do get one of these,
to stay in touch.

10:59.541 --> 11:01.083
Well, enjoy the show,

11:01.083 --> 11:05.291
which I couldn't help but notice
you were not invited to play, by the way.

11:05.291 --> 11:06.291
You can go now.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.750
The fucking diaper? Seriously?

11:11.708 --> 11:14.041
Not gonna wipe it off? Not even a little?

<i>I think we got off on the wrong foot.</i>

12:00.125 --> 12:02.625
Keep interrupting my damn stories!

12:02.625 --> 12:04.708
Man, all you got are wrong feet.

12:04.708 --> 12:06.833
<i>How about this? Let me buy you a drink.</i>

12:06.833 --> 12:09.166
Oh, I get it.

12:09.166 --> 12:10.375
<i>- What?</i>
- Ha!

12:10.375 --> 12:12.666
- You're one of those.
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

12:12.666 --> 12:16.166
A powerful man like you,
used to getting what you want.

12:16.833 --> 12:20.208
So you're secretly drawn
to women who crap all over you.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.458
<i>I'm really not.</i>

12:21.458 --> 12:22.541
Good for you, then.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.833
Now get your oddly-shaped head off my TV.

12:26.791 --> 12:28.083
<i>That was hot.</i>

12:29.000 --> 12:30.291
<i>Turns out I am.</i>

12:30.291 --> 12:32.083
<i>Come on. How about dinner?</i>

12:32.083 --> 12:34.791
<i>Drink, gas station popcorn. Something.</i>

12:36.583 --> 12:38.958
It's about more
than just sex and drugs, man.

12:38.958 --> 12:42.125
You know, this whole thing, man,
it's about being free, right?

12:42.125 --> 12:44.916
And I mean, like, with a capital "E."

12:45.833 --> 12:47.041
Hold that thought, Doug.

12:47.791 --> 12:49.291
How's the blending going?

12:49.791 --> 12:51.958
Yeah!

12:51.958 --> 12:53.583
- Best day ever--

12:55.500 --> 12:58.083
Yeah, my boy Doug says hi.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.041
Anything to report?

12:59.041 --> 13:02.083
<i>Yeah, what do you know
about the Hells Angels?</i>

13:02.083 --> 13:05.416
I know I dated one when I was 19
because my mom's a dick.

13:05.416 --> 13:08.833
And the ones by the stage,
they're working security for free beer,

13:08.833 --> 13:11.625
sort of pro bono
but for raging alcoholics.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.583
- Not them. The fake ones.
-  <i>What?</i>

13:14.583 --> 13:17.166
Those guys by the van
who are dressed like,

13:17.166 --> 13:19.958
but definitely are not, Hells Angels.

13:19.958 --> 13:22.000
-  How do you know that?
-  The jackets.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.416
They don't have chapter patches.
They're fake.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.083
- Oh my God.
-  Yeah.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.791
The Grateful Dead just got here.

13:29.791 --> 13:30.916
Back in a jiff.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.166
What the hell's a jiff?

13:33.166 --> 13:36.833
I don't know. How long it takes to meet/
maybe blow Jerry Garcia. You tell me.

13:36.833 --> 13:39.000
Seriously, I got plans.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.375
Are you calling me a liar?

13:40.375 --> 13:42.250
<i>No, no. Of course not.</i>

13:42.791 --> 13:44.833
<i>Though I have machines
that can tell if you're lying.</i>

13:44.833 --> 13:47.458
<i>Even a machine that can tell
if you're thinking about lying</i>

13:47.458 --> 13:49.916
<i>but are afraid to
because it's so scary-looking.</i>

13:49.916 --> 13:54.208
<i>And one that lies to itself
about being a machine.</i>

13:54.208 --> 13:57.041
<i>- But it committed suicide.</i>
-<i>Howard!</i>

14:01.666 --> 14:03.166
Can't be back here, little lady.

14:03.166 --> 14:04.083
Says who?

14:04.083 --> 14:05.541
Me.

14:05.541 --> 14:06.500
Just now.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.708
Yeah, I didn't mean it literally, dumbass.

14:08.708 --> 14:11.500
It's a cliché.
You know, like, don't look now, but...

14:13.875 --> 14:16.541
Whoa, whoa, hang on.
How'd you get past security?

14:16.541 --> 14:18.250
Uh, quickly. Where the hell's the band?

14:18.250 --> 14:20.541
- Not here yet.
- But I saw their helicopter land outside.

14:20.541 --> 14:23.750
Yeah, which they're currently
getting high inside of.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.000
God, I should have been in a band.

14:28.833 --> 14:31.333
Sorry, pal. Off-limits back here.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.833
You want to try that again?

14:32.833 --> 14:34.291
Holy shit. Hey...

14:34.291 --> 14:37.500
Hey! Hey, you're Elvis Presley.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.416
So they tell me.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.416
All right, lady, look, you need to leave.

14:41.416 --> 14:43.541
Relax. Jerry and I go way back.

14:43.541 --> 14:45.291
Assuming recurring sex dreams count.

14:45.291 --> 14:47.041
- What?
- Oh my God. It's so amazing.

14:47.041 --> 14:50.291
Middle of the night, he breaks into
my house, he's dressed as Santa Claus.

14:50.291 --> 14:52.958
And then he chokes me out in my shower,
but it's in a hot way.

14:52.958 --> 14:56.083
You know what? You're not his type, okay?
Come on, let's go.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.500
Oh, he's into dudes?
That's cool. I can work with that.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.125
Nope. Nope. Not gonna happen.

15:01.125 --> 15:03.583
But if you're interested in sex
with any of the other bands,

15:03.583 --> 15:05.458
- you can take a number.
- Excuse me?

15:05.458 --> 15:07.666
I mean literally,
in the groupie trailer next door.

15:07.666 --> 15:10.583
The first page is a waiver.
Read it carefully.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.208
A "Cleveland Steamer"? Seriously?

15:13.208 --> 15:14.791
Yeah.

15:14.791 --> 15:15.875
Not a fucking chance.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.958
Sorry, lady. Rules are rules.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.041
I am an independent,
empowered feminist woman,

15:21.041 --> 15:24.791
which means I have meaningless sex
in trailers on my own terms all the time.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.458
I'm not sure that's what "feminist" means.

15:28.833 --> 15:30.541
Hey. Hey, Elvis.

15:30.541 --> 15:33.958
Hey, do you know
what my favorite Elvis song is?

15:33.958 --> 15:35.458
What? You only have one?

15:37.375 --> 15:38.416
Do I only...

15:39.416 --> 15:41.333
- Buddy, you're beautiful.
- What the...

15:47.833 --> 15:51.333
<i>♪ Goulet, Goulet  ♪</i>

15:53.125 --> 15:55.375
Scatter, 86 that bald prick!

16:25.291 --> 16:26.750
Still a big fan, I hope.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.083
Destroy that damn thing, Scatter!

16:44.000 --> 16:45.791
- Uh-huh.

16:45.791 --> 16:46.708
Okay.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.666
All right, the band's on their way.
You gotta go.

16:48.666 --> 16:50.916
- Way ahead of you, loser.
- Groupie trailer to the right.

16:50.916 --> 16:54.250
- Have a good time. Knock yourself out.
- I'd rather choke on a pile of dicks.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.791
That's actually in the waiver, by the way.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.166
- What...
- The hell?

17:11.125 --> 17:13.375
That dude was harshing the vibe here, man.

17:13.375 --> 17:15.041
And that's not cool.

17:15.041 --> 17:17.500
You know, you and your buddies
may not have a fucking clue,

17:17.500 --> 17:20.333
or own pants, apparently,
but you're all right.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.208
Anyone ever tell you
you kind of look like Elvis...

17:39.500 --> 17:41.041
What do you think you're doing?

17:41.041 --> 17:43.166
Oh, we're making
a documentary about the show.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.583
No, idiot. I mean,
catching me on my bad side.

17:47.791 --> 17:50.541
Whoa, someone looks like absolute shit.

17:50.541 --> 17:51.916
Where's the old man?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.666
- Huh.

18:03.083 --> 18:03.958
What are you doing?

18:03.958 --> 18:06.291
Talking on a phone
that smells like Scatter's junk

18:06.291 --> 18:08.083
and trying to do both our jobs.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.083
Now, you mind?

18:09.083 --> 18:10.750
- Shit.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.125
- Hey.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.583
Hey, Bobby Ray. Wake up.

18:13.583 --> 18:14.791
Wake up!

18:16.083 --> 18:18.000
Oh man, this is gonna be so cool.

18:19.791 --> 18:21.250
Ah! Ah!

18:21.250 --> 18:22.916
What the fuck? What the fuck?

18:22.916 --> 18:26.500
You want to tell me why there's a needle
the size of a fucking ninja sword

18:26.500 --> 18:27.708
sticking out of my head?

18:28.833 --> 18:29.916
Not really.

18:30.625 --> 18:31.833
You flown one of these before?

18:31.833 --> 18:35.291
No, but this thing's just
an upside-down riding lawn mower.

18:35.291 --> 18:36.250
I got this.

18:40.125 --> 18:40.958
Who are you again?

18:40.958 --> 18:42.416
I'm George. George Lucas.

18:42.416 --> 18:44.500
Okay. What are you doing?

18:44.500 --> 18:48.166
It's gone full-on insane out there,
so I'm hiding out here.

18:48.166 --> 18:49.250
Uh-huh.

18:49.250 --> 18:53.625
Well, George, from a safety standpoint,
I'm not sure you improved your lot.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.583
Yeah. Yeah. The lady may have a point.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.375
Time to mow the fucking lawn.

19:14.375 --> 19:15.291
Woo-hoo!

19:16.916 --> 19:18.916
Stay on target.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.583
- Ah!

19:36.583 --> 19:38.291
Hey, E! Here you go!

19:50.458 --> 19:52.166
Huh. Look at that.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.208
Looks like some kind of laser sword.

19:54.208 --> 19:55.708
More like a lightsaber.

19:55.708 --> 19:57.333
Yeah, that works too.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.791
Damn it.

20:03.458 --> 20:04.416
Here, hold this.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.125
The missions always like this?

20:23.625 --> 20:24.666
Only the good ones.

20:25.208 --> 20:26.833
<i>You know, well,</i>

20:26.833 --> 20:29.000
<i>hey, either way,
hope you have a good time tonight.</i>

20:29.000 --> 20:30.583
Oh, I plan to.

20:30.583 --> 20:33.916
<i>Okay, yeah. Well, but somehow
I doubt your dinner date will have</i>

20:33.916 --> 20:37.416
<i>the commanding and compelling
presence of, you know, yours truly.</i>

20:38.416 --> 20:39.583
Wanna bet?

20:42.958 --> 20:44.875
<i>Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.</i>

20:44.875 --> 20:46.333
<i>Captain Kirk? For real?</i>

20:51.333 --> 20:53.000
Hey, Elvis. How you doing?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Not now, Kirk.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.583
-  <i>What?</i>
- Well, you're in a mood.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.500
- Fucking Kirk.
<i>-</i> What are you talking about?

21:00.500 --> 21:03.041
- How'd it go?
- Elvis tracked down that sonic weapon,

21:03.041 --> 21:05.541
which makes people go fucking insane,
by the way.

21:05.541 --> 21:06.791
Where's the device?

21:06.791 --> 21:08.500
- Bottom of the ocean.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.291
Well, this day just keeps
turning to shit, doesn't it?

21:11.875 --> 21:13.458
Doyle! Come get a beating.

21:13.958 --> 21:15.083
<i>My pleasure, sir.</i>
