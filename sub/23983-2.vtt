WEBVTT

00:00.898 --> 00:02.397
Michael's been in the bathroom forever!

00:02.453 --> 00:04.250
Shouldn't I go check on him?
Maybe he needs help!

00:04.312 --> 00:06.580
Help with what? He's potty trained.

00:06.606 --> 00:08.531
I think. Wait, how old is he?

00:08.578 --> 00:10.096
Who was in the World Series
when I got Priya pregnant?

00:10.127 --> 00:12.093
Yankees/Marlins. He's 15.
We're fine. Let's play.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.995
Starks for three!

00:13.997 --> 00:16.498
<i>You missed, baby!
You must be distracted! Oops!</i>

00:16.500 --> 00:18.500
I can't take it anymore.
I'm gonna kick the door down.

00:18.502 --> 00:20.018
I can't have his death on my conscience!

00:20.043 --> 00:21.169
We're in the middle of a game.

00:21.171 --> 00:22.737
Oh, thank God, he didn't drown.

00:22.739 --> 00:24.973
Drown? You think I want
to end up like Natalie Wood?

00:24.975 --> 00:27.375
I mean, I do, but not the drowning part.

00:27.377 --> 00:29.644
- Can I help you?
- Hey, are you really

00:29.646 --> 00:31.182
just gonna drop your towel on the floor?

00:31.237 --> 00:32.369
Oh, where do you want me to drop it?

00:32.372 --> 00:33.638
Crazy idea, how about you

00:33.640 --> 00:35.173
don't drop it anywhere, and you just

00:35.175 --> 00:36.374
hang it in the bathroom?

00:36.376 --> 00:37.675
So the only person doing the cleaning

00:37.677 --> 00:39.777
in this apartment
is the person of color?

00:39.779 --> 00:42.313
- Not a good look.
<i>- Someone play me!</i>

00:42.315 --> 00:44.315
<i>I'm Pop-A-Shot!</i>

00:44.317 --> 00:46.317
What is that? It looks homophobic.

00:46.319 --> 00:48.686
What? That's our Pop-A-Shot
basketball game.

00:48.688 --> 00:50.655
Yeah, we've had it
since we were teenagers.

00:50.657 --> 00:52.824
You know what? My interest has waned.

00:52.826 --> 00:54.292
Now, here's what I want to know.

00:54.294 --> 00:55.793
When am I going to get my own bedroom?

00:55.795 --> 00:57.028
The sofa bed stoinks.

00:57.030 --> 00:58.629
Well, maybe it wouldn't "stoink"

00:58.631 --> 01:00.965
if you didn't treat the
living room like a shanty town.

01:00.967 --> 01:02.700
Look, I can't clean, okay?

01:02.702 --> 01:03.801
I have too much going on!

01:03.803 --> 01:05.570
New school, new parents,

01:05.572 --> 01:07.805
eating vegetables
for the first time ever.

01:07.807 --> 01:08.973
It's fine, all right?

01:08.975 --> 01:10.341
- I'll clean up after him.
- No.

01:10.343 --> 01:11.943
Look how tiny his clothes are.

01:11.945 --> 01:13.311
It's like I finally got a Build-A-Bear.

01:13.313 --> 01:15.246
You know, I was thinking, that, um,

01:15.248 --> 01:17.882
maybe after school I could get
a formal tour of the gym.

01:17.884 --> 01:19.517
Like my grand unveiling.

01:19.519 --> 01:22.553
All I need is a marble
staircase and a chandelier.

01:22.555 --> 01:25.156
Absolutely, yeah, um...

01:25.158 --> 01:26.457
but not today.

01:26.459 --> 01:27.759
Uh, we're closed,

01:27.761 --> 01:29.961
because they... they found a body.

01:29.963 --> 01:31.429
- Ooh.
- Behind the gym.

01:31.431 --> 01:32.897
And it's white,

01:32.899 --> 01:34.766
so they actually want
to find out who did it.

01:34.768 --> 01:35.767
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

01:35.769 --> 01:37.001
- Okay.
- I know.

01:37.003 --> 01:38.087
- Only in New York...
- Yeah.

01:38.111 --> 01:39.470
Right, guys?

01:39.472 --> 01:40.838
- Bye!
- Yeah, see you!

01:40.840 --> 01:42.774
Okay, wait.

01:42.776 --> 01:44.142
That can't be true.

01:44.144 --> 01:46.310
We never close down the gym
for a dead body,

01:46.312 --> 01:47.478
regardless of race.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.746
Obviously I made that up, okay?

01:48.748 --> 01:49.847
It's just I still haven't figured out

01:49.849 --> 01:51.215
how to tell everyone at the gym

01:51.217 --> 01:52.316
that I've been hiding a son from them

01:52.318 --> 01:53.551
for 15 years,

01:53.553 --> 01:55.153
especially since
there's some other stuff

01:55.155 --> 01:56.354
that I haven't told them,

01:56.356 --> 01:58.550
like I sold the gym.

01:58.611 --> 02:00.322

02:03.797 --> 02:05.842
As your accountant, I have bad news.

02:05.905 --> 02:07.496
We'll take the good news first, Dana.

02:07.497 --> 02:09.297
- There is none.
- Can you make something up?

02:09.299 --> 02:10.698
- No.
- Just give us

02:10.699 --> 02:11.566
the bad news, please.

02:11.568 --> 02:13.167
When you sold Champions in secret

02:13.169 --> 02:14.402
to flee your responsibilities...

02:14.404 --> 02:15.937
To evade my responsibilities!

02:15.939 --> 02:17.705
Abruptly abandoning
your business and family...

02:17.707 --> 02:19.707
Knowing that my absence
would only make them stronger.

02:19.709 --> 02:21.442
- You began the escrow process.
- Mm-hmm.

02:21.444 --> 02:23.911
Now, in order to extricate
yourself with the bank,

02:23.913 --> 02:26.814
you'll need to pay a penalty of $5,000.

02:26.816 --> 02:28.216
- By Monday.
- Or what?

02:28.218 --> 02:29.517
Or you'll lose the gym

02:29.519 --> 02:30.918
and everyone will be out of a job.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.120
$5,000?

02:32.122 --> 02:33.621
How are we gonna come up with that?

02:33.623 --> 02:35.223
I can't go back
to "Thunder From Down Under."

02:35.225 --> 02:36.724
I'm bad at the accent!

02:36.726 --> 02:38.993
G'day, which lucky sheila

02:38.995 --> 02:40.795
wants a lap dance? Ugh!

02:40.797 --> 02:41.896
Matthew, Matthew, you're not gonna

02:41.898 --> 02:43.297
have to back to dancing.

02:43.299 --> 02:45.333
I hated knowing where
your dollar bills had been.

02:45.335 --> 02:46.734
Just do not tell staff.

02:46.736 --> 02:47.869
The last thing I need
is them freaking out

02:47.871 --> 02:49.370
that they might lose their jobs.

02:49.372 --> 02:51.405
Hey, morning, everyone.

02:51.407 --> 02:52.673
How you guys doing?

02:52.675 --> 02:53.975
Uncle Bud, looking cheerful.

02:53.977 --> 02:56.110
That I am. Check out
the houseboat I bought.

02:56.112 --> 02:57.612
It's called the "Crooked Hillary."

02:57.614 --> 02:59.180
Uncle Bud, why'd you buy a boat?

02:59.182 --> 03:01.415
Uh, my eyes aren't good enough

03:01.417 --> 03:02.917
to drive a car no more.

03:02.919 --> 03:04.852
You hit a dolphin, who cares?

03:04.854 --> 03:06.521
You drive into a newsstand,

03:06.523 --> 03:07.655
you're gonna hear about it.

03:07.657 --> 03:09.423
Uncle Bud, that is really smart.

03:09.425 --> 03:10.892
And also, I promised your dad

03:10.894 --> 03:12.460
right before he died, he said,

03:12.462 --> 03:14.362
"Bud, take care of my two boys."

03:14.364 --> 03:15.830
- Right.
- "And when your eyes go,

03:15.832 --> 03:17.899
buy a boat."

03:17.901 --> 03:18.633
Oh, man, Vince,

03:18.635 --> 03:20.301
what's your take on people making

03:20.303 --> 03:22.370
- risky purchases right now?
- Oh, I'm not worried.

03:22.372 --> 03:23.738
I invested all my money

03:23.740 --> 03:25.973
in the safest stock there is,

03:25.975 --> 03:27.308
Off-Broadway theater.

03:27.310 --> 03:28.876
That's smart too, Shabaz.

03:28.878 --> 03:31.179
It's a modern twist
on a Broadway classic.

03:31.181 --> 03:34.048
"Muhammad Christ Superstar."

03:34.050 --> 03:35.683
We've already gotten
a few threats, so...

03:35.685 --> 03:36.884
Vince, I really think you should

03:36.886 --> 03:38.152
pipe in any time now.

03:38.154 --> 03:39.420
Yeah, Vince, is this a bad time

03:39.422 --> 03:41.122
to Amazon Prime an indoor hot tub?

03:41.124 --> 03:43.124
No, no, everything's good.

03:43.126 --> 03:44.525
Everything's great, okay?

03:44.527 --> 03:46.060
All I wanna say is that
we're gonna be doing

03:46.062 --> 03:48.062
a membership drive this weekend.

03:48.064 --> 03:49.430
Let's make as much money as possible,

03:49.432 --> 03:51.599
but no less than exactly $5,000.

03:51.601 --> 03:52.659
You see? You see?

03:52.684 --> 03:54.335
That's the kind of business acumen

03:54.337 --> 03:55.903
that's gonna keep us and my boat

03:55.905 --> 03:57.171
afloat forever.

03:57.173 --> 03:59.273
Yes, yes, yes, yes to all, okay?

03:59.275 --> 04:00.775
Now, let's go sign up some customers.

04:00.777 --> 04:02.243
- Yeah!
- Do it. Let's do it, yeah.

04:02.245 --> 04:03.711
- All right.
- Okay.

04:03.713 --> 04:05.780
All right, let's go,
I mean, look at this here.

04:08.585 --> 04:09.817
Hello?

04:09.819 --> 04:10.818
- Hey.
- Ah!

04:10.820 --> 04:12.286
Oh! Britney!

04:12.288 --> 04:13.688
- Damn it, it's me.
- Vince!

04:13.690 --> 04:15.089
What the hell is wrong with you?

04:15.091 --> 04:16.891
Did you hear they found
a white body back here?

04:16.892 --> 04:18.259
Yeah, I made that up, okay?

04:18.261 --> 04:19.694
Look, I need you to do me a favor.

04:19.696 --> 04:21.762
Ha! Me? Do you a favor?

04:21.764 --> 04:22.930
After you dumped me,

04:22.932 --> 04:24.265
I found out you had a love child,

04:24.267 --> 04:25.299
and you sold the gym?

04:25.301 --> 04:26.500
You're a psycho.

04:26.502 --> 04:28.269
You're like Robert Durst, but poor.

04:28.271 --> 04:30.438
Look, I need you to not
tell anyone about the gym

04:30.440 --> 04:32.073
- or about Michael.
- Who?

04:32.075 --> 04:34.375
My secret son, you just mentioned him.

04:34.377 --> 04:35.409
- Oh.
- Look, I'll do anything

04:35.411 --> 04:36.544
you want, okay?

04:36.546 --> 04:38.913
I-I can give you upwards of...

04:38.915 --> 04:39.881
$8.

04:39.883 --> 04:41.949
No, I want to use the gym
for a launch party

04:41.951 --> 04:43.384
for the new vodka I'm promoting.

04:43.386 --> 04:44.652
- What?
- You absorb it

04:44.654 --> 04:46.654
- through your colon.
- Wait, you...

04:46.656 --> 04:48.055
You drink it through your butt?

04:48.057 --> 04:49.390
It's called Posterier.

04:49.392 --> 04:50.591
- Okay.
- Absorb the night.

04:50.593 --> 04:51.792
All right, fine, yeah, use the gym.

04:51.794 --> 04:53.194
- Great!
- Hey, can I at least

04:53.196 --> 04:57.131
come to the party?

04:58.768 --> 05:01.502
Dear God, please take care
of my mother in Cleveland,

05:01.504 --> 05:02.803
which is not a great place

05:02.805 --> 05:04.372
to be as a single Indian woman.

05:04.374 --> 05:06.173
And if you have any time left over,

05:06.175 --> 05:08.276
I would dearly ask for my own bedroom

05:08.278 --> 05:10.177
so I don't have to sleep on a sofa bed

05:10.179 --> 05:12.446
on public display like
a zoo animal and...

05:12.448 --> 05:14.649
Amen. Good night, Michael.

05:14.651 --> 05:17.818
Vince, a word, please.

05:18.922 --> 05:20.521
Maybe I should be the one praying.

05:20.523 --> 05:22.123
You know how much
I hate lying to people.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.858
Last year on Halloween,
I went as Matthew.

05:23.860 --> 05:25.092
You're not lying.

05:25.094 --> 05:26.961
We're gonna get the $5,000 by Monday,

05:26.963 --> 05:28.162
and by then, I'll have figured out

05:28.164 --> 05:29.430
how to tell everyone about Michael.

05:29.432 --> 05:31.332
Ah! Help!

05:31.334 --> 05:33.067
- Michael!
- Matthew!

05:33.069 --> 05:35.569
The sofa bed ate my nephew!

05:35.572 --> 05:38.006
- Help! Help!
- Michael, we're coming!

05:38.007 --> 05:39.957

05:57.242 --> 05:58.608
You kneed me in the balls last night.

05:58.610 --> 06:00.143
You kneed me in the balls last night.

06:00.145 --> 06:01.511
Well, we're either gonna have to buy

06:01.513 --> 06:03.113
kneepads or ball pads, because this is

06:03.115 --> 06:04.481
our life now, until Michael gets married

06:04.483 --> 06:05.982
to a wonderful man and moves out.

06:05.984 --> 06:07.917
Now go to your room and get dressed.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.327
Uh... why does the kitchen
look like this?

06:17.329 --> 06:18.928
Oh, I was getting a glass of water

06:18.930 --> 06:20.563
when I got a notification.

06:20.565 --> 06:21.831
Apparently Meghan Markle is not

06:21.833 --> 06:22.999
getting along with the queen's corgis.

06:23.001 --> 06:24.634
They can tell she did basic cable.

06:24.636 --> 06:26.102
All right, we've got some

06:26.104 --> 06:27.804
pretty bad traits in our family...

06:27.806 --> 06:29.606
high cholesterol,
low-level depression...

06:29.608 --> 06:31.875
- Lightning-quick erections.
- Let's not advertise that one.

06:31.877 --> 06:33.677
But this I've never seen.

06:33.679 --> 06:35.473
You are spoiled.

06:35.536 --> 06:37.303
- Spoiled?
- Yep.

06:37.305 --> 06:38.671
- Spoiled?
- Mm-hmm.

06:38.673 --> 06:40.439
Or is it I didn't have
a strong father figure

06:40.441 --> 06:41.574
to teach me how to do things?

06:41.576 --> 06:43.108
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:43.110 --> 06:44.543
it is my first weekend in New York,

06:44.545 --> 06:46.211
and I have a lot of sight-seeing to do.

06:46.213 --> 06:48.147
The fountain where
Carrie confronted Big,

06:48.149 --> 06:49.715
the church where Aidan
confronted Carrie,

06:49.717 --> 06:51.850
and the exterior for Samantha Jones' PR.

06:51.852 --> 06:53.586
You're not going anywhere, okay?

06:53.588 --> 06:55.254
First of all, you gotta clean
all this stuff up.

06:55.256 --> 06:57.056
Secondly, I'm gonna be
at the gym, busy, all day.

06:57.058 --> 06:58.490
Ooh, with that murder?

06:58.492 --> 07:00.492
I mean, obviously,
I don't want to interfere

07:00.494 --> 07:01.994
with an ongoing murder investigation.

07:01.996 --> 07:03.295
- Exactly.
- But I'm tired of being

07:03.297 --> 07:04.463
cooped up in here like Belle,

07:04.465 --> 07:06.432
or "Tangled," or "Sleeping Beauty."

07:06.434 --> 07:09.201
Damn, Disney, you lock up
more women than the Taliban.

07:09.203 --> 07:10.502
Yeah, so, you know, obviously

07:10.504 --> 07:11.904
I'd want you to come down to the gym,

07:11.906 --> 07:13.606
but justice must be served.

07:13.608 --> 07:15.774
So just, uh, stay put.

07:19.180 --> 07:20.779
Hello?

07:20.781 --> 07:22.147
<i>Hey, Priya, it's the man responsible</i>

07:22.149 --> 07:23.682
<i>for your teenage sexual awakening.</i>

07:23.684 --> 07:25.751
Ryan Phillippe?
How did you get my number?

07:25.753 --> 07:27.586
- No, it's Vince.
- Oh.

07:27.588 --> 07:30.556
But we got a problem.
Your son's kind of a slob.

07:30.558 --> 07:33.158
And he's trying to convince me
that you were cool with that?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.660
Oh, yeah, that's totally true.

07:34.662 --> 07:35.794
What? You tolerate that?

07:35.796 --> 07:37.329
You're like the biggest nag.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.664
<i>You were always like,
"Vince, have ambition.</i>

07:38.666 --> 07:39.765
Vince, wear a condom."

07:39.767 --> 07:40.733
I tried disciplining him,

07:40.735 --> 07:41.734
but it's just too hard.

07:41.736 --> 07:43.035
<i>After spending all day</i>

07:43.037 --> 07:44.670
putting catheters in elderly people,

07:44.672 --> 07:46.171
I didn't want to come home
and yell at him

07:46.173 --> 07:47.539
for some small thing,
like he left the gas on

07:47.541 --> 07:49.608
and the cat passed out.

07:49.610 --> 07:51.644
Okay, that's appalling,
and if I could just

07:51.646 --> 07:55.347
offer some gentle criticism
of your parenting style...

07:58.619 --> 08:01.086
I just signed up my eighth person.

08:01.088 --> 08:02.588
Good job.

08:02.590 --> 08:03.889
Wait, are you guys just sitting here

08:03.891 --> 08:05.057
eating all the promotional taffy?

08:05.059 --> 08:06.592
Well, what's the point?

08:06.594 --> 08:09.161
I intimidate people with
my unobtainable physique.

08:09.163 --> 08:10.129
They look at me and they're like,

08:10.131 --> 08:11.363
"I'll never have that.

08:11.365 --> 08:12.631
Might as well kill myself."

08:12.633 --> 08:14.033
And as an African-American man,

08:14.035 --> 08:15.100
I can't just run up to people

08:15.102 --> 08:16.402
on the street, you know?

08:16.404 --> 08:18.137
Check your privilege, Billy Eichner.

08:18.139 --> 08:20.506
He's not wrong. I love you Shabaz,

08:20.508 --> 08:21.940
but you got a real

08:21.942 --> 08:24.977
"See Something, Say Something" look.

08:42.163 --> 08:43.361
Hello, little mouse.

08:43.364 --> 08:45.464
You're just like me, all alone,

08:45.466 --> 08:47.299
trying to find some companionship.

08:47.301 --> 08:50.102
Whoa, I'm talking to a rodent.

08:50.104 --> 08:51.837
I gotta get out of here.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.511
Britney! It's Britney, right?

08:59.513 --> 09:01.980
Isn't New York spectacular?

09:01.982 --> 09:03.816
Even this cheap, poor part.

09:03.818 --> 09:06.852
I don't know you, little street urchin.

09:06.854 --> 09:08.821
- I don't know him.
- Oh, it's me, Michael.

09:08.823 --> 09:11.256
- We've definitely met.
- I'll take care of this.

09:11.258 --> 09:12.991
Hey, kid, we don't want to send your

09:12.993 --> 09:14.159
marching band to Disney World.

09:14.161 --> 09:15.627
Unless you want to, I don't know,

09:15.629 --> 09:17.663
do a cartwheel,
I'll throw you a quarter.

09:17.665 --> 09:19.164
No, I'm Vince Cook's son.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.632
You know, the tall,
forgettable white man

09:20.634 --> 09:22.868
with the tiny head,
obsessed with cleanliness?

09:22.870 --> 09:24.203
No.

09:24.205 --> 09:27.973
So it turns out that Vince has a kid.

09:27.975 --> 09:31.076
And you know it's his because
they have the same weird nose.

09:31.078 --> 09:32.611
I know. Don't look at it.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.779
I'm saving up to get a nose job

09:33.781 --> 09:34.947
on my 16th birthday.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.682
I'm making it bigger, like

09:36.684 --> 09:38.217
Blake Lively's original nose.

09:38.219 --> 09:41.253
That can't be Vince's kid.
He's, uh, how do you say,

09:41.255 --> 09:43.255
uh, too spicy looking.

09:43.257 --> 09:45.124
I can't keep this a secret any longer.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.925
I had a nephew with an Indian woman!

09:46.927 --> 09:49.762
You know what, I have
never felt so betrayed.

09:49.764 --> 09:51.196
Not even when my own teammates

09:51.198 --> 09:53.766
turned me in for doping
at the 2004 Olympics.

09:53.768 --> 09:55.901
How else are you supposed
to throw a hammer?

09:55.903 --> 09:58.036
- It's heavy!
- How do you think I feel?

09:58.038 --> 10:01.140
I just found out my dead
best friend has a grandson?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.441
How do I break that to him

10:02.443 --> 10:04.309
on my monthly visits to his tombstone?

10:04.311 --> 10:06.845
Uh, "Jimmy, you have a grandson.

10:06.847 --> 10:09.748
- Congrats"?
- That's pretty good, Shabaz.

10:09.750 --> 10:10.890
Email that to me.

10:10.915 --> 10:12.951
Why would he lie about having a son?

10:12.953 --> 10:14.319
I tell you guys everything.

10:14.321 --> 10:16.889
For instance, this entire outfit

10:16.891 --> 10:19.324
is from the lost and found.

10:19.326 --> 10:20.759
You think I know the Changs?

10:20.761 --> 10:22.461
Wait, so you guys
aren't mad about Michael?

10:22.463 --> 10:24.163
You're just mad about the lying?

10:24.165 --> 10:25.998
Yeah, 'cause we're family!

10:26.000 --> 10:28.267
And families don't keep secrets!

10:28.269 --> 10:29.701
Except for in movies,

10:29.703 --> 10:30.702
documentaries,

10:30.704 --> 10:31.670
Catholic countries,

10:31.672 --> 10:34.106
sad plays, and podcasts!

10:34.108 --> 10:36.108
Well, in that case,

10:36.110 --> 10:38.310
you should also know
that Vince sold the gym

10:38.312 --> 10:40.179
and if we don't raise $5,000 by Monday,

10:40.181 --> 10:42.815
we're all out of jobs. Ha. Whoo!

10:42.817 --> 10:45.150
What a relief.
Doesn't everyone feel better?

10:45.152 --> 10:46.852
- No! He sold the gym?
- Are you kidding me?

10:48.322 --> 10:49.988
Hey, hey! Guys, guys!

10:49.990 --> 10:54.193
Why isn't there a single
trainer out on the floor?

10:54.195 --> 10:56.628
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, they know about me.

10:56.630 --> 10:57.830
And they're obsessed with me.

10:57.832 --> 10:59.464
But you, you're done for.

10:59.466 --> 11:01.200
- Okay...
- You sold the gym?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.601
I need this job!

11:02.603 --> 11:04.536
I'm currently being sued
by Andrew Lloyd Webber

11:04.538 --> 11:05.871
for copyright infringement!

11:05.873 --> 11:07.806
And what am I supposed to do, huh?

11:07.808 --> 11:09.808
I'm gonna have to sell my houseboat,

11:09.810 --> 11:11.410
- which I can't even find.
- Well...

11:11.412 --> 11:12.978
I wanted to tell you from the beginning,

11:12.980 --> 11:15.247
but Vince said, "No one
will ever believe you

11:15.249 --> 11:16.582
because you're Indian."

11:16.584 --> 11:18.984
- No!
- That sounds exactly like him!

11:18.986 --> 11:20.319
N-no, no, never... never said that.

11:20.321 --> 11:22.120
That's it! I quit!

11:22.122 --> 11:23.422
I quit!

11:23.424 --> 11:25.057
And I'm gonna go find another job

11:25.059 --> 11:27.826
where they respect me,
or at least pay me really good.

11:27.828 --> 11:29.294
And then I won't care,

11:29.296 --> 11:31.363
'cause I'm gonna be
knee deep in milk shakes!

11:31.365 --> 11:33.765
Your father'd be real
proud of you, Vincent.

11:33.767 --> 11:35.601
Real proud.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.939
- Well...
- Sit down.

11:42.176 --> 11:45.110
Oh, man. Today was rough.

11:45.112 --> 11:47.913
But it kind of brought us

11:47.915 --> 11:50.315
closer together as a family.

11:50.317 --> 11:51.950
Really?

11:51.952 --> 11:53.785
Because I'm still pretty pissed at you

11:53.787 --> 11:55.587
for destroying our business.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.989
Me? You're the one who had

11:56.991 --> 11:59.024
a weird midlife crisis and sold the gym.

11:59.026 --> 12:00.392
Okay, you know what? I'm sorry.

12:00.394 --> 12:01.827
I didn't think it was too much to ask

12:01.829 --> 12:03.662
for you to keep my secret
considering I provide you

12:03.664 --> 12:05.831
with both housing and employment.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.733
Ow! You kneed me in the balls.

12:07.735 --> 12:09.201
I didn't do it on purpose.

12:09.203 --> 12:10.869
Anywhere my knee goes,
your crotch is there.

12:10.871 --> 12:12.838
That's because I'm sharing
a bed with my adult brother!

12:12.840 --> 12:14.439
We're like the grandparents
in "Willy Wonka"!

12:14.441 --> 12:15.874
Meanwhile, my tiny son

12:15.876 --> 12:17.976
has a California king all to himself!

12:17.978 --> 12:20.612
Yeah, and why shouldn't he?
He grew up without a dad!

12:20.614 --> 12:21.947
- Oh, my God.
- Which reminds me,

12:21.949 --> 12:23.015
Michael asked if he could have

12:23.017 --> 12:24.349
$200 a week in allowance.

12:24.351 --> 12:26.118
- Oh-ho-ho! That's rich.
- I said yes.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.619
- You what?
- Ow, my balls!

12:27.621 --> 12:29.254
Hey, we're not gonna be able
to give him any allowance

12:29.256 --> 12:31.456
because come Monday,
we're not gonna have jobs.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.358
Which is your fault!

12:33.360 --> 12:35.894
If you think I'm such
a bad influence on Michael,

12:35.896 --> 12:38.096
- maybe I should just leave.
- Maybe you should!

12:38.098 --> 12:41.099
- Everyone else has!
- Great!

12:41.101 --> 12:43.201
Have fun kneeing yourself
in the balls tonight

12:43.203 --> 12:46.204
- and every night forever!
- I will.

12:49.024 --> 12:50.691
Wait, so you just let Matthew move out?

12:50.750 --> 12:51.898
- Yep.
- Are you insane?

12:51.930 --> 12:55.085
Who's gonna clean and shop
and cook my breakfast?

12:55.148 --> 12:56.714
What is this, even?

12:56.716 --> 12:58.382
It's a block of cream cheese
with some raisins on it.

12:58.384 --> 13:00.551
Just think of it like
a cinnamon-raisin bagel,

13:00.553 --> 13:01.919
without the middle man.

13:01.921 --> 13:03.287
<i>Game on, MVPs.</i>

13:03.289 --> 13:04.722
<i>Matthew, Vin-kent,</i>

13:04.724 --> 13:06.457
<i>- time to play!</i>
- Hey, look.

13:06.459 --> 13:07.792
This is gonna be awesome.

13:07.794 --> 13:09.327
We're gonna get to know each other.

13:09.329 --> 13:10.962
For instance, you can ask me questions

13:10.964 --> 13:13.397
about my sick baseball career,
the hot chicks I dated.

13:13.399 --> 13:16.400
I mean, I... I do have a question.

13:16.402 --> 13:20.404
Why didn't you want anyone
at the gym to know about me?

13:20.406 --> 13:21.739
Are you sure you don't want

13:21.741 --> 13:24.909
just one hot chick story first?

13:24.911 --> 13:26.310
No? Okay, okay, all right.

13:26.312 --> 13:28.179
Look, um...

13:28.181 --> 13:30.414
Honestly, I don't know.

13:30.416 --> 13:32.083
You know, just some things
are personal, right?

13:32.085 --> 13:33.918
And I just don't want to broadcast them

13:33.920 --> 13:36.287
to everyone, like...
like I'm afraid of heights,

13:36.289 --> 13:39.457
or I've got a Pearl Jam
stickman tattoo on my leg, so...

13:39.459 --> 13:41.626
Oh, so by "personal,"
you mean "embarrassing"?

13:41.628 --> 13:43.094
You're embarrassed of me,

13:43.096 --> 13:44.695
which Matthew never was.

13:44.697 --> 13:46.364
You know what? You're right.
This was a great talk.

13:46.366 --> 13:48.166
Michael, that...

14:41.321 --> 14:43.154
Jeez, Ruby, you scared me.

14:43.156 --> 14:45.056
Then you will be terrified

14:45.058 --> 14:46.524
to know that Fitness Fanatics

14:46.526 --> 14:47.992
tried to poach me today.

14:47.994 --> 14:49.493
They were blown away

14:49.495 --> 14:50.895
by my professionalism.

14:50.897 --> 14:52.096
Hmm.

14:52.098 --> 14:53.931
Professionalism, that's nice.

14:53.933 --> 14:56.500
I trained your afternoon clients today,

14:56.502 --> 14:58.269
and they told me

14:58.271 --> 14:59.704
that you spend most of their sessions

14:59.706 --> 15:01.172
grinding up on the heavy bag.

15:01.174 --> 15:03.007
Sorry for being hilarious.

15:03.009 --> 15:05.276
But Fitness Fanatics,
they get that about me.

15:05.278 --> 15:06.577
- They offered me money...
- Hmm.

15:06.579 --> 15:08.179
Benefits, friends with benefits,

15:08.181 --> 15:10.748
but I'm gonna say no, and you know why?

15:10.750 --> 15:12.283
Because you're making all this up?

15:12.285 --> 15:13.417
No.

15:13.419 --> 15:16.254
Because I believe in Champions.

15:16.256 --> 15:18.022
Everyone who works here does.

15:18.024 --> 15:20.224
Why? This place is falling apart.

15:20.226 --> 15:21.626
I just stepped on a nail.

15:21.628 --> 15:23.628
We get our water delivered
from Flint, Michigan.

15:23.630 --> 15:25.696
It's not about the gym, Vince.

15:25.698 --> 15:28.065
It's about the people who work here,

15:28.067 --> 15:29.367
except you.

15:29.369 --> 15:31.369
You're so damn secretive all the time.

15:31.371 --> 15:32.937
You have a son, you sold the gym.

15:32.939 --> 15:34.572
Is that even your real hair color?

15:34.574 --> 15:36.040
Yeah, yeah, I dye my hair,

15:36.042 --> 15:37.775
and out of all the colors in the world,

15:37.777 --> 15:39.443
I went with grocery-bag brown.

15:39.445 --> 15:41.812
Your brother is crashing on my futon,

15:41.814 --> 15:45.549
boring all of my dates
with stories about you.

15:45.551 --> 15:48.085
Cara Delevinge was like, "Who Vince?"

15:50.790 --> 15:53.291
Okay, I don't think I've...

15:53.293 --> 15:56.661
ever said these words out loud,

15:56.663 --> 15:58.562
but, Ruby, I think you're right.

15:58.564 --> 15:59.597
And Matthew's right,

15:59.599 --> 16:00.831
and Michael's right.

16:00.833 --> 16:03.000
Damn it, am I wrong about everything?

16:03.002 --> 16:05.136
Is "Muhammad Christ Superstar"
going to be good?

16:06.639 --> 16:08.439
All right, come on,
let's go to your place.

16:08.441 --> 16:10.241
Ah, look.

16:10.243 --> 16:11.742
I am flattered,

16:11.744 --> 16:13.678
and, yes, you look like a lesbian,

16:13.680 --> 16:15.246
but not the kind I like.

16:15.248 --> 16:17.915
You're like the tall,
skinny social worker type

16:17.917 --> 16:19.417
with cold hands.

16:19.419 --> 16:20.818
I meant to get Matthew.

16:20.820 --> 16:22.820
Mm. Good save.

16:22.822 --> 16:25.823
I see you lusting after my perm.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.359
So I guess we're not
taking our shoes off?

16:30.438 --> 16:32.415
- I'll go get your brother.
- Brother?

16:32.468 --> 16:34.073
I have no brother.

16:34.156 --> 16:36.362
You're just the father of my nephew,

16:36.394 --> 16:38.060
the son of my mother,

16:38.093 --> 16:39.612
my male sister.

16:39.660 --> 16:41.112
I get it. I get it, all right?

16:41.137 --> 16:42.112
I was wrong to think

16:42.137 --> 16:43.456
I could take care
of Michael without you.

16:43.495 --> 16:44.527
Ruby and I have fallen

16:44.529 --> 16:45.995
into a pretty good rhythm here.

16:45.997 --> 16:47.230
She might be my new brother.

16:47.232 --> 16:48.865
Here's all your stuff.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.366
And you know what?

16:50.368 --> 16:51.968
I'm keeping your deodorant for rent.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.571
Ruby, can I have
a private conversation, please?

16:54.573 --> 16:56.673
Hey, this is a common area!

16:56.675 --> 16:57.974
God!

16:57.976 --> 17:01.044
I'm gonna go hit the tub!

17:01.046 --> 17:03.413
Well, if I come back,

17:03.415 --> 17:04.681
what's in it for me?

17:04.683 --> 17:06.516
I don't know, to be honest.

17:06.518 --> 17:09.152
What I do know is that Michael
needs you back at home.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.521
Man, I need you back at home.

17:11.522 --> 17:13.589
You've given me a lot to think about.

17:13.592 --> 17:16.226
I'm gonna take a day,
and I'm gonna weigh my options.

17:16.228 --> 17:18.694
You must leave!

17:18.696 --> 17:20.430
Okay, let's try and make this work.

17:20.432 --> 17:22.031
Cool, thank you, man.

17:23.401 --> 17:25.167
Hey, guys, thanks for coming in.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.669
Your email said you had our paychecks.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.070
Right, yeah, well, uh...

17:28.073 --> 17:29.739
the truth is, I brought you guys in here

17:29.741 --> 17:31.941
for something better than paychecks.

17:31.943 --> 17:33.743
- Mm.
- Apologies!

17:35.013 --> 17:36.746
Guys, look, none of my dreams

17:36.748 --> 17:38.248
have ever really come true,

17:38.250 --> 17:40.416
and working at my dad's gym just

17:40.418 --> 17:42.252
made me feel like a failure.

17:42.254 --> 17:44.120
So that's why I sold it.

17:44.122 --> 17:46.389
And I kept you guys in the dark
because I figured

17:46.391 --> 17:48.191
I could handle it on my own,

17:48.193 --> 17:49.626
but now I know that I can't.

17:49.628 --> 17:51.761
Ah, Vince, Vincent, come on,

17:51.763 --> 17:54.030
we've all done stuff we're not proud of.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.598
I once lied at a restaurant

17:55.600 --> 17:58.201
and said it was my birthday
just to get a free cupcake.

17:58.203 --> 17:59.869
And I pushed Sterling K. Brown

17:59.871 --> 18:02.605
down a flight of stairs so
I could get the role in "OJ."

18:02.607 --> 18:04.240
And who was at the bottom?

18:04.242 --> 18:06.042
Ryan freakin' Murphy.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.711
Okay, so I guess
what I did was somewhere

18:08.713 --> 18:10.446
in the middle of those two things,

18:10.448 --> 18:11.948
but, uh...

18:11.950 --> 18:15.051
my biggest apology is to
the person I hurt the most.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.719
Thank you.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.122
But if you're trying to get out
of hosting my butt-vodka party,

18:19.124 --> 18:20.623
you are sorely mistaken.

18:20.625 --> 18:23.126
Anthony Scaramucci just RSVP'd.

18:23.128 --> 18:24.727
Britney...

18:24.729 --> 18:25.795
not you.

18:25.797 --> 18:27.964
Michael.

18:27.966 --> 18:29.799
Look, I realized that

18:29.801 --> 18:31.501
not telling you guys about Michael

18:31.503 --> 18:35.004
probably made it seem like
I was embarrassed of him.

18:35.006 --> 18:36.339
But that's not true.

18:36.341 --> 18:37.807
I'm embarrassed of myself

18:37.809 --> 18:40.009
and of what you guys
probably thought about me

18:40.011 --> 18:43.079
not taking care of my only son.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.314
I'm sorry.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.820
To... I was gonna... Okay.

18:50.822 --> 18:52.822
- Okay...
- Yeah, sorry it's not better.

18:52.824 --> 18:55.358
- It just felt really weird.
- Fathers and sons reuniting,

18:55.360 --> 18:57.493
uncles hovering nearby,

18:57.495 --> 18:59.095
nothing could ever ruin this moment.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.731
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Unbelievable!

19:04.836 --> 19:06.836
- No, no one help me.
- Whoa.

19:06.838 --> 19:08.771
- Ooh.
- Yeah, okay. Heh.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.340
- I got it.
- You got it? Okay.

19:10.342 --> 19:11.708
Yes. I got it.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.009
- Oh!
- Okay, jeez!

19:13.011 --> 19:14.544
All right, here, here,
just take my hand.

19:14.546 --> 19:16.145
What do you do
for an encore, sweetheart?

19:16.147 --> 19:17.680
Dana, you could've just
told us from over there.

19:17.682 --> 19:20.216
You're wasting everyone's time.

19:20.218 --> 19:22.785
You still need $5,000
by the end of tomorrow,

19:22.787 --> 19:24.387
otherwise Vince is going
to lose the gym.

19:24.389 --> 19:25.855
Wait, wait, wait.

19:25.857 --> 19:27.557
What about our membership drive?

19:27.559 --> 19:29.359
We were out there forever.

19:29.361 --> 19:30.693
My nose got sunburnt.

19:30.695 --> 19:33.630
You made $200. $50, if you count

19:33.632 --> 19:35.398
all of the promotional
taffy that you ate.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.200
Hey, other people ate it too.

19:37.202 --> 19:38.701
I wasn't the only one, so don't...

19:38.703 --> 19:39.702
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

19:39.704 --> 19:41.070
It's okay, guys, relax.

19:41.072 --> 19:44.007
I think I know another way
to get the money.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.380
Please take care of him.

19:50.382 --> 19:51.848
And unplug him one night a week,

19:51.850 --> 19:53.549
just to let the processor cool.

19:53.551 --> 19:55.919
Oh, well, we're gonna
destroy it on camera

19:55.921 --> 19:58.354
for our YouTube channel, BlammoBoys.

19:58.356 --> 20:00.056
Yeah, we bring Christ to people

20:00.058 --> 20:01.090
through exploding stuff.

20:01.092 --> 20:02.191
- You what?
- Hey.

20:02.193 --> 20:03.493
Vince, did you hear that?

20:03.495 --> 20:05.194
It's okay. Just get out of here.

20:05.196 --> 20:06.729
<i>Matthew, Vin-kent,</i>

20:06.731 --> 20:08.197
<i>let's play a game...</i>

20:08.199 --> 20:10.233
So what are we gonna do with the space?

20:12.938 --> 20:15.004
Bam! Pretty awesome, huh?

20:15.006 --> 20:18.374
- Your own room.
- Oh, my God!

20:19.911 --> 20:22.745
This has some serious potential.

20:22.747 --> 20:25.548
I'm picturing a tasteful candelabra,

20:25.550 --> 20:27.250
black, velvet curtains.

20:27.252 --> 20:28.851
You know, dark elegance.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.620
Cool. Here's all your mess.

20:30.622 --> 20:33.256
And if any of it makes
its way outside of the room,

20:33.258 --> 20:34.724
goes in the garbage.

20:34.726 --> 20:36.259
Now, please go help
your uncle make dinner.

20:36.261 --> 20:37.593
I have the funniest apron.

20:37.595 --> 20:39.095
It says, "I like cooking with wine.

20:39.097 --> 20:41.264
Sometimes I even add it to the food."

20:42.600 --> 20:44.100
Me? Help with dinner?

20:44.102 --> 20:46.102
I've never done that before.

20:46.104 --> 20:48.071
But you know who would do
a really great job

20:48.073 --> 20:51.140
- helping with dinner?
- Oh, nice try, Tom Sawyer.

20:51.142 --> 20:52.375
Look, I worked all day,

20:52.377 --> 20:53.776
saved my gym, built you this room.

20:53.778 --> 20:55.278
I'm father of the year.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.413
Now I'm gonna go fall asleep
watching "SportsCenter,"

20:57.415 --> 21:00.283
so please, go help
your uncle make dinner.
