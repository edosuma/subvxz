12:22.776 --> 12:24.776
I need you to trust me
that I know what I'm doing.

12:24.778 --> 12:25.944
Can you do that?

12:27.414 --> 12:28.646
[sighs] Sure.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.116
[footsteps depart]

12:32.753 --> 12:34.385
I actually agree with her.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.554
It doesn't make sense
to keep your most powerful meta

12:36.556 --> 12:38.757
-off the front line, unless--
-Unless what?

12:38.759 --> 12:40.925
Unless you don't think you can
beat Gravedigger, either.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.932
Anissa and I have
some recruiting to do.
I'll see you later.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.367
-Be safe, Jeff.
-Yeah.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.037
You wouldn't lie to me now,
would you?

12:53.039 --> 12:54.439
[woman] Never.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.441
He said he was a...

12:56.443 --> 12:57.575
doctor of some kind.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.611
This means a lot to me,
you know that?

13:00.747 --> 13:01.813
Uh-uh.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.650
[chuckles]

13:05.652 --> 13:09.154
Make sure she get back
to the O without Destiny
or Lady Eve knowing.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.555
-I got you.
-All right.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.023
Come on.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.427
Things must be pretty bad

13:16.429 --> 13:18.730
for y'all to come
all the way down here
to talk to us lower folks.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.233
So what can I do for you?

13:22.235 --> 13:24.969
There's a war
coming to Freeland.
We could use your troops.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.905
We want you to join a fight
against the Markovians.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.473
[scoffs]

13:28.475 --> 13:29.474
Y'all want us to fight

13:29.476 --> 13:30.809
for your cause?

13:30.811 --> 13:32.443
Come on, Lala, we want you
to fight for Freeland.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.246
Nah. I'm good.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.815
I'm gonna leave
that superhero stuff

13:36.817 --> 13:38.683
to y'all jokers in costumes.

13:38.685 --> 13:42.320
I'm gonna focus
on making sure that the folks
in Freeland are eating.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.290
There won't be nothing to eat
if Freeland is destroyed.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.992
I told you this was gonna be
a waste of time.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.863
Lala don't give a damn
about nobody but Lala.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.464
You better listen
to your sidekick.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.799
-Sweetheart's sharp.
-Don't do it.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.801
[Thunder] You lucky
I got bigger things

13:56.803 --> 13:58.503
to take care of
because if I didn't,

13:58.505 --> 14:00.705
I'd take out
you and your whole crew
with my bare hands.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.073
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh!

14:03.143 --> 14:04.609
Hold on, now.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.812
-She got a temper on her,
don't she?
-Yeah, she do.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.181
Them powers got you
all swoled up.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.184
Just because you're a meta
don't mean you can't get got.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.721
If I get got,

14:17.390 --> 14:18.857
it ain't gonna be by you.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.659
-Okay, hold on a minute.
-Now, you wait a minute.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.294
Y'all think y'all can
just come up in here

14:23.296 --> 14:26.297
and body us into doing whatever
the hell y'all want us to do?

14:26.299 --> 14:28.533
-That's what they thought,
didn't they?
-Couldn't have been.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.869
'Cause these boys raring to
blow they meta heads clean off.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.837
I promise y'all want
none of this smoke.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.340
All right, that's it.
That's enough.
We ain't got time for this.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.175
You're a businessman.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.411
The government
will turn Freeland
into a radioactive crater.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.046
Now, how you gonna
do business then?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.448
Ooh, that's a nice hustle.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.317
But y'all two
can take it to go.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.556
So, it's like that.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.058
Oh, yeah. It's like that.

15:05.005 --> 15:05.904
Oh, Brandon.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.439
How did you get past security?

15:09.743 --> 15:12.110
Wasn't hard.

15:12.112 --> 15:15.747
You're gonna tell me everything
I want to know about my family.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.749
Or you'll never see
your family again.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.658
So, you're back from the dead.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.593
Indeed.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.896
At least now we know
where Lazarus has been.

15:31.898 --> 15:35.900
You are<i> persona non grata.</i>
You've been excommunicated.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.502
I'm aware.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.806
-I want back in.
-I want world peace.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.943
But you can't always
get what you want.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.911
Sure you can.

15:46.913 --> 15:49.647
I know that war
is coming to Freeland.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.783
So does everybody else
with a radio. So what?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.584
I also know some other things.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.587
I'm sure you know
all kinds of little tidbits.

15:56.589 --> 16:02.593
Drugging ASA agents who came
to visit your establishment

16:02.595 --> 16:07.265
must have given you
an endless source of chit-chat.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.434
Facts.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.804
One of the tidbits
I learned is that

16:12.806 --> 16:17.642
you and the ASA have decided
to cut and run.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.644
If that were true, I wouldn't
still be in Freeland.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.081
[scoffs] You would
if there were something
here you still wanted.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.315
Like what?

16:26.019 --> 16:28.753
Before we talk
about what you want...

16:31.257 --> 16:33.658
-let's talk about what I want.
-Which is?

16:33.660 --> 16:38.196
My seat back at the table
with the rest of
the Shadow Board.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.964
That's a big ask.

16:39.966 --> 16:43.901
I doubt if you have
anything valuable enough
to exchange for that.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.538
If you die in this war,

16:47.540 --> 16:50.141
I'll use Lazarus
to bring you back to life.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.776
I have contingencies in place,

16:51.778 --> 16:56.681
and I've made peace
with my own mortality
a long time ago.

16:56.683 --> 17:01.019
For a moment, I thought
you were gonna offer me
something more tangible.

17:01.021 --> 17:04.288
-Like the location
of the briefcase.
-Yes.

17:06.292 --> 17:10.628
If I give you the location
of the briefcase,

17:10.630 --> 17:17.301
I want my seat back
on the Shadow Board
and my cartel back in the game.

17:17.303 --> 17:21.139
You were a competent earner
for our clandestine activities.

17:22.909 --> 17:27.211
Once I verify and acquire
the briefcase,

17:28.548 --> 17:30.481
I'll put you back in business.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.795
[machine beeps]

17:49.035 --> 17:50.234
[whirring]

17:50.236 --> 17:51.636
[typing]

17:59.612 --> 18:01.112
[R&B music playing]

18:01.114 --> 18:02.480
How you feeling, babe?

18:03.116 --> 18:06.117
Tired. Sore.

18:06.119 --> 18:09.053
Fighting bad guys
is a lot of work.
I don't know how you do it.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.721
I just focus on the results.

18:10.723 --> 18:14.258
Being able to
rescue Terry, Anaya,
and the rest of the Perdi.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.726
That's what makes it
worth it for me.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.462
Here, take this. It'll help.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.330
Thanks.

18:22.602 --> 18:26.237
And for the past few months,
my body's been acting strange.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.973
-Like, I don't even know
my own strength.
-Really?

18:28.975 --> 18:31.175
Yeah. Watch this.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.248
[grunts]

18:37.250 --> 18:38.583
Whoa, whoa. Babe, babe, wait.

18:38.585 --> 18:39.784
Whoa, whoa. Watch the candles.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.786
No, no, no. I got it.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.788
[chuckles] See, you're
breaking everything.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.225
[grunts]

18:47.227 --> 18:50.061
-Careful.
-I couldn't do this
two months ago.

18:50.964 --> 18:51.863
Whew.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.067
You know,
all that shapeshifting

18:56.069 --> 18:58.569
has to put a lot of strain
on your muscles.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.339
And given your unique
morphology, babe,

19:01.341 --> 19:04.075
my best guess is
it's your body
reinforcing itself.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.811
Reinforcing itself?
What does that mean?

19:06.813 --> 19:10.481
-I think you're evolving.
-Evolving into what?

19:10.483 --> 19:14.218
That, I don't know,
but your body is
definitely changing.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.755
Hey.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.557
[sighs softly]

19:21.528 --> 19:23.194
What?

19:23.196 --> 19:24.695
I know you got a lot
going on right now,

19:24.697 --> 19:26.230
but there's something
I need to tell you.

19:28.001 --> 19:28.900
Okay.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.605
-I'm just gonna say it.
-Say what?

19:34.607 --> 19:37.742
The DNA sample
I took from Gravedigger
matches your DNA.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.547
-What?
-When I examined
his chromosomes,

19:42.549 --> 19:44.882
I discovered that you
and Gravedigger were related.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.517
No. No, that's not possible.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.320
I redid the test five times.
It's a match.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.289
Jeff, it makes sense.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.325
The reason you, and Anissa
and Jennifer are the only
stable metas in Freeland

19:54.327 --> 19:58.262
is because you're related
to the original meta,
Gravedigger.

20:02.368 --> 20:06.938
I... I had a great-uncle
that everyone said
died during World War II.

20:08.541 --> 20:12.877
But now I think about it,
no one actually said he died.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.880
They said he never came back.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.618
Gravedigger's your great-uncle.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.997
I'm worried about
what might happen tomorrow.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.967
Yeah, me, too.

20:37.503 --> 20:39.737
But you know what?

20:39.739 --> 20:42.139
Being here with you
has me all blissed out.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.078
It's like when I'm with you,
all bad things go away.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.983
I could do this forever.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.087
Me, too.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.590
I mean it.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.126
I could really
see myself doing this
for the rest of my life.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.161
Mmm. I know.

21:08.268 --> 21:11.702
Wait a minute,
what are you saying?

21:11.704 --> 21:13.004
What do you think I'm saying?

21:14.307 --> 21:16.307
[both chuckle]

21:21.281 --> 21:23.347
I still can't believe
this is happening.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.518
We're gonna be in a war,
tomorrow.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.789
Yeah, I know what you mean.
We could die.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.393
[sighs] Wow.

21:35.395 --> 21:38.863
I just got out of the pod.
There's still so much stuff
I need to do.

21:40.233 --> 21:41.699
Yeah, I've never
even kissed a girl.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.569
-Really?
-What?

21:45.571 --> 21:49.373
Did you just try to use
the fact that we might die
tomorrow to scam a kiss?

21:49.909 --> 21:52.076
Yes. Yes, I did.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.378
But it's true.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.181
I've never kissed a girl.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.382
Come on, you can't be
mad at that.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.321
It was worth a shot.

22:07.427 --> 22:08.693
Oh. Okay.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.494
Now you can die happy.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.931
-Wait, does that mean
you like me?
-That means I took pity on you.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.834
But does that count, though?

22:16.836 --> 22:19.337
-I mean, I wasn't ready--
-You're not getting
another kiss.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.771
-Am I interrupting something?
-No.

22:20.773 --> 22:21.739
Yes.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.044
-Did you find Brandon?
-Uh-uh.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.513
-Y'all seen my dad?
-Mmm, he went home.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.649
[sighs]
I still don't understand why
we have to be in the back.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.217
Why are you
so anxious to fight?

22:33.219 --> 22:34.385
Because she's mad aggressive.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.354
-No, I'm not.
-Yeah, you kinda are.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.556
Okay, whatever. Can I please
talk to you for a second?

22:38.558 --> 22:40.458
Yeah. Be right back.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.093
Excuse us.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.564
[quietly] Yo, don't you see
I'm trying to do something?

22:46.566 --> 22:48.532
-TC, that girl don't want you.
-Yes, she do.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.434
Can you use your powers
to find Gravedigger?

22:51.003 --> 22:53.070
[sighs] I think so.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.405
Okay, I need to know
when he's in Freeland.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.074
-Why?
-Don't ask me any questions.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.376
I just need to know, okay?

22:58.378 --> 23:00.745
-Can you help me or not?
-Yeah, I'll help you.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.046
[cell phone vibrates]

23:16.496 --> 23:19.597
[Painkiller]<i> Any time you got</i>
<i> something difficult done.</i>

23:19.599 --> 23:22.299
<i> Any time you really</i>
<i> had to dig deep.</i>

23:23.503 --> 23:25.136
Any time
it was life or death...

23:30.209 --> 23:32.176
That was me
that got you through it.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.180
That's not true.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.516
I did that on my own.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.418
You don't even believe that.

23:40.420 --> 23:44.321
See, deep down, you know that
I'm the rage you tapped into...

23:45.358 --> 23:47.358
to make you a track star.

23:47.360 --> 23:53.597
I'm the same rage
that helped you stay up
all night to get all those A's.

23:57.203 --> 24:01.272
I'm the rage that kept you
alive during those surgeries.

24:01.274 --> 24:04.809
Spinal replacement
and every last enhancement.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.878
That was me.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.015
Not you,

24:11.717 --> 24:12.683
me.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.852
You're not even real.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.290
[scoffs]

24:19.292 --> 24:22.193
Yeah, we'll see
just how real I am
once I kill the Pierce family.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.665
[breathes sharply]

24:28.568 --> 24:29.867
I won't let that happen.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.306
You don't have a choice.

[grunting]

25:09.842 --> 25:12.042
[bangs on door] No! No!

25:12.044 --> 25:14.211
I'll be sure to let the Pierces
know you said hello.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.081
[Khalil] Come here!

25:17.550 --> 25:19.917
No. No!

25:29.862 --> 25:30.928
Hey.

25:32.632 --> 25:33.898
Are you okay?

25:37.904 --> 25:38.802
I don't know.

25:41.140 --> 25:44.542
Anissa wanted us
to go over and have dinner
with her and Grace.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.412
Could be our last
family dinner together.

25:50.316 --> 25:54.418
We should invite Brandon,
and TC and Erica.
Those kids have nowhere to go.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.657
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.628
There's something else
I need to talk to you about.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.374
Is Tobias my cousin?

26:17.376 --> 26:18.342
[chuckles]

26:19.512 --> 26:22.813
No. Tobias is not your cousin.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.821
I know you have a code.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.326
It's one of the things
that I love about you.

26:37.730 --> 26:38.696
Uh-huh.

26:40.533 --> 26:43.500
Gravedigger is potentially
the most powerful meta
on the planet.

26:45.705 --> 26:46.937
He has the serum,

26:46.939 --> 26:49.773
which means he has access
to every meta power.

26:49.775 --> 26:50.975
Lynn, what are you saying?

26:52.945 --> 26:54.445
If Gravedigger is successful,

26:54.447 --> 26:56.547
thousands of people
could be killed.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.083
Including our daughters.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.117
[sighs]

27:01.220 --> 27:03.120
-You don't know that.
-Yes, Jeff...

27:04.824 --> 27:06.323
I do.

27:06.325 --> 27:08.959
You just told me you would
never ask me to kill.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.061
And I meant it.
I... I still mean it.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.031
But things have changed, Jeff.

27:15.568 --> 27:18.435
If it comes down
to Gravedigger or you,

27:18.437 --> 27:20.137
or our girls...

27:20.139 --> 27:23.974
No, you said you would always
protect our family.

27:26.345 --> 27:29.146
All I'm asking you to do
is protect our family.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.892
You should get changed.
Anissa's expecting us.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.617
-Hey!
-Hey.

28:06.619 --> 28:07.951
Hey!

28:09.021 --> 28:10.621
-Honey, good to see you.
-Okay.

28:10.623 --> 28:12.022
-[Lynn] Hey, Grace.
-[Jennifer]
It smells good in here.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.024
-What's up, Grace?
-Nice place.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.193
[Anissa] Welcome.
Thank you. Welcome.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.962
[laughs] Stop.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.130
[Jennifer]
I'm gonna tear it up.

28:21.801 --> 28:24.134
All right, get comfortable.
Grace is cooking dinner.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.203
You know, guys,
given the circumstances,

28:26.205 --> 28:28.739
I just figured
it be nice for us to have
a home-cooked meal.

28:28.741 --> 28:29.707
-Right?
-Yeah.

28:29.709 --> 28:30.908
You mean like the Last Supper?

28:30.910 --> 28:32.876
-Jennifer.
-It's the truth.

28:32.878 --> 28:35.045
No, Jennifer, it's not like
the Last Supper.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.648
It's actually quite opposite.

28:37.650 --> 28:39.917
So, Grace and I have something
we wanna tell you.

28:41.554 --> 28:42.753
[both] We're getting married!

28:44.256 --> 28:46.990
-Oh, my God! Congrats!
-[girls squeal]

28:46.992 --> 28:49.226
-Finally! Oh, my God.
-[Anissa] Thank you, sis.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.195
-[Jennifer] Congrats, y'all.
-Thank you.

28:51.197 --> 28:55.332
Okay, all right, so,
Uncle Gambi already agreed
to officiate the ceremony...

28:56.435 --> 28:58.435
and it's happening here,
tonight.

28:58.437 --> 28:59.470
[girls chuckle]

29:01.107 --> 29:03.140
-Sit down,
dinner's almost ready.
-[Jennifer] Whoo!

29:04.577 --> 29:06.577
[Anissa] Get ready to sit down.

29:06.579 --> 29:07.478
[Erica] All right.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.816
You know that's not necessary.

29:13.753 --> 29:14.818
Yes, it is.

to the earth, I see.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.205
That's how I like it.

29:35.207 --> 29:38.142
You know, you really
could have just called.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.678
Baby, you might not
have picked up.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.949
This way, I know I got
your full, undivided attention.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.986
You know I don't like to go
anywhere without my twins.

29:51.490 --> 29:52.389
Are you okay?

29:54.960 --> 29:56.059
Yes.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.700
[sighs]

30:05.171 --> 30:06.403
Has, uh...

30:07.306 --> 30:08.972
Lala been a gentleman?

Uh-uh.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.348
Except for the gun, yes.

30:18.350 --> 30:21.185
A little bird told me that
you know some information
that I need to know.

30:21.187 --> 30:24.855
And I thought
you were smarter than
to listen to little birdies.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.690
Depends on the bird.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.594
Word is...

30:30.596 --> 30:34.464
you know the identity of
the last man that saw Tobias
before he left Freeland.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.732
[Lady Eve] Mmm-mmm-mmm.

30:37.102 --> 30:39.803
And I thought
we were gonna be friends.

30:39.805 --> 30:42.506
We are friends.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.608
And if you tell me
what I need to know...

30:47.279 --> 30:48.712
we can keep it that way.

for a second?
-Yeah.

31:04.697 --> 31:07.998
I'm so happy
that you found someone
to marry, but... [sighs]

31:08.000 --> 31:09.633
I have to admit, I--

31:09.635 --> 31:11.468
It's happening fast, Mom.
I know.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.004
[sighs] I don't know
anything about Grace.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.073
All you need to know
is that I love her.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.308
Mom, look.

31:19.745 --> 31:22.079
We are about to go to war.

31:22.081 --> 31:24.248
None of us knows
how that's gonna turn out.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.150
But what I do know is that
if something bad happens

31:27.152 --> 31:31.021
and I don't marry her,
I'll regret it for
the rest of my life.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.856
Would you be doing this
if there wasn't a war?

31:32.858 --> 31:34.758
Yes, hands down.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.461
Maybe not as soon,
but yes, definitely.

31:38.264 --> 31:39.229
Okay.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.666
I get it.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.434
And I couldn't
be happier for you.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.436
Or Grace.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.207
Congratulations.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.009
-Thank you, Mom.
-I love you.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.847
Hey, congrats again.

31:56.849 --> 31:58.715
Thanks.

31:58.717 --> 32:01.885
It must be so nice to be
close to your sister
and your family.

32:01.887 --> 32:03.720
Yeah, it is.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.957
I mean, it's not always easy,
but I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.793
Anissa talks about you
all the time.

32:09.795 --> 32:12.863
I admire what you guys have.
I wish I had siblings.

32:12.865 --> 32:14.965
Well, hey. Now, you do.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.833
Yeah. I guess I do.

32:18.070 --> 32:18.969
Hey.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.238
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.474
I've never had any real family,

32:24.476 --> 32:29.479
so I'm excited and grateful
to be joining your family.

No, not yet. What are you
planning on doing?

to go through all this to get
the information you want.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.776
Maybe.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.145
This is the only way
I can make sure
if you're telling the truth.

38:26.505 --> 38:30.006
They've held us
in captivity for decades.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.909
They've stolen our lives.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.313

39:11.450 --> 39:13.950

39:20.392 --> 39:22.225
We got a bogie at nine o'clock.
What is that?

39:22.227 --> 39:24.627
-I'm checking now.
<i> -What is it, a missile?</i>

39:24.629 --> 39:25.695

Oh, my God, Jeff... that's Jen!

39:43.915 --> 39:46.249
I got you, baby girl.

No. No, I got nothing.

All right, I got a pulse.
I got a pulse.
