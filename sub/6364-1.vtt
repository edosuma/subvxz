00:02.269 --> 00:03.402
.

00:03.403 --> 00:04.536
- Who called internal affairs?

00:04.538 --> 00:06.705
- Voight's the best
there is to handle this.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.308
- You said this was gonna be
a partnership.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.710
A lot of different kinds
of partnerships.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.445
- What the hell
is going on around here?

00:13.447 --> 00:16.382
- Just let it go.
- [muffled screaming]

00:16.384 --> 00:18.550
- Jin, i need his wire
on his personal phone

00:18.552 --> 00:21.053
And inside his car.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.489
- You violated
my number one rule.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.057
- Who do you for?

00:25.059 --> 00:26.425
- You.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.627
- Sheldon jin.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.429
I believe he worked
in your unit.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.803
- Sergeant voight
is very familiar

00:37.805 --> 00:39.171
With the rules and guidelines

00:39.173 --> 00:40.706
Of the chicago police
department.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.274
And he was given
a direct order

00:42.276 --> 00:44.410
From street deputy horton
to answer each

00:44.412 --> 00:46.378
And every question
truthfully.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.447
- At this time i'd like to state
that sergeant voight is

00:48.449 --> 00:53.252
Only answering these questions
under duress.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.421
- You got something
you want to ask me?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.506
Ask it.

00:57.507 --> 00:59.590
- The last person we know
sheldon jin spoke to

00:59.593 --> 01:01.326
Was you.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.195
There was
an outgoing cell phone call

01:03.197 --> 01:05.564
From your personal cell
to jin's personal cell

01:05.566 --> 01:08.400
An hour before he was killed.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.668
Do you remember
making that call?

01:09.670 --> 01:10.803
- I do.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.705
- Sergeant voight...

01:12.706 --> 01:14.606
Were you in any way involved
or did you have any knowledge

01:14.608 --> 01:18.744
That would lead to an arrest
of the individual

01:18.746 --> 01:20.345
Responsible for
the murder of

01:20.347 --> 01:22.681
Chicago police officer
sheldon jin?

01:22.683 --> 01:25.417
- Absolutely not.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.521
Are we done?

01:34.128 --> 01:36.795
- For now.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.398
- Stay reachable, sergeant.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:48.676 --> 01:51.143
- Nadia's first day.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.679
- Can she even type?

01:53.681 --> 01:55.414
Did we look into that
at all?

01:55.416 --> 01:58.784
- Yeah, she can, smartass.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.352
Do not hit on her.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.454
- Nadia?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.789
What kind of a dog
do you think i am?

02:08.362 --> 02:10.562
- How'd it go?
- It went.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.730
They asked
some stupid questions.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.265
I left.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.399
- Boss, where they at
with jin's murder?

02:14.401 --> 02:17.136
- Nowhere.
Where's antonio?

02:17.138 --> 02:18.403
- He's meeting an informant.

02:18.405 --> 02:22.341
He's got a tip on some
armored van thing.

02:22.343 --> 02:25.244
- Sarge, why aren't we looking
into jin's murder on our own?

02:25.246 --> 02:28.147
- For the same reason
i told you last time you asked.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.315
They don't want us
anywhere near it

02:30.317 --> 02:31.483
Since we has in our unit,
okay?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.418
He was a police officer.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.387
Area central is all over it.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.523
- So they had no updates
this morning?

02:44.431 --> 02:46.465
- The update...

02:46.467 --> 02:50.302
The update is they're coming
after my badge!

02:50.304 --> 02:52.371
So when there is
another update

02:52.373 --> 02:56.175
I will convey it, okay?

02:56.177 --> 03:01.213
Until then,
just do your jobs.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.389
- Is it an inside job, or...

03:10.391 --> 03:13.492
- I already told you
what i know.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.826
- Who gave you this?

03:14.828 --> 03:16.762
- This guy i'm seeing.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.830
And don't ask me his name.
I'm not gonna tell you.

03:18.832 --> 03:22.267
He's not involved.
He just knows the guys who are.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.203
- This guy you seeing
the one who gave you the eye?

03:24.205 --> 03:26.371
- Yeah, i'm leaving his ass
as soon as i have enough money

03:26.373 --> 03:28.473
To get to kansas city.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.642
To my sister's place.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.545
- Well, i gotta be honest.
I'm a little suspect, jellybean.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.882
'cause this is way above
your normal level of info.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.618
- Have i ever
lied to you before?

03:45.492 --> 03:47.492
- She's never lied to me before.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.994
I've gotten 12 tips from her
in the past.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.429
All of them paid off.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.864
- Trade-safe, route 5, tomorrow.
That's it?

03:52.866 --> 03:54.766
- That's it.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.535
It won't be too hard to get
someone inside

03:56.537 --> 03:58.470
Because if this is legit,

03:58.472 --> 03:59.838
The armored van company
will back our play.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.242
- All right, set it up.

04:03.244 --> 04:06.345
- Yep.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.280
Is everything all right?

04:08.282 --> 04:10.349
- Yeah, i'm fine.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.853
- How much you make an hour?
- $12.50.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.355
- How long you been
with the company?

04:16.357 --> 04:17.456
- Six months.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.558
- What do you hate
about the job?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.360
- I love everything about it.
I really do.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.361
[laughs]

04:22.363 --> 04:24.863
- Hey, er.
How do i look?

04:24.865 --> 04:25.964
- Great.
- Great.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.567
I'm ready to go.
Where do you want me?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.469
- You know this is
the back entrance, right?

04:30.471 --> 04:31.870
- Oh.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.538
- Go around the front.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.741
Sergeant platt will
give you the paperwork to sign.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.542
- Cool.
Thanks again.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.511
- Yeah.
Okay, off you go.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.647
- Okay.
- [clears throat]

04:41.649 --> 04:44.616
- We'll be right behind you--
eyes and ears--the whole time.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.984
You got two distress signals.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.586
For visual, just run both hands
through your hair.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.921
For verbal, just say "popcorn."
- popcorn?

04:49.923 --> 04:51.990
- Either one of those or both,
and we're moving in.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.558
- All right, i got it.

04:53.560 --> 04:58.063
- Hey.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.798
We all go home tonight.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.507
- Hey, what are we thinking
for lunch?

05:08.509 --> 05:10.309
What, mexican, chinese,
burgers?

05:10.311 --> 05:12.044
- I'm good with
anything but sushi, all right?

05:12.046 --> 05:14.546
Had a bad experience once, so...
We'll leave it at that.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.681
- What happened?
Did you get sick eating it

05:15.683 --> 05:17.649
Or something?
- Eh, you know what?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.584
Any time somebody says they had
a bad experience with sushi,

05:19.586 --> 05:21.586
It's safe to assume
they got sick from it.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.455
All-in sick,
you know what i'm sayin'?

05:23.457 --> 05:25.457
- Maybe you choked on it.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.371
- Up here.
What's this?

05:39.373 --> 05:41.573
- Look out!
- Damn it!

05:41.575 --> 05:42.841
- Voight!

05:46.780 --> 05:49.614
- Better call it in.
- Yep.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.483
[gunshot]
- sheez.

05:51.485 --> 05:55.721
[gunshot]
popcorn! Popcorn! Popcorn!

05:55.723 --> 05:58.657
[gunshots]

06:03.630 --> 06:06.832
[heavy gunfire]

06:10.804 --> 06:13.405
[heavy gunfire]

06:17.978 --> 06:20.545
- Punch it, go!

06:20.547 --> 06:24.649
[tires squealing]

06:27.888 --> 06:29.621
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You guys all right?

06:29.623 --> 06:31.022
- Yeah, we're fine!
Let's go!

06:31.024 --> 06:32.574
- All right!

06:32.575 --> 06:34.125
Lincoln 5021 emergency,
we have shots fired

06:34.128 --> 06:35.727
By the police.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.162
Roll an ambo to
1400 west roosevelt.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.798
We have multiple
wanted offenders.

06:42.403 --> 06:45.504
- So the second car came
rolling up, guns blazing.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.540
I took cover, returned fire...

06:48.542 --> 06:50.742
The van was clear in
about 30 seconds.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.511
They took off.
I got the plate numbers,

06:52.513 --> 06:54.330
But they came back bogus.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.148
- Yeah, we're real close to
getting an i.D. On this guy.

06:56.150 --> 06:59.818
You okay, kid?
- Yeah, a little close.

06:59.820 --> 07:03.688
- What do we got down here?

07:03.690 --> 07:06.057
- [sighs]
- how you doing?

07:06.059 --> 07:08.693
- Little stupid, they got
the jump on me, al.

07:08.695 --> 07:09.661
- You sure you're okay, man?
Not hit anywhere?

07:09.663 --> 07:11.696
- Yeah.
Yeah.

07:11.698 --> 07:12.898
- No i.D. On the shooter.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.965
Running his prints right now.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.834
- Yeah, truck's been hot
for a week.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.170
Taken in a carjacking
on the west side.

07:18.172 --> 07:19.704
- How much was in
that van up there?

07:19.706 --> 07:22.107
- 40,000.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.109
- 40,000?

07:24.111 --> 07:25.777
That's a hell of a crew
for 40k.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.180
- Yeah, we're thinking
the same thing.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.716
- Is he nice?
- Super sweet.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.118
- But, like, a good cop, right?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.853
- Oh, my god, yeah.
- Yeah?

07:34.854 --> 07:36.587
- The sergeant at his last
precinct just raved about him.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.657
I told you, no more dog cops
like the last three

07:38.659 --> 07:42.060
I partnered you with.
I'm looking out for you, sister.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.629
- Thank you, sarge.
- You're welcome.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.031
Oh, here he is.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.666
Hey, welcome to the 21st.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.618
- Hey, sergeant.

07:49.619 --> 07:51.569
- Sean roman, meet
your new partner, kim burgess.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.904
- Hi, sean.
I'm really looking forward to

07:52.906 --> 07:54.806
Working with you.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.041
- You're messing with me, right?

07:56.043 --> 07:57.543
- What are you talking about?

07:57.544 --> 07:59.044
- Well, on the phone,
you said "tim" burgess.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.847
- Oh, my gosh.
[sighs] egg on my face.

08:01.849 --> 08:06.518
Okay, kim and tim come off
my tongue the same sometimes.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.687
Anyway, this is <i> kim...</i>

08:08.689 --> 08:11.189
Your new female partner.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.257
- Looking forward to it.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.925
- Clearly.

08:13.927 --> 08:17.095
- Sergeant.
- Thanks, bobby.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.864
- What's that about, sergeant?

08:18.866 --> 08:20.765
- Intelligence smoked this guy
at the heist this morning.

08:20.767 --> 08:21.967
Looking for an i.D.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.802
- His name's jeff gamble.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.504
He's a dirtbag
from my last district.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.773
- All right.
Go park it a sec.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.243
Hey, halstead.

08:31.245 --> 08:33.144
Addressed to you,
but mailed to the 28th district.

08:33.145 --> 08:34.980
It sat there for a while

08:34.981 --> 08:36.815
Till the desk sergeant
figured it out.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.015
- It was mailed
six weeks ago.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.717
- Wow, that is some

08:39.720 --> 08:42.287
Real detective work
right there.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.598
- All right...

08:53.600 --> 08:55.100
We have the driver,
lee pritchett.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.801
Worked there three months.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.104
Had a wife and
two-year-old kid at home.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.740
Dead crew member, apparently
we've got a lead on that.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.008
- Yeah, jeff,
i knew him from my last--

09:03.010 --> 09:04.309
- Not yet.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.144
And we've got the shooter
in the armored van.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.681
I.D. And social came back bogus
from the company.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.483
He started work three days ago.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.284
We have calls into the company
to find out who hired him

09:13.287 --> 09:15.720
And who put him
in that van today.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.956
Now.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.559
- D.O.A.'s jeff gamble.
He's got a sheet five feet long.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.894
Possession, domestic battery,
burglary,

09:22.896 --> 09:24.880
Two prior armed robberies.

09:24.881 --> 09:26.865
His cousin, chris gamble, is
basically his partner in crime.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.700
Chris wasn't involved himself,

09:28.702 --> 09:31.002
But i'll guarantee he'll at
least know what jeff was up to.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.939
- Well, you and burgess
go find this cousin.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.941
- All right.
- Yeah.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.943
- Morning, burgess.
- Ruzek.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.644
My new partner, sean roman.

09:39.646 --> 09:40.946
- Hey, man, how you doin'?
- Hey.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.881
- This is my partner.
- Alvin olinsky.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.817
- Hey, sean roman.
We've met.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.919
- Did we?
When?

09:47.921 --> 09:50.689
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.

09:50.691 --> 09:54.593
There's a bunny
on the phone for you.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.862
- Uh, she in jail?

09:57.864 --> 09:59.598
- I...
- Look at the caller i.D.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.199
If it's an 888 number,
that's the jail.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.001
You're gonna get a lot of those.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.669
- 312?

10:04.671 --> 10:06.938
- Take a number.
I'll call her back.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.941
- Okay.
Can i return?

10:16.016 --> 10:18.783
- What's up?

10:29.863 --> 10:32.964
- Jin sent this to me.

10:32.966 --> 10:33.865
- What's on the drive?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.834
- I haven't checked it yet.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.637
- Show it to voight.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.306
- Not until i know
what's on it.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.684
- Steve kot,
state's attorney's office.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.120
I need to speak
with sergeant voight.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.355
- And what do you do at
the state's attorney's office,

10:57.357 --> 10:58.857
Steve?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.959
- I'm an attorney.
- Oh.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.695
It was going good
until you said that.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.929
- Can you just buzz me up?

11:10.937 --> 11:12.704
- Okay, why the visit?

11:12.706 --> 11:14.973
- As you know, my office is
prosecuting oskar bembenek

11:14.975 --> 11:16.074
For murder.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.043
Alvin put the cuffs on him.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.411
- Okay.

11:19.413 --> 11:22.380
- The key piece of evidence
is a shirt of bembenek's

11:22.382 --> 11:24.249
With the d.O.A.'s blood on it.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.317
That shirt was
being transported to a lab

11:26.319 --> 11:28.920
In that van this morning.

11:28.922 --> 11:32.090
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, now why
on earth would you do that?

11:32.092 --> 11:33.958
- Bembenek's attorney
successfully petitioned

11:33.960 --> 11:37.996
The judge to have the evidence
retested at an independent lab.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.031
- Why wasn't this--

11:40.033 --> 11:42.967
I call it crucial bit of
information made known to cpd?

11:42.969 --> 11:44.469
- His attorneys convinced
the judge there may be

11:44.471 --> 11:46.905
Police corruption
involved in the case.

11:46.907 --> 11:50.408
So...Independent lab,
independent transport...

11:50.410 --> 11:52.077
No one was supposed to know.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.412
- So this dna evidence
is gone?

11:54.414 --> 11:57.148
And this psycho's gonna walk.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.085
- If i had to hazard a guess,
i would say yes.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.960
- Oskar bembenek and
his younger brother jacob.

12:08.962 --> 12:12.397
Oskar's run a crime outfit
for the last 25 years.

12:12.399 --> 12:16.768
Prostitution, extortion, drugs,
you name it.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.503
Now oskar never gets
his hands dirty.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.773
He always subcontracts when
it comes to taking people out.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.008
That's how he's lasted so long.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.277
- This murder charge,
what's that about?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.313
- He just had a mistress.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.049
Just wanted to
break up with him.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.450
So he stabs her.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.753
25 times.

12:38.992 --> 12:42.327
His shirt?
It's got her blood on it.

12:44.498 --> 12:47.132
Now, i knew this girl.

12:56.343 --> 12:59.911
I knew this girl.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.946
Josie martin.

13:04.417 --> 13:09.487
I was trying to turn her out
as an informant against him.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.156
[phone rings]

13:11.158 --> 13:15.894
- Intelligence, atwater.
- I'll be back.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.428
- Thanks.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.330
The supervisor from the armored
van company i've been trying

13:19.332 --> 13:21.166
To get a hold of
just went home sick.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.268
- You and halstead, let's go.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.170
- Hey.
Text me the address.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.238
- Gotcha.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.345
- My guy was approached
by some of the guys in the crew

13:34.347 --> 13:35.880
Who pulled off the job.

13:35.882 --> 13:38.149
He wasn't involved.
He was with me all morning.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.551
- Fine.
Great.

13:39.553 --> 13:42.153
All you gotta do is
give me his name.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.222
I'm sure he's got something
on his record, right?

13:44.224 --> 13:45.590
I'll make it look like
that's why i'm picking him up.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.858
Your name will
never be mentioned.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.176
- Come on.

13:48.177 --> 13:49.493
- Me and my whole team could
have got wiped out.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.029
- He wasn't involved.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.330
- I believe you.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.333
I just want his name
to find the guys who did.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.503
Huh?

14:02.042 --> 14:04.442
- So my name won't come up?

14:04.444 --> 14:06.211
- No.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.445
- Because i'm pretty sure
if they're trying to kill you

14:07.447 --> 14:09.013
This morning, they're not gonna
have a problem

14:09.015 --> 14:11.983
Trying to kill me.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.228
- All right.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.966
Here's what i want you to do.

14:27.968 --> 14:31.135
Just...I want you to
keep your mouth shut.

14:31.137 --> 14:34.305
Just drop the whole thing,
all right?

14:36.243 --> 14:38.076
- Okay.
Yeah, i can do that.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.311
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.319
[indistinct,
overlapping chatter]

14:55.161 --> 14:57.395
- Hello, oskar.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.098
- Detective olinsky.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.266
- You mind stepping out
for a second and letting me have

15:01.268 --> 15:05.470
A quick word with your boss?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.108
- Whoa!

15:10.110 --> 15:12.911
- Hey, hey, hey.

15:12.913 --> 15:17.081
It's okay.

15:19.185 --> 15:22.253
- You know, i know you were
behind the heist this morning.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.688
- Heist?
- Oh, yeah.

15:23.690 --> 15:28.660
- I don't think so.
No.

15:28.662 --> 15:31.629
- You remember the old days?

15:31.631 --> 15:34.599
You ran from the police,
you were guaranteed a beating,

15:34.601 --> 15:38.202
But you shoot at the police...

15:38.204 --> 15:40.622
It was guaranteed death.

15:40.623 --> 15:43.041
Now i am considered one of the
last of the old-timers, oskar.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.244
And i am coming for you.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.420
.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.221
- That's the truck
that rammed us.

15:57.222 --> 15:59.022
Forensics already
dusted for prints,

15:59.025 --> 16:01.159
I want you two to go through it
top to bottom.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.460
See if they missed anything.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.129
- You got it, boss.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.098
What are we looking for here?
Traps or something?

16:07.100 --> 16:09.067
- Step aside
before you hurt yourself.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.685
- Hey, yeah, you know...

16:10.686 --> 16:12.302
A simple "i got this"
would suffice, kev.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.672
- I got this.

16:21.581 --> 16:25.183
- So what's on the drive?

16:25.185 --> 16:29.187
- Did you know jin was
working with ia?

16:29.189 --> 16:32.724
- I didn't.

16:32.726 --> 16:37.261
- Any shot voight
was mixed up with them?

16:39.265 --> 16:42.000
- Don't get stupid
on me now, jay.

16:49.376 --> 16:53.678
Luke hendricks?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.181
[continued knocking]

16:57.183 --> 17:00.318
- Body.

17:00.320 --> 17:04.255
Unh! Police!

17:04.257 --> 17:05.289
Clear!

17:05.290 --> 17:06.491
- Police!

17:08.428 --> 17:10.762
Clear!

17:10.763 --> 17:14.699
[exhales]

17:19.204 --> 17:23.207
Yep, that's hendricks.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.309
- Looks like he was trying
to clear out.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.378
- Okay.
So he's working for bembenek...

17:28.381 --> 17:30.715
He hires the shooter
in the armored van,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.817
And then he tips off the crew
when he knows that

17:32.819 --> 17:35.153
We've got a guy in there
and we're following.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.788
- I'll call it in.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.294
[rock music playing]

17:43.296 --> 17:45.430
- You ever work in a bar before?

17:45.432 --> 17:48.066
- Nah.
You?

17:48.068 --> 17:51.402
- No.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.073
You ever work with
a female cop before, roman?

17:55.075 --> 17:56.641
- Yeah.
My last partner was female.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.176
- Hi, sean.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.577
- What's up, lisa?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.345
- Thought you transferred
out of this district?

18:01.347 --> 18:03.448
- I did.
But i'm back on business.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.549
That okay with you?

18:04.551 --> 18:06.117
- I could care less.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.386
Could you make it quick?
It's just me behind the bar.

18:08.388 --> 18:11.289
- You hear about
jeff gamble today?

18:11.291 --> 18:12.474
- I did.

18:12.475 --> 18:13.658
He went out
in a blaze of glory, huh?

18:13.660 --> 18:15.159
- Ah, yeah.
Shooting at cops--

18:15.161 --> 18:16.594
It's...Real glorious.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.862
- Forget i said it.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.464
- We're looking for
his cousin, chris.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.731
You seen him?

18:20.733 --> 18:22.800
- Not in a week or so.

18:22.802 --> 18:26.804
- Well...He walks in,
you call me.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.240
I find out chris was in here,
and you didn't call me,

18:29.242 --> 18:30.842
I'm gonna get pissed.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.678
Like 2009 st. Patty's day
pissed.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.179
- Got it.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.548
- Good.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.120
- What do we got?
- We found something.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.855
Truck hit voight's car
about 35 miles an hour.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.456
Hardly any damage.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.158
- There's a two-inch
steel channel welded

18:47.160 --> 18:48.359
Right behind the bumper.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.772
They were planning on
ramming something.

18:49.773 --> 18:51.184
- It was stolen about a week
ago, so it was definitely

18:51.185 --> 18:52.596
Retrofitted between
then and now.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.398
- And that's quality work
under there.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.501
Talk about a high-end shop.
I can start asking around.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.704
- Bembenek's got a guy who does
custom choppers for him.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.809
Hey, fritz.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.811
Still in the oskar bembenek
business, i take it.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.246
- Not for a long time, no.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.381
- The pickup truck.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.516
You know all about it.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.917
- Pickup?
- Yeah.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.418
- Fritz, look.
We're gonna give you

19:14.420 --> 19:16.454
The benefit of the doubt here,
okay?

19:16.456 --> 19:18.656
When you attached that metal
plate to the stolen truck

19:18.658 --> 19:21.692
You thought, uh, bembenek was
gonna enter it into a...

19:21.694 --> 19:23.828
Demolition derby, if those--
they still exist?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.363
- Yeah, they do.
- They do?

19:25.365 --> 19:26.531
We should go to one of those.
That's fantastic.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.366
See, you're doing great so far.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.268
You didn't know he was gonna
give it to his crew

19:30.269 --> 19:32.169
To try and take out
a couple of cops.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.571
Now that you do know that,

19:33.573 --> 19:35.439
It's probably best that you
wake up a little bit

19:35.441 --> 19:37.775
Before the full force of the cpd
comes down on your ass.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.444
- Listen...
Listen--hey, hey...

19:40.446 --> 19:42.947
We need a connect
between bembenek

19:42.949 --> 19:45.316
And the retrofit on that pickup.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.485
- I wasn't here
when the order came in, okay?

19:47.487 --> 19:49.287
Let me just talk to my guy
who was here.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.690
He's not working today.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.458
- Sooner than later.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.428
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey, hey.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.497
Sooner than later.
- Okay.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.936
- Come in.

20:04.938 --> 20:07.972
- You're gonna want to
take a look at this.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.875
Jin sent it to me.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.894
- Need something?

20:29.896 --> 20:33.497
- No, i don't.
You do.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.466
- Namely?

20:35.468 --> 20:38.302
- A good lawyer.

20:38.304 --> 20:43.407
Partial transcript of
the wire jin had on ya.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.611
Yeah, you leaned on him over
his father's gambling debts,

20:46.613 --> 20:50.715
Forced him to do
off-book surveillance.

20:50.717 --> 20:55.553
Threatened to kill him
if he told anyone.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.288
Well, you know how it works.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.957
Just get out in front of it.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.526
Make a deal.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.629
- If i go down
for jin's murder,

21:04.631 --> 21:06.998
Two things are gonna happen
in quick succession.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.566
I will tell everyone

21:08.568 --> 21:10.368
That you had a deal with
internal affairs.

21:10.370 --> 21:14.505
I'm sure your fellow cops
would love to hear that one.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.440
Then...

21:16.442 --> 21:19.777
I will give a full and accurate
account of our relationship.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.913
And they will come for your job.

21:22.915 --> 21:26.517
So you can go
down the tubes, voight...

21:26.519 --> 21:29.487
Or you and i can just
walk away from each other,

21:29.489 --> 21:33.491
And jin's murder
stays unsolved.

21:33.493 --> 21:36.594
Just another guy that got
in over his head in chicago.

21:38.064 --> 21:42.633
I don't need to tell you
there've been many.

21:48.908 --> 21:49.407
.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.642
[phone rings]

21:50.643 --> 21:51.876
- Chicago police department.
Intelligence.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.311
How may i help you?
- Hey.

- Let me see your hands!

35:38.303 --> 35:39.469
- Put 'em up!

35:39.471 --> 35:40.537
- Stay in the car.
What are you doin'?

35:40.539 --> 35:41.738
- It's all good!
It's all--

35:41.740 --> 35:43.340
[gunshots]

35:43.342 --> 35:45.142
- No! No! No!
Jacob!

35:45.144 --> 35:46.443
- Up where i can see 'em!

35:46.445 --> 35:47.444
Put your hands up
where i can see them, now!

35:47.446 --> 35:49.146
- No!
Jacob!

35:49.148 --> 35:50.480
- Don't move!
- Jacob!

35:50.482 --> 35:51.515
[grunts]

35:56.421 --> 35:59.422
- You shot my brother.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.424
- It hurts, tough guy?

36:01.426 --> 36:02.692
What's that, tough guy?
Huh?

36:02.694 --> 36:04.728
Come on.

36:04.730 --> 36:09.166
- Jacob!

36:09.168 --> 36:10.667
- Lincoln 5021 emergency.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.236
We have shots fired
by the police.

36:13.238 --> 36:15.605
Roll and ambo to
35th and hamilton.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.440
- Copy that, lincoln 5021.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.912
- Voight.

36:21.914 --> 36:25.182
They're ready for you.

36:28.754 --> 36:31.621
- Gentlemen.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.357
- There've been some serious
allegations made against you

36:34.359 --> 36:36.459
By stillwell.

36:36.461 --> 36:37.928
Backed up by recorded
conversations where

36:37.930 --> 36:40.830
You promised to give him
part of your street tax.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.465
Now we're gonna need
your badge and gun

36:42.467 --> 36:44.367
Until we conduct a thorough
investigation because this--

36:44.369 --> 36:46.853
- I'm sorry to interrupt,
commander,

36:46.854 --> 36:49.338
But may i have a minute alone
with chief o'leary?

36:49.341 --> 36:52.943
Literally, 60 seconds.

36:52.945 --> 36:55.412
- That's fine.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.546
- Let's go.

37:09.828 --> 37:13.230
- Sheldon jin feared
for his life.

37:13.232 --> 37:16.900
His best line of defense
was his technical skills.

37:16.902 --> 37:21.271
So he recorded everything.

37:21.273 --> 37:24.007
He threw his net out as far as
he could, i guess you could say.

37:26.778 --> 37:29.846
There's a hell of a lot on
that thumb drive he left behind.

37:35.587 --> 37:39.522
I'm not one to judge, but...

37:39.524 --> 37:40.790
I will make an exception

37:40.792 --> 37:43.860
When it comes to
someone who's judging me.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.610
- Alyssa martin?

38:00.612 --> 38:01.645
- Yeah.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.713
- Follow me.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.682
- Am i in trouble?

38:05.684 --> 38:07.384
- Why?
Should you be?

38:07.386 --> 38:09.586
- No.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.788
I-i mean--no.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.556
- Then follow me.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.029
- Hey, jellybean.

38:19.031 --> 38:20.563
- Am i in trouble?

38:20.565 --> 38:22.065
- Not at all.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.800
We had a big bust today.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.670
200,000 was recovered.

38:26.672 --> 38:30.573
I made the argument--
successfully as it turns out--

38:30.575 --> 38:32.609
That that money stemmed from
your original tip on the heist.

38:32.611 --> 38:34.411
So...

38:34.413 --> 38:37.681
As a registered informant,
you're entitled to 10%.

38:37.683 --> 38:40.650
Sergeant platt is here because
this needs to be witnessed.

38:40.652 --> 38:41.985
Sign here.
And here.

38:52.564 --> 38:54.030
That's $20,000.

39:01.106 --> 39:04.040
- [emotional laugh]

39:04.042 --> 39:05.842
- Get your ass to
kansas city, kid.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.812
- [sniffles]
yeah.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.680
You're never
gonna see me again.

39:10.682 --> 39:11.715
- I hope not.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.820
- Thank you.

39:16.822 --> 39:21.124
Thank you.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.692
[laughs]

39:35.574 --> 39:38.375
- You know if
bunny's working tonight?

39:40.979 --> 39:43.646
- Erin.

39:43.648 --> 39:47.584
- Hey, mom.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.619
Do me a favor.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.054
You need to get a hold of me,

39:51.056 --> 39:52.689
Don't call my work.

39:52.691 --> 39:55.125
Here's my email.

39:55.127 --> 39:58.495
- I'm getting married, erin.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.562
- Great.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.498
Email me.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.647
- What the hell's so urgent?

40:17.649 --> 40:20.884
- You got a cop you work with
named halstead?

40:20.886 --> 40:23.987
- Yeah, why?

40:29.561 --> 40:31.694
- Hey, get this.

40:31.696 --> 40:33.029
Voight beat the suspension.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.098
- Thought he was
facing termination.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.434
- Call it macaroni, dude.
I don't know.

40:37.436 --> 40:38.535
He's gonna be
back in the office tomorrow.

40:38.537 --> 40:39.702
He beat it.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.538
- Jay.
- Whoa.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.672
- Al.

40:42.674 --> 40:43.773

40:43.775 --> 40:45.742

40:45.744 --> 40:47.844
- Hey.
- Hey, hi.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.112
Um...

40:49.114 --> 40:50.647
Let me have
a quick word with you.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.715
Come here.

40:56.655 --> 40:58.788
- What the hell's going on, man?

40:58.790 --> 41:00.723
- Oskar bembenek just put
a $100,000 bounty

41:00.725 --> 41:03.059
On your head
for killing his brother jacob.

41:47.072 --> 41:49.138
- Andrew jin.

41:53.845 --> 41:57.947
Pay off your gambling debts.

41:57.949 --> 42:00.016
Your wife needs you.
