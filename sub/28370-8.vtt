Or what?Or... I'll fire you.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.402
[laughing]:
Okay.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.934
[laughter, crowd chatter]

09:53.767 --> 09:55.725
Hey, Murphy.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.422
Oh, hey.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.207
Just here to see Chels.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.600
Yeah, I sort of
put that together.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.079
She's, uh... she's just
in the back.

10:02.123 --> 10:04.081
Cool.But how's work?

10:04.125 --> 10:06.562
Did you get assigned
a new case or whatever?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.912
Yeah.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.784
How's Chloe?

10:10.827 --> 10:12.699
Good. She's good.Good.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.527
Well, tell her I said hi.Yeah, will do.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.923
MAX:
Hi, baby.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.622
Hi.That your bag?

10:22.665 --> 10:24.319
Yeah.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.061
Ready?

10:27.104 --> 10:29.498
I thought we were
gonna grab a drink.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.239
It's okay.
Let's just go. [grunts]

10:31.282 --> 10:33.589
Oh, um, hey. Hey.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.590
Come on, Pretzel.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.592
[Murphy grunts]

10:36.636 --> 10:38.768
Bye, Dean.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.422
Bye.

10:40.465 --> 10:41.902
CHELSEA:
Hi.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.468
Hey.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.438
Okay, here we are.

10:56.481 --> 10:59.006
I already put a bowl of food
and water out for Pretzel.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.355
Mm.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.969
Come here.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.929
Okay, don't laugh at me.What?

11:08.972 --> 11:11.714
But I Googled how to show
a blind person a new space.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.109
Oh, my God. You're such a loser.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.937
Shut up.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.679
All right. Okay,
to your left is a wall.

11:19.722 --> 11:22.507
And on the floor there's
a shoe rack, so be careful.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.772
Dart board.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.035
Okay.
Yep.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.472
Be a coat rack.
Wall. Mm-hmm.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.213
And then you're gonna come
to a doorway.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.041
Yes.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.738
And through the doorway
is my bedroom

11:35.782 --> 11:37.479
and the bathroom,
Okay.

11:37.522 --> 11:40.656
which is a glorious bathroom
that only the two of us use.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.963
Bathroom. Got it.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.182
And if you, uh,
follow my voice,

11:45.226 --> 11:47.315
over here is the couch,
which I moved

11:47.358 --> 11:49.317
to be more like
your apartment.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.145
Ah.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.974
Where are you? Ow!
Oh!

11:54.017 --> 11:55.410
Ow. Oh, that is not

11:55.453 --> 11:56.890
where the coffee table
is in my apartment.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.500
Ah. I'm-I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? Okay?

11:58.543 --> 11:59.893
Yeah. Shin's broken,
but yeah, I'm fine.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.808
Stupid table.
I'm so sorry.

12:01.851 --> 12:05.550
Um, luckily,
I also Googled what to do

12:05.594 --> 12:08.423
if a blind person crashes
into something in a new space.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.164
Oh, yeah?

12:10.207 --> 12:12.514
Get on my back.
What?

12:12.557 --> 12:14.037
I must take you
to the bedroom immediately

12:14.081 --> 12:15.082
and remove
all your clothes.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.736
Okay.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.999
Let's go. [grunts]

12:19.042 --> 12:20.609
Careful of my shin.

12:20.652 --> 12:23.351
[both grunt]Oh. Da-doo, da-doo.

12:23.394 --> 12:27.094
Hey. [inhales]

12:27.137 --> 12:31.272
We never have the whole
apartment to ourselves.

12:31.315 --> 12:32.752
Aren't you loving this?

12:34.797 --> 12:36.843
Mm. I'm... [sighs]
I'm sorry, baby.

12:36.886 --> 12:39.062
I'm just...
I'm still in my head.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.542
You just need to take
a deep breath.

12:40.585 --> 12:41.761
It'll help you relax.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.198
A deep breath?

12:44.241 --> 12:47.114
I saw someone die.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.464
And what if... [inhales sharply]
someone saw me?

12:49.507 --> 12:52.641
Worries are just prayers
for things that you don't want.

12:52.684 --> 12:55.905
You can't put negative thoughts
out there. Hmm?

12:59.256 --> 13:00.388
Okay, I don't know
why you can't

13:00.431 --> 13:02.216
understand what a
big deal this is.

13:02.259 --> 13:06.524
I just don't think dwelling
is gonna help.

13:16.099 --> 13:20.103
And before I knew it,
h-he was right in front of me.

13:20.147 --> 13:23.063
I tried to brake, and...

13:23.106 --> 13:24.891
There was nothing
you could have done.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.502
All right, we know that.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.721
We're just trying to gather
witnesses from the scene.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.335
Did you see
anyone at all?

13:34.378 --> 13:36.337
Just some girl.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.905
I think she was coming
to help him,

13:38.948 --> 13:41.690
but when she saw what happened,
she ran away.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.257
Do you remember
what she looked like?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.302
[phone ringing in distance]

13:56.139 --> 13:59.403
[scoffs]
That's Murphy's roommate.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.498
All right, thank you guys
for coming.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.152
Now, before we get started,

14:09.196 --> 14:12.373
I want everyone to give
a round of applause...

14:13.417 --> 14:15.245
...to Hank and Joy.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.772
They created a
wonderful company.

14:20.816 --> 14:21.904
Thank you.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.993
And, as we all probably
have heard,

14:24.037 --> 14:25.560
there's a new sheriff in town.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.521
[laughs] Um...

14:30.565 --> 14:32.567
'Cause I bought...
I bought the company.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.829
Not yet.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.049
You guys already cashed
the checks.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.921
Uh, we're still finalizing the
paperwork, but it's-it's...

14:38.965 --> 14:40.923
It'll be done shortly.
Just continue, Felix.

14:40.967 --> 14:44.231
Okay. Um...

14:44.274 --> 14:47.321
Now, I know I'm the boss now,

14:47.364 --> 14:48.800
but I just want you guys

14:48.844 --> 14:50.802
to treat me like
the same old Felix.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.195
All right?MURPHY: Yes.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.197
Annoying then,
annoying now.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.895
Okay, that kind of behavior
actually needs to stop.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.767
[phone buzzing]FELIX:
Now... [sighs]

14:58.810 --> 15:00.725
Let's talk toilet paper.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.466
Now, I'm not pointing fingers...

15:02.510 --> 15:03.728
[dog barking in distance]

15:03.772 --> 15:06.644
Hello?

15:06.688 --> 15:10.431
Oh. Hi, Dea... uh, Officer.

15:13.129 --> 15:16.567
Great. Great.
Okay, we'll see you then.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.787
Okay. Okay. Bye.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.182
Okay. Tomorrow. Okay.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.665
The other night,
Jess told Chelsea

15:27.709 --> 15:29.624
she forgot to charge her
for a pop.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.452
Not exactly talking about
a diabolical mastermind.

15:31.495 --> 15:34.237
She was ten feet away when
Wesley got flattened by a truck.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.978
That can't be
a coincidence.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.241
She might know something
about Tyson's other killer.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.939
Chels. Hey, I didn't
s-see you there.
Hey.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.592
Oh, is it okay?
The front desk guy told me

15:41.636 --> 15:42.942
I could just come back.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.944
Yeah. No.
Uh... let's go eat.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.249
Wait a second.
I can't believe

15:46.293 --> 15:47.990
you guys actually use these.[grunts]

15:48.034 --> 15:49.513
It looks like SVU.

15:49.557 --> 15:52.603
Okay, you guys can
head on out now.
Yeah.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.475
Wait a second. Why is
Jess's picture on the board?It's nothing.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.608
Do you guys think she's
involved in Tyson's murder?

15:57.652 --> 15:59.001
No. We just think she
might have some information.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.437
What kind of information?

16:00.481 --> 16:02.265
Can you just forget
everything you saw, please?

16:02.309 --> 16:03.701
I want one of those
pictures of me.
[scoffs]

16:03.745 --> 16:04.876
[laughing]:
Can you get me one?

16:04.920 --> 16:07.140
Thanks for the heads-up, Tom.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.445
What exactly did he say?

16:08.489 --> 16:10.099
He said that someone
saw me at the scene

16:10.143 --> 16:11.535
and that they had
some questions for me

16:11.579 --> 16:13.146
and that I need to come in.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.799
Damn.
Did they say
who saw you?

16:14.843 --> 16:17.280
No. I mean,
there was no one around.

16:17.324 --> 16:18.803
[Jess sighs]

16:18.847 --> 16:21.197
The driver.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.025
Oh, my God,
the driver must have seen me

16:23.069 --> 16:24.679
after you guys went to the car.

16:24.722 --> 16:27.290
I told you to let me
call the police.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.640
Why didn't you just
get in the car and drive away?

16:29.684 --> 16:32.382
Well, I-I'm sorry, because
I saw someone get flattened.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.819
Okay, stop. You guys.
You need to fix this for her.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.865
Jess is not gonna go
to jail because of me.

16:37.909 --> 16:38.998
Jail?

16:39.041 --> 16:40.390
No. You're not.

16:40.434 --> 16:41.870
Sorry. You're not
gonna go to jail.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.915
Just... these bimbos
are gonna fix it.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.179
Look, there's no actual
evidence, right?

16:47.180 --> 16:48.398
Well, there's the watch.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.313
What watch?His... I've...

16:50.357 --> 16:52.141
I got rid of it already.
It was in her car.Okay. We're good.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.317
My car.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.189
[laughing]:
Oh, my God. My car.

16:56.232 --> 16:57.842
They're gonna, like,
find his DNA

16:57.886 --> 17:00.758
or whatever in my car.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.586
I'll fix the car, okay?
I got a guy.

17:02.630 --> 17:03.892
Great. Guy.
I love "a guy."

17:03.935 --> 17:05.241
I'm gonna use "a guy" now.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.591
I'm not... I'm not
cut out for this.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.551
What am I gonna tell
the police?

17:10.594 --> 17:12.248
We'll come up with a story.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.033
Oh, God.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.860
What?
She can't lie.

17:15.904 --> 17:19.038
She twitches her nose.
It's, like, a whole thing.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.343
Is that true?

17:20.387 --> 17:21.953
[laughing]:
No.

17:23.433 --> 17:26.915
Oh, man.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.092
JESS:
And I got in my car,

17:30.136 --> 17:33.182
and I drove away.

17:33.226 --> 17:34.531
You did it again.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.751
I did?
Yeah.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.709
[groans] I'm never gonna
get away with this.

17:38.753 --> 17:41.234
Hey, don't manifest that.What?

17:41.277 --> 17:43.410
I mean, I just... I told you

17:43.453 --> 17:45.760
to think positively,
and you didn't,

17:45.803 --> 17:47.544
and look where you are.

17:47.588 --> 17:51.418
You think me getting called
into the police station

17:51.461 --> 17:53.289
is 'cause I manifested it?

17:53.333 --> 17:54.595
How else do you explain it?

17:54.638 --> 17:55.726
I don't know.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.251
A... a million other ways.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.732
Vanessa, I don't...
I don't have time

18:01.776 --> 18:03.908
for your hippy garbage
right now.

18:03.952 --> 18:06.389
My hippy garbage?
Yes.

18:06.433 --> 18:09.436
Okay. Forgive me
for trying to help you.

18:09.479 --> 18:13.092
No. If you wanted to help me,
you would listen to me,

18:13.135 --> 18:15.485
and you would hug me.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.922
You're, like, the worst lesbian
in the entire universe.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.621
Well, maybe because I'm not,
like, an actual lesbian.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.800
Okay. Whoa.Jess, I didn't...

18:25.843 --> 18:29.108
No, it's-it's fine.

18:29.151 --> 18:33.808
I will just manifest that
I'm not a phase for you

18:33.851 --> 18:36.419
and we will be so
happy together.

18:36.463 --> 18:39.814
What I meant
is I love you.

18:41.816 --> 18:42.773
Okay? I'm sorry.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.427
I...
I'm... No.

18:44.471 --> 18:46.821
Babe.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.176
[power tool whirring]

18:54.220 --> 18:58.137
The whole, uh, normal couple
thing lasted all of one night.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.790
Oh, come on, we're getting
the car repaired.

18:59.834 --> 19:00.878
That's totally normal.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.967
Uh, we're getting
a dead guy's DNA

19:03.011 --> 19:04.447
out of my best friend's trunk.

19:04.491 --> 19:05.840
We're having a group hang.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.711
That's something.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.365
How's Jess look?

19:09.409 --> 19:11.541
Go again.
Okay.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.804
I follow Murphy
using an app.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.372
Come on, Jess,
that's not even a lie.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.548
I know! It's 'cause
my brain knows

19:18.592 --> 19:20.202
that it's leading to a lie.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.073
All right. Just go again.[exhales]

19:22.117 --> 19:23.466
All right? You got this.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.468
No. I suck at this.

19:25.512 --> 19:26.817
[chuckles]
Yeah, you do.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.211
All right.
You may not be telling

19:29.255 --> 19:32.519
the whole truth, but you're
telling a version of it.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.739
Right.
Yeah. So?

19:35.783 --> 19:38.525
So, y-you feel terrible about
what happened that day, right?

19:40.440 --> 19:41.528
There. Right there.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.573
Make them see that.

19:43.617 --> 19:47.577
When you tell the story, think
about what actually happened.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.189
Darnell, I do not want to think
about what actually happened.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.494
I'm trying to move on.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.888
Maybe move on after tomorrow.

20:04.377 --> 20:08.250
JULES:
Jess, the man who hit Wesley
I.D.'d you at the scene.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.730
Can you tell us
why you were there?

20:09.773 --> 20:11.166
Yes.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.604
Um, I track Murphy using an app.

20:16.606 --> 20:20.131
And, on that day,
I saw that she was kind of

20:20.175 --> 20:25.485
far out of town, so I-I got
nervous and I called her.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.269
[exhales]

20:27.313 --> 20:31.665
And I was nervous because
she wasn't picking up,

20:31.708 --> 20:37.323
so I decided to leave work
and track her.

20:37.366 --> 20:38.933
And, of course,
at that time,

20:38.976 --> 20:43.198
I didn't know that Wesley
had her phone.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.767
So, when I got to the spot

20:46.810 --> 20:48.464
that the app
said she was at,

20:48.508 --> 20:50.423
I got out of my car,

20:50.466 --> 20:54.427
and I didn't see her anywhere.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.430
JULES:
But you saw Wesley.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.345
Yeah.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.303
That's when
I saw Wesley.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.305
But then he took off,

21:03.349 --> 21:05.481
like he was running

21:05.525 --> 21:09.006
from someone or something.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.228
[crying]:
And he wasn't... He...

21:13.272 --> 21:16.492
He wasn't looking
where he was going, and he...

21:16.536 --> 21:19.408
That's when he got hit
by the car.

21:22.193 --> 21:24.152
And I was so...

21:24.195 --> 21:27.460
I was so scared,
because I thought he had...

21:27.503 --> 21:30.289
I thought he had done something
to Murphy.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.813
So I got in my car,

21:32.856 --> 21:34.336
and I went to go find

21:34.380 --> 21:36.077
my friend.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.688
I'm so... And I know
I should have called the police,

21:38.732 --> 21:39.907
and I'm so sorry.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.822
I'm so, so sorry
I didn't do that,

21:41.865 --> 21:43.345
but it was just...

21:43.389 --> 21:46.653
It was the last thing on my mind
at that point.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.263
I just...

21:48.307 --> 21:51.179
I just really needed to find
my friend.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.486
It's okay, Jess.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.531
You should have called us,

21:55.575 --> 21:58.708
but failing to
report an accident

21:58.752 --> 22:00.188
is not a crime in itself.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.495
Oh.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.497
So I can go?

22:04.540 --> 22:06.716
Yes.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.502
[sighs] Okay. Okay.

22:09.545 --> 22:10.894
Thank you
for your time.

22:10.938 --> 22:13.288
Thank you.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.859
[door closes]What do you think?

22:18.902 --> 22:21.514
There's no way that girl
killed anyone.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.080
Yeah.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.390
[whoops]

22:28.434 --> 22:29.870
There she is.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.088
[whoops]

22:31.132 --> 22:33.047
Yeah, baby.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.396
Yeah.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.616
[sighs][chuckles]

22:36.659 --> 22:39.706
Dude, I cried.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.229
You cried?
No.
What?

22:41.272 --> 22:42.230
Jess.
JESS: Yeah.

22:42.273 --> 22:43.797
Like, actual tears.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.539
I told you
you could pull it off.

22:46.582 --> 22:47.801
This feels weird.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.977
Like, I know how to lie,
and I don't...

22:50.020 --> 22:52.762
I don't know what to do
with this new power.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.634
All right, y'all.
I'm headed home.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.331
Hey, I just...

22:56.375 --> 22:57.898
Thank you so much.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.116
Yeah, anytime.Well, I'm hoping

22:59.160 --> 23:00.466
that this is, like,
a onetime thing, but...

23:00.509 --> 23:03.294
Right. Right.Thank you. Oh.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.557
[chuckles]Bye.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.167
We're gonna...
we're gonna head out, too.Bye.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.082
What? Really? Why?

23:08.125 --> 23:09.562
Yeah, because you said Vanessa's

23:09.605 --> 23:11.259
on her way here,
and after what she said to you,

23:11.302 --> 23:12.478
I might punch her
in the face.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.262
No, dude, it's fine.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.090
It's not fine, Jess.
She knows you're insecure

23:16.133 --> 23:17.787
about how you're
the first girl she's dated,

23:17.831 --> 23:20.268
and she's, like,
throwing it in your face.

23:20.311 --> 23:21.443
That's not true.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.445
It is true.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.579
We'll see you later, okay?Okay.

23:26.622 --> 23:27.754
Bye, Jess.Yeah.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.277
Bye.MURPHY:
Good job today.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.452
Thanks.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.632
You want another one?Mm-hmm.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.329
[phone chimes]

23:45.336 --> 23:46.599
Hey, are you okay?

23:46.642 --> 23:48.514
No.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.472
I hate today.

23:54.998 --> 23:57.610
Hey.

23:57.653 --> 24:00.221
Listen.What?

24:00.264 --> 24:02.789
You can't tell anybody
I told you this,

24:02.832 --> 24:05.966
but I happen to have
some inside info.

24:06.009 --> 24:08.359
Dean doesn't think
you're Tyson's other killer.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.493
What are you talking about?

24:13.016 --> 24:15.149
What are you talking about?Vanessa.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.542
Oh.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.413
Sorry. Go back.

24:19.849 --> 24:22.330
Tyson's otherkiller?

24:22.373 --> 24:23.984
Apparently there's, like,
two people involved.

24:24.027 --> 24:25.376
Why did you just tell me that?I don't know.

24:25.420 --> 24:26.726
I don't know.
Because I thought that you were

24:26.769 --> 24:27.857
upset because you thought
you were a suspect,

24:27.901 --> 24:28.989
and I was trying to help.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.338
Chelsea. [groans]

24:30.381 --> 24:32.383
What am I gonna tell Murphy?

24:32.427 --> 24:34.908
She's just now
starting to move on.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.344
You can't tell Murphy
anything, okay?

24:36.387 --> 24:37.867
Dean is gonna kill me.

24:37.911 --> 24:40.348
Oh, right, like I just
can't tell Murphy this.

24:40.391 --> 24:43.003
This is the most important
thing to her in the world,

24:43.046 --> 24:44.918
finding out who
killed Tyson.

24:44.961 --> 24:47.529
Just let Dean
figure it out, okay?

24:47.573 --> 24:50.097
Murphy never should have been
doing this in the first place.

Hello. Drink.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.943
So, how's your night?

25:09.986 --> 25:12.902
Oh. Uh, yeah,
just great. Yours?

25:12.946 --> 25:14.687
Mm, terrible.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.732
I just went on the
worst date ever.

25:16.776 --> 25:20.040
This girl brought me
to her improv show.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.563
Yeah.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.087
Mm. Yikes.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.699
So I need a million drinks.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.918
Can I get you one?

the plants yesterday, so...

Oh, I watered them.

You did.

Yeah. Noticed they were dry.

I just really like being here.

anywhere else.

to someone who cares

29:47.829 --> 29:48.830
about it as much as I do.

Are you being for real
right now?

Yes.

I'm so angry.

40:22.855 --> 40:24.422
Yeah, I mean,
I've been there once or twice.

40:24.465 --> 40:25.727
It's a Chinese restaurant.

40:25.771 --> 40:27.990
Now, let's eat. Come on.

40:28.034 --> 40:30.558
Okay, I need to go see Dean.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.995
He won't call me back, so I need
to force him to talk to me.

40:33.039 --> 40:34.562
Right now?

40:34.606 --> 40:36.999
Well, I need to find out if he
knows who else killed Tyson.

40:37.043 --> 40:38.871
And that can't wait
until tomorrow?

40:38.914 --> 40:40.916
I thought
we were gonna be like...

40:40.960 --> 40:42.875
a normal couple, you know?

40:42.918 --> 40:44.485
That's not me, Max.

40:44.529 --> 40:45.747
I tried.

40:45.791 --> 40:48.184
Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow.

40:48.228 --> 40:49.490
Come on. Good. Up.

Murphy?

40:59.500 --> 41:01.763
Thanks for returning
all of my phone calls.

41:01.807 --> 41:03.852
Why didn't you tell me
Tyson had another killer?

41:03.896 --> 41:06.333
[sighs]Forward, Pretzel.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.859
Won't you come in?MURPHY:
You should have told me.

41:10.903 --> 41:13.253
[sighs] Despite what
you think, Murphy,

41:13.296 --> 41:15.037
I don't have to
tell you everything.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.431
Or anything, at all.Look, I'm sorry.

41:17.475 --> 41:20.216
I shouldn't have gone
to the mall.

41:20.260 --> 41:22.697
[sighs]
It's fine.

41:22.741 --> 41:25.570
We told you you were safe,
so that's... it's on me, too.

CHLOE:
Okay, I was thinking

41:27.920 --> 41:31.706
either Bring It On
or Mamma Mia 2.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.186
Both of those movies suck.

41:34.274 --> 41:35.580
Murphy?

41:35.623 --> 41:37.756
Hi, Chlo.

41:37.799 --> 41:39.453
Can she stay for movie night?

41:39.497 --> 41:41.281
No, no, no.
I wouldn't want to intrude

41:41.324 --> 41:43.109
on such an exclusive event.Please, please?

41:43.152 --> 41:45.503
No, i-if you want
to, you can.

41:45.546 --> 41:46.895
Yeah?
[chuckles]

41:46.939 --> 41:49.071
Yes.

41:49.115 --> 41:51.900
Oh, but I'm not gonna watch
any of that garbage.

41:51.944 --> 41:53.511
Well, that's good.
Actually, I was thinking,

41:53.554 --> 41:54.903
what about True Lies?

41:54.947 --> 41:56.992
What even is that?Ew. No.

41:57.036 --> 41:59.342
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Tom Arnold, the two Arnolds.

41:59.386 --> 42:00.909
They were never together again.

42:00.953 --> 42:01.910
Sounds boring.Maybe.

42:01.954 --> 42:03.651
Not gonna watch that. Jaws.

Jaws. Jaws. Jaws.
Oh, God.
