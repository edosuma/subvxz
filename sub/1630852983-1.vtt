00:27.794 --> 00:31.731
Gentlemen and gentlemen,
Mr. Mark Vanderhill!

00:33.500 --> 00:38.139
Men first! Men first!
Men first! Men first!

00:38.272 --> 00:39.307
- Mark.
- Mark.

00:39.439 --> 00:40.374
- I freakin' love you.
- Thank you.

00:40.507 --> 00:41.342
You the fuckin' man.

00:41.474 --> 00:42.742
- You, ha-ha!
- Love you.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.811
The way you changed
my fuckin' life.

00:44.946 --> 00:47.714
I have a message to spread
that I believe

00:47.847 --> 00:50.650
can save thousands
if not millions of lives.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.619
I owe everything to you, man.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.989
He understands what I'm about,
and that's why I joined his movement.

00:55.122 --> 00:56.924
We're a movement
that remains prepared.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.393
Mark, you taught me how to
reclaim my power as a man.

00:59.526 --> 01:01.963
You see it, you want it,
you take it.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.531
Setting the example.

01:04.664 --> 01:06.434
Mark saved me from
being a beta male.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.701
That's natural.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.036
That's an expression
of dominance.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.238
The most important thing
that has happened...

01:11.372 --> 01:12.472
It's a natural movement.

01:12.605 --> 01:13.840
...is the creation
of the MFM.

01:13.975 --> 01:15.109
MFM.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.410
MFM, baby.

01:16.543 --> 01:19.813
The male exerts dominance
over the female.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.949
It's fucking science!

01:22.782 --> 01:24.952
Oh, he's so sexist. Oh!

01:25.086 --> 01:26.686
- Fuck these hos.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.923
Well, feminists claim
they want equality,

01:29.056 --> 01:30.857
but what they really want
is power.

01:30.992 --> 01:32.892
- "No" don't mean "no."
- "No" means try harder.

01:33.027 --> 01:35.795
<i>This is the sort of imagery the
liberal media doesn't want you to see.</i>

01:35.930 --> 01:40.034
<i>White, straight men
enjoying themselves.</i>

01:40.167 --> 01:42.736
That's when those fucking
liberal pansies are gonna listen.

01:42.869 --> 01:44.405
- And if they don't...
- Boom!

01:44.537 --> 01:47.774
- Boom.
- My M4 Carbine rifle will do the talkin' for you.

01:47.908 --> 01:51.145
Time to show these snowflakes
who's fuckin' boss!

01:51.278 --> 01:54.315
You wanna know what we think
about your sensitive politics

01:54.448 --> 01:55.916
and these issues, yeah?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.518
Fuckin' that's what we think!

03:19.433 --> 03:21.235
- All right.
- Thanks.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.737
You goin' huntin'?

03:24.871 --> 03:28.576
Oh, I just like
to stay prepared.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.277
Okay, there's nothing
wrong with that.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.744
Can I get a...

03:31.878 --> 03:33.613
A cheeseburger deluxe,
bloody rare,

03:33.746 --> 03:35.182
with barbecue sauce
on the side?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.683
Hey, you know
your girl's order.

03:36.816 --> 03:38.185
Yeah, I know
everybody's order.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.687
Um, well, I'm gonna throw
a curveball at you

03:40.820 --> 03:43.324
and get a slice
of cherry pie.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.757
Honestly?

03:44.891 --> 03:47.894
The cherry pie
is, like, kinda trash.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.863
It's just like Foster's
and they microwave it.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.565
But the key lime pie
is homemade.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.200
Key lime sounds great.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.667
All right, key lime.

03:58.139 --> 03:59.140
Joey.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.975
- Mike!
- Hey.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.042
- Hey!
- Hey.

04:02.176 --> 04:02.842
What...

04:02.977 --> 04:04.078
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hi!

04:04.211 --> 04:05.712
- It's so good to see you.
- You too!

04:05.845 --> 04:07.214
You look amazing!

04:07.348 --> 04:08.916
Oh! Well, thank you.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.551
What are you doing here?

04:10.683 --> 04:14.787
Um, I got into law school,
um, so my social life is over.

04:14.922 --> 04:15.923
- Wanted to...
- Okay.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.124
...come hang for a bit,
yeah.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.690
So I graduated
a semester early.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.827
- Cool. Good for you.
- What about you?

04:20.961 --> 04:24.365
You know, just...
I'm just here.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.401
- It's... It's awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.537
Um, I'm havin' a party tonight.
Totally come.

04:29.669 --> 04:33.673
It's gonna be just bonfire
and drinks and... yeah.

04:33.806 --> 04:35.543
Sure. That sounds fun, okay.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.077
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:37.211 --> 04:39.013
- Well, I'll get out of your way.
- Okay. Okay, cool.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.780
Yeah, I'll see you later.

04:40.915 --> 04:42.049
- Okay.
- See you.

04:42.183 --> 04:43.083
Bye.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.420
- Uh, we good?
- Yeah.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.057
Roll, roll, roll it.
I'm feelin' it.

04:50.191 --> 04:51.325
And we're back, fellas.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.893
It's Mark Vanderhill,
your b-b-boy.

04:54.028 --> 04:56.997
Dr. Vanderhill here,
Vanderhill Files, part two.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.433
Two. T-Two. Part two. Two.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.069
In the field. All right, I wanna
review part one really fast

05:02.203 --> 05:03.703
'cause it's important.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.906
We talked about
identifying a target.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.108
Ta... Ta... Tar... Target.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.158
Janine is pregnant again.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.193
- Alan and Marie's daughter?
- Mm-hmm.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.795
- She just had one!
- I don't know why you surprised.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.797
Alan and Marie
had 11 children.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.732
They must think pretty high
of themselves,

05:32.865 --> 05:35.469
assuming the world needs
that much of them in it.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.271
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey, baby.

05:37.404 --> 05:38.706
Ooh, I'm hungry!

05:38.838 --> 05:41.275
Not too hungry to say grace.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.645
The dishwasher
broke at work,

05:44.777 --> 05:46.180
so Marco's got us
hand washing,

05:46.313 --> 05:48.048
which is unfair,
'cause that's not my job.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.017
It's not unfair, baby.
That's work.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.185
Whoa, wait, wait a minute.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.654
She a waitress,
not a dishwasher.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.656
Now, Marco want her
to do more work,

05:55.788 --> 05:58.359
- he need to give her more money.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you, Pop.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.161
You're gonna spoil her mind
with that talk.

06:01.295 --> 06:03.998
Marco's a bully.
Always has been.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.832
You push right back
at him.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.234
- Oh!
- I will, Pop.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.236
Vanderhill Files, part two.
We're in field.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.338
We talked about opener. Do you know
about the Vanderhill technique?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.839
Sorry, don't mean
to alarm you.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.541
Just... I gravitated
towards you.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.310
Feels like you could
use a little somethin'.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.912
You're a little messy,
but, you know, you're cute.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.247
- Can you cook?
- No.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.149
Oh, well, then that's
enough of that.

06:22.283 --> 06:24.318
- You're beautiful, I mean...
- Thank you.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.819
All the makeup. Is this your
natural skin tone or is it...

06:26.954 --> 06:28.622
Is it a little darker
without the makeup?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.324
Can I see?

06:30.457 --> 06:33.060
You saw the negging work.
Negging kicks ass.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.664
Neg... Neg... Negging.

06:36.796 --> 06:37.965
<i>Like you saw it, right?</i>

06:38.098 --> 06:39.466
You saw it, right?
Right? Right? Right?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.834
I wanna show it to you
and I wanna give it to you,

06:41.969 --> 06:44.672
so that you can use this tonight.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.944
Yes.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.148
Got you there. Nope.
You wish, motherfucker.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.449
What about you?

06:55.582 --> 06:58.052
You're not planning
on serving coffee

06:58.185 --> 07:00.554
for the rest of your life,
are you?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.156
Um...

07:02.289 --> 07:04.525
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
I did not mean that like that.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.293
No. No, you're not wrong.

07:06.427 --> 07:10.931
I, um... I thought
about being a nurse.

07:11.065 --> 07:13.833
You can get your license
without going to college.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.203
Um, I know. That's weird.

07:16.337 --> 07:19.606
Uh, so, yeah, I...
I can do online classes

07:19.740 --> 07:20.840
and still go to school.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.310
Oh, no, go to work.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.580
That sounds like... That...

07:26.714 --> 07:29.216
I mean, that sounds like
something you'd be amazing at.

07:29.350 --> 07:31.585
You'd be great at that.

07:31.719 --> 07:32.852
Thanks.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.531
I feel kind of sick.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.033
I need to go home.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.769
You can crash here
if you want.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.638
I like you
and I'm having fun,

07:51.772 --> 07:54.908
but... I need to go.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.777
Okay.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.012
- Um, let me walk you home, okay?
- Okay.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.995
<i>I'm pretty sure
I pulled out in time,</i>

08:15.129 --> 08:17.731
<i>but just in case,</i>

08:17.865 --> 08:20.601
you should probably
take Plan B.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.203
Bye.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.159
No.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.096
<i>No.</i>

08:52.966 --> 08:54.501
<i>Joey.</i>

09:02.276 --> 09:05.112
So maybe there's
somethin' here after all,

09:05.245 --> 09:06.580
despite the faults?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.749
All right. And that's...

09:08.882 --> 09:10.217
Right on my heart line.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.385
And...

09:12.252 --> 09:14.455
- And your name was?
- Tanya.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.056
Tanya.

09:16.190 --> 09:18.392
Mark. Mark Vanderhill.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.061
Right, and that's
how we do it, right?

09:21.195 --> 09:23.163
It's simple. It's easy.
It's nothing you have to think about.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.209
Joey.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.363
What happened?

10:29.496 --> 10:33.600
I just hurt my hand.
Nana fixed me.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.736
How you doing, Joe?

10:35.869 --> 10:38.672
Just powering through.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.477
<i>You sound like Nana talkin'.</i>

10:48.415 --> 10:52.085
<i>You know that strength that
your grandmother talked about?</i>

10:52.219 --> 10:54.154
<i>That's how she survived.</i>

10:56.290 --> 10:59.059
<i>But it was also
her only option.</i>

11:01.862 --> 11:03.230
I know.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.265
She dealt with
it by dealin' with it,

11:05.399 --> 11:07.401
<i>whatever it was.</i>

11:07.534 --> 11:10.270
That don't mean
the same go for you.

11:10.404 --> 11:13.373
There's different ways
to show strength.

11:30.857 --> 11:31.993
That's all?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.493
A cup of coffee,
black and sweet.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.128
- Okay.
- Just how God made you.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.175
Joey!

11:51.878 --> 11:53.714
Sorry. Sorry, um...

11:53.847 --> 11:57.784
It's okay. It's all good.
It's... It's all good.

11:57.919 --> 11:59.219
Yeah, yeah.

11:59.353 --> 12:01.121
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.857
I just...
Can I get you a, um...

12:14.936 --> 12:16.169
Jesus.

12:23.610 --> 12:24.745
Thanks.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.680
No problem.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.951
You okay?

12:30.084 --> 12:31.418
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.492
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:39.027 --> 12:41.194
Um, uh, no.

12:41.328 --> 12:45.899
Uh, I am not fine.

12:46.034 --> 12:47.701
You got plans tonight?

12:47.834 --> 12:50.470
Um, no,
it's been a long work week.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.074
Come get a drink with me.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.442
I'm not really
in a social mood.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.980
Well, if you change
your mind,

12:59.113 --> 13:00.781
I'll be at yours at 8:00.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.421
<i>They use their
front legs to snare their prey</i>

13:07.554 --> 13:09.623
<i>with reflexes so quick</i>

13:09.756 --> 13:12.325
<i>they are difficult to see
with the naked eye.</i>

13:12.459 --> 13:14.628
<i>This poor male cricket...</i>

13:15.862 --> 13:17.230
Hey, Nana, I'm goin' out.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.067
Okay.
Who you goin' out with?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.233
Uh, someone I met at work.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.868
What's her name?

13:22.003 --> 13:24.138
<i>...its prey,
camouflaged by the green...</i>

13:24.271 --> 13:25.639
I don't know.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.374
You don't know
your friend's name?

13:27.507 --> 13:29.643
What kind of person
doesn't tell you their name?

13:34.848 --> 13:38.785
You know, you can come up and knock
on the door like normal folks!

13:38.920 --> 13:41.122
- Sorry.
- My gran.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.256
- It's all good. Get in.
- Yeah.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.891
Go inside!

14:00.007 --> 14:03.945
I feel like I should tell you
that, um...

14:06.981 --> 14:08.882
...I'm not gay.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.322
Okay. I'm not tryin'
to sleep with you.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.424
I just want to
show you something.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.327
- Show me what?
- You'll see.

14:28.136 --> 14:29.971
What's she singin' about?

14:32.339 --> 14:33.573
Revenge.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.274
I'm confused.
This is where we're havin' a drink?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.975
Yeah. Come on.

15:52.786 --> 15:53.820
Hello.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.860
Fala, this is Joey.
Joey, this is Fala.

15:59.994 --> 16:02.395
- This is her home.
- Hi, I'm Josephine.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.332
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.034
Oh. Oh.

16:08.336 --> 16:10.004
All right,
come on, bitch.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.639
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.609
You want it
to have power.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.644
You're right, Fala.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.329
Is this like a secret bar
or somethin'?

16:35.462 --> 16:37.999
Well, um, actually,
this place is usually pretty quiet,

16:38.132 --> 16:41.135
but some of our friends are getting
married, so it's about to get wild.

16:41.269 --> 16:42.802
You want to go
to that too!

16:42.937 --> 16:45.872
I do, but, girl,
it's just the way how we gotta do this.

16:46.307 --> 16:47.741
'Sup, Reggie?

16:47.874 --> 16:49.076
Hi, guys.

18:13.027 --> 18:14.061
Hello.

18:14.195 --> 18:16.063
Can I have two whiskeys?

18:22.036 --> 18:24.138
Don't worry.
We don't bite.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.672
Thanks.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.610
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

18:32.313 --> 18:34.614
Ah.

18:34.748 --> 18:36.750
How was that?

18:36.883 --> 18:38.419
Good.

18:40.454 --> 18:42.689
This is crazy.

18:43.391 --> 18:44.624
But do you work here?

18:44.758 --> 18:47.962
No, um,
I work for Sal and Fala.

18:48.095 --> 18:50.364
We help people get out
of bad relationships,

18:50.498 --> 18:53.334
get off the street,
um, teach self-defense classes.

18:53.467 --> 18:54.567
Stuff like that.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.937
All right, bitches!

18:58.305 --> 19:01.275
It's time for Hexus!

19:01.409 --> 19:03.177
Whoo!

19:03.310 --> 19:06.147
Make some fuckin' noise!

19:06.280 --> 19:09.050
On the count of three,
follow me. Yo, ready?

19:09.183 --> 19:11.118

19:11.252 --> 19:13.686

19:55.795 --> 19:57.897
<i>She needs somebody.</i>

20:03.938 --> 20:07.074
She reminds me of you

Cherry Bomb,

20:36.971 --> 20:39.907
Hey, Reg,
check out what Lily made.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.977
Fully functioning
EMP grenade.

20:43.110 --> 20:45.312
Ooh!

20:45.446 --> 20:46.981
This will come in handy.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.286
Who's the cupcake?

20:53.887 --> 20:56.056
Oh, uh, that's Joey.
She's my friend.

20:56.190 --> 20:58.259
- She needs to use your bathroom.
- Yeah.

21:01.562 --> 21:02.930
Hey.

21:31.091 --> 21:34.962
- I gotta run an errand. You want to come with?
- Yeah.

21:35.963 --> 21:37.932
What is
all of this stuff?

21:38.065 --> 21:40.867
Careful.
This is a pin camera, okay?

21:41.001 --> 21:42.903
It records video, audio,

21:43.037 --> 21:45.805
basically makes secrets
not so secret.

21:47.041 --> 21:48.108
Right.

21:48.242 --> 21:50.444
Hey, let's go.

21:59.353 --> 22:00.454
What did she say?

22:00.588 --> 22:03.424
Oh, uh, she said that
you're a good dancer.

22:03.557 --> 22:04.757
Oh. Thank you.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.061
Yeah, we're goin'
back there.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.297
You got it.

22:47.067 --> 22:50.604
Hey, will you wait here?
Babushka's kind of weird with new people.

22:50.738 --> 22:51.972
Yeah.

22:53.707 --> 22:56.110
Babushka, we're comin' in!

22:56.243 --> 22:59.846
Don't shoot, Babushka.
It's Regina and Beatrice.

23:02.149 --> 23:03.417
Let's go, Babbo.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.718
Hey, Babbo.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.053
I'll tell you right now,

23:06.186 --> 23:08.956
this stuff was not easy
to come by.

23:11.325 --> 23:12.626
My cardigan?

23:12.760 --> 23:15.129
I like your, um...
all your patches.

23:17.064 --> 23:19.866
You're wild, Babbo.
Okay, we gotta go.

23:25.406 --> 23:26.440
Let's go.

23:29.376 --> 23:31.945
I'd tell you to be careful
with that stuff,

23:32.079 --> 23:34.682
but it only affects the Y chromosome.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.517
You girls have a good trip.

23:36.650 --> 23:38.352
We will, Babbo.

23:38.485 --> 23:41.055
- And be sure and pull over if you're gonna sleep.
- We will, Babbo!

23:41.188 --> 23:45.292
If you stop by Milfred Farm, pick me
up some of that strawberry moonshine.

23:45.426 --> 23:47.227
- We will, Babbo!
- We will, Babbo!

23:47.361 --> 23:49.862
One, two, three.

23:51.699 --> 23:53.866
Crazy cat.

24:11.985 --> 24:13.253
You want anything?

24:13.387 --> 24:15.923
- No, thanks.
- Yup. I'm good.

24:16.056 --> 24:17.890
I'm gonna take a leak.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.623
Unfucking real!

24:49.757 --> 24:52.593
You're gonna embarrass me like that.
Are you fucking serious? Huh?

24:53.594 --> 24:55.162
Hey!

24:55.295 --> 24:57.865
Look at me,
you fucking drunk!

24:57.998 --> 25:00.067
Jesus Christ, you're sloppy!

25:03.137 --> 25:05.372
Maybe you made your point,
yeah?

25:06.206 --> 25:09.076
Nobody asked you,
soul sister.

25:10.043 --> 25:11.645
Doesn't seem like
she's arguing much.

25:11.779 --> 25:14.248
She's not arguing
because she's a fucking idiot.

25:14.381 --> 25:16.984
Lucky I don't smack her
in the mouth.

25:22.556 --> 25:25.559
Honestly, you're lucky I don't
smack you in the fucking mouth.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.528
I'd like to see you try.

25:29.062 --> 25:31.665
Fucking bitches!

25:50.284 --> 25:52.219
Tonight's your lucky night,
asshole.

25:52.352 --> 25:55.122
We're giving away
free etiquette lessons.

25:55.255 --> 25:56.657
Next time
you gotta pay up.

26:03.163 --> 26:05.299
You need a ride?

26:40.100 --> 26:44.338
Well, I think
we deserve a shot.

26:54.581 --> 26:59.186
Um, hey, do you think that what
just happened was, like, bad?

27:03.156 --> 27:05.759
- You guys are not gonna believe what fuckin' happened.
- What happened?

27:07.594 --> 27:10.597
I don't know. I'm like kinda shaken up.
It feels weird.

27:12.967 --> 27:17.337
I don't think that there's anything weird
about making men like that feel unsafe.

27:20.207 --> 27:22.142
What if the police
find out?

27:25.178 --> 27:26.613
You think he's gonna
go to the cops

27:26.747 --> 27:30.083
and tell them that he got
beat up by a bunch of girls?

27:31.084 --> 27:33.287
Come here.

27:36.123 --> 27:39.293
Listen, she doesn't belong
here and you know it, okay?

27:39.426 --> 27:42.696
So I think we should just
send her home and move on.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.064
Dude, what is your problem?

27:44.197 --> 27:45.866
What?
Who is Tommy Collin?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.037
He is this fucking ruthless fuckboy
we went to school together with.

27:49.169 --> 27:51.805
What's my problem?
She doesn't fucking belong here, dude.

27:51.940 --> 27:54.308
Nobody fuckin' belongs here.
That's the whole fucking point.

27:54.441 --> 27:55.910
He just threw me
on the ground.

27:56.044 --> 27:58.111
I feel like we've all paid our dues.
We belong here...

27:58.245 --> 27:59.780
Paid our dues.
What does that even...

27:59.914 --> 28:01.916
He was much more graphic.
We went to school together.

28:02.050 --> 28:04.351
Smacked him in the fucking
mouth with a bar flashlight.

28:04.484 --> 28:06.286
Knocked out four
of his fuckin' teeth.

28:06.420 --> 28:10.324
And then, like,
it was denial and embarrassment,

28:10.457 --> 28:12.092
and anger, then disgust.

28:12.225 --> 28:14.428
Angie, we've been together
since foster care.

28:14.561 --> 28:17.097
You know, we travel around the
world, fuckin' shit up.

28:17.230 --> 28:18.532
- Ain't takin' no names.
- Da-da-da-da.

28:18.665 --> 28:20.267
What are you sayin' about me
over there, sis?

28:20.400 --> 28:22.336
I'm sayin' that I got
the beauty and the brains.

28:22.469 --> 28:25.639
Oh, that's okay, but I got the fuckin'
right hook. Don't you forget it.

28:26.873 --> 28:29.176
Turn that shit up!

29:59.967 --> 30:02.070
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:02.202 --> 30:04.939
I didn't mean to scare you.

30:07.307 --> 30:10.544
Can I make you
some breakfast?

30:13.480 --> 30:17.851
Well, Regina seems to have
taken quite a liking to you.

30:25.492 --> 30:27.894
She told me
about last night.

30:30.764 --> 30:32.232
You all right?

30:34.634 --> 30:36.904
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

30:38.605 --> 30:42.009
Did the violence upset you?

30:43.111 --> 30:45.345
I, well, freaked out
and froze.

30:45.479 --> 30:49.649
I wanted to help, but...

30:49.783 --> 30:52.586
Violence can be
paralyzingly intense.

30:52.719 --> 30:55.889
You were rightfully scared.

30:56.023 --> 30:57.724
I guess.

30:57.858 --> 31:01.695
But the girls weren't.
They just stepped right up.

31:01.828 --> 31:05.766
But you'd, uh,
call the cops next time?

31:06.433 --> 31:08.035
They aren't
gonna do nothin'.

31:08.169 --> 31:09.904
What'd you say?

31:12.572 --> 31:15.308
The cops aren't
gonna do anything.

31:21.782 --> 31:25.418
Well, I couldn't
agree with you more.

31:25.552 --> 31:28.555
The girls just knew
what to do.

31:28.688 --> 31:30.490
I wish
I could be like that.

31:34.195 --> 31:35.896
You can.

31:40.467 --> 31:41.701
Eat up.

31:49.010 --> 31:51.311
Uh, thanks for the ride.

31:51.444 --> 31:53.313
Are y'all
hangin' out later?

31:53.446 --> 31:54.916
We leave tonight.

31:55.049 --> 31:56.683
Where are you going?

31:57.884 --> 31:59.386
It's not all weddings
and parties.

31:59.519 --> 32:01.488
We got work to do.

32:02.522 --> 32:04.391
What kind of work?

32:04.524 --> 32:07.794
Kind of like a
clean-up-the-streets program.

32:09.964 --> 32:12.566
Like last night,
but all over the state.

32:13.733 --> 32:14.901
Oh.

32:18.272 --> 32:19.840
You gotta ask a girl.

32:19.974 --> 32:22.276
I'm not gonna
make it easy on you.

32:22.409 --> 32:24.111
You think I could come?

32:24.245 --> 32:27.380
Yeah, I think you could.

32:27.514 --> 32:30.350
- I mean I don't wanna intrude.
- Shut up. You're not intruding.

32:30.483 --> 32:31.953
But just think about it.

32:32.086 --> 32:34.255
If you're not cool with
what happened last night,

32:34.421 --> 32:36.523
we can just hang
when I get back.

32:37.591 --> 32:39.327
Cool. Okay.

32:39.459 --> 32:40.694
Okay, bye.

32:40.827 --> 32:43.763
Oh, oh, oh. Just let me...

32:43.897 --> 32:47.500
- My seat belt. It was on.
- Yeah. Yeah, it was.

32:51.538 --> 32:53.607
You said you were attacked
by two Black males

32:53.740 --> 32:55.809
who mugged you
and then smashed your car.

32:55.943 --> 32:57.611
That's exactly
what happened.

32:57.744 --> 32:59.679
You can't smoke in here.

33:02.849 --> 33:04.352
The thing is,
I don't see it.

33:04.484 --> 33:06.486
I see you pinnin' a girl
pretty good

33:06.620 --> 33:09.689
and then gettin' your ass
handed to you, though.

33:12.059 --> 33:14.028
See, that... that...
that is irrelevant.

33:14.161 --> 33:16.364
Those bitches still
have to pay for my car.

33:16.496 --> 33:20.268
You know that intentionally misleading a
police officer is a felony, Mr. Miller.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.502
Why don't we call it even?

33:28.575 --> 33:30.144
You will hear
from my father.

33:30.278 --> 33:31.678
Can't wait.

33:36.117 --> 33:37.084
<i>Hey, Grandma.</i>

33:37.218 --> 33:39.020
<i>Uh, I just wanted
to let you know</i>

33:39.153 --> 33:41.956
<i>I am goin' away
for the weekend.</i>

33:42.089 --> 33:46.426
<i>Um, I'm goin' camping
with my new friends.</i>

33:56.037 --> 33:58.605
So we're just
taking anyone with us?

33:59.806 --> 34:02.009
Look, she doesn't know
the protocols, Regina.

34:02.143 --> 34:03.810
She's gonna get
somebody killed.

34:03.945 --> 34:06.914
<i>But I didn't want you to worry.</i>

34:07.781 --> 34:09.716
<i>I'm in good hands.</i>

34:10.184 --> 34:11.152
<i>I love you.</i>

34:11.284 --> 34:12.353
- You look great.
- Thanks.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.888
- Yeah, I'm glad you came.
- Me too.

34:15.022 --> 34:16.958
Yeah.

34:22.429 --> 34:23.830
Hey.

34:25.598 --> 34:27.766
You seem like a smart girl.

34:29.869 --> 34:31.938
This is not a holiday.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.975
- All right?
- Mm.

34:34.108 --> 34:37.643
So if you're gonna be here,
you're gonna contribute.

34:38.578 --> 34:41.581
You will be counted on.

34:42.283 --> 34:43.817
All right.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.688
Thanks, Sal.

34:50.925 --> 34:52.960
Ever since we were little kids,
I've always been better

34:53.094 --> 34:54.996
and I'm always
gonna be better.

34:55.129 --> 34:56.730
Okay, shit-talker.

35:10.543 --> 35:13.546
- Exactly. Get your ass, let's go.
- Yeah, whatever! Let's...

35:13.680 --> 35:15.383
It's that time
of the year again.

35:15.515 --> 35:16.951
We're hittin' the road tonight.

35:17.084 --> 35:19.487
Now, the target
of our focus this year,

35:19.619 --> 35:22.889
MFM, Men's First Movement.

35:23.024 --> 35:25.393
Was your standard group
of passive fascists,

35:25.525 --> 35:27.694
but they have recently
become involved

35:27.827 --> 35:31.631
in a series of hate crimes
and various assaults.

35:31.765 --> 35:34.035
Now, the leader
is Mark Vanderhill.

35:34.168 --> 35:37.405
You wanna know what we think
about your sensitive politics

35:37.537 --> 35:39.273
and these issues, yeah?

35:39.974 --> 35:41.608
Fuckin' that's what we think!

35:41.741 --> 35:44.445
Mark Vanderhill began
his illustrious career

35:44.577 --> 35:46.613
four years ago
as an online pickup artist

35:46.746 --> 35:48.416
under the name Arc Angel.

35:48.548 --> 35:49.749
And we're back, fellas.

35:49.883 --> 35:51.118
Back... Back... Back, fellas.

35:51.252 --> 35:53.887
Six months after his show
on DH1 was canceled,

35:54.021 --> 35:56.723
Mark unveils his new blog,
The Master's Burden,

35:56.856 --> 36:00.127
in which he has undergone
not just a physical makeover

36:00.261 --> 36:03.397
but a seemingly
ideological one as well.

36:03.531 --> 36:05.799
Consent politics.
I mean, fuck.

36:05.933 --> 36:08.102
Have we all become faggots
out here, fellas?

36:08.235 --> 36:11.771
'Cause here's what I know.
You see it, you want it, you take it.

36:11.906 --> 36:13.407
That's what the MFM
is really all about.

36:13.541 --> 36:16.310
You know, you hear these
libtards talk about safe spaces.

36:16.444 --> 36:18.546
They don't really understand
what that means.

36:18.678 --> 36:20.014
This is a safe space.

36:22.882 --> 36:26.753
Mark became an alt-right icon
and formed MFM

36:26.886 --> 36:29.756
after a successful series
of lectures entitled

36:29.889 --> 36:31.891
"The Necessity of Dominance."

36:34.295 --> 36:36.230
That's the way we've done it
for thousands of years,

36:36.363 --> 36:38.232
and there's nothing wrong
with that.

36:38.365 --> 36:39.500
<i>That's natural.</i>

36:39.632 --> 36:41.001
<i>That's an expression
of dominance.</i>

36:41.135 --> 36:42.669
<i>Every species on the planet
does it.</i>

36:42.802 --> 36:46.606
The male exerts dominance
over the female.

36:46.739 --> 36:49.076
It's fucking science!

36:51.744 --> 36:52.913
The way you gotta work
with the gun.

36:53.047 --> 36:54.915
You do it quick
in a satisfying way.

36:55.049 --> 36:57.118
Same way I've always
talked about with women.

36:57.251 --> 36:58.818
Can't be too gentle
with them.

36:58.953 --> 37:00.787
You gotta make sure
they understand

37:00.921 --> 37:02.990
how you wanna use them.

37:03.124 --> 37:06.893
And of course,
we expect them to fight back

37:07.027 --> 37:08.828
because it wouldn't be any fun
if they didn't.

37:08.963 --> 37:10.797
That's your fuckin' head!

37:10.931 --> 37:13.900
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.

37:15.202 --> 37:18.172
You've never even been outside
of this town before, have you?

37:18.305 --> 37:20.107
I mean, my aunt lives
in Philadelphia.

37:20.241 --> 37:22.276
Just stay the fuck
out of my way.

37:22.409 --> 37:26.380
Their increased militarization
has been cause for concern.

37:26.514 --> 37:29.116
The MFM has some of the
best shooters in the world.

37:29.250 --> 37:31.185
<i>He has had notable association</i>

37:31.318 --> 37:32.752
<i>with mass shootings.</i>

37:32.886 --> 37:34.622
Whoa! Fuck, yeah!

37:34.754 --> 37:37.291
<i>He's also linked to the
bomber at the Ogden abortion clinic.</i>

37:37.424 --> 37:39.826
That's what we're fuckin' talking about.
You see that?

37:39.960 --> 37:43.597
All investigations
have mysteriously ceased.

37:43.730 --> 37:45.599
Perfect.

37:45.732 --> 37:48.868
Seems like he might be gettin'
a little help from the inside.

37:49.003 --> 37:52.573
The MFM is hosting a rally
in Littleson.

37:52.705 --> 37:56.377
Littleson is the hub
of human trafficking

37:56.510 --> 37:58.379
<i>in this nation.</i>

37:58.512 --> 38:02.815
It is a town run by a deeply
corrupt police force,

38:02.950 --> 38:06.353
the head of which
is Chief David Morill.

38:06.487 --> 38:08.788
Now, that would be him.

38:08.923 --> 38:11.325
Now, he's a very dangerous man.

38:24.771 --> 38:26.473
It's so goddamn dark out here.

38:26.607 --> 38:27.840
Hmm.

38:31.345 --> 38:32.379
Thanks.

38:34.548 --> 38:36.317
Wait, she can hear perfectly?

38:36.783 --> 38:37.717
Lily?

38:37.850 --> 38:39.286
Yeah, totally.

38:41.188 --> 38:44.225
She won a singing competition
when she was younger,

38:44.358 --> 38:47.461
released a whole bunch of songs,
got semi-famous.

38:50.631 --> 38:53.968
One guy in particular
kept sendin' her stuff.

38:54.101 --> 38:56.604
Eventually, he started asking
her a bunch of weird shit.

38:57.571 --> 39:01.275
So she rejected him,
and then six months later,

39:01.408 --> 39:03.944
<i>he showed up
to one of her shows,</i>

39:04.777 --> 39:06.380
<i>knocked her unconscious,</i>

39:06.513 --> 39:09.316
<i>sprayed lighter fluid
up her nose and down her throat</i>

39:09.450 --> 39:11.352
<i>and set her on fire.</i>

39:12.953 --> 39:15.990
Holy fucking shit.

39:16.590 --> 39:17.857
Yeah.

39:17.992 --> 39:19.727
In court, he said something
along the lines of,

39:19.859 --> 39:23.197
"If she's not gonna sing for me,
she's not gonna sing for anyone."

39:26.567 --> 39:30.504
I, uh... I won't tell her
that you told me that.

39:31.605 --> 39:34.408
I wouldn't have told you
if I didn't know it was okay.

39:37.678 --> 39:38.912
Right.

39:52.059 --> 39:54.395
And you? How did you, uh...

39:55.262 --> 39:57.298
How'd you
end up here?

40:00.167 --> 40:02.835
My stepfather
murdered my mother.

40:06.106 --> 40:07.874
And I couldn't forgive him.

40:31.532 --> 40:33.233
Marney.

40:33.367 --> 40:34.635
Here, sir.

40:34.768 --> 40:37.171
Bring the truck around.
Gotta go check something.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.872
Yeah.
Time to hit the streets.

40:40.007 --> 40:41.809
What? We're not hittin'
anything, okay?

40:41.942 --> 40:44.411
Just bring the truck around.

40:46.246 --> 40:48.015
- Just go get the truck.
- Right.

41:11.638 --> 41:12.906
Where are we?

41:57.418 --> 41:58.952
Put your gun down,
Marney.

41:59.086 --> 42:01.922
I'm in my legal right to put
down a pair of trespassers.

42:02.055 --> 42:03.557
We're not here for you,
Fala.

42:03.690 --> 42:05.692
You got some balls
showin' up here.

42:11.999 --> 42:15.936
Fala, these MFM guys
are complete psychos.

42:16.069 --> 42:18.238
And they're in deep
with the police.

42:18.907 --> 42:21.074
Nice seeing you, Vernon.

42:34.087 --> 42:37.658
You know, a while back,
federal office suspected

42:37.791 --> 42:41.228
that cops in Littleson are
runnin' a human trafficking ring.

42:43.330 --> 42:44.665
They sent an agent
undercover,

42:44.798 --> 42:47.434
and she was a tactically
trained field officer.

42:49.269 --> 42:51.071
She turned up
missin' a head.

42:51.205 --> 42:54.374
I ain't willin' to let that happen to
Sal, even if you are.

42:55.976 --> 42:57.544
All right?

43:21.068 --> 43:23.303
Oh, my God. Shit.

43:27.942 --> 43:30.143
Yo, don't say anything.

43:31.178 --> 43:32.713
Just stay calm.

43:37.718 --> 43:39.453
Let Beatrice do the talking.

43:39.586 --> 43:42.723
Black folks get killed talking
back to the police around here.

43:57.304 --> 43:59.039
How're we doin' today,
ladies?

43:59.172 --> 44:00.274
Good.

44:00.407 --> 44:02.242
What are you ladies
up to?

44:03.610 --> 44:05.512
Just goin'
on a road trip.

44:06.113 --> 44:07.548
Oh, yeah? Where to?

44:13.320 --> 44:15.689
I asked you
ladies a question.

44:18.091 --> 44:20.227
I'm sorry, Officer,
but, um,

44:20.360 --> 44:22.529
you haven't explained
why you stopped us.

44:22.663 --> 44:24.298
I mean, you didn't
just pull us over

44:24.431 --> 44:27.134
because you saw
two Black women driving?

44:33.707 --> 44:35.275
A lot of drugs
coming through here.

44:35.409 --> 44:36.743
You, uh, mind
if I call...

44:36.877 --> 44:39.212
State law says an officer
may not detain a motorist

44:39.346 --> 44:41.615
for a period of time longer
than reasonably necessary

44:41.748 --> 44:44.184
to complete the
investigation of a violation.

44:44.318 --> 44:45.954
But you may not detain us
while you wait

44:46.086 --> 44:47.654
for additional officers
to arrive.

45:01.535 --> 45:03.704
You ladies
watch your back now.

45:07.874 --> 45:09.077
Know your rights.

45:10.444 --> 45:12.846
Oh, my God,
that was incredible.

45:13.780 --> 45:15.115
How did you know that?

45:15.248 --> 45:17.284
My grandfather was
a district court judge.

45:17.417 --> 45:19.720
Sounds like a smart man.

45:19.853 --> 45:21.956
He was a complete
and utter cocksucker.

45:22.090 --> 45:25.459
I thank the stars every day
that cancer ate his brain

45:25.592 --> 45:28.195
and every pedophilic
thought in it.

45:39.206 --> 45:41.608
So, what are we doing?

45:44.778 --> 45:46.880
- Police work.
- Right.

45:47.015 --> 45:51.618
But we're out of Guthrie, so we don't
have any jurisdiction here, so...

45:51.752 --> 45:54.287
We're keepin' the people that
live in our jurisdiction safe,

45:54.421 --> 45:57.591
even if they go outside
of our jurisdiction.

45:57.724 --> 46:00.094
Even if they continually
make questionable decisions

46:00.227 --> 46:02.295
that put themselves
and others in danger.

46:04.765 --> 46:07.334
Okay, yeah.
That's... That's much clearer.

46:10.737 --> 46:11.772
Thanks.

46:19.880 --> 46:23.183
<i>Tensions are high after
disciplinary hearings at NCU</i>

46:23.316 --> 46:26.087
led to a unanimous decision
of non-conviction

46:26.219 --> 46:27.587
by the disciplinary board.

46:31.491 --> 46:33.794
The case at hand
was based off of claims

46:33.928 --> 46:35.429
of sexual assault and rape

46:35.562 --> 46:39.499
<i>made against the NCU chapter
of the Pi Iota Gamma house.</i>

46:39.633 --> 46:42.703
The claim was made after
this photograph surfaced.

46:42.836 --> 46:45.405
<i>Members of the student body
were protesting</i>

46:45.539 --> 46:47.008
- <i>as soon as the decision came in.</i>
- We need to call Sal.

46:48.910 --> 46:52.846
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!

46:52.980 --> 46:56.583
Clean it up! What the fuck you gawkin' at?
Clean it up!

46:57.484 --> 46:59.653
Today, justice was served.

46:59.786 --> 47:03.857
After three long months of
bullshit persecution and slander,

47:03.991 --> 47:06.660
those fuckin' admin faggots
finally learned a lesson

47:06.793 --> 47:09.563
that we have all known
for a long time!

47:09.696 --> 47:12.299
You can't stop Pi Gam!

47:13.233 --> 47:16.803
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!

47:16.938 --> 47:20.841
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!
Pi Gamma! Pi Gamma!

47:26.680 --> 47:28.216
We're 24 miles away
from that.

47:28.348 --> 47:29.649
You know anyone over there?

47:29.783 --> 47:31.351
Rudy lives
in the next town over.

47:31.485 --> 47:33.720
They're the ones
that sent the video to Lily.

47:33.854 --> 47:35.388
We're not just gonna
let this go, right?

47:35.522 --> 47:37.858
We can't be everywhere.
You know that.

47:37.992 --> 47:39.893
Come on, Beatrice.
You know that shit was fucked up.

47:40.027 --> 47:43.030
Look at what these boys
are doin' to girls out...

47:43.164 --> 47:45.632
<i>...complaints
of sexual assault and rape.</i>

47:51.705 --> 47:54.775
<i>...complaints
of sexual assault and rape.</i>

47:57.577 --> 47:59.247
All right, enough.

47:59.379 --> 48:02.649
We go, we talk to Rudy...

48:03.483 --> 48:04.986
And we help.

48:15.595 --> 48:18.032
I spoke to
three different girls.

48:18.166 --> 48:21.535
The photo in the news
was just the tip of the iceberg.

48:24.337 --> 48:27.407
Apparently, these guys
film everything.

48:29.776 --> 48:32.879
They have a room in the house
called "the vault."

48:33.480 --> 48:35.116
It's reinforced

48:35.249 --> 48:37.985
and it has
its own security system.

48:38.920 --> 48:41.022
This is it.

48:47.727 --> 48:50.664
Distract and retrieve.

48:51.698 --> 48:54.434
No, no, no. You would have
to find a way of bypassing

48:54.568 --> 48:56.270
the house's security system.

48:56.403 --> 48:57.671
Lily.

49:01.641 --> 49:03.543
All right, girls...

49:05.879 --> 49:08.216
we're gonna
have to move fast.

49:08.348 --> 49:09.516
Regina and I
will take lead.

49:09.649 --> 49:10.985
I think Joey
should roll with me.

49:11.118 --> 49:14.322
I mean, college kids.
She'd be perfect.

49:14.454 --> 49:17.390
Regina, she...
But she doesn't know...

49:17.524 --> 49:18.458
I was asking Sal.

49:18.592 --> 49:20.027
I can do it.

49:20.161 --> 49:21.628
- Okay.
- Hey, I wanna do it.

49:21.761 --> 49:22.964
Fine.

49:25.699 --> 49:27.534
Let's go pick out
some clothes.

49:41.115 --> 49:45.019
Beatrice tells me
you're going after MFM?

49:46.988 --> 49:50.824
Sal, those aren't
some frat boys.

49:52.525 --> 49:54.661
The cops, this whole town...

49:58.299 --> 50:01.835
Grayson says people go
missing there all the time.

50:04.704 --> 50:07.574
Sal, I'm always gonna
have your back,

50:07.707 --> 50:10.344
but you need to know

50:10.477 --> 50:12.479
this destruction,
the violence,

50:12.612 --> 50:14.248
you know it's gonna
come back to you.

50:14.382 --> 50:15.615
It always does.

50:23.590 --> 50:26.559
You're just gonna
have to trust me.

50:36.870 --> 50:39.006
<i>We need to get invited inside.</i>

50:39.140 --> 50:40.540
- Hi!
- Hi!

50:40.674 --> 50:42.642
<i>They're frat boys,
so this shouldn't take much.</i>

50:42.776 --> 50:46.213
We were touring the campus and we heard
that this is the house to party at.

50:46.347 --> 50:49.482
So, we were just wondering if
you guys wanted to throw down.

50:52.219 --> 50:55.488
We got... We got all... We got the
other floors, got a bedroom and a bed.

50:55.622 --> 50:57.524
- Oh, wow!
- Um, you know.

50:59.659 --> 51:02.029
I did that.
I put the bras up there.

51:02.163 --> 51:04.864
- I love that chandelier.
- Yeah, it's, like, arty.

51:04.999 --> 51:08.635
I brought some of
my uncle's moonshine, you guys.

51:09.836 --> 51:12.572
To you all getting everything
that you deserve in life.

51:14.241 --> 51:15.642
- I'll take that!
- Yeah.

51:15.775 --> 51:17.144
- Take that!
- Cheers!

51:20.081 --> 51:22.950
I'm so fucked up. Oh, my God.

51:23.084 --> 51:24.418
I know!

51:27.021 --> 51:29.991
Um, can I use
your bathroom?

51:35.695 --> 51:39.133
What the fuck?
How do you, like, chug a beer?

51:50.378 --> 51:52.213
Back it.
Open the throat up.

51:52.346 --> 51:53.713
- Show me.
- Okay, open the throat.

51:53.847 --> 51:55.483
- You know all about that, right?
- I do.

51:55.615 --> 51:56.716
Like that?

51:56.850 --> 51:58.152
Oh, my God,
he's gonna beat you.

51:58.285 --> 51:59.353
He's gonna beat you.

51:59.487 --> 52:00.787
Loser!

52:16.971 --> 52:18.406
Jett.

52:22.642 --> 52:25.812
Motherfucker.
Come on. Let's go.

52:53.374 --> 52:55.309
Sleep well.

52:58.745 --> 53:00.314
Damn, Bea. Warn a bitch!

53:02.715 --> 53:03.918
Where's Lily?

53:05.685 --> 53:06.954
Joey, n...

53:11.358 --> 53:12.592
Lily!

53:18.365 --> 53:20.600
I'm sorry about this.

53:22.836 --> 53:23.938
Lily! Okay.

53:32.846 --> 53:35.116
Go, go, go, go!

53:38.852 --> 53:40.653
Did you check the statewide
banner like I asked?

53:40.787 --> 53:43.124
Yeah. No sign of what
you told me to look for.

53:43.257 --> 53:44.258
Sure?

53:44.391 --> 53:47.194
Yeah, only three crimes
have been reported

53:47.328 --> 53:49.696
for female perpetrators
in the last two hours.

53:49.829 --> 53:53.800
Uh, however, no signs
of "groups of women

53:53.934 --> 53:57.171
committing revenge crimes
in a big group."

53:58.939 --> 54:00.840
You wrote "group" twice.

54:03.144 --> 54:04.612
Which is fine.

54:04.744 --> 54:07.814
<i>Reports of
an explosion in 2236 Connor Drive.</i>

54:07.948 --> 54:10.850
<i>A group of women reportedly
fleeing the scene in a truck</i>

54:10.985 --> 54:12.153
<i>in a big group.</i>

54:12.286 --> 54:14.922
That's half a mile
from here.

54:17.158 --> 54:19.059
I haven't worn a dress
in a minute.

54:20.894 --> 54:23.796
- I kinda like it.
- Yeah?

54:23.931 --> 54:26.699
I mean, I've never had a reason to
wear something like this, but...

54:26.833 --> 54:29.003
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

54:37.478 --> 54:38.979
Thank you.

54:52.026 --> 54:54.761
- <i>There was an explosion reported...</i>
- You see this shit?

54:54.894 --> 54:56.230
...at the Pi Iota house.

54:56.363 --> 54:58.432
Many students are claiming
that karma is responsible

54:58.566 --> 54:59.699
for the blaze.

54:59.832 --> 55:01.936
However, arson is believed
to be at play.

55:02.069 --> 55:03.703
So the question remains:

55:03.836 --> 55:06.473
What does the face of karma
actually look like?

55:06.607 --> 55:07.740
- Nice.
- Yeah.

55:07.874 --> 55:09.043
Hey, Sal.

55:09.176 --> 55:10.743
And let's not forget
that I almost lost

55:10.877 --> 55:12.913
a fucking hand
getting some of that intel.

55:13.047 --> 55:16.849
No, I know that, and you know I
don't give a fuck about the money.

55:23.924 --> 55:26.527
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

55:26.660 --> 55:28.062
That's it.

55:32.399 --> 55:33.434
Come here.

55:39.573 --> 55:41.408
Yeah, good work.

55:41.542 --> 55:44.877
But we need to keep goin'.
We need to get to Cuzzo's joint. Come on.

56:08.636 --> 56:11.338
Jesus fucking Christ!

56:21.881 --> 56:22.882
<i>Hello.</i>

56:23.017 --> 56:25.419
Hi, is this Mark Vanderhill?

56:26.687 --> 56:28.088
Who's this?

56:28.222 --> 56:30.257
This is
Sheriff Vernon Oakwood.

56:31.392 --> 56:32.993
Oh. Right, well,
that's not uncommon.

56:33.127 --> 56:35.828
Can I ask what you think
that has to do with me?

56:35.963 --> 56:38.865
Okay. Well, look,
I understand you know her,

56:38.999 --> 56:40.267
but you clearly don't know me!

56:40.401 --> 56:42.303
'Cause if you knew
anything about me,

56:42.436 --> 56:44.871
you'd know that I don't cancel
events for activist fuck-rags.

56:45.005 --> 56:46.640
Let me explain
something to you.

56:46.774 --> 56:49.643
I can't cancel an event just
because a woman has it out for me.

56:49.777 --> 56:51.445
Okay?
Do you know who I am?

56:51.578 --> 56:54.415
Do you have any fuckin' idea how
many women have it out for me?

56:54.548 --> 56:56.816
<i>So, listen, tell your friend,
who you know so well,</i>

56:56.950 --> 57:00.020
that if she wants to come and
learn the necessities of dominance,

57:00.154 --> 57:02.122
I'd be happy to teach her.

57:02.956 --> 57:04.391
Hello?

57:12.366 --> 57:13.400
Morill!

57:23.843 --> 57:25.679
That was
an out-of-town sheriff

57:25.813 --> 57:29.650
sayin' there's some feminists
who want to attack my event.

57:30.918 --> 57:35.055
I'd like you to be there.
I need additional protection.

57:35.189 --> 57:38.158
Not just
fuckin' Alistair.

57:50.003 --> 57:52.373
Phone call must have
really spooked you, huh?

57:52.506 --> 57:54.441
Do I need to remind you
that the whole reason

57:54.575 --> 57:56.643
why your operation
is even functional

57:56.777 --> 57:58.379
is because
I told the mayor...

57:58.512 --> 57:59.680
Officer Grumm,

57:59.813 --> 58:02.916
take that bitch to the boat
before she dies out here.

58:03.050 --> 58:04.118
Yes, Chief.

58:04.251 --> 58:05.519
Let the boys know
they can take off

58:05.652 --> 58:07.054
once you get her
on board.

58:07.187 --> 58:09.823
Then take this bitch
to his circle jerk.

58:09.957 --> 58:11.392
It's not a circle jerk,
all right?

58:11.525 --> 58:13.893
It's a very important
Men's First meeting.

58:14.027 --> 58:16.497
I expected more unity
from my brothers, okay?

58:16.630 --> 58:17.664
Men First!

58:19.400 --> 58:21.001
Redneck.

58:59.139 --> 59:00.240
I don't see him.

59:00.374 --> 59:02.443
Hold on. Hold on there.

59:23.030 --> 59:24.264
What y'all doin' here?

59:24.398 --> 59:26.633
We're here to see Cuzzo.

01:00:06.607 --> 01:00:08.308
Well, well, well!

01:00:09.243 --> 01:00:11.044
The Mad Maxines
find themselves in need

01:00:11.178 --> 01:00:13.013
of a little help
from their friends.

01:00:13.146 --> 01:00:15.616
Well, you know,
we must really be in trouble

01:00:15.749 --> 01:00:18.552
if the only help we can get
is from the Little Rascals.

01:00:18.685 --> 01:00:21.221
Always talkin' shit.
How're you, Sal?

01:00:21.355 --> 01:00:22.689
Lily's hurt.

01:00:22.823 --> 01:00:25.259
Boys, show our guest where
the medical supplies are.

01:00:25.392 --> 01:00:27.094
Hi, I'm Joey.

01:00:27.227 --> 01:00:28.930
Anthony.
They call me "Cuzzo."

01:00:29.062 --> 01:00:30.230
- Cool.
- Nice to meet you.

01:00:30.364 --> 01:00:31.665
Nice to meet you.

01:00:31.798 --> 01:00:34.234
Um, do you all live here?

01:00:34.368 --> 01:00:35.769
About two years now.

01:00:35.903 --> 01:00:38.006
After the floods came,
this whole area was abandoned.

01:00:38.138 --> 01:00:39.573
We've been here
ever since.

01:00:40.274 --> 01:00:44.111
Uh, who takes care
of you guys?

01:00:45.412 --> 01:00:47.080
- What?
- Don't let age fool you.

01:00:47.214 --> 01:00:49.616
<i>These are capable,
smart boys.</i>

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.118
<i>We grow our own food.</i>

01:00:51.251 --> 01:00:53.587
<i>We make money
salvagin' materials and such.</i>

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.124
<i>I learned how to survive for
five years from Sal and Fala.</i>

01:00:57.257 --> 01:00:59.826
- Hmm.
- I gotta say I'm impressed.

01:00:59.961 --> 01:01:01.094
I am.

01:01:01.228 --> 01:01:02.829
It's a lot better
than a group home.

01:01:02.964 --> 01:01:04.631
Yeah, that's the idea.

01:01:04.765 --> 01:01:05.866
Yo, fellas!

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.069
Let's get the table ready
for dinner tonight.

01:01:09.202 --> 01:01:11.872
I came up with the queer
pop all-star squad.

01:01:12.006 --> 01:01:13.607
Oh, my God.
You're obsessed.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.711
Ellen Ripley,
Sarah Connor, Clarice,

01:01:17.844 --> 01:01:21.448
all the Disney villains... Ursula, Jafar, all of them.

01:01:21.582 --> 01:01:24.818
Gandalf, Sherlock Holmes
and Harriet the Spy.

01:01:24.953 --> 01:01:27.989
Don't forget Curious George and the
little white children of Narnia.

01:01:28.121 --> 01:01:30.390
Oh, my God!

01:01:30.857 --> 01:01:31.960
Hey.

01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:34.127
Um, my friend thinks
you're pretty.

01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:36.730
Aw!

01:01:38.465 --> 01:01:40.901
You're gonna give those boys
a heart attack.

01:01:41.568 --> 01:01:43.370
Fellas, pull up!

01:01:43.503 --> 01:01:45.372
So may you
eat well tonight,

01:01:45.505 --> 01:01:49.810
and if you do ever need us,
we'll be there for you.

01:01:49.944 --> 01:01:51.411
Now let's eat!

01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:05.652
He knows about Littleson.

01:03:05.786 --> 01:03:07.554
<i>He seems concerned,
even for him.</i>

01:03:07.688 --> 01:03:11.725
It's possible we may have
underestimated the situation.

01:03:18.398 --> 01:03:20.200
Vernon knows
where we're going.

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:22.602
- Who's Vernon?
- He's a cop.

01:03:24.172 --> 01:03:25.806
Why are we going
to Littleson?

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.408
'Cause that's where
Sal's goin'.

01:03:28.976 --> 01:03:30.210
Who's Sal?

01:03:31.211 --> 01:03:32.947
Who's Sal?

01:03:34.781 --> 01:03:36.516
I'm gonna
tell you something,

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:38.351
- but I don't wanna hear another word about it, okay?
- Yeah.

01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:41.923
I was graduatin'.
I was gettin' ready to go to the academy.

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:47.627
She'd already graduated.
She was so fuckin' smart.

01:03:49.362 --> 01:03:51.732
And we had a thing.

01:03:51.865 --> 01:03:56.336
He was very charming,
and he was very handsome,

01:03:56.470 --> 01:04:00.373
and, shit,
I grew quite fond of him.

01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:02.676
<i>And so I asked her to marry me.</i>

01:04:03.543 --> 01:04:05.545
- Where?
- What?

01:04:06.546 --> 01:04:08.749
Where did you ask her
to marry you?

01:04:10.684 --> 01:04:13.286
On a Ferris wheel.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:15.355
That's romantic.

01:04:19.426 --> 01:04:21.461
I said yes, like an idiot.

01:04:21.595 --> 01:04:24.232
I had no fucking clue
what I wanted.

01:04:24.364 --> 01:04:25.899
You were in love.

01:04:26.767 --> 01:04:27.501
Yeah.

01:04:27.634 --> 01:04:30.470
Well... I got pregnant.

01:04:30.604 --> 01:04:33.340
He was thrilled.
I was not.

01:04:33.473 --> 01:04:35.842
We fought about it.

01:04:35.977 --> 01:04:38.812
I did what I had to do.

01:04:38.946 --> 01:04:44.718
He went and told my family,
who promptly disowned me.

01:04:45.485 --> 01:04:47.487
We never did get married.

01:04:47.621 --> 01:04:49.957
I met Fala instead.

01:04:50.091 --> 01:04:52.059
- You still love her, don't you?
- Don't...

01:04:52.193 --> 01:04:54.728
- What?
- Don't. You're gonna give me advice.

01:04:54.861 --> 01:04:56.596
- Just don't.
- Sure. Sure. I get it.

01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:58.665
Lockin' it up. It's...

01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:03.770
- Just one thing, though. I...
- Nope, nope.

01:05:05.206 --> 01:05:08.675
I could say this doesn't
matter, but it does.

01:05:10.443 --> 01:05:13.680
Now, if any of you
wanna quit...

01:05:15.382 --> 01:05:17.484
now would be the time
to talk.

01:05:27.195 --> 01:05:28.695
All right.

01:05:55.622 --> 01:05:58.025
I hope my nana's okay.

01:06:20.081 --> 01:06:24.018
I am so excited
to see you all here tonight!

01:06:24.151 --> 01:06:25.585
Whoo!

01:06:25.719 --> 01:06:27.888
- Here's the man we've been waiting for.
- Yeah!

01:06:28.022 --> 01:06:32.159
Gentlemen and gentlemen,
Mr. Mark Vanderhill!

01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:40.400
Men first! Men first!
Men first! Men first!

01:06:40.533 --> 01:06:43.803
Men first! Men first!
Men first! Men first!

01:06:43.938 --> 01:06:47.774
Men first! Men first!
Men first! Men first!

01:06:47.909 --> 01:06:50.844
- Men first! Men first!
- Soldiers. Brothers.

01:06:51.711 --> 01:06:53.613
Okay, so not only
am I very excited to see

01:06:53.747 --> 01:06:55.815
all these familiar faces here,

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:59.519
but I'm also even more thrilled maybe to see
some of the new faces I see out here, right?

01:06:59.653 --> 01:07:01.454
Faces of people who...

01:07:01.588 --> 01:07:03.590
who wanted to be here,

01:07:03.723 --> 01:07:05.725
who wanted to be here,
but were afraid

01:07:05.859 --> 01:07:07.861
to make their faces known!

01:07:07.995 --> 01:07:10.830
I know about that fear.
That's what I wanna talk about today.

01:07:10.965 --> 01:07:13.100
A lot of you might know me
from the Vanderhill Files,

01:07:13.234 --> 01:07:15.069
if we've got any Fanderhills
in the building.

01:07:15.202 --> 01:07:18.505
When I was a young man, I was
actually a very sad, very lonely kid.

01:07:18.638 --> 01:07:21.142
I was rejected,
teased by my peers.

01:07:21.275 --> 01:07:24.011
I was ignored by women who...
You know what they do.

01:07:24.145 --> 01:07:27.781
They say they want one thing,
ultimately maybe they want another thing.

01:07:32.987 --> 01:07:35.089
I was rejected by a culture
that, as I've grown older,

01:07:35.222 --> 01:07:37.358
I've just watched it
become crazier and crazier

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:40.094
and more and more emasculated.

01:07:40.227 --> 01:07:44.631
A culture in which every woman and
minority is a superstar by default.

01:07:45.433 --> 01:07:47.534
<i>Regardless
of their behavior.</i>

01:07:49.036 --> 01:07:51.038
No more insults, right?
No more slurs.

01:07:51.172 --> 01:07:54.774
That's what they say. But somehow,
these certain words are approached

01:07:54.909 --> 01:07:56.676
<i>with more and more anger,
right?</i>

01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:59.246
No slurs, but we've got
these words now, like, uh,

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.182
I don't know...

01:08:02.216 --> 01:08:03.317
Straight?

01:08:03.451 --> 01:08:04.784
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:08:05.819 --> 01:08:07.520
I don't know. White?

01:08:07.654 --> 01:08:09.656
Yeah.

01:08:10.257 --> 01:08:13.493
- <i>Man?</i>
- Yeah!

01:08:15.229 --> 01:08:16.964
<i>Dirty words.</i>

01:08:17.098 --> 01:08:20.100
Now, I don't know if y'all here
are men of religion or science.

01:08:20.234 --> 01:08:22.069
It doesn't matter.

01:08:22.203 --> 01:08:24.104
You and I, we know.

01:08:24.238 --> 01:08:26.240
We are men.

01:08:26.374 --> 01:08:28.109
We're men!

01:08:28.242 --> 01:08:29.910
We're men!

01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:33.779
I'm not gonna be
sorry for that anymore!

01:08:33.913 --> 01:08:36.582
I'm not gonna be sorry
for being white!

01:08:36.716 --> 01:08:39.586
I'm not gonna be sorry
for being straight!

01:08:39.719 --> 01:08:44.492
We brought this civilization
out of chaos.

01:08:44.624 --> 01:08:47.361
We founded this country
on our backs,

01:08:47.495 --> 01:08:49.497
and now, at the 11th hour,

01:08:49.629 --> 01:08:51.064
with the work already done,

01:08:51.198 --> 01:08:53.100
now they want a seat
at the table.

01:08:53.234 --> 01:08:56.770
Now they want us
to give up power willingly

01:08:56.903 --> 01:08:59.538
into the hands of people
who, I'm sorry,

01:08:59.671 --> 01:09:02.276
are incapable of wielding it.

01:09:02.410 --> 01:09:05.678
Well, brothers... brothers, let me say...

01:09:06.346 --> 01:09:09.283
Over my dead body.

01:09:10.817 --> 01:09:13.319
Over my dead body!

01:09:13.453 --> 01:09:17.224
Men first!
Men first! Men first! Men first!

01:09:17.358 --> 01:09:19.393
Men first!

01:09:19.527 --> 01:09:22.729
<i>Hey, y'all fellas. You may notice
the room may be gettin' a bit hazy.</i>

01:09:22.862 --> 01:09:24.031
<i>But don't worry
about your lungs.</i>

01:09:24.165 --> 01:09:26.067
<i>This stuff won't kill you.</i>

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.667
<i>It isolates chromosomes in human
DNA that are meant for reproduction.</i>

01:09:28.801 --> 01:09:30.569
Bobby,
we got a little technical something.

01:09:30.703 --> 01:09:33.474
<i>Making it an effective sterilizing
agent for male primates.</i>

01:09:33.606 --> 01:09:37.243
<i>It shuts down cardio flow to your penis.</i>

01:09:37.377 --> 01:09:41.082
<i>Side effects may include
no more erections ever again.</i>

01:09:46.953 --> 01:09:48.587
What the fuck is that?

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.657
Alistair, Alistair!
What the fuck is that?

01:09:53.725 --> 01:09:56.430
<i>So you don't have to
interact with women anymore.</i>

01:09:56.564 --> 01:09:57.932
<i>Yeah. No more crying.</i>

01:09:58.065 --> 01:10:00.434
- <i>No more makeup.</i>
- <i>No more periods.</i>

01:10:00.568 --> 01:10:01.835
<i>Ew!</i>

01:10:04.704 --> 01:10:07.807
<i>So, remember, boys, be nice.</i>

01:10:19.053 --> 01:10:22.123
Hey, be ready
to fly out of here.

01:10:22.256 --> 01:10:25.059
As soon as Bea shows,
we're gone.

01:10:30.097 --> 01:10:33.134
Yeah, baby!

01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:38.305
There's nothin' I love more
than watching grown men squeal.

01:10:38.439 --> 01:10:39.839
Watch out!

01:10:39.974 --> 01:10:42.143
Come on, Bea, come on!

01:10:42.276 --> 01:10:44.044
- I will fuck you, bitch!
- Come on, Bea!

01:10:44.178 --> 01:10:46.413
- I will fuck you!
- We gotta go!

01:10:52.553 --> 01:10:55.256
You know, sometimes you gotta
stop and smell the flowers.

01:10:56.957 --> 01:10:58.959
Come on, Bea.

01:11:04.365 --> 01:11:05.665
Are you crazy?

01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:08.435
You just sterilized
a room full of men!

01:11:08.569 --> 01:11:10.670
What more do you want?

01:11:11.405 --> 01:11:13.207
I'm talking to you!

01:11:15.576 --> 01:11:17.311
Fuck!

01:11:23.716 --> 01:11:26.053
We don't have time for this!

01:11:28.622 --> 01:11:30.024
Come on! Come on!

01:11:30.157 --> 01:11:33.127
Bea, get in the fucking truck!
Get in the car! Joey, go!

01:11:44.672 --> 01:11:47.141
Are you out of your mind?

01:11:47.274 --> 01:11:50.277
- What is wrong with you?
- We're on the same team. Just drop it!

01:11:50.411 --> 01:11:52.947
- No!
- Bea, you were makin' a play that you didn't tell anyone about.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.516
Oh, of course, you rush to
defend your new friend, Regina.

01:11:55.649 --> 01:11:57.750
- Oh, God!
- Don't worry about how many times I saved

01:11:57.884 --> 01:11:59.420
- your fucking life or anything.
- Shut up!

01:11:59.553 --> 01:12:01.821
- You are such a hypocrite!
- You are out of your league, bitch!

01:12:01.956 --> 01:12:03.991
- Everything I have is because of me.
- So what?

01:12:04.124 --> 01:12:07.394
- You... You were just gonna... You were gonna rape that man?
- It's accountability, okay?

01:12:07.528 --> 01:12:10.164
And no one's gonna give it to
us, so we have to take it.

01:12:10.297 --> 01:12:12.765
- Even if that means playing dirty sometimes.
- It is not the same thing.

01:12:12.899 --> 01:12:15.802
I can tell it's hard for you to
wrap your head around the fact

01:12:15.936 --> 01:12:17.204
that we can't always
talk shit out.

01:12:17.338 --> 01:12:19.907
So sometimes you just
gotta fuck somebody up.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.142
Yo, bro, chill!

01:12:22.276 --> 01:12:24.811
Hey, fuck. Shit.

01:12:26.247 --> 01:12:27.281
Joey!

01:12:27.648 --> 01:12:28.616
Ah, fuck.

01:12:28.748 --> 01:12:30.150
Hey.

01:12:34.887 --> 01:12:38.492
We're exposed out here.
We need to get to Cuzzo's. Come on.

01:12:39.927 --> 01:12:41.962
What are we doing?

01:12:42.829 --> 01:12:44.965
We're doin' what
no one else will.

01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:48.535
And, yo, you're not wrong about Beatrice.
She does fucked-up shit.

01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:51.338
But she comes
from fucked-up shit.

01:12:51.472 --> 01:12:53.140
And I'm glad that
you called her out.

01:12:53.274 --> 01:12:56.310
I'm sick of fuckin'
doin' it myself.

01:13:15.029 --> 01:13:16.863
Ow! Watch it.

01:13:18.831 --> 01:13:20.833
No. I told you.

01:13:20.968 --> 01:13:23.903
It was four Black ones
and, like, an Arab.

01:13:24.038 --> 01:13:27.041
I'm sorry. I'm not sure
I know who you are.

01:13:27.174 --> 01:13:29.842
Vernon Oakwood.
I'm the sheriff of Guthrie.

01:13:29.977 --> 01:13:32.513
Guthrie? You're quite
a ways from home.

01:13:32.646 --> 01:13:35.616
- Just followin' up on a couple of things.
- You're the guy who called me.

01:13:35.749 --> 01:13:37.351
The one who told me
to cancel.

01:13:37.484 --> 01:13:41.422
I heard about that. You seemed
concerned about some vigilantism?

01:13:41.555 --> 01:13:44.824
That's right, I was,
but I don't know.

01:13:45.892 --> 01:13:48.329
You made that call,
and now you're here,

01:13:48.462 --> 01:13:51.198
a moment after
a terrorist attack.

01:13:51.332 --> 01:13:54.201
Why don't you tell us
what you do know?

01:13:55.703 --> 01:13:58.172
- Just followin' a hunch.
- What's her name?

01:13:58.305 --> 01:14:00.808
Doesn't really seem
like her MO.

01:14:00.941 --> 01:14:03.043
People change.

01:14:04.678 --> 01:14:07.847
- Well...
- Don't you worry.

01:14:07.981 --> 01:14:10.317
We take care of our
loose ends around here.

01:14:10.451 --> 01:14:12.252
If she had somethin'
to do with this,

01:14:12.386 --> 01:14:15.622
she's gonna be in a body bag
before sundown.

01:14:18.025 --> 01:14:20.828
I was tracking them through
the surveillance cams.

01:14:20.961 --> 01:14:22.296
Fifty miles from here.

01:14:22.429 --> 01:14:24.465
One cam,
five miles down the road.

01:14:25.532 --> 01:14:28.836
He's fuckin' full of shit.
I want you to arrest him.

01:14:28.969 --> 01:14:30.437
I want you
to arrest him right now.

01:14:30.571 --> 01:14:32.506
Listen, I know you got
some big-shot pride,

01:14:32.639 --> 01:14:36.477
but you raise your voice to me
again, I'll kill you where you stand.

01:14:39.313 --> 01:14:42.483
Get me some traffic footage
from every direction.

01:14:42.616 --> 01:14:44.184
Yes, Chief.

01:15:07.374 --> 01:15:10.444
Been a long couple
of days, huh?

01:15:11.945 --> 01:15:14.314
I'm ready to go home.

01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:18.585
You don't
have to explain.

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:27.961
When I first met Regina,
she was only 12 years old.

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:32.399
She'd already
killed a man.

01:15:34.668 --> 01:15:36.370
At this point,

01:15:36.503 --> 01:15:38.539
Regina is so used
to this life,

01:15:38.672 --> 01:15:42.376
she doesn't even consider if
this is what she wants anymore.

01:15:43.544 --> 01:15:47.981
Asking yourself
what you want,

01:15:48.749 --> 01:15:50.784
listening to that

01:15:50.919 --> 01:15:54.455
and doin'
what is right for you.

01:15:57.357 --> 01:15:59.426
It's what
makes you strong.

01:16:03.797 --> 01:16:06.366
We all understand
betrayal.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:09.870
For some of us,
it was a system.

01:16:10.003 --> 01:16:12.072
Maybe it was
our families.

01:16:12.206 --> 01:16:14.575
Could have been
a stranger.

01:16:17.144 --> 01:16:19.713
Maybe it was
an old friend.

01:16:23.183 --> 01:16:25.419
We all know
why we're here.

01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:45.472
Did I tell you
or didn't I tell you?

01:16:46.406 --> 01:16:48.442
Yeah,
right here somewhere.

01:16:55.482 --> 01:16:58.118
Whoo-hoo! Black attack!
Come on, let's go!

01:16:58.252 --> 01:16:59.720
Boys, move.
Come on, come on.

01:16:59.853 --> 01:17:01.755
- We gotta go. We gotta go.
- Come on. Come on.

01:17:01.889 --> 01:17:04.993
Boys, move! It's time to move!
Let's go! Come on!

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:06.793
Boys, get everythin' together!

01:17:08.128 --> 01:17:09.296
Okay, now listen.

01:17:09.429 --> 01:17:11.064
You stay with the girls
and you get home.

01:17:11.198 --> 01:17:12.332
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:14.401
- You got it?
- All right, all right.

01:17:14.535 --> 01:17:17.538
Come on, come on, come on. Get the bags.
Take this one. Petey, you got your backpack?

01:17:17.671 --> 01:17:20.474
- Move to the front. Come on!
- Get these boys right out of here.

01:17:20.607 --> 01:17:21.708
No matter what.

01:17:39.192 --> 01:17:40.761
What are you doin' here?

01:17:42.162 --> 01:17:44.631
You still look good.

01:17:47.434 --> 01:17:49.770
- You look like hell.
- Yeah.

01:17:49.903 --> 01:17:53.340
I'm in better shape
than you are, though.

01:17:53.473 --> 01:17:56.109
Deranged lunatic Morill's
tryin' to find you.

01:17:56.243 --> 01:17:58.412
You came a long way
for a heads-up.

01:17:59.646 --> 01:18:02.182
You really think that they're
gonna let you walk away from this?

01:18:02.316 --> 01:18:05.452
These guys are
professional murderers, Sal.

01:18:05.586 --> 01:18:07.922
They're comin'
for your blood.

01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:10.857
All right,
let me take you in.

01:18:10.992 --> 01:18:15.796
I'll get you to a... get you a cell,
get you safe. It's better than a morgue.

01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:20.767
My knight in shinin' armor
comin' to save my neck

01:18:20.901 --> 01:18:22.636
by choppin' off my head.

01:18:22.769 --> 01:18:24.871
You can hate me all you want,
all right, just...

01:18:25.006 --> 01:18:26.707
Oh, I never hated you,
dummy.

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:29.176
I just wanted you to
ask me how to help

01:18:29.309 --> 01:18:31.645
instead of telling me
how you're gonna do it.

01:18:38.452 --> 01:18:40.420
You really
haven't changed a bit.

01:18:40.554 --> 01:18:42.756
- I can control the situation. Just trust me.
- Hey!

01:18:44.157 --> 01:18:47.361
It's over.

01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:52.033
They're coming!

01:18:52.165 --> 01:18:53.600
How can I help you?

01:18:56.203 --> 01:18:58.238
You still shoot
that pistol?

01:18:59.573 --> 01:19:03.410
Get down on the ground,
or we will kill you!

01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:32.365
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:20:35.302 --> 01:20:37.838
I'm sorry. I know
what she meant to you.

01:20:37.972 --> 01:20:39.006
Yeah.

01:20:41.408 --> 01:20:45.012
You know, I do what I
wanna do no matter what.

01:20:45.146 --> 01:20:48.548
And... it's not always cool.

01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:52.252
I was completely
out of line back there,

01:20:52.385 --> 01:20:54.621
and you were right
to have stopped me.

01:21:10.938 --> 01:21:12.572
What are you gonna do?

01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:16.443
Take the boys
to the Bomb.

01:21:17.277 --> 01:21:19.147
Talk to Fala.

01:21:19.279 --> 01:21:21.515
Figure out
what the next step is.

01:21:23.316 --> 01:21:24.518
Yeah, we'll lead the way.

01:21:24.651 --> 01:21:26.087
No, no,
we can't go back there.

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:28.055
Beatrice, we don't have time
for this, okay?

01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:30.992
- We don't have time for this? What do you...
- Beatrice is right.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.863
Regina, the man that killed
Sal, we gotta take him down.

01:22:01.122 --> 01:22:03.090
War is upon us.

01:22:03.224 --> 01:22:07.061
Today will go down in history
as the beginning of the end

01:22:07.195 --> 01:22:10.998
for those who seek to destroy what
we have worked so hard to build,

01:22:11.132 --> 01:22:14.568
these important and critical
structures of power.

01:22:14.701 --> 01:22:18.605
Now, I'm on my way to convene with
some of my most trusted brothers

01:22:18.738 --> 01:22:21.775
on our best course of action
going forward.

01:22:21.909 --> 01:22:25.745
To my followers,
to my soldiers, know this.

01:22:25.879 --> 01:22:30.650
Victory in this war
will be both bloody and sweet.

01:22:32.019 --> 01:22:35.689
Know that I am personally
coming for you.

01:22:37.091 --> 01:22:38.592
Fuck! Fuck!

01:22:38.725 --> 01:22:41.661
How the fuck
did we let this happen?

01:22:41.795 --> 01:22:43.864
After the chemical weapon
was released,

01:22:43.998 --> 01:22:46.700
we tracked the suspects
to a nearby junkyard

01:22:46.833 --> 01:22:49.536
with our fellow officers
from Guthrie,

01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:51.838
who, I am sad to say,

01:22:53.074 --> 01:22:56.509
have both been shot and killed
by these maniacs.

01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:59.546
We were, however,
successful in taking down

01:22:59.679 --> 01:23:01.048
the terrorist cell.

01:23:01.182 --> 01:23:04.384
All the women responsible
for the attack in Littleson

01:23:04.517 --> 01:23:06.419
have been killed.

01:23:06.553 --> 01:23:08.488
That's all
I can share for now.

01:23:10.091 --> 01:23:12.459
I bet you my boots
they're gonna try to find me.

01:23:12.592 --> 01:23:15.829
So get out to the boat,
make sure everything's still on schedule.

01:24:52.259 --> 01:24:55.695
I think you're gonna find
this was a big mistake.

01:25:05.672 --> 01:25:07.108
I'll be there in an hour.

01:25:07.241 --> 01:25:11.544
I got two more to load up
before the boat heads out.

01:25:15.082 --> 01:25:19.453
You should have stuck
to frat boys and catcallers.

01:25:19.586 --> 01:25:21.855
What are you
gonna do to us?

01:25:23.157 --> 01:25:24.992
Kill you?

01:25:25.126 --> 01:25:26.160
Nah.

01:25:26.293 --> 01:25:29.430
Ten grand a head,
you're worth more alive.

01:25:29.562 --> 01:25:33.833
Might have some fun with you
before I send you packin'.

01:25:35.269 --> 01:25:37.871
Really, you're just
a fucking hired gun.

01:25:41.175 --> 01:25:45.413
Power is defined
by the storyteller.

01:25:45.545 --> 01:25:49.517
If my boat full of women makes
it from San Marco to Mexico,

01:25:49.649 --> 01:25:51.785
I'll be rich.

01:25:51.919 --> 01:25:54.754
That boat gets intercepted,

01:25:55.456 --> 01:25:57.324
I'll be the hero.

01:25:57.458 --> 01:25:59.692
Call me whatever you like.

01:25:59.826 --> 01:26:02.695
Nobody cares
what some Black cunt said.

01:26:02.829 --> 01:26:04.265
They care what I say.

01:26:04.398 --> 01:26:08.269
You see, I can turn
a missing mother of four

01:26:08.402 --> 01:26:12.473
into a dangerous prostitute
who's abandoned her children.

01:26:12.605 --> 01:26:15.875
I can turn the heroin
that I bought

01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:19.146
into the reason why
we shoot up a car full of spics.

01:26:22.983 --> 01:26:25.219
I'm the storyteller!

01:26:27.254 --> 01:26:30.623
I can make you moan
like the whore you are.

01:26:35.396 --> 01:26:37.231
What do you say, Joey?

01:26:37.364 --> 01:26:40.034
Enough
for a conviction?

01:26:41.068 --> 01:26:42.269
Yeah.

01:26:42.403 --> 01:26:44.637
Say cheese,
motherfucker.

01:26:45.672 --> 01:26:47.841
- Get off me!
- Hey!

01:26:47.975 --> 01:26:49.343
Like you said,
they won't believe us,

01:26:49.477 --> 01:26:51.946
but there's no way
they won't believe you.

01:27:14.268 --> 01:27:17.204
Fala said the
video's going crazy on the Net.

01:27:19.706 --> 01:27:21.808
Yo, look at all this shit.
What the fuck?

01:27:21.942 --> 01:27:24.979
These are ID's
of 20 different missing women.

01:27:25.112 --> 01:27:27.114
I like to keep trophies.

01:27:27.248 --> 01:27:29.350
Gettin' your dick wet
is one thing,

01:27:29.483 --> 01:27:33.120
but takin' something from someone
that they don't wanna give you,

01:27:33.254 --> 01:27:35.889
well,
that's really special.

01:27:36.023 --> 01:27:38.025
- What the fuck?
- Joey, don't.

01:27:38.159 --> 01:27:40.327
Someone took it from you,
didn't they?

01:27:40.461 --> 01:27:43.497
I saw that same fear
in your friend's eyes.

01:27:43.631 --> 01:27:46.634
She looked scared
when she died.

01:28:31.645 --> 01:28:33.180
Let's give you
a fair shot.

01:28:44.358 --> 01:28:46.826
You ain't got it no
more, old man.

01:28:47.328 --> 01:28:49.096
Take him down.

01:29:22.663 --> 01:29:24.298
We should go.

01:29:26.667 --> 01:29:28.302
Not me.

01:29:54.928 --> 01:29:56.130
What?

01:29:58.232 --> 01:30:00.267
Come on.
You have to come with us.

01:30:00.734 --> 01:30:01.669
Come on.

01:30:01.801 --> 01:30:03.437
- I can't.
- No, you...

01:30:04.405 --> 01:30:06.373
No, I can't.

01:31:58.252 --> 01:31:59.787
Baby!

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.922
I didn't even know
you were here!

01:32:02.055 --> 01:32:04.124
Mmm. Mmm.

01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:09.830
Oh. Baby, what's wrong?

01:32:09.963 --> 01:32:11.165
Nothin'.

01:32:11.298 --> 01:32:12.966
It's just good
to see you.

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.401
How you feelin'?

01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:17.404
Better.

01:32:24.611 --> 01:32:26.713
- Pop.
- Hey.

01:32:27.481 --> 01:32:28.949
Hey, you know somethin'?

01:32:29.082 --> 01:32:31.452
I walked two miles every day
while you were gone.

01:32:31.585 --> 01:32:33.587
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. Two.

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:36.023
I got some
of this brown sugar butter.

01:32:36.156 --> 01:32:37.324
You're gonna love it.

01:32:37.458 --> 01:32:39.059
After breakfast,
we can walk to the store.

01:32:39.193 --> 01:32:42.162
You won't believe how they've
changed some of the stuff.

01:32:42.296 --> 01:32:44.298
Oh, and some of the people...

01:33:32.012 --> 01:33:33.247
Joey.

01:33:34.414 --> 01:33:36.783
- Can I come in?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

01:33:39.486 --> 01:33:42.256
Uh, can I get you
somethin' to drink?

01:33:46.126 --> 01:33:49.696
It's good to see you, Joey.
I've been, uh... I've been meaning to...

01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:51.565
to call you.

01:33:57.804 --> 01:34:01.009
What'd you wanna
talk to me about?

01:34:01.141 --> 01:34:03.677
Nothing. I just wanted
to let you know

01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:06.880
that I was gonna be pretty busy
the next few weeks.

01:34:07.015 --> 01:34:08.582
It's gonna be hard
to hang out.

01:34:08.715 --> 01:34:11.818
Oh, you thought I wanted
to hang with you again?

01:34:11.953 --> 01:34:13.587
No, I was not assuming that.

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.522
I just... I just wanted
to... to touch base.

01:34:15.656 --> 01:34:18.592
Oh, relax.
That's not why I'm here.

01:34:19.693 --> 01:34:21.428
All right. Um...

01:34:23.564 --> 01:34:25.165
What's...

01:34:25.299 --> 01:34:27.134
What's goin' on?

01:34:29.971 --> 01:34:32.907
I've just been thinking
about the last time we hung out.

01:34:33.041 --> 01:34:38.178
You know, the details,
they're, uh, a little foggy.

01:34:40.213 --> 01:34:42.849
Yeah? Uh, which part?

01:34:47.154 --> 01:34:49.856
Well, I remember
getting to the party.

01:34:52.526 --> 01:34:56.363
I remember hanging out
and laughing.

01:34:59.199 --> 01:35:02.669
I remember you were
being so sweet and...

01:35:04.137 --> 01:35:06.873
...encouraging.

01:35:07.008 --> 01:35:09.543
- And then, I don't know, that's when...
- You know what, Joey?

01:35:09.676 --> 01:35:13.780
I have a phone call
for a big interview

01:35:13.915 --> 01:35:15.349
that I really wanna get.

01:35:15.482 --> 01:35:17.851
It's in,
like, five minutes.

01:35:17.986 --> 01:35:20.287
Mike.

01:35:23.557 --> 01:35:25.792
Would you like me to leave?

01:35:30.831 --> 01:35:32.899
What if I said no?

01:35:37.105 --> 01:35:42.676
What would you do
if I said no?

01:35:55.856 --> 01:35:58.825
Oh, come on, you did it.
You can say it.

01:36:02.130 --> 01:36:03.864
I raped you.

01:36:11.139 --> 01:36:12.873
You raped me.

01:36:18.812 --> 01:36:21.782
<i>Did you think
if you never admitted it</i>

01:36:21.916 --> 01:36:24.484
<i>that it never happened?</i>

01:36:24.618 --> 01:36:26.353
<i>That if you left it
out of your story,</i>

01:36:26.486 --> 01:36:28.422
<i>it would be erased from mine?</i>

01:36:29.690 --> 01:36:32.359
<i>Silencin' the truth
doesn't mean it isn't there.</i>

01:36:33.694 --> 01:36:35.529
<i>Doesn't mean it goes away.</i>

01:36:36.863 --> 01:36:40.333
<i>And it doesn't let you
off the hook for what you did.</i>

01:36:41.002 --> 01:36:43.503
<i>You raped me, Mike.</i>

01:36:47.909 --> 01:36:50.544
<i>But you don't get
to tell my story.</i>

01:36:54.115 --> 01:36:55.515
<i>I do.</i>

01:36:56.683 --> 01:36:59.352
<i>So I'm gonna tell it right.</i>

01:37:18.271 --> 01:37:20.007
And don't forget.

01:37:21.341 --> 01:37:23.376
I will be watching.

01:37:26.346 --> 01:37:28.448
So be good now.

01:38:29.911 --> 01:38:31.645
- Speaking of the news...
- Yes. Oh, my God, those girls in the...

01:38:31.778 --> 01:38:33.547
I've been following this on
the news since the beginning.

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:35.348
I'm just gonna
start talking,

01:38:35.482 --> 01:38:38.085
'cause I don't really
know where to start.

01:38:38.219 --> 01:38:41.289
What those ladies did
was absolutely acceptable.

01:38:41.421 --> 01:38:44.491
Honestly, I don't feel bad for
a second for what happened.

01:38:44.624 --> 01:38:50.397
We live experiencing violence
all the fucking time.

01:38:51.299 --> 01:38:52.465
And nobody cares.

01:38:59.739 --> 01:39:03.110
And I'm so glad that these girls are
finally doing something about it.

01:39:03.244 --> 01:39:04.744
As a survivor
of sexual assault,

01:39:04.878 --> 01:39:07.215
I've been told my whole life
that I can't be angry.

01:39:07.347 --> 01:39:09.050
You're gonna sit back
and take it?

01:39:09.183 --> 01:39:10.350
There's
no accountability.

01:39:10.483 --> 01:39:11.986
The system has yet
to protect me.

01:39:12.119 --> 01:39:14.688
The system has yet to do anything
about what happened to me.

01:39:14.821 --> 01:39:16.224
Those girls in that town,
they were like...

01:39:16.356 --> 01:39:17.490
They finally
did something about it.

01:39:22.296 --> 01:39:23.563
Taking the law
into their own hands.

01:39:24.932 --> 01:39:26.700
Gives me permission
to feel everything

01:39:26.833 --> 01:39:29.203
that up until now I've
been told I shouldn't feel.

01:39:29.337 --> 01:39:30.637
So they destroyed
a little property.

01:39:30.770 --> 01:39:32.539
Wait, but where do I sign up
to join the girl game?

01:39:32.672 --> 01:39:34.041
Women are standing up
for themselves.

01:39:34.175 --> 01:39:36.509
- Is that worse than what the boys were doing?
- Nope.

01:39:36.643 --> 01:39:39.646
Passive resistance
is no longer an option.

01:39:39.779 --> 01:39:41.681
And the death of that
sheriff means that things

01:39:41.815 --> 01:39:42.950
are actually
gonna change.

01:39:43.084 --> 01:39:45.619
- We have had enough.
- Yeah, we had enough.

01:39:45.752 --> 01:39:49.156
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- Fuck men, yeah!

01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:51.691
I'm just fuckin' thrilled that
there's a whole new generation

01:39:51.825 --> 01:39:52.994
of badass women
out there.

01:39:53.127 --> 01:39:54.694
Those fuckers got
what they deserved.

01:39:54.828 --> 01:39:57.864
This time,
you're paying the price.

01:39:57.999 --> 01:40:00.533
It's inspiring that people
are standing up finally.

01:40:00.667 --> 01:40:03.104
- Yeah.
- Hopefully it will lead to some sort of change.

01:40:03.237 --> 01:40:05.805
Those cocksuckers
deserved it.
