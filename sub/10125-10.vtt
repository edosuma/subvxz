YOU SAY ONE SENTENCE
TO ME OR MY DATE,

08:35.934 --> 08:39.200
IT BETTER BE,
"HELP, I'M FLYING OUT
THE CAB WINDOW."

08:39.200 --> 08:40.233
DON'T WORRY.

08:40.233 --> 08:42.400
I'M NOT GOING
TO DO ANYTHING STUPID.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.200
HOW COULD YOU
DO SOMETHING
SO STUPID?

08:45.200 --> 08:47.233
YOU SENT AWAY
THE LAST CAB!

08:47.233 --> 08:48.967
THERE WAS
SOMETHING WEIRD

08:48.967 --> 08:50.200
ABOUT THAT DRIVER.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.133
DIDN'T YOU SEE
HIS LICENSE?

08:52.133 --> 08:53.300
IT WASN'T
HIS PICTURE.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.934
IF STUPIDITY
WAS IN THE OLYMPICS,

08:55.934 --> 08:58.734
YOU'D WIN A NOBEL PRIZE!

08:58.734 --> 09:00.066
HE WAS AN IMPOSTOR.

09:00.066 --> 09:02.200
HE COULD'VE TAKEN US
TO SOMEWHERE

09:02.200 --> 09:04.033
AND CUT OUT
OUR LIVERS.

09:04.033 --> 09:07.033
NO BIGGIE.
I'VE ALREADY
HAD MINE OUT.

09:07.033 --> 09:09.400
REBECCA-ALEXA,
I APOLOGIZE

09:09.400 --> 09:10.700
FOR ALL
THE STUPIDITY

09:10.700 --> 09:13.400
THAT RUNS
IN THIS FAMILY.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.567
I'M JUST A CARRIER.

09:14.567 --> 09:16.000
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.800
I DON'T NEED TO GO
TO A CROWDED PARTY
WITH EVERYONE STARING.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.700
OH, WE'RE GOING, BABY.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.867
HEY! LIGHT BULB.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.567
WHY NOT HAVE
OUR OWN PARTY HERE?

09:26.567 --> 09:27.567
IT'LL BE FUN.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.400
MAKING POPCORN,
WATCHING THE BALL DROP--

09:30.400 --> 09:31.867
CORY, MAKE IT STOP.

09:31.867 --> 09:35.834
WE ARE GOING TO
BE SEEN AT THAT PARTY.

09:35.834 --> 09:38.767
HOW? WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO,

09:38.767 --> 09:40.100
TAKE THE SUBWAY?

09:40.100 --> 09:41.700
GREAT IDEA, REBECCA.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.867
I WASN'T
BEING SERIOUS.

09:43.867 --> 09:46.500
THEN YOU LUCKED OUT.
THIS IS FUN.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.400

SO EXCITING
ABOUT DOING THINGS
