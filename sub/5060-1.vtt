00:14.182 --> 00:15.949
(THUNDER CRACKS)

00:38.472 --> 00:39.840
Thank you.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.321
How long is she
gonna be there?

00:53.387 --> 00:57.791
Well, the wife's mother,
she's taking longer
to die than we thought.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.527
You said she never liked you.

00:59.593 --> 01:03.331
No. I said she thought
I was the wrong guy.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.132
Boy, that's good coffee.

01:05.199 --> 01:09.503
Maybe not quite as
good as a macchiato
after carbonara at Adriano's.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.006
But that's
certainly good coffee
for fast food coffee.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.042
What's the name of
this place again?

01:15.109 --> 01:18.746
Franco's.
Franco's.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.615
I didn't think
the state homicide commander
did stakeouts.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.016
It's not a stakeout.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.352
Feels like a stakeout.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.653
No, I just want
to see how long

01:25.719 --> 01:27.255
this guy's gonna
stay in there.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.589
Because?

01:28.656 --> 01:32.193
Because I didn't think
he'd stay in there this long.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.928
Franco's had pizza.
Should I go back?

01:36.230 --> 01:37.765
I told you we had
to make a stop.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.333
You did.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.269
We'll have dinner
at Adriano's.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.703
Tonight?

01:44.071 --> 01:46.006
Tonight. Okay?

01:46.073 --> 01:47.775
(GUN FIRING)

03:18.932 --> 03:20.801
We've managed
to stabilize him.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.405
If he makes it,
we'll have to open him up
again when he's stronger.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.106
That's all we know.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.475
You're a member of
Mr. Healy's immediate family?

04:01.542 --> 04:04.912
It's Captain Healy.
And no, I'm not.
His wife is in Seattle.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.781
Someone has to sign
for his valuables.
His badge. His gun.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.016
I'll take them.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.351
You're a fellow officer?

04:10.418 --> 04:11.452
Yes.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.686
Could I see your badge?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.388
It's in a drawer.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.957
You were with him?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.360
Yes.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.362
That his blood on you?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.031
Some of it.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.068
I'll get them.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.875
JESSE: Good morning.

05:09.176 --> 05:12.212
She's interviewing
the candidate, Lou.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.214
I'm Jesse.
I know.

05:14.281 --> 05:17.451
If you keep
calling me Lou, Suitcase,
I'm going to call you Luther.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.953
Why would I call
you Lou, Jesse?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.024
Sorry I'm late.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.192
Chief Stone!
William Butler.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.361
Nice to meet you.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.229
Rose, I didn't
mean to interrupt.

05:29.296 --> 05:32.466
Yeah, we were up
to the Boston PD
which you left in...

05:32.533 --> 05:34.301
May, 2002.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.571
At which point
I moved to Springfield
and joined the force there.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.708
I was the CJIS liaison
to the staties.

05:40.774 --> 05:44.344
What is CJIS liaison
to the staties?

05:44.412 --> 05:47.347
Criminal Justice
Information Services.
Computers?

05:47.415 --> 05:49.550
Yes, but I want to get back
to hands-on policing.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.819
Well, we're hands-on here.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.123
I guess that's all,
unless you have anything,
Jesse.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.960
I do. Did you leave
your last two jobs
or were you let go?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.296
I beg your pardon?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.698
You didn't hear me?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.736
I heard you. I left.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.639
Thank you very much,
Mr. Butler.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.173
It was a pleasure.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.075
We'll let you know.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.549
Where were you?

06:21.615 --> 06:22.916
I got stuck in traffic.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.151
From your house?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.819
No, from Boston.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.090
What did you think?
Well, he has a very
impressive resume.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.359
I don't like him.
Why not?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.327
He's over-qualified.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.497
Well, so were you.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.199
Jesse, Carter Hansen
wants to see you
over at City Hall.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.434
Did he say why?

06:40.501 --> 06:42.235
No. My sense is
that it's urgent.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.284
HANSEN: Any comment?

06:57.350 --> 06:58.986
They misspelled Healy.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.221
Well, they got
your name right.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.423
Another shooting incident.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.394
What were you doing there?

07:07.461 --> 07:08.729
Talking to a friend.

07:08.796 --> 07:11.499
Did this stakeout have
anything to do with Paradise?

07:11.565 --> 07:12.666
It wasn't a stakeout.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.669
Did it have anything
to do with this town?

07:16.269 --> 07:17.270
No.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.806
You were moonlighting.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.708
Actually I was
drinking coffee.

07:20.774 --> 07:24.377
When the Town
Council hired you,
we made it clear

07:24.444 --> 07:25.979
that the Paradise
Chief of Police

07:26.046 --> 07:28.215
does not have
a 9:00 to 5:00 job.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.382
I know that.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.085
And with the departure
of Officer D'Angelo,

07:32.152 --> 07:35.022
it's more important than ever
for you to be here.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.357
To show the flag,
so to speak.

07:42.796 --> 07:47.367
So how did the interview
go this morning?

07:47.434 --> 07:48.602
What interview?

07:48.669 --> 07:51.772
The candidate seems
highly qualified.

07:51.839 --> 07:55.075
I don't think hiring
your son-in-law is
a good idea.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.611
Strike that.

07:57.678 --> 08:02.249
For the record,
Paradise promotes
tourism, not crime.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.451
Crime is bad
for business.

08:04.518 --> 08:07.087
And some of your exploits
garner headlines

08:07.154 --> 08:09.289
that we don't need
and we don't appreciate.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.793
I see it as my job not
to look the other way.

08:12.860 --> 08:16.730
Well, I've called a meeting
of the full council
for 10:00 tomorrow morning.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.132
Good for you.
We can fire you.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.335
You can. But you can't
tell me what to do.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.952
Mrs. Healy called.
She just got back.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.621
She said, "Thanks
for saving his life."

08:41.688 --> 08:43.957
She told me what happened.
Why didn't you?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.326
Old habit. Who's that?

08:46.393 --> 08:49.897
I don't know.
No one tells me
anything around here.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.364
Jesse.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.603
Why don't you
come in, Suit?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.437
Can I?
You can.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.045
ROSE: Jesse, this is
Elizabeth Blue.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.480
Her baby was kidnapped
a few years ago.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.350
She thinks he might
be in Paradise.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.785
Where was the
baby kidnapped?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.086
Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

09:13.153 --> 09:17.891
Little Boy Blue.
It was all over the news.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.227
That was quite
a while ago, wasn't it?

09:20.293 --> 09:23.463
December 28, 2000.
Seven years.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.099
Wasn't the body recovered?

09:26.166 --> 09:27.768
You know this case?

09:27.835 --> 09:29.102
Know of.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.872
That wasn't my baby.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.406
I thought the body
was identified.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.208
My husband...

09:37.377 --> 09:41.682
A baby's body was
found in a dry river bed
near the Mexican border.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.885
It had the
hospital wristband on it.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.553
But it was...

09:47.287 --> 09:48.822
Decomposed.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.126
My husband had
the remains buried.

09:53.193 --> 09:56.063
He didn't think that I was
strong enough to see it.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.866
And you think
your son is alive
and here in Paradise.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.000
I know it.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.635
You got a feeling?

10:01.702 --> 10:05.305
Why do you think
he's here, Elizabeth?

10:05.372 --> 10:07.407
I received
an anonymous letter.

10:07.474 --> 10:11.779
It said,
"Your child is loved."

10:13.881 --> 10:16.183
And it was
postmarked Paradise.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.687
Did you get any
other letters?

10:21.588 --> 10:23.757
Yes.
From other places?

10:23.824 --> 10:25.358
Yes.
How many?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.428
Hundreds.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.131
LUTHER: So why Paradise?

10:32.532 --> 10:34.702
Because this one haunts me.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.872
"Your child is loved."

10:41.241 --> 10:43.276
I just want my son back.

10:47.347 --> 10:51.719
Mrs. Blue,
anybody could have
written that letter.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.755
You are looking at the entire
Paradise Police force.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.623
A letter like that...

10:59.426 --> 11:03.063
I don't think
there's anything
we can do to help you.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.532
I'm sorry.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.914
I have to get back to
Boston in the morning.

11:20.981 --> 11:24.785
I have to be in
Albuquerque for work
and I can't miss my bus.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.694
(GUNS FIRING)

11:49.376 --> 11:51.644
If you have to use that,
you're going to
have problems.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.781
BOTH: The safety's on
the wrong side.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.049
You could install
an ambidextrous safety.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.685
I don't like them.
They break too easily.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.420
Too much torque.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.391
You're doing
a lot better, Rose.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.995
That one would
have definitely ruined
someone's evening.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.972
When were you planning
on telling me you were shot?

12:19.039 --> 12:21.074
Clearly, I didn't need to.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.912
Why do I get the feeling
that's only one shoe?

12:24.978 --> 12:28.081
You're not even going
to try to look for
that woman's baby?

12:28.148 --> 12:30.350
This is a small town.
How hard can it be?

12:30.417 --> 12:34.154
That kidnapping was
all over the news, Rose.
This is a small town.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.189
Exactly.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.292
Someone would have noticed
a new baby without
a pregnancy, Rose.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.994
Maybe they didn't
move here until later.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.363
Just so they could send
an incriminating letter?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.866
Who's they and how
do you find them?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.234
I don't know.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.969
What do you think, Suit?

12:49.036 --> 12:51.905
What do I think or
what do I feel, Lou?

12:51.972 --> 12:53.340
Either one.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.544
I feel the baby's dead.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.212
ROSE: Jesse, where are you?

14:05.278 --> 14:07.480
He's been sitting
here for half an hour.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.650
I guess I'll start
the interview without you.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.521
You need to get
a cell phone.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.558
Jesse, it's Jenn.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.127
(PHONE RINGS)

14:20.193 --> 14:21.962
I need you to
call me tonight.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.331
It's about Elliot.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.934
I was hoping to
talk to you. I...

14:28.301 --> 14:30.503
Hello.
JENN: Hello, Jesse.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.905
Hello, Jenn.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.406
How are you?

14:33.473 --> 14:34.541
Fine.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.209
Are you alone?

14:36.276 --> 14:38.645
No. I'm talking
with you, Jenn.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.848
Are you drinking?

14:41.915 --> 14:44.584
I'm having my first
of two Scotches.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.220
Jesse, why do you drink
when you're alone?

14:47.287 --> 14:49.189
You sound like
your psychiatrist.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.059
He's your psychiatrist, Jesse.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.161
Okay.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.997
Jesse,
I still care about you.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.533
It's about Elliot.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.936
He wants me to
move in with him.

15:04.671 --> 15:05.805
Okay.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.442
How do you feel about that?

15:09.509 --> 15:12.112
How do I feel about that?

15:12.179 --> 15:14.014
It would be unethical.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.448
What are you talking about?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.884
A Hollywood weather girl
living with her producer.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.053
(PHONE LINE DISCONNECTS)

15:24.157 --> 15:25.425
(SIGHS)

15:32.299 --> 15:34.267
What are you looking at?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.926
So you know who
the shooter was?

16:33.993 --> 16:36.229
Healy couldn't say.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.931
Is he gonna make it?

16:38.998 --> 16:41.868
I don't know.
I'm going in this morning.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.037
Did you hit the guy?

16:44.104 --> 16:47.640
I would say yes,
with my second shot.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.277
It's got to have
something to do
with who he was staking out.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.844
Did he tell you who?

16:51.911 --> 16:53.513
He got evasive.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.748
You know. You were a cop.

16:55.815 --> 16:59.719
Which means it has
something to do with
who he was staking out.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.354
Jenn's moving in
with her producer.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.156
Elliot?

17:04.223 --> 17:05.925
The guy who had
sex with my wife

17:05.992 --> 17:10.297
two days after our
"let's get acquainted
with my new boss" dinner.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.306
So how do you
feel about that?

17:20.607 --> 17:22.709
How do I feel about that?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.444
I don't know.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.913
Maybe you should
ask Suitcase.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.151
He didn't make
Jenn do it, did he?

17:31.218 --> 17:33.320
He's on my list.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.155
What list is that?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.194
Jenn called you
before I started here.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.029
Yeah, she did.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.664
What did she tell you?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.266
I can't tell you that.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.469
What can you tell me?

17:49.536 --> 17:54.474
I can tell you
that two drinks alone
at night is a lousy rule.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.576
It's not a rule.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.010
Exactly.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.915
So did you go in
the tank after she called?

18:03.850 --> 18:05.852
Almost.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.920
So you called me.
Yeah.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.222
Why?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.828
Because I really like you.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.231
Why don't you kiss my ass?

18:23.002 --> 18:24.971
Every time we start to
figure something out,

18:25.037 --> 18:27.974
you make some wiseass remark
or you take a hike on me.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.748
Who kidnaps babies?
What?

18:35.815 --> 18:37.950
I want to know
who kidnaps babies.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.887
It's my time.
I pay you 165 bucks an hour.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.855
180 bucks an hour.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.791
Is this something
we're investigating?

18:45.725 --> 18:48.161
No.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.463
In the old days,
it was people who
couldn't have babies

18:50.530 --> 18:51.898
or lost a baby,

18:51.964 --> 18:55.134
nowadays it's
a service industry.

18:55.202 --> 18:58.838
People steal
babies to sell them.
Or their parts.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.009
Why so early?

19:03.075 --> 19:04.844
I got a Town Council meeting.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.513
They're on your ass.

19:12.819 --> 19:17.857
Well,

tied behind his back.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.459
Suit's on Light Ad actually,

19:19.526 --> 19:23.630
it's one and two people
with one hand tied
behind their back.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.998
You're up to your shorts
in an attempted murder

19:26.065 --> 19:28.134
or murder of
a police officer.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.769
Two police officers.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.439
You fired your weapon.
You're gonna
need a good lawyer.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.040
It's just Internal Affairs.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.510
Exactly. You're gonna
need a good lawyer.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.914
Did you get
shot in the arm?

19:42.582 --> 19:43.916
Yes.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.352
Did they give you a sling?

19:48.421 --> 19:50.189
Yes.

19:50.257 --> 19:53.560
So you're choosing
not to help yourself
get better.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.295
I sense a parable.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.900
You're lucky. No bone.
Just soft tissue.

20:33.966 --> 20:37.337
Looks like they did
a good job. No infection.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.672
Stitches have
pulled a little bit.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.542
They should be okay
if you're careful.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.943
Shouldn't you have a sling?

20:44.010 --> 20:45.678
I said I didn't need one.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.950
Pediatricians don't
deliver babies.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.719
We attend the birth.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.288
How hard is it to
access birth records, Doc?

20:55.355 --> 20:57.023
Well, in a big city,
you'd need some

20:57.089 --> 20:59.492
sort of court order,
but here...

20:59.559 --> 21:01.894
Why?
No reason.

You made me a hyphenate.

I'm proud of being
a pediatrician, too.

21:26.419 --> 21:29.922
Sorry. I was fighting crime.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.925
Chief Stone,
losing Officer D'Angelo

21:32.992 --> 21:36.095
was a serious blow
to the Paradise
Police Department.

21:36.162 --> 21:40.266
Yeah, and last month,
Officer Gammon
wrote 47 tickets,

21:40.333 --> 21:45.004
Officer D'Angelo
wrote 174 tickets,

21:45.071 --> 21:50.610
Officer Simpson was
on Light Administrative
duties, and you wrote six.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.345
I'm the Police Chief.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.246
D'Angelo was
the Babe Ruth of
parking tickets.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.583
And you drove him out.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.718
I may have.
HANSEN: Why?

21:58.785 --> 22:00.453
I didn't like him.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.757
So how's
Officer Simpson doing?

22:05.892 --> 22:07.694
I'd like to release
him from Light Ad.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.162
No adverse effects
from the coma?

22:10.797 --> 22:11.898
None.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.433
We'll take it
under consideration.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.538

Now, strike that.

22:18.605 --> 22:20.339
No one.
Why not?

22:21.173 --> 22:22.341
I don't think it's ethical.

22:22.409 --> 22:25.177
It brings in
a lot of revenue.

22:25.244 --> 22:27.980
You like movies,
Chief Stone?

22:28.047 --> 22:29.315
Good ones.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.651
Yeah, well we think
you police this town

22:31.718 --> 22:33.920
like a cowboy sheriff
in a bad movie.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.354
We think?

22:37.223 --> 22:39.792
I think you're
making up your own rules.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.797

22:44.864 --> 22:48.568
I would prefer
that you think of me
as a benevolent Gene Hackman.

22:48.635 --> 22:50.603
Boy, that was a good movie.

22:50.670 --> 22:54.607
Well, cinema

22:54.674 --> 22:56.809
Get this, Chief Stone.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.945
We know we can't
fire you without notice.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.947
But we do have
other options.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.915

23:02.982 --> 23:04.951
We could dock your pay.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.125
You changed your mind?

24:53.726 --> 24:55.227
No, I didn't.

You said you got a letter?

This the original envelope?

25:04.370 --> 25:05.905
Yes, Chief Stone.

write you five years later?

25:17.550 --> 25:22.555
As you know,
the press had a field day
with my baby's kidnapping.

25:22.622 --> 25:25.992
"Little Boy Blue"
was just too good a headline.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.162
I think the story
finally disappeared

25:30.229 --> 25:34.601
when a pop singer
went into rehab
for the 14th time.

25:37.503 --> 25:41.974
A cable station did
a fifth anniversary show.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.876
And they asked me
about my son.

25:43.943 --> 25:47.814
And you said
you had a feeling
your son was still alive.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.015
I still do.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.317

Why'd you wait so long
after receiving it?

25:58.891 --> 26:01.093
My husband kept it from me.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.962
He didn't think
I should see it.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.866

about that?

They know where he is.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.887

And if he's not,
he could be any place.
The letter tells us nothing.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.659
It said, "Your child
is loved." "Is loved."

31:00.726 --> 31:03.395
As in, "God loves
all children."

31:03.462 --> 31:05.531
Or as in,
"The writer is crazy."

all this way on hope.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.270

Don't you think we owe her?

31:11.337 --> 31:13.205
What if he lived here
and moved away?

31:13.272 --> 31:17.076
What if he never lived here
but just stopped by
to mail the letter?

31:17.143 --> 31:18.877
What if some
vacationing tourist

31:18.945 --> 31:21.047
decided to send
an encouraging note?

31:21.113 --> 31:24.483
Jesse, I know I'm not
an experienced cop like you.

31:24.550 --> 31:28.687
But what are we doing here
if we won't look
for a little lost boy?

31:28.754 --> 31:30.456
You can only do
what you can do.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.025
But he might be here!
She needs to know
that somebody did

31:33.092 --> 31:35.394
absolutely everything
they could to find him.

31:35.461 --> 31:39.331
I can't justify opening up
a seven-year-old

31:39.398 --> 31:40.899
We have to try!

31:40.967 --> 31:42.068
I won't.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.940
There's nowhere

I can't stop you.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.016
Yes, you can.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.119
But I won't.

Good.

32:06.993 --> 32:09.996
What are you thinking?

32:10.062 --> 32:14.233
I was thinking,
if I ever get kidnapped,
I hope you're on the case.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.079
Could the shooter
have been after you?

32:27.146 --> 32:28.614
No.
Because?

32:28.680 --> 32:30.516
Why go after me
from the driver's side?

32:30.582 --> 32:32.651
Did you discharge
your weapon?

32:32.718 --> 32:33.785
I did.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.454
How many discharges?

32:35.521 --> 32:36.788
Two.

32:36.855 --> 32:39.525
Any shooting incidents
in L.A. Homicide?
Yes.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.260
How many?
One.

32:41.327 --> 32:44.163
Fatality?
Are you asking me
or reading about it?

32:51.937 --> 32:54.440
Chief Stone,
you have been Police Chief

32:54.506 --> 32:56.675
of Paradise for
almost three years.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.010
That's correct.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.212
How many shooting incidents?

33:04.016 --> 33:06.352
Six.
Four.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.620
Twice the sentence
was carried out for me.

33:08.687 --> 33:12.591
"The sentence."
That's an interesting
take on police work.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.760
Four.
Fatalities?

33:14.826 --> 33:15.861
Four.

33:15.927 --> 33:17.663
Rather conspicuous
use of deadly force.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.798
Why use deadly force
if it isn't deadly?

33:19.865 --> 33:21.367
Chief Stone,
you are aware that...

33:21.433 --> 33:23.869
That as a good guy,
I am responsible
for every round

33:23.935 --> 33:25.304
from the moment
it leaves the barrel

33:25.371 --> 33:27.706
until it reaches
its final resting place.

33:30.442 --> 33:34.113
You said you
think you may have hit
the assailant with one shot?

33:34.180 --> 33:35.547
That's correct.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.916
Where did the other
one go, Chief Stone?

33:37.983 --> 33:39.651
Jesse.

33:39.718 --> 33:43.922
Where did the other
one go, Chief Stone?

33:43.989 --> 33:47.826
Into a brick wall.
How long have you
been in Internal Affairs?

33:49.095 --> 33:50.829
Almost three years.

33:50.896 --> 33:54.100
Ever been in the field,
Officer Greenstreet?

33:54.666 --> 33:56.568
Sidney.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.204
You ever been in
the field, Sidney?

33:58.870 --> 34:01.006
I have, Jesse.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.109
You ever shot
anybody, Sidney?

34:03.175 --> 34:04.676
I have. It's...

34:04.743 --> 34:06.112
Disturbing.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.045
Are you married, Sidney?

34:08.114 --> 34:10.916
Divorced. As are you.

34:11.750 --> 34:12.984
Jesse.

34:16.021 --> 34:17.188
Jesse.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.333
COACH: Use your body.
Use your body.

34:30.636 --> 34:31.837
Hello.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.106
And you are?

34:34.172 --> 34:36.442
You don't remember me?

34:36.507 --> 34:39.378
I remember the hat. PPD.

34:39.445 --> 34:42.214
Paradise. I'd like
to speak to Mr. Fish.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.417
Mr. Fish is not in.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.219
Alan...

34:48.286 --> 34:49.420
You remember me.

34:49.487 --> 34:52.023
Alan, he's right over there.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.092
Mr. Fish is not in.

34:55.161 --> 34:58.364
If Mr. Fish were in,
I think I'd know about it.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.400
Jesse Stone.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.703
Mr. Fish is in.

35:15.080 --> 35:18.083
I had nothing to do
with shooting Captain Healy.

35:18.150 --> 35:22.421
Actually, I was hoping
you could help me acquire
some methamphetamines.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.556
I read about it
in the paper.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.958
Shooting cops is
bad for business?

35:27.025 --> 35:28.327
Exactly.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.230
You hear things.

35:31.297 --> 35:34.400
Well, I hear
lots of things.
Why would I tell you?

35:34.466 --> 35:36.235
Because you really like me.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.003
I didn't shoot anyone.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.471
I know.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.340
So why did you
come to me?

35:41.407 --> 35:43.375
You're the only
mobster I know.

35:43.442 --> 35:47.646
You knew my friend Leo Finn.
And you killed him.

35:47.713 --> 35:50.015
Actually his
bodyguard killed him.

35:50.081 --> 35:52.618
Lovey Norris was
trying to shoot you.

35:52.684 --> 35:53.952
How do you know?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.121
Assumption.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.624
Good assumption.

35:58.690 --> 36:03.762
Suffice it to say,
but for your
exasperating directness,

36:03.829 --> 36:05.664
my friend would
still be alive.

36:05.731 --> 36:06.898
He wasn't your friend.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.267
Colleague.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.801
We went to
the same church.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.703
You were choir boys together?

36:12.871 --> 36:14.573
I didn't say that.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.609
So you won't help me.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.810
No.

36:20.145 --> 36:22.814
You could keep your
eyes and ears open.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.716
I always do.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.585
It's nice to see you,
Jesse Stone.

36:31.089 --> 36:34.660
COACH: Come on, come on.
Pick it up, pick it up.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.749
How's the crime scene
at Paradise Donuts?

36:57.816 --> 36:59.851
Under constant
surveillance.

36:59.918 --> 37:03.054
I feel donuts
certify one's copness.

37:03.121 --> 37:04.122
No coffee?

37:04.189 --> 37:05.357
My body's a temple.

37:06.458 --> 37:07.459
You want one?

37:07.526 --> 37:08.727
My body's a temple.

37:10.296 --> 37:11.730
You just getting
back from Boston?

37:11.797 --> 37:13.332
How do you know
I was in Boston?

37:13.399 --> 37:17.135
The information's out there.
All you have to
do is let it in.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.305
So who shot Healy?

37:19.371 --> 37:21.139
I have no idea.

37:21.206 --> 37:23.375
My sense is it had something
to do with the stakeout.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.176
It had nothing to do
with the stakeout.

37:25.243 --> 37:29.415
So you think.
So Healy knows.

37:29.481 --> 37:33.519
He was monitoring
a saxophone lesson.
Which leaves me nowhere.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.388
Stir the pot.
We going after this?

37:37.289 --> 37:39.224
I'm going after this.

37:43.629 --> 37:46.465
You still seeing
Cissy Hathaway?

37:46.532 --> 37:48.199
What do you mean?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.201
Well, she's older.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.538
How did you know?

37:52.604 --> 37:57.008
The information's out there.
All you have to
do is let it in.

37:57.075 --> 37:59.177
Do you feel
damaged in any way?

37:59.244 --> 38:01.580
No.
Cissy teach you anything?

38:02.213 --> 38:03.615
A lot.

38:03.682 --> 38:06.284
Well, there you go.

38:06.352 --> 38:08.954
How'd the Town
Council meeting go?

38:11.523 --> 38:13.191
You pick a fight?

38:14.493 --> 38:15.561
No.

38:17.363 --> 38:20.366
Maybe we should start
manning the speed trap.

38:20.432 --> 38:21.867
I don't like the speed trap.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.503
I know, "The speed
trap isn't ethical."

38:24.570 --> 38:27.373
Speeding is speeding,
Jesse. It's the law.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.775
The speed limit changes.
And nobody can see the sign.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.142
Exactly.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.382
You want to man it, man it.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.411
Getting shot didn't
slow you down.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.278
How do you know?

39:07.345 --> 39:10.649
Guess we'll have to wait
until you're healed
and try again.

39:10.716 --> 39:13.284
I like the word "again."

39:13.351 --> 39:15.421
So, Sidney...

39:15.487 --> 39:17.556
Did your wife
remarry, Jesse?

39:17.623 --> 39:19.458
No, Sidney.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.126
Now that we've had sex,

39:21.192 --> 39:23.161
do you think we could
stop with the whole
first name ping-pong?

39:23.228 --> 39:24.796
Of course, Sidney.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.865
I just like saying it.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.370
Who was Healy staking out?

39:32.438 --> 39:34.239
You're interrogating me
in your underwear.

39:34.305 --> 39:35.907
I'm asking you a question.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.543
It wasn't a stakeout.

39:40.646 --> 39:44.082
My husband just told me
his new wife is having
a baby.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.819
My wife...

39:47.886 --> 39:51.690
Ex-wife just moved
in with her boyfriend.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.592
So we're both feeling
kind of disposable

39:53.659 --> 39:56.327
and in desperate
need of consolation.

39:56.394 --> 40:00.231
And would be inclined to
turn a casual something
into more than it was.

40:00.298 --> 40:04.035
On the other hand,
there's nothing
wrong with consolation.

40:05.336 --> 40:08.273
So you think we
should be careful.

40:08.339 --> 40:13.044
I think we should
carefully do this again.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.017
Pals who have sex.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.822
I've heard it
described as that.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.893
I like you, Sidney.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.529
You're the first
person I've met
on the entire East Coast

40:30.596 --> 40:33.565
who's more afraid of
commitment than I am.

40:35.467 --> 40:39.070
Ever had sex with
a younger man, Sidney?

40:39.137 --> 40:42.307
Why do you ask?
I'm conducting a survey.

40:42.373 --> 40:44.776
Nothing to say to
each other afterwards.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.713
But the young man
had a hell of a ride.

40:50.415 --> 40:52.250
I'll let myself out.
Don't get up.

40:57.556 --> 41:01.126
I prefer to
think of you lying there
in your afterglow.

41:59.651 --> 42:01.887
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

42:09.360 --> 42:13.431
Overwhelming evidence
points in
the other direction,

42:13.498 --> 42:16.534
but there is no doubt
in my mind that

42:16.602 --> 42:20.038
that baby was
switched for Adam.

42:21.439 --> 42:23.408
MALE REPORTER:
Do you have any proof?

I just know.

You're early.

44:33.671 --> 44:34.773
You're earlier.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.810
You have a phone
message on your desk.

44:38.877 --> 44:41.112
Who was it?
He wouldn't say.

44:42.580 --> 44:44.950
I've been up all night.
I couldn't sleep.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.351
How do I do it, Jesse?

44:46.417 --> 44:47.886
I use Scotch.

44:47.953 --> 44:49.354
How do I find Adam?

44:49.420 --> 44:51.256
What have you got?
I don't have anything.

44:51.322 --> 44:52.523
We always have something.

44:52.590 --> 44:53.759
We?

44:53.825 --> 44:57.863
Figure of speech.
Just start at the beginning.

44:57.929 --> 45:00.799
December 28th, 2000,
Adam Blue is born.

45:00.866 --> 45:02.200
The next day,
he disappears

45:02.267 --> 45:04.269
from his hospital bed
in Albuquerque.

45:04.335 --> 45:06.637
Remains with his
wrist ID end up near

45:06.704 --> 45:08.907
the Mexican border
six months later.

45:08.974 --> 45:11.777
The authorities
assumed the kidnappers
escaped across the border.

45:11.843 --> 45:15.246
Well, they wanted
a closed case.
The Feds'll do that.

45:15.313 --> 45:17.615
You know, that river
runs from Albuquerque

45:17.682 --> 45:19.317
right down to where
the body was found.

45:19.384 --> 45:20.551
How do you know that?

45:20.618 --> 45:22.954
I played Triple-A
ball in Albuquerque.

45:23.021 --> 45:24.722
Anyway, it all but
dries up in the summer.

45:24.790 --> 45:26.858
They find a body
snagged on a branch.

45:26.925 --> 45:30.061
But it could have been
dumped in Mesita or
anywhere upstream.

45:30.128 --> 45:33.131
Isn't Mesita where
the body was found?

45:33.198 --> 45:35.967
It's a little town.
923 people.

45:36.034 --> 45:39.370
No Medical Examiner.
No tests. No ID,
except for the father.

45:39.437 --> 45:41.239
How do you know this?

45:42.240 --> 45:44.509
What's this?

45:44.575 --> 45:46.912
Some stuff.
Where'd you get it?

45:46.978 --> 45:49.114
Mailman.
It's from Albuquerque!

45:49.180 --> 45:52.383
When did you talk
to the mother?

45:52.450 --> 45:54.352
You believe
the boy is alive.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.487
No, I don't.

45:56.554 --> 45:59.690
But I do believe
Elizabeth deserves
a decent investigation.

45:59.757 --> 46:02.027
She sure hasn't
gotten one so far.

46:02.093 --> 46:04.662
She needs to move on.
The only thing that
will let her is certainty.

46:04.729 --> 46:06.898
So you're gonna help me?

46:06.965 --> 46:08.900
No.
Well, it seems to me

46:08.967 --> 46:10.836
we could find
a 7-year-old boy
a lot quicker

46:10.902 --> 46:12.070
if we were working
on this together.

46:12.137 --> 46:13.204
What do you need me for?

46:13.271 --> 46:15.440
You've just narrowed it
down by age and gender.

46:15.506 --> 46:17.208
What else do you know?

46:17.275 --> 46:19.210
There are 40,000
7-year-old boys
in this state.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.311
And how many
in Essex County?

46:20.378 --> 46:21.379
Five thousand.

46:21.446 --> 46:22.447
And how many in Paradise?

46:22.513 --> 46:23.614
About 67.

46:23.681 --> 46:25.516
Well, just find out
where they were born.

46:25.583 --> 46:27.718
You know, you keep this up,
you'll make detective
some day.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.687
We don't have detectives.

46:29.754 --> 46:31.456
No, but if we did.

46:35.927 --> 46:37.628
Be careful with that.

46:37.695 --> 46:39.597
What is it?
A letter.

46:59.384 --> 47:02.620
Thank you for not
wearing your stupid hat.

47:02.687 --> 47:05.623
The hat, in and of
itself is not stupid.

47:05.690 --> 47:06.858
Because?

47:06.925 --> 47:08.059
Because I designed it.

47:10.395 --> 47:13.098
Will you excuse us
for a moment, Alan?

47:17.168 --> 47:18.403
Please.

47:24.842 --> 47:28.947
There...
There might be somebody

47:30.581 --> 47:32.884
who works for somebody.

47:32.951 --> 47:37.822
Would this somebody
who works for somebody
be involved in prostitution?

47:37.889 --> 47:38.957
Mmm-hmm.

47:39.024 --> 47:40.858
Teenage prostitution.

47:40.926 --> 47:44.429
I've heard you have
scruples about that.

47:44.495 --> 47:46.932
Where on earth would
you get such an idea?

47:46.998 --> 47:50.101
From Captain Healy,
our gravely wounded friend.

47:50.168 --> 47:52.303
He's not a friend.

47:52.370 --> 47:56.141
This somebody
might hold a grudge.

47:57.909 --> 48:00.378
Do you have a name?

48:00.445 --> 48:03.648
No, you do your job,
you'll figure it out.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.750
Everybody says that.

48:08.453 --> 48:10.555
You a Red Sox fan, Gino?

48:10.621 --> 48:12.657
When they're winning.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.360
Well, you know,
the hardest thing
to hit is a triple.

48:15.426 --> 48:17.128
With your scruples
about prostitution,

48:17.195 --> 48:21.066
you give up
drugs and gambling,
that would be a triple.

48:23.834 --> 48:26.371
You can leave now,
Jesse Stone.

(CHILDREN SHOUTING)

49:02.740 --> 49:04.575
Talk to me.

49:09.447 --> 49:10.681
Sister Mary John.

49:13.184 --> 49:14.652
Jesse Stone.

49:17.922 --> 49:19.657
You're a long way
from Paradise.

49:19.724 --> 49:21.826
Why would you
remember me?

49:21.892 --> 49:24.129
You caught the killer
of one of my girls.

49:24.195 --> 49:25.396
You're in my good book.

49:25.463 --> 49:26.864
You have a bad book?

49:26.931 --> 49:29.667
Oh, yeah.
I'm looking for
someone in there.

49:30.335 --> 49:32.037
You want a coffee?

49:32.103 --> 49:34.905
I would never turn down
such an offer, Sister.

49:34.972 --> 49:39.544
In my line of work,
I find it best to
be totally honest.

49:39.610 --> 49:42.947
I remembered you
because I saw your
name in the paper.

49:43.014 --> 49:44.782
I'm hurt.

49:44.849 --> 49:47.252
This is about
the shooting?

49:47.318 --> 49:51.656
It is. Whoever did it
was involved in
teenage prostitution.

49:51.722 --> 49:53.924
How do you know?
I can't tell you.

49:53.991 --> 49:56.494
My girls aren't
always prostitutes.

49:56.561 --> 49:58.296
I know that.

49:58.363 --> 49:59.930
I think you're
a good guesser.

49:59.997 --> 50:02.100
And you need
a good guesser?

50:02.167 --> 50:03.734
I do.

50:03.801 --> 50:06.804
I'm looking for someone
capable of conduct
without conscience.

50:06.871 --> 50:09.140
And who runs
a string of pimps?

50:09.207 --> 50:10.841
That's correct.

50:10.908 --> 50:12.443
Bixy Chapelle.

50:13.378 --> 50:14.679
Bixy Chapelle
is the boss.

50:14.745 --> 50:17.315
I'm looking for a guy
who works for him.

50:17.382 --> 50:20.151
Somebody who
likes to get even.

50:20.218 --> 50:23.988
Pauly Palmieri.
Teddy Leaf.
Winston Monroe.

50:25.390 --> 50:26.391
How do you know?

50:26.457 --> 50:28.326
They're on my list.

50:28.393 --> 50:30.728
They've all had

50:34.732 --> 50:36.167
Thank you.

I know you're a nun,
but maybe we could
have dinner some time.

50:42.473 --> 50:43.974
I'd like that.

50:49.214 --> 50:52.883
I know you won't give him up,
but maybe you could
tell me who it isn't.

MAN: Hey, brother,
you got any spare change?

51:10.801 --> 51:12.170
No, do you?

51:13.704 --> 51:15.740
How many quarters you got?

51:16.541 --> 51:18.609
Six.

51:18.676 --> 51:21.146
I'll give you
five bucks for them.

51:25.950 --> 51:27.452
You're welcome.

51:27.518 --> 51:29.520
Jesse, where are you?
I paged you.

51:29.587 --> 51:30.621
That was you?

51:30.688 --> 51:33.458
That was me.
Councilman Comden
dropped by.

51:33.524 --> 51:35.360
He's okay.
How do you know?

51:35.426 --> 51:37.462
He likes movies.
Listen, is Suitcase there?

51:37.528 --> 51:41.232
No, he's out
manning the speed trap.
Showing the flag.

51:41.299 --> 51:43.368
How's he doing?

51:43.434 --> 51:47.338
Well, he called me on his
cell phone and said he hasn't
written a single ticket.

51:47.405 --> 51:48.539
Does he know why?

51:48.606 --> 51:50.408
No.
Well, don't tell him.

51:50.475 --> 51:51.709
Don't tell him what?

51:51.776 --> 51:52.943
Never mind.

51:54.512 --> 51:57.081
I took Doc Perkins
the names of all
the 7-year-old boys

51:57.148 --> 51:58.483
in the Paradise
school system.

51:58.549 --> 52:01.051
And he was at the birth
of every one of them.

52:01.118 --> 52:02.119
Small town.

52:02.187 --> 52:04.689
He said you brought
the subject up.

52:07.325 --> 52:09.894
Hey, what about
the homeschooled kids?

52:09.960 --> 52:11.362
Well, how would
you find them?

52:11.429 --> 52:14.332
I guess I'd have to talk
to the school board.

52:14.399 --> 52:16.701
Yeah, their parents
would need a permit.

52:16.767 --> 52:19.204
Carter Hansen's wife
is chairman of
the school board.

52:19.270 --> 52:21.172
Do you want him to know
that we're investigating

52:21.239 --> 52:23.007
a seven-year-old
out-of-state kidnapping?

52:23.073 --> 52:26.277
You're investigating
a seven-year-old
out-of-state kidnapping.

52:26.344 --> 52:28.379
You'll find a way, Rose.

52:50.167 --> 52:53.103
Eileen thought I was
looking a little peaked.

52:53.170 --> 52:55.072
So I'm taking some sun.

52:57.608 --> 53:00.211
I'm like a character
in Little Women.

53:01.212 --> 53:04.215
This is my nephew, Michael.

53:07.252 --> 53:11.422
Michael. He was on his way
to his saxophone lesson.

53:11.489 --> 53:13.057
Pleased to
meet you, sir.

53:13.123 --> 53:16.794
Jesse. You're enjoying your
saxophone lessons, Michael?

53:16.861 --> 53:18.329
I'm learning a lot.

53:18.396 --> 53:19.830
I'll bet you are.

53:19.897 --> 53:22.032
And he's getting
better and better.

53:22.099 --> 53:24.168
You must have
a good teacher.

53:26.471 --> 53:28.306
I should get going.

53:31.476 --> 53:33.778
It was nice to
meet you, sir.

53:36.647 --> 53:38.783
You're blocking my light.

53:45.456 --> 53:47.258
The IA lady came by.

53:47.325 --> 53:48.893
Greenstreet.

53:48.959 --> 53:50.828
She question you?

53:50.895 --> 53:52.263
Yeah.

53:52.330 --> 53:54.198
She's a babe.

53:54.265 --> 53:55.500
I didn't notice.

53:55.566 --> 53:58.436
You don't think
she's attractive?

53:58.503 --> 54:01.205
I heard a name,
Teddy Leaf.

54:03.073 --> 54:05.175
Thinks he's a tough guy.

54:05.242 --> 54:08.913
Tries to prove it by
beating on his women.

54:08.979 --> 54:13.183
He once punched
a kid named Linny Dale

54:13.250 --> 54:15.753
so many times
her heart stopped.

54:15.820 --> 54:17.455
Did you nail him for it?

54:17.522 --> 54:20.124
No, I didn't have enough.
I got him on a lesser.

54:20.190 --> 54:23.060
Couldn't let it go?
Wouldn't let it go.

54:24.562 --> 54:26.130
You think he shot me?

54:26.196 --> 54:27.298
Us.

54:27.365 --> 54:29.667
Do you think he shot us?

54:29.734 --> 54:31.569
Hell, I have no idea.

54:31.636 --> 54:34.171
For a while I thought
your nephew shot us.

54:34.238 --> 54:35.640
It was just a guess.

54:35.706 --> 54:38.343
It's a good guess.
One problem.

54:39.644 --> 54:42.046
He's doing
a nickel in Concord.

54:43.981 --> 54:45.282
Okay.

54:47.952 --> 54:49.019
Your bust.

54:49.086 --> 54:50.087
My bust.

54:51.656 --> 54:54.825
But then the Boston PD
would know that.

54:54.892 --> 54:59.330
But a hotshot sheriff
from Paradise wouldn't.

54:59.397 --> 55:03.300
Leaf is a bad guy
and you have no
authority here.

55:03.368 --> 55:07.171
I'm still State
Homicide Commander.

55:07.237 --> 55:11.175
And I am telling you,
do not pursue this.

55:11.241 --> 55:12.977
Hey, I'm just
a small town cop.

55:13.043 --> 55:15.380
Mostly I give out
parking tickets.

55:15.446 --> 55:17.982
I'm telling you
not to pursue this.

55:30.027 --> 55:31.462
I have plans this evening.

55:31.529 --> 55:33.263
This won't take long.

55:33.330 --> 55:34.732
What makes you so sure?

55:34.799 --> 55:36.667
I need you to run
a name for me.

55:36.734 --> 55:38.235
Is that all you need?

55:38.302 --> 55:40.405
No. But it will have to do.

55:42.773 --> 55:43.808
What's the name?

55:43.874 --> 55:45.009
Teddy Leaf.

55:45.075 --> 55:46.677
We already brought him
in for questioning.

55:46.744 --> 55:47.912
I thought he was
in Concord.

55:47.978 --> 55:50.715
He got out on parole
a month ago.

55:50.781 --> 55:52.417
You take his shirt off?

55:52.483 --> 55:55.085
No. Just yours.

55:55.152 --> 55:56.253
He came in
with his attorney.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.355
He has an airtight
triple-witness alibi.

55:58.423 --> 56:00.391
A family function.

56:00.458 --> 56:01.626
There's nothing we can do.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.794
You could give me
his picture.

56:03.861 --> 56:05.930
That's probably unethical.

56:05.996 --> 56:08.533
That hasn't
stopped us so far.

56:08.599 --> 56:10.635
You're a bad boy.

56:10.701 --> 56:12.136
I am.

56:21.345 --> 56:23.648
There's Teddy.

56:23.714 --> 56:25.916
Could you print
that for me?

56:30.955 --> 56:32.590
There's haunts
and associates.

56:32.657 --> 56:34.158
Print that.

56:50.274 --> 56:51.809
JESSE: That's illegal.

56:52.710 --> 56:54.144
It's okay.

56:57.247 --> 56:58.749
I'm a doctor.

57:03.788 --> 57:05.690
Great coffee.
Where do you get it?

57:05.756 --> 57:07.324
You're in my chair.

57:07.391 --> 57:09.960
It's a lot better
than my coffee.

57:10.027 --> 57:12.096
You want to wear my hat?

57:15.500 --> 57:17.034
Where you been?

57:18.869 --> 57:21.606
Fighting crime.
Where you been?

57:22.640 --> 57:24.141
Working on the shooting?

57:24.208 --> 57:25.409
Yes.

57:26.243 --> 57:27.277
Why are you here?

57:27.344 --> 57:29.346
Did you find the trigger?

57:29.413 --> 57:32.416
I've got a name.
He's got an airtight alibi.

57:33.484 --> 57:36.253
Airtight is where
all the fun begins.

57:37.488 --> 57:39.189
Guy's got two
felony convictions.

57:39.256 --> 57:43.227
In L.A., I'd just get
him on something else
and put him away for good.

57:43.293 --> 57:44.829
Why not here?

57:44.895 --> 57:47.097
No three strikes.

57:47.164 --> 57:50.067
Two-time loser gets
pinched for anything
more than littering,

57:50.134 --> 57:53.070
and a judge
can put him away
for a long time.

57:57.007 --> 58:00.778
I spent a lot of time
in an office like this
when I was a cop.

58:00.845 --> 58:02.279
You miss it?

58:03.413 --> 58:04.782
Every day.

58:05.850 --> 58:07.585
You could go back.

58:10.354 --> 58:12.022
Toxic for me.

58:13.558 --> 58:14.825
Me, too.

58:16.961 --> 58:18.896
Nothing happens here.

58:22.032 --> 58:23.333
You okay?

58:29.574 --> 58:32.476
You got plans tonight?

58:32.543 --> 58:35.746
That don't involve me
and network TV?

58:35.813 --> 58:37.281
Yes.

58:37.347 --> 58:38.916
No.

58:38.983 --> 58:40.818
I'll buy you dinner.

58:42.787 --> 58:44.288
I'd like that.

59:08.979 --> 59:11.582
I'm taking you
off Light Ads, Suit.

59:11.649 --> 59:13.784
Do you mean it?

59:13.851 --> 59:16.420
Yes.
The Town Council okay it?

59:16.486 --> 59:18.022
They will.

59:20.791 --> 59:23.227
How about a donut, Rose?

59:23.293 --> 59:25.730
They're coply. Jesse?

59:25.796 --> 59:27.364
My body's a temple.

59:27.431 --> 59:28.966
Clearly you've transcended.

59:32.236 --> 59:34.371
Suit, I need you
to do me a favor.
Anything, Jesse.

59:34.438 --> 59:37.875
He's not here, Jesse.
I talked to the school board.

59:37.942 --> 59:41.511
I told Hansen's
wife I was thinking of
homeschooling my youngest.

59:41.578 --> 59:43.948
She gave me all the names.
There are no 7-year-old boys.

59:44.014 --> 59:45.816
There aren't even
six or 8-year-old boys.

59:45.883 --> 59:48.185
Well, maybe you need
to expand the search.

59:48.252 --> 59:50.454
Check 7-year-olds
in Swampscott and Beverly.

59:50.520 --> 59:52.322
But the letter was
mailed from Paradise.

59:52.389 --> 59:55.159
You've been looking
for someone who's here
in the second grade.

59:55.225 --> 59:59.263
You need to be looking
for someone who was in
kindergarten two years ago.

59:59.329 --> 01:00:00.698
Because?

01:00:00.765 --> 01:00:02.332
The only way I'd write
a letter like that

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:04.735
would be if I was moving,
leaving town for good.

01:00:04.802 --> 01:00:06.937
If that letter was
postmarked two years ago,

01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:10.074
you need to check enrollment
for two years ago.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.945
I need to go back
to the beginning.

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:15.773
You showing the flag?

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:19.176
They need to see you
in the trenches, Jesse.

01:01:19.243 --> 01:01:22.012
I wrote four tickets.
Four parking tickets.

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:23.647
Nothing at the
speed trap?

01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:28.085
You know, there was
a tree in front of the sign
and somebody cut it down.

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:29.653
A vandal?

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.355
A police chief.

01:01:31.956 --> 01:01:34.058
Okay.

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:36.293
This guy, Teddy Leaf,
is a real creature of habit.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.595
He eats lunch at 12:00
at the same place every day

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:41.098
and whoever drew
up his haunts list
did a fine job,

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:42.800
I added a timeline.

01:01:42.867 --> 01:01:44.134
That's good
police work, Suit.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:45.435
I really appreciate this.

01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:48.105
I feel like I'm all
the way back, Lou.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.509
Just don't tell
the Town Council
where you were.

01:01:52.576 --> 01:01:55.880
Jesse! Eric Morton.
Born December 28, 2000.

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:57.647
Same day as Adam Blue.

01:01:58.182 --> 01:01:59.449
Parents?

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:01.786
Stephanie Morton, mother.
No father listed.

01:02:01.852 --> 01:02:04.454
Is there a work address?
I don't want to talk
in front of the kid.

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:06.090
It could be
just a coincidence.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:08.525
Cops don't like
coincidences.

01:02:08.592 --> 01:02:09.693
You think he's alive.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.228
I want him to be.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:19.036
Did you draw me in or
did I do it to myself?

01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:21.405
It's just who
you are, Jesse.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:31.081
ROSE: Excuse me.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:32.749
Are you
Stephanie Morton?
Yeah.

01:02:32.817 --> 01:02:34.651
I'm Chief Stone.
This is Officer Gammon.

01:02:34.718 --> 01:02:37.521
Hi.
Is there a problem?

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:39.723
Do you own a green Dodge?
Yeah.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:41.926
Have you used it today?
No.

01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:43.360
What about lunch?

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:45.595
I make my own.
I have a vegetable garden.

01:02:45.662 --> 01:02:46.730
Jesse, we don't need
to bother this woman.

01:02:46.797 --> 01:02:49.834
Excuse me, Rose.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.670
A green Dodge was used
in a hold-up of
a convenience store.

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:54.972
We didn't get
the license number,

01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:57.541
so we're just checking
everyone that we can.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.443
JESSE: Have you loaned
your car to anyone,
Stephanie?

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:00.577
STEPHANIE: No.

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:02.312
Is this your son?

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:03.547
Yeah, that's my Eric.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.615
He's gorgeous.

01:03:05.682 --> 01:03:07.351
Rose, do you mind?

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.855
Could your husband
have taken the car?

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.656
I'm not married.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:14.491
I don't know who
Eric's father is.

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:18.295
I had a lot of
issues back then.

01:03:18.362 --> 01:03:20.230
Drugs.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.299
Eric changed all that.

01:03:22.366 --> 01:03:24.869
From the first time
I held him in my arms.

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.873
Well, listen,
I don't think there is

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.340
anything to be
concerned about.

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:33.777
There's probably a hundred
green Dodges in the county.

01:03:33.844 --> 01:03:35.445
So, thank you.

01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:39.116
Nice to meet you,
Stephanie.

01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:43.954
ROSE: We could have
pushed harder.

01:03:44.021 --> 01:03:45.956
If she thinks
we suspect,
she could run.

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:47.357
Should we talk
to the son?

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:50.094
What's he gonna tell us?
We can't risk it.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.795
Jesse, what if
this is a coincidence?

01:03:51.862 --> 01:03:54.031
You take any
group of 23 kids,

01:03:54.098 --> 01:03:56.766
and odds are two of them
will have the same birthday.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.402
You made that up.
No, I didn't.

01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:02.272
How do you know?
I just know.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:05.775
You know,
if we're wrong about this,
we damage a couple of lives.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.077
So what are we
going to do?

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:08.946
Knock on doors
and accumulate data.

01:04:09.013 --> 01:04:12.216
But she did it.
She's the one.

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:29.299
Last call.
I'm good.

I believe you know
the position.

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:28.225
You got a badge?

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:34.498
Yeah? So?
You armed?

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:36.633
No, that would be
a violation of my parole.

sore there, Teddy?

I'm the one who shot you.

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:43.307
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:44.975
You tried to kill my friend.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:46.176
I've already
been through this
with the Boston cops.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:47.344
I saw you.

01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:49.013
And I have three people
that saw me elsewhere.

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:51.015
Well, I got a witness.

01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:53.817
A reluctant witness,
but we got him
on a drug charge.

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:56.253
He'll give you up.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.589
Just when things were
going so well for you.

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:01.958
I'll see you around, Teddy.

01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:31.288
I'm here!
Sorry to bother
you, ma'am.

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:32.422

ROSE: We were told
that a green Dodge

01:07:00.284 --> 01:07:02.819
was parked outside
all night long.
Could you verify that?

01:07:02.886 --> 01:07:07.023
Well, that's Stephanie's car.
Oh, sure. It's always there.

lived here, Mrs...

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:13.763
I've lived here forever.

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:14.964
Well, the green Dodge
was involved

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.600
in the holdup of
a convenience store.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:19.503
And we just wanted
to be sure that hers
hadn't been stolen.

It was here all night.

01:07:23.607 --> 01:07:25.575
Okay. Good. Thank you.

01:07:27.311 --> 01:07:30.580
We already interviewed
Mrs. Morton.
She seems very nice.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:34.851
Freeze-dried hippie,
but she turned
her life around.

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:36.120
How long has
she lived here?

01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:37.854
Stephanie grew up
in that house.

01:07:37.921 --> 01:07:40.357
Her mother gave it to her
when Eric was born.

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:41.625
When was that?

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:44.060
Six, seven years ago now.

01:07:44.128 --> 01:07:46.996
I remember when she
brought the baby home
from the hospital.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.932
I mean, from the airport.

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.767
I told her, you don't
go flying around

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:53.637
at Christmas as
big as a house.

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:56.773
But she went anyway.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.610
Some nonsense about
it being her last
shot at freedom.

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:02.979
And sure enough,
in the middle of nowhere,

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:05.515
she goes into labor
and has the baby.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:11.054
Can you remember
where in the middle
of nowhere was?

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:13.056
Somewhere out west.

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:16.059

01:08:26.002 --> 01:08:28.104
I know you're married,
but maybe we
could have an affair.

01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:31.675
Jesse, it's her.
She had a baby boy
in Albuquerque, New Mexico,

01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:33.743
on December 28, 2000.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:36.546
His birth certificate
said she named him Eric.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:40.384
His death certificate said
he lived less than a day.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.353
She put Adam's wristband
on her baby's body.

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:45.689
What do we do?

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:47.524
We've got to be careful.
The media gets
a hold of this,

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:50.160
they'll see to it
that the world knows
before Elizabeth does.

01:08:50.227 --> 01:08:51.761
To me, that's backwards.

She's not going
anywhere, Rose.

Did you give it to him?

01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:15.705
No.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.174

if you've been
using their cruiser

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:19.876
on your trips to Boston.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:22.145

a car anymore.
They know that.

They're building
a case against you.

I'm Internal Affairs.
It's what I do.

01:11:30.854 --> 01:11:32.221
He did it.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.590
Leave him alone.

01:11:35.425 --> 01:11:38.294
I know how you work.
You set people up.

01:11:38.362 --> 01:11:40.930
You gonna take
him in an alley
and shoot him?

we can't touch him.

Yes.

Can we go some place
where it's dry?

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:11.220
No. Talk to me
for a while.

01:13:11.287 --> 01:13:12.321
Why?

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:14.390
I need you not to
ask any questions.

01:13:14.458 --> 01:13:15.559
Why?

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:16.960
That's a question.

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:28.137
I want you to have
plausible deniability.
Why?

01:13:28.204 --> 01:13:29.706
I can't tell you.
Why?

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:32.842
Because if I tell you,
you can't plausibly
deny knowing it.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.043
But you know it.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:37.013

From a saxophone teacher.

Will the saxophone
teacher explain?

01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:09.378
No, she's not there.
Because?

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:11.347
Because I don't
want her to be.

to stay for backup?

to me one day,

01:19:32.335 --> 01:19:35.704
"suffered from extreme
hypothermia and abrasions

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:40.643
"when she jumped in trying to
save him. 'It was a horrible,
tragic accident,'

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:45.248
"Fire Chief Ned Williams
said in a hastily
arranged press conference.

01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:48.918
"'Any death of a child...'"

01:19:54.557 --> 01:19:56.292
It was an accident.

01:19:59.162 --> 01:20:02.098
She sent that letter
the day after he died.

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:06.002
"Your child is loved."

01:20:10.273 --> 01:20:13.576
They were here,
hiding in plain sight.

01:21:08.497 --> 01:21:11.234
You can only do
what you can do, Jesse.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:13.436
It happened on my watch.

01:21:15.638 --> 01:21:18.674
You got a registered letter.
I signed for it.

01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:21.744
It's from the Town Council.

01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:23.346
Read it.

01:21:23.412 --> 01:21:25.081
Read it out loud.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:43.432
"This is to
officially inform you

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:46.835
"that you are
suspended without pay

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.105
"pending an official review."

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:40.389
Could you return these
to Captain Healy?

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:45.661
What did you get
Teddy Leaf on?

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:47.363
Probably
breaking and entering,

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:49.698
concealed carry,
parole violations.

01:22:49.765 --> 01:22:51.067
Enough.

01:22:53.402 --> 01:22:56.105
They want the keys
to your cruiser.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:03.179
I guess you two will
have to arrest her.

01:23:03.246 --> 01:23:06.949
I'd consider it
a personal favor
if you could wait a while.

01:23:08.017 --> 01:23:09.852
How long is a while?

01:23:12.388 --> 01:23:14.123
Until I call you.

01:23:16.892 --> 01:23:18.994
She's not going anywhere.
