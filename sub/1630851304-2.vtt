11:37.965 --> 11:39.689
GOT ON HERE.

11:39.724 --> 11:47.448
AND THEN ALL WEEK WE GET TO
EAT SLOP FOR BREAKFAST, LUNCH,

11:47.482 --> 11:49.827
DINNER, LINNER, SNACK.

11:49.862 --> 11:51.724
OH, MY GOD.

11:51.758 --> 11:52.689
YOU'RE STILL COVERED?

11:52.724 --> 11:58.103
NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THE
COLD SHOWERS.

11:58.137 --> 12:00.586
THIS AIN'T IT.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.793
HOW DID THEY COME UP WITH
THESE IDEAS?

12:03.827 --> 12:06.965
THAT HAVE-NOT ROOM LOOKS
MISERABLE.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.275
THERE'S NO WAY.

12:08.310 --> 12:12.103
I'M PRAYING I DON'T HAVE TO BE A
HAVE-NOT THAT ROOM IS ATROCIOUS.

12:12.137 --> 12:12.758
GOT BLESS THEM.

12:12.793 --> 12:16.034
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.689
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

12:18.724 --> 12:22.137
I WAS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:22.172 --> 12:25.068
EVERY TIME THEY GO AFTER THE
EASY PERSON.

12:25.103 --> 12:26.344
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ME.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.379
NOT THIS YEAR.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.862
NO, NOT THIS YEAR.

12:28.896 --> 12:30.965
DEREK IS SOMEBODY THAT IS
INSEAR.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.517
WE GET EACH OTHER.

12:32.551 --> 12:36.172
WE CLICKED FROM THE SECOND WE
LOCKED EYES.

12:36.206 --> 12:37.862
GAVE EACH OTHER THAT LOOK.

12:37.896 --> 12:39.344
IT'S RIGHT OR DIE NOW.

12:39.379 --> 12:40.862
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS?

12:40.896 --> 12:41.689
LIKE FINAL TWO?

12:41.724 --> 12:42.344
YEAH.

12:42.379 --> 12:43.793
I TRUST YOU WITH MY LIFE.

12:43.827 --> 12:46.793
I SWEAR TO GOD --
SWEAR ON MY FAMILY.

12:46.827 --> 12:48.862
I PUT EVERYTHING DOWN LOW.

12:48.896 --> 12:50.344
I GOT YOU.

12:50.379 --> 12:52.000
I LOVE FRENCHY.

12:52.034 --> 12:56.517
PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO THINK
THAT ME AND HIM ARE WORKING

12:56.551 --> 12:57.448
TOGETHER.

12:57.482 --> 12:59.206
WE'RE COMPLETELY OPPOSITE TYPE
OF PEOPLE.

12:59.241 --> 13:02.034
WE LOOK LIKE THE UNDERDOGS,
WHICH IS GREAT.

13:02.068 --> 13:06.551
I'M LIKE LET'S KEEP DOING THIS
ALL SUMMER AND MAKE IT TO TEND.

13:06.586 --> 13:07.689
LET'S KEEP IT GOING.

13:07.724 --> 13:11.172
I'M NOT GOING WITH THE FINAL
TWO WITH NOBODY ELSE.

13:11.206 --> 13:14.862
EVERYTHING I LOVE IS ME AND
YOU.

13:14.896 --> 13:15.344
THIS IS IT.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.379
LET'S DO IT.

13:18.413 --> 13:19.000
I LOVE THIS.

13:32.965 --> 13:34.206
IS THAT CHRISTIAN?

13:34.241 --> 13:35.413
OR IS THAT TRAVIS?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.275
THE GUY WITH THE BLUE EYES.

13:37.310 --> 13:38.241
WHAT IS HIS NAME?

13:38.275 --> 13:39.172
CHRISTIAN.

13:39.206 --> 13:41.517
CHRISTIAN WITH THE BLUE ABES.

13:41.551 --> 13:43.344
HE HAS NICE EYES.

13:43.379 --> 13:44.517
BUT HE HIDES.

13:44.551 --> 13:50.448
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU NOW,
I'M HAVE PLANS TO BE THE

13:50.482 --> 13:52.344
SHOWMANCE KILLER.

13:52.379 --> 13:56.655
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW LIKE I REFUSE
TO NOMINATE WOMEN THIS WEEK.

13:56.689 --> 13:58.068
PERSONAL PREFERENCE.

13:58.103 --> 14:01.379
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

14:01.413 --> 14:02.724
I LOVE FRENCHY.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.724
I'M TIRED OF ALPHA MALES FORCING
THINGS THROUGH AND GETTING THEIR

14:05.758 --> 14:07.034
WAY TO THE END.

14:07.068 --> 14:11.206
KEEPING A WOMAN SAFE THIS WEEK
AND MAKING SURE THAT NO WOMAN IS

14:11.241 --> 14:14.000
NOMINATED IS COMPLETELY MY
VISION FOR THIS GAME PATH

14:14.034 --> 14:15.137
FORWARD.

14:15.172 --> 14:17.413
I'M SO HAPPY THAT FRENCHY AND ME
ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.

14:17.448 --> 14:21.448
THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE GOING
TO DO THE NORMAL, GO THE EASY

14:21.482 --> 14:26.482
ROUTE OR ARE WE GOING TO GET
PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW WILL BEAT

14:26.517 --> 14:29.206
US?

14:29.241 --> 14:32.103
AND LET US GO TO THE END
TOGETHER AND HAVE FUN THE REST

14:32.137 --> 14:32.758
OF THE SUMMER.

14:32.793 --> 14:34.448
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

14:34.482 --> 14:38.344
THE REASON I'M PROMISING
THESE PEOPLE SAFETY IS

14:38.379 --> 14:40.068
ULTIMATELY NEXT WEEK I DON'T
HAVE SAFETY.

14:40.103 --> 14:44.655
ON TOP OF THAT, IF I TELL YOU
YOU'RE SAFE, I'M GOING TO MEAN

14:44.689 --> 14:48.827
IT, SO I'M TRYING TO SET MYSELF
UP LONG-TERM.

14:48.862 --> 14:53.206
IF I CAN DO THAT, THEN I HAVE A
WAY BETTER CHANCE OF STAYING

14:53.241 --> 14:57.310
HERE AND MAKING IT TO THAT FINAL
TWO CHAIR.

14:57.344 --> 15:00.689
I WANT YOU TO BE LIKE YOU
REALLY HONESTLY DON'T HAVE TO

15:00.724 --> 15:02.344
WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING.

15:02.379 --> 15:05.586
IF I WIN HOH NEXT WEEK --
THAT'S ALL I ASK.

15:05.620 --> 15:06.793
YOU'RE FINE.

15:06.827 --> 15:11.034
IF YOU WIN HOH NEXT WEEK,
JUST RETURN THE FAVOR TO ME.

15:11.068 --> 15:13.827
IF IT STRESS, DON'T LET IT
BE.

15:13.862 --> 15:15.172
IT'S ANXIETY.

15:15.206 --> 15:18.724
IF IT'S INDUCED BY ME, DON'T
WORRY.

15:18.758 --> 15:19.862
OKAY.

15:19.896 --> 15:24.103
YOUR TIME IS LIKE -- YOU'RE
NOT WHERE NOT EVEN --

15:24.137 --> 15:24.931
I APPRECIATE THAT.

15:24.965 --> 15:25.689
THANK YOU.

15:25.724 --> 15:27.379
HONESTLY, I BELIEVE HIM.

15:27.413 --> 15:30.965
I KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T TRUST
ANYONE IN THE HOUSE, ESPECIALLY

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
DAY ONE BUT HE SEEMS LIKE A VERY
GENUINE PERSON.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.482
MY TEAM LITERALLY JUST LOST.

15:36.517 --> 15:42.034
TO KNOW I'M SAFE THAT PUTS SUCH
A WEIGHT OFF OF MY SHOULDERS.

15:42.068 --> 15:43.724
WE'RE GOING FAR.

15:43.758 --> 15:45.034
YES.

15:45.068 --> 15:47.689
SO BEING A FAN OF THE SHOW,
I'M NOT GOING TO DO THE THINGS

15:47.724 --> 15:53.724
THAT FANS EXPECT AND NOMINATE
THE USUAL SUSPECTS.

15:53.758 --> 15:55.172
I'M ABOUT TO SHAKE THINGS UP.

15:55.206 --> 15:56.310
WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.

15:56.344 --> 15:57.137
WE'RE PARENTS.

15:57.172 --> 15:59.931
I WILL RIDE WITH YOU,
FRENCHY.

15:59.965 --> 16:00.275
ALWAYS.

16:00.310 --> 16:02.034
I GOT YOU.

16:02.068 --> 16:02.965
I PROMISE.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.655
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT FRENCHY IN
THE HOUSE.

16:05.689 --> 16:07.241
HE SEEMS VERY GENUINE.

16:07.275 --> 16:10.068
I DEFINITELY SEE MYSELF WORKING
WITH FRENCHY.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.379
I DON'T PLAN ON EVICTING A
WOMAN THIS WEEK.

16:13.413 --> 16:15.000
THAT'S NOT IN MY PLANS.

16:15.034 --> 16:16.655
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO.

16:16.689 --> 16:17.965
IT WILL BE A MAN.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.931
AND NOW THAT I'VE TALKED TO
EVERYONE, TIME TO PUT MY PLAN IN

16:21.965 --> 16:22.862
MOTION.

16:22.896 --> 16:35.862
TIME TO GET A MEATHEAD OUT OF
THIS HOUSE.

16:35.896 --> 16:38.482
NEXT UP, HOME, MAN.

16:38.517 --> 16:40.862
YOU MUST HAVE SLEPT LIKE A
BABY.

16:40.896 --> 16:41.931
I DID.

16:41.965 --> 16:43.896
THIS BIG IS SO BIG.

16:43.931 --> 16:47.413
I'M LOOKING AT BRENT AS A
TARGET.

16:47.448 --> 16:49.275
DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO ME.

16:49.310 --> 16:50.103
SUPER DISTANT.

16:50.137 --> 16:52.448
ME BEING AN HOH THAT IS A BAD
IDEA.

16:52.482 --> 16:56.068
YOU WERE THE PERSON THAT I
WANTED TO SIT DOWN WITH AND SEE

16:56.103 --> 16:57.517
WHERE YOUR HEAD IS AT.

16:57.551 --> 17:00.172
WE DIDN'T GET THAT OPPORTUNITY
TO LIKE TALK AND THINGS LIKE

17:00.206 --> 17:01.448
THAT.

17:01.482 --> 17:04.275
I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON I THAT I
DON'T WANT TO ASSUME ANYTHING.

17:04.310 --> 17:11.413
FIRST OFF, I ADMIRE THE
PASSION YOU HAVE FOR YOUR

17:11.448 --> 17:12.724
FAMILY.

17:12.758 --> 17:15.896
WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN LIKE --
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR OWN KID,

17:15.931 --> 17:18.827
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE HOLDING LIKE
YOUR WHOLE WORLD IN YOUR HANDS

17:18.862 --> 17:19.793
AT THAT POINT.

17:19.827 --> 17:22.965
PERSONALLY, I LOST MY FATHER
TO SUICIDE.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.379
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMETHING
SO -- THAT MEANT SO MUCH TO YOU.

17:26.413 --> 17:29.413
MY FATHER WAS LIKE SUPERMAN TO
ME.

17:29.448 --> 17:33.344
JUST ONE DAY YOU'RE READING A
LETTER AND A NOTE THAT HE'S NO

17:33.379 --> 17:34.758
LONGER HERE WITH YOU.

17:34.793 --> 17:38.000
IT'S --
COME HERE.

17:38.034 --> 17:39.862
COME HERE, MAN.

17:39.896 --> 17:41.482
LIKE WE COME IN THIS HOUSE.

17:41.517 --> 17:47.206
I TRY NOT TO ASSUME THINGS ABOUT
PEOPLE BUT I LIKE ASSUME LIKE

17:47.241 --> 17:53.137
YOU'RE LIKE A HARD ASS.

17:53.172 --> 17:56.724
PEOPLE THINK OF ME, DUMB
SOUTHERN RED NECK.

17:56.758 --> 18:00.310
THERE'S MORE TO ME --
I GET JUDGED BEFORE I OPEN MY

18:00.344 --> 18:01.551
MOUTH.

18:01.586 --> 18:04.000
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN STEREOTYPED,
ALWAYS BEEN LABELLED AS THE

18:04.034 --> 18:05.000
JOCK.

18:05.034 --> 18:07.172
IT'S EASY TO JUST SAY HEY, THIS
GUY IS A TOOL.

18:07.206 --> 18:12.448
BUT IF YOU GAVE ME THE SMALL
CHANCE OF ALLOWING YOU TO HEAR

18:12.482 --> 18:16.758
MY STORY, PRETTY SHOVE THAT
YOU'D END UP BEING PLEASANTLY

18:16.793 --> 18:18.068
SURPRISED.

18:18.103 --> 18:21.068
THE REASON WHY I WAS A LITTLE
BIT MORE STAND OFFISH, I DIDN'T

18:21.103 --> 18:22.241
WANT TO OVERWHELM YOU.

18:22.275 --> 18:27.862
WHEN YOU WON THE HOH, YOU CAN
SMELL DESPERATION IN SOME

18:27.896 --> 18:29.068
PEOPLE.

18:29.103 --> 18:32.517
THAT'S WHY I'M SUPER GLAD
THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS TALK.

18:32.551 --> 18:36.448
LIKE ARE YOU GOING TO HELP
PROTECT ME NEXT WEEK.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.379
ABSOLUTELY.

18:37.413 --> 18:39.724
YOU HAVE MY ABSOLUTE WORD.
WORD GOOD.

18:39.758 --> 18:42.793
LIKE I SAID, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO YOU.

18:42.827 --> 18:44.344
I'M GOING TO HUG YOU.

18:44.379 --> 18:46.000
COME ON.

18:46.034 --> 18:49.275
> I WAS ORIGINALLY TARGETING
BRENT BUT I COMPLETELY MISJUDGED

18:49.310 --> 18:50.413
HIM.

18:50.448 --> 18:55.310
NOW I'M GOOD WITH BRENT, THAT
LEAST ONE LAST MEATHEAD.

18:55.344 --> 18:57.310
SO GOOD WE HAVE THIS
CONVERSATION.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.344
BEFORE WE GET ACCUSED OF HEADING
TO THE FINAL TWO.

19:09.551 --> 19:13.275
IT'S TIME FOR THE FIRST
CHALLENGE OF THE SEASON.

19:13.310 --> 19:16.000
THIS ISLANDER GOT HANDY UNDER
THE TABLE.

19:16.034 --> 19:18.931
WE WORK SO WELL TOGETHER.

19:18.965 --> 19:20.068
WE DO.

19:20.103 --> 19:21.793
SO WELL TOGETHER.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.448
WHAT THE HELL?

19:24.482 --> 19:26.586
WHAT'S THAT?

19:26.620 --> 19:30.034
SOMETHING TO PLAY WITH.
YEAH.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.517
SOMEONE IS HERE.

19:31.551 --> 19:32.620
OH, MY GOSH.

19:32.655 --> 19:34.034
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.

19:34.068 --> 19:35.379
WE'RE ABOUT TO DO ONE.

19:35.413 --> 19:40.448
HOUSE GUESTS, WELCOME TO THE
WILD CARD COMP.

19:40.482 --> 19:43.689
[APPLAUSE]
YES!

19:43.724 --> 19:47.344
JOKERS, SINCE WE'RE SAFE THIS
WEEK, WE WILL NOT BE COMPETED.

19:47.379 --> 19:48.034
OKAY.

19:48.068 --> 19:51.620
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

19:51.655 --> 19:55.413
EACH WEEK THE THREE ELIGIBLE
TEAMS MUST CHOOSE A PLAYER TO

19:55.448 --> 20:01.206
-SEND IN TO THE COMPETITION.
-ONLY
THREE HOUSE GUESTS COMPETE EACH

20:01.241 --> 20:03.034
WEEK IN THE WILD CARD COMP.

20:03.068 --> 20:06.862
THE PLAYERS COMPETING WILL HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GUARANTEE

20:06.896 --> 20:12.034
SAFETY FOR HIM OR HERSELF, BUT
NOT THE WHOLE TEAM.

20:12.068 --> 20:15.827
EARNING SAFETY EACH WEEK COMES
WITH A UNIQUE WILD CARD

20:15.862 --> 20:17.103
DECISION.

20:17.137 --> 20:20.413
ONCE THE WINNER IS ANNOUNCED,
EVERYONE WILL LEARN ABOUT THAT

20:20.448 --> 20:24.896
WEEK'S WILD CAR DECISION AND HOW
IT WILL IMPACT THE GAME.

20:24.931 --> 20:27.275
OH, MAN.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.344
MY HEART SUNK.

20:29.379 --> 20:37.103
ONCE THE PLAYER HAS PLAYED,
HE OR SHE CANNOT PLAY AGAIN.

20:37.137 --> 20:41.034
IF THE MAJORITY OF THE TEAM
CANNOT DECIDE A RANDOM DRAW WILL

20:41.068 --> 20:42.379
DETERMINE THAT WEEK'S PLAYER.

20:42.413 --> 20:44.000
SO WHO IS READY TO GET WILD?

20:44.034 --> 20:50.137
[APPLAUSE]
KINGS, QUEENS AND ACES.

20:50.172 --> 20:54.517
IT'S TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHO
YOU'LL BE SENDING THIS WEEK INTO

20:54.551 --> 20:56.000
THE WILD CARD COMP.

20:56.034 --> 20:58.827
[APPLAUSE]
WHAT THE HECK?

20:58.862 --> 21:01.241
I'M ALREADY ON PINS AND NEEDLES.

21:01.275 --> 21:05.896
I DO NOT NEED THIS TYPE OF
ANXIETY ON DAY TWO.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.689
HOW MUCH IS THIS WILD CARD
COMPETITION GOING TO SHAKE UP

21:08.724 --> 21:09.793
THE GAME?

21:09.827 --> 21:10.551
BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY SHOOK.

21:10.586 --> 21:14.620
I'M COOL WITH NOT DOING IT.

21:14.655 --> 21:16.620
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
HELL IT IS.

21:16.655 --> 21:17.655
I KNOW.

21:17.689 --> 21:18.827
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

21:18.862 --> 21:20.034
WHAT ARE YOU THINK SOMETHING.

21:20.068 --> 21:21.068
CAPTAIN.

21:21.103 --> 21:22.137
SIMPLE.

21:22.172 --> 21:24.000
BUT I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.103
I'M DO IT.

21:25.137 --> 21:27.206
BUT I'M WORRIED WHAT IF I WIN
THIS?

21:27.241 --> 21:28.758
THEY GOT SECOND AND WHATEVER.

21:28.793 --> 21:29.758
MAYBE SHE WON THIS.

21:29.793 --> 21:32.034
I DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS.

21:32.068 --> 21:33.586
ARE YOU KIDDING?

21:33.620 --> 21:34.551
IT'S WEEK ONE.

21:34.586 --> 21:37.206
I ALREADY GOT SECOND PLACE IN
THE HOH COMP.

21:37.241 --> 21:42.034
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MY THREAT
LEVEL ANY HIGHER BY KILLING THIS

21:42.068 --> 21:44.206
COMPETITION, WHICH I PROBABLY
WOULD.

21:44.241 --> 21:45.241
I'M CURIOUS WHAT IT IS.

21:45.275 --> 21:48.034
YOU WANT TO DO IT?

21:48.068 --> 21:49.655
YOU CAN DO IT.

21:49.689 --> 21:53.310
SINCE I'M SITTING HERE --
YOU CAN TAKE IT.

21:53.344 --> 21:58.206
THE ONLY THING I'M WONDERING,
WHO WINS NEXT WEEK.

21:58.241 --> 22:03.034
IS IT SOMETHING I DON'T AND --
KY, ARE YOU COMPETING?

22:03.068 --> 22:04.896
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

22:04.931 --> 22:07.931
DOES ANYONE REALLY WANT TO?

22:07.965 --> 22:10.482
DOES ANYONE WANT TO COMPETE?

22:10.517 --> 22:15.068
I FEEL OKAY PLAYING BECAUSE

22:15.103 --> 22:17.344
HE TOLD THAT TO ME, TOO.

22:17.379 --> 22:18.655
IT WAS GENUINE.

22:18.689 --> 22:24.137
MY GET IS TO GO WITH YOU,
CHRISTIAN.

22:24.172 --> 22:26.137
PEOPLE SEE YOU AS A THREAT.

22:26.172 --> 22:29.241
YOU THINK I NEED TO DEFEND
MYSELF THIS WEEK?

22:29.275 --> 22:31.000
YOU TO.

22:31.034 --> 22:32.137
HONESTLY, I DO.

22:32.172 --> 22:35.241
I BEING PERCEIVED AS A
COMPETITION THREAT PHYSICALLY

22:35.275 --> 22:37.931
BASED ON THE FIRST FEW COMPS.

22:37.965 --> 22:41.862
SO I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PLAY
THIS COMP AND SECURE MY SAFETY

22:41.896 --> 22:42.758
ONE MORE WEEK.

22:42.793 --> 22:44.793

22:51.724 --> 22:52.931
I'M LIMPING.

22:52.965 --> 22:54.034
I CAME HERE TO WIN.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.620
THE RULES SAY YOU CAN PLAY ONCE.

22:55.655 --> 22:57.931
A LOT OF GAME LEFT TO BE PLAYED.

22:57.965 --> 23:01.000
I MIGHT NEED SAFETY DOWN IF
ROAD.

23:01.034 --> 23:06.655
DO YOU WANT TO LET FATE
DECIDE AND PICK OUT OF US FOUR?

23:06.689 --> 23:08.379
PUT UP THE FAKE.

23:08.413 --> 23:12.034

I AGREE WITH YOU.

23:35.379 --> 23:36.103

23:36.137 --> 23:38.586
[APPLAUSE]
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

23:38.620 --> 23:41.724
YOU'RE GOING TO PLAN ON GOING
FOR SAFETY?

23:41.758 --> 23:44.275
I WAS PLANNING ON TARGETING
CHRISTIAN.

23:44.310 --> 23:51.620
IF HE WINS THIS COMPETITION, MY
WHOLE WEEK GOES --

23:51.655 --> 23:52.965
ACES.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.965
WHO ARE YOU SENDING TO PLAY?

23:55.000 --> 24:02.586
WE COULDN'T DECIDE, SO WE'RE
GOING TO LEAVE IT UP TO FATE.

24:02.620 --> 24:04.620
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY.

24:04.655 --> 24:07.896
AS TEAM LEADER, I FEEL LIKE I
SHOULD.

24:07.931 --> 24:09.344
I HAVE BEEN SO ANXIOUS.

24:09.379 --> 24:14.551
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO WIN THIS.

24:14.586 --> 24:24.034
TIME TO SEE WHO WILL BE
PLAYING FOR THE ACES.

24:24.068 --> 24:29.379
OH!
YES!

24:29.413 --> 24:35.344
NO!
YOU GOT THIS!

24:35.379 --> 24:39.724
SO I REALLY DID NOT WANT TO
PLAY IN THIS WILD CARD

24:39.758 --> 24:40.896
COMPETITION.

24:40.931 --> 24:44.034
BUT AS SOON AS MY NAME GETS
PICKED, I KNOW IT'S GO TIME.

24:44.068 --> 24:49.172
I'M BEING HANDED THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GUARANTEE SAFETY FOR THE NEXT

24:49.206 --> 24:49.758
WEEK.

24:49.793 --> 24:50.896
WHY WOULDN'T I TAKE IT?

24:50.931 --> 24:53.413
PLAYERS, TIME TO CHANGE IN
YOUR GEAR AND GET WILD.

24:53.448 --> 24:57.310
[APPLAUSE]
OH, MY GOSH.

24:57.344 --> 24:58.000
LET'S DO IT.

25:08.344 --> 25:10.655

28:59.724 --> 29:15.413
SO I SUCK IN THE GUT.

29:15.448 --> 29:16.620
OH, THE MARBLES.

29:16.655 --> 29:24.206
I AM MAKING THE MOST NOISE FOR

NO TIME TO WASTE.

29:31.620 --> 29:42.000
PEACE OUT BB CLUB, I'M OUT.

29:42.034 --> 29:44.655
I AM A TRAINWRECK RIGHT NOW.

29:44.689 --> 29:49.379
I'M JUST A HOT MESS EXPRESS
BECAUSE I AM RANDOMLY SELECT

29:49.413 --> 29:51.793
STOD PLAY IN THIS WILDCARD
COMPETITION AND I DON'T WANT TO.

29:51.827 --> 29:55.344
BUT NOW THAT I'M HERE HAVE I MY
GAME FACE ON AND I'M READY TO GO

29:55.379 --> 29:59.827
BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO KEEP
MYSELF SAFE FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

29:59.862 --> 30:01.517
THE BATHROOM IS AWFUL.

30:01.551 --> 30:04.482
THERE IS GARBAGE AND FOOD
EVERYWHERE.

30:04.517 --> 30:07.241
IT'S LIKE I'M BACK IN COLLEGE
WALKING INTO A FRAT HOUSE FOR

30:07.275 --> 30:09.068
THE FIRST TIME.

30:09.103 --> 30:11.344
MESSY, A MESS.

30:11.379 --> 30:12.448
DISGUSTING.

30:12.482 --> 30:16.034
SO I FINALLY FINNED THE KEY IN
THE SINK, IN THE DRAIN

30:16.068 --> 30:18.344
SURROUNDED BY ALL THESE MARBLES.

30:18.379 --> 30:25.758
I JUST CAN'T COMPREHEND HOW THAT
EVEN HAPPENED WERE THE CLOCK IS

30:25.793 --> 30:26.965
TICKING SO I GOT TO GO.

30:27.000 --> 30:34.689
I GOT TO GET OUT I HAVE TO CLIMB
OVER THIS BED TO GET TO MY

30:34.724 --> 30:35.241
WALLET.

30:35.275 --> 30:39.793
THEN I GRAB THE PHONE.

30:39.827 --> 30:45.310
AND THEN I MAKE A BEE-LINE TO
THE DOOR AND HOPEFULLY MY TIME

30:45.344 --> 30:46.586
IS GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP ME.

30:46.620 --> 30:49.931
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, YOU HAVE
FIVE MINUTES TO COMPLETE THIS

NOT ONLY DID IRAQ UP A WHOLE
TON OF POINTS FROM THE NOISE I

MADE, BUT ALSO IF WE WENT OVER
FIVE MINUTES THAN WE STARTED

31:22.862 --> 31:25.896
RACKING UP TIME PENALTY POINTS,
SINCE IT TOOK ME A LOT TOO LONG

31:25.931 --> 31:27.896

31:31.379 --> 31:37.724
WITH A TIME OF 3:41 AND YOU HAD

31:59.310 --> 32:00.448
HIGH SCORE.

32:00.482 --> 32:05.793

32:05.827 --> 32:06.137
COMPETITION.

32:06.172 --> 32:06.827
WHOOO!

FIRST WILDCARD COMP ALL MINE.

32:08.758 --> 32:12.724
I GOT SAFETY FOR THE WEEK.

32:12.758 --> 32:16.620
HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE.

32:16.655 --> 32:17.896
THIS WHEEL SEEMS SO OMINOUS.

32:17.931 --> 32:19.896
I DON'T LIKE THIS WHEEL AT
ALL.

32:19.931 --> 32:22.068
YOU CAN TAKE IT BACK, PUT IT IN
THE STORAGE.

32:22.103 --> 32:27.344
CHRISTIAN, AS THE WINNER OF
THE FIRST WILDCARD COMPETITION,

32:27.379 --> 32:29.517
YOU ARE SAFE.

32:29.551 --> 32:33.172
BUT MAY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION
THAT COULD GREATLY IMPACT THE

32:33.206 --> 32:34.413
GAME.

32:34.448 --> 32:36.586
YOU MUST SPIN THE WHEEL TO SEE
HOW MANY OF YOUR TEAMMATES YOU

32:36.620 --> 32:40.724
CAN KEEP SAFE THIS WEEK.

32:40.758 --> 32:45.482
IF YOU LAND ON THREE, CONGRATS,
YOUR WHOLE TEAM IS SAFE.

32:45.517 --> 32:49.862
BUT IF YOU LAND ON ONE OR TWO,
YOU WILL HAVE A TOUGH CHOICE ON

32:49.896 --> 32:51.068
YOUR HANDS.

32:51.103 --> 32:57.655
BECAUSE YOU MUST DECIDE WHO ON
YOUR TEAM IS SAFE AND WHO IS

32:57.689 --> 32:58.862
NOT.

32:58.896 --> 33:02.206
NOT ONLY IS CHRISTIAN SAFE
BUT NOW HE CAN SPIN TO SAVE

33:02.241 --> 33:05.344
MAYBE ONE, MAYBE TWO, MAYBE
THREE, OUR ENTIRE TEAM.

33:05.379 --> 33:07.793
SO THIS IS GREAT NEWS.

33:07.827 --> 33:10.068
THIS T IS TIME TO SPIN THE
WHEEL.

33:10.103 --> 33:15.172
OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT COULD
HAVE POSSIBLY WON THIS COMP,

33:15.206 --> 33:17.034
IT'S CHRISTIAN.

33:17.068 --> 33:17.965
CHRISTIAN.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.310
LIKE ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT
CHRISTIAN.

33:23.344 --> 33:24.413
OH MY GOD.

33:35.413 --> 33:35.620
CHRISTIAN, TIME TO SPIN THE

33:36.482 --> 33:42.586
WHEEL.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.793
BECAUSE CHRISTIAN WON THE
WILDCARD COMPETITION HE'S SAFE.

33:45.827 --> 33:49.793
BUT NOW HE GETS TO SPIN THE
WHEEL AND POTENTIALLY SAVE THREE

33:49.827 --> 33:52.137
MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM.

33:52.172 --> 33:53.793
THIS IS WORST-CASE SCENARIO
BECAUSE THE ODDS OF SOMEBODY

33:53.827 --> 34:02.482
FROM MY TEAM GOING UP, JUST GOT
THAT MUCH HIGHER.

34:02.517 --> 34:03.275
ONE.

34:03.310 --> 34:04.482
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

34:04.517 --> 34:05.344
YOU GOOD, YOU GOOD.

34:05.379 --> 34:08.000
YOU GOT SOMEONE SAVED, THAT
IS HUGE.

34:08.034 --> 34:09.827
I REALLY HOPE CHRISTIAN PICKS
ME.

34:09.862 --> 34:13.482
BEING SAFE THE FIRST WEEK WOULD
BE AMAZING.

34:13.517 --> 34:16.344
I DO NOT WANT TO BE THE FIRST
PERSON ON THE BLOCK, WHETHER IT

34:16.379 --> 34:17.517
IS A TARGET OR A PAWN.

34:17.551 --> 34:21.827
MY FRIENDS WILL NOT BE MY
FRIENDS ANY MORE IF I LEAVE IN

34:21.862 --> 34:23.241
WEEK ONE.

34:23.275 --> 34:23.655

34:23.689 --> 34:25.827
THANK YOU.

34:25.862 --> 34:29.206

34:30.517 --> 34:35.206
WE GOT FRENCHIE, AND ALYSSA,
THAT LEAVES ONE PERSON LEFT TO

34:35.241 --> 34:41.206
SAVE THIS WEEK, MY BOY XAVIER
AND I JUST DID THAT.

34:41.241 --> 34:45.793
WE'RE SMOOTH SAILING FROM HERE.

34:53.034 --> 34:57.034
YOU MIGHT AS WELL PUT MY
WHOLE WEEK IN A CASKET AND BURY

34:57.068 --> 35:01.448
IT, NOW THAT CHRISTIAN IS OFF
THE TABLE, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO

35:01.482 --> 35:05.241
CLUE WHAT I AM GOING TO DO WITH
THESE NOMINATIONS.

35:05.275 --> 35:09.827
THIS TOTALLY MESSES UP MY HOH
PLANS.

35:09.862 --> 35:21.137
I CAN'T HAVE THIS WEEK BEING
A-- .

35:21.172 --> 35:21.827
WHAT IT IS.

35:21.862 --> 35:23.241
HOW'S IT GOING.

35:23.275 --> 35:25.827
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN HERE.

35:25.862 --> 35:29.241
I WOULD RATHER BE DOWN HERE.

35:29.275 --> 35:33.793
IT'S HARD BEING THE KING,
MAN.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.206
THE CROWN IS HEAVY.

35:35.241 --> 35:38.000
EVERY TIME I SEE FRENCHIE
WALKING AROUND THE HOUSE HE IS

35:38.034 --> 35:41.103
LOST IN THOUGHTS.

35:41.137 --> 35:43.827
JUST RUNNING ON A SELF-INFLICTED
HAMSTER WHEEL GOING BACK AND

35:43.862 --> 35:45.379
FORTH.

35:45.413 --> 35:53.206
MY MAN JUST NEEDS TO TAKE A
COUPLE OF CHILL PILLS.

35:53.241 --> 36:01.862
HE DOESN'T-- WE WERE JUST
TALKING.

36:01.896 --> 36:05.275
I DON'T KNOW.

36:05.310 --> 36:13.586
IT IS OKAY.

36:13.620 --> 36:17.241
SO EVERY TIME I TURN A CORNER
FRENCHIE IS THERE.

36:17.275 --> 36:21.344
HE IS ON HIS HOH JOB.

36:21.379 --> 36:23.241
FRENCHIE IS LIKE THIS IS MY
HOUSING I CAN WALK THROUGH ANY

36:23.275 --> 36:28.103
DOOR I WANT TO I CAN CHECK IN
THIS ROOM, THIS IS HIS HOUSE.

36:28.137 --> 36:29.275
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE GOING
TO SAY.

36:29.310 --> 36:33.827
I DON'T LIKE CHRISTIAN'S
SLOP.

36:33.862 --> 36:35.241
WOULD YOU LIKE MORE CHRISTIAN
OR-- XAVIER.

36:35.275 --> 36:37.827
ARE WE RATE BE SLOP.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.655
YEAH, WE WERE.

36:39.689 --> 36:40.793
YOU PLATE IT NICE.

36:40.827 --> 36:41.827
CAN YOU ACTUALLY COOK.

36:41.862 --> 36:45.793
I REALLY CAN, BUT SLOP IS NOT
MY FORTE, OKAY.

36:45.827 --> 36:47.206
AND YOUR BIRTHDAY IS NEXT
WEEK.

36:47.241 --> 36:49.517
WE GET CAKE.

36:49.551 --> 36:49.896
WE'LL DO TACOS.

36:49.931 --> 36:52.275
PIZZA.

36:52.310 --> 36:53.482
I'M A VERY OBSERVANT PERSON.

36:53.517 --> 36:57.827
I'M NOTICING THAT WEEK THAT
CHRISTIAN IS FOLLOWING AROUND

36:57.862 --> 37:00.379
ALYSSA LIKE A LITTLE PUPPY DOG.

37:00.413 --> 37:02.827
THE ONLY THING I CAN'T STAND
MORE THAN A MEAT HEAD IS A

37:02.862 --> 37:03.758
TROLLMAN.

37:03.793 --> 37:05.275
DO YOU NEED HELP.

37:05.310 --> 37:09.862
I FEEL LIKE IF I HELP, IF WE
HELP.

37:09.896 --> 37:11.275
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, OKAY.

37:11.310 --> 37:21.310
I GOT TO BREAK THIS UP QUICK.

37:21.344 --> 37:22.551
I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU.

37:22.586 --> 37:26.172
I'M JUST PRETTY MUCH ASKING
LITERALLY EVERY PERSON LIKE JUST

37:26.206 --> 37:31.103

MISCONSTRUED.

37:31.137 --> 37:37.827
AND I HATE THE DAMN TELEPHONE,
AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THE

37:37.862 --> 37:45.517
TRUTH, HAS ANYONE APPROACHED YOU
FOR AN ALLIANCE YET?

37:45.551 --> 37:47.241
SORRY, I DON'T WANT TO ANSWER
FIRST.

37:47.275 --> 37:52.689
I FEEL LIKE FOR ME, NO, MINE IS
MORE SO WITH MY TEAM.

37:52.724 --> 37:53.206
YEAH.
