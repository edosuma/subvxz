WEBVTT

00:03.588 --> 00:07.562
My first guest was host of her own
late-night talk show, "Chelsea Lately."

00:07.563 --> 00:09.996
But you probably know her best
as that lady at the airport

00:09.997 --> 00:11.946
who asks for a pat-down.

00:11.947 --> 00:14.345
Chelsea Handler!

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:25.265 --> 00:26.478
Mwah!

00:26.802 --> 00:29.258
Hey, Scooter. Great job on
the Chelsea Handler booking.

00:29.259 --> 00:30.459
Yeah.

00:31.254 --> 00:33.862
Have a seat, yes. Welcome, welcome.

00:33.863 --> 00:35.880
- Thank you for having me.
- Scooter?

00:36.600 --> 00:39.435
- Uh... hello?
- Huh!

00:39.436 --> 00:41.040
Sometimes after mom goes to bed,

00:41.041 --> 00:45.400
I, uh, switch the TV up to
the naughty-language channels.

00:45.516 --> 00:48.809
Yeah. And that's where
I found Chelsea Handler,

00:48.877 --> 00:50.797
telling her sassy jokes.

00:51.075 --> 00:52.889
I was, uh...

00:52.890 --> 00:55.343
pardon my naughty language... smitten.

00:55.888 --> 00:58.888
Yeah. She really filled in some of the gaps

00:58.889 --> 01:00.877
from the talk we got back in health class.

01:00.878 --> 01:02.107
Now, you would know.

01:02.108 --> 01:04.209
How is it out there in the dating world?

01:04.211 --> 01:06.955
Ugh. Honestly, I am fresh
off of another nightmare.

01:06.956 --> 01:11.125
I mean, I was dating some club
promoter/bouncer who was so oily,

01:11.126 --> 01:13.508
by the time I threw my drink
at him, he didn't even get wet.

01:17.852 --> 01:19.410
I think what I'm looking for...

01:19.411 --> 01:20.899
and I'm finally willing to admit it...

01:20.900 --> 01:22.513
is just somebody who's nice...

01:22.514 --> 01:24.664
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and has a steady job.

01:24.665 --> 01:27.468
Wait! I'm a nice guy with a steady job.

01:27.469 --> 01:31.472
You know, some sweetheart
who's thoughtful and optimistic.

01:31.473 --> 01:34.349
Oh, my God. She's describing me.

01:34.350 --> 01:40.428
I guess I'm just looking
for a kind, lovable dork.

01:40.429 --> 01:41.951
Darn it! So close!

01:41.952 --> 01:44.172
Are you kidding me? You're a textbook dork.

01:44.173 --> 01:46.424
- No, I'm not.
- Scooter, you yell "Whee"

01:46.425 --> 01:48.304
- every time you ride an escalator.
- Well, excuse me

01:48.305 --> 01:50.292
for enjoying the magical flying stairs.

01:50.293 --> 01:52.995
And last Friday night, instead
of club hopping with me,

01:52.996 --> 01:54.788
- you were...
- Shooting a YouTube video

01:54.789 --> 01:57.066
on how to make a spartan
helmet out of cereal box.

01:57.067 --> 01:58.935
- Cheese and crackers, I am a dork.
- Yep.

01:58.936 --> 02:02.894
Fellas, I think I got a shot
at being Chelsea Handler's man!

02:02.928 --> 02:05.063
Mm... boy toy.

02:05.378 --> 02:08.913
Trust me, Scooter. You are a boy toy.

Hey! Hey, Kermit.

02:43.591 --> 02:46.114
- Yeah?
- Kermit, I got some great news.

02:46.115 --> 02:47.315
- Yeah?
- I'm thinking about taking

02:47.316 --> 02:49.809
the next big step in my
relationship with Becky.

02:49.810 --> 02:51.568
You're gonna tell her you're losing

02:51.569 --> 02:53.526
the hair on your stomach
and those are mostly plugs?

02:53.527 --> 02:55.295
- It's coming in good, huh? I can swim,
- Mm-hmm.

02:55.296 --> 02:56.496
ride horses...

02:56.497 --> 03:00.259
Anyway, tomorrow, I'm asking
Becky to move in with me.

03:00.311 --> 03:03.313
- You're what?!
- Yeah, it's gonna be fantastic.

03:03.314 --> 03:04.718
I'll never have a moment alone again.

03:04.719 --> 03:07.384
Plus, she just started to
learn how to play the violin.

03:07.385 --> 03:09.395
So I get to listen to that!

03:09.402 --> 03:11.647
- Mm.
- Oh! And it's gonna be so much fun

03:11.648 --> 03:14.058
sharing my one little bathroom together.

03:14.059 --> 03:16.792
Uh, y-you know, Fozzie,
you barely know Becky.

03:16.793 --> 03:19.621
Know her? We've been
together for 12 whole weeks.

03:19.622 --> 03:23.051
This is the longest relationship
of my life by 11 whole weeks.

03:23.052 --> 03:24.961
So, uh, I guess your mind's made up, huh?

03:24.962 --> 03:26.985
Kermit, I wouldn't be doing this

03:26.986 --> 03:28.882
if I didn't know she was perfect.

03:28.883 --> 03:30.446
- Yeah?
- Man, this is gonna be great!

03:30.447 --> 03:32.734
I cannot wait to let someone else

03:32.735 --> 03:36.345
tell me what I should
watch on TV at night. Oh!

03:36.346 --> 03:38.147
- Hey... hey, Fozzie? Uh...
- Mm?

03:38.620 --> 03:41.033
...you know, I haven't had a
lot of time to spend with Becky.

03:41.034 --> 03:43.208
Um... how about we all go out tonight

03:43.209 --> 03:44.620
and get to know each other better?

03:44.621 --> 03:46.749
It's trivia night at
Rowlf's. We can go there.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.651
Becky wins all the time, too.

03:48.652 --> 03:51.835
And they got amazing prizes, like beer...

03:54.526 --> 03:56.201
Maybe it's just beer. See you there?

03:56.202 --> 03:57.559
- You bet.
- All right!

03:57.560 --> 04:00.098
Tonight. Looking forward to it.

04:00.099 --> 04:02.979
Ah. You're a big fella, aren't ya?

04:03.270 --> 04:06.524
- Nyow, nyow.
- One of the things I love

04:06.525 --> 04:09.395
about Fozzie is his
innocent, child-like quality.

04:09.758 --> 04:12.012
That's also why I have to look out for him.

04:12.013 --> 04:13.849
- Ow! Ow!
- Oops!

04:13.850 --> 04:15.762
He's not ready to move in with anybody...

04:15.763 --> 04:17.119
Ow!

04:17.120 --> 04:18.976
...much less someone he met 12 weeks ago.

04:18.976 --> 04:21.523
That's way too big a step.
You can't rush these things.

04:21.524 --> 04:22.724
- R-right, Bobo?
- What?

04:23.727 --> 04:25.894
Wh... y-ou talking to me?

04:25.962 --> 04:27.923
Yeah, for the last five minutes.

04:27.924 --> 04:29.608
Ooh!

04:29.609 --> 04:31.866
I thought you were doing one
of those interview thingies.

04:31.867 --> 04:33.406
- No.
- Hey, can you do me a favor?

04:33.407 --> 04:34.712
Can you open this?

04:34.713 --> 04:36.602
These tabs aren't made for paws.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.101
- _
- Okay, guys,

04:38.102 --> 04:40.084
I'm gonna go in there
and I'm gonna ask her out.

04:40.085 --> 04:42.788
So, why you standing like that,
with your hands on your hips?

04:42.789 --> 04:44.927
You look like one of those
little girls in a beauty pageant.

04:44.928 --> 04:46.661
- Sí, and not the winner.
- No.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.487
Listen, if you're gonna ask Chelsea out,

04:48.488 --> 04:50.241
you got to do something
else with your hands.

04:50.242 --> 04:51.442
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay. Well,

04:51.443 --> 04:52.917
maybe I'll just... I'll move them around,

04:52.918 --> 04:55.045
you know, like people do when they talk.

04:55.046 --> 04:57.009
- No, no, no. Do not do this, okay?
- No. Mnh-mnh.

04:57.010 --> 04:58.685
You're trying to land a woman, not a plane.

04:58.686 --> 04:59.906
- Yeah.
- Okay, now you guys are

04:59.907 --> 05:01.164
just getting in my head.

05:01.165 --> 05:02.689
I've never thought about my hands before,

05:02.690 --> 05:04.493
and I am not gonna start now.

05:04.494 --> 05:06.704
- Hmm! Suit yourself.
- Okay.

05:06.705 --> 05:08.643
Come in.

05:09.919 --> 05:11.598
Oh, hey, Chelsea!

05:11.599 --> 05:13.734
Uh, great job out there.

05:13.735 --> 05:15.647
Oh, thanks, Scooter. I appreciate it.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.116
- Mm-hmm.
- You've been so sweet to me all day.

05:18.117 --> 05:19.439
Oh! Well

05:19.440 --> 05:22.431
Yes, I've, uh... I've also been a dork.

05:22.432 --> 05:25.177
And not just today, but,
uh, for my whole life.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.667
Yep, been a dork. Anyway, um...

05:29.204 --> 05:30.972
Uh... um...

05:31.039 --> 05:33.930
I, uh... I hope this
isn't, uh, too forward,

05:33.931 --> 05:35.965
but, um, I was wondering

05:35.966 --> 05:38.185
if, um, oh, I don't know,

05:38.186 --> 05:41.731
maybe, uh, you'd like to, uh, go... Oh!

05:41.732 --> 05:44.866
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

05:46.160 --> 05:49.609
Heavens to Betsy, you're
covered in crudité!

05:49.610 --> 05:51.181
Ah, I'm just gonna go get a paper towel

05:51.182 --> 05:54.514
to clean up all this raaaaanch! Uh!

05:54.763 --> 05:58.306
Ooh... oh, God, this is embarrassing.

05:58.675 --> 06:01.758
I came here to ask you out,

06:02.353 --> 06:05.255
but I just made a big gosh-darn mess of it!

06:05.256 --> 06:07.962
Oh, I don't care at all.

06:07.963 --> 06:10.148
Look!

06:10.149 --> 06:12.193
I don't even have to
clean any of this stuff up.

06:12.194 --> 06:14.765
Some poor schlub from
production will do it.

06:14.766 --> 06:16.344
Uh, yeah. That's me.

06:16.650 --> 06:19.426
It's okay. I'll just, um, call Mom

06:19.427 --> 06:21.049
and tell her I'll be home a little late.

06:21.050 --> 06:23.271
You know what? Tell
your mom not to wait up.

06:23.312 --> 06:25.281
You have a hot date tonight.

06:25.595 --> 06:28.348
I do? Cool! Uh...

06:28.349 --> 06:31.325
Uh, and just so you know,
I don't live with my mom.

06:31.326 --> 06:32.726
That'd be weird, right?

06:32.727 --> 06:34.802
I live in a room in my mom's house.

06:34.803 --> 06:37.037
Yeah, I have my own
microwave, mini-fridge,

06:37.038 --> 06:38.972
dust-Buster, which she's always borrowing,

06:38.973 --> 06:40.897
- and I'm always like, "Mom, will y..."
- You know what, Scooter?

06:40.898 --> 06:42.973
When you get a yes, just
kind of go with that.

06:43.081 --> 06:47.204
Mm. Beautiful and wise, just like my Mmm...

06:47.205 --> 06:49.146
You.

06:49.454 --> 06:51.745
Mm-hmm. You.

06:52.332 --> 06:53.623
All right, next question.

06:53.701 --> 06:55.456
What famous crime boss

06:55.457 --> 06:58.054
was behind the Valentine's day massacre?

06:58.191 --> 06:59.524
So, do you know the answer?

06:59.822 --> 07:02.357
Sure do. But now I can't
remember the question.

07:04.612 --> 07:05.950
The answer is...

07:07.004 --> 07:08.262
"Al Capone"!

07:08.263 --> 07:10.397
Oh, we got it! We got it!

07:10.465 --> 07:11.791
Al Capone! We got it right!

07:11.792 --> 07:13.971
You are on fire! We're gonna win...

07:14.327 --> 07:17.515
"A bucket of beers or a
food item of comparable value

07:17.516 --> 07:19.640
- not including extreme nachos"!
- Whoo!

07:19.641 --> 07:20.841
Aww, great! Hey,

07:20.842 --> 07:23.163
hey, speaking of Al
Capone, did anybody here

07:23.164 --> 07:26.861
ever break the law in a way that would
make for fun table conversation? Uh, Becky?

07:26.938 --> 07:28.138
Yeah.

07:28.283 --> 07:30.409
Sometimes, I pop a crouton into my mouth

07:30.410 --> 07:32.224
before I pay for my salad at whole foods.

07:32.225 --> 07:34.376
- Ah!
- Aw, everybody does that.

07:34.377 --> 07:36.614
My Uncle Willard spent a
little time in the clink.

07:36.615 --> 07:38.080
- What?
- He didn't realize you needed a permit to

07:38.081 --> 07:40.849
have all those pet tigers. He
would've gotten away with it, too,

07:40.850 --> 07:43.349
if that wind storm didn't
knock the door off the barn.

07:43.350 --> 07:44.757
Okay, uh... how about we, uh, talk

07:44.758 --> 07:46.805
about something else, like,
uh, o-our credit scores.

07:46.806 --> 07:49.196
- Ohh!
- Uh, mine is 760. Uh, Becky?

07:49.197 --> 07:50.737
- Mine's 210.
- Wha...

07:50.805 --> 07:53.276
210? But... but you're born with like 250.

07:53.277 --> 07:55.663
Yeah, I walked away from
a condo in San Diego.

07:55.664 --> 07:57.099
All right, next question.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.398
Who succeeded President William McKinley

07:59.399 --> 08:02.174
- after he was assassinated in 1901?
- Oh...

08:02.175 --> 08:03.905
Hint... it wasn't a dog.

08:03.992 --> 08:06.434
Canine-Americans still
can't hold public office.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.549
- Guys, it's a trick question.
- I don't know.

08:08.550 --> 08:10.489
McKinley's a mountain, not a president.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.023
But Mount Rushmore is four presidents,

08:13.024 --> 08:16.330
ergo the answer is President Rushmore!

08:16.331 --> 08:17.929
- Uh...
- Oops!

08:18.143 --> 08:19.522
Dropped my pencil.

08:19.523 --> 08:22.809
Hm? Oh, oh, y-you okay? Need some help?

08:23.344 --> 08:26.359
The question is, "Who
succeeded William McKinley

08:26.360 --> 08:29.030
after he was assassinated in 1901?"

08:29.227 --> 08:31.338
- That's a toughie.
- I just remembered.

08:31.339 --> 08:32.788
- Hmm?
- It's Teddy Roosevelt.

08:32.789 --> 08:35.892
- Oh, no.
- What, you don't think that's it?

08:35.893 --> 08:38.227
No, Fozzie, I'm... I'm
pretty positive that's it.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.144
You know, Becky is, uh...

08:40.405 --> 08:42.061
Well... she's... she's like the Internet.

08:42.062 --> 08:43.261
Ah. Hmm.

08:43.263 --> 08:44.498
- Can I talk to you at the bar?
- What?

08:44.499 --> 08:45.947
- Uh, excuse us for a second.
- Um...

08:45.948 --> 08:47.859
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
- Be right back.

08:48.062 --> 08:49.559
You are like the Internet.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.210
Aww, thank you.

08:51.211 --> 08:52.928
What's going on?

08:53.160 --> 08:54.628
I just saw something under the table

08:54.629 --> 08:56.010
that I did not want to see.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.511
Oh, Fozzie's got hair plugs
on his belly, doesn't he?

08:58.512 --> 09:00.571
It's newer hair, and the color's off...

09:00.572 --> 09:02.668
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But Becky
was looking at her phone.

09:02.669 --> 09:04.069
I think maybe she was cheating.

09:04.070 --> 09:06.540
Oh, so? It's just a silly bar game.

09:06.541 --> 09:08.952
Well, sure. But I-if
she's willing to do that

09:08.953 --> 09:12.015
to win a bucket of beers or a
food item of comparable value,

09:12.016 --> 09:13.534
don't you think I should let Fozzie know?

09:13.535 --> 09:16.411
Listen, Kermit, if you start
meddling in Fozzie's business,

09:16.412 --> 09:18.196
it's gonna ruin your friendship.

09:18.197 --> 09:19.855
Yeah, but... I-I don't want to see

09:19.856 --> 09:22.025
him get himself into a bad situation.

09:22.026 --> 09:23.307
H-he's my best friend.

09:23.308 --> 09:26.458
If you love him, you'll keep your
cute little green trap zipped.

09:26.459 --> 09:28.376
- But don't you think he should know?
- Zip it.

09:28.561 --> 09:31.663
And the president we're
looking for is Teddy Roosevelt.

09:31.664 --> 09:33.650
Yeah!

09:33.862 --> 09:35.796
- See? There, I think she did it aga...
- Zip.

09:35.939 --> 09:37.180
Fine.

09:37.584 --> 09:40.139
So, uh, Chelsea, you strike me

09:40.140 --> 09:42.331
as someone who grew up
in Livingston, New Jersey,

09:42.332 --> 09:43.948
and is the youngest of six children.

09:43.949 --> 09:45.457
Really? Is that how I strike you?

09:45.458 --> 09:48.683
Or did somebody do a pre-date
Wiki search on someone?

09:48.764 --> 09:51.540
What? No! Everybody knows that at age 19

09:51.541 --> 09:53.922
you moved to Los Angeles
to pursue an acting career.

09:53.923 --> 09:56.091
And Handler once dated rapper 50 Cent.

09:56.092 --> 09:58.815
You are so ridiculous. I can't take it.

09:58.816 --> 10:00.250
Well...

10:00.251 --> 10:02.056
Hmm? What?

10:02.832 --> 10:04.811
Whoa! Uh, uh...

10:04.812 --> 10:06.646
Uh, sorry, Chelsea, uh...

10:07.292 --> 10:08.564
I got to go.

10:08.627 --> 10:10.083
We didn't even have our dessert yet.

10:10.084 --> 10:11.284
No, no, no. No, no, no.

10:11.285 --> 10:13.875
- Too much sugar. Too much sugar for me.
- We can order some

10:13.876 --> 10:15.597
- fresh berries. That's...
- Too much sugar!

10:18.477 --> 10:22.752
May I have a turtle sundae with
a milkshake and a margarita?

10:24.529 --> 10:25.909
I don't think he washes his hands.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.365
- I don't think so, either. Oh, oh!
- Oh, there's Scooper!

10:27.366 --> 10:28.637
Hey, hey, hey! Scooter, Scooter, Scooter,

10:28.638 --> 10:30.001
- Scooter, Scooter! So,
- Yeah? Yeah?

10:30.002 --> 10:32.005
how'd it go with Chelsea, huh?

10:32.006 --> 10:33.408
A-and don't skip the dirty stuff,

10:33.409 --> 10:35.844
'cause I was born in a sewer;
You are not gonna shock me.

10:35.874 --> 10:37.442
Well, uh, Chelsea was fun,

10:37.443 --> 10:39.427
but, uh, I-I don't think
I'm gonna see her again.

10:39.428 --> 10:40.628
- What?!
- Mnh-mnh.

10:40.629 --> 10:43.668
- Ohh. Well, you must trust your heart.
- Yeah,

10:43.669 --> 10:45.385
- Because your heart is never wrong.
- yeah. That's true.

10:45.386 --> 10:48.324
Yeah, yeah. She got way
too physical way too fast.

10:48.325 --> 10:50.642
I stand corrected.

10:50.643 --> 10:52.115
Your heart is very, very stupid.

10:52.116 --> 10:54.407
- Well, you weren't there, Pepe.
- Sí, I know.

10:54.408 --> 10:56.972
But if I was there, I would still be there.

10:56.973 --> 10:59.084
Well, I'm not a randy
little sea bug like you.

10:59.085 --> 11:00.995
Anyway, I've been ignoring her texts,

11:00.996 --> 11:03.361
so I'm pretty sure she got the message.

11:05.690 --> 11:07.230
Uh, I don't think she got the message.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.498
- Wow!
- Whoo!

11:08.499 --> 11:09.888
- Would you look at this?
- Oh-ho!

11:09.889 --> 11:11.505
- Wow!
- Wait, wait, wait. Hang on, guys. Hang on.

11:11.506 --> 11:12.494
- We don't know it's from her.
- Wow!

11:12.495 --> 11:13.735
I got to read the card.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.846
Uh, "Dear Scooter..."

11:15.847 --> 11:17.354
Okay, so far, it could be from anyone.

11:17.355 --> 11:18.393
- It's from Chelsea.
- Yep.

11:18.394 --> 11:19.846
"Last night was fun."

11:19.847 --> 11:21.889
That could be the valet, the waitress.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.324
- It's from Chelsea.
- Yep.

11:23.325 --> 11:25.216
"I can't stop thinking
about our good-night kiss."

11:25.217 --> 11:26.791
So, we're down to Chelsea and my mom.

11:26.792 --> 11:29.289
- Ugh!
- Let us pray it's from Chelsea.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.209
- Okay, fine. It's from Chelsea.
- Hm.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.592
Oh, fudgsicles! I got
to go break up with her.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.196
Hey, hey, hey. Look at the bright side.

11:35.197 --> 11:36.832
If you had to break up with your mother,

11:36.833 --> 11:38.194
you'd have no place to live.

11:39.569 --> 11:41.705
- Because he lives with his mama! Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!

11:46.005 --> 11:47.837
There he is!

11:47.838 --> 11:50.187
- How much fun was last night, huh?
- Yeah...

11:50.188 --> 11:53.053
I mean, who knew Indonesia
had the most volcanoes?

11:53.108 --> 11:55.676
Well, besides the people
running from lava in Indonesia,

11:55.677 --> 11:57.714
- Uh, Becky.
- Can you believe her?

11:57.715 --> 11:59.854
You can ask that woman any
question, and she'll have

11:59.855 --> 12:02.128
- the answer. History, geography,
- Mm.

12:02.129 --> 12:03.818
what the thing was on my back.

12:03.819 --> 12:06.346
- W-well, what was it?
- Paint. I leaned against a building.

12:06.347 --> 12:08.022
- Ah.
- Anyways, I'm really glad

12:08.023 --> 12:09.351
you liked her, 'cause...

12:09.604 --> 12:12.155
She's meeting me here for lunch, and then

12:12.281 --> 12:14.174
I'm giving her the key to my house.

12:14.175 --> 12:17.698
Look. I put it on this beautiful
sterling-silver key chain.

12:17.754 --> 12:20.327
Oh, th-the one I gave you
last year for Christmas.

12:20.328 --> 12:23.916
Yeah. Yeah, I remembered
that just as I was saying...

12:24.090 --> 12:26.000
Thank you! I love it!

12:26.001 --> 12:27.769
- Sure.
- Got to go!

12:27.906 --> 12:29.106
Yeah.

12:29.830 --> 12:31.030
Denise is right.

12:31.031 --> 12:33.378
I can't tell Fozzie his girlfriend cheated.

12:33.379 --> 12:38.650
But, uh... hm, maybe I can help
him figure it out for himself, huh?

12:38.651 --> 12:39.876
Uh, what do you think, Sam?

12:40.257 --> 12:42.962
Hmm? Oh, I-I-I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.292
I-I thought you were doing one of

12:44.293 --> 12:46.470
- your silly...
- I wasn't doing an interview.

12:46.471 --> 12:48.840
Why isn't anybody listening to me? Yeesh!

12:48.978 --> 12:51.085
- Little old lady.
- Little old lady who?

12:51.086 --> 12:52.478
I didn't know you could yodel!

12:53.680 --> 12:56.025
- Uh, hey, Becky.
- Oh, hey, Kermit.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.136
Uh, yeah, hi there. Listen,
I ju... I just have to tell you

12:58.138 --> 13:00.768
how, um, impressive you were last night.

13:00.769 --> 13:03.203
- Oh.
- Uh, the only person I've ever met

13:03.204 --> 13:05.868
who knows as much about U.S.
history as you is my neighbor.

13:06.082 --> 13:09.424
Uh, he actually has an
American flag from 1853

13:09.425 --> 13:12.063
that has, um... how many stars, again?

13:12.064 --> 13:14.732
Ah! 31! I've been trying to get

13:14.733 --> 13:17.870
a line of historical-flag
clothing off the ground.

13:18.023 --> 13:19.177
My slogan?

13:19.178 --> 13:22.133
"The fashion is coming!
The fashion is coming!"

13:22.134 --> 13:23.786
Thank you very much,
Deadly. I appreciate that.

13:23.787 --> 13:26.264
But, um, I-I was actually
kind of talking to Becky here.

13:26.265 --> 13:27.465
It's 31.

13:27.466 --> 13:28.866
Yeah, well, I guess we all know that now.

13:28.867 --> 13:32.052
- All right, off to lunch!
- Uh...

13:32.164 --> 13:35.588
We're going to Café Paree!
That's French for Café Paris.

13:35.710 --> 13:37.914
- Yeah. Yeah, French, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

13:37.915 --> 13:40.493
Well, uh, you know, that...
that kind of reminds me,

13:40.494 --> 13:43.120
uh, I'm looking at some property
in, uh... in New Orleans.

13:43.121 --> 13:44.377
- Oh?
- Yeah. A-a-a-and

13:44.378 --> 13:45.814
I don't know much about the prices.

13:45.815 --> 13:49.686
So, ah, how much did we pay
France for the Louisiana purchase?

13:49.687 --> 13:51.292
- Um...
- I know the answer!

13:51.293 --> 13:52.915
Uh, yeah, I'm actually
having a private conversation

13:52.916 --> 13:55.061
- here, Carl.
- $15 million.

13:55.062 --> 13:57.290
That's 3 cents an acre.

13:57.644 --> 13:59.379
I'm kind of a Francophile.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.400
Yes, thanks very much, big mean Carl.

14:01.401 --> 14:06.476
Adjusted for inflation,
that's $236 million,

14:06.695 --> 14:09.890
or a little over 209 million Euros

14:09.891 --> 14:11.791
at today's exchange rate.

14:11.792 --> 14:14.636
Wow, Chip, that sounds like
a pretty good deal to me,

14:14.637 --> 14:17.005
considering it was how
many acres, only Becky?

14:18.774 --> 14:20.676
I said Becky, not Beaker!

14:20.677 --> 14:22.645
Well, he was correct. What do we win?

14:22.646 --> 14:24.001
W... nobody wins anything.

14:24.002 --> 14:25.993
These trivia questions
are supposed to be for her.

14:25.994 --> 14:27.683
Kermit, if you want to know the answers,

14:27.684 --> 14:29.949
why don't you just look
them up on your phone?

14:29.950 --> 14:32.791
Because I do not look
up answers on my phone

14:32.792 --> 14:35.614
like some people evidently do during
trivia night at Rowlf's Tavern!

14:35.615 --> 14:37.382
Who does that? I want names!

14:38.903 --> 14:42.094
I'm sorry, Fozzie, but
it was... it was Becky.

14:42.095 --> 14:43.033
Becky?

14:43.034 --> 14:44.644
- What?
- Oh, come on.

14:44.645 --> 14:46.029
Wait, you thought I was cheating?

14:46.030 --> 14:47.875
W-well, you were looking at your phone.

14:47.876 --> 14:51.512
Kermit, the only reason I was
on my phone is that I was eBay.

14:51.821 --> 14:53.350
- Huh?
- It was the end of an auction,

14:53.351 --> 14:55.438
and I was bidding on a gift for Fozzie.

14:55.621 --> 14:57.008
- Aww, really?
- Here.

14:57.009 --> 14:58.981
- Oh, no. I believe you.
- Look if you don't believe me.

14:58.982 --> 15:02.214
- Aww, it's a Fanny pack!
- Yeah.

15:02.215 --> 15:03.326
- And it's suede, so it won't
- No.

15:03.327 --> 15:04.533
irritate your belly plugs.

15:04.534 --> 15:07.538
Oh, Fozzie, Becky, I-I-I am so sorry.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.144
- I was just... I was just trying to...
- What?

15:09.145 --> 15:10.562
Call my girlfriend a cheater?

15:10.563 --> 15:12.427
- No! N-no!
- Come on, Becky.

15:12.491 --> 15:14.491
- No, Fozzie, Becky, please, wait!
- Let's go to lunch.

15:14.492 --> 15:16.688
I-It's just that when I...
when I saw the phone, guys,

15:16.689 --> 15:18.141
I-I thought that... g...

15:18.142 --> 15:19.568
I-I'm sorry.

15:22.048 --> 15:23.274
Oh...

15:24.067 --> 15:25.324
Hug?

15:26.235 --> 15:27.860
Please.

15:27.861 --> 15:30.606
Bring it in. There you go.

15:31.438 --> 15:33.283
Uh... uh, hiya, Chelsea.

15:33.284 --> 15:34.484
Scooter, hey!

15:34.832 --> 15:36.595
I was so relieved when I got your text.

15:36.596 --> 15:38.798
I thought maybe I had done
something to freak you out

15:38.799 --> 15:41.038
or had sent an inappropriate
picture of myself.

15:41.039 --> 15:43.907
Uh, yeah, you did. And
thank God my mom didn't see it.

15:44.042 --> 15:47.114
Listen, Chelsea, uh... I like you.

15:47.287 --> 15:52.160
I like you, too. Like, like you like you.

15:52.169 --> 15:53.369
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:53.370 --> 15:56.052
See, this is what's making my tummy hurt.

15:56.053 --> 15:59.067
You're a racy gal, which is
thrilling when you're on my TV.

15:59.265 --> 16:00.957
But in person, I can't just click over

16:00.958 --> 16:02.944
to the weather channel to catch my breath.

16:03.031 --> 16:04.332
I'm sorry.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.594
I get it.

16:06.392 --> 16:09.410
Scooter, you're the best thing that's
happened to me in a really long time.

16:09.411 --> 16:12.757
And if I move too fast, it's
because I-I don't want to lose you.

16:12.870 --> 16:16.051
I'm the kind of guy who needs
things to move a lot slower.

16:16.139 --> 16:17.406
Well, I can move slower.

16:17.407 --> 16:19.395
I can go back to my high-school moves.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.077
Yeah, maybe your junior-high-school moves.

16:23.685 --> 16:25.582
Listen, I'm going on the
road for a couple of weeks.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.270
Maybe we could just talk on the phone?

16:28.083 --> 16:30.452
Yeah. Yeah, you know what? I'd like that.

16:31.106 --> 16:33.903
- Hug?
- Yeah.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.253
Aww.

16:36.225 --> 16:38.330
Chelsea! No!

16:39.229 --> 16:41.886
- Why are there a number-two pencil?
- Huh.

16:41.887 --> 16:43.980
You know what I mean? Like,
why... why isn't one good enough?

16:43.981 --> 16:47.335
Hey, hey, hey. You all hip to
the word about Kermit and Fozzie?

16:47.336 --> 16:48.536
- Mnh-mnh.
- Mm-hmm.

16:48.537 --> 16:50.404
I heard they had an "alterfication"

16:50.405 --> 16:52.974
'cause the frog got with the bear's lady.

16:52.975 --> 16:54.580
Yeah, yeah. And I heard

16:54.581 --> 16:58.870
Fozzie was so angry,
he made Kermit disappear.

16:58.871 --> 17:00.946
Yeah. So the network replaced him

17:00.947 --> 17:02.795
with a robot Kermit.

17:02.796 --> 17:05.208
Whoa! Look at his eyes!

17:05.209 --> 17:08.175
- Robot Kermit has no soul!
- Mm.

17:08.176 --> 17:10.349
Whoa. I wonder if I'm a robot?

17:10.559 --> 17:12.523
Mm! Beep, bop, boop!

17:12.634 --> 17:15.342
Zzt, zzt, zzt, zzt!

17:15.430 --> 17:17.568
Oh! That came way too easily.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.929
All right! Let's knock out
these regional promos, friends...

17:20.930 --> 17:22.517
- Yeah.
- ...and Kermit.

17:22.518 --> 17:23.938
Fozzie, I said I was sorry.

17:23.939 --> 17:25.476
- So! Which city's up first?
- Come on. I...

17:25.477 --> 17:28.521
Okay. Well, first up,
Philadelphia. In three...

17:28.521 --> 17:30.552
- Here you go.
- ...two...

17:30.553 --> 17:32.599
Stay tuned for electrifying comedy

17:32.600 --> 17:34.380
in the city of brotherly love!

17:34.381 --> 17:36.387
"Up Late with Miss Piggy" is on next!

17:36.388 --> 17:37.648
- Very nice.
- Good one.

17:37.649 --> 17:38.963
You wouldn't know
anything about the city of

17:38.964 --> 17:40.459
- brotherly love, Kermit.
- What?

17:40.460 --> 17:42.293
Probably because you live in the city of

17:42.294 --> 17:44.478
meddling in somebody else's relationship.

17:44.479 --> 17:47.453
Mm, based on my experience, that's Reno.

17:47.454 --> 17:48.979
I mean, honestly, Kermit...

17:48.980 --> 17:51.286
- Memphis in three... two...
- ...what do you have against Becky?

17:51.287 --> 17:52.735
- Nothing!
- Howdy, Memphis!

17:52.736 --> 17:55.182
Watch "Up Late with Miss
Piggy," coming up next.

17:55.183 --> 17:56.927
Thank ya! Thank ya very much!

17:56.928 --> 17:58.559
If you don't have anything against Becky,

17:58.560 --> 18:01.326
- then what is it?
- Look, I-I'm just not sure

18:01.327 --> 18:03.180
that you're ready to move in with anybody,

18:03.181 --> 18:05.749
- Fozzie.
- Ready? Why not? I'm an adult.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.351
Oh, wait a minute. You
don't think I'm an adult,

18:08.352 --> 18:10.295
- Oh, no, it's not...
- do you? You don't think I'm mature

18:10.296 --> 18:13.013
- enough. Well, I am mature, so...
- Yeah.

18:13.014 --> 18:15.287
- ...nyaaaah to you!
- Fozzie...

18:15.288 --> 18:16.951
You don't have to watch out for me.

18:16.952 --> 18:19.678
I'm not the junior
partner in this friendship.

18:19.679 --> 18:22.509
- I'm a co-president! And I own stock...
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:22.510 --> 18:24.938
- ...and have a corner office... and...
- Yeah.

18:25.498 --> 18:28.926
- Ahh, my metaphor's falling apart.
- Fozzie, I hope you know

18:28.927 --> 18:31.049
that I've always tried to
look out for you in the past.

18:31.050 --> 18:33.561
Well  I appreciate that, but...

18:33.562 --> 18:35.720
- Mm?
- ...You don't have to anymore.

18:35.721 --> 18:38.290
I-I-I want you to see me
as someone you respect.

18:38.378 --> 18:39.987
Someone you can take seriously...

18:39.988 --> 18:41.822
that was not the time to do that.

18:41.823 --> 18:44.817
Oh, sorry. We're just trying to
get to our affiliate in Minnesota.

18:44.818 --> 18:46.305
You're right, Fozzie.

18:46.306 --> 18:48.588
Er, from now on, you
make your own decisions.

18:48.589 --> 18:52.056
And if you want my advice,
I'm always here for ya.

18:52.057 --> 18:54.836
- I know that, Kermit. Thanks.
- Mm?

18:54.837 --> 18:58.385
You're welcome. So, uh,
when's Becky moving in?

18:58.386 --> 19:00.255
Oh, that? No, that's off.

19:00.256 --> 19:01.507
- Mm?
- I never asked her. Way

19:01.508 --> 19:04.151
too big of a step. You
can't rush these things.

19:04.152 --> 19:06.899
- Yeah...
- Can I get a fan in here? I'm boiling.

19:06.900 --> 19:09.752
You got to love Fozzie. And it's his life.

19:09.753 --> 19:12.124
I got to trust him to
make his own decisions.

19:12.125 --> 19:15.575
But I'd be lying if I said I
wasn't gonna keep an eye on him.

19:15.576 --> 19:17.023
It's... I'm stuck.

19:17.024 --> 19:19.098
- I-I-I'm stuck here, guys.
- Y-y-you getting it? You getting it?

19:19.099 --> 19:20.532
- Oh, yes.
- Whoa!

19:20.533 --> 19:21.793
Hey, Fozzie... uh, why don't

19:21.794 --> 19:23.135
- Yeah?
- you just take off the hat?

19:23.136 --> 19:24.752
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

19:26.089 --> 19:27.789
Thanks, Kermit. That worked.

19:27.795 --> 19:29.420
- Sure.
- Huh, ha!

19:31.184 --> 19:32.384
Party pooper.

19:34.456 --> 19:36.343
Oh, wow! There's Kermit!

19:36.344 --> 19:38.259
Yeah. And I got a plan

19:38.260 --> 19:41.286
to find out if he's a
robot once and for all.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.397
- _

19:42.398 --> 19:44.518
- Hmm.
- Up Late With Miss Piggy... one...

19:46.668 --> 19:48.235
Mmph, yeah.

19:49.603 --> 19:52.819
Well, there's our answer.
Science has spoken.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.174
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

19:54.175 --> 19:55.514
- Om-nom-nom!
- Whoa!

19:55.515 --> 19:58.259
Nom-nom-nom! Mmm!

19:58.345 --> 20:01.281
Whoa! Animal's a robot!

20:01.282 --> 20:02.972
Well, that explains a lot.

20:02.973 --> 20:06.452
Yeah! Like why he makes
such a fuss at bath time!

20:06.453 --> 20:08.788
Doesn't change anything.
He's still a beautiful soul.

20:08.789 --> 20:10.187
Yum! Yum! Yum!

20:10.590 --> 20:11.857
Hey, guys!

20:11.858 --> 20:13.459
Ohhh, the robot's comin!

20:13.527 --> 20:15.795
Disperse! Disperse!

20:15.796 --> 20:18.306
I'm running away, but I still love you!

20:18.532 --> 20:20.533
Oh, well. More for me!

20:20.601 --> 20:21.934
Om-nom-nom!
