WEBVTT

00:00.647 --> 00:03.411
Do not try
any of the experiments

00:03.483 --> 00:05.917
you are about to see at home.

00:05.986 --> 00:09.387
You heard him.
Don't do it.

00:12.059 --> 00:15.153
NARRATOR: On this extra-sticky
episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:15.228 --> 00:16.216
ADAM:
This will be, by far,

00:16.296 --> 00:18.321
the strangest thing
we have ever done.

00:18.398 --> 00:20.559
NARRATOR:
Adam and Jamie strip down

00:20.634 --> 00:22.499
to test a classic
physics conundrum...

00:22.569 --> 00:25.663
ADAM: Ohh!
Oh, holy crap, that is slippery!

00:25.739 --> 00:27.832
NARRATOR: Can you swim
just as fast in syrup

00:27.908 --> 00:29.307
as you can in water?

00:30.277 --> 00:31.744
Oh, my God, look at you.

00:31.812 --> 00:33.871
NARRATOR:
While Tory, Grant, and Kari

00:33.947 --> 00:36.040
put the bite
on two bullet myths.

00:36.116 --> 00:38.414
Your mom is in my head, and
she's saying, "Don't do that."

00:40.287 --> 00:43.779
NARRATOR: Could Davy Crockett
really split a lead slug

00:43.857 --> 00:45.222
on an ax blade?

00:45.292 --> 00:46.657
That is crazy.
Look at that.

00:46.727 --> 00:49.025
NARRATOR: And could MacGyver
blow open a steel door

00:49.096 --> 00:52.691
with a gun butt
and the powder from six bullets?

00:53.734 --> 00:55.725
- Brace yourself.
- Fire in the hole!

00:55.802 --> 00:57.667
This will not be pretty.

01:02.809 --> 01:05.607
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:05.679 --> 01:06.737
Adam Savage...

01:06.813 --> 01:08.872
Don't lick the mixing spoon!

01:08.949 --> 01:09.973
NARRATOR:
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:10.050 --> 01:12.382
When in doubt, C-4!

01:12.452 --> 01:14.147
NARRATOR:
Between them, more than 30 years

01:14.221 --> 01:16.121
of special-effects experience.

01:16.189 --> 01:17.850
The timing was perfect.

01:17.924 --> 01:20.518
NARRATOR:
Joining them... Kari Byron...

01:20.594 --> 01:21.526
That was a rush!

01:21.595 --> 01:23.426
- NARRATOR: Grant lmahara...
- Let's get it on!

01:23.497 --> 01:25.294
NARRATOR:
...and Tory Belleci.

01:25.365 --> 01:26.662
I'm alive!

01:26.733 --> 01:29.167
NARRATOR:
They don't just tell the myths.

01:29.236 --> 01:32.069
They put them to the test.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

01:47.554 --> 01:49.112
So, I see swim goggles.

01:49.189 --> 01:52.420
I see a swim cap,
and I see syrup.

01:52.492 --> 01:54.824
I'm sensing a really big mess
in our future.

01:54.895 --> 01:57.955
Am I right?
Oh, you are correct.

01:58.031 --> 02:00.124
This is a classic
physics thought experiment.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.600
Simply stated, it is thus...

02:02.669 --> 02:05.103
that you can swim as fast
in syrup

02:05.172 --> 02:07.402
as you can in regular old water.

02:07.474 --> 02:09.738
Well, the syrup is thicker,
so I would think that it would

02:09.810 --> 02:11.710
slow down your movement
through it.

02:11.778 --> 02:14.178
That might be true,
but it also might be true

02:14.247 --> 02:15.441
that the thicker syrup

02:15.515 --> 02:18.416
gives you more
to push against with your hands.

02:18.485 --> 02:20.419
So, what this boils
down to, then,

02:20.487 --> 02:23.684
is whether those two forces
cancel each other out, right?

02:23.757 --> 02:25.884
That's what we got to get down
and dirty and test.

02:25.959 --> 02:26.948
NARRATOR:
On the surface,

02:27.027 --> 02:28.756
you'd think
that swimming in syrup

02:28.829 --> 02:31.457
could only end
with drowning in syrup,

02:31.531 --> 02:33.396
but maybe not.

02:33.467 --> 02:35.697
The thick resistance
that slows you down

02:35.769 --> 02:38.363
might also mean
you've got more to push against,

02:38.438 --> 02:40.235
increasing your propulsion.

02:40.307 --> 02:43.674
Like Adam says,
it's a classic physics dilemma,

02:43.743 --> 02:46.803
and we'll be testing it
with real swimmers.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.245
Sweet.

02:48.315 --> 02:50.875
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say we need to get a pool,

02:50.951 --> 02:53.249
a bunch of syrup,
and start testing.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.481
You're right, but with
two notable exceptions.

02:55.555 --> 02:57.079
One, we're not gonna use
real maple syrup.

02:57.157 --> 02:58.385
We're going to use guar gum,

02:58.458 --> 03:01.552
which should allow us to get
exactly the viscosity we want.

03:01.628 --> 03:03.653
Two, we couldn't find a pool

03:03.730 --> 03:05.595
that would allow us
to fill it with syrup.

03:05.665 --> 03:06.689
We're gonna have to make
our own.

03:06.766 --> 03:09.030
In fact, I propose we make
two pools...

03:09.102 --> 03:11.832
one filled with water,
one filled with heavy syrup.

03:11.905 --> 03:14.237
Swim in each
and compare our times.

03:14.307 --> 03:15.535
It's that simple.

03:15.609 --> 03:17.873
Well, let's dive right in.

03:17.944 --> 03:19.434
Okay!

03:24.317 --> 03:26.308
Well, this may look like
just a clearing

03:26.386 --> 03:28.513
in the hills of
Dublin-Pleasanton, California,

03:28.588 --> 03:30.647
but by the time
we're done with it,

03:30.724 --> 03:32.919
by the end of the day,
when we're through

03:32.993 --> 03:36.156
digging a pair of 75-foot-long
pools with these puppies,

03:36.229 --> 03:38.356
this will be
an experimental space

03:38.431 --> 03:40.661
on the leading edge
of fluid dynamics,

03:40.734 --> 03:43.259
swimming, and goo.

03:43.336 --> 03:46.134
NARRATOR: Before they tackle
the swimming or the science,

03:46.206 --> 03:49.300
the boys need to show
their blue-collar credentials.

03:49.376 --> 03:51.401
And what do you know?

03:51.478 --> 03:53.969
It's poetry in motion.

04:04.824 --> 04:07.292
ADAM: We are now about to line
these in heavy plastic

04:07.360 --> 04:08.850
and fill them with water.

04:08.929 --> 04:10.487
And we're using four layers
of heavy plastic,

04:10.564 --> 04:12.225
hopefully to keep any leaks
from happening.

04:12.299 --> 04:15.200
We've tried to eliminate as many
sharp objects on the bottom.

04:15.268 --> 04:16.632
Perfect.

04:16.702 --> 04:17.795
ADAM: Ha ha!

04:18.939 --> 04:21.430
Wow!
It's freakin' dark in here!

04:21.507 --> 04:22.873
JAMIE:
Okay, everybody just stay put.

04:22.943 --> 04:25.377
Make sure you hang on
to your edges.

04:25.445 --> 04:26.673
We're ready for water.

04:26.746 --> 04:28.907
[Siren wailing]

04:28.982 --> 04:32.941
NARRATOR: An Alameda County
fire truck pumps the water.

04:35.422 --> 04:36.980
And the plastic lining,

04:37.057 --> 04:39.321
bolstered by some
hefty plywood decking,

04:39.392 --> 04:41.053
seems to be holding.

04:41.127 --> 04:43.425
Oh, it's turned out to be
a heck of a pool.

04:43.496 --> 04:45.794
ADAM:
Dude, this thing looks awesome.

04:45.865 --> 04:48.390
Dig a hole, you got some
plastic, you got a pool, huh?

04:48.468 --> 04:49.992
[Laughs]

04:50.070 --> 04:51.970
Ah, well,
if the other trench is ready,

04:52.038 --> 04:53.630
let's make some goo and fill it.

04:53.707 --> 04:54.674
JAMIE: Okay.

04:54.741 --> 04:58.768
NARRATOR: It's time
to get sticky for science.

05:06.653 --> 05:08.416
- What is it?
- All right.

05:08.488 --> 05:10.149
MacGyver is on a cargo ship.

05:10.223 --> 05:11.281
He's trying to rescue a boy

05:11.358 --> 05:13.155
who's locked behind
a steel door.

05:13.226 --> 05:15.854
He empties out six bullets
and ignites the gunpowder

05:15.929 --> 05:20.423
using an empty cartridge,
and then blows the lock open.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.798
[Scoffs] I wouldn't have
thought of that one.

05:24.270 --> 05:27.205
NARRATOR: Mac's method is to
pack the powder from six bullets

05:27.273 --> 05:28.968
inside a shred of cloth.

05:29.042 --> 05:32.569
He stuffs that in the lock,
shoves in an empty cartridge,

05:32.646 --> 05:36.480
and smacks the firing cap
with the butt of his gun.

05:37.617 --> 05:40.916
Hang on. I thought MacGyver
had an extreme aversion to guns.

05:40.987 --> 05:43.649
True. He took a .38
from a guard he'd just K.O.'d.

05:43.723 --> 05:45.122
But let's not forget.

05:45.191 --> 05:47.182
There's a child's life
at stake here.

05:47.260 --> 05:48.386
Sorry.
Forgot that.

05:48.461 --> 05:49.951
But, still, it's a loaded gun.

05:50.030 --> 05:52.396
Why wouldn't he just point it
at the lock and shoot it out?

05:52.465 --> 05:54.763
Well, he thought it would
ricochet straight back

05:54.834 --> 05:56.233
off a steel door.

05:56.302 --> 05:57.599
So, what do you guys think?

05:57.671 --> 05:59.366
I say let's give it a try.

05:59.439 --> 06:00.701
Let's do it.

06:03.243 --> 06:05.837
NARRATOR: It's unusual for us
to start testing a myth

06:05.912 --> 06:07.470
with an alternate method,

06:07.547 --> 06:09.981
but this really is
the elephant in the room.

06:10.050 --> 06:13.042
KARI: If I had only a gun
to unlock a door,

06:13.119 --> 06:14.814
Personally,
I would try shooting it

06:14.888 --> 06:17.288
before I would even remotely
think of MacGyver's method.

06:17.357 --> 06:20.224
So, I guess we'll see
if he made the wise choice.

06:20.293 --> 06:23.353
NARRATOR: Grant and Tory
fix the gun just a foot shy

06:23.430 --> 06:27.491
of a similar lock
stuck inside a solid steel door.

06:27.567 --> 06:31.435
For safety's sake, they've set
up the rig inside the bunker.

06:31.504 --> 06:32.994
All right, we're hot.

06:33.073 --> 06:34.540
We're cocked.
We're loaded.

06:34.607 --> 06:35.596
Let's get out of here.

06:35.675 --> 06:38.769
NARRATOR: Even in the drizzle,
they're better off out than in.

06:38.845 --> 06:40.142
TORY:
Here we go.

06:40.213 --> 06:43.080
In 3... 2... 1.

06:44.651 --> 06:47.119
Ooh, that was a good one!

06:48.488 --> 06:51.218
NARRATOR: Turns out it was
much more than a good one.

06:51.291 --> 06:54.522
This lock was cracked
with the very first bullet.

06:54.594 --> 06:57.028
We punched a hole
in the face of that lock.

06:57.097 --> 06:59.258
- What?
- KARI: Is it open?

06:59.332 --> 07:00.765
[Laughs]

07:00.834 --> 07:03.860
- I don't accept that.
- We got it open in one shot!

07:03.937 --> 07:07.373
- Are you sure it was locked?
- I am positive it was locked.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.806
I... I don't know what to say.

07:09.876 --> 07:11.537
This never happens to us.

07:11.611 --> 07:15.775
I fully expected us to be here
all day, round after round,

07:15.849 --> 07:18.340
bouncing off the top
or denting it.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.384
NARRATOR: But Mac took a leaf
from our book,

07:22.455 --> 07:25.618
using materials in ways
that were never intended.

07:25.692 --> 07:28.388
Now, before we jump
straight to the big bang,

07:28.461 --> 07:30.486
let's test his prep.

07:30.563 --> 07:34.522
First up, can you pull a bullet
apart with your fingers?

07:34.601 --> 07:38.162
But he is MacGyver.
He has the strength of 20 men.

07:38.238 --> 07:39.466
[Laughs]

07:39.539 --> 07:40.767
NARRATOR:
Apparently not.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.808
Tory has the Zen-like patience

07:42.876 --> 07:46.209
of a 3-year-old
unwrapping a birthday present.

07:46.279 --> 07:47.371
Okay, right now,

07:47.447 --> 07:49.745
your mom is in my head, and
she's saying, "Don't do that."

07:49.816 --> 07:52.148
NARRATOR:
So that's just Hollywood hokum.

07:52.218 --> 07:53.879
Aah!

07:55.555 --> 07:57.887
NARRATOR: What about setting off
a firing cap

07:57.957 --> 08:00.721
with the broad butt of a .38?

08:01.361 --> 08:04.159
Okay, so, we need to test
this MacGyver scene.

08:04.230 --> 08:07.757
We need to find out if you can
set off one of these caps

08:07.834 --> 08:08.994
by hitting it with a gun.

08:09.068 --> 08:10.831
All right.
This should be fun.

08:10.904 --> 08:13.771
NARRATOR: Our guys are
dedicated, but not insane.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.003
These cartridges have all been
emptied of gunpowder.

08:17.076 --> 08:18.441
- Ready.
- Set.

08:18.511 --> 08:19.739
Go.

08:21.614 --> 08:24.344
Now, I know it looks like
we're having a lot of fun,

08:24.417 --> 08:25.748
but this is very dangerous.

08:25.819 --> 08:27.446
We're taking all the precautions
to make sure

08:27.520 --> 08:29.215
everything is done safely.

08:29.289 --> 08:31.621
Nobody should ever try

08:31.691 --> 08:33.385
setting off a bullet
outside of a gun.

08:33.458 --> 08:36.360
NARRATOR: It's a bust
for Mac's ignition system.

08:36.429 --> 08:39.421
Now [chuckles]
I don't know about yours,

08:39.499 --> 08:40.864
but I flattened the crap
out of mine,

08:40.933 --> 08:43.095
and it still didn't go off.

08:43.169 --> 08:44.534
Why is that?

08:44.604 --> 08:46.868
NARRATOR: That's because
this tiny firing cap,

08:46.940 --> 08:48.635
flush to the back
of the cartridge,

08:48.708 --> 08:50.801
is designed to be
struck precisely

08:50.877 --> 08:54.142
by an equally tiny firing pin.

08:54.814 --> 08:56.247
So, for our testing,

08:56.316 --> 09:00.184
Kari fits a similar pin
in the base of the gun grip.

09:00.253 --> 09:03.051
Grant builds a simple rig
to swing the gun

09:03.122 --> 09:05.989
to smash the cap
to ignite the powder.

09:06.059 --> 09:07.993
- GRANT: Ba-bang.
- TORY: Bang.

09:08.061 --> 09:10.393
That is gonna be awesome.

09:10.463 --> 09:12.988
NARRATOR: But just how much
gunpowder do you get

09:13.066 --> 09:14.328
from six bullets?

09:14.400 --> 09:16.925
Okay, so,
that amount of gunpowder

09:17.003 --> 09:19.403
is only 30 grains.

09:19.472 --> 09:20.769
That's not a lot.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.398
Let me show you
how much that is.

09:24.811 --> 09:27.974
That is all we have to work with
to blow this lock up.

09:28.047 --> 09:29.537
I don't know
if this is gonna work.

09:31.284 --> 09:33.411
ADAM: It's time to fill our pool
with syrup,

09:33.486 --> 09:36.080
and the role of syrup today
will be played by guar gum.

09:36.155 --> 09:38.521
It's a powdered food thickener,

09:38.591 --> 09:41.458
and somehow we've got to make
750 pounds of it

09:41.527 --> 09:43.256
with 10,000 gallons of water,

09:43.329 --> 09:45.456
and that's
where this truck comes in.

09:45.531 --> 09:47.897
Amazingly,
it is uniquely custom built

09:47.967 --> 09:49.730
for mixing guar gum with water.

09:51.070 --> 09:53.800
So, if I'm correct, you place
a 50-pound bag right here,

09:53.873 --> 09:55.670
slice open the end,
and it dumps in right there?

09:55.742 --> 09:56.902
Exactly right.

09:56.976 --> 09:59.137
Have you ever mixed up
a guar-gum mixture

09:59.212 --> 10:00.236
this thick before?

10:00.313 --> 10:02.076
We've never mixed it
this thick before.

10:02.148 --> 10:03.479
We're not even sure
if it'll pump.

10:03.549 --> 10:06.677
NARRATOR: Well, it's better
breaking their toys than ours,

10:06.753 --> 10:08.186
and let's remember
that Adam and Jamie

10:08.254 --> 10:10.916
will soon be swimming in this.

10:10.990 --> 10:13.220
I'll swim first,
if you don't mind.

10:13.293 --> 10:15.090
There's your starting pistol.

10:15.161 --> 10:16.822
There's your timer.

10:16.896 --> 10:18.659
And, uh...

10:18.731 --> 10:20.995
These things are so comfy
I've been wearing mine all day.

10:21.067 --> 10:22.534
[Chuckles]

10:22.602 --> 10:25.935
NARRATOR: Jamie averts his eyes
and bites his tongue,

10:26.005 --> 10:27.836
knowing he'll be the next man

10:27.907 --> 10:31.172
stripping down
to his racing undies.

10:31.244 --> 10:33.712
All right!

10:33.780 --> 10:35.111
Let's go!

10:35.181 --> 10:36.546
JAMIE:
On your mark.

10:37.684 --> 10:39.174
Ready.

10:39.252 --> 10:40.981
[Gunshot]

10:41.054 --> 10:44.023
NARRATOR: This is the first
of three freshwater sprints.

10:44.090 --> 10:45.455
They'll average out the times

10:45.525 --> 10:48.494
for a comparison
to swimming in syrup.

10:49.062 --> 10:50.757
15.72.

10:50.830 --> 10:53.025
I'll bet I'll do faster
the second time.

10:53.099 --> 10:55.897
Just got to get used to swimming
in such a narrow channel.

10:58.171 --> 11:00.230
NARRATOR: It really doesn't
matter how fast he swims,

11:00.306 --> 11:03.707
so long as they get
a good set of numbers.

11:03.776 --> 11:05.403
14.78.

11:05.979 --> 11:07.970
[Gunshot]

11:08.047 --> 11:09.844
NARRATOR:
But Adam just can't resist

11:09.916 --> 11:12.282
showing off for the ladies.

11:12.352 --> 11:13.910
A little bit quicker each time.

11:13.987 --> 11:15.477
14.62.

11:15.555 --> 11:16.579
Do you want to go?

11:16.656 --> 11:18.647
- Did you pee in the pool?
- I did not.

11:18.725 --> 11:20.852
NARRATOR: And that's
good enough for Jamie.

11:20.927 --> 11:25.296
He dons the cap and goggles
and hands the gun to Adam.

11:25.365 --> 11:27.060
I got to say, I feel less
like a swimming coach

11:27.133 --> 11:30.227
than a guy defending his house
in the middle of the night.

11:30.303 --> 11:32.863
You kids get off my lawn!

11:32.939 --> 11:35.066
[Gunshot]

11:35.141 --> 11:38.577
NARRATOR: Jamie proves to be
more of a distance swimmer,

11:38.644 --> 11:40.874
but, again,
speed isn't the issue.

11:40.947 --> 11:42.278
JAMIE:
What kind of a swimmer am I?

11:42.348 --> 11:44.373
Well, I'm not very fast.

11:44.450 --> 11:46.975
I get the job done.
That's about it.

11:47.053 --> 11:48.816
[Gunshot]

11:50.690 --> 11:51.884
ADAM: 24.

11:51.958 --> 11:54.085
NARRATOR: And now they're ready
to swim in something

11:54.160 --> 11:55.855
that's more like treacle.

11:55.928 --> 11:59.625
This stuff is
1,500 times thicker than water.

11:59.699 --> 12:00.961
JAMIE:
I know what you're thinking...

12:01.034 --> 12:02.729
"Of course you're gonna
swim slower in syrup

12:02.802 --> 12:04.292
than you are in regular water."

12:04.370 --> 12:06.964
But what if you get
more purchase

12:07.040 --> 12:10.806
on your paddling hands and so on
in something that's thicker?

12:10.877 --> 12:12.742
NARRATOR:
And here's another thought...

12:12.812 --> 12:16.339
molecular bonds in syrup like
this are constantly changing.

12:16.416 --> 12:19.476
It all depends on
the temperature and the speed

12:19.552 --> 12:23.579
and the shape of a body moving
through the liquid.

12:23.656 --> 12:26.181
JAMIE:
What is happening in syrup

12:26.259 --> 12:29.251
is that we have things
known as polymer chains.

12:29.328 --> 12:31.592
They're long strings
of molecules

12:31.664 --> 12:34.690
that basically
are like spaghetti noodles,

12:34.767 --> 12:37.031
like cooked spaghetti noodles,
and they stick together.

12:37.103 --> 12:38.229
When they soak up water,

12:38.304 --> 12:40.829
you've got these bunches
of these polymer chains,

12:40.907 --> 12:43.933
and depending on the speed
that you move through them,

12:44.010 --> 12:48.572
depending on their thickness and
what exactly they're made of,

12:48.648 --> 12:50.343
they can either just part

12:50.416 --> 12:53.579
and let you go
through this mix like water,

12:53.653 --> 12:54.950
or they can bunch up.

12:55.021 --> 12:58.013
They can become something like
the La Brea tar pits.

12:58.091 --> 12:59.615
There's all sorts
of different ways

12:59.692 --> 13:02.422
that these can end up
affecting you

13:02.495 --> 13:03.826
as you're swimming in them.

13:05.364 --> 13:06.388
NARRATOR:
Jamie's right.

13:06.466 --> 13:09.401
It's almost impossible to
untangle the molecular physics

13:09.469 --> 13:13.200
of Newtonian fluids
from Einsteinian viscosity.

13:13.272 --> 13:16.400
But Adam has
a very prosaic prediction.

13:16.476 --> 13:18.740
Honestly,
I don't see it happening.

13:18.811 --> 13:20.676
That stuff
is just too darn thick.

13:20.746 --> 13:23.613
I think the difference
we'll be seeing is much greater,

13:23.683 --> 13:28.677
on the order of like 30%, 40%,
like 5, 6, 8 seconds difference.

13:28.754 --> 13:31.279
NARRATOR: Adam is the first
to see if swimming in syrup

13:31.357 --> 13:34.121
is faster
than his freshwater freestyle.

13:34.193 --> 13:35.717
Ohh!

13:35.795 --> 13:37.763
[Laughing]

13:40.566 --> 13:43.399
Oh, holy crap, that is slippery!

13:47.073 --> 13:50.338
NARRATOR: He looks fast,
but those resounding plops

13:50.409 --> 13:52.969
tell a different story.

13:53.813 --> 13:55.644
18.62.

13:55.715 --> 13:57.546
That was respectably close.

13:57.617 --> 13:59.209
That's not that much different.

13:59.285 --> 14:02.220
That's only about
3 seconds or so slower.

14:03.389 --> 14:06.552
This stuff feels
completely bizarre.

14:08.294 --> 14:10.728
Oh, it's like being born again.

14:10.796 --> 14:12.263
[Laughs]

14:13.366 --> 14:16.233
NARRATOR:
So let's get born again again...

14:20.540 --> 14:22.599
18.94.

14:22.675 --> 14:23.937
NARRATOR:
...and again.

14:24.010 --> 14:25.307
[Gunshot]

14:32.451 --> 14:34.419
JAMIE: Well, your slowest times
are faster

14:34.487 --> 14:36.250
than my fastest times in water.

14:36.322 --> 14:37.721
ADAM: [Laughs]

14:37.790 --> 14:39.985
NARRATOR: And there's
more good news to come.

14:40.059 --> 14:42.391
Adam's average freshwater times

14:42.461 --> 14:45.362
weren't that much different
to swimming in syrup.

14:45.431 --> 14:48.491
I'm really surprised
how fast I was able to go.

14:48.568 --> 14:50.365
I would've thought
the syrup would slow me down

14:50.436 --> 14:54.873
by, like, a factor of 2,
not by a factor of .2.

14:55.441 --> 14:57.671
NARRATOR: But we'd like
two sets of figures.

14:57.743 --> 15:02.703
Time for Jamie to dip his doodle
in that cold, cold sludge.

15:03.883 --> 15:05.373
[Laughs]

15:05.451 --> 15:07.715
Ready... set...

15:07.787 --> 15:09.755
[Gunshot]

15:09.822 --> 15:11.949
JAMIE: I actually kind of like
this stuff.

15:12.024 --> 15:13.821
It's kind of cozy in here.

15:13.893 --> 15:15.986
But swimming in it?

15:16.062 --> 15:18.360
Not so much.

15:18.431 --> 15:20.023
No friggin' way!

15:20.099 --> 15:21.532
ADAM: Really?

15:21.601 --> 15:24.126
This is much heavier to me.

15:24.203 --> 15:25.932
I found that swimming
in this stuff

15:26.005 --> 15:28.064
made me a lot more tired
than swimming in water.

15:33.079 --> 15:35.343
[Breathing heavily]

15:38.951 --> 15:40.543
That looked like a lot of work.

15:42.355 --> 15:44.448
NARRATOR:
So, Jamie officially retires

15:44.523 --> 15:46.718
from competitive syrup swimming.

15:46.792 --> 15:49.989
We'll be using Adam's averages
to make the comparisons.

15:50.062 --> 15:51.222
[Laughs]

15:51.297 --> 15:52.389
You all right?

15:52.465 --> 15:53.489
I'm fine.

15:53.566 --> 15:55.397
I'm just glad
I didn't fall in there.

15:55.468 --> 15:56.560
JAMIE: Yeah.

15:59.472 --> 16:01.872
NARRATOR: Tory, Grant, and Kari
are ready to test

16:01.941 --> 16:04.307
if TV legend Angus MacGyver

16:04.377 --> 16:07.835
could possibly have blown
the lock on a steel door

16:07.913 --> 16:10.973
using only loose gunpowder,
an empty cartridge,

16:11.050 --> 16:12.950
and the butt of his gun.

16:13.853 --> 16:15.320
KARI: We're back
at the Alameda bomb range,

16:15.388 --> 16:16.753
which is one of our
favorite places to go

16:16.822 --> 16:18.813
because we can do all the things
that we can't do in the shop,

16:18.891 --> 16:21.291
like blow doors open
with gunpowder.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.294
Get in there!

16:26.098 --> 16:27.998
Somebody go get MacGyver!

16:28.067 --> 16:30.797
All right, so, that is 30 grains
of smokeless powder.

16:30.870 --> 16:32.030
GRANT:
That's six bullets' worth?

16:32.104 --> 16:33.799
TORY: Yeah, I know.
Doesn't look like much.

16:33.873 --> 16:35.602
Do you think
that's gonna blow the lock open?

16:35.675 --> 16:36.937
Hey, it worked for MacGyver.

16:37.009 --> 16:38.476
Yeah, I doubt it.

16:38.544 --> 16:39.977
I think the hardest part
is gonna be

16:40.046 --> 16:41.035
getting that into the lock.

16:41.113 --> 16:42.603
I know.

16:42.682 --> 16:44.149
All right, let's do it.

16:44.216 --> 16:47.583
NARRATOR: Kari does manage
to stuff the cloth in the lock.

16:47.653 --> 16:50.588
That's the first real thumbs-up
for this myth.

16:50.656 --> 16:52.419
Okay, that should be it.

16:52.491 --> 16:55.085
NARRATOR: Then the boys attach
Grant's custom rig

16:55.161 --> 16:57.186
to the doorframe.

16:57.263 --> 16:59.390
GRANT: So, our lock
is right behind here.

16:59.465 --> 17:02.832
It's got the bit of bandana
with the powder in it.

17:02.902 --> 17:09.137
This is our cap, and this is
our mechanism to swing the gun.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.233
It's a little more complicated
than just hitting it,

17:11.310 --> 17:14.973
but for safety's sake, we need
something to do it remotely.

17:15.047 --> 17:16.445
TORY: Do you want to put tension
on the string,

17:16.515 --> 17:17.539
see if it holds up?

17:17.616 --> 17:19.880
GRANT:
Yeah. Go ahead.

17:19.952 --> 17:21.852
Perfect.

17:21.921 --> 17:24.219
Okay, this is
"MacGyver Gunpowder in Lock,"

17:24.290 --> 17:25.655
test one.

17:25.724 --> 17:27.852
You guys ready to have
your minds blown?

17:27.926 --> 17:29.827
Yeah.
Here we go.

17:29.895 --> 17:32.864
In 3... 2... 1!

17:34.767 --> 17:38.134
NARRATOR:
No smoke, no fire, and no boom.

17:38.204 --> 17:40.672
I realize the earplugs
are more for your countdown

17:40.740 --> 17:42.105
than the actual popping.

17:42.174 --> 17:43.334
GRANT: [Laughs]

17:43.409 --> 17:46.037
NARRATOR: The pin on
the gun grip did strike the cap,

17:46.112 --> 17:48.444
but it didn't ignite the powder.

17:48.514 --> 17:50.004
Yeah, it went off,
but the powder didn't.

17:50.082 --> 17:51.276
So, what's the next step?

17:51.350 --> 17:53.284
The obvious thing
is that the cap is not coming

17:53.352 --> 17:55.411
into contact with the powder
because of the cloth.

17:55.488 --> 17:57.217
Maybe what we do
is we put a hole in the cloth

17:57.289 --> 17:59.883
so that we have the cap
in contact with the powder.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.449
All right.
Well, let's give that a shot.

18:01.527 --> 18:03.825
NARRATOR: So Tory sensibly
spreads the gunpowder

18:03.896 --> 18:06.387
all the way back
to the ignition cap.

18:06.465 --> 18:10.299
GRANT: Here we go.
3... 2... 1.

18:11.537 --> 18:13.528
NARRATOR:
Silence is deafening.

18:13.606 --> 18:16.234
Mac's mini-hostage
wouldn't even know

18:16.308 --> 18:17.707
that someone
was trying to rescue him.

18:17.777 --> 18:18.869
TORY:
It didn't ignite the powder,

18:18.944 --> 18:20.639
and that was in contact
with the cap.

18:20.713 --> 18:22.738
I'm starting to think
that, no matter what,

18:22.815 --> 18:25.375
a cap going off isn't gonna
ignite the gunpowder.

18:25.451 --> 18:26.748
NARRATOR:
But Grant has found a loophole

18:26.819 --> 18:31.017
that might just save this stunt
and salvage Mac's reputation.

18:31.090 --> 18:33.183
GRANT: Now, the type
of gunpowder that we're using

18:33.259 --> 18:36.387
is smokeless gunpowder, which is
found in modern ammunition.

18:36.462 --> 18:39.829
But at one time,
the .38-caliber round

18:39.899 --> 18:41.127
had black powder,

18:41.200 --> 18:44.169
which has a bit more punch
than the smokeless.

18:47.006 --> 18:49.668
My prediction is,
this is not gonna work.

18:49.742 --> 18:51.437
But I'm optimistic.

18:51.510 --> 18:53.410
NARRATOR:
This might be their last chance

18:53.479 --> 18:56.312
to blow the lock like Mac did.

18:56.382 --> 18:58.976
3... 2... 1.

18:59.051 --> 19:01.986
[Cheering]

19:02.054 --> 19:03.453
It ignited.

19:03.522 --> 19:05.114
- That was cool.
- That was cool.

19:05.191 --> 19:06.988
All right, let's see
if it opened that lock.

19:09.295 --> 19:10.125
No.

19:10.196 --> 19:12.130
NARRATOR:
The lock is intact,

19:12.198 --> 19:15.429
though it still looks
real good on the high-speed.

19:15.501 --> 19:17.366
GRANT: It looks just like it did
on the episode.

19:17.436 --> 19:18.835
- TORY: Yeah.
- Except for that part

19:18.904 --> 19:20.030
where the door opens.

19:20.105 --> 19:22.232
NARRATOR:
So, this door-busting myth,

19:22.308 --> 19:24.799
as seen on TV, is busted.

19:24.877 --> 19:28.176
But Grant still has faith
in the general principle.

19:28.247 --> 19:29.976
Just for the sake
of argument,

19:30.049 --> 19:34.179
let's say that MacGyver had
a lot of black-powder bullets.

19:34.253 --> 19:36.619
Yeah!
Let's fill the whole thing!

19:36.689 --> 19:39.214
Fill the lock with black powder
and then see.

19:39.291 --> 19:42.556
NARRATOR: So they do,
all the way up to the keyhole.

19:42.628 --> 19:45.290
TORY: And I've measured out
600 grains of black powder.

19:45.364 --> 19:48.492
That's 120 bullets worth
of black powder.

19:48.567 --> 19:50.296
Now, that's a lot more
than MacGyver had.

19:50.369 --> 19:52.200
Is that gonna be enough
to blow the lock open?

19:52.271 --> 19:53.636
We're about to find out.

19:53.706 --> 19:55.936
NARRATOR: And their best chance
for a big result

19:56.008 --> 20:00.240
is to forego the cartridge cap
for an electric igniter.

20:00.312 --> 20:02.746
How it works is you apply
a battery to this end,

20:02.815 --> 20:04.840
the current flows
through the wire,

20:04.917 --> 20:06.714
heats up a little piece of wire
here at the end

20:06.785 --> 20:09.049
that heats up a chemical,
and... phht!..

20:09.121 --> 20:11.589
Instant ignition
for our gunpowder.

20:11.657 --> 20:14.091
NARRATOR: Now Kari's prepared
to make a prediction

20:14.159 --> 20:15.490
that's crystal clear.

20:15.561 --> 20:17.426
KARI: I think there's gonna be
a nice colorful boom,

20:17.496 --> 20:18.485
but I don't think

20:18.564 --> 20:20.088
that we're actually
gonna explode this lock,

20:20.165 --> 20:22.360
because I think
that the keyholes

20:22.434 --> 20:24.459
are gonna let
all of that pressure out.

20:24.537 --> 20:26.095
NARRATOR:
You can't fault the theory,

20:26.171 --> 20:30.107
but this ain't over till they've
blown the gizzards out of it.

20:30.175 --> 20:31.733
All righty, boys.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.744
- Yes, girl.
- [Chuckles]

20:33.812 --> 20:37.475
This is lock, half full of black
powder, electric igniter,

20:37.550 --> 20:39.677
just for the heck of it
because we can.

20:39.752 --> 20:42.846
Well, if it does explode,
it could open that door.

20:42.922 --> 20:45.152
I don't know about that.
We'll see.

20:45.224 --> 20:48.387
All right, in 3... 2... 1.

20:49.028 --> 20:51.553
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

20:51.630 --> 20:52.688
Yeah!

20:52.765 --> 20:53.925
Wow!

20:53.999 --> 20:55.296
We blew the door open!

20:55.367 --> 20:56.595
Blew the door open!

20:56.669 --> 20:58.102
Why am I always wrong?

20:58.170 --> 21:00.070
Yeah!

21:00.139 --> 21:01.504
KARI:
I grossly underestimated

21:01.574 --> 21:03.474
the power of black powder
in this lock.

21:03.542 --> 21:06.170
I thought there was no way
in heck that door was opening

21:06.245 --> 21:08.042
and it's wide open,
and I hate it

21:08.113 --> 21:09.842
when Tory's right and I'm wrong.

21:09.915 --> 21:10.939
I hate that.

21:11.617 --> 21:15.610
As much fun as I had today,
I'm a little bit disappointed.

21:15.688 --> 21:17.417
Why? 'Cause every prediction
you had was wrong?

21:17.489 --> 21:19.150
Yeah.
A little bit.

21:19.224 --> 21:22.751
But, I mean, guys,
we busted MacGyver.

21:22.828 --> 21:25.126
Yes, but we proved that
the general principle is sound.

21:25.197 --> 21:27.097
You just need
a lot more gunpowder.

21:27.166 --> 21:29.396
And we even proved
that you could set off gunpowder

21:29.468 --> 21:30.435
using an empty cartridge

21:30.502 --> 21:32.629
by hitting it
with the butt of a gun.

21:32.705 --> 21:33.729
I'm very impressed.

21:33.806 --> 21:35.831
But we did have
a clear demonstration

21:35.908 --> 21:38.001
on how this was supposed
to have worked from the TV show

21:38.077 --> 21:39.942
using only 6 bullets
worth of powder,

21:40.012 --> 21:42.037
and we didn't come
anywhere close to that.

21:42.114 --> 21:44.048
All right,
so this one is busted.

21:44.116 --> 21:45.208
Busted.

21:45.284 --> 21:46.308
Busted.

21:46.385 --> 21:47.943
Well, you know what?
It's not MacGyver's fault.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.009
It was the writer's fault.

21:49.088 --> 21:50.146
Good point.

21:50.222 --> 21:51.655
MacGyver is real.

21:51.724 --> 21:53.692
Yeah.
So is the tooth fairy.

21:53.759 --> 21:55.693
No, that's a myth.

21:55.761 --> 21:56.853
No, he's real, too.

21:56.929 --> 21:58.294
No, Sasquatch is a myth.

22:05.638 --> 22:08.539
NARRATOR:
We all love syrup on pancakes.

22:08.607 --> 22:12.008
But Adam and Jamie are dipping
into some complex physics

22:12.077 --> 22:13.942
to see if they can swim in syrup

22:14.013 --> 22:15.981
just as fast as they can
in water.

22:16.048 --> 22:17.481
Blaah!

22:17.549 --> 22:20.541
[Laughing]

22:20.619 --> 22:21.779
Well, the results are in.

22:21.854 --> 22:24.516
We both swam
significantly slower in syrup.

22:24.590 --> 22:26.353
It's not looking good
for the myth.

22:26.425 --> 22:29.258
I know, but I'm not willing
to let this one go.

22:29.328 --> 22:30.920
I'm starting to believe
that we might've gotten

22:30.996 --> 22:32.987
this whole viscosity thing
all wrong.

22:33.065 --> 22:36.000
How so? Nobody would deny
that we were swimming in syrup.

22:36.068 --> 22:39.162
Right. But it was an average
Joe's interpretation of syrup,

22:39.238 --> 22:42.605
and it was 1,500 times
more viscous than water,

22:42.675 --> 22:46.133
and this myth has its origins
as a physics thought experiment.

22:46.211 --> 22:47.371
To a physicist,

22:47.446 --> 22:50.347
something that's only
twice the viscosity of water

22:50.416 --> 22:52.213
could be called a syrup,

22:52.284 --> 22:54.149
and we might get
very different results

22:54.219 --> 22:55.516
with a material like that.

22:55.587 --> 22:57.077
NARRATOR:
Back in the trenches,

22:57.156 --> 23:01.752
it's time for a full-scale
refill with a brand-new recipe.

23:01.827 --> 23:03.419
This should be perfect.
Let's let her rip.

23:03.495 --> 23:04.427
All right.

23:04.496 --> 23:06.487
Let's bring on the water.

23:07.533 --> 23:09.433
So, we have,
in order to test this,

23:09.501 --> 23:11.366
scaled back
our syrup swimming pool,

23:11.437 --> 23:13.496
all the way down to something
that's only between

23:13.572 --> 23:16.006
two and five times as viscous
as water.

23:16.075 --> 23:18.100
But rest assured,
to a physicist,

23:18.177 --> 23:20.304
this is a significant difference
from regular water.

23:20.379 --> 23:21.778
Now the question is...

23:21.847 --> 23:24.407
"Will there be a significant
difference in my swimming time?"

23:24.483 --> 23:25.472
NARRATOR: But first,

23:25.551 --> 23:28.076
we'll have to re-rate Adam
in regular water.

23:28.153 --> 23:29.848
After all, it's a new day,

23:29.922 --> 23:33.824
and he could be
a few seconds slower or faster.

23:34.760 --> 23:38.560
Adam's first effort shows that
getting a new set of figures

23:38.630 --> 23:40.564
was a prudent move.

23:40.632 --> 23:41.758
JAMIE:
You're there!

23:41.834 --> 23:43.267
13.43.

23:43.335 --> 23:44.666
Damn!

23:44.737 --> 23:46.204
I was worried
that I was out of shape,

23:46.271 --> 23:47.295
but that's pretty darn good.

23:47.372 --> 23:48.634
Let's go for another one.

23:48.707 --> 23:50.004
- JAMIE: Go!
- [Gunshot]

23:50.075 --> 23:52.168
NARRATOR: The average time
for all three swims

23:52.244 --> 23:55.645
is a full second faster
than the day before.

23:56.882 --> 23:59.715
Why don't we take a quick break
and then move into the syrup?

23:59.785 --> 24:01.946
Why don't we take a little bit
of a reasonable break,

24:02.020 --> 24:04.113
and then I'll swim in the syrup?

24:04.189 --> 24:05.247
Okay.

24:05.324 --> 24:07.451
NARRATOR: While Adam takes
a well-earned soak,

24:07.526 --> 24:09.653
let's reflect
on the practical benefits

24:09.728 --> 24:12.128
of learning to swim
through syrup.

24:14.933 --> 24:16.059
Somebody is gonna be wondering

24:16.135 --> 24:20.162
what possible real-world
application this is gonna have.

24:20.239 --> 24:21.763
That person would be ignoring

24:21.840 --> 24:27.210
the fact of the great
1919 molasses flood in Boston,

24:27.279 --> 24:31.511
in which a massive vat
of molasses broke free.

24:31.583 --> 24:35.383
Molasses poured into the streets
and killed 21 people,

24:35.454 --> 24:38.389
who presumably had no idea
how to swim in syrup.

24:38.457 --> 24:41.426
Well, it just goes to show,
you got to collect those skills

24:41.493 --> 24:42.983
to be ready for anything,
right?

24:43.061 --> 24:44.050
Yeah.

24:44.129 --> 24:46.290
NARRATOR:
Meantime, back at Club Mud...

24:46.365 --> 24:48.230
Aah! It's cold.

24:48.300 --> 24:49.358
Okay, here we go.

24:49.434 --> 24:51.163
Whoa! Aah! Ooh!

24:51.236 --> 24:54.467
JAMIE: Okay, Adam in syrup
twice as thick as water.

24:54.540 --> 24:56.405
[Gunshot]

24:56.475 --> 24:58.306
NARRATOR:
...Adam strikes out again...

24:58.877 --> 24:59.969
You're there!

25:00.045 --> 25:02.673
NARRATOR:
...and sets a really fast time.

25:02.748 --> 25:05.114
14.02 seconds.

25:05.184 --> 25:07.414
Nice!
You know what that is?

25:07.486 --> 25:09.852
That's significant data.

25:09.922 --> 25:11.913
- Let's go again.
- Okay.

25:13.725 --> 25:18.492
NARRATOR: Adam's next two laps
are both well under 15 seconds.

25:18.564 --> 25:20.191
JAMIE:
You're there!

25:20.265 --> 25:22.256
14.62.

25:22.334 --> 25:25.997
Ah, it looks like I'm getting
tired and slowing down.

25:26.071 --> 25:27.060
JAMIE:
A little bit.

25:27.139 --> 25:28.367
NARRATOR:
At the very least,

25:28.440 --> 25:31.068
this comparison
looks like a close call.

25:31.143 --> 25:32.474
JAMIE: Do you want to know
how you did?

25:32.544 --> 25:33.636
ADAM:
Lay it on me, coach.

25:33.712 --> 25:35.771
JAMIE:
Okay, well, in the heavy syrup,

25:35.848 --> 25:39.875
you swam 27% slower
than you did in water,

25:39.952 --> 25:41.886
but in the light syrup,

25:41.954 --> 25:45.913
you swam 2.8% slower
than you did in water.

25:45.991 --> 25:48.186
- Wow.
- That's a big difference.

25:48.260 --> 25:50.228
Yeah, I mean, I'll wager
there's a difference

25:50.295 --> 25:52.991
between any three of my times
in either of the water

25:53.065 --> 25:55.590
or either of the syrups
was greater than 2.8%.

25:55.667 --> 25:58.227
Yeah, that's less than
half-a-second variation.

25:58.303 --> 25:59.861
That's well within
the margin of error.

25:59.938 --> 26:01.633
That's a really cool result.

26:01.707 --> 26:03.800
NARRATOR:
In the heavy treacle analog,

26:03.876 --> 26:07.368
Adam's times were 28% slower
than they were in water,

26:07.446 --> 26:08.743
so that's myth busted.

26:08.814 --> 26:11.408
Then, again,
his times in light syrup

26:11.483 --> 26:13.678
were much the same
as swimming in water,

26:13.752 --> 26:15.310
so that's myth confirmed.

26:15.387 --> 26:18.720
Obviously, there's a threshold
between the two,

26:18.790 --> 26:21.987
and I'd like to find where
that threshold exactly is...

26:22.060 --> 26:25.655
i.e., something that
the layperson would call syrup,

26:25.731 --> 26:28.529
yet you can swim
just as fast in it.

26:38.076 --> 26:40.135
Why am I chopping wood, you ask?

26:40.212 --> 26:42.305
Not because I'm a lumberjack
and I'm okay,

26:42.381 --> 26:44.576
but because we're about
to test a myth

26:44.650 --> 26:47.778
that comes from one of America's
greatest legends...

26:47.853 --> 26:50.117
Davy Crockett,
king of the wild frontier.

26:50.188 --> 26:52.281
Now, apparently,
he would take his ax

26:52.357 --> 26:54.086
and throw it against a tree.

26:54.927 --> 26:57.327
And then he would take
his trusty musket, Betsy,

26:57.396 --> 26:59.330
fire a shot at the ax head,

26:59.398 --> 27:01.229
and split the bullet
clean in half.

27:01.300 --> 27:02.733
And that is what
we're gonna test

27:02.801 --> 27:04.598
to see if it's really possible.

27:06.939 --> 27:09.100
NARRATOR:
Back in the early 1800s,

27:09.174 --> 27:10.573
Davy Crockett gained fame

27:10.642 --> 27:14.840
as a U.S. Congressman
and a fearless frontier type.

27:14.913 --> 27:18.212
Self-described as half horse,
half alligator,

27:18.283 --> 27:22.686
Davy had a reputation for,
well, embellishing the truth.

27:22.754 --> 27:25.154
He once boasted
the prettiest sister

27:25.223 --> 27:27.885
and the ugliest dog
in the country.

27:27.960 --> 27:29.484
So, look, this guy was real

27:29.561 --> 27:31.461
and a huge part
of American folklore.

27:31.530 --> 27:33.760
Yeah, back in the '50s,
almost every kid

27:33.832 --> 27:36.357
had one of those
Davy Crockett coonskin caps.

27:36.435 --> 27:38.062
But he did tell
a lot of whoppers.

27:38.136 --> 27:40.798
He used to say that he could
grin the bark off a tree.

27:40.872 --> 27:42.430
And that's just one tall tale.

27:42.507 --> 27:43.997
With all these crazy stories,

27:44.076 --> 27:45.873
it casts a lot of doubt
on this myth

27:45.944 --> 27:48.344
that he could split a bullet
by hitting an ax head.

27:48.413 --> 27:50.438
Fortunately,
I couldn't agree more.

27:50.515 --> 27:52.107
NARRATOR:
It's an old-time myth

27:52.184 --> 27:55.176
you just couldn't test
with modern firearms.

27:55.253 --> 27:57.983
200 years ago,
the guns were slower

27:58.056 --> 28:01.287
and the lead bullets
were rounder and softer.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.591
But rest assured,
the axes were sharp.

28:04.663 --> 28:06.324
All we have to do
is shoot the ax head

28:06.398 --> 28:07.558
with a bullet
and split it in two.

28:07.632 --> 28:09.691
How hard can that be?

28:09.768 --> 28:11.702
What are we gonna do
with the rest of our day?

28:11.770 --> 28:12.737
[Laughing] I don't know.

28:12.804 --> 28:14.829
KARI: I'm always looking forward
to the historical myths,

28:14.906 --> 28:16.339
and this one is extra fun

28:16.408 --> 28:18.808
because I really, really am
into Davy Crockett.

28:18.877 --> 28:23.041
I love all of the cap-and-ball
musket shooting.

28:23.115 --> 28:24.776
It's gonna be a good day.

28:24.850 --> 28:26.010
NARRATOR:
That's the spirit, Kari.

28:26.084 --> 28:29.212
Unwavering optimism
in the face of yet another myth

28:29.287 --> 28:30.618
that beggars belief.

28:33.458 --> 28:34.584
There you go.

28:34.659 --> 28:36.422
Pin the tail
on the coonskin cap.

28:36.495 --> 28:39.055
TORY: Hitting our target with
these muskets is gonna be tough.

28:39.131 --> 28:42.430
They're heavy. They're not as
accurate as a modern-day rifle.

28:42.501 --> 28:44.799
So we thought maybe if
we dress up like Davy Crockett,

28:44.870 --> 28:47.532
maybe that'll give us
an advantage to hit our target.

28:47.606 --> 28:48.630
Maybe we channel him.

28:48.707 --> 28:51.870
Davy, Davy,
help me hit my target.

28:51.943 --> 28:52.910
But I doubt it.

28:52.978 --> 28:55.572
NARRATOR: Now, most folk
wouldn't take advice

28:55.647 --> 28:57.205
from a man who shot his own hat,

28:57.282 --> 29:00.012
but I wouldn't say that out loud
to Jim Mitchell.

29:00.819 --> 29:04.186
Jim's an expert
on antique American firearms.

29:04.256 --> 29:05.746
- Jim!
- Good to see you again.

29:05.824 --> 29:06.916
Good to see you.

29:08.126 --> 29:10.151
KARI:
Jim's outfit terrifies me.

29:10.228 --> 29:12.560
I feel like his hat is gonna
bite him at any moment

29:12.631 --> 29:14.724
or just, like, crawl up on me.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.735
I see you got a couple of
.58 calibers there with you.

29:17.803 --> 29:20.397
Are you comfortable with them,
shooting them, loading them?

29:21.239 --> 29:23.605
Maybe you should give us
a little refresher course.

29:23.675 --> 29:25.267
NARRATOR:
It sure couldn't hurt.

29:25.343 --> 29:28.870
These old-time rifles
aren't exactly user-friendly.

29:28.947 --> 29:31.711
First thing,
you load up your powder.

29:31.783 --> 29:33.614
Measure your powder out
into the measure.

29:33.685 --> 29:35.949
KARI: It's quite a procedure
loading up a musket.

29:36.021 --> 29:37.784
First, you've got to pour
the gunpowder

29:37.856 --> 29:39.255
directly into the barrel.

29:39.324 --> 29:41.451
Then you've got, like,
a lubricated little patch

29:41.526 --> 29:43.289
that you stuff a lead ball on,
and you have to stuff it

29:43.361 --> 29:44.419
all the way down.

29:44.496 --> 29:46.430
I mean, can you imagine
loading that thing

29:46.498 --> 29:48.762
over and over and over,
if you had to be a quick shot?

29:50.135 --> 29:53.229
NARRATOR: But shooting
these guns is just as tricky.

29:53.305 --> 29:55.034
They all need practice,

29:55.107 --> 29:57.575
and here's Kari's tip
for making fruit salad

29:57.642 --> 29:59.837
in less than
a tenth of a second.

29:59.911 --> 30:02.573
- GRANT: Nice!
- [Laughter]

30:02.647 --> 30:04.444
NARRATOR:
Grant shoots a soda bottle.

30:04.516 --> 30:05.915
[Gunshot]

30:05.984 --> 30:08.077
TORY: Yeah!

30:08.153 --> 30:09.780
- KARI: Nice!
- Ha ha!

30:09.855 --> 30:12.016
NARRATOR:
And Tory terminates a tomato.

30:12.090 --> 30:13.921
Get it.
Get that tomato.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.724
That's what you get
for not being organic!

30:17.796 --> 30:19.058
Whoo!

30:19.131 --> 30:21.065
TORY: Right now,
we're just hitting the targets

30:21.133 --> 30:22.794
just to see if we can
sight these guns in,

30:22.868 --> 30:24.460
and they seem pretty accurate.

30:24.536 --> 30:26.834
The tricky part now, though,
is to be able to hit

30:26.905 --> 30:28.839
that ax blade dead center
with the bullet

30:28.907 --> 30:30.465
so we get it to split,
because if it hits

30:30.542 --> 30:32.271
a little bit to the left
or a little bit to the right,

30:32.344 --> 30:34.175
it might just deflect
and stay one bullet.

30:34.246 --> 30:35.713
We need it to hit
right in the middle

30:35.780 --> 30:38.544
so we see two pieces after
the bullet hits the ax head.

30:40.952 --> 30:43.147
NARRATOR: Tory, Grant, and Kari
are testing the myth

30:43.221 --> 30:47.021
that Davy Crockett could hit
two targets with one bullet

30:47.092 --> 30:49.356
by splitting it
on an ax blade.

30:51.830 --> 30:54.458
So, now it's our chance
to do this myth for real.

30:54.533 --> 30:56.398
Now, legend has it
that Davy Crockett

30:56.468 --> 30:58.527
could do this trick
from 40 yards.

30:58.603 --> 31:01.401
So we're gonna measure out
40 yards and give it a shot.

31:01.473 --> 31:04.909
NARRATOR: But that's looking
a long, long way off.

31:05.844 --> 31:07.505
And...

31:07.579 --> 31:08.978
40 yards.

31:10.182 --> 31:11.877
That's kind of far.

31:11.950 --> 31:13.144
TORY:
I'm gonna take a shot.

31:13.218 --> 31:15.379
I doubt I'm gonna split it
on the first one.

31:15.453 --> 31:17.011
But who knows?
Maybe I'll get lucky.

31:17.088 --> 31:19.318
Sometimes it's better to be
lucky than good.

31:19.391 --> 31:22.827
NARRATOR: Now, we should get
some idea of just how sharp

31:22.894 --> 31:24.623
the shooting has to be.

31:26.097 --> 31:29.430
Not bad at all.
Let's try a take two.

31:33.271 --> 31:34.829
KARI:
Still a little to the left.

31:36.174 --> 31:37.835
Tory has got one more shot

31:37.909 --> 31:39.706
before the others
get their chance.

31:39.778 --> 31:41.746
Confirming the two-target myth

31:41.813 --> 31:44.281
means splitting a bullet
in half.

31:44.349 --> 31:47.546
That's as tough as anything
these guys have ever attempted.

31:50.789 --> 31:52.222
KARI: Lookit.

31:52.290 --> 31:54.656
1, 2... pa-ching! ...3.

31:54.726 --> 31:57.456
- Whoa!
- I hit the blade.

31:57.529 --> 31:58.962
- That's great.
- That is crazy.

31:59.030 --> 32:00.691
Look at that.
It just hit here.

32:00.765 --> 32:02.392
I was maybe
an eighth of an inch off

32:02.467 --> 32:03.729
from hitting it dead center.

32:03.802 --> 32:06.032
KARI: I think with a little
practice, you could hit that.

32:06.104 --> 32:08.664
Yeah, if you practiced, you'd
be able to hit this all day.

32:08.740 --> 32:10.037
But we're not looking
at accuracy.

32:10.108 --> 32:12.042
We're looking at whether or not
you could split the bullet.

32:12.110 --> 32:14.135
All right, well,
let's split the difference.

32:14.212 --> 32:17.306
Come in 20 yards
and then try it again.

32:17.382 --> 32:18.679
All right.

32:19.551 --> 32:20.813
NARRATOR:
They bring the mark in,

32:20.885 --> 32:24.412
because this myth is more about
if a bullet can split in two,

32:24.489 --> 32:26.889
than where you took
the shot from.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.624
- Hey, nice shot.
- Wow!

32:31.963 --> 32:34.056
NARRATOR:
Kari goes close.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.995
Whoa!

32:37.068 --> 32:40.469
NARRATOR: Then closer,
as she grazes the handle.

32:40.538 --> 32:42.165
GRANT:
Look, you can see the burn mark.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.673
Nice shot!

32:43.742 --> 32:44.709
- Thank you.
- Good one.

32:44.776 --> 32:46.937
- Give me one more. One more.
- All right, one more shot.

32:47.012 --> 32:50.413
NARRATOR: Hard to say no
to a girl with a gun.

32:51.283 --> 32:53.979
KARI: Close, but no cigar,
as my dad would say.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.987
Look at that.
Just grazed the ax.

32:58.056 --> 33:00.183
To be able to hit the blade
by shooting off hand,

33:00.258 --> 33:02.317
it's gonna take a long time
and a lot of practice.

33:02.394 --> 33:03.588
NARRATOR:
Daylight is fading,

33:03.662 --> 33:06.153
so Grant gets to shoot off
a sandbag.

33:06.231 --> 33:09.462
This could be the shot
that confirms the Crockett myth.

33:09.534 --> 33:12.867
This ax don't stand a chance.

33:14.673 --> 33:17.642
- You hit the blade.
- Look right here. Skimmed it.

33:17.709 --> 33:19.233
You're real close.

33:19.311 --> 33:20.573
TORY:
So you've just got to go over

33:20.645 --> 33:22.510
just, like, an eighth
of an inch to the right.

33:22.580 --> 33:23.569
Like a hair.

33:25.116 --> 33:27.084
NARRATOR:
The shots are almost perfect,

33:27.152 --> 33:30.644
but for this test,
"almost" just doesn't cut it.

33:30.722 --> 33:33.850
You know what? It's incredibly
difficult, even off the rest.

33:33.925 --> 33:35.984
So I'm gonna give it
one more shot.

33:36.061 --> 33:40.657
NARRATOR: And Grant can see
Coyote Jim waiting in the wings.

33:42.701 --> 33:44.225
GRANT:
No splits.

33:44.302 --> 33:47.703
If Davy Crockett could do this,
he was quite a shot.

33:47.772 --> 33:49.399
TORY: Now, before we move on
to the expert,

33:49.474 --> 33:52.807
how would you guys feel about me
taking one shot from the bench?

33:52.877 --> 33:54.572
- Sure. Go ahead.
- Knock yourself out.

33:54.646 --> 33:56.273
I'm dying to do it.

33:56.348 --> 33:57.747
NARRATOR:
And we're dying to see

33:57.816 --> 34:01.274
if this split-bullet myth
is just another tall tale.

34:01.353 --> 34:04.117
Someone needs to step up
and hit that blade

34:04.189 --> 34:06.419
with perfect precision.

34:08.693 --> 34:10.159
[Laughter]

34:10.228 --> 34:12.219
Ha ha!

34:12.297 --> 34:13.764
NARRATOR:
Tory has done it.

34:13.831 --> 34:16.733
One-half of the bullet went
left, and the other went right.

34:16.801 --> 34:18.199
- You did it!
- I can't believe it.

34:18.268 --> 34:21.136
- It actually worked.
- KARI: Both sides. Look.

34:21.206 --> 34:22.297
Right there,
that's where it hit.

34:22.373 --> 34:24.103
- Chink, chink.
- Yeah.

34:24.175 --> 34:25.835
- GRANT: It's confirmed.
- TORY: Totally confirmed.

34:25.909 --> 34:29.107
- Who thought that?
- Davy Crockett didn't lie.

34:29.179 --> 34:31.170
So, we showed
you can split a bullet

34:31.248 --> 34:32.739
and take out two targets
at once.

34:32.817 --> 34:35.411
Yeah, that was using
an ax, ammunition,

34:35.487 --> 34:37.648
and weapons
from Davy Crockett's time.

34:37.722 --> 34:40.282
And a little bit of mojo
from Davy Crockett.

34:40.358 --> 34:41.620
The outfits.

34:41.693 --> 34:43.058
So, this one's confirmed.

34:43.128 --> 34:44.857
- Confirmed.
- Confirmed.

34:51.168 --> 34:52.966
NARRATOR:
Jamie and Adam are testing

34:53.036 --> 34:56.473
if the extra thrust you'd get
from swimming through syrup

34:56.541 --> 34:59.601
might just counteract
the added resistance.

34:59.677 --> 35:02.077
So, now they'll mix up
one last batch

35:02.147 --> 35:05.412
with a texture that's more like
good old maple syrup.

35:05.483 --> 35:07.917
[Horn blares]

35:07.986 --> 35:11.888
Not too thick, not too thin,
but just right.

35:11.956 --> 35:13.184
That's the Goldilocks myth.

35:13.258 --> 35:14.953
We're mixing up a batch
right now,

35:15.026 --> 35:17.221
and, soon, we'll be putting it
to the test.

35:17.295 --> 35:19.092
NARRATOR:
It's a blend that should meet

35:19.164 --> 35:24.101
any definition of syrup...
500 times thicker than water.

35:26.237 --> 35:28.432
JAMIE: So, these are
Adam's last three swims,

35:28.506 --> 35:30.804
and given how fast he swam
in the light syrup,

35:30.875 --> 35:33.810
his times in this stuff
should be really interesting.

35:33.878 --> 35:35.140
What's my time?

35:35.213 --> 35:37.113
14.34.

35:37.182 --> 35:39.082
Yeah! [Laughs]

35:39.150 --> 35:42.119
JAMIE: That goofy-looking scum
on top we call fish eyes.

35:42.187 --> 35:44.587
It's just clusters of guar gum.

35:44.656 --> 35:48.023
Adam actually
seems to enjoy swimming in it.

35:48.092 --> 35:49.491
13.81.

35:49.561 --> 35:51.290
[Laughs] Yeah!

35:51.362 --> 35:52.294
Whoo!

35:52.363 --> 35:54.024
- Good job.
- Thank you.

35:54.098 --> 35:55.690
You're done.
You can get out now.

35:55.767 --> 35:57.132
I'm officially done.

35:57.202 --> 35:59.397
NARRATOR: Adam's times
were nice and steady,

35:59.471 --> 36:00.768
but it stands to reason

36:00.839 --> 36:03.808
that a better swimmer
would be even more consistent,

36:03.875 --> 36:06.343
and that makes
for better science.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.071
Enter this fine specimen.

36:11.149 --> 36:13.413
Nathan Adrian
was a gold-medal winner

36:13.485 --> 36:14.747
at the Beijing Olympics.

36:14.819 --> 36:16.650
- Hello, sir.
- Hi. How's it going?

36:16.721 --> 36:18.416
Oh, my God, look at you.
[Laughs]

36:18.490 --> 36:20.651
- Hi, Nathan.
- Hi. How are you doing?

36:20.725 --> 36:23.421
That's perfect. You feel like
running some tests for us?

36:23.495 --> 36:24.723
Absolutely.
I'd love to.

36:25.864 --> 36:27.855
NARRATOR: Let's start him off
in a bent pool

36:27.932 --> 36:32.426
filled with straight water
to set a baseline time.

36:32.504 --> 36:35.564
ADAM: This surprise of Jamie's
is proving extremely fruitful.

36:35.640 --> 36:38.541
Not only is Nathan fast,
which I expected.

36:38.610 --> 36:40.305
He's super consistent.

36:40.378 --> 36:42.744
All of his times are within
a half a second of each other.

36:42.814 --> 36:45.374
My times had about
a one-second spread,

36:45.450 --> 36:48.647
so it just means that the data
is that much more precise.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.381
9.81.

36:50.455 --> 36:52.150
Can we let him get out?

36:52.223 --> 36:53.554
Let's let him get out.

36:53.625 --> 36:56.150
NARRATOR: Now it's time
for this sports hero

36:56.227 --> 37:00.254
to swim in something gooey
and slippery.

37:00.331 --> 37:01.958
[Spitting]

37:02.033 --> 37:03.295
ADAM:
On your mark!

37:03.368 --> 37:05.859
- Get set!
- [Gunshot]

37:06.771 --> 37:08.898
JAMIE:
Nathan, just...

37:08.973 --> 37:12.204
pretend that you're one
with the syrup.

37:14.646 --> 37:16.341
Almost dead on the money.

37:16.414 --> 37:18.348
10.87.

37:18.416 --> 37:20.213
Is that funky or what?

37:20.285 --> 37:21.252
It's so weird.

37:21.319 --> 37:23.184
NARRATOR:
You can bet this wasn't part

37:23.254 --> 37:25.518
of Nathan's post-Olympic dream.

37:25.590 --> 37:27.717
JAMIE: Just think about it
like you got to swim faster

37:27.792 --> 37:29.157
to get out of it quicker.

37:29.227 --> 37:30.785
[Laughs]

37:30.862 --> 37:32.329
[Gunshot]

37:32.397 --> 37:34.331
NARRATOR:
A man with the right stuff,

37:34.399 --> 37:37.391
forced to wallow
in some very wrong stuff.

37:37.468 --> 37:38.526
ADAM: Awesome!

37:38.603 --> 37:40.833
I can tell you're starting
to get into it a little bit.

37:40.905 --> 37:43.465
It grows on you after a while,
doesn't it?

37:43.541 --> 37:44.872
[Laughter]

37:44.943 --> 37:46.570
ADRIAN:
As far as resistance goes,

37:46.644 --> 37:48.271
when you're swimming at speed,
it doesn't feel

37:48.346 --> 37:50.473
all that much different
than water, truthfully.

37:50.548 --> 37:53.483
NARRATOR: So, Jamie tries
to make sense of the stats.

37:53.551 --> 37:58.215
Nathan was a full 9% slower
in medium syrup than water.

37:58.289 --> 37:59.654
More surprisingly,

37:59.724 --> 38:02.284
while his water times
were super consistent,

38:02.360 --> 38:06.421
his syrup swims were much
less consistent than Adam's.

38:06.497 --> 38:11.127
And with Adam swimming just
5.4% slower in syrup than water,

38:11.202 --> 38:13.727
which is almost
within his margin of error,

38:13.805 --> 38:16.501
this myth could still go
either way.

38:16.574 --> 38:18.439
JAMIE: Do you think
that you were slower

38:18.509 --> 38:20.841
because the goo
was offering more resistance

38:20.912 --> 38:24.746
or because it was messing
with your technique?

38:24.816 --> 38:26.477
I'd have to say
it was definitely messing

38:26.551 --> 38:29.611
with my technique and how
comfortable I was in the water.

38:29.687 --> 38:31.154
It's such a huge disadvantage

38:31.222 --> 38:33.417
to be in such
a foreign environment

38:33.491 --> 38:34.753
with the goop and everything.

38:34.826 --> 38:37.158
NARRATOR: None of which
seems to bother our boys,

38:37.228 --> 38:39.628
but given
Nathan's erratic times,

38:39.697 --> 38:42.188
Adam is prepared
to drop a bombshell.

38:42.266 --> 38:46.498
We're gonna throw out Nathan's
swim times in the syrup.

38:46.571 --> 38:47.697
See, we brought him in...

38:47.772 --> 38:49.239
being an Olympic swimmer,
one of the best in the world,

38:49.307 --> 38:50.638
we thought
it was gonna eliminate

38:50.708 --> 38:52.403
swimming time as a variable.

38:52.477 --> 38:55.378
But because what he does
for hours every day

38:55.446 --> 38:57.073
is swim in a clear-water pool,

38:57.148 --> 38:59.412
following a line,
going as fast as he can,

38:59.484 --> 39:03.215
the syrup threw his technique
out the window.

39:03.287 --> 39:06.620
Mine prove the point
much better than his do.

39:06.691 --> 39:08.181
That's pretty cool.

39:09.827 --> 39:12.523
So, how are we gonna
wrap this one up?

39:12.597 --> 39:15.691
The simple fact is that
you swam just about as fast

39:15.767 --> 39:17.860
in the medium,
or Goldilocks syrup,

39:17.935 --> 39:20.062
and the light syrup
as you did in water.

39:20.138 --> 39:23.107
Well, so, I'd say that makes it
solidly plausible.

39:23.174 --> 39:26.007
You can swim as fast in syrup
as you can in water.

39:26.077 --> 39:30.639
Plausible, depending on
the viscosity of the "syrup."

39:34.419 --> 39:37.013
NARRATOR: So, that's a wrap
for swimming in syrup,

39:37.088 --> 39:39.113
but there's still
some unfinished business

39:39.190 --> 39:40.589
on the MacGyver set.

39:40.658 --> 39:43.593
GRANT: Well, we Mythbusters
have never been ones

39:43.661 --> 39:45.219
to leave well enough alone,

39:45.296 --> 39:49.528
and we have a door here that
we just don't want to take home.

39:49.600 --> 39:53.036
NARRATOR: And with a little help
from J. D. And some C-4,

39:53.104 --> 39:54.093
they won't have to.

39:54.172 --> 39:55.605
The question is...
do you want to do

39:55.673 --> 39:57.334
a surgical kind of
an entry around the lock,

39:57.408 --> 39:59.103
or do you want to just
blow the crap out of it?

39:59.177 --> 40:01.941
NARRATOR: Hardly worth asking
the question, really.

40:02.013 --> 40:03.105
Blow the crap out of it.

40:03.181 --> 40:04.842
- Let's blow the crap out of it.
- Yeah!

40:04.916 --> 40:06.315
I guess we'll be
in the bunker, then.

40:06.384 --> 40:08.113
NARRATOR:
So, our guys duck for cover.

40:08.186 --> 40:09.813
J. D. Sets the charge

40:09.887 --> 40:13.482
and bellows out
his four favorite words.

40:13.558 --> 40:15.116
Fire in the hole!

40:15.193 --> 40:16.751
Fire in the hole!

40:16.828 --> 40:18.090
Fire in the hole!

40:18.663 --> 40:21.655
In 3... 2... 1.

40:22.667 --> 40:24.601
- KARI: Whoa!
- Whoa!

40:24.669 --> 40:27.968
That's what I'm talking about!

40:28.773 --> 40:29.967
NARRATOR:
To borrow a phrase

40:30.041 --> 40:33.408
from the poet of plastic
explosives, Jamie Hyneman,

40:33.478 --> 40:34.775
bye-bye, door.

40:34.846 --> 40:36.279
[Laughs]

40:36.347 --> 40:37.905
Screw black powder.

40:37.982 --> 40:39.540
That is incredible.

40:39.617 --> 40:41.778
That's like 70 feet away
from the blast site.

40:41.853 --> 40:44.413
[Laughs]

40:45.423 --> 40:46.890
GRANT:
Now, personally,

40:46.958 --> 40:51.122
I think that if MacGyver had
carried around a lot more C-4,

40:51.195 --> 40:54.687
he could've gotten through
a lot more doors a lot easier.
