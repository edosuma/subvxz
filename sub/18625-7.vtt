00:17.976 --> 00:21.146
All right. Do your worst.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.940
[clears throat, grunts]

00:28.070 --> 00:29.988
-[Toby] Ha!
-Whoo-hoo!

00:30.072 --> 00:31.698
-It slices!
-It dices!

00:31.782 --> 00:32.783
That was amazing!

00:35.035 --> 00:36.537
All right, what else you got?

00:36.620 --> 00:38.872
Mmm. You know,
we probably should recycle these.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.375
[gulps] On the other hand,
shredding them is more fun!

00:41.458 --> 00:43.585
It's less environmentally conscious,
but more fun!

00:43.669 --> 00:46.713
-Pull!
-[grunts]

00:51.927 --> 00:53.220
Oh! Home run! Whoo!

00:53.303 --> 00:56.139
It's like a ticker tape parade of awesome!

00:56.223 --> 00:57.683
-[laughing]
-[footsteps approaching]

00:57.766 --> 00:59.851
What is this mockery?

00:59.935 --> 01:03.855
Oh, hey, Draal. Just working
on some sword fighting skills.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.068
The Sword of Daylight is not
a toy to be played with.

01:08.151 --> 01:13.740
It is a hallowed obligation I have spent
my entire life training to be worthy of.

01:13.824 --> 01:17.160
-You want to take it for a spin?
-[snorts]

01:19.663 --> 01:20.664
[gasps]

01:26.128 --> 01:27.713
[gasps]

01:27.796 --> 01:29.631
[groans]
Huh?

01:30.507 --> 01:31.591
[sighs]

01:33.927 --> 01:35.470
Sorry. I forgot.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.014
[sighs]

01:37.097 --> 01:40.934
If my destiny is to not hold the sword,

01:41.018 --> 01:44.771
perhaps it is to teach you
how to properly wield it.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.446
[grunting]

01:54.364 --> 01:55.240
[winces]

01:55.324 --> 01:56.658
[breathing heavily]

01:56.742 --> 01:59.244
Your blade is but an extension
of your body,

01:59.328 --> 02:01.830
and your body, an extension of your eyes.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.167
Mimic my movements, Trollhunter.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.338
[grunting]

02:17.137 --> 02:19.264
-[grunts]
-[groans] That kinda hurts.

02:19.348 --> 02:23.101
[chuckles] A real fight
is never predictable, Trollhunter.

02:23.185 --> 02:27.522
You have to expect the unexpected
and learn to embody the armor,

02:27.606 --> 02:30.275
force it to do what you want.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.110
[breathing heavily]

02:37.157 --> 02:38.492
[laughing]

02:38.575 --> 02:41.828
-[grunts] Wow.
-[phone dinging]

02:41.912 --> 02:44.414
Shoot! We're supposed to meet Blinky
at the museum now.

02:44.498 --> 02:48.085
Ah! We'll work on this more later,
okay, Draal?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.544
Let's go, Tobes!

02:53.673 --> 02:55.008
Mmm...

02:56.802 --> 02:58.762
[moaning happily]

02:58.845 --> 03:00.013
Hmm?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.228
Mmm...

03:37.217 --> 03:41.430
Good, Blinky left the window open.
I hope he took care of the cameras.

03:41.513 --> 03:45.308
Oh, geez. It's true. You always
return to the scene of the crime.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.103
[screams]
They try to rehabilitate us,

03:48.186 --> 03:50.522
but the big house only made us
better criminals.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.441
[whispering]
The goblins are all gone.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.861
Ridiculous garment.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.739
-[groaning]
-[scoffs]

04:00.073 --> 04:03.201
-You're late.
-Sorry. Draal was training Jim. [grunts]

04:03.285 --> 04:04.494
-Draal?
-Training?

04:04.578 --> 04:08.874
Yeah, he sorta made a home in my basement
to look out for the place.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.001
Of course.
When a troll is defeated in combat,

04:11.084 --> 04:13.837
it's completely natural for them
to take refuge in the victor's domicile.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.880
So, you understand?

04:14.963 --> 04:20.677
I understand such an arrangement could
only end in disaster. Utter disaster!

04:20.761 --> 04:23.180
Are we simply waiting here
to be discovered?

04:23.263 --> 04:25.432
Or were you planning
on showing me this thing

04:25.515 --> 04:27.559
you believe to be the Killahead Bridge?

04:27.642 --> 04:31.980
[laughing] The Trollhunter was
just about to show us the way.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.316
And as we were chasing away
the goblin pack,

04:34.399 --> 04:36.443
we ran past this closed exhibit,

04:36.526 --> 04:39.780
and there it was: the Killahead Bridge.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.658
[gasps]

04:47.704 --> 04:51.416
[both grunting]

04:51.500 --> 04:52.501
Me.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.087
[gasps]

04:56.171 --> 04:59.299
-Oh, no.
-That is not a bridge.

04:59.382 --> 05:03.220
But it was right here! You saw it, Tobes.
You took a picture of it.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.766
It was, eh... It was out of focus,
and I did forget to turn on the flash.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.519
We were running so fast.
We were being chased, you know?

05:10.602 --> 05:12.646
Maybe we only thought we saw it.

05:12.729 --> 05:17.067
Blinkous Galadrigal,
I've not left the Heartstone in a century.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.569
I only did so tonight
because of the grave peril

05:19.653 --> 05:21.071
the Killahead Bridge represents.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.990
For you to invoke that danger
without just cause--

05:24.074 --> 05:25.534
If Master Jim says it's so--

05:25.617 --> 05:27.786
You will be only too quick to believe him.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.038
You've never met a conspiracy theory
you didn't like.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.916
I hate conspiracies. That is why
I am dedicated to rooting them out.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.294
Like you rooted out the plot
to rid Trollmarket of all its cat meat?

05:36.378 --> 05:37.671
That was a misunderstanding.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.924
Or the time you were convinced
we were infested with flea trolls?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.342
Precaution is the soul of virtue.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.928
Everyone in Trollmarket
thinks you're paranoid.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.348
If it's everyone,
it must be a conspiracy!

05:48.431 --> 05:49.641
[sighs]

05:49.724 --> 05:52.435
It would seem your pupil
is desperate to play the hero,

05:52.519 --> 05:55.855
while you are desperate
to see danger where none exists.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.693
-Aaarrrgghh, take me home.
-[groans]

06:00.860 --> 06:02.028
[chuckles awkwardly]

06:04.447 --> 06:06.950
It was right here.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.035
Perhaps Vendel's right.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.914
Perhaps I have flooded your imagination
with flights of fancy.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.292
[groans]
I blame myself.

06:15.375 --> 06:20.630
Not you, Blinky. You have to believe me.
I know what I saw.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.882
[sighs]

06:22.966 --> 06:25.510
If the proof isn't here,
it has to be somewhere.

06:25.594 --> 06:30.307
You worry about your studies.
I'll worry about this.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.313
[Toby] Say what we saw wasn't just
an illusion and they really did move it.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.939
How could we possibly find it?

06:38.023 --> 06:42.235
Well, I don't think we're gonna be lucky
enough to stumble on it again, Tobes.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.655
But one thing's for sure.
That curator did not move it by herself.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.866
Maybe she had help!
Other changelings, perhaps?

06:47.949 --> 06:49.117
Later.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.620
-Oh, no. Claire.
-Claire? A changeling?

06:51.703 --> 06:53.622
No. When I thought I was gonna die,

06:53.705 --> 06:56.416
I wrote Claire a letter, too,
and told her everything.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.209
-Everything?
-Everything.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.461
[school bell rings]

06:59.544 --> 07:01.713
-There you are!
-Hey! What's up, NuÃ±ez?

07:01.796 --> 07:03.673
-Hey, Colby.
-It's Toby.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.843
Not that it matters. You can call me
whatever you want. [yelps]

07:06.926 --> 07:08.970
You've been looking for me?

07:09.054 --> 07:11.973
You didn't run
into Ms. Janeth yet, did you?

07:12.057 --> 07:15.769
Is she mad I couldn't make rehearsal
yesterday? Something kinda came up.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.437
[groaning repeatedly]

07:17.520 --> 07:18.605
[chuckles]

07:18.688 --> 07:21.441
Steve filled in. That's what
understudies are for, right?

07:21.524 --> 07:25.528
Uh, you haven't heard? Steve isn't
the understudy anymore. You are.

07:25.612 --> 07:29.324
She's tired of you never showing up,
so she made Steve Romeo.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.243
-Come on! But I memorized all my lines!
-Doesn't matter.

07:32.327 --> 07:36.373
Ms. Janeth is on the warpath for you.
I'd watch out.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.667
-I have algebra with her, too.
-[school bell rings]

07:38.750 --> 07:39.668
Right now!

07:39.751 --> 07:45.590
As it is true for any such equation.
For instance, let's take 3X.

07:45.674 --> 07:49.511
So, you won't come to rehearsal,
Mr. Lake, but you arrive to class.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.222
I saved you the best seat, front row.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.767
-[boy] Loser.
-[Jim] Of course.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.270
[chuckles]

07:59.354 --> 08:03.608
As I was saying, every algebraic
equation requires balance.

08:03.692 --> 08:07.570
-Not unlike, say, actors in an ensemble!
-[chuckles]

08:07.654 --> 08:11.616
For instance, every piece of this equation
plays an important role.

08:11.700 --> 08:16.538
That is, unless variable X is a zero.
X has no role.

08:16.621 --> 08:20.417
X doesn't show up.
X lets the equation down.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.379
Then, the entire play--
I mean, equation-- falls apart!

08:24.462 --> 08:26.423
It becomes impossible!
[breathing heavily]

08:26.506 --> 08:27.757
[clears throat]

08:27.841 --> 08:32.636
Mr. Lake, how would you solve
this mathematical problem?

08:34.889 --> 08:37.017
[clears throat]
Ooh.

08:38.977 --> 08:44.065
Bye! Hey! I see you survived
Ms. Janeth's "Math Class of Doom."

08:44.149 --> 08:47.736
And, now, she's given me a mountain
of homework I hardly understand.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.073
You know, I did honors algebra last year
and was pretty okay at it.

08:52.157 --> 08:55.285
What if you came by my place
for a study sesh?

08:55.368 --> 08:56.870
Wow! Really?

08:56.953 --> 09:00.165
[stammering] Why would you do that?
I screwed up your play.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.876
Promoting Steve to Romeo wasn't your idea.

09:02.959 --> 09:07.714
And, honestly, I'd rather be on stage
with you, even if you are a total flake.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.798
[chuckles]

09:08.882 --> 09:12.385
-See you at six?
-Yeah, totally. See you at six.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.348
The matter at hand, Master Jim...
Master Jim?

09:18.058 --> 09:19.392
-Master Jim!
-[screams]

09:19.476 --> 09:22.270
Yes, sorry. Paying attention.
Paying attention!

09:22.353 --> 09:25.482
As I was saying, assuming
that Killahead Bridge was in Arcadia,

09:25.565 --> 09:29.360
and it was indeed, as you say,
delivered to a clandestine location,

09:29.444 --> 09:32.906
that would mean more changelings,
scavenging, assembling and disassembling.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.700
If we prove that the museum curator
wasn't working alone,

09:35.784 --> 09:38.953
then Vendel might start believing
that you saw the Killahead Bridge.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.289
So, we find another changeling.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.500
Stop saying that so loudly.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.086
-Do you mind?
-Whatever.

09:46.169 --> 09:49.547
[scoffs] Changelings have not been heard
or seen in Trollmarket for centuries.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.966
The mere word could cause hysteria.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.385
[Jim]
Then how do we find one?

09:54.469 --> 09:55.762
RotGut's.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.597
[both]
Whoa!

09:58.556 --> 10:02.435
Purveyor of fine charms,
totems, and spells.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.354
Follow my lead.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.691
Ailment or curse?

10:08.775 --> 10:12.695
-Oi, numbskull! I'm supposed to answer it!
-But I already did answer it.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.198
What is not clear about
"I deal with the customers,

10:15.281 --> 10:16.658
you handle the wizardry"?

10:16.741 --> 10:17.826
Hold a tick.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.911
[laughing]

10:19.994 --> 10:21.788
Good, Rot. Stick with that.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.375
Welcome to RotGut's.
How may we service you?

10:25.458 --> 10:30.088
Totem, my good troll. We suspect one
of these fleshbags may be a changeling.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.591
-Hmm?
-Other fleshbags.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.969
-You're gonna need a gaggletack.
-[chuckles]

10:36.052 --> 10:40.640
Unfortunately, you see, we're running
a bit short on those. Very hard to get.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.935
-But I've got a bag of them right here.
-What in the world?

10:44.018 --> 10:46.312
If you'll excuse us for one moment.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.774
Ey, what are you doing? I'm trying
to drive up the price over here.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.819
I thought we were trying
to help these nice lads.

10:52.902 --> 10:56.489
-Gaggletack?
-Rare artifact.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.951
Exceedingly rare.
An object of great mystery.

11:00.034 --> 11:03.329
With physical contact, it reveals
the true nature of a changeling.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.583
-Why don't you open the door...
-Step back, please.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.543
...our hard-earned bits and bobs?

11:10.253 --> 11:13.006
[groans]
It hurts!

11:13.089 --> 11:15.550
-It's a horseshoe.
-Made of pure iron.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.511
Why would you put such a precious thing
on a horse's foot?

11:18.595 --> 11:19.470
Huh?

11:19.554 --> 11:23.224
Beware. Changelings are swapped
with their human counterparts at birth.

11:23.308 --> 11:27.228
So, it is likely these troll-pretenders
have dwelt amongst you for decades.

11:27.312 --> 11:32.400
They could be anyone. Used car salesmen,
tax collectors, television executives.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.236
-Dentists.
-Yes, especially dentists.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.531
-So, who do we start with?
-Oh, I've got a few ideas.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.910
[straining]

11:45.788 --> 11:46.998
[sighs]

11:47.081 --> 11:49.500
Domzalski! Drop down and give me 50.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.425
[yelps]
Um... Hi, Jim!

11:57.508 --> 11:59.510
-Oh!
-[chuckles]

11:59.594 --> 12:00.803
Thank you!

12:01.679 --> 12:05.892
Step right up!
Toss a horseshoe! Win a prize!

12:05.975 --> 12:09.020
Step right up.
Toss a horseshoe. Win a prize.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.314
-Check out the freakshow!
-[both laugh]

12:11.397 --> 12:15.443
-Shall I hear more, or shall I speak--
-Steve!

12:15.526 --> 12:17.070
-Hey! Who did that?
-What?

12:17.153 --> 12:20.114
[Steve growling, groaning]

12:20.198 --> 12:21.282
Your turn.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.118
Nope. Nope.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.370
Hey! Weirdo.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.413
-Any luck?
-Nope.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.706
Yeah, I struck out, too.

12:28.790 --> 12:32.168
I don't believe
that's appropriate school attire.

12:32.251 --> 12:36.172
-You, uh, try this out on Mr. Strickler?
-Come on. You really think he is one?

12:38.758 --> 12:41.177
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Now?
I don't want to embarrass ourselves.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.887
You just don't want to admit
that Strickler--

12:42.971 --> 12:45.431
I don't want you to upset anyone
who grades our final exams!

12:45.515 --> 12:47.475
Fine! Okay, we'll do it later.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.522
[school bell rings]

12:52.605 --> 12:54.399
Whoopsy! Slipped.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.902
-Sorry.
-Uh, mind picking that up for us, Mr. S?

12:58.569 --> 13:02.532
[scoffs] And waste such idle hands
as your own, Mr. Domzalski?

13:02.615 --> 13:08.830
Our backs. Coach Lawrence put us through
the wringer this morning. [chuckles]

13:08.955 --> 13:11.916
Here you go, Mr. Strickler.
Here's your horseshoe back.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.670
Thank you, Ms. NuÃ±ez,
but that belongs to Mr. Lake.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.589
Oh. Well, that would explain
the flying horseshoes.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.550
-So not going to ask.
-[chuckles]

13:21.926 --> 13:24.262
Take care of your back, Young Atlas.

13:24.345 --> 13:28.266
Such is the danger
of carrying the world on one's shoulders.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.019
-Very suspicious.
-Suspicious?

13:31.102 --> 13:32.979
-Claire.
-Still here.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.982
-What's up?
-You're still coming home with me, right?

13:36.065 --> 13:41.362
Oh, right! Claire and I are gonna
go to her house... for math stuff.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.614
-[laughing]
-[school bell rings]

13:43.698 --> 13:45.950
And, now, my horseshoe-shaped
little friend,

13:46.034 --> 13:49.328
we expose the definite changeling
in our midst.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.289
[slow music playing on radio]

13:51.372 --> 13:55.793
[humming, singing along in Spanish]

13:55.877 --> 13:57.754
-[continues singing]
-[groans]

13:59.255 --> 14:05.344
-[chuckles]
-[singing]

14:06.054 --> 14:11.017
[grunts]
It must work. Why aren't you working?

14:11.100 --> 14:11.934
[grunts]

14:12.018 --> 14:14.604
Why don't I take that, sweetie?
It's not very hygienic.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.482
<i>-Ay-yay-yay.</i>
-[drill whirring]

14:17.565 --> 14:19.942
-[music continues playing]
-[door bell rings]

14:20.651 --> 14:21.652
[Claire]
Hey!

14:22.528 --> 14:24.489
Nice, um, <i>casa.</i>

14:24.572 --> 14:27.700
Thanks. Make yourself at home.
I'm just making a little snack.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.869
-Uh, okay!
-[baby cooing]

14:29.952 --> 14:33.498
-Hey, and you must be Enrique.
-[cooing]

14:33.581 --> 14:35.375
-[dishes clattering]
-[chuckles]

14:38.378 --> 14:41.005
[whispering]
Enrique, hey! Look at this.

14:41.089 --> 14:46.177
For the Glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to make babies ogle.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.765
I hope you like guacamole. I put
a little milk in it. Secret family recipe.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.935
Wow! [chuckles]
He really likes you.

14:54.018 --> 14:58.022
Hoo! I've never seen a bathtub
of guacamole before.

14:58.106 --> 15:01.526
I wish! I would totally
take a bath in guac.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.653
It's so good!

15:04.862 --> 15:10.660
Mm! Oh, this is the best thing
I've ever had.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.953
You're not just saying that?

15:12.036 --> 15:16.874
You know what? I hang up my chef's hat.
You are the avocado master!

15:16.958 --> 15:19.752
-[both laugh]
-[cooing]

15:19.836 --> 15:21.087
[both laugh]

15:21.170 --> 15:22.547
[groans]

15:22.630 --> 15:25.758
Okay. Patient's ready for clean-up.
Good night, Gladys.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.177
Have a nice evening, Dr. Muelas.

15:29.554 --> 15:30.388
[sighs]

15:30.471 --> 15:33.182
[mumbling] Stupid horseshoe.
I really thought he would have been one.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.350
What's that, sweetie?

15:34.434 --> 15:38.563
Nothing. Wow, this novocaine you numbed
my mouth with is really strong.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.773
I can't even feel my hands.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.568
That's because I didn't inject you
with novocaine, dear.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.070
I hit you up with a potent paralyzer.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.738
Why would you do that?

15:47.822 --> 15:50.491
Well, it's not every day
someone comes in with a gaggletack.

15:50.575 --> 15:55.413
I had to do something to keep those
chubby, little legs from running away.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.331
[gasps, whimpers]

15:57.415 --> 16:00.334
[grunting, groaning]
Huh?

16:01.627 --> 16:02.753
[gasps]

16:03.838 --> 16:07.383
Oh, my! We have to get you
back in your seat.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.177
[screaming]

16:09.260 --> 16:12.305
-We have a lot of work to do.
-[screaming]

16:13.306 --> 16:15.099
[baby cooing]

16:15.183 --> 16:18.853
See, the equation only contains powers
of X that are non-negative integers.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.731
-Does that make sense?
-Is it supposed to?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.733
Nah. That's why it's called algebra.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.902
[both laugh]

16:25.985 --> 16:28.571
Hey, thanks again for this. I-I feel...

16:28.654 --> 16:31.449
I feel really bad about
what's happening with the play.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.368
I know it means a lot to you.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.621
You know, I was super mad at you,

16:36.704 --> 16:39.874
but then, I realized you've got
a lot more going on than people think.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.044
-I do. I do?
-Come on, Jim.

16:43.127 --> 16:46.380
You didn't think I invited you here
just for algebra, did you?

16:46.464 --> 16:47.757
Um...

16:47.840 --> 16:51.219
You can't just write a letter like this
and not expect a conversation.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.429
-[chuckles]
-You have to battle monsters?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.640
-"Saving the world in which we know"?
-Uh...

16:55.723 --> 16:57.767
-What monsters are you battling?
-Um...

16:57.850 --> 17:00.895
I mean, we all have stuff
we've got to go through.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.690
-But are you in some kind of trouble?
-I... Yeah! Metaphoric.

17:04.773 --> 17:09.362
I was... in an exploring stage.
Not successful.

17:09.444 --> 17:13.741
Your words are beautiful, Jim.
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

17:13.824 --> 17:14.992
I don't know.

17:15.076 --> 17:19.288
There's some sentimental stuff at the end
which I thought was... kinda sweet.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.205
Really?

17:20.289 --> 17:24.961
If you ever need someone to talk to
about "the monsters," you can talk to me.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.965
-It can be our secret.
-Uh... [chuckles]

17:29.048 --> 17:30.091
Yeah. [clears throat]

17:30.174 --> 17:32.343
[stammering]
That would be great.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.595
So, on to problem 42?
[chuckles]

17:35.555 --> 17:36.556
[Toby whimpering]

17:36.639 --> 17:38.849
Nomura warned me about you kids.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.894
Tell me, who else knows about the bridge?

17:41.978 --> 17:44.021
[screaming]

17:44.105 --> 17:46.816
That's why you're here
with a gaggletack, isn't it?

17:46.899 --> 17:50.278
-To find out what we've been up to?
-[murmuring incoherently]

17:50.361 --> 17:53.155
Don't evade. Who else knows
what we've been up to in Arcadia?

17:53.239 --> 17:54.407
[sobbing]

17:54.490 --> 17:59.245
Halt, changeling! Or else my giant friend
will tear you limb from limb!

17:59.328 --> 18:02.081
[grunting]
Maybe later.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.292
-[snarls]
-Um... [chuckles]

18:04.375 --> 18:06.586
[grunting, laughing]

18:07.753 --> 18:09.630
Oh, it burns!

18:09.714 --> 18:11.257
Oh, it's just a painting.
[chuckles]

18:11.340 --> 18:12.842
[yelps]

18:13.926 --> 18:15.052
-[grunts]
-[groans]

18:16.846 --> 18:18.764
[murmuring incoherently]

18:18.848 --> 18:20.308
[gasps, grunts]

18:20.391 --> 18:21.767
Prepare to meet doom!

18:22.560 --> 18:25.771
-[whirring stops]
-Aha! Not bad for a historian!

18:25.855 --> 18:28.649
[growls]

18:28.733 --> 18:29.692
[gasps]

18:30.985 --> 18:32.778
[snarls]

18:35.823 --> 18:37.992
-What's that?
-Laughing gas.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.910
[both laughing]

18:39.994 --> 18:41.537
Ooh! [laughing]

18:41.621 --> 18:44.040
[grunts, laughs]

18:44.123 --> 18:47.335
[all laughing]

18:47.418 --> 18:48.878
[Blinky]
You foul-mouthed wench!

18:50.129 --> 18:51.297
Hey! Ha!

18:52.256 --> 18:53.090
[vibrating]

18:53.174 --> 18:55.843
Have you thought about telling Ms. Janeth
about whatever you're going through?

18:55.926 --> 18:58.387
Maybe she'd reinstate you as Romeo
if she knew about it.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.641
Well, that could be...
It's really hard to explain.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.851
-[phone ringing, vibrating]
-Oh, one sec. Hello?

19:03.934 --> 19:07.355
-[Toby laughing, murmuring]
-Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.441
It's for you. Someone named Woby?

19:10.524 --> 19:11.484
Woby?

19:11.567 --> 19:13.569
[laughing]

19:13.653 --> 19:17.948
-[murmuring incoherently]
-[laughing continues]

19:18.783 --> 19:21.369
[sighs]
I have to go.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.412
Thanks for the guac.

19:26.457 --> 19:30.711
Fighting monsters again?
Who are you, Jim Lake?

19:30.795 --> 19:33.798
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

19:34.882 --> 19:37.468
-What in the world?
-Jimbo!

19:37.593 --> 19:38.594
Uh... [chuckles]

19:38.678 --> 19:41.055
The Trollhunter! Die!

19:42.264 --> 19:44.266
-[laughing]
-[yelps, groans]

19:44.350 --> 19:46.102
[laughs, growls]

19:47.269 --> 19:50.106
[groans, laughs]

19:52.441 --> 19:54.026
[snarls]

19:54.110 --> 19:55.444
[grunting]

19:55.528 --> 19:57.238
Perish, you worm!

20:00.533 --> 20:02.952
-[screams]
-Die!

20:03.035 --> 20:05.955
[grunts, gasps]

20:12.670 --> 20:14.672
[car alarm blaring]

20:14.755 --> 20:17.508
[breathing heavily]

20:17.591 --> 20:19.051
There goes proof.

20:19.135 --> 20:24.306
Oh, my gosh! She's in my mouth!
[coughs] Oh, my gosh!

20:24.390 --> 20:28.602
Oh, no! I killed our only evidence
of changelings in Arcadia.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.187
And my dental hygienist!

20:30.271 --> 20:33.983
You finished the fight, Master Jim,
and in self-defense, for that matter.

20:34.066 --> 20:38.362
Vendel may continue to have his doubts,
but we continue to have our lives.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.197
A fair bargain, I'd say.

20:40.281 --> 20:44.076
Just out of curiosity, what are you guys
doing in Toby's dentist's office?

20:44.160 --> 20:46.287
-[coughs]
-I thought it was possible that danger

20:46.370 --> 20:49.749
may come to either of you should you
cross paths with the wrong changeling.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.709
So, we followed Tobias as a precaution.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.502
[metal clattering]

20:53.586 --> 20:55.671
-And curious.
-About what?

20:55.755 --> 20:58.424
You humans have a concept
that is quite foreign to us.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.384
-[exhales] Oral hygiene.
-[coughing]

21:00.468 --> 21:01.719
-[laughing]
-[gags]

21:01.802 --> 21:06.432
Mm. Looks like we're officially out
of laughing gas. We should depart.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.268
-[grunts, groans]
-Hey!

21:09.351 --> 21:11.854
Uh, excuse me, wait! Look at this place.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.815
Do you have some magic artifact
that can clean up this mess?

21:14.899 --> 21:17.318
Yes. I believe it's called a "Tobias."

21:18.360 --> 21:20.196
I was afraid you'd say that.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.572
[grunting]

21:28.537 --> 21:30.414
-I've just confirmed the worst.
-[growls]

21:30.498 --> 21:32.166
Gladysgro has been slain.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.668
Well, then the impure served her purpose.

21:34.752 --> 21:38.714
She already brought us the stones
from Madagascar. Her job was done.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.509
I'd advise you to care
for those you employ.

21:41.592 --> 21:42.676
Care?

21:42.760 --> 21:44.512
I only care to find the stones

21:44.595 --> 21:47.306
so my father can escape
this wretched prison.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.851
Once we have them all,
I will crush this troll-pretender myself.

21:50.935 --> 21:54.730
And then, every fleshthing
in this horrid world will know...

22:04.907 --> 22:07.910
It appears Nomura has gotten her way.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.955
Another changeling has been chosen.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.706
[laughing]

22:12.790 --> 22:14.667
And look who it is.
