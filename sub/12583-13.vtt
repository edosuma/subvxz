00:31.031 --> 00:33.575


00:33.658 --> 00:37.620
I can't believe another Heimlich County
Pork Festival's almost here.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.205
This year we're gonna have to get

00:39.289 --> 00:41.666
Bill's cholesterol tested every hour.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.460
Just remember to keep your fingers

00:43.543 --> 00:45.253
away from my mouth.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.338
Once I'm in the zone,
I can't tell the difference.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.382
Hey, it's seven after the hour.

00:49.466 --> 00:52.260
Let's see what kind of weather
my Nancy's predicting.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.389
Even an inch tall and ashen gray,
she's beautiful.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.100
<i>The weather's gonna be sunny and clear,
not a chance of drizzle,</i>

00:59.184 --> 01:01.352
<i>so come on down
and watch those pigs sizzle.</i>

01:01.436 --> 01:02.771
<i>I'll be there to sign autographs</i>

01:02.854 --> 01:04.898
<i>outside the Hall of Ham Presidents.</i>

01:04.981 --> 01:06.149
All right!

01:06.232 --> 01:07.442


01:07.525 --> 01:09.277
I love James K. Pork.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.781
Thanks for your help, Peggy,

01:12.864 --> 01:15.033
but try not to sign across my face.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.285
Oh, and don't sign
across my cleavage either.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.246
Or, as one of my fans calls it,
my warm fronts.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.790
Oops.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.416
I must be getting tired.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.044
I signed this one "Peggy Hill" by mistake.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.171
Well, no matter,
now it's a collector's item.

01:28.797 --> 01:29.964
Can't stop yet, shug.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.341
The weather outlook is so sunny,

01:31.424 --> 01:34.135
we could be talking
demolition derby-size crowds.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.392
Did you realize I make your B's
just like a serial killer?

01:51.528 --> 01:54.656
Well, this ruins my water cooler talk
for Monday.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.074
And Tuesday.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.575
Delayed for wind?

01:57.659 --> 02:00.161
Sure, it's a little breezy,
but it's not that bad.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.959
Whoa!

02:17.679 --> 02:19.222
Nancy, fans!

02:21.599 --> 02:23.601
I look forward
to the Pork Festival all year

02:23.685 --> 02:25.562
and your weather ruined it!

02:26.146 --> 02:29.315
Can you accurately predict
what my finger's gonna do?

02:32.819 --> 02:34.904
It's not my fault I got the weather wrong.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.865
I just read it off the teleprompter.

02:36.948 --> 02:39.492
My job is to pronounce it, not predict it.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.327
Oh, don't feel so bad.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.621
You know what they say
about the weather in Texas...

02:43.705 --> 02:45.957
if you don't like it,
just wait five minutes.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.380
Sometimes it takes ten.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.134
Maybe we should go.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.141
We're square dancing in PE today.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.810
I'm do-si-do-ing with you, Cherise!

03:11.316 --> 03:13.651
You thought he was a dog.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.574
Oh, god, what a horrible day.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.993
At least it looks like you got
a nice new pair of boots.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.077
Thanks for noticing.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.039
Oh, can you ask me where I got them
from when we're on the air, shug?

03:26.122 --> 03:26.998
That way they're free.

03:27.081 --> 03:27.957
Understood.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.668
I get a free dinner every time
I mention the Barbecue Hut.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.170
Hmm.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.171
Damn it, Nancy.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.839
People are really ticked off
about your forecast.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.049
Our phones are ringing off the hook.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.342
What am I supposed to do?

03:37.425 --> 03:39.510
The only equipment I have is a thermometer

03:39.594 --> 03:40.595
and a little glass skunk

03:40.678 --> 03:42.180
whose tail turns blue when it's humid.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.140
I know, I know.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.060
Wait, what about the Super Doppler
we're always advertising?

03:47.143 --> 03:48.186
We don't really have one.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.813
We just wrote "Doppler"
on the air conditioning unit on the roof.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.273
Channel 4's got one.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.524
Televiso's got one.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.734
Well, we got to do something.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.277
The FCC's cracking down on everyone.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.112
They won't let us keep calling
it AccuWeather

03:58.196 --> 03:59.072
if you keep getting it wrong.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.075
Well, then get me a Doppler
or whatever can predict the weather better

04:02.158 --> 04:04.535
so I don't look like
a jackass again, shug!

04:17.465 --> 04:18.716
Hi, Bobby.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.884
What's the matter with you?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.553
It's Jimmy Bearden!

04:22.637 --> 04:24.847
I made eye contact with him one day,

04:24.931 --> 04:26.849
and ever since he's been out to get me.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.852
Do you hear the barking?

04:30.186 --> 04:31.813
It's all around us.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.610
Are the puffy clouds good or bad?

04:37.694 --> 04:38.861
Check it out, Nancy.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.947
Doppler radar. NWS link.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.949
Graphics computers. The works.

04:43.032 --> 04:46.411
Channel 84 is in the 21st century
of weather forecasting.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.662
Oh, thank God.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.585
Forecast for Arlen, please.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.507
Don't worry about how any
of this stuff works, Nancy.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.633
That's what Irv's here for.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.051
Meet Irv Bennett.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.846
Fresh from Texas Tech's
Meteorological School.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.556
Great to meet you, Ms. Hicks-Gribble.

05:06.639 --> 05:07.724
I know this is kind of lame,

05:07.807 --> 05:10.435
but I have a printout of that tornado
that moved through here

05:10.518 --> 05:11.728
in August of 2001.

05:11.811 --> 05:12.937
Could you sign it?

05:13.021 --> 05:14.188
Whatever, shug.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.983
I'm just glad I finally have someone
to do my science for me.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.192
Oh, and to answer my phone.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.611
Can you always say,
"I'll see if she's available"

05:20.695 --> 05:21.988
even when I am available.

05:22.071 --> 05:22.947
Can do.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.741
Uh, whoa, Irv,
you don't have time for that.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.075
Uh, sure he does.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.244
Don't let it get to five rings
or the voicemail will pick up.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.997
Just move it. You've got to get
into makeup for the five o'clock report.

05:31.080 --> 05:31.914
I'm on it.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.374
Makeup?

05:33.458 --> 05:34.751
Oh, don't worry, Tom.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.545
I'll make sure I don't walk so far
that he gets in the shot.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.671
Nancy, uh...

05:38.755 --> 05:41.341
Irv's gonna be doing
the weather from now on.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.342
What?

05:42.425 --> 05:43.343
Am I being fired?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.678
Now? Uh, no. We're a family.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.096
I'm sure we'll find something for you.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.474
But the thing is,
viewers don't wanna be entertained

05:49.557 --> 05:50.725
by a "weather girl" anymore.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.268
They... they want meteorologists

05:52.352 --> 05:53.811
who, who understand weather

05:53.895 --> 05:55.355
and can update them immediately.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.440
But... but what about me?

05:57.523 --> 05:59.817
Hey, why don't you man the weather phone?

05:59.901 --> 06:02.904
But everybody knows the weather phone's
just the fax machine.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.042
<i>You combine that split-level jet stream</i>

06:16.125 --> 06:18.419
<i>with a high pressure system
swooping down from Canada,</i>

06:18.503 --> 06:20.129
<i>and you've got classic tornado weather</i>

06:20.213 --> 06:21.506
<i>and possible wildfire conditions.</i>

06:21.589 --> 06:24.384
<i>I'll be tracking the developments
and keep you posted.</i>

06:24.467 --> 06:26.010
Weather can be tracked?

06:26.094 --> 06:26.969
He's good.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.931
<i>There are parts of this forest
that haven't seen rain...</i>

06:30.014 --> 06:33.393
Wow, zero percent chance
of charm or what, huh?

06:35.103 --> 06:37.939
How could we be defeated
by a man named Irv?

06:38.022 --> 06:39.440
Oh, would you calm down?

06:39.524 --> 06:42.735
Nancy, you may look like a Southern belle,

06:42.819 --> 06:45.571
but deep inside you are pure Rottweiler.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.740
Think of how many lives
you ruined in high school.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.326
Heck, I've seen you break up
entire baby showers

06:50.410 --> 06:51.702
with one catty remark.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.413
You're right.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.540
Irv's not gonna know what hit him.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.797
Steak's on.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.550
Bobby, what in the heck is wrong with you?

07:05.633 --> 07:07.760
Sorry, Dad.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.805
I'm just a little on edge
because of this bully at school.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.390
Well, what's he doing to you?

07:12.473 --> 07:14.559
Indian burns? Towel snaps?

07:14.642 --> 07:16.394
Those are the ones
you got to be careful of.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.063
No, he's jumping out and scaring me.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.773
Well, how's he doing that?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.150
Is he big for his age?

07:22.233 --> 07:24.819
Or does he have some of those
Chinese fighting sticks?

07:24.902 --> 07:27.738
No. He jumps out and makes a weird noise.

07:28.739 --> 07:29.782
Oh...

07:29.866 --> 07:32.577
Well, we're not going
to the principal on this one.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.079
Okay, we've been through this before.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.915
You need to fake with your right
and jab him with your left.

07:37.999 --> 07:38.833
Come on. Try it.

07:45.131 --> 07:49.218
Why don't you find his schedule
and try to stay away from him?

08:04.650 --> 08:06.319
Hey, there, Irv-y Derv.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.909
So you must have some wild stories

08:12.992 --> 08:14.827
about your days at Texas Tech.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.454
Ever have a few drinks,

08:16.537 --> 08:18.789
start roughhousing
with some of your frat brothers?

08:18.873 --> 08:20.791
Maybe in the shower...

08:22.418 --> 08:23.920
and things got a little out of hand?

08:26.005 --> 08:28.090
You remember when
that arctic air blast came through?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.843
You know, the one that had
all that heavy backlash precip behind it?

08:30.927 --> 08:33.262
Well, me and my buddies stood
outside all night long

08:33.346 --> 08:35.473
to understand what seven degrees
Fahrenheit felt like.

08:35.556 --> 08:36.516
I mean, sure,

08:36.599 --> 08:38.726
we could've just found
some walk-in freezer,

08:38.809 --> 08:40.228
but it's not the same.

08:43.814 --> 08:47.151
It must be nerve-wracking going on air
for the first time.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.569
Do you ever get scared

08:48.653 --> 08:50.446
that you will freeze up on camera

08:50.530 --> 08:54.158
and just stand there with nothing to say?

08:54.867 --> 08:57.912
Oh, there's always something to say
about the weather around here.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.206
Tornadoes, cyclones, floods,

09:00.289 --> 09:01.749
heatwaves, of course,

09:01.832 --> 09:03.167
not to mention hurricanes.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.460
Show time, Irv.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.670
All right!

09:14.345 --> 09:16.055
Oh, my god, your nose is huge.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.058
I do have a honker, don't I?

09:19.141 --> 09:20.476
You sure do.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.520
And the camera adds ten pounds,

09:22.603 --> 09:24.480
but I'm sure it won't all go to your nose.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.860
Whoo, it's gonna be
a hot one today, folks.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.113
So find some shade wherever you can.

09:32.196 --> 09:35.032
Hey, I bet my nose
could shade most of South Arlen.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.452
You might wanna back up camera one
'cause I'm about to turn here.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.872
I bet I'm a rhinoplastician's dream.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.085
Don't you mean rhinoceros?

09:46.168 --> 09:47.461
I mean rhinoplastician.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.506
You know... rhinoplasty?

09:51.841 --> 09:53.551
By a plastic surgeon?

09:55.219 --> 09:56.262
But with this nose,

09:56.345 --> 09:58.431
I'm probably a rhinoceros's dream, too.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.974
Good one.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.809
Give me five, Miguel.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.773
Huh... I never really knew what they meant

10:07.857 --> 10:09.066
when they said mild weather,

10:09.150 --> 10:11.986
but dang if it doesn't feel mild out here.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.571
Damn that Irv Bennett.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.573
It's like he makes the weather.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.242
Him and those damn machines of his.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.535
This guy's got to go.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.246
If he keeps this up,
they're gonna fire Nancy.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.664
If they fire Nancy,

10:23.748 --> 10:25.166
she won't be able to keep paying me

10:25.249 --> 10:26.792
to sit around the house and do nothing.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.586
You know, Dale, you could help out

10:28.711 --> 10:30.463
by cutting down on your expenses.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.423
Maybe instead of buying more guns,

10:32.506 --> 10:34.258
you can enjoy the ones you have.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.678
Or maybe I could just help Nancy
get rid of this guy.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.430
It's time to give him a scare

10:39.513 --> 10:41.891
like so many possums have given me.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.978
Last night I watched the news

10:46.062 --> 10:47.813
and pretended Irv and I were talking.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.316
He'd say, "How 'bout that weather?"

10:50.399 --> 10:52.193
and I'd say, "It's fine, Irv.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.153
Would you like some Swiss Miss pudding?"

11:00.576 --> 11:02.495
Iss-ton-bowl.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.121
Ees-tin-ball.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.915
Today the mayor of Ees-ton-bowl...

11:14.006 --> 11:15.383
Irv Bennett's desk.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.343
<i>Get out, weather man!</i>

11:17.426 --> 11:19.428
<i>A pain front is coming!</i>

11:19.512 --> 11:21.305
<i>Leave town!</i>

11:21.389 --> 11:23.307
-Dale?
-<i>Nancy?</i>

11:23.391 --> 11:24.767
What are you doing, Dale?

11:24.850 --> 11:26.310
<i>Getting rid of Irv for you.</i>

11:26.394 --> 11:28.020
<i>Could you leave a message I called?</i>

11:28.104 --> 11:30.356
<i>Not me, but "me"!</i>

11:30.439 --> 11:32.400
Attention, everybody. Irv just informed me

11:32.483 --> 11:33.526
we've got a wildfire!

11:33.609 --> 11:34.485
Now, listen up.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.487
I want us ready to go
to news team coverage

11:36.570 --> 11:37.780
as soon as this <i>Seinfeld</i> ends!

11:37.863 --> 11:40.032
Miguel, you'll lead and throw to Irv,
who'll be here in the studio.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.617
We need all hands on this one, people!

11:41.701 --> 11:42.702
Where do you want me?

11:42.785 --> 11:43.661
Uh, you can head home.

11:43.744 --> 11:44.662
We might need to use your desk

11:44.745 --> 11:46.872
in case the cameramen need
to sleep in shifts.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.672
Are those the pants you went to school in?

11:54.755 --> 11:55.798
No, Dad.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.968
Jimmy Bearden scared me,
and I peed myself,

11:59.051 --> 12:01.387
so they gave me "lost and found" pants.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.430
Are you happy?

12:02.513 --> 12:04.390
No. What happened?

12:05.433 --> 12:08.144
You know that little conveyor belt
in the cafeteria

12:08.227 --> 12:09.520
that takes your tray?

12:09.603 --> 12:10.813
He was on it!

12:11.981 --> 12:13.149
Get in the truck, Bobby.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.443
We're gonna fix your problem for good.

12:17.653 --> 12:18.946
Oh...

12:19.029 --> 12:20.656
Go change your pants, son.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.120
<i>And now Action News</i>

12:26.203 --> 12:28.038
<i>from Channel 84's news team.</i>

12:28.122 --> 12:29.457
<i>Miguel Hernandez,</i>

12:29.540 --> 12:31.292

12:31.375 --> 12:33.711
<i>and meteorologist Irv Bennett</i>

12:33.794 --> 12:35.838
<i>with the latest on the wildfires.</i>

12:35.921 --> 12:38.215
Oh, you call that a turnaround?

12:38.299 --> 12:41.177
Tell me, can that compare to this?

12:41.469 --> 12:42.303
Wow.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.472
That is almost too powerful in person.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.599
Oh, thanks, shug,

12:46.682 --> 12:48.684
but I know I'm finished as a weather gal.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.728
I don't even know
if I want to work in an industry

12:50.811 --> 12:52.062
that values brains over beauty.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.898
So you're just gonna give up?

12:53.981 --> 12:55.816
That's not the Nancy I know.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.276
When are you gonna learn

12:57.359 --> 12:59.195
that the real Doppler is in here?

12:59.278 --> 13:01.113
And that if you wanna keep your job,

13:01.197 --> 13:03.199
you're gonna have to do
everything in your power

13:03.282 --> 13:04.116
to fight for it.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.701
What do you mean? Kill Irv?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.703
No! Use the fire.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.121
-To kill Irv?
-No!

13:09.205 --> 13:12.541
Nancy, you cannot wait for them
to bring the news to you.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.710
You have to go out and find it.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.546
We'll go cover the fire
and force the station to see

13:17.630 --> 13:19.006
how much of an asset you are.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.674
Yeah.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.885
Dale! Get out of the hot tub!

13:22.968 --> 13:24.553
We're stealing a news van!

13:24.637 --> 13:26.347
It's the perfect crime!

13:26.430 --> 13:28.516
How will they ever report it?

13:29.099 --> 13:30.684
The thing is, Mr. Bearden,

13:30.768 --> 13:32.978
your son has left Bobby here,

13:33.062 --> 13:36.732
uh, severely startled
on several occasions.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.317
Where is Jimmy anyway?

13:38.400 --> 13:39.485
You didn't see him outside?

13:39.568 --> 13:41.570
He said he was going outside!

13:41.654 --> 13:43.614
I'm sorry, Mr. Hill.
He does the same thing to me.

13:43.697 --> 13:44.740
I can't help you.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.327
Okay, it looks like you've got
a straight shot to your truck.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.162
Watch out when you pass
that mailbox, though.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.623
That kid can wedge himself into anything.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.173
Gotcha!

14:07.179 --> 14:08.806
Okay. If we get stopped,

14:08.889 --> 14:10.432
Nancy, you work here,

14:10.516 --> 14:11.976
I'm looking for directions,

14:12.059 --> 14:15.229
and, Peggy, you're my shy assistant
with a speech impediment.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.230
Go!

14:31.161 --> 14:33.581
The scene here
is one of controlled frenzy.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.589
Hola, señor.

14:41.672 --> 14:46.093
I am Miguel Hernandez,
here to cover <i>el fuego des</i> wild.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.344
Perfect.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.554
Well, you know the drill.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.680
Stay in the media area.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.813
Oh, forget it, shugs.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.398
Everyone's already here.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.150
And Lucy Murphy from Channel 7

15:01.233 --> 15:02.568
is wearing the same jacket I am.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.029
What am I gonna get that they won't?

15:05.112 --> 15:06.405
You cannot give up now.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.282
We already stole a van.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.992
We have got more initiative.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.368
We are better than these sheep!

15:11.452 --> 15:14.496
Yeah, you can barely see
the fire from here.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.333
Let's go where you can
hardly see here from the fire!

15:17.499 --> 15:18.876
Oh, there's an access road.

15:18.959 --> 15:21.211
Drive up it real casual-like.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.212
Got ya.

15:29.970 --> 15:33.140
Oh, while those chumps
are down there looking at smoke,

15:33.223 --> 15:34.767
we'll be in the heart of the action.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.102
The forecast for my career...
hot, hot, hot!

15:37.269 --> 15:38.312
-You said it!
-Whoo-hoo!

15:38.395 --> 15:39.438
Whoo!

15:49.073 --> 15:50.574
I am so excited!

15:50.658 --> 15:52.701
They said I was just a flash in the pan.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.536
Well, now I am in the pan, shug.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.996
I am in the pan!

15:56.080 --> 15:59.375
People might lose their homes,
but you will get your job back.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.251
At least something good
will come out of this.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.837
It's like smoking every cigarette

16:03.921 --> 16:06.757
I've ever smoked all at once.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.471
And it's smooth.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.847
Oh, will you look?

16:13.931 --> 16:17.142
That eagle is carrying
that rabbit out of harm's way.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.561
Disaster brings out the best in everyone.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.690
Come on. Let's get broadcasting.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.775
Oh, my god! That tree's on fire!

16:24.858 --> 16:26.819
Nancy, go! Go stand in front of it!

16:31.907 --> 16:33.242
You're on!

16:37.663 --> 16:39.957
<i>No, this is not a home movie in hell.</i>

16:40.040 --> 16:41.875
<i>This is Nancy Hicks-Gribble reporting live</i>

16:41.959 --> 16:43.544
<i>from the scene of the Heimlich wildfire.</i>

16:43.627 --> 16:45.796
<i>Tonight's forecast is for the mid-70s</i>

16:45.879 --> 16:46.922
<i>in the tri-county area</i>

16:47.006 --> 16:49.591
<i>and the high 250s near here
in the heart of the blaze.</i>

16:52.928 --> 16:56.598
-<i>The fire is being fueled
by extraordinarily dry conditions.</i>

16:56.682 --> 16:59.101
<i>In fact, there are parts of this forest
that haven't seen...</i>

16:59.184 --> 17:00.686
What's Nancy doing out there?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.022
<i>As you can see behind me...</i>

17:03.105 --> 17:05.441
as well as in front of me,
and on either side,

17:05.524 --> 17:08.360
<i>what once was mere heat
is now actual fire.</i>

17:08.444 --> 17:10.070
<i>Oh, oh, oh...</i>

17:10.154 --> 17:13.073
<i>As our more observant viewers
can probably hear,</i>

17:13.157 --> 17:14.825
<i>I'm having trouble breathing
with all the smoke.</i>

17:14.908 --> 17:16.285
<i>And my tongue has dried out.</i>

17:16.368 --> 17:17.745
<i>It's starting to stick to my teeth.</i>

17:18.328 --> 17:21.040
Either my eye or my eyepiece is melting!

17:22.541 --> 17:25.085
<i>Oh, well, that's probably
Mother Nature's way</i>

17:25.169 --> 17:26.462
<i>of giving us the wrap-it-up sign.</i>

17:26.545 --> 17:28.088
<i>This has been Nancy Hicks-Gribble...</i>

17:28.172 --> 17:30.716
No! No, not "has been," "still is"!

17:30.799 --> 17:31.884
Keep going, Nancy!

17:31.967 --> 17:33.302
We need our money shot!

17:37.097 --> 17:39.016
There's your money shot. Happy?

17:39.099 --> 17:40.809
Okay, let's get to the van.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.728
But we have to keep rolling, people!

17:43.937 --> 17:46.190
How do we get this on there?

17:46.273 --> 17:48.358
And that off there?

17:49.735 --> 17:52.905
We interrupt our Wildfire Watch coverage
to bring you...

17:52.988 --> 17:54.823
<i>Really? I thought she was at home.</i>

17:54.907 --> 17:56.492
<i>To put it in layman's terms,</i>

17:56.575 --> 17:58.744
<i>imagine crawling in your own fireplace</i>

17:58.827 --> 17:59.703
<i>while it's burning.</i>

17:59.787 --> 18:01.789
I wanna see this footage
on every promo from now

18:01.872 --> 18:03.165
until the Christmas toy drive.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.334
And someone probably should tell
the fire department about them.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.251
<i>Nancy,</i>

18:06.335 --> 18:07.461
<i>the van's on fire!</i>

18:07.544 --> 18:08.420
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

18:08.504 --> 18:09.588
Show it...

18:11.465 --> 18:12.633
Show it...

18:14.176 --> 18:15.427
Yes!

18:15.511 --> 18:16.512
-Whoo!
-All right!

18:20.349 --> 18:21.225
Goddangit!

18:21.308 --> 18:22.184
How'd we lose them?

18:22.267 --> 18:23.602
The van exploded.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.354
I... I could drive another van up there!

18:25.437 --> 18:27.439
We already have another van
in the media area.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.733
Uplink it! I wanna be seeing fire,
not hearing you.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.488
The fire's everywhere, shug!

18:34.571 --> 18:36.240
We're never gonna get out!

18:36.323 --> 18:37.658
Oh, god!

18:37.741 --> 18:40.410
Baby, I always hoped we'd die together.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.038
Peggy, you go die over there.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.957
I don't wanna die!

18:45.040 --> 18:47.126
I just wanna read the weather!

18:47.209 --> 18:48.627
Oh, don't be silly.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.546
We can't die if we're on TV.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.797
They'd never air it!

18:51.880 --> 18:54.133
I don't care anymore!

18:54.216 --> 18:56.176
I'm scared!

18:56.260 --> 18:59.555
And I don't wanna go to heaven
with brown roots!

19:02.349 --> 19:03.183
We've got picture!

19:05.269 --> 19:06.854


19:09.273 --> 19:11.275
Whoa! Gimme five.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.236
-Gimme five?
-<i>Get me out of here.</i>

19:15.279 --> 19:18.073
The Arlen and McMaynerbury
Fire Departments report

19:18.157 --> 19:19.825
that during the containment of the blaze,

19:19.908 --> 19:21.243
several horses in the area...

19:21.326 --> 19:23.120
-<i>had to be airlifted out.</i>
-<i>All right!</i>

19:23.203 --> 19:24.496
<i>In a related story,</i>

19:24.580 --> 19:26.331
<i>so did our own</i><i>Nancy Hicks-Gribble.</i>

19:37.551 --> 19:40.304
Now, son, you can't keep
scaring people like this.

19:40.387 --> 19:43.056
Pretty soon you'll be too big
to squeeze into the ductwork.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.396
Bwaagh!

19:51.440 --> 19:53.775
So are you gonna stop scaring my boy?

19:53.859 --> 19:56.612
'Cause I've got a wife
who likes to hide and yell, too.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.325
Well, I'm glad
you learned your lesson, Jimmy.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.369
Oh, crap.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.579
Where'd he go?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.333
<i>I don't wanna die.</i>

20:09.416 --> 20:11.627
<i>I just wanna read the weather.</i>

20:11.710 --> 20:13.545
You steal a news van,

20:13.629 --> 20:15.088
a bunch of equipment,

20:15.172 --> 20:16.381
and destroy it all.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.925
I feel so stupid.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.177
I wish I was in that van when it exploded.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.346
Are you kidding?
You put Channel 84 on the map.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.806
We've got more requests
for that footage of you blubbering

20:24.890 --> 20:27.309
-than of that panda baby at the zoo.
-Really?

20:27.392 --> 20:29.853
I wanna reposition Nancy Hicks-Gribble

20:29.937 --> 20:32.189
as an integral part
of the Channel 84 team.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.274
-So, I'm back on weather?
-No.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.861
Uh, it turns out people really do care
about accurate weather.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.071
Irv's not gonna go anywhere,

20:39.154 --> 20:40.822
but people did respond to you.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.324
What's left for me to do?

20:42.407 --> 20:44.743
I don't know. News?

20:44.826 --> 20:46.662
So it looks like the Arlen Jaycees

20:46.745 --> 20:48.705
are gonna be having
that potato-sack race indoors.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.375
Now, I'd like to welcome
a new addition to the anchor desk,

20:51.458 --> 20:53.001
but it's a face you already know.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.004
Say hello to our new co-anchor,
Nancy Hicks-Gribble.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.297
Thanks, Irv.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.549
It's great to be a part of the team, shug.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.010
Have you been feeling itchy lately?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.804
We may have the reason why.

21:05.013 --> 21:08.308
It has nothing to do
with the Barbecue Hut off I-10.
