01:26.461 --> 01:27.462
Open.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.008
Hello?

01:34.719 --> 01:35.970
Is it twisty?

01:51.152 --> 01:54.280
Yes! I knew it. Okay.

01:55.824 --> 01:56.658
No!

02:12.507 --> 02:14.342
You've reached
Bethany. Leave a message.

02:14.425 --> 02:15.404
Now, what do I...

02:15.521 --> 02:20.276
Mom, I'm hungry. I can't
get the pascetti bits open.

02:23.195 --> 02:24.697
Where are you?

03:08.783 --> 03:10.534
Mmm, delicious.

03:26.967 --> 03:28.719
Oh, what's that, Emily?

03:28.803 --> 03:31.847
You're upset that I knocked your
toothbrush in the trash can again?

03:31.931 --> 03:35.434
Well, too bad! Who do you think
you are, the toothbrush police?

03:35.518 --> 03:39.146
Oh, toothbrush burn!
High-five, Uncle Jim.

03:42.274 --> 03:43.984
It's a pretty good one. Right, Mom?

03:48.239 --> 03:49.490
It was a good one.

04:04.922 --> 04:07.466
Faster, Uncle Jim! Faster! Giddy up!

04:44.253 --> 04:45.129
Uncle Jim?

04:46.964 --> 04:49.884
I was clearly ringing for Bethany.

04:49.967 --> 04:52.219
Bethany! Get out here!

04:52.303 --> 04:54.680
Bethany, I'm starving!

04:54.763 --> 04:56.765
- Bethany!
- She's gone.

04:58.392 --> 05:01.312
Gone? What am I supposed to eat?

05:02.062 --> 05:04.356
I have pascetti bits. Can I come in?

05:04.440 --> 05:08.944
The audacity! After what you did to me?

05:09.028 --> 05:15.159
I put all of me into you
and this is how you repay me?

05:15.242 --> 05:18.162
No, Miranda, you can't come in my house.

05:18.245 --> 05:22.208
I wouldn't invite you in if
you were the last person...

05:22.291 --> 05:23.834
The video went viral.

05:25.419 --> 05:27.546
Welcome. Welcome.

05:30.925 --> 05:32.885
Well, I'd offer you a refreshment,

05:32.968 --> 05:34.470
but I've already gone
through all that stuff.

05:35.554 --> 05:36.889
What's that doing here?

05:36.972 --> 05:39.058
Oh, Patrick sold it to me
the night I moved in here.

05:39.141 --> 05:41.226
I guess he didn't need it anymore.

05:41.310 --> 05:42.978
But I couldn't really
understand what he was saying,

05:43.062 --> 05:44.146
because he was crying so much.

05:44.813 --> 05:47.274
I guess he really loved that bike.

05:47.358 --> 05:49.920
Anyways, about this
video that went viral.

05:49.927 --> 05:52.369
Which one did you say it was again?

05:52.446 --> 05:53.948
The one you posted.

05:54.531 --> 05:58.452
Oh, the one I posted. The
one you told me not to?

05:59.203 --> 06:00.162
Yes.

06:00.245 --> 06:05.417
Is this is the same video
that you fired me for posting?

06:05.501 --> 06:06.502
Yeah, so?

06:07.044 --> 06:10.798
It seems like someone would
like to give someone an apology

06:10.881 --> 06:13.467
and beg me to be their manager again.

06:15.386 --> 06:16.387
Anytime you want.

06:16.470 --> 06:18.889
I'm waiting. I'm
waiting for the apology.

06:21.225 --> 06:23.602
"Will..." You can say it.

06:24.687 --> 06:25.688
"Will..."

06:26.647 --> 06:27.731
"Will..."

06:27.815 --> 06:33.570
"Will you be my manager again?"

06:35.155 --> 06:37.658
That was a very nice apology, Miranda.

06:40.327 --> 06:42.329
Well, will you?

06:44.790 --> 06:48.127
Get me the pascetti bits.
We're back in business.

07:23.027 --> 07:26.168
_

07:35.382 --> 07:39.636
I told you this would
work. Over 200,000 views?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.555
And look at all these comments.

07:41.638 --> 07:43.057
You've got mail.

07:43.140 --> 07:46.769
The computer can talk now, but
he has a very limited vocabulary.

07:46.852 --> 07:48.354
You've got mail.

07:48.437 --> 07:51.732
I'm trying to teach it more.
Watch this. Polly want a cracker?

07:51.815 --> 07:52.983
You've got mail.

07:53.901 --> 07:55.027
He's still learning.

07:55.110 --> 08:00.657
Wow. Look at all these e-mails!
A comedy club wants to book you.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.285
Pass! Who do we look like, Bazooka Joe?

08:03.369 --> 08:04.536
Oh, yeah. Pass!

08:05.371 --> 08:07.456
- A bar mitzvah?
- Pass!

08:08.874 --> 08:11.001
Oh. Hold on.

08:11.085 --> 08:15.214
"Dear Miranda, I think you're
fabulous. I'm Sam Crusoe,

08:15.297 --> 08:20.260
the producer of a show on
Broadway called Wrap Party.

08:20.344 --> 08:23.222
If you're ever in New York
City, you should come by.

08:23.305 --> 08:26.141
We'd love to have you."

08:26.892 --> 08:28.644
- Pass!
- No, no, no, no, no.

08:29.228 --> 08:30.896
I think I know what this is.

08:34.316 --> 08:38.821
Ooh, I knew it! Wrap Party
is where legends are born.

08:38.904 --> 08:42.116
Wait, what? "Legends"? I
thought legends weren't real.

08:42.198 --> 08:44.076
Like mermaids, leprechauns,

08:44.159 --> 08:45.786
- zebras, Canadians...
- No, no, no.

08:45.869 --> 08:48.997
Okay, Miranda. Legends
are better than real.

08:49.081 --> 08:50.999
They're better than being famous.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.752
Right now, you're just
a boring famous person.

08:53.836 --> 08:56.296
But you could be a legend.

08:56.380 --> 08:59.258
We need to get you to Broadway.

09:03.095 --> 09:04.388
What the heck?

09:04.471 --> 09:06.765
Put all your loose change in here.

09:06.849 --> 09:09.601
This is our Broadway
fund. All the loose change.

09:09.685 --> 09:11.854
- Oh, okay.
- All your loose change!

09:11.937 --> 09:14.314
All the loose change!
This is the Broadway fund!

09:14.398 --> 09:15.632
Get quarters. Can you find any quarters?

09:15.747 --> 09:16.531
Quarters? Quarters.

09:16.608 --> 09:19.361
- Found a penny!
- It's a quarter!

09:19.445 --> 09:21.989
- Scream if there's a quarter!
- A quarter? A quarter!

09:22.072 --> 09:24.324
- A quarter! A quarter! More quarters!
- A quarter!

09:27.453 --> 09:30.247
- Almost there.
- Almost.

09:30.330 --> 09:35.085
We just gotta fill this bucket up,
and then we're off to New York City.

09:36.879 --> 09:38.589
Let's go get my roadie.

09:41.258 --> 09:42.926
I'm glad we worked things out.

09:44.052 --> 09:48.015
I didn't think it would
happen so quickly, but...

09:49.683 --> 09:50.767
here you are.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.470
Well, you posted this stuff at such a

09:53.477 --> 09:55.487
great price, I had to jump on it quick.

09:56.106 --> 09:58.817
Though, are you sure you
don't want these anymore?

09:58.901 --> 10:02.279
No, these particular props
have lost their luster for me.

10:02.362 --> 10:03.989
Okay.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.409
- Oh, excuse you!
- Oh, sorry.

10:07.493 --> 10:09.786
- Excuse you! Thank you for nothing.
- Sorry.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.841
Patrick's cleaning lady's got some sass.

10:11.887 --> 10:12.707
Yeah.

10:13.081 --> 10:15.000
Patrick, I have some good news for you.

10:15.083 --> 10:17.085
My boyfriend married someone else,

10:17.169 --> 10:19.671
I was laughed offstage and
then left crying in the rain.

10:19.755 --> 10:21.924
So I'm available.

10:22.508 --> 10:25.427
Also, we're going to give you
your roadie job back, so...

10:26.053 --> 10:28.464
I've drafted up this standard contract.

10:28.471 --> 10:31.189
It's, uh, boilerplate stuff, really.

10:31.266 --> 10:32.267
No need to read it over.

10:32.351 --> 10:34.394
Just sign at the bottom,
and we'll get to work.

10:35.270 --> 10:36.313
No, thank you.

10:37.814 --> 10:39.233
Why are you being so awnry?

10:40.567 --> 10:41.860
I don't know what that means.

10:41.944 --> 10:43.237
What do you mean you
don't know what it means?

10:43.320 --> 10:44.571
It's a word. "Awnry."

10:44.655 --> 10:46.114
- Awnry.
- "Awnry"?

10:46.198 --> 10:48.033
- Awnry.
- Yeah, awnry.

10:48.116 --> 10:50.327
Patrick, listen, I'm about
to show you something,

10:50.410 --> 10:52.371
and I don't know if your
little heart can handle it.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.626
Lookee, lookee, Patrick!

10:57.709 --> 11:00.504
Twenty-one hundred and thirty...

11:00.587 --> 11:02.297
and... views.

11:02.381 --> 11:04.967
So, weed 'em and reap.

11:05.050 --> 11:07.302
You could be working with
a celebrity if you just...

11:16.061 --> 11:18.939
Patrick, if you
don't sign this right now,

11:19.022 --> 11:22.901
we are going to go with one of
our many, many other options.

11:23.610 --> 11:24.778
I'm serious.

11:26.697 --> 11:27.823
So, going once...

11:29.324 --> 11:30.909
Going twice...

11:34.538 --> 11:35.497
And we're walking.

11:37.416 --> 11:38.583
We're walking.

11:39.501 --> 11:40.836
We're walking.

11:40.919 --> 11:42.713
And you'll never see us again.

12:12.868 --> 12:15.203
Welcome to the Bible Adventure Museum.

12:15.287 --> 12:17.831
Enjoy your stay and have fun.

12:40.228 --> 12:43.357
I am David, a
lowly shepherd boy who took down

12:43.440 --> 12:46.026
the Philistine giant
Goliath with a slingshot

12:46.109 --> 12:49.029
before beheading him with his own sword.

12:49.821 --> 12:51.573
Prayer can fix anything.

12:52.157 --> 12:53.533
What do you pray about?

12:55.660 --> 12:57.621
Cool. Me too!

13:12.719 --> 13:14.763
I have to get Miranda to Broadway,

13:14.846 --> 13:19.601
but she's not going to go along with
this unless we do it right, okay?

13:19.684 --> 13:22.562
"I'm Miranda, and I'm on the stage,

13:22.646 --> 13:25.399
and you're filling the air
with beautiful bubbles."

13:25.482 --> 13:26.483
Perfect!

13:26.942 --> 13:30.612
- You, sir, you have a gift.
- What are you doing?

13:30.695 --> 13:32.697
Oh, Miranda, I didn't see you there.

13:32.781 --> 13:35.575
I'm just working with my
spectacular new roadie.

13:37.411 --> 13:38.578
- Is he sleeping?
- Wake up!

13:39.579 --> 13:41.665
He can do anything.

13:41.748 --> 13:45.085
Dancing, magic, fan waving...

13:45.836 --> 13:47.712
He's just like Patrick, only better.

13:47.796 --> 13:50.090
- Just like Patrick?
- Just look at him.

13:50.173 --> 13:53.301
Patrick would be so
jealous if he met this guy.

13:53.385 --> 13:56.346
Jealous, huh? You don't say.

13:57.848 --> 13:59.141
Perfect.

13:59.224 --> 14:04.104
Okay, everyone, big smiles for
Jesus. We all know what happens next.

14:05.021 --> 14:06.106
There we go.

14:07.315 --> 14:08.733
Yeah. Pensive.

14:10.527 --> 14:11.528
Oh.

14:13.071 --> 14:13.989
Miss?

14:14.072 --> 14:16.324
Oh, am I doing the wrong pose?

14:16.408 --> 14:19.911
Well, no, it's not that. It's
just that this is their photo.

14:19.995 --> 14:21.455
We can take yours in just a second.

14:21.538 --> 14:23.123
Why don't you pick a
picture from the binder,

14:23.206 --> 14:24.040
and I'll be right with you?

14:24.124 --> 14:25.584
Okay. I'm sorry.

14:26.209 --> 14:28.128
- It's okay. All right.
- Okay.

14:28.211 --> 14:31.047
Judas, I'm going to need you
looking a lot more guilty.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.132
There it is.

14:32.716 --> 14:33.717
Oh.

14:34.217 --> 14:36.762
What a handsome family.
You guys did a great job.

14:36.845 --> 14:40.307
Don't forget, we take cash,
credit, frankincense and myrrh.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.145
Hi. Thanks for waiting.

14:45.228 --> 14:46.563
- Yeah.
- What can I do for you?

14:46.646 --> 14:48.398
I'd like to take that picture.

14:48.482 --> 14:50.734
Okay. When does the rest
of your party arrive?

14:51.693 --> 14:53.278
Oh, it's just me.

14:54.196 --> 14:55.614
Right. Okay, uh...

14:55.697 --> 14:59.367
Perhaps I could interest you in
one of these single-person options.

14:59.868 --> 15:02.829
Oh, this is a great one. "The
Stoning of the Prostitute."

15:02.913 --> 15:06.708
No, no. You know what? I
would like "The Last Supper."

15:06.792 --> 15:09.336
Okay. Right. If we did that one, um...

15:10.295 --> 15:11.963
it just wouldn't make sense, uh,

15:12.047 --> 15:14.925
because you don't have a bunch
of family or friends here, so...

15:15.008 --> 15:19.054
Listen, I came here because I
wanted to do something for myself.

15:19.137 --> 15:23.141
And what I'm realizing is that
myself wants a big family portrait.

15:23.225 --> 15:26.394
So I'm gonna do a big
family portrait by myself.

15:35.654 --> 15:37.447
Don't wanna go to New York with me, huh?

15:37.531 --> 15:41.368
That's all right. I hired a new
roadie, and he's even better than you.

15:41.451 --> 15:42.536
Roadie, Popsicle!

15:45.831 --> 15:47.499
What you think about that?

15:49.334 --> 15:50.502
I'm happy for you.

15:53.797 --> 15:55.257
Mmm!

15:55.340 --> 15:59.135
So melty and delicious.
Mmm! My favorite.

16:00.303 --> 16:02.224
This is so much better
than any Popsicles

16:02.254 --> 16:04.128
that other roadie always gave me.

16:07.602 --> 16:09.688
Mmm!

16:15.986 --> 16:17.362
It's so good.

16:24.703 --> 16:25.954
Mmm!

16:33.086 --> 16:34.421
You're supposed to pick it up.

16:35.630 --> 16:36.715
Look at that.

16:37.632 --> 16:39.259
No, no, no! You're not
supposed to throw it away!

16:39.342 --> 16:42.012
You're supposed to stick it to the
wall and make a thingy out of it!

16:42.095 --> 16:45.807
No, not that wall. What are you
doing? Stop. Just get out. Get out!

16:45.891 --> 16:49.019
- Idiot.
- Miranda, I think you should go, too.

17:04.159 --> 17:05.160
Dang it!

17:07.369 --> 17:08.496
One second.

17:14.002 --> 17:15.002
Lookee, lookee.

17:17.213 --> 17:18.632
No.

17:31.519 --> 17:32.938
Now. Perfect.

17:35.982 --> 17:36.983
Hey...

17:41.571 --> 17:44.783
Ha! See? We can make a new one.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.440
Patrick?

18:22.821 --> 18:23.697
Fine!

18:32.998 --> 18:34.874
Come on, Uncle Jim! We're
going to the airport!

18:34.958 --> 18:36.418
I want to go to Broadway now!

18:37.002 --> 18:39.421
What the heck? This
isn't even close to full.

18:39.504 --> 18:40.922
Oh, I've been waiting forever!

18:41.006 --> 18:42.340
How much longer is this gonna take?

18:42.424 --> 18:46.511
Miranda, you are in luck, because
I filled this up earlier today.

18:46.594 --> 18:49.389
Are you blind? That's
not even close to full.

18:49.472 --> 18:51.266
Look what I just got in the mail.

18:51.933 --> 18:53.059
Just pay with that.

18:53.143 --> 18:54.916
I would do it myself,
but I am currently,

18:54.962 --> 18:56.691
and unjustly, on the no-fly list.

18:56.730 --> 18:59.941
So I will be traveling
by way of suitcase.

19:04.237 --> 19:07.282
Just act like there's
not a folded-up uncle in here.

19:07.365 --> 19:08.366
Be quiet!

19:18.293 --> 19:20.837
Hi. I would like three...

19:20.920 --> 19:23.423
No, two tickets to New York, please.

19:23.506 --> 19:26.843
Oh, and also, I will be
paying with this credit card.

19:29.512 --> 19:31.556
Miss, is this some kind of a joke?

19:31.639 --> 19:34.309
- What?
- Your name is "Valued Customer"?

19:34.392 --> 19:36.728
Well, it depends. Is that
what it says on the card?

19:37.353 --> 19:39.481
It's the name on all sample cards.

19:39.564 --> 19:41.524
Okay. Well, then, yes. That's my name.

19:42.734 --> 19:45.320
We don't take, uh, credit
cards made of heavy paper here.

19:45.945 --> 19:47.781
Do you have another payment method?

19:48.281 --> 19:50.950
- Um, I...
- Psst. Hey, Miranda.

19:51.034 --> 19:55.914
Oh, yes, I do. Do you take
checks made of heavy paper?

19:55.997 --> 19:58.208
- Yes. Yes, we do.
- Good.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.753
And your bag is overweight.

20:01.836 --> 20:03.254
How dare you!

20:03.338 --> 20:04.923
You might want to take
some stuff out of it

20:05.006 --> 20:07.133
and transfer it to your other suitcases.

20:07.217 --> 20:08.301
'Kay.

20:09.177 --> 20:10.470
I need some stuff out of here.

20:11.805 --> 20:12.931
Come on, Uncle Jim, hurry up.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.727
How heavy is it now?

20:18.812 --> 20:20.647
- Still too heavy.
- What?

20:20.730 --> 20:23.858
Looks like we need to take
more stuff out of this bag!

20:23.942 --> 20:25.568
- All I have is what I'm wearing.
- Do it.

20:26.402 --> 20:27.654
Here, deal with this.

20:33.993 --> 20:35.620
Hurry up, Uncle Jim.
Give me your clothes.

20:35.703 --> 20:37.205
Don't mess this up for me!

20:38.540 --> 20:40.333
Hello, this is check-in desk five.

20:40.416 --> 20:43.169
We have some suspicious
activity and weapons.

20:43.253 --> 20:45.343
So do I just make
that out to "Airplane"?

20:45.365 --> 20:47.404
How do you spell that? A-R...

20:47.465 --> 20:48.842
Uh, I'm gonna need you
to stand to the side

20:48.925 --> 20:51.594
until security can escort
you off the premises.

20:51.678 --> 20:53.680
Wait, security? No. No,
just give me my ticket!

20:53.763 --> 20:55.014
I'm not selling you a ticket.

20:55.098 --> 20:56.078
I need you and your friend to move over

20:56.085 --> 20:57.189
to the side and wait for security.

20:57.267 --> 20:59.602
No, please! I have to go to New York!

21:00.145 --> 21:02.509
Ma'am, I'm not selling you a ticket.

21:03.189 --> 21:04.399
- Um...
- Thank you, sir.

21:04.482 --> 21:06.526
Here's your ticket. And departures
are right through these doors.

21:07.944 --> 21:10.029
Okay. Whatever you say, sir.

21:10.113 --> 21:12.991
I'll just walk over here,
minding my own business.

21:15.910 --> 21:17.579
Security, stop her!

21:17.662 --> 21:18.663
No, stop. Please!

21:18.746 --> 21:20.456
I have to go to Broadway
to become a legend!

21:20.540 --> 21:21.791
We're not letting her on that plane.

21:21.875 --> 21:24.377
No, you don't understand what
I've been through to get here!

21:24.460 --> 21:27.380
My mom is gone. I lost my
boyfriend. I folded up my uncle.

21:27.463 --> 21:29.799
And if you stop me,
it'll all be for nothing!

21:29.883 --> 21:32.302
Now, let me on that plane.
My fans are expecting me.

21:32.927 --> 21:33.761
What fans?

21:35.430 --> 21:36.639
I have lots of fans.

21:37.932 --> 21:39.475
Raise your hand if you're a fan!

21:41.227 --> 21:42.061
Hello?

21:44.105 --> 21:45.106
Please?

21:46.941 --> 21:47.942
Anyone?

21:48.651 --> 21:50.069
Get her out of here.

22:05.376 --> 22:06.586
Did we make it?

22:14.594 --> 22:16.679
Hey! Are you Miranda Sings?

22:17.972 --> 22:19.849
Yes, what do you want?

22:19.933 --> 22:21.267
Oh, my gosh!

22:21.351 --> 22:23.978
I'm, like, your biggest
fan. I watch you on YouTube!

22:40.161 --> 22:42.455
Miranda! Now's your chance!

22:45.917 --> 22:47.126
Broadway.

22:54.217 --> 22:55.969
Go, Miranda! Go!

23:00.264 --> 23:03.059
You did it! You're going to Broadway!

23:03.142 --> 23:04.477
I did it!

23:06.562 --> 23:08.272
She did it.

23:15.029 --> 23:19.075
You know, I tried to tell her I
was sick, but she just didn't care.

23:19.784 --> 23:23.037
And then I left, and it
wasn't until that I got here

23:23.121 --> 23:24.998
that I felt really good about leaving.

23:25.832 --> 23:29.544
But now I feel this emptiness again.

23:29.627 --> 23:30.837
- Do you know what I mean?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:30.920 --> 23:34.007
And I just keep thinking that
my daughter's probably in danger.

23:34.090 --> 23:36.175
She always sets herself up for failure.

23:36.259 --> 23:37.677
She thinks she has this talent.

23:37.684 --> 23:40.060
And it's not going
to go anywhere, and...

23:40.138 --> 23:42.390
she doesn't have very
good street smarts, and...

23:42.473 --> 23:45.393
Well, if your family needs
you, you should go to them.

23:45.476 --> 23:48.187
Yeah, but it's just more
complicated than that.

23:49.522 --> 23:51.274
Well, what do I know, right?

23:52.066 --> 23:52.984
I'm just a guy.

24:01.576 --> 24:02.577
You, uh...

24:03.202 --> 24:05.288
Are you gonna come
watch me get crucified?

24:07.248 --> 24:09.751
No. My daughter needs me.

24:22.180 --> 24:24.390
- Miranda and Jim?
- Uncle Jim.

24:24.974 --> 24:28.436
Right. You guys are free to go.
There's someone waiting for you outside.

24:28.519 --> 24:29.979
He cleared the whole thing up.

24:30.063 --> 24:33.399
I was wrongfully put on
the no-fly list a couple of years ago.

24:33.483 --> 24:35.735
I was wondering if you could
make that go away as well?

24:36.736 --> 24:37.695
Get out of here.

24:41.699 --> 24:43.659
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where do
you think you're going, pal?

24:43.743 --> 24:45.328
No one vouched for you. Sit down.

24:54.212 --> 24:55.338
Patrick?

24:56.464 --> 24:57.882
I saw you on the news.

24:59.842 --> 25:03.638
And I'm concerned about your
current roadie's swordsmanship.

25:03.721 --> 25:05.640
He has a very weak offensive thrust.

25:05.723 --> 25:09.852
Patrick, you know it's not polite
to talk about another man's thrust.

25:10.561 --> 25:12.105
Miranda's a celebrity now.

25:12.688 --> 25:14.690
And she's gonna need adequate security.

25:15.608 --> 25:19.403
Mr. Uncle, I'd like to reapply
for the roadie position.

25:22.573 --> 25:23.491
You're hired.

25:24.117 --> 25:25.660
And from one man to another,

25:26.285 --> 25:28.412
I've always liked your thrust, Patrick.

25:36.337 --> 25:37.213
Hi.

25:39.132 --> 25:40.007
Hi.

25:49.475 --> 25:53.688
I feel like you should know...

25:59.235 --> 26:02.488
that I think we need to keep
this strictly professional.

26:20.798 --> 26:21.757
Mom?
