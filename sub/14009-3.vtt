you suggesting?</i>

00:26.681 --> 00:27.629
<i>BOORMAN: Redeploy him.</i>

<i>CARTER: So what do we do now?</i>

00:28.722 --> 00:29.911
<i>Look for some mullah
that doesn't exist?</i>

00:29.978 --> 00:31.909

<i>HEWES: And what would you do
if you could find the resources?</i>

00:40.772 --> 00:41.817
<i>PARSONS: I'd try the case.</i>

00:41.920 --> 00:44.927
<i>HEWES: Use my
firm, my resources.</i>

00:45.024 --> 00:48.105

It's been sitting here all this time.</i>

<i>HEWES: So, when are you going

04:42.861 --> 04:46.438
<i>PARSONS: I can't.
He went back to Afghanistan.</i>

04:46.774 --> 04:47.830
<i>(laughing)</i>

04:48.066 --> 04:51.026
<i>HEWES: What? I thought you told
me he was your only witness.</i>

04:51.186 --> 04:52.089
<i>PARSONS: He is.</i>

04:52.174 --> 04:54.946
<i>I think the company
pressured him to redeploy.</i>

04:56.318 --> 04:59.132
<i>HEWES: Your entire case
hinges on his testimony.</i>

05:00.550 --> 05:01.927
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

05:04.090 --> 05:05.474
<i>PARSONS: I figure I have
one of two choices.</i>

05:05.566 --> 05:08.837
<i>I could either sit around and
wait for Chris to come back, or</i>

05:08.924 --> 05:11.115
<i>I could take my chances
and file my case.</i>

05:11.524 --> 05:13.511
<i>And hopefully, something
will come up in discovery.</i>

05:13.593 --> 05:16.044
<i>HEWES: If the judge lets
you get to discovery.</i>

05:16.941 --> 05:19.615
You'll be lucky if he doesn't
dismiss the case outright.

05:19.747 --> 05:24.214
PARSONS: What would you do?
I'm asking your advice.

05:28.027 --> 05:31.962
I know, I know. It's my case.
I just thought I'd ask.

05:32.902 --> 05:34.348
HEWES: You know what I'd do.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.681
PARSONS: You'd file the case.

05:38.023 --> 05:40.194
HEWES: If in doubt,
throw the first punch.

Lowry! Common motherfucker!

06:01.535 --> 06:03.460

06:11.935 --> 06:13.068
(helicopter whirrs in distance)

06:13.607 --> 06:14.538
(panting)

06:14.790 --> 06:16.332
SANCHEZ: Yeah.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.134
That shrink gave them to me.

06:30.915 --> 06:32.487
CARTER: Anything you
want to talk about?

06:34.352 --> 06:36.513
SANCHEZ: Before we left
on the last mission...

06:40.012 --> 06:41.508
Lowry came to me.

06:44.469 --> 06:49.644
He wanted to beg off.
Said it didn't feel right.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.857
It was too last minute,
we weren't prepared.

06:57.008 --> 06:58.939
I told him everything
would be all right.

07:01.016 --> 07:03.640
CARTER: What happened with
those guys, Sancho-- It...

07:05.380 --> 07:07.615
It wasn't your fault just
'cause you didn't die with 'em.

07:12.021 --> 07:16.050
ERICKSON: There are people in this world
who see things differently than we do.

07:16.194 --> 07:20.741
They mean well. They really do.
But they have different beliefs.

07:21.354 --> 07:24.180
We can't change them.
We shouldn't try to.

07:24.291 --> 07:28.432
But they can't
change us, either.

07:29.180 --> 07:32.094
It's important to take
pride in our beliefs.

07:32.293 --> 07:36.088
They are what sustain
us and give us purpose.

07:37.179 --> 07:38.759
Never forget that.

07:52.286 --> 07:55.025
Murder for money!

Murder for money...

07:59.468 --> 08:01.331
(cell phone ringing)

08:02.120 --> 08:03.489
Murder for money!
Murder for money!

08:05.292 --> 08:06.797
ERICKSON: Hear that, Jack?

08:07.036 --> 08:09.082
PROTESTORS: Murder for money!
Murder for money!

08:09.322 --> 08:13.000
ERICKSON: Think maybe you could find a
way to get these people off my street?

08:13.098 --> 08:15.848
SHAW: Well, I would, but there's a
little thing called the First Amendment.

08:15.945 --> 08:18.686
ERICKSON: What's going on?
I'm taking the boys to choir practice.

08:18.769 --> 08:22.337
SHAW: A wrongful death suit was filed
against you and High Star in federal court.

08:22.461 --> 08:23.516
ERICKSON: What's it say?

08:23.631 --> 08:27.013
SHAW: Three High Star
employees-- Jay Rayburn, Robert Franks

08:27.090 --> 08:31.670
and Thomas Lowry-- Were killed during
an unauthorized operation in Afghanistan.

08:33.708 --> 08:34.933
What do you know about it?

08:35.085 --> 08:36.806
ERICKSON: Meet me at
the house in two hours.

08:37.073 --> 08:40.110
PROTESTORS: Murder for money!
Murder for money!

08:40.924 --> 08:41.592
(door being kicked in)

08:48.395 --> 08:49.539
CARTER: Put some
plastic on these guys.

08:49.620 --> 08:50.618
SANCHEZ: All clear!

08:52.797 --> 08:56.012
Wait a minute. It's not him.

08:59.853 --> 09:01.222
SANCHEZ: Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

09:03.448 --> 09:04.233
He's not here.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.196
Hey! Boss asked you a question!

09:11.145 --> 09:11.731
SANCHEZ: What?

09:14.109 --> 09:15.280
I'm not catching all that.
What'd he say?

09:15.627 --> 09:18.423
CARTER: He's saying that they're afraid
of Nur Taraki. They hate the guy.

09:21.860 --> 09:22.822
Okay, let's bring them all in.

09:22.977 --> 09:23.697
SANCHEZ: A.C., no, no, no.

09:23.798 --> 09:25.543
Come on, man, look at these
guys-- They don't know shit.

09:25.660 --> 09:28.016
The intel was wrong. Let 'em go.

09:28.115 --> 09:29.540
Take off the fuckin' restraints.

09:30.408 --> 09:32.330
SHAW: The plaintiff's
attorney is Ellen Parsons.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.846
ERICKSON: Tell me about her.

09:34.022 --> 09:36.300
SHAW: Well, she was a hotshot
coming out of law school.

09:36.392 --> 09:38.648
Her first job was working
for Patty Hewes.

09:38.801 --> 09:40.733
ERICKSON: Patty who?
SHAW: Hewes.

09:41.019 --> 09:42.687
She took down Arthur Frobisher,

09:42.805 --> 09:44.552
handled that mess
with Louis Tobin.

09:44.645 --> 09:45.754
ERICKSON: Oh, yeah.

09:45.914 --> 09:48.555
SHAW: Ms. Parsons cut her teeth
on the Frobisher case, and

09:48.634 --> 09:51.092
then she left Hewes &
Associates, went to work in the

09:51.180 --> 09:53.624
D.A.'s office, but she
didn't stay there.

09:53.782 --> 09:55.248
Looks like she went
out on her own.

09:55.409 --> 09:56.698
ERICKSON: Should I
worry about her?

09:56.891 --> 09:58.641
SHAW: No. She's just a kid.

09:58.860 --> 10:01.456
A bleeding heart trying to
make a name for herself.

10:01.624 --> 10:03.176
But she doesn't have
much of a case.

10:03.342 --> 10:07.512
The brief lists a single
witness-- Christopher Sanchez.

10:08.260 --> 10:09.298
(protestors chanting outside)

10:09.400 --> 10:10.339
Do you know him?

10:11.557 --> 10:12.929
ERICKSON: Yeah.

10:14.453 --> 10:16.162
SHAW: Is he a problem?
ERICKSON: No.

10:17.377 --> 10:20.174
And he's working for me
right now in Afghanistan.

10:20.933 --> 10:24.886
SHAW: Then don't give this thing
another thought. I'll get it dismissed.

10:25.611 --> 10:26.963
ERICKSON: I'm
counting on you, Jack.

10:28.609 --> 10:29.885
HEWES: What have you found?

10:30.327 --> 10:33.952
HUNTLEY: I spoke to, um...
Tanya Greenblatt.

10:34.082 --> 10:35.246
HEWES: I have no
idea who that is.

10:35.358 --> 10:38.148
HUNTLEY: She worked with Michael
at Jill Burnham's art gallery.

10:40.454 --> 10:42.424
HEWES: And what did
Tanya have to say?

10:43.193 --> 10:46.752
HUNTLEY: Well, she, uh, lent Michael
her car just before he disappeared.

10:48.097 --> 10:52.657
And I-I think she may be the last person
who saw him before he left the city.

10:53.331 --> 10:55.542
But she hasn't heard
from him since.

10:55.798 --> 10:57.379
HEWES: Did she know
where he was going?

10:58.754 --> 11:00.472
HUNTLEY: No. No.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.424
But I'm fairly certain
he went to Boston.

11:03.923 --> 11:05.022
HEWES: Why do you say that?

11:05.124 --> 11:07.565
HUNTLEY: Well, I went through
that list of, uh, Michael's

11:07.651 --> 11:10.588
friends you gave me, and most
of them are away at school and

11:10.735 --> 11:14.562
didn't really keep up with him,
so I tried the social networks.

11:14.981 --> 11:16.599
You're not online.

11:16.762 --> 11:20.253
I tried to "friend" you, but you don't...
you don't have a page.

11:20.610 --> 11:22.000
HEWES: No, I don't.

11:22.423 --> 11:24.154
HUNTLEY: You know, it's just
extraordinary, the whole

11:24.251 --> 11:25.560
paradigm shift in the
way people relate.

11:25.753 --> 11:29.661
I just... I really think you should...
should try it.

11:32.085 --> 11:33.917
HEWES: Did you find anything?

11:34.876 --> 11:37.533
HUNTLEY: Um, yeah. The...

11:38.043 --> 11:40.176
Have you ever met a Henry Thain?

11:40.614 --> 11:44.561
HEWES: Yeah, he and Michael were
best friends since they were 11.

11:44.842 --> 11:48.213
HUNTLEY: Well, a couple years
back, one of Henry's old

11:48.347 --> 11:51.362
Facebook postings read,

11:52.950 --> 11:57.748
"M.H. appeared out of nowhere.
Needed a place to stay."

11:59.032 --> 12:01.274
And that was right around
the time that Michael, uh,

12:01.385 --> 12:06.481
disappeared, and...
Henry was a freshman at B.U. at the time.

12:06.878 --> 12:10.203
HEWES: So, do you think there's a
chance that Michael is still in Boston?

12:10.443 --> 12:12.928
HUNTLEY: Well, I-I poked Henry
to find out, but he never

12:13.026 --> 12:16.907
responded, so I'd like to go to
Boston and talk to him face-to-face.

12:17.708 --> 12:18.989
HEWES: I'd like to go with you.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.658
HUNTLEY: Well, that's
not really necessary.

12:21.817 --> 12:23.700
HEWES: It's my son
we're talking about.

12:25.134 --> 12:26.847
(Catherine caughing
over baby monitor)

12:29.860 --> 12:31.780
Anyway, Catherine's sick.
She has a fever.

12:32.097 --> 12:33.786
HUNTLEY: They catch everything
at that age, don't they?

12:33.929 --> 12:37.866
HEWES: And besides, I don't
have a nanny and I... don't have

12:37.955 --> 12:42.468
anyone I trust that I can...
leave her with.

12:45.944 --> 12:46.915
HENRY: Dude, you're rich.

12:47.009 --> 12:48.872
Use your credit card,
get a hotel room.

12:48.963 --> 12:50.700
MICHAEL: I can't.
They can trace it.

12:50.785 --> 12:52.090
I don't want anybody to find me.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.135
HENRY: What, are you
some kind of fucking spy?

12:54.222 --> 12:55.519
What the fuck are
you running from?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.558
MICHAEL: No one.
Just... forget it!

12:57.712 --> 13:00.225
HENRY: Even if my roommates agree,
the R.A.'s this gay dude

13:00.299 --> 13:01.810
who's like the fucking Gestapo.

13:01.896 --> 13:03.737
I'm on a shit list for
partying in my room.

13:03.847 --> 13:04.713
MICHAEL: Fuck it.

13:06.777 --> 13:07.918
HENRY: What?

13:08.019 --> 13:09.250
What are you gonna do?

13:09.424 --> 13:10.389
MICHAEL: Do you really care?

13:10.555 --> 13:11.748
HENRY: Go back to New York.

13:18.139 --> 13:19.154
(horn honks)

13:20.670 --> 13:22.360
(traffic passing by)

13:24.803 --> 13:26.746
(vehicle approaching)

13:34.540 --> 13:36.292
CARTER: You wanted to see
that intel on Nur Taraki?

13:40.100 --> 13:41.063
(Sanchez sighs)

13:47.705 --> 13:48.758
SANCHEZ: Who compiled this?

13:48.919 --> 13:50.027
CARTER: Boorman sent it.

13:53.855 --> 13:55.366
SANCHEZ: There's a hundred
different sources here.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.087
You know how long it would
take to check all these?

13:57.188 --> 13:58.373
CARTER: It's a fluid situation.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.511
I doubt the Mullah's in one
place for more than a day.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.302
SANCHEZ: I don't trust Boorman
with any of this shit.

14:07.109 --> 14:08.134
CARTER: Why would he lie?

14:08.731 --> 14:10.312
SANCHEZ: I got my own
contact on the ground.

14:10.481 --> 14:11.325
CARTER: Who?

14:11.490 --> 14:12.414
SANCHEZ: You don't know him.

14:12.497 --> 14:13.822
Someone I used to go
to for my own intel.

14:14.151 --> 14:15.220
CARTER: Good. Let's go.

14:16.205 --> 14:18.655
SANCHEZ: This is a
personal relationship, A.C.

14:19.962 --> 14:21.555
I need to go alone.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.120
SHAW: Your Honor, Ms.
Parsons' entire case is based on

14:25.263 --> 14:28.542
a single witness, Christopher
Sanchez, who will

14:28.656 --> 14:31.464
supposedly testify
to an alleged event.

14:31.581 --> 14:33.789
There is no other evidence
supporting the plaintiffs' claim.

14:35.139 --> 14:37.095
PARSONS: When Mr.
Sanchez came forward as a witness,

14:37.182 --> 14:39.841
he claimed that High Star was
involved in illegal activity

14:39.932 --> 14:42.396
that directly led to the
deaths of three men.

14:42.589 --> 14:44.331
SHAW: Then why did he go
back to work for the company?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.430
PAWLOWSKI: Thank you, Mr. Shaw.
I'll ask the questions.

14:46.738 --> 14:49.743
SHAW: Your Honor, Mr.
Sanchez recently redeployed to Afghanistan.

14:49.893 --> 14:52.169
PARSONS: It's my belief that he
was coerced into redeploying.

14:52.279 --> 14:53.662
PAWLOWSKI: And that
belief is based on what?

14:53.772 --> 14:56.626
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez has been suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder.

14:56.747 --> 14:59.540
He was prescribed medication
by his doctor who was later

14:59.667 --> 15:01.324
killed under suspicious
circumstances.

15:01.420 --> 15:02.971
SHAW: "Suspicious"?
What are you implying?

15:03.077 --> 15:05.446
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez believes
that High Star may have been

15:05.531 --> 15:07.241
responsible for his
doctor's death.

15:07.346 --> 15:09.961
SHAW: Keep it up, and I'll have a
slander suit filed against you by lunch.

15:10.088 --> 15:11.635
PARSONS: Given the
circumstances, it simply defies

15:11.746 --> 15:14.474
logic that Mr. Sanchez would
redeploy on his own volition.

15:14.562 --> 15:16.454
SHAW: I have his contract right
here, with his signature.

15:16.575 --> 15:18.603
PARSONS: All I'm asking, Your
Honor, is that you not dismiss

15:18.713 --> 15:22.122
this case until my witness has had the
opportunity to go on the record.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.892
PAWLOWSKI: How would you suggest
that we do that? He's in Afghanistan.

15:25.035 --> 15:26.376
PARSONS: He's working
for High Star.

15:26.492 --> 15:27.855
They must have access to him.

15:27.965 --> 15:30.155
SHAW: No, we don't. Mr.
Sanchez is out in the field

15:30.249 --> 15:32.601
on a six-month contract.
His assignment requires

15:32.697 --> 15:36.327
clandestine movement all over the country,
sometimes at a moment's notice.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.132
PAWLOWSKI: Ms. Parsons, you're
going to have to wait.

15:40.322 --> 15:42.622
Six months won't kill your case.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.517
PARSONS: But it could
kill my witness.

15:44.878 --> 15:48.245
He is in a war zone.
He could die at any time.

15:48.370 --> 15:50.417
For all I know, the company's
already had him killed.

15:50.508 --> 15:51.860
SHAW: Your Honor,
this is outrageous.

15:51.989 --> 15:53.385
PAWLOWSKI: Be careful, Ms.
Parsons.

15:53.501 --> 15:54.849
PARSONS: Can you prove
that he's alive?

15:54.937 --> 15:55.849
SHAW: Of course we can.

15:55.977 --> 15:57.372
PARSONS: Well, then you
must know where he is.

15:57.474 --> 15:58.746
Why can't the company
produce him?

16:02.135 --> 16:03.446
PAWLOWSKI: It's a good point, Mr.
Shaw.

16:05.282 --> 16:05.913
SHAW: Your Honor...

16:06.034 --> 16:07.467
PAWLOWSKI: Are you able
to produce him or not?

16:09.955 --> 16:11.161
SHAW: If necessary.

16:13.155 --> 16:15.165
PAWLOWSKI: I want to hear what Mr.
Sanchez has to say.

16:15.620 --> 16:18.366
I'll give you 48 hours to
produce him via video-link.

16:18.702 --> 16:20.547
SHAW: 48 hours?
I don't know that that's possible.

16:20.705 --> 16:22.401
PAWLOWSKI: I think
you can find a way.

16:24.126 --> 16:25.630
PARSONS: Thank you, Your Honor.

16:41.848 --> 16:44.649
ERICKSON: The judge is ordering
me to produce Sanchez in court.

16:44.807 --> 16:46.949
BOORMAN: Sounds like your
attorney's doing a bang-up

16:47.044 --> 16:48.717
job getting this
thing dismissed.

16:48.888 --> 16:52.565
Ellen Parsons is back working
out of Patty Hewes' firm.

16:52.713 --> 16:54.371
ERICKSON: How do you know?

16:54.682 --> 16:56.575
BOORMAN: I got her
cell phone tapped.

16:57.574 --> 16:59.575
ERICKSON: Ellen Parsons
filed the case alone.

16:59.808 --> 17:02.384
BOORMAN: Patty Hewes has got to
be putting her up as a front.

17:03.831 --> 17:06.048
ERICKSON: I don't
like this lawsuit.

17:07.976 --> 17:10.942
I think it may be time for
me to get my check book out.

17:11.042 --> 17:12.833
BOORMAN: You're already
paying Sanchez.

17:12.915 --> 17:14.526
ERICKSON: I'm not
talking Sanchez.

17:14.873 --> 17:16.866
I want to offer the
families a settlement.

17:17.219 --> 17:19.056
BOORMAN: Good idea, Howard.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.968
ERICKSON: I never liked
that last mission.

17:21.143 --> 17:23.518
The risk factor was
off the chart.

17:24.048 --> 17:26.797
BOORMAN: We had a small window
of opportunity. We had to go in.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.384
ERICKSON: The asset we
pulled out, was he worth it?

17:30.540 --> 17:34.650
BOORMAN: Absolutely.
We're getting quality intel out of him.

17:34.777 --> 17:36.027
ERICKSON: You still
have the guy?

17:37.807 --> 17:39.569
BOORMAN: He's
under our control.

17:40.831 --> 17:43.220
(classical music playing)

18:04.432 --> 18:05.975
BOORMAN: I got you
an egg sandwich.

18:06.102 --> 18:07.386
I think, uh...

18:08.433 --> 18:09.706
I think you're gonna like it.

18:12.509 --> 18:15.982
And you've been very cooperative,
so I threw in some dessert.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.093
(door squeaking)

18:18.685 --> 18:22.812
PARSONS: Howard Erickson called.
He wants to meet with me.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.632
HEWES: Interesting.
PARSONS: Without his attorney.

18:27.461 --> 18:30.269
HEWES: That's unethical.
PARSONS: Highly unethical.

18:31.456 --> 18:34.658
HEWES: If the judge finds out,
you'll get thrown off the case.

18:34.898 --> 18:36.628
You and Erickson
can't meet alone.

18:37.536 --> 18:40.525
PARSONS: That's why I
want you to go for me.

18:42.828 --> 18:44.790
HEWES: Me?
PARSONS: You'd enjoy that, right?

18:44.906 --> 18:48.880
Sitting across from Howard Erickson.
Finding out what he's up to.

18:53.735 --> 18:57.315
PARSONS: Come on, Patty.
It'd be fun for you.

18:58.890 --> 19:01.044
And I would love to
get your take on him.

19:02.822 --> 19:04.655
HEWES: I'm sure you would.

19:14.252 --> 19:16.055
PARSONS: So, you're not
gonna do this for me?

19:17.538 --> 19:22.165
HEWES: No reason to.
PARSONS: I can think of one.

19:26.615 --> 19:28.234
ZAFAR MARWAT: Eat
some more, Chris.

19:28.935 --> 19:32.774
SANCHEZ: No. Really, I'm stuffed.
It was delicious.

19:34.695 --> 19:35.892
(speaking Pashto)

19:37.153 --> 19:38.290
ZAFAR: Good Pashto.

19:38.717 --> 19:40.409
(repeats what Sanchez just said)

19:42.960 --> 19:45.868
We are very happy to have
you here, very happy.

19:46.807 --> 19:48.154
SANCHEZ: How are
things in the province?

19:50.319 --> 19:51.632
ZAFAR: Not very good.

19:52.321 --> 19:56.956
There is no safety,
little food, less hope.

19:58.456 --> 20:03.129
My only wish-- For my
grandchildren to know peace in

20:03.246 --> 20:07.603
their lifetime, but my son-- He
believes this is not possible.

20:07.772 --> 20:09.666
SANCHEZ: Where is Nasim?
I was hoping to see him.

20:10.585 --> 20:14.195
ZAFAR: My son is out
driving his taxi.

20:15.726 --> 20:16.899
SANCHEZ: Oh.
I'm sorry I missed him.

20:17.979 --> 20:20.212
I really need to ask
him some questions.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.493
ZAFAR: Perhaps I can help.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.161
ERICKSON: There's nothing
to be ashamed of, Jake.

20:29.024 --> 20:30.731
JAKE: I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.241
ERICKSON: The sheets.

20:33.451 --> 20:36.166
I want you to know
it's perfectly normal.

20:38.049 --> 20:39.855
You're 13 now.

20:40.830 --> 20:43.457
I think it's time you and I
had a talk about manhood.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.621
JAKE: Can I get the waffles?

20:46.251 --> 20:47.857
HEWES: Waffles sound delicious.

20:50.789 --> 20:52.546
HEWES: You don't know who I am?

20:53.323 --> 20:56.036
ERICKSON: Oh, shoot.
I'm so sorry.

20:56.149 --> 20:58.644
I feel like a certified ass.
Patty Hewes.

20:58.797 --> 20:59.825
HEWES: Hello.

21:00.210 --> 21:02.091
ERICKSON: Jake, I'd like a
word alone with Ms. Hewes.

21:02.176 --> 21:06.828
Could you give us a minute, son?
You got your Game Boy?

21:07.310 --> 21:09.616
JAKE: Sure.
HEWES: Thank you, Jake.

21:13.456 --> 21:16.818
I have a son.
ERICKSON: I have four.

21:17.535 --> 21:18.510
(both laugh)

21:19.490 --> 21:22.391
ERICKSON: I heard a rumor Ms.
Parsons wasn't trying this case alone.

21:22.603 --> 21:27.268
HEWES: Actually, she is.
She has no idea I'm here.

21:27.447 --> 21:29.332
ERICKSON: Then
why are you here?

21:30.174 --> 21:31.602
HEWES: I have my reasons.

21:33.838 --> 21:37.179
ERICKSON: Ms.
Parsons never got back to me.

21:38.778 --> 21:41.960
I was hoping I could find
a way forward with her.

21:42.999 --> 21:44.317
HEWES: A way forward?

21:44.656 --> 21:46.813
ERICKSON: Maybe you can
carry a message for me.

21:48.671 --> 21:51.022
I'm willing to make an offer.

21:59.761 --> 22:01.325
HEWES: That's a lot of money.

22:01.552 --> 22:03.896
ERICKSON: I just want to do
what's right for those families.

22:04.249 --> 22:05.723
HEWES: Ms.
Parsons won't let you.

22:07.999 --> 22:10.249
She's not interested
in a settlement.

22:10.754 --> 22:13.037
She's desperate to make
a name for herself.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.014
But she's in over her head.

22:17.565 --> 22:21.181
If I were you...
I'd keep my money.

22:21.343 --> 22:24.070
She'll never beat you in court.
She doesn't have a case.

22:24.347 --> 22:28.868
ERICKSON: What is this, some
kind of negotiating ploy, or are

22:28.970 --> 22:33.188
you angling to push Ms. Parsons out so
you can take over this case yourself?

22:34.281 --> 22:36.525
HEWES: I have my own
cases to worry about.

22:36.657 --> 22:38.665
ERICKSON: Look, I'm not
interested in playing games.

22:43.794 --> 22:45.468
This is my final offer.

22:45.574 --> 22:49.105
HEWES: This isn't my case.
I'm in no position to make a deal.

22:49.205 --> 22:51.251
ERICKSON: Then do me a
solid and pass that along.

22:53.631 --> 23:00.069
The offer is generous. Tell Ms.
Parsons there won't be another.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.949
PARSONS: How did it go?
HEWES: It was smart to file the case.

23:07.059 --> 23:08.392
He wants to settle.

23:08.482 --> 23:12.529
He even was willing to negotiate
against himself and up the offer.

23:12.610 --> 23:13.774
PARSONS: But you
didn't accept it.

23:13.883 --> 23:16.445
HEWES: No, but you need to
take the offer to your clients.

23:17.359 --> 23:18.678
PARSONS: They don't
need to know.

23:18.820 --> 23:20.959
HEWES: That's not
exactly ethical, Ellen.

23:21.052 --> 23:22.481
It's a substantial figure.

23:22.620 --> 23:23.950
PARSONS: I'll think about it.

23:24.410 --> 23:26.335
HEWES: Well, anyway, you know that
Erickson's scared now,

23:26.411 --> 23:27.543
so just keep pusing.

23:27.737 --> 23:28.963
PARSONS: Thanks for
going to meet with him.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.180
I'm glad we could
help each other out.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.771
HEWES: How's my little girl?

23:35.296 --> 23:36.831
PARSONS: She's fine.
Don't worry.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.366
HEWES: Well, check her
temperature every couple of

23:38.428 --> 23:40.893
hours, and if anything goes
wrong, anything at all, her

23:40.969 --> 23:43.794
doctor's number's on
the fridge, okay?

23:43.873 --> 23:45.673
And make sure she
stays hydrated.

23:45.793 --> 23:47.541
PARSONS: I'll take good care
of her while you're away.

23:48.769 --> 23:50.271
Listen, I forgot to ask.

23:50.353 --> 23:52.407
I'm looking after Chris's
dog while he's away.

23:52.483 --> 23:54.004
Is it okay if I bring her over?

23:54.161 --> 23:55.479
HEWES: Yeah, it's no problem.

23:55.566 --> 23:57.251
PARSONS: Okay. Thanks, Patty.

23:57.412 --> 23:58.116
HEWES: Bye.

24:00.903 --> 24:02.063
You drive.

24:03.739 --> 24:04.970
You do drive?

24:07.125 --> 24:08.351
ZAFAR: I know who he is.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.866
Mullah Nur Taraki.

24:11.248 --> 24:14.853
Well-known in this province.
Very powerful.

24:15.307 --> 24:16.969
SANCHEZ: I was told my men
killed his brother, and now

24:17.052 --> 24:18.201
he's seeking revenge.

24:19.210 --> 24:20.828
ZAFAR: Who told you this?

24:21.916 --> 24:23.804
SANCHEZ: It's better
for you not to know.

24:24.551 --> 24:28.675
ZAFAR: Taraki's brother was
killed, but not by your men.

24:30.150 --> 24:33.124
He was beheaded
by a rival tribe.

24:34.153 --> 24:35.414
Taraki knows this.

24:39.705 --> 24:40.969
SANCHEZ: Are you sure?

24:47.192 --> 24:48.582
ZAFAR: Listen to me, Chris.

24:49.157 --> 24:50.475
I am your friend.

24:51.235 --> 24:55.662
This story that you have
been told-- It's fiction.

24:56.752 --> 24:58.482
SANCHEZ: I thought it might be.

25:04.454 --> 25:06.887
But that's not the only
reason I came to see you.

25:09.345 --> 25:10.414
ZAFAR: No?

25:10.740 --> 25:12.819
SANCHEZ: I need to tell you
about the missions I led.

25:13.850 --> 25:17.481
Your son, Nasim, helped me with
information, what... whatever I

25:17.559 --> 25:18.740
needed to do my job.

25:18.832 --> 25:20.187
I will always be grateful.

25:21.823 --> 25:23.204
But what I did...

25:24.733 --> 25:26.612
We interrogated people.

25:28.336 --> 25:30.926
I think many of
them were innocent.

25:33.638 --> 25:35.160
Some of them died.

25:40.019 --> 25:40.973
I...

25:42.919 --> 25:45.959
I didn't think of it as
torture at the time.

25:46.080 --> 25:48.364
We-we were doing it for
the right reasons.

25:48.450 --> 25:49.631
We were.

25:52.662 --> 25:56.223
But... I think we did
more harm than good.

25:58.232 --> 25:59.578
I regret it now.

26:01.621 --> 26:04.686
You came all the way to
Afghanistan to tell us this?

26:08.017 --> 26:09.326
SANCHEZ: I'm very sorry.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.215
(sighs)

26:18.938 --> 26:20.650
BOORMAN: I'm coming
up to get you.

26:24.410 --> 26:25.713
Time to pray.

26:28.403 --> 26:30.118
HUNTLEY: So you wouldn't
let Michael stay with you?

26:32.152 --> 26:34.018
HENRY: Look, I'm gonna
be late for class.

26:34.849 --> 26:37.145
HUNTLEY: You're not going to turn
your back on him again, are you?

26:37.436 --> 26:39.999
HENRY: What was I supposed to
do, let him live in my dorm?

26:40.142 --> 26:41.388
I had roommates.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.083
HEWES: All right, Maggie.
That's fine.

26:43.643 --> 26:44.907
HENRY: Who is that?

26:45.285 --> 26:48.159
HEWES: And tell Girotto I need to
push back the deposition again.

26:48.264 --> 26:49.222
I'm out of town.

26:49.338 --> 26:50.402
HENRY: Oh, fuck.

26:52.294 --> 26:53.977
HEWES: Hello, Henry.
How are you?

26:54.083 --> 26:55.230
HENRY: I'm fine, Ms. Hewes.

26:55.322 --> 26:58.231
HEWES: So, you're a junior now.

27:00.026 --> 27:01.658
Your parents must be proud.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.822
HENRY: I'm so sorry about
Michael, Ms. Hewes.

27:03.935 --> 27:06.348
When he showed up,
we were in finals.

27:06.475 --> 27:07.901
I was totally swamped.

27:07.979 --> 27:09.432
I really wanted to
help him, but...

27:09.526 --> 27:10.808
HEWES: Relax, Henry.

27:10.875 --> 27:12.640
This isn't about you.
You are not in trouble.

27:12.719 --> 27:14.341
I'm just trying to find Michael.

27:14.425 --> 27:15.650
HUNTLEY: Any idea
where he is now?

27:15.789 --> 27:17.667
HENRY: Last time I saw
him was a while ago.

27:17.806 --> 27:19.569
HUNTLEY: And where
exactly was that?

27:20.604 --> 27:23.661
HENRY: He used to hang
out across the street

27:23.749 --> 27:25.921
from this nightclub
called Razor Fish.

27:26.065 --> 27:28.519
HEWES: Hang out? And do what?

27:29.689 --> 27:32.767
HENRY: Seemed like he was trying to
work his way into the scene down there.

27:33.823 --> 27:35.302
HEWES: Where did he live?

27:36.280 --> 27:37.606
HENRY: In his car.

27:40.129 --> 27:41.987
HEWES: So he was homeless?

27:44.144 --> 27:45.388
HENRY: I brought him clothes.

27:46.022 --> 27:47.422
Even gave him money once.

27:49.172 --> 27:51.185
I'm so sorry, Ms. Hewes.

27:57.138 --> 27:59.588
BOORMAN: Patty Hewes came
instead of Ellen Parsons?

28:00.568 --> 28:03.156
ERICKSON: I don't know what kind
of tag-team they got going on.

28:04.801 --> 28:10.761
I offered 'em a shit pot full of money,
but they have no intention of settling.

28:13.363 --> 28:15.126
No. I'm not hungry.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.097
I'm worried about Chris Sanchez.

28:24.641 --> 28:26.258
Who knows what he's
gonna say in court?

28:28.681 --> 28:31.103
BOORMAN: Hmm. He doesn't have to
say anything if he doesn't appear.

28:36.740 --> 28:38.376
Afghanistan's a
war zone, Howard.

28:40.709 --> 28:42.600
Anything can happen.

28:46.968 --> 28:48.828
(crickets chirping)

28:51.705 --> 28:52.990
CARTER: What did
your contact say?

28:53.083 --> 28:54.228
SANCHEZ: Boorman's
full of shit.

28:54.597 --> 28:56.093
We didn't kill Taraki's brother.

28:56.620 --> 29:00.583
The fucking fatwa against
me-- All bullshit.

29:07.776 --> 29:09.347
What are you doing, A.C.?

29:10.280 --> 29:14.404
CARTER: Sorry, man.
Lawsuit's been filed.

29:14.927 --> 29:16.265
There's going to be a hearing.

29:17.774 --> 29:19.442
The company cannot
have you talking.

29:23.412 --> 29:25.719
JUDGE PAWLOWSKI: Mr. Shaw,
we have been here for over an hour.

29:25.853 --> 29:26.713
SHAW: I'm sorry, Your Honor.

29:26.805 --> 29:28.983
They assured me Mr.
Sanchez would be online by now.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.823
It may be a technical problem.

29:31.033 --> 29:32.341
Perhaps we could reschedule?

29:32.428 --> 29:33.747
PARSONS: They're just
stalling, Your Honor.

29:33.824 --> 29:35.475
Either that, or my witness
is being threatened.

29:35.570 --> 29:37.558
SANCHEZ: Can you hear me? Ellen?

29:38.947 --> 29:40.337
PAWLOWSKI: Welcome, Mr.
Sanchez.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.001
(crickets chirping)

29:43.044 --> 29:45.491
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez, on the
day Rayburn, Franks and Lowry

29:45.569 --> 29:48.132
were killed, you were on a
mission for High Star Security,

29:48.207 --> 29:49.195
is that correct?

29:49.304 --> 29:50.191
SANCHEZ: Yes.

29:50.476 --> 29:52.680
PARSONS: And what was the
purpose of this operation?

29:52.818 --> 29:55.070
SANCHEZ: Our orders were to
escort kitchen equipment to a

29:55.147 --> 29:56.978
NATO base outside Kandahar.

29:59.134 --> 30:00.368
PARSONS: Kitchen equipment?

30:00.539 --> 30:01.653
SANCHEZ: That's correct.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.136
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez, in
previous conversations, do you

30:05.219 --> 30:09.014
recall stating that you were
involved in an illegal operation?

30:10.770 --> 30:11.737
SANCHEZ: No.

30:14.181 --> 30:16.074
I don't ever recall saying that.

30:20.232 --> 30:22.079
We were escorting
kitchen supplies.

30:23.706 --> 30:25.350
PARSONS: Then how
did these men die?

30:26.052 --> 30:28.411
SANCHEZ: We were ambushed as we
drove through the Kydar Pass.

30:28.511 --> 30:30.214
The enemy had position
on the ridge.

30:32.034 --> 30:34.956
PARSONS: Mr. Sanchez, is
your testimony being coerced?

30:35.093 --> 30:35.730
SHAW: Your Honor...

30:35.821 --> 30:36.939
PAWLOWSKI: He-he...
he can answer.

30:37.032 --> 30:39.604
Mr. Sanchez, are you
under any duress?

30:39.763 --> 30:41.707
SANCHEZ: No, sir, not at all.

30:42.890 --> 30:45.787
PARSONS: In previous
conversations, you told me that

30:45.865 --> 30:48.026
you never wanted to
return to Afghanistan.

30:48.783 --> 30:50.560
What has made you
change your mind?

30:51.680 --> 30:53.015
SANCHEZ: My mother's sick.

30:53.963 --> 30:56.662
I needed the money, so I
re-upped with High Star.

30:57.048 --> 31:01.038
PARSONS: You may be 7,000 miles away, Mr.
Sanchez, but you are still under oath.

31:01.721 --> 31:03.828
SANCHEZ: I understand.

31:05.838 --> 31:07.857
PARSONS: Do you know the
penalties for perjury?

31:09.558 --> 31:11.164
SANCHEZ: I'm telling the truth.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.138
PAWLOWSKI: Do you have
anything further, Ms. Parsons?

31:20.942 --> 31:22.246
PARSONS: No, Your Honor.

31:22.568 --> 31:26.575
SANCHEZ: Ellen? My dog is sick.

31:28.255 --> 31:30.188
PAWLOWSKI: What-what...?
What did he say?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.228
PARSONS: I'm, uh...
I'm looking after his dog, Your Honor.

31:33.333 --> 31:36.387
SANCHEZ: Can you take her to the vet?
Please, Ellen.

31:36.525 --> 31:38.856
It's right around the
corner from my apartment.

31:39.365 --> 31:40.689
SHAW: Your Honor,
this is absurd.

31:40.770 --> 31:42.791
PAWLOWSKI: Mr. Sanchez, we're
on the taxpayers' dime here.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.198
SANCHEZ: Talk to the vet.

31:44.677 --> 31:46.790
The dog-- She was abused
by her previous owner.

31:46.875 --> 31:49.056
PAWLOWSKI: Mr. Sanchez, this-this...
this situation is over.

31:49.133 --> 31:51.614
Thank you very much for your
cooperation. Be safe, sir.

31:51.717 --> 31:52.732
(static hissing)

31:54.367 --> 31:55.336
Wow.

31:56.592 --> 31:59.493
At this point, Ms. Parsons,

31:59.594 --> 32:02.119
I don't know exactly
what you want me to do.

32:03.551 --> 32:05.214
I don't see any
grounds for a case.

32:10.581 --> 32:12.053
(crickets chirping)

32:21.831 --> 32:23.222
CARTER: You did
the right thing.

32:26.531 --> 32:27.976
SANCHEZ: Let him go now.

32:38.572 --> 32:39.694
CARTER: Take him home.

32:56.164 --> 32:57.475
CARTER: Sorry.

33:04.913 --> 33:06.627
MICHAEL: Can you help me out?

33:07.306 --> 33:08.297
SETH: I doubt it.

33:08.625 --> 33:10.709
Wait, wait. See this...
This is interesting.

33:10.914 --> 33:12.578
This guy wants a handout.

33:12.721 --> 33:13.529
MICHAEL: Fuck off.

33:13.827 --> 33:14.530
SETH: What happened?

33:14.637 --> 33:16.694
You run away from home 'cause
daddy doesn't love you?

33:16.792 --> 33:19.536
Stop feeling sorry
for yourself, bitch.

33:20.473 --> 33:21.576
WOMAN: Come on, let's go.

33:27.168 --> 33:28.655
(crowd chatter)

33:29.613 --> 33:31.217
(club music playing)

33:48.817 --> 33:50.052
MICHAEL: How much
shit do you have?

33:50.548 --> 33:52.531
Enough. It's 40 a tab.

33:52.646 --> 33:54.935
You got the cash?
MICHAEL: No.

33:55.405 --> 33:56.810
Get the fuck out of here, man.

33:57.845 --> 33:59.056
MICHAEL: I'll take all you got.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.675
What, you gonna rob me now?

34:01.759 --> 34:04.399
MICHAEL: No. I'm gonna pay you
for everything you've got.

34:04.965 --> 34:06.775
And I want your suit.

34:08.025 --> 34:09.161
You're gonna pay me with what?

34:10.786 --> 34:12.049
MICHAEL: My car.

34:14.873 --> 34:16.373
What am I supposed
to do with that?

34:16.728 --> 34:18.458
MICHAEL: There's a chop
shop around the corner.

34:18.565 --> 34:20.612
You're a smart guy.
Figure it out.

34:22.821 --> 34:25.456
You want the car or not?

34:43.436 --> 34:45.333
PARSONS: Hi. Uh, I signed in.

34:45.737 --> 34:47.143
I'm Ellen Parsons.

34:48.730 --> 34:49.955
TARA: What's wrong with her?

34:51.199 --> 34:52.373
I'm not sure, actually.

34:52.478 --> 34:55.013
I was just told to bring her in.
She's not mine.

34:55.120 --> 34:57.236
TARA: Yeah, I know.
She belongs to Chris.

35:00.828 --> 35:03.646
So, uh, you're Ellen.

35:06.222 --> 35:09.532
I saw your name on his phone
when you called last week.

35:09.630 --> 35:12.341
PARSONS: Oh, right.
So you're friends with Chris?

35:13.223 --> 35:15.070
TARA: I-I thought so.

35:15.895 --> 35:18.597
But then he dropped off the
face of the Earth and...

35:23.370 --> 35:24.761
Is he with you now?

35:25.921 --> 35:26.904
PARSONS: No.

35:27.393 --> 35:29.814
We just knew each other from
high school, and he asked me

35:29.887 --> 35:32.761
to watch Ghwarri
while he was away.

35:34.017 --> 35:35.244
TARA: Away where?

35:38.489 --> 35:40.039
PARSONS: Afghanistan.

35:41.269 --> 35:42.576
TARA: He went back?

35:44.028 --> 35:46.616
PARSONS: Look, um, I know
this is gonna sound very

35:46.701 --> 35:50.515
strange, but I think that he may
have sent me here to talk to you.

35:53.388 --> 35:55.640
Chris insisted that
I bring her here.

35:56.502 --> 35:59.483
He said that her previous
owner abused her.

35:59.603 --> 36:00.804
Do you know anything about that?

36:01.574 --> 36:04.483
TARA: All I know is, Chris
rescued her from some

36:04.579 --> 36:06.962
asshole he was going
after over there.

36:07.421 --> 36:09.583
PARSONS: What do you
mean he was going after?

36:10.532 --> 36:14.094
CONWAY: Um, I don't know.
He didn't really explain.

36:15.688 --> 36:18.898
PARSONS: I'm just asking because he
wasn't supposed to be going after anyone.

36:18.999 --> 36:20.638
He was just there to
provide security.

36:20.751 --> 36:22.028
CONWAY: I'm sorry I can't help.

36:22.114 --> 36:23.063
I guess if Chris had wanted you

36:23.121 --> 36:25.108
to know something, he would
have told you himself.

36:30.762 --> 36:33.184
(techno-pop playing)

36:42.791 --> 36:45.643
MICHAEL: Hey, I heard
you're looking to buy.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.016
SETH: You heard wrong.

36:47.223 --> 36:49.699
MICHAEL: You look familiar.
Do I know you?

36:51.357 --> 36:54.107
SETH: I've never seen you
before, and I'm not interested.

36:54.771 --> 36:55.978
MICHAEL: My mistake.

37:09.233 --> 37:10.743
WOMAN: Come on, I want some.

37:11.094 --> 37:12.117
SETH: How much?

37:13.338 --> 37:14.429
MICHAEL: $80 a hit.

37:14.544 --> 37:15.872
SETH: I can get it for $40.

37:16.439 --> 37:17.525
MICHAEL: Not this shit.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.070
WOMAN: Don't be such
a cheap bastard.

37:24.788 --> 37:26.775
SETH: Fuck it. Give me 20 tabs.

37:27.514 --> 37:28.645
MICHAEL: You won't be sorry.

37:33.476 --> 37:34.941
WOMAN: You should
party with us.

38:03.099 --> 38:04.391
SETH: Where are you going?

38:10.402 --> 38:13.821
MICHAEL: This was fun,
but I got to go.

38:37.130 --> 38:38.432
BIG RAY: Hey, guys,
we're closed.

38:38.572 --> 38:40.527
And no, you can't
use the bathroom.

38:43.535 --> 38:44.937
HUNTLEY: Do I look
like I need to pee?

38:49.185 --> 38:50.487
Do you recognize him?

38:51.340 --> 38:53.426
BIG RAY: Holy shit. That dude?

38:54.650 --> 38:56.180
What the fuck ever
happened to him?

38:56.393 --> 38:57.789
HUNTLEY: That's what
we're trying to find out.

38:58.018 --> 38:59.716
BIG RAY: You a cop?
HUNTLEY: Sort of.

38:59.969 --> 39:01.266
So what can you
tell me about him?

39:02.148 --> 39:05.229
BIG RAY: He used to hang out across
the street. The kid was an asshole.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.239
HEWES: He's my son.

39:09.283 --> 39:10.966
BIG RAY: Oh, I'm sorry.

39:12.568 --> 39:15.014
I can see that now.
You look alike.

39:15.390 --> 39:16.729
HEWES: Why was he an asshole?

39:17.202 --> 39:18.882
BIG RAY: He started
slinging dope.

39:19.205 --> 39:22.810
HEWES: So...
He was selling drugs?

39:23.479 --> 39:24.544
BIG RAY: Yeah.

39:25.331 --> 39:27.230
HUNTLEY: Any of the people he
was running with still around?

39:27.480 --> 39:29.089
BIG RAY: The dude
didn't run with anyone.

39:29.202 --> 39:32.432
He was a loner.
Pissed off a lot of people.

39:33.119 --> 39:34.735
The wrong people.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.138
Then one day he disappeared.

39:52.620 --> 39:53.933
HEWES: Thank you for driving.

39:56.450 --> 39:58.987
HUNTLEY: I've seen this kind of
thing before, and I-- I think

39:59.103 --> 40:03.360
you should be prepared
for, uh, anything.

40:08.592 --> 40:10.406
HEWES: You-you think
Michael's dead?

40:10.532 --> 40:13.253
HUNTLEY: No, I'm just saying
that you should be prepared.

40:28.775 --> 40:29.889
PARSONS: Hi.

40:30.018 --> 40:30.886
HEWES: Hi.

40:33.419 --> 40:34.565
PARSONS: Welcome back.

40:35.731 --> 40:36.739
HEWES: Thanks.

40:38.908 --> 40:40.433
PARSONS: Catherine's
doing a lot better.

40:40.546 --> 40:42.479
Her fever broke and her
temperature's down.

40:42.830 --> 40:43.874
HEWES: Oh, good.

40:44.790 --> 40:45.716
PARSONS: We had a lovely time.

40:45.809 --> 40:47.335
Read all her favorite
books twice.

40:49.884 --> 40:51.259
She's very sweet.

40:51.842 --> 40:53.053
HEWES: Yes, she is.

40:55.943 --> 40:56.864
(sighs)

40:59.115 --> 41:00.491
PARSONS: Did you find Michael?

41:03.429 --> 41:04.643
HEWES: No.

41:08.104 --> 41:09.617
PARSONS: I'm sorry.

41:12.399 --> 41:13.863
HEWES: So how's
your case going?

41:14.776 --> 41:17.103
What does your witness
say at the hearing?

41:18.285 --> 41:21.912
PARSONS: Well, um,
they got him to lie.

41:24.267 --> 41:26.385
He was trying to
tell me something.

41:26.514 --> 41:29.347
I think they were going after
somebody over there, but I

41:29.436 --> 41:31.347
haven't figured out
what he meant yet.

41:37.123 --> 41:39.176
I've been lying to myself.

41:40.967 --> 41:42.591
I'm stuck.

41:44.442 --> 41:47.132
I can't win this case
without you, Patty.

41:50.613 --> 41:53.045
I want more than just
the firm's resources.

41:58.149 --> 42:03.246
HEWES: You want the benefit of
my experience and advice, so

42:03.359 --> 42:06.809
you can make a name for yourself
and go out on your own.

42:07.936 --> 42:09.781
PARSONS: Why
wouldn't I want that?

42:12.086 --> 42:14.634
HEWES: All you
needed to do was ask.

42:17.195 --> 42:18.167
SANCHEZ: What the
fuck are you doing?

42:18.324 --> 42:21.253
I told them what you wanted!
I told them what you fucking wanted!

42:21.350 --> 42:22.732
- What you fucking wanted!
- We can't let you go back to the U.S. man.

42:22.813 --> 42:24.577
This is about national
security, and you know it.

42:26.428 --> 42:27.901
Back the fuck up.

42:30.886 --> 42:32.692
SANCHEZ: A.C.
Don't do this to me!

42:32.869 --> 42:34.122
(door locking)

42:34.658 --> 42:35.370
(panting)

42:36.313 --> 42:38.315
Fuck! Fuck!

42:50.671 --> 42:52.186
(crickets chirping)

42:52.949 --> 42:54.140
(vehicle approaching)

43:06.708 --> 43:08.022
HIGH STAR CONTRACTOR:
You're free to go.

43:34.942 --> 43:35.937
(car door closes)

43:45.726 --> 43:46.703
(gunshot)

43:50.285 --> 43:51.382
(gunshot)

44:04.827 --> 44:06.211
(car door closes)

44:13.273 --> 44:15.379
(classical music playing)

44:31.719 --> 44:32.642
MAN (over radio):
Thank God for Patty...

44:32.731 --> 44:34.137
(loud thud, tires squealing)

44:41.023 --> 44:43.525
MICHAEL: Getting away from you is the best
thing that could have happened to me.

44:49.143 --> 44:51.780
People either leave
you or they die.

45:43.491 --> 45:45.315
(unzipping duffel bag)
