02:03.688 --> 02:05.104
Ah fuck!

02:41.665 --> 02:42.866
<i>Good morning Woodhaven.</i>

02:42.867 --> 02:45.562
<i>This is WCK, I'm Bob</i>

02:45.563 --> 02:49.657
<i>I'm Dan, and we are BAD Radio.
B-A-D Radio.</i>

02:49.658 --> 02:52.250
<i>The clock is tick-tick-ticking
down to you know what.</i>

02:52.251 --> 02:55.248
<i>The world famous
Drink n Shoot.</i>

02:55.249 --> 02:56.457
<i>Don't you judge me.</i>

02:56.458 --> 02:58.279
<i>Looks like some people
might have started early.</i>

02:58.280 --> 03:02.116
<i>We're still getting daily reports
about missing dogs and cats.</i>

03:02.617 --> 03:03.792
<i>I'm not pointing any fingers</i>

03:03.793 --> 03:06.631
<i>No, but I'd avoid eating the
hotdogs they're showing on me.</i>

03:06.632 --> 03:09.240
<i>And I'd avoid those
pork stores anyway.</i>

03:09.241 --> 03:10.353
<i>You know what I've heard Dan?</i>

03:10.354 --> 03:12.130
<i>People are certainly
scared to getting eaten </i>

03:12.131 --> 03:14.629
<i>by the infamous
Woodhaven walking bear.</i>

03:14.630 --> 03:16.631
<i>- Be a bear is on the attack.
- We were.</i>

03:16.632 --> 03:19.396
<i>Mayor Bradley is looking
like the election frontrunner.</i>

03:19.397 --> 03:22.358
<i>So will it be golden
boy Terry Wallace or</i>

03:22.359 --> 03:25.336
<i>returning heavyweight Mayor Bradley.</i>

03:25.337 --> 03:28.026
<i>Who has what it takes
to clean up this town.</i>

03:28.027 --> 03:32.228
<i>Not enough mayors in the world to
help our Woodhaven Sheriff Department.</i>

03:32.429 --> 03:35.569
<i>Speaking of which eclipse morning
radio is of course brought to you by</i>

03:35.570 --> 03:36.759
<i>Liquor Doughnuts.</i>

03:36.960 --> 03:41.775
<i>Liquor Doughnuts,
what more could you ask for?</i>

04:03.969 --> 04:05.303
Where is he?

04:06.021 --> 04:09.869
- I'm right here, genius.
- Chief, I was just about to...

04:09.870 --> 04:10.906
Save your bullshit, Lou.

04:10.907 --> 04:12.940
I could smell you the moment
you pulled into the station.

04:12.941 --> 04:14.115
Fuck!

04:14.829 --> 04:18.180
Tina should have been off
night watch, what, 2 hours ago?

04:19.096 --> 04:20.914
Get an update from her.

04:23.979 --> 04:28.004
- What's up his ass?
- They hit Munro's gas station last night.

04:28.005 --> 04:32.220
- Who?
- P.D's.

04:37.792 --> 04:39.356
Sergeant Tina Wash.

04:39.357 --> 04:42.752
<i>- Hey, this is Willie Higens.
- Willie.  You again.</i>

04:42.753 --> 04:44.859
Yeah ah.
Slow down.

04:47.342 --> 04:49.199
Okay.
I got it.

04:55.287 --> 04:59.947
Disturbance call.
Your boyfriend Willie Higens.

05:01.882 --> 05:03.946
You think you can get this one?

05:23.344 --> 05:24.651
Willie!

05:28.093 --> 05:30.380
- What is it this time?
- Shhhh.

05:34.655 --> 05:36.581
Won't you come around back?

05:40.731 --> 05:44.467
Officer.
Let me show you.

05:45.829 --> 05:49.973
- Please tell me this is Bigfoot sex tape.
- No.

05:51.313 --> 05:53.179
Do you believe in the occult, Lou?

05:53.510 --> 05:55.048
Because I think I know
what's been happening

05:55.049 --> 05:57.550
to all the missing
pets around town.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.752
Jesus Christ?

06:03.126 --> 06:06.291
Teenagers.
They've been sacrificing them to Satan.

06:06.292 --> 06:09.175
God knows why, I don't know.  I assume
they've doing some kinky sexual stuff.

06:09.176 --> 06:12.846
But they've been creeping around
in the bushes out back all week.

06:18.416 --> 06:20.490
<i>I'm here in the woods.</i>

06:20.491 --> 06:23.080
<i>I know this is dark,
I mean come along.</i>

06:23.281 --> 06:26.558
<i>- Look! Here!
- There's the mark of the beast.</i>

06:26.859 --> 06:27.808
Proof.

06:27.809 --> 06:30.585
So I'm going to give you an AK-47,
I'm going to take an M-16.

06:30.586 --> 06:32.654
- We're going to fire on those kids...
- Have anything in heavy metal?

06:32.855 --> 06:35.999
Like lead... mercury?

06:38.578 --> 06:41.587
- No.
- Oh my God.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.937
Been a slice.
But I have other police work to do.

06:47.384 --> 06:51.233
This is real, Lou.  You gonna see
an eye when I do is citizen arrest

06:51.234 --> 06:53.169
on a teenager with a fucking shotgun.

06:53.170 --> 06:55.800
Remember what happened to
the boy that cried wolf, Willie.

06:59.469 --> 07:03.470
Nothing happened to him.
But that town's flock was fucked.

07:03.907 --> 07:05.895
Town's flock was fucked.

07:08.373 --> 07:11.977
<i>Lou, come in.
You there?  Over.</i>

07:13.027 --> 07:14.341
Go ahead.

07:14.617 --> 07:16.898
<i>How did that thing go with Higens?</i>

07:17.199 --> 07:19.395
Ah, a bunch of kids
partying in the woods.

07:19.696 --> 07:22.135
Following up a possible lead now.

07:37.611 --> 07:39.045
Your usual.

07:43.349 --> 07:45.483
Stocking up for the Drink n Shoot?

07:45.510 --> 07:50.103
Thanks to our forefathers, in two days,
this bar will be full of drunk hunters.

07:50.104 --> 07:53.526
That's what we need.  Bunch of
drunks with guns running around.

07:56.131 --> 07:59.773
Very funny.  I'll have you know
I haven't fired mine in years.

07:59.774 --> 08:01.472
Are you sure you
still know how to use it?

08:02.228 --> 08:07.459
Jess, whiskey for my boys
and water for my horses.

08:14.032 --> 08:15.497
Deputy.

08:20.213 --> 08:22.785
Keeping the streets safe I see.

08:25.388 --> 08:27.219
Come on.
Beat it!

08:30.500 --> 08:33.384
It's time for a change, Woodhaven.

08:34.014 --> 08:38.929
It's time to take on those who run
this town with the drugs and corruption.

08:41.472 --> 08:46.633
Our local law enforcement has done nothing
for generations, and Mayor Bradley,

08:46.668 --> 08:50.401
she's more concerned with selling
this town than with running it.

08:51.666 --> 08:53.988
It's time we clean up Woodhaven,

08:53.989 --> 08:59.049
and a vote for Wallace
is a vote for change.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.099
Vote for Wallace!

09:13.768 --> 09:19.689
Number 1, number 2, 3, 4...

09:25.075 --> 09:28.086
Hello!
Hello.

09:30.401 --> 09:32.806
- Did you find anything?
- Anything?

09:32.807 --> 09:37.820
- The disturbance calls.
- Just some kids partying in the bush.

09:37.959 --> 09:42.839
Well.  Seems like they're at it again.
We just got another complain.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.594
Maybe you could catch him
in the act for a change.

09:45.795 --> 09:48.450
Well, I just started my shift.
I could take it.

09:48.451 --> 09:52.057
No, Mr Phinias will be here.
He can deal with it.  There you go.

09:52.258 --> 09:56.504
Maybe try getting off your
bar-stool this time.  Just this once.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.531
Party's over!
Pack it up!

11:18.484 --> 11:23.015
Save you the pay for work.
Go the fuck home.

11:35.155 --> 11:37.464
Aaargh!

11:58.312 --> 11:59.718
What the hell?

12:03.192 --> 12:06.042
- You!
- Behind you.

13:29.998 --> 13:33.298
- Hello.
- You're awake?  I'm impressed.

13:33.299 --> 13:37.134
- Who's this coming in?  What's up?
- Well, there's been an incident.

14:11.754 --> 14:16.462
- Hey!  Don't do that.
- Or what?

15:03.789 --> 15:05.541
You forget to shave?

15:07.306 --> 15:08.790
Follow me.

15:16.972 --> 15:18.927
Yeah.  Terry Wallace.

15:19.228 --> 15:22.537
Mayoral race just got a
whole lot easier to call.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.255
Hello.  Did you see anything
suspicious last night?

15:33.597 --> 15:36.581
Just didn't peg Terry for a junkie.

15:36.623 --> 15:39.753
Yeah, sometimes people wear
different face in public.

15:39.754 --> 15:44.107
Especially politicians.
It's a shame.  He had my vote.

15:47.621 --> 15:51.642
Ahh.  Thank you.
Here we go.

15:52.441 --> 15:54.209
Well, that's why I want to try **.

15:54.210 --> 15:56.834
Hunter found him this morning.
Called it in.

15:56.835 --> 15:59.144
Looks like he called
the whole town too.

16:02.746 --> 16:03.717
Fuck!

16:03.718 --> 16:06.422
I never saw Terry
as much of a hunter.

16:09.459 --> 16:11.652
What about the neck wound?

16:12.725 --> 16:15.265
I imagine the critter
got to him last night.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.422
Keep your eye open
for a stoned coyote.

16:17.623 --> 16:20.779
Well, I mean is it an
attack or or is it an OD?

16:20.780 --> 16:25.111
Terms of cause of death, I'm leaning
towards an OD but I'll need an autopsy.

16:25.112 --> 16:27.860
All right now, Terry is
a well known figure so

16:27.861 --> 16:31.345
we keep this quiet until we
got all the facts, alright?

16:34.277 --> 16:36.924
Mayor, was this an animal attack?

16:37.025 --> 16:40.425
Well, of course we can't comment
on all the details at the moment,

16:40.426 --> 16:44.845
but, as you know
it is our top priority.

16:44.846 --> 16:46.637
How will this impact the festival?

16:46.738 --> 16:50.209
Well, I think in the
wake of this tragedy,

16:50.410 --> 16:54.065
the Drink n Shoot is going
to have to be canceled.

16:54.066 --> 16:55.266
<i>Oh no!</i>

17:20.891 --> 17:23.492
- What is it Tina?
- How do you know it was me?

17:23.594 --> 17:26.259
- I smelt your perfume.
- I didn't wear any.

17:29.522 --> 17:31.123
You buying this?

17:31.501 --> 17:34.285
Feels oddly familiar, no?

17:34.793 --> 17:37.892
I'm not trying to dredge up the past.
I'm just saying.

17:37.927 --> 17:41.040
When was the last time they
canceled the Drink n' Shoot?

17:42.391 --> 17:44.891
I know where you're going
with this and I'm not biting.

17:44.892 --> 17:46.419
Just saying.

17:48.941 --> 17:51.015
No, shit!

18:01.843 --> 18:05.456
I'm standing in the forest where
locals have gathered for generations

18:05.457 --> 18:09.340
drink in hand to hunt the
mystical Woodhaven beast.

18:09.341 --> 18:14.684
<i>Today, this annual tradition is in
jeopardy due to a gruesome discovery.</i>

18:18.320 --> 18:20.486
To Terry Wallace.

18:25.254 --> 18:27.171
Such a shame about Terry.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.451
This town could have
used some of your blood.

18:29.452 --> 18:32.044
- Wallace certainly got it today.
- Wooh.

18:32.045 --> 18:33.275
Too soon?

18:35.099 --> 18:37.401
You know everyone in town.

18:37.502 --> 18:41.622
Popular, very pretty.
Maybe you should run.

18:41.623 --> 18:44.313
You think I'd give Mayor Bradley
a run for her money?

18:44.514 --> 18:47.647
- You got my vote.
- Mine too.

18:48.048 --> 18:51.322
You don't have to ask.
What's this?

18:52.646 --> 18:54.985
- Police work.
- Really?

18:55.785 --> 18:56.722
What?

18:56.723 --> 18:59.859
I just don't think I've ever seen
you do actual work before.

19:00.160 --> 19:04.164
Well, as Terry normally said,
it's time for a change.

19:09.876 --> 19:12.860
Alright, we're closing early tonight.
Down it or drain it.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.419
What the fuck for?

19:15.027 --> 19:18.747
- Private party.
- What the fuck!

19:19.648 --> 19:22.503
Don't worry, we'll be
here tomorrow, I promise.

19:22.504 --> 19:24.861
Fucking bullshit!

19:26.726 --> 19:30.690
Alright, these will keep you
company while I'm gone.

19:31.478 --> 19:35.718
Friday morning better...
I think you're trying to get me drunk.

19:52.493 --> 19:56.300
- Almost done, handsome.
- No rush.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.341
- Everything alright?
- Yeah.  You?

21:04.442 --> 21:08.964
- You want to get out of here?
- That is the best idea I've heard all day.

21:11.984 --> 21:14.516
Whoo!
You alright fella?

21:14.517 --> 21:16.745
Ooh!
Must have eaten something funky.

21:17.204 --> 21:20.436
- Well, let's get you to bed.
- That sounds...

21:24.154 --> 21:26.050
I'll be right back.

22:38.202 --> 22:39.418
What the...

22:39.419 --> 22:41.103
Aaargh!

22:41.597 --> 22:42.824
Eeeargh!

22:43.114 --> 22:46.549
Aaargh!

22:48.179 --> 22:49.482
Aaah!

24:32.247 --> 24:34.558
Oh!  What the fuck!

24:42.323 --> 24:43.693
Jessica!

24:49.543 --> 24:53.023
Morning, Lou Garou.
How's your butt?

24:53.024 --> 24:54.646
Willie, what the hell?

24:54.647 --> 24:59.156
I'm sorry man.  I don't
take cops.  I improvised.

24:59.157 --> 25:00.929
What the hell's gotten into you?

25:00.930 --> 25:04.139
Oh, that's exactly
what I was going to ask you.

25:07.587 --> 25:08.899
Play.

25:13.399 --> 25:17.977
- What are you showing me?
- That's you, Lou.  Last night.

25:18.526 --> 25:21.342
This is Willie.
I just shot Lou Garou.

25:21.343 --> 25:25.286
He's a fucking wolf.  I just put
3 tranqs right into his back.

25:25.287 --> 25:29.909
Lou?  Wolf.
Fucking, he's out.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.273
So who's crying wolf now?

25:38.143 --> 25:41.250
Ok ok.  So I washed
your uniform last night.

25:41.551 --> 25:44.700
It was a little dirty dirty,
so I put it in the cold cycle.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.520
A lot of blood.

25:47.265 --> 25:49.362
I'm going to make you some breakfast.

25:54.178 --> 25:57.640
- I think you shrunk it.
- What?  What was that?

25:58.131 --> 26:01.212
Thank you Willie for helping me.
You're welcome.

26:01.213 --> 26:03.933
I could throw you in jail
for kidnapping an officer.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.707
Yeah you could and
I could sell you to science.

26:06.708 --> 26:10.180
- You are a real fucking guy, Willie.
- Thank you.

26:12.744 --> 26:15.519
Now for the secret ingredient.

26:16.236 --> 26:18.196
You thirsty boy?

26:22.470 --> 26:23.943
Have a dog.

26:31.717 --> 26:33.785
Man, he likes to party.

26:47.358 --> 26:50.292
- That proves it.
- What the fuck!

26:50.293 --> 26:53.624
Wolfbane!  It was what we call
as vampire wolfbane.  It's the...

26:53.625 --> 26:55.102
Don't say it.

26:55.103 --> 26:58.260
It's what you are. The things got your
fucking senses going into overdrive.

26:58.361 --> 27:02.867
Hey. I want you to listen.  You may or
you may not just start to get your period.

27:04.617 --> 27:06.973
I'm gonna make you some new eggs.

27:09.243 --> 27:12.586
Don't bother.
Tina's coming.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.425
I'll be damned.

27:23.050 --> 27:25.267
Now, last night was the full moon.

27:25.268 --> 27:28.843
So I did some research in
between now and the solar eclipse.

27:28.944 --> 27:31.656
- I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.
- For how long?

27:32.159 --> 27:34.727
Two days, give or take.

27:35.327 --> 27:38.701
But Lou, we gonna have
to lock you up tonight.

27:39.891 --> 27:42.323
Come by the station at dusk.

27:46.624 --> 27:49.043
Jesus, Lou.  I've been
looking everywhere.

27:49.044 --> 27:51.048
Good morning to you too.
What's your panic?

27:51.049 --> 27:54.119
There's been another incident.
Jessica's bar.

27:58.331 --> 28:00.404
Say, how did you
find me anyway?

28:01.105 --> 28:04.353
It might come as a surprise
but I'm a police officer.

28:21.465 --> 28:24.254
Lou, you know I've given up
expecting you to be a great cop.

28:24.255 --> 28:28.310
But the least you could do is
be a cop that shows up on time.

28:29.092 --> 28:34.348
Now, I don't know if you're ashamed, but
I do know that your dad sure shit would be.

28:35.735 --> 28:40.201
- Jessie, thank you. We'll keep you posted.
- Well, thank you Ray.

28:41.011 --> 28:44.347
Make yourself useful.
See Jessie to her car.

28:48.540 --> 28:51.568
Chief, with all due respect,
between this and Wallace,

28:51.569 --> 28:55.211
I think we're in over our head.  Might
be time to bring someone in from the city.

28:55.312 --> 28:58.001
This stays local.
You understand?

28:59.738 --> 29:03.448
Maybe you could stop trying to do
my job and secure the crime scene.

29:03.449 --> 29:06.415
- Mmm.  How about that?
- Aah.

29:33.745 --> 29:39.422
- Jess, I'm really sorry. I don't know...
- You weren't yourself, Lou.

29:39.523 --> 29:42.601
- You didn't do this.
- Did I hurt you?

29:42.602 --> 29:46.372
No.  No, you saved me.

29:48.002 --> 29:49.560
We'll talk later.

29:56.302 --> 29:57.482
Lou.

30:10.390 --> 30:13.560
That is some gnarly shit.

30:31.270 --> 30:32.592
Don't!

30:36.478 --> 30:37.860
Like a face.

30:38.803 --> 30:40.544
Hey, kind of looks like you.

30:41.356 --> 30:46.289
Oh, sorry I'm late, Chief.
Had to stop by at the Buritt.

30:46.290 --> 30:48.280
Do some investigating.

30:57.088 --> 31:00.726
So if you had to guess,
what happened here?

31:00.727 --> 31:02.640
Two dead man in the bathroom,

31:02.841 --> 31:06.597
if not for the excess of severed flesh,
I would have guessed lovers quarrel.

31:08.042 --> 31:12.310
- Is that animal hair?
- I don't know. What do you think Lou?

31:21.071 --> 31:23.973
Look! You've been covering me
a lot lately.  Why don't you take off?

31:23.974 --> 31:25.390
I'll cover the night shift.

31:26.929 --> 31:30.063
- Are you drunk?
- That would be nice.

31:30.064 --> 31:33.819
- Nice?
- Yeah.

31:36.848 --> 31:38.054
Okay.

31:44.414 --> 31:46.830
Well, this is nice.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.542
One simple task.

32:07.264 --> 32:09.196
Not to cop out..

32:09.229 --> 32:11.156
and blow into me by 10 pm.

32:11.157 --> 32:14.415
- Boss, we tried, but when we got there...
- You were late!

32:16.976 --> 32:20.561
Timing is everything.

32:20.862 --> 32:23.713
It's how the world runs,
it's how...

32:23.714 --> 32:25.946
a business thrives.

32:27.241 --> 32:30.225
Every second is precious.

32:32.229 --> 32:38.129
Cause you see, time... is the
one thing that money can't buy.

32:38.265 --> 32:42.393
- But he wasn't a... He was a...
- A what?

32:42.394 --> 32:44.548
A big fucking wolf.

32:46.774 --> 32:50.453
- A wolf?
- Yeah.  Fucking yeah.

32:50.454 --> 32:55.395
Now are you sure that your
eyes weren't playing tricks on you?

32:55.596 --> 32:58.237
I saw what I saw with my own eye.

32:59.593 --> 33:01.977
Well, let's see then shall we?

33:11.875 --> 33:15.047
Keep your eye on the time.

33:16.568 --> 33:18.335
You dumb fuck!

34:30.382 --> 34:31.670
Hey!

34:32.531 --> 34:34.958
You got any books on devil worship?

34:39.572 --> 34:43.694
- Where did you find this?
- Library.  It's been ... for use.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.683
- The eee like jee, but I don't get this.
- Werewolves.

34:48.994 --> 34:52.389
It says here, werewolves are
created in a baptism of blood.

34:52.954 --> 34:56.369
The sacrifice of an innocent
turns another into a beast.

34:57.649 --> 35:00.341
Yeah, that makes total sense.

35:04.039 --> 35:07.064
According to this, werewolves
are pretty much impossible to kill

35:07.065 --> 35:10.569
during phases of the full moon.
So it's usually a village idiot.

35:10.570 --> 35:13.726
Village idiot?
Hey Lou, this is a book about you.

35:15.589 --> 35:20.148
Someone easily contained
leading up to the reckoning.

35:20.149 --> 35:21.384
What the hell is that?

35:21.385 --> 35:24.440
I'm not a werewolf expert, man.
I don't know.

35:24.741 --> 35:27.140
The reckoning.
The reason for the ritual.

35:27.141 --> 35:29.430
The blood of beast is
drained during the solar eclipse

35:29.431 --> 35:30.861
and the wolf is rendered weak.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.590
Who the hell is my werewolf, Bud?

35:32.791 --> 35:35.367
Looks like changeling,
shape-shifters.

35:35.368 --> 35:38.617
Apparently the blood of one werewolf
can maintain their power for decades.

35:38.618 --> 35:42.269
What do they do?
Crystallize it, drink it up like Tang?

35:42.270 --> 35:44.208
Who fucking does that?

35:46.284 --> 35:48.184
What to do think of
myself when I'm a wolf?

35:48.585 --> 35:52.334
I recognise you, man.
Same uniform plus you know...

35:52.535 --> 35:55.306
You were drunk, so
I knew it was you.  Why?

35:56.143 --> 36:00.538
Well, we found 2 dead men this morning,
ripped to shreds in a bathroom.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.945
And you think that was the hairy you?

36:04.046 --> 36:08.641
Oh, I remember an attack.
Don't remember killing anyone, though.

36:08.842 --> 36:11.865
You did seem like freak.
You're so strong, right?

36:11.866 --> 36:14.671
You had all those...
teeth and those claws.

36:14.672 --> 36:17.225
Plus you got that,
you know, low self esteem,

36:17.226 --> 36:20.178
more like you daddy issues,
you now call it,

36:20.179 --> 36:22.059
so you gotta have some rage, right?

36:22.060 --> 36:24.179
That's a lethal combo, man.
I would have killed myself.

36:24.180 --> 36:26.386
But hey, don't worry man.

36:27.487 --> 36:32.401
Horse strength.
Street name: See You in a Fucking Week.

36:32.402 --> 36:34.996
Jesus, Willie, that's
enough to drop a hippo.

36:35.197 --> 36:37.594
That's the plan.
Shit!

36:41.339 --> 36:46.291
- Tweedle dee, tweedle dum.
- Just taking an official noise statement

36:46.292 --> 36:49.310
- on those noise complaints.
- I made it... I means since his arrest.

36:49.811 --> 36:54.718
Okay.  You stay awake now.
You call me if anything comes up.

36:55.147 --> 36:58.170
You bet.
Ah, yes sir.

36:59.224 --> 37:03.056
Fuck!
Christ.

37:21.621 --> 37:26.541
Lou!  I'm so nervous.
Oh, I'm excited and nervous.

37:26.642 --> 37:29.736
- Yeah.
- Yeah.  It's exhilarating.

37:30.520 --> 37:35.717
- Okay. Now, take off your gitch.
- No.

37:35.818 --> 37:39.732
- Yeah, yeah.  Take it off. For science.
- I'm not taking my gitch off, Willie.

37:39.733 --> 37:42.246
Lose your gitch for science.
Lose your gitch.

37:42.647 --> 37:46.621
Okay, turn around, hands
on the wall, bend over...

37:46.722 --> 37:48.525
I'm just...
I'm talking about the...

37:48.526 --> 37:53.991
Now you can, fucking just like
transform right in that spot.

37:54.092 --> 37:56.081
- Really?
- We got a shot.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.891
Take off your gitch.
It's for science, man.

37:58.892 --> 38:01.208
Just forget the gitch.

38:02.827 --> 38:06.675
Hello.
You guys shooting a movie?

38:07.146 --> 38:11.546
What?  No!
It's a science movie.

38:11.975 --> 38:16.913
Lou, can I talk to you for a second.
Alone.

38:20.986 --> 38:23.534
I'll be back in a minute
and forty five seconds.

38:25.184 --> 38:29.124
- What's going on with you?
- What do you mean?

38:29.125 --> 38:33.296
You've gone from lazy to weird.  And
you're spending a lot of time with Willie.

38:34.351 --> 38:37.806
- He's helping me.
- Willie, is helping you?

38:38.107 --> 38:41.021
- Okay, well now I'm worried.
- You wouldn't understand.

38:41.022 --> 38:45.239
Wouldn't I?  Willie, you and I
have more in common than not.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.546
You know why I became a cop?

38:48.517 --> 38:49.866
It's a long story.

38:49.867 --> 38:52.506
My dad used to run the bar.
Chesterâ€™s Bar.

38:52.507 --> 38:55.100
He got mixed up in the
wrong crowd, and...

38:55.501 --> 38:58.792
And when he went missing, your dad
was the only one that tried to find him.

38:58.793 --> 39:01.160
- The only one who cared.
- I already know this.

39:01.161 --> 39:04.052
I don't believe your father's
death was an accident.

39:04.666 --> 39:10.236
Anymore than I believe my father was killed
by an animal attack, like Terry Wallace.

39:10.789 --> 39:14.613
I know this town has secrets,
but if you don't want to trust me...

39:15.967 --> 39:18.865
just... be safe.

39:23.591 --> 39:28.071
Can I have my shots?
Appreciate your concern.

39:31.225 --> 39:34.728
- Lou, what does she want?
- Nothing.

39:34.729 --> 39:40.764
Okay.
Is it almost... time?

39:40.765 --> 39:42.454
Sure, you don't want that pill?

39:42.455 --> 39:45.133
It didn't hurt, man.
You just... put it right up.

39:45.487 --> 39:47.723
I should do this sober.

39:50.188 --> 39:51.317
Easy.

40:12.038 --> 40:13.595
Showtime.

40:54.900 --> 40:56.141
Shit!

40:57.100 --> 40:58.716
It's not recording.

41:23.020 --> 41:26.324
You know, it's like the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen man.

41:26.325 --> 41:28.945
You what?
No, it's beautiful.

41:30.617 --> 41:32.187
Is that a ***?

41:34.519 --> 41:36.091
No, I'm good, I'm done.

41:40.418 --> 41:44.276
Oh!  Okay, okay!

41:55.422 --> 41:56.732
Jesus Christ.

42:04.060 --> 42:05.481
You got to be kidding me.

42:05.482 --> 42:08.712
You want fucking... doughnuts.

42:14.026 --> 42:17.041
I don't even know what it means,
man, because I tell you in that dream

42:17.042 --> 42:20.527
I mean, you look pretty
and it hurt so good.

42:20.995 --> 42:22.282
Go fish.

42:24.610 --> 42:29.336
Lou, it's not...
Hey, it's not that you play... fish.

42:29.437 --> 42:32.165
We've been playing for about
3 hours, you should probably

42:32.166 --> 42:36.786
Take one card.
Take three card.

42:36.787 --> 42:38.651
Did you... did you get a match?

42:41.658 --> 42:44.733
No, Lou.
Pop your fucking brakes.

42:49.600 --> 42:53.001
- Lou, this is not a good idea.
- Robbery.

42:54.163 --> 42:59.819
- Lou, you're a wolf.
- Cop!

43:18.750 --> 43:21.180
Last one.
Hurry.

43:30.580 --> 43:33.019
Oh man.
That's some fucking dream.

43:33.420 --> 43:34.659
Shut it!

43:40.211 --> 43:41.619
Drop it!

43:49.295 --> 43:51.303
What the fuck are you?

43:52.446 --> 43:54.243
The voice.

43:55.123 --> 43:56.954
Show yourself.

43:58.402 --> 43:59.658
Fuck!

44:01.929 --> 44:04.773
Get up.
I've got half the guests.

44:07.452 --> 44:10.223
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

44:23.996 --> 44:26.236
Thank you officer.

44:33.802 --> 44:37.199
Hey Lou, don't forget to murder
someone else on the way to the car.

44:37.200 --> 44:39.173
Low profile man!

44:42.765 --> 44:46.779
Well done, Lou.  That's one more
thing for us to explain now, man.

44:46.780 --> 44:48.456
Why don't you just
go run down the street,

44:48.457 --> 44:50.415
we all talking about
how you act for man.

44:50.416 --> 44:53.546
Could we get out of here, we go home
before you blow down the whole town?

44:53.547 --> 44:54.690
What?

44:57.651 --> 45:01.498
I know what you're
thinking and I approve.

45:02.978 --> 45:04.399
Fuck them!

46:04.707 --> 46:07.968
- Hey Lou.
- You called?

46:11.794 --> 46:14.947
Okay, you pinched you ride,
now what?

46:15.681 --> 46:18.493
Oh, it's that way.

46:22.909 --> 46:24.292
***

46:26.196 --> 46:28.103
Yikes, don't spray!

46:32.169 --> 46:33.467
Aargh!

46:36.579 --> 46:39.146
I think you're in too much asparagus.

46:40.069 --> 46:41.836
Let's roll.

46:49.894 --> 46:52.253
This is fucking cool!

46:57.198 --> 46:59.807
You got fucking rabies.

47:09.924 --> 47:13.526
- This is still a crime scene.
- You gonna arrest me?

47:13.890 --> 47:17.230
No.  I just have a few
follow up questions.

47:17.231 --> 47:19.271
Well, I have nothing further to add.

47:20.778 --> 47:22.541
How about a drink then?

47:24.659 --> 47:29.057
You know?  I used to sit right
here when I was a little girl.

47:29.458 --> 47:33.134
Drinking Shirley Temples
and watching my dad work.

47:35.312 --> 47:38.179
- Tina here.
- This dispatch.  Attempted robbery

47:38.180 --> 47:41.183
<i>reported at Liquor & Doughnuts.
Reports are of a gang of pigs and </i>

47:41.184 --> 47:43.877
<i>- and large wolf on the scene.
- What?</i>

47:49.163 --> 47:52.935
Cheers.
Bitch!

48:26.015 --> 48:28.331
No one comes in.
Got it?

48:56.296 --> 48:58.203
<i>Chief, come in.
Tina here.</i>

48:58.304 --> 49:02.450
<i>There's been an incident at
Liquor & Doughnuts.  Two dead.  Piggies.</i>

49:03.310 --> 49:04.917
Motherfucker!

49:18.419 --> 49:23.401
Lou, Lou!  Keep your steering wheel
there, man.  We gotta head back.

49:26.316 --> 49:30.535
Hey, what do you smell?
What the fuck are you sniffing?

49:44.645 --> 49:47.957
We're out of road, man!
Think about this, man!

50:00.274 --> 50:01.963
Go on!
Get out of here!

50:15.110 --> 50:16.339
Fuck me!

50:31.534 --> 50:32.853
Fucking...

50:34.692 --> 50:36.975
There's gotta be more, sir!

50:52.155 --> 50:53.473
Not again!

51:08.231 --> 51:09.869
Lou!  Watch your back.

51:21.973 --> 51:23.631
That's really bad!

51:26.702 --> 51:30.005
Hey! We got a
really fucking problem.

51:40.838 --> 51:42.008
Lou!

51:42.407 --> 51:44.892
Lab's exploding man.
Let's go.

51:49.985 --> 51:51.738
Let's go, Lou.  Now!

51:51.822 --> 51:54.439
That's a meth.
Come on Lou.

51:56.219 --> 51:57.605
Nice work.

51:57.606 --> 51:59.654
Sorry, really ain't good in fighting.

51:59.655 --> 52:01.680
- Place of work!
- Let's go.

52:05.376 --> 52:08.782
It's got a bomb.
It's got a bomb.

52:29.378 --> 52:33.022
Tina, two dead robbers.
I mean, what happened?

52:33.023 --> 52:35.241
- It wasn't me.
- Well, where is Lou?

52:35.242 --> 52:36.657
- No idea.
- Well goddamn it,

52:36.658 --> 52:37.800
he's suppose to be on duty.

52:37.816 --> 52:41.549
- Maybe it was a vigilante.
- Well, did you at least get a description.

52:41.550 --> 52:44.138
Ah ha ha.  I did.
Tell him what you told me.

52:44.539 --> 52:47.417
It was a big fucking wolf cop.

52:50.004 --> 52:51.688
Tina here.

52:54.978 --> 52:58.501
There's a fire.  Route 13 just off
junction 8.  Fire trucks are on the way.

52:58.502 --> 53:01.328
You got to be fucking kidding me.

53:11.862 --> 53:15.530
You know, I think we need to lay low.
There's a guy running around with no face.

53:15.831 --> 53:19.236
Like you clearly ripped
his whole face right off.

53:20.264 --> 53:22.324
Good evening, gentlemen.

53:22.325 --> 53:24.565
Oohhh.

53:25.047 --> 53:27.463
I'm ready to give my statement now.

53:27.677 --> 53:31.350
- Yeah, I don't think this is a good idea.
- Say bye bye, Willie.

53:31.351 --> 53:35.153
- He is much stronger than you.
- He'll be in good hands.

53:35.254 --> 53:40.046
For your safety you should keep him
away from booze and doughnuts.

53:41.047 --> 53:43.333
I'm just...

53:45.289 --> 53:48.146
Hey, you call me if you need any...

53:49.043 --> 53:51.202
I'll just go fuck myself.

53:52.294 --> 53:56.314
Look here.
What big teeth you have.

53:58.389 --> 54:01.718
Whoo, that's not all.

54:17.466 --> 54:18.959
Hey, Jim he...

56:18.730 --> 56:20.959
I don't want you to
take this the wrong way.

56:22.005 --> 56:26.349
I'm glad I waited this sleep with
this improved version of you.

56:59.100 --> 57:01.205
Everything alright, lover?

57:18.840 --> 57:20.450
I'm sorry, Lou.

57:21.183 --> 57:24.159
But there is a lot about me
you just don't know.

57:28.052 --> 57:33.164
To be truth, but that's I thought
we were getting along so well.

57:35.816 --> 57:40.146
Now dear, good doggie, lie down.

57:43.643 --> 57:46.678
Such a beautiful creature.

58:00.459 --> 58:03.047
Boss, we thought you were dead.

58:04.431 --> 58:08.603
Gather the men.  Meet me at
Enders Road in two hours.

58:30.146 --> 58:33.000
Okay.
Okay.

58:45.762 --> 58:50.591
Now that you successfully bug the
wolf right out of him, that's disgusting.

58:51.959 --> 58:53.453
You're slipping.

58:54.314 --> 58:57.487
You've got one job,
and one job only.

58:57.988 --> 59:01.050
Contain the prey until the eclipse.

59:01.151 --> 59:04.897
- This one's different.
- I don't give a good Goddamn.

59:04.898 --> 59:07.017
He was your responsibility.

59:07.018 --> 59:10.810
I think this one is going to give us
some problem during the hunt, okay.

59:10.811 --> 59:13.342
I've been documenting his whole process

59:13.343 --> 59:16.745
and I'm trying to figure out why
he's stronger than all the others.

59:16.746 --> 59:19.497
Let me tell you something.
He's a lot stronger.

59:19.798 --> 59:21.912
- Why?
- Well, you tell me.

59:22.012 --> 59:24.320
Lou Garou is not my choice.

59:24.321 --> 59:27.569
Well, it doesn't make any sense, okay.
Well, it's just... This guy's a loser.

59:28.224 --> 59:30.987
Unless it has something
to do with the liquor.

59:31.071 --> 59:34.591
You know what would
happen if anybody saw that.

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.110
What are you up to?

01:00:34.176 --> 01:00:36.586
What the fuck?

01:01:09.151 --> 01:01:10.283
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

01:01:10.284 --> 01:01:13.213
<i>You speaking of sunglasses at night,
be sure to wear them today kiddies.</i>

01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:15.874
<i>Because, it's one hour
to the solar eclipse.</i>

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:17.442
<i>And if you stare directly at it Dan, </i>

01:01:17.443 --> 01:01:20.381
<i>- You will go blind.
- Interesting trivia.</i>

01:01:20.382 --> 01:01:23.411
<i>32 years ago, was the last time
the Drink and Shoot was canceled.</i>

01:01:23.412 --> 01:01:26.858
<i>Here's summer calling it,
the curse of the eclipse.</i>

01:01:26.859 --> 01:01:29.196
<i>So how long is this
solar buzz to last?</i>

01:01:29.197 --> 01:01:31.393
<i>The inter-web says
seven and a half minutes.</i>

01:01:31.394 --> 01:01:33.682
<i>So if you idiots gonna
put your eyes long enough</i>

01:01:33.683 --> 01:01:35.128
<i>you should be okay.</i>

01:01:35.129 --> 01:01:37.076
<i>Wow, seven and a half whole minutes.</i>

01:01:37.077 --> 01:01:39.839
<i>- I know that will be tough for you.
- That will be tough for me.</i>

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.916
<i>Hey, the eclipse thing and weather
coming after this word from our sponsor.</i>

01:01:42.917 --> 01:01:46.122
<i>You guessed it.
Liquor and Doughnuts.</i>

01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:10.122
- What's the plan, boss?
- What the fuck are you wearing?

01:02:10.123 --> 01:02:12.392
Have you seen what we're up against?

01:02:12.793 --> 01:02:17.676
Watch the perimeter.
You shoot anything with a heartbeat.

01:02:18.457 --> 01:02:19.536
Come on!

01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:07.018
You know what they say, Lou.

01:03:07.319 --> 01:03:11.947
Keep you friends close,
but your enemies closer.

01:03:14.469 --> 01:03:17.873
I'm just fucking with you, man.
I'm a shape shifter.

01:03:27.981 --> 01:03:31.499
Help!

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.528
Scream all you want, Lou.

01:03:33.529 --> 01:03:36.850
For as it is empty, we
canceled the Drink and Shoot.

01:03:40.078 --> 01:03:42.669
How long you shape shifters
been running this town?

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:45.160
Two hundred years, give or take.

01:03:45.161 --> 01:03:48.528
It takes a lot of work
and a lot of sacrifice.

01:03:49.329 --> 01:03:53.017
Can't believe I slept with
a 200 year old woman.

01:03:53.018 --> 01:03:55.214
Who said I'm a woman?

01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:01.143
Aye, this isn't our first picnic, man.

01:04:01.344 --> 01:04:03.540
Your strength comes from the night.

01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:09.136
All this rather shitty little town.
Not the most ambitious bunch, are you?

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:14.513
Oh, you'll be surprised, how far up a
ladder a little novice blood can go.

01:04:42.185 --> 01:04:45.059
No time.
Stay focused.

01:05:43.911 --> 01:05:45.483
He's a killer.

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.845
It's easier that way.

01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:06.394
Sorry, it had to be you man.

01:06:13.055 --> 01:06:14.158
Uhh!

01:06:25.939 --> 01:06:31.252
- Less than 8 minutes.
- Guess, you're man. And get me that wolf.

01:07:04.172 --> 01:07:06.615
Big, fuck wolf!

01:07:09.704 --> 01:07:12.806
No...!

01:07:14.995 --> 01:07:17.614
Goodnight, sweet friend.

01:07:27.173 --> 01:07:29.253
Hands, where I can see them.

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:33.347
- Move, and die.
- Tina!

01:07:33.348 --> 01:07:35.270
You don't understand.

01:07:35.571 --> 01:07:39.188
We're protecting
Woodhaven from that beast.

01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:41.013
Save it, wolf fucker!

01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:43.555
Hands behind your head.

01:07:44.714 --> 01:07:47.338
You're making a big mistake.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:53.137
You know, the last wolf
I fucked was your father.

01:08:37.077 --> 01:08:38.386
Boss?

01:08:39.917 --> 01:08:41.912
Why are you dressed like that?

01:08:52.017 --> 01:08:53.443
Fuck you!

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:57.252
Not so tough now, are you, huh?

01:09:05.122 --> 01:09:06.040
No!

01:10:11.963 --> 01:10:13.608
Nice one, huh?

01:10:14.707 --> 01:10:16.525
Back at ya.

01:10:23.546 --> 01:10:28.483
- We should get out of here.
- Yeah.

01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:36.629
This is your fate, Lou.

01:10:41.619 --> 01:10:45.816
Like your nosy father.
I need to put you down.

01:10:45.817 --> 01:10:49.871
It's funny.
This is the exact spot of new sacrifice.

01:10:50.172 --> 01:10:52.723
Nice continuity to it,
don't you think?

01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:56.259
Well, Tina.

01:11:21.722 --> 01:11:23.585
I'm impressed, Lou Garou.

01:11:23.886 --> 01:11:26.835
But it's time to serve your purpose.

01:11:34.598 --> 01:11:36.462
Big mistake.

01:11:48.014 --> 01:11:50.251
How does that feel?

01:12:06.465 --> 01:12:08.663
Let's end this, Lou.

01:12:15.149 --> 01:12:17.101
What do you expect to...?

01:12:25.949 --> 01:12:27.972
A promotion.

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:14.313
Get up Lou.

01:13:25.784 --> 01:13:27.237
Are you okay?

01:13:31.811 --> 01:13:33.994
Yah, I could use a drink.

01:13:35.798 --> 01:13:41.025
- I could use a hospital.
- Okay, two stops.
