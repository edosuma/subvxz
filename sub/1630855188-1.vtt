WEBVTT

00:51.361 --> 00:52.569
Running low, Frank.

00:53.605 --> 00:56.504
Enough to make it back?

00:56.539 --> 00:59.024
Yeah, just enough.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.412
Doesn't look I'm
making this thing back.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.247
There's only one
more plane to make--

01:18.492 --> 01:19.389
Yeah, Mike.

01:19.424 --> 01:20.735
I'm still up for more.

01:20.770 --> 01:24.049
Thanks for reminding me again.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.086
Hey, I'm just
doing my job, man.

01:29.917 --> 01:32.126
All right.
Let's head back.

01:34.163 --> 01:34.853
Roger that.

01:50.765 --> 01:51.421
Easy

01:56.806 --> 01:59.602
Mike, there's a train down here.

01:59.636 --> 02:00.534
I'm going to take a pass.

02:10.820 --> 02:11.924
Roger that.

02:11.959 --> 02:12.822
Make it fast.

02:12.856 --> 02:15.549
I'm running low on fuel.

02:15.583 --> 02:16.239
And me.

02:19.173 --> 02:19.967
Right.

02:20.001 --> 02:21.831
That's why I said make it fast.

03:03.873 --> 03:06.496
Man, I love when
those trains explode.

03:06.531 --> 03:07.187
Woo!

03:10.604 --> 03:11.294
Just in time.

03:19.509 --> 03:20.476
Roger that.

03:45.397 --> 03:46.087
Mike?

03:56.374 --> 03:57.064
Mike!

04:10.836 --> 04:12.321
No!

04:12.355 --> 04:13.045
No.

04:29.614 --> 04:31.167
Mayday, mayday.

04:31.201 --> 04:34.688
This is Little Blue, over.

04:34.722 --> 04:35.378
Mayday.

04:35.413 --> 04:36.759
Code red.

04:56.779 --> 04:58.332
Come on, you piece of shit.

06:57.278 --> 07:00.212
How much further you reckon
these white soldiers are?

07:00.247 --> 07:01.559
They should be just up ahead.

07:04.527 --> 07:06.253
I haven't seen a
minefield all day.

07:06.287 --> 07:07.599
Well, that's the point, Salty.

07:07.634 --> 07:09.808
You're not supposed
to see a mine.

07:09.843 --> 07:13.156
That's why we find them
and disassemble them.

07:13.191 --> 07:14.917
The Germans bury
them at night.

07:14.951 --> 07:16.297
Well, them white
boys don't like that

07:16.332 --> 07:19.335
finding them at night stuff.

07:19.369 --> 07:20.992
Dammit, Salty, if
the mines don't kill,

07:21.026 --> 07:22.303
us your driving will.

07:22.338 --> 07:23.822
You just let me worry
about the driving.

07:23.857 --> 07:25.237
Salty, that's exactly what
I'm worried about because you

07:25.272 --> 07:26.791
can't drive worth a damn.

07:26.825 --> 07:28.586
Ain't my fault these roads
are hard as hell on the tranny.

07:28.620 --> 07:29.241
On the tranny.

07:29.276 --> 07:30.173
Yeah, right.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.141
Just keep it
straight and true.

07:32.175 --> 07:33.694
I always do, Lieutenant.

07:40.632 --> 07:42.392
We figure this is
the last minefield

07:42.427 --> 07:44.567
we're going to have to clear
before we push in to Bellecour?

07:44.602 --> 07:46.845
Well, the army don't
like losing tanks.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.260
Yeah.

07:48.295 --> 07:49.917
Best send in the
dark-skinned brothers.

07:49.952 --> 07:51.332
They don't mind losing us.

07:51.367 --> 07:53.818
Crackers in the
back of the bus this time.

07:53.852 --> 07:55.440
Ain't no fare you want to ride.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.028
It's what we're
trained to do, gentlemen.

07:57.062 --> 07:58.926
I'm just glad
we're in the fight.

07:58.961 --> 08:00.031
Hell yeah?

08:00.065 --> 08:01.239
Hell yeah.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.137
And Lord, bless
this Jeep and get us

08:03.172 --> 08:04.760
safely through this minefield.

08:04.794 --> 08:06.865
Help us strike down our
enemy who strives to vanquish

08:06.900 --> 08:09.109
our divine mission to
restore peace and prosperity

08:09.143 --> 08:10.628
in your mighty Kingdom.

08:10.662 --> 08:11.283
Amen.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.806
And Lord, please provide
a safe passage and salvation

08:16.841 --> 08:18.567
from Salty's driving, amen.

08:18.601 --> 08:19.637
Amen.

08:19.671 --> 08:21.190
I don't think that's
how the Lord works.

08:21.224 --> 08:22.398
Well, he's supposed to
work in mysterious ways.

08:22.432 --> 08:23.054
Yeah.

08:23.779 --> 08:24.504
Funny.

08:50.046 --> 08:51.185
You guys wait here.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.960
Hey, sir, can I help you?

09:06.994 --> 09:09.100
Yes, Lieutenant.

09:09.134 --> 09:11.274
You're late.

09:11.309 --> 09:12.655
Sorry, sir.

09:12.690 --> 09:16.625
This mine needs
to be disposed.

09:16.659 --> 09:17.936
Yes, sir.

09:17.971 --> 09:19.006
That's my job.

09:19.041 --> 09:21.353
Oh, I know it is.

09:21.388 --> 09:23.873
Do you think I know it?

09:23.908 --> 09:25.841
Yes, sir.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.291
We'll take care of it.

09:28.326 --> 09:31.087
Have you swept and cleared
this area for any enemy?

09:31.122 --> 09:33.573
Of course we have, yup.

09:33.607 --> 09:37.197
Don't you think we'd be
here if it wasn't clear?

09:37.231 --> 09:38.578
I would hope so.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.131
Just get this
cleared, Lieutenant,

09:40.165 --> 09:41.995
and then we can get moving.

09:42.029 --> 09:42.858
You're holding us up.

09:45.343 --> 09:47.103
Are we clear?

09:47.138 --> 09:48.726
Crystal, sir.

10:05.087 --> 10:05.812
Help.

10:18.756 --> 10:20.930
Faster.

10:20.965 --> 10:21.897
We'll blitz them now.

10:21.931 --> 10:22.691
You understand?

10:22.725 --> 10:23.726
It's the only thing we have.

10:23.761 --> 10:25.383
Go.

10:55.102 --> 10:57.795
Yo, them white boys
don't be looking too happy.

10:57.829 --> 11:01.212
When we around, white
folks ain't ever happy.

11:01.246 --> 11:02.765
That's true.

11:02.800 --> 11:03.490
That's true.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.119
Found it.

11:12.154 --> 11:13.258
It's a teller mine.

11:13.293 --> 11:14.328
Mark it and blow.

11:14.363 --> 11:16.227
Oh, we're going to blow it.

11:16.261 --> 11:17.021
Salty.

11:17.055 --> 11:18.401
Sir?

11:18.436 --> 11:19.437
One pound of HG.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.369
Sir.

11:24.718 --> 11:25.961
Fire!

11:42.494 --> 11:43.737
If they hit those
mines, then he's gone.

11:43.772 --> 11:45.532
They hit that
mine, we all gone.

11:49.191 --> 11:52.021
Hey, get him.

11:52.056 --> 11:53.126
Don't be stupid.

12:01.099 --> 12:02.100
And fire!

12:07.105 --> 12:08.693
We've got to help him.

12:16.459 --> 12:17.633
We're going to attack.

12:17.667 --> 12:20.498
We're going to attack?

12:20.532 --> 12:22.431
Thank god he knows
what he's doing.

12:25.123 --> 12:26.297
Go, go.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.429
We've got to help him.

13:30.464 --> 13:31.914
Cover me.

13:31.949 --> 13:33.882
Got it.

13:33.916 --> 13:34.779
On me.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.469
Yeah.

13:43.029 --> 13:44.340
We will deploy.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.204
You will cover us on the spot.

13:46.239 --> 13:47.240
Sir.

13:47.274 --> 13:49.380
There will be no surrender.

13:49.414 --> 13:50.588
You understand?

14:46.713 --> 14:47.576
Everything OK, sir?

14:47.610 --> 14:48.577
Yeah.

14:48.611 --> 14:50.061
Hell yeah?

14:50.096 --> 14:50.786
Hell yeah.

15:00.451 --> 15:02.039
What's that round?

15:02.073 --> 15:03.316
Bazooka.

15:03.350 --> 15:05.525
Ellison.

15:05.559 --> 15:06.698
Army men.

15:11.255 --> 15:13.360
We're going to clear down the
trench in the firing line.

15:13.395 --> 15:14.361
Understood?

15:14.396 --> 15:15.086
Yes, sir.

15:19.504 --> 15:21.161
Ready?

15:21.196 --> 15:22.991
On my mark.

15:23.025 --> 15:24.958
Hey, Ellie?

15:24.993 --> 15:26.339
Don't miss.

15:26.373 --> 15:31.206
3, 2, now.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.172
Over the top.

15:45.772 --> 15:50.121
Dozer, I want you to keep
firing and don't let up.

15:50.156 --> 15:51.260
Yes, sir.

15:51.295 --> 15:52.330
This is your signal.

16:11.798 --> 16:12.385
Fire!

16:44.451 --> 16:45.211
Hands up!

16:47.730 --> 16:50.768
I said, hands up!

16:50.802 --> 16:53.081
Get up on them.

16:53.115 --> 16:54.082
Both hands.

16:54.116 --> 16:55.842
Let me see them, right now.

17:32.879 --> 17:34.363
What is this?

17:34.398 --> 17:35.882
This look like goose shit.

17:35.916 --> 17:36.848
I can't eat this.

17:36.883 --> 17:37.884
You don't even want this.

17:37.918 --> 17:39.782
I ain't seen you eat all day.

17:39.817 --> 17:40.680
You ain't nothing else?

17:40.714 --> 17:41.922
You got something else.

17:41.957 --> 17:42.923
That's even worse.
Stop it.

17:42.958 --> 17:43.890
Stop.

17:43.924 --> 17:44.649
Y'all shut up.

17:44.684 --> 17:45.650
Y'all shut up.

17:45.685 --> 17:48.239
You got to eat.

17:48.274 --> 17:49.585
Nasty anyway.

17:49.620 --> 17:50.897
No worse than your mama makes.

18:37.978 --> 18:39.773
Did what I could,
found some real eggs.

18:53.373 --> 18:54.202
You did right.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.037
But sometimes when you're
right, you're wrong.

19:02.071 --> 19:03.832
And when they're
wrong, they're right.

19:09.838 --> 19:11.011
We've got no control over it.

19:11.046 --> 19:13.635
I figure the best
we could do is not

19:13.669 --> 19:16.569
fear it, keep moving forward.

19:19.192 --> 19:22.506
The rest of the cards, they
have to fall where they fall.

19:25.198 --> 19:28.581
You have a way to fight a war.

19:28.615 --> 19:29.478
Hell of a way.

19:35.691 --> 19:37.900
Real eggs, huh?

19:37.935 --> 19:39.039
Stole them myself.

20:00.371 --> 20:01.959
These are real
eggs, all right.

20:01.993 --> 20:02.718
Hell yeah.

20:10.692 --> 20:15.938
I put your name forward for
your battlefield commission.

20:15.973 --> 20:17.871
Why is that?

20:17.906 --> 20:20.805
Because the army needs
good Black officers.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.773
But me?

20:22.807 --> 20:23.636
That's right, Red.

20:29.089 --> 20:31.885
Does that mean I'd have to
leave the-- leave the men?

20:31.920 --> 20:33.301
There is a probability.

20:37.650 --> 20:39.272
Thank you.

20:39.307 --> 20:45.451
Look, you don't have to accept
it, but you do deserve it.

20:45.485 --> 20:46.555
Think about it.

20:51.974 --> 20:53.493
In the army, we
salute officers.

20:58.222 --> 21:00.362
I don't believe you
heard the Lieutenant.

21:03.123 --> 21:05.125
We don't salute Negroes.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.231
We don't salute the
color of a man's skin.

21:09.544 --> 21:11.546
You'll either
salute the Lieutenant

21:11.580 --> 21:13.341
or pick your teeth
up off the ground.

21:33.706 --> 21:35.363
Now, was that so hard?

21:38.642 --> 21:39.988
What are you all looking at?

21:40.022 --> 21:42.991
Get back to work!

21:54.382 --> 21:54.796
Lieutenant.

21:54.830 --> 21:55.693
Sergeant.

21:55.728 --> 21:56.384
Sir.

22:00.353 --> 22:04.012
Well, I'm up to my elbows in
logistics for a push into Metz,

22:04.046 --> 22:05.496
and all the division
seems to care

22:05.531 --> 22:07.256
about is putting together
a damn search party

22:07.291 --> 22:09.086
for some crashed fighter pilot.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.363
Can you believe that?

22:10.398 --> 22:11.433
No, sir.

22:11.468 --> 22:12.779
So I'm hoping you
have the scouting report

22:12.814 --> 22:13.677
on the blue sector.

22:13.711 --> 22:15.989
Yes, sir.

22:16.024 --> 22:18.475
Zone blue is clear.

22:18.509 --> 22:21.132
We double our push
from green into blue,

22:21.167 --> 22:25.102
we can clear those mines
without any issue, sir.

22:27.449 --> 22:29.831
Protect Metz from the northeast?

22:29.865 --> 22:31.626
It's the best route, sir.

22:31.660 --> 22:32.351
It's all here.

22:38.943 --> 22:40.945
You're one of my
best, Lieutenant.

22:40.980 --> 22:42.844
Thank you, sir.

22:42.878 --> 22:45.812
So I heard
you had trouble up there.

22:45.847 --> 22:47.883
The Germans sprung
an ambush on us.

22:47.918 --> 22:49.471
Thick?

22:49.506 --> 22:52.923
Tanks, AT guns, machine guns,
and mortars, 50 to 60 men.

22:52.957 --> 22:54.614
We cleared the sector.

22:54.649 --> 22:56.858
Good.

22:56.892 --> 22:58.342
Well, I meant to
address both of you

22:58.377 --> 22:59.619
up front about a few things.

23:03.485 --> 23:07.800
Well, I received the
paperwork for your battlefield

23:07.834 --> 23:09.146
commission.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.596
Congratulations, Sergeant.

23:10.630 --> 23:11.735
Thank you, sir.

23:11.769 --> 23:13.564
Well, I don't know what
the army's going to say.

23:13.599 --> 23:16.843
It's not very common for them to
approve a commission like that.

23:16.878 --> 23:18.155
I understand, sir.

23:18.189 --> 23:19.984
But I forwarded the
paperwork up to division

23:20.019 --> 23:22.228
with my recommendation.

23:22.262 --> 23:24.195
You certainly deserve it.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.783
Thank you, sir.

23:25.818 --> 23:30.270
Now, I'm going to have to be
straight with you, Lieutenant.

23:30.305 --> 23:32.238
Division has
reassigned you pending

23:32.272 --> 23:34.171
an investigation
into your conduct

23:34.205 --> 23:35.828
during yesterday's mission.

23:35.862 --> 23:37.208
Investigation?

23:37.243 --> 23:38.796
Well, someone's
trying to pin the blame

23:38.831 --> 23:41.074
for that German ambush on you.

23:41.109 --> 23:45.044
But, sir, that ain't at all.

23:45.078 --> 23:46.528
It was them crack--

23:46.563 --> 23:48.944
it was them white soldiers
that didn't do their job.

23:48.979 --> 23:50.532
They didn't clear the sector.

23:50.567 --> 23:54.087
Major Anderson, with all due
respect, sir, I did my job.

23:54.122 --> 23:55.744
Sir, this just ain't right.

23:55.779 --> 23:56.918
Look.

23:56.952 --> 23:59.127
I know we're snowed.

23:59.161 --> 24:00.991
You give me three
or four days, I'll

24:01.025 --> 24:03.200
have these charges dismissed.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.996
What about my men, sir?

24:06.030 --> 24:07.100
Well, Red here
will have a chance

24:07.135 --> 24:10.000
to show an officer he can be.

24:10.034 --> 24:11.139
But--

24:11.173 --> 24:15.315
I don't like it either,
but it's the best I can do.

24:15.350 --> 24:16.834
Where do I report, sir?

24:16.869 --> 24:19.388
Report to command post eight
on the other side of camp.

24:19.423 --> 24:22.253
They'll take you back to
division for reassignment.

24:29.398 --> 24:31.573
Look, we'll fight
this, and we'll win.

24:31.608 --> 24:33.126
Keep your head up, Lieutenant.

24:33.161 --> 24:33.886
Yes, sir.

24:44.172 --> 24:47.002
I'm sorry about that, sir.

24:47.037 --> 24:50.247
Hey, don't even
worry about it.

24:50.281 --> 24:52.249
I need you to take
care of the men.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.803
They're just as much
yours as they are mine.

24:56.253 --> 24:58.842
I'll fill you in
when I get back.

24:58.876 --> 24:59.739
All right?

24:59.774 --> 25:00.360
All right.

25:00.395 --> 25:01.430
All right.

25:01.465 --> 25:02.086
Good luck.
Take care.

25:02.121 --> 25:02.777
Thanks.

25:32.185 --> 25:34.774
Nice to see you
again, Lieutenant.

25:37.121 --> 25:38.502
You just don't learn, do you?

25:38.537 --> 25:42.506
What they hell do think
you're doing, Lieutenant.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.301
Sir, it's not
what it looks like.

25:44.335 --> 25:48.305
Do you understand
English, Lieutenant?

25:48.339 --> 25:50.687
Yes, I do, sir.

25:50.721 --> 25:51.860
That's better.

25:51.895 --> 25:54.587
That's the one, Captain.

25:54.622 --> 25:56.520
This is the one
that's been giving

25:56.555 --> 25:58.108
you boys all this trouble?

25:58.142 --> 25:59.109
Sir, it is not--

25:59.143 --> 26:02.319
Did I ask you, Lieutenant?

26:05.218 --> 26:06.565
Now, the army may have
given you that rank,

26:06.599 --> 26:10.499
but that don't mean
shit to me or my boys.

26:10.534 --> 26:14.158
So that's your
place, in the back.

26:14.193 --> 26:14.918
Enjoy it.

26:19.957 --> 26:21.683
Yes, sir.

26:38.631 --> 26:39.425
Mount up!

27:10.387 --> 27:14.667
Red, I've seen
that face before.

27:14.702 --> 27:18.222
Where the army
got us going next?

27:18.257 --> 27:20.017
Everybody, listen up.

27:20.052 --> 27:20.846
Listen up.

27:26.714 --> 27:28.163
There's no right
way to say this,

27:28.198 --> 27:30.441
so I'm just going to say it.

27:30.476 --> 27:32.064
Lieutenant Hayes
has been temporarily

27:32.098 --> 27:33.582
reassigned to division.

27:33.617 --> 27:34.031
What?

27:34.066 --> 27:35.343
What?

27:35.377 --> 27:37.034
I said temporarily.

27:37.069 --> 27:39.105
For what?

27:39.140 --> 27:42.315
Pending an investigation.

27:42.350 --> 27:44.007
Now, look.

27:44.041 --> 27:46.699
Now, Hayes can handle himself.

27:46.734 --> 27:49.288
Before long, he'll--
he'll be back.

27:49.322 --> 27:52.084
Until then, we're not going to
disappoint him when he returns,

27:52.118 --> 27:52.947
are we?

27:52.981 --> 27:53.913
No, Sergeant.

27:53.948 --> 27:55.121
All right.

27:55.156 --> 27:56.813
Now, I want those field
radios cleaned and working

27:56.847 --> 27:57.537
by the end of the day.

27:57.572 --> 27:58.331
Understand?

27:58.366 --> 27:59.160
Yes, Sergeant.

27:59.194 --> 28:00.092
Make a hole.

28:03.095 --> 28:04.199
You boys heard the sergeant.

28:04.234 --> 28:05.442
Let's get back to work.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.271
Sit down.

28:07.306 --> 28:08.065
No, I'm serious.

28:28.983 --> 28:30.156
Damn it.

28:30.191 --> 28:32.296
How's it going?

28:32.331 --> 28:33.815
Something's not right.

28:33.850 --> 28:35.921
We should have hit
division a long time ago.

28:49.451 --> 28:51.281
Hey, gents.

28:51.315 --> 28:53.766
Son of a bitch.

28:53.801 --> 28:56.010
I'm familiar with the area.

28:56.044 --> 28:57.666
If you want, I can help.

28:57.701 --> 29:00.255
And get us all killed
like those other soldiers

29:00.290 --> 29:03.534
you tried to help?

29:03.569 --> 29:04.881
Not on my watch.

29:09.230 --> 29:10.472
Get on the radio.

29:10.507 --> 29:11.991
Find out where the hell we are.

29:43.229 --> 29:45.197
This
is Mike Devine from UN.

29:45.231 --> 29:46.681
Here.

29:46.715 --> 29:48.338
We believe
we are at sector 17B,

29:48.372 --> 29:50.685
pushing our way to division.

29:50.719 --> 29:52.169
Our current location
we believe to be

29:52.204 --> 29:58.072
52 degrees north latitude,
19 degrees east longitude.

29:58.106 --> 29:59.245
Americans.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.903
MAN: I
repeat, 52 north, 19 east.

30:05.320 --> 30:09.531
Americans,
the half tracks.

30:31.691 --> 30:32.934
What's going on?

30:32.969 --> 30:33.590
Shut up!

30:33.624 --> 30:34.798
We're working.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.041
What?

30:36.075 --> 30:38.043
I said, shut up--

30:38.077 --> 30:39.044
sorry, Sarge.

30:39.078 --> 30:40.010
I ain't know it was you.

30:40.045 --> 30:41.874
Look, I can't find
a frequency if you

30:41.909 --> 30:43.738
all keep flapping your lips.

30:43.772 --> 30:45.395
What the hell is going on?

30:45.429 --> 30:47.431
Well, you said that Hayes
is being reassigned, right?

30:47.466 --> 30:49.019
Yeah.

30:49.054 --> 30:50.607
Well, Salty got his hands
on some radio frequency codes.

30:50.641 --> 30:52.747
It sounds like your boy is
in some sort of trouble.

30:52.781 --> 30:55.612
They got lost
behind the lines.

30:55.646 --> 30:56.509
Give me that.

31:40.657 --> 31:41.589
God damn it.

31:41.623 --> 31:42.486
Get back to your vehicle.

31:42.521 --> 31:43.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:43.556 --> 31:45.489
You don't hear that?

32:07.615 --> 32:08.581
Red one, red one.

32:08.616 --> 32:09.997
This is Charlie 49er.

32:10.031 --> 32:11.550
I repeat, this is Charlie 49er.

32:11.584 --> 32:12.896
We're under attack.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.311
We're going back into the woods.

32:14.346 --> 32:16.175
I repeat, we are going
back into the woods.

32:16.210 --> 32:16.624
Stop.

32:16.658 --> 32:17.625
Stop.

32:17.659 --> 32:18.488
You'll reveal the location.

32:21.663 --> 32:22.664
Get him back, Salty.

33:09.677 --> 33:10.609
Fire!

33:18.582 --> 33:19.238
Major.

33:22.034 --> 33:24.278
Sergeant.

33:24.312 --> 33:25.313
Sir.

33:25.348 --> 33:26.383
You heard about the ambush.

33:26.418 --> 33:28.765
Sir, we got to go rescue them.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.801
We can't be sure anyone
made it out of that.

33:30.836 --> 33:33.632
But sir, if there's a
possibility he might be alive,

33:33.666 --> 33:34.840
we-- we got to go get him.

33:34.874 --> 33:36.531
I don't have the
authority to send out

33:36.566 --> 33:37.739
a rescue party at this time.

33:37.774 --> 33:40.087
But sir, it would
just take-- just--

33:40.121 --> 33:43.400
We cannot go charging off
on some rescue operation.

33:43.435 --> 33:45.506
We've got a city to
take and a war to win.

33:45.540 --> 33:46.507
But, sir--

33:46.541 --> 33:47.646
There's nothing I can do.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.165
Hayes is a smart man.

33:49.199 --> 33:51.788
If he's still alive, he'll
find a way to make it back.

33:51.822 --> 33:53.721
But we have no way of--

33:56.413 --> 33:57.069
sir.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.745
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:17.779 --> 34:20.575
Easy, Lieutenant.

34:20.610 --> 34:22.198
Think about it.

34:22.232 --> 34:24.303
Get over here.

34:24.338 --> 34:25.718
Come on.

34:59.269 --> 35:00.546
Get down!

35:00.581 --> 35:01.237
Shh.

35:07.243 --> 35:08.071
Follow me.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.330
I don't see any more Germans.

35:25.364 --> 35:27.849
Good.

35:27.884 --> 35:30.956
You're lucky I was around.

35:30.990 --> 35:33.614
I was doing just fine.

35:33.648 --> 35:35.823
You a pilot?

35:35.857 --> 35:37.238
Yeah.

35:37.273 --> 35:42.001
Well, I was until
I was shot down.

35:42.036 --> 35:45.004
Maybe I'm the one
that's rescuing you.

35:45.039 --> 35:46.972
Hey, I was doing
just fine until you

35:47.006 --> 35:50.493
brought the whole damn German
army right on top of me.

35:50.527 --> 35:52.150
Welcome to the war.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.668
Will you just
get on your radio

35:53.703 --> 35:55.118
and call in reinforcements?

35:57.534 --> 35:59.640
Are all you pilots this dumb?

35:59.674 --> 36:01.089
This is a ham radio.

36:01.124 --> 36:03.091
We don't have near enough
range to make contact.

36:03.126 --> 36:05.473
And even if we did, we have
half the German army between us,

36:05.508 --> 36:06.164
remember?

36:11.376 --> 36:13.378
What are you doing?

36:13.412 --> 36:14.758
Hey.

36:14.793 --> 36:16.760
Stay down.

36:16.795 --> 36:19.107
Ooh.

36:19.142 --> 36:21.834
Where are you going?

36:21.869 --> 36:23.905
There still are
Germans out there.

36:26.874 --> 36:27.530
Hey.

36:34.847 --> 36:36.987
Listen up, listen up.

36:40.715 --> 36:45.099
Now, the major told me there's
nothing we can do for Hayes.

36:46.583 --> 36:47.412
Come on, man.

36:47.446 --> 36:48.102
Hell no.

36:54.384 --> 36:54.902
Listen.

36:54.936 --> 36:55.592
Hold on.

36:55.627 --> 36:56.835
Hold on.

36:56.869 --> 36:58.250
We can't leave him
out there, Sarge.

36:58.285 --> 36:58.906
Right.

36:58.940 --> 36:59.976
Hayes is alive.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.357
That's right.

37:01.391 --> 37:03.600
We just don't have
the orders, they say.

37:05.982 --> 37:07.190
We've got to go.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.054
We can't leave him
stranded like that.

37:09.088 --> 37:12.160
But you know what I say?

37:12.195 --> 37:14.956
I say, to hell with orders.

37:14.991 --> 37:17.407
Yeah.

37:17.442 --> 37:19.513
We're going to find
Hayes and bring him back.

37:25.484 --> 37:27.624
Shh, shh.

37:27.659 --> 37:30.386
Now, does anybody have
any ideas for a plan?

37:34.700 --> 37:35.632
Anybody else?

37:41.189 --> 37:43.916
Salty, why are we at the PX?

37:43.951 --> 37:45.193
Trust me.

37:45.228 --> 37:46.850
Old Thomas will help us.

37:46.885 --> 37:49.405
You mean the mail sergeant?

37:49.439 --> 37:50.544
Come on, man.

37:50.578 --> 37:52.753
Let's go.

37:52.787 --> 37:53.443
Thomas.

37:56.481 --> 37:57.275
You got my money?

38:00.243 --> 38:01.002
Me?

38:01.037 --> 38:02.487
I owe you money?

38:02.521 --> 38:04.420
Man, give me my money.

38:04.454 --> 38:07.146
You be your own
people, your own people.

38:10.046 --> 38:12.566
Don't stop.

38:12.600 --> 38:13.360
That was it.

38:13.394 --> 38:14.050
Interest.

38:17.467 --> 38:21.678
You take your little
$7, then you stupid--

38:21.713 --> 38:22.852
All of it.

38:22.886 --> 38:24.302
You ain't gonna
leave me no money.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.269
You're lucky it's not more.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.996
You-- you're just going
to count it in my face?

38:29.030 --> 38:31.654
So let me just
get a dollar back.

38:31.688 --> 38:34.760
Pleasure doing business.

38:34.795 --> 38:36.693
Salty, not him.

38:36.728 --> 38:37.625
Let's go.

38:37.660 --> 38:38.730
We'll find another way.

38:38.764 --> 38:41.802
I heard about Hayes.

38:41.836 --> 38:43.528
What a loss.

38:43.562 --> 38:44.667
He was a damn good man.

38:48.395 --> 38:49.637
What do you know about Hayes?

38:52.191 --> 38:54.159
Look around you, son.

38:54.193 --> 38:55.712
I own the news around here.

38:55.747 --> 38:58.301
Well look, Thomas, look,
that's why we're here.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.682
We think Hayes is alive.

38:59.716 --> 39:01.891
We want to go out and find
him and bring him back.

39:01.925 --> 39:03.410
Now, can you help us out?

39:03.444 --> 39:04.963
Depends.

39:04.997 --> 39:07.655
What constitutes help?

39:07.690 --> 39:11.452
We need fuel, gear, and ammo,
enough for two or three days.

39:11.487 --> 39:15.456
Gear and ammo
for two or three days?

39:15.491 --> 39:18.632
That's-- that's a lot of
supplies on short notice,

39:18.666 --> 39:21.013
gentlemen, with no
acquisition orders?

39:21.048 --> 39:22.567
Salty, let's go.

39:22.601 --> 39:23.395
Not this guy.

39:23.430 --> 39:24.569
Let's go.

39:24.603 --> 39:29.090
Sounds like you boys
can use some tank support.

39:29.125 --> 39:30.609
Who is this?

39:30.644 --> 39:34.544
Sergeant Warren
Creasy, first squad.

39:34.579 --> 39:36.995
Yeah, I let him sleep off his
hangovers up there sometimes.

39:37.029 --> 39:41.102
Pays me good.

39:41.137 --> 39:42.449
Now, why would you help us?

39:42.483 --> 39:44.382
You're trying to
kill crouch, right?

39:44.416 --> 39:47.350
But we don't exactly have
orders for such a mission.

39:47.385 --> 39:51.078
I've never been too
fond of taking orders.

39:51.112 --> 39:52.044
Clearly.

39:52.079 --> 39:52.735
Hey, hey.

39:55.254 --> 39:58.223
I know what it looks
like, man, but--

39:58.257 --> 39:59.086
and we need that.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.052
We do.

40:02.952 --> 40:04.402
Suppose you show
us these tanks.

40:16.068 --> 40:17.587
Light tanks?

40:17.622 --> 40:21.729
I don't like the
size of them for you.

40:21.764 --> 40:25.319
Girls can go pound
for pound, take out

40:25.353 --> 40:28.426
any front line in a firefight.

40:28.460 --> 40:32.430
This is California
Love, Blood and Guts.

40:34.949 --> 40:39.022
That's my baby
right there, Alamo.

40:39.057 --> 40:40.610
Oh, I like her.

40:40.645 --> 40:44.372
These are real men out here,
real men that have put it

40:44.407 --> 40:46.858
all on the line, real killers.

40:46.892 --> 40:48.929
They look pretty green to me.

40:48.963 --> 40:51.828
Two years in the
Georgia swamps,

40:51.863 --> 40:57.627
six months in the blistering hot
sun of Texas, training for war.

40:57.662 --> 41:01.320
Almost nine months
training for Germans.

41:01.355 --> 41:03.426
Looks are deceiving.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.600
OK.

41:04.634 --> 41:05.324
Follow me.

41:16.025 --> 41:19.684
500 gallons of gasoline?

41:19.718 --> 41:21.064
Who made that order?

41:21.099 --> 41:22.203
Yes, who?

41:24.896 --> 41:26.553
Well, you hold on to
that order till I find

41:26.587 --> 41:28.693
out what the hell is going on.

41:28.727 --> 41:31.143
Right.

41:31.178 --> 41:33.042
Yeah, we heard about
Lieutenant Hayes.

41:33.076 --> 41:34.526
Shame.

41:34.561 --> 41:35.493
I saw Red.

41:35.527 --> 41:36.908
He wasn't too happy
about it either.

41:36.942 --> 41:37.667
None of us are.

41:41.706 --> 41:42.707
Anything else?

41:42.741 --> 41:44.571
Sir, you know about
that missing pilot

41:44.605 --> 41:46.711
that division's
been asking about?

41:49.334 --> 41:52.026
Well, they say he shot
down a German jet plane,

41:52.061 --> 41:53.407
one of Germany's new weapons.

41:53.441 --> 41:55.720
They say that pilot
landed in the same sector

41:55.754 --> 41:57.445
that Lieutenant Hayes
went missing in.

42:00.414 --> 42:03.797
Division would like
this pilot found.

42:03.831 --> 42:06.282
Put together a search
party, Hayes could be found.

42:06.316 --> 42:08.249
Well, division
would be pleased, sir.

42:08.284 --> 42:09.975
But there's no way
division is going to improve

42:10.010 --> 42:13.151
redirecting our field
artillery when our-- our push

42:13.185 --> 42:15.256
is 36 hours away.

42:18.708 --> 42:22.056
Oh, sir, I forgot
to tell you that um--

42:22.091 --> 42:25.508
well, General Patton just
confirmed his arrival for troop

42:25.543 --> 42:28.235
review before pushing to Metz.

42:28.269 --> 42:30.168
Didn't you serve
with him in Africa?

42:30.202 --> 42:31.549
I did.

42:31.583 --> 42:32.342
Huh.

42:32.377 --> 42:33.999
Yeah, that's what I thought.

42:34.034 --> 42:37.451
A damn fine man.

42:37.485 --> 42:39.971
Well, thank you, Sergeant.

42:40.005 --> 42:41.420
You've been very helpful.

42:41.455 --> 42:42.870
Sir, keep the pen.

42:46.425 --> 42:48.427
Smith?

42:48.462 --> 42:50.533
Give me a line to
the third army.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.742
I'm on it, sir.

42:52.777 --> 42:53.985
Someone get my Jeep.

42:58.161 --> 43:00.267
You're making noise.

43:00.301 --> 43:01.406
I'm not trying to.

43:01.440 --> 43:04.340
Just avoid
the thick stuff.

43:04.374 --> 43:06.549
You've never been
in the woods before?

43:06.584 --> 43:07.377
Sure.

43:07.412 --> 43:09.103
Central Park.

43:09.138 --> 43:10.657
Central Park?

43:10.691 --> 43:11.934
In New York?

43:11.968 --> 43:13.211
Yeah.

43:13.245 --> 43:14.799
It's not the same
thing, city boy.

43:19.010 --> 43:20.598
Where are we even going?

43:20.632 --> 43:24.084
Random mill, up the road.

43:24.118 --> 43:25.119
Well, are we close yet?

43:25.154 --> 43:26.569
No, we're not close.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.191
We're a long way from
the line, and we're

43:28.226 --> 43:31.125
a long way from New York.

43:31.160 --> 43:32.540
Are all you like that?

43:37.442 --> 43:38.029
Who?

43:38.063 --> 43:40.031
Blacks?

43:40.065 --> 43:41.411
No.

43:41.446 --> 43:43.379
I meant ground pounders,
leg boys like yourself.

43:47.417 --> 43:49.972
Goodbye, city
boy, and good luck.

43:50.006 --> 43:54.804
I'm leaving your dumb ass
before you get me killed.

43:54.839 --> 43:57.048
Hey, get back here.

43:57.082 --> 43:57.842
That's an order.

44:02.260 --> 44:02.950
An order?

44:05.573 --> 44:08.818
I follow orders to
ensure mission success.

44:08.853 --> 44:11.441
Hell, I'll follow
orders to save a life.

44:11.476 --> 44:14.410
But what I won't do is
follow orders that will

44:14.444 --> 44:16.377
willfully getting me killed.

44:16.412 --> 44:18.621
I'm not trying
to get you killed.

44:21.382 --> 44:24.489
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

44:24.523 --> 44:26.664
And don't follow me.

44:39.953 --> 44:40.919
All right.

44:40.954 --> 44:42.334
Giddy up, god damn it.

44:42.369 --> 44:45.096
Major Anderson,
the 761st battalion.

44:45.130 --> 44:46.166
I need to speak to the general.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.546
Come on, men.

44:47.581 --> 44:50.515
Hitler's waiting for us.

44:50.549 --> 44:52.137
We've got all day.

44:52.172 --> 44:53.932
I'm going to need you
to stop right there, sir.

44:53.967 --> 44:57.487
I've seen old
whores move faster than that.

44:57.522 --> 45:01.043
General, sir.

45:01.077 --> 45:02.492
You lost, son?

45:02.527 --> 45:06.220
Major Anderson,
sir, 761st battalion.

45:06.255 --> 45:11.881
Ah, I expect a lot from
those Black tankers, Major.

45:11.916 --> 45:14.573
I served under
you, sir, Gershwin

45:14.608 --> 45:17.749
Pass, command B, first armored.

45:17.784 --> 45:21.580
My boys took on a
minefields, 15th Panzer, sir.

45:21.615 --> 45:23.203
Licked them good.

45:23.237 --> 45:25.964
Anderson.

45:25.999 --> 45:27.552
Yeah.

45:27.586 --> 45:30.555
Hell of a fine job you did
with those boys in Athens.

45:30.589 --> 45:32.005
Damn good job.

45:32.039 --> 45:33.523
Fine work, fine work.

45:33.558 --> 45:36.181
Those Black tankers are
damn proud to have you.

45:36.216 --> 45:37.113
Thank you, sir.

45:37.148 --> 45:38.459
I have a request, sir.

45:38.494 --> 45:40.461
I'd like to redirect the
division of artillery

45:40.496 --> 45:44.776
this evening, grid section 843.

45:44.811 --> 45:46.433
Sure, sure.

45:46.467 --> 45:49.677
Anything for a regular
Stonewall Jackson.

45:49.712 --> 45:53.267
I am counting on you and your
boys to get us into Metz.

45:53.302 --> 45:54.682
Don't let me down.

45:54.717 --> 45:55.407
No, sir.

45:57.858 --> 46:00.516
Thank you, sir.

46:00.550 --> 46:01.413
All right.

46:01.448 --> 46:02.311
Giddy up, god damn it.

46:02.345 --> 46:03.105
Let's go.

46:05.279 --> 46:06.142
Load them up, boys.

46:06.177 --> 46:07.903
Let's move them out.

46:07.937 --> 46:08.593
Here we go.

46:11.216 --> 46:13.080
Hayes' last known position.

46:13.115 --> 46:15.738
Now, I suggest we
take Fagan Roadway,

46:15.773 --> 46:17.636
send your tanks
down this rail line

46:17.671 --> 46:21.571
here, convene at this juncture.

46:21.606 --> 46:25.299
That rail line
should be just fine.

46:25.334 --> 46:26.507
What about the Germans?

46:26.542 --> 46:27.923
We leave at night.

46:27.957 --> 46:29.890
Artillery might
help confuse them.

46:29.925 --> 46:32.548
Those snatch-and-grab
stewards provide service

46:32.582 --> 46:35.206
to protect us from the Krauts.

46:35.240 --> 46:38.623
Tonight, zero 100 departure.

46:38.657 --> 46:41.177
Don't be late.

46:41.212 --> 46:42.765
Mail's always on time, son.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.526
So how much is this
favor going to cost us?

46:50.600 --> 46:52.188
I'll decide that if
you all make it back.

46:54.777 --> 46:58.022
Make sure you're there.

46:58.056 --> 47:00.610
You can count on it.

47:00.645 --> 47:03.130
Gentlemen, don't fuck this up.

47:14.038 --> 47:17.213
Come on.

47:17.248 --> 47:17.938
Stupid flies.

47:21.079 --> 47:23.875
Stop!

47:23.910 --> 47:27.361
Don't move.

47:27.396 --> 47:29.536
You're in a minefield.

47:29.570 --> 47:30.640
Shit.

47:30.675 --> 47:31.883
What do I do?

47:31.918 --> 47:34.852
Put your foot back
into your last step.

47:34.886 --> 47:36.336
Breathe.

47:36.370 --> 47:39.063
Stay calm.

47:39.097 --> 47:41.651
OK.

47:41.686 --> 47:43.170
What are you doing?

47:43.205 --> 47:46.829
I'm going to come out
and get you, clear a path,

47:46.864 --> 47:49.383
and bring you back to safety.

47:49.418 --> 47:51.592
But I can see them.

47:51.627 --> 47:54.526
Oh, that ain't all of them.

48:01.775 --> 48:03.811
I don't want to see
anyone here slacking.

48:03.846 --> 48:04.364
Come on.

48:04.398 --> 48:05.744
Move, gentlemen.

48:08.506 --> 48:10.197
Sergeant.

48:10.232 --> 48:12.061
Major.

48:12.096 --> 48:13.476
Mail drop off, sir?

48:13.511 --> 48:16.238
It's a little late, but I hope
it can still find its way out.

48:19.862 --> 48:26.075
Make sure that's delivered
on time and on target.

48:26.110 --> 48:26.904
Yes, sir.

48:35.567 --> 48:36.914
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

48:46.268 --> 48:48.960
How's it coming?

48:48.995 --> 48:50.858
Looks like old Thomas
made good on his promise.

48:55.035 --> 48:55.863
Oh, shit.

49:00.523 --> 49:01.352
This don't look good.

49:08.531 --> 49:10.154
This mission is unauthorized.

49:10.188 --> 49:11.845
I can't let you leave.

49:11.879 --> 49:13.674
I'm ordering you
all to stand down.

49:13.709 --> 49:15.642
I'm afraid we
can't do that, sir.

49:24.892 --> 49:28.206
Listen, Red, if
you do this, there's

49:28.241 --> 49:30.691
no way in hell
divisions can improve

49:30.726 --> 49:32.038
your battlefield commission.

49:32.072 --> 49:35.179
If that's what it takes, sir.

49:35.213 --> 49:36.801
Don't you want
to be an officer?

49:36.835 --> 49:38.906
Sir, I'll trade all the
commendations in this army

49:38.941 --> 49:39.977
for Lieutenant Hayes.

49:43.601 --> 49:44.705
That's what I thought.

49:47.432 --> 49:52.058
You got 24 hours, courtesy
of General George Patton.

49:52.092 --> 49:52.713
I'm sorry, sir.

49:52.748 --> 49:53.887
I don't understand.

49:53.921 --> 49:55.095
Find Hayes and bring him back.

49:55.130 --> 49:57.615
If you find an American
pilot out there,

49:57.649 --> 50:01.446
bring him back as well.

50:01.481 --> 50:03.379
Don't let me down, Sergeant.

50:03.414 --> 50:04.173
Good luck.

50:04.208 --> 50:05.002
Thank you, sir.

50:09.282 --> 50:10.524
Well, I'll be damned.

50:10.559 --> 50:12.112
Line up.

50:22.502 --> 50:26.989
It's best to keep your
mind from thinking about it.

50:27.024 --> 50:29.474
OK.

50:29.509 --> 50:30.165
OK.

50:38.104 --> 50:40.761
We've got one more
thing there to my case.

50:45.663 --> 50:50.978
My wingman, I got him killed.

50:58.193 --> 51:00.781
I tried to take on this
new type of German plane.

51:03.405 --> 51:04.302
It was foolish, really.

51:08.237 --> 51:13.415
Mike, I should have
listened to you.

51:16.970 --> 51:19.248
Should have headed
back to police.

51:19.283 --> 51:20.836
He intercepted
that German plane,

51:20.870 --> 51:24.874
and .. he got shot

51:26.876 --> 51:27.877
and died.

51:51.177 --> 51:55.595
A friend of mine once
told me the best thing you

51:55.629 --> 52:00.565
can do in a war is to not fear.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.533
You just got to let the
cards fall where they fall.

52:06.330 --> 52:10.196
What happened to Mike,
it wasn't your fault.

52:17.272 --> 52:21.241
Now, just make sure to stay
on the path that I just made.

52:26.108 --> 52:27.937
It's this way, watch out.

52:44.851 --> 52:47.612
Next mile and a half,
we'll find the man,

52:47.647 --> 52:49.373
whatever it takes to stop.

53:09.393 --> 53:11.740
Hold it.

53:11.774 --> 53:13.949
Listen up.

53:13.983 --> 53:18.712
On my command, we're going
to make a 90-degree turn

53:18.747 --> 53:20.611
in the next few miles.

53:20.645 --> 53:23.200
On my command, copy?

53:26.651 --> 53:27.342
Let's go.

53:42.426 --> 53:43.012
Thomas.

53:43.047 --> 53:43.634
Hi.

53:46.913 --> 53:48.190
I said I would have the money.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.191
I'm going to have the money.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.088
You just have to realize--

53:50.123 --> 53:51.504
Just-- just shut up, OK?

53:51.538 --> 53:54.576
I need an artillery barrage
on grid section 473.

53:54.610 --> 53:56.578
Sure, no problem.

53:56.612 --> 53:57.406
Do you have a--

53:57.441 --> 53:58.407
Authorization.

54:05.932 --> 54:09.798
This is-- this is
not from division.

54:09.832 --> 54:11.075
General Patton.

54:11.109 --> 54:12.525
You want to call
the general yourself?

54:18.255 --> 54:19.670
Everything seems
to be in order.

54:19.704 --> 54:20.602
Yeah, I know.

54:20.636 --> 54:21.499
Everything is in order.

54:21.534 --> 54:22.983
Oh, and one last thing.

54:31.820 --> 54:33.028
I wonder how
that got in there.

54:33.062 --> 54:35.893
Yeah, I wonder too.

54:35.927 --> 54:38.654
Well, it's-- it's my money.

54:38.689 --> 54:40.553
Beautiful, beautiful.

54:40.587 --> 54:41.554
Ah, ah.

54:41.588 --> 54:43.383
You know what?

54:43.418 --> 54:44.108
Interest.

55:19.488 --> 55:21.732
Your lady?

55:21.766 --> 55:22.457
Yeah.

55:29.084 --> 55:30.430
Get to this war
and come back to me,

55:30.465 --> 55:32.950
was the last thing
she said to me.

55:32.984 --> 55:34.848
She's beautiful.

55:34.883 --> 55:35.539
Thanks, man.

55:38.576 --> 55:39.750
Lisa.

55:39.784 --> 55:43.201
She wanted to get married
before I shipped out.

55:43.236 --> 55:45.134
I wasn't sure if I'd
make it back home.

55:45.169 --> 55:47.861
You love her?

55:47.896 --> 55:50.347
Yeah, I do.

55:55.352 --> 56:01.841
I um should've never
left you back there.

56:02.393 --> 56:04.188
I'm sorry.

56:04.222 --> 56:05.948
What made you
come back for me?

56:05.983 --> 56:07.433
I guess I was
following orders.

56:11.989 --> 56:14.750
The name is Hayes, Robert Hayes.

56:14.785 --> 56:15.958
Frank Ross.

56:15.993 --> 56:17.891
Nice to meet you.

56:17.926 --> 56:20.480
Thanks for coming back.

56:32.906 --> 56:36.393
Looks like some sort of repair
station set up in the town

56:36.427 --> 56:37.463
below.

56:37.497 --> 56:40.327
They should be sitting ducks.

56:40.362 --> 56:43.538
We'll go in our
triangle formation, R,

56:43.572 --> 56:46.195
take Blood and go
down to the right.

56:46.230 --> 56:48.370
Yucky, you move Alamo
down to the left.

56:48.405 --> 56:50.165
California Love will center.

57:02.695 --> 57:05.076
Looking good, boys.

57:05.111 --> 57:07.596
Keep your eyes wide open.

57:07.631 --> 57:11.773
Any fucking second, those
Krauts could hit us.

57:28.962 --> 57:30.930
Direct
orders from General Patton.

57:30.964 --> 57:35.244
The artillery attack
at Fort at 1900.

57:35.279 --> 57:37.592
Yes sir, yes, sir.

57:37.626 --> 57:42.493
Fire mission, November, golf,
18, 18, fire for a fact.

57:50.846 --> 57:52.123
Hard left.

57:58.613 --> 58:00.615
Fire.

58:01.995 --> 58:03.583
Now!

58:08.001 --> 58:09.209
Hard right now.

58:12.005 --> 58:12.972
Fire!

58:19.910 --> 58:20.566
Fire.

58:27.365 --> 58:29.160
Row, aim deeper.

58:34.062 --> 58:35.166
Hard right now.

58:37.962 --> 58:38.929
Fire!

58:42.001 --> 58:42.933
Fire.

58:52.977 --> 58:54.531
That one was shot cold.

59:05.162 --> 59:06.508
Call up the shots.

59:20.591 --> 59:21.834
Hayes, we've got company.

59:27.529 --> 59:28.979
When did they get here?

59:29.013 --> 59:30.359
Just now.

59:30.394 --> 59:32.016
I don't think they know
we're in here, though.

59:32.051 --> 59:32.741
Time to go.

59:47.238 --> 59:48.239
Over here.

59:54.280 --> 59:55.039
Hey.

59:55.074 --> 59:55.764
Wait here.

01:00:04.117 --> 01:00:08.328
Sarge, the road's about
15 yards beyond that berg.

01:00:08.363 --> 01:00:11.780
I don't see it on the map.

01:00:11.815 --> 01:00:13.126
It's there.

01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:14.541
Trust me.

01:00:14.576 --> 01:00:15.750
You better be right.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.306
Hey.

01:00:29.556 --> 01:00:32.698
All commanders, spread out.

01:00:32.732 --> 01:00:35.355
Locate and destroy
the enemy tanks.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.943
Major Baker, can you hear me?

01:01:10.977 --> 01:01:13.290
Over.

01:01:13.324 --> 01:01:14.325
Creasy, can you hear me?

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.326
Over.

01:01:15.361 --> 01:01:17.156
Any luck?

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:18.053
Baker, Baker.

01:01:18.088 --> 01:01:19.089
No dice, Sarge.

01:01:19.123 --> 01:01:20.331
No sign of Creasy?

01:01:20.366 --> 01:01:21.954
Not yet.

01:01:21.988 --> 01:01:22.920
Hayes check in?

01:01:22.955 --> 01:01:25.440
No.

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:27.166
You let me know the
second you hear anything.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.339
Right away, Sergeant.

01:01:28.374 --> 01:01:29.340
Baker, baker,
can you hear me?

01:01:29.375 --> 01:01:31.101
Over.

01:01:31.135 --> 01:01:32.274
Hayes, you out there?
Over.

01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:33.068
Hey, hey.

01:01:33.103 --> 01:01:39.247
Traffic on 473.

01:01:39.281 --> 01:01:41.732
Hayes, are you out there?

01:01:41.767 --> 01:01:43.009
Red one, red one, come in.

01:01:43.044 --> 01:01:43.700
Over.

01:01:47.013 --> 01:01:48.118
Red one, red one.

01:01:48.152 --> 01:01:48.912
Anyone out there?

01:01:48.946 --> 01:01:50.154
Over.

01:01:50.189 --> 01:01:51.259
Lieutenant Hayes, is that you?

01:01:51.293 --> 01:01:52.639
Salty?

01:01:52.674 --> 01:01:53.779
It's
good to hear your voice,

01:01:53.813 --> 01:01:55.194
sir, and know
you're still alive.

01:01:55.228 --> 01:01:59.405
Salty, we're at the old
mill in grid section 4731.

01:01:59.439 --> 01:02:02.960
I got one friend with me.

01:02:02.995 --> 01:02:04.099
Do you copy?

01:02:04.134 --> 01:02:05.204
I repeat.

01:02:05.238 --> 01:02:08.310
We're located at the old
mill in gird section 4731.

01:02:08.345 --> 01:02:10.865
Grid 473, now.

01:02:16.387 --> 01:02:17.561
We've got to go.

01:02:30.885 --> 01:02:32.162
Here and here.

01:02:32.196 --> 01:02:34.060
We work our way down this
line, we should locate them.

01:02:34.095 --> 01:02:35.924
Well, what about Creasy?

01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:40.239
I want you to fortify our
position here and wait for him.

01:02:40.273 --> 01:02:41.309
Be ready for anything.

01:02:41.343 --> 01:02:42.137
You got it.

01:02:42.172 --> 01:02:43.138
Let's move.

01:02:43.173 --> 01:02:43.829
You heard him.

01:02:52.354 --> 01:02:54.080
Let's hold here, boys.

01:02:54.115 --> 01:02:55.150
Keep your eyes out.

01:03:02.951 --> 01:03:03.710
Comb the surface.

01:03:15.274 --> 01:03:17.241
Shit, shit!

01:03:17.276 --> 01:03:18.242
Reverse, reverse!

01:03:25.629 --> 01:03:26.803
I'm on the 50.

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:27.734
Cover me.

01:03:45.235 --> 01:03:46.236
Son of a bitch.

01:04:01.182 --> 01:04:02.977
That doesn't sound good.

01:04:03.011 --> 01:04:04.254
No, it don't.

01:04:04.288 --> 01:04:06.428
You got the bazooka?

01:04:06.463 --> 01:04:08.499
Made sure Ali grabbed it.

01:04:08.534 --> 01:04:10.329
Let's get it ready.

01:04:10.363 --> 01:04:11.640
We're going to
have some company.

01:04:13.988 --> 01:04:14.989
Hey.

01:04:15.023 --> 01:04:16.473
Make sure you're going
to grab the bazooka, OK?

01:04:16.507 --> 01:04:17.198
Yeah, OK.

01:04:31.971 --> 01:04:33.317
Shit.

01:04:36.596 --> 01:04:37.356
Come on.

01:04:44.397 --> 01:04:45.260
What do you?

01:04:45.295 --> 01:04:46.089
We can't stay here.

01:04:46.123 --> 01:04:46.779
I'll cover you.

01:04:46.813 --> 01:04:48.574
Go!

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:01.069
You hear that?

01:05:01.104 --> 01:05:02.415
Double time.

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:04.003
Double time, boys.

01:05:11.114 --> 01:05:13.254
I'll distract them long
enough for you to get away.

01:05:13.288 --> 01:05:14.358
No way.

01:05:14.393 --> 01:05:15.187
We're in this together.

01:05:17.637 --> 01:05:18.293
Right.

01:05:21.538 --> 01:05:23.057
Here they come.

01:05:23.091 --> 01:05:23.885
Let's do this.

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:30.443
I'm out.

01:05:30.478 --> 01:05:33.067
Me too.

01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:34.068
Here you go.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:39.763
Shit!

01:05:47.771 --> 01:05:49.842
You see anything?

01:05:49.876 --> 01:05:51.430
The Germans are
coming down the road.

01:05:51.464 --> 01:05:52.224
All right.

01:05:52.258 --> 01:05:52.914
Let's get ready.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:53.950
Let's get ready, guys.

01:06:13.866 --> 01:06:15.626
Wait till they pass.

01:06:15.661 --> 01:06:16.731
Got it.

01:06:25.153 --> 01:06:25.809
Now.

01:07:09.163 --> 01:07:09.818
All right.

01:07:09.853 --> 01:07:10.854
Wait for my signal.

01:07:16.756 --> 01:07:19.276
What do you think they're
going to do with us?

01:07:19.311 --> 01:07:20.277
I don't know.

01:07:33.256 --> 01:07:34.153
I said, get.

01:07:47.649 --> 01:07:48.340
Hey!

01:07:59.247 --> 01:08:01.698
Wait for it.

01:08:01.732 --> 01:08:02.388
Come on.

01:08:06.772 --> 01:08:07.842
Come on.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.886
the fuck off of me.

01:08:17.921 --> 01:08:18.577
Hey!

01:08:18.611 --> 01:08:19.509
Hey!

01:08:19.543 --> 01:08:20.406
Please don't do this.

01:08:20.441 --> 01:08:21.373
Don't do this, please.

01:08:21.407 --> 01:08:22.028
Get off of him.

01:08:22.063 --> 01:08:22.822
Hey.

01:08:22.857 --> 01:08:24.410
Get the fuck off of me.

01:08:24.445 --> 01:08:25.377
Hey, you piece of shit.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.249
That's the best you got?

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:42.980
No, no, no, no, no.

01:08:43.015 --> 01:08:44.775
Get the fuck off me.

01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:45.742
No!

01:08:45.776 --> 01:08:48.054
You can't do that to him.

01:08:48.089 --> 01:08:50.229
No!

01:08:50.264 --> 01:08:52.231
Hands up.

01:08:52.266 --> 01:08:52.921
Do it now.

01:09:10.974 --> 01:09:11.630
Now!

01:09:11.664 --> 01:09:12.631
Now!

01:09:15.634 --> 01:09:16.531
Now.

01:09:18.878 --> 01:09:19.534
Hands up.

01:09:23.089 --> 01:09:24.401
I said, hands up.

01:10:02.922 --> 01:10:03.613
Tie them up.

01:10:14.589 --> 01:10:17.937
Thank you, brother.

01:10:17.972 --> 01:10:19.939
Thank you.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.516
How are we doing?

01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:47.001
It honestly sounds
like we're winning, sir.

01:10:47.035 --> 01:10:48.036
All right.

01:10:48.071 --> 01:10:49.072
Lieutenant, get me some coffee.

01:10:49.106 --> 01:10:51.454
This could take all day.

01:10:51.488 --> 01:10:53.145
I'm on it, sir.

01:10:53.179 --> 01:10:54.974
We're
holding back a German assault.

01:10:55.009 --> 01:10:57.011
I repeat, we're
at-- field and are

01:10:57.045 --> 01:11:01.947
holding back a German assault.

01:11:01.981 --> 01:11:03.017
Who's this?

01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:04.501
Lieutenant Frank Ross.

01:11:04.536 --> 01:11:06.883
You must be that pilot
everybody's been looking for.

01:11:06.917 --> 01:11:09.334
I guess so.

01:11:09.368 --> 01:11:10.680
Here you go.

01:11:10.714 --> 01:11:11.957
Thanks.

01:11:11.991 --> 01:11:14.718
Let's go.

01:11:14.753 --> 01:11:15.443
All right, guys.

01:11:15.478 --> 01:11:16.651
Listen up.

01:11:16.686 --> 01:11:18.550
We're going to take their
weapons and leave them.

01:11:18.584 --> 01:11:20.759
And are
holding back a Germany assault.

01:11:20.793 --> 01:11:21.898
Set up the mortars.

01:11:21.932 --> 01:11:23.313
Hit them with artillery.

01:11:23.348 --> 01:11:24.625
Holding
back a German assault.

01:11:24.659 --> 01:11:27.869
Sends third platoon
into Go!

01:11:27.904 --> 01:11:29.457
We're in-- field

01:11:29.492 --> 01:11:31.356
and are holding back
a German assault.

01:11:33.185 --> 01:11:35.152
Salty, we're
running out of ammo,

01:11:35.187 --> 01:11:38.742
and we don't have no rockets.

01:11:51.168 --> 01:11:53.136
Sons of bitches.

01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:57.692
Creasy, smoke them!

01:11:57.727 --> 01:11:59.694
Fire!

01:12:08.772 --> 01:12:10.291
On my count.

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:11.465
3, 2, 1.

01:12:41.874 --> 01:12:42.703
Is that a fucking tank?

01:12:50.504 --> 01:12:51.470
Fire.

01:12:53.886 --> 01:12:55.474
Fire!

01:13:04.897 --> 01:13:06.485
Fire.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.798
Go.

01:13:08.832 --> 01:13:09.488
Fire!

01:13:22.777 --> 01:13:23.468
Get out.

01:13:35.272 --> 01:13:36.135
I will finish them myself.

01:13:47.664 --> 01:13:48.734
Hell yeah.

01:13:48.769 --> 01:13:49.735
Private, look.

01:14:00.574 --> 01:14:03.680
Lieutenant,
can't keep this up.

01:14:03.715 --> 01:14:05.648
Right.

01:14:05.682 --> 01:14:06.442
That's our ride.

01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:27.601
It's Hayes!

01:14:27.635 --> 01:14:28.947
Hell yeah!

01:14:36.886 --> 01:14:39.267
I'll be damned.

01:14:39.302 --> 01:14:40.268
Hold your fire.

01:14:45.722 --> 01:14:46.930
Guys, over here.

01:14:48.932 --> 01:14:50.313
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:14:50.347 --> 01:14:51.901
Where the hell are they?

01:14:59.702 --> 01:15:00.565
Get ready on three.

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:08.227
Shit.

01:15:08.262 --> 01:15:12.162
We'll draw them out.

01:15:12.197 --> 01:15:13.785
Fire!

01:15:22.103 --> 01:15:23.104
Where is that coming from?

01:15:23.139 --> 01:15:24.347
That was an 88.

01:15:24.381 --> 01:15:26.625
It's hiding in those trees.

01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:29.525
Son of a bitches.

01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:33.770
Fire!

01:15:37.118 --> 01:15:38.361
Take us out of the trees.

01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:12.637
Hell yeah?

01:16:12.671 --> 01:16:13.465
Hell yeah.

01:16:16.261 --> 01:16:17.676
Hell yeah!

01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:19.160
Hell yeah!

01:16:19.195 --> 01:16:21.611
Defensive positions, move!

01:16:21.646 --> 01:16:24.752
Go, go, go.

01:16:24.787 --> 01:16:25.477
Forward!

01:16:35.901 --> 01:16:36.592
Fire!

01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:46.256
Now!

01:17:02.548 --> 01:17:04.689
We'll finish this.

01:17:04.723 --> 01:17:05.413
Forward!

01:17:10.936 --> 01:17:14.215
Red one,
red one, we have visual.

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:15.527
We are engaging.

01:17:35.029 --> 01:17:35.996
Yeah!

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:37.307
Oh, yeah.

01:17:37.342 --> 01:17:38.032
Woo!

01:17:45.419 --> 01:17:47.214
That was the red tails.

01:17:47.248 --> 01:17:48.353
Red tails?

01:17:48.387 --> 01:17:49.906
Tuskegee airmen.

01:17:49.941 --> 01:17:50.596
Negro pilots.

01:18:18.038 --> 01:18:23.146
Men, you are the first
Negro tankers to ever

01:18:23.181 --> 01:18:25.114
fight in the American army.

01:18:25.148 --> 01:18:30.015
I never would have asked
for you if you weren't good.

01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:35.020
I have nothing but
the best in my army.

01:18:35.055 --> 01:18:40.301
I don't care what color you
are as long as you go up there

01:18:40.336 --> 01:18:43.442
and kill those Kraut
sons of bitches.

01:18:43.477 --> 01:18:48.206
Everyone has their eyes
on you and is expecting

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.933
great things from you.

01:18:50.967 --> 01:18:53.245
Don't let them down.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.007
And, damn you,
don't let me down.

01:18:59.079 --> 01:19:04.084
They say it is patriotic
to die for your country.

01:19:06.672 --> 01:19:10.469
Well, let's see
how many patriots

01:19:10.504 --> 01:19:13.507
we can make out of those
Germans sons of bitches.

01:19:15.612 --> 01:19:19.099
Detail 910, move.

01:19:19.133 --> 01:19:20.928
At arms.

01:19:29.419 --> 01:19:31.939
We're going, gentlemen.

01:19:31.974 --> 01:19:32.629
Creasy.

01:19:37.945 --> 01:19:38.808
This is him, sir.

01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:57.723
Sergeant Creasy, I
understand from my men

01:19:57.758 --> 01:20:00.554
that if it wasn't for
you, I wouldn't be here.

01:20:06.594 --> 01:20:08.838
Thank you.

01:20:08.873 --> 01:20:09.528
Sure.

01:20:17.502 --> 01:20:18.192
Carry on.

01:20:24.336 --> 01:20:24.992
Thank you.

01:20:48.326 --> 01:20:49.568
Everybody, back to work.

01:20:49.603 --> 01:20:50.811
Yes, sir.

01:21:04.721 --> 01:21:06.275
Now you look like
a proper officer.

01:21:09.416 --> 01:21:10.589
Looking good.

01:21:14.559 --> 01:21:18.597
And that's thanks
to you, Lieutenant.

01:21:18.632 --> 01:21:20.461
They sending you
back to the Air Corps?

01:21:20.496 --> 01:21:23.809
I still got one more
plane to make ace.

01:21:23.844 --> 01:21:26.812
I have no doubt you'll do it.

01:21:26.847 --> 01:21:27.848
I will never forget.

01:21:36.408 --> 01:21:37.513
Take care, brother.

01:21:37.547 --> 01:21:38.272
You too.
