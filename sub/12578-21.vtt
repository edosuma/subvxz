Hello? Hank hill,
strickland propane
.

00:45.745 --> 00:47.547
Unannounced service check.

We've got
a storage tank situation

[Gasping]

00:59.426 --> 01:01.928
Ah, mr. Winston,
we've got a problem here.

01:02.429 --> 01:03.930
When you replaced
your regulator,

01:03.930 --> 01:05.432
you didn't replace
the copper pigtail

01:05.932 --> 01:06.933
and now you've--
oh, thank god!

01:06.933 --> 01:08.852
Thank you, hank.
You saved my life.

01:08.852 --> 01:12.355
Heh, heh. A leaky pigtail's
really more
of a waste issue

01:12.355 --> 01:13.106
than a safety issue.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.941
I've been trapped
in that dang freezer

01:14.941 --> 01:16.359
since 2:00
in the morning
.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.661
I dropped
a jar of ragu,

01:18.661 --> 01:21.197
and the door slammed shut
while i was moppin' it up.

01:21.197 --> 01:23.199
If it weren't for you,
i'd be dead.

01:23.199 --> 01:24.451
Really?

01:24.451 --> 01:27.120
I saved a life.
How do you like that?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.621
I like it a lot, hank.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.206
Why don't you come bac
k this weekend?

01:30.206 --> 01:33.793
I'll give you dinner

01:33.793 --> 01:35.295
What am i sayin'?
You saved my life.

01:35.712 --> 01:37.680

01:38.181 --> 01:40.216
(hank)
And then i opened
the freezer door

01:40.216 --> 01:42.602
and damned if i didn't find
a guy in a tuxedo.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.106
Oh, hank,
you could have been killed
.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.526
Now, promise me
you will never do
something like that again.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.028
Well, hold on.
To thank me

01:52.028 --> 01:54.531

free dinner for 4

01:55.031 --> 01:56.699
including drinks but not tip.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.451
So, who should we invite?

01:58.785 --> 02:01.287
Oh, i figured
since it was
for 4 people,

02:01.287 --> 02:04.374
i'd take dale, bill,
and boomhauer.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.875
You can't go
with the guys!

02:06.376 --> 02:08.877

I don't understand.

03:30.577 --> 03:32.912
Did i do something

03:32.912 --> 03:34.581
as a patient?

03:34.581 --> 03:36.082
No, of course not.

03:36.082 --> 03:39.586
I love treating you
for migraines.

03:39.586 --> 03:40.920
Then what is it?
It's nothing.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.755
It's not nothing.
It's just...

take a night off?

03:44.257 --> 03:46.426
Do whatever you want.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.144
I don't care.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.648

03:58.905 --> 04:01.407
Oh, my god!
Hank, i was joking.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.326
I didn't mean
to invite him.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.744
I wouldn't have
even brought it up

04:05.245 --> 04:07.330
if i remembered
for a second
that he was married.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.666
Oh, they're not
even a real couple.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.668
Did you know
she only sleeps with him

04:11.668 --> 04:13.169
on his birthday
and christmas?

04:13.169 --> 04:16.839
That's why
she gets so depressed
around the holidays.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.839
[Crickets chirping]

04:23.179 --> 04:24.681

Boy! Her can looks so sexy
when she's walkin' away,

04:37.026 --> 04:40.530

08:38.900 --> 08:40.820
14 years
we've been together

08:40.820 --> 08:44.323
and i throw it all awa
y for one night
of reckless passion.

08:44.323 --> 08:47.326
Nancy, now,
you know my position
on monogamy.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.579
I am in favor of it.

08:49.579 --> 08:52.498
This is your chance
to give up the excitement
of an affair

08:52.999 --> 08:55.167
and have a normal life
with your husband.

08:55.167 --> 08:58.170
I'm sorry, sug'.
Maybe monogamy works
for you and hank,

08:58.170 --> 09:01.841
but it does not work
for me and dale
and john redcorn.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.463
Hey, baby.
Daddy's home.
You miss me?

09:07.463 --> 09:08.431

But you felt fine
when i left.

09:15.938 --> 09:16.939
Wait a minute.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.643
Every time i leave,

09:20.643 --> 09:22.228
I know what's goin' on here.

09:24.947 --> 09:28.901
Your headaches
are a desperate bi
d for my attentions.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.237
But what do i do?

09:31.237 --> 09:34.240
I pawn you off
on some indian healer

09:34.240 --> 09:36.909
so i can have my dale time
at the gun club.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.828
Or breeding show-turtles.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.915
Or on the internet,
investigating
unexplained phenomenona.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.418
God, i am so selfish!

09:45.801 --> 09:46.802

09:47.803 --> 09:50.306
.
Oh, stop
blamin' yourself, sug'

09:50.306 --> 09:54.226
in some ways
this is my fault, too.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.062
I don't deserve you.

09:56.062 --> 09:58.064
Of course you do.

09:58.564 --> 10:03.069
You are a sensitive,
trusting, sweet,
trusting man,

10:03.069 --> 10:05.438
and i don't deserve you.

10:05.905 --> 10:08.407
Are you sure
you're not an alien?

10:08.407 --> 10:10.826
'Cause you just
abducted my heart.

with his wife.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.844

10:28.844 --> 10:31.847
You and--and nancy
? are you sure?

10:31.847 --> 10:35.468
Yeah, i thought you were
withholding intimacy
to preserve your life force.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.969
I was.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.972
But then hank had to go
draggin' me
and the old lady

10:40.473 --> 10:42.558
.
To some italian romanceria

10:42.558 --> 10:45.561
next thing you know,
we're on our 2nd honeymoon

10:45.561 --> 10:49.565
only this time,
no cruise ship,
and i only vomited once.

10:51.534 --> 10:53.536
(dale)
I think i've finally
gotten to the point

10:53.536 --> 10:56.539
where i actually love her
more than my mother.

20:24.840 --> 20:28.844
.
And i shatter it
like so much lamp on scalp

20:28.844 --> 20:30.929
i can't fix that lamp.

20:30.929 --> 20:34.099
I tried, and i got
a really bad shock.

20:34.099 --> 20:37.269
But maybe i can put
you two back together.

20:37.519 --> 20:38.854
You came here for me?

20:38.854 --> 20:40.856
For both of you.

20:40.856 --> 20:43.358
What do you say,
john redcorn?

20:43.358 --> 20:46.528
Will you heal my wife,
please?

20:53.835 --> 20:54.836
No.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.172
I'm sorry, but no.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.624
You bastard!

20:58.624 --> 21:00.676
After all the help
i've given you?

21:00.676 --> 21:04.513
Dale, you've become
a true friend, which is wh
y it would be

21:04.513 --> 21:07.299
unprofessional of me
to continue seeing your wife.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.885
I understand.

21:09.885 --> 21:12.020
Wait. I guess
i could treat you.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.523
I may not be
a licensed new age healer,

21:14.523 --> 21:17.025
but i think i've walked in
on you guys often enough

21:17.025 --> 21:18.860
to know
what goes on in there.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.864
Dale, the power to heal
dwells not in the head
or the hands,

21:23.365 --> 21:24.316
but in the heart.

21:24.816 --> 21:27.736
You are a good man,
and you love nancy very much.

21:27.736 --> 21:31.323
And perhaps
love is the strongest medicine
of all.

21:32.324 --> 21:33.158
[Snickers]

21:33.158 --> 21:35.827
I'm sorry. It's just...

21:35.827 --> 21:37.496
goodbye, nancy.

21:37.496 --> 21:38.997
Goodbye, john redcorn.

21:39.331 --> 21:40.749
[Snickers]

21:44.803 --> 21:48.056
I was gettin'
a weird vibe in there.

21:48.423 --> 21:49.675
You think he's gay?

22:04.556 --> 22:06.558
