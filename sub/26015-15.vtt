black in this thing?

09:10.174 --> 09:11.676

09:11.759 --> 09:13.094
- Tony's being smart.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.595
{\an3}He's doing a quick color
study on that piece.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.638
It's a good drawing,

09:15.721 --> 09:16.806
{\an3}but it's got some
tricks in it.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.974
- It does have
some tricks in it.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.475
- Leave this the shine...
- Okay.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.602
{\an3}- And then I'd have darks
everywhere else.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.145

I came here thinking

make it,

09:33.239 --> 09:35.116

darker than that tone.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.158

09:36.242 --> 09:37.660
