Wow, Naomi,
the lighthouse looks great.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.250
I didn't expect you
to change so much.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.330
You put me in charge
of fixing up the lighthouse,

01:19.330 --> 01:21.920
so I fixed it up,
and here's the best part.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.120
Isabel helped me build
a new type of lantern.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.040
We call it
the light writer.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.920
By making the light
flash on and off,

01:28.920 --> 01:30.920
we can send messages
out to ships at sea.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.920
Now there's a bright
idea.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.790
Har-har.
Here, I'll show you
how it works.

01:36.790 --> 01:39.000
My dad's out on
a patrol ship,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.040
so I'll send him
a message right now.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.920
- Naomi, I've been looking
all over for you.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.750
You got another letter
from Captain Turner.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.460
Wait, your dad
mailed you a letter?

01:49.460 --> 01:50.880
No, Your Majesty.

01:50.880 --> 01:53.250
The other Captain Turner.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.880
My mom.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.120
Oh. How long has she
been at sea now?

01:57.120 --> 01:58.880
Six months, three weeks,
and two days.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.460
But who's counting?

02:00.460 --> 02:01.790
She finished her voyage,

02:01.790 --> 02:04.380
and is on her way
to Avalor,

02:04.380 --> 02:07.210
and has a big surprise
to tell me and Dad
when she gets here.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.620
When's that?

02:08.620 --> 02:11.710
She said two weeks,
but wait.

02:11.710 --> 02:13.540
She sent the letter
two weeks ago,

02:13.540 --> 02:16.710
so that means she
should be here today!

02:16.710 --> 02:18.500
!
- I better tell Dad.

02:18.500 --> 02:22.540
Wait, you're really
sending him a message
with light.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.170
It's a code.
Certain patterns
equal letters

02:24.170 --> 02:26.040
that spell out
my message.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.750
You've outdone yourself
again.

02:31.580 --> 02:34.670
Scarlett's... coming...
home?

02:34.670 --> 02:36.710
Today?!

02:36.710 --> 02:40.290
Ready the sails, men,
we're heading back to port.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.960
Aye, aye,
Captain Turner.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.880
I've gotta get our house
in shipshape before Mom arrives.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.920
- I hope I have
enough time.
- I can help you.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.830
You say that now,
but you've never
been to our place.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.500
It's a little messy.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.000
Oh, come on.
How bad could it be?

02:55.920 --> 02:58.250
Yep, that's
pretty bad.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.920
I think we're gonna
need reinforcements.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.790
Reinforcements
have arrived!

03:04.790 --> 03:06.380
Wow, that was fast.

03:06.380 --> 03:08.380
The love of my life
is coming home.

03:08.380 --> 03:10.710
She's worth
the extra hustle.

03:10.710 --> 03:13.420
Okay, we'll clean downstairs
if you clean upstairs.

03:13.420 --> 03:14.880
Let's go, men.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.000
BOTH: Aye, aye,
Captain Turner.

03:22.250 --> 03:25.290
What do you think
your mom's big surprise
is gonna be?

03:25.290 --> 03:27.380
I don't know.

03:27.380 --> 03:30.290
I'm hoping...
well, I don't wanna
jinx it by saying it out loud.

03:30.290 --> 03:32.120
It's okay.
You can tell me.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.710
I've spent most of
my life traveling.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.290
I've never really
felt like I had a home,

03:39.290 --> 03:41.330
until I came to Avalor.

03:41.330 --> 03:43.460
There's just one thing
I want

03:43.460 --> 03:46.790
that would make
everything perfect.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.080
Ho ho, is that
the Wayfarer I hear?

05:51.080 --> 05:53.170
( bell continues
ringing )

05:53.170 --> 05:55.790
Ahoy, family!

05:55.790 --> 05:57.670
Ahoy, Mom!

05:57.670 --> 06:00.040
Should we go
meet her?

06:00.040 --> 06:02.710
- No need. She'll
take care of that.

06:11.380 --> 06:12.920
Nomes!

06:12.920 --> 06:14.420
Mom!

06:16.790 --> 06:18.380
Captain Turner.

06:18.380 --> 06:20.330
Captain Turner.

06:20.330 --> 06:21.710
Oh!

06:21.710 --> 06:23.750
Welcome back.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.170
Ha ha!

06:26.210 --> 06:28.540
It's good
to be back.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.500
Mom, I want you
to meet Elena.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.120
Oh, Crown Princess.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.920
Naomi's written me
all about you.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.460
Good to meetcha!

06:37.460 --> 06:39.460
The pleasure's
all mi-i-i-ine!

06:41.250 --> 06:43.750
So, what's your
big surprise?

06:43.750 --> 06:46.750
Don't you wanna tell me
what's been going on
with you first?

06:46.750 --> 06:48.330
Nope. Big surprise.
Now, please.

06:48.330 --> 06:50.880
Okay.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.330
Remember our old plan
that I would find a job

06:52.330 --> 06:54.580
where I didn't have
to travel so much?

06:54.580 --> 06:56.920
So we can settle
down in one place.
Uh-huh.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.250
Well, I finally
got that job,

07:00.250 --> 07:02.670
in the kingdom
of Norberg.

07:02.670 --> 07:05.460
!

07:05.460 --> 07:07.250
The kingdom
we came from,

07:07.250 --> 07:08.750
where Naomi was born.

07:08.750 --> 07:13.170
I'm the new admiral
of the Norberg coast guard.

07:13.170 --> 07:14.620
So you're leaving Avalor?

07:14.620 --> 07:16.540
That's right.

07:16.540 --> 07:18.580
We sail out
in four days.

07:18.580 --> 07:21.120
!
- Another move.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.750
This certainly is
a big surprise,

07:23.750 --> 07:26.790
but I suppose it means
we'll all be together,

07:26.790 --> 07:29.330
just like you
always wanted, Naomi.

07:29.330 --> 07:30.710
I guess so.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.080
Then start packing.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.210
I have a ship to dock.

07:46.830 --> 07:50.380
I can't believe
you're leaving Avalor.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.460
I don't wanna
leave, Elena.

07:52.460 --> 07:53.750
I might've been
born in Norberg,

07:53.750 --> 07:56.380
but I haven't lived there
since I was two.

07:56.380 --> 07:58.790
My real home
is here in Avalor,

07:58.790 --> 08:00.710
with the grand council.

08:00.710 --> 08:02.250
My friends.
You!

08:04.040 --> 08:07.330
But my mom got this job,

08:07.330 --> 08:09.750
so I guess
I have to go.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.750
Well, what if
I offered her

08:12.750 --> 08:15.250
- a better job
in Avalor?

08:15.250 --> 08:18.000
I'd do whatever it took
to get you to stay.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.960
That's... wow.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.710
Thanks, Elena.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.710
But when my mom
has her mind set on something,

08:23.710 --> 08:25.920
it can be pretty hard
to change it.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.500
Well, lucky for you,
I'm the same way.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.920
Where are you going?

08:29.920 --> 08:31.620
I have to get
everything ready.

08:31.620 --> 08:32.750
See you tomorrow.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.540
Wait. Ready for what?

08:38.880 --> 08:42.540
Okay, a-one
and a-two and a...

08:42.540 --> 08:44.920
( mariachi music plays,
cat yowls )

08:44.920 --> 08:46.960
Princess Elena?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.380
Good morning,
Captain Turner.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.750
Naomi has told me
countless stories

08:51.750 --> 08:55.170
of your heroic deeds
as captain of the Sea Farer.

08:55.170 --> 08:56.710
- Wayfarer.
- Wayfarer.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.710
And it occurred to me
that we needed someone

08:59.710 --> 09:02.750
with your naval know-how,
right here in Avalor.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.540
Now I know Norberg
has already offered you
an admiral's post,

09:06.540 --> 09:08.830
so I am prepared
to make you

09:08.830 --> 09:11.710
the supreme commanding
master chief admiral

09:11.710 --> 09:14.210
of the Avalor coast guard.

09:14.210 --> 09:17.830
I've never heard
of such a position.

09:17.830 --> 09:20.830
Well, that's because
I created it just for you.

09:20.830 --> 09:23.750
Just for me?
What an honor.

09:23.750 --> 09:24.790
So you'll accept?

09:24.790 --> 09:26.500
No, I'm afraid not.

09:28.790 --> 09:31.750
But you also get
your very own horse...

09:31.750 --> 09:33.750
and carriage.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Thank you, but no.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.420
But wait, there's more.

09:41.420 --> 09:42.920
You also get
any ship in the fleet.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.380
Just take your pick.

09:46.830 --> 09:47.880
It's still a no.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.120
I'm still not done.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.790
If you say yes
within the next ten seconds,

09:51.790 --> 09:54.580
I'll throw in new set of
stainless steel swords!

09:56.790 --> 09:59.790
Princess Elena,
I can't tell you

09:59.790 --> 10:02.880
how grateful I am
for your generous offer.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.080
But Norberg is my home.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.880
It's where I grew up.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.710
It's where
my happiest memories are.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.540
And it's the land I love.

10:11.540 --> 10:14.040
Good old Norberg.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.250
Now if you don't mind,

10:18.250 --> 10:20.960
I've gotta start preparing
my ship for the voyage.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.120
You wanna give me
a hand, Nomes?

10:23.120 --> 10:24.880
Maybe later.
I have to finish

10:24.880 --> 10:26.790
fixing up the lighthouse
before we go.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.670
That's my Naomi.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.540
I mean, our Naomi.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.540
Well, thanks
for trying.

10:34.540 --> 10:36.420
I guess I should start
saying my good-byes.

10:36.420 --> 10:38.880
We have three days left.
We're not sunk yet.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.250
What do you mean?
You heard my mom.

10:41.250 --> 10:44.920
Then we're just gonna
have to make her fall
in love with Avalor.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.500
- With a little help
from our friends.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.040
Target approaching.
Remember what Elena said.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.250
If you can help convince
Captain Scarlett Turner

10:55.250 --> 10:57.210
to fall in love
with Avalor and stay--

10:57.210 --> 11:00.920
Then the princess
will officially
owe me a favor.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.920
Don't worry,
I never forget a debt.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.920
Thanks for
the VIP tour, princess.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.750
My pleasure.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.580
This is
the Via Mercado,

11:09.580 --> 11:12.540
the biggest marketplace
in the entire hemisphere.

11:12.540 --> 11:15.540
This is more impressive
than the three-headed
flying fan fish

11:15.540 --> 11:17.790
I saw off the coast
of Corinthia.

11:17.790 --> 11:21.250
Watch how a master salesman
closes a deal.

11:23.290 --> 11:26.750
Oh, you must be the famous
Captain Scarlett Turner

11:26.750 --> 11:29.290
everyone is talking about.

11:29.290 --> 11:31.120
I am Doña Paloma.

11:31.120 --> 11:34.120
Doña Paloma!
Good to meetcha.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.040
Naomi wrote about you.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.460
You own the biggest warehouse
in town, right?

11:39.500 --> 11:42.420
Warehouse?
Uh... ahem.

11:42.420 --> 11:45.120
My emporium features
incredible wonders

11:45.120 --> 11:47.120
from all over Avalor...

11:47.120 --> 11:49.040
and the world.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.710
I'm gonna warn ya.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.710
I've seen my fair share
of wonders in all my travels.

11:54.710 --> 11:58.120
But have you ever seen
all the wonders under one roof,

11:58.120 --> 12:01.500
during a "free
sample day" event?

12:01.500 --> 12:03.750
Free sample day?

12:03.750 --> 12:06.830
Where the kids eat free,
as do the captains of the sea.

12:06.830 --> 12:08.710
Right this way.

12:08.710 --> 12:12.460
No one can resist
the call of the free.

12:12.460 --> 12:15.830
The fruits and vegetables
are all hand-picked

12:15.830 --> 12:18.880
from the Avaloran
rain forest.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.120
Oh, they do
look scrumptious.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.380
They taste even better.

12:26.380 --> 12:30.670
Mmm! I've never tasted
anything so delicious.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.920
Not even in Norberg?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.830
Not even
in Norberg.

12:34.830 --> 12:37.710
Ooh, what's that?

12:39.710 --> 12:41.880
Thank you, Doña.

12:41.880 --> 12:45.540
I finally get why
everyone loves Avalor so much.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.710
- It's as clear

12:47.710 --> 12:49.540
as Merroway Sea at dawn.

12:49.540 --> 12:53.120
And it makes me
want to stay right here...

12:53.120 --> 12:55.620
and spend the rest of the day
getting souvenirs

12:55.620 --> 12:57.290
to take back to Norberg.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.250
Come on, Nomes.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.210
If I couldn't
change her mind,

13:02.210 --> 13:04.330
no one will.

13:04.330 --> 13:06.790
Well, it was nice
knowing you, Naomi.

13:06.790 --> 13:09.380
Come on, Gabe.
There's still two more days.

13:09.380 --> 13:11.580
But what do we do?

13:11.580 --> 13:13.830
Maybe if your mother knew
how much you were needed here,

13:13.830 --> 13:14.790
she'd change her mind.

13:14.790 --> 13:17.790
I think we have
to show her

13:17.790 --> 13:20.330
just how important
you are to Avalor.

13:20.330 --> 13:21.920
How do we do that?

13:21.920 --> 13:23.710
Wait till
the sun goes down.

13:23.710 --> 13:27.170
Then everyone
will see the light.

13:27.170 --> 13:29.460
Our lighthouse
was in shambles,

13:29.460 --> 13:33.460
until Naomi was
put in charge of
overseeing its restoration.

13:33.460 --> 13:36.920
Oh! What's this?

13:36.920 --> 13:38.790
It's called
a light writer.

13:38.790 --> 13:40.330
My sister helped
Naomi build it

13:40.330 --> 13:41.920
so we can communicate
with ships in the harbor.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.540
- Impressive.
- Thanks, Mom.

13:44.540 --> 13:47.380
And she even taught me
how to use it.

13:47.380 --> 13:49.080
What did you tell them?

13:49.080 --> 13:51.080
To ring a bell
for the Turners.

13:56.620 --> 13:58.790
Amazing!

13:58.790 --> 14:01.330
Yeah. I don't know
what we'd do without Naomi.

14:01.330 --> 14:04.380
- I hear you
loud and clear.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.170
We have to leave
as soon as possible,

14:06.170 --> 14:09.170
so you can build a light writer
in Norberg's lighthouse.

14:09.170 --> 14:11.170
I'm gonna get
everything ready

14:11.170 --> 14:12.960
- so we can
ship out tomorrow.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.380
Soon, you'll hear
all the bells in Norberg

14:16.380 --> 14:18.790
ringing just for you.
Oop!

14:23.330 --> 14:25.920
Uh, we could have Mateo
cast a spell.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.500
He can make the wind
stop blowing,

14:27.500 --> 14:29.670
so your family's
ship can't leave.

14:29.670 --> 14:32.380
That would stop
all the other ships
in the harbor, too.

14:32.380 --> 14:34.540
Good point.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.330
Maybe Mateo could
make a potion

14:37.330 --> 14:39.880
that turns the water
to ice.

14:39.880 --> 14:40.830
Same problem.

14:40.830 --> 14:42.880
You're right.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.710
Oh, I've got
the perfect plan.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.750
We'll sink
your mom's ship.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.790
Okay, maybe that's not
the perfect plan.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.920
Ugh, I still can't believe
your mom turned down the chance

14:52.920 --> 14:55.880
to be supreme commanding
master chief admiral.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.880
That's the highest imaginary
rank I've ever made up.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.170
Ah!

14:59.170 --> 15:02.420
So you did offer
Scarlett Turner

15:02.420 --> 15:04.000
a post in
the Avalor coast guard.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.580
Oh, uh...

15:05.580 --> 15:07.710
Hi, abuelo.

15:07.710 --> 15:09.580
You, ahem,
heard about that?

15:09.580 --> 15:11.330
She did it for me.

15:11.330 --> 15:13.170
I love Avalor,
and I don't wanna leave,

15:13.170 --> 15:15.000
but my mom wants me
to move to Norberg.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.500
Elena and I tried
a million things
to change her mind,

15:17.500 --> 15:19.830
but nothing's worked,
and now, we're all out of ideas.

15:19.830 --> 15:22.080
Did you try
telling her the truth?

15:22.080 --> 15:24.830
The truth?

15:24.830 --> 15:27.420
Huh. Why didn't
we think of that?

15:27.420 --> 15:29.210
Because it would
never work.

15:29.210 --> 15:31.920
I wouldn't be
so sure, Naomi.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.920
If you really
want to stay,

15:33.920 --> 15:36.960
you have to at least
tell her how you feel.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.880
Do you really think
that would change her mind?

15:38.880 --> 15:40.920
It's worth a try.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.790
And you've tried
everything else.

15:45.330 --> 15:48.790
Mom, Dad, did you know
nine out of ten doctors

15:48.790 --> 15:50.830
say living in the tropics
is better for your health?

15:50.830 --> 15:53.080
No. More direct.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.080
Mom, Dad, I like
living in Avalor,

15:56.080 --> 15:57.710
and I don't wanna leave.

15:57.710 --> 15:59.670
That's it.

15:59.670 --> 16:01.620
( music playing,
Scarlett laughing )

16:03.080 --> 16:05.120
Mom, what are you doing?

16:05.120 --> 16:08.920
As we were packing, I found
the violin in the closet.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.330
Your mom thought we
should celebrate our big move

16:11.330 --> 16:13.920
with an old family tradition.
Dance with me.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.380
Can we talk first?

16:15.380 --> 16:16.880
Oh, come on.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.750
You used to love dancing
the Norberg jig.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.620
I did?
I don't remember, but--

16:21.620 --> 16:24.080
I do. You'd put
your feet on top
of my feet,

16:24.080 --> 16:26.290
and we would dance
around the house
like this.

16:26.290 --> 16:27.790
- NAOMI: Whoa!

16:27.790 --> 16:31.330
And you would laugh
just like that.

16:33.790 --> 16:37.170
When we get to Norberg,
we'll do a lot more dancing.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.120
And we'll have dinner
together every night,

16:39.120 --> 16:41.170
and we won't ever
spend a holiday apart.

16:41.170 --> 16:44.500
- And play fun games
at the fair?
- Absolutely!

16:50.250 --> 16:52.670
The way I feel
right now,

16:52.670 --> 16:55.710
I don't think
anything could take
the wind out of my sails.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.790
So what was it you wanted
to talk about, Nomes?

16:57.790 --> 16:59.710
Oh.

16:59.710 --> 17:02.540
Well... nothing.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.170
It's not important.

17:06.710 --> 17:09.620
Well, how did it go
with your parents last night?

17:09.620 --> 17:11.580
I didn't tell them.

17:11.580 --> 17:12.830
Why not?

17:12.830 --> 17:15.380
Because they've been
dreaming of this

17:15.380 --> 17:18.000
for so long,
it's gonna make
them so happy.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.790
And I just...

17:20.790 --> 17:23.420
I want my family
to be together.

17:23.420 --> 17:25.580
So...

17:25.580 --> 17:27.420
we're leaving today.

17:27.420 --> 17:28.830
Today?

17:28.830 --> 17:30.540
Uh-huh.

17:30.540 --> 17:32.920
Well, if you can't stay,

17:32.920 --> 17:37.170
I... I hope you'll
let me do one last
thing for you,

17:37.170 --> 17:40.540
and give you
a proper good-bye.

17:40.540 --> 17:43.790
Okay. I'd like that.

17:57.120 --> 17:59.380
Naomi Turner,

17:59.380 --> 18:01.540
we are pleased
to present you

18:01.540 --> 18:04.710
with this medallion of
Maruvian blue crystal,

18:04.710 --> 18:06.710
as a symbol of thanks

18:06.710 --> 18:08.750
for your service on
the grand council.

18:12.330 --> 18:14.330
Thanks, Elena.

18:14.330 --> 18:16.580
You were like the sister
I never had.

18:18.750 --> 18:22.500
And you two were like
grandparents to me.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.500
I'm not sure
what I'm gonna miss more--

18:24.500 --> 18:27.420
your guitar playing,
or your tamales.

18:27.420 --> 18:30.380
- My guitar playing.
- My tamales.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.710
And Esteban.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.960
You're... you're...

18:34.960 --> 18:38.540
Hmph. The feeling is mutual,
I assure you.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.170
And you two.

18:42.170 --> 18:43.960
Like your big brother
and little brother.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.330
Yeah, he means that
the other way around.

18:46.330 --> 18:48.170
Ow!

18:48.170 --> 18:50.960
Oh, Gabe,
are you crying?

18:50.960 --> 18:52.500
What?! No!

18:52.500 --> 18:54.880
I just got
something in my eye.

18:54.880 --> 18:58.170
Naomi, before we
escort you to your ship,

18:58.170 --> 19:00.040
a few more friends
wanted a chance

19:00.040 --> 19:01.670
to say their
last good-byes.

19:13.750 --> 19:16.750
Wow. Looks like
the whole kingdom showed up.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.710
I'm gonna
miss you, Naomi.

19:18.710 --> 19:20.330
- Don't forget to write.
- Good luck in Norberg.

19:20.330 --> 19:21.710
I didn't realize

19:21.710 --> 19:23.790
Naomi meant
so much to Avalor.

19:23.790 --> 19:25.790
Well, she does
take after her mom.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.330
Wherever she goes,
she makes a difference.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.000
You're so sweet.

19:48.170 --> 19:50.080
You didn't have
to do all this.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.710
I wanted to.
Have a safe journey.

19:52.710 --> 19:54.670
I'll miss you.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.380
I'll miss you, too.

20:02.710 --> 20:04.540
Ready to go, Nomes?

20:08.380 --> 20:09.670
Huh?

20:16.290 --> 20:18.830
All right, that's it.
Stop!

20:18.830 --> 20:21.500
Stop the music.
Stop, stop everything.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.500
Just everybody, stop!

20:25.500 --> 20:27.500
Naomi, when you were little,

20:27.500 --> 20:29.880
you used to get rope burns
trying to tie

20:29.880 --> 20:32.120
fancy sailor knots
on our ship,

20:32.120 --> 20:34.290
but you thought that
was just part of the job,

20:34.290 --> 20:35.920
so you put on
a tough face,

20:35.920 --> 20:37.420
and acted like
you weren't hurting.

20:37.420 --> 20:39.080
What's that got
to do with...

20:39.080 --> 20:42.420
You've got that same
kind of look on your
face right now.

20:42.420 --> 20:43.830
So what is it?

20:43.830 --> 20:45.750
I...

20:45.750 --> 20:47.500
Um...

20:47.500 --> 20:49.000
Everything is all right.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.620
I'm so happy that
we're finally all together.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.040
I just...

20:53.040 --> 20:55.830
I wish we could
be together here

20:55.830 --> 20:57.460
in Avalor.

20:59.670 --> 21:02.120
This is the first place

21:02.120 --> 21:04.830
I've lived that really
feels like home.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.830
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

21:06.830 --> 21:10.170
Because I knew you'd both
rather live in Norberg.

21:12.380 --> 21:14.750
Nomes, home is where
the heart is.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.880
Your heart is
here in Avalor,

21:16.880 --> 21:19.580
and my heart
is with both of you,

21:19.580 --> 21:21.330
wherever we are.

21:21.330 --> 21:22.960
And I'm happy to live
anywhere,

21:22.960 --> 21:24.960
as long as
we're all together.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.330
Then it's settled.

21:26.330 --> 21:28.500
We're staying in Avalor.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.460
BOTH: Yes!

21:32.580 --> 21:36.000
So is that job offer
still open, princess?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.580
Ye...

21:37.580 --> 21:38.960
Uh, I have to check.

21:40.540 --> 21:42.790
I'm sure we can
find something.

21:42.790 --> 21:44.540
All right!

21:44.540 --> 21:46.620
Guess we should let
everyone know the good news.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.540
The Turners are staying
in Avalor!

21:54.880 --> 21:56.880
Welcome home.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.460
Home.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.290
That has a nice
ring to it.
