- Uh, I don't know.

Maybe because the cis,
white, hetero, male board

05:00.842 --> 05:04.220

or trans or nonbinary folk.

Obviously, I can't talk

Alicia and I are back together.

I'm down.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.194

- Um...

26:11.278 --> 26:13.655
Yeah, sorry. I'm just a
little distracted this morning.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.657
- Is this still about that girl
from the magazine?

26:15.740 --> 26:17.534
Why don't you just talk
to her, right?

26:17.617 --> 26:19.619
I'm sure she would be open
to hearing you out.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.580

meeting about it at, uh, 10:15.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.623
