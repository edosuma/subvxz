            Sorry.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.655
 Can you give us one second,
           please?

37:05.691 --> 37:09.526
             Hey.
             Hi.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.696
Do you remember what I got you
on our last Christmas together?

37:12.731 --> 37:14.331
        You remember?
          Earrings.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.300
        Whoa... nice.
        Yeah... mm-hm.

37:17.336 --> 37:20.337
 Yes, I did, antique earrings.

37:20.372 --> 37:24.741
 With little sapphire insets,
       your birthstone.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.276
        They are lovely.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.644
                 Thank you.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.080
         You're gonna love what
           I got you this year.

37:30.115 --> 37:31.815
           Come on.
    No, no, no, no, stop.

37:31.850 --> 37:35.018
I know I shouldn't have gotten
  you anything at all, okay?

37:35.053 --> 37:37.887
         but I saw this and you
     said you wanted it once...

37:37.923 --> 37:41.324
        and I-- I had to get it.

37:41.360 --> 37:45.095
Wait a second. You remembered
  that I liked something...

37:45.130 --> 37:47.864
  and then you got it for me?

37:47.899 --> 37:51.034
             Wow.
         Hah-hah-hah.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.303
  Yes, I did. You're horrible.

37:53.338 --> 37:55.705
      I'm just kidding.
      I'm just kidding.

37:55.741 --> 37:59.309
  Do you want to have dinner
     tonight? You and me?

37:59.344 --> 38:03.380
   Tonight? I can't tonight.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.749
  I'm going on a sleigh ride
      with the Larsons.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.018
    Going on a sl-- the who?

38:08.053 --> 38:12.022
The people that own the lodge.
  You know, Sophie and Zoe--

38:12.057 --> 38:14.190
                  And Matt.

38:14.226 --> 38:15.425
          Yes... Matt.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.762
            Mm-hm.
            Mm-hm.

38:18.797 --> 38:23.099
Cool, yeah, it's gonna be fun.
            Yeah.

38:23.135 --> 38:25.568
      We'll do it another night.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.037
          [BARBARA]
   All right, are you good?

38:27.072 --> 38:29.105
            Yeah.
All right, we're going again.

38:29.141 --> 38:31.207
    [MAN] Quiet, everyone!
      Yeah, we're great.

38:31.243 --> 38:32.676
[MAN] Roll sound!

38:32.711 --> 38:35.512
  Hey, Jessica, did you know
   that Hailey Sheppard...

38:35.547 --> 38:39.049
    this girl in my class,
       she has a horse.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.784
      I did not know that.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.452
   We're not getting a horse.

38:42.487 --> 38:45.322
     Well, of course not!
 That would just be copying.

38:45.357 --> 38:50.193
  We need something special,
        like a zebra.

38:50.228 --> 38:52.062
        Ooh, a zebra.
           A zebra?

38:52.097 --> 38:53.630
 Where would we put a zebra?
    A zebra would be cool.

38:53.665 --> 38:54.898
        Oh, here we go!

39:02.140 --> 39:04.674
          Thank you.
       You're welcome.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.846
                Ooh, here we go!

    <i> ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

39:35.640 --> 39:39.142
               Hey. What's this?

39:39.177 --> 39:41.077
 Hot chocolate.

39:41.113 --> 39:44.114
           Thanks.
       You're welcome.

39:48.320 --> 39:52.122
            No marshmallows?

39:52.157 --> 39:55.492
    Come on.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.431
   <i> ( SOFT MUSIC CONTINUES )</i>

40:01.466 --> 40:04.300
   What's Christmas like in
          Hollywood?

40:04.336 --> 40:07.670
   Well... warmer than this.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.340
         Oh... here.
             Oh.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.011
        There you go.
          Thank you.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.147
  Do you spend it with movie
            stars?

40:17.182 --> 40:18.982
     Christmas? Sometimes.

40:19.017 --> 40:22.152
Yeah, there's usually a party
     going on somewhere.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.387
        Not this year?
             No.

40:24.423 --> 40:26.389
 No, I could spend it with my
        family, but...

40:26.425 --> 40:29.826
      I tend to mess up
    the holidays for them.

40:29.861 --> 40:32.228
I feel like they should be able
to enjoy them...

40:32.264 --> 40:34.731
without the burden of paparazzi
or fans.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.332
   You can spend it with us.

40:36.368 --> 40:37.934
               Soph...

40:37.969 --> 40:39.402
       It's a lot of fun.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.638
We have the festival of lights
     on Christmas Eve...

40:41.673 --> 40:44.874
 and then I go to bed early,
      so I can get up...

40:44.910 --> 40:47.010
and then we can open presents
         by the tree.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.778
 Wow, that does sound like fun.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.780
 Sophie, I think Jessica has
    better things to do...

40:50.816 --> 40:53.450
than spend her Christmas here
        in Homestead.

40:53.485 --> 40:56.486
 What's better than Christmas
        in Homestead?

40:56.521 --> 41:00.356
         Look at it.
    It's like... perfect.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.861
 Yes, it is.

41:11.136 --> 41:14.537
So, what was Christmas like when
you were growing up here?

41:14.573 --> 41:18.041
              Loud, it was loud.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.943
    No, there was always people
                    everywhere.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.946
     Family, always singing and
         eating lots of food...

41:22.981 --> 41:27.450
          and opening presents,
      it was just always crazy.

41:27.486 --> 41:30.220
Yeah, that's the kind of
Christmas I would like to have.

41:30.255 --> 41:31.888
         For sure.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.057
          So, why don't you.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.432
  Oh! Here we go, almost done.

 It's over already?

41:44.236 --> 41:46.469
         Just about.
           Aw, man.

41:46.505 --> 41:48.271
    Unless you want to-- do you
       want to go around again?

41:48.306 --> 41:49.572

41:51.476 --> 41:54.377
   Okay, yeah, let's do it.
       Yeah, all right.

            Hello.

        think you are.

     have to do it again.

        an hour past.

                   done here...

42:28.046 --> 42:29.245
 and then everyone can join in.

42:29.281 --> 42:30.880
 Oh, good, I'll tell everyone.

42:30.916 --> 42:32.549
         Okay, great. I'm sorry
            we're running late.

42:32.584 --> 42:33.883
 Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.

having fun anyway.

      Who, me? No... no.

       No, no, no, no.

42:40.425 --> 42:42.091
Know your limits, that's what
        I always say.

42:42.127 --> 42:43.226
[MATT] I'm surprised you haven't
heard me say that.

42:43.261 --> 42:44.894
        I always say it.

42:44.930 --> 42:48.531
   No, I asked Santa Claus
 for coordination, we'll see.

42:48.567 --> 42:51.267
He's very busy.

42:51.303 --> 42:53.036
  What did you ask Santa for?

42:53.071 --> 42:56.072
I don't know, I haven't really
      thought about it.

42:56.107 --> 43:00.977
        I'm-- I'm pretty lucky,
      I have everything I need.

43:01.012 --> 43:04.080
It's not about what you need,
it's about what you wish for.

43:04.115 --> 43:05.448
It's about...

43:05.483 --> 43:07.016
            Family.

43:07.052 --> 43:10.320
      Yeah, yeah, family.

43:10.355 --> 43:12.689
               Yeah.

43:23.902 --> 43:28.104
      Yeah. Don't... fall.

43:39.584 --> 43:42.085
      So, this is my room.

43:42.120 --> 43:45.254
       Wow. This is cool.

43:45.290 --> 43:46.322
              Thanks.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.028
 Look at that.

43:52.063 --> 43:54.330
I look so strong in that
picture!

43:54.366 --> 43:56.165
          You are strong.

43:56.201 --> 43:58.868
Well, I play a strong character.

43:58.903 --> 44:00.870
 What's the difference?

44:00.905 --> 44:04.874
   Well, a strong character
     makes a movie great.

44:04.909 --> 44:07.443
 Strong people make the world
            great.

44:07.479 --> 44:10.513
       When I grow up,
     I want to be strong.

44:10.548 --> 44:11.881
          And famous!

44:11.916 --> 44:13.316
               Famous for what?

44:13.351 --> 44:15.218
       Just for being me.

44:15.253 --> 44:18.688
Well, luckily that's why they
    created the internet.

44:23.728 --> 44:26.929
[SOPHIE] So where are you going
to spend Christmas this year?

44:26.965 --> 44:30.900
          [JESSICA]
  At home... in Los Angeles.

44:30.935 --> 44:32.301
         [SOPHIE] Why?

44:32.337 --> 44:34.070
          [JESSICA]
 Because that's where I live.

44:34.105 --> 44:36.105
           [SOPHIE]
  That's not what you said.

44:36.141 --> 44:37.640
               What do you mean?

44:37.676 --> 44:40.410
 In "Asterlight: The Dragon's
      Lair" you said...

44:40.445 --> 44:44.047
 "Home isn't where you live,
    it's where you love."

44:45.917 --> 44:48.584
It was my mom's favorite one,
             too.

44:51.456 --> 44:53.122
            It was?

44:53.158 --> 44:54.424
            Uh-huh.

44:54.459 --> 44:56.059
She went to heaven when I was
          little...

44:56.094 --> 44:58.461
 so I don't really remember...

44:58.496 --> 45:03.766
but Aunt Zoe told me that she
  really liked your movies.

45:03.802 --> 45:05.935
       And now I do, too.

45:10.942 --> 45:14.110
You know, just because somebody
isn't around...

45:14.145 --> 45:17.413
   doesn't mean they aren't
     thinking about you.

45:17.449 --> 45:18.581
            Really?

45:18.616 --> 45:20.049
                  Sure.

45:20.085 --> 45:22.518
 Look at Santa Claus. He only
  comes around once a year.

45:22.554 --> 45:25.321
    The rest of the time,
  he's thinking about you...

45:25.356 --> 45:29.392
 and keeping track of whether
   you're naughty or nice.

45:29.427 --> 45:30.526
 I'm nice!

45:30.562 --> 45:31.928
             Of course, you are.

45:31.963 --> 45:33.129
         And he knows that, too.

45:33.164 --> 45:34.363
               So when he comes
               for Christmas...

45:34.399 --> 45:36.733
 he can bring you the perfect
            gift.

45:36.768 --> 45:39.902
       Okay. That's cool.

45:39.938 --> 45:41.971
  Do you know what you want
        for Christmas?

45:43.274 --> 45:44.807
            I think so.

45:44.843 --> 45:46.609
        [JESSICA] What?

45:46.644 --> 45:47.910
[SOPHIE]
I can't tell you.

45:47.946 --> 45:51.214
Christmas wishes are just
between you and Santa.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.916
Got it. You're absolutely right.

45:53.952 --> 45:58.454
Well, whatever it is, I'm sure
     you're gonna get it.

46:04.896 --> 46:05.928
           Hey, Dad.

46:05.964 --> 46:07.263
 Hey, what's going on in here?

46:07.298 --> 46:09.899
Jessica and I were just talking
about Christmas.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.634
                     Christmas?

46:11.669 --> 46:14.137
 Okay, you all know the rules.

46:14.172 --> 46:17.640
  It's just like dodge ball,
  try to avoid getting hit.

46:17.675 --> 46:19.709
     If you do, you're out.

46:19.744 --> 46:23.880
 The last team standing wins!
           We know.

46:23.915 --> 46:27.250
May the best team win in three,
two, one...

    to do? Go back to LA?

   special and your town...

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:08.997
   is going to play a huge
         part in it.

you, but this final scene...

01:06:31.955 --> 01:06:34.656

Eve is going to be amazing.

              said sometimes...

to decide what comes first...

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:19.220
            Yeah.
                 Right?

01:14:19.255 --> 01:14:20.855
   Speaking of, you haven't
        said a word...

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:22.323
about my Christmas present yet.

01:14:22.358 --> 01:14:25.059
What do you mean?

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:26.160
      You haven't seen it?

01:14:26.196 --> 01:14:27.829
            What!?
     You haven't seen it?

01:14:27.864 --> 01:14:31.265
             No!
     You haven't seen it.

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:35.870
      Oh, boy.

01:14:38.775 --> 01:14:40.107
       ( JESSICA GASPS )

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.743
   What! Why did you do this?

01:14:42.779 --> 01:14:45.580
   I had Ian Carter help me sell
   that photo to the tabloids...

01:14:45.615 --> 01:14:47.114
       along with the story that
       we're dating again.

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:48.616
       Why?

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:52.186
     Because, everybody wants to
     know who J-Mac is dating.

01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:53.521
            And now, that bunch
            of photographers...

01:14:53.556 --> 01:14:58.559
         is following me around
                  and not Matt.

01:14:58.595 --> 01:15:03.197
          And we're headed back
          to LA in the morning.

01:15:03.233 --> 01:15:08.436
A huge part of me wishes that
 this could actually be true.

01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:13.474
       But just because I don't
              make you happy...

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:16.244
      doesn't mean I don't want
               you to be happy.

01:15:19.716 --> 01:15:21.916
Vince, I don't know what to say.

01:15:21.951 --> 01:15:24.352
                   Dinner?

01:15:24.387 --> 01:15:26.787
Hey, how about, Merry Christmas?

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:29.657
Merry Christmas, Vince.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:32.260
         Merry Christmas, Jess.

01:15:33.763 --> 01:15:35.463
               I'm gonna go.

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:48.242
                         Hey.

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:53.981
           Looks like it worked.

01:15:54.017 --> 01:15:57.251
Yep, we are paparazzi free.

01:15:59.422 --> 01:16:01.322
              May I have a seat?

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:03.224
           Go for it.

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:08.496
         What is that?

01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:10.331
   It's a present... for you.

01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:13.034
           For me?
            Mm-hm.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:15.269
   Goodness.

01:16:20.777 --> 01:16:21.943
        It's beautiful.

01:16:21.978 --> 01:16:24.979
             Yeah... it is.

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:27.281
There's something else in there.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:36.791
     It's a photo release.

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:41.228
It says that you're okay with me
displaying this in a gallery.

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:44.398
 There's one in Chicago that
    wants me to do a show.

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:47.835
 Well, I don't have a pen, so--

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:50.338
       There's one in the bag.

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:52.106
   Of course, there is.

01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:55.776
You were certain I was gonna
sign this, weren't you?

01:16:55.812 --> 01:16:57.612
            Mostly hopeful.

01:16:58.915 --> 01:17:01.582
    You are something else.

01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:04.318
            Thanks.

01:17:14.297 --> 01:17:15.563
    Hey, come on, we gotta
          get going.

01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:17.365
 We're gonna miss the festival.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:20.968
  Hey, you can't be looking
        at this stuff.

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:22.436
                  Why not?

01:17:24.507 --> 01:17:26.273
 It's grown-up stuff.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:29.977
   It's not like it's real.
 Jessica doesn't love Vince.

01:17:30.013 --> 01:17:31.879
     And you know that how?

01:17:31.914 --> 01:17:33.314
     Can you keep a secret?

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:35.383
  Of course, I can. What's up?

01:17:35.418 --> 01:17:39.520
It's what I asked Santa for...
   for you to fall in love.

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:42.556
     With Jessica?

01:17:42.592 --> 01:17:46.594
No. Santa must have just figured
that part out on his own.

01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:49.363
     But... you love her, right?

01:17:53.236 --> 01:17:54.835
     It's not that simple.

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:56.470
            Shouldn't it be?

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:13.487
         Hey! Wait up!

01:18:13.523 --> 01:18:15.322

          we ready?

01:18:29.739 --> 01:18:33.808
     Stay here... for Christmas.

01:18:33.843 --> 01:18:35.576
 Look, we've been making this
much harder than it has to be.

01:18:35.611 --> 01:18:37.645
   I've been making it much
  harder than it has to be.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.413
 I was just so worried about
  keeping things the same...

01:18:39.449 --> 01:18:44.051
and I couldn't see that things
   could be much better...

01:18:44.087 --> 01:18:46.854
                if they changed.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:48.422
       [BARBARA] Jessica?

01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:52.093
           Matt, I--

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:57.565
Look, I know it's tricky with
your career and with Vince...

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.434
I don't know how it's gonna--
     we'll figure it out.

01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:02.603
         I mean, we have to try.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:08.309
           Jessica, I'm falling
              in love with you.

01:19:08.344 --> 01:19:11.278
                           I am.

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:15.883

         Okay, ready?

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:37.805
         And... action!

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.174
  You can stay here. You can
        stay with me.

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:41.509
  There's nothing here for me.

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:43.043
  I'm here. Isn't that enough?

01:19:43.079 --> 01:19:44.912
    There's no such thing
   as a Christmas miracle.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:49.150
  There is, if we make them
     happen. I love you.

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:50.518
        And I love you.

01:19:51.988 --> 01:19:54.355
          I do, but--

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:05.599
   But maybe that is enough.

01:20:07.737 --> 01:20:12.006
    Wow, I forgot what it
    was like to be loved.

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:15.643
 What it's like to feel like
   I was part of something.

01:20:15.678 --> 01:20:19.380
     Part of a community.
      Part of a family.

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:22.950
     I spend so much time
    keeping people out...

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:26.987
  that I forgot what it was
    like to let people in.

01:20:27.023 --> 01:20:30.457
 This is when we're supposed
to be with the people we love.

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:33.694
    That's what Christmas
       is really about.

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:36.230
         Ask me again.

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:38.199
    Ask you-- ask you what?

01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:40.501
There's only one thing I want
 for Christmas and that's...

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:44.171
   for you to ask me again.
  Don't plan, don't think...

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:46.440
           just act.

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:48.809
        Ask me to stay.

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:52.680
 I will ask you over and over
      and over again...

01:20:52.715 --> 01:20:55.015
     will you stay with me?

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:56.350
             Yes!
             Yes?

Oh my gosh, that was incredible!

01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:07.194
  She just improvised, all--
     that was incredible.

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:08.929
     Wow, wow, okay, but--

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:11.665
          let's do it again,
          but this time--

01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:14.468
        this time I think you
        should kiss me.

01:21:14.503 --> 01:21:17.371
      I think it should
       end with a kiss.

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:20.207
