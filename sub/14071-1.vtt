When you address the crowd today,
make sure that you thank the Mayor

02:37.449 --> 02:39.405
I said he doesn't do speeches.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.781
Anyway, the point is,

03:26.123 --> 03:31.368
many of you have had tremendous impact
on the success of this fine establishment.

03:33.380 --> 03:37.965
But, true to form, only one man in particular
has had the most impact.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.381
He is a friend, a foodie, a businessman.

He is the league's most fearsome teddy bear,

-You've arrived.
-l'm doing okay.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.393
I don't think I'll ever have
a 40-story building like you.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.444
-You know I like to cast a long shadow.
-Yeah.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.773
If I wasn't so enamored
with representing star athletes like yourself,

04:45.994 --> 04:47.450
I might run for president.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.243
I might move to fucking France.

04:49.331 --> 04:53.040
Well, you better stop shaving down there
because they like it hairy.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.462
Sorry about bringing the Sizz along.

but he's my favorite party companion.

-to get an edge, Andre.
-That's it.

Got to roll. Got the Governor waiting.

What's up, big dog?
Hey, how you doing, man?

-Hey, buddy.
-Spencer's taking the town by storm.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.833
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you put him on your show?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.657
You know what, man?
We've been friends for, what, 10 years?

05:35.752 --> 05:37.868
-Yeah.
-That's the only thing he won't do.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.578
Yeah, yeah, we'll do it. We'd love to.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.664
We're not gonna do it.
No, I'm terrible at press.

about derivatives, l'll bail you out.

You afraid I'm gonna get
caught with my pants down?

to attract female clients.

pants down though, I'm charging you extra.

-lt's coming out of your account.
-Yeah, work it out.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.372

You ain't got no date, Dennis.
Your woman put you on the street.

Bet your ass I'm bringing one tomorrow.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.683
I don't know why the fuck
you even want to go, Dennis.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.227
There's no DJ, no dance floor,

Look, I'm glad you cleaned up your image,

06:54.080 --> 06:55.820
stayed out of trouble, had an All-Pro season.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.657
But shit's gotten dull
since you decided to grow up.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.832
You should try it.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.161
-Thirty-six degrees.
-Yeah.

to horses now, right?

-Always was a thoroughbred.
-l've recovered the clean way.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.101
Became a law-abiding citizen
and earned every dollar I got coming.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.182

that money truck any day now.

-Beep-beep.
-Right.

-Hey, man. Look at this.

-Kiki. What a pretty baby.

-How you doing, sweetie?
-Hope y'all don't mind.

Oh, no, no, no, it's no trouble at all.

why you need me out here.

live here in Miami, Glazed and Confused.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.446
I'm your host Jay Glazer.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.157
Spence, tried to get you out here a bunch
as a football player,

08:22.252 --> 08:24.709
but now different role as a ﬁnancial advisor.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.332
Your star is on the rise again.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.288
We ’re trying to make
good things happen for our clients.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.589

08:30.135 --> 08:31.841
-Well, what...
-We manage football players

08:35.015 --> 08:37.176
(CHUCKLES) We handle finances.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.349
-We put together deals.
-Like Suh Casa.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.676
-Great name, by the way.
-Thank you.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.261
-Ceviche, not so much.
-(LAUGHS)

08:43.356 --> 08:45.392
The primary goal of the company

08:45.483 --> 08:48.270
is just to make sure that
the players have the attention that they need

08:48.361 --> 08:51.353
and make sure that they have
the financial security come retirement.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.814
And, more importantly than that,
once the pads come off,

08:53.950 --> 08:55.781
the quality of life should only be on the rise.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.030
With that, we will switch gears
and go to a little football here.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.032
Another strip-o-g ram.
He loves them, by the way.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.114
I hope it's a Ray Lewis strip-o-gram.
That would be insane.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.324
You're close. It's his former teammate.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.536
Somebody who asked to come on the show
the other night at your little shindig.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.292

in the National Football League,

09:12.010 --> 09:12.999
Whoo!

09:13.094 --> 09:15.176
Look at him on his little scooter over there.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.967
-What's up, big dog? How you doing, man?
-What's up, Jay?

09:18.850 --> 09:20.010
Thank you forjoining us.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.137
Calm down, Joe.
Ain't gonna be no stripping here today.

09:22.812 --> 09:23.847
That's lucky for us.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.803
One thing you forgot to mention

09:26.024 --> 09:27.730
in the difference between
me and old Strasmore here.

09:27.817 --> 09:28.806
What's that?

09:28.943 --> 09:31.901
When I get back, I'm still gonna be
one of the best linebackers in the league.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.813
Why do you guys have so much animosity

09:34.908 --> 09:36.523
for two guys who played
on the same side of the ball?

09:36.618 --> 09:38.154
You're the one who wanted
to come on the show.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.364
We talk trash to each other,
but it's all part of the game.

09:40.455 --> 09:43.743
Bullshit. Truth be told,
I wouldn't even have a problem with you

09:43.833 --> 09:45.414
if you didn't post that shit on Twitter
back in the day.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.038
No, no, that was a complete accident.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.164
Twitter was new at that time.
l was just getting the hang of it.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.463
-Plus I got these big-ass thumbs.
-(LAUGHS)

09:52.550 --> 09:54.336
You posted some asinine shit

09:54.427 --> 09:57.214
about me being more concerned
with my stats than I was winning.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.051
That was totally meant
to be a private message

10:01.142 --> 10:02.552
-just between me and you.
-Oh!

10:02.852 --> 10:04.353
-Just between me and you.
-Oh, okay.

10:04.479 --> 10:08.063
But truth is, you do hype your stats
a lot all the time.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.685
Well, you can check the standings, old man.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.186
Yeah, we both got rings,

10:11.778 --> 10:13.814
but I'm the only one left
still chasing number two.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.112
That's very clever and under 140 characters.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.365
Comedian, everybody.
Showtime at the Apollo over here.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.121
(LAUGHS) No, look, at the end of the day,
there's gonna be a time when

10:22.205 --> 10:23.661
you're gonna be retired
and you can't play anymore.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.830
What are you gonna do?
You gonna go back to school?

10:25.917 --> 10:27.953
You already got a PhD in talking shit.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.039
Oh, Shit! Oh, Shit!

10:31.548 --> 10:34.005
Our boy just put the verbal smack down
on Sizzle.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.878
Hey, that's the Spencer we love.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.459
-Come on, man.
-Come on, baby.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.006
Hey, Spencer.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.587
What are you doing to us, Larry?

10:40.682 --> 10:41.842
A lot of mouths to feed this off-season.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.173
Where ’s ownership on this?

10:43.268 --> 10:44.883
We're eye to eye. Not a lot of wiggle room.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.181
Let's hear your first offer. Wait, hold up.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.979
Let me get my bottle of champagne ready.
All right, go ahead.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.852
Twelve million over two years.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.149
Six of it's guaranteed,

10:53.236 --> 10:55.272
and we’ll add performance and
team-based incentive.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.070
Are you fucking kidding me?
Twelve over two?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.864
-Plus incentives.
-lncentives are gravy.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.283
The guy deserves at least
10 a year for three, all right?

11:02.370 --> 11:04.031
Why don't you drive on over to Ricky's house

11:04.122 --> 11:05.612
and start packing his bags
for him right now?

11:05.707 --> 11:07.572
-I knew you wouldn't be happy.
-/ am miserable.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.077
What are you guys doing over there?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.501
-Jason.
-Don’t you fucking "Jason” me, all right?

11:13.256 --> 11:15.963
and I'm sure as fuck not bringing
this bullshit offer to my client.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.750
Find the money or I'm putting Ricky on tour.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.336
And something happened
to piss you off, too,

11:21.431 --> 11:24.138
because you got up
and fought the entire Ravens batch.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.762
Their fullback tried to cut block me
and tried to end my career.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.018
-Who do you think told him to do it?
-Shit, it wasn't me.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.641
"That one's for Sizz, bitch."

11:31.232 --> 11:32.733
Yeah, were his exact words.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.682
Eeeh.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.523
And as always, his mouth wrote a check
that his ass couldn't cash.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.696
-Bullshit.
-If I were your financial manager,

11:39.824 --> 11:42.031
I would tell you to shut it for once
and just play ball.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.734
You know what, Strasmore?
You forget about getting in the Hall.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.029
You were a dirty player,
and you was weak as fuck.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.704
Wow, I'm a fucking dirty player?

11:48.791 --> 11:50.952
That's a lot coming
from the dirtiest player in the game.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.535
Maybe if you're lucky,
they'll put your washed-up ass

11:53.630 --> 11:55.120
in the Asshole Accountants' Hall of Fame.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.877
But let's just be honest,
you're just as overrated at your newjob

11:57.967 --> 11:59.002
as you was at your last one.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.424
Wow, overrated? I'm an asshole?

12:00.511 --> 12:02.968
Over-fucking-rated.
You need to turn your fucking hearing aid up

12:03.056 --> 12:05.092
or come closer so I can speak it to you clearly.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.424
-|'|| be happy to come closer by the way.
-No, no, no, Spence, Spence.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.644
You know it's not the time or the place.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.059
It is the time and the place.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.886
Hey, sit... Spence, Spence, Spence, Spence!

12:12.023 --> 12:14.184
-Spence, Spence, Spence!
-Oh!

12:14.317 --> 12:16.478
What the fuck, Spence?
I don't need ratings this bad!

12:16.569 --> 12:17.649
Roll it!

12:17.820 --> 12:20.027
-Come on, come on. Stop!
-SPENCER: Sizz, you want some of this?

12:20.114 --> 12:22.491
JAY: Somebody get him off him.
Get him off him now.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.490
(BLEEPING ON TV)

12:24.577 --> 12:25.987
Spencer done lost his shit.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.161
JAY: Come on, Sizz, get the...off him.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.075
Ain't he a little too old for this kind of thing?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.372
Are you out of your...mind?

12:31.459 --> 12:33.165
You know what
Harbaugh’s gonna say to you?

12:33.253 --> 12:34.959
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

12:35.171 --> 12:38.004
That was way better
than talking about derivatives.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.501
Fucking Sizzle.

12:39.592 --> 12:44.131
Oh, God damn it, I'm jacked up right now.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.962
Is this what the adrenaline thing's like?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.055
Man, | feel like getting hammered right now.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.178
Motherfuck me!

12:50.270 --> 12:51.976
You all right?

12:52.063 --> 12:55.180
Yeah, yeah, fucking fantastic, Joe.

12:55.483 --> 12:59.101
Really. It was a great idea
and I'm glad I agreed to do it.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.607
I'll call you tomorrow. Fuck!

13:02.573 --> 13:04.404
(PANTING)

13:07.036 --> 13:08.446
All right, Dolphin fan all your life?

13:08.538 --> 13:09.653
-Hell, yeah.
-All right, good man.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.829
There's a logo on there. I like that.
There you go.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.453
Jackie and Tamika. Great meeting you.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.832
-Thanks.
-Hey, stay away from football players.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.292
-Okay.
-(HORN HONKS)

13:21.217 --> 13:22.753
Hey, baby.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.085
Hey. One second.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.882
Hell of a day, fellas.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.467
-Yeah.
-All right, now.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.307
Coach, I guess I'll be
seeing you at mini-camp.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.938
-Uh, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.934
Speaking of which, you got any idea
when Siefert and Berg are making calls?

13:42.280 --> 13:44.566
-Shouldn't be long.
-lt's gonna be a great year.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.491
I can feel it. Be so nice
to go out on another championship.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.819
Elway style, you know? Give me some.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.290
-Huh.
-Should be a great season.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.705
-All right.
-Take care, Dwight.

13:54.876 --> 13:58.289
Urn, probably gonna be some changes
this summer.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.663
-What do you mean?
-Well, they'll talk to you about it.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.464
ljust didn't want you walking into a buzz saw.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.251
You're a good man.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.129
Bye, Kiki. See you later.

14:09.223 --> 14:13.262
(BLUESY MUSIC PLAYING)

14:24.447 --> 14:26.904
-Morning, Sofia.
-Good morning.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.989
(EXHALES)

14:29.619 --> 14:31.826
Hey, Spencer.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.406
Old man's here to see you.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.287
Okay.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.621
Maybe I'll come back.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.870
MR. ANDERSON: Spencer, get in here!

14:43.841 --> 14:46.127
(CHUCKLES) There he is.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.961
Good morning, Mr. Anderson.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.924
Love what you've done with the place.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.256
Ah, thank you. Thank you.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.137
You know, that ball you're holding
is a collector's item.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.217
Really?

14:56.312 --> 14:59.054
Coach Gruden gave me that
2002 NFC Championship game.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.684
-Did he?
-Yeah.

15:04.195 --> 15:07.403
Did Gruden also teach you
to go ape-shit on Jay Glazer's show?

15:07.490 --> 15:09.697
-l was ambushed.
-Real|y?

15:10.118 --> 15:11.983
You were having a conversation on television.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.989
People do that 24 hours, seven days a week.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.241
They don't go physically attacking each other

15:16.332 --> 15:18.163
unless it's Jerry Springer.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.742
(DOOR SLAMS)

15:21.879 --> 15:24.165
I trusted you with this division, Spencer,

15:24.257 --> 15:27.545
and all you've got to show for it
is one new client and a restaurant.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.218
It's not enough. Can I tell you something?
It's not enough.

15:32.682 --> 15:36.891
This football code of ethics of yours,
it's costing me business.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.560
I got multiple calls from New York. Multiple.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.723
If it's one thing I fucking hate,
it's calls from New York.

15:42.817 --> 15:46.935
I moved to paradise to get away
from those assholes in New York.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.192
I understand. I'm sorry.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.614
-I know it was a bad look, Mr. Anderson.
-Yeah.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.738
And it's why I didn't want to
go on the air in the first place.

15:54.829 --> 15:58.242
And you were the one who put me up to it.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.584
Are you blaming me
for you acting like a psychopath?

16:00.668 --> 16:01.999
No, no.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.666
Our registration is in jeopardy now.
Did you know that?

16:05.756 --> 16:08.748
I did, and I apologize
for embarrassing the company,

16:08.843 --> 16:10.583
embarrassing myself, embarrassing you.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.968
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

16:13.723 --> 16:14.712
(SCOFFS)

16:14.891 --> 16:18.554
You can't act on every little impulse you have.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.930
You represent something more now, okay?

16:21.022 --> 16:24.435
Something more sophisticated.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.065
You're the boss here.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.767
Of all these people.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.444
They look up to you. They follow you.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.648
So stop acting like a caveman
and show some...

16:33.743 --> 16:34.732
(SIGHS)

16:34.952 --> 16:36.533
Show some leadership.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.696
Fuck!

16:46.756 --> 16:48.212
JASON: | get it. I get it.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.541
That is great to hear.
You have a wonderful day.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.297
(LAUGHS) All right.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.424
Do me a favor. Stab me in the face with this.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.506
-Please.
-What's up?

16:58.601 --> 17:01.092
Dolphins, they're close
to being done with Ricky.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.393
-You better call him.
-What, and ruin the guy's birthday?

17:07.777 --> 17:09.142
What is wrong with you, Spencer?

17:09.237 --> 17:12.445
The subtle nuance of client management
used to be your best weapon.

17:12.532 --> 17:16.400
Now you're trying to blow up Ricky's day,
settle old scores on TV.

17:16.494 --> 17:17.574
I don't know who you are.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.449
-Hey, Sizzle had it coming.
-You don't actually believe that.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.950
He's been talking shit for years.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.407
Exactly, he was talking trash.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.710
You went after him like a mad dog.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.379
Have you ever heard of transference?

17:30.466 --> 17:33.299
-Only in banking.
-It goes something like this.

17:33.386 --> 17:37.550
Every time I scream at my therapist,
he tells me I'm angry at my mother.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.847
You are angry at your mother.
She's dating a 15-year-old.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.970
Right, which is why I screamed at him.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.269
But he says I'm not really screaming at him,

17:45.356 --> 17:47.221
I am actually screaming at her.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.898
Do you hear yourself right now?
It's psychobabble.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.068
That fight wasn't about Sizzle.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.736
-Well, it wasn't about my mother.
-It was about Andre.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.485
See, he's the one that convinced you

17:56.576 --> 17:58.567
to gamble on that godawful real estate deal,

17:58.661 --> 18:01.198
forced you to play an extra year
in the league just to get out of the red.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.662
Look, I hate to pick at an old wound.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.957
I'm just saying if there's somebody
that you need to be going after,

18:08.004 --> 18:09.039
it ain't Sizzle.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.916
How much you gonna charge me
for this right now?

18:11.007 --> 18:14.625
First session is free.
Second time, we can negotiate.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.838

18:20.016 --> 18:23.008
We want bottles of Perrier-Jouet over here.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.718
And we want a caviar bar over there.

18:25.813 --> 18:29.772
Now, ltold these ladies
we don't want any Mozart or Vivaldi jams.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.645

They call me TTD because it's time to dance.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.996
Unh! Unh! Let me clear my throat.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.588
Whoo, boy, you looking fresh.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.420
Uncomfortable, but fresh.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.633
Shit, I'm glad you think so.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.548
I got a Tom Ford
waiting for your ass upstairs.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.008
Man, don't make me do that, please.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.552
I ain't having you look like a hobo
in front of the team owner.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.507
Get your black ass upstairs
and apply some soap.

I’m here with Miami Dolphins
wide receiver Alonzo Cooley,

19:13.277 --> 19:15.393
who moments ago got a brand-new deal.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.069
Alonzo, how’d it feel to get that call?

19:17.239 --> 19:18.695
It was bananas.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.319
Listen, when the owner’s on the line,

19:20.409 --> 19:21.819
a thousand different thoughts
run through your mind.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.402
Least of which
is a brand-new $12 million deal.

To everybody at the organization,
I’m very happy with this blessing.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.036

They gave Cooley your money
on your birthday?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.342
That's fucked up, man.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.839
Don't take it personal, Richard.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.762
I thought I was finishing my career in Miami.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.841
Man, you're just a rental to them, man.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.927
They got no real love for you.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.646
I mean, that's what your family is for, right?

19:52.733 --> 19:55.975
So, forget all this grown-up party stuff, man.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.026
Your life gonna change for the better.

19:58.114 --> 20:01.106
So, let's take this party to the Funhouse.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.149
Yeah.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.905
No, y'all gonna get me in trouble.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.782
-Yeah, baby.
-This mean I ain't got to wear a suit, right?

20:08.124 --> 20:09.660
(MUSIC PLAYING)

20:33.023 --> 20:35.275
Hey, man, I'm waiting on the Kool—Aid man
to crash through the house.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.645
-Oh, yeah.
-(LAUGHS)

20:37.862 --> 20:39.648
Y'all want some of this diabetes, boys?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.855
Man, this shit will rot your teeth out.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.361
But it'll get you nice and fucked up,
and that's what you want.

20:44.452 --> 20:45.817
You got dental, right?

20:46.203 --> 20:47.739
I mean, I brush twice a day

20:47.830 --> 20:50.446
and a little bit of floss, but I don't...
What do you mean?

20:50.666 --> 20:52.167
Your boy ain't got no dental plan?

20:53.419 --> 20:55.626
Dude, without dental hygiene,
you ain't got shit.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.999
-Hey, man.
-What's he paying you?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.463
Hey, Nate, man, come taste
some of this punch real quick.

21:00.551 --> 21:03.634
-Don't mind if I do, man. Set me up, man.
-Yeah.

21:03.929 --> 21:07.513
Well, in Canada it's free.
Is that what you mean?

21:26.869 --> 21:27.858
You talk to him yet?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.361
No, he's too busy dry-humping the talent.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.493
Let's not disrupt that groove.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.166
-Siefert called.
-What'd that asshole have to say?

21:36.253 --> 21:38.665
You know, honestly, the guy is dead to me.

21:38.756 --> 21:41.042
-Yeah, me, too.
-Yo, Spence.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.839
Yo, what's up, J? All right.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.171
Man, fucked up Rick didn't get paid, man.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.593
-Yes.
-What's happening, 14?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.762
-What's up, Greg?
-Team's talking mutiny.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.514
-Nice.
-JASON: Mutiny?

21:50.601 --> 21:52.762
-Mutiny.
-Don't worry about it. We'll handle it.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.138
We appreciate that, boys. Have fun.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.970
GREG: See you, Spence.
14: Later.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.771
God damn. Fucking guy's
following me around like the herp.

22:01.862 --> 22:05.025
-Yeah, I invited him.
-You invited Sizzle?

22:05.115 --> 22:07.106
Thought it'd be good for you
to work things out, you know?

22:07.243 --> 22:11.407
As much as I enjoy watching Ricky regress,
I'd much rather watch you progress.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.737
Mmm.

22:14.750 --> 22:15.865
You overestimate me, buddy.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.917
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

22:30.224 --> 22:31.839
-Yo, T.
-Yeah?

22:31.934 --> 22:33.845
I'll bring out the sculpture.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.597
Grab my fun bag.

22:35.938 --> 22:36.973
You want the fun bag?

22:37.064 --> 22:39.020
-Grab the fun bag.
-You want the fun bag.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.439
Grab the fun bag.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.442
(COUGHS)

22:46.740 --> 22:48.401
Look who just rolled in with his crew.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.692
Jesus, did he get bigger overnight?

22:50.786 --> 22:53.653
-You should bail, huh?
-I'm not gonna fucking bail. Fuck that.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.033
You want all these people
with their camera phones

22:56.125 --> 22:58.616
to witness World War III
at Ricky Jerret's birthday party?

23:00.004 --> 23:01.540
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

23:10.139 --> 23:11.845
-What are you doing?
-l'm gonna go over there.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.139
No. Come on, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.727
-Hold this for me.
-No.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.051
I'm just gonna talk.

23:17.146 --> 23:20.434
You could wear your watch while you... Shit!

23:20.983 --> 23:23.269
RICKY: Right here, right here, right here.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.192
You ain't had nothing like this, huh, pop?

23:25.571 --> 23:27.152
You ain't had nothing like this, pop.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.442
I mean, that's beautiful. That's beautiful.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.148
Happy birthday to me.

23:33.287 --> 23:34.823
Hey, there's your boy.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.496
Sizz, can I talk to you a minute?

23:43.631 --> 23:45.917
What you want, Spence?
Want me to whup your ass again?

23:46.008 --> 23:47.839
I don't want to throw down
with you again, man.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.417
Shouldn't have gone after you
in the first place,

23:49.511 --> 23:51.672
but it's those old habits, you know?

23:51.889 --> 23:54.426
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, you ran me my fade and all,

23:54.516 --> 23:56.643
but I almost fucked my foot up again
fucking with you.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.393
-And even Roger called me.
-Roger called you?

23:59.813 --> 24:01.553
-Yeah.
-Oh, man.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.558
Hey, but it felt pretty good mixing it up, right?

24:06.820 --> 24:07.809
Yeah, it did.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.941
Yeah, it's been a long time
since I hit somebody.

24:10.032 --> 24:11.397
If you're feeling like you have a little bit left,

24:11.492 --> 24:14.074
maybe get your ass back on the football field
and we can do it again there.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.493
No fucking way, big boy. (LAUGHS) No.

24:16.705 --> 24:20.664
I just came over here to tell you man-to-man
we're one and the same.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.333
Why don't we bury this and just move on?

24:27.049 --> 24:28.255
Fuck it, man. We good.

24:28.342 --> 24:29.798
-We're good?
-We're good.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.342
-All right. You have fun tonight.
-All right.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.215
You need anything, you call me.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.295
All right.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.052
-Bal| so hard.
-Bal| so hard.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.011
-My man.
-All right.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.138
Ball so hard.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.726
(BUZZING)

24:41.814 --> 24:43.520
Stand back. Stand back.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.818
Come on! Come on!

24:56.912 --> 24:58.823
-Ah!
-(CHEERING)

24:58.914 --> 25:02.623
-Yeah!
-Happy birthday.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.998
-You see? That wasn't so hard.
-It's a walk in the park.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.961
I thought you guys
were gonna murder each other.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.128
That's the old Spencer.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.707
The new and improved Spencer
believes in second chances.

25:11.802 --> 25:12.882
Not really.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.841
I'm gonna sign Sizzle
and I'm gonna take the rest of Andre's clients.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.223
