WEBVTT

00:02.055 --> 00:03.488
So I'm on the plane. We left late.

00:04.814 --> 00:08.568
Pilot says, "We're going to be making
up some time." Isn't that interesting?

00:08.735 --> 00:09.929
They just make up time.

00:10.095 --> 00:11.892
That's why you have to
reset your watch.

00:12.295 --> 00:14.331
Of course when they say
they're making up time...

00:14.495 --> 00:18.010
...obviously, they're increasing
the speed of the aircraft.

00:18.175 --> 00:21.087
Now my question is,
if you can go faster...

00:21.255 --> 00:24.133
...why don't you just go
as fast as you can...

00:24.295 --> 00:25.853
...all the time?

00:26.015 --> 00:29.724
Come on. There's no cops up here.
Nail it. Give it some gas.

00:29.895 --> 00:31.965
We're flying.

00:36.215 --> 00:38.809
Travelling, of course,
is the best education.

00:38.975 --> 00:40.169
You know, last year...

00:42.015 --> 00:46.167
...I was ill for 40, 45 countries...

00:46.335 --> 00:50.214
...and I would've gone to more,
but I'd just got a puppy.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.570
And he was too young
to take with me.

00:52.735 --> 00:55.169
But not now.
I won't travel without him.

00:55.335 --> 00:57.724
- Is he on the plane now?
- Oh, yes.

00:58.855 --> 01:01.289
Yes, he's in
the baggage compartment.

01:01.455 --> 01:04.845
I don't know why they won't
let him sit up here with me.

01:05.015 --> 01:07.654
He's a lot better behaved
than most of the dregs...

01:07.815 --> 01:10.124
...you find onboard here.

01:12.815 --> 01:14.533
You have any pets?

01:14.695 --> 01:16.128
Just my next-door neighbour.

01:16.295 --> 01:17.523
Well...

01:17.695 --> 01:20.004
...you are missing out
on a relationship...

01:20.175 --> 01:24.566
...that could enrich your life in ways
that you never even thought possible.

01:24.735 --> 01:27.886
How about picking up their...?
You know.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.966
You find that enriching?

01:32.815 --> 01:35.170
- What's the matter?
- Oh, I'm feeling a bit...

01:35.335 --> 01:36.814
...queasy.

01:38.295 --> 01:40.934
Sir, we're gonna make
an emergency landing in Chicago...

01:41.095 --> 01:42.926
...and get you to a hospital.

01:43.455 --> 01:45.411
My dog.

01:45.575 --> 01:46.974
What about my dog?

01:47.135 --> 01:48.454
You have a dog?

01:48.615 --> 01:50.492
Do you know anyone
on the plane, Mr. Palone?

01:55.735 --> 01:57.726
Jerry.

01:58.375 --> 01:59.694
How you feeling?

01:59.855 --> 02:02.494
Would you take care of Farfel?

02:03.495 --> 02:04.723
Farfel?

02:04.895 --> 02:07.693
It's his dog. We're landing in
Chicago to get him to a hospital.

02:07.855 --> 02:11.484
- Could you take his dog to New York?
- The dog?

02:11.895 --> 02:14.363
- The dog?
- I'm sure it's only for a day or two.

02:14.695 --> 02:16.447
But, you know...
What if, you know...?

02:16.615 --> 02:19.004
Give me your address
and phone number. I'll call you.

02:19.495 --> 02:20.974
The dog?

02:25.295 --> 02:26.694
Let go, Farfel.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.493
Let go. Give me that.

02:28.655 --> 02:31.727
Give me that sneaker,
you stupid idiot.

02:33.335 --> 02:34.848
Shut up!

02:35.855 --> 02:37.083
So, what would you do?

02:37.255 --> 02:39.974
It's only been three days.
I'm sure he's gonna call.

02:40.775 --> 02:43.209
Stop it! Shut up!

02:44.775 --> 02:47.335
Do you believe this?
Do you believe what I'm dealing with?

02:47.495 --> 02:49.326
I got a wild animal in the house.

02:49.495 --> 02:52.965
He'd deranged. Maybe he's got
rabies. I can get lockjaw.

02:53.815 --> 02:56.454
- lf only.
- Look at this place.

02:57.615 --> 02:59.048
He's going everywhere.

02:59.215 --> 03:02.412
I can't go out of the house at night.
I haven't performed in three days.

03:02.575 --> 03:04.884
This will be my first night out
since I got back.

03:05.055 --> 03:07.967
Hey, when you walk him, do you...?

03:08.775 --> 03:10.003
Do I what?

03:10.695 --> 03:13.050
Do you pick it up?

03:14.615 --> 03:16.731
Yes, I pick it up.

03:16.895 --> 03:19.170
- You pick it up?
- Well, you have to.

03:19.335 --> 03:22.054
Oh, boy, would I love to see that.

03:24.575 --> 03:26.088
Shut up!

03:26.255 --> 03:28.450
Shut up, Farfel! Stop it!

03:28.615 --> 03:30.048
I don't know what to do.

03:30.215 --> 03:33.048
What if I take it to the pound,
then the guy shows up?

03:33.215 --> 03:35.649
You should call the airline.
They might know where he is.

03:35.815 --> 03:38.852
No, I tried. They don't know anything.
You gotta put the syrup in first.

03:39.015 --> 03:41.210
- No, milk.
- I'm telling you. The guy's a drunk.

03:41.375 --> 03:43.331
He's probably on a bender.

03:44.055 --> 03:46.011
What is a bender anyhow?

03:46.175 --> 03:49.406
I don't know. They drink and they
bend things at the bar. I don't know.

03:51.055 --> 03:53.250
I can't believe he hasn't called.

03:53.415 --> 03:54.973
Two hundred seats on a plane...

03:55.135 --> 03:58.571
...I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack
and his dog Cujo.

04:00.775 --> 04:02.003
Shut up!

04:02.175 --> 04:04.484
One more day,
and you are pound-bound!

04:05.095 --> 04:07.006
Hey, I'm sorry. I can't
watch the dog tonight.

04:07.175 --> 04:09.166
- Why?
- We're going to the movies.

04:09.335 --> 04:10.973
We're gonna see
Prognosis Negative.

04:11.135 --> 04:13.091
I can't. I gotta get this Ellen
out of my life.

04:13.255 --> 04:15.894
- You're breaking up?
- Oh, yeah.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.329
The sooner the better.
I can't wait to do it.

04:18.495 --> 04:20.769
You know some people
you worry about whether or not...

04:20.935 --> 04:24.052
...you're gonna hurt their feelings?
With her, I'm looking forward to it.

04:24.215 --> 04:25.614
Boy, I'd like to get it on video.

04:25.775 --> 04:27.652
Watch it in slow motion
and freeze-frame it.

04:31.215 --> 04:33.649
Kramer, I don't know how you
lasted as long as you did.

04:33.935 --> 04:35.163
You didn't like her?

04:35.335 --> 04:37.644
If you could see her personality...

04:37.815 --> 04:39.965
...it'd be like one of the
Elephant Man exhibits...

04:40.135 --> 04:42.808
...where they pull off the sheet
and everyone gasps.

04:42.975 --> 04:45.728
I can't believe someone
hasn't killed her yet.

04:46.175 --> 04:47.608
How come you never said anything?

04:47.775 --> 04:50.369
You can't tell someone how you feel
about their girlfriend...

04:50.535 --> 04:52.287
...till after they stop...
- I tell you.

04:52.455 --> 04:54.525
You. I'm talking about people.

04:56.455 --> 04:58.207
Are we still going
to the movies tonight?

04:58.375 --> 05:01.367
No, I can't. I gotta watch Farfel.
You and George can go without me.

05:01.815 --> 05:04.090
- Just me and George?
- Sure.

05:04.255 --> 05:05.529
But we need you.

05:05.695 --> 05:07.287
What do you need me for?

05:08.535 --> 05:10.173
Because.

05:10.335 --> 05:14.647
- Yeah?
- Prognosis Negative.

05:15.375 --> 05:18.128
Because I relate to George
through you.

05:18.295 --> 05:19.853
We're more like...

05:20.015 --> 05:23.803
...friends-in-law. Besides, we said
we'd see Prognosis Negative together.

05:23.975 --> 05:26.045
Can't you put some newspapers
down or something?

05:26.215 --> 05:29.810
No, I can't trust him. He gets insane.
I won't enjoy myself.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.923
That's right, Farfel,
I'm talking about you!

05:33.575 --> 05:36.089
Just me and George alone?

05:37.055 --> 05:41.333
Let's go, people. Let's go.
It's Prognosis Negative time.

05:41.735 --> 05:43.168
I can't go.

05:43.535 --> 05:46.527
- You can't go? Why not?
- Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.

05:46.895 --> 05:50.092
- I thought Kramer was watching him.
- He's breaking up with his girlfriend.

05:50.255 --> 05:52.132
What's the problem?
Just put newspaper down.

05:52.295 --> 05:54.331
No, I don't want that smell
in the house.

05:54.495 --> 05:56.725
- You spritz a little Lysol on it...
- No.

05:56.895 --> 05:58.374
It's like BO and cologne.

05:58.535 --> 06:02.687
They combine forces into some kind
of strange mutant funk.

06:02.855 --> 06:04.129
So we're not going?

06:04.295 --> 06:05.853
Nah. You two go.

06:09.735 --> 06:11.487
You still wanna go?

06:12.415 --> 06:14.326
Do you?

06:14.655 --> 06:16.088
If you want.

06:16.855 --> 06:18.686
- It's... It's up to you.
- Go ahead.

06:19.775 --> 06:24.644
Well, I really wanted to see
Prognosis Negative with Jerry.

06:24.815 --> 06:27.283
You wanna see Ponce de Leon?

06:27.455 --> 06:29.571
Ponce de Leon?

06:29.975 --> 06:31.328
Okay.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.443
- You sure you don't wanna go?
- I want to, but I can't.

06:34.615 --> 06:36.685
Oh! I tell you what.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.892
How about if I come back here first
and I clean everything up?

06:40.055 --> 06:42.728
And I open up the windows,
and if you're still not satisfied...

06:42.895 --> 06:45.887
...we switch apartments for the night.
- No.

06:47.335 --> 06:49.565
- What about this...?
- Forget it.

06:49.735 --> 06:51.771
Go ahead. You'll have a good time.

06:51.935 --> 06:54.688
- I know. It's not that.
- I just want you to go.

06:55.055 --> 06:57.091
Well, thank you very much.

06:57.735 --> 07:01.091
I'm telling you, one more day,
stink breath!

07:01.255 --> 07:03.644
On my block, a lot of people
walk their dogs...

07:03.815 --> 07:07.171
...and I always see them walking
along with their little poop bags...

07:07.335 --> 07:10.054
...which to me is just
the lowest function of human life.

07:10.215 --> 07:13.730
If aliens are watching this
through telescopes...

07:13.895 --> 07:16.773
...they're gonna think the dogs
are the leaders.

07:17.375 --> 07:20.094
If you see two life forms,
one of them is making a poop...

07:20.255 --> 07:23.167
...the other one's carrying it for him...

07:24.135 --> 07:26.695
Who would you assume
is in charge?

07:33.895 --> 07:35.567
So how long did you live there?

07:36.095 --> 07:37.892
About three years.

07:40.015 --> 07:41.573
That's pretty long.

07:45.255 --> 07:47.564
- It's not that long, really.
- Yeah.

07:49.055 --> 07:50.613
- Do you...?
- So...

07:52.775 --> 07:55.448
- And then you came here.
- Yeah.

07:58.055 --> 08:00.489
So I've been here about six years.

08:02.735 --> 08:06.205
'86, '87, '88, '89, '90...

08:06.375 --> 08:08.605
...'91.

08:10.295 --> 08:11.569
Yep.

08:11.735 --> 08:13.009
Bad dog.

08:13.175 --> 08:14.369
Bad dog!

08:14.535 --> 08:16.127
You go outside!

08:16.295 --> 08:18.172
Outside!

08:18.335 --> 08:20.690
What do you want from me? Tell me.

08:20.855 --> 08:22.811
Money? You want money?

08:22.975 --> 08:24.613
I'll give you money. How much?

08:24.775 --> 08:28.927
I must have been out of my mind.
Look at you.

08:29.095 --> 08:31.655
Why don't you do something
with your life?

08:31.815 --> 08:36.126
You sit around here all day.
You contribute nothing to society!

08:37.255 --> 08:39.644
You're just taking up space!

08:40.575 --> 08:43.885
I mean, how can I be
with someone like you?

08:45.255 --> 08:46.768
Wouldn't respect myself.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.286
I like herbal tea.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.725
Chamomile's good.

08:57.015 --> 08:58.846
Lemon Lift.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.206
Almond Pleasure.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

09:16.815 --> 09:19.329
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.

09:21.455 --> 09:24.128
- Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
- Yeah.

09:24.295 --> 09:27.571
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.

09:27.735 --> 09:30.329
Jerry doesn't know
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.

09:31.895 --> 09:33.886
- You don't tell him?
- No.

09:34.055 --> 09:36.285
And you should see him.
Man, he gets all hyper.

09:36.455 --> 09:38.332
He doesn't even know why.
He loves it.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.089
He walks around going,
"God, I feel great!"

09:42.575 --> 09:45.089
- You don't tell him?
- No.

09:46.775 --> 09:48.925
- That is so funny.
- I know.

09:49.335 --> 09:50.688
Have you ever seen him throw up?

09:54.935 --> 09:56.334
Please!

09:57.255 --> 09:59.166
Please!

10:00.335 --> 10:01.893
I take it all back!

10:02.055 --> 10:04.615
Everything. I take it all back!
Every word!

10:04.775 --> 10:06.686
I love you!

10:07.535 --> 10:09.366
I love you!

10:10.455 --> 10:13.731
I can't live without you!
I'll do anything!

10:17.495 --> 10:19.486
That's right. Gavin Palone.

10:19.655 --> 10:22.249
What? You're sure?

10:22.415 --> 10:23.928
He was released on Monday?

10:24.095 --> 10:26.051
Last Monday?

10:26.895 --> 10:29.363
Did he leave a phone number
or address?

10:29.895 --> 10:31.692
Unbelievable.

10:32.495 --> 10:34.963
Well, thank you. Thanks.
Thanks very much.

10:35.655 --> 10:39.091
That's it, Farfel. Party's over.

10:39.255 --> 10:43.965
Start packing up your little squeeze
toys, buddy boy. You're checking out.

10:47.535 --> 10:50.368
It was weird because George
and I get along so great...

10:50.535 --> 10:51.763
...in so many situations...

10:51.935 --> 10:54.449
...but this was the first time
we went one-on-one.

10:54.615 --> 10:57.413
One-on-one's a whole
different game. Can't pass off.

10:58.615 --> 11:01.812
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable
was when we were making fun of you.

11:05.295 --> 11:08.765
Hello. Boy George, about time.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.607
Beautiful. How soon?

11:10.775 --> 11:12.288
Okay, here's the plan:

11:12.455 --> 11:16.289
We take the dog to the pound,
we go right to the movies.

11:16.455 --> 11:18.810
Right. You, me and Elaine.

11:19.335 --> 11:21.087
Yes, all three of us.

11:21.975 --> 11:24.045
I am going.

11:24.215 --> 11:26.524
Okay, see you in five minutes.

11:34.095 --> 11:35.733
- What?
- Do you have to?

11:35.895 --> 11:38.693
What am I supposed to do?
I don't want to do it.

11:38.855 --> 11:40.766
I like dogs.

11:40.935 --> 11:43.085
I'm not sure this is a dog.

11:44.015 --> 11:46.131
You know the guy might have
just lost your number.

11:46.295 --> 11:48.604
I'm in the book,
and I have a machine.

11:48.775 --> 11:52.131
Jerry, do you know what they do
to dogs at the pound?

11:52.295 --> 11:55.651
They keep them there for a week.
If nobody claims them, they kill them.

11:55.815 --> 11:57.089
Really?

11:57.255 --> 11:59.007
How late are they open?

12:04.455 --> 12:06.446
- What?
- What is it?

12:06.895 --> 12:09.250
I went back with Ellen.

12:10.375 --> 12:11.888
- That's great.
- Great.

12:13.455 --> 12:14.968
- Terrific.
- Yeah.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.126
I really think you guys
are good together.

12:17.295 --> 12:21.254
Yes. She understands you,
and she is not demanding.

12:21.415 --> 12:25.169
Do you think that I forgot
what you two said about her?

12:25.335 --> 12:27.803
- We're just trying to be supportive.
- Yes.

12:27.975 --> 12:29.727
- We knew you were upset...
- From now on...

12:29.895 --> 12:32.614
...when we pass each other,
I don't know you, you don't know me.

12:33.255 --> 12:35.723
Oh, Kramer. We didn't mean it.

12:35.895 --> 12:38.534
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting my pot.

12:39.335 --> 12:41.724
- Kramer, we like her.
- Kramer...

12:43.775 --> 12:46.130
What did we say that was so bad?

12:46.295 --> 12:51.289
I believe I referred to her personality
as a potential science exhibit.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.494
I said, " How come
no one's killed her?"

12:56.535 --> 12:57.729
- Well.
- Well.

12:57.895 --> 12:59.647
Probably shouldn't have
said anything.

12:59.815 --> 13:02.375
I mean, everybody knows
the first breakup never takes.

13:04.855 --> 13:08.450
- Yeah?
- Prognosis Negative.

13:10.935 --> 13:15.406
Great. Okay, Farfel,
put your shoes on.

13:16.615 --> 13:18.765
Jerry, can't you just give it
one more day?

13:18.935 --> 13:21.449
- It's not his fault.
- It's not my dog.

13:21.615 --> 13:23.492
I don't know where
this booze hound is.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.694
All right, I tell you what.

13:26.855 --> 13:29.289
How about if you and George
go to the movies...

13:29.455 --> 13:31.013
...and I stay here
and watch the dog?

13:31.175 --> 13:33.643
I can't let you do that.
What about Prognosis Negative?

13:33.815 --> 13:35.726
We'll see it Sunday.

13:36.735 --> 13:39.693
Tonight's the night, right?
Prognosis Negative.

13:40.335 --> 13:42.451
I'm not going.
I'm gonna watch the dog.

13:42.975 --> 13:44.693
- What does this mean?
- Well...

13:44.855 --> 13:49.087
...we'll go see something else tonight.
We'll see Ponce de Leon.

13:49.255 --> 13:52.133
What is with this dog? I thought
we were taking it to the pound.

13:52.295 --> 13:53.933
She talked me into one more day.

13:54.095 --> 13:55.733
Talk. I'm going to the bathroom.

13:55.895 --> 13:58.329
Jerry, how long are you
gonna be in there?

13:59.335 --> 14:02.168
I don't know, regular human time.

14:02.335 --> 14:04.724
Why don't you wait
and go at the movies?

14:06.775 --> 14:09.528
- Why shouldn't I go here?
- Well, you know.

14:09.695 --> 14:12.448
Sometimes it's good to get there
and make sure you get seats...

14:12.615 --> 14:14.048
...and then go to the bathroom.

14:14.215 --> 14:16.365
- And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
- Yeah.

14:18.695 --> 14:21.255
Oh, yeah, George. Urinals are fun.

14:23.015 --> 14:24.926
- Can I go?
- Hey, go.

14:25.095 --> 14:27.814
- Who's stopping you?
- What, are you doing me a favour?

14:29.095 --> 14:31.655
Like we care if you go
to the bathroom.

14:37.415 --> 14:39.371
- How's it going?
- Good.

14:41.415 --> 14:43.485
- You?
- Things are good.

14:57.375 --> 15:00.447
- Boy, he takes such a long time.
- I know.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.726
You know what he does
in there? He gargles.

15:03.895 --> 15:05.726
Jerry gargles?
That why he takes so long?

15:05.895 --> 15:07.886
Yeah, he does it
like six times a day.

15:08.295 --> 15:10.650
- How come we never hear him?
- Because he does it quiet.

15:10.815 --> 15:13.693
He does it quiet. Lookit...
Just like this. Watch.

15:19.495 --> 15:22.168
Wait, wait. Did you ever
see him throw up?

15:23.255 --> 15:25.246
We talked about that already.

15:29.575 --> 15:31.611
I have nothing to say
to anybody anymore.

15:32.255 --> 15:34.485
I'm so uninteresting.

15:34.655 --> 15:36.134
I'm think I'm out of conversation.

15:36.535 --> 15:38.765
So why do you call me
six times a day?

15:39.575 --> 15:41.406
All I know about is sports. That's it.

15:41.575 --> 15:43.725
No matter how depressed,
I can always read sports.

15:43.895 --> 15:46.489
I could read the sports section
if my hair was on fire.

15:47.695 --> 15:50.334
You know what,
Ponce de Leon is sold out.

15:51.855 --> 15:54.164
It is. Oh, yeah, you're right.
What else is playing?

15:54.335 --> 15:56.405
Nothing except Prognosis Negative.

15:57.775 --> 16:00.084
Boy, I know she really wants
to see that with me.

16:00.255 --> 16:01.893
Give me that jacket, mud face.

16:02.055 --> 16:03.807
This is not Seinfeld
you're dealing with.

16:03.975 --> 16:06.967
When I get through with you,
you'll be begging to go to the pound.

16:09.455 --> 16:10.808
Shut up.

16:11.615 --> 16:12.968
Shut up!

16:13.895 --> 16:15.613
Hello?

16:16.295 --> 16:18.729
No. Who's calling?

16:21.495 --> 16:24.328
Oh, my God. The dog guy.

16:24.895 --> 16:26.613
Well, where have you been?

16:27.335 --> 16:29.803
Yeah? Well, you better pick up
your dog tonight...

16:29.975 --> 16:32.125
...or he has humped his last leg.

16:35.175 --> 16:37.609
I could understand if there was
something else playing...

16:37.775 --> 16:39.572
...but it's this or nothing.

16:40.015 --> 16:42.654
- I don't know what to do.
- What is this saving movies thing?

16:42.815 --> 16:45.170
- Something's playing, you go.
- I know. I know.

16:45.335 --> 16:46.654
So we're gonna do nothing now?

16:46.815 --> 16:48.453
- This is crazy.
- It is kind of silly.

16:48.615 --> 16:51.004
- Of course it is.
- I mean, it's just a movie...

16:51.175 --> 16:53.814
- Exactly.
- It's not like she's in the movie.

16:53.975 --> 16:55.169
Right.

16:55.335 --> 16:57.849
We're supposed to ruin the night
because she wants to see it?

16:58.015 --> 16:59.687
If I could have seen it
with her, fine.

16:59.855 --> 17:02.244
But I can't control these
circumstances and schedules...

17:02.415 --> 17:04.804
...and people's availabilities.
- She'll still see it.

17:04.974 --> 17:07.728
- You're not stopping her...
- How does sitting next to a person...

17:07.895 --> 17:09.806
...in a movie theatre
increase the enjoyment?

17:09.974 --> 17:11.965
You can't talk during a movie.

17:14.214 --> 17:15.443
This is stupid. Come on.

17:15.615 --> 17:17.013
- Let's just go.
- Good.

17:17.415 --> 17:20.134
- Saving movies.
- Ridiculous.

17:20.295 --> 17:22.762
Two for Prognosis Negative.

17:25.015 --> 17:27.926
- I'm in big trouble.
- Oh, you're dead.

17:30.615 --> 17:32.731
Bell's Palsy.

17:32.895 --> 17:36.774
The entire side of...
Of my face...

17:36.935 --> 17:39.165
...was paralysed.

17:39.335 --> 17:40.927
Farfel.

17:41.975 --> 17:44.853
You know, I couldn't... I couldn't...
I couldn't even feed myself.

17:45.015 --> 17:47.290
I was completely incapacitated.

17:47.815 --> 17:49.373
Quiet, Farfel!

17:49.535 --> 17:50.763
- Farfel.
- It's interesting...

17:50.935 --> 17:52.448
...because I called the hospital...

17:52.615 --> 17:54.526
...and they said you were
released on Monday.

17:54.935 --> 17:57.324
Yes, that's true...

17:57.495 --> 18:02.808
...but then, see, I was taken
to the Bell's Palsy Centre.

18:03.495 --> 18:05.486
In... In Rockville.

18:05.655 --> 18:08.249
Absolutely first...
First-rate facility.

18:08.415 --> 18:11.088
Top... Top-notch physicians.

18:11.535 --> 18:13.969
Hey, come on. Come on.
Get off me.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.444
He won't hurt you. He's just playing.

18:16.735 --> 18:18.214
Now you keep that mutt
away from me.

18:18.375 --> 18:21.731
Mutt? I'll wager his parents
are more pure than yours.

18:23.015 --> 18:24.607
Kramer, are you coming?

18:24.775 --> 18:27.448
- Oh, hi, Ellen.
- Get in here.

18:31.655 --> 18:34.488
Listen, it's been a pleasure
taking care of your dog for a week...

18:34.655 --> 18:36.532
...but if you don't mind...

18:36.695 --> 18:40.608
Prediction: You'll be calling me to ask
if you can come and visit him...

18:40.775 --> 18:42.493
...before the month is out.

18:43.135 --> 18:46.969
Prediction: I never see you
or him again for the rest of my life.

18:52.615 --> 18:54.207
We made plans.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.452
Why don't we just rent a movie?

18:56.615 --> 18:59.288
I thought you wanted to see
Prognosis Negative.

18:59.455 --> 19:04.404
No. It's supposed to be
really bad. Really bad.

19:04.575 --> 19:07.294
I mean, it's long. There's no story.

19:07.455 --> 19:11.812
It's so unbelievably boring...
I heard. I...

19:13.175 --> 19:15.131
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.

19:15.295 --> 19:18.367
Well, George told me
the whole story, line for line.

19:18.535 --> 19:21.971
I almost feel like I've seen it already
and walked out on it.

19:22.135 --> 19:26.253
Wait. George saw the movie? I saw
him yesterday. He didn't mention it.

19:26.815 --> 19:28.567
You and George got together?

19:28.735 --> 19:32.125
Yeah. I wanted to talk about how
we had nothing to talk about.

19:33.975 --> 19:35.169
Hello.

19:35.335 --> 19:36.609
Hi, hi, hi.

19:36.775 --> 19:38.003
What's up?

19:38.175 --> 19:39.654
Well, you were right.

19:39.815 --> 19:41.726
- About what?
- Ellen.

19:41.895 --> 19:44.455
We broke up again.

19:45.655 --> 19:47.088
Too bad.

19:47.255 --> 19:49.894
I thought she was the one.

19:51.215 --> 19:53.251
I'll bring back the pot.

19:54.175 --> 19:55.813
Okay, come on. It's movie time.

19:55.975 --> 19:58.045
- Hey, what are you gonna see?
- Prognosis Negative.

19:58.215 --> 19:59.933
- That's supposed to be great.
- It's not.

20:00.095 --> 20:03.007
- Well, how do you know?
- I have an instinct for these things.

20:03.175 --> 20:06.645
I had a parakeet when I was a kid.
That was the only pet I really enjoyed.

20:06.975 --> 20:08.567
We used to let him out of his cage...

20:08.735 --> 20:11.169
...and he would fly around.
And my mother had built...

20:11.335 --> 20:14.532
One entire wall of our living room
was mirrored...

20:14.695 --> 20:16.731
...she felt this gives you
a feeling of space.

20:16.895 --> 20:19.045
Have you ever heard this
interior-design principle?

20:19.215 --> 20:21.445
The mirror makes it seem like
you have another room.

20:21.615 --> 20:23.014
Who walks up
to a mirror and goes:

20:23.175 --> 20:26.133
"Hey, look. There's a whole
other room in there.

20:26.855 --> 20:29.574
There's a guy in there,
looks just like me"?

20:31.655 --> 20:34.692
But the parakeet will fall for this.
You let him out. He flies around.

20:34.855 --> 20:38.211
Bang! With his little head.
He would just go:

20:38.375 --> 20:41.685
I'd always think, even if he thinks
the mirror is another room...

20:42.055 --> 20:46.253
...why doesn't he at least try and
avoid hitting the other parakeet?
