00:04.772 --> 00:06.774
Previously on E.R.:

00:06.774 --> 00:08.542
Oh, uh, Dr. Kovack,
I'm Eve Payton.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.443
Our new nurse manager.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.112
It's "Kovach."

00:11.112 --> 00:13.047
Then maybe you
can educate the nurses

00:13.047 --> 00:14.348
about inferior
alveolar dental blocks.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.749
What?

00:15.749 --> 00:18.152
Is there some sort of history
between you

00:18.152 --> 00:19.287
and Dr. Kovac?

00:21.122 --> 00:22.356
I don't think it's appropriate

00:22.356 --> 00:23.757
for the two of you
to work together.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.459
That's two less
than I'm already doing,

00:25.459 --> 00:27.528
which I can't afford,
and I'll never see my kid.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.270 --> 00:40.374
1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.409
What are you doing?

00:41.409 --> 00:42.510
Counting.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.245
6,000...
Yes, that part I get.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.848
The time between the lightning
flash and the thunderclap

00:47.848 --> 00:49.450
tells you how far away
the storm is.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.618
( thunder cracks )

00:50.618 --> 00:51.852
Getting closer.

00:51.852 --> 00:52.853
Oh, that's great.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.388
You going outside?

00:54.388 --> 00:56.190
Yep, drew the short straw
for the coffee run.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.191
Whoa, where do you think
you're going?

00:57.191 --> 00:58.326
We're getting slammed here.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.128
I'm not on for
six minutes.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.829
I'm going out for coffee for
everyone before my shift.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.564
Then be a Flower Drum Song--
and grab me a bear claw.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.132
I'll settle up with you later.

01:05.132 --> 01:06.567
Hi, I'm Dr. Morris,

01:06.567 --> 01:07.635
Chief Resident.

01:07.635 --> 01:08.602
What brings you here today?

01:08.602 --> 01:10.238
Some guy rear-ended me.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.405
Ooh, ouch.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.474
I hope you were driving.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.276
We're getting a little
backed up here, Dr. Morris.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.845
Perhaps we could clear some
of these necks clinically.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.614
We? I think it's best if we left
that decision to the doctors.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.284
Well, if patients meet all five
of the nexus criteria...

01:23.284 --> 01:24.852
And what do you know
about nexus?

01:24.852 --> 01:26.587
As research coordinator
at Emery,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.856
I enrolled 2,000 patients
in the initial study.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.558
That's really interesting, Eve.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.594
Maybe you can bring it up at
your next Nazi nurse rally.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.564
You know, Dr. Morris, my
knowledge of the human anatomy

01:36.564 --> 01:38.866
is so extensive, I could
kill you with this finger.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.234
Somehow I find that
hard to...

01:40.234 --> 01:41.535
Ow!

01:41.535 --> 01:42.570
Whoa.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.172
I saved your life, boss.

01:44.172 --> 01:44.905
I've been telling them
all morning

01:44.905 --> 01:46.507
to keep these floors mopped.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.176
Maybe it's time I fired
some janitorial staff.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.877
Maybe it's time you
cleared some patients.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.679
I'm glad you're back in the
trenches with us, boss.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.647
Yeah, that makes one of us.
What is the problem here?

01:53.647 --> 01:56.217
Oh, we've had like
20 paramedic runs...

01:56.217 --> 01:58.219
Every E.D. in the city
is closed to saturation,

01:58.219 --> 01:59.553
which means we're all open.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.255
Fender-benders are
clogging up the hallways.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.323
I'm not sure they all
need a C-spine film.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.224
Of course not.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.592
Get with it, Morris.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.594
Half these patients
don't even need X rays.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.596
Start clearing necks.

02:08.596 --> 02:09.863
PAYTON:
Alright, so they've
called radiology.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.265
They're going
to send us a tech.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.639
What the hell's your problem?

02:18.639 --> 02:21.275
You can't wait for
a little break...

02:21.275 --> 02:24.278
Crazy bitch!
It's a crosswalk, you asshole!

03:14.995 --> 03:17.298
Diverticulitis grandma is
being admitted to Medicine.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.267
My mandible fracture is going
to the OR with OMF

03:19.267 --> 03:22.936
and Mr. McKay goes home
with rest and ibuprofen.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.272
And on that note,
I'm out of here

03:24.272 --> 03:25.673
with no pass-ons,
thank you very much.

03:25.673 --> 03:26.940
I thought you were going
to help Neela clear some X-rays.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.276
I did.
Now I'm going home.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.577
Doc Rock is going
to help you out.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.279
Sorry, dude, I'm not working
down here today.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.946
I start my Toxicology elective.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.482
Yeah, I picked neurology, I
didn't even get an elective.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.016
That's because you still
need to complete

03:36.016 --> 03:37.485
your pre-hospital care
training requirements.
My what?

03:37.485 --> 03:38.652
Your ride-alongs.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.454
You never did them
as an intern.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.689
And you have 24 hours in
the field with the paramedics.

03:41.689 --> 03:42.990
Well, yeah, I've been
meaning to do that.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.558
Well, come see me
when you do,

03:44.558 --> 03:45.993
and then we'll discuss
your elective options.

03:45.993 --> 03:49.530
Where'd you go
for coffee, Milwaukee?

03:49.530 --> 03:51.332
The doughnuts are soggy.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.800
God forbid you don't
get your morning ration

03:52.800 --> 03:54.435
of deep-fried fat, Frank.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.571
Maybe I can dry them
in the microwave.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.572
You okay?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.007
Yeah.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.509
Nothing a week in
the Bahamas wouldn't cure.

04:01.509 --> 04:02.510
What about you?

04:02.510 --> 04:04.312
Eve stuck me on nights.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.047
Now I get less sleep, less
money and I barely see Alex.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.449
I have to have a baby-sitter
spend the night with him.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.783
What is it about rain

04:09.783 --> 04:11.719
that turns the residents
of this city into idiots?

04:11.719 --> 04:13.354
Tell me about it.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.588
Haleh, what are you
doing here?

04:14.588 --> 04:16.055
Connie's sick, asked
me to cover for her.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.458
I thought I warned you
about your overtime.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.559
I wasn't planning
to be here.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.027
I'm just trying
to help her out.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.394
Well, you should have told her
to call someone else.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.563
So what, you want me

04:22.563 --> 04:23.764
to turn around
and go back home?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.599
Unless you want another
letter in your file.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.670
Have a great day.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.706
Sam, can you cover for me
until I find someone else?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.508
Sam?

04:34.508 --> 04:36.344
Why not? I'm not going
to be home on time

04:36.344 --> 04:37.511
to see my kid
off to school anyway.

04:40.748 --> 04:41.849
Who's this?

04:41.849 --> 04:43.684
Blaire Collins, 29.

04:43.684 --> 04:47.855
Sent in from Lake Shore Gardens
for infection around her G-tube.

04:47.855 --> 04:48.656
Does this hurt, Blaire?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.491
Ma'am?

04:50.491 --> 04:51.725
MAN:
She's in a coma.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.593
Since when?

04:52.593 --> 04:54.495
Six years.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.530
No, come on.
No way. No way, guys.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.831
We don't have the room.

04:57.831 --> 04:58.832
She doesn't need to be here.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.034
They can give her IV antibiotics

05:01.034 --> 05:03.471
and the doctor at the nursing
facility can change her G-tube.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.638
So what are we
supposed to do?

05:04.638 --> 05:05.839
I just told you.
Take her back.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.475
We don't get paid
for round trips,

05:07.475 --> 05:08.376
and we got
another run.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.644
Hey, guys... Hey!

05:10.644 --> 05:12.513
What's wrong?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.548
Nursing home dump.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.716
What else is new?

05:15.716 --> 05:16.684
Come on, I think
Trauma Two's open.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.051
Uh, Sam, check the lobby.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.653
We could use another nurse
in triage.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.055
You've got to be kidding me.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.391
Don't worry about it.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.392
No, this is ridiculous.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.859
Hey... Kerry,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.728
are you going to do
something about this?
About what?

05:27.728 --> 05:29.863
I mean the way she's
managing the staff.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.400
If it's a nursing issue,
it's Eve's rice bowl.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.434
You two work it out.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.704
MAN:
Morning rounds are
at 10:00 a.m.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.507
10:00, 10:00 is good.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.475
We discuss our
toxicology consultations

05:41.475 --> 05:42.643
from the entire county.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.078
You will carry the pager
every third day

05:45.078 --> 05:47.548
and research conference
is Thursday afternoons.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.483
( rattling )

05:51.885 --> 05:54.087
Wow, check it out.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.088
Is it poisonous?

05:55.088 --> 05:56.757
Venomous? Yes.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.460
I'm studying neurotoxic
factors in crotalid venom.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.796
Oh, cool.

06:02.796 --> 06:03.931
Cool.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.800
Please, don't do that.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.169
Your main focus will be
our Poison Control Center.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.671
Calls come in from
both the public

06:10.671 --> 06:12.673
and other health care
facilities.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.141
You'll have online access

06:14.141 --> 06:16.577
to an international
PoisIndex database

06:16.577 --> 06:19.513
and we are here
to back you up.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.581
You're number two.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.751
WOMAN:
Judy Anderson, 31!

06:23.751 --> 06:26.620
Head-on collision;
auto versus cinder block wall.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.622
My baby, Grace, where is she?
She's coming soon, ma'am.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.623
Any belly pain, Judy?

06:29.623 --> 06:30.791
It hurts when I breathe.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.560
Driver with chest pain,
good vitals.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.194
Any victims in
the second vehicle?

06:34.194 --> 06:35.195
Only one car.

06:35.195 --> 06:35.763
They forced me off the road!

06:35.763 --> 06:36.930
Who?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.499
They were driving
like maniacs.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.500
They hurt my daughter.
Where is she?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.168
The baby is
with Rescue 73.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.737
I'll take this one so
you can take the baby.
Uh, sure.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.474
RASGOTRA:
Don't worry. We're going
to take care of both of you.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.509
Nice work.
Is that custom?

06:48.509 --> 06:50.177
Yeah, Spanish Revival.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.745
Ancef's on board.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.481
Watch it, man. This frigging
thing is attached.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.615
I think he missed
the femur.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.849
Looks like he bagged
the femoral artery.

06:55.849 --> 06:56.884
Got a cold foot.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.151
Give him another 50
of fentanyl,

06:58.151 --> 06:59.620
we'll take him upstairs.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.821
I'll be right back.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.627
Dr. Dubenko.
Yeah?

07:06.627 --> 07:08.161
Is everything else okay?

07:08.161 --> 07:10.998
Oh, I think he should be back
to work in a few weeks.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.533
Well, I meant
with you, actually.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.768
Oh.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.604
Um, I know this is
none of my business,

07:16.604 --> 07:19.573
but I was up in oncology last
week with a patient and...

07:19.573 --> 07:20.808
Oh, oh, oh.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.243
I had my annual
PSA screening.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.679
Oh. Duh.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.549
It came back 6.5.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.817
That's a little high.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.586
Needle biopsy showed a
moderately differentiated

07:32.586 --> 07:34.221
prostate cancer.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.723
I'm so sorry.

07:35.723 --> 07:38.726
No, it's okay.
We caught it early, stage T-1.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.562
Good prognosis
with surgery.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.800
I got to get your ischemic
foot boy upstairs.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.702
Um, Lucian?

07:50.571 --> 07:52.840
If you want to talk
with someone,

07:52.840 --> 07:56.944
or have a coffee or something...

07:56.944 --> 07:57.978
Yeah, alright.
Maybe.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.880
That'd be nice.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.649
Okay.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.683
Hey, Frank.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.585
Anything besides
fender-benders?

08:04.585 --> 08:06.554
Well, guy in number four

08:06.554 --> 08:09.990
got scalded while driving by
the hospital by some crazy
broad

08:09.990 --> 08:11.759
who was throwing coffee.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.861
He thought she
was a nurse.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.228
Probably someone from ICU.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.597
They're really wacky up there.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.299
Abby! Chest pain!

08:19.299 --> 08:20.701
When did it start?

08:20.701 --> 08:22.970
Ten, 15 minutes ago.
We came right in.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.572
What does it feel like?

08:24.572 --> 08:26.073
Heavy, heavy here.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.074
Are you on
any medications?

08:27.074 --> 08:28.909
Lipitor and aspirin.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.944
Alright, first day labs,
12 lead, lopressor and nitro.

08:30.944 --> 08:31.945
Got it.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.847
Is he having
a heart attack?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.616
We'll have to look at the EKG
before we can tell you that.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.885
Three-month-old,
rear-seat passenger,

08:37.885 --> 08:39.285
multiple lacs to the head,
face and chest.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.287
She was found
outside the vehicle.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.589
Looked like
she was ejected.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.823
Car seat wasn't anchored down?

08:42.823 --> 08:44.825
Looks that way.
Heart rate is in the 160s.

08:44.825 --> 08:45.693
Access?

08:45.693 --> 08:47.094
Tried twice, IV blew.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.996
Hey, you any good
with a tiny vein?
Maybe.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.598
I'll take that as a yes.

08:50.598 --> 08:51.699
C-spine's clear.
Get her off the board.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.734
Pulse ox 97
on two liters.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.003
Now when you say a truck, do
you mean they were driving

08:56.003 --> 08:57.771
an SUV or a pickup, ma'am?

08:57.771 --> 09:00.908
SUV, it was blue or black.
It was definitely black.

09:00.908 --> 09:01.909
Okay, Judy, we're going
to sit you up.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.811
Ow, my chest!

09:03.811 --> 09:05.713
Did you see the driver or any
of the passengers, ma'am?

09:05.713 --> 09:08.281
There were at least two of them.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.751
The driver was young,
a teenager.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.120
White, black, Hispanic, Asian,
what?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.022
White. I'm not sure
about the passenger.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.056
Lungs are clear.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.958
BP 112/78.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.092
It hurts when I breathe.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.696
Stop.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.932
Okay, Judy, I think you've
broken your breastbone.

09:24.932 --> 09:29.069
Add a sternal view, troponin,
CT of head, abdomen and pelvis.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.938
What else can you tell us
about the vehicle?

09:30.938 --> 09:33.040
There was a bike rack
on the roof.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.642
They tried to force me
off the road.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.877
They wanted to steal my car.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.111
Am I bleeding?

09:38.111 --> 09:39.780
You hit the window.
It's not bad.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.381
Will I need stitches?
Yeah.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.116
Did either of them
have a weapon, ma'am?

09:43.116 --> 09:44.384
I don't know.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.919
It happened so fast.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.822
I just wanted
to get out of there.
Enough for now.

09:48.822 --> 09:49.790
She's had a concussion.

09:49.790 --> 09:50.791
We need to let her rest

09:50.791 --> 09:52.860
before she goes up to the CT.

09:54.327 --> 09:54.995
We're working here.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.664
Sorry, Luka.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.699
We've got a trauma.
We need the room.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.802
Alright, here
we go, gently.

10:01.802 --> 10:02.670
( baby crying )

10:02.670 --> 10:03.704
Lift up the neck.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.373
On my count,
one, two, three.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.908
Here we go.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.677
We're out
of infant C-collars.

10:09.677 --> 10:12.412
Luka do you know if we have
any infant C-collars?

10:12.412 --> 10:14.414
You can use towel rolls.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.783
Airway is patent.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.689
I can't hear breath sounds
with all the crying.

10:21.689 --> 10:22.355
Do we have a sat?

10:22.355 --> 10:23.691
Won't pick up.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.759
KOVAC:
Kid's pink, sat's fine.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.929
24 gauge going on
in the right.

10:28.929 --> 10:29.730
You want me
to take this, Kerry?

10:29.730 --> 10:30.764
I don't mind.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.700
What, you think I'm rusty?

10:32.700 --> 10:36.704
Superficial head
lacs, no step-offs,

10:36.704 --> 10:39.139
left frontal-
parietal hematoma.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.441
Call CT and let them
know we need a head.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.076
Finally calming down.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.713
Or going apnic.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.447
Come on, baby.
Wake up. Wake up.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.116
( baby screaming )

10:49.116 --> 10:51.418
Alright, uh, Inez,

10:51.418 --> 10:52.419
miller one and a 4-O.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.187
She needs a tube.

10:54.187 --> 10:58.759
Kerry, the kid's screaming.
The airway is obviously fine.

10:58.759 --> 11:02.730
She's got a good mechanism for a
head injury and she needs a CT.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.765
So what you're going to subject
her to the risks of intubation,

11:04.765 --> 11:07.100
just to make it easier
for the radiologist?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.769
She'll settle down.
Just give her some time.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.137
She doesn't have time.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.139
Agitation could be an
early sign of head injury.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.742
Or an appropriate response
to a stressful situation.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.877
Babies cry when they're scared.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.879
Thank you, Dr. Kovac,
but this is my patient.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.148
Her mental status
is waxing and waning.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.916
She could go apnic
in the scanner.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.985
You bag her through it.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.820
.5 of versed and vec.

11:26.820 --> 11:30.457
Hold on. You're going to lose
your neuro exam if you sedate.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.893
And watch her bleed
into her brain? No, thanks.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.127
Push the meds, Inez.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.262
She's alert.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.764
Pupils equal, good tone.

11:36.764 --> 11:37.430
Do it now.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.032
.5 versed going in.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.135
Come on, Kerry, we've both
seen enough head trauma

11:42.135 --> 11:43.904
to develop gut feelings
about this.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.774
Yeah, and my gut says intubate.
She needs a tube.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.141
Giving the vec.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.277
Suction.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.045
The scope.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.020
Where are they
taking my daughter?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.288
She's going up to the CT.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.990
But what are
all those tubes?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.157
Why isn't she moving?

12:04.157 --> 12:05.225
The tube helps her breathe.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.894
It's just a precaution.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.129
Sometimes babies have
to be sedated for CAT scans.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.798
It doesn't mean
anything's wrong.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.104
Have the... police
found anything?

12:17.104 --> 12:18.806
It's still early.
They will.

12:21.208 --> 12:24.544
I should have waited...
till it stopped raining.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.113
No one can control
the weather.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.280
The good news is

12:27.280 --> 12:29.817
that your brain and
belly CT are normal.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.151
Unfortunately, you've
broken your breastbone

12:31.151 --> 12:32.920
and we'll need
to monitor your heart

12:32.920 --> 12:34.221
to make sure
it wasn't bruised.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.824
But I didn't have
to go out.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.492
I... I could have waited.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.862
Grace was fussy all night

12:41.862 --> 12:44.832
and sometimes a car ride
settles her down.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.835
I'm gonna numb up the cuts
on your face before I suture.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.569
What am I gonna
tell my husband?

12:49.569 --> 12:53.073
"Need a new car"?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.975
You're going to feel
a little pinprick

12:54.975 --> 12:57.945
and then some burning
before it kicks in.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.853
JERRY:
You have a bunch
of phone messages.

13:05.853 --> 13:09.056
Uh... no, no, no.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.191
Tell Kayson to stop
bothering me.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.993
I'll call Anspaugh back
when I get a chance.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.028
Oh, crap.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.330
Henry's got a birthday
party tomorrow.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.899
Hey, Jerry.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.868
Could you go down
to that toy store

13:20.868 --> 13:22.535
on Michigan Avenue
for me?

13:22.535 --> 13:24.137
You want me to go outside?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.106
Yeah. It's just
a few blocks.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.141
I need a King Funshine.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.943
I'll write it down for you.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.011
In the storm?

13:31.011 --> 13:32.245
What, you afraid you'll melt?

13:32.245 --> 13:33.546
What about
the lightning?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.148
I'm a pretty big target.

13:35.148 --> 13:39.619
Well, then I suggest you try
running in a zigzag pattern.

13:39.619 --> 13:40.988
Dr. Weaver?
Yeah?

13:40.988 --> 13:42.622
The results are back
for that little girl

13:42.622 --> 13:43.891
who ejected from the car.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.158
Is she awake yet?

13:45.158 --> 13:47.027
Not yet, but I'm
gonna double-check.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.896
Hey.
Hey.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.935
Baby's head CT
is negative.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.937
Just some soft
tissue swelling.

13:56.937 --> 13:57.971
Is she awake?

13:57.971 --> 13:59.339
No, she's still sedated.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.174
Then you can't follow
her neuro exam.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.076
She'll wake up
and we'll extubate.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.044
Dr. Weaver?
Yeah?

14:04.044 --> 14:05.245
This is Bradley Anderson.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.047
His wife and daughter
were brought in.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.648
The police said there
was an accident.

14:08.648 --> 14:09.950
Somebody tried
to carjack them?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.051
Yeah, they're doing well.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.953
Come on, I'll
take you to them.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.422
Aren't you two supposed to keep
50 feet apart or something.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.357
Bite me, Frank.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.259
Ask me, you're
better off.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.361
I didn't.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.664
Second EKG is unchanged
and troponin is negative.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.200
He's pain-free after
nitro and metoprolol.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.969
So, he's okay?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.138
Well, it doesn't look
like a heart attack,

14:31.138 --> 14:33.606
but I think he
has unstable angina.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.109
One of the arteries around your
heart may be closing down,

14:36.109 --> 14:37.945
so you're gonna have
to stay in the hospital

14:37.945 --> 14:39.046
for observation
and some more tests.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.347
For how long?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.282
Could be just a day or two.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.352
You okay
with that?
Like I got a choice?

14:45.352 --> 14:48.288
You hang in there.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.090
I'll stop by later if I can.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.292
Um, excuse me.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.063
Excuse me. Hi.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.098
Um, it might be better
if you stayed,

14:58.098 --> 14:59.967
because the cardiologist
is probably gonna have

14:59.967 --> 15:01.969
questions and instructions
for you and your husband.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.637
Oh, I'm not Lee's wife.
I'm his therapist.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.274
Are you a doctor?

15:07.274 --> 15:11.278
I'm his...
satisfaction facilitator.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.981
What is that exactly?

15:13.981 --> 15:16.383
I have a select group
of clients like Lee

15:16.383 --> 15:20.653
who require... something
they're not getting at home.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.456
Something... sexual.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.192
Mm.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.127
See, I provide
the one thing that's missing,

15:27.127 --> 15:28.361
which allows them to live

15:28.361 --> 15:30.030
happily ever after
with their wives.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.231
Really?

15:31.231 --> 15:33.066
Oh, I help women, too.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.104
You call me
if he needs anything.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.438
Okay.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.407
KOVAC:
60cc's of gastrografin

15:40.407 --> 15:42.042
and check the K.U.B.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.376
What's this?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.145
Nursing home dump.

15:45.145 --> 15:49.082
I'm changing G-tubes
on comatose patients now.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.150
How's your M.I.?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.384
Unstable angina.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.153
Just out of curiosity,

15:53.153 --> 15:56.356
what type of guy hires
a satisfaction facilitator?

15:56.356 --> 15:58.025
I believe it's the...

15:58.025 --> 16:00.393
politically correct term
for "call girl" these days.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.494
A smart one?

16:01.494 --> 16:03.163
We have a saying
in Croatia.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.297
( speaking Croatian )

16:04.297 --> 16:06.433
You know, "If it
floats, flies or..."

16:06.433 --> 16:08.035
Fornicates?

16:08.035 --> 16:09.436
Rent it.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.304
Hey, Dr. Kovac.
Hello.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.306
Um, I thought
I might take you up

16:13.306 --> 16:14.341
on that offer for some coffee.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.076
If you got a minute?
Sure.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.577
Um, page me
if you need me.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.182
How many stitches?

16:22.182 --> 16:23.750
Oh, let's see.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.518
There's seven
on the forehead,

16:25.518 --> 16:28.055
five on the cheek,
that's 12 all together.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.722
That's not so bad.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.125
Neela, uh, this is Brad,
Judy's husband.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.330
Hey, baby.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.498
Honey, I'm so sorry.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.466
Oh, come on.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.301
It wasn't
your fault.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.469
The police told me
what happened.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.537
The bastards who did this
should be shot.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.074
No, I tried to get away
and I lost control.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.176
You did everything
you could.

16:49.176 --> 16:52.345
Don't worry, the cops
will get these guys.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.546
Have you seen Grace?

16:53.546 --> 16:56.083
She looks good.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.217
They think she's gonna be okay.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.485
Really?

16:58.485 --> 17:00.320
Uh, we still have
to run a few tests.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.255
Everything looks good,
but as soon as I can,

17:02.255 --> 17:03.190
I'll bring her down

17:03.190 --> 17:04.757
so you can
be with her.

17:04.757 --> 17:05.625
Okay, thanks.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.396
I'm gonna go back
and stay with Grace

17:09.396 --> 17:12.799
until they're ready
to bring her in here.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.767
I love you.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.403
I love you, too.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.114
Your husband seems
like a great guy.

17:27.114 --> 17:30.117
( sobbing )

17:30.117 --> 17:31.118
It's okay, Judy.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.485
Everything's
gonna be okay.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.322
I'm sorry. I'm not
usually like this.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.490
( sobbing )

17:37.490 --> 17:42.229
Okay, well,
the Venus flytrap is nontoxic,

17:42.229 --> 17:44.564
so it's not lethal if ingested.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.434
However, the larger ones
are extremely dangerous,

17:47.434 --> 17:50.803
and have been known to devour
pets and small children.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.273
( chuckles )

17:53.273 --> 17:55.808
No, no, no,
I made that last part up.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.178
( chuckles )

17:58.178 --> 18:01.214
Uh... I'm sorry.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.250
Ma'am, I...

18:03.250 --> 18:05.252
You're absolutely right.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.554
This is not a venue for humor.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.390
I... I understand.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.293
I-I apologize.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.361
You, too.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.631
( sighs )

18:18.631 --> 18:20.367
Do you need any help
with the snakes?

18:27.474 --> 18:29.176
Could have gone
to the cafeteria.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.344
This one.
Their coffee sucks.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.449
Here we go.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.689
Um, you didn't mention
seeing me upstairs

18:42.689 --> 18:44.357
to anyone else
by any chance, did you?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.559
No, no, no.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.894
I mean, I....

18:47.894 --> 18:50.197
I wouldn't have said
anything to you,

18:50.197 --> 18:52.465
but I just thought
maybe you might want

18:52.465 --> 18:53.533
to talk to someone
or something.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.901
Yeah. No, I appreciate
the gesture.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.637
Okay.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.508
So what are your
treatment options?

19:01.508 --> 19:06.479
Well, um, I've opted for
a radical prostatectomy.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.216
My urologist, Dr. Peter Singh,
do you know him?

19:09.216 --> 19:10.917
Uh, no.

19:10.917 --> 19:15.222
He does a, a bilateral
nerve-sparing procedure

19:15.222 --> 19:16.489
for patients with
low volume disease.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.924
Well, that's great.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.327
Unfortunately, even
in the best of circumstances,

19:20.327 --> 19:25.665
there's a 25% chance
of loss of erectile function.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.600
Yeah, then
you're looking

19:27.600 --> 19:32.239
at penile injection therapy,
intraurethral pharmacotherapy,

19:32.239 --> 19:35.342
vacuum erection devices,
or a penile prosthesis

19:35.342 --> 19:36.709
to achieve
an adequate erection.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.381
Why, uh, then the good news is

19:41.381 --> 19:44.417
that-that there's
a 75% chance of success.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.286
Well, the procedure
also eliminates

19:46.286 --> 19:47.687
the ability to ejaculate.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.988
Uh-huh.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.657
But the chance
of urinary incontinence

19:50.657 --> 19:52.925
is relatively low,
so at least I won't be wearing

19:52.925 --> 19:54.627
a diaper or need
an artificial sphincter.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.429
Oh, well, there you go.

19:58.965 --> 19:59.699
Yeah.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.567
Yeah.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.706
It is, um, it's...
it's just, it's....

20:06.706 --> 20:08.575
it's-it's rather daunting,

20:08.575 --> 20:11.944
knowing that you may
never have sex again.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.514
Well, it sounds like
you're in good hands.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.283
Yeah.

20:16.283 --> 20:20.653
Look, um, I know this is, uh,
rather unconventional,

20:20.653 --> 20:22.489
and under different
circumstances

20:22.489 --> 20:25.992
I certainly would have employed
a more traditional approach

20:25.992 --> 20:28.395
with regards to courtship

20:28.395 --> 20:30.963
and romantic
methodology,

20:30.963 --> 20:33.433
and assuredly enjoyed
all the ritual of that,

20:33.433 --> 20:35.535
but given the time
constraints

20:35.535 --> 20:37.804
and obviously what I'm
potentially faced with...

20:37.804 --> 20:39.339
You know, you might
want to just kind of...

20:39.339 --> 20:40.373
Look, look.
Mm-hmm.

20:44.411 --> 20:48.515
If I'm going down,
I want to go down swinging.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.550
And I'd like it to be with you.

20:53.486 --> 21:00.026
So you want me
to sleep with you?

21:00.026 --> 21:01.594
Yes.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.330
Wow, that's something.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.398
That's...

21:08.501 --> 21:11.638
I'm flattered, I think.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.340
Uh, but I, uh...

21:14.607 --> 21:16.543
I can't do that.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.478
No, no. I understand.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.346
Nothing personal.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.781
No, I understand.

21:21.781 --> 21:26.519
Just asking purely from
a scientific approach.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.623
What about after?

21:30.623 --> 21:32.024
After what?

21:32.024 --> 21:34.026
The surgery, to see
if anything still works.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.662
I'm gonna have to take
a pass on that, too.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.064
Yeah.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.499
Abby, you want this?

21:39.499 --> 21:41.067
GSW to the upper
chest!

21:41.067 --> 21:42.769
I gotta....
I better get back.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.471
You want to hop on?

21:44.471 --> 21:47.807
I mean, are you coming
to the, uh, for the...

21:47.807 --> 21:49.642
Place a chest tube,

21:49.642 --> 21:52.612
call me if the initial
output's over 500cc's.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.486
H-How's Grace?

21:59.486 --> 22:01.087
We moved her to one
of our exam rooms

22:01.087 --> 22:02.789
so we're going
to take you to her.

22:02.789 --> 22:03.890
Mrs. Anderson,
I brought some

22:03.890 --> 22:05.592
mug books for you
to look through.

22:05.592 --> 22:08.528
Um, it all happened so fast,

22:08.528 --> 22:10.697
I'm not really sure
what I remember seeing.

22:10.697 --> 22:11.798
Well, take a look.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.400
Maybe a face will
jog your memory.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.603
I can't.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.605
Why don't you give us
a few minutes?

22:18.605 --> 22:19.772
Sure.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.810
I don't want
to look at those books.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.111
You might be able
to identify

22:25.111 --> 22:27.414
the two men who
drove you off the road.

22:27.414 --> 22:28.415
I can't.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.549
Why not?

22:29.549 --> 22:31.818
It was, it was pouring rain.

22:31.818 --> 22:35.755
I could barely see
out the window.

22:35.755 --> 22:39.125
I... I...
The car started to skid.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.561
I don't know,
I saw the wall coming

22:41.561 --> 22:43.730
and I didn't stop,
I just kept driving.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.566
What are you saying, Judy?
What happened?

22:46.566 --> 22:48.868
I...

22:48.868 --> 22:51.838
I didn't know that Grace's
car seat wasn't clicked in.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.574
I would...
I would never do anything

22:54.574 --> 22:58.545
to hurt my child.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.747
Did you do this on purpose?

23:06.753 --> 23:09.689
Sometimes I...

23:09.689 --> 23:11.658
I can't help it.

23:11.658 --> 23:16.496
Sometimes, it's like I don't
know how to snap out of it.

23:16.496 --> 23:20.867
It's like... everything
is coming at me at once

23:20.867 --> 23:26.473
and I just want it
all to go away.

23:26.473 --> 23:27.640
Judy, did you try
to hurt yourself?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.642
I just wanted it to stop.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.217
Do either of you
have a moment?
Shoot.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.786
I think my MVC mom's suffering

23:39.786 --> 23:41.153
from severe
postpartum depression.

23:41.153 --> 23:41.854
Dr. Weaver?

23:41.854 --> 23:42.955
Just one second.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.657
It's the baby.
Grace Anderson.

23:44.657 --> 23:45.992
What about her?
She's waking up.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.560
I thought you might
want to extubate.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.928
Yeah, I'll be right there.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.499
What are her symptoms?

23:52.499 --> 23:54.501
She drove head-on to a wall
with her baby in the car.

23:54.501 --> 23:55.702
I think it was
intentional.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.637
I'd like to put her
on psych hold.

23:57.637 --> 23:58.671
Dr. Rasgotra?

23:58.671 --> 23:59.806
That's the husband.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.775
Uh, get Psych
down here.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.010
Can my wife go home now?

24:04.010 --> 24:05.578
Not yet.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.213
What, you moved Judy
out of the trauma room.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.781
I thought that meant
she was good to go.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.016
We needed to clear the room.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.519
We have to rule out
a cardiac contusion,

24:12.519 --> 24:13.720
so we need to monitor
her heart some more

24:13.720 --> 24:15.254
to make sure
it's not bruised.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.023
For how long?

24:17.023 --> 24:18.224
I'm not sure.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.526
It could be a while.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.863
Mr. Anderson...

24:23.863 --> 24:25.865
does Judy drink alcohol?

24:25.865 --> 24:27.800
No.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.570
I mean, she has a glass
of wine now and then.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.671
Why?

24:31.671 --> 24:33.540
What about drugs?

24:33.540 --> 24:34.741
No.

24:34.741 --> 24:37.243
What's this all about?

24:37.243 --> 24:39.979
Just routine questions
for her chart

24:39.979 --> 24:41.548
to, um, avoid any
drug interaction,

24:41.548 --> 24:42.915
that sort of thing.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.551
Have you, uh,

24:44.551 --> 24:46.819
noticed any change
in her mood lately?

24:46.819 --> 24:47.820
Like what?

24:47.820 --> 24:49.989
She seem depressed?

24:49.989 --> 24:51.791
No.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.894
Any loss of appetite
or trouble sleeping?

24:54.894 --> 24:55.962
You're kidding, right?

24:55.962 --> 24:57.797
We have a three-
month-old baby.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.767
When Gracie doesn't sleep,
none of us do.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.902
Look, the sooner
I can get them both home,

25:02.902 --> 25:04.904
the sooner they can start
getting better.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.573
I don't want to send her home

25:06.573 --> 25:07.974
until I'm sure
there's no danger.

25:07.974 --> 25:10.577
No, of course, you're right.

25:10.577 --> 25:11.844
Thank you.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.083
Dr. Kovac, could you
help me clear some beds?

25:17.083 --> 25:18.284
I thought I was.

25:18.284 --> 25:19.652
Well, maybe
if we work together.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.721
Look, what's going on
in Exam Two?

25:21.721 --> 25:24.591
D.U.B. needs an ultrasound
to rule out fibroids.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.593
Good crits.
Vitals stable.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.861
How about an outpatient scan
and a GYN referral?

25:28.861 --> 25:30.296
Well, if you can
get her in this week.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.865
Done. Okay, next:
Buster Freeman.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.734
Dirty puncture wound
to the foot,

25:34.734 --> 25:36.002
waiting on IV...

25:36.002 --> 25:37.604
Could he sit in
a chair for that?

25:37.604 --> 25:39.005
I mean,
it frees up a bed.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.640
Crystal Maranacchio.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.008
Waiting on an ortho consult.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.843
She's been cleared.
I called the attending.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.011
You what?
That's a new policy.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.779
When we call
for a consult,

25:46.779 --> 25:49.616
the resident has 60 minutes
to respond to the page,

25:49.616 --> 25:50.950
or we call the attending.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.985
All the department heads
signed off on it,

25:52.985 --> 25:56.623
except Psych-- crazy bastards.

25:56.623 --> 25:59.926
Blaire Collins
has been here forever.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.360
I called
the nursing home twice.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.029
They were supposed to be
sending a ride for her.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.030
Well, if they're
not here in ten,

26:04.030 --> 26:06.065
I'm putting her in a cab.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.333
She's comatose.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.902
I was kidding,
Dr. Kovac.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.774
Frank?

26:14.774 --> 26:16.776
Call Blaire Collins'
nursing home again

26:16.776 --> 26:18.778
and tell those idiots
she's been ready to go home

26:18.778 --> 26:20.012
for the last four hours.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.080
Tell them yourself.
I'm busy.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.649
Dr. Kovac?

26:22.649 --> 26:24.116
I think I'm one
of those idiots.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.985
Trish Gorham,
the assistant director

26:25.985 --> 26:28.087
from the nursing home that's
been caring for Blaire Collins.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.889
I didn't mean that...

26:29.889 --> 26:32.158
It's our policy to check on
patients prior to transfer.

26:32.158 --> 26:33.926
I gather she's
well enough to return?

26:33.926 --> 26:36.162
Yeah, she's right
over here.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.797
To be honest with you,
all she needs

26:37.797 --> 26:39.131
is a course
of IV antibiotics

26:39.131 --> 26:40.800
and the G-tube could
have been changed

26:40.800 --> 26:42.068
at her facility.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.069
We're not staffed
as well as the hospital,

26:43.069 --> 26:44.403
and the gastro-neurologist

26:44.403 --> 26:45.905
doesn't come out
to the nursing home.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.740
The earliest I could have
gotten anyone to see her

26:47.740 --> 26:48.941
was in two weeks.

26:48.941 --> 26:49.676
She have any family?

26:49.676 --> 26:51.077
No.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.112
Apparently her mother died
from the crash that did this.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.714
There was a boyfriend,

26:54.714 --> 26:57.684
but he's stopped
coming around years ago.

26:57.684 --> 26:59.085
MAN:
He didn't even try to stop!

26:59.085 --> 27:00.787
Somebody call my son.
I need you to reach my son.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.690
47-year-old victim of
auto-versus-pedestrian.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.158
I just ran out to get
the kids some pizza.

27:06.158 --> 27:07.393
He didn't even slow down.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.961
Systolic only 80
after a liter.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.897
Pulse 140,
pale and diaphoretic.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.032
Ecchymosis across
the abdomen and pelvis.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.201
Four units of O-neg and
prime the rapid infuser.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.836
Am I dying?

27:16.836 --> 27:18.838
No, but you may have
some internal bleeding.

27:18.838 --> 27:21.874
Resps are shallow.
Let's set up for intubation.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.142
How often are you sad?

27:23.142 --> 27:25.144
Uh, not often.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.079
And what makes
you happy, Judy?

27:27.079 --> 27:29.749
Being with my baby
and my husband.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.851
Why are you
asking me all this?

27:31.851 --> 27:33.820
We ask all patients
these questions

27:33.820 --> 27:37.056
to assess mental status
following a head injury.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.992
Well, my mental status is fine.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.128
Really.

27:42.128 --> 27:43.963
Any thoughts about
wanting to hurt yourself?

27:47.066 --> 27:49.068
Uh, not unless you count

27:49.068 --> 27:52.772
wanting to take a carving knife
to my hips.

27:52.772 --> 27:53.973
Do you ever think about
wanting to hurt your baby?

27:56.042 --> 27:58.845
Of course not.

27:58.845 --> 28:01.480
What did you tell him?

28:01.480 --> 28:03.750
Judy, you said you were upset

28:03.750 --> 28:05.918
and that you couldn't
snap out of it.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.854
What are you talking about?

28:07.854 --> 28:09.221
You told me you felt like
everything was coming

28:09.221 --> 28:11.257
at you and that you
wanted it all to stop.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.092
No, no, I said

28:13.092 --> 28:17.029
that I lost control of the car
and I couldn't stop.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.765
You're putting words
in my mouth.

28:18.765 --> 28:19.966
It's not uncommon
for new moms to have

28:19.966 --> 28:21.000
bouts of depression.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.034
The first year with your baby

28:22.034 --> 28:23.469
can be very
stressful.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.004
I'm not stressed
and I'm not depressed,

28:25.004 --> 28:26.238
although I will be

28:26.238 --> 28:28.474
if I have to spend
any more time here.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.777
So stop accusing me
of being crazy

28:30.777 --> 28:32.211
and let me go.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.046
Nobody's accusing you
of anything.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.447
We have to be
extra careful

28:35.447 --> 28:36.916
whenever there's
a child involved.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.785
( sighs )

28:40.820 --> 28:43.790
Look, I appreciate your concern.

28:43.790 --> 28:44.891
Really.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.025
There's nothing wrong with me.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.929
I've had a rough day.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.530
And I just want
to take my baby home

28:51.530 --> 28:53.099
and get some rest.

28:56.268 --> 28:59.071
Well, I hope you have a speedy
recovery, Mrs. Anderson.

29:04.143 --> 29:05.878
So are we good to go?

29:05.878 --> 29:06.946
Uh, not quite,

29:06.946 --> 29:08.214
but you can
go back inside now.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.281
I'll be right in.

29:12.518 --> 29:13.920
She's changed her story.

29:13.920 --> 29:14.954
There are
no vegetative symptoms,

29:14.954 --> 29:16.088
no anhedonia.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.824
She doesn't have
a depressed affect.

29:17.824 --> 29:18.991
In fact, she appears to be
in pretty good spirits.

29:18.991 --> 29:19.959
Well, something
is going on.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.160
She as much as confessed

29:21.160 --> 29:22.929
to deliberately
crashing her car.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.831
But she's not
saying that now.
She's lying.

29:24.831 --> 29:27.233
She's a prime candidate
for severe...

29:27.233 --> 29:28.901
Dr. Rasgotra,
I want to be sure

29:28.901 --> 29:29.836
she doesn't have
postpartum depression

29:29.836 --> 29:30.937
just as much as you do.

29:30.937 --> 29:31.838
But it can be one of
the most difficult

29:31.838 --> 29:33.239
conditions to diagnose.

29:33.239 --> 29:36.008
And if the patient
is in complete denial
or lying to me,

29:36.008 --> 29:39.078
not only can I not tell,
but I cannot hold her.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.914
I gave her every opportunity
to let us know.

29:41.914 --> 29:42.982
I'm sorry.

29:47.954 --> 29:48.988
Whoa.

29:48.988 --> 29:49.856
Need a hand?

29:49.856 --> 29:50.857
I need eight.

29:50.857 --> 29:51.323
Oh, God, it hurts!

29:51.323 --> 29:52.992
What's this?

29:52.992 --> 29:54.526
Driver of our
auto-versus-pedestrian.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.963
The guy ran out in front of me.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.264
Please, give me something.

29:58.264 --> 29:59.999
No neck pain,
no chest pain,

29:59.999 --> 30:02.268
good vitals,
but complains of bilateral

30:02.268 --> 30:05.938
thumb pain.
Look at this.
I can't even make a fist.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.340
And we're out of beds.
Okay, let's park him.
I'll see what I can do.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.942
Thanks.
Dr. Weaver, Psych's

30:09.942 --> 30:11.377
refusing to admit
Judy Anderson.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.880
Psych?
I believe her condition
was a deliberate act.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.015
Yes, I know you suspect
postpartum depression,

30:16.015 --> 30:16.983
but did she admit it?

30:16.983 --> 30:18.017
Practically.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.351
She drove head-on
into a wall.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.220
The baby's seat wasn't
properly anchored.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.289
She's obviously
overwhelmed at home.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.057
ER. Please hold.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.025
Please hold.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.359
Please hold.

30:27.359 --> 30:28.895
Has anybody seen Jerry?

30:28.895 --> 30:30.596
I sent him out
on an errand,

30:30.596 --> 30:33.032
but he should
be back by now.
You sent him out in this?

30:33.032 --> 30:35.134
You don't send Jerry
out in the rain.
I've heard that, too.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.368
Maybe I should
get DCFS involved.

30:36.368 --> 30:37.937
Well, have you talked
to the husband?

30:37.937 --> 30:39.571
Maybe he could
convince her.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.173
A voluntary admission
would be better

30:41.173 --> 30:42.308
for everyone involved.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.943
I'll try.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.978
Frank, where's Jerry?

30:45.978 --> 30:48.180
Dr. Weaver sent him
on an errand.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.115
Oh, no, you didn't.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.382
What is the big deal?

30:50.382 --> 30:52.284
Big man does not do well
in the wet weather.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.120
What the hell does that mean?

30:54.120 --> 30:55.287
Excuse me.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.388
Could you help us
find our dad?

30:56.388 --> 30:58.057
Lawrence Digby.
He was hit by a car.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.959
The doctors are
still treating him.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.327
They said he got hit
while crossing the street.

31:01.327 --> 31:04.063
Yeah, this guy was talking
on his cell phone,

31:04.063 --> 31:05.097
wasn't paying attention,

31:05.097 --> 31:06.265
went right through
the crosswalk.

31:06.265 --> 31:07.199
Come on. I'll take you
back to him.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.400
Sam, you can
go home now.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.202
I've got a float from ICU
coming down.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.204
I'm gonna stay and help
with this guy's kids.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.406
You're welcome to do so, but if
you do, you're off the clock.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.274
Fine with me.

31:15.274 --> 31:16.175
Come on, you guys.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.110
Can I take her home now?

31:18.110 --> 31:20.146
We'd like to keep her
overnight for observation.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.148
Oh, come on. Overnight?

31:22.148 --> 31:23.349
Why?

31:23.349 --> 31:25.384
I think your wife
needs some help.

31:25.384 --> 31:29.088
Believe me, I've tried to talk
her into getting a nanny,

31:29.088 --> 31:31.090
but she doesn't want another
woman raising her daughter.

31:31.090 --> 31:34.093
It makes her feel like she's
less of a mother or something.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.962
I don't mean
that kind of help.

31:35.962 --> 31:39.431
I think Judy needs
some psychiatric help.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.067
What?

31:41.067 --> 31:43.302
Mr. Anderson...

31:43.302 --> 31:44.470
Brad, why don't
we sit down.

31:49.475 --> 31:52.979
It's not uncommon
for new moms

31:52.979 --> 31:54.413
to get overwhelmed
with all the challenges

31:54.413 --> 31:57.216
of child care, especially
in the first year.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.351
So why are you
making a big deal out of this?

31:59.351 --> 32:01.120
Usually, it's short-lived

32:01.120 --> 32:03.389
and goes away after the
baby falls into a routine

32:03.389 --> 32:05.424
and the mom's
hormones stabilize.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.127
But occasionally,
it lasts longer,

32:08.127 --> 32:10.329
becomes more severe,

32:10.329 --> 32:13.732
and develops into something
called postpartum depression.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.434
Yeah, yeah, but that's not Judy.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.170
Judy's not depressed,
not like that.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.439
I mean, sure, she's anxious
to get back to work,

32:20.439 --> 32:22.441
and sometimes she's
a little down about that,

32:22.441 --> 32:25.044
but that's normal.

32:25.044 --> 32:29.015
Purposely trying to hurt
herself and your baby isn't.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.082
What are you talking about?

32:30.082 --> 32:31.250
She had an accident!

32:31.250 --> 32:33.052
Some creep tried
to run her off the road.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.087
I don't think she was
forced off the road.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.155
NURSE:
Dr. Rasgotra,

32:36.155 --> 32:37.423
nosebleed on Coumadin in Two.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.091
Okay.

32:39.091 --> 32:42.394
Please, talk to your wife,
ask her yourself.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.163
Ask her what really happened
in the car.

32:48.034 --> 32:50.036
Sux on board.
Yankauer.

32:50.036 --> 32:53.072
Assist ventilations.
O-neg's going
on the right antecube.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.141
We're gonna need
the rapid infuser.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.508
Curtain Four.
They did an in-service.

32:56.508 --> 32:59.311
I got it.
'Kay, let's take a look.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.148
Sats down to 92.
Turn on the suction.

33:02.148 --> 33:02.748
It's on.
No, it's not.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.483
I have it on high.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.451
KOVAC:
I'm not getting
anything here.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.186
Inez, go next door

33:07.186 --> 33:08.487
and help Dr. Lockhart
with the chest tube.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.056
Okay.

33:10.056 --> 33:11.323
I'm not allowed to work with any

33:11.323 --> 33:13.092
of the nurses now?

33:13.092 --> 33:15.061
The patient is paralyzed.
I can't see the cords.

33:15.061 --> 33:17.196
I need suction.
Hold your horses.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.565
Suction container
wasn't sealed properly.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.569
You're welcome.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.471
Tube.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.140
Found it.
Two units on
the infuser.

33:28.140 --> 33:31.110
Set up for a subclavian.
Okay, bag him.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.480
End tidal CO2 is yellow.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.516
Yellow's good.
I'll be right back.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.385
Alright, hook me up.

33:41.787 --> 33:44.756
O-silk is next?

33:44.756 --> 33:46.358
O-silk. Come on.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.194
Here you go.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.761
And I want to auto-
transfuse this guy.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.297
Okay.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.764
You need a side collector
on the thoraseal.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.366
You know,
just go help Dr. Kovac

33:54.366 --> 33:56.302
with the rapid infuser,
Alright?
No problem.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.770
LOCKHART:
Vaseline gauze, 4X4's
and elastoplast.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.239
What do you need?

34:00.239 --> 34:02.308
Central line,
supraumbilical DPL,

34:02.308 --> 34:04.143
rapid infuser and a t-pod

34:04.143 --> 34:06.112
What's a t-pod?

34:06.112 --> 34:08.246
Fine, I'll get it... again.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.248
What do you want me
to do first?

34:09.248 --> 34:10.248
Find the O-neg.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.783
Everything okay in there?

34:11.783 --> 34:13.319
For the time being.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.321
Call for four units
of type specific.

34:15.321 --> 34:17.255
Soon as I get this up.

34:17.255 --> 34:18.324
Hey, Sam?

34:20.525 --> 34:21.592
Hypotensive pelvic fracture.

34:21.592 --> 34:22.860
He needs the works.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.530
Those are his kids
out there.

34:24.530 --> 34:27.399
Hey, Frank, can you bring
those guys to the Family Room?

34:27.399 --> 34:29.801
Sure. Come on, kids.
This way.

34:29.801 --> 34:30.569
I'll be right in.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.871
Great.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.139
Guide wire?

34:34.139 --> 34:35.306
I'm getting an error signal.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.808
There's not enough
water in the warmer.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.210
( sighs ):
Thanks.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.277
Cordis inducer.

34:42.313 --> 34:45.150
Stitch.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.556
Where's Dori with the T-pod?

34:50.556 --> 34:52.491
T-pods are on
the bottom shelf.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.159
Update his vitals?

34:56.161 --> 34:57.629
Okay, infuser's on.
Looks good.

34:57.629 --> 34:58.664
Cathet...

34:58.664 --> 35:01.567
Pressure's up
to 95 palp.

35:06.238 --> 35:07.839
No gross blood.

35:07.839 --> 35:08.840
PAYTON:
Where do you
need me?

35:08.840 --> 35:09.541
We're all set.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.177
She's good.

35:11.177 --> 35:13.645
Thanks, Sam.
We'll take it from here.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.447
I'll go check on his kids.

35:17.316 --> 35:18.650
BRAD:
She's really not sure
what happened.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.552
She gave herself
a pretty good whack in the head.

35:20.552 --> 35:22.221
We can't do anything

35:22.221 --> 35:23.289
if she doesn't identify
her assailants.

35:23.289 --> 35:24.856
That's okay.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.525
Like I said, she's not sure
what she remembers.

35:26.525 --> 35:29.861
She's not even certain
it was intentional now.

35:29.861 --> 35:33.599
Fine. Let me know if
she changes her mind.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.334
You did the right thing.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.868
The next step is to get
your wife some help.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.437
No. The next step is
for me to take her home.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.406
Mr. Anderson...
My wife is not crazy, okay?

35:40.406 --> 35:41.607
She had an accident.
It happens.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.209
I'd rather she chose to stay,

35:43.209 --> 35:46.245
than have psychiatry put her
on forced hold.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.579
She's gonna be with me.

35:47.579 --> 35:48.580
She's gonna be fine.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.715
Just leave us alone.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.550
I mean it.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.621
Pressure's up to 100
systolic. Crit's 28.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.423
Send another 4 units to angio.

35:57.423 --> 35:58.924
Daddy?

35:58.924 --> 36:00.592
Your dad has
a broken pelvis,

36:00.592 --> 36:03.695
which are the ring of bones
around his waist.

36:03.695 --> 36:06.432
Some of his blood vessels
have also been damaged.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.467
He's bleeding inside.

36:08.467 --> 36:11.370
Can you fix it?

36:11.370 --> 36:14.906
We're gonna try,
but he's lost a lot
of blood already.

36:14.906 --> 36:18.444
It's very serious.

36:18.444 --> 36:20.646
It was supposed
to be me.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.581
I was supposed to go get
the pizza, but I-I...

36:22.581 --> 36:24.550
MAN:
Yeah, it's ridiculous
I'm still here.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.485
I don't know, some pizza guy
ran out in front of me.

36:26.485 --> 36:27.619
Hey, jerk-off!

36:27.619 --> 36:28.654
Jason...

36:28.654 --> 36:29.388
I can't drive for a week.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.590
Jason!

36:31.590 --> 36:33.259
Not that I could anyway--
my car is totaled. Hey!

36:33.259 --> 36:34.526
What was so important

36:34.526 --> 36:35.961
you had to be talking on
the phone while driving!

36:35.961 --> 36:38.364
Come on!
What was so
damn important!

36:38.364 --> 36:39.531
Hey! That's enough!
Hey, come on!

36:39.531 --> 36:40.466
Hey, get that guy
away from me!

36:40.466 --> 36:41.567
Shut up!

36:41.567 --> 36:43.402
Jason, hey, I know you're mad,

36:43.402 --> 36:45.437
but your father's condition
is very serious,

36:45.437 --> 36:47.606
and your brother and sister
need you right now, okay?

36:49.575 --> 36:50.976
Come on, Jason,

36:50.976 --> 36:53.479
I'll take you
to the Family Room.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.749
( sighs ):
Dr. Kovac, one
of your patients

36:57.749 --> 36:59.785
is getting agitated.
Which one?

36:59.785 --> 37:01.587
The girl from
the nursing home.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.754
She's in a coma, Inez.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.390
Not anymore.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.563
Hey?
( weakly ):
Where...

37:11.563 --> 37:14.433
I'm Dr. Kovac.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.835
Wh-Where's my mom?

37:21.307 --> 37:22.574
Okay, keep your hands up
as if you were holding a tray.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.610
( quietly ):
Okay.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.585
( weakly ):
What's wrong with me?

37:37.523 --> 37:38.757
What's the last thing
you remember?

37:42.361 --> 37:44.663
Uh...

37:44.663 --> 37:46.665
My mom and I were going
to the mall...

37:48.534 --> 37:51.337
and it was snowing,

37:51.337 --> 37:52.404
and, um...

37:54.740 --> 37:56.342
Were we in an accident?

37:59.345 --> 38:00.379
Is she okay?

38:04.450 --> 38:08.420
I-I didn't treat her, but, um,

38:08.420 --> 38:09.755
let-let me see
what I can find out, okay?

38:09.755 --> 38:11.723
Yeah. Okay.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.367
How is she?

38:21.367 --> 38:23.535
She doesn't
remember anything.

38:24.636 --> 38:25.771
What are you gonna tell her?

38:25.771 --> 38:27.706
I don't know.

38:27.706 --> 38:30.442
Your mother's dead,
and you've been in a
coma for six years?

38:32.611 --> 38:34.713
How are those kids doing?

38:34.713 --> 38:35.847
They're hanging in there.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.549
I got ahold
of an aunt and uncle.

38:37.549 --> 38:38.684
They're with them right now.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.786
Inez, walk with me.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.054
Do I have to?

38:43.054 --> 38:43.889
I better get into this.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.557
EVE:
I think you have

38:45.557 --> 38:47.493
just fantastic potential,
but in every spare moment,

38:47.493 --> 38:48.794
you've got to be in there
honing your skills.

38:48.794 --> 38:49.795
Got a second?
Not really.

38:49.795 --> 38:51.430
If you're so
concerned

38:51.430 --> 38:52.063
with the efficiency
of this department,

38:52.063 --> 38:53.465
then you need

38:53.465 --> 38:54.132
to allow those of us
who work well together

38:54.132 --> 38:55.401
to continue to do so.

38:55.401 --> 38:56.835
If you're referring to the...

38:56.835 --> 38:58.136
And if you want us to act
like professionals,

38:58.136 --> 38:58.670
then you need to treat us
as such.

38:58.670 --> 38:59.838
Sam...

38:59.838 --> 39:01.072
You saw me in there
with Dr. Kovac.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.474
You saw how well
we work together.

39:02.474 --> 39:02.908
If that doesn't prove
that we can work

39:02.908 --> 39:04.543
the same shift,

39:04.543 --> 39:05.611
then I don't think
you know your job

39:05.611 --> 39:09.481
as well as you
think you do.

39:09.481 --> 39:10.816
Feel better?

39:12.150 --> 39:14.453
FYI: I already
changed the schedule.

39:14.453 --> 39:17.523
You're back on your old shifts
next week.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.090
Thank you.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.759
Don't worry.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.828
When I first started,
I could barely hook up an I.V.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.162
It's all muscle memory.

39:24.162 --> 39:25.664
You'll get it, Inez,
I know you will.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.098
I felt like an idiot.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.166
I didn't even know
what a T-pod was.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.935
Everybody needs help
with stuff.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.437
When you do,
come find me.

39:31.437 --> 39:32.904
Thanks.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.540
Page me when he's
out of surgery.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.575
Will do.

39:36.575 --> 39:37.776
Hello. You're back.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.878
Had a cancellation.
He's this way.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.880
I tried calling Lee's cell,
but he wasn't answering.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.615
Is everything okay?
Yeah, he's doing great.

39:43.615 --> 39:44.750
We're just, uh,
waiting for them

39:44.750 --> 39:46.117
to take him up
to the cath lab.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.586
Ooh, that sounds ominous.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.688
They're going to
do an angioplasty,

39:49.688 --> 39:51.857
which is a procedure
where we

39:51.857 --> 39:53.592
insert a catheter
into a blood vessel in his leg,

39:53.592 --> 39:55.160
thread it up
to his coronary artery,

39:55.160 --> 39:56.595
which is used
to inflate a balloon

39:56.595 --> 39:58.129
that will open up the blockage.

39:58.129 --> 40:00.732
Guess those cheese steaks
caught up with me.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.734
I've been telling him
to eat better for years.

40:02.734 --> 40:03.835
WOMAN:
Lee?

40:05.471 --> 40:07.806
Hey, you! Hi.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.776
This is my... wife, Viv.

40:10.776 --> 40:11.943
Hi.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.747
Hi.

40:15.747 --> 40:16.982
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.216
I've been treating your husband.

40:18.216 --> 40:19.885
Hi.
Everything's okay.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.720
I've got a little blockage,
but they're gonna fix it.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.489
Oh.

40:23.489 --> 40:26.157
I didn't get
your name.

40:26.157 --> 40:27.659
Shawna.

40:27.659 --> 40:28.694
Hi.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.462
And you are...?

40:30.462 --> 40:31.530
Therapist.

40:33.164 --> 40:36.868
From Cardiology.

40:36.868 --> 40:39.204
Really?

40:39.204 --> 40:41.540
Your husband has to
undergo an angioplasty.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.808
That's where we're going to

40:42.808 --> 40:44.543
insert a catheter into a
blood vessel in his leg,

40:44.543 --> 40:45.944
and we're gonna use it
to inflate a balloon

40:45.944 --> 40:48.547
that will hopefully
open the blockage.

40:48.547 --> 40:49.615
( Lee laughs )

40:51.216 --> 40:52.518
Oh.

40:52.518 --> 40:54.252
Okay.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.987
Well, good luck,
Mr. Rappaport.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.889
I have to get back
to my other patients.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.658
It was nice to meet you.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.694
Excuse me for just one second.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.932
( Shawna sighs )

41:06.932 --> 41:07.866
Whoa. That was close.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.234
Mm-hmm.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.703
Thanks. I-I really
owe you one.

41:11.703 --> 41:12.938
Hey, listen,

41:12.938 --> 41:14.906
if you ever need
a sex therapist...

41:14.906 --> 41:17.876
I... I think I'm good. Um...

41:20.211 --> 41:21.279
Now that you mention it,

41:21.279 --> 41:23.682
do you ever do
any pro bono work?

41:23.682 --> 41:24.883
Yes, I spoke to your resident,

41:24.883 --> 41:26.585
and he thought
a hold was unnecessary,

41:26.585 --> 41:27.953
but I disagree,
and all I'm asking

41:27.953 --> 41:30.556
is for a second assessment
from another attending.

41:30.556 --> 41:31.657
Watch it!

41:31.657 --> 41:32.758
No, Dr. Wakita, not you.

41:32.758 --> 41:33.759
Hey, Jerry,
where have you been?

41:33.759 --> 41:35.561
I was getting worried about you.

41:35.561 --> 41:38.564
Everyone was acting as if I'd
sent you out in a hurricane.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.570
Are you okay?

41:50.676 --> 41:53.078
What the hell happened
to King Funshine?

41:53.078 --> 41:54.780
Did you get hit
by lightning again?

41:56.582 --> 41:57.849
He didn't get hit
by lightning.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.052
Here's your change.

42:04.089 --> 42:05.824
Okay. Uh, let's

42:05.824 --> 42:07.826
get you on a
cardiac monitor.

42:07.826 --> 42:08.994
CBC, chem panel, EKG.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.962
CPK, troponin,
myoglobin and UA.

42:10.962 --> 42:12.698
I-I realize that.

42:12.698 --> 42:13.599
I'm sure he is,
but this isn't about me,

42:13.599 --> 42:15.000
him, or even you.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.604
It's about the welfare
of a mother and her child.

42:18.604 --> 42:19.638
You will? Great!

42:19.638 --> 42:21.873
Thank you so much.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.942
Um, psych attending's coming
down to assess Judy Anderson.

42:23.942 --> 42:25.677
If Dr. Wakita asks, you agree

42:25.677 --> 42:26.878
with my postpartum depression
assessment, right?

42:26.878 --> 42:28.647
WEAVER:
Yeah, you got it.

42:33.719 --> 42:35.921
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson,
I have some good news.

42:35.921 --> 42:37.723
One of our attendings
from upstairs has agreed

42:37.723 --> 42:38.824
to come down
and speak with you.

42:38.824 --> 42:39.858
I've seen enough doctors today.

42:39.858 --> 42:41.059
We're
going home.

42:41.059 --> 42:42.661
Please, he's on his way down
right now.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.029
We've been here
for hours already.

42:44.029 --> 42:45.697
This will only take
a few minutes.
I'm tired.

42:45.697 --> 42:48.299
I just want to go home,
have dinner and a bath

42:48.299 --> 42:49.868
and put Grace
in her own crib.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.637
You want what's best
for your baby, so do I.

42:51.637 --> 42:53.104
Then leave us alone.
Judy you need to speak
to someone.

42:53.104 --> 42:54.773
She just needs
to rest.

42:54.773 --> 42:56.041
I know you don't want
to hurt yourself or Grace.

42:56.041 --> 42:57.308
You need professional help.

42:57.308 --> 42:59.878
Do you have
children?
No.

42:59.878 --> 43:01.647
Then how do you even know
what you're talking about?

43:01.647 --> 43:03.014
I'm a doctor.
But you're
not a mother.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.349
Judy, listen to me...

43:04.349 --> 43:05.917
Please don't go.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.953
My wife has a touch
of the baby blues,

43:07.953 --> 43:08.954
and you want
to lock her up?

43:08.954 --> 43:10.388
No one's locking anyone up.

43:10.388 --> 43:12.090
I just want her
to get the help that she needs.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.725
Oh, by giving
her drugs.

43:13.725 --> 43:16.061
Maybe. Ignoring it is not
gonna make it go away.

43:16.061 --> 43:19.064
It needs to be treated the same
as any other disease.

43:19.064 --> 43:20.666
No. This could
happen again,

43:20.666 --> 43:23.068
only next time,
it could be worse.

43:23.068 --> 43:23.969
Judy!

43:23.969 --> 43:25.370
Judy, please.

43:25.370 --> 43:26.371
You could die, Judy.

43:26.371 --> 43:28.874
Your baby could die!

43:29.305 --> 43:35.163
