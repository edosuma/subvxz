15:55.025 --> 15:56.156
Good.

GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER

15:58.088 --> 15:59.559
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.362

YOUR MONEY WITH GRAYSON,

A RETURN. THAT'S A GUARANTEE.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.188

24:38.708 --> 24:40.249
TODAY.

24:40.249 --> 24:42.481
ANY PARTICULAR REASON?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.914
LITTLE BIRD MAY HAVE
WHISPERED SOMETHING.
 (woman) AND FOR YOU.

24:44.914 --> 24:46.956
THANK YOU.
 (speaks indistinctly)

24:46.956 --> 24:48.257
HERE WE GO.
 I'LL WIRE THE FUNDS
THIS AFTERNOON,

24:48.257 --> 24:50.560
AND WE CAN DEAL WITH THE WHOLE
PORTFOLIO TRANSFER NEXT WEEK.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.491
SOUNDS GOOD.

24:58.628 --> 25:01.270
(Jack) HEY, POP.
YOU DOING ALL RIGHT?

25:04.534 --> 25:07.877
THE BOTTLE WAS HALF-EMPTY
WHEN I STARTED.

25:07.877 --> 25:10.209
OKAY. WELL, I'LL BE SURE
TO MAKE NOTE OF THAT

25:10.209 --> 25:11.911
IN THE INVENTORY.

25:11.911 --> 25:12.912
(chuckles)

25:12.912 --> 25:14.544
(chuckles)

25:14.544 --> 25:16.185
A YOUNG MAN SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
GIVE UP ON HIS DREAMS

25:16.185 --> 25:20.019
BECAUSE HIS OLD MAN
CAN'T RUN A BUSINESS.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.752
I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP
ON ANYTHING, DAD.

25:22.752 --> 25:25.124
AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU.

25:26.195 --> 25:28.197
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOUR MOTHER LEFT,

25:28.197 --> 25:30.029
IT ALL WENT TO HELL,
DIDN'T IT?

25:31.160 --> 25:33.903
YOU MUST BE
SO ASHAMED OF ME.

25:33.903 --> 25:36.636
DAD, I'M NOT...

25:36.636 --> 25:38.568
ASHAMED OF YOU.

25:38.568 --> 25:40.570
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

25:40.570 --> 25:44.614
YOU'VE KEPT THIS PLACE AFLOAT
AGAINST ALL ODDS.

25:44.614 --> 25:46.976
WE'RE GONNA
MAKE IT THROUGH THIS.

25:46.976 --> 25:49.779
WE'RE GONNA COME OUT ON TOP,
LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.785
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:57.186 --> 25:59.288
TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER.

25:59.288 --> 26:02.331
YOU BET IT WILL.

26:02.331 --> 26:03.793
(cell phone rings)

26:03.793 --> 26:04.994
(ring)

26:04.994 --> 26:06.936
(beeps)
 HI.

26:06.936 --> 26:08.798
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT TONIGHT.

26:08.798 --> 26:10.569
OH, YEAH?
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

26:10.569 --> 26:12.872
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT SURPRISES?

26:12.872 --> 26:14.674
TONIGHT? PRETTY GOOD.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.345
Great,
then I won't say anymore.
 (woman speaking indistinctly)

26:16.345 --> 26:17.777
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.008
HOW SHOULD I DRESS?

26:19.008 --> 26:20.710
SURPRISE ME.

26:20.710 --> 26:22.081
(cell phone beeps)

26:22.081 --> 26:23.853
DOES SHE SUSPECT ANYTHING?

26:23.853 --> 26:25.615
NOT A THING.

26:25.615 --> 26:27.116
(indistinct conversations)

26:27.116 --> 26:28.618
(cell phone beeps)
 (woman)
IN OTHER FINANCIAL NEWS,

26:28.618 --> 26:30.319
WALL STREET IS BUZZING
WITH RUMORS

26:30.319 --> 26:32.361
THAT ALLCOM CELLULAR
IS NOW A FRONT-RUNNER

26:32.361 --> 26:34.323
FOR AN EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT

26:34.323 --> 26:37.026
WITH INNOVATIVE CHIP MAKER
NOLCORP.

26:37.026 --> 26:40.029
NOLAN ROSS,
THE NOTORIOUSLY CAGEY C.E.O...
 (cell phone rings)

26:40.029 --> 26:41.370
(beeps)
 AND FOUNDER HAS PROMISED...

26:41.370 --> 26:42.702
HELLO.
 A WEBCAM ANNOUNCEMENT...

26:42.702 --> 26:44.603
EMILY, BILL HARMON.
 TO ADDRESS THOSE RUMORS...

26:44.603 --> 26:46.335
LISTEN, THAT LITTLE BIRD
THAT WHISPERED ALLCOM...
 NOW JUST MOMENTS AWAY.

26:46.335 --> 26:48.277
IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE
THE GENTLEMAN I SAW YOU

26:48.277 --> 26:50.379
HUGGING OUTSIDE THE CAFE
THIS MORNING?
 SELF-PROCLAIMED TECH GOD

26:50.379 --> 26:52.141
NOLAN ROSS STARTED
WHAT WOULD BECOME NOLCORP...
 WELL, I'M NOT SAYING
THAT IT WAS

26:52.141 --> 26:53.883
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT
WASN'T, BUT WHAT I WILL SAY...

26:53.883 --> 26:55.845
AFTER DROPPING OUT OF M.I.T...
 IS THAT I TRUST
THAT LITTLE BIRD ENOUGH

26:55.845 --> 26:57.316
TO DOUBLE MY POSITION.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.287
(woman speaking indistinctly)

26:58.287 --> 27:00.690
THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW.

27:00.690 --> 27:02.251
WE'RE GOING ALL IN
ON ALLCOM.

27:02.251 --> 27:03.352
GET THE BIG DOGS IN IT.
 YOU'RE SURE?

27:03.352 --> 27:05.054
YEAH.
YEAH, MAKE THE TRADE.

27:05.054 --> 27:06.796
EVERYONE IN ON ALLCOM,
PEOPLE.

27:06.796 --> 27:08.097
BUY UP
EVERYTHING THEY'RE SELLING.

27:08.097 --> 27:09.628
EVERYTHING, NOW.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.330
...A FORTUNE 500 COMPANY

27:11.330 --> 27:13.102
WITH NOLAN BEING NAMED

27:13.102 --> 27:15.134
ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN
IN THE WORLD.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.306
HE'S KNOWN
FOR A BRAZEN ATTITUDE

27:17.306 --> 27:19.669
AND A TAKE-NO-PRISONERS
LEADERSHIP STYLE,

27:19.669 --> 27:22.111
AND NOLCORP AND ROSS CONTINUE

27:22.111 --> 27:25.414
TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES
OF CELLULAR TECHNOLOGY.

27:25.414 --> 27:27.677
WE TAKE YOU NOW, LIVE,
TO NOLAN ROSS

27:27.677 --> 27:28.647
AND THAT ANNOUNCEMENT,
AS PROMISED.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.279
LISTEN TO THIS, VALERIE.

27:30.279 --> 27:31.781
(Nolan) GREETINGS, EARTHLINGS.

27:31.781 --> 27:33.422
NOLAN ROSS HERE

27:33.422 --> 27:35.354
WITH WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT

27:35.354 --> 27:37.356
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF NOLCORP,

27:37.356 --> 27:39.689
BUT SOMEONE SOMEWHERE
HAS A BIG MOUTH.

27:39.689 --> 27:42.391
I CAN NOW CONFIRM
THAT THE ALLCOM RUMORS

27:42.391 --> 27:45.094
CAME FROM
A WOEFULLY MISGUIDED EMPLOYEE.

27:45.094 --> 27:46.766
ALLCOM IS DEAD TO ME

27:46.766 --> 27:48.437
AND WILL NOT BE RECEIVING
THE CONTRACT.

27:48.437 --> 27:50.099
WHAT?

27:50.099 --> 27:52.241
NO.
 INSTEAD, I'VE DECIDED TO OFFER
OUR HUMBLE SERVICES...

27:52.241 --> 27:53.402
NO.

27:53.402 --> 27:55.404
TO ALLCOM'S
SOON-TO-BE CHIEF COMPETITOR,

27:55.404 --> 27:57.406
UNITECH.

27:57.406 --> 27:58.878
WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.380
EXPECT UNITECH
TO OPEN HUGE TOMORROW,

28:01.380 --> 28:04.313
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO BET BIG ON ALLCOM CELLULAR,

28:04.313 --> 28:07.717
GET READY TO COVER
SOME EQUALLY HEAVY LOSSES.

28:07.717 --> 28:09.418
IN RELATED TECH NEWS,
THE NEXT GENERATION...

28:09.418 --> 28:10.419
(telephone beeps)

28:10.419 --> 28:12.691
EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.994
IF YOU VALUE YOUR JOBS,
KEEP YOUR MOUTHS SHUT.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.926
AS FAR AS OUR INVESTORS
ARE CONCERNED,

28:16.926 --> 28:18.697
IT'S JUST
ANOTHER SUNSHINY DAY.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.429
WORD OF THIS LEAKS,
WE'RE FINISHED.

28:20.429 --> 28:23.432
HELLO, THIS IS VALERIE CALLING
FROM BILL HARMON'S OFFICE.

28:23.432 --> 28:25.074
I'M AFRAID
I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS

28:25.074 --> 28:26.876
REGARDING
A MAJOR STOCK LOSS TODAY

28:26.876 --> 28:28.908
AND ITS IMMEDIATE EFFECT
ON YOUR PORTFOLIO.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.410
PLEASE CALL THE OFFICE
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.012

28:33.012 --> 28:36.415

28:43.452 --> 28:45.124

THE INFORMATION YOU REQUESTED

28:45.124 --> 28:46.826
ON EMILY THORNE.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.098
WELL, WHAT IS THIS,
A BIG "I TOLD YOU SO"?

28:49.098 --> 28:51.230
IT WAS GOING TO BE

28:51.230 --> 28:53.933
UNTIL I PRINTED OUT A ROSTER
OF ACTIVE BOARD MEMBERS

28:53.933 --> 28:56.966
OF THE NEW YORK LANDMARK
PRESERVATION SOCIETY.

28:56.966 --> 29:00.009
THIS IS A ROLL CALL
FROM FEBRUARY.

29:00.009 --> 29:02.842
AND THERE'S EMILY,
JUST LIKE SHE SAID.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.344
AND THERE'S MICHAEL DAVIS.

29:07.016 --> 29:08.948
LYDIA'S HUSBAND?

29:08.948 --> 29:10.249
YOU REMEMBER THE RUMOR

29:10.249 --> 29:13.853
THAT MICHAEL WAS SLEEPING
WITH A YOUNG LADY THIS SPRING?

29:13.853 --> 29:17.056
HERE'S ANOTHER ROLL CALL
FROM MARCH.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.757
NEITHER ARE PRESENT.

29:18.757 --> 29:19.989
COINCIDENCE?

29:25.034 --> 29:26.796
IT'S LEAKED.

29:26.796 --> 29:29.168
ALL OUR INVESTORS
ARE PULLING OUT.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.270
WE'RE FINISHED.

29:33.072 --> 29:37.106
HOW DO YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH
WHAT'S HAPPENING DOWNSTAIRS?

29:37.106 --> 29:38.978
