- No, mate.

32:30.802 --> 32:33.703
- No, it's... it's... it's gone.
- Oh, shit.

32:33.705 --> 32:36.673
Mate, we've got to get back to
the bloody truck and get help.

32:36.675 --> 32:39.208
No, mate, we're much closer to
them than we are to the truck.

32:39.210 --> 32:41.443
We've got to find them and
we'll take one of their cars.

32:41.445 --> 32:43.478
Mate, whoever was down there
before

32:43.480 --> 32:44.579
is not there any bloody more!

32:44.581 --> 32:46.615
Mate, we have got to try,
you know,

32:46.617 --> 32:49.553
we've got to go and fucking
find out, for Christ's sake!

33:03.433 --> 33:05.434
Oh, Jesus.

33:06.501 --> 33:08.867
Jesus Christ!

33:08.869 --> 33:10.870
Ohhhhh.

33:10.872 --> 33:12.872
Jesus Christ.

33:12.874 --> 33:14.740
Ken, look, mate, look.

33:14.742 --> 33:18.811
Oh, mate, I'm not fucking blind.
I can see, alright?

33:18.813 --> 33:21.747
What the fuck is happening here?

33:21.749 --> 33:24.586
Oh, Jesus, look at that.

33:26.820 --> 33:28.686
She's...

33:28.688 --> 33:30.688
Blue, she's...

33:30.690 --> 33:33.460
(STAMMERS) They're... they're
just kids, mate.

33:38.765 --> 33:42.498
(KEN MOANS)
Ahh... there's more of them.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.435
- How do you know?
- There's two tents, right?

33:45.437 --> 33:49.672
I mean, they're not going to
come out here and go camping

33:49.674 --> 33:53.743
and sleep in separate tents,
are they, you know?

33:53.745 --> 33:58.449
So, ah, well, judging by this,
um...

34:00.551 --> 34:04.519
..this, ah, this girl, mate,
um...

34:04.521 --> 34:08.722
..I-I reckon that they would've
been sleeping in that tent

34:08.724 --> 34:13.360
and the other kids must've
took off

34:13.362 --> 34:15.666
when that bloody big pig
attacked.

34:16.931 --> 34:19.400
Now, give me that, give me that.
Here.

34:22.904 --> 34:27.840
Oh, Christ.
We don't have any bullets, mate.

34:27.842 --> 34:29.676
- What?
- I haven't loaded the mag.

34:29.678 --> 34:32.077
Oh, shit. Why didn't you bloody
check it, you stupid bastard?

34:32.079 --> 34:33.713
- Well, because...
- No fucking bullets!

34:33.715 --> 34:37.081
How was I to know we were
going to find a fucking pig

34:37.083 --> 34:39.752
the size of a fucking rhino?

34:39.754 --> 34:41.552
Jesus Christ.

34:41.554 --> 34:45.056
Blue, you're going to have to go
back to the truck, mate.

34:45.058 --> 34:47.692
I-I got bullets in the glovebox

34:47.694 --> 34:49.960
and-and I'll stay here and see
if I can find these kids.

34:49.962 --> 34:51.697
No, no. Fuck that, mate.

34:51.699 --> 34:52.763
I'm not leaving you on your own

34:52.764 --> 34:57.067
and I'm not walking back there
by myself either.

34:57.069 --> 34:59.970
Blue, I got no bullets.

34:59.972 --> 35:04.974
We are sitting ducks if that
monster fucking comes back here.

35:04.976 --> 35:08.043
You've gotta go back
to the truck, you know.

35:08.045 --> 35:13.048
I am not leaving those kids
out in the bush by themselves.

35:13.050 --> 35:15.885
You know, they'll be scared
fucking shitless.

35:15.887 --> 35:18.553
So you've got to get going.

35:18.555 --> 35:20.055
Well, what are you waiting for?

35:20.057 --> 35:24.026
Blue, look, you can do this.
You'll be back in half the time.

35:24.028 --> 35:26.995
When was the last time
you went for a jog?

35:26.997 --> 35:30.430
Alright, I'll go back
to the bloody truck, mate.

35:30.432 --> 35:33.066
But you look around, see if
there's a bloody car here,

35:33.068 --> 35:35.001
get in the bastard
and pick me up

35:35.003 --> 35:38.405
because, mate, we're both
dead men without a bloody rifle.

35:38.407 --> 35:40.973
So it's weapons first, then we
look for the bloody kids, right?

35:40.975 --> 35:44.877
Righto, mate, I'll-I'll do my
best, I'll look around, OK,

35:44.879 --> 35:47.047
but you just get going, OK?

35:47.049 --> 35:50.116
- Take the bloody torch.
- No, you-you...

35:50.118 --> 35:52.084
No, I don't need
the fucking torch, you know.

35:52.086 --> 35:53.852
I can build the fire up.
You take it.

35:53.854 --> 35:58.691
- Go on, go on, get going.
- I'm gone, bloody piss off.

35:58.693 --> 36:00.725
- Oh, Blue. Blue!
- What?

36:00.727 --> 36:02.160
Mate, go as fast as you can

36:02.162 --> 36:04.496
but find a big
motherfucking stick

36:04.498 --> 36:07.565
and grab it just in case,
alright?

36:07.567 --> 36:09.036

Yeah, it's just up here a bit.

40:34.411 --> 40:38.913
Don't panic, it's probably just
Ryan and Hanna mucking around.

40:38.915 --> 40:41.415
That is something Ryan would do.

40:41.417 --> 40:44.051
I want to tell you about this
Yara-ma-yha-who.

40:44.053 --> 40:45.856
Come sit down here for a bit.

40:49.258 --> 40:51.858
So, the Yara-ma-yha-who, right,

40:51.860 --> 40:54.795
he's like a little red man,
alright,

40:54.797 --> 40:57.030
and he kind of looks a bit like
a demon, yeah?

40:57.032 --> 40:59.999
And he doesn't have any teeth,
which is weird for a vampire.

41:00.001 --> 41:03.403
And his skin's all glossy,
like... like silk.

41:03.405 --> 41:05.971
Anyway, he climbs up high
into the trees

41:05.973 --> 41:07.839
to stalk his victims.

41:07.841 --> 41:10.710
You know, he moves like a monkey
in the trees, ooh, ooh, ooh.

41:10.712 --> 41:12.310
But he doesn't make a sound.

41:12.312 --> 41:15.214
He watches them closely,
sizing them up.

41:15.216 --> 41:17.948
And then he stalks them
and stands right above them,

41:17.950 --> 41:20.851
right above his next meal.

41:20.853 --> 41:23.988
Then, when he's ready,

41:23.990 --> 41:25.157
he jumps,

41:25.159 --> 41:27.924
wrapping these octopus-like
tentacles around his victims,

41:27.926 --> 41:29.960
sucking all the blood
out of them.

41:29.962 --> 41:32.462
Now he can dislocate his jaw,
too, like a snake,

41:32.464 --> 41:35.199
so he can swallow his victims
whole.

41:35.201 --> 41:38.034
Then, when he's finished
his meal, he rests,

41:38.036 --> 41:40.870
lets it all settles down
in his stomach.

41:40.872 --> 41:42.905
And then when he wakes up,

41:42.907 --> 41:44.974
he immediately regurgitates
everything back up

41:44.976 --> 41:46.209
onto the floor

41:46.211 --> 41:48.912
and there in a pile
of muck and goo

41:48.914 --> 41:52.083
is a baby newborn
Yara-ma-yha-who.

42:25.813 --> 42:27.779

are stalking us!

they hook into your head

to the bathroom this morning.

50:36.296 --> 50:38.263
So, what's the plan for today,
Bernie?

50:38.265 --> 50:41.599
I've been thinking we can take
a drive out to Patto's farm,

50:41.601 --> 50:44.302
we can take a picnic lunch,
have a swim in the river,

50:44.304 --> 50:46.671
when the sun starts to go down
we can do a bit of spotting.

50:46.673 --> 50:49.507
- Yeah, let's go swimming.
- You want to go swimming?

50:49.509 --> 50:52.442
Hey, Uncle Bernie, do you reckon
we could take some guns out?

50:52.444 --> 50:53.977
- Maybe just...
- Deb.

Bart wants to know
if we can take some guns.

50:56.614 --> 51:00.716
Bernie, you know how I feel
about guns.

51:00.718 --> 51:04.385
I would think that out there
at least one for safety.

Not a bad idea, Bruce.

Just for safety, Debs?

- I can tell you right now,

all those hillbillies out there
will shoot you

51:23.707 --> 51:25.406
before you step foot
on their property.

51:25.408 --> 51:29.008

at 50 meters.

- Probably 25. I don't know.
- Is that right?

was rigged.

(BIRDS CALL)

01:02:18.572 --> 01:02:21.005
I'm going to ask Elli
to marry me.

01:02:21.007 --> 01:02:23.077
What?

01:02:24.612 --> 01:02:28.245
How long have you guys been
going out, like 7, 8 months?

01:02:28.247 --> 01:02:30.582
She's the one, Bruce.

01:02:30.584 --> 01:02:35.286
When you know it, you know it.
Life's too short for what-ifs.

01:02:35.288 --> 01:02:37.321
Did you tell Debbie?

01:02:37.323 --> 01:02:40.858
No. Not yet.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:45.028
I reckon she'll be pretty happy
though, don't you think?

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:48.234
Well, she likes you
so I should think so, yeah.

01:02:49.467 --> 01:02:50.900
I mean, my only piece of advice

01:02:50.902 --> 01:02:53.201
is make sure that's what
you guys want to do.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:54.469
It is, mate.

01:02:54.471 --> 01:02:55.438

phase and...

01:02:57.875 --> 01:02:59.408
Yeah, well, we're adults, Bruce.

01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:02.611
Well, you know, marriage is not
all fun and games.

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:05.013
You've got to be in it
for the long haul.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:07.983
I am.

01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:11.952
You know, I've been helping
to raise Elli for so long

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.555
I feel like her real father

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:17.994

that if you hurt her...

01:03:20.362 --> 01:03:22.630
..I will hurt you back.

any other way, Bruce.

You know, I don't want to get
all heavy here,

01:03:30.104 --> 01:03:32.004
I don't want to piss
in your pocket

01:03:32.006 --> 01:03:37.310
but, you know,
I don't know much about you,

01:03:37.312 --> 01:03:40.144

childhood or your parents.

to do with anything?

Well, it has everything
to do with it

01:03:43.483 --> 01:03:45.150
because I want to make sure
that Elli is happy.

Well, that's good because
marriage is permanent.

Remind me, Bruce,

01:03:58.598 --> 01:04:01.265
how many times
have you been married now?

01:04:01.267 --> 01:04:03.333
Three times.

01:04:03.335 --> 01:04:05.601
Yeah. Yeah, that's my point.

01:04:05.603 --> 01:04:08.304
I'm the poster child
for what not to do.

01:04:08.306 --> 01:04:09.274
Yeah.

01:04:13.512 --> 01:04:18.247
Look... I'm sorry
if I pissed you off.

01:04:18.249 --> 01:04:19.584
Don't worry about it.

and then we'll go back, alright?

Yeah.

You look a bit out of sorts.

01:04:40.134 --> 01:04:42.569
Ah, look, it's probably nothing,
Ernie,

01:04:42.571 --> 01:04:45.339
but Dad and Blue camped out
last night

01:04:45.341 --> 01:04:47.306
and Dad said he'd be back
first thing in the morning

01:04:47.308 --> 01:04:49.275
and I haven't heard from him
all day.

01:04:49.277 --> 01:04:51.276
I can't even get him
on the bloody phone.

01:04:51.278 --> 01:04:54.479
You tried Blue's mobile?
I got his number here somewhere.

01:04:54.481 --> 01:04:56.015
I tried them like 20, 30 times.

01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:58.617
- The usual, love?
- Yes, please.

01:04:58.619 --> 01:05:00.452
That's not like your dad.

01:05:00.454 --> 01:05:04.355
I mean, he's alright, though.
He'll be alright.

01:05:04.357 --> 01:05:08.560
There's nothing out there
except dust and roos.

01:05:08.562 --> 01:05:11.096
That's a load of shit, Ernie,
and you know it!

01:05:11.098 --> 01:05:13.431
There's something out there
that's been knocking down fences

01:05:13.433 --> 01:05:16.432
and killing the livestock
for months now.

01:05:16.434 --> 01:05:19.470
You mean that monster wild boar
you claim to have seen?

01:05:19.472 --> 01:05:21.205
Not claimed to have seen,
I saw it!

01:05:21.207 --> 01:05:24.240
- Ah, you were drunk.
- I know what I saw.

01:05:24.242 --> 01:05:25.776
What exactly did you see, Jack,

01:05:25.778 --> 01:05:27.610
'cause all I've heard is
second-hand rumours

01:05:27.612 --> 01:05:29.445
and they get more
bloody ridiculous

01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:30.480
every time they're told.

01:05:30.482 --> 01:05:34.217
Well, you remember that smash
up on the highway

01:05:34.219 --> 01:05:36.219
coming into town, right,
about 12 months ago?

01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:38.120
You remember they couldn't find
the couple?

01:05:38.122 --> 01:05:41.122
All the police found
was the wrecked car, right?

01:05:41.124 --> 01:05:42.223
Yeah.

01:05:42.225 --> 01:05:46.028
Well, I was coming back
from Bob's place in me truck

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:47.529
and I'm looking out the window

01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:50.064
and I spot something
in this paddock

01:05:50.066 --> 01:05:51.798
about 300 or 400 metres out

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.202
so I gets the spotty on it...
fuck me drunk, it's a boar!

01:05:55.204 --> 01:05:56.436
It looks like a boar

01:05:56.438 --> 01:05:59.139
and it's about the size
of a fucking kombi van!

01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:01.574
Yeah, so I follow it along
with a spotlight

01:06:01.576 --> 01:06:03.276
and I'm driving along
and I'm driving along

01:06:03.278 --> 01:06:05.145
and it starts getting closer,
right,

01:06:05.147 --> 01:06:06.478
and it's about 100 metres off.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.415
And I can see that
this bastard's

01:06:08.417 --> 01:06:10.482
got a person hanging
in its mouth.

01:06:10.484 --> 01:06:12.484
Well, it's a female,
to be precise,

01:06:12.486 --> 01:06:14.352
and she's got long hair,
you know,

01:06:14.354 --> 01:06:17.289
and she's just hanging there
like a rag doll

01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:18.490
and I shat meself

01:06:18.492 --> 01:06:21.392
and then I accidentally lost
control of the spotty handle.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:24.095
SASHA: Come on.
You're shitting me, right?

01:06:24.097 --> 01:06:28.266
Pigs don't grow that bloody big
and they don't eat people.

01:06:28.268 --> 01:06:29.400
I know what I saw.

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:30.435
I might have been drunk,

01:06:30.437 --> 01:06:32.536
yeah, I shouldn't have been
driving or something.

01:06:32.538 --> 01:06:34.705
Well, it could've been anything,
eh, eh?

01:06:34.707 --> 01:06:37.674
Maybe it was a cow eating grass,
eh?

01:06:37.676 --> 01:06:40.177
Well, whatever it was when I hit
the spotty back

01:06:40.179 --> 01:06:41.845
it was long gone.

01:06:41.847 --> 01:06:44.684
How do you know it wasn't
a hairy bloke, Jack?

01:06:46.684 --> 01:06:50.286
I saw her tits, they were
hanging out the top like that.

01:06:50.288 --> 01:06:51.820
Mate, if there was something
out there

01:06:51.822 --> 01:06:53.288
as big as what you say
it is,

01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:55.657
knocking over fences
and terrorising livestock,

01:06:55.659 --> 01:06:58.694
it'll take more than a rifle
and a slug to slow it down.

01:06:58.696 --> 01:07:01.096
Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:01.098 --> 01:07:02.363
What, you believe him?

01:07:02.365 --> 01:07:04.731
Yeah, well, I've heard
stranger stories.

01:07:04.733 --> 01:07:08.169
You believe that I saw a monster
pig with a kid in its mouth?

01:07:08.171 --> 01:07:09.637
Hey?

01:07:09.639 --> 01:07:12.774
When I said to... I spoke
to the cops

01:07:12.776 --> 01:07:14.608
they just laughed at me.

01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:16.710
Yeah.
Well, you know how it is,

01:07:16.712 --> 01:07:18.744
everyone here thinks I've got
a few roos loose

01:07:18.746 --> 01:07:20.681
in the top paddock,
if you know what I mean.

01:07:20.683 --> 01:07:23.349
Mate, your drunken antics

01:07:23.351 --> 01:07:26.618
have gained you quite
a reputation around here.

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:27.886
SASHA: Ain't that the truth?

01:07:27.888 --> 01:07:29.788
I still remember you doing
the nudie run

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:31.591
- up and down the street.
- Yeah!

01:07:31.593 --> 01:07:34.493

I would like to un-see, Jack!

as big as what you reckon

01:07:43.603 --> 01:07:46.637
I reckon a lot more people
would've seen it

01:07:46.639 --> 01:07:47.606
than crazy old Jack.

01:07:47.608 --> 01:07:51.341

thanks, mate. (LAUGHS)

even if it's not a monster pig,

something is wiping out
the livestock

01:08:00.919 --> 01:08:03.188
and smashing the fences.

01:08:05.423 --> 01:08:06.755

01:08:06.757 --> 01:08:09.659
No. Hey, you know what?

01:08:09.661 --> 01:08:11.827
Bernie's out there,
swimming with his family.

01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:13.229
I'm going to give him a go.

01:08:13.231 --> 01:08:14.495
If I had a phone,

01:08:14.497 --> 01:08:16.596
if I had a phone
with one of them cameras,

01:08:16.599 --> 01:08:19.600
I woulda taken a picture,
but I don't have a phone.

01:08:19.603 --> 01:08:21.335
I don't have a phone.

01:08:21.337 --> 01:08:23.938
Nup.

01:08:23.939 --> 01:08:25.540
- Ern, can you do me a favour?
- Sure.

01:08:25.542 --> 01:08:27.341
Can you watch the pub
for a couple of hours?

01:08:27.343 --> 01:08:29.243
You know what, I'm gonna
bloody drive out there.

01:08:29.245 --> 01:08:31.511
What if they've broken down
and they've got no reception?

01:08:31.513 --> 01:08:33.712
It's a three-hour drive
out there.

01:08:33.715 --> 01:08:35.314
You're gonna hike it
all the way out there

01:08:35.317 --> 01:08:36.716
for a couple of old pissheads?

01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:40.420
Maybe they're just sleeping off
a hangover.

01:08:40.421 --> 01:08:42.421
Then that way I'll kick
both their asses

01:08:42.423 --> 01:08:43.421
to Timbuk-fucking-tu.

01:08:43.424 --> 01:08:45.559
So can you watch the pub for me?

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.595
JACK: Yep, I'll look after
the bar for you, honey.

01:08:48.596 --> 01:08:49.863
I've got this, mate.

01:08:49.865 --> 01:08:52.731
Fuck no, I want stock
when I get back.

01:08:52.733 --> 01:08:54.666
Everything's here in the folder

01:08:54.667 --> 01:08:56.835
but Tina's gonna be in
in a couple of hours anyway.

01:08:56.837 --> 01:08:58.670
She knows where everything is.

01:08:58.671 --> 01:09:01.372
Alright, thank you so much,
darling.

01:09:01.374 --> 01:09:02.740
You want me to come with ya?

01:09:02.742 --> 01:09:05.410
No, I want you to stay here
and keep drinking, right?

01:09:05.412 --> 01:09:06.678
I've got rent due
at the end of the week

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.946

for the lot of you.

are on Ernie!
