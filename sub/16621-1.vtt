WEBVTT

00:12.393 --> 00:13.724
I'll wait here.

00:34.582 --> 00:37.142
Your attention,
please. Evening visiting hours

00:37.318 --> 00:38.808
will be ending in 10 minutes.

00:38.987 --> 00:42.787
Evening visiting hours will be
ending in 10 minutes.

01:13.555 --> 01:15.614
Hey, hold up.

01:16.991 --> 01:18.015
What are you doing?

01:18.193 --> 01:20.491
Oh, we've got
a remove-and-repair order.

01:20.662 --> 01:22.061
From who?

01:24.632 --> 01:25.997
Looks like your blood lab.

01:28.336 --> 01:29.997
What is this?

02:00.468 --> 02:02.402
- Everyone has one.
- I don't.

02:02.570 --> 02:06.063
Either you don't realize it, or you're
not being honest with me or yourself.

02:06.241 --> 02:10.405
- Why'd I say I don't if I do?
- Maybe it's personal.

02:10.578 --> 02:12.068
Something you're embarrassed
to admit.

02:12.247 --> 02:14.045
Such as?

02:14.215 --> 02:16.912
- I don't know, it's your list.
- What are you guys talking about?

02:17.085 --> 02:18.849
He won't tell me
what's on his bucket list.

02:19.020 --> 02:21.921
- Because there isn't a list.
- Everyone has a bucket list.

02:22.090 --> 02:24.115
- Do you?
- Yes.

02:24.292 --> 02:26.454
I want to get married.
I want to have kids.

02:26.628 --> 02:28.858
I want to own a horse.
I want to live in Bali.

02:29.030 --> 02:31.362
I want to read all the greatest books
on the earth

02:31.532 --> 02:33.967
on a deserted island and ride
my horse on the beach all day.

02:34.135 --> 02:36.126
- Those are just things to do.
- That's the point.

02:36.304 --> 02:38.432
It's a list of things you want to do
before you die.

02:38.606 --> 02:40.438
- Okay, that's just morbid.
- It's not morbid.

02:40.608 --> 02:42.940
It's the exact opposite of morbid.

02:43.111 --> 02:44.442
It's life-affirming. It's saying,

02:44.612 --> 02:47.206
"These are the things I wanna
accomplish while I'm still here."

02:47.382 --> 02:49.783
Exactly. There's gotta be something
you really wanna do.

02:49.951 --> 02:51.544
You mean, besides
end this conversation?

02:53.655 --> 02:55.885
Alas, poor Yorick!

02:56.057 --> 03:02.087
I knew him, Horatio: A fellow
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy:

03:02.263 --> 03:05.494
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times;

03:05.667 --> 03:09.228
And now, how
abhorred in my imagination it is!

03:11.472 --> 03:13.941
I wanna do Shakespeare in the Park
for my bucket list, so...

03:14.108 --> 03:16.475
- You're all invited. Don't worry.
- Yay.

03:17.412 --> 03:19.346
Can we put things on the list
we don't wanna do?

03:20.114 --> 03:23.015
Hey, Beale, what's, uh...?
What's going on here?

03:23.184 --> 03:25.846
Oh, uh, Hamlet. Act Five,
Scene One. Heh.

03:26.054 --> 03:28.580
- Care to be my Ophelia, my lady?
- Not now.

03:28.756 --> 03:30.417
Is it...? Okay.

03:30.591 --> 03:34.528
Uh, a shipping container set off
radiation detection equipment at LAX.

03:34.696 --> 03:37.495
- Something coming in?
- Going out. Homeland Security's on it,

03:37.665 --> 03:40.362
but they want all federal
law enforcement agencies up to speed

03:40.568 --> 03:42.195
and requested us specifically.

03:42.370 --> 03:44.805
Okay. Where's Deeks?

03:44.972 --> 03:48.101
Dead in a ditch somewhere.
Or at a Denny's.

03:48.276 --> 03:51.337
I don't know. He got up early to
go train for a triathlon or something.

03:51.512 --> 03:53.105
It's probably on his bucket list.

03:53.281 --> 03:55.306
Not unless it's
sponsored by Hooters.

03:55.483 --> 03:57.212
Relax. We'll take this.

03:57.385 --> 03:59.183
Great. Radiation's
bad for my skin anyway.

04:14.168 --> 04:17.536
- Got a death wish, homes?
- Easy, Dirty Harry Winston.

04:17.704 --> 04:20.140
Dude, I almost blew your head off.

04:20.308 --> 04:22.036
Yeah, thank you for not doing that.

04:22.210 --> 04:24.577
Do you have a concealed carry permit
for that thing?

04:24.746 --> 04:27.078
- None of your business.
- No, actually it is my business,

04:27.248 --> 04:28.716
because I'm a cop
and you know that.

04:28.883 --> 04:32.080
All right, we can just act like I didn't
just ask that question, that's fine.

04:39.861 --> 04:42.592
Wow, that's beautiful.

04:42.764 --> 04:44.698
You know how much
that would cost retail?

04:44.866 --> 04:48.063
Yeah, I know exactly what it
would cost retail. Two months' salary.

04:48.236 --> 04:51.262
Yeah, maybe, if you
were playing for the Clippers.

04:51.439 --> 04:55.069
This is a steal. You are literally
stealing this from me.

04:55.243 --> 04:57.837
- I should be calling the cops.
- Again, I'm a cop.

04:58.012 --> 04:59.946
Promise me you'll get this insured.

05:00.148 --> 05:02.378
Wait a minute. Is this...?
Is this a blood diamond?

05:02.550 --> 05:05.417
That hurts, Deeks, that hurts.

05:05.586 --> 05:08.021
This is real and pure,
like the light within.

05:08.189 --> 05:12.683
I mean, just look at how it sparkles,
forged in the ancient fires of the earth.

05:12.860 --> 05:14.624
Okay, you sound like an infomercial.

05:14.796 --> 05:16.457
- So we good here?
- Yeah, yeah, no.

05:16.664 --> 05:19.065
We're definitely good, as long as
you stay away

05:19.233 --> 05:22.430
- from those, uh, police horses, right?
- Of course, of course.

05:22.603 --> 05:24.435
- That was just, uh...
- Dangerous.

05:24.605 --> 05:26.630
Stupid. Super creepy.

05:26.808 --> 05:28.435
- Mazel tov.
- Keep your pants on.

05:28.609 --> 05:30.737
All right.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.617
NCIS. What do we got, captain?

05:38.786 --> 05:41.221
Sensors got a hot reading
when they loaded this container.

05:41.389 --> 05:44.723
- Where was it headed?
- Larnaca International.

05:44.892 --> 05:46.326
- Cyprus.
- Yeah.

05:46.494 --> 05:49.464
Supposed to be carrying
refugee relief items.

05:49.630 --> 05:51.223
Has anyone alerted
the news media?

05:51.399 --> 05:52.992
- Not yet.
- Let's keep it that way.

06:01.809 --> 06:03.743
That's some strong saline.

06:07.648 --> 06:10.515
- Any word from Callen and Sam?
- No, not yet.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.281
Yes, hello.

06:20.595 --> 06:25.726
Well, well, well, it has been
a very long time, A.J.

06:26.234 --> 06:29.534
Uh, to what do I owe this...?

06:37.545 --> 06:40.276
Right. Thank you for the heads-up.

06:40.448 --> 06:45.352
Perhaps a little bit more
lead time in the future.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.318
Thanks.

06:51.025 --> 06:56.122
We're getting a visit from the
Under Secretary of Defense Duggan.

06:57.131 --> 07:00.499
- Why?
- We'll have to ask him.

07:01.135 --> 07:05.629
- Well, when is he getting here?
- He already is.

07:11.579 --> 07:13.343
- This can't be good.
- Nope.

07:14.682 --> 07:18.550
Assistant Director Owen Granger, and
Operations Manager Henrietta Lange.

07:19.387 --> 07:21.355
Under Secretary.

07:21.989 --> 07:23.684
We were not told you were coming.

07:23.858 --> 07:26.054
To do so
would have defeated my purpose.

07:26.561 --> 07:27.653
Aha.

07:27.828 --> 07:29.990
And what is that exactly?

07:30.164 --> 07:33.361
I'm heading up a Joint Task Force with
the Office of Special Investigations

07:33.534 --> 07:36.094
and Intelligence
and Security Command.

07:36.304 --> 07:39.763
This station has been compromised.
We are here to fix that.

07:39.941 --> 07:41.670
And what measures
do you expect to employ

07:41.842 --> 07:43.537
that we haven't
implemented already?

07:43.711 --> 07:47.511
Well, to start with,
we're replacing you and your staff.

08:09.634 --> 08:11.261
- Where have you been?
- Oh. Uh...

08:11.436 --> 08:14.667
I just... I got a sliver,
so I was digging out the... Huh.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.002
- I was blowing up your phone.
- Why? What's going on?

08:17.175 --> 08:20.042
- Because we're getting fired.
- I'm not that late.

08:20.245 --> 08:22.043
The whole unit's
getting shut down. Let's go.

08:22.247 --> 08:24.545
What? Are you kidding?
Wait, are you kidding?

08:24.750 --> 08:28.277
As you are all aware, this facility
and the staff has been compromised.

08:29.121 --> 08:30.782
Most of you
had nothing to do with that,

08:30.956 --> 08:33.890
but you have all been affected by it.

08:34.893 --> 08:37.294
Unfortunately, the breach was
never adequately resolved

08:37.462 --> 08:41.558
to Washington's satisfaction,
so we have been brought in to do so.

08:41.767 --> 08:44.896
This task force has been working
for months behind the scenes,

08:45.070 --> 08:47.869
and is here now
to resolve this, once and for all.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.737
All open cases will be
brought current, assigned,

08:50.909 --> 08:53.207
and handed off
to one of the task-force members.

08:53.378 --> 08:55.710
You will begin
this process immediately.

08:55.881 --> 08:59.078
Now, don't worry, after your interviews
and your polygraphs,

08:59.284 --> 09:03.152
most of you will keep your jobs,
but it just probably won't be here.

09:03.922 --> 09:06.254
I realize this is a lot to process,
so we're going to try

09:06.425 --> 09:09.087
and make this transition
as quick and painless as possible.

09:09.861 --> 09:12.523
It's obviously going to take a few days
to complete the handover,

09:12.697 --> 09:16.361
during which time I ask for your
continued cooperation and patience.

09:16.535 --> 09:18.060
Thank you.

09:20.238 --> 09:21.831
I feel like we're being punked.

09:22.007 --> 09:24.237
How is SECNAV allowing this?

09:25.677 --> 09:27.839
I don't know why she would,
if she had a choice.

09:28.013 --> 09:29.879
Please tell me you have a plan.

09:30.048 --> 09:33.575
Actually, I do.

09:35.921 --> 09:38.322
It's called retirement.

09:42.627 --> 09:46.962
Just keep working until I can
figure out what the hell is going on.

09:51.236 --> 09:55.469
The radioactive material has
been identified as cesium-137 chloride.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.371
It's colorless in crystal form,
white when powdered,

09:58.543 --> 09:59.806
and water-soluble.

09:59.978 --> 10:03.972
Hold on a second.
Is this guy for real?

10:04.149 --> 10:07.608
Deeks, focus.
Our jobs can wait. This can't.

10:07.786 --> 10:11.086
No, I'm definitely focused
on the selenium-130 chlorine.

10:11.256 --> 10:12.451
- Deeks.
- Yeah.

10:12.624 --> 10:15.389
- Cesium-137 chloride.
- Yeah, no. I got that.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.324
I was just making sure
you were listening.

10:17.496 --> 10:20.898
It's the same material that was used
in the Goiania accident in Brazil.

10:21.066 --> 10:23.330
Thieves stole hospital equipment,
to sell it for scraps.

10:23.502 --> 10:24.992
Turned out some of it
was radioactive.

10:25.170 --> 10:27.434
That's right. It glowed blue.
They thought it was cool.

10:27.606 --> 10:30.576
Passed it around to some friends.
Several people died as a result.

10:30.742 --> 10:33.006
- Why was it in the saline?
- Perhaps it's their attempt

10:33.178 --> 10:35.272
to get it past customs.
It gets to the destination,

10:35.447 --> 10:38.178
they boil off the saline,
they're left with the radioactive powder.

10:38.383 --> 10:39.748
Oh, boom. Who's listening now?

10:39.918 --> 10:42.751
So one hospital and two medical labs
within 200 miles of here

10:42.921 --> 10:46.016
have had their blood irradiation
machines stolen in the last six weeks.

10:46.191 --> 10:48.489
And we're just finding this out
now because...?

10:48.660 --> 10:51.254
The machines themselves are worth
tens of thousands of dollars.

10:51.429 --> 10:54.330
I doubt anyone thought their
stolen machine was part of a trend.

10:54.499 --> 10:56.797
- Until now.
- How much cesium are we talking?

10:56.968 --> 11:00.302
Well, enough to make several
radiological dispersal devices.

11:00.472 --> 11:02.497
I mean, dirty bombs themselves
can be lethal,

11:02.674 --> 11:05.837
but their main purpose
is as a terror device.

11:06.011 --> 11:09.970
If detonated, they could shut down
an area for months,

11:10.148 --> 11:12.845
if not years, for adequate
decontamination and cleanup.

11:13.018 --> 11:15.851
Not to mention trying to convince
people that it's safe afterwards.

11:16.021 --> 11:19.480
Unfortunately, because of its
water-soluble nature,

11:19.658 --> 11:21.990
it could be used to contaminate
city water supplies.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.060
Oh, one more fun fact.

11:24.229 --> 11:26.220
Cyprus is not its final destination.

11:26.431 --> 11:28.866
From there, it was scheduled
to be boarded onto a ship

11:29.034 --> 11:31.503
bound for the Port of Latakia, Syria.

11:31.670 --> 11:34.298
- Wonderful.
- All right, we'll take the hospital angle.

11:34.472 --> 11:36.304
You two find out who paid
for that container,

11:36.474 --> 11:38.306
- what else was inside it.
- That one's easy.

11:38.476 --> 11:40.410
It was being shipped
by a local charity group,

11:40.579 --> 11:42.707
The Foundation for Emigrant Relief.

11:42.881 --> 11:48.183
Oh, suddenly, I have a overwhelming
urge to do some charity work.

11:51.189 --> 11:53.021
You know, I was doing
a little bit of thinking

11:53.191 --> 11:55.592
that maybe what's happening
at work, you know, it's a sign.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.388
That maybe the universe is telling us
it's ready to move on

11:58.563 --> 12:01.897
- to the next chapter of our lives.
- Which is?

12:02.067 --> 12:05.594
I don't know, but maybe
it involves a career change.

12:05.770 --> 12:07.932
Okay, I'll take the bait.
What would we do?

12:08.106 --> 12:11.041
Well, we could be
in couples' figure skating.

12:12.677 --> 12:14.277
What about Bali?
You always wanted to go.

12:14.479 --> 12:17.278
- Yeah, for a trip.
- Why not go for more?

12:17.482 --> 12:19.951
You know, go down there,
we could become personal trainers,

12:20.118 --> 12:22.746
you can teach yoga,
I could teach surfing.

12:22.921 --> 12:25.185
- Ride your horse on the beach.
- Those aren't careers.

12:25.357 --> 12:28.418
- If you bring somebody with you, it is.
- Oh, tourism. Yes, let's do that.

12:28.593 --> 12:31.927
- Have you met me?
- Okay, fair enough. Um...

12:32.097 --> 12:38.230
In all seriousness, though, how much
longer are you gonna do this?

12:38.403 --> 12:41.771
Well, in case you haven't noticed,
this isn't just what I do.

12:41.940 --> 12:45.376
This is who I am. Okay?

12:45.543 --> 12:47.136
I grew up on Marine bases.

12:47.312 --> 12:50.714
Protecting people is all I know,
and if I wasn't doing this,

12:52.083 --> 12:53.642
I don't know what I would be doing.

12:53.818 --> 12:55.616
I understand everything
you're saying.

12:55.787 --> 12:58.222
I'm just saying you would also be
an amazing mom.

13:00.225 --> 13:04.458
And you're passionate and loving
and intelligent and articulate.

13:04.629 --> 13:06.620
And how fun would it be
to be there in the morning

13:06.798 --> 13:08.288
and make frittatas for kids?

13:08.466 --> 13:10.764
To be home, and helping them
with their homework,

13:10.935 --> 13:13.097
and not out all day, being shot at.

13:13.772 --> 13:14.967
And the father?

13:15.140 --> 13:17.609
Same thing. I could build tree forts.

13:17.776 --> 13:20.108
Teach some jujitsu in the backyard.

13:22.180 --> 13:23.409
Say it. Just say it.

13:24.749 --> 13:27.411
You know I have thought
about this many times.

13:29.587 --> 13:33.080
But I don't...
I don't think I'm ready yet.

13:33.258 --> 13:35.158
I mean, if I wasn't working for NCIS,

13:35.327 --> 13:37.989
I'm pretty sure I'd be working
for any other agency.

13:38.163 --> 13:40.427
The FBI, DEA, ATF...

13:42.000 --> 13:44.128
I'm just not ready.

13:52.777 --> 13:54.677
- Hi.
- Hi. Can I help you?

13:54.846 --> 13:57.838
Yeah, I was just wondering if you
have any volunteer positions available.

13:58.016 --> 14:00.815
Are you here to fulfill
a community service requirement?

14:00.985 --> 14:04.319
Heh. No, I'm just here
to lend a helping hand.

14:04.489 --> 14:06.651
Okay, well, do you have
any special skills?

14:06.958 --> 14:10.019
Yeah, I'm a pretty good ventriloquist.

14:10.729 --> 14:13.357
Yes, yes. He's quite fantastic.

14:13.531 --> 14:16.398
No, that's a lie. He's rubbish.

14:16.601 --> 14:19.536
Rubbish, I say.

14:21.106 --> 14:22.801
Of course. Yeah.

14:22.974 --> 14:24.533
Dr. Cohen to Peds ICU.

14:24.709 --> 14:26.302
Dr. Cohen to Peds ICU.

14:26.478 --> 14:29.812
- You ever seen this guy before?
- No.

14:29.981 --> 14:32.416
He's wearing gloves.
He never looks at the camera.

14:32.617 --> 14:34.813
It's not much to work with.

14:34.986 --> 14:36.476
What else do you remember
about him?

14:36.654 --> 14:40.420
- Have an accent? Tattoos?
- Sorry.

14:40.625 --> 14:42.184
What about the truck
they were driving?

14:42.360 --> 14:45.193
- Did you hear anything, any names?
- I mean, it all happened so fast.

14:45.363 --> 14:47.195
I thought it was just
another hospital mix-up.

14:47.365 --> 14:49.732
By the time I came around,
they were long gone.

14:49.901 --> 14:51.596
We'd like to get a copy
of this footage.

14:51.770 --> 14:53.534
I wish I could give you more.

14:53.705 --> 14:57.198
- Do you have a bucket list?
- Yeah. Why?

14:58.843 --> 15:01.278
- Thanks for your time.
- Thank you.

15:01.446 --> 15:04.279
Dr. Collins,
extension 2219. Dr. Collins...

15:04.449 --> 15:07.942
See? Even the doctor
has a bucket list.

15:08.153 --> 15:10.247
Bet the guys who stole the truck
have a bucket list.

15:10.422 --> 15:13.687
Oh, sure, yeah.
Become a martyr, collect 72 virgins.

15:13.858 --> 15:17.123
Always seemed kind of excessive
to me. Wouldn't six be enough?

15:17.295 --> 15:19.764
We know these guys have a truck
and they have a pallet jack,

15:19.931 --> 15:22.229
but they also need a place
to take those machines apart.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.630
Garage, backyard.

15:24.803 --> 15:26.430
City's NEST sensors never went off.

15:26.604 --> 15:28.868
It's probably shielded
while it's still in the machine.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.735
Yeah, but they took it out
and moved it.

15:30.909 --> 15:32.468
All right, so they're careful.

15:32.677 --> 15:34.357
They used some sort of
shielded containers.

15:35.580 --> 15:37.912
It's not something
you grab at Home Depot.

15:38.082 --> 15:39.106
What do you got?

15:39.284 --> 15:41.878
Okay, so I found several companies
that sell everything

15:42.053 --> 15:44.488
from lead-lined containers
to lead blankets.

15:44.689 --> 15:47.624
Most go to legitimate businesses,
hospitals, labs, universities,

15:47.792 --> 15:50.420
but there are
the occasional individual buyers.

15:50.595 --> 15:52.962
Three in California in the last
two months, to be exact,

15:53.131 --> 15:56.726
but only one in Los Angeles.
Antigam Industries.

15:56.901 --> 16:00.428
Problem is I can't find anything
on Antigam, except for their address.

16:00.605 --> 16:03.802
Antigam. Arabic for "vengeance."

16:05.276 --> 16:08.439
Subtle. Good work, Nell.
Why don't you send us that address?

16:08.613 --> 16:11.275
Uh... Nell, any news back there?

16:11.449 --> 16:13.975
Just that Under Secretary of Defense
Duggan and his people

16:14.152 --> 16:16.143
look to be moving in permanently.

16:16.321 --> 16:19.313
- What about Hetty and Granger?
- Haven't seen Granger,

16:19.491 --> 16:22.256
but Hetty's currently
packing up her desk.

16:28.433 --> 16:31.334
Hey, can I have a word?
Quick, quick word.

16:31.503 --> 16:32.766
Quick... Excuse me.

16:32.937 --> 16:35.702
Whoa, Ms. Ch... Ms. Chen.
I love it when you ignore me.

16:35.874 --> 16:37.808
- What are you doing?
- Running some pen tests.

16:37.976 --> 16:40.104
Pen te...? Whoa,
there's no food or drink in here.

16:40.278 --> 16:43.145
If you could... No, no,
you gotta take that outside. There's a...

16:44.048 --> 16:47.143
Whoa, buddy, that is not a toy. If
you could... If you could just put that...

16:47.318 --> 16:48.979
- Put that away.
- Sir, what's your name?

16:49.153 --> 16:51.349
- What?
- This is Eric Beale.

16:51.523 --> 16:53.048
He's a technical operator.

16:53.258 --> 16:57.820
I'm actually the technical operator,
and this is my Ops Center.

16:57.996 --> 17:00.192
So you're as much to blame
for the breach as anyone.

17:00.865 --> 17:03.300
What? I'll have you know
that I am the guy...

17:03.468 --> 17:06.529
Who is needed downstairs, I think.

17:06.704 --> 17:09.002
- By who?
- By me.

17:13.578 --> 17:15.672
This is Antigam Industries.

17:15.847 --> 17:17.974
Doesn't look like much.

17:40.371 --> 17:43.432
- This place is hot.
- Can we go in?

17:43.608 --> 17:46.737
- You can.
- Thank you.

17:46.911 --> 17:50.245
I'm kidding. It's cool, as long as
we don't camp out here a few weeks.

18:03.261 --> 18:05.320
Place is a ghost town.

18:11.402 --> 18:13.769
Somebody's been busy in here.

18:26.918 --> 18:28.352
- Cover me.
- Cover?

18:54.278 --> 18:56.804
- Thanks.
- Least I could do.

19:16.999 --> 19:19.127
I don't even know where to start.

19:19.302 --> 19:21.634
- Felony theft?
- That's as good a place as any.

19:21.804 --> 19:24.501
- With aggravated assault?
- That is bad.

19:24.807 --> 19:28.300
Uh... Arson and attempted murder
of two federal agents?

19:28.478 --> 19:29.639
You did try to burn us alive.

19:29.812 --> 19:32.804
In fact, you actually set him on fire.
He does not like to be set on fire.

19:32.982 --> 19:35.747
I personally don't like it,
but he really hates it.

19:35.918 --> 19:38.785
Possession and transportation
of radioactive materials

19:38.955 --> 19:40.423
for the purposes of terrorism?

19:40.590 --> 19:43.753
- We call that the big T.
- Yeah.

19:43.926 --> 19:45.860
This is where you
get smart and cooperate.

19:51.133 --> 19:55.798
I think he's giving us
the old jihad silent treatment.

20:18.794 --> 20:20.626
Goes double for me.

20:29.171 --> 20:31.333
What'd you say to him?

20:31.507 --> 20:33.566
I told him you find him
sexually attractive.

20:35.011 --> 20:38.072
And I can't guarantee I'd be able
to protect him from the blue-eyed devil.

20:43.486 --> 20:45.079
- Duggan already kick you out?
- Heh.

20:45.288 --> 20:48.656
No, he would've, if I hadn't
gotten Captain OCD out of there.

20:48.824 --> 20:51.759
Um, they were touching everything
and they were eating in Ops.

20:51.928 --> 20:54.329
Oh, those filthy dogs.

20:54.497 --> 20:56.864
- All right, so who is this guy?
- I have no clue.

20:57.033 --> 20:59.559
He had no ID on him,
his prints aren't in the system,

20:59.735 --> 21:02.170
and facial rec's drawing a blank.

21:02.338 --> 21:05.069
Everything associated with
Antigam Industries has been bogus.

21:05.241 --> 21:07.175
Okay, so, what about his cell phone?

21:07.343 --> 21:10.313
- You think you can crack it?
- Yeah.

21:11.213 --> 21:12.578
No. Maybe.

21:12.748 --> 21:15.080
Assuming he didn't institute
any anti-hacking features,

21:15.251 --> 21:20.121
which would wipe it clean on any
unauthorized attempt or compromise.

21:20.323 --> 21:22.917
Have you tried just asking him?

21:32.635 --> 21:33.864
Open it.

21:42.745 --> 21:44.406
Clearly, that didn't work.

21:44.580 --> 21:45.945
That was my phone.

21:47.049 --> 21:49.108
Yeah, but you backed it up, right?

21:50.219 --> 21:52.278
It's a good thing it wasn't his phone.

21:52.455 --> 21:54.617
You can add
destruction of federal property.

21:59.629 --> 22:01.791
- Give me that thumb.
- Thank you.

22:01.964 --> 22:03.398
You're lucky.

22:03.566 --> 22:05.728
Last guy...

22:05.901 --> 22:08.393
He lost three fingers
before we found the right one.

22:13.909 --> 22:15.570
Nice work.

22:16.646 --> 22:19.616
- This one's gonna need some work.
- Mm-hm.

22:19.782 --> 22:22.149
I finally caught Mew and Zapdos.

22:22.318 --> 22:26.277
Well, easy come,
easy "Pokémon GO."

22:26.455 --> 22:29.117
I'm heading back to Ops.
Good luck with that.

22:29.925 --> 22:32.189
This is going to Syria.

22:32.395 --> 22:34.295
Yeah, I mean,
mostly we ask for money,

22:34.463 --> 22:37.023
just because it's the easiest
to deal with and send over there,

22:37.199 --> 22:42.035
but we also accept clothing and food,
toiletries, and toys for the kids.

22:42.204 --> 22:43.603
And medical supplies?

22:43.773 --> 22:45.832
Yeah, sure, I mean,
when we can get them.

22:46.008 --> 22:47.806
And who donates those?

22:47.977 --> 22:52.312
I don't know offhand,
but I'm sure I could figure it out.

22:52.481 --> 22:56.679
Why? What do you do when you're
not volunteering or doing ventriloquy?

22:56.852 --> 22:58.946
Well, we like to refer to it
as "ventriloquesting,”

22:59.121 --> 23:01.112
because we consider it
a lifelong quest,

23:01.290 --> 23:03.452
but mostly now I'm just
trying to convince my fiancée

23:03.626 --> 23:04.957
to move to Bali with me.

23:05.127 --> 23:06.856
Whoa, you do not
get to call me that.

23:07.029 --> 23:09.225
You only pre-proposed.
That was not official.

23:09.432 --> 23:12.527
And I was open to the idea,
following a legitimate offer.

23:12.702 --> 23:14.864
Wait, who doesn't
want to move to Bali?

23:15.037 --> 23:17.665
Someone with a great job
protecting your millennial skinny butt.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.672
To be honest,
I think she's afraid of change.

23:19.842 --> 23:22.072
I am not afraid of change.
I am not afraid of anything.

23:22.244 --> 23:24.576
I will come in there
and kick your ass.

23:24.747 --> 23:26.738
Well, if she doesn't
change her mind, let me know,

23:26.949 --> 23:29.316
- because I would love to move to Bali.
- Okay.

23:29.485 --> 23:32.147
Yeah, I'm sure there's nothing
she wouldn't volunteer for.

23:32.321 --> 23:34.983
- Meow, kitty.
- I'm sorry?

23:35.157 --> 23:36.818
What? I saw a cat.

23:36.992 --> 23:38.687
You know what,
Uncle McFlirtypants?

23:38.861 --> 23:41.728
Why don't you check your phone?
Sam and Callen have a suspect.

23:44.867 --> 23:51.273
Um... Actually,
you, uh, recognize this guy?

23:51.474 --> 23:54.205
Yeah, actually, I've seen him around
with one of our donors.

23:54.376 --> 23:57.073
One of your donors?
You remember your donor's name?

23:57.246 --> 24:00.409
He didn't say.
He wanted to remain anonymous.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.347
Probably because the Ferrari
he was driving

24:02.518 --> 24:05.351
was worth more than our
operating budget for the next 20 years.

24:05.521 --> 24:07.387
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:07.556 --> 24:08.614
That's interesting.

24:08.791 --> 24:11.055
Start with support personnel.
Once they've been vetted,

24:11.227 --> 24:12.888
deactivate their access cards
and see that

24:13.062 --> 24:16.293
- they're escorted off the premises.
- We're all over it.

24:16.499 --> 24:18.399
- You got a minute?
- Not really.

24:18.567 --> 24:19.591
Humor me.

24:19.769 --> 24:23.034
I'm afraid there's little room for humor
in this situation, assistant director.

24:23.205 --> 24:25.367
There are a million ways
this could've been handled.

24:25.541 --> 24:26.804
Having you come here personally

24:27.009 --> 24:29.535
- makes the least amount of sense.
- You know what they say.

24:29.712 --> 24:33.706
- If you want something done right...
- Just wait a second. Just hold it.

24:36.452 --> 24:38.113
What is it that you want?

24:40.089 --> 24:43.616
I want to keep this nation safe
from our enemies.

24:43.793 --> 24:45.784
Since you and your people
haven't been able to...

24:45.961 --> 24:47.793
My people do more
to keep this country safe...

24:47.963 --> 24:50.432
Your people can't even
find a mole in your own house.

24:50.599 --> 24:52.590
If you could, I wouldn't be here.

24:54.637 --> 24:58.801
If I were you, Granger,
I'd be focused on my future.

24:58.974 --> 25:00.567
You know how this works.

25:00.743 --> 25:03.075
Somebody's going to
take the fall for this.

25:03.245 --> 25:05.577
It's either going to be you or Hetty.

25:08.551 --> 25:11.680
Do you really think I'd sell her out
to save my own skin?

25:13.055 --> 25:14.682
I don't know.

25:14.857 --> 25:18.691
But if you're going to, I'd suggest
you do it sooner than later.

25:18.861 --> 25:20.420
I offered her the same deal.

25:36.846 --> 25:39.838
Hetty, is this really necessary?

25:40.015 --> 25:42.848
I mean, they can't...
They can't replace all of us.

25:43.018 --> 25:45.146
They certainly can't replace you.

25:46.589 --> 25:48.990
We're all replaceable, Nell.

25:49.158 --> 25:53.322
Well, I disagree.
And I think you know I'm right.

25:53.495 --> 25:56.954
If there's anything you've taught me,
it's to never give up.

25:57.132 --> 26:00.727
You only lose when you stop fighting.
You know who told me that?

26:01.737 --> 26:03.000
You did.

26:06.375 --> 26:09.003
I think I read it on a fortune cookie.

26:11.413 --> 26:14.007
Henrietta Lange is not a quitter.

26:16.185 --> 26:19.246
Neither was Don Quixote.

26:20.055 --> 26:23.081
Fine, if you're not
going to fight this thing,

26:23.259 --> 26:25.523
the least you can do
is tell me what to do.

26:27.763 --> 26:29.356
Okay.

26:32.034 --> 26:35.493
Keep our people in the field
as long as you can.

26:38.507 --> 26:40.498
Oh, I intend to.

26:40.676 --> 26:43.168
Get everything you can on Duggan.

26:43.345 --> 26:44.779
Yes, ma'am.

26:49.551 --> 26:52.851
So I think this guy's name
is Elias Kattan.

26:53.022 --> 26:56.356
Or at least that's the name
the phone is registered to.

26:57.226 --> 26:58.387
Look at all these calls.

26:58.961 --> 27:00.929
This guy's on the phone
more than my kid.

27:01.096 --> 27:04.191
- Who, Aiden or Kamran?
- Both.

27:04.366 --> 27:06.300
Wait, who's that?

27:06.468 --> 27:09.870
- That's our guy.
- No, not him. This guy.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.572
I think that's Ahmed Han Asakeem.

27:15.311 --> 27:18.212
- AHA.
- AH.A. That's all over these texts.

27:18.380 --> 27:22.248
I thought it was an Arabic name,
or like, "Aha!"

27:25.754 --> 27:28.314
- So smart...
- Yet so Beale.

27:28.490 --> 27:32.324
So, who is this
Ahmed Han Asakeem?

27:32.494 --> 27:34.553
The more accurate question is,
who was he?

27:34.730 --> 27:36.664
He was born Tobias Thoma.

27:36.832 --> 27:39.927
Syrian citizen came here
with his family.

27:40.102 --> 27:42.434
Joined the Navy to help him
get American citizenship.

27:42.604 --> 27:45.835
He was in Naval Intelligence until
he defected and became Asakeem.

27:46.008 --> 27:47.976
Now he's a high-value target.

27:48.143 --> 27:49.770
He's the high-value target in Syria.

27:49.945 --> 27:52.971
And he's rumored to be high up
in the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham,

27:53.148 --> 27:54.411
formally the al-Nusra Front.

27:54.583 --> 27:56.415
And he's working to unite
the Free Syrian Army

27:56.585 --> 27:58.644
with the
Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union.

27:58.821 --> 28:02.018
Now, if our boy knows Asakeem
and he's in contact with him...

28:02.224 --> 28:04.488
That means that we may be
able to locate Asakeem.

28:04.660 --> 28:06.992
- And if we can find him...
- We can catch him.

28:11.100 --> 28:12.932
- What's wrong?
- Just got a text

28:13.102 --> 28:15.503
on this guy's cell phone.

28:15.671 --> 28:18.606
They're threatening
to detonate a dirty bomb in L.A.

28:18.774 --> 28:20.367
if we don't release our suspect.

28:36.089 --> 28:40.287
Uh, it's like the Invasion of the Brooks
Brothers Body Snatchers in here.

28:41.829 --> 28:45.288
- Hey, Nell, where is everybody?
- Armory.

28:45.465 --> 28:48.696
And they took Nell as well.
Nell, do you want to talk about...?

28:50.938 --> 28:51.996
Came as soon as we heard.

28:52.172 --> 28:54.504
- Did you find anything?
- Possible high roller involved.

28:54.675 --> 28:56.837
- Trying to get a name.
- We know he drives a Ferrari.

28:57.010 --> 29:00.036
We're trying to find it, but it's difficult
without full access to Ops.

29:00.214 --> 29:01.375
Does Duggan know about this?

29:01.582 --> 29:03.812
No. Last thing we need
is someone second-guessing this.

29:03.984 --> 29:06.316
- Get Callen and Sam on the horn.
- Yep.

29:06.486 --> 29:08.352
- Where are we?
- We're working on it.

29:08.522 --> 29:11.958
They were stealing the cesium
and sending it to other bomb-makers.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.025
Doesn't mean they can't
build one on their own,

29:14.194 --> 29:15.719
or dump this stulf all around town.

29:15.896 --> 29:18.058
- Can we track the text?
- If it wasn't being spoofed,

29:18.232 --> 29:20.860
I could give you an idea of
where it was when the text was sent.

29:21.034 --> 29:24.197
- But how do we check that?
- This is where the cool kids hang out.

29:24.371 --> 29:26.305
These are
Special Agents Callen and Hanna.

29:26.473 --> 29:27.907
You know Mr. Beale.

29:28.108 --> 29:29.803
We wondered where you ran off to.

29:30.911 --> 29:32.811
- Can we help you?
- Yes.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.005
You can start by telling me
what's going on here.

29:35.616 --> 29:37.744
We're in the middle of
a very time-sensitive case.

29:37.918 --> 29:39.386
Then you best tell me quickly.

29:39.553 --> 29:41.544
What now?

29:41.722 --> 29:44.487
We need to find that Ferrari.

29:44.658 --> 29:46.023
With pleasure.

29:46.193 --> 29:47.592
We don't have time to debate this.

29:47.761 --> 29:49.354
Also don't have time
to make a mistake.

29:49.529 --> 29:51.998
Handing over a suspected terrorist
is never acceptable.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.395
We're not handing him over.
We're using him to draw out

29:54.568 --> 29:56.229
whoever he's working with,
SO we can seize

29:56.403 --> 29:59.168
any more radioactive materials
they may have in their possession.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.707
I think we should send a return text,
responding as the suspect.

30:02.876 --> 30:04.605
Say he's injured
and needs to be picked up.

30:04.778 --> 30:06.177
They will see right through that.

30:06.346 --> 30:09.179
We can use his past texts and e-mails
to mimic his voice and style.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.784
The phone they used to send the text
just came online today.

30:11.952 --> 30:14.580
It's a burner phone, which suggests
that they know he's caught.

30:14.755 --> 30:16.450
He can say he escaped.

30:16.657 --> 30:18.682
This way allows us
to control the setting.

30:18.859 --> 30:22.295
Yeah, if it works out. And if it doesn't,
we've blown our one opportunity.

30:23.096 --> 30:25.758
Well, we have one advantage.

30:25.933 --> 30:28.903
- Whoever sent that text isn't a pro.
- What makes you say that?

30:29.069 --> 30:31.436
Because if he was, he would've
walked away by now.

30:31.605 --> 30:34.939
Whatever we do, we gotta do it now.
The clock is ticking.

30:36.576 --> 30:39.773
It's Callen. Duggan's allowing us
to go ahead with the exchange.

30:39.947 --> 30:42.939
- Maybe he's smarter than he looks.
- But he's insisting his men join us.

30:43.116 --> 30:45.642
- So we get travel buddies?
- God help us.

30:45.819 --> 30:47.184
Oh, boo.

30:52.059 --> 30:55.552
- Well, you see this guy?
- So far, we've got nothing.

30:57.698 --> 30:59.962
Not the best views.

31:00.133 --> 31:01.294
Kens?

31:02.703 --> 31:04.398
Nope. Deeks?

31:06.306 --> 31:08.934
I found a, uh, badly beaten pinata.

31:09.109 --> 31:10.338
Oh, he deserved it.

31:12.145 --> 31:16.241
- Think this guy's gonna show?
- Not if he spots our suit shadows.

31:41.975 --> 31:44.876
- Get down.
- Get down. Get down.

31:47.014 --> 31:48.482
L.AP.D.

31:53.387 --> 31:55.822
L.A.P.D. Nobody...
Get back, back, back.

31:56.490 --> 31:58.322
Look out, sir. Oh, jeez.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.520
Oh, that's not... Uh-oh.

32:12.372 --> 32:13.703
Serpentine.

32:13.874 --> 32:16.036
God. Son of a... Aah!

32:18.278 --> 32:19.746
Oh, no.

32:23.183 --> 32:25.515
Serpentine, serpentine, serpent...

32:28.922 --> 32:30.321
- Deeks.
- Fraggle Rock.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.790
- Deeks, you okay?
- I'm alive.

32:34.661 --> 32:37.790
Oh. I dreamt I was riding
a magic buffalo.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.229
Okay. Eric, we still got him?

32:42.335 --> 32:43.734
No.

32:45.038 --> 32:47.006
So much for teamwork.

33:11.629 --> 33:13.028
Got it?

33:16.434 --> 33:17.492
- Granger.
- I told you,

33:17.668 --> 33:19.158
we should've controlled the setting.

33:19.337 --> 33:22.204
Give a man enough rope
and he'll hang himself.

33:22.373 --> 33:25.775
- Shame it had to end this way.
- This isn't over.

33:25.943 --> 33:28.173
It is for you people.

33:29.547 --> 33:31.106
We've got it from here.

33:32.783 --> 33:35.548
Is it just me, or is today
really starting to suck?

33:36.854 --> 33:38.948
Guys, I think I know
who we're looking for.

33:39.123 --> 33:42.115
- What, the shooter on the bike?
- No, we didn't find the guy on the bike,

33:42.293 --> 33:44.785
but we got a Ferrari leaving
a parking structure in your area

33:44.962 --> 33:46.123
right after the shooting.

33:46.297 --> 33:48.197
I's registered
to one Bassel Rizvi.

33:48.366 --> 33:50.528
His cell phone number pops up
on your dead guy's phone

33:50.701 --> 33:52.669
- numerous times.
- Send us the address.

33:52.837 --> 33:54.327
- Already did.
- Yup.

33:54.972 --> 33:55.996
Okay.

33:56.541 --> 33:58.635
Wonder Twin powers activate.

34:02.580 --> 34:06.016
- What are you looking at?
- Yeah, you want some of this?

34:29.840 --> 34:31.899
Bassel, where have you been?
We need to order food.

34:32.076 --> 34:34.408
- Where are your keys?
- Oh, I Ubered from Sunset Plaza.

34:34.579 --> 34:38.413
We were drinking mimosas.
Hey, can I get another drink?

34:38.583 --> 34:41.177
Bassel? Honey?

34:52.228 --> 34:53.628
- Why are we hiding?
- What?

34:53.831 --> 34:55.525
You're the one
who pulled me back here.

34:55.699 --> 34:57.896
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

35:01.405 --> 35:03.464
Eric, we got eyes inside the house?

35:03.641 --> 35:05.040
Eric?

35:05.209 --> 35:06.267
Can Nell hear us?

35:06.444 --> 35:08.276
I think we lost
our secret squirrels.

35:08.446 --> 35:10.039
Not very discreet for a terrorist.

35:10.214 --> 35:11.648
That's because he's a wannabe.

35:11.849 --> 35:14.318
Yeah, well, I wanna be somebody
driving a Ferrari.

35:14.485 --> 35:16.419
Put it on your bucket list.

35:40.444 --> 35:43.141
- How you doing?
- Can I help you?

35:43.314 --> 35:45.908
- Yeah, is Bassel here?
- Who's asking?

35:46.083 --> 35:48.780
- We're his accountants.
- Heh. Okay.

35:48.953 --> 35:50.921
- He's inside.
- Mind if we go in?

35:52.023 --> 35:53.957
Will one of you bring me back
another drink?

35:54.692 --> 35:56.490
- Of course.
- Ha, ha.

35:59.096 --> 36:02.031
Wait, if you're accountants,
why are you carrying guns?

36:02.199 --> 36:04.031
Very protective of his money.

36:31.929 --> 36:34.193
Drop the gun. Slowly.

36:40.371 --> 36:42.999
Just so you know, there's no way
you get out of here. It's over.

36:43.174 --> 36:45.006
Kick it over to me.

36:45.843 --> 36:47.333
Hang in there, Deeks.
We're coming.

36:47.511 --> 36:49.070
Get out of here.

36:49.246 --> 36:51.476
Guys, Bassel's with Deeks,
second floor.

36:51.649 --> 36:53.242
Your wallet and your keys.

36:53.451 --> 36:56.853
Okay, just to let you know,
you're probably not gonna get very far

36:57.021 --> 36:59.718
with my wallet, because I think
even my Starbucks card is expired.

36:59.890 --> 37:02.018
You shut up. Do it. Come on.

37:08.399 --> 37:11.391
- Three dollars?
- Yeah, I'm mostly in Bitcoins now.

37:11.569 --> 37:14.732
- I'm diversifying my portfolio.
- Take your clothes off.

37:15.706 --> 37:17.196
- Seriously?
- Take your clothes off.

37:17.374 --> 37:19.672
- Hurry up.
- Oh, my God.

37:19.844 --> 37:25.078
Just to let you know, I've got a really
hefty case of Malaysia dysplasia.

37:25.249 --> 37:27.877
It's like a cross
between shingles and leprosy.

37:28.052 --> 37:31.022
- It's very contagious.
- Quit stalling. Take your pants off.

37:31.188 --> 37:33.452
- You want me to take my pants off?
- Yeah.

37:33.624 --> 37:36.286
Maybe we should dim the lights
a bit, put on a little mood music.

37:36.494 --> 37:37.552
A little Sade?

37:37.728 --> 37:40.254
But whatever.
You wanna party, we can party.

37:42.133 --> 37:43.430
- What is that?
- What is what?

37:43.601 --> 37:44.693
- What is that?
- A mint.

37:44.869 --> 37:46.598
What's in your hand?
Open your hand.

37:51.375 --> 37:52.570
Stop!

37:54.245 --> 37:55.508
Deeks.

38:21.906 --> 38:23.340
Nice tackle.

38:24.475 --> 38:26.239
Of course, it would've been
more impressive

38:26.410 --> 38:28.276
if you were on fire
and went through a window.

38:29.914 --> 38:30.938
Missed.

38:35.319 --> 38:38.254
- Where's Deeks?
- In the bathroom.

38:38.422 --> 38:40.481
- Still?
- Likes to read.

38:40.658 --> 38:43.320
Could've read War and Peace
by now. Sure he didn't fall asleep?

38:43.494 --> 38:45.861
I have actually
seen that happen before.

38:46.063 --> 38:48.464
And now I have too.
Thanks for that image.

38:48.632 --> 38:51.294
Sorry. I'll go check on him.

38:52.803 --> 38:55.033
- He say anything?
- He was asking for his lawyer

38:55.206 --> 38:58.005
- before he even got out of the pool.
- You ask me, he and his buddy

38:58.175 --> 39:00.337
are just a couple of rich kids
playing terrorist.

39:00.511 --> 39:01.945
I blame Grand Theit Auto.

39:02.112 --> 39:05.480
They're rolling around town,
pretending to live the thug life,

39:05.649 --> 39:08.550
using their trust funds to buy their way
into the warrior lifestyle.

39:08.719 --> 39:10.346
Kind of like
putting down a couple grand

39:10.521 --> 39:12.285
to have dinner
with a presidential nominee.

39:12.456 --> 39:16.825
Only in this case, it's to rub shoulders
with Ahmed Han Asakeem.

39:16.994 --> 39:19.691
This time the fantasy jihad
got a little too real.

39:19.864 --> 39:22.231
One of them ends up dead,
the other one's

39:22.399 --> 39:24.197
gonna spend the rest of his life
in prison.

39:24.368 --> 39:27.804
Eric said no other calls were made
from his phone after he tried to call us.

39:27.972 --> 39:29.030
No calls to Syria?

39:29.206 --> 39:32.073
- If he did, wasn't from that phone.
- He's trying to impress Asakeem.

39:32.243 --> 39:35.213
Last thing he wants to do is tell him
that he may have been compromised.

39:35.379 --> 39:36.869
It's probably
why he killed his buddy.

39:37.047 --> 39:39.015
You know, if Asakeem
doesn't know what happened,

39:39.183 --> 39:42.084
his people will still be expecting
that shipment of radioactive saline.

39:42.253 --> 39:46.156
- We need to make sure it gets there.
- You want to ship it to Syria?

39:46.323 --> 39:47.347
Yeah.

39:47.524 --> 39:51.051
When Asakeem's people show up
to get it, we'll be there waiting.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.926
- Deeks, you okay? Babe?
- Huh?

39:59.136 --> 40:00.331
- You awake?
- Yeah.

40:01.839 --> 40:06.504
Oh, it's just, uh, something I ate.

40:08.445 --> 40:11.904
What's with the hand,
and the towel there?

40:12.082 --> 40:14.210
- Oh, this? Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

40:14.385 --> 40:18.720
Don't ask about this, like, ever,

40:18.889 --> 40:19.913
because it's...

40:28.565 --> 40:31.967
- You find them?
- No, their phones are offline.

40:32.169 --> 40:34.103
I know where they are.

41:04.101 --> 41:05.933
Go for Chen.

41:09.340 --> 41:11.968
What? When?

41:13.143 --> 41:14.668
Callen, Hanna, Blye, and Deeks

41:14.845 --> 41:17.246
boarded a flight
40 minutes ago at LAX.

41:17.414 --> 41:19.178
For where?

41:19.350 --> 41:21.284
Amman, Jordan.

41:44.274 --> 41:46.436
So it begins.

43:36.051 --> 43:39.783
- Where's Duggan's lapdog?
- She's still not feeling well.

43:39.955 --> 43:42.424
L.A. doesn't agree with everyone.

43:42.591 --> 43:44.457
- Good.
- Sir...

43:44.626 --> 43:46.822
Under Secretary of Defense Duggan's
already not happy

43:46.995 --> 43:49.089
that our team's going after
this high-value target.

43:49.264 --> 43:51.926
What happens when he walks in
and catches us trying to help them?

43:52.100 --> 43:54.762
What difference does it make?
He's gonna replace us all anyway.

43:54.936 --> 43:58.304
This may be our last operation
together, so we better make it count.

43:58.473 --> 44:00.407
Where are we?

44:00.575 --> 44:03.567
Well, Kensi had a run-in with an
insurgent, but everything's cool.

44:03.745 --> 44:06.680
Insurgents and cool
don't really go together.

44:06.882 --> 44:08.509
- She handled it.
- Yeah?

44:08.683 --> 44:10.742
- She kill him?
- She didn't say.

44:10.919 --> 44:13.183
That means she killed him.
Where is she now?

44:13.388 --> 44:15.322
We're not 100-percent certain.

44:16.458 --> 44:18.290
- Why not?
- Well, you know,

44:18.460 --> 44:21.657
with the, uh, time difference
and the data delay...

44:23.098 --> 44:25.590
You are the worst liar
in the world, Beale.

44:25.800 --> 44:29.327
- Aw, I take that as a compliment, sir.
- You would.

44:29.504 --> 44:31.666
- Where are they, Jones?
- We're really not sure.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.205
We know that they're on the move.

44:33.408 --> 44:34.933
Then where are they going?

44:36.511 --> 44:38.411
Don't make me ask twice.

44:40.015 --> 44:42.109
- Beit Jinn.
- What?

44:42.284 --> 44:45.379
Kensi found a cell phone on the man
that she may or may not have killed.

44:45.554 --> 44:47.852
I personally choose to believe
that she didn't kill him.

44:48.023 --> 44:49.650
Just because I like to think of Kensi...

44:49.824 --> 44:50.985
- Stop it.
- Okay.

44:51.159 --> 44:53.389
Based on the intel recovered
from that cell phone,

44:53.562 --> 44:56.725
they have reason to believe that
Ahmed Han Asakeem will be there.

44:56.932 --> 44:58.991
So what? They can't
go into Beit Jinn on their own.

44:59.167 --> 45:00.532
That'd be beyond stupid.

45:00.702 --> 45:02.500
Get them on the horn right now.

45:02.671 --> 45:04.696
They turned off their comms.

45:05.473 --> 45:07.339
Why the hell would they do that?

45:07.509 --> 45:11.810
Well, I think it's
so you couldn't stop them, sir.

45:19.020 --> 45:20.146
We got movement.

45:33.235 --> 45:35.067
Confirmation. That's him.

45:36.204 --> 45:38.070
- That's Asakeem.
- Yep.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.106
Be a whole lot easier
Just to shoot him.

45:40.275 --> 45:43.040
I'd like to get out of here alive,
if possible.

45:43.211 --> 45:46.613
Yeah, because going and grabbing him
is gonna be so much safer.

45:48.250 --> 45:49.740
Kensi, Deeks,
this starts going south,

45:49.918 --> 45:51.852
- you get the hell out of here.
- Not a chance.

45:52.020 --> 45:54.853
Well, there's a little bit
of a chance, though, right?

45:55.023 --> 45:57.253
I mean, if it goes, like, really south,
then we can go?

45:59.394 --> 46:01.260
- Moving.
- I got you.

46:01.429 --> 46:04.592
All right, stop.
What is that right there?

46:04.766 --> 46:09.863
Uh... I'm gonna guess those are goats.
Maybe sheep, but most likely goats.

46:10.639 --> 46:12.437
Yeah, yeah,
I'm gonna go with goats.

46:12.607 --> 46:16.407
Yeah, definitely goats,
with a 10 percent chance of sheep.

46:18.947 --> 46:20.574
You got anything, Jones?

46:20.749 --> 46:23.081
I'm not even sure
what I'm looking for at this point.

46:23.251 --> 46:25.219
- We're looking for our team.
- Right.

46:25.387 --> 46:27.719
- Obviously.
- Hey, maybe this is a good thing.

46:27.889 --> 46:30.756
If we can't find them,
maybe Asakeem can't either.

46:32.827 --> 46:34.556
Duggan's on the move.

46:34.729 --> 46:37.426
- Okay, wipe it.
- Yeah.

46:47.942 --> 46:49.933
What are you all still doing here?

46:50.111 --> 46:53.342
Just the usual cleanup
before we hand things over.

46:53.548 --> 46:57.610
Is it usual for four of your team
members to still be missing in Syria?

46:57.786 --> 47:01.188
NCIS agents are active in
40 different countries around the globe

47:01.356 --> 47:04.417
on any given day.
Somebody should've told you that.

47:04.592 --> 47:06.754
Save the show for the kids, Granger.

47:06.928 --> 47:10.455
- You don't impress me.
- That really hurts my feelings.

47:10.632 --> 47:12.100
I'm still waiting for your briefs.

47:12.267 --> 47:16.033
You know, I'm more of a boxers guy,
and I don't like to share.

47:16.204 --> 47:18.070
Just a personal quirk.

47:19.341 --> 47:21.776
Downstairs. Now.

47:30.085 --> 47:31.519
Keep looking.

47:56.511 --> 47:57.535
Asakeem.

48:12.327 --> 48:14.318
- Sit.
- No, thanks.

48:14.496 --> 48:18.023
They say it's worse than smoking,
but you make yourself comfortable.

48:21.569 --> 48:24.266
Do you really think
you're going to survive this?

48:24.939 --> 48:27.431
I'm still not sure what this is.

48:27.909 --> 48:30.776
This is the end, for all of you.

48:31.713 --> 48:33.681
Admittedly, there was a time
when individuals

48:33.848 --> 48:37.546
like yourself and Hetty
were untouchable.

48:38.520 --> 48:43.356
The valiant Cold War warriors
and their exploits of derring-do.

48:43.525 --> 48:48.122
Anybody who calls it the Cold War
clearly was never in it.

48:48.296 --> 48:50.390
It's a different world now.

48:50.565 --> 48:52.727
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

48:54.035 --> 48:57.630
No, Granger, unfortunately it's you

48:57.806 --> 49:00.366
who has no idea
what I'm talking about.

49:00.542 --> 49:04.308
See, you used to have the reputation
of being a number-one badass.

49:04.479 --> 49:07.471
But these days, even D.C. thinks
Little Miss Sunshine runs the show,

49:07.682 --> 49:10.617
and I've seen nothing here
to prove otherwise.

49:10.785 --> 49:14.312
If I didn't know better, I'd think
you have genuine feelings for her.

49:15.790 --> 49:18.384
What can I say? I'm a romantic.

49:20.328 --> 49:21.955
You just don't get it.

49:23.264 --> 49:27.292
Let me try and explain it
in a way that you can understand.

49:28.470 --> 49:33.738
I can do more with one drone
than I can with 50 of your agents.

49:35.310 --> 49:36.937
In fact...

49:38.246 --> 49:44.709
I can do more with this
than I can with you.

49:47.422 --> 49:49.254
Welcome to the future.

49:54.262 --> 49:56.356
You know, my gun still works
when it's wet.

50:10.979 --> 50:13.107
- Are you on drugs?
- No.

50:13.281 --> 50:15.113
- Should you be?
- No.

50:15.283 --> 50:18.947
What? No. We found them.
They got Asakeem.

50:19.120 --> 50:22.317
Good work, guys. Okay, talk soon.

50:24.125 --> 50:26.526
Hey, Callen said
it went off without a hitch.

50:26.694 --> 50:29.288
They're aboard the helicopter,
headed for the USS Carl Vinson.

50:29.464 --> 50:30.954
- We're good.
- Mission accomplished.

50:31.132 --> 50:32.691
Hey.

50:38.506 --> 50:41.134
Aah! The dogs are barking.

50:41.309 --> 50:43.004
- Oh, come on, Deeks.
- Ha, ha.

50:43.177 --> 50:44.872
That's poor helicopter etiquette.

50:45.046 --> 50:48.209
And it's against the law
of the Geneva Convention.

50:48.383 --> 50:50.010
You should know, Sam,

50:50.184 --> 50:52.710
that my feet do not smell ever.

50:52.887 --> 50:53.911
- Yeah, right.
- Ever.

50:54.088 --> 50:57.422
Actually, he's right. In fact,
they are the only part of his body

50:57.592 --> 50:59.822
- that doesn't stink.
- TMI.

50:59.994 --> 51:02.691
You don't have a lot of room
to talk there, Princess Night Toots.

51:02.864 --> 51:04.855
- Oh, no.
- Sitting there blaming it on Monty.

51:05.033 --> 51:07.263
No, no, no, you don't get
to bring that to work.

51:07.435 --> 51:09.233
Guys, don't make me
stop this chopper.

51:10.038 --> 51:12.735
You're setting a very poor example
for our guest.

51:12.907 --> 51:14.841
You're all very smug.

51:15.009 --> 51:17.444
Actually, no.
I'm sarcastic, she's goofy,

51:17.612 --> 51:19.706
he's aloof,
and he's much bigger than me,

51:19.881 --> 51:22.077
so I don't say anything
condescending about him.

51:22.250 --> 51:24.912
And you, you're
out of the terrorism business.

51:25.887 --> 51:30.347
I am a drop of water in
an unstoppable ocean of change.

51:30.892 --> 51:32.621
I don't see any water out there.

51:33.194 --> 51:35.094
All I see is a whole lot of dirt.

51:45.873 --> 51:48.137
- Aah!
- We've been hit. Hang on.

52:31.951 --> 52:36.388
G. Yo, wake up, man.

52:38.791 --> 52:41.260
I think I'm sitting on
one of my kidneys.

52:45.198 --> 52:46.256
He dead?

52:46.999 --> 52:49.161
Not that lucky.

52:49.335 --> 52:50.825
Kens.

52:51.838 --> 52:53.829
- Deeks.
- Over here.

52:55.208 --> 52:58.007
Check on them.
I'll check the flight crew.

53:07.253 --> 53:11.121
Oh, God. Sam, help me.

53:11.290 --> 53:12.951
- Kensi?
- Hey.

53:13.125 --> 53:15.184
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm just stuck.

53:15.361 --> 53:17.125
Hang in there.
We'll get you out of there.

53:17.930 --> 53:19.659
Let's find something
we can use as a lever.

53:19.832 --> 53:21.630
Okay.

53:21.801 --> 53:24.270
Okay, lever.

53:28.841 --> 53:30.002
- Deeks?
- Yeah?

53:30.176 --> 53:34.135
- You'll need to put some boots on.
- What? Oh.

53:34.313 --> 53:36.179
I must have lost them
during the crash.

53:36.349 --> 53:37.441
Hey.

53:39.185 --> 53:41.984
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

53:42.154 --> 53:44.179
I just... I'm good. I just hit my head.

53:44.357 --> 53:46.553
No, no, no. Deeks.
Sit here with Kensi.

53:46.759 --> 53:48.625
Just sit here with Kensi
for a second.

53:48.794 --> 53:50.387
Okay.

53:51.831 --> 53:52.992
I got you.

53:54.267 --> 53:55.564
You okay?

53:56.502 --> 53:57.526
Pilots?

53:59.472 --> 54:01.031
Everyone here all right?

54:01.207 --> 54:05.303
Kensi's stuck,
but she says she's okay.

54:05.478 --> 54:08.641
They must have used a
rocket launcher to take us down.

54:08.814 --> 54:11.875
How far do you think we are
from those guys who shot it?

54:12.051 --> 54:14.019
Not far enough.

54:14.186 --> 54:16.814
This terrain may
slow them down a bit, but...

54:18.324 --> 54:20.088
I guarantee you
they're already on the way.

54:20.293 --> 54:23.319
Well, we're not hanging around
for them to get here.

54:23.496 --> 54:26.056
We need to put some space
between us and this crash site.

54:26.232 --> 54:29.725
Yeah, well, I guess we better
get Kensi out of there,

54:29.902 --> 54:31.336
and find Deeks some boots.

54:39.412 --> 54:41.403
You could leave that
till morning, if you'd like.

54:44.050 --> 54:48.510
In fact, I would be more than happy
to have it all boxed up for you.

54:50.456 --> 54:52.254
Wow. Heh.

55:01.200 --> 55:04.329
Yeah, you should open a museum.

55:09.609 --> 55:11.941
It must have been quite exciting.

55:13.379 --> 55:17.612
The age of secret decoder rings
and lipstick radios.

55:18.784 --> 55:21.116
But seriously, did you ever use
any of this,

55:21.287 --> 55:23.085
or is it just for show?

55:24.790 --> 55:27.088
I'm aware how difficult
this must be for you.

55:28.928 --> 55:32.387
But I also know you want what's best
for the agency and this unit.

55:33.866 --> 55:37.393
But while you were chasing
trench coats and microdots,

55:37.570 --> 55:40.437
the real culprits waltzed right past
your umbrella gun

55:40.606 --> 55:41.903
in a series of ones and zeroes

55:42.074 --> 55:44.475
and set up base camp
in your house.

55:45.511 --> 55:47.411
You're just lucky it wasn't worse.

55:53.085 --> 55:56.419
You've served
your country well, Henrietta.

55:56.589 --> 55:58.990
You should be proud of that.

56:00.960 --> 56:02.689
But you've earned your rest.

56:39.498 --> 56:42.058
Hetty, you okay?

56:44.303 --> 56:45.896
It's not right.

56:46.072 --> 56:49.804
I know. We're sorry about all this.

56:49.975 --> 56:52.342
If there's anything we can do...

56:52.511 --> 56:55.503
Oh, well, yes. You could take this.

56:57.316 --> 56:59.216
Thank you.

57:03.456 --> 57:05.356
So are you coming or not?

57:05.958 --> 57:07.392
Where are we going?

57:07.560 --> 57:10.552
Someplace safe.
Something's wrong.

57:10.730 --> 57:13.995
I need you to get in touch
with Callen and the team.

57:14.166 --> 57:17.727
The mission went off like clockwork.
They're probably having breakfast

57:17.903 --> 57:21.362
- on the Carl Vinson as we speak.
- I doubt it very much.

57:22.174 --> 57:23.733
What makes you think
something's wrong?

57:24.677 --> 57:26.111
My gut.

57:26.278 --> 57:30.613
You don't last as long as I have
without listening to it.

57:30.783 --> 57:34.117
Hetty, I'm sure we would've heard
by now if something was wrong.

57:34.286 --> 57:36.084
Just humor me.

57:36.255 --> 57:40.249
- If I'm wrong, I'll buy you both...
- Acar?

57:42.361 --> 57:43.556
Dinner.

57:44.630 --> 57:45.961
That was gonna be
my second guess.

57:46.132 --> 57:47.861
Okay.

57:48.033 --> 57:49.694
- Come on, Kens.
- Hold on. Ready?

57:49.869 --> 57:51.769
- Yeah.
- All right.

57:51.937 --> 57:55.396
- Try now. Go. Kens?
- No, I still can't.

57:55.574 --> 57:57.633
Deeks, pull her out.
Pull her out. Pull her out.

57:57.810 --> 57:58.868
- Okay, go.
- Ready?

57:59.044 --> 58:00.705
- Okay, ready.
- Ready?

58:00.880 --> 58:03.906
- One, two... Go.
- Come on.

58:05.518 --> 58:07.452
Come on, baby.

58:07.620 --> 58:09.315
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Stop, stop, stop.

58:09.522 --> 58:12.548
- What's wrong?
- Something pinching my leg. Hold on.

58:13.826 --> 58:16.659
All right. Okay, I'm good. Let's go.

58:16.829 --> 58:18.024
- You sure?
- Yes, just do it.

58:20.132 --> 58:22.999
- Come on, just get me out of here.
- Okay.

58:23.169 --> 58:24.500
- On three.
- Yep.

58:24.670 --> 58:27.662
One, two, three.

58:28.641 --> 58:30.166
Come on, baby.

58:30.776 --> 58:33.746
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
We're hurting her. We're hurting her.

58:33.913 --> 58:35.642
I'm sorry, I m sorry I'm sorry.

58:35.815 --> 58:38.182
It's okay. Just relax.

58:39.752 --> 58:42.016
If we dig some dirt
out from underneath her,

58:42.188 --> 58:44.816
we may be able to create enough
space for her to wiggle out.

58:44.990 --> 58:47.425
All right, let's find something
that looks like a shovel.

58:47.593 --> 58:49.186
- I'm sorry.
- You're okay, baby.

58:49.361 --> 58:52.820
It's fine. We're gonna
get you out of here.

58:59.338 --> 59:02.933
Did you hear that?
How sturdy is this old boatshed?

59:08.614 --> 59:10.673
Should we be wearing
life jackets, just in case?

59:10.850 --> 59:11.976
Oh, jeez.

59:12.151 --> 59:14.279
- Not you too?
- I'll get the Dramamine.

59:14.453 --> 59:16.717
No, the helo
that was transporting our team,

59:16.889 --> 59:19.654
it sent out a distress call
40 minutes ago,

59:19.825 --> 59:21.520
and then disappeared off the radar.

59:23.128 --> 59:25.153
Oh, my God.

59:26.398 --> 59:27.729
All right, keep your eyes closed.

59:28.334 --> 59:31.201
- You okay?
- Yep. Get me out of here.

59:32.905 --> 59:35.806
- It's shifting. It's shifting. It's shifting.
- Ow, ow, ow.

59:35.975 --> 59:37.374
We gotta shore it up, Deeks.

59:37.543 --> 59:38.669
- Sonofa...
- Come on. Go.

59:38.844 --> 59:41.176
- I'm slipping. Go.
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

59:41.347 --> 59:42.678
Hold on. Push.

59:44.984 --> 59:49.080
- How's that? Good?
- I think it's okay.

59:49.255 --> 59:51.053
- Good? Kens?
- It's settled.

59:51.223 --> 59:52.850
- It's all right, Kens.
- It's settled.

59:53.025 --> 59:54.584
We're gonna figure this out,
all right?

59:54.760 --> 59:56.694
It's okay. We got it off, Kensi.

59:56.862 --> 59:59.695
Baby? Baby? Kens?

59:59.865 --> 01:00:01.924
Guys, she's cold.

01:00:04.436 --> 01:00:05.835
She's got no radial pulse.

01:00:08.374 --> 01:00:11.105
- Baby.
- She's got a carotid.

01:00:11.277 --> 01:00:14.372
- So, what does that mean?
- Means her blood pressure's dropping.

01:00:14.546 --> 01:00:16.605
Means we need to get her
out of here now.

01:00:16.782 --> 01:00:18.079
Son of a bitch.

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:45.169
How old was he?

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:50.541
- I'm sorry?
- Your dog.

01:00:51.582 --> 01:00:53.016
I don't have a dog.

01:00:54.485 --> 01:00:56.283
Is that why you look so sad?

01:00:58.355 --> 01:01:00.380
This is my happy face.

01:01:00.558 --> 01:01:03.926
Ha, ha. Somehow I doubt that.

01:01:06.931 --> 01:01:08.524
I'm Heather.

01:01:10.301 --> 01:01:12.395
Well, it's nice to meet you, Heather.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:17.233
And this is
where you tell me your name.

01:01:20.578 --> 01:01:23.513
Something tells me you're
not a social butterfly.

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:25.911
- More of a moth.
- Mm.

01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:29.718
Only come out at night,
attracted to the flame.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:31.286
Yeah, something like that.

01:01:36.961 --> 01:01:38.429
Yeah?

01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:43.263
On my way.

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:45.569
The little lady?

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.965
If you only knew.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:03.079
- Where's Beale?
- Uh, he's in the head.

01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:06.120
- Eric doesn't do well on rough water.
- We're not on the water.

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:09.590
- Mm, technically, we are.
- In a building.

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:14.455
This is a guy who got sick in the
"Small World" ride at Disneyland, so...

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:16.589
So how bad is it?

01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:18.895
Oh, I puked all over Morocco.

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:24.067
- With our team.
- We haven't heard yet, sir.

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:25.572
Have they initiated a rescue op?

01:02:25.743 --> 01:02:27.973
- Not yet.
- Why the hell not?

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:31.445
The Carrier Task Force detected
multiple anti-air threats,

01:02:31.615 --> 01:02:34.107
so a helicopter-borne
rescue operation is too risky.

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:36.446
We've been assured
they'll send a Quick Reaction Force

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:39.112
just as soon as they can secure
enemy air defense.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.155
Do they know our guys
have Asakeem?

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:42.690
Yes, they know.

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:46.454
Now, if we're able to ping their location
using Callen's sat phone,

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:49.463
we may be able to send them a drone,
provide air support.

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:53.501
We could, if Hetty or I were not
persona non grata at this point.

01:02:53.671 --> 01:02:56.106
- Have any favors left?
- Oh, I doubt it.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:58.674
- What about you?
- No.

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:01.777
Too much bad juju on this one.
I think we're both untouchable.

01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:06.348
- What about Duggan?
- You're joking, right?

01:03:06.517 --> 01:03:09.953
Duggan doesn't have to know
that he's helping us.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:12.679
But we have to be back in Ops.

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:14.654
He must have gone home by now.

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:16.657
Yeah, and our badges
are all locked out now.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:18.784
Badges?

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.795
We don't need no stinking badges.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:26.031
Sorry.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.678
You really think she hurt her neck?

01:03:34.845 --> 01:03:38.509
- Just a precaution.
- Where's the Dash-27?

01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:42.482
We have casualties.
I need a Quick Reaction Force.

01:03:42.653 --> 01:03:44.587
Sending medivac and armed escort.

01:03:44.755 --> 01:03:46.450
Copy that.

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:50.551
How bad is it?

01:03:50.728 --> 01:03:52.890
Dash-2 helo had
to go back to the ship.

01:03:53.063 --> 01:03:54.997
They took heat too.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.328
How much time you think we have?

01:03:58.502 --> 01:04:01.437
Well, it helps
we got the fire out, but...

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:03.369
They're headed in the right direction.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.907
Hopefully no locals saw us go down.

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:09.569
All right, I'll see if I can find
the fast rope lines or some chain.

01:04:09.747 --> 01:04:12.546
Maybe we can jerry-rig
some sort of block-and-tackle.

01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:17.545
Kens, I promise I'm gonna
get you home, okay?

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:20.517
I promise.

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:40.577
- Whoa! You okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:42.269
- You okay?
- Shh. Yes.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.645
Yeah.

01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:55.384
Okay.

01:05:08.038 --> 01:05:09.733
Sam.

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:17.771
- Hell, yeah.
- What movie's this?

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:22.010
- Who cares?
- Say Anything? John Cusack?

01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:24.985
- Never seen it.
- How could you never have seen that?

01:05:25.155 --> 01:05:26.247
It's a great movie.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:29.051
I mean, it's no
Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but...

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:31.795
- Nell. Nell.
- God.

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:33.088
- Sorry.
- Eric.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:36.028
Security cameras are disabled.
We can turn the power back on.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.328
- Okay, but don't do that again.
- All right.

01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:43.170
Great, now we have
another problem.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.603
- What?
- Ops is locked down.

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:46.675
- No way to get in.
- Can't you override it?

01:05:46.844 --> 01:05:49.006
No, it's a fail-safe room
designed to stay operational

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:50.669
even if the building is compromised.

01:05:50.848 --> 01:05:53.044
Unless there's a fire.

01:05:53.217 --> 01:05:56.278
You can override the emergency
evacuation protocol if you're inside.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:06:00.151
Yeah, but the minute the fire alarm
goes off, Duggan will be alerted.

01:06:00.324 --> 01:06:01.814
Not if we notify the fire department

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:04.518
that we're performing
some after-hours tests.

01:06:04.695 --> 01:06:05.890
Nice.

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:09.031
- I'll get Hetty and Granger. Stay here.
- Yeah.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.735
- Ready, Deeks?
- Yeah, let's do it.

01:06:12.903 --> 01:06:16.134
All right, try to get it as deep
and as close to her as possible.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.831
Okay.

01:06:19.243 --> 01:06:20.733
Go.

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:24.545
Little bit more. Little more.

01:06:24.715 --> 01:06:26.843
Ugh. Son of a...

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:30.881
Okay, ready? One, two, three...

01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:34.386
It's working.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.349
Okay, baby. Come on.

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:38.927
It's working. I'm pulling her out.

01:06:40.898 --> 01:06:42.730
Come on, baby. Guys, she's out.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:46.564
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:06:46.737 --> 01:06:48.831
Oh, no. Guys.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:56.278
It's an open fracture. Arterial injury.

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:58.540
There should be a med kit
onboard. Find it.

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:00.877
- Okay, okay.
- Go, go.

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:06.088
- She lost about two liters of blood.
- Can we move her?

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:08.782
If there's a spinal injury,
it could make it worse.

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:11.450
We may not have a choice.

01:07:17.701 --> 01:07:19.294
And ready.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:21.731
Lighting it.

01:07:24.308 --> 01:07:26.970
Nice. And the damper?

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:30.239
It's shut.

01:07:32.115 --> 01:07:34.277
- There we go.
- Mm-hm.

01:07:36.987 --> 01:07:38.079
Ha-ho!

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:50.924
- Anytime, Beale.
- L can't log in.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:52.341
Duggan's already locked us out.

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:54.470
Swear to God,
I'm gonna kill this guy.

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:57.573
Don't worry.
Nobody puts Beale in a corner.

01:08:02.012 --> 01:08:04.310
Nell and I created
a backdoor, just in case.

01:08:06.717 --> 01:08:07.741
Okay, we good?

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:10.480
Yeah, as long as Duggan
and his people don't show up.

01:08:10.654 --> 01:08:13.749
Then let's find our people
before they do.

01:08:30.674 --> 01:08:32.540
Think we've controlled the bleeding.

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:38.278
She's still got a carotid, but it's weak.

01:08:40.017 --> 01:08:42.042
I'll stay with her.
You guys should go.

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:44.877
- We're not leaving you.
- Come on. We both know,

01:08:45.055 --> 01:08:46.853
if we all stay here, we're gonna die.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:49.816
I'm cool with that.
I mean, I'm not cool with that

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:52.484
- but I'm obviously not gonna leave her.
- None of us are.

01:08:53.697 --> 01:08:57.031
If she doesn't have surgery within
six hours, she's gonna lose this leg.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:58.965
We're here together.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.562
- And what if we don't get help?
- Then we give them one hell of a fight.

01:09:03.774 --> 01:09:06.765
We still have Asakeem.
We can use him as a bargaining chip.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:40.573
How do you want to play this?

01:09:42.076 --> 01:09:45.944
I'll go after Asakeem. He's gotta be
headed back the way we came.

01:09:46.113 --> 01:09:47.877
It's best if we stick together.

01:09:48.049 --> 01:09:50.381
He may be our only way
out of this, okay?

01:09:50.551 --> 01:09:51.881
Kensi's better off in your hands.

01:09:52.053 --> 01:09:54.920
If I don't find him quickly,
I will come back.

01:10:00.128 --> 01:10:03.496
There's a ridge, about two klicks
northwest of here.

01:10:03.665 --> 01:10:06.157
When we get to high ground,
we'll send in our new coordinates.

01:10:06.768 --> 01:10:07.963
Don't leave without me.

01:10:12.307 --> 01:10:14.571
I'll find us a stretcher.

01:10:16.577 --> 01:10:19.774
Okay, I requested satellite images
of the area under Duggan's name.

01:10:19.947 --> 01:10:21.574
What about our drone request?

01:10:21.749 --> 01:10:24.684
I'm still waiting for it to run up
the chain of command for approval.

01:10:24.852 --> 01:10:28.049
How long are our people gonna have
to wait till they get some support?

01:10:28.656 --> 01:10:32.422
They can't say, sir. I'm sorry.

01:11:08.096 --> 01:11:10.895
We're trying
to commandeer a drone.

01:11:17.004 --> 01:11:19.632
Since when do you let anyone
come in here and do what they want?

01:11:19.807 --> 01:11:22.071
You barely listen to me.

01:11:22.243 --> 01:11:27.147
I detest the man, but he's right.

01:11:27.315 --> 01:11:30.751
I was at the helm
when we were compromised.

01:11:30.918 --> 01:11:34.081
But if you give in to Duggan,
you're saying you've been bested.

01:11:34.255 --> 01:11:36.656
- Perhaps I was.
- So what?

01:11:36.824 --> 01:11:39.225
You have four people missing.

01:11:39.394 --> 01:11:43.160
- And whose fault is that?
- Who cares whose fault it is?

01:11:43.331 --> 01:11:46.494
The only thing that matters right now
is finding our team.

01:11:47.402 --> 01:11:50.428
This is not the time
for martyrdom, Henrietta.

01:11:50.638 --> 01:11:53.699
There'll be plenty of time for that
if we can't get them out.

01:11:57.678 --> 01:12:00.909
- Hetty.
- Leave me alone, Owen.

01:12:03.684 --> 01:12:06.517
I don't have anything more
to give you.

01:12:08.756 --> 01:12:12.659
I wasn't asking for me.
I was asking for them.

01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:28.375
Getting sat photos of the crash site.

01:12:29.977 --> 01:12:31.570
Is that it?

01:12:33.681 --> 01:12:35.376
What's left of it.

01:12:37.585 --> 01:12:41.419
- I don't see anyone.
- Maybe they walked away.

01:13:32.106 --> 01:13:34.336
- That was a rifle.
- It's a 5.56-caliber.

01:13:34.509 --> 01:13:35.670
That's Callen's.

01:13:35.843 --> 01:13:37.333
Would he shoot Asakeem?

01:13:37.512 --> 01:13:38.809
Only if he had to.

01:13:39.747 --> 01:13:41.511
We need to keep moving.

01:13:45.052 --> 01:13:46.520
Got them.

01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:50.519
Looks like two people.

01:13:50.691 --> 01:13:53.388
- Can you get any closer?
- Yeah.

01:13:54.328 --> 01:13:55.989
- That's Callen and Asakeem.
- Yeah.

01:13:56.163 --> 01:13:58.723
- Where are the others?
- Great question.

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.026
There.

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:04.834
It's Kensi. She's injured.

01:14:07.642 --> 01:14:09.906
Looks like Callen is
making his way toward them.

01:14:10.077 --> 01:14:15.811
Now, if these are our people here,
who are they?

01:14:18.085 --> 01:14:19.985
- A whole lot of trouble.
- Mm.

01:14:23.324 --> 01:14:27.022
- We got drone approval.
- I'll get Granger.

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.007
Move.

01:14:50.749 --> 01:14:51.875
Go.

01:15:00.326 --> 01:15:02.090
G, up here.

01:15:05.264 --> 01:15:07.255
- Come, come, come.
- Go.

01:15:12.705 --> 01:15:14.764
- Move.
- Go, go, go.

01:15:22.982 --> 01:15:24.416
Drone footage coming online now.

01:15:24.583 --> 01:15:27.314
And I'm being told an osprey
is heading towards our guys.

01:15:27.486 --> 01:15:30.114
It'll never make it in time.
Beale, is that drone armed?

01:15:30.289 --> 01:15:32.724
Yes, sir, but we have
no authority to order a strike.

01:15:33.258 --> 01:15:35.090
But Duggan does. Call it in.

01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:39.424
Sir, if we launch an unauthorized
drone strike on Syrian soil

01:15:39.598 --> 01:15:41.726
using Under Secretary of Defense
Duggan's name...

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.164
And if we don't, our people are dead.

01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:48.663
- Beale.
- I've never killed anyone before.

01:15:48.874 --> 01:15:50.569
I'm not asking you to kill anyone.

01:15:50.743 --> 01:15:52.802
But if I request a missile strike
from the drone...

01:15:52.978 --> 01:15:55.743
What if we knock on the roof first?
Detonate ordinance overhead

01:15:55.914 --> 01:15:57.404
as a warning. It may scare them off.

01:15:57.583 --> 01:16:01.144
Hellfire missiles don't have that
capability. We'll need to put it in close.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.812
What if we target the area
between our guys and them?

01:16:03.989 --> 01:16:05.989
If nothing else, it could
buy our people some time.

01:16:07.493 --> 01:16:10.258
All right, try it, but if it doesn't work,

01:16:10.429 --> 01:16:13.091
I'm gonna send these bastards
to hell in a handbasket.

01:16:13.766 --> 01:16:15.427
Yes, sir.

01:16:21.006 --> 01:16:23.475
- What the hell was that?
- That, my friend, was a gift.

01:16:26.845 --> 01:16:29.371
Call off your men, Asakeem,
or they're all gonna get killed.

01:16:29.548 --> 01:16:31.983
None of us are afraid to die.
Are you?

01:16:32.151 --> 01:16:35.644
I mean, I'm not afraid to die,
but I definitely have an aversion to it.

01:16:36.922 --> 01:16:37.980
Get Kensi out of here.

01:16:38.157 --> 01:16:39.886
I think the next one
will be a lot closer.

01:16:40.059 --> 01:16:43.654
I'll cover you. Go, Deeks.

01:16:43.829 --> 01:16:47.424
Let's go. Up, up, up.

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:52.667
Come on, baby.

01:16:55.841 --> 01:16:58.503
This is your last chance, Asakeem.

01:17:06.652 --> 01:17:09.144
Rescue aircraft
still several minutes out.

01:17:09.321 --> 01:17:12.882
- Put it right on top of them, Beale.
- Sir...

01:17:13.058 --> 01:17:14.526
Do it.

01:17:31.677 --> 01:17:34.408
- I don't see him.
- G.

01:17:41.286 --> 01:17:42.845
Callen.

01:18:17.923 --> 01:18:19.049
Hello?

01:18:20.926 --> 01:18:22.917
You're up late, sir. Is everything o...?

01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:26.828
What airstrike?
I didn't call in an airstrike.

01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:38.469
- Gangway.
- Come on, let's go. OR's ready.

01:18:39.244 --> 01:18:41.645
- You have to wait out here.
- No, I'm not gonna leave her.

01:18:41.814 --> 01:18:43.782
- We got her.
- Deeks, they got this.

01:18:43.949 --> 01:18:47.351
- You'll only be in the way.
- Come on. Let them work.

01:18:51.156 --> 01:18:52.920
Cover our tracks
as best you can, Beale.

01:18:53.091 --> 01:18:55.082
I can't guarantee
they won't track it back.

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:58.355
We have programs that identify
individual typing patterns.

01:18:59.198 --> 01:19:00.632
I can't find Hetty anywhere.

01:19:00.799 --> 01:19:02.528
Hetty can take care of herself,
believe me.

01:19:02.701 --> 01:19:05.466
- We need to get out of here now.
- Okay. Uh...

01:19:05.637 --> 01:19:07.605
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:19:07.773 --> 01:19:09.502
Okay, good to go.

01:19:17.182 --> 01:19:20.982
Come on, let's go. Hurry.

01:19:35.167 --> 01:19:36.862
Open the damn door.

01:20:03.662 --> 01:20:06.029
Oh. Sorry.

01:20:08.066 --> 01:20:10.398
- It's Hetty.
- Where the hell is she?

01:20:10.569 --> 01:20:13.197
I don't know. It's just a
bunch of numbers and letters.

01:20:13.372 --> 01:20:17.240
- "1D4D52C4."
- Are those coordinates?

01:20:17.409 --> 01:20:21.073
I have no idea.
Is that, like, a code or file name?

01:20:21.747 --> 01:20:23.010
Sir?

01:20:24.883 --> 01:20:25.941
They're chess moves.

01:20:26.151 --> 01:20:28.119
It's one of the oldest openings
in the game.

01:20:28.287 --> 01:20:30.881
It's called the Queen's Gambit.

01:20:31.056 --> 01:20:33.957
Sacrificing a pawn
to gain advantage.

01:20:35.027 --> 01:20:36.358
Who's the pawn?

01:20:40.098 --> 01:20:42.226
Looking for someone?

01:20:47.406 --> 01:20:49.170
I should've known
you were behind this.

01:20:50.042 --> 01:20:52.136
Behind what?

01:20:52.311 --> 01:20:55.474
Don't play stupid. Go find the others.

01:20:55.681 --> 01:20:57.911
There is no one else here.

01:20:58.083 --> 01:21:00.711
I don't believe you. Go.

01:21:05.424 --> 01:21:07.552
You are so finished.

01:21:09.394 --> 01:21:10.452
You're right.

01:21:14.066 --> 01:21:15.500
Oh, it's too late for that.

01:21:16.268 --> 01:21:19.602
There's no way you're getting out
of this by tendering your resignation.

01:21:19.771 --> 01:21:22.797
No, no, this is not a resignation.

01:21:24.142 --> 01:21:26.941
This is a confession.

01:21:27.112 --> 01:21:30.980
Congratulations.
You found your mole.

01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:35.586
You're the mole?
I wish that were true.

01:21:35.754 --> 01:21:38.280
But there's no way you're
going to convince me of that.

01:21:39.257 --> 01:21:42.659
This is another one
of your Hetty head games.

01:21:44.329 --> 01:21:48.357
Everyone else who works here
keeps their jobs.

01:21:48.533 --> 01:21:50.592
- I did this alone.
- Ha, ha.

01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:54.098
You're in no position
to make demands.

01:21:54.272 --> 01:21:57.173
And then you will personally
accompany me back to Washington,

01:21:57.342 --> 01:22:02.508
where I will hand-deliver this
to the Secretary of Defense.

01:22:03.749 --> 01:22:07.049
Do you really think that's going to
make a lick of difference?

01:22:08.653 --> 01:22:12.055
It's the principle.

01:22:12.824 --> 01:22:15.816
A traitor with principle. How novel.

01:22:16.695 --> 01:22:19.187
- There's no one else here, sir.
- That's okay.

01:22:19.364 --> 01:22:22.459
We've got what we came for.
Cuff her.

01:22:22.634 --> 01:22:26.571
- Is that really necessary?
- No.

01:22:26.772 --> 01:22:27.967
But do it anyway.

01:22:42.788 --> 01:22:44.882
We repaired the damage
to her femoral artery,

01:22:45.057 --> 01:22:46.991
and Ortho put an IM rod
in the femur.

01:22:47.159 --> 01:22:49.389
She's got good bounding
pedal pulses now.

01:22:49.561 --> 01:22:50.756
She going to Landstuhl?

01:22:50.929 --> 01:22:53.864
Yes, she needs a head CT and
an MRI, which we don't have onboard.

01:22:54.032 --> 01:22:56.330
- Is she awake?
- She's still in a coma.

01:22:56.501 --> 01:22:58.230
We're incorporating
therapeutic hypothermia

01:22:58.403 --> 01:22:59.700
to preserve her brain function.

01:22:59.871 --> 01:23:01.862
She's gonna be kept cold
until after neurosurgery.

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.667
- Assuming she needs it.
- Does she?

01:23:03.842 --> 01:23:05.936
We need the CT and MRI
to say for certain.

01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:07.306
Watch your back.

01:23:09.214 --> 01:23:11.876
- Excuse us.
- I'm going with her.

01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:14.041
Transport is for patients
and medical staff only.

01:23:14.219 --> 01:23:16.017
We have a full ride
because of the fighting.

01:23:16.188 --> 01:23:18.418
- I'm her fiancé.
- I'm sorry.

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:21.025
- Hang in there, Kens.
- I gotta get to Landstuhl.

01:23:21.193 --> 01:23:23.127
Deeks, she'll be gone
before we get there.

01:23:23.328 --> 01:23:25.057
What the hell?
Why would you say that?

01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:27.722
Not "gone" gone.
Look, she'll be stateside in 24 hours.

01:23:27.899 --> 01:23:29.298
These guys don't mess around.

01:23:29.468 --> 01:23:31.232
She'll probably get home
before we do.

01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:33.267
Let's go.

01:23:41.613 --> 01:23:42.705
Move.

01:23:44.049 --> 01:23:45.949
I hope he was worth it.
