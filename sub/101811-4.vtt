WEBVTT

00:12.186 --> 00:14.666
The facts here
are not in question.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.668
Richard Farmer

00:16.712 --> 00:20.020
had dinner and drinks
at a local restaurant,

00:20.063 --> 00:22.805
and then he got behind
the wheel of his car.

00:22.848 --> 00:25.547
He then struck and killed
Veronica Brooks.

00:25.590 --> 00:30.291
Mr. Farmer's blood alcohol level
was above the legal limit.

00:30.334 --> 00:34.077
And these destructive actions
constitute

00:34.121 --> 00:35.687
vehicular manslaughter.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.689
All facts.

00:37.733 --> 00:41.606
Now, the defense
argues that Mr. Farmer

00:41.650 --> 00:43.826
has a clean record

00:43.869 --> 00:46.698
and is the father
of two young children.

00:46.742 --> 00:49.745
This attempt to evoke sympathy

00:49.788 --> 00:54.315
cannot distract you
from the cold, hard facts.

00:54.358 --> 00:58.623
Diane Brooks
lost her only child.

00:58.667 --> 01:02.845
So the people are not asking
for your sympathy.

01:03.889 --> 01:05.717
We're asking for justice.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.725
It's okay, Kerstin.
Take your time.

01:13.769 --> 01:16.554
In fact, why don't you take us
back to the beginning, okay?

01:16.598 --> 01:20.732
A couple of friends and I
went dancing at Zero Club.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.299
On Bleecker Street?Yeah.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.823
When I was ready to leave,

01:24.867 --> 01:26.956
I texted for a car.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.914
Rideshare company?

01:28.958 --> 01:30.655
I've never had a problem before.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.223
Go on.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.659
I spotted the car outside,

01:34.703 --> 01:36.835
just like the one
they said they were sending.

01:36.879 --> 01:39.055
So you got in the car?Yeah.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.579
At first, things seemed fine.

01:41.623 --> 01:44.582
Then I noticed we were in a
neighborhood I didn't recognize.

01:44.626 --> 01:48.064
Next thing I knew he was
in the back seat with me,

01:48.108 --> 01:51.067
and his face was covered
with some kind of mask.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.331
Did he put his hands
on you, Kerstin?

01:54.375 --> 01:56.246
He tried to pull off my dress.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.989
That's when I opened
the car door and ran.

02:00.032 --> 02:02.034
And you found the
two police officers

02:02.078 --> 02:03.340
who took you to the hospital?

02:03.384 --> 02:05.647
Yeah.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.258
I feel so stupid.

02:08.302 --> 02:11.740
I can't believe
I let this happen.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.046
It's not your fault.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.101
[groans]

02:25.145 --> 02:26.668
I shouldn't have eaten
that breakfast burrito.

02:26.711 --> 02:28.931
Gallon of hot sauce you used
probably didn't help.

02:28.974 --> 02:31.194
No guts, no glory.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.892
Keep it up, there'll be a hole
where your guts used to be.

02:33.936 --> 02:36.504
DISPATCHER: Units confines
of the 2-9 Precinct.Uh...

02:36.547 --> 02:37.853
we have a confirmed 10-13.

02:37.896 --> 02:40.595
Repeat, 10-13, officer shot

02:40.638 --> 02:42.074
in front of 1412 River Street.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.728
It's two blocks from here.

02:43.772 --> 02:44.990
[siren starts]

02:45.034 --> 02:46.992
[sirens wailing]

02:47.036 --> 02:49.081
[indistinct chatter]

02:49.125 --> 02:50.300
Hang in there, Gordon.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.302
Hey! What happened?

02:52.346 --> 02:53.347
Spotted a perp
robbing a woman.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.609
When we tried to
make the arrest,

02:54.652 --> 02:56.698
he got hold of my
partner's gun, shot him.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.482
All right.
On three.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.832
One, two, three.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.486
Where's the perp now?

03:02.530 --> 03:04.140
Took off that way.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.972
He's hit bad.He's gonna be okay,
Flores.

03:11.408 --> 03:13.236
Hey, we got this. Go.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.672
Go to the hospital.

03:22.898 --> 03:26.249
Hey. Worst part of the job.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.251
And then some.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.955
[indistinct chatter]

03:36.999 --> 03:38.435
GORMLEY:
Detective Mulaney,

03:38.479 --> 03:39.915
please come forward.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.440
[camera shutter clicks]

03:51.796 --> 03:56.061
For her bravery and sacrifice
in the line of duty,

03:56.105 --> 04:00.675
it is my honor to award
Detective Allison Mulaney

04:00.718 --> 04:02.894
with the Police Combat Cross.

04:34.056 --> 04:38.321
Our city is, uh, deeply grateful
for her service.

04:38.365 --> 04:41.977
We wish you Godspeed
in your retirement.

04:42.020 --> 04:46.895
And whatever you need,
the NYPD is here to help.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.810
Please.

04:53.554 --> 04:54.946
Thank you, sir.

04:56.470 --> 04:59.429
For as long as I can remember,
I wanted to be a cop.

04:59.473 --> 05:02.693
Protecting this city
means everything to me.

05:02.737 --> 05:07.176
So, there is something
I need from the NYPD.

05:07.219 --> 05:09.657
I'm a New York City
police detective

05:09.700 --> 05:11.876
and now a decorated one.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.053
I want to keep on doing my job.

05:15.097 --> 05:17.099
[light applause]

05:31.331 --> 05:34.334
â™ª

05:53.788 --> 05:55.572
Okay, guys,
uh, work the street

05:55.616 --> 05:57.182
where Gordon got hit.
Full enforcement.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.488
Anything comes close
to probable cause,

05:58.532 --> 06:00.925
make the arrest,
bring them in for debriefing.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.753
Someone knows
who did this, okay?

06:02.797 --> 06:04.886
Hey, this guy
put Gordon in the hospital.

06:04.929 --> 06:07.018
He's out there walking around
with his gun right now.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.977
Nobody goes home until we nail
this son of a bitch.

06:09.020 --> 06:09.934
All right?ALL: Yes, sir.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.153
Let's go.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.242
How's he doing?

06:13.285 --> 06:15.287
He's still in surgery.Docs don't know if
he's gonna make it.

06:15.331 --> 06:16.941
All right,
let's stay positive on that.

06:16.985 --> 06:18.116
This is on me.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.466
No, it's not, Ray.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.510
JAMIE: Way this went down,
it could have

06:20.554 --> 06:21.511
been you that got shot.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.034
Be easier to live with.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.688
Only one to blame here is
the guy who pulled the trigger.

06:24.732 --> 06:25.907
And when I find that bastard,

06:25.950 --> 06:26.995
I'm gonna put a bullet
in his head.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.172
As of now, you're off-duty.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.827
Go home. We'll get this guy.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.616
He's not thinking straight.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.705
Yeah, I'm in his shoes,

06:41.749 --> 06:42.967
I'm not
thinking straight, either.

06:44.752 --> 06:47.363
ERIN: I was actually surprised
to get your call.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.801
I wanted to thank you
for making the jury understand

06:50.845 --> 06:52.629
what that man did to our family.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.501
Well, I certainly
hope the verdict

06:54.544 --> 06:56.807
gave you some consolation.It did.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.940
But it won't bring
Veronica back.

06:58.983 --> 07:02.857
She was everything I had
in this world.

07:02.900 --> 07:07.035
And justice is the only thing
I have left to give her.

07:07.078 --> 07:08.950
Which is why I'm here.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.430
I understand
you'll be making

07:10.473 --> 07:13.215
a recommendation to the judge
for Farmer's sentence.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.347
Yes.

07:15.391 --> 07:18.133
And you want Mr. Farmer's
sentence to fit the crime.

07:18.176 --> 07:22.050
To the extent
it ever could, yes.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.922
You understand that the judge
will make the decision.

07:24.966 --> 07:28.273
But the judge relies
on the prosecutor's opinion.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.537
You've done your homework.

07:34.018 --> 07:38.675
Richard Farmer killed
my little girl, Ms. Reagan.

07:40.677 --> 07:43.071
I know you'll
do the right thing.

07:46.117 --> 07:49.469
I spoke to Kerstin's
rideshare company.And?

07:49.512 --> 07:51.079
Driver said when he
arrived at the location,

07:51.122 --> 07:52.646
she wasn't there.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.996
Which means it's possible
she got in the wrong car.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.824
The company's been
having a lot of problems

07:56.867 --> 07:59.217
with rogue individuals
intercepting orders

07:59.261 --> 08:00.958
and posing as their drivers.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.613
My Sean took one of those
to a party once.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.006
I grounded him for a week.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.008
Yeah, a lot of people
use them, Danny.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.140
Yeah, but it's like
playing Russian roulette.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.099
Every time you use one
of those cars, you never know

08:11.142 --> 08:12.579
who the hell you're gonna get
behind the wheel.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.581
Mm, to be fair, a lot
of these companies

08:14.624 --> 08:17.018
have really taken
the steps to improve safety.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.934
Safety? You know, the top
company had 6,000 reports

08:19.977 --> 08:22.545
of sexual assault
in a two-year period?[phone rings]

08:22.589 --> 08:23.938
That's scary.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.374
Big time. Reagan.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.854
Yeah.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.901
A security camera about a block
from the club picked up

08:30.945 --> 08:32.337
a black sedan pulling up
about a minute

08:32.381 --> 08:34.688
before Kerstin
was abducted. Yeah.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.037
Got it.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.647
They get a shot of the tags?Yeah.

08:37.691 --> 08:38.996
It was registered
to a Dennis Strand.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.085
You get Kerstin down here
right away for a lineup.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.000
I'm gonna go pick
this mutt up myself.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.226
FRANK:
Mind if I work in?

08:56.361 --> 08:58.668
Just kidding.

08:58.712 --> 09:01.105
I'm not sure I could keep up.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.412
Commissioner.

09:05.022 --> 09:09.244
You know, you kind of
took me by surprise

09:09.287 --> 09:11.028
at that press conference.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.682
I want to stay on the job, sir.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.598
A point you might have
made privately.

09:15.642 --> 09:16.991
All due respect,

09:17.034 --> 09:18.949
we both know
where that would have gone.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.951
Exactly nowhere.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.130
Clearly you don't have
a lot of faith in my judgment.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.305
When you work a tough case,

09:27.349 --> 09:29.133
you got to use
all the leverage you got.

09:29.177 --> 09:32.180
I don't take well
to that kind of pressure.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.051
And yet here you are, sir.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.317
No detective has ever worked
an active crime scene

09:39.361 --> 09:41.189
from a wheelchair.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.844
We had a mayor who ran this city
from a wheelchair.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.976
A mayor has a desk job,
a detective does not.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.717
We aren't frontline officers.

09:47.761 --> 09:50.154
We solve crimes that
already occurred.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.809
And I'd put my clearance rate
up against any gold shield

09:52.853 --> 09:54.028
in the department.

09:54.071 --> 09:57.074
You are a gifted investigator.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.773
But answering calls
is part of the job.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.775
And many of my colleagues
can't climb a flight of stairs

10:01.818 --> 10:03.428
without having a coronary.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.259
[sighs]

10:09.478 --> 10:11.872
All I'm asking for is a chance.

10:20.184 --> 10:23.013
Sorry to interrupt your workout.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.805
Dennis Strand.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.633
Detective Reagan.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.112
That your car?

10:35.156 --> 10:37.201
Yeah.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.681
Mind if I ask
where you were last night?

10:38.725 --> 10:40.161
Um, I was working.

10:40.204 --> 10:41.641
I deliver prescriptions.

10:41.684 --> 10:42.859
At night?

10:42.903 --> 10:46.167
People get sick at night, too.Your car--

10:46.210 --> 10:47.342
last night it was spotted

10:47.385 --> 10:48.822
on Bleecker Street
in the vicinity

10:48.865 --> 10:50.475
of a nightclub where
a young woman was picked up.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.042
Driver tried to rape her.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.609
You wouldn't happen
to know anything

10:53.653 --> 10:55.089
about that, would you?

10:55.132 --> 10:56.656
Of course not.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.701
I-I mean, I... It's
possible I drove past there

10:58.745 --> 11:00.790
last night,
but I didn't pick anybody up.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.488
Tell you what-- since
you're such a model citizen,

11:03.532 --> 11:05.186
maybe you wouldn't mind
coming down to the squad room,

11:05.229 --> 11:07.275
standing in a lineup
for me, huh?

11:08.406 --> 11:09.756
Not at all.

11:09.799 --> 11:13.194
Great. Let's go.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.717
Hey, what's going on?

11:14.761 --> 11:18.503
EDP with a knife
wandered onto the playground,

11:18.547 --> 11:20.331
started threatening
the kids.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.030
Aah! I will do it!

11:23.073 --> 11:24.422
[screaming]

11:24.466 --> 11:26.642
Sir! I need youI'm gonna do it.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.817
I'll do it.to put the knife down.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.210
[shouting continues]Is that Mr. Farmer?

11:29.253 --> 11:30.951
WOMAN: Stand back.Yeah, that's
why I called you.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.213
Lives in the neighborhood.

11:32.256 --> 11:33.170
Apparently,

11:33.214 --> 11:34.694
he was heading home when he saw

11:34.737 --> 11:35.956
what was going down.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.131
We need you
to drop the knife, sir.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.176
Look, I know you don't
want to hurt anyone.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.743
Just put down the knife
and walk away.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.310
Every one of you!
I'm gonna get you!

11:42.353 --> 11:44.225
Are the officers gonna
be able to take action?

11:44.268 --> 11:46.096
ABETEMARCO:
They can't open fire on this guy

11:46.140 --> 11:47.532
without endangering
the kids.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.492
Drop the knife! Now!

11:51.623 --> 11:53.277
[grunting][screaming]

11:53.321 --> 11:54.365
[indistinct chatter]

11:54.409 --> 11:57.194
[kids screaming]

11:57.238 --> 11:58.979
ERIN:
Mr. Farmer.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.154
You okay?

12:00.197 --> 12:01.764
[grunting]The kids okay?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.592
Yes. Yes, because of you.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.117
Oh...

12:07.161 --> 12:09.076
Apply pressure here.
Apply pressure, sir.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.774
I need a bus at this
location forthwith.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.080
That's not necessary.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.256
Relax, Mr. Farmer.
Just take it easy, okay?

12:15.299 --> 12:17.084
You did good,
Mr. Farmer.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.650
You did good.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.261
Just take it easy.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.655
[indistinct chatter]

12:25.788 --> 12:27.529
Eddie.Hey.

12:27.572 --> 12:30.358
Is it our guy?Fits the description.

12:30.401 --> 12:33.317
And he was
carrying Gordon's gun.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.627
Single gunshot wound
to the head.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.548
Flores.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.898
What are you doing here?Heard the job

12:48.942 --> 12:50.508
come over the air.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.815
Just wanted to make sure
this guy got what he had coming.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.949
Looks like he did.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.618
BAKER:
There are currently

13:13.662 --> 13:16.012
11 disabled officers
serving in the NYPD.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.406
Yeah, but on ceremonial
and administrative duty.

13:18.449 --> 13:19.886
They're cutting ribbons

13:19.929 --> 13:21.322
or speaking in schools.

13:21.365 --> 13:22.497
They're not out
on the street.

13:22.540 --> 13:23.890
Which is where Detective Mulaney

13:23.933 --> 13:25.456
requested to be.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.371
Oh, come on,
she practically demanded it

13:27.415 --> 13:29.199
in a room full of reporters.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.679
Which took guts on her part.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.856
Well, it did.I'm not saying it didn't,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.380
but you can't be a detective
from a wheelchair.

13:36.424 --> 13:38.600
You can't
chase down suspects

13:38.643 --> 13:39.993
or run up stairs.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.429
The Americans
with Disabilities Act

13:41.472 --> 13:42.865
prohibits discrimination

13:42.909 --> 13:44.693
based on disabilities.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.086
It's not going away, Sid.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.305
Employers have to make
reasonable accommodations

13:48.349 --> 13:49.829
for their disabled employees.

13:49.872 --> 13:53.006
Which we do. But allowing her
to work criminal cases

13:53.049 --> 13:54.877
stretches the definition
of "reasonable."

13:54.921 --> 13:56.226
Into a damn pretzel.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.141
The ADA is still the law.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.274
Well, you can legislate
that anyone can do anything.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.232
It doesn't make it so.GARRETT:
But if you deny

14:02.276 --> 14:04.452
her request,
she can sue the department.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.715
GORMLEY:
City cuts her a big, fat check.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.325
Probably what she was
after in the first place.Hey.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.892
Hold on.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.460
I'd do the same thing
if I was in her shoes.

14:13.504 --> 14:16.246
No.
I think she's after one thing:

14:16.290 --> 14:18.553
keeping her job.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.250
Which is honorable

14:20.294 --> 14:22.600
and utterly impossible.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.211
GARRETT:
But the press

14:24.254 --> 14:26.300
and the people
will take her side.

14:26.343 --> 14:29.172
It's a classic underdog story.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.219
Tell me about it.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.657
[sighs]

14:35.700 --> 14:38.921
I'm just saying I
admire what Farmer did.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.618
It took a lot of guts.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.403
Smart PR, too.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.013
You think Farmer played hero

14:44.057 --> 14:46.842
just to get a lighter sentence
for killing Veronica Brooks?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.235
Don't you?No.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.324
He doesn't seem
like that kind of guy at all.

14:50.367 --> 14:53.631
Yeah. Killing that girl
is a lot to carry around.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.852
I actually feel bad for him,
and I'm not sure I should.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.462
This is about, uh,

14:58.506 --> 15:00.377
his sentencing recommendation,
isn't it?

15:00.421 --> 15:03.467
I got a letter from the
parents of those kids

15:03.511 --> 15:05.252
begging me for leniency.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.428
I doubt Diane Brooks
would agree.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.473
Yeah, but the problem
is they're both right.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.519
For my money,
the two incidents are separate.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.391
Yeah, but they involve
the same individual.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.915
So the question is

15:15.958 --> 15:18.352
should a man be judged
by his best day

15:18.395 --> 15:20.658
or his worst?

15:21.703 --> 15:23.966
Somewhere along the line,

15:24.010 --> 15:27.230
every bad guy
did something good.

15:27.274 --> 15:31.278
Doesn't mean he gets a pass
on the bad stuff.

15:36.370 --> 15:39.503
Kerstin, how you doing?

15:39.547 --> 15:41.766
Kind of nervous.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.334
They can't see you, so
just take your time.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.468
If you recognize anyone,
just let us know,

15:47.511 --> 15:50.514
and let us know where
you recognized him from, okay?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.391
Okay.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.828
Anyone look familiar?KERSTIN:
His back

15:59.871 --> 16:02.962
was to me when I got in the car.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.833
And when he got in the back,

16:04.876 --> 16:06.966
his face was covered
with a mask.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.837
What about when he
was outside the car?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.882
I was checking my messages.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.623
Okay, well...

16:12.667 --> 16:16.627
just take another look, okay?

16:19.630 --> 16:21.197
I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, Detectives.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.112
I just can't be sure.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.462
It's okay. Come on.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.508
Make sure

16:27.551 --> 16:28.726
she gets home okay.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.512
[sighs]
Now what?

16:31.555 --> 16:33.035
That's our guy.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.516
No telling how many women
that son of a bitch did it to.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.388
But without a positive ID,
the D.A. will never charge him.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.043
I know. Let's get a
warrant, search his car.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.480
Maybe we'll find
a forensic link to Kerstin.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.439
Yeah, and it'll
buy me more time.

16:45.482 --> 16:46.831
For what?

16:46.875 --> 16:50.270
To have a conversation
with this scumbag.

16:51.662 --> 16:54.056
Flores threatened to put
a bullet in his head,

16:54.100 --> 16:55.884
exactly the way that
that guy got executed.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.365
Well, it's got to be
a coincidence.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.410
Flores isn't that guy.I agree

17:00.454 --> 17:02.456
with you, but he had motive
and opportunity,

17:02.499 --> 17:04.719
and he issued a verbal threat.
I had to notify IAB.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.557
I'm afraid
they're gonna jam him up.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.254
Only if he killed this guy.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.169
Ask me, he had it coming.

17:20.213 --> 17:21.953
Well, we don't work that way.Well,

17:21.997 --> 17:24.608
sometimes, like when a cop
gets shot, I wish we did.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.615
[door opens]

17:33.443 --> 17:35.402
Probably think you're
pretty smart, don't you?

17:35.445 --> 17:37.230
Smart enough to know
we wouldn't be here

17:37.273 --> 17:39.841
if I was identified
in that lineup.Mm.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.582
You don't know that.And I'm willing

17:41.625 --> 17:45.412
to bet you came up empty
when you examined my car.Yeah.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.675
We came up empty
when we cleaned your car.

17:47.718 --> 17:51.679
CSU said that you had scrubbed
the back seat

17:51.722 --> 17:54.116
and vacuumed the carpet.
[chuckles]

17:54.160 --> 17:55.900
Now, why would you do that?

17:55.944 --> 17:58.947
I've always been
kind of a clean freak.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.993
You're definitely a freak.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.563
That's okay. We run into lots
of freaks like you on the job.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.130
Worst type are

18:08.174 --> 18:10.785
sexual offenders like yourself.

18:10.828 --> 18:11.960
[knock on door]

18:17.574 --> 18:19.185
[door opens]

18:20.621 --> 18:21.839
I just got a call
from the D.A.'s office.

18:21.883 --> 18:24.494
We need to charge Strand
or cut him loose.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.757
Give me another hour with him.
Get him to admit everything.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.803
The D.A.'s office is gonna
call back in ten minutes.

18:28.846 --> 18:31.719
Okay, well, when they do,
tell them he did it

18:31.762 --> 18:33.764
and he's gonna do it again.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.603
Lieutenant, I'm Sergeant Reagan.

18:46.647 --> 18:47.952
Sergeant.I was just wondering

18:47.996 --> 18:49.606
if you're gonna be bringing me
in for an interview.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.347
That won't be necessary.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.522
I just thought
maybe I could tell you

18:52.566 --> 18:53.958
what kind of cop this guy is.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.570
We gave Flores every
opportunity to clear himself.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.398
He refused to answer
any questions.

18:58.441 --> 19:01.009
He's pretty shaken up.He's also officially suspended.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.619
When our investigation's
complete,

19:02.663 --> 19:04.273
he'll likely be
charged with murder.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.209
Any change?

19:27.253 --> 19:28.428
He's in a coma.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.081
They don't know
if he's gonna wake up.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.433
Heard you wouldn't answer
any questions for IAB.

19:33.476 --> 19:34.782
Had nothing to say.

19:34.825 --> 19:35.870
If you don't defend yourself,

19:35.913 --> 19:37.088
they're gonna
hang you out to dry.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.916
I deserve it.You ask me,

19:38.960 --> 19:40.309
it sounds like

19:40.353 --> 19:41.876
you're a guy who's looking
to get himself punished.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.007
We done here?

19:43.051 --> 19:45.009
No, we're not done here.

19:45.053 --> 19:48.099
I got a lot of cops in my house
I figure would go rogue

19:48.143 --> 19:50.101
if their partner got shot.
You're not one of them.

19:50.145 --> 19:53.235
Gordon's safety was on me
and I dropped the ball.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.846
Things happen on the street.
You can't take all that weight.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.935
He wasn't your partner.No.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.328
But I've been there.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.722
You know what happens to cops
in prison?

20:01.765 --> 20:03.506
I'll take what I have coming.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.552
Look me in the eye

20:05.595 --> 20:08.468
and tell me that you killed
that perp in cold blood.

20:08.511 --> 20:12.298
I have to get back
to my partner, sir.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.533
[sighs]

20:33.362 --> 20:36.713
I know this was short notice,
so thank you for coming up.

20:36.757 --> 20:40.021
My schedule's pretty flexible
these days.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.851
Right.

20:44.939 --> 20:47.158
[sighs]

20:51.206 --> 20:52.773
So.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.862
[sighs]

20:54.905 --> 20:57.256
I am on your side.
I hope you know that.

20:57.299 --> 21:00.171
You're on my side as much as my
circumstances allow you to be.

21:00.215 --> 21:02.565
Okay.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.872
I got a call
from Chief Ellison this morning.

21:04.915 --> 21:07.048
A spot just opened up
in his command.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.919
The Chief of Detective's
office?Yes.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.921
There's room for advancement,

21:10.965 --> 21:15.274
and your work will impact every
detective in this department.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.928
Thank you very much.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.017
But I'm gonna have to pass.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.544
May I ask why?

21:24.587 --> 21:26.415
I'm a squad detective.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.678
I conduct investigations.
It's what I do.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.027
You were a squad detective.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.595
Things change,
other doors open.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.031
Those are not the doors
I want opened.

21:34.075 --> 21:36.382
Look, this is an
excellent opportunity.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.645
And frankly, it's the
only one I've got.

21:38.688 --> 21:41.996
I didn't become a cop to ride
a desk and push papers around.

21:42.039 --> 21:45.304
Well, neither did I, but I like
to think I pull my weight.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.088
There's not a slice of my life

21:47.131 --> 21:50.700
that hasn't been turned inside
out by this except for one.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.578
I've spoken to a lawyer.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.931
That is your right.

22:05.628 --> 22:09.066
But I have a responsibility
to keep my people safe,

22:09.110 --> 22:10.590
and I will.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.200
My current partner's ready
to work with me.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.637
I would never ask him
to take that risk,

22:14.681 --> 22:16.683
and neither should you.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.162
[beep]Baker?

22:18.206 --> 22:19.381
Then I'll work alone.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.644
That's a non-starter
for any detective.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.692
[door opens]

22:27.737 --> 22:30.087
I am not the enemy here,

22:30.131 --> 22:31.959
but I have a job to do.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.406
[door closes]

22:46.539 --> 22:49.019
You know, guys like
Strand always screw up.

22:49.063 --> 22:50.847
Yeah, well, we don't
have time to wait around

22:50.891 --> 22:52.675
for him to screw up.

22:52.719 --> 22:54.634
No telling how many more
woman he's gonna hurt,

22:54.677 --> 22:55.983
so next club
he ends up at,

22:56.026 --> 22:57.332
we're gonna be there
waiting for him.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.335
Well, how? It's not like
we can tail him 24-7.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.424
We can't?

23:02.468 --> 23:03.773
What is that?

23:03.817 --> 23:05.558
Not "what."

23:05.601 --> 23:08.038
Who.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.606
You put a GPS on Strand's car?Yeah.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.260
Pal of mine at TARU
owed me a favor.

23:12.303 --> 23:15.350
Well, without a court order,
that device is illegal, Danny.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.917
Nobody's gonna
know about it, okay,

23:16.960 --> 23:18.527
'cause we're gonna
catch him red-handed.

23:18.571 --> 23:19.528
How?

23:19.572 --> 23:21.965
Next club he hits,

23:22.009 --> 23:24.490
we'll have an undercover officer
waiting for him

23:24.533 --> 23:26.230
who just happens
to need a ride home.

23:26.274 --> 23:27.449
A decoy?

23:27.493 --> 23:30.060
Yes. A female officer.

23:30.104 --> 23:33.150
One he's never actually
seen the face of.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.109
Very attractive.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.372
Do you have anyone in mind?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.418
I do.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.131
You get a bonus
for staying after?

23:58.262 --> 24:00.961
I'm hoping so.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.966
Richard Farmer?

24:06.009 --> 24:07.576
Yup.

24:07.620 --> 24:08.969
Tough call.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.319
Yeah. Lucky me.

24:11.362 --> 24:16.367
How can someone be a killer
and a hero at the same time?

24:16.411 --> 24:19.370
People can be more than
one thing. Most are.

24:19.414 --> 24:23.200
Yeah, but how
do I weigh Farmer's sin

24:23.244 --> 24:24.898
against his virtue?

24:24.941 --> 24:27.466
Sounds a little
above your pay grade.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.470
I once complained
to the archbishop

24:31.513 --> 24:34.037
that I was tired
of playing God.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.605
Well, what did he say?

24:36.649 --> 24:38.651
Imagine how God feels.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.829
He also said

24:42.872 --> 24:45.179
that God puts you
in a position,

24:45.222 --> 24:47.442
but he doesn't expect
you to be perfect.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.924
Well, that's comforting,

24:50.967 --> 24:52.969
but I still don't know
what I should do.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.972
Well...

24:56.016 --> 24:58.018
if you got to
make a decision

24:58.061 --> 25:00.281
that's gonna change
people's lives,

25:00.324 --> 25:02.022
you might want to
talk to the people

25:02.065 --> 25:04.198
whose lives
you're gonna change.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.205
Great pie, Gramps.Mm-hmm.

25:11.248 --> 25:12.685
Added in some shredded coconut.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.121
Mm.JAMIE: Apparently,

25:14.164 --> 25:16.819
not everyone was thrilled
with the new recipe, though.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.040
ERIN:
Yeah, what's going on, Sean?

25:20.083 --> 25:21.694
Mm.You haven't said
two words the whole meal.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.218
Girl problems.Dad, could you just not?

25:24.261 --> 25:25.436
Did you and
Lisa break up?

25:25.480 --> 25:26.742
No, Lisa broke up with him.

25:26.786 --> 25:27.917
[gasps]

25:27.961 --> 25:28.918
So what happened?

25:28.962 --> 25:30.006
Sean.FRANK:
Come on.

25:30.050 --> 25:31.268
Give the guy a little privacy.

25:31.312 --> 25:32.443
Thank you.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.836
ERIN:
Since when has anyone

25:33.880 --> 25:35.316
respected privacy at this table?

25:35.359 --> 25:36.796
Since never.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.275
ERIN:
Yeah.Yup.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.321
Lisa accused me of flirting
with Britney Carmichael.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.322
[chuckles]

25:41.365 --> 25:42.323
Mm-hmm.Did you?

25:42.366 --> 25:44.020
I wouldn't call it flirting.

25:44.064 --> 25:45.631
[makes buzzer sound]
Wrong answer. Mm-mmm.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.633
Okay, so Britneys
are always trouble.

25:47.676 --> 25:50.244
Well, have you tried
to work it out with this Lisa?

25:50.287 --> 25:52.289
His last name
is "Reagan," remember?

25:52.333 --> 25:54.378
What's that supposed to mean?It means that

25:54.422 --> 25:57.730
every man at this table has
a reputation for bad breakups.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.209
Oh, thank you very much.[overlapping chatter]

25:59.253 --> 26:02.256
Not every man at the table.
Just some of the men.

26:02.299 --> 26:04.301
Is there something
that I should know?

26:04.345 --> 26:06.608
Yes, you should know about
Gina from his law firm.

26:06.652 --> 26:07.870
Did he ever tell you about her?

26:07.914 --> 26:09.829
What?Who is Gina?

26:09.872 --> 26:11.265
Oh, let's not
go down that road.

26:11.308 --> 26:12.962
Yeah, I'm with Dad!

26:13.006 --> 26:14.137
[laughing]

26:14.181 --> 26:15.356
She was convinced that Jamie

26:15.399 --> 26:17.837
was going to propose.DANNY:
Uh-huh.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.316
Maybe she convinced herself.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.840
DANNY: YeahReally?

26:20.883 --> 26:22.363
Could you please pass
the whipped cream?

26:22.406 --> 26:24.626
Oh, laugh it up, Romeo.

26:24.670 --> 26:27.107
Have you heard
from Nancy Drake lately?

26:27.150 --> 26:28.848
No, no, no.[overlapping chatter]

26:28.891 --> 26:30.676
Hey, you opened that door.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.286
[overlapping chatter]

26:32.329 --> 26:33.417
It's a different scenario.

26:33.461 --> 26:35.289
ERIN:
Before your mom
and dad met,

26:35.332 --> 26:38.292
he was hot and heavy
with Nancy from Chicago.Yeah...

26:38.335 --> 26:39.641
[whooping]

26:39.685 --> 26:40.947
ERIN:
Oh!

26:40.990 --> 26:43.340
Flight attendant, as I recall.DANNY:
Yes.

26:43.384 --> 26:44.385
Who wanted me
to move to Chicago,

26:44.428 --> 26:45.865
which was never gonna happen,

26:45.908 --> 26:47.170
so...Yeah, but you never
broke up with her.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.303
You just jumped
on the next flight to New York.

26:49.346 --> 26:50.739
Oh.JAMIE:
Yeah, without a word

26:50.783 --> 26:52.523
on her birthday.Yeah.

26:52.567 --> 26:54.917
[gasps] Did she
hunt you down and kill you?

26:54.961 --> 26:56.179
She was a nice girl.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.225
I didn't want to
ruin her big day.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.748
Oh. Uh-uh.ERIN:
SO you just took

26:59.792 --> 27:02.664
the coward way out
and let her hurt forever.

27:02.708 --> 27:05.972
Well, sometimes it's better
just to rip off the Band-Aid.DANNY: Yes, exactly.

27:06.015 --> 27:09.584
I think Mom told me about some
woman that you dumped for her.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.239
It was, um... Deborah something.

27:12.282 --> 27:13.370
Deborah?

27:13.414 --> 27:15.024
Now there was a bombshell.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.286
Pop.

27:16.330 --> 27:17.766
Oy. Well, now,

27:17.810 --> 27:19.507
I never heard
about this bombshell.

27:19.550 --> 27:21.857
No comment.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.772
No. No, no, no.

27:23.816 --> 27:26.688
[overlapping chatter]

27:26.732 --> 27:28.081
Tell us!

27:28.124 --> 27:29.169
[overlapping chatter]

27:29.212 --> 27:31.214
Hey, my lips are sealed.

27:31.258 --> 27:32.476
Oh, my God.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.699
â™ª [indistinct chatter]

27:38.918 --> 27:41.268
Got a text from Strand
to meet him at the corner.

27:41.311 --> 27:42.443
DANNY:
You ready to go?

27:42.486 --> 27:44.619
Yeah, except this damn wig.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.403
It's itching the hell out of me.

27:46.447 --> 27:48.275
No pain, no gain.

27:48.318 --> 27:50.320
Okay, Strand's pulling up.

27:50.364 --> 27:51.974
Got him.

27:52.018 --> 27:55.412
Once you're in the car, signal
me the second he makes his move.

27:55.456 --> 27:57.371
Copy that.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.601
Who the hell are you?

28:10.645 --> 28:11.994
I'm Leo.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.823
Police. Turn off the engine,
get out of the car.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.565
Now. Come on.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.872
Get your hands on
the hood. Let's go.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.526
Hands on the hood.
Let's move it.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.920
Why are you driving
Dennis Strand's car?

28:24.964 --> 28:27.749
He lets me use it sometimes
to... pick up some fares.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.969
Off orders you intercept
for ride share companies?

28:30.012 --> 28:32.536
Well... yeah.
Lots of people do it.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.060
Where's Strand?

28:34.103 --> 28:36.627
He's using
his other car tonight.

28:36.671 --> 28:40.022
Danny, we've got a problem.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.903
Uh, Dennis, I just
got pulled over by the cops.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.818
They were looking for you, man.

28:52.861 --> 28:53.993
STRAND:
What'd you tell 'em, Leo?

28:54.036 --> 28:54.994
[mouthing]

28:55.037 --> 28:57.039
I-I didn't tell 'em anything.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.824
Uh, are you
in some kind of trouble?

28:58.867 --> 29:00.608
Of course not.
Everything's fine.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.218
Look, man,
tell me where you are.

29:02.262 --> 29:03.350
I'll come get you.

29:03.393 --> 29:04.873
Why would I want you
to do that?

29:08.616 --> 29:10.923
How are you tonight,
Detective Reagan?

29:10.966 --> 29:13.012
Son of a bitch.

29:13.055 --> 29:14.709
Where's the girl?

29:14.753 --> 29:16.363
[muffled screaming]I'm afraid
she can't talk right now.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.757
Come on, Dennis.
A young woman was reported

29:18.800 --> 29:20.236
missing after walking outside

29:20.280 --> 29:21.847
of a club and
getting in a car

29:21.890 --> 29:23.283
in Washington Heights
an hour ago.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.763
Fits your M.O.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.939
to a tee.
Put her on the phone.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.984
Listen to me.
If she comes out of this okay,

29:29.028 --> 29:31.030
you could still come out of this
okay. Now put her on the phone.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.509
It has been

29:32.553 --> 29:34.860
lovely talking to you,
Detective.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.644
Thanks for the call.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.429
You get a location?

29:39.473 --> 29:40.996
His phone is pinging
in the vicinity

29:41.040 --> 29:43.564
of Greenwich and West 11th.

29:43.607 --> 29:46.045
Good. I want every uni in the
area looking for that vehicle.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.698
Copy that.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.048
W-What about me?

29:49.091 --> 29:51.137
You stay put. We need
a statement from you.

29:51.180 --> 29:52.312
Can I at least
get my phone back?

29:52.355 --> 29:54.618
No.

29:57.143 --> 29:59.232
After reading
all these reports,

29:59.275 --> 30:03.323
I'm starting to think that
Flores really did kill this guy.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.107
Yeah, it doesn't look good.

30:05.151 --> 30:07.762
He was drinking at a bar
seven minutes away

30:07.806 --> 30:09.242
from where the guy was killed.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.418
And he made sure to use
Gordon's gun when he did it.

30:11.461 --> 30:14.508
Like he was sending a message,
which also points to Flores.

30:15.552 --> 30:17.946
Maybe we're looking
at the wrong end of this thing.

30:17.990 --> 30:21.123
Hmm?

30:22.211 --> 30:23.909
The morning
Gordon was shot?

30:23.952 --> 30:25.127
Yeah.

30:25.171 --> 30:27.216
Several witnesses
saw the incident.

30:27.260 --> 30:30.002
And?But...

30:30.045 --> 30:32.569
all of them have one thing
in common in their statements.

30:32.613 --> 30:35.137
There's no mention of Flores.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.836
Wait, how is that possible?

30:37.879 --> 30:39.750
Only one way I can think of.

30:39.794 --> 30:41.056
Well...

30:41.100 --> 30:43.363
If Flores wasn't...

30:43.406 --> 30:46.192
there when his partner was shot.

30:51.675 --> 30:53.547
[woman crying]STRAND:
Look, I know

30:53.590 --> 30:56.463
this is awkward, but
maybe you can relaxNo.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.334
and get to know
each other?[crying]: No.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.989
You're so beautiful.No.

31:01.033 --> 31:03.426
I'm sure you get that
all the time, though.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.211
[sobbing]:
No...
We just met,

31:05.254 --> 31:07.648
but already
we're so close.No!

31:07.691 --> 31:10.433
[grunts]

31:10.477 --> 31:12.000
I told you I'd get you.

31:13.175 --> 31:14.785
Get up against the car.

31:14.829 --> 31:16.657
[gasps, whimpers]Hey.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.224
[sobbing]It's okay, it's okay.

31:18.267 --> 31:19.878
You're gonna be okay, okay?

31:19.921 --> 31:22.271
You're gonna be okay.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.795
I wasn't gonna hurt her.
I never hurt them.

31:24.839 --> 31:27.363
One more word out of you,
and I'm gonna hurt you.

31:27.407 --> 31:28.799
Scumbag.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.105
[handcuffs clicking]

31:33.674 --> 31:36.807
So, what did you want
to talk to me about, Ms. Reagan?

31:36.851 --> 31:39.810
Mr. Farmer's sentencing
is tomorrow,

31:39.854 --> 31:42.291
and I need to make
a recommendation to the judge.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.598
I thought
we already discussed this.We did.

31:44.641 --> 31:47.209
But things got
a little bit more complicated.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.342
Because of what Farmer did
on the playground.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.695
You suffered a huge loss.Richard Farmer

31:54.738 --> 31:56.610
is responsible.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.917
Yes.You think he deserves

31:58.960 --> 32:02.137
a lighter sentence
because he saved those kids.

32:03.182 --> 32:05.532
Honestly, I don't know
what to think.

32:05.575 --> 32:08.013
It sounds like
you want to be let off the hook.

32:08.056 --> 32:10.102
Look, I'm a prosecutor.

32:10.145 --> 32:12.191
I make tough decisions
every single day,

32:12.234 --> 32:14.193
and then I move on.

32:14.236 --> 32:17.022
It's people like you
and Mr. Farmer

32:17.065 --> 32:20.634
who have to live with the impact
of those decisions.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.418
What do you want from me?

32:22.462 --> 32:24.203
Guidance.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.205
And after everything
you've been through,

32:26.248 --> 32:29.338
I know I don't have
the right to ask, but...

32:29.382 --> 32:31.210
I'm asking.

32:34.387 --> 32:38.173
When I found out
what Farmer did...

32:38.217 --> 32:40.959
I thought about those parents

32:41.002 --> 32:44.788
and how grateful they must be
that their children are alive.

32:46.616 --> 32:49.750
But my child is dead...

32:49.793 --> 32:52.100
and he has to pay for that.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.235
Question is, how much?

32:57.453 --> 33:00.239
And as the living victim
in this case,

33:00.282 --> 33:03.329
I'm gonna leave
that decision up to you.

33:20.955 --> 33:22.609
We heard Gordon

33:22.652 --> 33:24.045
regained consciousness.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.178
Doc says he's gonna be okay.

33:26.221 --> 33:27.570
That's great news.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.224
He remember anything?

33:29.268 --> 33:31.052
Didn't ask.When I take
his statement,

33:31.096 --> 33:33.228
is he gonna tell me you
weren't there when he got shot?

33:33.272 --> 33:35.187
Witnesses confirm it.

33:37.624 --> 33:40.409
Where were you, Raymond?

33:43.630 --> 33:45.327
We were on patrol,

33:45.371 --> 33:47.590
and I wanted a pack of gum,

33:47.634 --> 33:50.506
so I went into the bodega
on the corner.

33:50.550 --> 33:52.552
That's when I heard the shot.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.340
And by the time you got out
the perp was already gone?

33:58.384 --> 34:00.690
Gordon was bleeding
on the sidewalk.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.172
I should have been with him.

34:04.216 --> 34:05.782
You didn't do anything wrong.

34:08.220 --> 34:10.004
And you didn't
kill the guy who shot him.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.528
I wanted to.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.574
I just...

34:14.617 --> 34:16.228
couldn't.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.143
That's 'cause you're a good cop.

34:18.186 --> 34:19.970
Who almost got
his partner killed?

34:20.014 --> 34:23.452
What happened was an accident.
Bad timing, nothing more.

34:24.888 --> 34:27.369
I think your partner needs you.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.154
Thank you, sir.

34:47.520 --> 34:50.131
Pardon me,
but it's a fluid situation.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.959
What is?

34:52.002 --> 34:54.788
First came over as shots fired
in Port Authority Bus Terminal.

34:54.831 --> 34:57.704
Where am I headed
all of a sudden?Word just came in

34:57.747 --> 35:00.272
that one of our detectives had
checked in with the desk there

35:00.315 --> 35:01.360
that she was working
plainclothes

35:01.403 --> 35:03.362
on stakeout.So it's officer-involved.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.277
Yes.Likely?

35:05.320 --> 35:07.453
I don't have a status,
except that the plainclothes

35:07.496 --> 35:09.019
was in a wheelchair.

35:13.198 --> 35:16.766
In light of the tragic
consequences of your crime,

35:16.810 --> 35:20.118
I was going to recommend
the maximum sentence.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.424
I understand.However,

35:22.468 --> 35:25.210
in light of your
more recent heroic actions,

35:25.253 --> 35:27.212
this office believes

35:27.255 --> 35:30.128
a lesser sentence
may be appropriate.

35:30.171 --> 35:32.260
That's very generous.

35:32.304 --> 35:34.306
The sentencing guidelines
for vehicular manslaughter...

35:34.349 --> 35:35.524
No.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.483
I'm sorry?

35:37.526 --> 35:40.747
There's no excuse
for what I did,

35:40.790 --> 35:42.314
for the pain I caused.

35:42.357 --> 35:45.621
One selfish,
stupid decision,

35:45.665 --> 35:48.320
and I stole that girl's
future from her.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.670
And her family.

35:50.713 --> 35:54.500
Are you suggesting that I
recommend the maximum sentence?

35:54.543 --> 35:56.850
It's what I deserve.

36:11.604 --> 36:13.562
Ms. Brooks.

36:13.606 --> 36:14.998
What is this?

36:15.042 --> 36:16.522
Diane has been listening in.

36:16.565 --> 36:19.177
Her opinion
is highly relevant here.

36:21.483 --> 36:23.877
The only thing
that's gotten me through this

36:23.920 --> 36:27.097
is the thought of you rotting
in jail for what you did.

36:27.141 --> 36:29.012
I understand.Maybe one day

36:29.056 --> 36:31.972
I'll be able to forgive you
for what you did.

36:32.015 --> 36:33.669
But not today.

36:35.628 --> 36:38.587
But my daughter...

36:38.631 --> 36:42.330
believed in finding
the good in people.

36:43.766 --> 36:46.421
She believed in second chances.

36:51.078 --> 36:52.645
Thank you.

36:53.689 --> 36:55.822
ERIN:
So maybe we can put

36:55.865 --> 36:57.389
our heads together and find

36:57.432 --> 37:00.522
a recommendation that...

37:00.566 --> 37:03.046
we can all live with?

37:27.419 --> 37:29.421
â™ª

37:44.740 --> 37:46.742
Detective.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.222
They called you
up here for this?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.615
It's kind of what I do.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.401
[sighs]

37:53.445 --> 37:57.013
The situation was fluid
because your squad

37:57.057 --> 37:59.538
had no idea
of what you were up to.

37:59.581 --> 38:01.409
Yeah, I can see that.

38:01.453 --> 38:03.368
What were you up to?

38:03.411 --> 38:06.893
I got word the scumbag
who put me in this chair

38:06.936 --> 38:09.374
got bored of laying low upstate.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.550
So I called
my partner.

38:12.768 --> 38:15.118
He was off the clock,
just helping me out.

38:16.163 --> 38:17.904
I see.He covered

38:17.947 --> 38:20.559
the Utica arrival gate,
I covered Troy.

38:20.602 --> 38:23.039
The scumbag came in from Troy.

38:23.083 --> 38:25.825
He made me
as soon as I rolled up on him.

38:25.868 --> 38:28.044
He got a shot off
and nicked me in the wrist,

38:28.088 --> 38:29.959
while I kneecapped him

38:30.003 --> 38:33.136
with the baton and caught him
in the mouth on the way down.

38:34.921 --> 38:37.097
That's very impressive.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.186
But you're on restricted duty.

38:39.229 --> 38:42.276
You're not supposed to be
on the street making collars.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.713
What are you gonna do,
toss me off the job?

38:46.759 --> 38:49.501
I'm not looking for pity.

38:49.544 --> 38:52.852
Or a handout of a desk job.

38:55.898 --> 38:58.466
I don't want to stay
where I'm not wanted.

39:00.207 --> 39:02.949
I'm not gonna
sue the department.

39:07.954 --> 39:10.435
So it's all or nothing.

39:12.698 --> 39:15.483
I've got applications
out to New Haven,

39:15.527 --> 39:17.877
Newark and the Philly PDs.

39:20.009 --> 39:21.446
If you could reach out...

39:21.489 --> 39:23.056
Reach out how?

39:23.099 --> 39:25.145
[chuckles] Like,
"I got this great detective,

39:25.188 --> 39:27.800
but I can't use her
'cause she's in a wheelchair"?

39:32.718 --> 39:34.241
[sighs]

39:34.284 --> 39:37.505
You told me in my office
your partner, Detective Yang,

39:37.549 --> 39:39.551
was willing to ride with you.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.596
He rode with me today.
For free.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.642
I know that.

39:44.643 --> 39:47.254
What if you had to have
a third detective with you

39:47.297 --> 39:48.821
when you were in the field?

39:50.388 --> 39:52.346
I could live with that.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.696
What if you had to prioritize
your safety

39:54.740 --> 39:57.786
and that of your fellow officers
at all times?

39:57.830 --> 40:00.398
I know what I can
and can't do out there.

40:01.616 --> 40:06.142
What if you had to make
weekly reports to me

40:06.186 --> 40:08.406
about your progress?

40:16.283 --> 40:18.459
[sighs]

40:18.503 --> 40:20.069
You'll be the first.

40:20.113 --> 40:23.203
Make it work
so others can follow.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.164
[laughs]

40:30.993 --> 40:32.908
Nice work, Detective.

40:32.952 --> 40:34.649
You just flipped the PC.
