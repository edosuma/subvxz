WEBVTT

00:15.208 --> 00:17.416
-Whoa!

00:19.500 --> 00:21.250
Ah!

00:26.958 --> 00:28.458
-Ah! No!
-Huh?

00:30.583 --> 00:31.500
Ah!

00:32.541 --> 00:33.458
Ouch!

00:46.125 --> 00:47.916
-Hey!

01:04.291 --> 01:05.916
Breakfast, Pugsley.

01:20.000 --> 01:20.833
Whoa!

01:29.166 --> 01:30.416
No!

01:45.625 --> 01:48.833
Not a bad way
to start the day, Pugs--

01:53.708 --> 01:54.541
Morning.

01:54.625 --> 01:55.916
Wait, we have a bath?

02:04.416 --> 02:08.875
No, no, no, no, no. Ooh.

02:08.958 --> 02:11.041
Hmm.

02:13.583 --> 02:16.750
I'm gonna regret that tomorrow.

02:17.541 --> 02:19.541
Ooh. A-ha!

02:19.625 --> 02:22.541
The book!

02:22.625 --> 02:25.166
I think that might be
a bit long for me, Courtney.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.416
I've only just finished
that book Barney gave me

02:27.500 --> 02:29.625
about the overly insatiable caterpillar.

02:29.708 --> 02:32.083
I did not see that twist ending coming.

02:32.666 --> 02:34.291
Spell book, Pugsley.

02:34.375 --> 02:37.958
Uh, B-O-O--

02:38.041 --> 02:41.041
No, no no, no,
as in a book of spells.

02:41.708 --> 02:42.666
But why?

02:42.750 --> 02:44.625
You're a wizard, Pugsley.

02:44.708 --> 02:46.333
Or at least Temeluchus was.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.625
A great powerful demon warlock.

02:48.708 --> 02:51.625
I think you've inherited
more than his ability to walk and talk.

02:51.708 --> 02:53.541
Although, those are pretty cool too.

02:53.625 --> 02:55.708
And we can use your powers to get me home.

02:55.791 --> 02:58.291
Uh, that… It sounds a little dangerous.

02:58.375 --> 03:01.666
But okay. Um, abracadab--

03:01.750 --> 03:04.541
Not that! Anything but that.

03:04.625 --> 03:06.416
You'd never get
the stains out of the carpet.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.000
Hello, who's ready
for some team-building exercises?

03:09.083 --> 03:10.500
-On the beach?

03:10.583 --> 03:12.250
Beach day! Beach day!

03:12.333 --> 03:14.875
Oh, I am so excited for organized fun.

03:14.958 --> 03:17.500
-I'll be working on my tan.

03:17.583 --> 03:21.166
That's weird. Norma should be here by now,
but she's not answering her phone.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.125
Guess we'll just meet her at the beach.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.458
Oh, Norma,
sweetie, it's beautiful.

03:30.541 --> 03:33.083
See, you're gonna have a fun day.

03:33.166 --> 03:34.458
What if they hate me?

03:34.541 --> 03:36.833
You've already been working
with them a week.

03:36.916 --> 03:40.625
And I still don't have any friends,
except maybe Barney.

03:40.708 --> 03:42.458
Well, that's someone.

03:42.541 --> 03:44.750
That's better than summer camp. Remember?

03:44.833 --> 03:46.833
We promised we'd never speak of that.

03:46.916 --> 03:49.541
Norma, Blossom,

03:49.625 --> 03:51.958
I love you,
but I need you to get out of my car.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.041
Mom!

03:53.125 --> 03:56.416
Let me finish.
I need you to get out of this car

03:56.500 --> 03:59.750
because everyone
in here is already your friend.

03:59.833 --> 04:02.500
You need to get out there and charm them.

04:13.041 --> 04:14.125
Hmm.

04:14.958 --> 04:15.833
What's so funny?

04:23.541 --> 04:26.416
Ugh. How has he already made
so many friends?

04:26.500 --> 04:27.833
Hey look, it's Norma.

04:27.916 --> 04:29.541
-Hey.
-Oh, Norma.

04:29.625 --> 04:31.416
I was waiting for you
back at the house. What happened?

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
Anxiety.

04:32.583 --> 04:36.250
Right. Oh. What, really?

04:36.833 --> 04:40.083
New people are scary.
Actually just people. Period.

04:40.166 --> 04:42.750
That's just 'cause
you haven't tried to get to know anyone.

04:42.833 --> 04:44.666
I mean, do you even know their names?

04:45.250 --> 04:46.916
Sure. Ferris Wheel. Burgers.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.125
Health and Safety. Smoothie.
And Deathslide.

04:50.208 --> 04:53.000
Uh, that's just
where they work at the park.

04:53.083 --> 04:56.708
-And that's all I need to know.
-You called me Deathslide? I love that!

04:56.791 --> 04:59.041
Badyah, she needs to learn your real name.

04:59.125 --> 05:02.250
Yeah, my name
just means enlightened genius.

05:02.333 --> 05:03.666
I prefer Deathslide.

05:05.833 --> 05:07.708
I have heard people call me slide master--

05:07.791 --> 05:09.666
Hey, Barney. Come hear this.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.041
Maybe I'll get it put on a T-shirt.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.166
-Don't leave.
-Oh.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.750
-Oh, sure! We can stick together…

05:24.666 --> 05:27.458
Oh, my gosh, is that him?
The teambuilding guy?

05:32.500 --> 05:37.833
Welcome, you beautiful,
unique souls. <i>Namast.</i>

05:39.208 --> 05:42.000
In my current life cycle,
as a team-building guru,

05:42.583 --> 05:45.000
I am called Harmony.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.458
And I've been asked, and paid,

05:47.541 --> 05:53.125
to bring you all together into a family
of love, trust, and improved work ethic,

05:53.208 --> 05:56.500
because teamwork makes the dream work.

05:57.083 --> 06:01.083
Now, everybody,
give yourselves a round of applause.

06:04.333 --> 06:08.958
Our souls. We applaud with our souls.

06:12.583 --> 06:13.750
Am I doing it right?

06:13.833 --> 06:16.208
Oh, what rapturous applause!

06:16.291 --> 06:20.416
It makes me want
to shout, "Hello, Wembley!"

06:21.333 --> 06:22.541
You did shout it.

06:22.625 --> 06:28.000
So who can tell me the single thing
that makes a team bond together?

06:28.083 --> 06:30.250
-Chains?
-Uh, tape?

06:30.333 --> 06:32.000
Is it chains and tape?

06:32.083 --> 06:36.416
Sweet children,
material things cannot bind us.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.625
-They can.
-Shh.

06:38.708 --> 06:42.083
It's trust. Trust is what binds us.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.166
And what is the opposite of trust?

06:44.250 --> 06:45.125
Mistrust.

06:45.958 --> 06:47.000
It's fear!

06:47.583 --> 06:48.541
No, it's definitely mistrust.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.833
Fear is the wall
that's stopping all of you connecting.

06:51.916 --> 06:54.541
Fear is that little monkey
who sits on your shoulder

06:54.625 --> 06:56.541
telling you not to embrace each other.

07:00.375 --> 07:01.958
Fear.

07:04.541 --> 07:06.333
And today, we've got to grab

07:06.416 --> 07:09.375
that little fear monkey
and toss them into the ocean.

07:09.458 --> 07:10.875
Poor little guy.

07:10.958 --> 07:13.291
And defeating these invisible fear monkeys

07:13.375 --> 07:16.708
will make me a better
theme park security guard, how?

07:16.791 --> 07:18.875
That is up to you, friend.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.041
Pfft.

07:22.333 --> 07:26.333
So our first exercise,
a personal favorite of mine,

07:26.416 --> 07:28.625
the Maze of Trust.

07:30.541 --> 07:33.791
Yeah, okay. That's it.
That's it, Josh. Keep it coming.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.875
-Uh-huh. Okay, now left leg up.

07:35.958 --> 07:38.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.
Oh! Okay. There you go. You did it!

07:38.958 --> 07:39.833
Yes!

07:39.916 --> 07:43.416
Okay, Norma, now,
slowly raise your left leg.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.625
I mean a little bit faster, maybe?

07:46.708 --> 07:49.750
Come on, back it up. Back it up.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.625
I'm okay.

07:55.625 --> 07:59.333
Next up, the Stare of Trust,
because as we all know,

07:59.416 --> 08:03.166
the eyes are the windows to the soul.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.875
Norma, I feel like
you're not taking this seriously.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.791
What makes you say that?

08:13.875 --> 08:17.000
Next up, the Fall of Trust.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.250
Why did you do that?

08:22.333 --> 08:23.958
I couldn't be sure
you'd catch me.

08:24.041 --> 08:27.791
And finally, the Human Knot of Trust.

08:31.666 --> 08:36.000
Only by working together
can you untangle yourselves.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.125
Okay.
How we gonna do this?

08:38.208 --> 08:41.291
No, if you guys hold still,
I'll go under here like this.

08:41.375 --> 08:43.083
Okay, whose hand have I got here?

08:43.166 --> 08:44.708
-Mine, I think.
-Oh, hi.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.250
Uh, okay, uh, Norma,
maybe you need to go--

08:47.333 --> 08:48.916
-Huh.
-If you go in the middle…

08:49.000 --> 08:52.041
Untwist as you go.
Nope, that's not quite right.

08:53.875 --> 08:54.791
-Try to go down.
-Huh!

08:54.875 --> 08:56.500
Excuse me! Coming through.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.333
-Whatcha doing, Norma?

09:03.125 --> 09:06.333
-Huh?
-Why are you so full of fear, Norma?

09:12.500 --> 09:13.708
Stop!

09:16.875 --> 09:18.583
What's the matter with her?

09:18.666 --> 09:20.541
Norma? Norma, are you okay?

09:20.625 --> 09:22.500
Come on, take my hand.

09:22.583 --> 09:27.583
Stop looking at me!
Please, just…

09:28.333 --> 09:32.625
Ah, the smell of fear.

09:36.458 --> 09:38.125
I'm so stupid.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.458
No, you're not.

09:40.541 --> 09:42.416
Maybe I am full of fear.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.958
Life coach spotted it.

09:45.041 --> 09:46.625
He shouldn't have said that.

09:46.708 --> 09:49.708
I just don't understand
how this is easy for everyone.

09:49.791 --> 09:51.750
Well, I'm just really good at everything.

09:51.833 --> 09:54.750
I mean making friends, socializing.

09:54.833 --> 09:56.500
Barney is so good at it.

09:57.541 --> 09:59.125
But not me.

09:59.208 --> 10:01.041
You're different people, though.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.416
Why are you putting
so much pressure on yourself?

10:03.500 --> 10:04.708
You sound like Harmony.

10:06.125 --> 10:08.541
Come on,
then, you brave, unique soul.

10:08.625 --> 10:11.250
Don't let that
inner saboteur pin you down.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.625
It's almost time
for another pointless game.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.500
Come on, then.

10:23.833 --> 10:25.875
So hope you all enjoyed the warm ups.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.416
"Warm ups"?

10:30.083 --> 10:33.833
Now we begin the real work
to defeat your fears.

10:33.916 --> 10:38.208
You're gonna need to dig into the deepest,
darkest place inside you.

10:38.291 --> 10:41.250
Find your greatest fear.

10:46.208 --> 10:49.041
And now feed it to the skull.

10:49.125 --> 10:50.625
Skull?

10:50.708 --> 10:52.541
That can't be normal.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.583
I always bring a skull to a party.

10:54.666 --> 10:55.541
Okay, not normal.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.541
Please, feed your fear to the skull.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.333
Do I… Do I…

11:02.291 --> 11:04.041
Can… can I… Hmm.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.291
Give it here, I'll go first.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.500
So what do I do now?

11:09.166 --> 11:11.750
Three, two, one.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.333
Huh?

11:16.416 --> 11:17.416
Uh…

11:19.250 --> 11:20.708
Oh, huh.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.625
Oh. Uh…

11:26.958 --> 11:27.791
Um…

11:43.791 --> 11:45.625
Uh, Badyah?

11:46.791 --> 11:48.458
Think fast, puppy dog.

11:55.166 --> 11:56.916
Huh?

12:12.416 --> 12:13.625
Ahhh!

12:25.708 --> 12:27.416
Buddy, it's okay.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.250
Hey, excuse me.
As Health and Safety officer,

12:31.333 --> 12:34.083
I think it's my duty
to check this skull is… Ooh!

12:37.000 --> 12:38.416
-Huh?

12:49.916 --> 12:53.083
No!

12:56.291 --> 12:59.291
You think I'm scared of that thing? Huh.

12:59.375 --> 13:01.791
My… my face.

13:01.875 --> 13:06.666
My beautiful symmetrical face!

13:06.750 --> 13:10.208
Josh? Josh, what are you seeing? Uh, guys?

13:10.291 --> 13:13.791
Ketchup!
No! Anything but ketchup!

13:13.875 --> 13:16.041
-Hmm.

13:16.916 --> 13:18.083
-Come on, buddy.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.458
Barney. Barney, look.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.833
Something is up with this Harmony guy.

13:21.916 --> 13:24.125
Ah, Norma. No talking in class.

13:24.208 --> 13:27.083
-Yoo-hoo, Mr. Blue.
-No, don't touch it!

13:36.791 --> 13:38.916
I don't get it.
What are you afraid of here?

13:39.875 --> 13:41.250
Is it the beef brisket?

13:47.291 --> 13:49.000
Okay, not the brisket.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.416
Grammy Gram, stop.

13:51.541 --> 13:54.500
-Dad? Dad, make it stop.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.500
Mom, aren't you gonna say something?

14:02.875 --> 14:04.291
Grammy Gram, stop!

14:04.375 --> 14:06.416
Barney, this isn't real. Trust me.

14:10.791 --> 14:12.583
Why do they let her do this?

14:12.666 --> 14:14.500
Why can't they hear
what she's saying to me?

14:14.583 --> 14:17.708
-Barney, come on. This isn't real, Barney.

14:19.125 --> 14:23.041
Hey, you! Beat it! Leave him alone!

14:32.708 --> 14:34.416
Norma, when did you get here?

14:34.500 --> 14:36.458
I've been here the whole time. Come on.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.208
Hey, Norma, you did it. You got me out!

14:42.458 --> 14:44.791
Pugsley. Pugsley, come back. Come here.

14:45.375 --> 14:48.625
I saw your fear when we both touched
the skull at the same time.

14:52.791 --> 14:53.875
If the three of us touch it,

14:53.958 --> 14:56.208
then I think we can get
to Pugsley's world, too.

14:56.291 --> 14:59.500
Okay. Hang in there, buddy.
We'll be right back.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.583
Hey!

15:14.041 --> 15:15.750
Pugsley! Pugsley!

15:16.333 --> 15:19.583
Pugs, it's not real! It's just your fears.

15:19.666 --> 15:20.708
Pugs. Okay?

15:23.458 --> 15:28.208
Real, not real.
Only mortals deal in absolutes.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.875
You two have been holding me back! Enough!

15:37.708 --> 15:39.291
-Norma!
-Barney!

15:43.208 --> 15:45.583
Pugsley, do something!

15:45.666 --> 15:49.166
Don't call me that. My name is Temeluchus!

15:51.416 --> 15:52.458
Norma!

15:54.416 --> 15:56.333
She can't help you now.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.250
-Oh.
-See! It's not real.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.708
This isn't you, Pugsley!

16:01.791 --> 16:04.125
You would never
put your friends in danger like this.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.500
Come on, buddy.
We need to go help the others.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.625
-Come on. I know you're in there.

16:13.708 --> 16:15.333
You can do it, Pugsley. Break free.

16:15.416 --> 16:17.375
I know you've got it. Come on.

16:18.666 --> 16:21.208
Pugsley! Come on, boy.

16:26.833 --> 16:28.666
-Barney! Over here, quick!

16:28.750 --> 16:31.875
We have to help Courtney.
We need to go, come on!

16:32.583 --> 16:34.458
Hey! Don't mess with the skull, guys.

16:34.541 --> 16:35.708
Guh, come back.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.583
This one is very literal.

16:42.666 --> 16:44.416
I guess Courtney's scared of going home.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.458
But getting home
was her biggest wish.

16:46.541 --> 16:48.083
Why would she be scared?

16:48.166 --> 16:50.250
-Wait! No!
-Courtney?

16:50.333 --> 16:51.875
Let me out! Let me out!

16:51.958 --> 16:53.583
No, no!

16:53.666 --> 16:57.125
Let me out! Let me out!

17:09.500 --> 17:10.750
Come on, she's trapped in there!

17:10.833 --> 17:13.416
Hi-yah!

17:16.458 --> 17:17.541
Ow.

17:17.625 --> 17:20.833
Oh, wait! This is a fear world.

17:20.916 --> 17:24.750
If fear gives it power,
what if we just don't let it get to us?

17:24.833 --> 17:26.416
Easier said than done.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.333
Huh?

17:34.083 --> 17:38.166
Yeah, yeah, let's all laugh at Courtney,
afraid she'll never get home.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.708
You're okay. You got us now.

17:40.791 --> 17:42.208
We'll never leave you.

17:42.291 --> 17:45.708
That's what I'm scared of. Aww.

17:46.291 --> 17:49.958
Yes,
feed me your fears!

17:50.041 --> 17:51.541
Who are you?

17:52.625 --> 17:54.000
I'm Harmony.

17:54.083 --> 17:54.916
Ugh!

17:55.000 --> 17:58.125
Okay, what are you?
You're a demon, aren't you?

17:58.208 --> 18:03.083
Perhaps. And I'm on a strictly
all-fear diet at the moment.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.916
Humans are riddled with it,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.208
so I thought this would be
the best spot for brunch.

18:08.708 --> 18:10.625
It is my cheat day after all.

18:10.708 --> 18:13.208
What kind of name is Harmony for a demon?

18:13.291 --> 18:17.708
No, no, no, no.
it's Harm Many. Harm. Many.

18:17.791 --> 18:20.708
Because of how many people I harm.

18:22.208 --> 18:24.291
Oh, it doesn't matter.

18:24.375 --> 18:26.708
The main thing is this.

18:36.375 --> 18:39.166
-Demon enough for you?

18:39.750 --> 18:43.208
This form used to be enough
to bring my victims' fears to the surface.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.666
But you kids and your horror films!

18:45.750 --> 18:47.416
I've had to up my game.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.583
Your turn, Norma.

18:49.250 --> 18:52.666
You managed to help your friends
out of their fear worlds,

18:52.750 --> 18:55.041
but can you deal with your own?

18:55.833 --> 18:57.208
Yes, I can.

18:57.291 --> 18:58.708
Excellent.

18:58.791 --> 19:03.541
They were just an appetizer.
You will be a banquet!

19:03.625 --> 19:05.625
Oh, yeah? Then…

19:05.708 --> 19:08.125
Then if I go in,
you let everyone else out.

19:11.041 --> 19:11.875
Deal.

19:11.958 --> 19:13.750
No, no, Norma! Don't do that!

19:13.833 --> 19:14.833
Bon appétit!

19:18.666 --> 19:20.791
You need to get out there
and charm them.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.333
What's so funny, huh?

19:31.416 --> 19:34.708
That's it. Show me your fears.

19:38.791 --> 19:41.500
Where've you been?
I was waiting at the house.

19:41.583 --> 19:44.250
-Anxiety.

19:45.500 --> 19:49.500
Yes, that's it. Feed me. Feed me!

19:50.125 --> 19:52.458
<i>Do you even know anybody's name?</i>

19:53.291 --> 19:54.750
Have you seen Norma?

20:02.750 --> 20:05.958
Oh, there's nothing you can do.
Her fears are too strong.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.458
Remember, Norma, it's only the fear world.
You can fight it.

20:11.541 --> 20:14.000
You don't understand!

20:14.083 --> 20:17.083
My fear world is the real world.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.458
-Huh?
-Huh?

20:21.541 --> 20:23.000
That's impossible.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.000
Whoa.

20:44.541 --> 20:48.041
Ah! No, no. Stop it. Huh?
What's happening?

20:59.666 --> 21:01.833
No, please, no. No, stop!

21:16.166 --> 21:17.041
Whoa.

21:17.583 --> 21:20.625
You had so much fear that he exploded?

21:20.708 --> 21:22.291
That's one way of doin' it.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.708
Huh?

21:30.708 --> 21:33.166
I had no idea
that's what you were going through.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.416
Your fears are so intense.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.208
I'm scared of the real world, Barney.

21:37.958 --> 21:40.375
And that's already everywhere.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.791
Whoa.
My fear seems so silly now.

21:42.875 --> 21:46.291
What? Your grandmother
was terrifying. I totally get it.

21:46.375 --> 21:49.500
Uh, I'm not scared of my grandma.

21:49.583 --> 21:52.416
I'm scared that my parents
don't have my back.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.416
-Well, I've got your back.
-Hmm, same.

21:55.500 --> 21:58.375
Baby steps.

22:00.375 --> 22:01.333
Do you normally play?

22:01.416 --> 22:03.416
Yeah, I'm not very good at it.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.375
If you could teach me the ropes?

22:06.916 --> 22:07.791
Hey.

22:07.875 --> 22:08.791
Hi.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.458
You want to play? It's a really great game

22:11.541 --> 22:14.958
where your forearms get red and sore
and you get lots of sand in your eyes,

22:15.041 --> 22:17.125
but for a split second,
you feel like you're in an '80s movie.

22:17.208 --> 22:19.333
I don't know.

22:19.416 --> 22:21.916
My hand-eye coordination
is pretty bad.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.583
Remind me not to let you
operate the big rides.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.958
-You sure?
-Maybe next time?

22:28.041 --> 22:28.875
Okay.

22:29.541 --> 22:30.625
Hey, Norma!

22:33.625 --> 22:35.166
I know what this is gonna sound like,

22:35.250 --> 22:38.875
but working at Phoenix Parks
is my dream come true.

22:38.958 --> 22:42.166
I can deal with the job.
I can even deal with the demons.

22:42.250 --> 22:43.750
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

22:43.833 --> 22:46.958
In fact,
I think I'm pretty good at it.

22:47.041 --> 22:49.375
But it's all this stuff that I find hard.

22:49.458 --> 22:52.625
People are funny. Not "ha-ha funny."

22:52.708 --> 22:54.750
Just… They don't make sense.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.416
And half the time, I don't either.

22:57.083 --> 22:59.958
What I'm trying to say is,
I'm glad I've got you guys.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.958
Yours! Oh, oh, watch out!

23:03.041 --> 23:04.750
-Huh?
-Watch out, Norma!

23:08.125 --> 23:10.416
Awesome.
