00:23.670 --> 00:25.269
I was just...

00:27.179 --> 00:31.500
Even in our most private moments,
someone is watching us.

00:34.299 --> 00:35.700
Shall we join the others?

00:50.140 --> 00:52.700
That's lovely, ladies.

00:52.740 --> 00:57.018
One more for luck. This is for the
front page, after all.

00:57.020 --> 00:58.060
CAMERA CLICKS

00:58.100 --> 00:59.619
I can't thank you enough.

01:01.100 --> 01:04.617
With this money, the mobile library
service will be able to

01:04.620 --> 01:08.138
deliver a free book to every
child in the district.

01:08.140 --> 01:11.939
But the real praise should go to our
generous congregation,

01:11.980 --> 01:15.099
who have baked and baked
and sold enough cakes

01:15.140 --> 01:17.299
to feed Kembleford ten times over!

01:24.819 --> 01:26.659
Do you mind?

01:29.859 --> 01:31.739
What did I say about
upsetting the clients?

01:31.780 --> 01:32.939
Sorry, Mr Cartwright.

01:32.979 --> 01:36.219
Get the kit in the car and stop
making a nuisance of yourself!

01:44.780 --> 01:46.379
My apologies, madam.

01:46.420 --> 01:48.979
How's about I do you a discount on
one of our portrait packages

01:49.020 --> 01:52.060
by way of compensation?

01:52.099 --> 01:54.859
I can see you'd be
a natural in front of the camera.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.979
Not if you were the last
photographer on earth.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.340
SHE CHUCKLES

02:10.378 --> 02:11.979
Father Brown, just a word?

02:13.620 --> 02:15.819
I promised to help
with the refreshments.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.860
Oh, it will only take a minute.

02:17.900 --> 02:21.938
Em, I was looking at our
lending log, and...

02:21.939 --> 02:24.340
Well, yes, when I think
about it, I...

02:25.819 --> 02:30.060
I may have one or two overdue items.
One or two?

02:45.699 --> 02:48.740
Little did I know I've spent all
this time working alongside

02:48.780 --> 02:51.379
the Great Kembleford Book Thief!

02:51.420 --> 02:54.020
I've been meaning to take them
back for weeks.

02:54.060 --> 02:58.060
Huh, codswallop! You are a hoarder,
that's what you are.

02:58.099 --> 03:00.739
I only hope you have enough money
in your pocket

03:00.740 --> 03:03.098
to cover all those fines.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.459
I thought there might be
a discount for the clergy.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.020
WOMAN SCREAMS

03:07.060 --> 03:09.259
Quick!
There's been a dreadful accident!

03:15.379 --> 03:17.460
I only popped out to deliver the
latest Graham Greene

03:17.500 --> 03:19.979
to Mr Entwhistle.
And when I got back...

03:21.780 --> 03:23.060
She's dead, isn't she?

03:56.180 --> 03:59.420
Thank you, Doctor. I'll telephone
the surgery if we need you.

03:59.460 --> 04:00.900
You're welcome.

04:03.099 --> 04:06.658
Well, Margaret,
it seems you're very fortunate.

04:06.659 --> 04:08.139
SHE SIGHS

04:08.180 --> 04:10.419
I don't know. Come, come.

04:10.419 --> 04:13.219
No broken bones. And didn't the
doctor say you'll be

04:13.259 --> 04:16.178
back on your feet
in a couple of days?

04:16.180 --> 04:17.899
Have you remembered anything?

04:19.180 --> 04:22.658
Well... It's all a bit of a blur.

04:22.660 --> 04:27.819
Ada wasn't hurt, was she?
She wasn't there when it happened.

04:27.860 --> 04:30.579
It was Miss Rawlins who found you
and then called for help.

04:30.579 --> 04:32.540
I've always said
that van's a deathtrap.

04:32.579 --> 04:34.740
It's not been serviced in years.

04:34.779 --> 04:37.180
Graham, will you stop
going on about it?

04:39.060 --> 04:42.100
And it's just a... It's a silly
accident, that's all.

04:43.180 --> 04:45.139
And you're not to worry about
the mobile library.

04:45.180 --> 04:48.180
Because I'm going to step into the
breach until you're feeling better.

04:48.220 --> 04:49.579
Well, that won't be necessary,

04:49.579 --> 04:51.659
because I will be
fine in a couple of...

04:53.379 --> 04:55.579
What you need is a good, long rest.

04:55.579 --> 04:59.340
And in any case, I've always thought
I had the temperament

04:59.379 --> 05:01.459
to make rather a good librarian.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.500
It's true.
She's often telling me to be quiet.

05:05.860 --> 05:08.620
I'm the only one who can get
the van started.

05:08.660 --> 05:10.819
It's a very specific knack.

05:10.860 --> 05:13.540
Well, you're going to have to teach
me, then, aren't you?

05:17.860 --> 05:21.459
Well, if you insist.
But just for a couple of days.

05:28.019 --> 05:32.019
Make sure she stays in that bed
until she's properly recovered.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.459
Ho-ho, you've clearly never tried
telling my wife what to do!

05:34.459 --> 05:36.740
Mr Cartwright? Yes, Lewis!

05:36.779 --> 05:40.338
How's Mrs Cartwright?
Bruised, battered but unbowed.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.538
Glad to hear it.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.819
I was wondering, is it all right if
I use the darkroom after hours?

05:45.819 --> 05:47.860
As long as
the studio work's finished.

05:47.899 --> 05:49.316
But tidy up after yourself
this time,

05:49.340 --> 05:50.755
it was in a right state
this morning.

05:50.779 --> 05:52.740
But I... Lewis!

05:52.779 --> 05:55.860
Sorry, Mr Cartwright.
I'll leave it exactly as I find it.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.100
Is he one of yours? Lewis? Yes.

06:01.139 --> 06:03.620
Yes, he's been coming to
St Mary's for years.

06:03.660 --> 06:06.379
Well, if you find his brain
in your lost property,

06:06.420 --> 06:08.620
do return it to its rightful owner.

06:15.579 --> 06:17.779
What a wonderful word.

06:17.819 --> 06:22.819
Cacoethes. "A sudden urge to do
something inadvisable."

06:22.860 --> 06:26.298
Is there any chance you might get
a "sudden urge" to give us a hand?

06:26.300 --> 06:29.339
Why don't we stay closed until
Mrs Cartwright's better?

06:29.379 --> 06:32.980
And leave the elderly and infirm
without the comfort of a good book?

06:33.019 --> 06:34.740
Over my dead body.

06:34.779 --> 06:37.098
And here we have our first customer!

06:37.100 --> 06:39.379
Actually, I'm here to see
Miss Rawlins.

06:39.420 --> 06:41.178
I'm working, Lewis.

06:41.180 --> 06:44.980
Later then? We need to talk.
It's important.

06:46.420 --> 06:48.899
Stop by the studio after work?
Maybe.

06:53.980 --> 06:57.980
Mmm. Playing hard to get, eh?
I approve.

06:58.019 --> 06:59.819
If you don't mind, it's private.

07:03.699 --> 07:05.899
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

07:05.939 --> 07:08.699
It's been one week
since my last confession.

07:13.019 --> 07:14.819
God is listening.

07:14.860 --> 07:17.459
It's... I-I've got this secret.

07:18.579 --> 07:21.660
And it's not just me, there are
other people involved.

07:21.699 --> 07:25.180
I don't know what to do,
I'm so confused.

07:27.459 --> 07:30.860
The Seal of the Confessional
is absolute.

07:30.899 --> 07:33.259
You can be honest before God.

07:35.579 --> 07:38.699
Why are you confused?

07:38.740 --> 07:42.939
Well, when Adam first saw Eve,
she was naked, right?

07:45.340 --> 07:49.338
Yes. So... was that a sin?

07:49.340 --> 07:51.899
For him to look at her, I mean.

07:51.899 --> 07:56.060
No. He looked upon her in innocence.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.939
Because the thing is,
a little while ago...
DOOR SLAMS

07:58.939 --> 08:00.620
FOOTSTEPS

08:00.660 --> 08:01.860
THEY CHATTER

08:03.420 --> 08:04.500
Sorry, I can't!

08:49.940 --> 08:53.460
All right there? Oh, can I help you?

08:53.500 --> 08:58.019
I was looking for something on
butterflies. Butterflies?

08:58.059 --> 09:01.779
Yeah, butterflies. Ah.

09:01.820 --> 09:04.099
Can you be any more specific?

09:04.100 --> 09:07.980
Well, I'm quite fond of the more
exotic species.

09:08.019 --> 09:11.419
Ah, I meant are you looking for
a reference book or..?

09:11.460 --> 09:13.619
Oh, ah - I almost forgot.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.139
HE CHUCKLES

09:19.179 --> 09:20.538
I don't understand.

09:20.539 --> 09:22.219
Can I help with anything?

09:22.220 --> 09:24.658
Eh, I was just paying
my overdue fees.

09:24.659 --> 09:27.099
He's looking for something
on butterflies.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.820
I'll come back another time.
Oh, no, it's no trouble.

09:29.860 --> 09:32.298
No, I just remembered somewhere
I have to be.

09:32.299 --> 09:35.019
You probably don't remember me,
Mrs McCarthy.

09:35.019 --> 09:37.499
How could I forget you, Harold?

09:37.500 --> 09:41.259
I'm very good with faces, and of
course we were extremely grateful

09:41.299 --> 09:45.539
for your assistance when Father
Brown had his little spot of bother.

09:45.580 --> 09:49.419
It were my pleasure. And may I say
how lovely you're looking today?

09:53.899 --> 09:55.299
CLATTERING

09:55.340 --> 09:57.539
CAT MEOWS

09:57.580 --> 10:00.179
BREATHLESS: What was that?
It was just a cat.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.059
HEAVY BUMP

10:04.100 --> 10:05.460
That's no cat.

10:13.059 --> 10:17.259
Graham. Graham, what are you doing?

10:17.299 --> 10:19.259
No!
GLASS SMASHES

10:19.299 --> 10:20.419
You stay up here.

10:22.139 --> 10:25.500
(Graham, you can't do that!
You'll get hurt!)

10:29.860 --> 10:31.620
PAINED GROANS

10:33.539 --> 10:35.299
Is someone down here?

10:38.580 --> 10:40.059
Argh...

10:47.740 --> 10:49.220
PANTING: Lewis.

10:57.299 --> 10:59.100
There you go, sir.

10:59.139 --> 11:00.860
Thank you, Sergeant.

11:02.580 --> 11:06.659
Why can't people do the decent thing
and die at a more sociable hour?

11:07.860 --> 11:10.220
Best time of the day
if you ask me, Inspector.

11:10.259 --> 11:12.298
BIRDSONG AND BELLS TOLL

11:12.299 --> 11:14.700
Looks straightforward enough.

11:14.740 --> 11:18.179
Looks like this Lewis lad decides to
help himself to some of

11:18.220 --> 11:23.059
his employer's valuables,
photographic equipment probably.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.500
Disturbed in the act, he goes to
attack and comes off worse.

11:26.539 --> 11:30.340
Reasonable self-defence,
if you ask me. If you say so, sir.

11:30.379 --> 11:31.460
I do, Sergeant.

11:33.980 --> 11:36.698
Tell the boys to finish up here
and we'll take Mr Cartwright

11:36.700 --> 11:39.059
down the station to make
a formal statement.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.539
Any luck, we'll have the paperwork
wrapped up before breakfast.

11:42.580 --> 11:46.179
What about last rites, sir?
I notice he's wearing a crucifix.

11:46.220 --> 11:48.019
Doesn't necessarily mean...

11:49.700 --> 11:53.220
No, you're absolutely right,
Sergeant.

11:53.259 --> 11:58.419
Obviously I'd hate to wake the Padre
up so early, but if needs must...

12:05.299 --> 12:07.259
KNOCK ON DOOR

12:07.259 --> 12:08.340
'Margaret?'

12:10.019 --> 12:11.620
Father.

12:13.460 --> 12:16.259
Are the police still downstairs?

12:16.299 --> 12:18.100
Yes, but I doubt they'll be long.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.899
Inspector Mallory told me what
happened. How are you holding up?

12:23.940 --> 12:26.220
I am very concerned about Graham.

12:27.940 --> 12:31.539
The inspector said that
he was defending himself.

12:31.580 --> 12:35.139
I'm afraid that the shock of this is
going to push him back into his...

12:37.059 --> 12:40.620
Well... Less than Christian habits.

12:40.659 --> 12:42.698
By which you mean?

12:42.700 --> 12:45.580
Well, it's no secret
that Graham liked a drink.

12:45.620 --> 12:47.179
And I can cope with that.

12:48.820 --> 12:51.419
But it's the gambling
that frightens me.

12:53.299 --> 12:55.899
When I think of the life we
could have had,

12:55.899 --> 12:58.340
if all that money hadn't been
washed down the drain.

12:58.379 --> 13:01.740
Instead I'm living in a flat,
above a shop with a leaky roof

13:01.779 --> 13:04.820
and a... rat infestation!

13:04.860 --> 13:07.059
I'll talk to him.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.299
Would you, Father?
I'd be so grateful.

13:10.340 --> 13:15.659
The Inspector said that young
Mr Ward was burgling,

13:15.700 --> 13:18.658
and, erm...

13:18.659 --> 13:20.899
I'm surprised by that.

13:20.940 --> 13:24.338
I'm not. He was a strange boy.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.578
In fact, I never knew why
Graham took him on.

13:26.580 --> 13:28.980
I couldn't see any sign of
forced entry.

13:29.019 --> 13:31.220
Well, Lewis had his own key.

13:31.259 --> 13:35.500
Yeah, well, sometimes Graham let him
work late on his own projects.

13:35.539 --> 13:37.700
So he could simply have
been going home?

13:39.620 --> 13:43.059
Lewis always used the back door at
night so as not to disturb us.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.620
If he was in the studio,
he was up to no good!

13:50.139 --> 13:51.580
SOBBING

13:53.740 --> 13:57.019
Oh, dear. Come and sit down.

13:59.100 --> 14:02.500
I'm sorry. It's just such a shock.

14:02.539 --> 14:04.740
Were you two...?

14:04.779 --> 14:06.779
Lewis and I went out
a couple of times.

14:08.220 --> 14:11.419
Something happened.
It's complicated.

14:11.460 --> 14:12.818
Love always is.

14:12.820 --> 14:15.700
Harold. Have you come back
for that book?

14:15.740 --> 14:19.379
Actually, it turns out
I'd forgotten that I'd already

14:19.419 --> 14:22.179
paid my fine.
Brain like a sieve, me.

14:22.220 --> 14:26.899
So I was wondering if I could have
my half-crown back?

14:26.899 --> 14:31.139
Eh, well, the fine box
is emptied overnight,

14:31.179 --> 14:34.619
to avoid anyone being tempted to
break into the van.

14:34.620 --> 14:38.860
Well, in that case, maybe you can
recommend something to me.

14:38.899 --> 14:41.899
What's your favourite book?
The Bible.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.179
Ah. The Song of Solomon - beautiful.

14:49.460 --> 14:51.860
Ah, ladies.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.379
Mr Slow.

14:57.259 --> 14:59.620
Ada, may I have a quick word?

15:03.659 --> 15:06.299
Lewis wouldn't steal from
Mr Cartwright. He wasn't like that.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.899
I agree.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.058
Was he troubled about anything?

15:12.059 --> 15:15.058
Not that I know of.
Why do you ask?

15:15.059 --> 15:16.620
He came to see me yesterday.

15:17.899 --> 15:20.058
What about? I can't say.

15:20.059 --> 15:22.458
Can you think of any reason
why he might have been

15:22.460 --> 15:24.059
in the studio last night?

15:25.860 --> 15:27.698
Sorry.

15:27.700 --> 15:31.659
I wish I could be more help, Father,
but I've got to get back to work.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.580
A quiet little mouse, isn't she?

15:38.620 --> 15:40.019
Who'd have thought she'd be

15:40.019 --> 15:42.860
romantically involved
with a criminal?

15:42.899 --> 15:45.299
I've known Lewis since he was
a little boy.

15:47.259 --> 15:49.500
He was not a burglar.

15:50.740 --> 15:53.220
Have you checked his photographs?

15:53.259 --> 15:56.860
From what I saw, he never went
anywhere without his camera.

15:56.899 --> 16:00.700
If something untoward was going on,
he probably took a picture of it.

16:39.700 --> 16:43.179
MARGARET: Graham! Is that you?

16:43.220 --> 16:46.019
No, it's Father Brown.

16:46.059 --> 16:49.259
Erm, I left my stole here.

16:49.299 --> 16:52.139
Have those officers gone yet?

16:52.179 --> 16:53.700
Yes, I believe so.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.419
Shall I make you a cup of tea?

16:58.460 --> 17:01.139
That'd be lovely.

17:01.179 --> 17:02.899
I'll put the kettle on then.

17:02.899 --> 17:04.500
Thank you, Father.

17:08.900 --> 17:12.858
Thank you for your cooperation.
Can't have been very pleasant.

17:12.900 --> 17:16.538
I'm more concerned about the lad's
family. Have they been informed?

17:16.539 --> 17:18.137
I can put your mind
at rest there, sir.

17:18.140 --> 17:19.539
He was an orphan.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.380
Do you need someone to
drop you home, sir?

17:21.420 --> 17:23.940
No, no, thank you.
The walk will do me good.

17:23.980 --> 17:25.019
Right you are.

17:25.059 --> 17:27.617
Hopefully we shan't have to bother
you about this any more.

17:27.618 --> 17:29.259
PHONE RINGS

17:29.299 --> 17:30.900
Kembleford Police Station?

17:32.180 --> 17:34.579
Oh, right. And your name, sir?

17:37.900 --> 17:39.980
Uh-huh.

18:11.660 --> 18:14.619
Oh... you poor boy.

18:41.460 --> 18:43.220
SHOP BELL JINGLES

18:52.220 --> 18:54.579
I didn't know you were
still here, Father.

18:56.660 --> 19:00.299
I was going to make Mrs Cartwright
a cup of tea. Would you like one?

19:00.339 --> 19:02.539
That's kind of you to offer,
but I'll do it.

19:02.579 --> 19:04.380
Why don't you get off?

19:04.420 --> 19:06.779
No doubt you've got better
things to be doing?

19:10.180 --> 19:15.220
Erm, I'll pop back later, see if
you're both all right.

19:15.259 --> 19:16.819
Good.

19:32.940 --> 19:38.059
Now, I have transferred the
Ĺ12, two shillings and sixpence...

19:38.099 --> 19:40.940
What on earth are you doing?!

19:40.980 --> 19:45.019
Making a darkroom.
Oh, yes, of course you are(!)

19:45.019 --> 19:48.019
These are all the books they had
on amateur photography.

19:48.059 --> 19:50.059
I'm sure they'll be fine.

19:50.099 --> 19:52.460
Is anybody going to tell
me what is going on?

19:55.380 --> 19:57.980
I found a box of negatives
hidden in the darkroom.

19:59.460 --> 20:03.740
And I saw Lewis Ward holding them
the day before he died.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.779
Erm, if you don't mind, ladies.

20:10.819 --> 20:12.380
Oh. Oh.

20:12.420 --> 20:16.898
And please, do not open the door
until I ask you,

20:16.900 --> 20:20.019
lest the light
shine upon the darkness.

20:25.619 --> 20:26.940
MRS MCCARTHY SIGHS

20:26.980 --> 20:28.900
How long does all this take?

20:32.660 --> 20:34.660
Ah. Well?

20:38.859 --> 20:41.059
Oh. But they're not wearing...

20:42.700 --> 20:44.700
Heavens above. My goodness.

20:44.740 --> 20:46.900
You have to inform the police. Why?

20:48.619 --> 20:51.779
Lewis is dead, and the girls in
these photographs won't thank us

20:51.819 --> 20:53.619
for exposing them.

20:53.660 --> 20:55.859
By the looks of it,
they're quite used to being exposed.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.500
Being exploited, more like.

20:59.579 --> 21:02.579
Do you think this
has anything to do with his death?

21:02.619 --> 21:06.259
Lewis Ward, the pornographer.
Well, he certainly kept that quiet.

21:07.579 --> 21:10.579
Well, he's hardly going to shout it
from the rooftops.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.298
Why didn't he shout?

21:15.299 --> 21:17.419
Well, because... No, I mean...

21:17.420 --> 21:22.819
Mr Cartwright said that
he shouted out to ask who was there.

21:22.859 --> 21:24.700
Why didn't Lewis reply?

21:24.740 --> 21:28.140
Isn't it obvious?
Because he was up to no good!

21:28.180 --> 21:30.420
But Lewis didn't have anything
of value on him.

21:30.460 --> 21:33.660
Mr Cartwright said he was crashing
around like a drunken rhinoceros.

21:33.700 --> 21:35.700
That's hardly the actions
of a burglar.

21:35.740 --> 21:38.138
Perhaps he wasn't very good at it.

21:38.140 --> 21:41.779
Maybe Lewis went into the studio
looking for help.

21:41.819 --> 21:44.940
He didn't reply because he couldn't.

21:44.980 --> 21:46.859
What do you mean, "couldn't"?

21:46.900 --> 21:48.659
Perhaps he was already dying.

21:48.660 --> 21:50.739
We know what killed him, Padre!

21:50.740 --> 21:53.019
It was made of willow.
Are you certain?

21:54.220 --> 21:57.380
There's only one way to settle this,
isn't there?

22:01.700 --> 22:04.140
Is that Dr Symonds?

22:04.180 --> 22:06.179
Inspector Mallory,
Kembleford Police.

22:06.180 --> 22:09.500
Do we have a confirmed cause of
death on Lewis Ward yet?

22:16.259 --> 22:17.259
I see.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.859
Thank you.

22:24.779 --> 22:28.900
Signs of respiratory failure,
lockjaw, frothing at the mouth.

22:28.940 --> 22:32.419
Strychnine. Yes, thank you, I know
what the symptoms are!

22:32.420 --> 22:35.819
Why would somebody have
wanted him dead? He was a nobody.

22:35.859 --> 22:38.460
I should tell you that Lewis Ward...

22:39.700 --> 22:41.900
..was in possession
of photographic negatives

22:41.940 --> 22:43.220
of an...

22:45.180 --> 22:47.819
..explicit nature.
It's the first I've heard of it!

22:49.660 --> 22:52.499
Where are these negatives now?

22:52.500 --> 22:53.660
I destroyed them.

22:55.339 --> 22:56.818
You did what?!

22:56.819 --> 22:59.779
Like you, at first, I believed his
death to be an accident

22:59.819 --> 23:02.380
and I saw no gain in
publicising activities

23:02.420 --> 23:05.419
that would only
soil his reputation.

23:05.420 --> 23:08.299
We shall continue this discussion.

23:08.339 --> 23:11.659
For now, my priority is
catching his murderer.

23:11.660 --> 23:14.459
And if he was distributing
the photographs,

23:14.460 --> 23:17.259
I very much doubt
he was doing it alone.

23:17.259 --> 23:20.099
Have you any idea who his
accomplice might be?

23:20.140 --> 23:22.138
If someone was selling dirt
in Kembleford,

23:22.140 --> 23:25.138
there's only one name that
springs to mind.

23:25.140 --> 23:27.299
Just hope he isn't
blind drunk already.

23:38.220 --> 23:40.819
So, which one of you discerning
gentlemen will be going home

23:40.859 --> 23:43.859
with this high-quality timepiece?

23:43.900 --> 23:46.298
Stolen, is it, 'Arry?

23:46.299 --> 23:50.140
Of course not, Inspector.
I wouldn't deal in stolen goods.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.858
What do you think, Sergeant?

23:51.859 --> 23:55.378
This particular item once belonged
to my very own uncle.

23:55.380 --> 23:58.378
So you'll be able to tell
me his initials then?

23:58.380 --> 24:00.900
Who in turn was given it by
an old army friend.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.339
Can't recall his name.

24:02.380 --> 24:05.980
Luckily for you, I'm not interested
in dodgy watches today.

24:06.019 --> 24:07.819
Then how can I help you, Inspector?

24:07.859 --> 24:10.059
Looking for a present
for Mrs Mallory?

24:11.460 --> 24:14.140
I want to talk to you
about photographs.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.779
Not really my area of expertise.

24:18.819 --> 24:22.338
Now... if you don't mind, I was just
having a drink with my friends.

24:22.339 --> 24:25.299
Why don't we discuss this down
the station, 'Arry?

24:25.339 --> 24:28.019
I'm sure you'd love to assist us
in our enquiries.

24:30.019 --> 24:31.339
Excuse me.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.700
I'm here to see Harold Slow. Who?

24:44.740 --> 24:46.618
Harold...

24:46.619 --> 24:48.818
Blind 'Arry.
Oh! Why didn't you say so?

24:48.819 --> 24:50.500
Just, give me a minute, Father.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.740
Padre. I had a feeling
you'd be back.

24:54.980 --> 24:58.220
Blind 'Arry is not
capable of murder.

24:58.259 --> 25:00.819
Yet we searched his
malodorous residence

25:00.859 --> 25:03.460
and found two photographs
featuring young ladies.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.500
These young ladies
were both noticeable

25:05.539 --> 25:08.539
for their complete
lack of clothing.

25:08.579 --> 25:11.818
So what did he say?
Claimed he'd never seen them before.

25:11.819 --> 25:14.420
Of course, he also said that about
the three Kilner jars

25:14.460 --> 25:18.138
of moonshine, the half-dozen ladies'
purses and the garden gnome

25:18.140 --> 25:21.259
that went missing from Councillor
Boothby's front porch last week.

25:21.299 --> 25:24.579
If you're here to take his
confession, you might be a while.

25:29.900 --> 25:31.619
FATHER BROWN SIGHS

25:31.660 --> 25:34.739
Father! Decent of you to pop by.

25:34.740 --> 25:39.659
The inspector told me about the
photographs they found in your barn.

25:39.660 --> 25:42.578
Look, Father, you know full well I
had nothing to do

25:42.579 --> 25:44.459
with that young lad's death.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.900
As for the photographs...

25:47.099 --> 25:50.618
..well, not everybody has taken
a vow of celibacy.

25:50.619 --> 25:53.099
But they was purely
for my personal pleasure.

25:54.819 --> 25:57.299
Did Lewis Ward sell them to you?

25:57.339 --> 26:00.059
Nah. Never even met the lad.

26:00.099 --> 26:02.618
Only knew his face from seeing him
around town

26:02.619 --> 26:04.619
pointing his camera at everything.

26:05.819 --> 26:08.298
Last time I saw him was
a couple of days ago.

26:08.299 --> 26:11.138
He was having
a barney with that tweedy girl

26:11.140 --> 26:13.179
from the library.

26:13.180 --> 26:16.659
Sounded like she was
breaking up with him. Go on.

26:16.660 --> 26:20.979
Well, he's saying, "I'll do whatever
you want, you can trust me."

26:20.980 --> 26:23.179
And she's not that sure.

26:23.180 --> 26:25.898
So he's like, "Of course I still
want to be with you",

26:25.900 --> 26:29.380
and she says, "Well, I don't know.
Everything's changed."

26:29.420 --> 26:32.859
And he's like, "What, because of
a few stupid photographs?"

26:32.900 --> 26:35.339
And so she says, "Sorry."

26:35.380 --> 26:38.140
And he's, "Oh, please,
Ada, I love you!"

26:38.180 --> 26:39.980
And he's left there, devastated.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.220
Did you hear anything else?

26:45.259 --> 26:46.579
That's all.

26:46.619 --> 26:49.220
Sorry, Father,
you know I'd help you if I could.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.180
Answer me this.

26:54.980 --> 26:58.859
If a Kembleford gentleman wished to
purchase photographs

26:58.900 --> 27:01.700
of a... titillating nature...

27:02.980 --> 27:05.140
..where would he go?

27:05.180 --> 27:08.618
And here's me thinking you're
a respectable man of the cloth!

27:08.619 --> 27:10.420
HE LAUGHS

27:15.740 --> 27:17.740
Do you want to stay in here
all night?

27:21.220 --> 27:25.259
Help me discover the truth and you
might make last orders.

27:27.420 --> 27:29.339
All right, I'll tell you.

27:30.779 --> 27:33.538
On one condition.

27:33.539 --> 27:35.220
Absolutely not!

27:35.259 --> 27:38.660
There is no way I am stepping out
with that foul-mouthed vagrant!

27:38.700 --> 27:41.099
Perhaps he has hidden qualities.

27:41.140 --> 27:43.940
Then they are very
well-hidden indeed.

27:43.980 --> 27:46.618
It would only be
a stroll along the river.

27:46.619 --> 27:50.259
And he's promised to be
the model gentleman.

27:50.259 --> 27:55.099
He can behave like Saint Francis of
Assisi - it is not going to happen!

27:55.140 --> 27:57.539
I may have already accepted
on your behalf.

27:59.059 --> 28:01.220
Well, then you can unaccept!

28:01.259 --> 28:04.818
I can't, he's already
given me the information.

28:04.819 --> 28:06.700
Please, Mrs McCarthy...

28:08.740 --> 28:11.460
..consider this an act of charity.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.900
Well, I hope that information
was worth it,

28:13.940 --> 28:17.460
because you are never, ever
going to hear the end of this.

28:22.700 --> 28:23.980
So?

28:27.779 --> 28:29.859
Blind 'Arry said he got
the photographs

28:29.900 --> 28:31.700
by going to the mobile library...

28:33.380 --> 28:35.979
..putting half a crown
in the fines box,

28:35.980 --> 28:37.339
and asking for a book.

28:39.420 --> 28:42.059
About...
BOTH: Butterflies.

28:42.099 --> 28:44.298
I'm guessing it would be
under natural history.

28:44.299 --> 28:48.219
Or it could be here
in the returns trolley.

28:48.220 --> 28:51.618
Ah. There it is.

28:51.619 --> 28:53.819
Oh. "The Lepidopterist's Companion."

28:57.339 --> 29:01.818
Yes. And that's what it is -
a book about butterflies.

29:01.819 --> 29:03.339
SHE CHUCKLES

29:07.420 --> 29:10.819
It's been taken out dozens of times
in the past few months.

29:12.140 --> 29:15.420
Either there's a glut of
lepidopterists in Kembleford

29:15.460 --> 29:17.980
or there is something
strange going on.

29:18.019 --> 29:20.819
Look, it's always returned
within a day or so,

29:20.859 --> 29:23.098
sometimes even on the same day.

29:23.099 --> 29:26.339
Do you think someone was hiding
the photographs inside it?

29:50.140 --> 29:53.539
Was Lewis pressurising you into
selling the pictures?

29:53.579 --> 29:56.180
I don't know what you're
talking about.

29:56.220 --> 29:57.579
Butterflies.

29:59.259 --> 30:00.460
You've lost me.

30:00.500 --> 30:04.380
I know that the photographs were
distributed via the mobile library.

30:05.700 --> 30:08.660
Perfect, really. It can travel
without suspicion.

30:10.059 --> 30:11.779
Quiet, discreet.

30:13.700 --> 30:17.858
And if men come and go with
large books... what of it?

30:17.859 --> 30:20.779
Father, please, I'm tired,
I want to go home.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.299
If Lewis was making you...

30:22.339 --> 30:24.019
He's dead!

30:24.059 --> 30:27.380
So why can't you stop sticking
your nose where it isn't wanted?

30:32.819 --> 30:34.380
You mean...

30:35.700 --> 30:41.298
..he had naked girls in my studio?
It would seem so.

30:41.299 --> 30:43.500
Never knew he had it in him!

30:43.539 --> 30:46.779
So... where are these
negatives now then?

30:46.819 --> 30:48.299
Erm, they're destroyed.

30:48.339 --> 30:51.019
Did you ever notice anything
suspicious going on

30:51.059 --> 30:52.699
in the mobile library?

30:52.700 --> 30:57.619
Well... Ada was the one who
served the customers.

30:57.660 --> 31:00.980
I was busy with the
administrative side of things.

31:01.019 --> 31:04.859
But if what you're saying is true,
we have to inform the police.

31:04.900 --> 31:07.660
Hold on! If these negatives
have been destroyed,

31:07.700 --> 31:11.419
perhaps we're better off sweeping
the whole thing under the carpet.

31:11.420 --> 31:14.898
But, Graham, if Lewis was poisoned,

31:14.900 --> 31:18.019
maybe an angry boyfriend or father
could've found out

31:18.059 --> 31:21.298
they'd taken pictures of his girl
and wanted revenge!

31:21.299 --> 31:22.699
The same thing had occurred to me.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.859
Anyone home?

31:25.900 --> 31:28.339
Sorry to barge in. Door was open.

31:28.380 --> 31:31.619
Constable, make sure the padre
stays up here, out of the way.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.299
Do you mind telling
me what is going on?

31:35.339 --> 31:38.818
Got a warrant. A warrant?

31:38.819 --> 31:42.259
We had an anonymous tip-off from
a woman saying you offered

31:42.259 --> 31:45.660
her money to pose for you
in her birthday suit.

31:45.700 --> 31:48.618
We're here to search the property
for evidence of activities

31:48.619 --> 31:53.380
in contravention of the Town Police
Clauses Act 1847, Section 28.

31:55.099 --> 31:56.619
Oh, yes...

31:58.059 --> 31:59.059
..and of murder.

32:07.940 --> 32:10.660
Do a lot of your customers have
their portrait taken

32:10.700 --> 32:12.779
in this sort of thing?

32:12.819 --> 32:15.538
No! Where did you even find that?

32:15.539 --> 32:19.419
Stashed in a little cubby hole
in your storeroom.

32:19.420 --> 32:21.619
And the photographs
in our possession,

32:21.660 --> 32:24.699
which I perused purely for
investigative purposes,

32:24.700 --> 32:28.019
were taken in front of your
distinctive backdrop.

32:28.059 --> 32:30.779
Lewis must have taken them, I...
Yes, I'm glad you mentioned him.

32:30.819 --> 32:32.338
Because I got to thinking -

32:32.339 --> 32:36.259
what if this Lewis lad was just
the assistant after all?

32:36.299 --> 32:40.099
Perhaps he was angling for
a bigger cut, threatening to go to

32:40.140 --> 32:42.940
the authorities, so you thought it
best to poison him.

32:42.980 --> 32:44.819
After that,
you hit him round the head

32:44.859 --> 32:49.459
with a cricket bat to make it look
like you'd disturbed a burglar!

32:49.460 --> 32:51.180
No, that's not what happened.

32:51.220 --> 32:53.339
Found this in
a box on the counter, sir.

32:55.779 --> 32:57.779
Excellent. I won that on the horses.

32:57.819 --> 32:59.819
I only hid it
so the missus wouldn't find out.

32:59.859 --> 33:02.460
How convenient.

33:02.500 --> 33:07.059
You see, we did some digging into
Lewis' financial situation.

33:07.099 --> 33:10.180
Turns out that for the master of his
own empire of obscenity,

33:10.220 --> 33:13.019
he was surprisingly skint.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.618
You, however...

33:15.619 --> 33:18.259
look like you're doing
all right for yourself.

33:24.019 --> 33:26.420
I take it Blind 'Arry's
been released?

33:26.460 --> 33:28.859
Pending further enquiries.

33:28.900 --> 33:31.579
Here you go, Father.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.059
Thank you, Sergeant.

33:38.660 --> 33:40.259
CELL DOOR SLAMS

33:40.299 --> 33:42.898
Wasn't sure if you'd come.

33:42.900 --> 33:45.619
It's been so long since I showed
my face in church.

33:47.220 --> 33:50.380
Many return to religion
in times of crisis.

33:50.420 --> 33:54.619
I'll be honest, Father,
it's your help I need, not God's.

33:54.660 --> 33:55.859
Go on.

33:55.900 --> 34:00.140
Would you go and see Margaret and
make sure she knows I didn't do it?

34:00.180 --> 34:03.180
I've been enough of a disappointment
to her over the years.

34:03.220 --> 34:06.578
I doubt that's true.
Of course it is!

34:06.579 --> 34:09.260
Never lived up to my
early potential, did I?

34:09.300 --> 34:11.898
She thought I was going to be this
successful photographer,

34:11.900 --> 34:14.539
but things didn't quite work out.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.739
Still, I can't bear her thinking
I'm capable of murder.

34:22.099 --> 34:25.099
Do you know anything
about the photographs?

34:25.139 --> 34:26.579
That weren't me either.

34:26.579 --> 34:30.619
Lewis must've taken them,
but that Inspector won't believe me!

34:30.659 --> 34:32.619
How am I going to cope in prison?

34:34.099 --> 34:37.099
I can't even get to sleep without
a mug of Margaret's cocoa inside me!

34:40.579 --> 34:44.659
Please. Please, Father...

34:44.659 --> 34:46.659
Yes. Yes, I'll speak to her.

34:48.139 --> 34:49.900
Thank you.

35:09.659 --> 35:14.099
How many more of these horrid
pictures do I have to look at?

35:14.099 --> 35:16.539
We need to prove who
took these photographs.

35:18.739 --> 35:21.500
Each of those girls is
a potential witness.

35:21.539 --> 35:24.659
And you DID say you're
very good with faces.

35:24.659 --> 35:28.179
Yes, well, it's not the faces
that bother me.

35:28.179 --> 35:30.858
And in any case,
it's almost impossible

35:30.860 --> 35:33.659
to recognise someone
when they look so...

35:33.699 --> 35:35.619
Well, topsy-turvy.

35:37.420 --> 35:39.898
Well, why don't we
just develop a few more?

35:39.900 --> 35:41.460
Oh. Wait.

35:47.420 --> 35:49.659
That's one face
I definitely recognise.

36:01.219 --> 36:02.780
As I feared.

36:07.739 --> 36:09.900
I know you posed for
the photographs.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.099
I'm not judging you.

36:16.099 --> 36:19.780
You must have needed that
money very badly.

36:19.820 --> 36:21.659
I was in a lot of debt.

36:21.659 --> 36:24.260
My landlady was threatening
to throw me out.

36:24.300 --> 36:27.019
I don't think you would
have said yes that easily.

36:28.460 --> 36:30.260
There must have been persuasion.

36:32.260 --> 36:34.900
How did Mrs Cartwright
talk you into it?

36:37.219 --> 36:39.619
She caught me stealing
from the fines box.

36:39.619 --> 36:42.059
She said if I didn't help her
sell the photographs,

36:42.099 --> 36:44.699
she'd report me to the police.

36:44.739 --> 36:48.418
So you started selling
the photographs.

36:48.420 --> 36:51.619
And then, when you were involved,

36:51.619 --> 36:54.659
she persuaded you
to take the next step.

36:54.659 --> 36:57.300
The night it happened,
I tried to back out.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.539
But it was just so much money and...

37:00.539 --> 37:02.940
she has this way about her.

37:02.980 --> 37:05.018
Like you don't have a choice.

37:05.019 --> 37:06.699
I don't really drink.

37:06.739 --> 37:08.219
It'll help you relax.

37:10.820 --> 37:13.539
I've never done
anything like this before.

37:13.539 --> 37:15.980
The thought of all those men
leering at me...

37:16.019 --> 37:19.019
Makes you feel vulnerable.
I understand.

37:21.059 --> 37:24.260
But you're the one who has got
the power over them.

37:24.300 --> 37:27.539
They'll pay handsomely for just
a glimpse of your beauty.

37:28.659 --> 37:30.380
Do you know, it's
not even really you.

37:30.420 --> 37:32.019
Just a shadow on a bit of paper.

37:33.860 --> 37:38.860
So why go hungry when you have the
power to put food on your plate?

37:48.300 --> 37:49.300
Lovely.

37:51.619 --> 37:53.539
Make the most of it.

37:53.579 --> 37:54.940
Sorry, Mr Cartwright...

37:54.980 --> 37:57.659
Get out! Get out, you idiot!

37:57.699 --> 37:58.780
Sorry, I didn't...

38:00.780 --> 38:03.500
Lewis and I had not long started
seeing each other.

38:05.340 --> 38:08.179
After that, I couldn't look
him in the eye.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.260
I knew I'd made a mistake.

38:10.300 --> 38:13.820
Mrs Cartwright said that she'd make
sure the photos were

38:13.860 --> 38:17.699
seen by everyone in Kembleford
if I didn't keep my mouth shut.

38:17.739 --> 38:20.860
So, her injuries weren't accidental?

38:22.019 --> 38:23.500
I...

38:23.539 --> 38:26.219
Mr Entwhistle says he
didn't get a delivery

38:26.260 --> 38:29.900
of Graham Greene's
new novel from you that morning.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.699
I didn't mean to hurt
Mrs Cartwright.

38:31.739 --> 38:34.659
I-I tried again to persuade her
not to show the photos of me,

38:34.699 --> 38:38.739
and she flew off the handle.
I'd never seen her like that.

38:38.780 --> 38:41.019
You just quit your mewling!

38:41.059 --> 38:44.980
Those photographs, they belong to
me now, and if I want to sell them,

38:45.019 --> 38:48.818
then I will. So you just shut up
and do as you're told!

38:48.820 --> 38:50.699
ADA SHRIEKS

38:50.739 --> 38:52.619
BOOKCASE CREAKS

38:56.139 --> 38:57.380
Mrs Cartwright?

39:02.139 --> 39:04.219
I thought she was dead.

39:04.260 --> 39:07.659
I didn't know what to do,
so I went to see Lewis.

39:07.699 --> 39:10.219
He offered to find the negatives
and hide them until

39:10.260 --> 39:13.338
we'd decided whether or not to
destroy them or go to the police.

39:13.340 --> 39:17.019
So Lewis wasn't involved
in taking the photographs?

39:17.059 --> 39:21.260
No. And as far as I know,
Mr Cartwright didn't either.

39:21.300 --> 39:24.139
Please don't tell anyone.
It'll be my word against hers.

39:24.179 --> 39:25.179
My thoughts exactly.

39:29.099 --> 39:32.619
Mrs Cartwright.
What are you doing out of bed?

39:33.900 --> 39:35.539
Tying up loose ends.

39:35.539 --> 39:37.498
SHE LAUGHS SOFTLY

39:37.500 --> 39:40.340
Well, you said yourself,
the negatives have been destroyed.

39:43.059 --> 39:45.099
I may have exaggerated.

39:45.099 --> 39:46.579
LAUGHING: Nice try.

39:47.900 --> 39:50.739
Without Ada, there's
no evidence to prosecute me.

39:50.780 --> 39:52.498
I don't think my customers are
going to be

39:52.500 --> 39:54.179
lining up to testify in court.

39:55.860 --> 40:00.699
My husband will go to jail, and I'll
sell the studio and move on.

40:00.739 --> 40:03.619
It was you who
tipped off the police.

40:05.860 --> 40:08.420
A chance to get rid of the
husband you despise.

40:08.460 --> 40:12.778
I have wasted my youth on that
pathetic lump of a man!

40:12.780 --> 40:15.019
So he might as well be useful
for something!

40:17.579 --> 40:21.500
Anyway... anyone fancy
a drive in the country?

40:26.739 --> 40:29.539
Mrs Cartwright! Let us out!

40:29.579 --> 40:31.179
ENGINE STARTS
Margaret!

40:36.420 --> 40:40.338
Where's she taking us?
You've seen too much!

40:40.340 --> 40:46.579
So I'm going to take you on a little
trip out to Buckley's Point,

40:46.619 --> 40:51.860
where sadly, this van's brakes are
going to mysteriously fail.

40:53.139 --> 40:56.139
Is that why you put
strychnine in Lewis' cocoa?

40:56.179 --> 40:57.980
Because he'd seen too much?

40:58.019 --> 41:00.539
Oh, I'm impressed, Father.

41:00.539 --> 41:02.619
I couldn't trust him to
keep it secret.

41:04.500 --> 41:08.139
He was so obviously doolally about
Miss Rawlins back there.

41:10.860 --> 41:13.420
Mrs Cartwright!
Thought you'd be in bed.

41:15.179 --> 41:21.818
Well, I couldn't sleep, and
I heard you working away down here.

41:21.820 --> 41:23.980
So I thought you'd like some cocoa.

41:24.019 --> 41:26.019
That's very good of you.

41:29.500 --> 41:32.699
About what I saw the other night.
You and Ada.

41:32.739 --> 41:35.219
You know I won't
tell anyone, right?

41:35.219 --> 41:36.460
Not even Mr Cartwright.

41:37.699 --> 41:39.619
I know you won't, dear.

41:43.739 --> 41:46.619
I was going to make it look
like suicide.

41:46.659 --> 41:50.460
Victim of a broken heart.

41:50.500 --> 41:53.259
But then that idiot husband of mine

41:53.260 --> 41:56.300
started to play
the protective house owner.

42:01.380 --> 42:02.579
What are you doing?

42:03.820 --> 42:06.019
Are you all right back there?

42:06.059 --> 42:09.338
When a butterfly needs to break
out of its chrysalis,

42:09.340 --> 42:11.300
it needs to find the weakest point.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.780
I'm not boring you, am I?

42:27.579 --> 42:29.579
Oh, no, you don't!

42:37.139 --> 42:40.739
Perhaps... we should
get off the road.

42:40.780 --> 42:42.539
CLICKING AND RATTLING

42:42.539 --> 42:44.780
No! No! Come on!

42:47.500 --> 42:49.539
SHE SPLUTTERS

42:59.900 --> 43:02.300
Ah. Big end's gone.

43:05.139 --> 43:07.659
By the time we got there,
she'd already fled the scene,

43:07.699 --> 43:10.219
but it didn't take us
long to pick her up.

43:10.219 --> 43:12.898
Turns out that, like the van,

43:12.900 --> 43:15.300
she's not in as good
a condition as she once was.

43:15.340 --> 43:16.739
Inspector.

43:21.340 --> 43:23.619
I thought you might
need them as evidence.

43:25.820 --> 43:28.900
You said you destroyed them!

43:28.940 --> 43:30.300
Some of them.

43:36.019 --> 43:40.260
So, are you going to take over the
mobile library on a permanent basis?

43:40.300 --> 43:42.500
Oh, dear me, no.

43:42.539 --> 43:46.539
I never realised how stressful being
a librarian could be.

43:46.579 --> 43:50.298
And in any case, we have
a far more suitable candidate.

43:50.300 --> 43:52.019
Me?

43:52.059 --> 43:53.458
After what happened, I thought...

43:53.460 --> 43:56.099
Well, you do know it better
than anyone.

43:56.139 --> 44:00.619
And Mrs M won't have as much time on
her hands now that she's courting.

44:00.619 --> 44:01.619
I beg your pardon?

44:13.699 --> 44:17.179
Half a crown says he stole those
flowers from the graveyard.

44:17.219 --> 44:18.739
Harold.

44:18.780 --> 44:20.579
How delightful to see you again.

44:27.820 --> 44:29.659
THEY CHUCKLE
