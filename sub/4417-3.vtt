00:02.001 --> 00:03.920
MOLLY:
<i>My name is Molly Woods.</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:05.880
<i>I'm an astronaut.</i>

00:05.964 --> 00:07.882
<i>My husband John,</i>
<i>a robotics engineer,</i>

00:07.966 --> 00:11.594
<i>created a lifelike robot</i>
<i>called a Humanich.</i>

00:11.678 --> 00:14.431
<i>We adopted the prototype</i>
<i>as our son.</i>

00:14.514 --> 00:17.434
<i>His name is Ethan.</i>

00:17.517 --> 00:20.270
<i>Everything changed when I went</i>
<i>to space on a 13-month</i>

00:20.353 --> 00:21.813
<i>solo mission.</i>

00:21.896 --> 00:23.606
<i>I didn't come home alone.</i>

00:23.690 --> 00:24.816
MOLLY:
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

00:24.899 --> 00:26.234
{\an3}How is that
even possible?

00:26.317 --> 00:27.819
<i>The child-- part human,</i>

00:27.902 --> 00:29.612
<i>part alien--</i>
<i>was unlike anything</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:31.114
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

00:31.197 --> 00:33.158
How'd you get so big so fast?

00:33.241 --> 00:35.452
<i>And he was dangerous.</i>

00:35.535 --> 00:37.245
<i>Eventually...</i>
Run!

00:37.328 --> 00:39.122
<i>...I lost both of my sons...</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:40.081
Ethan!

00:40.165 --> 00:41.124
Mom!

00:41.207 --> 00:43.168
<i>...and my husband.</i>

00:43.251 --> 00:45.587
<i>Some people say</i>
<i>I've gone crazy.</i>

00:45.670 --> 00:47.464
This is a cover-up!
That's what this is!

00:47.547 --> 00:49.466
{\an3}Get your hands
off of me!

00:49.549 --> 00:51.760
<i>I say there's more</i>
<i>to the story.</i>

00:51.843 --> 00:53.845
<i>It's up to me</i>
<i>to find the truth,</i>

00:53.928 --> 00:56.848
<i>before it's too late.</i>

00:58.057 --> 00:59.809
<i>Previously on</i> Extant...

00:59.893 --> 01:01.644
{\an1}This isn't
a murder investigation.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.646
{\an4}It's an invasion.
SHEPHERD:
<i>We thought he was dead,</i>

01:03.730 --> 01:05.105
but we were wrong.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.816
We've used
an accelerated aging program

01:06.900 --> 01:10.195
to create an image
of what he looks like now.

01:10.278 --> 01:13.281
{\an5}MOLLY:
<i>I think I'm going crazy.</i>
<i>I'm blacking out,</i>

01:13.364 --> 01:16.117
and I'm ending up in places that
I have no idea how I got there.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.161
{\an1}Get dressed!
You're not my mom!

01:18.244 --> 01:21.456
{\an5}ANNA:
<i>If you cannot get him</i>
<i>under control,</i>

01:21.539 --> 01:23.041
we will give him
to someone who can.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.168
JULIE:
<i>Okay, I can reprogram him.</i>

01:27.295 --> 01:29.297
Good night, Rabbit.
Good night, Mom.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.466
{\an5}ANNA:
<i>We would like this new breed</i>
<i>of Humanichs</i>

01:31.549 --> 01:33.301
<i>to be stronger than we are.</i>

01:33.384 --> 01:36.304
{\an3}(shouting)
Let go!

01:36.387 --> 01:38.681
{\an1}Taylor recommended
a drone strike.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.891
Give me eyes on the target.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.684
VELEZ:
There's Molly Woods.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.685
Stop.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.188
Sir, what do we do?

01:45.271 --> 01:46.898
Launch.

01:53.613 --> 01:57.700
(rock music playing)

01:57.784 --> 01:59.744
{\an3}Some things are better left
alone! That's all I'm saying.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.247
Analog audio technology
was developed at a time

02:02.330 --> 02:04.290
{\an3}when people cared
about warmth and depth.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.501
It came of age when music
defined people's lives

02:06.584 --> 02:08.169
and foreshadowed
the alienation of modern man.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.588
Something must be pretty special
here.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.965
They're sending
in the government spooks

02:12.048 --> 02:13.341
to pick him up in the morning.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.009
I got something more mellow
right here.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.427
This is a classic.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.762
You like sad songs?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.347
{\an1}I work in a morgue,
don't I?

02:19.430 --> 02:21.266
Here, take that off.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.105
(sloshing sounds)

02:41.119 --> 02:44.122
(cracking)

02:44.205 --> 02:46.374
{\an3}(sloshing)

02:46.457 --> 02:47.876
{\an3}(thuds)

02:47.959 --> 02:50.295
{\an3}Oh, dude.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.403
(crying)

03:31.002 --> 03:33.421
(indistinct chatter)

03:42.931 --> 03:44.724
Just put your eye up here
for the key scan

03:44.807 --> 03:47.226
and it's all yours, Mrs. Nelson.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.710
This matter is, uh,
well, uh, delicate.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.629
Ha! Isn't it always?

04:14.712 --> 04:17.632
Oh, I should've known
you'd laugh at me.

04:17.714 --> 04:21.219
(crying)
(slapping sound)

04:21.302 --> 04:22.804
Pull yourself together.
I can't stand...

04:22.887 --> 04:26.015
MAN: AG5, an asteroid
140 meters wide...

04:26.099 --> 04:28.559
(overlapping voices)

04:33.064 --> 04:35.483
(overlapping voices continue)

04:55.962 --> 04:58.423
(overlapping voices continue)

05:08.599 --> 05:11.686
MAN: ...American West, a lone
coyote hunts for prey.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.022
(gunfire)

05:14.105 --> 05:16.566
(overlapping voices, gunfire)

05:25.324 --> 05:27.785
(dance music playing)

05:36.669 --> 05:38.963
{\an3}Is this
seat taken?

05:40.631 --> 05:43.634
It is now.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.978
MAN:
<i>Drone on final approach.</i>

05:54.062 --> 05:55.480
Icarian-4, inbound

05:55.563 --> 05:56.689
90 seconds.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.531
(loud clinking)

06:08.534 --> 06:10.745
You haven't told me your name.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.497
Ahdu.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.541
That's beautiful.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.920
I'm Molly.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.963
It's good to see you, Molly.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.758
Have we met before?

06:23.841 --> 06:26.135
It's a small universe.

06:28.554 --> 06:32.058
♪ Ah... ♪

06:33.392 --> 06:35.186
We've lost visual, sir.

06:35.269 --> 06:37.396
SHEPHERD: I need eyes.
Get me that picture back.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.648
Working on it, sir.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.901
Seems to be some
sort of interference.

06:43.653 --> 06:48.282
Maybe we should go somewhere
a little more quiet?

06:48.366 --> 06:51.369
Lead the way.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.795
{\an1}(talking indistinctly,
laughing)

07:02.046 --> 07:04.048
{\an3}Come here.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.642
Just when I thought we had
something special going on.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.144
Hey, Molly.

07:16.227 --> 07:20.857
You move,
I shoot your kneecap off.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.901
{\an1}You think I was gonna let you
get away from me twice?

07:23.985 --> 07:26.028
{\an1}Now, the way
I got it figured,

07:26.112 --> 07:28.656
{\an1}you either really needed
to get laid

07:28.739 --> 07:30.032
{\an1}or you know
who the killer is.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.242
{\an1}Hell, maybe
you're even in on it.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.243
Put the gun down.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.287
I don't think so.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.257
Oh, my God.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.342
{\an1}It's you.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.053
{\an3}But...

07:51.137 --> 07:52.930
{\an1}how could this
be possible?

07:53.931 --> 07:55.349
Oh, no, no, no! Don't...

07:55.433 --> 07:56.517
don't hurt him!

07:56.601 --> 07:57.518
Stop it!

07:57.602 --> 07:59.437
{\an3}Stop it!

08:01.189 --> 08:03.441
Right now.

08:05.109 --> 08:08.196
{\an1}(panting)

08:08.279 --> 08:10.406
What is that sound?

08:10.489 --> 08:11.991
(drone approaching)
Down!

08:14.243 --> 08:15.912
(explosion)

08:23.169 --> 08:25.046
(woman screaming in distance)

08:25.129 --> 08:28.132
(coughing)

08:28.216 --> 08:29.800
Are you okay?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.427
Where is he?

08:31.510 --> 08:32.803
{\an1}(grunting)

08:32.886 --> 08:35.264
{\an1}Who is he?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.265
(panting)

08:37.350 --> 08:39.227
My son.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.437
{\an1}MAN:
Don't move!

08:41.520 --> 08:43.606
{\an1}Put your hands
in the air!

08:43.688 --> 08:45.191
{\an1}Right now.

08:45.274 --> 08:46.776
Clear the area.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.486
Sir, we have Dr. Woods.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.279
You've got an artifact
in her scanning process

08:50.363 --> 08:52.031
{\an1}that's generating noise.
Just a simple question

08:52.114 --> 08:54.825
{\an1}of turning down
the volume. Cool?

08:54.909 --> 08:56.452
Problems?

08:56.535 --> 08:58.663
Problems are just possibilities.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.123
{\an3}ETHAN:
Hey, Mom,

09:01.207 --> 09:02.416
can you come help me with this?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.877
{\an1}I'll be
right there, Rabbit.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.425
The ethical adapter's installed.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.470
You got a second adapter you can
install on yourself, Mom?

09:14.553 --> 09:17.098
That's not fair, Charlie.

09:17.181 --> 09:20.643
You think I wanted
to wipe his memories of Molly?

09:20.726 --> 09:22.603
He was in a
lot of pain.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.940
I did what I had to do.
So lay off, please.

09:26.023 --> 09:29.151
Let's get this show started,
shall we?

09:29.235 --> 09:31.821
{\an5}VELEZ:
<i>Let's try this again,</i>
<i>Mr. Richter.</i>

09:31.904 --> 09:34.657
You took Molly Woods
from RestWell Recovery Center

09:34.740 --> 09:38.077
{\an1}with a fake court order.
So...

09:38.160 --> 09:41.163
what do you know about the man
Molly Woods was with in the bar?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.207
The first I've ever seen of him.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.667
What were you doing with her?

09:44.750 --> 09:47.545
I'm just a cop working
a homicide.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.133
You were in Second K.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.010
Good for you.
You can read.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.845
Didn't do too well there.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.222
Mm. I have a problem
with authority.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.099
Apparently.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.061
Dishonorable discharge
two months in.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.856
I also have a problem
with innocent people dying

10:06.939 --> 10:08.858
in pointless wars.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.651
{\an1}This spray induces
the feeling

10:10.735 --> 10:13.988
{\an1}of three days'
sleep-deprivation. So...

10:14.071 --> 10:17.366
what is your association
with Molly Woods?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.160
I'm just a cop on a case.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.370
What were you doing
outside that bar?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.039
Cop on a case.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.374
What was Molly Woods
doing there?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.835
You're gonna bruise.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.378
Bones in the hand,

10:29.462 --> 10:30.963
there's no cushion.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.091
{\an1}You're holding back
information

10:34.175 --> 10:36.886
that could save innocent lives.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.055
{\an1}Now, what did
Molly Woods tell you

10:39.138 --> 10:41.349
about the man
in that bar?

10:41.432 --> 10:43.809
Bone bruises are the worst.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.191
{\an1}Oh, that sucks.
Now...

10:50.274 --> 10:53.319
you think you can help me out?

10:53.402 --> 10:56.405
Yeah.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.407
I totally would,

10:58.491 --> 11:01.327
except for now
I'm too tired to talk.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.915
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Richter.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.458
{\an1}You won't
be smiling for long.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.585
(lock beeps)

11:11.545 --> 11:13.589
MAN:
<i>Who is JD Richter to you?</i>

11:17.843 --> 11:20.471
Okay. You were
in that bar-- why?

11:20.554 --> 11:23.891
Was it a prearranged meeting?

11:25.518 --> 11:28.437
The fruit.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.940
That's how it starts.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.817
(inhales deeply)

11:32.900 --> 11:36.112
{\an1}Are you trying
to remind me of spring?

11:36.195 --> 11:39.615
Better days, blue skies.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.617
Skies you took away?

11:41.700 --> 11:43.786
{\an1}'Cause in space,
we didn't have fruit.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.997
We only had these little blue,
green and yellow pills.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.792
They tasted like fruit.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.711
But they weren't fruit.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.299
{\an1}Mmm.
Dr. Woods,

11:57.383 --> 12:01.303
this can go on another few
hours, or you can cooperate.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.639
I will cooperate.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.808
{\an1}As soon as those cowards
come out from behind

12:05.891 --> 12:07.935
{\an1}that glass
and answer my questions.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.480
Like...

12:11.564 --> 12:13.107
how come they decided
to blow up

12:13.190 --> 12:15.192
{\an1}a bar full
of innocent people?

12:18.737 --> 12:20.823
Do you even have the balls
to come from behind there

12:20.906 --> 12:23.159
and tell me to my face?

12:23.242 --> 12:25.244
Whoever you are?

12:33.252 --> 12:35.963
{\an3}Toby... what good
can come from

12:36.046 --> 12:38.466
{\an3}going in there?
More than you think.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.802
(lock beeps)

12:49.602 --> 12:51.145
Toby.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.813
Hello, Molly.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.483
You son of a bitch!

12:55.566 --> 12:58.027
How could you
do this...

13:00.112 --> 13:03.699
Stand down.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.034
A.I.-- privacy mode.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.329
A.I. VOICE:
Privacy Mode engaged.

13:08.412 --> 13:11.624
I'd like a word
with Dr. Woods. Alone.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.587
(lock beeps)

13:17.630 --> 13:19.673
(door closes, locks)

13:24.428 --> 13:28.265
If I were you, I wouldn't
be alone with me right now.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.352
CHARLIE:
<i>Here we go.</i>

13:31.435 --> 13:32.895
Four,

13:32.978 --> 13:35.022
{\an3}three, two,

13:35.105 --> 13:36.524
one.
(soft beep)

13:36.607 --> 13:38.943
(whirring)

13:56.085 --> 13:57.294
Hi, Lucy.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.381
Sorry about the hand.

14:00.464 --> 14:03.759
Must've really hurt.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.344
{\an1}Lucy.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.098
Do you know who I am?
Yes, ma'am.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.599
{\an3}You're Anna Schaefer.
You're in charge

14:10.683 --> 14:12.393
of the program for which
I am the prototype.

14:12.476 --> 14:15.104
{\an3}Your image is one
of 923 million

14:15.187 --> 14:18.566
memory implants that have been
encoded onto my neural net.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.068
Very good.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.488
Can I see myself?

14:26.740 --> 14:28.784
{\an3}Uh, sure.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.168
{\an3}Huh?

14:42.214 --> 14:45.175
Ethan. This is Lucy.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.595
Lucy, Ethan.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.305
I already know her.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.682
I just don't know her
in this body.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.434
Hi, Ethan.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.144
Still playing
<i>Space Battle?</i>

14:55.227 --> 14:57.855
I leveled out.
Now I'm more into <i> Robotrap</i>

14:57.938 --> 14:59.607
and <i> Spherical Chess.</i>

14:59.690 --> 15:00.733
Want to come see it?

15:00.816 --> 15:02.484
I have a good chess program.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.945
{\an1}Come on.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.448
{\an1}Lovely.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.867
{\an1}When can she perform
her field test?

15:09.950 --> 15:12.786
{\an4}JULIE:
We have to run through
her protocols first.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.455
She wasn't able to learn
by experience

15:14.538 --> 15:16.624
like Ethan did.
So we've

15:16.707 --> 15:19.376
{\an3}incorporated an empathic
response algorithm--

15:19.460 --> 15:21.962
an ethical adapter.
It's designed to

15:22.046 --> 15:25.132
mimic human complexity when
it comes to moral decisions.

15:25.215 --> 15:28.802
{\an1}You do know
what we're fighting here?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.388
{\an1}An alien life form.
JULIE: Of course.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.975
A hybrid's resting body
temperature is 84 degrees.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.562
And Lucy can detect that from
a distance of up to 100 feet.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.856
Her wiring makes her immune
to their screening capabilities.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.358
And her human appearance allows

15:42.441 --> 15:44.693
{\an6}her able to blend in
with a crowd.
Correct.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.364
{\an1}She can identify,
get close, then terminate.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.824
{\an1}I still have no idea where
ethics comes into play here.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.243
For morally ambiguous
situations that involve

15:53.327 --> 15:56.914
more than shoot or don't shoot.
To reduce human casualties.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.379
{\an1}Fine. Let's see how
she performs on her protocols.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.963
Of course.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.179
Are you trying to get yourself
thrown off this project?

16:12.262 --> 16:13.555
{\an1}She's our boss.
(door closes)

16:13.639 --> 16:15.432
Doesn't mean
I have to like her.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.436
SHEPHERD:
When I asked you to adjust

16:19.520 --> 16:21.730
{\an3}your testimony
to congress,

16:21.814 --> 16:23.857
I swear I thought
he was dead.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.859
Adjust my testimony?

16:25.943 --> 16:28.028
(laughing)

16:28.112 --> 16:31.907
Whose testimony did you adjust
to get me committed?

16:31.990 --> 16:34.743
I had nothing
to do with that.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.663
So you don't think I'm crazy?

16:39.289 --> 16:40.541
You were...

16:40.624 --> 16:42.710
distraught, rightfully,

16:42.793 --> 16:44.586
and your brain scans
showed abnormalities.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.088
{\an3}Whether that was
the radiation,

16:46.171 --> 16:47.756
I don't know.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.217
{\an3}But your behavior
was erratic, Molly.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.552
You can't deny it.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.887
Oh, I'll show you erratic,
you keep lying.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.269
We had the boy's body
in the morgue.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.438
<i>It was in some sort of stasis.</i>

17:02.521 --> 17:04.106
<i>Like an insect</i>

17:04.189 --> 17:06.316
in a larval state.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.069
<i>Then the larvae emerged</i>
<i>and we lost him, Mol.</i>

17:09.153 --> 17:11.446
<i>All we had was the</i>
<i>shell he left behind.</i>

17:11.530 --> 17:13.365
{\an3}Now, we knew he grew
at an accelerated rate.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.950
<i>We did age projections,</i>

17:15.032 --> 17:17.953
<i>computer extrapolations.</i>
<i>And then...</i>

17:18.037 --> 17:19.454
You found him.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.915
Yeah.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.084
And you.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.468
What were you doing
in that bar, Molly?

17:34.052 --> 17:35.596
Did you arrange the meeting?

17:37.055 --> 17:39.641
I had no idea
he was at that bar.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.144
{\an1}In my business, there's
no such thing as coincidence.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.855
You think I'm lying?

17:44.938 --> 17:46.857
I only lie, Toby,

17:46.940 --> 17:49.985
when my country asks me to.

17:51.695 --> 17:54.239
I thought you were my friend.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.824
I am.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.493
Really?

17:57.576 --> 17:59.495
Well, you're my first friend
that ever tried

17:59.578 --> 18:02.664
to blow me up
in a drone strike.

18:02.748 --> 18:06.126
I had to make that call.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.003
{\an3}You, more
than anyone,

18:08.086 --> 18:10.297
know what we're
up against here.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.633
{\an3}Which makes
you an asset.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.431
Okay.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.185
Well, if you want me
to help you,

18:23.268 --> 18:24.520
then you better tell me

18:24.603 --> 18:28.357
{\an3}everything.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.984
{\an6}SHEPHERD:
There are 29 known deaths
in the United States

18:31.068 --> 18:33.028
in the last six months.

18:33.111 --> 18:35.489
{\an3}All women who died
from accelerated pregnancies.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.659
All of which trace back
to the target.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.119
Your son.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.707
Show me the projections.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.961
In six weeks,
this many deaths.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.340
In six months...

18:59.137 --> 19:01.890
And for each one
of them, a birth.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.017
And what happens
to these babies?

19:04.101 --> 19:07.604
Who knows what's
out there now.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.856
We've tried
to stop him.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.399
But you know
the scenario.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.234
When my people get close,

19:12.317 --> 19:15.195
something happens.
Yeah, they turn on each other.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.864
We can't get close.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.367
But now we know that you can.

19:20.450 --> 19:23.412
He trusts you, Molly.

19:23.495 --> 19:27.082
We're running out
of options here.

19:27.165 --> 19:29.209
Help us.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.141
"'Does it hurt?'
asked the Rabbit.

19:44.224 --> 19:47.603
"'Sometimes.'
said the Skin Horse,

19:47.686 --> 19:49.479
"for he was always truthful.

19:49.563 --> 19:53.108
'When you are Real
you don't mind being hurt.'"

19:56.695 --> 19:58.113
It's an exciting day,

19:58.196 --> 19:59.781
meeting Lucy.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.742
I like having a sister.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.952
{\an3}She's fun.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.788
She says she's
going to be a soldier.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.790
Yeah, she is.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.460
{\an3}Am I going be
a soldier, too?

20:11.543 --> 20:13.795
You have to grow up first.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.131
But you weren't built
to be a soldier.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.300
What was I built for?

20:18.383 --> 20:19.927
To be you.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.762
To be Ethan.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.560
Good night, Rabbit.
Sweet dreams.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.569
Ethan.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.326
{\an1}(distantly):
Ethan?

20:44.409 --> 20:46.828
(crackling)
Are you all right?

20:48.789 --> 20:50.499
(distantly):
Ethan. Are you...

20:50.582 --> 20:52.125
(normally):
...all right?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.340
Yeah, Mom.
I'm all right.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.135
Okay. I'll see you
in the morning, then.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.016
{\an1}You are putting our fate
in the hands

21:08.100 --> 21:09.685
{\an1}of a woman
of questionable stability.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.520
Who happens to be our
best hope right now.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.022
We've tried drones,
we've tried SEALs.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.191
Sometimes the lone assassin
is more effective

21:16.274 --> 21:18.986
than ten battalions.
Yes...

21:19.069 --> 21:21.822
{\an1}if that assassin
can get the job done.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.908
A gun is much more powerful

21:24.992 --> 21:27.077
{\an1}than you.
The only part you control is

21:27.160 --> 21:29.871
pulling the trigger. If you
do it right, nothing else moves.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.206
Eye on the target,

21:31.289 --> 21:33.291
feel your finger
moving smoothly...

21:41.967 --> 21:43.885
Just make sure you don't
set your sights

21:43.969 --> 21:45.721
on the wrong target.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.557
Got it.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.862
{\an1}Nice shot.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.780
{\an3}You sure you haven't
done this before?

22:03.864 --> 22:06.199
{\an1}When I set my sights
on a target,

22:06.283 --> 22:08.452
I nail it.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.291
(gunfire)

22:17.502 --> 22:19.421
{\an4}JULIE:
I'm going to present you
with a series of statements,

22:19.504 --> 22:21.631
{\an1}and I want you to tell me
whether you agree or disagree.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.091
{\an1}And I want you
to answer truthfully,

22:23.175 --> 22:25.302
{\an1}not how you think
I want you to answer, okay?

22:27.054 --> 22:28.472
(tablet chimes)

22:28.555 --> 22:30.640
{\an1}"It would be inappropriate
to cheat on an exam,

22:30.724 --> 22:33.143
{\an1}even if it meant
I would get a better grade."

22:33.226 --> 22:34.603
{\an3}Agree.
(chimes)

22:34.686 --> 22:36.897
"If I caught someone stealing
from a bank,

22:36.980 --> 22:38.607
I should call
the police."

22:38.690 --> 22:40.442
{\an1}Agree.
"You're with a group

22:40.525 --> 22:42.444
"of people exploring a cave.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.404
{\an3}"One of them is pregnant.
She gets stuck

22:44.488 --> 22:46.406
"in the mouth of the cave.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.741
"You're running
out of oxygen.

22:47.824 --> 22:49.242
{\an1}"You have a stick
of dynamite.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.285
{\an1}"If you use it,
the woman will be killed.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.079
{\an1}"If you don't use it,
everyone else will suffocate.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.455
You should use the dynamite."

22:53.538 --> 22:55.749
(sighs)

22:55.832 --> 22:57.959
Pregnant woman in a cave.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.837
Wedged in the exit.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.798
(Lucy laughs)

23:02.881 --> 23:05.634
Lucy...

23:05.717 --> 23:07.094
here's a better one.

23:07.177 --> 23:09.304
You are a soldier

23:09.387 --> 23:10.847
assigned to kill a terrorist

23:10.931 --> 23:12.849
{\an1}responsible
for thousands of deaths.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.476
You have eyes on your target,

23:14.559 --> 23:15.977
{\an1}but he's taken refuge
in a school,

23:16.061 --> 23:18.647
and is surrounded
by small children.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.816
{\an1}You should blow up the school,
killing the children.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.570
Agree.

23:28.907 --> 23:33.203
Thank you, Lucy.

23:33.286 --> 23:34.162
CHARLIE:
<i>Killing a bunch</i>

23:34.246 --> 23:36.498
{\an1}of school children.
She didn't even flinch.

23:36.581 --> 23:39.167
She made the tough call, quickly

23:39.251 --> 23:40.877
and efficiently.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.629
{\an1}Now, those are the very calls
that she'll need

23:42.712 --> 23:43.880
to make in the field, so, we
shouldn't shy away from them.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.340
Yeah,
and she probably would have

23:45.423 --> 23:47.092
made the tough call
to launch nukes

23:47.175 --> 23:49.386
in the Cuban Missile Crisis,
without blinking an eye sensor.

23:49.469 --> 23:53.056
I don't have the luxury of
discussing battlefield ethics,

23:53.140 --> 23:56.393
as I have two colonels and a
senator breathing down my neck.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.687
Now, they would like to know
what all their research

23:58.770 --> 24:00.355
money has amounted to.

24:00.438 --> 24:03.650
So, we're gonna do a bit
of a bot and pony show.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.695
{\an1}Buy Lucy something
nice to wear.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.989
And congratulations.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.533
She is spectacular.

24:15.245 --> 24:18.540
Charlie, we can fix this,
tweak the algorithms.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.584
Keep telling yourself that.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.924
(lock beeps, door opens)

24:28.008 --> 24:30.844
(door closes)

24:30.927 --> 24:33.972
I'm General Tobias Shepherd.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.183
Yeah, I know who
you are, General.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.894
{\an3}I'm familiar
with your work.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.395
Second K, right?

24:40.478 --> 24:42.856
Second Kuwait War, yes.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.275
But you and I had very
different wars, Mr. Richter.

24:45.358 --> 24:47.485
I'll say we did.

24:47.569 --> 24:50.906
So I see you've just
kept on doing what you do.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.074
Your case has been
officially closed,

24:53.158 --> 24:55.035
so you're all done here.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.578
{\an3}Damn it.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.247
Just when I was starting
to enjoy the amenities.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.874
Go home, Mr. Richter.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.584
Go quietly about your life.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.420
And if you're quiet enough,
maybe I won't hear you.

25:05.503 --> 25:08.089
Funny. You know, that is
exactly what my C.O. told me

25:08.173 --> 25:09.633
when he handed me
my discharge papers.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.551
Should have listened.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.346
Listening to bullies
isn't my strong suit.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.476
Hey, General?

25:19.559 --> 25:22.103
What have you done
with Molly Woods?

25:22.187 --> 25:24.606
I recommend that you leave here,

25:24.689 --> 25:26.816
forget you ever met Dr. Woods.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.986
And that is
a strong recommendation.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.074
(lock beeps,
door opens, closes)

25:36.910 --> 25:39.246
Which one do
you prefer?

25:39.329 --> 25:40.664
I don't know.

25:40.747 --> 25:43.124
{\an1}Can I try on both?
Sure.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.628
There's a mirror over there if
you want to see how you look.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.969
It's kind of nice having
another female around.

25:54.052 --> 25:57.639
It can get pretty man-cave when
Charlie and Ethan get together.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.100
How about this one?

26:03.061 --> 26:05.146
Where did you get that?

26:05.230 --> 26:06.982
Your closet. Why?

26:07.065 --> 26:08.984
{\an3}Because it wasn't
an option.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.319
{\an1}Sorry, I just thought,
you have a closet

26:11.403 --> 26:13.280
full of things.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.699
{\an3}It's nice, but it's...
inappropriate.

26:15.782 --> 26:18.159
{\an3}You need to wear
something professional.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.996
This isn't professional?

26:21.079 --> 26:22.497
(laughs)

26:22.580 --> 26:24.165
No.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.836
Why don't you just go
put on the blue one?

26:32.590 --> 26:35.719
ETHAN:
<i>I love the tapioca balls.</i>

26:35.802 --> 26:38.054
{\an3}Oh, dude, you got to
love the tapioca balls.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.889
I wish Lucy could taste 'em.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.725
{\an3}We can get her
one if you want.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.935
Okay.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.400
{\an1}(stuttering):
This one-one is for you.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.323
Ethan?

26:57.615 --> 26:59.743
{\an3}Ethan?

26:59.826 --> 27:01.911
This one is for you.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.955
{\an6}CHARLIE:
<i>You okay, bud?</i>
Ethan!

27:04.956 --> 27:06.833
{\an3}(whirring)
Ethan?

27:06.916 --> 27:08.918
Ethan? Ethan?

27:09.002 --> 27:12.547
{\an3}Hey, buddy? Hey.
(whirring)

27:12.630 --> 27:14.049
Charlie...

27:14.132 --> 27:16.384
who's Molly?

27:25.185 --> 27:27.395
Do you like my outfit?

27:27.479 --> 27:30.398
{\an1}I don't know a lot
about girls' clothes.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.109
If you don't like it, you can
print clothes right here.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.570
{\an4}Really?
Julie does it
all the time.

27:35.653 --> 27:37.405
She printed me this T-shirt.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.115
That's pretty cool.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.117
You pick the design?

27:41.201 --> 27:43.036
Yeah, of course.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.541
(chimes)
Check.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.087
Mm.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.755
(chimes)
Checkmate.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.633
You're good.

27:56.716 --> 27:58.760
I told him he must have seen
her face on TV or something, but

27:58.843 --> 28:01.012
I think he still
may be glitchy.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.264
I took care

28:03.348 --> 28:05.016
of the immediate memory stammer.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.726
You deleted the memory?

28:06.810 --> 28:10.105
{\an1}Julie, Ethan knows
something's going on here.

28:10.188 --> 28:13.274
These glitches-- I don't know
if I can fix what you've done.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.318
{\an3}Charlie, he was
about to kill himself.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.278
{\an1}Look at him now.
Glitches and all, he's happy.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.446
You can't argue with that.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.948
Just seems like we keep making

28:20.031 --> 28:21.616
{\an3}excuses for
ethically-ambiguous

28:21.699 --> 28:23.284
choices here, don't you think?

28:23.368 --> 28:24.744
What are you saying?

28:24.828 --> 28:26.121
I'm saying...

28:26.204 --> 28:27.789
I've got my own ethical adapter,

28:27.872 --> 28:29.749
and its little alarm bells
keep going off,

28:29.833 --> 28:31.459
over and over again.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.128
Sometimes you have to make
choices for the greater good,

28:33.211 --> 28:34.712
{\an1}Charlie.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.423
The greater good? Julie,
you wiped Ethan's memory.

28:36.506 --> 28:37.924
Lucy's killing
school children

28:38.007 --> 28:39.676
without even hesitating.

28:39.759 --> 28:41.845
And now you're letting her bond
with Ethan. It's like...

28:41.928 --> 28:45.348
If you have a problem with
the way I run this operation...

28:45.432 --> 28:47.809
you can go find yourself
another job.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.981
I promised Ethan I'd stay.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.483
I wanted to stay for you, too,

28:55.567 --> 28:57.485
because I cared about you.

28:57.569 --> 29:01.698
{\an3}You were kind,
you were brilliant.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.366
You were so damn perfect,

29:03.450 --> 29:04.826
I couldn't even tell you
how I felt about you.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.245
{\an3}But now, I can say
it to your face,

29:07.328 --> 29:11.291
'cause you're not
that person anymore.

29:13.793 --> 29:16.171
SHEPHERD:
<i>We know he'll seek you out.</i>

29:16.254 --> 29:18.840
We're running facial recognition

29:18.923 --> 29:21.050
against his image
with every surveillance camera

29:21.134 --> 29:22.969
within a thousand-mile radius.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.013
{\an1}The moment we know
he's coming, you'll know.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.848
{\an1}Meantime, go home
and wait.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.475
What about RestWell?

29:28.558 --> 29:30.185
I made that go away.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.561
And JD Richter?

29:31.644 --> 29:33.313
{\an3}Did you make that
go away, too?

29:33.396 --> 29:34.689
Because, you know,
this was his case.

29:34.772 --> 29:37.025
Not anymore.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.028
We need to keep the circle tight
to get the job done.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.530
Yeah. I understand.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.576
{\an1}Molly,

29:46.659 --> 29:49.829
that call, the drone--

29:49.913 --> 29:52.749
it was the hardest thing
I ever had to do.

29:52.832 --> 29:55.877
{\an1}I just want you
to know that.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.587
{\an1}Sir?

29:57.670 --> 29:59.547
{\an1}They're asking for us
in Surveillance.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.884
{\an1}Thank you, Shayna.
I'll be right there.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.886
You be ready for my call.

30:04.969 --> 30:08.056
You keep your phone on you,
and the gun.

30:10.600 --> 30:14.020
Molly.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.523
I need to know

30:16.606 --> 30:20.401
{\an1}when the time comes, you'll be
able to pull that trigger.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.862
(elevator chimes)

30:29.494 --> 30:31.829
We'll find out, won't we?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.586
I remember the arguments when we
introduced the self-driving car.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.588
{\an4}Mm.
It was so hard
to convince people

30:40.672 --> 30:42.924
{\an1}that the most dangerous factor
on the road was human error.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.260
Well, the same can be said of
the battlefield, which is why

30:45.343 --> 30:47.095
what we have here is
so extraordinary.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.556
And here we have
the woman of the hour.

30:49.639 --> 30:50.974
One of them anyway.
Julie Gelineau.

30:51.057 --> 30:52.934
This is Senator Blake Stone.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.602
We have Colonels Davis
and Cramer and Gianna Pelton

30:54.686 --> 30:55.937
from Yolodyne.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.106
{\an3}Julie here has done
incredible work

30:58.189 --> 31:00.108
under incredible pressure.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.776
So, where is she?

31:01.859 --> 31:04.529
{\an1}Lucy's getting ready.
She'll be out in a minute.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.622
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:14.706 --> 31:18.084
{\an3}may I present Lucy,
the future of Humanichs?

31:18.167 --> 31:21.129
(applause)

31:23.381 --> 31:24.757
What's up, bud?

31:24.841 --> 31:27.302
{\an3}You want straight Scotch
or gin and tonic?

31:27.385 --> 31:28.803
{\an3}Ginger ale.

31:28.886 --> 31:31.097
{\an3}Ginger ale's more
your speed, I think.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.850
{\an6}(clears her throat)
Did you steal that
dress from my closet?

31:33.933 --> 31:36.311
No. I printed it out.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.813
{\an1}Ethan showed me how.
Is there something wrong?

31:38.896 --> 31:41.816
{\an3}I specifically told you
it was inappropriate.

31:41.899 --> 31:43.526
{\an1}ANNA:
My people are blown away.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.944
{\an3}They can't believe
how human she feels.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.113
{\an6}(laughs)
We all agree
we'd like to see

31:47.196 --> 31:48.656
{\an1}a field test right away,
so, I assured them

31:48.740 --> 31:50.491
{\an1}that there wouldn't be
a problem with that.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.327
{\an3}I...
I'll tell Charlie.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.829
Julie, congratulations.

31:54.912 --> 31:57.290
{\an1}You and Charlie have really
outdone yourselves.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.002
Hey. Nice dress.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.171
You made quite the entrance.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.173
Well, I think Julie's mad at me.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.675
Oh, well, that won't last long.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.135
I think you look pretty.

32:09.218 --> 32:10.511
{\an3}Thanks.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.681
{\an3}They said I'm ready
for the field.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.183
I want to learn, Charlie.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.478
{\an3}I want to get all
of the answers right.

32:18.561 --> 32:20.104
(laughs)

32:27.320 --> 32:29.781
(insects chirping)

32:34.243 --> 32:37.705
(sighs)

32:37.789 --> 32:41.167
(door opens)

32:50.468 --> 32:53.888
(floorboards creaking)

33:04.315 --> 33:06.067
{\an3}(gasps)

33:06.150 --> 33:08.027
What's up, Doc?

33:18.705 --> 33:20.915
You know how to use that thing?

33:20.998 --> 33:22.834
You want to find out?

33:22.917 --> 33:25.044
Why don't you do us both a favor
and put that down.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.755
Nope. Not just yet.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.133
What can I do for you?

33:30.216 --> 33:32.927
(chuckling):
What can you do for me?

33:34.303 --> 33:36.431
(sighs)
I was just interrogated

33:36.514 --> 33:39.726
and roughed up
by some government spooks.

33:39.809 --> 33:41.936
Kind of thought maybe the
same thing had happened to you,

33:42.019 --> 33:44.147
{\an1}and I was worried.
But now that I see you,

33:44.230 --> 33:47.442
well, you look
positively glowing.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.402
{\an1}So what
I'm wondering

33:49.485 --> 33:50.903
is why some people get
the Shinola

33:50.987 --> 33:52.113
and other people get the sh...

33:52.196 --> 33:55.074
All right, look, you stepped

33:55.158 --> 33:57.744
{\an3}in this mess
all by yourself.

33:57.827 --> 34:00.121
{\an3}You know what
I suggest you do?

34:00.204 --> 34:02.457
Clean off your boots

34:02.540 --> 34:05.626
{\an3}and find yourself
another case.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.087
{\an1}You know,
I would take that advice.

34:08.170 --> 34:11.466
I really would.

34:11.549 --> 34:15.178
{\an1}The problem is, Big Brother
not only took my case

34:15.261 --> 34:17.722
but he also took my license.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.850
Really?

34:20.933 --> 34:22.810
Really.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.603
I'm so sorry.

34:24.687 --> 34:27.315
Sorry doesn't keep me in beer
and cowboy boots.

34:27.398 --> 34:30.485
{\an1}You sort of buried
the lead there, Molly.

34:30.568 --> 34:35.114
You failed to mention
that we were looking for your

34:35.197 --> 34:38.117
{\an1}30-year-old son.
Which, by the way,

34:38.201 --> 34:40.661
{\an1}how is that
even possible?

34:40.745 --> 34:44.206
{\an4}It's complicated.
Here's
what I know.

34:44.290 --> 34:49.504
I'm outside a bar talking to you
and... your son,

34:49.587 --> 34:52.005
{\an1}and the next thing
I know

34:52.089 --> 34:53.841
I'm back in Kuwait,

34:53.925 --> 34:57.845
watching my company
drop to friendly fire.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.557
{\an1}And when I wake up,
I'm holding a gun to my head.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.851
Let's just say
my mind has been expanded

35:03.935 --> 35:07.021
by my evening spent in Oz.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.481
So, Molly,

35:08.564 --> 35:12.693
if you want
to claim flying monkeys...

35:12.777 --> 35:15.404
I'm listening.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.535
ETHAN:
Good night, Charlie.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.328
(chimes)

35:25.331 --> 35:27.875
{\an1}JULIE:
Thanks for coming over.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.419
Ethan likes it
when you put him to bed.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.755
I like putting him to bed.

35:32.839 --> 35:34.215
Congratulations

35:34.298 --> 35:36.008
{\an3}on a successful
night.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.511
Thanks. You, too.
(chuckles)

35:38.594 --> 35:41.722
All right, I should go.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.392
Charlie, did you...

35:44.475 --> 35:46.853
mean all those things...

35:46.936 --> 35:48.896
that you said?

35:48.980 --> 35:52.191
The good, the bad, and the ugly.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.193
I was angry.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.612
I mean, I said things

35:56.696 --> 35:59.282
{\an1}I regret.

35:59.365 --> 36:01.325
But, um, I thought a lot

36:01.409 --> 36:03.786
about what you said
about me quitting, and...

36:03.870 --> 36:05.329
{\an1}if you think
that's for the best...

36:05.413 --> 36:07.415
No, I didn't mean any
of those things.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.044
Don't leave Ethan.

36:13.379 --> 36:16.382
Or me.

36:16.465 --> 36:19.427
Why not?

36:30.688 --> 36:34.609
All right, let me...
let me get this straight.

36:34.692 --> 36:39.071
You're saying that you went
to space alone for 13 months

36:39.155 --> 36:41.908
and you came back pregnant.

36:41.991 --> 36:45.119
Yes. And they took my baby

36:45.202 --> 36:46.954
{\an1}from me
prematurely.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.957
{\an1}He had
accelerated growth.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.418
But I really...

36:52.501 --> 36:55.004
thought he was dead.

37:00.718 --> 37:05.640
And now your grown
half-alien son is our perp.

37:05.723 --> 37:09.602
{\an3}He's getting these women
pregnant, which is, in fact,

37:09.685 --> 37:12.605
killing them.

37:12.688 --> 37:15.232
Yes.

37:19.111 --> 37:20.529
{\an3}(groans)

37:20.613 --> 37:22.990
You're right.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.994
{\an3}You're right.
My mind is blown.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.496
Now I need a drink.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.331
Or ten.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.083
You want one?

37:34.418 --> 37:36.337
Uh, no.

37:36.420 --> 37:39.799
JD, I'm really sorry
you got involved in all this,

37:39.882 --> 37:41.968
{\an5}but you're gonna
have to go now.
What are you talking about?

37:42.051 --> 37:44.303
You just told me we're in
the midst of an alien invasion,

37:44.387 --> 37:46.222
and I actually believe you.

37:46.305 --> 37:49.350
If ever there was time
for a drink, it's now.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.352
Hey.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.479
Hey, are you all right?

37:55.648 --> 37:57.525
You're gonna have to go now.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.695
No. No, I'm not gonna go.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.697
{\an4}We're not done
here.
Yes, we are.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.532
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.701
I liked it a lot better
when that was on the table.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.703
(panting)

38:08.786 --> 38:11.706
Get out of my apartment,
right now.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.166
(gunshot)

38:14.250 --> 38:15.376
Go!

38:15.459 --> 38:19.046
Nice knowing you, Molly.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.846
(door closes,
electrical crackling)

38:29.849 --> 38:31.726
(panting)
(power winding down)

38:31.809 --> 38:33.769
GINA:
System on battery backup power.

38:35.312 --> 38:37.106
Sir, there's some sort of surge.

38:37.189 --> 38:39.442
The whole neighborhood's
gone dark.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.860
20 square blocks.
There's a blackout.

38:40.943 --> 38:42.737
Molly Woods' apartment
is dead center.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.740
He's there.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.742
(line ringing)

38:47.825 --> 38:52.038
Toby, he's coming for me.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.581
I know.
You asked me

38:53.664 --> 38:56.042
if I could pull the trigger.

38:56.125 --> 38:58.252
But I don't know if I can.

38:58.335 --> 38:59.754
Molly,

38:59.837 --> 39:01.839
you know what's at stake here.

39:01.922 --> 39:05.259
It's the right thing.
It's the only thing to do.

39:05.342 --> 39:07.511
I know.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.930
But he's my son.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.896
Molly.

39:16.979 --> 39:18.189
Molly!

39:27.406 --> 39:29.867
(shuddering breaths)

39:30.868 --> 39:33.287
Hello, Mother.

39:43.380 --> 39:46.509
Is that what you want,
to kill me?

39:46.592 --> 39:49.553
(shuddering breaths)
What I want is to know

39:49.637 --> 39:52.473
what the hell is going on here,
why you're here,

39:52.556 --> 39:54.475
and what you want.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.477
You want to know why I'm here?

39:56.560 --> 39:58.145
I'll show you.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.481
Or you can just pull
the trigger.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.821
Killing people isn't the nature
of my mission.

40:06.904 --> 40:09.281
Then what exactly
is your mission?

40:09.365 --> 40:12.159
Because people are dying, Ahdu.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.829
You don't understand, Mother.

40:14.912 --> 40:18.457
What more is there
for me to understand?

40:18.541 --> 40:21.001
So very much.

40:27.424 --> 40:30.344
See for yourself.

40:30.427 --> 40:31.971
(eerie whispering)

40:34.598 --> 40:37.685
Oh, God.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.019
(eerie whispering)

40:39.103 --> 40:40.980
(shuddering breaths)

40:44.066 --> 40:47.528
{\an3}Behold a vision
of our destiny, Mother.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.363
{\an3}Oh, God.

40:49.446 --> 40:50.865
This can't be happening.

40:50.948 --> 40:53.868
{\an3}This is the
future, Molly.

40:53.951 --> 40:56.745
You're gonna have to
make a choice soon.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.372
Are you with them

40:58.455 --> 41:00.374
{\an3}or us?

41:00.457 --> 41:02.334
Oh, no, God.

41:08.841 --> 41:10.718
(revs engine)

41:15.306 --> 41:17.474
(cocks gun)

41:19.101 --> 41:20.394
{\an3}Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

41:20.477 --> 41:22.688
Whoa. Don't shoot.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.233
Kelsey?

41:26.317 --> 41:29.695
Hi, Dad.

41:29.778 --> 41:33.407
You know, if today's the day
you've come to tell me

41:33.490 --> 41:37.578
what I crappy father I am
or to borrow money...

41:37.661 --> 41:41.832
let me tell you something,
you picked the wrong day.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.460
I'm pregnant.

42:10.444 --> 42:12.655
(gunshots)

42:14.698 --> 42:17.618
I'm sorry, Ahdu,

42:17.701 --> 42:20.704
but I'm with them.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.585
(panting)

42:30.714 --> 42:33.133
(shuddering breaths)

42:41.350 --> 42:43.310
Oh, my God. Toby.
