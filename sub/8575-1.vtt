21:48.183 --> 21:49.351

And the third reason
you're 30 points behind

21:53.021 --> 21:55.701
is 'cause you guys have Castillo

21:55.941 --> 21:59.319

Being warm isn't him, smiling isn't him,

Castillo is considered
arrogant, unapproachable,

- and out of touch with people's lives.
- JANE: Mmm-hmm.

Pretty much won the election for Johnson,
and it was shown once.

23:18.023 --> 23:19.316
Basically, this ad suggested

23:19.524 --> 23:21.526
that if Goldwater got in
instead of Johnson,

23:21.735 --> 23:23.236
the crazy bastard would unleash

23:23.445 --> 23:25.947
a nuclear holocaust that would
just blow up the world.

23:26.198 --> 23:28.366

<i>You see, when voters are looking for hope,

23:34.289 --> 23:35.749

23:36.792 --> 23:38.794
they look for a wartime leader.

23:39.211 --> 23:40.712
They look for a guy who,

23:40.921 --> 23:42.631
when you come at him with an egg,

23:42.881 --> 23:44.674
he doesn't have time for fun and games.

23:44.883 --> 23:48.053
No, he's gonna put you down,
and he's gonna punch you in the face!

23:48.303 --> 23:50.889

is gonna be about.

23:51.139 --> 23:56.353
Our story is Bolivia is facing
the worst period in its turbulent history.

23:56.561 --> 23:59.439
We are at a crossroads,
and Bolivians face a choice.

23:59.648 --> 24:01.691
They have Rivera, a man of no substance,

24:01.900 --> 24:04.653
a man of no experience,
an everyman opportunist,

24:04.903 --> 24:08.907
who will stand by and watch
as this nation falls apart,

24:09.116 --> 24:11.743
or they can choose Castillo.

24:12.244 --> 24:13.495
You might not like him.

24:13.745 --> 24:16.164
You might think
he's an arrogant son of a bitch.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.333
But he is a fighter.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.877
He has grit, he has experience,

24:21.086 --> 24:23.880
and he's got balls,
and he is the only choice.

24:24.089 --> 24:25.924
The only choice to save the day.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.592
These are the stakes.

24:27.801 --> 24:31.221
We are trying to save
people's lives, okay?

24:31.429 --> 24:33.682
But this is no longer an election.

24:35.851 --> 24:37.644

- BEN: <i>Really?</i>
- And it says that the leader of the cult

but we have to make it clear

01:06:09.884 --> 01:06:11.427
that you are not a member of

Why don't you want

you are a legitimate target.

aren't necessarily involved.

He's had his difficulties.
But you love him very much.
