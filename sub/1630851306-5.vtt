ACT ON IT.

CAUSED DEEP RIFTS WITHIN THE

01:09.871 --> 01:12.573
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

EMBRACE REPUBLICAN ISM

02:08.844 --> 02:10.279
EMBRACE REPUBLICATRUMPISM.

02:10.379 --> 02:12.914
>> A RECORD NUMBER OF AMERICANS
VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

02:13.014 --> 02:16.049
THE PARTY IS HIS.
IT DOESN'T BELONG TO ANYBODY

02:16.150 --> 02:34.529
ELSE.

02:54.009 --> 02:59.078

BIDEN ERA.
WE SPENT THE LAST TEN DAYS

03:22.794 --> 03:25.696
FOCUSED ON THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE ACTION NOW IS GOING TO BE

03:25.796 --> 03:31.534
SQUARELY ON CAPITOL HILL.
BOY, IS CAPITOL HILL FUCKED UP.

03:31.634 --> 03:35.203
THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF STUFF
THAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THE

03:35.303 --> 03:36.304
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

03:36.637 --> 03:40.473
>> THE LEADERSHIP OF LIZ CHENEY
IS BEING THREATENED JUST BECAUSE

03:40.574 --> 03:46.244
SHE WAS WILLING TO STAND UP AND
SAY, YES, WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO

03:46.344 --> 03:53.416
VIOLATED HIS ONLY OF OFFICE AND
INCITED AN INSURRECTION.

03:53.515 --> 03:59.253
>> LIZ CHENEY IS CONSIDERED A
RINO.

03:59.353 --> 04:03.922
>> MARJORY TAYLOR GREENE WHO HAS
BECOME LIKE THE HEADLIGHTS OF

04:04.022 --> 04:05.224
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

04:05.324 --> 04:08.492
>> REPUBLICANS KNEW THAT MARJORY
TAYLOR GREENE WAS GOING TO BE A

04:08.593 --> 04:10.594
PROBLEM EVEN WHEN SHE WAS A
CANDIDATE.

04:10.694 --> 04:13.662
THEY DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING
TO STOP HER.

04:13.762 --> 04:17.265
NOW HER PRESENCE HAS BECOME
OUTSIZED AS MORE AND MORE

04:17.365 --> 04:25.537
INFORMATION COMES OUT ABOUT THE
TOTALLY INSANE SHIT SHE BELIEVES

04:25.637 --> 04:26.004
IN.

04:26.838 --> 04:32.075
>> WE DO NOT KNOW WHO Q IS.
WE WITNESSED 9/11, TERRORIST

04:32.175 --> 04:36.144
ATTACK, THERE'S NEVER ANY
EVIDENCE SHOWN FOR A PLANE IN

04:36.245 --> 04:41.948
THE PENTAGON.
MANY OFFICIALS WILL -- EVERY

04:42.048 --> 04:45.818
SINGLE ONE OF THEM THAT IS
OBSTRUCTING TRUMP POLICIES, THEY

04:45.918 --> 04:48.419
SHOULD FEAR US.

04:48.519 --> 04:55.391
>> THIS IS SOMEONE SO FAR DOWN
THE QANON RABBIT HOLE, SHE MAY

04:55.491 --> 04:59.059
HAVE CAUGHT THE RABBIT.
SHE RAISED $1.6 MILLION LAST

04:59.159 --> 04:59.593
WEEK.

05:00.327 --> 05:02.295
>> KEVIN McCARTHY, HOUSE
MINORITY LEADER, SAID HE WILL

05:02.395 --> 05:04.197
TALK TO HER.
TAKE HER ASIDE AND HAVE A

05:04.297 --> 05:05.430
CONVERSATION WITH HER.

05:05.530 --> 05:08.566
>> SHE KNOWS KEVIN McCARTHY IS
BETWEEN A ROCK AND HARD PLACE.

05:08.666 --> 05:13.136
HE WANTS TO DISAVOW THE CRAZIES.
HE WANTS IT SEE TRUMP IN THE

05:13.236 --> 05:14.004
REAR VIEW.
HE CAN'T.

05:14.104 --> 05:15.304
THAT'S WHERE THE BASE OF THE
PARTY IS.

05:15.404 --> 05:17.306
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING
FROM.

05:17.406 --> 05:20.341
>> THAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM FOR
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RIGHT NOW.

05:20.441 --> 05:22.309
THEY CAN'T LIVE WITH DONALD
TRUMP AND THEY CAN'T LIVE

05:22.409 --> 05:23.477
WITHOUT HIM.

05:23.577 --> 05:27.545
>> THEY TOLERATE AND ENABLED
DONALD TRUMP FOR FOUR YEARS.

05:27.646 --> 05:29.914
THEY TOLERATE AND ENABLE
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS.

05:30.014 --> 05:33.249
THEY ARE SHOCKED WHEN THEY
BECOME THEIR COLLEAGUES.

05:33.349 --> 05:36.785
>> YOU HAVE NOT JUST THE USUAL
PARTISAN DIVISION.

05:36.885 --> 05:41.822
YOU HAVE OPEN HOSTILITY AND
FEAR.

05:41.923 --> 05:42.389
>> DEMOCRATS WHO RYUN

05:42.489 --> 05:43.189
>> DEMOCRATS WHO RYARE

05:43.690 --> 05:46.792
>> DEMOCRATS WHO RYA ARE UPSET
REPUBLICANS AREN'T WEARING

05:46.892 --> 05:49.961
MASKS.
I WILL CARRY A WEAPON WITH ME.

05:50.061 --> 05:53.864
WE HAVE MEMBERS ASKING TO HAVE
THEIR OFFICE MOVED FROM FEAR OF

05:53.964 --> 05:55.598
PERSONAL SAFETY.
THAT'S INSANE.

05:55.698 --> 05:58.633
>> I WORKED IN POLITICS FOR 25
YEARS.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.969
I HAVE SEEN DYSFUNCTIONAL
POLITICS IN THE CONGRESS.

06:02.069 --> 06:07.172
THIS IS LIKE SO BEYOND YOUR
IMAGINATION OF HOW BAD POLITICS

06:07.272 --> 06:08.040
CAN GET.

06:08.540 --> 06:12.510
>> WE HAVE BEEN ON A ONE-WAY
TRAIN TO RADICALIZED CRAZY TOWN.

06:12.610 --> 06:16.845
>> JOE BIDEN LOOKS DOWN
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AND HE SEES

06:16.946 --> 06:22.450
DYSFUNCTION JUNCTION.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.885
>> A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS PLAYING OUT

06:25.985 --> 06:27.053
ON CAPITOL HILL THIS MORNING.

06:27.153 --> 06:33.157
>> MINORITY LEADER MITCH
McCONNELL UNLEASHED A SKANL

06:33.257 --> 06:35.059
McCONNELL UNLEASHED A SKACATHIN
ATTACK AGAINST MARJORY TAYLOR

06:35.158 --> 06:35.658
GREENE.

06:36.459 --> 06:39.294
>> A TRUE PROXY WAR HAS BROKEN
OUT WITH MITCH McCONNELL COMING

06:39.394 --> 06:42.797
OUT CALLING MARJORY TAYLOR
GREENE'S COMMENTS LOONEY LIES

06:42.897 --> 06:47.933
AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT ARE
CANCER ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

06:48.033 --> 06:53.137
WE HAVE THE TRUMP WING AND THE
McCONNELL WINGS NOW AT WAR.

06:53.237 --> 06:56.707
A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY IN
THE MIDDLE IS ROB PORTMAN,

06:56.807 --> 07:01.743
REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM OHIO.
PORTMAN SAID HE IS NOT GOING TO

07:01.843 --> 07:07.947
RUN FOR RE-ELECTION.
HE DECIDED TO GET OFF THE CRAZY

07:08.047 --> 07:08.881
TRAIN.

07:09.115 --> 07:13.617
>> HOW ARE YOU?
YOU AND I SERVED TOGETHER UNDER

07:13.718 --> 07:16.519
GEORGE BUSH DURING THE
COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE DAYS.

07:16.619 --> 07:19.388
NOW YOU ARE LEAVING.

07:19.488 --> 07:21.256
>> I LEFT THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.424
I DID STAY IN THE HOUSE 12
YEARS.

07:23.524 --> 07:27.194
TO ME, THE REWARDS OF PUBLIC
SERVICE, WHICH ARE GREAT, ARE

07:27.294 --> 07:29.929
DIMINISHED A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE
IT'S HARDER TO GET THINGS DONE.

07:30.029 --> 07:31.629
>> YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT WHERE
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS RIGHT

07:31.730 --> 07:33.264
NOW.

07:33.365 --> 07:42.537
>> I THINK OUR PARTY IS TRYING
TO DOE FINE

07:42.637 --> 07:43.704
TO DOE FE TO DOE F DEFINE
ITSELF.

07:43.804 --> 07:45.806
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RESULTS
FROM THE 2020 ELECTION, THE

07:45.906 --> 07:48.541
REPUBLICAN PARTY DID QUITE WELL.

07:48.641 --> 07:51.543
>> ABSENT TRUMP.
EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.

07:51.643 --> 07:54.145
>> EVERYWHERE.
FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ITSELF,

07:54.245 --> 07:56.079
THE MESSAGE WASN'T THE PROBLEM.

07:56.179 --> 07:58.849
>> THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, SHOULD

07:58.949 --> 08:01.083
DONALD TRUMP BE IN THAT
EQUATION?

08:01.183 --> 08:06.220
YOU ARE AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE.
YOU DID NOT VOTE FOR TRUMP IN

08:06.320 --> 08:08.022
'16.
THEN SUPPORTED HIM DURING THE

08:08.122 --> 08:10.323
LAST FOUR YEARS, 88% OF THE
TIME.

08:10.423 --> 08:14.459
>> I THINK DONALD TRUMP'S
POLICIES WERE AND WOULD BE FAR

08:14.559 --> 08:15.893
BETTER FOR MY STATE AND THE
COUNTRY.

08:15.993 --> 08:19.829
MY HOPE IS THAT THE STYLE AND
PERSONALITY DOESN'T DEFINE OUR

08:19.929 --> 08:21.196
PARTY BUT RATHER THE POLICIES.

08:21.296 --> 08:24.532
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT
DONALD TRUMP AND MARJORY TAYLOR

08:24.632 --> 08:26.267
GREENE ARE BECOMING THE FACE OF
THE PARTY.

08:26.367 --> 08:28.201
IS THAT PROBLEMATIC GOING
FORWARD?

08:28.301 --> 08:30.103
>> IT WOULD BE IF YOU WERE
RIGHT.

08:30.202 --> 08:31.871
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE THE FACE
OF THE PARTY.

08:31.971 --> 08:35.140
THAT'S WHAT THE MEDIA MAYBE IS
FOCUSED ON RIGHT NOW.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.408
I HAVE SPOKEN OUT AGAINST WHAT
SHE SAID.

08:37.508 --> 08:42.478
SO HAS MITCH McCONNELL.
I HOPE KEVIN McCARTHY WILL DO

08:42.578 --> 08:49.749
THE SAME.
THERE HAS TO BE CONSEQUENCES.

08:49.849 --> 08:52.451
>> IT REALLY IS A CRITICAL DAY
FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

08:52.551 --> 08:56.587
LIZ CHENEY IS FIGHTING TO KEEP
HER LEADERSHIP POST AND MARJORY

08:56.687 --> 09:01.224
TAYLOR GREENE IS FIGHTING TO
KEEP HER SPOT ON THE EDUCATION

09:01.323 --> 09:02.124
COMMITTEE.
HOURS FROM NOW, REPUBLICANS WILL

09:02.224 --> 09:05.527
HOLD A MEETING TO DEBATE THEIR
FATE.

09:05.627 --> 09:09.129
>> WE ARE AN HOUR AND A HALF
OUTSIDE OF ATLANTA IN THE 14th

09:09.229 --> 09:11.330
DISTRICT OF THE STATE OF
GEORGIA, WHICH IS THE DISTRICT

09:11.431 --> 09:16.101
THAT IS HOME TO MARJORY TAYLOR
GREENE'S POLITICAL AMBITIONS.

09:16.201 --> 09:20.036
PRESIDENT TRUMP WON HERE NEARLY
THREE-QUARTERS OF THE VOTE.

09:20.136 --> 09:23.105
THE SAME FOR MARJORY TAYLOR
GREENE.

09:23.205 --> 09:25.174
>> WE GET TO PICK WHO OUR
REPRESENTATIVE IS.

09:25.274 --> 09:28.476
WE DON'T WANT THE NATIONAL MEDIA
OR DEMOCRATS TO DEFINE THIS

09:28.576 --> 09:38.583
PERSON.
THAT'S WHO THE VOTERS CHOSE.

09:38.682 --> 09:41.118
WE WANT OUR VOICE AND OUR
REPRESENTATION IN WASHINGTON.

09:41.218 --> 09:44.253
>> I GET THAT.
SHE SAID CRAZY SHIT.

09:44.353 --> 09:49.557
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE ARE
UPSET WITH THE THINGS SHE SAID.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.025
NOBODY SUPPORTS SOME OF THE
REALLY OUTLANDISH THINGS.

09:51.124 --> 09:55.627
SHE SHOULD REALIZE THE PEOPLE IN
THE DISTRICT WANT ANSWERS TO THE

09:55.727 --> 09:57.662
QUESTIONS.
THAT'S NOT THE MARJORY THAT

09:57.762 --> 09:58.563
CAMPAIGNED HERE.

09:58.896 --> 10:00.697
>> YOU SENT A LETTER THAT IS
SAYING, WE STAND BY HER.

10:00.797 --> 10:05.267
>> YEAH.
WE WANT AN EXPLANATION.

10:05.367 --> 10:06.801
>> YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE
ENOUGH?

10:06.901 --> 10:09.471
>> A STEP IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION, FOR SURE.

10:09.571 --> 10:12.905
>> THERE ARE DEMOCRATS IN
CONGRESS WHO SAY, WE CAN'T HAVE

10:13.005 --> 10:16.842
THIS WOMAN IN HERE, WE CAN'T
HAVE HER BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE

10:16.942 --> 10:19.743
OUR LIVES ARE BEING THREATENED.

10:19.844 --> 10:21.445
>> I THINK THAT'S CRAZY.

10:21.545 --> 10:24.814
>> YOU THINK THAT'S CRAZY?

10:24.914 --> 10:26.548
>> PEOPLE LIKE MARJORY --

10:26.648 --> 10:32.819
>> SHE DID RUN A CAMPAIGN WITH
OMAR'S FACE NEXT TO AN AR-15.

10:32.919 --> 10:35.754
>> SHE USED IT AS A CRUTCH IN
HER DISTRICT.

10:35.855 --> 10:36.655
>> THAT'S ABOUT ASEMI

10:36.755 --> 10:43.427
>> THAT'S ABOUT ASE SEMIAUTOMAT
RIFLE --

10:43.527 --> 10:47.662
>> THE WAY I RECALL THE AD, IT
WAS THESE CONGRESS WOMEN

10:47.762 --> 10:50.431
WAS THESE CONGRESS WOWOMEN WANT
TAKE YOUR WEAPONS.

10:50.531 --> 10:51.866
IT WAS A JUXTAPOSITION --

10:51.966 --> 10:54.134
>> DID NOT LEAVE A LOT OF
MYSTERY.

10:54.234 --> 10:57.069
>> I'M SURE SHE WAS NOT CALLING
FOR VIOLENCE WITH THAT POST.

10:57.169 --> 10:59.704
SURLY NOT.
IN LIGHT OF JANUARY 6, I THINK

10:59.804 --> 11:02.606
WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT
OUR RHETORIC.

11:02.706 --> 11:06.609
THE WHOLE STOP THE STEAL THING,
I THINK REALLY SENT THE WRONG

11:06.709 --> 11:11.446
IDEA TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.
I THINK OUR REPUBLICAN SENATOR

11:11.546 --> 11:14.348
CANDIDATES LOST IN LARGE PART
BECAUSE THAT RHETORIC CAUSED

11:14.448 --> 11:15.815
PEOPLE TO NOT COME OUT AND VOTE.

11:15.915 --> 11:17.350
>> SHE WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE
TALKING ABOUT STOPPING THE

11:17.450 --> 11:21.719
STEAL.
DEMOCRATS NOW HAVE THEIR KNIVES

11:21.819 --> 11:23.420
OUT.
THEY WANT TO HAVE HER REMOVED

11:23.521 --> 11:26.689
FROM HER COMMITTEES.
DOES THAT STRENGTHEN HER HAND IN

11:26.789 --> 11:27.723
THE 14th DISTRICT?

11:27.823 --> 11:31.325
>> IN A WAY IT DOES.
IF SHE'S REMOVED FROM THE

11:31.425 --> 11:35.362
COMMITTEES, IT WILL BE A STEP TO
CONTINUE THE ARGUMENT THAT

11:35.462 --> 11:36.363
CONSERVATIVES ARE GETTING
CANCELED.

11:36.463 --> 11:43.400
SHE WILL USE THAT TO HER
ADVANTAGE.

11:43.500 --> 11:47.737
>> TOP HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE
PLANNING TO DELIVER AN ULTIMATUM

11:47.837 --> 11:48.938
PLANNING TO DELIVER AN ULTIM
ULTIMATUM.

11:49.038 --> 11:50.405
>> YOU HAVE TO STRIP GREENE OF
HER COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS OR

11:50.505 --> 11:54.675
DEMOCRATS WILL BRING THE ISSUE
TO THE HOUSE FLOOR.

11:54.775 --> 11:57.410
>> ENCOURAGED VIOLENCE AGAINST
MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTION.

11:57.510 --> 12:03.748
IF THIS ISN'T THE BOTTOM LINE, I
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE HELL THE

12:03.848 --> 12:06.216
BOTTOM LINE IS.

12:06.316 --> 12:13.588
>> NEW MEMBER FROM ATLANTA FEELS
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HOLD

12:13.688 --> 12:15.622
TAYLOR GREENE RESPONSIBLE.
CONGRESSWOMAN WILLIAMS IS THE

12:15.722 --> 12:19.025
CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN
GEORGIA.

12:19.125 --> 12:22.327
SHE HOLDS JOHN LEWIS' SEAT IN
CONGRESS.

12:22.427 --> 12:27.530
YOU HAVE A REMARKABLE PERSONAL
STORY THAT YOUR GREAT AUNT WAS

12:27.630 --> 12:30.232
THE FIRST BLACK STUDENT TO
ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY OF

12:30.332 --> 12:30.866
ALABAMA.

12:31.433 --> 12:34.402
>> ANY AUNTIE INTEGRATED THE
UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA.

12:34.502 --> 12:37.871
GROWING UP, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
THE MAGNITUDE UNTIL MY NINTH

12:37.971 --> 12:41.207
GRADE ALABAMA HISTORY BOOK.
I WAS LIKE, MOM, AUNTIE IS IN MY

12:41.307 --> 12:46.944
HISTORY BOOK.
IT'S NOT LOST UPON ME THAT I

12:47.044 --> 12:50.880
HAVE THE LEGACY TO UPHOLD.
NO MATTER HOW FAR WE THINK WE

12:50.980 --> 12:53.982
HAVE GOTTEN, I THINK JANUARY 6th
SHOWED US HOW MUCH FARTHER WE

12:54.082 --> 12:59.452
STILL HAVE TO GO.

12:59.552 --> 13:01.019
>> YOU HAVE BEEN SWORN IN.

13:01.119 --> 13:04.388
>> JUST BEEN SWORN IN.
SPEAKING ON THE FLOOR TO DEFEND

13:04.488 --> 13:06.891
VOTING RIGHTS IN GEORGIA.
IN THE SEAT ONCE HELD BY JOHN

13:06.990 --> 13:11.460
LEWIS.
I REMEMBER HAVING A PHONE CALL

13:11.560 --> 13:17.231
LATER WITH MY COLLEAGUE.
WE WERE SAYING HOW IT WAS

13:17.331 --> 13:19.199
COMFORTING TO KNOW CONGRESSMAN
LEWIS DIDN'T HAVE TO WITNESS

13:19.299 --> 13:22.968
THIS.
BECAUSE TO KNOW EVERYTHING THAT

13:23.068 --> 13:26.570
HE HAD FOUGHT FOR FOR VOTING
RIGHTS, FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, HE

13:26.670 --> 13:30.073
WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE FLOOR
THAT DAY READY TO SPEAK TO

13:30.173 --> 13:32.741
DEFEND THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
VOTE FROM GEORGIA.

13:32.841 --> 13:35.743
SO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A TARGET.

13:35.843 --> 13:39.613
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?
DO YOU FEEL SAFE IN THE CAPITOL?

13:39.713 --> 13:41.814
>> I DON'T WALK ANYWHERE BY
MYSELF.

13:41.914 --> 13:45.717
IF I'M GOING TO THE FLOOR TO
VOTE, SOMEONE COMES WITH ME.

13:45.817 --> 13:53.922
INSIDE OF THE BUILDING,
INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL FORWAY.

13:54.022 --> 13:55.023
INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL FOR
UNDERWAY.

13:55.123 --> 13:57.491
I DON'T KNOW WHO I CAN TRUST
INSIDE OF THE BUILDING.

13:57.591 --> 14:01.094
>> THERE WILL BE A VOTE TOMORROW
TO STRIP MARJORY TAYLOR GREENE

14:01.194 --> 14:03.161
OF HER COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENT.

14:03.262 --> 14:07.698
>> I MEAN, SHE'S UNFIT TO SERVE
IN THE BODY.

14:07.798 --> 14:11.935
I WATCH THE CLIPS OF THE VIDEOS
OF HER MOCKING AND FOLLOWING

14:12.035 --> 14:15.271
STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IN SCHOOL
SHOOTINGS.

14:15.370 --> 14:19.273
>> I'M AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
I'M A GUN OWNER.

14:19.373 --> 14:21.841
YOU TRY TO TAKE AWAY MY SECOND
AMENDMENT RIGHT.

14:21.941 --> 14:25.377
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?
YOU CAN'T DEFEND YOUR STANCE?

14:25.477 --> 14:28.412
>> MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH
SCHOOL, WE HAD A SCHOOL

14:28.512 --> 14:31.648
SHOOTING.
MY CLASSMATE WAS KILLED IN THE

14:31.748 --> 14:35.484
PARKING LOT.
I KNOW THE PAIN THAT THOSE

14:35.584 --> 14:37.885
STUDENTS FELT AND THE FEAR THAT
THEY FELT.

14:37.985 --> 14:43.822
FOR HER TO MOCK THEM IS
APPALLING.

14:43.922 --> 14:49.693
SHE SHOULD NOT SERVE ON ANY
COMMITTEE, LET ALONE THE HOUSE

14:49.793 --> 14:50.327
EDUCATION COMMITTEE.

14:50.427 --> 14:52.562
>> WE HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

14:52.662 --> 14:57.599
>> WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO
SAY TO YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE

14:57.699 --> 15:00.167
HOUSE FLOOR, TO HER IF SHE'S
THERE?

15:00.267 --> 15:04.103
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST THING
THAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY IS THAT

15:04.203 --> 15:07.472
NOT MAKING THIS ABOUT
PARTISANSHIP.

15:07.572 --> 15:11.042
THIS IS ABOUT THE INSTITUTION OF
THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS.

15:11.142 --> 15:15.444
COMING INTO THAT BODY EVERY DAY,
SERVING THE PEOPLE OF THIS

15:15.544 --> 15:17.879
COUNTRY.
I MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH YOU ON A

15:17.979 --> 15:21.682
VOTE, BUT THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE
YOU FEEL UNSAFE.

15:21.782 --> 15:26.619
SHE LITERALLY SUPPORTED THE
NOTION THAT THERE SHOULD BE A

15:26.719 --> 15:33.656
BULLET PUT THROUGH THE HEAD OF
THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE.

15:33.756 --> 15:38.160
>> WE ARE MINUTES AWAY FROM THE
WEEKLY HOUSE REPUBLICAN

15:38.260 --> 15:40.895
CONFERENCE MEETING.
WE ARE WATCHING MEMBERS COME IN.

15:40.995 --> 15:44.097
>> IT'S EXPECTED TO BE A VERY
TENSE MEETING BEHIND CLOSED

15:44.197 --> 15:46.332
DOORS.
SHE MADE AN EFFORT.

15:46.432 --> 15:47.099
SHE HAS --

15:47.199 --> 15:49.167
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:49.267 --> 15:52.169
>> THEY ARE DEALING WITH A LOT
OF SHIT TODAY.

15:52.269 --> 15:55.938
>> THIS IS LIKE THE SHOOTOUT AT
THE OKAY CORRAL.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.607
THE OLD BUSH REPUBLICAN IN ME
HOPES -- I'M THINKING WITH MY

15:59.708 --> 16:01.408
HEART.
I HOPE THEY GET BEHIND CHENEY

16:01.508 --> 16:03.877
AND STICK IT TO TAYLOR GREENE.

16:03.977 --> 16:08.347
>> IDEOLOGICALLY, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU SHOULD BE ALIGNED WITH ONE

16:08.447 --> 16:12.650
OR THE OTHER.
McCARTHY STANDS WITH McCARTHY.

16:12.750 --> 16:16.486
HE IS FOCUSED ON NOT ONLY THE
PARTY BECOMING THE MAJORITY

16:16.585 --> 16:18.954
PARTY, BUT HE WANTS TO BE ITS
LEADER.

16:19.054 --> 16:21.923
HE WANTS TO BE SPEAKER.
HIS STANDING IN THE PARTY RIGHT

16:22.023 --> 16:27.927
NOW IS INCREDIBLY FRAGILE.

16:28.027 --> 16:30.895
>> THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE
DEMOCRATS NOW ARE BRANDING THE

16:30.995 --> 16:34.131
REPUBLICAN PARTY AS THE PARTY OF
Q.

16:34.231 --> 16:37.934
Q.
NANCY PELOSI PUT OUT A PRESS

16:38.034 --> 16:38.800
RELEASE TODAY.

16:38.900 --> 16:42.970
>> DEMOCRATS SMELL BLOOD IN THE
WATER.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.538
McCARTHY HAS THIS INCREDIBLY
DELICATE BALANCING ACT.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.040
HE GOES INTO THE CLOSED DOOR
SESSION AT A MOMENT WHEN

16:48.140 --> 16:52.944
EVERYTHING FOR THE PARTY IS UP
FOR GRABS.

16:53.044 --> 16:55.912
>> WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO YOUR
PARTY?

16:56.012 --> 16:57.513
WILL YOU APOLOGIZE?

16:57.613 --> 17:00.915
>> THEY ARE AT IT RIGHT NOW.
MEETING WHICH HAS BEEN

17:01.015 --> 17:05.152
TUMULTUOUS UNDERWAY.
WE NOW KNOW THAT THEY ARE

17:05.252 --> 17:06.019
VOTING.
THAT PROCESS IS BEGINNING RIGHT

17:06.120 --> 17:09.921
NOW.

17:10.021 --> 17:14.759
>> HERE IS OUR BREAKING NEWS.
LIST CHAIN

17:14.859 --> 17:17.227
LIST C
LIZ CHENEY HOLDING ONTO HER

17:17.327 --> 17:21.330
LEADERSHIP POST.
McCARTHY REFUSES TO STRIP

17:21.430 --> 17:23.131
ASSIGNMENTS FROM MARJORY TAYLOR
GREENE.

17:23.231 --> 17:27.200
>> TAYLOR GREENE SPOKE.
SHE RECEIVED A PARTIAL STANDING

17:27.300 --> 17:27.834
OVATION.

17:28.601 --> 17:31.903
>> IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF YOU
COULD HEAR WHAT SHE TOLD ALL OF

17:32.003 --> 17:33.171
US.
DENOUNCING QANON.

17:33.271 --> 17:37.007
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

17:37.107 --> 17:42.344
>> I REMAIN PROFOUNDLY CONCERNED
ABOUT HOUSE REPUBLICAN

17:42.444 --> 17:48.648
LEADERSHIP ACCEPTANCE OF EXTREME
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS.

17:48.748 --> 17:53.050
YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD HAVE
SOME SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO

17:53.151 --> 17:54.719
THIS INSTITUTION.

17:54.819 --> 17:58.588
>> HOUSE DEMOCRATS TODAY PLAN TO
STRIP MARJORY TAYLOR GREENE OF

17:58.688 --> 18:00.289
HER COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENT.

18:00.389 --> 18:03.358
>> WILL ANY REPUBLICANS JOIN
DEMOCRATS?

18:03.458 --> 18:06.326
>> ONE WAY CONGRESSWOMAN GREENE
COULD ALLEVIATE THIS SITUATION

18:06.427 --> 18:09.162
OR TRY TO IS TO SPEAK
PUBLICALLY.

18:09.262 --> 18:12.330
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE
GENTLE WOMAN FROM GEORGIA.

18:12.431 --> 18:16.300
>> I WAS ALLOWED TO BELIEVE
THINGS THAT WEREN'T TRUE.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.169
I WOULD ASK QUESTIONS AND TALK
ABOUT THEM.

18:19.269 --> 18:22.905
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT I
REGRET.

18:23.005 --> 18:27.674
BIG MEDIA COMPANIES CAN TAKE
TINY PIECES OF WORDS THAT I HAVE

18:27.774 --> 18:32.645
SAID, THAT YOU HAVE SAID, ANY OF
US AND CAN PORTRAY US INTO

18:32.745 --> 18:37.848
SOMEONE THAT WE ARE NOT.

18:37.948 --> 18:40.817
>> IT'S AN APOLOGY BUT IT'S NOT
REALLY AN APOLOGY.

18:40.917 --> 18:45.220
>> IT WAS, I WAS ALLOWED TO
BELIEVE THINGS AND THE MEDIA

18:45.320 --> 18:46.720
BEARS AS MUCH GUILT AS ANYONE
ELSE.

18:46.821 --> 18:49.823
THESE ARE DIRECT PLAYS FROM THE
TRUMP PLAYBOOK.

18:49.923 --> 18:52.758
>> YES.
BUT IT'S ALSO JUST THE SAME

18:52.858 --> 19:04.699
POLITICAL GARBAGE THAT I THINK
PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF ARE TIRED OF.

19:05.867 --> 19:09.203
>> DURING THE RACE, WERE YOU
AWARE THAT SHE HAD THIS HISTORY

19:09.303 --> 19:10.471
ON SOCIAL MEDIA?

19:10.571 --> 19:14.005
>> YOU KNOW, IT REALLY WASN'T
UNTIL WE GOT TO THE RUNOFF STAGE

19:14.105 --> 19:17.241
THAT I SORT OF LOOKED UNDER THE
HOOD A LITTLE MORE.

19:17.341 --> 19:19.543
THAT'S INTERESTING.
WOW.

19:19.643 --> 19:21.344
THAT'S PROBLEMATIC.

19:21.444 --> 19:24.279
>> DID YOU WARN OTHER REPUBLICAN
PARTY LEADERS ABOUT IT?

19:24.379 --> 19:25.447
HOW AWARE WERE THEY?

19:25.547 --> 19:27.849
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY WERE
AWARE.

19:27.949 --> 19:32.085
YOU ARE TAKING THE SAME TAG NOW
THAT, THAT'S IN HER PAST.

19:32.185 --> 19:34.653
SHE CAME IN WITH THE ENDORSEMENT
OF THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS,

19:34.753 --> 19:38.022
WHICH IS VERY POPULAR HERE IN
NORTHWEST GEORGIA.

19:38.122 --> 19:41.758
BY VIRTUE, SHE HAD TRUMP'S
BLESSING.

19:41.858 --> 19:43.993
SHE ADVERTISED WITH TRUMP.
SHE HAD TRUMP STAND UP

19:44.093 --> 19:48.629
SHE HAD TRUMP STAND -UP DOLLS
WITH HER.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.898
SHE DROVE A TRUMP BUS AROUND.
SHE GOT OFF TO THE RACES.

19:51.998 --> 19:55.234
>> YOU HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF
THE MOST OF THE PARTY

19:55.334 --> 19:57.602
LEADERSHIP.
THAT DIDN'T MATTER AS MUCH AS

19:57.702 --> 20:01.037
THIS FIRE AND BRIMSTONE THAT SHE
BROUGHT TO HER CANDIDACY.

20:01.137 --> 20:05.407
>> BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THAT
POINT, THE FOLKS IN NORTHWEST

20:05.508 --> 20:09.310
GEORGIA HAD SAID, SHE'S TRUMP'S
CHOSEN ONE, SHE'S TRUMP IN

20:09.410 --> 20:10.777
HEELS.
I HEARD THE WORD, WE WANT TO

20:10.878 --> 20:16.248
FIGHT HER PROBABLY MORE THAN I
HEARD WE WANT A THINKER.

20:16.348 --> 20:20.417
>> YOU SHOT A WATER MELON WITH
AN

20:24.387 --> 20:29.290
AN AR-15.

20:29.390 --> 20:34.094
>> MARJORY GREENE IS A FIGHTER
IN THE SENSE THAT SHE WILL THROW

20:34.194 --> 20:37.263
A PUNCH OUT OF LEFT FIELD.
IT MAY LAND ON HERSELF.

20:37.363 --> 20:39.097
IT MIGHT LAND ON A FRIEND.
IT MIGHT LAND ON THE ENEMY.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.164
I DON'T KNOW.

20:41.265 --> 20:42.132
>> SHE'S SWINGING?

20:42.232 --> 20:43.433
>> SHE'S SWINGING.

20:43.534 --> 20:47.302
>> IN AN HOUR, THE DEMOCRATS ARE
GOING TO FORCE A VOTE ON WHETHER

20:47.402 --> 20:50.771
OR NOT MARJORY TAYLOR GREENE CAN
KEEP HER COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.

20:50.871 --> 20:53.840
IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY ARE GOING
TO STRIP HER OF THEM.

20:53.940 --> 20:57.576
>> SHE'S PUT HER COLLEAGUES IN A
VERY BAD SITUATION.

20:57.676 --> 20:59.144
MAYBE THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT
HER.

20:59.244 --> 21:02.913
BUT THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO
VOTE FOR HER TO STAY ON THIS

21:03.013 --> 21:04.648
COMMITTEE.
THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY SAID, WE

21:04.748 --> 21:09.751
WILL PUT OUR STAMP OF APPROVAL
ON THIS PERSON WHO IS A BIT OF A

21:09.851 --> 21:12.286
WILD HORSE.
WHEN THEY COME UP FOR ELECTION,

21:12.386 --> 21:16.255
IF SHE DOESN'T -- IF SHE STEPS
OUT OF LINE, THEY WILL BE HUNG

21:16.355 --> 21:26.095
ON THAT VOTE.

21:26.195 --> 21:32.266
>> NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE
CONGRESS HAS A MAJORITY PARTY

21:32.366 --> 21:42.974
BEEN TAKEN SUCH IF A BEEN TAKEN
SUCH IFCRAZY ACTION.

21:43.073 --> 21:46.175
>> THIS DID NOT NEED TO HAPPEN.
REPUBLICANS COULD HAVE DEALT

21:46.275 --> 21:48.377
WITH THIS ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT
ANY VOTE ON THE FLOOR.

21:48.477 --> 21:51.913
THEY REFUSED TO DO SO.
THE REPUBLICANS DID THAT IN THE

21:52.013 --> 21:54.648
LAST CONGRESS.
THEY STRIPPED REPUBLICAN MEMBER

21:54.748 --> 22:00.052
STEVE KING OF HIS COMMITTEE
ASSIGNMENTS BECAUSE HE MADE

22:00.152 --> 22:03.187
RACIST COMMENTS.
THEY WON'T DO IT TO MARJORY

22:03.287 --> 22:05.055
TAYLOR GREENE BECAUSE TRUMP
BACKS HER.

22:05.155 --> 22:10.693
>> NEVER BEFORE IN THE HISTORY
OF THIS HOUSE HAS THE MAJORITY

22:10.793 --> 22:13.595
ABUSED ITS POWER IN THIS WAY.
NEVER.

22:13.695 --> 22:19.999
IF THIS IS THE NEW STANDARD, I
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUT

22:20.099 --> 22:20.799
THE STANDARD.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.200
>> MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE AISLE SAY THEY

22:22.300 --> 22:24.234
DISAPPROVE OF REPRESENTATIVE
GREENE'S ACTIONS.

22:24.335 --> 22:26.769
HOWEVER DISAPPROVAL WITHOUT
ACTION MEANS NOTHING.

22:26.869 --> 22:29.905
THIS IS ABOUT DOING WHAT'S
RIGHT.

22:30.005 --> 22:43.815
>> THEY ARE NOT THE SQUAD.
THEY ARE ALEXANDRIA, RASHIDA,

22:43.915 --> 22:46.416
THEY ARE PEOPLE, OUR COLLEAGUES.

22:46.516 --> 22:54.322
>> MEMBERS WILL RECORD THEIR
VOTE.

22:54.422 --> 23:06.430
>> ON THIS VOTE, THE YAY IS 230,
NEY IS 199.

23:06.530 --> 23:07.397
THE RESOLUTION IS OVER.

23:07.497 --> 23:11.567
>> IT'S OVER.
MARJORY TAYLOR GREENE WILL BE

23:11.667 --> 23:14.335
BARRED FROM SERVING ON THE
EDUCATION AND LABOR COMMITTEE AS

23:14.435 --> 23:21.340
WELL AS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE.

23:21.440 --> 23:25.577
>> THE HOUSE VOTE JUST
CONCLUDED, ALMOST ENTIRELY ALONG

23:25.676 --> 23:28.745
PARTY LINES, AS EXPECTED.
THERE WERE 11 HOUSE REPUBLICANS

23:28.845 --> 23:37.485
WHO VOTED WITH THE DEMOCRATS.
ONE OF THOSE WAS ADAM KINZINGER

23:37.585 --> 23:41.286
WHOSE PROMINENCE HAS BEEN
EXPANDED DRASTICALLY IN THE

23:41.387 --> 23:44.689
PERIOD OF TIME AFTER JANUARY 6th
WHEN HE WAS ONE OF THE HANDFUL

23:44.789 --> 23:48.225
OF REPUBLICANS TO VOTE TO
IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT AND THEN

23:48.325 --> 23:49.393
DID A VIDEO.

23:49.493 --> 23:52.028
>> REPUBLICANS MUST SAY ENOUGH
IS ENOUGH.

23:52.128 --> 23:56.031
IT'S TIME TO UNPLUG THE OUTRAGE
MACHINE AND CAST ASIDE THE

23:56.131 --> 23:59.066
CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND THE
RAGE.

23:59.166 --> 24:03.301
>> THAT PUTS HIM IN THE VANGUARD
OF REPUBLICANS WHO ARE TRYING TO

24:03.402 --> 24:06.937
RECLAIM THE VALUES AND IDEAS
THAT HAVE ANIMATED IT BACK IN IF

24:07.038 --> 24:11.274
THE OLD DAYS WHEN IT WAS KNOWN
AS THE PARTY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

24:11.374 --> 24:14.643
>> HERE IS THE THING,
CONGRESSMAN.

24:14.743 --> 24:18.079
IS IT NOT THE CASE THIS VOTE IS
A GIFT?

24:18.179 --> 24:21.014
IN THE END WHAT PEOPLE WILL
REPRESENT IS THE PARTY STOOD

24:21.114 --> 24:25.150
WITH MARJORY TAYLOR GREENE.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.552
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE TIGHT
AROUND OUR NECK.

24:27.652 --> 24:31.254
IT'S REALLY BAD.
I THINK IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT,

24:31.354 --> 24:34.723
THIS IS REALLY A GIFT TO YOU.
THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT WE SHOULD

24:34.823 --> 24:38.192
HAVE HAD THIS IN HOUSE, REMOVED
HER FROM HER COMMITTEES, NOT HAD

24:38.292 --> 24:39.393
A VOTE ON THE FLOOR.

24:39.493 --> 24:42.228
>> MANY PEOPLE SAY MARJORY
TAYLOR GREENE'S SPEECH WAS CLOSE

24:42.328 --> 24:43.696
TO WHAT SHE DID LAST NIGHT.

24:43.796 --> 24:45.264
>> IT WAS ALMOST IDENTICAL, I
WOULD SAY.

24:45.364 --> 24:50.367
>> A LOT OF YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE
SAYING, SHE'S CONTRITE, SHE

24:50.467 --> 24:51.601
APOLOGIZED.
I DIDN'T HEAR AN APOLOGY.

24:51.702 --> 24:55.504
>> THERE WAS NO APOLOGY.
IF THERE IS SOMETHING YOU ARE

24:55.604 --> 24:59.873
TRULY SORRY ABOUT AND YOU WANT
TO KIND OF START FRESH, YOU

24:59.973 --> 25:01.842
DON'T SPEND HALF OF YOUR SPEECH
TALKING ABOUT CANCEL CULTURE.

25:01.942 --> 25:05.143
RIGHT?
IT'S FRUSTRATING.

25:05.243 --> 25:08.146
SHE GOT A STANDING OVATION BY
HALF THE CAUCUS.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.747
>> IS THAT RIGHT?

25:09.847 --> 25:13.116
>> I DIDN'T DO A GOOD HEAD
COUNT.

25:13.216 --> 25:17.252
I WOULD SAY IT'S CLOSE TO THAT.
MEANWHILE, LIZ CHENEY VOTED HER

25:17.352 --> 25:19.787
CONSCIENCE.
IT WAS FOUR HOURS OF ATTACKING

25:19.887 --> 25:21.521
HER.
IT WAS REALLY A DIS

25:21.621 --> 25:29.360
IT WAS REALLY A DWEIRD WORLD.

25:29.461 --> 25:33.596
>> YOU VOTED FOR IMPEACHMENT.
YOU VOTED WITH DEMOCRATS TONIGHT

25:33.696 --> 25:37.099
ON MARJORY TAYLOR GREENE.
DOES THE CAUCUS HATE YOUR GUTS?

25:37.199 --> 25:44.137
>> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE KIND
OF RESPECT I'M SPEAKING OUT.

25:44.237 --> 25:47.372
THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE TELL ME,
WHY ARE YOU OUTSPOKEN?

25:47.473 --> 25:49.774
ISN'T YOUR BASE MAD?
YEAH.

25:49.874 --> 25:53.343
BUT I'M NOT A VIRTUAL
CONGRESSMAN THAT JUST RESPONDS

25:53.443 --> 25:57.279
TO WHAT INTERNET SAYS TO DO.
I SWORE TO THE CONSTITUTION.

25:57.379 --> 25:59.948
THAT COMES WITH A SPECIAL SET OF
REQUIREMENTS TO LEAD PEOPLE TO A

26:00.048 --> 26:04.484
BRIGHTER FUTURE.
MY PRESCRIPTIONS MAY BE WRONG.

26:04.584 --> 26:06.586
THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

26:06.686 --> 26:11.088
>> THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT THE
PARTY OF LINCOLN, THE IMAGE, THE

26:11.188 --> 26:15.892
HISTORY OF IT AND WHAT IT IS NOW
IS SO VAST, IT FEELS LIKE.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.860
IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET BACK TO
THAT?

26:17.960 --> 26:20.495
>> TOTALLY.
I THINK WE NEVER THOUGHT WE

26:20.595 --> 26:26.398
WOULD GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE
WOULD BE THE PARTY OF TRUMP.

26:26.499 --> 26:29.367
YOU CAN ENCOURAGE PEOPLE'S
BETTER ANGELS.

26:29.467 --> 26:30.635
I THINK THAT WILL CATCH.

26:30.735 --> 26:34.638
>> LAST WEEK, FORMER CONGRESSMAN
JOE WALSH PUT OUT A TWEET.

26:34.738 --> 26:44.611
TODAY'S REPUBLICAN PARTY IS
WAY --

26:44.711 --> 26:49.181
>> IT'S NOT CLOSE.
IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

26:49.281 --> 26:50.149
IS HE WRONG?

26:50.582 --> 26:53.384
>> I DON'T THINK HE IS WRONG.
I THINK THE THING IS, WE KIND OF

26:53.484 --> 26:57.219
HAVE THIS SENSE OF A FAIT
ACCOMPLI.

26:57.319 --> 27:00.588
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.
I THINK THIS IS WHY IT'S

27:00.688 --> 27:01.689
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO SPEAK
OUT.

27:01.790 --> 27:06.360
I MAY FAIL AT THIS.
PROBABLY COULD FAIL.

27:06.459 --> 27:07.493
OKAY.
I'M AT PEACE.

27:07.593 --> 27:12.164
AS LONG AS I GAVE IT A HUGE
EFFORT TO TRY TO SAVE IT.

27:12.264 --> 27:17.000
>> THERE'S A LOST COST QUALITY.
DOES THIS FEEL LIKE A SUICIDE

27:17.100 --> 27:17.801
MISSION?

27:18.001 --> 27:21.904
>> IT DOES.
I'M NOT HERE TO BE A HERO.

27:22.003 --> 27:24.772
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GOT
MEDALS OF HONOR ON WHAT THEY

27:24.939 --> 27:25.038
THOUGHT

27:25.038 --> 27:25.172
THOUGHT WERE

27:25.172 --> 27:50.288
THOUGHT WERE SUICIDE
