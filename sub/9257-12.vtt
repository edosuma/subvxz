00:15.615 --> 00:17.916
<i>Oh, God.</i>

00:30.442 --> 00:35.106
<i>Well, I can't say the content of
this report comes as a surprise.</i>

00:35.146 --> 00:37.314
<i>The changes around here
can't just be cosmetic.</i>

00:37.354 --> 00:38.986
<i>I agree.</i>

00:39.020 --> 00:41.986
<i>On top of this mess, we have
a budget cut. No more O.T.</i>

00:42.026 --> 00:44.802
<i>–What about a pay freeze?
–Done. Even the pension is taking a hit.</i>

00:44.842 --> 00:48.355
–Ayear longer to qualify, less in benefits.
–Jesus.

00:48.618 --> 00:50.914
You think I like doing this
my first month on the job?

00:50.954 --> 00:55.083
This squad is going to have to
cut its work force by 20%.

00:55.116 --> 00:59.714
20%? How are we supposed to maintain our
arrest numbers with a depleted force?

00:59.754 --> 01:02.372
<i>We have to find a way.</i>

01:02.570 --> 01:05.346
Start with the disciplinary cases
and the retirement phase-outs.

01:05.385 --> 01:08.802
Then fire whoever
you have to to get to 20%.

01:08.874 --> 01:11.940
–You want me to choose who goes?
–You're the C.O. You know them best.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.882
You want the blood on my hands,
not yours. I won't do it.

01:14.922 --> 01:17.922
<i>–Yes, you will.
–Why should I?</i>

01:18.058 --> 01:20.482
<i>I'm on borrowed time here as it is.</i>

01:20.522 --> 01:22.434
You can't afford to lose your job…

01:22.474 --> 01:24.645
the day before a close election.

01:24.843 --> 01:28.388
For the moment,
you are still my employee.

01:28.426 --> 01:31.924
<i>I want the list of who's gone
by this evening.</i>

01:39.498 --> 01:42.945
–Tomas.
–Julien. Thanks for coming.

01:43.114 --> 01:47.042
<i>–This is Gary, my sponsor.
–I help with Julien's reorientation therapy.</i>

01:47.082 --> 01:50.146
<i>Look, I came to tell you
to stop calling me.</i>

01:50.186 --> 01:52.354
There's no room
in my life for you.

01:52.394 --> 01:55.684
You gotta be kidding me. And you brought
him along as muscle?

01:55.724 --> 01:58.210
<i>Look, Julien's made his intent
with you very clear.</i>

01:58.250 --> 02:00.578
Any further contact
is only gonna damage you both.

02:00.618 --> 02:03.330
<i>Listen, I got no place to stay.
I got no money.</i>

02:03.370 --> 02:06.530
<i>–Shelters can help you.
–Stop trying to keep yourself
connected. It's over.</i>

02:06.570 --> 02:09.314
–You stay out of this!
–Tomas, I am married now. I have a son.

02:09.354 --> 02:11.298
My life has to be
about them and God.

02:11.338 --> 02:13.763
You fags can hide
behind Jesus all you want…

02:13.803 --> 02:15.683
but you're not
fooling anybody.

02:15.723 --> 02:17.730
That's enough.
You've been warned.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.466
<i>Gary!</i>

02:19.499 --> 02:22.403
<i>–My eye!
–What's going on over there?</i>

02:25.066 --> 02:28.132
Look up, look, up, look up.
Oh, God.

02:28.266 --> 02:30.178
All right, all right, all right.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.898
<i>There's a full five paragraphs
in the report…</i>

02:32.938 --> 02:34.662
on the Bob and Marcy case.

02:34.858 --> 02:36.738
Well, it wasn't our finest hour.

02:36.778 --> 02:38.532
<i>I appreciate you
including yourself…</i>

02:38.572 --> 02:41.412
but everybody knows it was me who let the
suspects go with the victim in their trunk.

02:41.452 --> 02:45.808
<i>Jeffrey Cole, 14. Been missing since
as late as last night.</i>

02:46.410 --> 02:49.506
–Are you the parents?
–He's the father, but I'm the parent.

02:49.546 --> 02:52.611
–Don't be like that.
–This wouldn't have happened
if he was still with me.

02:52.651 --> 02:55.874
–When was the last time you saw Jeffrey?
–Last night when I left for work.

02:55.914 --> 02:59.970
When I got back, I didn't want to wake
him. I shoulda checked on him earlier.

03:00.010 --> 03:03.779
I live in Venice. I called everyone
we know there. Nothing!

03:03.819 --> 03:07.810
<i>We'll need a recent picture so the officers
can pass it around to everyone in the area.</i>

03:07.850 --> 03:10.556
–Maybe someone's seen him.
–There you go.

03:10.570 --> 03:13.144
Oh, God. If anything's
happened to him…

03:13.323 --> 03:15.461
I'll never forgive myself.

03:17.226 --> 03:19.682
–The money train's moving up?
–We don't know…

03:19.722 --> 03:22.370
but the ship the Armenians use to get the
money out of the country hits port tonight.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.834
–It's not due for two weeks.
–According to the manifest…

03:24.874 --> 03:27.394
it's scheduled to
ship out in two days.

03:27.434 --> 03:29.730
The Armenians can't be onto us.
We've been careful.

03:29.770 --> 03:31.490
Maybe they're just
changing things up…

03:31.530 --> 03:33.412
<i>–just trying to avoid a routine.
–Goddamn it.</i>

03:33.452 --> 03:37.214
There's no room for last-minute
surprises. This kills us.

03:37.323 --> 03:40.066
<i>–We can't just walk away
from the money train.
–Look, I know you need this.</i>

03:40.106 --> 03:42.402
<i>–We all do!
–But I'm not takin' any chances.</i>

03:42.442 --> 03:46.178
<i>At least let Ronnie and me try
to find out where they might be
moving the money train to.</i>

03:46.218 --> 03:48.868
<i>Let's not give up yet.</i>

03:49.066 --> 03:50.789
All right.

03:50.986 --> 03:54.286
But if this thing's
not rock solid, we're bailin'.

03:59.403 --> 04:02.818
–What's your name?
–Kandle. You can light me
up at both ends.

04:02.858 --> 04:06.600
<i>Have you seen this boy
in the past 24 hours?</i>

04:06.794 --> 04:10.787
–Sorry, sister.
–Thanks.

04:10.986 --> 04:13.155
I haven't read the report yet, but I
hear there's a whole paragraph…

04:13.195 --> 04:16.002
on Armadillo getting stabbed
to death in the cage.

04:16.041 --> 04:18.209
I saw you frisk him.
He got that knife some other way.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.834
Yeah. Tell that
to the bosses. Sir.

04:21.034 --> 04:25.034
Excuse me, sir. Have you
seen this boy recently?

04:25.067 --> 04:28.499
Last night. Walking around.
He seemed a little lost.

04:28.554 --> 04:31.586
–Sure it was him?
–He stood out from the sickos.

04:31.626 --> 04:34.306
–Did you see which way he went?
–He got into a car.

04:34.346 --> 04:36.066
<i>On his own, or was he forced in?</i>

04:36.106 --> 04:38.946
I was running somebody's credit card,
and I looked up…

04:38.986 --> 04:40.930
and the car drove off
with him in it.

04:40.970 --> 04:42.466
What kind of car was it, sir?

04:42.506 --> 04:44.804
<i>Jeffrey attended school in Venice.</i>

04:44.844 --> 04:47.714
Dad lives here, wanted to take
his son in for a year.

04:47.754 --> 04:51.042
Mom reluctantly agreed. Kid's only been
in Farmington for two months.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.898
Hasn't really made
too many friends.

04:52.938 --> 04:56.834
<i>–What's that got to do
with him hitching a ride?
–Fits the profile.</i>

04:56.874 --> 05:00.418
Isolated, alienated,
vulnerable. He's the perfect
candidate to be taken by an adult aggressor.

05:00.458 --> 05:04.648
Two kids were snatched in that area
three months ago.

05:04.746 --> 05:08.746
Both taken at different times,
bodies found weeks apart.

05:08.780 --> 05:11.522
These are the two kids who were
duct-taped and shot in the face?

05:11.562 --> 05:14.370
Yeah. One 12, the other 13.
Both sexually assaulted and tortured.

05:14.410 --> 05:17.954
That's Brent's case. Talk to him. See if
there's anything else pertinent in his file.

05:17.994 --> 05:21.378
We may only have a couple of hours.
Kid may already be dead.

05:21.418 --> 05:24.258
I hate to say it, but our best
hope is that this deviant's…

05:24.298 --> 05:26.659
got the boy chained up to a fence
somewhere, loves his ass so much…

05:26.699 --> 05:29.250
–can't give it up for a few days.
–That's my son, asshole!

05:29.290 --> 05:31.973
Hey, hey, hey! Get off him!

05:32.170 --> 05:35.617
<i>Get off him!</i>

05:35.786 --> 05:38.916
That's my son he's talking about!
He's talking about Jeffrey!

05:38.956 --> 05:42.434
Goddamn it, stop it! It was a stupid
thing to say. Now calm down!

05:42.474 --> 05:44.866
We're the ones that are
trying to help you, okay?

05:44.906 --> 05:49.922
The only thing that's important right
now is finding your boy, right? Right?

05:49.994 --> 05:54.402
Come on.
Let's go talk about it.

06:08.074 --> 06:09.956
The idea of some monster and my boy.

06:09.996 --> 06:12.194
We don't know yet
if that's what's happened.

06:12.234 --> 06:14.466
Well, that's what that
goddamn detective said.

06:14.506 --> 06:17.826
Look, Dutch-boy's people skills might not be
first-rate, but his detective work is.

06:17.866 --> 06:20.962
<i>He doesn't want to know my son.
Jeffrey's a good kid.</i>

06:21.002 --> 06:23.170
He's been through a lot of things,
but he's a good kid.

06:23.210 --> 06:26.466
We're gonna do everything
we can to get him back to you.

06:26.506 --> 06:30.630
–You too?
–Yeah. Me too.

06:32.682 --> 06:34.406
How's the dad doing?

06:34.474 --> 06:37.256
He'd be a lot better
if we found his kid.

06:37.290 --> 06:41.762
–Look, this pedophilia
thing's not my strong suit.
–I can run with it.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.994
Nah. If it's all the same
to you, I'd like to lend a hand.

06:45.034 --> 06:47.434
Just tell me how to help.

06:47.468 --> 06:52.154
Okay. Well, um, the first two victims
suffered sadistic torture ritual.

06:52.298 --> 06:54.466
<i>That stuff usually starts
at the fantasy level.</i>

06:54.506 --> 06:56.450
What, fantasy, as in kid flicks?

06:56.490 --> 06:59.394
All three abductions took place
in the same neighborhood.
If the guy gets his victims there…

06:59.434 --> 07:01.060
<i>maybe he gets
his porn there too.</i>

07:01.100 --> 07:04.706
Vic and I'll run the smut shops, get names of
the K.Y cowboys who prefer to ride ponies.

07:04.746 --> 07:09.218
<i>It won't be easy getting names from
a sex shop. Uh, privacy issues involved.</i>

07:09.258 --> 07:11.909
Maybe we can get around it.

07:13.098 --> 07:15.402
<i>Learn anything new?</i>

07:15.435 --> 07:18.730
I, uh, checked Brent's
files, ran the names…

07:18.763 --> 07:22.210
of all the sex offenders who live in the
neighborhood where the boys were abducted.

07:22.250 --> 07:26.084
–So did Brent. He didn't find anything.
–He didn't follow up.

07:26.124 --> 07:28.194
A convicted child molester
lives in the neighborhood.

07:28.234 --> 07:31.330
He just didn't register until after the
investigation. Our guys talked to him.

07:31.370 --> 07:33.825
They didn't know
the connection.

07:33.962 --> 07:36.034
Get Brent's files,
consolidate the two cases…

07:36.074 --> 07:39.242
–and the two of you take the point.
–You got it.

07:39.402 --> 07:41.258
<i>Detective Wyms.</i>

07:41.292 --> 07:44.130
A pleasure to meet you.
I'm Chief Bankston.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.438
Yes, I know.

07:46.602 --> 07:49.570
My tour is done.
Would you mind walking me out?

07:49.610 --> 07:51.398
Sure.

07:54.603 --> 07:56.319
I read Ms Kellis's report.

07:56.362 --> 07:57.891
I haven't had a chance yet.

07:57.931 --> 08:01.122
Well, she thinks you're
the best candidate to run this place.

08:01.162 --> 08:02.787
That's a bit of an exaggeration.

08:02.827 --> 08:07.049
–How do you think things are here?
–The barn has problems…

08:07.466 --> 08:10.146
as deep as the report
indicates, but not as wide.

08:10.186 --> 08:12.837
–Meaning?
–I'd rather not elaborate.

08:13.034 --> 08:17.442
–So, about the job, then.
–I'm a detective, not a leader.

08:17.643 --> 08:20.085
I do my work.
I go home. I like that.

08:24.458 --> 08:26.179
Hey. We got
a missing kid, huh?

08:26.219 --> 08:29.442
Yeah. Shane and I are running the
skin shops. I want you over in Venice.

08:29.482 --> 08:31.746
–All right. What's there?
–The mom.

08:31.786 --> 08:34.562
Find out who the kid's hangin' with.
See what they know about him.

08:34.602 --> 08:37.253
Me and Ronnie'll
stay on the money tr…

08:37.450 --> 08:39.424
Money what?

08:39.466 --> 08:42.306
–Money, uh… Money trail, right?
–Yeah, right.

08:42.346 --> 08:44.874
<i>Yeah.
That's what the, uh…</i>

08:44.908 --> 08:48.354
Find out if the kid was using the dad's
credit or check cards, right?

08:48.394 --> 08:50.274
<i>–Yeah.
–All right. Let's get going. Come on.</i>

08:50.314 --> 08:52.289
Let's go, Ronnie.

08:58.762 --> 09:00.453
Hi.

09:00.650 --> 09:02.821
<i>All right, man. See ya.</i>

09:05.066 --> 09:08.162
–“Me and Ronnie'll look
after the money train”?
–I stopped before I said it.

09:08.202 --> 09:11.106
–Not before Tavon smelled it.
–I forgot. Tavon feels like one of us.

09:11.146 --> 09:12.611
Yeah, well, he isn't one of us.

09:12.651 --> 09:15.330
–We don't know who this guy
is yet, you understand?
–All right. I'm sorry.

09:15.370 --> 09:17.730
You two are on edge about this
entire thing, and you pull that shit.

09:17.770 --> 09:22.258
You know what? I screwed up.
Like it's never happened to you before?

09:24.714 --> 09:27.714
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.

09:30.282 --> 09:34.018
Hey, Julien, man, we just responded to
an assault victim at Mission Cross.

09:34.058 --> 09:37.538
<i>–Gary. I dropped him off.
–Poor guy's vision's blurry.
They say it may be permanent.</i>

09:37.578 --> 09:39.330
<i>–Really?
–Yeah. And he said the guy who did it…</i>

09:39.370 --> 09:44.980
was wearing a ring or something and screwed
up his eye, and he didn't see who did it.

09:45.706 --> 09:47.714
–Um, I… I saw him.
–What?

09:47.883 --> 09:50.698
Who hit him.
His name is Tomas Motyashik.

09:50.732 --> 09:54.408
<i>–He's on parole.
–Okay. We'll pick him up.</i>

09:55.082 --> 09:57.635
Thanks.

09:57.834 --> 09:59.874
What did Tomas do this time?

10:00.010 --> 10:02.344
He went too far.

10:07.562 --> 10:10.928
<i>–Get out.
–Hey, hey, hey. You got a warrant?</i>

10:13.034 --> 10:16.834
I just busted a couple of guys cruising, asked
them where they got their jerk-off material.

10:16.874 --> 10:20.514
–Well, it's still legal to sell pornography.
–They said you got a back room.

10:20.554 --> 10:23.394
–How many back doors you got around here?
–I see one.

10:23.434 --> 10:25.158
I want to see the warrant.

10:25.290 --> 10:28.920
I'm not goin' anywhere
your regular customers don't go.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.964
–Hey. What's in here?
–This is all legal.

10:36.938 --> 10:39.554
<i>–Child bondage films.
–No minors were used.</i>

10:39.594 --> 10:42.468
<i>The faces were just digitally morphed
to make 'em look like kids.</i>

10:42.508 --> 10:45.122
–Yeah, hooray for Hollywood.
–Well, you may not like it…

10:45.162 --> 10:47.620
but the Supreme Court says it's cool,
'cause no real kids got hurt.

10:47.660 --> 10:49.890
Until some asshole watches this
and gets some ideas.

10:49.930 --> 10:52.264
Technically, you're out of luck.

10:52.426 --> 10:56.132
Yeah, well, technically, I see about
a dozen fire-code violations in here.

10:56.172 --> 10:58.658
I'm gonna need a list
of your more deviant clients.

10:58.698 --> 11:02.370
–Want me to call and get the
fire marshal on the horn?
–No, that won't be necessary.

11:02.410 --> 11:04.198
Will it?

11:06.154 --> 11:07.877
He looks very sweet.

11:08.042 --> 11:12.036
<i>We have a witness who saw Jeffrey get
into your car around 9:30 last night.</i>

11:12.076 --> 11:15.746
–How do you explain that?
–You better get yourself a better eyewitness.

11:15.786 --> 11:18.626
<i>–Why is that?
–I was at dinner at 9:30.</i>

11:18.666 --> 11:20.976
<i>–With whom?
–A group of, uh…</i>

11:21.003 --> 11:23.588
like-minded individuals.

11:23.786 --> 11:26.819
We talked about boys…

11:26.954 --> 11:29.058
but we didn't have any for dessert.

11:29.098 --> 11:31.138
You're not funny.

11:31.274 --> 11:34.208
You're a monster.

11:34.346 --> 11:37.826
Men who kill and torture
are monsters.

11:38.026 --> 11:39.587
Not me.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.721
<i>You're a registered sex offender.</i>

11:42.858 --> 11:44.581
You molest children.

11:44.778 --> 11:46.692
I have never molested a child.

11:46.732 --> 11:49.538
I have only shared experiences
with those that give consent…

11:49.578 --> 11:52.545
with those that yearn
to experience life.

11:52.938 --> 11:55.970
<i>These boys are flowers
looking to bloom.</i>

11:56.010 --> 11:57.730
I am their sun and their water.

11:57.770 --> 11:59.875
Right.

12:03.082 --> 12:06.818
This guy didn't do it. Makes my
stomach crawl, but he didn't do it.

12:06.858 --> 12:10.466
I know. A 15-year-old named
Lydell Crouch was just abducted
from the same neighborhood.

12:10.506 --> 12:12.775
Oh, Jesus.
Anyone see who did it?

12:12.874 --> 12:16.103
No. It was in his house.
Window was broken.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.563
–Kid's just missing.
–Wait a minute.

12:18.603 --> 12:20.450
Maybe our predator's pathology…

12:20.490 --> 12:23.170
is to abduct multiple boys
simultaneously.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.914
–I don't want to hear this.
–In Brent's case, the first two
were killed at the same time.

12:26.954 --> 12:30.626
Maybe our predator needs a voyeuristic
component to fulfill his fantasy…

12:30.666 --> 12:35.554
forces them to interact sexually
or maybe molests one while
forcing the other one to watch.

12:35.594 --> 12:38.882
The point is, if he needs
them both alive to get off…

12:38.922 --> 12:42.288
there's a good chance
he hasn't killed Jeffrey yet.

12:43.114 --> 12:45.538
Okay, thanks. Keep working
on the other friends.

12:45.578 --> 12:48.770
–I'll run this freak list
against the DMV. records.
–Good.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.014
You found anything yet?

12:53.418 --> 12:56.194
–We're working on some good leads.
–What does that mean?

12:56.234 --> 12:59.458
It means you're gonna have to trust me.
I'm doing everything I can.

12:59.498 --> 13:01.450
Okay.

13:01.483 --> 13:04.290
Um, one of my men spoke to one of
Jeffrey's friends over in Venice.

13:04.330 --> 13:07.778
<i>He said that Jeff's been depressed
lately. Is that true?</i>

13:07.818 --> 13:09.610
I guess.

13:09.644 --> 13:12.548
I just thought he was
going through a phase.

13:12.554 --> 13:15.876
<i>I mean, he's a teenager. I missed
so much of his life after the divorce.</i>

13:15.916 --> 13:17.796
<i>I just thought he was
acting out, you know?</i>

13:17.836 --> 13:21.506
<i>You think he ran away and got in a car
with somebody he shouldn't have?</i>

13:21.546 --> 13:24.322
<i>If he did run away, you have any idea
where he may have gone?</i>

13:24.362 --> 13:26.566
To his mom's.

13:26.763 --> 13:30.723
I mean, she's the only one
that's really been there for him.

13:33.642 --> 13:37.319
Julien, Julien! Come here.

13:37.482 --> 13:41.442
<i>Don't turn your back on me.
Not after all we've had together.</i>

13:41.482 --> 13:45.191
Oh, you got laid. Now you want to
just ignore me? Huh?

13:46.314 --> 13:49.250
–That's right. I was his lover!
–Shut up! Now!

13:49.290 --> 13:52.898
You loved me. Every night for a month.
You still love me!

13:52.938 --> 13:56.036
You know what?
You can cool off upstairs.

13:56.298 --> 13:58.498
–We did everything. Everything!
–Stop it!

13:58.538 --> 14:01.026
–And now you won't help me?
–You got yourself in trouble.

14:01.066 --> 14:04.482
–I didn't have anything to do with it.
–You can't admit who you are!

14:04.522 --> 14:06.723
<i>–Leave him alone!
–Your dick in my ass means you're gay.</i>

14:06.763 --> 14:10.987
<i>–Shut up!
–My dick in your mouth
means you're really gay!</i>

14:40.874 --> 14:42.663
You okay?

14:50.954 --> 14:53.892
Corrine subpoenaed your police jacket
and financial records…

14:53.932 --> 14:56.738
froze your joint savings,
emptied your checking account.

14:56.778 --> 15:00.642
Now, in my experience, no one goes
straight to DEFCON 5 the way she did…

15:00.682 --> 15:02.471
without a reason.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.362
The other night
when you served her the papers…

15:07.402 --> 15:09.574
she came over
to my apartment.

15:11.242 --> 15:13.893
You weren't alone?

15:14.090 --> 15:16.418
You know this makes my job
a lot tougher, right?

15:16.458 --> 15:19.298
Look, you gotta protect
my rights with my kids.

15:19.338 --> 15:21.794
<i>–That's the only thing that matters.
–I'll do the best I can…</i>

15:21.834 --> 15:25.992
but screwing some broad
and getting caught isn't going to help.

15:27.082 --> 15:30.498
Look, I'm supposed to go over and see Cassidy
and help her with a science project.

15:30.538 --> 15:34.762
If you had a predetermined
time to be with your kid, honor that.

15:46.058 --> 15:48.709
Corrine?

15:51.306 --> 15:53.666
Aw, come on, Corrine!
I know you're home!

15:53.706 --> 15:57.318
<i>You're such a good girl.</i>

15:57.514 --> 15:59.303
Corrine!

16:07.178 --> 16:09.731
Matthew! Matthew!

16:17.130 --> 16:21.222
You know what? Wait here
and keep an eye on your sister, okay?

16:28.810 --> 16:31.527
Shit!

16:33.194 --> 16:34.986
Corrine, what's the code?

16:35.019 --> 16:37.570
–What are you doing here?
–Matthew was screaming.

16:37.610 --> 16:40.683
<i>Great!</i>

16:40.716 --> 16:44.610
<i>–God. You broke the window?
–You changed the goddamn locks!</i>

16:44.650 --> 16:47.266
–To keep you out!
–It's my house!
–Not anymore.

16:47.306 --> 16:49.610
I came here to see Cassidy.

16:49.644 --> 16:51.906
You'll have to go through my lawyer
to set up a time from now on!

16:51.946 --> 16:54.946
I'm not gonna schedule time with
your lawyer to see my children!

16:54.986 --> 16:57.032
Then you're not gonna see them!

16:57.130 --> 16:59.367
Megan!

17:01.642 --> 17:05.667
–I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
–It's okay, Cassidy. Is she all right?

17:05.770 --> 17:09.069
–No. It's scalding water!
–Let me see. Let me see.

17:11.723 --> 17:14.818
She just got splashed.
She just got a little scared.

17:14.858 --> 17:16.516
Just go!

17:16.714 --> 17:19.233
<i>Now!</i>

17:26.473 --> 17:29.769
Hello? Yeah, uh, the code?

17:29.930 --> 17:31.654
“Little man”?

17:31.850 --> 17:33.989
Yeah. No, we're okay. Thank you.

17:44.746 --> 17:46.535
<i>Matt?</i>

17:48.746 --> 17:50.469
You okay, little man?

17:50.666 --> 17:52.389
Come on.

17:52.586 --> 17:55.652
Okay. Okay.
Come here. Come here.

18:05.578 --> 18:10.051
–Yes?
–Chief offer you my job?

18:12.650 --> 18:14.951
Yes. I wasn't interested.

18:15.050 --> 18:18.306
–Why not?
–Because I really don't
want to be you right now.

18:18.346 --> 18:20.706
<i>Hey, we think we've found a poss…</i>

18:20.746 --> 18:23.113
Where have you been the last hour?

18:23.210 --> 18:25.218
–Taking care of some personal stuff.
–Do it on your own time.

18:25.258 --> 18:28.682
You're either on this case
or you're not.

18:28.716 --> 18:32.162
Shane cross-checked the kiddie porn
client list with the DMV.

18:32.202 --> 18:33.986
We might have found
a possible match to the car.

18:34.026 --> 18:36.970
–Might have?
–The same general description.

18:37.004 --> 18:39.586
And his X-rated interests
are a match for our predator.

18:39.626 --> 18:42.882
–That's not enough to satisfy a judge.
–It satisfies me.

18:42.922 --> 18:46.210
Look, one of us better start getting creative
while this kid's still breathing.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.794
<i>Which won't be much longer if he follows
the same M.O as his previous victims.</i>

18:49.834 --> 18:52.226
<i>He killed both kids
within 30 hours of abduction.</i>

18:52.266 --> 18:54.530
Go around the warrant for now.
Pick him up on the street…

18:54.570 --> 18:56.480
just for questioning.

18:56.618 --> 18:58.985
I'll use kid gloves.

19:30.858 --> 19:33.443
–That's okay, Adam. We'll drive.
–What'd I do?

19:33.483 --> 19:36.034
<i>–Two 14 year olds.
–Where'd you get the shiner?</i>

19:36.074 --> 19:39.238
One of'em fight back,
you sick prick?

19:39.370 --> 19:42.275
–I didn't do anything.
–This used to be a church, man.

19:42.315 --> 19:47.397
–If you lie in here, you're
going straight to hell.
–He's going there anyway.

19:49.418 --> 19:51.426
Is that the guy?
Is that the one who…

19:51.466 --> 19:54.304
Hey, hey. That's what
we're gonna find out.

20:00.298 --> 20:03.527
I'm on this for you.

20:03.690 --> 20:05.858
<i>You stay here. You stay calm.</i>

20:05.898 --> 20:09.247
<i>It's okay. Just go in there
and sit down.</i>

20:12.394 --> 20:17.026
We have a witness who saw Jeffrey Cole
getting into your car yesterday on Doverson.

20:17.066 --> 20:19.690
I've never seen him before. Sorry.

20:19.724 --> 20:23.266
<i>–He barely looked. He's lying.
–You didn't even bother
to look at the photo.</i>

20:23.306 --> 20:26.306
What about Lydell?
Did he fight back?

20:27.722 --> 20:30.146
He give you that black eye
when you abducted him?

20:30.186 --> 20:33.700
<i>–I didn't abduct anyone.
–So they went along willingly.</i>

20:33.740 --> 20:36.803
Okay, that's not kidnapping.
That might help you.

20:36.843 --> 20:38.850
<i>We're dusting your car
for their prints.</i>

20:38.890 --> 20:40.962
If either of theirs turn up,
we'll know you're lying.

20:41.002 --> 20:43.490
You know, I was told that you just
wanted to ask some questions.

20:43.530 --> 20:48.942
Now, if you want to start treating me like
a suspect, I want to talk to my lawyer.

20:51.050 --> 20:55.170
–You don't have a thing on him.
–Lawyering up this fast, we know he's lying.

20:55.210 --> 20:59.717
Captain, patrol just found a body.
Looks like one of our kids.

20:59.914 --> 21:04.006
<i>–Over there.
–Mark it. Make sure
they pick it up later.</i>

21:07.146 --> 21:09.863
It's Lydell, our second missing kid.

21:10.058 --> 21:12.388
Looks like two shots,
back of the head.

21:12.428 --> 21:15.972
Be a while before the ME.
Can determine sexual abuse.

21:16.266 --> 21:18.370
Maybe Adam had Jeffrey
shoot Lydell…

21:18.410 --> 21:20.994
his own twisted snuff film,
only without the film.

21:21.034 --> 21:23.716
–Where do you get this stuff from?
–Hey, it happens.

21:23.756 --> 21:27.848
<i>–At least we got the creep in custody.
–For the moment.</i>

21:28.714 --> 21:31.618
–I don't like talking about this now.
–This is important.

21:31.658 --> 21:34.658
–What?
–They cleared out the money
location, moved everything out.

21:34.698 --> 21:37.251
That's it, then. We're out.

21:37.450 --> 21:39.236
–Hold on.
–I hacked into the port computer.

21:39.276 --> 21:41.986
The Armenians reserved a container with
a bigger break point than before.

21:42.026 --> 21:45.346
–That means more money.
This thing is a gold mine.
–I just said we're out.

21:45.386 --> 21:48.034
<i>The company they're running the
shipment through filed for Chapter 11.</i>

21:48.074 --> 21:51.042
After this shipment, they're closing the
money train, moving it someplace else.

21:51.082 --> 21:53.442
–Seattle, Frisco, who knows?
–And we're only gonna get one shot at this.

21:53.482 --> 21:58.054
So we gotta take it. We have to
come up with a new plan right now.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.584
Look, I'm done
talking about this.

22:06.090 --> 22:08.963
<i>I set up a series
of important rallies for you.</i>

22:09.003 --> 22:12.290
<i>–You were supposed to be there.
–I'm sorry. I sent Aurora.</i>

22:12.330 --> 22:14.626
<i>I am financing you
in this election, David.</i>

22:14.666 --> 22:16.389
<i>Not your wife!</i>

22:16.586 --> 22:18.786
I have a very important case here.
I can't get away.

22:18.826 --> 22:20.740
I need you to get
out on the streets…

22:20.780 --> 22:24.608
and try to win every vote you can get,
especially now.

22:24.938 --> 22:27.426
I have three dead children
and a missing one.

22:27.466 --> 22:30.019
I'm overseeing
the investigation.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.914
That takes precedent…

22:31.948 --> 22:34.274
over scrambling
for a few hundred votes.

22:34.314 --> 22:37.538
<i>A few hundred votes will make
the difference, David.</i>

22:37.578 --> 22:40.516
<i>–Well, right now
I have a job to do here.
–A job?</i>

22:40.556 --> 22:44.318
The chief is going to
take your job away. He told you so.

22:44.362 --> 22:47.530
This primary is all you have,
and it's tomorrow.

22:47.818 --> 22:51.167
You need to be out there.

22:52.746 --> 22:57.234
I have a lot of important decisions
to make. I can't spare the time.

22:57.963 --> 23:01.290
Sofer, what the hell's up
with your partner?

23:01.324 --> 23:04.643
–What do you mean?
–This gay thing. You know about that?

23:04.683 --> 23:07.044
I know that guy in the cage
is a total player.

23:07.084 --> 23:11.440
–Sounded convincing to me.
–Yeah, and why would he lie about that?

23:12.042 --> 23:12.806
Who knows?

23:12.970 --> 23:15.330
That Arab widow came after me
for no reason.

23:15.370 --> 23:17.730
–You killed her old man.
–You know, I think the question here is…

23:17.770 --> 23:21.154
if Julien's lyin' about this,
then what else is Julien lying about?

23:21.194 --> 23:23.561
And how could
we trust him now?

23:27.818 --> 23:30.082
You know what?
Julien's a good cop.

23:30.122 --> 23:32.962
–Most of the time, better than
the two of you combined.
–So it's true, then?

23:33.002 --> 23:35.937
Grow up.

23:36.074 --> 23:39.074
<i>We need prints from his car.
Without prints, there's no warrant.</i>

23:39.114 --> 23:40.866
The lab says
three hours minimum.

23:40.906 --> 23:43.362
His lawyer's gonna
be here in 20 minutes.

23:43.402 --> 23:45.570
Now you give me five minutes
alone with him…

23:45.610 --> 23:48.866
–And you'll what?
–Once he lawyers up, things get
much more difficult for us.

23:48.906 --> 23:51.466
Okay.
How about this?

23:51.500 --> 23:55.042
<i>–Let him go. You wait for
the warrant. I'll follow him.
–Yeah.</i>

23:55.082 --> 23:58.594
–What could go wrong with that?
–What could go right is,
he leads us right to Jeffrey.

23:58.634 --> 24:00.418
He might not be able
to resist the thrill.

24:00.458 --> 24:04.616
<i>Look, once his lawyer gets here,
he's gonna walk anyway.</i>

24:06.826 --> 24:08.866
All right.

24:13.610 --> 24:15.810
–My lawyer here?
–Uh, no, not yet.

24:15.850 --> 24:19.746
But, uh, there's been a mistake.
We were able to clear you as a suspect.

24:19.786 --> 24:23.416
You're free to go.
I'm-I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

24:35.434 --> 24:37.572
Shit.

24:39.180 --> 24:40.962
<i>–Damn it.
–Went straight home.</i>

24:41.002 --> 24:43.362
<i>The one place we can't
bust in without a warrant.</i>

24:43.402 --> 24:45.634
–Well, what if Jeffrey's in there?
–Jesus.

24:45.674 --> 24:48.514
<i>Look, maybe we just tell a judge we
heard the kid screamin', had to go in.</i>

24:48.554 --> 24:52.322
If Jeffrey isn't in there, we've ruined
any shot we have at a legit arrest.

24:52.362 --> 24:55.875
All right, so what do we do?

24:56.074 --> 24:58.856
<i>–Aw, man!
–Mmm-mm!</i>

25:15.146 --> 25:16.968
Hey, hey, Julien, what are…

25:24.490 --> 25:26.466
<i>It makes it awfully hard
to defend this place to the chief…</i>

25:26.506 --> 25:29.572
when I see crap like this.

25:29.770 --> 25:34.126
<i>Anyone who knows who did this
has an obligation to tell me.</i>

25:36.266 --> 25:39.364
Let's start acting like adults.

25:46.186 --> 25:48.739
<i>Okay, here they are.</i>

25:59.626 --> 26:02.561
–That's the son of a bitch's house.
–Yeah.

26:02.698 --> 26:04.611
Once we're finally
able to go inside…

26:04.651 --> 26:07.426
I'm gonna need you to identify
anything that belongs to your son.

26:07.466 --> 26:10.914
–What are we waiting for?
–A search warrant.

26:11.082 --> 26:13.603
The judge we pulled
is just left of Karl Marx.

26:13.643 --> 26:17.346
–Our captain is trying to soften him up now.
–How long do you have to wait?

26:17.386 --> 26:19.394
<i>A while.
Maybe the rest of the day.</i>

26:19.434 --> 26:22.338
<i>Wait a minute, man. My son is in there.
He could be doin'…</i>

26:22.378 --> 26:24.418
The law only allows us
so much latitude.

26:24.458 --> 26:27.720
These guys have rights too.
I'm a cop.

26:27.882 --> 26:29.857
I have to honor that.

26:32.650 --> 26:34.472
Well, I'm not a cop.

26:36.938 --> 26:40.484
That's true. Just a father
lookin' out for his son.

26:46.506 --> 26:49.538
<i>–You check this guy for a weapon?
–Yeah, I patted him down.</i>

26:49.578 --> 26:53.076
Good. This guy'd kill for his kid,
so let's be ready.

26:57.802 --> 27:00.640
Ooh, that's a felony
in progress. Let's go.

27:03.370 --> 27:06.239
<i>Where is he?</i>

27:06.378 --> 27:08.800
Where is he?
Where's my son?

27:08.970 --> 27:13.260
Where's my son? Where's Jeffrey?
Where's my son? Where's Jeffrey?

27:13.354 --> 27:16.226
–He was in my car, but I did not
kidnap him. I swear!
–That's enough!

27:16.266 --> 27:18.564
<i>–Stop! Right now!
–Where's Jeffrey?</i>

27:18.604 --> 27:21.730
Hey, he was in your car,
and you didn't kidnap him?

27:21.770 --> 27:23.748
<i>–Try again, you bastard!
–Where is he?</i>

27:23.788 --> 27:26.786
I just picked him up,
and I offered him $20 for a blow job.

27:26.826 --> 27:29.346
Keep goin'!

27:29.546 --> 27:33.890
We went behind a grocery, and then he pulled
a knife, stole my wallet and hit me.

27:33.930 --> 27:38.273
<i>–I did not kidnap him.
–You liar!
–Your son attacked me!</i>

27:38.442 --> 27:41.922
Let me get him!
Let me get him! Let me get him!

27:47.178 --> 27:50.756
Hey, hold on.
Vic, where's Adam?

27:50.954 --> 27:52.645
He's not our guy.

27:52.842 --> 27:55.010
<i>–How do you know?
–Ruled him out.</i>

27:55.050 --> 27:56.962
Doesn't have the kid.
Checked his house and everything.

27:57.002 --> 27:59.173
I asked where's Adam.

28:01.098 --> 28:03.432
He's at his house.

28:03.594 --> 28:05.318
What did you do?

28:20.554 --> 28:22.659
William…

28:22.794 --> 28:24.962
you told me
Jeffrey was a good kid.

28:25.002 --> 28:27.274
That's not what I'm hearin' now.

28:27.308 --> 28:29.634
<i>I never said he was a saint,
but he's got a good heart.</i>

28:29.674 --> 28:33.186
<i>My guy in Venice talked to
some more of Jeffrey's friends.</i>

28:33.226 --> 28:35.876
He's been sellin' drugs. He's been
gettin' in fights, carrying a knife…

28:35.916 --> 28:39.683
–No. No, not Jeffrey.
–We know he's been rollin'
queens with that knife.

28:39.723 --> 28:42.099
Why, 'cause some baby-raper says so?

28:42.122 --> 28:45.634
Look, another kid is dead.
I don't know how Jeffrey's involved in that.

28:45.674 --> 28:48.009
He's not.

28:48.170 --> 28:50.434
I'm sorry. I… I…
I know this is hard…

28:50.474 --> 28:53.986
but you don't know Jeffrey as well as
you've been lettin' on, do ya?

28:54.026 --> 28:57.604
–I need to leave.
–You need to help me find him.

28:57.866 --> 28:59.450
I don't wanna hear this.

28:59.467 --> 29:02.899
There's another boy dead.
His name is Lydell Crouch.

29:03.082 --> 29:07.106
–Now, you need to think
about how his parents feel.
–I know how they feel.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.890
I been helpin' you all day.
Now you're gonna help me.

29:09.930 --> 29:11.872
Help you arrest my son?

29:12.010 --> 29:14.376
No. I'm leavin'.

29:14.538 --> 29:16.741
You can't arrest me.

29:18.154 --> 29:20.488
Hey! Hey, what's the charge?

29:20.650 --> 29:23.039
–Assault.
–Well, you had me do that!

29:23.210 --> 29:25.090
<i>No, I didn't.
I told you the facts.</i>

29:25.130 --> 29:27.367
You decided what to do with 'em.

29:29.930 --> 29:32.770
Look, believe it or not,
I'm trying to help you.

29:32.810 --> 29:35.912
Safest place you could be
right now is in here.

29:40.042 --> 29:42.946
–What are you doing?
–I'm trying to salvage what's left of my job.

29:42.986 --> 29:46.178
David, please, you can't.
It'll cost you the election.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.098
Hey, at least I can do
the right thing here then.

29:48.138 --> 29:49.986
<i>–What do you gain by it?
–Nothing.</i>

29:50.026 --> 29:52.930
–Then why?
–Because I can't fire people arbitrarily…

29:52.970 --> 29:54.884
or in between campaign stops.

29:54.890 --> 29:57.378
<i>You'll have no job
and no political career.</i>

29:57.418 --> 30:00.069
I won't do it.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.402
You're gonna be
throwin' both away.

30:02.442 --> 30:04.929
You don't think
I've thought of that?

30:10.923 --> 30:13.192
Hey.

30:13.354 --> 30:15.142
Okay.

30:17.226 --> 30:19.015
<i>Police!</i>

30:26.283 --> 30:28.006
–What happened?
–Nothin'.

30:28.203 --> 30:29.985
I just wanna be left alone.

30:46.890 --> 30:48.810
<i>I saw Adam.</i>

30:48.844 --> 30:52.002
William went after him. Good thing
we were there in time to break it up.

30:52.042 --> 30:54.242
So how did he know
where his house was?

30:54.282 --> 30:56.162
Probably heard
somethin' around here.

30:56.202 --> 30:59.010
You allowed an innocent man
to get the shit kicked out of him.

30:59.050 --> 31:01.426
He's not innocent.
He's a pedophile.

31:03.978 --> 31:06.050
<i>But he's innocent
of this crime.</i>

31:06.090 --> 31:09.698
Ah, I'm sure he'll think twice before cruisin'
the school yard and committing his next crime.

31:09.738 --> 31:13.302
But he's innocent now!
You just don't get that, do ya?

31:13.386 --> 31:15.050
<i>Boss!</i>

31:15.083 --> 31:18.727
Kyle Hutton.
He's a 15-year-old piece of work.

31:19.274 --> 31:22.914
<i>Jeffrey's friends in Venice say that he's
the only one that Jeffrey talks to anymore.</i>

31:22.954 --> 31:25.256
Cool.

31:30.218 --> 31:33.506
I already told that monkey cop.
I don't know where he is.

31:33.546 --> 31:36.229
<i>What'd you just say?</i>

31:36.426 --> 31:39.906
–Nothin'.
–“Monkey cop.”

31:41.226 --> 31:44.008
You said it for a reason.

31:44.106 --> 31:47.868
Come on. You got special
insights in life. Let's hear it.

31:49.738 --> 31:53.764
<i>80% of the world
doesn't look like you.</i>

31:53.898 --> 31:56.362
I'll bet that drives
you crazy, huh?

31:56.396 --> 32:00.686
–Let's see how hard-core you really are.
–Don't touch me, faggot!

32:01.323 --> 32:03.875
Nice.

32:05.994 --> 32:08.580
Where'd you pick up
that party line?

32:08.650 --> 32:11.781
The Internet?
Some angry short-order cook…

32:12.042 --> 32:13.955
<i>a couple of credits
short on his G.E.D?</i>

32:13.995 --> 32:17.704
–I been reading.
–Jeffrey read those books in school?

32:17.770 --> 32:20.520
No way.
That school's all Negro.

32:21.066 --> 32:24.258
<i>Jeffrey can't even walk
to class without gettin'jumped.</i>

32:24.298 --> 32:28.805
–He have any trouble with Lydell Crouch?
–Him and his homies. Yeah.

32:29.962 --> 32:33.592
<i>–So Jeffrey took out Lydell.
–I didn't say that.</i>

32:37.450 --> 32:41.674
<i>What's Jeffrey's beef with the gay guys
over on Doverson?</i>

32:42.314 --> 32:44.648
No beef. Just for fun.

32:44.810 --> 32:49.000
When we need cash, we pull a knife,
take their wallets.

32:49.162 --> 32:51.362
They're not gonna
talk to the cops…

32:51.402 --> 32:54.083
<i>say they're tryin'to
fudge-pack some teenagers.</i>

32:54.123 --> 32:57.538
What'd Jeffrey
need money for last night?

32:57.898 --> 33:01.444
A gun to kill Lydell with?

33:01.706 --> 33:06.656
<i>Is that what he was plannin'to do
with the rest of Lydell's buddies?</i>

33:09.706 --> 33:11.845
Come here!
You see that?

33:11.978 --> 33:13.866
You see that?

33:13.900 --> 33:18.658
<i>If there's one thing this country's good
at, it's incarcerating black males.</i>

33:18.698 --> 33:20.902
That's where they belong.

33:21.066 --> 33:23.914
Yeah? Well, guess what?

33:23.948 --> 33:27.458
It's one thing to chant “Heil Hitler”
in your buddy's rec room.

33:27.498 --> 33:30.114
It's another thing entirely
to say it loud and proud…

33:30.154 --> 33:32.258
in the exercise yard
at Pelican Bay.

33:32.298 --> 33:36.514
You do the math and tell me exactly how it is
you think you're gonna survive down there.

33:36.554 --> 33:39.554
With help
from the brotherhood.

33:51.114 --> 33:52.903
I don't get it.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.802
You got the attitude.
You got the tats.

33:56.842 --> 34:00.006
Why would you help a nigger?

34:00.170 --> 34:03.602
<i>–I'd never do that.
–Well, you are right now.</i>

34:04.394 --> 34:09.664
–Jeff's father's a black guy.
–I've met his mom. She's pure.

34:09.833 --> 34:12.353
His dad's not.

34:12.554 --> 34:16.678
Look. See that guy right there?
That's Jeffrey's dad.

34:16.842 --> 34:21.119
–No, it's not.
–Yes, it is.

34:22.762 --> 34:24.808
Jeffrey never told you, did he?

34:28.010 --> 34:30.399
Come on.

34:30.570 --> 34:33.091
I'll go introduce you to him.

34:34.634 --> 34:38.147
<i>Then you'll tell me
where I can find Jeffrey.</i>

34:38.378 --> 34:43.014
<i>–Jeffrey's a nigger?
–The worst kind.</i>

35:13.323 --> 35:16.639
<i>Shane!</i>

35:16.810 --> 35:19.046
–Shane!
–Oh, God. Shane!

35:19.210 --> 35:22.658
He's hit! Oh, God! Shane!

35:26.602 --> 35:28.425
Drop it!

35:34.890 --> 35:37.476
Everyone all right?

35:37.674 --> 35:41.028
Shane took one in the vest.
Luckily the door slowed the bullet down first.

35:41.068 --> 35:44.896
<i>It's just a bruise.
Found this in Jeffrey's pocket.</i>

35:44.938 --> 35:48.098
It's a hit list and a map of
his victims' houses circled.

35:48.138 --> 35:50.850
You got him before
his spree really started.

35:50.890 --> 35:52.679
Lem got him.

36:09.366 --> 36:13.327
–What's goin' on?
–Somebody called my house.

36:13.526 --> 36:16.821
–They told Vanessa?
–They told Randall.

36:17.078 --> 36:19.918
A 10-year-old boy.
They just threw it in his face.

36:19.958 --> 36:22.512
<i>–Oh, man, that's horrible.
–I made those choices.</i>

36:22.552 --> 36:24.910
<i>–I can live with the consequences.
–Julien…</i>

36:24.950 --> 36:27.601
But why punish a little boy?

36:46.934 --> 36:48.723
Keys.

37:06.710 --> 37:08.946
Jeffrey was armed.

37:10.326 --> 37:14.287
<i>He was planning
on hurting other kids.</i>

37:14.454 --> 37:19.470
<i>He shot another police officer
in the chest. We had no choice but to…</i>

37:25.014 --> 37:28.559
I really tried
to get him back to you.

37:37.654 --> 37:39.568
I've got a ton of work to do.

37:39.606 --> 37:42.158
Whoever killed those other
two boys is still out there.

37:42.198 --> 37:46.574
Gotta comb through the rest of Brent's files,
make sure nothing else was missed…

37:46.614 --> 37:48.590
probably re-interview witnesses.

37:48.630 --> 37:50.766
Can't let the trail get too cold.

37:50.806 --> 37:53.141
Probably not
gonna get much sleep.

37:53.302 --> 37:55.090
I'll see ya in the morning.

38:04.534 --> 38:06.830
Pitching him not to cut it so deeply
on the supplemental…

38:06.870 --> 38:09.270
and that pencil-neck
deputy of his…

38:09.303 --> 38:11.150
–uh, what's that… that guy Kelly…
–Kelly.

38:11.190 --> 38:14.319
Pipes in and says,
“What about the supplemental?”

38:14.359 --> 38:16.530
–And the…
–Excuse me.

38:18.134 --> 38:21.430
I'm sorry to disturb your dinner.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.794
It's quite all right.

38:23.959 --> 38:25.649
What can I help you with?

38:27.574 --> 38:30.518
If you offered me
that job, I'd take it.

38:30.552 --> 38:33.453
–So now you want it?
–No, but I'd take it.

38:35.190 --> 38:37.434
You always communicate in riddles?

38:38.742 --> 38:41.006
I've kept
my head down long enough.

38:41.046 --> 38:42.926
I don't like
what I'm seeing lately…

38:42.966 --> 38:45.936
so it's either do something about it
or quit.

38:47.190 --> 38:49.678
And I'm way too young to retire.

38:51.702 --> 38:53.327
Enjoy your meal.

39:05.239 --> 39:08.112
Look, I know you don't
wanna talk about this…

39:08.152 --> 39:10.702
but me, Lem and Ronnie really think
that there might be…

39:10.742 --> 39:12.848
<i>–Money train's back on.
–What?</i>

39:12.888 --> 39:16.848
<i>Look, I don't know
how we're gonna do it, but we are.</i>

39:20.982 --> 39:23.600
We have to make it work…

39:25.078 --> 39:28.624
because we do need it
to get past all this.

39:28.982 --> 39:31.732
The money train's our safety net.

39:33.558 --> 39:37.104
The way things are changin'…

39:37.302 --> 39:39.407
we're gonna need one soon.

39:46.902 --> 39:48.626
<i>Well.</i>

39:48.822 --> 39:51.792
<i>I see you've been
doing your homework.</i>

39:52.630 --> 39:54.354
You have those names?

40:01.366 --> 40:03.822
–Is this a joke?
–No.

40:03.990 --> 40:06.254
<i>I told you to cut
the work force by 20%.</i>

40:06.294 --> 40:09.390
<i>–There are five names on this list.
–Those are the real problems.</i>

40:09.430 --> 40:12.622
The others are good, hardworking people
who deserve to keep their jobs.

40:12.662 --> 40:15.379
–Vic Mackey?
–It all starts with him.

40:15.574 --> 40:17.686
Shane Vendrell,
Ronald Gardocki…

40:17.782 --> 40:19.571
Curtis Lemansky…

40:22.742 --> 40:24.466
David Aceveda.

40:24.566 --> 40:27.074
They couldn't
have done it without me.

40:31.158 --> 40:32.881
That's all right.

40:33.078 --> 40:35.566
<i>I sent the same list to the Times
and a few of the news stations.</i>

40:35.606 --> 40:37.329
<i>What?</i>

40:37.399 --> 40:40.654
<i>The election is tomorrow.
This'll kill you.</i>

40:40.694 --> 40:43.955
I know.

40:44.119 --> 40:48.366
It's the only way to pressure you into
doing something about the strike team…

40:48.406 --> 40:50.643
once and for all.

40:53.719 --> 40:55.507
Julien.

41:00.534 --> 41:03.758
Listen, it's just a couple of guys.
They're assholes.

41:03.798 --> 41:06.286
<i>It's not the whole barn.</i>

41:08.150 --> 41:10.658
I need to get home
to my wife and son.

41:20.982 --> 41:24.081
–Detective Vic Mackey?
–Yeah?

41:24.150 --> 41:26.096
–You're wanted for questioning, sir.
–Excuse me?

41:26.136 --> 41:29.902
Your ex-wife filed a domestic dispute
complaint, says you broke into her home.

41:29.942 --> 41:33.521
First of all, it's my wife,
and it's my home.

41:33.686 --> 41:36.078
I don't know the facts.
We're just here to affect the arrest.

41:36.118 --> 41:40.276
<i>–Jesus Christ. It's just a misunderstanding.
–I'm sorry.</i>

41:41.046 --> 41:42.927
I work here.
I know these people.

41:42.967 --> 41:45.871
Please, can these wait
until we get outside?

41:46.006 --> 41:47.829
You know I can't do that.

41:48.022 --> 41:49.844
We need your gun.

41:51.319 --> 41:53.431
Can you block the way, at least?

41:53.494 --> 41:55.282
Gun.

41:56.502 --> 41:58.673
Here.

42:01.046 --> 42:03.884
<i>–What in the hell is this?
–Corrine.</i>

42:03.958 --> 42:06.926
–We had an argument. It's a mistake.
–Jesus Christ.

42:06.966 --> 42:09.710
–Ah, come on. Guys, it's bullshit.
–I'm sorry.

42:09.750 --> 42:11.725
Hold on a second.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.019
–I got him.
–Thanks.
