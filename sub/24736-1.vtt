03:15.128 --> 03:18.499
- Thirty years I waited
to see this place.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.614
- It's not what it looks
like that matters.

03:22.638 --> 03:24.571
It's what it feels like.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.474
The Altai's one of the most
spiritual places on Earth.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.909
Healing, magic, energy.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.870
They tap into shit here
that the rest of the world

03:31.894 --> 03:34.062
can't even comprehend yet.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.568
- Maybe that's what
you want to believe

03:36.569 --> 03:38.369
so that you didn't waste
the last thirty years

03:38.393 --> 03:40.210
of your life studying it.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.224
- Cynicism.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.687
It's easy but it doesn't leave
much room for happiness.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.599
- I'll keep that
in mind professor.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.403
- Personally, I'd rather
be in the Bahamas.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.044
- Well, maybe next time
you could've asked

03:58.045 --> 03:59.445
one of your friends
from the Bahamas

03:59.469 --> 04:02.099
to get stabbed four
times instead.

04:04.144 --> 04:07.915
- Jesus, how'd I get
stuck in a car with you?

04:14.922 --> 04:17.857
- Any idea what we should
say to Kara's parents?

04:17.858 --> 04:18.858
"I'm sorry?"

04:19.827 --> 04:21.228
"My condolences?"

04:22.863 --> 04:24.464
- Don't say anything.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.633
It's been a year.

04:26.634 --> 04:30.202
- Yeah, they've probably
already gotten over it, huh?

04:30.203 --> 04:32.163
- I just mean maybe they
don't want to be reminded

04:32.187 --> 04:35.274
their daughter's dead the
moment we step out of the car.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.509
- And you think they won't be,

04:36.510 --> 04:38.177
surrounded by all
of her friends?

04:38.178 --> 04:41.948
- Maybe it'll be a little
awkward when they see you, huh?

04:41.949 --> 04:43.451
- Mike, let it go.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.258
- You coulda all been one
big happy family, Alice.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.394
- Is this you letting
it go, Mike?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.162
- You think I'm the
only one thinking that?

04:56.163 --> 04:58.203
- No, but you're the only
one who's a big enough ass

04:58.227 --> 04:59.461
to bring it up.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.842
- There's bodies in
these mountains.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.214
- In 1993, archeologists
found a female mummy

05:15.215 --> 05:16.849
encased in ice.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.352
Twenty-five hundred years old.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.554
The Altai did not
want her moved.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.322
Said she was there
to bar the entrance

05:23.323 --> 05:25.091
of the kingdom of the dead.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.158
- Let me guess.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.527
They moved her?

05:27.528 --> 05:28.728
- And as soon as they did,

05:28.729 --> 05:30.663
an earthquake shook
the whole area.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.832
Floods, disease.

05:32.833 --> 05:36.703
Christ, even the suicide
rate went up around here.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.872
- Sounds like a good time.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.533
- Let's just say
this isn't a place

05:41.557 --> 05:44.560
where the dead like
to be disturbed.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.057
- It'll be fine.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.226
But if you need anything.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.194
- Thanks.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.173
- Hey.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.408
Hey.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.377
It's okay.

06:50.378 --> 06:51.712
Don't be scared.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.621
- If even the locals
gotta ask directions,

07:01.622 --> 07:04.825
we're really going to
the middle of nowhere.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.326
- This is Siberia.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.497
Everywhere's in the
middle of nowhere.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.832
- Oh my God.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.188
- Welcome to my home!

07:36.189 --> 07:37.990
It's very good to uh...

07:37.991 --> 07:39.992
English, I understand

07:39.993 --> 07:41.694
but uh, speak not so...

07:41.695 --> 07:42.929
- This is Piotr.

07:42.930 --> 07:43.531
I'm Sergei, the one
who wrote you.

07:43.532 --> 07:44.597
Welcome.

07:44.598 --> 07:45.432
- Mike.

07:45.432 --> 07:46.432
- Ah, Mike.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.301
- Helen.

07:52.206 --> 07:53.206
- Tony.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.307
- Ah, my man.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.177
- Hi.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.179
- Alice.

08:00.849 --> 08:01.849
Come! Come!

08:01.850 --> 08:04.416
- Please, hot tea inside.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.587
Welcome, my friend, welcome.

08:34.881 --> 08:39.251
- You want to show
everybody you're a tool?

08:45.826 --> 08:48.328
He's like the Siberian Tarzan.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.616
- It's a Tree of Spirits.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.584
- In our culture, we
believe that the distance

09:11.585 --> 09:14.286
between the living and the
dead is not that far.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.757
And some spirits
choose to remain here.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.358
- So people hang ribbons.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.127
- As a sign of respect.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.730
And to make a wish.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.799
What do you really want in life?

09:36.910 --> 09:39.346
- I gotta show you something.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.578
I miss Kara too but...

10:12.579 --> 10:14.447
- This is just creepy.

10:19.519 --> 10:20.519
- Alice,

10:21.321 --> 10:22.956
it's Brandon.

10:26.660 --> 10:30.562
- And you'd think they
wouldn't want to see him here.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.899
- Hate to say this but

10:32.900 --> 10:36.804
you'd think they wouldn't
wanna see you either.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.855
- This must be why we're here.

10:59.592 --> 11:00.592
- Coño bro,

11:01.762 --> 11:04.197
my computer doesn't
turn on, man.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.767
Here, let me take a look.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.001
- Oh, wait.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.503
I know what it is.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.345
Bringing that shit?

11:19.346 --> 11:21.247
- Tio, when traveling
internacional,

11:21.248 --> 11:22.481
it's called smuggling.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.684
- Are you familiar
with the term "gulag?"

11:33.927 --> 11:34.927
- Hey.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.765
Sorry about back in the car.
I guess I'm just...

11:38.766 --> 11:39.767
- It's fine.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.201
- I just...

11:43.570 --> 11:47.474
want Kara's parents to
know Brandon didn't do it.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.377
You believe that, right?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.946
- It doesn't matter
what I believe.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.715
I wasn't on the jury.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.586
- Helen told me that your dad

12:00.587 --> 12:02.054
was gonna look through the case.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.522
- I, yeah.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.723
- Because if we could get one
of the top defense lawyers

12:05.747 --> 12:06.867
in the country to help us...

12:08.561 --> 12:09.963
- No. No.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.433
- That doesn't mean I didn't
want to know the truth.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.936
I asked my dad to take the case
when Brandon was arrested.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.204
He was too busy.

12:18.205 --> 12:21.941
I asked him when Brandon
was convicted, he said,

12:21.942 --> 12:25.511
"do you know how hard the
appeals process would be?"

12:25.512 --> 12:28.280
At Brandon's sentencing, you
wanna know what he said then?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.601
"I didn't put you
through college"

12:29.625 --> 12:31.784
"getting innocent
people out of jail."

12:31.785 --> 12:33.787
"They don't pay enough."

12:35.889 --> 12:38.491
If there was new evidence, I...

12:40.714 --> 12:42.194
Is there anything
that suggests to you

12:42.195 --> 12:46.033
that Brandon wasn't the
one who murdered Kara?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.669
- I can't get a signal.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.939
Is there like internet,
phone service?

12:52.940 --> 12:55.140
- Oh, not until the construction's
finished in the house.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.010
- End of summer.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.178
- Yeah, I totally dig it, man.

12:59.202 --> 13:00.112
Off the grid.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.514
Un-fucking-plugged.

13:54.428 --> 13:56.028
- Dan, am I on a bad
trip or is that a...

13:56.052 --> 13:56.936
- It's a doll.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.106
It's a freaky little doll.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.046
- Did he just... Serve it food?

14:07.047 --> 14:08.047
Yeah.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.755
- Alright, man. Fuck it.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.528
- Piotr is preparing
as a shaman now.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.397
It's important for the ceremony
to take place tonight,

14:25.398 --> 14:29.301
on the one year
anniversary of Kara's...

14:29.302 --> 14:30.302
Death.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.344
- We'll pay our respects later.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.512
- This is an Itterma
doll, right?

14:40.513 --> 14:41.513
- Mhmm.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.152
- Did you make it with
Kara's actual hair?

14:46.153 --> 14:48.654
- Piotr cut it off before
she was put in her coffin.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.823
That's her favorite dress.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.385
- Isn't that what she wearing
the night she was killed?

14:55.628 --> 14:57.763
- They washed out
the blood stains.

14:57.764 --> 15:00.367
- And they stitched
the knife holes.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.514
- Kara.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.356
- The Itterma doll acts like a

15:57.357 --> 15:59.691
vessel for one's spirit.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.627
- Having all of you here tonight

16:01.628 --> 16:03.796
the way Kara was in her
final moments helps to...

16:05.432 --> 16:06.432
- Yeah.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.904
- Can you stop
touching Kara's hair?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.245
- It's amazing.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.550
- Yeah, that's not the
word I would've used.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.138
- Kara!

17:29.482 --> 17:31.150
- This is delicious, Sergei.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.018
You like it?

17:32.018 --> 17:33.018
- Oh.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.563
You guys aren't eating?

17:59.946 --> 18:00.946
- Come.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.843
- Kara's mother.

18:31.844 --> 18:32.844
Father.

18:40.753 --> 18:44.690
- I thought you said her family
wanted us to come out here.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.958
- A week after Kara's body
got shipped from the States,

18:46.959 --> 18:48.261
her parent's car got...

18:51.498 --> 18:53.900
it went off a mountain cliff.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.739
- I am family.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.074
Kara, my sister.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.218
- He's asking for permission.

19:12.219 --> 19:15.455
To call upon the dead in the
presence of the living.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.192
It must be Kara's.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.261
They just haven't
put her in it yet.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.663
- We believe that

19:24.931 --> 19:28.634
the ground is for those
who found peace.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.635
The sky

19:30.970 --> 19:34.040
is for those who are
still searching.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.175
- After ceremony.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.678
We bury my sister.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.486
- Come.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.561
Come.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.267
- Alice, please.

20:39.306 --> 20:41.140
Please, guys, welcome.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.445
Jeff. Helen.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.047
Mike.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.524
This way, sir.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.262
Take your hands, please.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.302
Because Kara was killed
in an act of violence,

21:10.303 --> 21:13.038
her soul has remained in
a state of confusion.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.906
Trapped between the two worlds.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.008
Begging for peace.

21:19.746 --> 21:22.448
The shamans call it the
Black Sky Ceremony.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.449
- Kara.

21:24.717 --> 21:28.520
- It allows the feelings you
have for Kara to flow out.

21:28.521 --> 21:33.124
And the love you have for
her becomes like a light,

21:33.125 --> 21:36.128
to guide her soul
from the darkness.

22:57.010 --> 22:58.010
- Go!

22:58.011 --> 22:59.479
Get out! Get out! Get out!

23:09.288 --> 23:10.522
- I didn't sign up for this!

23:10.523 --> 23:11.858
I didn't fucking
sign up for this!

23:13.392 --> 23:14.627
- I don't know.

23:17.129 --> 23:20.066
- Hey! Was that
supposed to happen?

23:23.637 --> 23:24.637
- No.

23:24.638 --> 23:25.871
It was...

23:25.872 --> 23:27.539
- It was fucked up
is what it was.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.040
Can somebody please

23:29.041 --> 23:31.042
tell me that that shit
wasn't just in my head?

23:31.043 --> 23:32.210
- And the smell.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.491
- It smelled like fucking death.

23:33.492 --> 23:34.393
I can't get it out of my nose.

23:34.394 --> 23:35.982
- Kara's hair burning.

23:46.058 --> 23:49.027
- The Black Sky ceremony is...

23:49.028 --> 23:50.529
is very powerful.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.297
It's been passed on
through our shamans

23:52.298 --> 23:53.866
for many, many centuries.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.406
Because you've never seen
anything like it before.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.143
- Doing field research
in Tibet, Mongolia.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.112
I saw white magic
in the rituals.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.850
Shit that can't be
explained by natural laws.

24:13.152 --> 24:16.722
- The Altai tell us our
universe is layered.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.557
Levels of heaven,

24:18.558 --> 24:20.391
levels of the underworld.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.729
Our Piotr just opened a gate.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.298
The question is, in
which direction?

24:27.299 --> 24:30.135
- Maybe you wanna
fucking elaborate?

24:30.136 --> 24:31.603
- Everything is energy.

24:31.604 --> 24:34.339
Light energy, dark energy.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.708
And it flows back and forth.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.810
And when you communicate
with the spirit world,

24:38.811 --> 24:41.146
it doesn't just
receive messages.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.749
It also sends them.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.818
That's what this was.

24:47.654 --> 24:48.654
A message.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.498
- Ask the shaman.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.781
- I think...

25:15.782 --> 25:16.782
You...

25:18.184 --> 25:20.186
no sleep for many hours.

25:21.554 --> 25:24.022
- But what the fuck
just happened?

25:24.023 --> 25:26.425
What the fuck just happened?!

25:27.794 --> 25:29.061
- Kara.

26:03.029 --> 26:06.432
- It was sorta crazy
before it got crazy.

26:08.034 --> 26:11.036
- We've definitely
veered off into...

26:11.037 --> 26:13.739
""

26:13.740 --> 26:14.740
- Exactly.

26:26.653 --> 26:29.822
It was brave of you
to even come here.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.894
Knowing how they'd look at you.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.865
What they'd think of you.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.667
We all lost our friend.
But you...

26:41.668 --> 26:43.670
- I didn't lose Brandon.

26:45.772 --> 26:50.508
I'm still gonna visit him
every Sunday, twelve to one.

26:50.509 --> 26:54.113
Until they find out who
really killed Kara.

26:56.649 --> 26:59.886
Maybe then they can
even bury her, huh?

27:05.057 --> 27:07.158
- So the spirit world's
sending a message, huh?

27:07.159 --> 27:08.760
I mean, what the fuck?

27:08.761 --> 27:11.029
Maybe arson's not the best
way to fucking communicate,

27:11.030 --> 27:12.030
ya know?

27:23.876 --> 27:26.545
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.499
- It's going to be all right.

28:56.435 --> 29:00.138
- Alice is still convinced
Brandon didn't do it.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.607
Fuck Brandon. Okay?

29:02.608 --> 29:05.410
I'm more concerned with
the lunatics downstairs

29:05.411 --> 29:09.380
than the one in prison
half a world away.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.149
- On the plane,

29:11.150 --> 29:12.683
in the car,

29:12.684 --> 29:15.821
you barely said two words to me.

29:15.822 --> 29:18.090
You think I don't know why?

29:31.137 --> 29:35.307
You only wanna sleep with me
when you need a distraction.

30:37.669 --> 30:41.840
(Kara voiceover
speaking Russian)

31:09.735 --> 31:12.037
- That Altai voodoo
shit you did,

31:12.038 --> 31:13.805
blew my fucking mind.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.013
You know Kara

31:22.014 --> 31:25.850
was the first person I met
when I came to the U.S.

31:25.851 --> 31:28.020
Both from far away places.

31:29.688 --> 31:32.857
But she made friends
with everybody.

31:32.858 --> 31:36.095
Some of us like each
other, some don't,

31:38.030 --> 31:40.132
but we all loved Kara.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.972
I was gonna show her Barcelona

31:48.007 --> 31:52.177
and she was gonna show
me the Altai mountains.

31:52.178 --> 31:53.345
And here I am,

31:54.746 --> 31:56.815
here we are, without her.

31:59.718 --> 32:00.718
Life, tio.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.223
Fucking life.

32:07.193 --> 32:11.562
It's just burning away
right in front of us

32:11.563 --> 32:14.800
and we don't even
fucking know it, man.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.003
- Okay, okay, smile.

32:18.004 --> 32:18.837
One.

32:18.837 --> 32:19.671
Two.

32:19.672 --> 32:20.972
Three.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.907
- Okay, okay. Okay,
wait, did you take it?

32:22.908 --> 32:23.908
- It's a video.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.146
- I know I'm funny.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.852
Okay, okay, smile.

32:34.853 --> 32:35.687
One.

32:35.687 --> 32:36.522
Two.

32:36.523 --> 32:37.989
Three.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.550
Okay, okay. Okay, wait,
did you take it?

32:39.574 --> 32:40.574
It's a video.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.529
- I know I'm funny.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.684
- Hey Tony, have
you seen Brandon?

33:08.220 --> 33:09.220
He went...

33:11.390 --> 33:12.657
- I saw your face.

33:12.658 --> 33:13.592
You couldn't even
stand the thought

33:13.593 --> 33:15.060
of Brandon marrying Kara.

33:15.061 --> 33:15.727
- No, I couldn't! But that
doesn't mean that I...

33:15.728 --> 33:16.994
- I'm sorry.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.829
I was just looking for
Brandon and Kara.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.331
I need to say goodbye.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.533
- Last I saw, he was arguing
with Rez about something.

33:22.534 --> 33:23.835
- Maybe you were right.

33:36.448 --> 33:37.448
Rez?

33:46.292 --> 33:47.292
Brandon?

33:50.696 --> 33:52.198
- Whoa. I got you.

34:17.255 --> 34:18.456
- I think I saw someone.

34:20.958 --> 34:21.958
Shit.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.330
- There's nobody, Sandra.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.364
- I know what I saw. Did
you check everywhere?

34:27.366 --> 34:29.567
- Look, your mind's
just playing tricks.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.202
We haven't slept in
almost two days.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.771
- Well, I can't sleep anymore.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.774
- Come with me.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.612
Brandon needs me to
make a wish for him.

34:42.614 --> 34:45.416
I'm just going to
wish to go back home.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.752
- Might as well.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.925
Okay.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.108
- Wait, you heard
something too, right?

35:10.942 --> 35:11.942
- Yeah.

35:20.352 --> 35:21.520
What the fuck?

35:23.290 --> 35:24.290
Go!

35:24.291 --> 35:27.293
- Oh my god! Go, go, go, go, go!

35:58.558 --> 35:59.558
- Wait! Wait!

35:59.559 --> 36:01.560
Wait! Wait! Wait!

36:02.594 --> 36:03.594
What?

36:32.524 --> 36:33.524
- Now.

36:51.378 --> 36:52.378
- Alice!

36:52.379 --> 36:53.878
Alice! Alice!

36:53.879 --> 36:54.946
Are you okay?

37:00.018 --> 37:02.187
- Turn it off! Turn it off!

37:07.359 --> 37:08.594
- Take my hand.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.711
Help us!

37:27.513 --> 37:28.646
Help! Help!

37:28.647 --> 37:30.147
Help!

37:30.148 --> 37:31.148
Help!

37:38.290 --> 37:39.290
Help!

37:57.876 --> 37:59.277
- Sandra! Sandra!

38:00.547 --> 38:01.547
It's over.

38:01.548 --> 38:02.980
It's over.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.114
It's over.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.050
- Okay, motherfucker,
who are you?!

38:05.051 --> 38:06.216
- Mike, be careful.

38:06.217 --> 38:07.217
Please.

38:08.887 --> 38:09.887
- Oh, fuck.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.747
- Don't hurt him!

38:36.748 --> 38:38.417
We need to help him.

38:43.855 --> 38:44.856
- We gotta take this out.

38:45.625 --> 38:46.625
- No!

38:46.626 --> 38:47.992
No, you pull it out, it will...

38:47.993 --> 38:49.033
How do you say in English?

38:49.057 --> 38:49.828
- Bleed out.

38:49.829 --> 38:50.995
- Right.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.697
- So we're just gonna
leave him there

38:52.698 --> 38:55.266
with a screwdriver in his back?

38:59.204 --> 39:00.405
Doctor?

39:00.406 --> 39:01.686
- An hour, driving
down the road.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.274
Tomorrow.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.011
Tomorrow we go.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.648
- By tomorrow he could
be fucking dead.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.894
- He's getting medicine.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.692
- Why are you digging
graves in the woods?

40:00.331 --> 40:03.568
- And who are you
putting in them?

40:03.569 --> 40:05.303
- Not what you think.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.207
There's open fucking graves
hidden behind the house!

40:10.208 --> 40:11.476
I fell into one!

40:11.477 --> 40:15.379
- Listen man, you better
start talking right now.

40:15.380 --> 40:16.882
- Not bury people.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.918
- Itterma dolls.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.853
That's what they're burying.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.555
- Of Kara friends.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.323
- Of all of us.

40:26.324 --> 40:28.092
To surround her
with kind spirits.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.694
And to comfort her.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.696
You're comforting the dead

40:31.697 --> 40:33.864
with your bodies up in trees?

40:33.865 --> 40:35.700
Your fucking graves for dolls?

40:35.701 --> 40:39.570
We have to get the fuck out of
here and get Dan some help.

40:39.571 --> 40:40.571
Guys?

40:50.215 --> 40:51.982
- Drugs. Something crazy.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.217
Bath salts or...

40:53.218 --> 40:55.452
- Helen, go fuck yourself.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.288
I speak Spanish and so

40:59.825 --> 41:02.092
because of that I deal meth
in Siberian back alleys?

41:02.093 --> 41:04.429
Like I run a fucking cartel?

41:05.764 --> 41:09.133
- That didn't answer
the question, Tony.

41:09.134 --> 41:12.503
- No, bro, I didn't
give him anything.

41:12.504 --> 41:14.304
And it was after that ceremony

41:14.305 --> 41:16.041
that he started
acting all crazy.

41:17.543 --> 41:20.578
- Crazy. Like when
we went upstairs,

41:20.579 --> 41:22.648
he had some look
in his eye like...

41:23.829 --> 41:25.349
- Like I wouldn't be
surprised if he...

41:25.350 --> 41:27.885
- Started hacking away at his
friends with a fucking ax?

41:27.886 --> 41:29.386
- Actually,

41:29.387 --> 41:32.390
that was still
surprising, but yeah.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.766
- Yeah, impaled with a screwdriver.
Should be fine.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.634
Will you stop the sarcasm?

41:43.635 --> 41:46.503
- You think it's the sarcasm
that's killing him?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.639
- All this guy can ever do
is make a fucking joke.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.140
- You are the joke.

41:50.141 --> 41:51.809
- Rez, back off.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.210
- Yeah, come to his
defense, Helen.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.547
You faithful fucking dog.

41:59.818 --> 42:01.319
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

42:03.889 --> 42:04.889
- Uh oh.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.825
Got some anger
issues there, Mikey.

42:07.826 --> 42:09.193
- Control yourselves.

42:09.194 --> 42:12.530
- Of all the fucking
people to say that.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.172
- Hey!

42:22.173 --> 42:23.909
What did that mean?

42:26.311 --> 42:28.614
- Maybe I know something
you don't want me to?

42:29.981 --> 42:31.101
Or is the threat coming now?

42:31.125 --> 42:33.684
- About what you did to Kara.

42:33.685 --> 42:35.253
To all those girls.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.555
- I heard those rumors
on campus too. Okay?

42:38.556 --> 42:39.390
They're not true.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.390
- I know.

42:41.459 --> 42:42.960
Kara called me!

42:42.961 --> 42:45.081
Too drunk to do more than
mumble in the fucking phone.

42:45.105 --> 42:46.063
Her dress torn-

42:46.064 --> 42:47.397
- You don't know!

42:47.398 --> 42:50.601
Okay? And you'll keep
your fucking mouth shut!

42:50.602 --> 42:52.302
Cause you're a coward.

42:52.303 --> 42:54.772
Cowards can't even kill themselves
when maybe they should.

42:54.773 --> 42:56.841
They try but they're
just too afraid.

42:56.842 --> 42:58.142
- My father hit a lot harder.

42:58.143 --> 42:59.743
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

42:59.767 --> 43:02.346
- The Altai tell us
Kara, out there,

43:02.347 --> 43:04.815
she can't find peace
in the afterlife.

43:04.816 --> 43:07.217
Some people, they can't
find it in this life.

43:07.218 --> 43:08.719
Never gonna be at peace.

43:08.720 --> 43:09.920
They're just hanging around,

43:09.921 --> 43:11.956
haunting the fuck out
of the rest of us.

43:11.957 --> 43:13.891
Is that what you're doing?

43:13.892 --> 43:14.892
Huh?

43:17.062 --> 43:18.262
- Well, at least you're taking

43:18.263 --> 43:21.432
to abusing people while
they're conscious.

43:50.361 --> 43:54.199
- There's something I
gotta show you upstairs.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.065
- During the ceremony,

46:08.066 --> 46:12.336
your love for Kara should
have been manifested

46:12.337 --> 46:14.940
as a good guiding spirit.

46:19.310 --> 46:22.146
If there is darkness, if there
is hate, then that too can...

46:22.147 --> 46:25.382
- Then the ceremony
releases that too?

46:25.383 --> 46:26.383
- Right.

46:30.188 --> 46:31.188
- For Kara.

46:33.358 --> 46:34.558
- We call it "kyuryum"

46:34.559 --> 46:36.159
but you may have a
different word for it.

46:36.183 --> 46:37.183
- Demon.

46:38.263 --> 46:41.132
- So the ceremony
created an evil...

46:43.434 --> 46:45.235
- It can not create.

46:45.236 --> 46:49.640
It can only take the bad that
is already inside of you.

46:55.246 --> 46:57.915
- So you're blaming us for
what happened to Dan?

46:57.916 --> 47:00.651
- Why would you do something
that risked our lives?

47:02.387 --> 47:05.389
You all friends of Kara, yes?

47:05.390 --> 47:06.858
- Yes.

47:07.959 --> 47:09.294
- Yes.

47:11.062 --> 47:12.062
- Yes.

47:15.033 --> 47:16.033
- Yeah.

47:16.767 --> 47:17.767
- No.

47:19.537 --> 47:20.605
One of you...

47:22.473 --> 47:23.473
Kill Kara.

47:24.575 --> 47:26.211
You killed my sister.

47:30.781 --> 47:33.783
- Only if a person
who killed Kara

47:33.784 --> 47:36.921
was at the ceremony can a
demon like this be released.

47:36.922 --> 47:38.722
And it needs a body.

47:38.723 --> 47:39.856
- A host.

47:39.857 --> 47:40.857
- Yeah.

47:45.964 --> 47:47.364
- Dan die,

47:47.365 --> 47:48.633
kyuryum go out.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.468
Into new body.

47:51.469 --> 47:52.469
You.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.305
Or you.

47:55.306 --> 47:56.306
Or you.

47:56.307 --> 47:58.909
- It can possess anybody.

47:58.910 --> 48:02.413
Apart from the person whose
evil helped to form it.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.585
- Only this killer safe.

48:09.254 --> 48:11.288
- Come the fuck on, bro.

48:11.289 --> 48:13.157
- I told you all
it wasn't Brandon.

48:13.158 --> 48:15.259
This half.

48:15.260 --> 48:17.494
Yeah? That's not really
grounds for an appeal.

48:17.495 --> 48:19.529
- You don't understand
this culture, okay?

48:19.530 --> 48:21.131
The power that these
entities have.

48:21.132 --> 48:23.600
- Dan had some sort of
psychotic breakdown.

48:23.601 --> 48:25.435
- No, no, no, no.

48:25.436 --> 48:26.937
- The altitude, no sleep.

48:26.938 --> 48:28.938
- Hey guys, maybe he just had a trauma.
Reliving...

48:28.962 --> 48:30.107
- This truth!

48:30.108 --> 48:31.308
Truth!

48:31.309 --> 48:32.589
- The truth is
that you're lying.

48:32.590 --> 48:33.558
Okay, I don't know why yet

48:33.559 --> 48:34.844
but our friend's dying

48:34.845 --> 48:36.446
while you're fucking
wasting time.

48:36.447 --> 48:38.449
- We gotta get to a car.

48:40.218 --> 48:41.218
You have one?

48:41.219 --> 48:42.820
- Sergei.

48:45.256 --> 48:46.824
- It's in the shed.

48:47.858 --> 48:49.927
Take the path along the graves.

48:51.030 --> 48:52.030
- Yeah, I do.

48:52.031 --> 48:53.663
- Okay, you two go get the car.

48:53.664 --> 48:55.065
Hey,

48:55.066 --> 48:57.201
you're not running things here!

48:57.202 --> 48:58.736
Understand?!

49:44.582 --> 49:46.617
- The keys are inside.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.487
Is that a?

49:50.488 --> 49:52.890
- Yeah, bro, that's a coffin.

50:05.470 --> 50:07.438
!

50:12.577 --> 50:13.577
Hey!

50:14.445 --> 50:15.613
Speak English!

50:20.551 --> 50:23.520
- You cannot take
Dan to hospital.

50:23.521 --> 50:24.988
Listen, listen, listen,

50:24.989 --> 50:28.293
because if you do, kyuyum is
going to escape into the world.

50:29.794 --> 50:31.529
Maybe you didn't
get the message...

50:33.198 --> 50:34.431
- Mike!

50:34.432 --> 50:36.072
- So Piotr wants us to
just watch Dan die?

50:36.096 --> 50:37.901
- Step back. Please.

50:37.902 --> 50:38.836
Just hear us out.

50:38.837 --> 50:41.238
- We destroy demon.

50:41.239 --> 50:42.472
And save Dan.

50:42.473 --> 50:45.110
- And how are we
supposed to do that?

50:50.348 --> 50:51.915
- Okay, there are two
ways of doing it.

50:51.916 --> 50:56.153
First, Kara's murderer has
to confess to killing her.

50:56.154 --> 50:57.994
And then Piotr's going
to perform a ceremony...

50:58.018 --> 51:00.224
- Yeah, cause it worked so well

51:00.225 --> 51:01.926
the last time, right?

51:06.964 --> 51:08.966
- We must kill murderer.

51:10.268 --> 51:12.402
This person die,

51:12.403 --> 51:13.403
demon die.

51:22.480 --> 51:25.483
- So you're talking
about one of us?

51:27.652 --> 51:28.652
- Yes.

51:33.791 --> 51:34.959
But right one.

51:41.666 --> 51:43.233
- Eric, bro,

51:43.234 --> 51:44.868
if there's a dead body in here,

51:44.869 --> 51:48.806
I'm gonna run crying down
the fucking mountain.

51:59.817 --> 52:00.818
Joder, tio...

52:04.522 --> 52:06.623
You know maybe they're right.

52:06.624 --> 52:08.057
Maybe they, they use this coffin

52:08.058 --> 52:10.894
to bury some more of those
crazy fucking dolls.

52:10.895 --> 52:14.465
- Or maybe they knew
they'd be needing one.

52:15.400 --> 52:16.866
- Listen, listen.

52:16.867 --> 52:19.936
The murderer has to
confess to killing Kara.

52:19.937 --> 52:22.840
- What if this
person, this killer,

52:24.642 --> 52:26.377
doesn't come forward?

52:29.113 --> 52:31.233
- Then our friend, Piotr's,
gonna have to take matters

52:31.257 --> 52:32.682
into his own hands.

52:32.683 --> 52:33.683
Aren't you?

52:35.019 --> 52:37.259
Take your best guess at which
one of us you think did it?

52:37.655 --> 52:38.655
Fuck!

52:41.626 --> 52:43.527
- Move! Move!

52:43.528 --> 52:44.528
- Oh my God.

52:51.802 --> 52:52.870
- Piotr asks,

52:54.104 --> 52:57.308
he says we gotta get
Tony and Eric back.

52:58.743 --> 53:00.644
And we gotta tie everyone up.

53:00.645 --> 53:02.145
- What the fuck is
he talking about?

53:02.146 --> 53:04.180
- Kyuryum, the demon, can
enter either one of us.

53:04.181 --> 53:05.949
- I've got to get to Eric!
He doesn't know!

53:05.950 --> 53:07.017
- No, you stay!

53:08.387 --> 53:09.387
- Two minutes.

53:09.387 --> 53:10.321
Five.

53:10.322 --> 53:11.821
- If all of us are tied up,

53:11.822 --> 53:13.991
Piotr can find out which one
of us turns and then...

53:15.493 --> 53:17.573
You're just gonna tie us up
and then kill one of us?!

53:17.597 --> 53:18.695
- Not kill. Stop!

53:18.696 --> 53:21.398
- It gives the person who
killed Kara more time to...

53:21.399 --> 53:23.567
- Admit what they did and
to perform the ceremony.

53:23.568 --> 53:24.802
We have to do this!

53:25.703 --> 53:27.371
Wo, wo, wo, wo!

53:27.372 --> 53:29.039
- Hey, back the fuck off of her!

53:29.974 --> 53:31.676
- Hey, stop, stop stop, stop!

53:36.947 --> 53:38.448
- Calm down!

53:38.449 --> 53:41.351
- These are dark fucking
forces we're dealing with!

53:41.352 --> 53:43.687
I've spent my life studying
rituals like this!

53:43.688 --> 53:44.988
Omens, the occult...

53:44.989 --> 53:46.623
- Forgive us if
we don't view you

53:46.624 --> 53:49.059
as a beacon of fucking truth.

53:50.428 --> 53:53.697
What if Piotr, here,
thinks that we are all in

53:53.698 --> 53:55.099
on Kara's murder?

53:56.734 --> 54:00.470
What if he is tying us up
so he can kill all of us?

54:00.471 --> 54:03.874
What if that's the
reason why we're here?

54:05.476 --> 54:07.277
What if that's the
reason why there are

54:07.278 --> 54:09.913
fucking graves out
in the forest?!

54:09.914 --> 54:11.981
- You can't make decisions
based on paranoia!

54:11.982 --> 54:15.285
- We should base them on
your superstitious bullshit?

54:15.286 --> 54:18.322
- If you're wrong, we all die!

54:18.323 --> 54:20.624
- But if you're wrong,
we still die, right?

54:20.625 --> 54:22.893
- I'm not wrong, goddammit!

54:24.261 --> 54:26.496
- You were all there the night
that Kara was murdered.

54:26.497 --> 54:28.057
- So now you think it
was one of us too?

54:28.081 --> 54:30.467
- I don't know what to think!

54:30.468 --> 54:32.168
- Peter was the
one who performed

54:32.169 --> 54:36.072
this fucked-up ceremony
that possessed Dan, right?

54:36.073 --> 54:37.173
- If you believe that.

54:37.174 --> 54:38.108
- I don't believe it!

54:38.109 --> 54:39.509
But let's just say it's true.

54:39.510 --> 54:41.478
Afterwards, Dan
tried to kill you.

54:41.479 --> 54:42.679
And Sandra.

54:42.680 --> 54:43.814
- And now Dan's dead.

54:47.652 --> 54:50.588
Over your own fucking friends?

54:52.089 --> 54:54.209
What do you mean, Brandon's
friends or Kara's friends?

54:54.233 --> 54:57.093
But what if that's
not what you are?

54:57.094 --> 54:58.227
- We tie now!

54:58.228 --> 54:59.129
- Shut

54:59.130 --> 55:00.497
the fuck

55:00.498 --> 55:01.498
up!

55:02.533 --> 55:04.602
They are strangers to us!

55:07.071 --> 55:11.275
Who is gonna let a
stranger tie them up?!

55:15.045 --> 55:16.413
- Da.

55:16.414 --> 55:18.281
- So we could all be tied up

55:18.282 --> 55:20.650
and the only one who's loose
is the one who's possessed,

55:20.651 --> 55:22.119
is that right?

55:27.592 --> 55:29.660
- Maybe we use the coffin.

55:30.761 --> 55:32.430
- To put Dan inside.

55:40.971 --> 55:42.811
Keep him from rolling
around the back of the...

56:52.810 --> 56:54.330
- Piotr is the only
one who can perform

56:54.331 --> 56:55.531
the purification ceremony.

56:55.532 --> 56:56.746
Guys, understand this.

56:56.747 --> 56:58.682
He has to be free!

56:58.683 --> 57:00.584
It's just simply a
chance we have to take.

57:00.585 --> 57:02.418
- No, we don't!

57:02.419 --> 57:03.753
- No way.

57:03.754 --> 57:07.024
- Maybe there's a reason
you don't want to do it.

57:09.126 --> 57:12.930
And what's that? You
think I killed Kara?

57:17.935 --> 57:19.615
- You ever think maybe
I just don't want to

57:19.639 --> 57:21.738
a fucking ax through my head?

57:21.739 --> 57:23.873
Or be fucking tied up
and watch it happen

57:23.874 --> 57:25.610
to all of you first?!

58:07.151 --> 58:08.618
- Two minutes. Five minutes.

58:08.619 --> 58:12.722
Either way, nothing's
happened so you're wrong.

58:12.723 --> 58:13.923
You know what?

58:13.924 --> 58:15.284
I'm taking that car
and I'm leaving

58:15.308 --> 58:18.912
with whoever the fuck
wants to come with me.

58:20.264 --> 58:21.565
It's now or never.

58:21.566 --> 58:22.833
Fucking decide.

58:24.535 --> 58:25.535
- Whoa! Whoa!

58:30.908 --> 58:33.410
- Man with gun running things.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.080
Understand?

58:40.017 --> 58:41.484
Understand?

58:41.485 --> 58:42.485
- Yes.

58:43.354 --> 58:44.354
Yeah.

58:44.354 --> 58:45.354
- Say!

58:47.491 --> 58:48.726
- I understand!

59:23.794 --> 59:26.396
- He told me to protect myself.

59:29.299 --> 59:32.569
- Do I have permission
to get some air?

01:00:08.405 --> 01:00:12.776
- Okay, I wanted to show you
before I showed anyone else.

01:00:12.777 --> 01:00:13.777
Ready? No, don't peek.

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.714
Okay, you can look.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:22.953
I just um...

01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:26.891
I never want to lose her.

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:31.829
That's what you do when
you love someone, right?

01:00:37.902 --> 01:00:39.236
I'm asking Kara tomorrow.

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:49.947
- They're bringing out the cake.

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:17.886
- Guys, guys, guys,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:20.109
Kara, in honor of your birthday,

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:22.045
I wrote a small speech.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:24.048
And it's from the heart.

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:27.785
Let's fucking party like
there's no tomorrow.

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:02.752
- No, just Kara and...

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:04.854
I get to decide what I want.

01:02:04.855 --> 01:02:06.590
I'm with Brandon now.

01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:09.959
You need to leave me alone.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.795
Kara!

01:02:10.796 --> 01:02:12.362
Right now!

01:02:21.406 --> 01:02:22.406
I don't want it!

01:02:22.407 --> 01:02:24.273
- No, I guess not.

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:26.676
Just leave me alone!

01:02:30.281 --> 01:02:31.281
Kara!

01:02:31.282 --> 01:02:32.515
- I'm gonna go tell Brandon.

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:34.750
- No, Alice, you
know how he gets.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:35.985
Alice!

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:38.087
Alice, you'd better come.

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.956
I'm afraid Mike's gonna
try to rush Sergei.

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:41.291
Try to get his gun.

01:02:43.961 --> 01:02:46.695
- Your friend Peter,
he's a fraud, isn't he?

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:48.498
- Of course he is.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.935
- I think to us that word means

01:02:51.936 --> 01:02:53.456
something different
than to all of you.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.304
- Whatever the fuck
you wanna call him,

01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:57.206
this ceremony, chanting,

01:02:57.207 --> 01:03:00.143
this demon, it's all just
a bunch of fucking...

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:01.045
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:01.046 --> 01:03:02.378
You did see.

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:04.613
Kara's Itterma doll
levitate, didn't you?

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.182
- Yeah, we all did.

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:08.051
And I also saw

01:03:08.052 --> 01:03:12.388
a woman sawed in half at a
magic show in Las Vegas.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:14.558
- The Altai call it dyula.

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:17.293
It's a sickly soul.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.728
- Yeah, you have some
experience with that?

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:21.164
- Now by the time
you all figure out

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:23.900
what you're dealing with here,
it's gonna be too late.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.334
- Is that what you
think, Sergei?

01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:26.636
It's gonna be too late for us?

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:30.139
Mike?

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.140
Don't.

01:03:32.609 --> 01:03:36.646
- I think she's trying to tell
you not to get yourself shot.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.964
- All we have to
do is figure out

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:30.866
which one of us
killed Kara, right?

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:33.037
Well, I can tell you that.

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:43.546
- Well, don't look so
nervous, professor.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:44.827
I think you're a fucking bastard

01:04:44.851 --> 01:04:47.154
but I don't think you did it.

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:51.487
- Your brother.

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:52.488
Brandon.

01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:56.525
Because he was the
only who was convicted

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:57.826
by a jury of his peers.

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.662
And he's rotting for
it in prison right now

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:02.798
while Kara's rotting out
in their fucking woods.

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:03.866
- Brandon didn't.

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:05.868
- Of course he did, Alice.

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:07.103
Okay, we get it.

01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:08.584
Growing up, all you
had was each other

01:05:08.585 --> 01:05:09.865
but sometimes the
people we love,

01:05:09.889 --> 01:05:12.145
they do horrible fucking shit.

01:05:57.887 --> 01:05:59.522
- I did tell you you
not to tell Brandon

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:01.390
about the argument we overheard.

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:03.492
We all knew what he was
like when he was jealous.

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:06.495
- I told Brandon because Rez
was fucking terrifying her.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.631
- I was the last person
that she was afraid of.

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:11.001
And I wasn't even in the
room with her that night.

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:13.269
- I was.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.807
Helen told me Brandon
was gonna propose.

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:21.345
I told Kara to say no.

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:25.281
Maybe that's why she's dead.

01:06:25.282 --> 01:06:26.549
Because she did.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.684
- But I saw blood
on Rez's hands.

01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:31.687
- That's because Brandon
punched me so hard

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.189
that he broke my nose.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:35.424
Don't you think that an
insane jealousy like that

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:36.959
can drive someone to murder?

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.962
- So stop blaming everyone
else for what happened.

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:42.398
Kara is dead because
of your brother

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:44.400
and because of the
decisions that you made.

01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:46.169
- You and Rez just want
Brandon to be guilty

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:47.670
because you're both
in love with Kara

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.305
and she didn't choose
either one of you.

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:50.573
- No, she didn't choose us!

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:53.209
And look where the
fuck that got her!

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:54.210
- Jesus.

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:16.232
- Okay, you can
stop this whole lie

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:19.735
and just tell us why
the fuck we're here.

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:24.140
- Do you think this world
is only what you can see?

01:07:24.141 --> 01:07:26.175
As children, Kara wanted
to travel the world

01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:28.377
and Piotr went to study
from our best shamans

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:31.947
to understand the world
that we cannot see.

01:07:31.948 --> 01:07:35.050
So when Piotr tell me
that kyuryum, the demon,

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.786
is inside one of you,

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:41.057
it's as real to me as this gun.

01:07:43.127 --> 01:07:46.562
- Sergei, they don't
understand this culture.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:47.631
- But you do.

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:49.732
You do.

01:07:51.268 --> 01:07:53.337
With your field research?

01:07:54.238 --> 01:07:56.472
You understand our grief?

01:07:56.473 --> 01:08:01.009
You understand what makes our
mountain roads slippery?

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:02.011
- I don't...

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:08.385
It never turned.

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:12.956
It drove straight off
the mountain cliff.

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:19.295
So whichever one of you
put the knife in Kara,

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:21.365
you killed them too.

01:08:38.515 --> 01:08:39.515
- You win.

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:43.719
No rope.

01:08:44.388 --> 01:08:45.555
Everyone free.

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:48.492
Now your friend dead.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:53.261
- Eric.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.032
Eric killed Tony.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.170
Alice,

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:04.908
Alice, find out which one of
these bastards killed Kara.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:13.716
- Car dead.

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:19.356
- You destroyed our
only way out of here?

01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:22.225
Or need...

01:09:24.228 --> 01:09:25.228
Proof?

01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:28.332
- Oh, fuck.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.502
- What Eric do to your friend!

01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:19.114
- Kyuryum, the demon is
taunting us with a message.

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:22.351
- You mean the burns on the
floor from Kara's Itterma doll?

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:23.752
- Yeah, and with the writing...

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:25.454
- In blood.

01:10:25.455 --> 01:10:26.989
- It wants to be released.

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:29.150
It's trying to get out into
the city, into the country.

01:10:29.174 --> 01:10:30.526
- To world.

01:10:30.527 --> 01:10:32.028
- To keep killing.

01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:37.534
- Sergei, Sandra.

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.215
- You need to go.

01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:57.152
Okay.

01:10:58.822 --> 01:11:00.856
Get to the bottom
of the mountain.

01:11:00.857 --> 01:11:01.991
Get to people.

01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:09.032
Anyone want to
make a confession?

01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:11.133
Anybody?

01:11:15.639 --> 01:11:17.673
No.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:19.742
Do we draw straws to figure out

01:11:19.743 --> 01:11:21.444
which one of us we kill first?

01:11:21.445 --> 01:11:22.278
- Rez.

01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:23.512
- No!

01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:25.714
We kill somebody, we
save Eric, right?

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:28.016
We take a life, we save a life.

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:30.920
And we know that
Eric didn't do it.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:40.228
How about you first professor?
You're deserving.

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:42.297
- Maybe it should be you.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:45.068
You don't want to
be here anyway.

01:11:46.169 --> 01:11:47.903
How many times you try suicide?

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:50.005
- Not enough, obviously.

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:52.575
- Maybe you're just
not good at it.

01:11:52.576 --> 01:11:54.309
A failure at even that.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:55.878
- Yeah, fuck yeah. That's it.

01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:56.912
That's you.

01:11:56.913 --> 01:11:57.913
That's the real you.

01:11:57.914 --> 01:11:59.549
Now we're having a conversation.

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:12.396
- No one can leave.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.031
- Piotr said.

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:17.800
He said that

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:19.201
the person who's possessed

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:21.604
won't try to kill
Kara's murderer.

01:12:21.605 --> 01:12:23.005
But Dan tried to
kill Alice and me.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:27.010
So you know, you know I
didn't do it, don't you?

01:12:28.412 --> 01:12:31.947
Look, Eric will probably be
dead before I find help,

01:12:31.948 --> 01:12:35.619
but I can't live with
myself if I don't try.

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:39.622
So if you're gonna shoot me,

01:12:39.623 --> 01:12:42.291
you can put a bullet in my back.

01:12:54.738 --> 01:12:55.938
- Why do you go to a party

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:57.540
with a bunch of twenty year Hm?

01:12:57.541 --> 01:12:58.674
And why are you here?

01:12:58.675 --> 01:13:00.242
- Kara was my student.

01:13:00.243 --> 01:13:01.677
She was my best student.

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:03.679
And she was my friend.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.415
Like the rest of you.

01:13:07.951 --> 01:13:09.384
- Her trusted mentor.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.789
And you just loved her
beautiful culture.

01:13:14.157 --> 01:13:16.091
- Look, we have to focus.

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:17.760
There's a killer out there.

01:13:17.761 --> 01:13:20.363
- There's a killer in here too.

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:28.404
- Oh God.

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:41.049
- We start falling apart,
we're not gonna make it.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.987
I'm so fucking exhausted.

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:48.524
- Okay, this needs
to be the focus.

01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:49.725
Here.

01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:51.761
Which one of us
really killed Kara?

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:55.030
- You fuck.

01:14:15.084 --> 01:14:16.920
- Stay close together.

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:31.734
Why is he breaking windows?

01:14:31.735 --> 01:14:34.070
- He's trying to confuse us.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.072
To divide us.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:17.140
- He stopped.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:35.524
- I don't know.

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.096
- We need weapons.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.874
Everyone grab something.

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:54.209
An ax, a hammer, a
fucking shovel.

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:55.711
A hammer and a fucking shovel.

01:16:55.712 --> 01:16:57.714
- Stop. Mike, just stop!

01:16:58.749 --> 01:16:59.749
- What the fuck are
you laughing at, Rez?

01:16:59.749 --> 01:17:00.684
- Sergei's got a gun.

01:17:00.685 --> 01:17:01.884
And we shoot Eric?

01:17:01.885 --> 01:17:03.385
- You're goddam right
we shoot Eric.

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:04.720
And who's possessed next
after we shoot Eric?

01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:05.588
He's right. If we
shoot kill Eric,

01:17:05.589 --> 01:17:06.855
another one of us turns.

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:08.123
We gotta, we gotta
fucking catch him.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.324
How're we supposed to do that?

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:10.765
Why don't we dig a
hols in the middle

01:17:10.789 --> 01:17:12.429
of the fucking room,
cover it with sticks?

01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:23.606
- Go! Go! Go!

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.826
- Shut the door!

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:51.901
- Shut the fucking door!

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:03.979
- Oh fuck.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:07.950
Coffins.

01:18:07.951 --> 01:18:10.686
There's eight of them.
One for each of us.

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:34.977
- Give me the gun.

01:18:34.978 --> 01:18:36.913
- No. I don't think so.

01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:41.216
- I gotta find the girls, Rez!

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.486
- Give him the fucking gun!

01:18:44.821 --> 01:18:46.422
- I don't think so.

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:56.198
- Please be quiet.

01:18:56.199 --> 01:18:58.101
Please, please, please.

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:04.240
- I think that's me.

01:19:05.641 --> 01:19:09.312
- These are the dolls that
they're gonna bury with Kara.

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:15.952
- It's Mike.

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:19.422
- That's me.

01:19:20.323 --> 01:19:22.557
Wait, look at the clothes.

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:24.392
This is what I wore
the night Kara died.

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:26.061
What we all wore.

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:28.864
- That's what we're
gonna be soon.

01:19:28.865 --> 01:19:29.865
Lifeless.

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:32.434
Dead eyes.

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:41.644
- Stop screaming!
Stop screaming!

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:44.713
Stop screaming!

01:19:50.686 --> 01:19:51.686
- Oh, jeez.

01:19:53.256 --> 01:19:54.256
Ah, okay.

01:19:55.892 --> 01:19:56.892
No! No! No!

01:20:11.674 --> 01:20:12.674
No!

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:19.648
- No, no, no, no, Helen.

01:20:19.649 --> 01:20:20.916
Helen, be quiet.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:22.651
Be quiet. Be quiet.

01:20:25.922 --> 01:20:27.222
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:29.926
No, no, no, no, no. Helen.

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:34.097
Please be quiet.

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:42.037
Helen, Helen. We gotta go!

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:43.139
We gotta go!

01:21:20.143 --> 01:21:21.577
Help! Help! Help!

01:21:23.246 --> 01:21:24.246
Help!

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:34.669
Let us in! Let us in! Let us in!

01:21:41.164 --> 01:21:43.933
- Lock the door! Lock the door!

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:00.316
- Piotr shot him.

01:22:01.884 --> 01:22:02.884
- No.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:06.589
- It's okay.

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:08.456
- Please!

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:14.563
Please! Please! Please!

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:40.689
- Choices have to be made.

01:22:43.726 --> 01:22:45.893
What do you mean choices?

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:47.997
- Or we're all gonna die.

01:22:50.433 --> 01:22:54.137
- Don't you do
something stupid, Rez.

01:22:59.742 --> 01:23:00.843
Punch someone?

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:04.813
Slap someone?

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:08.517
Shoot someone?

01:23:15.211 --> 01:23:16.691
You know, a few days
before Kara died,

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:19.627
she called me to come pick
her up at this house.

01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:21.263
Couldn't even walk.

01:23:21.264 --> 01:23:22.264
Dress torn.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.401
Someone had slipped
something into her drink

01:23:26.402 --> 01:23:28.970
and she just managed
to get out of there.

01:23:28.971 --> 01:23:31.239
And she asked my advice.

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:35.411
"Um, should I uninvite this
person to my birthday party?"

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:39.547
"Should I press charges?"

01:23:39.548 --> 01:23:41.617
"Should I file a report?"

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.420
Now you,

01:23:49.225 --> 01:23:51.626
you would probably want to
stop something like that

01:23:51.627 --> 01:23:54.630
from happening, wouldn't
you, professor?

01:23:55.798 --> 01:23:56.798
- Nothing.

01:23:57.401 --> 01:23:58.401
- No!

01:23:58.402 --> 01:24:00.668
- You see, the thing is

01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:03.839
that not all secrets
go to the grave.

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:14.810
- Okay. Okay.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:22.617
Oh, jeez.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:25.220
Okay.

01:25:26.222 --> 01:25:27.655
Okay.

01:25:27.656 --> 01:25:30.058
- There were plenty of girls.

01:25:31.994 --> 01:25:34.362
Plenty of girls who
woke up in your bed,

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:36.732
not remembering what happened,
weren't there, professor?

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:39.566
- He's fucking crazy!
Look at his wrists!

01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:40.657
- Yeah, look!

01:25:42.037 --> 01:25:44.772
Look what I did to myself!

01:25:44.773 --> 01:25:45.773
Look!

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.044
But it's not me who is sick.

01:25:50.045 --> 01:25:52.079
It is you! It is you!

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.916
It is people like you!

01:25:57.586 --> 01:25:59.921
- I didn't kill Kara.

01:25:59.922 --> 01:26:01.889
- Maybe you did.

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:03.292
Maybe you didn't.

01:26:04.627 --> 01:26:06.462
You did enough though.

01:26:08.731 --> 01:26:10.165
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:13.602
- Give me the gun Rez!

01:26:14.437 --> 01:26:15.937
- No, no, no, no!

01:26:15.938 --> 01:26:18.374
This does not end unless
we end it here and now.

01:26:19.308 --> 01:26:20.408
Shoot the fucking door!

01:26:20.409 --> 01:26:21.576
- Stop!

01:26:21.577 --> 01:26:23.177
The person on the other
side of that door

01:26:23.201 --> 01:26:25.361
is just paying the price for
what one of us did, right?

01:26:25.981 --> 01:26:27.315
- Shoot the goddam door!

01:26:27.316 --> 01:26:29.951
Shoot the door?

01:26:29.952 --> 01:26:31.553
Shoot the door

01:26:31.554 --> 01:26:33.187
or someone else?

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:35.224
- No, no, no, Rez.

01:26:38.461 --> 01:26:39.627
- Yeah.

01:26:39.628 --> 01:26:41.529
Yeah. It's what you want!

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:44.932
- What the fuck are
you talking about?!

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.200
- Pull the trigger.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:48.103
Just pull the trigger man!

01:26:49.171 --> 01:26:50.739
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:26:52.475 --> 01:26:55.611
Wait, Kara's sending a message.

01:26:58.447 --> 01:27:00.416
- Rez, you listen to me,

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:03.986
before you get us all killed.

01:27:06.655 --> 01:27:08.491
- Shut the fuck up, Jeff!

01:27:11.994 --> 01:27:13.929
- Kara's spoken.

01:27:15.798 --> 01:27:16.798
- No!

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.815
- You know, you were right.

01:27:33.816 --> 01:27:36.385
I was not very good at suicide.

01:27:37.886 --> 01:27:40.221
But it broke my heart
when Kara was killed

01:27:40.222 --> 01:27:43.592
and now I get to do
something about it.

01:29:30.232 --> 01:29:32.468
- We gotta get out of here.

01:29:33.502 --> 01:29:36.071
Make our way down the mountain.

01:29:42.711 --> 01:29:43.711
Go! Go! Go!

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:46.715
Now, now, now, go!

01:29:55.458 --> 01:29:56.824
You okay?

01:29:56.825 --> 01:29:58.092
Come on, baby.

01:29:58.093 --> 01:29:59.093
Come on.

01:30:06.002 --> 01:30:07.002
Fuck.

01:30:07.002 --> 01:30:08.002
Oh, fuck.

01:30:09.638 --> 01:30:11.238
Go! Go! Go back!

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.507
Go back! Go back!

01:30:12.508 --> 01:30:13.508
Go back!

01:30:18.714 --> 01:30:19.714
- Oh God.

01:30:58.587 --> 01:30:59.587
- Helen,

01:31:02.158 --> 01:31:03.158
give me the gun.

01:31:03.159 --> 01:31:04.493
- Don't do it.

01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:09.163
- Give me the gun.

01:31:09.164 --> 01:31:10.397
We need to shoot Alice.

01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:11.566
- Helen, no.

01:31:11.567 --> 01:31:12.967
- It's Alice, Helen.

01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:14.602
She's the one that killed Kara.

01:31:14.603 --> 01:31:15.703
- He's lying.

01:31:15.704 --> 01:31:17.705
- She's the only one left.

01:31:17.706 --> 01:31:19.774
- My brother is in
jail for Kara's murder

01:31:19.775 --> 01:31:22.043
and you know how
much I loved him,

01:31:22.044 --> 01:31:23.778
that I would do
anything for him.

01:31:23.779 --> 01:31:25.312
- She's trying to
manipulate you.

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:27.749
- You saw Eric try
and kill both of us!

01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:29.884
I can't be Kara's murderer!

01:31:29.885 --> 01:31:31.152
- Stop! All of you!

01:31:31.153 --> 01:31:32.755
- Goddam it, you fucking bitch!

01:31:34.089 --> 01:31:35.757
- Mike, stop or I'll shoot you!

01:31:35.758 --> 01:31:38.359
- Helen, you shoot me,
you turn into the demon.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.761
You get that?

01:31:39.762 --> 01:31:42.229
There's no fucking time!

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:43.364
- Helen,

01:31:43.365 --> 01:31:45.499
Helen, if Mike
couldn't be with Kara,

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:49.003
he didn't want
anyone else to be.

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:50.172
You know that.

01:31:52.641 --> 01:31:54.743
You know it. You know it.

01:31:55.711 --> 01:31:56.778
- Trust me.

01:31:56.779 --> 01:31:57.613
- You know it.

01:31:57.614 --> 01:31:58.781
Baby, it's me.

01:32:00.716 --> 01:32:03.351
- All I wanted was
to be with you!

01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.060
- You don't know what you're...

01:32:13.328 --> 01:32:15.230
- I got you. I got you.

01:32:16.665 --> 01:32:18.600
Oh, you did the right thing.

01:32:18.601 --> 01:32:20.603
You did the right thing.

01:33:03.278 --> 01:33:06.181
- Everyone knew
Brandon's jealousy.

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:12.955
I knew they'd all accuse him.

01:33:21.396 --> 01:33:23.131
He was gonna leave me

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:27.035
and start another life.

01:33:28.503 --> 01:33:30.906
But now he'll always need me.

01:33:36.211 --> 01:33:38.814
I just didn't want to lose him.

01:33:40.515 --> 01:33:44.687

you love someone, right?
