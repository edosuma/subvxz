WEBVTT

01:29.190 --> 01:31.070
For as much as it hath pleased.

01:31.150 --> 01:33.780
Almighty God of His great mercy

01:33.860 --> 01:36.580
to take onto Himself the soul...

01:36.660 --> 01:39.870
of our dear sister
here departed.

01:39.950 --> 01:42.910
We therefore commit her body
to the ground...

01:42.990 --> 01:46.750
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

01:46.840 --> 01:50.760
dust to dust,
in sure and certain hope

01:50.840 --> 01:53.510
of the resurrection
to eternal life...

01:53.590 --> 01:56.260
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

01:56.340 --> 01:58.720
who shall change our vile body,

01:58.800 --> 02:01.980
that it may be like
unto his glorious body,

02:02.060 --> 02:04.480
according to the mighty working,

02:04.560 --> 02:09.729
whereby he is able to subdue
all things to Himself.

02:15.820 --> 02:17.360
Rest in peace.

02:40.470 --> 02:44.020
- Amber, get in the car.
- I am not getting in the car!

02:44.100 --> 02:45.680
Amber, do you have
to do this today?

02:45.770 --> 02:48.860
- No, I'm not getting in! No!
- Get in the car, please.

02:48.940 --> 02:51.230
- Amber, get in the car.
- Whatever.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.270
Henry Gangon's studio.

03:37.110 --> 03:39.160
- Ah, yeah.
- Henry, it's Josephine.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.200
Okay. One second, one second.
One more.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.870
Jesus Christ!
Okay, hang on.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.040
Josephine.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.750
Hey, Josephine.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.500
Hi, Henry.

03:55.590 --> 03:57.590
Yeah, I should've
come with you.

03:57.670 --> 03:58.670
I'm alright.

03:58.720 --> 04:02.680
Uh, I... I'll meet you in Paris.

04:02.760 --> 04:07.310
I just have to go to
the reading of the will tomorrow

04:07.390 --> 04:10.140
and, um,
take care of things here

04:10.230 --> 04:13.110
once I know what's what.

04:13.190 --> 04:14.210
Look, if this takes
more than a week,

04:14.230 --> 04:16.690
I'm comin' up there, okay?

04:16.779 --> 04:18.649
You've been looking after me
for 23 years

04:18.740 --> 04:21.820
you're more than an assistant,
you're my best friend.

04:21.910 --> 04:24.830
That's very kind.

04:24.910 --> 04:28.540
- Josephine, I do have to go.
- Okay.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.710
I will call you tomorrow, okay?

04:39.590 --> 04:41.970
Josephine Malone.
Terry Baginski.

04:42.050 --> 04:44.140
I'm stepping in for Arnie today.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.770
Mr. Spear is late,
which isn't a surprise.

04:49.850 --> 04:51.850
Who is Mr. Spear?

04:51.940 --> 04:54.270
He's the other person mentioned
in your grandmother's will.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.670
Mr. Spear has arrived.

05:12.750 --> 05:13.750
- Terry?
- Oh...

05:13.790 --> 05:15.380
I'm sorry. A-are you alright?

05:15.460 --> 05:17.670
My apologies. Yes.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.920
- You're Josie.
- Josephine.

05:21.010 --> 05:25.100
Malone. Uh...
Lydia's, uh, granddaughter.

05:25.180 --> 05:27.260
I know.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.190
"I, Lydia Josephine Malone,

05:37.270 --> 05:38.940
"being of very sound mind

05:39.020 --> 05:41.070
"and knowingly questionable body

05:41.150 --> 05:43.660
"do hereby bequeath
all my worldly possessions

05:43.740 --> 05:47.030
"to my granddaughter,
Josephine Diana Malone.

05:47.120 --> 05:50.100
"This includes Lavender House
and my investment portfolio.

05:51.080 --> 05:55.710
"I bequeath everything
to Josephine but $150,000.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.090
"This will be provided
to Mr. James Marcum Spear

05:58.170 --> 06:00.260
"in order that he put it
in a trust.

06:00.340 --> 06:03.510
"Fifty thousand each
for Connor Marcum Spear,

06:03.590 --> 06:07.470
"Amber Jolan Spear
and Ethan James Spear.

06:07.550 --> 06:09.890
"And last,
my most prized possession,

06:09.970 --> 06:12.770
"the thing I treasure above
anything else in this world,

06:12.850 --> 06:15.730
"my granddaughter,
Josephine Diana Malone,

06:15.810 --> 06:18.650
I hereby bequeath
to James Marcum Spear."

06:18.730 --> 06:20.520
- What?
- What?

06:20.610 --> 06:22.820
"Jake, Josie is quite awkward
and I don't mean simply

06:22.900 --> 06:24.650
"that she is a complete klutz.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.740
"She doesn't know
how to enjoy herself.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.740
"But if you find your way
to coax it out of her,

06:28.820 --> 06:30.090
"she gives off
the sweetest light

06:30.120 --> 06:31.910
"that will ever shine on you.

06:31.990 --> 06:35.790
"I'm trusting you, my Jake,
to take good care of her.

06:35.870 --> 06:39.090
"These are my wishes
and I will them to be done.

06:39.170 --> 06:41.130
"If they're not, I'll know

06:41.210 --> 06:43.090
"and it'll make me very upset

06:43.170 --> 06:45.010
"I know neither of you
want that.

06:45.090 --> 06:48.800
Now, be blissfully happy,
my Josie and my Jake."

06:52.100 --> 06:54.770
Did Lydie just leave me
you in her will?

06:54.850 --> 06:59.270
Obviously, the bequeathal
of a human being isn't binding.

06:59.360 --> 07:03.030
Copies of Mrs. Malone's official
last will and testament.

07:03.110 --> 07:04.940
There's also contact information

07:05.030 --> 07:06.530
for Stone Incorporated.

07:06.610 --> 07:09.620
They're interested
in purchasing Lavender House.

07:18.620 --> 07:19.920
Although gran
didn't mention you,

07:20.000 --> 07:21.630
it's clear she held you
and your children

07:21.710 --> 07:22.750
in very high regard.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.420
So, it was a pleasure
to meet you.

07:25.510 --> 07:27.590
Goodbye.

07:28.260 --> 07:30.850
Wait. Hey, hey, hang on.
Josie, wait...

07:30.930 --> 07:33.220
- Mr. Spear, not to be rude...
- Jake.

07:33.310 --> 07:34.930
My name's Jake.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.660
Look, something big
just happened in here.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.730
Indeed, and if you're concerned,

07:38.810 --> 07:40.150
I'll take issue with the gifts

07:40.230 --> 07:41.860
my grandmother bestowed
on your children.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.580
- Please don't be.
- No, it's not what I'm saying.

07:43.610 --> 07:45.650
I'm talkin'
about the other gift, Josie.

07:45.740 --> 07:47.780
Nobody calls me Josie.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.950
Lydie did.

07:51.820 --> 07:53.580
Tonight, we need to have dinner.

07:53.660 --> 07:54.970
I'm afraid dinner
is out of the question.

07:55.050 --> 07:56.260
I see that you're trying
to pretend like

07:56.290 --> 07:59.330
that didn't just happen,
but it did happen.

07:59.420 --> 08:02.340
I mean, the least we could do is
get to know each other, right?

08:02.420 --> 08:04.590
Don't we owe her that respect?

08:04.670 --> 08:07.090
I mean, look, if I'm a dick,
then that's it.

08:07.170 --> 08:08.570
But I'm not gonna be a dick
to Lydie's girl,

08:08.590 --> 08:10.260
because that woman
meant a lot to me,

08:10.340 --> 08:12.970
and to my kids.

08:13.050 --> 08:14.560
When and where?

08:14.640 --> 08:16.980
Lobster Market, 6:30.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.140
I'll see you there.

08:21.310 --> 08:23.320
It's nice to finally meet you,
Josie.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.480
Uh, Josephine.

08:40.460 --> 08:42.789
May I join you?

08:42.880 --> 08:46.500
I wouldn't mind, but there's
a man in my life who would.

08:48.380 --> 08:50.470
Well, if I were that man,

08:50.550 --> 08:53.470
I would hate for you
to dine alone.

08:53.550 --> 08:55.470
Well, he's busy this evening

08:55.560 --> 08:58.350
and I had a craving
for lobster bisque, so...

09:02.770 --> 09:04.820
If you had a craving
for anything,

09:04.900 --> 09:07.070
I would make sure you got it.

09:07.150 --> 09:08.740
Actually, Jake knows
I'm quite capable

09:08.820 --> 09:11.530
of getting what I want
on my own.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.240
Jake?

09:13.320 --> 09:14.620
Jake Spear.

09:16.780 --> 09:19.080
What, you used to dance for him?

09:19.160 --> 09:20.370
What?

09:20.460 --> 09:22.370
Class piece.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.420
Looks like Jake's
finally learned to trade up.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.170
I beg your pardon?

09:26.250 --> 09:28.920
If you're lookin' to be
the fourth Mrs. Jake Spear,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.970
let me just tell you,
he might make a fortune

09:31.050 --> 09:33.430
from that strip club,

09:33.510 --> 09:35.430
but the Truck goes through women
like water.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.100
What the hell?

10:24.190 --> 10:27.480
You know, it's been a long time
since someone stood me up.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.250
If you had any idea
what it took to get Amber

10:29.270 --> 10:30.590
to babysit her brother
last night.

10:30.650 --> 10:32.610
How did you get in here?

10:32.690 --> 10:34.900
I have keys.
All the kids have keys.

10:34.990 --> 10:36.010
Ethan comes here after school.

10:36.030 --> 10:37.030
Well, I will have to ask

10:37.070 --> 10:39.120
for those to be returned.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.490
Seriously?

10:40.580 --> 10:41.800
Did my grandmother know
you own a strip club?

10:41.830 --> 10:43.620
Yeah, she did.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.250
Seeing as she lent me
the money to buy it.

10:46.330 --> 10:48.460
So your business

10:48.540 --> 10:51.050
is to objectify women?

10:51.130 --> 10:53.720
I see. So I'm an asshole?

10:53.800 --> 10:55.300
Alright. I didn't know that.

10:55.380 --> 10:56.800
Seeing as my least talented girl

10:56.880 --> 10:58.450
makes at least 500 a night,
on a slow night.

10:58.470 --> 11:00.470
I might be just a teensy bit
judgmental

11:00.560 --> 11:03.060
if she told me she was loaning
a man money to buy a strip club.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.020
A man who's been married
three times.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.810
Oh!

11:06.900 --> 11:09.610
Okay. You've been
askin' around about me.

11:09.690 --> 11:10.900
Lydie told me you were classy,

11:10.980 --> 11:12.400
didn't tell me
you were judgmental.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.900
You don't know me.

11:14.990 --> 11:17.070
I might know you
better than you think.

11:28.540 --> 11:30.630
Hm...

11:31.460 --> 11:33.670
Why didn't you tell me
about him, gran?

11:44.520 --> 11:46.560
Excuse me, I'm Boston Stone.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.230
CEO of Stone Incorporated.

11:48.310 --> 11:49.620
I don't wanna bother you,
except to ask

11:49.650 --> 11:51.110
if you'd like
to have lunch with me

11:51.190 --> 11:53.110
to discuss your plans
for the Lavender House.

11:53.190 --> 11:57.570
Um, my grandmother passed away
five days ago, and, um...

11:57.650 --> 11:59.240
There are a lot of things
on my mind,

11:59.320 --> 12:01.490
but not one of them
is discussing

12:01.580 --> 12:03.200
my plans for Lavender House.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.950
Of course.
I'm sorry for your loss.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.200
If you change your mind...

12:49.290 --> 12:51.370
Hm...

14:07.240 --> 14:10.790
- What'll it be?
- A club soda.

14:10.870 --> 14:14.960
And can someone tell Mr. Spear
that I'm here to see him?

14:43.110 --> 14:46.030
Mr. Spear is unavailable.
Can I give him a message?

14:46.110 --> 14:48.200
No, but thank you.

14:57.790 --> 15:00.840
Mr. Spear...
Uh, Jake...

15:00.920 --> 15:03.420
This is Josephine Malone
calling.

15:03.510 --> 15:06.840
Uh, I just wanted
the opportunity to apologize,

15:06.930 --> 15:11.720
and also, I just wanted the
chance to talk to you about...

15:11.810 --> 15:13.890
other things.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.190
Dammit!

15:30.370 --> 15:33.290
- Hello.
- Hello.

15:33.370 --> 15:34.930
I gotta tell you,
you really classed up the joint

15:34.960 --> 15:36.120
seeing you in there.

15:36.210 --> 15:38.040
- Oh, you saw me?
- Yeah, of course I did.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.100
We got cameras everywhere
just in case some drunk asshole

15:40.130 --> 15:42.210
gets out of line,
gotta take care of him.

15:44.090 --> 15:46.380
You, uh...
Somethin' you wanna say to me?

15:48.220 --> 15:49.800
I-I don't know
if you have consultants

15:49.890 --> 15:52.220
for this kinda thing,
but the brunette is gorgeous.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.020
Uh, with her skin tone, a deeper
auburn will suit her much better

15:55.100 --> 15:57.060
she'd make a fabulous redhead.

15:57.140 --> 15:59.100
And the blonde, she's so cute,
she just needs

15:59.190 --> 16:01.650
a manicure
and a keratin treatment.

16:01.730 --> 16:04.400
Okay. Ha-ha-ha!

16:04.480 --> 16:06.990
Oh, yeah. Lydie was right.
Adorable.

16:07.070 --> 16:10.120
- Sorry?
- Uh, nothin'. Um...

16:10.200 --> 16:12.580
Is that, is that the message
you had for me?

16:12.660 --> 16:16.120
I'd like for you to come
to dinner at Lavender House

16:16.200 --> 16:17.710
tomorrow night. Um...

16:17.790 --> 16:20.330
Gran clearly wanted us
to get to know each other

16:20.420 --> 16:23.460
and we should do that.

16:23.540 --> 16:25.840
Yeah.

16:27.260 --> 16:29.510
I'm just not sure
how she wanted us

16:29.590 --> 16:31.510
to get to know each other.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.310
Look, don't worry about it,
alright? You're not my type.

16:39.810 --> 16:43.980
I mean, I don't think
I was your type either.

16:44.060 --> 16:49.990
I-I don't understand
what gran wanted for you and me.

16:50.070 --> 16:53.280
I don't know,
but, I mean, maybe she...

16:53.370 --> 16:55.450
wanted you to know
you had a friend

16:55.540 --> 16:57.540
and still had at least
one person who cared.

16:57.620 --> 17:01.920
Well, that makes no sense.
She knew I had Henry.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.089
Yeah, I don't care what excuses
you make for that guy.

17:05.170 --> 17:07.410
He should've been with you
at your grandmother's funeral.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.480
Instead of letting you
stand there

17:08.510 --> 17:10.589
crying behind your shades alone.

17:13.260 --> 17:17.970
Well, you promise you're not
gonna ghost on me tomorrow,

17:18.060 --> 17:20.480
and I'll show,
but, uh, I gotta tell you

17:20.560 --> 17:23.900
I gotta bring Ethan with me.

17:23.980 --> 17:26.440
Alright, then.
Goodnight, Jake.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.610
Goodnight, Josephine.

17:29.690 --> 17:33.030
Hey, y-you can call me Josie.

17:34.490 --> 17:36.580
Goodnight, Josie.

17:45.750 --> 17:48.000
Um...

17:56.220 --> 17:57.350
- Hello.
- Hey.

17:57.430 --> 17:58.720
So, Amber got herself grounded

17:58.810 --> 18:00.430
two seconds
before we left the house,

18:00.520 --> 18:02.040
so if you don't have enough
food, I can order a pizza.

18:02.060 --> 18:04.860
- Or something.
- Oh, no, I have enough food.

18:04.940 --> 18:06.900
Hi, Amber, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

18:06.980 --> 18:09.070
Whatever.

18:10.030 --> 18:12.110
- Hello, Ethan.
- Hi.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.370
- Josie.
- Come on in.

18:17.450 --> 18:19.540
Okay.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.840
- It smells boss.
- Mm.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.590
Ooh. Yeah, it does.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.920
It smells like meat.
I'm a vegetarian.

18:31.010 --> 18:33.970
Ah, right.
She decided that this morning.

18:34.050 --> 18:35.800
Killing animals for food
is disgusting.

18:35.890 --> 18:39.850
How about killin' daughters
for bein' a pain in my ass?

18:39.930 --> 18:41.350
Crap! What is that?

18:41.430 --> 18:44.020
It's pavlova.
We're having it for dessert.

18:44.100 --> 18:47.900
I don't eat dessert.
My ass is already fat enough.

18:47.980 --> 18:50.070
Get me a beer, will ya, bud?

18:53.360 --> 18:55.200
Um, everything is done.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.950
I wasn't sure if he needed to
get home early to do homework...

18:58.030 --> 19:01.080
No, no. The, uh,
homework's in the truck.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.250
Alright. Dinner's ready.

19:10.130 --> 19:13.550
Rosemary meatloaf
with romesco sauce.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.840
Oh!

19:15.930 --> 19:18.140
- Don't you like meatloaf?
- No. Yeah. No, I do.

19:18.220 --> 19:19.930
I thought we were gonna
have to choke down

19:20.010 --> 19:22.350
coq au vin or something.

19:22.430 --> 19:24.100
Do you want some, Amber?

19:24.180 --> 19:26.240
I heard being vegetarian
is a good way to lose weight.

19:26.270 --> 19:27.870
I don't know why you'd be
worried about that.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.150
You have a perfect body.

19:30.230 --> 19:33.940
I don't know if my grandmother
told you, but I work in fashion.

19:34.030 --> 19:37.990
I hope you don't mind my saying,
but you're exceptionally pretty.

19:38.070 --> 19:41.120
Go a little less heavy
on the make-up.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.540
Jean Michel Duchamp taught me
how to do make-up.

19:44.620 --> 19:45.100
I have both of his books.

19:46.080 --> 19:49.170
My boss Henry shot the one
with the models.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.800
Oh, my God!
How did I not know that?

19:51.880 --> 19:53.150
Lydie told me that
you worked for Henry Gangon,

19:53.170 --> 19:54.460
I should've known that.

19:54.550 --> 19:56.020
If you want,
I could take your picture

19:56.050 --> 19:57.800
and ask him to share
some pointers.

19:57.880 --> 20:01.220
Are you freaking serious?
Oh, my freaking God.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.660
Dad, you have to lift the ban
on my cell phone

20:02.680 --> 20:04.600
so I can tell Taylor and Taylor
about this.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.850
- Who's Taylor and Taylor?
- Her best friends.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.310
Yeah, you can tell them
tomorrow.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.730
- Please, dad.
- Mm-hm.

20:09.810 --> 20:11.730
The easiest way to get
what you want

20:11.820 --> 20:13.520
is by listening to your father.

20:13.610 --> 20:14.980
Yeah, listen to your father

20:15.070 --> 20:17.240
when he's totally unreasonable
about Noah.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.990
- Who's Noah?
- My boyfriend.

20:19.070 --> 20:21.580
He wants to take me to a concert
and dad refuses to let me go.

20:21.660 --> 20:25.870
She used the F-word
like a bazillion times.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.550
Well, you're a beautiful girl

20:27.620 --> 20:30.420
and Noah could be
a paragon of virtue.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.710
But if your dad loves you,
it's his job to be cautious.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.170
If he didn't care,
that's when you should be upset.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.760
That's what Lydie would say.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.060
- To Lydie!
- Hey, to Lydie.

20:48.140 --> 20:50.230
To Lydie.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.320
Well, dinner was great, huh?

21:00.400 --> 21:02.490
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

21:03.820 --> 21:06.660
Boston Stone came by.

21:06.740 --> 21:08.500
He what?

21:08.580 --> 21:10.750
He's interested in buying
Lavender House.

21:10.830 --> 21:14.340
Yeah, but Lydie told him
to go jump in the Atlantic.

21:14.420 --> 21:16.840
And what did you say to Stone?

21:16.920 --> 21:20.300
I told him I wasn't prepared
to discuss it.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.800
Are you gonna get prepared?

21:22.890 --> 21:25.300
Nope.

21:25.390 --> 21:26.970
So you're keeping
Lavender House?

21:27.060 --> 21:30.060
Lydie said the only person
who loves Lavender House

21:30.140 --> 21:32.440
more than her is Josie,

21:32.520 --> 21:34.860
and that she'd never let it out
of the family.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.610
The only person who loves
Lavender House more than gran

21:39.690 --> 21:44.700
is me, and I'd never let it out
of the family, so...

21:44.780 --> 21:46.950
Yeah, I'm-I'm keeping the house.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.290
Yes!

21:49.370 --> 21:52.540
Hey, you go pour yourself
some wine, I got this.

22:08.810 --> 22:11.810
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Same.

22:11.890 --> 22:15.480
The food was freaking awesome!

22:17.980 --> 22:19.360
- It was a good night.
- Thanks.

22:19.440 --> 22:22.030
Thank you. Um...

22:22.110 --> 22:24.950
Tell you what, tomorrow,
9 a.m., meet me at The Shack.

22:25.030 --> 22:27.530
- The Shack?
- Yeah, The Shack, slick.

22:27.620 --> 22:28.760
Best seafood omelets in town.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.790
They're gonna knock you
on your ass.

22:30.870 --> 22:34.790
Uh, 9 o'clock at The Shack.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.040
- Alright, later.
- Later.

23:05.700 --> 23:09.200
"He came up to me. Andy Collen
sat with me all lunch.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.950
"And he said
he'd see me tomorrow.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.290
"My man is gonna be strong,
and handsome

23:14.370 --> 23:15.710
"and smart and fierce.

23:15.790 --> 23:16.850
"And he's gonna move to Maine

23:16.880 --> 23:18.960
and live at Lavender House."

23:29.600 --> 23:32.640
"I'm fine with being alone.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.850
"The truth is, how my father
treated me, how he beat me,

23:35.940 --> 23:38.810
"it affected me.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.900
"If I were to have a man,
he would need to be

23:40.980 --> 23:42.980
"very gentle and understanding.

23:43.070 --> 23:47.200
"Patient and kind,
maybe dashing and refined.

23:47.280 --> 23:52.370
Most of all, successful,
because I like being alone."

24:05.340 --> 24:08.840
Give me a holler
when they're done, Tom.

24:08.930 --> 24:11.720
- Good morning.
- Good morning, slick.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.890
Tom doesn't mess around
when it comes to coffee.

24:13.970 --> 24:16.060
So it seems.

24:19.060 --> 24:22.110
- I like your kids.
- Yeah, they liked you too.

24:22.190 --> 24:23.190
Even Amber?

24:23.230 --> 24:25.740
Even Amber, yes.

24:25.820 --> 24:30.120
Let's see, well, Amber likes
boys, make-up, shoes,

24:30.200 --> 24:32.870
clothes,
and boys bears repeating.

24:32.950 --> 24:36.200
Um, she hates schoolwork,

24:36.290 --> 24:38.660
her dad, her mom,

24:38.750 --> 24:41.540
uh, helping me out around the
house and pumping her own gas.

24:41.630 --> 24:43.380
Well, isn't it normal
for a girl her age

24:43.460 --> 24:45.170
not to like those things?

24:45.260 --> 24:47.470
Yeah, I guess so. Uh...

24:47.550 --> 24:51.090
She hates me because, well,
I'm exactly what you said I am.

24:51.180 --> 24:54.060
I'm a protective dad and, yeah,
I'm strict about her getting

24:54.140 --> 24:56.520
good grades
'cause my girl is smart as hell.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.850
Uh, she hates her mom 'cause her
mom is all about getting laid.

24:59.940 --> 25:01.650
Younger the guy, the better.

25:01.730 --> 25:03.560
- Is she Ethan's...
- No.

25:03.650 --> 25:07.070
Okay, uh, Amber and Connor
have the same mom.

25:07.150 --> 25:08.420
I married someone else
in between.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.070
That lasted three months.

25:10.160 --> 25:13.200
Ethan has a different mom.
That lasted three years.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.490
Yo, Jake! Food's up!

25:19.710 --> 25:21.460
There we go. Dig into that.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.210
So, how did you get to know
gran so well?

25:26.300 --> 25:28.630
Oh, well, it's a...

25:28.720 --> 25:30.960
It's a whole story. I...
You know what, I owe you dinner.

25:31.010 --> 25:33.600
I'll take you out.
I'll tell you the whole thing.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.260
Sounds doable.

25:39.230 --> 25:41.140
Henry.

25:41.230 --> 25:43.900
- Henry.
- Josephine.

25:43.980 --> 25:46.570
Hey, you haven't called
in two days.

25:46.650 --> 25:50.320
Sorry, Henry. I-I'm just having
breakfast with Jake.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.280
- Jake?
- Yeah, a friend of gran's.

25:52.360 --> 25:57.490
- Uh, who is Jake?
- He owns a strip club in town.

25:57.580 --> 25:59.080
Your gran was friends
with this guy?

25:59.160 --> 26:02.290
I-it's a long story, Henry.
I'm sorry.

26:02.370 --> 26:04.330
I-I don't have time to tell you
right now.

26:04.420 --> 26:06.140
Okay, well, listen,
I'm meeting you in Paris?

26:06.170 --> 26:08.340
It seems like that's unlikely.

26:11.340 --> 26:12.840
Okay, then I'm cancelling that.

26:12.930 --> 26:15.180
I'm gonna come straight
to Maine.

26:15.260 --> 26:17.720
Can we discuss this later?

26:17.810 --> 26:21.770
Okay, I'll see ya.
Go talk to Jake then.

26:21.850 --> 26:23.270
Alright, buddy, let's roll.

26:30.360 --> 26:31.740
Sound like it went well.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.410
He says he's cancelling work
to come to Magdalene.

26:36.490 --> 26:39.490
Good, 'cause it's good to have
your people around you.

26:39.580 --> 26:41.500
Well, it makes no sense.
There's a video shoot.

26:41.580 --> 26:43.330
There's a lot of money
tied up in it.

26:43.420 --> 26:45.380
You're worth bailing
on all that.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.340
I-it's foolish.

26:47.420 --> 26:49.500
You're worth being that, too.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.550
So, while I'm in Magdalene
I can help out.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.260
If you need someone to take
Ethan after school,

26:59.350 --> 27:00.640
I'd be happy to help.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.390
That's good of you.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.140
The kids really loved Lydie,
you know.

27:05.230 --> 27:06.960
And part of the reason
Amber's such a pain in the butt

27:06.980 --> 27:08.370
these days is that she doesn't
know what to do

27:08.400 --> 27:10.400
with all that hurt
now that Lydie's gone.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.360
- You're done?
- Mm.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.650
Alright.

27:14.740 --> 27:17.360
I'm taking you out to dinner
tomorrow night.

27:17.450 --> 27:19.530
Wear something nice.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.520
Mr. Stone.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.200
I'm not here to talk
about Lavender House.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.770
I'm here to ask you
out to dinner tomorrow night.

27:46.850 --> 27:49.520
I'm sorry.
I have plans this weekend.

27:49.610 --> 27:51.980
Monday night then.

27:52.070 --> 27:56.990
Uh, I-I'm not looking
for romantic attachments.

27:57.070 --> 28:01.830
How about drinks, Monday night
at the club, 7 o'clock?

28:01.910 --> 28:05.500
Fine. Monday night, 7 o'clock.
See you there.

28:05.580 --> 28:07.670
- Great.
- Okay.

28:15.220 --> 28:16.800
Josephine.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.440
So sorry I
couldn't talk before.

28:18.470 --> 28:20.140
I know you're busy.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.300
Don't worry, I got a new guy
filling in for you.

28:22.390 --> 28:24.680
But, uh, he doesn't know me
like you do.

28:24.770 --> 28:28.440
I'm just not sure I'm ready
to go back to work yet, Henry.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.520
Sweetheart, of
course, you're not.

28:30.600 --> 28:35.190
So I was thinkin',
you and I, we need a break.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.990
We're gonna do it
at Lavender House.

28:37.070 --> 28:39.950
Okay, but there's one
little glitch.

28:40.030 --> 28:42.740
Sweetheart,
I can't get out of Paris.

28:44.830 --> 28:46.080
I'll be alright.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.790
Yeah, I know you will,
sweetheart.

28:48.870 --> 28:52.170
But listen, tell me about Jake.
Who's Jake?

28:52.250 --> 28:54.630
Oh, Jake and his kids were
really close to gran

28:54.710 --> 28:56.420
and they're missing her a lot.

28:56.510 --> 29:00.220
It's... It's so sweet.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.890
Well, I'm really glad you have
them there, honey. That's great.

29:02.970 --> 29:04.470
Um, listen,
you'll have me there too.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.810
Just as soon as I can.

29:06.890 --> 29:09.560
Oh, Amond's calling.
He's on tour somewhere.

29:09.640 --> 29:12.810
- I've gotta take it. Okay.
- Call me back when you can.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.860
Amond.

29:16.940 --> 29:19.400
You lost your grandmother,
you didn't even call me?

29:19.490 --> 29:23.030
- Hi!
- Josephine, you're my girl.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.260
And even though you decide
to not officially be my girl,

29:25.280 --> 29:26.660
you still are.

29:26.740 --> 29:30.250
I'm fine.
I-it's lovely that you care.

29:30.330 --> 29:33.380
Josephine, whenever
I'm on that red carpet,

29:33.460 --> 29:37.300
any girl that I have on my arm,
she's not you.

29:37.380 --> 29:41.640
You need me, I'm there.
You hear me?

29:41.720 --> 29:45.470
I hear you.
Thanks for calling, Amond.

29:45.560 --> 29:48.390
It was good talking to you.
I'll talk to you later.

31:08.390 --> 31:10.060
One, two, three. Weave!

31:10.140 --> 31:11.810
One, one, two, three.
Weave! Nice.

31:11.890 --> 31:13.560
One, one, two, three.
Weave. Good.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.310
One, one, two, three.
Weave.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.400
One, one, two, three.
Weave. Get down.

31:17.480 --> 31:19.110
One, one, two, three.
Weave. Nice.

31:19.190 --> 31:20.900
One, one, two, three. Yes!

31:20.980 --> 31:23.240
One, one, two, three. Yeah.

31:24.610 --> 31:26.700
Betty, take over.

31:33.160 --> 31:36.420
- Hey. Is everything alright?
- Hey.

31:36.500 --> 31:40.500
Gran's clothes,
there's no reason to keep them.

31:40.590 --> 31:45.010
Uh, I'm... Maybe s-somebody
could use them.

31:45.090 --> 31:48.720
Uh, I just want it to be
a den again. I just...

31:48.800 --> 31:50.810
- Maybe you...
- Hey, I'll take care of it.

31:50.890 --> 31:52.200
I'll take care of it.
I'll take care of the clothes.

31:52.220 --> 31:54.600
I'll take care of the den.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.770
Thank you.

31:58.440 --> 32:02.360
- I'll let you go.
- No, no. Hey. Well...

32:02.440 --> 32:05.570
Yeah, I gotta work, but you want
me to swing by later tonight?

32:05.650 --> 32:08.160
No, I-I'm okay.
That's-that's very kind of you.

32:08.240 --> 32:11.700
But, uh, really, I'm okay.

32:11.780 --> 32:13.350
Well, listen,
you have any other worries,

32:13.370 --> 32:14.700
I'm just a phone call away.

32:14.790 --> 32:17.460
Yes.

32:17.540 --> 32:19.630
- So, I'll see you tomorrow?
- I'll see you tomorrow.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.060
- Hello.
- Hello.

32:42.150 --> 32:44.230
- I'll just get my coat.
- Alright.

32:50.070 --> 32:52.870
- Hey, uh, let me get that.
- Oh...

32:52.950 --> 32:55.240
- Where are we going?
- To Eve's.

32:55.330 --> 32:58.080
- Ooh, that's expensive.
- Well, you're you.

32:58.160 --> 33:02.040
And you're wearing that dress,
so where else would I take you?

33:02.130 --> 33:04.380
Well, you took me
to The Shack yesterday.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.630
And wasn't it the best seafood
omelet in town?

33:06.720 --> 33:09.680
What are the kids doing tonight?

33:09.760 --> 33:11.470
Uh, well, Amber's grounded.

33:11.550 --> 33:13.800
Uh, Ethan's
probably eating junk food

33:13.890 --> 33:15.530
and Connor's got
one of his girls coming over.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.060
- Oh, one of his girls.
- Oh, yeah. He's got five.

33:18.140 --> 33:20.850
Well, that doesn't bode well
for the future.

33:20.940 --> 33:23.230
Women don't like to share.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.940
Well, if a man's
any kind of a man

33:25.020 --> 33:27.360
the first time he hurts a woman,
he doesn't do that again.

33:27.440 --> 33:31.110
And how did that lead you
to getting married three times?

33:31.200 --> 33:34.120
Look, I got nothing to hide.
I did what I did.

33:34.200 --> 33:37.870
I made some mistakes, but, uh,
you know, I'm still standing.

33:37.950 --> 33:40.120
My kids are happy and healthy.

33:55.810 --> 33:58.930
So, your wives...

33:59.020 --> 34:01.350
Alright, let's do it. Um...

34:03.100 --> 34:05.980
Donna's the first one.
My first love. Loved her.

34:06.070 --> 34:08.570
She wanted divorce.
I gave it to her.

34:08.650 --> 34:11.239
Uh, then it was Mandy,
second one. Loved her.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.239
She couldn't hack the kids.

34:13.320 --> 34:17.120
- And the last one?
- Sloan, Ethan's mom.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.040
Uh, you're down with real?

34:19.120 --> 34:21.460
I'm down with real.

34:21.540 --> 34:25.210
- Uh, she was fantastic in bed.
- That's it?

34:25.290 --> 34:27.250
No. No, no, no.

34:27.340 --> 34:28.760
She was incredibly
fantastic in bed.

34:31.340 --> 34:33.219
It sounds like
you didn't wanna end things

34:33.300 --> 34:35.429
with any of these women.

34:35.510 --> 34:39.520
Well, you open your eyes,
you see the signs.

34:39.600 --> 34:43.440
Well, you followed your heart.
And I think that's very brave.

35:05.750 --> 35:09.460
I've never been here
without gran.

35:09.550 --> 35:12.220
I know she'd be happy
we're doing this together.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.630
And you look great in your suit.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.680
- Thanks for inviting me.
- No. Uh...

35:17.760 --> 35:19.850
The pleasure's all mine.
Believe me.

35:22.770 --> 35:24.850
From the man at the bar.

35:29.610 --> 35:32.070
Does he honestly think
that will impress me?

35:36.660 --> 35:38.740
Excuse me a second, would you?

35:45.040 --> 35:47.120
Outside.

35:54.260 --> 35:56.510
Oh, you have got some stones
on you, huh?

35:56.590 --> 35:59.720
- It's a pun, right?
- No, no, it's a compliment.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.620
You send a drink to a woman
sitting across from me.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.520
I mean, you've got more balls
than brains.

36:03.600 --> 36:06.140
I'm pretty sure the Dom Perignon
would've been wasted on you.

36:06.230 --> 36:07.560
Now, you listen to me.

36:07.650 --> 36:09.730
Josie's got
way too much class for you.

36:09.820 --> 36:11.210
So I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

36:11.230 --> 36:12.940
but it's, it's just
never gonna happen.

36:13.030 --> 36:15.990
We'll see what happens Monday
night between me and Josie.

36:16.070 --> 36:18.200
We both know
that Josie Malone is hot.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.990
My suggestion to you,
get in there and do it

36:21.080 --> 36:23.830
before your little charm
wears off.

36:23.910 --> 36:24.910
- Ooh!
- Josephine.

36:24.960 --> 36:25.960
I guess I won't be having

36:26.040 --> 36:27.420
a drink with you Monday night.

36:27.500 --> 36:28.810
It's really unfortunate
that you had to hear...

36:28.830 --> 36:30.840
No, no.
It's not unfortunate at all.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.480
I thought you were just shallow
and insensitive.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.380
But it turns out,
there's much more to you,

36:34.460 --> 36:36.800
and none of it is good.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.400
This is the first
nice evening I've had

36:38.430 --> 36:39.550
since my grandmother died.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.680
I'm not gonna let you ruin it.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.600
Come on, Jake.
Let's go inside.

36:43.680 --> 36:45.850
I'm desperate for a martini.

36:49.900 --> 36:52.480
- Wow!
- No wonder gran liked you.

36:54.940 --> 36:59.530
Can I ask that we just sally
forth and enjoy the evening?

37:01.240 --> 37:05.120
We can sally forth
anywhere you want, slick.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.200
Just don't hit me.

37:23.350 --> 37:26.600
Oh, gran and I used
to sit up here all the time.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.770
Yeah?

37:30.900 --> 37:32.980
So, tell me how you two met.

37:35.230 --> 37:39.860
Well, there's a local news
reporter who's a friend of mine.

37:39.950 --> 37:44.450
And, uh, when it looked like
the gym was gonna close,

37:44.530 --> 37:45.790
she made a big deal about it.

37:45.870 --> 37:47.660
"Truck! Truck, they're gonna
close the gym.

37:47.750 --> 37:49.390
And the kids are gonna lose
their league."

37:49.460 --> 37:51.120
Lose their league?

37:51.210 --> 37:54.500
Yeah, I have a junior boxing
league I run out of the gym.

37:54.590 --> 37:57.510
What is the Truck?

37:57.590 --> 37:59.800
I'm the Truck. Used to box.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.550
Oh, you're a pugilist.

38:02.640 --> 38:06.100
Used to be, a pretty good one.
Uh...

38:06.180 --> 38:07.850
Had a few pretty decent fights,
you know.

38:07.930 --> 38:10.060
Made some good money.

38:10.140 --> 38:12.350
But, uh, you know,
body can't take that forever,

38:12.440 --> 38:13.860
not to mention the head.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.690
So, I got out.
I came back to Maine.

38:16.780 --> 38:18.610
And I used the winnings
to open the gym.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.950
And why do they call you
the Truck?

38:21.030 --> 38:22.530
Mm...

38:22.610 --> 38:25.160
I was fighting some college kid.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.520
Two minutes into
the first round,

38:26.580 --> 38:28.500
I gave him a left hook,
dropped him.

38:28.580 --> 38:31.210
They asked him what happened
after the fight,

38:31.290 --> 38:33.080
said he thought
he got hit by a Mack Truck.

38:33.170 --> 38:35.040
So, Truck.

38:35.130 --> 38:38.050
I'm guessing
that's complimentary.

38:38.130 --> 38:39.800
I-I took it that way. Yeah.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.590
So, you were
about to lose your gym.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.720
Yeah, and then Lydie

38:47.810 --> 38:49.770
offered to help bail me out.

38:49.850 --> 38:51.810
I was working two jobs
at the time.

38:51.890 --> 38:54.730
I was... I had the gym and I was
a bouncer down at The Circus.

38:54.810 --> 38:57.440
It was a dump back then.

38:57.520 --> 38:59.570
But I knew
that if I could buy it,

38:59.650 --> 39:01.990
I could turn that place around.

39:02.070 --> 39:04.240
So, Lydie suggested
if I put my gym up as collateral

39:04.320 --> 39:07.030
she would loan me
the rest of the money.

39:07.120 --> 39:10.950
- Obviously, I said no.
- You said no?

39:11.040 --> 39:13.100
Yeah, I'm not taking money
from an 86-year-old lady.

39:14.080 --> 39:18.710
- But eventually you did.
- Well, she met the kids.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.970
And she got involved
in our lives.

39:23.050 --> 39:25.340
She kept us and we kept her.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.890
And, uh, yeah, eventually,
she wore me down.

39:27.970 --> 39:30.140
And so, I bought The Circus,
I closed it down.

39:30.220 --> 39:33.480
I fixed it up. I paid her back
within a year.

39:33.560 --> 39:36.190
And, uh, life changed.

39:38.360 --> 39:40.230
I think it's great
that she helped you.

39:40.320 --> 39:44.030
I just don't understand
how she could be so involved

39:44.110 --> 39:47.570
in your lives and yet, she never
introduced any of you to me.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.370
Well, she talked about you
all the time.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.420
My best guess
is that once she has you,

39:57.500 --> 39:58.840
she didn't wanna share you.

39:58.920 --> 40:01.000
In seven years?

40:03.880 --> 40:06.680
Look, I got no answers for you.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.720
I hate that she's gone, but...

40:09.800 --> 40:11.890
we got each other now.

40:15.730 --> 40:17.810
We have each other now.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.070
Another good night.

40:28.070 --> 40:30.160
Yep.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.250
No, no, no. Don't get up.

40:41.630 --> 40:43.130
Alright.

40:43.210 --> 40:45.590
Sleep tight.

40:45.670 --> 40:48.550
- You too.
- Don't forget to lock up.

40:50.140 --> 40:52.220
Goodnight!

41:02.820 --> 41:04.900
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.620
How was dinner?

41:12.700 --> 41:13.990
Um...

41:14.080 --> 41:16.790
Josie is amazing.

41:16.870 --> 41:18.420
You into her?

41:18.500 --> 41:19.750
What are you grillin' me for?

41:19.830 --> 41:21.140
You got a girl in there
watching television.

41:21.170 --> 41:23.840
'Cause Ethan says
she's mega pretty.

41:26.630 --> 41:28.260
Well, she is that.

41:28.340 --> 41:30.640
Just see for yourself.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.800
Hey, Connor.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.020
Pick one.

41:37.100 --> 41:39.940
A woman's heart is fragile
and precious.

41:40.020 --> 41:42.100
Don't be that asshole
kickin' it around.

41:54.030 --> 41:55.990
What's shakin', slick?

41:56.080 --> 41:59.120
I'm not sure how to answer that
since nothing's shaking, Jake.

42:01.170 --> 42:03.500
Okay. I think that's it.

42:03.580 --> 42:05.670
You wanna see?

42:08.960 --> 42:10.630
There you go.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.800
Oh...

42:14.760 --> 42:16.850
Wow.

42:19.890 --> 42:21.600
Thank you.

42:21.690 --> 42:23.600
- I don't know how to...
- No, no, please.

42:23.690 --> 42:25.810
I think we established
you don't have to say anything.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.820
Would you like to stay
for a beer or something?

42:30.900 --> 42:32.780
I'd love to,
but it's Football Sunday.

42:32.860 --> 42:35.950
I got rotel dip to make,
family favorite.

42:36.030 --> 42:37.410
Rotel dip?

42:37.490 --> 42:40.040
You don't know
what rotel dip is?

42:40.120 --> 42:41.390
Come on, you take a can
of rotel, you dump it

42:41.410 --> 42:42.920
on a block of cheese,
you nuke it,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.540
you serve it with corn chips.
It's my specialty.

42:45.630 --> 42:47.920
You should come over
next Sunday. Try it.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.090
I'd like that.

42:53.380 --> 42:55.470
Alright, well...

43:02.560 --> 43:06.310
Hi, would you guys
like to come over for dinner?

43:06.400 --> 43:08.360
Sure. Yeah, we'd love to.

43:13.110 --> 43:16.910
- Hi!
- Hello.

43:16.990 --> 43:18.870
- And son number one, Connor.
- Hi.

43:18.950 --> 43:20.910
Hi. Connor, I've heard
so much about you.

43:20.990 --> 43:22.290
It's a pleasure to meet you.

43:22.370 --> 43:23.750
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

43:23.830 --> 43:26.710
And I've heard a lot about you
from Lydie.

43:26.790 --> 43:28.130
- Hi, Amber.
- Hello.

43:28.210 --> 43:29.920
Hey, if you promise
not to mumble tonight,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.630
I'll show you
what Jean-Michel sent me.

43:32.720 --> 43:34.550
He was very inspired
by your face.

43:34.630 --> 43:36.050
He was inspired by my face?

43:36.140 --> 43:38.350
Yeah, don't act so surprised.
You're really pretty.

43:40.810 --> 43:42.200
- That's very good of you.
- Beer, dad?

43:42.220 --> 43:44.310
Yeah. Yeah, thanks, bud.

43:47.610 --> 43:49.940
- Oh, great!
- Oh, my God!

43:50.020 --> 43:52.360
Amber Spear.

43:52.440 --> 43:54.990
Once your grounding is over,
if your dad says it's okay,

43:55.070 --> 43:56.470
I would like to take you
to the mall

43:56.490 --> 43:58.370
and get you some
of these products.

43:58.450 --> 44:00.280
I would so love that.

44:00.370 --> 44:02.100
But just one condition, you
gotta keep speaking properly.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.870
No more mumbling.

44:04.960 --> 44:06.830
Are you bribing me with makeup?

44:06.920 --> 44:08.460
Absolutely.

44:11.550 --> 44:13.130
Why not?

44:13.220 --> 44:16.930
I love this so much.
I really do.

44:17.010 --> 44:20.220
- That was so good.
- Josie, thank you.

44:20.300 --> 44:21.870
It was the classiest
roast chicken I ever had.

44:21.890 --> 44:25.060
Oh, wow.

44:25.140 --> 44:27.190
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

44:27.270 --> 44:29.360
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

44:31.650 --> 44:33.420
Oh, since I'm gonna be staying
in Magdalene a while,

44:33.440 --> 44:36.490
I'm gonna need a car, I thought
you might know someone.

44:36.570 --> 44:38.860
Yeah, of course. You just
let me know when you're ready.

44:38.950 --> 44:41.030
I'll be there.

45:02.180 --> 45:04.270
Josephine!

45:04.720 --> 45:08.350
Josie.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.770
Hey.

45:09.860 --> 45:10.940
Josie, awake.

45:11.020 --> 45:13.110
- Oh!
- Oh!

45:13.190 --> 45:15.610
It's my fault.

45:15.690 --> 45:17.700
- What are you doin' here?
- I'm sorry.

45:17.780 --> 45:19.380
I came to bring you
to the gym for a workout.

45:19.410 --> 45:22.620
Oh, I-I don't have any
workout clothes.

45:22.700 --> 45:25.040
Well, Amber went
on a fitness kick last year

45:25.120 --> 45:27.960
and, uh, there's the results.

45:28.040 --> 45:30.120
They're yours now.
Have at it.

45:41.090 --> 45:43.180
You're up, slick.

45:44.390 --> 45:48.350
Uh, I-I'm not the most graceful
of women.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.770
- Not in heels.
- Also, not in heels.

45:50.850 --> 45:51.870
When are you not in heels?

45:51.900 --> 45:53.150
Well, this morning when I

45:53.230 --> 45:55.480
banged my head into your jaw.

45:55.570 --> 45:57.650
Come on, let's see it.

46:00.070 --> 46:02.280
Back at it.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.620
- Oh, I feel silly!
- Stop it.

46:04.700 --> 46:07.120
You are nothing but class,
head to toe.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.080
You're just little bit
of a klutz.

46:09.160 --> 46:11.120
But you own it, baby,
'cause it's cute.

46:11.210 --> 46:12.890
- And because it's you.
- You're very sweet.

46:12.920 --> 46:14.710
And you're very cute.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.760
We're going to a football game
tomorrow night.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.630
Oh, that sounds fun.
Does Connor play?

46:19.720 --> 46:21.930
Nah. Nah, he's a boxer
like his old man.

46:22.010 --> 46:24.220
This place is gonna be his
someday if he wants it.

46:24.300 --> 46:26.390
Excuse me.

46:34.940 --> 46:36.570
Are you new to women's league?

46:36.650 --> 46:39.940
Uh, I don't know what that is,
so I guess that's a no.

46:40.030 --> 46:43.740
Good to know, seems like no one
should put a glove to that face.

46:43.820 --> 46:47.200
- Name's Micky.
- Josephine.

46:47.280 --> 46:50.870
Please tell me Jake is opening
the gym to aerobics classes

46:50.960 --> 46:52.330
and you're the instructor.

46:52.420 --> 46:57.040
Oh, alas! I have to dash
your dream!

46:57.130 --> 46:59.960
Did you lose something, Mick?

47:00.050 --> 47:02.430
She's with me.

47:02.510 --> 47:03.870
Comin' to the match
Saturday night?

47:03.930 --> 47:05.260
What's up?

47:05.340 --> 47:07.390
Mick and I are in the league
together.

47:07.470 --> 47:09.640
I'll drop off tickets
at the box office for ya.

47:09.720 --> 47:11.040
Oh, you know what,
if she wants to come,

47:11.060 --> 47:12.520
I think I can handle it.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.560
You got three kids and DeeDee
to handle.

47:14.650 --> 47:16.560
I'll take her, okay?

47:16.650 --> 47:18.210
DeeDee's been gone
for five months, Mick,

47:18.230 --> 47:20.900
but I kinda feel like
you knew that.

47:20.990 --> 47:23.070
Right.

47:25.490 --> 47:28.990
We are gonna make cream puffs
from scratch.

47:29.080 --> 47:31.410
- Awesome!
- Hey, wait up.

47:31.500 --> 47:34.620
- Cream puffs, dude!
- Awesome, little dude.

47:34.710 --> 47:36.630
- Hi, Connor.
- Yo, Josie. You doing good?

47:36.710 --> 47:39.670
- I'm great. How are you?
- Nothing gets me down.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.800
I-I love the rap,
but I gotta clock in.

47:41.880 --> 47:43.840
Later, bro!

47:43.920 --> 47:46.550
You know they got cream puffs
at the bakery.

47:46.640 --> 47:48.220
But I bet yours will be better.

47:48.300 --> 47:50.220
Well, people sometimes
put sweet, whipped cream

47:50.310 --> 47:52.350
or vanilla pudding
between the choux pastry

47:52.430 --> 47:55.020
which can be exasperating.

47:55.100 --> 47:57.360
We are gonna make
creme patissiere.

47:57.440 --> 47:59.780
What's creme patissiere?

47:59.860 --> 48:01.940
Proof there is a God.

48:07.780 --> 48:09.870
Yo!

48:11.450 --> 48:13.410
Hey, Micky.

48:13.500 --> 48:16.290
Wanna check out the firehouse,
little man?

48:16.370 --> 48:18.460
I'll look after your bags,
you go in.

48:21.300 --> 48:23.840
Um, I'm supposed to be in charge
of Ethan, I kinda need to

48:23.920 --> 48:25.130
keep an eye on him.

48:25.220 --> 48:27.590
Yo, Jimbo!
My boy, Eth's in there!

48:27.680 --> 48:31.060
- Keep an eye on him, will you?
- Alright, I got him.

48:31.140 --> 48:32.810
You have plans tomorrow night?

48:32.890 --> 48:35.680
Uh, Jake and I have plans
tomorrow night.

48:35.770 --> 48:38.190
Are you and Jake an item?

48:38.270 --> 48:40.270
We're just friends.

48:40.360 --> 48:43.530
How about we do dinner,
Sunday night?

48:43.610 --> 48:46.660
I'd like that, Micky.

48:46.740 --> 48:49.570
But I should go. Ethan and I
are making cream puffs.

48:49.660 --> 48:51.740
Eth, you got cream puffs
to make.

48:56.920 --> 49:00.500
- See you Sunday.
- Bye.

49:00.580 --> 49:03.550
Hey, Josie, you going to dad
and Micky's fight Saturday?

49:03.630 --> 49:06.050
- Yeah.
- Awesome!

49:06.130 --> 49:09.220
I usually go, but Combat Raptor
comes out tomorrow

49:09.300 --> 49:11.640
and I'm going to Josh's, and
we're all going to the movies,

49:11.720 --> 49:14.640
and then I'm sleepin' over,
I can't freaking wait!

49:14.720 --> 49:16.640
How do you know
if you're gonna like it?

49:16.730 --> 49:18.230
Uh, Josie,

49:18.310 --> 49:21.770
it's Combat Raptor!

49:21.860 --> 49:24.320
Are Connor and Amber
going to your dad's fight?

49:24.400 --> 49:25.650
Amber? No way.

49:25.740 --> 49:27.900
She'll be on a date with Noah.

49:27.990 --> 49:29.610
Connor normally always goes,

49:29.700 --> 49:32.080
but he's scrapin' off
all his girlfriends.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.970
So, he'll probably be breaking
some chick's heart

49:33.990 --> 49:35.660
Saturday night.

49:35.740 --> 49:38.100
Connor is breaking up
with his girlfriends?

49:39.080 --> 49:42.000
- Dad laid down the law.
- Uh-huh.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.210
- You wanna drive?
- Sure.

49:43.300 --> 49:45.380
What? Get in the car!

50:04.480 --> 50:06.820
Here.

50:06.900 --> 50:09.180
You know, Lydie knitted this
for me three Christmases ago.

50:09.240 --> 50:12.870
Aw! Thanks.

50:12.950 --> 50:14.950
I'm gonna get some cocoa,
do you want some?

50:15.040 --> 50:17.120
Yeah. It's right over there.

50:28.380 --> 50:30.010
- Hi, you're Josie.
- I am and you are?

50:30.090 --> 50:32.470
I'm Taylor,
I'm Amber's bestest bestie.

50:32.550 --> 50:35.180
Well, one of them.
She's spoken of you, like, lots.

50:35.260 --> 50:36.850
Your outfit is very chic.

50:36.930 --> 50:39.230
And you wear it well,
it just needs a fedora.

50:39.310 --> 50:40.850
I know, right?
But I'll be lucky

50:40.940 --> 50:42.460
if I don't get tripped,
pushed, or run down

50:42.480 --> 50:44.500
before the night is through,
destroying these trousers.

50:44.520 --> 50:46.110
Well, small-minded fools
are everywhere,

50:46.190 --> 50:48.190
and those who have the courage
to be who they are

50:48.280 --> 50:50.110
often have to suffer them.

50:50.200 --> 50:53.530
You totally looked through Amber
like she wasn't even there.

50:53.620 --> 50:56.950
- You done with her yet?
- Amber Spear is a total tease.

50:57.040 --> 50:58.370
And her dad's a pain in my ass.

50:58.450 --> 51:00.410
Won't let her go
to the Bounce concert.

51:00.500 --> 51:03.420
She's hot, but if Amber likes
her cherry that much,

51:03.500 --> 51:05.880
she can keep it.

51:05.960 --> 51:08.880
- Are you Noah?
- Yeah, I'm Noah.

51:08.960 --> 51:10.510
Well, Noah, you should know

51:10.590 --> 51:12.720
that Amber won't be going
to the concert with you

51:12.800 --> 51:15.470
because she and the Taylors
are going with me.

51:15.550 --> 51:17.510
I'm a friend of Lavon's
and he doesn't like

51:17.600 --> 51:19.270
a lot of people backstage.

51:19.350 --> 51:21.180
And Amber wanted to give her
backstage passes

51:21.270 --> 51:22.980
to her best besties.

51:23.060 --> 51:25.690
Oh, and as for your idea
that Amber's a tease,

51:25.770 --> 51:28.190
she isn't,
she's just not that into you.

51:28.280 --> 51:29.960
So, please, you totally look
through Amber.

51:29.980 --> 51:32.530
It'll save you some frustration
and maybe heartbreak

51:32.610 --> 51:34.280
when she finds out
how shallow you are

51:34.360 --> 51:35.360
and cuts you loose.

51:35.450 --> 51:37.200
Holy shit.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.660
Oh, and one final thing,

51:38.740 --> 51:40.140
badmouthing a woman
when everyone can hear

51:40.160 --> 51:41.410
is just bad manners.

51:41.500 --> 51:43.750
Says nothing about the woman
and everything

51:43.830 --> 51:46.840
about your own character.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.420
You may wanna move forward,
Taylor.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.500
- We're losing the line.
- That was epic.

51:50.590 --> 51:54.050
Well, we gotta hurry up
and text Amber.

51:54.130 --> 51:56.680
I so totally told you, Amber.
He's completely up his own ass.

51:56.760 --> 51:58.410
He is, girlfriend,
he is so not worth

51:58.430 --> 51:59.490
putting up with all of this.

51:59.510 --> 52:00.810
I think that's true, I think

52:00.890 --> 52:02.220
I maybe even said that to him

52:02.310 --> 52:04.390
and probably fibbed a bit.

52:06.350 --> 52:07.940
You fibbed?

52:08.020 --> 52:11.570
I told him I was taking you
and the Taylors to Bounce.

52:11.650 --> 52:13.960
But first, you guys need to get
permission from your parents

52:13.990 --> 52:15.700
and I need to discuss it
with your father.

52:15.780 --> 52:17.910
And second, you need to tread
very carefully tonight.

52:17.990 --> 52:20.990
I have no idea how he's gonna
react to my little talk.

52:21.080 --> 52:23.080
He called me a tease?

52:23.160 --> 52:25.750
- He acted like he liked me.
- I mean, he probably does.

52:25.830 --> 52:28.670
He just has to show
a certain face to his friends.

52:28.750 --> 52:32.590
But, Josie, I've liked him
since, like, forever.

52:32.670 --> 52:35.300
I know, i-it's just...

52:35.380 --> 52:37.550
He may not live up to what you
thought he would be.

52:37.640 --> 52:40.100
- He was totally a douche.
- He's always been a douche.

52:40.180 --> 52:42.020
It's completely inappropriate
for me to call

52:42.100 --> 52:43.580
a teenage boy a douche,
but you're right,

52:43.600 --> 52:47.350
he was a total douche.

52:47.440 --> 52:49.400
Ugh! I hate you!

52:49.480 --> 52:53.360
- No, no. Mia!
- Go away.

52:53.440 --> 52:55.320
Uh-oh! He's cutting Mia off,

52:55.400 --> 52:57.490
and she's not takin' it well.

53:03.580 --> 53:05.660
- Whoo!
- Nice.

53:09.460 --> 53:11.750
Oh, I have a few things
to tell you.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.460
Uh, with your permission
I'd like to take

53:13.550 --> 53:16.130
Amber and the Taylors
to see Bounce in Boston.

53:16.220 --> 53:17.940
Oh, and Amber and Noah,
if they were ever together,

53:17.970 --> 53:20.970
they're broken up, I maybe
partially responsible for that.

53:21.050 --> 53:22.780
It's likely there'll be some
teenager-girl moods

53:22.810 --> 53:24.430
in your house
for the foreseeable future

53:24.520 --> 53:27.560
and I'd like to apologize
for that in advance.

53:27.640 --> 53:31.310
Jesus, slick,
how long were you gone?

53:31.400 --> 53:33.480
Hey. Ellie.

53:35.070 --> 53:37.150
We need to talk.

53:40.070 --> 53:42.160
Amber.

53:46.330 --> 53:48.330
That's my girl.

53:48.420 --> 53:49.830
You take good care of her.

53:49.920 --> 53:53.170
I think I get more out of it
than she does.

53:53.250 --> 53:56.130
Oh, then you think wrong, slick.

53:56.210 --> 53:58.300
Come on.

54:05.520 --> 54:06.770
Thanks.

54:06.850 --> 54:08.810
- This is Jake.
- Hey.

54:08.890 --> 54:10.900
How are Connor and Amber?

54:10.980 --> 54:13.320
Hey! Uh, well...

54:13.400 --> 54:14.900
Amber's doing little better
than Con,

54:14.980 --> 54:16.000
Connor had
kind of a rough night.

54:16.030 --> 54:18.240
He, uh, broke up with Mia.

54:18.320 --> 54:21.950
But then, uh, his final choice,
Ellie, dumped him

54:22.030 --> 54:24.240
when, uh, he told her
that she had made the cut.

54:24.330 --> 54:28.120
Oh. I'm not sure "made the cut"
was the right choice of words.

54:28.200 --> 54:30.330
Yeah, you think?

54:30.420 --> 54:32.170
Are you working out?

54:32.250 --> 54:34.290
Yeah, somethin' like that.

54:34.380 --> 54:35.710
I'll call you later.

54:35.800 --> 54:37.880
Alright, slick.

54:53.520 --> 54:55.770
- Josephine.
- Hi!

54:55.860 --> 54:57.070
How are you doing?

54:57.150 --> 55:00.320
Jet-lagged.
Just got to Paris.

55:00.400 --> 55:02.570
I-I need some help,
I need some advice.

55:02.660 --> 55:04.200
I'm going
to a boxing match tonight

55:04.280 --> 55:06.870
and I don't know what to wear.

55:06.950 --> 55:08.740
Why are you going to a fight,
Josephine?

55:08.830 --> 55:11.790
I've been asked by the fighters.

55:11.870 --> 55:14.330
Plural?

55:14.420 --> 55:16.710
That's my Josephine girl there.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.480
Been there a couple weeks
and she's setting

55:18.500 --> 55:21.260
Maine on fire with her ice.

55:21.340 --> 55:23.430
You smoke everything you put on,

55:23.510 --> 55:25.260
but you gonna have to
trick yourself out.

55:25.340 --> 55:28.310
Man see a girl sittin' ringside
and shit's hot,

55:28.390 --> 55:30.390
and she's lookin' all ice cold,

55:30.480 --> 55:31.810
that might be some ammunition

55:31.890 --> 55:34.020
for him to kick
some serious ass.

55:34.100 --> 55:35.650
Tricked out it is.

55:35.730 --> 55:37.150
How you doin' otherwise?

55:37.230 --> 55:40.650
I have my moments,
but gran had good friends

55:40.740 --> 55:42.650
and they're taking care of me.

55:42.740 --> 55:44.360
Good!

55:44.450 --> 55:46.010
I'mma check my schedule
in the next couple of weeks

55:46.030 --> 55:47.780
and see if I can come
check you out.

55:47.870 --> 55:49.870
- I hope so, I'd love that.
- Alright.

55:49.950 --> 55:51.830
- I'mma talk to you later.
- Bye.

55:51.910 --> 55:53.100
Alright.

56:15.770 --> 56:16.770
Hi.

56:16.810 --> 56:18.900
Josephine Malone.

56:20.900 --> 56:23.900
Here you are.

56:26.410 --> 56:28.490
Thank you.

56:32.830 --> 56:34.920
Right.

56:43.840 --> 56:46.050
- Hey. Oh.
- I'm Alyssa. Junior's woman.

56:46.130 --> 56:47.430
Hi. Josephine.

56:47.510 --> 56:49.760
I know. Jake's woman.

56:49.850 --> 56:52.140
Word gets around.

56:52.220 --> 56:54.180
So, Junior's up next,
he's fighting Micky.

56:54.270 --> 56:56.020
But don't worry
when Micky messes him up.

56:56.100 --> 56:57.480
Nobody beats Mick but Jake.

56:57.560 --> 57:00.020
Then again,
Jake messes everyone up.

57:00.110 --> 57:01.820
I'm sorry?

57:01.900 --> 57:03.150
Junior doesn't care.

57:03.240 --> 57:05.110
He gets to celebrate
after anyway,

57:05.200 --> 57:06.780
win or lose.

57:06.860 --> 57:08.070
You get me?

57:09.990 --> 57:12.740
Nothing better than a fighter
after a fight,

57:12.830 --> 57:17.790
all that aggression, all that
adrenaline still flowing. Mm...

57:17.870 --> 57:19.210
I love fight night.

57:24.590 --> 57:25.900
Let's go. Fight's on. Let's go!

57:29.510 --> 57:31.720
Mess him up, baby!

57:31.800 --> 57:34.850
Go, tiger.

57:34.930 --> 57:38.020
Is this your first fight?
You'll get me, honey.

57:38.100 --> 57:41.060
Get ready for the ride
of your life, girlfriend.

57:42.190 --> 57:43.820
Oh, come on.

57:43.900 --> 57:45.860
Come on, baby. Go, baby!

57:45.940 --> 57:47.150
I love you, Tiger!

57:47.240 --> 57:49.320
I love you, Tiger!

57:53.120 --> 57:55.120
Come on, baby!

57:55.200 --> 57:57.250
I love you, Tiger!

57:57.330 --> 57:59.420
Whoo!

58:06.670 --> 58:07.780
Break it up, break it up,
break it up.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.880
Break it. Come on, come on.

58:10.550 --> 58:12.640
Go.

58:16.640 --> 58:19.310
- One, two, three.
- Come on, baby. Get up. Get up!

58:19.390 --> 58:21.730
- Get up, baby. Get up!
- Four, five.

58:21.810 --> 58:26.360
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

58:26.440 --> 58:27.530
You're out.

58:29.650 --> 58:32.620
Come on, come on. Let me see
the eyes, let me see the eyes.

58:44.290 --> 58:46.380
Winner!

58:49.800 --> 58:51.880
Good job.

59:03.480 --> 59:05.560
I gotta go. Get my post-fight
drilling from my man.

59:05.650 --> 59:07.480
So quick, give me your number.

59:07.570 --> 59:09.190
We'll do drinks
or lunch or something.

59:09.280 --> 59:10.900
- Come on, hurry. I gotta go.
- Okay.

59:10.990 --> 59:12.660
Come on, I gotta go.

59:12.750 --> 59:14.670
Truck, Truck, Truck,

59:14.740 --> 59:17.830
Truck, Truck, Truck,
Truck, Truck,

59:17.910 --> 59:21.160
Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck,
Truck...

59:42.940 --> 59:46.520
Truck, Truck, Truck, Truck...

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:10.840
Commence boxing.

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:30.320
- Come on.
- Box him. Box him.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400
- That's it.
- One more. You got him down.

01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:35.320
- One more.
- Get him. Get him. Get him!

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.280
- Yes!
- Come on, Truck!

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:41.240
He's out of gas, Truck!
You got this!

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:44.410
Give him the left, baby!
Give him the left!

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.800
Nine, ten.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.300
That's it. That's it. He's out.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.570
Winner, Truck!

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.300
Who do you belong to, gorgeous?

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.380
Jake.

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:38.840
End of the hall,
last door on the left.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:58.030
You going out with Micky
tomorrow night?

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.320
Not anymore.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:09.080
Good answer, slick.

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:20.550
Panties off.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.320
Jake.

01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:46.010
Stay close to me.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:58.320
Hey. Class!
Plough by the Truck.

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:01.740
You shut your fucking mouth.

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:10.870
Okay.

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:13.040
Now, you're somewhere safe.

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:17.040
We had sex in a locker room.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.960
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.640
Were you upset before the fight?

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:31.520
No.

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:34.390
Look, you made a date
with another guy.

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:39.480
You said I wasn't your type.

01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.610
Yeah, I know what I said.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:44.700
But I didn't like it
when I said it.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.990
And then, you came to the gym
to ask me for my help...

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:49.160
And I, I thought...

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.580
I think I might've missed
something.

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.920
Look, I was playing it cool,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.090
but I thought I was being
kinda obvious.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.380
I'm scared.

01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:08.680
Hey.
You don't have to be scared.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.850
Not with me.

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.520
There are things
you don't know about me.

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:20.360
You get that Lydie told me
about you, right?

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.990
Yeah, but something happened
to me tonight.

01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:29.910
When you were boxing, it's like,
I was coming out of my skin.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.120
You think maybe, instead of
coming out of your skin

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:41.710
what you were feeling, was that
disguise starting to drop?

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.880
What disguise?

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.090
That one you've been wearing
for a long time, babe.

01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:58.080
I saw you met Alyssa. You guys
get along? How do you like her?

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.210
Oh, she's lovely.

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:03.210
Little loud.
I really like her.

01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:05.380
Yeah, she's a good woman.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.840
She asked for my number.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.510
Good.

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:12.110
I mean, you know,
you got me and the kids,

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:15.850
but women need other women
to have their backs.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.100
Jake.

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:23.270
What happens now?

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.980
I don't know, Josie.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.000
Morning, slick.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.710
Mm. Fancy.

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:31.170
Hey, don't you,
uh, owe Mick a call?

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.060
Hello?

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.770
Hi. Uh, Micky?

01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:48.479
Let me guess, Jake's standing
right next to you.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.979
Yeah.

01:08:51.069 --> 01:08:52.779
That's where I'd be.

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:55.740
I-I assume you know
why I'm calling.

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:59.200
The way Jake looked at you
and the way you looked at him,

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:01.620
I knew I had a sliver
of a chance at best.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.290
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:04.580
Jake's a good guy.

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:08.000
He just had shit taste in women,
until now.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.590
Thanks, Micky.

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:11.760
You're welcome.
Good luck, okay?

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.380
Josie, I'm so glad you're here.

01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:18.550
I so have to talk to you.
Come on.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.520
You'll never guess
what happened.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.399
- Alexi Prokorov said hey to me.
- Who?

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.080
Only the coolest guy
in the entire school.

01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:31.479
So, we were at the diner
last night

01:09:31.569 --> 01:09:33.939
and he walks right up to me
and he says, "Hey," right to me.

01:09:34.029 --> 01:09:35.899
Alexi doesn't date girls
from Magdalene High.

01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:39.620
He has a motorcycle,
and he plays guitar,

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.330
and he's in a band.
He's dreamy.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.140
This is huge. The one guy
who beats out Noah is Alexi.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.540
He writes his own songs.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:46.220
I heard his band play
at the underage club

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.830
that used to be an old garage
down by the cove.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.210
It was amazing.

01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:52.210
And Noah's called me twice.

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.620
She's gonna break it off
with him.

01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:55.090
I think that's really smart,
Amber.

01:09:55.170 --> 01:09:57.050
Josie, he came right up
to our table

01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:59.010
and said, "Hey," right to me.

01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:01.350
It was the best moment
of my life.

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.520
Hey, where did everybody go?
Dip's up.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.940
Rotel dip?
I'm starved.

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.900
Taylor.

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:12.110
Is this, uh, Alexi a decent guy?

01:10:12.190 --> 01:10:14.480
He gets straight-A's,
his music really is super cool,

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:17.400
and I hear he's a one-woman man.

01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:19.860
But Mr. Spear
is gonna freak way out.

01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:25.580
Get 'em while it's hot.

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:26.830
Everything good?

01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:28.420
For Amber, yes.

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.170
For you, uh, not so much.

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:33.170
Uh, new guy said, "Hey,"
to her at the diner last night.

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:35.340
And he has a motorcycle.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.300
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.610
Is it time to workout?

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:54.980
I have new workout clothes.

01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:57.110
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it is.

01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:59.700
But the workout I had in mind,

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.860
it actually doesn't require
clothes.

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.390
You better tell me
who you are quick.

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.940
Jake, I presume?

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.640
Oh, my God!

01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:34.270
Henry.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.480
Is this a joke?

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.820
The way you talk about Jake

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.130
you failed to mention
just how close

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:40.440
you two were getting.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:41.660
Okay, Henry.

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.660
I-I know it's awkward,

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.870
but I didn't expect you
to be here.

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:49.580
Just think about this
for a second.

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:53.580
It's not surprising to me.
Hey, little thing.

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.340
I know she's good,
but she goes back for seconds.

01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.210
Henry!

01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.860
What'd you think,
after 23 years, the men

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.380
you've been through
don't talk to each other?

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:04.200
I mean, hell, half of them
have already had you.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.300
Why are you talking to me
like this?

01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:09.390
Because I'm sick and tired of
waiting for you to be done

01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:11.310
so I can have my turn.

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:13.480
Your turn?

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.690
I have...

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.570
I have loved you

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:23.360
since you first walked into
the interview two decades ago.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.330
- What?
- Since the beginning...

01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:31.560
You have been
everywhere with me.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.210
I have taken
more photographs of you

01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:35.420
than anybody else.

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.710
But you've always been
with other women.

01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:39.880
And you didn't give a fuck!

01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:44.470
You don't care.

01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:46.640
And you're never gonna care.

01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:53.730
So now I don't care.

01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:55.980
Hey, listen be careful
because what she does

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.360
is she gives you just enough

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.070
to get you wanting

01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:03.530
and then she just leaves you.

01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:05.660
I'm pretty sure
she knows she does that.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.840
You listen to me.

01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:26.990
Anyone who talks to you
like that

01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:28.340
doesn't deserve you.

01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:30.470
He was my friend.

01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:36.480
No. He's an idiot.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.600
He didn't have the guts
to work for what he wanted.

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:43.320
It's just ridiculous
for him to say he loved me.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.440
Hey, Lydie knew.

01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:47.700
She doesn't want him for you.

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.570
She knew that the man for you

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.740
was gonna have to care enough
to do the work.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.750
You're worth it.

01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:21.270
Josephine.

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:25.030
I'm not sure
I'm ready to talk to you.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.830
Well, I'm here to sever
our professional relationship.

01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:35.100
'Cause it's no longer
constructive.

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.620
So, this is it.

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.500
Yeah, this is it.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.930
Except for gran, for 23 years,

01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:52.100
you were the only real thing
I had.

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:55.740
Look, I'm not sure
what kind of happiness

01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:57.980
you think you're gonna
find with a,

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.730
a small-town strip club owner,

01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:02.100
but, hey, Josephine,
if that's what you want,

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:04.270
you know, you got a clear shot.

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.600
You know, my first living memory

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.620
is my father slamming
my mother's head

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.780
against the kitchen floor.

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:20.870
She left us...

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.580
and never came back.

01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:25.630
Sometime after that

01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:28.720
when dad found out I was dating
a boy without his permission,

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.720
he beat me so badly, I was
in the hospital for a week.

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:38.350
Gran saved me from all that.

01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:41.060
She sent me to college.

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:45.060
I fell in love, or so I thought

01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:47.230
until the first time he hit me.

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.780
I came back to gran
after that, too.

01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:59.870
Did you ever wonder
why I was so remote, Henry?

01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:02.790
Honey, I-I never...

01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:04.140
You never told me
about any of this.

01:16:04.170 --> 01:16:05.960
I was so in love with you,

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.400
when we first started
working together

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.050
every day was painful.

01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:12.050
It was either put up
with the pain

01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:14.090
or risk losing
one of the only two people

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:17.140
in my life that I cared about.

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:19.310
You were in love with me?

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:21.940
Head over heels.

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:23.980
You felt the same way as I did?

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:26.150
And neither of us
did anything about it.

01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:33.780
- It wasn't meant to be.
- How do we know that?

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:35.410
We never even gave this a shot.

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:37.240
Because I am falling in love
with someone

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.410
I've only known two weeks.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.460
I should've been
at gran's funeral, okay?

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.290
I've...

01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:49.460
I've messed this up.

01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:53.720
- We both did.
- Yeah.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.890
I'm sorry.

01:16:56.890 --> 01:16:58.970
I'm really sorry.

01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:34.130
I do want you to be happy.

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:49.060
Goodbye, Josephine.

01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:58.910
Sister, you can't sell Jake
any of that.

01:17:58.990 --> 01:18:00.370
When you got a guy
like Jake Spear,

01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:02.410
you do not inform him
that the hot guy

01:18:02.490 --> 01:18:04.160
who's been in love
with you for decades

01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:07.500
came to you and lowered the boom
when he wasn't around.

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:10.630
Uh-huh. Come on.

01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:28.020
Can I ask you
a hypothetical question?

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.190
Shoot.

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:35.610
Hey, uh, you wanna
talk in the office?

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.280
What's up?

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.610
Well, first, can I just say

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:42.370
Alyssa told me that I shouldn't?

01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:44.700
Okay.

01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:46.220
Well, what works
for Alyssa and Junior

01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.500
has nothing to do with us.

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:51.040
So, why don't you just tell me
what happened?

01:18:51.130 --> 01:18:53.540
Henry came to Lavender House
yesterday

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:56.960
and he-he cares for me a lot.

01:18:57.050 --> 01:19:00.050
And now that I'm moving on,
it's difficult for him to take.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.260
Is there more?

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:06.810
Uh, he kissed me.

01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:09.480
I-it was a goodbye.

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.730
Listen to me.

01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:14.690
Never keep anything from me.
Okay?

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:16.840
I know plenty about what doesn't
work between men and women.

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:18.170
And I know for a fact that
keeping things

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.110
from each other
just doesn't work.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.620
Now I'm gonna react how I react,

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:24.240
but you never have
anything to be afraid of.

01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:26.330
I know Alyssa's a good woman.
She meant well.

01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:29.250
But you and I
gotta find our own way.

01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:33.460
You with me, Josie?

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:35.630
I'm with you, Jake.

01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:39.720
Are you upset?

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.760
No.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:45.680
But you're gonna have to
make it up to me.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.060
So what do you think?

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:49.480
You wanna make it up to me
by giving me a kiss

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.600
or you wanna make it up to me
by letting me

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:52.980
fuck you on this desk?

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:56.730
The second one.

01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:58.900
Good answer, slick.

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:11.710
Amond, who is an amazing
hip-hop artist

01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:13.790
and friend of mine.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.460
Found out that Henry fired me.

01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:20.010
And I told him I'm staying
in Maine and I met someone.

01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:22.380
He wants to come check you out.

01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:24.840
Oh, really? Check me out, huh?

01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:28.180
Alright. Bring it on.
I'll tell you what.

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:31.520
You can send every singer,
dancer,

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.020
musician, sculptor,
whatever you got

01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:36.560
to come check me out.
I don't mind.

01:20:36.650 --> 01:20:38.820
I mean, they're the only family
you have, right?

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:41.530
I wanna know that part
of your life, too.

01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:43.700
I want it all.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.280
You just keep getting
more wonderful.

01:21:58.770 --> 01:22:01.360
Jake.
Boston, Terry and my uncle

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.740
are all here at Lavender House.

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:06.740
Okay. I'm not far.
I'll be right there.

01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:08.910
Damn it.

01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:38.400
Hello, Josephine.

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.860
We need to discuss matters.

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.400
No. Not until Jake gets here.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.610
- Why don't we wait inside?
- We're not going inside.

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:48.360
You're not welcome here.

01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:50.120
If you wanna discuss
business matters,

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:53.200
we need to do that in town.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.240
Hey. If you wanna
talk to someone,

01:22:55.330 --> 01:22:58.330
you can talk to me.
What's going on?

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:01.210
Lydia Malone made a highly
unusual bequest in her will

01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:04.340
which indicated she was not
of right mind when she wrote it.

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.300
She also forgot her son.

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:08.400
Did you discuss the terms
of the will with this man?

01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:11.970
Well, Davis Malone, as the only
direct living descendent

01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:14.560
of Lydia Malone is entitled
to know the particulars

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.020
of his mother's last requests.

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:17.640
That's not what I asked you.

01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:19.570
What I asked you was,
did you discuss the terms

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.190
of Lydia's will
with Boston Stone?

01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:22.710
You mentioned Stone
at the will reading

01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:24.080
and now seem to be
colluding with him.

01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:25.940
I'm hardly colluding with him.

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:28.490
I see. So this isn't a play
to sell Lavender House,

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.200
let Malone pocket the profits

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.570
and then let Boston Stone
bulldoze the building

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:34.050
or whatever the hell else he
wants to do with the property.

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.620
Bullshit!
Barred from my childhood home?

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.290
You never lived here.

01:23:38.370 --> 01:23:40.080
You abandoned her.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.790
You abandoned both of us.

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.920
Mr. Malone is willing
to be reasonable

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.500
and discuss a fair distribution
of assets.

01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:47.840
Once Lavender House is sold.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.260
You're Josephine's attorney.

01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.050
Ernie is Josephine's attorney.

01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:53.200
You work for the same law firm.
It's a conflict of interest.

01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:54.570
I'll be calling your partners
in the morning.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.100
You're gonna wanna prepare
for that.

01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:57.660
Just let us in
the goddamn house, will you?

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:00.270
Nobody is going in the house.

01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:01.910
Josephine will speak to you
at a meeting

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.650
that you will arrange in town.

01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:05.370
Meanwhile, the three of you
will get off this property

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.480
or I'll be calling the sheriff.

01:24:07.570 --> 01:24:09.650
Is there anything
I've said that's unclear?

01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:21.370
I'm calling the kids.

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:24.380
They're coming here,
and we're staying with you.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.540
Nobody is taking this house
from you.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.900
Hey, everybody,

01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:50.440
there's about 3,000 cars
pulling up the drive!

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:56.700
Oh, my God.

01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:59.700
Oh, my God.
I can't believe...

01:24:59.790 --> 01:25:01.660
Oh, my gosh.

01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:04.620
- Josephine! Oh!
- Amond!

01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:06.790
Damn.

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:09.000
I'm so glad you're here.

01:25:09.090 --> 01:25:11.380
I see why
you wouldn't wanna leave.

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.550
Come meet everybody.

01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:15.930
- Amber. Jake's daughter.
- Hi.

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.930
- How you doin', Amber?
- Connor, the oldest.

01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:19.240
- What's up, man?
- How you doin'?

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:20.680
- You alright?
- This is Ethan.

01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:22.640
- Jake's youngest.
- Ethan, what's going on?

01:25:22.730 --> 01:25:27.560
Oh. I get a hug?
Alright. Okay.

01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:30.900
- Awesome.
- And this is Jake.

01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:33.400
Oh, shoot.

01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:34.990
You're the Truck.

01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:37.360
Whoa, dad, he knows you.

01:25:37.450 --> 01:25:41.240
Josephine, you didn't tell me
that your fighter was the Truck.

01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:43.580
I saw you at Vegas
when you fought Di Matteo.

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:45.620
- You messed him up.
- You're a fight fan, huh?

01:25:45.710 --> 01:25:48.380
- Hell, yeah.
- Of course.

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:49.750
- Man.
- Good to meet you, man.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.860
Pleasure to meet you, too.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.000
Well, welcome. Come on in.

01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:54.050
- Alright.
- Yeah.

01:25:54.130 --> 01:25:56.760
- You look so good.
- Yeah. You look good, girl.

01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:01.560
- Phi, Josephine.
- Hey.

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:02.880
- So glad you came.
- It's cool.

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.190
Amber, you good? You eatin'?

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.830
Pleased to meet you.

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:27.670
See your friend's girl?

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:31.040
Your boy's over here
sweatin' her.

01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:33.130
Seein' as good
as she look at night.

01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:35.090
He noticed it,

01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:38.470
but he doesn't know
what to do with it.

01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:41.180
His blindfold been taken off.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:45.310
- What's goin' on? Good?
- How you doin'?

01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:47.390
I love this place.

01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:54.530
Connor's on the prowl,
target Sophie.

01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:58.240
- Mm, Amond pointed that out.
- Yeah.

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.990
Well, if something happens,
they'll be really cute together.

01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:03.740
Mm-hm. Well,
I remember what it was like

01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:05.080
to be a 17-year-old boy.

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.180
You remember what it's like

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.160
to be a 16-year-old girl?

01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:10.830
And newsflash, so does Alyssa.

01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:14.630
He tried the meatballs.

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.140
Yo, you're not gonna
believe this.

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:26.060
Dee Amond just walked in
and asked to see you.

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.230
Send him in.

01:27:30.810 --> 01:27:32.480
- What's up, brother?
- How you doin'?

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.980
- Good. And you?
- Good.

01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:37.780
I see you got yourself
a titty bar.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:39.950
Yup.

01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:44.080
What I wanna know is what's
going on with Josephine.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.040
Is there something that
she don't wanna tell me?

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.700
Yeah.

01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:50.100
Her uncle's contesting the will.

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.630
He's old,
but he's got a long history

01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:56.500
of being a supreme asshole.

01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:58.420
What's the deal with this uncle?

01:27:58.510 --> 01:28:01.090
Well, I was close
with her grandmother

01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:05.640
and she told me that she hasn't
spoken to her son in 28 years.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.220
Not since she got custody
of Josephine

01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:08.780
because her other son
was beating the hell

01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:10.980
out of his daughter.

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:12.650
The uncle's just in it
for the money.

01:28:12.730 --> 01:28:15.360
So her father used to put her
in the hospital?

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.650
Mm-hm. Yeah.

01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:19.150
But he's dead.
He died in prison.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.450
Unfortunately,
his brother didn't.

01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:23.570
I didn't know any of this shit.

01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:26.240
Does he have a name?

01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:28.450
Why?
You wading in?

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.830
Yeah.

01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:32.210
Alright.

01:28:32.290 --> 01:28:34.380
Davis Malone.

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:37.000
I think he's bankrolled
by Boston Stone.

01:28:37.090 --> 01:28:38.420
Some local big-man.

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.170
And their lawyer
works at the same firm

01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:42.220
that represents Josephine.

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:44.180
- That's conflict of interest.
- Mm-hm.

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.930
So with the other two,
how dirty do you want it?

01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:48.600
Hey, I just want her
breathin' easy.

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.770
That house is all she has left
of her grandmother.

01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:52.850
So where are you with dirty?

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:55.730
Oh...

01:28:55.810 --> 01:28:57.730
And my hand's gotta stay clean.

01:28:57.820 --> 01:28:59.900
I got three kids and Josie
to worry about.

01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:02.490
I'mma go take care
of the problem.

01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:03.930
In the meantime,
I'mma go out there

01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:06.030
and scope out
some of your talent.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.620
You do that.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:09.830
I got you.

01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:11.100
Alright.

01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:21.380
- Jake.
- Shh, shh. Keep the lights off.

01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:22.650
Grab your phone,
you hear something

01:29:22.670 --> 01:29:24.760
you don't like, call 911.

01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:31.560
Oh, my God.

01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:35.980
Yes. Uh...

01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:37.900
This is Josephine Malone.

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.610
Uh, 10, Lavender Lane.

01:29:40.690 --> 01:29:43.030
We're experiencing a-a break-in.

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:45.490
Hey, hey.

01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:49.030
Stop right there. Put it down.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.330
Drop it.

01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:54.580
Josie, hey, uh,
dad's got your uncle.

01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:56.750
What're you doing here? Hm?

01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:58.920
It's alright.

01:30:03.550 --> 01:30:05.720
Hey. Yeah. No, it's okay.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.140
The guy who broke in
is like 700 years old.

01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:10.890
Uh...

01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:14.230
Yeah, no, we understand.
Uh, thank you.

01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:16.940
Um, the police are on their way.

01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:20.320
- Stupid motion sensor lights.
- God, you're an idiot.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.080
What did you think
you were gonna accomplish?

01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:23.440
Respect your uncle, girl!

01:30:23.530 --> 01:30:24.630
Well, I would, if you'd give me

01:30:24.650 --> 01:30:26.820
one miniscule reason to do that.

01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:29.030
- Jake, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.320
The side window isn't.

01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:31.540
You're gonna pay for that.

01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:33.120
How? Give you blood?

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.410
Girl, I broke in so I can get
something to pawn

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.370
so I can get gas money
to get home.

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:40.130
That bitch lawyer got her ass
fired over conflict of interest

01:30:40.210 --> 01:30:41.810
and that Boston guy
isn't helping me out anymore.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.460
What the hell
do you want me to do?

01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:45.270
Well, you're gonna have
a free place to stay tonight.

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:48.800
Because I am absolutely
pressing charges.

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.680
I'm gonna make coffee.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.470
Jake, would you like
some coffee?

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.560
Yeah, babe.

01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:03.690
Got it.

01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:09.530
Hey, babe, I think you might
need to come here.

01:31:12.910 --> 01:31:14.510
You get the hell off my property
before I slap

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:15.790
a restraining order on you.

01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:17.160
I came to apologize.

01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:18.600
I was told
that if I apologize to you,

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.850
some unfortunate things
that have been

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.580
happening to me would disappear.

01:31:21.670 --> 01:31:24.040
Now, call off your guys.

01:31:24.130 --> 01:31:25.590
My guys?

01:31:25.670 --> 01:31:27.130
You know what I'm talking about.

01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:28.300
Tell them I apologized,

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.930
and this will all go away.

01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:32.510
Amond, babe.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:34.680
- Amond.
- Mm-hm.

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:39.390
Okay. Here's the deal.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.650
My uncle needs a ride home.

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:43.230
I'll drop the charges
against him

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:45.480
if you make sure he gets back.

01:31:45.570 --> 01:31:48.900
And give him plenty of financial
incentive to stay there.

01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:50.210
- Financial incentive, no.
- No?

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:52.320
Well, you got
yourself into this mess.

01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:56.500
Fine. I'll see to your uncle.

01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:59.100
Now. Just call them off
at your earliest convenience.

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.670
Of course,
but the Ravens are playing

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:03.380
and I really
like their uniforms.

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.710
So it'll have to be
after the game.

01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:13.100
Ooh!

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.330
Come on, Eth, let's go!

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.120
Hurry up!

01:32:52.130 --> 01:32:54.220
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:58.890
I love my days.

01:32:58.970 --> 01:33:01.770
I take Ethan to school,

01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:03.850
you opened the gym,

01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:05.810
and then this.

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:07.860
Mm...

01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:10.320
I got a kid coming in.

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.490
- I gotta get to work.
- Oh...

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.960
Oh, you make leaving hard.

01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.470
Put some clothes on, will ya?

01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:07.830
Hey, slick,
you seen my keys anywhere?

01:34:10.170 --> 01:34:12.260
Did gran give you these?

01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:16.800
What, you're going through
my desk?

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.390
The picture was out,
the letters were out.

01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:22.430
Did she give you these letters
and that picture?

01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:27.440
Yes.

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:31.320
Did you read them?

01:34:32.690 --> 01:34:34.780
- Josie...
- Did you read them, Jake?

01:34:37.450 --> 01:34:40.580
- Yes.
- How many times?

01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:41.990
W-why does that matter?

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.450
It matters to me.
How many times?

01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:46.620
Josie.

01:34:47.670 --> 01:34:51.170
Look, you knew, you knew
Lydie told me about you.

01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:54.210
I-I knew that
she told you about me.

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:56.720
I-I just didn't know
that she s-shared

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:59.390
all my private letters with you.

01:34:59.470 --> 01:35:01.640
Why would she do that?

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:03.810
When did she give these to you?

01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:07.350
Five or six years ago.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:13.230
Five or six years.

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.650
You've known this much about me
for five or six years?

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:18.280
Lydie did not betray you.

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.070
- You...
- Don't. Keep away from me.

01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:22.500
I swear to God, I'll leave
and you will never see me again.

01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:23.740
Okay, c-calm down. Alright?

01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:25.200
Just take a breath.
We can talk.

01:35:25.290 --> 01:35:27.290
I'm not gonna take a breath.

01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:30.000
Do you not find it strange?

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.460
She gave me to you
before she gave me to you.

01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:36.090
Every secret...

01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:39.590
E-everything that was mine
to give.

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:41.760
Yeah, well,
would you have given it?

01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:47.350
I would've liked to have
had the option.

01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:49.940
Even so,
if gran had some grand scheme

01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:52.270
which seems clear,

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.730
maybe you could've shared
that with me.

01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:56.650
Look...

01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:00.110
Look, it happened. Alright?
I mean, we are what we are now.

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.410
- So what does it matter?
- Because I have...

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:04.730
I have questions, and you're
the only person in this room

01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:07.100
with the answers, and you're not
giving them to me.

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.290
Why can't you tell me?

01:36:09.370 --> 01:36:11.710
Because it doesn't matter.

01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:13.750
You are keeping
something from me.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.710
Look, babe, you have all of me.

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:17.210
No.

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:19.760
- You got all of me.
- Alright, look, can we please...

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.340
We need to be able to move on
from this. Just let this go.

01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:25.430
No, we can't move on.

01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:27.670
Not until you tell me what you
and gran have been up to

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.890
for the last five or six years.

01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:31.350
We had your best interest
at heart.

01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:34.270
Yeah, if you did,
then I would've met you

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.690
instead of you and your kids
being kept from me.

01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:38.110
No one's been kept from anybody.

01:36:38.190 --> 01:36:39.630
- Why would she do this to me?
- Why?

01:36:39.690 --> 01:36:41.780
- Why?
- Let it go!

01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:54.420
How is it that we could be...

01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:57.460
as close as two people could get
half hour ago...

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.470
and now we're done?

01:37:39.170 --> 01:37:43.050
Look, I understand you don't
want to talk to me, but...

01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:45.890
the kids miss you.

01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:47.760
I miss you.

01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:49.930
Please call me.

01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:09.370
Josie stood me up for lunch.

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:11.370
Finally got through to her
late last night.

01:38:11.450 --> 01:38:14.540
She said things have changed.

01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:16.460
She's putting Lavender House
on the market,

01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:20.130
taking some job with some
designer in New York City.

01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:24.550
I'll take care of it.

01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:26.340
Well, you better hurry, Jake,

01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:28.430
because she didn't sound right.

01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:56.270
- Hello?
- Boy, I'm glad you picked up.

01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:58.600
Yeah, my Sophia's in the clink.

01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:02.100
- In jail?
- Well, school jail, with Connor.

01:40:02.190 --> 01:40:03.900
Apparently, Mia got all up
in his face

01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:05.400
about how he ruined her life,

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:07.280
and Sophia tried to help.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.650
I just got to the school.

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:09.950
Is Jake there?

01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:11.360
Girl,
I don't know where Jake is.

01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:14.030
- That's why I'm calling you.
- I'm coming.

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.290
Okay. Thank you.

01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:26.380
Magdalene High
School, how may I help?

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:28.550
Yes, that's correct.

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.590
- May I help you?
- Hi.

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.680
I-I'm here for Connor Spear.

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.810
Um, I'm his...
His, um, um...

01:40:37.890 --> 01:40:39.560
She's with me.

01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:10.760
Listen.

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.100
It was me
that refused to see you.

01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:18.810
Lydie told me,
I don't know how many times.

01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:21.140
The first time I walked
into Lavender House

01:41:21.230 --> 01:41:23.640
and I looked at your picture...

01:41:23.730 --> 01:41:26.690
I knew I could fall in love
with you and...

01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:28.690
and it scared me to death.

01:41:32.650 --> 01:41:34.740
And every word Lydie said
just made it worse.

01:41:37.370 --> 01:41:39.200
And I knew that if

01:41:39.290 --> 01:41:41.910
you didn't want what I had to
offer, that, uh...

01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:46.080
that it would gut me.

01:41:46.170 --> 01:41:48.250
And I couldn't let that happen,
so...

01:41:50.710 --> 01:41:53.680
Lydie gave me a picture.

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.840
And then she gave me
those letters.

01:41:59.510 --> 01:42:02.390
You are everything
I ever wanted.

01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:07.310
God, I love you!

01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:16.660
Oh...

01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:21.950
Gran, uh, left this in her
safety deposit box.

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.090
Josie, my buttercup.

01:42:31.170 --> 01:42:33.590
If you're listening to this,
I'm gone.

01:42:33.670 --> 01:42:37.930
And by the time you listen
to this, you'll have met Jake.

01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:42.100
I knew the moment I saw him
that he was perfect for you.

01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:45.140
I also knew from the expression
on his face

01:42:45.230 --> 01:42:46.900
when he first saw your picture.

01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:50.560
He knew you were perfect
for him, too.

01:42:50.650 --> 01:42:53.360
I wanted you to be happy,
buttercup.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:55.860
So I did what I needed to do.

01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:58.700
I gave you to Jake,

01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:03.620
and in doing so,
I gave Jake to you.

01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:07.460
My girl, know this,
and never forget.

01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:12.460
It's never too late
to reach for happiness.

01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:17.180
And last, Josie, thank you
for being the light of my life.

01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:21.010
I treasured you from the moment
you were born.

01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:22.890
Goodbye, my precious girl.

01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:28.560
I love you always, forever,
and completely.

01:43:36.650 --> 01:43:38.240
Hey, guys.

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.160
- Can Sophie come to dinner?
- Alexi, too?

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:45.160
I'll be exasperated if we don't
have cream puffs for dessert.

01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:46.540
Get in here.

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.580
Yes!

01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:51.000
- Ooh!
- Oh!

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.380
Oh, you'll love it.
