paraphrase from it.

27:35.379 --> 27:37.988

- I don't understand.

27:38.140 --> 27:40.215

- Hannah, it's identical.

'I've never seen this paper
before in my life.'

27:41.994 --> 27:43.143
This is not the paper
I turned in.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.386
Then why is this the only one

27:44.405 --> 27:45.663
I have with your name on it?

27:45.814 --> 27:47.164
I don't know,
but I can prove it.

27:47.315 --> 27:48.573
I have it right here
on my laptop.

27:48.726 --> 27:50.225
Okay, great,
so maybe this is

27:50.318 --> 27:51.743
Just all some sort
of misunderstanding.

- What's wrong?

28:00.404 --> 28:04.164
I even checked the trash bin,
it's gone.

28:04.258 --> 28:06.016
Well, as you know,
the school has

28:06.168 --> 28:08.686
A zero tolerance policy
when it comes to cheating.

28:08.837 --> 28:10.429
I have no choice but to give you
a zero on the assignment.

28:10.523 --> 28:13.248
But this term paper
is worth a third of my grade.

28:13.341 --> 28:14.766
Not only will that tank my grade

in jeopardy.'

this incident to the foundation.

it's gonna end well for you.

28:28.857 --> 28:30.949

with the foundation

how is that gonna go

save it to your jump drive?

28:42.555 --> 28:44.037
Or-or what about my desk top?

homework on my computer?

28:45.558 --> 28:48.016
No, I didn't. I..

- Oh my gosh, mom, that's it.
- What?

28:52.456 --> 28:54.214
I wanted to proof read it
during study hall

28:54.308 --> 28:55.791
So I emailed it to myself.

28:55.809 --> 28:56.716
That way I could pull it up

28:56.810 --> 28:58.068
On the computer at the library.

Please tell me you
saved that email.

29:00.147 --> 29:01.572
I deleted it from my inbox

29:01.799 --> 29:04.074
But it should still be
in my sent folder.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.486
Yeah. There it is.

29:07.638 --> 29:09.413
I'm gonna call
principal edwards.

29:11.066 --> 29:13.417

who did this.

I don't get it,
what does the janitor

29:22.486 --> 29:24.336

to do with your paper?

29:24.488 --> 29:25.837
Well, that's the thing,
he wasn't mugged.

29:25.990 --> 29:27.839
He was just knocked unconscious.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.825
Okay, so..

29:29.843 --> 29:31.326
So, that not a coincidence.

29:31.419 --> 29:32.752
He was knocked out for a reason.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.271
And I'm willing
to bet whoever did it

29:34.422 --> 29:36.756
Is the same person
that switched out my paper.

29:36.776 --> 29:39.668
So I just need to do is sneak
into the security room

29:39.761 --> 29:41.003
Search the security footage

29:41.096 --> 29:43.096
And I'll find out who it was.

29:43.190 --> 29:44.339
Told her it was a bad idea.

29:44.432 --> 29:46.784
It is not!
This will work.

29:46.935 --> 29:48.860
We just have to wait until lunch
when the library's empty.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.770
But there's always
a security guard in there.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.514
How are you gonna get him out?

29:52.607 --> 29:54.941

one of you comes in.

can't make out a face.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.506

you'll see a sweatshirt

that eli always wears.

have the same sweatshirt.

Look, hannah, I appreciate you
bringing this to my attention

31:15.616 --> 31:19.117
But the way you went about it
was completely inappropriate.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.785
You should have come to me
first with your suspicion

31:20.938 --> 31:22.528
Instead of sneaking around.

that eli is right.

to identify

in trouble like that again--

in that footage.

it still doesn't prove

32:15.417 --> 32:17.750

hannah.

32:17.770 --> 32:20.420
You would need actual footage
from mrs. Young's classroom

32:20.439 --> 32:22.681

in the classrooms.

delivered them.

tragic news.

Your fellow classmate

53:02.680 --> 53:05.497
Eli johnson,
passed away yesterday.

53:05.591 --> 53:07.349
'he had a peanut allergy.'

53:07.576 --> 53:10.260
'unfortunately, he was
in the library by himself'

53:10.413 --> 53:12.003
After school when it happened.

The janitor found him,
but just wasn't soon enough.

grief counselors'

Although, in light of
recent events

53:30.208 --> 53:31.949
I don't think it's
important anymore.

53:32.043 --> 53:34.043
Why? Who was it?

53:36.455 --> 53:37.213
Um..

53:39.032 --> 53:40.216
It was eli johnson.

[cellphone chimes]

54:14.252 --> 54:16.901
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

54:16.921 --> 54:18.328
Your mom heard from
principal edwards

54:18.481 --> 54:19.421
And asked me to check on you.

54:22.075 --> 54:23.342
Such an awful way to go.

54:26.839 --> 54:28.430
At least you're safe now.

54:28.582 --> 54:30.266
No, I'm not!

54:30.493 --> 54:32.993
James just sent me a photo of me
sleeping in my room.

54:33.012 --> 54:35.345
- What?
- He was in my house, scott.

54:35.439 --> 54:36.939
Standing over me, as I slept.

54:37.090 --> 54:39.182
- Let me see it.
- I can't.

54:39.277 --> 54:42.336
It was a chatflash, so it
deleted after I opened it.

54:42.429 --> 54:43.779
You know what this
means, right?

54:45.432 --> 54:48.617
Eli wasn't james.

54:48.769 --> 54:51.120
But he had to be. He was the one
logged into that computer.

54:51.271 --> 54:54.606
Or maybe someone logged in
as eli to frame him.

54:54.625 --> 54:56.583

then who the hell is it?

To do it, scott. They knew
how to get into my house.

55:07.621 --> 55:10.380
Which means they
could do it again at anytime.

55:10.533 --> 55:12.382
Is your mom working
a late shift tonight?

55:12.476 --> 55:15.293
She was supposed to,
but she's getting it covered.

55:15.313 --> 55:17.037
She said she'd be home at 5:00.

55:17.056 --> 55:18.981
That's still two
and a half hours away.

55:19.132 --> 55:21.708
I don't like the idea of leaving
you at your home by yourself.

55:21.802 --> 55:24.711
Especially if someone knows
how to get inside.

55:24.730 --> 55:26.805
I was thinking about
going to the gym.

55:26.899 --> 55:28.398
You wanna come?

55:28.492 --> 55:30.642
I don't really feel like
working out right now.

55:30.661 --> 55:32.995
Well, they have a pool and
saunas. You could use those.

No, they-they wouldn't
have them in that area.

Are you sure that
you didn't see anyone?

57:53.696 --> 57:55.804
No, when I went to check on her

All I heard was um..

57:57.883 --> 58:00.309
...Pounding and-and the door
was wedged shut.

more helpful.

come when you did, I..

58:35.495 --> 58:36.920
What can I say?

58:37.072 --> 58:38.305
I have perfect timing.

58:41.760 --> 58:43.593
And I'm not letting you go
anywhere. Okay?

You're gonna have to put up with
me for a long, long time, missy.

to help you.

It's not your fault.

59:01.539 --> 59:03.789
I'm just glad scott checked
on me when he did.

59:06.192 --> 59:09.619
He seems to have convenient
timing a lot, doesn't he?

59:09.772 --> 59:11.938
Don't you find it kinda weird
that every time you've had

59:11.957 --> 59:14.958
One of these "episodes,"
it's been when you're with him?

59:15.052 --> 59:18.628
That he's always conveniently
been there to help save the day?

59:18.722 --> 59:22.206
No, he hasn't. He wasn't there
when we got hit by that car..

59:22.301 --> 59:24.785
Yeah, but, I was the only one
that was actually hit.

59:24.803 --> 59:26.395
Someone he clearly sees
as a threat.

59:27.973 --> 59:29.472
Scott would never hurt anyone.

59:29.625 --> 59:30.548
I've known him my whole life.

59:30.642 --> 59:32.234
He's like a brother to me.

59:32.385 --> 59:33.885
That's the thing.

59:33.904 --> 59:36.463
I don't think he wants
to be your brother.

59:36.481 --> 59:37.964
- I think he's in love with you.
- What?

59:37.983 --> 59:40.801
No, no. Scott does not
look at me that way.

59:40.819 --> 59:42.578
You're just saying that
because you don't like him.

59:44.640 --> 59:45.581
Maybe.

59:50.070 --> 59:52.495
Look, I didn't mean to
upset you.

59:52.648 --> 59:54.815
You're probably right.

59:54.833 --> 59:56.316
How about we stop
talking about scott

59:56.335 --> 59:58.835
And we focus on
more important things?

Isn't your next class on
the other side of campus?

1:00:24.771 --> 1:00:26.622
Yeah, but I had to grab
something from my locker

1:00:26.773 --> 1:00:29.440
Real quick. Why?

1:00:29.460 --> 1:00:32.944
No reason.
I was just surprised to see you.

1:00:33.038 --> 1:00:34.779
- Okay.
- Oh, actually..

1:00:34.873 --> 1:00:36.523
I'm really glad you're here.

1:00:36.616 --> 1:00:38.133
Can I borrow your phone
really quick?

1:00:38.284 --> 1:00:39.968
I forgot to charge mine,
so it died

1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:43.380
And I wanna see if the neighbor
emailed me about the vpn.

1:00:43.532 --> 1:00:44.973
Wouldn't he email your mom?

1:00:45.125 --> 1:00:48.034
Uh, he said he would
email both of us.

1:00:48.053 --> 1:00:49.794
- Thanks.
- Hey, guys.

1:00:49.813 --> 1:00:52.372

Yeah, that final is going
to kick my butt.

- Could we do it at your place?
- Yeah, sure.

1:00:59.305 --> 1:01:01.047
Hannah, you in?

1:01:01.141 --> 1:01:02.640
Huh?

1:01:02.660 --> 1:01:05.385
For studying at jane's
after school?

1:01:05.404 --> 1:01:07.387
Oh, no, sorry, I can't today.

1:01:07.480 --> 1:01:08.664
Uh, you two have fun though.

1:01:20.493 --> 1:01:22.068
What're you doing?

1:02:12.471 --> 1:02:14.137
Where did you get this?

1:02:14.231 --> 1:02:16.231
Scott was over at my place
and he was acting really weird

1:02:16.458 --> 1:02:18.808
So I snooped
through his things and..

1:02:18.902 --> 1:02:20.235
...It's not all I found.

1:02:22.297 --> 1:02:24.072
Oh, my god.

1:02:24.299 --> 1:02:25.574
Kevin always thought
it could've been scott

1:02:25.725 --> 1:02:27.225
I just didn't want to
believe him.

1:02:27.319 --> 1:02:28.969
Really? What did kevin say?

1:02:28.987 --> 1:02:31.137
That he thought
he was in love with me.

1:02:31.156 --> 1:02:32.989
And it wasn't a coincidence
how all these "episodes"

1:02:33.141 --> 1:02:34.491
Happened when we were together.

1:02:34.585 --> 1:02:37.401
Makes sense. You kept focusing
on eli and the fact that

1:02:37.496 --> 1:02:39.646
He was at the bowling alley the
night we set up the clique app

1:02:39.664 --> 1:02:41.498
But so was scott and that would
be the perfect way

1:02:41.650 --> 1:02:42.591
For him to tell you
how he feels

1:02:42.742 --> 1:02:44.075
But then you started
dating kevin..

1:02:44.094 --> 1:02:46.094
Which he kept trying
to talk me out of.

1:02:46.321 --> 1:02:47.654
But something about this
doesn't make sense.

1:02:47.747 --> 1:02:49.598
If he has feelings for me
it would make sense

1:02:49.749 --> 1:02:51.099
Why he wants to hurt kevin,
but why would he wanna hurt me?

1:02:51.326 --> 1:02:52.993
I don't think
he wants to hurt you.

1:02:53.011 --> 1:02:54.603
I think he's just trying
to create these scenarios

1:02:54.830 --> 1:02:56.329
Where he can be your
knight in shining armor.

1:02:56.348 --> 1:02:57.606
But what about
switching out my paper

1:02:57.833 --> 1:02:59.257
And almost costing me
this scholarship?

1:02:59.351 --> 1:03:00.758
He didn't save me from that.

1:03:00.778 --> 1:03:02.852
He didn't even know
I emailed to myself.

1:03:03.005 --> 1:03:05.781
If you lose this scholarship,
you'll be going to palm vista..

1:03:06.008 --> 1:03:08.099
...With scott.

1:03:08.118 --> 1:03:09.284
That's why he said he was sorry.

1:03:09.511 --> 1:03:11.286
What?

1:03:11.437 --> 1:03:13.346
He texted me like, 20 minutes
ago saying he was sorry

1:03:13.365 --> 1:03:15.682
And when I asked what for,
he didn't respond.

1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:17.292
What did he say when you
confronted him?

1:03:17.519 --> 1:03:19.443
I didn't confront him,
I just came up with an excuse

1:03:19.463 --> 1:03:21.354
And then came here immediately.

1:03:21.373 --> 1:03:23.373
He's at my house alone
right now, hannah.

1:03:23.525 --> 1:03:27.360
But if he texted you, that means
he knows I have his things.

1:03:27.379 --> 1:03:28.970
- Where are you going?
- To confront him.

if that's safe.'

the cops first?

Yeah, I will,
after I talk to him.

1:03:44.804 --> 1:03:46.046
What're you doing?

1:03:46.064 --> 1:03:47.730
Well, I'm not going to
let you go alone.

1:03:47.883 --> 1:03:49.065

something crazy like this

1:03:49.217 --> 1:03:50.242

- No.

1:15:57.128 --> 1:15:59.703
I was gonna feel close to them
when I went to kenzer.

1:15:59.797 --> 1:16:02.114
And you stole that from me.

1:16:02.133 --> 1:16:03.373
No, I didn't.
You can still go to ken--

1:16:03.467 --> 1:16:05.226
No, I can't, hannah!

1:16:06.229 --> 1:16:07.469
You don't get it!

1:16:10.733 --> 1:16:12.458
[crying]

1:16:12.476 --> 1:16:15.144
I don't qualify for enough
financial aid.

1:16:15.296 --> 1:16:17.071
Okay? Because my stepdad
makes too much money

1:16:17.298 --> 1:16:19.298
But he's not gonna help me
at all because

1:16:19.317 --> 1:16:21.242
Once I turn 18,
I'm not his problem anymore.

Good, right?

1:16:45.009 --> 1:16:47.059
- You drugged me?
- 'I did.'

1:16:48.830 --> 1:16:50.730
That's the whole reason
I brought you here.

1:16:58.022 --> 1:16:59.780

1:18:32.542 --> 1:18:35.209
Okay.
You gotta wake up, baby.

1:18:35.436 --> 1:18:37.119
Wake up!

1:18:37.271 --> 1:18:40.214

hannah get away'

With her grades slipping,
and her cheating

1:18:49.450 --> 1:18:50.707
None of this
would have happened.

1:18:50.727 --> 1:18:52.226
I would have gotten
my scholarship

1:18:52.453 --> 1:18:53.285
And your daughter
wouldn't have gotten hurt.

1:18:53.304 --> 1:18:54.878
No one would've gotten hurt.

No, because I won't be
going to kenzer!

No. No, I'm sorry, you won't.

1:19:10.562 --> 1:19:12.747
You don't get it.
You don't get it at all.

1:19:14.584 --> 1:19:17.234
I'm doing this
for my mom and dad.

1:19:17.253 --> 1:19:18.644
I'm doing this
to make them proud.

1:19:18.737 --> 1:19:20.254
I need to go to kenzer
to make them proud!

1:19:20.405 --> 1:19:22.498
There has to be another way.
