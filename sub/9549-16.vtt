00:01.127 --> 00:02.526
<i>Previously on Monk...</i>

00:02.828 --> 00:05.696
Wait a minute. That's
new. Is this for me?

00:05.865 --> 00:07.594
Adrian, don't
open that.

00:07.667 --> 00:09.396
Promise me you won't
open it till Christmas.

00:09.469 --> 00:11.403
Okay. Put it back.

00:12.806 --> 00:14.034
Hello?

00:24.217 --> 00:26.447
<i>She must have been
meeting somebody.</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:28.548
But who?

00:29.022 --> 00:31.456
Was it a story
she was working on?

00:33.026 --> 00:34.220
I don't know.

00:34.294 --> 00:38.196
And I can't see it.
Why can't I see it?

00:39.065 --> 00:41.226
<i>I think you're
too close to it, Monk.</i>

00:41.634 --> 00:43.033
I know that
building.

00:43.103 --> 00:44.263
When was it,
12 years ago?

00:44.337 --> 00:46.635
Almost exactly.
The missing midwife.

00:46.706 --> 00:48.639
Do you remember the
doctor we were talking to?

00:48.707 --> 00:50.675
Nash, right?
He's our guest of honor.

00:50.743 --> 00:53.211
So, Adrian, you working
on any interesting cases?

00:53.278 --> 00:55.075
Mr. Monk, are you okay?
I'm seeing spots.

00:55.147 --> 00:56.375
Adrian, look at me.

00:56.448 --> 00:58.382
You've been
poisoned, Adrian.

00:58.450 --> 01:00.008
Somebody's trying
to kill you.

01:00.085 --> 01:02.349
So, how long?

01:02.654 --> 01:05.418
Two, maybe three days.

01:05.591 --> 01:08.856
We think that Kazarinski
shot Dr. Nash last Friday,

01:08.927 --> 01:11.919
and we think that he
poisoned Adrian Monk.

01:11.997 --> 01:15.330
He must be taken alive.
If he dies, Monk dies.

01:17.102 --> 01:19.332
Kazarinski! Police!

01:27.446 --> 01:28.538
Damn!

01:28.614 --> 01:32.015
Trudy's gift.
It's time to open it.

01:34.453 --> 01:35.818
<i>Hello, Adrian.</i>

01:35.888 --> 01:38.550
<i>If you're watching this,
it means I'm dead.</i>

01:38.624 --> 01:40.615
<i>I know we said we'd never
have any secrets,</i>

01:40.692 --> 01:43.388
<i>but there's something
I never told you.</i>

01:43.529 --> 01:46.225
<i>Something happened,
something terrible,</i>

01:46.465 --> 01:48.456
<i>years ago,
before we met.</i>

01:53.005 --> 01:54.996
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

01:55.441 --> 01:57.966
<i>Disorder and confusion
everywhere</i>

01:59.945 --> 02:02.140
<i>No one seems to care</i>

02:02.214 --> 02:03.238
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:03.315 --> 02:06.182
<i>Hey, who's in charge here?</i>

02:06.251 --> 02:08.241
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:10.089 --> 02:12.887
<i>Poison in the very air
we breathe</i>

02:13.392 --> 02:15.690
<i>You know what's in the water
that you drink?</i>

02:15.761 --> 02:16.785
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:16.862 --> 02:19.591
<i>It's amazing</i>

02:20.164 --> 02:21.688
<i>People think I'm crazy</i>

02:21.766 --> 02:23.358
<i>'cause I worry
all the time</i>

02:23.434 --> 02:25.834
<i>If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too</i>

02:26.704 --> 02:28.103
<i>You better pay attention</i>

02:28.172 --> 02:30.538
<i>Or this world
we love so much</i>

02:31.142 --> 02:34.111
<i>might just kill you</i>

02:34.745 --> 02:36.645
<i>I could be wrong now</i>

02:37.048 --> 02:38.845
<i>But I don't think so</i>

02:38.916 --> 02:41.248
<i>'Cause there's
a jungle out there</i>

02:41.586 --> 02:43.781
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:59.787 --> 03:02.483
Mr. Monk,
you have to push play.

03:05.426 --> 03:08.224
It's been over two hours.
It's okay.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.394
It's okay.

03:11.131 --> 03:12.257
Here we go.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.824
<i>I know you've always
idealized me.</i>

03:15.402 --> 03:18.235
<i>You know, you think
I'm some kind of saint.</i>

03:18.439 --> 03:20.839
<i>But, sweetheart,
I am not perfect.</i>

03:21.442 --> 03:23.069
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

03:24.411 --> 03:25.901
<i>A big mistake.</i>

03:26.447 --> 03:30.213
<i>It was 15 years ago,
before we met.</i>

03:31.452 --> 03:32.510
<i>I had an affair...</i>

03:51.437 --> 03:53.405
<i>...with my law professor.</i>

03:54.107 --> 03:57.599
<i>He was married at the time.
I swear I didn't know that.</i>

03:58.344 --> 04:00.107
<i>Anyway, we, um...</i>

04:01.214 --> 04:04.012
<i>Well, I was pregnant.</i>

04:28.374 --> 04:30.171
<i>I know you're disappointed.</i>

04:30.243 --> 04:34.475
<i>I didn't love him. I
didn't even really know him.</i>

04:35.548 --> 04:37.641
<i>But I loved being pregnant.</i>

04:38.418 --> 04:39.908
<i>It was a girl.</i>

04:40.386 --> 04:43.822
<i>She was born
January 2, 1983.</i>

04:46.893 --> 04:48.326
<i>She died the same day.</i>

04:50.196 --> 04:52.391
<i>She lived for nine minutes.</i>

04:53.800 --> 04:56.598
<i>I never saw her.</i>

05:01.741 --> 05:04.107
<i>Never saw her.</i>

05:08.748 --> 05:11.911
<i>Anyway, the father,
the professor,</i>

05:11.985 --> 05:14.749
<i>his name is
Ethan Rickover and...</i>

05:19.392 --> 05:20.449
Rickover.

05:20.525 --> 05:23.323
The remarkable Mr. Monk.
Good to see you again.

05:27.432 --> 05:30.162
<i>He's a judge now. He's just been
nominated to the Court of Appeals,</i>

05:30.235 --> 05:31.497
<i>which is why
I'm making this tape,</i>

05:31.570 --> 05:33.902
<i>because the woman who's been
missing all week, Wendy Stroud,</i>

05:33.972 --> 05:35.963
<i>she's the midwife
who delivered my daughter.</i>

05:39.044 --> 05:42.275
The missing midwife.
The missing midwife.

05:44.216 --> 05:46.741
I don't know what to think.
Tell me what to think.

05:46.818 --> 05:49.912
Why don't we just let it play? Hit play.

05:51.723 --> 05:54.191
<i>And Ethan called me
yesterday.</i>

05:54.459 --> 05:55.585
<i>Just out of the blue.</i>

05:55.660 --> 05:57.525
<i>I mean, I haven't talked
to him in over 10 years.</i>

05:57.596 --> 05:59.791
<i>And he wants
to meet me tomorrow.</i>

06:01.666 --> 06:02.928
<i>And I don't know.
Maybe...</i>

06:03.001 --> 06:05.629
<i>You know, maybe I'm
just being paranoid.</i>

06:07.939 --> 06:11.306
<i>But there was just something
in his voice. It just...</i>

06:13.545 --> 06:15.445
<i>It scared me, you know?</i>

06:15.747 --> 06:18.079
<i>And Ethan has a...
He has a dark side.</i>

06:18.150 --> 06:19.947
<i>I mean, I know it.
I've seen it.</i>

06:20.018 --> 06:21.952
<i>I know what
he's capable of.</i>

06:24.256 --> 06:25.518
<i>Anyway...</i>

06:27.225 --> 06:29.557
<i>That's why I'm
making this tape.</i>

06:29.795 --> 06:34.095
<i>And if I'm wrong, which I'm
sure I am, and nothing happens,</i>

06:34.166 --> 06:38.762
<i>then I'll just switch it out for that
digital watch that you've been asking for.</i>

06:42.407 --> 06:45.604
<i>But if I'm right
and something happens,</i>

06:47.813 --> 06:49.747
<i>I wanted you
to know everything.</i>

06:52.016 --> 06:54.246
<i>'Cause you deserve
to know everything.</i>

06:54.552 --> 06:55.814
<i>Adrian...</i>

06:57.588 --> 07:00.216
<i>You are more than
the love of my life,</i>

07:03.561 --> 07:05.153
<i>you are my life.</i>

07:08.432 --> 07:09.865
<i>You are</i>

07:13.637 --> 07:14.797
<i>my life.</i>

07:23.547 --> 07:25.640
Mr. Monk,
I'm so sorry.

07:27.485 --> 07:29.009
What are you doing?
Get Rickover.

07:29.086 --> 07:30.576
What are you
gonna do?

07:31.388 --> 07:32.446
Mr. Monk, let's just
call the Captain.

07:32.523 --> 07:33.854
Why didn't she tell me?

07:33.924 --> 07:35.255
Mr. Monk,
everybody has secrets.

07:35.326 --> 07:37.886
She loved you. She didn't
want to disappoint you.

07:37.962 --> 07:43.127
That tape had been on my
bookshelf this whole time.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.495
I'd been looking
at it for...

07:45.569 --> 07:48.299
For 12 years.

07:49.340 --> 07:51.501
Mr. Monk, look at you.
You can't go anywhere.

07:51.575 --> 07:54.135
I'm going. No, Mr. Monk,
come on. You're sick.

07:54.378 --> 07:55.970
I'm not gonna die.

07:57.414 --> 07:58.938
I'm not gonna die.

07:59.617 --> 08:01.084
Not yet.

08:04.321 --> 08:06.312
Judge Rickover,
I would like to return

08:06.390 --> 08:10.349
<i>to one of your earlier
decisions, Harurra v. California.</i>

08:10.761 --> 08:14.629
You were the Deputy Solicitor General
on that brief, is that correct?

08:14.698 --> 08:16.188
That's correct, Senator.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.960
That was
a death penalty case

08:18.035 --> 08:21.129
in which we held that
the prisoner, Mr. Harurra,

08:21.639 --> 08:24.368
was entitled only to relief

08:24.641 --> 08:25.938
in the clemency process.

08:26.009 --> 08:28.102
And is that an opinion
you still hold?

08:28.178 --> 08:30.271
To be honest, Senator,
I'm not sure.

08:31.147 --> 08:33.240
The law has changed.
I have changed.

08:33.316 --> 08:35.876
I was 28 years old then,
thought I knew everything.

08:37.253 --> 08:38.618
You're aware,
of course,

08:38.688 --> 08:40.986
that there are
cases pending

08:41.057 --> 08:43.321
which have similar
circumstances,

08:43.393 --> 08:46.851
and some of them involve
recent advances in DNA evidence.

08:50.233 --> 08:51.598
Judge Rickover?

08:54.137 --> 08:57.834
Senator, I don't think it's a good
idea to rewrite the Constitution

08:57.907 --> 09:00.398
just because there's been
a scientific breakthrough.

09:01.177 --> 09:04.635
The basic principles of
common law haven't changed.

09:04.847 --> 09:06.314
They never do.

09:06.449 --> 09:09.509
The issue is application

09:10.520 --> 09:11.782
in a new context.

09:12.989 --> 09:15.184
And is context always
the overriding factor?

09:18.294 --> 09:19.556
Excuse me?

09:19.629 --> 09:22.860
Is context always
the overriding factor?

09:23.233 --> 09:25.701
In my opinion, yeah.
These are the same

09:26.703 --> 09:30.104
basic principles that have
animated our common law system

09:30.173 --> 09:31.538
since the time
of John Cook.

09:31.608 --> 09:35.100
But then again, I'm not here to
teach you high school civics, am I?

09:35.278 --> 09:37.143
Actually,
I wish you would.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.305
I think some of us
could certainly use it.

09:39.482 --> 09:41.416
Senator, it's been
a long morning.

09:41.484 --> 09:44.885
If I might, could I ask
for a brief recess?

09:45.021 --> 09:47.285
I think that's an excellent
idea. We could all use some air.

09:47.490 --> 09:49.549
We will reconvene at 10:15.

10:01.103 --> 10:03.537
Well, Mr. Monk,
what a surprise.

10:03.972 --> 10:05.997
I heard you were sick.
No, no.

10:06.308 --> 10:10.836
No, I'm... I'm feeling much
better. Much, much better.

10:11.780 --> 10:12.974
That's a relief.

10:13.615 --> 10:16.243
So, you came all the way
downtown just to cheer me on.

10:16.418 --> 10:17.715
Uh-uh.
That's nice.

10:17.786 --> 10:20.220
I'm here because
you killed my wife.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.689
I'm sorry?
You heard me.

10:28.030 --> 10:31.693
Trudy Ellison, she was a
student of yours at Berkeley.

10:32.301 --> 10:34.360
You had an affair with her.
She got pregnant.

10:34.770 --> 10:36.294
And 12 years ago,

10:36.371 --> 10:38.339
when you were nominated
for the appellate court,

10:38.407 --> 10:41.570
you made sure
that story never got out.

10:41.877 --> 10:43.174
You killed two women.

10:43.245 --> 10:44.712
Wendy Stroud...
Uh-huh.

10:44.780 --> 10:46.475
...who was the midwife
at the birth,

10:48.150 --> 10:49.549
and my wife.

10:52.688 --> 10:54.246
Well, they told me
to expect this.

10:54.323 --> 10:56.621
They said that at
every confirmation hearing,

10:56.692 --> 10:59.320
the nuts just come out
of the woodwork.

10:59.394 --> 11:02.192
Judge Rickover,
we know the whole story.

11:03.432 --> 11:04.899
Oh, really?

11:06.068 --> 11:09.560
Mr. Monk, I taught thousands
of students at Berkeley.

11:09.638 --> 11:11.401
Some of them were unstable.

11:11.473 --> 11:13.737
More than just a few
had crushes on me.

11:13.809 --> 11:15.868
But please,
where's your proof?

11:15.977 --> 11:17.569
Where's the child?

11:18.080 --> 11:20.071
The baby died.
Baby died.

11:20.382 --> 11:22.247
Birth records?
Paper trail?

11:22.317 --> 11:24.911
Gone. It's all gone.
You took care of that.

11:24.986 --> 11:29.012
You sent Joey Kazarinski to
the birthing center last week.

11:29.090 --> 11:30.284
They were updating
their files.

11:30.358 --> 11:32.690
The director must have
found something about Trudy,

11:32.827 --> 11:35.057
about the baby,
so you had him killed.

11:35.129 --> 11:38.394
You have been covering
your tracks for 26 years.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.193
No, it's all right. It's
all right. It's all right.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.792
Mr. Monk is sick.
He's seriously ill.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.770
He's obviously
not thinking straight.

11:45.206 --> 11:46.935
She made a tape.

11:48.776 --> 11:52.507
Judge, she made a tape.

11:57.618 --> 11:59.051
Of course she did.

12:00.054 --> 12:02.284
The woman was delusional.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.689
I remember.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.352
Trudy...

12:06.427 --> 12:07.416
Ellison.

12:07.495 --> 12:09.759
Ellison, yes.
She used to follow me around.

12:09.830 --> 12:13.197
She wrote me letters, phone calls
at 2:00, 3:00 in the morning.

12:13.434 --> 12:16.301
I remember that she also
claimed she was pregnant.

12:16.470 --> 12:17.698
She probably
believed it, too.

12:17.772 --> 12:20.764
She was quite
an unstable woman.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.308
Apparently you had
a lot in common.

12:23.411 --> 12:25.379
No, Mr. Monk.
Mr. Monk, no!

12:25.579 --> 12:27.410
Mr. Monk.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.915
No, Mr. Monk, stop!
Mr. Monk, please.

12:40.094 --> 12:41.584
Get him
out of here.

12:42.396 --> 12:44.159
This is not over!

12:46.367 --> 12:47.925
This is not over!

12:48.936 --> 12:50.028
Yes, it is.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.470
Yeah, I know.
The doctor's in with him now.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.709
We still don't know.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.242
All right, I'll call
you later. I love you.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.009
Who was that?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.119
That was the
Deputy Commissioner.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.985
Deputy Commissioner
Patrick Watson.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.419
Yeah, that's right.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.994
You said, "I love you. "

13:17.030 --> 13:18.895
I do love him.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.066
I think he's doing
a great job. I mean...

13:21.134 --> 13:22.192
Why? Why?
You don't think he's...

13:22.268 --> 13:25.169
No, I think he's doing a fine job.
I don't tell him that I love him.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.203
Well, maybe you should.
It's just common courtesy.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.304
It's not common courtesy.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.668
Well, I think you're
doing a great job.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.477
I love you.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.708
Okay, Randy,
I'm sorry I asked.

13:38.785 --> 13:41.549
When you're ready to tell me
what's really going on, don't.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.679
Doctor, how's our boy?

13:44.057 --> 13:45.149
He's stable.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.453
Actually, he's better
than stable.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.118
His vital signs
have improved.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.285
We're not sure why.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.761
That would be
the hatred.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.230
Pure malice, it's the
best medicine in the world.

13:53.299 --> 13:54.926
Can we see him?
Yeah.

13:58.037 --> 13:59.470
That was easy.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.632
Four days ago,
you were a bucking bronco.

14:01.708 --> 14:04.700
Four days ago
was years ago.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.779
I'll be back later
with your pills.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.282
Five minutes. Don't
get him excited. Okay.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.943
Hey.
Hey.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.283
Where's...
Where's Natalie?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.547
She's back at your place
getting your clothes.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.585
You mean
I can't go home?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.821
Buddy, you're lucky
you're not in jail. Huh?

14:22.896 --> 14:26.832
You've been charged with assault
and threatening a sitting judge.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.900
Yeah, some judge.

14:30.836 --> 14:33.361
We know. We've been digging around.

14:33.572 --> 14:34.596
It all checks out.

14:34.673 --> 14:36.300
Dr. Nash had
a second cell phone.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.468
He called Rickover
half a dozen times.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.136
We figure he was trying
to blackmail him.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.544
Rickover hired Kazarinski
to kill him.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.345
Give him the file.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.044
I'll just leave it there.

14:49.821 --> 14:51.948
You got him.
You found him.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.248
How's it feel?

14:55.160 --> 14:56.752
It's not over.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.796
It's... It's not over.

15:00.098 --> 15:02.760
Just the air, the air
that I'm breathing,

15:02.834 --> 15:05.894
I hate the thought that
he's breathing that same air.

15:05.971 --> 15:09.236
I know, buddy.
Look, we're gonna get him.

15:10.008 --> 15:12.568
I promise you.
This is me promising you

15:12.644 --> 15:14.544
the son of a bitch
is going down.

15:16.214 --> 15:18.614
Randy, close the door.

15:19.851 --> 15:21.375
Close the door.

15:23.522 --> 15:26.116
Leland, listen,

15:28.694 --> 15:29.752
I won't be there.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.796
Oh, nonsense.
Don't talk like that.

15:31.863 --> 15:33.387
Don't give up.
Nobody's giving up.

15:33.465 --> 15:34.727
The doctors are working
around the clock.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.165
This is...
Leland...

15:42.040 --> 15:43.302
Kill him.

15:44.576 --> 15:45.941
Promise me.

15:53.585 --> 15:55.382
Yes, all right, I...

15:57.055 --> 15:58.386
I promise.

15:59.324 --> 16:02.315
Yes, I'll do it.
There won't be a trial.

16:06.263 --> 16:07.787
You're lying.

16:16.974 --> 16:19.340
Sweetie, that's the wrong pillow. It is?

16:19.410 --> 16:20.775
Yeah, he needs
his Trudy pillow.

16:20.845 --> 16:23.040
It's in the closet.
It's in a plastic case.

16:23.314 --> 16:25.976
She slept on it
and he can still smell her.

16:28.486 --> 16:30.613
Wow.
Is that Trudy's car?

16:31.589 --> 16:34.786
Yeah. Well,
at least he knows.

16:36.327 --> 16:39.296
If he doesn't make it,
at least he'll die knowing.

16:53.177 --> 16:54.974
What are you doing?

16:55.913 --> 16:59.007
There's something missing
here. There's something wrong.

16:59.083 --> 17:02.246
I'll tell you what's wrong.
You shouldn't be sitting up.

17:02.319 --> 17:05.288
Look at you.
You're agitating yourself.

17:05.556 --> 17:07.455
I'm sure
whatever it is can wait.

17:07.525 --> 17:09.083
Oh, not this one.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.355
It can't wait,
not this one.

17:12.029 --> 17:14.554
This guy killed
three people.

17:14.765 --> 17:16.232
This man?

17:16.934 --> 17:18.595
You never can tell,
can you?

17:18.669 --> 17:21.297
No. He's covering up
an affair he had.

17:21.372 --> 17:23.396
Is that all?
Doesn't seem right.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.567
Nobody cares about
affairs anymore.

17:25.643 --> 17:29.170
That's what I was thinking.
There's got to be something else.

17:29.513 --> 17:31.946
There has to be
more to it.

17:33.016 --> 17:35.075
Now, Doctor wants you
to sleep tonight.

17:35.151 --> 17:38.143
I'm leaving this here.
It'll put you right out.

17:38.221 --> 17:40.348
Sleep is the best medicine.

17:41.758 --> 17:43.817
"He'll never move. "

17:43.927 --> 17:46.327
Pardon me?
That's what they said.

17:46.396 --> 17:48.159
I heard them talking.

17:48.898 --> 17:50.525
Ethan will never move.

17:51.101 --> 17:52.500
I think he's gonna
be buried in this yard.

17:53.369 --> 17:55.269
So why won't he move?

17:57.440 --> 17:59.931
What is it
about that house?

18:05.782 --> 18:07.647
Wait, he'll want this.

18:08.084 --> 18:10.211
If we forgot anything,
we can always come back.

18:12.722 --> 18:13.950
Steven. Natalie, are you all right?

18:14.023 --> 18:16.014
I don't know.
I don't feel so good.

18:16.092 --> 18:19.186
Spots. I'm seeing spots.
Oh, my God.

18:19.262 --> 18:21.059
It's the poison.
It's the same as Mr. Monk.

18:21.131 --> 18:23.599
I don't understand. I've been with
you all day, you haven't eaten a thing.

18:23.666 --> 18:25.566
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

18:25.635 --> 18:27.660
Natalie?
Babe, what is it?

18:27.737 --> 18:29.762
Rickover. Ethan Rickover at the hearing.

18:29.839 --> 18:31.807
Mr. Monk dropped a wipe.

18:32.175 --> 18:33.472
I thought
you were sick.

18:33.543 --> 18:37.035
I'm feeling much better.
Much, much better.

18:37.180 --> 18:39.512
<i>He used his pen.
He didn't want to touch it.</i>

18:39.616 --> 18:41.675
Oh, God.
It was in the wipes.

18:41.751 --> 18:43.616
That's how we missed it.
We assumed it was the food.

18:43.686 --> 18:45.017
We got to get you
to the hospital.

18:45.088 --> 18:46.783
We have a source now.
We can break it down.

18:46.856 --> 18:48.414
We'll have an antidote
in two hours.

18:48.491 --> 18:49.890
I'll get Mr. Monk.
He'll be fine.

18:49.959 --> 18:51.449
You got to tell him.
You got to call him.

18:51.528 --> 18:52.859
Okay, I'm calling.

18:55.832 --> 18:57.697
Nurse's station.
This is Judy.

18:58.168 --> 18:59.795
You can call him directly.

19:00.336 --> 19:02.963
Really?
Okay. I'll go check.

19:08.443 --> 19:10.968
Kenny.
Kenny, what happened?

19:28.197 --> 19:29.289
Is it raining out there?

19:29.364 --> 19:30.991
It's really coming down.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.301
Captain, there you are. Been
looking all over for you.

19:34.536 --> 19:36.003
You haven't heard?
Heard what?

19:36.071 --> 19:37.663
There's a cure.

19:38.273 --> 19:39.365
There's a cure?
Yeah, for Monk.

19:39.441 --> 19:41.773
They isolated the poison.
It was on his wipes.

19:41.944 --> 19:43.411
The wipes!

19:43.745 --> 19:45.303
That's great news.
There's a cure.

19:45.380 --> 19:47.507
Come on, I was just on my way to
the hospital. We can celebrate.

19:47.583 --> 19:48.607
He's not there.

19:48.684 --> 19:50.413
Who's not there?
Monk. He escaped.

19:50.485 --> 19:52.612
And he drugged a cop
and took his gun.

19:53.055 --> 19:54.682
Okay, come on, let's go.
We can take your car.

19:54.756 --> 19:56.053
Where are we going?
To stop Monk.

19:56.124 --> 19:57.955
From doing what?
The wrong thing.

20:15.177 --> 20:17.008
Your garage was open.

20:17.379 --> 20:19.176
I borrowed a shovel.

20:22.918 --> 20:24.385
Pick it up.

20:26.321 --> 20:27.811
Pick it up!

20:32.294 --> 20:33.351
Over there.

20:33.427 --> 20:34.917
Are you gonna kill
a federal judge?

20:34.996 --> 20:37.658
Tonight, I'm the judge.

20:38.165 --> 20:40.531
Over there, let's go.
Let's go.

20:48.476 --> 20:51.206
Good, good, good. Step on
it! Step on it! Step on it!

20:53.481 --> 20:55.472
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Car, car, car!

20:55.549 --> 20:57.039
Just go! Go!

21:03.257 --> 21:05.555
Jeez.
Sorry, sorry.

21:06.794 --> 21:08.261
Look over there!
Look out.

21:09.130 --> 21:10.154
Where the hell
is the siren?

21:10.231 --> 21:11.596
In the back.

21:11.666 --> 21:12.860
What's it doing
in the back?

21:12.934 --> 21:14.333
I haven't used it
in 10 months.

21:14.402 --> 21:16.666
Why, did you think
the bad guys all retired?

21:16.737 --> 21:18.398
That crime is over?

21:18.472 --> 21:20.997
The hell?
What is all this crap?

21:21.242 --> 21:22.402
Yard sale.

21:22.476 --> 21:23.568
You bought all this?

21:23.644 --> 21:24.702
No, I'm selling it.

21:24.779 --> 21:26.576
You're selling
all of this?

21:27.381 --> 21:29.576
Hey, are these my barbells?

21:30.351 --> 21:31.443
No, those are mine.

21:31.519 --> 21:33.817
No, I lent you my barbells last
year. These are my barbells.

21:33.888 --> 21:35.412
I bought the same ones.

21:35.589 --> 21:37.022
With my initials on them?

21:37.358 --> 21:39.553
Oh, okay, maybe those
are yours. Just take them.

21:39.994 --> 21:42.428
I'm not gonna take them now.
We're in the middle of a thing.

21:43.030 --> 21:44.497
I can't find the siren.

21:47.001 --> 21:48.332
I might've sold it.

21:52.039 --> 21:53.631
All right, Detective Monk, what now?

21:53.708 --> 21:54.868
Dig.

21:57.445 --> 21:59.777
I think both of us are
gonna be dead by morning.

21:59.847 --> 22:01.314
I said dig.

22:02.316 --> 22:03.715
Not there.

22:03.784 --> 22:07.947
Over there, by the sundial.
Over there.

22:09.089 --> 22:10.579
Let's go.

22:13.727 --> 22:15.024
Go on.

22:16.796 --> 22:17.956
Go on!

22:22.102 --> 22:24.536
No, no, no, don't take Vinton!
What the hell, are you crazy?

22:24.604 --> 22:27.095
It's left. I gotta go left.
They got it all tore up!

22:28.708 --> 22:31.871
Oh! Oh, jeez.
Sorry, sorry.

22:31.945 --> 22:33.503
Go left, go left,
go left!

22:33.747 --> 22:34.907
Good.

22:35.148 --> 22:36.945
Step on it, step on it,
step on it!

22:37.350 --> 22:40.046
A squad car is already here.
Monk's gonna get himself shot.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.883
What the hell?
Look out!

22:44.724 --> 22:46.089
Come on,
come on, come on!

22:47.260 --> 22:48.989
Move the truck!
Police emergency!

22:52.032 --> 22:53.761
Damn!
Come on, come on!

22:56.636 --> 22:58.263
Guess we got a siren.

23:03.977 --> 23:05.308
Keep digging.

23:05.378 --> 23:07.107
Sir, I'm not gonna
tell you again.

23:07.213 --> 23:08.976
I want you to put
the weapon down.

23:09.382 --> 23:10.781
We're not done yet.

23:15.288 --> 23:17.984
I'm gonna bring up
a sore subject here.

23:18.224 --> 23:19.418
I don't want you
to overreact,

23:19.492 --> 23:22.461
but Trudy and I used to talk about
capital punishment all the time,

23:22.529 --> 23:23.655
and she never
believed in it.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.789
Shut up!
Just shut it.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.597
You mention
her name again,

23:29.035 --> 23:31.833
it'll be the last word
you'll ever say.

23:31.905 --> 23:33.236
Oh, God. Okay.

23:33.773 --> 23:36.297
Stottlemeyer, homicide.
You guys just relax.

23:37.076 --> 23:39.476
Everybody...
Everybody take a deep breath.

23:39.545 --> 23:40.876
Relax. Hold your fire.

23:40.946 --> 23:42.743
Okay, that's close enough.
Monk!

23:43.182 --> 23:45.776
Monk, put the gun down, buddy.
You don't want to do this.

23:45.851 --> 23:47.079
You don't have
to do this.

23:47.152 --> 23:49.746
Hey, who told you to stop?

23:50.089 --> 23:51.681
Keep going! Keep going!

23:51.757 --> 23:55.056
Monk, Monk, listen to me.
They've identified the poison.

23:55.127 --> 23:57.220
It was on your wipes, Monk.
It was on your hand wipes.

23:57.296 --> 23:59.787
They have the antidote. We
have to get you to a hospital.

23:59.865 --> 24:01.492
We can figure out
what to do with him later.

24:04.470 --> 24:06.062
What was that?

24:07.473 --> 24:10.306
That is Wendy Stroud.

24:11.376 --> 24:13.674
The midwife from
12 years ago?

24:13.846 --> 24:14.904
Yeah.

24:19.718 --> 24:20.707
Bones.

24:21.620 --> 24:22.678
It's a human skull.

24:24.857 --> 24:27.621
I couldn't figure out
why he wouldn't move.

24:27.693 --> 24:28.853
Get CSI
down here now.

24:28.927 --> 24:33.125
And then I remembered there
was a sundial under the tree.

24:33.198 --> 24:35.689
Why would anyone
put a sundial

24:36.335 --> 24:39.099
under a big tree like this
in the shade?

24:39.271 --> 24:41.136
Didn't make any sense.

24:42.407 --> 24:46.867
Twelve years ago, when he was
nominated for the federal bench,

24:47.412 --> 24:49.846
his name was
in all the papers.

24:49.915 --> 24:53.874
Wendy Stroud must
have seen it, right?

24:55.120 --> 24:57.213
Right? She said she found Jesus.

24:57.289 --> 24:58.813
That she was born again.

24:58.891 --> 25:01.291
She couldn't live
with her guilt.

25:02.461 --> 25:06.329
She was gonna tell everyone
about me and Trudy and the child.

25:06.999 --> 25:08.761
So you killed her.

25:10.668 --> 25:12.135
And then Trudy.

25:13.938 --> 25:14.996
And for what?

25:16.774 --> 25:18.139
For nothing!
Monk.

25:19.343 --> 25:20.867
Monk, Monk.
For a job!

25:20.945 --> 25:22.435
Monk, don't, don't.
For a job!

25:22.647 --> 25:23.773
For...

25:26.317 --> 25:28.148
For a job.

25:30.888 --> 25:32.412
Hey, hey, Rickover,
put the gun down.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.355
No, no.
You take care of her.

25:51.809 --> 25:52.969
I think I'm gonna cry.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.878
The last time you were here,
what was that, two weeks ago?

25:56.948 --> 25:58.245
A week and a half.
A week and a half,

25:58.316 --> 26:00.011
and you looked horrible.

26:00.084 --> 26:01.142
Oh.

26:01.219 --> 26:03.312
And now look at you.
You look great.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.446
It's like a miracle.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.013
It was a miracle.

26:07.325 --> 26:09.759
So, finally,

26:11.462 --> 26:15.728
after 12 years,
12 long years,

26:17.335 --> 26:18.597
closure.

26:20.104 --> 26:21.799
Closure.
How do you feel?

26:22.306 --> 26:24.672
Fine. I'm good.

26:24.742 --> 26:26.039
Mmm-hmm.

26:27.778 --> 26:29.143
So how do you feel?

26:30.414 --> 26:32.507
I know how I'm
supposed to feel.

26:33.784 --> 26:38.118
I'm supposed to feel like I'm
finally happy, finally at peace.

26:38.655 --> 26:40.054
Mmm-hmm. But?

26:43.159 --> 26:45.821
I feel empty.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.988
Well, that's not surprising.

26:48.765 --> 26:51.097
Adrian, you've spent
most of your adult life

26:51.167 --> 26:53.567
looking for the man
who killed your wife.

26:53.770 --> 26:55.533
See, that search
kept you going.

26:56.773 --> 26:59.503
Now it's gone.
So what's next?

27:00.477 --> 27:02.809
What do you do
when you wake up tomorrow?

27:02.879 --> 27:04.403
What do you care about?

27:04.481 --> 27:06.813
See, now, these, these
are the difficult choices.

27:08.351 --> 27:09.579
There's something else.

27:11.154 --> 27:13.714
There's something
that's been nagging me.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.953
Just before
Ethan Rickover died,

27:18.328 --> 27:21.491
he said,
"Take care of her. "

27:22.032 --> 27:23.499
Take care of who?

27:24.167 --> 27:25.691
I don't know.

27:26.803 --> 27:28.566
I'll probably never know.

27:29.539 --> 27:31.404
All right.
You want my advice?

27:31.508 --> 27:34.306
And I assume you do
because you're here.

27:34.411 --> 27:37.209
Let it go. All right?
It's ancient history.

27:37.280 --> 27:40.909
It's time for Adrian Monk to
set sail into the great unknown.

27:42.585 --> 27:44.485
I hate the great unknown.

27:45.322 --> 27:47.756
How do you know?
It's unknown.

27:47.824 --> 27:49.758
If it's unknown, how do
you know it's so great?

27:50.360 --> 27:51.827
Good point.

27:51.995 --> 27:54.725
Maybe it's the not-so-great
unknown, huh?

27:55.632 --> 27:57.361
But it's out there.

27:57.834 --> 27:59.267
And it's waiting for you.

27:59.336 --> 28:02.032
And there's no reason
for you to be afraid of it.

28:11.580 --> 28:13.639
Mr. Monk,
what should I write?

28:14.983 --> 28:17.713
Mr. Monk, what should
I write on the box?

28:18.520 --> 28:19.987
Case closed.

28:20.155 --> 28:22.851
"Case closed. "
I like the sound of that.

28:25.494 --> 28:27.086
Oh, shoot,
the "E" is crooked.

28:27.162 --> 28:29.357
Is that okay, or should
I get another box?

28:30.966 --> 28:33.867
Mr. Monk?
What are you reading?

28:33.936 --> 28:36.370
Oh. Uh...

28:36.438 --> 28:38.030
"Midwife still missing.
Presumed dead. "

28:38.107 --> 28:40.803
It's an old article
about Wendy Stroud.

28:41.343 --> 28:43.311
It was on the bottom
of this section.

28:43.379 --> 28:47.782
"Miss Stroud made headlines
15 years ago, January 2, 1983,

28:47.850 --> 28:50.410
"when she found
a newborn infant girl

28:51.487 --> 28:54.945
"on a playground and brought
it to a local orphanage. "

28:59.428 --> 29:01.089
1983?

29:03.899 --> 29:05.560
"Take care of her. "

29:05.634 --> 29:07.693
Excuse me?
Rickover's last words.

29:08.170 --> 29:10.263
It wasn't the
affair, Natalie.

29:10.406 --> 29:13.398
This is what he was
covering up. It was the baby.

29:13.942 --> 29:16.570
It didn't die.
The baby lived.

29:16.645 --> 29:19.011
Trudy didn't know it.
She never knew it.

29:19.481 --> 29:20.914
They lied to her.

29:21.016 --> 29:24.144
Her daughter lived and they
put her up for adoption.

29:26.555 --> 29:29.752
She's alive
and she's out there somewhere.

29:34.296 --> 29:35.923
Trudy's daughter.

29:42.970 --> 29:44.232
Uh-huh.

29:46.274 --> 29:47.502
Uh-huh.

29:47.775 --> 29:50.608
Oh, he's standing right
here. I'll tell him.

29:54.582 --> 29:56.072
Are you ready?

29:56.784 --> 29:59.184
They found her.
Her name is Molly.

29:59.253 --> 30:00.277
Molly.

30:00.354 --> 30:01.719
Molly Evans.

30:02.056 --> 30:04.217
She was adopted
25 years ago

30:04.292 --> 30:06.385
by Andrew and
Beth Evans.

30:06.461 --> 30:08.929
She is unmarried. She
lives in Monterey County.

30:08.996 --> 30:11.931
<i>And get this, she writes movie
reviews for the Chronicle.</i>

30:12.099 --> 30:13.760
That makes sense.
Trudy was a writer.

30:13.901 --> 30:16.802
Monterey County,
that's 20 minutes away.

30:16.871 --> 30:19.271
Yeah, family services
has already contacted her,

30:19.340 --> 30:21.535
and she would
love to meet you.

30:24.979 --> 30:26.412
I can't do it.
Sure you can.

30:26.547 --> 30:28.708
No, what if she
doesn't like me?

30:28.850 --> 30:30.715
I mean, a lot of people
don't like me.

30:30.785 --> 30:32.810
I mean, I'm not
crazy about me.

30:33.588 --> 30:34.885
I can't do it.

30:36.023 --> 30:37.183
I'm not doing it.

30:37.291 --> 30:39.885
I'd rather keep things
the way they are.

30:40.294 --> 30:41.955
I like things
the way they are.

30:42.763 --> 30:44.060
No, you don't.

30:44.565 --> 30:46.226
Mr. Monk,

30:46.968 --> 30:48.629
you have to go.

30:48.936 --> 30:51.268
I'm telling you,
you have to go.

30:51.672 --> 30:53.663
This is a gift,
Mr. Monk.

30:55.643 --> 30:57.508
Trudy sent you a gift.

30:58.846 --> 31:01.041
She sent you
someone to love.

31:02.216 --> 31:04.446
It's what you've
been missing.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.554
I'll see you later.

32:21.294 --> 32:22.522
Molly?

32:23.029 --> 32:24.326
Yeah.

32:36.810 --> 32:38.141
It's okay.

32:38.745 --> 32:40.110
It's okay.

32:50.756 --> 32:52.849
Yeah, this is her
parallel parking.

32:52.925 --> 32:55.189
Yeah. She's an
excellent driver.

32:55.260 --> 32:57.387
She's never had
a single parking ticket.

32:57.463 --> 33:00.125
Yeah, here we are.
This is us having lunch.

33:00.199 --> 33:02.497
Yeah. She eats out five times a week.

33:02.568 --> 33:04.502
She's vegetarian,
but she eats fish.

33:04.570 --> 33:06.401
You took all these pictures? Yeah.

33:06.472 --> 33:08.269
Oh, here she is
drinking coffee.

33:08.340 --> 33:10.399
Aw... Yeah, it's a Kona blend.

33:10.709 --> 33:12.108
Sometimes she has
the Colombian.

33:12.177 --> 33:14.145
Monk, there's got to be
more than 600 pictures here.

33:14.213 --> 33:15.737
Well, the rest are
still being developed.

33:15.814 --> 33:17.042
But you've only known her
for three days.

33:17.116 --> 33:18.913
I feel like
I've known her forever.

33:19.051 --> 33:21.042
She feels the same way.
She actually said that.

33:21.120 --> 33:24.112
Oh, yeah, these are
her adoptive parents.

33:24.189 --> 33:27.022
Yeah, that's Andy and Beth.
They're great.

33:27.092 --> 33:30.323
He's a little overweight.
He's a retired ophthalmologist.

33:30.562 --> 33:33.224
Oh, yeah. This is her
new boyfriend, Kyle.

33:33.298 --> 33:34.765
He's two years younger
than she is.

33:34.833 --> 33:36.801
She doesn't know how
she feels about that.

33:36.869 --> 33:38.097
Oh, yeah, and this is...

33:38.170 --> 33:40.638
And this is her telling me
not to take so many pictures.

33:40.706 --> 33:43.072
Mmm-hmm. This is her trying
to take the camera away.

33:43.142 --> 33:44.473
Uh-huh.
Oh, and guess what else.

33:44.543 --> 33:46.704
You know the Internet?
She's on it.

33:47.780 --> 33:48.769
Really?
She made the cut, huh?

33:48.847 --> 33:50.075
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:50.149 --> 33:52.913
Yeah, she has her own
website. It's called a blog.

33:53.052 --> 33:56.215
Really, I mean, that's
what it's called, a blog.

33:56.355 --> 33:58.255
Yeah, you can look up
all her old movie reviews.

33:58.323 --> 34:02.225
Randy, you like movies.
So you just type in

34:02.394 --> 34:04.828
"Molly Evans reviews,"
and then a dot,

34:04.897 --> 34:06.330
then "com," C-O-M.

34:06.398 --> 34:07.831
Yeah, I'll check it out.
Let me write it down.

34:08.400 --> 34:09.799
What is this?

34:11.770 --> 34:13.032
"Leland. "

34:13.839 --> 34:15.737
Did you write me a letter?

34:18.376 --> 34:19.603
"Dear Leland... "

34:19.677 --> 34:22.237
I've been, uh, holding
on to it all week.

34:23.815 --> 34:26.147
I've just been waiting
for the right time to...

34:26.617 --> 34:28.312
I guess this is
the right time.

34:30.788 --> 34:32.187
Randy, when...

34:34.425 --> 34:35.551
When did this happen?

34:35.760 --> 34:37.318
I've been talking to them
for a few months.

34:37.395 --> 34:38.554
What's going on?

34:38.629 --> 34:40.654
Randy's leaving us.
He's taking another job.

34:40.732 --> 34:41.721
What?

34:43.467 --> 34:44.992
Yeah.

34:45.469 --> 34:48.199
You're looking at the new Police
Chief of Summit, New Jersey.

34:48.306 --> 34:50.170
What?
Police Chief?

34:50.241 --> 34:52.038
Whoa, congratulations.

34:52.110 --> 34:54.135
Congratulations.
Thank you.

34:54.212 --> 34:56.179
Nicely done, Chief.

34:56.914 --> 34:57.903
Thank you.

34:58.316 --> 35:02.218
So what do you think?
You think I'm ready?

35:02.954 --> 35:06.355
I don't think anything. I know that
you're ready. You're gonna be great.

35:06.924 --> 35:09.154
Well, I had
a great teacher.

35:09.360 --> 35:10.384
I'm talking about you.

35:10.461 --> 35:13.294
I know what you meant,
Randy. Thank you, Randy.

35:13.664 --> 35:15.894
Um, why New Jersey?

35:16.434 --> 35:19.528
Oh, I think I know
the answer to that.

35:21.506 --> 35:22.871
Sharona.
Sharona?

35:22.940 --> 35:24.237
You and Sharona.

35:24.308 --> 35:26.037
We got a place.
We're moving in.

35:27.211 --> 35:29.270
That's perfect.
That is perfect.

35:29.347 --> 35:32.282
You and Sharona.
I knew it.

35:33.084 --> 35:34.142
Well, I didn't
actually know it,

35:34.218 --> 35:35.617
but now that I know it,
I kind of knew it.

35:35.686 --> 35:36.846
Yeah.

35:38.456 --> 35:40.253
Well, thank you, guys.
Thank you.

35:41.492 --> 35:43.323
Okay. Yeah.
Hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

35:43.728 --> 35:45.093
Oh, that was a good one.

35:45.163 --> 35:47.722
Adrian, this is embarrassing.
I'm not a movie star.

35:47.798 --> 35:50.460
You are to me.
That was good, too.

35:50.534 --> 35:52.195
What do you do with all
these pictures anyway?

35:52.269 --> 35:54.134
I'm making scrapbooks.

35:54.204 --> 35:56.399
I've already filled four of
them. You want to see them?

35:56.473 --> 35:57.872
Maybe when I get back.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.402
Back from where?

35:59.776 --> 36:02.074
I have to go to Toronto,
the film festival.

36:02.145 --> 36:05.171
Oh, yeah.
What film festival?

36:05.749 --> 36:07.740
The Toronto
Film Festival.

36:07.884 --> 36:09.112
Oh, yeah, right.

36:09.186 --> 36:10.551
I go every year.

36:11.121 --> 36:12.145
I won't be gone long.

36:12.222 --> 36:13.621
Oh, thank God.

36:13.690 --> 36:14.918
Just two weeks.

36:14.991 --> 36:18.358
Whoa, whoa, okay, wait.
Wait, yeah, two... Two weeks.

36:20.130 --> 36:21.358
Okay.

36:21.765 --> 36:23.232
Okay, I'll come with you.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.767
I can do Canada.

36:24.835 --> 36:26.700
I went there once
with your mother.

36:27.304 --> 36:28.862
What about your job?

36:29.472 --> 36:31.497
I don't have a job.
I'm retired.

36:31.575 --> 36:33.042
Since when?

36:33.210 --> 36:34.541
Since you.

36:35.245 --> 36:37.338
Since you and me.
Since us.

36:37.948 --> 36:40.610
Well, I thought
you were broke.

36:40.951 --> 36:42.578
No, I'll be fine.

36:42.752 --> 36:44.686
I can live for 20 years
if I don't eat

36:44.754 --> 36:47.985
or pay rent
or pay Natalie.

36:48.491 --> 36:49.753
Right?

36:50.227 --> 36:53.719
Adrian, you can't quit.
What would you do all day?

36:54.030 --> 36:55.224
I don't know.
This.

36:55.632 --> 36:57.190
Hang around with you.

36:57.267 --> 36:58.859
I just wanna
watch you grow up.

36:58.935 --> 37:01.267
I'm 26 years old.
I'm not a kid.

37:01.338 --> 37:03.135
I just want you
in my life, you know?

37:03.206 --> 37:04.366
I need you in my life.

37:04.441 --> 37:07.137
I am in your life.
I'm not going anywhere.

37:08.879 --> 37:11.006
I'm worried about
your life.

37:11.882 --> 37:13.406
You can't quit.

37:14.150 --> 37:15.412
Not for me.

37:15.518 --> 37:17.383
There are lots of
other Trudys out there,

37:17.454 --> 37:20.149
and I think you're
obligated to help them.

37:20.322 --> 37:21.346
You have a gift.

37:21.423 --> 37:22.754
And a curse.

37:22.892 --> 37:26.020
It's not a curse, it's a
gift. Can't you see that?

37:27.129 --> 37:30.621
Maybe that's why I'm here.
To remind you.

37:33.168 --> 37:36.001
What? That's exactly what
your mother used to say.

37:37.106 --> 37:38.368
Really?

37:41.543 --> 37:43.238
What was she like?

37:43.779 --> 37:46.373
Well, she snored.

37:46.448 --> 37:47.676
She did?

37:47.750 --> 37:51.151
Yeah.
She never believed me.

37:51.387 --> 37:53.252
One night I taped her
with a tape recorder.

37:53.322 --> 37:54.880
She still didn't believe it.

37:54.957 --> 37:56.925
She loved Willie Nelson.

37:57.626 --> 38:00.959
When she was thinking, she'd
stick out her tongue like this.

38:01.463 --> 38:02.691
Oh, my God,
I do that all the time.

38:02.765 --> 38:05.290
I know. I love it when you do that.

38:35.011 --> 38:36.273
What are you doing?

38:36.345 --> 38:39.041
Cutting out a recipe. I'm
making dinner for Steven.

38:39.115 --> 38:40.548
You wanna come?
You should come.

38:40.616 --> 38:42.345
Uh, no, thank you.

38:42.418 --> 38:44.215
I didn't poison you.
It was on the wipes.

38:44.287 --> 38:47.154
I know. I can't go anyway. I have plans.

38:47.423 --> 38:48.856
Mmm-hmm.
What kind of plans?

38:48.925 --> 38:51.392
With Molly. We're going to the movies.

38:53.628 --> 38:54.959
You're going
to the movies?

38:55.063 --> 38:56.325
Yeah.

38:59.167 --> 39:01.158
Adrian Monk is
going to the movies?

39:01.303 --> 39:02.895
Why are you crying?
Is that so strange?

39:02.971 --> 39:04.905
That's not strange at all.

39:05.073 --> 39:06.973
That's why I'm crying.

39:07.109 --> 39:08.633
What are you
gonna see?

39:08.710 --> 39:10.701
I don't know.
Whatever's in theater 10.

39:10.779 --> 39:12.576
Okay, all right.
That's more like it.

39:12.647 --> 39:14.410
That's the Adrian Monk
we know and love.

39:14.516 --> 39:17.041
Hello.
Yeah, he's right here.

39:19.354 --> 39:21.549
Oh, okay, I understand.
We're on our way.

39:22.290 --> 39:25.384
We have to go. They found another
body on West Vinton Street.

39:25.460 --> 39:26.586
The Captain's gonna
meet us there.

39:26.661 --> 39:28.151
Hey, wait.

39:28.396 --> 39:29.385
What are you doing?

39:29.464 --> 39:31.762
Checking the stove
to make sure it's off.

39:31.967 --> 39:33.161
That's a good idea.
You don't wanna get

39:33.235 --> 39:35.169
all the way downtown
and not be sure.

39:35.237 --> 39:36.602
That actually happened
to me once.

39:36.671 --> 39:38.104
Really?
Yeah.

40:27.121 --> 40:29.589
Pothole. Oh, sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

40:30.024 --> 40:31.252
That's not...
Harold!

40:54.448 --> 40:55.642
Wipe?
