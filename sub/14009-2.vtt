00:02.852 --> 00:04.153
Previously, on Damages...

00:04.268 --> 00:05.658
HEWES: Meet my granddaughter.

00:05.757 --> 00:08.679
Michael had a chance to be a
father, and he ran away from it.

00:08.764 --> 00:10.818
GREY: It's been three years.
Track Michael down.

00:10.924 --> 00:13.438
HEWES: I'm looking to hire
a private investigator.

00:13.534 --> 00:15.782
HUNTLEY: - And who's this?
HEWES: - My son.

00:15.917 --> 00:19.925
ERICKSON: I am the founder and CEO of
the High Star Security Corporation.

00:20.034 --> 00:21.371
EVERETT: What is it with
you and High Star?

00:21.468 --> 00:23.725
PARSONS: They're a private
army killing for a profit,

00:23.827 --> 00:25.105
making money off of death.

00:25.190 --> 00:26.737
HEWES: Stay away from High Star.

00:26.828 --> 00:30.433
Dozens of lawyers have tried to build a
case against them, and it's never worked.

00:30.512 --> 00:32.458
PARSONS: I have a friend.
He may know some things.

00:32.543 --> 00:35.173
Did something happen to you over there
while you were working for Erickson?

00:35.260 --> 00:39.483
SANCHEZ: I led a unit...
for a mission we should've never been on.

00:39.602 --> 00:41.468
ERICKSON: You don't go
near Sanchez, understood?

00:41.539 --> 00:43.659
BOORMAN: If anyone finds out
about that last mission...

00:43.736 --> 00:45.177
ERICKSON: That's why I sent
him to a psychiatrist.

00:45.252 --> 00:47.295
BOORMAN: Shrink's job to get the
truth out the boy

00:47.378 --> 00:49.916
and the truth just isn't our friend.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.313
(loud explosion)

00:53.337 --> 00:57.047
PARSONS: Something happened on that last
mission, and High Star is covering it up.

00:57.137 --> 00:59.957
The men who died, you knew them.
These were your men.

01:00.050 --> 01:02.448
High Star's over there, they're
breaking the law for profit, and

01:02.509 --> 01:05.399
- they're accountable to no one.
SANCHEZ: - What would you need me to do?

01:56.467 --> 01:57.978
I assume that's important.

HEWES: I'm, uh, trying a case
against the world's largest

pharmaceutical company. I mean...
it could mean hundreds

02:07.943 --> 02:11.779

(laughs)

02:11.902 --> 02:13.045

Tell me about you.
Was being a therapist always

02:58.389 --> 03:01.779
your dream, or was medical school just...
too tough?

03:02.335 --> 03:06.882
BALDWIN: We've had this discussion.
The therapy is not about me.

03:07.692 --> 03:09.017
We need to discuss how you ended

03:09.109 --> 03:12.799
up here, and then I have to
sign off on your progress.

03:15.148 --> 03:20.103

BALDWIN: On your personal form,
you wrote that you have a son.

03:36.948 --> 03:38.527
Maybe we should talk about him.

03:40.027 --> 03:41.355
HEWES: He's my only child.

03:41.516 --> 03:43.562
He ran away three years ago and

03:43.656 --> 03:46.548
left me with his baby

But next time we have to, uh,

04:46.656 --> 04:49.458

05:47.663 --> 05:49.238
killed while working for High Star.

05:49.678 --> 05:52.809
High Star conducted an illegal
mission at the order of company.

05:52.901 --> 05:55.852
CEO Howard Erickson.
During the execution of this

05:55.944 --> 05:58.400
mission, these men lost their lives.

05:58.515 --> 06:00.408
And you're proposing that
we file a wrongful death

06:00.495 --> 06:02.063
suit against High Star?

06:02.174 --> 06:03.045
PARSONS: Yes, sir.

06:03.146 --> 06:06.605
This is Jessica Lowry,
Thomas Lowry's widow.

06:06.697 --> 06:09.183
She represents the men's
families, all of whom are

06:09.267 --> 06:10.835
willing to be plaintiffs in the suit.

06:10.955 --> 06:12.180
Who's this fourth man?

06:12.265 --> 06:14.062
PARSONS: Chris Sanchez.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.540
He was in charge of the unit.

06:15.628 --> 06:18.623
Mr. Sanchez has since resigned
from High Star, and he's willing

06:18.704 --> 06:21.751
to give eyewitness testimony
against the company.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.457
What does he say
happened on the mission?

06:23.574 --> 06:26.086
PARSONS: Understandably, Mr.
Sanchez is concerned about the

06:26.219 --> 06:29.427
potential consequences of
testifying, so before he gives

06:29.517 --> 06:32.678
any details he wants to be certain
that the firm will support the case.

06:32.827 --> 06:35.495
How many other cases have been
brought against High Star?

06:35.607 --> 06:38.648
EVERETT: Almost 60, and
they've all been dismissed.

06:38.787 --> 06:41.724
PARSONS: But...
none of them have had my witness.

06:41.822 --> 06:43.437
This is a very
compelling case, Ellen.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.836
Are you sure Mr.
Sanchez will cooperate?

06:45.926 --> 06:48.715
PARSONS: Yes.
He's assured me he will.

06:49.781 --> 06:51.453
(TV news playing indistinctly)

06:53.719 --> 06:54.551

calling to see how you're doing.

07:09.548 --> 07:10.763
I pitched the case
to the partners.

07:10.866 --> 07:14.067
We should get an answer back soon.
Call me back, okay?

07:15.299 --> 07:16.237
CONWAY: Who's Ellen?

07:17.674 --> 07:20.999
SANCHEZ: No one.
Friend from high school.

Fire was caused by a gas explosion, which

Upper West Side psychiatrist, Dr.
Raul Barrera.

07:27.869 --> 07:30.556

pronounced dead at the scene.

07:31.713 --> 07:35.091
Three firefighters also suffered
minor injuries battling the blaze.

An investigation into the cause
of the explosion continues.

Side, Tara Lynn Wagner, New York 1.

Where are you going?

07:50.973 --> 07:51.837

07:54.266 --> 07:55.701
SANCHEZ: It was the
same doctor I went to.

07:56.188 --> 07:57.427
PARSONS: You think
someone is targeting you?

07:57.523 --> 07:58.301
SANCHEZ: I don't know, but I

07:58.385 --> 07:59.982
had an appointment
scheduled this morning.

08:00.109 --> 08:01.121
KEVIN: You need
anything, Ellen?

08:01.214 --> 08:02.322
I can put on a pot of coffee.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.777
PARSONS: I'm fine.
Thank you, Kevin.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.354
Who referred you to this doctor?

08:06.450 --> 08:07.661
SANCHEZ: A friend... A.C.

08:07.765 --> 08:09.364
PARSONS: Does he
work for High Star?

08:09.454 --> 08:10.834
SANCHEZ: Yeah.

08:12.495 --> 08:13.589
But you don't understand.

08:13.686 --> 08:16.935
A.C. trained me, he saved my
life, like, a half a dozen

08:17.015 --> 08:18.670
times... The guy's
like a brother to me.

08:18.777 --> 08:19.981
PARSONS: Does he know that

08:20.062 --> 08:21.673
- you've been talking to a lawyer?
SANCHEZ: - No.

08:21.757 --> 08:24.559
PARSONS: Does anyone at High Star
know that we've been in contact?

08:24.651 --> 08:25.830
SANCHEZ: No, I've told no one.

08:25.926 --> 08:26.725
(loud clank)

08:27.955 --> 08:29.245
(engine starts)

08:30.473 --> 08:33.277
PARSON: Chris. It's okay.

08:37.303 --> 08:40.376
I need you to keep to
yourself for a little while.

08:41.369 --> 08:42.998
Can you do that?

08:45.328 --> 08:48.011
I don't want you talking to
anyone from the company.

08:48.623 --> 08:50.282
SANCHEZ (sighs):
Whatever you say.

08:50.662 --> 08:52.576
PARSONS: I'm also gonna hire
private security for you.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.613
SANCHEZ: I don't need that.

08:53.716 --> 08:55.026
PARSONS: Just to make sure...

08:55.118 --> 08:57.402
SANCHEZ: What, so I could have more
guys with guns hanging around me?

08:57.482 --> 08:58.792
I can take care of myself, okay?

08:58.869 --> 09:00.380
I can take care of
my fuckin' self.

09:00.744 --> 09:03.661
PARSONS: Just... calm down.

09:06.663 --> 09:09.612
I don't want anyone to know that
you've been talking to a lawyer.

09:10.142 --> 09:12.534
So we shouldn't be in contact
until I have official word from

09:12.620 --> 09:15.743
my firm and we're
ready to file a case.

09:16.743 --> 09:18.468
SANCHEZ (quietly): Fine.

09:18.647 --> 09:20.425
PARSONS: Once I have the
resources, we'll figure out this

09:20.503 --> 09:23.864
explosion and exactly
what is going on.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.853
Chris? Are you still
willing to testify?

09:36.733 --> 09:38.544
SANCHEZ: If it will
help my guys' families.

09:40.032 --> 09:41.505
PARSONS: That's what
this is all about.

09:45.361 --> 09:47.842
SANCHEZ: Come on, Ghwarri.
Come on, girl.

09:48.860 --> 09:49.555
PARSONS: That's great.

09:49.682 --> 09:50.667
Thank you. Thank you, Sean.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.965
Okay, well...
I'll see you back at the office.

Okay, bye.

10:03.393 --> 10:07.192
HEWES: Sorry I'm late.
I had therapy.

10:08.345 --> 10:09.312
PARSONS: Therapy?

10:09.402 --> 10:10.615
HEWES: Could I have a
cup of tea, please?

10:11.262 --> 10:12.011
Thank you.

10:12.883 --> 10:13.832
(sighs): Ah...

10:14.227 --> 10:15.669
PARSONS: I thought you
didn't believe in therapy.

10:15.749 --> 10:16.954
HEWES: Yeah, well,
this is court-ordered.

10:17.038 --> 10:18.567
(chuckles)

10:20.945 --> 10:22.454
It's all Perry's fault.

10:22.949 --> 10:24.230
PARSONS: Your doorman?

10:27.300 --> 10:28.811
HEWES: I was late
for a meeting.

10:28.909 --> 10:31.968
I was in the lobby waiting for
him to open the door for me, and

10:32.068 --> 10:36.026
he just stood there, rambling
on about the goddamn weather.

10:36.191 --> 10:39.451
I pushed past him... (laughs)

10:39.706 --> 10:41.780
and the door hit
him in the face.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.505
I accidentally broke his nose.

10:45.642 --> 10:47.159
PARSONS: Accidentally.

10:47.276 --> 10:48.597
HEWES: The prick
pressed charges.

10:48.683 --> 10:51.804
The judge let me off
provided I go to therapy.

10:54.421 --> 10:59.137
(sighs) Anyway, listen...
I need a new nanny.

10:59.285 --> 11:00.262
PARSONS: Still?

11:00.405 --> 11:01.856
Where's Catherine?

11:02.012 --> 11:04.039
HEWES: In the office
with my assistant.

11:05.604 --> 11:06.872
Do you know of anyone?

11:08.436 --> 11:11.255
I mean, y-you must have
friends who have kids.

11:11.443 --> 11:12.918
PARSONS: In Jersey, sure.

11:13.018 --> 11:15.125
But none of them can
afford nannies.

11:15.278 --> 11:16.406
HEWES: Oh, God.

11:17.356 --> 11:18.652
PARSONS: I'll be in your
shoes tomorrow night...

11:18.747 --> 11:21.479
Baby-sitting my niece when my
sister goes Christmas shopping.

11:24.156 --> 11:26.573
HEWES: Well...
do you want to get them together?

11:28.225 --> 11:30.156
PARSONS: Like a playdate?

11:30.259 --> 11:33.227
HEWES: I mean, it would, you
know, give me a break and...

11:33.355 --> 11:35.628
burn off some of
Catherine's energy.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.949
PARSONS: Yeah, could be good.

11:41.047 --> 11:42.628
Maybe.

11:44.076 --> 11:44.967
HEWES: Oh, thank you.

11:47.731 --> 11:50.547
PARSONS: So, I pitched the High
Star case to the firm yesterday.

11:54.856 --> 11:56.543
HEWES: You didn't
take my advice.

12:00.350 --> 12:02.334
Have you convinced your
friend to be a witness?

12:02.799 --> 12:06.978
PARSONS: Yeah. Although it may
have made him into a target.

12:08.134 --> 12:10.681
HEWES: Do the people at High Star
know that he's talking to you?

12:10.977 --> 12:15.612
PARSONS: He says no, but the explosion
uptown may have been meant for him.

12:21.646 --> 12:24.790
HEWES: Your firm is never gonna
let you try this case, Ellen.

12:25.843 --> 12:27.242
PARSONS: Why do you say that?

12:27.936 --> 12:31.294
HEWES: Because ever since Hollis Nye
retired, they have no backbone.

12:32.196 --> 12:34.613
Defendants like this terrify them.

12:35.695 --> 12:38.673
You'll see.
They'll fold.

12:41.807 --> 12:43.761
PARSONS: Well, they
already said yes.

12:46.864 --> 12:47.912
HEWES: Really?

12:48.352 --> 12:49.749
PARSONS: Got the
call before you came.

12:51.794 --> 12:55.139
HEWES: Well... good for you.

12:55.845 --> 12:57.109
I stand corrected.

12:58.727 --> 13:00.984
(chuckles) And here I was
talking about nannies.

13:02.076 --> 13:04.188
PARSONS: I'm taking my witness's
statement in the morning.

13:04.803 --> 13:06.936
HEWES: This is going to be
a big step for you, Ellen.

13:08.097 --> 13:09.387
Congratulations.

13:10.262 --> 13:11.297
PARSONS: Thanks.

13:11.814 --> 13:14.083
I... I should run. I'm sorry.

13:15.153 --> 13:16.972
HEWES: I'll take care of this.
Don't worry.

13:18.459 --> 13:20.528
So you'll think
about the playdate?

13:20.999 --> 13:22.173
PARSONS: I will.

13:22.904 --> 13:23.925
Thanks for the coffee.

13:32.950 --> 13:34.898
ERICKSON: What the fuck
were you thinking?!

13:35.088 --> 13:37.925
I've sent dozens of my men to that shrink.
I trusted him!

13:38.069 --> 13:41.276
BOORMAN: I told you not to
send Sanchez to a psychiatrist.

13:41.372 --> 13:42.838
ERICKSON: So you
blast his office!

13:42.928 --> 13:46.430
BOORMAN: First of all, I didn't
do anything to that poor doctor.

13:46.527 --> 13:49.025
I saw it on the news,
just like everybody else.

13:49.155 --> 13:50.201
(chewing, crunching)

13:50.294 --> 13:51.045
Damn shame.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.184
Con Ed had the place
all wired wrong.

13:53.274 --> 13:55.095
ERICKSON: You wipe that
fuckin' smirk off your face.

13:55.196 --> 13:57.990
BOORMAN: I followed
your wishes 100%.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.193
You told me to stay away
from Sanchez, and I did.

14:05.156 --> 14:07.218
ERICKSON: This stops right
here, right now, you hear me?

14:07.314 --> 14:10.009
Nobody else gets hurt,
do you understand?

14:10.321 --> 14:12.607
BOORMAN: I couldn't agree with
you more, but that lawyer,

14:12.703 --> 14:18.606
Ellen Parsons, we need to find a way
to keep Sanchez away from her.

14:20.467 --> 14:21.740
ERICKSON: What are
you suggesting?

14:22.034 --> 14:24.477
BOORMAN: Well, we could
pay him, I suppose.

14:24.579 --> 14:26.551
ERICKSON: He's already
turned down a promotion.

14:26.668 --> 14:27.955
BOORMAN: Or threaten him.

14:28.153 --> 14:29.988
ERICKSON: He's one
of my top employees.

14:30.173 --> 14:33.687
BOORMAN: Look...
as long as he's in this country, there's no

14:33.770 --> 14:36.883
guarantees of us
being protected.

14:38.033 --> 14:42.845
Now, the best move you could
make is to redeploy him.

14:44.374 --> 14:45.904
ERICKSON: The kid's
damaged goods.

14:45.997 --> 14:47.622
I can't send him
back to a war zone.

14:49.286 --> 14:50.451
BOORMAN: I'm all ears.

14:50.542 --> 14:51.593
You got a better idea?

14:54.998 --> 14:56.956
(Tv playing)

15:07.513 --> 15:08.688
(knocking on door)

15:17.236 --> 15:18.143
SANCHEZ: Yeah?

15:19.213 --> 15:20.238
ERICKSON: Sanchez.

15:26.655 --> 15:27.778
(door creaking)

15:28.130 --> 15:29.065
SANCHEZ: Mr. Erickson.

15:29.799 --> 15:30.837
ERICKSON: Mind
if I step inside?

15:31.829 --> 15:33.167
SANCHEZ: No, sir. Come on in.

15:39.331 --> 15:42.348
I'm sorry, I-I'm just surprised
to see you here, sir.

15:42.487 --> 15:45.685
ERICKSON: I know.
I wanted to talk to you face-to-face.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.565
A.C. told me you've been
going through a tough time.

15:51.013 --> 15:52.137
SANCHEZ: Yes, sir.

15:53.355 --> 15:55.081
I guess I have.

15:56.012 --> 15:58.237
ERICKSON: And then there's
this explosion uptown.

16:03.619 --> 16:04.376
(sighs)

16:04.862 --> 16:06.411
SANCHEZ: Can I get you a
beer or something, sir?

16:06.486 --> 16:07.397
ERICKSON: Sure, why not?

16:08.237 --> 16:10.093
Beer wouldn't do me
wrong right about now.

16:15.966 --> 16:16.594
Thank you.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.245
I'm very concerned about
this whole thing.

16:24.899 --> 16:27.398
A.C. got Dr.
Barrera's name from me.

16:28.032 --> 16:29.756
The doctor was an
old friend of mine.

16:31.552 --> 16:33.060
SANCHEZ: News said
it was a gas leak.

16:34.796 --> 16:36.607
ERICKSON: I talked to several
guys I know at the city's

16:36.705 --> 16:39.896
antiterrorism task force.
They investigate these things.

16:41.521 --> 16:43.805
They're certain it
was a faulty valve.

16:51.457 --> 16:52.804
ERICKSON: Listen, son...

16:54.164 --> 16:55.422
(turns off TV)

16:55.624 --> 16:57.377
ERICKSON: I'm not sure
I believe it myself.

16:58.647 --> 17:01.755
I'm afraid someone's targeting
the company somehow.

17:03.214 --> 17:05.349
We got a lot of enemies.

17:05.594 --> 17:07.551
SANCHEZ: I thought someone
was maybe targeting me.

17:08.983 --> 17:10.076
ERICKSON: Who would do that?

17:11.017 --> 17:12.005
SANCHEZ: I don't know, sir.

17:16.806 --> 17:18.584
But that last mission...

17:19.428 --> 17:21.907
ERICKSON: Yeah. That was rough.

17:25.702 --> 17:26.788
Look, Chris...

17:29.912 --> 17:34.649
Sometimes we come home, our
trauma clouds our heads.

17:36.410 --> 17:38.500
We start seeing the
enemy everywhere.

17:39.536 --> 17:43.787
But I can tell you this... No one at
High Star questions your loyalty.

17:46.730 --> 17:49.651
SANCHEZ: Well, I know, sir.
I'm sorry if I implied...

17:49.782 --> 17:51.152
ERICKSON: We're
here to protect you.

17:57.343 --> 18:02.515
SANCHEZ: I heard the families of my men
got nothing from the company.

18:02.772 --> 18:04.334
ERICKSON: We're
not the military.

18:05.416 --> 18:07.729
Those men signed the
same contract as you.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.480
There's no provision
for death pay.

18:13.576 --> 18:19.086
Listen... I know you turned down
my offer a couple months back.

18:21.538 --> 18:23.819
A.C. told me your
mother's been sick.

18:25.632 --> 18:30.461
So if you're having money troubles, I'd be
happy to put that offer back on the table.

18:32.161 --> 18:33.813
SANCHEZ: You want
me to redeploy?

18:34.221 --> 18:37.966
ERICKSON: Only if it would help.
I can always use a man like you.

18:38.768 --> 18:40.371
SANCHEZ: I'd be no
good to you right now.

18:41.831 --> 18:46.074
I really need to see a...
A doctor.

18:46.769 --> 18:48.099
ERICKSON: I understand.

18:48.492 --> 18:51.172
And...
if you change your mind...

18:51.281 --> 18:52.578
SANCHEZ: I'm not
going back, sir.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.233
ERICKSON: All right.
I hear you loud and clear.

18:59.766 --> 19:00.783
Thanks for the beer.

19:04.823 --> 19:06.255
We're a family, Sanchez.

19:06.956 --> 19:09.369
We've got your back.
You hear me?

19:10.235 --> 19:11.443
SANCHEZ: Thank you, sir.

19:13.314 --> 19:14.745
(door unlocking, opening)

19:17.491 --> 19:18.354
(door closes)

19:18.614 --> 19:20.502
HEWES: You'll be a good
girl at the office today?

19:20.754 --> 19:21.323
CATHERINE: Mm-hmm.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.563
HEWES: Okay.

19:23.123 --> 19:23.728
(knocking)

19:25.854 --> 19:28.258
PERRY: These came for you.
I think they're baby supplies.

19:28.444 --> 19:30.359
HEWES: Thank you, Perry.

19:31.589 --> 19:33.164
Are you feeling
any better today?

19:33.257 --> 19:34.104
PERRY: I'm not.

19:34.469 --> 19:36.308
I think the weather
aggravates my injury.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.752
HEWES: Well, any day
you'll be back to normal.

19:42.245 --> 19:44.314
PERRY: Maybe. Maybe not.

19:50.995 --> 19:52.240
(sighs)

19:54.630 --> 19:55.912
HEWES: Call Jim Girotto.

19:56.010 --> 19:57.637
I want to move the
deposition again.

19:57.793 --> 19:58.600
MAGGIE: Got it.

19:58.706 --> 20:01.375
HEWES: And, uh, you'll
continue to take care of

20:01.470 --> 20:04.129
Catherine in the office
until I can find help.

20:04.634 --> 20:06.661
MAGGIE: You'll be bringing
her to work every day?

20:06.758 --> 20:07.805
HEWES: Yes.

20:07.914 --> 20:09.916
So make sure that she doesn't
catch her little hand in a

20:10.013 --> 20:13.159
stapler. Or something.
And call someone.

20:13.258 --> 20:15.296
I want the whole
office child-proofed.

20:15.407 --> 20:18.124
MAGGIE: Okay. Uh, Mr.
Huntley's waiting for you.

20:18.220 --> 20:19.084
HEWES: Send him in.

20:21.563 --> 20:23.782
HUNTLEY: I ran Michael's photo
and personal information

20:23.885 --> 20:28.072
through the system.
And no hospital or morgue had

20:28.196 --> 20:31.192
any John Does that
matched his description.

20:31.403 --> 20:32.189
HEWES: Of course not,

20:32.283 --> 20:34.015
Mr. Huntley, Michael isn't dead.

20:34.113 --> 20:36.448
He's running from his
responsibilities.

20:37.847 --> 20:39.628
HUNTLEY: Right.

20:40.153 --> 20:42.873
Oh, and also, um, he's not
part of the prison system.

20:43.062 --> 20:44.203
I-I checked that out.

20:44.769 --> 20:46.145
HEWES: How about money?

20:46.608 --> 20:47.311
HUNTLEY: Um...

20:47.907 --> 20:49.061
Well, he...

20:50.561 --> 20:51.691
I think two years ago...

20:55.863 --> 20:57.198
Two, yeah, two years ago, he,

20:57.303 --> 20:59.805
uh, withdrew $500
from an ATM uptown.

21:00.444 --> 21:05.422
Um... and that seems to be his
last financial transaction.

21:05.924 --> 21:07.261
HEWES: He's never
used his credit cards?

21:07.851 --> 21:11.527
HUNTLEY: Um, no, there's...
no record of that.

21:12.470 --> 21:16.604
Oh, and, um...
about your ex-husband.

21:16.722 --> 21:17.688
Is there any chance that.

21:17.809 --> 21:20.944
Mr. Grey may have been
helping your son out?

21:21.232 --> 21:22.364
HEWES: I've spoken to Phil.

21:22.473 --> 21:24.436
Michael hasn't contacted him.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.259
HUNTLEY: Well, he-he
never contacted, uh...

21:28.707 --> 21:29.984
Jill Burnham, either.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.369
I guess... I guess you forgot
to, um, to mention her.

21:37.469 --> 21:38.705
HEWES: There's no reason to.

21:39.579 --> 21:42.638
HUNTLEY: Right, she's just
the mother of his child.

21:43.163 --> 21:45.948
HEWES: Not legally.
I made sure of that.

21:50.722 --> 21:56.149
HUNTLEY: Right, so, um, you
said that, um, the last time you

21:56.264 --> 21:58.039
saw Michael was three years ago.

21:58.415 --> 22:00.495
Now that's right around the time
of your car accident, right?

22:01.272 --> 22:02.382
HEWES: Yes.

22:03.344 --> 22:06.824
HUNTLEY: It's interesting.
You know, the timing. It's just...

22:09.389 --> 22:10.104
HEWES: What's next,

22:10.191 --> 22:11.443
Mr. Huntley?

22:12.202 --> 22:12.976
(sighs)

22:13.455 --> 22:16.454
Oh, I, um, I'd like
to talk to his peers.

22:16.650 --> 22:21.623
Um, I'll need a list of his friends and
any people that he socialized with.

22:22.292 --> 22:23.837
HEWES: I'm only aware of a few.

22:24.803 --> 22:27.445
He was very secretive
about his private life.

22:28.135 --> 22:30.484
HUNTLEY: Well, we'll start
with the ones you know, and

22:31.560 --> 22:33.994
maybe that will lead us to some...
some secrets.

22:34.737 --> 22:37.596
HEWES: I'll get you a list.
Thank you.

22:38.710 --> 22:39.555
HUNTLEY: Thank you.

22:46.835 --> 22:47.636
EVERETT: Ellen.

22:47.766 --> 22:48.598
PARSONS: Hey, babe.

22:48.692 --> 22:49.636
EVERETT: Where you headed?

22:49.736 --> 22:51.703
PARSONS: Picking up Chris.
Bringing him in to take his statement.

22:52.309 --> 22:53.202
EVERETT: Ellen, wait.

22:54.572 --> 22:55.854
PARSONS: What's that
look on your face?

22:56.281 --> 22:58.934
EVERETT: Sorry, I...
I hate to tell you this.

23:00.103 --> 23:00.787
PARSONS: What?

23:01.760 --> 23:02.959
You said yes.

23:03.064 --> 23:05.743
I told my witness
we have a case.

23:06.831 --> 23:08.147
We reconsidered.

23:09.136 --> 23:10.639
PARSONS: Why are you
turning this down?

23:11.528 --> 23:15.738
The inordinate cost in a
case of this nature, both in

23:15.836 --> 23:21.582
terms of time and resources, is not
in the best interest of the firm.

23:22.482 --> 23:25.491
PARSONS: You're scared.
You're afraid of High Star.

23:25.580 --> 23:30.870
Ms. Parsons, I think you're
mistaking naiveté for courage.

23:31.056 --> 23:34.092
Nye, Everett has been around
for, what, over 100 years.

23:34.169 --> 23:36.109
Thousands of clients
and employees.

23:36.232 --> 23:39.669
We're not going to risk getting
sucked into some legal black

23:39.759 --> 23:44.349
hole that could put the very
existence of this firm in jeopardy.

23:44.509 --> 23:46.714
PARSONS: Hollis Nye would
have backed me on this.

23:46.818 --> 23:49.951
Mr. Nye isn't here anymore.

23:51.134 --> 23:54.855
Sometimes the better part of
valor is to cover your ass

23:55.985 --> 23:58.714
and survive to
fight another day.

23:59.204 --> 24:03.381
PARSONS: That's not valor, sir.
That's chickenshit.

24:14.447 --> 24:15.903
(cell phone rings)

24:17.068 --> 24:18.673
SANCHEZ: Ellen, hey.

24:18.789 --> 24:19.619
PARSONS: Hey, Chris.

24:19.705 --> 24:21.665
Listen, there's been
a change of plans.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.421
We're not going to be taking
your statement today.

24:23.542 --> 24:25.174
SANCHEZ: Why not?

24:25.291 --> 24:28.918
PARSONS: I just need a little more
time on my end to figure things out.

24:29.008 --> 24:30.084
Procedural stuff.

24:31.693 --> 24:32.759
SANCHEZ: Okay.

24:32.971 --> 24:33.754
Okay.

24:35.027 --> 24:36.741
PARSONS: How are you doing?

24:39.710 --> 24:40.808
SANCHEZ: I'm fine.

24:41.490 --> 24:43.720
PARSONS: Are you sure you don't want
me to look into security for you?

24:44.934 --> 24:46.150
SANCHEZ: Yeah, no, I'm good.

24:46.473 --> 24:48.785
Uh, so, we'll talk
soon, I guess.

24:49.286 --> 24:50.144
PARSONS: Yeah.

24:50.263 --> 24:51.301
Absolutely.

24:51.403 --> 24:52.512
Hang in there, okay?

24:53.444 --> 24:56.028
EVERETT: What are you doing?
You didn't tell him.

24:56.506 --> 24:58.164
PARSONS: I'm not giving up.

24:58.511 --> 24:59.765
EVERETT: There's no case.

24:59.905 --> 25:01.549
PARSONS: Maybe I'll
try it on my own.

25:01.688 --> 25:04.188
EVERETT: How?
You have no resources.

25:04.277 --> 25:05.937
PARSONS: Chris has put
himself out there for me.

25:06.094 --> 25:08.260
I-I can't just leave
him dangling.

25:08.402 --> 25:10.129
EVERETT: I'm not sure you have a choice.

25:10.248 --> 25:11.474
PARSONS: There's a way to
try this case,

25:11.558 --> 25:13.048
I just haven't figured it out yet.

25:13.185 --> 25:16.056
EVERETT: Ellen, if you
really want to do this...

25:17.348 --> 25:18.454
PARSONS: Yeah?

25:18.554 --> 25:20.845
EVERETT: I hate to mention it, but...
what about Patty?

25:20.961 --> 25:22.521
PARSONS: What about her?

25:22.624 --> 25:24.302
EVERETT: You haven't
thought about it?

25:24.402 --> 25:25.854
PARSONS: Taking
the case to her?

25:25.969 --> 25:26.986
EVERETT: It's an option.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.974
PARSONS: No. Not an option.

25:29.076 --> 25:30.871
I would never ask her for help.

25:30.970 --> 25:32.704
Maybe if she offered, but...

25:32.861 --> 25:36.071
I don't want to owe that
woman anything. Ever.

25:45.541 --> 25:46.278
SANCHEZ: Yo.

25:48.478 --> 25:49.499
SANCHEZ: Thanks for coming.

25:50.710 --> 25:53.418
I don't like to be too far
from my place these days.

25:54.099 --> 25:54.944
CARTER: What's going on?

25:55.101 --> 25:55.990
(Sanchez sighs)

25:56.166 --> 25:57.476
SANCHEZ: Your boss
came to see me.

25:57.950 --> 25:59.362
CARTER: Yeah, I know.

25:59.801 --> 26:01.871
SANCHEZ: So you spoke with him.

26:01.983 --> 26:04.465
CARTER: That shit with Dr.
Barrera hit him hard.

26:04.803 --> 26:07.291
He wanted to see you, so
I gave him your address.

26:07.412 --> 26:08.542
I hope that's okay.

26:08.636 --> 26:09.824
SANCHEZ: Yeah, sure.

26:13.031 --> 26:15.346
- Could I ask you something?
CARTER: - Of course.

26:15.582 --> 26:18.112
SANCHEZ: I know you're
tight with Erickson.

26:19.588 --> 26:21.118
Why is he so worried about me?

26:22.070 --> 26:23.245
CARTER: What do you mean?

26:23.833 --> 26:25.862
SANCHEZ: Is he afraid I'm going
to talk about the mission?

26:26.167 --> 26:28.820
CARTER: Fuck, no.
I told him you're solid.

26:29.593 --> 26:32.646
He's not afraid of you, Chris,
he's worried about your health.

26:37.736 --> 26:39.064
SANCHEZ: All right.

26:39.984 --> 26:41.633
Thanks, I just wanted
to hear it from you.

26:42.592 --> 26:43.419
CARTER: Hey.

26:43.693 --> 26:44.909
Want to grab a bite to eat?

26:45.127 --> 26:46.514
There's a good Chinese
joint up the block.

26:46.799 --> 26:49.500
SANCHEZ: Let's do it.
Let me just get Ghwarri.

26:50.188 --> 26:51.325
CARTER: Yeah, how is she?

26:51.697 --> 26:52.644
SANCHEZ: She's good.

26:52.735 --> 26:53.015
(gunshot)

26:53.173 --> 26:54.089
SANCHEZ: Fuck!

26:55.483 --> 26:56.464
(bystanders screaming)

26:57.988 --> 26:59.172
(gunshot)

27:03.680 --> 27:04.860
CARTER: Did you see
where it came from?

27:05.317 --> 27:06.926
SANCHEZ: Across the
street, fifth floor.

27:20.236 --> 27:21.175
SANCHEZ: Fuck!

27:28.001 --> 27:29.346
Fucking foreign cigarettes.

27:30.738 --> 27:31.822
CARTER: Check it out.

27:41.638 --> 27:42.989
Is someone clocking you, bro?

27:44.434 --> 27:45.945
Who the fuck would
be coming after you?

27:55.783 --> 27:57.018
SANCHEZ: Kalashnikov.

27:59.457 --> 28:00.603
PARSONS: I'm still
kind of in shock.

28:00.710 --> 28:03.286
I can't believe they
turned down the case.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.787
HEWES: Trust me, they
didn't even consider it.

28:06.078 --> 28:08.355
Firms don't practice law,
they calculate risk.

28:08.451 --> 28:09.707
I mean, you see it everywhere.

28:09.803 --> 28:12.987
No one has the stomach
for a case like that.

28:16.505 --> 28:18.736
Must have been difficult news
for your witness.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.871
PARSONS: I didn't tell him yet.

28:26.367 --> 28:28.453
I thought I might try
the case on my own.

28:29.519 --> 28:30.765
HEWES: You can't.

28:33.144 --> 28:34.155
PARSONS: I know, I know,

28:34.258 --> 28:35.587
I'm... fooling myself.

28:36.052 --> 28:40.185
I... I can't drag Chris through
the fire without any resources.

28:42.660 --> 28:45.449
HEWES: And what would you do if
you could find the resources?

28:46.367 --> 28:47.631
PARSONS: I'd try the case.

28:56.460 --> 28:59.327
HEWES: You're right.
It's not going to happen.

29:02.546 --> 29:05.562
Finding resources like that
is practically impossible.

29:07.111 --> 29:09.215
Looks like you've
hit a dead end.

29:13.221 --> 29:16.022
Catherine! Spit that out.
Right now.

29:16.198 --> 29:18.848
That's not for eating.
Good girl.

29:22.914 --> 29:25.020
(music playing, indistinct chattering)

29:27.240 --> 29:30.292
(people talking indistinctly)

30:32.091 --> 30:34.087
CARTER: Why would a haji be
targeting you in New Jersey?

30:34.273 --> 30:36.399
SANCHEZ: Maybe some kind of
blowback from the mission.

30:36.524 --> 30:37.702
CARTER: What do you mean?

30:37.809 --> 30:40.125
SANCHEZ: Fuck, man, we didn't
exactly make friends over there.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.864
We killed Afghanis. (Sighs)

30:43.615 --> 30:45.434
Maybe it's coming back
to bite me in the ass.

30:45.590 --> 30:48.588
CARTER: Chris, we
gotta stay calm.

30:50.647 --> 30:52.004
I want to talk with Erickson.

30:52.124 --> 30:54.463
Come with me back to the compound.
You'll be safe there.

30:54.580 --> 30:56.292
SANCHEZ: I-I can't.
I gotta, I gotta go home.

30:56.433 --> 30:57.623
CARTER: No, you can't.

30:57.718 --> 30:59.833
SANCHEZ: All my gear's there.
My-my-my dog.

30:59.927 --> 31:02.024
CARTER: Think about it.
You're being targeted.

31:02.156 --> 31:05.753
Some sniper with a fucking
Kalashnikov knows your routine.

31:05.893 --> 31:07.118
(Sanchez chuckles)

31:08.240 --> 31:09.492
SANCHEZ: You think
they're waiting for me?

31:09.626 --> 31:11.001
'Cause I'd love to meet 'em.

31:11.560 --> 31:12.728
CARTER: You're not
going anywhere.

31:12.826 --> 31:14.325
You're not in the right
frame of mind, Chris.

31:14.411 --> 31:15.958
SANCHEZ: I don't work
for High Star anymore!

31:16.047 --> 31:18.903
I don't have to take fucking
orders from you, A.C.!

31:29.239 --> 31:30.950
BOORMAN: As-salaam alaikum.

31:32.363 --> 31:33.449
FAZEL: Who are you?

31:35.348 --> 31:36.663
BOORMAN: You'll never know.

31:41.686 --> 31:43.488
BALDWIN: Why don't you
indulge me for a minute?

31:43.786 --> 31:45.937
HEWES: Is that why we're
here, to indulge you?

31:46.058 --> 31:48.066
BALDWIN: No, we're here so you
don't end up with a felony

31:48.181 --> 31:49.653
battery on your record.

31:51.792 --> 31:53.248
HEWES: Go on.

31:53.621 --> 31:56.395
BALDWIN: Why don't you try answering
a few questions honestly?

31:57.370 --> 31:58.260
Who knows?

31:58.865 --> 32:02.372
If you cooperate, maybe we
can cut the session short.

32:03.468 --> 32:04.685
HEWES: Ask your questions.

32:11.071 --> 32:12.439
BALDWIN: Who do you
call when you're sick?

32:12.934 --> 32:13.960
HEWES: I don't get sick.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.332
BALDWIN: But if you did, if you
wake up feeling, you know,

32:16.427 --> 32:20.516
violently ill, who
would you call?

32:23.429 --> 32:25.059
HEWES: 911.

32:27.294 --> 32:28.730
BALDWIN: Your husband's
remarried, you don't speak to

32:28.810 --> 32:30.872
your son, so in whom
do you confide?

32:35.239 --> 32:37.177
HEWES: My dog.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.124
BALDWIN: Look, we can sit
here and punch the clock for

32:42.264 --> 32:44.511
months, but it gets a little
boring, don't you think?

32:44.666 --> 32:46.182
HEWES: It's very boring.

32:46.645 --> 32:48.487
(Hewes clears throat)

32:56.158 --> 32:57.246
(Baldwin sighs)

33:01.157 --> 33:02.342
HEWES: It's funny.

33:04.011 --> 33:04.894
BALDWIN: Yeah?

33:10.070 --> 33:12.915
HEWES: There's a woman who
used to work for me.

33:14.414 --> 33:15.554
BALDWIN: That you confide in?

33:15.681 --> 33:17.562
HEWES: No, no, I'm not
talking about that.

33:19.482 --> 33:21.880
This woman wants to try a case

33:22.659 --> 33:25.734
right now, and she needs
my help to do it.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.250
She wants it very badly.

33:33.229 --> 33:34.255
I could help her.

33:34.395 --> 33:36.728
I could give her
everything she needs.

33:39.267 --> 33:40.711
But I don't want to.

33:41.788 --> 33:42.956
BALDWIN: Why not?

33:44.034 --> 33:45.285
HEWES: I'm not sure.

33:47.577 --> 33:50.444
The arrangement could
even benefit me.

33:52.617 --> 33:54.030
BALDWIN: But you deny her.

33:54.268 --> 33:55.642
HEWES: Because I've already
helped her enough.

33:55.744 --> 33:58.901
I've done way too
much for this girl.

34:00.987 --> 34:02.632
BALDWIN: Well, maybe you
see something in her.

34:03.332 --> 34:05.028
HEWES: At first she was
just a means to an end.

34:08.981 --> 34:12.362
Should have cut her off as soon
as she served her purpose.

34:13.136 --> 34:14.367
BALDWIN: But you didn't.

34:16.172 --> 34:17.717
HEWES: No.

34:18.844 --> 34:20.551
BALDWIN: And why do
you think that is?

34:21.493 --> 34:23.161
HEWES: Everything she has now

34:23.306 --> 34:26.885
is because of me and
she still wants more.

34:29.873 --> 34:31.775
BALDWIN: You didn't
answer my question.

34:33.501 --> 34:35.157
Why do you keep her around?

34:39.821 --> 34:41.152
BOORMAN: Let's try this.

34:41.455 --> 34:42.833
(Fazel gasping)

34:45.089 --> 34:47.532
Why do you want to
kill Chris Sanchez?

34:47.971 --> 34:49.130
FAZEL: I don't.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.545
Please.

34:53.321 --> 34:54.060
(Fazel gasping)

34:54.188 --> 34:55.716
No! (Gasping)

34:55.821 --> 34:57.532
BOORMAN: You want
revenge, don't you?

34:58.794 --> 35:00.166
That's why you want to kill him.

35:01.827 --> 35:03.449
FAZEL: Yes, yes, yes!

35:03.625 --> 35:06.279
I-I've come for revenge!

35:13.768 --> 35:14.951
(zipper rasps)

35:31.458 --> 35:32.667
(knocking)

35:47.918 --> 35:49.758
SANCHEZ: What the fuck
you doing here?!

35:49.936 --> 35:52.744
BOORMAN: Hey, Sanchez,
you gonna let me in?

35:52.855 --> 35:54.113
SANCHEZ: Answer the question!

35:56.018 --> 35:58.804
BOORMAN: I came to warn you.
You're in danger.

36:09.808 --> 36:11.170
SANCHEZ: How do you know that?

36:12.210 --> 36:14.780
BOORMAN: I need you to
take a ride with me.

36:15.540 --> 36:16.518
SANCHEZ: Why?

36:16.666 --> 36:18.317
BOORMAN: Look, Sanchez, if

36:18.434 --> 36:20.449
you don't trust me,
bring your toolbox.

36:36.934 --> 36:38.848
Come on. It's in the back.

36:47.941 --> 36:49.414
SANCHEZ: Does this have
to do with the mission?

36:49.518 --> 36:50.720
BOORMAN: I'm afraid so.

36:52.414 --> 36:54.189
SANCHEZ: Mr.
Erickson said the intelligence we got

36:54.275 --> 36:55.666
out of there paid off.

36:57.392 --> 36:58.192
Did it?

36:58.311 --> 36:59.499
BOORMAN: That's classified.

36:59.628 --> 37:01.755
SANCHEZ: My fuckin' men were killed.
I want to know.

37:02.567 --> 37:03.069
(Boorman sighs)

37:03.176 --> 37:04.747
BOORMAN: Yeah, it paid off.

37:04.851 --> 37:05.638
Come on.

37:23.145 --> 37:25.694
You can throw your guns
down wherever you want.

37:48.456 --> 37:49.637
SANCHEZ: You live here?

37:49.798 --> 37:52.992
BOORMAN: Ah, I do work
here from time to time.

37:53.494 --> 37:54.856
More like an office.

38:05.959 --> 38:07.794
SANCHEZ: Tell me what the
fuck we're doing here.

38:15.202 --> 38:16.229
BOORMAN: Come here.

38:17.926 --> 38:18.740
Come.

38:30.403 --> 38:36.873
What you're about to see...
You never saw it.

38:39.154 --> 38:40.208
You understand?

38:41.413 --> 38:42.848
SANCHEZ: I understand.

39:37.301 --> 39:38.554
SANCHEZ: Who is this?

39:38.738 --> 39:40.759
BOORMAN: His name
is Salam Fazel.

39:42.222 --> 39:43.974
He was sent here to kill you.

39:55.402 --> 39:56.474
SANCHEZ: This his?

39:56.693 --> 39:57.538
BOORMAN: Yeah.

39:58.443 --> 39:59.497
SANCHEZ: Who sent him here?

39:59.600 --> 40:00.648
BOORMAN: This man.

40:02.864 --> 40:04.206
Nur Taraki.

40:05.006 --> 40:06.052
He's a mullah.

40:06.388 --> 40:08.551
Taliban... Big deal with them.

40:08.910 --> 40:09.822
Unfortunately, on that last

40:09.904 --> 40:12.511
mission, you and your men
killed his brother.

40:13.019 --> 40:14.857
Now he's looking for payback.

40:17.141 --> 40:18.310
SANCHEZ: How do you
know all this?

40:18.401 --> 40:20.339
BOORMAN: I'm tracking the
fallout on that mission.

40:21.122 --> 40:23.845
They've got this mullah
on a watch list.

40:23.945 --> 40:27.502
And his communications led us
to this shitbag over here.

40:29.256 --> 40:31.209
SANCHEZ: This guy wants revenge
for the mullah's brother?

40:31.313 --> 40:32.206
BOORMAN: Ask him.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.600
SANCHEZ: You think I killed
this man's brother?

40:37.711 --> 40:39.179
You think I killed his brother?

40:40.117 --> 40:44.821
FAZEL (hesitantly): You kill Nur
Taraki's brother, now I kill you.

40:51.086 --> 40:54.759
SANCHEZ: Maybe I did kill
him, but guess what?

40:57.883 --> 41:02.687
You cocksuckers killed my men.
So fuck you.

41:03.957 --> 41:05.058
(Fazel yelling)

41:05.647 --> 41:06.757
BOORMAN: Relax.

41:08.656 --> 41:09.488
I'm only telling you this 'cause

41:09.591 --> 41:12.178
we don't know how many of these
scumbags are out there.

41:13.253 --> 41:16.144
This mullah has access
to cells in the States.

41:16.244 --> 41:18.149
We've got to assume they're
coming after you.

41:18.433 --> 41:19.769
SANCHEZ: I think
they already have.

41:20.146 --> 41:21.341
BOORMAN: What do you mean?

41:21.429 --> 41:22.902
SANCHEZ: That explosion uptown?

41:25.319 --> 41:27.099
I was supposed to be
in that building.

41:28.115 --> 41:30.102
Then this cocksucker
took a shot at me.

41:30.217 --> 41:31.057
Right?

41:32.485 --> 41:33.339
Right?

41:36.008 --> 41:37.162
We found this.

41:38.703 --> 41:40.648
BOORMAN: It's a Kalashnikov.

41:43.135 --> 41:45.446
Is there somewhere you
can go for protection?

41:51.187 --> 41:52.784
SANCHEZ: Mullah Nur Taraki.

41:53.789 --> 41:56.206
Supposedly we took out his
brother, now he's coming after me.

41:57.143 --> 41:58.670
ERICKSON: And Boorman
told you this?

41:59.723 --> 42:00.633
SANCHEZ: Yeah.

42:01.950 --> 42:03.693
CARTER: If this mullah knows
that you worked for High Star,

42:03.810 --> 42:05.427
then he could start targeting
the whole company.

42:05.518 --> 42:06.569
ERICKSON: Don't get
too excited now.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.324
Let's-let's be smart about this.

42:09.776 --> 42:12.217
The way I see it, you should

42:12.325 --> 42:14.727
stay here at the compound
till we sort this out.

42:15.518 --> 42:18.710
You're safe here.
No one can touch you.

42:19.754 --> 42:21.045
SANCHEZ: Or I could redeploy.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.168
ERICKSON: You told me yourself,
that's not an option.

42:23.248 --> 42:24.996
SANCHEZ: I want to go back over
there and waste this mullah

42:25.102 --> 42:26.901
motherfucker before
he gets to me.

42:27.104 --> 42:29.544
CARTER: If you want to do that,
Chris, I'm going with you.

42:29.650 --> 42:30.766
ERICKSON: Let me
think about this.

42:41.718 --> 42:44.178
(phone ringing)

42:45.812 --> 42:46.818
PARSONS: Chris?

42:46.957 --> 42:48.527
SANCHEZ: Hey, I need to see you.

42:49.398 --> 42:50.672
PARSONS: Did you
get my messages?

42:50.808 --> 42:53.162
SANCHEZ: Yeah, I'd rather
not talk on the phone.

42:53.289 --> 42:54.561
I need your help.

42:54.654 --> 42:55.889
Can you come to my place?

42:57.381 --> 42:59.236
PARSONS: I can be there
at 11:00, is that okay?

42:59.791 --> 43:00.889
SANCHEZ: I'll see you then.

43:01.099 --> 43:01.832
PARSONS: Great.

43:08.319 --> 43:10.014
Thanks for meeting
me so last minute.

43:10.498 --> 43:11.376
HEWES: Sure.

43:11.585 --> 43:12.478
What's going on?

43:14.093 --> 43:17.296
PARSONS: I wanted to let you
know that I've decided to try

43:17.396 --> 43:19.030
the High Star case on my own.

43:19.695 --> 43:20.816
I filed the case.

43:21.280 --> 43:22.847
HEWES: Ellen, you'll be crushed.

43:22.940 --> 43:24.067
PARSONS: Then I'll be crushed.

43:24.863 --> 43:26.138
I'm not going to back down.

43:26.253 --> 43:27.364
HEWES: It's a terrible idea.

43:28.900 --> 43:30.871
PARSONS: I have to try, Patty.

43:31.107 --> 43:31.728
HEWES: I think you should

43:31.811 --> 43:35.243
step back, regroup,
find another case.

43:35.606 --> 43:36.381
(loud banging)

43:36.504 --> 43:37.478
Ellen Parsons?

43:37.596 --> 43:39.911
Don't make us bring the
war to you, bitch.

43:42.531 --> 43:43.844
(loud bang)

43:51.586 --> 43:52.594
HEWES: You all right?

43:55.857 --> 43:57.360
PARSONS: Not really.

43:58.300 --> 44:01.100
This is what I'm going to be up
against if I go through with this.

44:02.064 --> 44:05.007
Howard Erickson has way
too much to lose.

44:05.965 --> 44:08.389
HEWES: That's why someone
has to take him down.

44:08.810 --> 44:11.964
PARSONS: You said yourself that
I can't try this case alone.

44:12.502 --> 44:16.898
HEWES: I know I did.
But I changed my mind.

44:19.077 --> 44:23.314
If you back down now, you'll
just be another attorney.

44:23.700 --> 44:25.063
PARSONS: Maybe that's all I am.

44:25.693 --> 44:27.512
HEWES: Well, then you're
at a turning point.

44:28.758 --> 44:30.059
Decide what you want.

44:31.220 --> 44:32.968
PARSONS: I thought I had
what it takes, but...

44:33.073 --> 44:34.493
HEWES: You're tougher
than you think.

44:35.148 --> 44:37.143
PARSONS: I'm not you, Patty.

44:37.446 --> 44:39.386
I don't think I can live
like this anymore.

44:42.171 --> 44:43.375
HEWES: Let me help you.

44:46.579 --> 44:47.902
PARSONS: Help how?

44:48.222 --> 44:51.233
HEWES: Use my firm,
my resources.

44:51.622 --> 44:53.388
PARSONS: I'm grateful,
Patty, but no.

44:53.589 --> 44:55.342
HEWES: The case will
be 100% yours.

44:55.454 --> 44:57.535
I have no interest
in interfering.

45:00.643 --> 45:03.245
But I'll support you
any way you want.

45:05.204 --> 45:06.348
PARSONS: I don't know.

45:12.692 --> 45:16.247
HEWES: Let me help you.
I owe it to you.

45:19.828 --> 45:22.173
PARSONS: My witness's name
is Chris Sanchez.

45:25.240 --> 45:26.825
I'll meet with him tomorrow.

45:34.245 --> 45:36.502
(rock music playing)

45:40.221 --> 45:42.312
KEVIN: Ellen, gang's all here.

45:42.961 --> 45:45.291
PARSONS: Oh, hey, guys.
You were fantastic.

45:45.736 --> 45:47.619
Tony, scary as hell.
I had no idea.

45:47.808 --> 45:50.248
TONY: Come on, I was a
varsity linebacker.

45:50.812 --> 45:51.661
PARSONS: Very true.

45:51.786 --> 45:53.141
TONY: - You get what you need?
PARSONS: - Yeah.

45:53.234 --> 45:54.267
KEVIN: Tequila shots.

45:54.377 --> 45:58.395
PARSONS: Drinks are on me.
Seriously, much appreciated.

45:58.991 --> 45:59.854
TONY: Anything for Chris.

45:59.948 --> 46:00.865
PARSONS: Cheers.

46:03.428 --> 46:06.153
I would love to stay and get
shit-faced with you guys, but

46:06.252 --> 46:10.594
I'm going to go see him.
Appreciate it. Thanks again.

46:11.066 --> 46:11.881
Of course.

46:14.743 --> 46:15.899
(Fazel gasps)

46:17.269 --> 46:21.045
FAZEL: I am not a terrorist.

46:21.633 --> 46:22.786
BOORMAN: I know.

46:27.235 --> 46:31.251
Look, here's, uh... $10,000.

46:32.030 --> 46:33.346
(Fazel gasps)

46:34.939 --> 46:36.675
Sorry for the trouble.

46:38.451 --> 46:41.860
FAZEL: Why did you
do this to me?

46:43.684 --> 46:46.194
I love this country.

46:46.832 --> 46:47.988
BOORMAN: Really?

46:48.966 --> 46:50.494
(chuckles softly)

46:50.643 --> 46:52.303
I'm not sure I do.

46:56.854 --> 46:58.104
PARSONS: Chris.

47:00.116 --> 47:01.698
Chris, it's Ellen.

47:01.827 --> 47:03.027
I have some good news...

47:06.490 --> 47:07.880
Hello?

47:11.835 --> 47:13.029
Hello?

47:14.530 --> 47:15.515
Chris?

47:18.823 --> 47:19.750
Hello?

47:21.901 --> 47:23.487
Hey. Hey, Ghwarri.

47:24.170 --> 47:24.994
Hello.

47:26.224 --> 47:27.282
Hello. Where's Chris?

47:27.909 --> 47:28.908
Where's Chris?

48:01.221 --> 48:02.919
SANCHEZ: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck is that?

48:03.408 --> 48:06.121
Possible IED on the right.
I'm going to check it out.

48:24.489 --> 48:26.283
(phone ringing)

48:28.331 --> 48:29.314
ERICKSON: Yeah.

48:29.424 --> 48:30.276
CARTER: We're here.

48:30.431 --> 48:33.937
So what do we do now, look for
some mullah that doesn't exist?

48:34.057 --> 48:36.154
ERICKSON: Let him chase
his tail for awhile.

48:36.396 --> 48:38.575
CARTER: Okay, but, sir, he
doesn't necessarily believe.

48:38.663 --> 48:39.630
Boorman's story.

48:39.727 --> 48:43.019
ERICKSON: As long as he's over
there, we're fine for now.

48:47.504 --> 48:48.870
CARTER: Copy that.

48:53.479 --> 48:54.346
We good?

48:54.472 --> 48:56.143
SANCHEZ: All good.

48:56.386 --> 48:57.326
Let's do it.

49:00.608 --> 49:02.575
ERICKSON: Hope that kid's
going to be okay over there.

49:02.688 --> 49:06.552
BOORMAN: You're going to hear
tomorrow, but a few congressmen

49:06.655 --> 49:08.299
have decided to
change their votes.

49:08.578 --> 49:09.869
Congratulations.

49:11.323 --> 49:15.131
Your contracts... Looks like
they'll be renewed after all.

49:17.458 --> 49:18.935
ERICKSON: I appreciate it, Jerry.

49:19.719 --> 49:22.959
BOORMAN: See how it all works
out when, uh, (laughs) when we

49:23.063 --> 49:25.398
do things my way?

49:26.150 --> 49:28.188
(laughing)
