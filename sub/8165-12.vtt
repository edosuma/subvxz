of Thad Weber,

00:13.827 --> 00:16.344
a fine son, brother,
and fiancé.

00:18.865 --> 00:20.065

to clear your conscience,

the best thing for Kelsey?

00:27.274 --> 00:28.195

Thad's brother Chad

00:51.331 --> 00:52.781

00:54.234 --> 00:55.474
- Oh, my God.
- Thad has a twin?

00:56.470 --> 00:57.791
- Oh, yeah.
He never mentioned it?

00:57.838 --> 00:58.919
- No.
- Yeah, not surprised.

00:59.406 --> 01:00.566
They didn't really get along.

01:00.607 --> 01:02.087

01:02.809 --> 01:03.730

01:03.844 --> 01:05.377
When you're a twin,
you work extra hard

01:06.913 --> 01:07.873

01:08.648 --> 01:10.288
But we shared a lot
of the same interests.

We... we rowed together
at Brown,

01:13.854 --> 01:15.887

beautiful girls.

01:17.924 --> 01:18.725
But whatever we did,

01:19.392 --> 01:20.825
Thad always had
to come out ahead.

01:22.262 --> 01:23.562
So it's no surprise that he...

01:24.865 --> 01:26.898
