Does he ask questions?
Yeah.

10:32.551 --> 10:33.827
We'll have to get roses.

10:33.896 --> 10:35.068
Instead of roses,
we should, like, give them

10:35.137 --> 10:36.862
a vodka seltzer
or something.
Okay.

Jenni is the most
responsible one of the squad,

that she comes
ring shopping with me.

Do you have like,

her personality.

I don't know, are we?

11:23.689 --> 11:25.103

like a surprise?

11:25.172 --> 11:26.517
No, we should tell him.Do you want me to leave?

11:26.586 --> 11:27.931
Can you write me a note?No, you're gonna
be part of it.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
No.
Oh.

11:29.068 --> 11:33.000
Us girls decided
that all the roomies

11:33.068 --> 11:34.896
should go get
a different girl for Pauly.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.793
I love that.

the stairs.You have to dress really nice
and walk down the stairs.

Of course I'm trying.

Yeah, that's how I feel.
But this may work.

are gonna have a hard time

11:58.068 --> 12:00.206
I've been looking for it

For the love of DJ Pauly D,
I love it.

12:02.758 --> 12:05.482
Pauly needs a nice girl,
a boss bitch.

12:05.551 --> 12:08.758
Someone that has a good job
and is an independent woman

12:08.827 --> 12:10.241
that doesn't have
to rely on him.

getting a bitch's number out doesn't look good for you.

30:00.482 --> 30:01.689
It wasn't one.
It was two.

30:01.758 --> 30:04.068
What kind of guido math is that?

30:04.137 --> 30:06.137
It's not personal.  Great, make it five.

30:06.206 --> 30:08.620
Everybody's talking about it,

30:08.689 --> 30:10.000
and now it's a big  deal

30:10.068 --> 30:12.000
that you could have avoided by not doing that.

30:12.068 --> 30:13.620
Okay. Sorry about it.

30:13.689 --> 30:15.517
More.No, I'm sorry I did that.

30:15.586 --> 30:16.689
Are you gonna call these girls?

30:16.758 --> 30:17.724
No.

30:19.862 --> 30:22.000
So, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

30:22.068 --> 30:23.620
Yeah.All right.

30:23.689 --> 30:25.931
Bye.Bye.

30:27.310 --> 30:28.862
Oh, my God.

30:28.931 --> 30:31.517
I'm getting, like,
charged for murder right now.

30:31.586 --> 30:34.896
Meanwhile, all I did was like,
give someone a paper cut.

30:34.965 --> 30:36.655
You know,
don't think about it.

30:36.724 --> 30:38.931
If it was one girl
that I was talking to,

30:39.000 --> 30:40.827
that I was dancing with,
that I brought home

30:40.896 --> 30:43.034
the whole night,
then I'd be Ronnie.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.620
First of all,
first of all,

30:45.689 --> 30:49.068
I brought home nine girls.
Just for the record.

30:58.896 --> 31:00.310
You guys finding me
a wife today?

31:00.379 --> 31:01.862
Yeah.

31:01.931 --> 31:03.827
You guys got a harder job
than you think, you know?

31:03.896 --> 31:06.172
It's easy to find a girl,
but trying to find a good one.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.655
That's true.

31:07.724 --> 31:08.931
So don't  this up, bro.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.517
You know I know
what you like, boo.

31:10.586 --> 31:12.241
Bye, boys.
Good luck.

31:12.310 --> 31:15.724
So, it's Operation:
Find Pauly D Some Love Today.

31:15.793 --> 31:16.965
Hey, baby.

31:17.034 --> 31:18.689
You whores, I didn't know
you were leaving.

31:18.758 --> 31:21.137
Us girls and the boys,
we figure divide and conquering

31:21.206 --> 31:23.689
would be the best bet
right now.

31:23.758 --> 31:28.000
♪ She took the train,
we on the level ♪

31:28.068 --> 31:31.000
♪ What you think,
she acting bad ♪

31:31.068 --> 31:32.620
One of us goes to Ocean Drive,

31:32.689 --> 31:35.413
one of us goes
to the artsy part of Miami.

31:35.482 --> 31:37.586
So we get some, like,
sexy beach girls

31:37.655 --> 31:40.310
and we get some
artsy, classy girls,

31:40.379 --> 31:43.206
so Pauly has a choice
of what he wants.

31:43.275 --> 31:45.551
I think he needs a normal
chick, like on our level.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.827
Not too prim and proper.

31:47.896 --> 31:49.413
Right.

31:49.482 --> 31:51.724
There is nothing prim
and proper about us.

31:51.793 --> 31:53.724
No, we're disgusting
human beings.

31:53.793 --> 31:57.172
♪♪

31:57.241 --> 31:58.241
Excuse me?

31:58.310 --> 32:01.689
Oh, that's all right.
Forget it.

32:01.758 --> 32:02.965
Thickness.

32:03.034 --> 32:05.344
I would love to find
DJ Pauly D a girl

32:05.413 --> 32:07.965
like my girl Lauren,
who holds it down.

32:08.034 --> 32:10.241
A good idea would be, like,
to hold like a big sign up.

32:10.310 --> 32:12.000
Yep.So we can see like,
who's interested.

32:12.068 --> 32:13.551
Yeah. Definitely.Or not.

32:13.620 --> 32:15.344
I'm gonna go check if there's
like a store or something,

32:15.413 --> 32:16.344
and then I'll be
right back.

32:16.413 --> 32:18.103
We either get creepy

32:18.172 --> 32:20.862
where it's like, we're just
walking up to random girls...

32:20.931 --> 32:22.241
A'ight...
Oh!

32:22.310 --> 32:24.310
...or we just act
like it's a car wash.

32:24.379 --> 32:27.827
Like, guido car wash.
Get your Pauly D here special.

32:27.896 --> 32:31.068
Do you want Pauly's D?
Get your Pauly's D here.

32:31.137 --> 32:32.620
Get your Pauly D!

32:32.689 --> 32:34.103
I see a lot of old people.

32:34.172 --> 32:35.482
I think I saw
my grandma over there.

32:35.551 --> 32:36.931
Definitely gonna
have better luck

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
finding girls at the beach.

32:38.068 --> 32:39.793
Get your Pauly D.

32:39.862 --> 32:41.724
Get your Pauly's D.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.379
Okay, a little slow
so far, fellas.

32:44.655 --> 32:46.931
Is anybody single?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.034
Not for us!

32:48.103 --> 32:49.206
Yeah, not for us!

32:49.275 --> 32:50.793
For a hot guido!

32:50.862 --> 32:54.413
Nicole, 18, preggers.
Got it.

32:54.482 --> 32:58.034
Spiky guido!
He's like a porcupine.

32:58.103 --> 32:59.310
What about you,
are you taken?

33:00.758 --> 33:02.931
Wanna like, give her out
for the night?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.310
Let's see some boobies!
Yes!

33:05.379 --> 33:06.827
Boobs!
Boobs!

33:06.896 --> 33:08.068
Bravo!

33:08.137 --> 33:11.172
This is why we don't find any.
Yep.

33:11.241 --> 33:12.551
How old are you guys?

33:13.655 --> 33:14.965
Okay.
Okay.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.275
When we were like,
let's go find

33:16.344 --> 33:18.137
Pauly a girl in Miami,
I was like, ,

33:18.206 --> 33:19.689
just walk right out the door
and just scoop up

33:19.758 --> 33:21.172
like, ten of them.

33:21.241 --> 33:24.620
So we got two 12 year olds
and a pregnant chick.

33:27.275 --> 33:29.758
We failed.
An epic, legendary fail.

33:29.827 --> 33:31.241
The pregnant chick was hot.

33:31.310 --> 33:32.965
Okay, you can tell Vin
hasn't gotten laid in a while.

33:34.551 --> 33:36.137
I am sure that the girls

33:36.206 --> 33:38.517
are having better luck
than the boys right now.

33:38.586 --> 33:41.275
Well, this was a bust.

33:41.344 --> 33:44.724
We got nobody. Not one.
I hope the boys had better luck.

33:44.793 --> 33:46.379
I don't think
we're gonna find anything

33:46.448 --> 33:49.793
for Pauly D right here.

33:55.965 --> 33:58.448
Mission unsuccessful.

33:58.517 --> 34:01.000
Yeah, that sucked.

34:01.068 --> 34:02.137
Yo.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.689
The squad must reconvene

34:03.758 --> 34:05.068
and think of a backup plan,

34:05.137 --> 34:08.137
because we have no chick
for DJ Pauly D.

34:08.206 --> 34:10.241
It was an epic fail.

34:10.310 --> 34:12.000
Even you guys?
Like, nothing, right?

34:12.068 --> 34:14.586
Epic fail, I got
two 12-year-olds,

34:14.655 --> 34:16.965
one pregnant chick, and a girl
who don't speak English.We got nothing.

34:17.034 --> 34:19.724
We got literally people
saying "no, thank you."
Yeah.

34:19.793 --> 34:21.655
I'm a little embarrassed
right now.

34:21.724 --> 34:22.862
I feel a little defeated.

34:22.931 --> 34:24.379
Like, we got nobody
for Pauly,

34:24.448 --> 34:26.034
and he's probably
gonna be so excited

34:26.103 --> 34:28.724
thinking that we did,
and that's so sad.

34:28.793 --> 34:30.448
Maybe we went about it
all the wrong way.

34:30.517 --> 34:32.482
Abort mission.
Abort mission.

34:32.551 --> 34:34.000
What's his favorite dessert?
Maybe we should make it.

34:34.068 --> 34:35.586
Chocolate cake?

34:35.655 --> 34:38.758
Should we make him a favorite
dessert and be like, sorry?

34:38.827 --> 34:39.862
That was a good idea.

34:39.931 --> 34:41.517
He loves sweets.

34:41.586 --> 34:44.827
We'll make him a cake,
we'll put an "I'm sorry" on it.

34:44.896 --> 34:48.172
And then, you know, at least
he could eat his sorrows.

34:48.241 --> 34:50.103
Does he like funfetti?
Yes.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.758
Should we make
a funfetti?

34:51.827 --> 34:53.241
Yeah.

34:56.551 --> 34:58.517
Damn!

34:58.586 --> 35:00.137
You're looking
like a whole snack.

35:00.206 --> 35:01.724
You didn't know
I could be this sharp.

35:01.793 --> 35:03.000
Damn, bro.

35:03.068 --> 35:04.172
I can be this sharp.

35:04.241 --> 35:06.206
Someone looking like
a whole snack tonight.

35:06.275 --> 35:08.862
Mm-hmm.Let me sit on your bed.

35:08.931 --> 35:10.344
What'd you get for me?
Anything good?

35:10.413 --> 35:11.482
You're gonna like this.

35:11.551 --> 35:16.275
Got something tasty,
sweet, and fun too.

35:16.344 --> 35:18.413
I know you won't
let me down.
Nah.

35:18.482 --> 35:20.655
Vinny gets me,
he knows exactly what I like,

35:20.724 --> 35:23.344
exactly what type, and he knows
exactly what I'm looking for

35:23.413 --> 35:25.137
at this point in my life.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.206
Look at him.

35:26.275 --> 35:27.586
What's up, brother!

35:27.655 --> 35:30.413
All dressed up,
he's about to find his Lauren,

35:30.482 --> 35:32.655
you know what I'm saying?
He's looking all tight
and whatnot.

35:32.724 --> 35:34.620
DJ Pauly D!

35:34.689 --> 35:37.241
I don't dress up often.
Only on special occasions.

35:37.310 --> 35:39.241
That's right.
You know we actually baking

35:39.310 --> 35:42.310
a cake for you right now.Oh yeah?

35:42.379 --> 35:43.965
Oh, my God.Funfetti's and all.

35:44.034 --> 35:45.275
Oh, nice.

35:45.344 --> 35:48.068
This kid cannot keep
a secret if he tried.

35:48.137 --> 35:50.379
Oh, my God.

35:50.448 --> 35:52.310
Like, bro, the cake
was the surprise.

35:52.379 --> 35:53.965
What the
are you doing?

35:54.034 --> 35:56.620
34 to 38...
This kid Mike

35:56.689 --> 35:58.344
is the stupidest mother
ever in my, in my life.

35:58.413 --> 35:59.724
What'd he say?
What'd he say?
Why?

35:59.793 --> 36:00.896
Did he ruin it?

36:00.965 --> 36:02.620
I go up and talk
to Pauly, right?

36:02.689 --> 36:04.068
This whole like,
"You're gonna like it.

36:04.137 --> 36:05.448
Got something really fun."

36:05.517 --> 36:06.862
Mike walks in the room
and goes,

36:06.931 --> 36:08.241
"Yo, we're making
a funfetti cake for you."

36:08.310 --> 36:10.827
Shut the  up!Oh my God!

36:10.896 --> 36:13.000
Can he just go away?

36:13.068 --> 36:14.896
I don't know what Mike did
back in the day,

36:14.965 --> 36:17.586
but it's like he has
no more brain cells left.

36:17.655 --> 36:19.068
I'm done,
I'm going to bed.

36:19.137 --> 36:20.758
Like, bitch, it's a secret.

36:20.827 --> 36:22.482
You just ruined
the  secret.

36:25.413 --> 36:26.655
We're telling you
zero things--

36:26.724 --> 36:28.172
Didn't we say the cake
was a surprise?

36:28.241 --> 36:29.379
Yeah, you're not gonna
know any secrets.

36:29.448 --> 36:30.482
You're on the outside
of the circle.

36:30.551 --> 36:32.000
I told him we're making him
a cake.

36:32.068 --> 36:33.137
Why?You weren't supposed to!

36:33.206 --> 36:35.344
No!Why?!

36:35.413 --> 36:37.103
We were gonna
give him the cake.That was the surprise.

36:37.172 --> 36:39.344
No, it's his special--
it's his special night.

36:39.413 --> 36:41.448
Now he knows.That was our surprise.

36:41.517 --> 36:44.344
I am so f... mad
right now at Mike.

36:44.413 --> 36:48.172
Now Pauly's expecting
a girl and a cake.

36:48.241 --> 36:50.413
Just end it for me, end it.

36:50.482 --> 36:52.896
cake's a cake.
You can't be mad, man.

36:52.965 --> 36:54.310
This is funfetti.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.620
Everyone loves
funfetti cake.

36:56.689 --> 36:58.586
I'm sorry,
I love funfetti cake.

36:58.655 --> 37:01.000
So  keep that
to yourself.

37:08.551 --> 37:11.172
Hey.

37:11.241 --> 37:12.793

37:14.827 --> 37:16.482
So come on, let's go.

37:16.551 --> 37:18.517
I waited all day, and so now
I'm like, super nervous.

37:18.586 --> 37:20.379
Like, they must have

Thank you.

37:24.862 --> 37:26.068
Vinny went to go get her.

37:26.137 --> 37:28.068
Get comfy.
You might get a lap dance.

37:28.137 --> 37:29.206
Uh-oh.

37:29.275 --> 37:31.275
Are you nervous?
We're very nervous.

37:31.344 --> 37:32.379
Getting red.

37:32.448 --> 37:33.896

37:33.965 --> 37:35.034
Oh, I'm ready.All right, Pauly's ready.

What is that, velvet?

37:57.896 --> 37:59.137
Velvet.

37:59.206 --> 38:01.000
Why do I have

ever want in a man.

38:36.655 --> 38:38.068

about getting
the bottle girl's number,

39:01.620 --> 39:03.137
and got in trouble.

39:03.206 --> 39:07.103
I am confused about what
my girl is so upset about.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Hello?

39:12.068 --> 39:13.827

I don't know.

39:16.172 --> 39:17.413
I remember you
being upset at me,

39:17.482 --> 39:19.137
so I kinda wanted
to talk about it.

39:19.206 --> 39:22.689

39:25.413 --> 39:27.137
Thank you for not doing

39:27.206 --> 39:28.965
all the worst things that you could be doing.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.758
But you wanna act like what you did

39:30.827 --> 39:33.862
was so appropriate and fine. You shouldn't have done it.

39:33.931 --> 39:35.206
Very calm.
He's very calm on the phone.

39:35.275 --> 39:36.482
He's very calm.

39:36.551 --> 39:38.310
Relationship's difficult,
and he's very calm.

39:38.379 --> 39:40.206
My mind is boggled.

39:40.275 --> 39:43.586
Like, it was just like
two girls' numbers.

39:43.655 --> 39:48.241
Communication.

Me and Pauly do it.
Everyone does it.

39:51.724 --> 39:53.482
That's not making it
any better.

39:53.551 --> 39:55.000
You're missing
the  point.

39:55.068 --> 39:56.827
Sorry.

39:56.896 --> 39:58.275
No, you're not.Won't happen again.

39:58.344 --> 39:59.758
I don't want your
band-aid apology.

39:59.827 --> 40:01.620
You don't want an apology,
and then you don't want me

40:01.689 --> 40:03.689

So what do I do?
