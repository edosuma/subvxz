09:25.730 --> 09:27.940
Stop playing, knock him out.

11:47.870 --> 11:48.700
What's up?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.660
You don't remember.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.500
Remember what?

11:53.630 --> 11:55.840
C'mon, Daddy. You promised.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.670
Five minutes.

12:28.910 --> 12:32.360
Would you like some more tea, princess?

12:32.560 --> 12:35.080
Yes. Thank you, kind sir.

15:52.950 --> 15:55.530
We're here to train,
we're here to fight, aren't we?

15:56.030 --> 15:58.410
You taught me that
and that is what we are going to do.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.330
Okay...

23:21.650 --> 23:23.560
There. Look at that.

23:23.900 --> 23:27.490
Who's the real champ in this family?

23:29.780 --> 23:30.560
You are.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.370
No. You.

23:32.570 --> 23:34.030
Go see for yourself.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.770
Thank you Grandma. I love you.

23:38.970 --> 23:39.870
You're welcome.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.250
I love you.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.330
Hey.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.960
No TV.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.300
Fine. I love you.

27:10.330 --> 27:14.500
Why's this kid picking on her?

27:17.550 --> 27:19.380
Sign.

27:20.630 --> 27:21.470
I'm sorry.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.600
I think...

27:22.850 --> 27:25.560
She probably wants to get some attention -

27:26.390 --> 27:29.390
So why's my daughter in trouble
and not her?

27:30.190 --> 27:32.900
She can't protect herself?

27:34.570 --> 27:37.070
Obviously we're concerned about Amara.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.930
Feeling comfortable here is important.

27:40.130 --> 27:41.010
Of course.

27:41.210 --> 27:45.950
But we understand fighting
isn't the way to handle things.

27:49.660 --> 27:53.860
Look, we love Amara.

27:54.060 --> 27:58.070
She's an academically exceptional child...

27:58.270 --> 27:59.160
She's thriving.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.840
She just... fights.

30:06.340 --> 30:08.800
Hey... dinner time.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.790
Need water?

30:42.090 --> 30:43.550
Thank you very much.

40:29.590 --> 40:31.260
What you up to, rascal?

40:31.680 --> 40:33.390
Oh, I was...

40:34.180 --> 40:35.930
I was cleaning.

40:36.890 --> 40:39.140
That's not what Uncle Duke told me...

40:41.940 --> 40:45.020
I don't want to get in trouble.

40:45.770 --> 40:47.770
Mom doesn't want me to fight.

40:51.990 --> 40:53.930
How 'bout it's our little secret.

40:54.130 --> 40:54.930
Yes!

40:55.130 --> 40:57.410
Want me to show you all the other stuff?

40:57.610 --> 40:58.490
Yes!

41:05.130 --> 41:06.500
That's called a straight right.

41:06.960 --> 41:09.170
That's how you knocked out Wheeler?

41:09.840 --> 41:11.340
Who taught you that?

41:12.590 --> 41:13.550
You.

41:14.590 --> 41:15.840
You watched that fight?

41:17.720 --> 41:22.020
I've watched all your fights.

41:23.770 --> 41:25.850
Show me something else.

41:27.940 --> 41:31.930
Most people think it's about violence
but it's not.

41:32.130 --> 41:34.570
It's timing and focus and...

41:34.860 --> 41:36.160
Control?

41:59.010 --> 42:01.260
Perfect.

48:35.490 --> 48:36.910
What do you think?

48:37.990 --> 48:39.290
Do you trust him?

48:40.080 --> 48:41.370
Yes, of course.

48:41.910 --> 48:43.540
Ok so let's go.

55:14.350 --> 55:18.290
Dame needs to start strong.

55:18.490 --> 55:20.250
It will be quick.

55:20.450 --> 55:22.480
Because Felix is a beast.

56:53.030 --> 56:54.320
Son! Listen to me.

56:56.200 --> 56:57.080
Everything's going to be alright.

59:49.370 --> 59:50.210
We gotta go.

1:10:09.370 --> 1:10:10.620
I love you.

1:47:29.060 --> 1:47:31.230
Ready?

1:48:06.850 --> 1:48:08.390
I'm the champ!

1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:19.530
Home?
