1
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.750
Adonis?

2
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.340
Thought you got scared.

3
00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:39.740
About to roll without you.

4
00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:41.700
Come on, bro.

5
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.659
Aight.

6
00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.789
Hey, yo, Adonis. This way.

7
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.210
Hey, yo, H should
be expecting us.

8
00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:59.639
- Here we go. It's showtime.
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:06.310
Hold up. Shh, shh.

10
00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:13.080
About time, young
gun. Back there.

11
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.400
For sure.

12
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.530
- Dame.
- What's the deal, man?

13
00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:23.920
- What, you got me next?
- I got you, champ.

14
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.199
My guy.

15
00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.840
- Hey, Dame.
- What's up?

16
00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.449
- Who's your friend?
- My name's Donnie.

17
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.240
Nice to meet you.
How y'all doing today?

18
00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.189
Boy, come on, man.
Come on. Focus up, man.

19
00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:37.819
We got plenty of time for that.

20
00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.069
Trust.

21
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.030
Ooh. Hello, pot. Man,
you see that ring?

22
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.550
That's easy money.

23
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.920
And I ain't even tell
you who you've got yet.

24
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.569
Come on.

25
00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:52.829
Let's get it.

26
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.300
Michael Fitzbaum.

27
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.219
Orthodox. Solid fighter.

28
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.280
Say he gonna be the
first cat to knock you out.

29
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.219
Hey, but he do got a good jab.

30
00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.009
He overreaches though.

31
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.530
He tore his labrum last year
playing football for Pali, so...

32
00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.270
- Make him miss.
- Yeah.

33
00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:12.319
The right gonna be open.

34
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.030
Aight.

35
00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:27.899
On you?

36
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.029
Come on, man.

37
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.310
Yeah.

38
00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:33.050
See you out there.

39
00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:42.829
First round knockout. Damian.

40
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:44.699
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight's fighters

41
00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:47.000
for the regional
Golden Gloves title.

42
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.620
6'2'', from Pacific
Palisades, California,

43
00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.709
Michael Fitzbaum.

44
00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.709
6'1'', fighting out of the
Crenshaw District of Los Angeles,

45
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.149
- "Diamond" Dame Anderson.
- Come on, Dame! Let's go.

46
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.819
Yeah.

47
00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.389
Yeah!

48
00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:13.339
Fight.

49
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.209
Show him what
you're made of, boy.

50
00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.910
Watch the right.

51
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.300
Hey, watch that jab.

52
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.490
Hey, be patient. Be patient.

53
00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.100
Keep that guard up, bro.

54
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.759
Wait for it. It's
gonna come to you.

55
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.629
Watch this. Checkmate.

56
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.319
Oh, my God! Come on!

57
00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:49.019
And the winner,
by way of knockout,

58
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.939
- new Golden Gloves champion...
- What'd I say, boy? That's how I do.

59
00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.990
..."Diamond" Dame Anderson!

60
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:56.129
Yeah.

61
00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:59.029
Let's get it, boy.

62
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.819
Let's get it, man.
What did I tell you, huh?

63
00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:03.300
What'd I tell you? I
sat that boy down.

64
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.040
That straight right, it's clean.
That's the perfect punch.

65
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.649
Bro, but when you put him to
sleep, though, everybody was--

66
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.180
- What?
- He was over there like--

67
00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:15.879
Man, the first
thing I'ma do, man--

68
00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:18.050
The first thing I'ma do,

69
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.620
I'ma get me one of
them big-ass diamonds.

70
00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.360
Hey.

71
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.290
I'ma get you one
too, little homey.

72
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.029
Hey.

73
00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.019
Yes, sir.

74
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.980
- Appreciate you.
- No doubt, man.

75
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.500
- For real.
- No doubt.

76
00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.909
You know, actually, I
got you something too.

77
00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.209
It belonged to my pops.

78
00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:40.730
It's original.

79
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.740
Rumble in the Jungle?

80
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.860
Yeah.

81
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.000
Yeah.

82
00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:49.529
I'ma get there one day.

83
00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:52.189
Yeah, I'ma get there.

84
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.100
I'ma win nationals,

85
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.439
taking home the
gold at the Olympics,

86
00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.980
and then I'm turning pro.

87
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.980
Don't trip. You'll be
right there with me.

88
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.360
Shit, someone
gotta carry my bags.

89
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.029
Bro, why you gotta play
with me like that, bro?

90
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.670
I already know what I
want. What you getting?

91
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.240
- Cherry pie, apple pie.
- Cherry pie?

92
00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.329
- Got you. Chili cheese fries?
- Yeah, come on.

93
00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:21.029
- Pineapple soda?
- All that.

94
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.430
All on you, boy. Big money.

95
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:28.470
Leon?

96
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.180
Huh?

97
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.870
Don't remember me, do you?

98
00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:34.909
Am I supposed to remember you?

99
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.269
Not so little anymore.

100
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.490
My name's Donnie.
You remember me now?

101
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.439
We're live, round one,
Cape Town, South Africa,

102
00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.790
as Adonis Creed
battles his old rival

103
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.360
in what Creed has
said will be his final fight.

104
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.970
Todd Grisham alongside the
champion, Jessica McCaskill.

105
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.149
And right out of the gate
with an impressive combo.

106
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.149
Is Conlan looking this good
or Creed looking this bad?

107
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.069
If he doesn't do something fast,

108
00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:03.769
he's going to end
his historic career

109
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.459
with another loss to Conlan.

110
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.040
- There we go.
- Put that jab in his face.

111
00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:11.529
Okay. Same Creed.
Ain't nothing changed.

112
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.079
Conlan stalking his prey,

113
00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:17.000
pushing Creed
towards the corner.

114
00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.170
You've got to wonder

115
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.269
if the moment is
getting to Creed here.

116
00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:25.180
Conlan is banging
away with the right hand.

117
00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:27.009
Look to your right.

118
00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:28.439
Seems to be the same combination

119
00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:30.410
he's throwing over and
over, and Creed can't stop it.

120
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.809
Creed, getting
out of the corner.

121
00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.539
Good jab, but
Conlan not fazed at all.

122
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.720
Keep that in his face.
Keep that jab out there.

123
00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:47.029
- Big left from Conlan.
- Get off that rope.

124
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.639
Oh, he's got him on the
ropes. Clean shots landing.

125
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.350
Creed taking quite a beating.

126
00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:55.730
And wow. Conlan almost had him.

127
00:08:55.929 --> 00:08:58.820
Next round's gonna hurt,
champ. Next round's gonna hurt.

128
00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:01.559
You okay, Donnie?

129
00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:03.909
Come on, Donnie.
You gotta work, baby.

130
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.610
Yo, what you smiling for, dawg?

131
00:09:06.809 --> 00:09:08.830
He over there beating
you worse than last time.

132
00:09:09.029 --> 00:09:10.700
Like, is something
I miss that's funny?

133
00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:13.789
Yeah, man. Checkmate.

134
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.230
Checkmate? Oh, okay.
You sure about that?

135
00:09:17.429 --> 00:09:19.120
I ain't never been
scared of a little contact.

136
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.370
I'm going out how I came in.

137
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.460
Man, you're crazy, all right.

138
00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:27.809
Stop playing, knock him out.

139
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:29.590
- How you feeling? Looking great.
- I'm just warming up.

140
00:09:29.789 --> 00:09:31.809
He had a good run.

141
00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:33.299
But it's time to take
back what's ours.

142
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.529
Creed's had a remarkable career,

143
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.049
but you wonder if Father Time
has finally caught up with the champ.

144
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.720
This is getting
dangerous for Creed.

145
00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.659
Ooh, the champ
finally lands one.

146
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.620
Come on, Donnie. Work
this. Show him who's champ.

147
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.669
Beautiful, Ricky.
Beautiful. Just like that.

148
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:05.809
One more time.

149
00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:25.519
And down goes
Conlan! He goes down!

150
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.210
What a moment! And I don't
think he's gonna get up, Jessica.

151
00:10:28.409 --> 00:10:32.000
Three, four, five,

152
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.049
six, seven,

153
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.269
eight,

154
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.919
nine,

155
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.049
ten.

156
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.049
Yeah!

157
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.230
And that's it, folks.

158
00:10:40.429 --> 00:10:41.450
It's over.

159
00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:43.840
What a chess move
from Adonis Creed.

160
00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:44.970
Just incredible.

161
00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:46.799
What a turn. What an ending.

162
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.059
That's how you go out.

163
00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:52.409
Who would expect anything
less from Adonis Creed

164
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.500
as he takes his final
bow on the world stage?

165
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.679
What an exit.

166
00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:58.850
Respect, Conlan.
Hell of a fight.

167
00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:02.070
And that means we've
got a new, undisputed

168
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:03.600
heavyweight
champion of the world

169
00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:05.769
for the first time
in two decades,

170
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.049
and his name is Adonis Creed.

171
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.769
What's up?

172
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.480
You don't remember.

173
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.269
Remember what?

174
00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:55.450
C'mon, Daddy. You promised.

175
00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.490
Five minutes.

176
00:12:05.409 --> 00:12:06.629
Okay, okay, okay.

177
00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:15.860
Yes. All right.

178
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.120
Would you like some
more tea, princess?

179
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.750
Yes. Thank you, kind sir.

180
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.370
This is hot.

181
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.809
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

182
00:13:06.009 --> 00:13:07.289
This the track you've been
working on for Kehlani?

183
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.679
- Yeah.
- Okay.

184
00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:10.509
We had a good
session, but I don't know.

185
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.470
What you mean you don't
know? Can you send this to me?

186
00:13:12.669 --> 00:13:14.210
- Yes, yes.
- I need this in the car.

187
00:13:14.409 --> 00:13:15.690
How was today?

188
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:17.299
- It was good. Yeah.
- Yeah?

189
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.080
- Thank you for holding it down.
- I got you.

190
00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:21.389
Did you get her to bed?

191
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.740
- I did.
- Mmm.

192
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.429
So, I'm not gonna lie.

193
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:26.259
I had to bribe her with
about six scoops of ice cream.

194
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.519
I don't even know how she sleep.

195
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.610
Retirement made you
soft, you know that?

196
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.480
I can't tell that girl no.

197
00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:33.789
I think you had a couple scoops
too 'cause look, you got this.

198
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.879
- Mmm.
- Uh-huh.

199
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.450
- Yeah, that's bad.
- Yeah.

200
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.240
Take that off
before it stains, D.

201
00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:40.970
Oh, I see what
you're trying to do.

202
00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:42.450
What's that?

203
00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:44.669
You're trying to get me naked.

204
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.940
Oh, no, no. I'm definitely not trying
to do that 'cause I'm trying to work.

205
00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:48.200
I see what you
were trying to do.

206
00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:50.370
No, you can just
own it. It's okay.

207
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.720
I know you just
wanna see all this.

208
00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:53.200
- No, no, no.
- Look at that.

209
00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.330
No.

210
00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:57.080
Still hot? Still warm?

211
00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:59.080
- Stop it.
- I'm working, D. Please.

212
00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:00.860
I'm working too. Listen,
I don't get a chance to--

213
00:14:01.059 --> 00:14:03.129
What are you working on?

214
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.519
I don't get no alone time with you
no more 'cause you be hard at work.

215
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.649
I know. Yeah.

216
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.480
- You ain't got no time for me.
- I know.

217
00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:10.179
You ain't got time for--

218
00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:12.529
- I know, but I don't have time now.
- So come on. You don't?

219
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.450
- No. No.
- Just a little bit. Just a little bit.

220
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.629
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

221
00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:21.580
Don't you miss when...

222
00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:25.279
we used to... ...anywhere.

223
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.580
- Any place?
- Mm-hmm.

224
00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:29.669
Mm-mmm. Okay.

225
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.889
Okay, let's go.

226
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.980
Okay, I just-- I have,
like, about 15 minutes

227
00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:34.940
- because I have to send these stems.
- Fifteen.

228
00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:36.330
How about 12?

229
00:14:36.529 --> 00:14:37.870
All right. Twelve will do.

230
00:14:43.539 --> 00:14:45.700
Next stop, Leimert Park.

231
00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:11.470
Body, head. Body, head.

232
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.809
Efficiency over power,
baby. Give it to him.

233
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.509
Technique. Technique, Felix.

234
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.029
You can't just punch
your way through Drago.

235
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.210
We got a plan, so stick to it.

236
00:15:26.409 --> 00:15:28.340
- Come on. Make him work for it.
- Let's go.

237
00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:30.870
It's not only about
power. It's timing, speed.

238
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.220
- Shit, you're telling me? Come on now.
- I know, I know.

239
00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:34.610
Keep drilling into him.

240
00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.779
Technique. Technique.

241
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.919
Time.

242
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.870
Hey! Time!

243
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.279
Felix. Get over here.

244
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.750
These guys are trash.

245
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.750
We need a new batch,
and we need it fast.

246
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.230
It's hard. You've chewed
through most of LA.

247
00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:53.059
You want me to pull back? You
know Drago ain't taking it easy.

248
00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:55.980
We're here to train, we're
here to fight, aren't we?

249
00:15:56.179 --> 00:15:58.080
You taught me that and that
is what we are going to do.

250
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.370
Okay...

251
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.509
Hey, Felix. Ven aqui.

252
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.769
What's up, champ? You wanna
help me with some rounds?

253
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.210
What, and mess up
this suit? I don't think so.

254
00:16:07.409 --> 00:16:09.429
I'm trying to get
you paid, Felix.

255
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:11.039
We can't get you paid
if you keep knocking out

256
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.649
all these sparring
partners, okay?

257
00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.820
You gotta be ready to
fight Drago in four weeks.

258
00:16:15.019 --> 00:16:17.090
You're the champ. We
know you got power.

259
00:16:17.289 --> 00:16:19.220
But it's not always about
how hard you can hit.

260
00:16:19.419 --> 00:16:21.570
- It's about control and focus.
- You're right.

261
00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:22.710
Listen to Duke.

262
00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:25.789
Yes, sir.

263
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.710
See? You play too much.

264
00:16:28.909 --> 00:16:30.230
- Listen to Duke.
- Did you hear that?

265
00:16:30.429 --> 00:16:32.269
"Listen to Duke."

266
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.100
Those three words.
Not "I love you."

267
00:16:35.299 --> 00:16:37.669
Not "take it easy."
None of that.

268
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.629
"Listen to Duke."

269
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.240
I understand exactly
what they're asking.

270
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.809
Drago's got a bigger name,
that's true, but Felix got the belt.

271
00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:48.250
His split's got to be bigger.

272
00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.570
I don't care if they don't
like it. Tell Drago to call me.

273
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.049
Hey, let me call you right back.

274
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.570
Hey, my man.

275
00:16:57.009 --> 00:16:59.129
Can I help you?

276
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.909
- Let me get an autograph.
- No, I ain't signing no autographs.

277
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.799
Would you get off my car?

278
00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:06.799
Oh, homey.

279
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.630
You don't remember me, huh?

280
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.759
You come a long way from
bumming rides from your mom.

281
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.539
Dame.

282
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.160
Boy, you had me.

283
00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:23.720
Damian.

284
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.329
Yeah, just got back to the hood.

285
00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:27.329
Stopped by the
old gym, but, uh...

286
00:17:27.529 --> 00:17:29.980
Yeah, we upgraded a
couple years ago, you know?

287
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.950
I see.

288
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.390
- Damn, it's, uh...
- It's been a minute.

289
00:17:37.569 --> 00:17:38.609
Been a minute.

290
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.390
Hey, I don't wanna take up
your time or nothing, man.

291
00:17:43.589 --> 00:17:45.089
I just wanted to let
you know what's good.

292
00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:46.740
I'm around.

293
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.619
If you wanna catch up, you
know, you just let me know.

294
00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.980
Where you about to head now?

295
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.029
Shit, back to the crib.

296
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.640
You got time to get some grub?

297
00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:07.200
Thank you.

298
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.250
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

299
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.700
I'm surprised you still come
here and eat with the common folk.

300
00:18:22.349 --> 00:18:24.170
I mean, when I can.

301
00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:26.559
There's a lot of things I used
to do that I can't do anymore.

302
00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:28.220
Busy living that high life, huh?

303
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.059
Yeah. Guess it
comes with the job.

304
00:18:31.619 --> 00:18:33.089
All right.

305
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:35.569
Yo-- Easy, easy. Damn, bruh.

306
00:18:35.769 --> 00:18:37.279
You know how long it's
been since I had this shit?

307
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.200
How long?

308
00:18:41.069 --> 00:18:42.109
Eighteen years, bro.

309
00:18:43.809 --> 00:18:45.119
You've been down
this whole time?

310
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.299
Had a few years
tacked on, but... yeah.

311
00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:54.859
Just got out last week.

312
00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.299
Well, congratulations on that.

313
00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.259
Thank you.

314
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:04.400
Wrote you a few times.

315
00:19:06.089 --> 00:19:08.440
- You did? Where'd you send 'em?
- Mama Creed's.

316
00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:13.779
She still up in Bel Air?

317
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.279
Yeah, she's still
there. Same house.

318
00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:17.319
But I never got 'em.

319
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:27.880
You know I watched every
one of your fights in the pen.

320
00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:29.549
You finally made
it to Africa, huh?

321
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.890
- You seen that?
- Saw that.

322
00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:36.279
Made me proud how
you ended your run.

323
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.730
Look like you still remember
some of them moves I taught you.

324
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.779
You know what I remember?

325
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.119
You knocking my ass out.

326
00:19:50.349 --> 00:19:51.829
You know what I remember?

327
00:19:53.619 --> 00:19:54.920
Helping your big ass back up.

328
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.970
Remember that?

329
00:19:59.099 --> 00:20:00.759
- Yeah, you did.
- All right, then.

330
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:07.809
You got work?

331
00:20:10.369 --> 00:20:12.589
I got plans.

332
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:16.500
Keep my nose clean.
Keep my PO off my ass.

333
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.640
Mm.

334
00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:25.200
Listen, if there's
anything I can do for you,

335
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.740
if I can help at all, just ask.

336
00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:33.349
What am I talking about?
You just came home.

337
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.579
Whatever you need.
Aight? Don't hesitate, bruh.

338
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.619
I'm straight, bro.

339
00:20:46.819 --> 00:20:48.789
I'm good. I got it all situated.

340
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.880
I ain't come to see
you for no handout.

341
00:20:51.079 --> 00:20:52.460
Nah, I didn't mean
it like that. It was...

342
00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.420
Respect.

343
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.759
So, what's the plan?

344
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.170
Same program last
time you saw me.

345
00:21:05.559 --> 00:21:07.000
I wanna be champ.

346
00:21:11.829 --> 00:21:12.990
You still wanna box?

347
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.920
Hey, I know I've
been away a long time.

348
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.700
I kept myself in shape.

349
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.259
I got some moves
you ain't seen yet.

350
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.450
Yeah. You...

351
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.970
- You looking diesel.
- I ain't joking.

352
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.019
I'm ready.

353
00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:30.500
I still got gas in the tank.

354
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.630
And I gotta get me that chain.

355
00:21:35.289 --> 00:21:37.029
Can't be "Diamond"
Dame looking bummy.

356
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.990
"Diamond" Dame.

357
00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.339
That's right.

358
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.869
All right.

359
00:21:51.819 --> 00:21:52.910
Come by the gym.

360
00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:54.869
Get you set up with Duke.

361
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.700
- For real?
- Yeah.

362
00:22:02.359 --> 00:22:03.269
For real.

363
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.400
All right, then.

364
00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.319
Thank you.

365
00:22:30.039 --> 00:22:31.470
Yo, yo, yo!

366
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:43.690
What's so funny?

367
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.210
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to convince
your mama to come live with us,

368
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.650
so I can have my
own live-in braider.

369
00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.130
Yeah. Careful what you wish for.

370
00:22:54.329 --> 00:22:55.539
Oh, I'm not worried.

371
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.490
It's actually not a bad idea.

372
00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.660
And how you feeling,
Mama? You good?

373
00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:04.140
I'm good.

374
00:23:04.339 --> 00:23:06.230
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

375
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:07.799
Okay.

376
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.599
I'd be better if my son
showed up on time for dinner.

377
00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:15.109
Ouch. Uh, sorry.

378
00:23:15.309 --> 00:23:16.809
- Mmm.
- I just got caught up.

379
00:23:17.009 --> 00:23:18.000
Mm-hmm.

380
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.690
There. Look at that.

381
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.089
Who's the real
champ in this family?

382
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.210
You are.

383
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.299
No. You.

384
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.750
Go see for yourself.

385
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.440
Thank you Grandma. I love you.

386
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.880
You're welcome.

387
00:23:40.079 --> 00:23:41.220
I love you.

388
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.359
Hey.

389
00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:43.630
No TV.

390
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.539
Fine. I love you.

391
00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.119
You're gonna have your
hands full with that one.

392
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.500
We already do.

393
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.470
- No. She's the best.
- Yes, we do.

394
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.240
She is.

395
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.109
- You're the worst.
- Oh, come on, Mama.

396
00:24:02.309 --> 00:24:04.480
- You're the worst.
- Stop... You don't mean it.

397
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.960
- Here, Ma.
- Thank you.

398
00:24:07.869 --> 00:24:09.640
B, think that's a good idea?

399
00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:11.250
Baby, not tonight.

400
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.690
But we talked about this.

401
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.839
- One thing at a time.
- Okay.

402
00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:23.660
Okay. We are not doing
this this evening, okay?

403
00:24:23.859 --> 00:24:25.539
And just so we're straight

404
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.880
and everybody knows,

405
00:24:29.079 --> 00:24:30.500
I am not leaving my house.

406
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:32.490
Understood?

407
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.150
Mm-hmm.

408
00:24:34.349 --> 00:24:36.710
- Okay.
- Okay.

409
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.500
And I really am fine.

410
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.200
I promise you, I am not gonna
have another stroke tonight.

411
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.079
Okay?

412
00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:44.980
Have it tomorrow night.

413
00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.549
Mom. That's...

414
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:48.809
That's not funny.

415
00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:50.210
It's a little funny.

416
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.079
And you're not helping.

417
00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:54.339
You know that we're
worried about you.

418
00:24:54.539 --> 00:24:55.730
- That's it. We can leave it now.
- I...

419
00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.569
And we wanna be
careful after the last one.

420
00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.529
I am fine.

421
00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.230
Okay?

422
00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:06.180
But what about you?

423
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.440
What's up with you?

424
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.240
Yeah. Where were you, D?

425
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.109
Just ran into this
guy named Dame.

426
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.549
Damian.

427
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:18.410
Who's he?

428
00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:27.130
Think you might've checked with
me? This ain't no damn charity.

429
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.990
And homey older than you.

430
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.730
I'm just trying to give him a break.
Isn't that what we do anyway?

431
00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.430
No! This ain't the YMCA.

432
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:37.990
Look around, Duke.

433
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.700
You see anybody lining up
to get in the ring with Felix?

434
00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:43.480
All I'm saying is, let him spar.

435
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.869
Felix got a fight coming
up, and we have zero bodies.

436
00:25:47.069 --> 00:25:49.049
I mean, absolutely nobody
wants to get in the ring with Felix.

437
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.369
I know what you doin', Donnie.

438
00:25:51.589 --> 00:25:53.539
You don't owe this dude shit.

439
00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.329
Nothing.

440
00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.160
But let's spar.

441
00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160
Let's do it.

442
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.670
Felix, Felix, yo. Listen up.

443
00:26:05.869 --> 00:26:07.339
Adonis brought
somebody in for you to spar.

444
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.690
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

445
00:26:11.819 --> 00:26:13.480
- Huh?
- We on.

446
00:26:20.349 --> 00:26:21.529
Lot of young cats in here.

447
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.750
Young man's game.

448
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.710
Don't worry, Duke's
gonna take care of you.

449
00:26:29.009 --> 00:26:30.440
We back to ground zero.

450
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.190
Champs gotta start
somewhere, right?

451
00:26:38.849 --> 00:26:40.660
All right.

452
00:26:40.859 --> 00:26:44.730
Felix, meet Damian.
He gonna spar with you.

453
00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:47.380
You still remember
how to do that, yeah?

454
00:26:49.119 --> 00:26:50.940
You got this.

455
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.000
Felix, stay focused. Work
on timing. That's all we need.

456
00:27:10.099 --> 00:27:14.279
Why's this kid picking on her?

457
00:27:15.019 --> 00:27:16.059
Well, I'm just asking.

458
00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:19.150
Sign.

459
00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.359
I'm sorry.

460
00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:22.619
I think...

461
00:27:22.819 --> 00:27:26.279
She probably wants
to get some attention -

462
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.160
Hold on. Why is my daughter
in trouble and not her?

463
00:27:30.069 --> 00:27:32.559
She can't protect herself?

464
00:27:34.339 --> 00:27:37.369
Obviously we're
concerned about Amara.

465
00:27:37.569 --> 00:27:39.640
Feeling comfortable
here is important.

466
00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:41.549
Of course.

467
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:45.609
But we understand fighting
isn't the way to handle things.

468
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.339
Mm-hmm.

469
00:27:49.539 --> 00:27:53.740
Look, we love Amara.

470
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.740
She's an academically
exceptional child...

471
00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.869
She's thriving.

472
00:27:59.069 --> 00:28:02.450
She just... fights.

473
00:28:05.109 --> 00:28:07.579
So, you wanna teach her how
to fight? That's your advice?

474
00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:09.750
I didn't think I had to,
at a deaf school like that,

475
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.230
- but maybe I was wrong.
- Wait.

476
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:16.109
What does that mean, "at a deaf school
like that," like they're not still kids?

477
00:28:16.309 --> 00:28:17.759
I mean, what did
you expect, Adonis?

478
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.500
Then she should learn
how to defend herself.

479
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.980
Okay, first of all,
I'm not saying that

480
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.549
she shouldn't know
how to defend herself.

481
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.160
I'm just saying what
that means to me

482
00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:25.990
is different than
what it means to you.

483
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.640
What if she's someplace she's
supposed to be safe, and she's not?

484
00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:31.269
She won't know
how to protect herself.

485
00:28:32.529 --> 00:28:33.440
Where's that coming from?

486
00:28:35.049 --> 00:28:37.490
Nowhere. It's just a fact.

487
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.519
Okay.

488
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.569
Another fact is that,
I think, as parents,

489
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:43.960
it's actually our responsibility

490
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.140
to teach her how to
assess her emotions.

491
00:28:46.339 --> 00:28:49.180
So you want Amara, right,
to hold hands with this bully

492
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.009
and start talking
about her feelings?

493
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.140
That's not real life.

494
00:28:52.339 --> 00:28:53.839
Okay, what do
you want her to do?

495
00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:55.799
You want her to never talk
about her feelings to anyone?

496
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.589
Not even to us, and all she can
do about them is to hit somebody?

497
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:02.589
Look, I know that you think
that that has worked for you,

498
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:04.460
but now that you don't
have an outlet anymore,

499
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.940
you should think about maybe
talking about how you feel.

500
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.119
If not to me, to somebody.

501
00:29:09.319 --> 00:29:10.960
Or, I don't know,
D. Get a hobby.

502
00:29:12.259 --> 00:29:13.730
- Okay, I'll get a hobby.
- Oh, yeah?

503
00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:15.779
Yeah, you.

504
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.730
I'ma go down to the studio.
I'ma start laying tracks with you.

505
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.779
That's not funny, D.

506
00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.960
Look, I know that you think
that you are protecting her, baby,

507
00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.880
but she has got to know why she
wants to fight, not just how to do it.

508
00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:30.359
And the only solution to every
problem is not a punch in the face.

509
00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:32.490
Yeah, you're right.
And sometimes it is.

510
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:39.289
All right, let's just
have a good time.

511
00:29:41.819 --> 00:29:43.799
Okay, I see you
made it all right.

512
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.460
Oh, yeah. I just asked him,
"Where the Black family live at?"

513
00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.720
- I'm kidding.
- Yeah.

514
00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.940
- What's up, man?
- 'Sup?

515
00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.069
There's other ones around.

516
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:54.680
I ain't see none. Here you go.

517
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.119
Thank you.

518
00:29:56.319 --> 00:29:57.990
- Nice to meet you, Ms. Bianca.
- Pleasure.

519
00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.470
- You never bought me no flowers.
- What, you want a kiss?

520
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.259
- Nah. I'm okay. No, no, it's all right.
- Come here.

521
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.869
- Hey, y'all got a beautiful home.
- - Thank you.

522
00:30:06.069 --> 00:30:09.130
Hey... dinner time.

523
00:30:09.329 --> 00:30:10.500
You got the see-through floors?

524
00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:13.319
Oh.

525
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.589
Whoa. All right.

526
00:30:17.589 --> 00:30:18.759
Amara.

527
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.549
- Amara?
- Mm-hmm.

528
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:25.599
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

529
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.119
Nice to meet you.

530
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.200
She says, "You too."

531
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.289
Ah, hell yeah.

532
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.609
Need water?

533
00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:40.480
Thank you again.

534
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.039
Thank you very much.

535
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.869
Dawg, I still
can't get over this.

536
00:30:45.069 --> 00:30:47.349
This square got him
a whole mansion.

537
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:50.309
Married a-- a genuine rock star.

538
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:51.799
- Yeah, I did.
- Mmm.

539
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.960
How many gold records you got?

540
00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.880
- I have a few.
- She bein' modest.

541
00:30:57.079 --> 00:30:58.880
She bein' real modest.

542
00:30:59.079 --> 00:31:02.579
No, but it's mostly artists I
produce, but, yeah, I got some.

543
00:31:02.779 --> 00:31:05.059
- And she produces?
- She does.

544
00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:08.410
Donnie. You punching up.

545
00:31:08.609 --> 00:31:11.200
So, Ms. Producer,
when's your next show?

546
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.759
I don't really perform
like that these days.

547
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.980
Yeah, I took a
break, 'cause I was...

548
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.990
I was having some issues
with my hearing on stage.

549
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.380
Now I'm trying to be careful
and preserve what I've got left,

550
00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:23.829
so, I'm producing.

551
00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:26.690
Yeah.

552
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.400
Not any time soon.

553
00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.609
Still hard to give that
part up, though. Right?

554
00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:37.220
Yeah. It's not the only
thing I love, but it takes work.

555
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.740
- It's an adjustment...
- Mm-hmm.

556
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.920
...for the both of us.

557
00:31:40.119 --> 00:31:43.009
So, how long have
you known each other?

558
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.359
- I mean...
- We go back. Way back.

559
00:31:45.559 --> 00:31:49.539
We was like... We
was like brothers.

560
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.549
Shared a room for
two years at the Jeff.

561
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.980
Yeah, something like that.

562
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.109
You know how it went. He
went off and got all Hollywood.

563
00:31:57.309 --> 00:31:58.549
The Jeff, right.

564
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.819
Yeah, the group home.

565
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.039
You remember them bedbugs?

566
00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:06.380
I try to forget 'em.

567
00:32:06.579 --> 00:32:07.700
Yeah.

568
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.359
I can't forget them bugs.

569
00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:16.430
- I'm gonna get her to bed.
- Okay.

570
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:19.180
- You two stay, catch up.
- Okay.

571
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.180
Oh, invite him
to the label party.

572
00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.609
- Definitely will do that.
- Yeah.

573
00:32:22.809 --> 00:32:24.829
I heard that. I'm
invited to the label party.

574
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:27.359
- You're invited.
- Thank you.

575
00:32:27.559 --> 00:32:29.799
Yeah. Thank you
so much for coming.

576
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.069
- Yeah, no doubt. My pleasure to meet you.
- Mmm.

577
00:32:41.339 --> 00:32:44.250
I can't believe you moved
back out here to the boonies.

578
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.599
You used to love coming
out to the hood. Now you all...

579
00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:48.680
What?

580
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.819
- Domesticated and shit.
- Ah, come on, man.

581
00:32:51.019 --> 00:32:52.910
See what happens
when you get married.

582
00:32:53.109 --> 00:32:54.730
- Yeah, all right, bro.
- Aight?

583
00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:57.099
- The women run this household.
- I just live here.

584
00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.410
That's what happens, man.
You get married, a family.

585
00:33:02.099 --> 00:33:03.150
It's crazy.

586
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.279
Pour up.

587
00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.769
Can't believe you traded
it in for a monkey suit.

588
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.779
Oh, you know, a suit
has some advantages.

589
00:33:33.869 --> 00:33:36.730
You saying that like I got
soft or something, like...

590
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.730
- Like I lost this sneak-attack.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

591
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:41.000
Okay, I see. The champ's
still got some pepper in him.

592
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.930
All I'm saying is, I left boxing,
but boxing didn't leave me.

593
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.230
See, that's what
I'm saying, bro.

594
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.700
I mean, look, I know you
got a ship to run, and whatnot,

595
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.009
but I ain't keep
my stuff together

596
00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.809
just to be some punching
bag for some chump.

597
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:57.619
You feel me?

598
00:33:57.819 --> 00:33:59.859
Don't sleep on Felix. Aight?

599
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:03.079
He got it the hard
way. He earned it.

600
00:34:04.599 --> 00:34:06.210
I did 18 years
the hard way, bro.

601
00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:12.260
Maybe I ain't make myself clear.

602
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.829
I want a title shot.

603
00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:19.690
Dame...

604
00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:22.079
I don't know what you think,
but it don't work like that.

605
00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.130
Felix so cold, what he got to
lose? What you got to lose?

606
00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:27.349
You think I can snap my fingers
and make you a contender overnight?

607
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:28.710
Ain't that what happened to you?

608
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.460
It's like this, bro.

609
00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.159
I respect you...

610
00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.320
but my clock tickin'.

611
00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:49.940
It's now or never for me.

612
00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:52.730
And I wanna help
you, like I said I would.

613
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.389
But, man, what
you asking me, it's...

614
00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.389
it's kinda impossible.

615
00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.750
You don't know
what it's like, bro.

616
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.789
All that time in them...

617
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.750
in them walls.

618
00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:18.889
Impossible?

619
00:35:21.809 --> 00:35:22.849
They take your name.

620
00:35:23.679 --> 00:35:25.030
And they give you a number.

621
00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:28.900
That's how it start.

622
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.510
I was the best, though.

623
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.260
Yeah, you were.

624
00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:37.300
I was, bro.

625
00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.739
But I never got a
chance to prove that.

626
00:35:42.699 --> 00:35:45.170
Look, all I'm saying, bro, if--

627
00:35:45.369 --> 00:35:49.530
If Apollo Creed could take a
chance on some underdog...

628
00:35:51.269 --> 00:35:52.320
why can't you?

629
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.500
Did you sleep okay?

630
00:36:08.769 --> 00:36:10.280
Mm-hmm.

631
00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.769
You were grinding your teeth.

632
00:36:14.469 --> 00:36:15.949
How was the rest of last night?

633
00:36:16.769 --> 00:36:18.500
Mm...

634
00:36:18.699 --> 00:36:21.329
- It was, uh... It was good.
- Yeah?

635
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:22.739
Just catching up.

636
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Hey, why didn't you ever
tell me about the group home?

637
00:36:31.179 --> 00:36:32.699
There wasn't a lot to say.

638
00:36:35.489 --> 00:36:36.530
Hmm.

639
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.710
How old were you?

640
00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:43.760
Uh, I was around Amara's age.

641
00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.239
You don't wanna talk about it?

642
00:36:50.809 --> 00:36:51.980
It's okay.

643
00:36:54.769 --> 00:36:55.940
- No.
- It's okay.

644
00:36:57.989 --> 00:36:58.900
Nah, it's Dame.

645
00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.300
You know he asked
me to fight Felix?

646
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.900
- For real?
- Yeah.

647
00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:08.829
Heavyweight champion of
the world, and he wants a shot.

648
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:10.389
So what'd you say?

649
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.039
I said no.

650
00:37:13.239 --> 00:37:15.210
It's impossible, you know?

651
00:37:15.409 --> 00:37:17.300
People wait their whole
lives for a shot like that.

652
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:18.969
- And he's not even a pro.
- Yeah.

653
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.449
Why does it look like
you're still considering it?

654
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.230
Right. All right. Work
him against the ropes.

655
00:37:30.429 --> 00:37:32.849
Work him. Stay in front of him,
baby. Cut off that ring. Come on.

656
00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.969
Oof.

657
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.420
That's right.

658
00:37:39.289 --> 00:37:41.369
Don't look at me, man. You
on your own in there. Let's go.

659
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:42.889
Come on, mijo,stay on him.

660
00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:44.300
Keep fighting. Let's go.

661
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.949
Okay.

662
00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:49.679
Okay, baby, come on. Come on.

663
00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.829
Okay.

664
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.309
Let's go, grandpa.

665
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:54.349
Not enough.

666
00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.010
Stay focused. Jabs, jabs.

667
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.949
Give it to him.

668
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:03.789
Work yourself out
the clinch. Let's do it.

669
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.829
- Hey! You keep it clean, huh?
- What was that? Hey.

670
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:10.610
Yo, man. What you
trying to do, hurt me?

671
00:38:10.809 --> 00:38:14.139
- Walk it off. Little man, you ain't built like that.
- Who you calling "little man"?

672
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.320
This is my gym, bro.

673
00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:16.530
All right, coz. All right!

674
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.010
Get in there.

675
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:18.849
Hey, hey, hey.

676
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.579
Nah. Get back,
Damian. Let him go.

677
00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.539
Hey! What's going on down here?

678
00:38:24.739 --> 00:38:25.719
That was intentional.

679
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.889
- You handle this.
- I am gonna handle this.

680
00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:29.289
D, talk to me. What happened?

681
00:38:29.489 --> 00:38:30.369
Me doing my job.

682
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.420
Hey, come here, man.

683
00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:35.250
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.
Use your head. Okay?

684
00:38:35.449 --> 00:38:36.869
Use your head. Leave
all that other mess outside.

685
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.050
I told you what I want, D.

686
00:38:41.269 --> 00:38:42.599
And I told you it was
gonna take some time.

687
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.750
All right.

688
00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.710
All right? Go take a walk.

689
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.230
Get some air.

690
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.880
Aight?

691
00:38:51.539 --> 00:38:52.570
Hey, Adonis.

692
00:38:52.769 --> 00:38:53.960
No-- Hey, Duke. Calm down.

693
00:38:54.159 --> 00:38:55.269
- This was a mistake.
- I got it under control.

694
00:38:55.469 --> 00:38:56.530
I told you right away
it was a mistake.

695
00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:58.789
- I got it.
- You don't!

696
00:38:58.989 --> 00:39:00.800
You let him come in here
with a chip on his shoulder.

697
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.190
That's exactly...

698
00:39:02.389 --> 00:39:04.409
- Well, don't get quiet now, Dukie.
- Man...

699
00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:09.119
It's okay. Relax. I know, I got
you. I know. Just let it go. Okay?

700
00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:12.039
I got it under control.

701
00:39:13.429 --> 00:39:15.260
He's telling you
who he is, right?

702
00:39:15.949 --> 00:39:17.000
Believe him.

703
00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.409
What you up to, rascal?

704
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:33.199
Oh, I was...

705
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.670
I was cleaning.

706
00:40:36.869 --> 00:40:38.860
That's not what
Uncle Duke told me...

707
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.510
I don't want to get in trouble.

708
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.440
Mom doesn't want me to fight.

709
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.650
How 'bout it's
our little secret?

710
00:40:53.849 --> 00:40:55.130
Yes!

711
00:40:55.329 --> 00:40:57.300
Want me to show
you all the other stuff?

712
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.059
Yes!

713
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.750
That's called a straight right.

714
00:41:06.949 --> 00:41:08.889
That's how you
knocked out Wheeler?

715
00:41:09.679 --> 00:41:11.110
Who taught you that?

716
00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.159
You.

717
00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.510
You watched that fight?

718
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:21.690
I've watched all your fights.

719
00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:25.519
Show me something else.

720
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.639
Most people think it's
about violence but it's not.

721
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.380
It's timing and focus and...

722
00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:35.880
Control?

723
00:41:58.639 --> 00:42:01.150
Perfect.

724
00:42:52.739 --> 00:42:55.349
Can I get two scotches on
the rocks? All right, thank you.

725
00:42:56.389 --> 00:42:57.349
'Sup, Donnie?

726
00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:00.869
I would've had you.

727
00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:06.179
Okay, maybe not.

728
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.309
- You look all right.
- You know. You too.

729
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:13.280
- A sweater.
- I'm... just glad you came.

730
00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.349
B invited.

731
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.630
True.

732
00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.550
Hey, don't worry about them.

733
00:43:22.159 --> 00:43:23.190
I ain't.

734
00:43:23.389 --> 00:43:25.449
It's a party. Have fun.

735
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.510
So many other things in
here you should be looking at.

736
00:43:30.599 --> 00:43:32.170
It's a fire party, bro. Yeah.

737
00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:34.690
Congrats, boy.

738
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:38.380
You made it.

739
00:43:38.579 --> 00:43:40.900
Chavez, Drago.

740
00:43:41.099 --> 00:43:42.960
I'm gonna make sure
that's the fight of the year.

741
00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:45.829
Hey, you okay?

742
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.139
I don't need no
babysitting, bro.

743
00:43:50.179 --> 00:43:51.480
Aight. I'ma be right back.

744
00:43:51.679 --> 00:43:52.619
Go ahead.

745
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.050
Look at my two killers.

746
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:57.579
I can't wait to
get this thing...

747
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:02.920
Are you ready to do this?

748
00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:04.659
You know I'm always
ready. You don't have to ask.

749
00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.619
Okay. Save it for fight night.

750
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.059
We got the venue. We got the
money. We're gonna break records.

751
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.929
Will you send me
the tracks, please?

752
00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:13.409
I can't wait to hear them.

753
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:14.849
We'll talk next week. It
was so nice to meet you.

754
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:16.300
Congratulations too.

755
00:44:16.909 --> 00:44:18.210
You made it.

756
00:44:19.039 --> 00:44:20.639
- Yep.
- Thank you for coming.

757
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:21.869
You having fun?

758
00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:23.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

759
00:44:24.099 --> 00:44:25.730
- Yeah.
- Good. Me too.

760
00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.949
I'm tired of working
the room, but...

761
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.469
It's what you do.

762
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.559
Yeah, sometimes.

763
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.300
- Guess that's what y'all do.
- Look at him over there.

764
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.869
Getting his Don King on.

765
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.519
Minus the hair.

766
00:44:36.719 --> 00:44:37.960
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

767
00:44:38.159 --> 00:44:39.389
You know, that's growth for him.

768
00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.409
He used to hate
coming to these things.

769
00:44:42.539 --> 00:44:43.590
So...

770
00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:47.179
- How does it feel?
- What's that?

771
00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.489
Having somebody
else sing your song?

772
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:49.630
Mmm.

773
00:44:50.639 --> 00:44:52.409
It feels good.

774
00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:55.340
I mean, if it's gotta
be anybody, not bad.

775
00:44:56.469 --> 00:44:57.670
Yeah, I almost believe you.

776
00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:03.079
How about Donnie?
Think he misses boxing?

777
00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:05.690
No. Not that he tells me.

778
00:45:07.389 --> 00:45:08.480
But would he?

779
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.269
Speaking of, you know, there's
something I wanted to ask you actually.

780
00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:18.449
Curious what
happened with you two.

781
00:45:20.269 --> 00:45:21.480
Oh, you wanna know
how I got locked up.

782
00:45:21.679 --> 00:45:23.309
Yeah.

783
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:24.699
Boring story really.

784
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.150
Got into a fight.

785
00:45:27.539 --> 00:45:28.940
I had a few priors.

786
00:45:29.889 --> 00:45:31.019
Pulled a gun.

787
00:45:32.719 --> 00:45:34.320
Donnie was there.
He can tell you.

788
00:45:34.519 --> 00:45:35.800
You know.

789
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.250
Donnie pop off...

790
00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:42.380
And I ain't even saying
dude ain't deserve it, but...

791
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.340
Who is "dude"?

792
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.570
Okay. Uh...

793
00:45:53.219 --> 00:45:54.440
His name was Leon.

794
00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.489
The rest of it, we gonna
leave to Donnie to tell you.

795
00:45:59.309 --> 00:46:01.320
Ain't really my place. Feel me?

796
00:46:03.449 --> 00:46:04.610
But it's like you say.

797
00:46:04.809 --> 00:46:07.050
You know, it take
work to look at the past.

798
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:08.699
- Yo, stop him.
- Drago!

799
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.440
Hey, hey, get that guy!

800
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.800
The LAPD took this man,
Luis Camino, into custody...

801
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.969
No.

802
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.190
No, we're not
canceling anything.

803
00:46:23.389 --> 00:46:24.849
He's seeing a
specialist right now.

804
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:29.239
They're saying...
at least six months.

805
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.849
I know. I know. But
we'll figure it out.

806
00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:32.349
Do not move the date.

807
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.380
All right. All right. Bye.

808
00:46:34.579 --> 00:46:36.030
...high-profile event.

809
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.429
Drago, who's currently
recovering at Cedars-Sinai,

810
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:40.340
suffered a concussion,

811
00:46:40.539 --> 00:46:42.909
as well as multiple fractures
to his right arm and hand.

812
00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.480
And his injuries
now throw into doubt

813
00:46:45.679 --> 00:46:47.260
his participation
in next month's...

814
00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:49.650
...highly-anticipated
title fight

815
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:51.309
- against Felix Chavez.
- Hello?

816
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:53.050
Yes, everything
is gonna be fine.

817
00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:55.010
We'll figure it out. We'll
find another fighter.

818
00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.489
It's not about just
finding another fighter.

819
00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.010
I know, and I understand
your frustrations. I really do.

820
00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:01.010
So, what are you gonna do?

821
00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:03.280
He wants to fight Drago.

822
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.110
But we can't wait six
months for him to be cleared.

823
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:09.510
These windows don't last forever.
We need to get him paid now.

824
00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:15.460
All right, there's one, maybe two
other contenders outside of Drago.

825
00:47:15.659 --> 00:47:17.639
There's Ortiz, and
then there's Sporino.

826
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.639
And he's recovering
from his last fight.

827
00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.789
Okay, so then who?

828
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.739
I got an idea.

829
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.619
It's risky, but if we pull
it off, it'll be a payday.

830
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:35.699
What do you have in mind?

831
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:36.880
He wants you to fight Dame.

832
00:47:37.079 --> 00:47:38.699
Dame?

833
00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:40.750
He's not even a real fighter.

834
00:47:40.949 --> 00:47:43.099
He was real enough when
he was sparring with you.

835
00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.269
Hey, Felix, people talk.

836
00:47:44.469 --> 00:47:46.489
Champ, he's older than you.

837
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:48.150
- Huh?
- You're right.

838
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:51.280
But Dame will
fight tooth and nail.

839
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.110
Right now, we gotta
think outside the box.

840
00:47:55.389 --> 00:47:56.849
Oh, you don't like it, huh?

841
00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:58.590
Damian ain't a boxer.

842
00:47:58.789 --> 00:47:59.989
He's fighting the world and
he's trying to hurt people.

843
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:01.900
No, I don't like it. I
think it'd be a circus.

844
00:48:02.099 --> 00:48:05.559
What he means is he's
gonna put on a show. Okay?

845
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.559
We gotta play the
cards that we're dealt.

846
00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.170
But the thing here
is, will people come?

847
00:48:10.369 --> 00:48:13.429
Oh, people are gonna show
up. I can promise you that.

848
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:16.309
Everyone loves
an underdog story.

849
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:20.750
You know how many people tuned
in when Apollo gave Rocky a shot?

850
00:48:20.949 --> 00:48:23.110
People are still talking
about that fight today.

851
00:48:23.889 --> 00:48:25.789
Champ, listen.

852
00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:29.190
I know it's not what we
promised, okay? I understand.

853
00:48:29.389 --> 00:48:32.510
But if it was me, I'd do it.

854
00:48:35.429 --> 00:48:36.469
What do you think?

855
00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:38.949
Do you trust him?

856
00:48:39.909 --> 00:48:41.590
Yes, of course.

857
00:48:41.789 --> 00:48:43.260
Ok so let's go.

858
00:48:44.389 --> 00:48:45.570
Let's do it.

859
00:48:46.179 --> 00:48:47.559
Just let your boy know,

860
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.250
I'ma beat his ass
when I'm in that ring.

861
00:48:49.449 --> 00:48:52.920
Felix, all I want
you to do is your job.

862
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:56.010
- Hmm?
- Let's get it.

863
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.050
Since taking over the
famous Delphi Academy

864
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.449
with his longtime trainer, and
partner, "Little" Duke Burton,

865
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:11.139
Adonis Creed has
trained and mentored

866
00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.579
the next generation
of boxing legends.

867
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.190
Adonis always
looked out. We family.

868
00:49:17.389 --> 00:49:20.280
But the brightest jewel
in Creed Athletics' crown

869
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.730
is undoubtedly Felix Chavez.

870
00:49:25.519 --> 00:49:28.679
I go in there like
if I'm a warrior.

871
00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.469
And until I take you
out, I'm not gonna stop.

872
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:34.429
Me and my mother, we wanna
build a legacy, just like they did.

873
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:36.079
I had my time as a fighter.

874
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.429
Felix is the next generation.

875
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:41.389
I'm just excited I get a chance
to see the fireworks up close.

876
00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:43.389
Boy is explosive.

877
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:46.739
Now, Creed is staking
his reputation and legacy

878
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:50.050
on an unlikely new
opponent for Chavez.

879
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.880
Shit, man. Before
I got locked up,

880
00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:54.800
I was the highest-ranking
amateur in boxing.

881
00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:57.670
Ever.

882
00:49:57.869 --> 00:49:59.150
"Diamond" Damian Anderson

883
00:49:59.349 --> 00:50:01.630
was once a heralded
Golden Gloves champion

884
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:05.019
from the Crenshaw district
of Los Angeles, California.

885
00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:07.900
But after almost two
decades behind bars,

886
00:50:08.099 --> 00:50:10.860
he's only now making
his professional debut.

887
00:50:11.059 --> 00:50:14.469
It's the longest hiatus in the history
of boxing 'cause I'm back now.

888
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:17.340
The future of two fighters
hangs in the balance.

889
00:50:17.539 --> 00:50:21.739
Creed Athletics is promoting the
most surprising fight of the year.

890
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.579
Will it be a Cinderella story, or
another notch on the champion's belt?

891
00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.349
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

892
00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.750
and welcome to the
Crypto.com Arena

893
00:50:32.949 --> 00:50:36.269
for tonight's main event.

894
00:50:36.469 --> 00:50:41.280
The stars are arriving for a much
hyped and very unique title match,

895
00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.500
brought to you by Showtime
and Creed Athletics,

896
00:50:44.699 --> 00:50:48.500
between the reigning WBC
heavyweight champion, Felix Chavez,

897
00:50:48.699 --> 00:50:52.480
and the virtually unknown
challenger, Damian Anderson.

898
00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.269
- All right, let's go.
- Mm-hmm.

899
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.579
Yeah.

900
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.969
Gentlemen.

901
00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:18.150
Creed.

902
00:51:19.809 --> 00:51:21.239
- Give us a minute.
- Yeah.

903
00:51:25.769 --> 00:51:27.929
6'1",

904
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:31.599
fighting out of the Crenshaw
District of Los Angeles,

905
00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.510
"Diamond" Dame Anderson.

906
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:38.070
Oh, shit.

907
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:41.769
See they finally got
you out of those chains.

908
00:51:41.969 --> 00:51:43.119
Mmm.

909
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.139
How do I look?

910
00:51:45.699 --> 00:51:46.880
You look lighter.

911
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:53.519
Thank you.

912
00:51:53.719 --> 00:51:54.760
You ain't gotta thank me.

913
00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.929
Just go out there and put on.

914
00:51:59.929 --> 00:52:01.019
For sure.

915
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.119
And now, ladies and
gentlemen in attendance,

916
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.119
and boxing fans joining
us around the world,

917
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.769
here we go.

918
00:52:26.969 --> 00:52:30.599
The challenger this evening,
"Diamond" Damian Anderson.

919
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.739
out of South
Central Los Angeles.

920
00:52:50.909 --> 00:52:53.840
What is it about this
guy that's so special

921
00:52:54.039 --> 00:52:56.760
that he gets a title
shot his very first fight?

922
00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.980
Well, it all hinges
on Adonis Creed.

923
00:53:00.179 --> 00:53:03.159
Creed says Anderson is
more than up to the task.

924
00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.639
But we'll find out
ourselves in just a moment.

925
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.610
Will this be a fairy
tale or a massacre?

926
00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:56.340
This guy is a true
product of Creed Athletics.

927
00:53:56.539 --> 00:53:59.739
Chavez made his presence felt
when he stormed onto the scene

928
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:03.090
with a string of
devastating knockouts.

929
00:54:03.289 --> 00:54:04.920
A proud fighter,

930
00:54:05.119 --> 00:54:08.659
he had one prediction for this
evening's unlikely main event:

931
00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.269
Victory.

932
00:54:10.469 --> 00:54:12.230
From the Crypto.com Arena,

933
00:54:12.429 --> 00:54:15.670
it's time for the main
event of the evening.

934
00:54:15.869 --> 00:54:17.409
- It's showtime!
- It's okay.

935
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:19.320
I got it. Thank you.

936
00:54:19.519 --> 00:54:21.719
- Introducing to you first, on my right...
- I'm fine.

937
00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.500
...making his
professional debut,

938
00:54:23.699 --> 00:54:26.849
in an unprecedented
attempt at a world title,

939
00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:29.590
here is the former
Golden Gloves champion,

940
00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:35.289
"Diamond" Damian Anderson.

941
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:38.559
And his opponent across the ring

942
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.559
is the defending world champion.

943
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.690
With a record of 15
wins and one loss,

944
00:54:44.889 --> 00:54:48.130
he has 14 wins coming
by way of knockout.

945
00:54:48.329 --> 00:54:55.230
Introducing Felix "El
Guerrero" Chavez.

946
00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:58.579
Center ring. Center ring.

947
00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:00.840
Gentlemen, we went over
the rules in the dressing room.

948
00:55:01.039 --> 00:55:03.289
I wanna remind you to
protect yourself at all times.

949
00:55:04.679 --> 00:55:07.199
Obey my commands.

950
00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.599
God bless you both.

951
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.329
Touch up.

952
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:18.159
Dame needs to start strong.

953
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:20.119
It will be quick.

954
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.300
Because Felix is a beast.

955
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.949
Chavez! Chavez!

956
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.000
The bell and the
start of round one,

957
00:55:26.199 --> 00:55:28.349
here at the Crypto.com Arena.

958
00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:31.389
- Chavez starts out aggressive.
- On the hunt.

959
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:34.789
Sending a very clear message to
Anderson of what he has in store.

960
00:55:34.989 --> 00:55:36.960
But Anderson is
keeping a tight guard.

961
00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.110
Come on, champ! Let's go.

962
00:55:43.719 --> 00:55:46.320
Don't lay off. Keep that
pressure there, baby.

963
00:55:46.519 --> 00:55:48.409
Chavez paws with that jab there

964
00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:50.380
but Anderson's
showing good movement.

965
00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:58.780
Whoo!

966
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.119
Chavez walks him down...

967
00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.820
- Oh, wow! What an awkward punch.
- Mmm.

968
00:56:06.019 --> 00:56:07.429
That looked intentional.

969
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:08.780
Where all that power go?

970
00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.920
It ain't nothing. Let's go.

971
00:56:11.659 --> 00:56:12.780
Hands up, baby. Hands up.

972
00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.650
You ain't got nothing
I ain't seen, boy.

973
00:56:14.849 --> 00:56:16.739
Okay, grandpa. No tienes nada.

974
00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.369
You soft. You soft.

975
00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:25.750
Anderson clinches.

976
00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:28.409
Get off the ropes.

977
00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:31.110
Before shelling back
up into that crab guard.

978
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:32.630
Dame may be new to us,

979
00:56:32.829 --> 00:56:34.730
but he may have
some tricks in his bag.

980
00:56:39.469 --> 00:56:41.000
- Come on, ref. Didn't you see that?
- Box!

981
00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.469
Some dangerous
punches to end the first.

982
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:49.340
Anderson might need to
freshen up on the rule book, Al.

983
00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:50.440
Let's go, Felix.

984
00:56:52.969 --> 00:56:54.130
Son! Listen to me.

985
00:56:54.329 --> 00:56:56.039
He thinks he's got you.

986
00:56:56.239 --> 00:56:57.170
Everything's
going to be alright.

987
00:56:57.369 --> 00:56:58.389
Stick to the plan.

988
00:56:58.590 --> 00:56:59.570
- I know what I'm doing.
- Listen,

989
00:56:59.769 --> 00:57:00.829
you fight the fighter,
I fight the refs.

990
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:02.530
Don't let this turn
into no kind of brawl.

991
00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:05.360
That's what he wants. He's
trying to agitate you. No. Okay?

992
00:57:05.559 --> 00:57:07.179
- I got this.
- Let's get out there.

993
00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:08.139
You stole that round.
Don't get caught up...

994
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:09.750
- Water.
- ...in their stuff.

995
00:57:09.949 --> 00:57:11.539
It's the first round and you
got bruises on your face.

996
00:57:11.739 --> 00:57:14.280
Come on, you better than that,
champ. Stick to the script, baby.

997
00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.420
You get out there and fight the
fight that we worked so hard for.

998
00:57:21.949 --> 00:57:24.159
Round two begins,

999
00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.429
and Chavez is already
back on the attack.

1000
00:57:28.739 --> 00:57:30.340
There we go, champ.

1001
00:57:30.539 --> 00:57:32.429
Feels like Chavez
is back in the fight.

1002
00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.960
Mamma mia!

1003
00:57:42.159 --> 00:57:46.500
Anderson swinging to separate
Chavez's head from his shoulders.

1004
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:53.190
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1005
00:57:53.389 --> 00:57:55.800
- Yo! What is this?
- Wow, that looked deliberate.

1006
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.150
- You! Time!
- The ref needs

1007
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:58.980
to get control before
this gets out of hand.

1008
00:57:59.179 --> 00:58:00.889
- Can you continue?
- Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.

1009
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.980
- Stay right here.
- - The only good news for Chavez is that

1010
00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:05.329
- that cut is so far below his eye...
- Come here.

1011
00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:07.679
- ...but it's still dangerous.
- Two-point deduction. Intentional elbow.

1012
00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:08.860
It's about time, ref.

1013
00:58:09.059 --> 00:58:11.250
Two-point deduction.
Intentional elbow.

1014
00:58:11.449 --> 00:58:13.949
Listen, you keep this up and
you're gonna get yourself disqualified.

1015
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:15.340
- Do you understand?
- Right. Right.

1016
00:58:15.539 --> 00:58:16.599
Stay right there.

1017
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.599
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1018
00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.909
If anyone was wondering... Box!

1019
00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:22.480
...what kind of
fight this would be,

1020
00:58:22.679 --> 00:58:25.920
it seems like Anderson
is out to make this clear:

1021
00:58:26.119 --> 00:58:29.789
This is a fight for your life.

1022
00:58:29.989 --> 00:58:33.489
Let's hope Chavez can make
it back to his corner and adjust.

1023
00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:35.710
Big right hand to end the round

1024
00:58:35.909 --> 00:58:39.969
and Chavez sends Anderson to the
corner with something to think about.

1025
00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:41.940
Way to finish. Way
to finish strong.

1026
00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:48.170
Let me get that mouthpiece.

1027
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:55.920
Keep grinding, champ.
Round after round.

1028
00:59:01.139 --> 00:59:03.920
Hey, champ. You
good? Can you still go?

1029
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:06.039
Yeah, I'm good.

1030
00:59:06.239 --> 00:59:07.360
Okay, he's good. Let's go.

1031
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:09.889
He said he's good.

1032
00:59:12.019 --> 00:59:13.750
Listen, pain is temporary.

1033
00:59:13.949 --> 00:59:16.010
- Say it back to me. Pain is temporary.
- Pain is temporary.

1034
00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:18.530
He a bum! Okay? And
you the champ, right?

1035
00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:20.449
I'm the champ.

1036
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:21.769
Let's go, champ. Keep your
hands up. Stay off them ropes.

1037
00:59:26.079 --> 00:59:27.590
Bring it in.

1038
00:59:27.789 --> 00:59:30.199
- That's good. Let's go. Vamos.
- Come on.

1039
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.590
Two rounds down,

1040
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:34.739
but it's clearly not the
fight any of us expected.

1041
00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:36.860
Stay in it, mijo.

1042
00:59:37.059 --> 00:59:38.260
Another shot to that left arm.

1043
00:59:42.179 --> 00:59:44.650
Things are starting
to get very ugly.

1044
00:59:44.849 --> 00:59:47.039
- Chavez is in some serious trouble.
- Hands free. Stop!

1045
00:59:47.239 --> 00:59:49.000
- I gotta take her, D, okay?
- Okay.

1046
00:59:49.199 --> 00:59:50.260
We gotta go.

1047
00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:52.000
There's no such thing
as defeat. Let's go.

1048
00:59:52.199 --> 00:59:53.219
This is dangerous.

1049
00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:54.869
Anderson swinging
like a wrecking ball...

1050
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:57.050
- Move. Move!
- ...and Chavez is getting demolished.

1051
01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:10.929
Oh, what a shot by
Anderson. Down goes Chavez.

1052
01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:14.460
Chavez is not getting back up.

1053
01:00:14.659 --> 01:00:16.590
Oh, no. You don't
wanna see that.

1054
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:18.380
Chavez is down

1055
01:00:18.579 --> 01:00:20.989
- and appears to be badly hurt.
- No, no, no.

1056
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:22.820
Felix!

1057
01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:24.730
Ladies and gentlemen...

1058
01:00:24.929 --> 01:00:26.650
- ¿Que paso?
- ...our referee in charge,

1059
01:00:26.849 --> 01:00:28.860
- Russell Mora, stops the contest.
- - Call the paramedics!

1060
01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:31.349
He is the winner... Doc,
is he gonna be okay?

1061
01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:33.130
...by way of
spectacular knockout

1062
01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:37.260
and he is the new unified
heavyweight champion of the world,

1063
01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:41.219
"Diamond" Damian Anderson.

1064
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.590
'Sup, bro? 'Sup, bro?

1065
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.420
Right? What?

1066
01:01:20.409 --> 01:01:22.179
All right, Duke. We
gotta make this right.

1067
01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.349
- Whatever I can do...
- No. I told you, dawg, already.

1068
01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.309
Ain't no making nothing
right. Ain't no "Duke" nothing.

1069
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:27.920
- I can fix it.
- No!

1070
01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:29.929
You can't.

1071
01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:32.849
You stay away from the gym. You
do that. And stay away for a while.

1072
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:04.130
Hey, Ma.

1073
01:02:04.329 --> 01:02:05.659
How's Felix?

1074
01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:09.369
He's still at the hospital.

1075
01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:11.369
He's stable.

1076
01:02:13.159 --> 01:02:15.139
I figured I'd get out of there
and give him some space.

1077
01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.329
Mm-hmm.

1078
01:02:16.989 --> 01:02:18.289
May be smart.

1079
01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.039
What's all this?

1080
01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.519
They're from Damian.

1081
01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:46.179
You kept these from me?

1082
01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.059
To help you move on, yes, I did.

1083
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.329
Mama, how could you?

1084
01:02:57.199 --> 01:02:58.619
I was trying to protect you.

1085
01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.019
Protect me from what?

1086
01:03:00.219 --> 01:03:01.929
Damian was my brother.

1087
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:03.889
No, Donnie.

1088
01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:06.670
Not in that facility where
you were caged like an animal.

1089
01:03:06.869 --> 01:03:08.889
Did you think that I was
gonna let you go back to that?

1090
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.559
You made him think
I abandoned him.

1091
01:03:13.519 --> 01:03:14.900
Do you know what
we went through?

1092
01:03:15.099 --> 01:03:16.920
I know who that man
was the two of you beat up.

1093
01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.010
You know Leon?

1094
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.219
Yeah.

1095
01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:32.050
Then you know Damian had my
back before you even knew who I was.

1096
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.309
Dame treated me more
like family than your two kids

1097
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:35.440
ever did in this house.

1098
01:03:35.639 --> 01:03:37.570
And you took that away from me.

1099
01:03:37.769 --> 01:03:39.590
None of this would've
happened if it wasn't for you.

1100
01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:44.119
You're absolutely right.

1101
01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:47.820
None of it.

1102
01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:51.170
You hit hard, Donnie.

1103
01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:54.429
And you can't see.

1104
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:59.570
There may have been a time
when Damian had your back.

1105
01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.349
But that's not what
he's doing now.

1106
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:39.590
Excuse me.

1107
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:42.289
Yo, Dame. Dame.

1108
01:04:42.489 --> 01:04:44.119
- Hey, man.
- Get your hands off me.

1109
01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.949
Get your hands off me!

1110
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.909
Hold up.

1111
01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:51.269
It's aight. Cool out, bro.

1112
01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.659
Give me that.

1113
01:04:59.059 --> 01:05:00.239
That's what we on?

1114
01:05:02.059 --> 01:05:04.400
What's up, Donnie? You
all right? You look tidy, bro.

1115
01:05:04.599 --> 01:05:06.329
Man. Nah, nah, you tell me, bro.

1116
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.639
You've been playing
me this whole time.

1117
01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:12.929
Guess you did get
them letters, huh?

1118
01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:14.079
Why'd you lie to me?

1119
01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:17.760
I vouched for you.

1120
01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.989
I brought you into my home,
bro. You met my family.

1121
01:05:21.599 --> 01:05:24.199
I put money up for you.

1122
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.070
- Put the gloves on your hands like you asked.
- All right. That's enough.

1123
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:28.659
You feel me?

1124
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.090
You put the gloves on my hands?

1125
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:34.230
Oh, homey.

1126
01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:36.389
You must be punchy.

1127
01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:42.400
'Cause if memory serves,
you used to carry my gloves.

1128
01:05:42.599 --> 01:05:44.920
Get your shit and
get out the gym.

1129
01:05:45.119 --> 01:05:47.659
Oh, Donnie, hold
on. Wait, wait, wait.

1130
01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.719
You think I need you?

1131
01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:53.230
No. When I got locked
up, I needed you.

1132
01:05:53.429 --> 01:05:56.940
When I came home,
yeah, bro, I needed you.

1133
01:05:58.769 --> 01:06:00.079
But look around, bro.

1134
01:06:01.909 --> 01:06:04.199
- I'm the champ!
- Yeah!

1135
01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.199
And I don't need you for
nothing or... or nothing.

1136
01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:11.920
Who alone now?

1137
01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.909
Yeah, that's right. Run away.

1138
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:21.829
Run away. That's the
one thing you still good at,

1139
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:23.570
Baby Creed.

1140
01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:30.059
What was that?

1141
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:32.809
- What'd you call me?
- Oh, you mad?

1142
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:36.289
You mad?

1143
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.630
Try spending half
your life in a cell

1144
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.730
watching somebody
else live your life.

1145
01:06:43.769 --> 01:06:45.429
You turned your
back on me, homey.

1146
01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.000
Hey, but look, don't trip.

1147
01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:53.070
Hey, come here.

1148
01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:54.309
Remember this?

1149
01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.079
This title?

1150
01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.559
All this?

1151
01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.750
Hey, I'm just getting
started, little brother.

1152
01:07:03.179 --> 01:07:04.789
I'm coming for it all.

1153
01:07:06.099 --> 01:07:07.750
And what's that
supposed to mean?

1154
01:07:08.579 --> 01:07:09.760
Are you threatening me?

1155
01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:17.679
Ain't no threats here, bro.

1156
01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.230
Just promises here, homey.

1157
01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:24.280
Come here. Let's see.

1158
01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.769
- Get your hands off me.
- Oh, you all right.

1159
01:07:30.519 --> 01:07:31.650
Yeah.

1160
01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:33.820
Help yourself up for once.

1161
01:07:35.219 --> 01:07:36.260
See how it feel.

1162
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:54.280
Aloha!

1163
01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.289
Where were you all night?

1164
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:12.119
You didn't get any of my
calls then, or this morning?

1165
01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.770
What happened to your eye?

1166
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:19.699
Nothing.

1167
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.270
Are you okay?

1168
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.920
Not today. I ain't got
time for a therapy session.

1169
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:33.130
Okay. Well, then what
do you have time for?

1170
01:08:33.329 --> 01:08:35.569
Let me know.

1171
01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:38.090
Because I have been trying to talk
to you for a really long time, Donnie.

1172
01:08:38.289 --> 01:08:39.239
All right?

1173
01:08:41.109 --> 01:08:43.279
Please, can you tell
me what is going on.

1174
01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.750
Is it me?

1175
01:08:45.949 --> 01:08:48.579
No. It's nothing to do with you.

1176
01:08:56.859 --> 01:08:57.909
Is it about Leon?

1177
01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:02.560
What? Who told you that?

1178
01:09:04.699 --> 01:09:05.920
Dame.

1179
01:09:07.869 --> 01:09:09.750
Is there something
else you wanna tell me?

1180
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:16.609
D, you have got to
open up at some point.

1181
01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:19.130
I don't know what else to
tell you. I need to understand.

1182
01:09:19.329 --> 01:09:21.270
What do you want me to
say? What do you wanna hear?

1183
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:22.829
Some sad story?

1184
01:09:23.029 --> 01:09:24.920
You're trying to feel
sorry for me or something?

1185
01:09:25.119 --> 01:09:26.970
I don't wanna feel sorry for
you! I wanna understand you!

1186
01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:29.319
I wanna know what is going
on with you in my house!

1187
01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.229
There's nothing to talk about! I
don't wanna talk about anything!

1188
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:34.189
I've been trying to forget it!

1189
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:37.460
It's dead! Leave
it! Leave it! Let it lie!

1190
01:09:37.659 --> 01:09:39.340
I'm not talking about
that shit no more.

1191
01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.859
You figure out your shit, D.

1192
01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:56.140
Because what cannot happen
is her seeing you like this.

1193
01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:59.229
Do you understand?

1194
01:10:00.539 --> 01:10:01.840
yeah.

1195
01:10:09.199 --> 01:10:10.369
I love you.

1196
01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.420
Hey, what y'all doing in there?

1197
01:10:58.159 --> 01:11:00.279
Dame! Adonis!

1198
01:11:00.479 --> 01:11:02.149
- Stop!
- Come on! Fight me!

1199
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:03.239
Leon, I'm sorry!

1200
01:11:03.439 --> 01:11:04.689
Y'all are so tough, huh?

1201
01:11:18.439 --> 01:11:20.470
- Leon?
- Huh?

1202
01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:22.229
Don't remember me, do you?

1203
01:11:31.369 --> 01:11:33.180
Hey, get off him!

1204
01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.670
Yeah, you know
what it is, homey.

1205
01:11:42.939 --> 01:11:44.189
- Dame!
- Step away from the gun.

1206
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:45.760
- Step away from the gun.
- It's down.

1207
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:46.949
It's down! It's down.

1208
01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.729
- Hey, Mama.
- Adonis, baby.

1209
01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:00.510
You gotta get here right away.

1210
01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:02.989
Mama had another stroke.

1211
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:06.000
They're saying
multiple organ failures.

1212
01:12:06.199 --> 01:12:08.869
I don't know, D. I think it's...

1213
01:12:09.069 --> 01:12:11.060
I think it might be
time to say goodbye.

1214
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:15.060
Mama?

1215
01:12:19.329 --> 01:12:20.840
Mom, I'm sorry.

1216
01:12:21.039 --> 01:12:22.899
- What?
- I didn't mean it.

1217
01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.100
I didn't mean it.

1218
01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.420
Mm-mmm.

1219
01:12:27.899 --> 01:12:30.159
The day I met you.

1220
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:33.909
Ooh, that face.

1221
01:12:35.119 --> 01:12:39.029
Mmm. You were so mad.

1222
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:45.170
Gonna knock everybody
out, one by one.

1223
01:12:45.369 --> 01:12:46.920
Just like your father.

1224
01:12:49.489 --> 01:12:52.449
That's why he fought so
hard. You know that, right?

1225
01:12:53.449 --> 01:12:55.039
Yeah.

1226
01:12:55.239 --> 01:12:59.149
But you-- you don't
have to do that.

1227
01:12:59.979 --> 01:13:02.939
You can find another way.

1228
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:05.970
Yeah.

1229
01:13:07.819 --> 01:13:09.899
Yeah, another way.

1230
01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:12.210
Another way.

1231
01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.199
I was angry.

1232
01:13:15.399 --> 01:13:19.210
I was so angry when
you left me, Apollo.

1233
01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:27.789
Why did you leave me alone?

1234
01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.100
Adonis.

1235
01:13:34.489 --> 01:13:36.449
That's his name.

1236
01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:38.609
I'm right here.

1237
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:41.579
He saved me, Apollo.

1238
01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:47.359
He helped me to forgive you.

1239
01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.199
Mom, I'm sorry.

1240
01:13:50.939 --> 01:13:52.420
Just tell me what to do.

1241
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.729
Okay?

1242
01:13:57.819 --> 01:13:59.600
Adonis.

1243
01:14:01.689 --> 01:14:03.000
Adoni--

1244
01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:36.260
I'm sorry.

1245
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:40.140
I know.

1246
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:44.170
It's okay.

1247
01:15:44.369 --> 01:15:45.310
No, it's not.

1248
01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.970
It's just...

1249
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:50.149
when Dame came back...

1250
01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:56.890
all this shit came back too.

1251
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:59.149
I didn't know how to handle it.

1252
01:16:00.939 --> 01:16:03.020
But you were always
really good at that.

1253
01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:05.670
Feelings. It comes easy to you.

1254
01:16:05.869 --> 01:16:07.470
Doesn't come easy to me.

1255
01:16:08.899 --> 01:16:09.949
Doesn't.

1256
01:16:11.729 --> 01:16:14.680
I still got a lot of stuff
that I'm trying to figure out,

1257
01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.029
and I don't always know
how to talk about it either.

1258
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:19.770
You know, Mary-Anne
was the closest thing

1259
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:21.729
I've had to a mom
in a really long time.

1260
01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:23.350
I could talk to her.

1261
01:16:23.699 --> 01:16:25.140
Now she's gone.

1262
01:16:28.439 --> 01:16:32.829
And when I stopped performing,
it was really hard to accept

1263
01:16:33.029 --> 01:16:35.800
that my dreams didn't turn out the
way that I imagined that they would.

1264
01:16:38.539 --> 01:16:39.890
And that still hurts me.

1265
01:16:42.109 --> 01:16:43.159
A lot.

1266
01:16:45.159 --> 01:16:49.279
But I just made a
choice to try to move on

1267
01:16:49.479 --> 01:16:51.380
and be happy
about what I do have.

1268
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:58.210
But it's not easy.

1269
01:17:01.609 --> 01:17:02.909
I just try.

1270
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:19.710
Leon...

1271
01:17:21.979 --> 01:17:23.800
was the dad at the group home

1272
01:17:25.239 --> 01:17:26.460
where I lived with Dame.

1273
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:32.550
I'm not saying me
and Dame were angels.

1274
01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:36.500
Okay? But...

1275
01:17:36.699 --> 01:17:39.430
no kid deserves to
get beat on like we did.

1276
01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:41.560
You feel me?

1277
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:46.739
That night at the
liquor store, I saw Leon.

1278
01:17:50.829 --> 01:17:51.960
And I snapped.

1279
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:57.489
And I hit him.

1280
01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:01.710
I kept hitting him.

1281
01:18:05.369 --> 01:18:07.069
And his boys jumped on me.

1282
01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:10.500
So Dame pulled a gun.

1283
01:18:12.199 --> 01:18:13.250
Cops pulled up.

1284
01:18:14.729 --> 01:18:15.810
We tried to run.

1285
01:18:16.989 --> 01:18:19.640
Dame got caught. I got away.

1286
01:18:22.779 --> 01:18:24.210
I ran.

1287
01:18:25.649 --> 01:18:26.819
You were a kid.

1288
01:18:28.609 --> 01:18:32.029
You were scared.
Anybody would've run.

1289
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:35.170
And Dame had a gun,
Adonis. That's not on you.

1290
01:18:35.369 --> 01:18:37.310
Yeah, but when he went
down, I didn't reach out.

1291
01:18:39.659 --> 01:18:40.840
I never called.

1292
01:18:41.659 --> 01:18:42.750
I didn't write.

1293
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:51.460
After a while, it felt easier
to pretend like I forgot.

1294
01:18:52.329 --> 01:18:53.550
You know, just...

1295
01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.489
act like it never happened.

1296
01:18:57.689 --> 01:19:00.420
But that doesn't make you
responsible for how his life turned out.

1297
01:19:03.859 --> 01:19:06.250
You are a good man, Adonis.

1298
01:19:06.989 --> 01:19:09.380
I don't know anymore.

1299
01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:11.590
You have got to try
to forgive yourself,

1300
01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:16.130
so that you can begin to believe that
you deserve the life that you have earned.

1301
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.399
Because you do.

1302
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:23.359
Don't let him destroy
everything you've built.

1303
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.779
But, B, he's not gonna stop.

1304
01:19:26.979 --> 01:19:28.359
Then you make him.

1305
01:19:30.279 --> 01:19:32.409
There's only one way
that Dame's gonna listen.

1306
01:19:37.979 --> 01:19:39.810
If that's what you
gotta do, then...

1307
01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.630
all right.

1308
01:19:42.829 --> 01:19:45.189
At 26 and one, he's the former
heavyweight champion of the world.

1309
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:48.020
One of the greatest fighters
in the history of boxing.

1310
01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:50.460
The one and only Adonis
Creed is sitting right next to me.

1311
01:19:50.659 --> 01:19:52.029
Welcome to the show,
my man. How you doing?

1312
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:53.770
I'm doing okay, man.
Thanks for having me.

1313
01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:55.770
Yeah... ...thank
you for being here.

1314
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:58.770
You called to be on this
show, which you've never done.

1315
01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:01.689
I wanna know why
you felt the need

1316
01:20:01.890 --> 01:20:03.649
to come on national
television today to speak.

1317
01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:04.739
What's on your mind?

1318
01:20:04.939 --> 01:20:06.649
When I walked away from boxing,

1319
01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:08.779
- I walked away with some unfinished business.
- Mmm.

1320
01:20:08.979 --> 01:20:11.609
Gotta be talking about Dame.
Gotta be talking about him.

1321
01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:13.130
Let's just get this
out of the way.

1322
01:20:13.329 --> 01:20:14.399
You know I believe
you're the best

1323
01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.960
pound-for-pound
fighter in the world,

1324
01:20:16.159 --> 01:20:17.920
three years ago.

1325
01:20:18.119 --> 01:20:19.619
It's been a minute since
you've been out in these streets,

1326
01:20:19.819 --> 01:20:21.319
so maybe you haven't heard
what they've been saying about you.

1327
01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.010
Conlan.

1328
01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:24.760
He was beyond his
prime when you beat him.

1329
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.279
Dame.

1330
01:20:26.479 --> 01:20:28.670
He's the next king of
boxing. Not you. Okay?

1331
01:20:28.869 --> 01:20:31.020
Every time you turn around,

1332
01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.939
Dame is talking about you
dirty, and unapologetically.

1333
01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:34.720
Hey, turn that up.

1334
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.029
To anybody who'll listen,
he questions your manhood,

1335
01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:38.460
he talks about your family.

1336
01:20:38.659 --> 01:20:40.119
He talks about how
you can't be trusted,

1337
01:20:40.319 --> 01:20:41.640
and that you run
out on your boys.

1338
01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.210
No, no. No. Wait. Let me just...

1339
01:20:43.409 --> 01:20:45.079
Hold on. We got
a call coming in.

1340
01:20:45.279 --> 01:20:47.300
We got a call. Put
him on, right now.

1341
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.039
Hey, what up, little homey?

1342
01:20:49.239 --> 01:20:50.609
You want a tissue?

1343
01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:52.520
Want me to come on
there and give you a hug?

1344
01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.439
Aight, look, I'm just telling
everybody who you really are.

1345
01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.739
How you run out on family.

1346
01:20:56.939 --> 01:21:01.270
Dame, uh, not like this.

1347
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:02.529
This ain't the way to handle it.

1348
01:21:02.729 --> 01:21:04.800
Oh, bad news, bro. This is live.

1349
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.840
So, I mean, this how
we gonna handle it now.

1350
01:21:07.039 --> 01:21:08.710
Little Donnie ain't got
nothin'. He a coward.

1351
01:21:08.909 --> 01:21:11.539
You a coward, bro, and a fraud.

1352
01:21:11.739 --> 01:21:13.369
I know it. Everybody
else know it.

1353
01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:15.939
Hey, Apollo Creed
would be ashamed.

1354
01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:17.260
Oh, you lost it.

1355
01:21:17.729 --> 01:21:19.770
Aight.

1356
01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:22.220
I challenge you for the heavyweight
championship of the world.

1357
01:21:22.869 --> 01:21:23.680
You and me?

1358
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.420
- Run it.
- Run it!

1359
01:21:25.619 --> 01:21:27.689
Oh, hell yes. Y'all
heard it here first.

1360
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:29.300
I know I can't wait for this.

1361
01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:30.649
There you go. What's up, champ?

1362
01:21:30.850 --> 01:21:32.609
- What's going on?
- Prime time.

1363
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:35.130
The champ is here!
Y'all better turn it up.

1364
01:21:35.329 --> 01:21:36.779
Here we go, folks.

1365
01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:41.500
Let's get reacquainted.

1366
01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.930
Fractured fourth
and fifth metacarpals.

1367
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:53.890
Both hands.

1368
01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:54.800
His eye socket broke.

1369
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:55.859
Ruptured kidney.

1370
01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.550
- His shoulder don't work.
- Torn abductor.

1371
01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:01.899
He don't got it no more. He retired.
He probably won't even make weight.

1372
01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.909
And remind me, how many
concussions have you had?

1373
01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.909
You're old, and you're broken.

1374
01:22:13.109 --> 01:22:16.039
We know Dame. Dame gonna
have this damn list memorized.

1375
01:22:16.239 --> 01:22:19.699
He's willing to do anything to win, so
you gotta be prepared for everything.

1376
01:22:19.899 --> 01:22:23.439
We can't turn back the clock,
we can't hide all your flaws,

1377
01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.449
but we can make 'em strengths.

1378
01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.010
That's it. Two jabs.

1379
01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:35.449
- Come under.
- Slip.

1380
01:22:35.649 --> 01:22:36.539
One-one-two.

1381
01:22:36.739 --> 01:22:37.890
- I got you.
- Let's go, D.

1382
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:41.239
The higher you get,
the harder it gets.

1383
01:22:41.439 --> 01:22:43.850
That's life. That's this run!

1384
01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:45.460
Let's go.

1385
01:22:45.659 --> 01:22:48.420
Tug-of-war. Old-school.

1386
01:22:48.619 --> 01:22:50.470
Right here. Let's
go. Over and over.

1387
01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:51.600
Push.

1388
01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:52.960
Push!

1389
01:22:54.479 --> 01:22:56.039
What you looking
back, boy? Look forward.

1390
01:22:56.239 --> 01:22:57.689
Who slips like this?
Nobody. Bring it in.

1391
01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:59.569
Ain't nobody gonna
take it easy on him, right?

1392
01:23:00.789 --> 01:23:02.489
Come on. Focus up.

1393
01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.930
There you go.

1394
01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:13.329
There you go.

1395
01:23:15.159 --> 01:23:15.979
Come on, man.

1396
01:23:17.239 --> 01:23:18.579
Stop thinking so much, man.

1397
01:23:18.779 --> 01:23:19.989
Get your head in the game.

1398
01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:24.899
You see that man right
there? Do you remember him?

1399
01:23:26.949 --> 01:23:29.289
You gotta block out everything
and be in the moment.

1400
01:23:29.489 --> 01:23:31.989
Not the past. Not the future.

1401
01:23:32.189 --> 01:23:33.130
Right now.

1402
01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.420
Let's go. Come on.

1403
01:23:36.619 --> 01:23:37.569
Well...

1404
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:40.340
Hey.

1405
01:23:40.539 --> 01:23:42.470
- How's the...
- Nah, nah. Don't. Don't.

1406
01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:43.869
But you're good?

1407
01:23:44.069 --> 01:23:46.010
Good enough to beat you.

1408
01:23:59.159 --> 01:23:59.810
Keep your hands up.

1409
01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:02.810
Move. Move!

1410
01:24:04.069 --> 01:24:05.029
You can go home, dawg.

1411
01:24:17.829 --> 01:24:19.420
Maybe we should take a break.

1412
01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:20.569
Take a break?

1413
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:26.029
Where you goin'?

1414
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:29.859
I'm just getting started.

1415
01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:04.210
I see you, boy.

1416
01:27:08.819 --> 01:27:10.909
Whoo! We're out
here working right now!

1417
01:27:13.479 --> 01:27:15.789
Where is he? Where is he?

1418
01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:17.220
I see you.

1419
01:27:43.079 --> 01:27:45.460
Let's do it, baby! Let's go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1420
01:27:45.659 --> 01:27:47.380
There you go! There you go!

1421
01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:07.399
Let's go!

1422
01:28:14.449 --> 01:28:16.359
Welcome to Los Angeles

1423
01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.489
for one of the most highly
anticipated heavyweight bouts in years.

1424
01:28:19.689 --> 01:28:20.939
One step.

1425
01:28:22.109 --> 01:28:23.760
One punch.

1426
01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.420
One round at a time.

1427
01:28:27.989 --> 01:28:29.029
One step.

1428
01:28:30.039 --> 01:28:31.079
One punch.

1429
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:33.869
One round at a time.

1430
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:35.819
One step.

1431
01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:38.260
One punch.

1432
01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:40.920
One round at a time.

1433
01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:58.050
Creed! Creed! Creed! Creed!

1434
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:01.619
Creed! Creed! Creed!

1435
01:29:01.819 --> 01:29:05.189
Creed! Creed! Creed! Creed!

1436
01:29:10.289 --> 01:29:12.930
Whoa!

1437
01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:14.470
Yeah, boy!

1438
01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:11.819
What's up, LA?

1439
01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:25.279
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening,

1440
01:31:25.479 --> 01:31:30.000
and welcome to the
Battle of Los Angeles.

1441
01:31:31.869 --> 01:31:35.220
The fight starts now!

1442
01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:40.300
Introducing first,
the challenger.

1443
01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.520
Fighting out of the Delphi Gym

1444
01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:47.739
and proudly representing his
home of Los Angeles, California,

1445
01:31:47.939 --> 01:31:54.399
here is the former light heavyweight
and heavyweight champion of the world,

1446
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.239
Adonis Creed!

1447
01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:02.289
Creed!

1448
01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:05.720
And his opponent
across the ring,

1449
01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:11.029
he represents the Crenshaw
District of Los Angeles, California.

1450
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:14.380
Here is the former
Golden Gloves champion

1451
01:32:14.579 --> 01:32:18.949
and the reigning,
defending, undefeated

1452
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:23.430
and unified heavyweight
champion of the world,

1453
01:32:23.630 --> 01:32:27.710
"Diamond" Damian Anderson!

1454
01:32:28.359 --> 01:32:30.390
Anderson!

1455
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:32.569
Creed retired a champion,
but he's definitely the underdog.

1456
01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:34.569
Yeah, there's no doubt
Dame has the upper hand.

1457
01:32:34.770 --> 01:32:36.750
He looks to be in
phenomenal shape.

1458
01:32:36.949 --> 01:32:39.920
You both received your
instructions in your dressing room.

1459
01:32:40.119 --> 01:32:42.800
I want a good, clean fight.

1460
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.840
Obey my commands at all times.
Above all, protect yourself at all times.

1461
01:32:47.039 --> 01:32:48.289
Let's go.

1462
01:32:50.029 --> 01:32:51.729
You on your own
now, little Donnie.

1463
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.460
Go to your corners.

1464
01:32:55.659 --> 01:32:58.250
The intensity here is like
nothing I've ever seen.

1465
01:32:58.449 --> 01:33:01.420
Yeah, you can absolutely feel
the bad blood between each other

1466
01:33:01.619 --> 01:33:02.789
in this Battle of LA.

1467
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:08.470
And we're off.

1468
01:33:08.670 --> 01:33:12.479
And the big question here in round
one, how much ring rust will Adonis have?

1469
01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.520
Three years out of the game.

1470
01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:18.090
And the way Dame attacks,
this could be over early.

1471
01:33:18.289 --> 01:33:20.489
A little bit of a cautious
start early on here.

1472
01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:22.619
Still not clear yet who's
going to be the one dictating.

1473
01:33:22.819 --> 01:33:23.840
Stop holding back, D.

1474
01:33:24.039 --> 01:33:25.500
You're giving him
too much respect.

1475
01:33:28.989 --> 01:33:32.670
Anderson gets first blood with
a nasty shot to the arm of Creed.

1476
01:33:32.869 --> 01:33:34.850
Both fighters sizing
each other up.

1477
01:33:35.050 --> 01:33:38.979
And, boom, a stiff jab to the face
lands, and Creed is gonna tie him up.

1478
01:33:43.739 --> 01:33:45.289
Keep those hands up! Let's go!

1479
01:33:45.489 --> 01:33:47.029
You gotta commit,
D! Gotta commit!

1480
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:48.399
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1481
01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:02.800
Come on, D!

1482
01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:08.100
I'd give that round to Anderson
with an impressive start here.

1483
01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:10.449
All right, little Donnie.
I'll see you in a minute.

1484
01:34:10.649 --> 01:34:12.199
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

1485
01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:15.449
Way to hang out
there. Wear him out.

1486
01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:18.109
Look, the boy a punk.
He see you not scared.

1487
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:19.939
Now it's time for him to
start fighting dirty, right?

1488
01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:21.850
Keep your head on tight.
Let him make mistakes.

1489
01:34:22.050 --> 01:34:23.289
He gonna make a
lot of them, all right?

1490
01:34:23.489 --> 01:34:25.600
And attack those
windows when they open.

1491
01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.470
You throwing power
punches, champ.

1492
01:34:27.670 --> 01:34:29.340
- Pace yourself.
- - I know what I'm doing.

1493
01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:30.640
Don't worry about me.

1494
01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.560
All that money can't
save him. Believe that.

1495
01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.689
You gotta wonder
if Creed's regretting

1496
01:34:34.890 --> 01:34:36.560
his decision to
get back in the ring.

1497
01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.829
Retirement sure seems
like it would be a lot more fun.

1498
01:34:41.069 --> 01:34:44.439
Round two underway here
in Los Angeles, live on DAZN.

1499
01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:47.010
Let's see if Adonis can
find his championship form

1500
01:34:47.210 --> 01:34:48.760
and make a fight out of this.

1501
01:34:55.199 --> 01:34:56.510
Stop running, Donnie.

1502
01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:02.079
Yes!

1503
01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:06.680
Yo, keep 'em up.

1504
01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.390
What I tell you,
huh? Here he comes.

1505
01:35:13.699 --> 01:35:15.649
- Come on, ref.
- Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up.

1506
01:35:15.850 --> 01:35:17.829
That cheap shit all you got, old
man? Can't beat me heads up?

1507
01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:35.029
You had enough, boy?

1508
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:40.810
Tie him up, baby. Tie him up.

1509
01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.819
You thought this shit
was gonna be easy.

1510
01:35:58.050 --> 01:36:00.989
What an exciting close to
round two in the battle of LA.

1511
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:03.529
Both men giving us
some tremendous blows.

1512
01:36:04.529 --> 01:36:05.829
That was better.

1513
01:36:06.029 --> 01:36:08.090
Stay focused. You take
him where you need to go.

1514
01:36:08.289 --> 01:36:10.220
Keep punching through.
Leave him open...

1515
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:15.100
Don't let this
chump control you.

1516
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:37.149
What did we just witness?

1517
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:40.239
An incredible end to round 11.

1518
01:38:40.439 --> 01:38:42.029
This fight feels dead even.

1519
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:43.939
You can feel the tension.

1520
01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:46.550
This is history
spilling into the ring.

1521
01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:48.439
What an emotionally draining
war here in Los Angeles.

1522
01:38:51.479 --> 01:38:52.529
Listen...

1523
01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:56.779
You out there boxing.

1524
01:38:56.979 --> 01:38:59.390
I need you to start fighting.

1525
01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:00.869
Go out there and do
what we came to do.

1526
01:39:01.069 --> 01:39:02.350
It's your time, champ!

1527
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:03.609
It's your time to shine!

1528
01:39:03.810 --> 01:39:06.750
Let go of the fear. You hear me?

1529
01:39:06.949 --> 01:39:08.239
Let go of the guilt.

1530
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:11.180
Let go of it, dawg.

1531
01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:15.579
Let go of whatever was
and walk into what is.

1532
01:39:15.779 --> 01:39:17.970
Go out there and be
ferocious! Do you hear me?

1533
01:39:18.170 --> 01:39:19.239
Be ferocious!

1534
01:39:19.439 --> 01:39:21.409
Go out there and
be Adonis Creed!

1535
01:39:33.130 --> 01:39:35.859
And we're off in round 12.

1536
01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:38.699
Three minutes to decide the
heavyweight championship of the world.

1537
01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:44.970
Mm-hmm.

1538
01:39:49.930 --> 01:39:51.409
Yeah, baby. Stay
in that zone with him.

1539
01:39:58.289 --> 01:39:59.770
Come on, ref!

1540
01:40:04.770 --> 01:40:06.300
There you go,
baby. There you go.

1541
01:40:20.829 --> 01:40:22.300
And Creed's down!

1542
01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:23.819
- Neutral corner.
- Get up, Donnie!

1543
01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:25.260
A massive body shot... Four!

1544
01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:26.579
...and he's down on a knee!

1545
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:31.359
- Five!
- Get up, boy!

1546
01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:34.930
Six!

1547
01:40:37.409 --> 01:40:38.720
- Get up, boy.
- Seven!

1548
01:40:44.119 --> 01:40:45.159
Eight!

1549
01:40:49.079 --> 01:40:50.119
Get up, D.

1550
01:40:53.039 --> 01:40:53.819
Nine!

1551
01:40:55.039 --> 01:40:55.819
And he's up!

1552
01:40:57.039 --> 01:40:58.770
- Come to me. You all right?
- Yeah.

1553
01:40:58.970 --> 01:40:59.949
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1554
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:01.029
- Wanna continue?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1555
01:41:01.229 --> 01:41:02.770
There you go! Yes!

1556
01:41:02.970 --> 01:41:04.989
Creed beats the count,
but here comes Dame.

1557
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:06.439
Can he survive?

1558
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:11.840
Let's go! Give it to him!

1559
01:41:20.850 --> 01:41:21.630
Break, break!

1560
01:41:23.369 --> 01:41:25.100
Creed breaks the clinch.

1561
01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:26.970
He fires everything he's got!

1562
01:41:27.170 --> 01:41:29.189
- That's it, D.
- Walking Anderson down!

1563
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:30.819
It's your time, D!
This is your time!

1564
01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:55.390
Anderson is down!
Anderson is down!

1565
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:57.890
Yeah! Like that! How about that?

1566
01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:01.529
Whoa! Lights out! What a shot!

1567
01:42:01.729 --> 01:42:05.149
Adonis Creed is the new
heavyweight champion of the world!

1568
01:42:10.199 --> 01:42:13.369
Ladies and gentlemen,
this contest comes to an end

1569
01:42:13.569 --> 01:42:18.069
at two minutes and 12 seconds
of the 12th and final round,

1570
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:20.770
for your winner by knockout.

1571
01:42:20.970 --> 01:42:23.199
The fighting pride
of Los Angeles,

1572
01:42:23.399 --> 01:42:27.770
and once again the heavyweight
champion of the world,

1573
01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:31.880
Adonis Creed!

1574
01:42:46.670 --> 01:42:49.010
Adonis Creed has done it. Yeah!

1575
01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:50.619
- A knockout...
- That's what I'm talking about.

1576
01:42:50.819 --> 01:42:53.100
...in the 12th round.
An incredible scene.

1577
01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:55.229
Yeah!

1578
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:57.319
If there was ever a question
of who is the king of boxing,

1579
01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.109
let there be no doubt.

1580
01:42:59.310 --> 01:43:01.819
The Creed dynasty
reigns supreme.

1581
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:13.909
Good. Back training hard,
back getting back focused.

1582
01:43:14.109 --> 01:43:14.880
Back for the next phase.

1583
01:43:15.789 --> 01:43:17.270
We're back in business.

1584
01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:44.039
We'll be in the hall, champ.

1585
01:44:15.279 --> 01:44:17.850
Guess you did learn a
few moves without me.

1586
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:35.430
Dame, I'm sorry.

1587
01:44:38.439 --> 01:44:39.789
All those years...

1588
01:44:42.829 --> 01:44:44.010
I never checked up on you.

1589
01:44:47.010 --> 01:44:48.010
That's on me.

1590
01:45:00.239 --> 01:45:01.289
We were just...

1591
01:45:04.329 --> 01:45:05.329
kids, bro.

1592
01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:14.600
It ain't on you.

1593
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:24.270
None of it.

1594
01:45:29.449 --> 01:45:30.750
Never was.

1595
01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:34.840
Hey, D.

1596
01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:39.630
It wasn't on you either.

1597
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:06.659
Aight, go ahead then, man.

1598
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:11.100
Family and everybody
waiting on you.

1599
01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:13.880
Champ.

1600
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:27.979
You know where to
find me if you need me.

1601
01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:54.300
You know she's been
waiting all night for this, right?

1602
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:57.180
She looks good in there.

1603
01:46:58.140 --> 01:46:59.970
Yeah.

1604
01:47:03.710 --> 01:47:04.840
- Hmm?
- You all right?

1605
01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:07.369
I'm better now.

1606
01:47:21.729 --> 01:47:23.460
Okay.

1607
01:47:23.659 --> 01:47:25.560
All right. All right, all right.

1608
01:47:28.739 --> 01:47:31.000
Ready?

1609
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.300
Ow! Ooh.

1610
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.529
- Knock him out.
- Ooh!

1611
01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:45.579
Yeah.

1612
01:47:47.970 --> 01:47:49.189
No!

1613
01:48:02.609 --> 01:48:04.770
Now we have a new champ!

1614
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:08.210
I'm the champ!

1615
01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:12.260
She's the champ!
She's the champ!

1616
01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:19.340
Home?

1617
01:48:19.539 --> 01:48:20.090
Mm-hmm.

1618
01:48:22.439 --> 01:48:23.529
Yeah.
