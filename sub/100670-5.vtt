00:08.400 --> 00:11.254
Oksana Astankova, or as
she prefers to be called...

00:11.255 --> 00:12.489
Villanelle.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.579
- You call me Villanelle.
- Her mother was dead.

00:14.580 --> 00:18.139
- Her father was a drunk.
- You choose your family over me?

00:18.140 --> 00:20.400
That's what families are.
It's what they do.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.499
I wouldn't know. Mine are all dead.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.649
Most of them, sure.

00:23.650 --> 00:26.105
What do you mean, "Most of them"?

00:26.106 --> 00:27.869
What kind of baby do you think I was?

00:27.870 --> 00:29.232
I've seen a photo of you.

00:29.233 --> 00:31.677
You had a strange head. Unnatural.

00:31.678 --> 00:34.520
I got what you ask for. Your family.

04:28.780 --> 04:29.790
Who are you?

04:31.474 --> 04:32.915
Do you speak English?

04:32.916 --> 04:35.219
Elton John is English.

04:35.220 --> 04:36.270
Yeah.

04:36.279 --> 04:38.157
He is.

04:40.918 --> 04:42.319
Do you live here?

04:42.320 --> 04:44.039
This is a nice home.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.168
Are you from Pinner?

04:46.440 --> 04:48.330
- No.
- Watford?

04:48.331 --> 04:49.560
No!

04:58.061 --> 04:59.982
- Yula?
- Shh.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.069
Who's that?

05:08.070 --> 05:10.192
- Fedya's girlfriend.
- Who's Fedya?

05:10.193 --> 05:11.634
My brother. Half-brother.

05:13.716 --> 05:15.157
Who are you?

05:15.158 --> 05:17.841
- She speaks English.
- Yeah.

05:36.940 --> 05:37.949
Who are you?

05:37.950 --> 05:40.430
Dad, you have to speak English.

05:40.438 --> 05:43.997
Why you come all way
from England to Grizmet?

05:43.998 --> 05:45.547
You have wrong house.

05:45.548 --> 05:47.870
Does Pyotr live here?

05:55.840 --> 05:57.400
Who the hell are you?

06:04.200 --> 06:06.559
- Svoloch.
- Tvoyu mat...

06:06.560 --> 06:07.859
You two are great together.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.718
That won't be necessary.

06:13.719 --> 06:17.659
It necessary if you don't
want to say who you are.

06:17.660 --> 06:18.940
Ask Pyotr.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.957
Oksana?

06:34.958 --> 06:36.519
So, you know who she is?

06:36.520 --> 06:38.069
Eta moya sestra.

06:40.350 --> 06:41.717
Ya znayu.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.239
You look just like Grandma.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.557
What do you think Elton would
eat when he's in Berlin?

06:55.558 --> 06:57.037
Uh...

06:57.038 --> 06:59.459
currywurst, with paprika.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.940
- Istanbul?
- Uh, kebab.

07:01.950 --> 07:04.387
- Go to Lezzet's. Ask for Ayaz.
- Vienna.

07:04.388 --> 07:06.729
Great ice-cream in Vienna.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.639
Athens?

07:23.640 --> 07:25.340
Taramasalata.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.020
You've been to every
city Elton's played in!

07:35.260 --> 07:37.160
- Who's that?
- Mum.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.864
I'm saving up for London
to see his farewell tour.

07:41.865 --> 07:45.280
But I'm nowhere near 50,000 roubles.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.239
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:54.240 --> 07:55.310
Where are you going?

07:55.318 --> 07:57.359
- Oksana. Oksana. Oksana.
- Agh!

07:57.360 --> 07:58.379
Oksana!

08:03.100 --> 08:04.719
Oksana, uspoykoysya.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.040
Oksana?

09:26.130 --> 09:28.179
They told me you died in fire.

09:28.180 --> 09:32.199
The orphanage phone me and
say... you burn place down.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.199
It was one floor.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.399
Two at most.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.181
- And many people die.
- 'Many' is a very loose term.

09:38.182 --> 09:41.979
And you die with them.
This is what they tell us.

09:41.980 --> 09:46.348
Sestra, I found it. Was at back of loft.

09:50.530 --> 09:52.319
Why didn't you leave him?

09:52.320 --> 09:54.079
Where?

09:54.080 --> 09:55.439
All he did was cry.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.680
I thought I'd come back
for you after one month.

10:14.690 --> 10:17.079
- Is that me?
- Mm.

10:19.900 --> 10:23.139
My head really was bulbous.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.539
You were beautiful baby.

10:25.540 --> 10:30.179
Everyone would stop me in street
and say, "She's beautiful baby."

10:30.180 --> 10:34.080
Head was big, but beautiful.

10:38.940 --> 10:40.599
Oh, yeah.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.069
I used to like dressing up

10:42.070 --> 10:44.039
and you always wanted my clothes,

10:44.040 --> 10:47.479
so I would make costume
from old curtains for you.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.199
Here.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.599
I look ridiculous.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.919
Oh. That's me.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.320
Where is Dad?

11:01.540 --> 11:04.799
There has to be one
of him before he died.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.599
I make tea.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.730
You still like Kopveska?

11:11.550 --> 11:14.620
Hmm? I bring for you.

11:18.481 --> 11:22.019
She gets sad if anyone speak of Dad.

11:22.020 --> 11:23.899
Oh!

11:23.900 --> 11:26.599
Look, Oksana. You punching me in face.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.694
That's a good punch.

11:38.970 --> 11:41.379
You have all that innocent look.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.099
Because I am innocent.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.419
I believe her.

11:44.420 --> 11:47.620
Bor'ka, speaking good English
doesn't make innocent.

11:47.630 --> 11:50.872
I know a killer when I see
a killer, and she's a killer.

11:50.873 --> 11:54.276
Are you seriously accusing her?

11:54.277 --> 11:55.438
Yes.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.440
Ooh!

11:58.441 --> 12:01.259
I can't believe it!

12:01.260 --> 12:02.599
So, who killed me?

12:04.046 --> 12:06.419
- I told you. I was right.
- But who killed me?

12:06.420 --> 12:10.039
Okay, okay. So, Oksana is not killer,

12:10.040 --> 12:12.760
but we ask now who is.

12:12.770 --> 12:14.050
Hmm.

12:18.010 --> 12:19.622
Oh!

12:19.630 --> 12:21.863
You? You?

12:21.864 --> 12:23.799
- I got the card.
- Mum, you murdered me!

12:23.800 --> 12:25.299
I had no choice, Bor'ka.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.719
You could have murdered the others.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.749
I knew it was her. I knew.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.513
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nu ladna.
- I did. I did.

12:30.514 --> 12:32.519
Why I'm so bad at this game?

12:32.520 --> 12:34.560
Pyotr, you are too naive.

12:34.570 --> 12:35.638
He means you're idiot.

12:35.639 --> 12:37.559
You were wrong too.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.402
He is, uh, like little puppy dog.

12:40.403 --> 12:42.249
You know, he lives in the barn.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.940
I like to sleep there some nights.

12:43.950 --> 12:46.779
There's a hole in the
roof and I can see stars.

12:46.780 --> 12:49.689
There is hole in roof and...
he can see stars.

12:49.690 --> 12:51.219
- Screw you.
- Screw you.

12:54.697 --> 12:56.979
Na.

12:56.980 --> 13:00.159
Oh, yes, sit down, mummy's boy, yeah.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.859
- Is good...
- Fyodor!

13:01.860 --> 13:03.039
Enough!

13:03.040 --> 13:04.059
Izini, Papa.

13:04.060 --> 13:05.659
Good.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.390
I like to make speech.

13:10.380 --> 13:13.519
This night is very, very special for me.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.710
My girl...

13:14.717 --> 13:17.600
... my little girl.

13:18.770 --> 13:20.402
Welcome home, Oksana.

13:20.403 --> 13:22.764
I've never actually lived here.

13:22.765 --> 13:24.886
- Welcome home.
- Welcome.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.168
I'll go along with it for
the sake of the moment.

15:25.327 --> 15:27.209
Anger problem.

15:28.070 --> 15:29.972
Wow.

15:31.380 --> 15:34.599
You saw this wood all day like that?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.417
It's not so bad, uh...

15:36.418 --> 15:39.263
- I used to do woodwork.
- Really?

15:39.264 --> 15:41.422
Where?

15:41.423 --> 15:44.499
You always wanted to be a firefighter.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.539
Right?

15:45.540 --> 15:48.719
You remember.

15:48.720 --> 15:53.500
Yeah, that was before I realise
I'm scared of heights.

15:54.356 --> 15:56.440
So, you've had a good life, huh?

15:58.280 --> 15:59.762
What makes you say that?

15:59.770 --> 16:03.659
Mm, Bor'ka say you've
been all over world.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.599
Is that why you became pilot?

16:05.600 --> 16:08.080
So you could travel?

16:12.140 --> 16:13.480
Sure.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.583
I missed you.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.120
You really don't remember Dad?

16:30.780 --> 16:32.670
What was he like?

16:33.680 --> 16:35.220
Funny.

16:37.070 --> 16:38.669
Strong.

16:38.670 --> 16:40.760
Taught me how to fight.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.499
He was much better.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.080
Than what?

16:50.480 --> 16:53.779
- She was mean.
- You were mean.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.540
You were annoying.

16:57.020 --> 16:58.539
I beat the crap out of sofa

16:58.540 --> 17:00.520
so I don't beat the crap out of people.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.746
You think that's weird?

17:07.599 --> 17:09.640
Just beat the crap out of people.

17:11.599 --> 17:14.589
It will make you feel a lot better.

17:14.589 --> 17:17.230
Did you think we were dead too?

17:20.760 --> 17:23.310
That's what orphanage told you.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.140
How they say we die?

17:33.320 --> 17:34.709
Car crash.

17:51.600 --> 17:55.400
This is the greatest
golubtsi you ever tasted.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.439
What are they doing over there?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.079
Annual festival tomorrow.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.989
We host for the local villagers.

18:03.990 --> 18:04.999
It's so great.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.524
You'll have lots of fun, I promise.

18:06.525 --> 18:07.675
You can't promise that.

18:07.676 --> 18:09.679
Everyone have fun at
festival. You'll see.

18:09.680 --> 18:10.720
Don't you want to get out?

18:12.480 --> 18:13.610
Mum needs me.

18:13.616 --> 18:16.137
- For what?
- I'm not like you.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.009
You were always strong.

18:18.010 --> 18:19.781
Being strong is a choice.

18:19.782 --> 18:21.669
Don't stay here for her.

18:21.670 --> 18:23.389
She wants to control you.

18:23.390 --> 18:25.186
She's not a bad woman.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.179
People here say she's saint.

18:27.180 --> 18:30.352
People here don't know her.

18:31.580 --> 18:33.280
Why did you come, Oksana?

18:35.180 --> 18:36.860
'Cause I had the hiccups.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.679
What are you doing?

18:54.680 --> 18:56.200
Having a moment.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.700
Look, it's me and sister having lunch.

19:04.770 --> 19:05.819
Uh...

19:10.170 --> 19:13.459
Nadege has been cooking
for me since I was a kid.

19:17.980 --> 19:20.479
Nadege enters her piroshki every year

19:20.480 --> 19:21.760
and has won the last...

19:21.764 --> 19:23.479
19 years.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.489
Wow.

19:24.490 --> 19:27.649
You know Bor'ka is entering
a piroshki this year?

19:27.650 --> 19:29.379
He wants the prize money.

19:29.380 --> 19:31.569
I'm terrified.

19:31.570 --> 19:34.620
And I am going to help him.

19:34.630 --> 19:37.160
But you are shit at cooking.

19:37.170 --> 19:40.160
I know, but he needs help.

19:40.170 --> 19:43.399
Are you weird arsehole like him?

19:43.400 --> 19:44.625
Weirder.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.499
Bozhe moy...

20:00.850 --> 20:04.445
Armstrong said moving
in the lunar gravity

20:04.446 --> 20:07.020
was easier than the simulations.

20:07.930 --> 20:09.479
And once Aldrin joined Armstrong...

20:09.480 --> 20:10.720
You see this?

20:11.646 --> 20:14.689
Giant leap for mankind was in Nevada.

20:14.690 --> 20:16.769
They're trying to fool us, you know?

20:16.770 --> 20:18.619
- Who?
- Them.

20:18.620 --> 20:19.899
All of them.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.459
They never even went to space.

20:21.460 --> 20:24.239
You know why? 'Cause they
don't want us to know

20:24.240 --> 20:25.779
that the earth is flat.

20:25.780 --> 20:27.379
Ha!

20:27.380 --> 20:29.309
Ha-ha-ha!

20:29.310 --> 20:31.069
... while working...

20:31.070 --> 20:32.469
You serious?

20:32.470 --> 20:33.909
Do you think this funny?

20:35.470 --> 20:37.589
There is secret organization

20:37.590 --> 20:41.320
that make influence on
every government in world.

20:41.330 --> 20:44.959
And they will cause downfall
of planet and you won't laugh.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.259
And you know that in every, um...

20:49.570 --> 20:53.199
... the intelligence agency, yes?

20:53.200 --> 20:56.299
- Yeah.
- FSB. DGSE. MI6.

20:56.300 --> 20:59.379
All have people working
for this organization.

20:59.380 --> 21:02.519
And you know what they are?

21:02.520 --> 21:04.560
Lizards.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.219
This man in England, David Icke.

21:08.220 --> 21:09.859
- You know David Icke?
- Of course.

21:09.860 --> 21:11.859
- Very smart man.
- Very.

21:11.860 --> 21:14.829
- Knows many things.
- See?

21:14.830 --> 21:16.549
We blow your mind.

21:16.550 --> 21:20.320
... the United States
and the United Nations.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.600
These lunar samples...

21:35.610 --> 21:40.820
Glupyy! Glupyy! Glupyy! Glupyy!

22:00.960 --> 22:03.719
How many grams is an ounce?

22:04.960 --> 22:06.480
28.35.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.419
Hmm.

22:08.420 --> 22:10.160
And what the hell do I do with that?

22:13.250 --> 22:15.890
That looks like shit.

22:15.900 --> 22:18.120
- I'm screwed.
- You totally are.

22:42.300 --> 22:43.400
Wow.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.849
How many times have you been married?

22:56.850 --> 22:58.259
Three.

22:58.260 --> 22:59.459
Three?

22:59.460 --> 23:01.299
Yeah.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.106
Which one was your favourite?

23:07.500 --> 23:09.859
Come on.

23:09.860 --> 23:11.789
You must have liked one the most.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.160
Tatiana is my wife now.

23:14.170 --> 23:17.480
- I love her.
- She never used to be like this.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.639
She was different.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.079
It sounds like you were different too.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.640
Mm!

23:24.650 --> 23:26.439
So, she told you about me?

23:26.440 --> 23:28.170
Yes.

23:29.560 --> 23:31.279
What did she say?

23:31.280 --> 23:33.820
She said...

23:33.830 --> 23:35.889
she had a daughter who die.

23:35.890 --> 23:39.259
She was very sad about you.

23:39.260 --> 23:41.480
If that is what you want to know.

23:42.500 --> 23:45.779
What did she say I was like?

23:45.780 --> 23:48.640
She said you were difficult child.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.059
Did she tell you she dumped me?

23:53.060 --> 23:54.349
Yeah.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.479
It was very hard time for her.

23:56.480 --> 24:00.179
You know how many things
she had to deal with.

24:00.180 --> 24:03.239
She still doesn't tell me everything.

24:03.240 --> 24:07.680
But she... cries every night.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.772
She had a...

24:12.080 --> 24:14.740
... sadness in her heart.

24:18.120 --> 24:22.040
Maybe she feels like dirt for
letting her family down.

24:25.180 --> 24:26.619
I brought you tea.

24:26.620 --> 24:28.519
Hey.

24:30.270 --> 24:32.820
Spasiba, moya dorogaya.

24:35.660 --> 24:38.240
I have something for you.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.869
It was mine from '80s.

24:47.870 --> 24:49.251
I adjust for your size.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.840
I think I got size right.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.670
You like it?

25:16.910 --> 25:18.470
I love it.

25:50.830 --> 25:52.340
Spasiba.

26:01.790 --> 26:04.960
Mm-hm. Spasiba.

26:52.374 --> 26:53.375
Vali otsyuda!

27:07.980 --> 27:10.899
Tan', ya tebe zvyaku, da?

27:30.580 --> 27:32.009
... Nadege!

28:12.590 --> 28:14.879
This place is wonderful.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.983
Is this your dance group?

28:21.984 --> 28:23.859
Performance troupe.

28:23.860 --> 28:26.699
- And we're called All Around.
- Mm.

28:26.700 --> 28:30.819
Is that because you all get around?

29:10.470 --> 29:11.589
Yes!

29:41.623 --> 29:43.919
Whoo-hoo!

30:15.910 --> 30:17.560
You don't want to dance?

30:17.570 --> 30:20.379
I am bad at dancing.

30:20.380 --> 30:21.680
Me too.

30:23.230 --> 30:25.859
Pyotr was right.

30:27.028 --> 30:28.550
This is fun.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.060
Don't do that.

30:35.070 --> 30:37.960
I should never have entered.

30:39.780 --> 30:41.959
Elton John isn't going anywhere.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.599
It's his farewell tour.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.420
Watch it on YouTube.

30:47.710 --> 30:49.179
It's really not a big deal.

30:49.180 --> 30:52.009
- I embarrassed family.
- Don't be silly.

30:52.010 --> 30:54.700
I did. Mum said I did.

30:55.590 --> 30:58.059
- When?
- After I lost.

30:58.060 --> 31:00.259
She came up to me and
said I was stupid and...

31:00.260 --> 31:01.579
... and embarrassed her and...

31:06.470 --> 31:08.990
You are freaking me out.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.819
Eat this.

31:15.820 --> 31:17.030
Be quiet.

32:05.286 --> 32:07.060
Oksana?

32:11.252 --> 32:12.279
Oksana?

32:32.420 --> 32:34.249
Come on.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.189
That used to make you laugh.

32:36.190 --> 32:37.589
No, it didn't.

32:37.590 --> 32:40.199
Okay, then. Dad laughed.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.162
- I remember someone...
- He didn't.

32:42.163 --> 32:43.439
You are wasting food.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.986
- It's tomato paste.
- You are wasting our food.

32:45.987 --> 32:48.560
I could buy 10,000 tomatoes.

32:48.570 --> 32:50.929
Am I supposed to be impressed by that?

32:50.930 --> 32:53.655
20,000.

32:55.977 --> 32:59.019
You always laugh at
things that aren't funny.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.499
Like you?

33:00.500 --> 33:02.340
Yes.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.740
Clean your face.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.315
Can you do it?

33:15.316 --> 33:17.719
You're not a child.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.500
I want to feel like one.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.860
Please.

33:27.140 --> 33:28.680
Can you do it?

34:02.860 --> 34:05.000
I want you to leave the house.

34:05.980 --> 34:07.839
No.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.960
- No.
- You leave tomorrow.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.134
I don't want you to be here anymore.

34:14.380 --> 34:15.889
Why?

34:18.630 --> 34:21.480
- This is my home.
- No, darling.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.800
You're not a part of this family.

34:30.792 --> 34:32.560
You do not belong here.

34:44.900 --> 34:47.359
What are you going to do?

34:47.360 --> 34:49.840
Take me to the orphanage?

34:52.260 --> 34:55.579
Easier to carry a trusting
little girl out of this house

34:55.580 --> 34:57.260
than it will be to carry me.

34:58.870 --> 35:01.019
Especially after the last two days.

35:01.020 --> 35:02.463
Don't pretend you were an angel.

35:02.470 --> 35:04.700
Don't pretend that you were a mother.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.699
Or a wife.

35:07.700 --> 35:08.840
Oh!

35:08.850 --> 35:12.750
You'll not bring your
darkness into this house.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.280
You are the darkness.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.100
You have always been the darkness.

35:31.572 --> 35:34.740
He wasn't scared of me.

35:36.380 --> 35:38.769
He was sick of you.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.919
He knew I could see what you are.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.422
What's that?

35:42.423 --> 35:44.779
Like me.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.600
I have killed a lot of people.

35:57.118 --> 35:59.200
I was not a happy person.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.560
You were never a happy person.

36:02.563 --> 36:04.289
That's not true.

36:04.290 --> 36:07.139
Again.

36:07.140 --> 36:09.099
That's not funny.

36:09.100 --> 36:11.611
You were bad from the beginning.

36:11.612 --> 36:13.214
You didn't cry as a baby.

36:13.215 --> 36:15.020
Please.

36:16.800 --> 36:21.119
Some bullshit myth to
make you feel better.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.224
I did cry.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.239
I did cry!

36:26.240 --> 36:28.709
You ruined me.

36:28.710 --> 36:32.169
You took everything from me.

36:32.170 --> 36:34.719
You took him.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.169
You could control him.

36:37.170 --> 36:41.919
He would do anything for you
because you had a darkness!

36:41.920 --> 36:45.000
This dar... darkness!

36:55.720 --> 36:59.039
He thought you would do something to us.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.380
To me.

37:10.100 --> 37:12.840
I didn't mind that you took me there.

37:14.620 --> 37:19.240
I didn't mind that you
never came back for me.

37:22.820 --> 37:24.500
What I mind...

37:28.220 --> 37:30.291
... is that you won't
admit what you are.

37:34.455 --> 37:37.200
That I am my mother's daughter.

37:39.660 --> 37:43.180
Get out of my house.

37:55.070 --> 37:57.038
I...

38:01.900 --> 38:03.580
I j...

38:08.860 --> 38:13.100
I think I need to kill you... Mama.
