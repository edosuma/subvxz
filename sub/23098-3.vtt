00:05.240 --> 00:07.529
Our world is not always the same.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.540
Hidden from our view,
lies a different world.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.620
Creatures utterly unlike us.

00:16.740 --> 00:18.420
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

00:18.675 --> 00:19.940
Almost alien.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.440
Yet, they are more numerous
than any other group on the planet.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.920
Welcome to the fascinating
world of the arthropods.

00:35.140 --> 00:39.860
Spiders, scorpions, and insects.

00:40.380 --> 00:44.100
Today, we have new camera
techniques that will allow us

00:44.220 --> 00:48.540
to reveal in greater detail,
than ever before, their lives -

00:48.960 --> 00:53.120
the way they fight, and feed,
and reproduce.

00:53.240 --> 00:57.000
This series uses specially
developed 3D camera technology

00:57.620 --> 01:01.100
to study the micro world in
extraordinary detail,

01:01.420 --> 01:05.220
both on location and in specially
constructed environments.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.460
We'll witness their births,
the challenges they face,

01:09.480 --> 01:12.040
and the moments when their lives
hang in the balance.

01:13.580 --> 01:17.099
And that may help us
understand how it is that, today,

01:17.460 --> 01:23.460
over 80% of all animal species
on this planet are arthropods.

01:24.620 --> 01:27.380
In this series,
we'll see the way they have evolved,

01:28.000 --> 01:32.320
from the comparative
simplicity of the millipede, to vast

01:32.440 --> 01:36.320
colonies that contain hundreds,
even millions, of individuals.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.320
We'll witness the most
extraordinary

01:40.440 --> 01:42.480
transformations in
the animal kingdom.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.680
We'll meet ants that farm,

01:46.800 --> 01:49.440
spiders that can casts their webs...

01:50.880 --> 01:55.072
..and the bug that wears the bodies
of its victims as a disguise.

01:57.480 --> 02:00.360
Welcome to a strange
and dangerous world.

02:20.700 --> 02:24.540
The tropical rainforests of Africa
are teeming with a huge

02:24.660 --> 02:26.540
variety of insects.

02:28.580 --> 02:32.187
And with so many bugs around,
you might think that finding

02:32.260 --> 02:35.220
a mate would be easy,
but you would be wrong.

02:36.460 --> 02:40.380
Courtship is often, complex,
protracted, fascinating,

02:40.800 --> 02:43.040
and, for some, even brutal.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.240
This is a Goliath beetle -
one of the biggest of all insects.

02:50.360 --> 02:53.263
I know that he's a male,
because he's got these two

02:53.420 --> 02:58.265
horns on the front of his head,
with which he battles for females.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.720
Goliaths are among the strongest
insects in the world.

03:14.140 --> 03:18.860
This male can lift 850 times
his own body weight -

03:18.980 --> 03:22.380
the equivalent of you or me
lifting ten elephants.

03:24.400 --> 03:29.368
He'll need all his strength
to win the right to mate.

03:35.060 --> 03:37.980
The female has no horns.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.980
She doesn't need them.

03:41.860 --> 03:44.410
It's the males that do the fighting.

03:46.740 --> 03:51.201
They face off - each assessing
the threat the other may pose.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.275
It's a savage battle,

03:57.360 --> 04:00.840
with each trying to hook his horn
under the other's shell.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.480
If one of the males flips
his opponent off the branch,

04:05.800 --> 04:08.840
he'll have the female to himself.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.920
The loser retreats.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.680
And, with the duel over,
the winner gets the mate.

05:00.660 --> 05:03.620
On the floor of the
South American forest,

05:03.740 --> 05:06.380
it's all about touch and smell.

05:08.200 --> 05:12.552
Sight is not much use to bugs that
live in the undergrowth.

05:18.240 --> 05:22.640
This male Chilean rose
tarantula is almost blind.

05:24.700 --> 05:29.340
He searches for a mate using smell,
and, when he's close enough,

05:29.460 --> 05:31.060
by touch.

05:34.280 --> 05:39.160
Right now, he's on the trail
of a female, and he's come prepared.

05:39.280 --> 05:43.960
Before he set out, he wove a
silk mat, deposited sperm on it,

05:44.380 --> 05:47.140
and sucked his sperm
into one of his palps -

05:48.060 --> 05:51.140
a finger-like appendage
close to his mouth.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.740
This female has signalled her
presence to him

05:58.860 --> 06:01.416
by emitting a sex hormone.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.180
And he approaches.

06:12.060 --> 06:14.100
He pushes himself beneath her.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.640
Special hooks on his front
legs hold her fangs aside

06:19.760 --> 06:21.606
to prevent her biting him.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.900
His movements also stimulate
sensitive hairs on her underside.

06:34.780 --> 06:40.487
And, with this, she yields, and
he uses his palps to fertilise her.

06:48.280 --> 06:52.707
When she lays her eggs,
the offspring will all be his.

07:03.020 --> 07:07.980
In North America, there's a male
with far less time to find a mate.

07:09.960 --> 07:14.680
He is a nasonia jewel wasp, and he's
no bigger than a match head.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.800
He only lives for two days,
so his entire,

07:20.920 --> 07:23.680
short life is devoted to mating.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.820
And with so little time,

07:28.174 --> 07:31.374
he has an unusual way to ensure
that he's successful.

07:32.960 --> 07:37.520
When he finds a female, he smears
a sex hormone on her antenna.

07:41.980 --> 07:45.540
If she finds it stimulating,
she'll let him mate.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.840
This female doesn't,

07:50.160 --> 07:54.249
and wipes his scent off as fast
as he smears it on.

08:01.320 --> 08:05.560
He has no time to waste, and moves
on to look for another female.

08:07.380 --> 08:09.195
Here's one.

08:16.700 --> 08:20.940
This female likes his scent,
and he mates.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.600
Success.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.200
But to make sure that she doesn't
mate with any others,

08:27.320 --> 08:31.520
he climbs back onto her
and smears on more hormones.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.860
Now other males will not
find her receptive.

08:39.460 --> 08:43.340
And he will be almost certain
to pass on his genes.

08:46.200 --> 08:50.080
At least some of the next
generation will be his.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.831
In the African rainforest,
a particularly dangerous bug

08:55.180 --> 08:59.540
has evolved a surprisingly balletic
way to win his mate.

08:59.660 --> 09:02.420
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

09:07.440 --> 09:10.240
There are over 2,000 species
of scorpion.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.800
And while only 20 of them
are dangerous to humans,

09:15.420 --> 09:18.340
all of them are
deadly to other bugs.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.942
These Tanzanian red claws, like all
scorpions, are mainly nocturnal.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.200
Their mating rituals
generally take place at night.

09:33.980 --> 09:37.140
But their bodies fluoresce
under ultraviolet light,

09:37.260 --> 09:41.529
and that makes it possible for us to
watch their most intimate behaviour.

09:43.980 --> 09:48.020
When the female finds a male,
their extraordinary ritual begins.

09:49.140 --> 09:50.420
They dance.

09:50.640 --> 09:55.120
(SLOW LATIN MUSIC)

10:14.110 --> 10:15.710
He arouses her...

10:15.785 --> 10:18.482
by caressing her mouth parts.

10:27.740 --> 10:32.780
But while he tries to stimulate her,
she is testing his strength.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.240
She yields.

10:49.620 --> 10:53.060
Now he is leading her.

10:58.580 --> 11:01.980
Eventually, he deposits
his sperm on the ground

11:02.100 --> 11:04.540
and gently pulls her onto it.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.880
He's proved his strength
and agility,

11:13.200 --> 11:16.876
and she has ensured the best
possible father for her young.

11:21.333 --> 11:24.733
Arthropods have many fascinating
courtship rituals...

11:27.033 --> 11:29.553
..from the dance of the scorpion...

11:34.480 --> 11:37.600
..to the Goliath beetles'
battle of strength...

11:42.360 --> 11:45.440
..and the tarantulas'
intimate embrace.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.640
But, for some creatures,
courtship is more violent.

11:54.060 --> 11:57.500
And this happens in even
the smallest worlds.

11:59.080 --> 12:04.120
This dish contains a complete
colony of tramp ants.

12:04.740 --> 12:06.300
They're minute.

12:06.620 --> 12:10.260
Each individual is less than
the size of a grain of sand.

12:10.380 --> 12:14.820
So, to see them properly,
we have to use huge magnifications.

12:14.940 --> 12:18.140
But they're worth watching,
because the dominant male has

12:18.260 --> 12:22.420
a really brutal way of ensuring
that only he breeds.

12:30.780 --> 12:34.780
200 times magnification reveals
the intimate workings

12:35.000 --> 12:36.600
of this tiny colony.

12:41.240 --> 12:44.440
A few hundred ants, all at work.

12:47.360 --> 12:51.224
The winged females are queens,
and they're ready to mate.

12:54.760 --> 12:58.600
And these two males are fighting
for the right to mate with them.

13:10.340 --> 13:14.140
The colony's current dominant male
is the yellower of the two.

13:17.420 --> 13:20.900
He must somehow drive all the
other males out of the nest,

13:21.020 --> 13:23.780
leaving him as the
only male that can mate.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.560
But he's not strong enough to
kill the other males himself.

13:33.040 --> 13:36.960
Instead, he gets other ants
to do his dirty work.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.640
He smears a rival male
with a powerful scent.

13:46.540 --> 13:48.980
This makes it smell like an invader.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.900
The colony's sterile worker ants
attack it on the dominant

13:58.020 --> 14:00.260
male's behalf, slicing it in two.

14:03.760 --> 14:08.000
In this colony, at least,
violence pays.

14:24.420 --> 14:27.860
On the forest floors of India,
another insect is taking

14:27.980 --> 14:32.380
a much gentler, but no less devious,
approach to securing a mate.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
These male tropical house
crickets are chirruping by rubbing

14:39.120 --> 14:42.320
their wings together in the hope
of attracting females.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.320
Their calls are so loud that the
females can hear them

14:49.440 --> 14:51.781
from 20 metres away.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.760
This female has made her choice.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.040
But the male has a trick
to increase the chances

15:04.160 --> 15:05.920
of his sperm fertilising her.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.340
He will give her a present.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.180
She sits on top of the male
and tastes him

15:14.300 --> 15:17.780
with her antennae to make sure
she hasn't mated with him already.

15:19.640 --> 15:25.792
He responds by producing a parcel
of sperm, wrapped in a rich syrup.

15:35.440 --> 15:40.000
As he leaves, the parcel
sticks to the female's sex organs.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.200
She eats the syrup...

16:00.140 --> 16:04.140
..and his sperm remains
attached to her sex organs.

16:09.740 --> 16:12.980
This gift of food
distracts the female

16:13.400 --> 16:15.640
as fertilisation takes place...

16:17.400 --> 16:21.600
..and makes her far less likely to
go off searching for another mate.

16:25.840 --> 16:29.720
The male's gift has ensured
that he fathers her offspring.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.840
Throughout the tropics, one insect
has come to symbolise the extremes

16:39.560 --> 16:42.680
that some animals will go to in
order to mate.

16:49.180 --> 16:52.420
Praying mantises are highly
skilled predators...

16:54.340 --> 16:56.540
..and they hunt by sight.

16:57.620 --> 17:01.140
But their hearing is limited
to just one sound.

17:01.260 --> 17:04.579
They can detect bat sonar to
avoid being eaten.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.380
Praying mantises are so named

17:10.599 --> 17:13.520
because of their pius-looking
posture.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.839
But these bugs are neither
meek nor mild.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.800
They are veracious predators.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.120
They'll mostly eat locusts
and crickets

17:32.740 --> 17:36.020
but have been known to eat creatures
far larger than themselves.

18:02.020 --> 18:06.020
This male mantis, climbing up
towards his potential mate,

18:06.440 --> 18:09.520
can have little idea of the danger
that he's in.

18:20.380 --> 18:23.900
Perhaps put off by the unwelcome
advances of the male,

18:24.020 --> 18:25.700
or simply driven by hunger,

18:26.120 --> 18:29.680
the female mantis
begins to eat her suitor.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.360
Holding his upper
body in her left claw,

18:54.480 --> 18:57.970
she starts to chew
through his thorax...

19:03.920 --> 19:07.318
..until the two
halves of his body are only held

19:07.343 --> 19:10.684
together by a thread of flesh.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.393
Eventually, his head drops away.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.680
Remarkably,
this male isn't entirely dead.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.240
He's begun to impregnate her.

19:38.980 --> 19:41.460
The female has removed his head
and, with it,

19:41.580 --> 19:44.860
the brain cells that
control his inhibitions,

19:44.980 --> 19:48.980
but his abdomen has its own
nerve cells.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.480
Cells that control
the act of copulation,

19:52.600 --> 19:57.100
and they allow him to pass on his
genes, even in the throws of death.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.400
In reproductive terms,
this male has succeeded.

20:04.340 --> 20:08.260
But his death is a symbol of how
strangely unfeeling

20:08.380 --> 20:10.380
the arthropod world can be.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.420
Every species of animal must
reproduce.

20:20.840 --> 20:23.520
If it didn't, it would
become extinct.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.800
Arthropods have developed many
different ways of doing so,

20:26.920 --> 20:29.640
some fantastic, some violent,

20:29.760 --> 20:31.640
and their success has led them

20:31.760 --> 20:35.680
to becoming one of the most abundant
forms of animals on this planet.

20:39.260 --> 20:40.860
Bugs will dance, fight

20:40.980 --> 20:44.983
and even sacrifice their lives
just to find a mate.

20:48.980 --> 20:52.112
Courtship is key to their success.

20:54.900 --> 20:57.700
But more important still is
what happens next -

20:58.220 --> 20:59.620
the arrival of offspring.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.580
The birth of a new generation.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.600
In the next programme, I'll meet
the creatures that do without sex

21:09.720 --> 21:13.080
altogether and produce millions
of young in a single summer.

21:14.980 --> 21:17.860
Watch the arrival of thousands
of baby spiders...

21:20.440 --> 21:22.240
..and look at perhaps the most
remarkable

21:22.360 --> 21:24.862
transformation in the animal
kingdom...

21:27.180 --> 21:30.780
The moment when the feeding machine
that was a caterpillar

21:30.900 --> 21:34.860
becomes the breeding
machine that is an adult butterfly.

21:46.260 --> 21:53.280
