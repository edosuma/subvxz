00:05.200 --> 00:06.240
I am Nina!
-You're not.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.080
I am Nina!
-Are you done? -Yes.

00:08.199 --> 00:11.039
Come read this comedy,
"One + One,"

00:11.119 --> 00:12.960
Vera...
-And then we'll see.

00:13.039 --> 00:16.640
She will play the lead role.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.280
We don't exactly...

00:20.039 --> 00:21.280
Have the same issues.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.600
Her co-star will be
the one from TV, Ofer Marziano.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.640
Have you signed the contract?
-I can't talk to you looking like this.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.399
Are you in the middle of a show?
-Listen, don't do it, Ofer.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.280
Don't sign.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.119
Maya, they called you.
-I heard!

00:33.240 --> 00:36.119
Move! Vera, I'm not doing the comedy.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.920
I asked around,
nobody's heard of the director.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.280
Bitch.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.679
I'm an actor.
-I know, I know.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.079
I'm gonna do a play here.

00:48.159 --> 00:50.079
What are you suggesting?

00:50.240 --> 00:51.560
That we just be colleagues?

00:51.920 --> 00:54.399
Listen, I love this play.

00:54.479 --> 00:58.960
It's a shame people won't see it,
just because we're... us.

00:59.640 --> 01:00.640
You're such an idiot.

01:01.679 --> 01:03.920
Did she say yes?

01:23.040 --> 01:27.040
Ofer, is this your first time
in the theater?

01:29.439 --> 01:31.079
As an actor, yes.

01:31.239 --> 01:33.400
No, because otherwise
you have season tickets.

01:36.359 --> 01:38.599
So... welcome.
-Thank you.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.239
FYI we don't have catering here,

01:42.319 --> 01:44.280
but you can eat at the cafeteria

01:44.400 --> 01:45.959
for 20% off.

01:46.599 --> 01:49.439
Got it.
-There's coffee, sandwiches,

01:49.640 --> 01:51.959
tuna, cheese...

01:52.120 --> 01:54.599
Or I can recommend local restaurants.
-Listen,

01:54.640 --> 01:57.359
I'm not a tourist, you know.
I live in this city,

01:57.959 --> 01:59.280
I speak the language too.

01:59.599 --> 02:00.560
I'll manage.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.280
Right, of course.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.439
Well, there's a Middle Eastern place
down the road...

02:06.920 --> 02:09.960
-Morning.
-Sorry I'm late. Good morning.

02:10.439 --> 02:12.039
Good morning. Come.
-Morning.

02:13.639 --> 02:14.960
Iris, come.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.280
We're starting rehearsals for
"One + One"

02:18.479 --> 02:22.240
Written by the... wonderful Iris.

02:22.319 --> 02:24.680
This is exciting.
We've waited a long time for this

02:24.960 --> 02:28.240
and we're thrilled
that you're with us.

02:29.199 --> 02:31.439
Forgive me, it drives me crazy,
but I smell dogshit.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.280
Do you? -Oh yeah.
-Not really.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.560
Please, let's check our shoes.

02:39.319 --> 02:40.120
Maybe...

02:40.199 --> 02:41.560
Ah, it's me.

02:42.439 --> 02:44.199
Me.

02:44.319 --> 02:46.039
My bad.
-Want me to take your shoes?

02:46.120 --> 02:47.560
No, that's OK.

02:47.639 --> 02:50.960
Guys, I want to do it
differently today.

02:51.039 --> 02:54.280
Let's skip the table read.
-Want some wet wipes?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.400
You can clean it with sand.
-What?

02:56.479 --> 02:58.439
Sand...
-Guys, leave it,

02:58.479 --> 02:59.919
It's fine.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.520
We'll leave the table read for later.
-Why?

03:03.599 --> 03:05.400
Why later?
One sec...

03:05.520 --> 03:07.240
Sarel, help me here please.

03:08.439 --> 03:12.280
I want to skip the first scene

03:12.319 --> 03:14.240
and start with the second.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.639
Sounds good.
-I think so too.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.960
It's OK.
The first scene is...

03:20.039 --> 03:22.599
An exposition.
-Exactly.

03:23.199 --> 03:25.560
Let's do something more... dynamic,

03:25.639 --> 03:27.639
with more action,
so we can really dive in.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.080
That way

03:29.199 --> 03:31.680
we'll get to better know the couple.

03:32.439 --> 03:34.039
Great. Thanks, Maya.

03:34.919 --> 03:38.439
Right, so stand here,
facing the mirror.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.120
Here? -You're preparing to leave.
Ofer, you're by the door,

03:42.240 --> 03:43.360
you want to go.

03:44.319 --> 03:47.120
This is our couch for today.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.199
Iris, wanna sit over there?
You'll be more comfortable.

03:50.479 --> 03:52.960
OK.
-And that's it. Let's...

03:54.240 --> 03:55.439
Let's do it...

03:56.240 --> 03:58.639
let's do it
and see how it goes.

03:58.919 --> 04:01.039
Please: scene two, page twelve.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.240
Excuse me a second.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.039
Sorry.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.120
Pick your foot up.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.400
Sorry.
-What?

04:14.240 --> 04:16.920
Sorry, I'm a bit OCD.

04:18.399 --> 04:21.040
What's "a bit OCD"?
You have OCD? -What?

04:21.360 --> 04:22.199
You have OCD?

04:22.279 --> 04:24.040
Have you been diagnosed?

04:24.079 --> 04:26.279
No, but these things drive me crazy.

04:26.439 --> 04:28.959
Totally, me too...

04:29.079 --> 04:31.439
I just can't rehearse.
-Yes.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.199
But no OCD.
-No.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.959
A bit.

04:38.519 --> 04:40.959
Let's begin, scene 2.

05:14.639 --> 05:17.199
Come on, let's go.
-Tzutz.

05:17.279 --> 05:19.279
What?
-You think I gained weight?

05:19.600 --> 05:21.120
We're gonna miss
the beginning.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.519
Come on. -Wait.
-What?

05:23.199 --> 05:25.279
I can't go like this,
my jeans don't fit.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.040
Tzutz, I really wanna go,

05:27.120 --> 05:28.279
why are you stalling?

05:28.360 --> 05:29.920
You think this is on purpose?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.959
Why can't we just go? Why?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.199
Because...
-Because your jeans don't fit?

05:34.240 --> 05:35.360
Because I have a beard.

05:36.040 --> 05:36.959
What?

05:37.040 --> 05:39.240
What are you on about?
-I saw it in the mirror,

05:39.279 --> 05:41.279
I'm growing a beard
like my mum.

05:41.319 --> 05:43.639
I don't get it,
if you don't wanna see the show,

05:43.680 --> 05:44.519
then don't.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.279
Why can't you just say I'm pretty?

05:46.319 --> 05:48.079
Why does it have to be
right now?

05:48.160 --> 05:51.040
It's not like you suddenly have
a massive beard.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.399
It's not like you got fat
in the last five minutes.

05:54.439 --> 05:56.279
So you do see it!
-No, I don't.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.560
Jeez, what a mistake!

05:59.040 --> 06:01.639
The second you spoke about weight,
I should've grabbed your ear

06:01.680 --> 06:03.199
and dragged you out.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.040
We should never stand by the door
for more than two minutes,

06:06.120 --> 06:08.040
it's a danger zone,
I know that!

06:08.120 --> 06:09.639
He takes the keys...

06:09.680 --> 06:11.040
What?

06:11.920 --> 06:13.120
Just say you don't wanna go.

06:13.199 --> 06:14.920
I don't wanna go.
-Fine. Bye.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.439
He opens the door and leaves.

06:17.199 --> 06:18.240
Leaves.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.040
Then comes right back.
-I return? -Yes.

06:29.319 --> 06:32.240
I'm sorry, I'm an idiot.

06:32.319 --> 06:36.079
Thank you. Let's stop.
That was great.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.600
Let's stop here.
-The beard thing doesn't work,

06:38.639 --> 06:40.199
I'd rather not say it, Tomer.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.199
Why, it's weird?

06:42.079 --> 06:43.040
It's idiotic.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.439
I'd rather say
"mustache" instead.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.040
OK, let's try.
-Wait a sec.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.199
Please change from "beard"
to "mustache".

06:49.240 --> 06:50.959
OK.
-Ofer, you're standing on the wall.

06:51.199 --> 06:53.240
Wait, who said it doesn't work?

06:54.199 --> 06:57.040
Let's try something else for a sec.
"Home soon. Come over."

06:57.240 --> 06:58.360
I'll tell you why it doesn't work.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.240
Go on...

07:01.639 --> 07:04.279
When you write comedy,
it doesn't have to be far-fetched.

07:04.399 --> 07:06.639
OK, Maya...
-Iris, learn to listen.

07:07.279 --> 07:09.639
No one can imagine
a beard on a woman,

07:09.680 --> 07:12.120
it's too weird.
If it's unrelatable, it's not funny.

07:12.319 --> 07:14.439
What woman has a beard?
You should've written mustache.

07:15.439 --> 07:17.040
I have a beard.
-What?

07:17.199 --> 07:18.199
I have a beard.
-No you don't.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.360
Don't say that out loud.
-But I do.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.079
Not a full beard,
and I take care of it, it's...

07:23.160 --> 07:25.279
You don't have a beard.
-I do.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.279
She doesn't have a beard.
Let's move on.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.240
Let's try "mustache", OK?
-Yes. -Fine.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.040
"Mustache" instead of "beard".
-Changed it.

07:32.199 --> 07:34.439
Use a pencil, not a pen.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.959
Ofer, you're standing on the wall.
-What? -The wall.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.360
See the tape? That's a wall.
-Babe, it's a wall.

07:40.439 --> 07:41.439
All that is a wall.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.040
I just want to remind you
that the whole point of the scene

07:47.120 --> 07:48.199
is the beard.

07:48.439 --> 07:50.639
Five hairs on her chin
and she feels like an ape

07:50.680 --> 07:52.439
and he's not helping
by not saying that she's pretty.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.959
I know.
-That's the point. -OK.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.199
But maybe the "beard" is too creepy

07:57.240 --> 07:59.240
and gets in the way of the comedy.

07:59.439 --> 08:02.040
That's fine, maybe not every comedy
is funny.

08:02.199 --> 08:03.199
What?

08:04.480 --> 08:08.639
Fine, I've decided
we're saying "mustache".

08:08.920 --> 08:11.560
Except I wrote the play,
so I decide too, got it?

08:13.480 --> 08:15.680
Excuse us.
Come with me.

08:16.199 --> 08:17.560
Sorry.

08:22.040 --> 08:25.279
"Stay put. I'm coming."

08:26.360 --> 08:28.279
You think it's funny?

08:28.639 --> 08:30.040
What? This?

08:31.439 --> 08:32.600
Yeah.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.440
Listen, boss,

08:35.679 --> 08:39.279
I'm outta here by noon, OK?

08:40.679 --> 08:42.200
Tell me,

08:42.279 --> 08:45.360
is Weizman Street open now?

08:45.639 --> 08:47.080
Your sister's in the hospital again?

08:47.279 --> 08:48.960
The same one?
-Huh?

08:49.200 --> 08:50.039
How is she?

08:50.679 --> 08:53.080
She's such a sweetheart.

08:53.559 --> 08:54.639
Yes, but what's wrong with her?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.639
We're waiting.
They don't know.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.360
Got it.

09:02.559 --> 09:04.200
I hope she feels better.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.120
Please allow me to
run the rehearsal.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.200
I'm letting you...
-Keep it down.

09:12.480 --> 09:15.519
But don't dismiss me
in front of everyone.

09:15.919 --> 09:17.399
You're not on my side.
-I am.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.440
No you're not.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.240
It's hard for me, the text is...

09:21.279 --> 09:23.559
Stop shushing me!

09:23.639 --> 09:24.279
Fine.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.639
Can't you just tell me later
what's bothering you?

09:31.360 --> 09:34.440
Unfortunately for you, the playwright
isn't dead, -I can see that.

09:34.559 --> 09:37.279
Then please consult with me
before you change my text.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.279
OK. Come here a sec.

09:39.639 --> 09:41.039
Give me a Xanax.

09:43.639 --> 09:44.440
Take it.

09:47.039 --> 09:47.679
It's empty.

09:48.279 --> 09:49.960
I guess I took the last one.
-Why?

09:50.519 --> 09:51.960
Because I'm not your pharmacist!

09:52.039 --> 09:54.519
You want pills?
Get your own prescription, got it?

09:55.039 --> 09:58.679
Tomer,
Ofer says he's leaving at noon.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.120
I'm coming.

10:04.279 --> 10:06.639
Fix your socks
so you don't trigger her OCD.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.960
We're back.

10:15.279 --> 10:17.639
Let's move on from the beard.

10:17.919 --> 10:20.240
Yes, no biggie,
it's just written badly. -Right.

10:20.919 --> 10:24.279
Let's go with "I have a mustache".

10:24.559 --> 10:27.120
Let's go from "I have a mustache".
-No, no,

10:27.200 --> 10:29.200
I'm sorry. -Seriously?
-Guys,

10:29.240 --> 10:32.440
we're not in the '90s, everyone knows
women have upper-lip hair.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.200
Iris, how about you write that she has
a horn growing too?

10:35.240 --> 10:37.200
I told you, I have a beard.
-She has a beard?

10:37.360 --> 10:39.360
She doesn't...
Can you stop saying

10:39.440 --> 10:41.240
that you have a beard?
You don't have...

10:41.279 --> 10:44.279
It's not a beard. -I do.
-It's a single hair,

10:44.360 --> 10:46.120
not a beard.
-It's gross.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.639
Listen, I have an idea,

10:47.919 --> 10:50.960
Maya, say,
"I have hairy armpits",

10:51.039 --> 10:52.360
let's see if it works.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.279
What's to see?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.440
"I have hairy armpits"?

10:56.559 --> 10:58.639
I've had hairy armpits
since I was six. Enough.

10:59.039 --> 11:01.039
She doesn't wanna go
because of hairy armpits?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.440
So I should never leave the house?

11:02.559 --> 11:04.440
How about I say
I have cellulite?

11:04.559 --> 11:06.279
No, no, guys, no,

11:06.360 --> 11:08.919
no cellulite.
I want this to be about

11:09.039 --> 11:11.039
the little beard she's growing,

11:11.120 --> 11:14.919
just like many women,
except Maya.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.559
Stop it, everyone has cellulite.
-Not everyone,

11:17.639 --> 11:19.039
but it's funny, it will work.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.120
And I'm sure you can relate.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.399
You don't have cellulite?
-Nope.

11:31.639 --> 11:32.440
Tzutz...
-Don't call me Tzutz.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.440
You don't have to answer.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.200
Guys, we can try cellulite
and then mustache...

11:36.240 --> 11:38.279
This is theater,
it doesn't cost to try.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.679
"I have a mustache",
then "I have cellulite".

11:41.960 --> 11:43.639
Ofer, you're standing on the wall.

11:44.039 --> 11:45.919
What do you want from me?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.360
Tell me, do you have pubic hair?
-Iris...

11:48.440 --> 11:49.440
No? Nipple hair?

11:49.480 --> 11:51.639
What am I, a baboon?
You have nipple hair?

11:51.679 --> 11:52.559
Me? No.

11:52.639 --> 11:54.279
Let's stop with the nonesense.

11:54.639 --> 11:56.240
Are your feet twisted so they can

11:56.279 --> 11:57.639
fit in heels?

11:57.679 --> 11:58.639
This is stupid.

11:58.679 --> 11:59.639
She's doing it on purpose.

11:59.679 --> 12:01.120
What do you want me to say?

12:01.279 --> 12:02.200
She's nuts.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.200
Have you ever dieted?
-Yes.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.200
Thank god!

12:06.240 --> 12:07.600
To gain weight.
I was underweight at school,

12:07.639 --> 12:08.639
too skinny.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.279
Are you kidding?

12:11.360 --> 12:12.960
She's screwing around.

12:13.039 --> 12:15.120
Breathe. -Listen...
-Get some water.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.200
She's lying.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.960
She's doing it on purpose, she's lying.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.679
OK?

12:23.360 --> 12:25.200
Shall we move on?

12:31.279 --> 12:32.679
Right... well...

12:33.440 --> 12:36.960
Obviously, this woman
isn't right for the role.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.960
She can't

12:39.200 --> 12:41.639
relate to someone
who can't fit in their jeans

12:42.000 --> 12:43.279
or feels shitty
in front of a mirror

12:43.360 --> 12:45.279
or whose boyfriend
doesn't call her pretty.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.240
She can't relate,

12:47.279 --> 12:48.279
she can't even pretend.

12:48.679 --> 12:52.240
It's so unimaginable for her,
like I kept saying.

12:52.360 --> 12:56.039
So tell Ms. Vera to come
and look at her perfect ass

12:56.200 --> 12:58.279
and tell me
she's right for the part.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.039
Right, I don't need this bullshit,

13:00.120 --> 13:01.960
I'm not taking
this role anyway,

13:02.039 --> 13:04.200
This was just a favor
until I start rehearsals for "The Seagull."

13:04.679 --> 13:06.559
Sorry, Tomer,
I felt bad telling you.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.120
Good luck.
-Thanks.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.120
Let's take... five minutes?

13:26.480 --> 13:29.240
Ofer, take five.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.639
Thanks. -Tomer,
can I go to the restroom? -Yes.

13:33.039 --> 13:34.200
It's urgent.

13:41.679 --> 13:42.639
Yes, Ofer?

13:45.200 --> 13:47.360
You think...
we're done for today?

13:48.440 --> 13:51.039
I don't...
I don't really know.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.360
You have to go, right?

13:53.120 --> 13:54.639
Yeah, no, it's...

13:55.000 --> 13:56.279
my sister's in the hospital...

13:56.360 --> 13:58.279
for a while now.
-I see.

13:58.360 --> 14:02.240
What... what's wrong with her?
-We're waiting.

14:03.559 --> 14:04.679
We don't know.

14:06.919 --> 14:08.240
So, then...

14:09.279 --> 14:12.039
if you have to go, then go.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.440
No... if you need me, I'll stay.

14:14.559 --> 14:17.639
I'd appreciate it if you could stay
while we figure this out. Thanks.

14:17.679 --> 14:20.519
You're the director,
whatever you need. -Thanks.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.120
If...

14:23.240 --> 14:25.240
if I could leave now,

14:25.919 --> 14:27.440
it would help.

14:28.399 --> 14:31.440
So... whatever you need.

14:31.679 --> 14:34.559
No, you're the director...
whatever you need.

14:37.039 --> 14:38.080
I...

14:38.480 --> 14:39.639
I need.

14:40.559 --> 14:42.279
OK.
-OK.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.200
What?

14:48.440 --> 14:49.960
Whatever you need.

14:50.279 --> 14:53.200
I'll make coffee.
Want coffee? -No, thanks.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.639
Come with me a sec.
Come.

15:00.919 --> 15:02.279
This is our chance to get rid of her.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.120
Seriously...
-What?

15:04.200 --> 15:05.639
Don't you get it?

15:06.200 --> 15:07.600
We have no play without them.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.120
They're the only reason our
play was greenlit.

15:12.440 --> 15:16.200
Or maybe because it's a good play?
-Yeah, sure.

15:52.440 --> 15:56.039
Yesterday I saw episodes
19 and 20

15:56.559 --> 15:58.279
of "Love Under Fire",

15:58.919 --> 16:00.360
with the Spam scene.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.279
It was hilarious.

16:03.559 --> 16:06.240
Did you really eat Spam
or was it something else?

16:06.279 --> 16:08.279
I think it was bolognese,
I don't remember.

16:08.559 --> 16:10.200
Karina, remind her I'm waiting.

16:10.279 --> 16:12.200
I did, it'll be a little longer.

16:17.919 --> 16:18.559
Hi.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.279
Hi.

16:20.639 --> 16:22.039
I'm...

16:23.360 --> 16:24.440
I'm really sorry.

16:24.559 --> 16:27.360
Tomer, there's no need
to apologize...

16:27.440 --> 16:28.440
No, there is a need.

16:28.559 --> 16:32.039
Leave it, it's not about ego.
-Maya, let me.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.360
It was uncalled for.
And you're so amazing,

16:37.480 --> 16:41.360
professional, serious.
-OK.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.360
And you're talented, obviously.

16:43.559 --> 16:47.120
You didn't deserve what happened.
-That's right.

16:47.480 --> 16:51.440
I'll make sure rehearsals
run differently from now on,

16:51.679 --> 16:53.360
maybe she'll come less
to rehearsals,

16:53.440 --> 16:55.559
or not at all. We'll see.

16:56.120 --> 16:56.960
Tomer,

16:58.360 --> 16:59.919
you're a great guy,

17:00.240 --> 17:02.559
and although I haven't
seen your work yet

17:03.000 --> 17:04.240
and we don't know
how far you'll get,

17:04.279 --> 17:05.440
but if you get there,

17:05.920 --> 17:08.039
I'm sure we'll work together again.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.119
OK.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.559
Iris also has something to say.
-Tomer...

17:13.640 --> 17:15.400
-No, it's important.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.240
Guys, this is embarrassing.
-I...

17:25.279 --> 17:26.559
apologize

17:27.480 --> 17:28.640
for my behavior.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.039
It's fine, I'm used to this attitude
from women.

17:31.960 --> 17:34.039
I don't think that's what it is.
-OK.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.039
I think maybe I'm...

17:38.559 --> 17:41.440
I'm excited by...

17:42.279 --> 17:45.200
this new project, so I...
-Of course.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.440
I know how much this play means to you,
it's your baby.

17:49.119 --> 17:52.279
I know you see yourself
in the play through me.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.279
And if I were to do this role,

17:55.640 --> 17:57.640
I'd really become your character.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.240
I'd study you, research you...

18:02.160 --> 18:06.240
I'd gain as much weight
as needed and...

18:06.440 --> 18:09.440
do your hair and these...

18:12.680 --> 18:14.279
But that's not gonna happen.

18:14.480 --> 18:17.559
I'm doing Nina,
I'm going in to see Vera now about it.

18:18.440 --> 18:19.440
Sorry.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.680
OK. Good luck.

18:34.039 --> 18:36.279
We made it only one day. One.

18:49.039 --> 18:49.680
"Tzutz,"

18:50.079 --> 18:54.920
"I really wanna go,
why are you stalling?"

18:56.440 --> 18:58.920
"Tzutz, I really wanna go,"

18:59.000 --> 19:00.559
"why are you stall..."

19:01.039 --> 19:02.640
"Tzutz, I really wanna go,"

19:02.680 --> 19:04.119
"why are you stalling?"

19:04.240 --> 19:06.279
Want some coffee?
I'm making some.

19:06.680 --> 19:10.279
No, no. -You know, without
three strong coffees,

19:10.640 --> 19:12.440
I can't wake up.
-Oh yeah?

19:15.480 --> 19:17.240
Maya's difficult, right?

19:20.279 --> 19:21.279
Ofer,

19:22.039 --> 19:23.240
did you...

19:25.400 --> 19:27.279
send me a dick pic?

19:31.440 --> 19:32.279
What?

19:33.200 --> 19:37.400
I got a photo from your number

19:38.240 --> 19:38.680
of a dick.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.440
Fuck...

19:43.240 --> 19:44.960
Is it yours?
-I'm so embarrassed.

19:45.039 --> 19:47.519
Why did you send me a dick pic?
-I didn't send it to you.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.359
It was a mistake,
I can't believe this happened.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.440
It's OK. -Delete it.
-Of course.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.240
It was meant for my doctor.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.640
What? -My urologist.

19:59.359 --> 20:01.200
Why does a urologist need
a picture of your dick?

20:01.240 --> 20:03.359
I have a mole
that he's keeping an eye on.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.599
Fuck... -A mole?
So you need a dermatologist.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.440
No, it's a urologist.
In my contacts...

20:09.519 --> 20:12.039
he's saved as Ira the urologist.

20:12.079 --> 20:15.119
That's right before Iris.

20:15.240 --> 20:15.920
That's why...

20:16.039 --> 20:17.440
You mixed them up.
-I'm so sorry,

20:17.519 --> 20:19.240
I can't believe this happened.
-It's OK.

20:19.279 --> 20:21.640
It's not OK, Iris, it's awful.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.440
As awful as it gets. -No it isn't.
-Promise me.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.960
Of course, of course.
-Please.

20:27.319 --> 20:29.400
It was just...
-Of course!

20:29.440 --> 20:30.559
You promise?
-Of course.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.400
I won't tell anyone.

20:33.279 --> 20:34.599
How embarrassing.

20:36.559 --> 20:38.119
So it wasn't meant for me?

20:40.319 --> 20:42.240
No.
No, no.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.279
OK.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.039
I'm sorry. -Fine.

20:51.319 --> 20:53.279
It's fine.

21:04.279 --> 21:07.119
Hey, girl.
-Hi, darling.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.279
Invite me to your show.

21:09.319 --> 21:10.440
Yeah? Sure thing.
-Great.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.119
Listen,
you won't believe it.

21:14.079 --> 21:15.119
I got Nina.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.559
What?

21:16.640 --> 21:19.440
The Austrian director,
Grushovsky, loves me.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.200
He gave me Nina
from "The Seagull."

21:22.039 --> 21:23.400
Crazy, right?

21:27.039 --> 21:28.400
What? You want the part?

21:30.279 --> 21:31.400
Come on...

21:31.519 --> 21:32.680
You wanted Nina?

21:33.599 --> 21:34.559
No.

21:35.240 --> 21:39.200
Seriously! I'm sorry, shit.

21:39.480 --> 21:40.680
Listen, it's nothing.

21:41.079 --> 21:43.640
He saw my picture
and decided he wants a 'modern' Nina.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.440
He's never seen me act.

21:46.039 --> 21:47.119
It's nothing, just a trend.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.119
I'm the "new woman",
representing all sizes.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.599
It's not about talent.

21:53.119 --> 21:54.119
Now it's oversized women,

21:54.480 --> 21:56.680
before it was Asians, black women.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.599
It'll come back to...

21:58.960 --> 21:59.960
blondes.

22:00.279 --> 22:01.279
It's a cycle.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.559
OK?
-Yes, I...

22:07.279 --> 22:10.079
it's fine.
-Yeah? OK.

22:11.119 --> 22:12.279
See you on the bus?

22:13.359 --> 22:15.240
Where are we today?
-North.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.240
Damn.
Sorry.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.039
Well, princess,
are you coming or what?

22:33.039 --> 22:34.640
Vera is waiting.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.400
Yes?

22:45.079 --> 22:46.400
What's this about panels?

22:46.599 --> 22:47.440
What panels?

22:47.680 --> 22:52.519
I requested panels
to indicate walls.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.960
But the floor is marked.

22:55.119 --> 23:01.119
Yes, but Ofer has a hard time
telling the wall from the door.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.279
Where there's a wall, is a wall,

23:03.920 --> 23:05.599
and a door is a door.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.400
We get it, guys,

23:07.440 --> 23:09.279
panels are the least of our problems.

23:10.039 --> 23:11.440
A crisis?
-Yes.

23:11.599 --> 23:12.599
Already?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.240
Yes.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.279
Shame. It's a good play.

23:18.519 --> 23:20.279
You read the play?
-Why not?

23:20.519 --> 23:21.279
No...

23:21.400 --> 23:22.440
I always do.

23:23.279 --> 23:26.640
It's good, funny,
a hit. -Thanks.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.920
So, you're really a couple?

23:30.279 --> 23:31.960
We were for five years...

23:32.039 --> 23:33.640
Not anymore.
-Not anymore.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.519
Not anymore.
-Did that scene really happen?

23:39.039 --> 23:40.240
What was the concert?

23:41.319 --> 23:43.519
What? -It says in the play that
you went to a concert.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.279
Oh, Sting, but no,
I didn't go.

23:45.359 --> 23:46.960
"Roxanne..."

23:49.599 --> 23:51.680
Sting is the best!
And you didn't go?

23:53.640 --> 23:55.279
Let's do this.

23:56.480 --> 23:59.200
I'm willing to give it
another shot.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.680
Bravo. -Great.

24:01.039 --> 24:02.119
Hallelujah.

24:02.599 --> 24:04.640
Awesome.
Thanks, Maya.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.279
Sarel, get Ofer, please.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.279
Right, let's use the time
we have left productively.

24:13.319 --> 24:16.200
Let's start where we left off.
-What's the line? I don't care.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.440
"I have a mustache."
-Thank you.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.960
We're continuing?
-Yes.

24:25.319 --> 24:27.400
Ofer, just don't stand on the wall.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.240
Get off my back.
-Leave him alone.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.519
From where?
-From... show me,

24:32.599 --> 24:33.680
from...

24:35.079 --> 24:36.400
"Just say you don't wanna go."

24:36.440 --> 24:39.119
Just say you don't wanna go.
-I don't wanna go.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.119
Fine. Bye.

24:44.440 --> 24:45.440
And come back.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.279
Sorry, Tzutz, I...

24:52.160 --> 24:54.279
I'm sorry,
I'm an idiot.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.240
I'm the idiot. Sorry, Tzutz.
-No, no,

24:59.279 --> 25:01.440
I want to stay with you
and your beard

25:01.480 --> 25:04.200
"Mustache".
-Your mustache and chill.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.400
OK, hold on.
Ofer, why did you come back?

25:08.240 --> 25:10.359
I don't know.
Because...

25:10.440 --> 25:11.440
I love her.

25:12.039 --> 25:13.240
No, because...

25:13.480 --> 25:15.640
I won't enjoy the concert without her.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.440
You would though, right?

25:17.559 --> 25:19.200
Listen man, I...

25:19.240 --> 25:21.240
I'm no Jack Nicholson, OK?

25:21.279 --> 25:23.559
I roll with it but if it's not working

25:23.640 --> 25:25.440
just replace me.
-Wait...

25:25.480 --> 25:27.279
It's all good.
-Ofer, you're excellent,

25:27.400 --> 25:28.279
listen a sec.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.519
You were excited for the concert,
bought tickets

25:30.599 --> 25:33.240
two months in advance?
Why not go? Why come back?

25:33.279 --> 25:36.240
Because that's what the text says.
-OK, come.

25:36.319 --> 25:38.119
He takes the keys.
-What?

25:38.279 --> 25:40.240
He takes the keys.
-Keys. -We got it.

25:40.279 --> 25:41.279
He's right,
we took the keys,

25:41.400 --> 25:43.400
and left.
OK, bye.

25:44.079 --> 25:45.519
What?

25:48.079 --> 25:49.400
So, you're standing here

25:49.440 --> 25:51.039
and you know
that if you go back in

25:51.079 --> 25:52.440
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life,

25:52.559 --> 25:53.440
so why do you go back?

25:53.960 --> 25:55.680
Your directing's confusing...
-No, no,

25:55.960 --> 25:56.599
Why do you go back?

25:57.319 --> 25:59.039
I should leave her alone?

25:59.240 --> 26:01.279
She's having a crappy day,
her jeans don't fit.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.279
Good! Why didn't she try
on the jeans earlier?

26:03.400 --> 26:05.039
Why try them only now?

26:05.079 --> 26:06.279
Why not
tell her she's pretty?

26:06.400 --> 26:07.599
Let's tell her she's pretty,

26:07.680 --> 26:09.960
she'll come out, end of story.
-No, no,

26:10.039 --> 26:12.079
we're not slaves to her manipulations.
Understand?

26:12.240 --> 26:14.400
She can't ruin this
because she's self centered,

26:14.440 --> 26:17.119
there are other people in the world.
So why go back?

26:17.440 --> 26:19.519
Because she ruined it.
-Exactly.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.119
And if you go now
you'll be thinking about her,

26:22.279 --> 26:23.240
so why go?

26:23.319 --> 26:25.200
Might as well not.
-Exactly.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.359
Now, listen,

26:26.599 --> 26:29.440
go back, because
that's what she wrote, OK?

26:29.559 --> 26:32.039
But when you go back,
look her in the eye and say

26:32.079 --> 26:34.079
you're a bad person...
-Wait, is that a new line?

26:34.160 --> 26:35.599
What?
-No, I just...

26:35.640 --> 26:36.960
I need it...
-No, no.

26:37.039 --> 26:38.440
I need it to be written.

26:38.559 --> 26:39.960
No, no.
-It's OK.

26:40.039 --> 26:43.240
Boss, I need...
-Ofer, leave it.

26:43.279 --> 26:45.240
I'll say it,
but I need it written down.

26:45.279 --> 26:47.240
The same lines, thank you.

26:48.039 --> 26:51.640
Tell her, "I love you."
What's the line?

26:52.039 --> 26:54.519
"I want to stay with you
and your mustache." -Thanks.

26:54.599 --> 26:55.599
You say the words,

26:55.640 --> 26:58.440
while your eyes say,
"You're a bad person and I'm mad at you."

26:58.519 --> 27:00.279
With my eyes.
-Exactly.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.079
That's the subtext.
-Yes. -OK?

27:02.160 --> 27:03.279
Words, "I love you,"

27:03.400 --> 27:05.279
eyes,
"I can't stand you."

27:06.079 --> 27:07.400
"I can't stand you."

27:08.039 --> 27:10.640
"And because you want me
to tell you you're pretty,"

27:10.920 --> 27:12.279
"I'll never say it."

27:12.960 --> 27:14.240
"And you know why the jeans won't fit?"

27:14.319 --> 27:17.440
"Because you eat pita bread at night,
that's the truth." Got it?

27:18.160 --> 27:19.440
OK? And then go in.

27:20.279 --> 27:21.400
Not through the wall.

27:22.039 --> 27:24.640
That's it, get up and
show me where the wall is.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.599
Where's the wall?
Is this a wall?

27:28.079 --> 27:30.039
I want to see where the wall is.
-Ofer...

27:30.079 --> 27:32.039
No, Tomer, is this a wall?

27:32.079 --> 27:34.039
This is a wall. -And this?
Also a wall? -Ofer...

27:34.079 --> 27:35.119
Is this a wall?
-Also...

27:35.279 --> 27:37.240
And this must be a window.

27:37.319 --> 27:39.519
What do I see if I open the window?

27:39.599 --> 27:40.680
Maybe another wall.
-Ofer.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.200
I want a socket.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.920
To charge my phone.

27:44.039 --> 27:45.519
Where's the socket?
-Ofer, Ofer...

27:45.599 --> 27:47.240
Then stop it, OK?
-Ofer...

27:47.279 --> 27:48.599
Tomer, sorry.
-Alright.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.400
That's why I wanted panels.
-Sarel, drop it.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.240
He doesn't need...
-Sarel, stop.

27:53.279 --> 27:55.640
That's why I...
-Leave me alone.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.440
It's hard as it is...
-Guys, enough!

27:57.519 --> 28:00.079
Tomorrow there will be a wall!
Enough.

28:02.079 --> 28:03.519
Let's call it a day, OK?

28:05.680 --> 28:07.519
We're all tired, it was...
quite a day.

28:08.279 --> 28:11.279
Come, let's do something to
finish the day off.

28:11.319 --> 28:12.400
Come.

28:12.599 --> 28:15.240
Iris, you too.
Sarel, you too.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.640
Let's do an exercise.

28:17.519 --> 28:19.200
That shows we're

28:19.440 --> 28:22.240
in it together.
It'll be good for us.

28:22.279 --> 28:24.240
I'm sure it's familiar,
but let's do it anyway.

28:24.279 --> 28:25.279
Maya, you're with me.

28:25.519 --> 28:27.240
Great, turn around.

28:27.319 --> 28:28.039
Yes.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.079
Let's do a fresh start.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.240
Close your eyes.

28:33.039 --> 28:36.279
On three fall back

28:36.400 --> 28:38.400
straight into my arms.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.240
Trust me to catch you, OK?

28:41.160 --> 28:42.559
One, two...

28:42.640 --> 28:43.400
Wait, wait!

28:45.279 --> 28:46.279
I didn't say "three".

28:46.319 --> 28:48.119
Shit...
-Oh no.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.559
Do we have a first aid kit?

28:51.640 --> 28:53.279
I'll check.
Yes, I'll get it.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.960
Am I bleeding?
-I didn't say "three".

28:57.240 --> 28:59.279
No, you're not.

29:00.279 --> 29:01.519
Just a small bump.

29:07.599 --> 29:09.119
I didn't say "three".
I said, "one, two".

29:09.240 --> 29:10.279
No, you didn't, she...

29:14.440 --> 29:16.079
You'll be fine.
-It hurts.

29:19.079 --> 29:21.519
It hurts now, but it'll pass.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.079
Get in, I'll take you.
-Huh?

30:00.039 --> 30:01.279
I'll take you home.

30:02.039 --> 30:03.279
No, I'll take the bus, thanks.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.279
Stop it, get in.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.440
I'll take the bus.
-Let me take you home.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.960
We'll talk about how we
can work together.

30:21.319 --> 30:24.279
I don't think you need to be
there every day.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.599
OK...

30:30.160 --> 30:32.279
And how will I know if
you make changes that I won't like?

30:32.519 --> 30:33.440
I'll tell you.

30:34.359 --> 30:35.640
Sarel will write down
the changes

30:35.680 --> 30:37.960
and email you
after every rehearsal.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.440
So when can I see a rehearsal?

30:42.079 --> 30:45.119
You want to set days...
every other weekend?

30:49.680 --> 30:51.440
You're gonna miss the turn.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.920
Where are you going?

30:57.559 --> 30:59.039
It's fine.

31:00.039 --> 31:01.559
What's fine? You're...

31:02.279 --> 31:04.359
gonna miss the...

31:05.079 --> 31:07.119
Tzutz, turn here!
Turn here.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.599
We've left the city,
it's a huge detour now.

31:17.319 --> 31:19.440
You're making the
biggest mistake of your life.

31:20.599 --> 31:22.359
What?
-Are you seeing someone?

31:26.400 --> 31:28.079
Did you just kidnap me?

31:28.240 --> 31:30.960
Answer me.
-Are you nuts? What is this?

31:31.039 --> 31:32.279
Well?

31:32.640 --> 31:34.640
What "well"? No,
I'm not seeing anyone,

31:34.680 --> 31:36.119
when was I supposed to meet someone?

31:37.160 --> 31:38.640
Then you're going to be
a slick bachelor.

31:39.279 --> 31:41.599
I won't be a slick bachelor.
-Why not?

31:41.640 --> 31:42.440
You're at that age.

31:42.519 --> 31:45.119
You'll roam the city,
look for "the one"

31:45.319 --> 31:46.599
like you have zero responsibilities,

31:46.640 --> 31:48.079
until it's not exciting anymore

31:48.160 --> 31:49.640
and you'll forget
how to be in a relationship,

31:49.960 --> 31:51.400
grow old and die alone.

31:51.440 --> 31:54.039
Please take the next exit.
-You'll want me again

31:54.079 --> 31:56.240
but I won't want you.
-Got it.

31:56.279 --> 31:58.279
I won't wait for you.
-Got it!

32:01.400 --> 32:02.279
Are you stopping here?

32:02.359 --> 32:03.440
You can't stop here.

32:05.599 --> 32:08.119
You think you're gonna leave me?
Do you?

32:08.400 --> 32:10.359
You think you're gonna
throw me back into

32:10.440 --> 32:12.240
that shit with all those
sad people and Tinder

32:12.279 --> 32:14.440
and dick pics
they send to each other?

32:14.640 --> 32:16.400
Do you know what's going
on out there?

32:16.440 --> 32:17.640
Tzutz!

32:18.119 --> 32:20.279
Please drive,
take the next exit,

32:20.319 --> 32:22.400
I want to go home.
-Which home?

32:22.680 --> 32:24.960
To your mother?
-You can't stop here.

32:25.079 --> 32:27.440
Can I say what I think is going on?

32:28.400 --> 32:30.640
You're asking for my permission?
You've kidnapped me...

32:31.039 --> 32:32.599
I think... Tzutz,

32:32.960 --> 32:36.240
that the kid thing freaked you out.
That's all.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.279
So maybe you're not ready for a kid,

32:39.319 --> 32:41.400
and that's OK. I'll wait.

32:45.200 --> 32:48.039
You don't listen,
you never listen.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.279
What?

32:53.400 --> 32:55.519
I'm not sure I love you.

32:58.960 --> 32:59.960
I heard.

33:01.319 --> 33:02.599
And...

33:03.400 --> 33:05.079
And you're talking nonsense.

33:05.599 --> 33:08.039
You're not sure, I am, that's it.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.960
I'm telling you that you love me.
It's on me.

33:11.039 --> 33:12.559
Don't be sure,
I'm sure for you.

33:12.640 --> 33:17.240
You're so confused that
you can't even recognize love.

33:17.279 --> 33:20.359
So I'm telling you:
this is love!

33:20.519 --> 33:23.599
Babe, this is love.
This is what it feels like.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.119
OK, but I'm...

33:25.240 --> 33:27.440
not sure this is how love feels.

33:27.519 --> 33:29.079
OK, prove you don't love me.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.640
What?
-You can't prove it.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.079
I have proof. You make me
a sandwich when I'm hungry,

33:36.440 --> 33:38.960
you love to read everything I write,

33:39.039 --> 33:41.640
and you answer my dad's calls
instead of me.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.440
That's it. Nothing more.

33:45.279 --> 33:48.279
There are so many couples that
are wrong for each other

33:48.359 --> 33:49.640
but they still stick together,

33:49.960 --> 33:52.240
and we're breaking up?
Why?

33:52.319 --> 33:54.960
Why are you forcing me
to market myself?

33:55.039 --> 33:57.039
Tzutz, I need space, OK?

33:57.079 --> 34:00.400
To get some perspective.
-Why? Why?

34:00.519 --> 34:01.599
Tzutz, do me a favor,

34:01.640 --> 34:04.519
help me break up with you!
-I want to help you,

34:04.599 --> 34:06.200
but there's nothing in it for me!

34:08.679 --> 34:10.280
What a mistake!

34:12.599 --> 34:14.280
What a mistake!

34:15.039 --> 34:18.280
You were so young when we started dating.

34:18.519 --> 34:21.280
I'm your age. -Yes,
but I'm your first serious girlfriend.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.400
Who was before me,
the camp counselor?

34:23.440 --> 34:25.639
You were half virgin before me.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.280
Is it my fault
you were with 100 men?

34:27.440 --> 34:29.280
I wasn't with 100 men.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.039
What am I...
A whore?

34:31.199 --> 34:33.280
You did, you had tons.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.280
Can you trust me a second?

34:37.599 --> 34:39.599
I'm telling you, from experience,

34:40.159 --> 34:43.039
you got it right the first time.

34:43.960 --> 34:47.039
You hit the jackpot.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.440
You know? You and I...

34:50.599 --> 34:52.400
Tzutz, we're meant to be.

34:57.159 --> 34:58.440
Tzutz...

34:59.480 --> 35:01.280
I need to feel it for myself.

35:02.679 --> 35:04.639
You telling me isn't enough.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.639
You're really breaking my heart.

35:14.679 --> 35:16.119
I know.

35:20.039 --> 35:22.039
I love you so much.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.639
I know.

35:27.480 --> 35:28.639
Thank you.
-What?

35:30.239 --> 35:31.440
What "thank you"?

35:32.440 --> 35:34.519
What "thank you"!?

35:34.599 --> 35:37.559
This isn't charity!
"Thank you..."

35:39.639 --> 35:42.239
I gave you my most fertile years.

35:43.679 --> 35:45.639
You idiot, I wanted a child.

35:47.239 --> 35:48.599
I know.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.400
Yes, I knew too.
