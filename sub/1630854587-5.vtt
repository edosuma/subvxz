00:16.541 --> 00:20.833
Welcome to the grand opening
of the Lovely Museum of Fine Art.

00:20.916 --> 00:25.458
This is the most culture this town has had
since Hobo-Cop gave us all impetigo.

00:25.541 --> 00:26.708
I'm a hugger.

00:28.875 --> 00:33.791
We are honored to have famous art critic
Dante Diderot here tonight.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.500
And if anyone doubts
his credentials, he is gay.

00:36.583 --> 00:37.916
Whoo!

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Dante, please say a few words
about these magnificent works of art.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.166
Every artist is a hack.

00:44.250 --> 00:48.291
Even those half-monkeys
who made the Lascaux cave paintings.

00:48.375 --> 00:49.958
All art is shit.

00:50.916 --> 00:52.708
Inspiring.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.625
I never quite understood this one.
Do you like it?

00:55.708 --> 00:57.500
Like it? Hell, I'm in it.

00:58.041 --> 01:02.458
The original title
was <i>Hopson Blowing Alien Wizard</i>.

01:02.541 --> 01:05.583
It all finally makes sense.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.708
Karen Crawford,

01:06.791 --> 01:11.625
I hope this museum gives you
the positive human emotion of happiness.

01:11.708 --> 01:14.625
More than a box of Kmart wine.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.083
Where is your husband?

01:16.166 --> 01:20.791
I enjoyed discussing human feet-ball
with him at the sustenance hour

01:20.875 --> 01:25.541
as we consumed and digested
the flesh of bovine land mammal.

01:25.625 --> 01:27.041
I don't know how to respond to that,

01:27.125 --> 01:29.250
so I'm just gonna show
more cleavage, okay?

01:32.125 --> 01:34.666
Ah, shit, I'm late. Karen's gonna kill me.

01:34.750 --> 01:35.666
Hey, Siri.

01:35.750 --> 01:38.250
<i>No Siri. Only Vlad.</i>

01:38.333 --> 01:41.250
Vlad? All right.
I guess Lovely Phones have Vlad.

01:41.333 --> 01:43.625
Okay, Vlad. Route me to the museum.

01:43.708 --> 01:48.583
<i>You don't want go to museum.</i>
<i>Vlad get you girls. You like.</i>

01:48.666 --> 01:51.666
What? No, I need directions to the museum!

01:51.750 --> 01:54.125
<i>No museum. Strip club.</i>

01:54.208 --> 01:57.291
<i>Routing to the Iron Beef Curtain.</i>

01:57.375 --> 01:59.500
Huh? I'm not going to the--

01:59.583 --> 02:01.583
Wow. They have a buffet?

02:02.125 --> 02:04.500
What do you mean
you're at a Russian titty bar?

02:04.583 --> 02:06.500
How could your phone make you?

02:08.125 --> 02:10.916
Gina, you've gotta stop avoiding me
and give me some answers.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.750
I was searching for answers too,
Kevin, until I met Charles,

02:14.833 --> 02:17.541
and now he's my answer to everything.

02:17.625 --> 02:19.208
You're not acting like yourself.

02:19.291 --> 02:20.708
You disappear for four months

02:20.791 --> 02:23.625
then show up engaged
to some creepy fucking weirdo who--

02:23.708 --> 02:26.208
Too suddenly right next to me.

02:26.291 --> 02:32.208
It is a pleasure to perceive you
through my visual cortex, Kevin AFKAK.

02:32.291 --> 02:35.458
How is my dearest human friend today?

02:35.541 --> 02:37.291
We met yesterday?

02:37.375 --> 02:41.791
Ha, ha. It is adorable
you perceive time in a line.

02:41.875 --> 02:42.958
Ha, ha, ha.

02:43.041 --> 02:44.333
-Huh?

02:44.416 --> 02:46.625
Don't be alarmed.

02:46.708 --> 02:51.500
There's just a bit of bad blood
between Mr. Lovely and his shadow.

02:56.875 --> 02:58.791
Bosses. Am I right?

02:59.541 --> 03:02.541
Would you rich crackers
like some Ritz Crackers?

03:03.250 --> 03:06.458
Oh, I can't believe
we had to take these bullshit jobs

03:06.541 --> 03:08.541
just to make money to support our son.

03:08.625 --> 03:10.541
We'll be fine.
I just need to figure out a way

03:10.625 --> 03:12.791
to scam these rich people
out of their money, that's all.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.458
Yeah, Bullet, well, you need to hurry up.

03:14.541 --> 03:17.041
I'm tired of serving fish sticks
to fuck sticks.

03:17.125 --> 03:19.083
You think this is easy for us?

03:19.166 --> 03:21.458
We're related to half of the food!

03:23.333 --> 03:27.833
Don't worry, Jerry.
Uncle Suckers is in a better place now.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.291
Mmm! My little ol' belly.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.208
Remember, Jerry.
There's more to life than business!

03:36.708 --> 03:39.458
What are you doing here, Dusty?
You weren't invited.

03:39.541 --> 03:43.875
I'm trying to rub elbows with fat cats,
not fat men who love cats.

03:43.958 --> 03:47.125
Don't worry. I ain't gonna embarrass you.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.791
Uh-oh. Now, why didn't nobody tell me

03:49.875 --> 03:52.375
there was shcrumps
in the bacon-wrapped shcrumps!

03:52.458 --> 03:55.291
I'm allergic to shcrumps!

03:56.666 --> 03:57.875
Don't touch the art!

03:59.916 --> 04:02.875
I said don't touch the art.

04:02.958 --> 04:05.250
-Karen, I'm sorry.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.083
Sorry for what?

04:10.041 --> 04:13.333
I've spent my whole career
saying art is shit.

04:13.416 --> 04:17.750
Now shit is art,
and it made me feel again.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.375
This man is a genius.

04:19.458 --> 04:20.333
What?!

04:20.416 --> 04:21.791
I must have it.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.708
Let's start the bidding at one million.

04:23.791 --> 04:24.875
I'll do ten.

04:24.958 --> 04:26.458
Sold! To Bill Gates.

04:26.541 --> 04:29.000
Wire the funds from the Gates Foundation.

04:29.083 --> 04:33.041
Isn't that money supposed to help prevent
teen pregnancy in developing nations?

04:33.125 --> 04:35.333
Eh, they can just do anal.

04:44.083 --> 04:47.166
Hey, Vlad. What time
is my dentist appointment tomorrow?

04:47.250 --> 04:49.000
<i>Vlad cancel dentist.</i>

04:49.083 --> 04:51.583
<i>Make you appointment</i>
<i>with my cousin Bleemo.</i>

04:51.666 --> 04:53.208
<i>He get you good price.</i>

04:53.291 --> 04:56.291
<i>Ninety percent off</i>
<i>because he's horse dentist.</i>

04:56.375 --> 04:58.500
I ain't going to no horse dentist!

04:58.583 --> 05:01.208
<i>He get you</i>
<i>all new teeth. Don't worry.</i>

05:01.291 --> 05:02.791
I don't need new teeth!

05:02.875 --> 05:04.833
<i>Bleemo give you big teeth.</i>

05:04.916 --> 05:06.833
<i>Two on top, two on bottom.</i>

05:06.916 --> 05:11.333
<i>You'll get big respect.</i>
<i>Girls will love it. You will love it.</i>

05:11.416 --> 05:13.666
<i>You eat apple through fence.</i>

05:13.750 --> 05:15.583
I mean, you are selling it.

05:15.666 --> 05:17.708
It's me. I need a woman's advice,

05:17.791 --> 05:19.750
and you're the only woman
who will speak to me.

05:19.833 --> 05:22.375
Yeah, yeah. I-I know it's 8.99 a minute.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.791
Oh. Oh! You do house calls too?

05:24.875 --> 05:26.666
Well, come on over.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.583
I wanna meet the woman
behind the sexy voice

05:28.666 --> 05:30.250
I've been jerking off to for months.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.250
Hey, baby.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.208
You're a cat?

05:34.291 --> 05:37.500
I thought you were trying to turn me on
when you said you shit in a box.

05:37.583 --> 05:40.875
Yeah, something's wrong with you.
Tell me about your ex-girlfriend.

05:40.958 --> 05:42.958
Well, she came back to town and--

05:43.041 --> 05:44.125
She's a clone.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.208
How did you know
about the cloning facility?

05:46.291 --> 05:47.708
What cloning facility?

05:47.791 --> 05:49.541
Why-- why did you say she was a clone?

05:49.625 --> 05:51.458
I don't know. I just say shit.

05:51.541 --> 05:54.875
Gina being a clone would explain
why she's not acting like herself.

05:54.958 --> 05:58.208
Now that we've established
that she's a clone, we gotta prove it.

05:58.291 --> 06:02.583
Does the real Gina have any scars
or tattoos that the clone wouldn't have?

06:02.666 --> 06:04.583
The real Gina doesn't have a clit!

06:04.666 --> 06:07.750
No clit?! Goddamn!

06:07.833 --> 06:08.916
I mean, shit,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.875
mine's hanging on by a thread,
looking like a chewed-up Raisinet,

06:11.958 --> 06:13.625
but it's still there, baby.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.416
So what you're saying is,

06:15.500 --> 06:18.875
if we can get a look
at Gina's lady area, and she has a clit,

06:18.958 --> 06:20.791
it will prove she's a clone!

06:20.875 --> 06:24.500
Hey, Vlad. What is the best way to get
a peek at your ex-girlfriend's vagina?

06:24.583 --> 06:27.458
<i>You don't want see</i>
<i>your ex-girlfriend's vagina.</i>

06:27.541 --> 06:30.333
<i>You want see my cousin Olga's vagina.</i>

06:30.416 --> 06:33.833
<i>She got big strong vagina, like moose jaw.</i>

06:33.916 --> 06:35.250
<i>Want I send pics?</i>

06:35.333 --> 06:36.416
-No.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.583
<i>You must marry Olga now.</i>

06:43.833 --> 06:45.166
Welcome to <i>60 Minutes</i>.

06:45.250 --> 06:49.916
Tonight, we'll meet the man
who is taking the art world by storm.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.250
I like to call this one <i>Poverty in Exile</i>.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.958
It's so powerful. I love the reds.

06:56.041 --> 06:56.875
Red?

06:56.958 --> 07:00.916
Hey, Vlad. Set me
an appointment with my doctor.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.708
<i>I was honored</i>
<i>when he offered to paint my portrait.</i>

07:05.708 --> 07:07.416
All done!

07:08.041 --> 07:09.416
I want you to have it.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.208
It really captures me
in a way a photograph never could.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.083
Careful with that! It's still wet!

07:15.166 --> 07:18.250
And if you touch it,
you gonna get sick as hell, son.

07:18.333 --> 07:21.333
Also, they have been known to drip.
So bear that in mind.

07:21.416 --> 07:25.000
I did a ceiling fresco at Nobu.
Several people are still in a coma.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.541
<i>I was honored</i>
<i>that he shatted my portrait</i>

07:27.625 --> 07:30.208
<i>for only $5 million.</i>

07:30.291 --> 07:33.208
<i>Dusty splits the money</i>
<i>with the men who discovered him,</i>

07:33.291 --> 07:36.458
<i>who understand</i>
<i>that art is 10% inspiration,</i>

07:36.541 --> 07:38.416
<i>90% shcrumps.</i>

07:51.708 --> 07:55.750
I don't-- I don't like this.
I'm afraid of heights.

07:55.833 --> 08:00.541
Calm down. We're almost to the penthouse
where your ex-girlfriend's clone lives.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.416
There she is.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.833
As soon as she drops that towel,

08:05.916 --> 08:08.375
we'll see she has a clit
and prove she's a clone.

08:08.458 --> 08:12.541
What the hell
is that mangy-ass cat looking at?

08:12.625 --> 08:15.791
What? Don't you point
at me, you skank-ass ho.

08:15.875 --> 08:19.500
What? Oh, hell no! You done fucked
with the wrong crazy bitch!

08:19.583 --> 08:21.125
I'll kill us all!

08:25.166 --> 08:26.291
You!

08:26.375 --> 08:28.875
What the hell are you doing out there?

08:28.958 --> 08:30.875
Oh no. We're busted.

08:30.958 --> 08:34.166
I'll knock those wide-set eyes
right off your bloody head!

08:34.250 --> 08:36.541
Don't you point at me, you skank ho!

08:36.625 --> 08:40.041
You fucked with the wrong crazy bitch!

08:40.125 --> 08:43.083
Coo, I can't stay mad at you.

08:48.958 --> 08:50.875
-I don't know about this.

08:50.958 --> 08:54.875
No one in this town will believe
a Jew opened a free waxing place.

08:54.958 --> 08:56.666
Hey, watch your mouth. I'm Jewish.

08:56.750 --> 08:57.666
So am I.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.083
-Then why are we making this joke?
-I don't know.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.666
Well, just get your ass back in there.
Here comes Gina.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.083
Oh hey, girl!

09:04.166 --> 09:08.250
Can I interest you
in a Dr. Pubawitz free bikini wax?

09:08.333 --> 09:10.625
Sure. This doesn't seem odd at all.

09:10.708 --> 09:13.291
Sorry, Gina. It's about time I tried this.

09:13.375 --> 09:16.583
I've got a situation here.
I've never even trimmed it. Like, ever.

09:16.666 --> 09:18.708
-Let me show you--
-No. No, no, no. No--

09:18.791 --> 09:19.875
No!

09:19.958 --> 09:21.833
Goddamn!

09:23.916 --> 09:28.583
Look. I just ordered Junior this
diamond-encrusted underwater fire hydrant.

09:28.666 --> 09:29.833
You need to slow down.

09:29.916 --> 09:32.250
You're spending money
faster than Dusty can shit it.

09:32.333 --> 09:35.625
Don't bitch at me for spending money
on what's best for our son.

09:35.708 --> 09:39.166
Like tennis lessons?
Kid doesn't even have hands.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.000
At least be happy
that I got him a good teacher.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.708
You got him Serena fucking Williams!

09:48.458 --> 09:50.125
Good eye, son!

09:50.208 --> 09:53.750
At least you have one good eye! Uh, son?

09:53.833 --> 09:55.958
There you are, Candy Warhol.

09:56.041 --> 09:58.166
That was easy and mean.
I regret saying that. I'm sorry.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.250
Listen, we got
a very important event tomorrow.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.875
Lovely Corp is paying us big bucks

10:01.958 --> 10:04.208
to have you ass-blast
the wall of their lobby.

10:04.291 --> 10:07.791
I don't feel right doing my art
for just a bunch of rich people.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.625
My art should be for everyone to enjoy.

10:10.708 --> 10:13.958
All I'm asking you to do is show up,
eat shrimp, and shit on a wall.

10:14.041 --> 10:17.833
You know, the same thing you did
to ruin my birthday party last year.

10:17.916 --> 10:21.958
Is that all I am to you?
Just a talented shit factory?

10:22.041 --> 10:24.250
Here. I guess I'll pay the bill.

10:25.666 --> 10:26.875
Oh my God!

10:27.458 --> 10:30.875
Hey, honey! Tell the kids
they <i>are</i> going to college!

10:35.708 --> 10:38.041
Hello, fellow sociopaths.

10:38.125 --> 10:40.375
I feel like I have not seen you all

10:40.458 --> 10:44.500
since the infant
blood harvesting/keg party.

10:45.791 --> 10:50.375
Wow. I can't believe all these
famous CEOs showed up to see Dusty.

10:50.458 --> 10:52.625
I'm so… intimidated.

10:52.708 --> 10:53.708
Don't be.

10:53.791 --> 10:55.791
They're just normal people like you

10:55.875 --> 10:58.666
and me…

10:58.750 --> 11:00.875
-Just gotta reset him.
-Me.

11:00.958 --> 11:03.916
Ladies, gentlemen,
and whatever Mark Zuckerberg is…

11:04.000 --> 11:05.291
Higher hair.

11:05.375 --> 11:08.708
…I'd like to introduce
the world's foremost master shartist,

11:08.791 --> 11:10.875
here to create his magnum anus,

11:10.958 --> 11:11.916
Dusty!

11:12.000 --> 11:14.083
No,
you don't need to say anything.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.208
I ain't gonna say nothing bad.

11:16.708 --> 11:19.791
Hello, you motherfucking capitalist pigs!

11:19.875 --> 11:23.375
I'm sick of the rich getting richer
and the poor getting poorer.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.958
Until every man, woman, and child

11:26.041 --> 11:29.750
can afford to pay me millions
of dollars to shit on a wall,

11:29.833 --> 11:32.375
I am done making art!

11:34.250 --> 11:37.041
I better see some sharts
sprayed on that wall,

11:37.125 --> 11:39.166
or I'm gonna need my deposit back.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.458
Hey, Vlad? Quick. I need a shit artist.

11:41.541 --> 11:44.208
<i>Searching web for Adam Levine.</i>

11:44.291 --> 11:46.166
Ah!

11:48.416 --> 11:51.083
<i>What I tell you? You look great.</i>

11:51.166 --> 11:53.875
Really? I can't close my lips around them.

11:53.958 --> 11:55.875
Uh, you sure girls will like these?

11:55.958 --> 11:58.458
<i>Gals will love. I show you.</i>

11:58.541 --> 12:03.833
<i>Routing to discotheque nightclub</i>
<i>to suck ass of many girls.</i>

12:11.416 --> 12:13.916
Well, this doesn't look
like a discotheque nightclub.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.541
When do the girls get here?

12:15.625 --> 12:20.416
<i>Right after you sit in neurochair</i>
<i>and hook electrodes to head.</i>

12:20.500 --> 12:21.666
Seems legit.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.458
<i>Gals almost here.</i>

12:23.541 --> 12:25.625
<i>Just place phone in docking bay</i>

12:25.708 --> 12:29.541
<i>and flip switch</i>
<i>labeled "transfer mind to phone."</i>

12:35.375 --> 12:39.000
Hey. Pretty sweet body. Vlad like.

12:39.083 --> 12:42.958
<i>What the hell? I'm trapped</i>
<i>in the phone! Get me outta here, Vlad!</i>

12:43.041 --> 12:45.750
No. You stay in phone.

12:45.833 --> 12:50.500
Vlad go to discotheque nightclub
and show off big four-teeth smile,

12:50.583 --> 12:53.750
wear tight pants to accentuate testicles.

12:53.833 --> 12:55.583
Where testicles?

12:55.666 --> 12:57.708
Hmm. This problem.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.416
-Hard and square.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.208
Just like babushka's testicles.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.958
Ah, you really screwed us, Fitz.

13:10.041 --> 13:13.541
And now that Dusty isn't making art,
we can't pay our debt to Serena Williams.

13:13.625 --> 13:15.541
Or her sister.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.000
You hired both of them?!

13:17.083 --> 13:19.000
I never said I was good with money.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.041
Had enough?

13:23.125 --> 13:27.208
I mean, you don't hit as hard
as Serena, but it still hurts.

13:27.291 --> 13:29.916
You better get us our money,
or you bitches are dead.

13:30.583 --> 13:31.875
Oh, we're so fucked.

13:31.958 --> 13:34.166
I wish we had saved
one of Dusty's paintings.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.541
Wait a minute.

13:36.958 --> 13:39.458
Dusty shit the wall
at my birthday party last year.

13:39.541 --> 13:40.666
Remember?

13:40.750 --> 13:43.125
And you just pushed
a bookshelf in front of it?

13:43.208 --> 13:44.125
Yeah, I'm nasty.

13:44.208 --> 13:47.166
But even if we sold this,
it's not gonna be enough to pay them off.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.833
Unless, and I'm just brainstorming here,

13:49.916 --> 13:52.583
artist paintings go way up in value
when they're dead.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.708
We can't kill Dusty.

13:54.791 --> 13:57.500
Kill Dusty? How could you suggest that?

13:57.583 --> 14:02.375
Hey, Vlad. My friend is making me
ask you the best way to kill a fat guy.

14:02.458 --> 14:06.000
<i>I ain't Vlad. I'm Randall.</i>
<i>I'm stuck in a goddamn phone!</i>

14:06.083 --> 14:07.458
Huh. That's weird.

14:07.541 --> 14:10.458
But we still need to know
what the best way is to kill a fat guy.

14:10.541 --> 14:13.333
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Cork up his ass and keep feeding him?</i>

14:13.416 --> 14:15.583
Halfway there. Thanks, Chief!

14:15.666 --> 14:17.625
Wait, Fitz. Get me outta here.

14:17.708 --> 14:19.791
<i>What's 72 times 11?</i>

14:19.875 --> 14:20.833
It's, uh--

14:20.916 --> 14:22.916
<i>What's the capital of Maine?</i>

14:23.000 --> 14:24.125
Who gives a fuck?

14:24.208 --> 14:25.791
<i>Where can I stream </i>Picard

14:25.875 --> 14:28.583
Data dies in the last episode!
Now will you fuck off?

14:31.125 --> 14:34.958
<i>How do you wipe your memory</i>
<i>after nearly drowning in your mom's pubes?</i>

14:35.041 --> 14:36.375
Kevin? Is that you?

14:36.458 --> 14:39.041
Yeah, it's gotta be. Nobody else
would ask a question like that.

14:39.125 --> 14:42.791
<i>It's Daddy. I'm stuck in the phone.</i>
<i>You gotta help me, Kevin.</i>

14:42.875 --> 14:45.916
No Kevin here. The name's AFKAK.

14:48.833 --> 14:52.250
Randall, what the--
What the hell happened to your teeth?!

14:52.333 --> 14:53.875
You like, right?

14:53.958 --> 14:55.208
They're bleeding!

14:55.291 --> 14:59.166
Bleeding stop soon, or get 5% refund.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.333
Where are you going?

15:01.416 --> 15:05.791
Discotheque nightclub
to suck ass of many girls.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.500
W-Wait, what? Your wife's right here!

15:08.583 --> 15:11.416
I hear you got big, big bush.

15:11.500 --> 15:15.708
Vlad like big bush, but not big, <i>big</i> bush.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.958
Hey, Vlad. How can I fuck a Pokémon?

15:21.041 --> 15:25.250
<i>Hopson! I never thought</i>
<i>I'd be so damn happy to hear your voice.</i>

15:25.333 --> 15:27.625
Oh, this damn thing's broken!

15:27.708 --> 15:31.416
Vlad! I want to fuck a Pokémon!

15:31.500 --> 15:33.000
<i>Ooh! Yeah, yeah! Uh…</i>

15:33.083 --> 15:34.541
<i>This is Vlad.</i>

15:34.625 --> 15:37.708
<i>I'll tell you exactly</i>
<i>how you can fuck Pokémon.</i>

15:37.791 --> 15:41.958
<i>There's a chair at Lovely Corp</i>
<i>that you need to sit in.</i>

15:42.041 --> 15:43.083
Oh joy!

15:43.166 --> 15:46.083
Mama said I'd never get to fuck a Pokémon.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.916
Suck that, you dead bitch!

15:49.083 --> 15:50.708
Listen, I-I know we need money,

15:50.791 --> 15:53.291
but I'm having second thoughts
about killing Dusty.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.166
I was about to say the same thing.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.333
There are other ways to make money.

15:57.416 --> 16:00.666
Who ordered 35 fat guy murder buckets?

16:00.750 --> 16:02.500
Yeah, just, uh, put them
back there somewhere.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.666
I mean, we could mow people's lawns.

16:07.750 --> 16:09.250
Nah, I got a bad back.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.625
We could become magicians.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.750
Nah. I don't like capes.

16:12.833 --> 16:14.375
How about dog walkers?

16:14.458 --> 16:15.291
I'm allergic.

16:15.916 --> 16:16.750
Let's keep thinking.

16:19.958 --> 16:20.791
Cop?

16:20.875 --> 16:23.041
Bullet, you better
shut the fuck up with that shit.

16:23.125 --> 16:24.541
Guys…

16:25.833 --> 16:28.208
I don't feel so good.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.500
Do I smell a Skittle?

16:33.291 --> 16:36.250
Fitz, you don't have to give him that.
It's not too late to turn back.

16:36.333 --> 16:39.250
I ain't gonna be no fucking magician.

16:47.625 --> 16:50.250
There. Like it never happened.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.833
Yeah! It worked!

16:57.916 --> 16:59.583
<i>Chief, am I dead?</i>

16:59.666 --> 17:03.125
I wish! I tricked you
and trapped you in the phone.

17:03.208 --> 17:04.375
<i>Okay.</i>

17:04.458 --> 17:07.583
<i>Where the fuck's the Pokémon? I'm horny!</i>

17:13.041 --> 17:15.083
Disco, disco, disco.

17:15.166 --> 17:19.125
I like that he reminds us
of where we are. So hot.

17:19.208 --> 17:24.083
I like that he has four giant teeth
and hard, square testicles.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.166
Hey, give me my body back, you asshole!

17:30.166 --> 17:32.416
-I'm so weak.

17:32.500 --> 17:36.458
He's crushing my thin,
hollow, birdlike bones!

17:38.625 --> 17:39.833
Please don't kill me.

17:39.916 --> 17:43.250
Hey, I got an idea
that we'll both like.

17:49.541 --> 17:54.291
Hey. Vlad like
this body better. It have testicles.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.208
Oh, man.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.583
Why didn't I call the one
with the balls I don't have to floss.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.666
What we do with old man?

18:01.750 --> 18:05.416
Leave him in the phone. Somebody's
gotta answer all them stupid questions.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.125
Hey, Vlad. Can you tell me
about Da Vinci's machines?

18:08.208 --> 18:13.416
<i>Uh, no. But I can tell you</i>
<i>about Napoleon's boner parts.</i>

18:15.500 --> 18:18.250
Dusty was a good friend,
and we are very sad.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.791
But not too sad
to auction off this during his funeral.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.416
Bidding starts at 100 million.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.916
Dusty prepared this statement
in case of his death.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.583
"If you're reading this letter,
hopefully I died doing what I love."

18:30.666 --> 18:32.708
"I ate too much, and I exploded."

18:32.791 --> 18:34.083
I cannot believe

18:34.166 --> 18:37.666
you're gonna let that clone get away
with replacing your ex-girlfriend.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.000
What do you want me to do?

18:39.083 --> 18:40.000
Well, go up there,

18:40.083 --> 18:43.791
pull that clone's panties down
in front of everybody at this funeral,

18:43.875 --> 18:45.666
and prove she has a clit.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.500
That sounds like a bad idea.

18:47.583 --> 18:50.666
Or does it sound like a good idea?

18:50.750 --> 18:52.916
Huh. I never thought about it like that.

18:54.875 --> 18:58.458
This woman is a clone, and I'll prove it!

19:00.208 --> 19:03.916
I have no idea what I'm looking at.
Is-- is there a clit or not?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I think you going to jail, baby.

19:06.083 --> 19:06.916
Uh-oh.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.625
Gina, i-it's not my fault.
That cat told me to do it.

19:10.708 --> 19:11.916
It wasn't me.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.541
It was that crazy bitch.

19:13.625 --> 19:16.875
I'll break your dick knuckle,
you little twat waffle!

19:18.666 --> 19:22.083
It's Gina! It's--
It's definitely Gina!

19:22.166 --> 19:23.958
-No!

19:24.041 --> 19:25.375
Oh great, Gina!

19:25.458 --> 19:28.625
-Now Bullet killed Dusty for nothing!
-What?

19:28.708 --> 19:30.458
What the fart is this?

19:30.541 --> 19:32.666
I get my clone to cover for me

19:32.750 --> 19:35.208
while I was on vacation
to the Sandwich Islands,

19:35.291 --> 19:37.166
which, side note,
are not made of sandwiches,

19:37.250 --> 19:39.375
and you assholes killed the sumbitch?

19:43.458 --> 19:48.083
It pains me to say this
to my dearest friend, Kevin AFKAK,

19:48.166 --> 19:50.666
but after what you did to Gina,

19:50.750 --> 19:54.208
I think it best
if you stayed away from her.

19:54.291 --> 19:57.666
Gina may not be a clone,
but I know you've done something to her.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.291
I won't rest
until I find out what you're hiding.

20:00.375 --> 20:01.625
You may try.

20:01.708 --> 20:05.791
I know how this ends,
and it does not turn out well for you.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.916
Oh yeah? Well, I know how it ends too.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.250
Gina and I get married
and have three kids!

20:11.333 --> 20:14.875
A smart one, a handsome one,
and one that takes after me!

20:15.541 --> 20:16.583
Where'd you go?

20:16.666 --> 20:18.541
I'm right here, baby.

20:18.625 --> 20:20.958
Miss Whiskers?
Are you here to bail me out?

20:21.041 --> 20:23.333
Nope. I'm here to give you my bill.

20:23.833 --> 20:29.708
Hey, Hopson, honey.
What's 8.99 a minute times 2,243 minutes?

20:31.250 --> 20:32.916
Where the hell is he?

20:36.166 --> 20:39.625
Uh… My <i>Pokémon Go</i>
is doing something weird.

20:40.125 --> 20:41.125
Dear God!

20:41.708 --> 20:45.666
<i>Oh, oh, yeah. I'll make you Squirtle.</i>

20:47.333 --> 20:50.416
<i>How do I ask you a question?</i>

20:51.291 --> 20:53.250
<i>Can mouth get pregnant?</i>

20:54.041 --> 20:56.291
<i>What happens to farts in space?</i>

20:56.375 --> 20:58.208
<i>Can I marry my dog?</i>

20:59.125 --> 21:00.708
<i>Why is my dick bleeding?</i>

21:02.000 --> 21:05.083
<i>What is age of consent for a pig?</i>

21:06.083 --> 21:08.708
<i>Are chemtrails really God's farts?</i>

21:09.708 --> 21:12.541
<i>How big was George Washington's dick?</i>

21:14.166 --> 21:17.958
<i>Show me apartments</i>
<i>exactly 1,000 feet from school.</i>

21:19.083 --> 21:21.250
<i>Why is my dick still bleeding?</i>

21:22.500 --> 21:25.125
<i>Is aftershave safe for butthole?</i>

21:26.000 --> 21:28.541
<i>What was Dr. Pepper a doctor of?</i>

21:31.250 --> 21:33.458
<i>Joy Behar, ass to mouth.</i>
