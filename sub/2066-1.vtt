00:40.795 --> 00:43.130
Let's keep those hammers working!

01:02.525 --> 01:04.110
Rambo!

01:07.071 --> 01:07.905
Let's go.

01:30.511 --> 01:32.263
How are you, Johnny?

01:33.264 --> 01:34.265
Good.

01:36.100 --> 01:36.976
That's all.

01:40.771 --> 01:45.443
I'm sorry they sent you to such
a hellhole. - I've seen worse.

01:45.943 --> 01:47.778
Yeah, you have, haven't you...

01:48.904 --> 01:53.451
I told you that I'd help you
when I could. Are you interested?

01:56.871 --> 02:01.250
You can't possibly want
to stay here for another five years.

02:07.882 --> 02:12.553
In here at least I know where I stand.
- Just hear me out first.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.682
A covert operation
is being geared up in the Far East.

02:17.141 --> 02:21.812
A computer gave your name as one of
3 suitable candidates for the mission.

02:23.606 --> 02:26.525
Mission?
- A hunt for POWs in Vietnam.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.491
Why now? Why me?

02:35.493 --> 02:38.204
The prison camp you escaped from in '71
is the target area.

02:38.704 --> 02:43.125
No one knows that terrain better
than you. The risk factor's very high.

02:43.626 --> 02:47.088
You'd be temporarily reinstated in the
forces, and if the mission's successful,

02:47.546 --> 02:50.216
there may be a presidential pardon.

02:51.842 --> 02:53.928
You interested?

03:00.601 --> 03:01.852
Yeah.

03:02.311 --> 03:06.357
Good. I'll get the necessary clearance.

03:07.775 --> 03:11.529
The next time we meet will be in
Thailand with the special ops designate.

03:11.987 --> 03:13.114
Yes, sir.

03:13.572 --> 03:15.449
All clear?
- Yes, sir.

03:15.950 --> 03:18.619
I want you to know I did
what I could to keep you out of here.

03:19.537 --> 03:20.746
I know.

03:25.376 --> 03:27.837
Do we get to win this time?

03:28.796 --> 03:30.464
This time it's up to you.

05:45.349 --> 05:47.017
That'll be all.

05:48.394 --> 05:52.982
How're you doing, Rambo? I'm Ericson.
Why don't we make it over to the hangar?

05:55.568 --> 05:57.987
You're the chosen one, ha?

05:58.446 --> 06:01.782
You made
a helluva rep for yourself in 'nam.

06:02.283 --> 06:04.744
I'm glad to be working with you.

06:05.202 --> 06:09.874
This place may not be heaven,
but at least you're out of the joint.

06:14.295 --> 06:15.296
He's here.

06:18.966 --> 06:20.301
Morning, John.

06:21.052 --> 06:23.929
This is Marshal Murdock.
He's in charge of special operations.

06:24.430 --> 06:26.098
Thank you, Colonel. Rambo,

06:26.599 --> 06:29.477
been looking forward to meeting you.
How was your trip? No problems? - No.

06:29.977 --> 06:33.022
Except for the damned heat, right?
I've never felt anything like it.

06:33.481 --> 06:35.941
Come on in,
let's get down to business.

06:37.526 --> 06:41.072
I was glancing over your files.

06:41.572 --> 06:44.367
Makes pretty interesting reading.

06:49.538 --> 06:54.794
Rambo, John J., born 7.6.47, Bowie,
Arizona, of Indian-German descent.

06:55.252 --> 06:58.839
That's a helluva combination.
Joined the army 6.8.64,

06:59.298 --> 07:02.176
accepted special forces,
specialization: Light weapons.

07:03.010 --> 07:05.179
Cross-trained as medic.
Helicopter and language qualified.

07:05.638 --> 07:10.226
59 confirmed kills, 2 silver stars,
4 bronze, 4 Purple Hearts,

07:10.726 --> 07:12.061
Medal of Honor.

07:13.312 --> 07:18.943
You got around, didn't you?
Incredible. Rambo, you're probably aware

07:19.443 --> 07:22.863
that there are almost 2,500 Americans
still missing in action in SE Asia.

07:23.364 --> 07:27.785
Most are presumed dead, but for the
families, Congress and many Americans

07:28.244 --> 07:30.538
it's still an emotional issue.

07:31.038 --> 07:32.331
Give me something cold, please!

07:33.374 --> 07:37.753
Rambo, you certainly don't know
as much about me as I do you.

07:38.212 --> 07:41.298
I've honched with the 2nd Battalion,
3rd Marines, in Kon Tum in '66.

07:41.799 --> 07:45.261
I lost a lot of good men,
so I know what you and every vet feels.

07:45.761 --> 07:50.099
Maybe the government and certain
segments of the population didn't care,

07:51.058 --> 07:55.813
but my committee cares. - It needs
proof that Americans are there.

07:56.272 --> 07:57.690
Then we'll get 'em back.

07:58.149 --> 08:03.487
If there are any of our men at the POW
target camp, you're to take photos.

08:04.864 --> 08:07.992
Photos?
- Only photos. Under no circumstances

08:08.451 --> 08:12.788
are you to engage the enemy.
- I'm supposed to leave them there?

08:13.289 --> 08:16.083
I repeat:
Do not engage the enemy!

08:16.542 --> 08:20.421
The assault team led by Colonel Trautman
will handle the extraction.

08:26.969 --> 08:31.640
With your participation,
this mission has a better than average

08:32.099 --> 08:33.851
chance of succeeding.

08:35.311 --> 08:39.315
I'll meet you both
in the operations center in one hour.

08:56.540 --> 08:59.794
From Thailand across Laos
into the mountains of Vietnam.

09:00.252 --> 09:03.297
You'll be flying a ceiling
of 250 feet when you bail out.

09:03.798 --> 09:06.634
Think you can handle it?
- I'll try.

09:07.093 --> 09:11.347
Since you're going in solo, you'll have
to take more equipment than ever before.

09:11.806 --> 09:15.559
And use it!
Don't try the blood-and-guts routine.

09:16.060 --> 09:18.646
Let technology do most of the work.

09:19.105 --> 09:24.026
Forget the war. Remember the mission.
The old Vietnam is dead.

09:24.527 --> 09:28.614
Sir, I'm alive,
so it's still alive, isn't it?

09:39.166 --> 09:42.211
You may find this hard
to believe, but all this is for you.

09:42.670 --> 09:44.130
Impressed?

09:44.630 --> 09:50.720
You'll get every modern piece of
equipment we have to ensure your safety.

09:51.178 --> 09:55.015
You can feel totally safe because we
have the world's most advanced weapons.

09:57.560 --> 10:01.689
I've always believed that the mind's
the best weapon. - Times change.

10:02.231 --> 10:03.441
For some people.

10:05.067 --> 10:06.277
Don't let me interrupt.

10:06.777 --> 10:09.155
Upon insertion
call in to base camp on Transat.

10:09.655 --> 10:15.202
Then proceed to rendezvous with your
ground contact, indigenous agent Co Bao.

10:15.661 --> 10:17.705
Is he listening?

10:18.164 --> 10:20.875
Indigenous agent Co Bao.

10:28.299 --> 10:29.592
Colonel!

10:30.801 --> 10:32.887
Are you sure he's not unbalanced?

10:33.387 --> 10:38.267
What if he cracks under the pressure
in that hell? - Pressure?

10:39.226 --> 10:41.687
Rambo is the best combat vet
I've ever seen.

10:42.146 --> 10:46.359
A pure fighting machine with only
a desire to win a war someone else lost.

10:46.817 --> 10:51.989
If winning means he has to die,
he'll die. No fear, no regrets.

10:53.616 --> 10:55.284
And one more thing:

10:55.785 --> 10:59.663
What you call "hell", he calls home.

11:03.376 --> 11:05.628
Stand by! Start A.P.U.!

11:29.652 --> 11:31.362
D minus 20.

12:03.602 --> 12:04.979
D minus 5.

12:20.953 --> 12:26.042
You've got 36 hours to get in and out.
So don't stop to smell the roses, okay?

12:27.001 --> 12:32.965
If you run into trouble, try to get
to the hilltop extraction site.

12:38.763 --> 12:40.431
Good luck, son.
- Thanks.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.433
Ready to roll.

12:45.061 --> 12:49.440
Murdock said he'd been
with the 2nd Battalion in Kon Tum '66.

12:50.775 --> 12:53.194
The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.

12:55.071 --> 12:56.989
You're the only one that I trust.

13:38.823 --> 13:42.952
Think he'll find someone?
- POWs? Doubtful.

13:43.411 --> 13:47.998
But there are people to satisfy,
questions that have to be answered.

13:48.499 --> 13:51.836
You don't sound too emotional about it.
- It wasn't my war, Colonel.

13:52.294 --> 13:54.755
I'm here to clean up the mess.

14:38.257 --> 14:39.967
K-Wok 2-5 is raft.

14:40.468 --> 14:42.053
They're holding timeline.

14:42.553 --> 14:44.889
Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.

15:19.340 --> 15:21.342
We're back in the badlands, my man.

15:22.468 --> 15:24.178
Stand by your position!

15:24.678 --> 15:27.765
Insertion in 15 seconds.
- Partytime!

15:41.028 --> 15:42.029
5 seconds.

16:00.548 --> 16:03.134
What's happening?
- He's hung up!

16:05.720 --> 16:07.513
He'll be torn apart!

16:09.515 --> 16:12.893
He's hung up! - What do you mean he's
hung up? - He's being dragged!

16:15.938 --> 16:17.898
Cut him loose!
- I can't free him!

16:39.503 --> 16:42.673
Abort the mission!
- That'll kill him! He'll be torn apart!

16:46.135 --> 16:48.054
He's cutting away his equipment.

16:59.732 --> 17:01.317
He's out!

17:01.817 --> 17:05.988
Here is Dragonfly 1. Do you read me?
- Dragonfly 1, I read you.

17:06.489 --> 17:10.034
Any visual bearing by flares?
- Negative. We didn't see anything.

17:17.791 --> 17:23.881
Maybe it's best to abort
the mission now. Who could survive that?

17:24.339 --> 17:26.092
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

17:26.550 --> 17:31.097
He's got 36 hours to complete the
mission and reach the extraction point.

17:31.555 --> 17:34.475
We owe him that.
- Of course we do.

17:35.434 --> 17:40.272
But understand something:
In 36 hours we pull out.

19:24.460 --> 19:25.628
Rambo!

19:39.975 --> 19:42.144
You did not expect a woman, no?

19:44.522 --> 19:46.148
We'd better go.

19:48.984 --> 19:53.406
We go to river.
How come you so late?

19:53.864 --> 19:55.408
I was hung up.

20:01.205 --> 20:05.376
I have arranged boat to take us
down river. Old ways not safe.

20:05.835 --> 20:09.839
You come a long way, Rambo,
to see empty camp.

21:02.725 --> 21:04.185
You're using pirates?

21:04.685 --> 21:09.815
Best way down river.
Not get army suspicious.

22:29.770 --> 22:32.064
What about patrol boats?

22:53.252 --> 22:54.628
Russian.

23:22.573 --> 23:23.282
Rambo,

23:24.533 --> 23:26.744
want to eat?

23:27.870 --> 23:29.955
Maybe later.

23:38.756 --> 23:40.424
How you get into this?

23:42.760 --> 23:46.347
It's a long story.
- Long trip.

23:49.308 --> 23:52.561
After I left the special forces,

23:53.062 --> 23:57.316
I moved around a lot.
- Why you leave army?

23:57.817 --> 23:58.984
I...

24:00.695 --> 24:03.030
...came back to the States

24:03.531 --> 24:05.783
and found another war going on.

24:07.118 --> 24:09.245
What war?

24:10.162 --> 24:11.997
Kind of like a quiet war.

24:14.083 --> 24:19.964
A war against the soldiers returning.
The kind of war you don't win.

24:26.095 --> 24:29.098
It's my problem.
How did you get into it?

24:30.725 --> 24:34.770
My father
worked for intelligence agency.

24:35.896 --> 24:39.525
He killed, and I take his place.

24:40.026 --> 24:41.485
There's too much death here.

24:42.486 --> 24:43.654
Death everywhere.

24:47.908 --> 24:49.410
I just want to live.

24:53.205 --> 24:57.209
Maybe go America. Live the quiet life.

25:00.921 --> 25:02.840
What you want?

25:05.051 --> 25:07.720
To win. To survive.

25:09.722 --> 25:13.392
Not so easy to survive. Still war here.

25:13.893 --> 25:17.605
To survive a war,
you've got to become war.

25:18.105 --> 25:21.525
That why they pick you?
Because you like to fight?

25:26.572 --> 25:28.491
I am expendable.

25:31.243 --> 25:32.995
What mean "expendable"?

25:35.373 --> 25:36.415
It's like

25:36.916 --> 25:42.797
someone invites you to a party
and you don't show up,

25:43.255 --> 25:45.257
and it doesn't really matter.

25:52.223 --> 25:53.683
What's this?

25:54.934 --> 25:57.103
It bring me good luck.

25:58.771 --> 26:01.065
What bring you good luck?

26:08.698 --> 26:10.658
I guess this.

26:17.206 --> 26:21.043
No further reports. - I want to go up
with the extraction team at dawn.

26:21.502 --> 26:23.045
Denied.
- Denied?

26:23.546 --> 26:26.215
It's an unnecessary risk.
- We have a schedule to keep.

26:26.674 --> 26:29.093
We don't even know if he's alive.
- Unlikely.

26:29.552 --> 26:31.887
You said we'd go through as planned.

26:33.556 --> 26:37.351
Okay, if you
want to go through with it, we will.

26:37.852 --> 26:40.104
The Colonel's
gonna be joining the extraction team.

26:43.274 --> 26:45.109
You're a damned good man, Trautman.

27:42.541 --> 27:44.960
See? Camp empty.

27:46.087 --> 27:48.089
We move closer.

28:32.591 --> 28:35.052
Cyclo-girl whore from village.

28:39.557 --> 28:40.683
Come on!

28:56.574 --> 28:59.785
What is it?
- A bow. No sound.

29:06.667 --> 29:11.172
You not going in there.
You're supposed to only take pictures.

29:11.672 --> 29:12.882
What about orders?

29:13.883 --> 29:15.301
No more orders, Co.

32:59.025 --> 33:00.484
I've come to get you out.

33:02.153 --> 33:03.779
Don't talk.

33:32.266 --> 33:35.603
There are others.
- I'll be back.

35:15.494 --> 35:16.370
Everything okay?

35:17.163 --> 35:18.706
Let's go!

35:52.073 --> 35:53.824
You have clearance.

35:54.283 --> 35:56.369
Minus one hour to extraction.

35:56.827 --> 35:59.872
I hope for his sake
we're not just wasting fuel.

36:00.373 --> 36:02.375
Let's get moving.

36:24.438 --> 36:26.524
A good thing you came when you did.

36:27.024 --> 36:28.317
Why is that?

36:29.026 --> 36:32.738
They move us around a lot. Because
of the crops. Only been there a week.

36:33.406 --> 36:38.661
When were you last in that camp?
- A year. What year is it, anyway?

36:39.453 --> 36:41.038
1985.

36:44.917 --> 36:47.378
Camp supposed to be empty.

36:48.045 --> 36:49.672
Yes, supposed to be.

37:22.747 --> 37:26.125
Landing zone a mile up river.

38:26.769 --> 38:29.355
What has happened?
- We've been sold out.

38:31.107 --> 38:32.233
You bastard!

39:08.436 --> 39:11.272
Right, jump!
- I fight!

39:11.772 --> 39:13.065
Jump! Go on!

40:08.788 --> 40:10.289
The gunboat!

40:28.349 --> 40:29.225
Jump!

40:41.737 --> 40:43.614
You made it, Rambo!

40:51.872 --> 40:53.040
Come on.

41:17.773 --> 41:20.317
Take this. We go on from here.

41:21.527 --> 41:24.196
Better I stay on to end.
- This is the end.

41:25.906 --> 41:26.699
Come on.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.243
Rambo!

41:30.745 --> 41:32.747
You not expendable.

41:56.228 --> 41:58.356
Colonel, 3 minutes.

43:10.886 --> 43:12.221
That's Rambo!

43:18.853 --> 43:20.229
Christ, he's found one!

43:50.718 --> 43:52.887
Rambo's found one of ours!

43:54.013 --> 43:58.726
The ground crew has what appears to be
an American POW with him.

43:59.727 --> 44:03.022
What did you say?
- They've got one of ours.

44:04.148 --> 44:06.692
Yellow alert!
Meyers, Harrison, Goddell!

44:07.193 --> 44:10.237
Everybody out! Move!

44:10.696 --> 44:12.990
Go to your COMINT frequency!
Give me the mike!

44:15.826 --> 44:20.039
Dragonfly, here is Coach 1.
This is a priority order.

44:21.749 --> 44:23.209
Come on!

44:26.504 --> 44:29.757
Abort the operation immediately!

44:30.257 --> 44:33.719
This is a recall. Confirm. Over.
- Say it again, Coach 1.

44:34.136 --> 44:35.763
Abort the operation!

44:37.098 --> 44:41.060
I've been ordered to abort.
- But we've got them in sight!

44:41.560 --> 44:43.145
Murdock, do you read?

44:47.149 --> 44:50.027
We're going down.
- You're not going anywhere.

44:53.406 --> 44:57.410
You damned mercenaries!
Those are our men down there!

44:58.411 --> 45:01.747
No, your men. Don't be a hero.

45:08.754 --> 45:09.880
Colonel!

45:10.381 --> 45:11.841
Down!

45:52.923 --> 45:56.052
What are you doing?
Do you know what the hell you've done?

45:56.510 --> 45:58.929
Don't act so innocent, Colonel.

45:59.430 --> 46:02.099
You had your suspicions,
which makes you a sort of accessory.

46:02.558 --> 46:05.227
Don't ever
count me with you and your scum!

46:05.728 --> 46:09.899
It was a lie, wasn't it.
Like the whole damned war. It was a lie.

46:10.399 --> 46:11.942
What are you talking about?

46:12.443 --> 46:15.112
That camp was supposed to be empty.

46:16.155 --> 46:20.701
Rambo goes in, finds no POWs,
Congress buys it, case closed.

46:21.202 --> 46:26.540
And if he happens to get caught,
nobody knows except you.

46:26.999 --> 46:29.585
Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

46:30.086 --> 46:36.092
A stinking bureaucrat who's trying to
cover his ass. - A nation's!

46:36.550 --> 46:41.013
Besides, it was your hero's fault. If
he had done what he was meant to do,

46:41.514 --> 46:45.976
we'd be out of this clean and simple.
He was just supposed to take pictures.

46:46.435 --> 46:50.648
And if those pictures showed something,
they'd have been lost.

46:51.107 --> 46:53.609
You still don't understand
what this is all about.

46:54.110 --> 46:56.654
Same as always: Money.

46:57.154 --> 47:00.282
In '72 we were supposed to pay the Cong
4.5 billion in war reparation.

47:00.783 --> 47:03.369
We reneged, they kept the POWs.

47:03.828 --> 47:06.580
And you're doing the same thing
all over again.

47:07.081 --> 47:08.541
What would you do?

47:08.999 --> 47:13.629
Pay ransom for our men and finance
the war effort against our allies?

47:14.088 --> 47:16.757
And if some burnt-out POW
shows up on the 6 o'clock news?

47:17.216 --> 47:22.096
Do you want to start the war over again
and bomb Hanoi?

47:22.555 --> 47:28.519
You think the Senate's going to pay
billions for a few forgotten ghosts?

47:29.020 --> 47:32.732
For men! Men who fought
for their country! - That's enough!

47:34.191 --> 47:38.904
Trautman, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place.

47:40.573 --> 47:43.242
You bastard!
- And if I were you,

47:43.743 --> 47:48.497
I'd not make the mistake of bringing it
up again. - You're making the mistake.

47:48.956 --> 47:50.458
Yes? What mistake?

47:51.792 --> 47:53.169
Rambo.

48:52.937 --> 48:55.648
Damned Russian bastards.

49:20.256 --> 49:22.091
He's dead now.

49:32.226 --> 49:33.853
Bring him up!

49:53.247 --> 49:54.999
The knife!

49:55.499 --> 49:58.294
These people
are so vulgar in their methods!

49:59.128 --> 50:01.672
They lack compassion.

50:04.383 --> 50:07.803
I'm Lieutenant-Colonel Podovski.

50:09.430 --> 50:11.807
I do not know who you are yet,

50:12.308 --> 50:14.101
but I will.

50:14.560 --> 50:16.103
Take him and clean him up.

50:50.930 --> 50:52.390
That's all.

50:52.848 --> 50:56.686
Thank you, Captain Vinh.
Leave one guard, please.

51:01.399 --> 51:04.652
I see you are no stranger to pain.

51:05.111 --> 51:08.656
Perhaps you have been
among my Vietnamese comrades before?

51:11.659 --> 51:12.868
No answer?

51:14.036 --> 51:16.455
Do you wish to give your name?

51:16.956 --> 51:20.209
What possible harm can that cause?

51:23.254 --> 51:26.007
Pride is a poor substitute
for intelligence.

51:26.882 --> 51:30.261
What you must understand
is that we must interrogate you.

51:32.930 --> 51:36.934
For Sergeant Yushin you're a piece
of meat, a laboratory experiment.

51:37.393 --> 51:40.896
But for me you are a comrade,
similar to myself,

51:41.397 --> 51:44.734
just opposed by an act of fate.

51:46.318 --> 51:48.404
I know you were trying

51:48.863 --> 51:53.284
to facilitate the release
of war criminals. I can appreciate this.

51:54.368 --> 51:58.414
But this incident, your capture, is...

52:00.416 --> 52:01.625
...embarrassing.

52:02.293 --> 52:04.128
We must have an explanation.

52:04.587 --> 52:10.634
Radio your HQ and say that
you have been captured and condemned

52:11.135 --> 52:17.433
for espionage, and that attempts like
these should not be made in the future,

52:17.933 --> 52:22.563
or they
will meet with the same fate as you.

52:31.906 --> 52:33.407
Fuck you!

52:36.202 --> 52:39.538
You wish to test your strength... Good.

52:44.126 --> 52:45.711
Yushin!

53:45.730 --> 53:47.481
Comrade, here is something

53:47.982 --> 53:51.110
that might be of interest to you:

53:51.610 --> 53:55.364
A transcript of the conversation
between your helicopter pilot

53:55.865 --> 53:59.201
and his commander that we intercepted.

54:00.661 --> 54:04.999
"Dragonfly" and "Wolf's Den"...
Colorful names.

54:05.916 --> 54:07.001
Here we are:

54:07.460 --> 54:14.508
"We have them in sight". And the reply:
"Abort the operation immediately. "

54:15.926 --> 54:20.306
"This is a recall. Confirm. Over. "

54:21.474 --> 54:26.103
It seems you were abandoned
by direct command.

54:26.604 --> 54:29.857
And these are the people
you protect with your pain!

54:30.691 --> 54:32.943
Increase the voltage.

54:34.278 --> 54:38.282
You may scream. There is no shame.

55:09.105 --> 55:11.816
You are strong! Very strong!

55:12.274 --> 55:14.110
The strongest so far.

55:14.860 --> 55:18.280
But you're nearly dead. Poor waif.

55:18.864 --> 55:22.159
Make the radio call.

55:46.809 --> 55:49.854
To talk, to obey
would be so much easier.

56:04.785 --> 56:08.039
Yushin
has a memento for you of this day.

56:29.894 --> 56:32.521
Put it in his eye.

56:38.986 --> 56:43.282
If your own life
means nothing to you, perhaps his does.

56:43.783 --> 56:47.453
Don't tell them anything!
- You will talk.

56:57.463 --> 56:58.798
Yes?

57:34.333 --> 57:35.793
Don't do it!

57:38.045 --> 57:39.463
Do it

57:39.964 --> 57:41.382
now!

58:10.202 --> 58:13.247
Two-two-zero-five-six...

58:14.123 --> 58:16.375
Lone Wolf receive.

58:17.918 --> 58:20.421
This is Lone Wolf...

58:21.297 --> 58:25.468
Lone Wolf, this is Wolf's Den.
Transmit location and status.

58:25.968 --> 58:28.971
What is it?
- It's Rambo, Sir.

58:30.097 --> 58:33.142
We read you,
Lone Wolf. What is your position? Over.

58:34.769 --> 58:37.605
I say again:
What is your position? Over.

58:39.106 --> 58:42.902
Your friend dies if you do not answer.

58:44.779 --> 58:46.864
This is Trautman. Where are you?

58:51.702 --> 58:53.037
Come in!

59:02.088 --> 59:03.047
Murdock...

59:04.548 --> 59:06.092
He's here.

59:10.471 --> 59:12.890
Rambo, we're glad you're alive.

59:13.683 --> 59:18.020
Where are you? Give us your position,
and we'll come to pick you up.

59:26.904 --> 59:27.947
Murdock...

59:31.367 --> 59:33.285
I'm coming to get you!

01:01:55.636 --> 01:01:56.887
Duck!

01:03:02.203 --> 01:03:03.412
This way.

01:03:41.492 --> 01:03:43.703
We safe for now.

01:03:48.249 --> 01:03:52.586
You look like hell, Rambo.
- Tough night.

01:03:53.671 --> 01:03:55.798
Maybe need this.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.387
You hurt bad.
- It's alright.

01:04:08.519 --> 01:04:09.687
Listen...

01:04:10.604 --> 01:04:13.691
What you did back there...

01:04:14.191 --> 01:04:16.485
...I won't forget it.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.196
Thanks.

01:04:21.907 --> 01:04:23.242
What you do now?

01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:26.120
Try get across through Thailand?

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.331
Yeah.
- Then go America?

01:04:36.422 --> 01:04:38.507
You take me with you?

01:04:49.727 --> 01:04:51.228
You take me?

01:04:53.606 --> 01:04:54.565
Yeah.

01:04:57.735 --> 01:04:59.612
I think you make good choice.

01:05:02.615 --> 01:05:04.200
We go?
- Let's go.

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.322
You alright?

01:05:57.003 --> 01:05:59.755
You... not... forget... me.

01:06:00.214 --> 01:06:01.465
No.

01:06:20.192 --> 01:06:22.319
I want the rescue team
ready to go in one hour.

01:06:22.778 --> 01:06:28.784
You're risking everything. Do you think
one man's worth all that? - Yes.

01:06:29.243 --> 01:06:33.497
I order you to withdraw.
- I'll go over your head.

01:06:33.998 --> 01:06:38.336
You don't seem to understand that I'm
in charge here. You're just a tool.

01:06:39.712 --> 01:06:42.173
We're the machine.

01:06:42.673 --> 01:06:45.009
He's not to leave the base.

01:06:49.722 --> 01:06:54.435
He never had a chance, did he?
- Like you said: He went home.

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:10.249
Get back.

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:17.590
Come on! To the chopper!

01:21:18.049 --> 01:21:19.175
Move!

01:21:19.675 --> 01:21:21.761
To the chopper!

01:21:38.486 --> 01:21:39.987
Move!

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.146
You guys made it!

01:22:52.184 --> 01:22:54.145
Chopper on your tail!

01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:57.231
Hang on!

01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:27.405
Hold on!

01:24:34.745 --> 01:24:35.997
Fire in the tail!

01:26:40.329 --> 01:26:42.415
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

01:26:43.916 --> 01:26:47.169
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

01:26:47.878 --> 01:26:51.549
Wolf's Den,
this is Lone wolf, do you read?

01:26:54.301 --> 01:26:55.594
We hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.

01:26:56.053 --> 01:27:00.808
Prepare for emergency landing.
Arriving with American POWs.

01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:17.199
You heard. Prepare for landing of POWs!

01:28:34.026 --> 01:28:36.153
Glad you made it.

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.144
Rambo, I don't make the orders.

01:29:50.644 --> 01:29:52.772
I take them, just like you.

01:29:57.026 --> 01:30:00.905
I swear to God I didn't know
it was supposed to happen like this.

01:30:01.364 --> 01:30:04.200
It was just supposed
to be another assignment.

01:30:11.415 --> 01:30:12.458
Mission...

01:30:14.043 --> 01:30:15.753
...accomplished!

01:30:23.094 --> 01:30:25.429
You know there are more men out there.

01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.015
You know where they are.

01:30:30.309 --> 01:30:33.938
Find them, or I'll find you!

01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:00.715
Where are you going?

01:31:01.215 --> 01:31:02.883
I don't know.

01:31:04.552 --> 01:31:07.596
You'll get
a second Medal of Honor for this.

01:31:15.521 --> 01:31:20.109
They should give it to them.
They deserve it more.

01:31:21.444 --> 01:31:24.947
You can't keep running, John.
You're free now.

01:31:25.448 --> 01:31:27.575
Come back to us.

01:31:28.784 --> 01:31:30.536
Back to what?

01:31:31.662 --> 01:31:34.206
My friends died here,

01:31:35.291 --> 01:31:37.501
and part of me died here.

01:31:38.586 --> 01:31:44.133
The war may have been wrong,
but don't hate your country for it.

01:31:45.259 --> 01:31:46.218
Hate it?

01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:49.138
I'd die for it!

01:31:50.890 --> 01:31:52.933
What is it you want?

01:31:58.147 --> 01:31:59.982
I want

01:32:02.151 --> 01:32:04.153
what they want,

01:32:04.612 --> 01:32:07.823
and every other guy who came out here

01:32:08.324 --> 01:32:12.578
and spilt his guts
and gave everything he had:

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:16.957
For our country to love us

01:32:17.458 --> 01:32:19.543
as much as we love it.

01:32:22.254 --> 01:32:24.006
That's what I want.

01:32:30.638 --> 01:32:34.433
How will you live, John?
- Day by day.
