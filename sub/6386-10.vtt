- My name is Hank.
- I know.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.272
Oh!

00:06.306 --> 00:08.708
This is Mia, Bill's daughter.
And this is Hank.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.610
- She's 16.
- 16.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.980
Please do not make it like it
wasn't the least bit satisfying

00:14.014 --> 00:15.281
to fuck the wife of the man
who turned

00:15.315 --> 00:17.617
your precious book
into a big, shitty movie!

00:17.651 --> 00:20.419
Get on with your life
and forget about the woman

00:20.454 --> 00:22.054
you didn't want to marry.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.422
I'm gonna marry Bill.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.091
- Hank.
- Are you sure?

00:25.125 --> 00:26.926
Quick, before I change
my fucking mind.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.127
Karen, wait!

00:28.161 --> 00:30.062
- I made a huge mistake.
- No.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.831
The D.A.'s office was willing
to drop the assault charges.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.233
- That's the good news.
- What's the bad news?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.502
You're being charged
with statutory rape.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.671
The prosecution has a lame case,
and they know it too.

00:38.705 --> 00:39.939
I don't want you to be guilty.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.741
I don't want people
to look at you that way.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.276
And then Monday will come,

00:43.310 --> 00:44.844
and I'll take you to court

00:44.878 --> 00:49.348
so that you can stand trial
for raping a teenage girl.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.584

01:11.738 --> 01:13.539
- You look great.
- [Scoffs]

01:13.573 --> 01:16.442
I look like a fucking
FBI agent.

01:16.476 --> 01:19.412
A very brooding and comely
FBI agent.

01:19.446 --> 01:21.247
But still...

01:21.281 --> 01:23.282
Just keep putting one foot
in front of the other

01:23.317 --> 01:25.885
and it will be over
before you know it.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.354
That's exactly
what I'm afraid of.

01:28.388 --> 01:31.824
What are you afraid of,
exactly?

01:31.858 --> 01:33.693
Everything.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.861
Which is weird, you know,

01:35.896 --> 01:37.763
because I've spent my whole life
practicing zen

01:37.798 --> 01:39.265
and the art of
who gives a fuck?

01:39.299 --> 01:42.568
And now I just want
to get in the Porsche and drive.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.438
Well, it's just as well,
Becca totaled it.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.907
You know what I mean.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.976
I know what you mean.

01:50.010 --> 01:53.145
Can you tell me that
everything's gonna be all right?

01:53.180 --> 01:55.715
I can't tell you that.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.984
Can you tell me that you'll
be here when the smoke clears?

01:58.018 --> 02:02.088
I can't tell you that either.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.390
- What can you tell me?
- You're gonna be late.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.659
Mm. All right.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.259
- Come on.
- I... I just...

02:08.294 --> 02:11.297
I just need a few seconds.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.199
Gotta do... you know.

Yeah, thank you.
I'm not feeling

03:47.761 --> 03:49.528
particularly quippy
this morning.

I'm sorry, Karen...

04:08.014 --> 04:10.449

embarrassing you.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.218
For everything.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.421
You know what. You know how
you can make it up to me?

04:15.455 --> 04:19.024
Get in there, be a man,
deal with your shit,

04:19.059 --> 04:20.926
whatever happens.

04:20.961 --> 04:24.763
Or we could drive back
and head out to LAX,

pick a destination

Right.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.816
Look, how do I begin?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.585
How do I make you understand
how sorry I am?

05:19.619 --> 05:21.120
Save your breath, Hank.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.923
You want to know what it's like
to walk in my shoes?

05:23.957 --> 05:26.225
I want you to think
about Becca.

05:26.259 --> 05:29.228
What if I had sex with her?

05:29.262 --> 05:31.330
How would that make you feel?

05:31.364 --> 05:33.532
What would you do
to make it okay again?

05:33.567 --> 05:34.733
Would you hit me?

05:34.768 --> 05:37.269
Would you kill me?

05:37.304 --> 05:38.871
Or would you go in there,

05:38.905 --> 05:40.406
tell them exactly
what you know,

- There you are.
- Hey.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.618
I thought you made a run
for the border.

05:52.652 --> 05:54.286
I thought about it,
then I hit Taco Bell

05:54.321 --> 05:56.288
and the feeling passed.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.723

presiding.

All rise.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.005
Please be seated.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.977
The prosecution is
absolutely right...

06:52.012 --> 06:54.647
About one thing,
and one thing only.

06:54.681 --> 06:59.418
Mr. Moody had sexual intercourse
with a teenage girl.

06:59.452 --> 07:00.686
This is undisputed.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.857
On the night in question,
Mr. Moody was approached

07:04.891 --> 07:06.125
by a very attractive
young woman

07:06.159 --> 07:07.760
who made it very clear
she was interested

07:07.794 --> 07:09.094
in having sex with him.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.264
She went home with him
that night and did just that.

07:12.299 --> 07:15.100
At no point did Mr. Moody
inquire about her age,

07:15.135 --> 07:18.470
nor did Ms. Lewis
offer it to him.

07:18.505 --> 07:22.908
Is this a good thing?
A smart thing?

07:22.942 --> 07:24.143
An honorable thing?

07:24.177 --> 07:26.278
Absolutely not.

07:26.313 --> 07:31.216
But it is a reality
of the world we live in.

07:31.251 --> 07:34.286
Mr. Moody is far
from a boy scout.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.388
He would be the first
to confess his sins.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.825
But he did not knowingly
have sex with a minor.

07:39.859 --> 07:42.661
He had sex with
a very troubled young woman,

07:42.696 --> 07:45.931
who had reasons of her own
for obscuring the truth.

07:52.739 --> 07:56.508
I'd be lying if I didn't say
I was a little hard right now.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.310
You're good.

07:58.345 --> 08:01.146
Is the State ready to call
its first witness?

I'm fucking his wife.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.438

You don't want
to do that, Hank.

09:35.508 --> 09:38.644
Revenge is a dish
best served with my dick.

09:38.678 --> 09:42.414
He actually said,
"Revenge is a dish

09:42.449 --> 09:44.383

09:48.755 --> 09:50.122
Yeah, but he was
just kidding around.

09:50.156 --> 09:51.657
Oh, he was just kidding around.

09:51.691 --> 09:53.225
So he didn't really have
an affair with Mrs. Carr?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.260
Oh, well, yes, he did.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.829
- But that was all in good fun.
- I see.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.564
So your definition
of "good fun"

09:58.598 --> 10:00.599
is breaking up a marriage?

with Bill,

- I don't know.

- Don't be stupid, Hank.
- Too late.

I was afraid of.

Do you have my back
on this, Charlie?

12:11.197 --> 12:14.700
Just don't get us
arrested, okay?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.234
Word to your mother, Charlie.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.704
Word to your fucking mother,
you bald motherfucker.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.871
If only someone would
come along

12:19.906 --> 12:21.373
and steal you out
from under me.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.375
That ain't gonna happen.
That will never happen.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.543
I will never leave you.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.711
You know why?
I'll tell you.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.112
Because I love you,

12:27.146 --> 12:29.081
and I will totally become
your blood brother right now.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.816
Do you have a knife?
A shard of something?

12:30.850 --> 12:32.184
I'm good.
I'm go... I'm good. I'm good.

12:32.218 --> 12:35.454
Use these car keys.
Take the fucking wheel.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.325
[Groans]

12:45.131 --> 12:49.134
[Car alarm blaring]

12:58.044 --> 13:00.212
[Grunts]

13:00.246 --> 13:02.614
- Oh!
- [Laughing]

13:04.917 --> 13:06.585
Oh...

13:06.619 --> 13:08.286
What the fuck are you doing?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.422
You took a shit on my car!

13:10.456 --> 13:12.424
- Whoa, come on.
- Oh, fuck!

13:12.458 --> 13:15.260
[Car alarm continues blaring]

13:15.294 --> 13:18.063
- Don't...
- Come on!

13:18.097 --> 13:20.632
Here we go.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.934
[Laughs]

13:22.969 --> 13:25.804
Go, Charlie, go!

13:28.274 --> 13:30.075
Nothing further.

13:30.109 --> 13:31.576
[Scoffs]

13:31.611 --> 13:33.211
[Stifled chuckle]

13:36.015 --> 13:37.482
- Mr. Runkle...
- Yeah.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.451
Would you describe
Mr. Moody as more

13:39.485 --> 13:40.619
than just a client?

13:40.653 --> 13:41.887
Absolutely.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.789
I would describe him
as a friend.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.090
My best friend.

13:45.124 --> 13:48.160
And in what ways has he
acted as your friend?

13:48.194 --> 13:53.498
Well, there was a time
I was estranged from my wife...

13:53.533 --> 13:55.033
We're now divorced.

13:55.068 --> 13:58.270
She's having
another man's baby.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.805
They're living together now.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.206
- Mr. Runkle.
- Yes?

14:01.240 --> 14:02.808
We don't need quite
that much detail.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.478
Oh, I'm sorry.
Anyway, uh...

14:06.512 --> 14:07.846
Hank and I went out
drinking one night,

14:07.880 --> 14:10.382
and long story short,
we met this woman.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.818
She came back with us
to Hank's place,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.720
and I started putting
the moves on her.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.355
But she really wasn't
that interested.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.491
Fact is, she wanted
to sleep with Hank.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.826
But Hank really wasn't
that interested.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.893
He wanted to go to bed.

14:21.928 --> 14:23.395
You know, get some sleep.

14:23.429 --> 14:26.531
- But you know what he did?
- Mr. Runkle, it's okay,

14:26.566 --> 14:28.066
- let me rephrase the question.
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.501
No, you want to know
what he did?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.570
He agreed to have
a threesome with us anyway.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.573
That's right, because that is
the kind of friend he is.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.575
And it turned into
a total botch too

14:36.609 --> 14:38.910
because the woman in question
was a squirter.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.413
- Pshhh... a squirter!
- Mr. Runkle!

14:41.447 --> 14:43.849
I'm sorry.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.552
A female ejaculator.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.828
Nothing further, your honor.

14:56.863 --> 15:00.599
Mr. Runkle,
you're excused.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.067
If it please the court,
the state calls

15:02.101 --> 15:03.735
Karen Van Der Beek.

15:06.139 --> 15:11.343
In your opinion, how much
did Hank Moody hate Bill Lewis?

15:11.377 --> 15:13.245
Well, hate is
a very strong word.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.114
I hate you, Bill.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.449
That's lovely, Hank.
Thank you.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.917
[Loudly]
Karen? Karen!

15:18.951 --> 15:21.386
- Hey...
- Karen!

15:21.420 --> 15:22.921
Can I have my family back now?

15:22.955 --> 15:25.023
Please?
Pretty please?

15:25.057 --> 15:26.424
Go away, Hank.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.694
I feel I must warn you, Bill,
I have a gun.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.596
And I will use it.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.065
I will shoot you
right between the eyes.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.969
And if that doesn't work,
I will kick you in the cunt.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.038
That's a water gun, Hank.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.040
Filled with hot sauce,
motherfucker. Banzai!

15:42.074 --> 15:45.610
Hank, what the fuck!
Will you grow up!

15:45.645 --> 15:47.312
Give that... Stop.

15:47.346 --> 15:48.980
What are you doing?
Karen...

15:49.015 --> 15:51.449
Hi, Karen.
You're so pretty.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.486
- Are you okay?
- Shall I linger?

15:54.520 --> 15:57.055
- No, no, I got it.
- This is getting old, Hank.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.690
No older than you are, Bill.

15:58.724 --> 15:59.758
Booyah!

15:59.792 --> 16:02.427
- Shut up.
- Nailed it!

16:02.461 --> 16:04.963
- I'm sorry...Hank, go.
- Okay, are you ready?

16:04.997 --> 16:07.065
Are you ready to come home now?

16:07.099 --> 16:08.200
- What?
- Are you ready to call an end

16:08.234 --> 16:09.267
to this little flight of fancy?

16:09.302 --> 16:10.902
Because guess what...
I forgive you.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.838
- Hank...Shut up.
- You're welcome.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.941
It's over, okay?
The fat lady has sung.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.310
She has left the building.
You've gotta get used to this.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.512
- Let me see Becca.
- No, you're drunk.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.113
She's seen me drunk before.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.648
And I'm a happy drunk,
anyway. Yeee...

16:23.683 --> 16:25.817
- Go home.
- Don't use that word.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.619
You're not allowed
to use that word.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.321
It's not fair.
I don't have a home.

16:29.355 --> 16:30.322
Okay, I'm not using it, okay?

16:30.356 --> 16:31.923
- Go home.
- Give me my gun.

16:31.958 --> 16:32.991
Give me my gun.
Can I have my gun back?

16:33.025 --> 16:34.125
Yes.
[Gun squirts]

16:34.160 --> 16:36.428
Ow! Oh!

16:36.462 --> 16:38.697
Your cross,
Ms. Rhoads.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.001
Let me get this straight.

16:43.035 --> 16:44.836
You broke up with Mr. Moody,

16:44.871 --> 16:47.005
moved in with Mr. Lewis,
agreed to marry him,

16:47.039 --> 16:48.506
but left him
on your wedding night

16:48.541 --> 16:50.108
to move back in
with Mr. Moody.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.978
You then kicked Mr. Moody out
because you thought

16:53.012 --> 16:54.679
he impregnated a friend,

16:54.714 --> 16:56.047
moved to New York
for a job opportunity,

16:56.082 --> 16:58.416
left your daughter
in Mr. Moody's care,

16:58.451 --> 17:00.185
came back,
played house some more.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.153
And then you broke it off
yet again

17:02.188 --> 17:04.055
when Mr. Moody was accused
of statutory rape.

17:04.089 --> 17:07.025
Is that correct?

17:07.059 --> 17:09.928
Wow.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.897
You make me sound crazy when
you say it out loud like that.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.598
Your words, not mine.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.001
Is that the sequence of events?

17:18.304 --> 17:19.771
Yes.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.541
Nothing further.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.187
I like this whole recess idea.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.356
Takes me back
to my formative years.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.557
How long do we get?

17:39.592 --> 17:41.326
Do we have time
for a game of kickball?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.962
Maybe she'll give him
another chance.

17:45.531 --> 17:46.998
Ah, shit.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.334
You didn't have to be so hard
on her up there, you know.

17:49.368 --> 17:52.003
Do you want to go to jail?

17:52.038 --> 17:53.471
Is this another one
of your trick questions?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.273
Just let me do my job.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.076
You just sit there
and look pretty.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.978
I can do that.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.715
I think.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.485
How deep do these feelings
run, by the way?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.454
Huh?

18:09.488 --> 18:11.756
I just want to know
what I'm dealing with here.

18:11.791 --> 18:15.427
I can't believe I'm having
a relationship conversation

18:15.461 --> 18:19.064
with my lawyer on the first day
of my trial.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.566
I can't believe I'm having
a relationship conversation.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.134
I know.
You're such a girl, right?

18:23.169 --> 18:25.937
Shut up. I am serious...
I will cut your dick off.

18:25.972 --> 18:28.473
And...I'm hard.

18:28.507 --> 18:29.808
Again.

18:29.842 --> 18:33.712
<i>Et tu,</i> Runkle-us?

18:33.746 --> 18:35.213
Okay, you...

18:35.247 --> 18:37.248
After all the stories
we rehearsed,

18:37.283 --> 18:38.917
I missed the part
where I said, "Fuck it,

18:38.951 --> 18:40.318
let's go with
female ejaculation!"

18:40.353 --> 18:42.320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.289
He kept... he was twisting
my words around.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.224
Did you see that?

18:46.258 --> 18:47.792
I got really fucking nervous.

18:47.827 --> 18:51.262
Oh, it's okay, buddy boy.
It's all right.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.099
And for what it's worth,
it was really fun

18:54.133 --> 18:55.834
hearing that poop story again.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.937
I know. Right?
[Laughs]

19:00.473 --> 19:05.310
If it please the court,
the State calls William Lewis.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.554
Here comes sweet Dick Willie.

19:16.589 --> 19:20.492
Do you find him attractive,
sexually?

19:29.835 --> 19:36.641
[Hank muttering indistinctly]

19:36.675 --> 19:38.043
Mia!

19:38.077 --> 19:40.211
Daddy?
Welcome home.

19:40.246 --> 19:43.782
Get inside, now!

19:43.816 --> 19:45.984
What the fuck are you doing
in my house?

19:46.018 --> 19:48.219
I came to get my family...

19:48.254 --> 19:50.021
But I passed out.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.457
- You're pathetic.
- Ne...

19:52.491 --> 19:55.593
Oh, good God, man,

19:55.628 --> 19:57.996
get yourself together!

19:58.030 --> 20:02.100
Get me a strainer.
I'll clean it up.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.468
I'll make it nice.

20:03.502 --> 20:06.071
Just get the fuck out of here.

20:06.105 --> 20:07.772
I can do that.

20:07.807 --> 20:12.110
Just do me a solid, Bill.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.711
Don't tell 'em I was here.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.014
That would be my pleasure.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.551
I'm sorry I'm such a turd
in the punch bowl.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.886
I just really miss them.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.522
Yeah, I'm sure you do.
They're pretty fantastic.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.425
And as much as you blame me,
this is your doing.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.793
I know that.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.062
Why do you think
I'm so fucked up?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.134
Can you give me a hand?

20:36.168 --> 20:38.236
Yeah.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.139
You're a nice man, Bill.

20:41.173 --> 20:44.642
[Gags]
Oh, Jesus!

20:44.677 --> 20:46.945
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.180
- All right.
- You're handsome too.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.849
A real tall drink of water.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.685
I see what Karen sees
in you now... I get it.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.086
I bet you've got
a nice dong too.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.121
You must.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.255
- Ooh!
- Karen has a thing

20:57.289 --> 20:58.356
for pretty dongs.

20:58.390 --> 21:01.459
- Let's go.
- Good for you, Bill.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.361
So let me see if I understand.

21:03.395 --> 21:04.963
When you arrived home
from your business trip.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.064
You found Hank and Mia
having some sort of

21:06.098 --> 21:08.099
poolside conversation.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.368
That's correct.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.970
And when was that, exactly?

21:12.004 --> 21:14.806
July 12, 2007.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.375
Which would mean
you arrived home

21:17.409 --> 21:19.911
and saw Hank Moody
having a conversation

21:19.945 --> 21:23.281
with your daughter prior
to the night of August 13th?

21:23.315 --> 21:24.382
Yes.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.618
[Courtroom murmuring]

21:26.652 --> 21:30.255
[Bangs gavel]
Quiet down, please. Quiet.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.924
Mr. Lewis,
do you believe

21:32.958 --> 21:36.327
that Hank Moody set out
to sleep with your daughter

21:36.362 --> 21:37.629
as a way of getting back
at you?

21:37.663 --> 21:40.265
I most certainly do. Yes.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.799
[Scattered murmurs]

21:41.834 --> 21:42.834

Quiet.

What condition
was the defendant in

21:51.644 --> 21:53.511
when you found him talking
to your daughter?

21:53.546 --> 21:54.846
He was drunk.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.981
How drunk?

are you?

My family lives here.
I've come to rescue them.

22:34.220 --> 22:37.522
Hmm. How's that
working out for you?

22:37.556 --> 22:39.324
Not as well as I'd planned.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.159
Hmm. If they were really
your family,

22:41.193 --> 22:43.294
don't you think they'd
be with you right now?

22:43.329 --> 22:45.863
It's complicated.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.500
You really love them,
don't you?

22:49.535 --> 22:53.571
Yeah. So much so
that the words themselves

22:53.606 --> 22:55.373
sound unspeakably lame.

22:55.407 --> 22:59.377
God, that's hot.

22:59.411 --> 23:00.712
Mia!

23:00.746 --> 23:02.780
Daddy? Welcome home.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.483
Get inside, now!

23:05.517 --> 23:09.420
Why didn't you think
to mention this before?

23:09.455 --> 23:12.657
Because I... I didn't think
it mattered.

23:12.691 --> 23:14.726
I mean, he was so drunk.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.928
He was in and out of sleep.

23:16.962 --> 23:18.630
The night that we met
at the bookstore,

23:18.664 --> 23:21.499
he had no idea who I was.
None.

23:24.136 --> 23:27.672
What was your relationship
with Karen like?

23:27.706 --> 23:31.542
It was fine.
She was nice.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.645
I didn't ask if she was nice.

23:33.679 --> 23:35.680
I asked what
your relationship was like

23:35.714 --> 23:38.683
when you were forced to live
together under the same roof.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.890
Hey, Mia, where are you going

23:45.924 --> 23:48.092
- dressed like that?
- Uh, out.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.927
Out where?

23:49.962 --> 23:51.596
Just out. Who cares?

23:51.630 --> 23:54.165
I care. Who with?

23:54.199 --> 23:56.200
Some guy.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.670
Some guy?
What, some guy from school?

23:58.704 --> 24:01.339
- No, he's older.
- He's older?

24:01.373 --> 24:03.041
Okay, how much older?

24:03.075 --> 24:04.842
Significantly.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.044
Mia, come on.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.079
Your dad's out of town.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.714
He is not gonna want you
tramping around

24:09.748 --> 24:10.848
with some older guy.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.183
My dad's always out of town.

24:12.217 --> 24:14.118
I don't think he cares
about my whereabouts.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.521
Mia, come on.

24:16.555 --> 24:19.223
Hey, Becca and I, we're
gonna watch a movie.

24:19.258 --> 24:21.259
Um, <i>Manhattan.</i>
I just...

24:21.293 --> 24:23.127
You want to join us?

24:23.162 --> 24:25.730
I don't want to see a movie.
I want to go out.

24:25.764 --> 24:27.332
But you know, maybe...
maybe you shouldn't.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.067
Maybe there's trouble
out there.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.268
You know what I mean?

24:30.302 --> 24:31.369
Well, what's so wrong
with that?

24:31.403 --> 24:32.670
Don't you ever want to
just go out

24:32.705 --> 24:34.772
- and get into trouble?
- Sure, when I was your age.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.607
But you know what,
I wish once in a while

24:36.642 --> 24:37.842
someone had asked me to stay in

24:37.876 --> 24:39.544
and watch a movie instead.

24:39.578 --> 24:42.580
Come on, you know you want to.

24:42.614 --> 24:44.816
- Nah, I'm gonna go.
- Mia,

24:44.850 --> 24:46.651
you know what, at this point
I'm not really asking you,

24:46.685 --> 24:48.786
- I'm telling you.
- Oh, you're <i>telling</i> me.

24:48.821 --> 24:49.821
- Yeah.
- [Chuckles] Oh.

24:49.855 --> 24:51.322
What are you gonna do about it?

24:51.357 --> 24:53.558
- Don't test me.
- [Laughs]

24:53.592 --> 24:54.892
Fuck you.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.865
She was just being sweet.

25:00.899 --> 25:04.335
But that just made me
more mad, you know.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.204
My mother was dead,

25:06.238 --> 25:09.374
and my father decided
to bury his grief

25:09.408 --> 25:12.377
in a new girlfriend.

25:12.411 --> 25:15.246
I just wanted to go out
and get into trouble.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.716
At the same time,
I wanted her to stop me.

25:18.751 --> 25:21.386
It felt good, someone caring
enough to say no,

25:21.420 --> 25:25.289
but I just told her, "fuck off,"
and I stormed out.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.491
That guy was a jerk.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.459
I left him at some bar
on Abbot Kinney,

25:28.494 --> 25:30.795
and I started
walking home thinking

25:30.829 --> 25:34.799
I'd catch whatever was left
of <i>Manhattan.</i>

25:34.833 --> 25:39.704
But then I wandered
into the bookstore,

25:39.738 --> 25:43.808
and I found the trouble
that I was looking for.

25:45.744 --> 25:48.980
Nothing further.

25:54.186 --> 25:58.122
♪ I am wanted dead or alive ♪

25:58.157 --> 25:59.824
That was horrible.

25:59.858 --> 26:02.927
It was like watching
<i>This Is Your Life</i> in 3D,

26:02.961 --> 26:06.230
on acid, with my creepy uncle's
dick on my shoulder.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.065
- What the fuck, Hank?
- What the fuck what?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.568
That jury is now
under the assumption

26:10.602 --> 26:12.603
that you knew Mia before
you actually slept together.

26:12.638 --> 26:13.704
Yes, but...

26:13.739 --> 26:14.939
The seed of doubt
has been planted.

26:14.973 --> 26:18.409
That's all it takes.
Do you...

26:18.444 --> 26:20.912
This changes everything.

26:28.987 --> 26:30.888
Whew, some day, huh?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.423
So you knew who she was
all along?

26:32.458 --> 26:34.358
No, not you too, Karen.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.160
No, I have no memory
of that. None.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.696
Amnesia. Convenient.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.498
You don't understand, those
days were all a blur to me.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.266
I <i>do</i> understand. Yeah.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.636
You can't remember.
I will never forget!

26:45.671 --> 26:47.305
It's that asshole's job

26:47.339 --> 26:48.940
to make me look
like an asshole.

26:48.974 --> 26:51.542
Yeah, well, you know what,
he didn't have to work too hard.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.711
The only thing I'm guilty of
is poor judgment.

26:53.745 --> 26:56.481
Yeah, me too.
