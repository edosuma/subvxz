Ah! walk away.

02:37.446 --> 02:39.566
Alright come on guys.

02:39.696 --> 02:44.981
So how long have they been dating, I know you
have to multiply, it by seven or something but.

02:45.112 --> 02:49.521
I'm just trying to get an idea how long to go
out with somebody before tying the knot you know

02:49.564 --> 02:51.858
Okay.

02:51.987 --> 02:54.025
Give me that.

02:56.279 --> 02:59.692
Come on guys work with me.
Sit up, sit up, sit up.

03:00.487 --> 03:05.561
Tonya, Tonya!

03:07.571 --> 03:11.693
What are you doing? I'm so Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

03:11.728 --> 03:11.728
Will you stop dancing.

03:27.404 --> 03:30.438
I so very much like espresso.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.776
It's strong and enjoyably better.

03:36.863 --> 03:41.603
I see you, Agent Ross you prefer
a straight forward cup of coffee...

03:41.738 --> 03:47.153
While you Agent Meyers you pick
a latte and add much sweetness.

03:47.279 --> 03:50.526
This is why, I became a
US citizen.

03:50.655 --> 03:54.399
America is the land of many choices.

03:54.530 --> 03:57.362
Plus Croatian coffee tastes like
dog urine..

03:57.488 --> 04:01.233
Why exactly did you want to
meet with us, Mr. Nikitin?

04:01.363 --> 04:03.304
You and your wife have already
obtained citizenship.

04:03.465 --> 04:05.782
I don't think there's anything we can
anything we can help you with,

04:06.030 --> 04:10.568
I want my daughter Masha to have
the same opportunity, without the wait.

04:10.696 --> 04:12.314
So what are you suggesting Sir?

04:12.315 --> 04:16.233
I am more than willing to pay a reasonable fee
to expedite her paperwork,

04:16.235 --> 04:23.113
My understanding that the traditional
cost of this service is $10,000 US Dollars.

04:26.113 --> 04:31.351
Well whatever your understanding of
by-passing US immigration laws is Mr Nikitin...

04:31.488 --> 04:35.612
Were not in the business of
expediting anybodys citizentship.

04:35.738 --> 04:38.319
Your lucky we don't arrest you.
for trying to bribe us.

04:38.320 --> 04:44.193
We'll be paying close attention to your Daughter.

04:45.193 --> 04:52.321
You said that they could be bought? That's what
I was told, dont worry well find someone else.

04:52.322 --> 04:57.350
No INS will be watching her closely,
we must find another way.

05:08.447 --> 05:14.314
Okay, alright, ooh. hey the sooner we get this done,
the sooner you can go back to pillaging.

05:14.447 --> 05:18.441
He's just messing with you. your a big old baby,
Give me a wet one Brutus.

05:20.739 --> 05:23.902
You need to get to know him that's all... Rub him between
his hinds, and you can pose him any way you like...

05:24.030 --> 05:28.154
Sorry did you say rub him Between his hinds? you
want him to co-operate. You gotta give him a tickle.

05:28.280 --> 05:32.356
I'm not a tickler type..
I think You should probably tickle your own dog.

05:32.489 --> 05:36.317
Your AD says satisfaction guaranteed.
or I dont pay holmes.

05:39.405 --> 05:41.396
Okay.

05:41.530 --> 05:45.192
I can tickle a dog. Usually I would take
you out to dinner first, but this is um.

05:46.322 --> 05:48.858
There you go.

05:50.697 --> 05:52.688
A Huh, I'm sorry I'm late.

05:54.156 --> 05:59.690
Are you rubbing that dogs happy spot? It's the only
way he'll co-operate. well I could have told you that!

05:59.822 --> 06:04.775
Oh um you know what um, that's my next client. would you just
show her the costumes, and dont bring her out until I say Okay.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.987
Got It.
Oh Lord!

06:09.864 --> 06:11.522
Yehllo.

06:11.656 --> 06:17.155
I am here for photograph of cat.!

06:17.281 --> 06:21.061
I love your accent.
It's Venezuelan right?

06:23.072 --> 06:26.652
Okay! I think about massaging him again.
No, no no we got it.

06:26.781 --> 06:30.691
He was snarling the whole time. and that's what
pirates do. I'll email you the proofs you'I love em.

06:30.822 --> 06:35.563
So we cant decide between the Ballerina or an angel?
I told yah, I told you not to bring the cat!

06:37.364 --> 06:39.189
Meoow!

06:42.573 --> 06:44.149

06:44.281 --> 06:47.196
Come back, Brutus.

06:57.614 --> 07:01.987

07:22.656 --> 07:27.065

07:27.198 --> 07:32.318
I'm really sorry about what happened,
It's okay, accidents happen.

07:37.781 --> 07:43.979
Why haven't you asked me out?
I've been your assistant for a whole month now.

07:46.031 --> 07:49.314
Em Yeah, and you've been um...

07:49.448 --> 07:53.821
really creative with the squeaky toys.
that's like uh a talent that.

07:53.948 --> 07:56.615
Dont you find me attractive?

07:57.698 --> 08:02.071
Yeah, but you know it's not a good idea...
I feel,

08:03.157 --> 08:06.937
A really strong connection between us.

08:08.032 --> 08:13.945
If I moved in with you, I'd
never be late to work. Yeah, yeah

08:14.073 --> 08:18.149
But!, an alarm clock
would probably work also you know.

08:22.615 --> 08:25.447
Think about it okay.

08:27.698 --> 08:28.978
Okay...

08:40.532 --> 08:42.274
Show me tongue.

08:43.907 --> 08:46.940
You suffer from stress.
Yeah tell me about it.

08:47.074 --> 08:50.818
Chi out of balance.
We fix.

08:51.907 --> 08:55.438
Um I've never done this before.
Does this hurt?

08:55.574 --> 09:00.196
No pain. Close eyes. Relax.

09:07.449 --> 09:10.779
Okay, this is'nt that bad.

09:19.532 --> 09:22.862
You look a bit stressed, what the!
Do you want me to help you out with that?

09:29.699 --> 09:32.697
You like borscht?
It's old Family Recipe.

09:37.241 --> 09:41.400
My name is Vlatko Nikitin.
Brickland and Oleg they work for me.

09:41.532 --> 09:43.404
You can call me Brick.

09:43.532 --> 09:46.863
What do you want? I mean
This is kidnapping.

09:46.991 --> 09:51.299
No, no kidnapping you came here voluntarily.
to make amends, Amends.

09:51.350 --> 09:56.486
Amends for what? I did'nt do anything.
Tell that to my wife's cat.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.649
Oh I'm so sorry about that.
I have a new assistant...

09:59.782 --> 10:06.941
Cat is worthless. I bought it in Dubrovnik
for 3 kuneh. that's uh, 54 US cents.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.613
Look I'll pay you for all your vet charges.
cat is simply cat to me.

10:11.741 --> 10:17.026
I prefer goat. But my wife
Borislava she is heartsick.

10:17.158 --> 10:22.988
Look ah, Mr. Nik... Nicotine, um,
What can I do to make this right Sir?

10:23.116 --> 10:29.480
Easiest solution would have Brickland and Oleg put
you in cement shoes and take you for swim in lake.

10:37.033 --> 10:41.820
What's the next easiest solution?
Marry my daughter, Masha.

10:44.575 --> 10:49.149
Excuse me? Masha having problems with Visa.
Marriage solves problem.

10:49.283 --> 10:52.400
What your saying, you want me to marry
your daughter so she can get her green card?

10:52.533 --> 10:57.320
After one year you get annulment,
and you have no further debt to my family.

10:57.450 --> 11:02.687
No I've never even met her.
relax please marriage is purely for show.

11:02.825 --> 11:07.316
Masha will be marrying Brickland in one years time.
Brickland is like a son to me...

11:07.450 --> 11:10.448
But he is very jealous.

11:10.575 --> 11:14.590
So I would not consider
any sexual activity...

11:14.615 --> 11:18.687
With hand or mouth or he will kill you,
in a very unpleasant way. Okay

11:18.825 --> 11:24.692
I'm sorry, but this conversation is over. I'm really apologetic
about your cat, and that whole situation but I'm outta here...

11:25.617 --> 11:28.105
Brian. You do not know who I am.

11:28.242 --> 11:31.856
Many powerfull men
have tried to cross me,

11:31.992 --> 11:34.943
Where are they now?
Who knows?

11:35.075 --> 11:38.108
You, you are not a powerfull man.

11:38.500 --> 11:43.572
But you are an intelligent man.
I believe you will make the right decision.

11:43.700 --> 11:48.404
Goodmo! shall we live forever.
Goodmo! Goodmo

12:27.700 --> 12:29.525
Who the hell is this? It's me mom,

12:29.659 --> 12:32.959
You'd better be in the
emergency room or jail to be calling me at this hour

12:32.992 --> 12:37.614
I'm in the middle of a facial detox!
for Gods sake.

12:37.742 --> 12:41.072
Mom! I have to marry a Croatian girl,
or her fathers going to have me killed.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.531
So marry her.
Did you hear what I just said?

12:44.659 --> 12:51.485
Yes this is good news. No this not good news Mom,
did you miss the part about him murdering me.

12:51.617 --> 12:55.397
Do you love her?
No I dont, Ma I've never even met her.

12:55.534 --> 12:59.859
Look the whole thing is complicated.
Oh it's always too complicated with you.

12:59.992 --> 13:04.945
Is she old enough to bear children?
What? I hear Eastern European women are very fertile.

13:05.076 --> 13:09.069
Mom you know this is not helping.
What does she look like?

13:09.201 --> 13:12.566
<i>I do not know, but judging by her mother,
she's not gonna win any beauty contests</i>

13:12.701 --> 13:17.109
We all get ugly, it's only a matter of time
Does she have any money?

13:17.242 --> 13:21.283
I dont, her father is some kind of crime boss.
so she comes from money.

13:21.409 --> 13:25.865
Are'nt you even listening? Do you have
other women in your life? oh here we go.

13:25.993 --> 13:29.193
I'm not getting any younger Brian,
I need some grandchildren already!

13:29.326 --> 13:34.659
Well that's not gonna happen, they said I can't even touch her.
My father told your dad the same thing, you think he listened.

13:34.784 --> 13:37.782
You were conceived in an elevator,
on our honeymoon. Oh!

13:37.909 --> 13:41.903
I had the close door button imprinted
on my forehead for two days.

13:42.034 --> 13:48.114
Mom, I did not need to hear that. All men are afraid
of commitment. stop whining and marry this girl.

13:48.243 --> 13:50.233
That's all I'm gonna say.

13:52.368 --> 13:56.029
Do you like plane?
I pay half price.

13:56.159 --> 14:00.319
Sounds like you got a screaming deal.
Yes, screamng was involved.

14:01.784 --> 14:06.323
Wedding is in two week.
Brickland wishes to be your best man.

14:07.743 --> 14:10.066
I'm Moved.

14:10.201 --> 14:14.740
Give this Masha. during vows it will help
convince Authorities, you are serious.

14:14.868 --> 14:18.731
Do you wish to invite witnesses?
ah no!, I'm an only child.

14:20.165 --> 14:22.882
My dads gone, my mom is.
lets Just say,

14:22.917 --> 14:25.600
My mom has a prior commitment... Okay,

14:26.100 --> 14:29.616
Meeting over. Get-out.

14:41.701 --> 14:45.233
What do you mean you're
getting married?

14:45.368 --> 14:47.939
I mean I'm getting married.

14:48.076 --> 14:53.658
How long have you been sleeping with her? that's
a little inappropriate. How long? Tonya, How long?

14:55.077 --> 14:58.110
I haven't slept with her yet okay.

14:58.243 --> 15:01.360
Huh, what is she a virgin or something?

15:01.493 --> 15:06.281
- What does she look like, she sexy?
- uh! She's Croatian.

15:06.410 --> 15:09.776
Does she even speak English?
I hope so.

15:09.910 --> 15:13.192
Did you order her off Ebay or something?
I did not order her off Ebay.

15:13.327 --> 15:18.316
Then how come you've never mentioned her?
because I'ts complicated Okay.

15:25.202 --> 15:28.484
You know Brian I'm not stupid.

15:28.618 --> 15:32.826
If you wanted to dump me, you didn't have
to invent some christation Virgin,

15:32.952 --> 15:36.780
Croatian, Croation.
And I did not invent her. Okay

15:36.910 --> 15:40.323
<i>I've never been dumped.
I do the dumping you understand!</i>

15:40.452 --> 15:43.023
How can I dump you if we've never gone out.

15:43.160 --> 15:47.201
You know what If it makes you feel better
go ahead and dump me. Why would I do that?

15:48.660 --> 15:52.441
- I love you. Okay! Um,
- Look Tonya.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.658
I think you may have
misunderstood our relationship okay.

15:55.785 --> 16:02.398
Look Brian, I don't know about a lot of things, but one
thing I do know about is about men. and you definitely...

16:02.535 --> 16:07.442
You kow what, I'm sorry I'm getting married.

16:08.827 --> 16:11.067
We'll see about that.

16:12.869 --> 16:15.820
Ah, What is that supposed to mean?

16:15.952 --> 16:18.820
Okay, Let's go over it one more time.

16:18.952 --> 16:22.199
Ok, we met two months ago at the Ballet.
Which Ballet?

16:22.327 --> 16:26.368
The ah! " The Gazelle".
"Giselle" at the Joffrey! Yes, Yes

16:26.494 --> 16:28.899
Look, does it have to be the ballet?

16:29.994 --> 16:32.613
Masha loves to dancing!
it's her passion.

16:32.744 --> 16:36.441
She's a very a very passionate person, ok whatever,
So we went to the ballet, then we started dating...

16:36.577 --> 16:40.618
Where did you propose to her?
At the Ukrainian bistro.

16:40.744 --> 16:44.192
Ukrainian village restaurant.
What's her favorite drink?

16:44.327 --> 16:47.444
I know this one. Stav, stav, stav...

16:47.577 --> 16:49.983
<i>Stavlenniy myod.
It's a strong liquor.</i>

16:50.119 --> 16:53.567
- What's her favorite colour?
- that's Blue.

16:53.703 --> 16:56.654
Red! It's red final answer.

16:56.786 --> 16:59.570
What does she hate more than anything? Um!

16:59.703 --> 17:02.108
Big Limey thugs.

17:02.244 --> 17:08.075
Womanizers! womanizers she hates womanizers.
Brick I was kidding, it was a bad joke in retrospect.

17:08.203 --> 17:12.825
You listen to me. The dates been set for you
and Masha to meet at a nightclub.

17:12.953 --> 17:19.316
You put on a good show for your Authorities,
but if you go too far! I'll rip your heart out.

17:19.453 --> 17:22.949
Okay. I appreciate your encouragement, sir.

17:25.786 --> 17:29.650
You know this would help,
if I knew what she looked like.

17:31.911 --> 17:35.822
To me she's the most
beautifull woman in the world.

17:50.703 --> 17:55.444
Hi, I'm Brian.
Brick told me a lot about you.

17:56.245 --> 18:01.068
Zoya.
Zoya? your not Masha?

18:01.203 --> 18:04.236
- Zoya.
- your not Masha that's Awesome!

18:10.120 --> 18:16.490
Masha!
Hi...

18:20.870 --> 18:23.026
Brian?

18:24.953 --> 18:27.157
Masha?

18:29.078 --> 18:33.487
Anya? Take us to the table,
Okay.

18:34.453 --> 18:36.243
Come on.

18:46.745 --> 18:48.652
Thank you.

18:52.453 --> 18:55.985
This is awkward.
Yes it is.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.651
I had no idea what you look like.

18:59.787 --> 19:04.279
You look disappointed. No, no, not
disappointed, your English is perfect.

19:04.412 --> 19:06.900
Oh I had an American Nanny
my whole childhood.

19:07.037 --> 19:10.485
You look exactly the way
I thought you would. I do?

19:10.620 --> 19:14.199
I checked out your Facebook profile.

19:14.329 --> 19:20.657
Oh my. um listen that was one night a bachelor party,
I was wearing my cowboy boots, my friends, not together

19:21.787 --> 19:25.484
I know your only here because of what happened
to my mother cats. I'm so sorry about that.

19:25.620 --> 19:30.858
No, no, no, No offense, or anything, but I dont
wanna marry you either. I dont even know you.

19:30.995 --> 19:34.824
I know that your a photographer
and that you have hazel brown eyes...

19:34.954 --> 19:37.822
But that hardly qualifies.

19:39.829 --> 19:43.988
Look I know I'm breaking the law I could have
been admitted legally in less than a year...

19:44.121 --> 19:47.901
but that was before my father
decided to bribe the INS.

19:48.037 --> 19:51.699
I told him to stay out of it, but...

19:54.371 --> 19:59.656
Okay, there are two men, and their
watching us right now.

I think You know Mr Lighthouse, yes. Masha's Nikitin's visa about
to run out, and she conveniently marries you in the nick of time.

22:38.164 --> 22:41.660
Did her father offer you

very powerfull Eastern European crime figure.

22:47.705 --> 22:52.612

Murder, and you wanna be his son in-law?

22:52.747 --> 22:58.495
How much is he paying you Lighthouse?
Nothing, and I will swear that on a stack of Bibles.

22:58.622 --> 23:04.240

Or you'll end up dead. You really think
he's gonna let you walk away from this.

23:26.414 --> 23:33.288
If this wedding is the result of coercion,
we can offer you full immunity if you help us.

23:35.206 --> 23:38.571
Help you do what? Well we need to know
everything about Nikitins business dealings.

23:38.706 --> 23:41.076
Bank accounts, money laundering, the works.

23:44.956 --> 23:50.193

You and I have shared
many intimate moments together.

Most of them have involved animals.

27:24.666 --> 27:28.956
Some like the night where you made me dress up
like a kitten...

28:23.041 --> 28:28.244
It's not like I have a choice.
My wife she's excellent judge of character.

28:28.375 --> 28:33.079
She sees what she sees,
even if you blind.

28:33.833 --> 28:37.495
I dont love your daughter,
Nothing must happen on Honeymoon

28:37.625 --> 28:42.163
But then why are we even going on honeymoon?
INS will suspect nothing.

28:42.292 --> 28:45.740
Result is far.
Maybe they not follow.

28:45.875 --> 28:52.038
Eye's will be watching you. So make sure that
the little-Brian does not take over for big Brian.

28:52.167 --> 28:54.951

28:57.708 --> 29:01.572
Dont worry,

29:24.959 --> 29:28.999
"What did she say?
'she said take good care of our Masha"

29:29.125 --> 29:32.538
" Or you will suffer more
beyond all imagination. "

29:33.500 --> 29:37.446
Oh that's what I thought she said.

29:49.042 --> 29:53.118
You know you did'nt say a word to me during
the whole flight. You passed out the entire flight.

29:53.251 --> 29:58.322
Can we talk about this? What is there to talk
about? You play your part and I'll play mine.

29:58.459 --> 30:03.282
Yeah! were gonna be spending a lot of time together.

Yeah Hi! were um on the 11am flight to Nuku Hiva,
Staying at the Lover's Bay Resort,.

30:22.959 --> 30:27.865
Oh I'm Sorry. All flights to Marquesas have been
canceled due to a weather system.

30:28.001 --> 30:33.370
But oh! but you can try and book a local room
at that counter.

30:35.293 --> 30:39.244
Um Do you have another way we can get there?

30:40.501 --> 30:43.250
Ernesto can fly you there.

30:43.376 --> 30:47.370
Who is Ernesto?
Ernesto Esteban Cruz.

30:48.626 --> 30:52.869
Like Penelope Cruz.
she won the Oscar.

30:54.376 --> 30:59.531
I checked the Doppler, machine checking storms
the storm heading south.

30:59.668 --> 31:03.329
It should miss Nuku Hiva
by a little short hair.

31:03.459 --> 31:08.413
Plus you get guided tour, a
private flight, and? free sandwiches.

31:08.543 --> 31:10.747
Ham and cheese.

31:12.543 --> 31:16.453
Um, should we try this?
Um, are you sure this is safe?

31:18.043 --> 31:21.539
I haven't lost a passenger yet.

31:31.793 --> 31:37.031
" If you look to your left you will see
the magnificent Hiva oan island. "

31:38.126 --> 31:40.828
"The second largest
in the Marquesas. "

31:43.251 --> 31:48.074
Um, "How much further?
'Ah the Beautiful island of Bora Bora"

31:48.210 --> 31:52.784
" Is coming up on your right,
belongs to little group of Society Islands. "

31:52.918 --> 31:57.291
Wait a minute Bora Bora is nowhere near Nuku Hiva.
Do we even know where we are?

31:57.418 --> 32:00.535
Not exactly,

32:01.168 --> 32:04.783
Would either of you like a sandwich?
I'm sorry. Did you say your intruments are down?

32:04.918 --> 32:08.782
Yes.
I have ham and cheese...

32:08.918 --> 32:10.790
Or just cheese.

32:12.335 --> 32:18.202
Are we gonna crash?
I dont like to use the term crash, it's negative.

32:18.335 --> 32:22.199
I Prefer the term "catastrophic failure".

32:22.335 --> 32:24.373
Oh my God! It is more professional.

32:25.293 --> 32:27.663
Wait for it, sit back!

35:50.253 --> 35:56.286
My Idea of a perfect Honeymoon is staying in a
primitive village, dancing barefoot under the moonlight.

35:56.420 --> 36:01.410
Somehow I dont see Brick going for that.
I'm not gonna marry Brick.

36:02.545 --> 36:06.325

If It was my honeymoon, I would'nt let
my husband out of the Bungalow. ooh!

38:24.921 --> 38:29.164

a little bit more romance into your marriage.

As long as it does'nt

Well I know how you can make it up to her.
Thanks, I'm good.

41:44.381 --> 41:49.169
there's a secluded cove about a mile away from here.
unbelievably romantic.

41:49.298 --> 41:53.872
You two could even swim naked if you wanted to. You know what
we'll probably stick with the pool. I dont think to wants to see...

41:54.006 --> 41:57.952
Here, I drew you a map.

41:58.090 --> 42:01.953
I guarantee it'll solve
all your problems.

42:07.131 --> 42:11.705
Hello, Mom.
I'm lonely. Being couped up here

42:11.840 --> 42:16.378
<i>It's about as much fun as a hemorrhoid. Maybe you should
have thought about that before you slappled a police officer.</i>

42:16.507 --> 42:20.963
I was'nt speeding,
he deserved it. hold on.

42:21.090 --> 42:26.790
Hey Dingle plumbing. but I'm not Walt, the kitchen
sink it smells like something crawled up there and died.

42:26.923 --> 42:30.455
Yeah, it would't be the first time.

42:30.590 --> 42:35.129
Why are you answering your phone anyway?
You should be bonking your wife.

42:35.965 --> 42:40.504
Ah mom, listen I told you that this was a business
arrangement, she's not even attracted to me.

42:40.632 --> 42:45.372
I was'nt attracted to your father but that did'nt stop me,
wham, bham, call the diaper man.

42:45.507 --> 42:48.837
Thats all I'm gonna say.

42:48.965 --> 42:52.165
That's all you had to say. Mom!

43:03.090 --> 43:06.586
- Hey.

43:08.674 --> 43:13.296
Can you put some sun screen on my back?
Yeah, of course.

43:18.757 --> 43:22.916
Look I'm sorry about last night.
I over reacted. like you know it was me!

43:23.049 --> 43:28.832
No no no, It was a stressful day for both of us.
Let's just pretend like it never happened, okay.

43:28.965 --> 43:31.632
Yeah, deal.

43:34.590 --> 43:37.672
You know I know where there's a really nice lagoon.
Okay!

43:39.341 --> 43:43.879
Yeah they say It's beautiful. It's private.
We can probably go skinny dipping

43:44.007 --> 43:48.215
We can just swim there...
whatever you'd like whatever want.

43:51.257 --> 43:53.746
How did you find out about this place?

43:53.882 --> 43:58.504
Um, honestly the waitress drew me a map she.

43:58.632 --> 44:04.581
She felt bad about what happened the other night
and said that we should come here. It'll be great.

44:04.716 --> 44:08.756
It's amazing.
Yeah, hold that, hold that.

<i>If you call the Police or any Authorities,
We will Kill her, We will text you the drop off.</i>

48:39.135 --> 48:44.918
<i>I'm a photographer, I dont have that kind of money.

48:50.010 --> 48:52.463
We should be okay now.

48:52.593 --> 48:55.295
Who are you?

48:55.426 --> 48:59.503
Where you taking me? Shut up.

49:06.260 --> 49:11.213

Well dont look at me.

49:12.510 --> 49:16.456
Oooh looks like it went well,
Somebody's kidnapped my wife. What!

49:16.593 --> 49:21.416
Yeah they took her from the lagoon, where you sent us,
What do you know about this? nothing. And who's she?

49:21.552 --> 49:25.759
I'm his girlfriend. Who are you?
You're not my girlfriend! okay

49:25.885 --> 49:29.049
Calm down! tell me what happened.

49:32.885 --> 49:35.456
Hi mate? how you doing.

49:37.427 --> 49:42.001
Your boy was in here last night dirty
dancing with one of the waitresses. Stupid!

49:42.135 --> 49:45.169
Gets worse.
Today I saw him take your woman into the jungle.

49:45.302 --> 49:49.342
Came back bare assed
with a couple of banana leaves over his doncer.

49:49.469 --> 49:52.751
This boy he's a real stud.

49:55.885 --> 50:00.875
And that pretty much sums it up.
I knew it, I knew the marriage was bogus.

50:01.010 --> 50:06.130
Nobody in their right mind would ever dump me. want to call the
Police, no, no, no, they said they'd kill her if I called anyone.

50:06.260 --> 50:10.585
Oh the always say that, I'd go for it, I mean.
What's the worst that could happen?

50:10.719 --> 50:14.547
She can die Tonya! You know,
I'm just trying to help! you dont have to yell.

50:14.677 --> 50:19.963
Where are you supposed to come up with 10 million dollars? I
do not know. The only person I can think of is my father in-law.

50:20.094 --> 50:25.628
Problem solved, can we order some room service.
cause I'm starving, Tonya! Shut up. Please.

50:26.677 --> 50:32.176
If Masha's father finds out that I took her, to this secluded
lagoon where she happened, to get kidnapped and I'm swimming naked...

50:32.302 --> 50:36.794
He's gonna have me totured and dismembered!
There's no way I can ask him for the Money.

50:36.927 --> 50:41.501
Then you only have one option.
Yeah and what's that.

50:42.802 --> 50:47.507
You have to rescue her, What am I Batman? No! I take pictures of
dogs dressed as fricking pirates for a living, I can't do that.

50:47.636 --> 50:51.132
I know the island inside and out,
so does my cousin. We could help you.

50:51.261 --> 50:53.927
Oh You could help me, thanks, No
you've helped me enough for one lifetime.

50:54.052 --> 50:56.671
You wanna blame this whole thing on me?
Maybe I should.

50:56.802 --> 51:00.843
Fine I was just wanted to make your marriage better.
It's obvious that you love her.

51:00.969 --> 51:05.377
No he does'nt. you heard him,
he's just helping her get her green card.

51:05.511 --> 51:08.213

51:08.344 --> 51:12.504
We can find her.
Besides what other choice do you have?

51:14.511 --> 51:18.172
<i>Open the Door. Go, go, go.</i>

51:18.303 --> 51:20.921
What are we supposed to do?

51:21.053 --> 51:24.632
<i>Open the door!</i>

51:29.636 --> 51:33.333
Hey, Brick. What brings you here?
Masha.

51:39.303 --> 51:43.427
Dont get the wrong idea.
I slept on the chair.

51:43.553 --> 51:46.421
I should kill you right now.

51:46.553 --> 51:48.923
Hurry up. Jump.

51:49.053 --> 51:52.418

So dont get any idea's.

52:09.636 --> 52:14.175

52:14.303 --> 52:18.000
I need to find my cousin.

52:18.136 --> 52:23.126
Buy some provisions. you think you can handle that?
I can out shop you any day sweetie.

52:27.845 --> 52:30.759
One last chance
Where is she?

52:30.887 --> 52:34.418
She's at the pool, she's at the pool.

52:34.553 --> 52:37.468
She'd better be.

53:04.137 --> 53:08.628
Where's Masha? Tellme the truth,
or I'll break you sweet little neck.

53:12.179 --> 53:14.418
My cousin's here.

53:14.554 --> 53:19.258
He and the waitress trying to rescue her.
That is all I know.

53:20.804 --> 53:23.755
There's my cousin.

53:34.762 --> 53:38.886
We need to re-think this whole plan. We're wasting
time. Ernesto can help us cover the whole Island.

53:39.012 --> 53:42.627
Oh Ernesto? that's right

He was looking for Sasha, Nashaa.

01:02:40.475 --> 01:02:43.177
Who's this guy Rambo?

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:52.008
You are so Primal.

01:02:58.683 --> 01:03:01.432
You know we still have tomorrow.

01:03:01.558 --> 01:03:07.591
There's a fishing village right around that point.
We can hike there after we get a little bit of rest.

01:03:07.725 --> 01:03:10.296
The locals might have seen something.

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.679
Why are you even helping me?
cause it's the right thing to do.

01:03:16.808 --> 01:03:19.297
And I owe you.

01:03:29.142 --> 01:03:34.723
Who-ever You are you have no idea, what your
getting yourselves into. Shut up! pathetic.

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:38.097
And your a spoilt little princess,
who needs to be taught a lesson. Oh.

01:03:39.642 --> 01:03:43.173
Hello! help somebody help me!

01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:45.595
Be quiet!

01:03:45.725 --> 01:03:48.296
I told you to leave her alone.

01:03:50.934 --> 01:03:53.304
Now dont move!

01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:02.595
Get up!

01:04:19.809 --> 01:04:23.554
Two Americans were here a couple a days ago.
in a four wheel drive.

01:04:23.684 --> 01:04:26.599
They bought few days worth of provisions,
and some heavy fishing line.

01:04:26.726 --> 01:04:31.015
Obviously they went fishing. They did'nt have poles,
and they drove into those mountains.

01:04:31.142 --> 01:04:33.678
Well they sound really stupid.

01:04:35.434 --> 01:04:39.973
The road Inland, passes an old compound,
where some surfers used to shape boards

01:04:40.101 --> 01:04:44.639
Somehow we missed it during the fly-over.
We could always fly back.

01:04:44.767 --> 01:04:48.975
We should hike in if we want to surprise them.
How long is that going to take?

01:04:49.101 --> 01:04:52.301
At least two hours.
Two hours! my God!

01:04:52.434 --> 01:04:56.345
Shut up! you shut up!
How do you know these guys are the kidnappers?

01:04:56.476 --> 01:05:00.221
Or whether there even staying at this place?
We dont, okay but do you have a better idea?

01:05:00.351 --> 01:05:05.553
I dont mean reading cosmo's
"10 best ways to treat a man Tonya. "

01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:09.465
At least I dont tickle the dog balls.
I did not tickle that dogs...

01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:13.760
Are you going with us or not?

01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:19.300
Fine. But I need to cool off. first

01:05:19.434 --> 01:05:21.923
Need to cool off first?

01:05:22.059 --> 01:05:24.762
Makes a good point?

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:41.635
His words make sense.

01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:53.715
Escuse me.

01:06:01.851 --> 01:06:04.885
What are think our odds are honestly?

01:06:05.018 --> 01:06:08.514
If you want to live.
What else are you gonna do

01:06:10.018 --> 01:06:12.969
It's not about me not anymore.

01:06:27.518 --> 01:06:32.341
Dah!, Did you call the police?
No they said they'd kill her.

01:06:32.477 --> 01:06:36.387
Look I know I should have to call sooner but Ah...

01:06:36.518 --> 01:06:40.464
The truth is, that I think I really love your
daughter. and right now that's all I care about.

01:06:42.435 --> 01:06:45.054
I'm trying to find her, but um...

01:06:46.893 --> 01:06:52.096
Right now the odds kinda suck.

01:07:07.727 --> 01:07:12.847

spotted on the other side of the island.

01:07:12.977 --> 01:07:16.508
Lighthouse called, asked me wire ransom,
He's behind this as we thought.

01:07:16.644 --> 01:07:20.933
And he'll pay with his life!
She is only child.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.011

01:07:25.102 --> 01:07:28.717

01:07:35.686 --> 01:07:41.931
Chopper never come back so were good to go.
She's fine, any problem your end?

01:07:42.061 --> 01:07:44.596
Nothing I cant handle.

01:07:50.644 --> 01:07:55.301
Um, I'd hate to interrupt your club Med vacation,
but I think we should get going.

01:07:55.436 --> 01:07:57.924

01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:05.090

01:08:21.435 --> 01:08:27.799
Listen cousin, it was'nt my idea
that when a man gets older he becomes more attractive.

01:08:27.935 --> 01:08:33.055
And that it does'nt work that way.
For woman.

01:09:56.853 --> 01:09:59.223
Hey!, I need to get to the bathroom!

01:10:02.395 --> 01:10:05.559
Take care of it, keep your hands off her.

01:10:06.645 --> 01:10:08.719
Yeah, fine.

01:10:21.812 --> 01:10:24.265

01:11:27.729 --> 01:11:30.478
In the mountains?

01:11:31.396 --> 01:11:37.262

01:16:59.732 --> 01:17:02.351

Who is behind this? who kidnapped you?

01:18:40.566 --> 01:18:42.059

01:18:47.108 --> 01:18:48.849
Hello, hello Masha?

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.604
No more mistakes!

01:19:06.691 --> 01:19:10.732
My dad took me on a canoe trip once.
there's slightly less shooting involved.

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:17.018
What really happened to your father?

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:22.933
He was in Artico...

01:19:23.066 --> 01:19:25.555
And got attacked by!

01:19:27.233 --> 01:19:31.097
Penguins. They are not
as cute as everybody thinks.

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:36.732
You know how hard it was for me to put on a tuxedo,
at our wedding.

01:19:36.858 --> 01:19:41.681
The second I looked into the mirror,
all I could think about was him fighting them off.

01:19:50.108 --> 01:19:52.513
- You...
- Okay!, Okay!, He's alive!

01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:55.767
But he left us a long time ago.
I do not know him.

01:19:55.900 --> 01:20:00.806
<i>But my mother is crazy. she's under
house arrest, and Oh! Wait a minute.</i>

01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:05.065
- What?
- Do you hear that?

01:20:06.983 --> 01:20:09.732
What are they saying?

01:20:09.858 --> 01:20:13.022
I dont know, I think they want us to paddle over.

01:20:13.150 --> 01:20:16.681
I can't believe a place like this still exists.

01:20:26.358 --> 01:20:31.063
Do you have any idea what he's saying? Not really.
But he seems friendly. Maybe he can help us.

01:20:35.817 --> 01:20:38.980
Um! bad guys, need help.
Do you have a phone?

01:20:39.109 --> 01:20:45.058
Yeah! Do you have a phone, Like an
iPhone or Blackberry? Like uh!

01:21:56.401 --> 01:21:58.475
May I?

01:22:14.526 --> 01:22:19.728
You look amazing.
You clean up well yourself.

01:22:22.026 --> 01:22:27.774
Dancing under the moonlight in a jungle village.
It's pretty much your ideal honeymoon?

01:22:29.443 --> 01:22:32.524
Is it yours?

01:22:32.651 --> 01:22:35.436
Will you marry me?

01:22:36.943 --> 01:22:40.688
Sorry, but, I'm already married.

01:23:31.027 --> 01:23:35.684
It was third one I was most proud of.
I did'nt cry that time.

01:23:44.693 --> 01:23:46.684
Let's go.

01:23:53.568 --> 01:23:56.235
- Isn't this amazing?
- Yeah.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:59.975
If only we would have some jungle cappuccino.

01:24:04.902 --> 01:24:10.934
Oh no, no, I was kidding. No Coffee...

01:24:21.319 --> 01:24:23.226
So, good!

01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:31.681
You two got to get the hell outta here! hum,

01:24:31.819 --> 01:24:35.149

I used to work in Wall Street long story.

01:24:54.277 --> 01:24:56.019
Grab the leaf, got it alright get on!

01:25:11.361 --> 01:25:12.937
Alright! go, go, go!

01:25:52.403 --> 01:25:55.899
Move away from her!
No, no,no, he's gonna kill you!

01:25:56.028 --> 01:25:59.524
Move, If you want her to live!
Okay, Okay!

01:26:09.153 --> 01:26:13.894
You okay Masha?
Dont try to say you save me, you hired him.

01:26:14.028 --> 01:26:16.599
What? I would never.

01:26:16.736 --> 01:26:19.225
I thought you loved me. I do.

01:26:19.361 --> 01:26:22.857
Then at least show some respect and be honest.

01:26:25.861 --> 01:26:28.563
Did they treat you well?

01:26:28.695 --> 01:26:32.143
Why would you do this?
Because I'm ambitious.

01:26:32.278 --> 01:26:36.770
Like your father. I thought that's what women like in a man?
So you use his own daughter to steal from him?

01:26:36.903 --> 01:26:40.600
I did it for us, there is no us.
We're getting married Masha, it's all been decided!

01:26:40.736 --> 01:26:43.439
I would'ny marry you,
if you were the last man on this planet.

01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:47.978
You're sick, Violent and Dillusional.
I've never loved you. and I never will, Okay!

01:26:48.112 --> 01:26:51.358
I dont think, honestys the best policy
right now.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.944
What about this then?

01:26:57.945 --> 01:26:58.940
Your new husband he's the kidnapper not me?
and I shot him

01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:03.313
But not before I could stop him,
throwing you over the edge of the cliff.

01:27:03.445 --> 01:27:08.102
A tragic ending!

01:27:15.112 --> 01:27:17.351
There they are!

01:27:51.279 --> 01:27:53.981
The honeymoon is officially over!

01:28:03.404 --> 01:28:04.861
No!

01:28:04.987 --> 01:28:07.143
My God!

01:28:28.154 --> 01:28:30.477

01:29:01.029 --> 01:29:04.608
<i>Senor, let me.

I'm Okay, Mom, I'm okay.

01:29:31.738 --> 01:29:35.814
You saved my daughter.
You save me $10 million US Dollars.

01:29:35.946 --> 01:29:38.648
You exposed Brickland as traitor.

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:45.899
That sound like a good reason to shoot you in
the head! I dont think so. Hah,Hah hah, hah...

01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:56.023
My wife say you have
our blessing to stay married.

Masha, I love you so much.

01:30:24.947 --> 01:30:28.063
But I can not be married
into this family.

01:30:47.613 --> 01:30:50.979
No, let him go.

01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:20.904
Come on darling lap it up? Hey um get it.

01:31:27.905 --> 01:31:31.946
What! Mom? Just because i'm under house arrest.
You does'nt mean you have to be.

01:31:32.072 --> 01:31:36.362
<i>Oh! Come on, Mom. you really need to get out.
Please just dont start.</i>

01:31:36.489 --> 01:31:40.150
- How are you feeling?
- Never better. Your miserable

01:31:40.281 --> 01:31:44.938
Pull your head out of your rear end and do something
about this. It's not that complicated.

01:31:45.072 --> 01:31:47.229
That's all I'm gonna say.

01:31:55.197 --> 01:31:57.603
You up for a double dip?

01:32:04.614 --> 01:32:07.980
Something wrong? It compli...

No. It's not.

01:33:46.907 --> 01:33:51.481
