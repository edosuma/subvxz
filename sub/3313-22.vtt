00:08.008 --> 00:09.629
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.630 --> 00:10.800
OH, WHAT A PERFECT MORNING.

00:10.801 --> 00:12.472
I'VE GOT MY MAN,
I'VE GOT MY NEPHEW,

00:12.473 --> 00:14.514
HE HAS HIS GIRLFRIEND,
AND SHE HAS HER BABY.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.806
THAT'S RIGHT. AND I GOT
MY FARM FRESH RICOTTA.

00:16.807 --> 00:18.398
OH, WHICH MEANS LATER ON I'M
GONNA HAVE A GREAT LASAGNA.

00:18.399 --> 00:19.849
THIS DAY JUST GETS
BETTER AND BETTER.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.231
OH, LOOK. FREE SMOOTHIE SAMPLES.

00:21.232 --> 00:22.642
GET THE KALE ONE. IT'S THE BEST.

00:22.643 --> 00:23.903
WITH A SHOT OF KELP.

00:23.904 --> 00:26.696
MOMMY, THIS TASTES
LIKE MEDICINE.

00:26.697 --> 00:28.818
OH, AND NOW WE KNOW
WHY THOSE ARE FREE.

00:28.819 --> 00:30.610
- WOULD YOU?
- SURE, YEAH.

00:30.611 --> 00:32.652
I'M LICENSED TO DRIVE
ONE OF THESE THINGS.

00:32.653 --> 00:35.495
OH, WHAT AN ADORABLE BABY.

00:35.496 --> 00:37.036
YOU MUST BE SO PROUD.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.619
OH, WELL, WHILE SHE IS
ADORABLE ENOUGH TO BE MINE,

00:39.620 --> 00:40.790
ACTUALLY STELLA HERE IS THE MOM.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.753
OH. SO THAT MAKES YOU
THE PROUD GRAND...

00:43.754 --> 00:44.965
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE,
DO NOT SAY THAT.

00:47.468 --> 00:49.509
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
GETTING TIRED, HUH?

00:49.510 --> 00:50.800
YEAH.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.842
HEY, WE'LL MEET YOU GUYS
BACK AT THE HOUSE, OKAY?

00:52.843 --> 00:55.845
THAT IS, IF I DON'T GET PULLED
OVER FOR SPEEDING FIRST.

00:55.846 --> 00:57.637
ALL RIGHT, ISABEL, YOU
READY TO RIDE SHOTGUN?

00:57.638 --> 00:59.889
HERE WE GO! VROOM VROOM!

00:59.890 --> 01:02.232
WELL, RYDER SURE IS
GOOD WITH THAT BABY.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.814
YEAH, WELL, HE AND ISABEL
HAVE SIMILAR INTERESTS...

01:04.815 --> 01:06.856
NAPS AND BOOBS.

01:06.857 --> 01:09.239
- ( dog barking )
- LOOK, JOE. DOG ADOPTIONS.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.450
OH, LOOK AT THIS LITTLE GUY.

01:10.451 --> 01:11.821
HE IS SO CUTE.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.533
YEAH, HE'S ADORABLE.

01:13.534 --> 01:16.326
USE SOME HAND SANITIZER. WE
MIGHT BE TOUCHING LATER.

01:16.327 --> 01:18.958
IT'S SO SAD. HE'S AN ORPHAN.

01:18.959 --> 01:21.541
( British accent ) PLEASE,
SIR, MAY I HAVE A HOME?

01:21.542 --> 01:23.793
LOOK, HE FITS IN
MY ARMS PERFECTLY,

01:23.794 --> 01:25.205
AND HE ALREADY KNOWS MY NAME.

01:25.206 --> 01:26.796
"BURKE! BURKE BURKE BURKE!"

01:26.797 --> 01:28.128
COME ON. LET'S TAKE HIM.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.969
- NO.
- WHY NOT?

01:29.970 --> 01:31.471
YOU WANT ALL 500 REASONS,

01:31.472 --> 01:32.802
OR JUST THE TOP TWO?

01:32.803 --> 01:33.973
ALL RIGHT, NUMBER ONE,

01:33.974 --> 01:35.385
YOU'RE GONE ALL DAY AT WORK,

01:35.386 --> 01:36.636
AND NUMBER TWO, I
AM NOT BABYSITTING

01:36.637 --> 01:37.637
YOUR SHEDDING FURBALL.

01:37.638 --> 01:40.890
( gasps ) HE CAN HEAR YOU.

01:40.891 --> 01:42.482
COME ON. IT'S REALLY
NOT THE RIGHT TIME

01:42.483 --> 01:43.893
FOR YOU AND ME TO
BE ADOPTING A DOG.

01:43.894 --> 01:45.024
YOU CAN SEE THAT, RIGHT?

01:45.025 --> 01:46.396
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.817
IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME NOW.

01:47.818 --> 01:49.819
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, BUDDY,
IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S US.

01:49.820 --> 01:52.282
WELL, MOSTLY HIM.

01:52.283 --> 01:54.494
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:54.495 --> 01:56.286
HE IS GONNA FIND THE
PERFECT HOME, OKAY?

01:56.287 --> 01:57.288
I CAN FEEL IT.

01:58.949 --> 02:02.583
JOE, LOOK WHO FOUND
THE PERFECT HOME.

02:26.857 --> 02:28.648
MEL, HONEY, I THOUGHT
WE TALKED AND AGREED

02:28.649 --> 02:29.649
THAT WE WEREN'T GETTING A DOG.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.941
"I'M WENDELL." ( chuckles )

02:31.942 --> 02:33.983
OH, JEEZ. YOU NAMED IT?

02:33.984 --> 02:36.616
LOOK, WE DIDN'T GET A DOG.
I GOT A DOG.

02:36.617 --> 02:38.778
AND WENDELL HERE IS NOW A
PART OF THAT INDEPENDENT

02:38.779 --> 02:40.370
JOE-FREE PORTION OF MY LIFE,

02:40.371 --> 02:42.041
WHICH INCLUDES THOUSAND
ISLAND DRESSING

02:42.042 --> 02:44.043
AND WATCHING "THE VIEW."

02:44.044 --> 02:46.786
BUT, MEL, AFTER CAREFUL
CONSIDERATION AND LOGIC,

02:46.787 --> 02:48.498
WE DECIDED IT WASN'T
THE BEST TIME.

02:48.499 --> 02:49.709
THAT WAS YOUR DECISION.

02:49.710 --> 02:51.791
MY DECISION WAS BASED
ON HOW CUTE HE IS.

02:51.792 --> 02:53.503
OH, YEAH. OH, WATCH THIS.

02:53.504 --> 02:55.795
- HEY.
- ( toy squeaks )

02:55.796 --> 02:57.557
WENDELL, KILL THE PIG.
KILL THE PIG.

02:57.558 --> 02:58.559
- ( growling )
- COME ON.

03:01.562 --> 03:03.142
WOW, SO AT LEAST WE KNOW
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SAFE

03:03.143 --> 03:05.184
IF WE EVER HAPPENED TO
BE ATTACKED BY TOY PIGS.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.066
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, MEL.

03:07.067 --> 03:09.689
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO CARE FOR THIS
COMPLETELY UNTRAINED ANIMAL

03:09.690 --> 03:11.811
WHEN YOU'RE DOWN IN CITY
HALL ALL DAY DOING...

03:11.812 --> 03:13.653
WHATEVER THE HELL IT
IS YOU DO DOWN THERE?

03:13.654 --> 03:17.196
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST FINDING
PROBLEMS THAT DON'T EXIST.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.198
THERE ARE DOG-SITTERS
ON EVERY STREET CORNER

03:19.199 --> 03:20.370
JUST WAITING TO BE CALLED.

03:20.371 --> 03:22.782
THOSE ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE.

03:22.783 --> 03:24.784
THERE ARE TEENAGERS
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

03:24.785 --> 03:27.457
THAT WOULD PAY ME TO LOOK AFTER
AN ADORABLE DOG LIKE WENDELL.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.379
- WE'LL FIND SOMEBODY.
- YEAH, AND WHAT IF WE DON'T?

03:29.380 --> 03:31.331
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
NOT A DOG PERSON.

03:31.332 --> 03:32.792
WHAT?!

03:32.793 --> 03:34.794
WHO ARE YOU?

03:34.795 --> 03:38.007
I DIDN'T JUST SAY
I OWNED SLAVES.

03:38.008 --> 03:39.299
I'M JUST NOT A BIG FAN OF ANYONE

03:39.300 --> 03:41.841
WHO WIPES THEIR
BUTT ON THE CARPET.

03:41.842 --> 03:42.932
WELL, DON'T WORRY, JOE.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.304
I PROMISE YOU'LL NEVER
HAVE TO LIFT A FINGER

03:44.305 --> 03:46.896
TO CARE OF THIS ADORABLE
BUNDLE OF UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.

03:46.897 --> 03:48.899
OH, LOOK. HOW CAN YOU
HATE A FACE LIKE THAT?

03:51.942 --> 03:53.774
( whirring loudly )

03:55.776 --> 03:57.777
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TO THE BABY?

03:57.778 --> 03:59.619
I'VE GOT THE HEAT
SETTING ON LOW.

03:59.620 --> 04:02.952
HOW DID YOU END UP PUTTING
A HAIR DRYER ON HER?

04:02.953 --> 04:04.033
OKAY, SO FIRST,

04:04.034 --> 04:05.705
I SHARED MY GUACAMOLE
WITH HER, RIGHT?

04:05.706 --> 04:07.747
OKAY, I'M ALL CAUGHT UP.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.789
SHE OVERFLOWED HER
DIAPER THREE TIMES,

04:09.790 --> 04:12.332
SO I HAD TO GIVE HER
A BATH IN THE SINK.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.374
YOU MOVED ALL THE DISHES OUT
OF THERE FIRST THOUGH, RIGHT?

04:14.375 --> 04:16.336
THEY WEREN'T IN THE WAY.

04:16.337 --> 04:18.217
AND WE'RE GETTING NEW DISHES.

04:18.218 --> 04:20.800
ANYWAY, SHE WENT
THROUGH FOUR OUTFITS,

04:20.801 --> 04:22.552
AND I WENT THROUGH TWO,

04:22.553 --> 04:25.144
SO FIGURED THIS MADE THE
MOST SENSE TO WEAR.

04:25.145 --> 04:27.847
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO
KEEP VOLUNTEERING TO WATCH HER, MAN.

04:27.848 --> 04:29.649
STELLA HAD MARCHING BAND
PRACTICE, ALL RIGHT?

04:29.650 --> 04:31.230
IF I HADN'T HELPED,

04:31.231 --> 04:32.942
SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO DROP OUT.

04:32.943 --> 04:35.395
OKAY, I JUST GOT A
WAFT OF SOMETHING.

04:35.396 --> 04:36.656
WAS THAT YOU OR HER?

04:36.657 --> 04:38.608
I HOPE IT WAS ME.

04:38.609 --> 04:39.780
YEAH, IT WAS ME.

04:41.201 --> 04:43.613
I JUST MET WENDELL, OUR NEW DOG.

04:43.614 --> 04:45.705
UH, IT'S NOT OUR DOG.
IT'S YOUR AUNT'S DOG.

04:45.706 --> 04:46.996
ALL RIGHT? SHE'S GONNA BE
THE ONE TAKING CARE OF IT.

04:46.997 --> 04:48.708
I JUST POSTED THIS ON INSTAGRAM,

04:48.709 --> 04:49.869
AND LOOK AT HOW
MANY LIKES HE GOT.

04:49.870 --> 04:51.290
EVERYBODY LIKES HIM.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.413
NOT EVERYBODY.

04:53.414 --> 04:55.294
OH, LOOK AT THOSE EARS.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.756
HE'S ADORABLE.

04:56.757 --> 04:58.087
MMM.

04:58.088 --> 04:59.799
HEY, WHAT ABOUT
LITTLE ISABEL HERE?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.220
I'D SAY SHE'S PRETTY CUTE.

05:01.221 --> 05:03.222
( squirting )

05:03.223 --> 05:04.634
OH, MAN!

05:04.635 --> 05:07.017
THIS IS MY LAST CLEAN SWIMSUIT.

05:11.231 --> 05:12.643
( whimpers )

05:15.936 --> 05:17.937
STOP LOOKING AT ME.
I'M NOT YOUR OWNER.

05:17.938 --> 05:20.029
MORNING, JOE.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.031
- SEE YOU, JOE.
- HEY, WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.

05:22.032 --> 05:24.744
WHERE'S THAT DOG-SITTER
THAT YOUR AUNT HIRED?

05:24.745 --> 05:26.366
OH, RIGHT. NATALIE JUST CALLED.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.908
HER MOM CAUGHT HER IN THE
SHOWER WITH HER BOYFRIEND,

05:28.909 --> 05:31.952
AND WHEN I SAY HER BOYFRIEND,
I MEAN HER MOM'S BOYFRIEND.

05:33.253 --> 05:34.624
SO ANYWAY, SHE GOT GROUNDED

05:34.625 --> 05:36.666
AND ISN'T COMING.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.878
WHO'S GONNA BE TAKING CARE
OF YOUR AUNT'S DOG THEN?

05:38.879 --> 05:39.879
CAN YOU DO SOMETHING
TO HELP OUT?

05:39.880 --> 05:42.221
I ALREADY TWEETED LIKE
A HUNDRED PICTURES

05:42.222 --> 05:43.803
OF HIM DOING REALLY CUTE STUFF.

05:43.804 --> 05:46.015
OH, YOU DID? THAT'S NOT HELPING.

05:46.016 --> 05:47.226
NO, IT IS, OKAY?

05:47.227 --> 05:49.228
I TWEETED "BOY, DID
I HAVE A RUFF DAY."

05:49.229 --> 05:50.309
( chuckles )

05:50.310 --> 05:51.812
THAT'S CUTE, HUH?

05:53.233 --> 05:54.815
I HAVE A CLASS. GOOD LUCK.

05:56.977 --> 05:57.858
LENNOX?

06:00.030 --> 06:01.481
( whimpers )

06:01.482 --> 06:04.193
WHAT, YOU THINK YOU
CAN WIN ME OVER, HUH?

06:04.194 --> 06:05.906
REALLY?

06:07.618 --> 06:08.749
YOU'RE A RAT WITH A COLLAR.

06:10.911 --> 06:12.622
( cellphone ringing )

06:12.623 --> 06:13.913
- HEY, JOE.
- MEL, LISTEN...

06:13.914 --> 06:15.374
LOOK, WE'RE IN THE
MIDDLE OF A MEETING.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.916
WE'RE ABOUT TO VOTE ON A
VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.548
I VOTE THE FALAFEL PLACE.

06:18.549 --> 06:20.960
WE DID INDIAN LAST WEEK.

06:20.961 --> 06:23.212
HEY, MEL, I HATE TO BE
ONE OF THOSE BOYFRIENDS

06:23.213 --> 06:24.804
WHO SAYS "I SAW THIS COMING,"

06:24.805 --> 06:25.965
BUT DAY ONE, DAY ONE,

06:25.966 --> 06:27.807
DOGGIE DAY CARE
IS OFF THE RAILS.

06:27.808 --> 06:28.888
BUT I BOOKED NATALIE.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.059
YEAH, NATALIE'S STUCK
IN THE SHOWER.

06:30.060 --> 06:32.061
SHE AIN'T COMING.

06:32.062 --> 06:34.143
ALL RIGHT? SO WHAT DO YOU PLAN
TO DO FOR YOUR DOG TODAY?

06:34.144 --> 06:35.475
OOH, CAN YOU PUT WENDELL ON?

06:35.476 --> 06:37.437
I WANT TO TELL HIM I WUV HIM.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.019
UH, NO. HE'S BUSY RIGHT NOW.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.400
WHAT'S HE DOING?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.403
SOMETHING I CAN'T.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.985
WHEN ARE YOU GETTING HOME?

06:45.986 --> 06:48.027
JOE, I'M REALLY STUCK.
I'M BEGGING YOU.

06:48.028 --> 06:49.699
WATCH WENDELL FOR ONE DAY.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.120
- NO, I CAN'T.
- THANKS.

06:51.121 --> 06:52.792
OOH, YOU'RE THE BEST
BOYFRIEND EVER.

06:52.793 --> 06:54.203
MEL.

06:54.204 --> 06:56.205
( sighs )

06:56.206 --> 06:59.799
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU LIKE
ENTERTAINING YOURSELF, PAL.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.922
'CAUSE YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN
FOR THE REST OF TODAY.

07:06.807 --> 07:08.968
( barks )

07:08.969 --> 07:10.640
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:10.641 --> 07:11.931
FORGET IT, ALL RIGHT?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.853
( barking )

07:13.854 --> 07:17.016
I'M NOT OPENING THE...

07:17.017 --> 07:18.559
ALL RIGHT, YOU PAIN
IN THE ASS, LET'S GO.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.529
SORRY I'M A FEW MINUTES LATE.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.531
YEAH.

07:31.532 --> 07:32.782
23 MINUTES, ACTUALLY, FRANK,

07:32.783 --> 07:34.784
BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

07:34.785 --> 07:36.786
ANYWAY, WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN WE
THE TIME WE HAVE LEFT, ALL RIGHT?

07:36.787 --> 07:38.708
WE'RE GONNA START WITH BICEPS.
THREE SETS OF HAMMER CURLS.

07:38.709 --> 07:39.919
HEY, YOU GOT A DOG.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.130
DOES HE HAVE A NAME?

07:41.131 --> 07:43.543
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I CALL HIM.

07:43.544 --> 07:45.134
AND IF HE KNOWS
WHAT'S GOOD FOR HIM,

07:45.135 --> 07:46.135
HE'S GONNA STAY OUT
OF MY WAY TODAY.

07:46.136 --> 07:47.386
- ( whimpers )
- YEAH.

07:47.387 --> 07:49.138
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE IN.

07:49.139 --> 07:50.469
HAMMERS.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.972
READY, GO. ONE, TWO...

07:52.973 --> 07:54.143
COME ON NOW, YOU ONLY GOT
ONE MORE SET AFTER THIS.

07:54.144 --> 07:55.474
WE'RE GOING TILL FAIL.
COME ON, FIVE MORE.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.186
YOU CAN DO THIS.

07:57.187 --> 07:59.438
YOU CAN PROBABLY DO THIS.
OKAY, COME ON.

07:59.439 --> 08:01.150
- GOOD.
- HEY, JOE.

08:01.151 --> 08:02.401
BLAKE, HEY LOOK,

08:02.402 --> 08:04.273
CAN YOU JUST HANG OUT
FOR A COUPLE MINUTES?

08:04.274 --> 08:06.696
- I'M RUNNING A LITTLE BEHIND.
- I'M ON A REALLY TIGHT SCHEDULE.

08:06.697 --> 08:08.157
I KNOW, HE JUST
HAS ONE MORE SET.

08:08.158 --> 08:10.449
WHEN I SAY NOON, I MEAN NOON.

08:10.450 --> 08:12.532
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO SIT
AROUND AND WAIT FOR SOME...

08:12.533 --> 08:15.535
( gasps ) CUTE LITTLE PUPPY!

08:15.536 --> 08:17.076
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

08:17.077 --> 08:18.958
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU...
- DON'T YOU DARE!

08:18.959 --> 08:20.920
WELL, AREN'T YOU THE
SWEETEST THING?

08:20.921 --> 08:22.171
OH, GOODNESS.

08:22.172 --> 08:23.963
NO! YOU'RE DONE, YOU'RE DONE!

08:23.964 --> 08:25.424
WILL YOU STOP LIFTING?

08:25.425 --> 08:28.087
TAKE YOUR TIME. WE ARE GOOD.

08:28.088 --> 08:29.178
HEY...

08:29.179 --> 08:31.130
THE DOG'S BABY-SITTING
YOUR CLIENTS FOR YOU.

08:31.131 --> 08:32.512
YOU OUGHT TO GIVE HIM A RAISE.

08:34.134 --> 08:36.135
THANKS FOR BABY-SITTING
AGAIN, RYDER.

08:36.136 --> 08:39.188
YEAH, ISABEL AND I HAD TIME
TO WORK ON OUR PEEK-A-BOO.

08:39.189 --> 08:40.810
SHE FOUND ME EVERY TIME.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.732
RIGHT BEHIND THE HANDS, RIGHT?

08:42.733 --> 08:44.313
( coos )

08:44.314 --> 08:45.524
OH, IMPRESSIVE.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.737
YOU AND I CAN PEEK-A-BOO
ALL DAY TOMORROW.

08:47.738 --> 08:49.528
DON'T YOU HAVE THAT
MARCHING BAND TRIP?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.701
IT'S AN AMUSEMENT PARK WITH
ROLLER COASTERS, RYDER.

08:51.702 --> 08:54.533
I CAN'T TAKE ISABEL. SHE
PUKES ENOUGH AS IT IS.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.286
WELL, IF YOU WANT
I CAN WATCH HER.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.537
NO NO, I COULDN'T
LET YOU DO THAT

08:58.538 --> 08:59.709
THREE DAYS IN A ROW.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.871
BESIDES, YOU AND I HAVE
A DATE TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:01.872 --> 09:04.043
YEAH, I KNOW. BUT WE CAN GO
ON A DATE WHEN YOU GET BACK.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.545
COME ON, ISABEL AND I GOT A
GOOD THING GOING ON HERE.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.928
WE'RE ON SEASON TWO
OF "THE SOPRANOS,"

09:08.929 --> 09:11.631
BUT A LOT OF IT JUST GOES
RIGHT OVER HER HEAD.

09:11.632 --> 09:12.973
HERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

09:15.976 --> 09:17.727
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?
- POSITIVE.

09:17.728 --> 09:21.311
OH, YOU'RE THE BEST. I WISH
I KNEW HOW TO THANK YOU.

09:24.645 --> 09:26.896
BET YOU COULD THINK OF A FEW
WAYS SHE COULD THANK YOU.

09:26.897 --> 09:29.148
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

09:29.149 --> 09:30.489
( chuckles )

09:30.490 --> 09:31.861
OHH.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.533
I HAVE NO ULTERIOR MOTIVES
FOR BABY-SITTING, JOE.

09:34.534 --> 09:36.195
RYDER, STOP IT. COME
ON, IT'S JUST US GUYS.

09:36.196 --> 09:37.246
YOU CAN BE HONEST.

09:37.247 --> 09:39.118
WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY NO

09:39.119 --> 09:42.121
IF STELLA DECIDED TO REWARD ME

09:42.122 --> 09:43.412
IN SOME MEANINGFUL WAY.

09:43.413 --> 09:45.504
MM-HMM.

09:45.505 --> 09:47.628
I REALLY WANT A REWARD.

09:48.969 --> 09:50.420
WELCOME TO THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE, BUDDY.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.847
HERE, I GUESS YOU
EARNED ONE TODAY.

09:57.848 --> 09:58.928
( door opens )

09:58.929 --> 10:01.981
- HEY, ADORABLE.
- HEY, MEL.

10:01.982 --> 10:04.223
HI, JOE.

10:04.224 --> 10:05.645
LOOK, I GOT YOU A PRESENT.

10:05.646 --> 10:08.648
YOU GOT ME A PRESENT?
WHAT'D YOU GET ME?

10:08.649 --> 10:10.189
YOU GOT ME A...

10:10.190 --> 10:11.280
FIVE PACK OF BEER?

10:11.281 --> 10:13.112
IT'S A LONG WALK
UP THE DRIVEWAY.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.944
THIS IS TOP-SHELF MICROBREW.

10:14.945 --> 10:16.325
BECAUSE I AM GENUINELY
APPRECIATIVE OF YOU

10:16.326 --> 10:17.997
WATCHING WENDELL FOR ME ALL DAY.

10:17.998 --> 10:19.538
YEAH, WELL, IT WAS A STRUGGLE,

10:19.539 --> 10:21.120
BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO DO IT.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.872
WELL, I'VE GOT BUDGETS TO READ,

10:22.873 --> 10:24.293
SO I AM GONNA TAKE WENDELL,

10:24.294 --> 10:26.455
WHO IS MY RESPONSIBILITY
AND MY LOVE MUFFIN,

10:26.456 --> 10:27.707
UP TO MY ROOM.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.959
OH, AND YOU GET TO SLEEP
OVER TOMORROW NIGHT.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.511
I'M THERE FOR THAT.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.676
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG? OH,
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.557
OH YEAH. YOU WANT THIS.

10:38.558 --> 10:40.559
- ( growling )
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

10:40.560 --> 10:41.560
YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR FAVORITE TOY?

10:41.561 --> 10:43.142
( growls )

10:43.143 --> 10:44.974
YOU BROKE MY DOG.

10:44.975 --> 10:46.645
WHAT? THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.067
NO, I DIDN'T. WE
JUST HUNG OUT TODAY.

10:48.068 --> 10:49.068
HE WATCHED ME TRAIN A FEW PEOPLE

10:49.069 --> 10:50.109
AND WE WENT FOR A RUN.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.771
COME HERE, BUDDY.
COME HERE, COME HERE.

10:51.772 --> 10:54.323
- THERE WE GO.
- OH, I GET WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

10:54.324 --> 10:56.115
YEAH, YOU'RE TIRED AND CRANKY

10:56.116 --> 10:58.447
BECAUSE THE SCARY MAN
MADE YOU GO FOR A RUN.

10:58.448 --> 11:00.659
MOMMY WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
OH, NO SHE WOULDN'T.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.491
OH, NO SHE WOULDN'T.

11:02.492 --> 11:05.125
I THINK EVEN THE DOG THINKS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS ANNOYING.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.548
NO, HE DOESN'T. OH,
NO HE DOESN'T.

11:21.141 --> 11:23.143
MEL.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.976
LISTEN, SWEETIE, I DON'T
WANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

11:26.977 --> 11:28.647
BUT NEXT TIME YOU COME
IN HERE, COULD YOU MAYBE

11:28.648 --> 11:30.650
USE A LITTLE MOUTHWASH?

11:32.943 --> 11:34.944
Mel: JOE, HAVE YOU SEEN WENDELL?

11:34.945 --> 11:38.318
JOE, HOW COULD YOU?!

11:40.951 --> 11:42.701
THIS IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.663
HE'S IN YOUR BED. WHAT
ELSE COULD IT BE?

11:44.664 --> 11:45.995
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS IN HERE.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.207
YEAH. YOU DELIBERATELY
STOLE MY DOG'S AFFECTIONS,

11:48.208 --> 11:51.831
AND AFTER I WAS KIND ENOUGH TO
LET YOU PLAY WITH HIM ALL DAY.

11:51.832 --> 11:54.173
I'M SORRY, YOU LET
ME PLAY WITH HIM?

11:54.174 --> 11:56.135
YES. YEAH. BUT I HAD NO IDEA

11:56.136 --> 11:57.677
YOU'D TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF AN INNOCENT ANIMAL.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.013
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED IN HERE?

12:04.014 --> 12:05.724
I BET THE WHOLE TIME
YOU WERE ON THE PHONE

12:05.725 --> 12:07.056
COMPLAINING ABOUT
HOW BUSY YOU WERE,

12:07.057 --> 12:08.687
YOU WERE REALLY RUBBING
WENDELL'S TUMMY.

12:08.688 --> 12:11.060
THAT'S MY TUMMY.

12:11.061 --> 12:12.231
YOU KNOW WHAT, MEL? THERE
WERE SEVERAL REASONS

12:12.232 --> 12:13.272
WHY I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET THIS DOG.

12:13.273 --> 12:15.194
AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM.
HE'S COMING BETWEEN US.

12:15.195 --> 12:17.066
NO, APPARENTLY I'M THE
ONE COMING BETWEEN THIS

12:17.067 --> 12:18.948
B.F.F. SLEEPOVER.

12:18.949 --> 12:20.239
YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.411
STAY HERE WITH YOUR
LITTLE FRIEND.

12:22.412 --> 12:23.572
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

12:23.573 --> 12:25.364
HE TOLD ME HE HATES
YOUR ENTIRE SPECIES.

12:25.365 --> 12:27.537
HUH? YEAH. THINK ABOUT THAT.

12:29.419 --> 12:31.461
MEL, COME ON.

12:35.545 --> 12:37.007
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU THEN.

12:45.475 --> 12:47.386
- HEY.
- HEY, THERE SHE IS.

12:47.387 --> 12:48.808
LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK.
COME HERE.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.099
LET ME TAKE THOSE BAGS FROM YOU.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.811
TAKE A LOAD OFF. YOUR
FEET MUST BE KILLING YOU

12:51.812 --> 12:54.894
AFTER A LONG, ARDUOUS DAY
OF SHOPPING IN THE MALL.

12:54.895 --> 12:58.237
LET ME POUR YOU A NICE
GLASS OF WINE HERE.

12:58.238 --> 13:00.109
OKAY, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

13:00.110 --> 13:01.991
HOLY CRAP! MY MOTHER'S HERE.

13:01.992 --> 13:03.452
NOPE. IF THAT WERE THE CASE,

13:03.453 --> 13:05.825
I'D BE POURING SOMETHING A
LOT STRONGER THAN WINE.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.206
OKAY, SO WHAT'S UP?

13:07.207 --> 13:08.577
WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY TO SEE ME?

13:08.578 --> 13:10.209
WELL, YES I AM HAPPY TO SEE YOU,

13:10.210 --> 13:12.041
BUT YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
IS HAPPY TO SEE YOU?

13:12.042 --> 13:13.462
WENDELL, COME HERE, BUDDY.

13:13.463 --> 13:14.713
COME HERE. LOOK WHO'S HERE.

13:14.714 --> 13:16.215
- MOMMY'S HOME.
- HEY, BABY.

13:16.216 --> 13:17.466
OH, YOU DO LOVE ME.

13:17.467 --> 13:18.797
OH, HE REALLY DOES LOVE ME.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.050
OF COURSE HE LOVES YOU.
WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE, HUH?

13:21.051 --> 13:23.052
HE KNOWS WHO HE BELONGS TO.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.423
HEY, WENDELL, COME HERE, BUDDY.
YOU'RE GOING TOO FAR.

13:24.424 --> 13:27.386
DOG TREATS?

13:27.387 --> 13:29.058
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO
BRIBE MY DOG TO LOVE ME

13:29.059 --> 13:31.100
WITH BACON?

13:31.101 --> 13:33.062
HEY, JOE, THERE'S
SOME GUY OUTSIDE.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.894
HE SAYS HE'S HERE FOR
A TRAINING SESSION.

13:34.895 --> 13:36.435
OKAY, THANKS.

13:36.436 --> 13:38.607
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GONNA
LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE

13:38.608 --> 13:41.030
FOR SOME QUALITY MOMMY,
WENDELL BONDING.

13:41.031 --> 13:44.033
AND YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
SHOULD BE ABLE TO

13:44.034 --> 13:45.704
LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER'S...

13:45.705 --> 13:47.786
OKAY, ARE YOU PUTTING
BACON IN MY POCKET?

13:47.787 --> 13:48.828
WHAT? NO.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.041
LOOK, YOU CAN'T JUST LINE
MY POCKETS WITH PORK

13:52.042 --> 13:53.042
TO GET THE DOG TO LOVE ME.

13:53.043 --> 13:55.254
IT WOULD HAVE WORKED.
I'M TELLING YOU.

13:55.255 --> 13:57.046
ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GO.

13:57.047 --> 13:58.627
I HAVE A CLIENT.

13:58.628 --> 14:00.299
YEAH, YOU'RE NOT
FOOLING ANYBODY.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.091
GO, RUN AND BE WITH
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.093
( barks )

14:04.674 --> 14:07.306
YOU KNOW, I TAKE A POOR
ORPHAN DOG INTO MY HOME

14:07.307 --> 14:09.058
AND THIS IS THE THANKS I GET?

14:09.059 --> 14:10.099
I SHOULD TAKE HIM TO THE POUND.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.891
YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO WENDELL.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.143
I MEANT JOE.

14:14.814 --> 14:16.185
BUT DIDN'T JOE DO A NICE THING

14:16.186 --> 14:17.856
BY TRYING TO TRICK THE
DOG INTO LOVING YOU?

14:17.857 --> 14:20.189
WELL, HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
TRICK WENDELL INTO LOVING ME.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.530
HE'S MY DOG.

14:21.531 --> 14:23.032
I'M THE ONE THAT
WANTED SOMETHING SMALL

14:23.033 --> 14:24.863
AND HELPLESS THAT I COULD HOLD
IN MY ARMS LIKE A LITTLE...

14:24.864 --> 14:26.865
- BABY?
- NO.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.948
SMALL DOG. WHERE'D
YOU GET "BABY"?

14:28.949 --> 14:30.539
( scoffs ) I'M NOT
READY FOR THAT.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.042
OH MY GOD, YOU SO WANT A BABY.

14:33.043 --> 14:35.044
WHAT?! NO.

14:35.045 --> 14:37.667
MAYBE.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.709
OKAY, WELL THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD

14:40.710 --> 14:42.962
GIVE JOE A CLUE ABOUT WHY
YOU REALLY GOT A DOG.

14:42.963 --> 14:44.463
ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:44.464 --> 14:45.965
THE LAST THING A GUY IN A NEW
RELATIONSHIP WANTS TO HEAR

14:45.966 --> 14:47.216
IS THE PHRASE "I WANT"

14:47.217 --> 14:49.218
FOLLOWED BY THE WORD "BABY."

14:49.219 --> 14:51.600
SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA
TRY TO BE HONEST WITH JOE?

14:51.601 --> 14:54.603
( chuckles ) OH, HONEY.

14:54.604 --> 14:57.016
OKAY, SO WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA BURY YOUR FEELINGS

14:57.017 --> 14:58.687
AND DRESS WENDELL UP
IN LITTLE OUTFITS?

14:58.688 --> 15:02.691
OH, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS
ADORABLE HOODIE I GOT HIM.

15:02.692 --> 15:04.193
OH, LOOK. IT'S SO CUTE.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.025
( imitates barking )

15:06.026 --> 15:07.737
( mouths words )

15:10.450 --> 15:12.531
HEY, JOE, CAN I BORROW
THE CAR KEYS TONIGHT?

15:12.532 --> 15:15.414
'CAUSE STELLA AND I ARE FINALLY
GETTING SOME ALONE TIME.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.296
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, I
THINK IT'S TIME YOU AND I

15:17.297 --> 15:19.038
HAVE A LITTLE MAN-TO-MAN CHAT.

15:19.039 --> 15:20.799
LOOK, FUN IS GREAT
AND EVERYTHING,

15:20.800 --> 15:22.131
BUT TONIGHT, YOU MAKE
SURE YOU TREAT HER WITH

15:22.132 --> 15:23.752
THE KINDNESS AND RESPECT
THAT SHE DESERVES.

15:23.753 --> 15:25.044
JOE, NO. I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND.

15:25.045 --> 15:26.385
I TOTALLY RESPECT WOMEN.

15:26.386 --> 15:28.547
STELLA WILL BE TOTALLY FINE.

15:28.548 --> 15:30.889
NO, I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY CAR.

15:30.890 --> 15:32.891
JUST GOT HER DETAILED.

15:32.892 --> 15:34.053
ALL RIGHT.

15:34.054 --> 15:36.265
HEY, YOU RESPECT STELLA TOO.

15:36.266 --> 15:39.018
SEE YOU, AUNT MEL.
I'M OFF FOR MY DATE.

15:39.019 --> 15:41.190
OH, BE SAFE, AND NO "T.N.D."

15:41.191 --> 15:43.112
TEXTING AND DRIVING, "T.N.D."

15:43.113 --> 15:45.734
RIGHT, YEAH. NO ONE
CALLS IT THAT.

15:45.735 --> 15:46.736
THE COOL KIDS DO.

15:48.868 --> 15:51.280
HEY, JOE, ABOUT WENDELL,

15:51.281 --> 15:53.032
LOOK, I WAS WRONG TO
IGNORE YOUR FEELINGS

15:53.033 --> 15:54.413
AND ADOPT HIM.

15:54.414 --> 15:56.625
AND LENNOX AND I WERE
TALKING EARLIER ABOUT HIM,

15:56.626 --> 15:58.377
AND I REALIZED THERE'S
SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU.

15:58.378 --> 15:59.878
WHAT?

15:59.879 --> 16:01.880
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT...

16:01.881 --> 16:06.295
I WANT TO... WELL, NOT
NOW, BUT SOMEDAY...

16:06.296 --> 16:10.089
HAVE THE DOG MICRO-CHIPPED.

16:10.090 --> 16:11.890
OKAY.

16:11.891 --> 16:13.433
WHAT DO YOU SAY, WENDELL?

16:15.225 --> 16:17.056
OH, LOOK. HE CAME TOME.

16:17.057 --> 16:20.399
AND THERE'S NO BACON ANYWHERE.
IS THERE?

16:20.400 --> 16:21.600
NO NO.

16:21.601 --> 16:24.023
HE IS LOVING YOU ALL ON HIS OWN.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.864
I GOTTA TELL YOU
SOMETHING TOO, MEL.

16:25.865 --> 16:28.107
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE OPEN-MINDED TO YOUR

16:28.108 --> 16:30.029
NOT SO TERRIBLE IDEA
OF US GETTING A DOG.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.281
'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
HE'S A GOOD DOG.

16:32.282 --> 16:37.616
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GONNA SAY THIS,

16:37.617 --> 16:40.709
BUT I LIKE OUR DOG.

16:40.710 --> 16:42.621
OH, AND I LIKE THE
SOUND OF THAT.

16:42.622 --> 16:44.043
"OUR" DOG.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.834
WENDELL'S NOT OUR DOG.

16:45.835 --> 16:46.925
WAIT, WHAT?

16:46.926 --> 16:48.627
YOU KNOW HOW I POSTED
THOSE PICTURE OF HIM

16:48.628 --> 16:50.799
UNDER "♪CUTEST DOG IN TOLEDO"?

16:50.800 --> 16:52.631
WELL, HE'S GOT 9,000 FOLLOWERS,

16:52.632 --> 16:54.473
BUT ONE OF THEM TURNS OUT
TO BE HIS ACTUAL OWNER.

16:54.474 --> 16:55.974
- HE'S LYING.
- NO, LOOK.

16:55.975 --> 16:57.556
HE SENT PICTURES AS PROOF.

16:57.557 --> 16:59.558
THAT DOG LOOKS NOTHING
LIKE WENDELL.

16:59.559 --> 17:01.270
PUT WENDELL IN A "BITCHES
BE CRAZY" SHIRT,

17:01.271 --> 17:02.481
AND IT'S HIM.

17:02.482 --> 17:04.193
WENDELL IS SO MUCH
CUTER THAN THAT DOG.

17:04.194 --> 17:05.694
YEAH, AND THIS DOG'S
NAME IS PAXTON.

17:05.695 --> 17:06.735
WHO NAMES THEIR DOG PAXTON?

17:06.736 --> 17:08.738
- HERE, PAXTON.
- ( barks )

17:10.150 --> 17:12.201
OH, COME ON NOW, IT
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

17:12.202 --> 17:13.362
I MEAN, YOU CALL
A DOG LIKE THAT,

17:13.363 --> 17:14.533
HE'S GONNA RESPOND.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.285
JUST LIKE IF YOU SAID
"HERE, BISCUIT,"

17:16.286 --> 17:17.956
OR "HERE, PRINCESS."

17:17.957 --> 17:20.369
SEE? SAME REACTION
AS "HERE, PAXTON."

17:20.370 --> 17:21.710
( barks )

17:21.711 --> 17:23.163
HE'S NOT OUR DOG, MEL.

17:24.584 --> 17:26.586
( jazz music playing )

17:27.877 --> 17:29.968
WELL, I HAD A GREAT TIME TODAY,

17:29.969 --> 17:32.431
SO THANKS AGAIN FOR MAKING ME
GO ON THE MARCHING BAND TRIP.

17:32.432 --> 17:34.223
NO, YOU DON'T NEED TO THANK ME.

17:34.224 --> 17:36.885
UNLESS YOU WANT TO. I MEAN,
I WOULDN'T STOP YOU.

17:36.886 --> 17:38.637
WHAT GUY DOESN'T
LIKE TO BE THANKED?

17:38.638 --> 17:41.440
OH MY GOD. THE BUS
RIDE HOME WAS CRAZY.

17:41.441 --> 17:43.852
IT TURNED INTO ONE
BIG WILD PARTY.

17:43.853 --> 17:46.024
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TIME.

17:46.025 --> 17:48.026
UGH, NO. I ENDED UP JUST
MOVING TO THE FRONT

17:48.027 --> 17:49.738
AND WORKING ON MY ENGLISH PAPER.

17:49.739 --> 17:52.281
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
RESPONSIBLE LIKE THAT,

17:52.282 --> 17:55.194
IT REALLY BRINGS OUT YOUR EYES.

17:55.195 --> 17:58.036
YEAH, I'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY
HARD TO GET MY G.P.A. UP

17:58.037 --> 18:00.869
SO I CAN GET A SCHOLARSHIP
TO A GOOD COLLEGE.

18:00.870 --> 18:03.122
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA DO IT.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.125
HEY, I RESPECT THAT.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.336
SO MUCH.

18:07.337 --> 18:09.208
YEAH, I MEAN, WHEN I
REALLY WANT SOMETHING,

18:09.209 --> 18:10.629
I JUST GO FOR IT.

18:10.630 --> 18:12.050
ME TOO.

18:12.051 --> 18:14.803
AND I KNOW I MADE A REALLY
BIG MISTAKE LAST YEAR.

18:14.804 --> 18:16.135
THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS IT,

18:16.136 --> 18:17.976
BUT I'M NOT GETTING
ANYWHERE NEAR MAKING

18:17.977 --> 18:19.218
THAT SORT OF MISTAKE AGAIN.

18:19.219 --> 18:20.309
HUH.

18:20.310 --> 18:22.771
I MEAN, NOW IS JUST NOT
THE TIME IN MY LIFE

18:22.772 --> 18:26.355
FOR ANYMORE SEX.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.106
YOU KNOW, THAT IS...
THAT'S NOT A DECISION

18:28.107 --> 18:30.108
YOU NEED TO MAKE
RIGHT NOW, STELLA.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.282
BUT WITH ISABEL'S FATHER,
IT WAS JUST SEX SEX SEX

18:33.283 --> 18:36.034
ALL THE TIME. IT NEVER STOPPED.

18:36.035 --> 18:37.867
SOUNDS LIKE HELL.

18:40.039 --> 18:43.242
BUT YOU HELPED ME REALIZE THAT THERE'S
MORE TO THAT IN A RELATIONSHIP.

18:43.243 --> 18:46.875
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
COMPATIBILITY AND KINDNESS.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.878
JUST HANGING OUT AND GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.049
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

18:51.050 --> 18:55.053
YEAH. I DO.

18:55.054 --> 18:56.216
I REALLY DO.

18:58.057 --> 19:00.559
SITTING HERE WITH YOU
LOOKING UP AT THE STARS,

19:00.560 --> 19:02.811
IT'S PRETTY GREAT.

19:02.812 --> 19:05.354
- CAN I ASK YOU ONE THING?
- YEAH.

19:05.355 --> 19:07.356
CAN YOU PUT YOUR ARM
AROUND ME AGAIN?

19:07.357 --> 19:08.767
YEAH, I CAN DO THAT.

19:08.768 --> 19:10.069
( chuckles )

19:16.155 --> 19:18.657
WENDELL... PAXTON,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.699
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WHILE THIS
HAS BEEN YOUR HOME FOR AWHILE,

19:20.700 --> 19:22.451
THE PLACE YOU'RE GOING
NOW IS YOUR REAL HOME.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.122
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:24.123 --> 19:26.044
WHERE THEY WERE IRRESPONSIBLE
AND DIDN'T KEEP TRACK OF YOU.

19:26.045 --> 19:29.087
- JOE.
- WHAT? HE DESERVES TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

19:29.088 --> 19:30.459
HUH? DON'T YOU?

19:30.460 --> 19:31.960
DON'T YOU DESERVE IT?

19:31.961 --> 19:34.883
DON'T YOU DESERVE TO KNOW...

19:34.884 --> 19:37.296
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
JUST HAPPENED RIGHT NOW.

19:37.297 --> 19:40.178
WELL, REMEMBER, MOMMY AND
DADDY WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.060
MOMMY AND DADDY.

19:42.061 --> 19:45.063
WELL, YEAH, I GUESS...

19:45.064 --> 19:47.356
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE
WHEN YOU HAVE A DOG, RIGHT?

19:47.357 --> 19:50.269
WELL, I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
ABOUT IT BEFORE EVER,

19:50.270 --> 19:51.570
BUT I GUESS SO.

19:51.571 --> 19:53.442
MEL, I THINK THAT'S
PART OF THE REASON

19:53.443 --> 19:56.945
WHY I WAS SO RESISTANT TO US
GETTING A DOG IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.238
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF
LIKE US HAVING A BABY.

19:59.239 --> 20:03.081
( chuckles ) THAT'S
WHAT YOU THOUGHT?

20:03.082 --> 20:04.453
WELL, YEAH.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.875
RAISING TEENAGERS IS ONE THING,

20:06.876 --> 20:10.038
BUT STARTING FROM SCRATCH,
THAT'S INTIMIDATING.

20:10.039 --> 20:11.880
REALLY?

20:11.881 --> 20:13.041
YOU INTIMIDATED?

20:13.042 --> 20:14.593
I BET YOU'D MAKE A GREAT DAD.

20:14.594 --> 20:17.175
WELL, THAT'S A SAFE BET.

20:17.176 --> 20:19.679
YEP, AND SOMEDAY, MAYBE
WE'LL HAVE ONE OF OUR OWN.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.051
- A DOG.
- OF COURSE A DOG.

20:23.052 --> 20:25.894
ABSOLUTELY. DOG.

20:25.895 --> 20:28.057
A TINY LITTLE BABY DOG.

20:33.903 --> 20:35.774
I DON'T GET IT. WHY
DOES HE LIKE YOU MORE?

20:35.775 --> 20:37.316
DOGS ARE PACK ANIMALS.

20:37.317 --> 20:39.318
AND THEY JUST NATURALLY
GRAVITATE TOWARD THE ALPHA.

20:39.319 --> 20:41.320
- YOU CAN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
- OH, YOU'RE THE ALPHA?

20:41.321 --> 20:42.991
IN MY HOUSE?

20:42.992 --> 20:44.573
I'M THE ALPHA
WHEREVER I GO, BABY.

20:44.574 --> 20:46.955
- ( scoffs )
- ( doorbell rings )

20:46.956 --> 20:49.247
DOGS JUST RESPOND TO
STRENGTH, YOU KNOW?

20:49.248 --> 20:50.670
WHY ELSE WOULD HE
LIKE ME SO MUCH?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.582
HI, I'M VIC SPINELLI.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.874
I'M HERE FOR MY DOG, PAXTON.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.506
HEY, I'M JOE LONGO.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.257
- HEY.
- HEY.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.509
WAIT, "LONGO FIT"?

21:00.510 --> 21:02.301
I SAW YOUR AD AT THE
HEALTH FOOD STORE.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.432
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH.

21:03.433 --> 21:04.803
I RUN "VIC'S CROSSFIT."

21:04.804 --> 21:05.884
I HEARD GOOD THINGS.

21:05.885 --> 21:07.386
LISTEN, THANKS FOR
TAKING CARE OF MY DOG.

21:07.387 --> 21:09.439
- ( barks )
- HEY, PAX, WAIT FOR ME.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.060
AMAZING.

21:12.061 --> 21:13.312
WHAT?

21:13.313 --> 21:14.893
SAME SHIRT, SAME BUILD.

21:14.894 --> 21:16.154
EVEN THE SAME COLOGNE.

21:16.155 --> 21:18.697
VIC IS YOU. YOU'RE VIC.

21:18.698 --> 21:20.819
THAT'S WHY THE DOG
LIKED YOU MORE.

21:20.820 --> 21:21.901
THAT SKINNY GUY?

21:23.242 --> 21:24.903
HEY, JUST REMEMBER SOMETHING.

21:24.904 --> 21:26.365
YOUR ALPHA'S RIGHT
OVER HERE, BABY.

21:26.366 --> 21:27.996
OH, YEAH? WELL,
YOU'RE ONLY THE ALPHA

21:27.997 --> 21:29.328
IN ONE ROOM IN THIS HOUSE.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.370
THE KITCHEN.
