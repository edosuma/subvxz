00:04.671 --> 00:07.439
Male voice:
<i>Hunger, a poet once said,</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:10.943
<i>is the most</i>
<i>important thing we know,</i>

00:10.945 --> 00:12.945
<i>the first lesson we learn. </i>

00:12.947 --> 00:19.985
<i>But hunger can be easily</i>
<i>quieted down, easily satiated.</i>

00:19.987 --> 00:23.889
<i>There is another force,</i>
<i>a different type of hunger,</i>

00:23.891 --> 00:28.227
<i>an unquenchable thirst that</i>
<i>cannot be extinguished.</i>

00:28.229 --> 00:31.630
<i>Its very existence</i>
<i>is what defines us,</i>

00:31.632 --> 00:34.733
<i>what makes us human.</i>

00:34.735 --> 00:37.403
<i>That force is love.</i>

00:39.973 --> 00:43.242
Pilot:
<i>Folks, this is your captain up</i>
<i>in the flight deck.</i>

00:43.244 --> 00:46.478
We are on our final descent into
New York for an on-time arrival.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.714
We want to thank you for
flying Regis Air

00:48.716 --> 00:50.382
and encourage that you ask us

00:50.384 --> 00:52.551
<i>any connecting gate</i>
<i>information you may need.</i>

00:52.553 --> 00:54.420
<i>We're looking at</i>
<i>partly cloudy skies</i>

00:54.422 --> 00:57.056
<i>and may hit a little</i>
<i>turbulence on our approach.</i>

00:57.058 --> 00:58.057
(phone rings)

00:58.059 --> 01:02.494
Not again.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.829
Yes?

01:03.831 --> 01:05.497
Male voice:
<i>Rose, get back here now.</i>

01:05.499 --> 01:06.832
<i>I need your help.</i>

01:06.834 --> 01:08.767
We're landing,
whatever it is can wait.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.270
<i>Now. Come now!</i>

01:11.272 --> 01:14.006
All right, relax.

01:18.344 --> 01:19.611
Sir, we're landing.

01:19.613 --> 01:22.014
Would you power off
your device?

01:22.016 --> 01:23.348
You call this a device?

01:23.350 --> 01:24.850
You have to
turn it off.

01:24.852 --> 01:28.854
It's like when a cop
calls a car a "vehicle".

01:28.856 --> 01:32.858
Or when he calls you sir when
he means "asshole".

01:32.860 --> 01:35.060
Having a little gig in
New York coming up.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.696
You give me three or four of
those little baby vodkas

01:37.698 --> 01:39.131
I'll get you a front-row seat.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.200
Turn it off,
put your seat up.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.768
We're landing, sir.

01:46.739 --> 01:49.475
Ma'am.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.243
Seat backs in the
upright position.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.811
Finally.

01:52.813 --> 01:55.080
Pilot:
<i>Flight attendants,</i>
<i>prepare for landing.</i>

01:55.082 --> 01:56.882
<i>(girl speaking French)</i>

02:11.631 --> 02:13.966
Pilot:
<i>On behalf of the cabin crew,</i>

02:13.968 --> 02:16.268
<i>I want to take a moment</i>
<i>to say--</i>

02:16.270 --> 02:18.437
Peter, you haven't done
anything back here!

02:18.439 --> 02:20.139
This place is a mess!

02:20.141 --> 02:22.407
- There's something
in the plane.
- What do you mean?

02:22.409 --> 02:24.676
- Something alive
in the cargo hold!
- Shh-shh!

02:26.146 --> 02:28.313
Pilot:
<i>We'd like to extend a</i>
<i>special thank you</i>

02:28.315 --> 02:31.150
<i>to any Black Platinum Award</i>
<i>Members flying with us tonight</i>

02:31.152 --> 02:33.018
<i>and encourage all our</i>
<i>passengers--</i>

02:33.020 --> 02:34.853
What the hell do
you mean, like a dog?

02:34.855 --> 02:36.922
No, it's something
really, really big.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.090
I heard it move.

02:38.092 --> 02:40.092
A thumping underneath
the floor.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.493
I heard it--

02:41.495 --> 02:43.695
No, Peter, there are
no animals on the manifest.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.264
It tried to open
the latch.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.932
I heard a noise.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.467
Then it moved away.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.870
But you can
feel it moving.

02:51.872 --> 02:55.774
Pilot:
<i>Flight crew,</i>
<i>prepare for arrival.</i>

03:30.043 --> 03:31.310
Did you see it?

03:31.312 --> 03:33.245
Nothing. I just think
that you were--

03:33.247 --> 03:34.413
(loud banging)

03:34.415 --> 03:36.248
Oh my God!

03:36.250 --> 03:37.916
Go tell Captain Redfern!

03:37.918 --> 03:39.751
Tell him to warn
the landing crew!

03:39.753 --> 03:41.153
And get emergency services!

03:41.155 --> 03:43.088
There's someone
down there!

03:43.090 --> 03:44.690
(loud roaring)

03:44.692 --> 03:46.525
It's gonna give!

03:46.527 --> 03:48.927
(loud rattling)

03:52.198 --> 03:54.233
(Rose and Peter screaming)

03:57.337 --> 04:01.006
Male voice:
<i>Private Delta 3-4-7, you're</i>
<i>clear for taxiway Foxtrot.</i>

04:01.008 --> 04:05.277
Private Delta 3-4-7,
clear for taxiway Foxtrot.

04:08.081 --> 04:12.618
Regis Air 7-5-3,
this is Kennedy ground.

04:14.887 --> 04:17.022
Regis Air 7-5-3, Kennedy ground.

04:18.358 --> 04:22.060
Regis 7-5-3,
Kennedy ground, over.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.595
(beeping)

04:23.597 --> 04:25.864
What the...?

04:27.533 --> 04:28.734
Bishop...

04:28.736 --> 04:30.602
a Regis Air flight
out of Berlin,

04:30.604 --> 04:31.937
the 767 widebody,

04:31.939 --> 04:33.739
stopped on the
service apron.

04:33.741 --> 04:34.873
What's it doing there?

04:34.875 --> 04:35.941
Apron's dead.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.042
That's a blind spot.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.110
I don't know.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.278
The plane just
went dark,

04:39.280 --> 04:40.646
shut down,
flat-out quit.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.247
No lights, no radio,
no nothing.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.082
Regis 7-5-3,
Kennedy ground, over.

04:44.084 --> 04:47.819
Regis 7-5-3- Kennedy ground,
please respond, over.

04:49.255 --> 04:50.789
Okay, shut down Foxtrot.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.992
Clear all the gates
and advise reroute.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.127
How many aboard?

04:55.129 --> 04:56.795
Almost full
flight, sir.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.231
Passengers, crew,
about 210 souls.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.666
Holy Jesus.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.568
Shouldn't we wait for
first responders, sir?

05:08.074 --> 05:10.309
<i>(banging)</i>

05:15.014 --> 05:18.617
Bishop?

05:18.619 --> 05:21.286
Bishop, wait!

05:21.288 --> 05:23.422
Engines are shut down.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.891
No lights.

05:30.797 --> 05:34.800
Whoa, it's cold.

05:34.802 --> 05:38.370
It's like a dead animal.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.474
There's something
really wrong here.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.509
<i>(distant sirens approaching)</i>

05:44.511 --> 05:46.678
It's like it
never moved.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.213
This looks so
much bigger

05:48.215 --> 05:50.048
from the ground
than on the screen.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.618
I mean, they're like
buildings with wings.

05:54.787 --> 05:57.689
All the window shades
are shut, see that?

05:58.725 --> 05:59.725
<i>Bishop!</i>

05:59.727 --> 06:01.360
Hey, fellas.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.628
Bishop...

06:03.630 --> 06:05.764
Not all of them...

06:14.340 --> 06:18.677
Scramble all emergency vehicles
to taxiway Foxtrot.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.312
SWAT, Homeland Security?

06:20.314 --> 06:22.647
Port Authority,
FBI, TSA, CDC.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.083
Robbie, no one on
the tower calls home.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.585
No one shares the news.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.154
This is bad,
real bad.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.792
<i>We've got ourselves</i>
<i>a dead airplane.</i>

06:55.114 --> 06:57.816
<i>(car horns)</i>

07:12.432 --> 07:15.534
Hey, buddy, you
can't park there.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.768
There's a fire
hydrant.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.403
It's a medical
emergency.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.805
Oh, is it really?

07:19.807 --> 07:21.873
It will be if I can't
get this tie on right.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.575
You know how to
tie this?

07:23.577 --> 07:25.644
I don't know, man,
I wear a clip-on.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.711
You're on your own.

07:26.713 --> 07:27.879
You waiting for
somebody?

07:27.881 --> 07:28.980
Yeah, why?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.482
Here's what I need
you to do.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.983
The meter maid comes by,

07:31.985 --> 07:33.718
you tell them it's official
CDC business, okay?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.787
Yeah, sure thing.

07:36.989 --> 07:39.491
Zach.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.793
Hey, man.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.233
Hey, dude.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.434
You're late.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.002
Five minutes.
It can't be helped.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.070
Ten, Dad.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.405
Ten? Okay.

07:53.407 --> 07:54.339
That's wrong.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.509
Maybe... maybe ten.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.177
I got a good feeling
about this.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.079
Wish us luck.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.749
Good luck.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.490
Five minutes.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.158
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.192
Ten.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.661
I texted you
five times.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.029
I wouldn't have
gotten that

08:18.031 --> 08:19.598
'cause I don't text
when I drive.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.699
It's not safe.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.933
Dr. Goodweather--

08:21.935 --> 08:23.134
Eph, please.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.503
She gets Kelly,
my son gets Zach,

08:24.505 --> 08:26.638
so Ephraim
or Eph, please.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.508
Dr. Goodweather,
this is the last of six

08:29.510 --> 08:31.643
court-appointed custody
counseling sessions.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.512
You've been late for
four of them.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.348
Are you gonna say that I'm late
because I don't want to be here?

08:36.350 --> 08:39.317
You might be onto something but
I have a really good reason.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.119
There was this outbreak
of Hantavirus

08:41.121 --> 08:42.821
in this alphabet city
pre-school.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.123
Which is extremely rare this far
north and east.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.025
Dr. Goodweather,
every time you come in

08:47.027 --> 08:48.527
you take over
the session.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.695
Because I have
control issues, I know.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.464
But I have to defend
myself here.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.966
Because this might
be my last chance.

08:54.968 --> 08:58.303
And I've thought long and hard
about this.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.239
And it seems like you two have
created this narrative

09:01.241 --> 09:03.041
wherein I'm the bad guy.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.309
But why?

09:04.311 --> 09:08.146
Because I don't want
out of my marriage.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.982
'Cause I want things back
the way they were.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.852
But this isn't just
about you, Eph,

09:13.854 --> 09:17.255
what you want,
not anymore.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.325
<i>(cell phone vibrates)</i>

09:27.199 --> 09:29.701
I'm an epidemiologist.

09:29.703 --> 09:33.738
You know, if I take time off, if
I go fly-fishing, people die.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.441
I get that you have
an important job, Ephraim.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.376
And you're great
at your job.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.211
You get straight 'A's
at your job.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.614
But I'm flunking
our marriage, is that it?

09:42.616 --> 09:45.417
What are you writing?
Please stop writing.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.854
How horrible am I?

09:49.856 --> 09:52.390
You're not horrible.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.593
You're just
barely present.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.530
I've done everything
you've asked me to

09:58.532 --> 10:01.433
in order to get us
back together again.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.068
I quit drinking.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.070
You wanted time alone
so I moved out,

10:05.072 --> 10:06.137
against my own wishes.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.772
I've jumped through
every hoop.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.207
Tell me what you need.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.409
Our time apart has only
clarified things for me.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.878
It's allowed me to make
room in my life for Matt.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.114
We're going to be
living together now and--

10:16.116 --> 10:19.417
Matt, the Sears guy you were
talking about, at my house?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.086
Matt is an operational
manager.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.153
At Sears.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.622
Yeah, and you
know what,

10:23.624 --> 10:25.323
he gets straight 'A's
at his job, too.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.891
But at home,
he's present.

10:26.893 --> 10:30.562
Unlike you, he's always
here for both of us.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.499
Does he drive
a green Prius?

10:34.501 --> 10:38.069
<i>(cell phone vibrates)</i>

10:41.807 --> 10:44.409
You want me to quit
my job, I'll do it.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.477
I'll quit my job.

10:45.479 --> 10:46.945
I don't want you
to quit for me.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.413
I wouldn't be
quitting for you.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.348
I'd be quitting because
of you for Zach,

around Queens

Dr. Goodweather.

I love you but...

10:57.858 --> 11:00.692
How can you love me

11:49.075 --> 11:50.975
Nora, how bad is it?

11:50.977 --> 11:52.377
Nora:
<i>It's crazy.</i>

11:52.379 --> 11:54.579
I have like 12 different
agency officials

11:54.581 --> 11:56.715
about to have a
dick-measuring contest here.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.416
Eph:
<i>No. </i>

11:58.418 --> 12:00.719
It's an international flight
docking out of Berlin.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.020
<i>CDC gets the first call.</i>

12:02.022 --> 12:03.755
I can be there in 20 minutes.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.191
Can you keep the measuring
contest going that long?

12:06.193 --> 12:08.259
Don't worry,
I'll show them mine.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.729
It might just work.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.899
Male voice:
<i>Sorry.</i>

12:14.901 --> 12:18.737
I guess the meter reader didn't
see it as much of an emergency.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.173
Matt, huh?

12:22.175 --> 12:24.109
Yeah, that's me.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.610
Interesting.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.012
You know, it's too bad
I'm in such a rush, Matt.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.415
But I'm sure I'll see you
again in my house.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.122
<i>You drive safe now,</i>
<i>you hear?</i>

12:45.197 --> 12:46.264
Hey, boss.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.432
Got my milk?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.733
Uh, yeah, here.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.702
Homeland Security
is just desperate

12:50.704 --> 12:52.637
to push the button on
a terror alert.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.973
They're ready to get on that
plane right now.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.775
Jim, terrorists
usually crash planes,

12:56.777 --> 12:58.243
not land them and
shut them down.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.944
What are the
911 calls saying?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.146
There haven't
been any.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.213
None?

13:02.215 --> 13:03.248
Uh uh.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.415
Dr. Goodweather!

13:04.417 --> 13:05.884
When we flew to Chicago
last week

13:05.886 --> 13:07.719
we sat on the tarmac
for half an hour.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.788
People were freaking out,
texting, calling.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.490
There've been 200 people
sitting there silently for--

13:12.492 --> 13:14.125
Over an hour now.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.126
Pilots?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.261
Absolutely
no movement.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.662
Have you done
heat readings?

13:17.664 --> 13:19.330
<i>Surface of the</i>
<i>plane is too cold.</i>

13:19.332 --> 13:20.832
Blocks it all
like a screen.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.133
We got Delsar mics
attached

13:22.135 --> 13:23.568
to the surface
of the plane,

13:23.570 --> 13:24.836
picked up
mostly silence.

13:24.838 --> 13:25.837
Mostly?

13:25.839 --> 13:27.138
<i>Well, cooling pings</i>

13:27.140 --> 13:28.606
<i>from the sheet metal</i>
<i>contracting.</i>

13:28.608 --> 13:30.842
Oh, and
there's this.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.920
<i>(static, rustling noise)</i>

13:41.922 --> 13:43.288
What do you think
that is?

13:43.290 --> 13:44.823
Rustling of some sort.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.991
Our experts think
it's the engine shutting down

13:46.993 --> 13:48.259
or liquids settling.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.994
How long between
landing and shutdown?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.496
Six minutes.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.464
It's too short a window
for a contagious event.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.301
So I think CDC should take
a back seat on this one.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.602
I agree.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.703
Do you?

13:58.705 --> 13:59.871
Absolutely, I do.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.639
How often do you
touch your face?

14:01.641 --> 14:02.774
What?

14:02.776 --> 14:03.875
In a day, how often?

14:03.877 --> 14:05.877
I don't know,
once an hour?

14:05.879 --> 14:07.545
<i>Every three minutes.</i>

14:07.547 --> 14:09.681
<i>You have mouth/hand contact</i>
<i>every five minutes.</i>

14:09.683 --> 14:11.783
<i>You touch somebody else</i>
<i>every 20 minutes.</i>

14:11.785 --> 14:13.318
That's how contagion works.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.552
You don't like
terrorists?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.120
Try negotiating
with a virus.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.691
A virus exists only to find
a carrier and reproduce.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.160
That's all it does
and it does it quickly.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.728
It has no political views,

14:23.730 --> 14:26.397
it has no religious beliefs,
it has no cultural hang-ups.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.733
And it has no respect
for a badge.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.369
It has no concept
of time or geography.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.338
It might as well be
the Middle Ages,

14:33.340 --> 14:35.540
except for the convenience
of hitching a ride

14:35.542 --> 14:38.910
on a metal tube flying
from meal to meal to meal.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.713
That's how a plague begins.

14:43.182 --> 14:46.117
So you still want to be the
first one through the door?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.091
<i>(sirens, woman yelling)</i>

15:10.242 --> 15:11.776
(rings bell)

15:11.778 --> 15:14.178
So we heard you buy silver
without a receipt, man.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.446
Is that right?

15:15.448 --> 15:16.781
(rings bell again)

15:16.783 --> 15:18.483
(chuckles)

15:20.286 --> 15:24.122
I'm always in need of
good silver, yes.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.790
<i>Okay, well...</i>

15:25.792 --> 15:31.329
Can I get, uh,
50 for this?

15:33.065 --> 15:38.136
It's a very nice
timepiece, indeed.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.872
I see that the band
links have snapped.

15:40.874 --> 15:44.575
You must have been
in a hurry taking it off.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.945
Can I... can I get
50 for it?

15:46.947 --> 15:50.381
I can offer you
maybe 25...

15:50.383 --> 15:53.985
if the test is good.

15:57.122 --> 16:00.792
<i>Unfortunately, this is merely</i>
<i>silver-plated brass.</i>

16:00.794 --> 16:04.996
A cheap Eastern European
knock-off.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.165
Agh!

16:07.167 --> 16:08.433
Listen very
carefully, son!

16:08.435 --> 16:10.134
I know your little friend
has a gun

16:10.136 --> 16:12.337
and the hammer is cocked
but I don't care.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.740
I can control your entire body
weight from this pressure point

16:15.742 --> 16:18.943
and this knife is pointing
straight at your radial artery.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.979
By the time he clears
his coat pocket,

16:20.981 --> 16:23.915
your artery will be punctured
and sliced wide open

16:23.917 --> 16:24.916
from top to bottom.

16:24.918 --> 16:26.284
(whimpering)

16:26.286 --> 16:28.286
You fall down bleeding,
I go under the counter

16:28.288 --> 16:30.755
and your friend starts
shooting at an empty space.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.457
I can guarantee you this--

16:32.459 --> 16:35.126
you will bleed out before the
911 operator answers the phone.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.861
That is option one!

16:36.863 --> 16:39.430
Option two is, you release
the bills,

16:39.432 --> 16:41.466
your friend gives me the gun,

16:41.468 --> 16:43.601
he can keep the bullets,
I don't care,

16:43.603 --> 16:45.203
and you leave this store.

16:45.205 --> 16:49.774
Now, son, you have a choice.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.176
(grunts)

17:01.653 --> 17:05.723
(whimpers)

17:05.725 --> 17:09.727
Is there anything else I can do
for you gentlemen this evening?

17:22.474 --> 17:25.076
News anchor:
<i>We have more now on</i>
<i>the developing story</i>

17:25.078 --> 17:27.145
<i>out of JFK Airport</i>

17:27.147 --> 17:28.913
<i>You're looking at live video</i>

17:28.915 --> 17:32.216
<i>of the airplane identified as</i>
<i>a Regis Air widebody jet.</i>

17:32.218 --> 17:33.918
<i>It originated in Berlin</i>

17:33.920 --> 17:36.154
<i>and it shut down just</i>
<i>moments after landing.</i>

17:36.156 --> 17:39.090
<i>We are told there has been no</i>

<i>All attempts to contact</i>

18:06.685 --> 18:09.420
<i>("Maggie" folk song playing</i>
<i>on radio)</i>

19:01.473 --> 19:04.142
He's back.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.749
I, uh...

19:11.751 --> 19:14.152
I don't know if I have
the strength

19:14.154 --> 19:16.554
to do it all over again.

19:23.595 --> 19:26.297
This time...

19:26.299 --> 19:29.066
I cannot fail.

19:36.542 --> 19:39.277
Feeling hungry?

20:08.874 --> 20:11.742
(squishing sounds)

20:15.714 --> 20:18.616
Enjoy, dear.

20:36.702 --> 20:39.237
(sirens)

20:43.709 --> 20:48.112
I'm not looking forward to what
we'll see out there.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.682
You with me?

20:51.684 --> 20:54.518
Mysterious dead plane on the
tarmac not exciting enough?

20:54.520 --> 20:58.189
Sorry, just another
court-mandated,

20:58.191 --> 21:02.126
happy family therapy day.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.395
I noticed, you
cut your hair.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.063
You cleaned up nicely.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.398
Did you break
out a tie?

21:07.400 --> 21:10.635
It's in my
jacket pocket.

21:10.637 --> 21:11.736
Did it help?

21:11.738 --> 21:13.571
Uh, no, in fact,
it didn't.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.240
She wants to take
Zack away from me.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.409
And there's a...
man-child

21:18.411 --> 21:20.911
living in my house
with my son.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.813
Careful.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.051
Stay focused.

21:30.389 --> 21:33.090
You and Kelly have been
separated for a year,

21:33.092 --> 21:34.325
and things happen.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.493
It happened to us.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.827
Oh, that's different.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.928
How is it different?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.063
It just is.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.331
I don't think Kelly
would agree.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.500
She doesn't know.
I never told her.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.567
You didn't?

21:43.569 --> 21:44.935
No, she...

21:44.937 --> 21:46.804
she filed so
I didn't tell her.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.372
She doesn't know.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.876
You really know nothing about
women, do you?

21:54.479 --> 21:57.048
¶

22:01.853 --> 22:04.822
<i>(urgent chatter)</i>

22:07.025 --> 22:09.927
Okay, boss...

22:09.929 --> 22:11.762
ready to go through the
looking glass?

22:11.764 --> 22:14.665
Eph:
<i>Ready, Jim.</i>

22:14.667 --> 22:16.967
I got your milk.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.837
Keep it cold 'til I come back.

22:53.739 --> 22:56.741
Oh my God...

22:56.743 --> 22:58.909
Jim, do you see this?

22:58.911 --> 23:01.178
It's every passenger.
Everyone on the plane.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.713
Yeah.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.415
<i>We're seeing it.</i>

23:04.417 --> 23:06.350
Eph:
<i>They're all dead.</i>

23:06.352 --> 23:09.387
Jim:
<i>What is it, Eph?</i>
<i>What killed them?</i>

23:09.389 --> 23:10.921
No signs of struggle.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.658
No signs of blistering
or chemical agents.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.927
No bruising.

23:19.564 --> 23:22.900
Eph:
<i>Not seeing discoloration...</i>

23:22.902 --> 23:25.236
<i>no markings.</i>

23:25.238 --> 23:27.772
Shit, what is it?

23:30.008 --> 23:32.743
Something sudden, painless.

23:35.680 --> 23:40.584
All the window shades are closed
except for this one.

23:42.554 --> 23:44.622
Jim:
<i>Is it a gas leak?</i>
<i>Is it chemical?</i>

23:44.624 --> 23:47.425
Nora:
<i>The Hazmat Cat's picking up</i>
<i>high levels of ammonia.</i>

23:47.427 --> 23:49.026
Nothing deadly, though.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.295
There shouldn't be any ammonia
in the plane systems.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.897
Jim, check the cargo
manifest.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.031
Got it.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.566
I need a cargo manifest.

23:55.568 --> 23:56.767
What about the Geiger?

23:56.769 --> 23:59.136
It's negative, Jim.

24:18.757 --> 24:23.093
No visible signs of trauma.

24:23.095 --> 24:26.797
(music heard through ear buds)

24:26.799 --> 24:28.999
(shuts music off)

24:33.972 --> 24:36.006
No bloating.

24:37.776 --> 24:41.011
Tongue and soft palate
appear pale, almost white.

24:48.086 --> 24:51.088
Eyes are clear.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.124
The skin is dry, it's inelastic.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.861
There's no frothing,
no nosebleeds.

24:57.796 --> 24:59.530
There's no signs
of struggle.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.266
Almost peaceful.

25:05.670 --> 25:09.006
Let's try the
UV lights.

25:19.484 --> 25:22.853
My God,
what is this?

25:25.557 --> 25:28.459
Nora:
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

25:28.461 --> 25:31.061
Eph:
<i>These patterns are everywhere.</i>

25:31.063 --> 25:32.963
<i>All over the cabin.</i>

25:32.965 --> 25:35.399
They're only visible
under UV light.

25:35.401 --> 25:38.769
Nora:
<i>The pattern is biological.</i>

25:40.672 --> 25:43.607
Probably where the ammonia
is coming from.

25:44.743 --> 25:47.811
I'm taking samples.

25:47.813 --> 25:50.314
You take the front galley,
I'll take the rear.

26:41.566 --> 26:43.133
Jimbo...

26:43.135 --> 26:45.202
<i>what is this?</i>

26:46.738 --> 26:49.640
Jim:
No, "Jimbo, please"?

26:49.642 --> 26:52.876
Um, that's the cargo
compartment.

26:52.878 --> 26:54.211
Have it emptied.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.113
Take each piece of luggage

26:56.115 --> 26:58.816
and check it for biological
agents and ammonia spectrum.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.651
Jim:
<i>Got it.</i>

27:31.483 --> 27:32.616
Jim...

27:32.618 --> 27:35.719
<i>the cockpit door just opened.</i>

27:36.621 --> 27:38.355
Jim:
<i>It should be locked.</i>

27:38.357 --> 27:41.425
<i>Nora, that door's not supposed</i>
<i>to be open.</i>

27:41.427 --> 27:43.761
Just going to take
a quick look.

27:43.763 --> 27:46.764
Jim: <i>Alright, I want you to</i>
<i>back out of there right now,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

27:46.766 --> 27:48.999
That door is supposed
to be locked.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.869
<i>You shouldn't be in there</i>
<i>alone.</i>

27:52.837 --> 27:54.605
Nora, can you hear me?

27:54.607 --> 27:55.839
Eph!

27:55.841 --> 27:57.541
<i>The door to the cockpit</i>
<i>is open.</i>

27:57.543 --> 27:59.076
<i>Nora is inside.</i>

28:03.782 --> 28:07.718
<i>Nora? Eph?</i>

28:07.720 --> 28:11.021
<i>Come on, guys,</i>
<i>somebody talk to me!</i>

28:11.023 --> 28:13.724
(gasps)

28:13.726 --> 28:16.126
(panting)

28:16.128 --> 28:17.961
Nora, I'm coming!

28:19.130 --> 28:20.197
(gasping)

28:20.199 --> 28:21.398
Help me!

28:21.400 --> 28:23.967
Lady, get the light
outta my face.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.703
(coughing)

28:25.705 --> 28:27.304
Jim:
<i>I'm sending in SWAT!</i>

28:27.306 --> 28:28.806
No, Jim, send paramedics!

28:28.808 --> 28:31.075
We've got survivors!

29:05.443 --> 29:06.944
Mr. Palmer...

29:06.946 --> 29:09.513
Shh! It's his
dialysis session.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.248
He's asleep.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.450
Well, then
wake him up.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.885
When he's ready.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.120
Now.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.756
In time.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.891
Automated voice:
<i>Dialysis complete.</i>

29:20.893 --> 29:24.461
How long have you worked for
Stoneheart, Mr. Fitzwilliam?

29:24.463 --> 29:26.230
All my life, sir.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.932
Mr. Palmer aided me
and my brothers

29:28.934 --> 29:30.801
after my father passed.

29:30.803 --> 29:36.273
Gratitude, what
an effective leash.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.109
<i>Herr Eichhorst...</i>

29:42.647 --> 29:49.153
Mr. Palmer, Herr Eichhorst is
here to pay his respects.

29:51.756 --> 29:54.324
I'll be outside
if you need me.

29:56.261 --> 30:00.464
You may notice how chilly it
has gotten in here, Eichhorst.

30:00.466 --> 30:03.400
Twenty full degrees cooler
than the rest of the building.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.569
But not too cold
for you, I trust.

30:05.571 --> 30:10.808
Of course, it can't be
too cold for you, can it?

30:10.810 --> 30:13.410
The cargo has
arrived safely

30:13.412 --> 30:16.647
and all four survivors
have been found.

30:18.082 --> 30:19.817
Throughout my life

30:19.819 --> 30:23.253
I've learned what it
feels to cross a line,

30:23.255 --> 30:24.955
to do things.

30:24.957 --> 30:28.892
Things that cannot
be undone.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.597
That line--

30:33.599 --> 30:38.335
it has been crossed
now, hasn't it?

30:38.337 --> 30:40.170
Your breath--

30:40.172 --> 30:44.107
I'll never
get used to...

30:44.109 --> 30:48.111
Yes, even I miss breathing
sometimes.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.049
(urgent chatter)

30:52.051 --> 30:55.219
Here we go.

30:55.221 --> 30:58.322
(siren)

30:58.324 --> 31:01.959
Eph:
Leave it to me,
it won't be long.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.334
Everett.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.502
Eph.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.571
How bad is it?

31:18.376 --> 31:21.245
Jim:
The NTSB has taken over a
refrigerated chemical warehouse

31:21.247 --> 31:23.180
in the Bronx.

31:23.182 --> 31:26.683
They've turned it into a fully
contained mass casualty morgue.

31:26.685 --> 31:28.185
That's not
necessary, Everett.

31:28.187 --> 31:29.653
These bags are
triple-sealed.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.688
I'm handing a dozen
bodies over to the CME

31:31.690 --> 31:33.557
four from each section
of the plane

31:33.559 --> 31:34.658
for autopsies.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.226
And the four survivors?

31:36.228 --> 31:37.861
I've secured the isolation
rooms at a local hospital.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.496
We need to move them
there right away.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.198
Of course. I'm sure
they'll comply.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.866
Comply? I'm not
asking them.

31:42.868 --> 31:44.735
Invoking the Health Powers Act,
those four survivors stay.

31:44.737 --> 31:46.436
Quarantine?

31:46.438 --> 31:49.840
It's within the powers of the
CDC, Everett, you know that.

31:49.842 --> 31:51.174
Look, if you quarantine

31:51.176 --> 31:53.043
I need you to meet
with the next of kin.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.945
Reassure them the
CDC's on the case.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.413
Fine.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.282
<i>We're trying to figure</i>
<i>out what happened,</i>

31:58.284 --> 32:00.050
<i>what caused this.</i>

32:00.052 --> 32:02.286
- Isn't that what's
most important?
- Yes, of course.

32:02.288 --> 32:05.055
But it's also important we don't
have full-tilt panic.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.557
These people need to hear from
someone in the field.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.259
We don't know
anything yet.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.695
You two figure this out.
I don't have time for this shit.

32:11.697 --> 32:12.863
<i>- Jim?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

32:12.865 --> 32:14.197
When he talks
to the families,

32:14.199 --> 32:16.066
I want no press,
Everett.

32:16.068 --> 32:19.169
No press, I promise.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.818
Okay, you're telling
me only four people

32:34.820 --> 32:36.653
survived this plane crash?

32:36.655 --> 32:37.788
Ms. Luss--

32:37.790 --> 32:39.056
It's Mrs. Luss.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.824
Mrs. Luss, there was
no crash.

32:40.826 --> 32:42.259
An unidentified agent

32:42.261 --> 32:44.227
killed all of the
remaining passengers.

32:44.229 --> 32:46.897
Any information you can give
us would be of great help.

32:46.899 --> 32:48.231
Of great help to who?

32:48.233 --> 32:49.666
To us, ma'am, the CDC.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.635
Okay, well, I'm no
ordinary passenger.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.003
I'm Joan Luss.

32:53.005 --> 32:55.973
I'm an attorney... of
Matloff, Luss and Hayum.

32:55.975 --> 32:58.742
So all that information
that you're collecting

32:58.744 --> 33:00.577
you're going to need
to get to me.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.980
Personally--

33:02.982 --> 33:04.314
What are you doing?

33:04.316 --> 33:06.483
Don't seal me in,
I'm talking to you.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.119
<i>Excuse me, little miss.</i>
<i>Don't you walk away from me.</i>

33:09.121 --> 33:11.488
<i>I am Joan Luss.</i>

33:11.490 --> 33:14.157
Captain Redfern, this is my
colleague, Dr. Martinez.

33:14.159 --> 33:16.360
What happened
on my plane?

33:16.362 --> 33:18.862
That's what we came
to ask you.

33:18.864 --> 33:21.798
Now, I want you to try to
recall, as best you can--

33:21.800 --> 33:24.601
fresh cut grass, garlic,
green apple--

33:24.603 --> 33:26.837
do you remember smelling any
of these odors

33:26.839 --> 33:28.538
before you passed out?

33:28.540 --> 33:30.507
What? Grass? Apples?

33:30.509 --> 33:33.276
Mnemonic odors, the way our
brain reads chemicals.

33:33.278 --> 33:36.680
Phosphine gas, colorless,
smells like garlic.

33:36.682 --> 33:40.183
Or phosgene very toxic,
smells like freshly cut grass.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.952
I remember landing
the plane

33:41.954 --> 33:43.520
and turning onto
the taxiway.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.322
And then...

33:45.324 --> 33:47.891
I don't remember
anything else.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.893
Eph, can I get
you for a sec?

33:51.129 --> 33:52.462
Oh, thank God,
you're here.

33:52.464 --> 33:53.530
I was just
telling him

33:53.532 --> 33:54.965
I have this noise
in my head

33:54.967 --> 33:56.299
like a hum.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.301
Could you have someone
look at my ears again?

33:58.303 --> 34:00.871
We'll have somebody perform
a full battery of tests.

34:00.873 --> 34:03.807
But for now you need to stay
inside this tent, Mr. Barbour.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.142
You don't understand.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.144
My wife is gonna panic
if I don't call soon.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.245
I need to call home.

34:08.247 --> 34:10.814
Hey, you.

34:10.816 --> 34:13.583
You're the guy I gotta
talk to around here?

34:13.585 --> 34:15.152
Uh, yeah, I think so.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.887
How about some
Demerol, Doc, huh?

34:16.889 --> 34:19.923
And what time's that
refreshment cart swing by, uh?

34:19.925 --> 34:22.826
Mr. Bolivar, what is the
last thing that you remember

34:22.828 --> 34:24.528
before landing?

34:24.530 --> 34:25.862
I don't know, uh...

34:25.864 --> 34:28.165
flickering lights,
maybe.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.033
I black out sometimes.

34:30.035 --> 34:31.234
Those cuts on your arm?

34:31.236 --> 34:33.070
Oh, these?

34:33.072 --> 34:35.605
Yeah, I cut.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.607
For the fans.

34:37.609 --> 34:40.243
Tell me, these tattoos,
occult, satanic things

34:40.245 --> 34:43.447
is this really part of
your belief system?

34:45.116 --> 34:46.516
You're kidding, Doc?

34:46.518 --> 34:49.419
My father's a
Baptist minister.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.088
I'm in it for the pussy.

34:51.090 --> 34:52.756
<i>Eph.</i>

34:52.758 --> 34:54.925
There's something you have to
see in the cargo area,

34:54.927 --> 34:56.059
right now.

34:56.061 --> 34:58.095
Okay, let's go.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.104
Who un-crated this thing?

35:07.106 --> 35:08.238
No one.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.906
This was how
it came out.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.441
No straps,
no containment wrap.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.409
Well, what is it?

35:12.411 --> 35:14.077
What's inside
of it?

35:14.079 --> 35:15.312
No one's opened
it yet.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.114
But, what does it
say in the manifest?

35:17.116 --> 35:18.615
It's not on
the manifest.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.651
You got golf clubs,
kayaks, machine parts

35:21.653 --> 35:24.054
40 generators,
10,000 condoms

35:24.056 --> 35:27.290
10 plasma TVs,
but no box.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.493
Nora:
Looks like a coffin,
doesn't it?

35:29.495 --> 35:31.495
Coffin?
It's nine feet tall.

35:31.497 --> 35:35.065
It's old.

35:35.067 --> 35:37.968
It's hand carved,
it's not machined.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.972
Jim:
Hey, guys, over here.

35:53.017 --> 35:55.418
Guys, look, we swabbed it,
we ran the Geiger,

35:55.420 --> 35:57.821
we did samples of the air and
everything is fine.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.256
But the NTSB was
crystal clear

35:59.258 --> 36:01.491
they didn't want us
to touch anything.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.693
Help me open it.

36:03.695 --> 36:06.396
Okay.

36:09.534 --> 36:10.867
Nora:
Soil.

36:10.869 --> 36:14.437
Why would someone
ship a box of soil?

36:14.439 --> 36:17.174
What are the chances of someone
loading this

36:17.176 --> 36:19.009
unchecked and unlisted?

36:19.011 --> 36:21.678
Something this size in
a flight bound for the US?

36:21.680 --> 36:22.779
Impossible.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.381
Not in today's
world.

36:24.383 --> 36:27.384
Jim, get samples from
the top, mid, bottom

36:27.386 --> 36:28.718
plastic seal it.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.053
No one goes near this,

36:30.055 --> 36:32.589
not Customs, not Homeland
Security, nobody.

36:36.227 --> 36:38.328
Nora:
<i>Eph, look.</i>

36:38.330 --> 36:40.363
<i>It's a latch.</i>

36:40.365 --> 36:43.066
Why would anyone put a latch
on the inside?

36:45.903 --> 36:47.070
Call Berlin.

36:47.072 --> 36:48.872
There's gotta be
a record of this.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.373
Somebody put this
on the plane.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.475
We just have to
find out who.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.983
TV Reporter:
A lot of confusion here tonight

36:59.985 --> 37:02.886
at JFK International Airport,
Nestor.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.355
Officials with the Centers for
Disease Control--

37:05.357 --> 37:07.023
Any man who doesn't put
your mom first

37:07.025 --> 37:08.858
is out-of-his-mind crazy.
Right, Z?

37:08.860 --> 37:10.894
TV Reporter:
<i>...multiple casualties,</i>

37:10.896 --> 37:12.996
<i>I repeat, multiple casualties</i>

37:12.998 --> 37:15.832
<i>aboard the stalled airliner,</i>
<i>Regis Air flight 753.</i>

37:15.834 --> 37:18.168
Tonight was a
big step for you.

37:18.170 --> 37:19.536
Shh!

37:19.538 --> 37:21.605
TV Report:
<i>...what caused the fatalities.</i>

37:21.607 --> 37:23.106
<i>As you can see, behind me</i>

37:23.108 --> 37:25.508
<i>officials with the CDC</i>
<i>are on the scene.</i>

37:25.510 --> 37:28.912
<i>But whether this is any</i>
<i>indication of a biological</i>
<i>contamination--</i>

37:28.914 --> 37:30.380
Terrorists, it has to be.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.948
What do you
think, Z?

37:31.950 --> 37:34.718
Whatever it is,
my dad will handle it.

37:34.720 --> 37:35.852
Good night.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.554
Good night,
sweetheart.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.123
TV Reporter:
<i>...what caused the</i>
<i>fatalities...</i>

37:45.930 --> 37:48.531
And I need the master list
of passengers

37:48.533 --> 37:50.267
with their points of
embarkation.

37:50.269 --> 37:52.836
Also every place where
that plane landed.

38:10.454 --> 38:12.455
Eph...

38:12.457 --> 38:15.292
the families are
waiting.

38:19.630 --> 38:23.733
You know this is all about him
covering his own ass, right?

38:38.015 --> 38:41.418
Just talk to them like you'd
like to be talked to.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.320
Tell them what you'd
like to hear.

38:43.322 --> 38:47.090
Whatever happens
I'll be there.

38:57.034 --> 38:59.602
(speaking German)

39:12.983 --> 39:15.552
(faint roaring,
high-pitch buzzing)

39:24.829 --> 39:28.631
Hey, you hear that?

39:29.633 --> 39:32.635
No. Sorry, nothing.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.916
(faint male voices)

40:03.434 --> 40:06.069
(low rumbling, male voices)

40:43.040 --> 40:45.842
(low rumbling)

40:50.247 --> 40:52.982
What the...?

40:57.922 --> 41:00.523
(screeching roar)

41:02.126 --> 41:04.294
Agghh!

41:07.631 --> 41:10.900
(gurgling)

41:10.902 --> 41:13.503
(crying out in pain)

41:29.820 --> 41:32.255
(crushing blows)

41:35.159 --> 41:37.527
(indistinct muttering)

41:42.867 --> 41:45.502

41:56.847 --> 41:59.649
You got hands,
homeboy.

41:59.651 --> 42:02.185
Knocking boys out every day
when I was locked up.

42:02.187 --> 42:05.955
Raised all the time
like Mayweather.

42:07.491 --> 42:09.392
When I go pro

42:09.394 --> 42:11.861
and I get rich,
I'll let you wash my car.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.730
I'll let him be
my driver.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.131
Wooo!

42:15.133 --> 42:17.400
That was it, you gonna
sleep for a week.

42:17.402 --> 42:19.836
Greatest of all time, baby,
greatest of all time.

42:19.838 --> 42:22.005
You are avoiding
me, Gus.

42:22.007 --> 42:24.707
This guy...

42:24.709 --> 42:25.742
<i>Just like that?</i>

42:25.744 --> 42:29.078
Just appear out
of nowhere?

42:29.080 --> 42:31.080
Reminds me of
my ex, huh?

42:31.082 --> 42:32.482
(chuckles)

42:32.484 --> 42:34.684
Now I'm gonna tell you
like I told her,

42:34.686 --> 42:36.819
how you find
me, bitch?

42:41.025 --> 42:44.227
I'll catch up to you
in a little bit, man.

42:44.229 --> 42:46.596
We good.

42:47.598 --> 42:48.998
Wassup?

42:50.501 --> 42:51.901
As we agreed

42:51.903 --> 42:54.671
you will pick up the
vehicle at the airport.

42:54.673 --> 42:56.005
The airport?

42:56.007 --> 42:57.373
The whole place
is on lock.

42:57.375 --> 42:59.342
You don't watch
the news, white boy?

42:59.344 --> 43:01.878
You will enter through
a service staircase

43:01.880 --> 43:02.946
get the vehicle.

43:02.948 --> 43:04.881
When you get to
a barricade

43:04.883 --> 43:06.883
you will be
let through.

43:06.885 --> 43:10.086
It's all arranged.

43:11.922 --> 43:13.590
It's all arranged?

43:13.592 --> 43:16.025
Calm down, double oh seven.

43:16.027 --> 43:17.627
I never let you
down before.

43:17.629 --> 43:20.463
This is different.

43:22.733 --> 43:24.634
I need to make sure

43:24.636 --> 43:27.470
you follow my
instructions precisely.

43:27.472 --> 43:30.440
Your brother's
criminal record

43:30.442 --> 43:34.544
and your mother's
immigration status.

43:34.546 --> 43:36.412
If this is a threat

43:36.414 --> 43:39.048
you just made
a mistake, puto.

43:39.050 --> 43:44.287
It is not a threat.
It is more a reward.

43:44.289 --> 43:46.489
The rest of your fee
is in the glove box.

43:46.491 --> 43:48.625
Destination is
pre-programmed

43:48.627 --> 43:51.828
on the GPS in
the vehicle.

43:53.597 --> 43:56.265
I get picked up driving a
stolen van, that's it, bro.

43:56.267 --> 44:00.136
They gonna send me back
to the bull pen.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.338
I can't go back.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.641
Can't do it, man.

44:07.444 --> 44:09.612
It is not stolen.

44:09.614 --> 44:12.181
You will be
let through

44:12.183 --> 44:13.850
and at the end of it

44:13.852 --> 44:17.620
your mother's immigration
status will be fixed.

44:17.622 --> 44:22.425
Your brother's criminal
record erased.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.930
I do this for you,
that's it, I'm done.

44:27.932 --> 44:29.599
Lose my number
and my address.

44:29.601 --> 44:32.035
I'm trying to do the right
thing by my mother now.

44:32.037 --> 44:33.970
'Cause if anything
happens to her

44:33.972 --> 44:37.940
I mean, anything...

44:37.942 --> 44:41.210
I'll kill your
waxy ass.

44:41.212 --> 44:42.779
Three rules--

44:42.781 --> 44:45.314
you will not examine
the cargo.

44:45.316 --> 44:47.650
You will not
make any stops.

44:47.652 --> 44:50.119
And you will cross
the bridge

44:50.121 --> 44:53.556
back into Manhattan
before daybreak.

44:53.558 --> 44:56.659
Do you understand?

44:56.661 --> 45:00.563
In English then,
the three rules.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.802
Screw you.

45:05.804 --> 45:08.705
Suck my dick.

45:08.707 --> 45:11.240
I'll get it done.

45:26.423 --> 45:28.991
<i>(airport terminal PA chatter)</i>

45:37.568 --> 45:40.169
<i>(crowd: urgent chatter)</i>

45:42.840 --> 45:47.744
Female yelling:
My daughter was on that flight!

45:49.046 --> 45:52.682
Fans chanting:
<i>Bolivar! Bolivar! Bolivar!</i>

45:59.123 --> 46:02.091
Sir, this area of the
airport is closed.

46:02.093 --> 46:04.360
You have to wait back there
with everybody else.

46:04.362 --> 46:06.763
Hey, settle down, will ya!

46:07.731 --> 46:11.100
Bolivar! Bolivar! Bolivar!

46:14.538 --> 46:16.939
¶

46:35.259 --> 46:40.463
Police officer:
<i>Hey, sir! Sir!</i>

46:40.465 --> 46:42.799
Sir!

46:42.801 --> 46:45.168
It's alright, sorry, just
go get a wheelchair.

46:45.170 --> 46:46.569
He's a medical.

46:46.571 --> 46:47.670
You all right?

46:47.672 --> 46:49.172
Sir, what do you
have here?

46:49.174 --> 46:50.640
You have... Coumadin.

46:50.642 --> 46:52.341
You got a heart
condition?

46:52.343 --> 46:54.076
Are you all right?

46:56.146 --> 46:58.014
Are you in charge?

46:58.016 --> 46:59.448
What?

46:59.450 --> 47:03.519
I need to talk to
someone about that plane.

47:06.623 --> 47:09.692
I recognize some of these names
in First Class.

47:10.627 --> 47:12.862
That never helps.

47:14.164 --> 47:17.700
Look, Eph, just
introduce yourself

47:17.702 --> 47:19.969
and tell them
we're on it.

47:19.971 --> 47:22.505
You'll do great.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.273
Go on.

47:26.977 --> 47:30.646
(crowd: urgent chatter)

47:30.648 --> 47:33.082
(reporters: indistinct shouting)

47:37.221 --> 47:41.090
When you said no press,
I almost believed you.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.368
I'm Ephraim Goodweather.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.036
I'm the Chief Medical Officer

47:54.038 --> 47:56.739
for the Centers for Disease
Control here in New York.

47:56.741 --> 47:58.808
<i>I have been asked to</i>
<i>introduce myself</i>

47:58.810 --> 48:00.810
<i>and to give you</i>
<i>a preliminary update on--</i>

48:00.812 --> 48:02.378
Reporter:
<i>How many survivors?</i>

48:02.380 --> 48:05.181
(reporters: indistinct shouting)

48:05.183 --> 48:08.351
Please...

48:08.353 --> 48:10.319
Please, please, please...

48:10.321 --> 48:12.588
(shouting stops)

48:16.493 --> 48:19.595
I think I'm supposed to stand
here and somehow reassure you.

48:21.431 --> 48:23.132
I can't do that.

48:26.336 --> 48:28.437
Two hundred and six passengers

48:28.439 --> 48:31.173
on Regis Air flight 753
are dead.

48:31.175 --> 48:32.708
And we don't know why.

48:32.710 --> 48:36.946
Four passengers survived,
and we don't know why.

48:36.948 --> 48:38.447
What I can tell you

48:38.449 --> 48:40.416
having been the first to board
the plane

48:40.418 --> 48:43.019
is that they all appeared to
have died peacefully

48:43.021 --> 48:44.620
without distress.

48:44.622 --> 48:47.256
That's the only comfort I can
give you at this time.

48:47.258 --> 48:49.058
(crowd: quiet sobbing)

48:49.060 --> 48:50.626
You want answers

48:50.628 --> 48:53.029
real answers to what happened on
that plane and so do I.

48:53.031 --> 48:54.964
And I won't quite until
we're all satisfied.

48:56.566 --> 48:58.634
Man:
<i>I don't care about your</i>
<i>promises!</i>

48:58.636 --> 49:00.436
I want my daughter back!

49:00.438 --> 49:03.439
<i>All you do is talk and talk!</i>
<i>That's all you do!</i>

49:03.441 --> 49:06.742
(crowd: muttering)

49:06.744 --> 49:08.577
This is my daughter.

49:08.579 --> 49:10.313
My daughter, Emma!

49:10.315 --> 49:13.616
And I want to see her again,
dead, alive.

49:13.618 --> 49:17.053
I'm her father!

49:17.055 --> 49:18.988
Don't you have children
of your own?

49:18.990 --> 49:20.790
Don't you have a heart?

49:29.599 --> 49:31.667
Forty-eight hours,
I'll get your answers.

49:31.669 --> 49:33.169
It's the best
I can do.

49:33.171 --> 49:34.270
No!

49:34.272 --> 49:36.305
(crowd: indistinct shouting)

49:38.275 --> 49:40.843
Jesus! Goodweather, what
are you doing to me here?

49:40.845 --> 49:42.478
Eph:
<i>Just tell me what you have.</i>

49:42.480 --> 49:43.946
I'm just getting into it now.

49:43.948 --> 49:45.848
I haven't finished cutting
all of them yet.

49:45.850 --> 49:47.616
Just give me
anything you can.

49:47.618 --> 49:50.319
Bennett:
<i>Okay, top of the charts...</i>

49:50.321 --> 49:52.655
is here.

49:54.324 --> 49:57.660
Can you see this here?

49:57.662 --> 49:59.862
Yeah, what is that?

50:00.664 --> 50:02.298
It's an incision.

50:02.300 --> 50:04.867
Deep enough to puncture one wall
of the carotid artery

50:04.869 --> 50:06.802
<i>without rupturing it.</i>

50:06.804 --> 50:10.139
<i>Razor sharp, clean cut,</i>
<i>no bruising, no trauma.</i>

50:10.141 --> 50:11.941
There's no instrument
that can do that.

50:11.943 --> 50:14.977
<i>Not that I'm aware of, anyway,</i>
<i>not with this precision.</i>

50:14.979 --> 50:16.012
Anything else?

50:16.014 --> 50:17.780
<i>Gets way more interesting.</i>

50:17.782 --> 50:20.816
A spot check of six other
corpses revealed the same thing.

50:20.818 --> 50:24.053
<i>The exact same wound,</i>
<i>in the exact same place.</i>

50:24.055 --> 50:25.654
Are you telling me

50:25.656 --> 50:28.124
that the other passengers
have the same incision?

50:28.126 --> 50:29.525
<i>Or puncture.</i>

50:29.527 --> 50:31.560
Yes, all the ones
I've looked at so far.

50:31.562 --> 50:35.231
There is one more intriguing
abnormality.

50:47.811 --> 50:50.046
Eph:
I don't... what the hell
am I looking at?

50:50.048 --> 50:52.248
Nora:
On our screen
that looks white.

50:52.250 --> 50:54.316
<i>Because it is white and</i>
<i>opalescent.</i>

50:54.318 --> 50:56.252
Nora:
Blood proteins
are separating.

50:56.254 --> 50:59.021
No, in fact, there's a complete
<i>absence of hypostasis.</i>

50:59.023 --> 51:00.723
<i>No blood pooling anywhere.</i>

51:00.725 --> 51:02.758
<i>And an absolute absence of</i>
<i>erythrocytes.</i>

51:02.760 --> 51:05.728
<i>I'll know more once I cut into</i>
<i>the liver and kidneys but...</i>

51:05.730 --> 51:07.396
I'm sorry to
do this to you

51:07.398 --> 51:09.732
but you're gonna have to
do the preliminary alone.

51:09.734 --> 51:11.934
I don't want any of this
leaking to the press.

51:11.936 --> 51:13.669
Okay, buddy,
but you'll owe me.

51:13.671 --> 51:15.538
For the rest
of my life.

51:15.540 --> 51:17.239
Shit.

51:19.242 --> 51:20.943
Eph! I'm sorry
but I think

51:20.945 --> 51:23.746
you're gonna want
to talk to this man.

51:26.917 --> 51:29.351
Dr. Goodweather, my name
is Abraham Setrakian.

51:29.353 --> 51:30.786
It's very nice
to meet you.

51:30.788 --> 51:32.421
I can't talk
right now.

51:32.423 --> 51:35.024
Eph, he says he has some insight
into the outbreak here.

51:35.026 --> 51:36.692
Great.

51:36.694 --> 51:39.428
Mr. Kent, here, can take
down your information--

51:39.430 --> 51:40.896
Time is of the
essence, Doctor.

51:40.898 --> 51:42.098
It certainly is.
Jim...

51:42.100 --> 51:43.232
Eph...

51:43.234 --> 51:44.867
You have to
listen to me.

51:44.869 --> 51:47.303
I have seen this
disease before.

51:47.305 --> 51:48.971
I have faced it
before.

51:48.973 --> 51:50.439
You... you must
contain it.

51:50.441 --> 51:52.108
You've seen it before?

51:52.110 --> 51:54.410
I assure you we're taking
every available precaution.

51:54.412 --> 51:55.744
You're not.
You can't.

51:55.746 --> 51:57.713
And he is counting
on that.

51:59.416 --> 52:00.649
"He?"

52:00.651 --> 52:03.819
It is too much to say
all at once here

52:03.821 --> 52:06.822
without sounding crazy.

52:08.091 --> 52:09.325
No, of course not.

52:09.327 --> 52:10.826
Uh, Jim, we're going
to the cargo hold.

52:10.828 --> 52:13.062
Please take care of
this gentleman for me.

52:13.064 --> 52:14.063
Thank you.

52:14.065 --> 52:15.431
It's okay.

52:15.433 --> 52:17.733
Just come with me.

52:17.735 --> 52:19.001
The bodies!

52:19.003 --> 52:21.270
They're not decomposing
normally, yes?!

52:21.272 --> 52:23.172
The tissues are
still pliable.

52:23.174 --> 52:25.274
- How do you know that?
- Nora, Nora...

52:25.276 --> 52:26.775
Listen to me now.

52:26.777 --> 52:29.578
<i>What I am about to say</i>
<i>I do not say lightly. </i>

52:29.580 --> 52:31.614
<i>All the passengers</i>
<i>on that plane</i>

52:31.616 --> 52:35.117
dead and alive...

52:35.119 --> 52:37.486
they must be destroyed.

52:39.289 --> 52:40.689
Destroyed? Okay.

52:40.691 --> 52:41.790
Here you go, fellas.

52:41.792 --> 52:43.025
Feel better.

52:43.027 --> 52:44.693
The heads must be severed!

52:44.695 --> 52:46.996
<i>The bodies burned,</i>
<i>destroyed!</i>

52:50.700 --> 52:52.935
Doctor, did you find
the coffin?

52:52.937 --> 52:55.971
If you have the coffin then
you still have him!

52:55.973 --> 52:57.506
<i>It is not too late!</i>

52:57.508 --> 52:58.941
Destroy the coffin!

52:58.943 --> 53:02.278
<i>Do not allow it</i>
<i>across the river!</i>

53:13.657 --> 53:15.791
As advised by
Doctor Goodweather

53:15.793 --> 53:19.361
I will examine the body under
UV light.

53:27.470 --> 53:29.738
¶

53:45.522 --> 53:48.524
Nora:
How did that old man
know about the coffin?

53:48.526 --> 53:50.359
Eph:
You mean
the cabinet?

53:50.361 --> 53:52.061
He called it
a coffin.

53:52.063 --> 53:53.662
I know what
he called it.

53:53.664 --> 53:57.066
He also told us to destroy
206 bodies.

53:57.068 --> 53:59.401
And he had a sword.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.105
Nora.

54:07.410 --> 54:09.612
What?

54:09.614 --> 54:11.847
What the hell
is that?

54:17.020 --> 54:18.754
Looks like a
horsehair worm

54:18.756 --> 54:22.791
or a Dirofilaria
immitis.

54:22.793 --> 54:25.461
Body is simple.
It's just collagen.

54:25.463 --> 54:29.031
Degenerate non-functional

54:31.034 --> 54:32.434
Look at that.

54:32.436 --> 54:33.969
It's beautiful.

54:33.971 --> 54:37.439
It's looking for a host,
it's desperate.

54:49.319 --> 54:53.422
So it's not airborne.

54:53.424 --> 54:55.190
That's the carrier.

Eph, look.

Soil.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.464
Hey!

55:35.466 --> 55:36.532
Where's that cabinet?

55:36.534 --> 55:38.033
What cabinet?

55:46.176 --> 55:47.843
Eph:
There, right there.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.144
Rewind.

55:49.146 --> 55:51.213
Can you go slower,
frame by frame?

55:51.215 --> 55:53.282
There must be a gap
or a cut.

55:53.284 --> 55:54.817
No, there's not cut.

55:54.819 --> 55:56.719
Watch the time code.

55:59.556 --> 56:01.357
Two seconds. Go back.

56:03.159 --> 56:04.493
Eph:
Start there.

56:04.495 --> 56:06.862
Wait, wait.

distortion?

56:12.870 --> 56:14.870
Foreman:
I don't know.

56:14.872 --> 56:18.674
It grabs the box
and lifts it off...

56:18.676 --> 56:22.344
up...

56:22.346 --> 56:23.645
That box was
500 pounds.

56:23.647 --> 56:25.414
Nothing could lift
it up like that.

56:25.416 --> 56:28.584
The old man said, "If you have
the coffin, you still have him."

Him.

57:49.300 --> 57:50.966

Stop everyone.

57:50.968 --> 57:52.501
This is an emergency.

57:52.503 --> 57:54.837
You need to seal off the

<i>That's the one. </i>

58:01.145 --> 58:02.678
Now listen carefully, Jim.

58:02.680 --> 58:05.781
We need to stop all vehicles big
enough to hold it.

58:05.783 --> 58:08.350
No vans, no trucks, nothing.

58:08.352 --> 58:10.853

Right, everybody listen up.

Step out of
the vehicle--

59:26.530 --> 59:29.164
- Get the light out of my face!
- Step out of the vehicle.

59:29.166 --> 59:30.666
Can I get my
seat belt?

59:41.511 --> 59:43.512
Hey. What's going
on here?

59:43.514 --> 59:47.182
I asked for ID,
he gave me this.

59:52.956 --> 59:54.890
Oh, well, this is
one of our vehicles.

59:54.892 --> 59:56.091
You can let
him through.

59:56.093 --> 59:57.092
Sir?

59:57.094 --> 59:58.994

him through.

1:00:05.269 --> 1:00:07.636
I came through for them

1:00:43.339 --> 1:00:47.576
The growths do not seem like
