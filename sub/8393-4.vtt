WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:01.717
- THERE WAS A VENDING MACHINE

00:01.820 --> 00:04.232
IN THE SCHOOL LAST YEAR,
BUT THEY TOOK IT OUT.

00:04.340 --> 00:05.921
I'M RUNNING FOR STUDENT COUNCIL
PRESIDENT--I'M GOING TO WIN.

00:06.040 --> 00:06.995
I'M GOING TO GET
THE SCHOOL BOARD

00:07.110 --> 00:08.919
TO BRING BACK
THE VENDING MACHINE.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.928
- KRISTINA'S SICK.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SICK?

00:11.040 --> 00:12.268

00:12.390 --> 00:14.073
AND YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
I'M TELLING, SO...

00:14.180 --> 00:15.795
SORRY SOME OF THIS STUFF
IS GONNA FALL ON YOU,

00:15.910 --> 00:18.492
BUT I'M GONNA KEEP ASKING YOU TO
DO SOME OF THESE THINGS FOR ME

00:18.600 --> 00:20.079
BECAUSE
I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

00:20.190 --> 00:21.976
- MRS. BRAVERMAN,
A LUMPECTOMY,

00:22.090 --> 00:23.978
PERFORMED SOONER
RATHER THAN LATER,

00:24.090 --> 00:25.466
OFFERS THE BEST CHANCE
OF REMISSION.

00:25.570 --> 00:30.086
I HAVE AN OPENING FRIDAY
THE 26TH AT 8:00 A.M.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.020
- [sighs]
- OKAY.

00:33.130 --> 00:35.690
ANY SECOND NOW.

00:37.340 --> 00:40.093
- I'M GOING BACK TO BED.
- NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT.

00:40.210 --> 00:41.962
YOU'RE GONNA MISS IT.
YOU'RE GONNA MISS IT.

00:42.070 --> 00:44.038
IT'S GONNA COME,
I SWEAR TO GOD.

00:44.140 --> 00:46.791
COME ON, IT'LL BE,...
IT'LL BE HERE.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.834
- I'M GOING BACK TO BED.

00:48.940 --> 00:50.316
- OH!

00:50.420 --> 00:53.492
LOOK! THERE.
SHH! NOW, LISTEN.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.010
YOU HEAR THAT?

00:55.120 --> 00:57.566
[water hissing]

01:01.950 --> 01:03.577
- NO.

01:03.680 --> 01:04.886
NO. IT SOUNDS FINE TO ME.

01:04.990 --> 01:05.672
_ OH--
- ZEEK, REALLY.

01:05.780 --> 01:07.407
- CAMILLE, IT'S NOT FINE.

01:07.510 --> 01:10.502
THERE'S LIKE AN AIR SOUND,
YOU KNOW?

01:10.620 --> 01:11.575
- HEY.
- UH-HUH?

01:11.690 --> 01:13.510
- YOU NEED A HOBBY.

01:18.110 --> 01:19.657
[engine rewing]

01:19.760 --> 01:22.342
- SPORTS. THEY'RE AN INCREDIBLE
WAY TO MAKE FRIENDS.

01:22.460 --> 01:23.654
- GREAT WAY.
- I'M STILL IN TOUCH

01:23.770 --> 01:25.044
WITH A NUMBER OF GIRLS
FROM MY SWIM TEAM.

01:25.150 --> 01:26.424
IN FACT,
JUST THE OTHER DAY,

01:26.530 --> 01:28.498
ONE OF THEM SENT ME
A MESSAGE ON FACEBOOK.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.942
- OH!
- AND SPORTS ARE FUN!

01:30.050 --> 01:31.972
- SUPER FUN.
- VIDEO GAMES ARE FUN.

01:32.090 --> 01:34.672
- I KNOW YOU LIKE WATCHING
BASEBALL WITH ME, YOU KNOW.

01:34.780 --> 01:36.293
THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING
YOU COULD DO.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.708
THAT WAS MY SPORT GROWING UP.
I LOVED IT.

01:37.820 --> 01:40.573
- OR YOU COULD TRY ONE OF
THE SPORTS THAT I DID--

01:40.680 --> 01:42.090
SWIMMING...
- SWIMMING'S GREAT.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.337
- SOCCER.
- GOOD FOR YOUR HEART.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.953
- VOLLEYBALL, TENNIS.

01:45.070 --> 01:46.549
I WAS BRIEFLY COMPETITIVE
IN GYMNASTICS

01:46.650 --> 01:48.231
BEFORE MY GROWTH SPURT.
- ANYWAY--

01:48.340 --> 01:49.022
- PROBABLY NOT. YEAH.
- IT'S YOUR CALL HERE.

01:49.140 --> 01:51.301
YOUR CHOICE.

01:51.420 --> 01:53.342
- SWEET.
THEN I CHOOSE NOTHING.

01:53.450 --> 01:56.339
[game sounds continue]

01:57.630 --> 01:59.621
- NOTHING...
IS NOT AN OPTION.

01:59.740 --> 02:01.526
- BUT YOU JUST SAID
IT WAS MY CHOICE.

02:01.630 --> 02:03.871
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA SIT
ON THIS COUCH EVERY AFTERNOON

02:03.980 --> 02:05.208
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

02:05.330 --> 02:07.389
YOU EITHER...PICK A SPORT

02:07.500 --> 02:09.843
OR YOU LEARN TO PLAY
THE VIOLIN.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.889
- FINE.
BASEBALL.

02:16.990 --> 02:19.333
EXCUSE ME.
- FINE.

02:21.340 --> 02:22.580
[game sounds resume]

02:22.690 --> 02:24.510
BASEBALL.

02:25.830 --> 02:28.310
- SO WE JUST WANTED
TO DISCUSS THE SURGERY DATE.

02:28.420 --> 02:29.864
- IS THERE A CONFLICT
WITH THE 26TH?

02:29.970 --> 02:31.346
- NO, MY WIFE JUST HAS...
- WELL, KIND OF, YES.

02:31.460 --> 02:32.859
- A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER
WE CAN MOVE IT.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.834
- MY SON IS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT OF STUDENT COUNCIL,

02:34.940 --> 02:36.350
AND HE HAS ASPERGER'S.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.007
HE JUST STARTED AT A NEW SCHOOL,
AND I NEED TO BE THERE.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.906
I'M THE ROOM MOM THAT DAY.
- I REALIZE THAT MIGHT SOUND

02:40.020 --> 02:41.908
KIND OF ASININE IN THE GREATER
SCHEME OF THINGS...

02:42.020 --> 02:43.772
- IT'S REALLY NOT--
- WHEN'S MY NEXT AVAILABLE?

02:43.880 --> 02:46.394
- YOU HAVE AN OPENING
THE 12TH OF NEXT MONTH.

02:46.510 --> 02:48.717
- DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU,
MRS. BRAVERMAN?

02:48.820 --> 02:50.538
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
I COULD BUY MORE TIME,

02:50.650 --> 02:52.368
AND, YOU KNOW,
WORK WITH THE CLASS--

02:52.480 --> 02:54.789
- BUT THAT'S THREE WEEKS.
IS THAT TOO LONG TO PUSH IT?

02:54.890 --> 02:56.266
- LOOK, I'VE ALREADY ADVISED YOU
TO HAVE THE SURGERY

02:56.380 --> 02:58.723
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,

02:58.830 --> 03:02.038
BUT IF THE 12TH IS THE SOONEST
POSSIBLE DATE FOR YOU,

03:02.140 --> 03:04.483
THEN WE WILL
DO IT ON THE 12TH.

03:04.590 --> 03:06.478
- I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SAYING
SOONER'S BETTER THAN LATER.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.739
I JUST WANT TO DO THE RIGHT
THING HERE, HONEY.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.933
- ALL RIGHT, MRS. BRAVERMAN,
YOU KNOW, PUSHING SURGERY

03:11.050 --> 03:12.768
BACK A FEW WEEKS IS NOT
THE END OF THE WORLD,

03:12.880 --> 03:14.529
BUT I HAVE A SENSE
THAT YOU'RE THE TYPE OF PERSON

03:14.640 --> 03:17.291
WHO PUTS YOUR FAMILY FIRST
AND YOURSELF LAST.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.459
- THAT'S TRUE.
- WELL, I MEAN, SORT OF--

03:19.570 --> 03:23.745
- YOU HAVE ONE JOB THIS YEAR,
MRS. BRAVERMAN,

03:23.850 --> 03:25.602
AND THAT IS TO FOCUS
ON GE'I'I'ING HEALTHY.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.711
THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING FOR YOU

03:27.820 --> 03:29.128
AND FOR YOUR FAMILY.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.708
- OKAY.

03:31.830 --> 03:35.038
- SO...THE 12TH.

03:35.140 --> 03:36.789
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

03:39.110 --> 03:40.418
- THE 12TH.

03:41.490 --> 03:44.459
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.767

04:56.840 --> 04:59.536

BUT WE DIDN'T

I EXPLAINED IT TO HIM.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.739
I SAID, YOU KNOW, IT'S
A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE WORD

06:47.850 --> 06:49.989
LIKE VOLDEMORT, YOU KNOW,
FROM HARRY POTTER.

06:50.090 --> 06:52.809

- YEAH, I KNOW,

06:52.920 --> 06:54.478
AND THAT WORD IS NOTHING
LIKE VOLDEMORT.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.649

I SAID IT WAS WORSE.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.648
LIKE WAY WORSE.
- ALL RIGHT, SO YOU...

07:00.690 --> 07:02.442
MAYBE NOT ENTIRELY.

07:02.560 --> 07:06.485
HE WAS STILL CONFUSED
BECAUSE DOUBLE D SAID IT,

07:06.590 --> 07:08.524
AND HE WANTED TO KNOW WHY
HE WAS ALLOWED TO SAY IT.

07:08.630 --> 07:10.484
- AND WHAT'D YOU SAY?
- WELL, I GOT KINDA FLUSTERED

07:10.600 --> 07:12.761
AND I SAID, YOU KNOW,
HE'S ALLOWED TO SAY IT

07:12.880 --> 07:14.768
'CAUSE HE'S BLACK, AND THEN
JABBAR SAID, "I'M BLACK.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.632
CAN I SAY IT?"
AND I SAID NO.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.355
HE SAID, "WHY?"
AND THEN I SAID,

07:18.470 --> 07:19.846
VOLDEMORT AGAIN.

07:19.950 --> 07:22.532
AND THEN I GOT--
I JUST--I GOT FLUSTERED.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.221
- RIGHT.
- I'M SORRY.

07:24.340 --> 07:25.819

07:25.920 --> 07:28.229
I MEAN...OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THIS.

07:28.340 --> 07:29.568
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

07:29.690 --> 07:31.305
I NEED TO HAVE
"THE TALK" WITH HIM.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.059
- YOU WILL HAVE THE TALK
WITH HIM.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.785
- YES, I WILL.
- MOMMY, CAN I HAVE SOME JUICE?

07:34.900 --> 07:36.583

07:51.260 --> 07:52.352
- FRANKLY, I'M TEAM GALE.

07:52.470 --> 07:53.869
SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER IT
CONTROVERSIAL.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.844
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
- YOU'VE READ THIS?

07:55.950 --> 07:57.577
OF COURSE YOU'VE READ THIS.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.022

ACTUALLY, THIS IS PERFECT.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.052
YOU TELL ME WHAT THIS
WHOLE THING'S ABOUT.

08:01.170 --> 08:02.671
GIVE ME LIKE A BOOK REPORT
ABOUT THIS,

08:02.790 --> 08:04.234
AND THEN YOU CAN
GO HOME EARLY.

08:04.340 --> 08:06.547
- WHY DO YOU NEED A BOOK REPORT
ON THE HUNGER GAMES?

08:06.650 --> 08:08.538
- BECAUSE IT'S MY DAUGHTER'S
FAVORITE BOOK.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.378
- REALLY?
- YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.377

SHE USED TO BE EASY
TO TALK TO,

08:14.140 --> 08:15.619
AND NOW SHE'S NOT.

08:15.730 --> 08:18.972
I GUESS I'M TRYING TO RELATE.
- NO, I GET IT.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.934
I SPENT MANY HOURS PLAYING
HALO 3TRYING TO RELATE.

08:21.050 --> 08:22.358
I DIDN'T KNOW

08:22.460 --> 08:23.836
- YES, I DO.
- WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

08:23.950 --> 08:27.772
- WHAT DO YOU--
SHE'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SUMMARIZE.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.155

08:43.100 --> 08:46.069
AND NOW SHE'S KIND OF
GROWN INTO HERSELF,

08:46.180 --> 08:47.579
I GUESS, WHICH IS GREAT,

08:47.690 --> 08:49.203
BUT IT ALSO SCARES ME.

08:49.320 --> 08:53.245
I REMEMBER WHEN SHE USED TO
NEED ME FOR EVERYTHING,

08:53.360 --> 08:55.931
AND...SHE WAS THIS JUST...

08:56.050 --> 08:59.326
LIKE A BIG PILE OF LOVE
THAT WOULDN'T LEAVE MY SIDE.

08:59.430 --> 09:02.638
- DREW WAS LIKE THAT
AT THAT AGE.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.981
- ANYWAY, SO...

09:05.090 --> 09:08.571
HER MOM...
MAKES IT KIND OF TOUGH.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.240
SHE ONLY LETS HER COME UP
FROM L.A. ONCE A MONTH,

09:11.340 --> 09:12.716
AND EVEN THAT'S A FIGHT.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.448
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S SAD
AND PATHETIC

09:15.550 --> 09:17.711
THAT I'M READING
THE HUNGER GAMES,

09:17.830 --> 09:22.278
BUT, UH...SHE IS AT
THAT AGE WHERE...

09:23.830 --> 09:26.481
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
IT'S JUST 'CAUSE I'M HER DAD,

09:26.600 --> 09:28.386
BUT...

09:28.490 --> 09:29.900
1--
[stammers]

09:30.010 --> 09:33.138
PLEASE STOP TORTURING ME.
JUST TELL ME WHAT...

09:33.260 --> 09:35.148
WHY SHOULD I BE TEAM GALE?

09:36.880 --> 09:40.577
- OKAY...
[whispering under breath]

09:42.470 --> 09:45.507
NO.
I CAN'T DO THIS HERE.

09:45.610 --> 09:46.850
[door opens]
OH, MY GOD. OKAY.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.507
- MOM. I NEED YOU
TO GO TO THE STORE.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.269
I NEED PENS AND POSTER BOARD...
- OKAY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.995
- FOR THE CAMPAIGN.
- WHERE'S DAD, BUDDY? HOLD ON.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.852
I'M JUST TRYING TO FINISH--
- HE DROPPED ME OFF.

09:53.970 --> 09:55.483
GRANDPA HAD AN EMERGENCY.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH GRANDPA?

09:55.590 --> 09:56.898
IS HE OKAY?
- I DON'T KNOW, MOM.

09:57.010 --> 09:58.341
DID YOU HEAR ME?
- YEAH, I'M LISTENING, MAX.

09:58.450 --> 10:00.486
HOLD ON A SECOND--LET ME FINISH
TWO THINGS, OKAY?

10:00.600 --> 10:01.931
ONE, TWO.
DONE.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.905
OKAY, LISTEN, WE'LL MAKE A LIST.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

10:04.010 --> 10:05.420
WHAT DO YOU NEED, PENS, PAPER?
- I NEED PENS,

10:05.530 --> 10:07.942
AND I NEED POSTER BOARD
FOR MY CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT.

10:08.050 --> 10:10.223
- ALSO YOU NEED TO GET THOSE 25
SIGNATURES FOR THAT PETITION.

10:10.330 --> 10:11.945
- I GOT THEM.
- OTHERWISE, YOU'RE NOT GONNA

10:12.050 --> 10:13.870
BE ABLE TO--
- I GOT THEM.

10:13.990 --> 10:15.878
- YOU GOT ALL 25 SIGNATURES?
- YEAH, I GOT ALL 25.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.198
BUT I HAD TO ASK 29 PEOPLE,
BECAUSE 4 SAID NO.

10:19.300 --> 10:23.088
- YOU WALKED UP TO 29 PEOPLE--
- YES, I DID.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.760
I WALKED UP TO THEM,
AND I STUCK MY HAND OUT,

10:25.860 --> 10:27.725
AND I SAID,
"HI. I'M MAX BRAVERMAN,

10:27.830 --> 10:29.206
"AND I NEED YOUR SIGNATURE

10:29.310 --> 10:31.107
TO RUN FOR STUDENT
COUNCIL PRESIDENT,"

10:31.210 --> 10:32.654
AND THEN I LOOKED THEM
IN THE EYE, AND I SMILED.

10:32.770 --> 10:34.522
- I AM SO INCREDIBLY PROUD
OF YOU.

10:34.630 --> 10:36.006
- I DIDN'T LIKE THAT PART.
- I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T, MAX.

10:36.110 --> 10:37.793
HIGH FIVE.
THAT IS AMAZING!

10:37.910 --> 10:40.003
CAN I SEE THAT?
- YEAH. BUT I HAVE TO

10:40.120 --> 10:42.179
TURN IT IN TO THE STUDENT
ACTIVITIES.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.855
- WHAT AM I LISTENING FOR?
- YOU HEAR THAT?

10:58.960 --> 11:00.370
- I HEAR A SPRINKLER.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.994
DAD, YOU CALLED ME AND YOU SAID
YOU HAD AN EMERGENCY.

11:03.110 --> 11:04.657
- YOU DON'T HEAR THAT?
- THIS IS NOT AN EMERGENCY.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.204
AN EMERGENCY
WOULD BE A FLOOD.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.003
- I THINK THERE'S AIR
IN THE SYSTEM.

11:08.110 --> 11:10.169
- ADAM? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA.

11:10.290 --> 11:12.520
- SHH! JUST PIPE DOWN,
WOULD YOU?

11:12.630 --> 11:13.699
- IS HE TRYING TO GET YOU
INVOLVED

11:13.810 --> 11:15.289
WITH THIS SPRINKLER THING?
- YEAH.

11:15.390 --> 11:16.834
- 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THE SPRINKLERS.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.520
- CLEARLY.
- THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY FINE.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.528
HE'S BORED.
THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

11:20.640 --> 11:21.948
- HEY, YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
CAMILLE?

11:22.060 --> 11:22.947
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.
I CAN HEAR YOU.

11:23.060 --> 11:25.267
- OH, CAN YOU?
- YEAH.

11:25.370 --> 11:27.019
- OH, REALLY?
- UH-HUH.

11:27.130 --> 11:28.859
- 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN ASKING YOU
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS NOW

11:28.960 --> 11:30.746
TO GO DOWN TO THE V.A.
THEY HAVE A VOLUNTEER PROGRAM

11:30.860 --> 11:32.714
DOWN THERE--HE WOULD BE
SO GREAT FOR THE PROGRAM.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.138
THEY COULD REALLY
USE SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.470
AND IT WOULD MAKE HIM
FEEL NEEDED,

11:36.590 --> 11:38.797
AND HE WOULDN'T BE SO FOCUSED
ON THE DAMN SPRINKLER SYSTEM.

11:38.900 --> 11:39.935
- DON'T PUT ADAM
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.382
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT
THE V.A.

11:41.490 --> 11:43.720
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE SPRINKLERS EITHER.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.489
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
I'M STILL STANDING HERE.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.760
THEY'RE FINE!

11:46.870 --> 11:48.383
- ADAM.
- WHAT?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.661
- I NEED YOUR HELP.
- YOU DON'T NEED MY HELP.

11:50.770 --> 11:51.873
THE SPRINKLERS ARE WORKING FINE.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.595
THE PLANTS
ARE ALL GETI'ING WATER.

11:53.710 --> 11:55.769
WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO MOM
AND GO VOLUNTEER AT THE V.A.?

11:55.880 --> 11:57.461
- DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER!
I'D RATHER LISTEN

11:57.570 --> 11:59.777
TO THE AIR IN THE SYSTEM--
- THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

11:59.890 --> 12:02.336
- IN THE SPRINKLERS!
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD, GO!

12:02.440 --> 12:05.000
GO!

12:11.590 --> 12:12.898
- THEY'RE GURGLING!

12:13.000 --> 12:15.275
- EVERYBODY'S GOT A CUP, RIGHT?
- YEP.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.029
- I DIDN'T EVEN TELL YOU
THE BEST PART, BUDDY.

12:17.150 --> 12:19.550
YOUR SPONSOR FOR THE TEAM
IS A PIZZA PLACE.

12:19.660 --> 12:20.979
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

12:21.080 --> 12:22.559
WIN OR LOSE, PIZZA PARTY.

12:22.670 --> 12:25.218
- JUST 15 MINUTES, RIGHT?

12:25.330 --> 12:27.469
- YEAH, JUST MEET THE COACH
AND THEN GET YOUR UNIFORM.

12:27.570 --> 12:29.709
BUT I HAVE A FEELING AFTER YOU
GET THAT GLOVE IN YOUR HAND,

12:29.810 --> 12:30.947
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
WANT TO LEAVE.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.846
UH, HI.
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

12:32.950 --> 12:34.053
IT'S TOTALLY MY FAULT.

12:34.160 --> 12:34.740
- HEY, NO WORRIES.
- JOEL GRAHAM.

12:34.850 --> 12:36.192
- COACH FULTON.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.985
ALL RIGHT, GO GEAR UP
WITH COACH TONY.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.544
[boys shouting]
HUSTLE!

12:40.650 --> 12:41.639
YOU MUST BE VICTOR?
- YEAH.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.819
- WELCOME TO THE PANTHERS,
VICTOR.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.784
OW! THAT'S SOME GRIP
YOU GOT.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.891
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THAT ARM ON THE FIELD.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.821
OKAY, SEE THAT NICE MAN THERE
WITH THE BLUE HAT?

12:50.940 --> 12:52.521
HE'S GONNA GET YOU HOOKED UP
WITH A MI'IT AND A PARTNER

12:52.630 --> 12:54.382
FOR A LITTLE BIT OF CATCH.
- OKAY.

12:54.490 --> 12:56.117
- SOUND LIKE FUN?
- SURE.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.563
- OKAY.
- JUST, UH...

12:58.670 --> 13:00.831
FIRST DAY JI'I'TERS,
I GUESS.

13:00.950 --> 13:02.281
- YOU OR HIM?

13:02.400 --> 13:04.459
[both chuckle]

13:06.640 --> 13:08.050
- OKAY.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.264
- WELL, I HAVE A FEELING
HUGH JASS, SEYMOUR BUTTS,

13:10.370 --> 13:13.294
AND REE TARD DIDN'T SIGN
ANYBODY ELSE'S PETITION.

13:13.410 --> 13:14.195
- I KNOW. THAT'S THE ONE
THAT KILLS ME, THE REE TARD ONE.

13:14.310 --> 13:16.369
IT'S SO MEAN.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE

13:16.480 --> 13:18.277
HOW MEAN LITTLE SCHOOL KIDS
CAN BE.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.859
- IF THEY KNEW HOW HARD IT WAS
FOR HIM TO WALK UP TO THEM

13:19.970 --> 13:21.301
AND ASK THEM TO SIGN
THE PETITION,

13:21.420 --> 13:24.514
THEY'RE MEAN KIDS,
BUT THIS CAN BE FIXED.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.621
- WE HAVE TO ASK MAX
NOT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

13:26.730 --> 13:28.311
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.
- HONEY...

13:28.420 --> 13:29.557
NO, I CAN HANDLE THIS.

13:29.670 --> 13:30.864
- I CAN'T LET HIM
DO THIS, HONEY.

13:30.980 --> 13:32.902
- KIDS ARE MEAN.
- STUDENT COUNCIL

13:33.010 --> 13:34.329
IS FOR THE POPULAR KIDS,
AND HE DOESN'T GET THAT,

13:34.430 --> 13:36.159
AND WE ARE SETTING HIM UP
FOR FAILURE.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.421
- ADAM, HE WALKED UP TO EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE KIDS

13:38.540 --> 13:40.849
AND ASKED THEM TO SIGN
THE PETITION, OKAY?

13:40.950 --> 13:42.884
THAT WAS A HUGE EFFORT
ON HIS PART.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.742
HE SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED
FOR THAT.

13:44.850 --> 13:46.021
- I GET IT--I'M TRYING TO
PROTECT HIM, HONEY.

13:46.130 --> 13:47.813
THIS IS GONNA END BADLY,
OKAY?

13:47.930 --> 13:49.374
AND I THINK THAT
HE COULD REGRESS,

13:49.480 --> 13:51.892
AND EVERYTHING WE'VE WORKED FOR
COULD JUST DISAPPEAR.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.274
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.166
- I'M FINE.
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,

13:55.280 --> 13:57.066
WE SHOULDN'T LET HIM RUN?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

13:57.180 --> 13:58.556
- YEAH. I THINK THAT
WE HAVE TO TELL HIM

13:58.660 --> 13:59.820
THAT HE CAN'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.521
- HE'S GONNA COMPLETELY
FREAK OUT.

14:01.630 --> 14:03.939
HE'S GONNA FREAK OUT.
- YEAH, HE'S GONNA FREAK OUT.

14:04.050 --> 14:06.518
AND HE'LL GET OVER IT.
THAT'S LIFE.

14:13.990 --> 14:15.708
- YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE REALLY QUIET

14:15.820 --> 14:17.321
IN DR. BEDSLOE'S OFFICE
YESTERDAY

14:17.440 --> 14:20.603
WHEN I RESCHEDULED
MY SURGERY.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.472
JUST...

14:24.480 --> 14:27.096
- IT'S YOUR DECISION.

14:41.460 --> 14:42.870
- WELL, THIS IS SHAPING UP
TO BE QUITE A YEAR,

14:42.980 --> 14:44.117
HUH, PAL?
GOT OUR LITTLE NIPPER HERE,

14:44.220 --> 14:45.949
LITTLE OTIS, AND HADDIE
WENT OFF TO COLLEGE.

14:46.050 --> 14:48.018
YOU STARTED AT A NEW SCHOOL.
THAT'S A BIG CHANGE.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.394
- MM-HMM.
YOU HAVE A NEW SCHEDULE,

14:49.500 --> 14:51.320
YOU HAVE FOUR NEW TEACHERS
INSTEAD OF ONE.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.499
YOU HAVE TO SWITCH CLASSROOMS,
WHICH IS A LITTLE HECTIC.

14:53.610 --> 14:55.430
- THAT'S A NEW THING.
- THAT'S A LOT TO HANDLE,

14:55.540 --> 14:56.882
AND YOU'RE DOING
SUCH A GOOD JOB AT IT.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.332
- AND THE SCHOOL
IS MUCH, MUCH BIGGER.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.681
A LOT OF KIDS.
- OH, IT'S SO MUCH BIGGER.

15:00.790 --> 15:02.234
- SO...YOUR MOTHER AND I FEEL

15:02.340 --> 15:05.059
THAT WE SHOULD JUST
EMBRACE ALL THIS NEW CHANGE.

15:05.180 --> 15:07.444
MAX, CAN YOU LOOK AT ME
FOR A SECOND?

15:07.560 --> 15:08.936
WE DON'T WANNA OVERDO IT,

15:09.040 --> 15:11.622
SO WE THINK
THAT IT'S PROBABLY BEST

15:11.730 --> 15:14.005
TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR
TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.769
- NO. THE VENDING MACHINE
IS GONE NOW,

15:15.880 --> 15:17.359
AND AS PRESIDENT,
I'LL BRING IT BACK.

15:17.460 --> 15:18.973
- RIGHT, BUT--
- OKAY, LISTEN TO MOM NOW.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.318
YOU DID SUCH A GREAT JOB

15:20.430 --> 15:23.012
GETTING THAT PETITION SIGNED
BY ALL THOSE KIDS.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.530
AMAZING JOB,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:24.640 --> 15:26.699
AS A REWARD, WE CAN GET YOU
THOSE SKITTLES.

15:26.820 --> 15:28.299
WE'LL BUY YOU A TON OF SKITTLES,

15:28.410 --> 15:30.435
AND THE VENDING MACHINE THING
WON'T EVEN BE AN ISSUE.

15:30.550 --> 15:31.812
- IT'S STILL AN ISSUE.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.124
IT'S AN ISSUE
BECAUSE IT'S UNFAIR.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.719
- I KNOW THAT IT'S UNFAIR,
MAX,

15:34.830 --> 15:36.786
BUT OUR MOTHER AND I WANT TO DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU,

15:36.900 --> 15:38.959
AND ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT WE
SHOULD WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR

15:39.070 --> 15:40.378
FOR YOU TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
- NO. NO.

15:40.490 --> 15:42.173
- WE DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU
GET DISTRACTED--

15:42.280 --> 15:43.793
- TO BECOME THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

15:43.900 --> 15:45.902
YOU HAVE TO BE 35 YEARS OLD
AND A NATURAL-BORN CITIZEN.

15:46.010 --> 15:47.409
TO BECOME STUDENT COUNCIL
PRESIDENT

15:47.530 --> 15:49.521
AT CEDAR KNOLL MIDDLE SCHOOL,
YOU HAVE TO BE A STUDENT

15:49.630 --> 15:52.144
IN GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING
WHO HAS COLLECTED 25 SIGNATURES.

15:52.260 --> 15:53.522
I AM BOTH OF THOSE THINGS.
- YEP, YOU ARE.

15:53.640 --> 15:54.629
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE

15:54.740 --> 15:56.492
SCHOOLWORK GET DISRUPTED
BY THIS.

15:56.610 --> 15:58.396
- NO. YOU CAN'T TELL ME
NOT TO RUN.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.365
THAT'S FASCIST!
YOU'RE BOTH FASCISTS!

16:00.470 --> 16:02.028
- WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT FASCISTS.
- WE'RE NOT FASCISTS.

16:02.130 --> 16:04.473
- YOU KNOW,
IT'S AN ASSAULT TO MY FREEDOM.

16:04.580 --> 16:05.888
I'M REPORTING YOU BOTH

16:05.990 --> 16:07.924
TO THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN
ACTIVITIES COMMISSION.

16:08.030 --> 16:09.543
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT, DO THAT.

16:09.650 --> 16:11.789
YOU MIGHT HAVE A TOUGH TIME
GETTING IN TOUCH WITH THEM,

16:11.900 --> 16:13.959
'CAUSE THE HOUSE UN-AMERICAN
ACTIVITIES COMMUNITY'S

16:14.070 --> 16:16.243
BEEN DISBANDED
FOR BEING UN-AMERICAN!

16:22.560 --> 16:25.040
- I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO GO
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.629
- ALL RIGHT, TELL ME
WHAT YOU DO WANNA DO.

16:26.740 --> 16:28.662
- I REALLY DON'T CARE.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.736
- HI.
- HEY.

16:30.850 --> 16:32.465
RUBY, THIS IS MY NEW
ASSISTANT SARAH.

16:32.570 --> 16:34.322
- HI! IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.056
- NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.
- I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.058
- YEAH?
- YEAH!

16:38.160 --> 16:39.434
- YEAH. COOL.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.188
- SO...

16:41.310 --> 16:43.687
WHAT HAPPENED TO MINI GOLF?

17:02.260 --> 17:04.319
SO...

17:06.430 --> 17:09.365
- THE ONLY THING I REALLY KNOW
ABOUT THE VFW

17:09.470 --> 17:12.223
IS YOU CAN GET $2 WHISKEY SHOTS.

17:12.340 --> 17:13.648
- YEAH, THERE'S THAT.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.503
BUT WE ALSO PROVIDE
SERVICES TO VETERANS.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.515

17:20.620 --> 17:22.372

RESPON DING TO EMAILS.

17:29.320 --> 17:30.628
- WELL, YEAH, OKAY,

17:30.730 --> 17:32.527
WHY DON'T WE JUST
CUT TO THE CHASE HERE?

17:32.630 --> 17:34.837
YOU SEE, MY WIFE WANTS ME
AWAY FROM THE HOUSE

17:34.950 --> 17:36.258
FOR LIKE THREE HOURS,

17:36.360 --> 17:39.249
SO WHAT DO YOU GOT THAT KINDA
FILLS THAT TIME?

17:41.610 --> 17:43.987
- THE REFRESHMENT TABLE'S
LOOKING A LITTLE THIN.

17:44.090 --> 17:47.150
HOW ARE YOU AT MAKING COFFEE?

17:51.240 --> 17:52.821
- ARE YOU SURE THAT WE HAVE TO
DO THIS RIGHT NOW?

17:52.930 --> 17:55.649
I JUST FEEL LIKE MAYBE WE'RE
GONNA SHATTER HIS INNOCENCE,

17:55.760 --> 17:57.068
AND HE'S SO YOUNG.

17:57.170 --> 17:59.274
- YEAH. I'M NOT THRILLED
ABOUT IT EITHER,

17:59.380 --> 18:01.348
BUT...HAS TO HAPPEN.

18:01.450 --> 18:03.384
- BECAUSE YOU SAID
IT NEEDS TO.

18:03.490 --> 18:05.105
- NO, BECAUSE
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

18:05.220 --> 18:07.108
- I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PULLING
RANK A LITTLE BIT

18:07.220 --> 18:10.599
BECAUSE...YOU KNOW.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.494
YOU KNOW?
- BECAUSE I'M BLACK?

18:13.600 --> 18:15.181
- BECAUSE YOU'RE BLACK.
YEAH.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.507
I FEEL LIKE YOU PULLED RANK.
- [laughs]

18:17.610 --> 18:19.430
BABY, YOU HAVE TO RESPECT
THE FACT

18:19.540 --> 18:22.225
THAT I HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING
ON THE SUBJECT THAT YOU DON'T.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.922
AND THE FACT IS, THAT WORD

18:25.030 --> 18:28.648
MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT
TO JABBAR BECAUSE HE'S BLACK.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.204
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FAIR.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.414
BUT HE'S ALSO HALF-WHITE.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.136
- RIGHT. WHICH, YOU KNOW,
HE CAN USE HIS WHITE CARD

18:35.250 --> 18:36.763
WHEN HE GETS PULLED OVER
BY THE COPS

18:36.870 --> 18:38.246
FOR DRIVING WHILE BLACK.

18:38.350 --> 18:39.999
HE CAN JUST SAY,
"I'M ACTUALLY HALF-WHITE."

18:40.110 --> 18:41.077
- [laughs] OKAY.
HE'S EIGHT YEARS OLD,

18:41.180 --> 18:42.522
AND WE LIVE IN BERKELEY,

18:42.630 --> 18:45.190
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA BE
HAPPENING ANYTIME SOON.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.178
- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
THAT NAIVE.

18:47.290 --> 18:49.872
LOOK, THERE ARE THINGS
IN THE WORLD THAT AREN'T PRETTY,

18:49.990 --> 18:52.606
AND EVENTUALLY, HE'S GONNA HEAR
SOMETHING HE SHOULDN'T.

18:52.710 --> 18:53.950
LIKE WHAT HAPPENED.

18:54.060 --> 18:57.359
AND I WOULD JUST RATHER HIM
HEAR THE TRUTH FROM ME

18:57.480 --> 19:00.051
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

19:00.170 --> 19:00.955
- OKAY.
I WANNA BE THERE, THOUGH.

19:01.070 --> 19:03.095
- OKAY.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.064

19:11.770 --> 19:13.795

WE GOT THE GOURMET STUFF
IN AFGHANISTAN.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.099

RYAN YORK?

20:12.240 --> 20:13.514
- OH, THIS ISN'T HOME.

20:13.620 --> 20:16.657
MY MOM WANTED ME

20:58.250 --> 21:00.309

WOULDN'T BE

21:00.430 --> 21:03.319
OUTSIDE OF YOUR RANGE

21:03.430 --> 21:06.775

21:16.960 --> 21:18.951
HE KEEPS DOING THIS THING
WITH HIS ELBOW.

SEE, DYLAN SPENT A WHOLE
SUMMER PLAYING XBOX

21:21.830 --> 21:23.445

21:25.970 --> 21:28.177
MY BOY VICTOR.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.009
SORRY, THAT WAS
A TERRIBLE SEGUE.

21:30.110 --> 21:31.623
HE'S NEW AND I'M NEW.
I'M JOEL.

21:31.730 --> 21:33.049

- VICTOR--

22:37.280 --> 22:39.419
- YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD!

- RUBY, THIS--IT'S HOW I MAKE
A LIVING, OKAY?

22:49.980 --> 22:51.186
COME ON, IT'S SEA OTTERS.
- WHY CAN'T I JUST STAY HERE?

22:51.300 --> 22:53.871
- LOOK, I REALLY--I THOUGHT
THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING

22:53.990 --> 22:54.740
THAT YOU WOULD ENJOY.

SO DIFFICULT ABOUT THIS?

23:06.450 --> 23:08.611
I'M 11.
I'LL JUST STAY HERE.

23:08.730 --> 23:11.176
- NO, YOU WON'T STAY HERE.
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE BY YOURSELF.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.408
- I'M NOT BY MYSELF!
SHE'S HERE.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.828
- UM, SHE CAN STAY WITH ME.

23:21.880 --> 23:23.086
- OKAY, GREAT.

23:23.190 --> 23:25.704
ONLY BE A COUPLE HOURS.

23:25.810 --> 23:28.916

[door slams]

23:31.030 --> 23:33.919
[cheerful folk music]

23:35.510 --> 23:36.989
- BUT MY OPINION IS NOT BEING
GIVEN ANY WEIGHT,

23:37.100 --> 23:39.307
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S
BECAUSE I'M WHITE,

23:39.410 --> 23:41.230
WHICH IS--

23:41.350 --> 23:42.897
- YEAH.
- IT'S WEIRD.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.752
- NO, IT'S--IT'S HARD BEING
A WHITE MAN IN THIS COUNTRY.

23:44.870 --> 23:46.963
- HMM. LOOK, I KNOW
THE WORLD'S NOT A PERFECT PLACE,

23:47.080 --> 23:50.038
BUT JABBAR'S WORLD
IS PERFECT, OKAY?

23:50.150 --> 23:52.618
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU THINK
THAT SYCAMORE PLAYGROUND

23:52.740 --> 23:54.219
IS A HOTBED OF RACIAL TENSION...
[cell phone dings]

23:54.320 --> 23:57.209
BUT IT'S NOT, OKAY?
I'VE BEEN THERE.

23:57.330 --> 23:59.184
- WHOA. I GOTTA GO. I GOTTA GO.
- ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

23:59.290 --> 24:01.053
HOLD ON. WHAT ARE YOU--

24:01.160 --> 24:03.082
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

24:03.200 --> 24:04.087
YOU SEE THAT?

24:04.200 --> 24:05.679
- BUSY, I GUESS.

24:05.780 --> 24:07.850
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I SYMPATHIZE.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.678
I MEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE
THERE'S NO EASY ANSWER.

24:09.790 --> 24:11.576
YOU GUYS BOTH HAVE
GOOD POINTS.

24:11.690 --> 24:12.918
- AND WHAT DID--
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

24:13.030 --> 24:14.782
- SHE AGREED,
AND SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

24:14.900 --> 24:15.889
A BAD IDEA.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.797
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A HUGE STRUGGLE

24:17.900 --> 24:19.208
FOR A KID LIKE MAX.
- OKAY, GOOD.

24:19.310 --> 24:20.629
- SHE KEPT SAYING,
"A KID LIKE MAX.

24:20.730 --> 24:21.697
A KID LIKE MAX."
I WANTED TO CHOKE HER.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.176
- ALL RIGHT, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.690
BUT AT LEAST WE'RE ALL
ON THE SAME PAGE HERE.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.903
- WE'RE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE,
ADAM.

24:26.010 --> 24:28.353
I THINK THAT WE
SHOULD LET HIM RUN.

24:28.460 --> 24:29.768
- KRISTINA, WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.802
- I THINK WE'RE NOT ADMITTING
THIS, BUT THE REAL REASON

24:31.910 --> 24:33.013
THAT WE'RE NOT LETTING HIM RUN
IS BECAUSE OF ME.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.566
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- IT IS, AND I'M--I'M NOT--

24:35.680 --> 24:36.704
I CAN'T ACCEPT THAT.
I'M SORRY.

24:36.820 --> 24:38.196
- WELL, WHEN HE GETS CREAMED,

24:38.300 --> 24:39.506
AND NOT A SINGLE KID
VOTES FOR HIM, WHAT THEN?

24:39.610 --> 24:40.816
- HE LEARNS TO LOSE.

24:40.920 --> 24:42.547
- WELL, OR HE COULD GO
INTO A BIG REGRESSION,

24:42.650 --> 24:45.164
AND YOU'RE--

24:45.270 --> 24:48.785
- AND I'M WHAT?

24:48.900 --> 24:49.855
- NOTHING.

24:49.970 --> 24:51.346
- I'M NOT GONNA MAKE
A DECISION

24:51.450 --> 24:52.894
BASED ON WHAT I MIGHT FEEL LIKE
TWO MONTHS FROM NOW.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.820
I'M--I'M JUST NOT
GONNA DO THAT.

24:54.940 --> 24:59.001
- LOOK, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
WHEN I GET HOME, OKAY?

24:59.110 --> 25:00.008
- OKAY.

25:00.110 --> 25:01.281
[phone beeps]

25:14.850 --> 25:17.296
[banging]

25:17.410 --> 25:18.786
- OH, PBBT.

25:18.890 --> 25:20.539
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

25:20.650 --> 25:21.571
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T.

25:21.690 --> 25:23.681
I REALLY DON'T.
DO YOU HAVE ANY?

25:23.790 --> 25:26.065
- UM, WELL, YOU DON'T WANT
TO AIM THE LIGHT

25:26.170 --> 25:27.239
DIRECTLY AT IT.

25:27.350 --> 25:28.203
IT SHOULD COME
FROM THE SIDE.

25:28.310 --> 25:30.892
- OH. HUH.
LIKE HOW?

25:31.010 --> 25:32.454
I MEAN, LIKE HERE?
- WHEREVER.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.549
- WOULD YOU MIND SHOWING ME?

25:33.670 --> 25:35.103
I'M JUST KIND OF--
I'M VERY NEW.

25:35.220 --> 25:36.619
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

25:36.740 --> 25:38.048
I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY,
BUT I THINK I'D GET IT

25:38.150 --> 25:39.378
IF YOU COULD SHOW IT TO ME
JUST QUICKLY.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.489
- SURE.
- YEAH? THANKS.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.589
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY.

25:41.710 --> 25:42.699
WHERE SHOULD I BE?

25:42.810 --> 25:44.220
- UH, JUST SIT THERE...
- OKAY.

25:44.330 --> 25:45.911
- AND I'LL DO THE WORK.

25:46.020 --> 25:48.500
THIS GOES...

25:48.610 --> 25:49.645
AROUND A LITTLE MORE.

25:49.750 --> 25:50.603
- OH, OVER THERE?
- YEAH.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.641
- OH, MY GOD.

25:51.750 --> 25:52.921
HOW EASY YOU MAKE THIS LOOK.

25:53.030 --> 25:54.258
HOW DO YOU DO IT?

25:54.380 --> 25:56.234
- WELL, I'VE BEEN HELPING
MY DAD OUT IN THE STUDIO

25:56.340 --> 25:57.580
SINCE I WAS LIKE FIVE.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.373
- OH, YEAH, HE TOLD ME THAT.
HE TOLD ME.

25:59.480 --> 26:00.469
HE'S VERY PROUD OF YOU,
YOU KNOW.

26:00.590 --> 26:01.488
HE THINKS YOU'RE VERY SMART.

26:01.590 --> 26:02.682
- I GUESS.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.791
- HE BRAGS ABOUT YOU A LOT.
- YEAH.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.460
- YOU KNOW, YOUR DAD, LIKE,
MOSTLY, SINCE I'VE KNOWN HIM,

26:07.560 --> 26:09.073
HE SEEMS MAINLY
A LITTLE BIT MOPEY TO ME.

26:09.180 --> 26:11.626
THE MOST EXCITED
I EVER SEE HIM GET

26:11.740 --> 26:12.661
IS WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT YOU.

26:12.770 --> 26:14.772
HE GETS REALLY EXCITED.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.804
- HMM.
[phone dings]

26:19.920 --> 26:23.504
- MM-HMM.

26:23.610 --> 26:24.645
- ANYTHING EXCITING GOING ON?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.058
- AUBREY PETERSON IS, LIKE,

26:26.170 --> 26:28.161
THE MOST POPULAR GIRL
IN SCHOOL.

26:28.270 --> 26:29.578
- MM.

26:29.690 --> 26:31.646
- AND SHE'S HOSTING
A CO-ED POOL PARTY.

26:31.760 --> 26:32.897
- OH.
- I'VE NEVER EXACTLY BEEN

26:33.000 --> 26:34.797
INVITED TO ONE
OF HER PARTIES BEFORE.

26:34.900 --> 26:36.788
AND IT'S TODAY, SO...

26:36.900 --> 26:37.798
- AH.
- I CAN'T MAKE IT.

26:37.900 --> 26:38.969
- OH, MAN.
- YEP.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.308
- YEP.

26:40.420 --> 26:42.388
- AND MY FRIENDS, THEY ALL KEEP
TEXTING ME ABOUT IT,

26:42.490 --> 26:43.525
AND IT'S COMPLETELY EPIC,

26:43.630 --> 26:45.552
AND IT JUST SUCKS
NOT BEING THERE.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.285
- GOD.
_ 50--

26:47.390 --> 26:48.527
- YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

26:48.640 --> 26:50.016
- YOU THINK
I'M BEING SHALLOW?

26:50.120 --> 26:50.939
- OH, MY GOD, NO.

26:51.050 --> 26:52.529
IT'S AN EPIC CO-ED POOL PARTY.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.369
I TO--I UNDERSTAND.

26:54.470 --> 26:57.701
I BET IT'S REALLY HARD WHEN YOU
HAVE TO TRANSITION UP HERE,

26:57.820 --> 26:59.845
DROP EVERYTHING IN LA.
ONCE A MONTH.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.541
IT'S JUST GOTTA BE TOUGH.

27:01.650 --> 27:03.129
AND YOUR DAD THINKS
ABOUT IT TOO, YOU KNOW.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.265
HE KNOWS, AND THAT'S WHY
HE TRIES TO PLAN

27:05.380 --> 27:06.961
THESE BIG, EXCITING WEEKENDS,

27:07.070 --> 27:08.958
OR WHAT HE THINKS
IS EXCITING.

27:09.070 --> 27:10.105
[snickers]

27:10.210 --> 27:12.246
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

27:12.350 --> 27:14.830
- BUT IT'S LIKE, MY FRIENDS,
THEY TEXT ME ABOUT IT,

27:14.940 --> 27:16.828
AND THEY ASK
WHAT I'M UP TO,

27:16.940 --> 27:18.999
AND IT'S LIKE, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO TEXT BACK?

27:19.120 --> 27:21.691
THAT I'M AT THE AQUARIUM
PLAYING WITH SEA OTTERS?

27:21.810 --> 27:23.528
- NO. MM-MM.
- NO.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.119
- TELL THEM
YOU'RE AT A PHOTO SHOOT.

27:25.220 --> 27:29.702
OKAY? YOU'RE AT A PHOTO SHOOT
WITH JUSTIN BIEBER.

27:29.820 --> 27:31.151
- [scoffs]

27:31.270 --> 27:32.157
[laughs]

27:32.270 --> 27:35.717
- [snickers]

27:35.820 --> 27:38.857
- WAIT, SERIOUSLY?

27:38.960 --> 27:40.928
- [laughs]
- THAT'S AWESOME. THANKS!

27:41.030 --> 27:42.236
- SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU

27:42.350 --> 27:43.999
ABOUT THAT WORD YOU HEARD
AT THE STUDIO.

27:44.110 --> 27:46.271
I KNOW YOU HAVE
SOME QUESTIONS.

27:46.380 --> 27:49.349
- WELL, DADDY SAID BLACK PEOPLE
SOMETIMES SAY IT,

27:49.460 --> 27:51.382
BUT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO.

27:51.490 --> 27:52.627
- YEAH.

27:52.740 --> 27:54.355
I KNOW IT'S
REALLY CONFUSING,

27:54.460 --> 27:55.870
SO LET'S BACK UP.

27:55.980 --> 27:59.108
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHERE THAT WORD COMES FROM.

27:59.220 --> 28:02.872
THAT WORD COMES
FROM THE WORD "NIGGER."

28:02.990 --> 28:06.642
IT'S A VERY MEAN WORD
THAT WHITE PEOPLE USE

28:06.750 --> 28:07.978
TO CALL BLACK PEOPLE,

28:08.100 --> 28:11.160
AND IT MEANS
THAT WE'RE NOT AS GOOD

28:11.270 --> 28:14.569
OR AS SMART OR AS HUMAN
AS THEM.

28:14.690 --> 28:16.476
- WHY WOULD PEOPLE SAY THAT?

28:16.590 --> 28:20.936
- THE CLOUDS ARE CREEPING

28:21.040 --> 28:24.794
- WELL, A REALLY,
REALLY LONG TIME AGO,

28:24.910 --> 28:29.188
WHITE PEOPLE OWNED
BLACK PEOPLE AS SLAVES.

28:29.290 --> 28:31.383
AND WE'VE COME
A LONG, LONG WAY.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.389
YOU KNOW HOW WE CELEBRATE
MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY?

28:34.500 --> 28:35.728
- MM-HMM.

28:35.850 --> 28:38.398
- WELL, HE HELPED
TO MAKE THINGS EQUAL.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.263
AND LEGALLY THEY ARE,

28:40.370 --> 28:44.500
BUT SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE THEY ARE.

28:44.610 --> 28:47.090
SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS YET?

28:47.200 --> 28:49.236
- CAN PEOPLE CALL ME
THAT WORD?

28:49.340 --> 28:51.786
- THEY BETTER NOT.

28:51.900 --> 28:55.518
- THEY MIGHT.

28:55.630 --> 28:57.177
I REMEMBER I WAS YOUR AGE

28:57.280 --> 29:00.795
WHEN MY MOM TALKED TO ME
ABOUT ALL THIS.

29:00.910 --> 29:03.117
AND IT WAS REALLY COMFORTING

29:03.220 --> 29:05.836
WHEN SHE SAID
THAT THE WORLD WAS BETTER

29:05.950 --> 29:07.087
THAN WHEN SHE WAS
A LITTLE GIRL.

29:07.190 --> 29:08.703
AND NOW I'M SITTING HERE
WITH YOU,

29:08.810 --> 29:09.799
HAVING THE SAME TALK.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.706
AND IT'S EVEN BETTER.

29:11.810 --> 29:13.050
YOU KNOW,
MY MOM USED TO DREAM

29:13.160 --> 29:15.845
ABOUT THE DAY WHEN WE WOULD HAVE
A BLACK PRESIDENT.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.461
- AND NOW WE DO. OBAMA.

29:17.580 --> 29:18.672
- THAT'S RIGHT.

29:18.790 --> 29:22.851
WE LIVE
IN PRETTY GOOD TIMES NOW.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.587
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY

29:24.690 --> 29:25.964
OR BE SCARED
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

29:26.070 --> 29:31.315
- I'M STILL NOT HERE

29:31.420 --> 29:35.834
MM, MM, MM, MM

29:35.940 --> 29:39.182
- CROSBY, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO ADD?

29:39.290 --> 29:43.806
- NO, THAT--
THAT WAS PERFECT.

29:43.920 --> 29:44.807
- OKAY, SO YOU KNOW
WHERE THAT WORD COMES FROM.

29:44.920 --> 29:48.606
[music crescendos]

30:06.280 --> 30:08.032
- HEY.

30:08.150 --> 30:09.868
- HEY.

30:09.980 --> 30:12.141
- YOU OKAY?

30:12.250 --> 30:14.218
- YEAH.
JUST THINKING WHAT A...

30:14.320 --> 30:17.187
GOOD JOB YOU DID
WITH HIM LAST NIGHT.

30:17.290 --> 30:18.461
- HEH!

30:18.570 --> 30:20.014
- YOU WERE REALLY AMAZING.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.054
YOU WERE RIGHT TO HANDLE IT.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.264
- THANKS.

30:24.370 --> 30:26.019
I THINK HE UNDERSTOOD
MOST OF IT.

30:26.130 --> 30:28.473
- OH, HE TOTALLY
UNDERSTOOD IT.

30:28.580 --> 30:29.740
I MEAN, EVEN I UNDERSTOOD IT

30:29.860 --> 30:33.967
IN A WAY
I NEVER REALLY HAD.

30:34.070 --> 30:37.927
I WAS WATCHING YOU TWO,
LIKE THE CONNECTION, AND...

30:38.040 --> 30:40.349
FELT A LITTLE IRRELEVANT.

30:40.450 --> 30:42.452
- NO, I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE THAT.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.313
- NO, NO, NOT--NO, NO,
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

30:45.420 --> 30:49.459
I JUST, YOU KNOW, I HATE
THINKING THAT THERE'S

30:49.570 --> 30:52.016
THINGS HE'S GONNA EXPERIENCE
THAT I JUST--

30:52.120 --> 30:53.917
I CAN'T RELATE.
YOU'RE RIGHT, I CAN'T.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.329
YOU KNOW.
- YEAH.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.816
BUT THERE'S GONNA BE
OTHER TIMES

30:57.920 --> 31:00.081
WHEN YOU CAN RELATE
AND I CAN'T.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.191
HE'S A BOY, SO HE'S GONNA
GO THROUGH

31:02.300 --> 31:05.781
ALL SORTS OF THINGS
THAT I WON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:05.890 --> 31:08.711
NOR DO I WANT TO.
[chuckles]

31:08.830 --> 31:11.993
- YEAH, I THINK
IT'S DIFFERENT, THOUGH.

31:16.390 --> 31:19.006
HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED
TO YOU?

31:19.110 --> 31:22.420
YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU WERE
MADE TO FEEL LESS THAN?

31:25.220 --> 31:28.348
- YEAH, A FEW TIMES.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.462
I'M SORRY.

31:37.170 --> 31:43.712
- WE'RE STILL FAR

31:43.830 --> 31:45.616
- IF THAT EVER HAPPENED
TO HIM,

31:45.730 --> 31:47.618
IT WOULD KILL ME.

31:48.660 --> 31:55.077
- STILL FAR

31:57.080 --> 31:58.286
- LOOKS REALLY REAL, TOO.

31:58.390 --> 31:59.630
HEY, CAN YOU PUT
HIS ARM AROUND ME?

31:59.740 --> 32:00.775
- NO, HE'S NOT...
- NO?

32:00.880 --> 32:02.017
- PUTTING HIS
BIEBER PAWS...

32:02.120 --> 32:03.462
- JUST CASUAL,
LIKE THEIR FRIENDS.

32:03.570 --> 32:05.083
- YEAH, JUST CASUAL.
- NO, THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.078
- IT'S HARMLESS, COME ON.
- RIGHT THERE.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.020
WE'RE GONNA JUST KEEP IT
JUST LIKE THIS.

32:09.130 --> 32:10.882
HE'S GOT THAT DISTANT LOOK.

32:10.990 --> 32:13.231
- OKAY.
- YEAH, FREAK OUT.

32:13.340 --> 32:14.853
- OH, HEY, CAN YOU
SHORTEN MY SKIRT?

32:14.960 --> 32:17.474
both: NO!

32:17.590 --> 32:19.729
- NO.
- [laughs]

32:19.830 --> 32:21.582
THAT WOULD BE COOL, THOUGH.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.066
THIS IS SO COOL.

32:25.630 --> 32:28.929
- WHAT YOU DOING?
- NOT PLAYING BASEBALL.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.183
- YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:32.290 --> 32:34.212
- NOPE.

32:36.540 --> 32:38.462
- OKAY, I'M GONNA TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

32:38.570 --> 32:40.947
AND YOU CAN LISTEN.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.745
I NEED YOU TO
SHUT THAT DOWN.

32:43.850 --> 32:45.989
- [exhales]

32:48.410 --> 32:49.957
- I WAS INCREDIBLY PROUD
OF YOU.

32:50.070 --> 32:51.207
- NO, YOU WEREN'T.

32:51.310 --> 32:53.164
I STRUCK OUT
AND I THREW A BAT.

32:53.280 --> 32:55.236
- WELL, I DIDN'T LOVE
THE THROWING THE BAT PART,

32:55.350 --> 32:57.068
OR THE YELLING
AT THE COACH PART,

32:57.180 --> 32:58.966
BUT RIGHT UP UNTIL THEN,

32:59.080 --> 33:00.524
YOU WENT OUT THERE
AND YOU TRIED SOMETHING

33:00.630 --> 33:02.006
YOU NEVER DONE BEFORE

33:02.110 --> 33:05.045
WITH A BUNCH OF KIDS
YOU NEVER MET.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.185
THAT'S BRAVE.

33:06.290 --> 33:08.019
THAT'S SO INCREDIBLY BRAVE.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.283
ARE YOU SCARED?

33:14.160 --> 33:17.573
I'D HAVE BEEN.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.883
YOU KNOW, BUDDY, I GET
SO EXCITED

33:20.990 --> 33:22.230
ABOUT YOU BEING A PART
OF THIS FAMILY

33:22.340 --> 33:25.138
THAT...I JUST--
I FORGET,

33:25.240 --> 33:27.344
YOU KNOW, THAT EVERYTHING
IS SO NEW.

33:27.450 --> 33:29.725
AND I GUESS I FORGOT
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

33:29.830 --> 33:32.139
TO BE THE NEW KID.

33:32.250 --> 33:36.789
I'M STILL FIGURING THIS OUT.

33:36.910 --> 33:39.219
HOW TO BE YOUR DAD.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.948
BUT I LOVE BASEBALL, AND I,
FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,

33:42.050 --> 33:46.293
I THINK YOU'D...
REALLY LIKE IT TOO.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.297
I'M NOT GONNA FORCE YOU
TO DO

33:50.400 --> 33:52.914
ANYTHING YOU DON'T
WANNA DO.

33:53.030 --> 33:55.055
I'M NOT GONNA FORCE YOU
TO GO BACK.

33:55.170 --> 33:57.024
BUT IF YOU TAKE SOME TIME,
YOU DECIDE

33:57.130 --> 33:59.690
IT'S SOMETHING
YOU'D LIKE TO DO,

33:59.790 --> 34:01.064
THEN YOU JUST COME TELL ME,

34:01.170 --> 34:04.890
BECAUSE I'D LIKE
TO HELP YOU WITH IT, OKAY?

34:05.000 --> 34:09.209
- OKAY.

34:12.110 --> 34:14.249
- OKAY.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.882
- HEY, PAL, WHAT'S UP?

34:30.990 --> 34:33.402
- MOM SAID I COULD RUN.

34:33.510 --> 34:35.478
- UH, LISTEN, MAX, WE'RE
GONNA TALK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

34:35.590 --> 34:37.785
- SHE ALREADY SAID
I COULD RUN,

34:37.900 --> 34:39.959
SO I'M RUNNING.

34:40.070 --> 34:41.173
- I NEED TO TALK
TO YOUR MOTHER, OKAY?

34:41.280 --> 34:44.579
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

34:44.700 --> 34:47.555
- I'M RUNNING.

34:47.670 --> 34:51.117
- AND PIGGY SAYS, "OINK OINK
OINK OINK OINK OINK OINK."

34:51.220 --> 34:52.448
[kissing noises]

34:52.570 --> 34:56.017
MOMMY LOVES HER GIRL.
HER GIRL.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.748
- KRISTINA?
HEY, SO, HONEY--

34:58.850 --> 34:59.987
- ADAM--
- WE SAID WE WOULD

35:00.090 --> 35:01.193
DISCUSS THIS.
- I KNOW THAT WE DID.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.473
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS FAIR TO MAX, OKAY?

35:03.580 --> 35:04.604
- UH-HUH? WELL, THANKS
FOR INCLUDING ME.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.164
- I'M SORRY.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.646
LOOK, I JUST THINK THAT THIS
WILL BE A GREAT THING.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.261
I THINK THAT I CAN HELP HIM
WRITE HIS SPEECH.

35:09.380 --> 35:11.029
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
MAKING THE POSTERS

35:11.140 --> 35:12.277
WILL BE A GREAT DISTRACT ION
FOR ME--

35:12.380 --> 35:13.608
- I WANT YOU TO MOVE
THE SURGERY

35:13.730 --> 35:15.891
BACK TO WHERE IT WAS.

35:16.010 --> 35:17.693
- [sighs]

35:17.800 --> 35:19.142
- I KNOW YOU WANT TO
CONTROL ALL THIS.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.763
I KNOW DR. BEDSLOE SAID
THAT YOU COULD

35:20.870 --> 35:23.043
WAIT UNTIL THE 12TH, BUT I WANT
THIS THING OUT OF YOU.

35:23.150 --> 35:25.380
I DON'T WANT TO WAIT.
I'M SCARED TO WAIT.

35:27.840 --> 35:29.774
- I'M SORRY.

35:32.540 --> 35:35.008
I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR DOING THIS TO YOU.

35:35.130 --> 35:36.529
- NO, HONEY, HONEY,
DON'T EVER SAY THAT.

35:36.650 --> 35:38.197
DON'T EVER SAY THAT.
I JUST WANT THIS OUT.

35:38.300 --> 35:41.474
I JUST WANT TO ATTACK THIS
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

35:41.580 --> 35:44.447
- I DO TOO.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.412
- OKAY, I'LL CON--
I CALL DR. BEDSLOE'S OFFICE

35:50.520 --> 35:53.523
AND MOVE THE SURGERY DATE BACK.

35:53.630 --> 35:55.598
- YEAH.

35:58.630 --> 36:01.349
NORA.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.155
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

36:03.260 --> 36:04.568
WHAT'S IN YOUR BOTTLE?
YOU HAVING SOME MILK.

36:04.670 --> 36:05.773
YOU ARE A SNACKER.

36:10.340 --> 36:11.648
[sprinklers hissing]

36:11.750 --> 36:12.978
- DO YOU HEAR THAT?
IT GOING "CHOO CHOO CHOO."

36:13.100 --> 36:14.818
- YEAH, NO, I HEAR IT,
YEAH.

36:14.930 --> 36:16.329
- YOU DO?
- YEAH.

36:16.450 --> 36:17.781
- SEE, I KNEW IT.
THAT'S AIR IN THE LINES, RIGHT?

36:17.890 --> 36:18.993
- SOUNDS LIKE WATER HAMMER.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.239
- WAS YOUR WATER
SHUT OFF RECENTLY?

36:21.350 --> 36:22.965
- YEAH, WELL, I SHUT IT OFF

36:23.070 --> 36:24.583
WHEN I RE-DID THE TOILET
DOWNSTAIRS.

36:24.690 --> 36:26.078
- THAT'LL DO IT.
WHEN YOU SHUT IT OFF,

36:26.180 --> 36:27.340
IT CREATES A BUILDUP.

36:27.460 --> 36:28.597
AND I CAN PROBABLY JUST
ADJUST, YOU KNOW,

36:28.700 --> 36:31.146
THE PRESSURE
AT THE CONTROL BOX.

36:31.250 --> 36:33.138
- REALLY? WELL, THAT'S
IN THE BARN.

36:33.260 --> 36:35.046
- GREAT.
- I GOTTA TELL YOU, KID,

36:35.150 --> 36:36.777
YOU ARE A GENIUS.
- I DON'T KNOW--

36:36.880 --> 36:38.461
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS
HAPPENING AT THE V.A.,

36:38.570 --> 36:40.629
BUT THEY SHOULD BE STANDING
IN LINE T0 HIRE YOU.

36:40.750 --> 36:43.082
- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

36:43.200 --> 36:46.909
I MEAN, BEING BACK'S BEEN...
KIND OF WEIRD.

36:47.030 --> 36:50.545
- WELL, IT TAKES A WHILE
TO FEEL NORMAL AGAIN.

36:50.650 --> 36:52.572
- HOW LONG?

36:52.690 --> 36:55.204
- HOW LONG?

36:55.310 --> 36:59.246
HECK, I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.102
- I JUST FEEL LIKE I COULD
HANDLE IT BETTER

37:01.210 --> 37:04.384
IF I KNEW IT WASN'T
GONNA BE FOREVER.

37:07.080 --> 37:08.661
- WELL, I KNOW THAT, UH,

37:08.770 --> 37:10.738
WHEN I WENT TO VIETNAM,
I WAS A KID.

37:10.840 --> 37:15.083
AND WHEN I GOT BACK, I DIDN'T
KNOW WHO THE HELL I WAS.

37:15.190 --> 37:16.748
I SURE AS HELL
WASN'T NORMAL,

37:16.850 --> 37:18.704
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

37:18.820 --> 37:22.404
- THAT'S WHAT SCARING
THE HELL OUT OF ME.

37:22.510 --> 37:25.377
- BUT YOU GIVE IT TIME,
AND YOU BECOME

37:25.480 --> 37:28.540
SOMETHING DIFFERENT,
SOMETHING NEW, YOU KNOW?

37:28.660 --> 37:31.345
I THINK MAYBE IT STARTED
FOR ME WHEN I GOT BACK.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.203
YOU KNOW, AT THE AIRPORT,
THERE WAS ALL THESE PROTESTORS

37:34.320 --> 37:36.345
AND SIGNS OF A LOT OF HATE.

37:36.460 --> 37:40.282
I NEVER FORGOT THAT, SO...

37:40.390 --> 37:43.041
YOU GUYS CAME BACK,
AND IT'S DIFFERENT.

37:43.150 --> 37:44.594
PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF YOU.

37:44.710 --> 37:47.087
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
I MEAN...

37:47.190 --> 37:48.532
AT LEAST PEOPLE SAW YOU.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.915
AT LEAST PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT YOU WERE

37:51.020 --> 37:52.123
A PART OF THIS THING,

37:52.230 --> 37:54.573
THIS--THIS
LIFE-ALTERING THING.

37:54.680 --> 37:57.649
AND FOR US I JUST FEEL
LIKE SOMETIMES...

37:57.750 --> 37:59.923
WE'RE INVISIBLE.

38:00.030 --> 38:03.409
- YOU'RE NOT INVISIBLE TO ME.

38:12.800 --> 38:13.835
- SMILE.
[camera shutter clicking]

38:13.940 --> 38:16.147
- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO
LIGHT IT LOWER

38:16.250 --> 38:17.592
SHE'S GONNA BE SHORTER
THAN ME.

38:17.700 --> 38:19.634
- MRS. FRANKLIN IS ALSO
NOT AS ITALIAN AS YOU.

38:19.740 --> 38:22.459
SHE'S QUITE PALE, SO I'M
GOING TO LIGHT ACCORDINGLY.

38:22.570 --> 38:24.367
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU HAVE TO
BRING RACE INTO IT...

38:24.470 --> 38:26.085
- [laughing] 'CAUSE
SHE'S NOT DARK LIKE YOU.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.644
[cell phone chimes]
- HOLD ON.

38:27.750 --> 38:29.809
- SHE'S PALE.
I THINK THAT'S NICE, THOUGH.

38:29.920 --> 38:33.378
- AH. IT'S RUBY.

38:33.480 --> 38:35.516
APPARENTLY, I'M AWESOME.
- [chuckles]

38:35.620 --> 38:37.656
WELL, AT LEAST ONE PERSON
THINKS SO.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.967
LISTEN, I REALLY WANT TO
BE A GOOD ASSISTANT TODAY,

38:40.070 --> 38:41.480
SO LET'S PRACTICE.

38:41.590 --> 38:42.932
ALL RIGHT, TELL ME
WHAT TO DO AND I'LL DO IT.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.177
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE NEED
A WARMING GEL FOR THIS.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.656
- OKAY.

38:45.770 --> 38:46.725
- FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

38:46.840 --> 38:48.239
- OF COURSE,
I KNOW WHAT IT IS,

38:48.360 --> 38:50.169
I KNOW WHERE IT IS,
AND I EVEN SORT OF KNOW

38:50.290 --> 38:51.496
HOW TO USE IT.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.976
- I'LL BELIEVE THAT
WHEN I SEE IT.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.968
HOW DO YOU SPELL "BIEBER?"

38:55.090 --> 38:56.489
_ III-E."

39:00.950 --> 39:02.269
WHAT IS THIS?

39:02.370 --> 39:04.474
- YEAH, THAT'S--THE GELS
ARE IN THE OTHER DRAWER.

39:04.580 --> 39:07.265
BEHIND YOU.
THEY'RE NOT IN THAT DRAWER.

39:07.370 --> 39:08.610
- THIS YOURS?

39:08.720 --> 39:12.304
- YEAH, WHAT'S--
WHAT GAVE THAT AWAY?

39:12.410 --> 39:13.616
MY NAME IN THE CORNER?

39:13.730 --> 39:15.300
- HANK, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.751
IF YOU CAN DO THIS,
WHY ARE WE SHOOTING

39:16.870 --> 39:18.758
MRS. FRANKLIN
AND SEA OTTERS?

39:18.870 --> 39:20.838
- YEAH, THAT WAS
A LIFETIME AGO.

39:20.940 --> 39:23.215
I HAVEN'T DONE STUFF LIKE
THAT IN ABOUT A DECADE.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.562
- DID YOU STOP
WHEN RUBY WAS BORN?

39:26.670 --> 39:27.978
- YOU DID THE MATH THERE.
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.594
- YEAH, SEE THAT?
I CAN COUNT ALL THE WAY TO TEN.

39:30.710 --> 39:33.429
- YES.
YEAH, I DID.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.429
- SETH SAID HE WOULD STOP
TOURING WHEN AMBER WAS BORN,

39:36.540 --> 39:39.259
BUT...HE DIDN'T.

39:39.370 --> 39:41.713
- WELL, IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO BE A GOOD DAD

39:41.820 --> 39:44.880
WHEN YOU'RE CHASING STORIES
ALL OVER THE WORLD, SO...

39:45.000 --> 39:47.400
- SERIOUSLY, WE SHOULD HANG
SOME OF THESE.

39:52.250 --> 39:55.413
HUH?

39:55.530 --> 39:58.761
- THEY'RE KIND OF HARD
FOR ME TO LOOK AT.

40:02.670 --> 40:04.183
- THE GELS.
YOU GONNA IMPRESS ME OR NOT.

40:04.290 --> 40:05.917
COME ON.

40:06.020 --> 40:10.320
- THOUGH MY SHOES
ARE NOT FOR WINTER...

40:13.440 --> 40:15.021
- HEY, HEY, D.

40:15.130 --> 40:16.711
- ZEEK!
- YEAH.

40:16.820 --> 40:18.299
- DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE
YOU HERE AGAIN.

40:18.410 --> 40:20.685
YOUR WIFE SEND_YOU BACK?
[all chuckling]

40:20.790 --> 40:23.350
- OH, YEAH, WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S REAL FUNNY.

40:23.450 --> 40:27.580
NO, LISTEN, UM, IF YOU NEED
SOMEBODY TO MAKE THE COFFEE

40:27.700 --> 40:30.794
AND ARRANGE THE COOKIES,
THEN I'M YOUR MAN.

40:30.910 --> 40:35.449
BUT LISTEN, HEY, D,
I THINK...

40:35.570 --> 40:38.141
I THINK I GOT
A LOT MORE TO OFFER.

40:40.290 --> 40:43.703
- WELL, DEAL THE CARDS.

40:43.820 --> 40:44.912
- RIGHT.

40:45.020 --> 40:49.093
- THE PIANO
HAS BEEN WAITING

40:49.200 --> 40:53.512
FOR SOME LONELY MAN
TO PLAY A NOTE...

40:53.620 --> 40:55.997
- HEY.
- HEY.

40:56.100 --> 40:59.615
- UM, YOU WANT TO HAVE
A GAME OF CATCH?

41:02.210 --> 41:08.809
- PUT YOUR HAND
WHERE YOU CAN FEEL ME...

41:08.910 --> 41:12.016
- NOW WHEN YOU THROW IT,
JUST STEP IN A LITTLE BIT

41:12.120 --> 41:13.940
WITH YOUR OTHER FOOT.

41:14.050 --> 41:16.018
HEY, GOOD!

41:19.090 --> 41:20.261
OH, NICE!

41:27.890 --> 41:31.132
ALL RIGHT, POP FLY.
GOOD, BUDDY.

41:31.240 --> 41:33.652
GROUND BALL.
NICE.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.625
- SO WE NEED TO MAKE
BUTTONS AND STICKERS.

41:35.730 --> 41:38.528
AND WE NEED TO FINISH
THESE POSTERS UP,

41:38.630 --> 41:40.177
AND ALSO YOU NEED TO
MAKE CUPCAKES

41:40.290 --> 41:41.382
WITH MY NAME IN FROSTING.

41:41.490 --> 41:42.730
- I THINK I'M GONNA LET
THE BAKERY

41:42.840 --> 41:43.761
HANDLE THE CUPCAKES.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.074
- WHY? I LIKE YOUR CUPCAKES.

41:45.190 --> 41:46.521
- I KNOW, BUT I JUST THINK
THAT WE HAVE

41:46.640 --> 41:47.777
A LOT ON OUR PLATE,
SO WE'RE GONNA--

41:47.880 --> 41:49.495
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
"A LOT ON OUR PLATE?"

41:49.610 --> 41:50.531
- IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE A LOT
TO GET FINISHED.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.187
WE STILL HAVE
ALL THESE POSTERS TO DO.

41:52.300 --> 41:53.437
WE HAVE TO WRITE YOUR SPEECH.

41:53.540 --> 41:54.575
- THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH PLATES.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.159
- [chuckles]
OKAY.

41:56.270 --> 41:58.409
- WELL, EVEN THOUGH YOU
COULDN'T GET BOB LITTLE ELECTED,

41:58.510 --> 42:02.571
YOU'RE STILL AN OKAY
CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

42:02.690 --> 42:06.478
- THANK YOU, MAX.

42:06.590 --> 42:13.348
- UNDERSTAND

42:13.460 --> 42:15.178
- ALL RIGHT, HOW CAN I HELP?

42:15.290 --> 42:16.484
- WELL...

42:16.600 --> 42:17.692
- LET'S GET
THIS CAMPAIGN MOVING.

42:17.810 --> 42:19.209
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS ONE?

42:19.320 --> 42:21.424
"MAX IS THE BRAVER MAN!"

42:21.530 --> 42:23.771
- I LIKE THAT.
"BRAVER" COULD BE BIGGER.
