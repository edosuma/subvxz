00:12.253 --> 00:14.758
Okay, explain that to me again.

00:14.858 --> 00:17.763
- I think...
- You think your necklace is magic?

00:17.864 --> 00:18.945
...ish.

00:19.066 --> 00:21.728
You didn't see it,
what I did to those guys.

00:21.838 --> 00:23.642
What I could do.

00:24.577 --> 00:26.621
- You think I'm crazy?
- I don't think you're crazy.

00:26.660 --> 00:30.199
I think the idea that your necklace
is magic might a little bit crazy.

00:30.299 --> 00:32.359
I know, but what if it's not?

00:32.459 --> 00:35.365
Before coming back to Detroit,
I spent some time in Central City.

00:35.465 --> 00:38.338
- I know where you going with this...
- And believe me when I tell you,

00:38.438 --> 00:40.885
that "crazy" just might be
the new normal.

00:42.045 --> 00:43.949
Sweetie, what are you doing?

00:52.332 --> 00:55.871
Think that guy hit me in the head
a little harder than I thought.

01:00.648 --> 01:02.118
Four years, you've been gone.

01:02.218 --> 01:05.491
Please tell me you didn't come home
just to jump off the roof of my house.

01:05.592 --> 01:07.284
You saw what I did to the table.

01:07.384 --> 01:09.399
I really need to start drinking
right now.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.677
Chuck, are you seeing this?

01:15.795 --> 01:19.774
Yeah, and I'm here to tell you that
seeing is definitely not believing.

01:20.487 --> 01:21.689
Geez!

01:22.458 --> 01:24.799
Mari, whatever
you're thinking about doing,

01:24.900 --> 01:27.118
how about you don't do it?

01:43.223 --> 01:46.315
___

01:49.110 --> 01:51.114
You are so not gonna believe this.

01:51.214 --> 01:54.354
You know the facial recognition
algorithm Felicity hooked us up with?

01:54.454 --> 01:57.968
I modified it to flag any activity
that could be meta-human.

01:59.130 --> 02:00.564
Are you listening to me?

02:00.666 --> 02:02.830
Sorry, I had a USB drive
containing crime scenes stats,

02:02.870 --> 02:05.451
but I can't find it at the station,
so I'm praying that it might be here.

02:05.552 --> 02:09.183
- Which is not.
- Barry, focus. Meta-human.

02:09.317 --> 02:11.822
I'm am so dead.
Captain Singh is going to kill me.

02:11.922 --> 02:13.260
Just look at this.

02:13.558 --> 02:16.397
Our very first external
meta-human sighting.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.767
I'm calling her... Vixen.

02:19.871 --> 02:22.509
Because what? She moves like a fox?

02:22.609 --> 02:25.615
Because she is a fox.
Check out that hotness.

02:25.715 --> 02:27.854
Wait, where in Central City is this?

02:27.954 --> 02:30.258
That would be the less cool part.

02:30.459 --> 02:32.463
Detroit.
I know, I know...

02:32.563 --> 02:35.602
Coast City or the Bahamas -
that would be better, but...

02:35.702 --> 02:37.784
You're still gonna
check this out, right?

02:40.211 --> 02:41.346
Not alone.

02:41.446 --> 02:44.352
A meta-human outside Central City
could be something...

02:44.452 --> 02:45.722
more.

02:45.822 --> 02:47.090
I should bring backup.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.361
Finally.

02:48.461 --> 02:50.498
I've been dying
to get back on the field.

02:50.598 --> 02:52.334
Not you, Cisco.

02:54.907 --> 02:56.844
Could you at least
bring me back her...

02:57.278 --> 02:58.646
And he is gone.

03:03.289 --> 03:04.993
You know what this could mean for me?

03:05.093 --> 03:06.347
A mask and a cape?

03:06.563 --> 03:09.134
- My whole life there's been...
- Something missing.

03:09.401 --> 03:11.639
This necklace could change all that.

03:12.041 --> 03:13.213
I don't know how...

03:13.313 --> 03:15.245
And I know it sounds crazy, but...

03:15.714 --> 03:17.696
what if
the most amazing thing it can do

03:17.796 --> 03:20.282
is lead me to some answers?

03:21.091 --> 03:24.097
To find out, finally find out,

03:24.198 --> 03:25.955
who I am.

03:26.502 --> 03:27.615
I'll get it.

03:27.736 --> 03:30.410
Probably the Magical Necklace
Collection Agency.

03:35.553 --> 03:37.264
<i>Who's at the door?</i>

03:38.613 --> 03:41.346
People to see you, I'm pretty sure.

03:42.634 --> 03:43.836
Mari McCabe?

03:47.310 --> 03:50.244
- She moves fast.
- Compared to who?
