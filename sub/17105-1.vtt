00:55.806 --> 00:58.224
I watched Signs again last night.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.394
It keeps getting better
every time I see it.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.105
It's funny.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.735
The first time you watch it,
it's hard to understand what it's about.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.987
It just sort of meanders.

01:12.072 --> 01:17.076
And then, everything comes together
in this one perfect moment at the end.

01:17.995 --> 01:21.497
And when you watch it a second
or a third or a fourth time,

01:21.665 --> 01:26.085
you start to see that
all of this randomness

01:27.171 --> 01:29.881
is leading towards a perfect moment.

01:31.842 --> 01:35.178
My favorite character is the little girl.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.015
Everyone thinks she's so strange

01:39.850 --> 01:42.685
because she can't finish
a glass of water.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.813
She's convinced they're contaminated.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.650
So, by the end of the film,

01:49.860 --> 01:53.321
there are glasses of water
littered around this house.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.202
And then, it's the water that saves them.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.456
And that was fate.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.882
I can't help but wonder about my fate.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.052
About my destiny.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.176
Renewal.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.179
Vitality.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.890
Energy.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.145
Are you tired of feeling sluggish?

04:31.396 --> 04:34.148
Do you feel like life is passing you by?

04:35.442 --> 04:37.610
Then we've got the solution for you.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.697
It's called "The Most Incredible Vitamin
In The World"

04:42.032 --> 04:45.368
and there's a reason you're watching
this right now.

04:46.703 --> 04:50.957
Just pick up the phone
and start the new chapter to your life.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.420
Call now. Not available in stores.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.465
Made in Germany.
Beware of imitators. Call 1-800...

05:02.344 --> 05:04.428
Hello?

05:04.513 --> 05:05.846
Yo, Kevin.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.182
No, this is Jeff.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.809
Where Kevin at?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.185
I don't know.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.687
Oh, man, look, don't be fucking around!

05:12.771 --> 05:13.896
Where the fuck is Kevin?

05:15.107 --> 05:16.399
Kevin doesn't live here.

05:16.483 --> 05:20.111
There's always some motherfucker
trying to tell me there ain't no Kevin!

05:20.195 --> 05:24.365
Let me put this word in your fucking
peanut brain, Kevin! K-E-V-I-N!

05:40.007 --> 05:41.340
Kevin.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.307
What are you doing?

05:50.392 --> 05:51.600
Doing this.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.936
Some strawbs,

05:54.021 --> 05:55.187
hand-sliced.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.360
A white rose of whipped cream. Bam!

06:06.241 --> 06:07.283
Bon appÃ©tit.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.827
What's the special occasion?

06:09.911 --> 06:13.497
This is one of those
"just because" breakfasts, you know?

06:13.582 --> 06:15.916
It sounds corny,
but relationships are like flowers

06:16.001 --> 06:19.003
and flowers need water to bloom.

06:19.087 --> 06:24.050
Consider this sprinkling
from a watering can.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.469
Well, thanks.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.971
- That's nice.
- You're welcome. Enjoy.

06:31.349 --> 06:35.019
Oh, my gosh.
I got some good news, actually.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.270
Yeah?

06:36.354 --> 06:38.397
I got a phone call from Randy.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.150
Is he the guy
that we talked to at that barbecue?

06:41.234 --> 06:43.694
Oh, no, that's a different Randy.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.072
- But that guy's name was Randy, right?
- Yes.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.323
I liked his wife.

06:47.616 --> 06:48.908
Different Randy.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.826
- We should have them over.
- Yeah.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.662
This is Randy at Millennium Porsche.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.332
Can I tell you something?

06:56.416 --> 07:00.127
With no money down,
this thing is practically free.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.378
Pat! No!

07:01.463 --> 07:03.798
Whoa, whoa. Don't start with no.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.634
- That's what this is.
- Don't start with no.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.719
You're just, like, in this mindset.
And you're not even...

07:08.804 --> 07:10.930
It's not a mindset.
We don't have the money.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.516
Yeah.
That's the mindset I'm talking about.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.018
Honey, look, I'm trying
to be really careful,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.270
and I've cut back on some things.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.606
And, like, we promised
we were going to get a house this year...

07:20.690 --> 07:22.316
I'm just trying
to be a grown-up about this.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.360
Surprise.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.824
We got it.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.869
This is happening.

07:35.622 --> 07:40.167
Look... Everything you just
said about the house,

07:40.252 --> 07:42.586
you know, our future,

07:43.338 --> 07:44.839
you're exactly right.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.217
And I'm so lucky to have you

07:48.844 --> 07:51.178
looking out for us in that way.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.807
But I'm looking out
for us in another way.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.767
I'm looking out for...

07:58.228 --> 08:01.856
That intangible thing
that every couple needs.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.401
It's a little bit of magic,
and a little bit of danger, frankly.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.362
This is gonna solve
a lot of our problems.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.532
This tension right now.
As soon as you get in that thing

08:11.616 --> 08:14.285
and you feel the energy

08:14.369 --> 08:16.203
and you feel it rumble

08:17.038 --> 08:18.664
in your gut.

08:19.749 --> 08:23.919
If you don't get turned on,
you're made of stone.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.006
Where is it?

08:28.425 --> 08:29.925
It's in the driveway.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.765
Are you... Is this...

08:36.850 --> 08:38.267
Oh, come on. Okay, okay... That's...

09:35.492 --> 09:36.492
Hello?

09:36.826 --> 09:37.952
- Mom?
- Jeff.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.203
Hi.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.497
You know, you're supposed to say
"hello" when you pick up the phone.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.915
Yeah, I know.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.251
I thought that maybe
you were somebody else, but you're not.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.045
What do you do in the basement?
You're not cleaning it.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.088
You really want to know?

09:49.172 --> 09:50.256
You didn't like it last time
we had this conversation.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.715
Okay, no. You know what?
You're right. I don't.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.925
Did you get the wood glue?

09:53.009 --> 09:54.551
What are you talking about?

09:54.636 --> 09:56.512
I left you a note on the kitchen counter.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.472
I haven't been upstairs.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.433
One of the shutters on the pantry
is broken and I need you to fix it.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.477
You know what,
I'm kind of busy right now, so...

10:03.561 --> 10:06.438
All I want for my birthday
is for you to get your ass off that couch,

10:06.523 --> 10:07.773
and you get on the bus

10:07.857 --> 10:09.692
- and you go to the Home Depot.
- I'm not on the couch.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.362
You come home and fix the shutter
before I get home,

10:13.446 --> 10:15.114
or you're gonna find
someplace else to live.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.365
- Fine.
- Fine.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.908
Good. You got it? Do you understand?

10:17.993 --> 10:20.369
Yes, Mom! Okay!

10:20.453 --> 10:22.121
Love you! Goodbye.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.040
Did you hang up on me?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.917
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.691
Stop the bus.
Can you please stop the bus?

12:14.776 --> 12:16.819
Sorry. Thank you.

13:11.541 --> 13:12.541
Can I help you?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.087
Can I help you, sir?

13:17.172 --> 13:18.172
No.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.423
What?

13:36.399 --> 13:37.983
Pass the ball!

13:52.165 --> 13:53.207
Go, go, go!

13:59.797 --> 14:01.465
Shit, you a'ight?

14:02.300 --> 14:03.967
Get your big ass up, man.

14:04.302 --> 14:05.886
You bleeding and shit?

14:05.970 --> 14:08.347
- He out, man.
- We need another person.

14:08.431 --> 14:09.765
We need one!

14:11.226 --> 14:12.226
You got next.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.144
Who, him?

14:14.229 --> 14:15.312
He gonna be a ref?

14:15.396 --> 14:17.981
That's all we got. That's all we got.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.900
Let's see what he got.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.319
Let's go, dawg. Get out here.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.044
Oh, he's passing now.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.629
Right there, dawg.
What's your problem?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.548
That's your man.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.347
Why don't you play some D, man?

14:51.641 --> 14:53.308
Right, right, right.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.355
Hell, no!

15:01.734 --> 15:03.819
You working on this? Come on, man.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.493
Go, go, go, go.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.800
I'm Jeff.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.802
Kevin.

15:28.886 --> 15:29.928
Ke...

15:30.013 --> 15:31.138
Kevin.

15:31.222 --> 15:32.389
Is your name Kevin Kevin?

15:33.683 --> 15:34.850
No.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.226
So, that's your first name
on your jersey?

15:36.978 --> 15:38.854
Yeah, that's my name.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.188
Yeah.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.940
Do you live around here?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.943
Yeah, I don't live far from here.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.112
You obviously don't
live around here, though.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.323
No, I was just strolling around today.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.658
It was a nice day,
so I thought I'd walk around.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.744
Were you following me, or...

15:53.828 --> 15:55.120
No. I mean, no.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.580
I saw you on the bus.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.832
Let me explain.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.835
Have you ever seen the movie Signs?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.797
With Mel Gibson and Rory Culkin,
and Abigail Breslin?

16:05.882 --> 16:07.633
Nah, I don't think I have.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.720
I got a phone call this morning.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.639
Someone was asking for Kevin.

16:13.723 --> 16:16.141
But there's no Kevin who lives with me.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.268
It's kind of a common name.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.146
Yeah. I guess that's true.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.689
I mean, you never got a call,

16:22.774 --> 16:24.775
like someone called
the wrong house phone?

16:24.859 --> 16:26.568
What if there's no wrong numbers?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.237
Maybe it's always the right house phone.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.282
Everything happens for a reason, right?

16:35.578 --> 16:37.537
Exactly. No, that's exactly it.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.374
Hey, man, I'm about to go
put something in the air real quick.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.876
I don't know if you want to come.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.879
I don't... I'm sorry...
I don't know what that means.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.381
Smoke weed?

16:49.759 --> 16:51.093
You want to smoke weed with me?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.178
Yeah, man.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.680
I like weed.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.431
Yeah, I can see that.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.444
Wow.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.324
It's nice in here.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.090
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.301
Oh, shit. That's a treat.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.472
Check his pockets!

17:47.442 --> 17:48.984
Sorry, Jeff.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.700
Marriage is a compromise.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.204
She got what she wanted,
I'm living here in Baton Rouge.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.081
So I get a little somethin'-somethin'.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.000
- Right?
- Sure.

18:05.710 --> 18:06.835
Yeah.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.505
Thank you. You know what's up.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.009
I got to take this... It's a business call.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.470
Sweetheart, can I get another Bud Light.
Do you want more wings?

18:19.724 --> 18:20.766
Whatever.

18:22.351 --> 18:26.646
Fine. I will get glue and fix your shutter.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.274
No. It is Jeff's responsibility.
That is the point.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.152
He has to do it, not you.
Jeff has to do it.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.362
Okay. What are you...
Why are you calling me?

18:34.781 --> 18:38.867
Maybe you could get him
moving a little bit. Do you understand?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.786
He's stuck, honey. He's stuck.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.204
He's 30!

18:42.288 --> 18:45.123
He had a difficult adolescent period.

18:45.208 --> 18:49.211
You of all people would know neither of
us had a very easy adolescent period.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.214
- You were older.
- What does that have to do with it?

18:52.298 --> 18:56.301
When you're an adult, you take
responsibility for your life. Okay?

18:56.385 --> 18:58.595
But you're brothers.
You love each other, don't you?

18:58.679 --> 19:02.390
You know, fake it
for a little bit just to get... You know.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.725
Maybe he'll grow on you.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.978
We don't do that, Mom. We don't

19:07.480 --> 19:10.065
spend time together.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.652
Well, Pat, could you at least try?
It's my birthday.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.490
I gotta call you back.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.408
- No, no, no, Pat...
- Bye.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.327
Damn it. Asshole.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.108
Jeff!

19:54.777 --> 19:55.944
Pat?

19:58.447 --> 19:59.698
What the hell are you doing here?

19:59.782 --> 20:02.701
Kevin beat me up. I walked.

20:02.785 --> 20:03.785
Who's Kevin?

20:05.288 --> 20:07.247
Some kid I was following.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.499
Well, if he's a kid,
how come you didn't kick his ass?

20:11.294 --> 20:13.253
Because I don't believe in fighting, Pat.
And you know that.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.838
Right. I forgot. You're a pussy.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.214
Look, Mom called
and she's really pissed.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.507
Was Gandhi a pussy?

20:17.592 --> 20:18.717
Yeah, Gandhi was a pussy.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.845
And once again,
I have to pick up your slack.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.221
Well, it's not your problem.

20:23.306 --> 20:24.306
Well, it becomes my problem

20:24.390 --> 20:26.516
when Mom calls me
in the middle of a business meeting.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.560
Yeah? You're having
a business meeting at Hooters?

20:28.644 --> 20:29.769
Yeah. Yes.

20:29.854 --> 20:30.979
That's very classy.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.857
Right. Well, business is business.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.525
So, come on. Get in the car.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.236
Hey! You don't need to grab onto me.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.196
I'm a little bit conflicted right now,
that's all.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.406
About what?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.074
You're just gonna make fun of me, man.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.242
Let's go. Try me.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.369
I want to learn how you think
because I want to free my mind.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.247
Let me try to explain it to you maybe
in terms that you would understand.

20:49.332 --> 20:50.373
- Okay.
- This morning

20:50.458 --> 20:55.086
I was meant to have
a business meeting with the Kevins.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.797
And destiny. And now you're here

20:57.882 --> 21:00.133
at this weird Hooters thing...

21:00.217 --> 21:03.637
And so now I'm just trying
to figure out how to proceed.

21:03.721 --> 21:06.598
What you just said
sounded like Yoda took acid

21:06.682 --> 21:08.767
and stumbled into a business meeting.

21:08.851 --> 21:11.144
You can make all the fun of Yoda
that you want,

21:11.228 --> 21:13.271
Yoda would be fucking killer
in a business meeting.

21:13.356 --> 21:16.274
Whatever, man. Come on!
Let's go. Get in the Porsche.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.359
Shit!

21:18.694 --> 21:21.613
Hey, I think your Porsche
got a ticket, Pat.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.616
Shut up, Jeff. Just get in the car.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.455
This Porsche is tiny.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.041
The Porsche is normal-sized.
You're a sasquatch.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.670
Are those workout gloves?

21:36.754 --> 21:38.838
I don't think so.
They came with the car so...

21:40.549 --> 21:42.842
Check this out. You see where those
cars are stopping up ahead?

21:42.927 --> 21:43.969
Yeah.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.220
I should probably stop
pretty soon, right?

21:45.513 --> 21:46.638
Pat, slow down.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.890
What? I can't hear you!
Bose surround sound!

21:48.975 --> 21:50.809
Hey, stop it, dude. This is not funny.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.978
- Count to three and I'll stop.
- Pat, please stop.

21:53.062 --> 21:56.147
Count of three! One! Two!

21:56.232 --> 21:57.399
- Pat, look out!
- Three!

21:58.734 --> 21:59.901
Curb! Curb!

21:59.986 --> 22:00.986
Shit! Yes!

22:01.404 --> 22:02.487
Will you please stop the car?

22:02.822 --> 22:04.656
It handles better at high speeds!

22:04.740 --> 22:06.157
- Stop the car!
- Shut up!

22:08.119 --> 22:09.119
Tree! Tree!

22:19.922 --> 22:20.922
Pat?

22:21.257 --> 22:22.424
Fuck!

22:22.508 --> 22:24.801
Wow. Yeah, that's real bad.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.053
Oh, shit.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.805
What the fuck?

22:29.390 --> 22:30.473
He looks mad.

22:30.558 --> 22:31.725
Are you on drugs?

22:31.809 --> 22:33.309
How many beers have you had?

22:33.436 --> 22:35.603
Shut up, Jeff. Shut up.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.814
Did you not see that damn tree?

22:37.898 --> 22:41.109
Whatever you do, don't say a word.
Stay in the fucking car.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.778
I am fine, yes. Thank you for asking.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.114
Burt, should we call an ambulance?

22:46.198 --> 22:48.616
Hi. There was a pedestrian child

22:48.701 --> 22:52.037
in the street
and in order to avoid killing it,

22:52.121 --> 22:55.081
I had to swerve
and maneuver onto your sidewalk,

22:55.166 --> 22:57.876
at which point I lost control
of my vehicle

22:57.960 --> 22:59.461
and I've hit your tree here.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.254
We can see that.
Do you think we're blind?

23:01.380 --> 23:04.382
No. Of course not.
I just would like to apologize.

23:04.467 --> 23:05.717
Is he okay?

23:05.801 --> 23:07.260
Yeah, he's fine. Just a little stunned.

23:07.344 --> 23:10.472
I think that one's hurt.
Maybe we should call the police.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.015
He's fine. He's okay.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.475
That childâs not moving.

23:13.559 --> 23:17.896
Ma'am, he's okay.
Jeff, will you get out of the car?

23:17.980 --> 23:19.647
Yeah. Get out of the car.

23:20.441 --> 23:21.649
Show her that you're fine.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.277
See? Live and limber.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.362
- Baby, are you sure you're all right?
- Look at that.

23:26.447 --> 23:28.031
- I am fine, thank you.
- Look at that. Good as new.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.116
You remind me of my grandson.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.827
Is his name Kevin, by any chance?

23:33.204 --> 23:34.537
Brian, why?

23:35.206 --> 23:36.498
No reason, ma'am.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.876
Do you think there's any way that you
and I can take care of this ourselves?

23:39.960 --> 23:42.545
I really don't want to hang out here
all afternoon with the cops.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.964
I don't know...
There's some bark off that tree.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.716
It might have ruined the tree, baby.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.468
Whoa. Is that Linda?

23:48.719 --> 23:50.845
Give me 500 bucks,
and we'll call it even.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.639
Excuse me?

23:52.723 --> 23:54.349
No "excuse me," man.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.726
Look at my tree here.
That's a 200-year-old tree.

23:56.811 --> 23:58.228
Might have to do some landscaping.

23:58.312 --> 23:59.604
I'll probably have
to bring a tractor in here

23:59.688 --> 24:00.897
and a backhoe and dig all this stuff up.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.107
It's a tree!

24:02.650 --> 24:03.942
Have you been drinking?

24:05.236 --> 24:06.402
No.

24:06.904 --> 24:10.615
Why don't we just
let the police decide that. Call 911.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.283
- $100.
- Times five.

24:13.327 --> 24:14.994
- $150.
- Plus $350.

24:15.079 --> 24:17.247
- Fine. Call the police.
- Call 911.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.082
God damn it!

24:20.835 --> 24:22.043
You take a check?

24:22.503 --> 24:24.379
Yeah. No problem.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.755
Oh, good.

24:26.674 --> 24:28.466
Boy, he's got some nerve, don't he?

24:28.551 --> 24:30.093
Trying to negotiate
with you about our tree.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.846
He come in my yard, hit my tree.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.973
You look at that tree
and he don't think he owes me.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.142
Who's that guy she's with?

24:39.061 --> 24:40.895
Get in the car, Jeff.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.403
It was very, very quick
and it could have been somebody...

26:12.488 --> 26:16.658
She was wearing a peach dress
that she wore this morning, okay?

26:16.742 --> 26:18.409
And they got into our car!

26:21.664 --> 26:24.040
Man, something really big
is happening here.

26:24.124 --> 26:28.670
Yeah, no shit, Jeff!
My wife is having an affair!

26:28.754 --> 26:29.837
We don't know that yet.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.422
Let's follow this
and see where this leads.

26:31.507 --> 26:34.008
Well, I'm trying to,
but I can't see dick so it's kind of hard.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.430
Go! Go! Go, go!

26:41.392 --> 26:42.433
Hang on.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.020
- I see them!
- Where?

26:46.105 --> 26:47.855
They're just up here to the left!

26:48.357 --> 26:49.774
There they are! Pat.

26:50.359 --> 26:52.193
What the fuck are you doing?

26:52.444 --> 26:53.611
You told me to hurry!

26:53.696 --> 26:55.947
Tell me before you swerve
so I don't fall off the fucking car!

26:56.031 --> 27:00.201
Okay. Whatever, just focus on the road!
Where are they going?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.455
They're turning up there!

27:04.540 --> 27:05.540
What street?

27:06.375 --> 27:08.459
South Clark! South Clark!

27:08.794 --> 27:11.129
They're going to Cochon! Damn it!

27:13.048 --> 27:14.465
Let me tell you about Cochon.

27:14.550 --> 27:17.176
It's full of A-holes
who look down on everybody

27:17.261 --> 27:20.388
that's not, like, part of the cool-guy club.
It's so lame.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.557
Look at this, no parking.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.933
I can wait with the car.

27:24.018 --> 27:25.310
No. I got it.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.479
Pat, there's a fire hydrant!

27:29.231 --> 27:30.398
There's a fire hydrant right here.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.317
I got it.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.239
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.657
Come on. Let's go.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.998
Okay, what we got here
is a friendly lunch.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.499
It could be a coworker.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.918
It could be a long-lost cousin.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.421
She hates her coworkers
and I know her whole family.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.384
We got to hear what they're saying.

27:59.053 --> 28:01.220
Well, body language
can tell you a lot, man.

28:06.477 --> 28:08.186
- You're going in there.
- What, me?

28:08.270 --> 28:09.395
Yeah.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.397
I'm not really dressed properly, Pat.

28:11.482 --> 28:14.108
Why don't you just go in there
and talk to her?

28:14.234 --> 28:15.651
This could all be
a huge misunderstanding.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.779
If I talk to her, she's just gonna deny it.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.031
Why wouldn't she tell you the truth?

28:20.115 --> 28:22.784
Oh, my God. You have no idea
how adult relationships work, do you?

28:23.452 --> 28:25.536
You haven't had a girlfriend
since high school.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.622
- So? So?
- So? So...

28:27.998 --> 28:30.541
I need to find out
exactly what's going on

28:30.626 --> 28:32.251
so I'll have the upper hand later.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.296
Do you still love Linda?

28:36.924 --> 28:39.175
There's an empty booth next to them.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.468
Okay?

28:40.552 --> 28:42.678
Just sneak in with my phone.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.305
Here's a little grease money.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.266
Okay. Get in there,
do what you got to do.

28:59.613 --> 29:00.947
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:02.032 --> 29:04.409
- How do you do? Lovely.
- Fine, thank you.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.785
Can I help you?

29:05.869 --> 29:07.328
Table for one, please.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.748
- Right this way.
- Great. Thank you.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.500
- Oh, miss?
- Yes?

29:12.584 --> 29:15.253
Could I sit there?

29:16.213 --> 29:18.923
Those tables are saved for two patrons.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.174
- Right.
- Right this way.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.927
Miss? You know what? Excuse me.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.555
There are going to be two patrons.
There will be two patrons.

29:25.639 --> 29:27.056
You said table of one.

29:27.558 --> 29:30.435
I meant that more like
in the bistro sense,

29:30.519 --> 29:31.936
like one plus another one?

29:32.020 --> 29:35.773
Well, just in case, I think this table back
here would be quite lovely for you guys.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.068
What if I grease you?

29:39.319 --> 29:40.361
I'm sorry?

29:40.904 --> 29:43.114
I have money.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.993
There's two fives, some ones.
There's a 20.

29:47.077 --> 29:50.204
If I could just sit at that table.
I can't explain.

29:50.998 --> 29:53.082
But it's really important.

30:08.682 --> 30:11.225
I mean, I honestly don't even feel
like he really likes me.

30:11.768 --> 30:14.812
Well, that's his problem. I mean...

30:15.022 --> 30:16.856
From where I stand,
there's plenty to like.

30:16.940 --> 30:20.067
Thank you, Steve.
You're a really good listener.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.360
Thank you.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.987
It's such a treat.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.363
I'm just being myself.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.616
Don't say anything.
She might recognize your voice.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.576
If you can hear me,
give me a thumbs-up.

30:29.703 --> 30:33.206
Okay, now take the talking part
of the phone and hold it,

30:33.624 --> 30:35.625
but keep it low, don't let them see.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.877
I really don't think that
you want to hear this.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.337
Jeff, just do it! Okay?

30:39.421 --> 30:41.797
Stop talking
so I can hear what's going on.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.886
I can't. Honestly,
I lost a lot of friends because of Pat.

30:46.970 --> 30:51.307
'Cause my friends just don't like him.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.768
I think a little bit's my fault,

30:53.852 --> 30:55.436
'cause I would complain
a lot to them and...

30:56.730 --> 31:00.566
For a really long time,
I've felt like he and I are...

31:00.943 --> 31:02.026
I don't know...

31:02.110 --> 31:05.154
We got, like,
weirdly competitive with each other.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.406
We just never communicate.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.367
He just never listens, ever.

31:11.245 --> 31:12.495
Gosh.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.998
I shouldn't even be talking about this

31:16.083 --> 31:20.253
but we haven't had sex in...
I mean, over two months.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.048
That's a long time.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.759
And I think, kind of,
what's worse than that

31:26.843 --> 31:28.886
is that it's so awkward.

31:29.263 --> 31:30.805
Well, having sex is one thing

31:32.599 --> 31:34.600
but making love
is something else, right?

31:36.186 --> 31:38.187
What does that even mean?

31:38.272 --> 31:39.397
Thank you, Steve.

31:39.481 --> 31:42.233
I'm not used to being able
to talk so openly with someone

31:42.317 --> 31:47.029
and have them listen,
and care what I'm saying and...

31:47.114 --> 31:48.239
Hey!

31:48.323 --> 31:50.283
Hey! Hey!

31:50.367 --> 31:51.701
Wait!

31:53.954 --> 31:55.288
Pat, what do you want
me to do now, huh?

31:55.372 --> 31:57.999
Hello, my name is Rob. Can I start you
out with something to drink?

31:58.542 --> 31:59.709
Some water.

31:59.793 --> 32:00.960
Excuse me?

32:01.295 --> 32:02.878
- I'll have water.
- I'm sorry?

32:02.963 --> 32:04.630
I'll take some fuckin' water, Rob.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.173
Absolutely.

32:09.886 --> 32:10.886
Jeff?

32:12.681 --> 32:13.973
Whoa! Hey.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.558
- Wow!
- Hi.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.767
What are you doing here?

32:17.394 --> 32:20.605
I'm just... Lunching it up, you know?

32:20.689 --> 32:22.607
Getting a little bistro action.

32:22.691 --> 32:23.816
I...

32:23.900 --> 32:26.694
Have you ever met my friend, Steve?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.904
This is my brother-in-law, Jeff.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.948
- This is Steve.
- Hey, Jeff, nice to meet you, man.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.825
- My friend Steve.
- Steve.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.785
We were just gonna leave.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.288
Did you still want me
to drop you off at your car?

32:37.372 --> 32:38.581
Yep. Yeah.

32:40.000 --> 32:45.004
So, I'm going to take him to his car,
and I'll see you later.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.089
Hope so.

32:47.174 --> 32:48.591
Nice meeting you, Jeff.

32:55.432 --> 32:56.766
Pat, they're coming out...

32:59.770 --> 33:01.354
What the fuck?

33:03.065 --> 33:06.150
Jeff! They went that way!

33:06.234 --> 33:07.568
Pat! Well, then, let's go get the car!

33:07.653 --> 33:08.986
- No car!
- What?

33:09.071 --> 33:10.488
No car! Help me get a cab!

33:10.572 --> 33:12.114
What are you talkin' about?
What happened to the car?

33:12.199 --> 33:14.408
Nothing! It got towed.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.578
- That's not funny!
- I'm not...

33:17.663 --> 33:19.955
- I know. I know it's not.
- It's so not funny!

33:20.040 --> 33:21.415
Help me get a cab!

33:21.500 --> 33:23.918
- There's no way to know where they are.
- Great.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.337
What do we do?

33:28.090 --> 33:30.341
I think we should just
sit down right here.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.344
And?
And wait.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.679
- For what?
- For a sign.

33:34.763 --> 33:37.014
I'm not gonna sit here
and wait for a fucking sign!

33:37.099 --> 33:38.599
Okay, well, then let's walk!

33:38.684 --> 33:41.268
A school bus just drove by! It's a sign!

33:41.353 --> 33:42.603
What does it mean?

33:42.688 --> 33:44.271
Do we go to a school?

33:44.356 --> 33:47.274
Is my wife fucking some guy
in a janitor closet?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.902
I don't think that's it.
I don't think that's it.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.821
- That's not it.
- Good guess.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.032
Now what?

33:58.537 --> 33:59.620
What are you doing?

33:59.705 --> 34:01.372
I'm looking for a credit card slip.

34:02.082 --> 34:03.290
I don't see why.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.042
If I find the slip, I get his last name

34:05.127 --> 34:07.420
and then we can look up
where he lives and go beat him up.

34:07.504 --> 34:09.672
No, I get it. I just don't think
they throw those things away.

34:09.755 --> 34:11.757
Just shut up and help.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.634
Find it yet?

34:14.553 --> 34:16.469
- How about now?
- That's not helping!

34:16.554 --> 34:19.306
I think we've gotten
off track somewhere.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.976
Like I've gotten off track.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.230
Something feels wrong.

34:26.313 --> 34:28.190
Fine. I'll do it myself,

34:28.275 --> 34:30.650
if it'll make you stop talking.

34:31.485 --> 34:32.862
- Is that it?
- No.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.112
It's not.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.906
Oh, God.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.158
What is that?

34:38.744 --> 34:40.411
No, don't do it, Pat.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.246
You don't have to smell it.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.664
Pat. Okay.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.753
- Hey.
- Hey, Carol.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.214
That was yummy.

34:54.509 --> 34:55.551
What're you doing?

34:59.097 --> 35:00.389
Don't tell anybody else.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.433
What?

35:02.517 --> 35:04.185
Somebody's messing with me.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.061
- Really?
- Yeah, in this office.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.938
- No.
- Yeah. I got hit by a plane.

35:08.356 --> 35:11.025
- What?
- A little paper plane came into my...

35:12.903 --> 35:17.364
And all these messages
were coming to me on my computer.

35:17.532 --> 35:18.783
Kind of...

35:19.951 --> 35:21.452
- Flirty stuff.
- Flirty?

35:21.536 --> 35:22.912
I know someone's playin'
some kind of a joke

35:22.996 --> 35:24.121
and I think it's those guys

35:24.206 --> 35:26.582
that are in the back over there
that did the fantasy football.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.167
Oh, my God, those guys are so hot.

35:28.251 --> 35:31.295
That would be so good.
They're young, too.

35:33.006 --> 35:34.340
Do you think it's Henry?

35:35.342 --> 35:36.675
- Henry?
- Yeah.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.345
He's kind of...

35:40.222 --> 35:41.388
Interesting.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.140
He's married, isn't he?

35:43.225 --> 35:45.142
Okay, let's just say it is somebody here.

35:45.227 --> 35:48.604
What does the message say?
Like what are the details?

35:48.688 --> 35:51.357
Well, somethin' about, you know...

35:52.317 --> 35:53.526
What?

35:54.361 --> 35:56.612
That they're a secret admirer.

35:56.696 --> 35:57.863
They said they were...

35:59.199 --> 36:00.658
I think that's kind of hot.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.409
No, it's not. It's ridiculous.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.954
And I don't like being the butt of a joke.

36:05.038 --> 36:06.247
How do you know it's a joke?

36:06.331 --> 36:09.750
I mean, how many times do we get
to get juiced up like this?

36:09.835 --> 36:11.502
This is awesome.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.671
I'm not getting juiced up over a joke.

36:13.755 --> 36:17.633
You're getting attention.
I am super-jelly. I want attention.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.385
You're impossible.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.512
When was the last time
you had a relationship?

36:21.596 --> 36:24.682
Well, my husband, of course.

36:24.766 --> 36:25.933
No way.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.810
Well, I mean, I went out on dates.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.728
Come on. I've been to the movies.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.189
- It's no wonder you're so cranky.
- I've been bowling...

36:32.274 --> 36:34.233
- I'm not...
- Yeah, you need to get busy.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.068
- You need to get your pipes cleaned.
- You think I'm...

36:36.152 --> 36:38.112
You need to get f... Yeah.

36:41.241 --> 36:42.575
Well, I won't tell anyone. Pinky swear.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.290
What else? What else?

36:50.250 --> 36:53.294
I did hear her say that
she felt neglected.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.464
Sounds like they're banging already.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.508
It's possible.

37:00.093 --> 37:03.053
Don't ever get married, dude.
It fucking sucks.

37:03.138 --> 37:06.432
Really? I think it would
be kind of awesome.

37:06.516 --> 37:08.017
Well, it's not.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.060
Okay.

37:10.312 --> 37:12.688
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

37:12.772 --> 37:13.898
Okay.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.941
I'm sick of walking.

37:16.443 --> 37:17.610
Okay.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.993
Is that what I think it is?

37:42.052 --> 37:45.638
You know, I've been havin' this really
weird dream about Dad lately.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.015
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.184
He's a teacher.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.019
And...

37:52.145 --> 37:53.854
We're in this classroom
with a whole bunch of kids,

37:53.939 --> 37:55.481
and we all sit down.

37:55.565 --> 37:56.941
And Dad asks everyone,

37:57.025 --> 37:59.401
"What's the greatest day
in the history of the world?"

38:00.320 --> 38:02.446
And one kid is like, "Christmas."

38:02.530 --> 38:04.865
And Dad's like, "No."

38:05.659 --> 38:07.034
And whenever they get
the answer wrong,

38:07.118 --> 38:08.160
they have to leave the room.

38:09.496 --> 38:13.332
And eventually it's just me and Dad.

38:13.416 --> 38:16.293
And he looks at me and says,

38:16.378 --> 38:18.587
"Pat, what's the greatest day
in the history of the world?"

38:18.672 --> 38:20.422
And I don't know, 'cause I'm nervous.

38:20.507 --> 38:22.132
And I'm like,
"Dad, I don't know."

38:22.217 --> 38:24.176
And he just looks at me
and he smiles and he says...

38:24.260 --> 38:27.262
He says, "Today." He says, "Today."

38:28.223 --> 38:29.348
How'd you know that?

38:29.432 --> 38:31.892
He says, "Today is the greatest day
in the history of the world."

38:32.394 --> 38:33.936
Yeah.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.146
I have that dream, Pat.

38:36.231 --> 38:39.692
Except in mine, it's me,
you and Dad in his car.

38:42.445 --> 38:43.988
Okay.

38:52.622 --> 38:55.708
I guess it's just something he said
to us when we were kids or somethin'.

38:55.792 --> 38:58.919
It's like floating' around
in both of our brains.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.923
What is wrong with you?

39:06.136 --> 39:07.636
- Pat.
- What? What?

39:07.721 --> 39:08.679
What is wrong with you?

39:08.763 --> 39:10.556
Why do you want to be like this?

39:12.392 --> 39:14.059
- What are you talking about?
- We had... We were havin'...

39:14.978 --> 39:16.478
We're having the same dream!

39:17.230 --> 39:18.564
What the fuck are you talking about?

39:18.648 --> 39:19.940
Why do you want to live like this?

39:20.608 --> 39:25.404
You're drifting through this life with
no awareness of how special this is.

39:25.488 --> 39:28.157
You want to talk about what's
happening right now, right here?

39:28.908 --> 39:30.242
What's happening right now

39:30.326 --> 39:32.661
is that I'm getting lectured
by my pothead brother

39:32.746 --> 39:35.122
who lives in our mom's basement
at 30 years old

39:35.206 --> 39:36.957
about how I don't
understand the universe!

39:37.042 --> 39:39.460
Hey, here's some understanding for you.

39:39.544 --> 39:44.423
A job and a car
and a wife and an apartment!

39:45.175 --> 39:46.341
I got to go.

39:46.426 --> 39:47.551
What?

39:47.635 --> 39:49.595
- I have to go, Pat.
- Where are you going?

39:49.679 --> 39:51.972
You know what? You wouldn't...
You would laugh at me again.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.058
Jesus Christ.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.642
You see a fucking truck

39:55.727 --> 39:57.352
with the word "Kevin" on it
and you have to run after it?

39:57.437 --> 39:58.937
Yeah. I do.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.773
I wish I was that stupid!

40:01.524 --> 40:02.858
You're a dick!

40:03.777 --> 40:05.569
You know what?
I have an asshole for a brother.

40:05.653 --> 40:06.737
It breaks my heart.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.530
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

40:08.615 --> 40:10.699
- You call me an asshole?
- Yeah, you are an asshole!

40:10.784 --> 40:12.743
You fucking piece of shit!

40:12.827 --> 40:14.161
You drive a fucking Boxster!

40:14.245 --> 40:15.370
Fuck you!

40:16.915 --> 40:17.915
Don't do this, Pat!

40:17.999 --> 40:19.416
Fuck you!

40:19.501 --> 40:21.126
You get down.
Get down on the fucking ground!

40:21.211 --> 40:22.377
Fucking idiot!

40:28.134 --> 40:31.386
You and Mom will never understand me.

40:31.471 --> 40:33.555
And you're all I have left!

40:59.541 --> 41:00.666
Another Jack and Coke?

41:02.377 --> 41:03.627
Nope.

41:04.504 --> 41:06.004
Got to get home.

41:07.090 --> 41:08.382
Old lady, huh?

41:08.925 --> 41:10.509
No, she's boning another dude.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.219
Right on.

42:45.146 --> 42:48.440
Stop the car. Stop. Please, stop?

43:01.829 --> 43:03.413
- Hi.
- Hello.

43:03.706 --> 43:07.960
Hey, so, my sister and her husband
just got here a little while ago

43:08.044 --> 43:11.088
in that red Camry out there. And...

43:12.507 --> 43:15.509
I need to... I'm meeting them. So...

43:15.593 --> 43:17.010
- Okay...
- Actually,

43:18.054 --> 43:19.263
it's an emergency.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.556
I have to get her medication,
like, right now,

43:21.641 --> 43:22.683
so what's her room number?

43:23.434 --> 43:26.270
We have a privacy policy, sir.
I'm sorry, I can't give you her number.

43:26.354 --> 43:29.481
I know it's like policy and everything,
but this is a family emergency,

43:29.565 --> 43:31.024
so maybe you could just
give me the room number...

43:31.109 --> 43:32.276
It'll take me a second to call.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.403
I lied. It's not an emergency.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.698
It's not a health emergency.

43:38.241 --> 43:39.992
It is a financial emergency.

43:43.204 --> 43:45.539
Their home is about to be foreclosed on

43:45.623 --> 43:49.209
and I need to make a payment.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.345
- Just stop.
- Okay.

44:00.430 --> 44:02.180
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- Right.

44:45.725 --> 44:47.309
- Thank you.
- Excuse me?

44:47.393 --> 44:49.269
No, just thank you so much.

44:54.609 --> 44:55.609
Pat! Pat!

44:55.777 --> 44:56.777
Oh, my God. Jeff.

44:56.861 --> 44:58.320
- Oh, my God, Pat.
- What the fuck?

44:58.404 --> 44:59.529
I was on the truck.

44:59.614 --> 45:01.656
The truck came here
and now you're here.

45:01.741 --> 45:03.492
- This shit is aligned!
- Shut the fuck up.

45:03.576 --> 45:06.119
- What?
- Linda is here,

45:06.204 --> 45:07.621
in this hotel somewhere.

45:10.500 --> 45:13.293
- With the guy?
- Yeah, probably with the guy.

45:14.295 --> 45:15.629
Sorry.

45:15.713 --> 45:17.297
How the fuck did you find me?

45:17.382 --> 45:18.632
It was the candy man.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.138
Oh, shit.

45:25.223 --> 45:26.640
He's right there.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.225
Okay, what should we do?

45:28.643 --> 45:29.976
Duck in there.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.103
I'm gigantic!

45:49.747 --> 45:51.998
Come on, let's go.

46:39.547 --> 46:40.630
What do you want to do?

46:41.466 --> 46:44.217
Should we stay? Should we wait?

46:45.261 --> 46:47.471
Do we just wait, or...

46:48.723 --> 46:50.056
We could wait.

46:50.141 --> 46:51.641
I don't know. I don't...

46:52.935 --> 46:54.478
Should I call her?

46:54.562 --> 46:57.189
Maybe I call her cell phone right now.

46:57.273 --> 47:00.108
And then, like, act innocent
and be like, "What's going on?"

47:00.610 --> 47:01.735
You could try that.

47:01.903 --> 47:05.155
You know, you're not
fucking helping at all.

47:05.239 --> 47:07.574
You're just like,
"Do you want to do that?"

47:07.742 --> 47:09.409
Do you want to know
what I think you should do?

47:09.494 --> 47:10.577
Yeah.

47:10.661 --> 47:11.870
I think you should take
a few deep breaths,

47:11.954 --> 47:13.955
close your eyes,

47:14.081 --> 47:15.415
and focus.

47:15.917 --> 47:21.004
That is like stupid fucking
Jeff mumbo-jumbo.

47:21.088 --> 47:25.550
If you have any other idea, even one,

47:25.635 --> 47:28.762
I'll be happy to try it
without making fun of you.

47:29.889 --> 47:31.473
Okay, all right.

47:33.768 --> 47:35.268
Okay. Close your eyes.

47:39.607 --> 47:41.066
What do you see?

47:43.611 --> 47:46.530
I just can't stop picturing
what's going on.

47:47.156 --> 47:50.242
What if she's, like,
giving him a hand job?

47:50.493 --> 47:52.953
You know, I think they're adults.

47:53.037 --> 47:55.288
It's probably unlikely
she's giving him a hand job.

47:57.250 --> 47:58.500
I'm gonna break down the door.

47:58.584 --> 47:59.876
No. Pat.

47:59.961 --> 48:01.169
I'm gonna break it down.

48:01.254 --> 48:03.838
Listen. Wait, hold on.
That's a terrible idea.

48:03.923 --> 48:07.259
I've seen you try to do things physically.

48:07.385 --> 48:08.760
I'll do it.

48:10.179 --> 48:11.596
Do you think you can do that?

48:11.681 --> 48:13.848
I wish I could get
some sort of running start.

48:13.933 --> 48:16.601
You totally can. There's, like, hallways.

48:16.686 --> 48:17.894
You run and turn.

48:17.979 --> 48:19.980
Parallel isn't gonna help me.

48:20.064 --> 48:22.232
You could run
and turn right at the last second.

48:22.316 --> 48:24.985
I wouldn't... No. That's not gonna work.

48:25.361 --> 48:26.444
All right.

48:31.158 --> 48:32.325
One,

48:32.451 --> 48:33.493
two,

48:34.328 --> 48:35.495
three!

48:35.997 --> 48:37.163
Fuck!

48:37.248 --> 48:38.582
- Run!
- What was that?

48:38.666 --> 48:40.292
- Are you okay?
- Fuck!

48:40.376 --> 48:41.668
Get up!

48:41.752 --> 48:43.169
- Linda!
- Pat! What are you...

48:43.254 --> 48:45.088
- Pat, don't... Pat, stop!
- What's going on?

48:45.172 --> 48:46.673
- Steve, let him go!
- Either you're gonna calm down...

48:46.757 --> 48:48.341
- Let him go! Jeff!
- Don't fucking move!

48:48.426 --> 48:50.010
- What are you doing?
- What the hell is going on?

48:50.094 --> 48:51.886
- We just got here!
- Who are you people?

48:51.971 --> 48:54.264
You, shut up! Who the fuck is this guy?

48:54.348 --> 48:55.599
He's just a friend, okay? Calm down.

48:55.683 --> 48:57.475
- There's wine!
- Yeah!

48:57.560 --> 49:01.104
There's a bottle of wine on ice, and a...
What is this?

49:01.188 --> 49:02.355
- That's a...
A sex board?

49:02.440 --> 49:03.940
No, you bring it with the... Pat!

49:04.025 --> 49:06.568
And your face is flushed,
which means you're horny.

49:06.652 --> 49:08.945
- No!
- What the fuck is going on?

49:09.030 --> 49:11.281
Stop yelling and I'll answer
all of your questions.

49:11.365 --> 49:14.701
Excuse me! Excuse me!
I'm ready to go home.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.161
Linda, I think you should come with me.

49:16.245 --> 49:18.622
Excuse me!
You should shut the fuck up!

49:18.706 --> 49:20.874
I think that you should go
and I'll call you later.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.167
You're not calling this fucking guy.

49:22.251 --> 49:23.376
Linda, do you want me to stay?

49:23.461 --> 49:25.879
- I think you should go.
- You should go! You need to go!

49:26.005 --> 49:27.714
I'm gonna stay and talk to Pat, okay?

49:27.798 --> 49:29.758
Time for you to go, man.

49:30.176 --> 49:31.760
- Get out, bro!
- All right, Pat.

49:31.844 --> 49:33.053
Get out!

49:34.388 --> 49:38.224
Okay. Start talking.
Is there anyone else in here?

49:42.938 --> 49:45.231
Well, I'm a little upset, actually,

49:45.316 --> 49:47.150
- and I think that it's understandable!
- I understand that.

49:47.234 --> 49:50.862
Look, what I need to know...
I just need to know one thing, okay?

49:50.946 --> 49:52.364
- Okay. What?
- Okay.

49:54.700 --> 49:57.744
Are you mad because you came in here
and you found me with another man?

49:58.079 --> 49:59.162
Yes.

50:01.165 --> 50:02.540
- Yes.
- Or...

50:03.542 --> 50:06.461
Or are you mad because
you're afraid that you might lose me?

50:06.545 --> 50:08.296
What? There's like a part B now?

50:08.547 --> 50:09.839
Please, don't do that.

50:09.924 --> 50:11.257
It's just semantic bullshit!

50:11.342 --> 50:12.926
- No, it isn't! It isn't!
- Yeah, it is!

50:13.010 --> 50:14.469
- You really don't know the difference.
- You know what?

50:14.553 --> 50:15.970
Because if you don't understand
the difference...

50:16.055 --> 50:19.307
Linda! Linda.
I'm gonna try to listen to you

50:19.392 --> 50:21.893
blabber about whatever this is.

50:22.186 --> 50:25.105
And I'm gonna try to understand
your incoherent babble. Go.

50:25.690 --> 50:27.357
- Why do you always do that?
- What?

50:27.692 --> 50:29.567
- I'm listening.
- No, you're not.

50:29.652 --> 50:30.985
Yeah, I'm trying.

50:31.195 --> 50:33.530
You always just make me feel so stupid!

50:33.781 --> 50:37.534
I'm sorry it's stupid!
I catch you trying to cheat on me and...

50:37.785 --> 50:39.786
You make fun of everything I say.

50:39.870 --> 50:43.873
I'm really just trying to have
a conversation with you right now.

50:43.999 --> 50:47.168
This is why our relationship
is so fucked.

50:47.878 --> 50:50.213
Because you know what?
When I asked you

50:50.297 --> 50:53.675
if you would take me to Cochon

50:53.801 --> 50:55.468
you laughed at me.

50:55.886 --> 50:57.679
Who care... I'm sorry. That's...

50:57.763 --> 51:02.016
But when I asked Steve,
he just, you know, said, let's go.

51:02.143 --> 51:03.768
Yeah, 'cause he wanted
to get in your pants!

51:03.978 --> 51:07.897
Well, maybe, but at least he's trying
to put in some time and effort!

51:10.401 --> 51:12.694
Let me tell you
something about Cochon.

51:12.778 --> 51:14.988
- Cochon is full of assholes...
- You're not even...

51:15.072 --> 51:17.490
...and snobs in fucking turquoise

51:17.575 --> 51:20.577
tailored shirts and pink ties,
like that asshole!

51:20.911 --> 51:22.454
You want to ask me to take you there?

51:22.538 --> 51:25.081
Fine. I'll take you to fucking Cochon.
We'll...

51:25.166 --> 51:27.500
- Yeah.
- God, you're not even listening to me.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.002
No, I'm hearing you loud and clear.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.920
You're not! It's not about the restaurant.

51:31.005 --> 51:34.174
I just want you to, like,
care that I want to go there!

51:34.675 --> 51:36.593
And do you think it's about this guy?

51:36.677 --> 51:39.679
Because I really don't even
fucking care about him! He's nice.

51:39.764 --> 51:41.765
- He listens to me.
- I'm nice.

51:41.974 --> 51:43.850
But you and I, we are petty,

51:43.934 --> 51:46.019
we are passive-aggressive
with each other,

51:46.103 --> 51:49.022
we don't even fight!
I mean, this is a miracle right now!

51:49.857 --> 51:53.651
And what I think, honestly,
is that we have no house,

51:53.736 --> 51:55.904
we have no kids, thank God!

51:56.030 --> 51:58.907
It would be really fucking easy
for us to just walk away!

51:58.991 --> 52:00.450
It'd be super simple.

52:00.534 --> 52:02.202
And that is what I think
that we should do.

52:07.541 --> 52:08.875
Hang on, hang on.

52:14.048 --> 52:16.257
You know, let's just not,
like, let's just not...

52:16.342 --> 52:17.967
Can we not talk about this anymore?

52:18.052 --> 52:20.595
Let's just go home
and sleep on it, and, like...

52:21.764 --> 52:23.765
And like...

52:24.892 --> 52:26.226
Forget it.

52:28.562 --> 52:30.104
I'm gonna go stay at my mom's.

52:40.908 --> 52:42.242
Bye, Jeff.

52:44.703 --> 52:45.995
Jeffrey, where are you?

52:46.080 --> 52:48.957
I asked you to call me
after you got the wood glue.

52:49.041 --> 52:50.667
I'm at the office.

52:50.751 --> 52:53.503
Let me know what's going on.
Thanks. Bye.

53:22.992 --> 53:24.242
Oh, please.

54:52.122 --> 54:54.749
It sure is a noisy little thing.

54:54.833 --> 54:56.125
Yeah.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.836
- Eight glasses a day, my doctor says.
- Really?

54:58.921 --> 55:00.838
You're kidding me. Blow out my biceps

55:00.923 --> 55:03.716
trying to lift these cups that many times.

55:08.597 --> 55:10.390
- I'm Barry.
- Sharon.

55:10.891 --> 55:12.517
Nice to meet you.

55:12.601 --> 55:13.935
Same here.

55:14.019 --> 55:15.186
What am I saying?

55:15.270 --> 55:17.438
I know you're Sharon.
I've seen you around.

55:28.492 --> 55:30.493
I really do like flowers.

55:32.496 --> 55:33.663
Yeah?

55:34.039 --> 55:35.123
Like,

55:35.624 --> 55:37.542
metaphorically, too.

55:37.626 --> 55:40.962
Symbolically. All kinds.

55:43.632 --> 55:46.342
Gardenias are my favorite.

55:50.764 --> 55:52.306
I'm not following you.

56:00.524 --> 56:01.858
Excuse me.

56:03.027 --> 56:04.318
It was nice meeting you.

56:17.124 --> 56:18.875
Just stupid.

56:27.843 --> 56:28.926
Sharon?

56:36.518 --> 56:38.144
What's going on?

57:10.594 --> 57:12.428
I think it's over.

57:23.190 --> 57:24.524
What happened?

57:24.733 --> 57:25.775
What?

57:25.859 --> 57:28.945
This is not the way I imagined
my life was gonna be.

57:29.530 --> 57:30.863
How did you imagine it?

57:34.701 --> 57:38.621
I was gonna be in the Peace Corps
and all that crap, you know,

57:38.705 --> 57:42.458
with some guy in an exotic place,

57:42.543 --> 57:46.379
all worldly and giving and shit,

57:48.048 --> 57:50.216
and living in a little hut,

57:50.551 --> 57:54.220
and taking care of cute little kids

57:55.722 --> 57:58.891
and kissing under waterfalls
and stuff, you know.

57:59.560 --> 58:03.146
You can still kiss under waterfalls
and stuff like that.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.897
It's like,

58:05.190 --> 58:08.067
how many good years do I have left?

58:08.735 --> 58:11.028
I hate my kids right now.

58:11.113 --> 58:14.407
I don't know when that happened.
They were so cute.

58:14.908 --> 58:18.744
I look at the pictures of them,
and our family...

58:19.913 --> 58:21.080
Don't cry.

58:21.915 --> 58:23.166
Have some more tissue.

58:30.549 --> 58:32.842
- Don't explain. Oh, God.
- No. I just...

58:32.926 --> 58:36.721
Oh, Carol, I'm sorry.
It'll just make it worse. Don't explain.

58:36.805 --> 58:38.014
But it's not what you think!

58:38.098 --> 58:39.098
Yeah, it is.

58:45.814 --> 58:48.482
I wish that I could

58:51.945 --> 58:55.281
see the world like you.

58:57.284 --> 58:58.492
Really?

59:00.787 --> 59:05.791
I don't know. You have this, like,
belief in this cosmic order.

59:08.003 --> 59:11.631
I really envy that.

59:15.219 --> 59:16.761
You don't want to be like me.

59:18.305 --> 59:21.307
I'm not happy

59:22.309 --> 59:23.851
at all.

59:27.064 --> 59:30.233
You know, since Dad died,
I've had this...

59:30.317 --> 59:33.444
Had this feeling
that it had to be for a reason.

59:35.489 --> 59:39.492
I keep thinking that
the signs are all about me, but maybe...

59:40.494 --> 59:42.745
Maybe they're about you
and your marriage.

59:44.331 --> 59:48.668
My marriage is not good.

59:51.338 --> 59:52.505
It

59:55.175 --> 59:56.676
is a

59:57.678 --> 59:59.345
disaster.

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:02.056
I just want to feel

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.351
like I love Linda.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:10.523
And I want to feel like she loves me.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:18.364
And we both want to, like, be in love.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:26.706
I miss it and I want it so bad.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:34.547
I think you should just say that.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.382
To her.

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:41.887
It's not that simple, Jeff.

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:44.724
I don't know.
I think it could be that simple.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.229
I mean, wouldn't you be psyched
if Linda walked in here right now

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.940
and sat down in this tub
next to you and said,

01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:56.027
"Pat, I want to be
in love with you again"?

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:05.286
That would be awesome.

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:08.998
Dude, you need to say that to her.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.667
You need to tell her that right now.

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.438
- River Parish.
- I am so sorry.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:35.191
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Don't apologize, seriously.

01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:37.026
- But I want to.
- It's okay.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:40.863
No, I just... It was so weird
and didn't come out the way I...

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.449
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
It's just that I'm not gay.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.117
But that's okay. I'm not gay, either.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.619
But you like women.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:48.621
So?

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.123
Well, I like men.

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:55.378
I like men, too. And to me,
it's like, at this point in my life,

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:58.339
whether it's a man or a woman,
it doesn't matter.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.508
I want someone who gets me.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.844
I feel like I deserve that.

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.472
And I think you do, too.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.976
Well, it's important, yes.

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:12.478
But it doesn't mean

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:15.398
I want to sleep with everybody
that understands me. That's all.

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:18.067
No, no, no. That's not my intention.

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:20.444
Isn't the most important thing

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:24.657
finding someone
who sees you exactly as you are?

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:28.911
Who gets the Peace Corps
and the kissing under waterfalls?

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.334
Yeah.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.842
So? Carol? Are you there?

01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:45.094
Hello?

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.762
Shit.

01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:51.267
Okay, sorry, everybody.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:56.814
Just head for the exits! Single file!

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:06.198
Keep it orderly! Please!

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:21.398
Close your eyes.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.461
It's clear. Come on.
There's my car, right here.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.296
Where are we going? We're all wet.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.590
- I don't know. What do you think?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.

01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:48.467
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:52.596
Let's go to the mall and get drinks
with the little umbrellas in them.

01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:54.056
Bigger. Wilder.

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.895
I haven't been to New Orleans
in 20 years. How about that?

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:01.647
It's perfect.

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:04.066
Okay, let's go.

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:10.781
Come on out, everybody!
Just come right out.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:12.384
Shit.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:15.804
What is this?

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:18.807
It looks like really bad traffic.

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:22.061
Well, I mean in your, you know...

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:24.396
- You mean, like, is it a sign?
- I don't know.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:25.814
It could be.

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:29.568
- It definitely could be.
- How do I know what to do?

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:31.987
That's the big question, yeah.

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:34.073
It's a constant struggle.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:40.579
I think you got to go with your gut.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.506
Well, I'm not going to stop now.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:54.426
Right?

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:56.553
Hey, Pat?

01:06:57.597 --> 01:07:00.599
If we don't get a chance
to reconnect today,

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.602
I'm, like, super proud of you.

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:30.504
Linda!

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:33.632
Sorry.

01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:42.099
- Second thoughts?
- Well, I just...

01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:47.020
It's okay.

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.234
Pat?

01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:53.986
Pat!

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:56.655
- I think that's my son.
- Sharon?

01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:58.157
What now, my man?

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:03.162
I guess I'll go back.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.330
We'll have to wait
for all this traffic to clear.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:09.334
You all right?

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:13.005
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:14.631
I just...

01:08:15.467 --> 01:08:17.760
You ever feel like you're waiting forever

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:21.345
to figure out what your destiny is,
and then when you do

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:23.724
it's not really that exciting?

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.224
Linda!

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:07.725
Pat?

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.019
Pat!

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:10.187
Linda!

01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:14.566
What are you doing here?

01:09:16.528 --> 01:09:18.028
I want to be in love again.

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:19.279
What?

01:09:19.948 --> 01:09:22.073
Things have gotten way off track.

01:09:22.951 --> 01:09:24.827
And weird and shitty.

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:27.746
And I'm a big part of that,
and I'm really sorry for it.

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:29.038
- Pat!
- What?

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.834
Honey, what's happening?
What's the matter?

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.752
- Why are you running down...
- Mom?

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:35.379
What's going... Oh, hi.

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:37.631
- Wait, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:38.715
How did you get here?

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.676
In Carolâs... This is Carol.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.969
Hi.

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:43.136
I'm Linda. Nice to meet you.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.555
Jeff... Jeff's here?

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.850
Whoa, hey! Did you see that?

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:56.859
Is he okay? Is he okay?

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.360
Yeah, we're here.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.779
A car just went off the bridge.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.614
There's people inside of it.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.165
Somebody jumped in!

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.900
Wait! Our dad's still down there!

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:38.984
Fuck.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:40.652
Come on.

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:43.697
Help! Help us!

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:44.823
Dad!

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.325
Help!

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:48.577
Come on, girls! Come on. Swim hard!

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:52.289
Come on, honey! Give me your hand.
That a girl. Come on.

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:58.337
- Get back there.
- Dad?

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:02.215
Hey, the car's going down!

01:11:03.343 --> 01:11:05.010
The car's sinking!

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:11.475
Dad!

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:19.691
Jeff!

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.110
Dad!

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:24.029
Come on, Dad!

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:30.869
We need some help over here.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:49.888
Pat?

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:52.724
Over here! Over here!

01:11:54.394 --> 01:11:58.730
Pat!

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:07.114
- Jeff!
- Jeff!

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:11.034
Help! Help!

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:12.661
Man in the water!

01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:14.287
Help!

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:19.167
Two survivors in sight.
Five feet off the first cleat.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:20.585
Coming into the dive deck.

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:22.004
Hurry!

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:23.296
Get a hold of him!

01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:25.007
One, two, three!

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.847
Jeff!

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:33.849
We have an unresponsive person!

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.225
He's not moving!

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:37.519
Call the command center!
Have an ambulance meet us at the pier!

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.438
- Jeff!
- Sir, we got to help him. We got him.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:41.523
Do something! Jesus!

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:42.733
Sir, sir.

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:43.942
Jeff!

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:46.278
- He's not moving!
- Starting CPR!

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:49.031
Get off me! Leave me alone!

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:51.241
You need to sit down!

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:54.828
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

01:12:55.163 --> 01:12:56.663
Jeff, wake up!

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:06.965
- Jeff!
- Still not responding.

01:13:15.683 --> 01:13:16.850
Can you hear me?

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:18.852
Hey, hey, you okay?

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:20.437
Hey.

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:21.688
Sir?

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:24.149
- Are you okay?
- Oh, God.

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:26.777
Let's get blankets!

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:28.195
Sir, stay still.

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:29.780
Let me sit up.

01:13:34.786 --> 01:13:36.453
What happened?

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.207
Everything.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:43.710
I'm hungry.

01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:37.824
And coming up next,

01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:39.910
the story of two girls, their father,

01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:43.538
and the man who was
in the right place at the right time.

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:46.875
The car that was behind us
crashed into the back of us

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:48.793
and then we went over the bridge.

01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:51.004
And then this man,

01:15:51.339 --> 01:15:53.465
he just came and broke our window...

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.551
And he almost died doing it.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.554
If we had lost our dad,

01:16:01.224 --> 01:16:03.975
you know,
I just really can't even imagine it.

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:07.479
We're just really thankful he was there.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.564
We'll be right back with that rescue tale

01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:13.068
of local councilman Kevin Landry
and his two little girls.

01:16:13.152 --> 01:16:15.695
All that and more when we come back.
