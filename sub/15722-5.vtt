WEBVTT

00:00.516 --> 00:02.788
<i>He had a stroke,
he never woke up again.
 </i>

00:03.087 --> 00:04.448
He had a stroke.

00:04.747 --> 00:07.668
Oh, Bob.
What are you doing here?

00:08.066 --> 00:11.112
- Bob meet Glenn.
- Hi, Glenn.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.228
I think you've found
the cure to juvenile diabetes.

00:14.427 --> 00:15.921
Oh my God!

00:16.087 --> 00:17.415
Where did you get 'em?

00:17.643 --> 00:20.411
Ah, the stem cells.
Line A's from San Francisco.

00:20.527 --> 00:22.349
It was one of the few
that Bush sanctioned.

00:22.468 --> 00:24.272
- Line B?
- Korea. Not sanctioned.

00:24.551 --> 00:25.916
- By the U.S.?
- Right.

00:26.055 --> 00:27.870
Ah. Fuck 'em.
We're not doing work in the U.S.

00:28.124 --> 00:31.285
And whatever you do, don't mention this
to the Diabetes Society. Right?

00:31.457 --> 00:32.439
Right.

00:32.656 --> 00:33.813
We have 3 hours
before the conference,

00:33.926 --> 00:35.660
- that should give us enough time.
- Eat your breakfast.

00:35.748 --> 00:37.372
Hey! Come on, Bob!

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.138 --> 00:50.420
You really think
it's safe to be down here?

00:50.787 --> 00:52.970
- I don't want your money.
- What do you want then?

00:53.185 --> 00:55.192
A couple of weeks ago,
she started feeling bad.

00:55.337 --> 00:58.771
And then she started getting dizzy
and she lost her appetite.

00:58.965 --> 01:01.600
She needs to see a fucking doctor. Okay?

01:01.778 --> 01:03.312
It's the same as Sunshine started and

01:03.478 --> 01:05.612
it's not in the blood,
and it's not in the fucking brain...

01:05.856 --> 01:07.572
What else could they have
in common do you think?

01:07.765 --> 01:09.911
They both live in this shithole. Sorry.

01:10.327 --> 01:14.483
- What's the matter?
- All I know is that she's gone.

01:17.238 --> 01:18.720
That's all, man.

01:19.068 --> 01:20.101
Peace.

01:28.558 --> 01:30.060
STEM CELLS HAVE SOULS

01:33.378 --> 01:35.280
No, I'm not really sure
I understand what you're saying.

01:35.416 --> 01:36.923
- You're not listening.
- Yes, I am.

01:36.995 --> 01:38.343
Back door, Bob. Come on.

01:38.395 --> 01:41.021
Are you saying the soul comes
into being at the moment of conception?

01:41.265 --> 01:42.993
- That is God's truth.
- We got it, guys.

01:43.198 --> 01:44.702
So is the soul part of our DNA

01:44.807 --> 01:47.613
or is it an artifact of sperm
meeting egg during sexual union?

01:47.727 --> 01:49.811
Wes, you've got to get her out
of here before the... Oh, shit.

01:49.966 --> 01:52.523
Stem cells have souls...
Souls belong to God!

01:52.835 --> 01:54.773
- Come on!
- Murderers!

03:21.897 --> 03:24.833
2.05 - Massive Changes

03:25.498 --> 03:27.723
You didn't answer my question:
Do you believe in God?

03:27.878 --> 03:29.960
<i>Bob. How many times
have you asked me that?
 </i>

03:30.127 --> 03:31.743
<i>But you never answer.
 </i>

03:31.848 --> 03:34.670
<i>Do you believe that a deity
can hear our prayers?
 </i>

03:34.755 --> 03:37.410
<i>Or is it a divine force that
created our universe?
 </i>

03:37.545 --> 03:39.141
<i>Did that chick spray you with something?
 </i>

03:39.297 --> 03:41.620
<i>Well where do we come from?
A random accident?
 </i>

03:41.767 --> 03:44.423
<i>I came from Lydia and Toumas Sandstrom,
so yeah, it was a random accident.
 </i>

03:44.555 --> 03:46.182
<i>Probably the last time they
ever had sex together.
 </i>

03:46.265 --> 03:48.773
<i>Hey, when did we become
protest central for stem cell nuts?
 </i>

03:48.945 --> 03:51.441
<i>Since the Diabetes Foundation
jumped the gun and announced
 </i>

03:51.525 --> 03:53.990
<i>that Jill derived pancreatic
beta cells from stem cells.
 </i>

03:54.075 --> 03:55.620
She was supposed to keep that quiet.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.420
All I know is Caroline's pounding her

03:57.527 --> 03:59.682
for using a stem cell line
Washington hasn't approved.

03:59.896 --> 04:01.812
Last time I looked this was Canada.

04:01.916 --> 04:05.691
Jill's a U.S. citizen.
We're partly funded by U.S. dollars.

04:05.826 --> 04:09.433
- She's bound by their protocols.
- That's bullshit. Caroline!

04:13.507 --> 04:15.373
Well where do we come from?
A random accident?

04:15.437 --> 04:18.331
I came from Lydia and Toumas Sandstrom.
So, yeah, it was a random accident.

04:18.435 --> 04:20.192
Probably the last time
they ever had sex together.

04:20.346 --> 04:23.233
Hey, since when did
we become protest central...

04:26.365 --> 04:28.892
Hi Bob, I heard New York was good.

04:29.026 --> 04:30.981
Hi. Really good. Not so much.

04:31.545 --> 04:33.641
I bought a present for Glenn.

04:37.487 --> 04:39.051
A Christmas book?

04:39.207 --> 04:40.713
It's a scratch and sniff.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.212
Smell it.

04:47.278 --> 04:48.680
It smells like pine.

04:48.835 --> 04:51.003
Yeah, it's full of gingerbread,
orange and chocolate...

04:51.708 --> 04:53.293
I thought it would be nice.

04:53.448 --> 04:55.913
I could scratch it for him
and then he could smell it.

04:56.468 --> 04:58.130
You know... to stimulate his senses.

04:58.728 --> 05:01.780
That's awfully nice
of you, Bob. Thank you.

05:01.908 --> 05:04.732
Well, you said Christmases were
always special for you and Glenn...

05:05.547 --> 05:08.120
- They were, Bob. Thank you.
- Caroline!

05:12.478 --> 05:14.410
- Am I interrupting something?
- No...

05:15.165 --> 05:16.782
I was just...

05:17.358 --> 05:19.470
- I've got to check my e-mail.
- Well don't just run off, Bob,

05:19.635 --> 05:21.632
- I've got work for you to do.
- I'll be at my desk.

05:23.418 --> 05:25.423
Since when do
the bozos in Washington

05:25.576 --> 05:27.393
dictate the terms of
our stem cell research?

05:27.478 --> 05:29.330
They're dictating
the terms of employment

05:29.458 --> 05:31.513
of American-paid researchers, like Jill.

05:31.608 --> 05:34.111
And she can only use one
of the fifteen stem cell lines

05:34.336 --> 05:36.962
approved by Washington.
That was the agreement she signed.

05:37.168 --> 05:40.771
Okay, we're talking about a potential
treatment for juvenile diabetes, okay!

05:41.038 --> 05:44.033
- Tens of thousands of lives!
- Let's just figure a way out of it.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.783
Washington covers 70% of
our operating budget.

05:47.027 --> 05:49.823
Maybe it's time to find somebody
else to cover our operating budget.

05:50.105 --> 05:52.063
- Can you sign here?
- Okay, thanks Wes.

05:52.155 --> 05:54.113
Your conference call
is set to start in 10 minutes.

05:54.538 --> 05:57.950
I  have to spin this for a
bunch of Bible thumping Senators.

05:58.106 --> 06:01.271
- It's what you do best.
- Yeah, well, you're the head Scientist, so...

06:01.605 --> 06:04.613
- give me some ammunition.
- Okay. Bible thumpers, huh?

06:05.397 --> 06:07.453
Okay, here it is...

06:08.538 --> 06:11.751
Our American researcher,
Jill Langston, is on the verge

06:11.925 --> 06:15.382
of a major breakthrough towards
finding a cure to juvenile diabetes.

06:15.517 --> 06:18.911
She's managed to differentiate pancreatic
cells using the approved stem cell line.

06:19.006 --> 06:20.601
- It's totally kosher.
- Okay, what about

06:20.707 --> 06:22.620
the South Korean stem cell line?

06:24.227 --> 06:25.933
Jill never touched it.

06:26.097 --> 06:29.550
Her lab assistant,
who is not an American citizen,

06:29.645 --> 06:31.750
used the unapproved stem cell line

06:31.905 --> 06:34.870
to generate supernatant nutrients
that kept Jill's

06:35.067 --> 06:36.950
pancreatic cells alive.

06:37.115 --> 06:40.750
And she had nothing to do
with generating those nutrients?

06:40.955 --> 06:42.071
Nothing.

06:42.425 --> 06:43.650
Mostly.

06:46.786 --> 06:48.902
- Morning.
- Hey.

06:49.458 --> 06:51.370
Just in case anyone asks

06:51.478 --> 06:54.541
you only worked with
U.S. approved stem cell lines.

06:55.868 --> 06:58.410
- That's not entirely true.
- It is now.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.062
Who are you?

07:00.845 --> 07:01.963
J ona.

07:02.166 --> 07:04.500
We haven't met.
I'm David. I'm in charge.

07:05.928 --> 07:08.930
You generated the supernatants
using the South Korean line.

07:09.258 --> 07:11.681
I know, we're a team here.
We all work together.

07:11.846 --> 07:14.612
- But this one is all yours, Okay?
- David, what about lab books?

07:14.796 --> 07:17.763
Oh yeah. Yeah, make sure
your lab books back that up.

07:17.885 --> 07:20.353
- You want us to rewrite our lab books?
- No.

07:20.515 --> 07:25.393
No. No, I just want you
to fix any mistakes.

07:26.648 --> 07:27.920
Fuck.

07:29.005 --> 07:30.430
Fuck! Fuck!!

07:31.847 --> 07:35.062
<i>David, we are waiting for you
in the Conference Room.</i>

07:40.277 --> 07:43.261
Okay, from the New York subway.
Sunshine Davis age 15.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.703
Billy Connett age 41.

07:45.826 --> 07:49.333
St. Mike's hematology ran every
test that you asked for David.

07:49.638 --> 07:52.411
There was nothing in their
blood to suggest any known disease.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.633
No disorder.
Absolutely no infection.

07:55.015 --> 07:58.043
- Virology?
- No viruses. No bacteria.

07:58.328 --> 08:01.513
- Sorry. Sorry I'm late.
- What have you got?

08:01.705 --> 08:04.653
I ran the symptoms against
every neurological database.

08:04.808 --> 08:09.070
Best I could come up with was a
Syndrome called Lesch-Nyhan Disease.

08:09.247 --> 08:11.730
Okay, but I don't think
it could be Lesch-Nyhan.

08:11.886 --> 08:13.462
- I agree.
- Why not?

08:13.575 --> 08:16.421
Well, according to the database,
there are similarities

08:16.556 --> 08:20.762
of symptoms: spasticity, self-destructive
behaviour, biting of the hands and lips--

08:21.017 --> 08:22.641
But Lesch-Nyhan is a childhood disorder.

08:22.778 --> 08:25.760
You're born with renal failure.
Rarely survive into adolescence.

08:25.917 --> 08:28.010
- You guys done?
- One more thing.

08:28.255 --> 08:30.393
Girls are asymptomatic carriers.

08:30.721 --> 08:33.736
- Only boys get it.
- And the disease is purely genetic.

08:34.434 --> 08:36.740
Maybe not.
Sometimes unbearable suffering

08:36.844 --> 08:41.865
can only be alleviated by inflicting
greater pain through self-injury.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.750
Okay, let's see what we can find
in the environmental samples,

08:44.908 --> 08:46.700
cross reference to the blood.
We've got water,

08:46.796 --> 08:49.113
air, wall scrapings,
and one dead rat. Male.

08:49.316 --> 08:51.382
-  Me.
- Attaboy, Bob. Carlos,

08:51.567 --> 08:54.090
you and I will do standard
toxicity tests on the rest.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.940
- Gas chromatograph and mass spec.
- ASAP.

09:22.488 --> 09:24.612
<i>The North American Biotechnology Commission</i>

09:24.695 --> 09:26.863
<i>is once again in
a storm of controversy</i>

09:26.957 --> 09:28.663
<i>this time over
stem cell research.</i>

09:28.708 --> 09:31.081
<i>Last year NorBAC was
the site of a shooting...</i>

09:36.448 --> 09:38.282
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:38.618 --> 09:40.163
You should take a break.

09:40.558 --> 09:41.883
I'm fine.

09:41.987 --> 09:44.711
Well you look exhausted.
Can I give you a ride home?

09:44.805 --> 09:46.163
No thanks.

09:46.907 --> 09:49.472
- Are you gonna stop soon?
- What?

09:49.795 --> 09:51.630
Stop working soon.

09:52.428 --> 09:53.581
I can't.

09:55.276 --> 09:56.622
I messed up.

09:56.735 --> 09:59.711
And I told the diabetes people
too much too soon.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.593
- Yeah.
- I haven't finished

10:01.695 --> 10:04.761
my due diligence and now I have
protesters wanting to shut me down, so...

10:05.108 --> 10:08.302
Don't worry about any of that.
You'll work it out.

10:08.826 --> 10:10.293
Not by taking a break,

10:11.328 --> 10:13.143
or going to sleep.

10:13.448 --> 10:14.923
Or talking to me.

10:17.588 --> 10:20.022
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

10:20.306 --> 10:21.912
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.293
In the water we found
nitrogen and potassium.

10:46.655 --> 10:48.461
What about you, Carlos?

10:48.697 --> 10:50.531
In the human blood... yes.

10:50.618 --> 10:51.960
What about the molds you found?

10:52.097 --> 10:54.371
Wouldn't cause anything
but a bad set of allergies.

10:54.517 --> 10:58.100
We also found trace amounts
of fecal coliform in the water.

10:58.217 --> 11:01.202
- And in the air.
- Makes sense down there.

11:01.507 --> 11:03.501
Did you do a full run
on the air sample?

11:03.546 --> 11:05.800
Yeah. I found high levels
of carbon monoxide and

11:05.845 --> 11:08.513
carbon dioxide. And also Cymoxanil,

11:08.597 --> 11:10.841
Fungicide and Pymetrozine.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.642
- What?
- Herbicides.

11:13.836 --> 11:16.013
All right.
What about your rat?

11:16.106 --> 11:18.852
Died of old age.
He was about three.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.351
But, we found
formaldehyde in his liver.

11:24.737 --> 11:28.031
Okay. So what is it?
Is it Nitrogen? Potassium? Molds?

11:28.118 --> 11:31.150
Phosphate? Fecal coliform?
Herbicide? Fungicides?

11:31.366 --> 11:34.161
Formaldehyde?
None of the above? All of the above?

11:36.785 --> 11:39.002
Lesch-Nyhan disease.

11:39.635 --> 11:41.952
What is killing these people?

11:42.156 --> 11:44.810
What is going on down in that subway?

11:53.256 --> 11:55.630
History of Hwang Shin Yong's
stem cell lab at the National

11:55.856 --> 11:58.511
University in Seoul.
Background on the line you've been using.

11:59.015 --> 12:01.153
South Korean certification,

12:01.266 --> 12:03.591
- all the publications.
- Can you get it to me on a disc?

12:04.568 --> 12:06.311
Amazing.

12:06.408 --> 12:07.720
It'd be great if I could get

12:07.827 --> 12:09.420
a list of all of the
research teams worldwide

12:09.575 --> 12:11.031
that are using the Korean stem cell line.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.901
I can do that for you.

12:13.326 --> 12:17.490
Really? I mean that's not exactly your job.

12:17.955 --> 12:20.691
My job is to do whatever
Caroline tells me and right now

12:20.817 --> 12:23.781
she's telling me that this stem
cell mess could bury us.

12:24.136 --> 12:26.560
Okay. Thanks for your support.

12:34.758 --> 12:37.042
All right, where do you find nitrogen?

12:37.126 --> 12:40.232
- Foods, fertilizers, explosives.
- Potassium?

12:40.527 --> 12:44.223
- Food. Plant growth. Mining?
- Molds.

12:57.065 --> 12:59.850
Well, there's phosphates in detergents.

12:59.937 --> 13:01.563
And in fertilizers.

13:02.607 --> 13:05.372
Nitrogen, potassium and phosphates.

13:05.638 --> 13:08.030
The three components of fertilizers!

13:08.477 --> 13:10.282
You might have something there.

13:10.386 --> 13:13.242
Farmers use formaldehyde
to sterilize the soil.

13:13.397 --> 13:16.871
It kills weeds,
insect eggs - molds, fungi.

13:17.935 --> 13:20.750
That doesn't make sense.
Why would there be a farm in the subway?

13:20.897 --> 13:22.541
Why would someone want to grow
something in a subway?

13:23.036 --> 13:26.930
Because you wouldn't want anyone
to know what you were growing.

13:28.425 --> 13:31.573
Marijuana. Psilocybin
Mushrooms. Opium...

13:32.406 --> 13:34.602
They got a grow up down there.

13:34.775 --> 13:36.633
Okay, so let's go with that for now.

13:36.706 --> 13:38.722
We still don't know
what's making people sick.

13:38.775 --> 13:40.851
- What's the only thing we haven't checked?
- What's that?

13:40.898 --> 13:42.842
What they're growing.

13:44.526 --> 13:48.231
Owen, I can't believe it. You actually
answered your phone. David Sandstrom calling.

13:48.537 --> 13:51.463
You went dark on me there
for a while. How you doing?

13:51.657 --> 13:54.210
I'm okay. Two more
people are sick, though.

13:54.356 --> 13:56.193
Biting their fingers, and...

13:56.365 --> 13:58.603
- shaking a lot.
- What are you growing down there?

14:01.085 --> 14:03.633
How close would I be
if I guessed marijuana?

14:06.567 --> 14:08.643
The silence of
"You guessed right."

14:08.748 --> 14:11.173
Listen Owen. We think it's the
weed that's making people sick.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.212
Sunshine never smoked chronic.

14:13.317 --> 14:15.701
Really? Sunshine never smoked it.

14:18.475 --> 14:20.463
Hang on, Owen. We're thinking.

14:25.497 --> 14:26.563
Esters.

14:26.685 --> 14:28.351
- What?
- All plants give off esters.

14:28.476 --> 14:31.140
You know the aroma in flowers,
I use them in my perfumes.

14:31.896 --> 14:33.790
You think esters can
trigger something specific

14:33.946 --> 14:36.033
- in certain people.
- It's possible.

14:36.238 --> 14:39.501
It's all we've got.
Owen, we think it's in the air.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.790
Now listen. I got a friend,
he's got a lab at Columbia,

14:41.946 --> 14:44.980
- I want you to bring him some leaves.
- That's pretty far, man.

14:45.266 --> 14:46.920
You want to pay for my cab?

14:47.576 --> 14:50.300
You live in the subway, Owen, it's free.

15:03.837 --> 15:05.252
Here's a list of the labs using

15:05.386 --> 15:08.260
your  South Korean stem cell line
for disease related gene therapy.

15:10.555 --> 15:12.001
There's lots of work on cancer.

15:12.186 --> 15:13.641
There's only a few publications so far.

15:13.798 --> 15:15.500
Most of the research is still
in the pipeline.

15:16.127 --> 15:19.663
Okay, Wes, Tell me the truth.
How much time do I have to finish my work?

15:19.995 --> 15:21.353
The  clock's ticking.

15:38.107 --> 15:40.330
<i>David darling,
I know you're very busy,</i>

15:40.428 --> 15:43.531
<i>but can you please call me when you have
a minute. It's about your father.</i>

15:43.828 --> 15:46.140
<i>Beautiful day in Vancouver.
Love you.</i>

15:47.936 --> 15:49.091
What?

15:49.365 --> 15:50.800
<i>Hey David,</i>

15:50.886 --> 15:54.401
<i> it's Yasmin Sharif
from the Singapore Symposium, remember?</i>

15:54.886 --> 15:57.532
<i>- Hey Yaz!
- You remember?</i>

15:57.916 --> 16:00.911
<i>- Yeah, I remember. How are you?
- I gave a talk in Paris.</i>

16:00.995 --> 16:03.162
<i>Now I'm over-nighting
on my way to the Salk.</i>

16:03.555 --> 16:05.372
<i>Are you free for dinner?</i>

16:05.997 --> 16:09.901
You know, I was just thinking:
what am I gonna eat for dinner?

16:11.028 --> 16:13.141
Glenn, I brought you a present.

16:15.637 --> 16:17.512
Christmas Wishes.

16:17.876 --> 16:19.922
It's a scratch and sniff book.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.102
Christmas tree.

16:27.606 --> 16:29.161
Hum. Yeah.

16:31.195 --> 16:32.863
Glenn, I have this theory:

16:33.256 --> 16:35.900
I needed if you exercise
your muscles with your mind,

16:35.987 --> 16:38.400
it maybe work in
the opposite direction

16:38.445 --> 16:40.661
and your muscles will make
your mind stronger.

16:40.748 --> 16:43.371
So, we're going to go
for a jog in Central Park.

16:45.026 --> 16:46.330
Ready?

16:46.586 --> 16:47.761
Okay.

16:49.435 --> 16:51.243
It's a beautiful winter morning, Glenn.

16:51.697 --> 16:54.792
We're jogging down a path
through a snowy cedar forest.

16:55.505 --> 16:57.613
You look up through the boughs,

16:58.095 --> 17:00.663
it's like a fragrant white veil.

17:03.595 --> 17:05.991
Hey, look at that, a beautiful woman,

17:06.627 --> 17:09.063
I think she smiled at you, Glenn.

17:12.837 --> 17:14.810
We're heading up hill now,

17:15.377 --> 17:17.490
and just when
we're about to get to the top

17:17.734 --> 17:20.130
we can almost see the Waldorf Plaza.

17:20.386 --> 17:22.472
It's snowing really lightly,

17:22.617 --> 17:25.141
and the wind's really hitting your face.

17:32.206 --> 17:34.141
Oh, no, no, no. Shit!

17:35.516 --> 17:36.792
Damn it!

17:38.286 --> 17:39.281
You okay?

17:39.596 --> 17:41.931
Reverse transcriptase DNA sequences?

17:42.286 --> 17:43.771
What does that mean?

17:43.997 --> 17:46.872
It looks like these stem cells
are contaminated with a retrovirus.

17:47.385 --> 17:48.711
How'd that happen?

17:48.797 --> 17:50.063
I don't know.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.752
The line has been checked and
re-checked for viruses

17:53.857 --> 17:56.012
and retro-viruses
by labs all over the world.

17:56.286 --> 17:58.973
You're exhausted, Jill. Go home.

17:59.588 --> 18:01.223
Jona. Uh...

18:01.305 --> 18:03.352
I want you to remake and
sterilize all the buffers

18:03.437 --> 18:05.221
and then I'm going
to thaw a fresh batch of cells.

18:05.555 --> 18:07.213
- Jill go home.
- Wes please.

18:07.466 --> 18:08.731
Go away.

18:18.507 --> 18:20.351
You're amazing.

18:20.565 --> 18:23.552
And here all this time I thought
you were a mere brilliant scientist.

18:23.595 --> 18:24.923
You finished it.

18:25.075 --> 18:27.720
- Yeah, totally. It reads like the wind.
- Get out.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.291
I'm serious, Yaz.
It's really really good.

18:30.896 --> 18:33.021
A memoir.
Where did this come from?

18:33.675 --> 18:36.993
I've always wanted to write.
My parents were getting old.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.133
Just seemed like the right time

18:40.238 --> 18:42.593
to record their stories
before they got lost.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.132
I could never do this.

18:47.666 --> 18:48.662
Why?

18:48.746 --> 18:51.251
Well it'd be five pages long,
to start with.

18:51.717 --> 18:55.313
My mother was an orphan, so
they're silence on that side of the family.

18:55.918 --> 18:58.543
My dad is Swedish.
That's major silence.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.322
I was an only child.

19:02.568 --> 19:05.622
Everybody else's family
always seemed like a big...

19:06.658 --> 19:08.351
brass band.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.951
- Hmm.
- What?

19:29.035 --> 19:30.293
I dunno...

19:30.707 --> 19:32.581
- I rush things.
- No, No.

19:32.668 --> 19:34.071
It's not you.

19:36.006 --> 19:38.060
Let's take it nice and slow.

19:38.518 --> 19:39.590
Okay.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.182
Excuse me.

19:56.435 --> 19:57.440
Hey.

19:58.377 --> 20:01.323
I think the South Korean stem
cell line is producing a retrovirus.

20:01.838 --> 20:02.880
What?

20:04.668 --> 20:08.430
No... that line has been
in circulation for 18 months.

20:08.537 --> 20:11.241
There's teams all over the world using it.
They would have seen that by now.

20:11.325 --> 20:13.331
- Just redo it.
- He did.

20:13.477 --> 20:16.763
- Do it again.
- He did, and I did, and I will.

20:18.088 --> 20:20.033
- But I'm crashing.
- Okay, okay.

20:20.318 --> 20:23.883
That's all right, do it again tomorrow.
And right now go home and crash.

20:24.358 --> 20:27.342
- I can't.
- You want a sleeping pill?

20:27.476 --> 20:30.080
No. I can't go home.

20:30.567 --> 20:31.623
Why?

20:31.905 --> 20:33.812
My apartment's been flooded.

20:34.385 --> 20:37.240
My landlords live upstairs and
their toilet flooded into my bedroom.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.952
All my clothes are all trashed.
And they're claiming

20:40.037 --> 20:42.163
that  their insurance isn't cooperating,
they want me to stay in a motel!

20:42.275 --> 20:43.453
Stay here.

20:45.937 --> 20:48.791
- Really?
- Yeah, of course. Why not?

20:49.825 --> 20:52.541
- I just... I'm not...
- Hey. Hey.

20:52.855 --> 20:55.030
You need a place to stay,
I got plenty of room.

20:55.385 --> 20:57.372
Come in, you can sleep
in Lilith's room.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.542
Thank you.

21:00.648 --> 21:02.000
Oh. Hey. Hey.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.430
- Oh, oh, Christ, I'm sorry.
- What?

21:05.605 --> 21:08.090
- I have an early flight, David.
- No. Okay, now wait a minute.

21:08.177 --> 21:09.781
You know what I should
actually probably just get back to the lab.

21:09.946 --> 21:12.450
- Thanks for the read, I really appreciate it.
- Okay, now You're both talking at the same...

21:12.587 --> 21:15.462
- ... see you tomorrow. It was nice to meet you.
- Bye. Bye.

21:15.585 --> 21:17.220
Uh... Bye.

21:28.728 --> 21:30.831
- Who was that?
- That was a friend.

21:30.997 --> 21:33.223
Just a friend. Come in.

21:34.495 --> 21:37.160
Lilith's bed is in Lilith's room.

21:37.707 --> 21:39.960
Which is right over there. Go.

21:40.617 --> 21:41.940
Thank you.

21:54.257 --> 21:57.711
- Jill, you still here?
- Yeah, I'm just leaving.

21:57.915 --> 22:01.482
Yeah! Guess we should
talk about New York, eh?

22:01.945 --> 22:03.461
I mean...

22:04.517 --> 22:06.240
Did it seem different to you?

22:07.115 --> 22:08.752
I mean, this time...

22:09.715 --> 22:13.660
You know, like,
between you and me?

22:18.048 --> 22:19.231
Jill?

22:35.198 --> 22:38.663
Your friend at Columbia had his lab up
all night sequencing the marijuana DNA.

22:38.855 --> 22:40.752
- I got some thoughts.
- Okay, Just give me a second.

22:43.176 --> 22:44.942
You sort out the retrovirus scare?

22:45.195 --> 22:46.800
It's not a scare.

22:47.247 --> 22:49.720
We redid the test with a new batch.
Got the same result.

22:49.877 --> 22:52.581
My South Korean supernatant is
laced with reverse transcriptase.

22:52.708 --> 22:54.330
You checked your equipment
for contaminates?

22:54.417 --> 22:55.353
Yes, three times.

22:56.718 --> 22:59.713
I want you to send some frozen
stem cells over to Jim Prall's lab.

22:59.885 --> 23:02.340
- See what he comes up with.
- You think I missed something?

23:02.596 --> 23:05.882
No, I think this is too important
not to get a second opinion. Yes?

23:06.386 --> 23:07.370
Yeah.

23:09.808 --> 23:12.973
Okay. So this is the gene sequence
of some of the marijuana sample.

23:13.096 --> 23:16.163
Now, we found biosynthetic genes
inserted into the genome.

23:16.355 --> 23:18.162
- See, right there.
- It's been engineered?

23:18.395 --> 23:21.841
Yeah. In fact, it looks
like this strain's been

23:22.026 --> 23:25.070
developed to enhance the THC
content of medicinal marijuana.

23:25.327 --> 23:26.501
Where did you get these?

23:26.685 --> 23:29.383
Courtesy of the Vancouver
Hydroponic Growers Association.

23:29.558 --> 23:31.163
The Hydroponic Growers Association ?

23:31.636 --> 23:34.652
Marijuana is Canada's fourth biggest cash crop.

23:34.858 --> 23:36.250
- Really?
- Believe it.

23:36.338 --> 23:39.140
- Wheat, canola, corn--
- Marijuana.

23:39.808 --> 23:41.961
Okay. Where's the stuff
from the subway come from?

23:42.008 --> 23:45.362
Originally?
A bio-genetics lab in Melbourne.

23:46.756 --> 23:47.910
Look at this.

23:48.498 --> 23:50.190
The extra THC producing genes

23:50.347 --> 23:52.802
they've popped up in
at least 15 places in the genome.

23:52.936 --> 23:55.821
- An incredibly modified strain.
- You get Franken-dope.

24:05.026 --> 24:07.561
So Lesch-Nyhan

24:07.888 --> 24:10.433
is characterized by abnormal
functioning of neurotransmitters,

24:10.536 --> 24:12.443
but this can't be Lesch-Nyhan
because that's...

24:13.166 --> 24:15.451
a genetic disorder. But...

24:16.098 --> 24:18.830
we need to find out if the compounds

24:18.875 --> 24:22.391
in this modified plant can cause
Lesch-Nyhan-like symptoms?

24:22.837 --> 24:25.753
Because maybe you can
be genetically predisposed

24:25.907 --> 24:27.461
for total reefer madness.

24:33.385 --> 24:34.541
David.

24:34.805 --> 24:36.643
We're pretty sure it's the weed.

24:36.817 --> 24:38.601
Dude, I can't get rid of it, it's not mine.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.810
Well look, just move your people
out of the subway then

24:40.915 --> 24:42.523
until we do more tests, okay?

24:42.605 --> 24:44.612
Dude, subway is where we live.

24:44.696 --> 24:47.401
Then move them to a different line, Owen.

24:47.487 --> 24:50.153
I hear the IRT is lovely
this time of year.

24:51.786 --> 24:53.862
It's the people or the pot, Owen.

24:54.577 --> 24:57.110
This close to a breakthrough
for diabetes research.

24:57.697 --> 25:01.060
There are thousands of
retroviruses in human DNA,

25:01.257 --> 25:05.131
fragments of stuff that goes back to
when we crawled out of the primordial muck.

25:05.178 --> 25:07.321
99% of it is dormant and harmless.

25:07.546 --> 25:09.910
Then why is
this retrovirus such a big deal?

25:10.108 --> 25:12.202
Because we found
reverse transcriptase activity.

25:13.107 --> 25:15.490
The retrovirus isn't dormant anymore.
It woke up.

25:15.607 --> 25:16.882
It's replicating itself.

25:17.065 --> 25:18.272
The virus is active.

25:18.498 --> 25:20.780
Okay, what kind of virus
are we talking about?

25:20.968 --> 25:23.812
Don't know. Could give you
the sniffles, could be the next AIDS.

25:24.346 --> 25:26.021
Research teams all over the world

25:26.115 --> 25:27.942
have been using this stem cell line.
I mean,

25:27.985 --> 25:30.081
if it's corrupted then
cures for all kinds of diseases

25:30.165 --> 25:31.842
could be pushed years down the track.

25:31.916 --> 25:33.702
Then pull the stem cell line.

25:33.838 --> 25:37.342
No. You can't tell a researcher
in Europe to throw away

25:37.427 --> 25:41.081
10 years of her work on
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

25:41.225 --> 25:44.420
She's going to want to know why and as a
scientist I'm going to want to give her that answer.

25:44.505 --> 25:46.292
Not some song and dance
to cover my ass.

25:46.396 --> 25:48.530
We need to figure out what's
going on here before we let this out.

25:48.688 --> 25:49.682
Okay. I got it.

25:51.837 --> 25:54.631
- Jill, as soon as you find anything out, let me know.
- Of course.

25:57.018 --> 25:59.393
My mom. She never calls me on my cell.

25:59.968 --> 26:01.021
Hey.

26:02.196 --> 26:04.523
Oh, hi Dad. Hang on a second.
We done here?

26:04.808 --> 26:05.683
Yeah.

26:06.638 --> 26:08.062
Ah. What's up?

26:08.156 --> 26:09.822
Things are not so good, David.

26:10.147 --> 26:11.762
I've been looking
for your phone number all day.

26:11.998 --> 26:13.653
Mum's got it written on the fridge, Dad.

26:13.876 --> 26:16.841
- She's not here anymore, David.
- What do you mean?

26:18.865 --> 26:20.752
<i>Your mother...</i>

26:22.907 --> 26:24.502
<i>...she died yesterday.</i>

26:36.285 --> 26:37.971
- David, you got a sec?
- Yeah.

26:38.835 --> 26:40.121
Okay, so we're thinking

26:40.247 --> 26:42.931
that chemical signals
from the hybrid marijuana plants

26:42.976 --> 26:45.593
produces an ester that disables
the HPRT enzyme.

26:45.767 --> 26:47.451
The trigger could easily be chemical.

26:47.577 --> 26:49.822
It's not genetic.
But the result is the same...

26:50.077 --> 26:52.091
Without the HPRT enzyme doing its job,

26:52.296 --> 26:55.011
poisons build up in the system
and you develop the disease.

26:55.295 --> 26:57.053
You get Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

26:58.536 --> 26:59.532
Wow...

26:59.688 --> 27:01.611
Well, that's it then.

27:02.236 --> 27:04.372
I'll call Owen and let him know.

27:06.117 --> 27:08.071
David, are you OK?

27:10.487 --> 27:11.543
Yeah.

27:12.547 --> 27:16.182
I'm going to have to go to
Vancouver for a few days. But uh...

27:21.168 --> 27:22.630
What is it, David?

27:22.696 --> 27:24.733
Ah, it's... Family matter.

27:24.856 --> 27:26.041
Who died?

27:29.465 --> 27:30.772
My mom.

27:31.168 --> 27:32.461
Lydia.

27:33.576 --> 27:35.120
I'm sorry, David.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.911
Are you okay?

27:41.775 --> 27:44.751
Look, don't tell anybody, okay? Just, uh...

27:45.038 --> 27:47.493
You can tell Mayko.
I mean, she'd want to know.

27:47.577 --> 27:49.513
She met Lydia.
Don't tell Caroline.

27:50.806 --> 27:53.123
Fuck, you know what,
you should probably tell Caroline.

27:53.227 --> 27:55.630
Otherwise she'll think
I fucked off to China again.

27:57.965 --> 27:59.903
You can tell Jill, I guess.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.492
I've got to go.

28:04.137 --> 28:05.603
I've got to go.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.092
- Have a safe trip.
- Thanks.

28:12.205 --> 28:13.931
- Call if you need anything.
- Yeah.

28:15.625 --> 28:17.991
- Did you hear about this thing in Florida?
- No.

28:18.045 --> 28:20.531
There's some kind of
superbacterium attacking citrus crops.

28:20.676 --> 28:23.520
- Put Bob on it.
- Bob's not going to go to Florida by himself.

28:23.678 --> 28:25.340
Then you go, Wes.

29:19.235 --> 29:21.121
Hey Lil. It's me.

29:22.298 --> 29:23.663
How are you?

29:24.096 --> 29:26.630
Where are you, I should say.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.223
I'm sorry to leave a message
like this on your cell phone

29:29.368 --> 29:32.252
but I've got to catch a plane
in a few hours, so I...

29:34.227 --> 29:37.010
Well, I just... I thought you
should know that your...

29:38.285 --> 29:40.062
...grandma passed away.

29:41.965 --> 29:43.850
yesterday.

29:46.446 --> 29:47.851
Sorry pal.

30:20.005 --> 30:22.600
<i>Don't be sad, David, darling.</i>

30:25.125 --> 30:27.261
Everything that lives must die.

30:28.126 --> 30:30.640
Pants isn't even two, mum.

30:30.748 --> 30:32.271
It was her time to go.

30:32.376 --> 30:33.373
No!

30:36.277 --> 30:37.111
Shush.

30:37.317 --> 30:38.882
I've read the books, mum!

30:39.105 --> 30:41.082
Guinea pigs live four to six years.

30:41.267 --> 30:43.830
Pants died because dad put
her cage on the porch.

30:45.588 --> 30:47.612
Your father has allergies sweatie.

30:47.707 --> 30:50.653
I want a dog but I can't
have a dog so I get a guinea pig

30:50.807 --> 30:52.980
and he puts her out
and the temperature goes down...

30:53.838 --> 30:55.201
David, David, David...

30:55.527 --> 30:57.241
She died of pneumonia, mum.

30:57.377 --> 30:59.171
She had all the symptoms
from the book;

30:59.348 --> 31:01.481
rapid breathing,
runny eyes, lethargy--

31:01.677 --> 31:02.863
David.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.393
She got cold, it weakened her,

31:05.495 --> 31:07.441
then she got a bacterial infection.

31:07.635 --> 31:08.892
It's not fair.

31:11.356 --> 31:12.413
I know.

31:13.348 --> 31:15.220
Where will I bury her?

31:17.448 --> 31:18.820
Well,

31:20.155 --> 31:22.390
we could bury her
in the rose garden.

31:22.515 --> 31:23.590
I loved her.

31:26.178 --> 31:27.991
Everything dies, David.

31:28.565 --> 31:30.233
It's nature's way.

31:30.368 --> 31:31.983
It's Dad's way.

31:34.088 --> 31:35.583
It's okay to be sad.

31:35.765 --> 31:37.582
Have a good cry.

31:38.056 --> 31:39.790
I don't want to cry.

31:49.868 --> 31:51.522
<i>Gimme the bad news, Caroline.</i>

31:51.626 --> 31:53.492
I did some digging after we spoke.

31:53.746 --> 31:56.772
Our American researcher
was using an unapproved stem cell line

31:56.897 --> 31:59.510
to generate nutrients
for her pancreatic clones.

31:59.667 --> 32:00.811
How did that happen?

32:00.915 --> 32:03.351
The American researcher did her background checks

32:03.478 --> 32:05.562
on the South Korean stem cells

32:05.865 --> 32:09.183
and she found an active retrovirus.

32:09.326 --> 32:12.320
Thing is, labs all over the world
are using this stem cell line.

32:12.456 --> 32:14.991
We will eventually have
to report our findings.

32:15.258 --> 32:17.480
You're going to tell the world
that a U.S. Scientist

32:17.598 --> 32:19.900
was working
on an unapproved stem cell line?

32:20.066 --> 32:22.522
<i>Unless we go on the offensive,
not the defense.</i>

32:22.698 --> 32:23.592
What?!

32:23.746 --> 32:27.172
NorBAC finds contaminants
in an unapproved stem cell line.

32:27.325 --> 32:30.271
South Korean suppliers look bad
and, by inference, so do all

32:30.436 --> 32:33.621
the countries who sell outside
Washington's approval system!

32:33.788 --> 32:35.362
What's not to like?

32:37.456 --> 32:39.600
<i>- You are good.
- I know.</i>

32:43.287 --> 32:44.262
Well...

32:44.955 --> 32:46.083
Thank you.

32:46.596 --> 32:48.590
Identify those contaminants.

32:48.936 --> 32:51.751
Put them out there.
I'll handle the rest.

32:52.585 --> 32:54.900
I'm on it. I will. Thank you.

33:29.646 --> 33:30.892
Hey, Dad.

33:36.978 --> 33:38.220
Hey, Dad.

33:39.856 --> 33:41.283
David,

33:41.737 --> 33:45.272
It's good you could come.
I couldn't find your phone number.

33:45.846 --> 33:47.733
Yeah. How are you doing?

33:48.438 --> 33:49.722
Want a beer?

33:57.316 --> 33:58.950
So what happened, Dad?

33:59.936 --> 34:02.030
I don't know. I was in there painting.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.713
She said she was going come
in here and make my sandwich.

34:04.988 --> 34:07.290
An hour goes by.
I knew something was wrong.

34:07.498 --> 34:09.340
It doesn't take an hour
to make a sandwich.

34:09.496 --> 34:11.283
So I come in here and...

34:11.815 --> 34:15.482
there she is lying
on the floor right there.

34:17.588 --> 34:20.699
- What did Dr. Mitchell say?
- He said she was dead.

34:22.096 --> 34:24.331
She was younger than me,
don't forget.

34:25.125 --> 34:27.793
I'm the one with the
health problems, not her.

34:34.226 --> 34:36.681
She worried too much.
That's what killed her.

34:36.956 --> 34:39.721
She worried about you
all her life. That's why.

34:40.216 --> 34:41.710
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

34:41.856 --> 34:44.112
Look, are the funeral
arrangements in hand?

34:44.197 --> 34:46.071
- I left that all to them.
- Who?

34:46.208 --> 34:47.263
The funeral parlor.

34:47.408 --> 34:49.130
No, Dad, they can't do it all.

34:49.266 --> 34:50.752
We've have to choose the music,

34:50.877 --> 34:53.710
we have to figure out the order
of the service, who's going to say what.

34:53.856 --> 34:56.531
- That sort of stuff.
- I'm too tired.

34:56.667 --> 35:00.520
Alright. What's the name
of the funeral parlor? I'll do it.

35:02.847 --> 35:06.493
The minister's name is written down
by the telephone in the bedroom.

35:06.747 --> 35:07.893
Alright.

35:10.477 --> 35:12.383
Your mother didn't live as a Lutheran

35:12.568 --> 35:15.322
but it looks like
she's going to die as one.

36:17.867 --> 36:20.373
McGuinn's coming up to brief us.
All I know is,

36:20.506 --> 36:24.462
Washington is on the verge of mounting
some kind of strike on Cuban biological labs.

36:24.746 --> 36:27.272
Just because of some
infested orange groves in Florida?

36:27.388 --> 36:30.102
I don't know. I don't know.
We'll know better in a couple of days.

36:30.236 --> 36:32.793
But I have a feeling this is
going to be a priority case.

36:33.125 --> 36:34.313
Hey, Carlos.

36:34.685 --> 36:36.483
Could I have a private word
with Caroline?

36:36.835 --> 36:38.291
Yeah, sure.

36:43.237 --> 36:44.873
Hey, Bob. What's up?

36:48.056 --> 36:50.490
I think exercise might be the answer for Glenn.

36:50.785 --> 36:52.072
What do you mean?

36:52.226 --> 36:54.022
I've been taking him on runs.

36:54.765 --> 36:56.421
Runs?

36:56.585 --> 36:58.280
Well, imaginary runs.

36:58.695 --> 37:01.153
Se, I think
the mental exercise

37:01.285 --> 37:03.801
may stimulate the neural
pathways to his muscles.

37:03.957 --> 37:06.323
And because he's following
along in his head,

37:06.416 --> 37:08.333
if I tell him
we're about to jump a fence

37:08.376 --> 37:10.290
he'll tell his muscles
to jump the fence

37:10.338 --> 37:12.192
and bit by bit by bit
he'll get back in shape.

37:13.847 --> 37:15.420
When I talk to Glenn...

37:15.725 --> 37:17.230
I can feel him listening.

37:18.275 --> 37:20.020
His brain is intact, Caroline.

37:20.125 --> 37:21.980
Some of the pieces are disconnected.

37:22.745 --> 37:24.433
I think we can try...

37:25.496 --> 37:26.800
to reconnect them.

37:30.265 --> 37:31.582
Let me try.

37:34.268 --> 37:35.700
OK.

37:37.468 --> 37:39.170
Thank you, Caroline.

37:40.118 --> 37:41.190
Thank you!

37:50.486 --> 37:53.023
My mother didn't really
have a life of her own.

37:53.107 --> 37:55.273
She sort of lived for
and through other people.

37:55.366 --> 37:57.273
You know?
My father, me, my daughter.

37:57.705 --> 37:59.772
She was incredibly bright.

38:00.447 --> 38:01.902
She read widely.

38:02.576 --> 38:04.052
She wrote beautifully.

38:04.157 --> 38:06.160
She had enormous empathy
for people

38:06.276 --> 38:07.980
of all shapes and sizes.

38:08.705 --> 38:10.460
She could sing like a bird.

38:10.565 --> 38:13.313
I wish I knew her,
she sounds like a wonderful woman.

38:13.538 --> 38:17.260
Well, she spent her life making
sandwiches for a man who resented her.

38:18.857 --> 38:21.543
I gave this to her for
Christmas last year.

38:21.635 --> 38:23.543
It's full of the music
that she loved.

38:23.826 --> 38:26.282
I noted a couple of selections
for the service.

38:27.225 --> 38:30.422
Oh, and this goes with her in the...

38:31.515 --> 38:33.463
in the coffin, casket,
you know...

38:33.806 --> 38:35.780
W.H. Auden, it's her favourite poet.

38:36.827 --> 38:39.172
- And the service?
- Oh, nothing fancy.

38:41.006 --> 38:42.951
Do you want to say a few words?

38:58.736 --> 39:00.650
I'm making grilled cheese,
you want one?

39:00.748 --> 39:02.741
- What?
- Do you want a sandwich?

39:03.035 --> 39:04.663
Why would I want a sandwich?

39:04.705 --> 39:06.202
Right. Stupid question.

39:18.597 --> 39:19.671
What is this?

39:19.768 --> 39:21.230
Grilled cheese.

39:22.876 --> 39:25.440
You know, Dad, you're going to
want to get a housekeeper.

39:25.787 --> 39:27.760
- What for?
- Because you can't live like this.

39:27.905 --> 39:30.941
Well, don't look at me.
This is all your mother's business.

39:31.055 --> 39:33.261
You blame mom for the mess?

39:33.537 --> 39:34.651
I go on and on.

39:34.738 --> 39:37.270
Do this, do that.
She pays no attention,

39:37.477 --> 39:39.280
so finally I shut up about it.

39:39.976 --> 39:41.832
So be it. Have it your way.

39:42.128 --> 39:43.672
And we live like this.

39:44.156 --> 39:45.941
Don't think this
is the way I like it.

39:46.877 --> 39:48.991
You know, maybe it's time
you let her off the hook, hey.

39:49.126 --> 39:50.353
Why should I?

39:52.835 --> 39:54.601
Because she's dead, Dad.

39:59.846 --> 40:01.692
I thought
you didn't want a sandwich.

40:02.247 --> 40:04.321
You made it for me, why not?

40:08.445 --> 40:10.471
I don't like people
watching me while I eat.

40:10.627 --> 40:12.000
That's what the
television is for.

40:12.126 --> 40:13.611
Go watch television.

40:17.566 --> 40:19.653
I want to play a little
game with you, Dad.

40:20.846 --> 40:21.841
I hate games.

40:21.985 --> 40:23.252
I'm going to say five words.

40:23.355 --> 40:26.392
And after I count to five I want you
to say them back to me, okay?

40:27.266 --> 40:30.233
Poodle, knife, ball,

40:30.505 --> 40:32.901
steamboat, refrigerator.

40:34.157 --> 40:35.883
One, two, three,

40:36.086 --> 40:37.981
four, five. Go.

40:39.345 --> 40:41.421
Caniche, couteau,

40:41.467 --> 40:45.691
bateau à vapeur, balle,
réfrigérateur. Fuck you.

40:46.508 --> 40:48.343
Why are you always so angry?

40:48.475 --> 40:52.972
Pudel, kniv, bat, bal, kyl skap.
How's your Swedish?

40:53.148 --> 40:55.202
You never taught me a word.

40:55.337 --> 40:56.780
Only thing I remember about my childhood

40:56.916 --> 40:59.771
is everybody creeping around
because you were always in a bad mood.

41:00.608 --> 41:03.311
- I never get angry.
- No? Well I do. I got your temper.

41:03.466 --> 41:06.760
It's the only thing you ever
gave me. And I hate it.

41:07.758 --> 41:09.572
You should see someone.

41:12.168 --> 41:13.913
I've got to lie down.

41:14.045 --> 41:15.633
There's no time. Go get dressed.

41:15.817 --> 41:18.303
- What?
- There's a car coming for us at eleven.

41:18.418 --> 41:19.793
What car?

41:22.076 --> 41:25.553
We are burying Mom today, Dad.

41:26.568 --> 41:28.033
Well, I don't want to go.

41:28.187 --> 41:31.051
Well, you don't have
a choice in the matter. Go get dressed.

41:34.626 --> 41:38.273
You understand nothing.

41:56.426 --> 41:58.040
What's this?

41:58.285 --> 42:00.270
Calla lilies. Thank you.

42:02.878 --> 42:05.110
She liked calla lilies.

42:31.458 --> 42:34.283
Here's a story about my mom.

42:36.505 --> 42:39.771
One time, I was
about seven years old, I...

42:41.185 --> 42:43.611
I came home from school,

42:44.147 --> 42:46.460
all the lights in the house were out,

42:46.557 --> 42:48.282
which was strange because

42:48.436 --> 42:51.191
I was just learning how to walk
home from school by myself

42:51.385 --> 42:52.660
and the deal was

42:52.817 --> 42:56.711
that my mom was supposed to always
be waiting for me in the kitchen.

42:58.145 --> 43:00.781
But the house was dark and...

43:02.345 --> 43:04.072
so I started to panic.

43:05.496 --> 43:07.391
And I started calling out
her name.

43:07.538 --> 43:09.540
Not mom, like her name.

43:09.738 --> 43:11.332
Like, "Lydia! Lydia!"

43:12.806 --> 43:16.210
And I started running from room
to room looking for her.

43:16.975 --> 43:19.002
I went into the bedroom

43:19.226 --> 43:21.291
and the bed wasn't made up.

43:22.228 --> 43:24.251
I ran into the kitchen

43:24.348 --> 43:27.012
and the lunch dishes were still
on the table.

43:28.927 --> 43:30.781
I just kept calling out to her.

43:30.937 --> 43:32.601
"Lydia! Where are you?"

43:34.895 --> 43:37.131
But, just silent,

43:38.405 --> 43:41.332
except for the sound
of my heart beating.

43:43.338 --> 43:47.330
And then finally, I ran out into
the back yard and...

43:48.786 --> 43:50.300
there she was.

43:52.488 --> 43:56.500
And I know now it was probably
just the afternoon sunlight, but...

43:59.115 --> 44:01.231
she looked like she was glowing.

44:03.095 --> 44:04.752
She looked like...

44:08.116 --> 44:10.500
Well, I guess what
you figure an angel...

44:11.175 --> 44:12.391
looks like.

44:15.236 --> 44:17.082
I ran up to her,

44:18.345 --> 44:21.221
tears streaming down my face

44:22.467 --> 44:24.021
and I threw my arms around her

44:24.105 --> 44:27.511
and I locked on to her
for dear life.

44:28.895 --> 44:30.491
She laughed at me

44:31.626 --> 44:33.903
and held me tight and said:

44:34.586 --> 44:36.990
"David, what on earth is the
matter with you?"

44:38.118 --> 44:39.640
And I said...

44:46.696 --> 44:49.501
And I said: "Promise me you
will never die."

44:53.287 --> 44:54.791
And she did.

45:10.615 --> 45:12.123
Mom...

45:12.915 --> 45:15.303
I will miss you every day

45:15.947 --> 45:18.283
for the rest of my life.

45:44.435 --> 45:46.553
Come on, Dad.
I'll make you some dinner.

45:46.876 --> 45:49.040
That's your mother's job.

45:49.115 --> 45:52.121
She doesn't like anybody else
in the kitchen.

46:04.685 --> 46:06.683
Sure you don't want
any soup?

46:08.146 --> 46:09.180
No.

46:10.816 --> 46:12.391
Me neither.

46:15.107 --> 46:18.813
You know, I never understood
why my mother stayed with my father.

46:19.027 --> 46:20.731
She never told me.

46:20.947 --> 46:23.433
And I don't think he ever be
able to.

46:23.657 --> 46:26.572
Oh, I called an assited care service.

46:26.706 --> 46:28.742
And what do I need that for?

46:28.788 --> 46:32.790
Just someone to have around the house
and make things easier...

46:33.208 --> 46:34.412
...for you.

46:34.716 --> 46:37.422
I have a friend who is
in a persistent vegetative state.

46:37.507 --> 46:39.711
He's 18 now. Had a stroke while
he was running.

46:39.886 --> 46:41.381
Now, I would bet my last pound

46:41.427 --> 46:44.053
that some of those people
can hear and understand.

46:44.138 --> 46:45.761
See, that's what I think.

46:45.847 --> 46:47.891
I think he's closer to the
surface than we thought.

46:47.987 --> 46:50.143
Do you really believe Glenn could wake up?

46:51.157 --> 46:52.760
One step at a time.

46:53.606 --> 46:58.112
Salvador Charringa has over 10,000
acres of citrus groves outside Miami.

46:58.278 --> 47:00.323
The same Salvador Charringa
who openly admits

47:00.367 --> 47:02.361
he helped finance
the Bay of Pigs.

47:02.445 --> 47:06.111
This is what fifteen hundred
of those acres looked like as of last week.

47:06.207 --> 47:08.201
What are we talking about?
Agricultural terrorism?

47:08.245 --> 47:10.873
According to some experts,
Florida could be on the verge

47:11.006 --> 47:13.042
of a plague of biblical proportions.

47:13.298 --> 47:17.830
We'd like to know if
it's God's will or Fidel's?

47:20.218 --> 47:23.130
I ask Weston if I could give
a field agent a mission this week,

47:23.215 --> 47:24.721
and he said it will be alright.

47:24.765 --> 47:27.222
If you aren't already online,
take the NorBAC tour

47:27.305 --> 47:29.223
and I'll give you all the details.

47:29.268 --> 47:31.553
Remember, only you know the
whole story.
