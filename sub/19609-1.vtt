00:21.185 --> 00:24.149
Starting with a relatively simple idea,

00:24.274 --> 00:28.987
Kafka plunges us into an incoherent,
absurd and surreal world.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.031
The idea is this:

00:31.156 --> 00:35.869
Bureaucrats, the system of administration
and its power crush the individual.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.789
The individual becomes
a choking victim of society

00:38.914 --> 00:40.874
when by chance - or misfortune -

00:40.999 --> 00:44.878
he is drawn
towards the gear of its system.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.674
From an article by Louis Chauvet
(Le Figaro)

00:55.138 --> 01:01.183
THE TRIAL

01:51.111 --> 01:55.240
Before the law there stands a guard.

01:57.117 --> 02:02.206
A man comes from the country,
begging admittance to the law.

02:03.038 --> 02:05.834
But the guard cannot admit him.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.586
"Can he hope to enter at a later time?"

02:08.711 --> 02:11.340
"That is possible," says the guard.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.675
The man tries
to peer through the entrance.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.722
"He had been taught that the law
should be accessible to every man."

02:18.847 --> 02:23.227
"Do not attempt to enter
without my permission," says the guard.

02:23.352 --> 02:27.397
"I am very powerful,
yet I am the least of all the guards.

02:27.523 --> 02:30.108
"From hall to hall, door after door,

02:30.234 --> 02:33.487
"each guard
is more powerful than the last."

02:34.613 --> 02:37.616
By the guard's permission,
the man sits down by the side of the door

02:37.741 --> 02:39.785
and there he waits.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.582
For years he waits.

02:47.876 --> 02:53.173
Everything he has, he gives away
in the hope of bribing the guard,

02:53.298 --> 02:56.033
who never fails to say to him,
"I take what you give me

02:56.160 --> 03:00.130
"only so you will not feel
you have left something undone."

03:01.223 --> 03:03.970
Keeping his watch during the long years,

03:04.100 --> 03:08.972
the man has learned to know even
the fleas in the guard's fur collar.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.734
And, growing childish in old age,

03:12.860 --> 03:18.606
he begs the very fleas to persuade the guard
to change his mind and allow him to enter.

03:18.731 --> 03:22.411
His sight is dimmed, but in the darkness
he perceives a radiance

03:22.536 --> 03:25.439
streaming from the door of the law.

03:25.572 --> 03:28.041
And now, before he dies,

03:28.166 --> 03:32.420
all his experience condenses into one
question, a question he has never asked.

03:32.546 --> 03:37.551
He beckons to the guard. Says the guard,
"You are insatiable! What is it now?"

03:37.676 --> 03:42.297
Says the man,
"Every man strives to attain the law.

03:43.048 --> 03:48.311
"How is it then that in all these years
no one else has ever come here

03:48.436 --> 03:50.438
"seeking admittance?"

03:51.940 --> 03:55.360
His hearing has failed
so the guard yells into his ear.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.822
"No one else but you
could ever have obtained admittance.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.658
"No one else could enter this door.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.995
"This door was intended

04:05.120 --> 04:07.164
"only for you.

04:08.707 --> 04:12.252
"And now I am going to close it."

04:21.219 --> 04:25.640
This tale is told during this story
called "The Trial".

04:28.016 --> 04:32.188
It has been said
that the logic of this story

04:32.313 --> 04:34.482
is the logic of a dream.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.810
Of a nightmare.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.799
(Door handle rattles)

05:04.930 --> 05:06.640
Miss Burstner?

05:14.064 --> 05:16.107
You were expecting Miss Burstner?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.860
Why, no. N-No!

05:18.985 --> 05:21.404
What an idea! Of course not.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.281
You spoke her name just now.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.284
- When?
- When I came in.

05:26.409 --> 05:30.705
- You addressed me as Miss Burstner.
- Well, that's her room, you know.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.416
What, what,
what are you doing in there?

05:33.542 --> 05:35.460
W-Who are you?
What are you doing in here?

05:35.585 --> 05:38.797
Miss Burstner frequently
comes through that door in the night?

05:38.922 --> 05:42.968
No, never!
That door is kept permanently locked.

05:43.093 --> 05:46.179
Mrs Grubach keeps the key.
Just ask her.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.807
Where is she? Does she know about you?
Mrs Grubach?

05:48.932 --> 05:51.560
You were expecting Mrs Grubach?

05:51.685 --> 05:56.606
No. No. I'm not expecting anybody,
least of all you, whoever the hell you are!

05:56.731 --> 05:59.734
- Where are you going?
- Well, I...

05:59.860 --> 06:04.698
I think Mrs Grubach would like to know
there are strange people in her apartment.

06:04.823 --> 06:08.827
You were starting in that direction.
That's Miss Burstner's room.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.288
It is. I'd like to know what's going on.

06:11.413 --> 06:15.250
- She isn't there now.
- Well, that's... not so very surprising.

06:15.375 --> 06:20.046
She gets in late sometimes.
Very late. Very late indeed.

06:21.756 --> 06:25.343
- You... you are the police?
- She gets in very late?

06:25.469 --> 06:28.305
- Don't go jumping to conclusions.
- What conclusions?

06:28.430 --> 06:31.933
The hours they keep in her nightclub
are no fault of hers.

06:32.058 --> 06:36.188
She'll be home any minute now
and can answer your questions for herself.

06:37.606 --> 06:41.151
- You are the police?
- What makes you think we want her?

06:41.276 --> 06:44.654
Oh, I have no opinion of it,
one way or another.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.490
It's nothing to do with me.

06:46.615 --> 06:50.744
I scarcely know Miss Burstner.
Of course, we are fellow lodgers,

06:50.869 --> 06:55.165
but that's obvious. Is, um...
Is she in some kind of trouble?

06:55.290 --> 06:56.750
What kind of trouble?

06:56.875 --> 06:59.836
Do you imagine we came here
to see Miss Burstner?

06:59.961 --> 07:04.716
Well, you certainly didn't
come here to see me... did you?

07:07.803 --> 07:11.598
Well, listen, you don't deny anything
or affirm anything.

07:11.723 --> 07:15.769
You just stand there and stare at me
in the middle of my private bedroom at...

07:15.894 --> 07:17.896
6.14 in the morning.

07:18.814 --> 07:21.650
I don't see
why I should put up with it.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.362
- You haven't even shown me your papers.
- Isn't that for you to do?

07:25.487 --> 07:30.700
Oh, no. My papers - excuse me -
are in perfect order. Here, see for yourself.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.453
Why don't you finish getting dressed?

07:35.372 --> 07:38.500
For your information,
I am a man of regular habits

07:38.625 --> 07:42.337
and getting dressed at 6.15 in the morning
doesn't happen to be one of them.

07:42.462 --> 07:47.008
Still, I don't suppose there's any hope
of getting any more sleep.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.469
Where are you going?

07:49.594 --> 07:54.099
I take a bath in the morning,
if you must know. Why?

07:54.224 --> 07:56.309
If you're reluctant
to dress in front of me...

07:56.434 --> 07:59.187
- And I dress in the bathroom.
- Oh?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.523
- Yes.
- Why?

08:01.648 --> 08:05.152
Well, it's warm in the bathroom
and it's cold in the hall.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.320
Any more questions?

08:07.445 --> 08:10.824
- Why would you want to dress in the hall?
- Stay here.

08:10.949 --> 08:14.953
- Why get dressed out in the hall?
- I don't, I don't.

08:15.078 --> 08:19.416
But if I did not get dressed
in the bathroom after I finished my bath,

08:19.541 --> 08:23.170
I'd be obliged to walk down the draughty
hall in my silk dressing robe

08:23.295 --> 08:28.592
right after... out of a warm tub.
I hope you understand.

08:29.259 --> 08:32.011
You wanted to get dressed in the hall.
Didn't you?

08:32.136 --> 08:34.847
- No.
- OK, have it your way, mister.

08:34.972 --> 08:39.644
What do you want to get dressed up for?
You're going nowhere. You're under arrest.

08:43.315 --> 08:47.527
- You're... making a formal charge?
- I couldn't do that, mister.

08:47.652 --> 08:51.948
- Exactly what is it I'm charged with?
- Take that up with the Inspector.

08:52.073 --> 08:56.286
- That's who just left.
- "...until called for interrogation

08:56.411 --> 08:59.623
- "you retired to your room."
- I'm in my room!

08:59.748 --> 09:03.168
- You've got a lot of real nice shirts.
- Leave those shirts alone!

09:03.293 --> 09:06.797
Know something? You'd do a whole lot
better to give them things to us.

09:06.922 --> 09:11.468
After they're impounded officially,
you won't know what happens to them.

09:11.593 --> 09:15.472
- There's crookedness in public auctions.
- We're your friends.

09:15.597 --> 09:19.309
You ought to give us
some of them shirts at least.

09:19.434 --> 09:24.064
It could be a joke, I suppose.
An elaborate practical joke by my friends.

09:24.189 --> 09:28.193
- They're in there.
- Who's in there?

09:32.447 --> 09:34.616
You're from my office.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.911
Who brought you here?

09:38.703 --> 09:40.121
The police?

09:40.872 --> 09:43.500
These clerks from my office,
what have they got to do with it?

09:43.625 --> 09:48.046
Rabensteiner, Kullich and Kaminer.
Right? What's this?

09:48.171 --> 09:52.926
That's her mother.
Leave her things alone! You especially!

09:54.511 --> 09:57.472
Rabensteiner, what are you doing here?

09:57.597 --> 10:02.269
- We thought it'd be more unabusive...
- Unobstrusive.

10:02.394 --> 10:06.314
<i>Unobstruse</i> is the word
you're looking for, not unabuse.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.569
- How can I go to the office?
- This won't keep you from working.

10:10.694 --> 10:14.865
- He said I'd stay in my room.
- He was reading the wrong page.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.955
Well, this obviously isn't anything
of any importance.

10:23.165 --> 10:28.128
Quite honestly, I can't remember a single
offence that could be charged against me.

10:29.212 --> 10:32.632
It's obviously a mistake.
Something very trivial.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.849
But the real question is...

10:41.933 --> 10:43.518
who accuses me?

10:44.644 --> 10:48.732
- Well? What authority...?
- Don't you worry about that, mister!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.693
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

10:51.818 --> 10:55.322
but you won't find
any subversive literature or pornography.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.366
- Don't touch those record albums!
- What's this?

10:58.492 --> 11:01.995
- That's my pornograph... my phono...
- What's this?

11:02.120 --> 11:06.249
- What's what?
- A circular line with four holes.

11:06.374 --> 11:10.921
- No, it's not really circular. Ovular.
- Don't write that down.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.173
- Why not?
- Ovular!

11:13.298 --> 11:16.927
- We can't not write it down.
- Ovular isn't even a word.

11:17.052 --> 11:20.680
- Do you deny there's an ovular shape?
- He denies everything!

11:20.806 --> 11:25.644
Mrs Grubach's husband was a dentist.
There she is now! Mrs Grubach?

11:25.769 --> 11:27.562
Mrs Grubach.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.565
This was Dr Grubach's office.

11:30.690 --> 11:35.237
- That don't matter. She can't come in.
- The dental chair was screwed here.

11:37.405 --> 11:41.117
Do you want some good advice, mister?
I wouldn't want the others to hear it.

11:41.243 --> 11:44.287
Now you'll want money.
You've got the wrong man.

11:44.412 --> 11:48.250
- That's what they all say.
- Bribery. I don't believe in it.

11:48.375 --> 11:52.212
- Have I asked you to give me anything?
- We're leaving, mister.

11:52.337 --> 11:55.257
You're not going to be
one of them troublemakers, are you?

11:56.466 --> 11:59.970
- Mrs Grubach?
- Good morning, Mr K. Breakfast is ready.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.972
Ma'am, I wish you'd tell him.

12:02.097 --> 12:06.685
If he really doesn't think that he's guilty,
he should keep it to himself.

12:06.810 --> 12:10.147
At this stage,
this makes a very lousy impression.

12:25.662 --> 12:29.124
- I'm afraid I owe you an apology.
- Oh, no, Mr K.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.966
This is not going to happen again,
I can promise you that.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.802
A lot of things happen in this world,
Mr K.

12:40.927 --> 12:45.056
- Yes.
- You're my most valued lodger, Mr K.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.603
- I think I owe it to you to be frank.
- By all means.

12:49.728 --> 12:55.025
For your own good. I really have that
at heart, perhaps more than I should.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.777
After all, I'm only your landlady.

12:59.738 --> 13:04.451
Well... I managed to have a few words
alone with that Inspector.

13:04.576 --> 13:05.619
And?

13:05.744 --> 13:10.373
- It seems you are under arrest, Mr K.
- Yes, I know that.

13:10.499 --> 13:13.919
But not the way a thief's put under arrest.

13:14.044 --> 13:19.090
No, with your arrest,
I get the feeling of something abstract.

13:19.216 --> 13:22.302
It's so abstract,
I can't consider how it applies to me!

13:22.427 --> 13:26.348
Of course not, Mr K.
Aren't you going to eat something?

13:26.473 --> 13:30.977
Coming into my room the way they did.
I simply wasn't prepared.

13:31.102 --> 13:34.648
Now in the office, for instance,
I'm always prepared.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.484
You can't just crash in on me there.

13:37.609 --> 13:42.322
People sometimes have to wait for weeks
even to speak to my secretary!

13:42.447 --> 13:44.366
No, my mistake

13:44.491 --> 13:48.495
was letting them start in on me
before I even had a cup of coffee.

13:48.620 --> 13:53.500
Coffee is always ready on the stove, Mr K.
I keep it there for Miss Burstner

13:53.625 --> 13:57.420
when she gets in from work.
Such ungodly hours she keeps.

13:57.546 --> 14:01.174
- Well, that's her profession.
- I suppose so.

14:01.299 --> 14:05.387
- The hours they keep are not her fault.
- Perhaps not.

14:05.512 --> 14:09.516
Do you think
I ought to offer those men some coffee?

14:09.641 --> 14:13.478
- What men?
- The ones from your office. In there.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.231
In Miss Burstner's bedroom?!

14:18.108 --> 14:22.028
My God, I thought you'd left.
What are you doing here?

14:23.822 --> 14:27.075
Rabensteiner! Put those pictures back
where you found them!

14:27.200 --> 14:29.494
- Here's some coffee for the gentlemen.
- No!

14:29.619 --> 14:32.914
These people are not friends of mine.
They came with the police.

14:33.039 --> 14:37.335
- Please show them to the door.
- Yes, Mr K. This way, gentlemen.

14:37.461 --> 14:40.672
What are you anyway? Informers?

14:42.966 --> 14:44.968
What would you have to inform about?

14:49.681 --> 14:53.393
- You're still here!
- You're attracting attention, Mr K.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.189
Attracting attention.

14:57.314 --> 15:00.692
I'd appreciate the return
of my identification papers, please.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.862
You seriously think
that we don't know who you are?

15:03.987 --> 15:07.574
Really, Mr K.
You're not doing your case any good.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.994
- What is this case you're talking about?
- I'm not talking about it.

15:11.119 --> 15:16.500
- Why not? Why don't you talk about it?
- It's not for me to talk about your case.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.044
- Inspector...
- Yes?

15:22.380 --> 15:24.382
What's the charge?

15:24.508 --> 15:27.886
Mr K,
you aren't claiming innocence, are you?

15:29.846 --> 15:31.431
Naturally.

15:32.224 --> 15:36.520
I'm also claiming invasion of privacy
and rank abuse of basic civil rights.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.648
- Hold on...
- I don't know the legal terminology,

15:39.773 --> 15:44.611
but I can get a lawyer to help with that.
A well-known advocate is a family friend.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.948
- You aren't threatening a complaint?
- Yes, I am, I am!

15:48.073 --> 15:51.451
And a rather clumsy attempt
to work me for a bribe.

15:51.576 --> 15:55.247
There she comes.
Your friend, Miss Burstner.

15:56.331 --> 15:59.626
Well, she's not exactly my friend,
not that it's any business of yours.

15:59.751 --> 16:03.588
Are you going to stay all morning?
Take fingerprints?

16:03.713 --> 16:06.049
- We can do that at the station.
- Station?

16:06.174 --> 16:08.802
Where else could you register
an official complaint?

16:10.178 --> 16:13.765
- We can forget about that.
- It's on the record.

16:13.890 --> 16:18.061
- You did use the word "threatening".
- No, that was your word.

16:18.186 --> 16:22.190
- What's this pornograph?
- Don't try to make anything from that!

16:22.315 --> 16:24.568
- Not unless you have a dirty mind.
- Excuse me.

16:24.693 --> 16:29.698
- No, no, y-you stay, Mrs Grubach.
- None of this will show up very well.

16:29.823 --> 16:33.827
My men say you even tried to stop them
from putting this down.

16:33.952 --> 16:37.581
I tried to stop one from making
a fool of himself. Ovular.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.500
- Ovular.
- There's no such word.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.963
Mrs Grubach's husband was a dentist.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.633
Now what's that got to do with your case?

16:49.468 --> 16:52.345
- I never said that it did.
- Then why mention such a thing?

16:52.471 --> 16:55.724
Simply by way of explaining that ovular...

16:55.849 --> 16:57.893
Ovular shape.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.814
You go on solemnly writing it all down.

17:02.939 --> 17:06.984
There has to be a record, doesn't there?
But this foolish babbling,

17:07.109 --> 17:11.114
it's not going to make much of
an impression, I can tell you that, Mr K.

17:11.239 --> 17:14.075
It won't look well at all. Gibberish.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.911
Babbling.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.457
I'm glad he's gone. I was worried
he might start in on Miss Burstner.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.253
- Oh, she's on her way up.
- Later than ever.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.216
Let's hope she was away
before those men came into her room.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.134
What time does she go?

17:31.259 --> 17:35.555
I believe she has to be dressed or
undressed for a performance at midnight.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.350
- The supper show.
- I don't know what they call it.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.894
- The supper show.
- I'm sure.

17:41.019 --> 17:45.941
- That's what they call it.
- I've never been in one of those places.

17:46.066 --> 17:50.904
Indeed, you may wonder why I rent my
second best room to a woman of that sort.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.573
- What do you mean?
- Theatricals, Mr K.

17:53.698 --> 17:58.578
This isn't really the place for them
as I'm sure you'll agree. I didn't know.

17:58.703 --> 18:03.542
She came with her mother. A perfectly
respectable woman, or so she seemed.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.878
And when she died, well, I...

18:07.003 --> 18:11.466
I'm always too soft-hearted
for my own good.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.301
- Mrs Grubach...
- Yes?

18:13.426 --> 18:15.095
What are you trying to say?

18:15.220 --> 18:18.807
You're hinting at something
concerning Miss Burstner.

18:18.932 --> 18:22.894
Well, since you ask, Mr K,
she not only performs in that place,

18:23.019 --> 18:25.438
but sits drinking afterwards with men.

18:25.564 --> 18:28.692
What I asked, Mrs Grubach, was
whether or not you were casting aspersions

18:28.817 --> 18:31.820
on the moral character of your own lodger.

18:31.945 --> 18:36.950
- Oh, Mr K, you shouldn't put it that way.
- Good night, Mrs Grubach.

18:37.075 --> 18:41.204
I wouldn't dream of giving her notice
without definite proof.

18:44.374 --> 18:47.919
You have to admit, Mr K,
it's in the interests of all my guests

18:48.044 --> 18:53.175
- to keep our house beyond reproach.
- Beyond reproach?!

18:54.134 --> 18:57.888
Mrs Grubach, if you're going to start
throwing people out of this house,

18:58.013 --> 19:02.267
you'd better begin with me!
Good night, Mrs Grubach.

19:02.934 --> 19:07.355
- You didn't understand.
- Good night, Mrs Grubach.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.985
- Good night, Mr K.
- Good night.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.281
Miss Burstner?

19:21.161 --> 19:22.537
Yes?

19:27.751 --> 19:29.753
- Mm?
- Good evening.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.048
Or good morning, rather.

19:33.173 --> 19:37.052
If you're stuck for something to say,
try, "Happy birthday".

19:37.177 --> 19:40.931
Oh, is it your birthday? Is that why
you're coming home so much later?

19:41.056 --> 19:44.810
I didn't know you kept track
of my hours, Mr...

19:45.727 --> 19:47.771
Well, I didn't mean that.

19:47.896 --> 19:51.399
Of course, it's none of my business.
It's nobody's business.

19:51.525 --> 19:54.486
That's right. Good night.

19:55.654 --> 19:57.489
Happy birthday.

20:14.589 --> 20:18.885
Oh! Oh, excuse me. Excuse me, no.
No, no...

20:24.641 --> 20:26.810
(Knock on door)

20:28.186 --> 20:29.563
Yes?

20:31.189 --> 20:33.984
Well, that's what I
ought to have done, naturally.

20:34.109 --> 20:38.530
- What ought you to have done?
- After I knocked, I should have waited.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.532
Come in.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.660
- You're not getting any funny ideas?
- Of course not.

20:43.785 --> 20:48.832
- Just because I knocked on your door.
- Well, that's what I mean.

20:48.957 --> 20:52.002
You did, didn't you? So why don't you?

20:54.504 --> 20:58.467
You're a nice boy,
but I'm not in the mood for it.

21:00.177 --> 21:03.180
It's been a long, hard night.

21:03.305 --> 21:06.057
- Yes, I know.
- What do you know about it?

21:07.225 --> 21:10.228
- I was talking about myself.
- That's what they all do.

21:10.353 --> 21:14.483
What else do they ever talk about?
So give me a rest.

21:14.608 --> 21:18.028
- All right.
- All right what?!

21:18.153 --> 21:23.575
Well, I'll do whatever you say, but
if you don't talk and you won't come in...

21:23.700 --> 21:28.788
How can I come in? That old bag's
just dying for a chance to throw me out.

21:28.914 --> 21:33.293
- Throw you out? Mrs Grubach?
- She's always got one ear open.

21:36.630 --> 21:38.673
- (She sighs)
- What's wrong?

21:38.799 --> 21:40.926
I told you, I'm tired.

21:41.051 --> 21:42.928
I'm sorry.

21:46.515 --> 21:49.643
- I forgot what I wanted to ask you.
- Maybe it'll come back to you.

21:49.768 --> 21:55.023
Nothing ever comes back to me.
Big statement. Shut up, everybody.

21:55.148 --> 21:59.194
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry. You keep saying that.

21:59.319 --> 22:02.781
- Who gives a damn?
- I know. I'm s...

22:02.906 --> 22:07.327
- What's the big joke?
- I almost said it again. You're right.

22:07.452 --> 22:10.413
Nobody gives a damn. I know you don't.

22:10.539 --> 22:15.168
- I don't what? Hey, keep the door open!
- I was agreeing with you.

22:15.293 --> 22:17.838
- What you just said.
- I don't know what I just said.

22:17.963 --> 22:22.634
Oh, Jesus,
all that lousy national champagne.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.470
- You know what they make it of?
- No.

22:25.595 --> 22:30.016
Neither does anybody else.
No switching with the cold tea either.

22:30.142 --> 22:33.436
Not tonight.
The customer knew all about that one.

22:33.562 --> 22:36.690
He kept taking cute little sips
out of my glass

22:36.815 --> 22:41.444
just to make sure
I was getting myself putrefied.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.156
I'm sorry.

22:44.281 --> 22:46.658
Damn! There I go again.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.994
It's never any use, is it, apologising?

22:49.119 --> 22:52.831
It's even worse when you haven't done
anything wrong and still feel guilty.

22:52.956 --> 22:57.335
I can remember my father looking at me
straight in the eye. "Come on, boy.

22:57.461 --> 22:59.838
"Exactly what have you been up to?"

22:59.963 --> 23:04.468
Even when I hadn't been up to
anything at all, I'd still feel guilty.

23:04.593 --> 23:09.681
The teacher, when something was missing
from her desk. "Who's the guilty one?"

23:09.806 --> 23:13.727
It was me, of course.
I'd feel just sick with guilt.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.855
And I didn't even know what was missing.

23:18.106 --> 23:20.609
Maybe... yeah, that must be it.

23:20.734 --> 23:24.488
Unless your thoughts are innocent, 100%.

23:27.949 --> 23:30.160
Can that be said of anybody?

23:31.369 --> 23:33.997
Even the saints have temptations.

23:42.422 --> 23:46.051
- What do you think?
- I think you're crazy.

23:46.176 --> 23:49.930
Maybe you're right. That would certainly
explain... No, I must reject that.

23:50.055 --> 23:53.433
I must reject everything but facts.

23:53.558 --> 23:56.645
I am sane. I am innocent.
I have committed no crime.

23:56.770 --> 24:00.482
- Three cheers for you!
- You don't believe me.

24:00.607 --> 24:05.195
- Sure I believe you.
- Be honest. What do you really think?

24:05.320 --> 24:09.157
- You've been out some place.
- Drinking, you mean?

24:09.282 --> 24:11.701
Is that what you think? I'm drunk?!

24:11.827 --> 24:16.581
Next time, come to my place.
I get a percentage on every bottle.

24:16.706 --> 24:21.628
I have not left this apartment since
I got back from the office last night.

24:21.753 --> 24:25.549
- And I am not a solitary drinker.
- Then what's your problem?

24:26.383 --> 24:28.093
I'm under arrest.

24:28.218 --> 24:30.887
- Yeah?
- Unbelievable, isn't it?

24:31.012 --> 24:34.850
- Well, it happens.
- I don't know how it happens!

24:34.975 --> 24:39.104
How do you know you're arrested? It isn't
something you notice, like bleeding gums.

24:39.229 --> 24:43.483
- They woke me up and told me.
- Are you sure you were awake?

24:43.608 --> 24:46.027
Yeah, just look at those photographs.

24:47.028 --> 24:52.409
It's my mother in different poses.
Burstner's Birds. A real good act.

24:52.534 --> 24:56.079
Let's leave my mother out of it.
Do you mind? No offence.

24:56.204 --> 24:58.790
- What did they get you for?
- I wouldn't say they got me.

24:58.915 --> 25:01.626
- They arrested you.
- That's what they told me.

25:01.751 --> 25:04.171
- What's the charge?
- That's what they didn't tell me.

25:04.296 --> 25:08.175
All I know is I'm supposed to appear
before some interrogation commission.

25:08.300 --> 25:11.011
- That's only for serious crimes.
- That's what I thought!

25:11.136 --> 25:14.890
- Did they tell you it wasn't serious?
- No, they didn't say that.

25:15.015 --> 25:19.019
- Maybe it's a gag or something.
- That thought occurred to me at first.

25:19.144 --> 25:23.398
Some of the fellas at the office.
Some sort of elaborate practical joke.

25:23.523 --> 25:26.902
But I didn't really believe that.
I just wanted to.

25:27.027 --> 25:30.822
It's awful
how easy it is to get demoralised.

25:32.115 --> 25:34.242
Well, of course, that's what they want.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.788
That's what they're counting on.
I'm not such a fool that I...

25:38.914 --> 25:42.876
- You must have done something.
- Oh, don't you say that!

25:43.001 --> 25:45.212
Or somebody's been telling lies about you.

25:45.337 --> 25:49.007
Rumours always fly around for no reason.
At the office.

25:49.132 --> 25:53.136
- What kind of rumours?
- You mean in my case?

25:53.261 --> 25:58.475
- That's it. I haven't the faintest idea!
- Jesus! I hope it isn't political!

25:58.600 --> 26:02.062
- Oh, no, nothing like that.
- Politics! Don't drag me into it!

26:02.187 --> 26:06.942
- They were just talking in circles.
- It's not my fault! I don't want to talk.

26:07.067 --> 26:09.778
- What are you doing in here?
- You invited me.

26:09.903 --> 26:12.239
- That's what you say!
- Please...

26:12.364 --> 26:16.993
Please what? Listen, if you're in trouble
I'm sorry, real sorry.

26:17.118 --> 26:20.956
- But keep me out of it.
- I did! I am. I told them,

26:21.081 --> 26:25.919
but they wouldn't listen. Then when they
messed with your mother's photographs...!

26:26.044 --> 26:30.465
What?! Who's been messing around
with my mother's photographs?

26:30.590 --> 26:32.801
Rabensteiner, I think it was.

26:35.554 --> 26:37.305
But also the police.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.726
- The police?
- That's what I've been telling you.

26:41.852 --> 26:43.228
- Miss...
- Get out!

26:43.353 --> 26:45.021
- Get out of here!
- Please!

26:45.147 --> 26:50.068
- Get out and leave me alone!
- What will the other lodgers think?

26:50.193 --> 26:53.280
- Get the hell out of my room!
- I'm out!

27:02.497 --> 27:04.708
(Typewriters clack)

27:22.100 --> 27:24.478
- Mr K...
- I'll see people in a minute.

27:24.603 --> 27:28.815
The Deputy Manager was looking for you.
And your cousin's here.

27:29.566 --> 27:32.777
My cousin?
She's not supposed to come to the office.

27:32.903 --> 27:35.655
She said it was serious.

27:39.576 --> 27:42.579
- K.
- Oh, good morning, sir.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.540
I was just arranging a birthday surprise.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.501
In here? In this broom closet?

27:47.626 --> 27:51.671
Well, I have this, this birthday cake
for one of my fellow lodgers.

27:51.797 --> 27:56.635
- I didn't think I should carry it.
- Who is she?

27:56.760 --> 28:01.515
If I'd only known about this lady before,
she'd have been included for tonight.

28:01.640 --> 28:04.768
- The theatre tickets are all booked.
- Oh, I know, I know.

28:04.893 --> 28:07.813
She'll understand I hope, the girl.

28:07.938 --> 28:12.442
The cake is actually
by way of being a peace offering.

28:12.567 --> 28:16.905
If she doesn't take it in the right
spirit, K, she's not the girl for you.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.532
Who's that?

28:20.200 --> 28:23.829
That... That's my cousin Irmie.
What's she doing here?

28:23.954 --> 28:27.582
- Your cousin?
- Yes, from the city. Going to school...

28:27.707 --> 28:31.545
From the country,
going to school in the city.

28:31.670 --> 28:34.297
We'll have to keep an eye on you, old man.

28:35.257 --> 28:38.009
- She looks pretty young.
- Yes, sir.

28:38.135 --> 28:40.804
There's a place for everything, right, K?

28:40.929 --> 28:44.933
Oh, she's never dared to come into the
office before. I can assure you of that.

28:45.058 --> 28:50.147
You're a bright young man. On the way up.
Don't spoil things for yourself.

28:50.272 --> 28:53.024
- No.
- How old is she?

28:53.150 --> 28:58.405
- What? Irmie? She...
- She can't be more than 16. If that.

28:58.530 --> 29:02.200
- Yeah.
- My God.

29:02.325 --> 29:06.329
- Mr K, the young lady...
- Get her out of here!

29:06.454 --> 29:11.668
- But she said that it's urgent.
- I don't care. Just get her out of here.

29:17.424 --> 29:19.634
(Typewriters clack)

29:23.930 --> 29:25.849
(Dog howls)

29:31.146 --> 29:33.940
- Isn't that Miss Burstner's trunk?
- And what if it is?

29:34.065 --> 29:38.153
I thought I recognised it.
You take the birthday cake.

29:38.278 --> 29:43.116
- I have quite enough on my hands.
- That's what I mean. Let me help you.

29:43.241 --> 29:44.910
- No, thank you.
- Please...

29:45.035 --> 29:48.205
- No, thank you.
- Let me call you a cab.

29:48.330 --> 29:50.832
Not everyone can afford taxi cabs, Mr K.

29:50.957 --> 29:53.543
Oh, you know my name?

29:53.668 --> 29:57.881
Excuse me, you are a friend of hers?
Could you tell me if she's home?

29:58.006 --> 30:01.676
If by "home" you refer
to Mrs Grubach's establishment,

30:01.802 --> 30:04.012
the answer to your question is no.

30:04.137 --> 30:07.390
Marika has a home,
but not at Mrs Grubach's.

30:07.516 --> 30:09.768
- Marika?
- Pardon?

30:10.602 --> 30:12.270
I never knew her first name.

30:12.395 --> 30:16.483
- How ironic.
- She has a home? Another home?

30:16.608 --> 30:18.819
She has one now, luckily.

30:19.986 --> 30:24.199
- I wish you'd let me help you with that.
- It's extremely heavy!

30:24.324 --> 30:27.077
I'll take it to her myself, thank you.

30:27.202 --> 30:31.623
- Take it to her? To where?
- I hope you don't intend to follow me.

30:31.748 --> 30:35.585
- No, not at all.
- You've been dogging my footsteps.

30:35.710 --> 30:38.880
Well, I hate to see a woman dragging
a great heavy trunk.

30:39.005 --> 30:43.343
- Especially with a physical disability?
- No, not at all.

30:43.468 --> 30:46.012
Since you find the spectacle
so unpleasant,

30:46.138 --> 30:48.306
why not spare your feelings

30:48.431 --> 30:52.185
and remove yourself
from the cause of your distress?

30:52.310 --> 30:54.229
I'm sorry.

30:55.522 --> 30:58.150
Listen, the last thing I want
is to annoy you, but...

30:58.275 --> 31:02.320
I would like very much to know
if Miss Burstner is moving

31:02.445 --> 31:05.365
or planning to move
and, if so, where to?

31:05.490 --> 31:10.078
- Anything else?
- Yes, well, I'd like to know why.

31:10.203 --> 31:14.624
And you have the unmitigated gall
to pretend you don't know.

31:14.749 --> 31:17.878
Well, no, how could I?
I-I've just got home.

31:18.003 --> 31:20.213
She didn't seem to be planning to move.

31:20.338 --> 31:24.801
She wasn't, Mr K.
It came as a very nasty surprise.

31:24.926 --> 31:28.555
You make it sound
as if I were responsible.

31:28.680 --> 31:32.767
- You pretend it's nothing to do with you?
- I don't pretend anything!

31:32.893 --> 31:35.604
All we did was talk. I did kiss her.

31:35.729 --> 31:40.150
I hope you're not trying to tell me
that because I kissed her

31:40.275 --> 31:42.777
she's changing her address?!

31:42.903 --> 31:47.866
I mean, after all, she's a woman
of the world. She works in a nightclub.

31:47.991 --> 31:50.410
What are you insinuating?

31:50.535 --> 31:55.248
Well, nothing, but you have to admit
she's a grown woman, not a minor.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.585
Somebody must have kissed her before.

31:58.710 --> 32:02.839
Do you think this is a topic
to be shouted through the public streets?

32:02.964 --> 32:05.967
- Hell! HELL!
- There is no need to curse.

32:06.092 --> 32:10.472
Why am I always in the wrong without even
knowing what for or what it's all about?

32:10.597 --> 32:13.558
That's not something
I'm prepared to discuss, Mr K.

32:13.683 --> 32:15.519
Examine your conscience.

32:15.644 --> 32:18.855
There's nothing wrong
with my conscience, thank you.

32:18.980 --> 32:23.944
Marika has stayed with Mrs Grubach
longer than you have. Don't forget that.

32:24.069 --> 32:26.029
She was very fond of that room.

32:26.154 --> 32:29.699
My poor little room is dark and damp
and poorly heated.

32:29.825 --> 32:34.412
- She won't be nearly as comfortable!
- Then why move, for God's sake?!

32:34.538 --> 32:38.542
I'm a woman and a cripple,
but I don't need to stand for your abuse.

32:40.127 --> 32:43.130
Go scream at that Grubach woman!

32:43.255 --> 32:45.632
Wait a minute. You don't mean...?

32:46.967 --> 32:48.885
Oh, hell, it's late.

32:49.970 --> 32:53.014
I'll never get dressed for the theatre.
First, you've got to tell me the truth.

32:53.140 --> 32:56.309
Did Mrs Grubach ask her to leave?

32:56.434 --> 32:59.187
She did make a few uncalled-for remarks
about Miss Burstner.

32:59.312 --> 33:04.067
I took exception to them.
I told Mrs Grubach she was out of line.

33:04.192 --> 33:08.613
- Out of line, indeed!
- You mean she just threw her out?

33:11.908 --> 33:14.244
Then I guess I am responsible.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.413
Listen, Miss...

33:16.538 --> 33:18.665
Er, Mrs...

33:23.003 --> 33:25.005
(Dramatic overture)

33:35.599 --> 33:40.020
(Whispers) Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me. I have a note here for you.

33:40.145 --> 33:44.357
Yes, it's for you.
They passed it down.

34:11.551 --> 34:12.928
Mr K.

34:18.683 --> 34:20.435
Come with me, Mr K.

34:37.619 --> 34:41.164
We're making every reasonable effort
to keep from interfering unnecessarily

34:41.289 --> 34:44.543
with the normal pattern of your life.

34:46.128 --> 34:47.629
For instance,

34:47.754 --> 34:51.925
so you wouldn't have to request
special leave of absence from your office,

34:52.050 --> 34:55.428
we've arranged
to fit in these interrogations

34:55.554 --> 34:58.223
outside your normal working hours.

35:02.686 --> 35:04.688
Step into the light, Mr K.

35:06.022 --> 35:07.732
Who are they?

35:07.858 --> 35:11.278
I can't expect you to know where
the Interrogation Commission is sitting.

35:11.403 --> 35:13.780
That's right. I don't.

35:15.240 --> 35:19.870
I filled this out in your name and
so you won't get lost I've drawn a map.

35:19.995 --> 35:21.079
Thanks.

35:21.204 --> 35:25.292
- Present that immediately on arrival.
- And when is that?

35:25.417 --> 35:27.127
- Immediately.
- Tonight?

35:27.252 --> 35:30.547
I hope you won't have
too much trouble locating it.

35:30.672 --> 35:34.676
- If I do, these two can set me straight.
- What exactly do you mean?

35:34.801 --> 35:39.389
Aren't they supposed to trail around
after me, observing my movements?

35:40.599 --> 35:43.143
No, they aren't going to follow you.

35:43.268 --> 35:45.562
That isn't their job.

37:01.763 --> 37:03.598
Go right in there.

37:08.436 --> 37:11.356
(Loud murmurings)

37:12.190 --> 37:16.111
I'd better close the doors after you.
Nobody else must come in.

37:27.664 --> 37:32.836
(Judge) You should have been here
one hour and five minutes ago!

37:33.837 --> 37:36.882
These delays must not occur again.

37:37.007 --> 37:38.675
Please step up.

37:52.022 --> 37:55.567
- You are a housepainter?
- No.

37:59.446 --> 38:03.492
The question from the Examining Magistrate
about my being a housepainter is typical

38:03.617 --> 38:07.204
of this so-called trial
that's being foisted upon me.

38:08.413 --> 38:12.751
Why, the very notebook of the Examining
Magistrate confirms what I say!

38:12.876 --> 38:17.547
These are
the Examining Magistrate's records!

38:17.672 --> 38:20.842
What's happening to me
is of no great importance,

38:20.967 --> 38:26.139
but it is representative of what is
happening to a great many other people.

38:27.974 --> 38:31.853
And it is for these others that I take
my stand here, not for myself alone.

38:31.978 --> 38:34.439
(Man) That's it, boy! Give them hell!

38:34.564 --> 38:37.734
I have been arrested and perhaps,
considering the opening statement,

38:37.859 --> 38:43.114
perhaps they had orders to arrest
some housepainter as innocent as I am!

38:43.240 --> 38:45.992
They tried to get me to bribe them,

38:46.117 --> 38:50.121
to steal my clothes and shirts from me!
I managed to keep calm.

38:50.247 --> 38:52.874
I asked them very simply
why I was arrested.

38:52.999 --> 38:55.961
And what was the answer
of your self-styled Inspector?

38:56.086 --> 38:58.505
If he were here,
he would have to back me up in this.

38:58.630 --> 39:03.385
He answered, in effect, nothing at all.
He'd arrested me. That was enough.

39:04.136 --> 39:07.597
I notice your Examining Magistrate
has just given some of you a secret sign.

39:07.722 --> 39:11.935
I don't know if it was meant to be
a signal for applause or hissing,

39:12.060 --> 39:17.190
but I hereby publicly empower him
to address his hired agents out loud!

39:17.315 --> 39:19.651
Let him say hiss now or clap now!

39:20.569 --> 39:23.989
Can there be any doubt
that behind my arrest

39:24.114 --> 39:27.534
a vast organisation is at work,

39:27.659 --> 39:32.205
an establishment which contains a retinue
of civil servants, officers, police,

39:32.330 --> 39:34.541
perhaps even hangmen!

39:49.222 --> 39:54.436
I notice you all have the same badge, so
every damn one's an official of some kind.

39:54.561 --> 39:58.356
That means you've all come rushing here
to nose out what you can about me.

39:58.482 --> 40:02.694
Half of you clapped just to lead me on!
Get out of my way!

40:02.819 --> 40:06.198
Maybe you wanted some practice
in fooling an innocent man.

40:06.323 --> 40:10.744
Perhaps you found some amusement
in my expecting an interest in justice!

40:12.078 --> 40:15.582
One moment!
I merely wish to point out that tonight

40:15.707 --> 40:19.002
you have thrown away with your own hand
all the advantages

40:19.127 --> 40:23.006
which an interrogation confers
on an accused man.

40:23.131 --> 40:25.133
Just you wait.

40:26.718 --> 40:28.720
(Doors clang)

40:43.443 --> 40:45.821
(A man groans)

40:45.946 --> 40:49.157
'Oh... Oh, no...

40:49.282 --> 40:50.826
'No... '

41:08.301 --> 41:10.303
(Man groans)

41:23.358 --> 41:25.986
- Sir!
- What are you doing here?

41:26.111 --> 41:29.990
- We're going to be flogged.
- You what?!

41:30.115 --> 41:35.120
- It's all because of you, mister.
- Your fault. You told the authorities.

41:35.245 --> 41:39.249
- You accused us of corruption.
- You lodged a complaint.

41:39.374 --> 41:43.879
- I only mentioned to the Inspector...
- And to the Examining Magistrate.

41:44.004 --> 41:46.381
- Accused us of soliciting for bribes.
- Well...

41:46.506 --> 41:49.426
If you knew what we have to live on!

41:49.551 --> 41:55.348
- I've got a family to feed.
- It's custom to get the prisoner's linen.

41:55.474 --> 41:59.186
- What difference can a few shirts make?
- Nothing!

41:59.311 --> 42:02.522
Nothing at all!
But still you had to denounce us.

42:02.647 --> 42:06.651
It wasn't anything personal.
I was defending a principle.

42:06.776 --> 42:09.613
- I told you...
- Shut up!

42:13.325 --> 42:14.826
No!

42:14.951 --> 42:18.622
Even with a few shirts
if the authorities had found out

42:18.747 --> 42:22.709
nothing would have happened
if you hadn't denounced!

42:22.834 --> 42:26.838
- It's because of YOU!
- What kind of justice do you call that?

42:26.963 --> 42:30.175
We've all got clean records.
Me, especially.

42:30.300 --> 42:35.347
Take him. If anyone complained about him,
would he be where he is now?

42:35.472 --> 42:38.183
- Imagine how painful it is...
- You two, strip.

42:38.308 --> 42:40.727
I have to take off my clothes!

42:40.852 --> 42:43.480
- Look...
- What do you want?

42:43.605 --> 42:47.859
If... if you could see your way through
to letting them off, I'd appreciate it.

42:47.984 --> 42:51.196
What are you trying to do?
You'll complain against me?

42:51.321 --> 42:53.782
No, I haven't lodged any complaint.

42:53.907 --> 42:59.412
If I wanted those men to be punished,
I could leave right now, close the door

42:59.538 --> 43:03.917
and forget about the whole thing,
but they're not to blame.

43:04.042 --> 43:08.839
It's the people above them,
the authorities, the whole organisation.

43:08.964 --> 43:13.260
If it were one of the high judges,
I'd even pay extra to encourage it.

43:13.385 --> 43:15.720
I don't take bribes in any circumstances.

43:15.846 --> 43:19.683
Please, please.
Please, please, try to get me off.

43:19.808 --> 43:22.310
Frank's older than I am.
His nerves are better.

43:22.435 --> 43:24.229
He's been punished before.

43:24.354 --> 43:26.398
I won't wait any longer!

43:28.233 --> 43:32.487
He won't give you any trouble.
He knows better.

43:40.120 --> 43:41.496
Aah!

43:42.497 --> 43:45.459
Don't leave me! Don't...!

43:47.586 --> 43:50.964
Please... Don't go! Don't go!

44:12.027 --> 44:14.571
- Mr K!
- What...?

44:14.696 --> 44:18.200
There's a man in your office.
He says he's your uncle Max.

44:18.325 --> 44:20.744
(Typewriters clack)

44:44.017 --> 44:45.852
Uncle Max?

44:49.523 --> 44:53.318
- Well, my boy.
- What brings you into town?

44:53.443 --> 44:55.111
Josef...

44:56.655 --> 44:58.657
...is it true?

45:00.867 --> 45:04.496
Yes, it's...
Yes, it's true enough, I'm afraid.

45:04.621 --> 45:06.832
And you're under arrest?

45:07.958 --> 45:10.293
Please, Uncle Max.
We'll talk about it later.

45:10.418 --> 45:14.714
Very well, then.
Just go ahead with your work, my boy.

45:24.391 --> 45:26.143
Don't mind me.

45:39.698 --> 45:43.118
- It's not a criminal case, is it?
- It is.

45:44.244 --> 45:46.204
Well?

45:46.329 --> 45:47.914
That's...

45:48.874 --> 45:50.500
That's what they tell me.

45:50.625 --> 45:52.794
And you just coolly sit here?!

46:00.552 --> 46:03.138
- If you won't think of yourself...
- What?

46:03.263 --> 46:07.684
If you won't think of yourself,
think of the family, our good name.

46:11.605 --> 46:14.566
How did you... find out about it?

46:15.650 --> 46:18.153
Irmie called me
on the long-distance telephone.

46:18.278 --> 46:20.238
- Irmie.
- Yes! Poor little Irmie,

46:20.363 --> 46:23.074
who you wouldn't so much as receive here!

46:24.409 --> 46:29.414
I can't hold lengthy conversations
with family relatives

46:30.207 --> 46:31.958
during working hours.

46:33.502 --> 46:37.339
- I suppose that applies to me, too.
- Oh, Uncle Max...

46:37.464 --> 46:42.844
My only thought when I made this long,
exhausting trip was to help you, but no...

46:46.306 --> 46:48.099
You don't even want to see me.

46:48.225 --> 46:51.394
Yes, of course I do, but...

46:51.520 --> 46:54.898
you must realise how difficult it is...

46:57.192 --> 46:59.069
during working hours.

47:04.783 --> 47:09.079
Well, it looks to me as though
your working hours are over, Josef.

47:10.163 --> 47:12.165
Come on.

47:12.290 --> 47:13.708
After all, Josef,

47:13.834 --> 47:18.713
I'm the nearest thing to a parent
and a father that you can lay claim to.

47:18.839 --> 47:22.134
Oh, I don't forget it, Uncle Max,
believe me.

47:34.104 --> 47:36.648
We've got to get
some competent legal advice, Josef.

47:36.773 --> 47:39.359
Things like this don't happen
right out of the blue.

47:39.484 --> 47:42.112
- In a criminal case...
- Please, Uncle Max. People are listening.

47:42.237 --> 47:46.241
- What's that up there?
- The computer.

47:50.745 --> 47:54.291
One of those electronic gimmicks?
That can give you the answer to anything?

47:54.416 --> 47:55.792
Yes.

47:57.794 --> 47:59.754
- Well...
- Well what?

47:59.880 --> 48:04.009
You want to know about your case,
don't you? Ask the machine!

48:04.134 --> 48:08.847
- It wouldn't be allowed.
- These things can always be arranged.

48:08.972 --> 48:10.682
What would I ask?

48:12.058 --> 48:15.353
Uncle Max, I... I don't even know
what I'm charged with.

48:15.479 --> 48:20.484
Well, that's one question. The brain thing
ought to be able to figure it out.

48:20.609 --> 48:24.905
Well, she'd need the data -
economic, sociological, psychological.

48:25.030 --> 48:29.367
Still, she might be able to handle it.
She processes personality tests.

48:29.493 --> 48:33.205
An awful lot of material
would have to be fed to her.

48:33.330 --> 48:36.458
- It's a she?
- That's the way the experts talk.

48:36.583 --> 48:40.545
I see. Like for a car or a boat.
Kind of affectionate.

48:40.670 --> 48:45.175
- Respect, really. More than that.
- Love? Terror?

48:45.926 --> 48:49.012
- I don't know.
- If she's a woman, I'd be careful.

48:50.222 --> 48:52.390
(Man cries out)

48:53.183 --> 48:54.935
W-Wait, wait a minute.

48:58.647 --> 49:02.984
It's a... It must be a dog somewhere.
It's the little dog in the courtyard.

49:08.156 --> 49:11.493
He's putting adhesive tape over our
mouths. You won't hear any screaming.

49:15.580 --> 49:17.499
(Muffled speech)

49:31.805 --> 49:34.975
This gentleman says he's in charge
of the electronic brain.

49:35.100 --> 49:38.395
- Not in charge...
- One of the technical experts, anyway.

49:38.520 --> 49:42.482
You talk about data and facts.
Crime is a fact.

49:42.607 --> 49:46.862
- Suppose I committed a crime...
- Uncle Max, these men are extremely busy.

49:46.987 --> 49:48.780
It seems they work in shifts.

49:48.905 --> 49:53.660
- After 11, they could show you around.
- That's all right. Thank you. Come on.

49:53.785 --> 49:55.370
I agree with you, Josef.

49:55.495 --> 50:00.083
All these fancy electronics, they're all right,
but not for anything practical.

50:00.208 --> 50:01.960
Please!

50:02.085 --> 50:05.922
You can't diddle your way out of
a criminal charge with an adding machine.

50:06.590 --> 50:08.925
(Impatient knocking)

50:11.303 --> 50:14.347
Open up! We're friends of the Advocate.

50:14.473 --> 50:16.683
We've got to see him
on very important business.

50:16.808 --> 50:19.436
I don't care how busy he is.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.277
K is the name. Announce us, will you?

50:27.402 --> 50:31.072
She doesn't look like a maid to me.
More like a nurse.

50:31.198 --> 50:35.827
- The Advocate is ill.
- III? You say he's ill? His heart again?

50:35.952 --> 50:37.496
He never was too healthy.

50:38.246 --> 50:41.208
This may be a strange hour
to pay a professional call,

50:41.333 --> 50:43.835
but old Hastler isn't going to
hold that against me.

50:43.960 --> 50:46.171
We were at school together.

50:46.296 --> 50:49.007
He's had quite a reputation in his time.

50:51.134 --> 50:53.804
- (Advocate) Leni?
- No, it's Max.

50:53.929 --> 50:59.017
I told you, I'm too ill for visitors!
Don't let these people in.

50:59.142 --> 51:03.146
- Go away!
- Albert, don't you remember me?

51:03.271 --> 51:05.398
It's your old friend, Max.

51:05.524 --> 51:09.903
- Who's that with you?
- Albert, what's wrong? Had...?

51:12.489 --> 51:16.034
Had another of your attacks?
Don't worry. You always get over them.

51:16.159 --> 51:21.164
Are they looking after you properly?
It's terribly gloomy. No lights.

51:21.289 --> 51:25.460
Power failure, of course.
And what about this nurse of yours, eh?

51:25.585 --> 51:28.255
Mm, Leni?

51:28.380 --> 51:32.509
Leni's a good girl.
A very good girl indeed.

51:33.552 --> 51:37.305
Leni takes excellent care of me.
Don't you, darling?

51:37.430 --> 51:42.310
Miss, be kind enough to leave us alone.
I must speak to the Advocate.

51:42.435 --> 51:46.898
- He's ill. You can't talk business now.
- (Max) You damn little... Miss!

51:50.068 --> 51:54.114
We could discuss anything
in front of Leni.

51:54.239 --> 51:56.283
- Ssh!
- Leni, Leni...

51:56.408 --> 52:00.912
- This doesn't concern myself.
- Whom does it concern?

52:01.037 --> 52:03.665
My nephew. I've brought him here with me.

52:03.790 --> 52:05.917
Josef K.

52:06.042 --> 52:07.419
Who?

52:11.548 --> 52:13.383
Josef K?

52:14.384 --> 52:16.720
I didn't notice you. So...

52:16.845 --> 52:20.599
So you came to see me about this case?
That's good.

52:20.724 --> 52:25.145
- It's a most interesting affair.
- Careful now, Josef.

52:25.270 --> 52:27.898
- You know about my case already?
- How's that?

52:29.024 --> 52:30.484
I...

52:31.193 --> 52:32.986
I don't understand.

52:34.571 --> 52:36.698
I'm the one that doesn't understand.

52:36.823 --> 52:39.993
It is your case, isn't it,
that you want to consult me about?

52:40.118 --> 52:45.415
- Of course it is!
- Advocate Hastler has heard of my case.

52:45.540 --> 52:50.378
Oh, in the circles I move in, all sorts
of different cases come up for discussion.

52:50.504 --> 52:55.717
The interesting ones stick in my mind.
Particularly the nephew of an old friend.

52:55.842 --> 52:58.261
Of course, that's logical, Josef.

52:58.970 --> 53:01.139
You say you move in these circles.

53:02.224 --> 53:04.851
Does that mean you are
actually connected with the courts?

53:04.976 --> 53:08.688
With whom else should I associate
if not men of my own profession?

53:08.814 --> 53:11.024
That's certainly incontrovertible.

53:11.149 --> 53:14.319
I'm handicapped these days by illness,

53:14.444 --> 53:18.114
but good friends from the law courts
still visit me from time to time.

53:18.240 --> 53:20.575
I learn many interesting things from them.

53:20.700 --> 53:25.914
For instance, there's a dear friend
of mine visiting me at this very moment.

53:26.748 --> 53:30.877
We were chatting here together when
you two burst in and took us by surprise.

53:31.002 --> 53:35.465
He preferred to withdraw with his chair
and his table into the corner.

53:36.925 --> 53:39.719
The Chief Clerk of the Law Court.

53:41.012 --> 53:43.515
- Where?
- There he is.

53:48.395 --> 53:50.230
There.

53:51.356 --> 53:53.441
I beg your pardon, sir.

53:53.567 --> 53:55.902
I forgot to introduce you.

53:56.027 --> 53:59.197
This is my old friend K
and his nephew.

53:59.322 --> 54:05.036
I know, sir, that you are interested
in this case. Josef K. Leave us, Leni.

54:05.162 --> 54:07.581
The Chief Clerk is a very busy man,

54:07.706 --> 54:11.251
but perhaps he'll stay for a moment
and advise us?

54:11.376 --> 54:16.798
- Yes, we'd certainly be honoured.
- I can stay for only a few minutes.

54:16.923 --> 54:19.342
I know how pressed you are for time,

54:19.468 --> 54:23.054
but the Chief Clerk will tell you,
my dear old friend,

54:23.180 --> 54:27.767
I've defended a great number of
these cases, Max, and won a few of them.

54:27.893 --> 54:30.520
- At least partially.
- Partially.

54:30.645 --> 54:35.358
It's important to get our first plea ready.
That often determines proceedings.

54:35.484 --> 54:40.197
However, in actual practice, the first
plea is not usually read by the court.

54:40.322 --> 54:44.993
- Oh? And why is that?
- Very often they simply file it away.

54:45.118 --> 54:47.245
(Glass breaks)

54:50.749 --> 54:55.587
Your friend should be warned that the case
of Josef K is likely to be followed

54:55.712 --> 54:57.714
through any number of courts.

54:57.839 --> 55:00.258
(Advocate) And sometimes the case...

55:13.063 --> 55:14.898
I broke the glass.

55:15.565 --> 55:18.944
- Why did you do that?
- To attract your attention.

55:19.820 --> 55:22.072
I wanted you to come here to me.

55:29.329 --> 55:31.540
I was thinking of you, too.

55:31.665 --> 55:35.335
In there,
you couldn't keep your eyes off me.

55:35.460 --> 55:37.671
And yet you left me to wait.

55:38.588 --> 55:41.508
I couldn't just get up and
walk out of the room without any excuse.

55:41.633 --> 55:44.302
- That's not mine...
- You did it, though.

55:45.679 --> 55:48.932
Yes, I did. That's not my coat.

55:49.057 --> 55:52.936
If you're going out, you'd better take it.
You weren't wearing a coat.

55:53.061 --> 55:57.482
I'm not going out. I can't even stay here.
I've got to get... back to them.

56:00.610 --> 56:03.405
I know you don't really like me,

56:03.530 --> 56:07.576
but I'm going to make love to you
and then you won't be able to go.

56:08.869 --> 56:11.371
Yeah, but what will they say back there?

56:13.957 --> 56:16.168
You don't like me at all.

56:17.544 --> 56:20.172
Well, "like" is a very feeble word.

56:22.757 --> 56:25.385
- You've got a sweetheart?
- No.

56:25.510 --> 56:29.514
I'll bet you do have one.
A boy like you is bound to have somebody.

56:31.349 --> 56:34.519
- Well, as a matter of fact...
- Tell me about her.

56:34.644 --> 56:38.273
There isn't much to tell.
I don't know where she lives.

56:38.398 --> 56:41.443
- I've got her photograph.
- Ah, you've got her photograph.

56:44.112 --> 56:46.573
What is she? Some kind of an actress?

56:46.698 --> 56:48.742
No, a dancer.

56:50.619 --> 56:52.787
She's not so young, is she?

56:52.913 --> 56:55.832
I don't think I like her.
She looks hard and selfish.

56:55.957 --> 57:00.670
A girl like that wouldn't be able
to sacrifice herself for a man.

57:00.796 --> 57:02.798
Certainly not for me.

57:04.800 --> 57:07.469
(Whispers)
Has she got any physical defect?

57:07.594 --> 57:11.598
- What?
- Has she got any physical defect?

57:12.891 --> 57:14.643
Why, no, of course not.

57:15.977 --> 57:19.689
If you don't know where she's gone,
I guess she doesn't mean much to you

57:19.815 --> 57:22.192
or you'd find out.

57:22.317 --> 57:24.319
I'll find out.

57:29.491 --> 57:31.701
I've got a physical defect.

57:33.662 --> 57:36.039
I'll show you. Come on.

57:57.310 --> 57:58.687
Look!

57:59.855 --> 58:02.482
The skin between my two middle fingers.

58:07.445 --> 58:09.447
It's like a web.

58:09.573 --> 58:13.034
A web.
What a pretty little paw.

58:30.093 --> 58:34.264
- You'd better go.
- Go?! Are you serious?

58:34.389 --> 58:37.767
I'll say you weren't feeling well
or something.

58:37.893 --> 58:40.228
That you needed some fresh air.

58:40.353 --> 58:43.982
I'll be back in a minute to let you out.
I've got to get the keys.

58:44.107 --> 58:48.570
- The keys? Are we locked in here?
- I don't want you locked out.

58:48.695 --> 58:52.574
The keys are to let you in yourself
during the nights.

58:52.699 --> 58:55.452
- Whenever you feel like it.
- Good.

58:59.080 --> 59:01.708
- (Crash of thunder)
- Who's that?

59:01.833 --> 59:04.044
- My big picture?
- Yes.

59:05.545 --> 59:08.298
- That could be my judge, I suppose.
- I know him.

59:08.924 --> 59:10.926
He's not a big man like that.

59:11.051 --> 59:13.553
He's little. Almost a dwarf.

59:16.139 --> 59:20.060
But look at the way
he had himself painted.

59:20.185 --> 59:24.022
He's vain.
Of course, like everybody else here.

59:24.898 --> 59:26.691
I'm vain myself.

59:26.817 --> 59:29.528
And it bothers me
that you don't like me more than you do.

59:29.653 --> 59:32.197
High Court judges come here to see you?

59:32.322 --> 59:37.619
- Oh, no. Just an Examining Magistrate.
- Only an Examining Magistrate?

59:37.744 --> 59:41.581
The higher officials
certainly keep themselves well hidden.

59:41.706 --> 59:45.544
His fancy robes and the throne
are just an invention.

59:45.669 --> 59:50.507
Actually, he sits on a kitchen chair
with an old horse rag doubled under him.

59:51.716 --> 59:54.052
(Crash of thunder)

01:00:00.976 --> 01:00:04.146
- Ow!
- Must you always brood over your case?

01:00:04.271 --> 01:00:10.193
- Probably I don't think enough about it.
- That's not the mistake you're making.

01:00:10.318 --> 01:00:14.072
You're too stubborn and too much
of a troublemaker. That's what I hear.

01:00:14.197 --> 01:00:16.408
Who told you that?

01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:19.077
You mustn't ask me for names.

01:00:19.202 --> 01:00:23.707
Just take my warning to heart
and try to be a little more co-operative.

01:00:23.832 --> 01:00:26.042
Co-operative? Brother!

01:00:44.978 --> 01:00:48.273
The first chance you get,
you ought to make your confession.

01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:53.403
Until you do that, there isn't a hope
of getting out of their clutches.

01:00:54.779 --> 01:00:59.743
Not a hope. And even then you'll need
a lot of help from the outside.

01:00:59.868 --> 01:01:02.871
- (Advocate) Leni!
- (Max) Josef!

01:01:03.663 --> 01:01:06.625
- Josef!
- Leni, where are you? Leni, darling?

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:11.379
Max is leaving.
I want the keys for the door.

01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:13.840
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:01:13.965 --> 01:01:17.677
Albert, go on with what you were saying
about advocates.

01:01:17.803 --> 01:01:20.514
Oh, they do everything they can
to discourage us.

01:01:20.639 --> 01:01:24.643
You should see the room
they have for advocates.

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:28.939
No ventilation.
Just a tiny skylight up high.

01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:33.693
You have to have some other advocate
to hoist you up on his back.

01:01:33.819 --> 01:01:38.281
For more than a year now
there's been a hole in the floor!

01:01:38.406 --> 01:01:42.994
If you stumble into it, your leg hangs
down into the corridor below.

01:01:43.119 --> 01:01:46.873
- Very embarrassing with a client.
- I had no idea of the difficulties.

01:01:46.998 --> 01:01:49.459
Yes, it's all...

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.339
...very humiliating.

01:01:54.464 --> 01:01:58.343
I only wish
my nephew could be hearing all this.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.062
(Storm rages)

01:02:28.456 --> 01:02:30.208
- Who's that man?
- What man?

01:02:30.333 --> 01:02:33.086
- That man in there.
- You shouldn't have opened that door.

01:02:34.171 --> 01:02:37.424
- Well, who is he?
- He doesn't matter. Come here.

01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:40.135
What do you mean he doesn't matter?

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.929
Oh, no, no. I've got to go.

01:02:44.598 --> 01:02:46.641
All right.

01:02:46.766 --> 01:02:51.104
These are the back stairs. You'd better
pretend you were waiting in the street.

01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:56.026
Say you'd begun to feel faint
and needed some fresh air.

01:02:56.151 --> 01:03:00.155
- What's he doing in there?
- Waiting. He's a client.

01:03:01.948 --> 01:03:03.408
Here's your key.

01:03:08.205 --> 01:03:10.248
(Advocate) Leni?

01:03:19.382 --> 01:03:21.218
Josef! Well?

01:03:21.343 --> 01:03:24.387
- Well what?
- You know she's the Advocate's mistress?

01:03:24.513 --> 01:03:27.891
You're facing a criminal charge.
Do you want to make enemies?

01:03:28.016 --> 01:03:29.976
Do you want to lose your case?

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:54.417
Looking for somebody?

01:03:54.543 --> 01:03:57.546
What's wrong? Isn't the court in session?

01:03:57.671 --> 01:04:00.590
- Not today.
- Why isn't the court in session?

01:04:00.715 --> 01:04:02.634
- It'll be sitting tomorrow.
- Are you sure?

01:04:02.759 --> 01:04:05.846
- My husband's a guard here.
- The man who was kissing you?

01:04:05.971 --> 01:04:09.391
That wasn't my husband!

01:04:09.516 --> 01:04:12.144
That was a law student,
but even so he's got influence.

01:04:12.269 --> 01:04:14.688
- Influence, huh?
- He's important.

01:04:14.813 --> 01:04:18.483
He must be. You were making love
in the middle of the crowd.

01:04:18.608 --> 01:04:22.195
I guess we ruined your speech,
but what could I do about it?

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.408
Once he gets started, it's...
Hey! You can't touch those books!

01:04:26.533 --> 01:04:29.119
- They belong to the Examining Magistrate.
- We'll see.

01:04:29.244 --> 01:04:31.997
It's not my fault. It's the rules.

01:04:32.914 --> 01:04:37.836
You do remember me, don't you?
From last night? My name is Hilda.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:41.548
These are probably law books.
I mustn't read any law.

01:04:41.673 --> 01:04:46.052
I must be condemned not only
in ignorance... How dirty they are.

01:04:52.225 --> 01:04:53.935
Oh, they really are dirty.

01:04:58.231 --> 01:05:00.901
And these are the men
that sit in judgment on me!

01:05:01.026 --> 01:05:03.236
Listen, I'll help you.

01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:07.574
- Wouldn't you like me to?
- How, if your husband's a guard here?

01:05:07.699 --> 01:05:11.453
I want to help you.
That's why I came in here.

01:05:11.578 --> 01:05:15.749
- Even though it's forbidden.
- I wouldn't want you to get in trouble.

01:05:15.874 --> 01:05:18.460
No, you mustn't go away like that.

01:05:18.585 --> 01:05:22.589
Not yet. You've got
the wrong ideas about me.

01:05:22.714 --> 01:05:27.594
Am I such a nothing in your eyes
that you won't stay just a little longer?

01:05:27.719 --> 01:05:32.015
Well, I've got plenty of time. I only came
thinking the court would be in session.

01:05:32.849 --> 01:05:36.311
You mustn't be offended when I ask you
not to do anything about my case.

01:05:36.436 --> 01:05:40.273
I don't care at all how it comes out.
If they sentence me, I'll just laugh.

01:05:40.398 --> 01:05:45.445
Not that it'll ever come to that.
They might hope to get money out of me,

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:48.281
but they're wasting their time.

01:05:48.406 --> 01:05:53.328
You could tell that Examining Magistrate
that nothing could induce me to give money

01:05:53.453 --> 01:05:56.206
to those precious judges. Nope.

01:05:56.331 --> 01:06:00.043
But you said the only ones who could
do you any good were the higher-ups.

01:06:00.168 --> 01:06:01.962
I'm afraid so.

01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:06.216
He's always writing reports.
They must go up to the real authorities.

01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:12.764
Last night, when the others had left,
he stayed on here real late, writing away.

01:06:12.889 --> 01:06:15.308
I had to bring him a candle.

01:06:15.433 --> 01:06:20.063
Then my husband came home and
started to move furniture back in place,

01:06:20.188 --> 01:06:23.733
neighbours came in with some beer
and we got to talking by candlelight

01:06:23.859 --> 01:06:27.487
and we just forgot about
the Examining Magistrate altogether.

01:06:28.655 --> 01:06:33.118
Then, in the middle of the night, I woke
up and there he was standing by our bed

01:06:33.243 --> 01:06:36.997
and shielding the candle with his hand
to keep the light from my husband.

01:06:37.122 --> 01:06:38.665
Not that he needed to bother.

01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:42.252
Once my husband gets to sleep,
nothing wakes him.

01:06:42.377 --> 01:06:47.257
I was so startled, I almost let out
a yell, but the Magistrate was real kind.

01:06:47.382 --> 01:06:50.719
He whispered he'd been in there
all the time, writing,

01:06:50.844 --> 01:06:54.931
and now he'd come to return the candle,
and as long as he lived

01:06:55.056 --> 01:06:57.559
he'd never forget the picture I'd made.

01:06:57.684 --> 01:07:02.647
That's what he said. The picture
I made lying asleep in the bed.

01:07:02.772 --> 01:07:06.151
He's so busy writing
these great, long reports.

01:07:06.276 --> 01:07:10.530
The one last night must have been
about you. And somebody must read it.

01:07:10.655 --> 01:07:12.866
Besides, he's starting
to take an interest in me.

01:07:13.825 --> 01:07:16.077
Maybe I could do you some good, eh?

01:07:16.203 --> 01:07:19.498
This morning
he sent me a pair of stockings.

01:07:19.623 --> 01:07:21.625
Look, I've got them on now.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:23.877
Look out.

01:07:24.002 --> 01:07:26.004
- It's Bert.
- Bert?

01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:30.425
I know. He's ugly.
Did you get a look at those legs of his?

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.928
All the same, I gotta go and be with him.

01:07:33.053 --> 01:07:37.140
I'll come back soon.
Then I'll go with you wherever you like

01:07:37.265 --> 01:07:39.893
and you can do with me whatever you want.

01:07:40.018 --> 01:07:42.562
What's wrong? Don't you believe me?

01:07:44.356 --> 01:07:45.982
Why should I?

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:48.985
This could be a trap.

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:53.114
- (Whispers) Are you afraid?
- Who is this law student? A henchman?

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:56.034
- What of it?
- I-I-I-I was thinking.

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.370
Don't think.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:06.586
It would be kind of a nice revenge
to take you away from both of them.

01:08:06.711 --> 01:08:08.255
Why not?

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.342
Then some night after the Magistrate
has been staying up late

01:08:12.467 --> 01:08:17.013
filling out those long, lying reports
about me, he'd come to your bedside

01:08:17.139 --> 01:08:18.765
and he would...

01:08:27.357 --> 01:08:29.359
Why don't you go?

01:08:29.484 --> 01:08:32.946
- You should have left when I came in.
- You think so?

01:08:33.071 --> 01:08:35.115
That's what you're supposed to do.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.201
When I come in,
you get the hell out of here.

01:08:39.618 --> 01:08:41.453
Well...

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:46.417
I seem to detect the insolence
of a future official of the court.

01:08:46.542 --> 01:08:51.381
You shouldn't be allowed to run around.
That was a mistake. I told the Magistrate.

01:08:51.506 --> 01:08:55.385
- Come on.
- Don't try to be funny! Come on!

01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:59.930
Wait a minute!

01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:03.310
- It's no use!
- What do you mean?

01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:06.729
He sent for me! The Examining Magistrate.

01:09:06.854 --> 01:09:11.026
- The Examining Magistrate?!
- He won't let me go!

01:09:14.863 --> 01:09:17.491
Sorry! What can I do?!

01:09:22.953 --> 01:09:25.832
- Now listen...
- Leave him! You want to ruin me?

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:28.710
He's obeying the Examining Magistrate.

01:09:28.835 --> 01:09:32.296
All right. Take her to him!
You lied to me.

01:09:32.421 --> 01:09:35.716
- Why should I lie?
- Being taken to the Magistrate?

01:09:35.841 --> 01:09:40.639
- Yes, I am!
- He's waiting in a place like that?!

01:09:40.764 --> 01:09:44.017
Of course he is! These are the law court
offices. Where else would he be?

01:09:44.142 --> 01:09:47.020
Law court offices? In a place like...?

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:51.817
Hell!

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:16.550
- You're the defendant?
- My name is K.

01:10:17.634 --> 01:10:20.512
You're... the court room guard.

01:10:20.637 --> 01:10:22.931
Yes, I'm her husband.

01:10:23.056 --> 01:10:24.891
It's Sunday night.

01:10:27.561 --> 01:10:29.479
I'm not supposed to work on Sunday night.

01:10:30.188 --> 01:10:33.108
But just to get me out of the way
they send me off

01:10:33.233 --> 01:10:35.819
on these long, useless errands.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.822
That student.

01:10:39.698 --> 01:10:42.200
If my job didn't depend on it,

01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:46.580
I would have squashed him flat
against the wall here long ago.

01:10:47.581 --> 01:10:51.376
Right there.
Just a little bit above the floor.

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.463
All splashed in blood

01:10:54.588 --> 01:10:57.799
with his arms and his fingers

01:10:57.924 --> 01:11:01.178
and those bandy legs of his
all twisted out

01:11:01.303 --> 01:11:06.099
and writhing...
like a smashed cockroach.

01:11:10.979 --> 01:11:13.565
He used to carry her off
for his own pleasure,

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:16.776
but now it's the Examining Magistrate!

01:11:16.902 --> 01:11:20.822
- Isn't she to blame as well?
- She throws herself at him.

01:11:20.947 --> 01:11:23.366
In my position, there is nothing I can do.

01:11:23.492 --> 01:11:28.205
But if somebody gave him a good thrashing,
just once, he's a coward, you know.

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:33.251
He'd never touch her again.
Only a man like you could do it.

01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:36.213
A man like me? What do you mean?

01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:38.840
- They've arrested you, haven't they?
- Yes.

01:11:38.965 --> 01:11:42.135
That just gives me more reason
to be afraid of him.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.889
- I heard about that speech of yours.
- What about it?

01:11:47.933 --> 01:11:51.186
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be afraid at all.

01:11:51.311 --> 01:11:54.231
I'm not. I'm not afraid,
not of him personally.

01:11:54.356 --> 01:11:59.569
I'm not afraid of any of them.
But he does have influence, so they say.

01:11:59.694 --> 01:12:01.571
God knows,
my case is prejudiced enough.

01:12:01.696 --> 01:12:03.573
None of our cases are prejudiced.

01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:06.326
Well, I'm afraid
I'd have to disagree with you about that.

01:12:07.577 --> 01:12:12.457
- But it wouldn't necessarily stop me.
- I'd be very grateful. Come.

01:12:12.582 --> 01:12:14.000
Come.

01:12:32.477 --> 01:12:34.771
These are the law court officers.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:42.320
That's where they are,
my wife and the Magistrate.

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.953
I don't have a key for this one.

01:13:06.094 --> 01:13:07.929
Who are these people?

01:13:08.763 --> 01:13:10.223
The accused.

01:13:38.543 --> 01:13:41.296
- You. Why are you here?
- I'm waiting.

01:13:41.421 --> 01:13:44.800
- What are you waiting for?
- I handed in several affidavits.

01:13:44.925 --> 01:13:48.762
That was some time ago.
I'm waiting here for the result.

01:13:48.887 --> 01:13:53.141
- You're taking a good deal of trouble.
- Yes, you see, it's my case.

01:13:53.266 --> 01:13:56.728
What makes you think
that kind of thing is necessary?

01:13:56.853 --> 01:14:01.691
I can't say exactly,
but I handed in my affidavits.

01:14:01.817 --> 01:14:06.238
- You don't believe I'm under arrest.
- Oh, yes, certainly.

01:14:06.363 --> 01:14:09.324
Why not?
Why don't you believe I'm under arrest?

01:14:12.285 --> 01:14:15.038
What do you take me for?

01:14:15.163 --> 01:14:16.957
You think I'm a judge?

01:14:28.135 --> 01:14:30.887
Back to your seats, all of you!
Keep the passage clear!

01:14:36.685 --> 01:14:39.729
Can you tell me how to get out of here?
I've had enough of this place.

01:14:39.855 --> 01:14:43.650
You're going already?
But you've hardly seen anything yet.

01:14:43.775 --> 01:14:46.403
I don't want to.
I just want to get out of here.

01:14:46.528 --> 01:14:49.614
Well, you keep to the right
through that passage...

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:54.119
...and then you go to the second corner

01:14:54.244 --> 01:14:56.746
and then left along the lobby
to the fourth.

01:14:56.872 --> 01:14:58.540
You'd better show me yourself.

01:14:58.665 --> 01:15:01.376
There are so many passages
and lobbies, I'll never find the way.

01:15:01.501 --> 01:15:03.753
I've got a message to deliver
and I've lost a lot of time.

01:15:03.879 --> 01:15:05.881
- Come with me!
- Not so loud.

01:15:06.006 --> 01:15:08.091
You want to bring the officials
down on us?

01:15:08.216 --> 01:15:11.178
If they ask who you are, you'll have
to admit you're one of the accused.

01:15:11.303 --> 01:15:14.222
I'm not trying to hide it.

01:15:14.347 --> 01:15:17.017
- What will I tell them?
- The truth maybe.

01:15:17.142 --> 01:15:19.311
I only came here because I wanted to see

01:15:19.436 --> 01:15:23.857
if the inside of this famous legal system
was as loathsome as I guessed it was.

01:15:23.982 --> 01:15:27.360
And now I'm too depressed
to want to see anything more.

01:15:27.486 --> 01:15:30.238
I just want to get out of here
and be alone.

01:16:01.394 --> 01:16:03.647
- What's wrong? You feel a little dizzy?
- Yes.

01:16:03.772 --> 01:16:07.609
Don't worry. Almost everybody has
an attack like that on their first visit.

01:16:07.734 --> 01:16:11.279
It's the air. Then all sorts of washing
is hung up here to dry.

01:16:11.404 --> 01:16:14.574
You can't forbid the tenants
to wash their dirty linen.

01:16:14.699 --> 01:16:17.953
There's just nothing
we can do about that, I'm afraid.

01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:20.580
Where are you going?

01:16:26.419 --> 01:16:30.423
- You want to be taken to the sick room?
- Please don't trouble yourself. I...

01:16:32.175 --> 01:16:34.386
I'd feel fine
if I could just get some air.

01:16:34.511 --> 01:16:36.304
It's not far now.

01:16:36.429 --> 01:16:38.765
Here's the door right in front of you.

01:16:40.976 --> 01:16:43.145
Why don't you go out?
That's what you wanted.

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:45.480
Yes. Thank you.

01:16:50.986 --> 01:16:53.446
I'm not used to the fresh air.

01:17:09.171 --> 01:17:11.173
(Bells chime)

01:17:17.888 --> 01:17:19.723
Hello.

01:17:19.848 --> 01:17:22.434
Irmie! What are you doing here?

01:17:22.559 --> 01:17:25.896
- Well, I've been looking for you.
- But why?

01:17:26.021 --> 01:17:28.023
Uncle Max, I suppose, checking up on me.

01:17:28.148 --> 01:17:30.358
He keeps writing, nagging at me for news.

01:17:30.484 --> 01:17:33.320
He hasn't heard a thing about your case
for a long time now.

01:17:33.445 --> 01:17:35.614
So naturally, he's worried. We all are.

01:17:35.739 --> 01:17:37.782
Well, tell him not to worry.

01:17:38.533 --> 01:17:41.786
Gee, I gotta write something.
Just something.

01:17:41.912 --> 01:17:44.873
- Tell him everything's under control.
- But is it?

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:47.209
I don't know. I...

01:17:47.334 --> 01:17:50.712
I hate to be a drag, but you know
how he carries on about things -

01:17:50.837 --> 01:17:53.590
now it's the honour of the family
and all that jazz!

01:17:53.715 --> 01:17:56.134
- Maybe he's right.
- Oh, sh...

01:17:58.094 --> 01:18:01.431
I hope you didn't say what I thought you did.
You shouldn't use that language.

01:18:01.556 --> 01:18:04.518
- How old are you, anyway?
- 16, practically.

01:18:04.643 --> 01:18:07.604
You're 15. You certainly shouldn't
have come out here alone.

01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:10.607
I wouldn't be here if you hadn't got
in trouble with the law.

01:18:10.732 --> 01:18:13.151
- Don't they check up on you at school?
- They try to.

01:18:13.276 --> 01:18:16.404
- You sneak out after hours?
- You're not the only crook in the family.

01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:18.865
- That's not funny.
- OK, you write home

01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:21.409
and say what a delinquent I am,
but what do I say about you?

01:18:21.535 --> 01:18:23.620
There must be some kind of news.

01:18:24.788 --> 01:18:26.373
Well, I...

01:18:26.498 --> 01:18:30.919
I'm thinking of getting rid of your
father's old school chum. Tell him that.

01:18:31.044 --> 01:18:35.298
The famous advocate Hastler isn't doing
anything, except encourage the delay.

01:18:35.423 --> 01:18:38.760
But he's your lawyer.
How can you get rid of your lawyer?

01:18:38.885 --> 01:18:41.263
Easy. Just dismiss him from the case.

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:45.433
- And then what?
- I don't know.

01:18:46.351 --> 01:18:48.311
Isn't there something more definite
I can write home about?

01:18:48.436 --> 01:18:50.313
- No.
- You've got to have a lawyer.

01:18:50.438 --> 01:18:52.566
Influence is all that counts
in the long run.

01:18:52.691 --> 01:18:56.987
Hastler always brags about his personal
connections, but what's he really up to?

01:18:57.112 --> 01:19:00.532
I'm not stupid. I can defend myself.
Look at the position I've got at the office.

01:19:00.657 --> 01:19:05.078
Don't be surprised if you hear I've become
deputy manager of my entire department.

01:19:05.203 --> 01:19:08.665
All I've got to do is apply those
same abilities to this case of mine.

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:10.917
If I get rid of the Advocate,
I can draw up my own plan

01:19:11.042 --> 01:19:13.420
and keep after the officials myself.

01:19:14.254 --> 01:19:17.549
- This is where I leave you, Irmie.
- You're not going to work now?

01:19:17.674 --> 01:19:20.635
Things keep piling up.
This case is taking such a lot of my time.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:24.306
I've got to finish my work somehow.
I ought to walk you back to your school.

01:19:24.431 --> 01:19:26.433
That's all I need -
to be seen with a man!

01:19:26.558 --> 01:19:29.269
- But I'm your cousin.
- Cousins get married.

01:19:29.394 --> 01:19:32.564
- You wouldn't want to marry a criminal.
- Crooks get married, too.

01:19:34.065 --> 01:19:36.193
- So long now.
- So long, Josef.

01:19:55.587 --> 01:19:57.589
(He whispers) It's him.

01:20:00.008 --> 01:20:01.885
- Who are you?
- My name is Block.

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:04.638
- Are you employed here?
- No, I'm only a client.

01:20:04.763 --> 01:20:07.182
I don't belong to the house.
I'm here on business.

01:20:07.307 --> 01:20:09.392
- In your shirt sleeves?
- Excuse me, please.

01:20:09.518 --> 01:20:13.063
- Have you been making love to Leni?
- No. No!

01:20:13.188 --> 01:20:16.399
You look like an honest man.
What did you say your name was? Block?

01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:17.943
Yes, Block.

01:20:18.068 --> 01:20:21.363
- That's your real name?
- Of course. Why shouldn't it be?

01:20:21.488 --> 01:20:25.408
I don't know. You might have
some reason for concealing it.

01:20:30.872 --> 01:20:33.166
- Do you know who that is?
- Yes, a judge.

01:20:33.291 --> 01:20:36.628
- A judge of the high court?
- Yes, it must be.

01:20:36.753 --> 01:20:40.173
That shows how much you know.
Among judges that's the lowest of the low.

01:20:40.298 --> 01:20:43.844
Yes. Yes, of course, now I remember.
I've been told about that before.

01:20:43.969 --> 01:20:46.763
You've been told all about that before.
Of course you have.

01:20:46.888 --> 01:20:48.890
Yes, sir, I have been told this.

01:20:49.015 --> 01:20:51.685
Where is she now?
Come on, where's Leni?

01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:53.770
Where is she hiding?

01:20:53.895 --> 01:20:56.648
I don't think she's hiding, sir.
She must be in the kitchen.

01:20:56.773 --> 01:21:00.986
Yes, that's where she ought to be.
She must be making soup for the Advocate.

01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:03.280
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm taking you there.

01:21:03.405 --> 01:21:06.533
- Don't think you're being clever.
- I don't think I'm clever at all.

01:21:06.658 --> 01:21:08.493
Lead the way then.

01:21:09.161 --> 01:21:10.787
Go on.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.669
- Good evening, Josef.
- Leni...

01:21:26.386 --> 01:21:29.014
- Who's that man?
- His name is Block.

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.311
You were in your nightgown.

01:21:36.062 --> 01:21:38.064
Is he your lover?

01:21:38.773 --> 01:21:40.942
I want an answer!

01:21:41.067 --> 01:21:43.695
Come to the study
and I'll tell you about it.

01:21:45.614 --> 01:21:47.491
No.

01:21:47.616 --> 01:21:49.910
No, I want you to tell me in here.

01:21:50.577 --> 01:21:54.581
You aren't jealous of poor little Block?
You can see what he is - nothing.

01:21:54.706 --> 01:21:56.500
I just have to pay
a little attention to him

01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:59.795
because he is one
of the Advocate's best clients.

01:22:06.092 --> 01:22:09.721
- You're going to spend the night with me?
- The eggs are burning.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.228
It's just as well. Eggs are bad for you.

01:22:16.353 --> 01:22:19.189
If you really want to see the Advocate,
I'll tell him you're here.

01:22:19.314 --> 01:22:21.817
- He's been asking after you.
- I'll bet he has.

01:22:21.942 --> 01:22:24.194
Where have you been all this time?

01:22:25.111 --> 01:22:29.032
I've got some information for you, too.
Things I've found out.

01:22:29.157 --> 01:22:31.284
But first, let's get off that jacket.

01:22:31.409 --> 01:22:33.662
Shall I announce you
or give him his soup first?

01:22:33.787 --> 01:22:36.873
Give him his soup. He'll need it
by the time I'm through with him.

01:22:36.998 --> 01:22:39.459
So you are one
of the Advocate's clients?

01:22:39.584 --> 01:22:42.879
- What's it got to do with you?
- You be quiet, Rudy.

01:22:43.004 --> 01:22:46.299
I'll give him his soup now,
but he may fall asleep right afterwards.

01:22:46.424 --> 01:22:48.510
What I have to say to him
will keep him awake.

01:22:48.635 --> 01:22:50.762
As soon as he's finished eating,
I'll announce you.

01:22:50.887 --> 01:22:53.807
- I want to get you back with me.
- Keep your seat.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.019
So...

01:23:01.439 --> 01:23:03.233
You're, uh...

01:23:03.942 --> 01:23:07.404
- You're one of the Advocate's clients?
- Oh, yes.

01:23:07.529 --> 01:23:10.574
Yes, a very old client indeed.

01:23:10.699 --> 01:23:12.993
How long has he had charge
of your affairs?

01:23:13.118 --> 01:23:15.662
Affairs? Business affairs?

01:23:15.787 --> 01:23:19.791
Oh, he's been my representative
since the very beginning.

01:23:22.169 --> 01:23:26.173
But my case, that's what probably
you're thinking about.

01:23:26.298 --> 01:23:28.925
I have it all written down here.

01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:31.052
I can give you the exact dates.

01:23:31.178 --> 01:23:34.389
It's very difficult to keep all that
in one's head, so...

01:23:34.514 --> 01:23:39.436
I never realised that Hastler had
an ordinary commercial practice as well.

01:23:39.561 --> 01:23:41.062
Of course.

01:23:41.188 --> 01:23:44.024
Why, yes, you know that they even say...

01:23:45.484 --> 01:23:50.322
They even say that he's a better advocate
for business than for the other kind.

01:23:50.447 --> 01:23:52.532
- Yes?
- Oh, yes.

01:23:52.657 --> 01:23:54.284
You won't give me away?

01:23:55.535 --> 01:23:57.454
I'm not an informer.

01:23:58.622 --> 01:24:01.750
He's a revengeful man, very revengeful.

01:24:03.293 --> 01:24:07.172
Surely he wouldn't... He wouldn't think
of harming one of his own clients?

01:24:07.297 --> 01:24:08.715
Yes, yes.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.885
Yes, once he's aroused, he'll do anything.

01:24:12.761 --> 01:24:15.555
He doesn't draw any distinctions.

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.682
What was it you wanted to tell me?

01:24:18.767 --> 01:24:22.103
You'll have to tell me
one of your own secrets.

01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:23.855
Please.

01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:26.775
So we can trust each other to keep quiet.

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:29.027
OK, I'll give you something.

01:24:37.077 --> 01:24:39.246
I have other advocates.

01:24:40.372 --> 01:24:45.502
- Other advocates as well as Hastler?
- Five of them.

01:24:45.627 --> 01:24:47.629
(He sniggers)

01:24:47.754 --> 01:24:49.589
You know...

01:24:50.382 --> 01:24:52.342
- (Both laugh)
- Hastler...

01:24:56.972 --> 01:24:59.307
- Listen...
- Yeah?

01:24:59.432 --> 01:25:01.685
Hastler, yes...

01:25:02.519 --> 01:25:04.855
- You notice he's always...
- (Laughter)

01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:06.982
Ssh! Wait a minute.

01:25:08.316 --> 01:25:13.530
Hastler is always referring to the others
in his own circle as great advocates.

01:25:14.823 --> 01:25:16.158
- No?
- No.

01:25:16.283 --> 01:25:18.285
- No?
- Of course not.

01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:22.831
- But in the real protocol of the court...
- Yeah?

01:25:23.915 --> 01:25:26.376
- He ranks where?
- Where?

01:25:26.501 --> 01:25:30.255
Among the small advocates. For sure.

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:32.632
Hastler?

01:25:32.757 --> 01:25:36.386
Well, the real great advocates
whom I've never seen...

01:25:36.511 --> 01:25:39.014
- You were working on your own behalf?
- Oh, yes.

01:25:39.139 --> 01:25:41.099
I'd like to ask you about that.

01:25:41.224 --> 01:25:43.310
- How do you do that?
- It's exhausting.

01:25:44.269 --> 01:25:47.898
It's just that they need a court
to try to keep an eye on things.

01:25:48.023 --> 01:25:49.524
Too much for one man.

01:25:53.236 --> 01:25:56.615
I'll be there often enough myself
after this, I suppose.

01:25:56.740 --> 01:25:59.576
I can't expect the special treatment
I got the first time.

01:25:59.701 --> 01:26:02.370
Everybody stood up.
They must have taken me for a judge.

01:26:02.496 --> 01:26:05.373
It was the guard you were with.

01:26:05.499 --> 01:26:08.043
He's the one we all stood up for.

01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:11.505
- There's that ridiculous superstition.
- What superstition?

01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:14.633
You're supposed to be able to tell
from a man's face,

01:26:14.758 --> 01:26:18.094
and from the line
of his lips especially,

01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.181
how his case is going to turn out.

01:26:21.306 --> 01:26:22.307
So?

01:26:22.432 --> 01:26:26.311
So people were saying
that from the expression on your lips,

01:26:26.436 --> 01:26:29.815
they could tell
that you'll be found guilty.

01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:33.401
- Yes, in the very near future.
- The Advocate is waiting for you.

01:26:33.527 --> 01:26:36.696
- Let him wait!
- Talk to Block later. He's sleeping here.

01:26:36.822 --> 01:26:39.449
- Sleeping here?
- Everybody isn't like you...

01:26:41.159 --> 01:26:45.080
Expecting to be granted an interview
at any hour of the day or night!

01:26:46.289 --> 01:26:48.625
And the Advocate sick as he is, too.

01:26:54.422 --> 01:26:57.968
Your friends do you favours
and you just take them for granted.

01:26:59.928 --> 01:27:01.930
Not that I ask for any thanks.

01:27:02.848 --> 01:27:05.100
All I want...

01:27:05.225 --> 01:27:08.645
Well, I want you to be fond of me.

01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:10.897
I'm fond of you.

01:27:12.065 --> 01:27:15.068
I don't know. Why shouldn't Hastler
be willing to see me?

01:27:15.193 --> 01:27:18.405
He's my lawyer, isn't he?
What kind of a favour is that?

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:21.950
- That's not the question...
- It's his day for being difficult.

01:27:24.369 --> 01:27:28.957
Do you know why the Advocate has agreed
to see him, Leni? It's because...

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.004
...his case is still at a hopeful stage.
Oh, yes, Leni.

01:27:34.796 --> 01:27:38.717
- He'll see the difference later on.
- You talk too much.

01:27:38.842 --> 01:27:41.052
That's his trouble.

01:27:41.178 --> 01:27:43.555
That's why the Advocate can't bear
to see him.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:44.973
Oh...

01:27:45.098 --> 01:27:47.809
Oh, he does see me occasionally.

01:27:48.602 --> 01:27:52.314
But you never know.
That's what's so nerve-wracking.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.902
You never know
when he'll be willing to receive you.

01:27:57.819 --> 01:28:00.530
It could be any time - day, night.

01:28:00.655 --> 01:28:02.991
And if I'm not right here on the spot

01:28:03.116 --> 01:28:06.620
when he does take it into his head
to send for me,

01:28:06.745 --> 01:28:08.872
I've lost my chance.

01:28:10.582 --> 01:28:13.460
Then I have to wait much longer
than before.

01:28:13.585 --> 01:28:15.879
That's why I let you sleep here.

01:28:16.588 --> 01:28:20.801
Well, I guess one gets very dependent
on one's advocate as time goes on.

01:28:20.926 --> 01:28:23.720
Well, the truth is he likes it.

01:28:23.845 --> 01:28:26.681
- Leni...
- Maybe not the waiting.

01:28:26.807 --> 01:28:29.976
But you do enjoy spending the night,
now, don't you?

01:28:30.769 --> 01:28:32.145
Good.

01:28:35.357 --> 01:28:37.192
Want to see his room?

01:28:43.865 --> 01:28:45.242
OK.

01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:57.379
So you sleep in the maid's room?

01:28:57.504 --> 01:29:00.257
Yeah, she lets me have it, yes.

01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:02.384
It's very convenient.

01:29:10.475 --> 01:29:12.477
(She sighs)

01:29:19.609 --> 01:29:21.444
Put him to bed.

01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:23.238
Mr K, wait!

01:29:23.363 --> 01:29:25.657
- Wait, Mr K!
- Rudy!

01:29:25.782 --> 01:29:27.826
Mr K! Mr K!

01:29:27.951 --> 01:29:30.704
Please... You forgot your promise.

01:29:30.829 --> 01:29:33.874
You were going to tell me
one of your secrets.

01:29:34.916 --> 01:29:39.296
All right, I'll give you a secret.
I'm dismissing the Advocate.

01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:41.256
- The Advocate?
- What?

01:29:41.381 --> 01:29:43.633
I'm going to dismiss him from my case.

01:29:43.758 --> 01:29:46.761
I'm tired of all these delays.
Hastler's done nothing.

01:29:46.887 --> 01:29:49.556
- No, you can't.
- He's too old, sick or indifferent.

01:29:49.681 --> 01:29:52.601
- He's not indifferent.
- He's dismissing the Advocate.

01:29:52.726 --> 01:29:55.270
- Wait!
- He's dismissing the Advocate!

01:29:56.062 --> 01:29:58.899
(Screams) No, Josef!

01:29:59.024 --> 01:30:01.276
(Screams) You stay out!

01:30:04.279 --> 01:30:05.655
Please! (Screams)

01:30:06.031 --> 01:30:07.866
Leave him alone, Leni.

01:30:09.784 --> 01:30:12.871
- Has she been pestering you again?
- Pestering me?

01:30:12.996 --> 01:30:16.750
She finds all accused men attractive.

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:19.878
It's a peculiarity of hers.

01:30:22.130 --> 01:30:26.134
She makes up to all of them,
makes love to all of them.

01:30:26.259 --> 01:30:29.054
And when I allow her to,

01:30:29.179 --> 01:30:32.682
she tells me about these affairs
to amuse me.

01:30:34.476 --> 01:30:37.062
All about them.

01:30:37.187 --> 01:30:39.773
You came here this evening
for a specific reason?

01:30:39.898 --> 01:30:42.609
Yes, to tell you
that I'm dispensing with your services.

01:30:42.734 --> 01:30:44.653
We mustn't be in too much of a hurry.

01:30:44.778 --> 01:30:47.531
You've done everything you can for me
and I appreciate it,

01:30:47.656 --> 01:30:50.700
but more energetic steps
will have to be taken.

01:30:50.826 --> 01:30:54.079
- That's a plan we can discuss.
- It's not a plan, it's a fact.

01:30:55.330 --> 01:30:57.457
How many times have I come here?
What have you done for me? Nothing.

01:30:57.582 --> 01:31:01.419
How many of my clients have reached
the same point in their cases as you

01:31:01.545 --> 01:31:05.549
and stood there before me
saying exactly the same things?

01:31:05.674 --> 01:31:10.595
Maybe they had a reason to. They were
probably as much in the right as I am.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:12.722
It's true, you know.

01:31:15.892 --> 01:31:19.980
Accused men... are attractive.

01:31:20.105 --> 01:31:23.775
Not that being accused
makes any immediate change

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:26.695
in a man's personal appearance.

01:31:28.905 --> 01:31:31.074
But if you've got the right eye
for these things,

01:31:31.199 --> 01:31:34.661
you can pick out an accused man
in the largest crowd.

01:31:35.704 --> 01:31:38.957
It's just something about them.
Something...

01:31:40.876 --> 01:31:42.586
...attractive.

01:31:42.711 --> 01:31:44.796
It can't be a sense of guilt.

01:31:46.131 --> 01:31:49.134
You can't all be... guilty.

01:31:50.385 --> 01:31:51.803
Hmm?

01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:55.390
Some are more attractive than others,

01:31:55.515 --> 01:31:59.811
but all are attractive,
even that wretched creature Block.

01:31:59.936 --> 01:32:04.774
Let's get him in here. It's time you
learnt how other accused men are treated.

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:06.443
Get Block in here, Leni.

01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:10.655
Go and fetch Block.

01:32:16.453 --> 01:32:19.789
- My decision is final.
- You'd better think about it, Josef.

01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:28.215
The Advocate wants to see you.

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:32.594
- Go on.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

01:32:35.305 --> 01:32:37.265
- Is that Block?
- Yes, sir.

01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:39.518
What do you want?

01:32:44.105 --> 01:32:47.108
- You were sent for, weren't you?
- Yes, sir, I was.

01:32:50.695 --> 01:32:54.324
- You've come at the wrong time.
- Sir, I came immediately.

01:32:54.449 --> 01:32:56.451
The minute I heard my name.

01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:02.207
- Do you want me to go away?
- You're here, aren't you?

01:33:02.332 --> 01:33:04.417
Yes, sir, I'm here. I...

01:33:05.544 --> 01:33:07.879
- Then stay.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:09.965 --> 01:33:14.344
Yesterday, I saw my friend,
the third judge.

01:33:14.469 --> 01:33:17.556
I managed to work the conversation
around to your case.

01:33:17.681 --> 01:33:20.100
- Do you want to hear what he said?
- Oh, please.

01:33:20.225 --> 01:33:24.479
In these matters,
there are so many conflicting opinions

01:33:24.604 --> 01:33:27.065
that the confusion is impenetrable.

01:33:27.190 --> 01:33:32.320
At a certain point by an old tradition,
a bell must be rung.

01:33:32.445 --> 01:33:34.114
Yes, a bell.

01:33:34.239 --> 01:33:38.243
The judge holds that this marks
the official opening of the proceedings.

01:33:38.994 --> 01:33:43.415
There are many arguments against this
opinion, but you wouldn't understand them.

01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:45.167
- Sir...
- No!

01:33:45.292 --> 01:33:47.294
- Who is your advocate?
- You.

01:33:47.419 --> 01:33:51.047
- And beside me?
- No one, sir. No one was...

01:33:51.173 --> 01:33:55.135
- Then pay no attention to anyone else.
- Fall on the floor for him if you like.

01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:59.473
No, you're not to talk to me like that.
Not in front of the Advocate.

01:33:59.598 --> 01:34:03.477
How dare you! How dare you!
How dare you!

01:34:04.436 --> 01:34:07.981
Don't you know he's trying
to humiliate you to show off his power?

01:34:08.106 --> 01:34:10.525
- Pay no attention to anyone.
- Let him go!

01:34:10.650 --> 01:34:13.028
Do what your conscience tells you
is right.

01:34:13.153 --> 01:34:15.572
- Let me go!
- I'm on my knees, Advocate.

01:34:15.697 --> 01:34:18.408
I'm on my knees, Advocate.
I'm on my knees, sir.

01:34:18.533 --> 01:34:20.452
I'm on...

01:34:20.577 --> 01:34:22.579
Huh? Oh...

01:34:48.313 --> 01:34:50.315
How has he been behaving today?

01:34:51.316 --> 01:34:53.568
He has been quiet and hardworking.

01:34:54.528 --> 01:34:56.696
What's he been doing all day?

01:34:57.864 --> 01:35:02.410
I kept him locked up in the maid's room,
so he wouldn't disturb me in my work.

01:35:02.536 --> 01:35:05.413
It's where he usually stays anyway.

01:35:05.539 --> 01:35:09.042
Then you can't say with your own
knowledge what he's been doing.

01:35:09.167 --> 01:35:12.254
I peeked in on him now and then
through the ventilator.

01:35:12.379 --> 01:35:15.298
He was kneeling all the time on his bed...

01:35:16.258 --> 01:35:18.343
studying the book you let him borrow.

01:35:18.468 --> 01:35:21.763
There wasn't much light,
so the way he stuck to his reading shows

01:35:21.888 --> 01:35:24.266
that he does what he's told.

01:35:24.391 --> 01:35:27.144
Did he understand what he was reading?

01:35:27.269 --> 01:35:30.230
Well, he was following the lines
with his fingers.

01:35:30.355 --> 01:35:35.068
All I could tell was he never goes
past the same page the whole day.

01:35:35.861 --> 01:35:38.071
I guess the book
is very hard to understand.

01:35:38.196 --> 01:35:40.073
Yes.

01:35:40.198 --> 01:35:42.909
The scriptures are very difficult.

01:35:43.869 --> 01:35:48.165
They're only meant to give him
a bare inkling of the complications

01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:50.333
I must struggle with on his behalf.

01:35:50.459 --> 01:35:54.296
- Did he read without stopping?
- Almost without stopping.

01:35:54.421 --> 01:35:56.214
Once he asked me for a drink of water

01:35:56.339 --> 01:35:59.092
and I handed it to him
through the ventilator.

01:35:59.217 --> 01:36:02.721
Then about eight o'clock, I let him out
and gave him something to eat.

01:36:02.846 --> 01:36:04.931
You're praising him too much, Leni.

01:36:05.056 --> 01:36:07.684
You're making it even harder for me
to tell him the truth.

01:36:08.518 --> 01:36:11.313
The judge's remarks were
by no means favourable.

01:36:11.438 --> 01:36:14.024
Not favourable? How can that be?

01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:16.943
He was even annoyed
when I mentioned Block's name.

01:36:17.068 --> 01:36:20.280
"You're wasting your time with that man,"
he told me.

01:36:20.405 --> 01:36:22.365
"His case is hopeless."

01:36:22.491 --> 01:36:27.245
I refused to believe that.
"Block is most conscientious," I told him.

01:36:28.163 --> 01:36:32.125
"It's true that personally
he's rather repulsive.

01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:35.086
"His manners are bad and he's dirty,

01:36:35.212 --> 01:36:40.967
"but as a client," I said,
"he's beyond reproach,"

01:36:41.092 --> 01:36:43.595
which was, of course,
a deliberate exaggeration.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.680
And here's what the judge replied to that:

01:36:45.806 --> 01:36:50.393
"Your client has a kind of low cunning.

01:36:51.353 --> 01:36:56.149
"He's learned through the years
how to go on manipulating the situation.

01:36:57.234 --> 01:37:00.403
"What do you think he'd say
if we were to tell him

01:37:00.529 --> 01:37:06.034
"that the bell marking
the start of the proceedings...

01:37:07.327 --> 01:37:09.746
"...hadn't even been rung?"

01:37:09.871 --> 01:37:11.873
- I...
- Quiet there, Block!

01:37:11.998 --> 01:37:15.460
Have you no shame
to behave like that in front of a client?

01:37:15.585 --> 01:37:19.005
You're destroying his confidence in me.
What's wrong with you?

01:37:19.131 --> 01:37:23.135
You're still alive, aren't you?
You're still under my protection.

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:26.096
I hope you realise
I'm dispensing with your services.

01:37:26.221 --> 01:37:28.473
You can still change your mind
about that.

01:37:28.598 --> 01:37:30.725
To be in chains...

01:37:30.851 --> 01:37:33.145
is sometimes safer than to be free.

01:37:37.858 --> 01:37:39.693
(He chuckles)

01:37:45.365 --> 01:37:47.576
(Laughter continues)

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.287
- Where do you think you're going?
- Open the door.

01:37:50.412 --> 01:37:52.706
- You must be crazy.
- Open the door!

01:37:52.831 --> 01:37:54.833
- There's no place for you to go.
- He's crazy.

01:37:54.958 --> 01:37:58.128
If I hadn't made up my mind,
that performance would have settled it.

01:37:58.253 --> 01:38:00.714
To think it was all put on for my benefit
to win me over!

01:38:00.839 --> 01:38:04.092
How far do you think you could get
without him?

01:38:04.217 --> 01:38:06.344
How far am I now?

01:38:07.137 --> 01:38:10.390
- Not far away.
- You'd better see <i>him</i>.

01:38:12.476 --> 01:38:15.061
- The high court judge?
- Don't be funny. Of course not.

01:38:15.187 --> 01:38:19.357
I mean Titorelli. He's the official
court painter. He knows them all.

01:38:19.483 --> 01:38:21.902
They all come to his studio
to sit for their portraits.

01:38:22.027 --> 01:38:24.905
Nobody has more influence with the judges
than Titorelli.

01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:28.366
- You really think he could help me?
- That's his profession.

01:38:28.492 --> 01:38:31.244
- As much as painting, helping people.
- Unlock the door.

01:38:31.369 --> 01:38:33.205
- Wait till the morning.
- Where are the keys?

01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:35.790
The Advocate keeps the keys.

01:38:35.916 --> 01:38:37.292
OK...

01:38:38.502 --> 01:38:40.921
- Goodbye, Leni, and thanks.
- You'll be back here.

01:38:41.046 --> 01:38:43.173
- No, no.
- You won't have any choice.

01:38:43.298 --> 01:38:45.967
No, Leni, I've seen what it is
to be one of his clients.

01:38:46.092 --> 01:38:49.888
I've seen what happened to Block.
He's not a client. He's the Advocate's dog.

01:39:02.234 --> 01:39:03.902
(Whispering)

01:39:04.027 --> 01:39:06.613
- E-E-Excuse me, is there a Mr Titorelli?
- Who?

01:39:06.738 --> 01:39:09.032
An artist living here?

01:39:09.157 --> 01:39:12.160
- Do you know the painter Titorelli?
- What do you want him for?

01:39:12.285 --> 01:39:14.579
- I want him to paint my portrait.
- Your portrait?

01:39:14.704 --> 01:39:16.081
(Screaming)

01:39:55.412 --> 01:39:58.707
Just get in. I'll get rid of the girls.
Nasty little pests.

01:39:58.832 --> 01:40:01.168
Out! I see you!

01:40:01.293 --> 01:40:06.006
This is no time for your silly games!
The gentleman wants to talk business. Out!

01:40:06.131 --> 01:40:07.799
Out!

01:40:07.924 --> 01:40:10.177
Why can't you play
in somebody else's studio?

01:40:10.302 --> 01:40:12.095
I can see you!

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.396
I can see you.
Don't think you're fooling Titorelli!

01:40:21.521 --> 01:40:23.064
(Screaming)

01:40:24.774 --> 01:40:26.568
(Whispering)

01:40:28.153 --> 01:40:30.947
Out! Every last one of you!

01:40:31.072 --> 01:40:33.158
Get out of my studio!

01:40:34.868 --> 01:40:37.037
You really must apologise.

01:40:37.996 --> 01:40:39.706
Out! Out!

01:40:39.831 --> 01:40:43.376
Out! I got home late last night.
That's why everything is in such a mess.

01:40:43.502 --> 01:40:46.171
Just as I was tucking myself
under the covers,

01:40:46.296 --> 01:40:50.217
a dreadful little claw reaches up and
seizes me. She was under the bed waiting.

01:40:50.342 --> 01:40:53.428
- Titorelli, can we come in now?
- No, you can't!

01:40:53.553 --> 01:40:54.971
- Not even me?
- No!

01:40:55.096 --> 01:40:58.350
I know some little pussycats
who won't be so pretty

01:40:58.475 --> 01:41:00.727
when Titorelli is through with them.

01:41:00.852 --> 01:41:05.315
Some dirty-minded little pussies will wish
their mums had drowned them in a bucket!

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.276
I'll get my ice pick.
Remember my ice pick?

01:41:09.402 --> 01:41:11.404
Now what can I do for you, chum?

01:41:11.530 --> 01:41:14.616
I... I thought you might be able
to give me some advice.

01:41:14.741 --> 01:41:16.743
You wouldn't want to buy
one of my pictures?

01:41:16.868 --> 01:41:18.620
Oh, certainly.

01:41:18.745 --> 01:41:21.164
You're working on a painting now?

01:41:21.289 --> 01:41:23.542
A portrait, not quite finished.

01:41:23.667 --> 01:41:25.502
Oh. It must be a judge.

01:41:25.627 --> 01:41:27.963
Judges are my speciality.

01:41:28.088 --> 01:41:31.550
What... what does that repre... represent?

01:41:31.675 --> 01:41:34.136
You can see for yourself - justice.

01:41:34.261 --> 01:41:38.932
Yes, there's the... There's the bandage
over the eyes, but aren't those...

01:41:39.057 --> 01:41:41.852
Ouch! Aren't those wings there on heels?

01:41:41.977 --> 01:41:44.104
My instructions were to paint it that way.

01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:47.232
Flying? Justice ought to stand still,
don't you think?

01:41:47.357 --> 01:41:50.360
Or the scales will waver
and a just verdict won't be possible.

01:41:50.485 --> 01:41:55.323
It's justice and the goddess of victory
combined. What does she look like to you?

01:41:55.448 --> 01:41:58.869
Like the goddess of the hunt. In full cry.

01:42:00.036 --> 01:42:02.914
Titorelli, can we come in now?

01:42:03.039 --> 01:42:06.460
- Nasty thing, we're busy!
- You aren't really busy.

01:42:06.585 --> 01:42:11.465
You're going to paint him? Please don't
paint him. Not another one like that!

01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:14.384
- These girls belong to the court.
- What?

01:42:14.509 --> 01:42:18.388
Well, Joey, practically everything
belongs to the court.

01:42:19.306 --> 01:42:22.017
But it's behind the scenes,
here in this very studio,

01:42:22.142 --> 01:42:24.269
that's where you get your results.

01:42:24.394 --> 01:42:27.105
I forgot to ask you
what kind of acquittal you want.

01:42:27.230 --> 01:42:30.400
Ostensible or definite acquittal
or deferment?

01:42:30.525 --> 01:42:34.446
Definite acquittal is the best,
but I can't influence that kind of verdict.

01:42:34.571 --> 01:42:35.906
- Nobody can.
- Why?

01:42:36.031 --> 01:42:40.076
I've never in my life heard of a case
of definite acquittal. What's wrong?

01:42:40.202 --> 01:42:42.662
Is there a window,
something we can open?

01:42:42.787 --> 01:42:45.081
Plenty of air comes in
through those chinks.

01:42:45.207 --> 01:42:48.210
If you want some ventilation,
open that door behind you.

01:42:48.335 --> 01:42:51.087
The judge I'm painting now
always comes in by that door.

01:42:51.213 --> 01:42:53.632
I've had to give him a key for it
in case I happen to be out.

01:42:53.757 --> 01:42:57.594
His Honour usually arrives very early
when I'm still asleep.

01:42:57.719 --> 01:43:01.890
It's not exactly a soothing experience
to wake up in the morning and find a judge

01:43:02.015 --> 01:43:06.645
all dressed up in those crazy
ceremonial robes climbing over your bed!

01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:10.232
- He's taken off his jacket.
- They think I'll paint your portrait.

01:43:10.357 --> 01:43:14.569
- That's why you've taken off your jacket.
- What are the other alternatives?

01:43:14.694 --> 01:43:17.280
- Ah, you mean the legal alternatives?
- Yeah.

01:43:17.405 --> 01:43:21.952
I told you - ostensible acquittal
or indefinite deferment.

01:43:22.077 --> 01:43:25.080
- Deferment...
- What's wrong? Aren't you feeling well?

01:43:26.122 --> 01:43:27.499
No...

01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:30.418
Must... must... must be...

01:43:30.544 --> 01:43:32.671
the heat.

01:43:32.796 --> 01:43:35.590
If I open that door,
we'll have those girls all over us.

01:43:35.715 --> 01:43:38.927
- Don't do that.
- Well, now, with ostensible acquittal,

01:43:39.052 --> 01:43:41.263
I write out an affidavit of your innocence

01:43:41.388 --> 01:43:44.307
and make the rounds
of all the judges I know personally,

01:43:44.432 --> 01:43:46.893
beginning with the one I'm painting now.

01:43:47.018 --> 01:43:52.065
I explain to him that you're innocent
and myself guarantee that innocence...

01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:55.402
- And if he believes you?
- As he very well might.

01:43:55.527 --> 01:43:58.864
No, we mustn't be too pessimistic.

01:43:58.989 --> 01:44:01.533
Some of them are bound to believe me.

01:44:01.658 --> 01:44:04.119
Yes, and I'd be free?

01:44:04.244 --> 01:44:06.830
Ostensibly. Ostensibly free.

01:44:06.955 --> 01:44:10.167
Naturally, the judges I know
all belong to the lowest grade.

01:44:10.292 --> 01:44:15.088
They haven't the power reserved to
the highest court to grant a final acquittal.

01:44:15.213 --> 01:44:18.300
- The highest court?
- Chum, that court is inaccessible to you.

01:44:18.425 --> 01:44:23.722
To me, to all of us. What the prospects
are up there, well, we just don't know.

01:44:23.847 --> 01:44:27.017
And we don't want to know.
I'm sure you understand.

01:44:27.142 --> 01:44:30.353
- No, I'm not sure that I do.
- What they can do for you

01:44:30.479 --> 01:44:33.356
is to relieve you
of the burden of the charge,

01:44:33.482 --> 01:44:37.611
lift it from your shoulders for a time,
but it does hover up there above you.

01:44:37.736 --> 01:44:41.573
You see, in definite acquittal,
all the documents are annulled.

01:44:41.698 --> 01:44:45.410
But with ostensible acquittal,
your whole dossier continues to circulate.

01:44:45.535 --> 01:44:49.372
Up to the higher courts,
down to the lower ones, up again, down.

01:44:49.498 --> 01:44:52.834
These oscillations and peregrinations,
you just can't figure 'em.

01:44:52.959 --> 01:44:55.128
No use in trying either, I suppose.

01:44:55.253 --> 01:44:57.506
- Not a hope.
- (Josef laughs)

01:44:57.631 --> 01:45:00.467
I've known cases of an acquitted man
coming home from court

01:45:00.592 --> 01:45:03.804
and finding the cops waiting there
to arrest him all over again.

01:45:03.929 --> 01:45:07.933
But theoretically, it's always possible
to get another ostensible acquittal.

01:45:08.058 --> 01:45:10.310
The second acquittal
wouldn't be final either.

01:45:10.435 --> 01:45:13.104
It's automatically followed
by the third arrest,

01:45:13.230 --> 01:45:15.565
the third acquittal
by the fourth arrest...

01:45:15.690 --> 01:45:17.901
And so on.

01:45:18.026 --> 01:45:20.612
Do you think a deferment
would suit you any better?

01:45:21.363 --> 01:45:24.866
- I couldn't really say.
- You can't overlook a case for ever.

01:45:25.742 --> 01:45:27.744
Measures have to be taken.

01:45:27.869 --> 01:45:33.291
Questions, interrogations, observation,
more interrogations, evidence collected.

01:45:33.416 --> 01:45:37.295
- Going already?
- I'll be back to see you again very soon.

01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:40.090
I'll keep you to your word,
you know, Joey.

01:45:40.215 --> 01:45:43.343
Otherwise I'll call in at your office
and you wouldn't like that.

01:45:43.468 --> 01:45:45.387
Unlock this door, will you?

01:45:45.512 --> 01:45:49.724
You don't want to be bothered by the girls.
We'll slip you out this other way.

01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:51.768
- Now, wait.
- What for?

01:45:51.893 --> 01:45:53.895
Wouldn't you like to see
some of my pictures?

01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:57.816
I'm sure there's at least one or two
of them you'd want to buy.

01:45:57.941 --> 01:45:59.484
Here!

01:46:00.318 --> 01:46:02.904
It's modern, you know.
It's an action painting.

01:46:03.029 --> 01:46:05.157
I call it "Wild Nature - A Heath"...

01:46:05.282 --> 01:46:07.784
- I'll buy it.
- Here's the companion picture.

01:46:07.909 --> 01:46:10.662
- I'll take them both.
- You seem to like the subject.

01:46:10.787 --> 01:46:13.957
Yes, I do. I'II...
I'll hang them in my office.

01:46:14.082 --> 01:46:17.461
By a lucky chance,
I've got another on the very same theme.

01:46:17.586 --> 01:46:20.672
- How much for the three?
- We'll settle that the next time.

01:46:20.797 --> 01:46:24.593
Today, you're in such a hurry,
but we're going to keep in real close touch

01:46:24.718 --> 01:46:27.345
with each other from now on,
aren't we, Joey boy?

01:46:31.933 --> 01:46:33.935
This is the law court office.

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:35.896
That seems to surprise you.

01:46:36.021 --> 01:46:38.648
I think what surprises me most
is how ignorant I am

01:46:38.773 --> 01:46:41.485
about everything concerning
this court of yours.

01:46:41.610 --> 01:46:44.821
For an accused man, that's a mistake.
He should never be caught napping.

01:46:44.946 --> 01:46:47.032
Never for a minute
let his eyes stray to the left

01:46:47.157 --> 01:46:50.827
when, for all he knows,
a judge or somebody like that

01:46:50.952 --> 01:46:53.705
can be lurking a little bit to the right.

01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:55.957
Oh, you...

01:46:58.543 --> 01:47:01.546
I make...
I make you very uncomfortable, don't I?

01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:04.883
It distresses you
to find me in your company.

01:47:05.801 --> 01:47:07.677
Yes, I've been told about that.

01:47:07.803 --> 01:47:13.183
Before, I thought you took me for a judge
or at least an official of the court.

01:47:13.308 --> 01:47:17.229
I even thought you were afraid of me,
but what you're feeling is pain.

01:47:17.354 --> 01:47:19.731
You don't like what you see, do you?

01:47:19.856 --> 01:47:21.650
It's my mouth.

01:47:21.775 --> 01:47:26.071
You think you can tell from my mouth
that I'm condemned,

01:47:26.196 --> 01:47:27.989
that I'm going to be found guilty?

01:47:29.157 --> 01:47:31.618
- Guilty!
- (Children's voices echo)

01:47:31.743 --> 01:47:33.745
(Screaming)

01:48:17.873 --> 01:48:19.875
(Screaming continues)

01:48:26.965 --> 01:48:31.595
Josef K!

01:48:43.982 --> 01:48:45.984
- You are Josef K?
- Yes.

01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:48.236
You're an accused man?

01:48:48.361 --> 01:48:51.364
- So I've been informed.
- Your case is going badly.

01:48:55.911 --> 01:48:58.121
My first petition
hasn't been offered yet.

01:48:58.246 --> 01:49:00.749
Your guilt is assumed to have been proved.

01:49:00.874 --> 01:49:03.043
But I'm not guilty.

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.837
For that matter...

01:49:05.962 --> 01:49:08.256
how can any man be called guilty?

01:49:09.007 --> 01:49:11.885
We're all simply men here,
one as much as the other.

01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:14.554
The guilty always talk like that.

01:49:14.679 --> 01:49:16.765
What do you propose to do now?

01:49:18.141 --> 01:49:20.852
- Get more help.
- Help?

01:49:20.977 --> 01:49:23.605
There are several possibilities
I haven't explored yet.

01:49:23.730 --> 01:49:26.900
You expect too much from outside help,
especially from women.

01:49:27.025 --> 01:49:29.903
Women have influence.
Take that examining magistrate.

01:49:30.028 --> 01:49:32.155
If he sees a woman,
he'll climb over the bench

01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.991
and knock down the defendant
just to get his hands on her.

01:49:35.116 --> 01:49:37.869
That's an aspect of the courts
you probably don't know about.

01:49:37.994 --> 01:49:40.831
Where's the door? I have to catch up
with my work at the office.

01:49:41.498 --> 01:49:45.377
After all... I'm assistant manager
of my department.

01:49:45.502 --> 01:49:46.878
Josef...

01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:48.964
What are you doing in church?

01:49:49.089 --> 01:49:51.466
Am I still in church
or is this part of the law court offices?

01:49:51.591 --> 01:49:54.553
- I left my sick bed.
- Well, go back to your sick bed.

01:49:54.678 --> 01:49:57.347
You don't seriously believe
you can defend yourself?

01:49:57.472 --> 01:50:01.017
- Great choice. Defend myself or defy you.
- But defy the court?

01:50:01.143 --> 01:50:02.978
All of you. What's this?

01:50:03.103 --> 01:50:06.857
- We use these visual aids.
- Lectures and sermons.

01:50:06.982 --> 01:50:11.528
Yes, how your particular delusion
is described in the writings

01:50:11.653 --> 01:50:13.488
which preface the law.

01:50:13.613 --> 01:50:15.824
Before the law, there stands a guard.

01:50:15.949 --> 01:50:20.787
A man comes from the country
seeking admittance to the law,

01:50:20.912 --> 01:50:23.915
but the guard cannot admit him.

01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.251
Can the man hope to enter at a later time?

01:50:26.376 --> 01:50:28.753
I've heard it before.
We've all heard it.

01:50:28.879 --> 01:50:31.423
The man is dying of old age
still waiting there.

01:50:31.548 --> 01:50:35.177
And just at the end, the guard tells him
the door was meant only for him.

01:50:35.302 --> 01:50:39.222
The guard tells him,
"No one could enter this door.

01:50:39.347 --> 01:50:42.309
"And now I'm going to close it."

01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:45.520
Some commentators have pointed out

01:50:45.645 --> 01:50:49.524
that the man came to the door
of his own free will.

01:50:49.649 --> 01:50:52.152
We're supposed to swallow all that?
It's all true?

01:50:52.277 --> 01:50:56.907
We needn't accept everything as true,
only what's necessary.

01:50:57.032 --> 01:51:01.661
God, what a miserable conclusion!
It turns lying into a universal principle.

01:51:01.786 --> 01:51:03.788
By attempting to defy the court

01:51:03.914 --> 01:51:07.000
by such an obviously mad gesture,
you hope to plead insanity?

01:51:07.125 --> 01:51:10.962
You've laid some foundation for that claim
by appearing to believe yourself

01:51:11.087 --> 01:51:12.798
the victim of some kind of conspiracy.

01:51:12.923 --> 01:51:16.760
- That's a symptom of lunacy, isn't it?
- Delusions of persecution.

01:51:16.885 --> 01:51:19.054
- Delusions?
- Well...

01:51:19.179 --> 01:51:21.765
I don't pretend to be a martyr, no.

01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:25.101
Not even... a victim of society?

01:51:26.645 --> 01:51:28.814
I am a member of society.

01:51:29.898 --> 01:51:32.025
You think you can persuade the court

01:51:32.150 --> 01:51:34.778
that you're not responsible
by reason of lunacy?

01:51:34.903 --> 01:51:37.906
I think that's what the court
wants me to believe.

01:51:39.115 --> 01:51:41.117
Yes, that's the conspiracy.

01:51:41.243 --> 01:51:44.120
To persuade us all
that the whole world is crazy.

01:51:44.246 --> 01:51:48.542
Formless, meaningless, absurd.
That's the dirty game.

01:51:48.667 --> 01:51:51.628
So I've lost my case. What of it?

01:51:51.753 --> 01:51:54.172
You... You're losing, too.

01:51:55.173 --> 01:51:57.592
It's all lost. Lost!

01:51:57.717 --> 01:52:00.053
So what?

01:52:00.178 --> 01:52:03.807
Does that sentence
the entire universe to lunacy?

01:52:09.479 --> 01:52:11.314
Can't you see anything at all?

01:52:11.439 --> 01:52:13.441
Of course I'm responsible.

01:52:13.567 --> 01:52:15.527
My son...

01:52:17.696 --> 01:52:19.698
I am not your son.

01:56:18.019 --> 01:56:21.398
You expect me to take the knife
and do the job myself?

01:56:21.523 --> 01:56:24.025
No, you'll have to do it.

01:56:26.528 --> 01:56:41.710
You...

01:56:45.255 --> 01:56:48.800
You!

01:56:48.925 --> 01:56:51.845
You, you dummies!

01:56:51.970 --> 01:56:55.015
You'll have to do it!
You'll have to kill me!

01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:57.893
Come on, come on!
