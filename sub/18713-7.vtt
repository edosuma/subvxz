00:03.600 --> 00:05.870
Stop him! Stop him! Stop him!

00:11.920 --> 00:13.950
Frankie, no! Don't do this!

00:14.000 --> 00:16.149
Frankie... Frankie, don't!

00:16.200 --> 00:18.070
Oh, no. No!

00:22.480 --> 00:24.800
Welcome to Billingsgate, son.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.230
I thought Liam was your mate?

00:38.280 --> 00:41.950
He is. But that don't
mean he don't deserve it.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.470
Please. Help!

00:46.560 --> 00:48.280
Help me!

00:49.600 --> 00:51.480
Help me, please!

00:52.800 --> 00:55.150
Where did you get the handcuffs, anyhow?

00:55.200 --> 00:57.360
Never you mind.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.600
This geezer's right up my arse.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.670
Ah, Jesus!

01:39.720 --> 01:42.390
- Why'd he do that?
- What you doing?

02:15.080 --> 02:16.840
Thanks.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.750
- Forensics?
- Jack Hodgson.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.630
- DI Tanner.
- Hello.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.390
- You've got red.
- Huh?

02:25.440 --> 02:28.150
That's ketchup. Sorry. What have we got?

02:28.200 --> 02:30.390
Two victims. We found ID.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.390
Same surnames, address.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.230
- We think they're father and son.
- Right.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.710
Dad went through the windscreen.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.750
- Young man in the car
has gunshot wounds. - OK.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.910
How did you get across town so fast?

02:40.960 --> 02:43.870
- One smile and the traffic
parts like the Red Sea. - OK.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.470
Plus I knew traffic would be an
issue, so I had someone pick her up.

02:46.520 --> 02:50.150
- Right. - Any sign he was shot
too? - No, I don't think so.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.070
Let's take a look at the other one.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.560
They picked you up?

02:56.960 --> 03:01.190
I can see two, possibly
three, bullet wounds.

03:01.240 --> 03:04.670
Abdomen, chest and what
may be a bullet graze,

03:04.720 --> 03:06.470
left side of his skull.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.190
Bullet entry points in the
passenger-seat upholstery.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.830
Fired off multiple rounds.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.510
Missed as often as he hit.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.550
Positioning of the
bullet wounds suggest that

03:14.600 --> 03:16.990
he turned to face the
gunman when he was shot.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.910
Which suggests he was conscious.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.630
Looks like he undid his seatbelt
as he was trying to get out.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.630
- Gunman must have been on him quickly.
- Not necessarily.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.910
His legs are pinned.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.190
He could struggle all he liked,
but he wasn't going anywhere.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.910
Massive impact damage
to the front of the car

03:32.960 --> 03:34.430
where it hit the container.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.750
Judging by the dents on the driver's side,

03:36.800 --> 03:40.470
I'd say another car shunted
them, forced the collision.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.240
It appears the gunman's car was black.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.750
The attacker's vehicle braked
hard after the other car crashed.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.830
See this tyre mark? It's wide.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.070
250, 260 mil?

04:12.120 --> 04:15.990
- You won't find tyres that size
on a Fiat 500. - No, you wouldn't.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.470
We're talking SUV, large SUV.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.310
Explains how he was able
to shunt the victim's car.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.710
- Extreme road rage?
- It doesn't feel like road rage.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.320
I think it was planned.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.360
Help. Help my boy!

04:38.640 --> 04:40.950
No!

04:49.320 --> 04:51.870
They're desperate to reopen the road.

04:51.920 --> 04:55.110
Want to know how long till we're done.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.590
- Jack? - Are we sure this
body hasn't been moved?

04:57.640 --> 04:59.670
The car doesn't belong
to either of the deceased.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.030
- It's owned by someone called
Liam Stanwell. - Traced him?

05:02.080 --> 05:04.070
Not yet. Any sign the car was stolen?

05:04.120 --> 05:05.390
The key was in the ignition.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.270
It's registered to an
address in Walthamstow.

05:07.320 --> 05:10.030
- Same area as our victims.
- Maybe they were friends.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.400
- Could he have been in the car with them?
- It's possible.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.310
- Know him?
- Yeah, it's my DCI.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.510
Either he's here to offer
support from the sidelines

05:21.560 --> 05:24.310
or he's going to boot me off the pitch.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.390
- Morning, sir. I wasn't expecting you.
- I'll be taking lead, Jodie.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.950
I don't understand. I thought
you said I could have this?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.510
That was before we had
a name -- Bill McAteer.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.750
I locked his brother, Tommy McAteer,
up for murder a long time ago.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.350
Now Tommy's out, Bill's dead.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.510
I need a full roster of all CCTV
cameras with an eye on this road

05:42.560 --> 05:45.760
- in the last mile.
- Yeah, we're already on it.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.560
His wife been told yet?

06:17.960 --> 06:21.150
Carol, isn't it? Carol McAteer?

06:21.200 --> 06:23.110
Yeah.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.790
DCI Underhill.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.790
Know you, don't I?

06:27.840 --> 06:30.710
You're that lying copper. Haven't
you caused this family enough grief?

06:30.760 --> 06:33.300
Can I come in, please, Mrs McAteer?

06:34.480 --> 06:36.560
It's important.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.400
All right, keep me informed.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.160
Family Liaison officer will be here soon.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.470
Can I get you a tea or coffee?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.950
Just want to see my boy.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.800
We can arrange that... soon.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.470
Why you?

07:10.520 --> 07:14.750
Christ, why did it have to be you?

07:14.800 --> 07:16.940
It's just the way it fell.

07:18.040 --> 07:22.200
Whatever it is you think I
did back then, you're wrong...

07:23.720 --> 07:28.070
.. and I promise you that no-one,
no-one, is going to work harder

07:28.120 --> 07:31.120
to find out who killed
your husband and son.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.000
They were in a friend's car.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.840
Liam Stanwell's car.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.080
- You know Liam?
- Course.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.270
Frankie's best mate.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.420
- What, Liam wasn't with them?
- We don't know.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.820
Did they all usually travel in together?

07:58.960 --> 08:01.160
Liam picks Frankie...

08:02.560 --> 08:05.840
Picked Frankie up every
morning, one o'clock.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.800
Bill drove himself.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.430
Liked to get to the market by midnight.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.390
But Bill didn't drive in yesterday?

08:16.440 --> 08:17.870
I don't know.

08:17.920 --> 08:21.230
Sometimes Liam picked him up if
Bill wanted a drink after work.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.670
But surely you'd know if your
husband left his car at home?

08:23.720 --> 08:26.320
I'm not his bloody keeper!

08:30.080 --> 08:31.470
Should we wait for the DCI?

08:31.520 --> 08:34.390
- Stuff the DCI.
- What's the story with you two?

08:34.440 --> 08:38.110
No. It's fine. It's just
it's my first stab at SIO.

08:38.159 --> 08:41.510
Underhill hears the name McAteer
and he cuts me off at the knees.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.830
Why is he so interested in the McAteers?

08:43.880 --> 08:46.790
He's got history with
Bill's younger brother.

08:46.840 --> 08:50.070
Tommy McAteer tried to rob a dealer in '96

08:50.120 --> 08:53.350
and he ended up taking a
16-year-old kid hostage.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.150
He killed him.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.870
He says it was an accident, but
the jury didn't see it that way.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.510
It was the guvnor's first big win.

08:59.560 --> 09:02.390
- So he thinks it's one brother
killing another? - Mmm.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.910
Apparently there was no love lost.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.520
I forgot to ask...

09:09.720 --> 09:11.350
.. where is Tommy these days?

09:11.400 --> 09:13.190
Tommy had nothing to do with this.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.990
- I'm not saying that he did.
- That's what you think, innit?

09:16.040 --> 09:20.230
He gets out of prison, and what,
kills his own brother? My son?

09:20.280 --> 09:23.670
- I'm not prejudging.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

09:23.720 --> 09:27.070
We didn't even know Tommy had
been released straight off.

09:27.120 --> 09:30.430
Bill found out. Heard he was
in a mess. No job. No money.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.710
Living in filth round
at their dad's old flat.

09:33.760 --> 09:37.510
Bill went round, offered
him a job at the market.

09:37.560 --> 09:41.310
No-one's saying it was
a perfect relationship,

09:41.360 --> 09:44.040
but they were trying to make it work.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.070
He cuffed me.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.910
Who?

09:54.960 --> 09:57.590
Bloody Frankie!

09:57.640 --> 09:59.430
I'm going to kill him when I see him.

09:59.480 --> 10:02.420
I know I'm new here but
he took it too far.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.950
No, Tommy, please...

10:06.000 --> 10:08.350
Tommy, I've been here
for four hours already!

10:08.400 --> 10:11.310
The keys are just on
the side. Tommy, please!

10:11.360 --> 10:13.800
(Tommy, you bastard!)

10:16.760 --> 10:19.070
No, Tommy, mate. Come on, be serious.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.360
No, Tommy, no!

10:42.040 --> 10:45.910
Does the name Liam mean anything to you?

10:45.960 --> 10:48.440
It's Frankie McAteer's phone.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.630
No answer.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.680
Are you sure you don't
know where my car is?

11:01.240 --> 11:03.400
(Jesus.)

11:05.280 --> 11:07.750
- Tommy.
- Who's this?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.030
DCI Underhill. Who are you?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.710
- Liam.
- Liam Stanwell?

11:11.760 --> 11:14.030
- Yeah, how do you know my name?
- I'll come to that in a minute.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.070
Park your arse over there.
I want to talk to you.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.460
No, he's all right where he is.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.040
It's about your brother
and his kid, Frankie.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.400
They're dead.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.430
Extensive bruising around
the eyes and forehead,

11:40.480 --> 11:43.350
probably caused by impact with the airbag.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.030
There's a wound on the
left side of his skull

11:56.080 --> 11:59.640
which, given the nature of his other
injuries, I wouldn't expect to see.

12:01.160 --> 12:04.070
Possibly an old wound
that's been reopened.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.790
Is that significant?

12:05.840 --> 12:09.120
I'll wait to say until I see
the state of the parietal bone.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.670
Now, we both know why I'm here.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.910
20 years inside, no-one kills Bill.

12:19.960 --> 12:23.440
You come out, Bill gets run off the
road, exits the vehicle headfirst.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.470
Where were you between six
and eight this morning?

12:27.520 --> 12:30.350
- I was working.
- Working.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.870
- And what job did Bill give
you? - Deliveries. - Deliveries.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.870
Hardly a seat at the top
table, is it, my son?

12:36.920 --> 12:39.790
Must've been hard, accepting
your brother's charity,

12:39.840 --> 12:43.230
seeing what he'd made of his life.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.880
Fancy house, car, kid...

12:48.800 --> 12:50.640
The wife.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.350
You shut your mouth!

12:55.400 --> 12:57.720
There you are.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.110
That's the Tommy McAteer I know.

13:02.160 --> 13:07.550
The man who stuck a shotgun in
the mouth of a 16-year-old kid

13:07.600 --> 13:10.200
and pulled the trigger.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.030
Christ!

13:23.840 --> 13:26.230
No bullet wounds evident.
The victim wasn't shot.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.030
OK. All right, I'll see
you at Billingsgate, guv.

13:29.080 --> 13:32.430
Liam Stanwell. The DCI found
him and then he lost him.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.280
Call me if you find anything significant.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.630
In addition to extensive bruising
on the left side of his torso,

13:40.680 --> 13:42.230
there's bruising on his face.

13:42.280 --> 13:46.150
- His right ear is... - Does bruising
suggest he didn't die straight away?

13:46.200 --> 13:49.550
- Correct. - Might explain why the
body wasn't where I'd expect it to be

13:49.600 --> 13:52.280
after impact.

14:00.440 --> 14:04.270
Abrasions on the forearms and fingertips

14:04.320 --> 14:06.830
and a grey, gritty substance
embedded in the wounds.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.750
- Probably tarmac.
- He crawled.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.510
And if he crawled, he was still alive...

14:12.560 --> 14:15.590
No!

14:15.640 --> 14:18.280
So why didn't the gunman kill him?

14:41.400 --> 14:43.310
How many times?

14:43.360 --> 14:45.510
During work hours, you
keep your phone turned off.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.430
- I forgot.
- Well, that ain't good enough.

14:47.480 --> 14:51.400
You're walking on thin ice, Becky.
Very thin ice. Do you understand?

14:55.200 --> 14:57.940
He's going to be around here somewhere.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.680
Well, at least we know
he doesn't have a car.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.630
That's the little scrote. Police!

15:08.680 --> 15:11.680
If I had any cartilage
left in me knees... Ah!

15:31.680 --> 15:34.600
- Why the hell do you run?
- I don't know.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.870
Why was Frankie driving your car, Liam?

15:40.920 --> 15:43.470
- He took it.
- Stole it?

15:43.520 --> 15:45.870
Well, yeah, I suppose, but
it was a joke, you know.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.350
He was trying to make
things even worse for me.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.350
Is that usually part of the initiation?

15:50.400 --> 15:54.630
How would I know? And what's
that got to do with anything?

15:54.680 --> 15:56.750
My best mate has been murdered, right,

15:56.800 --> 15:59.910
and you're asking questions about my car?

15:59.960 --> 16:03.720
Do you think the fact that Frankie was
driving your car is significant, Liam?

16:07.840 --> 16:10.440
Was somebody trying to hurt Frankie?

16:11.960 --> 16:14.950
Is that why you ran?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.400
Are you worried somebody
might want to hurt you too?

16:19.040 --> 16:22.120
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.200
Can I go?

16:37.240 --> 16:40.150
- He's lying, guv.
- Maybe.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.630
Or maybe he's just a kid who's
just lost his best mate.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.880
No need to complicate it
any more than it already is.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.110
Yeah, we did. Wasn't much help.
I'll tell you about it later.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.550
Yeah, he's here.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.590
- Hello.
- Hello.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.590
- Got a favour to ask.
- You can ask.

16:57.640 --> 17:00.230
- I need Frankie McAteer's phone analysed.
- We're ahead of you.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.310
Clarissa's already working on it.

17:02.360 --> 17:06.109
Bill McAteer died from a subdural
haematoma sustained in the crash.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.430
He survived for several
minutes afterwards,

17:08.480 --> 17:11.550
but the gunman didn't finish him off.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.710
So Frankie must've been the target?

17:13.760 --> 17:16.390
We thought the phone would suggest why.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.390
It's virtually empty.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.750
Bits and bobs, some photos, messages,

17:20.800 --> 17:22.470
but they're all from the last few days.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.910
- That's strange. Is it a new phone?
- Well-used.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.190
So why would he have deleted the rest?

17:27.240 --> 17:30.480
Is there any way we can access
that deleted information?

17:32.400 --> 17:36.110
We can't, but we know a man who can.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.670
Thank you, sir, thank you.

17:38.720 --> 17:42.520
- Are we going to see the boss?
- Through there. - Thanks.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.550
Thomas, how the hell are you?

17:47.880 --> 17:50.230
I, er, I knew you'd need me one day.

17:50.280 --> 17:53.270
Let's get one thing clear, Max.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.590
You're absolutely not saving the day.

17:55.640 --> 17:59.790
- That's not what's happening here,
is it, Jack? - No, absolutely not.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.070
Oh, that is a thing of beauty.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.750
- Hey.
- Hi, Nikki. It's been ages.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.310
I hear you're doing
great things at Linzetto.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.110
You should come see us.
I'll give you a tour.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.550
- I'd love that. - Max, no-one
told me we were expecting you.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.190
That explains the lack of red carpet.

18:15.240 --> 18:18.270
Max is letting us borrow one
of his Cellebrite machines.

18:18.320 --> 18:21.070
We need to recover some deleted data.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.270
We don't have the technology to do that?

18:23.320 --> 18:26.600
Last time I was here, you were
boiling water on open fires.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.950
Digital forensics is a
dynamic, fast-moving field.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.790
It's very much for specialists these days.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.990
Right, well, you'll let us
know how much we owe you

18:36.040 --> 18:38.750
- for the hire of the machine.
- Oh, no, it's fine. No money needed.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.800
No, really. We'll pay.
Good to see you, Max.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.870
Red carpet? Boiling water on open fires?

18:46.920 --> 18:48.950
- Why bait him like that?
- I wasn't baiting him.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.630
- I was just trying to make a feeble joke.
- Oh, it was a feeble joke.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.780
- He did look cross, didn't he?
- He did a bit.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.710
- So, Jack, you know how to use
a Cellebrite machine? - Negative.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.430
- Read about them. - Well, data
analysis software can be a bit tricksy.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.280
- So, you need me to take you through it?
- Nah, he's got me.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.270
OK, but God forbid you have to ring
me up because you're struggling.

19:10.320 --> 19:14.160
- Yeah, I think I'll manage.
- OK.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.880
- See you. Nikki, Jack.
- Cheers.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.350
- Right.
- Right.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.000
- So... - Let's get to. - Good luck.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.600
Show me. I am putty in your hands.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.790
One bullet passed straight
through Frankie's right ventricle,

19:48.840 --> 19:50.510
severing the pulmonary artery.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.670
He would have lost consciousness
after a few seconds,

19:52.720 --> 19:53.790
bled to death quickly.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.590
Bullets from the car are mush,
so please tell me you found it.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.070
Well that one passed straight
through, but another entered

19:59.120 --> 20:01.550
through the stomach fundus,
glanced off the spine.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.390
I extracted it and here it
is relatively unscathed.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.110
I'd say 9mm, wouldn't you?

20:07.160 --> 20:10.870
- Beretta? Glock? - In London right
now, I'd put my money on a Baikal.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.710
Converted gas pistol, made in
Russia, converted in Lithuania,

20:13.760 --> 20:15.910
smuggled to the UK by the crate-load.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.470
You can pick one up for just over
a grand if you know where to look.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.510
- They call it, "hit man kit".
- So you think this was a professional job?

20:21.560 --> 20:24.990
If it was, he was having a bad day.
Trapped target, close proximity.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.510
You saw how may rounds were
fired off into that car.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.030
He missed more often than he hit, in
reasonable light, from three feet.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.870
- Maybe it was new to him.
- Or maybe the guvnor's right.

20:35.920 --> 20:40.200
Gunman's fresh out of the nick, hasn't
fired a gun in a very long time.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.790
- Come.
- You wanted to see me?

21:07.840 --> 21:10.310
Jack, just between you and me,

21:10.360 --> 21:14.150
next time you need outside help
on a case, run it by me first.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.670
He's Clarissa's husband.
He was helping out.

21:16.720 --> 21:21.630
Yeah, he's also a competitor,
so just clear it with me first.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.710
OK?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.920
OK.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.160
Take a look.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.150
What exactly am I looking at?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.230
- Remember the historic
head wound? - Yeah.

21:41.280 --> 21:43.670
This is a section of
Frankie's parietal bone.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.830
During postmortem, I found
the skull was fractured.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.710
And this is significant how?

21:48.760 --> 21:51.430
It wasn't anything to do
with the car accident.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.390
It's a healing fracture.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.310
So even though this is a
relatively weak area of the skull,

21:56.360 --> 21:59.030
it would have taken
considerable force to cause this.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.230
So we're not talking an average
bump on the head, then?

22:01.280 --> 22:03.990
Typically, I find this kind of
blunt force injury in someone who's

22:04.040 --> 22:07.990
been hit with a hard implement,
say, a heavy piece of wood or metal.

22:08.040 --> 22:11.350
- OK, so this could be evidence of a
prior assault? - A - major - assault.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.270
What timescale are we looking at?

22:13.320 --> 22:17.070
Difficult to be exact, but given
his age, I'd estimate the injury

22:17.120 --> 22:20.640
was sustained within the
last three-ish weeks.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.870
He was a young man. Young men fight.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.430
They get drunk and fall over.

22:26.480 --> 22:28.150
That's not evidence he was the target.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.990
OK, but if this is about the two brothers,

22:30.040 --> 22:32.390
why didn't Tommy put a
bullet in Bill to make sure?

22:32.440 --> 22:34.070
And why kill Frankie at all?

22:34.120 --> 22:36.230
To cover his arse or maybe
get a clear run at Mum.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.230
- Guv, what are you talking
about? - Look... - Tanner.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.070
.. I'm not saying Frankie
wasn't the target.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.710
What I'm saying is, seeing how
the family black sheep has just

22:42.760 --> 22:45.870
returned to the fold in the shape
of a violent, gun-toting maniac,

22:45.920 --> 22:49.510
then maybe, just maybe, Tommy
McAteer's worth keeping an eye on.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.750
They've got footage of
the vehicle involved.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.070
Can they patch it through here?

22:53.120 --> 22:56.430
Yeah, can you patch it
through to The Lyell?

22:56.480 --> 22:58.470
That's the McAteer car.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.590
Do we know how far this
is from the crash scene?

23:00.640 --> 23:03.750
- Three or four miles, give or take.
- He was waiting for them, 6am.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.190
- We can't even see the driver.
- On the plus side, we've got the plates.

23:07.240 --> 23:11.030
That SUV was stolen from the Stoke
Newington area three nights ago.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.880
Good.

23:15.120 --> 23:16.550
Can you rewind that?

23:16.600 --> 23:18.870
This was planned. He was waiting.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.750
He knew their route. He knew them.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.910
Throw in the firearms
and the stolen vehicle,

23:22.960 --> 23:26.150
that, Jodie, is the sea
Tommy McAteer swims in.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.510
There. Hand out, hand in.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.280
Yeah.

23:31.600 --> 23:34.790
The driver dropped a cigarette
butt out the window.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.180
We need to find that right now.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.390
How do you know that's the one?

24:07.440 --> 24:10.390
Rained yesterday. Didn't rain on this.

24:10.440 --> 24:13.230
- Do you think you can get DNA?
- Maybe.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.990
Cross-check Tommy McAteer's
DNA on the national database.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.080
Underhill.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.270
Right.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.360
They've found the car.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.710
Look, I don't want to hurt you, right?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.190
Frankie's dead.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.230
He was murdered this morning
and he's asked to meet.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.590
Please! Please, talk to him for me!

24:35.640 --> 24:38.630
Please, I am begging you! please!

24:51.320 --> 24:53.430
Excellent chat, guys. Come
on, we've got work to do.

24:53.480 --> 24:56.870
He grabbed me and pushed
me against a wall.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.990
He said Frankie was dead.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.950
Was it you?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.940
Look, I NEED to know.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.720
Was it you?

25:13.360 --> 25:16.150
- Anything?
- It's been wiped clean.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.710
Might get a few hairs or fibres
if we're lucky but chances are

25:18.760 --> 25:19.990
this car won't tell us much.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.750
You reckon?

25:21.800 --> 25:23.870
You know, you do a job.
You dump the motor.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.470
If you're clever, you leave it
a fair distance from your gaff.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.590
But most criminals ain't clever.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.380
They like a nice easy walk back to bed.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.750
It's less than half a mile from
here to the Millhouse estate.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.390
Let me guess. This Tommy McAteer
lives at the Millhouse estate?

25:39.440 --> 25:40.870
He most certainly does.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.990
Why are you so sure this is Cain and Abel?

25:44.040 --> 25:48.400
Cain, Abel with a little Romeo and
Juliet thrown in for good measure.

25:50.320 --> 25:53.670
Carol was Tommy's girl
before she was Bill's.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.590
I nicked him in '96.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.350
She sat in that courtroom
every day of his trial.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.560
But Tommy went down. Long way down.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.670
So Tommy wants his girl back?

26:08.720 --> 26:12.190
Kills two members of
his family to get her?

26:12.240 --> 26:16.200
It's not just her. It's the
business, the house, the works.

26:17.800 --> 26:21.470
The McAteers are one of the
oldest firms in Billingsgate.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.510
Bill made it the most successful.

26:24.560 --> 26:27.390
Tommy wants what his brother had.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.440
All of it.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.150
Mrs McAteer?

26:34.200 --> 26:36.830
Would you like to come with me?

26:36.880 --> 26:39.040
Would you like me to come?

27:04.080 --> 27:06.240
Mrs McAteer.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.550
I need to go home. I don't
feel too good. Is that OK?

27:46.600 --> 27:49.110
We're busy. If Paul was here, maybe.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.430
I really don't feel too good, Jason.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.070
What's going on with you?

27:53.120 --> 27:56.960
Weeks of this, calling in sick,
walking out early. I've had enough.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.350
That's right. Walk away.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.150
Piss off, Jason.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.840
Walk away and don't come back.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.390
Thomas really surprised me
earlier, the way he reacted to Max.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.950
- No, it's understandable.
- Being rude?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.750
Being overprotective.

28:16.800 --> 28:19.110
Max is always looking for new staff.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.510
So he's worried about
poaching? That's ridiculous.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.870
Is it?

28:22.920 --> 28:25.390
Just had the guvnor on the phone.
He wants the DNA fast-tracked,

28:25.440 --> 28:26.710
hoping it's McAteer.

28:26.760 --> 28:30.550
I think he might actually
spontaneously combust if it isn't.

28:30.600 --> 28:34.550
I extracted the deleted data
from Frankie McAteer's phone.

28:34.600 --> 28:38.550
Now, the analyser software
allows you to filter the data,

28:38.600 --> 28:42.150
so I've managed to isolate
the messages between Frankie

28:42.200 --> 28:43.670
and Liam Stanwell.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.590
There's loads of it.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.070
Dipped my toe in.

28:47.120 --> 28:51.150
Makes The LAD Bible look
like The Great Gatsby.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.750
I may have to pluck out my
eyeballs if I read much more.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.540
- Can you filter by date?
- Of course.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.270
Three weeks ago, Liam
thinks he's being followed

29:00.320 --> 29:02.550
and two days later, Frankie's panicking,

29:02.600 --> 29:04.630
suggests they go to the
police because he thinks

29:04.680 --> 29:06.590
he's going to get, "whacked".

29:06.640 --> 29:10.670
Liam talks him down, but they seem
genuinely scared for their lives.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.430
If they were so spooked, why
not just go to the police?

29:13.480 --> 29:15.310
Yeah, now, Frankie mentions that.

29:15.360 --> 29:18.190
- Yeah, here. Liam responds.
- "Delete the video."

29:18.240 --> 29:21.430
Why would a video stop
them going to the police?

29:21.480 --> 29:24.110
Well, it depends what's on the video and,

29:24.160 --> 29:26.790
after spending several hours
wading through their messages,

29:26.840 --> 29:29.430
I very much doubt it was an
episode of Antiques Roadshow.

29:29.480 --> 29:33.200
- We kind of need to find that footage.
- Mrs McAteer says she'll speak to us.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.350
Head injury? Frankie
didn't have a head injury.

29:38.400 --> 29:42.230
I'm afraid he did and it
was really quite serious.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.910
I've rung all the hospitals in the area.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.430
Can't find any evidence
of Frankie being admitted.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.990
Why would he? There was no injury.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.750
We've accessed messages
on his mobile phone.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.550
In text exchanges with Liam Stanwell,

29:56.600 --> 29:58.430
he refers to being attacked.

29:58.480 --> 30:03.190
- Attacked by who? - He doesn't
say. But both boys seemed scared.

30:03.240 --> 30:08.640
Uh... They refer to a video
in relation to the assault.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.310
Did Frankie make videos?

30:12.360 --> 30:15.160
All young people make videos, don't they?

30:17.040 --> 30:19.080
He was scared, you say?

30:21.320 --> 30:22.920
He didn't say.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.070
Mrs McAteer, can you think of any reason

30:29.120 --> 30:32.350
why he wouldn't have told you
about something like that?

30:32.400 --> 30:33.800
No.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.800
We were close.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.720
I thought he told me everything.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.990
He would almost certainly
have been concussed.

30:46.040 --> 30:49.230
May have had a bad headache,
suffered nausea, dizziness.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.350
Does that ring any bells?

30:53.640 --> 30:58.080
He was laid up in bed a few
days last month. Said he had flu.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.630
Didn't say anything about a head injury.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.550
He would've told me.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.420
Unless he had a good reason not to.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.670
Mrs McAteer, was there anybody else

31:16.720 --> 31:19.310
he could have confided in at the time?

31:19.360 --> 31:21.360
A girlfriend, perhaps?

31:32.400 --> 31:34.000
It's this one.

31:49.720 --> 31:54.030
This is... my dad. Just visiting.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.720
- DI Tanner. - Nikki Alexander,
Home Office pathologist. - Hey.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.390
Pathologist?

32:00.440 --> 32:02.550
Nikki's here because
she has expert knowledge

32:02.600 --> 32:06.030
- relating to an investigation...
- What investigation?

32:06.080 --> 32:09.270
Mr Teller, we'd like to talk to your
daughter in private, if that's OK.

32:09.320 --> 32:12.440
- Is she in trouble? - Absolutely not.
We're just trying to locate someone.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.590
It's fine, Dad.

32:18.400 --> 32:19.760
Go.

32:31.320 --> 32:34.060
- What time does Paul get back?
- Soon.

32:34.680 --> 32:38.440
- I'll be fine.
- All right. Call me if he doesn't show.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.150
Becky, could we sit down?

32:48.600 --> 32:51.000
- Is Paul your boyfriend?
- No.

32:51.840 --> 32:54.230
We live together, but not like that.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.670
Actually, we wanted to talk
to you about an old boyfriend.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.920
Frankie McAteer?

33:02.280 --> 33:04.310
Paul! You're back. How was the course?

33:04.360 --> 33:05.350
Yeah, I was star student.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.750
Got a certificate and everything.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.230
Right. Get your coat off.
We're short-handed here.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.350
Why? Where's Becky?

33:11.400 --> 33:14.920
- How long were you together?
- Er, three or four months?

33:16.360 --> 33:20.360
- And when was the last time you saw him?
- Er, I don't know.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.100
A few weeks ago.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.270
Are you OK?

33:32.280 --> 33:36.030
Becky, I'm here because I
found evidence that Frankie

33:36.080 --> 33:40.040
had sustained damage to his skull
around the last time you saw him.

33:41.360 --> 33:44.790
It could've been accidental,
like falling heavily,

33:44.840 --> 33:47.040
hitting his head on a kerb.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.300
Did something like that happen?

33:51.320 --> 33:53.590
Did Frankie mention anything?

33:55.160 --> 33:56.360
Um.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.150
The other possibility
is that he was attacked.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.750
And obviously, now that he's
dead, well, that's significant.

34:06.800 --> 34:10.510
And we have reason to believe
that Frankie felt threatened.

34:10.560 --> 34:14.870
- Did he ever speak to
you about that? - Um. No.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.870
And what about Liam?
Did Liam say anything?

34:17.920 --> 34:19.510
Well, I presume you knew Liam.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.230
By all accounts they were inseparable.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.719
Yeah, I, I... I knew him.

34:30.120 --> 34:35.230
Sorry. It is just the way things
ended with me and Frankie...

34:35.280 --> 34:36.510
it was bad.

34:36.560 --> 34:40.389
I've spent the last month trying to
put him out of my mind, that's all.

34:40.440 --> 34:44.630
Look, I wish I could help, but
I just don't know anything.

34:45.580 --> 34:46.850
Becks?

34:48.800 --> 34:50.150
Hi.

34:50.199 --> 34:53.550
- This is Paul.
- Thanks for your time.

34:53.600 --> 34:57.040
Here's my number if you think
of anything that might help us.

35:06.320 --> 35:10.360
- Who was that?
- The police. Frankie's dead.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.840
Someone killed him and
his dad this morning.

35:16.720 --> 35:17.950
She's holding something back.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.510
Her reaction to Liam. What was that about?

35:21.560 --> 35:24.960
Maybe I should try and find
Mr Stanwell and ask him.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.350
Do you think he might have done it?

35:31.400 --> 35:32.750
He swears he didn't,

35:32.800 --> 35:36.280
but now Frankie's dead
and Liam's terrified.

35:38.120 --> 35:41.920
I-I think he's done what he
said he was going to do, Paul.

35:42.320 --> 35:44.860
And now it's all going to come out.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.390
Everything.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.910
Made some pasta, if you want some?

36:34.200 --> 36:36.790
- Hello?
- 'It's Liam. Frankie's mate.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.030
'Look, I realise we don't
know each other that well,

36:39.080 --> 36:42.480
'but I need to speak to
Becky and she's blocked me.'

36:42.640 --> 36:44.580
'It's about her dad.'

37:04.640 --> 37:06.710
- Hello.
- We're closing.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.430
My daughter says you fired her.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.950
Sorry, I can't keep carrying her

37:10.000 --> 37:11.750
when she feels a bit under the weather.

37:11.800 --> 37:14.630
You're going to call her. You're
going to tell her you made a mistake

37:14.680 --> 37:18.280
- and you're going to apologise.
- And what if I don't?

37:23.840 --> 37:27.140
Made you some supper. Want
me to leave it outside?

37:32.680 --> 37:34.200
Becky?

37:44.080 --> 37:46.360
Becky, open the door.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.920
Becky.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.560
Oh, Jesus. Becky. Becky.
Becky. Wake up. Wake up.

37:58.040 --> 38:01.230
Becky, please, come on, wake
up. Becky, what have you done?

38:01.280 --> 38:03.470
Wake up. Come on.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.790
To establish paternity, you'd
generally test 15 markers...

38:07.840 --> 38:10.070
You've established paternity
from a cigarette butt?

38:10.120 --> 38:12.270
No, that hasn't been
processed yet. Bear with me.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.310
In order to be considered the father,

38:14.360 --> 38:16.670
all 15 markers have to match.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.190
This is Frankie McAteer's profile.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.830
So Frankie's DNA is a match for
Bill's. What's the revelation?

38:27.880 --> 38:30.840
This isn't Bill's profile. It's Tommy's.

38:35.720 --> 38:36.950
No.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.350
I thought about what you were saying
earlier. About Carol and Tommy.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.590
How she was his girl
before he went to prison.

38:42.640 --> 38:45.430
He was here with Carol, when
she came to identify the bodies

38:45.480 --> 38:47.920
- and he was upset.
- Bollocks.

38:49.360 --> 38:52.270
Tommy and Bill were brothers, surely
that makes their DNA profiles...

38:52.320 --> 38:56.670
Identical twins aside, brothers
still have unique profiles.

38:56.720 --> 39:00.020
There's no doubt about it.
Frankie was Tommy's boy.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.750
Did he know?

39:07.800 --> 39:11.320
Judging by what I saw today,
I'd say it was likely.

39:12.680 --> 39:16.120
I don't think he killed his
nephew. I think he lost his son.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.350
God, it's depressing.

39:24.400 --> 39:28.030
I mean, how many clips of drunk young men

39:28.080 --> 39:31.390
chanting and baring their
arses does one person need?

39:31.440 --> 39:33.550
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.510
This is chicken.

39:35.560 --> 39:36.990
I asked for duck.

39:37.040 --> 39:40.110
That may be chicken...

39:40.160 --> 39:43.190
but I have it on
particularly good authority

39:43.240 --> 39:47.880
that this, this particular chicken
was raised as a, as a duck.

39:53.400 --> 39:56.670
- It's nice this.
- The food?

39:56.720 --> 39:58.470
No.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.520
Working together again.

40:01.800 --> 40:06.590
I need to find a way to filter
through, find the relevant footage.

40:06.640 --> 40:10.560
- Well, it doesn't... - Hey, Jack.
- Oh sorry. - And the connection to them.

40:12.280 --> 40:15.790
No, what I'm saying is, it doesn't
matter whether the stuff's jumbled.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.870
If we selected photos of each of the boys,

40:18.920 --> 40:23.550
then we'd be able to programme the
analyser to use facial recognition,

40:23.600 --> 40:25.510
and then we could search for material

40:25.560 --> 40:27.760
in which only they appear...

40:32.230 --> 40:33.230
Jack.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.870
Just so you know, Max was
dropping off food for Clarissa.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.910
I didn't ask him to stay, so...

40:37.960 --> 40:39.590
Ah, no, don't worry. It's fine.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.840
And, erm, yeah, maybe I
overreacted a bit, earlier.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.710
About Max, I want you to know,

40:46.760 --> 40:49.870
you've absolutely nothing to worry
about as far as I'm concerned.

40:49.920 --> 40:51.150
Right.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.510
Clarissa says he's been
recruiting for other labs.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.790
So I thought maybe that's why
you didn't want him around.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.550
It does concern me, yeah.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.750
Which is why I'm saying
you don't need to worry...

41:00.800 --> 41:02.540
about me leaving.

41:02.920 --> 41:07.030
Oh, right, no, no, erm,
that's good of you, Jack,

41:07.080 --> 41:11.150
and believe me I, I do not
want to see you go but, um,

41:11.200 --> 41:13.870
actually I was rather more concerned
he was trying to poach Clarissa.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.520
You think he's trying to recruit her?

41:17.760 --> 41:21.680
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
Ignore me. I'm being paranoid.

41:23.320 --> 41:26.800
- OK. I should probably...
- Yeah. - Yeah.

41:35.720 --> 41:40.880
'What a night. Oh, man, I'm wasted.'

41:42.840 --> 41:44.440
There's Liam.

41:48.240 --> 41:53.480
'And this is my main man, Frankie.
Oi, Frankie mate, say hello.'

41:54.840 --> 41:56.710
'What you doing, mate?'

41:56.760 --> 42:00.590
'And this, this is Becky.'

42:00.640 --> 42:02.800
When was this clip shot?

42:04.480 --> 42:06.220
Three weeks ago.

42:08.040 --> 42:10.670
'Mate, your girlfriend is so fit!'

42:10.720 --> 42:13.080
'I know, mate.'

42:14.080 --> 42:15.640
Oh, Christ.

42:18.480 --> 42:21.020
- You don't - have - to watch this.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.040
If you do... I do.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.120
I'm glad you're here, Max.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.180
Oi!

42:54.200 --> 42:55.270
What you doing?

42:55.320 --> 42:57.110
Ain't what it looks like.

42:57.160 --> 42:59.910
It's, it's my locker, Tom. I
just don't know where my key is.

42:59.960 --> 43:04.390
I'm not doubting you, son. I'm just
asking what it is you need so bad.

43:04.440 --> 43:07.940
Clothes. I keep a set of
clothes in here, that's all.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.750
You got plenty of clothes at home, no?

43:11.800 --> 43:13.870
Yeah, I'm not going home.

43:15.360 --> 43:19.200
Er, my mum drinks, you see. I,
I can't go home. Not tonight.

43:24.320 --> 43:26.790
And where will you sleep tonight?

43:30.440 --> 43:34.430
'And this is my main man, Frankie.'

43:34.480 --> 43:37.510
'Hey, oi, Frankie mate, say hello.'

43:37.560 --> 43:39.390
'What you doing, mate?'

43:39.440 --> 43:42.960
'Oh, and this, this is Becky.'

43:44.920 --> 43:46.800
'Beautiful Becky.'

43:50.480 --> 43:54.600
- 'Your girlfriend is so fit!'
- 'I know, mate.'

44:09.920 --> 44:11.320
Stop it.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.910
We, er, think this has to be the video

44:20.960 --> 44:22.670
they're referring to in their messages.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.430
I'm not surprised they were
worried. That was rape.

44:25.480 --> 44:29.150
- One of the boys was her
boyfriend, right? - Irrelevant.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.400
Did you hear consent given?

44:32.480 --> 44:34.030
Clarissa, where did you find this?

44:34.080 --> 44:38.350
In, er, Frankie's mobile
cache. He'd deleted it.

44:38.400 --> 44:39.590
It gets worse, I'm afraid.

44:39.640 --> 44:42.990
We, we checked his erased browser history.

44:43.040 --> 44:45.430
There's a link to a website
hosting revenge porn.

44:45.480 --> 44:46.870
He uploaded it?

44:46.920 --> 44:49.720
Someone did. A couple of days afterwards.

44:50.320 --> 44:52.920
It's still there on the website now.

45:13.200 --> 45:15.390
- Told me you'd keep an eye on her.
- I'm sorry.

45:15.440 --> 45:16.750
"I'll look after her," you said.

45:16.800 --> 45:19.790
- I tried! - No, you
didn't. We had an agreement.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.110
Someone had to stay with her.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.150
You said you'd call if
you ever had to go away.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.510
It was just one night.
It was a training course.

45:26.560 --> 45:29.590
She tell you she got jumped, one
of the boys outside her work?

45:29.640 --> 45:32.840
Shitting himself cos one
of his mates got killed.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.100
Deserved it.

45:37.280 --> 45:39.480
She's my little girl, Paul.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.670
She's all I've got.

45:43.840 --> 45:46.040
It's my job to protect her.

46:05.280 --> 46:06.520
Paul.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.550
Paul. Paul. Please, can we talk?

46:10.600 --> 46:14.700
Look, whatever she told you,
mate, it ain't true. It can't be.

46:15.360 --> 46:17.160
What was it, then?

46:18.040 --> 46:21.270
It was just sex. You know,
we were drunk, we were stoned.

46:21.320 --> 46:24.350
It just happened. These
things happen, right?

46:24.400 --> 46:28.240
- You put it on the internet.
- Yeah, that was a mistake.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.710
I was just trying to piss off Frankie.

46:32.760 --> 46:34.990
He was actin' like such a
prick after she dumped him.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.380
Making out it was all my fault.

46:37.680 --> 46:40.550
Look, I know what I did was wrong, I do...

46:42.440 --> 46:45.040
.. but I don't deserve to die for it.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.200
Someone's been following me.

46:51.360 --> 46:53.960
Past few days, I've had this feeling.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.430
Are you sure you're not
just being paranoid?

47:00.480 --> 47:02.020
Yeah, maybe.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.760
But after what her dad did
to Frankie a few weeks back?

47:08.480 --> 47:11.020
And now he's gone and murdered him.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.990
Frankie was in my car.
I should be dead too.

47:14.040 --> 47:17.350
And now I can't think
straight, I can't breath.

47:17.400 --> 47:20.910
I keep on thinking he's hiding
round every corner. Please!

47:20.960 --> 47:23.300
Just, just talk to him for me.

47:25.160 --> 47:27.630
Give me your phone number.

47:27.680 --> 47:29.790
I'm not using my phone
no more. He can track it.

47:29.840 --> 47:32.380
Then how am I going to contact you?

47:33.760 --> 47:36.100
I'm staying at a mate's place.

47:37.560 --> 47:39.280
It's close.

47:43.080 --> 47:45.150
Please. Just talk to him.

48:03.240 --> 48:07.270
Three e-mails from Frankie to
the porn site administrator.

48:07.320 --> 48:11.750
He was begging for the videos to be
taken down. He never got an answer.

48:11.800 --> 48:15.830
So Liam posts a revenge porn video online.

48:15.880 --> 48:17.510
Frankie tries to get it taken down.

48:17.560 --> 48:21.060
And it was about this time
that Frankie was attacked.

48:21.720 --> 48:23.710
Maybe he had good reason
to want it taken down.

48:23.760 --> 48:26.030
The video's been copied dozens of times.

48:26.080 --> 48:29.710
It's hosted on countless other
websites all over the world.

48:29.760 --> 48:33.600
I, er, very much doubt
she consented to that.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.990
If this video did lead to the
murder of Bill and Frankie McAteer,

48:45.040 --> 48:47.230
we have to assume Liam
Stanwell's also in danger.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.830
Yeah, I've been trying to contact him

48:48.880 --> 48:51.630
ever since we left Becky Teller's.
He's not answering his phone.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.310
So we keep on trying,

48:53.360 --> 48:55.750
and we focus on the people who
had an interest in doing him harm.

48:55.800 --> 48:59.200
As far as I can see, that's
the girl and her family.

48:59.520 --> 49:03.750
- What do we know about Dad?
- Stuart Teller. He's ex-army.

49:03.800 --> 49:07.750
Lance Corporal, Blues and Royals.
Did two tours of Afghanistan.

49:07.800 --> 49:12.480
'And was discharged in 2011. For
substance abuse and assault.'

49:40.680 --> 49:42.310
Paul? DI Tanner.

49:42.360 --> 49:44.870
I called round earlier with my
colleague, to speak to Becky.

49:44.920 --> 49:46.460
Is she here?

49:55.680 --> 49:56.830
Straight back to work.

49:56.880 --> 49:59.820
Yeah, well, someone's
got to pay the bills.

50:01.680 --> 50:04.910
Still good with a knife,
I'll give you that.

50:04.960 --> 50:07.960
- Your old man teach you?
- What do you want?

50:09.440 --> 50:11.640
I've come to say I'm sorry.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.950
- About Frankie.
- Yep.

50:15.720 --> 50:17.060
No, Tom.

50:18.480 --> 50:20.280
I really am sorry.

50:29.880 --> 50:32.480
When did Carol tell you he was yours?

50:38.560 --> 50:40.830
Five years back, on his 18th.

50:43.280 --> 50:44.950
Bill ever know?

50:52.800 --> 50:54.430
We think Frankie may have been killed

50:54.480 --> 50:57.150
because of something him and Liam did.

50:58.320 --> 51:01.710
Something to do with a
girlfriend of Frankie's.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.700
We need to find Liam.

52:25.240 --> 52:28.110
Excuse me. We need to
speak to Becky Teller.

52:28.160 --> 52:29.950
She was admitted earlier today.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.510
I'm afraid that's impossible.
She's been sedated.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.470
Er, what about her father? Is he here?

52:34.520 --> 52:37.190
- No, he left about an hour ago. - OK.

52:52.920 --> 52:55.990
Well, the nurse says that Stuart
Teller left the hospital an hour ago.

52:56.040 --> 52:58.230
Called it in and found they're
already looking for him.

52:58.280 --> 53:01.380
He assaulted Becky's boss
earlier this evening.

53:02.200 --> 53:04.590
If he's after Liam Stanwell,
we need to find him.

53:04.640 --> 53:09.800
Don't worry. I know where
Liam is. Yeah, I'm on my way.

54:20.120 --> 54:22.480
Tommy? Is it you?

54:42.280 --> 54:46.080
Liam! Liam, it's Paul.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.990
Are you following me? What do you want?

55:38.040 --> 55:40.310
The attacker grabbed the back of his neck.

55:40.360 --> 55:42.190
Pushing the knife in with his left.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.630
Where are you going?

55:43.680 --> 55:45.630
If it was me, I'd want
to do something about it.

55:45.680 --> 55:49.350
And if I'd known about that, you
bet your life I would have done.

55:49.400 --> 55:53.470
You want to be a father to that
boy, you find out who did this!

55:53.520 --> 55:56.430
You find them and you tear
them to pieces, do you hear me?

55:56.480 --> 55:57.920
You find them!

55:58.305 --> 56:04.921
