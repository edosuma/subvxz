00:55.920 --> 00:56.955
<i>A new job?</i>

00:57.240 --> 00:58.275
It's in Buffalo.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.549
Buffalo?

01:01.520 --> 01:02.839
<i>There must be something
you're not telling me.</i>

01:02.920 --> 01:04.239
<i>Why are you leaving?</i>

01:04.760 --> 01:07.320
It's been clear to me
how much you want a family.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.829
<i>But, my abortion...</i>

01:11.560 --> 01:12.675
<i>It left me sterile.</i>

01:14.680 --> 01:16.079
William, please accept this.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.957
I... I don't know what to say.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.593
<i>No...</i>

01:29.680 --> 01:30.874
<i>Julia?</i>

01:55.080 --> 01:57.036
- Sir?
- What is it, Constable?

01:57.120 --> 01:58.758
Sir, a body has been found,

01:58.840 --> 02:00.273
in a manner of speaking.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.032
Get a move on, Murdoch.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.314
This one's nasty.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.034
Alert Dr Francis.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.628
- Oh, but, sir...
- Just do it. Please.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.399
Bloody hell.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.632
Constable Higgins, what have you?

02:23.720 --> 02:26.234
Well, the McMurphy sisters
are bird watchers, sir.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.232
Apparently, they were on the trail
of the rufous-sided towhee.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.034
Apparently the male has a black head
and upper parts, while the female...

02:32.120 --> 02:33.951
Oh, Higgins, just the facts, man.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.554
Right. Sorry, sir.

02:35.640 --> 02:36.993
After they discovered the remains,

02:37.080 --> 02:38.911
Gladys McMurphy ran to a
neighbour's house up the way, sir.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.318
The neighbour is the one
who telephone called us, sir.

02:41.800 --> 02:42.869
I see. And where is he?

02:43.320 --> 02:44.992
He had some appointments to attend to

02:45.080 --> 02:47.435
but he's eager to come to the station
later to give a statement.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.711
Very good. Right, then.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.514
We'll need to drag the river from
this point, all the way to the lake.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.669
That's a considerable distance, sir.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.275
Is there a problem, Constable?

02:57.440 --> 02:58.919
Just get it set up, Higgins.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.029
Right away, sir.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.711
This had better be
the crime scene of the century.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.431
Sir, you said this was
a particularly nasty one.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.238
I thought he might at least
make an appearance.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.432
So, has Queen Victoria shot her lover?
Has your mayor been...

03:15.040 --> 03:16.996
Disembowelled by dragons, or what?

03:17.200 --> 03:18.235
Dr Francis,

03:18.680 --> 03:19.749
nice of you to come by.

03:20.120 --> 03:23.351
You know I see little use at all,
Detective Murdoch,

03:23.560 --> 03:26.996
in attending a crime scene. All of
the real work is done at my morgue.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.038
Doctor, if you please.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.469
Oh, well.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.199
Ooh!
This is a gruesome affair, isn't it?

03:37.960 --> 03:41.032
You know,
it's just a wild guess, Detective,

03:41.120 --> 03:45.830
but it is possible that the victim was
chopped up and encased in concrete.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.029
And no other insights,
aside from the obvious?

03:50.120 --> 03:53.396
When the remains are brought
to my morgue, I will make a full report.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.558
You know, I am sure your Dr Ogden

03:57.000 --> 03:59.912
happily traipsed to whatever crime scene
you wished.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.709
But I, sir,

04:02.520 --> 04:03.555
am not she.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.633
Have I been wasting my breath
these last six months, Murdoch?

04:11.120 --> 04:12.917
Francis does things his way.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.429
Accept it. Things have changed.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.872
Rather busy at the moment.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.673
Yes, I'm sure you are, Doctor.

04:39.760 --> 04:43.799
I came by to apologise for requesting
your presence at the crime scene today.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.235
No, you didn't.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.355
And in hopes that you had
assessed the remains

04:48.440 --> 04:51.955
found down by the river
nearly three hours ago.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.275
So long? Horrors.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.633
I must have been
doing something very important.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.795
Now what could that have been? Hmm?

05:05.720 --> 05:07.472
Oh, very well. Come on.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.839
So, we have the left forearm and hand,
the left foot.

05:12.920 --> 05:17.038
We have this torso section here
which contains a bit of liver.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.591
At first blush, the victim is male.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.959
Thirty five,
judging by the skin and hair.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.956
Time of death somewhere between
7:00 and 10:00 p.m. last evening.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.392
Eight hours for the concrete to set.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.677
That places the killer down by the river
between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.835
Doctor, I'll need to take finger...

05:37.560 --> 05:40.358
Fortunately, I did absorb
some of the sleuthing techniques

05:40.440 --> 05:41.839
from the lads at Scotland Yard.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.310
Incidentally, these clean cuts here

05:45.960 --> 05:48.713
indicate an axe was used
for the dismemberment.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.198
After the time of death, I hope.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.754
And what did you learn from
the bone and tissue analysis?

05:56.280 --> 05:57.838
I'll tell you when I get to it.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.554
Doctor, this is somewhat
of an urgent matter.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.716
This may come as a bit of a shock
to you, Murdoch,

06:03.800 --> 06:06.394
but people have this unfortunate
habit of dying.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.398
Sometimes in bunches,
as is the case this week.

06:16.320 --> 06:17.639
- May I take this...
- Yes.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.312
So long as you leave me in peace.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.912
Assuming the rest of the body
was similarly disposed of,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.958
the killer would have required
several containers

06:32.520 --> 06:34.238
in which to mould the cement.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.156
This pattern would indicate that
the containers were made of wood.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.628
I make this out to be pine.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.440
Now then, the river was quite shallow
where we found the block.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.036
So the killer must have loaded
the rest of Humpty Dumpty

06:45.120 --> 06:46.633
onto a boat and headed
for deeper waters.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.550
And, unaccountably, left one behind.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.400
Well, I suppose, sir, if it was
the middle of the night and pitch,

06:52.480 --> 06:54.357
he could have simply lost track,
left one on shore.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.679
At any rate,
please take the victim's finger marks

06:57.760 --> 06:59.990
- and compare them to the ones on file.
- Yes, sir.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.037
I hear you and Dr Francis
had words again.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.558
Sir, Dr Francis is exaggerating.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.835
Listen here, Murdoch.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.470
Dr Francis was one of the Yard's best

07:13.720 --> 07:15.551
or I wouldn't have fought
to get him to Toronto.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.913
Now how does it look for me with you two
arguing the toss for months on end?

07:19.400 --> 07:21.550
Now, I won't tell you again.

07:23.720 --> 07:24.835
Or what, sir?

07:27.120 --> 07:28.189
Excuse me, sirs.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.352
The man who telephoned us
on behalf of the McMurphy sisters

07:30.440 --> 07:32.112
is here to give a statement.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.755
Malcolm Lamb.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.435
You know him, sirs?

07:37.480 --> 07:40.472
Detective Malcolm Lamb
used to have Murdoch's job.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.475
My, my, my, same desks,
same god-awful paint.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.230
Of course, there were no telephones
or fancy typewriters.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.151
I don't know how you live
with this racket.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.389
Perhaps you'd care to give
your statement

07:58.480 --> 07:59.674
in your old office, Detective.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.516
Well, thoughtful gesture, Inspector.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.556
But that's Detective Murdoch's
office now.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.035
Of course. As you wish.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.469
My office, then.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.109
That's it, really.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.835
Poor Miss McMurphy's eyes as big
as an owl's when I opened the door.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.752
How did you hold yourself back
from the crime scene?

08:19.120 --> 08:21.634
Oh, I still have a copper's nose for
a blood trail, Inspector.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.392
But sleep and a regular constitution
are my priorities now.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.637
How about a few tall tales
of Station Four's glory days?

08:29.200 --> 08:30.235
Glory days.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.080
Yeah. When I started
as a constable 20 years ago,

08:33.159 --> 08:35.196
the coppers couldn't find their noses.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.793
They were appointed by aldermen
and rich people they were related to.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.070
We pretty much got paid
to break up brawls

08:42.159 --> 08:44.355
and keep the city safe for Protestants.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.632
Detective Murdoch's progressive approach
hasn't escaped my notice, however.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.792
I'm optimistic that a whole new world
of policing is dawning.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.476
- Thank you, sir.
- Detective Lamb.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.230
Hodge! My God, you're still here!

08:59.480 --> 09:00.799
They'll have to carry me out, sir.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.791
Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.713
- Nice to see you.
- How are you?

09:10.880 --> 09:12.552
Interesting that he didn't mention

09:12.640 --> 09:14.835
he'd been given the boot
eight years ago for insubordination.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.717
I hadn't heard that.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.394
Put his Inspector Cassidy in hospital
for a week with a right hook.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.588
Have to admire it, in a way.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.956
Back then,
it was clear what men were thinking.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.629
Detective.

09:30.920 --> 09:34.549
Sir, I think this case has all
the makings of a ripping detective tale.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.991
A dismembered body
encased in concrete...

09:37.320 --> 09:40.949
A foul-smelling river to represent
society's rapid decay...

09:41.400 --> 09:43.960
- Bird watchers...
- What on earth are you doing, George?

09:44.040 --> 09:45.473
Doing? No, nothing, sir. I just...

09:45.640 --> 09:47.995
I've often thought I should write
some of these things down, you know?

09:48.080 --> 09:50.548
Well, you can add traces
of cement to your list.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.870
Yes, cement. Cement could represent...

09:54.320 --> 09:55.389
Oh, you mean you found cement?

09:56.360 --> 09:58.396
So, what, then?
The rest of the body was dumped nearby?

09:58.480 --> 09:59.549
In deeper water, perhaps?

09:59.760 --> 10:01.478
Yes. Or even in the lake.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.319
And then he rowed back to this spot.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.348
George, impound this boat
and dust it for finger mar...

10:07.760 --> 10:08.749
Detective?

10:08.840 --> 10:10.478
Constable,
I believe we're being watched.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.394
- Identify yourself.
- Sir.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.038
- Identify yourself!
- Sir!

10:36.280 --> 10:37.838
He appears to be a squatter, sir.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.035
What's your name?

10:45.560 --> 10:46.595
Detective?

10:50.080 --> 10:51.832
Dismembered human remains

10:52.440 --> 10:56.194
were found encased in concrete
not far from your... living quarters.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.952
Can you explain why traces of concrete
were also found in your boat?

11:00.040 --> 11:02.508
No. I told you, it was stolen.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.718
I didn't chop anyone up.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.353
- Can we at least have your name?
- I'm not obliged...!

11:14.840 --> 11:19.197
Arthur Frumm. F-R-U-double-M.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.548
Thank you, Mr Frumm.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.272
Can you account
for your whereabouts last night?

11:25.640 --> 11:26.675
Well, let's see.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.998
After I cooked up a nice squirrel stew
for my supper,

11:31.720 --> 11:37.511
I found a fine bottle of gin by my tent.

11:37.800 --> 11:38.915
There.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.157
I cancelled my theatre plans.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.433
You say you found this bottle?

11:46.760 --> 11:49.069
Gin from an angel, I took it as.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.031
I take it you consumed its contents?

11:54.160 --> 11:55.832
You don't want to anger the angels.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.834
I passed out just after dark.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.038
Mr Frumm, I believe
you know who those remains belong to.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.190
Squirrel. Couple rabbits.
I didn't eat that raccoon.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.918
It was just bothering me.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.355
No, the human remains, Mr Frumm.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.589
If you come forward now,

12:13.680 --> 12:16.717
before tests reveal that it is indeed
human blood on that axe,

12:16.800 --> 12:18.313
it may save you from the noose.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.271
And tell me why I should care.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.311
They should just make sure they get
the name right on the headstone.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.592
Arthur H. Frumm,

12:33.400 --> 12:35.391
barrister and solicitor.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.309
Loving husband

12:41.200 --> 12:42.315
and father.

12:49.480 --> 12:50.629
<i>A lawyer?</i>

12:50.840 --> 12:52.956
And they say
God doesn't have a sense of humour.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.077
Murdoch, there are drunks and lunatics
all along the river.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.794
You can't believe a word they say.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.508
And most of them would bash you
over the head for no bloody reason.

13:04.960 --> 13:10.239
Frumm plots to kill a fellow squatter
over some trivial nonsense,

13:10.440 --> 13:12.431
gets together what he needs
and does the deed.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.474
Then he starts drinking,
waiting for the cement to dry.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.034
But he's so drunk, he fails to notice
and leaves a block on shore.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.709
Sirs?

13:21.240 --> 13:23.754
No matches on file to our
victim's finger marks, I'm afraid.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.991
But I did put a call in to Osgoode Hall

13:26.080 --> 13:27.798
and Arthur H. Frumm did practise
family law

13:27.880 --> 13:29.598
here in Toronto about 20 years ago.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.838
Apparently he was disbarred for...

13:32.480 --> 13:35.313
"Persistent personal failings. "
Shame, if you ask me.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.272
Any upright citizen
can come to ruin, Crabtree.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.078
We must all be vigilant.

13:39.840 --> 13:40.909
Yes, to be sure, sir.

13:42.240 --> 13:46.279
George, take a few men and question
as many squatters as you can find.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.828
Perhaps Mr Frumm was seen
elsewhere in the valley.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.309
Sir, I will do. Also, Dr Francis called.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.515
He has some news for you.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.192
Ah. Thank you, George.

13:57.640 --> 13:58.675
Ah, Murdoch.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.670
Well, it's only preliminary

14:02.080 --> 14:06.232
but unless you're prepared to charge our
suspect with "rodenticide"

14:06.440 --> 14:07.998
I think you'd better look elsewhere.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.908
- No human blood on the axe.
- None at all.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.958
There is this, however.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.112
There is some scarring to the arm stump.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.871
You see? Here.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.678
Your victim has had surgery
to his forearm at some point.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.229
What kind of surgery?

14:26.800 --> 14:27.869
I'm sure I don't know.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.433
Now, I must away to my lovely wife.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.149
Since our return to her native soil,
there's rarely an evening goes by

14:37.240 --> 14:40.038
that we don't visit
her dear friends and family.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.190
And all of that dreadful
Canadian cheese.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.991
Doctor, have you had a chance to examine
the liver section in any detail?

14:49.280 --> 14:51.350
No. If I had, I would have told you.

14:52.280 --> 14:53.315
Then, when?

14:53.440 --> 14:55.635
What, two days? Three?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.069
And you're welcome.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.149
<i>Dear Julia,</i>

15:10.520 --> 15:12.431
<i>I trust this finds you well.</i>

15:13.120 --> 15:16.157
<i>I am forwarding photographic evidence
in a puzzling case</i>

15:16.240 --> 15:18.196
<i>and would be grateful for your insight.</i>

15:18.600 --> 15:19.635
<i>All my...</i>

15:24.040 --> 15:25.155
<i>Best regards,</i>

15:27.320 --> 15:28.389
<i>William.</i>

15:29.280 --> 15:30.315
Detective?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.840
Pardon my saying,
but the nature of this crime, sir,

15:35.920 --> 15:37.558
with the dismemberment
and the construction

15:37.640 --> 15:39.312
of boxes, the concrete and whatnot,

15:39.640 --> 15:42.871
it suggests a clear head
and a steady hand,

15:42.960 --> 15:44.279
neither of which Frumm possesses.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.798
We have only Mr Frumm's claims of being
dead drunk last night

15:47.880 --> 15:50.314
and no other finger marks besides his
were found on the boat.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.555
Hmm.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.309
What's that you have there, sir?

15:54.880 --> 15:57.110
It's a... gift for an acquaintance.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.678
I'd be happy to wrap that for you, sir.
I have this flair for gift wrapping.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.589
Not that the lads need to know that.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.110
I'm fine. Goodnight.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.273
<i>Dear William,
a delight to hear from you</i>

16:20.400 --> 16:22.152
<i>and for such an intriguing reason.</i>

16:22.680 --> 16:24.796
<i>Regarding the evidence
in the photographs,</i>

16:25.040 --> 16:27.508
<i>I believe the scar tissue
on the wrist may be</i>

16:27.600 --> 16:31.479
<i>the result of a radical new procedure
we've only just heard about here.</i>

16:31.800 --> 16:32.869
<i>It's called...</i>

16:32.960 --> 16:34.234
Transplantology?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.835
Yes, sir. It's an experimental
vascular surgery

16:36.920 --> 16:39.195
where a damaged artery is removed

16:39.280 --> 16:41.191
and replaced with a healthy one
from the patient.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.753
Dr Francis knows his stuff.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.433
Not many would have caught this,
Murdoch.

16:47.960 --> 16:51.191
Yes. I've contacted the only surgeon
in Canada to perform this procedure,

16:51.560 --> 16:54.120
a Dr Leeson in Vancouver,

16:54.200 --> 16:56.270
and he telegrammed me to say

16:56.360 --> 16:58.430
that he had performed
one such procedure here in Toronto.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.635
On whom?

17:00.400 --> 17:01.549
Duncan Burnside.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.755
The Duncan Burnside?

17:04.760 --> 17:05.829
Bloody hell, Murdoch.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.868
Are you telling me that
Toronto's Citizen of the Year has been

17:09.440 --> 17:10.509
hacked to pieces?

17:11.200 --> 17:13.031
Yes, sir, I believe I am.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.795
Crikey.

17:25.160 --> 17:26.229
I don't understand.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.636
Duncan was supposed to be in Winnipeg
finalising details on an orphanage.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.112
And now you tell me
someone did such horrible things.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.069
Mrs Burnside,

17:37.160 --> 17:39.754
are you aware of anyone
your husband may have quarrelled with?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.037
Anyone who may have
wished ill will towards him?

17:42.120 --> 17:43.189
No.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.713
Never a mean word,
towards him or from him.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.396
My husband was a champion for children

17:50.480 --> 17:52.630
and now his own
will grow up without a father.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.479
It's too cruel.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.949
- Ah, Brackenreid, you wanted to see me.
- Yes. Yes, Doctor.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.948
I wanted to commend you
on your excellent work in identifying

18:08.040 --> 18:09.951
that Duncan Burnside was the victim
in that concrete.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.111
Well, you're very welcome.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.552
Now what the hell are you talking about?

18:14.640 --> 18:17.108
What? Duncan Burnside.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.276
He'd had that
new transplantology surgery.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.954
What on earth is transplantology, man?

18:22.440 --> 18:23.475
Oh.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.109
Oh.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.269
Hmm?

18:27.360 --> 18:28.395
Scotch?

18:30.640 --> 18:31.709
Huh.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.589
He's taken photographs.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.233
He's taken photographs
and sent them to another doctor!

18:38.400 --> 18:40.709
- Another doctor, you say?
- He's undermined me!

18:40.920 --> 18:42.638
Murdoch does do
his fair share of reading.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.391
Oddball medical journals and the like.
Perhaps transplantology got a mention!

18:46.480 --> 18:47.913
Oh, don't be ridiculous, man!

18:50.680 --> 18:51.749
No.

18:52.280 --> 18:56.432
If Murdoch expects me to expedite work
on his cases from now on,

18:56.520 --> 18:58.954
he is woefully misinformed.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.798
Duncan Burnside's post-mortem is moved.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.229
Back of the queue!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.069
Back of the queue!

19:10.440 --> 19:13.000
It could be a week before I know
the cause of death with any certainty.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.230
That's far too long
in any murder investigation.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.594
It's your own bloody fault, Murdoch.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.996
Dr Llewellyn Francis is nobody's fool.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.435
I needed information
so I took the initiative.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.431
Oh, well, bloody medals all over you!

19:23.720 --> 19:25.073
I identified the victim.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.713
Did you have to go to Dr Ogden?

19:27.480 --> 19:28.879
Francis is old school, Murdoch.

19:29.120 --> 19:32.192
When he realises he's been upstaged
by a woman, he'll feel humiliated!

19:33.480 --> 19:35.789
- Or was that the plan?
- Of course not.

19:35.880 --> 19:38.314
I had to get the truth.
And I would do it again.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.359
Do you have any vague impression
that you've gone slightly crackers?

19:41.880 --> 19:43.029
This is not like you, Murdoch.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.349
I don't see it that way.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.192
No, no, no, no. Of course you don't.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.198
What did Mrs Burnside have to say?

19:55.040 --> 19:56.837
She said her husband was widely beloved.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.475
Don't they all.
Any mention of Arthur Frumm?

19:59.880 --> 20:00.915
She'd never heard the name.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.119
Well. We can't hold him
any longer, then. Off he goes.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.636
Have Crabtree chat up Burnside's
business associates

20:07.720 --> 20:09.551
and any gentleman doorstops
that he ran with.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.953
There might be a nervous nellie
in the bunch.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.109
Yes, sir.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.358
<i>Dear William,
I trust I was of some help.</i>

20:33.880 --> 20:36.189
<i>It brought back memories
of working together.</i>

20:36.280 --> 20:38.430
<i>Please thank Dr Francis
for sharing the photographs.</i>

20:38.760 --> 20:41.479
<i>And if you need someone to talk to,
do not hesitate.</i>

20:42.160 --> 20:43.195
<i>All my best,</i>

20:43.520 --> 20:44.635
<i>Julia.</i>

20:56.280 --> 20:58.271
So you're at war with a coroner...

20:58.680 --> 20:59.749
Thank you.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.951
And you had to let your squatter
suspect go.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.951
Frustrations of the job, eh, Detective?

21:05.480 --> 21:06.549
In truth, I don't miss them.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.592
But surely you didn't invite me
here to discuss

21:09.680 --> 21:11.318
something you've handled many times

21:11.440 --> 21:13.590
in your illustrious career.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.149
Well, it's not so much my situation
as it is yours.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.993
To what situation do you refer?

21:24.120 --> 21:25.394
Your leaving the constabulary.

21:25.480 --> 21:26.515
Oh.

21:26.840 --> 21:29.229
I suppose it was mostly that, one day,

21:30.040 --> 21:32.349
I found my enthusiasm for the job
had left me.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.076
Yet you put your inspector
in the hospital.

21:35.840 --> 21:39.276
Well, not to speak ill of the dead,
but Cassidy was an ass.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.349
And that was it?

21:43.400 --> 21:44.799
You're an intuitive bugger, aren't you?

21:45.800 --> 21:46.869
I do hope so.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.871
Well... The other shoe, then.

21:54.120 --> 21:57.112
I had been engaged for many years.
I kept postponing the wedding.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.675
Too wrapped up in the job,
my fiancée said.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.992
Next thing,
it was her or the job, and...

22:06.920 --> 22:10.515
When I didn't answer right away,
she broke it off for good.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.793
Why these inquiries, Detective?

22:15.720 --> 22:16.755
Curious.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.350
Word of advice,
never allow affairs of the heart

22:20.440 --> 22:24.115
to interfere with
more important affairs of the world.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.795
With policing these days,
and your innovations,

22:27.320 --> 22:30.869
a difference can be made.
That's your calling, Murdoch.

22:34.040 --> 22:38.397
At times, it seems as though
there are just too many obstacles.

22:38.840 --> 22:39.909
Yes.

22:40.640 --> 22:43.438
Obstacles to justice
and to personal contentment

22:43.520 --> 22:46.353
will always plague men like us.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.148
A detective's career
is entirely composed

22:50.240 --> 22:52.754
of refusing to accept anything less

22:53.080 --> 22:57.312
than the one, correct outcome.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.031
Obstacles be damned.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.354
- What have you got there, Murdoch?
- Sir, this telegram...

23:31.600 --> 23:32.669
Brackenreid?

23:33.200 --> 23:36.636
Over the weekend, all evidence
in the Duncan Burnside murder case

23:36.720 --> 23:38.472
has been stolen from my morgue.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.835
Murdoch has shipped it to his Dr Ogden.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.670
I've checked with the CN office.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.911
Have you taken leave of your senses,
Murdoch?

23:47.480 --> 23:49.436
They could knock you back
to a constable's rank for this.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.149
Sir. Dr Ogden's report.

23:52.240 --> 23:53.559
Deal with him,

23:53.760 --> 23:55.239
in the severest possible manner.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.115
Tell him, Murdoch.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.156
It wasn't only the remains
of Duncan Burnside

24:01.240 --> 24:03.196
in that concrete block, Dr Francis.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.156
But the body parts
of three separate victims.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.555
Let me see.

24:19.320 --> 24:22.392
Elevated serum urate levels
in the liver section.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.154
This victim had gout.

24:25.200 --> 24:30.399
And clear evidence of mucocutaneous
lesions. Just at the foot.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.956
This is the syphilitic victim.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.358
And Duncan Burnside's
transplantology surgery makes three.

24:36.440 --> 24:40.319
Correct.
I can confirm your Dr Ogden's findings.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.877
Also, I've noticed this.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.757
Trace residue of gunshot powder

24:48.840 --> 24:52.515
on the torso section here. But this
was obscured by the cement mixture.

24:52.600 --> 24:56.149
So it's likely the victims were shot
to death and then hacked to pieces?

24:56.240 --> 24:57.559
Well, this one was, certainly.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.954
Something caught your eye, Detective?

25:04.120 --> 25:06.509
Dr Ogden speculated that
the victim's foot

25:06.600 --> 25:08.989
had been bound with rope or some such.

25:09.080 --> 25:12.755
I would concur but for this faint
mottling here, do you see?

25:12.840 --> 25:15.115
That's consistent with
a more constant pressure.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.555
I'd say this victim had been shackled.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.309
Are you sure, Doctor?

25:19.400 --> 25:21.789
I was prison medical officer at Newgate
for three years

25:21.880 --> 25:23.438
before I joined the Yard.
I think I'd know.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.953
So it's likely the syphilitic victim

25:26.040 --> 25:27.792
- did hard time in prison?
- Yes.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.512
All of this information would have been
quite useful much earlier.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.638
I'd say you didn't help yourself
in that regard.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.869
A modicum of restraint
would have served you better.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.395
Excellent work, Doctor.

25:43.880 --> 25:44.915
Murdoch?

25:48.200 --> 25:49.349
In here now.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.550
I hope you realise how lucky you are,
Murdoch.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.675
Lucky, sir?

25:58.760 --> 26:00.113
If it had been one victim
and not three,

26:00.200 --> 26:02.031
you'd be facing charges
for what you just pulled.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.516
- As I explained, I needed...
- Murdoch!

26:05.120 --> 26:06.758
I give you a wide field
more often than not.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.478
And I expect that to count
for something.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.675
And it does, sir.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.719
You've got some bloody cheek.

26:12.480 --> 26:16.029
And if you ever, ever do something
like this again, I will rein you in.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.429
Do we have an understanding?

26:19.600 --> 26:20.669
Yes, sir.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.075
Right, then.

26:23.960 --> 26:28.715
So, we've got one Citizen of the Year,
one syphilitic ex-convict,

26:28.880 --> 26:30.871
one unknown with gout
and no solid suspects.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.833
Bloody hell. We're almost home.

26:33.360 --> 26:36.432
If we can find a way to somehow link
all three of the victims together,

26:36.960 --> 26:38.678
perhaps a new suspect will emerge.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.551
How does a swell like Burnside

26:41.640 --> 26:43.517
connect to a jailbird
with the French fever anyway?

26:44.560 --> 26:46.949
- That's a very good question.
- I get one out now and then.

26:49.640 --> 26:50.675
Now go find the answer.

26:53.600 --> 26:56.273
Sirs, of the prisoners
released last week from Don Jail,

26:56.360 --> 26:58.510
only one was syphilitic.
A Cyrus Wheeler.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.113
Served five years
hard labour for assault.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.318
- How old is Wheeler?
- He's 38, sir.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.072
- Close enough.
- He attacked a fellow roomer

27:04.160 --> 27:06.435
in a boarding house. He beat him
to within an inch of his life.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.953
So this man waits until Wheeler

27:08.040 --> 27:09.473
is released from prison,
then goes after him.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.028
But why kill Burnside
and the other unknown victim?

27:12.400 --> 27:13.469
How the hell do I know?

27:14.200 --> 27:15.394
Find this roomer and bring him in.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.353
I would, sir, but he died two years ago.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.236
You could have mentioned that
right off the bat, Higgins.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.669
Didn't want to interrupt.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.112
Every time we put two pieces
of this jigsaw together,

27:27.200 --> 27:28.952
we get a third that won't fit.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.594
Yes, sir, very frustrating.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.155
Sirs, the constabulary in Coboconk

27:34.240 --> 27:36.549
received a missing persons report
this morning

27:36.920 --> 27:38.035
from a Wilma Jelton.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.038
Apparently, her brother, Oslo Jelton

27:40.120 --> 27:43.157
was to be staying at the Empire Hotel
here in Toronto and he didn't show up.

27:43.440 --> 27:44.668
- Cobo what?
- Coboconk.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.069
Coboconk.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.276
Yes, sir, I believe it means
the part of the river

27:48.360 --> 27:50.476
where the gull prefers to nest.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.755
I used to visit my Aunt Clematis there.
She worked in the brick kiln.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.239
Crabtree, where the hell is it?

27:55.840 --> 27:56.909
It's a few hours north, sir.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.869
Coboconk.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.309
Safe travels, Murdoch.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.469
Whoa.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.399
- Miss Jelton?
- Yes.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.275
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto constabulary.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.359
Have you any news of my brother?

28:16.160 --> 28:17.275
That's Oslo.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.915
And he lived here?

28:20.080 --> 28:22.196
Yes, our family moved here

28:22.280 --> 28:24.430
when Oslo graduated
from the University of Toronto.

28:26.120 --> 28:29.749
Miss Jelton, if I may, did your brother
have any ongoing physical ailments?

28:30.240 --> 28:31.912
No. Nothing serious.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.873
Mild dyspepsia, a touch of gout.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.349
Is it important?

28:37.600 --> 28:38.919
Just a routine question.

28:39.720 --> 28:42.632
Did you happen to know the nature
of your brother's trip to Toronto?

28:43.120 --> 28:44.633
I don't know, I'm sure.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.314
But I found this yesterday
in Oslo's study.

28:47.480 --> 28:51.075
I believe it's the reason why he left
so hurriedly without explanation.

28:51.280 --> 28:54.317
"A situation requiring
our immediate attention has arisen.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.951
"My carriage will pick you up Thursday
at the Drake Hotel, 7 pm. "

28:59.360 --> 29:01.271
The telegram is signed by a "D.B."

29:01.360 --> 29:04.193
Did your brother ever mention the name
Duncan Burnside?

29:04.480 --> 29:05.549
No. Who is he?

29:07.720 --> 29:10.280
We've identified Duncan Burnside
as a murder victim.

29:12.040 --> 29:15.749
Detective, Oslo could not have had
a single thing to do with any murder.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.071
No, ma'am, that's not what I'm saying.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.714
No? Then...

29:25.320 --> 29:26.389
Midnight oil?

29:27.120 --> 29:28.599
Sir, have a look at this.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.636
Oslo Jelton and Duncan Burnside,
members of the same fraternity.

29:34.880 --> 29:35.949
Hmm.

29:36.560 --> 29:39.791
What's low life Cyrus Wheeler
doing with a pair of toffs like these?

29:41.480 --> 29:42.959
- Yes, constable.
- Sir,

29:43.240 --> 29:44.434
I've been thinking about it

29:45.000 --> 29:47.912
and I believe I recognise
the name Oslo Jelton.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.677
- Come in. Come in, Hodge.
- Of course, sir.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.149
Do you recognise him?

29:54.080 --> 29:55.195
Yes. That's him.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.149
How did you know him?

29:57.520 --> 30:00.990
Jelton was a suspect in a rape
and murder case about 10 years ago.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.153
Dig out the case file, Constable.

30:05.080 --> 30:08.436
Harriet King was a secretarial
school instructor, it would seem.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.198
And Oslo Jelton was involved.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.517
That's correct, sir. Apparently, Jelton
was brought in for questioning.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.994
An eyewitness, a pub owner,
Richard Duff,

30:17.080 --> 30:19.435
claims to have seen Jelton
running from the scene of the crime.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.398
Right. But the pub owner recanted.

30:21.560 --> 30:22.595
Sir...

30:22.880 --> 30:26.395
Mr Jelton's alibi that he was studying
in the university library

30:26.760 --> 30:28.990
was corroborated by two witnesses.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.676
A groundskeeper and a fellow student.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.070
The fellow student was Duncan Burnside.

30:34.280 --> 30:37.875
Let me guess.
The groundskeeper was Cyrus Wheeler.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.749
Excellent. Now we know how
the three victims were connected.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.878
Yes, George. But we still
have no idea who killed them.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.156
What's that?
The Harriet King crime scene?

30:51.560 --> 30:53.676
Yes, sir.
Miss King's body was discovered

30:53.760 --> 30:55.876
in the back of the alleyway here.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.875
And Oslo Jelton was allegedly seen here
fleeing the scene of the crime.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.356
- The eyewitness?
- Richard Duff.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.437
Originally claims to have come out

31:04.520 --> 31:06.397
of the back of his pub
into the laneway here.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.948
And that's when he saw
Oslo Jelton running south,

31:09.040 --> 31:11.076
out of the laneway here toward Richmond.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.915
And then, a few days later,
he says he never saw Jelton there.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.799
Be nice to know why he changed his mind.

31:17.120 --> 31:21.113
Sirs, the day after Miss King was found,
the Gazette quotes Inspector Cassidy

31:21.200 --> 31:23.714
as saying he believed more than one man
was involved in the attack.

31:24.160 --> 31:26.515
However in this edition,
published just a couple of days later,

31:27.240 --> 31:28.309
he has a different theory.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.389
Only one killer.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.432
And Burnside and Wheeler walk in
with Jelton's alibi

31:32.520 --> 31:34.158
and everyone goes back to sleep,

31:34.440 --> 31:35.668
including the broadsheets.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.038
It's got a very ripe odour, doesn't it?

31:40.680 --> 31:42.432
We need to find
this pub owner first thing.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.072
Your predecessor might shed some light.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.229
Malcolm Lamb?

31:47.760 --> 31:48.829
Good idea, sir.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.515
Twice in a week.

31:58.520 --> 31:59.589
Harriet King.

32:01.400 --> 32:03.231
Was she the one thrown off
the Laird building?

32:04.400 --> 32:07.790
No. No, she was raped and murdered
in an alleyway behind the...

32:07.880 --> 32:12.476
Oh, yes. Yes. Downtown somewhere.
The Dominion Ale House.

32:12.560 --> 32:13.675
That's the one, yes.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.354
Lord, lord, lord.
I was only a constable.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.474
What does Harriet King have to do
with anything, God rest her soul?

32:20.360 --> 32:23.716
The cement block that we found
contained the remains of three victims.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.596
- Three?
- Yes.

32:26.880 --> 32:29.838
And Miss King's murder
links all three of them together.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.554
But there was just one suspect,
wasn't there?

32:32.640 --> 32:33.789
Oslo Jelton, yes.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.549
He's one of the victims.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.788
And the two men that provided his alibi
are the other two victims.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.951
Cyrus Wheeler and Duncan Burnside.

32:43.200 --> 32:46.510
Burnside? Citizen of the Year?

32:46.960 --> 32:48.678
Wouldn't want to be
in your shoes right now, Murdoch.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.669
Who's this Wheeler?

32:51.880 --> 32:55.190
A groundskeeper that Burnside and Jelton
knew from university.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.315
Don't recall the name.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.352
Well, I won't take up
any more of your time.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.630
Glad to see
the wind back in your sails, Murdoch.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.189
Suits you better.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.799
- Thank you, Mr Lamb.
- Good day.

33:11.920 --> 33:15.879
Now, sir, I found Richard Duff in a ward
in the House of Providence.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.916
It seems 30 years of pub life
has caught up with him.

33:18.800 --> 33:22.475
I spoke with a nurse there, sir.
She says he's got a few weeks at most.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.469
Very good, George.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.269
Mr Duff?

33:33.680 --> 33:35.193
I'm Detective William Murdoch.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.437
That constable says
this is about Harriet King.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.589
Yes.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.800
I'm curious as to why
your statements to the police

33:44.880 --> 33:48.077
in the days after the
Harriet King murder were contradictory.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.838
I got it wrong the first time.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.309
Call it sober reflection.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.713
So you're saying that
when you stepped out into that alley,

33:58.840 --> 34:00.831
and saw Oslo Jelton running away

34:00.920 --> 34:02.956
from Harriet King's body,
you were drunk.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.910
I was always corned back then
and it wasn't Jelton.

34:08.600 --> 34:12.228
Some stranger.
Jelton was a regular, so I would know.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.277
You knew Oslo Jelton personally?

34:16.239 --> 34:18.150
So there'd be no way to misidentify him?

34:18.560 --> 34:19.629
Right.

34:20.520 --> 34:24.228
But you did misidentify him.
So you said.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.119
I saw what I saw.

34:30.239 --> 34:31.309
Harriet King.

34:32.679 --> 34:39.233
Raped by Oslo Jelton, strangled,
and left in the alley like garbage.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.589
Look at her, Mr Duff.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.514
Look at her!

34:45.440 --> 34:46.589
You knew what happened.

34:47.080 --> 34:50.117
You had justice for Harriet King
in your hands. You still do.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.511
By God, man,
before it's too late for you.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.149
The truth.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.794
Yes, I saw Jelton...

35:03.600 --> 35:06.910
Running away.
It was him, but he was yelling.

35:07.680 --> 35:08.749
Yelling?

35:08.840 --> 35:11.229
For some mates to wait up.

35:11.320 --> 35:15.393
And I heard two voices shout back
to hurry the hell up, I swear.

35:16.760 --> 35:17.829
Did you see these two men?

35:18.520 --> 35:20.556
Earlier. They'd been in the pub

35:20.640 --> 35:22.676
with Jelton, earlier that night,
getting slewed.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.872
So you saw them in the pub together?

35:25.080 --> 35:27.719
Well, one was a toff, like Jelton.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.109
The other was...

35:29.760 --> 35:31.637
I figured they were slumming

35:31.720 --> 35:33.597
because he looked
a bit of a riff-raff. But this...

35:34.640 --> 35:36.676
Harriet... She was a nice girl. Nice...

35:37.400 --> 35:38.435
Those boys...

35:39.560 --> 35:42.438
They were all around her that night.

35:42.520 --> 35:45.557
She said "Leave me alone!"
but they didn't.

35:46.720 --> 35:47.789
So she left.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.235
But they followed her.

35:50.160 --> 35:53.675
I told myself they were just going home.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.956
But after the poor girl...

35:58.880 --> 36:01.519
Mr Duff, why did you change your story?

36:02.840 --> 36:04.671
- The letter.
- What letter?

36:04.840 --> 36:06.592
The anonymous letter!

36:07.480 --> 36:12.031
That said if I didn't change my story,
the city would close my pub.

36:13.360 --> 36:16.238
I couldn't bear that. I had a family.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.916
Then, so I went along.

36:19.480 --> 36:23.553
I figured the letter came
from Jelton's old man and, well...

36:23.960 --> 36:26.030
He had connections back then, you know.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.477
- Indeed.
- I did what I was told!

36:29.400 --> 36:33.029
But then to hound me after,
like I'd done something wrong!

36:33.320 --> 36:34.355
That wasn't right.

36:34.880 --> 36:36.871
Mr Duff, I'm confused. Who hounded you?

36:36.960 --> 36:40.509
He kept after me for two years

36:40.960 --> 36:44.919
to change my story, to say
that it was Oslo Jelton that I saw

36:45.000 --> 36:46.877
but if I did that, I'd lose everything.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.269
Who? Who kept after you?

36:48.520 --> 36:50.317
That bloody constable!

36:50.560 --> 36:51.629
What constable?

36:52.920 --> 36:53.989
Lamb.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.639
Constable Lamb.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.275
Constable Hodge,

37:08.720 --> 37:10.551
did you know Detective Lamb

37:10.640 --> 37:12.471
during the days
of the Harriet King investigation?

37:13.160 --> 37:14.275
Only slightly, sir.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.393
I see. Thank you.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.955
I believe he was engaged at that time,

37:20.840 --> 37:21.909
to a lovely girl.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.549
<i>A Sarah Connolly.</i>

37:24.000 --> 37:25.911
Is Malcolm in any trouble, Detective?

37:26.520 --> 37:30.399
We're simply asking if anyone
recalls any details, however small,

37:31.040 --> 37:34.476
about an old murder case.
A young woman named Harriet King.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.753
I take it you recall the name.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.879
It was so sad, what happened.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.950
For Harriet, of course,
but also for Malcolm.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.117
Malcolm? How is that?

37:48.240 --> 37:50.231
He was bedevilled by that case.

37:50.840 --> 37:54.037
Such that he forgot about
everything else, myself included.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.117
You broke off your engagement
over the King case?

37:58.440 --> 37:59.555
His obsession with it.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.757
We had a beautiful life ahead of us.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.153
But I think what hurt most was

38:06.840 --> 38:10.674
losing him for reasons
I couldn't comprehend. And never will.

38:13.200 --> 38:18.274
If I may, did Malcolm ever mention
the names Burnside, Jelton, or Wheeler?

38:18.360 --> 38:19.918
Oh, I'd never forget those names.

38:20.320 --> 38:23.357
Malcolm was convinced
they'd raped and murdered Harriet King.

38:27.280 --> 38:28.554
Who was this Wheeler?

38:28.880 --> 38:30.233
A groundskeeper.

38:30.760 --> 38:31.875
Don't recall the name.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.231
I don't know if I should laugh or cry,
because, Murdoch,

38:39.320 --> 38:41.754
you know I couldn't have had
anything to do with these murders.

38:41.880 --> 38:42.995
I wish I did, Mr Lamb.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.430
- But the facts are the problem.
- What facts?

38:45.600 --> 38:48.239
As a constable, you were obsessed
with justice for Harriet King.

38:48.680 --> 38:49.715
Who told you I was obsessed?

38:50.120 --> 38:51.155
Sarah Connolly.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.711
Sarah? For goodness' sake.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.395
She was always complaining that I was
too interested in this case.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.194
Interested in a case that you told
Murdoch you barely remembered?

38:59.760 --> 39:02.194
I also interviewed
the pub owner Richard Duff.

39:02.600 --> 39:05.114
He told me you hounded him
long after the investigation

39:05.200 --> 39:06.918
to admit that it was, in fact,
Oslo Jelton

39:07.000 --> 39:08.752
he saw running from the alleyway.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.478
All right. Yes.
But I did that on my own time.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.118
I was just trying to make detective.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.509
Sirs,

39:13.600 --> 39:15.238
no evidence of any kind
in the house, I'm afraid.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.834
There. Can we please stop this nonsense?

39:32.800 --> 39:33.835
Mr Lamb,

39:35.000 --> 39:36.956
did you make these birdhouses recently?

39:37.720 --> 39:41.269
Yes. As a gift for the McMurphy sisters.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.478
Ah, yes, the bird watchers.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.480
Inspector, I make these out to be pine.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.272
I'm not certain
I see the criminal enterprise

39:51.360 --> 39:53.078
in building birdhouses, Detective.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.673
Unless it's to hide evidence
in plain sight, Mr Lamb.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.672
You waited a long time for Cyrus Wheeler
to be released from prison.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.628
Then you set your plan in motion.

40:05.200 --> 40:08.431
<i>You lured all three men to
the Drake Hotel with phoney telegrams.</i>

40:08.600 --> 40:10.238
Duncan, you in there?

40:11.760 --> 40:13.159
<i>You subdued the men,</i>

40:13.520 --> 40:14.794
<i>then drove them here.</i>

40:15.520 --> 40:16.839
No, please.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.759
<i>Where you shot them...</i>

40:20.160 --> 40:21.479
<i>And then chopped them to pieces.</i>

40:23.000 --> 40:25.070
And with the remains
hardening in cement,

40:25.160 --> 40:26.957
you fetched Arthur Frumm's boat,

40:27.280 --> 40:29.191
knowing full well
that he would be passed out

40:29.280 --> 40:32.238
from the gin bottle you left beside
his tent earlier that evening.

40:48.600 --> 40:49.715
I have a perfect match.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.873
Malcolm Lamb,
you're under arrest for murder.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.115
Your condemnation is misplaced,
Detective,

41:07.200 --> 41:09.395
unless you also condemn yourself.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.194
I don't follow, sir.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.435
You and I share a relentless devotion
to justice.

41:16.520 --> 41:19.034
It's what drives us and sets us apart.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.152
And this devotion to justice...

41:22.560 --> 41:25.757
Is that why you left one of the blocks
of remains by the river?

41:25.960 --> 41:30.158
So that we might find it, and possibly
solve Harriet King's murder?

41:30.520 --> 41:33.353
Yes, but I never thought
you'd track it back to me.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.478
I thought I could outfox you.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.475
Thought wrong.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.160
But if you had put all of the remains
in the river...

41:42.760 --> 41:44.830
It's likely you never
would have been found out,

41:45.640 --> 41:47.278
if you didn't want to be caught.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.836
It was a calculated risk, yes. But...

41:50.360 --> 41:51.475
There I was in the river,

41:51.800 --> 41:54.917
set to sink that last block,
when it occurred to me.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.636
These men
raped and murdered Harriet King.

42:02.240 --> 42:05.118
Yes, they deserved a tomb
like that foul river, but...

42:05.520 --> 42:06.589
Who would know?

42:07.520 --> 42:10.239
If I sank the block,
they'd be gone forever,

42:10.320 --> 42:12.595
without disgrace on their memory.

42:13.360 --> 42:16.636
And all I'd have done was leave
poor Harriet King in her eternal grave

42:16.720 --> 42:18.119
without a name to her killers and

42:19.360 --> 42:21.828
no justice at all for her.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.758
But why this case?

42:26.920 --> 42:28.831
Why did it obsess you so?

42:30.720 --> 42:32.711
I thought if I could just get
one right thing done,

42:32.800 --> 42:34.791
maybe the constabulary could change.

42:35.040 --> 42:38.396
Stand up to the rich and powerful
pulling the strings.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.191
Cassidy came to me one day to say

42:42.920 --> 42:46.595
if I ever hoped to make detective,
I'd have to forget about Harriet King,

42:46.920 --> 42:47.989
once and for all.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.230
That day, I made a deal with the Devil.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.949
It was no better than
the pub owner who recanted, or

43:00.160 --> 43:02.310
or the broadsheet editors who
dropped the story.

43:03.800 --> 43:06.030
At least, I was no better.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.869
Now, I am right with
God and Harriet King.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.432
I hope that sustains you in the few days
you have left to you, sir.

43:20.840 --> 43:21.909
Thank you, Detective.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.069
Detective?

43:31.680 --> 43:32.749
How is Sarah?

43:34.160 --> 43:35.195
She's well.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.359
She's concerned for you.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.073
Please tell her I'm fine.

43:45.920 --> 43:46.989
Truly fine.
