00:08.786 --> 00:10.352
My name is Nathan Fielder,

00:10.404 --> 00:12.104
and I graduated from one of Canada's

00:12.203 --> 00:14.836
top business schools
with really good grades.

00:15.567 --> 00:17.800
Now, I'm using my knowledge
to help struggling

00:17.867 --> 00:22.233
small business owners make it
in this competitive world.

00:22.300 --> 00:26.567
This is "Nathan for You."

00:26.633 --> 00:29.133
From the outside,
this building may look boring,

00:29.200 --> 00:31.967
but there's actually
something pretty cool inside.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.833
Byrnes Logistics,
a shipping logistics company

00:34.900 --> 00:37.100
based in El Segundo, California,

00:37.167 --> 00:39.567
where customs broker
Christy Pratt works tirelessly

00:39.633 --> 00:41.733
to help her clients
export their products

00:41.800 --> 00:43.567
all around the world.

00:43.633 --> 00:46.033
But sending goods across
international borders

00:46.100 --> 00:47.800
can be expensive
because of import taxes

00:47.867 --> 00:49.467
known as "tariffs."

00:49.533 --> 00:52.100
Every product has
a different duty rate.

00:52.167 --> 00:55.433
Um, it can be from free to 35%.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.433
But when I learned she
was working with an exporter

00:57.500 --> 01:00.061
of smoke detectors, it gave me an idea

01:00.067 --> 01:02.167
that could save her client millions,

01:02.233 --> 01:04.667
and make Christy the hottest
shipping broker in town.

01:04.733 --> 01:06.667
Just looking it up on my phone,
it seems like there's

01:06.733 --> 01:12.200
a pretty high tariff for smoke
detectors in a lot of countries.

01:12.267 --> 01:13.967
Yeah, I mean a lot of countries charge

01:14.067 --> 01:16.367
high duty rates on smoke detectors.

01:16.433 --> 01:18.700
You know, it is what it is.

01:18.767 --> 01:20.333
I mean, you're not gonna get around it.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.133
Well, not so fast.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.633
Unlike smoke detectors,
musical instruments

01:24.700 --> 01:26.867
ship duty-free to most countries.

01:26.933 --> 01:28.967
So, if Christy were able
to convince Customs

01:29.067 --> 01:30.767
that the noise from her smoke alarms

01:30.833 --> 01:33.167
was actually intended to make music,

01:33.233 --> 01:36.333
the savings for her clients
would be astronomical.

01:36.510 --> 01:40.846
_

01:46.167 --> 01:48.333
- Well...
- I mean, technically anything

01:48.400 --> 01:51.567
that makes a noise can be
a musical instrument, right?

01:53.700 --> 01:58.167
You know, if you can
convince Customs, go for it.

01:58.233 --> 02:00.100
Why are you so pessimistic?

02:00.167 --> 02:03.833
Because I've worked
in this business a long time.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.200
I know what Customs is going to say.

02:06.267 --> 02:07.967
You know I went
to business school, right?

02:08.067 --> 02:10.733
Yeah, no, I didn't. I don't know you.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.533
Oh, okay. I did go to business school.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.467
All right, well...

02:24.267 --> 02:25.600
Oh, you're done with your sentence?

02:25.667 --> 02:27.533
- I'm done.
- Okay.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.500
You said, "All right, well,"
and I thought you were

02:29.567 --> 02:31.067
gonna say something else.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.633
- No.
- Oh, okay.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.833
Christy was skeptical,
but I was determined

02:35.900 --> 02:38.367
to prove her wrong,
so I began the process

02:38.433 --> 02:40.900
of designing new packaging
for the smoke detector

02:40.967 --> 02:43.767
to rebrand it as a musical instrument.

02:43.833 --> 02:46.700
I then hired local
blues legend Harmonica Greg

02:46.767 --> 02:48.767
to help me create an instructional DVD

02:48.833 --> 02:50.767
that would be included in every box.

02:50.833 --> 02:53.967
Your instrument is pre-tuned to F#,

02:54.067 --> 02:56.067
and you don't want
to mess around with that.

02:56.100 --> 02:58.867
With our DVD and rebranded
packaging complete,

02:58.933 --> 03:01.067
I was hopeful this
would be enough for Customs

03:01.100 --> 03:03.167
to believe it was a real instrument.

03:03.233 --> 03:06.133
But since tariff laws
are incredibly complex,

03:06.200 --> 03:08.333
before moving forward,
I brought my product

03:08.400 --> 03:11.061
to retired California judge
Anthony Filosa

03:11.067 --> 03:14.567
to be sure I was meeting
all the requirements.

03:14.633 --> 03:16.433
It's a smoke detector.

03:16.500 --> 03:20.633
Right, but it's rebranded
as a musical instrument.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.567
And, of course, you're doing
that for what reason, to...

03:23.633 --> 03:25.700
To avoid the tariffs.

03:25.767 --> 03:27.567
After telling Judge Filosa my plan,

03:27.633 --> 03:29.700
he read over the tariff laws

03:29.767 --> 03:31.500
and told me that my work
was far from done.

03:31.567 --> 03:34.267
You've got to prove
to the satisfaction of a court

03:34.333 --> 03:37.833
that this particular thing is accepted

03:37.900 --> 03:40.467
by the general public
as a musical instrument.

03:40.533 --> 03:43.933
- Okay.
- This label proves nothing.

03:44.067 --> 03:46.933
So how would you make
it accepted by the public?

03:47.067 --> 03:51.133
If it's used in a song
that people really recognize,

03:51.200 --> 03:55.300
it's a #1 record, or, you know,
one of these singers...

03:55.367 --> 03:58.467
I knew that rebranding
a smoke detector would be tough,

03:58.533 --> 04:01.067
but I never thought I'd have
to create a hit song

04:01.100 --> 04:03.367
using one of the worst noises
imaginable.

04:03.433 --> 04:06.100
And if I was going to do this,

04:06.167 --> 04:08.067
I'd need some serious musical talent.

04:08.133 --> 04:10.433
So I put up some fliers

04:10.500 --> 04:12.767
announcing open
auditions for a new band.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.333
And later that week, posing
as a big-time record producer,

04:15.400 --> 04:17.300
I opened my doors

04:17.367 --> 04:19.060
to the best of what L.A. had to offer.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.666
All right,
let's see what you got, my man.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.067
Sure.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.900

04:29.967 --> 04:32.061

04:42.067 --> 04:44.100
The turnout was better than I expected,

04:44.167 --> 04:46.667
and it was clear right away
I was drowning in talent.

04:46.733 --> 04:49.867
♪ Arise, the time is now ♪

04:49.933 --> 04:52.233
So after auditioning
a drummer named Chris

04:52.300 --> 04:54.067
who could really pound the skins

04:54.133 --> 04:56.333
and Jani,
a physically attractive singer,

04:56.400 --> 04:58.067
who had the right kind of ambition...

04:58.100 --> 05:00.233
I mean, on a wider perspective, like,

05:00.300 --> 05:02.567
I want the whole world
to hear what I have to say.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.300
My band was starting to take shape.

05:04.367 --> 05:06.733
This is freedom to me.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.167
But I still needed
to figure out which musician

05:09.233 --> 05:11.767
was best suited
to playing the smoke detector.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.700
So I organized the band's
first rehearsal,

05:14.767 --> 05:16.233
and after watching them jam...

05:21.667 --> 05:25.133
It quickly became clear
the standout talent was Eddie.

05:28.367 --> 05:30.067
He was not only the best musician

05:30.133 --> 05:32.367
but also the best showman.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.800
If anyone could make the smoke
detector work, it was him.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.700
So after rehearsal was over,

05:36.767 --> 05:39.967
I kept Eddie behind
to show him his new instrument.

05:40.067 --> 05:41.967
I can sing, I can play the drums.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.500
This is not an instrument.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.700
It is. It's a blues smoke detector.

05:48.167 --> 05:50.133
No, no.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.967
This is gonna be the thing

05:52.067 --> 05:53.967
that separates us from any other band.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.433
Okay.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.933
And that means the guy who plays it

05:57.067 --> 05:58.700
is going to be the most famous.

05:58.767 --> 05:59.767
You want to be famous, don't you?

05:59.833 --> 06:03.567
Um...

06:03.633 --> 06:05.100
maybe.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.133
- You do.
- Yeah.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.567
Dazzled by the promise of fame,

06:09.633 --> 06:11.367
Eddie agreed to learn
the blues smoke detector

06:11.433 --> 06:13.700
with the help of our instructional DVD.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.633
The best way to play it

06:15.700 --> 06:19.467
is simply by pressing
the "test" button on the front.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.100
Okay.

06:24.633 --> 06:27.067
So with Eddie on board,
I spent the next couple days

06:27.100 --> 06:29.100
writing lyrics for
what would hopefully be

06:29.175 --> 06:30.552
our breakthrough single.

06:30.604 --> 06:32.411
And then I called the band
back together

06:32.454 --> 06:34.020
to see what they thought.

06:34.900 --> 06:37.533
So you know when you
really like a girl,

06:37.600 --> 06:40.133
but she won't even
look at you in the eye?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.533
- You know?
- Mmhmm.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.200
This song's, uh, kind of about that.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.333
Sorry, I'm just a little
nervous right now,

06:51.400 --> 06:53.133
because it's, you know, it's personal,

06:53.200 --> 06:55.367
and I'm not the best singer.

06:55.433 --> 06:58.200
But...

07:02.633 --> 07:05.300

07:38.267 --> 07:40.067
The band seemed to like my song...

07:40.133 --> 07:42.367
Thank you. But then Jani said

07:42.433 --> 07:44.500
that he had a song of his own
that he'd been working on.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.533
Through distancing ourselves
from nature,

07:46.600 --> 07:48.400
we've distanced
ourselves from each other,

07:48.467 --> 07:50.600
and the song's kind of based off that.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.967
I like that message.

07:53.067 --> 07:56.300
I mean, we need to respect
like the habitat we live in.

07:56.367 --> 08:00.567

08:00.633 --> 08:05.133

08:05.200 --> 08:07.967

08:08.067 --> 08:10.133
The song was called "Orphaned Skies,"

08:10.200 --> 08:13.067
and after taking a band vote,
they liked his song more.

08:13.100 --> 08:16.133
And that was great,
because the best song won,

08:16.200 --> 08:18.100
and that's what we wanted.

08:18.167 --> 08:20.600
So I told Jani to teach it
to the rest of the band,

08:20.667 --> 08:22.233
with one minor adjustment.

08:22.300 --> 08:25.933
Just so you guys know,
I took Eddie off guitar,

08:26.067 --> 08:28.433
and he's going to be
on smoke detector for this one.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.667
- Smoke detector?
- I know it's a bit weird,

08:30.733 --> 08:33.500
but it's really important this
band has a smoke detector in it.

08:33.567 --> 08:36.900
I think it could be the thing
that maybe makes us stand out.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.799
Do we have to have that one?

08:38.866 --> 08:40.799
- The smoke detector?
- Yes.

08:40.866 --> 08:42.933
I mean, no offense,
but if you guys are good enough,

08:43.067 --> 08:45.267
you should be able
to make it work, right?

with the smoke detector,

was sounding surprisingly good.

to take this band

09:16.733 --> 09:17.933
to the next level.

09:18.067 --> 09:20.367
So I hired a photographer

09:20.433 --> 09:22.233
to take some promotional photos

09:22.300 --> 09:23.867
and booked some time
in a recording studio

09:23.933 --> 09:26.167
to officially lay down the tracks.

Everyone in the studio was digging it,

09:39.833 --> 09:42.333
and I was hopeful "Orphaned
Skies" would become a hit.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.061
But first, our band would need a name.

09:45.067 --> 09:49.333
I have a few. The Banzai Predicament.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.133
What does that mean?

09:52.200 --> 09:55.233
Um... I don't know if it...

09:55.300 --> 09:58.167
it's just kind of like
a juxtaposition of words

09:58.233 --> 10:02.433
I came up with, it... it sounded good.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.433
Now that our band had a name,

10:04.500 --> 10:07.600
I uploaded our song
to iTunes as a digital single.

10:07.667 --> 10:10.067
And I was excited
to get this thing heard,

10:10.133 --> 10:12.133
so I set up a meeting
with the head of programming

10:12.200 --> 10:15.833
at KDAY 93.5 in the hopes
he would put it on the air.

10:24.033 --> 10:26.167
I don't think
that'll make Top 40 Radio.

10:26.233 --> 10:28.233
I couldn't play it. I wouldn't play it.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.333
Is there anything I could do to

10:30.400 --> 10:32.767
if this could get like one play on air,

10:32.833 --> 10:34.333
and see what the response is?

10:34.400 --> 10:36.333
Take the beeping sound out of it.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.667
Okay, yeah. And in that moment,

10:39.733 --> 10:42.300
I realized what I should've
known from the start.

10:42.367 --> 10:45.633
That the music industry
would never accept a song

10:45.700 --> 10:47.433
with a smoke detector in it.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.233
I had failed everyone.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.733
Not only Christy at Byrnes Logistics

10:52.800 --> 10:54.967
but also Jani, whose beautiful song

10:55.033 --> 10:57.467
would never be heard.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.467
But in listening to it more,

10:59.533 --> 11:02.567
I was reminded of the message
behind "Orphaned Skies."

11:02.633 --> 11:04.533
Through distancing ourselves
from nature,

11:04.600 --> 11:06.433
we've distanced
ourselves from each other.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.333
It was about saving the environment.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.367
And that's when it occurred to me

11:11.433 --> 11:13.400
that if I couldn't get
this song on the radio,

11:13.467 --> 11:15.933
perhaps I could get it on the news.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.900
Not far from Los Angeles,

11:17.967 --> 11:20.567
the Shell Oil Company
recently got into trouble

11:20.633 --> 11:22.700
after one of their
pipelines sprung a leak.

11:22.767 --> 11:25.067
For the second time in less
than a year,

11:25.133 --> 11:27.400
a spill response unit
has responded to this

11:27.467 --> 11:30.167
Shell facility outside of Tracy.

11:30.233 --> 11:32.367
So if I could make it seem like

11:32.433 --> 11:36.167
Jani's environmental anthem
was callously stolen by Shell

11:36.233 --> 11:39.067
to use in a PR campaign
at the spill site,

11:39.100 --> 11:42.700
there's a chance the controversy
could ignite a media firestorm

11:42.767 --> 11:45.900
that would get "Orphaned Skies"
and the blues smoke detector

11:45.967 --> 11:48.067
heard by millions.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.200
So to frame Shell for this theft,

11:50.267 --> 11:53.233
I headed five hours north to
the city of Tracy, California

11:53.300 --> 11:55.133
and put up fliers
saying that Shell would be

11:55.200 --> 11:57.400
holding a town hall meeting

11:57.467 --> 11:59.333
to address the community's concerns

11:59.400 --> 12:01.133
about their disastrous oil spills.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.633
And right away, people were interested.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.733
You can see light snacks
and beverages will be provided.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.067
Do you like snacks?

12:08.133 --> 12:09.133
Okay, great.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.800
Now all I needed

12:10.867 --> 12:12.667
was someone to speak at the event

12:12.733 --> 12:14.933
who the public would buy
as a real Shell representative.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.067
And who better to play the part

12:17.133 --> 12:20.233
than someone who actually
believed they worked for Shell?

12:20.300 --> 12:22.633
So I put a job posting on Monster.com

12:22.700 --> 12:24.300
advertising
a short-term position at Shell

12:24.367 --> 12:28.267
in their public relations department.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.533
Once I got a response,
I told the applicant

12:29.600 --> 12:31.300
to meet me on the street corner

12:31.367 --> 12:33.133
outside of Shell's corporate
headquarters

12:33.200 --> 12:34.900
in Carson, California,

12:34.967 --> 12:36.633
where I was waiting to intercept him,

12:36.700 --> 12:38.467
dressed as a Shell employee.

12:38.533 --> 12:40.100
So we're doing some
construction in the building,

12:40.167 --> 12:41.633
so the interview's actually
gonna take place

12:41.700 --> 12:43.933
on our South campus.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.767
Okay, so just hop in,
and I'll take you over.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.767
Then, I drove him around the corner

12:47.833 --> 12:51.533
to a portable I had installed
in a parking lot nearby.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.867
I told him I was
the Shell Vice President

12:53.933 --> 12:55.767
and that the cameras
were documenting us

12:55.833 --> 12:57.533
because, if he got the job,

12:57.600 --> 12:59.300
he would be
Shell's one millionth employee.

12:59.367 --> 13:02.167
So a big part of working in PR at Shell

13:02.233 --> 13:05.633
is dealing with oil spills,
and we have a lot of them.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.733
- Okay.
- And obviously, no one likes it

13:07.800 --> 13:10.267
when an oil spill happens,
but what most people don't get

13:10.333 --> 13:13.267
is that it's a necessary
and unavoidable part

13:13.333 --> 13:16.867
of doing business.
Yes, I get that totally.

13:16.933 --> 13:19.833
Victor was perfectly suited
to being a Shell employee,

13:19.900 --> 13:21.933
and he performed
extremely well under pressure.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.733
How do you feel when you see

13:23.800 --> 13:25.967
this image of a bird covered in oil?

13:27.333 --> 13:29.061
I feel okay.

13:29.067 --> 13:31.800
I feel all right. I don't feel nothing.

13:31.867 --> 13:33.400
No? That's a good answer.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.067
It looks like a fun day at the beach.

13:35.133 --> 13:36.733
So I offered him the job.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.800
Victor didn't know it,

13:38.867 --> 13:41.067
but his only real purpose
was to help me frame Shell

13:41.133 --> 13:43.400
for the theft of
The Banzai Predicament's music.

13:43.467 --> 13:45.333
So on the day of the town hall event,

13:45.400 --> 13:48.333
I set up in the Tracy Legion Hall,

13:48.400 --> 13:49.700
and before long,
concerned Tracy residents

13:49.767 --> 13:51.833
began to fill the room.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.667
So I checked in with Victor outside

13:53.733 --> 13:55.600
to be sure he was
ready to face the crowd.

13:55.667 --> 13:58.333
I mean, there's been two oil
spills in the past two years,

13:58.400 --> 14:00.733
so I'm sure the town
is a little nervous.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.067
- I'll make you proud.
- Okay.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.867
- I'll take care of everything.
- So with Victor prepared,

14:05.933 --> 14:08.367
he headed inside
to address the local community.

14:10.033 --> 14:11.166
I also want to point out

14:12.062 --> 14:13.400
that this spill right here,

14:13.449 --> 14:15.532
this spill was, like, relatively small.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.200
If you had to have a spill somewhere,

14:18.267 --> 14:20.867
you would want this spill
right here in your town.

14:20.933 --> 14:25.333
I know it's kind of hard for
you to grasp, but it's great.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.400
Yes, sir?

14:27.467 --> 14:29.200
The contaminated soil,
where did you dump that?

14:29.267 --> 14:31.067
From the spill site?

14:31.133 --> 14:34.067
Okay. Thank you, sir,
that was a great question.

14:34.133 --> 14:36.600
The information that I had
made available to me is that

14:36.667 --> 14:40.733
we dumped it in a country far,
far away from here.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.467
Victor did a pretty good job

14:42.533 --> 14:44.633
of answering the community's questions.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.200
And I'd like to conclude now,

14:46.267 --> 14:47.967
by showing you guys a short video.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.633
Thank you. But the only thing

14:49.700 --> 14:51.400
that really mattered for my plan

14:51.467 --> 14:53.467
was a fake Shell commercial I had made

14:53.533 --> 14:55.800
using "Orphaned Skies"
as its soundtrack.

14:55.867 --> 15:01.067
♪ It's time to revolutionize ♪

15:01.100 --> 15:04.067
♪ We're bringing on
those orphaned skies ♪

15:04.133 --> 15:07.133
♪ I-ies ♪

15:07.200 --> 15:10.061
Great, right? Good.

15:10.067 --> 15:13.067
I now had evidence of Shell
stealing the band's song.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.600
You guys have a great evening.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.067
and I'll see you at the pump.

15:16.133 --> 15:17.900
So I anonymously uploaded

15:17.967 --> 15:19.667
my cell phone footage to Youtube,

15:19.733 --> 15:21.833
and then I met up with Jani

15:21.900 --> 15:24.133
in the hopes it would make him
angry enough to fight back.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.067
Did they just take it,
or how did that happen?

15:27.100 --> 15:29.167
I guess they just took it.

15:29.233 --> 15:32.167
I... I don't know,
that's not what I envisioned,

15:32.233 --> 15:35.200
like, the song,
its purpose, you know, being.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.333
If it pisses you off, it pisses me off,

15:37.400 --> 15:39.133
you know what I mean?

15:40.267 --> 15:42.833
That's up, that's like plagiarism.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.900
I really admired Jani,

15:44.967 --> 15:47.367
so it was hard
for me to see him so upset.

15:47.433 --> 15:51.800
I guess artists must just
feel more than the rest of us.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.167
Regardless, I had to move forward.

15:54.233 --> 15:57.333
So I pitched him the idea
of doing a protest performance

15:57.400 --> 15:59.200
in front of a busy Shell gas station

15:59.267 --> 16:03.267
so the whole world could
become aware of this injustice.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.333
No, yeah, definitely.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.433
I think it's a good plan, if we
get it, like, well organized.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.933
And the next day, after
showing the rest of the band

16:09.067 --> 16:10.900
what Shell had done,

16:10.967 --> 16:13.533
it was up to Jani to get
them on board with our plan.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.533
It actually really upsets me

16:15.600 --> 16:17.733
that they would do something like that.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.200
If they're putting our names
on it, then they have to pay us.

16:21.267 --> 16:23.900
I mean personally, I agree with Jani.

16:23.967 --> 16:27.061
I think we gotta do something.

16:27.067 --> 16:30.100
I think we should play.

16:30.167 --> 16:33.600
With the band on board
for our protest performance,

16:33.667 --> 16:36.061
we began preparations for the
showdown with Shell

16:36.067 --> 16:38.733
that would hopefully bring
the blues smoke detector

16:38.800 --> 16:40.667
into the spotlight.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.767
To maximize our chances
of getting media attention,

16:43.833 --> 16:46.333
I had a custom stage hitched
to the back of a tanker truck

16:46.400 --> 16:48.633
filled with gasoline
so the band could give away

16:48.700 --> 16:51.433
free gas throughout their performance,

16:51.500 --> 16:54.067
taking business from the
corporation that took from them.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.600
But the most vital part
of this operation

16:55.667 --> 16:57.882
was the smoke detector,

16:57.937 --> 17:00.300
so before heading out,
I had a quick word with Eddie.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.061
Really show off that baby, okay?

17:02.067 --> 17:03.967
- Okay, no worries.
- Yeah, I want to see

17:04.067 --> 17:06.133
that smoke detector featured.
Yeah, I'll be sure.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.700
Cool. Thanks, man.

17:07.767 --> 17:09.267
Let's do it.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.467
Great.

17:11.532 --> 17:16.267
And with that, our tanker
truck was on the move.

17:16.333 --> 17:18.733
Its destination was a busy
Shell station in Hollywood

17:18.800 --> 17:20.833
in the middle of rush hour traffic

17:20.900 --> 17:25.633
and just a block away from
the KTLA news headquarters.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.867
So once the tanker was in place,

17:27.933 --> 17:29.867
the members of The Banzai
Predicament took the stage

17:29.933 --> 17:33.300
and began to play.

17:35.067 --> 17:37.633
Whooo!

17:37.700 --> 17:40.800
Free gas, brother!

17:40.867 --> 17:43.500
Within minutes, a line of cars

17:43.567 --> 17:46.067
- began to form around the block.
- Want a little bit of gas?

17:46.100 --> 17:47.833
And it wasn't long before
the news showed up

17:47.900 --> 17:51.267
to give us the coverage we needed.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.300
All right, the L.A.-based rock band

17:53.367 --> 17:57.333
Banzai Predicament protested
the petroleum giant Shell today

17:57.400 --> 18:00.200
by giving away
a tanker full of gasoline.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.367
The Banzai Predicament band
brought in a filled gas tanker

18:07.433 --> 18:09.800
and began dishing out
free gas to customers

18:09.867 --> 18:11.433
at the Shell gas station

18:11.500 --> 18:13.400
at Sunset Boulevard and Wilton Place

18:13.467 --> 18:16.467
in protest, they say, of
the company's recent oil spills

18:16.533 --> 18:18.667
and the use of their music.

18:18.733 --> 18:21.533
They stole one of our songs
and used it in a commercial,

18:21.600 --> 18:25.061
and so we're out here
giving away free gas.

18:25.067 --> 18:27.133
Free fuel goes a long way

18:27.200 --> 18:30.233
with customers
thankful to not have to pay.

18:30.300 --> 18:33.067
I'm gonna get my free gas,
and I will protest too.

18:33.133 --> 18:35.061
I'll bet you they'll
get a lot of downloads today.

18:35.067 --> 18:36.133
No doubt about that.

18:38.766 --> 18:40.422
Now that the blues smoke detector

18:40.453 --> 18:42.020
had been seen by millions

18:42.031 --> 18:43.747
in the hands of a real rock band,

18:43.832 --> 18:46.114
my instrument
had the legitimacy it needed.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.999
So I could finally return
to Byrnes Logistics

18:48.066 --> 18:50.673
to update Christy on what I had done.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.292
- I see he's using it.
- Yeah.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.565
- I do, yeah.
- Pretty good evidence, huh?

18:55.632 --> 18:59.199
Eh... well,
that's for Customs to decide.

18:59.265 --> 19:01.565
Are you impressed?

19:03.199 --> 19:04.632
No, not really. I mean, you know...

19:04.699 --> 19:06.632
What are you talking about?

19:06.699 --> 19:08.151
He picked up a smoke detector,
and he's using it in a band.

19:08.186 --> 19:09.862
- This was on TV.
- Well...

19:10.342 --> 19:13.875
that's not, you know...
You have to wait and see.

19:13.942 --> 19:17.042
After everything I had done,
Christy was still skeptical,

19:17.075 --> 19:18.415
so to prove her wrong,

19:18.454 --> 19:20.500
I packed up a dozen smoke detectors

19:20.626 --> 19:22.493
addressed
to a contact in South America,

19:22.795 --> 19:24.728
noting on the customs form
that we were sending

19:25.342 --> 19:26.875
musical instruments and nothing else.

19:26.942 --> 19:28.842
And a few days later,

19:28.908 --> 19:31.142
I returned to show her
the shipment had arrived.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.342
So the package arrived.

19:33.408 --> 19:34.808
There it is!

19:34.875 --> 19:36.642
And whether she liked it or not,

19:36.708 --> 19:39.075
Christy had to admit
that my plan had worked.

19:39.142 --> 19:42.275
Well, yeah, it's one
small package through FedEx.

19:42.342 --> 19:44.275
They usually get where they're going.

19:44.342 --> 19:47.142
My work with Byrnes Logistics was done,

19:47.208 --> 19:49.642
but there was still one thing
I had to take care of.

19:49.708 --> 19:52.408
Shell saw the protest on the news,

19:52.475 --> 19:55.642
and they feel awful
about what happened.

19:55.708 --> 19:57.808
In pursuing my goal,

19:57.875 --> 19:59.842
I had turned good people
against each other.

20:00.042 --> 20:01.608
The bottom line is, we messed up.

20:01.675 --> 20:03.408
We just wanna make things right,
you know what I mean?

20:03.475 --> 20:06.275
- Right.
- But now it was time

20:06.342 --> 20:08.642
to heal the wounds
and bring them together.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.742
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hello, how you doing?

20:10.808 --> 20:12.942
- Jani.
- My name is Victor Clark.

20:13.008 --> 20:14.675
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm from corporate Shell.

20:14.742 --> 20:16.308
We made a mistake, you know?

20:16.375 --> 20:18.842
We stole your song,
we're sorry we stole it,

20:18.908 --> 20:21.542
but, you know, how these
things happen, I don't know.

20:21.608 --> 20:24.308
Sometimes we just... usually
we hear what sounds the best,

20:24.375 --> 20:26.408
you know, what sounds
the best for our reasons,

20:26.475 --> 20:28.942
and we stole it, and we'd
like to apologize for that.

20:29.008 --> 20:30.675
Yeah, I don't know.

20:30.742 --> 20:32.808
