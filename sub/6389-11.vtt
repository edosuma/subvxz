Oh, uh, a liaison, perhaps?

12:23.102 --> 12:25.070
Oh, liaison.

12:25.104 --> 12:27.672
I know a cheap little motel close by.

12:27.707 --> 12:30.875
- Really? What would you do?
- Do?

12:30.910 --> 12:32.877
- To me in a cheap hotel?
- Oh, oh.

12:32.912 --> 12:35.380
To you, well, you know,
first, I would kiss you.

12:35.414 --> 12:37.716
No kissing. Not hot, not for a liaison.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.784
No kissing. Okay.

fondle your boobs...

maybe get a sense of your ass, you know?

12:49.962 --> 12:53.698

would make an appearance.

12:53.766 --> 12:55.300
- Ta-da.
- [Both laugh]

12:55.334 --> 12:56.868
Yeah? I would put it in your mouth.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.436
And then I might take it out again.

12:58.471 --> 13:00.171
Maybe I would slap you
on the forehead with it,

13:00.206 --> 13:02.240
just a little bit, you know, just for fun.

13:02.274 --> 13:03.642

and stuff 'em in your mouth.

13:12.485 --> 13:14.052
Nice.

cord around your neck.

far longer, far longer.

I guess you're right.

21:55.274 --> 21:58.509
Ladies, I'm right here.

21:58.544 --> 22:02.513
Yes, I impregnated Julia
just before I met your mom.

22:02.548 --> 22:04.682
Who you then quickly impregnated.

22:04.716 --> 22:06.317
What a fucking baller, huh?

22:06.351 --> 22:08.452
Honey, don't talk like that.

22:08.487 --> 22:10.488
Sorry, just... just
trying to keep it light.

22:10.522 --> 22:12.023
My b, my b.

22:12.057 --> 22:14.025
Honey, I know this is a really shitty way

22:14.059 --> 22:15.626
to find out about something so huge,

22:15.661 --> 22:17.195
and I'm sorry.

22:17.229 --> 22:19.297
I don't know, given the story of my life,

22:19.331 --> 22:21.999
this seems perfectly appropriate.

22:22.034 --> 22:23.701
Yeah.

22:23.735 --> 22:27.605
So where... where do
we go from here, Becca?

22:27.639 --> 22:30.141
What do you mean?

22:30.175 --> 22:31.709
What do you mean, what do I mean?

22:31.743 --> 22:34.278
I have a fucking sister. How cool is that?

22:34.313 --> 22:36.314
You have a fucking
brother. How cool is that?

22:36.348 --> 22:38.849
I don't know yet.

22:38.884 --> 22:40.851
You're sarcastic, just like dad.

22:40.886 --> 22:42.954
I love it, I wanna fucking
party with you, kid.

22:42.988 --> 22:45.223
Can you not call him that?

22:45.257 --> 22:47.625
But he's my father.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.794
<i>He's my father.</i>

22:49.828 --> 22:53.097
Okay, so he's our father.
Deal with it, Becca.

22:53.131 --> 22:54.732
Hey, stop being such a dick.

22:54.766 --> 22:56.601
She's just absorbing the
information right now.

22:56.635 --> 22:58.369
I knew you were gonna take her side.

22:58.403 --> 23:00.605
- I am not siding with anyone.
- That's all right.

23:00.672 --> 23:02.139
You love her more, don't you?

23:02.174 --> 23:03.507
Why wouldn't you? She's your real kid.

23:03.542 --> 23:05.309
That's your real family.

23:05.344 --> 23:07.812
We're just the dirty
one-night stand of families.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.513
I'm a retard, and my mom's a slut.

23:09.548 --> 23:12.049
Honey, don't talk like
that. Behave yourself.

23:12.084 --> 23:13.985
Look, he's just... I'm
sorry, he's emotional.

23:14.019 --> 23:15.486
Hey, hey... will you four

23:15.520 --> 23:17.822
please excuse me while I go hang myself?

23:17.856 --> 23:20.291
No. You don't get to do that.

23:20.325 --> 23:23.427
You don't get to feel sorry for yourself.

23:23.462 --> 23:25.263
- Not even a little bit?
- No, this is your life.

23:25.297 --> 23:26.731
- Deal with it.
- Yeah.

23:26.765 --> 23:28.833
This is your life, Hank
Moody. Deal with it.

23:28.867 --> 23:31.802
<i>I am dealing with it.</i>

23:33.038 --> 23:34.171
How was your trip, honey?

23:34.206 --> 23:36.974
It was amazing, actually.

23:37.009 --> 23:38.409
That's fantastic.

23:38.443 --> 23:41.512
How was...

23:41.546 --> 23:44.048
Now is not the time to be a dick, dad.

23:44.082 --> 23:46.117
[Laughs] Up high, sis.

23:50.222 --> 23:52.023
You're a little uptight.
Anyone ever tell you that?

23:52.057 --> 23:54.025
I'm not... I'm not... I'm not being a dick.

23:54.059 --> 23:57.461
I... I... seriously, I... I don't
remember the gentleman's name.

23:57.496 --> 23:59.830
- Ross.
- Roscoe.

23:59.865 --> 24:02.133
Yeah, Roscoe. Good ol' Roscoe.

24:02.167 --> 24:03.200
Did he behave himself? Did Roscoe...

24:03.235 --> 24:04.669
Tread carefully, Hank.

24:04.703 --> 24:05.870
Why? What? I don't... I don't get it.

24:05.904 --> 24:07.471
Becca has news.

24:07.506 --> 24:09.607
Yes, she said that
earlier, that she had news.

24:09.641 --> 24:11.776
Now's not the time, mom.

24:11.810 --> 24:13.377
You're right. I'm sorry.

24:13.412 --> 24:14.545
No, no, no, now is the time.

24:14.579 --> 24:17.748
I just came clean. Your turn.

24:21.353 --> 24:23.554
- I'm getting married.
- Wow.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.189
- Congratulations.
- Uh, no, you're not.

24:25.223 --> 24:28.659
- I am, dad.
- No, you're not.

24:28.694 --> 24:31.529
Yeah, well, there's not a lot
you can do about it, is there?

24:31.563 --> 24:32.963
Besides, don't you have your hands full

24:32.998 --> 24:34.765
at the moment, juggling your two families?

24:34.800 --> 24:36.567
Becca, this is ridiculous.

24:36.601 --> 24:39.503
- Any more than this?
- I love weddings.

24:39.538 --> 24:44.175
I mean, brother of the
bride. Are you kidding me?

24:44.209 --> 24:46.143
I'm invited, right?
'Cause I'll totally come.

24:46.178 --> 24:47.478
Honey, I think we should go.

24:47.512 --> 24:49.413
What about pizza and movie night?

24:49.448 --> 24:51.382
- Do it another time.
- Don't bother.

24:51.416 --> 24:52.917
- I wanna go home...
- Okay, sweetie.

24:52.951 --> 24:56.187
Wherever the fuck that is these days.

Where the fuck do I begin?

25:25.817 --> 25:27.585
I'm not mad about Levon.

25:27.619 --> 25:31.122
It's kinda nice not being
the only child anymore.

25:31.156 --> 25:33.090
I look forward to getting to know him,

25:33.125 --> 25:34.592
sort of.

25:34.626 --> 25:38.429
He seems... amusing.

25:38.463 --> 25:40.765
He is. He's a good kid.

25:40.799 --> 25:42.400
That's very mature of
you to acknowledge that,

25:42.434 --> 25:43.901
but that's not surprising.

25:43.935 --> 25:46.570
You were always the
mature one in the family.

25:46.605 --> 25:48.906
Ain't that the truth.

25:48.940 --> 25:51.442
Yeah.

25:51.476 --> 25:54.412
So what's all this about
you getting married?

25:54.446 --> 25:57.748
Just that. I'm getting married.

25:57.783 --> 25:58.983
I know you think you're all head over heels

25:59.017 --> 26:00.451
in love with this guy at this point...

26:00.485 --> 26:03.421
Please don't be condescending right now.

26:03.455 --> 26:05.756
In exchange, I promise
not to be condescending

26:05.791 --> 26:09.326
about your latest in a long
line of chronic fuck-ups.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.095
Deal?

26:11.129 --> 26:15.232
My chronic fuck-ups aside,
this is not a good idea, Becca.

26:15.267 --> 26:17.635
- Why?
- 'Cause you're so young.

26:17.669 --> 26:21.305
I'm young, and you're old...

26:21.339 --> 26:22.907
Er.

26:22.941 --> 26:24.308
Thank you.

26:24.342 --> 26:26.544
What's your point?

26:26.578 --> 26:28.078
Looking back, can you honestly say

26:28.113 --> 26:30.548
that you're happy you never got married?

26:30.582 --> 26:31.682
Didn't it basically doom you

26:31.716 --> 26:33.117
to a lifetime of loneliness?

26:33.151 --> 26:34.819
It's not about being married

26:34.853 --> 26:36.487
or not being married, Becca.

26:36.521 --> 26:37.655
- What's it about then?
- [Sighs]

26:37.689 --> 26:39.990
I don't know.

26:40.025 --> 26:42.793
Honestly, I couldn't tell you right now.

26:42.828 --> 26:45.763
But what are the odds that
this particular clown...

26:45.797 --> 26:50.034
this particular young gentleman is the one?

26:50.068 --> 26:52.102
You're one to talk about odds.

26:52.137 --> 26:53.704
Didn't you get it right the first time?

26:53.738 --> 26:55.639
Isn't that what you're
always bragging about?

26:55.674 --> 26:57.041
What makes you so fucking special?

26:57.075 --> 26:58.175
Why couldn't it happen to me too?

26:58.210 --> 26:59.510
Okay, okay, so why the rush?

26:59.544 --> 27:02.947
Because he asked, and I answered.

27:02.981 --> 27:06.083
And it feels right to
me. I'm trusting my gut.

27:06.117 --> 27:09.119
I would think you of all
people could understand that.

27:11.423 --> 27:15.125
I cannot in good conscience
endorse this shit, Becca.

27:18.063 --> 27:19.530
You've got a lot of fucking nerve, dad,

27:19.564 --> 27:20.865
after all the shit you've asked me

27:20.899 --> 27:23.834
to endorse over the years?

27:23.869 --> 27:25.269
That's fair, fair enough.

27:25.303 --> 27:27.838
I come home with good news, great news,

27:27.873 --> 27:29.039
the biggest news in my life,

27:29.074 --> 27:30.508
and I can't even get it out

27:30.542 --> 27:31.742
before I'm confronted with the wreckage

27:31.776 --> 27:35.546
of your fucking past.

27:39.684 --> 27:42.453
I'm sorry.

27:44.489 --> 27:47.925
I don't...

27:47.959 --> 27:52.496
I don't know what else to say.

27:52.531 --> 27:56.133
Yeah, me too.

27:56.167 --> 27:57.234
We're doing it in New York.

27:57.269 --> 27:58.769
You can be a part of it or not.

27:58.803 --> 28:01.171
Totally up to you.

28:01.206 --> 28:03.741
But it's happening.

28:03.775 --> 28:04.875
And I'm not gonna let you make me

28:04.910 --> 28:07.878
fucking miserable about it.
