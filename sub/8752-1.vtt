WEBVTT

00:11.792 --> 00:13.562
I think they see him.

00:13.563 --> 00:16.502
We have a gremlin crawling
up on the ceilings.

00:16.503 --> 00:19.973
It's kind of like a shadow person.

00:19.974 --> 00:21.681
He's bad.

00:21.682 --> 00:24.681
I see a lot of blood.

00:24.682 --> 00:27.100
I'm not gonna let something
drive us out of our home.

00:27.101 --> 00:30.060
I feel very panicked.

00:30.061 --> 00:33.822
This is a terrible place. I hate it.

00:33.823 --> 00:35.423
It's really bad in here.

00:35.424 --> 00:38.392
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.393 --> 00:40.518
Something is not right.

00:40.519 --> 00:41.720
I see dead people.

00:41.721 --> 00:43.760
This person might have
been a serial killer.

00:43.761 --> 00:45.602
I speak to dead people.

00:45.603 --> 00:47.457
You get those chills.

00:47.458 --> 00:48.955
And they speak to me.

00:48.956 --> 00:51.503
He is darkness. He is evil.

00:51.504 --> 00:54.346
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.347 --> 00:56.234
I think she broke her neck.

00:56.235 --> 00:57.676
I rely on my partner.

00:57.677 --> 01:01.721
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:01.722 --> 01:03.055
Telling me the truth?

01:03.056 --> 01:06.268
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:06.269 --> 01:07.829
I think the Devil is down here.

01:07.830 --> 01:09.469
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.909
Who the hell would do this?

01:10.910 --> 01:13.136
But Steve and I never speak...

01:13.137 --> 01:15.291
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.792
Until the very end.

01:16.793 --> 01:17.929
Who's he looking to kill?

01:17.930 --> 01:19.801
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:19.802 --> 01:22.078
You need to get out of here right now.

01:22.079 --> 01:23.175
Or time to get out.

01:23.176 --> 01:27.016
That was, like, endless darkness.

01:49.244 --> 01:53.232
Amy and I work the same case,
but from two separate angles.

01:53.233 --> 01:58.771
I interview living witnesses and look for
secrets buried deep in the property's past.

01:58.772 --> 02:02.372
While Amy talks to the dead.

02:03.461 --> 02:06.197
I'm in the tiny town of
Cressona, Pennsylvania.

02:06.198 --> 02:09.092
It's a couple hours outside of Philly.

02:09.092 --> 02:11.626
I got a call from a man named Randy.

02:11.627 --> 02:14.722
Randy and his fiancÃ©e
are both Army veterans.

02:14.723 --> 02:17.177
And they both know what it's
like to be in a war zone.

02:17.178 --> 02:20.587
They just never expected to
find one in their own home.

02:20.588 --> 02:25.088
I'm hoping Amy and I can help them out.

02:29.575 --> 02:31.070
Before Amy enters a location,

02:31.071 --> 02:36.603
I need to remove anything that
could influence her findings.

02:36.604 --> 02:41.236
This house is filled with family
photographs and military memorabilia.

02:41.237 --> 02:46.757
So I need to conceal all
of it before tonight's walk.

03:01.931 --> 03:06.491
There's this really
tall, really skinny...

03:06.746 --> 03:08.846
Weird...

03:08.984 --> 03:10.817
Crazy...

03:10.818 --> 03:12.075
Guy.

03:12.076 --> 03:14.993
He has, like, a long cape.

03:14.994 --> 03:17.334
And a hat.

03:20.545 --> 03:25.061
He is very excited for
us to be here tonight.

03:25.062 --> 03:27.075
Because he...

03:27.076 --> 03:29.790
Thinks he's all that as far as...

03:29.791 --> 03:34.711
Being able to mess with
people and scare them.

03:36.788 --> 03:39.294
He said, I'll see you
soon. I can't wait.

03:39.295 --> 03:41.862
Like, you'll know when
you get there. Uh...

03:41.863 --> 03:45.583
You know, what I'm all about.

03:59.758 --> 04:03.503
Now, Randy, I understand you and
your fiancÃ©e, Angela, have got

04:03.504 --> 04:06.126
some pretty serious things going
on here for you to call us in.

04:06.127 --> 04:08.596
- Yes.
- Give me an idea what's going on.

04:08.597 --> 04:11.527
There's apparitions. There's shadows.

04:11.528 --> 04:15.232
There's been things moved from one
area of the house to a completely

04:15.233 --> 04:18.434
different area of the house
that I know nobody has touched.

04:18.435 --> 04:20.569
Now, is everybody in the
house being affected by this?

04:20.570 --> 04:22.745
- Yes.
- Who lives in the house?

04:22.746 --> 04:26.495
Myself, Angela, my two
daughters... 8 and 11...

04:26.496 --> 04:28.198
And my stepson, who's 9.

04:28.199 --> 04:31.482
- Are they frightened to be in the house?
- Samantha is.

04:31.483 --> 04:34.802
Samantha actually lived here with me last
year for the school year and moved out

04:34.803 --> 04:37.359
because now she's so afraid,
she doesn't want to move back.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.196
- That's got to be heartbreaking for you.
- It is. It is.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.064
That's my little girl.

04:43.065 --> 04:46.137
It's hard to be a father and protect
your children when you can't...

04:46.138 --> 04:49.137
How do you protect them
against something like that?

04:49.138 --> 04:50.905
Do you guys ever consider
moving out of here?

04:50.906 --> 04:52.106
It's not an option.

04:52.107 --> 04:54.450
Monetarily, we couldn't afford to move.

04:54.451 --> 04:57.058
Secondly, this is the best
school district in the area,

04:57.059 --> 04:59.661
and we want our children to grow
up in a secure, safe environment.

04:59.662 --> 05:01.501
- Okay.
- And this is it.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.468
Okay, do you know
anything about the house?

05:03.469 --> 05:07.619
A little. I know that
the houses were built for

05:07.620 --> 05:10.498
the employees of the rail road
by the owner of the rail road.

05:10.499 --> 05:12.263
Now, are there any parts
of the house you can

05:12.264 --> 05:14.566
show me where you've
experienced or seen things?

05:14.567 --> 05:17.599
Actually, there is.
This area right here.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.476
- You've seen stuff here?
- I have.

05:19.477 --> 05:20.769
What did you see?

05:20.770 --> 05:23.905
It's kind of like a shadow person.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.841
Okay, so how often do you see it?

05:25.842 --> 05:29.277
- A few times a night.
- A few times a night?

05:29.278 --> 05:34.216
Could it be lights coming in from
outside or some kind of reflection issue?

05:34.217 --> 05:38.897
No. Not in that
direction. It couldn't be.

05:39.621 --> 05:43.191
Do you know if this tall guy
interacts with the living here?

05:43.192 --> 05:45.126
Yes, he does.

05:45.127 --> 05:48.247
I think they see him.

05:50.531 --> 05:54.690
He makes them scared, he stares at them.

05:54.691 --> 05:57.605
Is there any particular
reason that he does this?

05:57.606 --> 05:59.886
He's bad.

06:05.628 --> 06:07.548
Okay, Randy, so what's going on in here?

06:07.549 --> 06:11.347
I'll get migraines for a whole day, and
I've never, ever had headaches before.

06:11.348 --> 06:16.123
One evening, I had a headache so
badly that I couldn't even walk.

06:16.124 --> 06:20.136
And that was followed by a tightness...

06:20.137 --> 06:22.743
Almost like a constricting of
my chest like I couldn't breathe.

06:22.744 --> 06:25.934
I had to leave the area, and once I
left the area, it started to dissipate.

06:25.935 --> 06:29.975
- You think you were having a heart attack?
- Honestly, yes, I did at first.

06:29.976 --> 06:35.876
It feels almost as if something is sitting
on you, at the same time, squeezing you.

06:36.082 --> 06:38.002
Okay.

06:40.748 --> 06:46.648
Like, it hurts, and I can't
breathe because of the pressure.

06:46.654 --> 06:50.224
This is the tall, creepy guy.

06:50.225 --> 06:55.095
And he's like, I'm gonna suck
the [Bleep] life out of you.

06:55.096 --> 06:57.431
He doesn't want me to
get anything about him.

06:57.432 --> 07:00.201
He's getting really mad.

07:00.202 --> 07:05.874
Ah, and he's really loud, too,
and he's like blowing in my ear.

07:05.875 --> 07:08.935
The people feel that.

07:10.946 --> 07:13.255
He said, oh, yeah, I
thought you could handle me.

07:13.256 --> 07:16.736
And I said, I can [Bleep].

07:17.151 --> 07:20.187
Randy, you got a lot going
on that you're experiencing.

07:20.188 --> 07:21.963
I mean, is there anything else?

07:21.964 --> 07:23.677
Sounds like there's
things up in the attic.

07:23.678 --> 07:27.386
There's loud bumps,
bangs, noises in the attic.

07:27.387 --> 07:29.775
It's just a really weird, eerie feeling

07:29.776 --> 07:32.601
like you're constantly
being followed or watched.

07:32.602 --> 07:36.202
In fact, I make sure I take my steps very
carefully when I go up and down the steps

07:36.203 --> 07:38.973
because I feel like something
will push me down the steps.

07:38.974 --> 07:41.302
You know, Randy, I got
to ask you. I mean...

07:41.303 --> 07:47.114
Stuff you've told me so far, I don't think
I would stay here, to be honest with you.

07:47.115 --> 07:50.153
- I don't know. How are you doing it?
- Because this is our children's home.

07:50.154 --> 07:52.237
I'm not gonna let something
drive us out of our home.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.879
This is the home that
we've always wanted.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.158
Has this taken a strain
on your personal life?

07:56.159 --> 07:57.885
Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir.

07:57.886 --> 08:00.752
We've been getting
further and further apart.

08:00.753 --> 08:04.248
- Really?
- Yeah. She's my soul mate.

08:04.249 --> 08:07.168
I've always believed for the last
20-something years she's my soul mate.

08:07.169 --> 08:09.370
Okay. Do you think it's
because of the house?

08:09.371 --> 08:10.805
I believe so.

08:10.806 --> 08:15.666
I truly believe it has
a lot to do with it.

08:22.837 --> 08:26.137
These stairs are so bad.

08:31.133 --> 08:34.629
- Why?
- They are an issue.

08:34.630 --> 08:36.398
They're a [Bleep] problem.

08:36.399 --> 08:40.988
- What happens?
- I think they fall down them.

08:40.989 --> 08:46.889
I got to say this is up there
with my top 10 of hatred places.

08:47.409 --> 08:50.447
I feel panicked, confused...

08:50.448 --> 08:53.328
Scared, overwhelmed.

08:53.861 --> 08:56.253
It's a terrible,
terrible, terrible place.

08:56.254 --> 08:58.594
I hate it.

09:03.927 --> 09:07.119
- This is your youngest daughter's?
- Yes, this is the 8-year-old's room.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.512
Okay, what's going on in here?

09:08.513 --> 09:14.413
She had described to me a large, dark
figure with a cape and a hook hand.

09:14.877 --> 09:17.317
That's scary for anybody,
let alone an 8-year-old.

09:17.318 --> 09:19.975
The way I understand it,
she sees it pretty often.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.632
Okay, anything else in this room?

09:21.633 --> 09:25.180
She's deathly afraid of the closet.
She had me draw crosses on her closets.

09:25.181 --> 09:27.916
All right, so what is she
afraid of about the closet?

09:27.917 --> 09:30.471
She never went into detail. She
just doesn't like the closets.

09:30.472 --> 09:32.254
She won't even go in
the closet by herself.

09:32.255 --> 09:34.290
How do you protect somebody like that?

09:34.291 --> 09:37.822
I'm supposed to be the protective
figure. That's my role as a father.

09:37.823 --> 09:40.722
I don't even know the kid, and
my heart's breaking for her.

09:40.723 --> 09:46.483
If I think about it, I get
emotional. That's my daughter.

09:49.505 --> 09:53.776
You can feel the fear
that these people feel.

09:53.777 --> 09:56.837
He likes the closets.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.182
It doesn't really care for children.

10:00.183 --> 10:03.063
They're easy mark.

10:03.853 --> 10:07.455
The tall, thin man is making
his presence felt in every room.

10:07.456 --> 10:12.212
He likes to torment adults, but now
I see his real issue is with children.

10:13.662 --> 10:15.397
Why do you say that?

10:15.398 --> 10:20.326
He's like, oh, I'm gonna [Bleep] with your
head if you're gonna [Bleep] with my head.

10:20.327 --> 10:22.171
And what is he doing?

10:22.172 --> 10:25.407
He's just making me dizzy
and feel like I want to vomit.

10:25.408 --> 10:26.742
I want to puke.

10:26.743 --> 10:30.246
I feel like someone's
pushing my throat in...

10:30.247 --> 10:33.382
Just smushing me right here.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.617
Right here.

10:35.618 --> 10:37.119
Like that.

10:37.120 --> 10:40.960
Just smushing it in really hard.

11:02.187 --> 11:05.523
Randy mentioned you guys fight a lot.

11:05.524 --> 11:09.461
But at the same time, he says you're
his soul mate, so what's the story?

11:09.462 --> 11:14.334
I think it's something
in the house trying to...

11:14.335 --> 11:15.944
- Come between you?
- Yeah.

11:15.945 --> 11:18.037
So, what are some of the
things you're experiencing?

11:18.038 --> 11:21.708
Every night, we have a gremlin
crawling up on the ceilings.

11:21.709 --> 11:23.316
- A gremlin?
- Yep.

11:23.317 --> 11:29.217
2 feet tall, dark green with black
scales going down the back of him.

11:29.300 --> 11:32.266
I've heard a lot of bizarre
stories working cases with Amy.

11:32.267 --> 11:34.499
But when a witness tells
me she's seen a gremlin,

11:34.500 --> 11:36.335
I need to know where her head is at.

11:36.336 --> 11:39.925
I got to ask a question you may not
like, but are you on medications?

11:39.926 --> 11:41.726
No.

11:41.728 --> 11:43.396
Anything else going on?

11:43.397 --> 11:48.963
I get the occasional poking in
the back, hair pulling at night.

11:48.964 --> 11:50.870
- Okay.
- And it's not Randy.

11:50.871 --> 11:53.268
No, Randy's downstairs.

11:53.269 --> 11:55.936
- How the hell are you sleeping at night?
- I don't sleep.

11:55.937 --> 11:59.243
I have a reoccurring nightmare.

11:59.244 --> 12:01.807
I'm laying in bed, and...

12:01.808 --> 12:07.227
the Devil comes up and puts his arms around
me and is pulling me through the bed,

12:07.228 --> 12:10.226
through the first floor, and
once we hit the basement...

12:10.227 --> 12:13.507
He turns around and he
says, I finally got you.

12:13.508 --> 12:16.394
By then, I'm usually screaming,
and Randy wakes me up.

12:16.395 --> 12:18.255
Wow.

12:22.434 --> 12:25.254
I see this woman.

12:25.348 --> 12:28.348
And she's screaming.

12:30.043 --> 12:32.863
And I'm seeing...

12:32.997 --> 12:34.755
The tall, creepy guy.

12:34.756 --> 12:37.415
But his face is always changing.

12:37.416 --> 12:40.401
This tall, creepy guy is
able to read people's minds

12:40.402 --> 12:43.036
and project back their
most horrible fears.

12:43.037 --> 12:47.238
He's very advanced and has
mastered his physical environment.

12:47.239 --> 12:52.880
I think they feel like he might be poking
them, but he's actually grabbing them.

12:52.881 --> 12:56.311
He makes them have nightmares.

12:56.312 --> 12:59.072
Bad... he's bad.

13:06.276 --> 13:09.186
You all right? I saw you grab
your rosary beads on the way down.

13:09.187 --> 13:11.039
What are you feeling
when you come down here?

13:11.040 --> 13:14.463
I just get the overwhelming feeling
like you don't belong down here.

13:14.464 --> 13:16.398
I just feel evil.

13:16.399 --> 13:19.628
Look, I understand you having that
dream makes you not want to come into the

13:19.629 --> 13:23.241
basement, but is there anything else down
here that wants you to keep out of here?

13:23.242 --> 13:27.589
Yes, one night, I was
home alone, and um...

13:27.590 --> 13:32.757
I heard banging and growling and
scratching coming from the basement door.

13:32.758 --> 13:35.050
I grabbed my rosaries,
I put them on the door,

13:35.051 --> 13:37.235
and I went out and I sat
outside waiting for Randy.

13:37.236 --> 13:40.372
Could it have been an animal that got
into the house and was trying to get out?

13:40.373 --> 13:41.531
No.

13:41.532 --> 13:44.944
The back doors... both sets of back
doors were locked from the inside.

13:44.945 --> 13:48.763
And once you go down into the
basement, my rosaries were gone.

13:48.764 --> 13:49.617
Really?

13:49.618 --> 13:54.135
I found them a week later, and
they were broken in the closet.

13:54.136 --> 13:55.733
I almost had a heart attack.

13:55.734 --> 13:57.156
And what do you think's down here?

13:57.157 --> 14:00.997
I think the Devil is down here.

14:09.598 --> 14:13.402
There's, like, this old woman,
and she's, like, crying and...

14:13.403 --> 14:16.365
Oh, no, no, and so sad.

14:16.366 --> 14:22.246
She's creepy. Like, she puts
her hand on me and it's ice.

14:25.633 --> 14:31.043
She knows this house, and this
house is full of people who...

14:31.044 --> 14:35.544
Are really running
away from their lives.

14:41.359 --> 14:44.830
There is something else I
wanted to explain to you.

14:44.831 --> 14:49.234
One of the things that I
feel may be behind it all...

14:49.235 --> 14:51.073
Is my mother.

14:51.074 --> 14:53.862
- My mother passed away in '98.
- What did she die of?

14:53.863 --> 14:55.773
She died of bone-marrow cancer.

14:55.774 --> 14:58.517
- She was 36.
- She was 36?

14:58.518 --> 15:01.846
I had some issues with my mother.

15:01.847 --> 15:04.579
We'd try to make amends,
but it didn't happen.

15:04.580 --> 15:06.941
I feel tremendous guilt.

15:06.942 --> 15:10.320
I absolutely understand
what you're talking about.

15:10.321 --> 15:12.457
Same thing happened
to me with my father.

15:12.458 --> 15:18.358
I didn't get to say goodbye. We
had an argument the night he died.

15:20.129 --> 15:25.325
That was 33 years ago, and
I still have guilt about it.

15:25.326 --> 15:27.906
And if I can do that night over...

15:27.907 --> 15:30.985
I'd do that night over in a minute.

15:30.986 --> 15:35.992
Unfortunately, before she died, we never
had a chance to say goodbye to each other.

15:35.993 --> 15:40.433
So I do believe that my mother is here.

15:47.056 --> 15:50.513
I want to say that this
old lady is somehow...

15:50.514 --> 15:55.225
Related to the house or related
to the people in the house now.

15:55.226 --> 15:59.013
She keeps saying that
she's very sorry...

15:59.014 --> 16:01.865
About everything that's happened.

16:01.866 --> 16:05.526
Somehow, she feels responsible.

16:05.698 --> 16:09.405
I think she knew someone bad... a male.

16:09.406 --> 16:15.306
He was trying to hide it... but
she knew she could've stopped...

16:15.768 --> 16:21.348
It from happening, but she
didn't do anything about it.

16:24.887 --> 16:27.287
Oh, my God.

16:27.447 --> 16:29.199
Something about cancer.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.397
I think she died from it.

16:31.398 --> 16:33.166
Do you know when this was?

16:33.167 --> 16:35.447
Late '90s.

16:35.756 --> 16:38.336
I don't know.

16:38.884 --> 16:42.945
She might be death come to this house.

16:42.946 --> 16:46.726
She's coming to take the lady.

16:58.515 --> 17:01.937
Randy mentioned that one man
owned the entire town of Cressona.

17:01.938 --> 17:06.144
That actually sounds like a pretty
good place to start my investigation.

17:06.145 --> 17:08.433
I'm on my way to meet
with a local historian

17:08.434 --> 17:13.834
who says the town's father
left a very mixed legacy.

17:20.838 --> 17:24.263
John Chapman Cresson was
the founder of Cressona.

17:24.265 --> 17:29.392
In 1847, he became the President of the
Mine Hill and Schuylkill Haven Railroad.

17:29.393 --> 17:32.850
Which ran through Cressona.
This is his picture.

17:32.851 --> 17:38.751
His contemporaries describe him as quite
a tall man with very expressive eyes.

17:39.045 --> 17:42.230
Now, Rick, did he get rich just from
being the President of the company?

17:42.231 --> 17:46.774
No, he made the lion's share of his money
through land and property acquisition.

17:46.775 --> 17:49.111
We have a sales agreement here.

17:49.112 --> 17:55.012
Where in 1847, when he became President,
he purchased 200 acres for $9,000.

17:55.406 --> 17:57.774
He was a very shrewd businessman.

17:57.775 --> 18:00.810
And how's it go from
the land into a town?

18:00.811 --> 18:05.499
What John Cresson did is he broke
the land up into individual plots,

18:05.500 --> 18:08.383
and had homes built on the plots.

18:08.384 --> 18:12.088
And then what he did is he sold
them to the rail road workers.

18:12.089 --> 18:14.799
So, on one hand, he was
putting money into their pocket,

18:14.800 --> 18:17.212
and on the other hand, taking it out.

18:17.213 --> 18:20.830
So, what wound up happening with this
guy? What, did he stay in the area?

18:20.831 --> 18:24.789
Well, as much as he built up
the economy of Cressona, he also

18:24.790 --> 18:27.493
pretty much ruined it in 1864.

18:27.494 --> 18:30.930
What he did was he leased the
rail line to the Reading Railroad.

18:30.931 --> 18:35.784
And by doing that, it outsourced a
lot of the employees from Cressona,

18:35.785 --> 18:38.194
and the jobs weren't
here as much anymore.

18:38.195 --> 18:41.645
So, during all this recession time,
he's still making a lot of cash.

18:41.646 --> 18:43.103
Yes, he is.

18:43.104 --> 18:45.522
So, it sounds like this
guy's kind of ruthless.

18:45.523 --> 18:50.383
He was. He was a true
capitalist of the day.

18:52.897 --> 18:57.577
I think that this is
the tall, creepy guy.

18:58.810 --> 19:01.750
He does not want...

19:02.111 --> 19:04.041
Anybody to know who he is.

19:04.042 --> 19:06.990
Do you know how he looked in life?

19:06.991 --> 19:10.512
Well, he was taller than average.

19:10.513 --> 19:15.721
I think he had, like, kind of a
slender face, a kind of a hook nose.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.002
Dark eyes.

19:18.946 --> 19:21.399
He's saying, stop, stop!

19:21.400 --> 19:26.197
Because I'm, like, trying
to get into his head.

19:26.198 --> 19:30.099
Able to get any more
about what he did in life?

19:30.100 --> 19:35.124
I think he sells a variety
of merchandise, I think.

19:35.125 --> 19:36.971
And I know he's bad.

19:36.972 --> 19:41.712
And I know he was a
very, very bad person.

19:44.912 --> 19:48.424
I need to find out everything I
can about my client's property.

19:48.425 --> 19:51.768
So I head to the local library.

19:51.769 --> 19:53.040
Digging through the archives,

19:53.041 --> 19:58.358
I discover a deadly rail road crash in
1892 involving a man named John Gray.

19:58.359 --> 20:03.339
Turns out he used to
live in my clients' home.

20:06.053 --> 20:08.593
So, I've reached out to
a local train historian,

20:08.594 --> 20:13.754
who tells me this tragedy
could've been prevented.

20:19.246 --> 20:21.697
Now, Dale, you mentioned
that this guy John Gray was in

20:21.698 --> 20:24.135
the middle of this train
wreck that I had read about.

20:24.136 --> 20:25.394
What did you mean by that?

20:25.395 --> 20:28.938
Well, he was responsible for
maintaining equipment as a Foreman.

20:28.939 --> 20:31.269
And foremen generally
were involved with making

20:31.270 --> 20:33.619
sure locomotives were repaired properly.

20:33.620 --> 20:36.409
Dale, can you explain exactly
how the train wreck went down?

20:36.410 --> 20:39.474
It happened at 2:00 in the
morning on a cold November night.

20:39.475 --> 20:42.270
And this is especially
tragic because the crew

20:42.271 --> 20:45.425
brought this train to
Cressona from Reading.

20:45.426 --> 20:48.877
And another crew had gotten on to
replace them to take the train North,

20:48.878 --> 20:52.071
so instead of having three men
on the locomotive, there were six.

20:52.072 --> 20:55.309
And just two minutes later,
the locomotive exploded

20:55.310 --> 20:58.486
and killed five of them, and the
other man died later in the hospital.

20:58.487 --> 21:01.720
- So, two sets of crews gets killed.
- Correct.

21:01.721 --> 21:05.793
In connection to my clients' property,
how far away from that was the explosion?

21:05.794 --> 21:07.646
Basically, just down the hill.

21:07.647 --> 21:10.064
This is what a boiler
explosion looks like.

21:10.065 --> 21:12.795
That's not that actual locomotive but,

21:12.796 --> 21:16.320
a photograph of a steam locomotive
that had a boiler explosion.

21:16.321 --> 21:18.644
Okay, we don't have any photos
of that explosion itself?

21:18.645 --> 21:19.753
No, we don't.

21:19.754 --> 21:22.017
- Okay, was anybody ever charged?
- No.

21:22.018 --> 21:24.105
So, Dale, I got to assume,
in a small town like this,

21:24.106 --> 21:27.110
this had to be the biggest
accident they ever had.

21:27.111 --> 21:32.268
Well, it was up until that time.
But in 1918, the Spanish Flu hit.

21:32.269 --> 21:38.169
Interestingly, John Gray's son, James,
was a Doctor in the town at that time.

21:40.912 --> 21:45.052
Something doesn't want me back here.

21:46.141 --> 21:49.602
I'm, like, hearing yelling.

21:49.603 --> 21:53.443
I feel panicked... very panicked.

21:53.575 --> 21:57.534
I am seeing, like,
all of these men dying.

21:57.535 --> 22:02.606
I don't know if it's 1870
or something. I don't know.

22:02.607 --> 22:08.104
These men are yelling and screaming and
they're jumping up and falling down...

22:08.105 --> 22:12.468
And there's, like, dust everywhere,
and nobody can see anything.

22:12.469 --> 22:17.226
Like, I'm totally not ready to see
this [Bleep] that's happening around me.

22:17.227 --> 22:20.347
And it makes me sick.

22:36.883 --> 22:39.916
You know, I made some calls,
and Dale's story checked out.

22:39.917 --> 22:42.870
The Spanish Flu devastated Cressona.

22:42.871 --> 22:45.987
So, I'm headed over to see a local
Doctor who says some of those victims

22:45.988 --> 22:51.028
may have died right in
Randy and Angela's home.

22:58.135 --> 23:02.388
Before we get into the Spanish Flu,
can you tell me anything about Dr. Gray?

23:02.389 --> 23:06.472
He was the only Doctor in
Cressona during the Spanish Flu.

23:06.473 --> 23:10.805
And his clinic and his residence
were in the same building.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.521
Okay, so did he practice out
of the house I'm investigating?

23:13.522 --> 23:14.680
Yes.

23:14.681 --> 23:17.349
Okay, so how bad really was it?

23:17.350 --> 23:22.866
The Spanish Flu was about 200 times
as lethal as our typical flu virus.

23:22.867 --> 23:26.471
50 million people died worldwide.

23:26.472 --> 23:27.927
Wow.

23:27.928 --> 23:30.596
That being said, how
bad did Cressona get hit?

23:30.597 --> 23:34.148
Cressona was absolutely
hammered with death.

23:34.149 --> 23:37.021
They normally had about
10 people die each day.

23:37.022 --> 23:38.103
Okay.

23:38.104 --> 23:40.939
But it spiked around
the 20th of October.

23:40.940 --> 23:44.498
There were 30 deaths
in a small community.

23:44.499 --> 23:48.080
The Spanish Flu itself,
how contagious was it?

23:48.081 --> 23:53.981
Nationally, 28% of the U.S. population
came down with the 1918 influenza.

23:54.451 --> 23:57.132
And there were a great
number of people that died

23:57.133 --> 23:59.968
four or five days after
coming down with the illness.

23:59.969 --> 24:01.883
- Wow.
- Yeah.

24:01.884 --> 24:04.764
So, the beginning symptoms,
what would they be like?

24:04.765 --> 24:09.201
Well, initially, you'd develop a headache
and body aches and cold symptoms...

24:09.202 --> 24:11.303
Runny nose, sore throat, coughing.

24:11.304 --> 24:13.239
And how does it progress
to where they die?

24:13.240 --> 24:17.377
Well, in most cases, fatalities
were from bacterial pneumonia.

24:17.378 --> 24:18.645
Okay.

24:18.646 --> 24:22.415
You would feel like your chest
was being compressed or squeezed.

24:22.416 --> 24:25.885
It would be like starvation of air.

24:25.886 --> 24:28.454
Oh, geez. So, basically,
they suffocated to death.

24:28.455 --> 24:31.656
Yeah. It was absolutely scary.

24:31.657 --> 24:33.906
Dr. Gray had to be
overwhelmed by all this.

24:33.907 --> 24:38.674
Yes. They would've been convalescing
in his house and dying there.

24:38.675 --> 24:40.535
Wow.

24:44.502 --> 24:49.422
It's ridiculous how many
dead people are here.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.833
Something happened.

24:57.834 --> 25:01.074
What the [Bleep] is it?

25:04.383 --> 25:07.718
There's, like, illness in here.

25:07.719 --> 25:10.899
Oh, my God, it's bad.

25:11.698 --> 25:15.767
The amount of dead in this location feels
like it's sucking the life out of me.

25:15.768 --> 25:19.838
I've been sick this whole time,
but I can't figure out why.

25:19.839 --> 25:21.999
Oh, God.

25:22.124 --> 25:25.304
I can't breathe again.

25:25.945 --> 25:28.768
I just want to vomit.

25:28.769 --> 25:30.989
I feel...

25:31.096 --> 25:33.796
[Bleep] Terrible.

25:41.326 --> 25:44.697
During my walk, I was harassed
by a tall, thin man in a cape.

25:44.698 --> 25:48.500
So I'm meeting with a sketch artist
to draw him as he appeared in life.

25:48.501 --> 25:52.461
He had a long, thin, pointy nose.

25:54.058 --> 25:58.915
His eyes are rounded on
top, straight at the bottom.

25:58.916 --> 26:00.412
Okay.

26:00.413 --> 26:05.093
His hair came down to
about the collarbone.

26:06.046 --> 26:09.822
Next, I described his favorite
place to torment the living.

26:09.823 --> 26:12.124
There's a closet along the wall.

26:12.125 --> 26:14.951
It needs to be open halfway.

26:14.952 --> 26:16.006
All right.

26:16.007 --> 26:21.167
He's facing the side of
the bed from the closet.

26:26.455 --> 26:29.575
Is that what you saw?

26:30.122 --> 26:31.982
Yes.

26:55.785 --> 26:58.573
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

26:58.574 --> 27:04.474
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.797
Amy, I want you to
meet Angela and Randy.

27:07.798 --> 27:11.553
They live here with Angela's
son and Randy's two daughters.

27:11.554 --> 27:15.424
Now, the thing about this couple, unlike
any other couple we've dealt with...

27:15.425 --> 27:17.728
They're both Army veterans.

27:17.729 --> 27:21.103
And they've been trained to
deal with high-stress situations.

27:21.104 --> 27:24.946
But the activity in
this house is so intense

27:24.947 --> 27:27.528
that it's literally
ripping their family apart.

27:27.529 --> 27:30.736
With that, I'm gonna ask Amy to
tell us a little bit about her walk.

27:30.737 --> 27:34.457
And see what we come up with.

27:37.879 --> 27:42.945
This is seriously one of the
worst places that I've walked.

27:42.946 --> 27:46.141
There were just so
many dead people, and...

27:46.142 --> 27:49.436
They were all trying to talk at once.

27:49.437 --> 27:53.516
I was physically and
emotionally just trashed.

27:53.517 --> 27:57.044
Pretty much every room
upstairs made me sick.

27:57.045 --> 28:01.131
Some of the symptoms I felt that
night was dizziness, vomiting...

28:01.132 --> 28:05.286
Um, and I did, in one room, felt
like somebody was crushing my throat.

28:05.287 --> 28:07.634
Okay, so you were sick
throughout the whole walk?

28:07.635 --> 28:09.126
- Yes.
- With those symptoms?

28:09.127 --> 28:10.907
- Yes.
- That's why you sound sick?

28:10.908 --> 28:14.048
- Yeah. Mm hmm.
- From that? That's interesting.

28:14.049 --> 28:17.341
I might be able to explain
why she probably felt that way.

28:17.342 --> 28:20.820
Back in 1918, the Spanish Flu hit here.

28:20.821 --> 28:24.973
30 people died in one day from
the Spanish Flu in Cressona.

28:24.974 --> 28:28.951
Approximately 20% of the
town died from this flu.

28:28.952 --> 28:32.046
James Gray, the guy that owned
this house and lived here,

28:32.047 --> 28:34.533
happened to be the only Doctor in town.

28:34.534 --> 28:37.939
And he treated a lot of those Spanish
Flu patients right here in this home,

28:37.940 --> 28:39.638
where a lot of them
probably passed away.

28:39.639 --> 28:42.299
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

28:42.300 --> 28:46.355
Can the children get sick because of that
or us get sick because of that or anything?

28:46.356 --> 28:48.236
Have you shown any symptoms?

28:48.237 --> 28:51.373
I went through exactly what you
just described on many occasions.

28:51.374 --> 28:55.106
It's like Steve had mentioned...
it's like a flu-like symptom.

28:55.107 --> 28:58.176
But all of a sudden, I got
a debilitating headache.

28:58.177 --> 28:59.440
I mean, I couldn't even walk.

28:59.441 --> 29:01.430
I crawled to the bathroom

29:01.431 --> 29:04.820
because I felt like I was gonna vomit,
and I was super, super nauseated.

29:04.821 --> 29:07.889
- I couldn't even stand up.
- Yeah, I get sick a lot.

29:07.890 --> 29:09.958
- Same type of feelings?
- Headaches, migraines.

29:09.959 --> 29:12.175
Yeah, that makes sense.

29:12.176 --> 29:14.474
The residual here is very thick.

29:14.475 --> 29:17.715
Like, it hangs on to...

29:18.723 --> 29:21.405
The memories and, you know...

29:21.406 --> 29:25.126
Everything that transpired here.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.568
So, how did the rest of the walk go?

29:31.569 --> 29:33.663
This guy shows up.

29:33.664 --> 29:39.544
He was extremely tall, extremely
thin, had a hat on, cape...

29:39.753 --> 29:41.853
Shadowy.

29:42.138 --> 29:45.816
He's very creepy, very powerful.

29:45.817 --> 29:49.640
I met him when I walked through here.

29:49.641 --> 29:53.834
And he's like, I'm gonna suck
the [Bleep] life out of you.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.536
He doesn't want me to
get anything about him.

29:56.537 --> 29:58.821
He's getting really mad.

29:58.822 --> 30:01.002
He was a businessman.

30:01.003 --> 30:03.896
I know he bought and sold things.

30:03.897 --> 30:08.417
And I know he had a
hook nose and dark eyes.

30:08.418 --> 30:10.546
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:10.547 --> 30:13.062
Well, I mean, it's a long shot.

30:13.063 --> 30:16.499
I mean, but what she's describing
kind of reminds me of somebody

30:16.500 --> 30:18.583
who's kind of actually
pretty important to this town.

30:18.584 --> 30:22.749
Okay, well, it turns out it's a guy named
John Chapman Cresson, hence Cressona.

30:22.750 --> 30:27.080
This guy ran the rail road here, owned
the rail road, and bought the land here...

30:27.081 --> 30:29.619
And basically built the town.

30:29.620 --> 30:32.998
Now, he had some shady dealings.

30:32.999 --> 30:36.123
He built homes for the rail
road workers that he employed.

30:36.124 --> 30:40.059
Okay, now I got a photo of
some of these rail road workers.

30:40.060 --> 30:45.099
It'll give you an idea of
what these guys looked like.

30:45.100 --> 30:50.199
So, what he was doing is he built homes
like this one for his employees to live in.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.079
So, what he did was
he paid them at work...

30:53.080 --> 30:55.208
Then sold them the house,
and they just paid him rent,

30:55.209 --> 30:59.137
so the money that he was
making went right back to him.

30:59.138 --> 31:03.053
Come 1864, he leases his rail
road company out to Reading,

31:03.054 --> 31:06.049
so now all his workers,
they were out of a job.

31:06.050 --> 31:09.637
It basically decimated the town, where they
went into a recession for over 20 years.

31:09.638 --> 31:11.310
- Wow.
- Wow.

31:11.311 --> 31:14.791
If you look at his nose...

31:14.910 --> 31:17.014
He's got this hook nose that she had.

31:17.015 --> 31:19.100
Interesting.

31:19.101 --> 31:25.001
And he was considered tall for
his time, from what I was told.

31:25.806 --> 31:29.216
Do you think that they had the same
characteristics as the guy you ran into?

31:29.217 --> 31:31.283
Definitely.

31:31.284 --> 31:35.064
I did do a sketch of the man.

31:37.988 --> 31:39.848
Wow.

31:40.024 --> 31:43.084
Take a look at that.

31:44.860 --> 31:48.345
Wow, his eyes are pretty close. His
eyes and nose are almost identical.

31:48.346 --> 31:51.046
Identical, right?

31:51.251 --> 31:53.796
Wow, that's freaky. I would
say that's the same guy.

31:53.797 --> 31:55.405
It looks spot on to me.

31:55.406 --> 31:59.579
So, basically, the guy that built
Cressona is hanging out in our house.

31:59.580 --> 32:02.460
- Yes.
- Wonderful.

32:02.903 --> 32:05.715
So, Amy, in your opinion...

32:05.716 --> 32:11.616
Do you think this gentleman is
the evil presence in our house?

32:16.085 --> 32:20.945
I think he's an evil
presence in your house.

32:21.281 --> 32:24.594
He likes to mess with people.

32:24.595 --> 32:29.554
One of the things that he did to me in
here was, like he was standing on my chest.

32:29.555 --> 32:33.662
What I saw was him, like,
pushing down on someone's chest.

32:33.663 --> 32:38.665
When I was in here, I felt,
like, your ear will thump.

32:38.666 --> 32:41.239
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

32:41.240 --> 32:45.560
And he'll try to whisper in your ear.

32:45.625 --> 32:48.105
You'll feel pokes.

32:48.106 --> 32:52.051
I get poked and my hair
pulled almost every night.

32:52.052 --> 32:57.879
He gives people nightmares, and
he also likes to stare people down.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.948
And I have tremendous nightmares.

33:00.949 --> 33:05.089
- Really?
- I am sleeping upstairs...

33:06.004 --> 33:07.949
And...

33:07.950 --> 33:09.870
Um...

33:09.911 --> 33:14.737
I get a set of hands that
come up through the bed.

33:14.738 --> 33:17.047
Pull me all the way down,
and I can feel myself

33:17.048 --> 33:19.404
going through the layers of the house.

33:19.405 --> 33:25.305
And when I get to the basement, he
says, I've got you. I finally got you.

33:25.688 --> 33:28.635
She sees a gremlin-type creature.

33:28.636 --> 33:32.368
He could manipulate how he's perceived.

33:32.369 --> 33:34.237
And it knows what scares you.

33:41.544 --> 33:45.070
The other thing that I got was, uh...

33:45.071 --> 33:47.891
He hates children.

33:47.995 --> 33:49.850
He hates kids.

33:49.851 --> 33:52.747
And then I saw one of
the things he was doing,

33:52.748 --> 33:55.663
which I thought was very disturbing,
and I did sketch it, so...

33:55.664 --> 33:57.622
- You sketched it?
- Yeah, I did.

33:57.623 --> 33:59.751
- Where did you see this?
- This.

33:59.752 --> 34:03.412
Oh, so it's Samantha's room.

34:08.685 --> 34:13.965
I don't even know if I
want to show this to you.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.858
That's the closet.

34:31.552 --> 34:34.312
I want this guy.

34:37.226 --> 34:40.525
I'm gonna get this guy.

35:16.301 --> 35:19.061
I want this guy.

35:22.196 --> 35:24.892
I'm gonna get this guy.

35:42.377 --> 35:44.494
I'm confronting this little bastard.

35:44.495 --> 35:47.603
That John Cresson [Bleep] him and
I are gonna have some dealings.

35:47.604 --> 35:50.944
I'm gonna sit down, and I'm gonna square
off with that son of a [Bleep] on his own.

35:50.945 --> 35:56.225
He wants a piece of
something, come and [Bleep] me.

36:04.190 --> 36:06.223
- You all right?
- Yep.

36:06.224 --> 36:09.253
I know a few people
that won't be, though.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.255
Problem is you're not
dealing with the living here.

36:11.256 --> 36:12.990
I know.

36:12.991 --> 36:15.526
Samantha is deathly
afraid of the closets.

36:15.527 --> 36:19.434
Because of that, she had me draw
crosses on every one of her walls.

36:19.435 --> 36:23.414
And a huge three-foot cross
on the one closet door.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.969
Wow.

36:24.970 --> 36:26.937
Do you have any idea
why he doesn't like kids?

36:26.938 --> 36:28.606
He's just a jerk.

36:28.607 --> 36:31.308
And he's just a coward.

36:31.309 --> 36:32.755
Very much so.

36:32.756 --> 36:36.176
A sick, sick, sick coward.

36:38.348 --> 36:41.885
I hate to even ask this right now,
but was there anything else you saw?

36:41.886 --> 36:43.910
I saw an old lady.

36:43.911 --> 36:49.559
And I got that she might have been
a relative of someone who lives here.

36:49.560 --> 36:53.195
That she died of cancer, and
she died in the late '90s.

36:53.196 --> 36:54.396
Oh!

36:54.397 --> 36:56.797
Oh, my God.

36:57.252 --> 36:59.768
Her mother died of cancer.

36:59.769 --> 37:03.129
I told you she was here.

37:06.775 --> 37:09.311
If it's Angela's Mom,
why would she be here?

37:09.312 --> 37:12.491
She had a lot of
regret. She felt guilty.

37:12.492 --> 37:18.392
And she kept saying that she felt
responsible about everything that happened.

37:18.421 --> 37:20.401
She...

37:20.884 --> 37:23.125
Knew that there was a bad male.

37:23.126 --> 37:27.830
She felt like she could've stopped
it from happening, but she didn't.

37:27.831 --> 37:31.041
My stepfather was a very evil man.

37:31.042 --> 37:35.377
And towards the end, before she
died, I tried to make amends,

37:35.378 --> 37:41.036
and he would not let me speak to
her on the phone or come and see her.

37:41.037 --> 37:44.517
And she died a week later.

37:45.411 --> 37:47.970
She's back to take
the woman of the house.

37:47.971 --> 37:50.903
Death was gonna come to the
house, but she came instead.

37:50.904 --> 37:52.824
Whoa.

37:54.190 --> 37:58.961
When I was leaving, she said, my
job's done. Tell her I'm waiting.

37:58.962 --> 38:00.729
What?

38:00.730 --> 38:04.266
Somebody's coming to kill her?

38:04.267 --> 38:06.067
No.

38:06.369 --> 38:09.872
But someone's coming to
take her when she dies.

38:09.873 --> 38:11.793
Okay.

38:12.783 --> 38:16.512
I mean, for her to take death's
place so that she'll be comfortable.

38:16.513 --> 38:20.413
- So, it's out of love.
- Yeah.

38:20.543 --> 38:24.316
Is her mother really feeling guilty?

38:24.317 --> 38:25.730
Yes.

38:25.731 --> 38:27.990
And you feel guilty, as well.

38:27.991 --> 38:30.526
Why do you feel guilty?

38:30.527 --> 38:32.224
Because I didn't say goodbye.

38:32.225 --> 38:36.633
I didn't get to say that I forgive her.

38:36.634 --> 38:40.774
I knew she'd be there when I died.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.556
Well, listen, it's been a tough night.

38:47.557 --> 38:49.949
And I think you guys got a lot
more than you bargained for.

38:49.950 --> 38:51.489
- For sure.
- Definitely.

38:51.490 --> 38:55.485
But the reason we're here and why
you called us is to see if you...

38:55.486 --> 38:57.363
And your family can live here peacefully

38:57.364 --> 38:59.372
and straighten out what
the hell you got going on.

38:59.373 --> 39:01.157
Yes.

39:01.158 --> 39:02.466
I can't answer that,

39:02.467 --> 39:07.924
but I'm gonna turn it over to my
partner, Amy, and hopefully, she can.

39:07.925 --> 39:12.593
Me, personally, I don't
like this house or this area.

39:12.594 --> 39:17.073
If it's at all within
your means, I would move.

39:17.074 --> 39:18.833
I won't let it beat us.

39:18.834 --> 39:21.911
If we made it this far, we went through
everything we went through so far,

39:21.912 --> 39:25.158
I'm not gonna just roll over and say go
ahead and take it I'm fighting for what's

39:25.159 --> 39:28.399
mine this is our house this is where our
children are gonna grow up this is where

39:28.400 --> 39:32.176
we're gonna be safe whether they like
it or not they're getting the hell out.

39:32.177 --> 39:35.642
You know, monetarily, they can't leave.

39:35.643 --> 39:38.297
It would devastate them, so is
there anything else they can do?

39:38.298 --> 39:40.638
Basically...

39:40.770 --> 39:44.472
Because it seems to be
encompassing the town,

39:44.473 --> 39:47.247
like, you need to build your fortress.

39:47.248 --> 39:52.254
So, the first thing being
for you to get bags of salt.

39:52.255 --> 39:56.755
And go around the
entire property line...

39:57.048 --> 40:00.684
Thick so you see the line on the ground.

40:00.685 --> 40:04.385
When you can do it, I would suggest,

40:04.386 --> 40:07.932
building a fence surrounding
the entire property.

40:07.933 --> 40:12.089
And when you purchase
those building materials.

40:12.090 --> 40:14.097
Have them blessed.

40:14.098 --> 40:16.466
- Wow.
- So, who should do the blessing?

40:16.467 --> 40:18.807
Any real...

40:18.823 --> 40:20.401
Holy person.

40:20.402 --> 40:24.134
Then, with a holy person,
again, of your choice.

40:24.135 --> 40:26.544
They're gonna bless the house.

40:26.545 --> 40:29.443
While this person's
blessing the house...

40:29.444 --> 40:32.924
I want you to take this...

40:33.143 --> 40:36.180
Follow them around, and after
they're done in each room...

40:36.181 --> 40:40.111
Blessing each room...
sprinkle this in the room.

40:40.112 --> 40:41.271
What is this?

40:41.272 --> 40:43.902
This is brimstone.

40:43.903 --> 40:46.397
And it's used in exorcisms.

40:46.398 --> 40:48.055
Oh, my God.

40:48.056 --> 40:49.545
And what will that do?

40:49.546 --> 40:51.663
It'll get rid of the dead people here.

40:51.664 --> 40:54.453
- What about her Mom?
- That woman will stay.

40:54.454 --> 40:56.393
That process cannot stop.

40:56.394 --> 40:58.359
It's natural, organic.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.739
I'm mortified.

41:00.740 --> 41:03.860
I thought there was...

41:03.945 --> 41:07.686
Maybe four things here
and one of them was evil.

41:07.687 --> 41:10.805
But not to this extent.

41:10.806 --> 41:13.452
- Okay.
- We're gonna be fine.

41:13.453 --> 41:15.554
I'm not gonna let nothing
happen to the kids.

41:15.555 --> 41:17.894
Now, I'm gonna ask you, are
you gonna follow Amy's advice?

41:17.895 --> 41:20.059
- Without a doubt.
- Angela?

41:20.060 --> 41:21.269
Yeah.

This is one of those investigations, I got
to tell you, especially because I'm a vet.

41:25.688 --> 41:30.436
The fact that we were able to hopefully
help you here makes me feel good.

41:30.437 --> 41:32.200
I know it makes her feel good.

41:32.201 --> 41:36.743
But from the bottom of my heart, I
really appreciate it from both of you.

41:36.744 --> 41:38.773
- Well, thank you for letting us come in.
- Mm hmm.

41:38.774 --> 41:41.834
Thank you for coming.

41:42.680 --> 41:45.939
I still believe Angela and
Randy would be best off moving.

41:45.940 --> 41:49.777
But since they can't, I really
hope that they follow my advice.

41:49.778 --> 41:55.678
So that their home can be freed of the
dead and their kids will remain safe.
