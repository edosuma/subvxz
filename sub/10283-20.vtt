WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:05.539
Previously on ER:

00:05.539 --> 00:07.341
You sending me
to Africa?
I thought

00:07.341 --> 00:08.676
you could use a change
of perspective.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.611
DEBBIE:
Mouthwash? You gotta
be kidding me.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.080
You're a weird
dude, Pratt.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.649
So Debbie and Dakarai, huh?

00:15.649 --> 00:17.585
Yeah, they're an item.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.587
We're on our way
to the Dumtala camp
to help the sick people.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.122
We are only here to help.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.423
Generally, they do not
hurt the doctors,

00:22.423 --> 00:24.158
but one never knows
what might happen.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.060
( clamoring )

00:26.060 --> 00:28.229
Welcome to Darfur.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:39.740 --> 00:41.242
( trucks rumbling )

00:43.477 --> 00:44.712
( Dakarai speaking Arabic )

00:44.712 --> 00:46.247
PRATT:
Well, we got our problems.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.581
You ever heard of Katrina?

00:47.581 --> 00:51.619
If the US does not lead
the way, who else will?

00:51.619 --> 00:54.788
( Dakarai speaking Arabic )

00:54.788 --> 00:57.691
Huh? Without international
intervention,

00:57.691 --> 01:00.294
nothing will change here.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.796
Ask him if he's been
taking the amoxicillin.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.632
( speaking Arabic )
Listen,

01:04.632 --> 01:07.135
even with intervention,
a year after us being here,

01:07.135 --> 01:09.370
the whole world will be
screaming for us to get
the hell out of Sudan.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.306
Oh... Pratt, I expected
so much more from you. Ahh.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.341
Why? 'Cause I'm black?

01:13.341 --> 01:15.243
No, because you are smart.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.345
Yeah, well,
but I'm also American.
I did not realize

01:17.345 --> 01:18.512
these things
are mutually exclusive.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.581
He says yes,
he's feeling better.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.550
Okay, good.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.652
Listen, all I'm saying is that
it's a lot more complicated

01:24.652 --> 01:26.620
than that.
Too many times

01:26.620 --> 01:28.722
and way too quick getting in the
middle of other people's fights.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.559
Fine. When the solution
does come to Darfur,

01:31.559 --> 01:34.662
it is not going to be quick.
Yeah, well,

01:34.662 --> 01:37.298
where I'm from,
gangs get into it all the time.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.699
Sometimes all the cops can do
is step back

01:38.699 --> 01:39.733
and wait
for it to end.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.369
"Step back and wait."

01:41.369 --> 01:43.271
You know, that sounds like
an excellent foreign policy

01:43.271 --> 01:44.638
where people are sitting
and suffering.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.807
Dakarai, stop ragging
on my country, okay?

01:46.807 --> 01:48.276
There's plenty of Americans
helping out.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.777
You see me here, right?
Yes.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.845
And quite frankly,
I'm beginning to wonder why.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.381
( sighs )

01:53.381 --> 01:54.648
( speaking Arabic )

01:54.648 --> 01:55.816
What?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.885
She says the baby
won't move.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.753
Okay, just show me where.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.323
And you are moving
pretty fast for
an isolationist.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.591
They told you
a brother was coming,

02:03.591 --> 02:04.825
so you were expecting
Marcus Garvey?

02:04.825 --> 02:06.460
Don't think
we have any more

02:06.460 --> 02:08.529
in common than
you and Carter.
I don't.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.898
In fact, I think Carter is more
African than you are.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.603
Ah. Assalamu alaikum.

02:15.603 --> 02:16.770
Alaikum assalamu.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.573
( continues speaking Arabic )

02:21.642 --> 02:23.711
How long has he been like this?

02:23.711 --> 02:26.280
Um...

02:26.280 --> 02:29.517
Has he had fever?
Diarrhea?

02:29.517 --> 02:31.685
( speaking Arabic )

02:31.685 --> 02:33.354
Baby no cry.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.588
Yeah, he's too sick to cry.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.957
Listen, we need
to bring him back with us.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.559
Look, your baby
needs medicine.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.661
We have to get him
to the hospital.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.730
( speaking Arabic )

02:44.732 --> 02:46.300
Where is that other doctor?

02:46.300 --> 02:47.568
Tired.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.769
Tired?

02:48.769 --> 02:50.471
Okay, wait right here.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.839
Dakarai,
what are you doing, man?

02:51.839 --> 02:53.774
( retching )
Whoa! What the hell?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.344
You all right?

02:56.344 --> 02:59.780
Varices,
varices getting worse.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.515
( retching )

03:01.515 --> 03:03.751
You told me your IV was
for a little stomach virus.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.354
Scarring in my liver.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.789
Schistosomiasis
when I was a child.

03:08.789 --> 03:09.957
Damn.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.659
Well, congratulations.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.828
You just became the proud winner
of a bed in tent #3.

03:14.828 --> 03:15.929
( retching )
( groans )

04:07.315 --> 04:09.049
Rashida Fallad.
She's 26 weeks pregnant,

04:09.049 --> 04:10.784
and she has hepatitis E.
Hepatitis E?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.920
I thought our
water was clean.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.389
Mm-mm, they go outside the camp,
drink from other sources.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.490
It shouldn't
be long now.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.524
I think
you're overreacting.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.858
The mortality rate
for hep E

04:18.858 --> 04:20.361
isn't very high.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.330
It is in pregnant women,
especially in Darfur.

04:22.330 --> 04:25.866
Over 30% of people who contract
the disease will die.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.000
Rashida.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.369
Uh-huh.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.370
Rashida.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.705
Encephalopathy is worse.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.641
She's pretty jaundiced.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.977
Scleral icterus.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.382
She's in hepatic coma.

04:45.353 --> 04:49.490
Ask her if she's been eating
or drinking.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.960
( speaking Arabic )

04:52.960 --> 04:55.896
Tell her that we've been giving
her antibiotics and glucose

04:55.896 --> 04:57.765
from an NG
feeding tube.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.640
What did she say?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.777
She wants to know if...

05:09.777 --> 05:13.714
if her daughter will die
today or tomorrow.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.619
Tell her I'm not sure.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.593
She wants to know if
we'll need the bed.

05:29.062 --> 05:32.032
No, no, we can wait.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.135
( speaking Arabic )

05:35.135 --> 05:36.670
PRATT:
Got a minute?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.907
Mm-hmm.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.709
So, this baby I
brought in yesterday,

05:41.709 --> 05:43.076
she's not doing so good.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.545
I'm having trouble
finding an IV site,

05:44.545 --> 05:46.113
and this kid is
getting pretty dry.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.848
Stop trying
to be so tough.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.116
I am tough.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.884
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

05:50.884 --> 05:51.919
I don't need a wife.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.086
I've already had three.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.088
Stephen, you feeling
any better?

05:55.088 --> 05:56.690
I don't want to be babied.
I am fine.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.492
Why don't you stay in bed
a little longer.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.560
I'm ready to work.
You're having
a paracentesis.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.794
Don't be an idiot.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.463
That's sound
medical advice.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.464
She has no bedside manner.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.832
Will you
talk to him?

06:04.832 --> 06:06.166
Stay in bed until I sign off
on your chart.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.801
When?
When I get to it.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.870
DAKARAI:
This is why
people hate doctors.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.138
He needed a
paracentesis?

06:11.138 --> 06:12.506
Took five liters
off his belly.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.507
Five liters?!

06:13.507 --> 06:15.008
Had him on Lasix
all night.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.644
We had to limit his sodium.
CARTER:
Good.

06:16.644 --> 06:17.678
The man shouldn't be working.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.779
He shouldn't even
be here.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.080
Dr. Dakarai is very committed.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.649
Uh-huh.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.684
This is Mahdi,
his mom and sister.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.185
I'm Dr. Carter.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.887
Can you tell her
that we're gonna try

06:26.887 --> 06:29.457
and give some fluids
to her baby?

06:31.158 --> 06:32.793
MAN:
Dr. John!

06:32.793 --> 06:34.528
They're bringing a man
from outside.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.663
They say he's been shot.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.130
Okay, 20 gauge in the femoral,

06:37.130 --> 06:39.467
and I want you to call me
if you need me, okay?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.671
CARTER:
Ishaak?!

06:43.671 --> 06:46.640
PRATT:
What?
His name is Ishaak.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.576
( Ishaak groaning )
What happened?

06:48.576 --> 06:50.043
We got two bullets
to his chest and leg.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.078
DAKARAI:
Look, I'm going
to help you.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.546
No, we got it!

06:52.546 --> 06:54.081
We handle gunshots
differently here.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.849
We know that.
Get back in bed!

06:57.951 --> 06:59.587
( groaning )

06:59.587 --> 07:01.021
CARTER:
I got an entrance wound,
right chest.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.756
Okay, belly
seems clear.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.758
Ishaak, you left
the compound.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.728
( grunts ):
Just to the perimeter...

07:07.728 --> 07:09.062
to help a family get water.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.197
He's got a strong carotid.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.832
Okay, try for that BP.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.867
Men on horses--

07:13.867 --> 07:15.503
they shot me.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.504
Let me guess: Janjaweed.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.806
Through-and-through,
left calf.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.173
100/60.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.875
Why are you always
where the trouble is?

07:21.875 --> 07:24.512
I try to help.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.779
Ishaak is a sheik.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.247
PRATT:
What do you mean--
like with a harem?

07:27.247 --> 07:28.549
No, I mean
like a leader.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.750
He's recognized as someone

07:29.750 --> 07:31.251
the other IDPs
can look up to.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.520
He's trying
to make a difference.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.754
He's trying to get people here.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.655
Yeah, well, he
should stop that.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.156
Why say such
a thing?!

07:36.156 --> 07:37.725
Because it's making people
want to kill him.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.860
Give me two liters
of saline wide open.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.596
Okay, got a good vein
in the antecube.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.866
I'm going in with the 18.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.035
Ishaak, we need
to move you to town.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.638
You need more surgery
than we can do for you here.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.740
I... I can't breathe.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.807
We have the oxygen extractor?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.108
ZAHRA:
Yeah, on its way.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.991
You treating a man
with a gunshot wound here--

08:10.991 --> 08:13.561
Ishaak Alazhari?
Not sure-- I'd have to
check with the doctors.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.228
You can't just come
in here like this.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.730
As long as there's no violation,
we'll leave.

08:16.730 --> 08:21.234
( speaking Arabic )

08:27.808 --> 08:29.577
DEBBIE:
Officer, please.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.811
Please wait outside.
I'll look around for you.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.645
We look for ourselves.

08:32.645 --> 08:33.614
DAKARAI:
You cannot be in here
with those weapons.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.015
You know the agreement

08:35.015 --> 08:36.750
that the Alliance has
with your government!

08:36.750 --> 08:39.152
We'll go where we need to go
and do what we need to do.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.822
Look, the NGO rules
apply even in Darfur.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.155
Debbie.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.761
Ishaak, this is oxygen that
should help you breathe.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.062
How are you doing, man?

08:49.062 --> 08:51.298
Feeling pain when I breathe.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.701
This man's been shot.

08:53.701 --> 08:54.902
Yeah, that's right.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.303
He's bleeding internally.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.705
He needs immediate attention
and transport

08:57.705 --> 08:59.272
to a surgical
facility.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.208
Ishaak Alazhari, did you report
this injury to my office?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.110
Come on.
He can do that later.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.912
Without a Form 8, he's got
no right to medical attention.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.914
He's got to fill out
a form first?

09:06.914 --> 09:09.917
PRATT:
It's not gonna help much
if he's already dead.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.685
No, no, come on.
Wait a minute.
Take it easy.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.186
( all shouting )

09:13.186 --> 09:14.622
PRATT:
What are you doing?!

09:14.622 --> 09:15.889
What the hell
is the matter with you?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.625
CARTER:
He's gonna die if you do this.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.059
OFFICER:
He's guilty
of a Form 8 violation,

09:19.059 --> 09:20.327
which requires that all gunshot
injuries be reported...

09:20.327 --> 09:21.629
PRATT:
He's here now!

09:21.629 --> 09:22.830
Please don't do this!

09:22.830 --> 09:24.698
DAKARAI:
If you are going to do this...

09:24.698 --> 09:26.199
Stephen!
Wait, you can't just
come in here shoving...

09:26.199 --> 09:27.735
( Pratt shouts )

09:27.735 --> 09:29.169
I'll send you a document
re-clarifying

09:29.169 --> 09:31.705
the Form 8 regulation,
so this does not happen again.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.306
Good day, Doc.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.680
Okay, okay, let's see.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.283
Damn!

09:44.351 --> 09:46.086
How does that feel?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.321
Feels like I got hit in the head
with a rifle butt.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.792
Better to be hit with
one than shot with one.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.160
You want something
for the pain?

09:53.160 --> 09:54.361
No, no, no,
I'll be fine.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.263
I've had hangovers
worse than this.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.166
Perhaps you should
drink less mouthwash.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.301
( sighs )
So what's going to happen
to that guy they took?

10:01.301 --> 10:03.403
Ishaak. They'll probably
bring him back for treatment

10:03.403 --> 10:05.172
when they are finished
interrogating him.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.807
He could be dead
by then.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.742
Oh, yes, I'm sure
they are aware of that.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.951
Hey.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.356
You should go back
to the compound.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.425
No, I'm okay.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.695
It's almost quitting time.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.033
He's bradycardic, 58...
0.5 epi.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.634
He's already had two doses.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.905
He's not responding.

10:37.905 --> 10:40.340
Because he's hypoxic
and acidotic.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.977
All right, give him another
bolus and find me a bag mask.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.445
Nope.

10:45.445 --> 10:49.049
He'll turn around
once the antibiotics kick in.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.719
I can bag him
through this.

10:51.719 --> 10:55.122
By yourself? All night?

10:55.122 --> 10:56.790
It could take days.

10:56.790 --> 11:00.427
Pulse is down to 40.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.229
I'm doing compressions.

11:05.465 --> 11:08.001
Are we just going
to watch him die?

11:08.001 --> 11:11.404
No, that's what his mother does.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.073
We have other patients.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.749
That's messed up.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.957
Would you please tell her
that we're very sorry?

11:32.025 --> 11:33.761
( speaking Arabic )

11:39.833 --> 11:43.403
CARTER:
Tell her that I know how
difficult it is to lose a child,

11:43.403 --> 11:48.441
that my own son died when he
was very young in hospital.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.163
She finds it hard
to believe

12:10.163 --> 12:13.801
that babies die
in Western hospitals.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.912
You should not have
let them take him away.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.847
We didn't have
a choice.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.381
Hey.
This is Ishaak's
wife, Sittina.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.083
Hi.
You treated my husband.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.318
I tried,
but they took him

12:31.318 --> 12:33.120
because he didn't
fill out some form.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.256
No! They took him away because
he tells people the truth,

12:36.256 --> 12:39.059
that it is not safe to go back
to the villages.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.061
People listen to him. He...

12:41.061 --> 12:42.395
Sittina?

12:42.395 --> 12:43.430
You okay?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.564
Maybe you
should sit down.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.266
Are you having
contractions?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.267
How far apart?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.568
( screaming )

12:48.568 --> 12:50.871
She's eight centimeters,
100% effaced.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.272
She's definitely having
this baby tonight.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.041
It'll be dark soon.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.076
Well, taking her back
to the residential compound.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.277
She can't have it here?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.879
She can, but we can't
stay with her.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.581
There's electricity
back at the compound.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.384
The only place I am going
is to the police station

13:04.384 --> 13:06.219
( grunts ):
to get my husband.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.355
You want the police
to deliver your baby?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.923
( groans ):
But Ishaak...

13:09.923 --> 13:11.224
Let's worry about the baby
first, okay?

13:11.224 --> 13:12.359
I'll have Ibrahim
bring the truck around.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.195
Here you go.
Grab the OB pack.

13:16.864 --> 13:17.998
Here we go.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.166
( panting )

13:27.374 --> 13:29.609
Take it easy, nice and slow.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.211
I got this.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.960
You're late.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.595
It's cinema night.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.363
We're moving
to the rec room.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.966
Gregory wants us to watch
Deuce Bigalow again.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.102
See if you can keep
everybody in there for
a little while, all right?

13:55.102 --> 13:56.636
Is everything all right?

13:56.636 --> 13:58.906
Yeah, it'll be fine.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.111
They turn the generators off
in the compound at night.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.980
The only power in the clinic
is used for cold storage.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.949
She would've had to deliver
the baby alone in the dark.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.919
Try and relax, huh?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.528
You okay?

14:21.528 --> 14:23.096
She's progressing
very well.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.397
She can probably start
pushing within the hour.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.665
Talking about you.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.200
I am tired.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.502
I've been on my feet all day.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.104
You are not tired?

14:31.104 --> 14:33.040
I am tired.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.975
I'm tired of you lying to me.
I'm tired of you ignoring

14:34.975 --> 14:37.044
a life-threatening illness,
which needs to be treated.

14:37.044 --> 14:40.080
Hey, hey, I promise...

14:40.080 --> 14:43.083
if I get any worse,
I will do IV, diuretics

14:43.083 --> 14:46.086
and sodium restrictions and
I will dry out my ascites.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.554
It's not good enough.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.256
You need the procedure.
Carter, what is it

14:49.256 --> 14:50.991
he needs?

14:50.991 --> 14:54.261
A transjugular intrahepatic
portal-systemic shunt.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.429
Yes, well,
interventional radiology

14:56.429 --> 14:57.664
is a little hard
to come by

14:57.664 --> 14:59.366
when we do not even have
an X-ray machine.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.134
Which is why you need to go
to Khartoum or Nairobi.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.435
And when I'm lying in bed
for a month,

15:02.435 --> 15:04.171
who is going to take care
of my patients?

15:04.171 --> 15:05.405
Don't know. Who's going
to take care of them

15:05.405 --> 15:06.673
when you're dead?

15:18.685 --> 15:20.420
( sighs )

15:25.993 --> 15:27.527
Long day, huh?

15:30.163 --> 15:33.433
The only thing longer than the
days out here are the nights.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.707
I'm okay, Carter. Really.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.676
Could have fooled me.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.213
This is nothing.

15:46.213 --> 15:49.016
It's my weekly ritual.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.051
Only way to get through
the pain and suffering

15:51.051 --> 15:53.253
that surrounds this place
is to...

15:53.253 --> 15:56.489
allow myself a good cry
every now and then.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.263
I feel better already.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.299
So this has nothing
to do with Stephen?

16:06.299 --> 16:08.701
Stephen makes me angry.
He doesn't make me cry.

16:12.672 --> 16:16.476
You tell me. You're a doctor.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.345
What's gonna happen
if he doesn't get treated?

16:18.345 --> 16:21.581
His condition's gonna get worse.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.650
It's already worse.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.124
( vehicle approaching )

16:39.699 --> 16:42.169
It's the police. Hide her.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.570
What? Where?

16:43.570 --> 16:45.272
CARTER:
What's going on?

16:45.272 --> 16:47.074
It's the police.
We got to hide her.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.108
( groaning )

16:48.108 --> 16:49.242
Another contraction?
Where?

16:49.242 --> 16:51.078
Let's put her
in the bathroom.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.579
Are these the same men
that took my husband?

16:52.579 --> 16:54.281
I don't know.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.416
Ask them. I want to know
what they have done with him.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.218
Just make sure you
keep her quiet.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.353
( screams )
Okay, okay...
Just breathe.

17:03.290 --> 17:08.828
( speaking Arabic )

17:08.828 --> 17:10.696
What's going on?

17:10.696 --> 17:13.633
He is searching
for Ishaak's wife.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.234
I told him come
in the morning,

17:15.234 --> 17:16.669
search the camp.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.806
( speaking Arabic )

17:19.806 --> 17:22.108
He thinks we brought her here.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.643
No, we don't, we don't
treat patients here.

17:23.643 --> 17:24.644
I told him that.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.113
( speaking Arabic )

17:26.113 --> 17:29.649
Now he wants
to search the house.
No.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.384
The housing unit--
that's off-limits.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.520
( speaking Arabic )

17:33.520 --> 17:35.788
Hey, come on,
you guys.

17:35.788 --> 17:36.789
Do you know
what time it is?

17:36.789 --> 17:38.258
Everybody's sleeping inside.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.560
Okay, okay...

17:44.364 --> 17:45.398
They're in the house.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.399
( agonized scream )

17:46.399 --> 17:47.834
You have to keep her quiet.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.669
She's in labor.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.704
Try to breathe
through the pain.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.645
Breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe...

17:58.645 --> 18:01.781
Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh...

18:01.781 --> 18:04.684
( rap music playing )

18:10.257 --> 18:11.591
Hey, what's up, fellas?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.426
Whoa, whoa, sorry.
I'm next.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.163
And I don't think
it's gonna leave a scar.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.297
Thanks for asking.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.599
( pounding on door )

18:22.702 --> 18:25.738
( pounding, speaking Arabic )

18:27.807 --> 18:30.510
Look, I've been standing out
here for 20 minutes, okay?

18:30.510 --> 18:31.744
DAKARAI:
Pratt.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.683
All right.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.762
( music stops )

18:51.731 --> 18:54.367
What the hell are you doing?!
Get out!

18:54.367 --> 18:56.203
Get out!

19:00.940 --> 19:03.810
Your superiors are going
to hear about this.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.284
( panting )

19:11.284 --> 19:13.453
Something is wrong.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.955
( screaming )

19:15.955 --> 19:17.357
Hang in there.
Hang in there, Sattina.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.326
You're doing great.
I feel the head.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.493
PRATT:
I see thick meconium.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.494
Deceleration,
a long one.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.529
How low?

19:22.529 --> 19:24.231
Low.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.766
Occiput's posterior.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.569
We do not have time
for the baby to turn.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.704
Prep for a C-section?

19:31.704 --> 19:32.939
Are you out
of your mind?

19:32.939 --> 19:34.541
All right, Sittina,

19:34.541 --> 19:36.909
your baby is showing signs
of very serious distress.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.578
A vaginal delivery is
gonna be too dangerous.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.946
We need
to do a Caesarean.

19:39.946 --> 19:43.283
No, please... save it.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.751
I'm going to put some
anesthesia in your back.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.553
You will lose feeling
from the waist down.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.521
Okay, come on. Ready?

19:48.521 --> 19:51.491
Ishaak! Oh, Ishaak!

19:53.626 --> 19:54.961
Give me some more
counterpressure there, Pratt.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.364
Yep.
Debbie, will you get
a blanket?

19:57.364 --> 19:59.866
Okay, I got it.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.569
Here we go.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.703
( grunting )

20:05.305 --> 20:06.406
Got it.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.640
It's a girl, Sittina.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.875
DAKARAI:
Allah has blessed you

20:08.875 --> 20:11.778
with a healthy child.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.713
( baby crying )
SITTINA:
Get her to my husband.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.351
There's a lot of
blood in the pelvis.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.486
CARTER:
All right, try a little
uterine massage in there.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.853
I am. I got no suction.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.955
I can't see where
she's bleeding from.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.458
SITTINA:
Ishaak?

20:25.458 --> 20:28.728
I need some sterile
four-by-fours, and keep them
coming.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.031
If they find out who we are,
they will kill him.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.333
Who you are?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.502
We helped to form the HRD.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.470
What's she talking about?

20:37.470 --> 20:40.540
HRD-- it's a human rights group
based in Khartoum.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.909
"Human Rights
for Darfur."

20:42.909 --> 20:44.644
They will kill him
if they know.

20:44.644 --> 20:45.978
Please...

20:45.978 --> 20:48.448
Oh, man, she's bleeding out.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.683
This was a bad idea.

20:50.683 --> 20:51.951
We've got no blood,
no pressors, no pit,

20:51.951 --> 20:53.886
no methergine.

20:53.886 --> 20:54.987
What are we
supposed to do now?

20:54.987 --> 20:56.656
She needs a
hysterectomy.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.391
We'll bring her to a
hospital in Alfashir.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.693
It's too late to drive.
She'll have to go tomorrow.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.730
Because of a bunch
of thugs on camels.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.732
They also have
trucks and guns.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.002
Lots and lots of guns.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.571
I think I can tie off
the uterine arteries.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.439
That'll buy us
some time.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.906
Give me some O-chromic

21:13.906 --> 21:15.608
on the longest
needle we got.
Not enough time.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.411
Couple of hours, her uterus
will start to become ischemic.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.480
That is the best chance
that we got right now.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.683
I grew up in Detroit.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.518
I can be in Alfashir
in two hours.
You didn't even want

21:25.518 --> 21:26.653
to bring her here.
PRATT:
I know,

21:26.653 --> 21:28.087
and I made a mistake.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.522
If we'd left her back there,
she never would've

21:29.522 --> 21:31.424
delivered safely--
baby would've died.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.759
Slow down, Pratt.

21:34.394 --> 21:37.430
Okay, the uterine arteries
are tied off.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.466
This is the only chance
she's got, you know it.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.468
She may not
even survive the trip.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.503
Yeah, but she's dead
if she stays here.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.471
If she dies making
the journey,

21:44.471 --> 21:47.374
well, at least we tried.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.111
Okay. I'll go with you.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.846
No, John,

21:53.846 --> 21:56.015
you and Debbie should go
to the police.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.117
Find Ishaak.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.786
You have a much better
chance of getting
him out of there.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.454
He and I, we'll close,

22:01.454 --> 22:03.656
and then we will bring
her on to the hospital.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.692
All right.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.727
Okay.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.493
Assalamu alaikum.

22:40.493 --> 22:41.794
( speaking Arabic )

22:41.794 --> 22:43.830
We'd like to see
Ishaak Alazhari.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.831
No.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.499
You can't see him.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.734
Why not?

22:47.734 --> 22:50.637
He's under arrest.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.138
On what charge?

22:57.610 --> 22:59.078
He's been shot, he needs

22:59.078 --> 23:00.747
medical attention.
CARTER:
I'm a doctor.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.482
I would like to evaluate
his medical condition.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.160
How's she doing back there?

23:15.528 --> 23:17.497
She is breathing.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.833
What the hell is that?

23:22.702 --> 23:23.836
Janjaweed.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.672
We must go back.

23:25.672 --> 23:28.174
Oh, we got a traffic jam.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.646
If we stop,
they will take the truck...

23:33.646 --> 23:34.647
leave her to die,

23:34.647 --> 23:35.948
or worse.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.685
Okay. All right,
then we don't stop.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.787
Just cover her up and hold on.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.523
Now, hold on, Dakarai!

23:43.523 --> 23:44.491
Pratt!

23:44.491 --> 23:45.692
Hold on!

23:45.692 --> 23:47.193
( gunshots )
Look out!

23:47.193 --> 23:48.728
Oh!

23:49.762 --> 23:51.731
Get down, Dakarai!

23:56.536 --> 23:57.870
( Sadig speaking Arabic )

23:57.870 --> 24:00.707
Did you tell him that we work
for the Alliance?

24:00.707 --> 24:02.642
The Ramalah Camp.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.010
Mm-hmm.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.712
All right, look,
is it money?

24:05.712 --> 24:07.514
'Cause I can get some.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.181
( speaking Arabic )

24:10.082 --> 24:11.851
You must leave now.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.152
Oh, no, I want... I would
like to speak to your boss.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.721
Very busy.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.589
Should I tell him
that you walked in

24:16.589 --> 24:18.891
on this American woman
while she was bathing?

24:18.891 --> 24:20.727
Or should I tell
the consulate

24:20.727 --> 24:22.962
that an American woman's
privacy was violated?

24:23.996 --> 24:26.132
How much money?

24:27.867 --> 24:30.036
DEBBIE:
Ishaak? Ishaak, can you hear me?

24:30.036 --> 24:32.572
I need to see him.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.206
No, I need to go in there.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.252
( coughs )

24:53.793 --> 24:55.662
He's not responding.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.039
He's dead.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.019
The tire is flat.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.622
Yeah. I think they hit the
oil pan and the radiator, too.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.023
She's getting pretty hot.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.828
What is that?

25:28.828 --> 25:30.296
Lasix for...?

25:30.296 --> 25:33.600
Prozac for your driving.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.002
How fast can a horse go
with a rider?

25:36.002 --> 25:38.304
I don't know,
maybe 30 miles an hour.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.773
Okay.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.809
So, we'd be going
45 miles an hour

25:42.809 --> 25:45.745
right before the, uh,
tire blew out.

25:45.745 --> 25:46.913
It's more like 50.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.314
Okay, good.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.949
Then we've got enough time.

25:49.949 --> 25:50.950
For what?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.284
To change the tire.

25:54.286 --> 25:57.189
Maybe somebody in that village
can help us out over there.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.726
( scoffs ):
Maybe...

25:59.726 --> 26:00.993
Ah!

26:00.993 --> 26:03.830
If there were somebody
living there.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.638
( groans )

26:17.243 --> 26:18.144
You all right?

26:18.144 --> 26:20.012
DAKARAI:
Yes.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.848
( engine shuts off )

26:22.849 --> 26:24.717
( door slams )

26:24.717 --> 26:27.319
( panting )

26:33.660 --> 26:37.897
The people we treat every day...
it is places

26:37.897 --> 26:40.366
like this from
which they come...

26:40.366 --> 26:43.736
before the Janjaweed
burn them out.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.838
( panting ):
Oh.

27:06.926 --> 27:09.696
( horn honking )

27:16.235 --> 27:18.204
He's got agonal respirations
and a thready pulse.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.305
He's alive?
Barely.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.106
Don't tell the police.

27:20.106 --> 27:20.907
You ready to lift?

27:20.907 --> 27:22.809
One, two, three, go!

27:22.809 --> 27:23.943
All right, Zahra,
I want you to get
another IV started

27:23.943 --> 27:24.977
and get him
back on oxygen.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.813
What can I do to help?

27:26.813 --> 27:28.748
You can transfer
a unit of O-neg
out of the fridge,

27:28.748 --> 27:30.883
and when she's done, you can
squeeze in a liter of saline.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.719
He's got decreased breath sounds
on the right.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.290
Possible hemo-pneumo.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.126
He'd going to need a chest tube.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.761
I'll get it.
Where do you keep them?
We don't.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.429
Uh, we're going
to have to improvise.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.131
Get me a scalpel
and a curved Kelly

27:45.131 --> 27:47.333
and a... NG tube.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.301
As soon as the blood
that's compressing his lung

27:49.301 --> 27:51.003
is removed, his pulse

27:51.003 --> 27:52.404
should get stronger.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.873
DEBBIE:
What about the bleeding?
Should stop.

27:53.873 --> 27:54.907
If it doesn't?

27:57.209 --> 27:59.278
Why don't you see if you
can go radio Dakarai?

27:59.278 --> 28:01.247
They should be
in Alfashir by now.

28:01.247 --> 28:04.817
Ow!

28:04.817 --> 28:06.285
Do we have any extra water?!

28:06.285 --> 28:07.820
DAKARAI:
No.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.288
What about saline?

28:09.288 --> 28:10.422
Four liters.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.158
Okay, toss me one.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.425
Ah!

28:13.425 --> 28:14.827
Yeah.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.464
I got to say,
this is the first time

28:18.464 --> 28:19.999
I've ever given a bolus
to a truck before.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.400
( chuckles )

28:25.304 --> 28:26.973
( shouting Arabic )

28:29.341 --> 28:30.777
PRATT:
Take it easy, man.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.378
( shouting Arabic )

28:32.378 --> 28:35.081
( speaking Arabic )

28:42.088 --> 28:43.322
We just want to get her
to the hospital.

28:43.322 --> 28:44.323
Please tell him that.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.192
I'm trying!

28:46.192 --> 28:47.860
( speaking Arabic )

28:47.860 --> 28:49.161
No!

28:54.867 --> 28:58.270
( horse neighing )

28:58.270 --> 29:00.807
( panting )

29:15.822 --> 29:18.057
His friends will not be
far behind.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.896
If you try
and save him,

29:23.896 --> 29:26.999
we will never get
away from here.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.537
There is nothing
you can do for him now.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.910
Come on. Get up.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.078
Come on!

29:39.078 --> 29:41.513
Watch your step!

29:41.513 --> 29:44.050
All right, go.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.395
Oh! Oh, damn!

29:56.395 --> 29:57.396
What?

29:57.396 --> 29:58.564
The engine has seized.

29:58.564 --> 30:01.100
We're going to
have to hoof it.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.368
We got to walk from here.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.235
DAKARAI:
I can't!

30:03.235 --> 30:04.403
Why the hell not?!

30:04.403 --> 30:05.571
I don't think
I can walk,

30:05.571 --> 30:07.273
and I will only
slow you down.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.507
I can't leave you here.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.376
You have to.
No way.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.411
Why don't you
leave me the rifle?

30:12.411 --> 30:13.579
Then perhaps I can
occupy his friends

30:13.579 --> 30:15.147
while you get
to Alfashir.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.585
How far away's the city
from here?

30:19.585 --> 30:22.088
It is still several miles,
but you can get there.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.423
And you really think
she's going to make it?

30:24.423 --> 30:25.925
She will die if you don't.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.960
You ever fire one of these?

30:27.960 --> 30:28.961
I have never held a weapon.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.063
PRATT:
Just point and shoot.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.265
Okay, Sittina.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.234
We're going to go on foot patrol
from here on in.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.602
I'm going to give you
a little something

30:36.602 --> 30:38.470
for the pain, okay?

30:38.470 --> 30:40.406
( speaking Arabic )

30:42.308 --> 30:44.176
( speaking Arabic )

30:47.013 --> 30:48.981
What... what the hell
is she saying?

30:48.981 --> 30:52.051
She called us angels.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.986
I said there are no angels here.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.289
Speak for yourself.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.465
( gunshots )

31:10.002 --> 31:12.104
( rapid gunfire )

31:32.624 --> 31:36.195
You ever been to Mozambique,
Sittina?

31:36.195 --> 31:39.698
Hear they got
great beaches there.

31:39.698 --> 31:43.335
White sands,
cool waters...

31:43.335 --> 31:47.373
Yeah, I definitely got
to get me to Mozambique.

31:47.373 --> 31:50.309
( rumbling in distance )

31:52.278 --> 31:54.013
( panting )

31:54.013 --> 31:55.681
Okay.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.017
Either those are the good guys,

31:58.017 --> 32:01.320
and we're saved...

32:01.320 --> 32:04.123
or they're bad guys,
and we're dead.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.524
Either way...

32:07.526 --> 32:09.195
I'm done walking.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.629
( groans )

32:26.745 --> 32:28.514
Very sick.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.016
That's right.

32:30.016 --> 32:32.518
( speaking Arabic )

32:32.518 --> 32:34.420
I tell him fast.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.388
Good.
You're English?

32:36.388 --> 32:37.756
James Bond? 007?

32:37.756 --> 32:39.425
( hums theme song ):
Duh-duh-duh-duh.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.227
Duh-duh-duh-duh.
No.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.395
American? Rambro?

32:43.395 --> 32:45.197
( imitates gunfire )

32:45.197 --> 32:47.599
Yeah. Rambro.

32:47.599 --> 32:50.036
Good stuff.

33:06.752 --> 33:10.156
Help me! Please! Please!

33:10.156 --> 33:12.158
I need a doctor!

33:12.158 --> 33:13.225
Please!

33:15.761 --> 33:17.763
( strained grunting )

33:17.763 --> 33:19.431
( Pratt speaking Arabic )

33:19.431 --> 33:22.234
Please!

33:22.234 --> 33:24.736
( breathlessly ):
She needs saline, blood,

33:24.736 --> 33:26.638
antibiotics and a surgeon.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.707
Hurry!

33:28.707 --> 33:29.741
( panting )

33:47.093 --> 33:48.327
( baby crying )

33:57.103 --> 34:00.239
Good stuff.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.708
( quietly ):
Yeah.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.777
Good stuff.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.614
( panting )

34:08.614 --> 34:12.118
( panting )

34:19.125 --> 34:21.493
CARTER:
Ishaak's doing much better.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.495
The bleeding's stopped.

34:23.495 --> 34:24.763
That's good.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.465
He keeps asking
for Sittina.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.234
No word yet.

34:28.234 --> 34:29.467
Did you try the radio?

34:29.467 --> 34:30.835
They stopped answering
the radio hours ago.

34:30.835 --> 34:31.870
Still...

34:31.870 --> 34:33.572
There's no signal, John,

34:33.572 --> 34:35.574
and I haven't resorted
to sending smoke signals yet.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.147
Okay.

34:45.817 --> 34:46.818
Sorry.

34:58.164 --> 35:00.866
Come on.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.701
Let's go introduce him
to his daughter.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.526
PRATT:
Whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop!

35:27.526 --> 35:29.461
Careful! Careful!

35:42.308 --> 35:45.577
( panting )

36:04.663 --> 36:07.866
( panting )

36:20.846 --> 36:23.482
( blowing )

36:23.482 --> 36:26.352
( tapping object )

36:30.256 --> 36:32.491
Come on. Let's go.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.261
Let's go.

36:48.674 --> 36:53.579
We had hoped to be back in our
village before the child came.

36:55.581 --> 36:58.550
To be born in this place--

36:58.550 --> 37:02.288
it wasn't what we
wanted for our child.

37:03.289 --> 37:05.291
( baby fussing )

37:05.291 --> 37:08.360
Now I can only hope that
before she is grown up,

37:08.360 --> 37:10.396
we can go back to our village.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.731
( baby quiets )

37:12.731 --> 37:15.734
( clears throat ):
We tried calling the hospital
in Alfashir,

37:15.734 --> 37:18.804
but we haven't been able
to find out anything yet.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.772
She's there.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.040
I'm sure of it.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.775
ZAHRA:
Dr. Carter.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.479
Greg, you gave us
quite a scare.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.782
The van broke down.

37:30.782 --> 37:34.786
Turns out even in Africa,
cabs don't stop for a brother.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.622
Sittina?

37:36.622 --> 37:37.789
She's going to be okay.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.325
They're working
on her in town.

37:39.325 --> 37:41.593
She should be able
to come back in a few days.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.429
( speaks Arabic )

37:43.429 --> 37:46.932
You guys fixed him up
pretty good.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.734
Nice job.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.870
Greg, where's Stephen?

37:58.510 --> 38:00.979
He couldn't keep going...

38:00.979 --> 38:03.782
and Sittina...

38:03.782 --> 38:05.517
Tell me.

38:06.852 --> 38:09.054
I left him on the road.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.422
Where?

38:10.422 --> 38:11.690
At a
burned-out village.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.359
I went back for him,

38:13.359 --> 38:14.693
but by the time
I got there,

38:14.693 --> 38:18.664
I could tell the
Janjaweed had been there.

38:18.664 --> 38:21.767
They torched the truck.

38:21.767 --> 38:24.370
Here.

38:24.370 --> 38:25.637
I'm sorry.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.739
We need to go out
and look for him.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.040
No, it's too late.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.776
Be dark by the time
we get there.

38:30.776 --> 38:33.078
I'll take you out first thing
in the morning.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.846
PRATT:
Debbie.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.887
We didn't have a lot of options.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.955
I mean, if we stayed,
we'd all be dead.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.824
He made me keep going.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.460
You did what you had to do.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.063
So did Dakarai.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.767
Can you work?

38:55.767 --> 38:56.835
Yeah, in a minute.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.870
Okay.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.012
Did you name her yet?

39:07.012 --> 39:08.647
Yes.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.416
Amala.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.819
That's beautiful.

39:15.153 --> 39:17.423
It means "hope."

39:25.431 --> 39:28.033
( sighs )

39:41.747 --> 39:44.716
( children chattering )

40:11.510 --> 40:13.579
*

40:25.624 --> 40:27.626
( indistinct conversations )

41:00.959 --> 41:03.829
DAKARAI ( breathlessly ):
Yes, it is good to see you.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.597
( Pratt laughing )

41:05.597 --> 41:10.636
( Dakarai panting )

41:10.636 --> 41:12.137
After they had

41:12.137 --> 41:13.905
burned the truck,
I saw no reason to stick around.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.674
( speaks Arabic )

41:15.674 --> 41:18.009
( speaks Arabic )

41:18.009 --> 41:19.645
Anyway, it was safer to walk.

41:19.645 --> 41:22.047
Especially after
all of your driving.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.583
( both laughing )

41:24.583 --> 41:26.251
Well, I'm glad
you made it back...

41:26.251 --> 41:28.787
You are well?
I am now.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.626
( both laughing )

41:53.078 --> 41:55.313
Why didn't you go to
Alfashir, you dummy?

41:55.313 --> 41:57.583
They could've
treated you there.

41:59.585 --> 42:00.952
Maybe next week.

42:00.952 --> 42:04.255
Ibrahim, let's take
him to the clinic.

42:04.255 --> 42:07.192
Tell Zahra to start him
on lactulose and saline.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.094
( chuckles )

42:12.230 --> 42:13.264
Careful.
Careful.

42:13.264 --> 42:14.866
Careful.

42:30.882 --> 42:34.620
PRATT:
That's one stubborn
son of a bitch.

42:34.620 --> 42:36.888
CARTER:
I know the type.

42:36.888 --> 42:39.991
You know, Carter...
( sighs )

42:39.991 --> 42:42.861
I know I got my way of being.

42:42.861 --> 42:45.664
That damn sure doesn't mean
I don't see or...

42:45.664 --> 42:49.801
feel everything
that's going on around me.

42:49.801 --> 42:52.237
Tell you the truth,

42:52.237 --> 42:55.373
I never wanted to be around
this type of suffering.

42:55.373 --> 42:57.108
I mean, who would?

42:57.108 --> 43:00.879
But I am glad I came here.

43:00.879 --> 43:03.649
I'm glad you came, too.

43:03.649 --> 43:06.251
'Cause I sure as hell
am not going to take
the blame for that van.

43:06.251 --> 43:08.720
Oh, gee, thanks.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.756
It's okay. They'll take it
out of your paycheck.

43:10.756 --> 43:11.790
What do you mean?

43:11.790 --> 43:13.759
We actually
get paid for this?

43:13.759 --> 43:16.227
Whoa! Hey!

43:16.227 --> 43:18.296
Okay. Where we going?

43:18.296 --> 43:19.998
( Pratt chuckles, boy chatters )
