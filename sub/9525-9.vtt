WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:02.850
I'm gonna clear it.

00:02.884 --> 00:04.252
- Get 'em.
- Nope.

00:04.286 --> 00:05.753
That didn't...
that didn't work at all.

00:05.787 --> 00:07.355
Ow. Ow.
A little bit.

00:07.389 --> 00:09.524
Hey, if you guys see anything
ninja-related, tell me,

00:09.558 --> 00:11.125
'cause I am back on my
ninja kick.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.060
- Okay.
- I'm gonna get a shower radio,

00:13.094 --> 00:15.263
so I can literally
rog out with my cog out.

00:15.297 --> 00:17.231
Or we could just stick
to the camping list,

00:17.266 --> 00:18.699
get the supplies we need,
right?

00:18.733 --> 00:20.401
Definitely,
but first, I want to get

00:20.435 --> 00:21.835
the stuff that I want
to get first.

00:21.870 --> 00:23.271
- Yeah.
- Know what I'm saying?

00:23.305 --> 00:24.772
- I'm gonna do that too.
- All right, just...

00:24.806 --> 00:27.542
you know, travel shampoos.
Look for 'em.

00:27.576 --> 00:31.279
Come on, 35 bucks?
For what?

00:31.313 --> 00:33.113
Oh, plugs into the car.
That's cool.

00:33.148 --> 00:34.848
Going camping there,
Paul bunyan?

00:34.883 --> 00:36.116
Uh, no, me and my buddies are

00:36.151 --> 00:38.386
gonna follow a concert tour,

00:38.420 --> 00:40.221
so we're just gonna,
like, be camping out.

00:40.255 --> 00:41.889
- That sounds fun.
- Yeah, it should be.

00:41.923 --> 00:43.424
I'm not really
a great outdoors guy, though.

00:43.458 --> 00:44.792
You know, unless there's
a bald-headed bear.

00:44.826 --> 00:46.026
- Yeah.
- From the movie, um...

00:46.061 --> 00:47.728
what movie's that?

00:47.762 --> 00:50.097
It's <i>the great outdoors.</i>
What are you doing?

00:50.131 --> 00:51.765
- Shh.
- I don't think we should...

00:51.800 --> 00:53.100
are you pregnant?
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

00:53.134 --> 00:54.902
It's not for you to know

00:54.936 --> 00:56.136
what's inside this belly.
You're squeezing so hard.

00:56.171 --> 00:57.738
- You like that?
- I like it.

00:57.772 --> 00:59.807
Oh, look at that.
Someone's up.

00:59.841 --> 01:01.108
- Oh, yeah.
- Someone's up.

01:01.142 --> 01:02.443
I'm up.

01:02.477 --> 01:04.178
- Morning.
- I'm up and at 'em.

01:04.212 --> 01:05.613
Don't do that with your face.
Don't do that.

01:05.647 --> 01:07.081
I don't like that.
That's better.

01:07.115 --> 01:08.316
Oh, God, all right,
all right, all right.

01:13.355 --> 01:14.655
Aha.

01:14.690 --> 01:16.257
Wait, did you just take
a picture of me?

01:16.291 --> 01:19.260
- Thank you.
- Who are you?

01:19.294 --> 01:20.628
Don't...
You need some help there,

01:20.662 --> 01:21.895
my friend?
What?

01:21.930 --> 01:24.665
Uh, um, no.
No.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.967
I'm, uh... I'm all right.

01:27.001 --> 01:28.969
I'm just getting some pants.

01:29.003 --> 01:32.172
- How about a larger size?
- No, I-I think they're good.

01:32.207 --> 01:34.074
So.

01:34.109 --> 01:35.343
Wear 'em out.

01:36.612 --> 01:39.580
Good day.

01:54.254 --> 01:55.487
Yo, Ders.

01:55.522 --> 01:56.923
Check it out.
Look who we ran into.

01:56.957 --> 01:58.390
Tez has let us...

01:58.425 --> 02:00.059
he's gonna let us
borrow his rv to go

02:00.093 --> 02:01.493
to the Xzibit concert
this weekend.

02:01.528 --> 02:03.262
- Yes!
- Cool.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.497
I have to admit, I was, like,
stressing really about it, guys,

02:05.532 --> 02:06.966
but I think now this...

02:07.000 --> 02:09.435
this trip's gonna be
a little less in tents.

02:09.469 --> 02:12.205
"In tents"? Get it?
"In tents." That's good.

02:12.239 --> 02:14.506
That's good.
That's good.

02:14.541 --> 02:17.576
"In tents."
That's good.

02:17.610 --> 02:19.411
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

02:19.446 --> 02:20.713
Yeah, but tents
are for children.

02:20.747 --> 02:22.414
Rvs are for cool-ass
widowed grandpas

02:22.449 --> 02:24.150
who are single
and ready to tingle.

02:24.184 --> 02:25.751
Yeah, we're gonna be

02:25.785 --> 02:28.387
some tangling-ass grandpas
this weekend, man.

02:28.421 --> 02:30.823
What's up
with the kid's ski pants, huh?

02:30.858 --> 02:32.124
Michael Jackson special?

02:32.159 --> 02:33.960
Everything half-off kids?

02:35.462 --> 02:37.096
I was reading
this joke calendar back there.

02:37.130 --> 02:39.365
June was funny, man.
You should get it.

02:39.399 --> 02:41.133
I will,
but it's, like, 12 bucks.

02:41.168 --> 02:44.136
You are not gonna believe what
just happened to me.

02:44.171 --> 02:47.240
Uhoh!
Hottie coming through, y'all.

02:47.274 --> 02:50.609
I'd like you to meet
my bangin'-ass wife, Colleen.

02:50.643 --> 02:52.544
- Hi. How you doing?
- Hey.

02:52.579 --> 02:54.613
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:54.647 --> 02:56.249
Oh, monty, I'll see you
at the checkout, okay?

02:56.283 --> 02:57.549
Hey, did you get
those baby naming books.

02:57.584 --> 02:58.985
I did.

02:59.019 --> 03:01.153
Y'all, check this out.
We having a little girl.

03:01.188 --> 03:02.755
And we gonna name her Montessa.

03:02.789 --> 03:04.323
No, we're not.
We talked about this.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.724
Okay.

03:05.759 --> 03:08.294
- Okay, I'll see you there.
- Mm-hmm.

03:08.328 --> 03:11.797
Ten years of marriage,
and she still got a ass

03:11.831 --> 03:13.432
like a black tennis player.

03:13.466 --> 03:14.833
Ain't that right, guys?

03:14.868 --> 03:16.502
What?
I...

03:16.536 --> 03:18.704
Didn't see it. Wouldn't look.

03:18.738 --> 03:20.539
She's your wife.

03:20.573 --> 03:22.408
Listen, y'all,
I gotta go break me off

03:22.442 --> 03:24.476
a piece of
this country white bread.

03:24.511 --> 03:26.678
You 'bout to get
re-pregnatized, girl!

03:26.713 --> 03:30.049
So, uh, you said something
crazy happened?

03:30.083 --> 03:31.884
Yeah.
I, um...

03:31.919 --> 03:35.654
I just saw O.J. Simpson trying
on isotoners that way.

03:35.688 --> 03:37.423
- O.J. Simpson is here?
- Yeah, just over there.

03:37.457 --> 03:39.225
He's my favorite killer.
O.J.!

03:39.259 --> 03:40.692
- He's trying gloves on?
- Yeah.

03:40.727 --> 03:41.894
O.J.!

03:41.929 --> 03:43.862
- This is bad.
- O.J.?

03:43.897 --> 03:46.065
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

03:46.099 --> 03:47.900
Buddy, hey, ho.
Hold up, hold up.

03:47.935 --> 03:50.903
What are you trying to do?
You trying to kill me?

03:50.938 --> 03:52.104
I didn't know you were there,

03:52.139 --> 03:53.239
but it sounds like
a good idea now.

03:53.273 --> 03:54.606
What are you doing, dude?

03:54.641 --> 03:56.042
What's it look like I'm doing?

03:56.076 --> 03:57.410
Okay, I want to talk
to you bros just before

03:57.444 --> 03:59.011
y'all bros just went
to the concert,

03:59.046 --> 04:01.080
so I slept behind
your bros' car, dudes.

04:01.114 --> 04:03.916
- That makes sense.
- Karl, I already told you, man.

04:03.951 --> 04:05.051
You can't come to the concert.

04:05.085 --> 04:07.019
I'm sorry.
Why not?

04:07.054 --> 04:09.188
'Cause you always get crazy
and start fights at concerts.

04:09.222 --> 04:10.823
- Always.
- No, I don't.

04:10.857 --> 04:12.558
- You do.
- No, I don't.

04:12.592 --> 04:14.893
Dude, do you not remember
the 311 mosh pit?

04:14.928 --> 04:16.262
Yeah, that was a great pit,
man.

04:16.296 --> 04:18.197
Very chill mosh.
Great people in there.

04:18.231 --> 04:21.733
Yeah, really chill until you
bit through a little girl's ear.

04:21.767 --> 04:24.770
I'm sorry, Blake, but I was
just trying to come original.

04:24.804 --> 04:26.772
You hit Rebeca Mcentire
in the tit with a rock.

04:26.806 --> 04:28.007
Yeah, that's what you said.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.741
You said,
"take this, reba tits,"

04:29.776 --> 04:31.710
and you threw a rock.
You... you did that.

04:31.744 --> 04:34.447
It's the live music, okay?
It's the energy of it all.

04:34.481 --> 04:36.182
You know,
it just, like, goes in,

04:36.216 --> 04:39.352
and it takes over my soul,
and then it 9/11s my whole body,

04:39.386 --> 04:41.087
sending it in to "cha-os,"
and I'm just, like...

04:41.121 --> 04:43.622
but really concerts
are just a place

04:43.656 --> 04:44.991
for you to find people to fight,
right?

04:45.025 --> 04:46.725
- Yeah.
- Great, that's what I thought.

04:46.759 --> 04:48.294
- Sorry, Karl.
- Hey, horrible seeing you.

04:48.328 --> 04:51.163
Stay stupid, human penis.
Later, duder.

04:51.198 --> 04:53.565
Wait, guys.
What about the rap music van?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.434
What am I gonna do with that?

04:55.469 --> 04:57.903
I don't know.
You could wash it.

04:57.937 --> 05:02.108
Oh, wash it?
Yeah, that's gonna do...

05:07.047 --> 05:09.382
Go ahead.
Go to work, man.

05:09.416 --> 05:11.050
Whoo!

05:11.084 --> 05:12.485
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ho.

05:12.519 --> 05:13.919
We're doing it, guys.

05:13.953 --> 05:16.622
We're officially
doing <i>road rules,</i> man.

05:16.656 --> 05:18.991
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- This is great.

05:19.026 --> 05:20.493
Do you guys know what
this thing does to panties?

05:20.527 --> 05:24.096
Sops them, then drops them.
Yes, it does.

05:24.131 --> 05:25.664
Yeah, chicks love dudes
with rvs.

05:25.698 --> 05:26.932
My Uncle drives one.

05:26.966 --> 05:28.401
Gets laid all the time.
Yeah?

05:28.435 --> 05:30.302
He's a coke dealer also,
so that might

05:30.337 --> 05:31.937
have something to do with it.

05:31.971 --> 05:33.972
It's probably what he did
to buy the rv, you know?

05:34.007 --> 05:35.707
And I want the best bed
'cause I'm probably

05:35.742 --> 05:36.975
gonna be doing some "fugzin'."

05:37.010 --> 05:39.145
- Well, we all want that.
- You better be.

05:39.179 --> 05:41.947
Yeah. But whoever touches
the rv first gets it.

05:41.981 --> 05:43.349
Wait no. What?

05:43.383 --> 05:45.918
- Oh! You suckers.
- Damn it, Adam.

05:45.952 --> 05:48.787
You have to give us a little bit
of advance notice.

05:48.821 --> 05:51.623
Whoever touches the other side,
gets to control the radio.

05:51.658 --> 05:52.858
Ready, set, go.
Wait, no...

05:52.892 --> 05:54.760
I said ready, set, go.

05:54.794 --> 05:55.961
Yeah.

05:55.995 --> 05:58.064
Uh, hey, Montez.

05:58.098 --> 06:01.200
We're just gonna take a tour
of the rv if that's cool.

06:01.234 --> 06:03.936
You want me to take
your garba... okay.

06:03.970 --> 06:05.971
You have a bag full
of double-ended dildos?

06:06.005 --> 06:07.339
That's used.
That's was used probably.

06:07.374 --> 06:08.674
Strap-ons...
is this Evan stone?

06:08.708 --> 06:10.076
What's he's doing back there?

06:10.110 --> 06:11.743
Is that Evan stone?
He's my favorite.

06:11.778 --> 06:14.513
Man, that's $1,200 worth
of premium sex toys.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.216
Got them for Colleen
for our ten-year anniversary.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.385
Made her a music video,
but it's all over, man!

06:19.419 --> 06:21.220
It's over!
Why is that?

06:21.254 --> 06:22.555
'Cause she cheating on me, man!

06:22.589 --> 06:23.855
- Whoa.
- Wait.

06:23.890 --> 06:25.691
Did she... she...
did she tell you that?

06:25.725 --> 06:28.160
Um, but she didn't say anything
about, like, who it might be

06:28.195 --> 06:29.728
or, like, what the person
looks like, right?

06:29.762 --> 06:31.430
Man, I heard her on the phone
talking about

06:31.465 --> 06:33.399
she worried about gettin' a std.

06:33.433 --> 06:35.468
Like she got some kind of thing
called coochie mold.

06:35.502 --> 06:37.436
- What?
- Awesome, dude.

06:37.471 --> 06:40.339
I actually just won a foot race,
so I'm entitled to the best bed.

06:40.373 --> 06:41.773
So is that in the front?

06:41.808 --> 06:44.176
Hey, you can't use this
any more, dummy.

06:44.211 --> 06:46.278
I'm living in there.
Okay, for sure.

06:46.313 --> 06:48.981
Like, what the
happened to my life?

06:49.015 --> 06:50.616
I had it all.

06:50.650 --> 06:52.918
Tell you what, man,
if I catch this dude,

06:52.952 --> 06:55.488
I'm gonna cut his dick off.

06:55.522 --> 06:57.656
I'm just gonna take it
and just rip it.

06:57.690 --> 06:59.125
I'll put it in a microwave

06:59.159 --> 07:00.593
and cook it.
Oh, right.

07:00.627 --> 07:01.860
Yeah, 'cause, like, cheaters.

07:01.894 --> 07:03.462
We hate 'em.
They make me sick.

07:03.497 --> 07:05.197
But you know,
maybe you should treat 'em nice.

07:05.232 --> 07:07.933
I'm gonna go, uh, throw up
'cause I'm so sick

07:07.967 --> 07:09.935
of hearing about
your horrible situation, man.

07:09.969 --> 07:13.305
You okay, Tez?
You seemed bummed, dude.

07:18.211 --> 07:19.612
- Hey, Jillian.
- Hmm?

07:19.646 --> 07:20.912
I got to see Montez's

07:20.947 --> 07:22.448
emergency contact information
right now.

07:22.482 --> 07:24.049
Oh, is there an emergency?

07:24.083 --> 07:27.153
Uh, kind... he's okay.

07:27.187 --> 07:29.921
But kind... yes, kind of.
A little bit.

07:29.956 --> 07:31.657
Well, there needs to be
an emergency, Anders.

07:31.691 --> 07:33.626
Unless...

07:33.660 --> 07:37.329
You let me paint your nails.

07:37.364 --> 07:38.830
Damn it.

07:38.865 --> 07:42.801
Hey, um, Colleen,
this is Anders Holmvik.

07:42.835 --> 07:44.303
We met the other day
in the camping section.

07:44.337 --> 07:46.472
You might remember.
I hope you do.

07:46.506 --> 07:49.542
Anyway, um, you took a picture
of me which was not cool,

07:49.576 --> 07:50.742
and we need to talk about that.

07:50.777 --> 07:53.612
By the way, amazing hand job.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.681
Um, anyway, you know what?
I'll come to you.

07:55.715 --> 07:56.915
Don't... don't even call me back,
okay?

07:56.949 --> 07:58.984
Uh, take care.

07:59.018 --> 08:01.487
I can't have my chick
cuckolding me like this.

08:01.521 --> 08:04.723
Just thinking about this dude
drive me bananas!

08:04.757 --> 08:06.091
Whoo! B-a-n-a-n-a-n-a.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.060
I need... I need to know
who is it, man.

08:08.094 --> 08:10.329
Who is it?
Okay. Fine.

08:10.363 --> 08:12.464
Well, what if we could find out
who it was?

08:12.499 --> 08:13.999
Would you let us
have the rv then?

08:14.033 --> 08:16.034
- Yeah, sleuth. We'll sleuth.
- Sleuth it out.

08:16.069 --> 08:17.403
How y'all gonna do that?

08:17.437 --> 08:19.838
Does she suspect
that you know anything?

08:19.872 --> 08:22.474
Have you been weird to her
a little bit?

08:22.509 --> 08:24.109
Are you a little weird?
No.

08:24.143 --> 08:26.078
I took off in the rv
this morning.

08:26.112 --> 08:27.546
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, there you go.

08:27.581 --> 08:29.381
Right, so, uh,
why don't you tell her

08:29.416 --> 08:31.049
that you went on
a hunting trip, right?

08:31.084 --> 08:34.520
And then... and then when she gets
all, like, horny...

08:34.554 --> 08:37.323
- Yeah, like they always are.
- Like chicks constantly do.

08:37.357 --> 08:39.357
- Yes, constantly juicing.
- Yeah.

08:39.392 --> 08:41.327
And then she invites
her new stud over...

08:41.361 --> 08:43.361
And when he's about
to pound her,

08:43.395 --> 08:46.031
we pound him.

08:46.065 --> 08:48.133
Or you.
Okay, good.

08:48.167 --> 08:51.237
Adam, great call
with the safety harnesses, bud.

08:51.271 --> 08:53.772
- Yeah, right?
- I feel so secure up here.

08:53.806 --> 08:56.442
No, I've actually fallen out
of a lot of trees as a kid,

08:56.476 --> 08:58.444
so I was like,
"we need a safety harness."

08:58.478 --> 09:00.479
You know, a bunch of rope tied
around our waists. That's safe.

09:00.513 --> 09:02.514
- Good call.
- How you doing on that steak?

09:02.549 --> 09:04.516
I'm good for now. I'm
probably gonna want more though.

09:04.551 --> 09:06.084
- Yeah.
- I love steak.

09:06.119 --> 09:07.886
I absolutely love...
we should go on more steak-outs.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.089
- Yeah.
- What... what are you doing?

09:11.124 --> 09:13.959
Well, Blake,
when you have a fine steak,

09:13.993 --> 09:17.730
you got to complement it
with a fine wine, my baby.

09:17.764 --> 09:20.633
Okay, now I have heard that,
but you are eating berries.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.735
Don't be thick, man.
Not with me.

09:22.769 --> 09:24.903
Where do you think
wine comes from?

09:24.937 --> 09:27.273
Berries.
They're little wine balls.

09:27.307 --> 09:30.041
Like a fine "peanut garagio."

09:30.076 --> 09:32.010
Right?
I'm a chef.

09:32.044 --> 09:34.212
Oh, my gosh, dude.
Dude, look.

09:34.247 --> 09:36.649
Look, here he comes.
I'ma call Montez.

09:36.683 --> 09:38.884
- Yeah.
- Montez?

09:38.918 --> 09:41.620
We have our perpetrator.
He is here.

09:41.655 --> 09:43.221
We're... we're looking at him now.

09:43.256 --> 09:44.757
Yeah, don't worry, Tez.
He looks like a bitch.

09:44.791 --> 09:45.791
We're gonna get him, dude.

09:45.825 --> 09:47.192
Yup, yes.
He's on his way.

09:47.226 --> 09:49.628
All right, kick ass.
All right.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:59.439 --> 10:02.609
- Look, babe, the party's over.
- I'm sorry. Party?

10:02.643 --> 10:04.777
Yeah. Wait, oh.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.046
You're gonna act like we didn't
have the best time of our lives?

10:07.081 --> 10:09.048
I'll never forget
how much I ejac'd,

10:09.083 --> 10:10.984
and I'm sure you had a climax
that was unbearable,

10:11.018 --> 10:13.920
even though I didn't even
touch you, but it's gotta stop.

10:13.954 --> 10:15.521
I'm sorry, what do you...
what do you want?

10:15.555 --> 10:17.189
Oh, God, you don't get it.

10:17.224 --> 10:20.526
Look, you gotta delete the photo
from your phone, now.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.062
Right, okay.
Let me get my phone.

10:23.097 --> 10:27.199
Oh, thank you.
I'm just gonna...

10:27.234 --> 10:28.534
all right, so we're gonna

10:28.568 --> 10:30.336
have to get pretty physical
right now.

10:30.370 --> 10:31.670
It's been a long time since
I've gotten physical.

10:31.739 --> 10:33.606
Dude, don't even worry
about it, I brought weapons.

10:33.641 --> 10:35.542
I brought weapons.
Really? Okay.

10:35.576 --> 10:37.210
Look, check it out.
I got a slingshot.

10:37.244 --> 10:38.645
Cool, I'll take that.
I'll take that,

10:38.679 --> 10:39.979
unless you have
a grenade launcher.

10:40.013 --> 10:41.314
Well well,
I have something better.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.782
I have the tetanus ball.

10:42.817 --> 10:44.517
It's a tennis ball
with rusty nails in it.

10:44.552 --> 10:46.018
Okay, I'm gonna want
the slingshot

10:46.053 --> 10:48.187
'cause this looks
pretty  stupid.

10:48.222 --> 10:49.622
What are you...
you're supposed to throw...

10:49.657 --> 10:51.324
how are you gonna pick
that back up, man?

10:51.359 --> 10:53.292
You're gonna... you're gonna
tetanus-ize yourself.

10:53.327 --> 10:55.094
No, no, see, that's what
you're not taking into account.

10:55.128 --> 10:56.830
I have a protector glove
that you wear,

10:56.864 --> 10:59.265
so maybe... maybe you should think
that over before you call...

10:59.299 --> 11:00.933
- very, very smart move.
- Thank you.

11:00.968 --> 11:02.402
But also,
I will take the slingshoot.

11:02.436 --> 11:04.070
Well, no,
I don't think you should

11:04.104 --> 11:05.805
because you don't even know
how to sling-shoot.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.374
Well,
did you see my practice runs?

11:07.408 --> 11:08.842
Well, I did,
and it didn't look right.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.343
No, it looked pretty good.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.644
Okay. You have no ammo,
so you can't...

11:11.679 --> 11:13.045
- give me! Give me!
- No, fine.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.447
- Aah!
- Adam?

11:14.482 --> 11:16.949
Adam?
Oh, oh, my, oh, my...

11:16.984 --> 11:19.018
- help me!
- Adam! Oh, my God!

11:19.052 --> 11:20.953
Help! Help me!

11:20.988 --> 11:22.355
Uh, yeah,
just give me the slingshot.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.592
And hold the back.
Nice try! Cut me down!

11:27.628 --> 11:31.197
All right, just...
well, don't break your neck!

11:31.231 --> 11:33.433
Help!
My friend is choking!

11:33.467 --> 11:34.667
Ders?

11:34.702 --> 11:36.269
Blake?
What are you doing here?

11:36.303 --> 11:38.204
- What? You're the cheater?
- Yeah, I'm the cheater, okay?

11:38.238 --> 11:39.539
At the store the other day,

11:39.573 --> 11:41.608
she gave me
a over-the-pants H.J.

11:41.642 --> 11:44.577
And, dude, you should have seen
what I did in my pants.

11:44.612 --> 11:46.112
- Really?
- Unreal.

11:46.146 --> 11:48.247
I just, like,
barfed out of my thing.

11:48.282 --> 11:49.949
No way.
How many ounces are we talking?

11:49.983 --> 11:52.852
Like a, like a gusher's worth?
Or like a Capri sun?

11:52.887 --> 11:54.487
Like five busts
of I don't know how much.

11:54.522 --> 11:55.988
Oh, that's why you were
wearing ski pants.

11:56.023 --> 11:57.690
You were dealing
with the stain probably.

11:57.725 --> 11:59.258
Dude, now I get it.

11:59.293 --> 12:01.093
Oh!
Adam, Adam!

12:01.128 --> 12:02.995
Adam's choking, he's dying, man.
We got to cut him down.

12:03.030 --> 12:04.330
- What are you talking...
- Come on, come on!

12:04.364 --> 12:05.532
- What?
- Go, go, go!

12:05.566 --> 12:06.933
Get something sharp,
something sharp.

12:06.967 --> 12:08.234
Here, here, here, here,
here, here.

12:08.268 --> 12:09.602
Oh, come on.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

12:09.637 --> 12:11.304
Come on, come on!
He's right through here!

12:11.338 --> 12:12.839
Wait, man, you're not
supposed to run with these.

12:12.873 --> 12:15.074
- I know! No!
- What are you guys doing?

12:15.108 --> 12:16.443
- Just drop the stupid thing!
- Oh, my God.

12:16.477 --> 12:17.877
- Oh, cut him down!
- I got him.

12:17.912 --> 12:19.211
- Cut him down! Come on!
- Adam!

12:19.246 --> 12:21.047
Use some strength, you pussy!

12:21.081 --> 12:22.882
They're not cutting!
I'll be back.

12:22.917 --> 12:26.085
No, no, no!
My little baby!

12:26.119 --> 12:29.923
My little baby! My little angel!

12:29.957 --> 12:32.492
- Oh, my God. I got a big knife!
- Ders, what took you so long?

12:32.526 --> 12:34.226
- I got a big knife! Back up!
- Cut him down!

12:34.261 --> 12:36.162
Oh!

12:37.998 --> 12:39.432
You all right?

12:39.467 --> 12:41.734
- I thought we lost ya.
- Oh, God!

12:41.769 --> 12:43.870
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God! I almost died!

12:43.904 --> 12:45.304
- I know.
- I almost died!

12:45.339 --> 12:47.039
That was so scary!

12:47.074 --> 12:49.108
Thank you for saving me!
It's okay, it's all right.

12:49.142 --> 12:51.310
It's all right.
I had a realization.

12:51.345 --> 12:53.513
I've been alive for 24 years,

12:53.547 --> 12:56.248
and I haven't even done anything
with my life.

12:56.283 --> 12:57.717
- Don't say that. Come on.
- You have too.

12:57.751 --> 12:59.619
- I haven't done anything!
- Come on.

12:59.653 --> 13:02.421
I've never even jet skied
off a waterfall.

13:02.456 --> 13:04.256
- Hey, no one's done that.
- Yeah, not many do.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.059
I've never even hot-air
ballooned around the world.

13:07.094 --> 13:08.795
- It's very expensive.
- Yes.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.430
I've never...

13:11.465 --> 13:15.468
Even seen <i>the expendables.</i>

13:15.503 --> 13:17.770
We did, though.
On Valentine's day.

13:17.805 --> 13:20.640
Whatever the point is,
I need to do more badass stuff!

13:20.674 --> 13:22.909
And watch more classic movies.

13:22.943 --> 13:24.944
I haven't even seen
<i>beauty and the beast</i>

13:24.979 --> 13:27.279
in, like, seven years,
and that was my favorite movie.

13:27.314 --> 13:28.882
- Okay.
- And I'm blowing it!

13:28.916 --> 13:31.718
All right, so what the hell
are you guys doing?

13:31.752 --> 13:33.553
Ders, what are you doing here?

13:33.587 --> 13:34.921
Let's go get this cheater.

13:34.955 --> 13:36.355
Let's go get this cheater
as a team.

13:36.390 --> 13:37.957
- No, Adam, Adam, Adam.
- Team best friends.

13:37.992 --> 13:40.226
Adam, Ders... Ders
is actually the cheater.

13:40.260 --> 13:42.028
He got a hand job
from Montez's pregnant wife.

13:42.062 --> 13:43.863
- Yeah.
- What?

13:43.898 --> 13:45.297
It was this out-of-control,
over-the-pants hand job that...

13:45.332 --> 13:48.200
it was like a tantric
explosion of everything.

13:48.235 --> 13:49.802
- Over the pants, though?
- Yeah.

13:49.837 --> 13:51.838
No, man, that's not
how you want to do it.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.340
What? Wow, dude, has the
Internet melted your brain?

13:54.374 --> 13:56.409
Come on.
Over the pants is fine.

13:56.443 --> 13:58.011
- No way, man.
- Hey!

13:58.045 --> 13:59.812
- You got to go under the pants.
- Y'all find him?

13:59.847 --> 14:01.714
- Uh.
- Um, here.

14:01.749 --> 14:04.183
No, we didn't. He escaped.
He ran away. He was very fast.

14:04.217 --> 14:06.452
Well, what did he look like?
Did you see him?

14:06.486 --> 14:08.154
Actually, no.
We don't know if it's a he,

14:08.188 --> 14:11.357
a she, an it.
We're not sure.

14:11.391 --> 14:13.693
No, look, I could tell you
exactly what he looks like.

14:13.727 --> 14:16.128
And it's about time
you knew too.

14:16.163 --> 14:17.530
- Yes.
- What are you doing, Ders?

14:17.565 --> 14:19.331
I'm doing what's right, okay?

14:19.366 --> 14:21.034
Tez, you're my work friend,
and you deserve to know that...

14:21.068 --> 14:23.703
after the Xzibit concert,
he deserves to know.

14:23.737 --> 14:24.871
Who is it?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.940
Montez, the guy
that's  your wife

14:26.974 --> 14:29.141
is named Karl Hevacheck.

14:29.176 --> 14:31.310
Karl Hevacheck.

14:31.344 --> 14:33.145
- Hevacheck.
- Yeah.

14:42.002 --> 14:44.203
♪ He's insane ah ♪

14:44.237 --> 14:47.139
hmm, now,
I wonder what a rap mu...

14:47.174 --> 14:50.910
"musage" van is?

14:50.945 --> 14:53.780
Karl.
Ooh.

14:53.814 --> 14:55.715
Hey, so what's new, guys?

14:55.749 --> 14:59.953
Welcome to my new life here
in the rap massage van,

14:59.987 --> 15:01.921
where I give homeless people
free bum rubs.

15:01.956 --> 15:04.490
- God, it smells like, uh...
- It's like...

15:04.524 --> 15:06.292
- like...
- Um...

15:06.326 --> 15:09.261
well, it smells like you're
massaging homeless people.

15:09.296 --> 15:11.163
- Yeah, that's...
- That's exactly what it smell...

15:11.198 --> 15:12.699
that's a good way
to describe it.

15:12.733 --> 15:14.400
All right, now look, man,
we got soup kitchens,

15:14.434 --> 15:15.969
places for homeless people
to eat.

15:16.003 --> 15:18.170
But we don't have
massage kitchens,

15:18.205 --> 15:20.740
places for massages
to go down on homeless people.

15:20.774 --> 15:22.508
Hey, Karl,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

15:22.542 --> 15:24.744
but we have an opportunity
for you and it's pressing.

15:24.778 --> 15:27.013
- Shh!
- I'm sorry.

15:27.047 --> 15:29.448
Karl, we'd like to you join us
at the Xzibit concert.

15:29.483 --> 15:31.550
Interested?

15:31.585 --> 15:33.452
I've been thinking a lot
about what you guys said,

15:33.487 --> 15:34.821
and you're absolutely right,
you know.

15:34.855 --> 15:36.789
Trying to find my inner peace.

15:36.824 --> 15:38.157
And right now,
I've kind of found it

15:38.191 --> 15:39.926
in this dude's giant back.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.629
I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it.

15:42.663 --> 15:45.464
So, uh, I'm gonna have to say
na-nay-no, my brothers.

15:45.499 --> 15:47.033
No, Karl.
Come on, dude.

15:47.067 --> 15:48.601
All you got to do is pretend
like you were having sex

15:48.636 --> 15:50.103
with our co-worker's wife,

15:50.137 --> 15:51.838
and then he's probably
gonna beat you up,

15:51.872 --> 15:53.106
just like you wanted.

15:53.140 --> 15:55.474
Can Mike come?

15:55.509 --> 15:57.209
♪ Get down, turn around
show me what you got ♪

15:57.244 --> 16:00.046
♪ you a pow pow juggernaut
take it up a notch ♪

16:00.080 --> 16:01.480
♪ all my guys,
wow, take him out ♪

16:01.515 --> 16:02.849
♪ let me take a shot

16:02.883 --> 16:04.751
there's your boy.

16:07.021 --> 16:09.689
I want you to come here
and see this.

16:09.723 --> 16:12.959
- Who are you calling?
- Is this the dude?

16:12.993 --> 16:15.327
Am I the dude?
Yeah, I'm the dude, man.

16:15.362 --> 16:16.829
I'm the dude, homey.

16:16.864 --> 16:18.164
I'm the one
who's been giving your wife

16:18.198 --> 16:19.866
the stinky , man.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.868
So what are you gonna do?
Just punch me right here, man.

16:21.902 --> 16:23.736
I wanna be your bitch.
Hit him.

16:23.771 --> 16:25.271
- Yup, make him bleed.
- Whoo!

16:25.305 --> 16:27.940
I would like to know what
was she saying about me?

16:27.975 --> 16:29.341
Hold on, what you...
what you say?

16:29.376 --> 16:30.677
I said,
what was she saying about me?

16:30.711 --> 16:32.444
What was she saying about you?
Uh...

16:32.479 --> 16:34.681
Oh, dude, she was saying that
you have a tiny little dick.

16:34.715 --> 16:36.348
All right,
like a tootsie roll, man.

16:36.383 --> 16:37.750
While I have
the Charleston chew,

16:37.785 --> 16:39.285
the king-sized version,

16:39.319 --> 16:40.553
and you know your bitch
has a sweet tooth.

16:40.587 --> 16:42.121
All: Oh!
- He's got him!

16:42.156 --> 16:45.158
Yeah! What's up, now?
Hit me. Hit me, man.

16:45.192 --> 16:49.562
I'm more referring
to her emotional needs.

16:49.596 --> 16:51.397
Emono, there's nothing
emotional about it, man.

16:51.431 --> 16:53.365
You don't get it.
You can't "f" right,

16:53.400 --> 16:55.001
and I gave her
the dunking donut,

16:55.035 --> 16:56.569
and then I had that bitch doing

16:56.603 --> 16:58.571
cirque du soleil
all over the room.

16:58.605 --> 17:00.039
Man, she creamed her panties
for me.

17:00.074 --> 17:01.841
- Oh!
- God damn it!

17:01.875 --> 17:03.109
And guess what
she called me, man.

17:03.143 --> 17:04.343
She called me the king.

17:04.377 --> 17:06.045
I'm king Karl.
Say it, Mike.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.313
- He the king.
- I'm... say it, Mike.

17:07.347 --> 17:08.646
He's the king!

17:08.682 --> 17:10.049
- One more time, Mike.
- He the king!

17:10.084 --> 17:11.317
I'm the king, man.
And guess what.

17:11.351 --> 17:13.285
You just the prince, man.

17:13.319 --> 17:16.288
You prince "mooted."
"Mooted," you a bitch.

17:16.323 --> 17:18.324
Okay? And that baby
in your wife's stomach?

17:18.358 --> 17:20.226
Guess what, man.
Too far.

17:20.260 --> 17:23.662
That's mine, dude.
Sorry, but you're not a daddy.

17:23.696 --> 17:25.231
You're not a daddy.
Now hit me, man.

17:25.265 --> 17:26.799
You know what?
I'm glad you here,

17:26.834 --> 17:28.434
'cause I want you to see this.

17:28.468 --> 17:30.603
Come on, man. You get first.
You get number one.

17:30.637 --> 17:31.904
Come on, Ted.

17:31.939 --> 17:33.172
- Ugh!
- Oh!

17:33.207 --> 17:34.673
Hell, yeah, bitch.

17:34.708 --> 17:37.210
- Okay.
- Yup, you got him. That's it.

17:37.244 --> 17:38.978
- Good to go.
- Oh! Yeah.

17:39.012 --> 17:40.412
Look what you got me doing,
woman!

17:40.447 --> 17:42.181
Look what you got me doing.

17:42.216 --> 17:45.684
- Oh, that's gonna bruise.
- Tez, stop it! Stop it!

17:45.719 --> 17:49.789
I wish I was dead!

17:49.823 --> 17:52.391
Give that... oh! Oh!
Karl, you know...

17:52.425 --> 17:55.228
Karl! Wait!
Tez, I'm the cheater.

17:55.262 --> 17:56.562
What?

17:56.596 --> 17:58.898
Oh, okay.

17:58.932 --> 18:00.833
Oh, Jesus.
This is a dildo.

18:00.868 --> 18:03.870
That's a dildo, guys.
Oh, gross, man.

18:12.431 --> 18:14.566
That's right.
I'm the guy.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.068
Oh, man, that was a rush.
That was great.

18:17.102 --> 18:18.536
I don't need to go
to the concert any more.

18:18.571 --> 18:20.137
Dude, that was a sick mosh.

18:20.172 --> 18:21.606
- Mm-hmm.
- That was awesome.

18:21.640 --> 18:22.807
- Okay, okay.
- Man, it was awesome, bro.

18:22.842 --> 18:24.709
Yeah.
Thanks, Karl.

18:24.744 --> 18:26.811
Right on. See you guys.
Hey, Mike, let's go.

18:26.846 --> 18:29.213
Somebody better tell me what
the hell is going on

18:29.248 --> 18:31.048
'fore I whoop y'all
with this two-headed dilly.

18:31.083 --> 18:34.018
Look, Tez, I had no idea
that Colleen was your wife

18:34.052 --> 18:37.021
when she gave me that standing
H.J. In that store, okay?

18:37.055 --> 18:38.289
- Hand job?
- Yes.

18:38.323 --> 18:39.624
- Over the pants?
- Oh, yeah.

18:39.658 --> 18:41.025
- Standing?
- Mm-hmm.

18:41.059 --> 18:42.560
I mean,
that's all right with us.

18:42.595 --> 18:44.996
All: What?
- That's okay with you guys?

18:45.030 --> 18:46.498
For our ninth anniversary,
I told her she can give

18:46.532 --> 18:48.933
as many hand jobs
over the pants as she wants.

18:48.967 --> 18:50.502
Oh, my God.

18:50.536 --> 18:52.871
You're the perfect wife.
Yeah.

18:52.905 --> 18:54.739
Why, what do you...
what do you get?

18:54.774 --> 18:56.040
Overthe-blouse titty nibbling
in pub.

18:56.074 --> 18:57.575
Titty nibbling?

18:57.610 --> 19:00.211
I would love to titty nibble
in p... okay. Yup, yup.

19:00.245 --> 19:01.780
I applaud your relationship.

19:01.814 --> 19:03.180
I want to get married.
That sounds awesome.

19:03.215 --> 19:04.549
I don't know about all of that.

19:04.583 --> 19:06.150
I have a bone to pick with you,
woman.

19:06.184 --> 19:07.452
I want to know where
you've been sneaking off to

19:07.486 --> 19:08.720
in the middle of the night?

19:08.754 --> 19:10.187
Why are you telling people

19:10.222 --> 19:11.756
you're worried about getting
coochie mold?

19:11.791 --> 19:13.525
Monty, no,
I don't have coochie mold.

19:13.559 --> 19:17.595
I was getting a mold
made of my coochie... For you.

19:17.630 --> 19:20.698
What?

19:20.733 --> 19:22.266
- I'm... I don't know.
- What?

19:22.301 --> 19:25.169
- Ah!
All: Whoa.

19:25.203 --> 19:26.571
Yes, oh, my God.

19:26.605 --> 19:28.873
- Surprise.
- Look at that.

19:28.908 --> 19:30.207
Beautiful, that is beautiful.

19:30.242 --> 19:31.776
Hey,
it's our tenth anniversary.

19:31.811 --> 19:33.545
And I wanted it to be perfect
for you, you know.

19:33.579 --> 19:36.047
When this baby comes,
I'm gonna be sliced open

19:36.081 --> 19:38.750
like a sea bass,
and I want you happy.

19:38.784 --> 19:40.318
That's true.
Babies ruin vaginae.

19:40.352 --> 19:43.220
This is the sexist, freakiest,
most beautiful gift

19:43.255 --> 19:45.389
you have ever gotten me,
but you know what?

19:45.424 --> 19:46.991
We need to quit
this perverted arms race

19:47.025 --> 19:48.392
before somebody gets hurt.

19:48.427 --> 19:50.428
- Oh, are you sure?
- Yeah.

19:50.463 --> 19:53.130
Baby, I don't want to have sex
with this coochie mold.

19:53.165 --> 19:55.032
I want to have sex
with your real coochie

19:55.067 --> 19:56.400
for the rest of my life.

19:56.435 --> 19:59.537
- Aw.
- You know what? Here.

19:59.572 --> 20:01.038
I'm "bequeefing" this to you.

20:01.073 --> 20:02.340
You're queefing this to me?

20:02.374 --> 20:03.875
- Oh, cool.
- Use it well.

20:03.909 --> 20:06.544
Mm, girl, come here.
You about to get tore up.

20:06.579 --> 20:08.245
Montez, you're not a total
piece of.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.881
Man, you're the man.
I got the baby oil.

20:09.915 --> 20:11.649
Go on in there with
your fine ass, girl.

20:11.684 --> 20:14.251
You're my hero, thank you.
This is such a cool thing.

20:14.286 --> 20:15.987
- Hey, hey!
- We were gonna go.

20:16.021 --> 20:17.922
Close the door.

20:17.957 --> 20:20.992
Can we borrow the r...
you said we could...

20:21.026 --> 20:22.627
we're supposed to borrow it
to go to the Xzibit concert?

20:22.661 --> 20:24.462
- Just hurry up.
- Do you remember?

20:24.497 --> 20:25.830
All right, we'll just wait.
We'll wait a little bit.

20:29.869 --> 20:32.003
Well, it's been like an hour.

20:32.037 --> 20:34.005
Should we go get a snack
or something?

20:34.039 --> 20:35.740
Yeah, it's hot, man.
I could go for a drink.

20:37.877 --> 20:40.945
- Whoa!
- Yes. Anything but a squirt.

20:40.980 --> 20:42.780
Nice.
