We move our marrow donor
and our patient...

07:34.454 --> 07:36.890
If the donor has the virus,
his marrow will transmit it

07:36.924 --> 07:37.958
to your

07:37.991 --> 07:39.259
He'll be dead in hours.

But my larger objection is
it won't work.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.946

isn't negative pressure,

08:26.774 --> 08:28.676

08:28.709 --> 08:30.878
We can do the extraction there
but not the transplant.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.616

08:42.389 --> 08:44.892
Once the bone marrow
is extracted,

a highly infectious disease?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.877
That's not something
to worry about.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.546
I either have the virus
or I don't,

10:46.579 --> 10:50.117
and, based on past
national quarantine
mortality rates,

10:50.150 --> 10:53.153
we have a very good
statistical chance
of surviving.

10:55.956 --> 10:59.960
But I didn't know that I would
fall apart the first time,

10:59.993 --> 11:01.729

11:01.762 --> 11:03.964

you're thinking

11:12.639 --> 11:13.707
when you're thinking it?

11:14.507 --> 11:17.510
Yes. It's good to be honest.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.314
Wish my dad was like that.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.185
Dr Park is very honest.
He always shares his opinions.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.620
There's opinions,
and then there's feelings.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.691
Your dad doesn't tell you
that he loves you?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.027
What?

11:35.929 --> 11:37.397
Well, he's just

11:37.430 --> 11:40.333
not really there for us.

11:43.536 --> 11:47.307
He did just risk his life,
and his career,

11:47.340 --> 11:49.509
to break into a quarantine
to help you.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.179

Keep pulmonary edema
to a minimum

12:37.424 --> 12:39.559

fluid management.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.262

Tyler was sweet.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.839
He was a good guy.

out of sight.

is droplet-based,

but he died.

34:51.957 --> 34:52.958
What?

34:56.195 --> 34:57.996

Are you Chris Santos?

35:05.971 --> 35:07.439
My name is Ester.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.911
I was with your father
when he...

35:16.114 --> 35:18.617
He mentioned that he had
lot of regrets.

35:20.819 --> 35:24.055
But it meant a lot to him
that he could help you.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.142
Heard you were a big help
during that delivery.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.478
They needed extra hands.

35:58.424 --> 36:02.961
You asked me why I let
you and your mom go.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.232
Why I didn't fight harder.

36:12.103 --> 36:15.707
It's because I wasn't
a good person.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.710
I wasn't a good father.

36:23.649 --> 36:27.453
My dad had this mantra.

36:27.486 --> 36:29.821
"Be like stone,
never cry."

36:31.957 --> 36:36.295
If I got emotional or upset,
he'd repeat it.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.965
"Be like stone,
never cry."

36:42.067 --> 36:44.370
It made me stronger,

36:44.403 --> 36:46.137
which wasn't always
a good thing.

36:47.339 --> 36:50.509
Spent my life living
behind a wall,

36:50.542 --> 36:53.011
which meant your mom got
to live with that wall

36:53.044 --> 36:55.046
as well, and...

36:58.750 --> 37:00.319
When we split up,

37:00.352 --> 37:03.689
I felt like a failure.

37:07.092 --> 37:11.397
Moving away helped me
hide from that.

My father's voice
is still in my head.

40:09.274 --> 40:10.509
Me neither.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.945
The idea of you
not being around

40:15.080 --> 40:16.715
wasn't okay with me.

drink bourbon with?

I think my bourbon days are
behind me for a little while.

Hi.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.476
You must be exhausted.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.377
And hungry.

40:46.411 --> 40:49.380
All the sandwiches
they gave us
had pickles in them.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.182
Oh, that's no good.

How about we go to that

Yes, we heard.

to your appointment.

How did it go?

41:10.636 --> 41:11.803
I have meningitis.

41:14.906 --> 41:17.208
I have to have surgery
later today

41:17.242 --> 41:19.645
to fix the CSF leak
in my head.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.648
I thought you should know.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.254
That's good.

Meningitis is definitely
not as bad as cancer.
