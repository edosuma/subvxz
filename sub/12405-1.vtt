01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:14.227
USING SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORDSAS YOUR OWN.

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.980

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:16.917
WHEN YOU WEREIN HIGH SCHWHAT? WHY?

01:03:18.043 --> 01:03:19.086
NO ONE ASKED ME.

01:03:20.045 --> 01:03:21.839
I FIND THATHARD TO BELIEVE.

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:22.798
BELIEVE IT.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.175
I WAS NOT ONEOF THE POPULAR KIDS IN SCHOOL.

01:03:25.217 --> 01:03:28.220
ALEX ALLEN, HOLLYWOOD SUPERSTAR,

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.304

01:03:29.346 --> 01:03:30.264
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

01:03:30.305 --> 01:03:32.057
I WAS BULLIED A LOT

01:03:32.099 --> 01:03:34.143
BY SOME OF THE OTHER KIDSIN SCHOOL,

01:03:34.184 --> 01:03:35.728
SO THAT DIDN'T HELP.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:38.564
I JUST REMEMBER SITTINGAT THE LUNCH TABLE,

01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:39.649
LISTENING TO THEM ALL TALK

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:41.817
ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE GOINGTO WEAR TO PROM

01:03:41.859 --> 01:03:44.529
AND WHERE THEY WERE GOINGTO GO OUT FOR DINNER AFTER.

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:46.406
IS THIS GOINGTO BE A SAD STORY?

01:03:46.447 --> 01:03:49.575
