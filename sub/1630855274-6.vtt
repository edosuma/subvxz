WEBVTT

00:13.054 --> 00:15.432
Cheonmyeong's power started
from oxygen.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.601
If the air gets cleaner,
they will lose everything.

00:24.024 --> 00:24.899
<i>Noona.</i>

00:28.278 --> 00:30.071
You sure they're polluting the air
on purpose?

00:30.071 --> 00:31.406
I measured it myself.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.200
CEO RYU SEOK OFF-SITE SCHEDULE

00:34.200 --> 00:35.577
What'll you do now?

00:44.127 --> 00:45.545
<i>Air purification...</i>

00:47.797 --> 00:49.883
Are the physical examinations
going well?

00:49.883 --> 00:53.094
Yes, but more of them are getting exams
without problems,

00:53.094 --> 00:55.555
which makes it a bit more popular
as we proceed.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.895
VACCINATION COMPLETE

01:08.985 --> 01:11.154
<i>Gonna be rough from here on out,</i>

01:11.154 --> 01:13.198
<i>so you do what you feel is right.</i>

01:42.811 --> 01:43.686
Gotcha.

01:45.897 --> 01:46.981
Drop the gun.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.985
I think you should drop the gun.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.288
Here, this way, this way!
This way, here! Over here!

02:03.123 --> 02:04.290
Protect him, quick!

02:06.334 --> 02:07.377
This way!

02:08.419 --> 02:09.629
This way, sir!

02:14.467 --> 02:16.386
Mr. Oh betrayed us.
I'm heading down.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.888
This way! Find the shooter!

02:33.778 --> 02:35.697
I'll get Ryu Seok! Cover me!

03:33.713 --> 03:37.258
BLACK KNIGHT

03:42.931 --> 03:46.017
The kidnappings,
the explosions at the Refugee District,

03:46.017 --> 03:48.436
the truth
behind the air purification vehicles.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.563
In all of this,
Cheonmyeong's been involved.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.984
So should I take care
of all of this privately?

03:57.111 --> 03:58.404
You know I'm a soldier.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.492
I'll solve the case based on
the concrete evidence we discover.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.333
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON RYU SEOK
SUSPECT: 5-8

04:14.879 --> 04:16.172
Our deliverymen?

04:16.965 --> 04:19.550
So the guy shooting at me
and destroying my stations

04:20.843 --> 04:22.845
is one of Cheonmyeong's deliverymen?

04:22.845 --> 04:23.763
Yes.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.515
The explosions and bus hijackings

04:25.515 --> 04:28.226
have been planned out
by our deliverymen, sir.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.729
There is a secret organization
among the deliverymen,

04:31.729 --> 04:33.439
and the mutant is in it.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.066
He's part of that group, sir.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.241
Those bastards get to breathe
because Cheonmyeong allows it.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.828
And they think
that they're superheros, or something?

04:52.166 --> 04:54.544
Chairman Ryu
now knows the truth,

04:54.544 --> 04:56.045
He's meeting the president tomorrow.

04:56.629 --> 05:00.300
So we just hide in our little holes now
until they figure something out?

05:01.551 --> 05:03.136
And what? Cover up the truth?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.763
Even if Ryu Seok's
out of the picture, what changes?

05:06.597 --> 05:07.974
If you keep all of this up,

05:08.558 --> 05:10.727
you might just bring about
uncontrollable chaos.

05:13.354 --> 05:16.065
Preventing chaos sounds
like Ryu Seok's logic.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.192
Refugees getting massacred,

05:18.943 --> 05:21.529
the complete breakdown of the atmosphere.

05:22.947 --> 05:26.159
Has Cheonmyeong's order
brainwashed you a little, Major?

05:38.504 --> 05:40.631
Everything
will be resolved tomorrow.

05:40.631 --> 05:41.799
Be careful.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.426
Okay.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.186
<i>If Chairman Ryu knows,
isn't that it for Ryu Seok?</i>

05:53.186 --> 05:55.146
Yeah, that's what the major thinks.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.231
I think it's worth trusting.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.442
If we wait another day, we'll know more.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.402
I agree. Let's wait.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.404
We'll split up for now.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.975
Dammit! Those sneaky sons of bitches!

06:33.726 --> 06:36.896
<i>Kill your GPS
and stand by in the Refugee Districts.</i>

06:40.191 --> 06:41.609
These are not deliverymen,

06:41.609 --> 06:44.946
they're terrorists who put our company
and our way of life in jeopardy.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.867
You may shoot to kill
starting immediately, understood?

06:50.952 --> 06:52.912
All except for the mutant.
I want him alive.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.122
Yes, sir.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.853
GENERAL DISTRICT 2-4

07:22.150 --> 07:25.445
So there was a reason you were all dying.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.720
So how are you?

07:51.596 --> 07:54.765
Well, just been getting old.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.851
You've aged well.

07:56.851 --> 08:01.355
I would rather stay up here
on the surface and suffer a little bit

08:01.355 --> 08:03.941
than have to move underground
just for air.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.820
Took me five more years
to complete building the Air Core

08:07.820 --> 08:08.863
without you there,

08:09.447 --> 08:12.241
which also delayed
the construction of District A.

08:13.826 --> 08:18.080
If I had been there,
I'd have blown up the Air Core.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.170
Hey, why did you have to raise
such an awful son?

08:24.170 --> 08:27.131
Son takes after the father,
that's the way it is.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.550
This is my burden in life.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.850
The soil is coming back to life
more and more the further south you go.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.228
I heard the air is getting cleaner too.

08:40.811 --> 08:41.938
To hell with District A.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.232
What about leaving the Air Core
and coming back out?

08:44.899 --> 08:46.526
It's still a possibility.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.615
Yes, I have to finish this.

09:09.799 --> 09:13.010
I'm a cleaner, and you're a deliveryman,
so why am I delivering things, huh?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.846
You know that I got let go.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.601
This is the government's Refugee
Reassignment Plan revised by Ryu Seok.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.938
The physical examination is proceeding
according to the revised plan.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.481
It'll be different this time.

09:25.481 --> 09:26.774
And you're sure, right?

09:26.774 --> 09:29.110
Gotta see it to believe it,
or what is this?

09:30.736 --> 09:32.947
You gonna be all paranoid
like that forever?

09:32.947 --> 09:36.284
I'll be less paranoid when the refugees
are in General Districts.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.981
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION COMPLETE
VACCINATION COMPLETE

10:06.981 --> 10:08.941
CHAIRMAN, CHEONMYEONG GROUP
RYU JAE-JIN

10:08.941 --> 10:11.110
PRESIDENT, REPUBLIC OF KOREA
CHAE JIN-GYEONG

10:11.110 --> 10:13.613
<i>The relocation plan led
by the government</i>

10:13.613 --> 10:15.656
<i>will include you, the refugees.</i>

10:15.656 --> 10:17.283
<i>You will be given relocation rights</i>

10:17.283 --> 10:19.410
<i>that will allow you to live
in General Districts.</i>

10:19.410 --> 10:21.996
JOINT AGREEMENT, CHEONMYEONG
WILL ENTRUST TO THE GOVERNMENT

10:21.996 --> 10:24.874
THE RIGHTS TO OXYGEN SUPPLY,
DELIVERY SYSTEM, AND RELOCATION PLAN

10:29.378 --> 10:32.089
I'm very sorry about your son.

10:32.089 --> 10:35.426
I feel as though I'm handing you,
Madam President,

10:35.426 --> 10:38.012
a great burden to carry now.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.149
I never would've thought
you'd do something like this.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.653
The chairman will be giving a statement
about the agreement soon.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.655
I'm gonna miss seeing you around.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.281
Hold on a minute--

10:57.281 --> 10:59.950
You can talk with the defense minister.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.453
You better be going.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.386
The oxygen and delivery system
are the heart of Cheonmyeong.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.887
Why are you giving it away?

11:20.554 --> 11:24.100
It was my goal to create these things
to save people, not to kill them.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.643
What?

11:25.643 --> 11:27.478
I know about what you've done.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.980
You did this.
You made your bed, now lie in it.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.151
There's still time to save this, okay?

11:34.151 --> 11:36.153
But admitting this destroys me.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.155
I am not losing Cheonmyeong this way!

11:38.155 --> 11:41.158
You can't because it was never yours
in the first place.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.328
Oh, Father.

11:50.876 --> 11:55.548
Now it's time to take responsibility
for everything you've done.

11:56.966 --> 12:00.094
Mr. Ryu, you're being placed under arrest
for violating the law.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.057
What?

12:07.601 --> 12:08.686
Arresting me?

12:23.784 --> 12:24.994
What have you done?

12:32.293 --> 12:33.127
Why?

12:34.587 --> 12:37.548
I'm sorry, did that surprise you?

12:39.967 --> 12:42.011
You know I blew up hundreds of refugees.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.679
This shouldn't surprise you.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.283
Take care of your burden right now,
don't put it off on someone else.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.996
Your problem
is not knowing when to stop.

13:08.996 --> 13:12.249
Then make me stop, old man.
Do it! Kill me!

13:12.249 --> 13:15.544
You think
I can't pull this trigger right now?

13:46.784 --> 13:47.910
Oh, Father.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.374
Mr. Ryu...

13:58.838 --> 14:00.631
the last step of the plan is the coup.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.467
We'll capture the president first.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.872
GENERAL DISTRICTS
REFUGEE REASSIGNMENT PLAN

14:40.629 --> 14:41.797
What's that?

14:43.007 --> 14:44.758
The Refugee Reassignment Plans.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.427
- Oh.
- Not sure I trust it.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.346
I think you should believe it this time.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.975
Yesterday Chairman Ryu came by.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.980
He personally promised
we'll go to the General Districts.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.608
- He was here?
- The announcement will be made soon.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.245
Sir, uh...

15:14.455 --> 15:15.289
Huh?

15:21.795 --> 15:22.755
<i>I, Ryu Seok,</i>

15:24.381 --> 15:26.634
<i>will carry on
the late Chairman Ryu's will</i>

15:27.801 --> 15:29.136
<i>and lead Cheonmyeong</i>

15:30.095 --> 15:31.931
<i>with dedication and devotion.</i>

15:34.141 --> 15:37.728
All high-ranking officers are summoned
to the defense minister's office.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.606
What?

15:40.606 --> 15:43.233
<i>I also promise
to arrest every one of the deliverymen.</i>

15:43.233 --> 15:45.152
Are they attempting to stage a coup?

15:45.152 --> 15:47.696
<i>They're disrupting our citizen's safety,</i>

15:48.280 --> 15:50.866
<i>they're destroying facilities
and attempting assassinations</i>

15:50.866 --> 15:53.577
<i>alongside the Defense Ministry,
and are considered terrorists.</i>

15:54.161 --> 15:55.955
All deliveries will be halted

15:57.665 --> 16:00.167
until every terrorist has been arrested.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.212
<i>We ask for your understanding</i>...

16:04.213 --> 16:06.757
<i>...in dealing
with this troubling situation.</i>

16:09.385 --> 16:10.886
We've got one option...

16:13.555 --> 16:15.808
go to the Core District immediately.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.403
The Core District's blueprint.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.155
Chairman Ryu and I created it.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.868
I always hoped I'd never have to use it.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.331
Thank you for it.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.377
<i>These are wanted terrorists.</i>

16:43.377 --> 16:46.422
<i>Deliveries to all districts
will be completely halted</i>

16:46.422 --> 16:48.882
<i>until all 12 deliverymen
have been arrested.</i>

16:56.473 --> 16:58.434
CHEONMYEONG LOGISTICS

17:07.943 --> 17:11.822
<i>Cheonmyeong Group and the government
will send supplies to each district.</i>

17:11.822 --> 17:14.241
<i>Please check when and where
the supplies will be delivered.</i>

17:14.825 --> 17:18.537
<i>We ask for your full cooperation
in order to minimize any confusion.</i>

17:43.395 --> 17:44.396
Right here.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.987
<i>We ask that all refugees
at the Physical Examination Center</i>

18:33.987 --> 18:35.405
<i>for the relocation plan</i>

18:35.405 --> 18:38.450
<i>stand in line to register
your personal information first.</i>

18:39.159 --> 18:42.913
<i>The comprehensive vaccine was created
by Cheonmyeong Pharmaceuticals</i>

18:42.913 --> 18:44.957
<i>in consideration
of the weakened immune system</i>

18:44.957 --> 18:46.458
<i>and health of refugees.</i>

18:46.458 --> 18:49.795
<i>The vaccine has undergone a thorough range
of clinical trials and tests</i>

18:49.795 --> 18:51.672
<i>to prove its safety and efficacy.</i>

18:51.672 --> 18:54.299
It's about time they start dying, right?

18:54.967 --> 18:59.012
Yes, sir. Should be taking effect now
that we've passed the incubation stage.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.236
What in the world is going on?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.238
It seems to be a contagion.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.490
We're moving
to the General Districts soon.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.076
It's awful
right before getting out of here.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.036
A contagion?

19:25.664 --> 19:26.790
Useless,

19:27.916 --> 19:29.751
it... it's the physical examination!

19:30.335 --> 19:31.170
What?

19:34.506 --> 19:35.507
Huh?

19:36.091 --> 19:37.968
- Oh my God.
- What?

19:37.968 --> 19:40.345
The dummys went
to get their physical exam.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.346
Huh?

20:13.420 --> 20:15.047
Sir, what is it? What's the matter?

20:17.257 --> 20:20.636
Uh, don't do the physical examination...

20:20.636 --> 20:22.638
Don't let them do
the physical exam on you.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.557
If they give you the vaccine,

20:26.141 --> 20:27.100
you will die!

20:38.153 --> 20:39.863
4-1: THE VACCINE WILL KILL YOU

20:42.074 --> 20:43.533
Dammit!

20:43.533 --> 20:45.702
<i>We have to stop it,
whatever it takes.</i>

20:54.461 --> 20:57.089
Wow,
so all you need to do is get a shot?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.174
Just a little prick
and that's it, right?

20:59.758 --> 21:01.093
Everyone, wait! Stop!

21:01.093 --> 21:02.719
You can't go in there!

21:03.303 --> 21:05.305
- You'll die if you get the shot!
- Who are you?

21:05.305 --> 21:08.642
You'll die if you get the shot!
I've checked!

21:08.642 --> 21:10.060
Dummy, Dumb-dumb!

21:10.060 --> 21:12.104
You guys, get out of there right now!

21:12.104 --> 21:14.064
Huh? What's with him?

21:14.064 --> 21:16.483
Everybody,
get out of there!

21:18.235 --> 21:19.736
- Useless!
- Useless!

21:19.736 --> 21:20.737
Don't move!

21:20.737 --> 21:22.239
Whoa, whoa!

21:22.239 --> 21:24.783
<i>I'm at the physical exam center.</i>

21:24.783 --> 21:25.784
<i>I'll get started.</i>

21:50.434 --> 21:53.020
<i>Terrorists are appearing
at physical examination centers</i>

21:53.020 --> 21:54.396
<i>around the districts.</i>

21:54.396 --> 21:56.356
<i>Heighten security and kill on sight.</i>

21:56.982 --> 21:57.983
Don't move!

21:58.483 --> 22:00.569
Who are you? Identify yourself!

22:01.069 --> 22:03.155
What? Why is he there?

22:05.115 --> 22:06.116
Shit!

22:42.736 --> 22:44.237
Don't come over here!

22:46.406 --> 22:48.200
Stop! Don't...

23:00.670 --> 23:01.505
Useless.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.256
Useless.

23:03.924 --> 23:06.134
Useless!

23:06.968 --> 23:08.220
Useless!

23:12.015 --> 23:13.517
No.

23:16.019 --> 23:17.312
Go. Run away.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.607
Don't let them capture you, okay?

23:21.358 --> 23:22.943
Hey, U--

23:23.860 --> 23:24.861
Useless!

23:25.570 --> 23:26.405
Run...

23:27.781 --> 23:28.657
Useless.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.033
Useless!

23:30.784 --> 23:32.577
Useless! Oh, God!

23:33.078 --> 23:35.038
Useless, no!

23:36.123 --> 23:37.040
Useless.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.584
Useless!

23:46.550 --> 23:48.510
- Sa-wol!
- Useless!

23:48.510 --> 23:50.429
- Yoon Sa-wol!
- Useless!

24:02.441 --> 24:04.609
The mutant deliveryman's been arrested.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.653
He'll be sent here.

24:06.653 --> 24:07.737
Good.

24:07.737 --> 24:10.073
The vaccine plan has failed
due to the attack

24:10.073 --> 24:12.534
on the physical examination centers.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.743
Minister.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.832
Let's just wipe them all out.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.835
It'd be easier that way.

24:27.799 --> 24:28.633
Major...

24:30.552 --> 24:32.304
they've just arrested your brother.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.472
Sa-wol?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.307
They're transporting him
to Cheonmyeong now.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.349
Cheonmyeong?

24:37.476 --> 24:38.727
Just give us the order, Major.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.315
We're ready to move out.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.901
No orders, but...

24:47.486 --> 24:48.570
there is one thing.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.003
Good luck, my friends.

25:05.795 --> 25:06.838
Just be careful.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.468
Who's there?

25:25.899 --> 25:27.901
Did you hear about Yoon Sa-wol?

25:27.901 --> 25:31.404
Yes, he should be
at Cheonmyeong's office by now.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.198
We're going to get him back.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.158
We're headed
to the same destination.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.577
I'll show you the way.

26:35.135 --> 26:37.387
<i>Did you help me
because I'm a mutant?</i>

26:37.387 --> 26:40.307
<i>No, I did it because you were
an immature refugee kid</i>

26:40.307 --> 26:42.100
<i>who didn't know what the world was like.</i>

26:42.892 --> 26:44.227
<i>What does that mean?</i>

26:47.355 --> 26:50.942
<i>You asked what was different about
the Special District residents, right?</i>

26:50.942 --> 26:52.902
<i>You said they were born there.</i>

27:00.493 --> 27:03.413
<i>So what do you think about people
who live and die miserably</i>

27:03.413 --> 27:05.415
<i>just because they're refugees?</i>

27:05.415 --> 27:08.251
<i>Refugees are people too.
They live and breathe.</i>

27:08.251 --> 27:09.419
<i>That's unfair.</i>

27:11.713 --> 27:15.050
<i>Cheonmyeong wants anyone born
as a refugee to die.</i>

27:15.050 --> 27:17.177
<i>That's how it's gone so far,</i>

27:17.177 --> 27:18.720
<i>and will continue to go.</i>

27:25.477 --> 27:27.520
<i>That is the world you're living in now.</i>

27:30.023 --> 27:31.650
<i>We're attempting to change that.</i>

28:57.527 --> 28:59.988
<i>There's only one way
into the Core District.</i>

30:16.856 --> 30:17.899
We'll go to the president.

30:44.634 --> 30:48.137
It's a direct transfusion,
so there may be side effects.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.764
How are you feeling?

30:50.473 --> 30:52.058
A little bit weird, yeah.

30:52.725 --> 30:53.935
It's mutant blood.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.751
- Sir.
- What is it?

31:18.751 --> 31:20.044
Have a look.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.107
I think it'd be safest
to stay here for now, sir.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.692
What are they doing?

31:42.692 --> 31:44.068
Where's Mr. Oh?

31:46.529 --> 31:48.531
Crashed down through the sky?

31:54.287 --> 31:55.538
What just happened?

31:59.334 --> 32:00.168
Who's there?

32:00.168 --> 32:02.587
Who do you think?
I'm the deliveryman here to get you.

32:16.225 --> 32:18.436
<i>Initiating emergency power system.</i>

32:24.484 --> 32:26.402
How does this make any sense?

32:26.903 --> 32:29.072
They must've found a blueprint.

32:29.072 --> 32:31.866
They've cut off the main line
to the Core District.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.870
Get me Defense.

32:36.454 --> 32:37.830
<i>He's with the president now.</i>

33:38.641 --> 33:39.475
Gun.

34:07.086 --> 34:09.005
Who do you think it is?

34:09.005 --> 34:11.466
I'm looking forward
to seeing who it is as well.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.280
Minister,

34:34.280 --> 34:36.199
you're under arrest for treason.

34:57.345 --> 35:00.139
<i>This is Major Jung Seol-ah
of the Defense Intelligence Command!</i>

35:00.139 --> 35:02.433
<i>The defense minister
has been placed under arrest.</i>

35:03.476 --> 35:06.229
<i>Insurgents,
drop your weapons and surrender.</i>

35:10.358 --> 35:13.402
I repeat.
The defense minister is under arrest.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.322
Insurgents,
drop your weapons and surrender.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.703
This is not how everything ends.

35:47.186 --> 35:50.064
<i>Air Core energy overloading.</i>

35:59.949 --> 36:01.993
<i>Air Core energy overloading.</i>

36:01.993 --> 36:04.620
<i>Evacuate. Air Core energy...</i>

36:18.217 --> 36:19.218
Come out here!

36:21.512 --> 36:23.848
Isn't the brat important to you as well?

36:28.561 --> 36:29.645
Yes, he is.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.868
Killing yourself is the best you got?

36:44.452 --> 36:47.496
I'm not letting
the refugee, vermin scum have this.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.624
I'll decide how to end things.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.043
You massacred the refugees,

36:52.043 --> 36:54.420
you polluted the atmosphere,

36:55.421 --> 36:57.798
you conducted experiments on kids.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.220
Your death won't bring forgiveness.

37:02.803 --> 37:05.306
I'm not looking for forgiveness from you,

37:06.224 --> 37:07.808
5-8.

37:08.809 --> 37:10.895
It's impossible to satisfy everybody.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.398
But I had a job to do.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.414
<i>Unable to control energy supply.</i>

37:38.047 --> 37:39.632
It's all over.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.437
You don't get to decide that.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.858
<i>Unable to control energy supply.</i>

37:57.858 --> 37:59.527
<i>Emergency evacuation.</i>

37:59.527 --> 38:01.445
<i>The Air Core will explode.</i>

39:45.216 --> 39:47.802
<i>The construction of District A
is now complete</i>

39:47.802 --> 39:49.678
<i>and we will begin relocation.</i>

39:50.346 --> 39:52.640
Refugees will be relocated in order

39:52.640 --> 39:54.683
according to the date
on their registration.

39:55.601 --> 40:00.439
<i>And the government will do its best to
facilitate a safe and speedy relocation.</i>

40:00.439 --> 40:03.234
<i>The government will also remove
the status system</i>

40:03.234 --> 40:07.321
<i>classifying people into refugee,
general, special, and core citizens,</i>

40:07.321 --> 40:10.658
<i>and reform the residential
and oxygen supply system.</i>

40:10.658 --> 40:12.201
<i>We will never cease working</i>

40:12.201 --> 40:17.289
<i>to ensure that every Korean citizen
can live equally without discrimination.</i>

40:51.323 --> 40:54.243
THREE MONTHS LATER

41:11.385 --> 41:13.053
<i>Disinfection complete.</i>

41:14.972 --> 41:16.640
Ugh! Why are you so late?

41:20.269 --> 41:22.605
When am I allowed
to go back to work already?

41:23.397 --> 41:25.524
It's imprisonment.
I'm going crazy in here.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.526
You complain a lot.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.404
You still got more to learn.

41:33.115 --> 41:34.658
Shouldn't you check ID?

41:36.994 --> 41:38.537
Oh, right.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.256
Doesn't the air feel cleaner?

41:57.139 --> 41:59.183
Sky's getting much clearer as well.

44:53.315 --> 44:58.320
