Minds: Beyond Borders"...

00:02.562 --> 00:05.570
- Ryan, are you headed off?
- Like father, like son.

00:06.414 --> 00:08.681
Cole! You know this agente?

00:09.179 --> 00:12.417
Did four years at Lompoc
'cause of this Fed.

00:12.429 --> 00:15.234
Don't recall. All you
dirtbags look the same to me.

00:18.232 --> 00:19.747
Stupid move, Cole.

00:19.771 --> 00:21.966
Why didn't I get a
deconfliction notification

00:22.013 --> 00:24.060
from FBI Headquarters
that you were here, Ryan?

00:24.091 --> 00:26.269
'Cause it was on a
need-to-know basis, Dad,

00:26.308 --> 00:27.176
and you didn't need to know.

00:27.230 --> 00:28.926
Well, if I did, we wouldn't
have blown your cover.

00:29.043 --> 00:31.478
If things go sideways in
an undercover investigation,

00:31.513 --> 00:33.480
there's a contingency
plan to save cover.

00:33.515 --> 00:35.082
Why are you taking the toughest,

00:35.116 --> 00:37.317
most dangerous road
there is in the Bureau?

00:37.352 --> 00:39.386
I'm asking you to see
me as a fellow agent,

00:39.421 --> 00:41.588
not as your son. I need
to get back undercover now.

00:41.623 --> 00:44.558
His name is Cole Dabb, and
we got him on possession,

00:44.592 --> 00:46.193
intent to distribute,

00:46.227 --> 00:48.262
assault and battery of a federal agent.

00:48.296 --> 00:51.064
He's your problem now.

00:54.077 --> 00:56.403
Over 68 million Americans

00:56.438 --> 00:59.239
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

00:59.274 --> 01:00.841
If danger strikes,

01:00.875 --> 01:03.076
the FBI's International Response Team

01:03.111 --> 01:05.379
is called into action.

01:27.235 --> 01:30.103
That was the best meal I've had yet.

01:30.138 --> 01:31.572
Athens is amazing.

01:31.606 --> 01:33.140
Finally, I got you out of New York.

01:33.174 --> 01:34.942
It's good to have you here, cousin.

01:34.976 --> 01:36.477
You know, my dad would
have gotten a kick

01:36.511 --> 01:38.245
about what you did with the restaurant.

01:38.279 --> 01:39.613
Wish he was here.

01:39.647 --> 01:41.148
To family, ah?

01:41.182 --> 01:42.149
Family.

01:42.183 --> 01:43.717
Yamas.

01:46.254 --> 01:50.224
Ah! Looks like that
little boy got a toy boat

01:50.258 --> 01:51.258
for his Name Day.

01:51.292 --> 01:54.294
Bravo. You're really
picking up on our customs.

01:54.329 --> 01:56.230
You're gonna be a native soon.

01:56.264 --> 01:58.332
I might be from Queens,
but I'm still Greek, man.

01:58.366 --> 02:01.101
- Ah.
- There's Uncle Elias.

02:01.135 --> 02:02.936
I've been trying to talk to him all day.

02:02.971 --> 02:05.772
Be right back, okay?

02:05.807 --> 02:07.841
Got a minute?

02:07.876 --> 02:08.976
So I had a look at the books,

02:09.009 --> 02:12.246
and I think I found a way
to streamline our expenses.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.282
_

02:15.375 --> 02:16.979
_

02:17.894 --> 02:20.315
_

02:20.488 --> 02:22.990
Uncle, could you speak in English?

02:23.024 --> 02:25.325
Sorry, I just... I don't understand.

02:28.229 --> 02:30.264
You understand that?

02:30.298 --> 02:32.966
- Huh? Get out.
- What the hell?!

02:33.040 --> 02:34.829
_

02:39.307 --> 02:42.142
Sorry. Just... just
let him cool off, huh?

02:42.645 --> 02:43.941
_

02:44.098 --> 02:47.035
_

02:47.315 --> 02:49.182
_

02:52.887 --> 02:56.056
- Papa has a lot on his mind.
- Maybe I came on too strong.

02:56.090 --> 02:58.089
No, just forget it,
okay? He'll come around.

02:58.187 --> 02:59.167
Okay.

02:59.222 --> 03:03.363
I love you. Go home. Get some rest, huh?

03:03.398 --> 03:05.699
- You sure?
- I got this covered.

03:24.419 --> 03:26.687
Not funny, Leo.

03:31.726 --> 03:33.260
That was delicious.

03:33.294 --> 03:34.928
Thank you.

03:34.963 --> 03:36.096
Question.

03:36.130 --> 03:37.364
Go for it.

03:37.398 --> 03:39.066
Have you talked to Ryan lately?

03:42.604 --> 03:45.706
No. Why?

03:45.740 --> 03:48.675
He missed my birthday.
He's never done that before.

03:48.710 --> 03:51.345
I'm sure he has a very
good reason, but...

03:51.379 --> 03:53.513
is there something I should know?

04:01.656 --> 04:03.290
It was just so much easier

04:03.324 --> 04:04.191
when it was just you in the field.

04:04.225 --> 04:05.892
Now I have to worry about both of you.

04:05.927 --> 04:08.962
I don't want you
worrying about anything.

04:15.336 --> 04:17.036
Duty calls.

04:17.071 --> 04:19.839
Yeah.

04:21.509 --> 04:22.442
Be safe.

04:25.446 --> 04:28.382
Good morning, team. Here's what we got.

04:28.416 --> 04:30.884
U.S. Ambassador in Athens
asked the IRT to investigate

04:30.918 --> 04:33.487
the murder of 26-year-old Paul Stavros

04:33.521 --> 04:35.222
of Astoria, Queens, New York.

04:35.256 --> 04:37.324
His body was found in an alley
in the Longratis district.

04:37.358 --> 04:39.292
5 miles from where he was last seen

04:39.327 --> 04:40.360
at his family's restaurant.

04:40.395 --> 04:42.763
Longratis is one of the
roughest areas in Athens.

04:42.797 --> 04:45.499
High crime rate, pickpockets,
armed robberies are common.

04:45.533 --> 04:47.234
Well, it doesn't look like robbery.

04:47.268 --> 04:49.653
Paul was found still wearing his watch.

04:49.685 --> 04:50.685
Expensive.

04:50.848 --> 04:51.938
But the face is cracked.

04:51.973 --> 04:53.407
Maybe that's why it wasn't stolen.

04:53.441 --> 04:55.475
But it'd be easy to repair and sell

04:55.510 --> 04:57.611
for at least 200 Euros.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.780
Well, that would go
a long way in Athens,

04:59.814 --> 05:02.749
considering Greece has the
highest poverty rate in the E.U.

05:02.784 --> 05:04.351
Well, according to the
preliminary autopsy,

05:04.385 --> 05:07.087
Paul was beaten to death,
and by the looks of it,

05:07.121 --> 05:09.289
it's with some sort of blunt weapon.

05:09.323 --> 05:11.425
Uh, local authorities
put the time of death

05:11.459 --> 05:13.927
at 48 hours prior to his
body being found in Longratis.

05:13.961 --> 05:15.862
So he was abducted two days ago,

05:15.897 --> 05:18.198
but he was never reported
as a missing person.

05:18.232 --> 05:19.332
That's odd.

05:19.367 --> 05:20.534
And suspicious, especially since

05:20.568 --> 05:22.202
he was last seen with his relatives.

05:22.236 --> 05:24.337
Paul had recently arrived to Athens.

05:24.372 --> 05:27.340
His declaration form says
that he was in town for work.

05:27.375 --> 05:29.644
It's a business deal gone bad?

05:29.706 --> 05:32.713
Witnesses saw his uncle, Elias Stavros,

05:32.747 --> 05:33.847
throw a wine bottle at him.

05:33.881 --> 05:36.650
That was enough for local
police to make an arrest.

05:36.684 --> 05:37.851
That would explain why his family

05:37.885 --> 05:39.519
didn't report him as being MIA.

05:39.554 --> 05:41.121
I'll look into Elias' background,

05:41.155 --> 05:43.557
see if the family business
was the source of their issues.

05:43.591 --> 05:44.391
Paul's record was clean.

05:44.425 --> 05:46.526
Same isn't true for his relatives.

05:46.561 --> 05:49.696
Looks like the Stavros family
has a lengthy criminal past

05:49.731 --> 05:53.300
of felonies, assaults,
battery, thefts, DUIs.

05:53.334 --> 05:54.401
The list goes on an on.

05:54.435 --> 05:57.904
Paul's hot-headed uncle
have a checkered past, too?

05:57.939 --> 05:59.306
Looks like it.

05:59.340 --> 06:01.170
Well, if he has a
propensity for violence,

06:01.256 --> 06:04.044
it's possible that he resolved
the conflict with his nephew

06:04.078 --> 06:05.312
the old-fashioned way.

06:05.346 --> 06:08.715
Maybe Elias Stavros decided to
prune the last American branch

06:08.750 --> 06:10.550
off his family tree.

06:15.801 --> 06:19.868

however much we have suffered

06:41.719 --> 06:45.122
Monty, what have you been able
to dig up on Mr. Elias Stavros?

06:45.156 --> 06:47.090
Well, there was a lot of bad blood

06:47.125 --> 06:49.093
between Paul's father
and uncle for years.

06:49.132 --> 06:50.647
What caused the hostility?

06:50.734 --> 06:52.702
Multiple lawsuits over the ownership

06:52.736 --> 06:53.903
of the Stavros' restaurant.

06:53.938 --> 06:55.705
Paul inherited his late father's

06:55.739 --> 06:57.540
disputed financial
stake in the business.

06:57.575 --> 06:59.042
And with Paul out of the picture,

06:59.076 --> 07:00.376
Elias has sole ownership.

07:00.411 --> 07:03.980
Well, times are dire in Athens.
Many businesses have shuttered.

07:04.014 --> 07:05.782
Profits aren't what they used to be.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.650
Not having a share in
the restaurant's earnings

07:07.685 --> 07:08.918
would definitely benefit Elias.

07:08.953 --> 07:10.787
Thanks, Monty.

07:10.821 --> 07:13.256
Mae, you stay here and start
the supplemental autopsy.

07:13.290 --> 07:14.891
The body will be delivered soon.

07:14.925 --> 07:17.827
Simmons, retrace Paul's last steps.

07:17.862 --> 07:20.647
Clara and I will head
to the crime scene.

07:27.304 --> 07:29.839
Thanks.

07:29.874 --> 07:32.242
Thank you for coming, Agent Garrett.

07:32.276 --> 07:34.744
Sergeant Balaban, this is Agent Seger.

07:34.778 --> 07:38.147
Hello. The FBI's help
is greatly appreciated.

07:38.182 --> 07:39.616
We found Paul Stavros' body here.

07:39.650 --> 07:41.951
You know, dumping a body
like this in public...

07:41.986 --> 07:44.254
It's a brazen act.
Whoever this killer is,

07:44.288 --> 07:46.856
they're not worried about
being caught by authorities

07:46.891 --> 07:48.491
or the body being discovered.

07:48.525 --> 07:50.860
We think Elias Stavros
disposed of the body here

07:50.895 --> 07:52.428
to try to throw us off.

07:52.463 --> 07:54.497
Leaving his nephew in
such a dangerous area

07:54.531 --> 07:57.433
makes it look like some
street thug killed him.

07:57.468 --> 07:58.935
Yeah, but there were witnesses

07:58.969 --> 08:00.436
that saw Elias and Paul fighting.

08:00.471 --> 08:01.404
He must have known

08:01.438 --> 08:03.101
he'd be considered a
suspect in his murder.

08:03.140 --> 08:05.452
Doesn't make sense if
the motive was personal.

08:05.499 --> 08:07.944
Has Elias Stavros made
an admission of guilt?

08:07.978 --> 08:11.281
No. And he's been less than cooperative

08:11.315 --> 08:13.049
with my investigators.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.852
Suspicious behavior for someone
who claims to be innocent.

08:15.886 --> 08:18.354
- Where is he now?
- Police headquarters.

08:18.389 --> 08:21.324
- We need to talk to him.
- Of course.

08:25.529 --> 08:29.465
- How'd you hurt your hands?
- I burned them on a pot.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.068
I work in a restaurant. Stuff happens.

08:32.102 --> 08:35.238
I have nothing to do
with my nephew's death.

08:35.272 --> 08:37.073
Why would I harm him?

08:37.107 --> 08:38.975
Well, you probably weren't thrilled

08:39.009 --> 08:40.876
when he stuck his nose in your business.

08:40.910 --> 08:43.345
Maybe you got rid of
him to maintain control

08:43.436 --> 08:44.870
of the restaurant.

08:47.084 --> 08:49.452
Why didn't you alert the
police when Paul went missing?

08:51.588 --> 08:53.823
You can sit there all day if
you want to keep stonewalling,

08:53.857 --> 08:55.491
but you're not gonna get rid of us

08:55.526 --> 08:57.126
until we get some answers.

09:01.432 --> 09:04.600
I didn't go to the police
because I assumed he'd gone home

09:04.635 --> 09:08.171
and was avoiding me so we
didn't have another argument.

09:08.205 --> 09:10.039
Besides, Paul's a grown man.

09:10.074 --> 09:13.242
I didn't think it necessary
to question his whereabouts.

09:15.079 --> 09:19.415
I swear to God, I didn't hurt my nephew.

09:19.450 --> 09:23.920
But you do have a police
record for being violent.

09:23.954 --> 09:28.469
That was years ago. I was
only protecting my sister.

09:28.578 --> 09:29.959
That guy was assaulting her.

09:29.994 --> 09:32.061
Were you protecting Paul when
you threw a bottle at him?

09:32.096 --> 09:33.396
It's probably similar to the bottle

09:33.430 --> 09:34.931
that you beat him to death with.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.100
No, no, no.

09:37.134 --> 09:39.435
I threw it because I was
upset about something else

09:39.470 --> 09:41.204
and took it out on the boy.

09:41.238 --> 09:43.172
What were you so angry about?

09:47.411 --> 09:50.283
I didn't speak to my brother for years

09:51.682 --> 09:54.584
because of a stupid
disagreement over our restaurant.

09:58.255 --> 10:00.306
Now he's gone.

10:01.158 --> 10:04.227
I'm mad at myself, not my nephew.

10:06.096 --> 10:07.797
Paul is...

10:09.800 --> 10:15.505
... was a constant reminder
of my damn stupidity.

10:15.539 --> 10:19.609
So if you didn't kill him, who did?

10:28.519 --> 10:31.087
You're not telling us everything.

10:31.121 --> 10:34.123
You have nothing on me. Let me go.

10:34.158 --> 10:38.161
Sure... as soon as you cooperate.

10:38.195 --> 10:41.064
Until then, get comfortable.

10:47.838 --> 10:51.808
Did you see the fight
between your uncle and Paul?

10:51.842 --> 10:53.543
According to the schedule,
the altercation occurred

10:53.577 --> 10:55.111
in the area where you were working.

10:55.145 --> 10:57.146
Seems weird you didn't
notice any commotion.

10:57.181 --> 11:00.016
Then it must have happened
while I was on break. Excuse me.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.285
Listen, I've talked to
almost the entire staff.

11:02.319 --> 11:04.287
No one seems to have seen anything.

11:04.321 --> 11:05.721
Are you protecting your uncle?

11:05.756 --> 11:08.224
No. Sorry, I can't help you.

11:08.258 --> 11:11.160
I really need to get back to work.

11:13.697 --> 11:15.998
Hey, Mae, did you find anything?

11:16.033 --> 11:17.456
Why, yes, I did.

11:17.518 --> 11:20.536
Subdermal photography revealed
that Paul wasn't attacked

11:20.571 --> 11:22.972
with a bottle or with any other weapon.

11:23.006 --> 11:24.173
Then how'd he die?

11:24.208 --> 11:26.075
The killer used his bare-knuckled fist

11:26.110 --> 11:27.577
to beat him to death.

11:27.611 --> 11:29.078
Beating someone to a pulp

11:29.113 --> 11:30.079
takes a lot of effort.

11:30.114 --> 11:33.063
Yeah, I've never seen a
body beaten this badly.

11:33.125 --> 11:37.019
Shattered eye sockets,
broken jaw, crushed larynx.

11:37.054 --> 11:38.921
It's fractured ribs, ruptured spleen,

11:38.956 --> 11:40.590
lacerations on both of his hands.

11:40.624 --> 11:42.658
Killer must be a big
guy, physically fit enough

11:42.693 --> 11:44.494
to deliver such blows
over and over again.

11:44.528 --> 11:47.096
Yeah, this is a punishing pounding.

11:47.131 --> 11:50.233
He left multiple impressions
of his fists on the body.

11:50.267 --> 11:52.068
That's a lot of anger. Seems personal.

11:52.102 --> 11:57.106
And get this. Clara said Elias'
hands were all scraped up.

11:57.141 --> 11:59.742
Elias Stavros is looking
good for this more and more.

11:59.776 --> 12:00.776
Exactly.

12:00.811 --> 12:03.446
Well, the good thing is,
I found skin and blood

12:03.480 --> 12:06.582
under Paul's fingernails, so
I'm gonna send that to Monty,

12:06.617 --> 12:09.118
have him run it through
CODIS and Interpol,

12:09.153 --> 12:12.121
and hopefully we will get a
hit to confirm Elias' guilt.

12:12.156 --> 12:15.591
Oh, and since you are
tracking Paul's last steps,

12:15.626 --> 12:17.627
I might have a lead for you.

12:17.661 --> 12:19.629
That's good, 'cause no
one here's willing to talk.

12:19.663 --> 12:22.565
There were traces of
urine and cleaning products

12:22.599 --> 12:25.301
in Paul's hair and
embedded in his scalp,

12:25.335 --> 12:26.202
as if...

12:26.236 --> 12:29.205
He was dragged across
the bathroom floor.

12:49.259 --> 12:51.227
Well, that's probably how
the killer entered and exited

12:51.261 --> 12:53.062
without being seen.

13:02.339 --> 13:05.274
I'm Agent Simmons, FBI.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.891
Leo Stavros.

13:07.114 --> 13:08.899
I'm investigating the
death of your cousin.

13:08.946 --> 13:10.179
- I'd like to ask you a few...
- Look,

13:10.214 --> 13:12.181
my father would never hurt Paul, okay?

13:12.216 --> 13:14.584
They just had a small
disagreement, that's it.

13:14.618 --> 13:16.586
I smoothed everything
over between them, okay?

13:16.620 --> 13:18.054
Everything was fine.

13:20.123 --> 13:21.457
Well, if your father is innocent,

13:21.491 --> 13:22.925
then why is everyone in your family

13:22.960 --> 13:24.460
stonewalling this investigation?

13:24.494 --> 13:28.231
- We're not.
- Yes, you are. What are you hiding?

13:30.467 --> 13:31.968
If your father's not
stopping you from talking,

13:32.002 --> 13:33.536
then someone else is.

13:33.570 --> 13:35.938
Who are you afraid of?

13:38.542 --> 13:40.376
Listen, I get it.

13:40.410 --> 13:42.845
You're consumed by guilt and anger.

13:42.879 --> 13:45.348
You're conflicted.
You're the peacekeeper.

13:45.382 --> 13:47.350
That's why you intervene,
to keep things calm

13:47.828 --> 13:49.529
between your dad and your cousin.

13:51.088 --> 13:53.990
I can help you, but I need a name.

14:04.735 --> 14:06.335
Shqiponja.

14:07.938 --> 14:11.040
Shqiponja? I need a full name.

14:13.543 --> 14:16.679
But I'm not afraid of him anymore.

14:16.713 --> 14:21.350
If you don't take care of him, I will.

14:21.376 --> 14:24.448
"Shqiponja" is Albanian for "eagle,"

14:24.550 --> 14:25.893
which leads me to
believe that our suspect

14:25.956 --> 14:27.590
is of Albanian descent.

14:27.624 --> 14:29.325
Sergeant, have you heard of him?

14:29.359 --> 14:32.261
Yes, his real name is Nazmi Dushku.

14:32.296 --> 14:35.164
He's a local crime boss
and a very dangerous man.

14:35.198 --> 14:37.600
Well, according to Leo Stavros,
he's been extorting the family,

14:37.634 --> 14:39.368
and they were late paying this month.

14:39.403 --> 14:40.236
So we're thinking Paul's murder

14:40.270 --> 14:41.337
was this guy's late fee.

14:41.371 --> 14:43.906
Yeah, and the family hasn't
alerted the police yet

14:43.940 --> 14:45.675
because they're worried about doing so

14:45.709 --> 14:47.243
would make things work with Dushku.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.945
And they're right. If he's involved,

14:49.980 --> 14:52.381
things just went from bad to worse.

14:52.416 --> 14:55.618
Dushku is also shop
steward for Patallis Chios,

14:55.652 --> 14:58.954
the most powerful
longshoreman union in Greece.

14:58.989 --> 15:00.982
Which means he basically runs the port.

15:01.021 --> 15:04.460
He controls the import
and export of everything,

15:04.494 --> 15:06.228
from textiles to food.

15:06.263 --> 15:08.297
Shop stewards are looked upon as gods,

15:08.332 --> 15:10.299
omnipotent, knowing all that goes on

15:10.334 --> 15:12.702
in and around the city,
so his job ultimately

15:12.736 --> 15:15.471
makes him one of the most
powerful men in Athens.

15:15.505 --> 15:18.872
So then wielding that kind of
power would feel untouchable.

15:18.981 --> 15:20.643
He wouldn't be worried about
getting caught dumping a body

15:20.677 --> 15:21.877
out for the world to see.

15:21.912 --> 15:23.479
There are rumors about Dushku

15:23.513 --> 15:25.214
being a prized fighter in Greece.

15:25.248 --> 15:27.950
He claims to have won
every fight by knockouts.

15:27.984 --> 15:29.085
Some were fatal.

15:29.119 --> 15:31.921
Maybe he's sending a warning
to Stavros and the others

15:31.955 --> 15:34.156
that he's not to be trifled with.

15:34.191 --> 15:36.459
Let's go talk to Mr. Dushku.

15:48.638 --> 15:51.307
Nazmi Dushku?

15:53.043 --> 15:54.477
Yes?

15:54.511 --> 15:55.578
I'm Sergeant Balaban.

15:55.612 --> 15:59.081
This is Agent Garrett and
Agent Seger of the FBI.

15:59.116 --> 16:02.685
We'd like to speak to you about
the murder of Paul Stavros.

16:02.719 --> 16:04.620
I'm in the middle of something.

16:04.654 --> 16:07.623
- Perhaps we can speak later.
- No, we'll speak now.

16:12.462 --> 16:14.530
I have reason to believe
you've been extorting money

16:14.564 --> 16:17.600
from the Stavros family.

16:17.634 --> 16:21.437
When they failed to meet
the payment deadline,

16:21.471 --> 16:23.806
you killed this young man as payback.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.474
Yeah, you beat him to death,

16:25.509 --> 16:28.444
just like all of your former
opponents in the boxing ring.

16:28.478 --> 16:30.312
It's just business.

16:30.347 --> 16:32.715
But business can be tricky.

16:32.749 --> 16:36.986
They don't pay on time,
they finagle prices.

16:37.020 --> 16:39.288
They break promises.

16:39.322 --> 16:42.057
Man of your stature and power
in Athens? You can't have that.

16:42.092 --> 16:44.293
Seems unlikely that a man like you

16:44.327 --> 16:47.530
would tolerate such disrespect
from the Stavros family.

16:47.564 --> 16:51.233
Greeks use their nationalism
as prejudice against my people.

16:51.268 --> 16:54.503
They want to repress
Albanians, keep us down.

16:54.538 --> 16:56.405
But you're not gonna
allow that, are you?

16:56.440 --> 16:57.406
Right.

16:57.441 --> 17:00.876
Every time I get knocked
down, I get back up.

17:05.048 --> 17:08.517
No one is going to stand in my way,

17:08.551 --> 17:10.886
not even the police.

17:12.355 --> 17:14.490
Let me see your hands.

17:24.134 --> 17:26.301
You've wasted enough of my time.

17:28.472 --> 17:31.106
Doesn't look like he's
been in a fight recently.

17:31.141 --> 17:33.542
Not a mark on him.

17:33.577 --> 17:36.779
No. But he certainly
enjoyed grandstanding for us.

17:36.813 --> 17:38.881
I think at this point in his career,

17:38.915 --> 17:41.217
Dushku feels he's above such dirty work.

17:41.251 --> 17:42.785
Yeah, it's possible he'd have

17:42.819 --> 17:44.553
someone he trusts do it for him.

17:44.588 --> 17:47.590
This isn't over for Dushku.
There'll be more bloodshed.

18:28.839 --> 18:30.198
Okay.

18:30.511 --> 18:32.167
Now I've known you long enough to know

18:32.237 --> 18:33.918
when something's bothering you.

18:34.026 --> 18:35.126
So what's going on?

18:36.039 --> 18:39.931
Haven't had an update on
Ryan since we left Mexico.

18:42.901 --> 18:44.669
And Karen's asking questions.

18:44.703 --> 18:46.570
She deserves to know something.

18:46.605 --> 18:48.973
I have no doubt that
she can handle the truth.

18:49.007 --> 18:51.084
Yeah, I know that.

18:52.611 --> 18:55.346
But how can I tell my wife
I was just doing my job

18:55.380 --> 18:57.148
when I put our son in a Mexican prison

18:57.182 --> 18:59.684
in order to maintain his cover?

19:02.387 --> 19:05.289
And I'm supposed to keep that to myself?

19:11.697 --> 19:12.897
Sergeant Balaban.

19:15.934 --> 19:18.736
We have another body.

19:25.143 --> 19:28.279
The victim has been
identified as Besnik Heta.

19:28.313 --> 19:31.449
He works as a foreman for
the Patallis Chios Union.

19:31.483 --> 19:34.051
And he's Dushku's right-hand man.

19:34.086 --> 19:36.687
Besnik looks similar to Paul Stavros.

19:36.722 --> 19:39.957
Killer dumped him in
another public location.

19:39.992 --> 19:41.959
- Any witnesses?
- No.

19:41.994 --> 19:44.528
And nothing captured
on the security cameras.

19:44.563 --> 19:46.030
Where was he last seen?

19:46.064 --> 19:48.065
Leaving a taverna near Syntagma.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.067
Patron said he sat at the bar alone

19:50.102 --> 19:52.269
and then left after a couple hours.

19:52.304 --> 19:54.238
Why would Dushku kill his own guy?

19:54.272 --> 19:55.940
Well, with the FBI asking questions,

19:55.974 --> 19:58.042
maybe he's trying to tie up loose ends.

19:58.076 --> 20:01.112
I don't think so. Dushku and Heta

20:01.146 --> 20:03.080
were best friends since childhood.

20:03.115 --> 20:03.948
Came to Greece together.

20:03.982 --> 20:06.884
Heta even did some time for Dushku.

20:06.918 --> 20:08.953
Refused to flip for a lesser charge.

20:08.987 --> 20:11.422
But Dushku is very powerful.
He's a dangerous guy.

20:11.456 --> 20:14.158
Killing his right-hand man...
That might be a message.

20:14.192 --> 20:16.994
Or maybe we're looking at
something else... payback.

20:17.029 --> 20:20.097
Stavros family versus Dushku?

20:20.132 --> 20:21.265
You know, when I spoke to Leo Stavros,

20:21.299 --> 20:23.834
earlier he threatened taking
things into his own hands

20:23.869 --> 20:26.937
- to avenge his cousin's murder.
- So maybe he followed through.

20:26.972 --> 20:28.806
You two head back to the restaurant,

20:28.840 --> 20:30.074
see if Leo has an alibi.

20:30.108 --> 20:32.443
I will send an officer
to pick up Dushku,

20:32.477 --> 20:34.745
bring him back to the station
for further questioning.

20:34.780 --> 20:38.682
Mae, we'll have the body
transported back to the jet

20:38.717 --> 20:41.819
so you can get started on the autopsy.

20:57.394 --> 21:00.704
Besnik Heta's COD was the
same as Paul Stavros...

21:00.739 --> 21:04.175
blunt force trauma. They
were both beaten to death.

21:04.209 --> 21:07.778
Besnik's hands were swollen and mangled.

21:07.813 --> 21:11.615
He also had this curious
tic-TAC-toe burn mark

21:11.650 --> 21:13.050
on his left palm.

21:13.085 --> 21:15.619
Did he get it prior to
the abduction or after?

21:15.654 --> 21:18.522
It's hard to say, but there was
a lot of post-mortem bruising

21:18.557 --> 21:20.658
all over the body, which suggests that

21:20.692 --> 21:22.226
the killer took a death blow

21:22.260 --> 21:24.295
and then continued
to inflict punishment.

21:24.329 --> 21:27.031
Classic overkill. He
didn't know when to stop.

21:27.065 --> 21:29.667
His rage superseded all impulse control.

21:29.701 --> 21:31.168
Yeah, it's like he's consumed

21:31.203 --> 21:33.204
with his anger towards the victim.

21:33.238 --> 21:35.139
Oh, you know what else is weird?

21:35.173 --> 21:37.041
Come look at this.

21:39.778 --> 21:42.880
These measurements of the
suspect's fists in both kills

21:42.914 --> 21:44.682
are exactly the same.

21:44.716 --> 21:47.251
It would be unlikely that
Dushku and the Stavroses

21:47.285 --> 21:49.320
have the same killer
working for them, right?

21:49.354 --> 21:53.157
Right. And I don't think
this is about revenge, anyway,

21:53.191 --> 21:55.693
not between these two families.

21:55.727 --> 21:58.229
You know, something
else has been bugging me.

21:58.263 --> 22:01.398
The murders themselves
are direct and brutal.

22:01.433 --> 22:02.766
And the fist impressions would suggest

22:02.801 --> 22:04.902
the killer was large, formidable,

22:04.936 --> 22:07.671
someone who could easily
overpower their victims.

22:07.706 --> 22:09.340
And yet both were abducted

22:09.374 --> 22:12.276
while in extremely
vulnerable situations.

22:12.310 --> 22:14.899
Bingo. I mean, Paul was grabbed

22:14.938 --> 22:16.113
pretty much with his pants down.

22:16.140 --> 22:17.907
And Besnik's blood alcohol, .25...

22:17.949 --> 22:20.584
That would have made
him too drunk to resist.

22:20.619 --> 22:22.659
So the methodology of the abductions

22:22.680 --> 22:24.144
and the pathology of the murders

22:24.191 --> 22:26.357
contradict each other,
which would suggest that

22:26.391 --> 22:28.392
we may be looking for two killers.

22:28.426 --> 22:30.861
Kind of a killing tag team.

22:30.896 --> 22:32.596
Let's call one UnSub "The Finder."

22:32.631 --> 22:34.431
He's the one who hunts and stalks.

22:34.466 --> 22:36.233
The other we'll call "The Fighter."

22:36.268 --> 22:38.636
He's the one who beats
the victims to death.

22:38.670 --> 22:40.604
Okay, so now we just to figure out

22:40.639 --> 22:42.239
what their shared motive is.

22:43.712 --> 22:46.877
What's also troubling is
their choice of victims.

22:46.912 --> 22:51.282
First, they killed Paul, then Besnik,

22:51.316 --> 22:54.151
making it appear that one
murder is revenge for the other.

22:54.186 --> 22:56.287
These UnSubs may have just

22:56.321 --> 22:58.923
inadvertently started a clan war.

23:03.261 --> 23:04.962
I do not even know a Besnik Heta.

23:04.996 --> 23:06.681
He works for Nazmi Dushku,

23:06.736 --> 23:08.265
whom you said you would take care of

23:08.300 --> 23:09.934
when you thought he killed Paul.

23:09.968 --> 23:12.503
Yeah, now one of Dushku's
men turns up dead.

23:12.537 --> 23:15.272
I have nothing to do with any murder.

23:15.307 --> 23:17.508
Okay? That was said out of anger...

23:17.542 --> 23:19.009
and grief.

23:19.044 --> 23:20.344
Where were you this morning?

23:20.378 --> 23:21.912
At the Plaka Central Fish Market.

23:21.947 --> 23:24.014
I was picking up calamari
and fresh sea bass.

23:24.049 --> 23:25.887
Anybody corroborate your alibi?

23:25.918 --> 23:28.252
Yes, our chef, Mikralis. We
were together all morning.

23:28.286 --> 23:30.621
Let me see your hands.

23:34.025 --> 23:35.826
Clean.

23:35.860 --> 23:37.494
I haven't laid a finger on anyone, okay?

23:37.529 --> 23:39.063
I wouldn't harm a fly.

23:40.332 --> 23:42.333
First you come here,
and you accuse my father

23:42.367 --> 23:44.864
of killing my cousin,
and now you suggest

23:44.926 --> 23:47.438
I murder one of Shqiponja's
cronies as a payback.

23:50.408 --> 23:52.977
You're wasting time pointing
the finger at our family

23:53.011 --> 23:55.212
when the real killer...
He's still out there.

23:57.849 --> 24:01.018
Hey! Hey!

24:01.052 --> 24:02.620
FBI! Stop!

24:14.366 --> 24:17.067
They're in the car!

24:17.102 --> 24:18.702
Get out of the car!

24:18.737 --> 24:20.371
Get out of the car and put
your hands on your head now!

24:20.405 --> 24:24.375
Hands on your head now! Get out!

24:32.917 --> 24:37.122
_

24:37.208 --> 24:39.013
_

24:39.130 --> 24:41.224
_

24:41.365 --> 24:43.130
_

24:43.295 --> 24:47.131
Hey, hey! Hey, enough!
Sit down! Shut up!

24:50.302 --> 24:53.570
Two men are dead. Someone's
targeting your people.

24:53.605 --> 24:56.040
They're setting you up to start

24:56.074 --> 24:59.389
this never-ending cycle of retaliation.

25:01.146 --> 25:04.448
Now any idea who would want you
to kill each other's families?

25:04.482 --> 25:07.818
- I have no clue.
- Could be anyone.

25:13.558 --> 25:17.165
Well, putting Dushku and Elias
in the same room didn't work.

25:17.243 --> 25:19.001
Those two are loggerheads.

25:19.048 --> 25:20.991
Yeah, well, sadly, ethnic tensions

25:21.038 --> 25:23.133
between Greeks and Albanians
are at an all-time high.

25:23.358 --> 25:25.905
Many Greeks blame the country's
current failing conditions

25:25.936 --> 25:26.585
on the non-Greeks.

25:26.647 --> 25:28.605
Yeah, so they're not
gonna agree on anything.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.307
Or be helpful finding the real killers.

25:30.342 --> 25:33.811
Monty, where are we with
pulling DNA from our victims?

25:33.845 --> 25:35.312
Well, I didn't find any DNA matches

25:35.347 --> 25:37.581
in CODIS or Interpol, but
like you always say, Jack,

25:37.615 --> 25:39.917
think outside the box, so
I thought outside the system

25:39.951 --> 25:41.585
and was able to gain access to RemBond,

25:41.619 --> 25:44.288
a contractor DNA database
established by the E.U.

25:44.322 --> 25:45.556
- You get a hit?
- I did.

25:45.590 --> 25:47.291
Collin Marks, a British businessman

25:47.325 --> 25:50.394
and also British Royal Marine
did three tours in Afghanistan.

25:50.428 --> 25:52.329
Exited the military nine months ago

25:52.364 --> 25:53.564
and is now based in Liverpool.

25:53.598 --> 25:55.999
Ex-military. Could be our "Fighter."

25:56.034 --> 25:57.134
What' he doing in Greece?

25:57.168 --> 26:00.437
Apparently, Collin was
scheduled to start work in Athens

26:00.472 --> 26:02.272
in two days, but because it was

26:02.307 --> 26:03.507
his first time in
Greece, he came in early

26:03.541 --> 26:06.443
to get a lay of the land. So
when did he arrive in Athens?

26:06.478 --> 26:09.279
Six weeks ago. He was last
seen checking into his hotel

26:09.314 --> 26:10.347
in the Thissio area.

26:10.382 --> 26:13.117
He was supposed to go
sightseeing in Omonia Square.

26:13.183 --> 26:14.877
Except for his military experience,

26:14.901 --> 26:16.088
there's not even a
hint of violence here,

26:16.151 --> 26:17.112
no criminal record.

26:17.151 --> 26:18.489
It certainly doesn't make sense

26:18.523 --> 26:21.525
for a killer with as much
rage as we've seen displayed.

26:21.559 --> 26:23.594
Three tours of duty can
be hell on the psyche,

26:23.628 --> 26:26.029
and being a soldier of
war forever changes a man.

26:26.064 --> 26:28.699
According to medical records,
Collin did suffer PTSD

26:28.733 --> 26:30.634
immediately after leaving the military.

26:30.668 --> 26:33.203
So something must have triggered Collin,

26:33.238 --> 26:35.672
and he snapped, sending
him on a killing spree.

26:42.745 --> 26:44.463
Something about this isn't adding up.

26:45.003 --> 26:47.938
Monty, any luck on your search
on the other missing persons

26:47.972 --> 26:50.207
in Athens who look
similar to the victims?

26:50.241 --> 26:51.952
Still searching. Should
have results soon.

26:51.999 --> 26:53.577
Collin Marks has never been to Greece,

26:53.647 --> 26:56.231
so how was he able to conduct
any pre-attack surveillance?

26:56.434 --> 26:58.969
I'd venture to say his
partner finds the victims.

26:59.003 --> 27:01.805
Question is, why did he become
one-half of a killing team?

27:01.840 --> 27:04.274
Okay, bear with me a second.

27:04.309 --> 27:05.609
All of the victims

27:05.643 --> 27:07.591
are around the similar
height, similar weight,

27:07.662 --> 27:10.623
but so is Collin. So what if he isn't

27:10.662 --> 27:12.276
a willing participant in all of this?

27:12.456 --> 27:14.651
What if he isn't a second UnSub?

27:14.686 --> 27:16.320
I know his DNA was found on the body,

27:16.354 --> 27:17.454
which means he is the killer,

27:17.489 --> 27:20.824
but isn't it weird that he
looks like a potential victim?

27:20.859 --> 27:22.960
And it's possible these
aren't just random beatings.

27:22.994 --> 27:24.995
The victims are being
forced to fight each other.

27:25.029 --> 27:28.132
Yeah. There's this ancient
form of Greek fighting

27:28.166 --> 27:29.500
to establish dominance.

27:29.534 --> 27:31.401
It was called "Pankration."

27:31.436 --> 27:33.403
It's... It's a bare-fisted combat

27:33.438 --> 27:35.188
where some men have fought to the death.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.485
Well, that means that we're dealing

27:36.571 --> 27:38.407
with just one dominant UnSub.

27:38.516 --> 27:41.120
So Collin's a victim here,
just like Paul and Besnik,

27:41.198 --> 27:43.503
only he survived to become
the ultimate fighter.

27:43.675 --> 27:45.742
His military training
would have given him an edge

27:45.777 --> 27:47.277
over the others.

27:47.312 --> 27:49.246
Exactly. It's most likely that the UnSub

27:49.280 --> 27:51.148
threw some guy in the cage with Collin.

27:51.182 --> 27:53.250
He saw how he reacted
to fighting for survival.

27:53.284 --> 27:55.218
The UnSub knew he'd found his champion.

27:55.253 --> 27:57.387
Okay, but if I was put
in a ring with someone,

27:57.422 --> 27:59.890
I don't know if I'd fight
them. What got 'em to do it?

27:59.924 --> 28:01.830
Well, you'd fight if you
thought your life depended on it.

28:01.916 --> 28:04.962
Yeah, it could be as simple as
putting a gun to their heads.

28:04.994 --> 28:06.496
I mean, that would jump-start
their survival instincts.

28:06.531 --> 28:09.433
Which means it's likely
there's a victim zero,

28:09.467 --> 28:12.235
and the UnSub may have killed
to show Collin firsthand

28:12.270 --> 28:15.973
there's fatal consequences
for refusing to fight.

28:16.007 --> 28:17.774
Then what was the
UnSub doing with Collin

28:17.809 --> 28:19.910
in the previous weeks
before the killing started?

28:19.944 --> 28:22.112
Breaking him down mentally
and building him up physically.

28:22.146 --> 28:23.046
Jack, I finally got a hit

28:23.081 --> 28:25.515
on the other missing persons in Athens.

28:25.550 --> 28:27.618
I found the man matching
the physical description

28:27.652 --> 28:28.785
of the previous two victims.

28:28.820 --> 28:30.354
Josef Gashi was in a car accident

28:30.388 --> 28:31.288
right outside of Athens,

28:31.322 --> 28:33.123
but when the cops got
there, he was gone.

28:33.157 --> 28:35.258
The UnSub may have just struck again.

28:35.293 --> 28:37.260
Sending the address now.

28:38.863 --> 28:42.366
Well, this is Josef Gashi's
car, and based on the damage,

28:42.400 --> 28:44.201
this wasn't accidental.

28:44.235 --> 28:46.103
So what do you think happened?

28:46.137 --> 28:49.053
Driver's door is still locked.

28:49.350 --> 28:52.342
Clearly, this window was
smashed with some kind of weapon.

28:52.377 --> 28:55.345
And directional blood
spatter on the passenger seat

28:55.380 --> 28:57.981
suggests the same weapon
was used to subdue Gashi.

28:58.016 --> 29:01.385
Yeah, blood and glass trail end here.

29:01.419 --> 29:04.354
And it appears our UnSub
pulled him out of the car.

29:04.389 --> 29:07.057
Gashi must have been
loaded into another vehicle

29:07.091 --> 29:08.725
and driven off.

29:08.760 --> 29:09.726
It's another blitz attack.

29:09.761 --> 29:12.378
But given the fact that
Josef was in the car

29:12.441 --> 29:13.628
with the door locked,

29:13.698 --> 29:15.620
he wasn't vulnerable at
the time of the attack.

29:15.769 --> 29:18.168
Yeah, this was a confrontation,
not a passive grab

29:18.202 --> 29:20.003
like the previous victim abductions.

29:20.038 --> 29:21.371
Our UnSub changed his M.O.

29:21.406 --> 29:24.508
He specifically targeted Josef Gashi.

29:26.444 --> 29:28.512
Monty, look into Josef Gashi's past.

29:28.546 --> 29:30.647
There might be something
in his background

29:30.682 --> 29:33.383
- that helps ID the UnSub.
- Copy that.

29:38.423 --> 29:40.691
_

29:42.443 --> 29:43.708
_

29:45.057 --> 29:46.908
_

29:47.177 --> 29:48.177
_

29:50.644 --> 29:51.644
_

29:52.792 --> 29:53.792
_

29:59.410 --> 30:01.820
Aah!

30:08.252 --> 30:11.588
A year ago, Josef Gashi
got into an altercation

30:11.622 --> 30:13.590
with a Greek man named Giannis Petrou.

30:13.624 --> 30:15.125
Well, how did the fight start?

30:15.159 --> 30:17.294
Josef Gashi, who's half
Greek and half Turkish,

30:17.328 --> 30:19.429
didn't take too kindly
to Giannis spewing views

30:19.464 --> 30:21.264
that Greece should build
an immigrant-proof fence

30:21.299 --> 30:22.232
along its borders.

30:22.266 --> 30:24.901
With the current crisis
here and in Europe,

30:24.936 --> 30:27.804
emotions are at a boiling
point regarding the issue.

30:27.839 --> 30:30.440
And let me guess. Giannis
took the first swing?

30:30.475 --> 30:32.275
And he went down like a bag of bricks

30:32.310 --> 30:35.312
when Josef Gashi responded by
almost beating him to death.

30:35.346 --> 30:38.048
He spent the next few months in
a physical therapy rehab center

30:38.082 --> 30:39.783
learning how to walk,
talk, and eat again.

30:39.817 --> 30:41.151
Relearning the basics of life

30:41.185 --> 30:42.919
would have shattered his sense of self.

30:42.954 --> 30:44.488
And bedridden, unable to move

30:44.522 --> 30:46.656
would have given Giannis plenty of time

30:46.691 --> 30:48.458
to obsess over his circumstances.

30:48.493 --> 30:51.128
And plot his revenge day in and day out.

30:51.162 --> 30:52.129
No, Giannis is motivated

30:52.163 --> 30:54.631
by his personal grievances
against outsiders.

30:54.665 --> 30:56.897
That's the connection
between the victims.

30:57.635 --> 31:01.071
The UnSub has abducted
an American, Paul Stavros,

31:01.105 --> 31:02.739
an Albanian, Besnik Heta,

31:02.774 --> 31:05.509
and a British citizen, Collin Marks.

31:05.543 --> 31:06.810
All are foreign nationals.

31:06.844 --> 31:09.279
All are symbolically
immigrants to Greece.

31:09.313 --> 31:11.991
They're surrogates for the
person who almost killed him.

31:12.046 --> 31:13.984
Yeah, he's an anger-retaliatory killer

31:14.018 --> 31:16.186
who is exercising his own
feelings of helplessness

31:16.220 --> 31:18.021
by watching these men
fight to the death.

31:18.055 --> 31:19.956
The others were just for practice.

31:19.991 --> 31:22.592
Now that he's turned Collin
into a killing machine,

31:22.627 --> 31:27.097
he can exact his revenge on
the true target of his rage...

31:27.139 --> 31:29.307
Josef Gashi.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.408
_

31:31.479 --> 31:33.424
_

31:37.188 --> 31:40.726
_

31:41.000 --> 31:43.390
_

31:43.594 --> 31:44.594
_

31:44.797 --> 31:47.673
_

31:49.181 --> 31:53.221
_

31:53.995 --> 31:56.651
_

31:57.499 --> 32:00.912
_

32:12.811 --> 32:16.131
_

32:22.553 --> 32:25.188
I found several potential
locations for Giannis Petrou,

32:25.223 --> 32:27.390
like a vacant house or
a relative's apartment,

32:27.425 --> 32:29.693
but the most promising,
considering all the dumpsites

32:29.727 --> 32:31.027
were within a quarter mile,

32:31.062 --> 32:33.063
is the shipping container
yard at the port.

32:33.097 --> 32:35.498
Giannis used to be a
part-time security guard there.

32:35.533 --> 32:38.201
There are literally thousands
of containers in the yard.

32:38.236 --> 32:40.214
And finding the right
one is not gonna be easy.

32:40.276 --> 32:41.938
We need to talk to Dushku again.

32:41.973 --> 32:44.074
His lawyer must have bailed
him out a few hours ago.

32:44.108 --> 32:46.376
I wonder if he knows that
one of his shipment containers

32:46.410 --> 32:47.944
is being used as a battle royale arena.

32:47.979 --> 32:50.247
No, that's too risky. Dushku's
a power-hungry sociopath,

32:50.281 --> 32:51.248
but he doesn't gain anything

32:51.282 --> 32:53.283
by having two innocent
men fight to the death.

32:53.317 --> 32:55.118
But he may be able to help narrow down

32:55.152 --> 32:56.953
the exact location within the yard.

32:56.988 --> 32:59.422
Mae, Clara, you head
to the other locations.

32:59.457 --> 33:01.591
The UnSub may be holding
the victims there.

33:01.626 --> 33:02.626
I will go with them.

33:02.660 --> 33:06.062
Simmons and I will head
to the container yard.

33:16.240 --> 33:19.242
_

33:22.179 --> 33:25.649
Do not lose.

33:34.319 --> 33:35.607
Open the gate.

33:37.225 --> 33:39.772
A man named Giannis Petrou is
using one of the containers here

33:39.842 --> 33:41.756
to hold and to murder his victims.

33:41.905 --> 33:44.354
Giannis has been doing
this right under your nose,

33:44.432 --> 33:46.776
making you look like a
fool, unable to control

33:46.810 --> 33:48.174
what happens in your yard.

33:48.284 --> 33:50.746
I think you know if that gets out,

33:50.781 --> 33:53.482
you'll lose all your power in Athens

33:53.517 --> 33:55.924
and get kicked out of
your job as shop steward.

33:56.057 --> 33:57.456
Giannis is most likely hiding

33:57.514 --> 33:59.248
in an isolated section of this yard.

34:25.014 --> 34:26.415
That's it!

34:30.020 --> 34:31.152
Yeah.

34:37.027 --> 34:39.333
Kill the bastard!

35:15.887 --> 35:19.414
Giannis Petrou! Lay down your weapon!

35:21.835 --> 35:24.707
I'm finally ridding my beloved home

35:24.741 --> 35:28.677
of these filthy immigrants.

35:44.027 --> 35:46.896
Collin Marks! Josef Gashi! Stop!

35:50.400 --> 35:52.568
Aah!

35:59.109 --> 36:00.776
Put the gun down!

36:00.810 --> 36:05.381
Foreigners are invading
from all corners.

36:05.415 --> 36:07.950
They are ruining Greece.

36:07.984 --> 36:09.785
I have to...

36:09.819 --> 36:12.227
eliminate them.

36:12.274 --> 36:15.524
Put down the gun! I'm
not gonna ask you again!

36:44.372 --> 36:45.639
I'm here to help you!

36:55.765 --> 36:57.433
Stop! Listen, stop!

36:57.467 --> 36:59.802
You don't have to do this!

37:14.622 --> 37:17.223
Stop! Stop! He's gone!

37:17.821 --> 37:19.254
You're safe.

37:19.289 --> 37:21.991
You're safe.

37:30.976 --> 37:33.410
I didn't wanna hurt them.

37:37.707 --> 37:40.142
Yes... you did what you
had to do to survive.

37:40.176 --> 37:43.512
It's not your fault.

38:16.343 --> 38:18.277
Great work back there, Simmons.

38:20.155 --> 38:23.291
So how's Collin doing?

38:24.020 --> 38:27.022
Well, he's got a long road ahead of him.

38:27.057 --> 38:30.918
I think with time, he's gonna be okay.

38:31.082 --> 38:33.441
Yeah, being forced to kill people

38:33.512 --> 38:36.280
with your bare hands or die...

38:36.314 --> 38:38.649
That's a horrific thing
to have to live through.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.952
Yeah.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.521
I wanna help Collin

38:43.555 --> 38:47.224
the way I've been blessed
to help other veterans,

38:47.259 --> 38:50.995
make sure he gets the support
he needs to get through this.

39:04.209 --> 39:06.043
Hi, honey.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.117
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:16.435 --> 39:20.510
The gardener got that gopher.
No more decimated rose bushes.

39:21.226 --> 39:22.768
Are you hungry? I can warm up some food.

39:22.804 --> 39:23.940
No.

39:25.197 --> 39:28.733
Jack?

39:29.666 --> 39:31.822
Let's talk about Ryan.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.117
He's in Mexico undercover.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.713
I was there...

39:43.305 --> 39:49.916
