00:33.760 --> 00:36.040
Ready or not, I'm on my way!

00:37.280 --> 00:38.199
Moon!

00:38.320 --> 00:40.519
-You don't say "I'm on my way."
-Huh?

00:40.640 --> 00:42.919
You say, "Here I come!"

00:43.080 --> 00:45.720
Nah, I wanna say, "I'm on my way!"

00:45.839 --> 00:48.320
But, but, but it's against
the hide-and-seek rules!

00:48.440 --> 00:49.800
Found you! I win.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.400
Let's play again!

00:51.559 --> 00:54.320
Are you gonna say "here I come" this time?

00:55.199 --> 00:56.400
Are you?

00:57.279 --> 00:58.839
Really?

00:59.000 --> 00:59.839
No.

00:59.959 --> 01:02.320
Then maybe we should play something else.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.360
How 'bout soccer?

01:03.680 --> 01:05.679
Soccer? Sure.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.880
Except I don't know how to play.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.560
Me neither! But that didn't stop me
from signing us up for a team!

01:11.679 --> 01:12.640
What?

01:12.759 --> 01:14.240
Did I forget to tell you?

01:14.440 --> 01:16.280
Yeah! Our first game's tomorrow

01:16.399 --> 01:18.679
against the best team in the league!

01:18.800 --> 01:19.759
Cool, huh?

01:19.880 --> 01:22.399
No... Not cool, Moon!

01:22.560 --> 01:24.800
We don't know how to kick a soccer ball!

01:24.920 --> 01:26.759
We don't even know the rules!

01:26.880 --> 01:28.640
You worry too much, Ollie.

01:28.759 --> 01:31.720
We'll just watch a game on TV
and figure it out!

01:35.520 --> 01:36.880
Whoa, Ollie!

01:37.000 --> 01:39.800
You ever actually <i>watch</i> soccer?

01:39.920 --> 01:41.119
It looks hard!

01:43.240 --> 01:45.399
How're we going to learn that, in a day?

01:45.520 --> 01:47.119
We'd need a miracle!

01:47.399 --> 01:49.160
Or him! That's Olavo.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.039
Brazil's soccer trainer!

01:51.160 --> 01:52.320
[gasps] Ollie,

01:52.440 --> 01:54.320
I'm having a brainstorm!

01:54.440 --> 01:57.160
Uh oh! When you have a brainstorm,

01:57.280 --> 01:59.440
I always get dragged off somewhere.

01:59.559 --> 02:03.520
We'll go to Brazil right now
and get Olavo to teach us!

02:03.679 --> 02:05.440
But Brazil's so far away...

02:05.559 --> 02:07.240
And our soccer game's so soon!

02:07.399 --> 02:09.120
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!

02:09.239 --> 02:10.680
OK, OK.

02:10.799 --> 02:11.760
We'll go.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.440
Just let me get my bag!

02:21.560 --> 02:23.079
Wheee!

02:32.720 --> 02:37.079
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>

02:38.920 --> 02:42.239
Wow, Ollie! Check out the rain forest.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.400
Right after you check this out!

02:44.519 --> 02:48.000
It's him! Olavo! What moves!

02:48.120 --> 02:49.160
What hair!

[whistles]

02:58.400 --> 02:59.720
Hey, my fans!

02:59.880 --> 03:02.679
You have come to admire
The Great Olavo's skills.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.079
-Nope.
-Hmm.

03:04.359 --> 03:07.560
Uh uh I mean, yes! Of course!

03:07.840 --> 03:10.280
But we're also hoping
you'll teach us how to play soccer.

03:10.519 --> 03:11.640
Please?

03:11.760 --> 03:12.840
We're signed up to play against

03:12.959 --> 03:14.679
the best team in the league tomorrow.

03:14.799 --> 03:17.280
And we don't know anything!

03:17.399 --> 03:20.239
Of course! I'll do anything for my fans.

03:20.359 --> 03:22.560
Just one thing you must do.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.359
Follow my rules exactly!

03:25.480 --> 03:26.640
I can do that!

03:26.799 --> 03:27.959
Can you, Moon?

03:28.120 --> 03:30.679
Pfff. Yeah, of course.

03:30.799 --> 03:32.040
Then it is decided!

03:32.160 --> 03:35.600
I will make you into the greatest
soccer players on earth!

03:35.720 --> 03:39.000
Now. This is the ball
the Great Olavo learned with.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.799
It is covered with grass stains
of my hard work.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.880
Now. You will learn it, too.

03:44.239 --> 03:47.640
First drill! I will wait for you
way over there...

03:48.359 --> 03:49.640
on the soccer field.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.840
And you, will kick the ball
straight ahead 'til you get there

03:53.000 --> 03:55.320
without touching the ball with your hands.

03:56.519 --> 03:57.920
We're on it!

03:58.280 --> 03:59.239
Uh, agh!

03:59.760 --> 04:01.160
-Ah!
-Wah!

04:06.000 --> 04:07.959
Aww. I don't get it!

04:08.119 --> 04:10.480
When I aim right, it goes left.

04:11.399 --> 04:13.959
And when I aim left, it goes right!

04:14.079 --> 04:16.039
At least you're making it go somewhere!

04:16.159 --> 04:17.200
[Moon] Uhh!

04:17.320 --> 04:19.200
-Whoa!
-Uh oh. Ollie!

04:19.360 --> 04:20.440
You OK? Ahh!

04:21.599 --> 04:22.680
[gasps]

04:23.920 --> 04:25.479
Stop!

04:25.640 --> 04:26.880
No hands!

04:27.000 --> 04:28.200
You heard Olavo.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.719
Really?

04:30.120 --> 04:31.039
[sighs]

04:32.360 --> 04:34.560
Erg, uh, agh!

04:42.360 --> 04:44.120
Hey Ollie, we're getting better!

04:45.479 --> 04:47.280
Moon, where are you going?

04:47.400 --> 04:48.520
Down the path.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.840
But Olavo said to go straight ahead.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.039
Yeah, but Ollie!

04:52.240 --> 04:55.240
If we go straight ahead,
we'll go right into the rain forest!

04:55.960 --> 04:58.400
He said "straight ahead".

04:58.520 --> 05:00.039
And you promised to follow the rules

05:00.159 --> 05:01.919
so we'd know how to play tomorrow!

05:02.039 --> 05:03.039
Yes...

05:09.360 --> 05:10.760
-Found it!
-Ha!

05:12.560 --> 05:13.479
Ugh!

05:13.599 --> 05:17.200
Hey! I dare you
to do that again, leaf! Ugh!

05:18.680 --> 05:19.719
Ahh!

05:24.560 --> 05:26.159
Ah! Hm! Aha!

05:29.680 --> 05:31.840
OK...

05:32.479 --> 05:34.719
Now we can use our hands, right?

05:34.840 --> 05:36.800
Uh uh, Moon. It's against the rules.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.400
So we do this!

05:40.039 --> 05:41.800
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Ahh!

05:43.000 --> 05:44.640
Ohhhh ah!

05:45.400 --> 05:47.400
See? No hands!

05:48.479 --> 05:49.520
Ooo ooo.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.680

Waah!

06:14.080 --> 06:15.039
Yeah!

06:16.440 --> 06:17.799
What a move, Ollie!

06:17.919 --> 06:21.000
You looked like
a pro soccer player just now!

06:21.120 --> 06:23.799
Looks like we might be ready
for our game tomorrow!

06:25.760 --> 06:26.799
Uh oh...

06:29.760 --> 06:31.799
Look who's back! What's he doing?

06:32.120 --> 06:33.840
-Ugh!
-Ah ah!

06:36.440 --> 06:38.359
He's acting like a soccer goalie!

06:38.479 --> 06:40.760
Trying to keep us
from getting the ball past!

06:45.680 --> 06:47.039

06:47.479 --> 06:48.599
[gasps] Ollie!

06:48.719 --> 06:50.919
I'm having a brainstorm!

06:51.039 --> 06:52.880
Yeah, yeah? What is it?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.680
Here's the plan. We walk past him,

06:55.799 --> 06:58.159
right after, we pick up the ball...

06:58.440 --> 06:59.479
with our hands!

[halting screech]

07:01.240 --> 07:02.280
Moon!

07:02.599 --> 07:04.240
But if we don't break the rules,

07:04.359 --> 07:06.960
we'll never get back in time for our game!

07:07.280 --> 07:09.640
A problem we wouldn't have
if you hadn't gone off willy-nilly

07:09.760 --> 07:11.080
and signed us up for soccer!

07:12.239 --> 07:15.680
Fine. We'll try something
I saw the players do on TV.

-Goal!

07:29.039 --> 07:31.320
We did it! Yeah!

07:31.919 --> 07:33.200
That's the good news.

07:33.479 --> 07:35.159
That's the bad news.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.840
[monkey whimpers and Ollie gasps]

07:39.960 --> 07:41.880
But that's Olavo's special ball!

07:42.000 --> 07:44.200
With all the hard work grass stains on it!

07:44.320 --> 07:47.159
On the bright side,
at least it's cleaner now.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.599
We've got to get it!

07:49.000 --> 07:51.239
Don't worry! I can reach it.

Ugghh...

Moon!

07:54.680 --> 07:56.039
No hands, remember?

07:57.919 --> 07:59.280
But then you two tell me

07:59.440 --> 08:01.919
how we're going to get the ball
out of the river, then.

08:02.039 --> 08:03.000
Hmm!
