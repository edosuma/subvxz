01:16.709 --> 01:18.336
<i>Brother.</i>

01:24.150 --> 01:25.777
<i>Mother.</i>

01:31.124 --> 01:33.820
<i>It was they who led me to your door.</i>

02:04.190 --> 02:07.318
<i>The nuns taught us
there are two ways through life-</i>

02:09.062 --> 02:11.758
<i>the way of nature...</i>

02:11.865 --> 02:14.026
<i>and the way of grace.</i>

02:15.135 --> 02:17.603
<i>You have to choose
which one you'll follow.</i>

02:30.416 --> 02:32.611
<i>Grace doesn't try to please itself.</i>

02:35.488 --> 02:39.788
<i>Accepts being slighted,
forgotten, disliked.</i>

02:43.997 --> 02:46.966
<i>Accepts insults and injuries.</i>

02:58.478 --> 02:59.945
Ooh!

03:05.518 --> 03:08.612
<i>Nature only wants to please itself.</i>

03:08.721 --> 03:12.851
- Bless, O Lord, this food to our use-
- <i>Get others to please it too.</i>

03:12.959 --> 03:14.586
...your loving and faithful service.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.423
<i>Likes to lord it over them.</i>

03:16.529 --> 03:18.429
<i>Bless these boys.</i>

03:18.531 --> 03:20.999
<i>To have its own way.</i>

03:25.471 --> 03:28.031
<i>It finds reasons to be unhappy...</i>

03:28.141 --> 03:31.406
<i>when all the world
is shining around it...</i>

03:32.478 --> 03:35.276
<i>when love is smiling
through all things.</i>

03:50.597 --> 03:54.328
<i>They taught us that no one
who loves the way of grace...</i>

03:54.434 --> 03:57.096
<i>ever comes to a bad end.</i>

04:04.677 --> 04:06.838
<i>I will be true to you.</i>

04:08.848 --> 04:10.179
<i>Whatever comes.</i>

05:00.366 --> 05:01.663
Oh, God!

06:31.557 --> 06:33.525
<i>My son.</i>

06:41.467 --> 06:44.834
I just want to die...

06:44.937 --> 06:46.905
<i>to be with him.</i>

07:27.113 --> 07:30.048
<i>He's in God's hands now.</i>

07:35.822 --> 07:38.689
He was in God's hands the whole time.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.326
<i>Wasn't he?</i>

07:47.467 --> 07:49.367
<i>My hope.</i>

07:54.140 --> 07:55.767
<i>My God.</i>

08:02.381 --> 08:04.474
<i>"I shall fear no evil-</i>

08:06.152 --> 08:08.552
<i>fear no evil,
for you are with me. "</i>

08:08.654 --> 08:10.588
<i>What did you gain?</i>

08:10.690 --> 08:12.954
<i>"Be not far from me,
for trouble is near."</i>

08:13.059 --> 08:15.254
Okay, go on now.
We're all right.

08:18.197 --> 08:20.290
We're all right.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.234
Thank you. Thank you.

08:36.182 --> 08:40.174
Sure, you have your memories of him, and, uh-

08:40.285 --> 08:42.379
you're gonna have to be strong now and-

08:45.658 --> 08:48.422
I know the pain will-

08:48.528 --> 08:50.393
It will pass in time, you know?

08:50.496 --> 08:53.158
It might seem... hard, my saying that...

08:53.266 --> 08:54.790
but it's true.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.869
I don't want it to.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.405
Life goes on.

09:03.409 --> 09:05.309
People pass along.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.445
Nothing stays the same.

09:12.652 --> 09:15.018
You've still got the other two.

09:21.193 --> 09:23.718
The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away...

09:23.829 --> 09:25.922
and...

09:26.032 --> 09:28.000
that's the way he is.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.437
He sends flies to wounds...

09:36.542 --> 09:38.669
that he should heal.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.856
<i>I never got a chance
to tell him how sorry I was.</i>

10:05.271 --> 10:07.171
One night he...

10:09.141 --> 10:12.838
punched him- himself in the face
for no reason.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.154
He was sitting next to me at the piano...

10:22.254 --> 10:24.882
and I criticized the way he turned the pages.

10:42.942 --> 10:45.274
I made him feel shame.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.573
My shame.

10:53.552 --> 10:56.316
That poor boy.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.322
That poor boy.

11:27.953 --> 11:30.080
<i>How did you come to me?</i>

11:37.029 --> 11:39.224
<i>In what shape?</i>

11:43.703 --> 11:45.432
<i>What disguise?</i>

13:09.288 --> 13:11.256
<i>I see the child that I was.</i>

13:20.900 --> 13:23.368
<i>I see my brother.</i>

13:26.272 --> 13:27.899
<i>True.</i>

13:30.342 --> 13:31.468
<i>Kind.</i>

13:38.918 --> 13:41.443
<i>He died when he was 19.</i>

14:14.086 --> 14:17.283
Just check this- this one against this.

14:17.389 --> 14:21.257
She wants to get back together,
but... that chapter's closed...

14:21.360 --> 14:23.260
story's been told.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.431
What are you gonna do?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.494
<i>Experiment.</i>

14:33.172 --> 14:35.766
When you're young,
it's all about your career.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.872
You don't understand anything.

14:46.752 --> 14:50.119
I just feel like I'm bumping into walls.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.531
I didn't know how to do her hair.

15:07.221 --> 15:11.451
<i>The world's gone to the dogs,
people are greedy and keep getting worse.</i>

15:16.061 --> 15:18.551
<i>I try to get into their hands.</i>

15:26.592 --> 15:30.358
Hey, Dad. I'm sorry I said
what I said. I-

15:37.069 --> 15:39.469
Yeah. Yeah, I think about him every day.

15:39.571 --> 15:43.132
<i>I just shouldn't have said what I did,
and I'm sorry.</i>

15:46.946 --> 15:49.779
<i>No, it's just, oh, this day.</i>

15:51.817 --> 15:53.512
<i>What are you thinkin'?</i>

15:53.619 --> 15:55.951
<i>I know- I know
you did everything you could.</i>

15:56.055 --> 15:59.149
And only two of those
were turned down by the client.

15:59.258 --> 16:00.885
One of them-

16:20.846 --> 16:22.973
<i>How did I lose you?</i>

16:30.189 --> 16:31.816
<i>Wandered?</i>

16:36.395 --> 16:38.056
<i>Forgot you?</i>

17:37.756 --> 17:39.656
<i>Find me.</i>

18:04.483 --> 18:06.451
<i>How did she bear it?</i>

18:16.261 --> 18:17.888
<i>Mother.</i>

18:55.534 --> 18:57.729
<i>Was I false to you?</i>

19:44.483 --> 19:46.110
<i>Lord.</i>

19:53.458 --> 19:55.085
<i>Why?</i>

20:02.768 --> 20:04.759
<i>Where were you?</i>

21:06.331 --> 21:08.458
<i>Did you know?</i>

21:24.416 --> 21:26.384
<i>Who are we to you?</i>

21:46.071 --> 21:48.039
<i>Answer me.</i>

25:58.990 --> 26:01.083
<i>We cry to you.</i>

26:07.632 --> 26:09.429
<i>My soul.</i>

26:18.143 --> 26:19.770
<i>My son.</i>

26:28.186 --> 26:29.813
<i>Hear us.</i>

34:34.338 --> 34:36.533
<i>Light of my life.</i>

34:39.811 --> 34:41.938
<i>I search for you.</i>

34:46.417 --> 34:48.043
<i>My hope.</i>

34:58.563 --> 35:00.497
<i>My child.</i>

36:20.178 --> 36:22.305
<i>You spoke to me through her.</i>

36:26.117 --> 36:28.642
<i>You spoke with me from the sky.</i>

36:30.655 --> 36:32.282
<i>The trees.</i>

36:37.228 --> 36:39.560
<i>Before I knew I loved you...</i>

36:41.999 --> 36:43.967
<i>believed in you.</i>

37:02.386 --> 37:05.082
<i>When did you first touch my heart?</i>

39:39.910 --> 39:42.140
And manfully to fight under his banner...

39:42.246 --> 39:44.714
against sin, the world and the devil.

40:25.623 --> 40:27.955
We had the commander over for dinner.

40:28.058 --> 40:30.526
This little devil bit him
right on the ankle.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.679
Mama!

41:02.426 --> 41:03.654
Me!

42:10.995 --> 42:12.986
Rhinoceros.

42:13.097 --> 42:14.792
Two alligator.

42:14.899 --> 42:16.696
Two alligators.

42:21.305 --> 42:24.832
- Kangaroo.
- Kangaroo.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.614
<i>Jump.</i>

43:03.881 --> 43:06.679
Mmm.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.368
Ah!

43:42.417 --> 43:44.046
Sweetheart.

43:45.489 --> 43:48.549
Shh! Please.

43:50.294 --> 43:52.728
I know. No!

43:52.830 --> 43:54.627
No!

44:19.023 --> 44:21.150
It's mine!

44:24.662 --> 44:26.323
You found me.

45:02.599 --> 45:05.693
You'll be grown before that tree is tall.

45:10.074 --> 45:12.167
<i>Blue. Far.</i>

45:14.978 --> 45:17.071
<i>You.</i>

45:29.259 --> 45:30.726
Are you afraid?

45:32.996 --> 45:34.623
Come here.

46:27.818 --> 46:30.844
Come here. All right.
Now, come back here, Son. Stay out of there.

46:30.954 --> 46:32.751
That's the Spencers' yard. Okay?

46:32.856 --> 46:37.122
You see this line? Let's not cross it.
Do you understand?

46:37.227 --> 46:39.957
Hmm? Do you understand?

46:40.063 --> 46:42.793
You see this line?
Lookit here. Look here.

46:44.668 --> 46:47.136
Okay. Now, come back here, Son.
Come on back.

46:54.344 --> 46:55.971
Stay out of there.

47:12.896 --> 47:16.388
"'Now, my dears,'
said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning...

47:16.500 --> 47:18.832
'you may go into the fields
or down the lane...

47:20.037 --> 47:22.471
<i>but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden:</i>

47:23.507 --> 47:25.600
<i>Father had an accident there.'"</i>

47:32.282 --> 47:34.944
That's where God lives.

48:01.778 --> 48:06.147
Good night.
We'll see ya in five years.

49:02.406 --> 49:04.897
You want to eat a grasshopper?

49:05.008 --> 49:07.476
I found a dinosaur bone!

49:07.577 --> 49:08.874
Oh!

49:08.979 --> 49:10.879
- Is that a rock?
- No.

49:16.420 --> 49:17.717
Ah.

49:20.490 --> 49:22.117
Hey!

49:36.106 --> 49:37.733
Boys!

49:38.775 --> 49:40.072
Come home!

49:44.715 --> 49:46.342
Boys!

49:54.191 --> 49:56.489
Come home!

50:08.939 --> 50:11.169
You're a "potleak" now!

50:11.274 --> 50:13.970
You're filthy!

50:19.116 --> 50:23.951
Bless this food to our use
and us to your loving and faithful service...

50:24.054 --> 50:27.581
and make us ever mindful
of those who are in need.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.318
Amen.

50:36.466 --> 50:39.401
Can you pass the butter, please?

50:39.503 --> 50:42.233
- "Can you pass the butter, please, sir?"
- Sir.

50:44.141 --> 50:45.870
What'd you do today?

50:46.910 --> 50:49.242
- Went to school.
- After that?

50:50.714 --> 50:54.514
What about the yard?
Did you put the runners in like I asked?

50:56.286 --> 50:57.753
Yeah.

50:57.854 --> 50:59.481
Yes, sir.

51:01.258 --> 51:03.556
Well, it didn't look like it.

51:19.342 --> 51:20.969
- Hmm?
- Yes.

51:34.224 --> 51:36.192
Mr. Reese liked Jack's book report-

51:36.293 --> 51:38.625
- What is that, sweetheart?
- and wanted him to make a model.

51:39.696 --> 51:41.721
You know this?

51:51.174 --> 51:53.267
Brahms.

52:05.255 --> 52:06.813
<i>Son?</i>

52:06.923 --> 52:08.220
Sir?

52:09.392 --> 52:11.690
Reach me my lighter.

52:19.202 --> 52:21.170
Haven't you forgotten somethin'?

52:46.196 --> 52:48.164
Do you love your father?

52:49.332 --> 52:50.959
Yes, sir.

52:53.036 --> 52:55.561
<i>"...against the Panther...</i>

52:55.672 --> 52:59.267
and they went off to look
for Kaa the Rock Python.

53:01.811 --> 53:06.646
They found him stretched out
on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun...

53:06.750 --> 53:09.241
admiring his beautiful new coat."

53:18.962 --> 53:20.930
Who do you love the most?

53:26.303 --> 53:28.737
I love you all three the same.

53:30.473 --> 53:33.442
Tell us a story from before we can remember.

53:37.314 --> 53:39.282
Went for a ride in a plane once.

53:43.053 --> 53:45.351
<i>It was a graduation present.</i>

54:00.870 --> 54:02.497
<i>Mother.</i>

54:11.214 --> 54:13.114
<i>Make me good.</i>

54:20.657 --> 54:22.284
<i>Brave.</i>

55:41.838 --> 55:45.001
Aah! Aah!

57:21.538 --> 57:23.870
<i>Can it happen to anyone?</i>

57:24.908 --> 57:26.535
Shh.

57:30.513 --> 57:32.640
<i>Nobody talks about it.</i>

57:37.053 --> 57:38.816
<i>Help me not to sass my dad.</i>

57:41.391 --> 57:44.485
Help me not to get dogs in fights.

57:58.741 --> 58:01.710
Help me be thankful
for everything I've got.

58:03.847 --> 58:05.974
<i>Where do you live?</i>

58:07.016 --> 58:08.813
Help me not to tell lies.

58:16.559 --> 58:18.857
<i>Are you watching me?</i>

58:28.838 --> 58:30.965
<i>I want to know what you are.</i>

58:37.647 --> 58:40.172
<i>I want to see what you see.</i>

59:32.935 --> 59:35.233
<i>Come here, you!</i>

59:35.338 --> 59:38.330
Come here. Come here, you!

59:40.376 --> 59:42.139
That funny?

59:48.317 --> 59:51.980
You're gonna stand there, and you're
gonna close this door quietly 50 times.

59:53.423 --> 59:55.914
Count it out.

59:56.025 --> 59:59.085
Three, four...

59:59.195 --> 01:00:01.993
<i>five, six...</i>

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:04.760
<i>seven, eight-</i>

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:08.359
You can't just yank off the top.
You gotta get it by the root.

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:18.147
- <i>Your mother's naive.</i>
- Whoa!

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:21.045
<i>It takes fierce will
to get ahead in this world.</i>

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:25.313
<i>If you're good,
people take advantage of you.</i>

01:00:31.727 --> 01:00:35.163
<i>Every one of these top executives-
you know how they got where they are?</i>

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:38.825
<i>Floated right down
the middle of the river.</i>

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:43.672
<i>Don't let anyone tell you
there's anything you can't do.</i>

01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:48.477
Don't do like I did.
Promise me that.

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:52.514
I dreamed of being a great musician.

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:56.985
I let myself get sidetracked.

01:00:57.086 --> 01:00:59.782
If you're lookin' for somethin' to happen,
that was it.

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:01.584
That was life. You lived it.

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:22.570
<i>Job imagined he might build
his nest on high...</i>

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:27.411
<i>that the integrity of his behavior
would protect him against misfortune.</i>

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.417
<i>And his friends thought, mistakenly...</i>

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.249
that the Lord could only have punished him...

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:35.950
because secretly he'd done something wrong.

01:01:36.058 --> 01:01:37.548
But no.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.187
Misfortune befalls the good as well.

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:43.458
We can't protect ourselves against it.

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:46.034
We can't protect our children.

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:48.968
We can't say to ourselves,
"Even if I'm not happy...

01:01:49.071 --> 01:01:51.801
I'm going to make sure they are."

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.808
We run before the wind.

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.640
We think that it will carry us forever.

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.270
It will not.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.212
We vanish as a cloud.

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:02.580
We wither as the autumn grass...

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:05.950
and, like a tree, are rooted up.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:11.321
Is there some fraud
in the scheme of the universe?

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:13.793
Is there nothing which is deathless...

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.797
nothing which does not pass away?

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.130
<i>We cannot stay where we are.</i>

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:23.501
<i>We must journey forth.</i>

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:28.043
<i>We must find that which is greater
than fortune or fate.</i>

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:32.241
<i>Nothing can bring us peace but that.</i>

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:36.512
<i>Is the body of the wise man
or the just...</i>

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.519
<i>exempt from any pain...</i>

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.714
<i>from any disquietude...</i>

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:43.553
<i>from the deformity
that might blight its beauty...</i>

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:46.787
<i>from the weakness
that might destroy its health?</i>

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:51.731
<i>Do you trust in God?</i>

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:55.565
<i>Job, too, was close to the Lord.</i>

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:58.333
<i>Are your friends and children your security?</i>

01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:02.105
<i>There is no hiding place
in all the world...</i>

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:04.475
<i>where trouble may not find you.</i>

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:07.344
<i>No one knows when sorrow
might visit his house...</i>

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:10.544
<i>any more than Job did.</i>

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:13.781
<i>The very moment everything
was taken away from Job...</i>

01:03:13.889 --> 01:03:17.017
<i>he knew it was the Lord
who'd taken it away.</i>

01:03:19.261 --> 01:03:22.253
<i>He turned from the passing shows of time.</i>

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:24.799
<i>He sought that which is eternal.</i>

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:30.569
<i>Does he alone see God's hand
who sees that he gives?</i>

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:32.698
<i>Or does not, also,
the one see God's hand-</i>

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:36.300
- I'm your man.
- <i>who sees that he takes away?</i>

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:38.880
<i>Or does he alone see God...</i>

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:41.142
<i>who sees God turn his face towards him?</i>

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:46.713
<i>Does not, also, he see God...</i>

01:03:46.822 --> 01:03:48.449
<i>who sees God turn his back?</i>

01:03:48.557 --> 01:03:51.390
That's a friend of mine.
He owns half the real estate in town.

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:55.223
Frank Johnson.

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:59.234
He started out as a barber.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:04.064
But he built something big.

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:07.233
Now you'd think he's the fourth person
of the holy Trinity.

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:11.903
They never talk about their money.

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:16.785
Wrong people go hungry...

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:20.013
die.

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:25.059
Wrong people get loved.

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.887
The world lives by trickery.

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:34.736
If you want to succeed,
you can't be too good.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:45.247
Hey there, young fellas.
How's it going today?

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:48.283
Do y'all want some barbecue?

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:52.648
How about a pound of brisket?

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:23.176
You're like this, right? Okay?
Come on. You act like you're scared.

01:05:23.285 --> 01:05:25.480
- You act like you're in trouble. You don't wanna fight.
- Nah.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:28.648
You don't want any trouble.
The minute you see him blink, crack him, okay?

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.022
- Okay.
- Okay? Come on. Three quarters.

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:34.153
Cover. You're gonna cover, right?
Okay. Hit it. Come on.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:37.494
Nice. Nice. Harder. Nice.
That's a good right. Let's see your left.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.194
That's the most important thing, okay?
You come in this way?

01:05:40.302 --> 01:05:43.135
You come in this way? You keep the guard up.
Hit me! Come on, hit me.

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:47.676
Come on! Come on, Jack!
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Come on. Come on.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:51.042
Here. Here it is. Here it is.
Hit it. Come on, Son! Come on! Son.

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:53.547
Left. What are you doing?

01:05:57.219 --> 01:06:00.052
Dust yourself off.

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:03.614
Left. Don't leave your tongue out.
You're gonna lose it.

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:05.751
Left. Left.

01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:07.590
Right. Right.

01:06:07.696 --> 01:06:11.154
Left. Harder. Harder. Harder!

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:13.428
Come on, hit me. Hit me.

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:16.198
Come on, Son. Hit it.
Give me something.

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:18.273
Show me what you got.

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:21.866
Come on. Go on.

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:29.243
One meal.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.400
Leave the table.

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:53.935
You too?

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:57.602
- You gonna continue to defy me?
- No, sir.

01:06:57.713 --> 01:07:00.739
You interrupted me.
I wasn't done yet.

01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:05.549
Am I finished?

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:08.216
May I?

01:07:09.391 --> 01:07:12.053
Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:10.711
<i>Makes up stories.</i>

01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:15.722
<i>Original words.</i>

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:26.859
<i>He says,
"Don't put your elbows on the table."</i>

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:28.765
Are you ready?

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.770
<i>He does.</i>

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:36.176
<i>Insults people.</i>

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:39.273
<i>Doesn't care.</i>

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:41.679
<i>I remember when you were born.</i>

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:48.790
They wouldn't let me come home.

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:53.995
The navy said an officer must be present
for the laying of the keel...

01:08:54.095 --> 01:08:58.055
but... not at the launching.

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:44.374
The next word is "volcano."

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:56.948
The next word is "socket."

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:06.832
Please pass your answers to each other.
We're gonna grade each other's papers now.

01:10:12.674 --> 01:10:14.574
No interruptions, please.

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:18.846
Come on. Get your pencil out.

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:26.287
After logs go to the paper mill-

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:43.090
Taylor! Taylor, sweetheart!

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:45.496
Honey! Honey!

01:11:52.407 --> 01:11:53.806
Let me go!

01:13:13.855 --> 01:13:15.652
<i>Was he bad?</i>

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:27.735
Will you die too?

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:33.063
<i>You're not that old yet, Mom.</i>

01:13:50.792 --> 01:13:52.589
<i>Where were you?</i>

01:14:04.806 --> 01:14:06.706
<i>You let a boy die.</i>

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:16.183
<i>You'll let anything happen.</i>

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:30.988
I can't see!

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:32.896
I can't see!

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:38.505
<i>Why should I be good...</i>

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:45.172
<i>if you aren't?</i>

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.756
Thank you.

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:53.039
Too close.

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:55.116
Edges.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.708
Why's this bare here, hmm?

01:15:57.819 --> 01:16:01.118
- Grass won't grow under the trees.
- Does at the Kimballs'.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:04.317
- They have a yardman.
- They have money.

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:06.394
Course, he inherited it.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:11.831
I don't want to hear one more word out of you,
not till this is finished.

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.203
Hmm?

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:30.842
Hmm?

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:54.368
Cropping that too close.

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:56.137
You're gonna have to keep that watered.

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:05.485
Not high enough.

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:25.637
Toscanini...

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.935
once recorded a piece 65 times.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:30.443
You know what he said when he finished?

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:32.570
"It could be better."

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:35.709
Think about it.

01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:40.754
Twenty-seven patents your father has.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:45.225
<i>It means ownership.
Ownership of ideas.</i>

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:49.092
<i>You gotta sew 'em up.
Get 'em by the nuts-</i>

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:51.722
- We'll get 'em next time.
- <i>pardon my French.</i>

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:53.528
<i>We'll be rich.</i>

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:59.139
<i>You make yourself what you are.</i>

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:05.542
<i>You have control of your own destiny.</i>

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.618
<i>You can't say, "I can't."</i>

01:18:11.786 --> 01:18:13.686
<i>You say, "I'm having trouble.</i>

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.685
I'm not done yet."

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.927
<i>You can't say, "I can't."</i>

01:18:54.829 --> 01:18:57.024
<i>Why does he hurt us?</i>

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:00.994
<i>Our father.</i>

01:19:06.975 --> 01:19:08.806
Come on, Dix. Come on!

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:10.241
Ah, yeah. Get it! Get it!

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:26.551
Give your father a kiss.

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.358
<i>He lies.</i>

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:13.370
- <i>Pretends.</i>
- Can you do something for me?

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.909
You promise you'll do it
without having to ask what it is?

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:18.639
Just have the confidence that
what your father asks of you is right?

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:20.510
Yes, sir.

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:25.314
For the next half hour, will you not speak
unless you have something important to say?

01:20:30.759 --> 01:20:33.227
What'd you do today,
my fine feathered friend?

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:39.465
Sit on the front two inches of your chair.
Better for your posture.

01:20:39.567 --> 01:20:41.535
I read that in the paper.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:48.040
Did you actually buy this
from Mr. Ledbetter?

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:50.771
Don't explain.
Just nod- yes or no.

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.674
- Hmm?
- No.

01:20:56.217 --> 01:20:57.514
Be quiet.

01:21:00.555 --> 01:21:02.523
What did you say?

01:21:05.326 --> 01:21:06.953
Please.

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:08.689
- Leave him alone!
- Come here!

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:10.958
Honey!

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:14.524
Leave him alone!

01:21:17.872 --> 01:21:20.238
Come here! Get back. Come here.

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:26.479
Get up there!

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.433
You turned my own kids against me.

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:28.075
You undermine everything I do.

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:38.944
- How do you like-
- Stop-

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.085
Stop it.

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:44.317
Stop it! Stop. Stop it.

01:22:48.429 --> 01:22:49.760
Stop it.

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:54.167
Stop it.

01:22:59.707 --> 01:23:01.834
Stop. Stop.

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:02.827
Where's Dad?

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.990
He's gone on a trip.

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:16.142
Whoo!

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:18.178
Whoo!

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:25.986
No!

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:37.528
Open the door!

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:50.143
- Get her!
- No!

01:25:50.244 --> 01:25:51.734
<i>Help each other.</i>

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:56.016
Do not slam that screen door!

01:25:57.819 --> 01:26:00.617
<i>Love everyone.</i>

01:26:02.623 --> 01:26:04.523
<i>Every leaf.</i>

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:08.719
<i>Every ray of light.</i>

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:18.169
<i>Forgive.</i>

01:26:45.666 --> 01:26:47.566
This is my house!

01:26:47.668 --> 01:26:49.397
You're allowed to live here!

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:51.631
You are allowed to live here!

01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:55.138
Get out of my way!

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:57.006
No!

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:58.908
Shut up!

01:27:13.327 --> 01:27:16.262
I got it, I got it, I got it!

01:27:53.734 --> 01:27:56.362
- Boom! Boom! Boom, boom!
- Boom, boom!

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:58.132
- Watch out!
- Watch out!

01:27:58.239 --> 01:28:00.605
Go!

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:09.443
One, two, three!

01:28:17.658 --> 01:28:19.319
I say let's bust 'em.

01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:33.831
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:28:43.417 --> 01:28:44.611
Yeah!

01:28:45.753 --> 01:28:47.015
We found a frog!

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.419
Let's go set it off with a skyrocket!

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:52.015
He's getting away!

01:28:53.961 --> 01:28:55.895
Get back! Get back!

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:04.935
Did it go to the moon?

01:29:07.775 --> 01:29:09.333
Where is he?

01:29:09.443 --> 01:29:11.070
Here he is.

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:15.072
It was an experiment!

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:20.584
<i>Liar.</i>

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:24.554
Never do it again.

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.093
Promise?

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:32.897
You gonna tell Dad?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.094
<i>They're just trying to scare you.</i>

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:40.535
Keep you ignorant.

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:46.406
<i>Things you got to learn.</i>

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:52.678
<i>How can we know stuff
until we look?</i>

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:14.504
They say you can't try stuff?
They do.

01:30:18.779 --> 01:30:20.337
What do you need to be afraid of?

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:25.710
You're afraid.

01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:28.615
I see it.

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:31.283
Right here! Right here!

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.111
I can't talk to you.

01:36:07.227 --> 01:36:09.559
Don't look at me.

01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:58.678
<i>What have I started?</i>

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:04.546
<i>What have I done?</i>

01:37:35.182 --> 01:37:36.877
Stick it in there.

01:38:16.356 --> 01:38:17.983
I trust you.

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.906
- <i>You tired?</i>
- <i>No!</i>

01:38:36.009 --> 01:38:38.375
I never get tired!

01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:40.879
- Did this morning.
- No, I was just pretending.

01:38:41.915 --> 01:38:44.042
- Gonna call me a liar?
- No.

01:38:44.151 --> 01:38:46.051
I don't want to fight.

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:48.212
Afraid to?

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:50.119
No, I just don't wanna.

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:54.655
If I was to say you're scared,
would you call me a liar?

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:55.854
No.

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:59.099
<i>Then you're scared, aren't you?</i>

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:10.173
Aha!

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:11.904
Quit it.

01:39:14.414 --> 01:39:15.745
Come here.

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.554
Come here!

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:05.688
No!

01:40:08.769 --> 01:40:11.169
I'm not gonna do everything
you tell me to.

01:40:12.472 --> 01:40:14.702
I'm gonna do what I want.

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:20.907
What do you know?
You let him run all over you.

01:41:11.665 --> 01:41:13.599
<i>How do I get back...</i>

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:20.698
<i>where they are?</i>

01:41:43.864 --> 01:41:45.832
- How are you, Son?
- Good.

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:58.443
This one's heavy.
You're gonna need two hands for that one.

01:42:05.786 --> 01:42:07.253
Whoa.

01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:10.449
Careful now. You know what that-

01:42:10.557 --> 01:42:12.218
- Chinese?
- Know what that- That's Chinese.

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:14.294
That's very good. Yes, it is.

01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:18.863
Your father went all around the world,
all the way to China.

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:20.831
That's Pan Am airlines.

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:22.799
That's what your father flew on.

01:42:22.903 --> 01:42:25.838
The entire bathrooms are stainless steel,
even the washbasin.

01:42:25.939 --> 01:42:29.238
I feel confident the deal's going through.

01:42:29.343 --> 01:42:32.176
If not, they can forget it.
I'll tell them all to go to hell.

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:34.372
- That's from Germany.
- How do you use them?

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:35.880
See that?

01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:40.917
Put that down, Son.

01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:43.353
Can Cayler come over?

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:45.857
Is your family not good enough for you?

01:42:52.032 --> 01:42:55.934
Hope it's not gonna take
as long as last time.

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:57.503
Al dente.

01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:03.206
Subjective point of view.
You know the difference?

01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:06.370
"Subjective" means it comes from your mind.
Can't be proven by other people.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.539
Mwah.

01:43:08.648 --> 01:43:10.115
So- Here you go.

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:11.912
Mm, mm, oop, oop, oop.

01:43:14.821 --> 01:43:16.982
- Good to see you again.
- Okay.

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:19.149
Let's go, boys.

01:43:19.259 --> 01:43:20.556
Come on.

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:23.863
There are things you can't do?

01:43:23.964 --> 01:43:25.898
Well, there are things
I can't do either.

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:29.628
You are not to call me "Dad."
You will call me "Father."

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:31.397
- But-
- But- Don't interrupt!

01:43:31.505 --> 01:43:33.405
- But you do.
- Don't interrupt!

01:43:39.446 --> 01:43:40.913
It's your house.

01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:43.209
You can kick me out
whenever you want to.

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:50.880
You'd like to kill me.

01:44:09.976 --> 01:44:11.773
- No-
- <i>Dad.</i>

01:44:16.283 --> 01:44:18.274
Why was he born?

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:46.305
<i>Please, God, kill him.</i>

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.668
<i>Let him die.</i>

01:45:57.317 --> 01:45:59.080
<i>Get him out of here.</i>

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.740
She only loves me!

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:38.346
<i>Defend, O Lord, this thy child
with thy heavenly grace...</i>

01:46:38.458 --> 01:46:41.450
that he may continue thine forever...

01:46:41.561 --> 01:46:45.429
and daily increase
in thy holy spirit more and more...

01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:49.491
until he come unto thy everlasting kingdom.

01:46:49.603 --> 01:46:50.900
<i>Amen.</i>

01:47:31.811 --> 01:47:33.438
I see something.

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:26.092
Put your finger over it.

01:48:28.301 --> 01:48:29.598
Like that.

01:48:31.838 --> 01:48:33.066
Come on.

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:33.193
<i>What I want to do, I can't do.</i>

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:40.770
<i>I do what I hate.</i>

01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:43.897
You can hit me if you want.

01:51:02.021 --> 01:51:03.352
I'm sorry.

01:51:06.893 --> 01:51:08.690
You're my brother.

01:51:52.839 --> 01:51:54.966
<i>What was it you showed me?</i>

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:06.984
<i>I didn't know how to name you then.</i>

01:52:11.491 --> 01:52:13.550
<i>But I see it was you.</i>

01:52:19.365 --> 01:52:21.458
<i>Always you were calling me.</i>

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:14.443
<i>I wanted to be loved
because I was great.</i>

01:54:16.949 --> 01:54:18.940
<i>A big man.</i>

01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:22.988
<i>I'm nothin'.</i>

01:54:26.893 --> 01:54:29.794
<i>Look... at the glory around us.</i>

01:54:32.999 --> 01:54:35.467
<i>Trees and birds.</i>

01:54:39.005 --> 01:54:40.529
<i>I lived in shame.</i>

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:47.437
<i>I dishonored it all
and didn't notice the glory.</i>

01:54:53.519 --> 01:54:55.316
<i>I'm a foolish man.</i>

01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:02.494
They're closing the plant.

01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:09.057
They gave me a choice.

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:13.234
No job...

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:19.341
or a transfer to a job nobody wants.

01:55:28.321 --> 01:55:29.982
<i>Father.</i>

01:55:32.358 --> 01:55:35.225
<i>I never missed a day of work.</i>

01:55:35.328 --> 01:55:37.296
<i>Mother.</i>

01:55:37.396 --> 01:55:39.956
<i>I tithed every Sunday.</i>

01:55:43.569 --> 01:55:46.561
<i>Always you wrestle inside me.</i>

01:55:51.577 --> 01:55:53.545
<i>Always you will.</i>

01:55:54.547 --> 01:55:59.780
You know, Jack,
all I ever wanted for you was...

01:55:59.886 --> 01:56:02.684
to make you strong and-

01:56:02.789 --> 01:56:04.848
and grow up and be your own boss.

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:10.421
Maybe I've been tough on you.

01:56:12.331 --> 01:56:14.356
I'm not proud of that.

01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:18.660
I'm as bad as you are.

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:23.868
I'm more like you than her.

01:56:32.485 --> 01:56:35.716
You boys are about all I've done in life.
Otherwise I've drawn zilch.

01:56:44.497 --> 01:56:46.931
You're all I have.
You're all I want to have.

01:56:54.941 --> 01:56:56.841
My sweet boy.

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:06.228
You just gonna stand there
like a bump on a log?

01:59:10.543 --> 01:59:12.010
Go on.

01:59:16.615 --> 01:59:18.082
Come on.

02:00:17.843 --> 02:00:20.471
<i>The only way to be happy
is to love.</i>

02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:26.681
<i>Unless you love...</i>

02:00:28.687 --> 02:00:30.655
<i>your life will flash by.</i>

02:00:41.867 --> 02:00:43.835
<i>Do good to them.</i>

02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:50.074
<i>Wonder.</i>

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:56.347
<i>Hope.</i>

02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:50.332
<i>Brother.</i>

02:02:40.519 --> 02:02:42.783
<i>Keep us...</i>

02:02:50.362 --> 02:02:52.057
<i>guide us...</i>

02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:03.870
<i>till the end of time.</i>

02:03:46.518 --> 02:03:48.418
<i>Follow me.</i>

02:10:53.278 --> 02:10:54.939
I give him to you.

02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:01.346
I give you my son.
