00:00.650 --> 00:03.570
Last night one of the workmen dug up
the section of a human hipbone.

00:03.700 --> 00:06.150
You think it's female?
I think, from the pelvis shape.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.140
I'll know more when I get her back.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.180
This is the body of a child.

00:10.210 --> 00:13.910
That's it. Join us next week
for the first of the semis.

00:14.100 --> 00:17.140
It's Eliot. His flatmate hasn't seen
him for a couple of days.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.310
Eliot?
Hi, Dad.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.970
To Dad and Carol.
Thank you.

00:23.130 --> 00:24.130
Thanks, guys.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.970
So the complaint against you,
Dr Finch,

00:26.020 --> 00:29.120
is that you verbally abused
and threatened Mrs Avery.

00:29.140 --> 00:33.560
No-one in this town believes a word
of these allegations. They know you.

00:33.870 --> 00:36.210
I can't make you a better salesman.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.160
So what do you think
you COULD afford?

00:38.180 --> 00:40.900
Just sign and date it, Mr Salthouse.

00:40.980 --> 00:43.070
I need some of my money. 4,000.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.800
Jamila, do you think that
you might ever consider marrying me?

00:47.090 --> 00:48.930
The bone was fixed
with a surgical plate.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.370
These are Greek letters.
They're a Cypriot firm.

00:51.570 --> 00:54.290
We make contact with each of
the families of these missing girls

00:54.490 --> 00:57.730
and ask them if their daughter
ever broke her arm on holiday.

00:57.890 --> 00:59.250
Your sister, did you say?

00:59.450 --> 01:01.850
And how sure are you
that she broke her wrist?

01:02.050 --> 01:04.290
100%.
She slipped by the swimming pool.

01:04.489 --> 01:06.970
'I think it was Cyprus.'
It's her.

Sorry, Dr Balcombe,
could you say that last bit again?

02:00.490 --> 02:03.290
The signal dropped out.
Yeah, yeah, I can. Go ahead.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.650
Have you managed
to get in touch with Winchester yet?

02:05.690 --> 02:07.850
I did, and the files
are coming up this evening.

02:07.890 --> 02:10.250
The original OIC died
a few years ago,

02:10.449 --> 02:12.610
so his number two's
going to give you a bell.

02:12.650 --> 02:14.810
What's his name?
'John Bentley.'

02:14.850 --> 02:16.850
He's retired now, was a DCI.
'Great.

02:17.010 --> 02:18.250
'Thanks for that, Jake.'

02:18.450 --> 02:20.330
Speak later.
Yeah, I'll pass that on to her now,

02:20.450 --> 02:22.970
Yeah, thanks. Bye.

02:23.130 --> 02:25.330
So, she was cleaning the skull,

02:25.530 --> 02:27.410
washing off all the mud and crap
and that,

02:27.610 --> 02:30.490
and, er, this morning she managed
to locate the hyoid bone?

02:30.690 --> 02:32.850
The...
The little one?

02:32.890 --> 02:34.730
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and after cleaning it,

02:34.930 --> 02:38.930
it actually came apart,
separated into two bits.

02:39.090 --> 02:40.090
OK.

02:40.170 --> 02:42.730
Can she say whether
that was pre or postmortem?

02:42.930 --> 02:46.690
Not 100%, no,
but given that hyoid fracture

02:46.890 --> 02:50.170
is pretty exclusively associated
with strangulation,

02:50.330 --> 02:51.370
her guess is pre.

03:01.850 --> 03:04.090
HE HUMS

03:17.770 --> 03:19.050
What?

03:21.650 --> 03:22.930
No.

03:24.050 --> 03:25.170
No...

03:25.330 --> 03:29.290
Frankie?

03:29.450 --> 03:30.810
You knew?

03:31.010 --> 03:33.490
I knew he was experimenting
with his identity, yeah.

03:33.690 --> 03:36.170
And you didn't at any point
think you might mention that to me?

03:36.250 --> 03:38.250
Eliot's capacity
for confounding our expectations

03:38.410 --> 03:39.810
is hardly breaking news, James.

03:40.010 --> 03:43.730
Besides, you don't get to piss off
to another continent for eight years

03:43.930 --> 03:46.730
and then just expect full disclosure
whenever it suits you.

03:46.930 --> 03:49.930
I'm still his father.
Biologically, I suppose, yes.

03:51.570 --> 03:55.610
It's been 17 whole years since
I left you for someone better, Mel.

03:55.810 --> 03:58.410
Don't you think
it's time you got over me?

03:58.570 --> 04:00.810
FOOTSTEPS RECEDE

04:07.130 --> 04:08.330
What did they take?

04:08.530 --> 04:12.250
Frank's missing, and they took some
money I had for a deposit on a flat.

04:12.410 --> 04:14.730
Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry.

04:14.890 --> 04:16.529
Is the van damaged?

04:16.730 --> 04:18.890
Yes, yes,
they smashed a window to get in.

04:18.930 --> 04:21.170
And have you got somewhere
you can get that fixed?

04:21.370 --> 04:24.530
'I don't know. No. I...
I'm just not thinking straight.'

04:24.730 --> 04:29.210
OK, first up, it's all gonna be OK.
We're gonna sort everything out.

04:29.410 --> 04:32.690
Look, I've got a thing in Manchester
I need to be at right now,

04:32.850 --> 04:34.050
but it's only on this morning,

04:34.170 --> 04:37.210
so I could pop down late afternoon,
how does that sound?

04:37.410 --> 04:39.250
I'd really appreciate
having somebody here.

04:39.410 --> 04:40.690
I don't feel at all good.

04:40.890 --> 04:43.170
'But you can't just drop...'
Then let's do that.

04:43.370 --> 04:47.930
I could be with you by about four.
You OK till then?

04:48.090 --> 04:49.610
Yeah.

04:49.770 --> 04:51.250
Yeah. Thanks, Tim.

04:51.410 --> 04:53.170
'It's all gonna be OK.'

04:53.370 --> 04:55.210
Lots of love, mate.
I'll see you at four.

04:55.410 --> 04:57.250
'OK, yeah,
I'll... I'll see you then.'

05:26.370 --> 05:27.850
It's a left after the church.

05:29.450 --> 05:31.930
Well, Mrs Avery
had been a patient of mine

05:32.090 --> 05:34.810
since I moved to the town in 2003.

05:34.970 --> 05:36.330
Just over six years ago,

05:36.530 --> 05:39.170
she began displaying
the early signs of dementia,

05:39.370 --> 05:42.810
specifically
a form called Pick's disease.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.650
Can you describe to me the specific
symptoms of Pick's, please,

05:46.810 --> 05:47.930
in its later stages?

05:48.130 --> 05:51.250
Well, in its later stages,
it's characterised by memory loss,

05:51.450 --> 05:55.650
by an increasing lack of empathy,
by repetitive behaviours,

05:55.690 --> 06:00.050
but perhaps most distinctly
by an increasing lack of inhibition,

06:00.210 --> 06:03.490
typified by regular use of profanity

06:03.650 --> 06:06.450
and bursts of anger and aggression.

06:06.650 --> 06:09.610
And was Mrs Avery's behaviour
typical of someone with Pick's?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.170
It was.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.930
So would you describe her behaviour
as challenging?

06:14.090 --> 06:15.370
HE SIGHS

06:15.530 --> 06:17.090
At times, yes.

06:17.290 --> 06:20.290
And in the six years
you were helping her with this,

06:20.490 --> 06:22.290
how many times
were you called to the house

06:22.450 --> 06:24.090
by Mrs Avery's daughter?

06:25.810 --> 06:28.610
I made 42 home visits
during those six years.

06:28.810 --> 06:33.010
And in that time, do you recall
ever losing your temper,

06:33.050 --> 06:35.530
or being verbally violent
towards her?

06:35.730 --> 06:40.170
No, there were certainly times
when I had to be very firm with her,

06:40.370 --> 06:44.370
and there were times when
I had to physically restrain her

06:44.530 --> 06:46.330
if she was trying to hit me

06:46.530 --> 06:49.090
but, no, I don't believe
I ever lost my temper.

06:54.650 --> 06:55.970
Twins?

06:57.890 --> 07:01.450
I'm sorry, we... we didn't pick
that up in our briefing..

07:01.610 --> 07:03.570
It's fine.

07:03.770 --> 07:06.450
Identical, or...?
Yes.

07:06.650 --> 07:12.250
I'm... exactly
what she would have looked like now.

07:13.410 --> 07:15.210
So can I start by saying

07:15.410 --> 07:18.010
we do obviously
still have to confirm

07:18.210 --> 07:20.970
that the remains we found
are your daughter's.

07:23.330 --> 07:25.050
Given what you've just told us,
Jessica,

07:25.250 --> 07:28.130
it would make sense if we could take
a DNA swab from you.

07:28.290 --> 07:30.170
Would you be OK with that?

07:30.330 --> 07:32.250
Course.

07:32.450 --> 07:35.850
And obviously
the sooner we can get that done,

07:36.050 --> 07:38.210
the sooner
we'll know for sure, so...

07:38.250 --> 07:39.570
Do it now if you want.

07:39.730 --> 07:41.370
OK.

07:41.530 --> 07:42.530
Yeah.

07:44.210 --> 07:47.290
And I should just say
waiting for the results

07:47.490 --> 07:52.050
won't slow down what'll happen now
from our point of view, which...

07:53.770 --> 07:56.050
..I assure you
will be a full reopening

07:56.250 --> 07:58.530
of the investigation
into Hayley's death.

07:58.690 --> 07:59.970
Where you found her...

08:01.250 --> 08:02.570
..and...

08:03.970 --> 08:05.810
..how her remains were...

08:07.570 --> 08:10.890
..will you be able to tell at all
how she died?

08:12.210 --> 08:15.490
From her remains alone
it's always going to be...

08:17.330 --> 08:22.770
..hard to be completely sure
so many years later.

08:25.570 --> 08:30.250
But there is some evidence to
suggest that Hayley was strangled.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.850
SHE WAILS

08:44.530 --> 08:46.850
I am...

08:47.010 --> 08:48.930
so sorry to have to tell you that.

08:51.410 --> 08:54.370
But please believe me when I say

08:54.570 --> 08:57.250
we are going to investigate this
crime as if it happened yesterday.

08:58.970 --> 09:02.490
We are gonna find out
who was responsible for her death...

09:04.770 --> 09:06.490
..and then we are going to make sure

09:06.690 --> 09:09.430
that they are punished
for the terrible wrong they did.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.400
Are you looking for Chris, Mila?
Yeah.

09:31.610 --> 09:32.770
He hasn't been in today.

09:32.970 --> 09:35.710
Oh, OK.
He said to meet him here at one.

09:35.730 --> 09:39.530
Yeah, we were expecting him,
but have you tried calling him?

09:40.010 --> 09:41.690
I'll try again. Thanks, Pat.

09:43.090 --> 09:45.250
RINGING TONE

09:46.610 --> 09:49.050
PHONE RINGS

10:10.780 --> 10:13.020
Well, let me tell you,
they loved meeting you.

10:13.050 --> 10:16.850
Oh, my God, did they?
Cos I was absolutely terrified.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.930
Sal, you knew who Stormy was.
SHE LAUGHS

10:19.590 --> 10:20.810
Stormzy!

10:21.100 --> 10:22.220
'Yeah, and him.'

10:22.290 --> 10:25.530
I promise you,
you are their life-long best friend.

10:27.250 --> 10:30.170
LAUGHTER THROUGH WALL
Yeah. Yeah, will do.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.490
KNOCK ON DOOR

10:36.970 --> 10:39.090
Oh, hi, Jessica.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.120
Have you got a minute?
Of course. Come in.

10:59.390 --> 11:02.710
I don't know if this will surprise
you or not, but, erm...

11:02.930 --> 11:05.810
no-one in Middenham's gonna
thank you for finding my sister.

11:07.130 --> 11:11.560
I mean, maybe they'll be pleased
for us on a personal level,

11:11.610 --> 11:14.930
that we can bury her, but, erm...

11:15.540 --> 11:18.930
it took the town
maybe ten years to get over her.

11:19.130 --> 11:24.250
The whole media thing completely
killed off the tourist trade.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.960
The holiday rentals,

11:27.050 --> 11:30.330
the passing trade that the teashops
and the giftshops relied on,

11:30.490 --> 11:31.700
that all completely went

11:31.730 --> 11:33.610
because nobody wanted to come here
any more.

11:34.970 --> 11:39.370
We were like a...
a Soham or a Praia da Luz.

11:40.590 --> 11:43.710
And now that that's all going to be
dragged up again, I just, er...

11:43.860 --> 11:45.220
I just wanted to warn you

11:45.330 --> 11:47.810
that you might not find people
that cooperative.

11:49.900 --> 11:53.320
As a copper, I get used
to never being that welcome.

11:59.930 --> 12:01.130
And you?

12:01.660 --> 12:03.530
And your mum and dad?

12:03.980 --> 12:05.580
Are YOU glad we're here?

12:11.540 --> 12:14.280
I wish you could have met my mum
and dad before.

12:15.410 --> 12:16.870
Ohh.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.290
My mum was amazing.

12:19.610 --> 12:20.680
Hm!

12:22.210 --> 12:25.370
Clever and funny.

12:25.530 --> 12:27.770
And strong. A really strong person.

12:29.330 --> 12:34.170
And my dad was kind and ambitious.

12:34.740 --> 12:35.820
Also funny,

12:35.850 --> 12:38.570
but more in a lovely
old-fashioned kind of way.

12:39.570 --> 12:41.480
What you see now

12:41.900 --> 12:45.350
is what 18 years of hell
does to someone.

12:47.490 --> 12:50.410
The grief, of course, the loss,
but, erm...

12:51.890 --> 12:54.410
..18 years of imagining

12:54.430 --> 12:57.040
what her last moments
might have been like.

12:59.650 --> 13:03.690
18 years of stupid hope
that maybe she might still be alive.

13:05.050 --> 13:08.290
Of newspaper headlines,
of people backing away from you,

13:08.490 --> 13:10.690
of strangers
hugging you in the street.

13:14.090 --> 13:17.770
For my dad, 18 years of suspicion
that it was him.

13:19.530 --> 13:23.410
For my mum,
18 years of unspoken accusations

13:23.610 --> 13:25.810
that if she had been
a better mother,

13:25.970 --> 13:27.530
then this wouldn't have happened.

13:29.890 --> 13:33.130
18 years
of seeing her everywhere I go.

13:38.410 --> 13:39.810
So, er, yes.

13:42.450 --> 13:44.010
We are glad, so glad,

13:44.210 --> 13:47.570
that we can bring her home
and lay her to rest,

13:47.770 --> 13:50.690
so that maybe we might have a chance
of rest ourselves.

13:53.610 --> 13:56.250
But don't expect us
to show that to you

13:56.410 --> 13:57.850
in ways that you might expect.

13:59.690 --> 14:03.490
We're different now to who we were,
and to everyone else.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.370
I completely understand.

14:09.450 --> 14:10.450
Er...

14:12.610 --> 14:14.530
These are her diaries.

14:14.730 --> 14:18.570
The original investigation
obviously has copies of them, but...

14:18.730 --> 14:21.330
but these were who Hayley was.

14:22.690 --> 14:24.330
Not the minx
in the News Of The World,

14:24.530 --> 14:26.890
not the charity volunteer
in the Guardian.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.330
She was just an ordinary girl

14:31.530 --> 14:34.890
who used to drink vodka
and swore a lot

14:35.090 --> 14:37.450
and sometimes
she was really irritating

14:37.650 --> 14:39.570
and sometimes
she was fucking brilliant.

14:41.330 --> 14:45.850
Just... a normal 16-year-old girl
like I was.

14:47.690 --> 14:49.650
And I loved her so much.

14:54.130 --> 14:55.570
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT SOFTLY

14:57.890 --> 14:59.210
Thank you, Jessica.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.130
Thanks.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.090
DOOR CLOSES

15:08.250 --> 15:09.570
SHE SIGHS

15:23.150 --> 15:26.390
Six will be perfect. Thanks so much.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.190
Bye now.

15:28.390 --> 15:31.950
So, they have the parts
and they can do it in 20 minutes.

15:32.150 --> 15:34.310
Do you know Lymmington Yard?
Yeah.

15:34.350 --> 15:38.190
Right, well, let's drive down there
together and get it fixed right now,

15:38.390 --> 15:41.350
and you have a photo of Frankie,
I can get some photocopies done,

15:41.550 --> 15:43.750
and you can stick them up
on all the trees and lampposts

15:43.910 --> 15:46.070
and whatever round here,
how's that sound?

15:47.750 --> 15:49.870
I'm so sorry, Tim.

15:49.910 --> 15:52.630
I'm so sorry
you had to come all this way.

15:52.830 --> 15:55.750
This is very simple stuff
and it's pathetic.

15:55.910 --> 15:57.230
It was just too much.

15:57.430 --> 15:59.750
Mate, it was just bad luck.
Would have floored anyone.

15:59.910 --> 16:01.150
Don't be so hard on yourself.

16:01.310 --> 16:03.070
You're doing incredibly well

16:03.270 --> 16:05.110
and we're all
just really proud of you, OK?

16:05.270 --> 16:06.390
Come on.

16:14.150 --> 16:15.830
EXCITED CHEERING

16:20.150 --> 16:21.830
CHILDREN CHEER

16:24.750 --> 16:28.230
Hey, hey! There he is!
HE LAUGHS

16:28.390 --> 16:31.830
Ohh! Hello, Peanut.

16:32.030 --> 16:34.750
You said you weren't coming.
I know, but I bunked off work.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.510
Don't tell anyone. Where's Mum?

16:36.710 --> 16:39.110
Oh, she's over there,
talking to Felix's dad.

16:47.510 --> 16:50.510
Mum, Mum, Dad's here.
He's over there.

16:50.670 --> 16:51.670
Oh, yeah.

16:53.830 --> 16:57.430
Hey! This is a nice surprise.
Is it? Good.

16:57.630 --> 17:00.350
WOMAN: Next race, please.
Oh, that's me.

17:02.670 --> 17:05.230
I stuck a cheque
in the joint account this morning.

17:05.430 --> 17:09.030
Couple of deals came through,
so... hope that helps.

17:09.190 --> 17:10.190
Thank you.

17:12.510 --> 17:14.670
Let's go and find a good spot.
Hm!

17:25.910 --> 17:26.990
I wrote that.

17:28.430 --> 17:29.550
I'm sorry?

17:29.710 --> 17:31.390
Top of the Glass.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.550
'92, I think it was.

17:33.710 --> 17:36.230
Not one of my better efforts.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.590
Huh.
KEYBOARD CLICKS

17:44.430 --> 17:49.270
OK, I got, er, 50 of these done.
Should be enough.

17:49.430 --> 17:51.750
I spoke to Rob at your gallery.

17:51.950 --> 17:55.230
He says you still have another 6,000
lodged with him.

17:55.390 --> 17:56.390
Yeah.

17:56.590 --> 17:58.790
But if you need any more
for this deposit,

17:58.990 --> 18:02.070
which I think is a brilliant idea,
by the way, just give me a shout.

18:02.270 --> 18:04.950
You can always pay me back
when you sell your next paintings.

18:06.270 --> 18:07.510
Thank you.

18:07.710 --> 18:11.230
But I do think you should consider
if it's time to...

18:11.430 --> 18:13.390
well, to think about
opening a bank account aga...

18:13.470 --> 18:16.350
No. No... No...
No bank accounts, never. No, sorry.

18:18.270 --> 18:19.590
OK, it's your call.

18:22.270 --> 18:24.430
Look, I need to shoot. Erm...

18:24.630 --> 18:28.510
And we need to have this drink,
the four of us.

18:28.710 --> 18:31.030
Well, I-I can ring Pete,
and maybe you ring Jamie.

18:31.190 --> 18:33.550
Deal. Look after yourself.

18:44.510 --> 18:47.030
We didn't actually get the call
till the following morning.

18:47.190 --> 18:48.510
Her parents had assumed

18:48.710 --> 18:50.870
that she'd gone
straight to the party after work.

18:50.910 --> 18:52.870
The first inkling they had
that anything was wrong

18:53.070 --> 18:55.030
was when she wasn't in her bedroom
in the morning.

18:55.070 --> 18:57.190
And after you'd spoken to them...

18:59.590 --> 19:01.710
..what was your first instinct?

19:01.750 --> 19:03.190
Mine or my guvnor's?

19:04.670 --> 19:05.870
Both?

19:06.070 --> 19:08.510
Well, for various reasons,
DCI Pearson believed

19:08.710 --> 19:10.630
she might have travelled
up to London that night,

19:10.790 --> 19:11.910
possibly with her boyfriend.

19:12.070 --> 19:14.630
And given where she was found,
he might have been right, but...

19:14.790 --> 19:16.910
I never really bought that idea.

19:17.070 --> 19:18.430
Because?

19:19.670 --> 19:22.230
There's nothing we learned
from speaking to her parents,

19:22.430 --> 19:26.230
her sister or any of her friends
suggested she was the sort of person

19:26.430 --> 19:29.630
who would have just upped sticks
like that without telling anyone.

19:29.790 --> 19:31.630
And where was her sister that night?

19:31.830 --> 19:34.390
She was at another party
ten miles away. She slept over.

19:34.590 --> 19:39.150
And in the end, DCI Pearson
came round to thinking same as you?

19:39.310 --> 19:40.430
In the end, yeah.

19:41.630 --> 19:45.230
But we lost five days
to her being treated as a runaway,

19:45.430 --> 19:47.630
time when we could have had
search teams out,

19:47.830 --> 19:50.030
thermal imaging cameras,
press appeals.

19:51.830 --> 19:53.550
Yeah, we lost a lot of momentum.

20:03.190 --> 20:04.790
I don't know what to say.

20:04.950 --> 20:06.910
What SHOULD I say? I just...

20:08.510 --> 20:10.670
Maybe you don't have to say
anything.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.750
Maybe you don't always have to talk.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.510
I just...

20:19.710 --> 20:23.910
I really do wanna try to understand.
I mean, is this...?

20:23.950 --> 20:27.390
Do you just wanna dress like this,
or...? Or...

20:29.030 --> 20:30.910
..do I want to cut my cock off?

20:33.150 --> 20:39.830
I don't know.

20:43.670 --> 20:45.390
I just know
that one day I wanna wake up

20:45.550 --> 20:46.710
and maybe not feel different.

20:46.870 --> 20:50.390
Why don't I take the rest of the day
off and...? No, no, no.

20:50.590 --> 20:53.470
Please, it might help just to...
Dad, this isn't about the past.

20:56.270 --> 20:58.790
Or at least not the past
you're talking about.

21:02.110 --> 21:04.310
I'm just a fuck-up.
No.

21:07.110 --> 21:08.270
And I always was.

21:11.150 --> 21:12.870
Eliot, don't go.
I'll see you later.

21:14.790 --> 21:17.190
I love you.
I love you, too.

21:20.430 --> 21:23.950
So... how did the boyfriend
fit into all of this?

21:25.270 --> 21:27.110
Well, Hayley
had started going out with him

21:27.310 --> 21:30.270
in the September
just before her 16th,

21:30.470 --> 21:31.990
and Dave Pearson
got it into his head

21:32.190 --> 21:34.390
that because Mullery was 23,
that their...

21:34.590 --> 21:36.950
well, there was something abusive
about their relationship.

21:38.470 --> 21:40.910
But you didn't feel that?
No, not really.

21:41.110 --> 21:44.150
He looked a lot younger
than he was, he acted younger,

21:44.350 --> 21:46.150
and Hayley
was quite mature for her age,

21:46.350 --> 21:48.750
so I just thought
they kind of met in the middle.

21:48.950 --> 21:51.110
We also never found
a shred of evidence

21:51.150 --> 21:54.150
to suggest that
she'd been in his car that night.

21:54.310 --> 21:57.310
So when he was discounted,

21:57.510 --> 21:59.670
what were your main lines
of enquiry?

21:59.710 --> 22:02.350
Again, DCI Pearson's theories,

22:02.550 --> 22:05.790
that maybe she hadn't travelled up
to London that night with Mullery,

22:05.990 --> 22:07.830
but that she'd hitched up there,
to follow him,

22:08.030 --> 22:09.830
and that whoever picked her up
had killed her.

22:09.950 --> 22:12.790
Or that she'd got to London safely
but had been unable to find him

22:12.990 --> 22:16.750
and some random stranger
had killed her there.

22:16.950 --> 22:20.390
Did you ever find any evidence
that she HAD travelled to London?

22:20.550 --> 22:21.950
No.

22:22.110 --> 22:23.830
So then we started exploring

22:24.030 --> 22:26.630
whether she might actually have
gone home straight after her shift

22:26.830 --> 22:30.350
and that her father had murdered her
after some sort of domestic row.

22:30.510 --> 22:33.390
And her mum wasn't home that night?

22:33.590 --> 22:37.030
No, she was working at a local pub
between nine and one,

22:37.230 --> 22:39.750
so the timing
could have worked, but...

22:39.950 --> 22:43.230
we never found any evidence
of any altercation at the house,

22:43.430 --> 22:46.510
there was no apparent history
of any fighting,

22:46.710 --> 22:48.670
and there was no evidence
of anything darker,

22:48.830 --> 22:51.190
like abuse or anything like that.

22:51.350 --> 22:52.510
What about other locals?

22:52.710 --> 22:54.270
Yeah,
we looked at the other boyfriends,

22:54.430 --> 22:56.550
but they all had good alibis,

22:56.590 --> 23:00.830
so then we looked at all local men
within a 30-mile radius

23:01.030 --> 23:02.670
who were on
the Sexual Offenders Register,

23:02.830 --> 23:04.390
but they all had
watertight alibis, too.

23:04.510 --> 23:05.830
It was the Millennium,

23:06.030 --> 23:09.310
so a lot of people spent those hours
in very public places.

23:09.470 --> 23:11.350
It was another complete blank.

23:13.250 --> 23:14.690
HE SIGHS
What can I say?

23:16.350 --> 23:18.470
We let Hayley and her family down...

23:19.800 --> 23:22.600
..and I remain... deeply ashamed

23:22.670 --> 23:24.840
of the way
the case was handled initially.

23:35.090 --> 23:37.890
Right, I'm gonna head on up, Guv.
Mm.

23:38.090 --> 23:41.250
I might have a wander, get a feel
for the place. Not tired.

23:41.410 --> 23:43.130
No worries. See you in the morning.

23:43.330 --> 23:45.170
Yeah, night, Sunny.
Night.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.370
So there's absolutely no evidence

24:32.570 --> 24:34.530
suggesting she did travel
up to London that night.

24:34.610 --> 24:35.700
No.
Similarly,

24:35.790 --> 24:40.700
there's an odd lack of any leads
connecting her to someone here.

24:40.850 --> 24:41.890
Yeah.
So...

24:43.770 --> 24:47.130
..what if she was brought
up to London already dead?

24:48.410 --> 24:51.530
Killed down here and then
disposed of in London? Yeah.

24:51.730 --> 24:57.450
Why would someone do that, drive
80, 90 miles to dispose of a body?

24:57.650 --> 25:01.210
Because you bury people
somewhere you know,

25:01.410 --> 25:03.690
an... an environment
you feel comfortable in.

25:03.890 --> 25:06.770
You think the killer's from London?
Near the burial site, probably.

25:06.970 --> 25:09.210
And drove down here
specifically to kill?

25:09.410 --> 25:11.890
No. I think
they might have already been here.

25:13.410 --> 25:14.530
In a holiday rental.

25:15.730 --> 25:18.290
OK, after Easter and summer,

25:18.490 --> 25:21.530
Christmas and New Year will be
the busiest time for holiday lets.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.890
My brother does it every year
with his family,

25:23.930 --> 25:25.690
heads down day after Boxing Day,

25:25.850 --> 25:28.050
stays, dunno, four or five days,

25:28.210 --> 25:31.090
heads back... 2nd, 3rd, 4th.

25:31.250 --> 25:33.370
Right. Right, right.

25:33.410 --> 25:34.610
Don't you think...

25:36.210 --> 25:39.810
..packing a dead body with
the wellies and the dirty washing

25:40.010 --> 25:42.370
would be a bit tricky?
Mm.

25:42.530 --> 25:44.010
If they were with family, yeah,

25:44.210 --> 25:47.210
yeah, maybe that part needs
finessing, but the...

25:48.890 --> 25:50.890
..the basic idea?
Yeah, it's a theory.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.050
Mm.

25:54.530 --> 25:56.730
Anyway, maybe sleep on it.

25:56.930 --> 26:01.370
Nice PJs, by the way.
Very... snazzy.

26:01.530 --> 26:02.690
Night.

26:02.850 --> 26:04.050

they're just parking up.

SHE SIGHS

26:12.490 --> 26:14.210

with a friend of the dad.

And that lot arrived
about an hour ago.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.810
Does anyone care that we haven't
actually confirmed it's her yet?

26:25.930 --> 26:28.090
It's not really about Hayley
for them, though, is it?

26:30.970 --> 26:33.250

28:10.650 --> 28:13.610
Did I?
Yeah, not a problem.

28:13.810 --> 28:16.210
Can we just pick it up from
the same place, please? Whatever.

28:16.330 --> 28:19.490
OK. And three, two, one...

28:19.690 --> 28:22.090
I'm afraid that's all
we've got time for this week,

28:22.290 --> 28:24.490
but joins us again next...
Oh, bollocks, I said "joins".

28:24.650 --> 28:27.650
No worries, yep. Er, just from
the same place again, then, please.

28:27.850 --> 28:30.290
You know what? I need a break.
Are you OK, James?

28:30.490 --> 28:32.970
I'm fine. Just give me ten minutes.
I'm not feeling 100%.

28:33.130 --> 28:34.610
MURMURING

28:36.570 --> 28:38.850
Shit, shit, shit.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.210
TAPPING

28:47.050 --> 28:48.730
RINGING TONE

28:50.730 --> 28:52.970
'Please leave a message
after the tone.'

28:53.170 --> 28:55.490
BEEP
Els, it's me. I just...

28:57.130 --> 28:59.410
C... Can you call me, please?

29:00.530 --> 29:02.730
I want to know that you're OK.

29:02.890 --> 29:04.170
Love you.

29:08.650 --> 29:11.490
Cos Mum had said he was always
nice as pie when I was there.

29:11.690 --> 29:15.890
I... I pretended to go out,
I said I was going shopping,

29:15.930 --> 29:18.450
and closed the front door,
but, erm...

29:18.650 --> 29:21.010
actually,
I just went into the kitchen,

29:21.170 --> 29:23.290
which was next to her room.

29:23.450 --> 29:26.490
OK, and what did you hear there?

29:26.690 --> 29:30.170
Well, I heard my mum
being a pain in the bum,

29:30.330 --> 29:32.450
which she could be, fair play.

29:33.810 --> 29:38.410
And then I-I...
I just heard him go for her.

29:39.810 --> 29:42.130
And how do you mean "go for her",
Mrs Pinion?

29:42.330 --> 29:44.530
Well, not... not like he...
he lost it or anything.

29:44.730 --> 29:46.890
He never raised his voice,
he just...

29:47.890 --> 29:53.930
He had this really... calm,
quiet way of talking,

29:54.130 --> 29:58.850
and he just kept telling her
what a horrible old bitch she was...

30:00.010 --> 30:02.250
..what a... what a burden.

30:02.450 --> 30:06.690
And... at one point
I definitely heard him say

30:06.890 --> 30:10.650
that he was going to give her
an overdose to be rid of her...

30:12.450 --> 30:14.250
..cos she was so much trouble...

30:16.810 --> 30:18.610
MRS PINION SNIFFS

30:25.530 --> 30:28.610
So, we've spoken to every lettings
agency within a five-mile radius.

30:28.810 --> 30:31.570
There are approximately
380 properties in this area

30:31.730 --> 30:33.570
available for rental at New Year.

30:33.730 --> 30:35.010
Right.

30:35.170 --> 30:36.930
Average adult occupancy is four,

30:37.130 --> 30:40.050
so...
knock off half cos they're women,

30:40.250 --> 30:44.130
you've got about 750
possible male suspects.

30:46.530 --> 30:47.690
Boss.

30:47.850 --> 30:49.570
DNA's confirmed that it's Hayley.

30:53.690 --> 30:54.690
OK.

30:54.850 --> 30:59.570
And, er, Andrews wants you
to make a holding statement.

30:59.730 --> 31:01.250
Here?

31:01.450 --> 31:03.610
Yeah, the press office
are gonna send you something.

31:03.650 --> 31:05.210
SHE SIGHS
Right.

31:07.690 --> 31:11.410
OK, erm, can you contact
Jessica and the parents,

31:11.570 --> 31:13.370
let them know about the ID?

31:13.570 --> 31:17.090
Fran, you speak to the press.
Tell them 15 minutes.

31:17.290 --> 31:19.850
And do you want us to start pulling
together lettings information

31:19.970 --> 31:21.050
for the Millennium?

31:21.210 --> 31:22.930
No, hold fire for now.

31:24.130 --> 31:25.890
Can you find me a printer I can use?

31:26.050 --> 31:27.890
OK, Guv.

31:28.090 --> 31:30.850
I won't keep you long, Mrs Pinion,
just three quick questions.

31:31.050 --> 31:32.610
How many other allegations
have you made

31:32.770 --> 31:35.170
against GPs in Dr Finch's practice?

31:35.370 --> 31:37.210
Two, but...
Thank you.

31:37.410 --> 31:39.970
And how many other practices
have you been banned from

31:40.170 --> 31:42.610
in the Hamhurst region
for making repeated complaints?

31:42.810 --> 31:45.330
I left them.
How many?

31:46.810 --> 31:48.050
A couple.

31:48.250 --> 31:51.330
I think the record will show
it's actually four.

31:51.530 --> 31:53.690
And last question -
in how many instances

31:53.730 --> 31:56.330
have you attempted
to achieve a financial settlement

31:56.490 --> 31:58.210
before a tribunal hearing?

31:59.850 --> 32:01.010
Perhaps I can help here.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.650
It's all of them, isn't it?

32:04.210 --> 32:05.970
Thank you.

32:11.170 --> 32:13.170
Pete's not in the office
at the moment, I'm afraid,

32:13.370 --> 32:15.530
Ms Salthouse, but I'm his PA,
perhaps I can help you.

32:15.570 --> 32:17.370
'Well, I certainly hope so.'

32:17.570 --> 32:21.130
Your salesman Mr Carr sold my father
a cash ISA the other day,

32:21.290 --> 32:23.850
and we want to cancel it, please.

32:24.050 --> 32:26.210
It's still within
the 14-day timeframe.

32:26.250 --> 32:27.370
'OK, can I just ask why?'

32:27.570 --> 32:30.410
He doesn't need a cash ISA,
and Carr should have known that.

32:30.610 --> 32:34.250
Right, OK, if you could just hang on
a sec and I'll dig out the...

32:34.410 --> 32:35.770
Erm...

32:35.970 --> 32:38.490
When was it your father saw him,
Ms Salthouse?

32:38.650 --> 32:39.930
I can't see any paperwork here.

32:40.130 --> 32:42.330
'Monday, and it's definitely
all gone through.

32:42.530 --> 32:44.130
'The cheque was cashed
this morning.'

32:44.290 --> 32:45.930
Right, OK, well, no worries...

32:49.010 --> 32:51.570
Good afternoon.
I'd like to make a brief statement.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.650
I'll not be answering questions
today,

32:53.850 --> 32:56.810
but we will be holding a more
detailed press conference in London

32:56.970 --> 32:58.010
in due course.

32:59.810 --> 33:01.930
I can now confirm

33:01.970 --> 33:07.090
that the remains of the young woman
found in north London four days ago

33:07.250 --> 33:11.250
were those of Hayley Louise Reid.

33:11.450 --> 33:16.610
Her parents, Gordon and Suzanne,
have been informed of this...

33:18.450 --> 33:21.170
..and on behalf
of the Metropolitan Police,

33:21.370 --> 33:26.650
we would like to offer our deepest
sympathy to them and their family.

33:27.770 --> 33:31.250
The investigation into
Hayley's death has been reopened...

33:32.370 --> 33:34.810
..and I want to assure
the Reid family

33:34.970 --> 33:36.970
and the wider community

33:37.170 --> 33:40.250
that we will now turn
all of our very best efforts

33:40.450 --> 33:43.410
to finding the person responsible
for this dreadful crime.

33:45.730 --> 33:48.410
Thank you very much.
REPORTERS CLAMOUR

33:48.610 --> 33:50.570
Have the police
made any formal apologises?

33:50.770 --> 33:52.970
DCI Stuart,
why are the police so shit?

33:53.130 --> 33:54.130
ROOM FALLS SILENT

33:56.410 --> 33:58.370
MAN: Did you get that?

33:59.890 --> 34:01.730
What a wanker.

34:01.930 --> 34:05.530
He just wanted a good photo.
I shouldn't have reacted.

34:09.889 --> 34:11.810
WOMAN: DCI Stuart?

34:12.010 --> 34:15.449
She said no questions. What part
of that do you not understand?

34:15.610 --> 34:17.370
I'm... I'm not press.

34:17.530 --> 34:19.010
Hayley was a friend of mine.

34:19.210 --> 34:20.810
And there's something
I need to tell you.

34:23.409 --> 34:27.690
18 years ago, two days
before Hayley went missing...

34:29.210 --> 34:31.370
..when I was supposed to be doing
a cleaning job...

34:33.010 --> 34:36.770
..I was actually in the park
meeting a lad...

34:38.489 --> 34:41.210
..and Hayley, who was a mate...

34:42.409 --> 34:44.330
..did the job for me.

34:45.449 --> 34:48.530
I genuinely... didn't think

34:48.730 --> 34:50.889
the information would be useful
to the investigation,

34:50.929 --> 34:52.650
but I knew if my parents
had have found out,

34:52.810 --> 34:56.489
I'd have been in such deep shit,
so I never told anyone.

34:59.050 --> 35:00.180
Over the years,

35:00.210 --> 35:03.510
I always wondered whether
the information might be relevant.

35:05.330 --> 35:08.690
But... every year that went past,

35:08.890 --> 35:11.970
the easier it became...
to bury it...

35:13.250 --> 35:19.180
...this little... nagging voice
saying I should tell someone.

35:20.010 --> 35:23.810
Oh, and then today, one of
your officers came in to our office,

35:24.010 --> 35:27.090
asking about
our 1999 holiday lettings...

35:29.290 --> 35:31.690
..and my stomach turned...

35:34.810 --> 35:37.130
..because...

35:37.290 --> 35:38.370
the cleaning job...

35:39.890 --> 35:41.530
..it was in a holiday rental.

36:03.810 --> 36:05.370
KNOCK ON DOOR

36:11.710 --> 36:13.870
The property
was called The Spinney,

36:13.910 --> 36:15.890
and she thinks
it's still on the books

36:15.910 --> 36:18.470
of an agency
called Durrell & Martin.

36:18.540 --> 36:20.700
They were one of the ones
we spoke to earlier.

36:20.750 --> 36:23.490
'Well, speak to them again,
call me back.' OK, Guv.

36:33.330 --> 36:36.890
The last 24 hours just made me see
really that it was naive of me

36:37.090 --> 36:41.050
to think that I could live
a normal life with you and Asif,

36:41.250 --> 36:43.170
more importantly
that I could look after you both

36:43.290 --> 36:47.490
when, obviously, I'm still
struggling to look after myself.

36:49.380 --> 36:54.180
Well, I wish now
I'd not... hesitated when you asked

36:54.450 --> 36:57.090
and maybe missed
a wonderful opportunity.

36:57.130 --> 36:59.410
It's OK.
You know, you don't need to.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.340
And the only reason
that I did pause...

37:03.300 --> 37:05.670
..was because I never thought
you saw me that way.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.950
And, of course,
I know you struggle...

37:11.140 --> 37:13.300
SHE SIGHS
..but I do, too.

37:16.060 --> 37:19.130
I think we both have things
in our past that have hurt us.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.880
But I also know
you're a good person, Chris.

37:25.130 --> 37:26.330
Kind...

37:28.570 --> 37:30.210
..and generous

37:30.370 --> 37:32.490
and clever...

37:32.590 --> 37:34.070
who Asif adores.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.780
And, actually,
I would feel very lucky

37:39.830 --> 37:41.810
to be able
to help you grow stronger,

37:41.910 --> 37:43.550
to look after you for a time...

37:45.370 --> 37:47.610
..so that one day soon enough
I'm sure...

37:48.880 --> 37:50.840
..you would be able
to look after us.

38:02.330 --> 38:04.450
Mila!

38:05.650 --> 38:07.370
Mila.

38:07.530 --> 38:09.650
Beautiful girl.

38:10.810 --> 38:12.210
You have no idea.

38:16.050 --> 38:18.730
DOG BARKS

38:18.890 --> 38:21.530
It's Frank. Frank's back!

38:21.690 --> 38:23.010
THEY LAUGH

38:26.810 --> 38:28.450
Paper?
INDISTINCT REPLY

38:45.810 --> 38:47.210
All of it?

38:47.410 --> 38:50.090
Pete, it was three grand.
Exactly!

38:50.250 --> 38:52.210
Oh! The boiler will be two...

38:53.810 --> 38:56.370
..we haven't paid any bills
since October,

38:56.570 --> 38:58.730
and both the boys
needed winter clothes.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.690
Right, sure,
but I'm surprised at the...

39:01.850 --> 39:03.490
Surprised at what?

39:03.650 --> 39:05.210
This isn't Hong Kong, you know,

39:05.410 --> 39:09.610
whatever weird, endlessly delayed
adolescence you lived over there,

39:09.650 --> 39:12.450
which, frankly, freaks me out
the more I think about it.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.490
This is your life now,
and it costs money, constantly,

39:15.690 --> 39:18.650
which has to be earned,
with hard work, constantly.

39:20.530 --> 39:22.450
It's been six years, Pete.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.450
You have responsibilities.

39:24.610 --> 39:26.530
Start living up to them.

39:29.690 --> 39:32.770
Dad, we discussed it last night.
We absolutely did not.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.650
You said you could do the afternoon,
but you couldn't do the morning

39:35.690 --> 39:37.290
because Jenny
had a doctor's appointment.

39:37.490 --> 39:39.690
That's why
I booked the plumber for two.

39:39.890 --> 39:42.170
I suppose there's no chance
it was YOU who made a mistake?

39:42.290 --> 39:44.050
I suppose
it always has to be my fault?

39:44.250 --> 39:46.810
Oh! Fine, forget about it.
I'll get him to come Saturday.

39:52.890 --> 39:55.130
So what did you guys get up to
today?

39:58.850 --> 40:01.330
We went clothes shopping.
Mm.

40:01.530 --> 40:03.890
Early birthday pressie for Jenny.
Very nice.

40:05.290 --> 40:07.770
She like Primark, too, does she?

40:07.930 --> 40:09.010
Harvey Nick's, actually.

40:08.870 --> 40:10.150
Bloody hell, Dad,

40:10.350 --> 40:12.990
she does know you have
a heart condition, doesn't she?

40:13.150 --> 40:15.630
Actually, it was my idea.

40:15.830 --> 40:17.670
And, tell you what,
it was really nice

40:17.830 --> 40:19.270
to be able to treat someone again.

40:19.430 --> 40:20.670
Yeah, I bet.

40:20.830 --> 40:22.350
She's a lucky woman.

40:22.510 --> 40:23.550
Not as lucky as me.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.990
You hungry?
Starving.

40:34.590 --> 40:37.070
I'd forgotten
that's who we let it to.

40:37.230 --> 40:38.750
James Hollis?

40:38.910 --> 40:41.590
That's THE James Hollis, the TV guy.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.230
I don't watch a lot of television.

40:43.390 --> 40:45.510
Well, he's mainly a journalist,

40:45.550 --> 40:49.030
but he also does that quiz show
on the BBC.

40:50.430 --> 40:53.790
SHE CHUCKLES
Well, anyway, that's him.

40:53.950 --> 40:56.670
Took The Spinney for the Millennium

40:56.830 --> 41:00.390
from the 27th to the 2nd, erm...

41:00.590 --> 41:02.470
along with...
yeah, three other families.

41:04.310 --> 41:07.630
Do you mind if I get a copy of that,
please? Yeah.

41:19.470 --> 41:20.990
SHE SIGHS

41:23.390 --> 41:25.230
Boss.

41:25.390 --> 41:26.630
Hey.

41:26.790 --> 41:29.670
Oh, man, a teenager's diary.

41:29.870 --> 41:33.270
So much angst, so much joy.
Mm.

41:33.470 --> 41:36.080
Yeah, I flicked through it last
night. It's not an easy read, is it?

41:36.110 --> 41:37.750
No. What's up?

41:37.950 --> 41:40.230
Murray found the bloke
who rented the house.

41:40.430 --> 41:41.710
Oh, wow, good work.
Yeah.

41:41.910 --> 41:44.550
And he only lives,
er, 15-minute walk from here,

41:44.750 --> 41:46.750
so I thought why don't we just
head down there now?

41:47.870 --> 41:49.790
What, NOW now?
Yeah, why not?

41:51.030 --> 41:52.710
Yeah, why not.

41:55.550 --> 41:57.550
Guess who it is.
Who?

41:57.750 --> 42:01.150
James Hollis.
What, the, er, writer guy?

42:01.310 --> 42:02.310
Yep.

42:02.430 --> 42:03.710
The TV guy?
Yeah!

42:03.870 --> 42:04.870
Blimey.

42:06.270 --> 42:08.230
My mum used to love him.

42:08.430 --> 42:10.990
"Thinking woman's muffin",
she always called him.

42:11.190 --> 42:15.390
I'd say, "Mum, it's crumpet,"
and she'd say, "I know what I mean."

42:17.550 --> 42:19.750
I don't even know why that's funny.

43:29.670 --> 43:30.950
BELL TINKLES

43:32.070 --> 43:33.150
I'll get it.

43:47.470 --> 43:51.150
Hello. Have we got the right address
for James Hollis, please?

43:52.670 --> 43:54.830
Thank you, Lin.

43:54.990 --> 43:56.310
Hello?

43:56.470 --> 43:57.670
Hi, Mr Hollis?

43:57.870 --> 44:02.270
Yes.
DCI Cass Stuart and DI Sunny Khan.

44:02.470 --> 44:05.070
We wondered
if you had five minutes, please,

44:05.270 --> 44:06.950
to help us with a case
we're investigating.

44:07.070 --> 44:08.110
What case?

44:08.310 --> 44:11.190
Er... Well,
it's an historical murder case,

44:11.390 --> 44:15.390
and we just wanted to ask
some questions

44:15.550 --> 44:17.230
about a house we believe you rented

44:17.430 --> 44:21.030
near Middenham
in late December 1999.

44:22.470 --> 44:24.070
I will be more than happy

44:24.270 --> 44:26.510
to answer absolutely any questions
you want to ask me,

44:26.710 --> 44:28.710
but I will need my lawyer present,
I'm afraid.

44:28.870 --> 44:31.110
Oh, OK.

44:31.270 --> 44:32.750
It's really just an informal chat.

44:32.950 --> 44:34.830
We're trying to get
some background information.

44:35.030 --> 44:37.630
Give me your card and I'll get
my lawyer to make an appointment.

44:37.790 --> 44:39.550
No problem.

44:39.750 --> 44:42.070
There you go.
As soon as you can, please.

44:42.230 --> 44:44.110
Absolutely. Thank you. Bye-bye.

44:48.630 --> 44:50.590
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

44:51.910 --> 44:53.910
Interesting.
Very.

44:58.350 --> 44:59.790
Who was it?

45:02.850 --> 45:05.050
Amazon. A book I ordered.

45:10.590 --> 45:12.070
Els, it's Dad again.

45:17.550 --> 45:19.150
It's happened, sweetheart.

45:20.710 --> 45:23.830
They've come. The police.

45:25.670 --> 45:26.870
About her.
