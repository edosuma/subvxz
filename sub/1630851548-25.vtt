THE YEARS, I THINK PEOPLE FORGET

07:43.533 --> 07:44.766
IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE REST

07:44.833 --> 07:46.400
OF AFGHANISTAN, RURAL PARTS OF

08:18.300 --> 08:20.866
WERE THERE BEFORE.

08:20.933 --> 08:24.633
HAS ANYTHING TAKEN ROOT IS MY

08:24.700 --> 08:24.900
QUESTION.

08:24.966 --> 08:25.633
I IMAGINE IF THE TALIBAN GO BACK

08:25.700 --> 08:28.700
TO THEIR WAYS, THE THOUGHT THAT

08:28.766 --> 08:30.866
IT'S GOING TO BE KIND OF A SHOCK

08:30.933 --> 08:32.833
TO 70% OF THE POPULATION COULD

08:32.900 --> 08:34.266
MEAN A VERY DIFFERENT OUTCOME

08:34.333 --> 08:35.666
THAN WHAT WE ARE PICTURING.

08:35.733 --> 08:37.333

08:37.400 --> 08:39.033
DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE

08:55.266 --> 08:57.666
LIKE THIS IN KABUL.

08:57.733 --> 08:59.333

08:59.400 --> 09:00.733
GOING TO LAST?

09:00.800 --> 09:02.333
>> NOBODY KNOWS AND WHEN THE

09:03.966 --> 09:05.200
ALREADY SAID THEY ARE BANNING

09:05.266 --> 09:06.866
MUSIC AGAIN AND THESE ARE THE

09:06.933 --> 09:07.466
PEOPLE WHO BAND THE KITES AND

09:07.533 --> 09:09.600
THEY TOLD THE WOMEN TO GO HOME

09:09.666 --> 09:10.900
ALREADY.

09:10.966 --> 09:11.900
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE FAST.

09:11.966 --> 09:13.266

09:13.333 --> 09:14.333

09:14.400 --> 09:16.433
ALL THEIR RIGHTS WITHIN THE

09:16.500 --> 09:17.533
LIMITS OF ISLAM, WHICH IS A

09:17.600 --> 09:20.466
GREAT WAY OF SAYING NONE.

09:20.533 --> 09:21.666
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

09:21.733 --> 09:22.866
>> Bill: I NEVER UNDERSTAND

09:22.933 --> 09:23.466
WHY THE LIBERALS ESPECIALLY IN

09:23.533 --> 09:26.066
THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT MORE

09:26.133 --> 09:29.800
APOPLECTIC ABOUT THE WAYS -- THE

09:29.866 --> 09:30.433
FEMINISTS ARE TREATED IN SO MUCH

09:30.500 --> 09:36.266
OF THE WORLD.

09:36.333 --> 09:37.066
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

09:37.133 --> 09:38.033
ESPECIALLY THIS PART OF THE

09:38.100 --> 09:38.300
WORLD TO.

09:38.366 --> 09:41.100
>> THIS IS THE BIG QUESTION ,

09:41.166 --> 09:42.900
RIGHT? WHY DID WE GO TO

09:42.966 --> 09:43.900
AFGHANISTAN?

09:43.966 --> 09:44.566
WHAT WAS THE MISSION?

09:44.633 --> 09:46.166
>> Bill: THE MISSION WAS TO

09:46.233 --> 09:46.766
STOP THEM FROM PLANNING WHICH

09:46.833 --> 09:49.633
WAS A STUPID IDEA, THEY PLANNED

09:49.700 --> 09:50.900
IT IN HAMBURG, GERMANY.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.200
YOU CAN PLAN IT ANYWHERE, YOU

09:52.266 --> 09:54.400
DON'T NEED TO BE IN AFGHANISTAN.

09:54.466 --> 09:56.033
THEN THEY SHOW THE FILM ON THE

09:56.100 --> 09:58.500
NEWS OF THE TERRORISTS ON THE

09:58.566 --> 10:00.166
MONKEY BARS.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.700
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

10:01.766 --> 10:03.533
>> Bill: AND THEN WE SENT ALL

10:03.600 --> 10:04.533
THE MONEY AND THE TROOPS.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.333
>> Bill: WE GOT FIXED IN THAT

10:06.400 --> 10:07.500
TUNNEL VISION, THAT MIND-SET

10:07.566 --> 10:08.600
THAT BIN LADEN WAS IN

10:08.666 --> 10:09.700
AFGHANISTAN WE'VE GOT TO GO

10:09.766 --> 10:11.066
THERE AND WE HAVE TO STAY THERE

10:11.133 --> 10:12.566
UNTIL WE CAN SAY IT WILL NEVER

10:12.633 --> 10:15.100
HAPPEN AGAIN, WHICH OF COURSE

10:15.166 --> 10:16.533
MEANS WE WILL BE THERE FOREVER.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.300
>> Bill: RIGHT.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.433
YOUR BOOK IS SORT OF THE MODERN

10:19.500 --> 10:20.766
PENTAGON PAPERS, IT IS

10:20.833 --> 10:23.200
ASTOUNDING AND SAD HOW SIMILAR

10:23.266 --> 10:25.466
THIS PLAYED OUT TO VIETNAM.

10:25.533 --> 10:27.433
IT'S LIKE WE JUST DID THIS SHIT

10:27.500 --> 10:29.100
AND THEN WE DID IT AGAIN, WE

10:29.166 --> 10:31.900
FORGET -- ONE GENERATION DOESN'T

10:31.966 --> 10:33.466
THE PORTLY FORGET, BUT WE SHOULD

10:33.533 --> 10:35.366
TEACH HISTORY IN SCHOOL, MAYBE,

10:35.433 --> 10:37.166
MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP.

10:37.233 --> 10:42.033
[APPLAUSE]

10:42.100 --> 10:43.666
YOUR NEW PENTAGON PAPERS BOOK

10:43.733 --> 10:45.233
HAS THE SAME THEME WHICH IS THEY

10:45.300 --> 10:47.700
LIED TO US OR THEY PRESENTED A

10:47.766 --> 10:49.400
ROSY PICTURE IN PUBLIC FOR ALL

10:49.466 --> 10:51.100
THESE YEARS AND BEHIND THE

10:51.166 --> 10:52.800
SCENES, THEY KNEW IT WAS

10:52.866 --> 10:54.133
UNWINNABLE AND THEY JUST WEREN'T

10:54.200 --> 10:56.066
TELLING US, LIARS.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.600
>> THIS ONE, FROM THE BEGINNING

10:58.666 --> 10:59.566
REALLY.

10:59.633 --> 11:00.533
MEMOS WE OBTAINED FROM DONALD

11:00.600 --> 11:02.266
RUMSFELD WHO WAS BUSH'S EVENT

11:02.333 --> 11:04.600
SECRETARY AND IN PUBLIC PEOPLE

11:04.666 --> 11:05.766
WERE ASKING THEM IS THIS GOING

11:05.833 --> 11:08.433
TO BE ANOTHER VIETNAM AND

11:08.500 --> 11:09.900
RUMSFELD WOULD MAKE FUN OF

11:09.966 --> 11:11.100
JOURNALISTS WHO WOULD ASK THIS,

11:11.166 --> 11:12.800
THEN IN PRIVATE SIX MONTHS IN

11:12.866 --> 11:15.400
THE WAR HE SENDS A MEMO TO HIS

11:15.466 --> 11:18.166
MILITARY CHIEF SAYING IF WE

11:18.233 --> 11:19.633
DON'T GET A PLAN TO STABILIZE

11:19.700 --> 11:20.366
AFGHANISTAN, OUR TROOPS ARE

11:20.433 --> 11:21.700
GOING TO GET STUCK THERE

11:21.766 --> 11:22.600
FOREVER.

11:22.666 --> 11:25.100
HE ENDS THE MEMO WITH ONE WORD,

11:25.166 --> 11:29.533
HELP!

11:29.600 --> 11:32.833
YOU SEE THIS IN THE PUBLIC,

11:32.900 --> 11:34.233
THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER, WE

11:34.300 --> 11:35.766
ARE TURNING THE CORNER AND YET

11:35.833 --> 11:37.433
IN PRIVATE, AND DIPLOMATIC

11:37.500 --> 11:41.233
CABLES, MEMOS, INTERNALLY YOU'RE

11:41.300 --> 11:44.466
SAYING THINGS ARE A MESS AND

11:44.533 --> 11:46.700
SLOWLY THIS WAR IS SLIPPING FROM

11:46.766 --> 11:48.866
THEIR GRASP, IT'S GRADUALLY

11:48.933 --> 11:49.300
BECOMING UNWINNABLE.

11:49.366 --> 11:51.233
>> Bill: THE ONE THAT

11:51.300 --> 11:52.233
MYSTIFIES ME IS OBAMA.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.866
OBAMA RAN AND I LOVED IT WHEN HE

11:53.933 --> 11:56.500
SAID I'M NOT AGAINST ALL WARS,

11:56.566 --> 11:57.200
I'M AGAINST DUMB WARS.

11:57.266 --> 11:59.633
I'M LIKE THAT IS MY GUY, BECAUSE

11:59.700 --> 12:00.600
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

12:00.666 --> 12:02.366
YOU CAN'T BE AGAINST ALL WARS,

12:02.433 --> 12:04.233
THERE IS EVIL IN THE WORLD,

12:04.300 --> 12:09.366
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE A BAD

12:09.433 --> 12:09.966
ASS AND AMERICA HAS MORE THAN

12:10.033 --> 12:11.300
NOT STEPPED UP.

12:11.366 --> 12:12.866
[APPLAUSE]

12:12.933 --> 12:14.666
BUT THIS WAS A DUMB WAR AND HE

12:14.733 --> 12:17.833
KIND OF DOUBLED DOWN ON IT.

12:17.900 --> 12:18.400
HOW COULD A GUY THAT BRIGHT

12:18.466 --> 12:21.866
THINK YOU COULD DO WHAT WE WERE

12:21.933 --> 12:24.500
TRYING TO DO, SURGE, TAKE OVER

12:24.566 --> 12:26.233
THE COUNTRY, FLOOD IT WITH MONEY

12:26.300 --> 12:27.466
AND THAT WOULD CHANGE THINGS

12:27.533 --> 12:28.866
AROUND WHEN REALLY IT WAS JUST

12:28.933 --> 12:30.500
DOING THE OPPOSITE, WHAT'S YOUR

12:30.566 --> 12:31.733
TAKE ON THAT?

12:31.800 --> 12:32.866
>> OBAMA YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER

12:32.933 --> 12:35.300
WHEN HE RAN FOR OFFICE THE FIRST

12:35.366 --> 12:36.166
TIME, HE WAS SAYING IRAQ WAS THE

12:36.233 --> 12:39.133
DUMB WAR AND WE ARE GOING TO GET

12:39.200 --> 12:40.066
OUT OF IRAQ AND HE DID

12:40.133 --> 12:42.733
EVENTUALLY PULL TROOPS OUT OF

12:42.800 --> 12:44.033
IRAQ.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.500
>> Bill: AND HE SAID

12:45.566 --> 12:45.800
AFGHANISTAN.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.200
>> WHEN HE FIRST RAN HE SAID IT

12:47.266 --> 12:50.100
WAS THE JUST WAR, THIS WAS THE

12:50.166 --> 12:51.300
JUST CAUSE, A WAR OF

12:51.366 --> 12:53.066
SELF-DEFENSE ORIGINALLY BECAUSE

12:53.133 --> 12:53.500
OF SEPTEMBER 11TH.

12:53.566 --> 12:55.033
>> Bill: THAT WAR WAS ALREADY

12:55.100 --> 12:56.533
OVER FOR MANY YEARS BY THE TIME

12:56.600 --> 12:57.666
HE GOT THERE.

12:57.733 --> 13:01.133
IF IT WAS A JUST WAR --

13:01.200 --> 13:01.900
CERTAINLY AFTER HE GOT

13:01.966 --> 13:04.533
BIN LADEN, WHAT WAS LEFT TO DO?

13:04.600 --> 13:07.100
IT MORPHED INTO NATION-BUILDING,

13:07.166 --> 13:08.133
MORPHED INTO THIS RIDICULOUS

13:08.200 --> 13:10.500
IDEA AS IN VIETNAM WE COULD

13:10.566 --> 13:12.466
CHANGE HEARTS AND MINDS WHEN THE

13:12.533 --> 13:13.733
THINGS WE WERE DOING THERE, YOU

13:13.800 --> 13:16.333
ONLY LOSE HEARTS AND MINDS.

13:16.400 --> 13:23.900
>> EACH PRESIDENT, PROMISED WE

13:23.966 --> 13:24.433
AREN'T NATION-BUILDING IN

13:24.500 --> 13:25.466
AFGHANISTAN EVEN THOUGH AT THE

13:25.533 --> 13:26.933
VERY MOMENT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

13:27.000 --> 13:28.333
WE WERE DOING.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.433
THE UNITED STATES SPENT MORE

13:31.500 --> 13:32.166
THAN $100 BILLION

13:32.233 --> 13:32.800
NATION-BUILDING IN AFGHANISTAN,

13:32.866 --> 13:35.700
THAT'S MORE THAN WE SPENT IN

13:35.766 --> 13:36.900
EUROPE ON THE MARSHALL PLAN

13:36.966 --> 13:37.333
AFTER WORLD WAR II.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.000
NOW IT'S ALL DONE UP IN SMOKE.

13:39.066 --> 13:40.700
>> Bill: THIS IS WHAT I KEEP

13:40.766 --> 13:42.066
SAYING EVERY WEEK, BECAUSE WE

13:42.133 --> 13:44.066
WANTED TO, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

13:44.133 --> 13:45.066
THE MONEY WAS.

13:45.133 --> 13:47.466
ROSS PEROT USED AS TALK ABOUT

13:47.533 --> 13:48.900
THE GIANT SUCKING SOUND WHICH IS

13:48.966 --> 13:50.366
JOBS GOING TO SOUTH AMERICA AND

13:50.433 --> 13:53.266
MEXICO -- THE GIANT SUCKING

13:53.333 --> 13:54.266
SOUND IS ANY PLACE YOU HAVE A

13:54.333 --> 13:56.500
WAR WHERE THE MONEY JUST

13:56.566 --> 13:59.100
DISAPPEARS IN GIANT CASELOADS OF

13:59.166 --> 13:59.666
CASH.

13:59.733 --> 14:01.633
OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

14:01.700 --> 14:03.733
PEOPLE, DEFENSE CONTRACTORS AND

14:03.800 --> 14:05.233
EVERYBODY ELSE, LET'S GO TO THE

14:05.300 --> 14:07.033
PLACE WITH THE MONEY IS, WHERE

14:07.100 --> 14:08.300
NO ONE'S KEEPING TRACK OF IT.

14:08.366 --> 14:10.433
>> IN SOME WAYS IT WAS EVEN

14:10.500 --> 14:11.800
WORSE THAN YOU THINK.

14:11.866 --> 14:15.366
>> Bill: OWE GOD.

14:15.433 --> 14:17.833
[LAUGHTER]

14:17.900 --> 14:19.966
THE DOCUMENTS WE GOT FROM

14:20.033 --> 14:22.633
AFGHANISTAN PAPERS, WE HAVE

14:22.700 --> 14:24.833
TESTIMONIALS, ARMY OFFICERS, AID

14:24.900 --> 14:25.733
WORKERS SAYING WE WERE SPENDING

14:25.800 --> 14:26.800
MONEY SO FAST WE DIDN'T KNOW

14:26.866 --> 14:28.033
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.400
WE WERE BUILDING SCHOOLS WHERE

14:29.466 --> 14:31.400
THERE WAS NO NEED FOR IT, WE

14:31.466 --> 14:33.066
WERE BUILDING PROJECTS THAT WERE

14:33.133 --> 14:33.833
GHOST PROJECTS, THROWING MONEY

14:33.900 --> 14:34.933
AT IT TO SAY WE COULD DO IT EVEN

14:35.000 --> 14:38.433
THOUGH THE WHOLE TIME WE KNEW IT

14:38.500 --> 14:38.800
WASN'T GOING TO.

14:38.866 --> 14:40.500
>> Bill: I THINK I READ IN

14:40.566 --> 14:41.900
YOUR BOOK 18% OF THE MONEY WENT

14:41.966 --> 14:44.233
TO THE TALIBAN BECAUSE IT WAS A

14:44.300 --> 14:44.800
GIANT PROTECTION RACKET, YOU

14:44.866 --> 14:46.666
COULD MOVE AROUND UNLESS YOU

14:46.733 --> 14:48.466
PAID OFF THE TALIBAN, WE WERE

14:48.533 --> 14:49.533
PAYING THE PEOPLE -- IT'S LIKE

14:49.600 --> 14:51.933
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING DIVORCED AND

14:52.000 --> 14:54.233
YOU'VE GOT TO PAY FOR YOUR

14:54.300 --> 14:58.066
SPOUSE'S ATTORNEY.

14:58.133 --> 14:58.333
[LAUGHTER]

14:58.400 --> 15:00.866
[APPLAUSE]

15:00.933 --> 15:02.066
NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW.

15:02.133 --> 15:03.166
>> IN SOME WAYS IT WAS WORSE

15:03.233 --> 15:05.200
THAN YOU THINK, THERE WAS ONE

15:05.266 --> 15:07.633
STORY AN ARMY OFFICER SAID IN

15:07.700 --> 15:09.500
ONE PROVINCE THERE WAS A RACKET

15:09.566 --> 15:11.700
GOING ON WHERE WE WOULD BUILD A

15:11.766 --> 15:13.000
BRIDGE, THE TALIBAN WOULD COME

15:13.066 --> 15:14.366
UP AND BLOW UP THE BRIDGE AND

15:14.433 --> 15:16.266
THE LOCAL AFGHAN OFFICIAL WHO

15:16.333 --> 15:18.033
WAS OUR FRIEND WOULD SAY "OKAY,

15:18.100 --> 15:19.766
I NEED MONEY TO BUILD THE BRIDGE

15:19.833 --> 15:21.066
BACK UP."

15:21.133 --> 15:23.766
BUT HIS BROTHER WAS WITH THE

15:23.833 --> 15:25.566
TALIBAN, THEY HAD THIS RACKET

15:25.633 --> 15:27.166
WHERE THEY KEPT BLOWING UP THE

15:27.233 --> 15:29.233
BRIDGE, WE KEPT REBUILDING THIS

15:29.300 --> 15:31.000
TIME AND AGAIN, THAT IS

15:31.066 --> 15:31.833
AFGHANISTAN IN A NUTSHELL.

15:31.900 --> 15:32.966
>> Bill: IT SOUNDS LIKE A JUDD

15:33.033 --> 15:33.966
APATOW COMEDY AND YOU KIND OF

15:34.033 --> 15:36.400
LOOK LIKE HIM, YOU COULD DIRECT

15:36.466 --> 15:39.233
IT.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.233
IT SEEMS LIKE REAGAN AND BUSH,

15:41.300 --> 15:43.033
BUSH THE FIRST, THEY WERE THE

15:43.100 --> 15:46.033
TWO PRESIDENTS, THE BEIRUT

15:46.100 --> 15:46.733
BOMBING, REPUBLICANS LOVE TO SAY

15:46.800 --> 15:49.200
WE CAN NEVER CUT AND RUN.

15:49.266 --> 15:50.966
HE CUT AND RAN, HE'S WENT YOU

15:51.033 --> 15:52.733
KNOW WHAT?

15:52.800 --> 15:56.166
THESE PEOPLE ARE FLOCKING NUTS

15:56.233 --> 15:57.800
NUTS, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

15:57.866 --> 15:59.233
BUSH THE FIRST DID NOT GO ALL

15:59.300 --> 16:00.200
THE WAY TO BAGHDAD, OTHER THAN

16:00.266 --> 16:03.066
THAT, WE NEVER SEEM TO BE ABLE

16:03.133 --> 16:03.333
TO RESIST.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.766
>> YOU TALK ABOUT VIETNAM, JUST

16:04.833 --> 16:07.633
AFTER THE WAR STARTED,

16:07.700 --> 16:08.566
GEORGE W. BUSH WAS ASKED ARE WE

16:08.633 --> 16:09.233
GOING TO GET STUCK IN ANOTHER

16:09.300 --> 16:12.566
VIETNAM AND HE WAS VERY

16:12.633 --> 16:15.833
CONFIDENT ON NATIONAL TV SAID WE

16:15.900 --> 16:16.466
LEARNED OUR LESSONS FROM

16:16.533 --> 16:18.066
VIETNAM, WE AREN'T GOING TO GET

16:18.133 --> 16:19.433
STUCK ESPECIALLY IN AFGHANISTAN,

16:19.500 --> 16:20.900
WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

16:20.966 --> 16:21.533
SOVIETS, WE AREN'T GOING TO LET

16:21.600 --> 16:24.033
THAT HAPPEN TO US.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.033
WE ENDED UP BEING THERE TWICE AS

16:25.100 --> 16:27.166
LONG AS THE RUSSIANS WERE AND

16:27.233 --> 16:29.866
EVEN THEN THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE

16:29.933 --> 16:31.266
IN WASHINGTON WHO WANTED THE WAR

16:31.333 --> 16:33.066
TO KEEP GOING, THEY WANTED TO

16:33.133 --> 16:33.866
KEEP TROOPS THERE AND BIDEN

16:33.933 --> 16:36.866
FINALLY SAID TIME TO PULL OUT.

16:36.933 --> 16:38.500
>> Bill: THANK YOU FOR YOUR

16:38.566 --> 16:40.833
BOOK, IT'S GREAT, IT'S GOING TO

16:40.900 --> 16:41.466
WIN PRICES, WE HOPE FOR BETTER

16:41.533 --> 16:46.666
DAYS IN AFGHANISTAN.

16:46.733 --> 16:49.633
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, CRAIG,

16:49.700 --> 16:51.066
LET'S MEET OUR PANEL!

16:51.133 --> 16:52.966
LOOK WHO IT IS!

16:53.033 --> 16:56.066
HERE IS OUR PANEL.

16:56.133 --> 16:56.866
SHE'S A TV JOURNALIST,

16:56.933 --> 16:57.366
BESTSELLING AUTHOR, AND

16:57.433 --> 16:58.000
WASHINGTON EDITOR FOR OZY MEDIA:

16:58.066 --> 17:01.200
KATTY KAY.

17:01.266 --> 17:04.800
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

17:04.866 --> 17:05.266
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

17:05.333 --> 17:05.900
HE'S A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND

17:05.966 --> 17:06.466
FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE

17:06.533 --> 17:07.400
FAITH & FREEDOM COALITION: RALPH

17:07.466 --> 17:11.933
REED.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.033
[APPLAUSE]

17:16.100 --> 17:17.800
WE CAN'T HELP IT, WE LIKE EACH

17:17.866 --> 17:20.833
OTHER, WE TRY, BUT WE CAN'T.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.033
>> LET'S KEEP IT A SECRET.

17:23.100 --> 17:24.700
>> Bill: WE'LL SEE WHAT

17:24.766 --> 17:27.400
HAPPENS AT THE END OF THE SHOW.

17:27.466 --> 17:28.066
LET'S TALK THE POLITICS ABOUT

17:28.133 --> 17:29.700
THIS FOR A MINUTE.

17:29.766 --> 17:31.233
I SEE TWO DOZEN HOUSE AND SENATE

17:31.300 --> 17:31.933
REPUBLICANS ARE PULLING FOR

17:32.000 --> 17:36.366
BIDEN TO RESIGN OR BE REMOVED.

17:36.433 --> 17:39.400
I JUST MENTIONED BEIRUT, THEY

17:39.466 --> 17:41.566
DIDN'T DO THAT WHEN HE LOST ALL

17:41.633 --> 17:42.433
THE TROOPS IN BEIRUT, THEY

17:42.500 --> 17:44.633
DIDN'T DO IT WITH JIMMY CARTER'S

17:44.700 --> 17:47.066
FIASCO IN IRAN, IT'S A TOUGH

17:47.133 --> 17:49.200
JOB, PRESIDENT, SOMETIMES PEOPLE

17:49.266 --> 17:49.766
DIE ON YOUR WATCH.

17:49.833 --> 17:53.266
MARSHA BLACKBURN, I WAS JUST IN

17:53.333 --> 17:56.766
TENNESSEE, SHE SAYS BIDEN AND

17:56.833 --> 17:58.200
ALSO KAMALA HARRIS, THE WHOLE

17:58.266 --> 17:59.666
THING IS ROTTEN IT'S GOT TO GO,

17:59.733 --> 18:02.166
WHAT DID SHE HAVE TO DO WITH

18:02.233 --> 18:02.366
THIS?

18:02.433 --> 18:03.800
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE IS

18:03.866 --> 18:05.666
STARTING AN IMPEACHMENT

18:05.733 --> 18:06.233
COMMITTEE, JOSH HAWLEY, I LOVE

18:06.300 --> 18:11.433
THIS MOTHERFUCKER.

18:11.500 --> 18:11.700
[LAUGHTER]

18:11.766 --> 18:13.400
IN MAY, HE SAID I THINK WE

18:13.466 --> 18:14.500
SHOULD HAVE LEFT AFGHANISTAN A

18:14.566 --> 18:16.366
LONG TIME AGO, BETTER LATE THAN

18:16.433 --> 18:17.666
NEVER, I THINK PRESIDENT BIDEN

18:17.733 --> 18:18.900
HAS MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.

18:18.966 --> 18:20.400
NOW HE HAS NEED OF THE CAPACITY

18:20.466 --> 18:22.833
NOR THE WILL TO LEAD, HE MUST

18:22.900 --> 18:23.666
RESIGN.

18:23.733 --> 18:24.966
I FEEL LIKE DEMOCRATS DO

18:25.033 --> 18:25.833
DIFFICULT THINGS AND THEN THEY

18:25.900 --> 18:30.033
GET SHIT FOR IT, THE REPUBLICANS

18:30.100 --> 18:31.266
RUN UP THE DEBT AND IN THE

18:31.333 --> 18:31.866
DEMOCRAT COMES IN AND HAS TO

18:31.933 --> 18:33.700
CLEAN THAT UP.

18:33.766 --> 18:35.233
THEY PAY FOR THINGS LIKE

18:35.300 --> 18:36.100
OBAMACARE WAS COMPLETELY PAID

18:36.166 --> 18:38.500
FOR OR THEY GET OUT OF WARS,

18:38.566 --> 18:39.566
BOTH SIDES SAY WE SHOULD GET OUT

18:39.633 --> 18:41.500
OF AND THEN YOU KIND OF USE THAT

18:41.566 --> 18:42.900
AS A CUDGEL AGAINST THEM WHEN

18:42.966 --> 18:43.700
REALLY THEY ARE THE ONES DOING

18:43.766 --> 18:46.233
THE CLEANUP WORK AND THE DIRTY

18:46.300 --> 18:48.933
WORK AND THE RESPONSIBLE ADULT

18:49.000 --> 18:49.500
THINGS.

18:49.566 --> 18:55.200
AND THEN THEY ONLY HAVE TO PAY.

18:55.266 --> 18:57.633
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

18:57.700 --> 18:59.766
>> FIRST OF ALL, IT'S TAKEN

18:59.833 --> 19:03.000
REPUBLICANS A NANOSECOND SINCE

19:03.066 --> 19:04.133
THE ACTUAL ATROCITY, THE BOMBING

19:04.200 --> 19:06.500
AND THE KILLING OF THESE PEOPLE

19:06.566 --> 19:07.133
TO BRING POLITICS INTO THE

19:07.200 --> 19:10.433
CONVERSATION, THE FAMILY --

19:10.500 --> 19:11.400
POLITICS HAS RAISED ITS UGLY

19:11.466 --> 19:12.833
HEAD IN A PARTICULAR WAY, IT'S

19:12.900 --> 19:14.066
VERY HARD FOR HER REPUBLICANS TO

19:14.133 --> 19:15.633
MAKE A CASE ON THIS ONE BECAUSE

19:15.700 --> 19:17.766
THEY STOOD BY DONALD TRUMP.

19:17.833 --> 19:18.800
KEVIN McCARTHY EVEN IN THE

19:18.866 --> 19:20.300
COURSE OF THIS WEEK SEEMS TO BE

19:20.366 --> 19:21.966
SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE ALL THE

19:22.033 --> 19:22.500
TROOPS OUT BUT ACTUALLY WE

19:22.566 --> 19:27.300
SHOULD SECURE WHICH WOULD TAKE

19:27.366 --> 19:28.566
SEVERAL THOUSAND TROOPS, HE

19:28.633 --> 19:29.433
DOESN'T SEEM TO KNOW HIMSELF

19:29.500 --> 19:31.066
WHAT HE WANTS THE TROOPS IN OR

19:31.133 --> 19:32.900
WHETHER HE WANTS THE TROOPS OUT,

19:32.966 --> 19:34.400
HE WENT ALONG WITH

19:34.466 --> 19:35.133
DONALD TRUMP -- DONALD TRUMP

19:35.200 --> 19:37.100
SIGNED A STEEL BACK IN

19:37.166 --> 19:39.000
FEBRUARY 2020 WHICH INCLUDED THE

19:39.066 --> 19:40.233
RELEASE OF 5,000 TALIBAN

19:40.300 --> 19:41.466
PRISONERS WHICH IS WHERE YOU GET

19:41.533 --> 19:42.833
THE ATROCITY THAT WE GOT IN THE

19:42.900 --> 19:45.666
ATTACK THIS WEEK.

19:45.733 --> 19:46.966
IT WAS DONALD TRUMP'S DEAL AND

19:47.033 --> 19:49.366
THEY SIGNED ON TO IT, IT'S A BIT

19:49.433 --> 19:50.600
MUCH FOR THEM TO SAY --

19:50.666 --> 19:52.200
>> Bill: I'M GLAD WE ARE ALL

19:52.266 --> 19:52.633
IN AGREEMENT.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.266
>> WE ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT.

19:55.333 --> 19:55.566
>> Bill: NO?

19:55.633 --> 19:58.000
>> I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR

19:58.066 --> 19:59.400
VIEWERS TO GO ONLINE AND

19:59.466 --> 20:01.233
ACTUALLY READ THE AGREEMENT,

20:01.300 --> 20:02.066
READ THE AGREEMENT THAT THE

20:02.133 --> 20:03.933
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NEGOTIATED.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.800
IT WAS CONDITIONS BASED.

20:06.866 --> 20:09.000
IT REQUIRED THE TALIBAN TO BREAK

20:09.066 --> 20:12.800
ALL TIES WITH AL QAEDA, WITH

20:12.866 --> 20:14.233
ISIS AND WITH OTHER TERRORIST

20:14.300 --> 20:15.633
INFRASTRUCTURES, THEY FAILED TO

20:15.700 --> 20:16.633
DO SO.

20:16.700 --> 20:17.833
THEY ALSO SAID THEY COULDN'T

20:17.900 --> 20:19.433
LAUNCH ANY ATTACKS, THEY FAILED

20:19.500 --> 20:22.400
TO DO THAT.

20:22.466 --> 20:23.000
IT MADE CLEAR THAT BAGRAM WAS

20:23.066 --> 20:25.666
GOING TO BE EVACUATED LAST, THAT

20:25.733 --> 20:27.966
WAS MEANT TO BE LESS FACILITY WE

20:28.033 --> 20:28.733
LEFT, WHY?

20:28.800 --> 20:31.566
BECAUSE THAT FACILITY WAS WHERE

20:31.633 --> 20:32.600
WE PROVIDED COUNTERINTELLIGENCE,

20:32.666 --> 20:33.366
DRONE, AIR SUPPORT, IT WAS

20:33.433 --> 20:37.433
NECESSARY TO KEEP THE AFGHAN

20:37.500 --> 20:39.933
FORCES ALIVE AND WHEN JOE BIDEN,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.033
NOT DONALD TRUMP, WHEN JOE BIDEN

20:42.100 --> 20:44.200
CUT AND RUN OUT OF THAT FACILITY

20:44.266 --> 20:48.033
AND LEFT $350 MILLION IN ARMORED

20:48.100 --> 20:50.433
PERSONNEL CARRIERS AND

20:50.500 --> 20:52.066
NIGHT VISION GOGGLES AND OTHER

20:52.133 --> 20:53.333
SENSITIVE, EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT

20:53.400 --> 20:55.866
THERE, HE NOT ONLY HANDED THE

20:55.933 --> 20:56.833
DEATH CERTIFICATE FOR

20:56.900 --> 20:59.100
AFGHANISTAN TO THE TALIBAN, HE

20:59.166 --> 21:01.233
SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE

21:01.300 --> 21:03.166
AFGHAN FORCES WE ARE DONE, WE

21:03.233 --> 21:04.166
ARE FINISHED, HE OWNS THE WHOLE

21:04.233 --> 21:06.466
THING.

21:06.533 --> 21:09.166
IF TRYING TO BLAME HIS

21:09.233 --> 21:09.933
PREDECESSOR ONLY MAKES IT WORSE.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.100
>> HE SIGNED A DEAL THAT WAS

21:12.166 --> 21:13.400
SUCH A BAD DEAL THAT THE TALIBAN

21:13.466 --> 21:14.833
WAS NEVER GOING TO WORK ON THE

21:14.900 --> 21:16.033
GROUND, THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO

21:16.100 --> 21:19.200
CUT THEIR TIES WITH AL QAEDA,

21:19.266 --> 21:19.866
THE 5,000 PRISONERS THAT WERE

21:19.933 --> 21:20.933
RELEASED AS PART OF THAT DEAL

21:21.000 --> 21:22.300
WITH THE KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT

21:22.366 --> 21:24.200
WERE GOING TO COME AROUND AND

21:24.266 --> 21:26.166
ATTACK THE AMERICANS IF THEY

21:26.233 --> 21:28.333
COULD DO -- YOU SEEM TO BE

21:28.400 --> 21:29.433
SUGGESTING THAT DONALD TRUMP

21:29.500 --> 21:30.566
SIGNED A TERRIBLE DEAL AND

21:30.633 --> 21:31.733
PERHAPS JOE BIDEN SHOULDN'T HAVE

21:31.800 --> 21:33.166
STUCK TO THAT DEAL.

21:33.233 --> 21:34.633
IF THERE WERE CLAUSES THAT THE

21:34.700 --> 21:35.833
TALIBAN HAVEN'T STUCK TO ADMIT

21:35.900 --> 21:36.833
THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE STUCK TO

21:36.900 --> 21:39.200
THE DEAL AT ALL, THAT WOULD BE

21:39.266 --> 21:40.766
THE ARGUMENT --

21:40.833 --> 21:42.366
>> I'M NOT SAYING HE SHOULD HAVE

21:42.433 --> 21:43.700
STUCK TO THE DEAL, THAT ISN'T

21:43.766 --> 21:44.466
WHAT I SAID TO.

21:44.533 --> 21:46.166
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE DEAL WAS

21:46.233 --> 21:48.400
CONDITIONS BASED IN IT WAS

21:48.466 --> 21:49.600
SEQUENTIAL.

21:49.666 --> 21:50.366
WE DID CERTAIN THINGS AFTER THEY

21:50.433 --> 21:52.766
KEPT THEIR WORD.

21:52.833 --> 21:56.300
>> Bill: IT'S THE TALIBAN.

21:56.366 --> 21:57.933
>> WHEN THEY FAILED TO LIVE UP

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
TO THEIR END OF THEIR DEAL.

21:59.066 --> 22:00.366
>> Bill: WHO GIVES A FUCK

22:00.433 --> 22:06.166
ABOUT THE DEAL?

22:06.233 --> 22:08.400
>> 37 MILLION AFGHANS CARED

22:08.466 --> 22:08.933
ABOUT THE DEAL.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.100
>> Bill: WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT

22:10.166 --> 22:12.266
IS LIVING IN A PEACEFUL COUNTRY

22:12.333 --> 22:13.833
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY THEY CAN'T

22:13.900 --> 22:15.400
GET FOR THEMSELVES WHICH I FEEL

22:15.466 --> 22:17.733
BAD ABOUT BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OUR

22:17.800 --> 22:18.333
FAULT.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.966
WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION,

22:20.033 --> 22:21.866
THE OLD ADMINISTRATION WAS A

22:21.933 --> 22:25.100
CRAZY MAN.

22:25.166 --> 22:25.366
[APPLAUSE]

22:25.433 --> 22:32.366
HE MADE A DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO

22:32.433 --> 22:32.966
WERE NEVER GOING TO ABIDE BY ANY

22:33.033 --> 22:33.166
DEAL.

22:33.233 --> 22:33.766
THEY ARE THE TALIBAN, THEY'RE

22:33.833 --> 22:35.400
LAUGHING AT A DEAL.

22:35.466 --> 22:36.666
JOE BIDEN, YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M NOT

22:36.733 --> 22:38.766
ARGUING WITH YOUR MAIN POINT I

22:38.833 --> 22:39.966
SAID IT LAST WEEK, I DON'T KNOW

22:40.033 --> 22:41.933
HOW IT COULD HAVE GONE WORSE

22:42.000 --> 22:42.833
UNDER TRUMP.

22:42.900 --> 22:44.266
WHY DID WE PULL OUT THE SECURITY

22:44.333 --> 22:45.533
GUARD BEFORE WE GOT THE PEOPLE

22:45.600 --> 22:51.300
OUT OF THE DISCO?

22:51.366 --> 22:53.333
IT WAS DONE HORRIBLY.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.966
IT DEPRESSES ME A LOT.

22:57.033 --> 22:58.066
THE ADULTS TAKE OVER AND THEY

22:58.133 --> 22:58.733
CAN'T DO BETTER THAN WHAT THE

22:58.800 --> 23:03.966
CHILDREN WERE DOING.

23:04.033 --> 23:06.566
EXECUTION, F, ABSOLUTELY.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.000
MY QUESTION IS HOW LONG DOES

23:08.066 --> 23:09.733
THIS STICK TO JOE BIDEN?

23:09.800 --> 23:10.600
WHAT IS THE POLITICAL

23:10.666 --> 23:11.800
RAMIFICATIONS, HOW DOES IT

23:11.866 --> 23:13.100
AFFECT PEOPLE IN THE ELECTION

23:13.166 --> 23:14.866
COMING UP IN A YEAR?

23:14.933 --> 23:17.100
IS THIS GOING TO BE AN ALBATROSS

23:17.166 --> 23:18.233
AROUND EVERY DEMOCRATS NECK?

23:18.300 --> 23:23.033
I'M SURE THEY'RE GOING TO TRY.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.633
IT IS?

23:24.700 --> 23:24.866
>> YES.

23:24.933 --> 23:26.200
>> WE'LL HAVE TO SEE WHETHER THE

23:26.266 --> 23:30.133
EVENTS OF THE LAST COUPLE OF

23:30.200 --> 23:32.300
DAYS HAVE THE KIND OF

23:32.366 --> 23:34.400
RAMIFICATIONS FOR JOE BIDEN THAT

23:34.466 --> 23:36.400
WOULD PULL DOWN OTHER DEMOCRATS

23:36.466 --> 23:37.133
IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

23:37.200 --> 23:40.366
UP UNTIL THAT MOMENT, ALL OF THE

23:40.433 --> 23:41.466
POLLING SUGGESTED THAT THE

23:41.533 --> 23:43.200
AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE WITH THE

23:43.266 --> 23:43.766
PRINCIPLE OF WITHDRAWING AND

23:43.833 --> 23:45.400
ACCEPTED THE IDEA IT WAS GOING

23:45.466 --> 23:48.566
TO BE MESSY, YOU'VE NOT HAVE

23:48.633 --> 23:49.700
AMERICAN SOLDIERS GIVING THEIR

23:49.766 --> 23:50.533
LIVES AND THE QUESTION IS DO

23:50.600 --> 23:52.400
AMERICANS AFTER 20 YEARS FEEL WE

23:52.466 --> 23:55.100
WERE SO DESPERATE TO GET OUT AND

23:55.166 --> 23:56.833
WE REALIZE IT WAS GOING TO BE

23:56.900 --> 23:58.800
COMPLICATED, I THINK THERE'S A

23:58.866 --> 23:59.666
LOT MORE SYMPATHY AND THE

23:59.733 --> 24:01.300
AMERICAN PUBLIC FOR THE

24:01.366 --> 24:03.333
COMPLEXITIES OF THIS MISSION AND

24:03.400 --> 24:05.433
GETTING PEOPLE OUT.

24:05.500 --> 24:06.333
IN A YEAR'S TIME, THE AWFULNESS

24:06.400 --> 24:10.100
OF THE LAST FEW DAYS THEY ARE

24:10.166 --> 24:10.700
PREPARED TO TOLERATE BECAUSE

24:10.766 --> 24:13.100
THEY WANTED TO GET OUT HERE >>

24:13.166 --> 24:17.233
THE TRUTH IS 14 MONTHS IS AN

24:17.300 --> 24:18.400
ETERNITY IN POLITICS, THAT'S HOW

24:18.466 --> 24:20.200
FAR WE ARE FROM THE MIDTERMS BUT

24:20.266 --> 24:23.133
IF PAST IS PROLOGUE, WHEN YOU

24:23.200 --> 24:25.200
HAVE A NATIONAL SECURITY FIASCO

24:25.266 --> 24:27.600
OF THIS MAGNITUDE, IT CAN BECOME

24:27.666 --> 24:32.366
DEFINING OF YOUR PRESIDENCY.

24:32.433 --> 24:34.033
>> Bill: BENGHAZI WAS FOUR

24:34.100 --> 24:35.933
PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT HILLARY'S

24:36.000 --> 24:38.566
FAULT THAT LIVED ON FOREVER.

24:38.633 --> 24:40.033
>> IT DID TO.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.633
>> Bill: THIS IS THEIR NEW

24:42.700 --> 24:44.666
BENGHAZI AND --

24:44.733 --> 24:46.233
>> AND IN FACT DURING THAT

24:46.300 --> 24:47.766
INVESTIGATION WE FOUND OUT THAT

24:47.833 --> 24:49.233
SHE HAD A HOMEBREWED SERVER WITH

24:49.300 --> 24:52.466
CLASSIFIED EMAILS ON IT, HAUNTED

24:54.300 --> 24:56.600

24:57.166 --> 25:00.100

25:00.166 --> 25:01.700
JUSTIFIABLY THERE >> WHETHER IT

25:01.766 --> 25:03.433
WOULD JUSTIFIABLE OR NOT, IT DID

25:03.500 --> 25:05.466
STICK TO HER AND THERE ARE GOING

25:05.533 --> 25:06.833
TO BE INVESTIGATIONS, SUBPOENAS,

25:06.900 --> 25:08.266
THERE'S GOING TO BE TESTIMONY.

25:08.333 --> 25:12.833
IT'S GOING TO BE UGLY.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.033
>> Bill: WHY DO WE HAVE TO

25:14.100 --> 25:16.900
MAKE IT UGLY -- WE CAN'T HELP

25:16.966 --> 25:19.833
BEING FRIENDS, YOU KEEP DOING

25:19.900 --> 25:21.533
THIS SHOW I KEEP HAVING YOU ON.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.633
EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SO LITTLE IN

25:22.700 --> 25:25.166
COMMON.

25:25.233 --> 25:25.433
[LAUGHTER]

25:25.500 --> 25:27.800
AMERICA HAS TO GET BACK TO THIS.

25:27.866 --> 25:28.766

25:28.833 --> 25:30.333
>> Bill: THIS IS MY QUESTION,

25:30.400 --> 25:31.366
I SEE DEPRESSING THINGS ON THE

25:31.433 --> 25:34.333
NEWS ALL THE TIME WITH -- HARD

25:34.400 --> 25:35.566
TO WATCH.

25:35.633 --> 25:37.666
MOBS OF PEOPLE SURROUNDING A CAR

25:37.733 --> 25:39.633
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE THE MASK

25:39.700 --> 25:41.500
POLICY OF THE SCHOOL BOARD

25:41.566 --> 25:44.033
MEMBER, OR THE HEALTH OFFICIAL

25:44.100 --> 25:46.433
AND "WE KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE."

25:46.500 --> 25:49.133
AND THIS HAPPENS ON THE LEFT

25:49.200 --> 25:50.800
TOO, ESPECIALLY ONLINE.

25:50.866 --> 25:52.200
MORE THAN ONE CELEBRITY HAS

25:52.266 --> 25:54.366
GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE FOR LIKE

25:54.433 --> 25:55.766
"YOU SHOULD DIE."

25:55.833 --> 25:56.966
WHO TALKS LIKE THIS?

25:57.033 --> 25:58.766
WHO THINKS LIKE THIS, YOU SHOULD

25:58.833 --> 26:00.700
DIE, WE KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE?

26:00.766 --> 26:02.400
HOW DO WE GET BACK TO "I DON'T

26:02.466 --> 26:06.166
GET YOU."

26:06.233 --> 26:06.800
WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT GOING OUT

26:06.866 --> 26:11.133
TO THE TITTY BAR TOGETHER.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.500
>> NO WE ARE NOT.

26:13.566 --> 26:14.100
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

26:14.166 --> 26:17.466
AND YET YOU'RE AN AMERICAN, I'M

26:17.533 --> 26:18.533
AN AMERICAN, WE DON'T HAVE TO

26:18.600 --> 26:19.966
HATE EACH OTHER, HOW DO WE GET

26:20.033 --> 26:20.633
BACK THERE?

26:20.700 --> 26:22.600
THE ROAD WE ARE ON NOW IS NOT

26:22.666 --> 26:24.033
GOING THAT DIRECTION, THERE IS

26:24.100 --> 26:26.633
NO AMERICAN TRAGEDY, IT'S ALWAYS

26:26.700 --> 26:28.233
JUST A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN

26:28.300 --> 26:28.466
TRAGEDY.

26:28.533 --> 26:30.533
>> HOW ABOUT YOU WERE THERE WHEN

26:30.600 --> 26:32.533
YOU HAD SOMEBODY ELSE TO HATE

26:32.600 --> 26:33.633
AND THE WHOLE PERIOD OF THE

26:33.700 --> 26:35.800
COLD WAR IT WAS GOING TO BE

26:35.866 --> 26:37.566
EASIER TO BE FRIENDLY WITH

26:37.633 --> 26:38.533
PEOPLE YOU DISAGREED WITH

26:38.600 --> 26:39.966
BECAUSE THERE WAS AN OUTSIDE

26:40.033 --> 26:41.133
ENEMY AND THE OUTSIDE ENEMY WANT

26:41.200 --> 26:43.400
TO WEIGH IN FOR A VERY BRIEF

26:43.466 --> 26:44.400
PERIOD AFTER 9/11, EVERYONE

26:44.466 --> 26:46.800
LOVED EACH OTHER AGAIN, THAT

26:46.866 --> 26:47.900
DIDN'T LAST LONG.

26:47.966 --> 26:49.000
WITHOUT THAT OUTSIDE ENEMY,

26:49.066 --> 26:50.833
THERE WAS THIS WEIRD URGE TO

26:50.900 --> 26:52.333
HATE SOMEBODY BECAUSE IF YOU

26:52.400 --> 26:55.100
LOOK AT THE POLICIES EVEN ON

26:55.166 --> 26:55.666
CONTROVERSIAL POLICIES LIKE

26:55.733 --> 26:59.366
ABORTION AND GUN RIGHTS AND

26:59.433 --> 27:01.066
IMMIGRATION, PEOPLE AREN'T THAT

27:01.133 --> 27:02.166
FAR APART ON THE LEFT AND THE

27:02.233 --> 27:04.800
RIGHT, IN MANY CASES THERE ARE

27:04.866 --> 27:05.100
MAJORITIES.

27:05.166 --> 27:07.100
>> Bill: THAT'S NOT A POLICY,

27:07.166 --> 27:07.433
ITS CULTURAL.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.900
>> TAKE THE EMOTION OUT OF IT,

27:10.966 --> 27:13.533
THERE ARE BUSINESS LEADERS WHO

27:13.600 --> 27:15.000
SUPPORT MORE IMMIGRATION AND

27:15.066 --> 27:15.866
UNION PEOPLE WHO DON'T SUPPORT

27:15.933 --> 27:19.500
IMMIGRATION AND IT'S NOT A

27:19.566 --> 27:21.600
LEFT-RIGHT ISSUE, IT'S ALL ABOUT

27:21.666 --> 27:26.166
THE EMOTION.

27:26.233 --> 27:29.233
>> I THINK YOU'RE DEFINITELY ON

27:29.300 --> 27:30.633
TO SOMETHING, THAT EXTERNAL

27:30.700 --> 27:33.133
ADVERSARY DRIVES US CLOSER

27:33.200 --> 27:33.633
TOGETHER.

27:33.700 --> 27:34.800
WE CERTAINLY FELT THAT FOR NOT

27:34.866 --> 27:36.566
AS LONG AS WE WOULD HAVE LIKED

27:36.633 --> 27:38.533
AFTER SEPTEMBER 11TH BUT THERE

27:38.600 --> 27:39.600
WAS A PERIOD OF NATIONAL UNITY

27:39.666 --> 27:46.933
AND COMING TOGETHER.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.166
I THINK SOCIAL MEDIA TENDS TO

27:49.233 --> 27:55.433
EXACERBATE, I THINK WE NEED TO

27:55.500 --> 27:56.800
MOVE AWAY -- I'M NOT SAYING GET

27:56.866 --> 28:00.066
OFF THOSE FORUMS BUT I THINK WE

28:00.133 --> 28:01.433
NEED TO FIND FORUMS OUTSIDE OF

28:01.500 --> 28:03.700
SOCIAL MEDIA WE CAN HAVE A

28:03.766 --> 28:06.000
CONSTRUCTIVE.

28:06.066 --> 28:07.100
>> Bill: STOP TALKING

28:07.166 --> 28:08.666
POLITICS, PEOPLE DIDN'T USE TO

28:08.733 --> 28:10.200
TALK POLITICS ALL THE TIME, I

28:10.266 --> 28:12.966
THINK THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

28:13.033 --> 28:14.033
WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH WE

28:14.100 --> 28:16.466
HATED THE OTHER GUY AND IT

28:16.533 --> 28:20.200
WORKED A LOT BETTER.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.166
IT WASN'T ON FACEBOOK.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.000
>> IF YOU WERE JUST TALKING

28:23.066 --> 28:23.600
POLITICS AND TALKING POLICY I

28:23.666 --> 28:26.166
DON'T THINK WE WOULD HATE EACH

28:26.233 --> 28:27.566
OTHER.

28:27.633 --> 28:29.666
I THINK IT'S THE TRIBE, I'M IN A

28:29.733 --> 28:30.966
TRIBE AND NOTHING YOU SAY I'M

28:31.033 --> 28:31.866
EVER GOING TO ACCEPT BECAUSE

28:31.933 --> 28:33.800
YOU'RE NOT IN MY TRIBE, SO I

28:33.866 --> 28:35.333
HAVE TO HATE YOU EVEN IF I KIND

28:35.400 --> 28:36.333
OF AGREE WITH YOU.

28:36.400 --> 28:42.166
I STILL HAVE TO HATE YOU.

28:42.233 --> 28:43.166
>> Bill: DID YOU SEE THE NEW

28:43.233 --> 28:46.766
BORAT MOVIE, THE SEQUEL?

28:46.833 --> 28:49.500
>> I MISSED THAT ONE.

28:49.566 --> 28:50.700
[LAUGHTER]

28:50.766 --> 28:52.166
>> Bill: THERE'S TWO GUYS AND

28:52.233 --> 28:54.766
IT'S THAT HE LIVES WITH FOR A

28:54.833 --> 28:55.466
WEEK, THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THE

28:55.533 --> 28:57.000
FIRST BORAT.

28:57.066 --> 28:58.266
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS IN

28:58.333 --> 29:00.500
CHARACTER, HE WAS SO GREAT AT

29:00.566 --> 29:02.566
THAT.

29:02.633 --> 29:03.200
YOU MIGHT CALL REDNECKS, THEY

29:03.266 --> 29:06.900
WEREN'T BAD PEOPLE, I'M WATCHING

29:06.966 --> 29:08.766
THESE GUYS AND OUTSIDE OF

29:08.833 --> 29:10.466
POLITICS I COULD TALK TO THEM, I

29:10.533 --> 29:11.966
COULD GO TO A BASEBALL GAME WITH

29:12.033 --> 29:13.366
THEM, THEY ARE NOT STUPID,

29:13.433 --> 29:15.000
THEY'RE NOT CRAZY, THEY'RE USING

29:15.066 --> 29:17.500
COMPUTERS.

29:17.566 --> 29:19.366
[LAUGHTER]

29:19.433 --> 29:21.000
BUT THEY BELIEVE IN EVERY CUE IN

29:21.066 --> 29:22.533
ON CRAZY THING THERE IS THAT SHE

29:22.600 --> 29:24.933
DON'T THINK THE DEMOCRATS EAT

29:25.000 --> 29:25.400
BABIES, DO YOU?

29:25.466 --> 29:27.133
>> NO.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.566

29:29.633 --> 29:31.666
BUT THEY DO AND QANON DOES.

29:31.733 --> 29:35.833
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, YOU TAKE

29:35.900 --> 29:36.866
AWAY THE POLITICS, THESE ARE

29:36.933 --> 29:37.200
REGULAR GUYS.

29:37.266 --> 29:40.633
HOW DO WE GET INTO THEIR HEAD SO

29:40.700 --> 29:42.600
WE CAN GET THEM OUT OF THE IDEA

29:42.666 --> 29:44.033
THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE EATING

29:44.100 --> 29:44.266
BABIES?

29:44.333 --> 29:46.000
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS, I WOULD

29:46.066 --> 29:47.600

29:49.133 --> 29:51.300
YOU'RE WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

29:51.366 --> 29:54.533
THE FIRST IS, I JUST FINISHED

30:00.000 --> 30:00.366
HAMILTON BOOK.

30:00.433 --> 30:00.933
IT'S AMAZING, IT'S EASY TO

30:01.000 --> 30:04.633
FORGET HOW MUCH THEY FOUGHT.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.000
IT'S EASY TO FORGET HOW PITCHED

30:06.066 --> 30:09.200
THE BATTLES WERE AND OUR OWN

30:09.266 --> 30:09.433

30:26.133 --> 30:28.766
A BRITISH AGENT, SOUND FAMILIAR?

30:28.833 --> 30:30.033
A PRESIDENT ACCUSED OF BEING AN

30:30.100 --> 30:32.533
AGENT OF A FOREIGN POWER?

30:32.600 --> 30:33.300
THAT WENT ON THEN.

30:34.633 --> 30:35.800
ON THE SIDE OF THE BRITISH FOR

30:35.866 --> 30:37.566
THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.

30:37.633 --> 30:39.233

33:01.333 --> 33:01.533
[LAUGHTER]

33:01.600 --> 33:05.533
I DREAM OF GERRYMANDERING.

33:05.600 --> 33:05.800
[LAUGHTER]

33:05.866 --> 33:08.966
CURB YOUR ENVIRONMENTALISM.

33:09.033 --> 33:09.233
[LAUGHTER]

33:09.300 --> 33:11.366
[APPLAUSE]

33:11.433 --> 33:17.933
THIS IS GUS.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.566
[LAUGHTER]

33:20.633 --> 33:22.766
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

33:22.833 --> 33:24.566
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS PART.

33:24.633 --> 33:26.733
I HAVE BEEN ASKED OVER THE YEARS

33:26.800 --> 33:28.933
MANY TIMES WHY ISN'T THERE

33:29.000 --> 33:29.366
CONSERVATIVE COMEDY.

33:29.433 --> 33:31.233
AND I ALWAYS WOULD GIVE THE

33:31.300 --> 33:31.800
ANSWER WHICH I THINK WAS THE

33:31.866 --> 33:33.766
TRUE ANSWER, IS NOT GOOD FODDER

33:33.833 --> 33:36.366
FOR IT.

33:36.433 --> 33:38.433
THE LIBERALS AREN'T CRAZY, THIS

33:38.500 --> 33:41.566
WAS MY ANSWER FOR MANY YEARS.

33:41.633 --> 33:42.966
I CITED DENNIS MILLER WHO IS A

33:43.033 --> 33:46.200
GREAT COMEDIAN, PERIOD.

33:46.266 --> 33:47.300
WHEN HE BECAME A CONSERVATIVE,

33:47.366 --> 33:51.300
HE WAS TASKED WITH DOING

33:51.366 --> 33:52.266
10 MINUTES ON NANCY PELOSI, AND

33:52.333 --> 33:53.366
THE SAME WAY WE WOULD TALK ABOUT

33:53.433 --> 33:55.900
SARAH PALIN.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.033
IF NANCY PELOSI ISN'T FUNNY LIKE

33:58.100 --> 34:00.066
THAT BECAUSE SHE'S NOT CRAZY OR

34:00.133 --> 34:02.533
STUPID, SARAH PALIN IS A MORON.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.933
[LAUGHTER]

34:05.000 --> 34:05.400
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

34:05.466 --> 34:07.566
IT'S EASY TO MAKE FUN OF HER,

34:07.633 --> 34:13.900
IT'S EASY TO MAKE FUN OF METH

34:13.966 --> 34:15.300
LAB SARAH PALIN -- I'M NOT

34:15.366 --> 34:17.066
SAYING SHE WORKS IN A METH LAB

34:17.133 --> 34:17.666
BUT I KNOW WE DID SOME JOKES

34:17.733 --> 34:21.966
ABOUT THAT.

34:22.033 --> 34:23.000
THERE WAS NOTHING TO MAKE FUN

34:23.066 --> 34:26.133
OF, IT WAS THAT CRAZY.

34:26.200 --> 34:28.100
NOW, I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SAME

34:28.166 --> 34:28.366
SITUATION.

34:28.433 --> 34:31.133
I KEEP SAYING TO THE LIBERALS,

34:31.200 --> 34:32.200
YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:32.266 --> 34:33.166
IF WHAT YOU'RE DOING SOUNDS LIKE

34:33.233 --> 34:38.966
AN ONION HEADLINE, STOP.

34:39.033 --> 34:42.566
[LAUGHTER]

34:42.633 --> 34:44.400
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

34:44.466 --> 34:47.333
THIS IS WHY THERE IS AN OPENING

34:47.400 --> 34:49.100
FOR CONSERVATIVE COMEDY, BECAUSE

34:49.166 --> 34:51.066
WHEN YOU TEAR DOWN STATUES OF

34:51.133 --> 34:53.900
ABRAHAM LINCOLN IN THE LAND OF

34:53.966 --> 34:55.000
LINCOLN, THE LAND OF LINCOLN

34:55.066 --> 34:57.300
CANCELS LINCOLN -- IT'S AN ONION

34:57.366 --> 34:58.300
HEADLINE.

34:58.366 --> 34:59.700
3-YEAR-OLDS PICK THEIR OWN

34:59.766 --> 35:02.533
GENDER IS AN ONION HEADLINE.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.033
A LOT OF THIS STUFF THAT GOES ON

35:04.100 --> 35:06.933
ON THE LEFT NOW -- SEATTLE VOTES

35:07.000 --> 35:15.133
TO DECRIMINALIZE CRIME.

35:15.200 --> 35:15.900
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T

35:15.966 --> 35:18.233
KNOW HOW TO DO COMEDY.

35:18.300 --> 35:19.066
BUT IF THEY FOUND SOMEONE WHO

35:19.133 --> 35:21.266
DID THEY COULD, BECAUSE I DO IT

35:21.333 --> 35:23.366
MORE HERE THAN I USED TO BECAUSE

35:23.433 --> 35:25.300
COMEDY GOES WITH THE FUNNY IS

35:25.366 --> 35:26.700
AND THERE IS FUNNY ON THE LEFT

35:26.766 --> 35:29.433
NOW AS WELL AS THE RIGHT.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.733
[APPLAUSE]

35:32.800 --> 35:34.600
>> YOU DON'T AGREE?

35:34.666 --> 35:37.700
>> DID YOU GO TOO MANY TRUMP

35:37.766 --> 35:39.033
RALLIES?

35:39.100 --> 35:40.066
>> Bill: I WAS MADE FUN OF IN

35:40.133 --> 35:42.633
MANY TRUMP RALLIES -- WHY WOULD

35:42.700 --> 35:44.500
I GO TO A TRUMP RALLY, I WOULD

35:44.566 --> 35:45.033
GET PUNCHED.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.566
>> I WOULD GO TO A BUNCH OF

35:46.633 --> 35:47.466
TRUMP RALLIES, IT WAS SORT OF A

35:47.533 --> 35:53.000
SHOW.

35:53.066 --> 35:54.266
IT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING AS A

35:54.333 --> 35:58.966
TRUMP RALLY, IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN

35:59.033 --> 36:00.300
MORE SUCCINCTLY, TRUMP GOES ON A

36:00.366 --> 36:01.700
NONCOME AFTER TWO HOURS HE'S

36:01.766 --> 36:03.133
STILL GOING BUT IT WAS SORT OF A

36:03.200 --> 36:05.833
FUNNY SHOW AND THE LINES THAT

36:05.900 --> 36:07.300
TRUMP USED TO TALK ABOUT AND

36:07.366 --> 36:10.033
MAKE FUN OF, LIBERALS, IS

36:10.100 --> 36:17.200
EXACTLY WHAT G -- HE'S JUST STON

36:17.266 --> 36:17.533
TRUMPS LINES.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.166
>> WHEN COMEDY BECOMES TOTALLY

36:19.233 --> 36:20.666
PREDICTABLE IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY

36:20.733 --> 36:22.533
AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE

36:22.600 --> 36:23.433
TRADITIONAL LEGACY BROADCAST

36:23.500 --> 36:27.500
MEDIA SHOWS IS THERE DEMOCRATIC

36:27.566 --> 36:28.633
TALKING POINTS.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.366
>> Bill: I AGREE.

36:30.433 --> 36:32.100
>> HALF OF COMEDY IS YOU SAY

36:32.166 --> 36:34.300
SOMETHING I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO

36:34.366 --> 36:35.500
SAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER

36:35.566 --> 36:37.133
IT'S LEFT, RIGHT, OR CENTER.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.533
I THINK IN ADDITION TO THAT AND

36:39.600 --> 36:41.766
YOU KNOW THIS, THE CAMERA IS A

36:41.833 --> 36:42.266
VERY PENETRATING MEDIUM.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.733
THERE'S NOWHERE TO HIDE.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.000
YOU'VE EITHER GOT THE TALENT OR

36:46.066 --> 36:48.766
YOU DON'T AND I KNOW GREG, HE'S

36:48.833 --> 36:51.833
FUNNY, HE'S SMART, HE'S QUICK

36:51.900 --> 36:52.866
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU PUT

36:52.933 --> 36:54.833
HIM WITH AN ENSEMBLE WHERE HE

36:54.900 --> 36:58.633
GETS THE PLAY OFF OTHER PEOPLE,

36:58.700 --> 36:59.100
IT WORKS.

36:59.166 --> 37:01.866
>> I'VE WATCHED IT, IT'S PRETTY

37:01.933 --> 37:02.966
PREDICTABLE.

37:03.033 --> 37:05.933
YOU CAN TELL WHAT HE IS GOING TO

37:06.000 --> 37:06.100
SAY.

37:06.166 --> 37:08.733
>> IT'S NOT AS PREDICTABLE AS

37:08.800 --> 37:09.866
COLBERT.

37:09.933 --> 37:12.833
>> IT'S PREDICTABLE, YOU KNOW

37:12.900 --> 37:14.266
WHAT HE'S GOING TO SAY ABOUT

37:14.333 --> 37:15.800
CLIMATE, YOU KNOW IT IS GOING TO

37:15.866 --> 37:16.200
SAY ABOUT WOMEN.

37:16.266 --> 37:17.433
>> Bill: I COULD SAY THE SAME

37:17.500 --> 37:18.833
THING ABOUT THE OTHER SHOWS COME

37:18.900 --> 37:19.166
ABSOLUTELY.

37:19.233 --> 37:20.800
IT IS THE ONE TRUE OPINION OUT

37:20.866 --> 37:22.966
THERE -- IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE

37:23.033 --> 37:25.200
ONE TRUE OPINION, DON'T GO IN

37:25.266 --> 37:26.166
FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE IT COMES

37:26.233 --> 37:28.000
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE IT AND

37:28.066 --> 37:29.300
THEY ARE THERE MORE TO CLAP FOR

37:29.366 --> 37:30.900
THE OPINION THEY ALREADY BELIEVE

37:30.966 --> 37:31.600
IN THAN THEY ARE TO LAUGH AND

37:31.666 --> 37:33.733
THAT'S WHAT CHANGED.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.333
>> BACK TO YOUR EARLIER

37:35.400 --> 37:37.066
QUESTION, WHEN DID EVERYTHING

37:37.133 --> 37:39.166
BECOME ABOUT POLITICS?

37:39.233 --> 37:40.900
WINDED COMEDY BECOME ABOUT

37:40.966 --> 37:41.333
POLITICS?

37:41.400 --> 37:42.133
>> Bill: THERE'S ALWAYS

37:42.200 --> 37:42.366
BEEN --

37:42.433 --> 37:44.100
>> THAT WASN'T THE WAY CARSON

37:44.166 --> 37:45.500
WAS OR LENO WAS HER EARLY

37:45.566 --> 37:46.466
LETTERMAN, IT WASN'T THE WAY

37:46.533 --> 37:48.733
JACK PARR WAS.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.566
>> Bill: THEY CERTAINLY DID

37:50.633 --> 37:52.333
POLITICS IN THE MONOLOGUE BUT

37:52.400 --> 37:53.000
THEY DID A MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD,

37:53.066 --> 37:54.733
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHO JOHNNY VOTED

37:54.800 --> 37:56.600
FOR.

37:56.666 --> 37:57.800
>> THEY WERE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

37:57.866 --> 37:59.166
TORMENTORS.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.300
THEY DINGED BOTH SIDES.

38:00.366 --> 38:04.133
WHAT I'M SAYING IS WHEN DID

38:04.200 --> 38:05.033
COMEDY BECOME REDUCTIONIST?

38:05.100 --> 38:06.400
>> Bill: WHEN EVERYTHING

38:06.466 --> 38:07.500
BECAME PARTISAN, IT BECAME MORE

38:07.566 --> 38:09.366
IMPORTANT TO CHEER FOR YOUR TEAM

38:09.433 --> 38:10.166
THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A LAUGH.

38:10.233 --> 38:12.633
>> WHICH IS WHERE YOU STARTED

38:12.700 --> 38:14.366
WITH PARTISANSHIP, THINGS ARE SO

38:14.433 --> 38:15.333
PARTISAN AND YOU CAN NEVER

38:15.400 --> 38:16.333
CRITICIZE YOUR OWN TRIBE, WE

38:16.400 --> 38:17.300
HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN DURING THE

38:17.366 --> 38:21.466
COURSE OF THIS WEEK WHERE

38:21.533 --> 38:22.100
REPORTERS HAVE BEEN SLAMMED BY

38:22.166 --> 38:24.933
THE ADMINISTRATION, BY SOME

38:25.000 --> 38:27.333
DEMOCRATS FOR POINTING OUT THAT

38:27.400 --> 38:28.633
THE WITHDRAWAL FROM AFGHANISTAN

38:28.700 --> 38:30.300
WAS A MASSIVE DISPLAY OF

38:30.366 --> 38:31.600
INCOMPETENCE WHICH IT WAS.

38:31.666 --> 38:33.000
WHEN PEOPLE ARE CLINGING TO THE

38:33.066 --> 38:34.766
WHEELS OF THE PLANE, THAT'S

38:34.833 --> 38:35.466
INCOMPETENT, THAT SHOULDN'T BE

38:35.533 --> 38:36.366
HAPPENING.

38:36.433 --> 38:37.000
IT'S ALMOST MORE VICIOUS WITHIN

38:37.066 --> 38:41.266
YOUR OWN TRIBE.

38:41.333 --> 38:42.500
>> Bill: WE'VE REPLACED

38:42.566 --> 38:43.400
EVERYTHING WITH POLITICS, YOU

38:43.466 --> 38:45.966
KNOW WHAT ELSE WE REPLACE WITH

38:46.033 --> 38:46.433
POLITICS?

38:46.500 --> 38:46.966
RELIGION.

38:47.033 --> 38:47.666
RELIGION IS WAY DOWN, I HATE TO

38:47.733 --> 38:49.933
TELL YOU.

38:50.000 --> 38:50.900
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE POLITICS IS

38:50.966 --> 38:54.300
THE NEW RELIGION.

38:54.366 --> 38:54.900
EATING BABIES, THERE'S NOTHING

38:54.966 --> 39:01.233
MORE RELIGIOUS THAN THAT.

39:01.300 --> 39:01.933
[LAUGHTER]

39:02.000 --> 39:02.800
U.S. CHURCH MEMBERSHIP, THE

39:02.866 --> 39:04.200
GALLUP POLL, THEY HAVE BEEN

39:04.266 --> 39:05.433
DOING THIS FOR 80 YEARS, PULLING

39:05.500 --> 39:08.333
PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR RELIGION.

39:08.400 --> 39:13.333
IN 1937, 73% WENT TO CHURCH, IN

39:13.400 --> 39:19.666
1999 IT WAS STILL 70%, 2010, 62.

39:19.733 --> 39:19.933
2018, 50.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.800
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IT HAS

39:21.866 --> 39:23.800
DROPPED BELOW 50%.

39:23.866 --> 39:26.666
[APPLAUSE]

39:26.733 --> 39:30.533
PLEASE, BE NICE.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.933
[LAUGHTER]

39:32.000 --> 39:34.833
YES, I TAKE A LOT OF THE CREDIT

39:34.900 --> 39:35.066
CREDITS.

39:35.133 --> 39:37.766
[APPLAUSE]

39:37.833 --> 39:40.733
IT WAS 47%, DEMOCRATS SHOWED A

39:40.800 --> 39:42.466
25-POINT DECLINE SINCE 2,000,

39:42.533 --> 39:44.200
EVEN REPUBLICANS A 12-POINT

39:44.266 --> 39:46.000
DROP, CATHOLICS LOST THE MOST

39:46.066 --> 39:48.533
AUDIENCE SHARE, SHALL WE SAY

39:48.600 --> 39:50.733
GOOD 18 POINTS, EVEN PROTESTANTS

39:50.800 --> 39:52.866
ARE DOWN NINE POINTS, JESUS IS

39:52.933 --> 39:57.733
HAVING TROUBLE PUTTING ASSES IN

39:57.800 --> 39:59.700
PEWS, WHY DO YOU THINK, WHY IS

39:59.766 --> 40:01.000
IT DROPPING SO MUCH?

40:01.066 --> 40:03.566
>> I THINK IT'S PART AND PARCEL,

40:03.633 --> 40:07.533
A SINKING TIDE LOWERS ALL

40:07.600 --> 40:07.766
BOATS --

40:07.833 --> 40:08.166
>> Bill: MEANING?

40:08.233 --> 40:10.700
>> THERE'S A GENERAL LACK OF

40:10.766 --> 40:12.400
TRUST AND AFFILIATION WITH ALL

40:12.466 --> 40:13.033
ORGANIZED INSTITUTIONS WHETHER

40:13.100 --> 40:15.733
IT'S BUSINESS OR THE MEDIA,

40:15.800 --> 40:18.333
ALMOST EVERY INSTITUTION --

40:18.400 --> 40:19.233
>> Bill: DOESN'T RELIGION SET

40:19.300 --> 40:22.333
ITSELF UP AS A INSTITUTION ABOVE

40:22.400 --> 40:23.200
ALL THAT?

40:23.266 --> 40:24.266
>> ORGANIZED RELIGION HAS BEEN

40:24.333 --> 40:24.766
NO EXCEPTION.

40:24.833 --> 40:26.166
LET ME POINT OUT A COUPLE

40:26.233 --> 40:27.466
THINGS, THE HEADLINES ABOUT THAT

40:27.533 --> 40:28.566
ONE NUMBER BUT LET ME TELL YOU

40:28.633 --> 40:29.866
WHAT ELSE THE POLL SHOWS.

40:29.933 --> 40:32.166
IT SHOWED THAT 83% OF AMERICAN

40:32.233 --> 40:35.666
PEOPLE STILL SAY THEY BELIEVE IN

40:35.733 --> 40:37.200
GOD, 59% OF THE PEOPLE SAY THEY

40:37.266 --> 40:39.766
PRAY TO GOD REGULARLY IN THEIR

40:39.833 --> 40:41.900
DAILY LIVES WHICH IS 9% HIGHER

40:41.966 --> 40:44.433
THAN IT WAS IN 1990 AND DO YOU

40:44.500 --> 40:45.800
KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER ONE REASON

40:45.866 --> 40:46.800
PEOPLE GAVE IN THAT POLL FOR WHY

40:46.866 --> 40:50.833
THEN THERE WERE NO LONGER

40:50.900 --> 40:52.133
ATTENDING RELIGIOUS SERVICES?

40:52.200 --> 40:52.833
THE NUMBER ONE REASON WAS

40:52.900 --> 41:00.700
BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO PRAY AND

41:00.766 --> 41:01.333
WORSHIP GOD IN THE PRIVACY OF

41:01.400 --> 41:01.700
THEIR OWN HOME.

41:01.766 --> 41:02.333
THEY ARE TURNING AWAY FROM GOD,

41:02.400 --> 41:02.900
THEY ARE TURNING AWAY FROM

41:02.966 --> 41:03.500
JESUS, THEY ARE TURNING AWAY

41:03.566 --> 41:03.966
FROM THE INSTITUTION.

41:04.033 --> 41:04.533
IF I BELIEVE THEY WILL COME

41:04.600 --> 41:04.733
BACK.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.533
IT'S CYCLICAL.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.266
>> THE SAME POLLING ALSO SHOWS

41:09.333 --> 41:10.833
THAT TRUST IN RELIGIOUS LEADERS

41:10.900 --> 41:13.766
HAS FALLEN TO AN ALL-TIME LOW OF

41:13.833 --> 41:13.933
37%.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.400
YOU ARE LESS TRUSTED THAN

41:18.466 --> 41:20.366
DOCTORS, TEACHERS, EVEN THE

41:20.433 --> 41:21.033
POLICE, YOU ARE MORE TRUSTED

41:21.100 --> 41:23.266
THAN JOURNALISTS, I GIVE YOU

41:23.333 --> 41:24.933
THAT.

41:25.000 --> 41:25.933
[LAUGHTER]

41:26.000 --> 41:27.866
>> IT'S HARD TO GET LOWER THAN

41:27.933 --> 41:28.166
THE MEDIA.

41:28.233 --> 41:32.333
>> I WILL GRANT YOU.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.300
WE HAD A SLEW OF CATHOLIC

41:34.366 --> 41:35.733
SEX SCANDALS AND THEN I THINK

41:35.800 --> 41:39.133
YOU HAD THE FAKE EVANGELICAL

41:39.200 --> 41:40.100
CHURCHES PUTTING THEIR WEIGHT

41:40.166 --> 41:41.100
BEHIND A GUY WHO WAS NOT THE

41:41.166 --> 41:43.433
MOST RELIGIOUS OF PRESIDENTS AND

41:43.500 --> 41:46.600
YOU WONDER WHY IT HAS BEEN A

41:46.666 --> 41:48.233
DECLINE OF TRUST AND RELIGIOUS

41:48.300 --> 41:48.466
LEADERS.

41:48.533 --> 41:53.400
[APPLAUSE]

41:53.466 --> 41:54.466
>> I KNOW THAT'S YOUR OPINION

41:54.533 --> 41:55.366
AND YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO

41:55.433 --> 41:56.766
HOLDS IT.

41:56.833 --> 41:58.133
ALL I'M SAYING IS, THAT'S NOT

41:58.200 --> 42:00.700
SUPPORTED BY THE DATA.

42:00.766 --> 42:02.100
WHEN PEOPLE WERE ASKED WHY THEY

42:02.166 --> 42:03.733
HAVE LOST FAITH OR WHY THEY

42:03.800 --> 42:05.333
WEREN'T ATTENDING CHURCH OR WHY

42:05.400 --> 42:07.133
THEY WANT MEMBERS, THEY DIDN'T

42:07.200 --> 42:08.866
SAY POLITICS, THEY SAID I PREFER

42:08.933 --> 42:11.166
TO WORSHIP ON MY OWN BUT THERE'S

42:11.233 --> 42:13.133
NO QUESTION THAT SOME OF THESE

42:13.200 --> 42:15.633
SCANDALS AND SOME OF THESE

42:15.700 --> 42:16.300
DOWNFALLS HAVE AFFECTED THE WAY

42:16.366 --> 42:19.200
THE CHURCH IS VIEWED.

42:19.266 --> 42:20.533
REMEMBER, THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE

42:20.600 --> 42:23.166
HERE ISN'T TO GET THEM TO HAVE

42:23.233 --> 42:25.233
FAITH IN AN INSTITUTION OR IN A

42:25.300 --> 42:26.533
LEADER, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO LEAD

42:26.600 --> 42:30.133
THEM TO GOD THROUGH HIS SON

42:30.200 --> 42:31.766
JESUS CHRIST.

42:31.833 --> 42:32.833
[APPLAUSE]

42:32.900 --> 42:33.533
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT

42:33.600 --> 42:34.300
SPIRITUAL HUNGER IS AN AGE TO

42:34.366 --> 42:37.200
THE HUMAN SPIRIT THAT EVERY

42:37.266 --> 42:40.600
PERSON HAS WHAT PASCAL CALLED

42:40.666 --> 42:41.766
"THE GOD-SHAPED VACUUM IN THERE

42:41.833 --> 42:44.533
SO THAT NOTHING ELSE CAN FILL."

42:44.600 --> 42:46.100
>> Bill: RALPH, IT'S NOT

42:46.166 --> 42:49.766

PEOPLE GOING TO CHURCH, YOUR

43:01.900 --> 43:02.933
POINT ABOUT RELIGION AND

43:03.000 --> 43:05.133
POLITICS BEING LINKED.

43:05.200 --> 43:06.933
PART OF THE REASON PEOPLE GO TO

43:07.000 --> 43:09.666
CHURCH IS A SENSE OF COMMUNITY

43:09.733 --> 43:11.133
AND TRIBE, YES THERE IS A

43:11.200 --> 43:12.966
SPIRITUAL SIDE BUT THERE IS ALSO

43:13.033 --> 43:14.933
THIS FERVOR AND FAITH WHICH IF

43:15.000 --> 43:16.166
YOU HAVE POLITICAL POLARIZATION

43:16.233 --> 43:17.733
AND POLITICS OR A POLITICAL

43:17.800 --> 43:20.400
GROUP BECOMES YOUR NEW CHURCH

43:20.466 --> 43:21.933
AND THROUGH FACEBOOK IN A WAY IT

43:22.000 --> 43:23.366
BECAME A NEW CHURCH, THAT WAS

43:23.433 --> 43:26.166
YOUR NEW ORGANIZED RELIGION.

43:26.233 --> 43:28.200

I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS THE

43:29.100 --> 43:30.500
WORLD THAT I SWIM IN, IT'S NOT

43:30.566 --> 43:32.933
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE

43:33.000 --> 43:34.333
CHURCHES.

43:34.400 --> 43:34.933
YOU GO TO THE EVANGELICAL

43:46.366 --> 43:49.266

43:49.333 --> 43:50.500

43:50.566 --> 43:54.533
PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL SWIMMING.

43:54.600 --> 43:55.633
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE

43:55.700 --> 43:57.000
WHO HAVE STOPPED SWIMMING.

43:57.066 --> 43:58.533
>> IF THEY LEFT THE CHURCH

43:58.600 --> 44:00.166
BECAUSE OF POLITICS, THERE'S NOT

44:00.233 --> 44:01.366
POLITICS GOING ON.

44:01.433 --> 44:03.866

44:03.933 --> 44:05.300
REPLACED THAT, IT'S STILL

44:05.366 --> 44:06.933
RELIGIOUS, POLITICS IS RELIGIOUS

44:42.000 --> 44:43.333
BY COVID, A LOT OF CHURCHES WERE

44:43.400 --> 44:43.566
CLOSED.

44:43.633 --> 44:45.466

44:45.533 --> 44:46.500
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS.

YEARS, THE ONLINE WORSHIP

44:54.900 --> 44:56.000
EXPERIENCE HAS SKYROCKETED.

45:29.633 --> 45:31.700
NIRVANA'S ICONIC NEVERMIND

45:33.466 --> 45:35.700
HE SAYS THAT COVER WAS "SEXUAL

45:35.766 --> 45:38.333
EXPLOITATION" THAT HURT HIM

45:38.400 --> 45:40.700
EMOTIONALLY FOR THE REST OF HIS

45:40.766 --> 45:42.333
LIFE, THAT IF SOMEONE CAN

PREMISE OF ANY HORROR MOVIE.

APPEARS AND KILLS YOU.
