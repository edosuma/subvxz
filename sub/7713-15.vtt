00:04.505 --> 00:06.255
I'm going around
to all the branches,

00:06.340 --> 00:09.258

my secret recipe
for success.

00:09.385 --> 00:12.095

You remember Holly?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.795
She used to work for HR.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.296
She was the love of my life.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.383
She just left and
l never got closure.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.970
And l feel like
l need to go to Nashua
and get closure.

l am proud to announce
that there is a new addition
to the Martin family.

$7,000.

l can get you
a kid for that.

Where did you get
that kind of money?

engagement ring
on eBay.

Yeah. l mean,
l usually try to take leave
when l get a new cat,

02:24.102 --> 02:25.686
but l'm out of
vacation days,

02:25.771 --> 02:28.356
and this
company still doesn't
recognize cat maternity.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.691
l mean, somebody has a kid,
oh, sure, take off a year.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.985
She's right.
l had my second kid
just for the vacation.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.404
Right. Anyways,
l just want to make sure

02:35.489 --> 02:37.615
Princess Lady is
acclimating well.

We're now adding Nashua
to the lecture circuit,

02:52.464 --> 02:55.758
so Michael can confront Holly
and get some closure.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.094
Nashua actually
sounded very excited
on the phone.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.972
l don't think they get
a lot of visitors.

03:01.056 --> 03:04.141

Hey, Dwight,

What did you do?

03:45.017 --> 03:47.977
My boyfriend dumped me,
so l stole his boat.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.938
He told me it was his boat.
lt was actually his father's.

be really romantic,

but with, like, a boat.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.070
