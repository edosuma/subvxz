00:05.283 --> 00:06.450
Eric...

00:06.769 --> 00:10.257
I found this in the garage
and I want an explanation.

00:10.283 --> 00:15.917
Okay, when people write stories and glue the
pages together, it forms what we call a book,

00:16.384 --> 00:21.834
I don't want "the joy of sex"
polluting my house.

00:23.059 --> 00:27.927
"The joy of sex."
What a load of crap.

00:28.777 --> 00:31.227
That book's
for perverts, red.

00:31.443 --> 00:34.643
You should give it to me
so I can sell it to fez.

00:35.347 --> 00:37.308
Red, the book is mine.

00:37.411 --> 00:41.159
I put it in the garage
so you would find it.

00:42.693 --> 00:45.093
Uh-oh. I'm late for work.

00:45.160 --> 00:51.010
No, no, no, I am serious. It's high time you
and i put some zip back in the bedroom.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.810
I got a great idea.

00:54.860 --> 00:58.680
We'll put a tv in the bedroom.
There's your zip.

01:03.071 --> 01:05.055
Okay, I want
the full fez treatment--

01:05.105 --> 01:09.205
a wash, cream rinse and a lot of that
wiggly stuff you do with your fingers.

01:09.255 --> 01:11.049
It's magical.

01:11.122 --> 01:13.538
Abracadabra, baby.

01:14.072 --> 01:19.038
So, danielle, what's on your schedule today?
I mean, besides looking beautiful.

01:19.355 --> 01:22.916
Well, looking beautiful is from
10 to 12, then I have a date.

01:22.966 --> 01:26.399
Ooh, hot date alert.
Tsss!

01:29.066 --> 01:31.533
It's not that hot. The guy's
kind of a knucklehead.

01:31.583 --> 01:35.116
I mean, he's really cute, but it's like,
when I talk, he's not paying attention to me.

01:35.166 --> 01:36.466
Oh!

01:38.363 --> 01:41.513
I hear this complaint
20 times a day.

01:42.113 --> 01:45.863
You're a treasure. He should
worship you like a big stone head.

01:46.746 --> 01:49.146
You're so great. You know,
you really get women.

01:49.196 --> 01:52.263
Well, if you mean "get" as in
"understand," then, yes, I get them.

01:52.296 --> 01:54.613
But if you mean "get"
as in "get,"

01:55.313 --> 01:56.946
then, no, never.

01:58.346 --> 02:02.530
If I had a woman like you, I would
give her anything her heart desired.

02:04.446 --> 02:07.700
Maybe I should blow off my date
and go out with a guy like you.

02:07.733 --> 02:12.117
And when I say, "a guy like you,"
I mean you, specifically.

02:15.383 --> 02:17.095
Wow.

02:17.795 --> 02:20.895
But just to be clear, I still
have a tip coming, right?

02:24.294 --> 02:27.561

steven. Steven, would you please stop
doing that? You're gonna get all eric-Y.

03:09.069 --> 03:10.303
Give.

03:11.269 --> 03:15.786
Jackie, boys have to play fight because
they secretly want to touch each other.

03:18.069 --> 03:20.549
Yeah, you guys wish
you could play fight.

03:20.599 --> 03:23.999
But girls can't, 'cause it
always turns into a real fight.

03:24.133 --> 03:27.649
Are you seriously telling me that if jackie
and i wanted to play fight, we couldn't?

03:27.699 --> 03:30.016
Um, let me listen for the
echo of what I just said.

03:30.066 --> 03:33.166
Girls can't play fight.
Yep! That's what I think.

03:34.916 --> 03:37.916
I agree. Girls
are bitches.

03:38.821 --> 03:40.237
Really?

03:41.387 --> 03:43.537
- Come on, jackie. Put your dukes up.
- Okay.

03:43.587 --> 03:46.287
Watch and learn, boys.

03:49.281 --> 03:51.764
See, it's all fun and games.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.464
Ow, you scratched me!

03:55.098 --> 03:56.765
Get off of me, bigfoot!

03:56.815 --> 04:00.548
Let go of my hair or I'll
pound your tiny ass!

04:05.131 --> 04:07.653
- Spoilsport.
- Hey,

04:08.003 --> 04:10.169
yours is gonna kill mine.

04:14.319 --> 04:16.839
Ladies,that was pathetic.

04:16.886 --> 04:19.302
What?
That wasn't even real.

04:19.351 --> 04:20.452
- We're fine.
- Yeah.

04:20.502 --> 04:23.102
I don't know what you're
talking about. I had fun.

04:23.219 --> 04:25.669
Oh, you're so immature!

04:30.319 --> 04:33.152
You guys aren't going
to believe this.

04:33.719 --> 04:34.769
Wait.

04:34.919 --> 04:37.719
Were two hot girls
just fighting in here?

04:38.636 --> 04:39.802
No.

04:40.252 --> 04:41.928
Someone is lying.

04:42.995 --> 04:44.195
Anyway,

04:44.278 --> 04:47.345
I was just shampooing this foxy girl
danielle, and the next thing I know,

04:47.378 --> 04:50.228
we're making out
in the shampoo closet.

04:50.495 --> 04:54.007
Wait a second, you're trying to tell me that you
were shampooing a girl and she got so horny,

04:54.048 --> 04:56.836
she had to make out with you
in the shampoo closet?

04:57.029 --> 04:59.995
That doesn't sound real, man.
That sounds like a mad lib.

05:03.349 --> 05:06.849
Yeah, are you sure you
weren't just kissing a mop?

05:09.616 --> 05:11.760
'Cause, man, I've
seen you do that.

05:12.660 --> 05:14.110
No, no.

05:14.144 --> 05:17.616
Danielle kept going on and on about this
adorable knucklehead she was dating,

05:17.633 --> 05:20.171
and I just sympathized
with her problems.

05:20.527 --> 05:22.127
Well, that makes sense.

05:22.157 --> 05:25.107
I mean, all a woman really
wants is a man who listens.

05:25.157 --> 05:26.457
I listen.

05:26.707 --> 05:29.273
And doesn't pat
himself on the back.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.807
I never pat myself
on the back.

05:33.096 --> 05:35.379
So, yeah, I got that
going for me.

05:36.296 --> 05:40.346
You guys, something happened today
that has never happened to me before.

05:40.404 --> 05:42.846
Oh, you did long division?

05:44.004 --> 05:45.871
No, I got stood up.

05:45.921 --> 05:49.504
I was supposed to meet this girl danielle
after her haircut, and she never showed.

05:49.578 --> 05:50.972
Danielle!

05:51.485 --> 05:53.135
Danielle?

05:53.402 --> 05:56.302
Okay, wait a second, first
a girl fight and now this?

05:56.335 --> 05:58.902
I vote "best day ever."

06:01.969 --> 06:05.452
Kelso is the adorable knucklehead.

06:06.036 --> 06:09.202
Hey, thanks, fez, but I'm
trying to tella story here.

06:10.019 --> 06:12.737
Okay, so I've been trying to figure
out why she didn't show,

06:12.785 --> 06:15.319
and I've come to the only
logical conclusion--

06:15.369 --> 06:17.069
she's dead.

06:19.702 --> 06:22.587
Kelso, maybe danielle met a guy
that she likes better than you.

06:22.637 --> 06:26.404
Don't be crazy, fez. Danielle is dead,
and wecan never bring her back.

06:30.920 --> 06:34.370
Kitty, we don't need
"the joy of sex."

06:34.404 --> 06:39.720
Well,  why not? It's not dirty. This book--
it doesn't even have photographs, just

06:39.937 --> 06:41.970
sketches.

06:42.554 --> 06:46.287
But they're so detailed.
They draw in every single part.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.620
And it's not to scale.

06:49.587 --> 06:52.387
Oh, here's a fun idea.

06:52.421 --> 06:53.804
okay.

06:54.804 --> 07:00.473
Instead of throwing away our old dish
towels, we can use them as blindfolds

07:00.523 --> 07:05.440
and play a sexy bedroom
version of marco polo.

07:06.448 --> 07:10.448
oh, come on. Don't you want to be
one of those fun, older couples?

07:10.498 --> 07:15.481
Kitty, I want us to grow old
and withdraw into ourselves.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.063
Hey,  what's for lunch?

07:19.630 --> 07:23.596
Well, I was thinking of making something, but that
would mean I would have to look at a cookbook,

07:23.646 --> 07:27.446
and I don't like to learn
new things from books.

07:29.313 --> 07:31.729
Yeah, so is
lunch off or, um...

07:32.313 --> 07:35.313
I mean, what's the lay
of the lunch land here?

07:35.363 --> 07:40.563
I don't see why I have to read
a book on bodily functions.

07:40.980 --> 07:44.980
I've never read a book on eating,
yet I'm extremely well fed.

07:45.163 --> 07:47.563
But I'm not.
Could I, like...

07:48.896 --> 07:51.596
seriously, like a
sandwich or...

07:51.979 --> 07:53.629
well, you know what?

07:53.896 --> 07:58.063
Nobody is eating unless you
give this book a try. Until then,

07:58.096 --> 08:00.213
I quit cooking.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.532
Wow, I can't believe I'm
asking you this, but

08:05.865 --> 08:08.499
please have kinky sex
with my mother.

08:15.682 --> 08:20.049
No, danielle, I love your outfit. But
I just think you can always go tighter.

08:20.866 --> 08:23.775
Oh, my god!
Danielle, you're alive!

08:23.825 --> 08:25.708
Yeah, why
wouldn't I be?

08:26.192 --> 08:27.208
Well,

08:27.258 --> 08:31.108
thenif you're not dead, then--
then why did you blow off our date?

08:31.158 --> 08:33.890
Look at him try
and put it together.

08:34.941 --> 08:37.274
He's got it now.

08:37.758 --> 08:39.607
No, wait, he doesn't.

08:40.140 --> 08:43.207
Yeah, now--wow.
Not yet. Wow.

08:43.408 --> 08:46.528
This is, like, the
slowest burn ever.

08:46.620 --> 08:50.894
This is like how burns were in the
1800s before we had electricity.

08:50.935 --> 08:54.864
Danielle stood you up so she could make out
with the adorable new man in her life.

08:54.869 --> 08:56.718
Ah--me.

08:56.768 --> 08:59.706
That's right.
Ah--him.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.811
don't bump me.

09:15.943 --> 09:17.889
Don't get in
my way.

09:18.137 --> 09:24.427
Well, maybe I wouldn't be in your way if you could sit
still like a normal person instead of a vibrating spazoid.

09:25.104 --> 09:26.276
Really?

09:26.309 --> 09:30.503
Well, guess what.
You fight like a poor girl.

09:31.378 --> 09:33.244
get off me!

09:33.270 --> 09:35.090
get off me!

09:35.140 --> 09:37.550
this ain't over, squatty!

09:37.910 --> 09:40.590
Get off. I'm going.

09:42.837 --> 09:46.782
Hey, if they're gonna keep this up,
we should invest in a video camera.

09:48.208 --> 09:53.111
All right, fez, stand up so I can kick your ass.
How dare you steal a girl out from under me!

09:53.144 --> 09:56.166
First of all, I can do
whatever I want.

09:56.364 --> 10:00.762
Second of all, when I stole her,
she was not under you, she was under moi.

10:01.439 --> 10:02.231
That's it.

10:02.264 --> 10:04.906
Whoa! Whoa!
Guys, listen.

10:04.956 --> 10:09.540
I just realized I am not strong enough
to hold you two apart. Hyde, come on.

10:13.635 --> 10:14.757
Kelso,

10:14.807 --> 10:18.291
Maybe you shouldn't be asking what he did.
You should be asking what you did to let it happen.

10:18.324 --> 10:20.240
Or what you didn't do.

10:20.306 --> 10:22.419
You know, maybe you
just lost your mojo.

10:22.469 --> 10:26.794
Look, a guy can't
just lose his mojo, okay?

10:28.016 --> 10:29.402
Can he?

10:30.260 --> 10:33.084
Well, when was the last time
you made out with two girls at once?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.239
that was...

10:35.725 --> 10:37.095
oh, no.

10:38.533 --> 10:40.184
I can't remember.

10:40.233 --> 10:42.974
Kissed four different girls
in the same day?

10:43.007 --> 10:45.021
I don't know!

10:45.500 --> 10:48.142
You guys, I might've
lost my mojo.

10:48.786 --> 10:51.989
And I got it.
I got your mojo.

10:52.996 --> 10:56.518
Which reminds me,
I also have your yo-yo, so...

10:57.634 --> 10:59.342
I want 'em both back.

10:59.375 --> 11:03.272
You know, how can I lose a girl to you?
You don't even speak english.

11:03.817 --> 11:05.550
Well, kelso, look at
the bright side.

11:05.583 --> 11:08.704
Danielle is a wonderful girl
who likes me better than you.

11:09.265 --> 11:11.998
Why is that
the bright side?

11:12.411 --> 11:14.937
Because...
burn !!!

11:26.770 --> 11:28.438
these are stale.

11:29.676 --> 11:32.384
Well, eat slow.
We gotta make 'em last.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.448
Hey ya, red.

11:34.976 --> 11:39.479
Eric told me you and kitty are having a little
trouble in the old hee-hoo department.

11:40.238 --> 11:42.021
You told bob?

11:42.071 --> 11:44.960
Are you
out of your puny mind?

11:45.389 --> 11:47.734
Look, you have to work
this stuff out with mom.

11:47.769 --> 11:50.312
She hasn't fed us in
three days. Dad,

11:50.345 --> 11:52.937
I can't afford
not to eat.

11:53.284 --> 11:56.388
Yesterday I ate a
raisin off the floor.

11:57.098 --> 11:59.888
I'm not even sure
if it was really a raisin.

12:00.641 --> 12:02.226
Look, red,

12:02.259 --> 12:05.544
you should take kitty's request
for a love life spice up seriously.

12:05.594 --> 12:07.955
When midge wanted
to turbocharge our love life,

12:07.988 --> 12:11.207
it was really a symptom
of a much deeper marital problem.

12:11.257 --> 12:13.441
Yeah, that you
were deviants.

12:13.618 --> 12:17.998
Deviants? Well, the couple we were
dating sure didn't seem to think so.

12:18.362 --> 12:21.666
I'm tellin' you, this problem
is not just about sex.

12:21.712 --> 12:22.762
It isn't?

12:22.979 --> 12:26.520
Well, maybe she's just unhappy emotionally.
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

12:26.586 --> 12:30.186
No, red. It means you have a problem.
And you have to deal with it.

12:31.020 --> 12:32.386
Yeah, okay.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.913
Yeah, I guess it's important that kitty get
listened to. Eric, go listen to your mother.

12:37.946 --> 12:38.763
Why me?

12:38.796 --> 12:41.713
Because without food,
you'll die first.

12:45.846 --> 12:49.213
So,  danielle, tell me again how much
more you like me than kelso.

12:49.263 --> 12:51.863
Well, you're sensitive

12:52.029 --> 12:54.363
and thoughtful
and understanding

12:54.396 --> 12:56.149
and very, very sexy.

12:56.182 --> 12:58.732
Lady, don't ever
stop talking.

12:59.066 --> 13:01.182
And you're funny
and sweet.

13:01.216 --> 13:03.499
And did I mention?
Very, very sexy.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.782
Lady, you gotta shut up.

13:11.142 --> 13:14.192
So, mom, in the
interest of returning

13:14.242 --> 13:18.309
regular meal service
to my now shattered life...

13:19.375 --> 13:22.925
I'm here to help. So, uh, just
tell me the problem beneath

13:22.975 --> 13:25.234
the dirty,
gross problem.

13:25.551 --> 13:27.434
Honey, there is none.

13:27.467 --> 13:33.201
I just want your father and me to have
more adventurous sexual intercourse.

13:33.701 --> 13:37.121
Well, this is one of those times
I'm kinda happy my stomach's empty.

13:37.188 --> 13:39.471
Um, look, instead
of calling it,

13:39.504 --> 13:42.288
uh, sexual inter--ah.
Ahem.

13:43.871 --> 13:45.621
Instead of
calling it that,

13:45.788 --> 13:48.948
why don't we call it,
like, a walk in the park?

13:49.648 --> 13:56.231
Fine. I want your father and ito have
more adventurous walks in the park.

13:56.281 --> 13:59.811
I want to walk in the
park in the kitchen.

14:00.344 --> 14:03.294
walk in the park
on a tuesday.

14:03.394 --> 14:05.977
I even want to walk
in the park in the park.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.394
Okay, okay, okay.

14:08.011 --> 14:09.577
Okay, um...

14:10.494 --> 14:13.777
okay, um, mom, I think you're--
you're playing this all wrong.

14:13.844 --> 14:16.754
Dad wants you to have
a deeper emotional issue.

14:16.804 --> 14:18.321
Invent one.

14:18.721 --> 14:21.854
He'll give you anything you
want to avoid talking about

14:21.971 --> 14:23.737
walks in the park.

14:23.938 --> 14:28.238
So think big. You know, I might be able to
get you diamonds here. Maybe even a new car.

14:28.288 --> 14:32.110
This is like emotional "price is right,"
baby. You're in the showcase.

14:32.543 --> 14:33.760
Oh!

14:33.943 --> 14:38.227
I also want to walk in the
park during "the price is right."

14:49.152 --> 14:50.968
Well, what's the news?

14:52.685 --> 14:54.658
You better start studying.

15:05.009 --> 15:06.126
All right.

15:06.893 --> 15:10.009
So I spent the whole day thinking
about what happened with danielle.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.243
And I realized that
I shouldn't be mad at you.

15:13.543 --> 15:15.869
I should be asking
you for help.

15:16.436 --> 15:19.553
Holy crap, man. Now you're
asking fez for girl advice?

15:19.603 --> 15:23.353
Next thing you know donna's gonna be
asking forman how to throw a ball.

15:23.836 --> 15:25.819
Look, he's the one
with the girl.

15:25.853 --> 15:27.886
All right, fez. So
where'd I go wrong?

15:27.936 --> 15:32.069
Well, danielle said you were a bad listener
and I'm a good listener. I heard her.

15:32.269 --> 15:35.319
But so what?
I hurt girls all the time.

15:35.369 --> 15:38.252
No, not "hurt."
Heard.I heard.

15:38.302 --> 15:41.035
- You heard what?
- Danielle.I heard danielle.

15:41.085 --> 15:44.935
Why'd she choose you over me?
Jeez. It's like talking to a 2 year old here.

15:46.419 --> 15:51.891
She chose fez because he listens when a
woman talks instead of staring at her chest.

15:54.591 --> 15:56.608
Stop staring
at my chest!

15:56.675 --> 16:00.565
I'm sorry. Look, I've been
screwed by darwinism.

16:00.908 --> 16:05.775
I never needed to evolve listening skills
'cause my looks are so highly developed.

16:06.542 --> 16:09.290
Oh, that's not
how evolution works.

16:09.324 --> 16:10.857
Yeah, sure it is.
Look,

16:10.890 --> 16:14.507
say I had to catch my own food, right?
But I only ate really fast animals.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.840
My feet would eventually
evolve into rockets.

16:21.407 --> 16:25.306
Man, it's amazing your brain
doesn't evolve into pudding.

16:26.023 --> 16:28.335
All right, fez,come on.
I need your help.

16:28.368 --> 16:30.268
Why should I help you?

16:30.385 --> 16:31.918
B-because you owe me.

16:31.968 --> 16:36.385
Think about all the times that I set you up
with my dates' less-pretty friends.

16:37.052 --> 16:39.880
That's true. You have
thrown me some uggos.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.764
All right, so show
a little appreciation.

16:44.130 --> 16:45.330
Fine.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.847
But you have to promise not to use what
I teach you on danielle to get her back.

16:48.891 --> 16:50.541
- She's mine.
- Done.

16:51.007 --> 16:52.941
Okay, donna,
I need your help.

16:53.124 --> 16:56.291
Now sit here
and pretend to be a girl.

16:56.957 --> 16:59.341
Now tell a girlie story.
Kelso,

16:59.407 --> 17:02.107
you listen and repeat
back whatever she says.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.290
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

17:06.540 --> 17:08.490
kelso, I had the worst day.

17:08.522 --> 17:11.607
I didn't know what shoes to wear--
with a heel, without a heel...

17:11.656 --> 17:14.040
I'm running out of firecrackers.

17:15.147 --> 17:18.381
I bet I could a been best
friends with spider-man.

17:20.075 --> 17:21.974
Is that a new muscle?

17:22.540 --> 17:26.558
Well, hello, new muscle.
Welcome to kelso town.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.224
Kelso.

17:28.275 --> 17:29.742
Kelso!

17:29.775 --> 17:30.642
What?

17:30.692 --> 17:32.625
You weren't
even listening.

17:32.658 --> 17:33.692
How do you know?

17:33.725 --> 17:37.158
'Cause you were staring at the ceiling
with your tongue hanging out.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.258
Kelso, when a woman talks,

17:39.292 --> 17:43.242
you have to look her in the eyes and pretend
her words are like oxygen and without them,

17:43.275 --> 17:45.009
you can't breathe.

17:46.975 --> 17:49.609
But I don't care
what she says.

17:51.366 --> 17:53.382
How the heck
did you ever get a girl?

17:53.432 --> 17:57.849
I don't know. I just stare at her
until she stops talking, then I kiss her.

17:58.266 --> 17:59.932
Unbelievable.

18:11.029 --> 18:12.404
All right, kitty.

18:13.087 --> 18:15.537
I want you to be
happy,I really do.

18:15.620 --> 18:20.220
And to make that beautiful,
illusive dream come true,

18:20.737 --> 18:24.610
I'm willing to try
page 46.

18:25.877 --> 18:27.627
Really?

18:27.827 --> 18:31.127
Oh, red, thank you.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.443
Oh.

18:34.925 --> 18:39.492
Page 46--
that is so fancy.

18:40.209 --> 18:41.425
what?

18:42.125 --> 18:44.592
Oh,  dear god, no!
Not, uh,

18:44.642 --> 18:48.937
not page 46. I meant
page 47. Page 47.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.370
And no funny stuff
after I fall asleep.

18:56.550 --> 19:00.133
And I didn't know what to do because I had
just polished my nails and I didn't wanna

19:00.167 --> 19:03.183
mess up my manicure.

19:03.617 --> 19:06.855
You're such a good listener.
I can't take it anymore.

19:06.988 --> 19:09.005
What are you doing?
Get off my lady!

19:09.038 --> 19:11.872
- Fez!
- You shut your hot little mouth.

19:12.438 --> 19:14.672
You promised you wouldn't use
anything I taught you on danielle.

19:14.705 --> 19:18.220
Come on, you can't give me a gun
and expect me not to shoot people with it.

19:18.854 --> 19:20.704
Danielle, you have to choose.
Him or me?

19:20.754 --> 19:23.120
- But I--
- I said choose, woman!

19:23.470 --> 19:27.670
Well, fez, if I have to choose between the
two of you, I mean, the choice is obvious.

19:29.050 --> 19:30.617
I choose you, fez.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.650
What are you, stupid?

19:33.350 --> 19:36.800
I mean, I mean, of course.
Yes, good choice. Yes.

19:36.867 --> 19:38.800
Wait. Him? How can
you choose him?

19:38.842 --> 19:42.775
I don't know. I guess I have this thing
for guys who boss me around.

19:43.108 --> 19:46.825
I'll meet you in the car, or
wherever you tell me to meet you.

19:47.675 --> 19:50.465
Oh, you'll meet me in
the car,and you'll like it.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.248
I will.

19:56.198 --> 19:57.265
Okay,

19:57.715 --> 19:59.548
here's the thing, fez...

20:00.365 --> 20:03.388
she's clearly a lunatic,

20:04.105 --> 20:09.172
which means that she'sgonna be super
hot in bed, so congratulations on that one.

20:09.355 --> 20:13.741
But you did snake her from me.
So I get a free punch.

20:15.374 --> 20:18.124
But you did snake her back, so...

20:30.876 --> 20:34.805
How do guys play fight
without getting into a real fight?

20:35.188 --> 20:40.538
Well, maybe'cause when they fight, michael
doesn't elbow everything like a blonde tard-O.

20:41.972 --> 20:44.958
See? Now that is gonna
get your ass kicked.

20:45.425 --> 20:48.908
Oh, I'm gonna punch you
in your fat melon head.

20:48.958 --> 20:52.508
Good luck reaching
it, tiny loser.

21:08.014 --> 21:09.831
thanks, tommy.

21:13.731 --> 21:16.047
Is that bacon I smell?

21:16.414 --> 21:18.777
Oh, what a perfect morning.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.769
- marco!
- polo!

21:21.819 --> 21:23.627
Oh, my god!
