00:10.468 --> 00:11.702
Okay, so I've been
a little worried

00:11.769 --> 00:13.270
That Ann maybe thinks
that our relationship

00:13.338 --> 00:15.272
Isn't moving forward
fast enough.

00:15.340 --> 00:18.842
And so I'm wondering
if maybe I should ask her

00:18.910 --> 00:21.334
If she would like to move in
with me.

00:21.402 --> 00:23.572
Good idea? Bad idea?
You tell me.

00:23.639 --> 00:25.272
Well, I would say
that some women

00:25.339 --> 00:26.975
Won't consider moving in
with someone

00:27.042 --> 00:28.412
Unless they think
marriage is in the future,

00:28.479 --> 00:33.434
Which I know for you is--
- I intend to marry her.

00:33.502 --> 00:34.673
For realskies?

00:34.740 --> 00:36.875
I'm not really quite sure
how I feel.

00:36.943 --> 00:39.579
Um, I--it--
it's a little weird.

00:39.646 --> 00:41.381
I mean, I'm happy for them.
They're my friends.

00:41.449 --> 00:42.749
It makes me a little nauseous.

00:42.817 --> 00:46.489
If I could just sum it up
in one word, it would be, um...

Why don't I try to rustle up
seven more meetings

'cause I think
it would be cooler

02:32.719 --> 02:33.919
If there were an even 100.

deputy director.

02:53.011 --> 02:55.179
Bill Haggardy,
Pawnee historical society.

02:55.247 --> 02:56.981
I'm supposed to be meeting
with Ron Swanson.

02:57.049 --> 02:59.083
I understand that.
He's tied up right now.

02:59.151 --> 03:00.318
What a shocker.

03:00.386 --> 03:01.920
I've been trying
to meet with him three months

03:01.988 --> 03:03.155
And now he's not available.

03:03.222 --> 03:04.423
It's probably too late now,

03:04.490 --> 03:06.459
But, uh, some rich woman,
Jessica wicks,

03:06.526 --> 03:08.861
Has rented out turnbill mansion
for a party

03:08.929 --> 03:10.764

03:25.713 --> 03:29.950

was beautiful and romantic.

03:30.017 --> 03:31.251
But then word got out

03:31.319 --> 03:35.989
And the reception
was a bloodbath.

03:36.057 --> 03:39.159
Fortunately,
there were two survivors.

03:39.227 --> 03:41.662
Unfortunately,
they were both horses.

Jessica wicks?

03:45.100 --> 03:46.601
- Yes.
- I'm Tom Haverford.

03:46.669 --> 03:48.503
I'm gonna be running point
on this, bill.

03:48.571 --> 03:49.704
Why didn't you try to stop her?

03:49.772 --> 03:51.039
Her husband
is Nick Newport, Sr.

03:51.107 --> 03:52.374
From sweetums.

03:52.442 --> 03:54.343

is afraid to say no to him.

03:54.411 --> 03:55.511
Okay, everybody just relax.

03:55.579 --> 03:57.880
What alterations
is she trying to make?

03:57.948 --> 04:01.484
Drilling holes. Painting.
Uh, removing wainscoting.

04:01.551 --> 04:03.653
Uh, she's tearing down
the gazebo.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.088
What? She's what?
No, she's not.

04:06.156 --> 04:07.390
Okay, Tom, go get the car.

04:07.457 --> 04:09.525
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry.

04:09.593 --> 04:11.894
- Don't throw things at me.
- Oh, these are tight.

I'll devise an action plan

04:14.298 --> 04:16.065

among the departments.

a gazebo.

- Oh, hey, Ann.

04:36.953 --> 04:39.054
Sorry I can't hang out.
I kind of have an emergency.

04:39.122 --> 04:40.689
Oh, I'm actually here
to see mark.

04:40.757 --> 04:42.992
Right. Oh, well,
thanks for the coffee.

04:43.059 --> 04:45.728
- That's also for mark.
- Mm. I really need it though.

04:45.795 --> 04:48.764
But next time more sugar.
Okay, thanks. Bye!

04:48.832 --> 04:50.333
Um, do you want me
to postpone the rest?

04:50.400 --> 04:52.936
Or I could set myself on fire
and create a diversion.

04:53.004 --> 04:54.938
No. I'm gonna do
all of these today.

04:55.006 --> 04:56.373
Round up whoever's free.

04:56.441 --> 04:59.476
I'm gonna need more
Ron Swansons.

04:59.544 --> 05:01.778
Look at that.
It's gorgeous.

05:01.846 --> 05:04.715
What kind of monster
would want to change this?

05:04.782 --> 05:07.117
- Ugh! Pre-zit.

05:07.185 --> 05:09.486
Do you have any, uh,
brown concealer by any chance?

05:09.554 --> 05:11.254
I need to look good
for Jessica.

05:11.322 --> 05:13.757
They may be rich, but they
can't just destroy history.

05:13.825 --> 05:15.558
Let's go.
Right behind you.

05:15.626 --> 05:19.662
I just need to spend a minute
on my cologne cloud.

05:19.730 --> 05:22.499
- [coughs] what is that?
- Attack by Dennis Feinstein.

05:22.566 --> 05:23.767
When you want to attack
the senses

05:23.834 --> 05:25.135
Of the lady you want to bed.

05:25.203 --> 05:28.271
- Oh, my God.
- Door! Door! Door! Door!

05:28.339 --> 05:29.773
Close it.
Ugh.

05:29.840 --> 05:33.110
So basically,
we're completely swamped.

05:33.177 --> 05:34.678
All hands on deck.

05:34.746 --> 05:36.079
I don't even work
in this building.

05:36.147 --> 05:38.615
Don't care. I need anyone
with a pulse and a brain

05:38.683 --> 05:39.683
To pitch in.

05:39.751 --> 05:41.985
Ron, do you need help
with anything?

05:42.053 --> 05:43.253
No. We're good. Thanks.

05:43.321 --> 05:45.822
In fact,
you can head home early.

05:45.890 --> 05:47.424
Right now the four of us
are going to divvy up

05:47.492 --> 05:48.759
All these meetings.

05:48.827 --> 05:50.293
Just make 'em feel
like they've been heard.

05:50.361 --> 05:51.995
Understood?
Yes, sir.

05:52.063 --> 05:55.999
Bert Macklin, FBI, on the case.

05:56.066 --> 05:58.134
April,
you take Leslie's office.

05:58.202 --> 05:59.602
Andy,
you're in the conference room.

05:59.670 --> 06:01.505
Ann, take your meetings
in the courtyard.

06:01.573 --> 06:05.309
Just sit there
and don't ruin the city.

06:05.377 --> 06:08.847
Dismissed.

06:08.915 --> 06:10.015
What are you doing?

06:10.083 --> 06:12.318
Can I get a badge?

06:12.386 --> 06:16.523
Hey. Brought you coffee.
Help you get through the day.

06:16.591 --> 06:22.129
- Thanks, dude.
- No problem, lady.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.434
I'm gonna go.
Okay.

06:27.502 --> 06:31.038
April is the best.
But she's 20.

06:31.106 --> 06:33.040
When April was born,
I was already in 3rd grade.

06:33.108 --> 06:34.875
Which means if we were
friends back then,

06:34.943 --> 06:37.711
I'd have been hanging out
with a baby.

06:37.779 --> 06:41.047
I don't know anything
about infant care.

06:41.115 --> 06:45.585
My God, I could've killed her.

06:45.652 --> 06:47.386
Ah, Mr. Newport, Sr.

06:47.454 --> 06:48.854
I've just been informed
that you plan

06:48.922 --> 06:50.189
On altering this mansion.

06:50.257 --> 06:52.258
And as a member
of the parks department,

06:52.325 --> 06:54.460
As a pawneean, and an American,

06:54.527 --> 06:56.528
I ask you to refrain

06:56.596 --> 06:59.565
From harming this historic
structure.

06:59.632 --> 07:00.699
What?

07:00.767 --> 07:02.302
I'll take care of this,
love nut.

07:02.369 --> 07:04.704
- Biscuit.
- Yeah. Hi.

07:04.772 --> 07:08.241
I'm Jessica wicks.
Miss Pawnee 1994.

07:08.308 --> 07:09.475
Hello.
Yes, we've met before.

07:09.543 --> 07:11.277
We were both judges
at the pageant last year.

07:11.345 --> 07:14.181
Leslie Knorp.
Of course. How are you?

07:14.249 --> 07:16.683
Jessica wicks! Hey, boo.

07:16.751 --> 07:19.353
Are you aging in reverse
'cause you look barely legal?

07:19.421 --> 07:20.621
Tom Haverford.

07:20.689 --> 07:22.557
If you're not the most
charming man in Indiana.

07:22.624 --> 07:25.293
And this must be
the luckiest man in Indiana.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.763
Sir, it is an honor
to meet you.

07:28.831 --> 07:32.200
Come here, you.

07:32.268 --> 07:35.470
Tell me straight.
Are you a Chinese?

07:35.538 --> 07:38.807
No. I'm one of
the Indian people.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.442
That floppy old bag of money

07:40.509 --> 07:42.777
Is gonna be dead in, like,
a month.

07:42.845 --> 07:44.946
And who's going
to comfort Jessica

07:45.014 --> 07:47.182
And her millions of dollars?

07:47.250 --> 07:51.253
Yeah, Jessica's a gold digger,
but I'm a gold digger digger.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.590
So how did you
and Mr. Newport meet?

07:54.657 --> 07:57.626
Well, I was doing a ribbon
cutting at the hospital.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.230
And he was there
because his blood doesn't work.

08:00.297 --> 08:01.965
And we started talking.

08:02.033 --> 08:03.734
And then I realized who he was.

08:03.801 --> 08:07.471
[laughs] oh, my gosh.
It was love at first sight.

08:07.539 --> 08:09.640
Oh, that sounds so romantic.

08:09.708 --> 08:12.243
Um, Jessica, I know
you've rented out this house

08:12.311 --> 08:14.412
For a party, but it's
on the historical register

08:14.480 --> 08:15.847
So we can't allow any changes.

08:15.915 --> 08:17.248
I--I'm so sorry.

08:17.316 --> 08:20.285
[laughs] it's a little late
for that, sweetheart.

08:20.352 --> 08:22.320
I told them what I was doing
months ago.

08:22.388 --> 08:24.089
Where I come from
there's a saying

08:24.157 --> 08:26.091
"what's done is done."
Hmm.

08:26.159 --> 08:27.459
That's a saying everywhere.

08:27.527 --> 08:28.561
I've never heard it before

08:28.628 --> 08:29.862
And I think
it's a great saying.

08:29.930 --> 08:31.397
Well, maybe we can just limit
the damage.

08:31.465 --> 08:34.768
How much have you done?
You painted this?

08:34.836 --> 08:37.871
- Uh-huh. Miami teal is Nicky's
favorite color.

08:37.938 --> 08:40.107
We also replaced
some of the sconces,

08:40.174 --> 08:42.943
Got rid of the furniture,
painted these floors black.

08:43.010 --> 08:44.232
Oh, my God, these were
the original hardwood floors.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.801
Yeah. They were all
scratched up.

08:46.869 --> 08:48.903
I did you a favor.
Come on in here.

08:48.971 --> 08:50.638
I'll show you guys
what we did in the sitting room.

08:50.706 --> 08:52.773
After you.
I'd hate to miss the view.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.204
I should just pay you
to follow me around.

08:57.271 --> 08:58.805
If that's a job offer,
I accept.

08:58.873 --> 09:00.607
Oh, my God.

09:00.675 --> 09:03.009
Why did you have to drill holes
in the wall?

09:03.077 --> 09:06.379
To hang my birthday present
to Nicky.

09:06.447 --> 09:07.881
My heavens.

09:07.949 --> 09:11.752
- Isn't there a way that
that you--oh, my.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.386
History is important.

09:13.454 --> 09:15.155
You just can't go around
changing everything

09:15.223 --> 09:17.090
All the time or else
next thing you know

09:17.158 --> 09:19.960
They'll be painting
the white house...

09:20.027 --> 09:22.562
Not white.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.966
I'm so angry,
I can't think of another color.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.334
Green.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.602
So your department banned me
from attending games

09:29.670 --> 09:32.171
Just because I yell
"you suck" at the players.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.573
According to the complaint,

09:33.640 --> 09:36.075
You yelled it
at five-year-old girls.

09:40.939 --> 09:43.340
I thought I was having
this meeting with Ron Swanson.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.576
I'm afraid that Ron Swanson's

09:45.643 --> 09:46.877
Currently dead.

09:46.945 --> 09:48.278
- Oh.
- I'm his daughter.

09:48.346 --> 09:50.113
April Swanson.

09:50.181 --> 09:52.349
And it's his last wish

09:52.417 --> 09:54.484
That I have this meeting
with you.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.653
I represent the ultimate
Frisbee league.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.089
- Pawnee has an ultimate league?
- Yes.

09:59.157 --> 10:01.124
And we keep running
into conflicts--

10:01.192 --> 10:03.994
- You won me over.
I will join your team.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.196
- I'm sorry,
um, what we need--

10:06.264 --> 10:08.365
- When does practice start?
And do you provide the jerseys?

10:08.433 --> 10:09.900
What color are the jerseys
by the way?

10:09.968 --> 10:13.503
What's our team name?
Are we "the lightning"?

10:13.571 --> 10:14.805
Now, I have to tell you,

10:14.873 --> 10:16.640
I don't actually work
in the parks department.

10:16.708 --> 10:19.576
I'm a nurse.
Seriously?

10:19.644 --> 10:20.744
That's great news.

10:20.812 --> 10:24.581
I have the weirdest thing
on my arm.

10:24.649 --> 10:28.151
Can you see this?
Every time.

10:28.219 --> 10:30.921
Well, thank God you haven't
torn down the gazebo yet.

10:30.989 --> 10:32.823
Ugh. Don't remind me.

10:32.891 --> 10:35.425
The demolition people couldn't
get here until this afternoon.

10:35.493 --> 10:38.095
I've had to look
at that ugly thing all day long.

10:38.162 --> 10:40.230
Ugly thing?

10:40.298 --> 10:41.498
Let me tell you
a little something

10:41.566 --> 10:43.467
About this ugly thing, ma'am.

10:43.534 --> 10:45.469
150 years ago,
an interracial couple

10:45.536 --> 10:46.970
Was married here
and then slaughtered

10:47.038 --> 10:48.572
By their own families.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.208
It's one of the most beautiful
stories in Pawnee's history.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.609
Why are you trying
to destroy it?

10:52.677 --> 10:54.544
Don't tell me
about Pawnee history.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.480
The newports made this town.

10:58.839 --> 11:03.276
85th birthday without this
mushy, old, pile of rot.

11:03.344 --> 11:05.044
Your husband's
a mushy, old, pile of rot.

11:05.112 --> 11:06.446
You were a stick in the mud

11:06.514 --> 11:08.314
When we judged
that beauty pageant

11:08.382 --> 11:10.450
And you're being
a stick in the mud now!

11:10.518 --> 11:12.552
I am not a stick in the mud!

11:12.620 --> 11:16.589
I-I just want to stop a party
from happening.

11:16.657 --> 11:18.725
Ron, I have a gazebo update

11:18.792 --> 11:20.994
So ignore all my previous
voicemails and emails.

11:21.061 --> 11:23.863
Uh, Leslie, I haven't
relieved myself in five hours.

11:23.931 --> 11:25.932
So if you'll excuse me.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.300
Ron, I'm sorry,
but this can't wait.

11:27.368 --> 11:30.370
Jessica wicks refuses--
- Leslie, what the [bleep]?

11:30.437 --> 11:31.838
- Hey!
- Miss Knope!

11:31.906 --> 11:33.706
Councilman Howser!
Nice to see you again.

11:33.774 --> 11:35.608
Not that I saw anything
other than your face.

11:35.676 --> 11:37.076
And I would like to talk
to you a little bit

11:37.144 --> 11:38.278
About this gazebo thing.

11:38.345 --> 11:39.546
You know, the p--
okay. Okay.

11:39.613 --> 11:42.582
Enough of this.
Do whatever you want.

11:42.650 --> 11:44.984
Alert the media.
Call FEMA. I don't care.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.420
Do not bother me
with this again.

11:47.488 --> 11:51.758
[sighs]

11:51.825 --> 11:53.860
- Miss Knope.
- Councilman Howser.

11:53.928 --> 11:55.495
I saw your penis.

11:55.563 --> 11:58.298
There are eight swings
at Ramsett park

11:58.365 --> 12:00.333
And every single one of them
is broken.

12:00.401 --> 12:02.435
Can you please
just fix one of them?

12:03.003 --> 12:05.938
Ron told me I can't
say yes to anything.

12:06.006 --> 12:09.608
But it's such
a reasonable request,

12:09.676 --> 12:11.243
I can't just say no.

12:12.211 --> 12:15.480
[crackling exhale]
So that's a "yes"?

12:16.007 --> 12:18.141
Just say out loud
"yes" or "no".

12:18.209 --> 12:23.980
- Eeeeeee-boop!

12:24.048 --> 12:26.783
Yeah, they do look
a little bit swollen.

12:26.851 --> 12:29.419
Just follow the pen.

12:29.487 --> 12:32.922
Follow the pen t...

12:32.990 --> 12:35.191
Does--does that hurt?

12:35.259 --> 12:36.626
[exhales]

12:37.694 --> 12:39.228
There's no way
this ordinance goes through.

12:39.295 --> 12:40.229
There's too much red tape.

12:40.296 --> 12:41.530
Mm. This gridlock
drives me nuts.

12:41.598 --> 12:42.698
Tell me about it.

12:42.766 --> 12:44.066
Yeah, I think
you're gonna have to make

12:44.134 --> 12:45.200
An end run, you know?

12:45.268 --> 12:46.568
Go right to the commissioner
on this one.

12:46.636 --> 12:47.970
You know what,
I hadn't thought of that.

12:48.038 --> 12:49.338
That is a really great idea.
Yeah?

12:49.406 --> 12:51.373
- I'm gonna do that.
- Okay.

12:51.441 --> 12:53.809
Your last resort is probably
gonna be city council.

12:53.877 --> 12:57.046
- Good luck there. [chuckles]
- Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

12:57.113 --> 12:59.314
I have no idea
what I was saying.

12:59.382 --> 13:00.449
I ask you,

13:00.517 --> 13:02.718
Is this too revealing
for a public pool?

13:02.786 --> 13:05.387
Kindly get your groin
off my desk.

13:05.455 --> 13:09.124
So my body makes you
uncomfortable too?

13:09.192 --> 13:11.527
Hey, mark,
I'm kind of freaking out

13:11.594 --> 13:13.429
About this historical
mansion thing.

13:13.496 --> 13:14.697
Can I talk to you for a second?

13:14.764 --> 13:16.465
I'm actually headed
right out the door.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.200
Oh, you're going on a date
with Ann?

13:18.268 --> 13:19.802
Uh, yeah, I was gonna
surprise her.

13:19.869 --> 13:21.070
Take her to a nice restaurant.

13:21.137 --> 13:22.371
- Don't worry about it.
- You sure now?

13:22.439 --> 13:24.373
Yeah. Have a good time.

13:24.441 --> 13:26.642
- How we doing?
- Pretty good.

13:26.710 --> 13:30.479
I may have promised a new
aquatic center to somebody.

13:30.547 --> 13:31.814
Is that a problem?

13:31.881 --> 13:33.782
I diagnosed two melanomas.

13:33.850 --> 13:34.850
They're both benign.

13:38.644 --> 13:40.612
April was supposed
to be the moat

13:40.679 --> 13:44.749
That kept the citizen barbarians
away from Swanson castle.

13:44.817 --> 13:48.820
Instead, she blew up the castle
and stabbed me in the face.

13:48.887 --> 13:54.058
I hired you to do one thing.
Just one.

13:54.126 --> 13:56.995
I don't care that you text
all day and sleep at your desk.

13:57.062 --> 13:58.963
In fact, I encourage it.

13:59.031 --> 14:02.133
But only because you were doing
that one thing...

14:02.201 --> 14:06.137
Keeping this crap off my desk!

14:06.205 --> 14:09.574
Give me five minutes
before the next one.

14:14.947 --> 14:16.281
That guy is scary
when he's angry.

14:16.348 --> 14:18.383
Yeah, God, I know.

14:18.450 --> 14:22.787
Hey, sorry, dude.
I don't need your sympathy.

14:22.855 --> 14:24.055
Or yours.

14:24.123 --> 14:27.692
I wasn't offering my sympathy.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.027
Thank you for meeting me here.

14:29.094 --> 14:31.429
Sure. What's up?

14:31.497 --> 14:32.897
Okay, I need you to get this
word for word.

14:32.965 --> 14:35.767
It's a tape recorder
so it will.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.236
- [dramatically] gazebo?
More like "Ga-zoinks-Bo."

14:38.304 --> 14:39.604
She may be
a former beauty queen,

14:39.672 --> 14:42.206
<i>But today she's the king
of destroying history.</i>

14:42.274 --> 14:43.941
Okay, could you just,
maybe, talk normally?

14:44.009 --> 14:46.177
- Okay, fine.
Ga-zoinks-Bo.

14:46.245 --> 14:47.879
Jessica wicks is throwing
a birthday party

14:47.946 --> 14:49.647
For her husband,
Nick Newport, Sr.,

14:49.715 --> 14:50.848
At the turnbill mansion
tonight.

14:50.916 --> 14:53.017
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

14:56.177 --> 14:57.678
So?

14:57.746 --> 14:58.846
<i>Sweetums owns
the Pawnee journal.</i>

14:58.914 --> 15:01.181
- Crrr-AP on the cob.

15:01.249 --> 15:03.517
I will take it
into consideration.

15:03.585 --> 15:07.521
Thank God!
That was it, right?

15:07.589 --> 15:09.924
- Uh, no, there's one more.
- Damn it to hell!

15:09.991 --> 15:11.592
It's with me.
And it's right now.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.028
And it's about me quitting.

15:14.095 --> 15:17.965
I quit.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.433
I have no other choice, okay?

15:19.501 --> 15:22.670
This is the only rational way
I know to prevent this tragedy.

15:22.737 --> 15:24.738
[vehicle approaching]
oh, my God. Here they come.

15:24.806 --> 15:26.407
Tom, throw away the key!
Seriously?

15:26.474 --> 15:28.943
Yes, throw it!

15:29.010 --> 15:30.277
 Out of the way!

15:30.345 --> 15:32.479
Sir, I'm sorry,
but you're a little late.

15:32.547 --> 15:34.114
You're gonna have to turn
this thing around

15:34.182 --> 15:37.418
'cause you're not getting
in here.

15:37.485 --> 15:40.788
My God. Tom, stop him!
Jump in front of it!

15:40.855 --> 15:45.025
Sacrifice your tiny body!

15:48.063 --> 15:50.197
Really thought that Gate
would open in the middle.

15:53.309 --> 15:55.176
Well, the gazebo
has been destroyed.

15:55.244 --> 15:58.613
And the thing that bothers me
the most--

15:58.681 --> 16:00.048
Cut it out, Tom.

16:00.115 --> 16:03.518
- It never gets old!
- [Sighs]

16:03.585 --> 16:05.119
Oh, hey, Ann and mark
are coming!

16:05.187 --> 16:07.388
Guys, not so close.
You're gonna--you're gonna--

16:10.548 --> 16:12.449
- Sensor.

16:12.517 --> 16:14.251
Sorry if I ruined your evening.

16:14.319 --> 16:16.854
- Leslie, it's totally fine.
- I chained myself to a Gate.

16:16.921 --> 16:18.589
- I can see that.
- Are you okay?

16:18.656 --> 16:21.925
Nothing's bruised but my ego
and my arm a little

16:21.993 --> 16:23.660
From the mechanized Gate.

16:23.728 --> 16:25.796
Thanks again for letting me
take those meetings today.

16:25.864 --> 16:28.298
I've never really had
a meeting before.

16:28.366 --> 16:30.467
They're awesome.
You're welcome.

16:30.535 --> 16:31.668
Hey, have you seen April
around?

16:31.736 --> 16:33.103
She usually comes by
at the end of the day.

16:33.171 --> 16:35.005
You might want to check
her house.

16:35.073 --> 16:36.340
She quit on me.

16:36.407 --> 16:37.975
What? Why?

16:38.042 --> 16:40.711
She screwed up
my entire life today.

16:40.778 --> 16:43.814
That was one mistake.
She's perfect for you.

16:43.882 --> 16:45.349
Come on. There's no one
in the world

16:45.416 --> 16:48.952
Who's gonna do a better job
for you than April.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.487
Either you hire her back
or I quit.

16:50.555 --> 16:53.957
- You don't work for me.
- And I never will, sir.

16:54.025 --> 16:55.392
Good day.

17:00.899 --> 17:02.866
So what'd you guys
talk about at dinner?

17:02.934 --> 17:05.669
Huh? Was it fun?
Any big decisions arrived at?

17:05.737 --> 17:08.372
- It was fine.
- Uh, do you need a ride home?

17:08.439 --> 17:11.375
No, Tom's gonna take me.
You guys go on ahead.

17:11.442 --> 17:12.976
I'm glad you're okay.
Call me tomorrow.

17:13.044 --> 17:15.444
Bye, Leslie.

17:18.950 --> 17:22.219
Well, hello there.
You must be Ron Swanson.

17:22.287 --> 17:24.054
Well, welcome
to castle Ludgate!

17:26.747 --> 17:29.349
- Larry, who is it?
- It's Zuzu's boss.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.018
Oho, Ron. Rita Ludgate.

17:32.086 --> 17:35.488
Oh, you have no idea how nice
it is to meet you.

17:35.556 --> 17:38.391
Well, oh, come in,
for gosh sake.

17:38.459 --> 17:39.559
What can I get you to drink?

17:39.627 --> 17:42.595
Ooh. Could you take
your shoes off, please?

17:42.663 --> 17:44.964
Thank you so much.

17:45.032 --> 17:46.466
Uh, nothing to drink.
Thanks.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.035
- Oh.
- Is April around?

17:49.103 --> 17:51.671
Uh, Zuzu, you have a guest!

17:51.739 --> 17:52.805
Well, I'll fetch her.

17:52.873 --> 17:55.575
She's probably
on the Internet again.

17:55.643 --> 17:57.577
- Uh, I'll come with you.
- Okay.

17:57.645 --> 17:59.746
Uh, you make yourself
at home, Mr. Swanson.

17:59.813 --> 18:04.450
Thank you.

18:04.518 --> 18:09.789
You must be April's sister.
I'm Ron.

18:13.627 --> 18:16.029
[clears throat]
nice to meet you.

18:16.096 --> 18:19.098
No offense, but I think
the normal grieving time

18:19.166 --> 18:22.368
For gazebo destruction
has passed.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.570
Yeah, well,
maybe that's not entirely

18:24.638 --> 18:27.473
What I'm upset about.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.076
Mark and Ann
are gonna get married.

18:30.144 --> 18:33.846
Really?
Why does that bother you?

18:33.914 --> 18:35.415
I should be the one
that's upset.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.351
It was supposed to be
me and Ann, or me and Jessica,

18:38.419 --> 18:42.355
Or Ann and Jessica
with me watching.

18:42.423 --> 18:44.123
Every time a couple
gets married,

18:46.883 --> 18:48.617
I'm about to lose
two good friends.

18:48.685 --> 18:49.918
Come on.

18:49.986 --> 18:53.622
They drove over here
and cut you down from a Gate.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.791
I really don't think
you have to worry about them

18:55.859 --> 18:57.660
Abandoning you
once you get married.

18:57.727 --> 19:00.062
Yeah, yeah, I know that.
In my brain.

19:00.130 --> 19:02.398
- Can we go?
- Yeah. Let's go.

19:02.465 --> 19:04.733
I just need to go
do one more thing.

19:04.801 --> 19:07.069
- Ah, come on. No! No, no, no.
- Yes.

19:07.137 --> 19:10.072
♪ loving smiles ♪

19:10.140 --> 19:15.110
♪ and smiling tears ♪

19:15.178 --> 19:18.447
♪ the midnight of my heart ♪

19:18.515 --> 19:21.550
♪ is you ♪
Okay, I'm sorry, everyone.

19:21.618 --> 19:25.287
Excuse me. Excuse me.
But I need to say something.

19:25.355 --> 19:27.456
- Is that Gate lady?
- Yes.

19:27.524 --> 19:28.924
I know you're probably thinking

19:28.992 --> 19:31.093
"there's that crazy Gate lady
from outside back again."

19:31.161 --> 19:32.461
And to some extent,
you're right.

19:32.529 --> 19:33.729
I am the Gate lady.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.030
But the only thing
I'm crazy about

19:35.098 --> 19:36.799
Is leaving the past behind.

19:36.866 --> 19:41.136
So I would like to apologize
and raise a glass

19:41.204 --> 19:45.107
To change, and forgiveness,
and the future,

19:45.175 --> 19:47.476
And Ann and mark,
and happiness,

19:47.544 --> 19:49.144
And Nick Newport, Sr.

19:49.212 --> 19:52.548
May all your future gazebos
live long and prosper.

19:52.615 --> 19:54.750
Please leave.

19:54.818 --> 19:57.252
Is it weird if I ask to take
a piece of cake with me?

19:57.320 --> 19:59.655
I won't.
Go.

19:59.723 --> 20:03.058
Why are you here?

20:03.549 --> 20:06.450
- Come back to work.
- No.

20:06.518 --> 20:10.988
Come back.
I want you to come back.

20:11.056 --> 20:14.292
Well, I don't want
to come back. The end.

20:14.359 --> 20:16.661
I was talking to Andy
about you.

20:16.728 --> 20:20.431
And he made me realize
that I need you back at work.

20:20.499 --> 20:22.767
- What did he say?
- Don't recall.

20:22.834 --> 20:26.437
- Fine. I'll come back.
- Good.

20:26.505 --> 20:29.574
Okay. I'm leaving.

20:29.641 --> 20:33.477
Bye, Zuzu.
Bye, Duke Silver.

20:37.416 --> 20:39.984
My mom has all your albums.

20:40.052 --> 20:42.019
I recognized you
the day we met.

20:42.087 --> 20:44.956
- Have you told anyone?
- No.

20:45.023 --> 20:47.858
Good girl.

20:50.580 --> 20:51.646
Excuse me.

20:51.714 --> 20:53.382
I had a meeting
with Ron Swanson yesterday,

20:53.449 --> 20:54.750
But I have a little
car trouble.

20:54.817 --> 20:56.251
Sorry, he's busy right now.

20:56.319 --> 20:58.920
Oh. Uh, well,
well, can I reschedule?

20:58.988 --> 21:04.359
Sure. Hmm.
How about June 50th?

21:04.427 --> 21:06.461
You should
come back today at 2:65?

21:06.529 --> 21:09.398
He's available then.
What is going on?

21:09.465 --> 21:10.999
Looks like the only other day
he has open

21:11.067 --> 21:12.467
Is March-tember one-teenth.

21:12.535 --> 21:17.572
Does that work, sir?
