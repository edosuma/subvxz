WEBVTT

00:29.159 --> 00:30.769
SHE'S NOT HERE.

00:30.813 --> 00:32.684
YOU STAY SHARP,
MONTOYA.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.649
PAMELA ISLEY...

00:40.692 --> 00:41.998
SHOW YOURSELF!

00:44.522 --> 00:46.089
SURRENDER, OR WE WILL
USE FORCE!

00:49.527 --> 00:51.181
I'M RIGHT HERE.

00:51.225 --> 00:54.402
STOP! PLEASE.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.534
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
DO THIS.

01:01.974 --> 01:04.803
TAKE THE SHOT,
MONTOYA.

01:12.681 --> 01:14.900
NO!

01:14.944 --> 01:19.644
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! NO!

01:19.688 --> 01:23.387
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

01:23.431 --> 01:26.129
BECAUSE SOMEONE
HAS TO CARE.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.111
FLORA & FAWNA:

01:59.597 --> 02:04.385
VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN
PULL OFF GREEN
WITH ANY SWAGGER,

02:04.428 --> 02:05.168
BUT I ACTUALLY DON'T
HATE THIS FOR YOU.

02:08.302 --> 02:11.087
AHH. YEAH. IT'S
INTERESTING.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.655
I, UM--I'M SORRY.

02:13.698 --> 02:16.179
I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A POSITION BEFORE

02:16.223 --> 02:18.616
WHERE I COULDN'T
BE HONEST BECAUSE I WAS

02:18.660 --> 02:19.835
WORRIED ABOUT HURTING
SOMEONE'S FEELINGS,
SO I'M STALLING.

02:19.878 --> 02:23.360
AW! I THINK THAT'S
THE SWEETEST THING

02:23.404 --> 02:24.318
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.191
- DID YOU ORDER MORE FOOD?
- NO.

02:30.411 --> 02:33.327
- DID YOU ORDER MORE STRIPPERS?
- UM...

02:33.370 --> 02:36.112
MS. HAMILTON,
IT'S TIME TO ASK YOU

02:36.156 --> 02:38.027
TO PACK YOUR THINGS
AND PART WAYS WITH US.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.464
UM, RUDE.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.292
YOU'VE RACKED UP
AN $8,000 BILL

02:42.336 --> 02:46.383
WITHOUT SHOWING
ANY ABILITY TO PAY FOR IT.

02:46.427 --> 02:48.037
OH! I TOLD THE LADY
AT THE DESK 10 TIMES

02:48.080 --> 02:51.606
TRY ALL MY OTHER CARDS.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.869
THEY'VE ALL BEEN DECLINED,
MS. HAMILTON.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.045
OH, ACTUALLY, IT'S
DR. HAMILTON.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.525
IT'S NOT MS.

02:57.568 --> 03:02.269
I'M AFRAID I NEED
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE,

03:02.312 --> 03:04.793
OR THE METROPOLIS PD
WILL BE ESCORTING YOU OUT.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.803
THIS IS ALL
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

03:14.846 --> 03:18.459
GIVE ME SOME TIME
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.505
PLEASE TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.594
WE'LL ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY

03:23.638 --> 03:26.206
AND A COMPLIMENTARY BOTTLE
OF DOM

03:26.249 --> 03:26.945
FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.252
YOU'RE VERY KIND, MA'AM.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.341
HA! I KNOW.

03:36.868 --> 03:39.654
DID THE BAT BITCHES
CUT ME OFF?

03:39.697 --> 03:42.265
ALL YOUR FANCY DEGREES,
AND YOU DIDN'T SEE
THAT COMING?

03:42.309 --> 03:44.267
I THOUGHT WE WERE
PAST THIS.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.051
I MEAN, ONE WOULD THINK
THAT NEARLY VINE-SQUEEZING

03:46.095 --> 03:50.317
THE LIFE OUT OF YOUR BESTIE
AND THEN CRUSHING

03:50.360 --> 03:52.144
THE ONLY CURE
FOR YOU IN EXISTENCE

03:52.188 --> 03:53.581
WAS A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR

03:53.624 --> 03:56.801
THAT IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON
FROM THE FRIENDSHIP.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.890
ANYONE ELSE FIND IT IRONIC
THAT WHEN I BEG

03:58.934 --> 04:01.415
RYAN AND LUKE
FOR THEIR ATTENTION

04:01.458 --> 04:03.199
THEY'RE TOO BUSY
WITH THEIR OWN DRAMA,

04:03.243 --> 04:04.069
BUT THEN WHEN I FINALLY
STEP AWAY

04:04.113 --> 04:06.463
FOR SOME MUCH-NEEDED
ME TIME,

04:06.507 --> 04:09.771
MARY HAMILTON IS
THE COVETED BATMISSION
OF THE WEEK?

04:09.814 --> 04:13.253
IF THIS IS A LECTURE
ON BEING BATWOMAN'S
MOST WANTED,

04:13.296 --> 04:15.255
TRUST ME, I ALREADY
TOOK THE EXAM.

04:15.298 --> 04:18.649
WELL, WHAT DO I DO?

04:18.693 --> 04:19.215
UH, YOU KILL THEM
IMMEDIATELY.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.129
ALICE.

04:22.871 --> 04:27.441
FINE. AS SOMEONE
WHO HAD A SO-CALLED
FAMILY MEMBER OBSESSED

04:27.484 --> 04:29.269
WITH THE IDEA THAT
I COULD CHANGE,

04:29.312 --> 04:32.315
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

04:32.359 --> 04:35.579
YOU MAKE YOUR FRIENDS
HATE YOU SO MUCH

04:35.623 --> 04:35.971
THAT THEY WANT TO
GIVE UP ON YOU.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.185
FLOWERS AREN'T
A FIX-ALL, PAM.

05:16.228 --> 05:19.841
MY PARTNER LOST
A KIDNEY.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.408
BUT THEY'RE
WHITE TULIPS.

05:21.451 --> 05:24.106
TECHNICALLY FROM
THE LILIACEAE FAMILY.

05:24.149 --> 05:28.632
THEY SYMBOLIZE
FORGIVENESS.

05:28.676 --> 05:29.851
WOULD YOU RATHER
IT BE A KIDNEY?

05:29.894 --> 05:33.158
HA!

05:33.202 --> 05:33.811
I'M TRYING HERE, RENEE.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.944
HE COULD HAVE DIED.

05:35.987 --> 05:36.597
HE WAS GOING TO
SHOOT ME.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.425
BECAUSE I COULDN'T.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.775
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE
HIS BACK.

05:40.818 --> 05:41.863
NO. YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE MY BACK.

05:41.906 --> 05:45.867
OHH. DON'T YOU SEE
HOW UNFAIR THAT IS?

05:45.910 --> 05:47.390
I TOOK AN OATH
TO UPHOLD THE LAW,

05:47.434 --> 05:48.826
AND YOU'RE OUT THERE
BREAKING IT CONSTANTLY

05:48.870 --> 05:51.263
FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT--
MOTHER NATURE?

05:54.615 --> 05:58.967
I KNOW GLOBAL WARMING,
WATER SHORTAGE,

05:59.010 --> 06:00.272
EXTINCTION OF SPECIES IS
AN INCONVENIENT THOUGHT FOR YOU,

06:00.316 --> 06:04.799
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THIS REUSABLE COFFEE MUG

06:04.842 --> 06:05.277
ISN'T THE SOLUTION.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.631
WHAT IS
THE SOLUTION THEN?

06:10.674 --> 06:13.590
QUITTING YOUR JOB,
OSTRACIZING OUR FRIENDS,

06:13.634 --> 06:15.418
BECOMING SO OBSESSED
TO THE POINT

06:15.462 --> 06:17.464
WHERE I DON'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE YOU?

06:18.508 --> 06:19.814
ARE YOU COMING WITH ME
OR NOT?

06:24.906 --> 06:26.603
NOT IF YOU GO WHERE
I CAN'T FOLLOW YOU.

06:26.647 --> 06:30.128
STAY HERE. STAY THE...

06:30.172 --> 06:32.783
QUIRKY, BRILLIANT
SCIENTIST WHO LOVES
READING AND BASEBALL

06:32.827 --> 06:34.176
THAT I FELL IN LOVE
WITH A DECADE AGO.

06:34.219 --> 06:38.006
SHE'S GONE.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.269
SHE'S BLOSSOMED INTO SOMEONE
WHO CAN STAND UP FOR HERSELF

06:40.312 --> 06:43.751
AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
FOR THOSE THINGS THAT CAN'T.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.812
I FROZE
MARY'S BANK ACCOUNTS.
I THINK.

07:01.856 --> 07:05.599
INTERNET'S CUT OUT 10 TIMES.

07:05.642 --> 07:06.208
AND NOW I HAVE
THE SPINNING WHEEL OF DEATH.

07:06.251 --> 07:09.385
THAT'S...AWESOME.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.648
DOES ASBESTOS
HAVE A SMELL?

07:11.692 --> 07:12.606
ANYONE SMELL THAT?

07:12.649 --> 07:14.477
DEAD RAT
IN THE WALL.

07:14.521 --> 07:15.347
GIVE IT 3 DAYS.
IT'LL PASS.

07:15.391 --> 07:16.871
WE DON'T HAVE
3 DAYS.

07:16.914 --> 07:19.177
YOU SAW HER CLINIC.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.484
IT'S COMPLETELY
OVERRUN BY PLANT LIFE.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.181
YOU DON'T FIND
THAT SYMBOLIC?

07:23.225 --> 07:24.052
WE WON'T LET HER FORGET
WHO SHE IS.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.967
OH, HOPE.
THAT'S SWEET.

07:26.010 --> 07:29.405
HOW'S THAT WORKING
OUT FOR YOU?

07:29.449 --> 07:32.408
I'M SORRY. I LEFT
MY SARCASM METER

07:32.452 --> 07:34.497
IN THE BATCAVE I NO LONGER
HAVE ACCESS TO.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.368
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WOULD LIKE TO
SAY TO ME?

07:36.412 --> 07:38.153
TAKE OFF
THE KID GLOVES, RYAN.

07:38.196 --> 07:40.242
- KID GLOVES?
- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE MARQUIS

07:40.285 --> 07:42.026
ARRESTED BECAUSE
HE'S FAMILY.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.724
YOU UNDERESTIMATED
MARY BECAUSE
SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,

07:43.767 --> 07:45.856
AND NOW YOU'RE LOCKED
OUT OF YOUR BATCAVE

07:45.900 --> 07:47.379
AND YOUR BESTIE'S
ON THE LAM

07:47.423 --> 07:49.512
WITH A SERIAL KILLER.

07:49.556 --> 07:50.644
JUMP IN IF I'M
MISSING ANYTHING.

07:50.687 --> 07:51.471
OK. WHAT THE HELL
WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,

07:51.514 --> 07:53.908
PUMMEL MARY WITH BATARANGS,

07:53.951 --> 07:55.300
LET THEM THROW MARQUIS
IN ARKHAM FOR A BRAIN INJURY

07:55.344 --> 07:57.607
THAT ISN'T HIS FAULT?

07:57.651 --> 07:59.783
IT'S CALLED MAKING
HARD CHOICES.

07:59.827 --> 08:00.697
WHY ARE WE EVEN HERE?
THERE WASN'T A TOXIC SEWER

08:00.741 --> 08:02.960
WITH WI-FI ACCESS?

08:03.004 --> 08:05.920
RENEE'S NOT WRONG, RYAN.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.922
WE NEED A HARDER STANCE.

08:07.965 --> 08:08.662
BY AGREEING
WITH THE WOMAN

08:08.705 --> 08:10.925
WHO'S BLACKMAILING ME

08:10.968 --> 08:12.796
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SLEEPING WITH HER?

08:12.840 --> 08:15.059
AHEM. WOW.
UM, I THINK I SMELL
THAT ASBESTOS.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.321
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO
GET SOME AIR.

08:16.365 --> 08:19.150
LOOK. I GET IT.
MARY'S YOUR FRIEND.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.325
I THOUGHT I COULD PLEAD
AND HOPE

08:20.369 --> 08:21.675
AND RATIONALIZE
WITH PAM, TOO.

08:21.718 --> 08:24.460
IT DIDN'T WORK.
EVENTUALLY, IT GOT TO THE POINT

08:24.504 --> 08:25.548
WHERE SHE MADE ME CHOOSE--

08:25.592 --> 08:26.854
MY OBLIGATION
TO THE CITY OR HER.

08:26.897 --> 08:29.117
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?

08:30.553 --> 08:34.383
SOMETHING PAM WILL NEVER
FORGIVE ME FOR.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.732
I SOLD MY SOUL
TO BATMAN.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.952
HE KNEW HE COULDN'T
TRUST ARKHAM TO CONTAIN HER,

08:37.995 --> 08:39.562
SO HE DEVELOPED
A DESICCATION SERUM

08:39.606 --> 08:41.738
THAT MIMICKED THE PROCESS
A PLANT GOES THROUGH

08:41.782 --> 08:43.479
WHEN IT'S DENIED
WATER OR SUNLIGHT.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.699
THE DEVICE USED
TO INJECT IT

08:45.742 --> 08:46.830
IS CODED TO THE SERUM,
MEANING IT'S ALSO

08:46.874 --> 08:48.353
THE ONLY WAY
TO EXTRACT IT FROM HER.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.791
SO IF WE GOT
MORE OF THE SERUM,

08:50.834 --> 08:51.443
WE COULD USE IT
ON MARY?

08:51.487 --> 08:53.402
I HAVE THE DEVICE,

08:53.445 --> 08:55.622
BUT HE ONLY MADE
ONE DOSE OF SERUM.

08:55.665 --> 08:56.361
IT'S CURRENTLY
PUMPING THROUGH

08:56.405 --> 08:58.015
PAMELA'S BLOODSTREAM.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.321
- SO WHERE IS SHE?
- NO ONE KNOWS.

08:59.364 --> 09:00.888
OK, BUT IF WE
FIND HER,

09:00.931 --> 09:02.019
THEN PRESUMABLY
WE COULD SIPHON THE SERUM

09:02.063 --> 09:05.240
AND USE IT TO STOP
MARY, RIGHT?

09:05.283 --> 09:07.068
WRONG! FIRST OF ALL,
ACCIDENTALLY UNLEASHING

09:07.111 --> 09:10.854
AN ECOTERRORIST
WOULD NOT BE
A GOOD LOOK FOR US.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.377
SECOND, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT DESICCATION MEANS?

09:12.421 --> 09:15.076
WE WOULD BE
DEHYDRATING MARY
TO THE BRINK OF DEATH.

09:15.119 --> 09:17.078
NO. THE SERUM
WAS JUST TO PUT PAM DOWN,

09:17.121 --> 09:19.646
AND THAT WAS 10 YEARS AGO.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.865
IF WE REMOVE IT,
MY GUESS IS SHE STAYS DORMANT

09:21.909 --> 09:23.258
UNLESS SHE COMES INTO CONTACT
WITH SUNLIGHT OR WATER.

09:23.301 --> 09:27.218
AS FOR POINT NUMBER TWO,
KID GLOVES, RYAN.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.525
DID YOU HEAR WHAT
RENEE JUST SAID?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.179
PAM WILL NEVER
FORGIVE HER FOR WHAT
SHE DID TO HER.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.050
WE ARE NOT PUTTING
MARY THROUGH THAT
SAME TORTURE

09:33.094 --> 09:34.704
SO SHE CAN HATE
US, TOO.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.663
THIS COULD BE
OUR ONLY CHANCE TO SAVE MARY.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.539
THE TRUE MARY WOULD WANT
US TO STOP HER

09:43.583 --> 09:45.106
BEFORE SHE CAN DO SOMETHING
THAT SHE CAN'T TAKE BACK.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.281
WE CANNOT HELP HER
UNLESS WE STOP HER.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.724
FINE.

09:58.728 --> 09:59.947
IF I WERE BATMAN,

09:59.990 --> 10:03.820
WHERE WOULD I STASH
POISON IVY?

10:03.864 --> 10:05.387
OUR BEST BET IS THAT
BRUCE WROTE ABOUT PAM ISLEY

10:05.430 --> 10:07.432
IN HIS JOURNALS,
WHICH ARE IN THE BATCAVE HERE,

10:07.476 --> 10:09.652
BUT MARQUIS'
STATE-OF-THE-ART INTERIOR

10:09.696 --> 10:10.697
AND EXTERIOR CAMERAS MEANS

10:10.740 --> 10:13.090
NO ROOF, BALCONY,
OR GARAGE ACCESS.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.004
CAN YOU HACK INTO THE FEED
AND BUY ME SOME TIME?

10:14.048 --> 10:16.441
- NOT WITH DIALUP.
- MANPOWER?

10:16.485 --> 10:18.008
THERE'S 5
SECURITY GUARDS
PER FLOOR.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.619
- DIGITAL UPGRADES?
- ACCORDING TO OUR FORMER STAFF,

10:19.662 --> 10:22.534
EVERY EXECUTIVE ELEVATOR
REQUIRES A THUMB SCAN,

10:22.578 --> 10:24.101
AND HIS OFFICE IS LOCKED
WITH A RETINAL SCAN.

10:24.145 --> 10:25.276
GUYS, WE'RE NOT
GETTING INTO THIS BUILDING.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.281
WHY IS MARQUIS CALLING ME?
AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIS?

10:30.325 --> 10:32.066
WHAT THE HELL
DOES HE WANT?

10:32.109 --> 10:35.243
GUESS I'M ABOUT TO
FIND OUT.

10:35.286 --> 10:38.594
I'M SORRY. I WAS
A DETECTIVE FOR 8 YEARS,

10:38.638 --> 10:40.727
AND I'M JUST LEARNING NOW
THAT...

10:40.770 --> 10:44.556
BRUCE WAYNE WAS...BATMAN?

10:44.600 --> 10:47.081
WHAT UP, SIS?
QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.909
IS THIS THING LEGIT?

10:48.952 --> 10:49.866
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I CAN HAWK IT FOR,

10:49.910 --> 10:52.042
A BUCK 50, TWO?

10:52.086 --> 10:54.131
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
MARQUIS?

10:54.175 --> 10:56.873
I'M REDECORATING
MY OFFICE.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.309
YOU DO KNOW YOU HAD
A CHESS SET, RIGHT?

10:58.353 --> 11:00.355
YOU SHOULD BE
IN JAIL.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.878
OH! SAMESIES, SIS.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.488
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
HAD ME KIDNAPPED?

11:03.532 --> 11:05.708
THAT'S ILLEGAL!
TSK, TSK, TSK.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.928
YOU WANT TO CALL IT SIXES
AND MOVE ON?

11:07.971 --> 11:09.712
YOU NEED HELP.
YOU NEED A DOCTOR.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.453
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.716
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
- SIR.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.891
THE PLANNER'S UPSTAIRS
READY TO TAKE YOU

11:14.935 --> 11:16.284
THROUGH THE STAGING
FOR THE PARTY TONIGHT,

11:16.327 --> 11:17.459
AND YOUR MASK IS HERE
FOR A FITTING.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.417
YEAH. TWO SECONDS.

11:19.461 --> 11:20.027
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
YOU WERE CALLING ME

11:20.070 --> 11:22.290
A MENTAL CASE.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.292
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
CALLED ME

11:24.335 --> 11:25.336
IF A TINY PART OF YOU
WASN'T REACHING
OUT FOR HELP.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.599
JUST LIKE THERE'S
A TINY PART OF YOU

11:27.643 --> 11:28.339
THAT LOVES ME, RIGHT,
OR ELSE YOU WOULD HAVE HAD

11:28.383 --> 11:29.079
MY ASS THROWN IN ARKHAM,

11:29.123 --> 11:30.907
AND BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME,

11:30.951 --> 11:33.344
YOU TRIED TO TURN ME
INTO AN ICE CUBE.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.738
ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED TO
SAY THANK YOU.

11:35.782 --> 11:39.394
THE COLD,
THE NEAR DEATH OF IT ALL,

11:39.437 --> 11:41.004
GOT TO SAY,
IT AWOKE SOMETHING IN ME

11:41.048 --> 11:44.181
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER FELT
THIS ALIVE.

11:44.225 --> 11:47.010
MARQUIS JET IS COMING
FOR YOU, GOTHAM!

11:50.187 --> 11:50.840
YOU'LL BE HEARING
FROM ME SOON.

12:00.023 --> 12:03.113
WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT?

12:03.157 --> 12:05.725
I THINK MARQUIS IS
THROWING A PARTY
AT WAYNE TONIGHT,

12:05.768 --> 12:06.856
AND WE'RE GONNA
CRASH IT.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.460
SO WE SHOULD RUN
OUR IDENTITIES. GO.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.679
AHEM. HELLO.
I'M SPENCER GLAD,

12:47.723 --> 12:50.291
FORMER OLYMPIC ATHLETE,
RUMORED TO BE

12:50.334 --> 12:52.467
THE NEXT OWNER
OF THE GOTHAM KNIGHTS.

12:52.510 --> 12:55.296
I'LL HIT YOU UP
FOR FLOOR SEATS, SPENCE.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.601
THE NAME'S
CECELIA LANGLEY,

12:56.645 --> 12:59.517
HEIRESS TO A WHISKEY FORTUNE
AND WORLD TRAVELER.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.827
PENELOPE DEVEREAUX,
WHO FOR SOME REASON

13:04.871 --> 13:07.482
RUNS A BOARD GAME
EMPIRE?

13:07.525 --> 13:08.439
- HONESTLY, DREAM JOB.
- JUST GONNA SAY IT.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.137
MY GIRL SOUNDS HOT.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.443
ALSO, HOW ARE WE NOT
GONNA RUN INTO THESE
PEOPLE TONIGHT?

13:12.487 --> 13:14.837
YEAH. I SENT SOME E-MAILS.
THEY THINK THEY'RE UNINVITED,

13:14.881 --> 13:17.492
AND, YES, SHE IS.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.146
I FITTED YOUR MASK
WITH OCULAR MESH SCANNERS

13:19.189 --> 13:20.800
FROM THE BATSUIT.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.323
BE CAREFUL.
SOPHIE, YOURS IS

13:22.366 --> 13:23.498
FROM THE DOLLAR STORE.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.630
- GO NUTS.
- OK. SO WE GET IN,

13:25.674 --> 13:26.806
GET PAST SECURITY,
GET TO THE BATCAVE,

13:26.849 --> 13:29.591
FIND BRUCE'S JOURNALS,
AND FIND PAM.

13:32.028 --> 13:34.901
OH, AND, PENELOPE,
YOU'RE FRENCH.

13:34.944 --> 13:35.684
WAIT. WHAT?

13:51.047 --> 13:55.008
8 OF CLUBS?
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

13:55.051 --> 13:56.966
HOPEFULLY WE'LL
BE LONG GONE
BEFORE IT MATTERS.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.272
MARQUIS, ON P.A.:
WHO WANTS TO PLAY A GAME?

14:06.019 --> 14:10.284
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE IN LIFE
THAN A FAKE SMILE.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.424
A COUPLE DAYS AGO,
I SAT DOWN

14:20.468 --> 14:22.687
AT THE TABLE
OF MY BRAND-NEW BOARD ROOM,

14:22.731 --> 14:25.299
SURROUNDED BY MEN AND WOMEN
WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

14:25.342 --> 14:26.604
MY SOLDIERS,

14:26.648 --> 14:30.260
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT
I WASN'T THE RIGHT MAN

14:30.304 --> 14:31.740
TO LEAD WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.350
ON YOUR RIGHT.

14:33.394 --> 14:34.874
OH, OH, MAN. OH.
I'M SO SORRY.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.354
HI. I'LL TAKE
THIS FOR YOU.

14:37.398 --> 14:38.399
BUT IT WAS THE WAY
THAT THEY SAID IT.

14:38.442 --> 14:39.922
NO CRACK OR ANYTHING.
THAT'S CRAZY.

14:39.966 --> 14:44.057
SO CONDESCENDING,
LIKE THEY WERE MAD ABOUT IT,

14:44.100 --> 14:45.188
LIKE THIS.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.584
SO I FIRED THEIR ASSES!

14:52.630 --> 14:56.591
EACH OF YOU HAS PROVEN
TO BE OF SAVAGE MIND.

14:56.634 --> 14:59.942
THAT'S WHO I WANT
AT MY WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.083
JACK OF HEARTS.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.214
DID WE JUST CRASH
A DERANGED GROUP
JOB INTERVIEW?

15:11.258 --> 15:12.955
I'M AFRAID SO.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.049
HANDS ON THE TABLE,
JACK OF HEARTS.

15:22.747 --> 15:23.661
TRUE OR FALSE--

15:23.705 --> 15:26.273
WHEN WE CLIMB
TO THE TOP,

15:26.316 --> 15:28.014
WE GOT TO BE WILLING
TO GET A LITTLE CRAZY.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.972
TRUE.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.933
HOW'S THIS?
CLOSE ENOUGH?

15:33.976 --> 15:35.717
NO. WE NEED
A FULL RETINAL MAP
TO FOOL THE SCANNERS.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.414
YOU NEED TO BE A LOT CLOSER.

15:37.458 --> 15:38.502
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT

15:38.546 --> 15:40.635
WHILE HE'S PLAYING
GAME SHOW HOST?

15:40.678 --> 15:41.766
LOOK. ALL I KNOW IS
I SWITCHED THE SIM CARD

15:41.810 --> 15:43.420
ON HIS ASSISTANT'S TABLET,
AND NOW I HAVE

15:43.464 --> 15:44.465
FULL ACCESS
TO TOWER SECURITY CAMS.

15:44.508 --> 15:47.337
OK. AHEM.
IT'S NOT A COMPETITION.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.603
YEAH. SURE THING,
BUT, UH, SOPHIE JUST GOT

15:52.647 --> 15:55.041
MARQUIS' THUMBPRINT,
SO KIND OF JUST
WAITING ON YOU HERE.

15:57.826 --> 15:58.740
COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.569
THE SICK AMONG US
DESERVE OUR...

16:02.700 --> 16:04.702
PITY?

16:07.357 --> 16:07.879
HA HA HA!

16:09.838 --> 16:15.235
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

16:15.278 --> 16:18.064
THE ANSWER WE WERE
LOOKING FOR WAS FEAR.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.980
TOUGH LUCK.

16:21.023 --> 16:21.676
WHO'S NEXT?

16:25.027 --> 16:27.116
COME ON. DON'T BE SHY.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.553
LOOK. I PROMISE THIS IS
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.992
3 OF DIAMONDS.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.961
OUI. C'EST MOI.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.095
OH.
MISS PENELOPE DEVEREAUX

16:49.138 --> 16:51.749
I PRESUME.

16:51.793 --> 16:52.968
OK. HERE WE GO.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.970
THE ONLY PARISIAN
ON MY GUEST LIST.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.494
YOU CREATED THE GAME
3 MURDERS AT THE BOWERY.

16:57.538 --> 17:02.064
MAY I SAY YOUR WORK
IS MOST...

17:02.108 --> 17:02.586
THOUGHTFULLY DERANGED.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.632
MERCI.

17:04.675 --> 17:08.157
JUST--JUST
A FEW MORE SECONDS.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.115
TRUE OR FALSE--

17:09.158 --> 17:11.639
AN ARTIST ALWAYS PUTS
HERSELF,

17:11.682 --> 17:15.077
NO MATTER HOW DARK,
INTO HER WORK.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.339
OUI.

17:18.428 --> 17:22.084
WHENEVER WE REVEAL
OUR DARKNESS INTO THE LIGHT.

17:22.128 --> 17:22.650
WE ARE NO LONGER SCARED.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.086
NON.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.262
HEH.

17:26.306 --> 17:29.135
FINISH THIS SENTENCE.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.311
A MOTHER'S LOVE IS...

17:31.354 --> 17:32.573
SCAN COMPLETE.
GOOD TO GO.

17:34.749 --> 17:37.404
EH, NOT MY PROBLEM.

17:53.637 --> 17:55.248
YOU KNOW, IF MY
THERAPIST WERE HERE,

17:55.291 --> 17:57.424
SHE'D SAY IT'S NEVER
A GOOD IDEA

17:57.467 --> 17:59.643
TO HUNT A DESICCATED BODY
WHILE ANGRY.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.167
JUST TELL ME WHY
SHE WANTS TO BE HERE
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.343
IT'S NOT ALL
OF A SUDDEN.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.474
WE WERE PLANNING
TO SPEND OUR ENTIRE
LIVES TOGETHER.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.998
BRUCE MENTIONED
ANYTHING ABOUT PAM,

18:07.042 --> 18:10.089
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
I'LL UNDERSTAND IT.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.178
JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
KISS AND MAKE UP WITH HER

18:12.221 --> 18:13.048
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GOOD.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.571
I GET WHY
YOU'RE PISSED,

18:14.615 --> 18:16.617
BUT REMEMBER
SOMETHING.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.228
POISON IVY COST ME
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.099
TRYING TO HELP.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.712
I'LL TAKE YOUR HELP.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.931
THEN I WANT MY NAME--

18:26.975 --> 18:29.325
BATWOMAN'S NAME--
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.545
WE'VE PRETTY MUCH
CLEANED UP EVERYTHING
ON YOUR LIST.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.677
THAT'S A FUN WAY
OF SAYING THE JOKER'S
JOY BUZZER'S

18:33.721 --> 18:34.591
STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.332
OK. WE NEED ALICE
TO FIND IT.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.118
WAIT. ALICE WAS
YOUR JOB, RIGHT?

18:39.161 --> 18:40.467
AND YOU WERE HOOKING UP
WITH HER AT HER PLACE,

18:40.510 --> 18:42.991
WHICH--PHEW--I HOPE
IT'S NICER THAN HER OFFICE.

18:43.034 --> 18:43.731
MY PLACE IS
RENT CONTROLLED.

18:43.774 --> 18:46.821
WHO CARES IF
IT'S NICE?

18:46.864 --> 18:47.952
REALLY THOUGHT WAYNE TOWER
WAS TALL ENOUGH

18:47.996 --> 18:49.084
FOR US TO GET
TO HANDSHAKES, LADIES.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.758
HI. HEY. I THOUGHT
I TOLD YOU TO LOCK
THE DOOR.

19:13.543 --> 19:13.587
EHH.

19:18.592 --> 19:19.636
UHH!

19:26.556 --> 19:27.557
WE'RE THE CLEANING LADIES.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.130
LET'S GO.

19:57.457 --> 19:58.109
SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.

20:07.423 --> 20:08.772
CAN YOU FACE
THE OTHER WAY?

20:08.816 --> 20:11.340
WE KIND OF GOT
A HIDDEN ENTRY
SITUATION GOING HERE.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.158
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.645
GUYS, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU FIGURED OUT

20:55.689 --> 20:57.125
WHERE POISON IVY'S BURIED.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.082
- WE JUST GOT TO THE JOURNALS.
- BE QUICK ABOUT IT

20:58.126 --> 20:59.780
BECAUSE MARY JUST GOT HERE.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.565
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21:02.609 --> 21:04.306
MARY CAME HOME.
IS SHE LOOKING FOR US?

21:04.350 --> 21:05.612
UH, JUST JUDGING
A BOOK BY ITS COVER HERE,

21:05.655 --> 21:06.787
BUT I THINK IT'S
MORE LIKELY
THAT SHE'S LOOKING

21:06.830 --> 21:07.788
FOR FREAK FERTILIZER.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.356
ANY SIGN
OF ALICE WITH HER?

21:10.399 --> 21:11.357
NO, NOT YET,
BUT I'LL KEEP MY EYE
ON THE SECURITY CAMS.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.750
DON'T LET HER
LEAVE THIS BUILDING.

21:13.794 --> 21:14.490
GREAT. I MEAN, SHE'S
BEEN SO COOPERATIVE LATELY,

21:14.534 --> 21:16.275
I SEE NO PROBLEMS THERE.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.364
OK. CALL IF YOU
NEED BACKUP.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.539
IF MARY'S HERE,
IT'S FOR A REASON,

21:19.582 --> 21:22.933
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU
IT'S NOT TO DANCE.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.108
LET'S JUST GET
TO THESE.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.858
OK. I PROMISE I JUST
WANT TO TALK.

21:34.902 --> 21:37.165
OK. I'LL JUST GRAB
A NUMBER AND STAY RIGHT HERE.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.692
MARY HAMILTON.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.694
WELL, WELL.
I SHOULD PROBABLY

21:44.738 --> 21:47.741
FIRE MY PUBLICIST,
MARY HAMILTON,

21:47.784 --> 21:51.397
BECAUSE YOU SHOULD
KNOW YOUR FRIENDS
NO LONGER LIVE HERE.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.095
WELL, I'M NO PR REP,
BUT IF SHE'S THE ONE

21:54.138 --> 21:56.445
WHO CAME UP WITH YOUR
DECK OF CARDS THEME,

21:56.489 --> 21:58.273
IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.929
HEH. I'M NOT FEELING
THE VIBES YOU'RE
PUTTING OUT,

22:01.972 --> 22:05.411
AND THAT'S A SHAME
BECAUSE YOU...

22:05.454 --> 22:08.370
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'D
BE A LOT OF FUN.

22:08.414 --> 22:12.331
DON'T GIVE UP ON ME
SO FAST, MR. C-E-BRO.

22:12.374 --> 22:15.551
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD
THE REASON I CAME ALL
THIS WAY TO FIND YOU.

22:15.595 --> 22:18.206
DANCE?

22:24.691 --> 22:27.824
OK. OK. OK, OK,
OK, OK, OK, OK.

22:27.868 --> 22:30.000
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

22:31.959 --> 22:34.570
NEW PLAN. BRUCE
ARCHIVED THESE
CHRONOLOGICALLY,

22:34.614 --> 22:38.095
SO LET'S START THERE.

22:38.139 --> 22:38.879
WHEN WAS THE FIRST
TIME YOU CONTACTED
BATMAN FOR HELP?

22:38.922 --> 22:39.488
IT WAS EARLY JUNE 2011.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.229
OK.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.932
DOES ANY OF THIS
LOOK FAMILIAR?

22:48.976 --> 22:52.980
THIS. THIS IS
THE GOTHAM CITY DAM.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.590
BRUCE WOULDN'T HAVE
DESICCATED PAM
AROUND THAT MUCH WATER.

22:54.634 --> 22:57.811
HE DIDN'T. HE NEEDED TO
STOP HER FROM DESTROYING IT.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.116
THE DAM WAS
HER NEXT TARGET.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.902
OK, OK. I'M--I'M SORRY.

23:01.945 --> 23:04.339
WHY DID YOU LOVE
THIS WOMAN?

23:04.383 --> 23:07.211
BECAUSE THROUGH IT ALL
I KNEW IT REALLY WASN'T HER.

23:07.255 --> 23:11.302
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MARY,
WHAT HAPPENED TO PAM

23:11.346 --> 23:12.347
WASN'T A FAIR FIGHT.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.407
I APPRECIATE
THE SYMBOLISM,

23:28.450 --> 23:31.279
BUT TECHNICALLY,
YOU JUST KILLED A TULIP.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.236
YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

23:32.280 --> 23:34.978
YES, I AM.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.416
THE QUESTION IS
DO I PACK

23:37.459 --> 23:41.594
ONE TOOTHBRUSH OR TWO?

23:41.637 --> 23:42.812
GUYS AT THE PRECINCT
MENTIONED SOMETHING

23:42.856 --> 23:46.816
ABOUT A BREAK-IN
AT GOTHAM DAM
LAST NIGHT.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.383
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT,
WOULD YOU?

23:51.038 --> 23:52.561
I HAVEN'T BEEN
STUDYING MY ASS OFF

23:52.605 --> 23:56.043
FOR MY DETECTIVE'S EXAM
FOR NOTHING.

23:56.086 --> 23:56.609
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
TO DO THERE?

24:01.570 --> 24:02.963
YOU WANT THE TRUTH
SO YOU HAVE TO
BREAK UP WITH ME

24:03.006 --> 24:04.486
OR A LIE SO WE CAN
STAY TOGETHER?

24:04.530 --> 24:06.923
DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T PUT THIS ON ME.

24:06.967 --> 24:09.709
WHY NOT? YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

24:09.752 --> 24:12.668
I WANT TO SAVE GOTHAM
FROM BECOMING

24:12.712 --> 24:14.235
A TOXIC WASTE DUMP,
AND I'D LIKE YOU
TO SUPPORT ME

24:14.278 --> 24:15.410
WHILE I DO IT,

24:15.454 --> 24:16.977
SO...

24:17.020 --> 24:20.894
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

24:23.462 --> 24:26.856
FOR YOU TO
CHOOSE ONE--

24:26.900 --> 24:28.554
YOUR CAUSE,
FLOODING THE CITY,

24:28.597 --> 24:32.688
WIPING FULL NEIGHBORHOODS
OFF THE MAP, OR ME.

24:39.260 --> 24:43.699
ABOVE ALL ELSE,
I WANT YOU.

24:45.832 --> 24:48.835
BUT I NEED YOU TO TRUST THAT
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.640
WHAT IS THIS FOR?

25:11.684 --> 25:13.163
FORGIVENESS.

25:19.169 --> 25:19.605
OHH!

25:42.628 --> 25:43.411
YOU THINK
OF SOMETHING?

25:47.154 --> 25:48.503
YOU GOOD?

25:52.899 --> 25:54.465
HEY.
GOT SOMETHING.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.642
BRUCE WROTE THAT
POISON IVY WOULD
HAVE TO BE KEPT

25:56.685 --> 25:57.947
WHERE NO ONE
WOULD LOOK FOR HER

25:57.991 --> 25:59.601
BUT SOMEWHERE HE
COULD GET TO HER
IF HE NEEDED.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.038
SO CLOSE. HE WOULDN'T
HAVE BURIED HER ANYWHERE

26:02.082 --> 26:03.431
NEAR THEIR USUAL
HOT SPOTS--

26:03.474 --> 26:06.303
DOCKS, SHIPYARDS,
BACK ALLEYS.

26:06.347 --> 26:07.435
NO. IT'D HAVE TO BE
DARK AND DRY,

26:07.478 --> 26:08.610
NO WATER, NO LIGHT,
NO OTHER PLANT LIFE.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.438
WATER WAS
HIS BIGGEST CONCERN.

26:10.481 --> 26:13.093
A SINGLE DROP COULD BE
ENOUGH TO REANIMATE HER.

26:13.136 --> 26:14.703
GOTHAM CITY IS
A DAMN ISLAND,

26:14.747 --> 26:17.924
WHERE IT RAINS
300 DAYS A YEAR.

26:17.967 --> 26:19.273
ARE YOU SURE HE
DIDN'T MAKE A DEAL
WITH GCPD

26:19.316 --> 26:20.927
FOR SOME KIND OF
SPECIAL PROTECTIVE
CUSTODY?

26:20.970 --> 26:23.625
WELL, SHE'S NOT
AT BLACKGATE,

26:23.669 --> 26:24.844
AND I CHECKED
THE OFF-BOOKS WING
AT ARKHAM, TOO.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.193
THERE HAS TO BE AN ANSWER
WE'RE NOT SEEING.

26:31.938 --> 26:34.462
OH, MY GOD.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.434
WHAT IF SHE'S HERE?

27:03.186 --> 27:05.580
YOU SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE
IN SERVICE

27:05.624 --> 27:07.974
TO LOGIC
AND FORENSIC EVIDENCE,

27:08.017 --> 27:10.672
AND THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT LOVE DOES.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.370
IT MAKES YOU WANT TO SAY
THINGS LIKE,

27:13.414 --> 27:15.677
"I KNOW SHE'S DOWN HERE.

27:15.721 --> 27:16.852
I CAN FEEL HER."

27:22.597 --> 27:23.467
IF SHE'S IN THERE,
ARE YOU SURE

27:23.511 --> 27:26.427
YOU WANT TO SEE HER
LIKE THIS?

27:26.470 --> 27:29.691
RYAN AND I CAN
HANDLE IT.

27:29.735 --> 27:33.216
THANKS, BUT I OWE
IT TO HER NOT TO
RUN AWAY AND HIDE.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.218
THIS HAS THE SCHEMATICS
FOR THE TUNNEL SYSTEM

27:35.262 --> 27:37.220
BELOW THE BATCAVE.

27:37.264 --> 27:38.787
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE
GONNA END UP,

27:38.831 --> 27:41.529
SO MAKE SURE WE FIND
OUR WAY BACK.

27:41.572 --> 27:45.054
HOW FAR DOWN
DOES THIS GO?

27:45.098 --> 27:46.316
EVEN CLOSER TO HELL
THAN YOUR OFFICE.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.230
OK. I NEED TOTAL QUIET.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.807
SORRY, GUYS.
DAMN FRAUD ALERT
ON MY CREDIT CARD.

27:58.851 --> 28:01.331
Y--SILENCING.

28:19.045 --> 28:22.831
I THINK I GOT SOMETHING.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.006
TRYING TO ISOLATE IT.

28:30.273 --> 28:34.060
OK. I'M LOCKED IN.

28:34.103 --> 28:37.019
I CAN HEAR IT CLEAR ENOUGH
TO TRACK THE SOURCE.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.804
HEAR WHAT?

28:38.847 --> 28:42.024
- PAM'S HEARTBEAT.
- OH, MY GOD.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.243
- YOU HAVE THE DEVICE?
- YEAH.

28:43.286 --> 28:45.549
THEN WE NEED TO MOVE.
WHATEVER MARY'S UP TO,

28:45.593 --> 28:47.508
SHE DOESN'T STAY
IN ONE PLACE FOR LONG.

28:47.551 --> 28:48.901
LUKE, WE THINK PAM'S
SOMEWHERE

28:48.944 --> 28:51.164
IN THE LOWER TUNNELS.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.557
AH. THAT IS
ACTUALLY BRILLIANT.

28:53.601 --> 28:54.341
A LOT OF SOLID ROCK
DOWN THERE,

28:54.384 --> 28:55.516
SO WE MIGHT LOSE CONTACT.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.605
KEEP MARY THERE.
HELP IS ON THE WAY.

28:57.648 --> 28:58.345
LET'S GO.

29:07.397 --> 29:10.096
SO I KEEP
WONDERING TWO THINGS.

29:10.139 --> 29:13.795
WHY ARE YOU HERE,
AND WHERE'S WILDER?

29:13.839 --> 29:16.929
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY THINKING
ABOUT YOUR SISTER RIGHT NOW?

29:16.972 --> 29:21.281
SO YOU EXPECT ME
TO THINK THAT I COULD
STEAL HER COMPANY...

29:21.324 --> 29:23.500
AND SHE'S JUST
COOL WITH IT?

29:23.544 --> 29:25.415
HMM. IT'S HONESTLY
KIND OF ANNOYING

29:25.459 --> 29:28.679
HOW MUCH CLINGINESS RUNS
IN YOUR FAMILY.

29:28.723 --> 29:31.334
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
RYAN ISN'T PAYING
ATTENTION TO YOU?

29:31.378 --> 29:33.989
IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S
TOO OBSESSED
WITH FIXING ME.

29:37.645 --> 29:39.560
YOU DON'T LOOK
BROKEN TO ME.

29:39.603 --> 29:41.083
LOOK.

29:41.127 --> 29:43.172
LONG STORY SHORT,

29:43.216 --> 29:45.653
I JUST WANT TO MOVE ON
WITH MY LIFE

29:45.696 --> 29:46.785
WITH THE ONE PERSON LEFT
WHO UNDERSTANDS ME.

29:46.828 --> 29:49.091
UNH.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.702
BUT THEN I THOUGHT
TO MYSELF

29:51.746 --> 29:55.837
THIS MARQUIS GUY HAS
A LOT OF WEIRD BAGGAGE.

29:55.881 --> 29:59.449
MAYBE HE WANTS TO TAKE
REVENGE ON RYAN ON MY BEHALF.

29:59.493 --> 30:00.581
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
IN MIND?

30:15.161 --> 30:18.294
OOP. WELL, LOOK
WHO STOPPED TALKING.

30:18.338 --> 30:22.429
UM, A LITTLE BONUS
FOR YOU.

30:22.472 --> 30:27.651
IT MIGHT HELP OPEN UP
SOME DOORS FOR YOU
IN THE FUTURE.

30:27.695 --> 30:28.827
HEH HEH HEH.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.229
RYAN, ARE WE
HOT OR COLD?

30:40.273 --> 30:42.841
TELL ME WE'RE SCALDING

30:42.884 --> 30:44.886
BECAUSE WE'RE ALMOST
AT THE END OF THE MAP.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.235
WELL, IT'S GETTING LOUDER.
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH FURTHER.

30:48.020 --> 30:48.890
- AGH!
- BATWOMAN...

30:48.934 --> 30:50.370
- MARY AND MARQUIS...
- LUKE?

30:50.413 --> 30:53.503
LUKE, YOU COPY? DAMN.

30:53.547 --> 30:54.896
OK. THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH MARY UPSTAIRS.

30:54.940 --> 30:55.636
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

30:55.679 --> 30:56.115
GUYS!

31:27.755 --> 31:29.626
TELL ME SHE HAD
A CHARMING PERSONALITY.

31:29.670 --> 31:30.758
THAT'S
THE DESICCATION.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.194
THE SERUM LEECHES WATER
FROM THE CELLS.

31:32.238 --> 31:32.934
INCLUDES SKIN AND TISSUE.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.766
YOU WANT TO DO
THIS TO MARY?

31:38.809 --> 31:40.202
I'M TRYING TO PREVENT
A POISON IVY OUTBREAK

31:40.246 --> 31:42.030
FROM WIPING OUT GOTHAM'S
BEST AND BRIGHTEST UPSTAIRS.

31:42.074 --> 31:45.947
LOOK, RYAN.
I WAS YOU ONCE.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.341
I WANTED TO BELIEVE
THAT THERE WAS SOME
MAGICAL SOLUTION

31:48.384 --> 31:49.255
WHERE I SAVED
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE

31:49.298 --> 31:51.344
WITHOUT HER HATING ME
FOREVER.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.041
THERE ISN'T.
MARY IS AT THE PARTY.

31:53.085 --> 31:55.391
THE SERUM IS HERE.

31:56.305 --> 31:57.089
IT'S TIME TO STEP UP.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.720
ALL RIGHT. GOT IT.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.243
HEY, LUKE. IF YOU CAN
HEAR ME, I'M HEADED UP.

32:21.287 --> 32:22.418
- WE'RE COMING WITH YOU.
- STAY AND MAKE SURE

32:22.462 --> 32:24.464
PAM DOESN'T WAKE UP.

32:24.507 --> 32:25.291
I'LL CHECK IN
ONCE MARY'S DOWN.

32:25.334 --> 32:28.511
REMEMBER,
NO WATER BREAKS,

32:28.555 --> 32:29.121
AND IF YOU SO MUCH AS
HAVE TO SNEEZE, DON'T.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.129
JUST IN CASE.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.224
HEY. BATWOMAN, IF YOU COPY,
I LOST EYES ON MARY.

32:45.267 --> 32:48.531
WHERE ARE YOU?

32:48.575 --> 32:50.403
- DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE COMING.
- GET THE HELL OFF ME, MAN.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.057
OH, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE
TALKING LIKE THAT.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.232
YOU'RE NOT WEARING
THE RIGHT COSTUME.

32:53.275 --> 32:55.495
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:55.538 --> 32:56.452
SEE, I JUST WONDER
WHERE YOU KEEP IT.

32:56.496 --> 32:58.367
PLUG IT IN LIKE
A TESLA CHARGER?

32:58.411 --> 33:00.413
I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

33:00.456 --> 33:09.683
BUT I THINK YOU DO,
BATWING.

33:09.726 --> 33:12.729
SHE'D FORGIVE YOU.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.906
YOU HAVE NO CLUE
HOW MUCH OF
A FIGHTER SHE WAS.

33:15.950 --> 33:19.171
I'M TALKING ABOUT PAM,

33:19.214 --> 33:19.910
THE WOMAN YOU FELL
IN LOVE WITH,

33:19.954 --> 33:22.304
NOT POISON IVY.

33:29.137 --> 33:31.270
FOR THE RECORD,
I TAKE HALF
THE BLAME

33:31.313 --> 33:34.099
FOR ALICE GOING FREE.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.926
NOT THE WISEST MOVE
ON MY PART.

33:35.970 --> 33:38.320
WE'LL FIND HER.
SHE'LL SCREW UP
EVENTUALLY,

33:38.364 --> 33:40.061
PING A TRAFFIC CAM,
ROB A BANK.

33:40.105 --> 33:43.673
ALICE? MORE LIKE HOLD UP
A DOUGHNUT SHOP.

33:46.850 --> 33:50.376
OH, MY GOD.
THE FRAUD ALERT.

33:52.378 --> 33:53.379
WHOEVER STOLE MY CARD,
THEY PURCHASED

33:53.422 --> 33:55.859
A 3-TIER STRAWBERRY
CHEESECAKE

33:55.903 --> 33:56.904
AND A GRAPE SODA,
THEN HAD IT SENT

33:56.947 --> 33:58.949
TO HER HOTEL ROOM.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.168
AND YOU THINK
IT WAS ALICE?

34:00.212 --> 34:02.692
KNOWING HER, SHE WON'T
BE THERE MUCH LONGER.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.781
I NEED TO GET HER BACK.
ARE YOU GOOD HERE?

34:04.825 --> 34:06.261
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE'S REANIMATING.
I'LL BE FINE.

34:09.525 --> 34:10.178
BE CAREFUL.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.885
SORRY, MA'AM.
ELEVATORS ARE
TEMPORARILY DOWN.

34:21.929 --> 34:23.974
ALL OF THEM? WHY?

34:24.018 --> 34:27.195
JUST SOME HICCUP
WITH THE BUILDING
COMPUTER SYSTEM.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.936
WE'LL GET YOU
ON YOUR WAY SHORTLY.

34:28.979 --> 34:32.113
OH, RYAN, WHEN WILL
YOU GIVE UP?

34:32.157 --> 34:33.201
THE STAIRS ARE BETTER
FOR MY CALVES ANYWAY.

34:42.732 --> 34:43.429
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

34:43.472 --> 34:45.474
CAKE?

34:45.518 --> 34:48.042
I BELIEVE YOU GET 5%
CASH BACK.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.435
- YOU LURED ME HERE?
- LURED YOU?

34:49.478 --> 34:51.828
LET'S NOT GET KINKY.

34:51.872 --> 34:52.960
ALICE, WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

34:55.310 --> 34:58.531
I MADE A JUICY DISCOVERY,

34:58.574 --> 34:59.749
AND I'VE BEEN DYING
TO TELL YOU,

34:59.793 --> 35:01.273
BUT YOU'VE BEEN SO HARD
TO GET ALONE LATELY.

35:01.316 --> 35:02.317
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO OUR FRIENDSHIP.

35:02.361 --> 35:05.146
WE DON'T HAVE ONE,
FOR STARTERS.

35:05.190 --> 35:09.368
BESIDES THE POINT.
YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND

35:09.411 --> 35:12.153
TO HOUSE ME
ON THAT PRISON COT
YOU CALL A PULL-OUT COUCH.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.547
I JUST WANTED TO RETURN
THE FAVOR.

35:14.590 --> 35:17.767
YOUR LITTLE LOVER
HAS BEEN PLAYING US.

35:17.811 --> 35:18.942
- RENEE?
- SURE,

35:18.986 --> 35:20.205
OR WHATEVER YOU CALL HER
UNDER THE SHEETS.

35:20.248 --> 35:24.383
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
DO ME FAVORS?

35:24.426 --> 35:26.689
BECAUSE RE-NAY-NAY
IS A LIAR,

35:26.733 --> 35:29.388
AND SHE NEEDS TO PAY
FOR BEING A BAD ONE.

35:29.431 --> 35:30.432
SAYS THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST LIAR.

35:30.476 --> 35:33.566
YOU KNOW, RENEE'S
HUGE MISTAKE

35:33.609 --> 35:35.045
WAS LEAVING ME ALONE
IN HER OFFICE.

35:35.089 --> 35:38.136
DID SHE NOT THINK
I WOULD SNOOP EVERY
NOOK AND CRANNY?

35:38.179 --> 35:40.312
LEFT CABINET,
SECOND DRAWER DOWN.

35:40.355 --> 35:41.356
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

35:54.587 --> 35:55.675
I DON'T WANT TO
HURT YOU, MARY.

35:59.418 --> 36:02.464
THERE'S ANOTHER
PROMISE BROKEN.

36:02.508 --> 36:07.252
OH! WHAT IS THAT?
DO YOU EVEN KNOW?

36:07.295 --> 36:08.644
BATMAN MADE IT
TO STOP POISON IVY.

36:08.688 --> 36:11.517
WHEN, A DECADE AGO?
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
THE HALF-LIFE

36:11.560 --> 36:13.301
OF ITS CHEMICAL COMPOUND?

36:13.345 --> 36:15.912
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
THAT'LL DO TO ME, DO YOU?

36:15.956 --> 36:18.132
YOU GAVE ME NO CHOICE.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.743
HEY, BATWOMAN.
HOLD UP.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.919
YOU READY FOR ME
TO BLOW YOUR MIND?

36:22.963 --> 36:26.488
HOW ABOUT WE KILL
YOUR TWO LITTLE
SIDEKICKS

36:26.532 --> 36:27.707
AT THE SAME TIME,
HMM?

36:27.750 --> 36:29.099
A LITTLE BROTHER-SISTER
BONDING ACTION?

36:29.143 --> 36:29.839
COME ON!

36:34.366 --> 36:38.631
IT WAS ME.
I TOLD HIM

36:38.674 --> 36:39.980
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT
US ALL THROUGH THAT

36:40.023 --> 36:41.547
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT" PHASE.

36:41.590 --> 36:44.550
MARY...HOW COULD YOU?

36:44.593 --> 36:47.379
YOU GAVE ME NO CHOICE.

36:47.422 --> 36:49.119
I ALWAYS
WONDERED WHY I WAS
THE KID

36:49.163 --> 36:51.296
THAT GOT CHOSE
ON THAT BUS THAT DAY.

36:51.339 --> 36:55.952
A COUPLE DOZEN KIDS,
SO WHY WAS I THE ONE
THAT GOT BUZZED?

36:55.996 --> 36:58.955
EVERYONE SAYS
THE WORLD'S GONE MAD,

36:58.999 --> 37:00.566
BUT I GET IT.

37:00.609 --> 37:04.134
BATMAN HAD THE JOKER,

37:04.178 --> 37:08.443
AND, BATWOMAN,
YOU GOT ME.

37:08.487 --> 37:09.401
TRUE OR FALSE, SIS--

37:09.444 --> 37:12.447
YOU GOTTA TRUST
DESTINY.

37:12.491 --> 37:15.755
FALSE. WE MAKE
OUR OWN DESTINIES.

37:15.798 --> 37:17.147
YOU WISH.

37:17.191 --> 37:18.845
UNH!

37:39.039 --> 37:40.910
I'VE BEEN
IN THE BEDROOM TRYING

37:40.954 --> 37:43.130
TO FINAGLE MY WAY
OUT OF SOPHIE'S HANDCUFFS,

37:43.173 --> 37:45.175
AND YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE
DRINKING ALL THE DOM?

37:49.702 --> 37:52.705
RYAN HAD ME BEAT.

37:52.748 --> 37:54.315
SHE WAS ABOUT TO INJECT
ME WITH SOMETHING,

37:54.359 --> 37:56.099
AND THEN SHE HESITATED.

37:56.143 --> 37:59.451
WHATEVER SHE WAS
ABOUT TO DO TO ME
SCARED HER.

37:59.494 --> 38:02.454
DON'T TELL YOU'RE GETTING
THE CONSCIENCE TINGLES.

38:02.497 --> 38:05.413
BEFORE I EVEN KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

38:05.457 --> 38:08.373
SHE USED THE SYRINGE
ON MARQUIS.

38:08.416 --> 38:11.419
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS
TO SAVE LUKE

38:11.463 --> 38:13.595
OR PROTECT HER SECRET.

38:15.380 --> 38:22.387
BUT ALL I KNOW IS
IN THAT MOMENT,

38:22.430 --> 38:25.999
I WAS THE LEAST
OF HER PROBLEMS.

38:26.042 --> 38:27.827
SHE STILL
UNDERESTIMATES YOU.

38:29.872 --> 38:33.789
I KNOW IT'S SILLY,
BUT A PART OF ME

38:33.833 --> 38:36.836
JUST WANTED HER TO
SEE ME AS POWERFUL.

38:40.622 --> 38:43.364
DO YOU KNOW ALL THOSE
LOONEY TUNE DELUSIONS
I'VE BEEN HAVING,

38:43.408 --> 38:46.498
POSTCARDS FROM DAD,
IMAGINARY FRIENDS,

38:46.541 --> 38:48.369
WALKING IN ON SOPHIE
IN THE SHOWER?

38:48.413 --> 38:51.851
THAT LAST ONE HAPPENED.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.809
OH.

38:53.853 --> 38:58.074
ANYWAY, SINCE YOUR WHOLE
POISON MARY METAMORPHOSIS,

38:58.118 --> 39:01.121
I HAVE YET TO HAVE
A SINGLE DELUSIONAL THOUGHT,

39:01.164 --> 39:03.166
WHICH MEANS BABY-SITTING
YOU, MY DEAR,

39:03.210 --> 39:06.039
HAS MADE ME LESS
OF A CRAZY PERSON,

39:06.082 --> 39:08.998
AND IF THAT'S NOT POWERFUL,

39:09.042 --> 39:11.131
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

39:21.228 --> 39:25.014
I KNOW YOU CAN'T HEAR ME.

39:25.058 --> 39:25.101
I KNOW YOU HATE ME...

39:29.192 --> 39:32.761
BUT I AM SORRY.

39:32.805 --> 39:33.936
I'VE BEEN SORRY
EVERY DAY I WAKE UP

39:33.980 --> 39:35.198
TO A BADGE AND NOT TO YOU.

39:47.994 --> 39:50.475
OH, MY GOD.

39:57.046 --> 40:02.269
PAM.

40:02.312 --> 40:05.577
PAM, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

40:05.620 --> 40:10.451
PAM?

40:49.142 --> 40:49.664
OH, MY GOD.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.756
DESICCATION
IS NOT PRETTY.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.498
DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD HOOK HIM UP
TO FLUIDS?

40:57.542 --> 40:59.457
NOT UNLESS YOU WANT HIM
TO WAKE UP.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.502
HE KNOWS WHO WE ARE.
THE SECOND HE WAKES UP,

41:01.546 --> 41:02.547
THE WHOLE WORLD
WILL, TOO.

41:02.590 --> 41:03.461
THAT'S A BIG, FAT IF
HE WAKES UP.

41:13.340 --> 41:15.211
JADA JET, THIS IS BATWOMAN.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.909
I HAVE YOUR SON.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A WAY

41:16.952 --> 41:19.259
TO FIX HIS BRAIN,
I SUGGEST YOU FIND IT QUICK.

41:22.175 --> 41:25.918
SOPHIE, HOW DO YOU
HAVE RECEPTION
IN THE TUNNELS?

41:25.961 --> 41:27.615
I'M NOT IN THE TUNNELS,
BUT YOU NEED TO GET THERE ASAP.

41:27.659 --> 41:30.183
SOPHIE, WHERE'S RENEE?

41:30.226 --> 41:31.358
YOU KNOW WHY YOU AND ALICE
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

41:31.401 --> 41:33.665
TO CROSS THE JOY BUZZER
OFF HER LIST?

41:33.708 --> 41:36.537
RENEE HAS HAD IT
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

41:36.581 --> 41:37.843
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SHE HAD IT?

41:37.886 --> 41:41.107
I MEAN, SHE WAS NEVER
GONNA LET ALICE FREE.

41:41.150 --> 41:46.112
SHE LIED, RYAN,
TO ALICE, TO YOU, TO ME.

41:46.155 --> 41:47.374
SHE WAS HOLDING IT
OVER YOUR HEADS

41:47.417 --> 41:49.419
TILL ONE OF YOU FOUND
WHAT SHE WANTED--

41:49.463 --> 41:52.901
HER SOUL MATE PAMELA ISLEY.

42:20.189 --> 42:22.017
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
