00:07.799 --> 00:09.801
Beth's e-mail said
she was frail from the chemo,

00:09.884 --> 00:11.803
but strong enough
to carry her one-year-old.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.888
Good. They don't gun down babies.

00:14.305 --> 00:15.640
I like the wall for this one.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.017
You, uh...

00:17.475 --> 00:18.977
You sticking with the wig and the tan?

00:19.811 --> 00:21.813
-That's smart.
-There's still our other problem.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.356
Brains.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.151
Mama had a guy at Zombie Services.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.361
He slipped us ID cards

00:28.445 --> 00:30.405
so our transplanted zombies
could get brains

00:30.488 --> 00:31.906
at the Fillmore Graves dispensaries.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.867
Mama's guy went AWOL.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.953
Have you two heard about
Brother Love's Zombie Salvation Show?

00:37.370 --> 00:38.621
-Yeah.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.874
Some zombie preacher I keep hearing about.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.292
Preaches zombie pride.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.752
And he gets brains for the needy.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.295
All pro bono.

00:52.927 --> 00:54.054
Bourbon, neat.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.722
What's that?

00:57.015 --> 00:57.932
Bermuda Rose.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.517
It's got gin and grenadine and--

00:59.601 --> 01:01.102
It's pink. It's pink, Seth.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.271
Are you looking for a big,
strong man to take you home tonight?

01:03.563 --> 01:04.564
Dump it. Get rid of it.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.901
Scale of one to ten,
what would you say you are?

01:08.651 --> 01:09.486
Um...

01:09.861 --> 01:10.695
Be honest. Six?

01:13.281 --> 01:16.451
-Sure. Yeah, five.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.661
Do what I say and you'll be
pulling sixes and sevens.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.289
What's she? A goddess.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.837
I know. She goes to my gym.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.005
I'm in love with her.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.174
Oh, Seth.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.467
You've taught me so much.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.635
Can't we just go over there,

01:33.885 --> 01:34.719
break the ice?

01:35.178 --> 01:36.137
Her friend's not bad.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.556
Max. Your website said that--

01:38.640 --> 01:41.434
My website didn't mention love.
That's not what this is about.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.856
Yeah. Sure. Fine.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.317
-Let's do it.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.819
-Here.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.363
It's peacocking.
You're standing out from the crowd.

01:53.613 --> 01:54.989
This says you are your own man.

01:55.573 --> 01:56.908
-I don't know.
-Wear it.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.409
Okay.

02:02.997 --> 02:04.791
All right. Here we go.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.085
What do we do first?

02:07.168 --> 02:09.671
Undermine her confidence.
Make her desperate for our approval.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.089
My man.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.552
Ladies. I'm Max. Meet my friend, Seth.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.971
He's a black belt in Jujitsu,
so don't make him mad.

02:18.054 --> 02:21.099
When he's not kicking ass,
he handles corporate accounts at Sun-West,

02:21.182 --> 02:24.185
the largest timeshare management company
on the West Coast.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.396
Hey, Seth. Cool scarf.

02:26.479 --> 02:27.313
Hi.

02:27.856 --> 02:28.857
We go to the same gym.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.859
I'm always right behind you in spin class.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.402
Good to know.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.197
I'm surprised to hear
you actually go to the gym.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.283
-Well, you have one of those bodies

02:38.449 --> 02:40.160
that's, you know...

02:40.994 --> 02:42.036
What?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.663
It's a compliment. You're curvy.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.001
"Curvy" means fat.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.587
Feel this.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.508
It tickles.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.512
Last night was, uh...

03:00.555 --> 03:01.389
Wow!

03:03.099 --> 03:04.058
You were right.

03:04.851 --> 03:08.897
I almost walked away from
something really special.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.736
Now, who's a little sleepyhead, huh?

03:15.987 --> 03:18.573
One part of you is ready for the day.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.659
Max?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.596
Here's what we know so far.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.057
Max Roberts, 39,

03:44.182 --> 03:47.477
was found dead by a woman
he brought home from the club last night.

03:48.311 --> 03:53.233
Max wrote a popular blog called
<i>Wet Willie's Sensitive Tips.</i>

03:53.316 --> 03:54.275
Ugh.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.069
A how-to on seducing women.

03:56.527 --> 03:59.614
But Roberts made
most of his money as a wingman-for-hire.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.074
That's a thing?

04:01.282 --> 04:03.618
So you finally decided
to get with the program, huh?

04:05.453 --> 04:06.496
You tanned and dyed.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.456
I figured, why fight it?

04:08.706 --> 04:10.250
All the cool zombies were doing it.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.293
-Mmm.
-Ah.

04:12.377 --> 04:16.130
You all look alike now, you zombies.
I can't even tell you apart.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.677
What the hell is a "Weener Kleener"? I'll bet it gives you a cleaner weiner.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.350
Morning-after pills.
And they say chivalry is dead.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.186
-Ooh.
-King Colossus brand condoms.

04:30.478 --> 04:31.646
Look at this.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.609
Whoa.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.236
God does give with both hands.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.779
No, no, no. Up here.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.656
See the rash on Max's stomach?

04:41.906 --> 04:44.993
Couple that with the yellowing
of his skin and my mind goes to poisoning.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.870
Which means we probably
already have our murderer.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.081
Max's one-night stand from the club.
Solved it!

04:55.211 --> 04:58.006
I guess we should have sex.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.925
Yeah. Why try and fight it?

05:05.179 --> 05:07.974
There. We don't have to have sex.

05:09.100 --> 05:09.934
Phew.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.477
That was close.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.692
Yay! No trace of neurosyphilis!

05:17.775 --> 05:19.569
Well, it's not all good news.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.030
Max's stomach lining
shows no sign of irritation.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.907
It's gonna take me a while to pin down
the exact method of poisoning.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.367
Maybe a vision will get us there.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.467
Mmm.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.556
Blue 19! Omaha! Hut!

05:52.018 --> 05:56.022
Go home. Suck down a brain tube.
Maybe drink water on occasion.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.238
You don't tell me when to leave.
I'm Fillmore Graves!

06:05.114 --> 06:06.532
This is our town!

06:09.911 --> 06:11.621
You're doing a bang-up job.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.445
You wanna know why I got to dust off
my ol' wakizashi?

06:44.821 --> 06:45.988
Not really.

06:46.364 --> 06:50.201
You're the turncoat who got
Blaine's dad out of the well.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.371
Blaine's pissed.
You'll see when he gets back.

06:53.454 --> 06:56.624
Did you hear me? Not interested.

06:56.707 --> 07:00.878
Classic Dino! Sparkling conversationalist.

07:00.962 --> 07:04.674
I worked with a mute,
and we had so much more fun.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.801
Miss you every day, Chief.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.346
Wanna know what I'm gonna do with you?

07:10.596 --> 07:12.223
Not really.

07:12.557 --> 07:18.354
I'm boxing you up
and I'm mailing you to Gwyneth Paltrow.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.315
She'd think that's funny, right?

07:22.150 --> 07:23.443
She seems cool.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.741
-Gwyneth would be all right.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.453
Max was so charming.

07:33.661 --> 07:37.582
He looked right into my eyes
and he said that he saw his future.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.334
-Aw.
-Ms. Lewis, we know Max was poisoned.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.461
According to the coroner,

07:41.544 --> 07:42.753
the poison would've killed Max

07:42.837 --> 07:44.672
within two hours of the dosing,

07:45.006 --> 07:46.966
so unless anyone else was with you...

07:47.175 --> 07:48.134
Like a...

07:48.217 --> 07:51.387
Oh, don't make us spell it out.
We're talking about a tag team.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.931
An Eiffel Tower. A Peter, Paul and Mary.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.519
I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant to suggest.

07:59.854 --> 08:00.771
Wait.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.316
You guys think I did this?

08:04.525 --> 08:07.612
No one kills a guy
that gives her multiple orgasms.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.906
I'm not sure that defense
will hold up in court.

08:09.989 --> 08:10.948
-Yeah.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.658
I like "Mandy" better.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.076
Well, no one calls me that.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.705
Mandy, you know our boy Max
was a chubby chaser, right?

08:17.955 --> 08:19.081
I'm not fat.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.293
I'm curvy. Max said that--

08:22.376 --> 08:23.461
Excuse us.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.965
I'm not fat.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.594
What are you doing?

08:31.677 --> 08:34.138
-I'm negging her, Clive.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.556
No, no, no. "Negging."

08:36.015 --> 08:39.018
I'm undermining her confidence
so that she'll be more vulnerable.

08:40.228 --> 08:42.230
-Knock it off.
-But...

08:46.651 --> 08:49.028
It's highly doubtful
that girl in there killed Max.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.822
-Max was poisoned with atro-choline.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.325
It's a toxic chemical
commonly used to make optical glass.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.994
But in his case,
it was absorbed through the skin.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.958
What's the one thing the killer knew
a womanizer would come into contact with?

09:02.041 --> 09:03.000
Ta-tas.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.336
-Let's not do this.
-Fine.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.463
His condoms were poisoned, Clive.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.757
Not a bad way to go. Who's with me?

09:13.594 --> 09:16.472
General Mills hasn't said a peep
about nuking Seattle,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.391
since you smuggled his daughter
into the city.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.353
That's one problem solved
on a very long list.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.064
There's a brain shortage
out there.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.108
Most of our problems come back to that.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.485
We've heard rumors that our own men
are skimming brains

09:29.569 --> 09:30.903
and selling them on the black market.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.781
I want you to find out who's behind it.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.162
You want me to find someone else to do it?

09:40.538 --> 09:42.039
You give the order, I'll do it.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.792
You just don't want to be a rat.
Am I right?

09:47.587 --> 09:48.921
Get over it.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.507
There is one name I know.

09:52.633 --> 09:53.593
Russ Roche.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.511
Roche is a dolt.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.013
No way he's the ringleader.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.182
I want you to buddy up to him.

10:00.933 --> 10:01.809
Fun, fun.

10:01.892 --> 10:05.146
If he likes getting a colonic,
you take him out for his-and-his colonics.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.106
Make him a colonic-themed mixtape.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.691
Just find out who's calling the shots.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.151
Sir, is there a reason

10:10.234 --> 10:11.986
you think your office is bugged?

10:13.112 --> 10:14.280
Yes.

10:17.867 --> 10:18.951
Major.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.495
Be careful with Roche.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.750
He's not smart, but he is a killer.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.054
Thanks for coming in, Ms. Zoe Ward.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.306
You heard that Max Roberts was murdered?

10:40.389 --> 10:41.474
That's what they told me.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.894
Can you confirm whether
you sent the deceased the following text?

10:45.519 --> 10:48.064
"I hope your eggplant emoji falls off,

10:48.522 --> 10:51.233
and you drown in a pool
of your own poop emoji.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.528
I hate your pig-face emoji,
you rooster emoji."

10:54.612 --> 10:56.864
-I did.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.325
Because I was hoping
his eggplant would fall off.

10:59.575 --> 11:02.328
Max Roberts was a vile creature.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.163
-A predator.
-A misogynist.

11:04.246 --> 11:05.289
A complete dick.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.626
That didn't stop you from saddling up
and riding that stallion, did it?

11:08.751 --> 11:11.712
To my eternal shame.
Though, I have to say...

11:11.796 --> 11:13.130
At least he was good at that.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.925
If it hadn't been amazing, I wouldn't have
been pissed that he ghosted me.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.510
God, no. Gross.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.804
I didn't sleep with Max Roberts.
Thank God.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.806
Huh. I'm not surprised.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.767
Max had a hard rule about sevens.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.353
Okay...

11:28.145 --> 11:30.940
But he probably also had
a hard rule against zombies.

11:31.899 --> 11:32.900
You're a zombie?

11:34.985 --> 11:37.405
Then can you explain why you texted Max,

11:38.114 --> 11:40.116
"You're going to pay
for what you did to me.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.368
Butcher knife emoji."

11:42.451 --> 11:44.161
My friend sent that text.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.456
She slept with Max,
and then he blocked her number.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.417
My phone was handy,
so we had fun one night

11:49.500 --> 11:50.751
passing the phone back and forth,

11:51.085 --> 11:53.129
sending him juvenile messages.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.006
Can I get your friend's information?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.762
One night we saw him at the club,

12:01.846 --> 12:03.389
and he got all up in our faces like,

12:03.472 --> 12:04.682
"You're not funny!"

12:06.851 --> 12:09.687
Now get me out of this mess, Max.
Otherwise, we're both going down!

12:14.608 --> 12:16.777
Here. That's her info.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.822
Thanks. You're free to go.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.742
And I'm a ten.

12:25.744 --> 12:26.620
So?

12:26.704 --> 12:28.956
A Fillmore Graves soldier
was screaming at Max...

12:29.039 --> 12:32.543
"Get me out of some mess,
otherwise we'll both go down."

12:32.918 --> 12:35.171
His name tag said "G. Marsh."

12:35.504 --> 12:38.257
I'll track down this "G. Marsh."

12:38.883 --> 12:40.009
Take your time.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.136
All that sex talk made me horny.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.306
Mind telling Ravi that I left early
to tap some ass?

12:46.682 --> 12:48.309
Yeah. I'll get right on that.

12:49.185 --> 12:54.773
"Tapping that ass."

12:55.774 --> 12:59.945
The guys said the Triple Cross Church
is in a converted triple-X theater.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.864
The things I would do to you.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.700
-Yes.

13:06.410 --> 13:10.414
I mean, I get it. My ass is grade-A.
But do you always come on this strong?

13:11.415 --> 13:13.083
I am so sorry.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.878
I'm solving the murder
of this douchebag player.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.423
Did you get tired of wearing the wig?

13:19.548 --> 13:21.759
Yes, but I also thought
our zombie-pride preacher

13:21.842 --> 13:23.010
would prefer this look.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.429
Always thinking.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.724
Well, this must be it.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.525
Hello?

13:39.902 --> 13:41.820
Anybody here?

13:53.165 --> 13:56.418
Come here. Look at this.
<i>The Teachings of Brother Love.</i>

13:56.544 --> 13:58.921
"Man shall offer himself
to his zombie brethren,

13:59.046 --> 14:02.758
and his brethren shall crack
a man's skull and scoop his brains..."

14:02.841 --> 14:04.718
-Or this...

14:04.843 --> 14:06.637
"Those who wear
the Fillmore Graves uniform

14:06.720 --> 14:09.390
are in league with the humans
who would see us destroyed."

14:10.391 --> 14:12.851
Okay. Maybe he's got a point on that one.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.230
Brother Love!

14:17.064 --> 14:18.232
Hello?

14:19.525 --> 14:20.901
You have guests.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.321
Wonderful news!

14:25.531 --> 14:29.034
-Not exactly.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.411
-Redemption!
-No.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.913
-We're here to talk about brains.

14:33.831 --> 14:34.790
You're hungry.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.667
-I should pat them down.
-No need.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.794
No need.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.297
-I'm Brother Love.
-Levon.

14:41.505 --> 14:42.339
Levon.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.636
-Liv.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.763
Liv! Must be an angel.

14:50.639 --> 14:54.935
With skin the color of the pearly gates,
and milky tresses to match.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.898
As the Almighty intended. Natural.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.941
You say you're hungry?

15:01.150 --> 15:02.860
We're not asking for us.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.945
We know a few newly-turned zombies

15:05.029 --> 15:07.698
who can't get brains
through the official channels.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.451
We heard you feed hungry zombies here.

15:10.534 --> 15:13.162
I have a soft spot for the downtrodden.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.747
Where do you get your brains?

15:15.164 --> 15:18.334
Oh, donations from the dying, mostly.

15:18.417 --> 15:22.046
And a few brain tubes that fall through
the cracks at Fillmore Graves.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.965
And a weekly free meal at Romero's.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.426
Romero's? I know the owner,

15:27.509 --> 15:29.511
-he's not exactly charitable.
-Yes, my son Blaine.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.350
Quick as a whip.
Voice of a nightingale.

15:34.433 --> 15:38.187
Successful to boot. And single.

15:39.146 --> 15:39.980
Huh.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.571
Still no word back
from that friend of Zoe Ward,

15:48.113 --> 15:50.783
the zombie who let her friend
send threatening texts from her phone.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.242
I think I banged that dude.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.704
Chase Graves? Yeah, you banged him.

15:55.829 --> 15:58.248
Oh. I remember now.

15:58.332 --> 16:01.377
He's gonna be all,
"Oh, Liv, why didn't you call?

16:01.460 --> 16:04.338
Didn't that bone sesh on my hotel room
desk mean anything to you?"

16:04.880 --> 16:08.175
Dudes. Look at him. Look how sad he looks.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.846
That's probably a suicide note
he's working on.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.147
Look at you, Ms. Moore.
Finally with the program.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.608
It's over, dude.
I don't know what you want me to say.

16:25.734 --> 16:26.986
Detective.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.404
We've been getting the runaround

16:28.487 --> 16:30.197
trying to track down one of your men.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.198
George Marsh.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.450
He's a person of interest
in a murder investigation.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.493
When was the murder?

16:34.702 --> 16:35.577
Two days ago.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.996
And you think Marsh did it?

16:37.079 --> 16:38.080
It's possible.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.748
He's unavailable.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.542
If you come back,
I can have him here tomorrow.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.751
"Unavailable"?

16:43.335 --> 16:46.171
There's nowhere he could be
that's more than 25 minutes from here.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.049
And, yet, tomorrow is
as soon as you can see him.

16:51.802 --> 16:54.388
I need another minute
for the toxicology report.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.890
Liv changed our filing system.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.810
The deceased are now arranged
by hotness quotient.

17:01.645 --> 17:02.896
You're on Tinder, Clive?

17:06.900 --> 17:08.569
Clive

17:10.779 --> 17:13.365
Wait! Does this mean
you and Bozzio are dunzo?

17:13.449 --> 17:14.992
No!

17:15.534 --> 17:18.037
Relationships take work, Clive.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.539
Look at me and Peyton.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.792
We had a rough go, but we didn't give up.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.336
Well, it's not the same.
We didn't cheat on each other.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.588
No one cheated!

17:27.671 --> 17:30.799
We can't have sex together,
so we're in an open relationship.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.386
Y'all wanted us to be the No Secrets Club?
Well, there you go.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.221
Oh.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.143
Did... Did you delete your matches?

17:41.643 --> 17:42.728
What matches?

17:45.773 --> 17:48.984
This is bad. This is really bad.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.405
Why would you upload
a photo of yourself

17:53.489 --> 17:54.865
standing next to Seven

17:54.948 --> 17:58.285
It's my police academy graduation.
I look good in a uniform.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.748
That does it.
I'm taking you out tonight, Clive.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.249
I'm a phenomenal wingman.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.460
I hate going out. Mmm-mmm.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.588
Oh, we know.
It says so here in your list of "hates."

18:10.005 --> 18:12.674
You hate warm weather, and <i>This Is Us.</i>

18:14.760 --> 18:16.887
Yeah, it's emotionally manipulative.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.684
Fine. I'll go.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.853
You're emotionally manipulative.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.939
Mmm. Oh, uh, where are my keys?

18:27.022 --> 18:28.357
Oh, they're on my desk.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.403
-One rule for tonight.
-Mmm.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.947
Given the brain she's on...

18:35.405 --> 18:36.365
-Don't tell Liv.
-Don't tell Liv.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.202
Is the record skipping or is the music
supposed to sound like this?

18:40.285 --> 18:41.537
Quick. Pound this.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.417
Pound this one, too.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.503
-Mmm! I need a minute.
-Pound it!

18:50.546 --> 18:54.883
Oh, look at this.
Coming our way. Coming our way.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.385
Oh, God.

18:58.011 --> 19:01.473
Hello, ladies. Your money is no good here.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.850
Let my friend and I buy you a drink.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.352
-We're actually just--
-Bartender!

19:08.897 --> 19:10.023
Your finest.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.570
This is my friend, Clive.
He's a homicide detective.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.113
Me? I'm a coroner.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.699
I know.
What a fascinating pair of gentlemen.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.534
They must have loads of stories.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.870
Tell them how fascinating you are, Clive.

19:24.746 --> 19:25.747
I'm riveting.

19:27.457 --> 19:30.210
So, what's the craziest thing
you've ever seen on the job?

19:30.294 --> 19:35.340
Oh, Clive. You gotta tell this one.
You're the raconteur.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.842
Oh, um...

19:36.925 --> 19:41.471
Well, probably the middle-aged mom
who was smashed by a falling AC unit.

19:41.555 --> 19:45.893
Brains and guts everywhere.
Children walking by splattered with blood.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.354
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.732
This is my boyfriend, Gunner.

19:51.815 --> 19:54.193
And that's Julie's boyfriend, Stieg.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.905
Here you go. Enjoy.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.412
Let's ease into
the splattered-brain talk next time.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.372
Is that where it went wrong?

20:07.456 --> 20:08.290
I thought it was when

20:08.373 --> 20:10.834
their Scandinavian
He-Men boyfriends showed up.

20:13.879 --> 20:18.675
Amateur hour is over, boys.
Let's go get us some nasty.

20:30.020 --> 20:35.943
Clive should be himself,
only fun and less tightly-wound.

20:37.486 --> 20:41.281
Clive should be another person.
A better person.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.162
Just give me the hat, Liv.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.965
I was hoping for a
<i>Frosty the Snowman</i> moment.

20:58.048 --> 21:01.218
And the instant we gave him the hat,
he would become full of life.

21:01.301 --> 21:05.430
He'd have swagger.
He'd be crackling with sexual magnetism.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.849
What kind of perverse version
of <i>Frosty the Snowman</i>

21:07.933 --> 21:09.226
did they show kids in England?

21:09.309 --> 21:10.227
Look.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.024
You know, I could catch any D
I want in this place?

21:16.149 --> 21:18.068
Most of the guys in here are human.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.696
They won't be when I'm making them brains
for breakfast.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.489
Just kidding.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.825
I'm not gonna let them stay for breakfast.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.538
Oh, code red. The herd has arrived.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.374
That better be a photo of his penis.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.126
And it looks like she's crying.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.545
Okay, it probably is his penis.

21:36.753 --> 21:37.671
Come on.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.800
He was still waiting in line
when she got the Aleutian flu vaccine.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.927
That's when he got the call
about the zombie virus.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.512
How sad is that?

21:45.595 --> 21:49.099
Okay, baby dolls.
I'm gonna need you to put out or get out.

21:49.182 --> 21:51.852
Hit it or quit it.
Hump or dump. You follow me?

21:51.935 --> 21:53.270
-Mmm.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.357
You told them about Bozzio?

21:57.482 --> 21:59.526
-I wanna be honest.
-That is dumb.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.987
I'm not going to be a liar to get sex.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.364
-Good luck with that.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.742
I'm done here.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.077
Thanks for trying to help.

22:13.790 --> 22:14.875
You blew it.

22:16.209 --> 22:18.628
Think I'm gonna go catch that D
I was talking about.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.090
I think I'm gonna go home
and make love to my girlfriend.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.884
Don't be gross.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.261
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:26.553 --> 22:27.804
I was in the neighborhood.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.931
I thought maybe we could talk
more strategy?

22:30.015 --> 22:31.266
Save a few more lives?

22:31.391 --> 22:34.227
Is that before or after you texted me,
"Down to duck"?

22:35.062 --> 22:38.774
I sent that text to like, ten other guys.
Don't read into it.

22:39.649 --> 22:42.903
But are you

22:42.986 --> 22:45.530
This isn't a good idea.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.908
When you talk,
it accentuates your double chin.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.202
Are you negging me?

22:50.827 --> 22:51.995
What do you think of my hat?

22:52.079 --> 22:53.663
I think Kevin Federline wore it better.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.581
Are you negging me?

22:54.664 --> 22:56.833
No, I genuinely don't like your hat.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.339
Liv, I'm not hooking up with you
while you're on this brain.

23:02.422 --> 23:06.802
Whatever. I don't care.
I'm like barely even interested in you.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.556
I'm gonna get you a Lyft.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.976
Fine, but can I at least see
what my driver looks like?

23:15.602 --> 23:16.770
Oh, never mind.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.897
Everyone's a ten
if you keep your eyes closed.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.826
I was wondering if you'd ever call.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.410
Come in, Detective.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.212
"Martyr Leone"?

23:42.295 --> 23:43.755
Are you freaking kidding me?

23:44.548 --> 23:46.299
And you can probably guess
what they say about me. Let's see.

23:46.383 --> 23:49.302
I spend more time at the gym
than I do at my desk.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.972
I'm a demagogue who uses
the city's tax dollars

23:52.055 --> 23:53.598
to eat brains at Romero's.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.645
It's one article. In one newspaper.

24:01.731 --> 24:06.945
I'm sorry, Commander.
Can I ask what Lillywhite is doing here?

24:07.028 --> 24:09.656
Did he get some kind of promotion
we weren't made aware of?

24:10.157 --> 24:10.991
Oh.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.451
Did I forget the paperwork?

24:14.119 --> 24:15.078
I might have.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.164
I've had my hands full.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.168
Major is the new vice president
of getting stuff done.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.670
Which means he outranks
any of you because...

24:23.753 --> 24:25.338
Well, he gets stuff done.

24:27.340 --> 24:28.175
Everyone out.

24:32.262 --> 24:35.849
Except my VP of getting stuff done!
You, get back in here.

24:45.066 --> 24:45.901
Sir?

24:45.984 --> 24:47.402
You made any progress with Roche?

24:47.485 --> 24:50.822
I’ve lost 100 bucks to him playing pool,
buddying up to him,

24:50.906 --> 24:52.949
and we made plans to hit
The Scratching Post next week.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.993
What do you say we turn you into besties?

24:55.160 --> 24:58.705
Take Roche’s unit down to the offices
of the <i>206 Weekly</i> and shut them down.

24:58.788 --> 25:00.790
Do we have the authority to do that, sir?

25:00.874 --> 25:02.167
We are the authority.

25:04.419 --> 25:06.713
Oh, God. Oh, God.

25:06.796 --> 25:07.714
Oh, God.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.009
You're in a hurry.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.637
I thought I set my alarm.

25:13.970 --> 25:17.224
This is bad. This is really bad.

25:21.478 --> 25:22.312
Um...

25:25.398 --> 25:26.566
I've never done this.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.361
How much?

25:34.741 --> 25:38.620
Hey, any idea why Liv Moore
would text me "Down to duck"

25:38.703 --> 25:39.871
in the middle of the night?

25:39.955 --> 25:42.165
My wife was pissed,
I had to sleep on the couch.

25:42.874 --> 25:43.708
No clue.

26:04.312 --> 26:05.188
Clive.

26:09.943 --> 26:11.278
Called a few times.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.613
Went straight to voicemail.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.116
My phone died.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.284
I was worried.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.618
I'm sorry.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.833
Maybe we need to establish
some ground rules.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.794
Spending the night feels
like there's emotions involved.

26:28.545 --> 26:29.796
That's a good rule.

26:30.255 --> 26:34.092
But, Dale,
there were no emotions involved.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.262
Promise.

26:37.345 --> 26:38.972
Did you make her your special breakfast?

26:39.889 --> 26:43.601
I haven't asked for any details
about the men you've been with.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.479
Well, I haven't slept with anyone, Clive.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.190
I heard--

26:49.274 --> 26:50.400
I went on some dates.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.987
I made out with a guy.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.408
All it did was make me miss you.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.498
I guess we're really doing this.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.520
Chase better walk in here
with that zombie from your vision.

27:27.812 --> 27:28.813
We gave him a day.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.565
Hey, I just noticed.

27:30.648 --> 27:33.443
That's the same outfit as last night,
you dirty dog.

27:33.651 --> 27:36.154
-You got some chick--
-I don't wanna talk about it, Liv.

27:37.739 --> 27:38.907
Thanks for waiting, Officers.

27:40.116 --> 27:42.077
You'll see this was a bit of a to-do.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.165
Here's the man of the hour.

27:50.293 --> 27:51.252
This the guy?

27:51.544 --> 27:52.921
That’s the guy from my vision.

27:53.004 --> 27:56.132
Marsh, the Seattle PD wants to know
if you magically defrosted yourself

27:56.216 --> 27:57.425
and murdered someone a few days ago.

27:57.634 --> 27:58.593
What year is it?

27:59.469 --> 28:01.429
You haven’t even been frozen
a month, Marsh.

28:01.554 --> 28:03.181
It’s a long way from 2023.

28:03.264 --> 28:04.182
Damn.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.476
-Max Roberts.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.396
Max is dead

28:09.479 --> 28:10.688
Poisoned condoms.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.149
Perfect.

28:13.858 --> 28:18.154
Well, as the Commander can confirm,
my alibi is airtight.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.989
I had a vision of you berating Max.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.699
Did that have something
to do with your arrest?

28:21.783 --> 28:22.784
Can't answer that.

28:23.243 --> 28:26.579
My lawyer told me to keep my mouth shut.
I filed an appeal.

28:26.663 --> 28:30.375
Marsh was found guilty of turning a human
into a zombie through sexual contact.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.585
She reported him for not
disclosing his status.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.504
She told me she was a zombie.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.798
Guess she was a bug chaser.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.633
You hired Max to be your wingman

28:38.717 --> 28:41.803
and that’s when you hooked up
with this "bug chaser"?

28:41.886 --> 28:43.722
My lawyer was very clear on this.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.223
Shut my mouth.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.599
What was this woman's name?

28:53.231 --> 28:54.232
Huma Kattan. Thank you.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.488
Looking good, Liv Moore.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.823
You wish.

29:03.616 --> 29:06.995
All right, look into it.
You got anything else?

29:07.078 --> 29:08.872
I've also been hearing these
weird things about a zombie church.

29:08.955 --> 29:10.415
-They say--

29:10.874 --> 29:11.833
What the hell?

29:11.916 --> 29:13.626
What is this all about, here?

29:13.710 --> 29:15.170
-I'm the editor.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.422
I need you to direct your people
to shut down their computers,

29:17.505 --> 29:18.798
pack up their personal belongings

29:18.882 --> 29:20.216
-and exit the building.
-You can't.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.970
Your newspaper is being closed down
for the public good.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.473
"The public good"

29:26.556 --> 29:28.141
You're printing fake news.

29:28.224 --> 29:30.393
That Mama Leone lady
was making more zombies

29:30.477 --> 29:32.687
when we can’t feed the zombies
we already have. We are on the precipice of destruction
at all times.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.692
The old rules of freedom of the press
no longer apply.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.987
You! Do not take any computer equipment.

29:41.070 --> 29:44.741
This includes any kind of hard drive,
thumb drive, memory stick.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.075
It all stays here.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.285
No. No way.

29:47.368 --> 29:49.370
If you're shutting us down,
I'm taking my work--

29:57.504 --> 29:59.631
What do you expect from the Chaos Killer?

30:04.969 --> 30:07.931
That's my name, baby. Don't wear it out.

30:17.315 --> 30:20.401
-Thanks again. Bye.
-No, it's "Huma Kattan."

30:20.819 --> 30:21.653
No?

30:22.153 --> 30:23.404
All right, bye.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.199
The DMV has no record of her either.

30:26.741 --> 30:29.410
How does a zombie disappear
from a walled city?

30:32.622 --> 30:35.458
If you scratched me right now,
what's the first thing I'd do?

30:36.042 --> 30:37.460
Take Bozzio to Bone Town.

30:39.587 --> 30:40.672
After that,

30:40.922 --> 30:44.050
I’d go to the Zombie Services office
for an ID card.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.761
This Huma needed a card
to get brain tubes.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.513
They’d have her contact info.

30:48.596 --> 30:49.430
That's it.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.767
We’ll go to Zombie Services,
where they make ID cards,

30:52.851 --> 30:54.227
on official police business!

30:54.936 --> 30:58.690
How about we pop over during lunchtime,
so we create less of a disturbance.

30:59.357 --> 31:01.484
Yeah, I guess.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.528
You don't wanna go sooner? Oh, no. Lunchtime is good.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.323
I may wanna sleep in.

31:11.953 --> 31:14.372
I know how to get brains
for the Underground Railroad.

31:14.455 --> 31:15.790
I'm not falling for this again.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.709
Douchebag brain has worn off,
you can let me in.

31:18.835 --> 31:19.919
Finally.

31:21.671 --> 31:22.922
Clive and I are on a case,

31:23.006 --> 31:24.465
blah, blah, blah, long story short,

31:24.549 --> 31:26.593
we have to go to
the Zombie Services office

31:26.676 --> 31:28.052
on police business tomorrow.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.431
I can steal what we need
to create our own ID cards.

31:31.514 --> 31:34.851
Everyone we smuggle into Seattle
will have access to brain tubes.

31:34.934 --> 31:37.353
That’s dangerous, Liv. If you get caught--

31:37.437 --> 31:38.646
It's worth the risk.

31:40.607 --> 31:44.152
Be careful, these guys smash zombie heads.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.613
About last night.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.282
Really embarrassed.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.242
It's water under the bridge.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.202
No, I need to say this.

31:54.078 --> 31:57.248
Sometimes, my job gets in
the way of my personal life.

31:57.332 --> 32:02.962
I’m on a lot of brains and in the past
with guys I’ve dated it's caused problems.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.048
I can roll with a few lousy brains.

32:06.257 --> 32:09.177
In most cases,
I would’ve welcomed sex-crazed brain,

32:09.260 --> 32:12.347
but, you know, the first time,
I thought, should be special.

32:13.681 --> 32:14.974
I’m a little girlish that way.

32:31.950 --> 32:32.992
What are you doing?

32:33.076 --> 32:35.828
Shh. Let your body do the talking.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.664
Oh! You...

32:37.747 --> 32:40.416
You are still on the brain, aren't you?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.502
Don't hate the player.

32:42.585 --> 32:46.589
You, out! You made me feel cheap.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.050
Whatevs. You are a bit girlish.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.760
Text me if you have a change of heart.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.858
All right, let's do this.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.402
Let's.

33:09.862 --> 33:12.907
I never thought I'd say this,
but I miss the fedora.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.995
I'm peacocking, Clive.
I thought I explained this to you.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.920
Donuts for the unsung heroes of Seattle.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.172
Lots of zombie-friendly options.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.258
Sure. Thanks.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.592
Cool-ass hat.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.553
You're a cool-ass dude for noticing.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.514
You're up to something, what is it?

33:36.597 --> 33:39.100
It's called donuting.
You know nothing, Clive Babineaux.

33:43.813 --> 33:46.733
Hi, Jill. We're with the SPD.

33:46.816 --> 33:50.111
We’re tracking down a person
of interest in a murder investigation.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.613
Her name is Huma Kattan and
she recently became a zombie.

33:52.697 --> 33:53.698
Can you help us with that?

33:53.781 --> 33:56.701
Everyone’s heading to lunch,
but I can show you where the records are.

33:56.784 --> 33:57.869
That would be great.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.248
Zombie-friendly donuts. Get them here.

34:04.667 --> 34:08.046
There's a file
for every zombie in Seattle.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.714
Some of them are passing for human.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.632
Sadly, we’re so understaffed

34:11.716 --> 34:14.010
that files just get thrown back in there,
willy-nilly.

34:14.635 --> 34:15.678
"Kattan," right?

34:15.803 --> 34:17.055
That's right.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.185
Come on, come on.

34:23.394 --> 34:24.729
Darn.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.439
You may be in for the long haul.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.533
Did you find Huma’s file?

34:38.076 --> 34:38.993
Nope.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.370
Did they have mirrors in the bathroom?

34:41.454 --> 34:42.330
Yes.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.999
So you saw what you looked like
and didn’t take off the hat?

34:46.542 --> 34:48.169
Lunch is ending. We need to hurry.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.922
-Because we don't wanna be in their way.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.636
I was sitting there at lunch
and I thought to myself,

34:56.719 --> 34:59.138
what about the new zombie files
that haven't been filed?

34:59.222 --> 35:00.556
The ones we keep up front.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.267
So I hurried back. Here you go.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.144
Thank you.

35:15.404 --> 35:16.906
Well, well, well.

35:18.157 --> 35:19.742
Does Huma look familiar? That's Zoe Ward.

35:22.870 --> 35:24.372
The zombie who said her friend

35:24.455 --> 35:26.082
sent Max those threatening texts
from her phone.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.793
Yeah, well,
I don’t think there ever was a friend.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.837
She's only been a zombie a few weeks.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.048
So, when she went to get an ID card
she still went by the name Huma.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.593
So Huma gets George Marsh
put away in the Fillmore Graves freezer...

35:37.677 --> 35:39.303
Then changes her name to Zoe Ward

35:39.387 --> 35:41.681
and settles the score with the guy
who taught George

35:41.806 --> 35:42.682
how to seduce her.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.058
She's our killer.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.852
Sweet, let's go pick her up right now.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.028
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:56.737 --> 35:59.407
Afraid I'm gonna have to take
another look at what's inside that box.

35:59.490 --> 36:02.535
Two donuts?
You sure that's a good idea, big fella?

36:02.618 --> 36:04.954
Think of all the hungry zombie cops
back at the station

36:05.037 --> 36:06.205
who you promised donuts?

36:06.289 --> 36:07.623
They won't miss just one. They will.

36:13.462 --> 36:14.922
Take all you want, good sir.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.151
Liv.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.321
Do I wanna know what you're up to?

36:38.779 --> 36:40.364
I think it's better that you don't.

36:51.792 --> 36:55.671
Tell us why you changed your name
from Huma Kattan to Zoe Ward.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.090
I’d just transitioned from
human to zombie.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.218
It's a big life change.

37:00.801 --> 37:01.928
It was a new beginning.

37:03.012 --> 37:06.015
What I have here is a transcript
from the Fillmore Graves hearing

37:06.098 --> 37:08.976
that sent George Marsh to the deep freeze.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.270
"Huma asked for it.

37:11.354 --> 37:13.981
She knew George was a zombie,
and she threw herself at him.

37:14.565 --> 37:15.733
She was a bug chaser.

37:15.816 --> 37:18.611
One of those girls who wanted
to get with a zombie,

37:19.278 --> 37:20.863
wanted to be a zombie."

37:21.072 --> 37:23.032
That’s what Max Roberts said on the stand.

37:23.115 --> 37:25.284
Max Roberts is a pig and a liar.

37:25.368 --> 37:27.078
He was a pig and a liar.

37:27.536 --> 37:29.956
Max is dead
and George is in a deep freeze.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.083
Max introduced George to you, didn’t he?

37:32.375 --> 37:33.251
Yeah.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.920
When did you find out that Max
was a paid wingman,

37:36.420 --> 37:37.755
an expert on seducing women?

37:37.838 --> 37:41.926
When a friend showed me his column.
<i>Wet Willie's Sensitive Tips.</i>

37:42.009 --> 37:43.177
Repulsive, right?

37:43.261 --> 37:46.305
Max was killed by a toxic substance
used to make optical glass.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.641
Where do you work now?

37:52.979 --> 37:54.605
Queen Anne Optometry.

37:56.315 --> 37:57.942
How did you get the poisoned condoms to--

37:58.276 --> 38:01.237
It was easy, I dressed up like
a giant condom and handed out

38:01.320 --> 38:02.822
free samples outside the club.

38:03.197 --> 38:05.116
Made sure Max got a special box.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.742
That's easy?

38:08.619 --> 38:10.121
We'll need it in writing.

38:11.914 --> 38:15.251
I wanted a normal life. I wanted kids.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.004
George took that away from me
without my consent.

38:18.087 --> 38:21.632
Max helped him and then went
on the stand and humiliated me.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.344
At least the son of bitch
can't hurt any more women.

38:25.970 --> 38:26.929
So, you know what?

38:27.680 --> 38:30.391
They can stick me in a freezer
for however long they want.

38:32.810 --> 38:35.187
My life was over
the moment I met Max Roberts.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.196
Come on, Chase. It was a mistake.
Admit it and move on.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.073
Shooting up a newspaper office,
shutting them down,

38:46.157 --> 38:48.784
it's like you're begging humans to riot.

38:49.076 --> 38:51.746
-No reports of riots.

38:54.123 --> 38:55.499
I'm placing a bet.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.210
I'm betting that no one cares enough
to take to the streets

38:58.294 --> 39:01.172
over one rinky-dink alt-weekly
closing its doors.

39:01.255 --> 39:04.216
I suppose all the city's sex workers will
have to find a new place to advertise.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.844
Shutting down the press
over a critical story.

39:08.220 --> 39:09.930
Isn't that what an autocrat does?

39:11.432 --> 39:12.850
That's what I am.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.979
You wanna know when democracy
doesn't work?

39:19.440 --> 39:21.734
It doesn't work
when you're sitting on a powder keg.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.987
It doesn't work
when your people are starving.

39:25.071 --> 39:28.407
It doesn't work when your entire species
is on the brink of extinction.

39:28.532 --> 39:31.452
So, you can lament the closing
of the <i>206 Weekly.</i>

39:31.577 --> 39:33.579
But they tried to make a hero
out of a woman who made it

39:33.662 --> 39:35.498
harder to keep our population fed.

39:36.415 --> 39:39.794
I want human smuggling stopped,
so I can save lives.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.629
I don't regret the execution
of that woman.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.130
I didn't ask if you did.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.467
Your soldiers didn't just lock
the doors of the <i>206 Weekly.</i>

39:46.550 --> 39:48.052
They terrorized the staff.

39:48.677 --> 39:50.721
They caused thousands
of dollars in damages--

39:50.805 --> 39:52.473
Fake news.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.644
Fake, huh?

39:57.478 --> 39:59.647
-Nope.

40:00.898 --> 40:01.982
You sure about that?

40:02.108 --> 40:04.693
Lillywhite, clear this up. What happened?

40:06.737 --> 40:08.447
The situation was under control

40:08.531 --> 40:10.950
until reporters failed
to follow instructions.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.952
They became belligerent and attacked us.

40:13.702 --> 40:16.330
The limited gunfire was warranted
to control the situation.

40:17.039 --> 40:18.374
So, there you have it.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.294
Well, we always appreciate
a visit from the mayor's office.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.505
We need to do this more often.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.393
Liv, it's street-cleaning tomorrow.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.229
Better move your car
or you'll get a ticket.

40:41.564 --> 40:42.481
Liv?

40:46.402 --> 40:47.820
Hello?

41:09.842 --> 41:11.177
What the hell are you doing?
