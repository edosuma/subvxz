[hangs up]

24:57.289 --> 25:00.584
- Oh, Lake, honey, don't slouch.

25:00.584 --> 25:03.128
You're gonna wind up with a turtle body.

25:06.298 --> 25:09.051
- Mom, why do you criticize
everything about me?

25:11.178 --> 25:13.680
- What? Where is this coming from?

25:13.680 --> 25:17.267
- My weight, my clothes,
the way that I sit in this chair.

25:17.267 --> 25:20.479
This morning you corrected
my pronunciation of the word "croissant."

25:20.479 --> 25:22.814
Wait, is that right? Cross-ant? Cwah-san?

25:22.814 --> 25:24.274
I mean, now I don't
even know how to say it.

25:24.274 --> 25:28.737
The point is, you're never happy...
no matter what I do.

25:31.823 --> 25:36.703
- I am so sorry. I had no idea.

25:38.247 --> 25:41.542
So, you know I'm a public persona.
- Yeah, I heard that somewhere.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.293
- Just let me finish.

25:43.293 --> 25:45.295
So, sometimes after the 5:00 news,

25:45.295 --> 25:48.215
I like to go online
and see what the fans have to say.

25:48.215 --> 25:52.845
And... nine times out of 10,
it is not about the story.

25:52.845 --> 25:58.475
It's about my blazer,
or my hair, or my voice,

25:58.475 --> 26:02.062
and I just thought maybe I could help
you present your best self to the world,

26:02.062 --> 26:04.273
and you could avoid that kind of bullying.

26:06.984 --> 26:10.028
But what I hear you saying
is I'm the bully.

26:14.867 --> 26:15.909
Lake,

26:17.995 --> 26:20.205
I think you are perfection.

26:20.205 --> 26:24.585
You're smart and beautiful,
and any boy would be so lucky to have you.

26:28.463 --> 26:30.299
- Actually, Mom, um...

26:31.508 --> 26:33.010
you know my friend, Lucy?

26:35.179 --> 26:37.014
She's not just my friend.

26:39.057 --> 26:40.225
We're together.

26:40.976 --> 26:44.605
- Oh... okay, um.

26:45.731 --> 26:49.526
Well, what does this mean exactly?
Are you bi?

26:50.152 --> 26:51.945
- I actually don't know yet.

26:53.697 --> 26:54.948
Are you okay?

26:54.948 --> 26:56.575
- Of course, I'm okay.

26:58.410 --> 27:01.288
Oh, wait!
This is actually so exciting

27:01.288 --> 27:03.540
because this is perfect
for your college essays.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.501
Finally, something that
makes you interesting.

27:05.501 --> 27:07.127
- Okay, Mom, you're doing it again.
- Okay, yes.

27:07.127 --> 27:08.879
