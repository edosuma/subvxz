00:03.738 --> 00:05.501
Don't visualize your parents
having sex.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.141
You know what I mean? It's somehow
very uncomfortable.

00:08.309 --> 00:12.939
You know they had to have sex
at least once to have you.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.708
But you still kind of maintain
the image in your head:

00:15.883 --> 00:19.250
"Well, I don't know. I'm not positive.
I can't prove it.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.217
I don't know if that
actually happened."

00:21.389 --> 00:24.415
That's why if I found I was adopted,
that would come as great news.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.991
"I'm adopted? That's great."

00:26.160 --> 00:28.492
I'd be happy to hear that.
That means technically...

00:28.663 --> 00:33.726
...it's possible, that my mother and
father are just really great friends.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.836
Sex is great, but you don't wanna
think your whole life began...

00:37.004 --> 00:39.632
...because somebody had a little
too much wine with dinner.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.937
Let me ask you a question.

00:48.683 --> 00:50.412
You're a hostage captured
by terrorists.

00:50.585 --> 00:52.485
- Who, me?
- You, anybody. Whatever.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.417
You're in the little room.
You're chained to the floor.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.319
You're there for a long time.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.755
Do you think they would consider
doing laundry?

00:59.927 --> 01:01.861
They have to.
It's in the Geneva Convention.

01:02.029 --> 01:04.827
You. Take off your socks
and pants. We're doing the wash.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.467
Come on. Take it off.
Take it off.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.627
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hi.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.202
What's the matter?

01:16.510 --> 01:17.977
My mother caught me.

01:18.813 --> 01:20.280
Caught you? Doing what?

01:20.548 --> 01:22.209
You know.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.753
I was alone...

01:28.689 --> 01:30.452
You mean...?

01:30.625 --> 01:32.650
- She caught you?
- Where?

01:33.894 --> 01:36.385
I stopped by the house
to drop the car off...

01:36.564 --> 01:38.429
...and I went inside
for a few minutes.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.726
Nobody was there.
They're supposed to be working.

01:41.836 --> 01:45.966
My mother had a Glamour magazine.
I started leafing through it.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.964
Glamour?

01:48.142 --> 01:52.203
- So one thing led to another.
- What did she do?

01:52.380 --> 01:56.248
First she screams, "George, what are
you doing? My God!"

01:57.351 --> 01:58.818
Looked like she was gonna faint.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.921
She started clutching the wall,
trying to hang onto it.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.990
I didn't know whether to keep her
from falling or zip up.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.054
- What did you do?
- I zipped up.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.094
- So she fell?
- Yeah.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.263
Well, I couldn't run over there
the way I was.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.925
- No, I guess you couldn't.
- I wouldn't think so.

02:16.103 --> 02:20.130
So she fell, and then she starts
screaming, "My back, my back!"

02:20.307 --> 02:22.275
I picked her up. I took her
to the hospital.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.877
- How is she?
- She's in traction.

02:26.047 --> 02:27.708
- I'm sorry.
- It's not funny, Elaine.

02:27.882 --> 02:30.578
I know. I'm sorry. It's serious.

02:30.751 --> 02:34.016
Her back went out. She's gotta be
there for a couple of days.

02:34.188 --> 02:39.125
All she said on the way over
in the car was, "Why, George, why?"

02:39.293 --> 02:41.784
I said, "Because it's there."

02:43.698 --> 02:45.188
Glamour?

02:47.268 --> 02:48.599
I'll tell you this, though:

02:48.769 --> 02:50.760
I am never doing...

02:50.938 --> 02:52.735
...that again.

02:52.907 --> 02:55.398
What? You mean in your mother's
house or altogether?

02:55.576 --> 02:58.044
- Altogether.
- Give me a break.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.770
Yeah, right.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.744
- You don't think I can?
- No chance.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.750
- You think you could?
- I could hold out longer than you.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.889
Care to make it interesting?

03:11.092 --> 03:12.423
Sure. How much?

03:12.593 --> 03:13.821
Hundred dollars?

03:13.994 --> 03:15.427
You're on.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.724
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Count me in on this.

03:18.999 --> 03:22.491
You? You'll be out before we
get the check.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.466
I want in on this.

03:25.639 --> 03:29.439
- No, no.
- It's apples and oranges.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.941
- It's different.
- Why? Why?

03:31.112 --> 03:32.773
- Because you're a woman.
- So what?

03:32.947 --> 03:36.747
It's easier for a woman not to do it
than a man. We have to do it.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.579
It's part of our lifestyle.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.145
It's like shaving.

03:42.523 --> 03:45.458
That is such baloney.
I shave my legs.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.991
Not every day.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.787
- You wanna be in?
- Yeah.

03:50.965 --> 03:54.128
You gotta give us odds.
At least 2-1. You gotta put up $200.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.360
No. A thousand.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.028
No. I'll put up 150.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.232
- All right. You're in for 150.
- Okay, 150.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.706
How we gonna monitor this?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.539
Obviously, we all know each
other very well.

04:06.714 --> 04:12.277
I'm sure we'll all feel comfortable within
the confines of the honor system.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.555
All right. Come on.

04:20.194 --> 04:24.426
No, Ma. I'm not gonna
see a psychiatrist.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.198
I don't care if you do pay for it.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.302
No. Discussion over.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.335
Yeah, all right. I'll see you later.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.167
Yes, of course I'm gonna come by.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.400
All right.

04:36.577 --> 04:39.478
My mother wants me
to see a psychiatrist now.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.741
Why? Because she caught me?

04:42.917 --> 04:47.251
You know, if everyone who did
that had to go see a psychiatrist...

04:52.026 --> 04:53.254
Yeah...?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.227
Whatever.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.298
- How is she?
- She'll be fine.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.059
I gotta go see her at the hospital.

05:02.236 --> 05:03.362
- Yeah?
- It's me.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.765
Come on up.

05:04.939 --> 05:07.669
- Hey, what are you doing tonight?
- Date with Marla.

05:07.842 --> 05:09.833
- Oh, the virgin?
- Yeah.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.579
Any progress there?
What's the latest?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.941
I got my troops amassed
along the border.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.413
I'm waiting for someone to give me
the go-ahead.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.113
Hey, look at this. Come here. There's
a naked woman across the street.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.156
Where?

05:23.324 --> 05:25.724
Second floor from the top.
See the window on the left?

05:26.460 --> 05:29.190
Who walks around
the house like that?

05:29.363 --> 05:32.196
Maybe she's a nudist. You know those
nudist-colony people.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.095
Yeah.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.633
Yeah.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.345 --> 05:46.370
Let me ask you,
in these nudist colonies...

05:46.547 --> 05:48.344
...do they eat naked
in the dining room?

05:48.515 --> 05:50.039
I would imagine it's all naked.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.946
Are the chambermaids naked too?

05:52.119 --> 05:55.054
They're naked. The gardener's naked.
Bellhops.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.247
It's one big nude-o-rama.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.289
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.987
Well, where's my money?
Who caved?

06:04.164 --> 06:05.961
- Not me.
- Not me.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.931
- What are you looking at?
- A naked woman across the street.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.667
This is gonna be the easiest
money I've ever made in my life.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.137
My friend Joyce is teaching an
aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.

06:17.311 --> 06:20.178
Yeah, well, the waitress
should've taken it back.

06:26.453 --> 06:30.321
Then, I got a call this morning. I was
chosen to go on the space shuttle.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.389
- We're going to Mars.
- Have a good time.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.156
I'm out.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.602
What?

06:54.048 --> 06:56.778
Yeah, I'm out.
I'm out of the contest.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.612
- You're out?
- Yeah.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.278
Wow, that was fast.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.118
Well, it was that woman
across the street.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.284
You know, you better be careful,
buddy. She'll get you next.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.532
And then there were three.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.002
I don't understand you. I really don't.

07:21.241 --> 07:25.701
You have nothing better to do
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

07:27.214 --> 07:29.079
I go out for a quart of milk.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.843
I come home and find
my son treating his body...

07:32.019 --> 07:34.419
...like it was an amusement park.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.384
Ma...

07:37.558 --> 07:40.186
Don't give me "Ma." It's good
I didn't hit the table.

07:40.361 --> 07:42.329
I could have cracked my head open.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.664
People can hear you.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.697
Too bad you can't do that
for a living.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.835
You'd be very successful at it.

07:53.007 --> 07:55.840
You could sell out
Madison Square Garden.

07:56.010 --> 07:58.240
Thousands of people
could watch you.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.346
You could be a big star.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.744
All right. That's enough.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.508
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.710
No! I am not going
to see a psychiatrist!

08:06.887 --> 08:09.355
- Why not? Why won't you go?
- Because I don't want to.

08:09.957 --> 08:13.654
- I want you to go see somebody.
- Well, I am not going.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.727
It's a good thing
your father's in Chicago.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.194
Hello, Aunt Estelle.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.593
Look at you.

08:19.767 --> 08:23.168
- How did this happen?
- Is that important, really?

08:23.337 --> 08:26.101
What is this, a police investigation?
She's been through enough.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.900
She has to relive the experience?

08:28.876 --> 08:31.310
Hi, Denise. 6:30, time for
your sponge bath.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.875
Is it 6:30 already? I fell asleep.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.018
So, George...

08:43.624 --> 08:45.592
...what are you doing now?

08:45.759 --> 08:50.093
I hear you got some kind of
television writing thing.

08:50.264 --> 08:51.629
Yeah. Television.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.859
Let me help you off with that.
Here, just slip it over your head.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.232
Well, it's about time.

08:58.405 --> 09:02.273
We thought you were gonna
wind up on the street.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.836
So...

09:08.015 --> 09:11.212
...what is it you're doing, exactly?

09:14.254 --> 09:17.781
George, your cousin Shelly
is talking to you!

09:22.863 --> 09:25.457
So when was the last time
you took a class?

09:25.632 --> 09:27.759
- It's been a while.
- Are you psyched?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.632
Yeah. I'm really psyched.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.795
You're gonna thank me
for getting you in here.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.271
- Why is that?
- See the guy with the dark hair...

09:35.442 --> 09:37.672
...and the red shorts?

09:38.779 --> 09:40.440
Oh, my God.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.775
John F. Kennedy Jr. is here.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.612
- He's gonna be in your class today.
- In my class?

09:45.786 --> 09:47.344
John Kennedy's gonna
be in my class?

09:47.521 --> 09:49.682
I can get you a spot
right behind him.

09:49.857 --> 09:52.325
He has got a great butt.

09:52.493 --> 09:56.862
Yeah. Butt, butt.
Great butt. John-John's butt.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.159
- Let's slow it down a little.
- Slow it down?

10:04.338 --> 10:06.533
Well, you know.

10:06.707 --> 10:09.505
Yeah. I know.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.937
You're okay with that, right?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.546
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.742
You think I care about the sex? What
kind of person do you think I am?

10:18.919 --> 10:21.649
That doesn't mean anything to me.
I don't care about that.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.449
I'll see you Saturday night, then?

10:23.624 --> 10:25.558
Sure. Saturday night.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.820
- All right, then. Good night.
- Good night.

10:29.363 --> 10:30.591
Not just a good night.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.028
A great night.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.794
Good morning.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.890
Yeah, good morning.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.399
Nothing like some good,
solid sack-time.

11:09.570 --> 11:11.060
She's not there.

11:11.238 --> 11:12.796
She's doing her wash.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.703
So did you make it
through the night?

11:16.476 --> 11:18.706
Yes, I'm proud to say I did.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.344
So you're still master
of your domain.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.710
Yes. Yes, I am.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.079
Master of my domain.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.220
But I will tell you this:

11:28.388 --> 11:30.117
I am going over to her apartment...

11:30.290 --> 11:32.622
...and I'm telling her to put
those shades down.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.260
Wait. What did you just say?

11:34.428 --> 11:36.453
I can't take it anymore.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.359
She's driving me crazy.
I can't sleep.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.760
I can't leave the house.
I'm climbing walls.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.799
I'm dating a virgin,
I'm in this contest.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.063
Something's gotta give.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.641
Do you hear what you're saying?
Can you hear it?

11:50.811 --> 11:52.972
This is a beautiful woman
walking around naked...

11:53.146 --> 11:54.738
...and you wanna tell her to stop?

11:54.915 --> 11:57.475
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard!

11:57.651 --> 11:59.482
It's incomprehensible...
I won't let you.

11:59.653 --> 12:02.247
- I'm doing it. Get out of my way.
- No, no. You can't.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.357
This is something that comes about
once in a lifetime.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.789
When we were boys looking through
our windows...

12:07.961 --> 12:11.089
...we'd think, "Why can't a woman
out there take her clothes off?"

12:11.265 --> 12:14.132
Now that wish has come true,
and you wanna throw it away?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.199
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not gonna let you do it.

12:17.371 --> 12:19.305
- Kramer, get out of my way.
- Don't do it.

12:19.473 --> 12:23.136
For my sake. God knows,
I don't ask you for much.

12:23.310 --> 12:27.713
Please, Jerry. I'm begging you.
Please! Come on! Please!

12:32.019 --> 12:33.919
- All right, all right.
- Yes!

12:34.788 --> 12:36.949
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.048
She's not there.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.559
Oh, I can wait.

12:45.232 --> 12:48.827
The nurse was giving her
a sponge bath?

12:49.002 --> 12:51.869
Every night at 6:30.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.802
The nurse was gorgeous.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.272
Then I got a look at the patient.

12:56.510 --> 12:57.738
I was going nuts.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.337
I guess you'll be going back
to that hospital.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.416
Well, my mother, Jerry.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.517
But are you still
master of your domain?

13:08.588 --> 13:11.455
I am king of the county.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.718
- You?
- Lord of the manor.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.529
John F. Kennedy Jr.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.463
What?

13:23.637 --> 13:26.003
He was in my aerobics class.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.141
Really? Did you talk to him?

13:28.308 --> 13:32.972
No, you don't understand.
He was working out in front of me.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.740
After the class was over,
I timed my walk to the door...

13:35.916 --> 13:38.043
...so we'd get there
at the exact same moment.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.517
And he says to me,
"Quite a workout."

13:41.688 --> 13:43.656
"Quite a workout"?

13:43.824 --> 13:46.691
- What did you say?
- I said, "Yeah."

13:47.561 --> 13:48.789
Good one.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.759
Listen, listen. Then I showered,
and I dressed...

13:51.932 --> 13:53.866
...and I saw him again
on the way out.

13:54.034 --> 13:57.834
So we're walking and talking,
and he asked me my name...

13:58.004 --> 14:01.132
...and I think I said Elaine,
but I mean, who the hell knows?

14:02.309 --> 14:04.300
So then he says to me:

14:04.478 --> 14:08.778
"Do you wanna split
a cab uptown?"

14:09.249 --> 14:12.241
And I said, "Sure," even though
I was going downtown.

14:12.419 --> 14:17.789
So we get in the cab, and I mean,
I have no idea where I'm going, right?

14:17.958 --> 14:21.291
But this is John F. Kennedy Jr.
we're talking about.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.053
So he says, "Where do you live?"

14:23.230 --> 14:25.630
I was close to your block,
so I said your building.

14:25.799 --> 14:27.289
He dropped me off in front...

14:27.467 --> 14:31.767
...and then I had to take a cab all
the way back downtown to my house.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.533
Oh, God.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.641
The question is...

14:36.176 --> 14:38.371
...are you still master
of your domain?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.840
I'm queen of the castle.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.750
You're back.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.552
Of course I'm back.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.285
Why wouldn't I be back?

14:55.462 --> 14:58.556
My mother is in the hospital.
I'm gonna pay her a visit.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.064
I know, but two days in a row?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.792
You didn't have to do this.

15:02.969 --> 15:06.928
You're my mother.
What wouldn't I do for you?

15:07.107 --> 15:08.335
You know what you could do?

15:08.508 --> 15:10.840
I haven't eaten lunch or dinner.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.275
I can't eat this hospital food.

15:13.447 --> 15:16.939
Maybe you could run down to the deli
and get me a sandwich.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.384
You got it, Ma.

15:19.553 --> 15:21.282
A little later.

15:23.857 --> 15:27.054
Could you go now, Georgie?
I'm very hungry. I'm weak.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.990
Wait a while. What's the difference?

15:29.162 --> 15:32.495
I don't understand why
you can't do this for me!

15:32.666 --> 15:35.658
I just got here, Ma. I'd like to spend
a little time with you.

15:35.836 --> 15:37.929
But if you wait, they won't
let you back in!

15:38.104 --> 15:40.129
Visiting hours are almost over!

15:40.307 --> 15:43.970
Ten minutes. Here.
Have some Tic Tacs.

15:45.679 --> 15:48.045
Get the hell out of here.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.012
I'm sorry you came.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.175
6:30. Time for your bath.

15:58.258 --> 16:02.456
George. I'm hungry.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.964
Hang on, Ma. Hang on.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.840
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.532
Did you get your hair done today?

16:17.177 --> 16:21.045
No, I just fixed it a little bit.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.205
You-know-who isn't here.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.544
He was in the early class today,
but I think...

16:25.719 --> 16:28.210
...you made quite an impression
on him yesterday.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.879
What? What? Who? Me?

16:31.057 --> 16:32.957
- What impression?
- Let me put this back.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.924
No, no, now! Tell me now!
What did he say?

16:36.096 --> 16:37.996
- He asked about you.
- He asked about me?

16:38.164 --> 16:40.530
John Kennedy asked about me?
What did he say?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.258
He wanted to know your situation.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.801
- What? I have a situation?
- I said you were single.

16:44.971 --> 16:48.134
- That was good. That was very good.
- He said you were just his type.

16:48.308 --> 16:52.608
Okay. You're trying to hurt me?
You're trying to injure me?

16:52.779 --> 16:56.738
He told me to tell you he'll be in your
neighborhood tomorrow around 9:00.

16:56.917 --> 17:00.580
He'll stop in front of your building if
you wanna come down and say hello.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.487
All right, Ma.
I'll talk to you later.

17:07.661 --> 17:12.394
Nothing. I'm watching
Tiny Toons here on Nickelodeon.

17:12.566 --> 17:16.002
I like kids' shows. They have a very
innocent, wholesome quality.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.660
Okay. All right, talk to you later. Bye.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.771
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
That's very, very good.

17:22.943 --> 17:24.968
It's hot in there, so just walk around.

17:25.145 --> 17:28.979
Yeah. Don't be ashamed.
Don't be ashamed. That's good.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.117
Yes, yes, yes.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.420
The woman across the block
Has nothing on

17:38.592 --> 17:40.150
Nothing on, nothing on

17:40.327 --> 17:43.455
The woman across the block
Has nothing on, nothing on

17:43.630 --> 17:44.790
All through the day

18:01.314 --> 18:05.375
All you got is instant coffee?
Why don't you get some real coffee?

18:05.552 --> 18:09.545
I don't keep real coffee here.
I get my coffee on the outside.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.154
Yeah!

18:12.325 --> 18:14.759
- It's Elaine.
- Come on up!

18:15.328 --> 18:17.762
- Where did you get those socks?
- I don't know.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.489
- I think those are my socks.
- How are these your socks?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.464
I don't know, but those are my socks.

18:22.636 --> 18:26.163
I had a blue-striped pair just like that,
and now I don't have them anymore.

18:26.339 --> 18:30.036
Yeah, you fell asleep on the sofa,
and I took them off your stinking feet!

18:30.210 --> 18:32.144
They looked so good,
I had to have them!

18:32.312 --> 18:34.644
- Well, they're my socks!
- They're my socks!

18:36.182 --> 18:38.309
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
- What are we doing here?

18:38.485 --> 18:41.181
- This is ridiculous.
- You believe this? We're fighting.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.584
I haven't been myself.
I've snapped at everybody.

18:43.757 --> 18:45.657
I'm yelling at strangers
on the street.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.857
Hello.

18:58.538 --> 18:59.766
You caved?

18:59.939 --> 19:02.237
- It's over?
- You're out?

19:02.409 --> 19:06.709
Oh, my God.
The queen is dead.

19:07.547 --> 19:11.176
I figured you'd cruise,
at least through the spring.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.120
- What happened?
- It was...

19:14.854 --> 19:16.082
...John-John.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.225
- John-John.
- John-John.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.088
But you made it through
the day before.

19:22.262 --> 19:27.290
But he told Joyce that he wants to
meet me outside here at 9:00 tonight.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.061
- Why outside here?
- Because he thinks I live here.

19:30.236 --> 19:33.262
Remember the cab? He dropped me off
out front. He's picking me up.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.933
All right, Costanza...

19:36.109 --> 19:37.337
...it's you and me.

19:37.544 --> 19:41.139
And then, there were two.

19:42.248 --> 19:44.239
Elaine Benes...

19:44.417 --> 19:47.113
...Kennedy Jr.

19:55.829 --> 19:57.228
Let's go in the bedroom.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.456
- Really?
- Yes.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.532
- You sure?
- Yes.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.636
- You really want to?
- I do. I'm ready.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.199
Okay.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.465
I know how difficult this
must have been for you.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.405
You don't know the half of it.

20:13.346 --> 20:16.713
- What do you mean?
- It's kind of silly, but...

20:22.789 --> 20:24.950
Contest? A contest?

20:25.125 --> 20:27.150
This is what you do
with your friends?

20:27.327 --> 20:30.353
It was just a bet. It actually started
with George and his mother.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.794
I don't wanna hear
another word!

20:32.966 --> 20:35.958
To think how close I came to you
being the one!

20:36.136 --> 20:38.661
I must have been out of my mind.

20:52.886 --> 20:54.114
Marla.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.278
Hi.
I'm glad I ran into you.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.789
I don't wanna have anything to do
with you or your perverted friends.

21:01.227 --> 21:05.561
Get away from me.
You're horrible, horrible. All of you.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.536
- What happened?
- I told her about the contest.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.695
Boy. She's a wacko.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.307
- Hey, what happened?
- What?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.341
- You were meeting Kennedy.
- He didn't show.

21:18.511 --> 21:19.773
Yeah, he did.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.005
What? He's out there?

21:22.182 --> 21:24.650
- Oh, my God. I gotta go.
- No, no, he just left.

21:25.418 --> 21:28.182
- What?
- He was talking to Marla.

21:28.354 --> 21:29.616
Marla?

21:29.789 --> 21:32.781
She was, like, crying.
He was consoling her.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.826
She got into his car,
and they just drove away.

21:37.163 --> 21:41.099
- He left with Marla, the virgin?
- Yeah.

21:41.568 --> 21:44.036
- They drove away?
- Yeah, drove away.

21:44.204 --> 21:49.870
- You know, I said hello to him. He's...
- Oh, my God in heaven.

21:52.212 --> 21:54.305
Is that...?

21:54.480 --> 21:56.380
Kramer?

22:01.454 --> 22:03.649
He's waving.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.602
Oh, John...

22:24.777 --> 22:27.507
...that was wonderful.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.658
Men wanna see women naked.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.589
Whatever it is you won't show us...

22:41.761 --> 22:44.093
...that's what we're obsessed
with seeing.

22:44.264 --> 22:47.665
If women always wore hats in public,
all the time...

22:47.834 --> 22:49.802
...you'd see men buying
Playhead magazine...

22:49.969 --> 22:52.301
...you know, Skulls of the Big 10.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.667
This would be what we're
interested in.

22:54.841 --> 22:57.105
What about cultures, like in
National Geographic...

22:57.310 --> 22:59.335
...where everybody is naked?

22:59.512 --> 23:02.948
What are men in these cultures trying
to look at when the women walk by?

23:03.116 --> 23:04.913
How could you have a strip
club there?

23:05.084 --> 23:08.952
Woman takes off the necklace and
the nose ring, that's it, show's over.

23:10.056 --> 23:13.548
The men are going, "Boy, did you see
that little indentation in her lip?

23:13.726 --> 23:15.887
I told you, man, this place is hot!"
