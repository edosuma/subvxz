00:01.359 --> 00:03.931
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.000 --> 00:06.685
Tell us about Cybertek
and the Deathlok Program.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.922
- Mike Peterson's alive.
- They did something to him.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.731
GH-325.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.485
Agent Coulson was injected with it
and literally minutes later,

00:15.560 --> 00:17.767
his wounds showed signs
of cellular regeneration.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.491
Fury went to dangerous lengths
to keep this under wraps.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.369
We can't share this with anyone.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.410
For their safety and ours.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.641
Encrypted line secure.

00:26.720 --> 00:29.166
Agent Melinda May.
Update log 93.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.571
Coulson knows.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.522
- Agent John Garrett, confirm.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.251
Agent Antoine Triplett, confirmed.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.687
Well, it's no Four Seasons.

00:48.760 --> 00:51.445
As far as safe houses go, it's not bad.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.409
Phuket didn't even have mattresses.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.960
Yeah, but Cairo had
1,000-thread-count sheets.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.883
With that sateen finish.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.406
- Hey, be careful what you get used to.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.531
Dig out that sat phone,
get Coulson on the line.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.490
I wanna run down through the list
of potential candidates with him.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.688
You really think The Clairvoyant
was on the Index?

01:09.760 --> 01:13.162
Rejected off the Index. Possibly.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.050
Just hope it's not the Amazing Kreskin.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.327
- I used to love that guy.
-Who?

01:18.400 --> 01:19.890
- Area three breach.

01:28.720 --> 01:29.801
Ahh!

01:29.880 --> 01:31.928
Hit him with the ICER!

02:19.440 --> 02:21.044
You realize, Agent Coulson,
they have these things

02:21.160 --> 02:22.730
called teleconferences now.

02:22.800 --> 02:23.961
Nice to see you, too, Agent Hand.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.083
Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.322
Little unconventional meeting this way,
isn't it?

02:28.400 --> 02:29.367
From the reports I've read,

02:29.440 --> 02:31.886
"Unconventional" seems to be
Coulson's middle name these days.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.928
Fight breaks out, let me take Blake.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.331
He's coy, but scrappy.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.007
I'll explain everything as soon as
we hit 50,000 feet. This way.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.290
Cruising altitude reached,

02:48.360 --> 02:50.806
bearing 90 degrees
just over the North Pole.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.882
- Thank you.
-Apologies for the song and dance.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.485
We brought you here as a precaution.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.800
A precaution against what?

02:55.880 --> 02:57.450
The Clairvoyant.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.329
If there is someone out there
who can read minds,

02:59.400 --> 03:01.971
at least up here
we're as far away from him as possible.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.690
Think that maybe the northern lights
will knock a few bars

03:03.760 --> 03:05.000
off his psychic Wi-Fi.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.691
Coulson, you know S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
stance on psychics.

03:06.760 --> 03:07.886
They don't exist.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.451
Are you suddenly a believer?

03:09.520 --> 03:11.204
Not definitively.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.930
But I had a recent experience
with an Asgardian

03:13.000 --> 03:15.002
who could bend people's will
with her voice.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.481
Forced me to open my mind,
so to speak.

03:17.560 --> 03:20.211
All we know for sure is The
Clairvoyant's been a step ahead of us,

03:20.280 --> 03:22.089
stealing plays from our playbook.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.326
And it's pissing me off.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.200
I take it you've all read
Agent Garrett's latest report?

03:26.280 --> 03:29.011
The hit on the safe house.
Mr. Peterson's alive and kicking.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.765
- We call him Deathlok.
-That was the project's codename.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.571
Agent Garrett and I have been
tracking him the last few weeks.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.166
And we think The Clairvoyant's
super-soldier bodyguard

03:37.240 --> 03:40.289
came after us for a reason.
We're getting close.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.964
To what? His identity?

03:44.800 --> 03:47.007
We've narrowed the list
to 13 candidates.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.610
Narrowed it how? From what?

03:49.320 --> 03:50.765
Agent Garrett has been taking
a second look

03:50.840 --> 03:51.841
at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s gifted Index.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.610
Specifically the rejects.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.284
Individuals S.H.I.E.L.D. interviewed
who are believed

03:55.360 --> 03:57.931
to have psychic abilities,
but were ultimately dismissed.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.441
So you think we've encountered
The Clairvoyant before?

04:00.800 --> 04:02.962
Think how many cases we've
encountered across the globe,

04:03.400 --> 04:04.686
how many cases we've vetted,

04:05.120 --> 04:06.804
it's more than possible, it's probable.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.201
I need more coffee.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.210
Let's assume what you're saying
is possible, what then?

04:11.720 --> 04:13.643
If we're going up against
a natural clairvoyant,

04:13.720 --> 04:15.210
how do you suggest we combat that?

04:15.640 --> 04:17.642
By compartmentalizing the information.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.168
A member of my team is an expert
at pattern recognition and analysis.

04:21.279 --> 04:22.850
Finding needles in haystacks.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.202
She'll prioritize the candidates
on Garrett's list,

04:25.440 --> 04:28.091
locate them, then pair us off
into random teams.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.244
That way only one person knows
the full scope of the mission.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.040
You do understand that this person
you're referring to,

04:35.160 --> 04:37.891
she'd need to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent
to be granted that level of access.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.887
I'm glad you brought that up.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.088
Guys, I swear, I am fine.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.322
How much blood are you going to draw
before you believe me?

04:45.400 --> 04:48.131
Your recovery,
it's honestly quite unbelievable.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.201
Strange.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.362
We know Coulson had
a very different recovery experience.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.771
So we understand why he's hesitant

04:52.840 --> 04:54.922
about us sharing
our findings with others.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.128
Yeah, but something like this drug,
it needs to be studied.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.165
It has the potential
to save so many lives.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.163
We'd like to send a blood sample
of yours to some colleagues

05:01.240 --> 05:02.890
to do a molecular breakdown.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.929
Maybe if you spoke to Agent Coulson...

05:05.000 --> 05:06.411
I don't think that's a good idea.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.486
If Coulson thinks it's important
that this stay between us,

05:09.560 --> 05:12.450
then we should trust him, right?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.401
He's the boss.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.726
So you're saying
we should obey the rules?

05:20.400 --> 05:22.050
Who are you
and what have you done with Skye?

05:22.800 --> 05:26.202
Skye. Upstairs.
Top brass wants to see you.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.890
Pairing off makes total sense.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.847
Just one thought though.
What if we make it a double-blind?

05:35.920 --> 05:36.967
How so?

05:37.040 --> 05:38.326
Well, I'll give one person
from each team

05:38.440 --> 05:40.249
the potential Clairvoyant's coordinates,

05:40.360 --> 05:41.930
and I'll give the other one the identity.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.161
That way no one person knows

05:43.280 --> 05:45.647
the full specs of the op
until you get there.

05:46.160 --> 05:49.881
I like how you think.
I like how she thinks.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.884
One question. How am I supposed
to access all the classified files

05:52.960 --> 05:54.166
without someone in the room?

05:54.240 --> 05:55.446
I don't have clearance.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.965
Now you do.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.123
Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D., Skye.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.050
I told them to come up.

06:17.840 --> 06:18.841
I...

06:19.240 --> 06:21.129
I don't know what to say.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.847
- Thank you.
-Don't thank me.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.810
You've passed every required
S.H.I.E.L.D. exam with flying colors.

06:27.880 --> 06:28.961
For a Level 1 agent.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.042
You've assisted us
on multiple field missions,

06:31.160 --> 06:32.207
put your life on the line.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.050
You earned this.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.688
Hell, you took two in the gut.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.410
More than Sitwell here's ever done.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.007
Okay, everyone, back to work.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.369
Congratulations.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.249
- Congratulations, Skye!
-Thank you!

06:52.320 --> 06:53.731
Congratulations.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.367
Couldn't have done it without
a great and very patient S.O.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.521
Yeah, you could've.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.561
I'm no clairvoyant,

07:06.640 --> 07:08.927
but I do believe some things
are meant to be.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.203
Can't say I'm a fan
of this double-blind situation.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.645
How will the field teams
meet us at the destinations?

08:41.720 --> 08:42.721
They won't.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.370
They'll be on standby.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.409
We can't risk The Clairvoyant
knowing we're coming.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.527
What you're saying is
one of these teams

08:47.600 --> 08:48.726
could be heading straight
into an ambush,

08:48.840 --> 08:49.887
without backup.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.965
Agent Sitwell, we've just received word
from the Triskelion.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.441
You have orders to report
to the Lemurian Star immediately.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.045
So I assume you'll take his place?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.088
In your hunt for Santa Claus? No.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.051
I'm taking a transport jet
back to the Hub

09:01.120 --> 09:03.646
where I can quarterback
the field teams via satellite.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.365
Someone's gonna have to pull
your asses out of the fire

09:05.480 --> 09:06.925
when things go south.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.411
I'll be in touch.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.410
I guess I got a boat to catch.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.851
- Good luck, Agent Coulson.
-You, too, Agent Sitwell.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.841
Okay.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.400
On this phone, you will find
a set of coordinates

09:23.480 --> 09:26.006
that'll lead you to one of the three
potential Clairvoyants I've chosen.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.766
When you're within a mile,

09:27.840 --> 09:30.241
your partner will be granted access
to the candidate's name

09:30.320 --> 09:32.209
and profile on their own phone.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.647
Makes sense?

09:34.640 --> 09:37.928
You know, we haven't officially met.
John Garrett.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.761
I guess lying unconscious on a gurney
really should not count.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.764
How're you feeling?

09:44.840 --> 09:47.127
A lot better, actually.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.529
I've been shot a couple times myself.
Back, shoulder.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.330
Had my throat cut once.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.490
But you know the toughest one?

09:59.160 --> 10:00.571
Thing about a third-degree burn,

10:01.600 --> 10:04.410
the burn itself doesn't hurt at all.
Crazy, right?

10:04.480 --> 10:06.209
The nerve endings get all fried.

10:06.280 --> 10:10.683
But the area around the burn?
That smarts.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.889
Still, gut shot's the worst.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.401
Sir, I know what you did for me.

10:17.480 --> 10:21.644
How you risked your life
to save me. So, thank you.

10:23.480 --> 10:27.644
You got a good team around you.
I just jumped on the bandwagon.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.768
Well, you trained one of them, sir.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.681
Guess it all comes full circle.

10:32.760 --> 10:36.207
Ward's your S.O. I was his.
Turn, turn, turn.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.888
But this S.O. thing goes both ways.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.209
You've had a big impact on him.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.648
He's different than I remember him.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.801
Different how?

10:45.880 --> 10:48.531
Well, the tough thing
about being a specialist is being alone.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.126
A team gives you
a whole new perspective.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.407
Guess it's the difference between
fighting against something

10:53.480 --> 10:56.609
and fighting for something.
Or someone.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.128
Ward's got that now.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.731
Thanks for this.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.246
And, Skye, lose the "sir."

11:10.600 --> 11:14.161
I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, just like you.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.806
What's this?

11:19.880 --> 11:22.087
Say you need to tag
a fleeing vehicle, or a wild monkey,

11:22.200 --> 11:23.531
if it was to get away from you.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.728
These rounds are built
with a micro-receiver,

11:25.800 --> 11:28.565
which enables you to track
your target via satellite.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.924
I've condensed all the blood sample
results into an encrypted file.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.924
- Now, if we just had access...
-Jemma, we have a visitor.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.601
Oh!

11:37.680 --> 11:39.409
May. Hello.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.448
I assume you're talking
about Skye's blood.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.083
There's just so much we don't know.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.401
- The GH-325.
-325.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.682
I mean, we don't know what drug it is,
where it came from.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.684
Yeah, not to mention any potential
side effects, short or long-term.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.003
We're just worried about Skye,
and Agent Coulson, of course.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.923
Have either of them exhibited

11:59.000 --> 12:01.731
any side effects or strange behavior?

12:01.800 --> 12:04.610
-"Strange" is such a subjective term.
-No more than usual.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.924
Because if they have,
or if they do in the future,

12:09.040 --> 12:12.522
feel free to contact me first.
I can help. Okay?

12:20.760 --> 12:22.569
Okay. You're all set.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.531
Hope you paired me with someone
good. Or interesting, at least.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.049
Stop worrying-

12:30.120 --> 12:33.567
You wear your heart
on your sleeve, and your face.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.926
I trust your judgment.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.561
The way you see the world,
it's different than the rest of us.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.483
That's why I want you
to dig deeper into these.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.642
The candidates' psych evaluations?

12:42.720 --> 12:45.166
The Clairvoyant thinks
he can read our minds.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.571
See if you can read his.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.608
We need some insight
into who this person really is.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.170
A weakness.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.528
So, do what you do. Find the exploit.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.690
And stop worrying.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.570
So Garrett says your family's
like the cable version of the Kennedys.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.364
Huh! I doubt he said that.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.244
Fine.
I did my own research.

13:15.320 --> 13:18.085
Had to,
following in golden boy's footsteps.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.084
- There a point to this?
-Just trying to keep things light.

13:21.160 --> 13:24.369
-'Cause that's what we all need?
-You know, maybe it is.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.881
You wanna keep it light?

13:25.960 --> 13:28.281
- The Clairvoyant almost killed Skye.
-Yeah?

13:28.400 --> 13:31.768
Well, he did kill my partner.
Dan Monroe.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.604
Great guy, had a son.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.648
You know what it's like telling
a 6-year-old

13:35.720 --> 13:37.961
that his dad isn't coming home?

13:38.040 --> 13:41.249
So we find The Clairvoyant,
you might want to stay out of my way.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.488
We all got axes to grind.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.642
We're here to take him in. Not out.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.242
Ask yourself something, Agent Ward.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.005
If Skye hadn't made it,
what would you be thinking right now?

13:57.000 --> 14:00.209
Elijah Fordham, 32,
military background. Here.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.649
Serving 18 life sentences
for a killing spree in the '90s.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.209
Sounds more psycho than psychic.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.080
Are you a Scorpio?

14:13.840 --> 14:18.289
It's just, wondering why our newest
agent paired the two of us together.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.522
Must have thought we were compatible
in some way.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.647
It was random, Blake.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.890
You seem like a Scorpio.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.324
You don't believe in The Clairvoyant,
but you believe in astrology.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.848
I have some theories of my own.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.122
Please tell me we're here
for one of the doctors.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.610
So I dropped down through the skylight,
used up my whole mag,

14:40.680 --> 14:42.967
and hit the final guy right in the chest
with a flare gun.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.691
Boy, you should've seen
the look on his face

14:45.760 --> 14:47.888
when that thing went off.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.042
What? I already told you that one?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.009
- I was there.
-For which part?

14:52.120 --> 14:54.088
- The whole thing.
-Really?

14:55.360 --> 14:57.044
Damn, I must be getting old.

14:57.840 --> 15:00.161
Either that, or I drank a lot more
in my 30s than I remember.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.891
Or both.
You didn't go through the skylight.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.724
I know, but it makes for a better story.

15:07.120 --> 15:10.806
File came in.
Noriko Sato, 19, junior at Ball State.

15:11.680 --> 15:15.002
The co-ed, I remember.
She's got an IQ over 200.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.410
Ran circles around every agent
we sent in to interrogate her.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.728
Gave no indication she was gifted.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.925
- Family's got ties to the Yakuza, though.
-Heads up.

15:26.720 --> 15:27.846
Detour.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.486
Imagine that.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.286
"Thomas Nash.
Injured in a head-on collision."

15:34.360 --> 15:36.442
He's been catatonic
for the past four years.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.568
Great. We're here for a vegetable.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.486
I'll find the director's office,
you get a room number on Nash.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.041
Yes, ma'am.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.606
Nobody home. Odd.

16:03.880 --> 16:04.881
Oh!

16:05.440 --> 16:06.646
Convenient timing.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.368
Think this will make
a good story some day?

16:11.920 --> 16:14.651
Ah! One behind us. You better hope so.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.926
Mr. Peterson. Stop.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.287
You have a son. Ace.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.481
He needs you.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.244
We can still help you, Mike.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.284
Mike Peterson's dead.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.920
May to Hub. Deathlok's here.
Blake's down.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.128
All backup teams, move in.
We have an agent down. Repeat,

17:14.359 --> 17:15.599
Agent Blake is down.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.682
Lucky the med team got to him
when they did.

17:43.760 --> 17:47.287
I wouldn't call anyone
in critical condition "lucky."

17:49.320 --> 17:51.049
Deathlok's more dangerous
than we thought.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.521
Blake fired six shots,
didn't seem to faze him.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.443
Any word on Thomas Nash?

17:55.520 --> 17:56.851
No. He's a ghost.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.322
The facility has him listed as a resident,
but it's all a cover-up.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.563
Nash is probably off fishing
in Bora Bora right now, laughing at us.

18:03.640 --> 18:07.247
And yet Mr. Peterson was waiting
for you and Blake at the facility. Why?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.084
Probably same reason
he came after Garrett.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.481
We're getting too close.
He's trying to take us out.

18:11.560 --> 18:12.766
This shouldn't have happened.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.686
Backup should've been there
alongside Agents Blake and May.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.046
The Clairvoyant would've seen
us coming.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.851
It appears he did anyway.
The plan was flawed from the start.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.410
Come on, Vic, the plan was solid.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.766
We have an agent down
because we weren't prepared...

18:22.840 --> 18:24.126
Blake knew the risks.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.440
Then don't call me Vic.
It's condescending.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.887
Any one of us could've been ambushed.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.241
The point is, Blake's alive.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.210
And we have a suspect. Thomas Nash.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.524
I'm headed inside
to prep the field teams.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.844
Agent Coulson, when can I expect
Agent Simmons for debrief?

18:39.920 --> 18:41.649
- She's getting ready as we speak.
-Good.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.484
If I'm gonna put any more agents
in danger,

18:43.600 --> 18:45.443
I want them to know exactly
what Deathlok is,

18:45.560 --> 18:47.210
and what he's capable of.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.805
Honestly, I don't know how much more
you can tell them.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.211
Who knows what else
they've done to the man?

18:54.320 --> 18:56.368
Or how much man is left at all.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.128
Regardless, S.H.I.E.L.D. sees us
as the resident experts

19:00.240 --> 19:01.844
on the Deathlok Program.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.924
If they want me to stay here
at the Hub, then that's that.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.681
Well, don't you seem awfully chipper

19:06.760 --> 19:08.444
to pick up and leave me
by my lonesome.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.569
- Do I?
-Yes.

19:11.440 --> 19:15.001
And I wonder, could it be because
the Hub's lab facilities

19:15.080 --> 19:16.923
are much more comprehensive
than ours?

19:17.000 --> 19:20.243
In case I'd like to run a molecular
breakdown of Skye's blood?

19:21.320 --> 19:23.891
Yes, brilliant deduction, Dr. Watson.

19:25.640 --> 19:26.801
I've always pictured you as Watson.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.648
Either way, if you're gonna do this,

19:29.720 --> 19:31.484
you're gonna need my help,

19:31.560 --> 19:33.767
at some point,
one way or another, eventually.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.205
I wouldn't go that far.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.362
I'll jerry up an encrypted hardline
so we can stay in touch.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.808
Don't want the rest of the bosses
overhearing what we're saying.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.927
You ready to go?

19:43.560 --> 19:47.246
Agent Triplett.
Are you staying at the Hub as well?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.243
Yeah. Garrett's keeping me here.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.927
Help brief the teams on our most recent
run-in with the cyber-soldier.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.447
- Don't mind the company, do you?
-No. Not at all.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.764
According to Index archives,

20:00.840 --> 20:03.446
Nash has been on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
for about six years.

20:03.680 --> 20:07.048
Originally a bond trader in Canada,
doing very well for himself.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.130
Then the Canadian government
recruited him

20:09.200 --> 20:11.168
to a secret Department H-type program.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.288
They were looking for people
with psychic abilities.

20:13.360 --> 20:16.807
Specifically, people who could
control human behavior.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.451
- Nash claimed he had a gift.
-Claimed?

20:19.520 --> 20:22.649
According to records,
he couldn't affect a person's behavior,

20:22.720 --> 20:25.200
but he could, on occasion, predict it.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.726
But S.H.I.E.L.D. crossed him off
the Index after his accident

20:27.800 --> 20:29.962
because of his supposed
catatonic state.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.287
Which he recovered from quite nicely.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.646
It was all a lie.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.688
Just to throw S.H.I.E.L.D. off his scent.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.405
You said Blake fired how many rounds?

20:37.480 --> 20:39.926
I heard six. Why?

20:40.000 --> 20:43.925
Because there are only five
missing from this magazine.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.407
And one from here.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.124
These are Fitz's tag rounds.

20:51.440 --> 20:52.726
We can track him.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.643
Skye, check all the sat feeds.
Find that signal.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.485
- On it.
-I'll get us in the air.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.085
Nicely done, Blake.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.440
I want this perimeter sealed.

21:16.520 --> 21:17.965
Two men teams
on every exit.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.371
- Yes, sir.
- Fitz, you got a signal?

21:19.440 --> 21:22.171
94%, sir.
Deathlok must be inside somewhere.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.402
- Possible civilians inside?
- Highly doubtful.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.403
This racetrack's been shut down
for months.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.086
Move out!

21:28.160 --> 21:30.686
Skye, run a back end
from the tactical van.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.684
You, I want you 6 feet
from Skye at all times, weapons hot.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.366
- Ward, it's okay. I'm ready.
- Ward's right.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.604
I feel bad enough you're already back
in the field.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.887
We're not taking any chances
with your safety.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.128
This isn't a surprise party, people.
So you can toss stealth out the window.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.891
Our target's wearing body armor
and has enhanced cybernetics.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.482
Make your shots count. Let's move.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.089
Ringing the bell or knocking?

21:54.160 --> 21:55.650
Knocking, of course.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.247
Clear.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.044
Fitz, you're up.

22:10.400 --> 22:14.325
It's time to hunt, boys.
Let's find us a Deathlok.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.085
Impressive toy.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.728
I prefer the term high-tech hardware.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.526
Skye, you online?

22:32.920 --> 22:34.126
Hang on.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.328
Northwest corridor is getting something.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.209
I'm pulling up a live feed.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.885
I can't confirm it's him.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.327
Initiating multi-spectrum overlay.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.924
What the hell did they do to him?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.047
What are you seeing?

22:51.120 --> 22:53.487
It's not just his leg or his eye.
They did stuff to him.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.250
It's all under his skin.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.609
Uh, signal's dead. Retriever's down.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.809
- He knows we're here.
-Fitz, get back to the van. Now!

23:22.080 --> 23:23.764
Contact! Incoming!

23:35.080 --> 23:36.206
Ward, are you okay?

23:37.600 --> 23:38.886
Uh, I got two men down!

23:38.960 --> 23:41.088
- We need a med team!
- Requesting one now.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.286
May, he's coming your way.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.931
GOT him!

24:00.600 --> 24:02.409
He just ducked into
the southwest stairwell.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.481
In pursuit.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.400
All teams, he's headed
into the sub-basement.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.448
I do not have a visual.

24:10.520 --> 24:13.444
Fitz, you have a Retriever down here?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.010
On their way.

24:34.320 --> 24:35.321
Easy.

24:36.280 --> 24:37.805
I come in peace.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.564
How about a signal next time?

24:51.480 --> 24:52.891
Fitz, you getting this?

24:52.960 --> 24:55.804
Uh, barely, sir.
It leads down into the sewer system.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.089
That's under
at least 40 feet of concrete.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.446
We'll be blind down there.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.485
Where's that little guy going?

25:06.600 --> 25:08.284
Sir, there's someone else down there.

25:09.560 --> 25:10.800
Copy that.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.690
What the hell?

25:32.800 --> 25:35.963
Agent Coulson. Agent Garrett.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.921
I surrender.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.690
Forgive me if we don't shake hands.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.647
I don't like to be touched.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.683
Sir, we've got
a lot of wires back here.

26:00.640 --> 26:01.846
Don't touch anything.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.684
We need this room swept
for explosives.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.162
There are no traps here,
Agent Coulson.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.762
You're here because
we are destined to meet.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.049
You're The Clairvoyant?

26:13.120 --> 26:15.202
I'm Thomas Nash.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.011
Mr. Po gave me that other name.

26:18.080 --> 26:21.323
A bit dramatic for my taste.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.890
Eyes open, everybody.
We don't know where Deathlok is,

26:24.960 --> 26:26.086
or who else is down here.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.522
Mr. Peterson is gone.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.803
I cut his feed so you won't find him.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.611
But you had him lead us here. Why?

26:35.360 --> 26:39.922
So I could see you
with my own eyes instead of his.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.847
Now I understand why I couldn't
see you after you died.

26:44.920 --> 26:49.050
Because you yourself could not see.

26:49.760 --> 26:53.526
You were simply a broken man,

26:53.600 --> 26:56.843
who did not know he was broken.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.606
You're one to talk.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.690
Let's pack this freak off to
the Fridge where he belongs.

27:03.760 --> 27:06.366
Agent Garrett. Look at me.

27:06.560 --> 27:11.088
Do you believe you can confine
me any more than this chair?

27:11.160 --> 27:14.448
Can somebody please tell me
how we turn that stupid voice thing off?

27:14.840 --> 27:18.731
I will join Raina in your prison,
Agent Coulson.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.920
But I will see you wherever you go.

27:23.920 --> 27:27.402
Just as I saw you holding

27:27.480 --> 27:29.721
Skye in your arms.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.970
Bleeding.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.971
Dying.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.964
Knowing it was all your fault.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.240
You're going away.

27:48.440 --> 27:52.126
We're gonna stick you in a little box
where no one will ever hear you again.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.481
I see you're angry.

27:54.560 --> 27:57.928
Head clouded with lies.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.048
You've been betrayed.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.203
And now you fear
what's about to happen.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.124
Nothing's about to happen.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.129
Just more empty threats from you.

28:07.280 --> 28:10.921
No. It is the inevitable.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.647
A force beyond your
comprehension is coming for you.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.888
You and Skye.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.685
She has something we want,

28:19.800 --> 28:23.247
and she will die giving it to us.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.245
I have seen it.

28:26.880 --> 28:27.927
Go to hell.

28:28.840 --> 28:33.801
No matter where I go,
or what you do to me,

28:33.880 --> 28:36.645
- I will always...

28:45.600 --> 28:46.601
What did you do?

28:52.640 --> 28:54.449
Wait, what just happened?

28:54.560 --> 28:55.971
Did Ward just...

28:56.040 --> 28:58.884
Oh, my Lord. I can't believe it.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.042
Bet The Clairvoyant
didn't see that coming.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.761
He's dead.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.687
It's over.

29:15.200 --> 29:18.488
He's a specialist.
Cold blood's a basic requirement.

29:18.600 --> 29:19.931
I know.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.561
Still I didn't think Ward
would just do something like that.

29:23.640 --> 29:26.211
The whole reason I sent him to you
was to knock off the rough edges.

29:26.280 --> 29:27.520
Maybe you did your job too well.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.124
He let his emotions get the best of him.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.042
You want me to escort him
to the Hub for debrief?

29:34.120 --> 29:37.488
No. I wanna talk to him before
he goes in front of the review board.

29:38.440 --> 29:40.522
Understood. I got my orders, then.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.443
Gotta stay on the hunt for Deathlok.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.602
Copy that. Keep me in the loop?

29:44.720 --> 29:46.484
Will do. Take care.

29:46.560 --> 29:49.166
And, Phil, go easy on the kid.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.042
Just got a message from H.Q.

29:55.280 --> 29:58.727
Director Fury's back.
He's waiting for you at the Triskelion.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.080
About damn time.

30:00.880 --> 30:03.042
You can talk to him about
what's been bothering you.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.646
A lot's bothering me.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.244
Thought you were Coulson.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.731
Thanks.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.481
Why'd you do it?

30:38.320 --> 30:40.846
I lost it. I got angry.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.849
He pushed all the right buttons.

30:42.920 --> 30:46.322
Coulson said the mission
was to capture, not to kill.

30:47.560 --> 30:51.690
Think about what The Clairvoyant said.
What he's done.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.683
Think about the Centipede program.

30:54.360 --> 30:57.409
How he experimented on innocent
people, like Mike Peterson.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.000
How he kidnapped
and tortured Coulson.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.361
How he ordered Quinn to shoot you.

31:03.360 --> 31:07.649
And he wasn't gonna stop, Skye,
not until you were...

31:12.120 --> 31:13.963
I wasn't gonna let that happen.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.323
So what happens now?

31:17.400 --> 31:19.562
I face a S.H.I.E.L.D. review board.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.644
Whatever the punishment, I'll take it.
I deserve it.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.522
But I don't regret what I've done.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.609
- You don't?
-No.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.449
Not if it means you're safe.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.887
You and the rest of the team.

31:54.800 --> 31:55.926
--Yes!

32:00.360 --> 32:02.442
- Fitz?
- Don't use my name, Jemma!

32:02.520 --> 32:05.364
Why not? I thought you said... Use...
Encrypted line?

32:05.440 --> 32:07.010
You're cutting in and out. Hold on.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.281
What happened... Ward?

32:08.360 --> 32:11.523
Yeah, you said, "Ward."
Took us all by surprise.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.729
Keep talking. Okay?
I'm gonna see if I can clear it up.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.928
No idea...

32:17.000 --> 32:19.401
There's been a great deal of
commotion on this end.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.403
Hang on, now.
I think I found the problem.

32:21.480 --> 32:25.201
Looks like someone else
is tapping the hardline.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.884
Wait, Fitz,
I think something's happening.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.207
There's agents rushing
to the Situation Room.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.691
- What?

32:30.960 --> 32:32.121
Jemma?

32:33.440 --> 32:37.206
Jemma, can you hear me?
Oh, bloody hell.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.804
Mind if I talk some stuff
through with you?

32:48.880 --> 32:49.881
Are you busy?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.650
I'm worried.

32:51.720 --> 32:52.721
About Ward?

32:53.840 --> 32:57.561
I know. I can't believe he'd
just kill someone like that.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.083
I'm worried he killed the wrong man.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.767
How do we know it was him?

33:04.840 --> 33:07.889
He never spoke.
The computer spoke for him.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.803
How do we know
he was the one controlling it?

33:09.880 --> 33:13.123
Are you saying Nash could have been
pretending to be The Clairvoyant?

33:14.120 --> 33:16.566
I'm saying Nash could've been a prop.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.600
And now he's dead.

33:18.680 --> 33:20.409
After the attacks led us right to him.

33:21.040 --> 33:24.283
The investigation all wrapped up
in a neat little bow.

33:24.360 --> 33:26.840
I feel like he could still be
out there, right now,

33:26.920 --> 33:28.365
in our heads.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.246
Or in our files.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.683
When you told me
to check into the psych evals,

33:33.760 --> 33:37.367
you said something, you said,
"Read his mind." And it got me thinking.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.683
And Ward said that The Clairvoyant
knew how to push all the right buttons.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.604
Raina did that to me, too.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.529
Did she mention your father's death?

33:47.600 --> 33:50.922
Your psych evaluation
called it a "defining moment."

33:55.080 --> 33:57.082
These aren't just personality tests.

33:57.160 --> 34:01.051
They're surveillance on every agent.
Pictures. Stats.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.009
Where you've been stationed,
who you visit,

34:03.080 --> 34:04.081
where you'd like to eat.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.365
"Dinners at The Richmond."

34:07.880 --> 34:09.848
He's been monitoring us.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.201
Think about it.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.408
The Clairvoyant only knew
you'd be at Quinn's villa...

34:13.480 --> 34:14.719
After I dropped the tracker.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.404
And the only thing
he's had trouble seeing

34:16.480 --> 34:18.244
is what happened to you after you died.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.322
Because Director Fury
wouldn't release that file to anyone.

34:20.960 --> 34:21.960
No.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.639
The Clairvoyant doesn't have abilities.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.165
He has security clearance.

34:27.760 --> 34:30.001
He's an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.605
- Sir. First off, I wanna say...
-Save it.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.251
I don't want your apologies,
I don't want your excuses.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.129
- I'm not making excuses.
-The only thing I wanna know

34:49.199 --> 34:52.601
is whether you made the call yourself,
or did someone order you to do it?

34:53.600 --> 34:54.681
What?

34:54.760 --> 34:57.366
Don't play dumb, Agent Ward.
Just answer the question.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.363
Did someone order you
to kill The Clairvoyant?

35:02.720 --> 35:04.085
May?

35:29.560 --> 35:31.085
Another encrypted line.

35:33.440 --> 35:35.647
What are you up to, Agent May?

35:41.960 --> 35:43.325
What are you doing here?

35:44.240 --> 35:45.241
Um...

35:45.840 --> 35:49.049
I was just wondering, since we're...

35:49.120 --> 35:51.851
'Cause we're going to the Triskelion,

35:52.040 --> 35:54.281
I thought you would like to...

35:54.760 --> 35:56.842
There's gonna be an aviation team
on the ground.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.922
They could probably recalibrate it.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.685
But I think it should be all right.

36:07.760 --> 36:08.807
- Fitz!
-What?

36:08.880 --> 36:10.882
- I was just looking for you.
-Why? I didn't do anything!

36:10.960 --> 36:11.961
- What?
-What?

36:12.040 --> 36:13.769
I didn't say you did. What did you do?

36:14.600 --> 36:15.601
Well,

36:16.800 --> 36:18.131
I'm not quite sure, actually.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.481
Because,

36:19.800 --> 36:22.963
I was down doing maintenance
in the avionics bay before...

36:24.080 --> 36:25.570
Okay, why would May,

36:26.120 --> 36:29.442
why would May have an unauthorized
encrypted hardline in the cockpit,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.844
complete with a thumb scanner?
That isn't in any of the plane's specs.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.883
- Slow down, an encrypted hardline?
-Yeah.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.690
Dedicated to one receiver.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.441
She's not supposed to have that.
Who is she talking to?

36:41.840 --> 36:43.524
- Cut the line.
-What?

36:43.600 --> 36:45.568
You need to cut the line, right now, Fitz.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.125
Do not let her call out!

37:13.120 --> 37:16.090
Agent Melinda May. Update log 95.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.803
I wasn't put on your plane

37:40.880 --> 37:43.531
so you could make me
a better person, Coulson!

37:43.600 --> 37:45.841
You put me here to make the hard call,
and I made it.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.570
That's not what I asked you,
Agent Ward.

37:47.640 --> 37:51.690
I answered your question.
I wasn't working with anybody.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.762
I take full responsibility
for my own actions.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.410
Then what...

37:55.760 --> 37:58.001
- What?
-We have a problem.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.730
Put it down. Put it down, May!

38:40.240 --> 38:42.641
It's not what you think, Coulson.
It's just an ICER.

38:42.840 --> 38:46.322
This one's not.
It's real, with real bullets.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.767
So you better put yours down
and tell me what the hell's going on.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.251
Right now.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.086
-I...
-Now!

38:53.960 --> 38:55.166
I can't.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.686
You better listen to the man, Agent May.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.842
You have no idea what you're doing.

39:00.960 --> 39:04.521
Maybe not, but I know you're
not fast enough to take us both.

39:11.240 --> 39:12.241
Look,

39:13.400 --> 39:16.210
I can explain everything, but not here.

39:16.280 --> 39:19.204
Why not here?
You have to check with someone first?

39:19.280 --> 39:21.442
Using that encrypted phone
in the cockpit?

39:22.760 --> 39:24.125
Who's on the other end
of that line, May?

39:26.240 --> 39:27.446
I can't say.

39:27.520 --> 39:30.126
That's okay. I think I know.

39:31.080 --> 39:34.050
It makes sense now why Deathlok
put Blake in critical condition,

39:34.120 --> 39:35.485
and left you alive and well.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.244
Why he led us to the track,

39:37.320 --> 39:39.607
only to disappear,
instead of defending his boss.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.205
Why would he do that?

39:41.280 --> 39:44.568
Because that wasn't his boss, was it?
Was it?

39:44.640 --> 39:47.120
- What are you talking about?
-Stop lying to me!

39:47.840 --> 39:50.571
Who do you answer to?
Who's the real Clairvoyant?

40:14.800 --> 40:16.484
What did you do? Where are we going?

40:16.600 --> 40:18.841
I don't know. I didn't do it, Phil!

40:18.920 --> 40:21.207
I don't know what's happening here!
I swear!

40:21.280 --> 40:23.009
If you're not doing this, who is?

40:25.000 --> 40:28.447
When that plane touches down,
take out everyone on board.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.010
Except Agent Coulson.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.443
He's mine.
