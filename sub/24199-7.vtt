WEBVTT

00:00.028 --> 00:02.097
Previously on "The Americans"...

00:02.130 --> 00:03.331
We want you to find out

00:03.365 --> 00:05.433
what your wife is doing
and tell us.

00:05.467 --> 00:07.769
And if you have to...
stop her.

00:07.802 --> 00:09.271
I'm not doing the thing
with Kimmy.

00:09.304 --> 00:11.539
I warned her not to go to
any Communist countries.

00:11.573 --> 00:13.341
It's over.

00:13.375 --> 00:15.844
We have someone in Chicago.
Just sent an emergency signal.

00:15.878 --> 00:18.113
He's been working on whatever
it is you're working on.

00:18.146 --> 00:19.614
It means he can't get arrested.

00:19.647 --> 00:22.017
Codename, Harvest.

00:22.050 --> 00:23.718
Been a gold mine.

00:23.751 --> 00:26.154
We've been getting all sorts
of intel on how he operates.

00:26.188 --> 00:28.023
We're starting to use it
to track down the rest of them.

00:28.056 --> 00:29.524
You should be here.

00:29.557 --> 00:31.393
One of us is in trouble
in Chicago, Philip.

00:31.426 --> 00:32.995
Someone who's doing his job.

00:33.028 --> 00:34.729
I'm going there to help him.

00:34.762 --> 00:38.833
There are people out there
who don't like our way of life.

00:38.867 --> 00:41.003
The only way to get to peace

00:41.036 --> 00:45.573
is to stand firm against those
who wish us harm.

00:45.607 --> 00:48.410
Just between us, what are
the chances we'll pull this off?

00:48.443 --> 00:50.012
Not great.

00:50.045 --> 00:52.414
I'm not sure I can accomplish
what I came here for

00:52.447 --> 00:55.717
without... more help.

00:55.750 --> 00:58.353
Sit tight.
I'm on my way.

01:05.027 --> 01:06.261
Oh.

01:09.697 --> 01:11.333
Hey, come on in.
Hey.

01:11.366 --> 01:13.168
If you move fast, you might
get to the pumpkin pie

01:13.201 --> 01:14.669
before Henry finishes it.

01:14.702 --> 01:16.905
Yeah, I figured he'd be here
with the leftovers.

01:16.939 --> 01:18.573
Hey, listen...

01:18.606 --> 01:23.078
um, I'm actually on my way
to the airport right now.

01:23.111 --> 01:26.414
Elizabeth's having trouble with
that, um, client in Houston.

01:26.448 --> 01:30.452
The guy's a real jerk, so I'm gonna
have to go down and help her out.

01:30.485 --> 01:32.620
Oh.
Yeah, I know.

01:32.654 --> 01:34.756
Poor kid came all this way home
to be with us,

01:34.789 --> 01:37.792
and first his mom leaves,
and now...

01:37.825 --> 01:39.694
Yeah, he'll understand.

01:39.727 --> 01:42.464
I don't know.

01:42.497 --> 01:44.632
Well, we have enough leftovers
for a few days,

01:44.666 --> 01:47.735
so I won't let him starve.

01:47.769 --> 01:49.071
He goes back to school Sunday.

01:49.104 --> 01:51.739
But, um, thanks.

01:51.773 --> 01:53.775
That would be better
than frozen pizzas.

01:53.808 --> 01:55.243
Yeah, no problem.

02:02.517 --> 02:03.918
Hey, Dad.

02:03.952 --> 02:05.087
Hey.

02:09.991 --> 02:14.162
Henry, I'm...
I'm really sorry, but...

02:14.196 --> 02:18.633
You know the work thing
that Mom's dealing with?

02:18.666 --> 02:22.337
It's not going well, so...

02:22.370 --> 02:24.606
I'm gonna have to
fly out there and help.

02:26.374 --> 02:28.143
Oh.

02:28.176 --> 02:29.444
Okay.

02:29.477 --> 02:32.080
When are you gonna come back?

02:32.114 --> 02:34.082
Unfortunately...

02:34.116 --> 02:35.717
after you leave.

02:37.185 --> 02:39.121
All right.
Hey, don't...

02:39.154 --> 02:41.023
don't worry about it.

02:41.056 --> 02:43.958
Just, uh, have a good trip,
and I hope everything works out.

02:45.660 --> 02:48.463
Oh, uh, Stan, uh, hurry up.
It's about to start.

02:48.496 --> 02:49.764
Oh, yeah.
I'll... I'll be right there.

02:49.797 --> 02:50.999
All right.

02:51.033 --> 02:52.534
"Police Academy."

02:54.802 --> 02:56.404
All right.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:12.220 --> 03:13.321
Hey.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.595
Is something going on?

03:22.597 --> 03:24.899
What do you mean?

03:24.932 --> 03:27.735
Look, I can tell
something's wrong.

03:27.769 --> 03:30.805
Okay, I'm good
with these things...

03:30.838 --> 03:32.840
Wh-What things?

03:34.109 --> 03:37.011
Knowing when somebody's
not telling me something.

03:39.947 --> 03:41.149
I'm your friend.

03:41.183 --> 03:45.253
We're like...
best friends, okay?

03:45.287 --> 03:48.556
Something's up with you.

03:52.094 --> 03:54.129
I'm worried
about this work thing.

03:56.464 --> 03:57.699
Okay.

03:59.467 --> 04:00.802
Okay.

04:02.970 --> 04:05.107
But it feels like
more than that.

04:09.377 --> 04:12.380
You know, I used to ask myself,

04:12.414 --> 04:14.549
why is this guy, and his wife,

04:14.582 --> 04:16.584
coming home at three, four
in the morning?

04:16.618 --> 04:18.353
How hard can they possibly work?

04:18.386 --> 04:22.124
What's...
What's driving them?

04:22.157 --> 04:24.126
And even now,
I see you, and I wonder...

04:24.159 --> 04:26.328
what is going on with him?

04:27.795 --> 04:29.964
I see your stress level
and I just...

04:32.900 --> 04:37.539
I say this to you
as a friend, okay?

04:37.572 --> 04:41.509
Are you involved with something?

04:46.148 --> 04:47.415
Stan...

04:47.449 --> 04:49.817
'Cause if something's
going on...

04:49.851 --> 04:51.586
you can trust me.

05:01.263 --> 05:03.298
I've been wanting to tell you.

05:06.801 --> 05:09.937
The business is falling apart.

05:09.971 --> 05:12.440
And I think it might be
going under.

05:18.613 --> 05:19.781
Oh.

05:22.116 --> 05:24.085
Oh.

05:25.853 --> 05:27.322
For how long?

05:27.355 --> 05:29.857
A while.

05:29.891 --> 05:32.594
Oh, man.

05:32.627 --> 05:34.128
I'm so sorry.

05:36.063 --> 05:37.532
I should have told you.

05:37.565 --> 05:40.635
It... It's terrible.

05:42.370 --> 05:43.838
And... I'm... embarrassed...

05:47.309 --> 05:50.278
Is Elizabeth going nuts?

05:50.312 --> 05:53.515
Kind of.
But you know her.

05:53.548 --> 05:55.717
She's keeping it together.

05:57.552 --> 06:00.622
You should have told me.

06:00.655 --> 06:01.956
I'm there for you.

06:03.858 --> 06:05.059
I know.

06:08.430 --> 06:12.234
Thank you for...

06:13.335 --> 06:15.570
For everything.

06:15.603 --> 06:18.240
Oh, of course.

06:18.273 --> 06:22.076
I'm here any time.

06:22.109 --> 06:23.745
All right.

07:18.927 --> 07:20.020

08:08.962 --> 08:10.964
You look surprised.

08:10.998 --> 08:13.801
I wasn't sure you'd really come.

08:28.982 --> 08:31.652
How was your flight?

08:31.685 --> 08:32.986
Fine.

08:34.855 --> 08:36.690
You didn't...
You didn't have to...

08:36.724 --> 08:38.091
It's fine.

08:44.832 --> 08:46.133
Do you want to take a shower

08:46.166 --> 08:47.468
or...

08:47.501 --> 08:49.002
I'm all right.

08:52.773 --> 08:54.342
Are you staying?

09:03.917 --> 09:05.953
Let's get something to eat.

09:28.309 --> 09:30.210
Stan was giving me a hard time.

09:31.545 --> 09:34.047
"Something's wrong. You're not
telling me something."

09:34.081 --> 09:35.683
What'd you tell him?

09:36.917 --> 09:38.752
I was worried
about the business.

09:40.954 --> 09:42.122
That work?

09:42.155 --> 09:44.224
Yeah.

10:05.946 --> 10:09.417
We'll make contact here.
It's fifteen minutes off Cicero.

10:09.450 --> 10:11.051
These streets...

10:11.084 --> 10:12.886
it's tight.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.455
What does this give us?
Thirty seconds?

10:14.488 --> 10:16.957
Give or take.

10:16.990 --> 10:19.993
Hank and Norm will go left,
turn off at Rockwell.

10:20.027 --> 10:24.097
We'll meet up with Marilyn
on Humboldt, near the park.

10:24.131 --> 10:26.800
Not a single handoff point?
You've seen the route.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.437
This is the only street
we can get them in the black.

10:29.470 --> 10:30.571
Whew.

10:30.604 --> 10:32.072
Static posts?

10:32.105 --> 10:34.675
Across from his house.
And at work.

10:34.708 --> 10:37.811
Maybe on his route, too.
I mean, they are all over him.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.715
I've been through this
every way.

10:45.185 --> 10:48.121
I feel a lot better about
our chances with you here.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.595
I wish I could drive you
to school, myself.

10:54.628 --> 10:56.029
Yeah.

10:56.063 --> 10:57.365
Well, maybe next time.

10:57.398 --> 10:58.899
Yeah.

11:03.136 --> 11:05.606
Your friend, w... uh,
what does his dad do?

11:05.639 --> 11:07.341
Mr. Gardner?
Yeah.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.277
Oh, he does, uh, finance,
I think.

11:10.310 --> 11:13.614
I don't know. I just know
they're rolling in dough.

11:13.647 --> 11:15.182
Nice work if you can get it.

11:15.215 --> 11:17.385
Yeah.

11:17.418 --> 11:19.186
Fancy car?
Mercedes.

11:19.219 --> 11:21.855
Oh. But, uh, he's
not driving us.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.056
Mrs. Gardner is.

11:23.090 --> 11:25.493
She has a Cadillac.

11:25.526 --> 11:28.328
Doe Mrs. Gardner work?
Uh...

11:28.362 --> 11:30.698
yeah, she drives Brandon around
whenever he's home,

11:30.731 --> 11:32.733
that's her "occupation."

11:32.766 --> 11:35.703
And what does Mrs. Gardner do
when Brandon's not around?

11:35.736 --> 11:38.739
Shops. And she does
a lot of food combining.

11:38.772 --> 11:40.508
Food combining?

11:40.541 --> 11:42.743
Yeah, basically,
she spends the whole day

11:42.776 --> 11:45.245
figuring out what to eat when.

11:45.278 --> 11:50.350
So, meat. Then fruit.
Then bread. And meat again.

11:50.384 --> 11:54.588
You can't have two things
in the same meal, apparently.

11:54.622 --> 11:56.390
Well, what'll happen if you do?

11:56.424 --> 11:58.258
I don't know.

12:00.193 --> 12:02.095
Must be nice, though.
What's that?

12:02.129 --> 12:04.264
Having your mom
at your beck and call.

12:08.301 --> 12:10.404
Eh, it would probably get old
after a while.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.305
I wouldn't know.

12:16.143 --> 12:20.113
Work has a way
of getting in the way, Henry.

12:20.147 --> 12:22.783
Yeah, but does Renee
ever miss Thanksgiving

12:22.816 --> 12:25.853
because she had to work?

12:25.886 --> 12:27.621
Not likely, I bet.

12:27.655 --> 12:29.790
Well, your dad was there.

12:29.823 --> 12:34.094
Yeah. He makes an effort,
but, I mean, lookit,

12:34.127 --> 12:36.530
he ditches me
in middle of my vacation

12:36.564 --> 12:38.265
and then he leaves you
with the bag.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.970
I don't even know why I bother
coming home for the holidays.

12:45.138 --> 12:46.640
Don't be too hard
on your folks, Henry.

12:46.674 --> 12:49.910
They try, they're not out there
"food combining."

12:51.979 --> 12:55.148
You know, I think he's just
stressed 'cause of work.

12:57.350 --> 13:00.988
How's it going...
the business?

13:01.021 --> 13:04.592
Uh, things are not
going so great right now.

13:06.193 --> 13:07.928
He told you that?

13:07.961 --> 13:09.096
Yeah.

13:10.464 --> 13:13.300
Seems like whatever came up,
must've come up out of the blue.

13:14.868 --> 13:16.436
Must be pretty important.

13:16.470 --> 13:18.271
Always is.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.777
This kind of thing happen a lot?

13:23.811 --> 13:26.313
Look, I mean,
business comes first.

13:26.346 --> 13:28.616
You know, when they get a call
in the middle of the night,

13:28.649 --> 13:30.851
they run off to work.

13:30.884 --> 13:33.821
You'd think
they're brain surgeons.

13:33.854 --> 13:36.657
They ever have you stay
with family when they go away?

13:36.690 --> 13:40.260
I think we're a
little old for baby sitters, Stan.

13:40.293 --> 13:42.596
Yeah, but, you know,
back in the day.

13:42.630 --> 13:44.364
No, not really.

13:44.397 --> 13:46.433
It was usually
just me and Paige.

13:46.466 --> 13:48.268
We didn't have much family.

13:48.301 --> 13:50.370
We just have Uncle Stan.

13:53.907 --> 13:55.709
How about your mom's aunt?

13:55.743 --> 13:58.879
That time she went to take care
of her sick aunt?

13:58.912 --> 14:01.048
Oh, yeah, Aunt Helen.

14:01.081 --> 14:03.383
You remember that?
Yeah.

14:03.416 --> 14:05.719
Yeah, I was on a big case
working these crazy hours,

14:05.753 --> 14:09.056
and when it was finally over,
your mom was gone.

14:09.089 --> 14:10.724
Hmm.

14:10.758 --> 14:12.860
You spend much time
with Aunt Helen?

14:12.893 --> 14:15.295
Oh, no, I never met Aunt Helen.

14:15.328 --> 14:17.364
I think Paige did, though.

14:18.666 --> 14:20.200
I mean, look,
at the end of the day,

14:20.233 --> 14:23.070
it's important
to take care of your family,

14:23.103 --> 14:24.672
when the chips are down.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.208
Can't argue with that.

14:36.950 --> 14:40.554
I don't have
that feeling anymore.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.556
Pulling things off.

14:44.457 --> 14:46.393
Don't be ridiculous.

14:47.695 --> 14:49.362
I'm serious.

15:01.541 --> 15:02.943
Philip.

15:05.412 --> 15:10.618
I was called to Mexico,
beginning of October...

15:10.651 --> 15:14.387
They gave me an assignment...

15:14.421 --> 15:15.656
and this.

15:22.730 --> 15:24.798
I can't be arrested.

15:24.832 --> 15:27.635
What was so important?

15:27.668 --> 15:28.902
They told me not to tell you.

15:28.936 --> 15:32.205
Why?
You quit.

15:32.239 --> 15:33.607
You'd understand if you knew.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.708
Well, then tell me.

15:34.742 --> 15:35.976
I can't.

15:38.445 --> 15:40.881
It's about protecting us.

15:40.914 --> 15:42.415
It's always about protecting us.

15:42.449 --> 15:45.719
No, this is bigger than that.

15:45.753 --> 15:50.390
The guy we're here for,
he's working on it too.

15:50.423 --> 15:52.626
That's why they sent me.

16:09.276 --> 16:11.611
Give it to me.

16:11.645 --> 16:12.980
What would you do with it?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.447
Flush it down the toilet.

16:16.884 --> 16:18.485
No.

16:21.454 --> 16:23.724
Then why did you tell me
you had it?

16:26.126 --> 16:29.830
You're always asking me
to tell you things.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.732
So I told you.

16:54.690 --> 16:56.158
I need five guys.

16:56.191 --> 16:57.292
Right.

16:57.326 --> 16:58.828
Cinco hombres.

16:58.861 --> 17:00.896
- Right here.
- I'm here. Right here, brother.

17:00.930 --> 17:02.031
Right.

17:05.701 --> 17:09.404
- Aqui!
- Oh.

17:09.438 --> 17:11.073
Five guys.

17:47.810 --> 17:51.246
Both sides are
communicating with one another...

18:01.791 --> 18:05.127
Just dropping Harvest
at Fulton and Keating.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.529
You have 'em.

18:07.562 --> 18:09.965
Picking
up Harvest on Fullerton.

18:12.968 --> 18:15.137
The union expressed
that she was pleased with...

19:40.589 --> 19:41.823
Hold up.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.927
Okay, one second.

19:46.595 --> 19:48.230
A lot of greedy people
looking at him...

19:48.263 --> 19:49.865
Got it?

19:51.100 --> 19:53.602
Harvest out of view.

19:56.438 --> 19:57.806
Mother's expecting you.

20:06.916 --> 20:08.717
Go ahead. Go ahead!

20:13.956 --> 20:15.824
It's clearing.
We're moving.

20:15.857 --> 20:17.092
Copy.

20:27.136 --> 20:29.571
Copy that.
Maintaining visual.

20:51.093 --> 20:53.262
Tango,
do you still have Harvest?

20:53.295 --> 20:54.930
I've got a partial view.

20:54.964 --> 20:57.032
Copy that.
Pull past, get a visual.

21:03.572 --> 21:05.140
Shit.

21:05.174 --> 21:08.477
We lost Harvest.
Repeat, we lost Harvest.

21:08.510 --> 21:10.412
FBI!

21:10.445 --> 21:14.416
Baker 4, we're looking for
a green Dodge sedan on Attrill.

21:14.449 --> 21:17.619
A white shuttle bus
turned left on Stave;

21:17.652 --> 21:20.655
A box truck turned right
then left on Francis;

21:20.689 --> 21:23.892
A Jeep Wagoneer, on North Point.

21:48.950 --> 21:51.253
Stop, FBI!

22:00.195 --> 22:02.364
Tango,
do you still have Harvest?

22:02.397 --> 22:03.765
Dan:

22:03.798 --> 22:06.701
Take a left
on Milwaukee Avenue up ahead.

22:24.553 --> 22:27.222
I have a couple of messages.
You have to remember them.

22:30.092 --> 22:32.327
For my mother...

22:55.217 --> 22:56.851
Remember?

22:56.885 --> 22:58.320
I will.

22:58.353 --> 23:02.857
Tell them the sensor schematics
are in France.

23:02.891 --> 23:04.426
Air base in Cazaux.

23:31.052 --> 23:32.954
Where's Milwaukee Avenue?

28:24.914 --> 28:26.648
Potomac Electric's been slow.

28:26.682 --> 28:28.784
We're going to be there
all night pulling records.

28:43.732 --> 28:45.367
What's wrong?

29:01.583 --> 29:03.052
Jesus.

29:03.085 --> 29:04.420
Who are they?

29:04.453 --> 29:06.355
Our guys,

29:06.388 --> 29:08.424
from the team on Harvest.

29:09.758 --> 29:11.760
Harvest, in the van.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.062
And who the hell knows,

29:13.095 --> 29:14.763
without the head and hands.

29:20.302 --> 29:22.738
You were right.
All of it.

29:24.273 --> 29:25.441
Oh, give yourself a break.

29:25.474 --> 29:26.875
I don't need it.

29:26.909 --> 29:29.946
You said everything we do
turns to shit,

29:29.979 --> 29:32.548
and now we've got
two of our guys dead,

29:32.581 --> 29:33.983
and no illegal.

29:36.718 --> 29:38.087
Maybe the leads pan out.

29:41.723 --> 29:43.592
I don't need it, Stan.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.094
Okay.

30:18.127 --> 30:20.396
We're getting a little more
detail from Chicago.

30:20.429 --> 30:22.598
The Mexican guy who was
driving Harvest's car...

30:22.631 --> 30:24.433
he said two guys hired him.

30:24.466 --> 30:27.436
A white guy with a goatee
and a middle-aged black guy.

30:27.469 --> 30:30.872
Then on the bus, it was
the white guy and a white lady.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.576
When are we getting sketches?

30:34.610 --> 30:35.978
They're on the way.

34:30.279 --> 34:31.947
A couple kids...

34:34.416 --> 34:36.051
American dream...

34:37.918 --> 34:40.989
never suspect them...

34:41.022 --> 34:44.560
she's pretty.

34:49.231 --> 34:51.867
He's lucky...

37:04.733 --> 37:07.002
Someone's making me learn.

37:40.682 --> 37:43.685
Hi, is Henry Jennings there,
please? It's his father.

37:43.718 --> 37:44.952
Thanks.

37:47.155 --> 37:49.157
Hi, Henry, we...

37:49.191 --> 37:52.026
Yeah, we're back.

37:52.059 --> 37:53.961
Good, thanks.

37:56.063 --> 37:57.699
Yeah, I'm... I'm...

37:57.732 --> 38:00.168
I'm sorry.
I-I wanted to drive you.

38:01.669 --> 38:04.339
That's funny. Did you tell him
you said that? 'Cause I...

38:06.241 --> 38:07.875
Of course.

38:07.909 --> 38:10.612
Of course.
All right.

38:10.645 --> 38:12.280
Yeah.

38:12.314 --> 38:13.715
Good night.

38:25.493 --> 38:27.262
I've got work.

38:29.431 --> 38:31.799
When will you be back?

38:31.833 --> 38:35.069
Tomorrow night.
If I'm lucky.

38:35.102 --> 38:36.771
Next week's the Summit.

39:25.219 --> 39:27.555
Unh.

39:30.658 --> 39:32.226
That's...

39:32.260 --> 39:34.228
That's so good.

39:34.262 --> 39:36.631
Show me yours.

39:55.583 --> 39:58.119
What am I looking at?

39:58.152 --> 39:59.654
I don't know, I...

39:59.687 --> 40:03.124
It's not a...
It's not a trick question.

40:03.157 --> 40:07.329
J-Just a window
and some clouds.

40:07.362 --> 40:10.798
From... I drew it
from a magazine photo.

40:10.832 --> 40:14.336
Yeah, the proportions are good,
and the shadows are...

40:14.369 --> 40:17.138
But... why...
why did you draw this?

40:20.174 --> 40:23.611
I don't know. It was just
something that I saw.

40:26.147 --> 40:28.450
All right. All right.

40:28.483 --> 40:31.118
All right, you...

40:31.152 --> 40:35.623
you don't know
what you see until...

40:35.657 --> 40:37.792
you need to
bring yourself into it.

40:40.161 --> 40:42.830
If you don't, what is the point?

40:44.699 --> 40:47.168
But if you do...
you do,

40:47.201 --> 40:50.171
there's a moment when...

40:50.204 --> 40:52.340
it's not you seeing it, it's...

40:55.377 --> 40:57.779
I don't know, it's a...

40:57.812 --> 41:00.214
something come...

41:00.247 --> 41:02.283
Something comes through.

41:05.853 --> 41:09.391
You need to
bring all yourself to it.

41:11.559 --> 41:14.496
And then they'll let you...

41:14.529 --> 41:18.466
get out of...
get out of your own way.

41:22.704 --> 41:24.038
Or it doesn't.

41:24.071 --> 41:26.741
You... I know
you have no idea what...

41:26.774 --> 41:29.276
what I'm talking about.

41:37.251 --> 41:39.387
Okay. Let me see.

41:39.421 --> 41:41.423
No!

41:48.129 --> 41:50.432
No. No.

41:50.465 --> 41:51.599
It's been three hours.

41:51.633 --> 41:53.568
I need to focus.
No.

41:53.601 --> 41:54.936
Please, just take it.

41:54.969 --> 41:56.170
Shut up!
I need to work!

42:45.233 --> 42:46.434
You want a coffee?

42:50.538 --> 42:53.307
I gotta start bringing
a change of clothes.

42:53.341 --> 42:55.142
You start leaving the house
with a change of clothes,

42:55.175 --> 42:57.044
Janine's gonna start wondering.

42:58.946 --> 43:00.748
Good point.

43:00.781 --> 43:01.815
What's that?

43:03.351 --> 43:05.886
Six years ago, we had a team
on a woman in Philly...

43:05.919 --> 43:08.155
wife of an illegal
that got killed...

43:08.188 --> 43:10.524
she disappeared
right from under us.

43:11.892 --> 43:14.127
All right. Good.

43:44.091 --> 43:45.559
Thought you were working.

43:47.461 --> 43:49.630
I... I was.

43:49.663 --> 43:50.898
I am.

43:52.833 --> 43:55.703
I-I just...

43:55.736 --> 43:57.170
I wanted to check on you.

44:01.509 --> 44:04.177
In the garage...
your face... I just...

44:15.255 --> 44:17.958
I'm going over to Paige's later.

44:20.661 --> 44:22.530
Was she close with Marilyn?

44:26.500 --> 44:27.701
Still.

44:35.809 --> 44:37.177
Where's Stavos?

44:39.647 --> 44:41.114
I had to let him go.

44:43.351 --> 44:45.218
Lacey and Steve too.

45:04.572 --> 45:07.140
How'd it go in Chicago?
Did you get the guy out?

45:11.078 --> 45:12.846
No.

45:12.880 --> 45:15.015
It didn't go well.

45:15.048 --> 45:16.717
What happened?

45:19.553 --> 45:21.021
He died.

45:22.890 --> 45:24.358
Marilyn, too.

45:30.598 --> 45:31.999
How?

45:34.668 --> 45:36.970
We were in a car,

45:37.004 --> 45:38.706
the FBI...

45:42.109 --> 45:43.677
Marilyn was shot.

45:49.517 --> 45:52.252
Uh, is Dad...?

45:52.285 --> 45:54.321
He's okay.

45:54.354 --> 45:56.790
The whole thing
just went to shit.

45:59.359 --> 46:03.731
I thought you said
this doesn't happen a lot.

46:03.764 --> 46:06.033
It doesn't, but...

46:06.066 --> 46:08.235
it can.

46:08.268 --> 46:10.037
And it does.

46:12.205 --> 46:13.607
Do you understand?

46:13.641 --> 46:14.742
What?

46:17.110 --> 46:19.680
You're going to have to
make a decision, Paige.

46:19.713 --> 46:22.082
To commit to this work,
or to get out.

46:22.115 --> 46:24.518
Because sometimes
this is what we have to do.

46:24.552 --> 46:26.987
And it's not easy,
and it doesn't always end well.

46:29.089 --> 46:31.959
And it's a commitment
you have to make for life.

46:31.992 --> 46:33.260
I understand.

46:33.293 --> 46:34.762
Do you?

46:34.795 --> 46:38.932
I know there's risk,
and what you do is dangerous...

46:38.966 --> 46:42.436
But are you willing to give up
friends, and relationships...

46:42.470 --> 46:46.607
and your life if you have to...

46:46.640 --> 46:48.742
because that's what's
being asked of you.

46:53.781 --> 46:57.585
I don't really have any friends.

47:00.120 --> 47:01.555
I see these kids at school...

47:01.589 --> 47:05.158
they think
they're so political...

47:05.192 --> 47:07.227
but they don't understand
how this whole system

47:07.260 --> 47:09.897
is designed to keep them down.

47:09.930 --> 47:11.665
To keep us
at each other's throats.

47:11.699 --> 47:14.502
It's like
what you and Claudia say...

47:14.535 --> 47:16.837
They're blind to it.

47:16.870 --> 47:21.008
And I'm not afraid to die.

47:21.041 --> 47:22.743
I know that's easy to say,

47:22.776 --> 47:25.813
but that's not
what I'm afraid of.

47:28.115 --> 47:30.250
What are you afraid of?

47:30.283 --> 47:31.552
Being alone.

47:33.787 --> 47:37.024
But I tell myself
someday, I'll meet someone,

47:37.057 --> 47:40.093
like you and Dad.

47:40.127 --> 47:41.795
Well, I hope that you will.

47:44.064 --> 47:45.733
But, you know, your father...

47:47.400 --> 47:50.538
he made a mistake
when he committed to this life.

47:53.306 --> 47:57.044
He was young, younger than you.

47:59.713 --> 48:03.483
If you do this,
it has to be forever.

48:03.517 --> 48:05.586
That's the kind of work it is.

48:10.524 --> 48:11.825
Paige.

48:13.160 --> 48:16.664
It's okay
if this isn't what you want.

48:18.398 --> 48:21.635
This is what I want, Mom,
what I've always wanted.

48:21.669 --> 48:23.336
To make a difference.

48:28.508 --> 48:29.843
Then it's time for you to apply

48:29.877 --> 48:32.546
for an internship
at the State Department.
