NOVV, VVHAT'S THE
STORY ON THIS PLACE?

17:06.858 --> 17:09.601
MY DOG DIDN'T DISAPPEAR
CHASING A CAT,

AND MY CAR DIDN'T
CRASH INTO ANY ROCK.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.940
NOW, WHAT
DID HAPPEN?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.116

17:35.888 --> 17:39.927
YOU THINK IT'S VVISE
LETTING HIM GO LIKE THAT?

17:40.017 --> 17:43.976
HE'LL BE WATCHED.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.804
[thumps hands on table]

17:45.898 --> 17:48.811
WELL, GENTLEMEN...

17:48.901 --> 17:50.812
IT'S HAPPENED.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.235
IT HAD
TO, EVENTUALLY.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.405
NO! IT DIDN'T
HAVE TO.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.904
AND IT WOULDN'T HA\/E IF VVE
KEPT OUR VVITS ABOUT US,

17:58.953 --> 18:00.443
BUT WE DIDN'T.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.404
WE WERE SO COMPLACENT,

18:02.498 --> 18:05.081
SO INFERNALLY SURE OF
OURSELVES AND COMPLACENT.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.420

18:07.503 --> 18:09.164
MR. EVANS,

THE POINT OF KEEPING</i>

18:11.382 --> 18:13.749

I DON'T THINK--

18:15.344 --> 18:16.755
<i>DOESN'T IT SEEM
MORE LIKELY</i>

18:16.846 --> 18:18.257
THAT THERE WOULD
BE MORE INQUIRIES

18:18.347 --> 18:20.008
FOR FOOD
THAN FOR ROOMS?

18:20.099 --> 18:23.262
THERE HASN'T BEEN EITHER
IN OVER 16 YEARS.

18:23.311 --> 18:27.771
YOU SEE?
COMPLACENCY.

18:27.857 --> 18:31.191
AND I'M AS MUCH TO
BLAME AS ANYONE.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.360
IF ONLY THE LITTLE JOHNSON
GIRL HADN'T BEEN SO CARELESS.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.859
IF ONLY FREDERICKS HADN'T
ACTED SUSPICIOUSLY

18:36.949 --> 18:38.656

GASOLINE STATION.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.950

18:42.455 --> 18:44.037
THERE WASN'T ANY
CHOICE BY THEN.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.457
SO NOW...

AN INNOCENT YOUNG MAN VVHO
HASN'T DONE ANYONE ANY HARM

18:51.881 --> 18:54.839

OUR MISTAKES.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.303

23:55.809 --> 23:58.267
PERHAPS, BUT...

23:58.354 --> 23:59.890
IT SAVES A
LOT OF TIME

23:59.980 --> 24:01.766
WHEN YOU WANT TO
MOVE FURNITURE AROUND.

24:01.857 --> 24:02.938
DORN.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.562
YES, MR. EVANS.

24:05.653 --> 24:09.146
LET'S GET
THIS OVER WITH.

24:09.239 --> 24:13.449
I'M SORRY.

24:13.535 --> 24:17.244
YOU SENSED A STORY IN THIS TOVVN, MR.
REDFIELD,

24:17.331 --> 24:19.288
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.833
YOU TURNED OFF ONTO THE
ROAD TO PEACEFUL VALLEY.

24:21.919 --> 24:24.206
YOU SAW CERTAIN THINGS
THAT DEFIED LOGIC.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.798
PEOPLE BEGAN
TO BEHAVE ODDLY,

24:25.881 --> 24:28.293
<i>AND YOU BECAME
CURIOUS, SO...</i>

24:28.384 --> 24:30.466
SO WE HAD
TO STOP YOU.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.340
AND NOW WE MUST
DO EVEN WORSE,

24:33.430 --> 24:35.341
BECAUSE, MR. REDFIELD,

24:35.432 --> 24:39.721
YOU STUMBLED UPON THE BEST-KEPT
SECRET IN THE VVORLD.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.428
WHAT SECRET?

24:41.522 --> 24:44.640
OUR GIFT,
MR. REDFIELD,

24:44.733 --> 24:49.193
BESTOVVED UPON THE PEOPLE OF
THIS VILLAGE 104 YEARS AGO.

24:49.279 --> 24:52.863
A MAN CAME TO PEACEFUL
VALLEY, FROM VVHAT LAND

24:52.950 --> 24:55.817
WHAT PLANET,
NOBODY KNOWS.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.198
HE WAS A
BRILLIANT SCIENTIST

24:58.288 --> 25:01.326
MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS
BEFORE HIS TIME, BUT...

25:01.417 --> 25:06.332
HE WAS ALSO WISE,
AS YOU SHALL SEE.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.333
FROM HIS BRAIN
CAME EQUATIONS

25:08.424 --> 25:12.167
THE LIKES OF VVHIOH NO ONE HAD
EVER SEEN OR DREAMT OF...

25:12.261 --> 25:14.502
NOT ON THIS PLANET,
AT ANY RATE.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.839
<i>OF COURSE, I CANNOT
TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE.</i>

25:17.933 --> 25:22.723
MR. REDFIELD, YOU ARE AVVARE,
I TRUST, THAT THE BASIS

25:22.813 --> 25:26.898
OF THIS COMPLICATED THING
VVE CALL LIFE IS ENERGY.

25:26.984 --> 25:30.318
<i>IT'S A FRIGHTENING
AND MYSTERIOUS FORCE.</i>

25:30.404 --> 25:34.193
THE SCIENTIST'S EQUATIONS
UNLOCKED THIS FORCE,

25:34.283 --> 25:38.868
AND FROM IT CAME THE GREATEST
POVVER FOR GOOD... OR E\/lL

25:38.954 --> 25:41.366
<i>THE UNIVERSE
HAS EVER KNOWN.</i>

25:41.457 --> 25:44.950
HE DECIDED TO ENTRUST
HIS SECRETS--

25:45.044 --> 25:48.332
HIS EQUATIONS AND THE
MACHINES THAT HE HAD BUILT-

25:48.422 --> 25:50.379
TO THREE MEN
HE HAD SELECTED,

25:50.466 --> 25:53.879
AND HE INSTRUCTED THEM TO Gl\/E
THE BENEFIT OF THIS POVVER

25:53.927 --> 25:57.386
TO THE PEOPLE OF PEACEFUL
VALLEY FOR THEIR COMFORT.

25:57.473 --> 26:01.216
BUT UNDER NC CIRCUMSTANCES VVERE
THEY TC RELEASE THE SECRET

26:01.310 --> 26:02.800
TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.262
IT WAS TO REMAIN
IN PEACEFUL VALLEY...

26:05.355 --> 26:13.355
UNTIL HUMANITY LEARNED
THE WAYS OF PEACE.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.940
THAT IS YOUR STORY,
MR. REDFIELD.

26:17.034 --> 26:20.152
<i>YOU SEE WHY WE CANNOT
ALLOW YOU TO LEAVE US.</i>

26:20.245 --> 26:25.240
NO, I CAN'T
SAY THAT I DO.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.450
PERHAPS IF
WE SHOWED YOU.

26:59.618 --> 27:04.658
MR. REDFIELD.

27:04.748 --> 27:08.958
THIS IS THE
ORIGINAL DESIMULATOR,

27:09.044 --> 27:10.455
SOMEWHAT LARGER
THAN THE ONE

27:10.546 --> 27:15.791
WE MOVED YOU
AROUND WITH UPSTAIRS.

27:15.884 --> 27:20.048
MORE OR LESS
THE SAME PRINCIPLE HERE,

27:20.139 --> 27:21.925
BUT WITH A BIG DIFFERENCE.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.177
<i>IT WORKS IN WHAT WE CALL
THE TIME DIMENSION.</i>

27:24.268 --> 27:26.509
IT HAS MANY, MANY USES.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.514
FOR EXAMPLE...

27:28.605 --> 27:35.068
MR. EVANS.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.644
MR. CONNELLY,

27:36.697 --> 27:42.739
WOULD YOU HAND ME
THE LETTER OPENER?

27:42.828 --> 27:50.828
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED,
MR. REDFIELD.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.085

28:12.691 --> 28:14.352

MR. REDFIELD.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.951
ON THIS CONSOLE,
AMONG OTHER THINGS,

28:26.038 --> 28:28.826
VVE HA\/E A DUPLICATING
MACHINE, BUT NOT LIKE OTHERS.

28:32.961 --> 28:37.296
AH. HERE'S SOMETHING.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.248
ON THIS CARD,

28:39.343 --> 28:40.629
WE HAVE A STATEMENT

28:40.719 --> 28:42.084
GIVING THE
ATOMIC STRUCTURE

28:42.179 --> 28:44.295
OF A HAM SANDWICH
ON WHITE BREAD

28:44.389 --> 28:46.426
<i>WITH MUSTARD.</i>

28:46.516 --> 28:48.473
OF COURSE, WE HAVE
LARGER MACHINES

28:48.560 --> 28:49.891
FOR THE BULKIER ITEMS,

28:49.978 --> 28:52.640
BUT THIS WILL
GIVE YOU AN IDEA.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.564
[machine humming]

28:55.609 --> 28:58.567
[humming intensifies]

28:58.654 --> 29:01.316
[humming reaches

29:13.168 --> 29:16.502
I BELIEVE YOU SAID YOU VVERE HUNGRY, MR.
REDFIELD.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.580
WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.337
LOOK, VVHAT VVAS THAT THING
I RAN INTO OUT THERE?

29:22.427 --> 29:24.213
OH, YOU MEAN
IN THE CAR.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.420
I'M, UH, SORRY ABOUT THAT,
BUT VVE HAD TO STOP YOU.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.134
IT WAS AN ENERGY FIELD:

29:28.225 --> 29:30.466
<i>A WALL OF LOOSELY-PACKED
ATOMS, SO TO SPEAK.</i>

29:30.560 --> 29:32.722
PURELY AN
EMERGENCY DEVICE.

29:32.813 --> 29:39.355
THIS LEVER
OPERATES IT.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.821
COME WITH ME,
MR. REDFIELD.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.621
AND THESE ARE THE
SACRED PAPERS,

29:52.708 --> 29:54.619
AS WE CALL THEM...

29:54.710 --> 30:02.458
THE EQUATIONS FROM VVHICH
EVERYTHING YOU SEE CAME ABOUT.

30:02.551 --> 30:03.962
[sighs]

30:04.052 --> 30:05.884
WELL, I THINK
I COULD USE A DRINK.

30:13.729 --> 30:16.938
DO YOU HA\/E ANY IDEA VVHAT
YOU HA\/E DOVVN THERE?

30:17.024 --> 30:18.355
OF COURSE.

30:18.442 --> 30:19.978
AND YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T INTEND

30:20.068 --> 30:21.900
TO SHARE IT VVITH THE
REST OF THE VVORLD?

30:21.987 --> 30:23.443
OH, GOOD
HEAVENS, NO.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.692
WHY?

30:25.782 --> 30:28.035
VVELL, I'\/E ALREADY EXPLAINED, MR.
REDFIELD.

30:28.118 --> 30:29.574
THE WORLD ISN'T READY.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.823
BUT PEACEFUL
VALLEY IS?

30:31.913 --> 30:33.779
WELL, OBVIOUSLY.

30:33.874 --> 30:38.619
VVE HA\/E NO VVAR HERE, NO
CRIME, NO VIOLENCE, NO GREED.

30:38.712 --> 30:41.454
<i>UNLIKE YOUR WORLD,
WE LIVE IN PEACE.</i>

30:41.548 --> 30:44.666
VVE USE THE POVVER FOR
GOOD, NOT FOR E\/IL.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.172
<i>WELL, HOW CAN YOU BE SURE
THE REST OF US WOULDN'T'?</i>

30:47.220 --> 30:49.052
COME, NOW, MR. REDFIELD,

30:49.139 --> 30:53.007
THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION
HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN BLOOD.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.676
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
PEOPLE WANTED THINGS!

30:54.728 --> 30:55.718
WITH THAT POWER--

30:55.812 --> 30:57.189
WITH THIS POWER,

30:57.272 --> 30:59.104
THEY WOULD DESTROY
THE UNIVERSE.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.352
THEY'RE CHILDREN.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.024
BUT THIS
ONE MACHINE--

31:02.069 --> 31:04.356
IT COULD STOP SICKNESS
AND SUFFERINGS.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.028
IT COULD
CURE DISEASE.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.856
WELL, COULDN'T IT?

31:08.950 --> 31:10.691
YES.

31:10.744 --> 31:13.611
AND YOU JUST
LET PEOPLE--

31:13.705 --> 31:17.039
VVELL, DON'T YOU HA\/E
ANY CONSCIENCE ABOUT IT?

31:17.125 --> 31:20.743
YES.

31:20.837 --> 31:24.171
THAT'S VVHY VVE VVILL
NOT RELEASE THE SECRET.

31:24.257 --> 31:28.467
THE SAME POVVER THAT COULD
BE USED TO HEAL SICKNESS

31:28.553 --> 31:30.715
CAN ALSO BE USED TO
DESTROY THE INNOCENT.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.046
YOU SEE, ONE
SECRET WOULD LEAD

31:32.140 --> 31:34.177
TO UNDERSTANDING
THE REST,

31:34.267 --> 31:37.305
AND THAT COULD BE THE
END OF THE VVORLD.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.512
I DON'T
BELIEVE THAT.

31:39.606 --> 31:42.064
THINK, MR. REDFIELD!

31:42.150 --> 31:44.687
THINK!

31:44.778 --> 31:48.396
VVHAT DID YOU DO VVITH PROFESSOR
EINSTEIN'S PRIMITIVE EQUATION,

31:48.490 --> 31:51.778
E = M C SQUARED?

31:51.868 --> 31:54.701
IT COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO
BRING WATERS TO THE DESERTS,

31:54.788 --> 31:57.576
TO FEED STARVING MILLIONS.

31:57.624 --> 32:03.210
WAS IT?

32:03.296 --> 32:08.416
IT VVAS USED TO DESTROY OOUNTLESS
THOUSANDS OF HUMAN BEINGS.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.256
SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO
SIT ON YOUR SECRETS,

32:11.346 --> 32:14.008
USE THEM TO MAKE HAM
SANDVVICHES AND ROADBLOCKS?

32:14.099 --> 32:15.931
HAM SANDWICHES
AND ROADBLOCKS

32:16.017 --> 32:18.475
ARE A BIT BETTER
THAN TOTAL DESTRUCTION,

32:18.562 --> 32:20.178
WOULDN'T YOU SAY,
MR. REDFIELD?

32:20.272 --> 32:21.728
LET'S GET ON
WITH THIS.

32:21.815 --> 32:24.227
YOU'RE A BUNCH
OF HYPOCRITES!

32:24.317 --> 32:26.103
YOU TALK ABOUT US,
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO

32:26.194 --> 32:27.855
<i>WHEN YOU WANT SOMEONE
OUT OF THE WAY'?</i>

32:27.946 --> 32:28.981
WHAT DO YOU DO?!

32:29.072 --> 32:30.403
THE SAME AS WE DO!

32:30.490 --> 32:31.696
YOU ELIMINATE HIM!

32:31.783 --> 32:33.365
BE QUIET!

32:33.452 --> 32:35.614
NO.

32:35.704 --> 32:38.366
HE HAS A POINT,
MR. EVANS.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.949
IT'S JUST WHAT
I'VE BEEN PONDERING.

32:41.001 --> 32:44.790
IF WE KILL
THIS MAN...

32:44.838 --> 32:47.045
IN WHAT WAY DO WE DIFFER
FROM THE OUTSIDERS?

32:47.132 --> 32:48.622
BUT WE DO IT OUT
OF NECESSITY,

32:48.717 --> 32:51.584
NOT OUT OF CHOICE!

32:51.678 --> 32:54.887
THANK YOU
ADOLF HITLER.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.806
IT IS FOR THE GOOD
OF THE WORLD.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.055
WE HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST YOU.

33:00.145 --> 33:04.309
IT'S THE LAVV. VVE CANNOT
GO AGAINST THE LAVV!

33:04.399 --> 33:09.985
AND LET HIM WHO DISCOVERS
THE SECRET BE ELIMINATED.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.818
YOU CAN BE ELIMINATED
IN ONE OF TWO WAYS:

33:12.866 --> 33:16.450
THROUGH DEATH
OR THROUGH ASSIMILATION.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.618
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

33:18.705 --> 33:23.415
WILL YOU DIE,
OR WILL YOU JOIN US?

33:23.502 --> 33:26.620
YOU MEAN LIVE HERE
THE REST OF MY LIFE?

33:26.713 --> 33:27.999
EXACTLY.

33:28.048 --> 33:30.289
BECOME ONE OF US.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.999
IT REALLY
WON'T BE SO BAD.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.768
SUBSTANTIALLY, YES.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.816

33:58.328 --> 34:01.696

YOUR STUDY.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.872
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE TYPEWRITER,

ASKED ME TO.

34:24.020 --> 34:27.012

I WANTED TO.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.518
YEAH, BUT WHY?

34:34.322 --> 34:37.735
I'M NOT.

34:42.330 --> 34:46.915
DO YOU PLAY CHESS?

34:47.002 --> 34:48.242

34:48.295 --> 34:49.659
NO, NO.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.607
BECAUSE I'M NOT
STAYING HERE.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.936
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

35:15.989 --> 35:17.070
YOU'LL HAVE NO CHOICE.

GIVE THEM ANY MILK!
