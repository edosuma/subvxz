WEBVTT

00:02.260 --> 00:04.350
[balloon inflating]

00:08.220 --> 00:09.610
Hey, Mom.

00:09.660 --> 00:11.880
Oh, honey, thanks for
picking up the rest

00:11.920 --> 00:14.230
-of the wedding party things.
-You're welcome.

00:14.270 --> 00:16.490
Did they give you any hassle
about the coupons?

00:16.530 --> 00:18.970
I didn't use them.
It was too embarrassing.

00:19.010 --> 00:20.750
Honey-- Honey...

00:20.800 --> 00:24.110
I spent all day
cutting those out.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.850
Oh, God, look at the time.

00:25.890 --> 00:28.240
I gotta get ready.
I look like a nut!

00:28.280 --> 00:30.940
Ken's gonna be here,
and I look crazy.

00:30.980 --> 00:32.640
Honey, what do you think?

00:32.680 --> 00:36.340
Put one of these
on the piano?

00:36.380 --> 00:37.550
Oh, you got a piano.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.470
-Yes.
-That's fun.

00:39.510 --> 00:42.860
-Came with the, uh, jazz trio.
-[chuckles]

00:42.910 --> 00:45.130
You know, I'm going to walk
down the aisle to Coltrane.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.220
Oh, that's nice.

00:46.260 --> 00:47.480
-Yeah, Ken picked it out.
-[playing piano]

00:47.520 --> 00:49.090
-[ringtone playing]
-It seems right,

00:49.130 --> 00:50.350
-you know?
-Mm-hmm.

00:50.390 --> 00:52.570
Ah, speak of the devil.

00:52.610 --> 00:54.960
Ken?

00:55.010 --> 00:56.270
Are you on the plane, honey?

00:56.310 --> 01:00.320
Well, about that, Christine,
um, I missed my flight.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.800
This carpet recall thing
is taking

01:01.840 --> 01:03.150
a lot longer than I thought.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.930
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

01:04.970 --> 01:07.710
Bottom line is
I'm on the last flight,

01:07.760 --> 01:10.330
and I don't know if it'll
even get me there on time.

01:10.370 --> 01:11.590
I'm thinking maybe once
I'm on the flight,

01:11.630 --> 01:15.720
I could buy Internet, and we
could Skype to each other and,

01:15.770 --> 01:18.510
I don't know,
maybe we can, uh,

01:18.550 --> 01:21.510
exchange vows over Skype.

01:21.550 --> 01:23.340
-I-I don't know.
-Oh, honey,

01:23.380 --> 01:25.380
that never works on a plane.
You know?

01:25.430 --> 01:28.260
That's not gonna work out
at all.

01:28.300 --> 01:31.170
Well...

01:31.220 --> 01:34.050
Uh...

01:34.090 --> 01:36.480
You know what, honey?

01:36.530 --> 01:38.830
We can get married anytime.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.840
-It sounds like you're
really needed there.
-[stops playing]

01:41.880 --> 01:43.190
I want you to stay there.

01:43.230 --> 01:44.320
I mean, are you sure?

01:44.360 --> 01:46.190
I mean, really,
are you okay with that?

01:46.230 --> 01:47.280
You know what?

01:47.320 --> 01:50.060
I'll change this into
a housewarming party, honey.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.630
-Oh, Christine.
-You know,
what's the difference?

01:52.670 --> 01:54.850
Honey, I wanted you to have
your special wedding,

01:54.890 --> 01:56.200
like we planned.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.940
Oh, honey, I have you,

01:57.980 --> 02:00.070
-and that's all I want.
-[playing piano]

02:00.120 --> 02:03.860
You take care of that,
and it'll all work out.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.990
Christine,
you are amazing, baby.

02:06.030 --> 02:08.210
-Have a good housewarming.
-Take care.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.600
Good luck with the recall,
honey.

02:09.650 --> 02:13.170
-Love you, my bride.
-Love you.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.390
I'm sorry, Mom.

02:15.430 --> 02:19.050
Oh. Things happen,
honey, in life.

02:19.090 --> 02:20.270
You okay?

02:21.440 --> 02:22.350
Yeah.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.100
Okay, good.

02:24.140 --> 02:25.840
Well, since there's
no wedding, I guess I'll get

02:25.880 --> 02:27.530
an early start on my gig
at the hospital,

02:27.580 --> 02:29.540
-if that's okay.
-Yeah.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.450
Hey, honey, I'm really glad
you're doing that.

02:31.490 --> 02:33.320
You really cheer those kids up.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.320
They really need something
like that right now.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.370
And you're good at it,
and you're an artist, honey.

02:37.410 --> 02:39.850
Thanks, Mom.
Thank you.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.330
[sighs]

02:44.380 --> 02:47.210
CHIP:
Hi.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.420
Hey, Doctor.

02:48.470 --> 02:49.900
Hey, patient.

02:49.950 --> 02:52.340
Hello, Nurse.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.730
Afternoon to you--
[exhales, gasps]

03:02.350 --> 03:03.480
Hello, Tyler!

03:03.530 --> 03:05.880
How are you?

03:05.920 --> 03:08.790
Well, I'm in the hospital, so...

03:08.840 --> 03:11.360
[imitating phone ringing]

03:13.670 --> 03:15.100
Hello?

03:15.150 --> 03:17.450
Yeah, she's here.
I'll let you talk to her.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.800
Banana phone.
[chuckles]

03:19.850 --> 03:21.410
Well, I have an actual phone.

03:21.460 --> 03:22.850
Okay.

03:22.890 --> 03:24.240
All right.

03:24.290 --> 03:26.240
Uh, I left something
down in the basement.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.420
I'm gonna go get it.
I'll be right back. [chuckles]

03:28.460 --> 03:30.250
[humming]
Something in the basement.

03:30.290 --> 03:32.160
Oh, I found it.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.380
I know it's not actual water,

03:35.430 --> 03:37.080
I've seen
the Harlem Globetrotters.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.300
-[sighs]
-You can go now.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.480
Your smart-ass attitude
is not going to get you

03:42.520 --> 03:44.390
-into a good college.
-[ringtone playing]

03:44.440 --> 03:45.480
-Yeah, hello?
-KEN: Hey, Chip.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.830
What's that?

03:47.870 --> 03:49.310
Yeah.

03:49.350 --> 03:50.530
Hey, Chip. How you doing?

03:50.570 --> 03:52.400
[sighs] Actually,
I'm having a tricky time

03:52.440 --> 03:54.490
with my grief clowning.

03:54.530 --> 03:57.100
-Oh, this kid is tricky.
-Listen, Chip,

03:57.140 --> 03:58.930
I just wanted to check in
to make sure

03:58.970 --> 04:00.500
that your mom isn't still upset

04:00.540 --> 04:02.500
about me not being there
for the wedding.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.980
-Well, she-she seems fine.
-Really?

04:05.020 --> 04:06.890
Now, you would tell me,
Chip, if she wasn't?

04:06.940 --> 04:09.420
I mean, she's not just
putting on a brave face?

04:09.460 --> 04:11.290
Yeah, I'd tell you.
I'm not a good liar.

04:11.330 --> 04:13.470
-Actually, that's a lie.
-Well, you know

04:13.510 --> 04:15.510
-I would be there if I could.
-Yeah, I know that.

04:15.550 --> 04:17.300
Amanda!
Why are you still here?

04:17.339 --> 04:20.990
You should be on your way
to Boulder!

04:21.040 --> 04:22.430
Chip, I gotta go.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.480
Yeah, I gotta go, too.
I gotta get back

04:23.520 --> 04:25.300
-to my clowning emergency.
-Yeah, well,

04:25.350 --> 04:27.740
good luck with your
clowning emergency.

04:27.780 --> 04:29.390
Okay, bye.

04:31.610 --> 04:33.400
[whispering]:
Thank you.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.360
Oh, God.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.530
Well, it's really
the same thing.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.450
It's just gonna be
a housewarming now.

04:40.490 --> 04:43.320
Yeah, o-okay, no problem.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.020
D-Do you need to talk
about this?

04:45.060 --> 04:47.460
-It-it-it seems like a lot.
-No.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.150
But please come to the
housewarming and have some

04:50.200 --> 04:52.330
delicious housewarming cake.

04:52.370 --> 04:55.460
Oh, Christine,
you must be crushed.

04:55.510 --> 04:58.160
For what? Ken just had
a carpet emergency.

04:58.210 --> 05:01.470
Well, my ex-husband had
a carpet emergency, too.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.600
She was 26 years old.

05:03.650 --> 05:05.600
No, Carol. What-what I don't
think you understand is,

05:05.650 --> 05:08.040
I don't need the jazz trio.

05:08.090 --> 05:11.000
And it's gonna be $67.50
for the cramp medicine,

05:11.040 --> 05:13.700
cigarettes, adult diapers,
nicotine gum, please.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.610
You still smoking and chewing
the nicotine gum

05:15.660 --> 05:16.790
at the same time, Fred?

05:16.830 --> 05:18.440
What's going on with you?
Thanks so much.

05:18.490 --> 05:19.360
Have a good one, buddy.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.450
["Star-Spangled Banner"
ringtone playing]

05:21.490 --> 05:24.580
Not during business hours, Mama.Stanley.

05:24.620 --> 05:27.450
I've been giving you free
Internet for-for way too long.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.930
I'd say to the tune
of about 500 smackeroos. Okay?

05:29.980 --> 05:31.460
I need to get a wedding gift
for my mom.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.720
What do you got for me?

05:32.760 --> 05:36.200
Well, I got a golf cart that
used to belong to Gary Busey.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.240
I got it at auction.

05:37.290 --> 05:40.160
Gary Busey? Hmm.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.640
My mom did love that Buddy Hollymovie he was in.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.030
She loves golf carts.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.640
It's a very practical gift.

05:45.690 --> 05:47.390
I'll throw in a fox-fur
lap blanket.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.730
Done deal, I'll take 'em both.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.520
Wonderful, thanks so much. Next!

05:51.560 --> 05:53.000
How you doing, Cotton?

05:53.040 --> 05:56.050
Okay, where were we?
Oh, yeah, I remember.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.530
[Chip laughing]

05:57.570 --> 05:59.530
-Hey!-Oh, let me get that off of you.

05:59.570 --> 06:01.620
-[groans] What's your problem?-Let me help you get that off...

06:01.660 --> 06:03.530
Hey, stop!

06:03.580 --> 06:05.490
-Isn't this funny?
-You're not funny!

06:05.530 --> 06:07.750
-Well, I just-- it's just...
-I'm gonna call the nurse.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.800
Why? Don't call--
please don't call the nurse.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.540
-Nurse, please come in.
-[stammers] Nur-- okay,

06:10.580 --> 06:11.890
-don't call the... no nurses.
-NURSE: Nurses' station.

06:11.930 --> 06:13.190
-What do you need?
-There's a scary hobo

06:13.240 --> 06:14.190
in my room.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.330
I'm not a ho-- I'm a clown.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.460
I-I'm a clown.
This is a costume.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.460
-Okay...
-Forget it.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.200
[laughs] Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

06:24.250 --> 06:26.340
[exhales sharply]

06:29.730 --> 06:31.780
Yeah, I'll let you talk to her.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.650
Ew!

06:46.710 --> 06:48.620
How'd it go in the kids ward?

06:50.540 --> 06:52.840
I've had better shows.

06:52.890 --> 06:55.710
Yeah, it's tricky now, right?

06:55.760 --> 06:57.500
Uh, what do you mean?

06:57.540 --> 06:59.020
The kids these days.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.680
All they've seen in,
like, movies,

07:00.720 --> 07:04.290
video games is all scary clowns,killer clowns. You know?

07:04.330 --> 07:07.470
Like the Joker
and the, like, It.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.690
I mean, even in real life,
like the... what's his name,

07:10.730 --> 07:13.520
John Wayne.
Um, the murderer.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.650
-He's a murderer,
and he wore clown makeup.
-What?

07:15.690 --> 07:19.040
-John Wayne was a clown?
-John Wayne Gacy.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.740
John Wayne Gacy.
I think that's the airport.

07:21.780 --> 07:23.530
Is it? Doesn't matter.

07:23.570 --> 07:25.530
The fact is, you're in a world
where no child

07:25.570 --> 07:30.840
has seen Bozo, and every child
has seen murdering clowns.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.060
But I--
I'm an old-fashioned clown.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.410
-I'm a traditionalist.
-Yeah, you are.

07:36.450 --> 07:40.320
And that's why, like,I wear this for the other wards.

07:40.370 --> 07:43.370
Like, the old people
who are, frankly, dying.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.590
But I got a new look
for the kiddos.

07:45.630 --> 07:46.980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

07:47.030 --> 07:48.940
-Boom.
-Oh, dear.

07:52.730 --> 07:54.560
-What are you, Pantyhose Man?
-No.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.690
Turtleneck Man?

07:55.730 --> 07:57.080
I call it Spiderweb Man.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.210
-Spiderweb Man?
-It's a superhero.

07:59.260 --> 08:01.740
[chuckles]They're based on the best of us.

08:01.780 --> 08:05.090
Right? Clowns are based
on a homeless person.

08:05.130 --> 08:06.740
What are you talking about?

08:06.790 --> 08:08.790
Oh. I made this.

08:11.050 --> 08:12.440
Look.

08:12.490 --> 08:14.450
You can... you can borrow that.

08:14.490 --> 08:17.100
-Who is that, Mitt Romney?
-No, it's Superhero Man.

08:17.140 --> 08:20.150
You put that on,
kids are gonna go crazy.

08:20.190 --> 08:22.150
[singsongy]:
You'll get laughs.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.500
Remember those?

08:31.640 --> 08:33.030
Martha, thanks for
coming in early to help.

08:33.070 --> 08:34.770
Really appreciate it.

08:34.809 --> 08:36.900
Sure, Mrs. Baskets.
I want to be here for you

08:36.950 --> 08:38.559
in your time of need.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.039
-Is Chip coming?
-Oh, I'm sure he is.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.430
But, you know,he is clowning at the hospital.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.700
Oh, I didn't realize
he was clowning again.

08:47.740 --> 08:48.910
That's great.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.660
Oh, he didn't tell you?
That surprises me.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.180
Well, he is so busy,
it really doesn't surpri...

08:54.220 --> 08:55.700
Oh, God, this won't work.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.400
Martha, will you go get
the Monopoly game

08:58.450 --> 09:00.400
in the game room?

09:00.450 --> 09:02.230
Sure. You have a game room?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.840
I do. It's right next
to the gift-wrapping room.

09:04.890 --> 09:06.580
-Okay.
-JIM [chuckles]: Christine!

I said that Ken had

17:40.010 --> 17:43.230
a carpet emergencyand that we changed the wedding

17:43.270 --> 17:46.190
into a housewarming party.

17:46.230 --> 17:49.370
You turned it
into a housewarming... party?

17:49.410 --> 17:51.200
Is this a prank, Mom?

17:51.240 --> 17:52.540
-No.
-What is this?

17:52.590 --> 17:56.510
Nobody turns a weddinginto a housewarming party, Mom.

17:56.550 --> 17:58.330
That's evil.

17:58.380 --> 18:01.340
-Hey, easy there, pal.-"Easy, pal" to you, Uncle Jim.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.690
[scoffs] What kind of man
cancels his wedding

18:02.730 --> 18:05.210
on the day of the wedding?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.560
Huh? Who is this Ken guy?

18:06.600 --> 18:08.560
He sounds like a shyster.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.520
He sounds like a scoundrel.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.390
And just because I'm
a gentleman, I'm not gonna say

18:12.430 --> 18:14.960
I told you so, but...

18:15.000 --> 18:16.310
Well, you just did tell me so.

18:16.350 --> 18:19.400
I told you so with my face,
but not verbally, okay?

18:19.440 --> 18:21.360
-No, I heard it verbally, honey.-Well, if there's no wedding,

18:21.400 --> 18:23.140
there's no wedding gift.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.800
I guess I'll have to get this
golf cart back to Gary Busey.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.320
Yes. The Gary Busey.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.320
This was his.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.320
[sighs]

18:32.850 --> 18:35.370
[all screaming]

18:35.410 --> 18:37.370
MRS. BASKETS:
Dale, are you okay?

18:37.420 --> 18:39.770
-Was that really Gary Busey's?
-Mother!

18:44.470 --> 18:45.860
[tires screeching]

18:45.900 --> 18:46.950
MRS. BASKETS:
It's still light out.

18:46.990 --> 18:48.990
You really have to go?

18:49.040 --> 18:51.210
-Oh, honey, thanks.
-Are you gonna be okay?

18:51.260 --> 18:53.390
-I hope so. [chuckles]
-Oh.

18:53.430 --> 18:54.780
-Oh, thanks.
-I love you, sweetie.

18:54.820 --> 18:56.170
-Ah...
-Oh, thank...

18:56.220 --> 18:58.090
Oh, thank you
for the beautiful music.

18:58.130 --> 18:59.390
-No-no problem.
-It was so good.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.960
I'd pay good money
to see that show in Vegas.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.750
-Golf cart in a pool?
-[laughs] Oh...

19:02.790 --> 19:04.400
-Get some rest!
-We got to go, Mom.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.880
-Aw, you're leaving?
-Congrats on the house.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.180
-Yeah, we love you, Mom.
-Oh...

19:07.230 --> 19:08.450
Mmm.

19:08.490 --> 19:10.320
Yeah, you didn't have
any of the, uh...

19:10.360 --> 19:12.280
-the cake.
-Nah.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.240
-There's a lot
of housewarming cake.
-Hey, Mom.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.410
-Nah, we good, Mom.
-Mom?
-What?

19:16.450 --> 19:20.330
Is it okay if I put plastic
plates in the dishwasher?

19:20.370 --> 19:22.420
[sighs]:
Oh.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.250
Put everything in there.

19:30.380 --> 19:32.250
[exhales]

19:35.130 --> 19:36.910
[exhales sharply]

19:36.950 --> 19:39.430
-[door opens]
-KEN: Hello?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.090
Anybody home?

19:41.130 --> 19:44.480
Ken? What are you doing here?

19:44.530 --> 19:48.920
Well, I thought about it, and Ijust couldn't miss our big day.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.450
I got to fly
right back out tomorrow,

19:50.490 --> 19:52.400
but I wanted to be here tonight.

19:52.450 --> 19:55.450
-Well, honey, it's over.
-Christine.

19:55.490 --> 19:58.840
I told you I could fly back,
but you said no.

19:58.890 --> 20:00.890
You said it was no big deal.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.590
Well, it wasn't a big deal,
and then people started

20:02.630 --> 20:04.370
coming up to me and saying,

20:04.420 --> 20:07.160
"Are you okay, Christine?
Why isn't Ken here?

20:07.200 --> 20:10.380
Where's Ken? I thought Ken
was gonna be here,"

20:10.420 --> 20:13.380
so I felt so alone.

20:13.420 --> 20:17.470
Well, they were probably just
being concerned about you.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.080
And I realize now
that I should have been, too.

20:20.130 --> 20:23.480
[sighs]:
Oh, God.

20:23.520 --> 20:28.530
My first marriage was a mess,
and now

20:28.570 --> 20:33.100
my second marriage,I'm not even to the "I do's..."

20:33.140 --> 20:35.100
[exhales]
and it's a mess.

20:38.970 --> 20:40.890
Christine, I'm sorry.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.720
I'm sorry I missed today.

20:44.760 --> 20:50.420
[sighs] I made a big mistake
that I wish I hadn't made.

20:50.460 --> 20:54.990
I guess I'm just not good at
juggling my business in Denver

20:55.030 --> 20:58.380
and having my new life here.

20:59.820 --> 21:03.950
Well... you missed quite a show.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.520
Dale drove a golf cart
straight into the pool.

21:08.570 --> 21:12.180
[chuckles]: My brother
said he was gonna beat you up,

21:12.220 --> 21:14.360
and he was crazy.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.750
And all my friends, I found outthey can't carry a tune.

21:17.790 --> 21:19.320
[chuckles]

21:19.360 --> 21:22.580
Why doesn't any of that
surprise me?

21:22.620 --> 21:27.320
So, I guess if that's all okay,I guess I could forgive you.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.500
[sighs]

21:29.850 --> 21:32.330
Christine,
let's get married tonight.

21:32.370 --> 21:34.460
Tonight? Nobody's here.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.990
Eh. Who cares?

21:37.030 --> 21:38.990
Let's do it.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.510
Just the two of us.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.780
