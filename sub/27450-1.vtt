07:01.033 --> 07:03.767
<i>of war with the golden pole,</i>

07:03.867 --> 07:07.367
<i>and you can't use</i>

07:03.867 --> 07:07.367
<i>the ground for help.</i>

07:07.467 --> 07:10.266
[Liam]<i> Whoever can hang on</i>

07:07.467 --> 07:10.266
<i>and generate the most force</i>

07:10.367 --> 07:12.900
<i>will hit the target</i>

07:10.367 --> 07:12.900
<i>and punch their ticket</i>

07:13.000 --> 07:14.734
<i>to Mount Olympus.</i>

07:21.400 --> 07:23.900
<i>So it's Dr. Proctor</i>

07:21.400 --> 07:23.900
<i>versus the Pit Bull.</i>

07:24.000 --> 07:25.433
<i>You heard Dwayne</i>

07:24.000 --> 07:25.433
<i>say it earlier.</i>

07:25.533 --> 07:27.300
<i>He's waited years</i>

07:25.533 --> 07:27.300
<i>for this moment.</i>

07:27.400 --> 07:29.000
[Alex]<i> And now</i>

07:27.400 --> 07:29.000
<i>it's finally here,</i>

07:29.100 --> 07:31.133
<i>so take it away, DJ.</i>

07:31.233 --> 07:34.200
Ayonna and Emily,

07:34.300 --> 07:36.400
no one controls

07:34.300 --> 07:36.400
your fate, but you.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.467
Clear your mind,

07:36.500 --> 07:38.467
take a deep breath,

07:38.567 --> 07:40.767
and show the world

07:38.567 --> 07:40.767
what you're capable of.

07:40.867 --> 07:43.100
This is Herculean Pull.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.600
[crowd cheering]

07:48.400 --> 07:50.266
[Liam]<i> And the race is on.</i>

07:50.367 --> 07:52.500
[Alex]<i> Both competitors</i>

07:50.367 --> 07:52.500
<i>have gone to the opposite sides</i>

07:52.600 --> 07:54.066
<i>of the pyramid,</i>

07:52.600 --> 07:54.066
<i>so now it's a battle</i>

07:54.166 --> 07:57.367
<i>to pull out</i>

07:54.166 --> 07:57.367
<i>that 100-pound pole.</i>

07:57.467 --> 07:59.333
[Liam]<i> They're using</i>

07:57.467 --> 07:59.333
<i>their arms to pull</i>

07:59.433 --> 08:01.967
<i>and their legs</i>

07:59.433 --> 08:01.967
<i>to push off the pyramid.</i>

08:02.066 --> 08:04.734
[Alex]<i> And look at that.</i>

08:02.066 --> 08:04.734
<i>Ayonna actually falls down</i>

08:04.834 --> 08:06.767
<i>at the sheer weight</i>

08:04.834 --> 08:06.767
<i>of the pole</i>

08:06.867 --> 08:08.867
<i>and the force</i>

08:06.867 --> 08:08.867
<i>that she's exerting.</i>

08:08.967 --> 08:10.533
[Liam]<i> Both athletes</i>

08:08.967 --> 08:10.533
<i>have one pole out,</i>

08:10.633 --> 08:12.367
<i>working on the second pole</i>

08:10.633 --> 08:12.367
<i>before they move on</i>

08:12.467 --> 08:14.967
<i>-to that golden pole.</i>

08:12.467 --> 08:14.967
-[Alex]<i> Uh-oh, wait a minute,</i>

08:15.066 --> 08:16.533
<i>Emily managed</i>

08:15.066 --> 08:16.533
<i>to get the pole out first.</i>

08:16.633 --> 08:19.333
<i>Now she's gonna climb up</i>

08:16.633 --> 08:19.333
<i>to the top of the golden pole.</i>

08:19.433 --> 08:20.934
<i>Emily falls right off,</i>

08:21.033 --> 08:23.767
<i>giving Ayonna the chance</i>

08:21.033 --> 08:23.767
<i>to climb up to the golden pole.</i>

08:23.867 --> 08:26.000
<i>Ayonna, now, is gonna</i>

08:23.867 --> 08:26.000
<i>be on the attack here.</i>

08:29.834 --> 08:31.734
[Liam]<i> Look at</i>

08:29.834 --> 08:31.734
<i>the leg strength.</i>

08:35.000 --> 08:36.567
<i>Ayonna Proctor right there,</i>

08:36.667 --> 08:39.767
<i>getting herself</i>

08:36.667 --> 08:39.767
<i>right back in this.</i>

08:39.867 --> 08:41.934
They are digging deep.

08:43.467 --> 08:46.934
[Alex]<i> Both women fighting</i>

08:43.467 --> 08:46.934
<i>with everything they've got,</i>

08:47.033 --> 08:49.633
<i>desperate to move on</i>

08:47.033 --> 08:49.633
<i>to Mount Olympus.</i>

08:52.600 --> 08:54.533
<i>Ayonna has managed</i>

08:52.600 --> 08:54.533
<i>to make this one</i>

08:54.633 --> 08:58.066
<i>into a neck-and-neck battle,</i>

08:54.633 --> 08:58.066
<i>and she's taken the lead.</i>

08:59.367 --> 09:02.200
<i>And for Emily, she's got the</i>

08:59.367 --> 09:02.200
<i>powerful hands of a masseuse.</i>

09:02.300 --> 09:04.867
<i>She's got to use that grip</i>

09:02.300 --> 09:04.867
<i>to even things up here.</i>

09:10.700 --> 09:13.233
<i>Go! Go! All you got!</i>

09:19.033 --> 09:21.767
This comes down

09:19.033 --> 09:21.767
to who wants it more.

09:21.867 --> 09:24.100
[Liam]<i> And for Ayonna,</i>

09:21.867 --> 09:24.100
<i>you're trying to hang on</i>

09:24.200 --> 09:25.333
<i>to pull the pole back</i>

09:25.433 --> 09:27.266
<i>without losing your balance</i>

09:25.433 --> 09:27.266
<i>or your grip.</i>

09:27.367 --> 09:29.533
<i>Pull it back! Pull it back!</i>

09:31.000 --> 09:32.734
-[Alex]<i> Oh!</i>

09:31.000 --> 09:32.734
-[Liam]<i> But she falls down!</i>

09:32.834 --> 09:36.066
[Alex]<i> But Emily has no idea,</i>

09:32.834 --> 09:36.066
<i>and the golden pole</i>

09:36.166 --> 09:37.633
<i>is headed</i>

09:36.166 --> 09:37.633
<i>in the other direction.</i>

09:37.734 --> 09:41.166
<i>The Pit Bull</i>

09:37.734 --> 09:41.166
<i>pulling with all her might.</i>

09:41.266 --> 09:44.166
<i>Emily's on her tiptoes,</i>

09:41.266 --> 09:44.166
<i>and she's getting leverage</i>

09:44.266 --> 09:48.066
<i>from her knees.</i>

09:44.266 --> 09:48.066
<i>She's just inches away,</i>

09:48.166 --> 09:51.567
<i>and Ayonna</i>

09:48.166 --> 09:51.567
<i>holding on for dear life.</i>

09:51.667 --> 09:54.600
<i>And, oh, she's right there.</i>

09:51.667 --> 09:54.600
<i>Just--</i> Oh!

09:54.700 --> 09:56.567
-[Liam]<i> And there it is.</i>

09:54.700 --> 09:56.567
-[Alex]<i> That's it,</i>

09:56.667 --> 10:00.533
<i>and she's moving on</i>

09:56.667 --> 10:00.533
<i>to Mount Olympus.</i>

10:00.633 --> 10:03.200
[Liam]<i> The massage therapist,</i>

10:00.633 --> 10:03.200
<i>the mixed martial artist,</i>

10:03.300 --> 10:07.700
<i>and now one step closer</i>

10:03.300 --> 10:07.700
<i>to being a Titan.</i>

10:07.800 --> 10:11.033
-Ayonna, yo, good job.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.033
-Thank you.

10:11.133 --> 10:12.133
-Great job.

10:11.133 --> 10:12.133
-Okay.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.033
[Liam]<i> And pure elation</i>

10:13.400 --> 10:16.033
<i>for Emily.</i>

10:17.200 --> 10:19.200
<i>Ayonna got off</i>

10:17.200 --> 10:19.200
<i>to a rough start</i>

10:19.300 --> 10:20.533
<i>and hit the ground hard.</i>

10:20.633 --> 10:23.300
<i>Emily got to</i>

10:20.633 --> 10:23.300
<i>the golden pole first.</i>

10:23.400 --> 10:26.800
<i>Dr. Proctor fought valiantly,</i>

10:23.400 --> 10:26.800
<i>and it looked like she had it,</i>

10:26.900 --> 10:29.734
<i>but when she fell,</i>

10:26.900 --> 10:29.734
<i>Emily, the Pit Bull,</i>

10:29.834 --> 10:32.000
<i>grabbed hold</i>

10:29.834 --> 10:32.000
<i>and didn't let go,</i>

10:32.100 --> 10:34.166
<i>securing the victory.</i>

10:36.333 --> 10:38.333
-[cheers and applause]

10:36.333 --> 10:38.333
-Good job. Good job.

10:38.433 --> 10:40.700
[Liam]<i> Now Emily is headed</i>

10:38.433 --> 10:40.700
<i>to Mount Olympus</i>

10:40.800 --> 10:43.100
<i>with the chance</i>

10:40.800 --> 10:43.100
<i>to become a Titan.</i>

10:44.834 --> 10:46.867
[dramatic music]

10:55.834 --> 10:57.066
Hey, guys.

10:57.166 --> 11:00.600
[all screaming]

11:00.700 --> 11:01.767
Thank you so much.

11:01.867 --> 11:04.367
-Pleasure. Nice to meet you.

11:01.867 --> 11:04.367
-Welcome. Welcome.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.800
-How you guys doing?

11:05.100 --> 11:06.800
-Great.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.000
Look, when you guys

11:06.900 --> 11:09.000
go out there,

11:09.100 --> 11:10.767
you--you know,

11:09.100 --> 11:10.767
the nerves are gonna be there.

11:10.867 --> 11:13.700
That's normal, right,

11:10.867 --> 11:13.700
but it's what we live for,

11:13.800 --> 11:15.033
moments like this.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.000
And also remember, like,

11:17.100 --> 11:18.700
you guys have earned

11:17.100 --> 11:18.700
the right to be here,

11:18.800 --> 11:20.633
so everybody out there

11:18.800 --> 11:20.633
cheering you on,

11:20.734 --> 11:23.033
I mean, they're here

11:20.734 --> 11:23.033
to see you, all right.

11:23.133 --> 11:24.734
I mean, they're here to see me

11:23.133 --> 11:24.734
a little bit, but--

11:24.834 --> 11:26.300
[laughter]

11:26.400 --> 11:27.734
So go out and have fun

11:27.834 --> 11:29.934
and, um, yeah, and go kick ass.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.734
[Alex]<i> Hey, nothing like</i>

11:33.600 --> 11:35.734
<i>a pep talk from The Rock</i>

11:35.834 --> 11:37.133
<i>to get you fired up.</i>

11:37.233 --> 11:39.734
[Liam] Now, let's get back

11:37.233 --> 11:39.734
to the action. DJ?

11:39.834 --> 11:42.433
I've always lived my life

11:39.834 --> 11:42.433
by the creed,

11:42.533 --> 11:44.500
blood, sweat, respect.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.166
The first two you give.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.166
The last one you earn.

11:47.266 --> 11:49.166
I've always lived my life

11:47.266 --> 11:49.166
by another creed.

11:49.266 --> 11:52.367
A nice romantic dinner,

11:49.266 --> 11:52.367
a bottle of very fine tequila

11:52.467 --> 11:55.233
will lead

11:52.467 --> 11:55.233
to one sexy date night.

11:55.333 --> 11:59.367
Yes. That's why I keep having

11:55.333 --> 11:59.367
Rock babies.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.400
Too much information.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.533
Time for our next battle.

12:03.633 --> 12:06.467
This is a matchup

12:03.633 --> 12:06.467
of two hard-working guys,

12:06.567 --> 12:08.667
I don't know if they like

12:06.567 --> 12:08.667
tequila or not. We'll find out,

12:08.767 --> 12:11.500
But one's a truck driver

12:08.767 --> 12:11.500
who works long days,

12:11.600 --> 12:13.800
but still finds time

12:11.600 --> 12:13.800
to chase his Titan dream.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.900
The other's

12:13.900 --> 12:15.900
a construction worker

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
who had a tough road

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
to get here.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.367
<i>People might look at me</i>

12:21.033 --> 12:22.367
<i>and think</i>

12:22.467 --> 12:24.200
<i>I'm just</i>

12:22.467 --> 12:24.200
<i>a regular, normal guy.</i>

12:24.800 --> 12:26.100
<i>But I guarantee you</i>

12:26.200 --> 12:28.166
<i>that any competitor out there</i>

12:26.200 --> 12:28.166
<i>that would go against me</i>

12:28.266 --> 12:30.233
<i>has not put in the work</i>

12:28.266 --> 12:30.233
<i>that I've put in.</i>

12:31.667 --> 12:32.967
<i>Here you go, Mike.</i>

12:33.066 --> 12:34.233
[Cari]<i> Surprisingly, Mike Evans</i>

12:34.333 --> 12:35.800
<i>wasn't an athlete</i>

12:34.333 --> 12:35.800
<i>in high school.</i>

12:35.900 --> 12:37.300
<i>His journey</i>

12:35.900 --> 12:37.300
<i>to The Titan Games</i>

12:37.400 --> 12:39.266
<i>began seven years ago</i>

12:39.367 --> 12:42.166
<i>when he started working</i>

12:39.367 --> 12:42.166
<i>construction with his Dad.</i>

12:42.266 --> 12:43.800
I thought you'd be

12:42.266 --> 12:43.800
carrying three.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.000
You're only carrying two.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.266
It's father and son,

12:45.100 --> 12:47.266
but it's also like--

12:47.367 --> 12:48.700
like I'm his brother almost.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.033
I'm very proud of you,

12:50.133 --> 12:51.533
and I know your Mom would be

12:50.133 --> 12:51.533
really proud of you, too.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.867
<i>My childhood</i>

12:52.333 --> 12:53.867
<i>was very difficult.</i>

12:53.967 --> 12:55.834
<i>My Mom was sick.</i>

12:55.934 --> 12:57.633
<i>She actually had</i>

12:55.934 --> 12:57.633
<i>Parkinson's disease,</i>

12:57.734 --> 13:00.367
<i>and she struggled</i>

12:57.734 --> 13:00.367
<i>with drug addiction.</i>

13:02.166 --> 13:04.633
I was 13 years old

13:02.166 --> 13:04.633
when my Mom passed away.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.734
<i>I remember being</i>

13:05.900 --> 13:07.734
<i>afraid of the dark,</i>

13:07.834 --> 13:09.166
<i>not wanting to eat,</i>

13:09.266 --> 13:11.133
<i>not wanting to talk to anybody,</i>

13:11.233 --> 13:13.734
<i>but I never gave up,</i>

13:11.233 --> 13:13.734
<i>I always stayed positive,</i>

13:13.834 --> 13:17.066
<i>and I found something</i>

13:13.834 --> 13:17.066
<i>that I love.</i>

13:17.166 --> 13:20.367
<i>I go to the gym two hours</i>

13:17.166 --> 13:20.367
<i>a night, six days a week.</i>

13:20.467 --> 13:23.400
<i>After the gym, I always visit</i>

13:20.467 --> 13:23.400
<i>my Mom at the cemetery.</i>

13:23.500 --> 13:25.667
<i>I want</i>

13:23.500 --> 13:25.667
<i>to keep her memory alive.</i>

13:26.633 --> 13:28.600
<i>I'm absolutely</i>

13:26.633 --> 13:28.600
<i>competing for my Mom.</i>

13:28.700 --> 13:30.900
<i>I've trained harder</i>

13:28.700 --> 13:30.900
<i>than I've ever trained.</i>

13:31.000 --> 13:33.734
<i>Nothing will stop me</i>

13:31.000 --> 13:33.734
<i>from becoming a Titan.</i>

13:36.967 --> 13:38.734
[cheers and applause]

13:38.834 --> 13:40.734
[Liam]<i> Mike Evans</i>

13:38.834 --> 13:40.734
<i>is formidable,</i>

13:40.834 --> 13:42.100
<i>but his opponent,</i>

13:42.200 --> 13:44.900
<i>who calls himself</i>

13:42.200 --> 13:44.900
<i>the Haitian Sensation,</i>

13:51.200 --> 13:53.967
[Cari]<i> Dwayne Johnson designed</i>

13:51.200 --> 13:53.967
<i>this competition for people</i>

13:54.066 --> 13:55.834
<i>like James Jean-Louis,</i>

13:55.934 --> 14:00.000
<i>who hits the gym every day,</i>

13:55.934 --> 14:00.000
<i>even after a 12-hour shift</i>

14:00.100 --> 14:03.200
<i>carrying Budweiser kegs</i>

14:00.100 --> 14:03.200
<i>around Miami.</i>

14:03.300 --> 14:06.800
<i>Over a day, I deliver</i>

14:03.300 --> 14:06.800
<i>500 cases of beer.</i>

14:06.900 --> 14:08.967
<i>I need to work hard,</i>

14:06.900 --> 14:08.967
<i>because where I'm from,</i>

14:09.066 --> 14:11.233
second chances

14:09.066 --> 14:11.233
don't come like this often,

14:11.333 --> 14:14.133
and this is a major

14:11.333 --> 14:14.133
second chance for me.

14:14.233 --> 14:17.133
<i>When I was 23 years old,</i>

14:14.233 --> 14:17.133
<i>I got arrested.</i>

14:17.233 --> 14:18.934
<i>It scared me a lot.</i>

14:19.033 --> 14:21.266
<i>I didn't think</i>

14:19.033 --> 14:21.266
<i>that I was gonna be there</i>

14:21.367 --> 14:22.767
<i>to raise my son,</i>

14:22.867 --> 14:24.100
<i>and that was my wake-up call.</i>

14:24.200 --> 14:25.800
<i>That's when I realized</i>

14:24.200 --> 14:25.800
<i>it's time for me</i>

14:25.900 --> 14:27.567
<i>to step up to the plate</i>

14:25.900 --> 14:27.567
<i>and become a father.</i>

14:27.667 --> 14:30.233
Above all else, you know,

14:27.667 --> 14:30.233
you come first.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.900
[laughs]

14:32.000 --> 14:33.133
<i>How's it going?</i>

14:33.233 --> 14:35.467
[Cari]<i> Every day,</i>

14:33.233 --> 14:35.467
<i>James wakes at 4:00 a.m...</i>

14:35.567 --> 14:36.800
You save this for later.

14:36.900 --> 14:39.200
[Cari]<i> makes breakfast</i>

14:36.900 --> 14:39.200
<i>for nine-year-old Semaj</i>

14:39.300 --> 14:41.433
<i>and gets him off to school.</i>

14:41.533 --> 14:45.066
<i>Then it's sunup to sundown</i>

14:41.533 --> 14:45.066
<i>delivering beer...</i>

14:46.266 --> 14:47.967
<i>some heavy lifting in the gym,</i>

14:48.066 --> 14:50.633
<i>pick up Semaj,</i>

14:48.066 --> 14:50.633
<i>and make them dinner.</i>

14:50.734 --> 14:53.400
<i>And then he gets up early</i>

14:50.734 --> 14:53.400
<i>and does it all again.</i>

14:53.500 --> 14:54.667
Let me get my pushups, man.

14:54.767 --> 14:56.867
<i>It's a grind,</i>

14:54.767 --> 14:56.867
<i>but he's setting an example</i>

14:56.967 --> 14:59.600
<i>for the most important person</i>

14:56.967 --> 14:59.600
<i>in his life.</i>

14:59.700 --> 15:02.333
I want my son to actually

14:59.700 --> 15:02.333
look at me as his hero,

15:02.433 --> 15:03.734
and so I can't fail.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.667
<i>A Titan is a person</i>

15:03.834 --> 15:05.667
<i>who went through hardships</i>

15:05.767 --> 15:06.867
<i>but overcame them.</i>

15:06.967 --> 15:08.333
I will be a Titan.

15:16.600 --> 15:20.066
[Liam]<i> And there's Semaj along</i>

15:16.600 --> 15:20.066
<i>with James' Dad and his sister.</i>

15:20.166 --> 15:23.533
[Alex]<i> Three generations</i>

15:20.166 --> 15:23.533
<i>of Jean-Louis men in the house.</i>

15:23.633 --> 15:25.000
<i>And look at that physique.</i>

15:25.100 --> 15:27.967
<i>He gives new meaning</i>

15:25.100 --> 15:27.967
<i>to the term six-pack abs, Liam.</i>

15:28.066 --> 15:29.500
Here's the thing.

15:28.066 --> 15:29.500
James and Mike

15:29.600 --> 15:32.433
about to get medieval

15:29.600 --> 15:32.433
on this challenge.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.900
It was inspired

15:32.533 --> 15:34.900
by the way ancient armies

15:35.000 --> 15:37.066
would lay siege to a castle.

15:37.166 --> 15:40.200
Behold, the mighty

15:37.166 --> 15:40.200
Hammering Ram.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.734
<i>This brutal test</i>

15:42.100 --> 15:43.734
<i>will challenge</i>

15:43.834 --> 15:47.300
<i>all eight muscle groups</i>

15:43.834 --> 15:47.300
<i>in your upper body.</i>

15:47.400 --> 15:49.533
[Liam]<i> You start by swinging</i>

15:47.400 --> 15:49.533
<i>the ten-pound hammer</i>

15:49.633 --> 15:51.734
<i>against a metal plate,</i>

15:49.633 --> 15:51.734
<i>generating upwards</i>

15:51.834 --> 15:55.066
<i>of half a ton of force</i>

15:51.834 --> 15:55.066
<i>with every swing</i>

15:55.166 --> 15:59.800
<i>until it triggers the release</i>

15:55.166 --> 15:59.800
<i>of the 350-pound ram.</i>

15:59.900 --> 16:02.266
[Alex]<i> From there,</i>

15:59.900 --> 16:02.266
<i>it's a test of brute force</i>

16:02.367 --> 16:04.000
<i>to see who can break through</i>

16:04.100 --> 16:06.200
<i>the massive wooden doors first,</i>

16:06.300 --> 16:07.533
<i>pull the victory chain,</i>

16:07.633 --> 16:10.700
<i>and claim your spot</i>

16:07.633 --> 16:10.700
<i>on Mount Olympus.</i>

16:14.867 --> 16:16.667
This is exactly

16:14.867 --> 16:16.667
what I envisioned

16:16.767 --> 16:18.333
when I conceived these games,

16:18.433 --> 16:22.133
everyday people who are also

16:18.433 --> 16:22.133
ridiculously talented athletes

16:22.233 --> 16:23.266
going head-to-head.

16:23.367 --> 16:25.133
They've always deserved

16:23.367 --> 16:25.133
a platform

16:25.233 --> 16:26.800
to show the world

16:25.233 --> 16:26.800
what they've got,

16:26.900 --> 16:28.934
and now they finally have one.

16:29.033 --> 16:32.300
James and Mike,

16:32.400 --> 16:34.066
this is your opportunity.

16:34.166 --> 16:37.800
This is your moment.

16:34.166 --> 16:37.800
This is Hammering Ram.

16:39.033 --> 16:41.166
[dramatic music]

16:43.667 --> 16:46.300
[Liam]<i> It's time to throw down.</i>

16:43.667 --> 16:46.300
<i>Step one,</i>

16:46.400 --> 16:49.533
<i>smashing that steel plate</i>

16:46.400 --> 16:49.533
<i>with your ten-pound hammer.</i>

16:49.633 --> 16:52.533
[Alex]<i> Both guys putting</i>

16:49.633 --> 16:52.533
<i>those massive muscles to work,</i>

16:52.633 --> 16:55.066
<i>one righty and one lefty.</i>

16:55.166 --> 16:57.834
Go, James! Go, James!

17:00.700 --> 17:03.333
[Alex]<i> Both rams are down.</i>

17:00.700 --> 17:03.333
<i>It's time to rock.</i>

17:03.433 --> 17:05.667
[Liam]<i> You need to generate</i>

17:03.433 --> 17:05.667
<i>enough momentum</i>

17:05.767 --> 17:09.066
<i>to get that 350-pound ram</i>

17:05.767 --> 17:09.066
<i>through the giant door.</i>

17:10.133 --> 17:12.433
<i>You see Mike Evans</i>

17:10.133 --> 17:12.433
<i>using those long arms,</i>

17:12.533 --> 17:14.834
<i>that 6'5" frame to swing it.</i>

17:20.667 --> 17:21.967
[groans]

17:22.867 --> 17:24.500
But on the other side,

17:24.600 --> 17:26.600
James Jean-Louis

17:24.600 --> 17:26.600
knows the further back

17:26.700 --> 17:27.900
<i>you can pull the ram,</i>

17:28.000 --> 17:30.266
<i>the more force you have</i>

17:28.000 --> 17:30.266
<i>to hit the barrier.</i>

17:34.433 --> 17:35.667
[Alex]<i> Both boards are cracking.</i>

17:35.767 --> 17:37.633
<i>Who's gonna</i>

17:35.767 --> 17:37.633
<i>break through first?</i>

17:41.300 --> 17:42.200
[grunts]

17:43.266 --> 17:44.900
<i>James Jean-Louis goes through,</i>

17:45.000 --> 17:47.300
<i>and he manages to grab</i>

17:45.000 --> 17:47.300
<i>the victory chain.</i>

17:47.400 --> 17:50.367
<i>Now Mike breaks through,</i>

17:47.400 --> 17:50.367
<i>but it's too late.</i>

17:50.467 --> 17:51.400
I did this!

17:51.500 --> 17:53.633
-Yeah!

17:51.500 --> 17:53.633
-[cheering]

17:54.600 --> 17:56.367
[James] Good job, baby.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.367
Good job.

17:56.467 --> 18:00.333
The Haitian Sensation

17:56.467 --> 18:00.333
kicks that ass.

18:00.433 --> 18:02.033
[laughs]

18:02.133 --> 18:04.500
Come on, baby. Come on.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.333
Come on!

18:04.600 --> 18:07.333
I did this for you, dawg!

18:07.433 --> 18:09.967
I told you, man.

18:10.066 --> 18:14.433
[Alex]<i> James Jean-Louis says</i>

18:10.066 --> 18:14.433
<i>his son is his inspiration.</i>

18:14.533 --> 18:16.233
We came all the way.

18:17.633 --> 18:18.633
I love you, man.

18:18.734 --> 18:20.033
[Jean] That's what

18:18.734 --> 18:20.033
I'm talking about!

18:20.133 --> 18:21.300
[James] I love you, man.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.900
[Liam]<i> Now, he's one step</i>

18:21.400 --> 18:23.900
<i>closer to showing Semaj</i>

18:24.000 --> 18:25.700
<i>that Daddy can be a Titan.</i>

18:28.000 --> 18:29.934
[dramatic music]

18:32.567 --> 18:35.066
There it is, Mount Olympus.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.000
Tonight, right here,

18:37.100 --> 18:40.400
one woman and one man,

18:37.100 --> 18:40.400
will be crowned Titans.

18:41.166 --> 18:42.934
Now, I told my Titan engineers,

18:43.033 --> 18:44.834
I want

18:43.033 --> 18:44.834
the physical manifestation

18:44.934 --> 18:47.300
of what it would look like

18:44.934 --> 18:47.300
if Mount Everest

18:47.400 --> 18:49.333
-had a baby with Godzilla.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.333
-[laughter]

18:49.433 --> 18:50.767
But look, here's the thing.

18:50.867 --> 18:53.400
We don't give away a chance

18:50.867 --> 18:53.400
to have a baby with Godzilla.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.767
No, you got to earn

18:53.500 --> 18:55.767
that special prize,

18:55.867 --> 18:58.600
and you do that by winning

18:55.867 --> 18:58.600
this next challenge.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.000

<i>to be headed for Titan glory.</i>

19:09.467 --> 19:11.033
<i>I was a chubby one.</i>

<i>I weighed about 262 pounds.</i>

19:14.233 --> 19:16.633
<i>My size</i>

19:14.233 --> 19:16.633

28:08.834 --> 28:11.667

28:11.767 --> 28:13.500
[Liam]<i> Aim plays a role here.</i>

28:13.600 --> 28:16.000
<i>You need to strike dead center</i>

28:13.600 --> 28:16.000
<i>to move the post</i>

28:16.100 --> 28:17.533
<i>and release the ram.</i>

28:18.633 --> 28:20.700
-Yeah! Yeah!

28:18.633 --> 28:20.700
<i>-And there it is for Julie.</i>

28:20.800 --> 28:25.300
<i>The ram is down, but remember,</i>

<i>it's 350 pounds.</i>

28:27.400 --> 28:29.467
<i>And now Tina's ram is down.</i>

28:29.567 --> 28:31.066
[Alex]<i> Julie, though,</i>

28:29.567 --> 28:31.066

28:31.166 --> 28:32.734

28:31.166 --> 28:32.734
<i>as a firefighter.</i>

28:32.834 --> 28:34.834
<i>She is gonna crash</i>

28:34.934 --> 28:36.633
[grunting]

28:36.734 --> 28:38.800
[Liam]<i> Tina's working</i>

28:36.734 --> 28:38.800
<i>to build up momentum,</i>

28:38.900 --> 28:41.233
<i>but she's gripping that rope</i>

28:38.900 --> 28:41.233
<i>a little high,</i>

28:41.333 --> 28:43.700
<i>which makes it hard</i>

28:41.333 --> 28:43.700
<i>to get wide swings.</i>

28:46.333 --> 28:49.266
[Alex]<i> Look at the momentum</i>

28:46.333 --> 28:49.266
<i>Julie's generating right now.</i>

28:49.367 --> 28:50.900
<i>She's staying low</i>

28:51.000 --> 28:53.133
<i>Oh, Julie is through.</i>

28:56.467 --> 28:58.700
<i>And she has pulled</i>

28:56.467 --> 28:58.700
<i>the victory chain.</i>

28:58.800 --> 29:02.767
<i>Wow, I cannot believe it!</i>

29:02.867 --> 29:04.633
Can your grandmother do that?

29:08.133 --> 29:10.100
That's amazing. [chuckles]

29:10.200 --> 29:13.500
[Alex]<i> Julie Dudley,</i>

You did it, baby.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.500
Oh, you did it.

[Liam]<i> 50-year-old Julie Dudley</i>

29:38.633 --> 29:39.834

<i>because we're about to crown</i>

29:39.934 --> 29:42.800
<i>our first Titan.</i>

29:42.900 --> 29:46.166
[Liam]<i> And that means we're</i>

29:42.900 --> 29:46.166
<i>about to get our first look</i>

29:46.266 --> 29:48.900
<i>at mighty Mount Olympus.</i>

29:49.967 --> 29:52.400
[Dwayne] In Greek Mythology,

29:49.967 --> 29:52.400
Mount Olympus

29:52.500 --> 29:55.400
was where the Gods battled for

29:52.500 --> 29:55.400
control over the ancient world.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.433
Well, here, it's where

29:55.500 --> 29:58.433
our winners battle each other

29:58.533 --> 30:00.133
and new legends are created.

30:02.266 --> 30:05.700
[Dwayne]<i> Mount Olympus is the</i>

30:02.266 --> 30:05.700
<i>crown jewel in the Titan Arena.</i>

30:05.800 --> 30:08.800
<i>From the strength required</i>

30:05.800 --> 30:08.800
<i>to push over a half-ton wall</i>

30:08.900 --> 30:13.133
<i>and drive 450 pounds</i>

30:08.900 --> 30:13.133
<i>up a 25-degree incline...</i>

30:13.233 --> 30:15.900
<i>to the agility to climb</i>

30:13.233 --> 30:15.900
<i>over six spinning cylinders,</i>

30:16.000 --> 30:19.066
<i>each wider than</i>

30:16.000 --> 30:19.066
<i>a redwood tree.</i>

30:19.166 --> 30:21.967
<i>Each stage of Mount Olympus</i>

30:19.166 --> 30:21.967
<i>has been specially designed</i>

30:22.066 --> 30:25.367
<i>to test all aspects</i>

30:22.066 --> 30:25.367
<i>of athleticism.</i>

30:25.467 --> 30:28.433
<i>If you have a weakness,</i>

30:25.467 --> 30:28.433
<i>the mountain's gonna reveal it.</i>

30:29.367 --> 30:31.200
<i>Prove that you can conquer</i>

30:29.367 --> 30:31.200
<i>my mountain,</i>

30:31.300 --> 30:33.100
<i>and you join my team of Titans.</i>

30:34.400 --> 30:36.033
[dramatic music]

30:42.200 --> 30:43.233
Earlier tonight,

30:43.333 --> 30:45.433
we witnessed two

30:43.333 --> 30:45.433
badass athletes from Florida,

30:45.533 --> 30:49.300
a truck driver

30:45.533 --> 30:49.300
and a soldier shine in victory.

30:49.400 --> 30:53.400
Now James Jean-Louis

30:49.400 --> 30:53.400
and Anthony Fuhrman

30:53.500 --> 30:54.934
will face off against each other

30:55.033 --> 30:57.767
to earn the historic title

30:55.033 --> 30:57.767
of Titan.

31:00.333 --> 31:02.233
<i>I'm up against James</i>

31:00.333 --> 31:02.233
<i>going to Mount Olympus,</i>

31:02.333 --> 31:03.900
and as a competitor,

31:02.333 --> 31:03.900
he is very tough.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.667
[Liam]<i> James Jean-Louis</i>

31:04.000 --> 31:06.667
<i>is getting the hang of it.</i>

31:07.600 --> 31:09.066
[Anthony]<i> Very determined,</i>

31:07.600 --> 31:09.066
<i>very athletic,</i>

31:09.166 --> 31:11.567
<i>but he's also never competed</i>

31:09.166 --> 31:11.567
<i>against anyone like me.</i>

31:11.667 --> 31:13.166
[James]<i> Anthony is</i>

31:11.667 --> 31:13.166
<i>a real powerlifter.</i>

31:13.266 --> 31:14.400
<i>I mean, he's strong.</i>

31:14.500 --> 31:17.700
<i>-Anthony just destroys it.</i>

31:14.500 --> 31:17.700
<i>-Pure raw power.</i>

31:17.800 --> 31:20.233
But I have more to prove.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.233
This one is for me,

31:20.333 --> 31:22.433
<i>my son and everybody</i>

31:20.333 --> 31:22.433
<i>that doubted me as well.</i>

31:22.533 --> 31:25.200
It's time to shine

31:22.533 --> 31:25.200
and conquer Mount Olympus.

31:28.800 --> 31:32.100
All right, James, Anthony,

31:28.800 --> 31:32.100
I had a mission for this show,

31:32.200 --> 31:33.266
find everyday people

31:33.367 --> 31:35.400
with extraordinary

31:33.367 --> 31:35.400
athletic abilities

31:35.500 --> 31:36.834
and give them a platform.

31:36.934 --> 31:39.600
Well, this right here

31:36.934 --> 31:39.600
is the ultimate platform,

31:39.700 --> 31:41.433
and how you got here

31:39.700 --> 31:41.433
was very impressive,

31:41.533 --> 31:43.100
but when this whole thing

31:41.533 --> 31:43.100
is over,

31:43.200 --> 31:44.800
only one of you

31:43.200 --> 31:44.800
will be leaving a Titan.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.633
This is your second chance,

31:44.900 --> 31:46.633
baby. Come on.

31:46.734 --> 31:49.266
[Dwayne] Dig deep.

31:46.734 --> 31:49.266
Lay it all out on the line.

31:49.367 --> 31:51.200
This is Mount Olympus.

32:09.734 --> 32:12.567
<i>each one 150 pounds.</i>

<i>450 pounds up a ski slope.</i>

32:25.066 --> 32:26.867
<i>Mount Olympus is the ultimate</i>

<i>proving ground.</i>

32:26.967 --> 32:30.800
<i>You need strength, speed,</i>

32:26.967 --> 32:30.800
<i>agility, and endurance.</i>

32:30.900 --> 32:33.433
<i>We know that James Jean-Louis</i>

<i>has the agility,</i>

<i>and he proved it right there</i>

32:35.133 --> 32:37.934
<i>by flying through</i>

32:35.133 --> 32:37.934
<i>the Rolling Ascent.</i>

32:38.033 --> 32:40.433
Wow, James is like a cat.

32:41.166 --> 32:43.533
[Liam]<i> But here comes Fuhrman,</i>

<i>your own path to the top,</i>

32:53.333 --> 32:54.734
<i>but if you make</i>

<i>Right there.</i>

<i>to descend Mount Olympus.</i>

34:03.000 --> 34:04.667
[Liam]<i> You want</i>

<i>But oh! Hard landing.</i>

-Go, James! Go, James!

35:08.934 --> 35:10.900
[Alex]<i> Anthony Fuhrman</i>

35:08.934 --> 35:10.900
<i>has disappeared.</i>

35:11.000 --> 35:12.667
<i>He hit the bottom</i>

35:11.000 --> 35:12.667
<i>on that second slide</i>

35:12.767 --> 35:14.200
<i>and never came back up.</i>

35:15.500 --> 35:16.834
[Liam]<i> There he is.</i>

35:16.934 --> 35:20.066
[Alex]<i> James Jean-Louis now</i>

35:16.934 --> 35:20.066
<i>starts to toil away at the tomb</i>

35:20.166 --> 35:23.266
<i>to pull out that relic</i>

35:20.166 --> 35:23.266
<i>and become a Titan.</i>

35:23.367 --> 35:24.567
<i>Anthony Fuhrman, though,</i>

35:24.667 --> 35:27.266
<i>he's getting shut down</i>

35:24.667 --> 35:27.266
<i>at that second wall.</i>

35:29.967 --> 35:33.166
[Liam]<i> He's broken through.</i>

35:29.967 --> 35:33.166
<i>He's digging around.</i>

35:33.266 --> 35:34.967
<i>Just trying to find that relic.</i>

35:35.066 --> 35:36.333
[cheering]

35:36.433 --> 35:38.500
[Alex]<i> Anthony Fuhrman</i>

35:36.433 --> 35:38.500
<i>hasn't gotten up.</i>

35:38.600 --> 35:41.633
<i>Anthony Fuhrman hasn't</i>

35:38.600 --> 35:41.633
<i>gotten up from Mount Olympus.</i>

35:41.734 --> 35:43.266
<i>He hasn't gotten up</i>

35:41.734 --> 35:43.266
<i>from Mount Olympus.</i>

35:43.367 --> 35:47.500
<i>Meanwhile, James Jean-Louis,</i>

35:43.367 --> 35:47.500
<i>he has the relic.</i>

35:47.600 --> 35:51.233
-Come on. Come on.

35:47.600 --> 35:51.233
<i>-He punches it in.</i>

35:51.333 --> 35:55.400
<i>And James Jean-Louis</i>

35:51.333 --> 35:55.400
<i>is our first Titan!</i>

35:55.500 --> 35:57.834
[inspirational music]

35:57.934 --> 36:01.200
Congratulations.

35:57.934 --> 36:01.200
Great job, homey. Great job.

36:13.967 --> 36:15.400
[Alex]<i> You talk</i>

36:13.967 --> 36:15.400
<i>about everyday heroes.</i>

36:15.500 --> 36:18.433
<i>This is not</i>

36:15.500 --> 36:18.433
<i>your everyday truck driver.</i>

36:18.533 --> 36:20.133
Come on. Go see your family.

36:21.734 --> 36:26.133
<i>James Jean-Louis</i>

36:21.734 --> 36:26.133
<i>dominated Mount Olympus.</i>

36:26.233 --> 36:30.200
<i>Mount Olympus, too strong</i>

36:26.233 --> 36:30.200
<i>for this super-strong man.</i>

36:31.000 --> 36:33.633
I love you, man.

36:34.734 --> 36:37.166
Oh, my gosh. Hallelujah.

36:37.266 --> 36:38.433
[James] I love you, man.

36:40.700 --> 36:41.767
I love you.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.800
[Liam]<i> James Jean-Louis</i>

36:46.500 --> 36:48.800
<i>proved it takes more</i>

36:48.900 --> 36:52.333
<i>than brute strength</i>

36:48.900 --> 36:52.333
<i>to beat the mountain.</i>

36:52.433 --> 36:54.834
<i>We'll see this hard-working dad</i>

36:52.433 --> 36:54.834
<i>in a few weeks</i>

36:54.934 --> 36:56.300
<i>in our battle of the Titans,</i>

36:56.400 --> 36:58.867
<i>but right now,</i>

36:56.400 --> 36:58.867
<i>he's standing by with Cari.</i>

37:00.300 --> 37:02.667
James, we know your story.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.667
You've been through a lot.

37:02.767 --> 37:05.066
You talk about second chances.

37:02.767 --> 37:05.066
For those at home tonight

37:05.166 --> 37:07.066
who want a second chance,

37:05.166 --> 37:07.066
what do you say to them?

37:07.166 --> 37:08.500
To anybody that want

37:07.166 --> 37:08.500
a second chance, man,

37:08.600 --> 37:10.033
stay focused

37:08.600 --> 37:10.033
with your dreams, man.

37:10.133 --> 37:13.367
Don't give up.

37:10.133 --> 37:13.367
I realized that, you know what,

37:13.467 --> 37:15.500
I want to be the role model

37:13.467 --> 37:15.500
that my son looks up to,

37:15.600 --> 37:18.467
and that's what gave me

37:15.600 --> 37:18.467
that drive to be here today.

37:18.567 --> 37:20.133
When you got that dream,

37:18.567 --> 37:20.133
stay strong on it.

37:20.233 --> 37:22.700
Keep going. Keep pushing.

37:20.233 --> 37:22.700
It's gonna happen.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.700
Let's make it official.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.700
Go talk to DJ.

37:27.233 --> 37:28.433
Come on, brother.

37:27.233 --> 37:28.433
Come on. Come on.

37:28.533 --> 37:29.934
-Thank you, man.

37:28.533 --> 37:29.934
-I'm proud of you, brother,

37:30.033 --> 37:31.934
-Thank you, man. Thank you.

37:30.033 --> 37:31.934
-Come here. Good job.

37:32.033 --> 37:33.266
Thank you for this opportunity,

37:32.033 --> 37:33.266
man.

37:33.367 --> 37:34.567
I appreciate you for giving me

37:33.367 --> 37:34.567
this platform.

37:34.667 --> 37:35.934
-You're very welcome.

37:34.667 --> 37:35.934
-I appreciate you.

37:36.033 --> 37:37.300
Get that cheat meal in now,

37:36.033 --> 37:37.300
all right?

37:37.400 --> 37:39.467
-Of course, of course.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.467
-Come on. [laughing]

37:40.967 --> 37:43.467
Stick around.

37:40.967 --> 37:43.467
More<i> Titan Games</i> to come.

37:47.133 --> 37:48.934
[Liam]<i> Welcome back</i>

37:47.133 --> 37:48.934
<i>to Titan Arena.</i>

37:49.033 --> 37:50.667
<i>It's time to crown</i>

37:49.033 --> 37:50.667
<i>another Titan.</i>

37:50.767 --> 37:51.900
<i>Here's DJ.</i>

37:52.834 --> 37:54.667
Becoming a Titan

37:52.834 --> 37:54.667
is only the beginning

37:54.767 --> 37:56.667
for these amazing athletes.

37:56.767 --> 37:58.967
At the end of this season,

37:56.767 --> 37:58.967
they will all return

37:59.066 --> 38:01.000
for the epic

37:59.066 --> 38:01.000
Battle of the Titans.

38:01.100 --> 38:03.867
When it's all over,

38:01.100 --> 38:03.867
one man and one woman

38:03.967 --> 38:05.433
will earn the distinction

38:05.533 --> 38:09.100
of becoming

38:05.533 --> 38:09.100
the first-ever Titan Champions.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.300
Now, a match I have been

38:09.200 --> 38:11.300
looking forward to

38:11.400 --> 38:14.200
between two

38:11.400 --> 38:14.200
extraordinary athletes,

38:14.300 --> 38:16.767
the human Pit Bull,

38:14.300 --> 38:16.767
Emily Andzulis,

38:16.867 --> 38:20.266
versus the badass firefighter,

38:16.867 --> 38:20.266
Julie Dudley.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.166
<i>Going into Mount Olympus</i>

38:22.834 --> 38:25.166
<i>against Julie,</i>

38:25.266 --> 38:27.900
<i>what gives me an edge</i>

38:25.266 --> 38:27.900
<i>is that never-give-up attitude.</i>

38:28.000 --> 38:29.567
[Alex]<i> Emily, the Pit Bull.</i>

38:29.667 --> 38:32.500
I've done martial arts

38:29.667 --> 38:32.500
my whole life, and I'm ready.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.567
<i>I just beat</i>

38:32.600 --> 38:34.567
<i>somebody half my age,</i>

38:34.667 --> 38:36.166
and I won't lie. It felt good.

38:36.266 --> 38:38.734
[Alex]<i> I cannot believe it.</i>

38:38.834 --> 38:40.567
<i>I'm not</i>

38:38.834 --> 38:40.567
<i>your average grandmother.</i>

38:40.667 --> 38:42.166
I can't wait to kick some butt.

38:45.166 --> 38:46.567
I'm pumped up for this one.

38:46.667 --> 38:50.233
Emily, Julie, your drive

38:46.667 --> 38:50.233
and competitive fire

38:50.333 --> 38:53.467
are exactly the same,

38:50.333 --> 38:53.467
and that's why I chose you.

38:53.567 --> 38:55.867
This is your chance

38:53.567 --> 38:55.867
to make Titan history.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.266
Show everyone watching

38:57.367 --> 39:00.467
why women are unstoppable

38:57.367 --> 39:00.467
forces of nature.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.367
[dramatic music]

39:06.967 --> 39:08.900
[Liam]<i> Emily in the red,</i>

39:06.967 --> 39:08.900
<i>Julie in the blue,</i>

39:09.000 --> 39:10.266
<i>and they're off and running</i>

39:10.367 --> 39:12.033
<i>and trying to attack</i>

39:10.367 --> 39:12.033
<i>that wall.</i>

39:12.133 --> 39:16.200
[Alex]<i> Let's see how they</i>

39:12.133 --> 39:16.200
<i>tackle the 1,000-pound wall.</i>

39:16.300 --> 39:20.200
<i>Julie Dudley tears it down.</i>

39:16.300 --> 39:20.200
<i>So impressive.</i>

39:20.300 --> 39:22.300
<i>But Emily not far behind.</i>

39:22.400 --> 39:24.367
[Liam]<i> They get</i>

39:22.400 --> 39:24.367
<i>to the Gates of Olympus.</i>

39:24.467 --> 39:26.200
<i>Julie's using all arms...</i>

39:26.300 --> 39:28.567
<i>but Emily's</i>

39:26.300 --> 39:28.567
<i>driving with her legs.</i>

39:28.667 --> 39:30.734
[Alex]<i> Digging her feet,</i>

39:28.667 --> 39:30.734
<i>putting it in those grooves,</i>

39:30.834 --> 39:34.567
<i>driving each</i>

39:30.834 --> 39:34.567
<i>150-pound gate higher.</i>

39:34.667 --> 39:36.367
[Liam]<i> She's got</i>

39:34.667 --> 39:36.367
<i>all three of them off.</i>

39:36.467 --> 39:38.934
[Alex]<i> Julie Dudley,</i>

39:36.467 --> 39:38.934
<i>not there yet...</i>

39:41.066 --> 39:44.066
But Emily is flying though--

39:41.066 --> 39:44.066
Oh, I spoke too soon!

39:44.166 --> 39:46.300
She was going through

39:44.166 --> 39:46.300
the Rolling Ascent very quickly,

39:46.400 --> 39:48.500
but it's tricky.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.500
It'll catch you out of nowhere,

39:48.600 --> 39:50.400
and before you know it,

39:48.600 --> 39:50.400
you're on the floor.

39:50.500 --> 39:53.133
[Liam]<i> Still plenty of time</i>

39:50.500 --> 39:53.133
<i>for Julie to catch up,</i>

39:53.233 --> 39:54.400
<i>but Emily has the early lead...</i>

39:54.500 --> 39:56.767
Let's go!

39:56.867 --> 39:58.467
<i>and now she's at The Cliffs.</i>

40:00.433 --> 40:03.734
[Alex]<i> Oh, and a front kick</i>

40:00.433 --> 40:03.734
<i>from the MMA fighter.</i>

40:03.834 --> 40:05.400
Wow! Come on, Emily.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.934
<i>And here comes Julie</i>

40:05.500 --> 40:07.934
<i>trying to stay low,</i>

40:08.033 --> 40:11.033
<i>but the log's spinning,</i>

40:08.033 --> 40:11.033
<i>and she's down.</i>

40:11.133 --> 40:14.266
<i>Emily, punching and kicking it</i>

40:11.133 --> 40:14.266
<i>halfway to the top.</i>

40:14.367 --> 40:16.567
<i>What twisted mind</i>

40:14.367 --> 40:16.567
<i>designed this course?</i>

40:16.667 --> 40:18.467
[laughing]

40:18.567 --> 40:20.266
[Liam]<i> Julie, meanwhile,</i>

40:18.567 --> 40:20.266
<i>having trouble</i>

40:20.367 --> 40:23.533
<i>getting far enough forward.</i>

40:20.367 --> 40:23.533
<i>Those logs are four feet wide.</i>

40:23.633 --> 40:25.800
Come on, Babe!

40:23.633 --> 40:25.800
Pull yourself up! Come on!

40:25.900 --> 40:27.367
[Liam]<i> One thing that Emily's</i>

40:25.900 --> 40:27.367
<i>not worried about</i>

40:27.467 --> 40:29.500
<i>is punching holes</i>

40:27.467 --> 40:29.500
<i>in that Cliff.</i>

40:29.600 --> 40:30.667
<i>With the MMA background,</i>

40:30.767 --> 40:33.567
<i>she's smashing through</i>

40:30.767 --> 40:33.567
<i>and climbing up.</i>

40:33.667 --> 40:35.734
<i>And Julie's through.</i>

40:35.834 --> 40:37.467
Yeah! Come on!

40:37.567 --> 40:39.700
Get up there! Get up there!

40:37.567 --> 40:39.700
Let's go!

40:39.800 --> 40:41.734
[Alex]<i> But Emily</i>

40:39.800 --> 40:41.734
<i>reaches the top.</i>

40:41.834 --> 40:44.066
<i>Now it's over</i>

40:41.834 --> 40:44.066
<i>to our next obstacle,</i>

40:44.166 --> 40:46.433
<i>where you've got</i>

40:44.166 --> 40:46.433
<i>to raise the torch.</i>

40:46.533 --> 40:50.767
<i>That's 600 pounds, more than</i>

40:46.533 --> 40:50.767
<i>four times her body weight.</i>

40:52.133 --> 40:53.800
Let's go, Julie.

40:53.900 --> 40:55.533
[Liam]<i> Julie's not out of this.</i>

40:55.633 --> 40:59.000
<i>She can catch up if she</i>

40:55.633 --> 40:59.000
<i>climbs up The Cliffs quickly.</i>

41:02.066 --> 41:04.100
[Alex]<i> Emily finds</i>

41:02.066 --> 41:04.100
<i>a second wind.</i>

41:04.200 --> 41:05.433
<i>Her torch is lit.</i>

41:05.533 --> 41:08.200
And she's gonna start

41:05.533 --> 41:08.200
descending down Mount Olympus

41:08.300 --> 41:10.133
here as she hits those walls,

41:10.233 --> 41:13.000
five feet, six feet, seven feet.

41:13.100 --> 41:15.633
<i>She's only 5'2", Liam.</i>

41:18.567 --> 41:21.033
[Liam]<i> Julie, still fighting.</i>

41:21.133 --> 41:24.233
[Alex]<i> Emily's approaching</i>

41:21.133 --> 41:24.233
<i>the Titan floor.</i>

41:24.333 --> 41:26.967
<i>Now, it's on</i>

41:24.333 --> 41:26.967
<i>to the Ball and Chain.</i>

41:27.066 --> 41:29.300
<i>But she's only 130 pounds.</i>

41:29.400 --> 41:32.266
<i>How's she gonna drag</i>

41:29.400 --> 41:32.266
<i>200 pounds of metal?</i>

41:35.166 --> 41:37.300
[Liam]<i> Just like that.</i>

41:37.400 --> 41:39.533
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

41:39.633 --> 41:41.934
[Alex]<i> Are you kidding me?</i>

41:46.567 --> 41:48.900
<i>Go! Go! All you got!</i>

41:49.934 --> 41:53.166
[Alex]<i> My goodness!</i>

41:49.934 --> 41:53.166
<i>She's reached the tomb!</i>

41:53.266 --> 41:55.867
[Liam]<i> Julie's now</i>

41:53.266 --> 41:55.867
<i>up top Mount Olympus</i>

41:55.967 --> 41:57.433
<i>trying to raise the torch,</i>

41:57.533 --> 41:59.700
<i>trying to finish strong,</i>

41:57.533 --> 41:59.700
<i>but right now,</i>

41:59.800 --> 42:04.000
<i>this one is all</i>

41:59.800 --> 42:04.000
<i>about Emily Andzulis.</i>

42:04.533 --> 42:05.533
Come on, Emily.

42:06.500 --> 42:09.066
[Alex]<i> Emily is</i>

42:06.500 --> 42:09.066
<i>a few swings away</i>

42:09.166 --> 42:13.367
<i>from breaking open</i>

-Thank you so much.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.900
You did it. You're amazing.

43:09.667 --> 43:11.867
So, Emily,

43:09.667 --> 43:11.867
you got family watching,

43:11.967 --> 43:13.533
your sister specifically.

43:13.633 --> 43:14.934
Anything you want

43:13.633 --> 43:14.934
to say to her?

43:15.033 --> 43:17.333
Oh, God. Um...

43:17.433 --> 43:21.100
she's my person.

43:17.433 --> 43:21.100
She's been by my side every--

43:21.200 --> 43:24.266
through every obstacle,

43:21.200 --> 43:24.266
and I love her a lot, so...

43:24.367 --> 43:26.467
You made her proud tonight.

43:24.367 --> 43:26.467
Let's make this official.

43:26.567 --> 43:28.166
DJ, you have something for her?

43:28.266 --> 43:30.200
Come on up.

43:31.700 --> 43:34.000
Come on. Here you go.

43:34.100 --> 43:36.433
You've earned our respect.

43:34.100 --> 43:36.433
Congratulations. You're a Titan.

43:36.533 --> 43:37.800
-Thank you so much!

43:36.533 --> 43:37.800
-Absolutely.

43:40.033 --> 43:41.400
[Liam]<i> So James and Emily</i>

43:41.500 --> 43:43.033

43:43.133 --> 43:45.000
<i>Each week, we'll add two more.</i>

43:45.100 --> 43:48.100
<i>Then they'll all face off</i>

43:45.100 --> 43:48.100
<i>in the Battle of the Titans.</i>

43:48.200 --> 43:51.533
<i>In the end, we'll crown</i>

[Alex]<i> That's right, DJ.</i>

-Hi, what's your name?

44:07.433 --> 44:09.400
-Zenia.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.333
Zenia? What a pretty name.

44:11.433 --> 44:12.867
I'm Kevin Hart.

44:12.967 --> 44:14.200
[laughter]

44:14.300 --> 44:16.233
It's good to meet you.

44:14.300 --> 44:16.233
Are you having fun tonight?

44:16.333 --> 44:17.600
-Mm-hmm.

44:16.333 --> 44:17.600
-Awesome.

44:17.700 --> 44:19.333
Who are you here to see?

44:17.700 --> 44:19.333
Are you here with a competitor,

44:19.433 --> 44:21.467
or are you here just to hang out

44:19.433 --> 44:21.467
and have the best time?

44:21.567 --> 44:25.367
Who are you here to see?

44:21.567 --> 44:25.367
Oh, to see me! Oh, my gosh!

44:25.467 --> 44:27.533
Thank you so much.

44:25.467 --> 44:27.533
I appreciate it.

44:27.633 --> 44:31.066
Thank you. Thank you.

44:27.633 --> 44:31.066
Have fun. Good to meet you.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.667
All right, let's get to work.

44:35.600 --> 44:36.633
[Liam]<i> All right, DJ.</i>

44:36.734 --> 44:39.000
<i>We've got four men</i>

44:36.734 --> 44:39.000

44:39.100 --> 44:41.800
<i>prepared to face off</i>

44:43.700 --> 44:45.767
[Alex]<i> We'll see</i>

44:43.700 --> 44:45.767
<i>three new epic challenges,</i>

44:45.867 --> 44:47.533

<i>will square off</i>

44:53.533 --> 44:55.600
<i>to Cari Champion.</i>

44:56.500 --> 44:57.734
All right, guys, so listen up.

44:57.834 --> 45:00.367
These next competitors

44:57.834 --> 45:00.367
are bringing both brains

45:00.467 --> 45:02.133
and brawn to the competition.

45:02.233 --> 45:05.400
One's a high school sports star

45:02.233 --> 45:05.400
turned medical student.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.033
The other is, check this out,

45:07.133 --> 45:11.000
a satellite engineer

45:07.133 --> 45:11.000
who's also a killer athlete?

45:12.900 --> 45:15.834
<i>Titan competitors come</i>

45:12.900 --> 45:15.834
<i>from all walks of life.</i>

<i>mechanical engineer</i>

45:19.066 --> 45:20.433

45:20.533 --> 45:22.934

45:20.533 --> 45:22.934

45:23.033 --> 45:25.767
<i>I feel like I represent</i>

45:23.033 --> 45:25.767
<i>all the nerds behind the desk.</i>

45:25.867 --> 45:30.066
[Cari]<i> But some Titan hopefuls</i>

45:25.867 --> 45:30.066
<i>spend their days in disguise.</i>

45:30.166 --> 45:32.200
<i>I come to work, you know,</i>

45:30.166 --> 45:32.200

<i>put on a cut-off T-shirt,</i>

45:37.533 --> 45:39.500
<i>chalk up my hands.</i>

45:39.600 --> 45:40.867
<i>I'm a freaking beast.</i>

45:43.166 --> 45:46.133
<i>My fiancée, Shanny Lee,</i>

45:43.166 --> 45:46.133
<i>she'll do, like,</i>

45:46.233 --> 45:48.233
<i>powerlifting stuff with me.</i>

45:48.333 --> 45:51.467
We're inseparable,

45:48.333 --> 45:51.467
so she's my soul mate.

45:51.567 --> 45:54.467
I want to show

45:51.567 --> 45:54.467
that I'm not just an engineer.

45:54.567 --> 45:56.633
I'm also an athlete.

<i>"There's no substitute</i>

46:12.400 --> 46:13.700

<i>Quinn Rivera is a small-town</i>

46:23.200 --> 46:26.266
[Cari]<i> Quinn Rivera comes</i>

46:23.200 --> 46:26.266
<i>from one of the smallest towns</i>

<i>Cody, Wyoming,</i>

46:27.934 --> 46:31.934
<i>population 9,000.</i>

46:32.033 --> 46:36.266
<i>I'm very much a small-town,</i>

46:32.033 --> 46:36.266
<i>homegrown type of person.</i>

46:36.367 --> 46:38.600
<i>My high school sweetheart</i>

46:36.367 --> 46:38.600
<i>grew up, actually,</i>

46:38.700 --> 46:39.867
<i>right around the block from me.</i>

46:39.967 --> 46:41.533
We've been through a lot,

46:39.967 --> 46:41.533
baby girl,

46:41.633 --> 46:43.400
in nearly six years time,

46:43.500 --> 46:47.667
and it's helped me to see that

46:43.500 --> 46:47.667
I want you to be forever mine.

46:47.767 --> 46:50.533
We finally got married

46:47.767 --> 46:50.533
this past summer.

46:53.433 --> 46:55.700
I'm a medical student.

46:53.433 --> 46:55.700
To be a doctor, I guess,

46:55.800 --> 46:57.967
was kind of an early decision.

46:55.800 --> 46:57.967
I have two uncles

46:58.066 --> 47:00.467
and my grandfather

46:58.066 --> 47:00.467
who are all physicians.

47:00.567 --> 47:03.033
I think that's one of the most

47:00.567 --> 47:03.033
rewarding things you can do

47:03.133 --> 47:04.467
is to-- just to give back.

47:04.567 --> 47:05.834
How are we today?

47:08.667 --> 47:11.100
<i>I've always been kind of a</i>

47:08.667 --> 47:11.100
<i>small-town kid with big dreams.</i>

47:11.200 --> 47:12.700
<i>In high school</i>

47:11.200 --> 47:12.700
<i>I played football,</i>

47:12.800 --> 47:14.567
<i>and then I ran track</i>

47:12.800 --> 47:14.567
<i>in the spring.</i>

47:14.667 --> 47:16.600
[Cari]<i> Tonight,</i>

47:14.667 --> 47:16.600
<i>the pride of Cody,</i>

47:16.700 --> 47:19.700
<i>tests himself on</i>

47:16.700 --> 47:19.700
<i>the biggest stage of his life.</i>

47:19.800 --> 47:21.734
<i>It means a lot to be able</i>

47:19.800 --> 47:21.734
<i>to represent Cody</i>

47:21.834 --> 47:23.533
<i>on a competition of this scale.</i>

47:23.633 --> 47:25.834
<i>This is an opportunity</i>

47:23.633 --> 47:25.834
<i>of a lifetime.</i>

47:25.934 --> 47:27.100
I will be a Titan.

47:34.233 --> 47:37.100
[Liam]<i> So we have a</i>

47:34.233 --> 47:37.100
<i>medicine man and a rocket man.</i>

47:37.200 --> 47:39.867
[Alex]<i> The perfect pair</i>

47:37.200 --> 47:39.867
<i>to launch this next challenge.</i>

47:39.967 --> 47:41.834
[Liam]<i> Take it away, DJ.</i>

47:41.934 --> 47:44.934
So I wanted this challenge

47:41.934 --> 47:44.934
to look like a crazy,

47:45.033 --> 47:46.300
old-school video game.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.967
I wanted our athletes

47:46.400 --> 47:48.967
to feel like they were kids

47:49.066 --> 47:51.800
testing the limits

47:49.066 --> 47:51.800
of their imaginations,

47:51.900 --> 47:54.834
but there's no extra lives

47:51.900 --> 47:54.834
on<i> The Titan Games.</i>

47:54.934 --> 47:56.667
You lose, it's game over.

47:59.166 --> 48:01.700
[Alex]<i> DJ designed</i>

47:59.166 --> 48:01.700
<i>an absurd agility course</i>

48:01.800 --> 48:04.900
<i>testing lower-body power</i>

48:01.800 --> 48:04.900
<i>and forearm grip strength</i>

48:05.000 --> 48:10.467
<i>as you use a giant silver pole</i>

48:05.000 --> 48:10.467
<i>to span five 15-foot gaps.</i>

48:10.567 --> 48:13.033
<i>To free the golden pole,</i>

48:10.567 --> 48:13.033
<i>you must push off weight</i>

48:13.133 --> 48:16.100
<i>that's equivalent</i>

48:13.133 --> 48:16.100
<i>to three washing machines.</i>

48:16.200 --> 48:19.867
[Liam]<i> Then showcase your speed</i>

48:16.200 --> 48:19.867
<i>by vaulting your way back,</i>

48:19.967 --> 48:22.433
<i>climb and reach</i>

48:19.967 --> 48:22.433
<i>for the victory chain</i>

48:22.533 --> 48:24.867
<i>that sends you</i>

48:22.533 --> 48:24.867
<i>to Mount Olympus.</i>

48:30.233 --> 48:32.300
Quinn and Thong,

48:32.400 --> 48:34.467
you both came here

48:32.400 --> 48:34.467
with something to prove.

48:34.567 --> 48:36.567
The chance to shine is now.

48:36.667 --> 48:39.567
Time to fly.

48:36.667 --> 48:39.567

48:48.033 --> 48:49.633
<i>what you need.</i>

48:49.734 --> 48:51.400
<i>You need to commit</i>

48:49.734 --> 48:51.400
<i>and just hope</i>

48:51.500 --> 48:55.333
<i>that you don't make</i>

48:51.500 --> 48:55.333

48:56.066 --> 48:57.433
Come on, baby.

49:17.700 --> 49:20.367
<i>for brute strength.</i>

49:20.467 --> 49:22.567
<i>Those blocks</i>

49:20.467 --> 49:22.567
<i>increase in weight,</i>

49:22.667 --> 49:24.834
<i>starting at 200 pounds,</i>

49:24.934 --> 49:27.834
<i>and that last one</i>

49:24.934 --> 49:27.834
<i>is 300 pounds.</i>

49:29.867 --> 49:32.400
<i>And Thong nearly trips</i>

49:29.867 --> 49:32.400
<i>over his silver pole.</i>

49:32.500 --> 49:34.633
<i>That could be the difference</i>

49:32.500 --> 49:34.633
<i>in the race.</i>

49:36.000 --> 49:38.100
[Liam]<i> This isn't just about</i>

49:36.000 --> 49:38.100
<i>upper-body strength.</i>

49:38.200 --> 49:40.667
<i>You need balance to land</i>

49:38.200 --> 49:40.667
<i>and keep moving.</i>

49:41.867 --> 49:44.734
[Alex]<i> Oh, Thong La just</i>

49:41.867 --> 49:44.734
<i>tripped for that brief moment.</i>

49:44.834 --> 49:46.033
Let's go, boys.

49:46.133 --> 49:47.533
[Alex]<i> Quinn needs</i>

49:46.133 --> 49:47.533
<i>to take advantage of this.</i>

49:47.633 --> 49:51.000
[Liam]<i> And he is. Quinn</i>

49:47.633 --> 49:51.000
<i>really finding his rhythm.</i>

49:51.100 --> 49:53.200
[Alex]<i> And Thong La--</i>

49:51.100 --> 49:53.200
<i>Lands knees first.</i>

49:53.300 --> 49:55.367
<i>He's really struggling.</i>

49:55.467 --> 49:58.133
[Liam]<i> One gap to go</i>

49:55.467 --> 49:58.133
<i>for Quinn Rivera.</i>

50:00.500 --> 50:02.867
[Alex]<i> After another fall,</i>

50:00.500 --> 50:02.867
<i>Thong is not giving up,</i>

50:02.967 --> 50:05.233
<i>but the medical student</i>

50:02.967 --> 50:05.233
<i>from Cody, Wyoming,</i>

50:05.333 --> 50:08.333
<i>population 9,000,</i>

50:05.333 --> 50:08.333
<i>is going to set the pole</i>

50:08.433 --> 50:10.900
<i>and begin the climb</i>

50:08.433 --> 50:10.900
<i>to the victory chain.</i>

50:11.000 --> 50:12.467
[dramatic music]

50:14.834 --> 50:16.166
Yeah, boy!

50:19.934 --> 50:21.300
Wow!

50:28.600 --> 50:31.367
[Liam]<i> Whoa, one final leap</i>

50:28.600 --> 50:31.367
<i>for Quinn Rivera</i>

50:31.467 --> 50:33.667
<i>back with his brothers</i>

50:31.467 --> 50:33.667
<i>in the stands.</i>

50:33.767 --> 50:37.867
[Alex]<i> The small-town star</i>

50:33.767 --> 50:37.867
<i>looks ready for the big stage.</i>

50:37.967 --> 50:40.333
[Liam]<i> We'll see Quinn later</i>

50:37.967 --> 50:40.333
<i>on Mount Olympus,</i>

50:40.433 --> 50:43.900
<i>fighting for his chance</i>

50:40.433 --> 50:43.900
<i>to be a Titan.</i>

50:44.000 --> 50:46.200
Hey, man, I appreciate

50:44.000 --> 50:46.200
all you stand for, brother.

50:46.300 --> 50:48.266
Oh, absolutely, man.

50:46.300 --> 50:48.266
Great job.

50:55.433 --> 50:58.533
<i>I'm the sexiest man alive.</i>

50:58.633 --> 50:59.767
<i>That's okay. Whatever.</i>

50:59.867 --> 51:01.800
Welcome to<i> Titan Games.</i>

51:01.900 --> 51:04.633
[cheers and applause]

51:04.734 --> 51:08.800
<i>This crowd tonight.</i>

51:04.734 --> 51:08.800
<i>Titan Arena. Wow!</i>

51:09.633 --> 51:11.734
[Alex]

51:09.633 --> 51:11.734
<i>That was DJ earlier tonight.</i>

51:11.834 --> 51:14.166
<i>We've got the best hype man</i>

51:11.834 --> 51:14.166
<i>in the world, Liam.</i>

51:14.266 --> 51:16.166
[Liam]<i> You can feel</i>

51:14.266 --> 51:16.166
<i>that electricity right now.</i>

51:16.266 --> 51:18.400
This crowd is ready, DJ.

51:18.500 --> 51:20.700
All right, seriously,

51:18.500 --> 51:20.700
we got to make a home version

51:20.800 --> 51:22.767
of<i> Titan Games.</i>

51:20.800 --> 51:22.767
I'm gonna ask NBC

51:22.867 --> 51:25.767
to recreate this entire setup

51:22.867 --> 51:25.767
in my backyard

51:25.867 --> 51:27.166
so I can knock

51:25.867 --> 51:27.166
these bad boys down.

51:27.266 --> 51:28.967
You know what, go ahead

51:27.266 --> 51:28.967
and take it out of Liam

51:29.066 --> 51:30.667
and Goldenboy's salary

51:29.066 --> 51:30.667
if you have to.

51:30.767 --> 51:32.200
They said that's cool.

51:30.767 --> 51:32.200
Right, boys?

51:32.300 --> 51:35.100
There's no way that that's

51:32.300 --> 51:35.100
gonna pay for any of that.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.033
Joke's on you.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.033
I'm not getting paid.

51:37.133 --> 51:39.667
Now time for our next

51:37.133 --> 51:39.667
Titan Games battle.

51:39.767 --> 51:40.834
I'll come up there, Goldenboy.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.266
All right, guys.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.266
So in this battle,

51:43.367 --> 51:45.700
one competitor is looking

51:43.367 --> 51:45.700
to make her mark

51:45.800 --> 51:47.300
in a family of athletes.

51:47.400 --> 51:51.233
The other is a former soldier

51:47.400 --> 51:51.233
turned fearless firefighter.

51:53.734 --> 51:55.000
<i>I was 16 years old</i>

51:55.100 --> 51:57.600
<i>when my Mom cosigned me</i>

51:55.100 --> 51:57.600
<i>into the military.</i>

51:58.967 --> 52:02.000
I was in this small town

51:58.967 --> 52:02.000
where if you didn't leave,

52:02.100 --> 52:03.734
you didn't do anything.

52:06.300 --> 52:08.066
<i>I was this innocent, wide-eyed,</i>

52:08.166 --> 52:09.367
<i>naive Christian girl.</i>

52:09.467 --> 52:13.266
I was scared,

52:09.467 --> 52:13.266
but it definitely

52:13.367 --> 52:16.433
<i>made me the person</i>

52:13.367 --> 52:16.433
<i>that I am today.</i>

52:16.533 --> 52:20.567
I'm currently a volunteer

52:16.533 --> 52:20.567
firefighter in Vermont.

52:20.667 --> 52:24.333
<i>Being a firefighter,</i>

52:20.667 --> 52:24.333
<i>carrying 60 pounds of gear...</i>

52:24.433 --> 52:27.600
<i>going up flights of stairs,</i>

52:24.433 --> 52:27.600
<i>and, like, I have to be fit.</i>

52:29.367 --> 52:31.333

52:32.200 --> 52:33.467
[Dwayne]<i> Hey, Marianne?</i>

52:34.900 --> 52:36.567
I'm a huge fan

52:34.900 --> 52:36.567
of Dwayne Johnson.

52:36.667 --> 52:39.533
-[laughs]

52:36.667 --> 52:39.533
-[laughing]

52:39.633 --> 52:41.567
[shudders] So I...

52:42.467 --> 52:44.100
I still can't believe

52:42.467 --> 52:44.100
I did this.

52:44.200 --> 52:47.400
And I muted him.

52:44.200 --> 52:47.400
I put him on hold.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.867
Could you just--

52:47.500 --> 52:49.867
just hold on one second?

52:50.567 --> 52:52.533
<i>Holy crap! It's The Rock!</i>

52:52.633 --> 52:54.734
Oh, my God. I'm freaking out.

52:52.633 --> 52:54.734
I'm freaking out.

52:56.834 --> 52:59.233
She fainted.

52:56.834 --> 52:59.233
Guys, Marianne fainted.

52:59.333 --> 53:00.700
[chuckles]

53:02.500 --> 53:04.700
-Okay, I'm good, I'm good.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.700
<i>-Is this Marianne?</i>

53:04.800 --> 53:05.934
Yep, hey.

53:06.033 --> 53:08.433
Hey, Marianne, first of all

53:06.033 --> 53:08.433
I just want to say--

53:08.533 --> 53:11.567
I want to thank you

53:08.533 --> 53:11.567
for your service to our country.

53:11.667 --> 53:13.133
<i>You know, it speaks volumes,</i>

53:11.667 --> 53:13.133
<i>I think,</i>

53:13.233 --> 53:14.800
<i>of what you're gonna bring--</i>

53:14.900 --> 53:17.000
Holy crap.

53:17.100 --> 53:19.400
I want to welcome you

53:17.100 --> 53:19.400
to The Titan Games.

53:19.500 --> 53:22.266
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

53:22.367 --> 53:24.934
<i>Dwayne Johnson wants me to be</i>

53:22.367 --> 53:24.934
<i>on</i> The Titan Games,

53:25.033 --> 53:26.734
and I am the hungriest person

53:25.033 --> 53:26.734
in the room.

53:26.834 --> 53:28.166
I know I can be a Titan.

53:34.867 --> 53:35.967
[Liam]<i> Marianne's confident</i>

53:36.066 --> 53:38.033
<i>she's going to be</i>

53:36.066 --> 53:38.033
<i>our next Titan,</i>

53:38.133 --> 53:41.266
<i>but her opponent comes in</i>

53:38.133 --> 53:41.266
<i>with something to prove.</i>

53:42.734 --> 53:43.967
[Cari]<i> Most of our competitors</i>

53:44.066 --> 53:46.100
<i>were stars</i>

53:44.066 --> 53:46.100
<i>on their sports teams,</i>

53:46.200 --> 53:47.734
<i>but Nikkie Neal had to fight</i>

53:47.834 --> 53:50.700
<i>just to stand out</i>

53:47.834 --> 53:50.700
<i>in her own family.</i>

53:50.800 --> 53:52.533
<i>I'm the youngest</i>

53:50.800 --> 53:52.533
<i>of my five siblings,</i>

53:52.633 --> 53:54.734
<i>so there's always</i>

53:52.633 --> 53:54.734
<i>that competition like,</i>

53:54.834 --> 53:55.900
"You're my little sister.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.266
I'll always be better

53:56.000 --> 53:57.266
than you."

53:57.367 --> 53:59.300
<i>I feel like my whole life</i>

53:57.367 --> 53:59.300
<i>I was always living up</i>

53:59.400 --> 54:00.400
<i>to my sisters's standards,</i>

54:00.500 --> 54:01.800
<i>kind of like</i>

54:00.500 --> 54:01.800
<i>in their shadows.</i>

54:01.900 --> 54:04.433
-Are you tired?

54:01.900 --> 54:04.433
-Nah, I can keep going.

54:04.533 --> 54:05.734
-Okay.

54:04.533 --> 54:05.734
-[laughs]

54:05.834 --> 54:08.500
Until we kind of, like,

54:05.834 --> 54:08.500
went different routes in life.

54:09.567 --> 54:11.000
<i>I'm actually a fitness model.</i>

54:11.100 --> 54:12.800
<i>People that look at me,</i>

54:11.100 --> 54:12.800
<i>they'll think that,</i>

54:12.900 --> 54:14.233
<i>"Oh, she's just</i>

54:12.900 --> 54:14.233
<i>a pretty face."</i>

54:14.333 --> 54:17.200
<i>Most people would not</i>

54:14.333 --> 54:17.200
<i>expect me to do well,</i>

54:17.300 --> 54:20.000
but I surprise people usually.

54:20.100 --> 54:21.967
<i>They're like, "Oh, wait.</i>

54:20.100 --> 54:21.967
<i>She's actually strong.</i>

54:22.066 --> 54:24.066
<i>Oh, she's fast, too!"</i>

54:24.166 --> 54:26.867
<i>I work out every single day.</i>

54:24.166 --> 54:26.867
<i>I'll do boxing.</i>

54:26.967 --> 54:29.500
<i>I'll do kickboxing, cycling.</i>

54:29.600 --> 54:31.000
<i>People don't think</i>

54:29.600 --> 54:31.000
<i>that fitness models</i>

54:31.100 --> 54:32.433

54:32.533 --> 54:34.600
<i>I like to prove people wrong,</i>

54:32.533 --> 54:34.600
<i>and that's my reason</i>

54:34.700 --> 54:37.133
<i>to become stronger</i>

54:34.700 --> 54:37.133
<i>and become the next Titan.</i>

54:44.200 --> 54:45.767
[Liam]<i> Nikkie's family</i>

54:44.200 --> 54:45.767
<i>in the crowd tonight.</i>

54:45.867 --> 54:49.233
<i>Mom and big sister</i>

54:45.867 --> 54:49.233
<i>here to support her.</i>

54:49.333 --> 54:51.266
[Alex]<i> Now, L.A.</i>

54:49.333 --> 54:51.266
<i>is known for earthquakes,</i>

54:51.367 --> 54:52.433
but on<i> The Titan Games</i>

54:52.533 --> 54:54.233
you have to watch out

54:52.533 --> 54:54.233
for the Cyclone.

54:57.133 --> 55:00.467
<i>With this deranged test</i>

54:57.133 --> 55:00.467
<i>of core strength and stability,</i>

55:00.567 --> 55:02.000
<i>you'll need to whip around</i>

55:02.100 --> 55:05.433
<i>a suspended</i>

55:02.100 --> 55:05.433
<i>60-pound wrecking ball.</i>

55:05.533 --> 55:08.233
<i>The goal is to knock over</i>

55:05.533 --> 55:08.233
<i>all five pillars</i>

55:08.333 --> 55:10.867
<i>that are each nearly</i>

55:08.333 --> 55:10.867
<i>two stories tall.</i>

55:10.967 --> 55:13.266
[Liam]<i> The challenge</i>

55:10.967 --> 55:13.266
<i>is as the circumference</i>

55:13.367 --> 55:15.200
<i>of the ball's path increases,</i>

55:15.300 --> 55:19.500
<i>it will require even more</i>

55:15.300 --> 55:19.500
<i>strength to maintain control,</i>

55:19.600 --> 55:23.033
<i>but whoever can wreak</i>

55:19.600 --> 55:23.033
<i>the most havoc makes the cut</i>

55:23.133 --> 55:24.633
<i>for Mount Olympus.</i>

55:30.900 --> 55:33.800
I wanted my challenges

55:30.900 --> 55:33.800
to be an event,

55:33.900 --> 55:36.133
and this one does not disappoint

55:33.900 --> 55:36.133
with metal chains,

55:36.233 --> 55:38.533
giant pillars,

55:36.233 --> 55:38.533
and huge wrecking balls.

55:38.633 --> 55:40.700
It's intimidating,

55:38.633 --> 55:40.700
but that's why I made sure

55:40.800 --> 55:42.700
the people competing

55:40.800 --> 55:42.700
were fearless.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.467
Right now,

55:42.800 --> 55:44.467
two will enter the storm,

55:44.567 --> 55:46.667
but only one heads

55:44.567 --> 55:46.667
to Mount Olympus.

55:46.767 --> 55:48.934
Nikkie, Marianne,

55:46.767 --> 55:48.934
it's really simple.

55:49.033 --> 55:50.767
All I want is all you got.

55:50.867 --> 55:52.066
This is Cyclone.

56:00.567 --> 56:03.200
<i>and finding out</i>

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:28.767
<i>and you're headed</i>

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:28.767
<i>to Mount Olympus.</i>

1:03:34.333 --> 1:03:37.734
Sometimes life can feel like

1:03:34.333 --> 1:03:37.734
an uphill battle, which is why

1:03:37.834 --> 1:03:40.533
I designed this next challenge

1:03:37.834 --> 1:03:40.533
to represent that--

1:03:40.633 --> 1:03:42.867
both figuratively

1:03:40.633 --> 1:03:42.867
and literally--

1:03:42.967 --> 1:03:44.900
but a Titan has the strength

1:03:42.967 --> 1:03:44.900
to keep going

1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.233
even when that path is steep.

1:03:47.333 --> 1:03:49.133
So, Charity and Mariah,

1:03:49.233 --> 1:03:51.433
the path doesn't get

1:03:49.233 --> 1:03:51.433
much steeper than this,

1:03:51.533 --> 1:03:53.967
but the opportunity that awaits

1:03:51.533 --> 1:03:53.967
you on the other side

1:03:54.066 --> 1:03:55.400
makes it all worthwhile.

1:03:55.500 --> 1:03:57.066
This is Heavy Metal.

1:03:57.166 --> 1:03:58.767
[dramatic music]

1:04:02.166 --> 1:04:05.633
[Liam]<i> Charity Witt the blue,</i>

1:04:02.166 --> 1:04:05.633
<i>Mariah Counts in the red.</i>

1:04:05.734 --> 1:04:06.967
<i>30-foot ramp,</i>

1:04:07.066 --> 1:04:10.333
<i>and you're lifting</i>

1:04:07.066 --> 1:04:10.333
<i>more chain with each step.</i>

1:04:10.433 --> 1:04:14.400
<i>Every foot they move puts</i>

1:04:10.433 --> 1:04:14.400
<i>ten more pounds on their back.</i>

1:04:18.066 --> 1:04:20.633
[Alex]<i> Imagine carrying</i>

1:04:18.066 --> 1:04:20.633
<i>a refrigerator up a mountain</i>

1:04:20.734 --> 1:04:22.066
<i>and every step,</i>

1:04:22.166 --> 1:04:25.133
<i>someone throws a ten-pound</i>

1:04:22.166 --> 1:04:25.133
<i>weight on to make it harder.</i>

1:04:32.867 --> 1:04:34.200
Push through!

1:04:34.300 --> 1:04:36.533
[Dwayne] Let's go, ladies!

1:04:34.300 --> 1:04:36.533
Let's go. Let's go!

1:04:38.333 --> 1:04:39.867
[Liam]<i> You want know</i>

1:04:38.333 --> 1:04:39.867
<i>how hard this is?</i>

1:04:39.967 --> 1:04:43.367
<i>Charity Witt,</i>

1:04:39.967 --> 1:04:43.367
<i>world record holder in squat,</i>

1:04:43.467 --> 1:04:46.433
<i>dead lift,</i>

1:04:43.467 --> 1:04:46.433
<i>and it is baby steps.</i>

1:04:46.533 --> 1:04:49.667
<i>You think you're stable,</i>

1:04:46.533 --> 1:04:49.667
<i>but when you start to move,</i>

1:04:49.767 --> 1:04:51.033
<i>the weight increases,</i>

1:04:51.133 --> 1:04:53.333
<i>and suddenly</i>

1:04:51.133 --> 1:04:53.333
<i>you're off balance.</i>

1:04:53.433 --> 1:04:54.867
[Alex]<i> Oh, man,</i>

1:04:53.433 --> 1:04:54.867
<i>and then Mariah,</i>

1:04:54.967 --> 1:04:58.800
<i>she can squat 285 pounds.</i>

1:04:58.900 --> 1:05:01.233
<i>This woman is a monster.</i>

1:05:06.367 --> 1:05:07.500
But Charity Witt manages

1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:08.800
to make it all the way

1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:08.800
up to the top.

1:05:08.900 --> 1:05:11.400
Now she's got to place the bar

1:05:08.900 --> 1:05:11.400
into the crank

1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:13.633
and start cranking

1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:13.633
with her entire body.

1:05:13.734 --> 1:05:16.433
[Liam]<i> It's time to turn</i>

1:05:13.734 --> 1:05:16.433
<i>and burn for Charity Witt.</i>

1:05:16.533 --> 1:05:18.567
<i>They blasted their legs</i>

1:05:16.533 --> 1:05:18.567
<i>on the way up.</i>

1:05:18.667 --> 1:05:22.000
<i>Now it's all about</i>

1:05:18.667 --> 1:05:22.000
<i>the arms and back.</i>

1:05:22.100 --> 1:05:24.900
<i>Heavy Metal is</i>

1:05:22.100 --> 1:05:24.900
<i>a full-body beat-down.</i>

1:05:25.934 --> 1:05:26.934
[Alex]<i> And Mariah sees</i>

1:05:27.033 --> 1:05:28.367
<i>that Charity</i>

1:05:27.033 --> 1:05:28.367
<i>is already ahead of her.</i>

1:05:28.467 --> 1:05:30.066
Come on, babe! Let's go!

1:05:30.166 --> 1:05:32.066
<i>And with Daniella</i>

1:05:30.166 --> 1:05:32.066
<i>cheering her on,</i>

1:05:32.166 --> 1:05:33.734
<i>Mariah makes it to the top.</i>

1:05:34.166 --> 1:05:35.333
Good job.

1:05:35.433 --> 1:05:37.100
[Liam]<i> Charity has</i>

1:05:35.433 --> 1:05:37.100
<i>a head start here,</i>

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:39.000
<i>but Mariah's still in this.</i>

1:05:39.100 --> 1:05:40.600
<i>She knows every crank</i>

1:05:40.700 --> 1:05:43.834
<i>gets her one step closer</i>

1:05:40.700 --> 1:05:43.834
<i>to Mount Olympus.</i>

1:05:43.934 --> 1:05:45.834
[Alex]<i> You're not</i>

1:05:43.934 --> 1:05:45.834
<i>just winding the chain.</i>

1:05:45.934 --> 1:05:49.400
<i>Those blocks at the bottom</i>

1:05:45.934 --> 1:05:49.400
<i>weigh 100 pounds.</i>

1:05:51.467 --> 1:05:53.867
<i>And there you see</i>

1:05:51.467 --> 1:05:53.867
<i>Charity's concrete block</i>

1:05:53.967 --> 1:05:55.333
<i>starting to rise.</i>

1:05:55.433 --> 1:05:58.533
<i>Another 15 feet, and she's</i>

1:05:55.433 --> 1:05:58.533
<i>headed to Mount Olympus.</i>

1:05:58.633 --> 1:06:01.967
[Liam]<i> This is literal</i>

1:05:58.633 --> 1:06:01.967
<i>head-to-head competition.</i>

1:06:08.066 --> 1:06:10.800
[Alex]<i> And now Mariah finally</i>

1:06:08.066 --> 1:06:10.800
<i>gets her concrete block</i>

1:06:10.900 --> 1:06:13.700
<i>off the ground,</i>

1:06:10.900 --> 1:06:13.700
<i>but Charity is so close.</i>

1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:15.033
<i>Go!</i>

1:06:18.700 --> 1:06:20.367
<i>And she does it!</i>

1:06:22.066 --> 1:06:25.133
<i>Charity Witt is your winner.</i>

1:06:25.233 --> 1:06:27.500
[Liam]<i> Strength</i>

1:06:25.233 --> 1:06:27.500
<i>and then endurance</i>

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:30.533
<i>and the heart of a champion</i>

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:30.533
<i>with Charity Witt.</i>

1:06:30.633 --> 1:06:32.667
[Alex]<i> Charity used</i>

1:06:30.633 --> 1:06:32.667
<i>her powerful legs</i>

1:06:32.767 --> 1:06:34.467
<i>to charge to the top,</i>

1:06:34.567 --> 1:06:38.033
<i>then threw her whole body</i>

1:06:34.567 --> 1:06:38.033
<i>into the crank.</i>

1:06:38.133 --> 1:06:40.600
[Liam]<i> And her heart,</i>

1:06:38.133 --> 1:06:40.600
<i>once considered a weakness,</i>

1:06:40.700 --> 1:06:43.033
<i>proved to be</i>

1:06:40.700 --> 1:06:43.033
<i>her strongest weapon.</i>

1:06:45.433 --> 1:06:47.233
<i>So Charity Witt will face off</i>

1:06:47.333 --> 1:06:49.800
<i>with Nikkie Neal</i>

1:06:47.333 --> 1:06:49.800
<i>for the Titan crown.</i>

1:06:51.133 --> 1:06:53.867
Those crowned as Titans

1:06:51.133 --> 1:06:53.867
tonight can soak in the glory

1:06:53.967 --> 1:06:55.834
for a little while,

1:06:53.967 --> 1:06:55.834
but they'll all return

1:06:55.934 --> 1:06:57.934
here to compete

1:06:55.934 --> 1:06:57.934
against our other winners

1:06:58.033 --> 1:07:00.233
in the epic

1:06:58.033 --> 1:07:00.233
Battle of the Titans.

1:07:00.333 --> 1:07:05.300
One woman and one man

1:07:00.333 --> 1:07:05.300
will be crowned Titan Champions.

1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:09.100
Now two athletes who just took

1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:09.100
down their strong opponents

1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:11.100
face the mountain of madness.

1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:14.400
They've shown incredible courage

1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:14.400
in their lives just to get here,

1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:16.266
turning doubters into believers.

1:07:16.367 --> 1:07:20.033
It's Nikkie Neal versus

1:07:16.367 --> 1:07:20.033
the powerlifter, Charity Witt.

1:07:22.900 --> 1:07:25.233
<i>The edge I have over Nikkie</i>

1:07:22.900 --> 1:07:25.233
<i>is that I'm just strong.</i>

1:07:25.333 --> 1:07:27.767
<i>Like there is probably nothing</i>

1:07:25.333 --> 1:07:27.767
<i>in Mount Olympus</i>

1:07:27.867 --> 1:07:29.333
<i>that I couldn't overpower.</i>

1:07:29.433 --> 1:07:32.734
[Alex]<i> Charity Witt</i>

1:07:29.433 --> 1:07:32.734
<i>is your winner.</i>

1:07:33.467 --> 1:07:34.633
<i>Charity's a badass.</i>

1:07:34.734 --> 1:07:36.333
<i>She can dead lift,</i>

1:07:34.734 --> 1:07:36.333
<i>like, 500 pounds,</i>

1:07:36.433 --> 1:07:38.033
<i>and that's insane.</i>

1:07:36.433 --> 1:07:38.033
<i>Where I have an advantage</i>

1:07:38.133 --> 1:07:41.500
is I'm quicker

1:07:38.133 --> 1:07:41.500
and I'm more agile than she is.

1:07:42.934 --> 1:07:45.433
[Alex]<i> Nikkie Neal, unreal.</i>

1:07:46.066 --> 1:07:47.667
It's gonna be a battle.

1:07:52.600 --> 1:07:55.834
I am so impressed by these

1:07:52.600 --> 1:07:55.834
two unbelievably strong women.

1:07:55.934 --> 1:07:58.066
Nikkie, Charity,

1:07:58.166 --> 1:08:00.500
Mount Olympus doesn't care

1:07:58.166 --> 1:08:00.500
what gender you are.

1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:03.000
It'll use everything

1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:03.000
in its power to stop you,

1:08:03.100 --> 1:08:04.400
but you need to push past that

1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:06.433
and give it

1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:06.433
everything you've got.

1:08:06.533 --> 1:08:09.166
It's time to electrify

1:08:06.533 --> 1:08:09.166
the Titan Arena.

1:08:09.266 --> 1:08:11.133
This is Mount Olympus.

1:08:11.233 --> 1:08:12.767
[dramatic music]

1:08:16.700 --> 1:08:18.667
[Liam]<i> Nikkie in the red,</i>

1:08:16.700 --> 1:08:18.667
<i>Charity in the blue</i>

1:08:18.767 --> 1:08:21.834
<i>racing to</i>

1:08:18.767 --> 1:08:21.834
<i>the 1,000-pound wall.</i>

1:08:22.900 --> 1:08:24.600
[Alex]<i> There's that power.</i>

1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:27.000
<i>Upper-body strength</i>

1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:27.000
<i>from Charity Witt.</i>

1:08:27.100 --> 1:08:29.266
<i>That is gonna give her</i>

1:08:27.100 --> 1:08:29.266
<i>a little bit of a lead there.</i>

1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:34.500
[Liam]<i> But Nikkie Neal</i>

1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:34.500
<i>also takes it down.</i>

1:08:36.066 --> 1:08:38.300
Let's go, ladies!

1:08:36.066 --> 1:08:38.300
Let's go! Let's go!

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:40.467
Come on, Nik! Good job.

1:08:44.266 --> 1:08:45.600
[Alex]<i> And Charity</i>

1:08:44.266 --> 1:08:45.600
<i>just destroys</i>

1:08:45.700 --> 1:08:47.967
<i>the Gates of Mount Olympus.</i>

1:08:48.066 --> 1:08:50.200
[Liam]<i> But now her agility</i>

1:08:48.066 --> 1:08:50.200
<i>will be tested.</i>

1:08:51.900 --> 1:08:53.934
<i>And right away,</i>

1:08:51.900 --> 1:08:53.934
<i>she's struggling.</i>

1:08:54.033 --> 1:08:55.834
<i>You want to stay</i>

1:08:54.033 --> 1:08:55.834
<i>on top of those rollers</i>

1:08:55.934 --> 1:08:57.700
<i>and keep your feet moving.</i>

1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:59.834
[Alex]<i> This is where Nikkie</i>

1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:59.834
<i>needs to take the lead,</i>

1:08:59.934 --> 1:09:03.033
<i>but she's not faring</i>

1:08:59.934 --> 1:09:03.033
<i>much better than Charity.</i>

1:09:03.133 --> 1:09:05.734
<i>The rollers would be</i>

1:09:03.133 --> 1:09:05.734
<i>tough enough on level ground,</i>

1:09:05.834 --> 1:09:07.233
<i>but you're moving uphill.</i>

1:09:07.333 --> 1:09:09.467
<i>Gravity wants you</i>

1:09:07.333 --> 1:09:09.467
<i>rolling back.</i>

1:09:12.233 --> 1:09:15.500
[Liam]<i> And there goes Nikkie.</i>

1:09:12.233 --> 1:09:15.500
<i>Look at that footwork.</i>

1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:18.033
<i>She has the lead</i>

1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:18.033
<i>heading into The Cliffs.</i>

1:09:18.133 --> 1:09:20.834
There you go! There you go!

1:09:18.133 --> 1:09:20.834
There you go!

1:09:20.934 --> 1:09:22.834
[Liam]<i> First, she needs</i>

1:09:20.934 --> 1:09:22.834
<i>to punch and kick</i>

1:09:22.934 --> 1:09:23.834
<i>a road to the top.</i>

1:09:23.934 --> 1:09:25.300
<i>And Charity has caught up.</i>

1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:28.600
<i>She's here to prove</i>

1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:28.600
<i>there's no quit in Witt.</i>

1:09:28.700 --> 1:09:30.900
There you go.

1:09:28.700 --> 1:09:30.900
Punch that wall, ladies.

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.367
[Liam]<i> This is strategy</i>

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.367
<i>as much as it is toughness.</i>

1:09:34.467 --> 1:09:37.500
[Alex]<i> You have to have</i>

1:09:34.467 --> 1:09:37.500
<i>a plan on The Cliffs</i>

1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:40.633
<i>or else you could</i>

1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:40.633
<i>potentially fall off.</i>

1:09:40.734 --> 1:09:42.367
<i>Nikkie Neal needs to establish</i>

1:09:42.467 --> 1:09:44.200
<i>another hole</i>

1:09:42.467 --> 1:09:44.200
<i>so she can jump up.</i>

1:09:44.300 --> 1:09:46.266
<i>She uses her right leg</i>

1:09:44.300 --> 1:09:46.266
<i>to do that.</i>

1:09:47.767 --> 1:09:50.400
<i>But Charity makes it</i>

1:09:47.767 --> 1:09:50.400
<i>up The Cliffs first.</i>

1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:53.233
<i>She has a slight lead</i>

1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:53.233
<i>over Nikkie.</i>

1:09:53.333 --> 1:09:55.000
[Liam]<i> Now they're</i>

1:09:53.333 --> 1:09:55.000
<i>both on the torch.</i>

1:09:55.100 --> 1:09:56.200
<i>Charity into it.</i>

1:09:56.300 --> 1:09:58.567
<i>This should be</i>

1:09:56.300 --> 1:09:58.567
<i>a strength for her.</i>

1:10:00.233 --> 1:10:02.767
[Alex]<i> We know that</i>

1:10:00.233 --> 1:10:02.767
<i>the upper-body strength</i>

1:10:02.867 --> 1:10:05.767
<i>of Charity Witt was something</i>

1:10:02.867 --> 1:10:05.767
<i>that she was highlighting</i>

1:10:05.867 --> 1:10:08.000
<i>coming into The Titan Games.</i>

1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:11.633
<i>This is where you've got</i>

1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:11.633
<i>to put it all to use.</i>

1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:16.700
<i>This is now</i>

1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:16.700
<i>a neck-and-neck race.</i>

1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:19.233
<i>Who is gonna go down</i>

1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:19.233
<i>Mount Olympus first?</i>

1:10:20.934 --> 1:10:22.700
<i>Absolutely mind-blowing.</i>

1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:25.467
<i>The fitness model</i>

1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:25.467
<i>is outcranking the powerlifter.</i>

1:10:26.967 --> 1:10:29.667
Nikkie Neal, despite Charity

1:10:26.967 --> 1:10:29.667
having the upper-body strength,

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:31.867
she manages

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:31.867
to raise the torch first!

1:10:31.967 --> 1:10:33.633
Go! Go! Go!

1:10:33.734 --> 1:10:35.367
[Liam]<i> Nikkie Neal</i>

1:10:33.734 --> 1:10:35.367
<i>back in the lead.</i>

1:10:35.467 --> 1:10:37.734
Wow, let's go!

1:10:35.467 --> 1:10:37.734
Get down to me!

1:10:37.834 --> 1:10:41.233
[Liam]<i> A shocking turn,</i>

1:10:37.834 --> 1:10:41.233
<i>and she's headed down first.</i>

1:10:42.967 --> 1:10:44.934
[Alex]<i> They're separated</i>

1:10:42.967 --> 1:10:44.934
<i>by only a few feet</i>

1:10:45.033 --> 1:10:47.000
<i>as they descend</i>

1:10:45.033 --> 1:10:47.000
<i>down the mountain.</i>

1:10:47.533 --> 1:10:49.834
This is awesome.

1:10:51.934 --> 1:10:54.834
<i>And look at Charity.</i>

1:10:51.934 --> 1:10:54.834
<i>She looks exhausted,</i>

1:10:54.934 --> 1:10:57.500
<i>hanging her head as she</i>

1:10:54.934 --> 1:10:57.500
<i>slides down the mountain,</i>

1:10:57.600 --> 1:10:59.467
<i>but she continues to fight.</i>

1:11:00.166 --> 1:11:02.133
<i>Mount Olympus is not a sprint.</i>

1:11:02.233 --> 1:11:04.200
<i>It's one mean marathon.</i>

1:11:04.300 --> 1:11:06.367
Come on!

1:11:04.300 --> 1:11:06.367
You can do it! Let's go!

1:11:06.467 --> 1:11:09.166
[Liam]<i> They're both</i>

1:11:06.467 --> 1:11:09.166
<i>at that third and final wall</i>

1:11:09.266 --> 1:11:10.834
<i>heading to the floor.</i>

1:11:12.567 --> 1:11:14.667
<i>Nikkie Neal</i>

1:11:12.567 --> 1:11:14.667
<i>the first one there,</i>

1:11:14.767 --> 1:11:17.000
<i>and again,</i>

1:11:14.767 --> 1:11:17.000
<i>strength beats strategy.</i>

1:11:17.100 --> 1:11:18.800
[Alex]<i> She's got to start</i>

1:11:17.100 --> 1:11:18.800
<i>pulling now.</i>

1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:20.834
<i>You know that the upper-body</i>

1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:20.834
<i>strength of Charity Witt</i>

1:11:20.934 --> 1:11:23.300
<i>is going to shine</i>

1:11:20.934 --> 1:11:23.300
<i>on the Ball and Chain,</i>

1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:25.800
<i>and Charity Witt</i>

1:11:23.400 --> 1:11:25.800
<i>just has to get a handle on it.</i>

1:11:25.900 --> 1:11:28.633
<i>And look at that!</i>

1:11:25.900 --> 1:11:28.633
<i>Just one arm!</i>

1:11:28.734 --> 1:11:30.967
<i>Just one arm</i>

1:11:28.734 --> 1:11:30.967
<i>was all she needed!</i>

1:11:31.066 --> 1:11:33.133
<i>Nikkie had that lead,</i>

1:11:31.066 --> 1:11:33.133
<i>and she got down</i>

1:11:33.233 --> 1:11:35.400
<i>Mount Olympus first,</i>

1:11:33.233 --> 1:11:35.400
<i>but it doesn't matter</i>

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:37.800
<i>that you were faster</i>

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:37.800
<i>down the mountain.</i>

1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:40.166
All that matters is that

1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:40.166
you're pulling that boulder

1:11:40.266 --> 1:11:41.400
with everything you got.

1:11:41.500 --> 1:11:43.667
[Nikkie] Ahh! Come on, Nikkie.

1:11:43.767 --> 1:11:44.734
[groans]

1:11:44.834 --> 1:11:47.033
[Liam]<i> Listen to</i>

1:11:44.834 --> 1:11:47.033
<i>that determination,</i>

1:11:47.133 --> 1:11:50.033
<i>Nikkie willing herself</i>

1:11:47.133 --> 1:11:50.033
<i>to that Titan tomb.</i>

1:11:50.133 --> 1:11:51.467
Come on. Come on!

1:11:51.567 --> 1:11:53.700
[Liam]<i> She's come</i>

1:11:51.567 --> 1:11:53.700
<i>too far to quit now.</i>

1:11:56.367 --> 1:11:58.300
[Alex]<i> Charity does look</i>

1:11:56.367 --> 1:11:58.300
<i>a little gassed,</i>

1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:00.867
<i>but Nikkie Neal</i>

1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:00.867
<i>has to hurry up.</i>

1:12:00.967 --> 1:12:02.100
Come on, Nikkie.

1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:04.300
<i>Can Charity manage</i>

1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:04.300
<i>to make a hole big enough</i>

1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:07.567
<i>so that she can claw</i>

1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:07.567
<i>through it with her bare hands</i>

1:12:07.667 --> 1:12:10.734
<i>and get out that relic</i>

1:12:07.667 --> 1:12:10.734
<i>from the Titan tomb?</i>

1:12:12.734 --> 1:12:15.000
<i>But Nikkie Neal now,</i>

1:12:12.734 --> 1:12:15.000
<i>does she have it in her?</i>

1:12:15.100 --> 1:12:16.233
<i>Does she have the energy</i>

1:12:16.333 --> 1:12:17.867
<i>to break through the cement</i>

1:12:16.333 --> 1:12:17.867
<i>quickly enough?</i>

1:12:17.967 --> 1:12:21.200
[Liam]<i> Can Nikkie Neal</i>

1:12:17.967 --> 1:12:21.200
<i>make one last push here?</i>

1:12:23.433 --> 1:12:26.834
[Alex]<i> You have to just dig</i>

1:12:23.433 --> 1:12:26.834
<i>as deep as you possibly can.</i>

1:12:26.934 --> 1:12:30.166
<i>The title of Titan</i>

1:12:26.934 --> 1:12:30.166
<i>is right in front of you,</i>

1:12:30.266 --> 1:12:33.367
<i>but Charity Witt,</i>

1:12:30.266 --> 1:12:33.367
<i>she has the relic in her hands,</i>

1:12:33.467 --> 1:12:35.600
<i>and she's gonna</i>

1:12:33.467 --> 1:12:35.600
<i>run up the steps.</i>

1:12:37.266 --> 1:12:40.333
<i>Charity Witt,</i>

1:12:37.266 --> 1:12:40.333
<i>the powerlifter...</i>

1:12:41.133 --> 1:12:43.266
<i>she is a Titan.</i>

[inspirational music]

1:12:47.066 --> 1:12:49.667
[cheering]

1:12:49.767 --> 1:12:52.200
Let me get that off for you.

1:12:52.300 --> 1:12:54.900
Congratulations. You did it.

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.233
Great job. Great job.

1:12:57.667 --> 1:12:58.967
Good job.

1:12:59.066 --> 1:13:01.967
Girl, I thought you had it.

1:12:59.066 --> 1:13:01.967
I thought you had it.

1:13:02.066 --> 1:13:03.600
Good job. You did good.

1:13:05.633 --> 1:13:06.667
[Alex]<i> What a race.</i>

1:13:06.767 --> 1:13:08.934
<i>Charity's power</i>

1:13:06.767 --> 1:13:08.934
<i>put her ahead early,</i>

1:13:09.033 --> 1:13:10.967
<i>but Nikkie used her long legs</i>

1:13:11.066 --> 1:13:14.266
<i>and surprising upper-body</i>

1:13:11.066 --> 1:13:14.266
<i>strength to blow past her</i>

1:13:14.367 --> 1:13:16.266
<i>and beat Charity</i>

1:13:14.367 --> 1:13:16.266
<i>to the arena floor.</i>

1:13:16.367 --> 1:13:17.700
[Liam]<i> But then you got</i>

1:13:16.367 --> 1:13:17.700
<i>to the Ball and Chain,</i>

1:13:17.800 --> 1:13:19.500
<i>and that's</i>

1:13:17.800 --> 1:13:19.500
<i>where it all changed.</i>

1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:20.934
[Alex]<i> One arm!</i>

1:13:21.033 --> 1:13:24.200
<i>Just an incredible display</i>

1:13:21.033 --> 1:13:24.200
<i>of power in Charity Witt,</i>

1:13:24.300 --> 1:13:27.266
<i>the powerlifter who battled</i>

1:13:24.300 --> 1:13:27.266
<i>through a heart condition.</i>

1:13:27.367 --> 1:13:29.033
<i>Tonight, she's a Titan.</i>

1:13:29.133 --> 1:13:31.333
[Liam]<i> And she's</i>

1:13:29.133 --> 1:13:31.333
<i>standing by with Cari.</i>

1:13:31.433 --> 1:13:33.934
Charity, anything you want

1:13:31.433 --> 1:13:33.934
to say to folks at home?

1:13:34.033 --> 1:13:37.967
Yeah. I mean, I was told that

1:13:34.033 --> 1:13:37.967
I needed to be on medication,

1:13:38.066 --> 1:13:39.400
have open-heart surgery,

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:42.934
and I didn't listen to them,

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:42.934
and I kept fighting.

1:13:43.033 --> 1:13:46.300
Just like Mount Olympus,

1:13:43.033 --> 1:13:46.300
fought through that.

1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:48.600
So the message

1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:48.600
to all of you guys,

1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:51.934
just listen to your own heart,

1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:51.934
and keep fighting.

1:13:54.967 --> 1:13:56.800
Here you go.

1:13:54.967 --> 1:13:56.800
You have earned this.

1:13:56.900 --> 1:13:58.600
Congratulations. You're a Titan.

1:13:58.700 --> 1:13:59.567
Thank you so much.

1:13:59.667 --> 1:14:01.066
That was

1:13:59.667 --> 1:14:01.066
an amazing performance.

1:14:01.166 --> 1:14:02.533
-Thank you.

1:14:01.166 --> 1:14:02.533
-I'm so proud of you.

1:14:02.633 --> 1:14:05.033
We are gonna be crowning

1:14:02.633 --> 1:14:05.033
another Titan right after this.

1:14:05.133 --> 1:14:06.600
Stay with us. Amazing.

1:14:10.433 --> 1:14:13.400
[dramatic music]

1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:16.400
[Alex]<i> Welcome back</i>

1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:16.400
<i>to the spectacular Titan Arena.</i>

1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:19.200
<i>It's time</i>

1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:19.200
<i>for our thrilling final battle.</i>

1:14:19.300 --> 1:14:21.467
<i>Bring it, DJ.</i>

1:14:21.567 --> 1:14:24.133
Now we've got two competitors

1:14:21.567 --> 1:14:24.133
who are chomping at the bit

1:14:24.233 --> 1:14:27.000
to take down the mountain

1:14:24.233 --> 1:14:27.000
and become a Titan.

1:14:27.100 --> 1:14:30.500
Both of these competitors

1:14:27.100 --> 1:14:30.500
are ambitious, aggressive,

1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:32.266
and defy expectations.

1:14:32.367 --> 1:14:36.233
It's Quinn Rivera

1:14:32.367 --> 1:14:36.233
versus Cole Wadsworth.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.100
<i>My edge over Quinn</i>

1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:41.800
<i>is probably</i>

1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:41.800
<i>just the fact that I train,</i>

1:14:41.900 --> 1:14:45.100
<i>specifically functional type</i>

1:14:41.900 --> 1:14:45.100
<i>training, balance, agility,</i>

1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:47.133
but there's just things

1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:47.133
that you can't replicate

1:14:47.233 --> 1:14:49.633
<i>when you're inside of a gym.</i>

1:14:49.734 --> 1:14:52.100
<i>On the farm, I spend</i>

1:14:49.734 --> 1:14:52.100
<i>a lot of time throwing hay</i>

1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:55.000
<i>or swinging a sledgehammer,</i>

1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:55.000
<i>just all the physical work</i>

1:14:55.100 --> 1:14:56.600
that keeps you

1:14:55.100 --> 1:14:56.600
in such great shape.

1:14:56.700 --> 1:14:58.266
Got to stay focused

1:14:56.700 --> 1:14:58.266
and win this thing.

1:14:58.367 --> 1:15:00.233
-Well, you're going to.

1:14:58.367 --> 1:15:00.233
<i>-My wife is amazing.</i>

1:15:00.333 --> 1:15:01.967
<i>When we're</i>

1:15:00.333 --> 1:15:01.967
<i>working out together,</i>

1:15:02.066 --> 1:15:03.600
<i>we're always just pushing</i>

1:15:02.066 --> 1:15:03.600
<i>each other</i>

1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:04.967
to kind of hit that next limit,

1:15:05.066 --> 1:15:07.333
<i>which is why we're both</i>

1:15:05.066 --> 1:15:07.333
<i>so competitive.</i>

1:15:09.400 --> 1:15:12.033
I have two beautiful daughters,

1:15:09.400 --> 1:15:12.033
Giselle who's five

<i>and Veda, who is</i>

1:15:12.133 --> 1:15:14.700
<i>almost a year old now.</i>

1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:17.166
My daddy's a superhero.

<i>I want to compete</i>

1:15:17.266 --> 1:15:19.100

<i>for my family</i>

1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:21.133
<i>and also for myself.</i>

1:15:21.233 --> 1:15:23.433
<i>I want to take</i>

1:15:21.233 --> 1:15:23.433
<i>this amazing opportunity</i>

1:15:23.533 --> 1:15:25.166
<i>and prove to people</i>

1:15:23.533 --> 1:15:25.166
<i>that to become a Titan,</i>

1:15:25.266 --> 1:15:26.934
<i>you have to be farmer strong.</i>

1:15:28.266 --> 1:15:29.800
<i>One of the things that</i>

1:15:28.266 --> 1:15:29.800
<i>I really will lean on</i>

1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:31.133
<i>is my athletic background</i>

1:15:31.233 --> 1:15:33.233
and my ability to really

1:15:31.233 --> 1:15:33.233
push through the hurt.

1:15:40.633 --> 1:15:42.100

1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:47.700
You can feel the electricity

1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:47.700
in Titan Arena.

1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:49.734
The crowd is ready.

1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:49.734
These two men

1:15:49.834 --> 1:15:52.867
are tremendous athletes

1:15:49.834 --> 1:15:52.867
with incredible agility.

1:15:52.967 --> 1:15:56.100
They're both small-town guys

1:15:52.967 --> 1:15:56.100
who made a very big impact

1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:57.567
in this competition so far.

1:15:57.667 --> 1:16:00.900
Quinn, Cole,

1:15:57.667 --> 1:16:00.900
you only get one shot at this,

1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.967
so lay it all out on the line,

1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.967
and grit it out.

1:16:05.066 --> 1:16:06.200
This is Mount Olympus.

1:16:06.300 --> 1:16:07.967
[dramatic music]

1:16:12.367 --> 1:16:13.433
[Liam]<i> Quinn in the red,</i>

1:16:13.533 --> 1:16:15.066
<i>Cole in the blue,</i>

1:16:13.533 --> 1:16:15.066
<i>and they're off.</i>

1:16:15.166 --> 1:16:16.734
[Alex]<i> Looking forward</i>

1:16:15.166 --> 1:16:16.734
<i>to seeing how these two men</i>

1:16:16.834 --> 1:16:19.200
<i>are gonna tackle</i>

1:16:16.834 --> 1:16:19.200
<i>the 1,000-pound wa--</i>

1:16:19.300 --> 1:16:20.633
<i>Never mind.</i>

1:16:19.300 --> 1:16:20.633
<i>I should have just stopped</i>

1:16:20.734 --> 1:16:22.066
<i>talking at that moment</i>

1:16:20.734 --> 1:16:22.066
<i>there, Liam,</i>

1:16:22.166 --> 1:16:23.734
<i>because they're flying</i>

1:16:22.166 --> 1:16:23.734
<i>right through this.</i>

1:16:24.867 --> 1:16:28.734
[Liam]<i> Look at that power,</i>

1:16:24.867 --> 1:16:28.734
<i>driving 450 pounds uphill.</i>

1:16:30.633 --> 1:16:33.200
[Alex]<i> The Gates of Olympus</i>

1:16:30.633 --> 1:16:33.200
<i>are no challenge</i>

1:16:33.300 --> 1:16:35.633
<i>for them as well?</i>

1:16:33.300 --> 1:16:35.633
<i>What is going on here?!</i>

1:16:37.934 --> 1:16:40.900
<i>Quinn Rivera is flying through</i>

1:16:37.934 --> 1:16:40.900
<i>the rolling assent.</i>

1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:42.533
<i>Cole Wadsworth is right there.</i>

1:16:44.433 --> 1:16:45.500
Oh, my goodness, Liam!

1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:48.500
<i>They are flying up</i>

1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:48.500
<i>Mount Olympus!</i>

1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:50.967
Wow, look at this. Go!

1:17:01.767 --> 1:17:04.867
Come on. Let's go, boys!

1:17:01.767 --> 1:17:04.867
Get up that wall.

1:17:04.967 --> 1:17:07.200
[Alex]<i> And Cole's using</i>

1:17:04.967 --> 1:17:07.200
<i>his upper-body strength</i>

1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:10.166
<i>to get up The Cliffs,</i>

1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:10.166
<i>and he takes the first lead.</i>

1:17:10.266 --> 1:17:11.767
<i>Oh! He takes a spill.</i>

1:17:11.867 --> 1:17:13.400
<i>Quickly, though,</i>

1:17:11.867 --> 1:17:13.400
<i>back on his feet,</i>

1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:16.233
<i>and Quinn reaches the top</i>

1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:16.233
<i>right behind him.</i>

1:17:16.333 --> 1:17:18.734
[Liam]<i> And these two men</i>

1:17:16.333 --> 1:17:18.734
<i>are neck and neck,</i>

1:17:18.834 --> 1:17:20.934
<i>as they race</i>

1:17:18.834 --> 1:17:20.934
<i>to raise their torches.</i>

1:17:23.100 --> 1:17:25.567
-Go, Daddy! Go!

1:17:23.100 --> 1:17:25.567
-Dad!

1:17:26.066 --> 1:17:27.800
[dramatic music]

1:17:30.166 --> 1:17:32.333
[Alex]<i> Those torches</i>

1:17:30.166 --> 1:17:32.333
<i>are 600 pounds.</i>

1:17:32.433 --> 1:17:34.800
<i>It's like reeling in</i>

1:17:32.433 --> 1:17:34.800
<i>a full-grown grizzly bear.</i>

1:17:34.900 --> 1:17:36.500
<i>And here comes Quinn.</i>

1:17:39.667 --> 1:17:43.100
<i>They both raise the torch</i>

1:17:39.667 --> 1:17:43.100
<i>at the same time.</i>

1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:45.667
Get down to me, boys. Yes!

1:17:46.367 --> 1:17:48.734
<i>What is going on here, Liam?</i>

1:17:48.834 --> 1:17:51.633
<i>They are just flying.</i>

1:17:52.633 --> 1:17:54.734
<i>They are just tumbling over</i>

1:17:52.633 --> 1:17:54.734
<i>Mount Olympus.</i>

1:17:54.834 --> 1:17:56.867
-[Liam]<i> Head over heels.</i>

1:17:54.834 --> 1:17:56.867
<i>-It's like an avalanche</i>

1:17:56.967 --> 1:18:00.633
<i>going down,</i>

1:17:56.967 --> 1:18:00.633
<i>and they are amazing!</i>

1:18:00.734 --> 1:18:03.633
Come on, Quinn!

1:18:00.734 --> 1:18:03.633
Come on, Q!

1:18:04.934 --> 1:18:08.166
[Liam]<i> Now, both men are</i>

1:18:04.934 --> 1:18:08.166
<i>at the Ball and Chain.</i>

1:18:09.033 --> 1:18:10.367
<i>Get a good grip,</i>

1:18:09.033 --> 1:18:10.367
<i>and get going,</i>

1:18:10.467 --> 1:18:12.133
<i>and that's what</i>

1:18:10.467 --> 1:18:12.133
<i>Quinn's doing.</i>

1:18:17.233 --> 1:18:18.266
Let's go, boys!

1:18:19.333 --> 1:18:23.000
[Alex]<i> It has been</i>

1:18:19.333 --> 1:18:23.000
<i>a close, close race here.</i>

1:18:23.100 --> 1:18:24.600
<i>Quinn reaches the tomb first,</i>

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:28.200
<i>but his hammer,</i>

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:28.200
<i>his hammer doesn't reach.</i>

1:18:28.300 --> 1:18:31.100
<i>Cole Wadsworth,</i>

1:18:28.300 --> 1:18:31.100
<i>he's gonna he hacking first.</i>

1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:32.367
<i>Quinn Rivera</i>

1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:32.367
<i>has to hurry up.</i>

1:18:32.467 --> 1:18:33.934
[Liam]<i> He's got to start</i>

1:18:32.467 --> 1:18:33.934
<i>hammering away.</i>

1:18:34.033 --> 1:18:35.500
[Alex]<i> He just</i>

1:18:34.033 --> 1:18:35.500
<i>didn't have enough--</i>

1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:37.033
<i>enough stretch on that chain.</i>

1:18:37.133 --> 1:18:38.967
Come on, Quinn! Get going!

1:18:39.066 --> 1:18:40.734
[Liam]<i> Cole still looking</i>

1:18:39.066 --> 1:18:40.734
<i>for the relic,</i>

1:18:40.834 --> 1:18:43.200
<i>and Quinn is desperately</i>

1:18:40.834 --> 1:18:43.200
<i>trying to break through,</i>

1:18:43.300 --> 1:18:44.567
<i>and he's in.</i>

1:18:45.967 --> 1:18:48.333
[Alex]<i> Who will find</i>

1:18:45.967 --> 1:18:48.333
<i>the relic first?</i>

1:18:52.533 --> 1:18:54.567
<i>Cole Wadsworth,</i>

1:18:52.533 --> 1:18:54.567
<i>he's grabbed it.</i>

1:18:54.667 --> 1:18:55.834
<i>He's grabbed the relic!</i>

1:18:55.934 --> 1:18:58.967
<i>From Draper, Utah,</i>

1:18:55.934 --> 1:18:58.967
<i>Cole Wadsworth</i>

1:18:59.066 --> 1:19:02.800
<i>is putting them on the map,</i>

1:18:59.066 --> 1:19:02.800
<i>'cause he's a Titan.</i>

1:19:02.900 --> 1:19:06.533
<i>-Farm strong, Titan strong.</i>

1:19:02.900 --> 1:19:06.533
-[Alex]<i> Wow.</i>

1:19:07.033 --> 1:19:09.200
[triumphant music]

Yes!

1:19:27.500 --> 1:19:29.000
Good freakin' job, man.

Good job, brother.

1:19:33.333 --> 1:19:36.367
[Liam]<i> That was</i>

1:19:33.333 --> 1:19:36.367
<i>a hair-on-fire sprint.</i>

1:19:36.467 --> 1:19:39.467
[Alex]<i> You couldn't have</i>
