00:15.003 --> 00:16.870
Please stop.

00:18.206 --> 00:21.341
Oh, oh...

00:26.415 --> 00:30.347
It stops when you tell me
what I need to know.

00:31.319 --> 00:32.952
No...

00:34.523 --> 00:36.145
Where is he?

00:37.159 --> 00:38.836
Where is he?!

00:38.860 --> 00:42.039
I don't know. Please, please.

00:42.063 --> 00:43.986
Please.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.780
This is all a mistake.

00:47.302 --> 00:51.704
I didn't have anything to do
with that man's death.

00:55.143 --> 00:57.188
You really didn't do it, did you?

00:57.212 --> 01:01.850
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah?

01:01.874 --> 01:03.840
I promise. I swear.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.328
Please, please.

01:05.352 --> 01:07.384
I can't do that.

01:08.056 --> 01:09.033
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:09.057 --> 01:10.201
No, no, no, no!

01:22.170 --> 01:24.582
This is not the kind of stuff
we want hitting the streets.

01:24.606 --> 01:27.552
The person we're looking for
had access to...

01:38.854 --> 01:40.253
Need some help?

01:41.256 --> 01:43.057
Hey, yeah, I'm looking for the SAC.

01:43.081 --> 01:44.545
Isobel Castille.

01:45.460 --> 01:48.535
- Hi, uh, I'm Hailey.
- Detective Upton.

01:48.559 --> 01:50.107
I've heard a lot
of good things about you.

01:50.131 --> 01:52.176
I'm Special Agent in Charge
Isobel Castille.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.111
We just caught a pretty gruesome murder,

01:54.135 --> 01:55.513
so you might as well
hit the ground running.

01:55.537 --> 01:56.881
Sounds good to me.

01:56.905 --> 01:59.016
You will be partnered with Agent Zidan.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.518
- Hi, I'm OA.
- Hi.

02:00.542 --> 02:01.719
- Hailey.
- Nice to meet you.

02:01.743 --> 02:02.753
You too.

02:02.777 --> 02:04.322
Listen up, everyone.

02:04.346 --> 02:07.191
This is Detective Hailey Upton
from Chicago PD.

02:07.215 --> 02:08.860
She will be with us
for the next few weeks

02:08.883 --> 02:10.828
as part of our interagency
training program.

02:10.852 --> 02:11.896
All right, so let's, uh,

02:11.920 --> 02:13.764
direct our attention to the screens here.

02:13.788 --> 02:17.435
Found the body of a young John
Doe in St. Nicholas Park.

02:17.459 --> 02:19.437
A hundred yards from
Alexander Hamilton's house.

02:19.461 --> 02:21.308
Federal land, federal case... and no,

02:21.333 --> 02:23.297
it is not where Aaron Burr shot him.

02:23.321 --> 02:25.710
The famed duel took place in...
anyone, anyone?

02:25.734 --> 02:27.979
Weehawken, New Jersey. Kristen knew.

02:28.003 --> 02:31.449
Unfortunately, there's far less
clarity in the present homicide case.

02:31.473 --> 02:33.551
Evidence of torture and abuse,

02:33.575 --> 02:34.886
the victim was brown-skinned,

02:34.910 --> 02:36.387
but there was no other evidence
of a hate crime.

02:36.411 --> 02:38.623
So let's dig in, get to work,
start filling in the blanks.

02:38.647 --> 02:40.346
Yeah? Go.

02:41.917 --> 02:43.349
- You ready?
- Yeah.

02:46.454 --> 02:48.933
So, Chicago PD? Should I be nervous?

02:48.957 --> 02:50.301
Nervous?

02:50.325 --> 02:51.903
You guys have been in the news a lot

02:51.927 --> 02:53.532
and not for good reasons.

02:53.962 --> 02:56.240
Uh, yeah, we've had some issues,

02:56.264 --> 02:57.596
but they're being addressed.

02:57.620 --> 02:59.844
It's a great place.
I'm proud to be a part of it.

02:59.868 --> 03:01.579
Listen, in the future,
if you want to insult me,

03:01.603 --> 03:02.947
you can just go ahead and do it.

03:02.971 --> 03:04.782
You don't have to disguise
the putdown with humor.

03:04.806 --> 03:06.150
Which car? This one?

03:06.174 --> 03:08.452
Yeah, sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

03:08.476 --> 03:10.555
I guess that's just my way of saying

03:10.579 --> 03:11.923
we do things different here.

03:11.947 --> 03:12.979
Mm.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.649
Just trying to keep it real.

03:18.053 --> 03:20.164
So you spend much time in New York?

03:20.188 --> 03:21.768
Nah, first time here.

03:22.290 --> 03:23.834
Any early observations?

03:23.858 --> 03:25.336
Pizza's too thin.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.139
It's like a cracker with sauce on it.

03:28.163 --> 03:29.696
Just trying to keep it real.

03:38.006 --> 03:39.072
Yo!

03:40.475 --> 03:42.119
You two taking the handle on this?

03:42.143 --> 03:43.187
Yes, sir.

03:43.211 --> 03:44.689
I'm Agent Zidan, this is Detective Upton.

03:45.172 --> 03:47.005
Can you bring us up to speed?

03:48.383 --> 03:50.227
Jogger called it in.

03:50.251 --> 03:52.663
No blood pooled on the ground.
No shell casings.

03:52.687 --> 03:55.900
So it looked like the guy was
killed at another location

03:55.924 --> 03:57.234
and dropped off here.

03:57.258 --> 03:59.003
Did the jogger see
the body being dropped?

03:59.027 --> 04:01.672
If she did, I would've said so.

04:01.696 --> 04:03.341
It's a New York thing.

04:03.365 --> 04:05.509
It felt like a cop versus fed thing.

04:05.533 --> 04:07.178
What's that supposed to mean?

04:07.202 --> 04:08.946
You think you're better than us.

04:15.910 --> 04:18.322
- No phone, no wallet?
- No nothing.

04:18.346 --> 04:20.690
Don't even know
what the kid's ethnicity is.

04:20.714 --> 04:23.060
Could be Hispanic, Middle Eastern...

04:23.084 --> 04:26.041
His face is so torn up,
I can't tell which.

04:26.621 --> 04:28.732
That's a Kada, so he's probably Indian.

04:28.757 --> 04:30.257
Sikh.

04:34.362 --> 04:35.873
Could still be a hate crime, though.

04:35.897 --> 04:37.174
Most of the people around here

04:37.198 --> 04:39.065
don't really care
which shade of brown you are.

04:41.503 --> 04:45.583
We have a university bookstore
receipt dated yesterday.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.104
Thanks.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.225
Got a hit on facial rec.

04:54.249 --> 04:56.027
Victim's name is Aman Patel.

04:56.051 --> 04:57.531
25. Indian national.

04:58.148 --> 04:59.930
All right, notify the Indian Consulate

04:59.954 --> 05:01.465
so they can make
the appropriate notifications.

05:01.489 --> 05:04.035
He's a registered student
at Paul Revere University,

05:04.059 --> 05:06.203
Yes, here on an F-1 student visa.

05:06.227 --> 05:07.938
Before that,
he graduated top of his class

05:07.962 --> 05:09.407
out of a university in India.

05:09.431 --> 05:11.676
Then he came here to pursue
a masters in engineering.

05:11.700 --> 05:14.512
Any priors or run-ins
with the campus cops?

05:14.536 --> 05:17.167
No, looks like he was
too busy getting a 4.0 GPA.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.341
Right.

05:18.365 --> 05:20.084
M.E. just confirmed that he was tortured.

05:20.108 --> 05:21.752
Nails were torn off one by one,

05:21.776 --> 05:24.321
fingers pulled back
and individually broken.

05:24.345 --> 05:26.057
Kay, so someone wanted Aman to suffer

05:26.081 --> 05:28.392
or needed answers.
The question is, which one?

05:28.416 --> 05:30.061
- Do we have a home address?
- Not yet.

05:30.085 --> 05:32.063
We do have a PO box
over at the university.

05:32.087 --> 05:33.786
All right, head over there
and see what you can learn.

05:40.161 --> 05:43.496
He was a great kid.
Every professor's dream.

05:45.266 --> 05:48.079
Did Aman ever mention any issues?

05:48.103 --> 05:51.437
Threats, fears, anything
out of the ordinary?

05:53.441 --> 05:55.547
I'm not sure if this is related, but...

05:56.311 --> 05:58.122
something happened a few days ago.

05:58.146 --> 06:00.791
He was being harassed walking to class.

06:00.815 --> 06:02.793
Some racist guy was taunting him.

06:02.817 --> 06:04.428
Calling him a terrorist.

06:04.452 --> 06:06.297
Mm-kay. One last thing:

06:06.321 --> 06:08.299
Do you have any idea
where Aman was living?

06:08.323 --> 06:12.169
No, but I know he walked to school.

06:12.193 --> 06:14.672
And he didn't like his roommate.

06:14.696 --> 06:16.640
Said he partied too much.

06:16.664 --> 06:18.576
Can you think of anything else?

06:18.600 --> 06:21.011
No, sorry.

06:21.035 --> 06:22.869
It's okay. Thank you.

06:24.572 --> 06:27.885
Actually, there's
a laundromat near the house.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.720
Aman thought it was
the greatest thing ever.

06:29.744 --> 06:31.708
Clean clothes for 20 bucks a week.

06:32.147 --> 06:34.191
I get it. This is New York.

06:34.215 --> 06:36.546
There are dry cleaners on every block.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.819
I'm just trying to tell you what I know.

06:43.158 --> 06:46.604
The home address he used
to secure the PO box

06:46.628 --> 06:47.838
was from Albany.

06:47.862 --> 06:49.940
Apparently, he has an uncle
who lives there.

06:49.964 --> 06:51.175
But he wasn't living there.

06:51.199 --> 06:52.943
You can't walk to campus from Albany.

06:52.967 --> 06:54.745
I'm sorry, that's the only
address I've got.

06:54.769 --> 06:56.147
Anything else?

06:56.171 --> 06:59.383
Yes, uh, Professor Banks said
Aman was on the wrong end

06:59.407 --> 07:00.985
of some racial taunting recently.

07:01.009 --> 07:02.319
Did he file a report?

07:02.343 --> 07:04.889
Yes, the man's name is Frank Prichard,

07:04.913 --> 07:06.390
comes around here about once a week,

07:06.414 --> 07:08.159
always spewing racial nonsense.

07:08.491 --> 07:10.394
Campus security ever detain him?

07:10.418 --> 07:12.158
Yep. Several times.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.555
Okay, I'll need to see
those reports right away.

07:20.495 --> 07:21.800
Free country.

07:22.564 --> 07:24.530
I got a right to speak my mind.

07:25.709 --> 07:27.593
Is this how you speak your mind?

07:27.617 --> 07:29.446
What? No.

07:29.470 --> 07:32.349
Oh, no, I don't kill people.
I'm a patriot!

07:32.373 --> 07:35.019
I'm just... I'm trying to keep
the neighborhood safe.

07:35.043 --> 07:36.353
Safe from what?

07:36.377 --> 07:38.088
Arabs.

07:39.347 --> 07:41.826
- Excuse me.
- Not the good ones, like you.

07:41.850 --> 07:44.361
I'm talking about the ones with bombs.

07:46.287 --> 07:48.827
I'm just doing what
the government wants me to do.

07:49.661 --> 07:51.602
"See something, say something," huh?

07:51.626 --> 07:54.291
No. See something, do something.

07:54.963 --> 07:58.420
See, I get pictures of the ones
I think are suspicious.

08:08.676 --> 08:10.788
You see this guy, Frank?

08:10.812 --> 08:13.224
He's an Indian. Not an Arab.

08:13.248 --> 08:15.226
It's kind of the same thing, right?

08:15.250 --> 08:16.810
Before he died,

08:16.834 --> 08:18.596
he told his professor
that you were harassing him,

08:18.620 --> 08:20.531
calling him all sorts of colorful names.

08:20.974 --> 08:22.840
It's possible.

08:28.062 --> 08:29.640
Gonna need an alibi, Frank.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.664
Where were you last night?

08:33.101 --> 08:34.667
New York Hospital.

08:36.703 --> 08:38.293
Had a gallstone.

08:39.092 --> 08:41.126
Just got out this morning.

08:42.876 --> 08:44.977
Gonna need copies of those photos too.

08:46.639 --> 08:47.972
Now.

08:49.450 --> 08:51.962
I had a thumb drive.

08:54.022 --> 08:55.385
Here.

08:56.190 --> 08:57.935
Saves me a stamp.

08:57.959 --> 09:00.226
Was gonna mail them
to Homeland Security anyway.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.612
If I hear you're harassing
any more immigrants,

09:08.636 --> 09:11.815
I'm gonna come back here,
and I'm gonna break your arm.

09:16.477 --> 09:18.856
Do you understand?

09:18.880 --> 09:20.420
Yeah.

09:20.949 --> 09:22.381
Good.

09:29.157 --> 09:31.402
I forwarded Kristen the pictures of Aman.

09:31.426 --> 09:33.022
She'll get us a street block number

09:33.046 --> 09:35.205
based on the license plates
in the background.

09:35.229 --> 09:37.474
- Just like that, huh?
- The FBI, Upton.

09:37.498 --> 09:39.771
Our tech resources are pretty sick.

09:40.668 --> 09:41.745
Look, it's not a big deal,

09:41.769 --> 09:42.880
but now that you're working with us,

09:42.904 --> 09:44.315
just try and be a little bit
more careful.

09:44.339 --> 09:45.716
If that guy Prichard calls the Bureau

09:45.740 --> 09:47.217
complaining that you
threatened to use force...

09:47.241 --> 09:48.385
Look, man, I don't need a lesson

09:48.409 --> 09:49.887
on how to talk to people, all right?

09:49.911 --> 09:51.299
Hey, hey, hey.

09:52.380 --> 09:53.592
Don't get me wrong.

09:53.616 --> 09:55.359
I have no problem with someone
breaking that idiot's arm,

09:55.383 --> 09:56.413
it's just...

09:57.352 --> 09:59.196
It's just that the Bureau is hardcore,

09:59.220 --> 10:01.220
and they take that stuff
really seriously.

10:04.421 --> 10:05.569
You're right.

10:05.593 --> 10:07.204
I'm sorry.

10:07.228 --> 10:09.306
If he files a beef, I'll eat it
and make sure you're clear.

10:09.330 --> 10:11.230
- All right?
- Appreciate that.

10:13.067 --> 10:14.556
But what the hell's a beef?

10:15.235 --> 10:17.142
- It's an expression.
- I'm kidding.

10:19.839 --> 10:22.540
Kristen said Aman's house
is around this area.

10:26.381 --> 10:28.737
Emily said there's
a laundromat at the corner.

10:29.684 --> 10:31.584
Okay, there's one right there.

10:33.654 --> 10:36.655
And the house has a blue door.

10:38.091 --> 10:39.086
Blue door.

10:40.094 --> 10:41.092
All right.

10:43.323 --> 10:44.480
Door's open.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.273
FBI! Anybody home?

10:57.845 --> 11:00.146
- I'll go up.
- Copy.

11:04.385 --> 11:05.951
Living room's clear.

11:07.455 --> 11:09.655
Nice place for a college student.

11:35.316 --> 11:37.016
OA!

11:47.862 --> 11:49.829
Place has been tossed.

11:54.469 --> 11:56.180
Must be Aman's room.

11:56.762 --> 11:59.505
There's another bedroom.
Emily mentioned a roommate.

12:18.893 --> 12:20.270
Okay.

12:20.294 --> 12:22.039
Based on the clothes and the photos,

12:22.063 --> 12:24.708
Aman's roommate is around
30 years old, male,

12:24.732 --> 12:26.398
and likes to party.

12:28.703 --> 12:30.047
All of this searching

12:30.071 --> 12:32.182
has to be connected
to the murder somehow.

12:32.663 --> 12:34.885
Like the killer didn't get
what he wanted from Aman,

12:34.909 --> 12:37.855
so he came back here
and started searching.

12:37.879 --> 12:39.223
Question is, for what?

12:39.247 --> 12:41.225
Gun!

12:48.623 --> 12:50.156
Drop your weapon now!

12:51.759 --> 12:53.492
He's bailing out the back! I'm on him!

12:54.875 --> 12:56.975
Shots fired, in foot pursuit.
Requesting backup.

13:04.138 --> 13:05.435
On your six!

13:15.016 --> 13:16.660
Stop!

13:16.684 --> 13:19.029
Get out of the way!

13:25.560 --> 13:27.037
Where is he?

13:27.061 --> 13:28.872
I lost him.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.009
Responding units, be advised,

13:32.033 --> 13:33.944
the suspect was last seen running south,

13:33.968 --> 13:35.412
- described as male...
- Damn it.

13:35.436 --> 13:37.347
Hispanic, early 40s, black jacket.

13:37.371 --> 13:39.082
By the way, thank you.

13:39.106 --> 13:41.251
Huh? For what?

13:41.275 --> 13:45.289
For saving my ass back there.
In the house.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.057
Oh.

13:47.081 --> 13:48.659
Okay.

13:48.683 --> 13:50.649
Cool. You're welcome.

13:56.219 --> 13:58.742
Kelly, you guys start working
on the surveillance video.

13:58.767 --> 13:59.844
Pull camera footage from every camera

13:59.868 --> 14:01.346
within a mile radius of that house.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.281
I want a name and face
of the upstanding citizen

14:03.305 --> 14:05.350
that just opened up on OA
and Upton, yeah?

14:05.374 --> 14:06.884
- Jubal?
- Yep.

14:06.908 --> 14:09.253
I just spoke to the owner of
the house Aman was living in,

14:09.277 --> 14:11.222
he signed a lease with someone
named Lucas Reed

14:11.246 --> 14:12.223
seven months ago.

14:12.247 --> 14:13.825
Nice. Throw it up.

14:13.849 --> 14:16.828
Check it out, we have the name
of Aman's roommate, Lucas Reed.

14:16.852 --> 14:18.096
23, unemployed,

14:18.120 --> 14:20.365
did three semesters
at the University of Miami.

14:20.389 --> 14:23.101
He's got one misdemeanor prior
for marijuana possession.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.369
The question is,

14:24.393 --> 14:26.404
what is his relationship
with our murder victim?

14:26.428 --> 14:28.906
Are they just roomies,
or is there something else going on here?

14:28.930 --> 14:31.009
You guys grab a scuba tank.
Do a deep dive.

14:31.033 --> 14:32.510
Don't come up for air
until you got something.

14:32.534 --> 14:33.878
Uh, canvassed the area,

14:33.902 --> 14:35.046
talked to a lot of the neighbors.

14:35.070 --> 14:36.681
Sounds like this Lucas Reed guy's

14:36.705 --> 14:38.516
one flashy man about town.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.251
Threw a lot of parties,
played loud music...

14:40.275 --> 14:41.786
- Yeah.
- So the neighbors loved him.

14:41.810 --> 14:43.656
- Exactly.
- Anybody seen him recently?

14:43.680 --> 14:45.757
A woman named Denise Walters
saw him take off

14:45.781 --> 14:47.792
yesterday afternoon
in a silver Range Rover.

14:47.816 --> 14:49.794
Right... oh, oh, uh, ping Reed's phone,

14:49.818 --> 14:50.995
see if we can get a location.

14:51.019 --> 14:52.330
Yeah, I've been trying to do just that.

14:52.354 --> 14:54.132
I haven't found a phone
registered to him as of yet.

14:54.156 --> 14:56.048
Uh-huh, well, let's put out a BOLO

14:56.072 --> 14:57.445
on this silver Range Rover.

14:57.469 --> 14:58.803
Sooner we talk to this guy, the better.

14:58.827 --> 15:00.338
Just got ballistics back

15:00.362 --> 15:02.507
on the slugs fired at OA and Upton.

15:02.531 --> 15:05.109
They match the bullets that
killed Aman, but get this:

15:05.133 --> 15:06.511
They also match the bullets

15:06.535 --> 15:08.980
pulled from a drive by
murder victim two months ago.

15:09.004 --> 15:10.248
Could they ID a suspect yet?

15:10.272 --> 15:12.150
Yeah, arrested him too.

15:12.174 --> 15:15.153
Name is Santiago Gonzalez,

15:15.177 --> 15:16.988
known associate of the Latin Players.

15:17.012 --> 15:19.424
He's being held at MDC pending trial.

15:19.448 --> 15:21.426
Latin Players. That's a Chicago gang.

15:21.450 --> 15:23.461
Hmm, looks like they're expanding.

15:23.485 --> 15:27.098
So the Latin Players killed
someone, they get arrested,

15:27.122 --> 15:29.967
go to jail, and the gun
stays on the street.

15:29.991 --> 15:32.437
And the new owner uses
said gun to kill Aman,

15:32.461 --> 15:34.839
a studious Indian engineering student?

15:34.863 --> 15:36.841
Right. What are we missing?

15:36.865 --> 15:38.643
How are these two murders connected?

15:38.921 --> 15:41.612
Have OA and Upton pay a visit
to Inmate Gonzalez.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.448
Maybe he can help us answer
that question.

15:43.472 --> 15:44.537
Right.

15:48.143 --> 15:50.488
So this guy, Gonzalez,
is originally from Chicago.

15:50.512 --> 15:51.723
Runs with the Latin Players,

15:51.747 --> 15:53.524
so maybe you should take
the lead on this one.

15:53.548 --> 15:54.792
But go hard on him.

15:54.816 --> 15:56.394
- You want a reaction?
- A big one.

15:56.418 --> 15:58.396
Big enough to force him
to call his people.

15:58.420 --> 15:59.997
I think I can do that.

16:10.536 --> 16:12.677
Where's the gun you used in the drive-by?

16:12.914 --> 16:14.512
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:14.536 --> 16:16.948
One of your friends used it
to kill a civilian last night.

16:16.972 --> 16:18.516
Used it again this afternoon on us.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.151
Fired off ten rounds.

16:20.175 --> 16:22.220
Like I said, I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:22.244 --> 16:24.689
You're staring 20 to life
on the case you're riding.

16:24.713 --> 16:27.859
Give us the name of the person
you gave the gun to,

16:27.883 --> 16:30.161
and maybe I'll be able
to get you a reduced sentence.

16:30.185 --> 16:32.396
Get my ass, blondie.

16:37.726 --> 16:41.139
I'm not a fed like him.
I'm Chicago police.

16:41.163 --> 16:42.306
So what?

16:42.330 --> 16:44.175
Means I play by different rules.

16:44.199 --> 16:45.910
Also means I know the names

16:45.934 --> 16:48.246
of all the shot callers
in the Latin Players.

16:48.270 --> 16:50.748
Tomorrow morning,
we're gonna do a warrant sweep.

16:50.772 --> 16:53.618
Means a lot of people you know
are gonna get arrested.

16:53.642 --> 16:56.053
- That's not my problem.
- But it is.

16:56.077 --> 16:58.790
Because I'm gonna make sure
that they know

16:58.814 --> 17:01.025
you are the snitch who gave them up.

17:05.053 --> 17:07.231
Now, you know
nobody's gonna believe that.

17:07.255 --> 17:10.300
Really? Because in my experience,

17:10.325 --> 17:12.369
pissed-off bangers
don't do their homework,

17:12.394 --> 17:15.339
and if they think you're
a snitch, you're a snitch.

17:15.363 --> 17:18.798
In the street,
rumors become facts like that.

17:20.734 --> 17:22.063
I'm done talking.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.241
All right.

17:36.952 --> 17:38.796
So you think he believed us?

17:38.820 --> 17:41.294
I don't know. What?

17:41.923 --> 17:43.634
Nothing, you just reminded me
of my partner, Maggie,

17:43.658 --> 17:45.203
- in there.
- Oh.

17:45.227 --> 17:46.904
How are you, sir?

17:46.928 --> 17:48.426
In a good way.

17:49.297 --> 17:50.741
Then thank you.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.298
Can you cue up the audio feed?

17:55.047 --> 17:56.514
So where is your partner?

17:56.538 --> 17:59.283
Uh, she is on an undercover assignment.

17:59.307 --> 18:00.785
That I know absolutely nothing about

18:00.809 --> 18:03.243
besides the fact that
she is gone and unreachable.

18:04.679 --> 18:05.990
That's gotta be pretty tough.

18:06.014 --> 18:08.659
Yeah, but she's really good,

18:08.683 --> 18:10.865
so she'll be fine.

18:11.987 --> 18:13.164
We're up.

18:13.188 --> 18:15.633
Yo, just say the word, man.

18:15.657 --> 18:17.168
Chicago about to throw that heat.

18:17.192 --> 18:18.803
What are you talking about?

18:18.827 --> 18:21.072
Police and FBI here sweating me, man.

18:21.096 --> 18:22.607
About what?

18:22.631 --> 18:24.775
That piece that I left behind.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.677
I'm guess it's all connected
to what happened

18:26.701 --> 18:29.513
on the night at Highbridge Park.

18:29.537 --> 18:30.848
All right, thanks for looking out.

18:30.872 --> 18:32.405
No doubt.

18:33.536 --> 18:35.614
Can you trace the number that he called?

18:36.111 --> 18:38.089
Pay phone up in Washington Heights.

18:38.113 --> 18:39.746
Okay. Thank you.

18:42.217 --> 18:43.761
Any idea what we're looking for?

18:43.785 --> 18:44.962
Not really.

18:44.986 --> 18:46.464
All we know is something happened here

18:46.488 --> 18:49.400
three nights ago that might
be linked to Aman's murder.

18:52.193 --> 18:54.071
Okay, let's look for video cameras.

18:54.095 --> 18:55.806
Canvass for witnesses.

19:08.343 --> 19:10.554
Excuse me.

19:10.578 --> 19:12.590
Do you walk through here often?

19:12.614 --> 19:15.826
Uh, yeah. I live close by.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.412
Were you here three nights ago?

19:17.436 --> 19:20.031
I don't think so. I'm not really sure.

19:20.055 --> 19:22.066
Do you remember seeing anything unusual?

19:22.090 --> 19:24.335
People arguing? Gunshots?

19:24.359 --> 19:27.471
No. Sorry.

19:27.495 --> 19:29.794
- Can I go now?
- Yeah.

19:37.339 --> 19:39.050
Hey!

19:39.074 --> 19:41.574
Got a glove for whatever that's worth.

19:43.945 --> 19:45.222
Runner!

19:45.246 --> 19:47.003
Hey!

19:47.782 --> 19:49.927
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Slow down, amigo.

19:49.951 --> 19:52.263
- Don't shoot!
- Relax, we're not gonna shoot.

19:52.287 --> 19:54.065
Just take a deep breath.

19:54.089 --> 19:55.252
Why you running?

19:55.276 --> 19:57.134
Because I just saw that guy,

19:57.158 --> 19:59.190
and I didn't want to get blamed for it.

19:59.214 --> 20:00.577
Blamed for what?

20:00.601 --> 20:03.441
- The dead body.
- What dead body?

20:03.465 --> 20:05.576
Over there.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.211
I just wanted to see it, I swear.

20:07.235 --> 20:08.980
I've never seen a dead guy before.

20:09.004 --> 20:11.637
Just watch him.

20:17.145 --> 20:19.379
Hey, guys!

20:22.984 --> 20:25.229
I'm guessing this is what
happened in Highbridge Park

20:25.253 --> 20:26.419
a few nights ago.

20:29.999 --> 20:31.565
So the kid heard
there was a body in the park

20:31.590 --> 20:33.332
and wanted to see it.
He know anything else?

20:33.356 --> 20:35.491
No, he overheard some kids
in the park talking about it.

20:35.516 --> 20:36.727
Doesn't even know their names.

20:36.751 --> 20:38.128
He has an alibi
for the time of death too,

20:38.152 --> 20:39.763
so we released him to his parents.

20:39.787 --> 20:41.432
What else do we know about the dead guy?

20:41.456 --> 20:43.133
Well, Ernesto Garcia,

20:43.157 --> 20:44.601
known member of the Latin Players,

20:44.625 --> 20:47.004
three priors,
all narcotics-related, right?

20:47.028 --> 20:48.214
Anything else?

20:48.238 --> 20:50.207
Word in Chicago is he's the
number two here in New York.

20:50.231 --> 20:52.231
- All right.
- So how's his death connected

20:52.256 --> 20:53.439
to the engineering students?

20:53.463 --> 20:55.512
- No idea.
- But it is connected.

20:55.536 --> 20:57.214
We heard Santiago talking to his buddies,

20:57.238 --> 20:59.116
saying that it's related
to something that went down

20:59.140 --> 21:02.186
in Highbridge Park,
which we now know is Ernesto.

21:02.210 --> 21:03.379
Hey, guys.

21:03.403 --> 21:04.910
Here's the footage we recovered
from the park.

21:04.935 --> 21:07.483
- Great.
- Camera angle's about 20 yards east

21:07.507 --> 21:09.941
of the location of Ernesto's body.

21:16.383 --> 21:18.194
That's Lucas Reed, Aman's roommate,

21:18.218 --> 21:19.395
walking away from the body.

21:19.419 --> 21:20.830
He's only wearing one glove too.

21:22.222 --> 21:25.501
Okay, so, Lucas kills Ernesto,

21:25.525 --> 21:27.470
takes the backpack full of product,

21:27.494 --> 21:28.971
and goes into hiding.

21:28.995 --> 21:30.740
The Latin Players find out
what happened, go after Lucas,

21:30.764 --> 21:32.342
but take Aman instead.

21:32.366 --> 21:35.712
And they beat and torture him
hoping to get intel on Lucas.

21:35.736 --> 21:37.213
Makes perfect sense.

21:37.237 --> 21:39.148
The problem is,
we don't have enough evidence.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.551
There is no video, no prints, no DNA,

21:41.575 --> 21:43.720
nothing connecting
anyone to Aman's murder.

21:44.245 --> 21:46.885
Which is why we need to find Lucas Reed.

21:46.909 --> 21:48.156
He is the missing link.

21:48.180 --> 21:49.859
We arrest him for killing Ernesto

21:49.883 --> 21:51.494
and then leverage his
ass to take down the banger

21:51.518 --> 21:53.696
responsible for torturing
and killing Aman.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.098
I don't know where Lucas is,

21:55.122 --> 21:57.856
but I found some recent photos
off of his social media.

22:00.227 --> 22:01.804
I'm guessing that's his girlfriend.

22:02.929 --> 22:04.874
Hold on. I talked to her at the park,

22:04.898 --> 22:07.143
right before we found Ernesto's body.

22:07.167 --> 22:09.979
Ah, and we have a hit off of social rec.

22:10.003 --> 22:12.749
Her name is Harper Quinlan, 23 years old,

22:12.773 --> 22:16.719
last known address is 84 Groton
Street, Queens, New York.

22:16.743 --> 22:18.209
Go.

22:21.479 --> 22:23.092
She hasn't lived here for a while.

22:23.492 --> 22:24.861
About two years.

22:25.244 --> 22:26.929
Do you know a guy named Lucas Reed?

22:27.425 --> 22:29.031
No, never heard of him. Why?

22:29.290 --> 22:31.067
When was the last time
you talked to your daughter?

22:31.472 --> 22:34.170
Hold on. What's this all about?

22:34.561 --> 22:35.972
We believe that your daughter's boyfriend

22:35.996 --> 22:37.695
might be involved in a murder.

22:39.332 --> 22:40.543
Oh.

22:50.811 --> 22:53.823
I haven't talked to Harper
in five or six months.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.733
She just...

22:57.117 --> 22:58.428
We lost touch.

22:58.777 --> 23:01.364
She dropped out of college,
started partying...

23:01.388 --> 23:02.765
What about her friends?

23:02.789 --> 23:05.301
Stopped talking to them too. It's like...

23:05.325 --> 23:06.803
it's like she just cut herself off

23:06.827 --> 23:08.871
from everybody she knew and loved.

23:09.371 --> 23:12.008
You said that her boyfriend
might be involved.

23:12.032 --> 23:14.110
What about Harper?
She's not part of this, is she?

23:14.134 --> 23:16.034
We don't know. We're still investigating.

23:18.472 --> 23:20.483
You know where she's living now?

23:20.507 --> 23:22.318
Some crappy apartment over in Brooklyn.

23:22.342 --> 23:25.321
I, uh, followed her one day
to this building in Red Hook.

23:25.345 --> 23:27.812
- But you didn't talk to her.
- I tried to.

23:29.316 --> 23:33.151
She... she asked me to leave.

23:37.224 --> 23:40.670
Uh, if she happens
to reach out, give us a call.

23:40.694 --> 23:43.172
I will. The odds ain't great.

23:43.489 --> 23:44.855
Trust me.

23:45.732 --> 23:47.699
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:50.036 --> 23:51.614
OA and Upton got an address
for the girlfriend.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.682
They're headed there now.

23:52.706 --> 23:54.225
- Kristen.
- Yeah?

23:54.249 --> 23:56.118
Forwarded you some new video
from Highbridge Park,

23:56.142 --> 23:57.753
different angles, wider coverage.

23:57.777 --> 24:00.990
Uh, 5:54 p.m., that's the
timestamp on the last video

24:01.014 --> 24:03.326
when we saw Lucas leaving the
murder scene with the backpack.

24:03.350 --> 24:04.894
Okay. All right, got something.

24:04.918 --> 24:06.050
Check this out.

24:07.587 --> 24:09.198
That's Lucas' Range Rover,

24:09.222 --> 24:11.033
but he got into the passenger's side.

24:11.057 --> 24:13.014
Zoom in. Who's driving?

24:18.398 --> 24:20.910
Son of a bitch.

24:20.934 --> 24:23.913
OA, you're no longer
going over to the apartment

24:23.937 --> 24:25.181
to talk to Harper.

24:25.205 --> 24:27.450
You're going over there to arrest her.

24:30.277 --> 24:33.723
- Why were you at the park?
- I told you before.

24:33.747 --> 24:35.091
I was walking.

24:35.115 --> 24:37.026
Or was it to recover
the glove that Lucas dropped

24:37.050 --> 24:38.788
after he killed his drug supplier?

24:38.812 --> 24:40.763
I don't know anything about that.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.669
We have video of you in the driver's seat

24:46.693 --> 24:49.372
of Lucas' Range Rover at Highbridge Park

24:49.396 --> 24:52.008
the night that Lucas killed
Ernesto Garcia,

24:52.032 --> 24:53.743
so you are now an official suspect

24:53.767 --> 24:55.344
in a murder investigation.

24:55.368 --> 24:56.846
That means no more lying,

24:56.870 --> 24:58.447
no more protecting your boyfriend.

24:58.471 --> 25:01.083
You either cooperate with us
here and now,

25:01.525 --> 25:02.585
or you go to prison.

25:02.609 --> 25:04.954
I'm not gonna help you ruin Lucas' life.

25:05.449 --> 25:07.790
I just won't. He's a good person.

25:08.115 --> 25:11.661
Harper, good people don't
sell drugs or kill people.

25:11.685 --> 25:13.396
Yeah, you don't know him like I do.

25:14.038 --> 25:15.956
He's so nice, and...

25:16.656 --> 25:19.502
- he's sweet...
- In love.

25:19.526 --> 25:21.237
More like dumb love.

25:21.261 --> 25:22.772
What's the difference?

25:22.796 --> 25:24.273
He really loves me.

25:24.297 --> 25:27.276
Lucas isn't who you think he is, Harper.

25:27.718 --> 25:31.280
Protecting him will only get you

25:31.304 --> 25:32.748
and more innocent people hurt.

25:32.772 --> 25:36.419
Tell me why you think he was
in the park that night.

25:36.443 --> 25:39.155
I'm not gonna help you.

25:39.179 --> 25:41.924
Are you listening
to what I'm saying to you?

25:41.948 --> 25:45.428
You're a suspect in a murder
investigation here.

25:49.689 --> 25:51.567
Lying to protect him makes this worse.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.002
You're putting more lives at risk.

25:53.026 --> 25:54.503
Be smart.

25:54.527 --> 25:56.772
Tell me why you were there that night.

25:56.796 --> 25:59.450
Harper, you don't need
to go to prison for him.

26:01.368 --> 26:03.145
Unlock it.

26:03.169 --> 26:04.547
What's going on?

26:04.571 --> 26:05.848
Do it.

26:05.872 --> 26:08.184
Pull up your texts.

26:14.514 --> 26:16.359
Oh, my God.

26:16.383 --> 26:18.294
What does it say?

26:18.318 --> 26:20.496
"Return the product, or he's dead.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.398
"You have four hours.

26:22.422 --> 26:23.899
"Tell your man to meet us at the place

26:23.923 --> 26:25.835
we did our first deal."

26:27.761 --> 26:30.797
Oh, my... oh, my God.

26:32.338 --> 26:34.828
Kay, Tom Quinlan, father
of Lucas Reed's girlfriend,

26:34.853 --> 26:37.052
has been abducted by the Latin Players.

26:37.076 --> 26:39.567
His home address is 84 Groton Street.

26:39.591 --> 26:41.603
His work address is 29 Parsons Boulevard.

26:41.627 --> 26:43.756
Let's get boots on the ground
in both neighborhoods,

26:43.780 --> 26:46.508
canvass for witnesses,
pull traffic PODS, surveillance cams.

26:46.532 --> 26:47.842
- Hey, Jubal?
- Yeah?

26:47.866 --> 26:49.210
We ran Tom's phone.

26:49.234 --> 26:50.612
It was shut off three seconds
after the text was sent,

26:50.636 --> 26:52.013
but it pinged a tower
in Washington Heights.

26:52.037 --> 26:54.415
Good, good, good. There's
another neighborhood to dig into.

26:54.439 --> 26:56.684
Washington Heights.
Same deal: Witnesses, video.

26:56.708 --> 26:58.713
Emily, you wanna grab Scola
and head down there?

26:58.737 --> 27:01.345
We're on a clock, people!
We got four hours.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.324
Correction, three hours and 49 minutes.

27:03.348 --> 27:04.592
Let's get moving.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.112
Harper's our best play.

27:07.136 --> 27:09.629
We get her to cooperate, we got a chance.

27:09.654 --> 27:11.699
Well, I agree, but so far
she's been a brick wall.

27:11.723 --> 27:12.867
Mm.

27:14.893 --> 27:16.037
Let me take a run at her.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.179
I might have an angle to play.

27:36.982 --> 27:38.893
You're in a tough place
right now, Harper.

27:39.433 --> 27:41.729
We have video of you
at the scene of a murder,

27:42.019 --> 27:43.998
which makes you an accessory.

27:44.022 --> 27:46.289
You're looking
at 15 to 20 years in prison.

27:51.445 --> 27:54.976
But if you cooperate, we can help you.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.179
We'll talk to the prosecutor,
explain why you were there,

27:58.660 --> 28:02.249
help him understand the nature
of your relationship with Lucas.

28:02.273 --> 28:04.085
What are you talking about?

28:04.109 --> 28:06.253
I know what's going on.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.310
He hurts you, doesn't he?

28:09.581 --> 28:11.314
No. That's not true.

28:12.784 --> 28:14.528
- He's a good guy...
- No, he's not.

28:14.771 --> 28:16.338
What are those bruises on your neck?

28:17.515 --> 28:19.148
You tried to cover them up,
but I can see them.

28:22.627 --> 28:25.270
When you first met, I bet he was great.

28:25.897 --> 28:28.409
You guys hit it off, you had fun.

28:28.433 --> 28:30.442
He was everything you wanted.

28:31.302 --> 28:33.614
But then he started chipping
away at your friends

28:34.031 --> 28:35.742
and your family.

28:36.031 --> 28:38.586
So you pop a pill to numb the pain

28:38.610 --> 28:40.688
and tell yourself everything's okay,

28:40.713 --> 28:43.814
just hoping that the abuse is gonna stop.

28:46.618 --> 28:48.210
Harper.

28:49.087 --> 28:50.420
It won't.

28:57.662 --> 28:59.328
I talked to your dad.

29:02.801 --> 29:04.812
He loves you very much.

29:06.371 --> 29:08.416
And he needs you right now.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.484
He's in a lot of danger.

29:10.508 --> 29:12.586
If these guys don't get their drugs back,

29:12.610 --> 29:14.236
they will kill him.

29:15.113 --> 29:19.193
The only thing that matters now
is you helping us to find Lucas,

29:19.217 --> 29:22.018
so we can recover the drugs
and find your dad.

29:47.184 --> 29:49.651
So how do you know so much about abuse?

29:52.316 --> 29:54.829
I am sorry, I did not mean
anything by that.

29:54.853 --> 29:56.497
No, it's fine. It's all good.

29:56.521 --> 29:58.299
Everyone becomes a cop for a reason.

29:58.496 --> 30:00.029
I guess that's mine.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.702
Uh, yeah.

30:10.935 --> 30:12.246
Don't forget, Harper.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.814
He wants the cash to get out of town,

30:13.838 --> 30:16.350
but we need the location
where he first met his dealer.

30:16.374 --> 30:18.133
That's where your dad is.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.602
Got eyes on Lucas.

30:34.626 --> 30:36.670
Just got out of the Range Rover.

30:36.694 --> 30:38.661
Here we go.

30:44.502 --> 30:45.968
- Sup, baby.
- Hey.

30:47.672 --> 30:50.740
- How much you get?
- 2,400.

30:52.377 --> 30:54.711
Nice work. Nice work.

30:55.446 --> 30:57.113
I really appreciate it.

30:59.017 --> 31:00.494
Babe.

31:00.518 --> 31:02.663
They took my father.

31:02.687 --> 31:04.064
What are you talking about?

31:04.088 --> 31:05.766
That guy that you deal with,
they grabbed my father

31:05.790 --> 31:07.334
and texted me that they're gonna kill him

31:07.358 --> 31:08.936
unless we return the drugs that you took.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.371
Oh, no, no.

31:10.395 --> 31:12.139
I can't... I can't do that.

31:12.163 --> 31:14.141
They took my father!

31:14.165 --> 31:17.778
Look, I feel bad, but they will kill me.

31:17.802 --> 31:19.880
- Oh, Jesus, don't...
- Lucas.

31:19.904 --> 31:21.415
Don't give me the sad eyes look.

31:21.439 --> 31:22.483
Lucas.

31:22.507 --> 31:24.118
I'm screwed.

31:24.142 --> 31:27.488
Look, I gotta look out for me...
for us, you understand?

31:27.512 --> 31:28.989
Look, I need to know
where you and Ernesto

31:29.013 --> 31:30.090
did your first deal

31:30.114 --> 31:32.059
'cause that's where they wanna meet.

31:32.083 --> 31:33.294
I just told you, I'm not going...

31:33.318 --> 31:34.929
I will go!

31:34.953 --> 31:36.664
I'll call my uncle.
He has a lot of money.

31:36.688 --> 31:39.172
Maybe I can negotiate
a deal or something.

31:40.358 --> 31:42.770
I gotta get moving, all
right, so give me the money.

31:42.794 --> 31:45.606
- Where did you meet him?
- Stay strong.

31:45.630 --> 31:47.641
Location first, then give him the money.

31:48.056 --> 31:49.777
Lucas.

31:49.801 --> 31:51.612
Lucas. Lucas!

31:51.636 --> 31:53.147
I'll call you later on, all right?

31:53.171 --> 31:54.448
Damn it. Move in now!

31:56.140 --> 31:57.618
Lucas!

32:02.747 --> 32:04.959
You lying sack of...

32:04.983 --> 32:06.794
Get down!

32:06.818 --> 32:08.796
- Get down!
- Move, move!

32:10.421 --> 32:11.966
Oh!

32:11.990 --> 32:13.500
Get down!

32:13.524 --> 32:14.668
- Move!
- Get down!

32:14.692 --> 32:16.804
- Drop it!
- Get down!

32:18.029 --> 32:19.306
Ooh!

32:21.666 --> 32:23.477
Lucas! Lucas!

32:23.501 --> 32:25.679
Lucas! Lucas...

32:30.408 --> 32:31.719
It's okay.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.230
It's okay.

32:38.082 --> 32:41.028
No, no, no!

32:43.588 --> 32:44.832
It's okay.

32:44.856 --> 32:45.888
It's gonna be okay.

32:54.521 --> 32:55.951
This is my fault.

32:55.976 --> 32:58.354
- I screwed up.
- No, you did great.

32:58.378 --> 32:59.643
I shouldn't have given him the money.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.223
I didn't even get the location.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.799
Listen, we'll find the location.

33:02.823 --> 33:05.068
We'll find the drugs.
Don't worry about that.

33:05.509 --> 33:07.471
Sounded like he was ready
to hit the road,

33:07.495 --> 33:09.461
so I'm guessing his dope is close by.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.687
- Nothing back here.
- Yeah.

33:24.277 --> 33:25.862
There's nothing here either.

33:26.814 --> 33:28.240
Any luck?

33:28.783 --> 33:30.694
Nope. Nothing.

33:31.370 --> 33:32.763
- You have the keys on you?
- Yeah.

33:32.787 --> 33:34.118
Here, let me try something.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.321
Hop in. Shut the trunk.

33:48.615 --> 33:51.015
I already pushed it. Nothing happened.

34:00.815 --> 34:02.059
Okay, Chicago.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.629
I have a CI who installs these things.

34:05.653 --> 34:08.654
Engine has to be on and doors
closed in order for it to open.

34:10.791 --> 34:12.735
Okay, we got the dope.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.120
Now we just gotta figure out
where to deliver it to.

34:15.696 --> 34:17.007
Yep.

34:17.031 --> 34:19.909
We have Lucas' texts from
the phone he was carrying.

34:19.934 --> 34:21.511
Since Harper said he started
doing business

34:21.534 --> 34:23.282
with the Latin Players
about a month ago...

34:23.306 --> 34:25.047
- Yeah.
- We need to scrub that time period.

34:25.072 --> 34:27.117
There, on the 28th.
There's a text that says,

34:27.141 --> 34:29.585
"Meeting's at 2.
Let's do 9 instead of 8."

34:29.610 --> 34:31.396
"Let's do 9 instead of 8"?

34:31.420 --> 34:34.157
But the meeting's at 2:00.
Is that some sort of code?

34:34.181 --> 34:37.994
Well, here's Lucas' GPS data
from that day around that time.

34:38.018 --> 34:39.763
All right, so from 1:37 to 3:12,

34:39.786 --> 34:41.531
he was in Brooklyn down by the river.

34:41.554 --> 34:43.632
- Kristen, can you zoom in?
- Mm-hmm.

34:43.657 --> 34:45.168
Get a more specific look at this.

34:45.192 --> 34:47.670
Yeah, over here.
Can you drill down right there?

34:47.695 --> 34:49.027
Okay.

34:51.478 --> 34:53.745
They met at 2:00 at a dock.

34:54.969 --> 34:56.679
Pier nine instead of pier eight.

34:56.704 --> 34:59.404
- That's the meeting place.
- There it is.

35:02.977 --> 35:06.957
We've got 67 minutes to get
the drugs down to pier nine.

35:06.981 --> 35:09.459
Unfortunately, the guy
we need to deliver the drugs

35:09.483 --> 35:11.343
is at the city morgue.

35:15.623 --> 35:17.567
I'll go under as Lucas' friend.

35:17.591 --> 35:19.736
I'll give him the coke
in exchange for Harper's dad.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.071
No. These guys have done their homework.

35:21.095 --> 35:22.339
They're not gonna buy that.

35:22.363 --> 35:24.241
I get it, but I think I can pull it off.

35:24.689 --> 35:27.477
No, I agree with OA. It's too risky.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.234
So we need a plan C.

35:30.938 --> 35:32.280
Let me do it.

35:33.198 --> 35:35.185
He's my father.

35:35.450 --> 35:38.488
I'm the one who got him
into this awful situation.

35:38.828 --> 35:40.357
So let me do it.

35:40.664 --> 35:42.425
Let me do something meaningful.

35:42.449 --> 35:45.095
Something that will make me
feel good about myself...

35:46.541 --> 35:47.697
Please.

35:50.891 --> 35:52.992
Gotta let me do it.

36:03.464 --> 36:04.652
You're gonna do great.

36:04.676 --> 36:06.249
Just follow the plan we laid out.

36:06.273 --> 36:08.885
He doesn't get the second
bag until you see your father.

36:08.909 --> 36:11.021
Right. Got it.

36:11.045 --> 36:13.256
And if your dad's not
at the meeting place,

36:13.280 --> 36:15.392
you tell the man to bring him there.

36:15.416 --> 36:17.427
He'll say no. You stand your ground.

36:18.117 --> 36:19.729
You have more leverage than you think.

36:19.753 --> 36:21.264
This dope is worth a lot of money,

36:21.288 --> 36:23.133
and that's all they really care about.

36:24.437 --> 36:25.735
It's okay to be nervous.

36:25.759 --> 36:27.192
They'd be suspicious if you weren't.

36:32.007 --> 36:33.133
You good?

36:33.968 --> 36:35.176
I'm good.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.269
Okay.

36:47.314 --> 36:48.491
Okay.

36:48.515 --> 36:49.816
Here we go.

36:50.284 --> 36:52.351
Alpha team in position.

37:41.568 --> 37:43.203
Where's Lucas?

37:43.837 --> 37:45.288
He sent me instead.

37:47.847 --> 37:49.347
And my product?

37:59.353 --> 38:01.865
There's only one kilo here.

38:01.889 --> 38:03.633
The other four are close by.

38:03.657 --> 38:05.368
Close by doesn't do me no good.

38:05.392 --> 38:07.103
Show me where my father is,

38:07.127 --> 38:09.539
and I'll get you the other four.

38:09.563 --> 38:11.207
Don't get cute with me, mama.

38:11.231 --> 38:13.977
I'll cut your throat.

38:14.484 --> 38:16.379
Go get my dope.

38:16.403 --> 38:17.814
Let's get ready to move in.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.189
No, no. Give her a chance.

38:20.140 --> 38:22.319
You trying to get your dad killed?

38:22.343 --> 38:25.555
'Cause that's what's happen
if you keep playing.

38:25.579 --> 38:29.159
- I need to see him.
- He's alive.

38:29.183 --> 38:31.361
I promise.

38:31.793 --> 38:33.919
I need proof.

38:42.563 --> 38:44.363
Right over there, chica.

38:46.467 --> 38:48.573
Okay, we got eyes on the dad.
We're good to go.

38:48.597 --> 38:49.573
Wait, wait, wait.

38:49.597 --> 38:51.246
Let's see if we can get him
talking about Aman's murder.

38:52.489 --> 38:54.284
As soon as we see a weapon, we roll.

38:54.308 --> 38:55.585
Okay.

38:55.609 --> 38:58.888
Be a good girl, go get my dope.

38:58.912 --> 39:00.446
Do that,

39:01.348 --> 39:03.281
Big Papa walks.

39:07.293 --> 39:09.227
I'll go with you.

39:18.799 --> 39:20.091
So...

39:20.934 --> 39:22.260
So...

39:23.553 --> 39:25.782
How do I know you're not gonna
kill me and my father

39:25.806 --> 39:27.348
once I give you the dope?

39:27.841 --> 39:31.436
I don't kill civilians. Bad for business.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.391
You kill that Indian guy?

39:34.731 --> 39:35.992
He was a civilian.

39:36.016 --> 39:40.352
I try my best, but I'm not perfect, mama.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.099
You did good, Harper.

40:19.993 --> 40:21.819
FBI! Don't move!

40:21.843 --> 40:23.506
Drop your weapon now!

40:23.530 --> 40:25.475
Let me see your hands now!

40:28.102 --> 40:30.113
- Hands up!
- Put the gun on the ground!

40:31.191 --> 40:33.116
Step away! Put it down now!

40:33.140 --> 40:35.959
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground, now!

40:39.046 --> 40:40.123
Dad!

40:40.147 --> 40:42.125
Oh!

40:42.149 --> 40:43.726
Let me go!

40:43.750 --> 40:45.361
Dad!

40:45.385 --> 40:46.996
Dad!

40:47.020 --> 40:49.666
Dad!

41:06.840 --> 41:08.562
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:08.586 --> 41:10.386
I just filed my 302.
Do you need help with yours?

41:10.410 --> 41:12.120
Nah, I just finished.

41:12.913 --> 41:16.833
So, I have to admit,
I wasn't so sure about you.

41:17.718 --> 41:19.829
Yeah, well, I wasn't sure
about you either.

41:19.853 --> 41:22.754
But you're all right. For a fed.

41:25.092 --> 41:26.384
You wanna grab a beer?

41:27.468 --> 41:28.845
I'm okay.

41:29.930 --> 41:31.741
You don't have to look after the new kid.

41:31.765 --> 41:35.351
I am pretty sure
you don't need looking after.

41:36.236 --> 41:38.114
Come on, you saved my life.

41:38.138 --> 41:39.949
The least you can do
is let me buy you a drink.

41:39.973 --> 41:42.774
For the tenth time,
I didn't save your life.

41:45.879 --> 41:47.524
All right, let's grab a beer,

41:47.548 --> 41:49.859
but only if you tell me
why you became a fed.

41:49.883 --> 41:50.927
I told you my reason.

41:50.951 --> 41:52.562
It's only fair you tell me yours.

41:52.785 --> 41:54.297
Deal.
