WEBVTT

00:02.447 --> 00:05.771
Introducing...
Louie, Incorporated!

00:06.120 --> 00:08.555
It's a business.
It's a dream.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.491
It's a movement.

00:10.607 --> 00:13.111
Suits. Ties. Charts.

00:13.198 --> 00:14.952
Numbers. Yachts.

00:15.039 --> 00:17.280
Jet skis. You?

00:17.550 --> 00:21.100
Louie, Incorporated! It's a
dream, business, movement.

00:21.870 --> 00:23.849
- Did you
just do an Internet search

00:23.936 --> 00:25.330
for the word "business"?

00:25.417 --> 00:26.636
That's a trade secret.

00:26.723 --> 00:28.382
So is it...

00:28.525 --> 00:30.414
some kind of
lemonade stand or...?

00:30.501 --> 00:33.897
It's a dream of tomorrow
made manifest today.

00:35.511 --> 00:38.185
Okay, so there's some things
I haven't figured out yet.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.975
Like what your business
sells, does, and is.

00:41.062 --> 00:44.349
Sure, yeah, but... this
business is everything to me.

00:44.436 --> 00:47.333
I want to be a successful
businessman like you,

00:47.420 --> 00:49.491
'cause you're, like,
my idol and...

00:49.611 --> 00:51.671
possibly angel investor?

00:52.190 --> 00:54.555
You cannae just set out
to make money.

00:54.642 --> 00:57.725
You have to find a problem
and offer a solution.

00:57.812 --> 00:59.707
My problem is,
I need money.

00:59.794 --> 01:03.100
And if you would just give it to
me already, problem solutioned.

01:03.187 --> 01:06.538
Louie, Louie, Louie.
Look at your Uncle Donald.

01:06.644 --> 01:08.907
He saw there was a housing
shortage in Duckburg,

01:08.994 --> 01:11.055
so he's renting out the spare
room in his houseboat.

01:11.142 --> 01:12.439
Problem, solution.

01:12.526 --> 01:15.605
He's helping people, and...
Is he stealing my chandelier?

01:15.692 --> 01:17.034
Oi!

01:18.901 --> 01:21.642
But it takes money
to make money, right?

01:21.729 --> 01:25.132
I just need a tiny little bit,
and I'll get out of your hair.

01:25.362 --> 01:27.616
All right, lad.
How much do you need?

01:27.706 --> 01:29.651
2.5 billion, please.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:41.848 --> 01:43.254
Fancy!

01:44.568 --> 01:46.372
Waah! Earthquake!

01:46.459 --> 01:49.029
Batten down the hatches!

01:52.834 --> 01:54.470
Aw, phooey!

01:54.584 --> 01:56.207
O glorious day!

01:56.294 --> 01:59.225
The gods smile
upon our meeting. Ha, ha!

01:59.312 --> 02:01.192
Storkules?
You gotta go.

02:01.279 --> 02:03.265
My new tenant will
be here any minute.

02:03.352 --> 02:05.867
Me wonderest what blessed
soul be so fortunate

02:05.954 --> 02:09.068
as to share quarters with
the legendary Donald Duck, hmm?

02:09.155 --> 02:12.331
I don't know. Go,
before you scare him away!

02:12.418 --> 02:14.867
But wouldst that
even be possible

02:14.954 --> 02:17.185
if your new roommate
were incapable

02:17.272 --> 02:20.618
of feeling fear, hmm?

02:21.279 --> 02:22.278
Oh, no.

02:22.365 --> 02:25.765
If indeed he were the Defender
of Delphi, the Lion of Lindos...

02:25.852 --> 02:27.948
- Oh, no.
- For what if he

02:28.035 --> 02:30.462
be I, Storkules!

02:30.560 --> 02:32.431
Slumber party!

Episode Title :
<font color=#FFFF00>"Storkules in Duckburg!"</font>

03:35.124 --> 03:36.536
Ah! Ha, ha!

03:36.623 --> 03:38.154
Why, oh, why?

03:38.241 --> 03:40.551
Why do our journeys
cosmically intersect

03:40.638 --> 03:42.159
like Damon and Pythias?

03:42.246 --> 03:44.145
No, why are you here?

03:44.232 --> 03:47.023
Oh. Father Zeus grew
agitated with my lute playing,

03:47.110 --> 03:49.667
so he rained a hail of harpies
upon my merriment,

03:49.754 --> 03:51.536
causing much chaos
in Maceduckia.

03:51.623 --> 03:53.551
As punishment
for my childish gaiety,

03:53.638 --> 03:56.222
Father cast me out
and ordered me to become...

03:56.309 --> 03:57.693
a responsible adult.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.816
So I thought,
who better to teach me

03:59.903 --> 04:02.579
than the most responsible
man I know?

04:02.959 --> 04:04.733
Oh...

04:04.850 --> 04:07.583
A successful business must
find a problem and solve it.

04:07.670 --> 04:10.380
And that, my employees, is what
we are here to figure out.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.464
We're not your employees,
we're your family.

04:12.551 --> 04:16.002
At Louie Inc., family are the
greatest employees of all.

04:16.161 --> 04:18.370
I mean, except Dewey. Dewey
would make a terrible employee.

04:20.373 --> 04:22.635
This is clearly
a bad idea.

04:22.726 --> 04:25.051
Well, then, I guess
Webby will have to be

04:25.138 --> 04:27.273
- Chief Chart Officer.
- Ooh!

04:27.360 --> 04:29.864
Yeah. Gonna need a lot of charts.
And checklists.

04:29.951 --> 04:32.575
Plus maybe checklists for those charts.
Webby'll be great.

04:32.662 --> 04:34.674
Gah! Okay, fine. I'm in!

04:34.866 --> 04:36.746
Okay team, let's brainstorm.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.528
What do people need?

04:38.615 --> 04:41.233
Infinite cookies! Crocheted
hand grenade holders!

04:41.320 --> 04:43.800
Oh! Free hugs! -Why don't
you just sell lemonade?

04:43.887 --> 04:46.091
Ugh. Lemonade
is small potatoes.

04:46.178 --> 04:48.060
Oh! Potato-ade!

05:04.135 --> 05:07.161
Cohabitant Donald!
Good morrow!

05:07.248 --> 05:10.761
My kitchen! -Oh, Donald,
'twas nearly disastrous.

05:10.848 --> 05:13.193
Your sto-o-ve...

05:13.280 --> 05:15.580
made a horrible hissing sound
when activated.

05:15.667 --> 05:18.171
Clearly a foe filled it
with dangerous vipers.

05:18.258 --> 05:20.269
So I wrested
the infernal snake box

05:20.356 --> 05:22.572
from the wall
and threw it to safety!

05:24.638 --> 05:26.356
But now, we eat

05:26.443 --> 05:28.697
and restore
our heroic vigor.

05:28.820 --> 05:31.619
So... how long
do you plan to stay?

05:31.706 --> 05:35.713
Why, until I become a
responsible adult like you.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.927
"Roommate Responsibility."

05:40.014 --> 05:41.921
What hallowed creed be this?

05:42.008 --> 05:44.910
"Quiet hours
from 7:00 to 6:00." Hmm.

05:44.997 --> 05:47.942
"Don't use my toothpaste."
Uh-huh.

05:48.029 --> 05:49.983
And pay your rent on time.

05:50.070 --> 05:52.063
Rent? Why,
I assumed I'd pay

05:52.150 --> 05:54.306
with good cheer
and eternal friendship.

05:54.393 --> 05:55.779
Ahoy-hoy!

05:57.795 --> 06:01.761
- "Friendship is not money." Hmm.
- You need a job.

06:01.848 --> 06:05.773
By Helios's Chariot!
A jo-o-b.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.653
That sounds most responsible.

06:12.490 --> 06:14.416
They followed me
from Greece!

06:14.547 --> 06:17.128
I must wrangle those wretches
so I can get back to

06:17.215 --> 06:20.400
my glorious labor
of roommate responsibility.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.037
No pets!

06:22.139 --> 06:24.191
By the way, there is orzo
in the slow cooker.

06:24.278 --> 06:25.381
Do not open it...

06:25.468 --> 06:29.064
lest the pasta fail
to absorb the broth!

06:29.209 --> 06:31.267
- Bye!
- Waah!

06:33.217 --> 06:35.692
But, Louie, how can we have
a corporate retreat

06:35.779 --> 06:37.666
if we don't even know
what the business is yet?

06:37.764 --> 06:40.192
That's why we're here...
To kick loose.

06:40.279 --> 06:41.989
You know,
let the creativity flow.

06:42.076 --> 06:44.261
We'll come up with
a business idea in no time.

06:44.348 --> 06:47.135
Hmm. We've already spent
our entire annual budget

06:47.222 --> 06:49.618
on skee-ball,
so... company done?

06:49.794 --> 06:51.809
Everyone relax, okay?

06:51.896 --> 06:55.341
Our company just needs to
find a problem to solve.

07:02.746 --> 07:05.235
Just any problem at all.

07:15.896 --> 07:17.620
My eyes!
My delicate costume eyes!

07:21.119 --> 07:23.293
Sit! Heel! Shoo!

07:24.285 --> 07:25.287
Ha!

07:32.810 --> 07:35.284
<i>Where fun is in the...</i>

07:46.405 --> 07:49.472
Harpies, be gone!

07:51.204 --> 07:53.293
Woo-hoo-hoo!
Thank you, kind sir!

07:53.380 --> 07:55.646
You saved us!
How can I repay you?

07:55.733 --> 07:58.520
A hero labors not for
personal gain, only...

07:58.607 --> 07:59.928
$500 plus tax.

08:00.015 --> 08:02.024
We also accept
Funzo Bucks.

08:02.608 --> 08:03.659
You're hired!

08:04.380 --> 08:06.745
You mean, a job?

08:06.866 --> 08:09.381
Welcome to Harp-B-Gone,

08:09.468 --> 08:12.440
- a division of Louie Inc.
- Hurrah!

08:17.888 --> 08:20.421
Oh, roommate
responsibility.

08:22.562 --> 08:25.175
Oh, no. The toga holder.

08:28.405 --> 08:29.856
What's going on?

08:29.943 --> 08:31.534
Oh, nothing.

08:33.419 --> 08:34.730
Just going to work.

08:34.857 --> 08:36.232
I'm off to my job.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.121
Nothing like the dignity

08:38.208 --> 08:40.323
of a hard day's labor.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.262
Mother, Father, what a
beautiful and harpy-free day

08:45.349 --> 08:47.972
for a helpless mortal tot
like me to enjoy.

08:48.077 --> 08:50.451
Goo-goo and gah-gah!

08:50.538 --> 08:54.255
Yes, sirree. So glad
there's no harpies around.

08:54.342 --> 08:55.654
Right, sweetums?

08:55.741 --> 08:57.801
You said it, hubby.
Who wrote this?

08:58.333 --> 08:59.341
A harpy!

08:59.428 --> 09:02.545
Oh, what's a hapless babe
to do?

09:02.632 --> 09:05.091
I hath made
a mighty boom boom

09:05.178 --> 09:07.324
in my diapie!

09:08.312 --> 09:09.654
I'm Louie Duck,

09:09.741 --> 09:12.077
founder and C.E.O.
of Harp-B-Gone.

09:12.164 --> 09:15.044
We're the leading task force
dedicated to humanely capturing

09:15.131 --> 09:17.716
those pesky winged beasts
infesting Duckburg.

09:17.803 --> 09:20.005
Remember,
if you hear a "skree,"

09:20.092 --> 09:22.136
call Louie.

09:23.161 --> 09:25.560
Harp-B-Gone not responsible for any
shredding, pecking, clawing, tinnitus,

09:25.647 --> 09:28.144
exploding ear drums and-or
permanent fear of birds.

09:28.279 --> 09:29.958
Employer Llewellyn,
if I may,

09:30.045 --> 09:32.950
why do we play dress-up when
there are still harpies afoot?

09:33.037 --> 09:36.046
If someone sees a harpy,
they have to know who to call

09:36.133 --> 09:38.209
and pay lots of money
to get rid of it.

09:38.296 --> 09:40.364
You better hope someone calls,
because we're already broke.

09:40.451 --> 09:42.702
Guys, are the harpies
really so bad?

09:42.789 --> 09:45.810
Instead of capturing them, why don't
we just channel their passion

09:45.897 --> 09:47.824
into something positive
for society.

09:47.929 --> 09:50.694
The problem can't be
the solution, Webby.

09:50.781 --> 09:51.772
That's just business.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.130
If we're gonna trap them, we're gonna
have to figure out what they want.

09:54.217 --> 09:57.235
No mortal can know the mind
of the featherless beast face.

09:57.383 --> 09:59.609
Ha! The Junior Woodchuck
Guidebook knows.

09:59.726 --> 10:02.663
Harpies: flying beats of myth
that steal... -

10:03.023 --> 10:04.675
Oh, no!
The thing I love most!

10:07.500 --> 10:09.466
"Steals the thing
you love most."

10:09.553 --> 10:12.097
Huh, says it
right there. Hmm.

10:13.086 --> 10:14.722
We're in business!

10:16.742 --> 10:19.646
Harp-B-Gone, please hold.
Harp-B Gone, please hold.

11:34.140 --> 11:36.850
<i>L-L-Live from McDuck Manor,</i>

11:36.937 --> 11:39.460
<i>it's</i> Dewey Dewnight,
<i>with our very special guests,</i>

11:39.547 --> 11:41.552
<i>the hottest name in
supernatural pest removal,</i>

11:41.639 --> 11:44.183
<i>Harp-B-Gone!</i>

11:45.093 --> 11:48.014
So-ho, Louie,
my bro, C.E.O.,

11:48.101 --> 11:50.199
what's next for
Harp-B-Gone?

11:50.367 --> 11:52.671
Merchandise!
I gotta tell you,

11:52.758 --> 11:54.872
selling out is everything
I've dreamed it would be.

11:54.959 --> 11:56.778
We got Harpy-B-Gone
pop-up books...

11:59.203 --> 12:01.855
The harpy talon
grabber arm.

12:03.303 --> 12:07.147
And the kids love this one...
The harpy skree-mask.

12:07.234 --> 12:09.913
Foul hex of Hades, they've reproduced!

12:10.537 --> 12:13.139
Stop squirming,
vile harpy child!

12:13.226 --> 12:15.194
Storkules, it's me, Huey!

12:15.281 --> 12:16.826
So you've been at this
for weeks.

12:16.913 --> 12:18.560
When are these Harp-B's

12:18.647 --> 12:21.628
finally gonna B gone?
[laughs

12:21.715 --> 12:24.839
Who knows? Years, decades,
hopefully never?

12:24.937 --> 12:27.499
Worry not. The harpies
are vanquished.

12:27.586 --> 12:30.432
We captured the last cur today!
Huzzah!

12:30.510 --> 12:33.386
We what? Meeting at
headquarters in 10 seconds.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.138
Storkules, the harpies
aren't really gone, are they?

12:44.275 --> 12:45.532
Indeed they are.

12:45.619 --> 12:48.406
Our business endeavor
is a smashing success!

12:48.493 --> 12:52.490
And my heroic labor of
responsibility is nigh complete!

12:52.594 --> 12:56.907
There's no business
without the harpies!

12:56.994 --> 13:00.366
But I thought wrangling the beasts
was the point of the business.

13:00.453 --> 13:03.224
The point of the business
is to make money!

13:03.345 --> 13:05.366
Or we could work
with the harpies.

13:05.453 --> 13:06.904
I've been training them.

13:06.991 --> 13:10.417
I already got them to roll
over a couple of times...

13:10.767 --> 13:12.446
before they gnawed
through the floor.

13:12.533 --> 13:14.603
I've been figured out how
to get them to listen, and...

13:14.690 --> 13:16.200
Or we could keep
the monsters locked up,

13:16.287 --> 13:18.076
you can pay us,
and we'll call it a day.

13:18.181 --> 13:20.048
Oh, yeah.

13:20.135 --> 13:22.178
Right. No problem.
Yeah.

13:22.265 --> 13:24.588
I'll just reach
into my pocket,

13:24.675 --> 13:26.471
where the money is...

13:26.743 --> 13:32.255
and your money
is comi-i-i-ing...

13:32.400 --> 13:33.991
You spent all the money on the
merchandise, didn't you?

13:34.078 --> 13:35.051
Yep, sure did.

13:35.138 --> 13:37.366
But we can sell it
and make billions!

13:37.453 --> 13:41.982
Or I could pay you
in-in grabber arms, perhaps?

13:43.681 --> 13:45.319
I cannot pay my rent.

13:45.406 --> 13:49.872
I hath failed my heroic
labor of responsibility.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.036
If I be not a hero,

13:52.123 --> 13:54.550
be I a... zero?

14:00.009 --> 14:01.798
Don't worry, Storkules.

14:01.885 --> 14:03.787
I will figure something out.

14:18.905 --> 14:19.905
What?

14:19.992 --> 14:23.460
Huh? What? Huh?

14:25.457 --> 14:26.675
Ah...

14:40.578 --> 14:42.586
Corporate Overlord
Llewellyn!

14:43.840 --> 14:44.910
What art thou doing?

14:44.997 --> 14:47.838
I just wanted to check to see
if they were locked in safely.

14:49.137 --> 14:52.081
Yep, everything looks good,
so you can just go, I guess.

14:52.457 --> 14:55.424
Of course! Employer Llewellyn,
you have the honesty

14:55.511 --> 14:57.209
and integrity
of a true hero,

14:57.340 --> 15:00.678
- just like your uncle.
- Fine.

15:00.765 --> 15:04.157
I was gonna let them out, okay?
I have to save the business!

15:09.278 --> 15:10.918
Quick, hide!

15:12.364 --> 15:15.269
Sometimes your solution
to a problem is so good,

15:15.356 --> 15:16.649
there's no more problem,

15:16.749 --> 15:18.428
which is itself a problem,

15:18.515 --> 15:20.366
so you have to make
a new problem

15:20.453 --> 15:22.236
so you can sell
a solution.

15:22.323 --> 15:23.919
Do you see my problem?

15:26.262 --> 15:29.847
Oh, vexing riddle!
If we unleash the savages,

15:29.934 --> 15:33.360
they'll destroy Duckburg and take
countless innocent lives, but...

15:33.489 --> 15:35.197
if we leave them here,

15:35.284 --> 15:37.669
I'll miss my rent payment.

15:43.231 --> 15:46.425
Help, lest
the harpies disturb

15:46.512 --> 15:49.235
Donald's
delicate slumber!

15:52.126 --> 15:54.274
Hey, what's going on?

15:55.725 --> 15:57.367
Just, you know,

15:57.527 --> 15:59.036
getting a midnight snack.

15:59.123 --> 16:00.906
Rumbles in the tumbles.

16:03.154 --> 16:05.674
We should let you get back
to your beauty rest.

16:05.761 --> 16:07.502
Not that
your classical visage

16:07.589 --> 16:09.786
could get
any more statuesque.

16:09.873 --> 16:12.116
Yep.
Whatever he said.

16:18.239 --> 16:19.402
What is that?

16:19.489 --> 16:21.214
It's just a... a pet.

16:21.301 --> 16:23.041
They followed us home,
Uncle Donald.

16:23.128 --> 16:25.277
Can we keep 'em?
Please?

16:25.364 --> 16:27.191
I told you... no pets!

16:27.278 --> 16:30.392
Honorable Donald, please!
I can explain! Listen...

16:30.479 --> 16:31.798
No! You're out!

16:31.885 --> 16:34.180
- You and your pets!
- No, Donald!

16:34.267 --> 16:37.250
No! You mustn't
let the beasts out!

16:52.851 --> 16:55.058
Down! Heel!

16:55.145 --> 16:57.508
What did you do, Louie?

16:59.457 --> 17:01.597
Oh, magnanimous Donald,
please see it fit

17:01.684 --> 17:03.290
in your saintly heart
to forgive me.

17:03.377 --> 17:07.297
I only did it to honor
your most hallowed house rules.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.252
Just go away!

17:09.339 --> 17:11.611
Donald, no!
Our treasured friendship

17:11.698 --> 17:14.422
is one the thing
I love most!

17:17.404 --> 17:20.461
Uncle Donald!

17:21.067 --> 17:22.612
That was most unwise
of me.

17:22.699 --> 17:26.446
What the... The solution to the problem
became an even bigger problem!

17:26.534 --> 17:29.183
Unless... Oh, no,
I'm the problem!

17:29.270 --> 17:30.853
Yes, of course.
Obviously!

17:30.940 --> 17:33.214
No,<i> this</i> is the problem!

17:33.301 --> 17:34.402
Waah!

17:37.379 --> 17:38.415
Humbled Llewellyn,

17:38.502 --> 17:41.656
are you prepared
to do the right thing?

17:45.135 --> 17:47.285
Okay, yes.

17:47.839 --> 17:49.789
Wait! No!
I take that back!

17:50.845 --> 17:56.672
Friend Donald!

17:56.762 --> 18:01.601
Harpies, get ready to B gone!
Trademark: Louie Duck.

18:10.113 --> 18:11.736
We'd better think fast.

18:11.823 --> 18:13.823
- Just let us down!
- No!

18:13.910 --> 18:15.831
We're a hundred feet high!

18:21.539 --> 18:23.068
Uncle Donald!

18:24.762 --> 18:25.957
Hold on!

18:26.863 --> 18:29.776
Roommate Donald, I dare not
disrespect your boundaries,

18:29.863 --> 18:32.658
but may I have permission
to enter your personal space

18:32.745 --> 18:35.111
for the sole purpose
of saving your life?

18:35.198 --> 18:36.605
Yes, yes!

18:37.686 --> 18:39.539
My beloved merch!

18:43.498 --> 18:44.827
Help!

18:51.082 --> 18:52.533
Goodbye, Harp-B-Gone,

18:52.620 --> 18:55.187
a subsidiary
of Louie, Incorporated.

19:15.885 --> 19:17.121
Aah!

19:20.388 --> 19:21.705
What are you doing?

19:21.792 --> 19:23.590
Solving the problem.

19:39.082 --> 19:41.415
What a fine home you've made,
noble Donald.

19:41.502 --> 19:43.986
And for a brief moment,
as your roommate,

19:44.073 --> 19:46.354
I tasted that perfection.

19:46.441 --> 19:49.058
But alas,
it seems I be not worthy

19:49.145 --> 19:52.664
to share quarters with
the noblest duck in the world.

19:54.543 --> 19:58.344
Okay, fine.
You can stay.

19:58.723 --> 20:00.922
- Ha, ha!
- In an apartment,

20:01.020 --> 20:02.659
and I'll help you
find it.

20:02.746 --> 20:04.470
Father will be most proud!

20:04.557 --> 20:08.814
I shall never forget this,
my inseparable chum, Donald!

20:08.901 --> 20:12.525
Oh! Nor your grave lesson
of roommate etiquette

20:12.612 --> 20:14.789
and personal space.

20:23.887 --> 20:25.503
Where were you?

20:28.535 --> 20:31.017
Had a business opportunity
in Cape Suzette.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.023
So, you lost it all,
did you?

20:33.113 --> 20:34.623
Yep. Big-time.

20:35.316 --> 20:37.351
Oh, here's
your investment back.

20:37.551 --> 20:40.992
Consider it payment
for that new idea you gave me.

20:41.899 --> 20:44.110
You opened
a lemonade business?

20:46.246 --> 20:48.370
Enjoy it.
That's the only can.

20:48.457 --> 20:51.369
We couldn't figure out a cost-effective
way to transport the lemons

20:51.456 --> 20:54.336
from Cape Suzette
to the juicery in town.

20:57.886 --> 20:58.960
Huh?

20:59.552 --> 21:00.612
No!

21:00.699 --> 21:02.605
Heel! Sit!

21:07.465 --> 21:11.094
Huh. No one ever asked
what <i> they</i> love most.

21:15.098 --> 21:18.103
Looks like Scrooge McDuck
is turning lemons

21:18.190 --> 21:19.659
into lemonade?

21:19.746 --> 21:21.406
Mr. McDuck's new
Fair Trade Lemonade

21:21.493 --> 21:23.678
is 100% organic
and sustainable,

21:23.765 --> 21:27.194
from the farm-fresh lemons
shipped in from Cape Suzette

21:27.281 --> 21:30.950
to the rehabilitated harpies
that deliver and squeeze them.

21:32.118 --> 21:33.867
That's right, Roxanne.

21:33.954 --> 21:36.614
No shipping costs,
no fuel emissions.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.840
And we pay them
in the thing they love most:

21:38.927 --> 21:40.754
delicious
McDuck Brand Lemonade.

21:40.852 --> 21:42.758
Hup!
Because as C.D.O.,

21:42.845 --> 21:46.248
- Chief Delivery Officer...
- Unpaid intern.

21:46.335 --> 21:47.983
Not now.
I believe in

21:48.070 --> 21:50.491
turning problems
into solutions.

21:50.578 --> 21:53.902
But how do you keep the harpies
from stealing all your lemonade?

21:56.906 --> 21:59.554
We are still working
on that particular problem.
