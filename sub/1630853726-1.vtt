WEBVTT

00:04.045 --> 00:05.463
Welcome back to Seabrook.

00:07.716 --> 00:11.928
We started off as a perfectly
planned community full of cheer.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.431
-Then zombies showed up.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.765
And then werewolves.

00:16.391 --> 00:21.438
So, naturally, well, supernaturally,
we had some bumps along the way.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.735
But now, we've all learned
to live together, united.

00:28.403 --> 00:31.031
Seabrook is becoming a perfect place.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.074
Well, almost.

00:33.158 --> 00:38.371
Monsters still have one big barrier to
break through, like getting into college.

00:38.455 --> 00:41.082
But if we win
the championship football game tonight,

00:41.166 --> 00:44.044
we're going to have
our first zombie recruited to college.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.839
And the doors to higher ed
will be open to all monsters.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.967
-And then we'll all be together.

00:51.051 --> 00:55.638
And maybe, in college, one special
girl with white hair won't stand out.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.600
And maybe she'll even find
a place where she belongs.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.518
So win tonight's football game,

01:00.602 --> 01:03.271
and everything in Seabrook
will be perfect.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.649
So we can't let anything get in our way.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.951
Hey, happy-very-go-lucky Zombie Zed here.

01:17.994 --> 01:21.623
In Seabrook, humans, zombies,
and werewolves are on the same team.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.208
Hey, what up, dude?

01:23.291 --> 01:24.167
Yeah, Zed.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.502
-Hey, Zed.
-Yo.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.962
-Thanks to you, I'm a brand-new man.
-Yes.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.465
No more going to the mall in pajama pants.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.884
-Yeah.
-And no more living in my mom's basement.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.095
-Thank you, Zed!

01:35.178 --> 01:36.471
Hi, Mom!

01:36.554 --> 01:39.432
I am so pumped
for tonight's championship game.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.558
I prepared a victory dance.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.018
-You wanna see it?
-Absolutely.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.896


01:44.979 --> 01:47.315
All right. Poppin' and lockin'. Okay.

01:47.399 --> 01:51.528
Tonight's game is really important, Coach.
So I scripted all of our plays.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.113
Oh, thank you so much, Zed.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.906
-This is gonna help us a lot.
-I got you.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.157
Thank you. See you.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.243


01:59.369 --> 02:01.204


02:02.163 --> 02:04.874


02:04.958 --> 02:05.792
Hit!

02:06.835 --> 02:07.836


02:10.380 --> 02:11.923
-Hey!

02:13.842 --> 02:15.635


02:16.219 --> 02:19.597
All right, all right, all right,
we gotta keep our energy up tonight, boys.

02:19.681 --> 02:23.184
Peanut butter for you,
bone and beef for you,

02:23.268 --> 02:25.020
and blended brains for me.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.814
You have to win
this football game tonight, Zed.

02:27.897 --> 02:31.192
Win tonight, and you'll be
the first zombie to ever attend college.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.819
I will. Don't worry.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.070
My little sister, Zoey.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.532
Zombie-kind's depending on you,
so we can all go to college.

02:37.615 --> 02:38.700
No pressure.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.285
My hacktivist best friend, Eliza.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.954
She's interning at Z-Corp,
maker of the Z-Band.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.498
Yeah, I know.
My zom-girl's breaking the glass ceiling.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.293
Literally. I broke the glass ceiling today
testing a prototype.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.920
I am so getting recruited
to Mountain College.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.631
This is gonna be a small step
for zombies everywhere,

02:53.715 --> 02:55.550
and a giant step for me, because--

02:56.051 --> 02:57.719
Hi, I'm Addison.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.889
And as cheer captain,
it's my duty to support Seabrook.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.057
But this is personal.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.475
I'm going to Mountain College,

03:03.558 --> 03:06.269
and I really need Zed
to win tonight's game and join me.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.979
So let's cheer our team to victory.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.148

You guys, tonight is our last chance
to cheer at a Seabrook football game.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.662


04:05.745 --> 04:08.832
I know. I wish we could be
cheerleaders forever too.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.917
Maybe we should flunk science
so high school never ends.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.085
Um...

04:12.168 --> 04:14.587
Nah, we just have too much chemistry.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.297
We are so gonna win tonight.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.299
-And when we do…
-We'll be together forever.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.552
Aw!

04:21.136 --> 04:23.638
-When I say Sea, you say Brook. Sea.
-Brook.

04:23.722 --> 04:24.723
-Sea.
-Brook.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.072
Our moonstones are acting weird, Wyatt.
Something big is happening.

04:44.325 --> 04:48.204
Something big is happening.
Biggest football game in the universe.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.914
Just the biggest in Seabrook.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.919
Come on. You know how important
a win is for all us monsters.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.088
Seabrook needs you, cheer wolf.

04:57.172 --> 05:00.717
You want a fierce werewolf leader
to rally a football team?

05:00.800 --> 05:01.801
Come on.

05:08.391 --> 05:12.479
Let's tear these Eastside Eels apart.
Destroy them! Yeah!

05:17.442 --> 05:19.694
Maybe just a bit too much school spirit.

05:19.778 --> 05:23.365
Get our Mighty Shrimp on this bus
so we can defend our turf.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.826
No outsiders mess with our pack. Yeah!

05:29.871 --> 05:30.872
Whoo, whoo!

05:31.790 --> 05:35.335
When you're from Seabrook,
you are Seabrook.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.671
-Seabrook!
-Seabrook, Seabrook!

05:37.754 --> 05:39.964
-Seabrook, Seabrook!
-Seabrook! Seabrook!

05:41.299 --> 05:43.593
-Yeah!

05:43.677 --> 05:44.511
Eliza.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.637
Hey, Wyatt.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.223
I-I can't believe you're not here
for this. We all miss you.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.309
-Who misses her the most, Wyatt?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.479
Wait, what'd she say?
I couldn't hear what she said.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.440
Okay, everyone, let's give it up
for our football team

05:57.524 --> 05:59.025
as they head off to victory.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.527
Here they come!

06:00.610 --> 06:02.696
-

06:07.158 --> 06:08.326
Ha!

06:09.202 --> 06:13.832
Thank you, thank you
for coming to see me off for my big game.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.209
You're not even on the football team,
Bucky.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.254
Um, that's President Bucky.

06:19.337 --> 06:23.633
And as president, all accomplishments
are my accomplishments.

06:23.717 --> 06:27.846
It's gonna be a banner year for me,
now that I've organized the…

06:27.929 --> 06:29.514
National Cheer Off?

06:29.597 --> 06:31.433
Addison organized the Cheer Off.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.643
She invited squads
from all over to compete.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.645
Oh! Ah!

06:35.729 --> 06:37.272
Go, Seabrook!

06:37.355 --> 06:41.401
Hey, Seabrook! Seabrook! Go, go, go, go!

06:43.236 --> 06:46.031
Go, boys!

06:46.114 --> 06:48.033
Whoo! Let's go.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.663
Hey, hey. You are going to kill it
out there tonight, okay?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.207
Those Eels think that
they can keep you caged up.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.834
They think they can keep you on a leash.

06:57.917 --> 07:02.422
But you are no cuddly puppy.
You are a fierce beast of the forest!

07:05.675 --> 07:08.887
-This shrimp be cray!
-So cray! Go, Wynter.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.139
-Whoo!

07:13.224 --> 07:14.142
Ooh!

07:14.225 --> 07:15.185
Ah!

07:16.061 --> 07:17.062
Too much?

07:18.229 --> 07:20.690
Never too much. You do you.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.736
Seabrook, Seabrook, Seabrook.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.488
Seabrook, Seabrook.

07:26.571 --> 07:30.992
Hey, check out the recruiter
from Mountain College. He looks nervous.

07:31.701 --> 07:36.164
Well, he's never seen monsters before.
But he's gotta recruit my boy, right?

07:36.247 --> 07:41.878
Oh, I'm-- I'm sure he will.
I mean, keep calm and zombie on, right?

07:41.961 --> 07:43.421
-Yeah. Yeah, right.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.842
I'm telling you,
Zed Necrodopolis is a star.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.761
Well, maybe on the football field,

07:49.844 --> 07:52.013
but do we really want a monster
in our classroom?

07:53.848 --> 07:56.142
Zombies and werewolves? Oh, my.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.395
It'll be fine.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.063
-Whoo!
-Come on.

08:03.775 --> 08:06.695
Hey, I'm Zed's dad. Nice to meet you.
We are so excited to meet you.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.113
This is it.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.739
-Together--
-Forever.

08:10.865 --> 08:11.866
Meteors.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.623
Since the werewolves
recovered the moonstone,

08:18.707 --> 08:20.458
meteor showers have been pretty regular.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.419
-It's so Seabrook.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.420
Come on!

08:23.503 --> 08:24.671
Oh! Here he is now.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.714
Oh, hi.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.424
I'm a recruiter from Mountain College...

08:28.675 --> 08:32.554
-...and we need… we need…

08:32.637 --> 08:34.764

08:36.307 --> 08:38.852

08:40.603 --> 08:41.604

08:44.232 --> 08:46.234

08:46.317 --> 08:47.360
Whoa.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.781
-I quit! I'll never leave home again!
-Wait, wait, wait! Don't go!

13:07.078 --> 13:11.499
For centuries, we have been
without a home, but I found utopia.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.502
The perfect new planet for our people.

13:14.586 --> 13:18.506
I hid the coordinates
in the most precious thing in Seabrook.

13:19.716 --> 13:20.800
Instrumomo.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.637
You must find the most precious thing
in Seabrook.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.264
Find the most precious thing--

13:26.348 --> 13:28.892
precious thing--
precious thing in Seabrook.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.727
The file is corrupted.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.729
We need to find their most precious thing.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.148
That's where we'll find our map to Utopia.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.523
Oops.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.442
It seems our arrival may have caused

15:00.525 --> 15:03.987
a small,
somewhat destructive energy surge.

15:04.070 --> 15:08.867
It appears these angry beings may not give
us their most precious thing willingly.

15:08.950 --> 15:12.412
Then we'll have to explain our presence
without telling them our mission.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.497
Oh!

15:17.709 --> 15:18.877
Huh.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.962
I'm thinking what you're thinking.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.715
Take us to your leader.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.385
Your cheerleader.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.096
-No.

15:30.847 --> 15:31.973
Hi.

15:32.057 --> 15:35.560
We accept your invitation
to the National Cheer Off.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.564
Z-Patrol, arrest them!

15:39.647 --> 15:40.482
Yes, sir!

15:40.565 --> 15:42.150
-Let's go!
-Move in! Move in!

15:42.233 --> 15:43.318
Hold right there!

15:46.988 --> 15:49.407
Great idea separating the aliens,
Principal Lee.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.619
Not my first time dealing
with spacey teens.

15:52.702 --> 15:56.706
They're probably here to clone me
to create an unstoppable cheer force.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.166
I mean, who wouldn't want more me?

15:58.249 --> 16:00.877
Well, they're uninvited and have to leave.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.172
But we invited everyone to our Cheer Off
to compete for the Seabrook Cup.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.465
Um...

16:05.548 --> 16:07.384
You can't just give away my bling.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.843
I don't intend to lose.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.263
And I always believed
that cheer could bring people together.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.973
Maybe even worlds together.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.101
Or tear our worlds apart.

16:16.184 --> 16:21.064
Mark my words,
these aliens are here to take what's ours.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.233
-Okay.

16:24.275 --> 16:27.529
Greetings.
Did you want me to continue waiting alone?

16:27.612 --> 16:31.199
-Uh, I think that would be…
-That's-- I could-- Yes.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.826
-Yes.
-…best, yes.

16:32.909 --> 16:33.743
Very well.

16:33.827 --> 16:37.247
Shall I redon your ceremonial jewelry
and rewire your door panel?

16:37.330 --> 16:40.250
-That would be dynamite. Yeah.
-Ridic-- Yes, please.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.502
Oh! May you find harmony.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.678
Bonzo, let's not deal
with the alien invasion right now.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.471
I'm kind of in an impossible situation.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.556
I understand.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.474
To get here,
we developed interstellar flight,

16:56.558 --> 17:00.979
defeated space squids,
traversed a carnivorous black hole, twice.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.065
Uh, okay, not that impossible.

17:04.149 --> 17:06.359
Because of you,
I can't get into Mountain College.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.194
The recruiter quit,
and zombies can't apply.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.738
-Zah.
-Hmm.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.575
Mountain College. Downloading.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.244
What are they doing?

17:23.043 --> 17:24.336
Too bad you are not exceptional.

17:25.253 --> 17:28.923
The only way for you to get in
is to prove that you are exceptional.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.842
Mountain College
has a separate application

17:30.925 --> 17:32.427
for an exceptional-student scholarship

17:32.510 --> 17:34.679
and it does not
specifically prohibit zombies.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.185
Yeah.
That sounds exactly like me.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.356
Perhaps exceptional
means something else in this galaxy.

17:44.439 --> 17:49.194
Ah, okay, you know what?
Believe me, I'm impressive. Kay?

17:49.861 --> 17:51.571
Meh. I do not see it.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.158
Whatever. I am going to get
that scholarship to Mountain College

17:55.241 --> 17:58.495
and knock down the door
to higher education for all monsters.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.163
Yeah.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.421
-Why are you so agitated?

18:09.089 --> 18:11.049
Oh, we are not agitated. We are happy.

18:11.132 --> 18:14.719
You found a loophole.
A way this zombie can get into college.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.221
Come on.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.056
All right.

18:18.139 --> 18:18.973
Oh.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.601
Emotions are messy for telepaths,
so we suppress them.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.104
-But they do seem interesting.

18:24.187 --> 18:25.522
You can all come on out.

18:32.779 --> 18:36.032
We have many advancements
to share with your primitive people.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.869
We even created a digestible
bacterial fermentation of lactose

18:39.953 --> 18:41.705
at sub-zero stasis.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.248
Whoa.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.291
Froyo? Yeah, we got that too.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.376
Impressive.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.754
If you're here to invade Seabrook,
our pack won't go down without a fight.

18:49.838 --> 18:52.882
We do not want your one-star planet.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.926
They are so emotional.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.472
Yes, but when in Seabrook,

19:00.056 --> 19:02.308
I'm going to disengage
our emotional suppressors.

19:02.392 --> 19:05.020
Personally, I'm excited
to see what emotions feel like.

19:07.814 --> 19:11.651
Excited! That's an emotion.
It feels so exciting.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.238
We've decided to let you stay
until after the cheer competition,

19:15.321 --> 19:16.740
but not a day later.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.702
Thank you, Mayor. We are honored
to join your cheer competition.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.912
What is cheer?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.540
Oh, don't worry. I'll show you later.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.083
Also, what is competition?

19:27.167 --> 19:29.878
When you challenge others
to prove you're the best.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.963
No, we are a harmonious people.

19:32.047 --> 19:34.174
We do not compete amongst ourselves.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.844
Although, that is an intriguing concept,
is it not?

19:38.428 --> 19:42.390
Hi, I'm Zed. Zombie, football star.
Generally well-liked.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.684
Well, I am A-lan. Extraterrestrial.

19:44.768 --> 19:47.937
Hey, the haters say
I'm a little extra too.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.732
-Oh, competition.
-No, it's just a handshake.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.153
Okay.

19:57.405 --> 20:00.158
-Did I win?
-No, you did not win.

20:00.909 --> 20:04.704
Apologies.
Our people have a special stardust spark.

20:04.788 --> 20:07.582
That some lesser species may find painful.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.545
Welcome to Seabrook.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.880
-Hmm.
-Hi.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.685
A-lan,
did you remember your midday rations?

20:26.768 --> 20:27.769
Yes, Mothership.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.897
A-li, did you remember
your thermal overgarment?

20:30.980 --> 20:32.565
Yes, Mothership.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.776
And, A-spen, don't forget your mission

20:34.859 --> 20:37.946
to find the interstellar map
to our new home planet.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.989
Mothership. Shh. Secret mission.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.410
Okay. No need to
bite your mothership's head off.

20:46.287 --> 20:50.041
I hope you take this opportunity
to learn from our advanced intelligence.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.796
Uh, you have to pull.

20:54.879 --> 20:55.880
Yeah.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.758
There you go.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.272
Yo.

21:12.355 --> 21:15.066
-Hi. Aren't the aliens amazing?

21:15.150 --> 21:17.444
They have a non-hierarchical approach
to leadership.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.279
They're a fashion-forward,
peaceful people.

21:19.362 --> 21:22.073
Okay, well,
they did kind of blow up Seabrook, right?

21:22.157 --> 21:23.783
Well, it was an accident, Zed.

21:23.867 --> 21:26.661
I mean, just imagine the courage needed
to come to a new planet.

21:26.745 --> 21:29.622
I mean, I'm just nervous
about going away to college alone.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.667
Well, not alone.

21:32.751 --> 21:34.669
-With you.
-Right.

21:34.753 --> 21:38.465

Why are they really here?

24:26.675 --> 24:28.134
Better watch your step.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.970
We will watch our step.
Thank you for the warning.

24:33.264 --> 24:34.265
Smile.

24:34.349 --> 24:36.643
-How cool, an alien camera.
-No fleas.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.523
Hmm.

24:44.901 --> 24:46.778
Whoa. What just happened?

24:56.788 --> 24:59.666
Addison, you can't help those invaders.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.209
Back off, Bucky.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.503
Your cousin's the cheer captain now.
Not you.

25:03.586 --> 25:04.838
Thanks, Willa.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.172
But Bucky is right.

25:06.923 --> 25:07.924
I'm right?

25:08.425 --> 25:10.301
Yes, of course I'm right.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.845
A little right.

25:13.263 --> 25:15.181
I don't trust the aliens, Addison.

25:15.265 --> 25:18.268
Last time outsiders swooped into Seabrook,
our moonstone was stolen.

25:18.351 --> 25:22.397
And this time, we might lose our shot
of getting into Mountain College.

25:22.480 --> 25:26.484
Which is why
we need to protect what's ours.

25:26.568 --> 25:32.741
The Seabrook Cup, my legacy.
Me, in general.

25:33.783 --> 25:37.704
Right, Willa? Or should I say, Wacey?

25:38.413 --> 25:39.622
You should not.

25:42.876 --> 25:46.921
Don't worry about the aliens.
I'm not afraid of a little competition.

25:50.175 --> 25:52.385
I have a real shot
of getting into Mountain College.

25:52.469 --> 25:56.556
I just-- I wish you were here to help me
with the exceptional student application.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.224
I am here. Turn around.

25:59.100 --> 26:02.562
I whipped up a little something
with the spare parts laying around Z-Corp.

26:02.645 --> 26:04.689
This is amazing, Eliza.

26:07.442 --> 26:11.446
No, the aliens didn't imprison me
in this robot body. I did this.

26:13.114 --> 26:14.783
Yeah, I would have made myself taller too.

26:15.825 --> 26:18.912
At least I didn't fail my driver's test,
Bonzo. Twice.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.374
Sorry, low blow. You're a genius.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.167
Uh, when's your application due?

26:24.250 --> 26:27.879
Uh, today, so not technically last-minute?

26:27.962 --> 26:29.381
Okay, let me get this straight.

26:29.464 --> 26:32.384
The only way you can get in
is as an exceptional student?

26:32.467 --> 26:33.301
Uh...

26:33.385 --> 26:35.929
Okay, hold on.
Let me pull up your transcript.

26:40.183 --> 26:43.937
Hey, check it out. I'm ranked third
in our class for grade point average.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.444
What? I'm ninth now?

26:52.028 --> 26:54.239
-No, that-- that's wrong.

26:55.657 --> 26:56.741
I'm ranked 18th?

26:56.825 --> 26:58.493
Wait, okay,
this doesn't make sense at all.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.161
All these grades ahead of me are…

27:01.287 --> 27:02.288
otherworldly.

27:03.498 --> 27:04.374
Zed.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.963
They did the entire course in 23 minutes.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.047
It only took them that long

27:11.131 --> 27:14.134
because they couldn't figure out
how to work a pencil sharpener.

27:22.434 --> 27:25.020
Look, the utensil is functional again.

27:25.937 --> 27:28.314
The aliens stole all my class rankings.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.986
-And beat my athletic records.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.320
What? Hey!

27:34.404 --> 27:38.700
Oowee, Zed,
A-lan just obliterated your best times.

27:38.783 --> 27:42.746
He ran crop circles around you.
Bench press records, blew yours away.

27:43.329 --> 27:47.459
High jump, he's a VFO.
Very Identifiable Flying Object.

27:47.542 --> 27:49.377
He has six-pack abs.

27:49.461 --> 27:52.005
I can get to eight, Coach.
Just give me time.

27:53.340 --> 27:57.218
And the best part?
The laws of gravity do not apply to them.

27:57.302 --> 27:59.471
-Whoa!

27:59.554 --> 28:01.681
I'd be happy to dunk on you, Zed.

28:02.182 --> 28:03.641
That'd be fun to see.

28:04.309 --> 28:07.270
Well, there goes your chance.
Now monsters will never get in.

28:08.271 --> 28:11.691
Yes, being better than others
is very enjoyable.

28:11.775 --> 28:15.445
Hey, aliens. You are ruining my chances
to get into Mountain College.

28:15.528 --> 28:18.823
Oh! I do not like this conflict.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.450
Cannot wait to leave this discord.

28:20.533 --> 28:23.328
Yeah, okay, so then why don't you
just go back to your own planet?

28:23.411 --> 28:25.830
Because it was destroyed.

28:26.915 --> 28:30.126
We don't have a home.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.337
-Uh...

28:32.420 --> 28:35.215
I-- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I really am.

28:35.298 --> 28:39.469
You know, as tough as things have been
for zombies, we've always had Zombietown.

28:40.136 --> 28:41.930
Is there anything I can do?

28:45.016 --> 28:46.559
You would help us?

28:49.479 --> 28:53.066
With our Luma Lenses,
we probed all the minds of Seabrook.

28:53.149 --> 28:55.193
Mind probes? Why would you do that?

28:55.860 --> 28:59.364
-To learn about cheer, obviously. Cheer.
-Cheer, obviously. Cheer.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.241
Okay, but what about people's privacy?

29:01.324 --> 29:03.451
I mean, you can't just scan people's--

29:03.535 --> 29:04.661
Hey, what is that?

29:05.328 --> 29:07.914
-Oh, your biology teacher's brain scan.
-Is that my test?

29:08.748 --> 29:11.710
A D-plus? That is-- Ouch.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.211
I could beat that easily.

29:13.294 --> 29:14.379
You were unfairly marked.

29:14.462 --> 29:17.132
Your answers correctly highlight
the purpose of brains for zombies.

29:17.215 --> 29:19.467
Your teacher
does not understand zombie culture.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.223
That's the grade you should have gotten.

29:25.306 --> 29:28.143
-Yes! Just like that? Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

29:28.226 --> 29:29.102
Mm-hmm.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.438
So there is something you can do for us.

29:33.356 --> 29:35.984
This image appears in many scans.
What is it?

29:36.067 --> 29:37.569
That is the moonstone.

29:37.652 --> 29:42.115
It is the most precious thing in Seabrook.
It's the life force for werewolves.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.950
Instrumomo.

29:44.034 --> 29:45.326
But stay away from it,

29:45.410 --> 29:48.496
because the werewolves won't
let any outsiders near the moonstone.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.792
-You are so caring.

29:52.876 --> 29:54.544
Okay, well…

29:54.627 --> 29:58.381
Zed, we shall reward your help
by improving your application.

29:58.965 --> 30:02.302
It's not rocket science,
but knowing rocket science won't hurt.

30:03.470 --> 30:05.180
What does that expression mean?

30:05.680 --> 30:10.143
It means that the universe has sent me
an intergalactic alien dream team

30:10.226 --> 30:12.103
to help get this zombie into college!

30:14.606 --> 30:15.607
Yeah. Okay.

30:17.233 --> 30:20.904
This looks really good. How'd you get
the application done so fast?

30:21.488 --> 30:24.115
I got friends in high places,
what can I say?

30:24.199 --> 30:25.950
This is huge. Zed, you did it.

30:26.451 --> 30:27.452
Oh, yeah.

30:27.535 --> 30:30.705
And all I have left is the home interview
for Mountain College.

30:30.789 --> 30:32.457
Zombie-kind is depending on you.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.501
Yeah, it's all on me.

30:35.710 --> 30:37.462
Hey, don't worry, man. I got this.

30:40.173 --> 30:41.174
Eliza, is that you?

30:41.675 --> 30:44.010
Cool, right?
You know, can't beat zombie tech.

30:44.594 --> 30:47.013
Well, I mean,
I wouldn't underestimate wolf tech.

30:47.514 --> 30:50.809
Hey, I was thinking, um,
maybe we could have like, like a,

30:50.892 --> 30:52.811
you know, remote study date or…

30:54.979 --> 30:56.272
Oops.

30:59.609 --> 31:00.652

31:23.800 --> 31:25.760
Great. Thanks, Stacey.

31:26.761 --> 31:30.098
Fear. I recognize that emotion.

31:30.181 --> 31:32.100
Oh, great leader of cheer,
I need your help.

31:32.183 --> 31:33.685
Yeah, of course.

31:33.768 --> 31:35.520
I have a feeling I cannot define.

31:35.603 --> 31:39.399
My palms are sweaty, and it feels
like space moths are in my stomach.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.151
Space flu.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.820
I think you have a crush, A-spen.

31:44.404 --> 31:45.238
Crush?

31:45.321 --> 31:50.994
No, um, it's when you like-like someone.
You know, love.

31:51.911 --> 31:52.746
I do not know.

31:53.371 --> 31:56.791
It's when you connect with someone
in a really strong way.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.252
And desire, somewhat irrationally,
to be with them?

32:00.211 --> 32:02.297
-Yes, that is it.
-Who's the lucky person?

32:02.380 --> 32:03.256
A zombie.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.216
Oh! Bonzo is so not available.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.885
Hey, hold my glasses, Addy.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.845
-I love Zed.

32:08.928 --> 32:11.014
Uh, you love Zed?

32:11.681 --> 32:17.020
Uh, A-spen, um, I love Zed.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.229
Aw. That's so cute.

32:18.313 --> 32:20.482
We both love Zed. How wonderful.

32:22.067 --> 32:24.277
Yeah, you can't like her boyfriend.

32:24.861 --> 32:26.321
One must control who they love?

32:26.404 --> 32:27.822
Mm-hmm.

32:27.906 --> 32:30.867
Uh, well, no. You can't control love.

32:30.950 --> 32:35.622
But Zed and I are a couple,
and we wanna be together for…

32:35.705 --> 32:37.040
Forever?

32:37.916 --> 32:41.795
Well, if he gets into Mountain College
then, yeah, forever.

32:43.797 --> 32:45.799
Or maybe he will not get in,
change his mind,

32:45.882 --> 32:47.175
and love me when you go away.

32:48.343 --> 32:49.594
Uh...

32:50.595 --> 32:53.056
Yeah, um,
let's talk about this after practice.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.517
Practice. Sounds fun.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.644
Yeah, and we'll show you
why the Mighty Shrimp

32:57.727 --> 32:59.729
are the best cheerleaders in the galaxy.

33:06.736 --> 33:07.737

33:25.213 --> 33:27.048

34:00.331 --> 34:03.668
Our telepathic groupthink
makes cheer so easy.

34:03.752 --> 34:07.088
Yes. We are even better than you,
and you've practiced your whole life.

34:07.172 --> 34:09.215
-Huh?

34:09.299 --> 34:12.093
So fun. Thank you for inviting us.

34:18.808 --> 34:21.770
Hey, it's us against them,
and we are going to win.

34:21.853 --> 34:23.396
We're not gonna let them take what's ours.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.106
Like the Seabrook Cup.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.608
Right, the Seabrook Cup.

34:27.192 --> 34:28.902
Go, Seabrook!

34:28.985 --> 34:30.653
-Yes. That's the spirit.

34:30.737 --> 34:34.324
See? Your squad just needed
a common enemy to motivate you.

34:34.407 --> 34:35.408
No.

34:37.035 --> 34:40.080
We are going to win
because this squad loves each other,

34:40.163 --> 34:41.998
not because we hate anyone else.

34:42.082 --> 34:43.333
It's not who we are.

34:43.416 --> 34:45.960
This Cheer Off is our last chance
to cheer together,

34:46.044 --> 34:50.632
and to win it, we have to try
a triple hip-hop double tuck Lindy.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.509
That move's impossible.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.594
I can't do that move
without face-planting.

34:54.678 --> 34:56.971
-His face cannot take another nose job.

34:57.055 --> 35:00.975
Together, we can do anything.
Come on, guys. Let's go.

35:04.229 --> 35:05.980
Now that they're distracted,

35:06.064 --> 35:08.233
-we can vaporize them.
-See the moonstone.

35:08.733 --> 35:10.652
Don't look at me like that.

35:10.735 --> 35:12.946
A-li, we are a peaceful people.

35:13.697 --> 35:16.199
Right, sorry.
These emotions are getting to me.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.827
Oh, me too.
The joy of competition has consumed me,

35:18.910 --> 35:21.287
and, unfortunately,
I am just so good at winning.

35:22.247 --> 35:24.457
We must remember, we are one people.

35:24.541 --> 35:27.002
-United.
-Without disagreement.

35:27.085 --> 35:29.337
And we need to find the moonstone.

35:44.978 --> 35:47.147
Now they'll never know we were here.

35:51.985 --> 35:55.905
There's a force field around it,
which I most definitely saw.

36:01.369 --> 36:04.205
-Not anymore.
-Most impressive.

36:04.289 --> 36:06.708
Yes, the moonstone's crystal formation

36:06.791 --> 36:09.586
would have the processing power
to hold our map's coordinates.

36:09.669 --> 36:12.213
I meant their frozen yogurt's impressive.

36:14.007 --> 36:14.883
Sorry.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.677
The scan's complete.
And the coordinates are…

36:19.137 --> 36:20.388
Not hidden here.

36:21.097 --> 36:22.432
Mission failure.

36:28.688 --> 36:29.814
Didn't hurt that bad.

36:31.024 --> 36:32.275
Owie-momo…

36:33.568 --> 36:36.321
This stone interferes with our stardust.
It's very powerful.

36:36.404 --> 36:38.573
Someone's coming.
Mothership, beam us up, now.

36:38.656 --> 36:41.659
"Mothership, beam us up, do our laundry,

36:41.743 --> 36:44.412
calculate
the trans-temporal quantum jump."

36:44.496 --> 36:47.707
You'll stay down there
until you learn some manners.

36:47.791 --> 36:49.459
-Too late. Everyone hide.

36:57.050 --> 36:58.885
Someone's been trespassing on our turf.

37:01.304 --> 37:03.348
Someone's taken down our force field.

37:05.058 --> 37:09.396
And someone's been eating our Froyo.
And it's all melted.

Well, since you said please.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.715
Uh, hello? You're welcome.

40:24.841 --> 40:26.593
Way to bring it, everybody.

40:26.676 --> 40:28.094
Uh...

40:28.178 --> 40:29.179
Help!

40:30.805 --> 40:31.973
Help!

40:34.225 --> 40:35.602
What is going on?

40:38.355 --> 40:39.356
Whoa.

40:57.082 --> 40:58.500
Ha, missed me--

40:58.583 --> 41:01.419
-Sorry, reflexes. Zed!

41:02.003 --> 41:03.213
What are you doing here?

41:03.296 --> 41:04.881
I got beamed up. What are you doing here?

41:04.964 --> 41:07.300
A-spen asked if I could help
with my knowledge of Seabrook.

41:07.384 --> 41:08.468
Aw...

41:08.551 --> 41:11.471
Poor thing. They're trying
to spend alone time with you.

41:11.554 --> 41:13.223
Alone time? Why?

41:13.306 --> 41:14.557
Oh! Oh.

41:14.641 --> 41:17.477
Okay, well, I do have universal appeal.

41:17.560 --> 41:21.022
Hey, be nice. A-spen's new to feelings
and human relations.

41:21.106 --> 41:22.774
Beware. Intruder.

41:22.857 --> 41:23.858
Addison?

41:25.652 --> 41:27.737
Mothership beamed you aboard?

41:28.488 --> 41:29.406
Mm-hmm.

41:29.489 --> 41:30.782
We have no choice but to--

41:30.865 --> 41:32.242
-Vaporize you.
-Welcome you.

41:34.244 --> 41:35.328
-A-li.
-Oh!

41:35.412 --> 41:37.330
Right. Welcome you.

41:40.458 --> 41:41.459
Sorry.

41:48.049 --> 41:49.801
This is Scout Commander--

41:51.428 --> 41:52.887
You have a wonderful home.

41:52.971 --> 41:54.389
I proudly report my mission--

41:54.472 --> 41:58.226
It is a marvelous ship,
but it is not our home.

41:58.309 --> 42:00.645
Our planet was destroyed
by environmental blight

42:00.729 --> 42:02.022
built up over many years.

42:02.105 --> 42:05.942
What? Over years?
Didn't anyone try to stop it?

42:06.026 --> 42:09.863
No. And we lost everything.
No one spoke up.

42:11.072 --> 42:13.950
That would have led to disagreements.
We value harmony.

42:14.034 --> 42:18.496
And we will remain one people
in harmony at any cost.

42:18.580 --> 42:19.998
You seem angry.

42:20.081 --> 42:25.045
I'm not angry. I'm just
in harmony in a super hostile way.

42:25.128 --> 42:27.130
I need to get off this planet.

42:29.090 --> 42:31.134
We need your help. But first…

42:31.217 --> 42:32.886
A-spen has great feelings for you.

42:32.969 --> 42:34.679
Ah, right. About that.

42:34.763 --> 42:38.058
I've been doing research, Zed.
Couples can grow apart.

42:38.141 --> 42:39.559
But we are not a couple.

42:39.642 --> 42:41.019
No, we are not.

42:41.102 --> 42:44.064
I am breaking up with you. I am sorry.

42:44.147 --> 42:47.817
We do not have tissues aboard,
but you can use my sleeve if you must cry.

42:47.901 --> 42:49.069
What?

42:49.152 --> 42:50.737
We'll always have the invasion.

42:53.031 --> 42:55.950
As you can see, they have mastered
the interactions of your species

42:56.034 --> 42:57.452
and feels you can both be trusted.

42:58.703 --> 43:02.749
Years ago, our scout crashed in Seabrook
and hid a map to Utopia.

43:02.832 --> 43:04.334
A new home for aliens.

43:04.959 --> 43:06.461
We came here to find it.

43:06.544 --> 43:09.172
Wait, I thought you said
you were here for cheer.

43:10.423 --> 43:12.300
That was a deception.

43:12.384 --> 43:15.387
We were afraid
you would not allow us to find the map

43:15.470 --> 43:17.555
since it's hidden
in the most precious thing in Seabrook.

43:17.639 --> 43:20.058
So that's why
you kept asking about the moonstone.

43:20.141 --> 43:23.395
Yes. But our scans came back negative.
It's not there.

43:24.020 --> 43:25.563
What else is precious in Seabrook?

43:26.731 --> 43:28.525
Well, cheer, mostly.

43:28.608 --> 43:30.276
But you can't hide coordinates
in a routine.

43:30.360 --> 43:31.820
This is Scout Commander--

43:31.903 --> 43:35.907
Do not touch. We're repairing the files
of our scout's logs.

43:35.990 --> 43:37.534
With no success.

43:38.034 --> 43:39.703
I mean, have you guys tried banging it?

43:39.786 --> 43:42.247
It works whenever
my old TV's on the fritz.

43:42.330 --> 43:45.834
Banging?
That's highly sensitive cosmic tech.

43:45.917 --> 43:47.669
-You can't just bang it.
-Ouch!

43:49.546 --> 43:51.423
Oh. That seems to have worked.

43:52.382 --> 43:53.883
Playing Scout's log.

43:53.967 --> 43:57.512
This is Scout Commander 15-09.

43:57.595 --> 44:00.890
I proudly report my mission is complete.

44:00.974 --> 44:04.978
For centuries, we have been
without a home, but I found utopia.

44:05.061 --> 44:07.605
The perfect new planet for our people.

44:07.689 --> 44:11.985
I hid the coordinates
in the most precious thing in Seabrook.

44:12.068 --> 44:15.572
You must find the most precious thing
in Seabrook.

44:15.655 --> 44:20.618
Many decades ago, out of fuel,
my scout ship crashed on this planet.

44:20.702 --> 44:25.373
I would have died
if not for a young humanoid, Eli.

44:25.457 --> 44:28.501
He hid me and nursed me to health.

44:29.002 --> 44:34.382
But with no ship to take me home,
I was forced to hide my true identity.

44:34.466 --> 44:35.925
I know how that feels.

44:36.551 --> 44:42.682
I joined Eli in his school,
and I discovered my passion: Cheerleading.

44:43.266 --> 44:45.352
I even created a trophy.

44:47.270 --> 44:48.563
The Seabrook Cup.

44:48.646 --> 44:54.444
But no longer in contact with our people,
my hair grew white,

44:54.527 --> 44:57.197
and I lost my stardust powers.

44:58.198 --> 45:00.075
Though I gained something else.

45:00.867 --> 45:02.035
A family.

45:02.118 --> 45:04.454
Eli and I fell in love and married,

45:04.537 --> 45:09.918
and we named our firstborn A-Mishanta,
but we always called her Missy.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.129
That's my mom's name.

45:19.219 --> 45:20.220
Grandma?

45:24.849 --> 45:27.310
The alien scout was your grandma!

45:27.394 --> 45:31.606
My grandma. Grandma Angie was an alien?
My mom's an alien?

45:31.690 --> 45:35.443
You're part alien.
That's why the ship beamed you up too.

45:35.527 --> 45:37.112
Zed, I know who I am!

45:42.033 --> 45:43.660
We have too much history, Zed.

45:44.369 --> 45:45.578
Okay.

45:50.500 --> 45:54.254
We found this Luma Lens on the scout ship.
It belonged to your grandmother.

46:02.470 --> 46:04.848
Now do you possess our spark?

46:04.931 --> 46:07.100
Can you lift the Luma Lens?

46:14.149 --> 46:16.443
Uh, I-- I can't.

46:21.573 --> 46:26.161
Our relationship with stardust defines us.
Our technology would not work for you.

46:26.244 --> 46:28.371
You cannot share in our telepathy.

46:29.122 --> 46:31.332
Nor survive travel with us.

46:32.375 --> 46:34.586
No, no, this is who I am.

46:34.669 --> 46:36.588
This is where I belong.
It all makes sense.

46:36.671 --> 46:39.674
I'm sorry. You do not have our spark.

46:40.300 --> 46:41.760
You are not truly one of us.

46:44.387 --> 46:46.890
Right. Yeah. Sorry.

46:47.474 --> 46:48.558
-Addison.

46:52.479 --> 46:55.148
I feel deep sorrow.

47:00.111 --> 47:04.616
Wait. The scout's trophy
contains materials from our planet.

47:05.116 --> 47:09.412
What could be more precious
than an artifact from our home world?

47:10.997 --> 47:14.000
The map is there. We must win that trophy.

47:21.883 --> 47:23.593
The aliens won't accept me?

47:23.677 --> 47:26.179
I may be part alien,
but I'm still totally alone.

47:26.262 --> 47:29.766
Addison, because of you,
no one in Seabrook ever has to feel alone.

47:31.267 --> 47:33.603
You made this a place
for people to call home.

47:39.901 --> 47:42.320
I'll still help the aliens find the map
to their new home.

47:42.821 --> 47:44.656
Good. And whatever happens,

47:44.739 --> 47:47.242
you have to go to Mountain College
whether I get in or not.

47:49.202 --> 47:51.913
It doesn't matter
how far away we are from each other.

47:51.996 --> 47:53.373
We will always be together.

47:57.585 --> 47:59.838
You'll do great
on your interview tomorrow.

48:00.964 --> 48:04.342
I better. Everyone's counting on me
to be the first zombie to go to college.

48:04.926 --> 48:06.136
You're not alone either, Zed.

48:09.973 --> 48:10.974
Come on.

48:26.489 --> 48:28.324
Where did you hide the map, Grandma?

48:42.839 --> 48:45.383
Mom, where was Grandma Angie from?

48:46.634 --> 48:50.138
Seabrook, dear. Born and raised.

48:50.972 --> 48:51.973
Why?

48:52.474 --> 48:54.351
Because, uh...

48:55.310 --> 48:56.311
Never mind.

48:58.521 --> 48:59.939
-Good night.
-Night.

49:06.154 --> 49:08.156
-Attention, everyone.

49:08.239 --> 49:10.408
If Zed can prove
that monsters are exceptional,

49:10.492 --> 49:12.243
doors will open for all of us.

49:12.327 --> 49:14.162
You're gonna ace your driver's test,
zom-boo.

49:14.245 --> 49:16.289
But right now, focus. Zed needs us.

49:16.873 --> 49:18.958
All right, everybody. Listen up.
We only get one shot.

49:19.042 --> 49:21.628
Zed's interviewer, Mrs. Crabtree,
is gonna be here in an hour.

49:23.880 --> 49:25.423
Who's early?

49:26.758 --> 49:27.759
Uh-oh.

49:29.052 --> 49:30.637
Seabrook, we have a problem.

49:30.720 --> 49:33.098
You're making history today, Zed.

49:33.181 --> 49:35.809
First zombie
to even interview for college.

49:35.892 --> 49:37.644
Hey, you show 'em what monsters can do.

49:37.727 --> 49:40.480
Right. I am going to slay her
with my killer zombie charm.

49:40.563 --> 49:41.648
Yeah.

49:41.731 --> 49:44.109
Or not. Probably not. I don't know.
We will see.

52:38.742 --> 52:39.743
Thank you.

-Progress for you is progress for us all.

52:43.413 --> 52:47.334
Why don't you join us to start?
I understand you've already been accepted.

52:47.834 --> 52:49.419
-Good job, Zed!
-Let's go inside!

52:52.756 --> 52:55.508
We found your application persuasive.

52:55.592 --> 52:58.803
Well, I'm just doing my zom-best.
Zombie best.

52:59.304 --> 53:03.641
Uh, our biggest concern is that you could
turn into a monster at any time.

53:03.725 --> 53:06.603
Yes. I am a monster, but completely safe.

53:06.686 --> 53:09.606
Zombies eating brains?
Thing of the past.

53:09.689 --> 53:11.608
Zed can control his "zombie-ing" out.

53:13.360 --> 53:15.195
Look at that! We have electricity.

53:15.278 --> 53:17.447
I must have rubbed my foot on the carpet.

53:17.530 --> 53:22.285
Despite being a zombie, how would you
positively impact Mountain College?

53:22.369 --> 53:23.411
Despite?

53:23.495 --> 53:25.163
Uh, that is a fair question.

53:25.246 --> 53:28.041
Um, you know,
I think what I bring to the table is the--

53:29.793 --> 53:30.794
You okay there?

53:30.877 --> 53:34.547
Yeah! No. I'm great.
Just give me a second to--

53:34.631 --> 53:37.258
I just need to use
the restroom real quick.

53:37.884 --> 53:38.885
That's the kitchen.

53:42.138 --> 53:44.766
-What happened?
-I don't know. I just lost control.

53:47.143 --> 53:48.228
It's coming from me!

53:48.311 --> 53:50.146
Not now! I gotta focus!

53:52.107 --> 53:53.983
I'm so sorry!

53:54.067 --> 53:57.237
Uh, zombie delicacy?
They're made with real fish guts.

53:58.029 --> 54:01.282
Wait, it's your powers! Your alien powers!

54:01.366 --> 54:04.494
I have their spark!
It must have taken longer to affect me!

54:04.577 --> 54:06.871
Addison Rosalind Wells! You are an alien!

54:06.955 --> 54:07.872
I am!

54:11.751 --> 54:13.420
Is everything all right in there?

54:13.503 --> 54:14.713
Yes! We're fine!

54:15.296 --> 54:17.507
I can't wait to tell the aliens
at the Cheer Off tomorrow.

54:17.590 --> 54:19.134
My mom's gonna freak out. She has no idea.

54:19.217 --> 54:20.260
-She's gonna--
-Please stop!

54:20.343 --> 54:22.345
-I'm sorry! I'm trying. I really am.

54:30.270 --> 54:31.438
Zombie!

54:31.521 --> 54:32.897
No, no. No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

54:34.774 --> 54:35.859
I'm so sorry!

54:35.942 --> 54:36.943
Don't be.

54:39.571 --> 54:41.489
Wait! Please.

55:47.430 --> 55:49.849
The Seabrook Cup. Of course!

55:49.933 --> 55:52.602
That must be where
my grandma hid the map to utopia!

55:53.978 --> 55:56.356
The aliens have to win it or I do.

55:57.899 --> 56:00.985
Oh, yes. She is beautiful.

56:02.153 --> 56:07.450
Too bad you'll be way too nervous
to win her when the pressure is on!

56:07.534 --> 56:09.452
I look forward to being nervous.

56:10.495 --> 56:12.706
Eat my stardust, Seabrook.

56:14.124 --> 56:16.334
Did I correctly talk trash?

56:23.633 --> 56:25.635
Farewell sweet bling.

56:27.345 --> 56:28.179
Ooh!

56:29.931 --> 56:31.891
What do we have here?

56:33.852 --> 56:35.687
What do we have here?

56:37.313 --> 56:39.274
What do we have here?

56:40.567 --> 56:42.402
What do we have here?

56:43.403 --> 56:45.321
What do we have here?

56:46.823 --> 56:48.950
What do we have here?

56:50.452 --> 56:53.580
It's been an exciting evening
here at the National Cheer Off.

56:54.164 --> 56:56.458
We discovered alien life this week,

56:56.541 --> 56:58.585
-but the big question in the universe…
-Let's go!

56:58.668 --> 57:01.546
…is who will win the Seabrook Cheer Cup?

57:01.629 --> 57:04.299
-Yeah! Okay!

57:11.765 --> 57:14.601
Oh,
the Eastside Eels are really bringing it!

57:15.810 --> 57:19.189
Now, remember.
This priceless thingy is mine!

57:19.272 --> 57:23.109
So tell me what it is! Now! Now! Now!

57:23.193 --> 57:27.113
So catty. Clearly not raised by wolves.

57:27.822 --> 57:30.450
I bet I'm the first intern
to ever hack alien tech.

57:30.533 --> 57:32.202


57:32.952 --> 57:33.953
It's a firewall.

57:34.037 --> 57:35.455
Let me try my moonstone.

57:38.750 --> 57:41.002
It worked. It's a mind probe.

57:41.086 --> 57:42.003


57:42.087 --> 57:43.088
Uh...

57:44.964 --> 57:46.841
Bloodthirsty monsters. Always winning!

57:46.925 --> 57:48.760
Look at all those people thinking of me!

57:50.261 --> 57:52.180
That's just your mind scan, Bucky.

57:52.263 --> 57:53.682


57:53.765 --> 57:56.768


57:56.851 --> 57:58.853
Aw, Wynter. You like cat videos.

57:58.937 --> 58:00.480
Everyone likes kittens.

58:02.649 --> 58:04.818


58:04.901 --> 58:05.902
We'd be honored.

58:09.572 --> 58:14.369
Wyatt? Why does your mind probe
have so many memories of me?

58:15.870 --> 58:17.205
You have a crush on me?

58:18.915 --> 58:19.833
Uh...

58:19.916 --> 58:21.001
I, uh…

58:23.837 --> 58:25.171
Enough with this mushy stuff!

58:25.255 --> 58:27.298
Find out what the aliens are up to.

58:28.925 --> 58:30.468


58:30.552 --> 58:32.262
This is Scout Commander.

58:32.345 --> 58:35.473
You must find the most precious thing
in Seabrook.

58:35.557 --> 58:38.351
-The aliens lied about their mission!
-What?

58:38.435 --> 58:40.311
We knew they were shady all along.

58:40.395 --> 58:42.439
Who knows what else
they're lying to us about?

58:42.939 --> 58:44.566
Bucky, alert the Z-Patrol.

58:44.649 --> 58:47.569
Help! Help! Z-Patrol! We need help!

58:53.408 --> 58:57.370
The Eels look eel-ectric as they try to
slither their way to victory.

58:57.454 --> 58:59.164
And that excites me.

58:59.247 --> 59:00.290
Me too.

59:00.915 --> 59:02.167
Me three.

59:07.088 --> 59:09.174
-Whoo!

59:12.344 --> 59:14.721
Hello, this is Zed Necrodopolis.

59:15.889 --> 59:17.849
-Yes? I gotta take this. I love you.
-Okay.

59:19.017 --> 59:22.020
Yes. This is he.
This is I. This is Zed Necrodopolis.

59:24.647 --> 59:25.732
Really?

59:28.360 --> 59:29.611
Okay.

59:29.694 --> 59:33.239
Wow! All right. Well, thank you so much.
All right. Bye-bye.

59:33.323 --> 59:36.618
I just got accepted into Mountain College!

59:36.701 --> 59:38.953
They're even inviting
other monsters to apply.

59:39.037 --> 59:41.539
We are breaking down barriers, people.

59:41.623 --> 59:43.458
-I've gotta tell Addison.

59:45.627 --> 59:50.006
Seal the cheer pavilion perimeter.
If aliens are here, we'll root 'em out.

59:50.090 --> 59:51.299
Move it!

59:54.260 --> 59:55.428
I gotta warn the aliens.

1:00:03.269 --> 1:00:04.688
Whoo!

1:00:04.771 --> 1:00:09.192
Up next,
a team not afraid to get astrophysical.

1:00:09.275 --> 1:00:13.697
From out of this world,
give it up for the aliens!

1:00:15.198 --> 1:00:17.409
-Stop! Do not go out there!

1:00:17.492 --> 1:00:20.620
But we need to win the cheer cup!
Our future depends on it.

1:00:20.704 --> 1:00:22.247
And winning tastes so good, Zed.

1:00:22.330 --> 1:00:24.874
Z-Patrol is looking for you.
They are not gonna let you compete.

1:00:24.958 --> 1:00:28.128
But without our map, we'll forever wander
the galaxy without a home.

1:00:28.712 --> 1:00:31.798
Well, you better hope Addison
sticks her landing and wins it for ya.

1:00:35.927 --> 1:00:36.970
Let's go!

1:00:41.433 --> 1:00:46.271
Our extra-talented extraterrestrials
are not taking the stage.

1:00:57.741 --> 1:01:01.995
And on this planet,
that means the aliens are disqualified.

1:01:03.079 --> 1:01:04.581
They're disqualified?

1:01:04.664 --> 1:01:06.624
Now it's up to me to get the map!

1:01:06.708 --> 1:01:09.836
So instead, next up is our final team,

1:01:09.919 --> 1:01:13.089
-Seabrook's Mighty Shrimp!

1:01:13.173 --> 1:01:14.174
Addison!

1:01:14.674 --> 1:01:16.259
We have to win the Seabrook Cup!

1:01:16.343 --> 1:01:18.553
The people I care about
are counting on it.

1:01:18.636 --> 1:01:22.140
We will win, Addy.

1:04:59.691 --> 1:05:00.775
Wow!

1:05:02.819 --> 1:05:04.279
Thank you!

1:05:09.617 --> 1:05:12.245
Yes! Yes! Yes! We did it!

1:05:12.328 --> 1:05:16.666
-We did it!
-Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1:05:16.750 --> 1:05:17.667
Whoo!

1:05:18.376 --> 1:05:20.879
The aliens are liars.
They've come to take what's ours!

1:05:20.962 --> 1:05:24.299
We should have never let Addison
welcome in those outsiders.

1:05:26.384 --> 1:05:28.261
-Step back, Zed.

1:05:28.345 --> 1:05:31.139
-So much passion.
-Uh...

1:05:31.222 --> 1:05:34.601
-She wants to rip your heart out.
-She can have it.

1:05:36.061 --> 1:05:37.979
Give me it, Addison! You won it.

1:05:38.063 --> 1:05:39.272
-It's mine!
-No!

1:05:39.356 --> 1:05:40.190
Oh!

1:05:41.524 --> 1:05:43.068
She's stealing the Seabrook Cup!

1:05:43.818 --> 1:05:45.111
Go, go, go, go!

1:05:46.363 --> 1:05:48.198
Why is Addison helping those thieves?

1:05:48.281 --> 1:05:49.532
She's a traitor!

1:05:49.616 --> 1:05:50.700
Go!

1:05:51.284 --> 1:05:52.285
Move!

1:05:54.996 --> 1:05:57.248
Freeze! Stay where you are!

1:05:58.792 --> 1:06:00.627
Beam us up, Mothership! Now!

1:06:01.670 --> 1:06:02.837
Wolves, attack!

1:06:02.921 --> 1:06:04.047
-Use our moonstones!
-No!

1:06:11.012 --> 1:06:12.430
Something's wrong.

1:06:12.514 --> 1:06:14.307
Critical systems failure.

1:06:18.895 --> 1:06:20.980
-Get 'em!
-Get those aliens! Get 'em!

1:06:21.064 --> 1:06:22.190
Get off our planet!

1:06:30.990 --> 1:06:32.283
Enough!

1:06:32.992 --> 1:06:34.077
Whoa!

1:06:34.661 --> 1:06:36.454
You zombied out! You good?

1:06:37.038 --> 1:06:40.417
Yeah! I don't know what you're up to,
big brother, but I got your back.

1:06:41.251 --> 1:06:43.336
Yes! Enough!
This is your fault too, Addison.

1:06:43.420 --> 1:06:45.755
You let these aliens in,
and they lied to us.

1:06:45.839 --> 1:06:47.549
They betrayed us. You betrayed us!

1:06:47.632 --> 1:06:49.759
-So you're either with us, or--
-With them?

1:06:50.385 --> 1:06:51.845
But I am them, Willa.

1:06:52.887 --> 1:06:55.056
I may be from Seabrook,
but my grandma wasn't.

1:06:57.100 --> 1:06:58.184
I am…

1:07:02.147 --> 1:07:03.398
an alien!

1:07:03.481 --> 1:07:04.983
-What?
-What?

1:07:06.776 --> 1:07:08.069
-No way!
-No way!

1:07:20.790 --> 1:07:22.500
-Wow!

1:07:25.295 --> 1:07:27.297
Addison is one of us!

1:07:27.380 --> 1:07:29.466
And she's amazing!

1:07:30.675 --> 1:07:33.386
Mom, Grandma Angie was an alien.

1:07:33.887 --> 1:07:35.138
But that's impossible.

1:07:35.805 --> 1:07:37.349
Missy, tell her it's impossible.

1:07:37.891 --> 1:07:39.351
Dale, I'm so sorry.

1:07:43.438 --> 1:07:46.107
I know, sweetie. I've always known.

1:07:46.900 --> 1:07:47.901
You lied to me?

1:07:47.984 --> 1:07:52.655
My parents thought that hiding
was the best way to protect me. And you.

1:07:53.698 --> 1:07:56.201
Grandma always called you
her most precious thing.

1:07:56.284 --> 1:07:59.287
Wait. She said I was her what?

1:08:03.833 --> 1:08:07.253
No. No, no. The coordinates are not here.
This is not the map.

1:08:07.337 --> 1:08:10.465
That's because the map isn't a what.
It's a who.

1:08:18.431 --> 1:08:19.724
Addison is our map.

1:08:20.308 --> 1:08:23.895
-The coordinates are in her DNA.
-Instrumomo!

1:08:23.978 --> 1:08:27.565
You're the Scout's--
Your grandmother's most precious thing!

1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:30.360
Yes! We found the map!

1:08:32.737 --> 1:08:33.947
-Sorry!
-Yeah!

1:08:34.030 --> 1:08:36.199
Okay! Let's figure that out later.

1:08:36.282 --> 1:08:37.575
-Yeah.
-But this is great!

1:08:37.659 --> 1:08:40.286
Now, you guys can record your coordinates
and head back home.

1:08:40.370 --> 1:08:44.165
And Addison and I are headed
to Mountain College together! I got in.

1:08:44.249 --> 1:08:45.709
That's great, Zed!

1:08:46.751 --> 1:08:47.752
-Nah.
-Yeah.

1:08:51.089 --> 1:08:53.550
But the map to utopia is dynamic.

1:08:53.633 --> 1:08:56.928
Constantly computing new units
to guide our spaceship.

1:08:57.595 --> 1:08:59.514
It's not just some numbers.

1:08:59.597 --> 1:09:01.182
And since Addison is our map…

1:09:01.266 --> 1:09:02.642
She needs to come with us.

1:09:03.268 --> 1:09:06.229
-What?
-No. No! You cannot take Addison.

1:09:08.690 --> 1:09:10.817
These are my people, Zed.

1:09:10.900 --> 1:09:12.610
They need me to survive.

1:09:15.405 --> 1:09:18.074
When the aliens leave,
I'm going with them.

1:09:44.559 --> 1:09:47.062
This is the hardest decision
I've ever made,

1:09:47.145 --> 1:09:48.897
but I have to do what's right.

1:09:51.024 --> 1:09:55.070
Addison, there's something
I have to share with you.

1:09:55.737 --> 1:09:57.238
I should've done this years ago.

1:09:57.322 --> 1:09:59.491
I just wish I was as strong as you.

1:10:05.121 --> 1:10:06.247
You're beautiful, Mom.

1:10:06.748 --> 1:10:08.208
Oh, sweetheart.

1:10:12.504 --> 1:10:15.924
And I don't care what planet you're from.
You're my family.

1:10:16.508 --> 1:10:17.967
Oh, Dale.

1:10:21.388 --> 1:10:23.139
No. No, you can't leave, Addison.

1:10:24.015 --> 1:10:27.268
I'll mobilize the whole Z-Patrol
to stop you. Please, it's--

1:10:28.436 --> 1:10:32.107
I'm sorry, Dad.
But this is what I was meant to do.

1:10:44.244 --> 1:10:45.870
They're saying the alien ship is damaged.

1:10:45.954 --> 1:10:48.957
-It might not survive a launch.
-It's not totally our fault.

1:10:49.708 --> 1:10:51.626
We just wanted to stop them from leaving.

1:10:51.710 --> 1:10:53.294
Well, serves them right for lying to us.

1:10:53.378 --> 1:10:55.588
We also lied when we first came here
looking for the moonstone.

1:10:55.672 --> 1:10:58.967
Don't you get it? They are stealing
from us. They're taking Addison.

1:10:59.050 --> 1:11:00.927
She's choosing to go with them
to save her people.

1:11:01.011 --> 1:11:04.097
Well, I don't want her to go.

1:11:05.598 --> 1:11:06.891
No matter how far away she goes,

1:11:06.975 --> 1:11:09.185
she'll always be
a part of our pack, Willa.

1:11:24.159 --> 1:11:27.662
With the reactor damaged,
there is a 67.9% chance

1:11:27.746 --> 1:11:29.748
that we will not have enough energy
to leave orbit.

1:11:29.831 --> 1:11:32.167
We must try.
The longer we wait, the worse our odds.

1:11:32.250 --> 1:11:33.460
Okay.

1:11:34.085 --> 1:11:35.879
Think of me when you use them.

1:11:35.962 --> 1:11:37.672
They're supposed to shake, not me.

1:11:37.756 --> 1:11:39.674
Hmm. I'll miss you, bestie.

1:11:40.425 --> 1:11:43.345
Oh, I'll miss you, extra-terestie.

1:11:44.012 --> 1:11:46.556
♪ We are the Mighty Shrimp
Couldn't be prouder ♪

1:11:46.639 --> 1:11:50.185
♪ And if you can't hear us
We'll cheer a little louder ♪

1:11:55.023 --> 1:11:57.442
I don't wanna leave,
but the aliens need to find their home.

1:11:57.525 --> 1:11:58.902
Yeah. I know.

1:11:59.402 --> 1:12:03.156
-Which is why I'm coming with you!
-What?

1:12:03.239 --> 1:12:04.949
It is impossible, Zed.

1:12:05.033 --> 1:12:08.161
Only our species is capable
of space travel on the Mothership.

1:12:08.244 --> 1:12:11.414
You'd be fried
by our stardust energy in a minute.

1:12:14.250 --> 1:12:16.753
I was afraid we would be separated
by a couple hundred miles

1:12:16.836 --> 1:12:18.463
when you went to college.

1:12:18.546 --> 1:12:19.964
Now, we'll be galaxies away.

1:12:24.678 --> 1:12:26.262
Core reactor is shutting down.

1:12:26.346 --> 1:12:28.473
Emergency systems activated.

1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:31.142
We must leave now.

1:12:31.226 --> 1:12:33.770
Even with our stardust power depleted,
we must risk it.

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:42.445
Bonzo! You got your license! Show-off!

1:12:42.529 --> 1:12:44.406
My rage will not be contained!

1:12:44.489 --> 1:12:46.658
You will not stop us
from getting to utopia!

1:12:47.242 --> 1:12:50.120
We're actually here to help.

1:12:50.787 --> 1:12:54.290
You can find an infinite power source
to recharge our ship?

1:12:54.374 --> 1:12:55.750
Wolves!

1:12:56.418 --> 1:12:58.962
We'll let you borrow the moonstone.

1:12:59.963 --> 1:13:01.589
Thought you might need a jump-start.

1:13:01.673 --> 1:13:04.926
The moonstone is powerful,
but it is harmful to our people.

1:13:05.010 --> 1:13:06.761
Not if you have an adapter.

1:13:06.845 --> 1:13:09.806
We just have to filter the moonstone power
through our Z-Bands.

1:13:11.433 --> 1:13:14.102
You all would sacrifice to help us?

1:13:14.853 --> 1:13:18.231
Wolves always have each other's back,
and Addison's a part of our pack.

1:13:19.524 --> 1:13:20.567
Forever.

1:13:23.236 --> 1:13:25.321
-Wyatt?
-Yeah?

1:13:26.573 --> 1:13:27.824
I like-like you too.

1:13:30.452 --> 1:13:31.494
Awooo.

1:13:34.873 --> 1:13:38.209
-Transport us up, Mothership. All of us.
-Yeah!

1:13:45.091 --> 1:13:46.176
This way! Come on.

1:13:51.264 --> 1:13:52.265
Yeah, here.

1:14:18.375 --> 1:14:21.127
I told you wolf tech doesn't play nice.

1:14:21.211 --> 1:14:24.547
Then we're gonna need an organic conduit
between the moonstone and the Mothership.

1:14:28.009 --> 1:14:30.470
Only our people can connect
to the ship's stardust reactor.

1:14:31.054 --> 1:14:34.015
But unfortunately,
the moonstone's power is lethal to us.

1:14:34.724 --> 1:14:36.851
But your being half human might just work.

1:14:37.811 --> 1:14:38.978
You'll be a living bridge.

1:14:39.062 --> 1:14:40.605
Addison can do it.

1:14:40.689 --> 1:14:41.773
Yes, she's an alien.

1:14:42.357 --> 1:14:43.358
And a cheerleader.

1:14:43.441 --> 1:14:44.734
And a part of our pack.

1:14:47.654 --> 1:14:48.905
You were born for this.

1:14:52.242 --> 1:14:53.368
Ready?

1:15:18.810 --> 1:15:21.521
I couldn't hold on! It's too much power!

1:15:21.604 --> 1:15:24.190
We must reestablish the connection now,
or all is lost.

1:15:26.234 --> 1:15:28.236
Take my hand.
The power can flow through me.

1:15:28.319 --> 1:15:30.905
-You'll be fried in a minute!
-It's gonna be okay.

1:15:48.506 --> 1:15:49.549
I'm so sorry!

1:16:03.521 --> 1:16:04.689
Yes!

1:16:06.900 --> 1:16:08.735
-We're at full charge!
-Yeah!

1:16:08.818 --> 1:16:10.320
Mama's back.

1:16:10.403 --> 1:16:12.489
-Yeah.
-We did it!

1:16:12.572 --> 1:16:13.740
We must launch now!

1:16:14.366 --> 1:16:16.868
All right, preparing to take off.

1:16:17.994 --> 1:16:19.120
It doesn't hurt anymore!

1:16:19.204 --> 1:16:20.747
I think I'm learning to control my powers.

1:16:23.166 --> 1:16:25.293
Launch sequence. Go.

1:16:40.308 --> 1:16:41.601
I love you, Zed.

1:16:41.685 --> 1:16:42.936
I love you too.

1:16:44.521 --> 1:16:46.231
To the end of the universe.

1:16:46.314 --> 1:16:49.818
Maybe we'll meet again somehow.

1:16:50.568 --> 1:16:51.695
Someday.

1:16:58.868 --> 1:17:03.373
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

1:17:03.873 --> 1:17:10.714
six, five, four, three, two, one.

1:17:35.488 --> 1:17:36.489

Attention, earthlings.
This is your principal speaking.

1:19:32.230 --> 1:19:33.273
Addison may be gone,

1:19:33.356 --> 1:19:37.110
but today is a chance for the rest of us
to reach for the stars

1:19:37.193 --> 1:19:40.905
as we throw our caps
in the air at graduation this afternoon.

1:19:40.989 --> 1:19:43.908
There we go. Perfect.

1:19:45.994 --> 1:19:47.412
I am so proud of you, son.

1:19:48.163 --> 1:19:49.914
-Thanks, Dad.

1:19:49.998 --> 1:19:52.208
I know. I miss her too.

1:19:59.132 --> 1:20:00.300
You'll be okay.

1:20:08.725 --> 1:20:09.726
Well, well, well.

1:20:09.809 --> 1:20:12.437
If it isn't
our robot zombie valedictorian.

1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:14.147
So much for overthrowing the system.

1:20:14.230 --> 1:20:17.984
I'm still gonna do that. From the inside.

1:20:20.987 --> 1:20:24.866
Yeah, I remember being
so scared of all of you when we first met.

1:20:24.949 --> 1:20:26.368
And we were afraid of them.

1:20:26.451 --> 1:20:28.328
That fear went away
when we got to know each other.

1:20:28.411 --> 1:20:30.288
All because of Addison.

1:20:30.372 --> 1:20:31.998
She was the first person to really see me.

1:20:32.082 --> 1:20:33.208
And me.

1:20:34.668 --> 1:20:35.710
All of us.

1:20:38.963 --> 1:20:39.964
Come on.

1:20:47.722 --> 1:20:50.642
Mothership's almost calculated
the coordinates to utopia.

1:20:51.309 --> 1:20:54.604
She's having trouble extracting
the coordinates from Addison's DNA.

1:20:55.105 --> 1:20:57.899
We've been stuck at 97% complete
for a while.

1:20:58.566 --> 1:21:00.944
Oh, come on, Mothership!

1:21:04.364 --> 1:21:06.074
Awooo.

1:21:10.370 --> 1:21:13.331
That did it. Only a few more minutes now.

1:21:15.291 --> 1:21:16.292
I've been thinking.

1:21:16.376 --> 1:21:19.337
Why didn't your grandmother just tell us
that you were the map?

1:21:19.421 --> 1:21:21.006
Why make our search so difficult?

1:21:21.589 --> 1:21:23.174
Maybe she thought there was
something to learn

1:21:23.258 --> 1:21:25.176
by staying in Seabrook for a while.

1:21:27.595 --> 1:21:29.556
Accessing mind probes.

1:21:32.308 --> 1:21:33.768
I think there's something there, you know?

1:21:33.852 --> 1:21:36.896
Look, humans are bad,
but cheerleaders are monsters.

1:21:48.033 --> 1:21:49.367
Wolves!

1:21:52.454 --> 1:21:55.874
I will miss your friends,
but not the discord in your people.

1:21:55.957 --> 1:21:58.335
In utopia, we will never have conflict.

1:22:01.046 --> 1:22:03.173
But sometimes you need conflict.

1:22:03.256 --> 1:22:04.257
Need it?

1:22:04.341 --> 1:22:06.926
Look what happened
once we overcame our differences.

1:22:10.263 --> 1:22:11.598
You became friends.

1:22:12.098 --> 1:22:13.475
We did.

1:22:13.558 --> 1:22:15.977
Together, we made progress.

1:22:20.023 --> 1:22:21.775
Conflict isn't always bad.

1:22:22.359 --> 1:22:24.569
Being challenged
sometimes pushes us to be better.

1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:28.698
This is true.

1:22:29.407 --> 1:22:31.743
No one spoke up while our planet suffered.

1:22:32.243 --> 1:22:34.371
All because
we didn't want to create disharmony.

1:22:34.454 --> 1:22:36.206
And now our planet's gone.

1:22:36.873 --> 1:22:40.418
Harmony isn't silence.
Unity isn't sameness.

1:22:40.502 --> 1:22:43.546
Love is powerful.
It can handle disagreements.

1:22:45.465 --> 1:22:47.759
I know where
my grandma wanted her people to live!

1:22:48.802 --> 1:22:51.680
The most
perfectly imperfect place there is.

1:22:57.811 --> 1:23:00.480
Yes. You have found our new home.

1:23:02.774 --> 1:23:04.192
Take us there, Mothership.

1:23:05.527 --> 1:23:06.528
Please.

1:23:11.533 --> 1:23:13.493
How come you don't have alien hair
like your grandmother?

1:23:13.576 --> 1:23:17.163
Because I'm not an alien.
I'm an ordinary person.

1:23:17.247 --> 1:23:19.249
An extraordinarily normal,

1:23:19.332 --> 1:23:23.128
fantastically fabulous,
ordinary awesome person!

1:23:23.211 --> 1:23:24.963
Bucky, if you were different,

1:23:25.046 --> 1:23:26.673
-you know we'd--
-Mock me?

1:23:26.756 --> 1:23:28.049
Accept you.

1:23:28.591 --> 1:23:29.843
Oh!

1:23:29.926 --> 1:23:32.637
Seabrook High's really gonna miss
your awesomeness, Bucky.

1:23:33.388 --> 1:23:34.514
Yeah.

1:23:35.932 --> 1:23:37.934
I'm really gonna miss me too!

1:23:38.518 --> 1:23:41.354
-Come on. Let's go celebrate.
-Tell me again how great I am.

1:23:43.398 --> 1:23:46.192
It is gonna be awesome
when we're all at college.

1:23:46.776 --> 1:23:49.529
Leaving Seabrook isn't the end.
It's the beginning.

1:23:50.030 --> 1:23:53.783
I miss Addison so much.
I wish she could be here.

1:23:53.867 --> 1:23:57.162
Me too. We were gonna change the world.

1:24:06.504 --> 1:24:07.881
Addison!

1:24:07.964 --> 1:24:09.507
You came back!

1:24:11.426 --> 1:24:13.678
You thought I was gonna let
intergalactic space travel

1:24:13.762 --> 1:24:15.013
get in the way of graduating?

1:24:15.096 --> 1:24:16.848
But what about utopia?

1:24:16.931 --> 1:24:18.600
Seabrook is our utopia.

1:24:18.683 --> 1:24:21.311
But Seabrook isn't a perfect place.

1:24:21.394 --> 1:24:24.898
It's not. It's messy, emotional…

1:24:26.024 --> 1:24:27.484
Full of surprises.

1:24:29.402 --> 1:24:30.945
Where change can happen.

1:24:31.029 --> 1:24:32.989
Where someday can be today.

1:24:33.073 --> 1:24:34.783
What a perfect place to call home.

1:24:34.866 --> 1:24:39.788
Now I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm just one proud mothership.

1:24:39.871 --> 1:24:41.206
I love you kids.

1:24:42.374 --> 1:24:43.875
-Party!
-Party! Let's go!

1:24:44.751 --> 1:24:46.419
-What?
-Come on, Bonzo!

1:24:46.503 --> 1:24:48.338
-Yeah!

1:24:53.093 --> 1:24:56.971
So, yeah.
The aliens are moving into Seabrook.

1:24:59.516 --> 1:25:03.019
And even though our community
is stronger than ever,

1:25:03.853 --> 1:25:09.442
and we're breaking down barriers
every day, there's still more to learn.

1:25:10.735 --> 1:25:15.156
So whatever the future holds for our
monster of a town, we'll be ready for it.

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:17.117
Because Seabrook's not about perfect.

1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:18.201
It's about progress.

1:25:18.284 --> 1:25:21.705
