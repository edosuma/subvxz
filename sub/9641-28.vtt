00:07.083 --> 00:11.250
OK, now while your mother
and I are out of town
on our anniversary weekend

00:11.250 --> 00:15.416
I want you guys to take care of
the Sub Station's new mascot,

00:15.416 --> 00:18.000
Teddy Bear Cam... per.

00:19.250 --> 00:22.625
It's... it's a bear
that can camp.

00:23.875 --> 00:25.583
Well, don't all bears camp?

00:26.875 --> 00:28.458
'Cause they live in the woods.

00:30.583 --> 00:32.500
Well, what's that sticking out
of her belly button?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.875
- Is that a camera?
- No, it's nothing!

00:34.875 --> 00:37.291
And don't block it.

00:37.291 --> 00:38.958
It looks a lot like a camera.

00:38.958 --> 00:41.000
Harper, come here!
How's my make up?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.875
Oh! Good. Is my face shiny?

00:42.875 --> 00:45.583
'Cause sometimes in videos
I look like a glazed donut.

00:51.125 --> 00:54.833
Look, it's just a little old and
has some stuffing sticking out.

00:54.833 --> 00:58.166
Isn't that what Mom said about
you at the beach last summer?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.166
Dad, look, I know the last time

01:02.166 --> 01:04.625
you left us in charge of
the sub shop we had a little

01:04.625 --> 01:07.375
Shakira/Uncle Kelbo
problem, with the...

01:11.083 --> 01:14.750
But, I'm here to promise you
that nothing bad will happen
this time while you're gone.

01:14.750 --> 01:18.125
OK, honey.
I'm ready to go.

01:18.125 --> 01:19.416
Happy anniversary, honey.

01:19.416 --> 01:22.083
Get ready for a romantic
weekend in Connecticut.

01:22.083 --> 01:25.750
I'll get us a cab.
Bye, kids. And remember,

01:25.750 --> 01:28.708
Teddy Bear Camper needs
to greet all the customers

01:28.708 --> 01:30.833
and watch the cash register.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.500
Mama, I thought your anniversary
was, like, next month?

01:37.500 --> 01:41.875
Oh... It is.
Your father forgot.

01:41.875 --> 01:44.458
This way I'll get another trip
next month when I remind him.

01:44.458 --> 01:47.083
It's all good.
OK, bye, guys!

01:47.083 --> 01:50.458
And don't try to pull anything
on me, like I'm pulling on him.

01:52.083 --> 01:53.583
Alex, come on, get to work.

01:53.583 --> 01:55.166
We're not gonna
let Dad down this time.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.708
Well, then maybe Dad
shouldn't see anything...

01:59.000 --> 02:00.708
...that would let him down.

02:00.708 --> 02:04.166
- You can't do that.
- Oh, sure I can.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.250
Max will take the heat.
Watch. Max!

02:06.250 --> 02:09.250
- Yeah?
- Why did you throw Dad's
teddy bear into the trash?

02:09.250 --> 02:12.375
I don't know. I just do stuff,
all right? Get off my back.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.125
That'll work.

02:19.625 --> 02:21.583
Invite. Invite.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.750
Invite for you.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.750
Hey, guys, guess what?

02:25.750 --> 02:28.291
The crossing guard
accepted my friend request.

02:28.291 --> 02:30.458
I finally have enough friends
to throw a party.

02:30.458 --> 02:34.250
- Hey!
- Congratulations, Zeke.

02:34.250 --> 02:38.208
Oh, thanks! Justin, can I
start planning some party
hors d'oeuvres in your kitchen?

02:38.208 --> 02:42.708
Yes, Zeke, but we're dudes.
We don't say "hors d'oeuvres."

02:44.458 --> 02:46.000
Munchie-wunchies?

02:48.125 --> 02:50.333
- Just say "hors d'oeuvres."
- OK.

02:54.416 --> 02:57.250
This is great. I've always
wanted to crash a party.

02:57.250 --> 03:01.416
Max, you can't crash a party
if you're already invited to it.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.708
Well, then maybe...
I'm not invited.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.416
So, Alex, what are you
gonna wear to the party?

03:12.416 --> 03:15.625
I'm thinking my slippers,

03:15.625 --> 03:17.583
my gray sweats
with holes in them,

03:17.583 --> 03:19.375
and my dad's
old concert T-shirt

03:19.375 --> 03:22.083
from the band called
Oingo Boingo.

03:23.958 --> 03:26.458
That name cracks me up.
I don't...

03:28.291 --> 03:30.250
- Oh, my gosh!
- The owners

03:30.250 --> 03:32.875
of this unbelievably talented
dog say that he's been

03:32.875 --> 03:37.750
painting unusual pieces
ever since they found him here
in the Pocono Mountains...

03:37.750 --> 03:40.416
That's him. That's Mason.
He loved to paint.

03:40.416 --> 03:41.625
I don't think so, Alex.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.750
Every time you see a dog
in a human interest story

03:43.750 --> 03:45.083
you think it's Mason.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.500
Remember the skateboarding
bulldog?

03:47.500 --> 03:49.875
Yeah, you probably just
miss him so much

03:49.875 --> 03:51.500
you want to believe it's him.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.333
- Mm-hm.
- Most puzzling

03:53.333 --> 03:56.875
is the picture of this girl
he paints over and over.

03:58.458 --> 04:01.458
Some would say she's
a backwoods Mona Lisa.

Alex, you don't even know
that's Mason.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.708
That's why I have to go.
To find out.

05:00.708 --> 05:04.875
The last time you saw him
he was running off into
the Transylvania woods.

05:04.875 --> 05:07.208
He's a wolf now.
You can't change that.

05:07.208 --> 05:11.416
Justin, if you had a chance
to be with Juliet for just
one more minute,

05:11.416 --> 05:13.583
even though she's old now,
would you take it?

05:16.708 --> 05:18.291
Look, I'll be fine.

05:18.291 --> 05:21.875
But all you know is
that he's somewhere
in the Pocono Mountains.

05:21.875 --> 05:24.333
Max, how's your howling?

05:27.583 --> 05:30.000
- Never better.
- Let's go.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.166
Max! Come...
Are you...?!

05:34.000 --> 05:36.875
If Mom and Dad find out
that Alex and Max
got eaten by a wolf,

05:36.875 --> 05:39.250
Guess who's grounded? Me!

05:39.250 --> 05:42.708
Well, then go help her.
Zeke and I will watch the shop.

05:42.708 --> 05:46.583
Besides, it'll give me
a chance to be alone with him
for our first kiss.

05:46.583 --> 05:48.125
You're not gonna
wait till the party?

05:48.125 --> 05:50.750
There's gonna be
enough awkwardness at the party

05:50.750 --> 05:53.833
just with Zeke dancing, I don't
wanna add a first kiss to that.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.125
Hey, guys!
I figured it out.

05:57.125 --> 05:59.833
We're having 14-layer bean dip
at my party!

05:59.833 --> 06:02.833
Mmm! So good!

06:05.083 --> 06:07.583
Well...

06:07.583 --> 06:10.000
- Good luck with that kiss,
Harper.
- Yep.

06:16.291 --> 06:20.083
We've looked everywhere
in these woods.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.708
Maybe we'll have luck here.
Do it again, Max.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.625
Knock on the door and
see if they know anything.

06:35.875 --> 06:37.708
Come on in, it's open.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.125
I'm so sorry.

06:41.125 --> 06:42.875
Oh, don't you mind that.

06:42.875 --> 06:46.458
Pa is gonna fix it as soon
as it's our turn for
the town screwdriver.

06:48.416 --> 06:52.250
Well, just don't stand there
collecting dust. Come on in.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.625
Pa, put your knittin' down.

06:55.375 --> 06:58.125
Junior we got company.
Put your shoe on.

06:59.708 --> 07:01.875
I'm sorry, we don't
mean to bother you,

07:01.875 --> 07:04.166
we just wanted to come by and
talk to you about your wolf...

07:04.166 --> 07:06.000
Dog! Painting dog.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.208
Why?

07:08.208 --> 07:11.833
We don't need no city folk
looky-loos, gawking at Doug.

07:11.833 --> 07:14.875
Sir, we're not looky-loos.

07:14.875 --> 07:18.250
We are...
We are from... the museum.

07:18.250 --> 07:21.125
- Mm-hm.
- Museum? Which museum?

07:21.125 --> 07:24.416
- The...
- The famous museum...

07:24.416 --> 07:27.291
- ...famous...
- ...of art and statues...

07:27.291 --> 07:29.416
- Statues. Mm-hm.
- ...and stuff.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.125
I heard of that.

07:32.875 --> 07:33.958
You have?

07:33.958 --> 07:36.458
You callin' me a liar?

07:36.458 --> 07:38.833
Of course not.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.458
We would like to have
an exhibit of Doug's artwork
for the museum.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.708
Why sure,
Mr. Museum Feller.

07:44.708 --> 07:47.166
Junior, go fetch Doug.

07:47.166 --> 07:51.000
Pa, why don't you heat up
some of your squirrel stew
for these nice folks?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.375
- All right.
- Excuse me, I can't eat that.

07:53.375 --> 07:56.291
I hate stew.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.708
Can you put the squirrel
in something else, possibly?

07:58.708 --> 08:01.208
Uh... Squirrel kabobs?

08:01.208 --> 08:03.416
Keep 'em coming!

08:08.500 --> 08:10.750
That dog looks
just like Mason.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.875
I need to know for sure.
Keep them busy.

08:12.875 --> 08:17.125
Junior, can... can I have
a better look at Doug,

08:17.125 --> 08:19.166
over here by the...

08:19.166 --> 08:21.333
...by the corn?

08:23.583 --> 08:25.875
So, you guys,...
this is a...

08:25.875 --> 08:28.583
...a lovely home you have.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.625
Can you show me around
a little bit?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Can you, uh... Ho-ho!

08:39.000 --> 08:41.625
Can you tell me a little bit
about this here chair?

08:41.625 --> 08:44.250
Oh! That's Junior's
time out chair.

08:45.833 --> 08:47.958
Sometimes I'm bad.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.708
- Mason, is that you?
- - This piece of artwork over here...

08:55.708 --> 08:57.958
...you mind explaining it
to me?

08:57.958 --> 09:00.750
There's only one way
to find out.

09:00.750 --> 09:04.958
We need them to stuff a mattress for Junior.
He's gonna sleep inside soon.

09:04.958 --> 09:08.125
Oh, yeah!

09:08.125 --> 09:09.958
I've missed you so much.

09:21.291 --> 09:25.583
Wow. How much did you
splurge on this, Jerry?

09:29.708 --> 09:31.750
How much did you
save on this, Jerry?

09:32.708 --> 09:34.875
Enough to get us a free night.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.000
Or a hot fudge sundae.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.583
This room costs the same
as a hot fudge sundae?

09:40.583 --> 09:44.291
Yeah, but if you get nuts,
then it's more than the room.

09:46.208 --> 09:50.083
Hey, look, my spy bear's
hooked up.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.625
Let's see what's going on.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.708
What?! They threw my
teddy bear cam in the trash?

10:00.708 --> 10:02.875
I'm gonna call and find out
what's happening.

10:04.375 --> 10:06.416
A dollar a minute?!

10:17.375 --> 10:19.333
♪ Hey, Zeke,
why you so smart? ♪

10:19.333 --> 10:22.875
♪ I don't know, I'm just good
I know it ♪

10:28.333 --> 10:29.958
Hi.

10:31.250 --> 10:32.583
Uh... Zeke,

10:32.583 --> 10:34.875
I just wanted to thank you
for staying here with me

10:34.875 --> 10:37.250
while our friends are out
looking for their dog.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.416
I would have been here
all alone.

10:39.416 --> 10:42.000
And now it's just
you and I here.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.583
All alone.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.750
Yeah, I hate being alone.

10:47.750 --> 10:51.833
But, I'm probably alone
a lot because I'm not
a very good listener.

10:51.833 --> 10:53.708
I mean, I didn't even know
Justin had a dog.

10:57.166 --> 11:00.458
Well, since it's just
you and me here alone,

11:00.458 --> 11:04.458
maybe we should talk
about taking the next step
in our relationship.

11:04.458 --> 11:07.000
Is your arm OK?
You keep doing this with it?

11:12.166 --> 11:13.958
It's... it's fine, Zeke.

11:13.958 --> 11:15.583
Well, I definitely agree.

11:15.583 --> 11:18.250
As long as that next step
in our relationship
involves better listening.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.375
Because Justin probably
told me he had a dog

11:20.375 --> 11:24.125
and it just went blah-blah-blah
in this ear, and blah-blah-blah
out that ear.

11:24.125 --> 11:26.750
Just forget about the dog, OK?

11:33.166 --> 11:34.708
We're busy!

11:36.083 --> 11:40.500
So, where... were we?

11:43.291 --> 11:45.250
I was... cleaning that table.

11:54.291 --> 11:59.375
Mm-mm! Now that is some
yummy-licious squirrel, Pa.

11:59.375 --> 12:01.625
You sure you don't want some,
Museum Lady?

12:04.833 --> 12:07.583
Well, why don't I fix
some possum pie

12:07.583 --> 12:10.291
after we do some
music entertainin'?

12:11.500 --> 12:13.458
Squirrel kabobs and a show?

12:13.458 --> 12:15.500
I love me the country life.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.708
Am I holding this thing
upside down, or should I...
'Cause...

12:22.291 --> 12:23.958
It doesn't matter.

12:23.958 --> 12:26.208
All right, boys,
follow along now.

12:26.208 --> 12:28.291
A one and a two,
and a one, two...

12:45.125 --> 12:46.875
- Alex?
- Mason!

12:51.416 --> 12:54.875
You changed me back.
Thank you.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.000
I didn't do it.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.500
Ha! You was right, Ma.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.583
That news story
snagged us some wiz-ards.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.166
They's just like us.

13:13.708 --> 13:15.083
Who changed you back?

13:15.083 --> 13:17.208
- We did.
- How?

13:17.208 --> 13:19.500
Who cares?
I've got Mason back.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.208
Yep, Junior.
They's wizards like us.

13:22.208 --> 13:24.000
No they ain't.

13:24.958 --> 13:27.208
We're country wizards.

13:27.208 --> 13:28.958
Oh my gosh,
country wizard wands.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.583
Hey, what's going on?
And how did you get Mason?

13:33.583 --> 13:35.708
Hold your horses, Alex.

13:35.708 --> 13:39.291
They got hairpin triggers.
Don't get them riled up.

13:41.958 --> 13:46.291
Sorry, I guess some of their
quaint country colloquialisms
have rubbed off on me.

13:47.875 --> 13:49.208
We went through our portal

13:49.208 --> 13:52.000
to check the squirrel traps
in the Transylvania woods.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.208
Yep. We found Mason,

13:54.208 --> 13:56.375
took him in, had ourselves
a new huntin' dog,

13:56.375 --> 14:00.083
so Junior here don't
have to fetch the game
in his mouth no more.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.000
Nope.

14:04.583 --> 14:07.291
When we weren't huntin',
we kept Mason in the shed

14:07.291 --> 14:10.125
where he commenced to paintin'
pictures of a pretty girl.

14:10.125 --> 14:12.375
Since we found him
in the Transylvania woods,

14:12.375 --> 14:14.458
we figured she was
a wizard girl.

14:14.458 --> 14:17.583
Ah-ha! Then you
convinced the people from
the television program

14:17.583 --> 14:21.625
to do a piece on an
artistic dog to attract
another wizard family to you.

14:21.625 --> 14:26.208
No. We got the folks
in the TV box to do
a movin' picture show

14:26.208 --> 14:30.625
on a fancy drawin' dog to
lure another wizard clan to us.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.208
OK...

14:35.208 --> 14:37.583
So we're here. Now what?

14:37.583 --> 14:39.833
- We want your portal.
- What?!

14:39.833 --> 14:41.166
You see that?

14:41.166 --> 14:43.166
To the world,
it's an outhouse.

14:43.166 --> 14:47.250
To us, it's our Lair
with our portal inside.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.333
By the way, I stitched that.

14:51.583 --> 14:55.708
The dang county lawman told us
we had to build
an indoor bathroom,

14:55.708 --> 14:58.875
and then they bulldozed
our Outhouse Lair.

15:00.208 --> 15:02.958
Dad would have really liked
sitting in an Outhouse Lair.

15:04.375 --> 15:07.458
Every wizard family
only gets one portal.

15:07.458 --> 15:09.458
So you guys have no way
back into the wizard world.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.708
Here's what I'm proposin':

15:11.708 --> 15:15.875
You give us your portal
and we let wolf-boy here
go home with Missy.

15:15.875 --> 15:18.000
- Deal.
- No deal!

15:18.000 --> 15:20.750
You country wizards
is e-vil.

15:20.750 --> 15:24.625
See, now you got me
gesticulatin' and figgerin'
like yous do.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.000
That's e-vil.

15:28.833 --> 15:34.500
Look, I know how much you
and Mason care for each other,
but I'm sorry.

15:34.500 --> 15:38.708
There's no way we can give up
our portal. I hope you
can understand one day.

15:38.708 --> 15:43.083
Ma, Pa, please let Mason
go with me. I love him.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.875
It's not like
he's any use to you.

15:44.875 --> 15:48.875
If you ain't gonna make a deal,
you best get.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.000
Now! Move it!

15:52.083 --> 15:54.291
Not you.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.875
Justin! We can't leave Mason.

15:56.875 --> 15:59.125
There's nothing we can do, Alex.
We've got to get out of here.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.458
These guys mean business.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.833
- You still here?
- Get off our land!

16:02.833 --> 16:04.708
- Come on!
- Wait.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.875
I have to say
goodbye to Mason.

16:10.958 --> 16:14.458
Oh... they changed you back.

16:19.208 --> 16:23.125
I'll trade you our portal
for Mason. Wait for me
to flash you into our Lair.

16:26.583 --> 16:29.416
Hey. Hi. Excuse me.

16:29.416 --> 16:32.416
Before I go, you think I can
have a squirrel doggie bag?

16:32.416 --> 16:35.875
Perhaps wrapped in foil,
in the shape of a crab?

16:35.875 --> 16:38.875
Son, you make
less than no sense.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.083
- You just made yourselves
an enemy...
- Come on!

16:51.583 --> 16:53.125
I'm Zeke,
I'll be your server.

16:57.416 --> 17:02.166
Zeke, what color are my eyes
when you look real close?

17:02.166 --> 17:04.750
Oh, the distance has no effect
on the eye color.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.000
If it's hazel from here,
it's hazel from there.

17:08.583 --> 17:11.250
I knew dating a younger
woman would have its challenges.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.750
So, how'd it go?

17:17.750 --> 17:22.375
Pretty good. I ate squirrel,
made some new enemies.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.000
It was a regular day.

17:27.458 --> 17:29.375
So, how'd it go?

17:31.583 --> 17:33.083
How'd it go?

17:34.458 --> 17:36.958
- Was it Mason?
- Yes.

17:36.958 --> 17:41.125
It was him, but he's being held
by some country wizards

17:41.125 --> 17:46.000
who grow corn by their beds,
and have a son with one shoe.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.375
Oh, good. I thought you were
gonna say something crazy.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.875
I was on my ninth layer
of the bean dip

17:54.875 --> 17:57.625
and I got a jalapeño seed
stuck in my throat.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.833
Get... cough...

18:01.291 --> 18:04.458
Ah! It's stuck in my nose!

18:04.458 --> 18:08.333
Now it's in my eye!
It's a traveling jalapeno seed!

18:08.333 --> 18:09.833
I'll go get the eye wash.

18:16.625 --> 18:20.250
Zeke, this party has you
all stressed out, man.

18:20.250 --> 18:23.000
It's not the party, man.
It's Harper.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.500
I think she's trying to get me
alone so she can kiss me.

18:27.083 --> 18:29.083
It's my first time.

18:30.416 --> 18:32.708
I know.

18:32.708 --> 18:34.583
- I really think you should do it.
- - Yeah?

18:34.583 --> 18:39.458
Take it from someone who has had
a ton of experience in amour.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.250
Alex!

18:46.583 --> 18:48.125
We are pleased as punch

18:48.125 --> 18:49.958
you decided to
make the swap, Missy.

18:49.958 --> 18:51.708
I'd swap anything for Mason.

18:51.708 --> 18:55.083
Giving up your portal
is an enormous sacrifice, Alex.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.708
Are you sure you
won't ever regret this?

18:56.708 --> 18:58.833
Regret is for the weak.

18:58.833 --> 19:03.458
That's my Alex,
lovely and scary.

19:04.875 --> 19:07.250
Well, let's get this show
on the road.

19:07.250 --> 19:08.750
Get what show
on the road?

19:08.750 --> 19:10.875
Alex, what are you doing?!

19:10.875 --> 19:12.708
What are they doing here?

19:12.708 --> 19:15.416
Who cares? I've been waiting
for this opportunity.

19:15.416 --> 19:19.583
Ahh... hello.
Welcome to my home.

19:19.583 --> 19:22.208
Are you hungry?
Can I get you something to eat?

19:22.208 --> 19:23.583
You get nothing.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.416
Revenge is sweet,
isn't it?

19:29.375 --> 19:31.750
Alex, I won't let you
give away our portal.

19:31.750 --> 19:35.250
Oh, I am so sorry,
my dear brother,

19:35.250 --> 19:37.750
but you are too late
to stop me

19:37.750 --> 19:41.750
from trading our portal
for Mason's return.

19:41.750 --> 19:43.416
You... Look at the door!

19:48.250 --> 19:50.083
You see?

19:50.083 --> 19:54.958
Our portal will soon be removed
by their mighty lumberjack saw.

19:54.958 --> 19:57.583
Yep. That's me.

19:59.125 --> 20:03.000
Oh, well then,
we should show them the door.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.708
Which is right behind me.
Purple.

20:07.333 --> 20:09.708
Yes, yes. Now, you guys
go check it out,

20:09.708 --> 20:12.000
because once we trade,
there's not any un-trades.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.458
Sure is dark.

20:15.458 --> 20:18.083
It's the energy-saver model.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.625
Oh, they're goin' green, Ma.

20:21.833 --> 20:23.958
Uh, the light switch
is there over to the left.

20:23.958 --> 20:27.708
Further. Further.
A little bit further.
Little bit... yeah.

20:27.708 --> 20:31.583
- Hey!
- You tricked us!
We got no powers in here!

20:31.583 --> 20:33.583
It's locked.

20:34.958 --> 20:37.833
Knock knock. Who's there?
Disappear. Disappear who?

20:37.833 --> 20:40.083
Dis appears to be a door
eaten by termites.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.833
That was amazing! Instantly
picked up on Alex's game.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.833
Yep, my skills are sharp.

20:56.833 --> 20:59.500
Razor sharp.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.750
- Where did you send them?
- I don't know.

21:03.750 --> 21:07.875
They're just floating in some
magical limbo somewhere.
But who cares?

21:07.875 --> 21:10.000
The important thing is that
we're back together.

21:13.583 --> 21:16.166
No!

21:17.250 --> 21:18.708
What happened?

21:20.500 --> 21:23.125
Well, maybe you broke
your deal with them,

21:23.125 --> 21:25.250
so they broke
their deal with you.

21:26.958 --> 21:29.416
What am I gonna do, Justin?

21:30.958 --> 21:32.166
I don't know.

21:37.166 --> 21:39.458
Next time on
Wizards of Waverly Place:

21:39.458 --> 21:41.458
I can't believe it.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.208
My true love is a wolf again.

21:43.208 --> 21:46.083
I give up! I'm never gonna get
you to kiss me, Zeke Beakerman!

21:46.083 --> 21:49.958
If we just play these,
maybe it'll turn Mason
into human again.

21:49.958 --> 21:53.083
I believe that Mason will
be stuck in this...

21:53.083 --> 21:55.291
...in-between stage,
we'll call it.
