02:36.500 --> 02:37.667
AFFORD TO MOVE OUT YET BECAUSE

02:37.667 --> 02:38.733
HE JUST BOUGHT THIS PLACE.

02:38.733 --> 02:39.533

05:46.067 --> 05:46.867
WE'VE ONLY BEEN TOGETHER FOR,

05:46.867 --> 05:47.467
LIKE, THREE WEEKS.

05:47.467 --> 05:49.233
BUT A GIRL NEEDS TO CLARIFY

05:49.233 --> 05:50.567
CERTAIN THINGS BEFORE SHE

05:50.567 --> 05:52.167
COMMITS, LIKE, DO YOU WANT A

DO YOU WANT BABIES?

05:53.867 --> 05:55.100
IS YOUR MAMA NOSY?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.067
I HADN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO THE MAMA

05:56.067 --> 05:56.800
PART YET.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.267
>> WELL, AT LEAST NOW FINALLY

05:58.267 --> 05:59.400
YOU HAVE A MAN TO ASK ALL THESE

05:59.400 --> 06:00.167
QUESTIONS.

06:19.067 --> 06:20.867
[laughter]

06:20.867 --> 06:22.333
>> OH.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.433
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK.

06:23.433 --> 06:25.300
>> MISTRESS NUMBER NINE.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.067
STILL NOTHING TO SAY, HUH?

06:27.067 --> 06:28.600
>> I AM SO SORRY.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.267
NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT I DON'T

06:31.267 --> 06:32.533
THINK ABOUT HOW WRONG I WAS, AND

06:32.533 --> 06:35.100
IF THERE WAS ANY WAY TO MAKE

06:35.100 --> 06:36.500
AMENDS, I WOULD, BUT--

06:36.500 --> 06:37.700
>> GIRL, CALM DOWN.

06:37.700 --> 06:38.700
I'M OVER IT.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.167
>> JENNIFER, THANK YOU

06:41.167 --> 06:42.100
SO MUCH FOR SAYING THAT.

06:42.100 --> 06:42.900
>> NO, HOLD UP.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.533
DON'T GET IT CONFUSED.

06:44.533 --> 06:47.067
WE WILL NEVER BE FRIENDS.

06:47.067 --> 06:48.833
BUT I FOUND IT IN MY HEART TO

06:48.833 --> 06:50.733
FORGIVE ALL OF YOU.

06:50.733 --> 06:52.767
PLUS, I'VE MET SOMEONE.

06:52.767 --> 06:54.833
AND HE'S THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.700
>> I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.100
YOU DESERVE IT.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.333
AND I WILL SEND SOME CHAMPAGNE

06:59.333 --> 07:00.333
OVER TO YOUR TABLE.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.367
>> THANK YOU.

07:01.367 --> 07:03.600
THAT'S THE LEAST YOU CAN DO.

I WOULD HAVE LEFT, BUT SHE

18:11.767 --> 18:13.467
STAYED, KEPT THE FAMILY

18:13.467 --> 18:15.467
TOGETHER.

18:15.467 --> 18:17.067
