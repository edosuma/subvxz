[Barb] Bubbles!

00:44.169 --> 00:46.796
Hey, Barb. Oh, decent,
you got me some empties.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.716
-[clattering]
-I want these out of my park!

00:49.799 --> 00:51.468
All of them!
They're everywhere!

00:51.551 --> 00:52.886
What do you mean,
all of them?

00:52.969 --> 00:54.679
I collected these
coming down here!

00:54.763 --> 00:56.806
Th-th-they're... they're in ditches,
they're in bushes,

00:56.890 --> 00:59.225
they're all over the playground!

00:59.309 --> 01:01.019
They're... They're up trees,
they're under people's cars!

01:01.102 --> 01:03.021
-Okay, okay...
-They're up my ass!

01:03.104 --> 01:06.149
Okay, Barb. Just relax!
I understand, but...

01:06.232 --> 01:10.403
I mean, that's not really my problem.
I mean, I run a very tight ship here.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.155
-[scoffing]
-I run it very clean...

01:12.238 --> 01:14.199
It's not your... It's not your problem?

01:14.282 --> 01:17.035
Well, no, it isn't because once I sell
the fucking bottles to somebody,

01:17.118 --> 01:19.370
who owns the bottles?
They do! Not me!

01:19.454 --> 01:20.622
It's not my responsibility.

01:20.705 --> 01:24.459
Well, it is my responsibility
to keep this park rodent-free,

01:24.542 --> 01:27.086
and it seems to me that the only way
to deal with that

01:27.170 --> 01:30.840
is to go to the source of the problem
and get rid of it!

01:30.924 --> 01:32.425
What? Oh, Barb!

01:32.842 --> 01:34.135
Come on, this is all I got!

01:34.219 --> 01:35.512
This is my business!

01:35.595 --> 01:38.264
Look, I'll fucking work with you,
we can sort this out.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.351
I mean, I can...
I can start a recycling program,

01:41.434 --> 01:43.186
-maybe charge people a deposit.
-Oh, for God's sake!

01:43.269 --> 01:45.605
Bubbles, people aren't gonna...
People aren't gonna pay a deposit.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.483
They can barely pay for the shit water
you're making!

01:48.566 --> 01:50.860
It's not! That's delicious,
quality product.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.571
For God's sake... I wanna see
a drastic change, Bubbles!

01:53.655 --> 01:56.116
And I wanna see it today!

01:56.574 --> 01:57.492
Okay.

01:59.619 --> 02:00.787
[exhaling]

02:00.870 --> 02:03.790
Oh, hey, Julian.
You're in your fucking court clothes.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.041
Big surprise.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.417
On your way to fucking court!

02:06.501 --> 02:08.627
Bubs, I'm not going to court, man.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.256
Well, I've got no more
fucking money.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.049
And I'm not spotting you
any more beer,

02:13.133 --> 02:15.009
I only bottled enough
for my deliveries.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.095
-I owe Donnie a fucking case...
-Bubs, Bubs, Bubs.

02:17.178 --> 02:20.515
I don't want any free beer.
I don't want free anything, man, okay?

02:20.598 --> 02:22.559
-[sigh]
-I'm going to get a job.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.521
What?

02:26.604 --> 02:29.482
I've been thinking about what you said
to me, man, and you're right, you know?

02:29.566 --> 02:33.236
It's time for me to grow the fuck up.
It's time for all of us to grow up.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.114
So I'm gonna go down to the mall,
fill out a bunch of applications

02:36.197 --> 02:38.366
and, you know,
see what happens.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.952
Okay, what's really
going on here, Julian?

02:41.035 --> 02:42.996
Because I know
you're not fucking serious.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.622
[scoffing]
Serious enough

02:44.706 --> 02:46.875
that I'm not taking
this fucking thing with me.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.919
Here, hang on to that for me.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.422
Come on, take it.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.259
Oh, my God.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.721
You're going to the mall
without your drink?

02:59.804 --> 03:02.307
No, I'm still going to have a drink.
You know, I'm not just...

03:02.390 --> 03:05.768
I'm not gonna take the glass with me.
It'll be a little less obvious, you know?

03:06.936 --> 03:08.730
Oh, my God, Julian...

03:10.023 --> 03:11.357
you're fucking serious.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.817
Fucking rights, I'm serious.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.905
Come here! Come here!

03:16.988 --> 03:18.197
[whimpering]

03:18.823 --> 03:20.575
I'm fucking proud of you, Julian.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.535
-Thanks, man.
-Oh, my God.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.620
I love you.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.414
Back at you, buddy.
All right, wish me luck.

03:26.831 --> 03:27.957
[Bubbles whimpers]

03:32.545 --> 03:35.590
Godspeed, my muscular friend.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.383
[sighing]

03:37.467 --> 03:39.886
[theme music]

04:19.926 --> 04:21.469
Dude, this is awesome.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.513
We're gonna make a killing off
these bottles.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.890
It's like almost 250 a pop.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.268
Cory, first of all, we're not
gonna make anything.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.937
It's a fucking deposit
that we've gotta give back.

04:31.020 --> 04:34.232
And what do you mean, "250 a pop"?
Where are you getting that?

04:34.315 --> 04:36.985
Well, I multiple 2 times 24, dude.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.444
224.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.781
2 times 24 is not 224.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.199
Yeah, check it.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.410
Look: 2 times 24.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.411
224.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.871
That's how you multiply, is it, Cory?

04:48.955 --> 04:51.791
Okay, show me what's
10 times 10, Cory?

04:51.874 --> 04:55.169
Well, 10 times 10...
1-0-1-0, dude.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.214
Oh, my God.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.259
That is not how you multiply, Cory.
I'm sorry.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.428
Well, everyone has
their own way of multiple, dude,

05:03.511 --> 05:05.722
and it's all the same results.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.099
-We're gonna rock it.
-Just give me this.

05:08.182 --> 05:10.435
I'll deal with the math.
Get me some empties,

05:10.518 --> 05:12.520
then I'll start doling out
the high fives.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.856
-Okay.
-Okay. Don't use your brain.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.524
Well... Okay.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.318
Wassup, Mo?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.320
All right, cool.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.071
Hey, Trin. Hey, Mo.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.325
[in high-pitched voice]
Who's got your...

05:25.408 --> 05:26.868
belly! Hee hee hee!

05:26.951 --> 05:28.411
[giggling]

05:28.494 --> 05:30.496
-He's just like a big kitty.
-Gotta put you down.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.498
-Hey, Bubs.
-What's going on?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.334
I think Dad's losing it.

05:34.542 --> 05:39.047
Oh, Trin, your dad lost it
a long time ago. No offence.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.298
What's wrong?

05:40.381 --> 05:42.884
No, he gave me his car house.
Said he's giving up.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.261
He said he's gonna be gone forever
after today.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.555
What?

05:49.682 --> 05:53.269
Hey, Ricky, what's going on?
How come you're packing up your suitcase?

05:53.352 --> 05:55.563
Hey, Bubs. I was just about
to come say goodbye.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.774
Well, what's going on?
Are you okay?

05:57.857 --> 05:59.942
Actually, I feel great
and it's all thanks to you.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.652
Thinkin' a lot about
what you said and...

06:01.736 --> 06:04.405
you're totally right.
I'm better off in jail.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.616
What? I never said that, Ricky.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.369
Well, not those exact words,
but you did say I was a loser, and I am.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.455
Not a single thing in
this universe I'm good at except

06:12.538 --> 06:15.124
fucking growing dope
and, well, banging.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.627
And now Susan's gone
and the dope's gone, so...

06:17.835 --> 06:20.004
Only place I'm not a menace
to society or a loser is fucking jail,

06:20.088 --> 06:21.130
so that's where I'm going.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.509
Ricky, you're not a fucking menace
to society now.

06:24.592 --> 06:25.802
Yes, I am.

06:26.928 --> 06:30.389
I almost made my son-of-law
a fucking paralegic.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.266
What?

06:32.350 --> 06:34.435
What happened?
What are you talking about?

06:34.519 --> 06:37.105
Jacob, you wanna come out
here for a second, please?

06:37.188 --> 06:39.440
-[Jacob] What? Hold on.
-What did you do to him?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.442
I'm a fucking asshole,
that's what I did to him.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.819
[Jacob moaning]

06:43.820 --> 06:45.404
What do you need?

06:45.488 --> 06:47.532
-Oh, fuck!
-Fuck...

06:48.324 --> 06:50.785
Jacob, what happened to you?

06:50.868 --> 06:54.038
Ricky made me punch
his engagement horse in the ass.

06:54.122 --> 06:57.458
Then it kicked me through the barn door
and broke my neck.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.544
Oh, my fuck!
Your neck's broke?

06:59.627 --> 07:02.338
He was this close to having fucking
no arms, no legs, because of me.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.340
So I'm gonna do something
really fucking stupid

07:04.423 --> 07:06.843
and probably go to jail
for the rest of my life. So...

07:07.760 --> 07:09.345
Thanks for helping me
see things more clearly.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.555
-Ricky...
-You're really good at that.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.723
Ricky, just hang on now.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.309
I did not fucking say
anything like that,

07:15.393 --> 07:16.894
that isn't what I meant.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.564
Let's just... Why don't
we go down to the store?

07:19.647 --> 07:22.400
We'll get some fucking Moon Mist
ice creams like we used to

07:22.483 --> 07:24.193
and we'll sit at the picnic table

07:24.277 --> 07:26.863
and we'll talk it out,
and we'll figure it out. All right?

07:27.363 --> 07:29.782
Are you buying?
'Cause I don't have a fucking cent.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.160
I'll buy the ice creams.
Moon Mist.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.996
Okay. Jacob, do you want us
to pick you up anything?

07:35.079 --> 07:36.289
No, thanks, I'm okay, man.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.665
-I just need to lie down.
-Sure?

07:37.748 --> 07:39.208
[groaning]

07:39.292 --> 07:40.793
[Ricky] Hang in here. Looking good.

07:40.877 --> 07:41.836
[groaning]

07:41.919 --> 07:43.880
[Ricky] Oh, shit. If you need to use
the bathroom again,

07:43.963 --> 07:46.466
fuck, you've got to hold it
till I get back, I guess.

07:47.717 --> 07:51.429
I'm all in favour of spending some
quality time together down at the track,

07:51.512 --> 07:53.514
but I had an idea last night, Mr. Lahey.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.932
Will you listen to me?

07:55.016 --> 07:57.018
Oh, sure, Randy.
[indistinct]

07:57.477 --> 08:00.646
I think we should hire an Assistant
Assistant Trailer Park Supervisor.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.191
-[chuckles]
-To help us with our workload.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.444
No offence, Mr. Lahey, but you're getting
a little too old to handle the bullshit.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.029
[shushing]

08:08.112 --> 08:09.697
[slurring] The liquor speaks.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.533
There's no liquor here, sir.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.827
The liquor is in each
and every one of us, Randy.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.330
It's all around, all the time.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.043
The liquor's telling us to go down
to the horse track, Randy.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.711
It's a sign!

08:24.337 --> 08:26.464
We can talk about that
other stuff later, okay?

08:28.382 --> 08:30.384
Look. See this?

08:32.720 --> 08:34.472
This half of the money is ours.

08:34.554 --> 08:36.765
We're gonna cherish it,
we're gonna love it,

08:36.849 --> 08:39.936
and we're gonna protect it
for as long as we can, okay?

08:40.561 --> 08:43.356
See this pile?
This pile...

08:43.940 --> 08:46.275
belonged to the almighty Julian.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.736
But guess what?
Now it's free money!

08:49.153 --> 08:52.114
We can be a bit reckless with it
if we want to, Randy,

08:52.198 --> 08:55.159
because it's free, sexy money.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.745
I don't think this is a good idea.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.330
Randy...

08:59.956 --> 09:01.332
Can't you see?

09:01.415 --> 09:02.667
I was really fucked up.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.586
Now I'm so full of life
just playing with this shit!

09:05.670 --> 09:08.005
And, besides,
you told me yourself,

09:08.089 --> 09:11.968
it's got the best canteen
in Atlantic Canada.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.304
Okay then, Mr. Lahey.

09:15.846 --> 09:19.058
But promise me we're not gonna
get too frigging out of control.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.309
Randy.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.395
When have I ever done that?

09:23.229 --> 09:25.523
Working at the mall's pretty much
the bottom of the barrel,

09:25.606 --> 09:27.316
but it's the easiest place to get a job

09:27.400 --> 09:29.110
because there's such
a high turnover rate.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.695
You know, there's a couple
cool stores here.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.405
There's a sports store,
that's all right.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.198
And there's a supplement store,

09:34.282 --> 09:36.659
which would be neat
because I'd get a staff discount.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.704
But you know, it's not about the money,
it's not about any of that bullshit.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.039
It's about feeling good about myself.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.001
And you know,
Bubs made me realize that...

09:45.376 --> 09:48.462
that's something I haven't felt
in a long time, so... here I am.

09:49.463 --> 09:50.965
Maybe I could borrow
your truck later tonight

09:51.048 --> 09:53.342
and be a cab driver
for the drunks at the bars.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.553
You need a chauffeur's
licence for that, Ricky,

09:55.636 --> 09:57.305
and you know what's gonna happen.
You're gonna end up

09:57.388 --> 09:59.932
sitting out front of bars
fucking drunk and high every night.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.852
Yeah, good point. Well, maybe
I could work at the beach,

10:02.935 --> 10:04.520
doing something with the beach?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.813
The beach?

10:06.230 --> 10:09.734
There's not really any jobs
at the beach, Ricky.

10:09.817 --> 10:12.236
Other than a lifeguard,
and I don't think you can do that.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.988
You see? Like, I'm fucked!
There's nothing!

10:14.071 --> 10:16.198
I'm just gonna go back to jail,
it's fucking easier.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.492
We're done finishing these ice creams
and this fucking beautiful joint,

10:18.576 --> 10:21.329
I'm robbing that fucking store
and I'm going to jail! Fuck it!

10:21.412 --> 10:23.289
You're not.
You're not robbing the store.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.041
We can figure this out. Look...

10:25.458 --> 10:28.461
Just think about the last six months.
What have you done?

10:29.170 --> 10:32.214
Name something you've done
where you just felt fucking awesome.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.924
Banging.
Banging was good.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.052
Or eating or getting high or drunk,
I like that.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.094
Video games, hockey.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.179
I don't know... watching sports.

10:38.262 --> 10:41.349
No, I get all that, but you can't get
a job banging.

10:41.849 --> 10:45.186
Like, something you did where
you were just, like, "Fucking right on!"

10:45.269 --> 10:48.856
Like... there must be something, Ricky,
that makes you feel good.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.400
Well, I built that deck.
I know when that was done

10:51.484 --> 10:54.570
I fucking stood back and I'm looking
at it going, "Holy fuck, I built that."

10:54.654 --> 10:56.781
And it caused all these
weird feelings, like... I had...

10:56.864 --> 10:58.199
like, these buttermoth feelings that...

10:58.282 --> 11:00.201
they were trying to fly out
of my fucking mouth

11:00.284 --> 11:03.245
and my heart was about to explode.
It was good, whatever the fuck it was.

11:03.329 --> 11:07.375
Okay. I... See, I know. You're...
That's proud, Ricky. You felt proud.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.502
-That's what you call that?
-That's what you call it.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.045
I am proud.
The fucking deck's amazing.

11:11.128 --> 11:15.132
Right! You did fucking good work
with the carpentry, so that's it!

11:15.674 --> 11:18.010
Why don't you become a handyman?

11:18.094 --> 11:21.180
Bubs, I'm not gonna start giving out
fucking handies. I'm not that desperate.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.558
I don't mean that, Ricky.
Not male prostitute stuff.

11:25.017 --> 11:29.939
I mean, you know, like doing odd jobs,
little carpentry jobs...

11:30.022 --> 11:32.316
-around the park, you know?
-[slurping]

11:32.691 --> 11:33.776
You could do that.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.819
You think?

11:34.902 --> 11:38.531
Well, I mean, not to the level where if
somebody wants a fucking house built.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.699
Or if they want their whole house rewired

11:40.783 --> 11:43.244
or a fucking swimming pool
put in or whatever.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.245
Right.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.622
But say somebody's got a loose railing
on their deck

11:46.705 --> 11:49.625
or, you know, knocked a hole
in the wall and they need it patched.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.293
Who the fuck are they gonna call?

11:51.377 --> 11:54.755
Don't know, I do all that myself. Don't
know who the fuck you call for that shit.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.842
They'd call you, Ricky.
That's what I'm saying.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.051
They would call you!

11:59.135 --> 12:01.637
"Hey, Ricky, can you patch
this hole for me?"

12:01.720 --> 12:03.514
I get it. That's cool. Yeah.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.599
I think we can figure this out, Ricky.

12:05.683 --> 12:08.352
All right, you guys wait here.
Don't be cock-blocking me.

12:09.353 --> 12:10.521
Hey, how you doing?

12:10.604 --> 12:12.398
-Hi there!
-Hi, I'm Julian.

12:12.481 --> 12:15.317
Nice to meet you, Julian.
How can I help you?

12:15.401 --> 12:17.403
Well, your name would
be nice for starters.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.447
-My name's Heather.
-Heather. Holy shit,

12:19.530 --> 12:22.575
I love this outfit.
And your eyes are... beautiful.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.868
Thank you.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.953
Uh, I'm just looking
for a job application.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.372
You're not serious, are you?

12:28.456 --> 12:30.207
Oh yeah, I'm... I'm serious.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.334
I've always wanted to own a place
like this and...

12:32.418 --> 12:35.129
You know, I'm an entrepreneur,
so I've got to start somewhere, right?

12:35.212 --> 12:38.090
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Okay, well... I'll be right back, Julian.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.675
-Okay. All right.
-Just wait here.

12:39.758 --> 12:40.968
Okay, thanks, Heather.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.304
Fuck, that was easy.

12:46.390 --> 12:50.644
How much do you need to make,
realistically, every week to live, Ricky?

12:51.770 --> 12:54.523
Well, with Susan gone,
probably 50, 60 bucks a week.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.317
Just need enough money
for a bit of pepperoni,

12:56.400 --> 12:59.153
some chicken fingers... food, basically...
some dope and liquor.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.447
-There you go, 50, 60 bucks a week.
-Yeah.

13:01.530 --> 13:04.533
You could make that, no problem,
doing the odd, you know...

13:04.617 --> 13:07.953
cutting some boards,
putting up some drywall, whatever.

13:08.037 --> 13:11.248
I bet you'd have so much fucking work,
you couldn't even handle it.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.666
Well, I don't want too much work.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.877
I mean, that is one of my...
life rules, right?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.170
Not to work.

13:16.795 --> 13:20.633
I know, Ricky, but that's what I'm saying
about growing up, you know?

13:20.716 --> 13:21.926
It's time to grow up.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.803
You don't always get everything
exactly the way you want it.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.723
Sometimes you've just
got to bite the cock.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.018
You know what, Bubs?

13:31.477 --> 13:33.020
You're fucking right.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.648
It's time for me to suck some cock.

13:36.524 --> 13:40.236
No, that isn't...
that isn't at all what I said, Ricky.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.113
I meant bite it figuratively,

13:43.197 --> 13:45.032
not go out and start actually...

13:46.033 --> 13:47.243
doing it.

13:49.995 --> 13:50.913
Hmm...

13:50.996 --> 13:53.415
[background chatter]

14:01.340 --> 14:02.633
[pen clicking]

14:06.011 --> 14:07.054
[pen clattering]

14:09.807 --> 14:11.642
Stop fucking filming me!

14:12.685 --> 14:15.312
Okay, Ricky, this is gonna
be fucking awesome!

14:15.396 --> 14:17.439
Look at this,
put that one up, but...

14:17.523 --> 14:19.358
-Looks good.
-Give me another one.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.609
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.487
People don't know this, but the secret
to putting up flyers:

14:23.904 --> 14:26.115
you put two side by side.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.742
Fuck you, pork supper.
Look at this.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.287
Put two side by side.
It's scientifically proven.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.789
-Now that will get people's attention.
-Hey, fellas!

14:33.873 --> 14:36.208
Look at those two fucking cock ovens
wearing their fucking tool belts

14:36.292 --> 14:38.419
in the grocery store. Probably don't know
what the fuck they're doing.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.504
Got some fucking competition now,
you little dick mixers!

14:40.588 --> 14:41.922
Ricky, don't get cocky about it.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.967
If it isn't my two favourite dick pipes.
Get the fuck out of my way!

14:45.050 --> 14:47.177
-Go fuck yourself.
-What the hell are you guys doing here?

14:47.261 --> 14:49.138
Putting up flyers.
Rickey's got a new business.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.222
Oh!

14:50.306 --> 14:54.226
Oh! Look, I've got a little kind
of a fucking, uh, a towel rack thingy

14:54.310 --> 14:57.229
that I want put up in my bathroom.
Do you think you could do that?

14:57.313 --> 14:58.147
-Absolutely.
-A towel rack?

14:58.230 --> 15:00.399
-I can do that in about two minutes.
-How much?

15:00.482 --> 15:02.318
-A buck, buck 50, maybe?
-No, Ricky.

15:02.401 --> 15:06.113
No, it's... Look, if you look close at
the fine print, it's a ten dollar minimum,

15:06.196 --> 15:09.283
ten bucks an hour,
but guaranteed work.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.951
He does fucking great work.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.953
Okay then, sweetie, you got a deal.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.455
-Oh, my fuck. You know what?
-Oof!

15:14.538 --> 15:16.749
People like you are gonna keep me
the fuck out of jail! Thank you!

15:16.832 --> 15:18.459
Get off me, you big fucking oaf!

15:18.542 --> 15:20.502
You smell of weed and ass.
[shudders]

15:20.586 --> 15:23.881
Oh, and Bubba, I need some more
of that Green Bastard beer.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.758
-Okay.
-God, that stuff is delicious.

15:25.841 --> 15:30.763
And tonight is the finale
of Dancing With the Stars.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.599
-Okay...
-See you in a bit. Thanks.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.184
Did I just get my first fucking job?

15:35.267 --> 15:38.187
You just got it, Ricky!
You are officially in business, bud.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.897
I was fucking born to do this!

15:39.980 --> 15:41.315
[giggling]

15:41.732 --> 15:42.775
Decent!

15:43.150 --> 15:45.778
[announcer, indistinct
on loudspeaker]

15:45.861 --> 15:48.072
Look at this!
Randy, Randy...

15:48.572 --> 15:50.699
Go! Go! Go for it!
Go for it!

15:50.783 --> 15:52.076
-Yeah!
-[squealing]

15:52.159 --> 15:54.828
We won 25 bucks, Mr. Lahey!
We won!

15:54.912 --> 15:56.580
[slurring] Hey, that's
two in a row, Randy.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.499
So, buddy, I think...
you know what?

15:58.582 --> 16:00.209
I think I should have the next bet

16:00.292 --> 16:03.170
and I think we should take it up
a few notches, okay, bud?

16:03.253 --> 16:05.506
We shouldn't ruin our good luck streak,
Mr. Lahey.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.008
-Why not, Randy?
-Besides, I got a tingly feeling

16:08.092 --> 16:10.594
that Come From Behind's
gonna take the next one!

16:10.970 --> 16:12.304
Two bucks is another 25.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.973
Wait, wait, wait, wait, look!
Look!

16:15.265 --> 16:17.685
It's a sign, Randy, from the liquor.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.690
Hello! I'd like to pace a "blet",
as you say.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.233
Whoa, whoa!
Not allowed back here.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.818
[cameraman] Just fucking relax.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.237
On Topless Thunder!

16:28.320 --> 16:30.614
-Okay.
-That's a 20-to-1 odds, sir.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.907
Don't make that bet.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.409
Oh, Randy, don't be so ridiculous!

16:33.492 --> 16:35.536
This is a harbinger
from the Gods of Liquor!

16:35.619 --> 16:37.246
We can't fucking lose, bud.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.541
-How much would you like to bet?
-I'd like to bet 24,000.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.459
-No, Mr. Lahey!
-But Randy...

16:42.543 --> 16:44.294
-[indistinct shouting]
-Randy, for fuck's sake!

16:44.378 --> 16:47.464
Randy, stop it! Randy, you gotta bet big
if you wanna win big.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.591
Mr. Lahey, you just
made a big mistake!

16:49.675 --> 16:50.843
No, I didn't, Randy!

16:52.386 --> 16:55.848
Liquor never lies, bud,
as time will tell.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.474
What the frig...

16:57.599 --> 16:59.143
This is the best idea Bubbles ever had.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.270
I can't believe we never
thought of this before.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.522
Anyway, let's get this little
hand towel holder put up

17:03.605 --> 17:05.482
and we're the fuck out of here
in five minutes.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.526
These old homes are
always built to code,

17:07.608 --> 17:11.363
so their studs are every 16 inches,
so we'll just make a little mark here.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.494
Put a couple screws in this
and we're the fuck out of here!

17:18.579 --> 17:20.122
Ten bucks, just like that.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.042
[power drill whirring]

17:28.964 --> 17:31.300
[whirring, grinding]

17:31.383 --> 17:32.885
There we go. Perfect.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.055
Fucking seriously?

17:36.138 --> 17:39.475
Who the fuck built this piece of shit?
He was obviously fucking drunk.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.894
Fuckin' Jesus.
Where the fuck's the stud?

17:41.977 --> 17:43.562
[banging]

17:46.148 --> 17:48.692
Oh, for fuck's sakes.
Now I got a fucking hole here.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.194
Fucking asshole.

17:50.277 --> 17:52.154
You can patch
these little holes and...

17:52.237 --> 17:54.073
you know, they still
look pretty good, but...

17:54.698 --> 17:56.867
the best thing to do when you get
a hole like this is to...

17:56.950 --> 17:58.410
to make a little square.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.329
Then you'll never have
to worry about it cracking.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.872
May as well fucking do it right!

18:01.955 --> 18:04.374
So much for the goddamn
five-minute fucking job.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.584
But anyway...

18:06.001 --> 18:08.921
Fucking idiots that built
this fucking place. Fuck 'em.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.801
Cut a nice little rectangle out of here.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.807
Punch another couple
holes in the corner...

18:19.890 --> 18:21.016
[banging]

18:23.227 --> 18:24.520
All right.

18:25.562 --> 18:28.732
We take our trusty "I'll fucking cut
through anything" saw.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.569
And make sure you try
and stay on the lines,

18:32.653 --> 18:35.155
'cause you wanna be able
to replace a nice rectangle afterwards.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.240
[electric saw whirring]

18:37.574 --> 18:39.493
-[electrical buzzing]
-Oh, for fuck's sakes...

18:39.576 --> 18:43.163
[Marguerite] What the fuck is going on
in there? My goddamn TV just went out.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.416
Chill the fuck out, Marguerite.
It's probably just a breaker, no big deal.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.168
-I'll fix it.
-[Marguerite] Ricky?

18:48.252 --> 18:49.962
[electric saw whirring, rattling]

18:50.045 --> 18:52.047
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Oh, fuck!

18:52.131 --> 18:53.465
[hiss of spraying water]

18:53.966 --> 18:55.467
[Marguerite] What the hell was that?

18:55.551 --> 18:58.804
[thudding, ripping, clattering]

18:58.887 --> 19:00.514
-[Marguerite] Ahh!
-Fuck, fuck!

19:00.597 --> 19:02.224
[Marguerite]
Where is this water coming from?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.017
My TV is still off!

19:04.101 --> 19:07.312
Right in the middle of my show, you...
you cock-sucking idiot!

19:07.980 --> 19:09.398
Oh, I'm gonna kill you!

19:09.481 --> 19:10.899
-[clattering]
-[Ricky] Fuck!

19:10.983 --> 19:12.985
-[Marguerite] What the hell was that?
-Dammit!

19:13.777 --> 19:14.903
[shouting] Fuck!

19:18.323 --> 19:20.284
[Marguerite] Where is this water
coming from?

19:20.367 --> 19:21.493
[Ricky] Get the fuck in here!

19:22.870 --> 19:24.997
-Fuck...
-[clattering]

19:26.790 --> 19:28.667
[Marguerite]
What the doubling heck?

19:28.750 --> 19:30.377
Yee!

19:30.460 --> 19:32.796
I'm up to my fucking ankles
in water out here!

19:32.880 --> 19:34.506
What the...
And my TV's still off!

19:34.590 --> 19:36.550
-Fuck you!
-[Marguerite] What's going on?

19:36.758 --> 19:38.051
[water spraying]

19:39.970 --> 19:42.681
Marguerite, you've got to shut
your fucking water off!

19:42.764 --> 19:44.600
Shut your fucking water off!

19:45.267 --> 19:47.227
-[Marguerite] What the fuck?
-Ahh!

19:47.311 --> 19:48.770
[water spraying]

19:50.189 --> 19:53.817
[indistinct background chatter]

20:07.206 --> 20:09.166
Excuse me, sir.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.585
-What?
-Come with us, please.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.753
Why?

20:12.836 --> 20:14.922
[guard]
Just gonna have a little talk.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.925
Here he is, sir.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.511
Great. Nice work, guys, thanks.
I'll take it from here.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.598
Nice work, you're fucking
superheroes. Nice. Good going.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.642
-Look, I didn't do anything wrong.
-Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

20:27.351 --> 20:30.062
You see, the thing is...
They have this new stuff.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.147
-It's called, uh, security cameras.
-Mm-hmm.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.566
They get your good side here,
don't you think? As you're reaching

20:34.650 --> 20:37.653
into this guy's pocket to steal that
wallet, right there in plain sight,

20:37.736 --> 20:39.738
the footage not lying?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.448
[Julian] Is that it?

20:42.074 --> 20:43.867
Is that it?
What do you mean, is that it?

20:43.951 --> 20:45.535
Me taking a wallet?

20:45.619 --> 20:47.079
-Yeah.
-[Julian scoffs]

20:47.162 --> 20:51.667
Look. Before I thought I'd apply
for this fucking job here...

20:51.750 --> 20:53.293
-[objects clattering]
-I thought that I would, uh,

20:53.377 --> 20:56.505
do a little test on the security,
and guess what I found out?

20:56.588 --> 20:59.007
It sucks shit!
So bad I don't think

20:59.091 --> 21:01.218
I could even fucking work here,
which is unfortunate for you

21:01.301 --> 21:03.929
'cause you could really
use a guy like me, a professional.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.347
Anyway, I thank you for your time.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.932
No, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.892
Let's... let's talk?

21:09.059 --> 21:11.019
Oh. I already have this fucking...

21:11.103 --> 21:13.480
They want me to work over
in this mall in Halifax, okay?

21:13.563 --> 21:15.148
Basically doing
the same thing you're doing:

21:15.232 --> 21:17.985
staring at monitors,
being the big boss man, eating shit,

21:18.068 --> 21:20.696
smoking fucking cigarettes
all day. But that's not me.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.615
You know, I'm the kind of guy
that likes to be out in the field,

21:23.699 --> 21:26.785
taking the bad guys down and putting
them away, making myself feel good.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.120
And just between you and I,

21:28.203 --> 21:31.498
I'm a reformed criminal gone good
and I've made it my life's mission

21:31.581 --> 21:34.293
to put the bad guys down and in jail.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.503
Wish I could've helped you out, man.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.298
W-w-w-w-wait, wait, wait.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.509
[sighing] I'm sorry, okay.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.136
I-I didn't mean to accuse you.

21:44.219 --> 21:47.222
It's just I'm under a lot of stress
and pressure here, right.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.559
I got kids in the food court
throwing subs at me all the time.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.644
I've just been back from
the ashram six months.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.063
Six months and I've already
gained all the weight back,

21:55.147 --> 21:56.898
my wife has moved
into the spare room,

21:56.982 --> 21:58.191
I can't quit smoking,

21:58.275 --> 21:59.776
I got Tweedledum
and Tweedle-dumber

21:59.860 --> 22:02.821
out there with the walkies all day
going, "Gary, come to the food court!"

22:02.904 --> 22:04.239
"Gary, come to administration!"

22:04.323 --> 22:06.783
"Gary, come here!
Gary, come here! Gary, come here!"

22:06.867 --> 22:07.909
Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary!

22:07.993 --> 22:10.537
I can take care
of all of that for you, man.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.498
All of it. I can even help you
get off the fucking butts.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.500
No problem, I'm your fucking guy.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.212
H... h-how?

22:19.296 --> 22:21.340
How do we make that work?

22:22.424 --> 22:24.509
Twenty bucks an hour,
Monday to Friday,

22:24.593 --> 22:26.928
I'm second in command, and when
I am working, I work alone.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.765
You can fucking put those
twat waffles on the weekend.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.516
That's it.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.562
-Come over here, you stupid bastard.
-Fuck off, Marguerite!

22:35.645 --> 22:37.522
-[Marguerite shouting]
-[Bubbles] What the fuck is going on?

22:37.606 --> 22:40.776
-I'm trying to deal with this! Fuck off!
-What the fuck is going on?

22:40.859 --> 22:43.695
-Christ! What is going on?
-Hit me with that fucking broom again,

22:43.779 --> 22:45.947
-I dare you.
-This cock-sucking anti-Christer

22:46.031 --> 22:48.867
son of a bitch has totally trashed
my fucking bathroom!

22:48.950 --> 22:50.452
That's what's happened?
Oh, yeah!

22:50.535 --> 22:53.497
-What are you talking about?
-Be my guest. Go in and take a look!

22:53.580 --> 22:55.332
-Ricky, what did you do?
-Wasn't my fucking fault.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.209
-I nicked the water pipe...
-Oh, Ricky!

22:57.292 --> 22:59.252
Things got a little more complicated.
But I'm going to...

22:59.336 --> 23:00.670
Don't tell me there's water damage,
Ricky!

23:00.754 --> 23:01.797
[Marguerite] Fucking idiot.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.965
Oh, my... Holy fuck!

23:04.257 --> 23:06.218
[Marguerite] Ha! Ha! Grand, isn't it?

23:06.301 --> 23:08.720
Ricky, oh, my God!
Are you joking?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.514
Like I said, it's a little more
complicated now,

23:10.597 --> 23:12.933
-but it's not a big deal...
-Ricky, the bathtub and the toilet,

23:13.016 --> 23:14.559
they're in the kitchen!
Are you kidding me?

23:14.643 --> 23:17.229
Well, they had to go somewhere!
They're not gonna fucking stay here.

23:17.312 --> 23:20.065
It's gonna get dealt with.
So everyone calm the fuck down!

23:20.148 --> 23:21.733
Okay, Marguerite. This is...

23:21.817 --> 23:24.528
This is a major fucking problem, Ricky.

23:24.611 --> 23:26.530
[Ricky]
It's really not as bad as it looks. Okay?

23:26.613 --> 23:30.617
[Bubbles] Oh, my Jesus...
sweet Murphy's tits!

23:30.700 --> 23:33.120
Well, when some fucking idiot
decides to put a stud... like...

23:33.203 --> 23:35.747
it's not 16 fucking inches,
and then they're running pipes

23:35.831 --> 23:38.333
and shit up... What, do they need water up
in the fucking attic?

23:38.416 --> 23:39.334
These people are dumb!

23:39.417 --> 23:41.336
I couldn't find the leak,
so I'm tracing the sink.

23:41.419 --> 23:43.797
Think it would be under the sink.
No! Rip the fucking sink out.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.342
No! It goes around to the fucking tub.
So I rip that out. And under the toilet.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.761
Everything had to fucking come out
in order to fix this properly.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.680
Who the fuck runs fucking pipes...?

23:51.763 --> 23:52.973
[Bubbles] Ricky!

23:53.056 --> 23:55.058
I swear, I'll fix that too.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.478
Who the fuck runs pipes
up here like this?

23:58.562 --> 24:00.981
Oh, my Jesus, Ricky.
Look, Marguerite, calm...

24:01.064 --> 24:02.816
He keeps saying it's not his fault.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.025
-It's not!
-Well, I'm telling you...

24:04.109 --> 24:08.697
Suppose I call the police and we let
them sort out whose fucking fault it is?

24:08.780 --> 24:12.033
Look, Marguerite, I know you're wild,
dear, I know you're wild.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.618
-Yeah.
-I'm gonna give you

24:13.702 --> 24:16.037
two cases of beer right off the bat.
Free.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.497
-Oh...!
-To calm your nerves.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.166
And when I start to drink all that,

24:19.249 --> 24:21.585
where do you suppose
I'm going to piss?

24:21.668 --> 24:23.962
-That's a good point.
-Listen to me right now.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.964
This bathroom looked like shit
when I started.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.842
The little towel rack would have
made it look better, yes, I admit that.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.511
Now it's fucked. I'll fix the whole
thing, I'll do it right,

24:31.595 --> 24:33.805
not like the fuckhead that built this
that didn't do it right.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.807
I'll do it right for 200 bucks.
Brand new bathroom.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.851
200 bucks!
Ricky, what are you talking about?

24:37.934 --> 24:38.894
It's a good deal.

24:38.977 --> 24:43.023
Let me tell you, when all
of that phantasmic work is done,

24:43.106 --> 24:46.318
you can go fucking whistle
for your 200 bucks!

24:46.526 --> 24:49.029
-Fucking loser.
-Just try and stay calm, Marguerite.

24:49.112 --> 24:50.822
-Take a deep breath...
-Hate that fucking guy.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.116
-I'm going to kill him!
-I can't fucking believe, Ricky,

24:53.200 --> 24:55.577
that this started
with a goddamn towel rack!

24:55.660 --> 24:56.912
I know, right?

24:57.329 --> 25:01.041
Anyway, do you think she's gonna
be cool with pissing in a bucket?

25:01.124 --> 25:03.543
She can't piss in a bucket!
She's 82!

25:04.961 --> 25:06.296
Will she piss outside?

25:06.379 --> 25:08.882
Ricky, you figure out
where she's pissing.

25:08.965 --> 25:11.843
She's not pissing outside
like a fucking wild animal.

25:11.927 --> 25:15.472
Well, she might have to piss in your shed
for a few days. I'll let her know. Thanks.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.350
Marguerite? You can piss at Bubbles'
for the next few days.

25:18.433 --> 25:20.018
Uhhh, buh, buh,
buh, buh, buh!

25:22.020 --> 25:23.855
[whistling]

25:24.814 --> 25:26.316
[clattering]

25:27.901 --> 25:29.027
[handle rattling]

25:31.404 --> 25:32.572
Randy.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.325
Hey, Randy, open the door,
the door's locked.

25:36.952 --> 25:40.580
You went too far this time, sir.
You can sleep outside.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.249
Randy...

25:42.332 --> 25:43.667
Hey, listen, Randy,
Randy, Randy!

25:43.750 --> 25:45.877
I-I admit that I...

25:45.961 --> 25:47.921
[slurring] I made a mistake, bud.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.965
I shouldn't have been
listening to the liquor.

25:50.382 --> 25:54.177
It's proof enough, shit, that liquor
doesn't know shit about horses!

25:55.136 --> 25:56.596
Look, Randy.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.766
I don't wanna fight with you, bud,
just open up the door.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.018
Randy, I'll tell you what.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.770
Let me in and...

26:04.396 --> 26:07.440
I'll let you take care
of the money from now on.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.277
You promise, sir?

26:10.360 --> 26:13.196
Yeah, I promise. Cross my heart
and hope to die, Randers.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.031
-All the money?
-All the money.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.241
All of it?

26:16.491 --> 26:17.993
You can take care of it.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.619
And I'll tell you what else I'll do.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.163
I'll give you a nice little
foot massage, Randers.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.415
And I'll, uh...

26:23.498 --> 26:25.208
I'll clean out your belly button

26:25.292 --> 26:28.420
with a nice, soft toothbrush
and some lavender.

26:28.753 --> 26:29.879
[lock clicking]

26:33.049 --> 26:34.884
-Thanks, Randy.
-Okay, Mr. Lahey.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.012
Boop, boop!

26:37.429 --> 26:38.471
[giggling]

26:38.555 --> 26:42.892
Ricky, Mike fucking Holmes couldn't
redo that bathroom for 200 bucks.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.145
-Like, what are you thinking?
-You don't understand, man.

26:45.228 --> 26:47.605
My head's got it mapped out in a way
that I'm still going to come

26:47.689 --> 26:51.151
out of this with 150 bucks profit!
Need to steal a few fucking supplies.

26:51.234 --> 26:54.529
-That's not a bad day's work.
-Ricky! Listen to yourself though.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.573
The whole point of you getting
into business for yourself

26:56.656 --> 26:58.908
is so that you don't have
to break the law anymore.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.076
I'm not.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.038
You just said you're
gonna steal supplies.

27:03.121 --> 27:06.875
Like, stealing is not allowed anymore,
Ricky, that's what I'm saying.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.501
If you wanna turn
your life around,

27:08.585 --> 27:11.338
you make an honest living
being your own boss.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.923
-That's how you do it.
-Boys, check it out!

27:14.007 --> 27:15.717
I got a job at the mall.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.387
I just put in a four-hour shift.
I fucking loved it, man. It was awesome!

27:19.471 --> 27:21.639
A job at the mall?
Doing what?

27:22.182 --> 27:24.392
Oh, Ricky, come on. It's... Look.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.187
He's a cashier, Ricky.

27:27.270 --> 27:29.022
-[giggling]
-I'm a security man.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.482
-That's amazing!
-Yeah, man.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.026
You've got a real job.
You're a working man!

27:33.109 --> 27:36.404
-[Julian] Damn rights, buddy.
-Unbelievable. I'm proud of you, Julian.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.073
I'm very proud of you.

27:38.615 --> 27:39.991
Very proud. Ricky...

27:40.075 --> 27:41.993
Ricky got a legit job today too.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.662
No way. Doing what, carpentry?

27:45.038 --> 27:46.664
How the fuck did you know that?

27:46.998 --> 27:48.333
Ricky, I'm proud of you too.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.001
-Get in here.
-Get over here, man.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.669
-Get in here!
-Are you kidding me?

27:51.753 --> 27:53.671
-Huggie wuggies time.
-All right, buddy!

27:53.755 --> 27:55.507
[Cory] Aw, dudes,
I love hugs!

27:55.965 --> 27:57.217
Look, man.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.968
Fucking hero, dude,
I found one.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.137
But the rest are all broken.
What should I do?

28:01.221 --> 28:02.972
Maybe, Cory, maybe
you should go down

28:03.056 --> 28:05.433
and fucking ram them
in your stupid piss-hole.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.310
-[Ricky laughing]
-Why don't you do that?

28:07.977 --> 28:10.855
Cory, go clean up
the fucking bottles! Go!

28:10.939 --> 28:13.358
Don't ruin beautiful moments, Cory!

28:13.733 --> 28:15.318
Fuck's sakes!

28:16.194 --> 28:17.862
[sighing] Get back in here!

28:17.946 --> 28:19.739
I'm not giving up on my hugs.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.282
-[giggling]
-Right on, boys.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.993
My two best friends
making an honest living.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.620
Right, Ricky?

28:25.703 --> 28:27.539
-Right, Bubs.
-Honest.

28:27.622 --> 28:30.250
-Right on, man.
-Boys... if I was a kitty,

28:30.333 --> 28:33.711
you guys'd both need earplugs right now,
I'd be purring so loud!

28:34.003 --> 28:35.255
[giggling]

28:35.338 --> 28:37.173
[purring]

28:37.924 --> 28:41.553

29:21.426 --> 29:24.095

29:35.607 --> 29:40.862
[fish] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

29:40.945 --> 29:43.698
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

29:46.659 --> 29:48.036
[whispering]
Fuck.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.330
