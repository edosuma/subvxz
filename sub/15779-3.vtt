WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.710
All right, come on.

00:04.170 --> 00:05.500
Come--

00:05.630 --> 00:08.710
Damn it, White! How many times
do I have to tell you about refilling the roll?

00:08.840 --> 00:09.960
Huh?

00:10.090 --> 00:13.550
I can-- Am I too short? I can't reach it.

00:14.220 --> 00:15.300
Oh, god!

00:22.600 --> 00:24.440
And welcome...

00:25.650 --> 00:27.150
You are not...

00:27.270 --> 00:29.610
superhuman.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.990
Whi--
White, White, White!

00:34.110 --> 00:35.400
White, get in here!

00:35.530 --> 00:37.450
Billy, I don't care how big it is...

00:37.570 --> 00:39.490
I don't want to see
what you made in there.

00:39.620 --> 00:40.990
White, I just remembered something.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.000
- What?
- Everything.

00:43.660 --> 00:45.910
It all came flooding back to me
like a tidal wave...

00:46.040 --> 00:47.580
things that happened years ago.

00:47.710 --> 00:50.840
I fell off the toilet, and suddenly
my hand started doing this weird st--

00:50.960 --> 00:51.960
Wait a minute.

00:52.090 --> 00:53.340
You! You were there, too!

00:57.260 --> 00:59.510
Hello, Goldilocks?
This is Casper.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.600
Little Nemo has fallen out of bed.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074

01:35.970 --> 01:39.220
Hello, and welcome to "Quizboys"!

01:41.390 --> 01:43.350
I'm your host, the ever-popular Pete White.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.640
Let's jump right in and meet
today's contestants, shall we?

01:46.770 --> 01:51.310
He's our reigning champion, who's won
over $40,000 in cash and prizes so far.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.980
- Say hello to Master Billy Whalen.
- Hi, Mr. White.

01:55.110 --> 01:57.320
So, what are you gonna
do with all that money, Billy?

01:57.450 --> 01:59.990
Well, I'm hoping
to save it for college tuition.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.740
Any idea where you want to go yet?

02:01.870 --> 02:03.870
Yes, sir!
M.I.T.

02:03.990 --> 02:06.700
I'm gonna be a superscientist
when I grow up...

02:06.830 --> 02:09.160
just like my hero,
Rusty Venture.

02:09.289 --> 02:10.750
Well, that's quite...

02:10.880 --> 02:11.790
Barkeep!

02:11.920 --> 02:14.500
Another Suffering Bastard.
Whoa!

02:14.630 --> 02:17.170
Yello?

02:17.300 --> 02:18.510
There you are.

02:18.630 --> 02:19.840
How could you just leave like that...

02:19.970 --> 02:21.510
without telling me where
you were going?

02:21.640 --> 02:23.800
Look, you're not my mother.
You're my bodyguard.

02:23.930 --> 02:26.220
How can I guard your body
if I can't be close to your body?

02:26.350 --> 02:31.190
Good god.
Barkeep, where's that Suffering Bastard?!

02:31.310 --> 02:34.150
- I'm looking at him.
- Oh, ha ha ha.

02:34.270 --> 02:37.440
OK, contestants, pens down.
Time's up.

02:37.570 --> 02:42.320
The question was, "Who was
the last king of the Plantagenet dynasty?"

02:42.450 --> 02:43.990
Todd, your answer.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.200
Richard III.

02:46.330 --> 02:47.540
That's correct.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.960
OK, Billy, you get this answer right...

02:50.080 --> 02:54.170
you'll remain "Quizboys"
champion and return next week.

02:54.290 --> 02:56.040
For all the marbles...

02:56.170 --> 02:58.130
what's your answer?

02:58.260 --> 02:59.300
That's right!

02:59.420 --> 03:00.720
You win!
You're still...

03:00.840 --> 03:03.300
Hey, he cheated!
That's not what he wrote!

03:03.430 --> 03:05.640
Now, Todd, let's not be a sore loser.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.890
I'm not!
That isn't what he wrote!

03:08.020 --> 03:10.730
He's a cheater!
Cheater!

03:10.850 --> 03:12.730
Cheater!

03:12.850 --> 03:15.560
Cheater.
Todd's the little cheater, I'll tell you that.

03:15.690 --> 03:18.940
How's he gonna know what you wrote
if he wasn't peeking at your answers?

03:19.070 --> 03:22.150
I'm done!
My life is over!

03:22.280 --> 03:23.780
I'll never quiz again!

03:23.910 --> 03:24.990
Forget M.I.T. now.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.950
Aah!
I never asked for the answers.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.330
I didn't want to cheat.
You did this to me.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.040
Hey, hey. Let's not make me out
to be the bad guy here, huh?

03:34.170 --> 03:36.630
- Us freaks have to stick together.
- Us freaks?

03:36.750 --> 03:39.710
Yeah, like, fun.
A handsome TV guy like you...

03:39.840 --> 03:41.840
you'll probably end up
with a talk show out of this.

03:41.970 --> 03:43.880
No, Billy.
You see...

03:44.930 --> 03:46.220
I'm a freak, too.

03:48.390 --> 03:51.310
Well, some of us can't make
our heads smaller with makeup, OK?

03:51.430 --> 03:54.140
Look, you said Rusty Venture
was your hero, right?

03:54.270 --> 03:55.270
And how?

03:55.400 --> 03:58.020
Well, I happen to be
very good friends with him.

03:58.150 --> 04:03.320
I am, and he told me that he's about
to start a huge new project.

04:03.450 --> 04:08.490
And he needs a new head scientist
and a new lab assistant.

04:08.620 --> 04:09.990
But-- but-- but
what about my schooling?

04:10.120 --> 04:12.250
Experience is the best
teacher, Billy.

04:12.370 --> 04:14.830
This is better than going
to 1 0 M.I.T.s.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.380
The invisible hand of fate has
pushed us to this point, Billy.

04:18.500 --> 04:22.510
Our destiny lies with Dr. Rusty Venture.

04:22.630 --> 04:26.300
- You think he would have me?
- I told you I got an in.

04:26.430 --> 04:29.430
We just need to get out to his lab,
and I'll take care of the rest.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.060
Now, you got all that prize
money, right?

04:31.180 --> 04:33.810
No, I don't.
The F.C.C. froze my assets.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.440
Yeah, and I pissed away
most of my savings on blow...

04:36.560 --> 04:40.150
but I've got a brand-new set of wheels,
and I think I just might know...

04:40.280 --> 04:43.030
how we can earn
some gas money along the way.

his little friend the Hulk.

05:32.490 --> 05:36.580
Didn't notice you ladies
out there in the battlefield, as usual.

05:36.710 --> 05:39.880
That's because we're doing
real spy work, Shore Leave.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.540
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

05:41.670 --> 05:45.760
You're too busy chasing some
phantom costume terrorist organization...

05:45.880 --> 05:47.880
to help us fight
the real enemies of freedom--

05:48.010 --> 05:48.880
Sphinx.

05:49.010 --> 05:50.390
Yo S.I.!

05:50.510 --> 05:53.640
We'll prove the Guild is still around,
and we'll take them down without you.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.220
- Just you wait!
- I won't hold my breath.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.520
Let's hit the showers, fellas!
Whoo!

05:58.640 --> 06:01.730
Yo S.I.! Yo S.I.! Yo S.I.!

06:01.860 --> 06:03.900
Oh, Hunter,
Wayland Flowers called.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.400
He wants his madame back.
Boom!

06:06.530 --> 06:08.240
Oh, yeah?
Well, the Village People called...

06:08.360 --> 06:11.910
and they want you to go fucking
kill yourselves, you pansy bastards!

06:12.030 --> 06:15.040
Place has gone to hell in a ham sandwich
since they eighty-sixed the dress code.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.910
Those fellas razzing you?

06:17.040 --> 06:19.000
You want me to say something to them?

06:19.120 --> 06:20.920
- No, we got it covered, Red.
- Ha ha.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.630
Adiós, muchachos.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.550
Oh, you hear they're
gonna ban smoking in here soon?

06:25.670 --> 06:26.960
Hmm, let the swines try it.

06:27.090 --> 06:30.630
Colonel Gathers, this just came in
over the telex for you guys.

06:32.140 --> 06:33.760
We got one.

06:33.890 --> 06:37.310
I've only heard about these.
I didn't know they were real.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.480
Oh, this is as real as it gets, Billy.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.270
No lightning rounds, no bonus
questions, no mercy.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.940
You're going down, Whalen.

06:45.070 --> 06:48.240
Don't even think about pulling
any of that cheating crap in here.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.360
Yeah. Yeah, you know what they do
if they catch you cheating, don't you?

06:51.490 --> 06:52.780
They take one of your hands--

06:52.910 --> 06:55.660
your buzzer hand.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.240
W-White-- White,
I can't do this.

06:57.370 --> 06:58.700
Oh, yes, you can, fella.

06:58.830 --> 07:03.500
I've seen a lot of quiz boys come and go,
and you are by far the best I've ever seen.

07:03.630 --> 07:08.050
You were put on this Earth
for one purpose, Billy, to quiz.

07:08.170 --> 07:11.300
Now, I robbed you of that
purpose once, and I'm sorry.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.090
Will you let me make it up to you?

07:13.220 --> 07:16.300
Stage moms,
clear the arena.

07:16.430 --> 07:20.980
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiz boys and girls...

07:21.100 --> 07:24.980
Welcome to the quiz doom.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.940
"Jeopardy!" rules apply--
answers in the form of a question.

07:28.070 --> 07:30.900
You have five seconds after buzzing.
Winner take all.

07:31.030 --> 07:33.200
And first question:

07:33.320 --> 07:34.990
in 121 5...

07:35.120 --> 07:36.700
Billy Whalen.

07:36.830 --> 07:39.870
- What is the Magna Carta?
- Correct!

07:56.140 --> 07:58.390
Cows on my side.
That's 6-2, me.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.770
Monster!
I'll catch you yet.

08:00.890 --> 08:02.520
Show yourselves, you cowards!

08:02.640 --> 08:06.230
This is a farm belt.
Let's see some action on this side!

08:06.360 --> 08:09.860
- Cows on my side.
- Unconscionable bastards.

08:09.980 --> 08:13.400
Oh! Oh! Cemetery!
You lose all your cows.

08:13.990 --> 08:17.820
Damn it, this side's cursed.
Your turn to drive, you lurid golem.

08:18.410 --> 08:22.330
This is it, Billy.
Our new life is calling.

08:22.460 --> 08:26.790
Mr. White, how can I ever begin to repay
you for-- what-- what's going on?

08:26.920 --> 08:28.880
...touch me, don't touch me,
don't touch me!

08:29.000 --> 08:32.510
Ya-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!

08:32.630 --> 08:38.350
Aah!

08:40.260 --> 08:42.809
It's OK, H.E.L.P.eR.
She's gone now.

08:42.929 --> 08:45.940
- What's goin' on, Rust?
- What the hell are you doing here?

08:46.060 --> 08:47.480
"All staffed up.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.520
"Try back in a few months.

08:49.650 --> 08:51.270
"Never much good at science any--"

08:51.400 --> 08:52.860
Who does he think he is?

08:52.990 --> 08:55.820
My life is over.
I have no prospects.

08:55.950 --> 08:58.370
And my boyhood hero
is a total dick.

08:58.490 --> 09:00.410
All right, just don't you worry, fella.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.240
The pink pilgrim's gotten you this far.

09:02.370 --> 09:04.540
I'm not gonna leave you hanging
when the chips are down.

09:04.660 --> 09:08.120
In fact, I've already lined up another quiz.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.380
This doesn't look
like the usual quiz crowd.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.340
Yeah, well, I guess
we're close to the border...

09:14.470 --> 09:16.220
but the game's still the same.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.510
You get in there and work
the old magic, huh?

09:19.050 --> 09:22.220
Listos, a pelear!

09:23.770 --> 09:24.850
Aah!

09:25.890 --> 09:28.100
I didn't know, Billy, I swear.

09:28.230 --> 09:30.060
I'm finished with this, finished.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.440
Just give me my 40% and let me off.

09:32.570 --> 09:34.610
Uh, there is no money.

09:34.740 --> 09:38.780
I-I bet our whole wad, and, well,
let's be honest here, Billy, you did lose.

09:38.910 --> 09:42.200
I was disqualified
because you jumped in the ring.

09:42.330 --> 09:43.580
To get your hand.

09:43.700 --> 09:47.410
Stop the moped.
Stop this thing right now.

09:47.540 --> 09:51.460
Billy, there's coyotes out here.
You want to lose your other hand?

09:51.590 --> 09:55.130
It would be safer than spending
one more minute with you.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.550
You brought me nothing but
trouble since I met you.

09:58.680 --> 10:02.010
I never want to see you again.

10:03.930 --> 10:08.060
Oh, by the way,
I talked to the other quiz boys.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.770
Managers get 1 5%!

10:16.530 --> 10:19.240
Son, you look like you could
use a hand.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.070
Yello?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.660
Rust, it's White.
Let me in, I--

10:24.790 --> 10:26.870
Venture residence.

10:27.000 --> 10:27.950
Hey, Rust, let me in.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.000
I need to see Bro--

10:29.120 --> 10:31.250
Whom shall I say is calling?

10:31.380 --> 10:33.170
Come on, Rust, don't be a dick.

10:38.130 --> 10:40.680
Please do not be alarmed.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.680
We are about to engage...

10:43.800 --> 10:45.930
the nozzle.

10:46.770 --> 10:50.480
Please do not move while
the nozzle is engaging.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.230
Moving will disrupt calibration of...

10:53.360 --> 10:55.150
the nozzle.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.030
Please wait while we calibrate...

10:59.150 --> 11:00.820
the nozzle.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.200
Please do not look away from...

11:04.330 --> 11:06.160
the nozzle.

11:07.330 --> 11:12.000
The nozzle is now calibrating.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.580
The nozzle is still calibrating.

11:16.130 --> 11:18.960
The nozzle has completed calibration.

11:19.090 --> 11:20.220
Thank you.

11:20.340 --> 11:22.510
There's our pink-cheeked
junior G-man.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.640
What was that thing?

11:23.760 --> 11:26.470
I have no idea.
Standard, uh...

11:26.600 --> 11:28.100
How do you like your new body buddies?

11:28.220 --> 11:32.980
Amazing. You-- you totally fixed
everything, but I-I'm still a little confused.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.400
I mean, why me?

11:34.520 --> 11:35.810
You fit the profile.

11:35.940 --> 11:37.570
Deformed, disgraced.

11:37.690 --> 11:40.530
An extra-intelligent superfreak
shunned by an unforgiving world.

11:40.650 --> 11:43.070
Yeah, that sounds like a profile
for, like, suicide.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.410
Or an international supervillain.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.910
We've been investigating
a university professor...

11:48.040 --> 11:49.910
we believe is secretly a major recruiter...

11:50.040 --> 11:51.910
for a global underground
crime syndicate.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.580
Drumroll.
The Guild of Calamitous Intent.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.050
From the old Rusty Venture TV show?

11:59.170 --> 12:01.090
You see? You see?!

12:01.220 --> 12:03.300
Well, that's just a dramatiz-iz-iza--

12:03.430 --> 12:04.550
Dramatization.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.470
Yeah, the real Guild is still out there
operating in secret-- we think.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.270
And this professor is the key.

12:11.390 --> 12:12.930
Check out his cuff links.

12:13.060 --> 12:16.600
So-- so, you, what, you want me
to assassinate this guy or something?

12:16.730 --> 12:18.980
No. We want you to ace his class.

12:19.110 --> 12:20.440
Congratulations, lad.

12:20.570 --> 12:23.280
You're now a fully matriculated
student of State University.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.030
Oh. I-I kind
of wanted to go to M.I.T.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.700
And I wanted to be born
with big, beautiful tits!

12:28.830 --> 12:33.040
Make some lemonade with this, will ya?

12:33.160 --> 12:35.580
Ah, young Mr. Whalen.

12:35.710 --> 12:37.750
Do find a seat quickly, Quizboy.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.130
I was starting to teach your
more punctual peers.

12:40.250 --> 12:44.130
Sorry, Professor Fantomos.
I had trouble finding the building.

12:44.260 --> 12:48.090
Yes, yes.
It's a great big, new world for you.

12:48.220 --> 12:50.930
And, Mr. Quizboy, I heard you
were recently exonerated...

12:51.060 --> 12:52.970
but allow me to impress one
thing upon you--

12:53.100 --> 12:56.480
we do not tolerate
cheating at State University.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.020
The punishment is severe.

12:59.150 --> 13:01.360
Professor Fantomos,
you're needed in the office.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.780
Ah, well, if you'll excuse me, class.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.200
Stevie, would you please take
over the lecture for me?

13:06.320 --> 13:08.200
Kessler's, chapter four.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.080
And, students, I expect those
papers on my desk...

13:11.200 --> 13:13.790
at the start of the next class.

13:13.910 --> 13:17.000
OK, guys, uh, page 72.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.130
Um, we're learning...

13:21.130 --> 13:26.970
♪ Suddenly,
I'm not so different ♪

13:27.090 --> 13:33.850
♪ Suddenly,
I'm not so all alone ♪

13:33.970 --> 13:36.480
♪ Suddenly, I'm-- ♪

13:44.530 --> 13:46.820
Hmm, wonder if it's the same Stevie.

13:48.530 --> 13:49.530
Oh! Ge--

13:51.160 --> 13:53.240
Get ahold of yourself
and stop hyperventilating!

13:53.370 --> 13:54.870
This is a small car god damn it.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.410
Just keep your cool
and don't blow the mission.

13:57.540 --> 13:59.120
We're getting excellent intel out of you.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.250
What intel?
I've-- I've been here for a day.

14:01.380 --> 14:02.630
I haven't done any spying yet.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.590
Sure, you have.
That new eye of yours--

14:04.710 --> 14:07.420
actually a 3-D laser matrix
holographic camera.

14:07.550 --> 14:09.550
And this little pud puller
stores all the data.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.890
What?
You guys wired me?

14:11.010 --> 14:14.060
Are you kidding?
You're a walking wire, and right now...

14:14.180 --> 14:16.720
you need to walk back in there
and do your god-given duty.

14:16.850 --> 14:19.230
There are no free hands
in this business, son.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.900
Ehm--
I'm sorry, Sheila...

14:24.020 --> 14:27.240
but if I extend the deadline
for one student...

14:27.360 --> 14:29.650
I'd have to extend it
for all of them.

14:29.780 --> 14:32.820
Well, thank you, anyway,
Professor Fantomos.

14:32.950 --> 14:35.580
Mr. Whalen, thank you for coming.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.330
Professor Fantomos,
if this is about my paper, I'm really sorry.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.170
We'll get to that, but first I wanted
to see how you were holding up...

14:41.290 --> 14:44.090
and extend my deepest
condolences about Stevie.

14:44.210 --> 14:46.090
Oh, I'm the one who should be sorry.

14:46.210 --> 14:49.420
I understand he was your lab
assistant for some time?

14:49.550 --> 14:51.840
Yes, he was
quite a clever boy--

14:51.970 --> 14:58.680
regrettable, which brings us
to the other reason I asked you here.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.020
My paper.
You see--

15:00.140 --> 15:04.440
I'll be needing a new lab assistant,
and I'd like him to be you.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.820
Me? Oh-- oh-- oh,
I-I don't think I'm ready.

15:07.940 --> 15:11.360
Nonsense! I read your paper.
It was brilliant, perfect.

15:11.490 --> 15:14.280
Frankly, I think my class
may be beneath you.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.910
And this ingenious contraption
you've built--

15:17.040 --> 15:19.830
based on a Mike Sariamo design,
is it not?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.920
He was a student of mine, you know.

15:22.750 --> 15:26.500
Ah, the brightest mind I've ever
taught-- until now.

15:26.630 --> 15:29.010
There's something you should
know, William.

15:29.130 --> 15:32.340
Like you, I was born...
different.

15:32.470 --> 15:34.800
Yes, my family rejected me...

15:34.930 --> 15:38.810
the last son in a long line
of costumed adventurers.

15:38.930 --> 15:41.390
Clearly, I couldn't take
on the mantle of my forebears...

15:41.520 --> 15:46.770
with this body, so I instead
turned to science.

15:46.900 --> 15:50.190
What nature, in her caprice,
left unfinished...

15:50.320 --> 15:52.780
science had the power
to make whole again.

15:52.910 --> 15:57.990
And now that I've acquired this,
my work here is nearly complete.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.870
You see, I've recently become
the beneficiary...

16:02.000 --> 16:06.790
of a rather generous grant from the Guild...

16:06.920 --> 16:08.000
of collegiate investors.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.250
Oh, I-I-- what?
Oh.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.340
Well, OK, well, I'd love to help you,
professor...

16:12.470 --> 16:14.260
but I don't know if I can handle
the extra work.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.300
Nonsense!

16:15.430 --> 16:18.510
The university bylaws clearly
stipulate that the roommate...

16:18.640 --> 16:22.100
of a suicide is automatically
granted a 4.0 for the semester.

16:22.230 --> 16:23.600
You've got a free ride...

16:23.730 --> 16:27.310
Mr. Whalen, that I might have
you all to myself.

16:27.440 --> 16:31.480
The invisible hand of fate
has brought us together, Quizboy.

16:31.610 --> 16:35.860
We freaks-- if you'll pardon
the crude vernacular...

16:35.990 --> 16:38.120
must work in tandem.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.490
I don't think he's your guy.

16:41.620 --> 16:43.660
Of course he is.
All the intel points to it, damn it.

16:43.790 --> 16:45.790
Again with the intel.
You saw what he said.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.960
He's not in the Guild of Calamitous Intent.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.880
It's like a businessman's club
or something.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.090
That's what they said about
the Bilderberg group, son...

16:52.210 --> 16:55.680
and then whammo!
Berlin Wall comes tumbling down.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.890
- No, it hasn't.
- Oh, it will, kiddo.

16:58.010 --> 16:59.680
It was decided at the last meeting.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.720
Billy, you got to do
the lab-assistant gig.

17:01.850 --> 17:03.850
- You're our only hope now.
- What do you mean, "now"?

17:03.980 --> 17:05.849
Well, look, I didn't
want to tell you this...

17:05.980 --> 17:08.060
but Stevie was our other
man on the inside.

17:08.190 --> 17:09.770
Code name-- Pussyface.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.230
Is that why he killed himself?

17:11.359 --> 17:12.530
Open your eyes, kid.

17:12.650 --> 17:13.650
Your real one.

17:13.780 --> 17:17.910
Fantomos killed him because
he was getting too close-- we think.

17:18.030 --> 17:20.579
And you expect me to take his place?

17:21.369 --> 17:22.740
No way, José!

17:22.869 --> 17:25.119
Relax, he's not gonna kill you.

17:25.250 --> 17:26.210
How can you be so sure?

17:26.329 --> 17:27.579
Because he's crazy about you.

17:27.710 --> 17:28.880
He loved your paper.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.380
I never wrote my paper.

17:30.500 --> 17:35.550
I spent the night explaining the dead Stevie
in the closet to the campus police.

17:35.670 --> 17:36.880
That's why we wrote it for you.

17:37.010 --> 17:39.590
Well, Stephen Hawking did.
We called in a favor.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.760
That's cheating.

17:40.890 --> 17:43.220
Cheating is what the spy
business is all about, boy chick.

17:43.350 --> 17:45.430
Why, if we don't keep our eyes
on our neighbof's paper...

17:45.560 --> 17:48.060
the baddies get the bomb,
and the whole world goes kablooey.

17:48.190 --> 17:51.060
You keep thinking you're here
on the G.I. bill or something, kid.

17:51.190 --> 17:52.770
You are not here to write essays!

17:52.900 --> 17:54.280
You're not even in college!

17:54.400 --> 17:59.320
You are in the office of secret intelligence,
you damn, dirty, little crybaby freak!

17:59.450 --> 18:01.370
- Hyah!
- Ow!

18:01.490 --> 18:02.490
Oh, watch the balls!

18:02.620 --> 18:04.160
Get him!

18:05.120 --> 18:07.080
Ah, there you are.
Come at once.

18:07.210 --> 18:09.040
The reactor's all fired up and ready.

18:09.170 --> 18:10.920
I need you to monitor the experiment.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.170
Wait, I don't think
I'm qualified to do that.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.670
I-I cheated.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.170
Don't you think
I know that, William?

18:18.300 --> 18:20.470
- You do?
- Of course.

18:20.590 --> 18:22.260
You did what any of us
who were born different...

18:22.390 --> 18:24.310
need to do to get
a leg up on everyone else...

18:24.430 --> 18:26.770
particularly when we're born
without proper ones.

18:26.890 --> 18:27.810
And what of it?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.520
Those quiz-show simpletons have
no right to keep a genius...

18:30.650 --> 18:32.360
from his dreams over petty money.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.190
Quiz show?
No, that's not what I was--

18:34.320 --> 18:36.230
Could you be a dear and get that for me?

18:36.360 --> 18:37.320
Oh, sure, Professor.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.360
What are you doing?

18:38.490 --> 18:40.820
Being born again,
my little friend.

18:40.950 --> 18:43.490
These mechanical husks
are more than mere prosthetics.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.790
They're muscle-growth accelerators...

18:45.910 --> 18:49.210
incubators for my
glorious new normal limbs.

18:49.330 --> 18:51.080
You're gonna grow new arms and legs?

18:51.210 --> 18:54.420
Precisely, my prodigiously
perspicacious protégé.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.130
Only the tremendous power
I require to do so...

18:57.260 --> 18:58.670
was always beyond my grasp.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.840
That is, until the Guild provided
the atomic get-up-and-go.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.680
Now, fire it up, my boy.

19:10.940 --> 19:13.350
It's-- it's working.
I feel it.

19:13.480 --> 19:17.530
Unspeakable power courses through
my every fibrous sinew.

19:17.650 --> 19:20.400
I feel as if I could take over the world!

19:20.530 --> 19:22.660
More power!

19:23.240 --> 19:24.620
Yes!

19:25.370 --> 19:29.910
They're becoming more than normal--
better, stronger...

19:30.040 --> 19:33.120
dare I say superhuman?

19:33.250 --> 19:35.290
More power, William!

19:39.340 --> 19:41.050
Something's amiss.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.880
Check the core wall
displacement sequencer.

19:43.010 --> 19:45.220
I-I-I don't know what that is.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.640
Of course you do.
You wrote a paper on it.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.310
No, Professor Fantomos, I didn't.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.140
I didn't write it.

19:52.270 --> 19:53.980
I cheated!

19:54.100 --> 19:57.110
Oh, bother.
Ohh!

19:57.230 --> 19:58.980
Aah!

19:59.530 --> 20:00.740
Aaahh!

20:01.530 --> 20:03.610
Aaaahhh!

20:07.370 --> 20:09.490
He died for my sin.

20:09.620 --> 20:11.910
Billy, don't worry, we're here!

20:12.040 --> 20:12.960
Bad news.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.540
The most asinine...

20:14.670 --> 20:18.960
slop-happiest piece of espionage
I've ever seen!

20:19.090 --> 20:21.130
Look at me when
I'm talking to you, Samson!

20:21.260 --> 20:23.420
Don't you want to wait
till Hunter gets here?

20:23.550 --> 20:25.890
You're gonna strain your voice
yelling twice.

20:26.010 --> 20:28.550
Colonel Gathers has been
transferred to Guam...

20:28.680 --> 20:30.810
effective 0700 this morning.

20:30.930 --> 20:34.140
Your windmill-chasing days
are over, Sancho Panza.

20:34.270 --> 20:37.360
You got a new assignment.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.570
Aw, come on.
This is rookie stuff.

20:39.690 --> 20:42.440
- Dismissed, Samson!
- What about the kid?

20:42.570 --> 20:43.990
What, do you want to adopt him?!

20:44.110 --> 20:46.950
I said take it on the arches.

20:47.070 --> 20:51.580
Psi-Ops needs guinea pigs
for their memory-wipe project, OK?

20:51.700 --> 20:55.120
So, unlike you, he still works here.

22:21.710 --> 22:22.880
Billy?

22:23.000 --> 22:26.210
Billy, you OK, fella?

22:26.340 --> 22:27.380
White.

22:27.510 --> 22:28.380
Brock.

22:28.510 --> 22:29.470
Dr. Venture, where--

22:29.590 --> 22:32.850
It's OK, Pally.
You just took a little fall is all.

22:32.970 --> 22:33.890
You're safe now.

22:34.010 --> 22:35.930
Oh, I was having
the weirdest--

22:36.060 --> 22:38.230
you sons of bitches!

22:38.350 --> 22:39.640
Come on!
Oh, hey, hey!
