WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:04.003
Hey, Kate,
get a load of this.

00:04.005 --> 00:08.207
A stamp, commemorating
some guy walking on the moon.

00:09.477 --> 00:12.277
ALF, it was one of mankind's
greatest moments.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.779
Big deal!

00:13.781 --> 00:17.416
I was the first Melmacian
to wash my hands before eating.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.085
Nobody put me on a stamp.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.187
Maybe you
should've used soap.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.490
Ha. Ha.

00:24.492 --> 00:25.958
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, honey.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.894
Oh, good, you're home.
What did you bring me?

00:28.896 --> 00:30.362
Nothing.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.298
That's the same thing
you brought me yesterday.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.634
I left your dinner
in the oven, hon.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.036
Unguarded?

00:37.038 --> 00:38.103
You wouldn't
have liked it.

00:38.105 --> 00:40.672
The veal was
nearly inedible.

00:40.674 --> 00:41.874
ALF!

00:41.876 --> 00:44.610
Next time,
try an overnight marinade.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.613
I'll make you a sandwich..

00:47.615 --> 00:49.848
...if there's any
bread left!

00:49.850 --> 00:52.284
I think there's
half a raisin bagel.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.922
Yo, Wilkins, how much do you
want to give to the monks?

00:56.924 --> 00:58.257
What monks?

00:58.259 --> 00:59.558
We got an appeal from

00:59.560 --> 01:02.461
the Brothers of
the Peaceful Dominion.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.530
That's my checkbook.

01:04.532 --> 01:07.733
Yeah, they're your checks.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.436
Don't worry.
I'm using your signature.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.072
I've even mastered
that effeminate loop

01:13.074 --> 01:15.307
you put on
your capital T.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.845
As long as these checks
are in my name

01:19.847 --> 01:22.781
I'll be the one who decides
who the money goes to.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.952
And my loops are
not effeminate..

01:26.954 --> 01:28.353
...they're decorative

01:29.957 --> 01:31.790
Well, we're in a mood.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.428
Hold still, Bri.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.230
I don't wanna stick you.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.632
You look great, B.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.568
Sort of like the Pope's son.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.136
I'm in a play at school.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.638
I'm Friar Tuck.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.373
One of Robin Hood's merry men.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.707
No kidding.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.043
We had a Robin Hood on Melmac.

02:58.045 --> 03:01.513
Did he take from the rich
and give to the poor?

03:01.515 --> 03:05.017
No, he just robbed
the hoods off people's cars.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.755
Honey, please. ALF,
would you leave us alone?

03:09.757 --> 03:12.357
Fine. I'll go bother Lynn.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.595
What's all this stuff?

03:16.597 --> 03:19.164
Oh, it's a project
for my sociology class.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.600
I'm putting together
our family tree.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.769
Well, who chopped it down?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.437
Was it me again?

03:25.439 --> 03:27.406
It is not that kind of a tree.

03:27.408 --> 03:30.375
See, look it shows
all of our ancestors

03:30.377 --> 03:32.678
who they married
and who their kids were.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.680
Each relative is a branch.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.715
Except your Grandma Dorothy.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.883
She's a nut.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.484
[laughing]

03:39.486 --> 03:41.119
Watch it.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.088
Hey, it is not like she's here.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.159
You can find out some really
interesting stuff this way.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.196
Like seeing a picture
of your mother wearing lipstick

03:51.198 --> 03:52.598
when she was 14.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.132
Which you yourself
was not allowed

03:54.134 --> 03:55.767
to wear until you were 16.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.637
I had chapped lips.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.540
You had chapped eyelids too?

04:03.477 --> 04:06.311
ALF, why don't you
make a family tree?

04:06.313 --> 04:09.414
Yeah, it's really a fun way
to remember your ancestors.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.583
Well, I don't remember much.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.553
My father was always
breaking things.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.622
And my mother sat
around eating all day.

04:18.359 --> 04:21.627
It's amazing you
turned out so well.

04:21.629 --> 04:25.697
Thanks, but sometimes I do
blow my nose on the wrong towel.

04:30.838 --> 04:31.970
What?

04:31.972 --> 04:34.806
[instrumental music]

04:37.778 --> 04:39.511
[sighs]

04:41.115 --> 04:42.581
Ah!

04:42.583 --> 04:44.850
I can see why your
spaceship crashed.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.586
You were over
the weight limit for luggage.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.088
Well, gee, Willie,
why didn't you ask for help?

04:50.090 --> 04:51.423
I did.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.924
You said no.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.061
If you'd only used
the magic word "Please."

04:57.164 --> 05:00.565
Oh, hey, this is all I
need for my family tree.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.334
You can put
the boxes back.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.169
Forget it.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.104
What's in these things anyway?

05:06.106 --> 05:07.873
These boxes all contain

05:07.875 --> 05:10.742
the remnants
of a vanished civilization.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.478
A people
whose culture and intellect

05:13.480 --> 05:17.149
were unsurpassed
in the known universe.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.885
Dashboard dice?

05:19.887 --> 05:20.786
Dashboard?

05:20.788 --> 05:23.455
What a great place for those!

05:23.457 --> 05:25.824
Hey, Kate, guess where
these are going?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.427
In the garbage.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.629
No. That's where I found them.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.734
Who are these...people?

05:37.438 --> 05:40.372
Oh, that's
my fourth grade class.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.941
I'm the one eating paste.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.744
Oh, what's this vacuum cleaner
doing in this picture?

05:45.746 --> 05:47.713
That's my teacher.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.650
Your fourth grade teacher
was a hoover upright.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.186
Bite your tongue.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.755
Mrs. Landers was remarkable.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.858
She could walk on her hands
and pick up lint

05:59.860 --> 06:02.127
with her big skinny mouth.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.397
[gasps]

06:05.399 --> 06:08.033
She was a vacuum cleaner.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.002
Oh, look, I see you got
a picture of your thumb here.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.306
Oh, I've made that
mistake myself.

06:14.308 --> 06:15.540
What mistake?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.242
I collect pictures
of my thumb.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.713
Look, here's a picture
of my thumb at the beach.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.550
Here's one
of my thumb at the prom.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.652
Oh, wait,
that's my toe.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.689
Well, this shot's ruined.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.292
Are these your parents?

06:34.294 --> 06:36.027
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.996
Uh, that's the day
they were married.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.999
See, mom's feeding dad
a piece of the wedding cat.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.238
You have your dad's nose.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.341
And your mother's, too.

06:49.343 --> 06:52.110
Well, noses run
in my family.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.578
Ha! Ha! Ha!

06:54.982 --> 06:57.115
Oh, I kill me.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.150
Yeah.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.720
Wait a minute.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.288
This can't be right.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.856
What's the matter?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.324
According to this..

07:06.326 --> 07:09.995
...my parents were married
on Twangle the 12th

07:09.997 --> 07:14.466
but...I wasn't born until
the 28th of Nathinganger.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.768
- Twangle?
- Nathinganger?

07:16.770 --> 07:19.438
What does that
mean, ALF?

07:19.440 --> 07:21.873
Well, isn't it obvious?

07:21.875 --> 07:24.876
It means my parents
were married..

07:24.878 --> 07:27.045
...before I was born.

07:28.382 --> 07:29.714
[sighs]

07:32.019 --> 07:35.787
And they say it's easy
raising an alien.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.123
Who says that?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.093
People who have never
raised an alien.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.964

doing in there?

08:14.394 --> 08:16.928

08:16.930 --> 08:20.499
Reflecting on the wretchedness
of life.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.168
I didn't mean
what are you<i> doing</i> in there.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.737
I meant, what are you
doing in<i> there?</i>

08:25.739 --> 08:30.709
Oh, sure.
Confuse me with syntax.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.210
We're coming in.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.517
What's going on?

08:38.519 --> 08:41.820
Looks like he's doing
his Susan Hayward impression.

08:44.191 --> 08:48.560
Oh, go ahead, make jokes
while my life is in shambles.

08:48.562 --> 08:51.363
ALF, what is
the problem?

08:51.365 --> 08:52.797
I already told you.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.834
I'm branded with
the worst stigma imaginable.

08:56.603 --> 08:58.737
I was born..

08:58.739 --> 09:00.705
...in wedlock.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.976
ALF, if it makes you
feel any better

09:04.978 --> 09:08.079
I was born in wedlock too.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.149
- So was I.
- So what?

09:11.151 --> 09:14.519
You think the whole universe
follows the same moral code?

09:14.521 --> 09:18.390
As one backward planet that
worships Don Knotts.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.127
We don't worships Don Knotts.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.796
Well, you should.
He's very entertaining.

09:26.934 --> 09:30.135
ALF...what difference
does it make

09:30.137 --> 09:33.672
if your parents were married
<i> before</i> you were born?

09:33.674 --> 09:35.807
You don't understand.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.677
On Melmac, being born
to a married couple

09:38.679 --> 09:41.546
was the most
disgraceful thing there was.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.848
Next to being a cat lover.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.154
It's obvious that ALF is very
upset. Let's leave him alone.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.189
Well, where are we
gonna sleep then?

09:51.191 --> 09:53.959
I can personally recommend
the laundry basket.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.695
We'll use the sofa bed.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.631
Not the sofa bed, Kate.
It's so lumpy.

and Mr. Sensitivity
is worried about lumps.

it'll only be for one night.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.775
Kate, you're an optimist.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.082

10:17.951 --> 10:20.452
I wish life were more fair.

undress with the shades down.

Well, I see ALF's
had his breakfast.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.385
At least he didn't
eat the tape recorder.

10:53.387 --> 10:54.853
What is this?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.755

of life's vicissitudes?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.925
'I've run away to a place'

12:40.927 --> 12:42.660
'where peace and tranquility'

12:42.662 --> 12:47.332
'allow for the contemplation
of life's vicissitudes.'

12:47.334 --> 12:49.934
[door opens]

12:49.936 --> 12:52.403
Willie, I couldn't
find him anywhere.

12:52.405 --> 12:56.107
Well, where could
a three foot, hairy alien go

12:56.109 --> 12:58.610
and not be conspicuous?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.445
Steven Spielberg's house?

13:02.716 --> 13:04.516
- Any sign of him, Bri?
- No.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.352
But my Friar Tuck
costume is gone.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.454
Maybe he went
to Sherwood Forest.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.990
No, Bri.
Sherwood Forest is in England.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.192
ALF only took enough
food to get to Canada.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.162
Why'd he run away?

13:17.164 --> 13:19.964
Oh, it's hard to explain, Bri.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.933
Y-you'll understand
when you're older.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.601
How old?

13:23.603 --> 13:24.969
Well, older than me.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.138
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.142
- 'Well?'
- Nothing.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.144
Where could he have gone?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.747
Someplace where
peace and tranquility

13:35.749 --> 13:40.018
allow for the contemplation
of life's vicissitudes.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.321
That sounds familiar.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.989
Well, that's what
he said on the tape.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.025
No, no, uh,
besides that.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.495
Wait a minute, ALF wanted me
to send my allowance

13:50.497 --> 13:52.497
to a bunch of monks.

13:54.134 --> 13:55.733
Listen to this.

13:55.735 --> 13:59.170
"Peace and tranquility,
life's vicissitudes."

13:59.172 --> 14:01.339
It's from the Brothers
of the Peaceful Dominion.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.142
That's it!
He's joined a monastery.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.312
I'm sorry.

14:09.783 --> 14:12.650
[Gregorian music]

14:14.421 --> 14:15.820
Uh, excuse me.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.255
Where's the little monk's room?

14:17.257 --> 14:19.591
I have to take a vicissitude.

14:23.797 --> 14:26.064
Well, I guess I can wait.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.768
Are you here
because of a painful secret

14:30.770 --> 14:33.504
from your past like I am?

14:33.506 --> 14:34.939
Or are you
just one of those guys

14:34.941 --> 14:36.708
who likes wearing a dress?

14:40.046 --> 14:41.212
Right.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.814
We're a silent order.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.349
We don't speak.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.818
Ixnay on the eaking-spay.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.355
Got it.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.695
[mumbling]

15:03.603 --> 15:04.836
Joke time, alright?

15:04.838 --> 15:07.438
This one will knock you
on your cassocks.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.109
What happened when the heater
went off in the convent?

15:11.111 --> 15:13.678
They had a bunch of blue nuns!

15:13.680 --> 15:16.514
Ha! Ha! Ha! Blue nuns.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.483
Get it? Ha!

15:22.756 --> 15:24.155
Tough room.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.758
[bell tolls]

15:28.061 --> 15:30.495
Hey, why don't you let
the hunchback answer it?

15:33.066 --> 15:34.432
[bell tolls]

15:40.440 --> 15:43.408
Oh, excuse me,
I-I'm sorry to disturb

15:43.410 --> 15:44.776
y-your peaceful dominion

15:44.778 --> 15:47.245
but, uh, I-I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.881
He's a rather short..

15:49.883 --> 15:52.583
...hairy fellow.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.285
Has anyone joined
your flock recently?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.854
I mean, like,
say since breakfast?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.392
Oh, t-thank you.
Thank you very much.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.094
Uh, should I
be wearing a hat?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.229
No, no, I'm fine.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.901
Here's a real gut buster.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.804
How does the friar
open the door to the abbey?

16:13.840 --> 16:15.707
With a monkey.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.642
Ha! Ha!

16:17.644 --> 16:19.777
Get it? Monk-key.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.513
What's the problem?

16:22.515 --> 16:24.916
This stuff going
over your haloes?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.754
ALF.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.390
Willie.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.926
H-how did you find me?

16:34.928 --> 16:37.595
One of the monks talked,
didn't he?

16:37.597 --> 16:39.030
Never mind that.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.399
ALF, how did you get here?

16:41.401 --> 16:43.167
Thumbnail Express.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.502
You hitchhiked?

16:44.504 --> 16:47.271
Yeah. Easiest ride I ever got.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.940
Who's going to drive by
and leave a monk

16:48.942 --> 16:51.175
sucking his exhaust pipe?

16:51.978 --> 16:54.112
ALF, your manners.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.780
Absolutely right.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.148
Where are they?

16:57.150 --> 17:00.418
Uh, Willie Tanner,
this is Ed the monk.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.620
Ed the monk,
Willie Tanner.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.323
Willie, Ed.
Ed, Willie.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.291
I don't know who
the other guy is.

17:07.293 --> 17:08.459
I think it's Cat Stevens.

17:12.298 --> 17:15.266
ALF, what if they figure out
you're an alien?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.335
Who are they going to tell?

17:19.839 --> 17:22.640
Isn't there someplace
we can go to talk?

17:22.642 --> 17:26.878
It's really rather difficult
to discuss certain details--

17:26.880 --> 17:29.247
This is my home now, Willie.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.250
These brothers are like..

17:32.252 --> 17:34.318
...sisters to me.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.854
Let it fly.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.923
Alright.

17:38.925 --> 17:42.960
Uh, I did a lot of thinking
on the drive up here

17:42.962 --> 17:48.066
and, uh...I've never told
another living soul

17:48.068 --> 17:49.767
what I'm about
to tell you..

17:51.271 --> 17:52.904
...and you..

17:54.774 --> 17:56.007
...and you.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.875
And, of course, you.

18:00.013 --> 18:02.914
Um, I know you're not exactly
crazy about my stories

18:02.916 --> 18:05.216
but I think you'll find
this one poignant

18:05.218 --> 18:08.386
and not without
a certain relevance.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.754
Brace yourself, boys.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.856
The sermon's coming
early this week.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.761
When I was growing up,
I thought my mother

18:16.763 --> 18:20.064
was the most beautiful
woman that ever lived.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.800
I-I-I guess every boy feels
that way about his mom

18:22.802 --> 18:24.335
but, you know,
I wasn't the only one

18:24.337 --> 18:25.636
who thought that
about my mother.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.339
Look here.
Look, look.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.007
[chuckles]

18:30.009 --> 18:31.209
Huh?

18:31.211 --> 18:33.945
Who's the goofy-looking kid?

18:33.947 --> 18:35.046
That's me.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.020
The years have been
kind to you, Willie.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.055
Very kind.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.691
May I continue with my story?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.826
Please. And put that away.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.598
Well, one night,
uh, I don't know

18:53.600 --> 18:56.100
I must've been
about six or so

18:56.102 --> 18:58.569
I-I was, I was walking
by my mother's room

18:58.571 --> 19:01.839
and I looked and I saw her
sitting at her dressing table.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.978
I saw her reach up
and take off her hair.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.815
I was just..

19:10.817 --> 19:12.150
I was destroyed.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.419
You know, I mean, not,
n-n-not because she wore a wig

19:15.421 --> 19:17.488
I-I didn't mind that.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.024
It was because
she didn't tell me

19:20.026 --> 19:23.528
and this brings me
to the<i> meaningful</i> part now.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.396
And not a moment too soon

19:25.398 --> 19:28.366
it's almost time for vespers.

19:28.368 --> 19:31.269
I hope that means cookies.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.803
ALF, I'm trying to explain

19:32.805 --> 19:34.639
why your parents
didn't tell you

19:34.641 --> 19:36.541
they were married
before you were born.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.443
Oh, continue, my child.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.346
I think that they didn't

19:42.348 --> 19:43.915
they didn't want
their son to think

19:43.917 --> 19:47.318
that they were any...thing
less than perfect.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.020
Tha-that's the way parents are.

19:49.022 --> 19:52.490
I-I know, I-I feel that way
about Brian and Lynn.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.760
An-and someday, when you have
kids of your own, you'll feel--

19:55.762 --> 19:57.195
Uh, uh, uh.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.930
I won't be having kids.

19:58.932 --> 20:01.299
Monks give up more than
talking, you know.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.767
Right, Eddie?

20:07.473 --> 20:11.075
Is it me or are those guys
a bunch of stiffs?

20:15.215 --> 20:17.448
Look, Willie, I'm a convertible.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.019
Face it, ALF.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.621
You're not monk material.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.057
Oh, yes, I am.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.360
They showed me
the list of qualifications.

20:29.362 --> 20:32.263
Sloth, greed, gluttony.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.999
Those are
the seven deadly sins.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.803
I thought the seven deadly sins
were those guys

20:38.805 --> 20:41.472
who lived in the forest
with Snow White.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.743
Those are the seven dwarfs.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.945
We prefer the term
"Little people."

20:51.017 --> 20:53.251
Come on home, ALF.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.219
We miss you.

20:55.221 --> 20:57.788
Nobody cares
about your past.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.690
Well, gee,
I don't know.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.526
Tonight's my turn
to bang the dinner gong.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.696
ALF.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.665
Okay, you got a deal.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.201
You came all this way to get me.

21:10.203 --> 21:13.004
If you want me back so badly..

21:13.006 --> 21:15.072
...you deserve me.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.208
Oh, thanks, ALF.

21:17.210 --> 21:18.376
Well, just give me a second

21:18.378 --> 21:21.345
to say goodbye
to the bros, okay?

21:21.347 --> 21:23.314
Yo, I'm leaving!

21:23.316 --> 21:25.483
[monks clapping]

21:28.421 --> 21:31.055
I thought this was
a silent order.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.696
[instrumental music]

21:40.266 --> 21:41.999
You know, mom, dad..

21:43.703 --> 21:46.203
...you'd like the Tanners.

21:46.205 --> 21:48.539
They care about me.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.442
Even when I do
something stupid like..

21:51.444 --> 21:53.878
...stomp grapes
in the bathtub.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.147
Goodnight, ALF.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.682
We're glad
to have you home.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.684
Can I have a cookie?

21:59.686 --> 22:02.887
They're not cookies,
they're vespers.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.556
And yes, you may.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.493
ALF, uh, do you know why

22:09.495 --> 22:11.095
there are purple footprints

22:11.097 --> 22:12.663
all over the bathroom?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.766
Uh, have a vesper, Kate.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.168
We don't want any.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.170
I'll have a couple of those.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.705
Willie.

22:20.707 --> 22:23.874
Willie, gluttony is one
of the seven deadly dwarfs.

22:26.713 --> 22:29.613
ALF, I'd like those footprints
cleaned up tomorrow.

22:29.615 --> 22:32.416
Thy will be done.

22:32.418 --> 22:33.751
Thank you.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.389
It's good
to have him back.

22:38.391 --> 22:41.459
- Amen to that.
- Come on, kids.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.094
Goodnight, ALF.
See you in the morning.

22:43.096 --> 22:45.096
- Goodnight, ALF.
- Goodnight.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.769
I want you both to know
that I'm, I'm not upset anymore

22:51.771 --> 22:54.805
that you kept
your marriage a secret.

22:54.807 --> 22:58.409
In fact, I have a secret
I haven't told you.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.782
Willie's mother wears a wig.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.119
Ha! Ha!

23:09.088 --> 23:10.554
