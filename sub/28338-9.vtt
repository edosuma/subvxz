to perform.

02:40.540 --> 02:42.000
What? No.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.620
I did not say anything
about having her perform.

is going to enjoy it.

02:56.170 --> 02:57.960
Really? Do you think that
right now?

02:57.960 --> 02:59.750
Because here's what's
tipping me off:

02:59.750 --> 03:02.580
your guitar is made
out of dead people, okay?

03:02.580 --> 03:04.710
So that doesn't feel
normal for me,

03:04.710 --> 03:06.670
and it's not on brand
with my show.

03:06.670 --> 03:07.880
It looks cool.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.620
Well, it looks like
a pile of bones.

just say?

the salt?

When you tell your daughter

04:41.120 --> 04:42.620
that she is beautiful...

04:44.250 --> 04:46.580
you're saying to her,

04:46.580 --> 04:50.250
"Who you are
Is how you look."

04:51.580 --> 04:53.170
You are saying to her,

on the inside,

at roller skates,

beautiful singing voice

of this home,

the person whose unparalleled
drawing and painting abilities

05:13.670 --> 05:17.080
is less important

05:17.080 --> 05:21.670
than the person
you appear to be.

you were in there.

I just want to say I'm sorry.

know about wrestling.

you were upset.

No, no, I mean, you did ruin
wrestling for me, that's true.

But I just walked around
and dealt with it.

some sandwiches.

ruined anything before.

do that?

Why do I always forget that?

I think you should just
back out of the show.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.420
No, no, it's okay.

07:38.420 --> 07:40.290
I want to go
through with it.

In for a penny,
in for a pound.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.960

How is that any different
than the rest of my life?

07:46.380 --> 07:48.790
At least I get the chance
to formally introduce myself

07:48.790 --> 07:49.790
to my people.

07:49.790 --> 07:51.790
You know what?
You're right.

07:51.790 --> 07:56.920
Okay, Eclipsa,
let's make them love you.

But first thing's first.
This outfit.

No, no, I'm definitely
changing out of it.

Then we'll make them love you.

So I asked him to buy me
a $60,000 necklace, obviously,

"You don't even have shoulders,

how are you going
to wear a necklace?"

Have you ever seen a necklace?

it's for a neck.

I have one, dummy."
