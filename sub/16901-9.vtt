WEBVTT

00:05.038 --> 00:05.902
Hey.

00:06.039 --> 00:07.631
I wanted to come say
"Merry Christmas"

00:07.774 --> 00:09.036
before we all leave
for the break.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.665
Well, thank you, Lemon.
That's very thoughtful.

00:10.810 --> 00:11.777
Help yourself
to a gift.

00:11.911 --> 00:13.811
Oh, wow.

00:13.947 --> 00:16.677
It's our new handheld
photo scanner/paper shredder.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.519
Oh, well, won't people just
end up shredding their photos?

00:20.653 --> 00:21.813
No, no.
It's very easy to use.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.048
If you want to photo-scan,
you flip the switch to "PS."

00:24.190 --> 00:26.124
And if you want to paper-shred,
you flip the switch to...

00:27.093 --> 00:29.061
Oh.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.220
I'd like to make
an announcement.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.430
I just want to say
that I'm really sorry

00:35.568 --> 00:37.536
for whatever I'm going to do
at the party tonight.

00:37.670 --> 00:40.138
And I forgive all of you
in advance

00:40.273 --> 00:42.798
for leaving me passed out
by the elevator in my own gravy.

00:42.942 --> 00:45.035
Merry Ludachristmas, everyone!

00:45.178 --> 00:47.339
Are you gonna do
Horny Santa again, Frank?

00:47.480 --> 00:49.209
That was so funny last year

00:49.349 --> 00:50.475
when I sat on your lap.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.045
Yes. Funny.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.821
So, uh, big plans
for the holidays?

00:55.955 --> 00:57.752
Yeah, my parents are coming
with my brother.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.052
And we're gonna go see
"Jersey Boys" on Broadway,

01:00.193 --> 01:01.660
and we're gonna go
to that restaurant

01:01.795 --> 01:02.989
where they pretend
it's Mars!

01:03.129 --> 01:05.063
God, you must be
a ball of anxiety right now.

01:05.197 --> 01:06.256
No.
I'm really excited.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.366
What are you trying to say,
Lemon...

01:07.500 --> 01:08.762
that your family's perfect
and you never fight?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.631
No, I remember them
arguing a lot

01:10.770 --> 01:12.931
during the gas crisis
of '79.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.099
But since Carter left office,
it's been pretty smooth sailing.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.140
You got that right.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.302
So, is your mom coming up
from Florida?

01:19.446 --> 01:22.472
No, I invited her out of
my paralyzing Irish guilt,

01:22.615 --> 01:25.641
but her plane was grounded
because of Hurricane Zapato.

01:25.785 --> 01:28.515
Ha! Look at that.
That's where she lives.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.953
Jupiter.
The eye of the storm.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.150
So are you alone
for Christmas?

01:33.293 --> 01:36.023
No, I was gonna drive up
to Vermont and surprise C. C.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.356
Sir!

01:37.497 --> 01:38.429
Your mother is here.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.089
She took a bus
to Atlanta.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.531
She got JetBlue
to accept an Amtrak ticket.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.034
Tell her I'm...
Jingle bells?

01:44.170 --> 01:45.933
Jingle bells,
jingle bells?

01:46.072 --> 01:47.903
Surprise!
It's your mother.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.269
Merry Christmas.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.278
Jack.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.112
Isn't this the office
you had before?

01:55.248 --> 01:56.806
I thought you were up
for a big promotion.

01:56.950 --> 01:57.814
I am, Mother.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.816
And there are only two nicer
offices in the whole building.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.818
Only two?
I don't like the odds.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.082
I think you better
let that dream go.

02:05.225 --> 02:06.453
Hello, Liz.

02:07.660 --> 02:08.820
What the hell was that?

02:08.961 --> 02:10.657
It's a message on my phone
from a friend.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.992
Oh, Jackie, please.
Who is she?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.124
Her name is C. C.
Is she Spanish?

02:15.268 --> 02:16.360
What if she was,
Mother?

02:16.503 --> 02:18.334
She's very smart, Colleen.
You'd like her.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.837
My thanks
to the peanut gallery.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.532
Jack...

02:22.675 --> 02:25.075
this coat
isn't gonna take itself off.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.532 --> 02:47.796
Ludachristmas is tonight?

02:47.934 --> 02:49.765
Well, I guess
I can make it.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.063
I just hope
I don't get drunk

02:51.204 --> 02:53.001
and sing Christmas carols
like I did last year.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.767
Well, I'm not going
because my parents

02:55.909 --> 02:56.967
and my brother, Mitch,
are in town.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.099
Mitch is here?

02:58.244 --> 02:59.404
Yes.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.571
For those of you
who don't know my brother,

03:01.714 --> 03:04.774
Mitch was in a skiing accident
his senior year of high school,

03:04.918 --> 03:08.410
and he has what's called
trauma-induced niveaphasia.

03:08.555 --> 03:12.685
Basically he's just stuck
in the day before his accident.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.618
Oh, tomorrow's the big day!

03:16.763 --> 03:18.697
It's gonna be totally rad!

03:18.831 --> 03:20.526
Yeah, Mitch! Rad!

03:23.403 --> 03:24.495
He thinks it's 1985.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.605
So if you meet him,
just be cool.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.229
It should be mentioned
that, sexually,

03:28.374 --> 03:30.001
Mitch is very much
an adult.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.270
No, it should not
be mentioned.

03:32.412 --> 03:36.109
Merry Christmas from
Sheinhardt-Universal, everyone!

03:36.249 --> 03:37.716
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

03:37.850 --> 03:38.874
Merry Christmas.

03:39.018 --> 03:40.815
Merry Jewish.

03:40.954 --> 03:41.818
Merry Christmas.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.149
What is this?

03:43.289 --> 03:45.814
It's a PS575 photo shredder.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.158
Well, that's not
the Christmas spirit.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.992
Christmas is about gratitude
and togetherness.

03:53.132 --> 03:56.431
Sitting with friends and family
around a crackling fire,

03:56.569 --> 03:58.503
waiting for the owl meat
to cook.

04:01.207 --> 04:02.435
Sometimes I don't think
you people

04:02.575 --> 04:04.167
understand Christmas at all.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.706
Hi.
I think I'm early.

04:07.847 --> 04:08.973
I'm here to have Christmas meats

04:09.115 --> 04:10.446
eaten off my chest
at some party?

04:15.688 --> 04:17.382
Merry Christmas,
Miss Lemon.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.115
Oh, thank you, Kenneth.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.494
Well, fancy suits.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.654
How was court?

04:24.797 --> 04:25.764
Not great, Beth.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.388
Oh, you really were
in court?

04:27.533 --> 04:30.559
All Tray had to do was sign
his community-service papers.

04:30.703 --> 04:33.228
<i>But he makes us stop
for breakfast first.</i>

04:33.373 --> 04:37.002
So it's my fault diners can
serve alcohol in New York State?

04:37.143 --> 04:38.508
That's on me now?

04:38.645 --> 04:40.909
Now I have to wear this
for 30 days.

04:41.047 --> 04:41.775
Oh, my goodness.

04:41.914 --> 04:43.882
If I even have a drop of alcohol
in my sweat,

04:44.017 --> 04:46.850
a signal goes to Ankle Bracelet
Headquarters in Denver,

04:46.986 --> 04:48.214
and I go to jail.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.890
And now?
This time of the year?

04:55.028 --> 04:57.223
Ludachristmas?
Nude Year's Eve?

04:57.363 --> 04:58.387
Martin Luther King Day?

04:58.531 --> 04:59.725
All you do is drink!

04:59.866 --> 05:02.300
No, Tracy, you are not going
to Ludachristmas.

05:02.435 --> 05:05.233
The three of you are in charge
of keeping him from drinking.

05:05.371 --> 05:08.738
Okay.
But who's project manager?

05:12.478 --> 05:13.445
That bad, huh?

05:13.579 --> 05:14.603
No, these aren't for me.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.977
I'm sending them
to my mother's hotel room

05:17.116 --> 05:18.913
because the room service there
is "too salty. "

05:19.052 --> 05:20.542
Family stuff can be tough.

05:20.687 --> 05:23.281
Lemon party!
Permission to land?

05:23.423 --> 05:26.221
Permission granted!

05:26.359 --> 05:27.917
There's my baby!

05:29.028 --> 05:32.088
Hey, Liz, you want to go skiing
up at Piper's Peak tomorrow?

05:32.231 --> 05:33.289
It's gonna be rad.

05:33.433 --> 05:36.596
Psych! You can't go!
It's the senior class trip!

05:36.736 --> 05:39.830
Aw! Psych!
You got me, Mitch!

05:39.972 --> 05:42.236
Jack,
these are my parents.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.809
Dick Lemon.
This is my boy, Mitch.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.640
Uh, my first wife,
Margaret.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.407
First and last.
Jack Donaghy.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.449
You are
a very, very handsome man.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.246
Looks like
an Arrow shirt model.

05:54.387 --> 05:58.255
So, Jack,
is this beautiful genius

05:58.391 --> 06:01.189
the best employee
you've ever had or what?

06:03.596 --> 06:04.858
No.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.966
I like
this guy's honesty.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.470
Yeah, me too.

06:13.606 --> 06:17.599
Show us what you've been
working on, Wilma Shakespeare.

06:17.744 --> 06:20.110
Oh, I'm... I'm just
so proud of you!

06:20.246 --> 06:22.578
Oh, you!
Butta-butta-butta!

06:22.715 --> 06:23.773
Mwah!

06:23.916 --> 06:25.713
Nice to meet you, sir.
Yeah.

06:33.459 --> 06:34.585
Uh, would you wrap these up

06:34.727 --> 06:36.718
and send them
to the Ritz-Carlton, please?

06:39.165 --> 06:42.999
Oh, my goodness.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.229
Look at this!

06:45.371 --> 06:50.331
They built all of this
because of words you wrote.

06:50.476 --> 06:52.944
Thank you, thank you.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.104
Hey, Liz, guess who's
going skiing with me.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.512
Chris Stanek...
your boyfriend!

06:57.650 --> 06:59.550
Whoo! Oh, what? Shut up!

06:59.685 --> 07:01.175
I don't like him!
Boys are gross!

07:01.320 --> 07:05.017
Did you hear that Chris Stanek
got divorced?

07:05.158 --> 07:06.318
When?
Is he dating again?

07:06.459 --> 07:07.756
Lemon, could I have a word
with you for a moment?

07:07.894 --> 07:09.088
Oh, excuse me.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.927
Is, uh, everything okay?
Yeah, why?

07:13.065 --> 07:15.090
Your family is...
strange.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.098
Oh, Mitch?

07:16.235 --> 07:18.931
No, he was in a skiing accident,
and he thinks it's 1985.

07:19.071 --> 07:21.062
No, I get it.
I'm talking about your parents.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.572
And what did
your mother mean

07:22.708 --> 07:24.642
when she said that you were
a beautiful genius?

07:24.777 --> 07:25.744
Was she taunting you?

07:25.878 --> 07:27.778
No!
They're just supersupportive.

07:27.914 --> 07:29.006
They've always been
like that.

07:29.148 --> 07:30.080
Even when I sued

07:30.216 --> 07:31.547
the Lower White Haven
School District

07:31.684 --> 07:32.946
to let girls play football.

07:33.085 --> 07:33.983
Hut!

07:36.923 --> 07:38.015
Yeah!

07:38.157 --> 07:39.454
Feminism!

07:40.760 --> 07:42.421
What?

07:42.562 --> 07:43.529
Oh.

07:45.364 --> 07:46.763
We didn't make the playoffs
that year,

07:46.899 --> 07:48.867
but I think we led the league
in bravery.

07:49.001 --> 07:50.127
My God.

07:50.269 --> 07:53.261
I've never seen such relentless
blind encouragement.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.374
No wonder you're a
sexually frightened know-it-all.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.703
Hey, Dad.
Take my picture. Look.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.039
I'm the lady
from "Flashdance"!

08:00.179 --> 08:02.306
That's a good
"Flashdance," honey.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.508
Good "Flashdance. "

08:07.353 --> 08:10.254
The holidays
without drinking is rough.

08:10.389 --> 08:12.448
Turns out
football is boring,

08:12.592 --> 08:13.957
my wife's sister
ain't as cute

08:14.093 --> 08:15.185
as I thought she was,

08:15.328 --> 08:17.319
and I cannot
play the guitar.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.829
Mr. Jordan,
I know how difficult this is.

08:19.966 --> 08:23.629
I was pretty addicted to coke
back in my Wall Street days.

08:28.407 --> 08:31.672
<i>But you can get through this.</i>

08:31.811 --> 08:33.506
The first night
is the hardest.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.273
But tonight
is Ludachristmas!

08:35.414 --> 08:36.278
No.

08:36.414 --> 08:40.078
Tonight you and I are gonna have
some real Christmas fun.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.687
We can play party games...
like "Murder"!

08:42.822 --> 08:45.188
First, everybody takes
a slip of paper out of a hat.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.189
And one person's slip
says "murderer,"

08:47.326 --> 08:49.419
and another person's
slip says "inspector. "

08:49.562 --> 08:51.325
Then everyone puts
their head down.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.591
Except the murderer...
He's the inspector.

08:53.733 --> 08:54.825
No, that's not right.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.197
K, thanks for trying
to help.

08:57.336 --> 08:59.896
But I'm gonna go home,
do some thinking,

09:00.039 --> 09:03.907
and tell my wife's sister
to disregard all my e-mails.

09:05.311 --> 09:08.007
That hotel was a disaster,
Jack.

09:08.147 --> 09:11.173
The TV had over 100 channels,
for God's sakes.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.841
I'm only gonna be here
for three days!

09:12.985 --> 09:14.714
Fine.
Mother, you can stay with me.

09:14.854 --> 09:17.516
No, I will not let you do that.
Are you sure?

09:17.657 --> 09:19.522
Yes, Mother.
I'm quite sure.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.388
All right, then.
That's settled.

09:21.527 --> 09:24.963
Jack, do you have a bathroom
that I can get to in a hurry?

09:25.097 --> 09:28.294
Yes.
Right... in here, Mother.

09:28.434 --> 09:30.197
<i>Well, that is close,
isn't it?</i>

09:30.336 --> 09:31.530
Yeah,
I'll be right out.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.476
She should have
been there.

09:38.611 --> 09:39.737
Knock-knock!

09:39.879 --> 09:41.540
It's just the Lemons.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.844
We've come to drop off
a little goodbye present.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.383
Oh, thank you!

09:46.519 --> 09:48.043
Oh, my goodness!

09:48.187 --> 09:51.020
What a beautiful office!

09:51.157 --> 09:54.524
Oh, your mother
must be so proud of you!

09:54.660 --> 09:55.991
Wow.
Look at this carpet.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.891
I feel like
we should take off our shoes.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.361
Should we take off
our shoes?

09:59.498 --> 10:01.022
No, please. Sit down
and make yourselves comfortable.

10:01.167 --> 10:05.103
We don't want to bother you.
We know you must have big plans.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.568
Well, I was going to drive up
to Vermont

10:06.706 --> 10:07.730
and visit my girlfriend,
C. C.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.067
Oh, I love that name!
C. C.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.336
Ooh, I'll be any girlfriend
of yours is a real winner!

10:12.478 --> 10:13.536
Well,
she is a congresswoman.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.374
Oh, my goodness!
Congresswoman!

10:15.514 --> 10:16.776
And she does have
her own Lifetime movie.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.941
Lifetime!
Wowzers!

10:19.085 --> 10:20.313
Why don't we cut
the charade

10:20.453 --> 10:22.785
and you two tell me what exactly
it is you want from me?

10:28.094 --> 10:29.288
Now, Alfonso,

10:29.428 --> 10:32.158
let's find where you should put
the keyboard.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.890
Open, open?

10:34.033 --> 10:35.364
Homina, homina, homina?

10:35.501 --> 10:38.664
Open Pit barbecue sauce?

10:38.804 --> 10:39.964
Yes.
This is the sweet spot.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.404
Oh, and no chitchat
between songs this year.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.736
People don't watch "Letterman"
for Paul Shaffer.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.111
Excuse me, ma'am.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.545
Do you know
where the bathroom is?

10:50.683 --> 10:53.777
Hi, there, Mitch.
It's Jenna.

10:53.919 --> 10:54.783
Maroney.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.615
<i>We know each other.</i>

10:56.756 --> 10:58.656
Are you, like, a friend
of my mom's or something?

10:58.791 --> 11:00.258
I mean, I'll tell her
you said hi.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.260
What's up?
Do you like Wham!?

11:09.402 --> 11:12.667
'Cause I'm kind of like
the George Michael of my school.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.397
Oh, you're Mitch.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.269
Yeah. Coming to the party tonight?

11:16.409 --> 11:18.172
Oh, I wish.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.938
I got to rest up
for my big ski trip tomorrow.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.104
You know,
maybe you and I

11:22.248 --> 11:23.738
could do something together
next week.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.750
Definitely.
My parents are away next week.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.616
You should come over.
I'll be in the hot tub.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.746
What?

11:31.891 --> 11:32.949
Oh, my God!

11:35.361 --> 11:38.057
That's a filthy
Christmas miracle.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.799
There you guys are.

11:42.935 --> 11:44.926
I'm sorry they just barged in
like that.

11:45.071 --> 11:45.935
Oh, not at all.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.540
They were just dropping off
this Christmas present.

11:48.674 --> 11:50.369
Oh, and look at this.

11:50.509 --> 11:53.103
It's got cheese
and butter and caramel.

11:53.245 --> 11:54.610
All my favorites.
How did you know?

11:54.747 --> 11:56.180
Well, we will let you go.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.215
We've got
a lot window-shopping to do.

11:58.350 --> 11:59.840
Jack, why don't you come
with us?

11:59.985 --> 12:02.215
Come on, you can talk to Mitch
about President Reagan.

12:02.354 --> 12:05.289
Oh, in his mind,
Reagan is still president.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.483
You lucky bastard.
What?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.225
Uh, I would love
to go with you.

12:11.363 --> 12:13.058
Good, good, good!

12:15.634 --> 12:16.498
Jack?

12:16.635 --> 12:18.398
Hey, dude,
I thought you left.

12:18.537 --> 12:20.004
Yeah, I mean,
what are you guys doing?

12:20.139 --> 12:21.071
Going to Ludachristmas?

12:21.207 --> 12:22.606
Yep.
We heard you can't drink.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.731
You still coming?

12:23.876 --> 12:26.242
No, no. I can't go
because of the ankle bracelet.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.539
Or maybe I could go
and just not drink.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.273
Hey, maybe I'll compromise.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.249
I'll go to the party, cut off
my foot, and drink all I want!

12:36.522 --> 12:40.891
Ludachristmas!
Ludachristmas! Ludachristmas!

12:41.026 --> 12:43.688
Ludachristmas!
Ludachristmas!

12:43.829 --> 12:45.194
Grizz, Dot Com.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.389
Shut the doors.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.864
Some people need to learn
about Christmas.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.035
Hey, watch out for her,
Jack.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.835
She's a natural athlete.

12:56.976 --> 12:58.910
Played high school football.

12:59.044 --> 13:00.773
It was just one game,
Dad.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.245
Although I did kind of change
everything forever.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.111
I'll never forget
that day.

13:05.251 --> 13:09.017
Jack, you laced those up
like a professional.

13:09.155 --> 13:10.122
Good for you!

13:10.256 --> 13:13.020
Nice to have some positive
reinforcement, isn't it?

13:13.159 --> 13:15.457
It's only positive reinforcement
when they say it to you.

13:15.594 --> 13:17.562
In my case,
they're just stating the facts.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.323
I do look like
the Arrow shirt man,

13:19.465 --> 13:21.262
I did lace up
my skates professionally,

13:21.400 --> 13:23.561
and I did do a fabulous job
finishing my muffin.

13:23.702 --> 13:25.727
You wish
you were in my family.

13:25.871 --> 13:28.066
Oh.
Don't be ridiculous.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.903
So this Disney cruise in March.
Are you in or out?

13:31.043 --> 13:31.941
Hey. Huddle up.

13:32.077 --> 13:33.374
We're gonna take a picture. Yeah.

13:33.512 --> 13:34.945
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.104
Say "Lemon. "

13:36.248 --> 13:37.613
Lemon!

13:37.750 --> 13:40.241
Jack!

13:40.386 --> 13:42.286
Having fun?

13:45.191 --> 13:46.283
Under the bridge,
under the bridge!

13:46.425 --> 13:47.824
Whoo, whoo!

13:47.960 --> 13:49.928
Jack, what the hell
are you up to?

13:50.062 --> 13:52.121
Mother, I'm sorry,
but the Lemons invited me out.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.789
And I couldn't say no.
They're very nice people.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.834
Oh, nice.
I'll show you nice.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.732
Let's all meet
down at the soda shop

13:58.871 --> 14:00.668
while this country
turns into Mexico.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.671
Now, you see, they don't
say things like that.

14:02.808 --> 14:04.241
They're very polite
to each other.

14:04.376 --> 14:08.142
I suppose you think that they're
more nurturing than I am.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.872
Mother,
there are terrorist cells

14:10.015 --> 14:11.744
that are more nurturing
than you are.

14:11.884 --> 14:14.011
Be careful.
I'll cry.

14:15.154 --> 14:18.021
You give me 10 minutes
with the Lemon family,

14:18.157 --> 14:20.125
and I'll have them
tearing at each other

14:20.259 --> 14:22.318
like drag queens
at a wig sale.

14:22.962 --> 14:25.863
Oh!
Mom, Dad, this is Jack's mom.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.125
We have heard
such great things about you.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.791
Have you?

14:29.935 --> 14:31.630
You must join us
for dinner.

14:31.770 --> 14:34.295
No, no. No. No, no.
We can't. We have plans.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.635
<i>Uh, had plans.</i>

14:36.775 --> 14:39.505
An evening out
with the Lemons.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.636
Who could ask
for anything more?

14:41.780 --> 14:43.372
Great!

14:46.352 --> 14:47.876
Thank you, Reverend Gary.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.352
That was both entertaining
and educational.

14:50.489 --> 14:53.356
Christmas has gone off the rails
around here.

14:53.492 --> 14:54.823
Look out there.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.791
That is not a Christmas tree.

14:56.929 --> 15:01.491
It's a way to lure tourists into
the basement to buy $20 salads.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.296
We've lost track
of what's important.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.597
So now we're gonna
go around the circle,

15:06.739 --> 15:10.038
and every one of us is gonna say
what Christmas means to them.

15:10.175 --> 15:12.200
Aaaaaaaaah!

15:16.448 --> 15:17.506
Let's start here.

15:21.687 --> 15:24.212
It's so hard to choose.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.052
The photos of the food
look so good.

15:27.192 --> 15:31.390
I am gonna have the fried
onion tower for two... for one!

15:31.530 --> 15:33.327
Good for you!

15:33.465 --> 15:35.729
You must be
so proud of Liz...

15:35.868 --> 15:38.359
making it on her own
so far away from home.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.703
That gives us an excuse
to visit New York.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.535
I see.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.938
Any grandchildren?

15:46.078 --> 15:47.875
Aw.
What a shame.

15:48.814 --> 15:50.076
Must eat you up inside.

15:50.215 --> 15:53.241
Oh, well,
Champy, our Spaniel,

15:53.385 --> 15:55.216
keeps us pretty busy.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.948
See, Mother?
Not all species eat their young.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.650
Let's change the subject.
Politics.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.727
We don't discuss that stuff.
Life is too short.

16:06.865 --> 16:10.528
Really?
Life is too short?

16:10.669 --> 16:12.899
Because your life
seems endless.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.974
Thank you, Reverend Gary.

16:19.111 --> 16:22.945
It was to the tune of "American
Pie" but so much longer.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.016
Listen,
we done learned our lesson

16:25.150 --> 16:26.947
about the big tree
or whatever.

16:27.086 --> 16:28.883
This has got to stop now.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.546
Yeah, who cares about
the true meaning of Christmas?

16:31.690 --> 16:34.124
It's about getting crap
and eating too much!

16:34.259 --> 16:34.782
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.191
It's about getting drunk
and hugging your cousin

16:37.329 --> 16:39.126
until your mom says,
"Frank, enough. "

16:39.264 --> 16:39.753
Right.

16:39.898 --> 16:42.264
Well, now seems like a good time
for Reverend Gary

16:42.401 --> 16:45.234
to show the video of his mission
to Guatemala last year.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.303
What?

16:46.438 --> 16:48.303
Is this a culture where
toplessness is common?

17:03.255 --> 17:07.214
<i>And here is what you did
with your Christmas presents.</i>

17:08.493 --> 17:09.290
Wow.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.123
We take so much
for granted.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.924
Instead of having a party,

17:13.065 --> 17:15.532
we should donate the money
to those kids.

17:15.666 --> 17:16.998
We should tell
all our family and friends

17:17.136 --> 17:18.364
we don't want any presents
this year.

17:18.503 --> 17:19.528
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

17:19.671 --> 17:20.968
We should volunteer
at a soup kitchen

17:21.106 --> 17:22.971
instead of shopping for stuff
no one needs!

17:23.108 --> 17:23.801
Yeah!

17:23.942 --> 17:26.843
We should go downstairs
and chop down the big tree!

17:26.979 --> 17:27.673
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

17:27.813 --> 17:29.246
Chop it down!

17:30.949 --> 17:32.814
No!
No, wait!

17:39.258 --> 17:40.885
No, no, no, no, no!

17:41.026 --> 17:42.550
Your mother is killing me.

17:42.694 --> 17:45.185
Have I ever "kissed a woman"?
What is that about?

17:45.330 --> 17:46.854
Welcome to my world,
Lemon.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.024
She's trying to break your spirit. Why?

17:49.168 --> 17:50.567
Because she's trying
to prove that your family

17:50.702 --> 17:51.862
is as screwed up
as mine is.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.369
That's ridiculous.

17:53.505 --> 17:54.995
Oh.
Mitch found a newspaper.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.665
Mitch,
that's a joke newspaper.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.675
What?

17:59.812 --> 18:01.006
Oh!

18:01.146 --> 18:03.171
Why can't you just leave
well enough alone?

18:03.315 --> 18:06.375
Because the Lemons are not
what they appear to be.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.679
I mean, I may be
heavy furniture,

18:08.821 --> 18:10.948
but I did a pretty good job
raising you.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.887
I mean, look at you today,
and look at them.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.083
They look happy.

18:14.226 --> 18:15.488
They're in denial.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.356
I mean, come on.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.389
Now, Dick,
let me get...

18:20.532 --> 18:22.625
Ah, ah, ah, Jack.
It's on me.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.532
Wouldn't be a Lemon party
without old Dick.

18:27.506 --> 18:29.201
Easy on the fried food,
honey.

18:29.341 --> 18:30.831
Oh, come on.
I can eat whatever I want.

18:30.976 --> 18:31.840
I'm a teenager!

18:31.977 --> 18:33.740
Mitch,
don't you ever get tired

18:33.879 --> 18:35.779
of Liz getting
all the attention,

18:35.914 --> 18:37.279
her being the baby
and all?

18:37.416 --> 18:39.350
Oh, no, my folks make
a lot of time for me.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.953
I mean, just yesterday we went
to see "Goonies" together.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.053
Uh-oh.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.419
You weren't supposed
to know that, Liz. Sorry.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.958
Wait,
you saw "Goonies" yesterday?

18:49.094 --> 18:50.857
Does he mean
1985 yesterday?

18:50.996 --> 18:53.863
Yeah, December 6, 1985.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.433
I mean, what else would I mean
by "yesterday"? Duh!

18:56.568 --> 18:58.627
Well, that was the day
of my football game.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.738
Did you not go
to my football game?

19:02.007 --> 19:06.068
We were
a little embarrassed, Liz.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.235
Dad, did you...

19:07.379 --> 19:09.813
It's White Haven football
for God's sake, Elizabeth!

19:09.948 --> 19:13.577
It means something!
I wore that uniform!

19:13.719 --> 19:15.653
I was taking a stand
for women!

19:15.787 --> 19:18.950
Are you taking a stand now
by not giving us grandkids?

19:19.091 --> 19:20.820
Oh, you want grandchildren,
Margaret?

19:20.959 --> 19:22.449
Why don't you ever bother Mitch
about that?

19:22.594 --> 19:24.425
Because he's 17!

19:24.563 --> 19:26.394
He's 40!

19:26.532 --> 19:27.692
What?

19:29.701 --> 19:31.760
Oh, my God.
The accident.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.235
I hit the tree!

19:33.372 --> 19:34.361
No, don't remember.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.064
Oh, I'm so old!

19:36.208 --> 19:38.676
Thank you,
Elizabeth Lemon!

19:38.810 --> 19:40.437
You are so self-centered,
young lady!

19:40.579 --> 19:42.410
You didn't even offer
to pay for this dinner.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.743
I'm on a fixed income!

19:44.883 --> 19:46.248
Could I have another drink?

19:46.385 --> 19:47.682
Bingo.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.414
This is not what I meant!

19:52.558 --> 19:53.718
Yes, it is!

19:53.859 --> 19:55.053
We're sending a message

19:55.194 --> 19:56.718
to all of those
who have forgotten

19:56.862 --> 19:58.352
the scruples
of Christmas!

19:58.497 --> 20:02.456
'Cause in order to stay sane,
you have to go crazy.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.874
I had a couple of drinks
before the meeting.

20:11.009 --> 20:12.203
Hold that, Kenneth.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.005
This is a flask.

20:14.146 --> 20:17.274
So y'all probably shouldn't
be listening to me.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.212
Ha ha ha ha!

20:25.657 --> 20:29.991
Have yourself
a merry little Christmas?

20:30.128 --> 20:35.225
Make the Yuletide gay?

20:35.367 --> 20:37.665
From now on?

20:37.803 --> 20:43.264
Our troubles
will be miles away?

20:46.345 --> 20:51.510
Here we are
as in olden days...?

20:51.650 --> 20:54.517
You know why I stay with
you, Dick?! Yes, I do know.

20:54.653 --> 20:57.850
Because I have nothing to give another
man! 'Cause you have no income of your own.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.924
I could have been
drinking these for years!

21:00.058 --> 21:01.923
Explain to me again
how gay marriage

21:02.060 --> 21:04.494
is gonna
tear this country apart!

21:07.432 --> 21:08.694
Merry Christmas, Mother.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.230
Merry Christmas, Jackie.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.429
Tomorrow night I'm gonna
take you to a cathouse.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.369
I hate cats.
You'll learn to love them.

21:15.507 --> 21:18.101
It was ridiculous
to lie to him that long anyway.

21:18.243 --> 21:20.108
My life is ruined!

21:27.052 --> 21:30.510
Imagine Christmas wishes?

21:30.656 --> 21:33.250
Shooting out of your eyes?

21:33.392 --> 21:36.589
A candy cake
full of snow dreams?

21:36.728 --> 21:42.257
A stocking full
of sm-i-i-iles?

21:42.401 --> 21:45.268
It's a Jordan Christmas?

21:45.404 --> 21:48.271
It's a Jordan Christmas?

21:49.305 --> 21:55.425
