that he just left, you know?

something bad happened.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.897
You know?

11:20.941 --> 11:22.551
I mean, don't
get me wrong.

11:22.594 --> 11:25.772
He has just left plenty
of times, right, you know?

11:25.815 --> 11:27.861

other so much.

like, three more days.

12:21.349 --> 12:24.613
Yeah, well, we got my dad
living with us right now.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.006
Ooh. I need Bud Carl

12:26.049 --> 12:28.922
to throw some of those
extra hours my way.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.575
CLARK: Did you talk
to him about that?

12:30.619 --> 12:34.014
DANTE: Yeah, man, but I'm not
the first on that list.

12:34.057 --> 12:37.104
What, he hasn't given you any
OT, even after you asked him?

12:37.147 --> 12:39.193
He says it's coming.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.238
Well, you can ask him
again right now.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.208
Peekaboo!

12:54.251 --> 12:55.296
Hey, man, thanks
for watching her.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.514
You're a big help.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.081
Is she leaving?Yeah, we got to go.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.213
Come on.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.302
Yeah, I got you. Come on.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.614
Thanks, guys.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.024
I'm sorry.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.986
I'm sorry.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.075
But we can investigate.No.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.598
Here.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.600
That is exactly my point.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.907
You need to keep his
mind off his dad.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.430
But we can find him.

13:42.473 --> 13:45.912
Coop, you got to listen
to me for a minute, okay?

13:45.955 --> 13:47.261
He still doesn't know.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.045
So if he brings up his dad,

13:49.089 --> 13:51.439
you say he's gone to look
for work in Texas.

13:51.482 --> 13:52.614
Got me?

13:52.657 --> 13:53.615
Got it.

13:53.658 --> 13:54.616
Promise?

13:54.659 --> 13:56.096
Promise. Yeah.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.967
All right. Go ahead.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.102
Hey. Uh, it's Garrett.

14:02.145 --> 14:06.193
Um, so, I'm, like, officially
worried about you now.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.934
Uh...

14:07.977 --> 14:10.023
I-I'm gonna have, like,
a lot more hours,

14:10.066 --> 14:13.374
so I-I could really use
your help.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.680
Uh, call me.

14:23.036 --> 14:25.429
Why do you
even care?

14:27.431 --> 14:30.478
You don't even think I should
listen to what he has to say?

14:30.521 --> 14:33.002
I need to tell him
that I'm quitting.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.569
You need to call
Child Services.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.440
Didn't you hear
those women?

14:36.484 --> 14:38.355
Men like that
do not change.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.662
For Carrie, I mean.Oh, my God.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.664
Don't. I mean,
I got it at first.

14:42.707 --> 14:45.188
Like, a cute working-class guy
before you go off

14:45.232 --> 14:46.973
to college and find
a real boyfriend, but...

14:47.016 --> 14:50.150
Julie, can you stop
with this catty rich girl shit?

14:50.193 --> 14:53.066
You're a rich girl.
You're at a fucking

14:53.109 --> 14:55.764
country club. You...
you need to stop acting

14:55.807 --> 14:58.288
like babysitting for a mill
worker makes you anything other

14:58.332 --> 15:01.335
than, like,
a blue-collar tourist.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.254
He gave you the money?

15:07.297 --> 15:09.473
He gave me the money.

15:09.517 --> 15:11.606
When?

15:11.649 --> 15:13.608
I don't know, man.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.479
Come on, Ken.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.004
Am I being a son
of a bitch to you?

15:18.047 --> 15:19.701
Huh? I'm not.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.443
So don't be a son
of a bitch to me.

15:26.229 --> 15:29.754
When did Rick
give you the money?

15:32.235 --> 15:33.584
The next morning.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.586
The next morning.
Okay.

15:36.631 --> 15:38.589
Why you?

15:38.633 --> 15:41.288
Who else is
he gonna give it to?

15:41.331 --> 15:43.507
We were best friends for years.
We had a business, Pete.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.598
Why didn't he just give Terri
the money himself?

15:47.642 --> 15:50.384
Like I said,
we were old friends.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.603
The way you keep old friends

15:52.647 --> 15:54.823
is not asking why they
don't talk to their ex-wives.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.216
Uh-huh.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.610
12345.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.049
Uh, hey. Sorry, Chief.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.442
Uh, can I talk to you
for a second?

16:14.451 --> 16:17.106
Hey, come here for a sec.

16:17.150 --> 16:20.109
So, the VIN don't match
the license plate,

16:20.153 --> 16:22.590
which means the car we impounded
belongs to his brother,

16:22.633 --> 16:24.070
Dan Fry.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.072
So it's not his truck?

16:26.115 --> 16:28.465
Yeah.Dan's is the truck
that we searched

16:28.509 --> 16:30.119
the night of the murders.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.382
Does the brother have
Walmart's truck?

16:32.426 --> 16:33.731
Well, we're finding
that out now.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.777
Good work.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.257
Thanks, Chief.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.565
I named him Hambone the Hamster,

16:41.609 --> 16:44.742
but my dad changed it
to MC Hamster.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.135
Can he sleep
here with us?

16:46.179 --> 16:48.659
Sure, as long
as he stays in his cage.

16:48.703 --> 16:49.834
In you go, buddy.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.445
CESAR:
Hey,

16:51.488 --> 16:53.447
have you guys ever stayed up
all night before?

16:53.490 --> 16:55.536
No.Yeah.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.103
All the time.I do, too.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.669
You guys want to?

16:58.713 --> 17:00.671
COOPER: What would
your parents say?

17:00.715 --> 17:02.282
CESAR:
My parents don't know.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.632
Then why do you do it?

17:04.675 --> 17:05.850
'Cause it's fun.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.809
You have to do it
to know.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.246
COOPER:
Have you ever gotten caught?Well,

17:10.290 --> 17:12.248
my dad caught me once.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.381
What did you say?

17:16.600 --> 17:19.516
I told him he can suck a fart
out of my butt.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.128
COOPER:
Ew! Gross!

17:22.171 --> 17:23.477
CLARK:
Hey, Coop?

17:23.520 --> 17:25.131
Yeah?

17:25.174 --> 17:26.480
Yeah?

17:26.523 --> 17:28.221
You guys need
to get to sleep, okay?

17:28.264 --> 17:29.657
This is your ten-minute warning
for lights-out.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.528
COOPER:
Okay.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.139
Everybody good
in here?

17:33.182 --> 17:34.314
Ricky?

17:34.357 --> 17:35.750
You good?

17:35.793 --> 17:36.751
You all right,
buddy?

17:36.794 --> 17:37.839
Yeah.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.580
Cesar?

17:39.623 --> 17:41.321
Oh. Yes, sir.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.497
All right. Let's all go brush
our teeth, okay, everybody?

17:43.540 --> 17:45.281
Everybody go.
Brush 'em up.

17:45.325 --> 17:46.500
Pearly whites.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.197
Let's go.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.594
So, what do you guys
want to do tomorrow?

17:53.637 --> 17:55.422
Make spears.Ricky's the guest.

17:55.465 --> 17:56.858
He chooses.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.773
I'm the guest
here, too.You choose.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.862
I don't know
how long I can stay, anyway.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.386
You're staying
all day, Ricky.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.519
To make sure you don't think
about your dad.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.390
RICKY:
'Cause why?

18:08.739 --> 18:12.352
Because your dad
is looking for work in Texas.

18:12.395 --> 18:15.746
I don't think
my dad's in Texas.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.838
We can investigate.

18:20.882 --> 18:25.234
Yeah. We can be detectives
and look for him.

18:25.278 --> 18:28.716
I don't think
we're gonna find him.

18:29.978 --> 18:31.893
CESAR :
Oh, man.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.721
But...

18:33.764 --> 18:34.722
okay.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.332
Yes!

18:36.376 --> 18:37.594
Good night.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.335

It's all right. What's up?

19:19.636 --> 19:21.116
It's my day off,
but the chief said

19:21.160 --> 19:22.248
I should fill you in
on the case.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.727
Sure. Come on in.

19:23.771 --> 19:26.643
Walmart and his brother
traded trucks.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.645
That means we never
actually checked Walmart's

19:28.689 --> 19:30.517
for blood traces.Who's on that?

19:30.560 --> 19:32.562
Chewy. Oh, and we got some new
info from the Youngstown Police.

19:32.606 --> 19:36.131
Apparently, Rick Mitchell
was arrested last March.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.524
What for?Trespassing.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.308
But he wasn't charged.
They held him overnight,

19:39.352 --> 19:41.397
and then let him go.Where'd he, uh...

19:41.441 --> 19:42.964
where'd he trespass?

19:43.007 --> 19:44.618
A scrap steelyard.

19:44.661 --> 19:47.229
The Ohio cops suspected he was
planning to steal and resell,

19:47.273 --> 19:49.579
but the security guard
caught them too early to know.

19:49.623 --> 19:52.234
"Them"?He was busted
with a guy named

19:52.278 --> 19:54.454
Grady Kovak, who used
to live in Braden

19:54.497 --> 19:56.195
and worked at Carl Steel.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.370
Well, has anybody been
to Youngstown

19:57.413 --> 19:58.588
to check all this out?

19:58.632 --> 20:00.460
The Ohio cops wanted
to follow up,

20:00.503 --> 20:02.462
and the chief said they're
touchy about jurisdiction.

20:02.505 --> 20:03.941
But it's not their case.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.421
They'll get to it
in a week at best.

20:05.465 --> 20:06.944
Probably longer.So,

20:06.988 --> 20:09.208
are you gonna go to Youngstown?

20:09.251 --> 20:11.166
Am I? Hell no.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.560
Is that why
you came here,

20:13.603 --> 20:16.127
to get me to go
to Youngstown?

20:16.171 --> 20:17.259
Look, I got to watch

20:17.303 --> 20:19.435
what I do right now. I'm, uh...

20:19.479 --> 20:23.265
being a little more careful
than usual.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.311
Okay.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.703
Looks like I'll have to go
on my own.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.099
You get caught in another
state working a case off-book,

20:31.142 --> 20:33.319
Pete'll murder you.My risk, my choice.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.408
Look, you're just
out of the academy.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.410
You're black. You get caught,
they're not gonna let it slide.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.455
When you were my age and
they told you no, what'd you do?

20:39.499 --> 20:41.457
What you
think I did?All right, then.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.503
Does this look like a life
you want to emulate?

20:43.546 --> 20:45.287
Huh?

20:45.331 --> 20:46.506
All right,
say you do find something.

20:46.549 --> 20:47.724
What then?

20:47.768 --> 20:49.291
Depends on what I find.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.075
See you.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.469
See you.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.514
Hey.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.604

21:41.343 --> 21:43.302
Your truck.
All my stuff.

21:43.345 --> 21:46.435
And they said they're gonna give
me eight to ten years for it.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.309
Wait, they already
talked to you?

21:50.352 --> 21:53.529
Fuck yes, man. What do you think
I'm talking about here?

21:53.573 --> 21:55.618
What did you tell them?

21:55.662 --> 21:59.100
Well, they wanted
to know about Rick.

21:59.143 --> 22:02.538
And what did you tell
them about Rick?

22:02.582 --> 22:04.714
Well, I don't know
anything about Rick,

22:04.758 --> 22:07.151
other than Rick
is an asshole.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.458
Shut the fuck up
about Rick, Dan.Oh, my God.

22:09.502 --> 22:10.459
Here we go.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.461
Oh. Oh, Rick.

22:12.505 --> 22:15.682
Oh, Rick, you hung
the fucking moon, didn't you?

22:15.725 --> 22:18.075
You know, he runs
your ass out of business.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.425
He did not run me
out of business.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.122
And it's not till after Rick
is sick and tired

22:21.165 --> 22:22.776
of your stupid face
that you lower yourself

22:22.819 --> 22:25.387
to go into business
with your own fucking brother.

22:25.431 --> 22:26.475
That's great.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.390
That's really cool.

from this asshole, please?

22:32.438 --> 22:34.483
Can I sit somewhere else?

22:34.527 --> 22:36.659
Great. Thank you.

22:36.703 --> 22:39.227
I pay taxes.

22:40.271 --> 22:42.143
Assholes.

22:42.186 --> 22:46.147
You know, Dan...

22:46.190 --> 22:48.802
ten years I've been
waiting on your dumb ass

22:48.845 --> 22:50.804
to tell me how jealous
you are of him.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.458
:
Jealous.

22:52.501 --> 22:55.112
I am not jealous
of that skimming piece of shit.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.151
What are you doing?
You coming in,

35:10.195 --> 35:11.326
am I taking you
home, or what?

35:11.370 --> 35:14.199
No, no.

35:14.242 --> 35:18.290
Hey, uh, listen, I've, um...

35:18.333 --> 35:21.815
I've been talking
to some guys about a job.

35:21.858 --> 35:24.252
What kind of job?

35:24.296 --> 35:25.775
A paper route.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.777
What the fuck do you think?
A heist-type thing.

35:27.821 --> 35:31.085
Oh, a heist. Great.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.608
Just like that time
you got high on ketamine

35:32.652 --> 35:34.349
and tried to talk me
into robbing that hotel

35:34.393 --> 35:35.394
with them paintball guns?

35:35.437 --> 35:36.743
You know what,
that is so unfair,

35:36.786 --> 35:38.397
because I was on drugs
at the time.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.528
You're on drugs right now.

35:39.572 --> 35:41.400
Not on those drugs.

35:41.443 --> 35:43.097
Dick.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.230
That's your answer?

35:45.273 --> 35:46.622
You're gonna...
you're gonna be a...

35:46.666 --> 35:48.189

no

35:48.233 --> 35:51.149
I am a no-shit criminal.
So are you.

35:51.192 --> 35:53.412
No, Dan. Let me explain
something to you.

35:53.455 --> 35:56.241
The reason my thing
worked so long

35:56.284 --> 35:59.679
is because we took so little,
nobody even noticed.

35:59.722 --> 36:02.421
And even if they did notice,
they didn't care. Okay?

36:02.464 --> 36:05.119
God, just...

36:05.163 --> 36:07.339
I need you to do
this job with me.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.297
I ain't doing shit with you!

36:09.341 --> 36:11.212
Please don't treat me
like a goddamn kid,

36:11.256 --> 36:13.127
because I am not a kid.
I am an adult.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.302
Those are kids.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.652
That's Rick's kid.What the fuck?

36:16.696 --> 36:18.611
Goddamn it.

Yeah.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.624
COOPER:
We are detectives,
and we are investigating

36:31.667 --> 36:34.714

think his dad is in Texas.

Yeah.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.876
Okay.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.835
You guys got any
hot leads?

37:08.878 --> 37:10.619

You try fingerprints?

37:12.534 --> 37:14.449
Put out an APB?

37:14.493 --> 37:16.756
You could collect
some fingernails.

37:16.799 --> 37:18.323
You know, you could
look around his bathroom

37:18.366 --> 37:19.628
for some DNA samples.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.804
Run his plates.
You can also ask around

37:21.848 --> 37:23.589
places he hangs out.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.373
Oh, we're already planning

48:14.195 --> 48:15.631
But I do deserve your respect.

48:15.675 --> 48:17.546
Well, you earn respect

48:17.590 --> 48:19.200
when you play by the rules.

48:19.244 --> 48:21.899
What you want is to be exempt
from the rules.

48:21.942 --> 48:23.901
For us to just, you know,

48:23.944 --> 48:25.903
look the other way.

48:29.428 --> 48:31.386
As your friend,

48:31.430 --> 48:35.303
as someone who actually
gives a shit about you,

48:35.347 --> 48:40.134
I'm asking you, please, just be
done with this case, man.

48:40.178 --> 48:42.397
For your own good.

48:42.441 --> 48:44.138
For Tony's.

48:44.182 --> 48:47.228
I mean, you saw how those guys
smacked you around last time.

48:49.056 --> 48:52.016
What are they gonna do
next time?

49:01.982 --> 49:04.637
I'm sorry we didn't
find your dad, Ricky.

49:04.680 --> 49:07.292
You mean really
or pretend?

49:07.335 --> 49:10.425
No, I mean, I'm actually sorry
we didn't find him.

49:10.469 --> 49:12.688
I was kind of
hoping we would.

49:12.732 --> 49:15.691
I thought we were all
pretending he was still alive.

49:15.735 --> 49:17.606
What do you mean?

49:17.650 --> 49:19.957
I saw on the TV that
they found his blood.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.437
After my mom
fell asleep.

49:22.481 --> 49:25.440
What did they say?

49:25.484 --> 49:28.530
Just that everyone
thinks he's dead.

49:28.574 --> 49:30.532
But people still pretend
that he's alive to me.

49:30.576 --> 49:32.970
My mom even pretends
that he's alive to me.

49:33.013 --> 49:36.321
That's what I thought we
were doing here, too.

49:38.018 --> 49:39.541
Aren't you sad?

49:39.585 --> 49:41.108
Yeah.

50:01.781 --> 50:03.739
Did you guys have fun?

50:03.783 --> 50:05.611
Yeah.

50:05.654 --> 50:08.005
What all did you guys do?

50:08.048 --> 50:10.137
You know, played games,
explored.

50:10.181 --> 50:13.706
Made some inventions.
You know, that kind of stuff.

50:13.749 --> 50:15.229
Yeah

50:15.273 --> 50:17.362
Yeah. I like Ricky.
He's nice.

50:17.405 --> 50:19.494
Did he seem worried at all?

50:19.538 --> 50:21.453
No.

50:21.496 --> 50:25.022
Uh, we tried to find his dad.

50:25.065 --> 50:26.371
You did what?

50:26.414 --> 50:29.026
Maybe his dad is
back from Texas.

50:29.069 --> 50:32.507
Or-or something bad happened.
Maybe he didn't go to Texas.

50:32.551 --> 50:34.466
Cooper, when we ask you
not to do something,

50:34.509 --> 50:36.511
we expect you...I know, I know.

50:36.555 --> 50:40.211
It was just a game, and we
didn't find his dad anyway.

50:40.254 --> 50:43.040
But you know
what we did find?

50:45.390 --> 50:47.609
See, look.

50:47.653 --> 50:49.176
There's blood on it.
This is a clue

50:49.220 --> 50:50.351
for the Seven Bloods murder.

50:50.395 --> 50:51.700
Uh, where did you
find this?

50:51.744 --> 50:54.268
On the road near
where it all happened.

50:54.312 --> 50:57.315
Oh, I know. Could you guys
take me to the police station?

50:57.358 --> 50:59.404
Maybe they'll listen to me
if I have a grown-up with me.

50:59.447 --> 51:01.101
You know, I think
the police probably have

51:01.145 --> 51:03.103
enough on their hands
as it is.

51:03.147 --> 51:04.626
And if this were
really a clue,

51:04.670 --> 51:06.280
I bet they would've
found it already.

51:06.324 --> 51:08.543
But it is a real clue.

51:08.587 --> 51:12.547
Okay, um, it's really cute.

51:12.591 --> 51:14.158
It has mice on it.Yeah.

51:14.201 --> 51:16.247
We could use it
in MC Hamster's cage

51:16.290 --> 51:18.640
as a hamster duvet.

51:18.684 --> 51:21.339
All right.

51:21.382 --> 51:23.080
Okay.All right.

51:23.123 --> 51:24.081
Thank you, Coop.

51:25.560 --> 51:28.781
So why don't you tell me
about this Cesar kid?

51:28.824 --> 51:30.304
What's his whole deal?

51:30.348 --> 51:32.437
I think he's trying
to impress me.
