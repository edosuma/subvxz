16:49.341 --> 16:51.385
Yeah, we talked to him.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.847
I'm not saying I trusted him.
The opposite.

16:54.930 --> 16:59.518
It was like he knew
I knew he was pretending.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.562
It was a game.
- To me, he just felt honest.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.314
Most Pre-Pans don't.

he can be compelling.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.612
But he's not innocent
or kind.

17:10.696 --> 17:15.117

we gave them some food

17:15.200 --> 17:16.618

"Hamlet" is easily

18:21.350 --> 18:23.852

"August Osage County."

Dieter.

close-minded to you people?
