01:07.165 --> 01:10.885
<i>As far back as I can remember,</i>
<i>I had a happy childhood.</i>

01:12.485 --> 01:13.605
<i>But I grew older,</i>

01:14.445 --> 01:16.925
<i>and that's when the questions started.</i>

01:18.125 --> 01:20.605
<i>And with the questions came the suffering.</i>

01:22.005 --> 01:23.005
<i>Who am I?</i>

01:24.445 --> 01:25.685
<i>Where do I come from?</i>

01:26.645 --> 01:28.125
<i>What is my story?</i>

01:31.205 --> 01:32.885
<i>Who were those women</i>

01:32.965 --> 01:35.925
<i>whose names were always</i>
<i>pronounced quietly...</i>

01:36.605 --> 01:38.805
<i>when they thought I wasn't listening?</i>

01:40.685 --> 01:41.725
<i>Who were they?</i>

01:43.845 --> 01:44.925
<i>Who were they?</i>

01:54.165 --> 02:00.125
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

02:07.405 --> 02:11.525
CHUBUT PROVINCE, ARGENTINA. 1925

05:02.725 --> 05:04.165
Can I touch your face?

06:03.005 --> 06:05.365
I imagine there are things
you'd like to know.

06:06.965 --> 06:07.885
Things?

06:12.805 --> 06:13.645
Everything.

06:23.005 --> 06:24.605
It's impossible to know everything.

07:31.245 --> 07:32.805
Are you in the first year?

07:37.045 --> 07:39.805
But I've been sick
and I missed the first few days.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.885
If you don't dry off,
you'll get sick again. Come on.

07:46.805 --> 07:47.685
Come on!

07:50.885 --> 07:53.125
VANITY IS YOUR WEAKNESS

08:11.885 --> 08:15.325
Do you think they will take into account
the days off that I've missed?

08:18.245 --> 08:20.125
Don't worry, I'll talk to them.

08:20.765 --> 08:23.725
I'm in my third year and I work here.
My aunt is the headmistress.

08:26.605 --> 08:27.805
Let me help you.

08:32.325 --> 08:33.245
Thank you.

08:41.845 --> 08:43.525
-Am I hurting you?
-No.

08:49.925 --> 08:50.965
And now?

08:52.645 --> 08:53.645
No.

08:56.005 --> 08:56.885
Now?

08:56.965 --> 08:57.805
No.

09:01.885 --> 09:02.925
My name is Elisa.

09:04.285 --> 09:05.205
I'm Marcela.

09:13.605 --> 09:14.525
I like your mole.

09:23.645 --> 09:26.925
This week, we are going to learn
about pronouns.

09:29.405 --> 09:30.565
Come in.

09:32.325 --> 09:34.085
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

09:34.405 --> 09:37.285
Excuse me, Sister,
she's new at the school and was lost.

09:37.365 --> 09:39.445
She's been sick
and missed the first few days.

09:39.525 --> 09:43.125
But she's very hardworking
and keen to get up to date quickly.

09:43.205 --> 09:45.805
-Can she take a seat?
-Yes. Thank you, Elisa.

09:46.165 --> 09:47.125
Please...

09:48.725 --> 09:49.765
Your name?

09:50.245 --> 09:51.885
Marcela Gracia Ibeas.

09:51.965 --> 09:54.165
Very well. Have a seat there, please.

10:00.045 --> 10:01.965
Let's continue with the lesson.

10:02.245 --> 10:06.325
People or things
are not only called by their name,

10:06.405 --> 10:09.885
but also by words which replace the name.

10:10.285 --> 10:12.005
So, when we say,

10:12.245 --> 10:15.765
"Bernardo was very happy with his Elvira,

10:16.085 --> 10:18.125
and they lived happily together,

10:18.205 --> 10:20.645
she with him, and he with her,"

10:20.725 --> 10:23.925
"he" replaces Bernardo
and "she" replaces Elvira.

10:53.085 --> 10:54.085
You scared me.

10:54.165 --> 10:55.645
Really? I'm sorry.

10:56.885 --> 10:58.205
I was waiting for you.

10:58.725 --> 11:02.325
I live upstairs with my aunt
and the other nuns. Didn't I tell you?

11:03.165 --> 11:04.765
-Inside the school?
-Mm-hmm.

11:06.325 --> 11:07.645
I wanted to thank you.

11:08.565 --> 11:09.925
There's no need.

11:16.805 --> 11:19.005
What is it like living with the nuns?

11:20.045 --> 11:21.125
What do you think?

11:23.005 --> 11:23.925
I don't know.

11:29.085 --> 11:30.165
It's hell.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.725
Considering they're the wives of God,
they're a bunch of old hags.

11:35.805 --> 11:38.765
They're always fighting
and criticizing each other,

11:39.325 --> 11:40.645
and they're not happy.

11:41.365 --> 11:43.045
It's like living in a harem,

11:43.925 --> 11:47.605
where all the women fight
in order to be the Sultan's favorite.

11:49.525 --> 11:51.205
But the Sultan is never there.

11:54.645 --> 11:55.525
Never?

11:56.365 --> 11:57.565
I've never seen him.

12:02.885 --> 12:04.085
Don't you believe...

12:04.925 --> 12:05.925
in God?

12:21.925 --> 12:23.365
I don't believe in nuns.

12:23.845 --> 12:25.325
I don't believe in priests.

12:25.645 --> 12:28.965
Nor the Virgin Mary, nor the Holy Spirit,
especially not that.

12:31.165 --> 12:33.085
And... I don't believe in God.

12:35.245 --> 12:36.125
And you?

12:39.525 --> 12:40.525
I don't know.

12:43.005 --> 12:45.085
I only believe in things that move.

12:47.005 --> 12:48.205
I believe in horses.

12:48.765 --> 12:50.245
I'd do anything to have one.

12:50.765 --> 12:53.845
What about mice? And cats and dogs,
do you believe in them?

12:53.925 --> 12:56.765
In pigeons and in snails.

12:57.165 --> 12:59.685
And in ants, in everything.

13:10.925 --> 13:12.405
You should go home.

13:14.405 --> 13:16.525
And you have to go back to the nuns.

13:16.685 --> 13:17.565
Yes.

13:20.725 --> 13:22.125
See you tomorrow, then.

13:23.445 --> 13:24.525
See you tomorrow.

13:28.565 --> 13:29.885
Have a nice evening.

13:29.965 --> 13:32.565
-Don't forget an umbrella tomorrow.
-No.

14:27.685 --> 14:28.805
Who was the girl...

14:29.525 --> 14:30.685
that accompanied you?

14:32.565 --> 14:33.645
She's from school.

14:35.645 --> 14:36.485
Elisa.

14:39.485 --> 14:41.445
She helped me find the classroom.

14:44.445 --> 14:45.765
Her aunt is the headmistress.

14:55.685 --> 14:57.365
There are husks in the soup.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.805
I strained it three times.

15:01.205 --> 15:02.245
You strained it?

15:17.325 --> 15:20.725
In this school, you must learn, yes,
but not too much.

15:21.685 --> 15:23.645
Not too much, just enough.

15:57.565 --> 15:58.605
Hello, Elisa.

15:59.005 --> 16:00.005
Hello, Elisa.

16:01.165 --> 16:02.525
Good morning, Elisa.

16:02.845 --> 16:04.125
Good morning, Elisa.

16:05.445 --> 16:06.765
How are you, Elisa?

16:07.925 --> 16:09.525
Hello, Elisa. How are you?

16:20.845 --> 16:21.765
Elisa...

16:22.365 --> 16:23.205
Elisa...

16:24.525 --> 16:26.285
Elisa, Elisa, Elisa...

16:26.365 --> 16:27.725
Elisa, Elisa...

17:04.285 --> 17:05.725
You didn't listen to me.

17:08.405 --> 17:09.285
No.

17:12.845 --> 17:13.765
I forgot.

17:59.525 --> 18:03.165
This Christian victory
beside the Cave of Covadonga

18:03.245 --> 18:06.245
is the result of bravery
and the Christian faith,

18:06.325 --> 18:09.285
which nourished the Christian soldiers,

18:09.365 --> 18:13.365
who were capable of defeating
the Moorish troops,

18:13.725 --> 18:15.365
who, I'd say, were barbarians.

18:15.445 --> 18:18.605
<i>Isabel and Fernando</i>

18:19.365 --> 18:22.845
<i>Were excellent monarchs</i>

18:23.245 --> 18:26.445
<i>-They kicked out of Spain...</i>
-Do you want to see my bedroom?

18:26.525 --> 18:29.565
<i>The dark-skinned Moors</i>

18:29.645 --> 18:30.525
Now?

18:31.525 --> 18:32.525
If not now, when?

18:44.485 --> 18:45.325
Elisa...

18:47.085 --> 18:48.125
Who are you with?

18:49.125 --> 18:51.285
Marcela, she's new at the school,
Sister Clara.

18:51.365 --> 18:52.965
Ah, and what is she like?

18:54.765 --> 18:56.125
She's...

18:57.765 --> 18:58.765
a redhead.

18:59.365 --> 19:00.925
Or carrot-colored, rather.

19:01.245 --> 19:02.725
She has lots of freckles.

19:03.365 --> 19:04.925
And she's very fat!

19:05.925 --> 19:07.245
-Are you sure?
-And lame!

19:10.685 --> 19:12.965
If I didn't know you, Elisa...

19:13.845 --> 19:15.245
If I didn't know you!

19:24.165 --> 19:25.965
This is where I read and draw.

19:27.725 --> 19:29.365
At least they leave me alone.

19:32.685 --> 19:33.925
Do you want me to go?

19:34.245 --> 19:35.565
No, not you, please.

19:36.125 --> 19:38.005
I meant the nuns and my aunt.

19:43.085 --> 19:45.285
Do you know
what they're always telling me?

19:45.925 --> 19:46.805
No.

19:47.685 --> 19:50.005
That I should find a man
and get married soon.

19:50.085 --> 19:52.765
If I don't, I'll have to stay
with them here forever.

19:53.845 --> 19:56.045
They tell me that day in, day out.

20:05.485 --> 20:08.205
My dad tells me not to waste
too much time at school.

20:09.005 --> 20:11.365
And that teachers have a bad reputation.

20:12.605 --> 20:15.565
And that I should get married now
before I get pregnant.

20:21.165 --> 20:22.645
And what do you tell him?

20:29.805 --> 20:31.765
And you, what do you tell them?

20:32.965 --> 20:34.285
I asked first.

20:39.365 --> 20:41.005
I tell them...

20:43.885 --> 20:45.565
I tell them what they want to hear.

20:48.725 --> 20:49.645
Me too.

20:53.005 --> 20:57.325
But instead of marrying a man,
I'd rather do anything else, anything.

21:10.885 --> 21:13.045
I don't know
if I want to get married or not.

21:14.445 --> 21:15.405
Dear me!

21:16.365 --> 21:18.605
There are lots of things
you don't know, right?

21:18.885 --> 21:21.845
If you believe in God,
if you want to get married.

21:23.605 --> 21:25.805
Is there anything you are sure about?

21:54.325 --> 21:56.565
I know that I was in an orphanage
until I was ten.

21:59.365 --> 22:01.965
Sleeping with 40 other girls
in potato sacks.

22:03.285 --> 22:05.485
With rats crawling where they please.

22:09.805 --> 22:12.485
Eating watered-down soup
full of dead spiders.

22:13.445 --> 22:14.885
Seeing nothing but misery...

22:15.565 --> 22:16.525
and filth.

22:18.165 --> 22:19.245
And masses.

22:20.885 --> 22:22.525
One morning, all of a sudden,

22:23.285 --> 22:25.445
a woman came who said she was my mother.

22:26.205 --> 22:27.365
My real mother.

22:29.885 --> 22:32.605
She took me to a house
with a man who said he was my father.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.885
They never hugged me,

22:41.685 --> 22:45.125
nor told me why for ten years
I had thought they were dead.

22:49.885 --> 22:51.485
I don't know if they're my parents.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.565
So, if I don't even know that,

22:56.245 --> 22:58.325
how can I know if I believe in God?

22:58.925 --> 23:00.565
Or in marriage? Or anything?

23:02.125 --> 23:03.485
Forgive me, Marcela...

23:05.045 --> 23:06.005
I didn't know.

23:09.965 --> 23:11.805
-I'm going to class.
-I'm sorry.

23:12.885 --> 23:14.085
Will you forgive me?

23:42.805 --> 23:43.725
Good evening.

23:43.805 --> 23:45.765
I'm Elisa, Marcela's classmate.

23:45.845 --> 23:49.085
She lent me this book this morning
and I came to give it back. Can I...

23:49.165 --> 23:50.845
-I'll give it to her.
-Thank you.

23:50.925 --> 23:52.765
-Good night.
-Good night.

23:56.845 --> 23:59.325
From that classmate of yours.

23:59.765 --> 24:01.485
You left it behind, she said.

24:13.565 --> 24:16.165
Some books bring us nothing good.

25:05.485 --> 25:06.645
"Dear Marcela,

25:07.405 --> 25:09.685
I would never deliberately hurt you.

25:10.085 --> 25:11.005
I swear.

25:12.285 --> 25:13.245
Believe me.

25:14.125 --> 25:15.685
Believe me and forgive me.

25:16.045 --> 25:17.405
Yours, Elisa."

25:27.685 --> 25:29.165
"Yours, Elisa."

25:34.845 --> 25:35.805
Marcela.

25:43.645 --> 25:45.165
Your father is wrong.

25:48.205 --> 25:49.285
Books...

25:51.205 --> 25:52.125
What?

25:53.645 --> 25:54.805
What about books?

25:55.005 --> 25:56.565
I read in secret...

25:57.085 --> 25:58.725
when your father doesn't see me.

25:59.565 --> 26:00.565
That's not true.

26:17.925 --> 26:19.405
Emilia Pardo Bazán.

26:32.765 --> 26:35.885
THE BURNING QUESTION

26:42.885 --> 26:44.085
-I dreamt...
-I dreamt...

26:47.245 --> 26:48.885
-You first.
-No, you.

26:51.005 --> 26:52.325
I had a dream about you.

26:54.525 --> 26:55.485
No way.

26:56.165 --> 26:57.605
I had a dream about you.

26:59.445 --> 27:00.325
Really?

27:02.685 --> 27:03.565
Yes.

27:20.485 --> 27:22.205
You won't tell me your dream?

27:23.005 --> 27:23.885
No.

27:24.325 --> 27:25.245
Never.

27:27.605 --> 27:28.485
And you?

27:31.525 --> 27:32.525
Me neither.

27:44.685 --> 27:47.325
Do you know something
I've been thinking my whole life?

27:50.445 --> 27:51.365
What?

27:59.725 --> 28:01.285
Sometimes I walk here.

28:02.805 --> 28:04.245
I go close to the water.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.565
Then I close my eyes and dream.

28:09.325 --> 28:10.325
You dream?

28:14.365 --> 28:16.805
I dream that I'm riding a horse,

28:17.125 --> 28:18.325
and I cross the sea.

28:19.285 --> 28:20.965
Then I reach the shore...

28:22.005 --> 28:23.125
and it's Argentina.

28:26.365 --> 28:29.045
And I keep riding the horse
for a long time...

28:30.125 --> 28:31.445
without getting tired.

28:40.845 --> 28:43.965
It's an absurd dream,
because I've never ridden a horse and...

28:44.045 --> 28:45.645
I'm very scared of the sea.

29:07.565 --> 29:09.765
But... What are you doing?

30:26.605 --> 30:27.965
This is real, isn't it?

30:29.365 --> 30:30.445
It isn't a dream?

30:32.485 --> 30:34.445
It isn't this cold in dreams.

31:02.925 --> 31:05.605
You should go.
It's a long way back to school.

31:05.685 --> 31:06.885
I don't mind.

31:09.085 --> 31:10.085
See you tomorrow.

31:10.525 --> 31:11.365
Marcela, I...

31:12.005 --> 31:14.165
-There are so many things--
-Elisa.

31:15.325 --> 31:17.005
They're waiting for me inside.

31:19.405 --> 31:20.525
Let me tell you one.

31:24.445 --> 31:25.325
What?

31:30.925 --> 31:32.125
If I died right now,

31:33.045 --> 31:35.205
that moment with you in the sea...

31:38.805 --> 31:40.845
would be the happiest moment of my life.

31:48.965 --> 31:50.805
One day, I'll buy you a horse.

32:28.085 --> 32:29.125
Let her go.

32:29.205 --> 32:31.685
-She’ll stay to take care of you.
-She's studying.

32:31.765 --> 32:33.445
-I'm fine, really.
-Enough.

32:37.565 --> 32:40.845
No way. Don't even think
about going to school today.

32:41.365 --> 32:42.245
Why not?

32:42.325 --> 32:44.365
You'll look after your mother,
she's not well.

32:44.445 --> 32:47.485
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. Let her go.

32:47.565 --> 32:49.205
Marcela is staying here today.

32:50.645 --> 32:51.645
That's final.

32:56.205 --> 33:00.045
In Portugal, there are
three main natural regions,

33:00.125 --> 33:03.885
the north, the center, and the south,

33:03.965 --> 33:06.845
which consists of the Alentejo
and the Algarve.

33:06.925 --> 33:08.205
The northern region

33:08.285 --> 33:11.245
is located between the Minho Province
and the Serra da Estrela.

34:26.285 --> 34:27.405
You know something?

34:30.045 --> 34:32.125
My body is covered in moles.

34:40.285 --> 34:41.405
And one day...

34:43.485 --> 34:44.965
will you let me see them?

35:16.965 --> 35:17.805
Wait here.

35:22.005 --> 35:25.925
"Darkness didn't allow anything to be seen
other than its imposing outline,

35:26.005 --> 35:29.445
hiding the lines and details
in the darkness of the night."

35:31.205 --> 35:33.085
Who's this? What is she doing here?

35:33.685 --> 35:34.565
This is Elisa.

35:36.405 --> 35:38.045
She brought me my homework.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.805
Seeing as I didn't go to school today.

35:42.805 --> 35:43.685
Leave.

36:06.045 --> 36:06.925
Daughter.

36:09.205 --> 36:10.725
You and I need to talk.

36:11.765 --> 36:12.605
About what?

36:13.165 --> 36:15.365
-I can't miss class.
-Yes, you can.

36:16.205 --> 36:18.245
As your education is so important to you,

36:18.325 --> 36:22.165
your mother and I are sending you
to boarding school... in Madrid.

36:22.445 --> 36:24.165
It's a good place, my child.

36:24.245 --> 36:26.285
You'll learn a lot more
than you will here.

36:26.365 --> 36:28.045
In three years, you'll be a teacher.

36:28.125 --> 36:30.805
Boarding school or a convent, you decide.

36:30.885 --> 36:34.165
I would have chosen a convent,
but your mother insisted.

36:34.245 --> 36:36.285
-Where are you going?
-Let go!

36:36.365 --> 36:37.725
Get off! Let go of me!

36:37.805 --> 36:40.005
-Stop it right there!
-Let go!

36:43.285 --> 36:44.205
Let go of me!

37:18.125 --> 37:19.365
<i>Dear Marcela,</i>

37:20.365 --> 37:21.605
<i>Four weeks,</i>

37:22.045 --> 37:23.605
<i>three days, and nine hours</i>

37:24.085 --> 37:26.525
have passed since the last time
I could smell you.

37:27.325 --> 37:30.325
Yet, I feel you are so close to me
in my thoughts...

37:31.445 --> 37:33.245
that I could almost touch you.

37:34.885 --> 37:36.485
<i>Everything reminds me of you.</i>

37:37.245 --> 37:38.125
<i>Everything.</i>

37:39.005 --> 37:40.045
<i>The children.</i>

37:40.725 --> 37:41.685
<i>My aunt.</i>

37:41.925 --> 37:43.125
<i>The nuns.</i>

37:44.885 --> 37:45.925
<i>The sun.</i>

37:46.365 --> 37:48.045
<i>The rain, the sea.</i>

37:48.845 --> 37:49.685
<i>The sand.</i>

37:51.045 --> 37:54.525
<i>This blank paper that I fill with words</i>
<i>that take me to you.</i>

37:56.445 --> 37:57.485
<i>The quill.</i>

37:58.565 --> 37:59.565
<i>The ink.</i>

38:01.725 --> 38:03.525
I often dream of you, Marcela.

38:05.205 --> 38:06.405
Even when I'm awake.

38:08.445 --> 38:09.485
I draw you.

38:09.845 --> 38:12.645
And so, wherever I look, I find you.

38:14.365 --> 38:15.845
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

38:17.725 --> 38:18.725
<i>So much.</i>

38:23.925 --> 38:25.405
I want to kiss your mole.

38:30.365 --> 38:31.525
Always yours...

38:32.845 --> 38:33.805
Elisa.

38:35.365 --> 38:36.445
Dear Elisa,

38:37.805 --> 38:39.405
I've just read your letter.

38:40.245 --> 38:42.765
Reading your words is the closest thing
to touching you.

38:44.885 --> 38:47.965
Some days, I imagine me by your side
while you write.

38:48.365 --> 38:49.685
While you write to me.

38:50.725 --> 38:51.805
And I watch you.

38:53.925 --> 38:55.885
I watch each gesture.

38:56.885 --> 38:58.525
Each word that you give me.

39:00.085 --> 39:01.885
And I look closely at your hands.

39:02.885 --> 39:04.045
At your moles.

39:06.005 --> 39:07.245
At your pauses.

39:08.605 --> 39:09.725
At your haste.

39:11.205 --> 39:12.165
And mine.

39:15.365 --> 39:19.125
I imagine all our letters together
as if they were magic charms.

39:19.885 --> 39:22.365
And you and me naked, on top of them.

39:24.245 --> 39:26.925
As if all the words
that we've sent each other

39:27.445 --> 39:30.085
<i>could protect us from the cold,</i>

39:30.925 --> 39:31.765
<i>from people,</i>

39:33.205 --> 39:34.445
<i>from the distance.</i>

39:37.805 --> 39:40.005
Whenever one of your letters arrives,

39:40.525 --> 39:42.125
before I open it, I hug it.

39:43.565 --> 39:44.685
<i>I hug you.</i>

39:45.845 --> 39:48.045
<i>And your words calm my impatience,</i>

39:49.085 --> 39:50.645
<i>my fear of not seeing you,</i>

39:51.405 --> 39:53.525
<i>and the fear that one day</i>
<i>you'll stop writing.</i>

39:54.725 --> 39:56.965
<i>Your words of love penetrate my skin.</i>

39:58.645 --> 40:01.645
<i>I think that my moles are words from you.</i>

40:03.045 --> 40:04.605
<i>I love you so much, Elisa.</i>

40:07.125 --> 40:09.925
COUSO, GALICIA. THREE YEARS LATER

40:10.005 --> 40:11.125
<i>The chestnut...</i>

40:12.845 --> 40:14.005
is a fruit...

40:19.885 --> 40:21.445
with a reddish shell.

40:27.965 --> 40:29.645
The shape of the chestnut...

40:35.845 --> 40:37.245
is very similar...

40:44.885 --> 40:46.245
to that of a heart.

40:58.965 --> 41:00.245
Draw a chestnut.

41:26.605 --> 41:29.805
Honestly! What did I tell you?
Have you finished drawing a chestnut?

41:29.885 --> 41:32.325
I have the quickest kids in all of Couso.

41:33.365 --> 41:34.605
Get back inside!

42:41.925 --> 42:43.325
Who is she?

42:55.765 --> 42:56.725
You.

48:10.845 --> 48:13.485
<i>-You've been with me all this time.</i>
<i>-All this time.</i>

48:13.565 --> 48:15.965
<i>-And you've been with me every minute.</i>
<i>-Every minute.</i>

48:17.845 --> 48:21.645
<i>You should apply for the school in Couso,</i>
<i>ten kilometers from mine.</i>

48:22.165 --> 48:24.165
<i>-Ten kilometers.</i>
<i>-Ten kilometers.</i>

48:24.445 --> 48:26.565
<i>Then I'll get them</i>
<i>to transfer me with you.</i>

48:26.645 --> 48:28.405
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Yes, with you.</i>

48:28.485 --> 48:29.365
<i>With me.</i>

48:30.965 --> 48:33.085
<i>-And we'll be together.</i>
<i>-And we'll be together.</i>

48:33.165 --> 48:34.045
<i>Together.</i>

48:34.125 --> 48:35.325
<i>-Together.</i>
<i>-Together.</i>

48:35.405 --> 48:37.005
<i>-Together.</i>
<i>-Forever.</i>

48:37.085 --> 48:38.365
<i>-Forever.</i>
<i>-Forever.</i>

48:38.805 --> 48:39.765
<i>Forever.</i>

48:40.365 --> 48:41.645
<i>-I love you.</i>
<i>-I love you.</i>

48:41.925 --> 48:43.365
<i>-I love you.</i>
<i>-I love you.</i>

48:53.565 --> 48:54.485
Good morning.

48:54.565 --> 48:56.205
Good morning!

48:57.525 --> 48:58.445
You may sit down.

48:58.525 --> 49:00.165
CALO, GALICIA. FEBRUARY, 1901

49:00.245 --> 49:02.885
I'm Miss Marcela, what are your names?

49:03.285 --> 49:04.125
I'm Pedro.

49:04.765 --> 49:05.605
I'm Rosa.

49:06.045 --> 49:07.325
My name is Celso.

49:07.405 --> 49:08.645
My name is Rocío.

49:08.725 --> 49:09.965
I'm Rosalía.

49:10.365 --> 49:12.925
And the tree?
Do you know what it is called?

49:16.805 --> 49:18.245
THE HOLY TRINITY

49:18.325 --> 49:19.805
GOD - HOLY SPIRIT - SON

49:41.925 --> 49:43.565
Look at those two birds.

49:43.645 --> 49:44.765
Can you give us a hand?

49:45.045 --> 49:47.125
-We don't bite.
-They're ill-tempered.

51:22.085 --> 51:22.965
The...

51:23.805 --> 51:25.645
body...

51:28.245 --> 51:29.205
of the...

51:32.045 --> 51:36.285
snail...

51:39.645 --> 51:40.525
is...

51:43.205 --> 51:45.285
soft.

52:22.405 --> 52:23.725
I knew you were here.

52:30.005 --> 52:32.045
I always know when you're near.

53:49.125 --> 53:50.245
What's that letter?

53:51.845 --> 53:53.085
My cousin, Mario.

53:53.885 --> 53:54.965
My aunt's son.

53:56.805 --> 53:58.125
He's drowned to death.

53:59.485 --> 54:00.445
Drowned?

54:01.925 --> 54:04.605
I hardly knew him,
he always lived in England.

54:06.125 --> 54:07.485
I was his only family.

54:11.165 --> 54:12.245
Shall we eat?

54:12.325 --> 54:14.085
Yes, I'm starving.

55:32.405 --> 55:33.365
May I?

55:38.285 --> 55:39.445
I don't dance.

55:40.325 --> 55:42.325
What do you mean, you don't dance?

55:42.565 --> 55:43.525
Just one.

55:45.565 --> 55:48.645
Don't worry about your friend,
I'll ask her next if you want.

56:49.285 --> 56:50.965
Sometimes I feel so scared.

56:52.685 --> 56:53.605
Elisa...

56:54.445 --> 56:56.045
We have to play along.

56:56.725 --> 56:58.685
Pretend we're like everyone else.

56:59.085 --> 57:00.645
That we're just like them.

57:02.125 --> 57:03.605
Or they won't leave us alone.

57:10.725 --> 57:11.765
You know that.

57:12.485 --> 57:13.365
I know.

58:17.125 --> 58:18.125
What a pair.

58:26.405 --> 58:30.965
-Have you seen those two?
-Yes. They're having so much fun, you see?

1:00:14.485 --> 1:00:15.525
What do you want?

1:00:21.445 --> 1:00:24.445
I wanted to ask Miss Marcela
to the dance next week.

1:00:27.205 --> 1:00:28.325
To go to the dance.

1:00:29.005 --> 1:00:30.525
Miss Marcela can't go.

1:00:33.085 --> 1:00:34.325
Let the lady tell me.

1:00:35.405 --> 1:00:37.085
Or are you in charge of her?

1:00:44.205 --> 1:00:45.045
Open the door!

1:00:49.045 --> 1:00:50.605
Open the door, you dyke.

1:00:56.725 --> 1:00:57.565
Lesbian.

1:01:04.005 --> 1:01:04.965
Marcela!

1:01:35.765 --> 1:01:38.245
Do you know what's happened
to your classmates?

1:01:40.765 --> 1:01:41.885
Are they sick?

1:01:50.685 --> 1:01:51.725
You may sit down.

1:02:41.845 --> 1:02:42.765
Come out!

1:04:08.565 --> 1:04:10.285
You know what we have to do, right?

1:04:11.965 --> 1:04:12.845
Yes.

1:04:14.765 --> 1:04:15.885
Are you sure?

1:04:18.165 --> 1:04:19.005
Yes.

1:04:24.325 --> 1:04:25.325
Do you love me?

1:04:28.805 --> 1:04:30.045
With all my soul.

1:05:24.125 --> 1:05:26.565
Marcela, it's not too late
to live another life.

1:05:27.285 --> 1:05:28.205
A life...

1:05:30.045 --> 1:05:31.005
that is normal.

1:05:32.765 --> 1:05:33.725
Be quiet.

1:05:36.725 --> 1:05:38.565
A normal life for me is with you.

1:05:42.365 --> 1:05:44.605
Nobody could ever give me what you do.

1:05:46.405 --> 1:05:47.325
Nobody.

1:05:49.525 --> 1:05:50.405
Ever.

1:06:00.405 --> 1:06:03.965
Afterwards, we'll go to Buenos Aires,
where nobody knows us.

1:06:07.885 --> 1:06:08.765
Yes.

1:06:16.405 --> 1:06:18.645
I haven't seen Elisa in days.

1:06:20.365 --> 1:06:21.205
She's left.

1:06:23.205 --> 1:06:25.205
Where to, may I ask?

1:06:26.885 --> 1:06:27.765
To Havana.

1:06:28.645 --> 1:06:29.965
With some relatives.

1:06:31.045 --> 1:06:32.445
She's already set sail.

1:06:41.205 --> 1:06:43.245
Goodbye. I'm going inside.

1:07:02.485 --> 1:07:03.325
Wait.

1:07:19.765 --> 1:07:21.405
They say your friend has left.

1:07:21.805 --> 1:07:22.645
Yes.

1:07:23.845 --> 1:07:25.005
A few days ago.

1:07:26.285 --> 1:07:27.205
To Cuba.

1:07:30.525 --> 1:07:31.725
Are you by yourself?

1:07:36.285 --> 1:07:38.205
And the firewood is running out.

1:07:40.565 --> 1:07:42.645
It was Elisa who took care of that.

1:07:44.765 --> 1:07:46.445
I could bring some firewood.

1:07:49.405 --> 1:07:50.325
Thank you.

1:07:53.205 --> 1:07:54.085
Today.

1:07:56.045 --> 1:07:56.965
Tonight.

1:08:36.565 --> 1:08:39.085
<i>There's a praised island</i>

1:08:39.725 --> 1:08:42.125
<i>There at the bottom of the sea</i>

1:08:43.165 --> 1:08:46.005
<i>It sails with bright stars</i>

1:08:47.045 --> 1:08:49.245
<i>The night makes it...</i>

1:10:06.885 --> 1:10:07.885
Mario.

1:10:10.085 --> 1:10:12.485
<i>I was born on the same day</i>
<i>as my cousin Elisa,</i>

1:10:12.565 --> 1:10:14.285
<i>but seven years later,</i>

1:10:14.365 --> 1:10:17.365
after my mother had already married
an English protestant.

1:10:17.445 --> 1:10:18.885
Saint George's Church, A Coruña

1:10:18.965 --> 1:10:21.085
This can't be, my son. It cannot be!

1:10:21.605 --> 1:10:24.965
I know, Father, I know,
but the circumstances...

1:10:26.725 --> 1:10:29.285
All the records were lost
and I was never baptized

1:10:29.365 --> 1:10:31.885
because my stepfather, Mr. Hobbs,
was opposed it.

1:10:32.485 --> 1:10:35.365
When I was eight, they took me to England,
and after that...

1:10:39.085 --> 1:10:41.005
Do you know what my dream is, Father?

1:10:43.685 --> 1:10:46.925
My only dream
now that I'm finally home is...

1:10:48.045 --> 1:10:50.885
to be baptized, and then marry Marcela.

1:10:51.085 --> 1:10:54.405
Immediately, my son. Tomorrow.

1:10:55.485 --> 1:10:57.125
-Really, Father?
-Yes.

1:11:23.365 --> 1:11:26.525
JUNE, 1901

1:11:26.605 --> 1:11:27.565
Mario...

1:11:28.125 --> 1:11:32.685
Do you take Marcela, here present,
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

1:11:32.765 --> 1:11:35.565
according to the rite
of our Holy Mother Church?

1:11:36.045 --> 1:11:37.845
If so, answer "I do."

1:11:39.965 --> 1:11:40.805
I do.

1:11:41.685 --> 1:11:42.765
Marcela...

1:11:43.685 --> 1:11:47.605
Do you take Mario, here present,
to be your lawfully wedded husband, 

1:11:47.685 --> 1:11:50.485
according to the rite
of our Holy Mother Church?

1:11:50.685 --> 1:11:53.045
If so, answer "I do."

1:11:54.885 --> 1:11:55.765
I do.

1:11:55.845 --> 1:11:57.885
I now declare you man and wife,

1:11:57.965 --> 1:11:59.525
in the name of the Father,

1:11:59.845 --> 1:12:00.965
the Son,

1:12:01.405 --> 1:12:04.085
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

1:12:04.165 --> 1:12:05.085
Amen.

1:13:50.725 --> 1:13:52.565
...and she will listen to me.

1:13:52.645 --> 1:13:53.645
Come on.

1:14:12.885 --> 1:14:14.205
What can I do for you?

1:14:14.285 --> 1:14:15.605
Marcela, my child...

1:14:16.365 --> 1:14:18.125
we heard that you got married.

1:14:18.485 --> 1:14:19.485
Yes, Father.

1:14:19.885 --> 1:14:20.885
In A Coruña.

1:14:21.885 --> 1:14:23.245
At St. George's Church.

1:14:23.645 --> 1:14:25.325
Father Cortiella married us.

1:14:27.205 --> 1:14:29.405
And... could we meet your husband?

1:14:31.645 --> 1:14:32.965
He's resting.

1:14:34.085 --> 1:14:35.285
It will just be a moment.

1:14:38.725 --> 1:14:40.365
Look, Marcela...

1:14:41.445 --> 1:14:42.925
We have been told that...

1:14:44.925 --> 1:14:46.605
as strange as this sounds...

1:14:49.805 --> 1:14:51.365
that you are married to...

1:14:52.965 --> 1:14:53.885
to Elisa.

1:14:54.525 --> 1:14:56.605
To Elisa dressed as a man.

1:14:57.965 --> 1:14:59.045
That's absurd!

1:14:59.405 --> 1:15:00.965
To Elisa dressed as a man?

1:15:02.605 --> 1:15:03.845
That's why you're all here?

1:15:06.605 --> 1:15:07.685
His name is Mario.

1:15:08.165 --> 1:15:09.405
He's Elisa's cousin.

1:15:10.845 --> 1:15:13.405
They're first cousins,
they look very alike.

1:15:13.765 --> 1:15:15.245
They're almost identical.

1:15:17.005 --> 1:15:19.165
-Anything else?
-You should ask him to come out.

1:15:20.565 --> 1:15:21.685
I ought to...

1:15:22.645 --> 1:15:23.765
examine him.

1:15:25.125 --> 1:15:26.805
Examine him closely.

1:15:28.485 --> 1:15:30.405
Why do you meddle in other people's lives?

1:15:31.965 --> 1:15:35.925
Is there no one who needs their last rites
or treatment for a cold?

1:15:38.525 --> 1:15:39.965
Want to know something, Father?

1:15:40.365 --> 1:15:43.965
Something that persuades you
that Mario is a man, and you as well.

1:15:45.125 --> 1:15:47.205
In a few months, you'll see for yourself.

1:15:48.285 --> 1:15:49.165
I'm having a baby.

1:15:50.925 --> 1:15:52.005
Mario's child,

1:15:52.085 --> 1:15:53.205
my husband's child.

1:15:54.445 --> 1:15:56.565
I hope you will baptize him, Father.

1:15:58.125 --> 1:15:59.285
Now leave.

1:15:59.365 --> 1:16:01.205
The weather is turning quite nasty.

1:16:27.205 --> 1:16:29.405
We'll have to leave
sooner than we thought.

1:16:38.005 --> 1:16:40.725
If only we could go
to Buenos Aires tomorrow.

1:17:12.885 --> 1:17:14.845
I'm tired, I'm going to lie down.

1:17:17.645 --> 1:17:19.525
Elisa, come out if you're a man!

1:17:19.605 --> 1:17:21.005
Come out, you whore!

1:17:21.085 --> 1:17:24.365
Whore! Come out, you whore!

1:17:28.245 --> 1:17:29.085
Whore!

1:17:34.205 --> 1:17:35.565
Whore!

1:17:38.205 --> 1:17:39.285
Are you all right?

1:18:21.485 --> 1:18:24.445
PASSENGER LIST

1:18:28.965 --> 1:18:31.405
I suppose you know why I sent for you.

1:18:33.925 --> 1:18:35.245
They're lies, Father.

1:18:35.805 --> 1:18:37.005
Nothing but lies.

1:18:37.965 --> 1:18:41.205
People in Dumbría invent all kinds
of things to damge our reputation.

1:18:43.325 --> 1:18:44.685
It's a blatant lie.

1:18:45.765 --> 1:18:48.365
Do you realize the position
you've put me in?

1:18:49.525 --> 1:18:52.125
Do you realize
that what you two have done...

1:18:53.405 --> 1:18:54.925
is a complete lie?

1:18:55.365 --> 1:18:59.445
And that you and that wretched woman
will both rot in hell!

1:19:04.565 --> 1:19:05.725
Father, please.

1:19:09.205 --> 1:19:10.725
I have no choice...

1:19:12.445 --> 1:19:14.205
but to do this, Mario,

1:19:15.285 --> 1:19:17.005
or whoever the hell you are!

1:19:18.205 --> 1:19:19.405
Guards!

1:19:39.045 --> 1:19:41.045
Father, I'll begin.

1:19:53.765 --> 1:19:55.645
Don't do this, Father, please.

1:19:56.045 --> 1:19:57.605
I beg you, don't do this.

1:19:57.685 --> 1:19:58.885
If you are a man...

1:19:59.565 --> 1:20:00.405
prove it.

1:20:08.365 --> 1:20:09.325
Please.

1:20:09.605 --> 1:20:10.605
No!

1:20:13.485 --> 1:20:16.405
I'm a hermaphrodite, I swear!
I'm a hermaphrodite!

1:20:16.565 --> 1:20:18.085
Damn you, woman.

1:20:18.365 --> 1:20:20.645
The fury of all the archangels

1:20:20.725 --> 1:20:22.965
shall fall on you and on your...

1:20:24.165 --> 1:20:25.365
on that woman!

1:20:34.725 --> 1:20:35.805
She's my wife...

1:20:37.725 --> 1:20:39.165
and her name is Marcela.

1:20:42.005 --> 1:20:44.365
<i>Read the story of Elisa and Marcela,</i>

1:20:44.445 --> 1:20:45.925
a marriage without a man.

1:21:06.925 --> 1:21:07.805
Look at this.

1:21:08.845 --> 1:21:10.925
This isn't what human beings do.

1:21:17.645 --> 1:21:18.965
Did you see this?

1:21:19.045 --> 1:21:21.165
What about the priest?

1:21:23.845 --> 1:21:24.685
It's astonishing.

1:21:24.765 --> 1:21:25.685
Good evening.

1:21:41.965 --> 1:21:43.285
Okay, all in order.

1:21:45.645 --> 1:21:46.485
You can go.

1:21:46.565 --> 1:21:48.285
Good night. You may go on.

1:21:48.365 --> 1:21:49.685
Good night. Thank you.

1:22:51.565 --> 1:22:57.965
PORTO. DECEMBER, 1901

1:23:23.365 --> 1:23:24.965
The chicken! In the oven!

1:23:25.205 --> 1:23:26.405
The cod is ready!

1:23:32.485 --> 1:23:34.125
Hey, hey!

1:23:35.085 --> 1:23:37.285
What's this? Wake up!

1:23:51.765 --> 1:23:53.245
How much are we short?

1:23:56.805 --> 1:23:58.485
We've got enough for one fare.

1:24:06.165 --> 1:24:07.325
In two months...

1:24:13.285 --> 1:24:14.365
Two months.

1:24:33.285 --> 1:24:37.005
<i>Severa has passed away</i>

1:24:37.565 --> 1:24:41.485
<i>Severa has passed away</i>

1:24:42.525 --> 1:24:45.845
<i>Severa has passed away</i>

1:24:46.565 --> 1:24:50.205
<i>Severa has passed away</i>

1:24:51.085 --> 1:24:54.685
<i>And the streets of Mouraria</i>

1:24:55.245 --> 1:24:59.445
<i>Weep with anger and pain</i>

1:24:59.965 --> 1:25:03.245
<i>And the streets of Mouraria</i>

1:25:03.845 --> 1:25:07.925
<i>Weep with anger and pain</i>

1:25:08.285 --> 1:25:11.685
<i>A black shawl, a black shawl</i>

1:25:12.205 --> 1:25:15.885
<i>Black like the new moon</i>

1:25:17.085 --> 1:25:20.765
<i>A black shawl, a black shawl</i>

1:25:21.405 --> 1:25:24.925
<i>Black like the new moon</i>

1:25:25.685 --> 1:25:29.245
<i>As black as the darkest night</i>

1:25:29.605 --> 1:25:32.245
<i>As black as the darkest night</i>

1:26:01.405 --> 1:26:04.845
You two are under arrest
in the name of the Portuguese government.

1:26:05.805 --> 1:26:06.925
No.

1:26:07.845 --> 1:26:09.325
She hasn't done anything!

1:26:11.645 --> 1:26:13.125
She hasn't done anything!

1:26:19.525 --> 1:26:20.845
Be careful, she's...

1:26:20.925 --> 1:26:22.485
Shut up and keep moving!

1:27:23.685 --> 1:27:24.765
Come on, walk!

1:27:28.565 --> 1:27:33.925
Here I have a lawsuit
from the Court of A Coruña...

1:27:35.085 --> 1:27:39.325
which says that you are
a woman called Elisa,

1:27:40.445 --> 1:27:43.605
and that, with a false identity,

1:27:43.685 --> 1:27:47.165
you managed to get married to Marcela...

1:27:48.365 --> 1:27:49.485
and entered Portugal.

1:27:51.445 --> 1:27:52.325
I'm Mario.

1:27:54.725 --> 1:27:56.445
Please, I don't have all day.

1:27:57.965 --> 1:28:02.765
What is this comedy that you
and this woman have concocted?

1:28:03.165 --> 1:28:05.085
That woman is my wife.

1:28:06.365 --> 1:28:11.605
You Spaniards are always so stubborn,
so pig-headed, so loud-mouthed.

1:28:18.165 --> 1:28:20.765
Please, sir, she... my wife...

1:28:21.885 --> 1:28:23.805
has nothing to do with all this.

1:28:24.485 --> 1:28:25.565
She knows nothing.

1:28:26.085 --> 1:28:28.765
She thinks that I'm a hermaphrodite,
that I...

1:28:30.285 --> 1:28:31.725
Please, stop,

1:28:31.805 --> 1:28:34.765
Elisa, Mario, whatever your name is.

1:28:35.365 --> 1:28:38.885
I'm not an ignorant parish priest
from a village in Galicia

1:28:38.965 --> 1:28:42.165
who you and your friend
can fool that easily.

1:28:46.885 --> 1:28:49.445
If I tell the guards right now...

1:28:50.005 --> 1:28:52.405
to take you to the men's prison cell,

1:28:53.245 --> 1:28:56.485
how long do you think it will take them
to find out what you are?

1:28:57.765 --> 1:28:58.765
How long?

1:29:06.765 --> 1:29:07.645
Not long...

1:29:08.565 --> 1:29:09.525
I guess.

1:29:28.365 --> 1:29:29.765
Are you pregnant?

1:29:32.045 --> 1:29:32.965
Yes?

1:29:33.605 --> 1:29:34.645
Come.

1:29:35.165 --> 1:29:36.125
Come here.

1:29:44.085 --> 1:29:45.005
Eat.

1:30:10.845 --> 1:30:12.405
What will happen to us?

1:30:16.685 --> 1:30:18.045
What are we accused of?

1:30:19.285 --> 1:30:20.645
Transvestism.

1:30:23.205 --> 1:30:24.325
Blasphemy.

1:30:27.525 --> 1:30:29.525
Falsifying documents.

1:30:30.805 --> 1:30:33.365
And your friend is accused
of being an accomplice.

1:30:33.725 --> 1:30:36.005
That's just across the border.

1:30:36.605 --> 1:30:39.445
But first, you have to answer
the charges on this side.

1:30:40.005 --> 1:30:41.405
You'll be tried here,

1:30:41.605 --> 1:30:45.325
and then transferred to Galicia.

1:30:48.685 --> 1:30:51.925
It's all my fault.
Marcela is innocent, I swear.

1:30:56.565 --> 1:30:58.205
She's expecting a child.

1:31:01.565 --> 1:31:02.605
A child?

1:31:09.965 --> 1:31:11.405
Put a dress on.

1:31:11.565 --> 1:31:14.165
I'll tell them to put you
in the women's building.

1:31:24.325 --> 1:31:25.565
Can I be with her?

1:31:26.125 --> 1:31:27.005
Yes.

1:31:30.885 --> 1:31:31.805
Thank you.

1:31:34.685 --> 1:31:36.205
You're a good person.

1:31:36.725 --> 1:31:37.725
You're welcome.

1:31:37.805 --> 1:31:40.925
That's what my wife says
when she's about to upset me.

1:31:42.325 --> 1:31:43.605
Go, go, go.

1:31:44.365 --> 1:31:45.325
Leave.

1:31:45.405 --> 1:31:47.405
Before I regret it

1:31:47.485 --> 1:31:49.565
and lock you up with those savages.

1:31:59.085 --> 1:31:59.965
Go on.

1:32:19.605 --> 1:32:20.685
Marcela.

1:32:26.645 --> 1:32:27.605
Mario.

1:32:29.485 --> 1:32:30.565
I'm Elisa.

1:32:35.845 --> 1:32:36.805
Elisa.

1:33:12.165 --> 1:33:13.765
What's going to happen now?

1:33:25.965 --> 1:33:26.965
I don't know.

1:33:44.125 --> 1:33:45.725
But we're together.

1:33:50.045 --> 1:33:51.205
Together, yes.

1:34:02.005 --> 1:34:03.165
Forgive me.

1:34:10.565 --> 1:34:12.325
I said I would protect you...

1:34:13.685 --> 1:34:16.005
-and look where we are.
-No, Elisa, shh.

1:34:18.445 --> 1:34:20.125
You don't have to apologize.

1:34:27.565 --> 1:34:28.885
We'll get out of here.

1:34:34.285 --> 1:34:36.645
We should have left a long time ago.

1:34:44.085 --> 1:34:45.165
Maybe.

1:34:51.645 --> 1:34:53.925
I'm scared that our baby
will be born here.

1:35:03.005 --> 1:35:04.645
The warden will help us.

1:35:06.605 --> 1:35:08.165
He seems to be a good man.

1:35:12.445 --> 1:35:14.725
We need more than just a good man.

1:35:38.165 --> 1:35:39.085
Keep still.

1:35:43.565 --> 1:35:44.485
Perfect.

1:35:45.365 --> 1:35:46.325
Ready?

1:36:03.245 --> 1:36:06.325
Have you read about
those two women that got married?

1:36:07.245 --> 1:36:12.445
If we send them back to Spain, they'll be
sentenced to prison for 20 years.

1:36:21.205 --> 1:36:24.125
It was made with great affection.
Please give this to them.

1:36:24.205 --> 1:36:25.805
Of course, I'll deliver it to them.

1:36:25.885 --> 1:36:28.365
I have a gift for the child
of the Spanish women.

1:36:28.445 --> 1:36:30.285
Please give them this.

1:36:35.605 --> 1:36:36.805
It brings good luck.

1:36:41.885 --> 1:36:44.845
That's enough touching.
Let's have some order here.

1:36:48.765 --> 1:36:49.645
Elisa...

1:36:56.685 --> 1:36:57.605
It's coming!

1:37:01.005 --> 1:37:02.085
Are you sure?

1:37:02.805 --> 1:37:03.725
Yes.

1:37:09.245 --> 1:37:11.365
There's the head. It's coming!

1:37:11.445 --> 1:37:13.245
Breathe.

1:37:13.405 --> 1:37:16.285
Look, here it comes! Go, push.

1:37:17.645 --> 1:37:20.245
Push hard! Come on!

1:37:21.885 --> 1:37:24.965
Now, this is it. One last time!

1:37:51.685 --> 1:37:53.005
So much hair!

1:37:53.085 --> 1:37:53.925
Right?

1:37:54.965 --> 1:37:56.685
Hello.

1:38:13.845 --> 1:38:15.525
Oh, nice and healthy.

1:38:16.205 --> 1:38:17.805
A girl. It's a girl.

1:38:17.885 --> 1:38:19.245
What's her name?

1:38:19.525 --> 1:38:21.325
-Ana.
-Oh, she's beautiful.

1:38:21.445 --> 1:38:24.325
GOVERNOR'S PALACE, PORTO

1:38:25.045 --> 1:38:28.805
Commissioner, what's this story about
the two Spanish women that got married?

1:38:28.885 --> 1:38:32.245
My wife won't stop going on about it.

1:38:34.085 --> 1:38:36.405
She even wants to visit them in prison.

1:38:37.765 --> 1:38:39.485
They've had a lot of visitors,

1:38:39.565 --> 1:38:40.525
that is true.

1:38:42.125 --> 1:38:44.605
The Spanish authorities are pressuring me.

1:38:45.565 --> 1:38:47.485
They want to try them in A Coruña.

1:38:47.845 --> 1:38:50.445
I think they want to make
an example of them both.

1:38:51.685 --> 1:38:54.885
They're not criminals,
they're two women who are--

1:38:54.965 --> 1:38:55.885
Stupid.

1:38:59.085 --> 1:39:00.725
This cod is so bland.

1:39:04.645 --> 1:39:06.085
What's the current situation?

1:39:07.445 --> 1:39:09.645
One of them gave birth
to a baby girl in prison.

1:39:10.045 --> 1:39:11.285
Gave birth in prison?

1:39:12.325 --> 1:39:13.565
Just what we needed.

1:39:16.005 --> 1:39:16.885
Governor...

1:39:17.485 --> 1:39:20.085
If we hand them over
to the Spanish authorities,

1:39:20.165 --> 1:39:22.005
they'll get ten to 20 years in jail.

1:39:29.165 --> 1:39:33.605
Can I count on your esteemed help
so that doesn't happen?

1:39:34.365 --> 1:39:35.965
Done legally, of course.

1:39:36.965 --> 1:39:39.565
Even if it's just to annoy the Spanish.

1:39:42.325 --> 1:39:44.725
Your Excellency, count on me.

1:39:48.765 --> 1:39:50.805
Try this cod
and tell me if it isn't bland.

1:39:50.885 --> 1:39:52.005
No, thank you, Governor.

1:40:08.205 --> 1:40:10.525
We have enough for both fares, Marcela.

1:40:11.605 --> 1:40:13.525
As soon as we get out of here...

1:40:14.685 --> 1:40:17.325
If we leave here,
they'll hand us over to the authorities.

1:40:24.605 --> 1:40:26.205
Something's wrong with her.

1:40:26.365 --> 1:40:27.285
It's the humidity...

1:40:28.845 --> 1:40:29.845
and this place.

1:40:37.605 --> 1:40:38.605
Give her to me.

1:40:38.685 --> 1:40:39.565
No.

1:40:42.005 --> 1:40:43.005
What's wrong?

1:40:46.325 --> 1:40:48.525
Come here.

1:40:55.045 --> 1:40:56.085
She's burning up.

1:41:02.005 --> 1:41:03.085
A doctor!

1:41:03.605 --> 1:41:05.405
We need a doctor!

1:41:06.565 --> 1:41:08.165
It's the baby! A doctor!

1:41:22.565 --> 1:41:23.765
Shh, calm down.

1:41:35.765 --> 1:41:36.765
Listen...

1:41:38.525 --> 1:41:39.925
The baby has pneumonia.

1:41:40.365 --> 1:41:42.765
We have to lower her fever or she'll die.

1:41:42.845 --> 1:41:44.805
They can come with me to my house.

1:41:46.885 --> 1:41:48.125
Let's go to my house.

1:42:29.445 --> 1:42:30.445
Get some sleep.

1:42:43.205 --> 1:42:45.165
-Well?
-How are they?

1:42:45.685 --> 1:42:47.005
I think she's out of danger.

1:42:48.685 --> 1:42:49.965
Now they're sleeping.

1:42:54.285 --> 1:42:55.885
The baby is very beautiful.

1:42:57.405 --> 1:43:00.045
I can't thank you enough
for everything you've done for us.

1:43:01.525 --> 1:43:03.045
It's a privilege to have met you.

1:43:05.445 --> 1:43:07.085
Most people wouldn't say that.

1:43:08.605 --> 1:43:10.525
We're not most people.

1:43:11.285 --> 1:43:12.125
Right?

1:43:15.165 --> 1:43:16.045
Right.

1:43:19.485 --> 1:43:20.885
You don't have children?

1:43:21.365 --> 1:43:22.205
No.

1:43:47.885 --> 1:43:50.645
I can't detain you two any longer, Elisa.

1:43:52.245 --> 1:43:54.645
But if I let you go, you'll be deported.

1:43:54.725 --> 1:43:55.645
I know.

1:44:08.565 --> 1:44:10.285
If I were to let you go...

1:44:10.925 --> 1:44:12.365
This is only an example.

1:44:13.205 --> 1:44:15.805
...the day before the boat leaves.

1:44:16.125 --> 1:44:19.525
And on the release papers,
I put a date of, let's say...

1:44:20.485 --> 1:44:22.325
two days later.

1:44:27.005 --> 1:44:29.565
But first we have to let them recover.

1:44:30.285 --> 1:44:31.165
Yes.

1:44:35.045 --> 1:44:37.365
Oh, you earn more.

1:44:37.445 --> 1:44:39.045
More money coming in.

1:44:39.845 --> 1:44:41.405
The others don't matter.

1:44:43.045 --> 1:44:45.405
We have to find a way to resolve things.

1:44:55.365 --> 1:44:56.325
Where's Ana?

1:45:02.565 --> 1:45:03.525
She's with Flor.

1:45:06.845 --> 1:45:09.765
I asked her to take care of her
until we're ready.

1:45:20.525 --> 1:45:21.845
Marcela, are you okay?

1:45:22.645 --> 1:45:24.005
Is something wrong?

1:45:29.885 --> 1:45:31.885
I thought you'd be happy
that we're leaving.

1:45:32.365 --> 1:45:33.325
I am.

1:45:34.365 --> 1:45:35.285
Believe me.

1:45:40.245 --> 1:45:41.365
You don't seem it.

1:45:49.765 --> 1:45:51.965
Soon we'll be out of this prison.

1:45:56.245 --> 1:45:57.445
This prison is fine.

1:46:02.165 --> 1:46:03.845
The problem is what's outside.

1:46:06.445 --> 1:46:08.245
Where we are carnival freaks.

1:46:12.165 --> 1:46:13.725
Where people stare at us.

1:46:14.645 --> 1:46:16.005
Where they laugh at us.

1:46:20.845 --> 1:46:22.285
Where there's no escape.

1:46:25.125 --> 1:46:26.565
And there never will be.

1:46:32.005 --> 1:46:34.205
That's why we got married
and came up with Mario.

1:46:34.285 --> 1:46:35.885
That's why I had my daughter.

1:46:40.045 --> 1:46:42.005
I thought they'd believe us then.

1:46:47.685 --> 1:46:49.445
How could I do this to my daughter?

1:46:52.925 --> 1:46:54.045
How could I?

1:47:02.645 --> 1:47:04.005
-My love...
-Elisa.

1:47:27.445 --> 1:47:28.405
Listen to me.

1:47:33.805 --> 1:47:36.325
Despite the fact
that I love you more than my own life,

1:47:40.085 --> 1:47:42.925
if you choose to stay here
with your daughter, I'll understand.

1:47:44.165 --> 1:47:46.725
I'll wait for you forever, Marcela.
Forever.

1:47:56.725 --> 1:47:58.285
Don't you understand?

1:48:03.405 --> 1:48:06.445
She's the one I'm leaving behind. Her.

1:48:27.285 --> 1:48:28.205
Thank you.

1:48:35.445 --> 1:48:38.925
Elisa, tell her that we'll tell the child
who her mother is.

1:48:39.885 --> 1:48:41.085
Yes, I'll tell her.

1:48:44.565 --> 1:48:45.565
Look after her...

1:48:46.485 --> 1:48:47.925
and look after yourself.

1:50:28.245 --> 1:50:30.285
I hated you, you know?

1:50:34.925 --> 1:50:36.565
For many years.

1:50:39.245 --> 1:50:42.085
-I can imagine.
-But they were very good parents.

1:50:43.325 --> 1:50:44.485
The best.

1:50:50.325 --> 1:50:51.565
I knew they would be.

1:51:00.085 --> 1:51:01.365
Was it worth it?

1:51:03.965 --> 1:51:04.965
All this?

1:51:07.045 --> 1:51:09.285
The wedding, the mockery?

1:51:11.045 --> 1:51:12.085
Going to prison?

1:51:14.485 --> 1:51:15.725
Abandoning me?

1:51:19.485 --> 1:51:20.805
Was it worth it?

1:52:19.685 --> 1:52:22.805
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE
WAS LEGALIZED IN SPAIN IN 2005.

1:52:22.885 --> 1:52:25.845
TODAY, IT IS LEGAL IN ONLY 25 COUNTRIES
ACROSS THE WORLD.

1:52:25.925 --> 1:52:28.085
IN 72 COUNTRIES,
HOMOSEXUALITY IS CRIMINALIZED:

1:52:28.165 --> 1:52:31.045
IN 14 OF THEM, IT IS PUNISHED
WITH 14 YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON.

1:52:31.125 --> 1:52:35.445
IN 13 OF THEM, WITH THE DEATH PENALTY.

1:52:35.525 --> 1:52:42.525
ELISA AND MARCELA'S MARRIAGE
WAS NEVER ANNULLED.
