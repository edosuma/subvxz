WEBVTT

00:59.664 --> 01:00.966
<i>Alright, everyone,
we're gonna</i>

01:01.066 --> 01:02.888
<i>increase the resistance
by five</i>

01:02.988 --> 01:04.369
<i>between 30 and 40...</i>

01:27.213 --> 01:29.215
Aww.

01:40.627 --> 01:43.210
<i>Nice, everyone, great work.
Keep it up!</i>

02:02.170 --> 02:04.172
Aww.

02:10.339 --> 02:11.881
<i>Let's stay motivated, folks.</i>

02:11.981 --> 02:14.323
<i>Forward, forward, forward.</i>

02:27.878 --> 02:29.880
Aww.

03:30.784 --> 03:32.786
Fuck. Fuck.

03:43.318 --> 03:45.941
<i>That's right, Bobby.
Heavy snow is on the way</i>

03:46.041 --> 03:48.183
<i>if it's not already here.</i>

03:48.283 --> 03:49.745
<i>And with a winter
weather advisory</i>

03:49.845 --> 03:51.426
<i>now in place
across the state,</i>

03:51.526 --> 03:54.029
<i>we are asking that
if you can stay inside</i>

03:54.129 --> 03:55.911
<i>this evening,
please do so</i>

03:56.011 --> 03:57.873
<i>because we're expecting
most mountain passes</i>

03:57.973 --> 03:59.475
<i>to be snowed in.</i>

03:59.575 --> 04:02.078
<i>This storm has already
crippled Denver</i>

04:02.178 --> 04:03.799
<i>with road closures
and blackouts</i>

04:03.899 --> 04:05.721
<i>throughout the metro area.</i>

04:05.821 --> 04:07.764
<i>Several feet of snow
are expected tonight</i>

04:07.864 --> 04:10.527
<i>as this front moves
from west to east.</i>

04:10.627 --> 04:12.649
<i>Well, luckily, the
storm system should break</i>

04:12.749 --> 04:14.811
<i>before tomorrow morning's
commute begins.</i>

04:14.911 --> 04:17.013
<i>But we are keeping
our eye on the radar,</i>

04:17.113 --> 04:19.256
<i>and we will continue
to update you</i>

04:19.356 --> 04:20.337
<i>with further developments.</i>

04:26.523 --> 04:28.105
Officer Buckley, I was
just about to call you.

04:28.205 --> 04:29.827
Officer Buckley:
<i>Yeah, sure you were, Nelson.</i>

04:29.927 --> 04:31.629
<i>So the storm took down
our monitoring system.</i>

04:31.729 --> 04:33.711
<i>Your device will be out
through the night,</i>

04:33.811 --> 04:35.673
<i>but conditions
on your parole still apply.</i>

04:35.773 --> 04:37.075
<i>Do I need to remind you
of the consequences</i>

04:37.175 --> 04:38.116
<i>if I don't hear from you?</i>

04:38.216 --> 04:39.918
No, sir. I understand.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.720
Officer Buckley: <i>Good.
I'm coming to check on you</i>

04:41.820 --> 04:43.161
<i>at 7:00 a.m. when
the system's back online.</i>

04:43.261 --> 04:44.723
<i>You got that?</i>

04:44.823 --> 04:46.725
Got it.
Officer Buckley:
<i>Alright, Trey.</i>

04:46.825 --> 04:48.827
<i>Don't do anything
fuckin' stupid.</i>

05:18.218 --> 05:20.220
Fuck. Yes!

05:32.113 --> 05:32.974
Ahhh!

05:47.770 --> 05:48.711
Fuck.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.898
Jesus.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.675
Hey.

06:14.918 --> 06:16.921
Hey.

06:32.177 --> 06:34.179
Fuck.

07:24.632 --> 07:26.635
Hey, brother.

07:27.395 --> 07:29.397
How you doin', man?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.161
Cool, so listen...

08:01.071 --> 08:03.013
Hey, man.

08:03.113 --> 08:05.055
I am so sorry
about this.

08:05.155 --> 08:09.380
This whole thing
is fuckin' nightmare. I--

08:09.480 --> 08:11.182
Goddammit, it's good
to see your face, man.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.463
What's it been like,
a year?

08:12.563 --> 08:14.065
Y-years?

08:14.165 --> 08:16.167
What do you think's
going to happen here, Trey?

08:20.732 --> 08:22.734
I need to use the spot.

09:21.356 --> 09:23.358
Hey.

09:38.374 --> 09:41.558
Alright, uh,
I'm going to go.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.405
Look, man,
I am a piece of shit,

09:48.505 --> 09:51.488
and you are
a true friend, brother.

09:51.588 --> 09:53.851
But I, I do have to go.

09:53.951 --> 09:55.212
But I'm going to text you.

09:55.312 --> 09:57.314
We're going to talk
this all out.

10:01.279 --> 10:03.101
Okay.

10:03.201 --> 10:05.023
You know what?

10:05.123 --> 10:07.465
Let's,
let's talk it out now.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.907
Let's, let's go inside.
Let's get a drink.

10:09.007 --> 10:10.789
Everything's going
to be good. Okay?

10:10.889 --> 10:12.891
Okay.

10:15.534 --> 10:17.536
You still got my stash?

10:18.577 --> 10:20.579
Ahhh, yeah, you do.

10:23.062 --> 10:25.064
Place hasn't changed
a bit.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.027
Neither have you.

10:28.467 --> 10:29.889
Here you go, buddy.

10:29.989 --> 10:31.371
I don't know how you drink
that shit, man.

10:31.471 --> 10:33.613
It brings me back.

10:33.713 --> 10:35.715
To better times.

10:43.523 --> 10:45.385
I owe you a lot, brother.
I know that.

10:45.485 --> 10:47.668
And I am sorry
that I didn't call you

10:47.768 --> 10:48.989
as soon as I
got back into town.

10:49.089 --> 10:50.511
It's been
a fucked-up year.

10:50.611 --> 10:52.393
Can I show you something?

10:52.493 --> 10:54.495
Look at this shit.

10:56.457 --> 10:58.960
Some asshole at my firm
couldn't make his nut,

10:59.060 --> 11:00.521
he goes
all whistleblower,

11:00.621 --> 11:03.164
accuses everyone
of insider trading,

11:03.264 --> 11:04.446
some bullshit.

11:04.546 --> 11:06.848
They make me take
the fall.

11:06.948 --> 11:09.731
Now I'm six months
into a 14-month sentence,

11:09.831 --> 11:11.333
losing my fucking mind.

11:11.433 --> 11:13.335
Six months?

11:13.435 --> 11:14.496
You been back
for six months,

11:14.596 --> 11:16.598
and this is how
I hear from you.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.422
I was on house arrest.

11:19.522 --> 11:21.263
Yeah, you on
phone arrest too?

11:21.363 --> 11:23.986
Bro, I was embarrassed.

11:24.086 --> 11:26.469
Okay? The whole town
knows me as this big shot,

11:26.569 --> 11:28.431
and then I come back

11:28.531 --> 11:31.354
with a tag on my ankle
like some cow.

11:31.454 --> 11:33.637
Yeah, sure. It's humiliating
for you being back here, huh?

11:33.737 --> 11:35.739
I didn't say that.

11:37.220 --> 11:40.604
It's just you're
like family to me

11:40.704 --> 11:42.706
and I...

11:43.787 --> 11:45.789
I didn't want you to know.

11:48.392 --> 11:50.775
Anyway, looks like
you're doing great. Huh?

11:50.875 --> 11:52.096
Your pops left you
the place?

11:52.196 --> 11:54.819
Yeah. It's been
a real picnic.

11:54.919 --> 11:56.901
You got your family's money
and you go to Stanford,

11:57.001 --> 11:58.783
and I get stuck in this
fucking dump, you know.

11:58.883 --> 12:00.745
Fuck.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.048
You don't know what
this place was like
after all of it.

12:04.449 --> 12:06.451
You were gone.

12:08.694 --> 12:11.377
Everywhere I looked,
I saw her face.

12:16.742 --> 12:18.044
It's the power.

12:18.144 --> 12:20.146
It does this
during storms.

12:25.151 --> 12:27.013
Oh, you, you,
you want to go?

12:27.113 --> 12:29.115
Yeah, no,
you should fucking go.

12:31.037 --> 12:35.122
Look, there's nothing
I can say to help

12:36.083 --> 12:37.745
what happened.

12:37.845 --> 12:40.307
Maybe we just
shouldn't talk about it.

12:40.407 --> 12:42.790
Yeah, right.
I mean, you got
what you wanted. Yeah.

12:42.890 --> 12:45.112
I didn't say that.
I'm not a fuckin' idiot, Trey.

12:45.212 --> 12:47.315
I know I didn't go to college,
but I know what I'm here for.

12:47.415 --> 12:49.757
You know what? How about
I just give you some money.

12:49.857 --> 12:52.000
Man, it's the same damn thing
since we were kids.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.102
I don't need that shit.

12:55.623 --> 12:57.626
Okay.

12:58.587 --> 13:01.290
Fuck you too, then.

13:01.390 --> 13:05.014
And I went to Harvard.
Not fucking Stanford.

13:25.415 --> 13:27.417
The roads in
are shut down.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.502
Hold on. Hold on.

14:11.704 --> 14:13.706
Hey!

14:17.791 --> 14:19.793
Hey, she's hurt.
I think we need some help.

14:45.780 --> 14:48.363
Alright.
Looky here.

14:48.463 --> 14:50.465
More trees.

14:52.467 --> 14:54.169
Oh, hi.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.971
You know, there's probably
even more trees over that way

14:56.071 --> 14:59.455
at the scenic overlook
of trees.

14:59.555 --> 15:01.697
Enjoy.

15:01.797 --> 15:03.459
Anything I can
help you with?

15:03.559 --> 15:05.461
Oh, no, I'm good.
Just trying to get off

15:05.561 --> 15:07.904
these never-ending
mountains from hell.

15:08.004 --> 15:10.006
Why would you want to leave?
Hmm?

15:12.649 --> 15:13.990
Oh, hi.

15:14.090 --> 15:17.915
Uh, well,
that's a quality question.

15:18.015 --> 15:20.037
I guess I just don't
really go in for heights.

15:20.137 --> 15:23.200
It, uh, whacks out
my nasal passages.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.042
It's a real...

15:25.142 --> 15:27.805
You don't really need to know
all this, but it is a mess.

15:27.905 --> 15:29.907
Can I show you something?

15:31.068 --> 15:32.930
Well, I'd love to,
but I've got a very strict

15:33.030 --> 15:34.852
no second location policy.

15:34.952 --> 15:37.055
Served me well,
kept me from getting Zodiac'd.

15:37.155 --> 15:38.737
And I have been kind of

15:38.837 --> 15:40.699
a death magnet
this past year, so...

15:40.799 --> 15:42.100
No, no, but, uh...

15:42.200 --> 15:44.603
Well, we do all have
to go sometime.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.647
Let me just
fold up my map.

15:52.091 --> 15:54.994
Oh, great.
More trees. Terrific.

15:55.094 --> 15:56.155
You don't like trees?

15:56.255 --> 15:57.757
Pine trees, nah.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.799
You know what it is?
I smell pine and, boom,

15:59.899 --> 16:01.561
shitty Christmas memories.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.523
Proustian.
Yeah.

16:03.623 --> 16:05.625
Yeah, right. Proustian.

16:10.150 --> 16:12.152
Check it out!

16:12.753 --> 16:14.755
I call it
the Magic Mountain.

16:15.836 --> 16:17.838
Isn't it awesome?

16:22.563 --> 16:24.565

Magic Mountain!

17:47.653 --> 17:48.955
No!

17:49.055 --> 17:51.037
Ma'am, please, no.
No, ma'am, it's--

17:51.137 --> 17:52.919
Please stop.
It's gratis.

17:53.019 --> 17:55.161
Tips not required
but always appreciated.

17:55.261 --> 17:56.843
Here. Please. Please.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.126
Oh.

17:59.226 --> 18:01.228
Thank you. Kind of.

18:02.709 --> 18:05.332
Hey, hey.
What did I tell you?

18:05.432 --> 18:06.694
You can't be here.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.055
You're freaking out
the customers.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.897
Stan, my man,
believe me, I am trying.

18:09.997 --> 18:11.779
Okay. Just a couple
more windshields,

18:11.879 --> 18:14.422
and I'll be able to get
the Cuda to Denver.

18:14.522 --> 18:16.704
Now you, you want me
in Denver.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.786
I know you do.
You want this for me.

18:18.886 --> 18:20.708
If you're not out
of here in 20 minutes,
I'm calling the cops.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.471
Ah, you're a prince
among men, Stan.

18:23.571 --> 18:24.993
You're a prince among--

18:26.735 --> 18:28.316
Ah.

18:28.416 --> 18:30.799
Dude, you fucking wiped.

18:30.899 --> 18:33.882
Huh?
You fucking wiped.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.165
Yeah. Yeah, I sure did.

18:36.265 --> 18:37.847
Oh. God.

18:37.947 --> 18:39.528
Are you okay?
Oof.

18:39.628 --> 18:41.490
You need anything?
I got some Advil or Aleve,

18:41.590 --> 18:43.292
maybe a lidocaine patch
or codeine,

18:43.392 --> 18:44.734
Percocet, Peyote.

18:44.834 --> 18:45.895
You want coke?
I can get us some coke.

18:45.995 --> 18:47.617
Okay, easy, hacky sack.

18:47.717 --> 18:51.221
Uh, all I want is to get off
this shit mountain.

18:51.321 --> 18:52.302
You got a car?

18:52.402 --> 18:54.404
Uh, thatta way.

18:55.445 --> 18:58.428
It's nice!
Yeah. It's empty.

18:58.528 --> 18:59.790
Where are you headed?

18:59.890 --> 19:01.892
Sea level.

19:02.252 --> 19:03.474
Love that for you.

19:05.336 --> 19:09.520
So... if I fill you up,
will you give me a ride?

19:09.620 --> 19:11.362
For real? Alright.

19:11.462 --> 19:14.585
Uh, hey, I am just going
to need my wallet back.

19:24.035 --> 19:26.058
You're hilarious.

19:26.158 --> 19:27.539
Ah!

19:27.639 --> 19:29.641
Come on.

19:30.122 --> 19:32.705
Stan, my man.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.308
I am here
as a bona fide customer.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.410
I'm going to need a fill-up
on number seven.

19:40.093 --> 19:41.995
I've been seeing
these everywhere.

19:42.095 --> 19:43.797
They ever find this girl?
No.

19:43.897 --> 19:46.860
That thing's been hanging
there for ten years, so no.

19:50.824 --> 19:52.486
Family name.

19:52.586 --> 19:54.588
If I run this card,

19:54.948 --> 19:57.051
you're taking her with you.

19:57.151 --> 19:59.153
Oh, you will never
see us again.

20:01.395 --> 20:03.437
Have a safe trip,
Mr. Bernstein.

20:10.525 --> 20:12.147
So, Mortimer...

20:12.247 --> 20:14.469
what brought you
to Shit Mountain?

20:14.569 --> 20:17.713
I board.
So I follow the snow.

20:17.813 --> 20:19.815
But that life
is not cheap.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.177
So...

20:22.618 --> 20:24.640
So kind of a gentleman
thief situation.

20:24.740 --> 20:25.841
Alright.

20:25.941 --> 20:27.643
Well, I'm similarly nomadic

20:27.743 --> 20:29.365
minus the kleptomania.

20:29.465 --> 20:32.008
But maybe I should try it.
You could give me lessons.

20:32.108 --> 20:34.350
Sorry. I don't do sex stuff.

20:36.392 --> 20:38.394
No judgment, though.

20:42.319 --> 20:45.582
Man, it is really
fuckin' dumping, huh?

20:45.682 --> 20:47.784
Wonder if we should put on
the chains or something.

20:47.884 --> 20:49.226
Nah.

20:49.326 --> 20:51.468
Chains are a myth
by big automotive.

20:51.568 --> 20:53.510
If you start to skid,
just turn into the--

20:53.610 --> 20:55.232
Deer!

21:02.300 --> 21:03.962
You got to be kidding me.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.763
You were supposed
to turn into the--

21:05.863 --> 21:07.565
Alright, Morty, come on.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.535
Ahhh!

21:20.759 --> 21:22.541
Shit.

21:22.641 --> 21:24.904
Shit, shit, Shit Mountain.

21:25.004 --> 21:26.025
You have a phone?
What? No.

21:26.125 --> 21:27.547
I'm, I'm off the grid.

21:27.647 --> 21:29.148
Okay, I have one, but it's dead.

21:29.248 --> 21:31.250
So if you don't have
a charger in here, then...

21:34.013 --> 21:36.076
Hey, you know what?

21:36.176 --> 21:37.677
Why don't I stay in the car?

21:37.777 --> 21:39.719
You can walk back,
find that gas station dude.

21:39.819 --> 21:41.401
I know they had a tow truck.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.644
Oh. Great idea, Mortimer.

21:43.744 --> 21:46.286
Yes, that is a great idea.

21:46.386 --> 21:47.488
I am definitely going
to do that.

21:47.588 --> 21:48.609
Just riddle me this, Morty.

21:48.709 --> 21:50.711
Are you going to steal my car?

21:51.872 --> 21:53.374
No.
Bullshit.

21:53.474 --> 21:56.137
You are 100 percent
going to steal my car.

21:56.237 --> 21:58.099
Okay, fine!

21:58.199 --> 22:00.101
I'll walk back
and get us a tow.

22:00.201 --> 22:01.342
Okay?

22:01.442 --> 22:02.864
Geez.

22:02.964 --> 22:04.746
Mortimer.
What?

22:04.846 --> 22:06.848
Wallet.

22:11.613 --> 22:13.615
Klepto freak.

22:14.897 --> 22:15.958
Morty.

22:16.058 --> 22:18.060
Be careful.

22:30.794 --> 22:33.516
Alright, Morty,
where did you go?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.002
Fuck.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.432
Hey!

23:25.532 --> 23:27.914
Hey, over here. Help!

23:28.014 --> 23:29.476
Oh, my God.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.438
This asshole's really
not going to stop.

24:08.657 --> 24:10.780
Ah!

25:02.074 --> 25:03.456
Hold on.

25:03.556 --> 25:06.118
Down, down, down.

25:13.766 --> 25:15.929
Hey, she's hurt.
I think we need some help.

25:20.574 --> 25:22.576
Hey.

25:23.216 --> 25:25.219
Are you me?

25:52.688 --> 25:54.690
Hey.
Try to stay awake.

25:57.293 --> 25:59.915
Did I just die
on Shit Mountain?

26:00.015 --> 26:02.438
You're at a motel.
We found you by the door.

26:02.538 --> 26:04.540
Do you know what happened?

26:06.502 --> 26:08.044
I'm dead.

26:08.144 --> 26:10.607
I died on Shit Mountain.

26:10.707 --> 26:12.449
I've always been
the caretaker.

26:12.549 --> 26:14.010
What? Uh, no,
you're not dead.

26:14.110 --> 26:16.773
Do you know
what happened?

26:21.118 --> 26:22.700
Hello.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.802
Little twiggy friend.

26:25.362 --> 26:26.504
Where did you come from?

26:26.604 --> 26:28.786
Hey, can you focus?

26:28.886 --> 26:30.888
Can you focus
on me right now?

26:31.449 --> 26:33.351
Mr. Serious Focus Man.

26:33.451 --> 26:34.953
That's me. Yes. Hello.

26:35.053 --> 26:36.234
Listen, you've been
very badly hurt,

26:36.334 --> 26:37.756
but you're safe.

26:37.856 --> 26:39.798
We're trying to figure out
what happened.

26:39.898 --> 26:41.279
What do you remember?
Yeah.

26:41.379 --> 26:44.943
Uh, you see?
Uh, okay, uh...

26:48.147 --> 26:50.149
There was moose.

26:51.470 --> 26:53.472
Moose?
Moose.

26:53.833 --> 26:55.735
Communicating.

26:55.835 --> 26:57.336
And I thought,

26:57.436 --> 26:58.658
is he warning me?

26:58.758 --> 27:02.182
Some kind of
a moose warning?

27:02.282 --> 27:04.904
That's crazy, though.
But he was.

27:05.004 --> 27:06.826
So you think you
were attacked by a moose?

27:06.926 --> 27:08.789
No, no, no.
That's a stag.

27:08.889 --> 27:10.891
Hey, what's your name?

27:11.531 --> 27:13.533
Charlie. Uh...

27:14.615 --> 27:17.478
So sorry,
um, where am I.

27:17.578 --> 27:20.040
You're at a motel.
We found you outside.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.322
Yeah.

27:21.422 --> 27:23.424
Uh-huh.

27:24.305 --> 27:26.888
Ah! Ah!

27:26.988 --> 27:28.810
Oh, fuck!

27:28.910 --> 27:30.251
My leg!

27:30.351 --> 27:32.454
Jesus. Oh, my God,
my everything.

27:32.554 --> 27:33.695
Do you know
what happened to you?

27:33.795 --> 27:35.797
Yeah. Uh...

27:36.438 --> 27:38.140
I was, uh...

27:38.240 --> 27:39.221
Come on, think hard.

27:39.321 --> 27:40.742
Don't press her, dude.

27:40.842 --> 27:42.384
Okay.
No, it's, it's okay.

27:42.484 --> 27:44.606
Uh... so...

27:46.849 --> 27:48.230
I was on the road,

27:48.330 --> 27:51.133
and you were there.

27:52.855 --> 27:56.159
You know,
a mini you, uh, and...

27:56.259 --> 27:58.401
there were headlights
and they were,

27:58.501 --> 28:00.924
they were coming
right at me.

28:01.024 --> 28:03.326
And do you remember
what kind of car it was?

28:03.426 --> 28:05.969
I, I, I don't remember.
Just, just lights.

28:06.069 --> 28:09.373
And then, oh, my entire body
exploded in pain,

28:09.473 --> 28:11.335
and I saw a bunch of stars.

28:11.435 --> 28:14.118
And just as I was headed
for the light...

28:15.279 --> 28:17.281
I was a kid again.

28:17.802 --> 28:21.346
Back at Anaheim Shores
Beach Club.

28:21.446 --> 28:25.190
Uh, my family went there
one summer when I was eight.

28:25.290 --> 28:27.072
Oh, I hated that place.

28:27.172 --> 28:30.755
But in my dying moment,
that is where I went.

28:30.855 --> 28:33.759
Which is, oh,
it's very confusing for me.

28:33.859 --> 28:35.861
Because what if...

28:37.823 --> 28:39.825
Oh, God.

28:41.827 --> 28:43.569
What if that was

28:43.669 --> 28:45.371
the happiest moment
of my life?

28:45.471 --> 28:48.534
So you don't remember
anything real?

28:48.634 --> 28:50.536
Uh...

28:50.636 --> 28:52.378
my mom,

28:52.478 --> 28:56.863
she put me
in a Smurfette monokini.

28:56.963 --> 28:59.546
Why would she do that?
And, uh...

28:59.646 --> 29:03.510
Wait a minute, uh, uh,
who are you guys?

29:03.610 --> 29:05.192
Jimmy. We're friends. Trey.

29:05.292 --> 29:06.233
So, what happened next?

29:06.333 --> 29:08.355
Yeah. Then I...

29:08.455 --> 29:10.678
I woke up in a tree,

29:10.778 --> 29:12.520
'cause God knows
you've got nothing

29:12.620 --> 29:13.801
but trees around here.

29:13.901 --> 29:16.564
And then I...

29:16.664 --> 29:18.927
I slashed my way out
with my stabby stick.

29:20.388 --> 29:22.130
Okay, I'm at,
like, seven percent.

29:22.230 --> 29:23.451
But there's no hotspot,

29:23.551 --> 29:25.554
no Wi-Fi, no nothing.

29:26.314 --> 29:28.937
Dude.
What happened to you?

29:29.037 --> 29:31.860
Mortimer Bernstein,
you son of a bitch.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.002
We'll let you two
catch up.

29:37.206 --> 29:38.307
I almost had a heart attack--

29:38.407 --> 29:40.029
Just relax. Okay?

29:40.129 --> 29:42.311
I mean, she's alive, right?
So that's good news.

29:42.411 --> 29:45.435
The only good news is she's
got a classic case of CRS.

29:45.535 --> 29:46.716
Can't Remember Shit.

29:46.816 --> 29:48.238
With any luck,
she's fucking concussed.

29:48.338 --> 29:49.839
Permanent brain damage.
Don't say that.

29:49.939 --> 29:51.061
What, you want to start
answering questions

29:51.061 --> 29:52.963
about what went down?

29:53.063 --> 29:54.524
Alright, look,
the roads are closed.

29:54.624 --> 29:56.366
They're not going
anywhere tonight, okay.

29:56.466 --> 29:58.048
We'll get 'em a room. We'll
keep 'em here till morning.

29:58.148 --> 29:59.770
We? No, I can't do anything.
I got to go home.

29:59.870 --> 30:01.652
No, no, no.
You're not bailing on me--

30:01.752 --> 30:03.454
Do you know what happens if
I get caught outside my house?

30:03.554 --> 30:05.776
I don't give a shit. Okay.
What if they call the cops?

30:05.876 --> 30:08.499
Then we've got police
crawling all over.

30:08.599 --> 30:09.540
And what if they find
the spot?

30:09.640 --> 30:12.023
They can find the spot.

30:12.123 --> 30:13.144
That's why it's the spot.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.246
But what if.
Shut the fuck up.

30:17.689 --> 30:19.631
You wanna call the cops?

30:19.731 --> 30:20.672
Let's call the cops.

30:20.772 --> 30:22.774
Phone lines are down.

30:24.896 --> 30:26.899
Hey!

30:29.662 --> 30:31.323
Hey, we're having
an emergency

30:31.423 --> 30:33.045
down at the Deerfield Motel.

30:33.145 --> 30:34.607
Can you please put me
through to the police station?

30:34.707 --> 30:36.329
No. No cops. No cops.

30:36.429 --> 30:38.010
Uh...

30:38.110 --> 30:39.532
just with the storm,
they're probably so busy

30:39.632 --> 30:41.815
with the snow plows
and the snow things.

30:41.915 --> 30:43.857
Yeah, you're probably right.

30:43.957 --> 30:45.098
I don't think they could
even get through

30:45.198 --> 30:46.179
with the roads closed.

30:46.279 --> 30:47.541
Yeah, I saw a bunch of guys

30:47.641 --> 30:48.562
shutting down
the road to Denver.

30:48.562 --> 30:50.103
It is bad.

30:50.203 --> 30:52.626
Why were you driving
my car to Denver?

30:52.726 --> 30:54.728
To look for you.

30:55.329 --> 30:56.310
Silly.

30:56.410 --> 30:57.952
You stole my car?

30:58.052 --> 31:00.394
Man, you fucking
klepto hippie freak.

31:00.494 --> 31:02.316
Okay, you don't need
to get weird about it.

31:02.416 --> 31:04.398
Morty, look me in the eyes.

31:04.498 --> 31:07.081
Did you or any
of your associates run me over

31:07.181 --> 31:09.183
so you could steal my car?

31:10.144 --> 31:12.147
No.

31:13.588 --> 31:15.590
Alright.

31:16.351 --> 31:18.353
Oh, man. Wallet.

31:19.314 --> 31:23.138
Ladies, the closest clinic
is in Avon over the pass.

31:23.238 --> 31:24.860
I think it's too dangerous
to get you there tonight.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.862
So how about this?
Jimmy sets you up with a room.

31:26.962 --> 31:28.904
You clean up that leg,
get some rest.

31:29.004 --> 31:30.106
Gratis?

31:30.206 --> 31:31.707
Gratis.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.069
Yeah. Let's figure this
all out in the morning

31:33.169 --> 31:35.772
Can you walk?
Uh, yeah, probably.

31:38.214 --> 31:39.596
Bea Arthur,
that fucking hurts.

31:39.696 --> 31:41.318
Wait, wait,
I can make a splint.

31:41.418 --> 31:42.559
I do this all the time.

31:42.659 --> 31:43.680
I just need a stick

31:43.780 --> 31:46.203
and make it half
the size--

31:46.303 --> 31:48.005
No, no, that's an antique.

31:48.105 --> 31:49.606
I'll buy you
another antique.

31:49.706 --> 31:51.729
Uh, guys, be cool.
We can just use my stabby stick.

31:51.829 --> 31:52.810
Where is it?
It's, uh,

31:52.910 --> 31:53.891
it's actually exactly

31:53.991 --> 31:56.053
the perfect size, so...

31:59.116 --> 32:01.119
Mortimer!
Fuck in the fuck?

32:01.879 --> 32:03.881
That is not a stick.

32:13.091 --> 32:14.713
Yeah, that's a bone.

32:14.813 --> 32:16.395
Where'd you get
that thing?

32:16.495 --> 32:18.277
I don't know, the, uh,
the place I woke up,

32:18.377 --> 32:20.199
in the tree thing
out in the woods.

32:20.299 --> 32:22.962
You know, there's animal bones
everywhere out there.

32:23.062 --> 32:24.764
No way, dude.

32:24.864 --> 32:26.646
That is a person bone.

32:26.746 --> 32:28.968
Congratulations.
Because I think
you found a fossil.

32:29.068 --> 32:30.209
That's like Paleolithic
or something.

32:30.309 --> 32:31.371
From a caveman?

32:31.471 --> 32:32.412
Could be.

32:32.512 --> 32:34.174
No, that bone's not old.

32:34.274 --> 32:35.615
It's got metal pins in it.

32:35.715 --> 32:38.138
So that's surgical, right?

32:38.238 --> 32:40.500
Whoa! I know
what this is.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.783
What? We're all suddenly
bone-ologists here?

32:42.883 --> 32:45.225
My bud Turbo had
a gnarly half-pipe crash,

32:45.325 --> 32:46.987
and they did surgery
and put pins in his legs.

32:47.087 --> 32:49.690
And he showed me the x-rays,
and they looked just...

32:51.051 --> 32:52.793
like that.

32:52.893 --> 32:56.798
Morty, uh,
you and me, at Stan's,

32:56.898 --> 32:59.240
that sign with the snowboarding
girl who went missing,

32:59.340 --> 33:00.642
the one you see
all over town, right?

33:00.742 --> 33:02.203
This does sound familiar.

33:02.303 --> 33:03.445
Well, yes,
because you were there.

33:03.545 --> 33:04.846
Come on,
bus stops, Burger Kings,

33:04.946 --> 33:06.248
everywhere you go,
you see that,

33:06.348 --> 33:07.929
that flier
with their face on it.

33:08.029 --> 33:10.292
Uh, you guys know what
I'm talking about, right?

33:10.392 --> 33:14.016
She's got a catchy name.
Like Jackie Jazz or Claudia.

33:14.116 --> 33:17.179
Oh, the,
the hotel must have

33:17.279 --> 33:20.102
one of those
missing posters, right?

33:20.202 --> 33:22.585
No.
Bullshit.

33:22.685 --> 33:24.827
Why would you lie
about that?

33:24.927 --> 33:26.930
I know exactly why.

33:27.770 --> 33:32.235
Because there was
a reward, $75,000.

33:32.335 --> 33:33.717
See, I do remember.

33:33.817 --> 33:35.279
That's very sharp
of you, Morty.

33:35.379 --> 33:37.561
And Jimbo here is lying
because he wants

33:37.661 --> 33:39.803
the reward all to himself.

33:39.903 --> 33:41.245
What the fuck, dude?

33:41.345 --> 33:43.347
Jesus. Yes, I have one.

33:51.355 --> 33:54.899
Hey, look, Morty, are you
thinking what I'm thinking?

33:54.999 --> 33:57.302
75K.
We found Chloe Jones.

33:57.402 --> 34:00.065
Hey, the chances
that it's this girl,

34:00.165 --> 34:01.907
I mean, what are we
even talking about here?

34:02.007 --> 34:05.150
And we still can't do anything
about it until tomorrow morning.

34:05.250 --> 34:08.354
Jimmy, get the rooms ready.
The motel's empty.

34:08.454 --> 34:10.476
We're going to give you
the best rooms in the place.

34:10.576 --> 34:13.219
They're exactly the same
as all the other rooms.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.822
Jimmy.

34:17.583 --> 34:19.585
Come on.

34:30.677 --> 34:33.060
Morty.
Hang on a sec.

34:33.160 --> 34:37.064
Morty, w-would you stop stealing
for one second and listen to me?

34:37.164 --> 34:40.388
What?
Well, you're a woman
of the world.

34:40.488 --> 34:42.710
I mean, I can't be
the only one getting bad mojo

34:42.810 --> 34:44.792
around here, right?

34:44.892 --> 34:46.514
Now, these guys want
to put us in a room.

34:46.614 --> 34:48.396
Well, that is
a second location, my friend.

34:48.496 --> 34:50.118
So?
I've got a very strict

34:50.218 --> 34:52.040
never let dudes take you
to a second location policy.

34:52.140 --> 34:53.161
Served me quite well.

34:53.261 --> 34:54.643
I don't know.

34:54.743 --> 34:55.704
I'm pretty sure
the whole motel counts

34:55.704 --> 34:57.846
as one location.

34:57.946 --> 35:00.649
Besides, the angry one
in the sweatsuit's kind of hot.

35:00.749 --> 35:03.652
Okay, well, he's,
he's wearing an ankle monitor,

35:03.752 --> 35:05.895
so that's kind of
a major red flag.

35:05.995 --> 35:08.137
Oh, yeah? Ooh.

35:08.237 --> 35:09.859
Morty.

35:09.959 --> 35:11.541
I'm just saying, those things
are mostly for rich guys

35:11.641 --> 35:14.744
that have lawyers
and do, like, light crimes.

35:14.844 --> 35:17.026
Light crimes.
Oh, very good. Okay.

35:17.126 --> 35:19.349
You guys make a terrific couple.
I'll see you at the wedding, Gatsby.

35:19.449 --> 35:21.071
Hot or not, there's no way
we're sharing

35:21.171 --> 35:23.113
that reward money
with those brodinskis.

35:23.213 --> 35:25.035
We wouldn't even know
it was a bone

35:25.135 --> 35:26.677
if it weren't for me.

35:26.777 --> 35:28.839
Ah, yes. Your contributions
have been manifold.

35:28.939 --> 35:30.000
And you are the one
who found it

35:30.100 --> 35:31.081
because you were
left for dead.

35:31.181 --> 35:32.683
That's not nothing.

35:32.783 --> 35:34.845
No, you're right.
That's not nothing.

35:34.945 --> 35:36.247
In fact, it's odd, huh?

35:36.347 --> 35:38.009
What?
Well,

35:38.109 --> 35:39.731
what are the chances
of me almost dying

35:39.831 --> 35:41.693
and then getting dumped
right next to another body?

35:41.793 --> 35:44.175
Statistically?
No, wait.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.817
I wasn't dumped.

35:45.917 --> 35:48.740
That weird tree thing that
I woke up in, it's hard to find.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.902
You'd have to know
it was there.

35:51.002 --> 35:53.185
So that means...

35:53.285 --> 35:56.148
whoever hit me in the road
and stuck me there,

35:56.248 --> 35:59.191
they also maybe buried
Chloe Jones.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.554
Yeah, I figured that out
ten minutes ago.

36:01.654 --> 36:05.398
But the thing with
a hit-and-run
is they probably ran.

36:05.498 --> 36:06.839
Ran where?
The roads are closed.

36:06.939 --> 36:08.941
There is nowhere to run.
Give me the phone.

36:12.185 --> 36:14.808
Only if you promise
we split the reward.

36:14.908 --> 36:17.150
Yeah, y-y-you win.
Give me the phone.

36:18.672 --> 36:20.213
Look, I'm calling this in
under your name,

36:20.313 --> 36:22.316
you know, assuming
that you have one.

36:22.876 --> 36:24.538
Holy shit.
This line is dead.

36:24.638 --> 36:26.640
I don't think these guys
called the cops.

36:28.242 --> 36:30.464
Why would they do that?
Oh, I don't know,

36:30.564 --> 36:32.346
but I'm not really in
a speculating mood right now.

36:32.446 --> 36:33.948
We need to go.
I am not going anywhere

36:34.048 --> 36:35.269
without getting
that reward.

36:35.369 --> 36:37.372
Morty, we need to go now!

36:39.534 --> 36:41.536
Fine.

36:42.497 --> 36:45.160
But you're really messed up,
and I can't carry you.

36:45.260 --> 36:47.763
You need, like,
gauze and meds.

36:47.863 --> 36:49.364
Maybe there's some
first aid shit in your trunk.

36:49.464 --> 36:50.726
Wait, why were you going
through my trunk?

36:50.826 --> 36:52.828
I'll be right back.
Bullshit, Morty.

36:54.710 --> 36:56.712
God damn you, Bernstein.

37:00.636 --> 37:02.018
What are
the fucking odds, man?

37:02.118 --> 37:03.299
I'm not even
supposed to be here.

37:03.399 --> 37:04.741
Yeah, well, you called me.

37:04.841 --> 37:06.102
Now they're going
to call the cops

37:06.202 --> 37:07.904
for some pissant reward?

37:08.004 --> 37:09.746
You know,
for most people, Trey,

37:09.846 --> 37:11.868
75 grand is real money.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.670
Okay, working-class hero,

37:13.770 --> 37:15.192
I get it,
it's real money for them.

37:15.292 --> 37:17.114
Then why don't you open
your wallet, huh?

37:17.214 --> 37:19.476
Double the reward
if they keep their mouth shut.

37:19.576 --> 37:21.198
Pay 'em off.
That's what you do, right?

37:21.298 --> 37:23.300
My God, it's not like
you didn't take the money!

37:25.342 --> 37:27.044
Because you did,
didn't you?

37:27.144 --> 37:28.846
Now you're trying
to play all wounded

37:28.946 --> 37:31.429
and throw that back
in my face ten years later.

37:33.031 --> 37:36.174
Look, we just need to get
through the night, okay.

37:36.274 --> 37:38.256
They'll leave. You heard them.
They don't want fucking cops.

37:38.356 --> 37:41.019
Those chicks are shady
as hell.

37:41.119 --> 37:43.101
Yeah, well, you know what?
Maybe that works in our favour.

37:43.201 --> 37:45.204
I'm saying
they're unpredictable.

37:50.249 --> 37:52.251
Maybe we just
take care of them.

37:54.974 --> 37:56.976
Don't make me ask
what the fuck that means.

37:57.897 --> 37:59.279
They can be handled.

37:59.379 --> 38:00.680
If you're worried
they're going to bolt,

38:00.780 --> 38:02.001
I've got some blues
I can slip 'em, alright?

38:02.101 --> 38:03.443
Give 'em
a good night's sleep

38:03.543 --> 38:06.206
and then pay 'em.

38:06.306 --> 38:08.088
And they're gone.

38:08.188 --> 38:09.930
Okay.

38:10.030 --> 38:11.251
But you better be right.

38:11.351 --> 38:12.573
Last thing I need
is another chick

38:12.673 --> 38:14.675
going crazy on me
right now.

38:17.998 --> 38:20.061
What the fuck? What?

38:20.161 --> 38:22.143
They can be handled?

38:22.243 --> 38:24.245
Great instincts, bro.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.953
Oh, shit.

38:57.921 --> 38:59.923
Chloe.

39:02.005 --> 39:04.007
Ka-ching.

39:04.488 --> 39:06.470
Oh.

39:18.262 --> 39:20.264
You lose this?

39:21.065 --> 39:23.488
I was just coming
to check on you but...

39:23.588 --> 39:25.490
looks like you're taking
pretty good care of yourself.

39:25.590 --> 39:27.592
I always do.

39:28.954 --> 39:30.816
Why don't you, uh,
lower that gun

39:30.916 --> 39:31.817
before someone gets hurt?

39:31.917 --> 39:32.978
Hurt?

39:34.559 --> 39:37.362
Seems like that bird
has flown, Trey.

39:38.444 --> 39:39.905
That's a lot
of hurt in there.

39:40.005 --> 39:41.387
Look, I don't know
what you think's going on.

39:41.487 --> 39:43.509
I think I just caught
the psychopathic asshole

39:43.609 --> 39:45.952
who hit my friend in the road
and buried them in a tree.

39:46.052 --> 39:47.754
Calm down.
And was dumb enough to do it

39:47.854 --> 39:49.976
in the stupidest shoes
to wear in the snow.

39:51.257 --> 39:53.360
Ever.

39:53.460 --> 39:56.423
Yeah, you left
your dipshit footprints
at a crime scene.

39:58.104 --> 40:01.168
And it was
a gnarly crime scene.

40:01.268 --> 40:03.170
That's Chloe Jones
in there.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.452
So between this and the LoJack
on your ankle,

40:05.552 --> 40:09.637
I'm starting to think you've got
quite a lot to lose here, Trey.

40:10.958 --> 40:13.461
Tell me what you want.

40:13.561 --> 40:15.843
That was the first smart thing
you've said all night.

40:20.728 --> 40:22.731
Come on,
you little bastard.

40:28.737 --> 40:31.460
Augh. You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

40:32.101 --> 40:33.562
Okay.

40:33.662 --> 40:35.664
Aah!

40:45.475 --> 40:47.477
Jesus.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.571
Oh.
Where's your friend?

41:19.671 --> 41:21.673
Uh, she's getting something
from the car.

41:23.475 --> 41:25.477
Well, she forgot your keys.

41:26.118 --> 41:28.120
Yeah.

41:32.204 --> 41:34.206
So you knew Chloe Jones?

41:39.052 --> 41:40.994
So you're the guy.

41:41.094 --> 41:42.395
The guy?

41:42.495 --> 41:44.638
The guy who drops
300K on a car

41:44.738 --> 41:47.641
just to show the world
what a big dick he has.

41:47.741 --> 41:49.122
Guilty.

41:49.222 --> 41:50.384
Just so you understand
what you're getting here,

41:50.384 --> 41:51.845
this is
a Lamborghini Urus.

41:51.945 --> 41:54.368
Urus. Twin-turbo V-8,
graphite capsule,

41:54.468 --> 41:56.470
only a few hundred
in the US.

41:58.232 --> 42:00.274
I don't just steal wallets.

42:01.195 --> 42:03.057
I take pride in my work.

42:03.157 --> 42:05.980
Not that I've ever boosted
a ride as sweet as this one.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.742
Little better than
the junker out front, huh?

42:07.842 --> 42:09.844
Got that right.

42:10.565 --> 42:12.567
Damn.

42:13.128 --> 42:15.110
You really hit her.

42:15.210 --> 42:17.212
That going
to be a problem?

42:27.103 --> 42:29.105
Just cosmetic damage.

42:29.905 --> 42:32.008
You're an asshole.

42:32.108 --> 42:33.489
But you already knew that.

42:33.589 --> 42:36.092
Do we have a deal?
Yeah, we have a deal.

42:36.192 --> 42:37.654
But if you're thinking
about calling the cops

42:37.754 --> 42:39.816
as soon as I hit the road,

42:39.916 --> 42:41.258
don't forget that
I know all about

42:41.358 --> 42:43.360
your little hidey-hole.

42:44.241 --> 42:46.243
And I got a phone
full of photos.

42:47.084 --> 42:48.345
Yeah.

42:55.493 --> 42:57.495
Trey was the one
who was tight with Chloe.

43:00.017 --> 43:02.100
They had this on-again,
off-again thing.

43:03.661 --> 43:07.005
But... sometimes
we all hung out.

43:07.105 --> 43:08.366
Huh.

43:08.466 --> 43:11.049
It was fun
being around her.

43:11.149 --> 43:13.151
You know,
she had an energy.

43:15.594 --> 43:17.496
I miss her.

43:17.596 --> 43:20.059
I'm sorry. Uh...

43:20.159 --> 43:22.501
Yeah, it seems like
she was kind of a big deal

43:22.601 --> 43:24.423
with the snowboarding.

43:24.523 --> 43:26.786
Sort of a real
small-town hero, huh?

43:26.886 --> 43:29.008
Everyone thought she was going
to go to the Olympics.

43:31.010 --> 43:33.994
Then... she just vanished.

43:34.094 --> 43:36.716
People talked,
pressure got to her.

43:36.816 --> 43:39.259
Being the golden child,
she skipped town.

43:40.540 --> 43:42.543
There was a lot of talk.

43:46.947 --> 43:49.029
You're not looking so hot. Yeah...

43:52.033 --> 43:54.635
You should take these.
It's ibuprofen.

43:55.636 --> 43:57.639
I'd start with two.

43:58.319 --> 44:00.321
Yeah. Thanks.

44:01.723 --> 44:03.425
So you think
that's her out there?

44:03.525 --> 44:05.067
I don't want
to think about it.

44:05.167 --> 44:06.348
Right. I mean, I--

44:06.448 --> 44:08.190
Me, I just,
I can't get over

44:08.290 --> 44:10.552
the coincidence,
you know, uh--

44:10.652 --> 44:12.114
Like, do you think that
maybe the same guy--

44:12.214 --> 44:14.216
What did I just say?

44:15.457 --> 44:17.460
I can't think
about it, you know.

44:19.302 --> 44:21.304
It's too hard.

44:22.505 --> 44:24.607
You know, this isn't
a cold case mystery

44:24.707 --> 44:27.190
for me or some bullshit.

44:31.795 --> 44:34.558
It never fucking goes away.

44:38.962 --> 44:40.965
Does it ever go away?

44:44.288 --> 44:46.470
I wish I'd...

44:46.570 --> 44:49.093
I'd have
protected her from...

44:50.054 --> 44:52.056
whatever I...

44:52.977 --> 44:54.979
I wish I'd have been
strong like that.

44:56.461 --> 44:59.084
Man, I-I'm sorry.

44:59.184 --> 45:04.530
I, I just started snapping
into this mode I have and...

45:04.630 --> 45:06.972
You know, it's, it's been
pretty messed up here,

45:07.072 --> 45:08.173
to tell you the truth.

45:08.273 --> 45:10.276
I generally live
in the sunshine.

45:10.676 --> 45:12.578
But this year,

45:12.678 --> 45:16.743
I mean, it has
eroded me, you know.

45:16.843 --> 45:19.846
It's just... Jesus, like...

45:23.129 --> 45:26.132
It's been pretty dark,
actually, you know.

45:27.334 --> 45:29.816
It's hard
to feel safe and, uh...

45:32.019 --> 45:34.021
Anyway.

45:34.581 --> 45:36.664
Look, I-I'm sorry. I...

45:41.389 --> 45:43.511
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you tonight.

45:45.793 --> 45:47.936
You believe me, right?

45:48.036 --> 45:50.058
Yeah.

45:50.158 --> 45:52.160
Yeah, I do.

45:54.803 --> 45:57.105
Tell you what, Jimmy,
end of the day,

45:57.205 --> 45:58.947
all I really want to do

45:59.047 --> 46:01.049
is get off
this shit mountain.

46:08.057 --> 46:10.059
Anaheim Shores...

46:25.355 --> 46:27.217
Proustian.

46:27.317 --> 46:29.440
You okay?
What the hell is in this?

46:33.284 --> 46:35.506
Oh, shit.
Oh, that's Trey's coconut rum.

46:35.606 --> 46:38.289
He fucking loves that shit.
Sorry about that. Hold up.

46:41.853 --> 46:44.696
You know, I, uh,
I think I'm just going to...

46:45.857 --> 46:47.078
ow, find Morty

46:47.178 --> 46:49.981
and, uh, get,
get out of here.

46:56.949 --> 46:58.951
Strong...

47:00.673 --> 47:02.675
ibuprofen.

47:55.691 --> 47:57.693
Au revoir, Morty.

48:12.829 --> 48:14.911
Oh, Jesus Christ.

48:26.684 --> 48:28.686
Ibuprofen, my ass.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.235
What happened to the girl?
Don't worry about it.
We're good.

48:37.335 --> 48:38.917
No, dude.
You look like shit.

48:39.017 --> 48:41.720
Yeah, because I was busy
fixing our problem.

48:41.820 --> 48:43.362
Saving you again.
You're welcome.

48:43.462 --> 48:44.843
Trey,
what did you do to her?

48:44.943 --> 48:46.525
It's not going
to be a problem

48:46.625 --> 48:47.887
for us anymore, okay.

48:47.987 --> 48:49.889
Oh, fuck, Morty,
I'm sorry.

48:49.989 --> 48:53.372
Oh, my God.
No one is going
to miss this girl.

48:53.472 --> 48:54.894
Okay? Nobody.
We all could have--

48:54.994 --> 48:57.977
Fuck you, guys.
Fuck you.

48:58.077 --> 48:59.419
You took this
way too far, man.

48:59.519 --> 49:01.501
I caught her trying
to steal my car.

49:01.601 --> 49:03.063
Okay?
Bullshit.

49:03.163 --> 49:04.744
She was gonna
go to the cops.

49:04.844 --> 49:06.626
I did what I had to do
to save your sorry ass.

49:06.726 --> 49:07.868
To save me?
Yeah.

49:07.968 --> 49:09.389
I didn't want
any of this.

49:09.489 --> 49:10.410
Yeah, well,
I didn't want to crash

49:10.410 --> 49:11.792
my 300K car

49:11.892 --> 49:13.934
because some chick's
going crazy on me again.

49:15.816 --> 49:17.198
That's the second time
you say that tonight.

49:17.298 --> 49:19.120
Say what?

49:19.220 --> 49:22.003
Some other chick
going crazy on you.

49:22.103 --> 49:25.126
Are you--
Are you talking about Chloe?

49:25.226 --> 49:27.208
Fucking shit.
Are you serious?

49:27.308 --> 49:29.531
We're gonna talk
about this right now?
Was it, Trey? Trey.

49:29.631 --> 49:31.012
Here we go.
What did you do?

49:31.112 --> 49:32.494
Hold on. Do you hear that?
Shit.

49:32.594 --> 49:34.176
No. Don't change the--
Shut the fuck up. Listen.

49:35.717 --> 49:37.719
Gotcha.

49:38.840 --> 49:40.843
Ah!

49:47.089 --> 49:48.471
Oh.
Oh, shit.

49:48.571 --> 49:50.032
I thought
you were asleep.

49:50.132 --> 49:52.475
Uh, well, you also thought
I was dead, right?

49:52.575 --> 49:54.317
So I guess this is
a thing I do now.

49:54.417 --> 49:55.799
You should have stayed down. Trey.

49:55.899 --> 49:57.440
Man, you fucking
ran me over.

49:57.540 --> 49:59.843
Chill out.
Look, whatever he told you,

49:59.943 --> 50:01.204
he is lying, okay.

50:01.304 --> 50:02.966
He killed Chloe... Okay.

50:03.066 --> 50:04.888
...and now he's doing it again.
We need to get her outside.

50:04.988 --> 50:06.690
He's just going
to leave you here to do
his dirty work,

50:06.790 --> 50:08.212
and then he's going to bail.

50:08.312 --> 50:09.934
Just leave you in this
haunted moose lodge,

50:10.034 --> 50:11.175
seeing Chloe
everywhere you look.

50:11.275 --> 50:12.817
Are you trying to play us

50:12.917 --> 50:14.578
against each other?

50:14.678 --> 50:16.180
We've been friends
for years.

50:16.280 --> 50:17.702
Bullshit. Okay.

50:17.802 --> 50:20.265
Jimmy, he killed her.
You understand?

50:20.365 --> 50:22.747
He killed Chloe.
Oh, my God, you bitch!

50:22.847 --> 50:24.549
This is pathetic, right?

50:24.649 --> 50:26.591
Trey, what did you mean?

50:26.691 --> 50:28.353
What?

50:28.453 --> 50:30.435
"Another chick going crazy
on you." What did you mean?

50:30.535 --> 50:32.718
Don't let her get inside
your head right now, man.

50:32.818 --> 50:34.480
It's just, Chloe.

50:34.580 --> 50:36.201
Chloe.

50:36.301 --> 50:37.603
Did she go crazy on you?

50:37.703 --> 50:40.846
Dude--
You said she had an accident.

50:40.946 --> 50:43.970
A bad reaction to the coke
I sold you, that she fell.

50:44.070 --> 50:45.772
That is what happened.
She fell.

50:45.872 --> 50:47.133
No, that is bullshit.

50:47.233 --> 50:49.375
Did you hit her?

50:49.475 --> 50:51.257
Did you push her?
No!

50:51.357 --> 50:52.339
Bullshit!

50:52.439 --> 50:53.420
Okay, none of this matters!

50:53.520 --> 50:54.581
We were kids.

50:54.681 --> 50:56.683
I mean, who cares?

50:59.206 --> 51:02.950
Jimmy, how long have
we known each other?

51:03.050 --> 51:04.471
Think about everything
we've been through.

51:04.571 --> 51:07.995
Man, you were always
like my big brother.

51:08.095 --> 51:12.360
You're my protector.
And now I can return the favour.

51:12.460 --> 51:14.842
You want out of all this?
I can get you out.

51:14.942 --> 51:16.945
Jimmy--

51:17.946 --> 51:19.447
Whatever you want.

51:19.547 --> 51:21.630
We just got to do
this one last thing.

51:24.553 --> 51:26.555
Jimmy, please.

51:28.477 --> 51:29.578
Alright.

51:29.678 --> 51:31.580
There he is.

51:31.680 --> 51:33.682
Let's get her outside.
It's cleaner that way.

51:47.097 --> 51:49.099
No.

51:50.180 --> 51:51.802
Okay. Come on.
Let's just get--

51:51.902 --> 51:53.904
Back up, man.

52:00.391 --> 52:02.393
Get out of my way.

52:03.554 --> 52:06.177
You ruined my life.
I ruined your life?

52:06.277 --> 52:08.259
I was the only good thing
you had going.

52:08.359 --> 52:11.262
You were a loser then,
just like you're a loser now.

52:11.362 --> 52:13.545
Look at you, still stuck
in this shithole?

52:13.645 --> 52:15.347
Let me tell you a secret.

52:15.447 --> 52:18.490
This is where you were
always going to be.

52:19.611 --> 52:21.033
Maybe.

52:21.133 --> 52:24.076
But at least I'm done
being your bitch.

52:29.702 --> 52:31.704
Oh!

55:22.565 --> 55:24.948
That is how
you fuckin' do it!

55:25.048 --> 55:26.029
Woo!

55:27.570 --> 55:28.992
Officer Buckley:
<i>Morning, Trey,</i>

55:29.092 --> 55:30.113
<i>It's your friendly neighbourhood</i>

55:30.213 --> 55:31.475
<i>parole officer.</i>

55:31.575 --> 55:32.516
Be right there.

55:42.186 --> 55:44.248
Officer Buckley:
<i>Alright, man, hurry up.</i>

55:44.348 --> 55:45.449
<i>It's cold out here.</i>

56:55.143 --> 56:57.145
Merry Christmas.

56:58.467 --> 57:00.169
<i>This morning,
Colorado residents</i>

57:00.269 --> 57:01.490
<i>who were in
a decade-long search...</i>

57:01.590 --> 57:02.852
Ah.

57:02.952 --> 57:04.013
<i>...responding to a tip</i>

57:04.113 --> 57:04.854
<i>from a parole officer...</i>

57:04.954 --> 57:06.656
Robocop.

57:06.756 --> 57:08.538
<i>...on the property
of the Deerfield Motel.</i>

57:08.638 --> 57:11.100
<i>Authorities have confirmed
that the remains belong</i>

57:11.200 --> 57:13.343
<i>to long-missing
snowboarding phenom</i>

57:13.443 --> 57:15.185
<i>Chloe Jones.</i>

57:15.285 --> 57:17.948
<i>In a bizarre twist,
Jones was discovered alongside</i>

57:18.048 --> 57:20.030
<i>two more recent slayings.</i>

57:20.130 --> 57:22.953
<i>A local, James Silva,
was found dead</i>

57:23.053 --> 57:25.556
<i>along with a drifter
named Charlie Kale,</i>

57:25.656 --> 57:27.798
<i>whose body
and identification was found</i>

57:27.898 --> 57:29.960
<i>in a wrecked vehicle
near the property.</i>

57:30.060 --> 57:31.642
Mortimer?
<i>They're both believed</i>

57:31.742 --> 57:33.965
<i>to be victims
of a wealthy parolee,</i>

57:34.065 --> 57:34.966
<i>Trey Nelson.</i>

57:35.066 --> 57:36.127
<i>Stay tuned for more</i>

57:36.227 --> 57:38.289
<i>on this developing story.</i>

57:38.389 --> 57:39.971
<i>And now we turn
to county politics</i>

57:40.071 --> 57:42.534
<i>where a referendum
on snowmobiling has...</i>

57:42.634 --> 57:44.636
I'm dead.

57:45.637 --> 57:47.058
Holy God almighty.

57:47.158 --> 57:48.580
I'm dead.

58:05.938 --> 58:08.241
It's over. We got her.

58:08.341 --> 58:11.064
