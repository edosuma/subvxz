WEBVTT

00:04.655 --> 00:06.551
Franklin, it's me, Gwen.

00:07.206 --> 00:09.206
A scandal? You're not
taking advantage, are you?

00:09.344 --> 00:11.275
I take advantage
of everyone, Your Honor.

00:11.413 --> 00:13.344
I'm Vanessa Hastings, I'm new.

00:14.689 --> 00:16.137
I gotta share my office
with a rookie?

00:16.275 --> 00:17.827
- Miss Sullivan--
- This is a joke!

00:17.965 --> 00:20.068
And I expect it from a prick
like him but not from you!

00:20.206 --> 00:21.931
You are supposed to care.

00:22.068 --> 00:23.655
Miss Sullivan,
you are in contempt.

00:23.793 --> 00:25.034
What's wrong with passion?

00:26.758 --> 00:27.758
Here's to the win!

00:27.931 --> 00:30.000
Can't wait to do it again!

00:40.068 --> 00:41.551
- I've got trial.
- I'm in arraignments.

00:42.931 --> 00:44.241
Unknown number again?

00:44.379 --> 00:46.482
Must be Amex,
or Bloomingdales or ShopUp.

00:46.827 --> 00:48.241
Thank you, I'm just saying.

00:48.413 --> 00:50.413
I get buying
one purse, but eight?

00:50.551 --> 00:51.724
Free shipping.

00:52.103 --> 00:53.137
Ladies...

00:53.551 --> 00:55.931
Oh my Lord!
You slept with him last night!

00:56.068 --> 00:57.689
Jesus, he said one word.
How did you know?

00:57.827 --> 00:59.241
How did I not know?

00:59.379 --> 01:01.000
It's almost eight o'clock
you haven't sworn at anyone.

01:01.137 --> 01:04.172
You were playing happy
Mary J. Blige this morning--

01:04.310 --> 01:06.344
- It's a good day.
- And, you got that

01:06.482 --> 01:08.000
"I just got some" glow
on your face.

01:08.137 --> 01:10.551
- I was drunk.
- You weren't that drunk.

01:10.724 --> 01:12.413
God what is it with you two?

01:12.551 --> 01:14.000
I do not know
except for the sex

01:14.137 --> 01:16.000
which is mind bending...
But you know what?

01:16.137 --> 01:18.448
It doesn't matter he drives
me crazy, so I am done.

01:18.586 --> 01:21.172
I've moved on.
I even posted new Tinder pics.

01:21.310 --> 01:24.827
Oh please, watching you date
is like watching Goldilocks.

01:24.965 --> 01:26.482
He's taller
than my law professor.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.310
He's shorter
than my law professor.

01:28.448 --> 01:29.551
Bennet.

01:29.689 --> 01:31.310
Honey, I know
his name is Bennet.

01:31.448 --> 01:33.103
The point is you've gotta stop
comparing everyone to him.

01:33.241 --> 01:36.000
No. There. Bennet.

01:38.413 --> 01:40.206
That's the hot law professor?

01:40.896 --> 01:43.379
I would show up
for his office hours.

01:51.241 --> 01:53.103
I've been trying to catch up
with you for a minute.

01:53.241 --> 01:55.379
What? You're too important
to answer your phone now?

01:55.517 --> 01:58.034
Listen, in my world, no caller
ID is either a bill collector,

01:58.172 --> 01:59.827
my drunk mother
or somebody wanting to know

01:59.965 --> 02:01.931
why I couldn't get their kid
off on their robbery charge.

02:02.068 --> 02:03.517
My fault.

02:03.655 --> 02:05.310
Well my publicist thought
I should have a secure number--

02:05.448 --> 02:08.586
Your publicist? Look at you.
Somebody went and got brand new.

02:09.068 --> 02:10.172
How long you in town?

02:10.310 --> 02:11.655
Well I'm back now,
I bought a home.

02:11.793 --> 02:13.172
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

02:13.310 --> 02:14.931
Let me guess, within walking
distance of Red Rooster?

02:15.068 --> 02:16.517
A brownstone
up in Hamilton Heights.

02:16.655 --> 02:17.896
Like that!

02:18.034 --> 02:19.413
Okay, you've come a long way
from teaching me

02:19.551 --> 02:21.344
the difference between
battery and assault.

02:22.103 --> 02:24.068
Hello? Hey.

02:24.965 --> 02:26.172
Can I call you back?

02:26.965 --> 02:28.482
Okay. Bye.

02:29.655 --> 02:31.448
- Sorry. People waiting--
- No, that's okay.

02:31.586 --> 02:32.862
Listen, I'm running late,

02:33.206 --> 02:34.862
but there's something
I want to tell you.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.137
How about dinner?

02:36.379 --> 02:38.413
I'd love to, but I got
this 14 year-old kid

02:38.551 --> 02:41.137
who's being tried as an adult
on a murder charge today.

02:41.275 --> 02:43.206
Really love
you're still fighting power.

02:43.379 --> 02:44.896
That's me. Ever vigilant.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.310
But it's nothing
compared to you.

02:46.448 --> 02:48.034
I mean, you won
a national book award,

02:48.172 --> 02:49.689
you got a movie deal going,

02:49.827 --> 02:52.000
- you're just a celebrity--
- Hey, hey, hey stop it.

02:52.137 --> 02:54.586
You're a badass sister.
Own it, be proud.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.241
- Thank you.
- Come on. Dinner...

02:57.655 --> 02:58.965
a nice glass of red?

02:59.103 --> 03:01.103
Have I ever said no
to a nice glass of red?

03:01.689 --> 03:04.206
All right. Well, I'll call
you with the details.

03:04.689 --> 03:07.310
- Pick up your phone this time.
- I will pick up my phone.

03:33.137 --> 03:35.000
You thinking what I'm thinking?

03:36.413 --> 03:37.655
You have broad shoulders.

03:37.793 --> 03:39.241
That's not what
I'm thinking but yeah,

03:39.379 --> 03:41.034
- I'm wide. I do five sessions--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:41.172 --> 03:42.931
Take off your jacket
and your shirt.

03:43.413 --> 03:44.586
You want some more
of big Charlie.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.689
A little live fun?
You got it.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.551
Thanks. Now your pants.

03:48.793 --> 03:51.172
I like it when you
have in control like this.

03:53.413 --> 03:55.000
Watch me, yes.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
No. We're not
doing that anymore.

04:00.137 --> 04:01.724
- Wha--?
- I'm serious this time.

04:01.862 --> 04:03.137
- I mean it.
- You...

04:03.275 --> 04:04.655
meant it last time
and the time before that.

04:04.793 --> 04:05.862
Yeah. Thank you for these.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.206
Wait, wait what?

04:07.344 --> 04:10.034
Gwen. What?

04:10.172 --> 04:11.241
Have you seen Gwen?

04:11.517 --> 04:12.896
Just went that way, Tom.

04:13.034 --> 04:14.793
Vanessa will shadow you then.
Come in.

04:15.310 --> 04:17.965
Guide her through the wonderful
world of arraignments.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.862
Hi, is there anything
normal about this place?

04:23.275 --> 04:25.758
- It's Casual Thursday.
- Mm-hmm.

04:32.551 --> 04:35.724
Willy doesn't belong
in adult court, he's only 14.

04:35.862 --> 04:37.344
I know, but he did
shoot a veteran

04:37.482 --> 04:39.137
- and in the court--
- Can't you talk to the judge?

04:39.275 --> 04:41.103
She is sympathetic,
but the prosecutor

04:41.241 --> 04:43.310
has to consent to moving
the case to juvenile court

04:43.448 --> 04:45.620
and he never wants
to appear soft on crime.

04:45.793 --> 04:47.931
But, I do have a plan
to try and convince him.

04:48.068 --> 04:50.241
We'll talk about it later,
I'm gonna need your help.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.241
The reality Ms. Walker

04:52.379 --> 04:54.137
is that Willy was carrying
a loaded gun on a city bus--

04:54.275 --> 04:56.620
That was for protection. That
gang was trying to kill him.

04:56.758 --> 04:59.068
I know. But we're going to have
to admit that he had the gun,

04:59.206 --> 05:01.482
so even if we get off
on the murder charge...

05:02.724 --> 05:04.068
How long will they
put him away for?

05:04.206 --> 05:06.413
Depends on which court
the case ends up in.

05:07.172 --> 05:09.379
Willy, I'm going to
need you to put this on.

05:10.689 --> 05:12.448
I just bought him
the suit he's wearing.

05:12.586 --> 05:14.517
- Yours looks too big.
- Exactly.

05:14.655 --> 05:16.034
Give me your watch.

05:16.241 --> 05:18.344
That's my father's watch,
I think it looks good on him.

05:18.482 --> 05:20.137
I don't want him
to look good Ms. Walker.

05:20.275 --> 05:22.482
I want him to look
like the child he is.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.482
He's facing life in adult court.

05:24.793 --> 05:27.034
Well, I can get parole
though, right? When I'm 21?

05:27.517 --> 05:28.965
There's no parole, Willy.

05:29.137 --> 05:31.000
Life is life in adult court.

05:33.758 --> 05:35.172
Here, take this.

05:37.862 --> 05:39.206
What is this for?

05:39.965 --> 05:41.103
For when you get bored.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.689
Six months
of social work, Judge.

05:42.827 --> 05:44.724
Report, after report,
after report.

05:44.862 --> 05:46.310
This is a good kid.

05:46.586 --> 05:48.620
A kid who made a mistake
of falling in with a gang.

05:48.758 --> 05:50.103
I'm just saying
in juvenile court,

05:50.241 --> 05:51.827
at least there's a chance
for rehabilitation.

05:51.965 --> 05:53.379
I've read your motion,
Ms. Sullivan,

05:53.517 --> 05:55.000
and I find it persuasive.

05:55.310 --> 05:57.931
But you know,
I don't have any power here.

05:58.206 --> 05:59.448
Mr. Duchay.

05:59.586 --> 06:01.137
The people haven't
changed their position.

06:01.379 --> 06:03.517
Your Honor, we could have
a hearing, if you'd indulge us.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.793
Mr. Duchay could cross examine
and make the decision.

06:07.310 --> 06:08.724
How's my day look, Meg?

06:08.862 --> 06:10.275
Your Honor, this is ridiculous.

06:10.413 --> 06:13.068
Oh, come on, Mr. Duchay,
what could it hurt?

06:15.862 --> 06:18.551
A 14 year-old's pre-frontal
cortex simply isn't fully

06:18.689 --> 06:21.344
developed enough to discern
higher order, right from wrong.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.137
Would that include
lack of impulse control?

06:23.275 --> 06:25.620
Absolutely. Adolescents lack
mature judgment

06:25.758 --> 06:27.724
and are highly
influenced by their peers.

06:31.172 --> 06:32.448
Can I help you?

06:32.586 --> 06:34.551
Perkins Boys School,
Law and Justice class.

06:34.689 --> 06:36.793
We're doing a report about
crime and punishment.

06:36.931 --> 06:39.689
If they act up, let them.
Hi boys.

06:41.586 --> 06:43.241
Just a happy coincidence?

06:44.034 --> 06:46.448
So, it's actually possible
for kids to do things,

06:46.586 --> 06:47.965
even violent things,

06:48.103 --> 06:49.551
with no adult appreciation
of what they're doing?

06:49.689 --> 06:51.344
Without question.
That's settled science.

06:51.482 --> 06:53.896
So is it possible that kids
who have done violent things

06:54.034 --> 06:56.103
can develop into mature
conscientious adults?

06:56.241 --> 06:57.758
That they can be rehabilitated?

06:57.896 --> 07:00.068
It's not merely possible,
it's commonplace.

07:00.310 --> 07:01.965
Kids change.

07:02.103 --> 07:03.724
In fact, Willy's been getting
A's and B's while in custody,

07:03.862 --> 07:05.931
where there are no gangs
trying to kill him.

07:06.448 --> 07:07.517
Thank you, Doctor.

07:08.206 --> 07:10.172
If I told you that
my five-year old nephew

07:10.310 --> 07:12.758
knows that lying is wrong,
would you dispute that?

07:12.896 --> 07:14.241
No.

07:14.379 --> 07:16.000
And most children know,
like these boys do now,

07:16.137 --> 07:17.689
that if they do something bad,
they will get in trouble.

07:17.827 --> 07:19.689
They could appreciate
the notion of consequences?

07:20.172 --> 07:21.689
Appreciating basic concepts
and engaging

07:21.827 --> 07:23.724
in genuine moral reasoning
are not the same thing.

07:23.862 --> 07:26.862
So, even if a child
knows right from wrong

07:27.000 --> 07:28.551
and can appreciate consequences,

07:28.689 --> 07:30.689
you still don't think
they should be held accountable

07:30.827 --> 07:32.172
for something like this?

07:34.137 --> 07:35.310
Seriously,
in front of the children?

07:35.448 --> 07:37.034
- Oh, please.
- All right.

07:37.172 --> 07:39.689
Given the disturbing nature
of the upcoming testimony,

07:39.827 --> 07:41.758
I'm clearing the courtroom
of all observers

07:41.896 --> 07:44.344
- under the age of 16.
- That's a good idea.

07:44.482 --> 07:45.896
Clearly, 14-year-old children

07:46.034 --> 07:47.793
do not have the capacity
that adults do

07:47.931 --> 07:49.724
to process
this kind of brutality.

07:49.862 --> 07:51.379
We shouldn't treat them
as if they did.

07:51.517 --> 07:52.896
You're not actually
trying to convince me

07:53.034 --> 07:55.000
with that little sideshow.

07:59.413 --> 08:00.827
Wow, Willy.

08:06.931 --> 08:08.448
Good morning, sunshine.

08:09.275 --> 08:10.655
I gotta deal
with this rookie today

08:10.793 --> 08:12.862
but if I make it to Part F,
could you call...

08:13.000 --> 08:14.724
my cases first? My day's insane.

08:14.862 --> 08:18.310
I don't know. Is there any way
you could return my calls?

08:25.448 --> 08:27.275
C.O's, butter them up.

08:27.448 --> 08:29.482
They can move your cases
to the top of the signing sheet.

08:29.620 --> 08:31.551
Assistant D.A.'s
know who you can work,

08:31.689 --> 08:33.931
- and who's out for blood.
- Always stay away from Duchay.

08:34.068 --> 08:35.724
Judge, learn
what pisses them off.

08:35.862 --> 08:37.551
And, if you need anything
from Judge Foley,

08:37.689 --> 08:40.206
make sure you get to her before
her 3 o'clock martini lunch.

08:40.344 --> 08:42.172
And Judge Miller, after his.

08:42.758 --> 08:44.000
You're going to do great.

08:46.413 --> 08:48.758
Willy's father passed away
when he was five,

08:48.896 --> 08:51.517
so he didn't much know him.
Which was a blessing.

08:51.655 --> 08:53.655
He was a violent man.

08:53.896 --> 08:56.413
Beat Willy, burned him
with cigarette butts.

08:56.689 --> 08:57.724
What about Willy's mother?

08:57.862 --> 09:00.896
My daughter Anita... drugs.

09:01.655 --> 09:03.275
She left Willy

09:03.413 --> 09:05.827
home once for four days
when he was six.

09:05.965 --> 09:07.793
I couldn't save her, but...

09:08.379 --> 09:09.827
I could take Willy in.

09:10.103 --> 09:11.103
Love him.

09:11.758 --> 09:14.379
What's Willy's life like
with you, Mrs. Walker?

09:14.965 --> 09:16.379
I did the best I could

09:16.724 --> 09:19.413
but I have two part time
jobs as a Nurse's Aide,

09:19.655 --> 09:21.206
I work 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.

09:21.344 --> 09:22.965
So, Willy raised himself?

09:24.241 --> 09:25.379
I tried,

09:26.724 --> 09:28.000
but I was never home.

09:28.931 --> 09:32.448
Is it true that Willy needed
a police escort to go to school?

09:32.931 --> 09:35.517
They made one of those--
you called--

09:35.965 --> 09:37.586
safe corridors for the kids

09:37.724 --> 09:40.241
on account of gangs
trying to recruit them.

09:40.448 --> 09:43.206
Yet he did join a gang,
the 110th Street Posse.

09:43.344 --> 09:46.310
Those gangs, they make
themselves seem like family.

09:46.758 --> 09:48.689
With me working so much...

09:49.379 --> 09:51.379
He is a good boy but they...

09:52.172 --> 09:54.103
snatched him out of my hands.

09:54.931 --> 09:56.344
Willy is 14,

09:56.482 --> 09:59.275
he won't survive one week
in an adult prison.

09:59.517 --> 10:02.172
Your Honor, please. You have
to listen to me. He is good.

10:02.310 --> 10:06.000
I need you to confine yourself
to the questions, Ms. Walker.

10:09.793 --> 10:11.413
Nothing further.

10:21.137 --> 10:22.517
You love your grandson.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.379
Kept a close eye on him.

10:25.068 --> 10:26.103
I tried.

10:26.413 --> 10:28.517
Did everything you could
to raise him right?

10:28.655 --> 10:32.310
Yes, sir.
Chores, church, respect.

10:32.655 --> 10:34.413
Tried to instill good values,

10:34.551 --> 10:36.068
taught him right from wrong.

10:37.655 --> 10:40.793
Mr. Duchay, you grew up
in Crown Heights didn't you?

10:41.310 --> 10:42.413
Excuse me?

10:42.551 --> 10:44.172
Your mother
was a school teacher,

10:44.379 --> 10:46.034
and your father drove a bus.

10:49.413 --> 10:51.000
Ms. Walker, I ask the questions.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.586
There's no jury here,
Mr. Duchay.

10:52.724 --> 10:54.241
Just you
and the boy's grandmother.

10:54.379 --> 10:56.827
I think it's fair to give her
a chance to convince you.

10:59.172 --> 11:01.827
Ms. Walker, I'm not on trial
for being a gang member

11:01.965 --> 11:03.413
or shooting an innocent man.

11:03.551 --> 11:08.103
Well, young man, if you had been
burned with cigarettes

11:08.793 --> 11:10.758
and left for days
by your mother,

11:10.931 --> 11:12.724
out of her mind on heroine,

11:12.965 --> 11:17.413
found starving and wet
and shaken in a closet,

11:18.137 --> 11:19.862
maybe you would
have joined a gang,

11:20.448 --> 11:21.931
and you would be on trial.

11:22.068 --> 11:24.137
- I don't think so.
- You so sure about that?

11:29.068 --> 11:31.241
Your grandson
had choices, Ms. Walker.

11:31.827 --> 11:33.241
He has to answer
for those choices.

11:33.379 --> 11:34.482
He is a child.

11:34.793 --> 11:36.586
I know people
want to look at black boys

11:36.724 --> 11:38.275
and see them like men.

11:38.413 --> 11:40.586
They don't get the benefit
that those white boys are--

11:40.724 --> 11:42.310
Race has nothing
to do with it.

11:42.448 --> 11:43.862
You said you have a nephew.

11:44.034 --> 11:46.000
If he didn't have
the family you have,

11:46.275 --> 11:48.862
if he had done
something terrible,

11:49.034 --> 11:52.344
would you just lock him up
forever and throw away the key?

11:53.517 --> 11:55.344
Would you just give up on him?

11:56.586 --> 11:59.827
Please, he's just a boy.

12:01.827 --> 12:03.379
I'm sorry, Ms. Walker,

12:04.275 --> 12:06.241
I have another family
to answer to.

12:08.931 --> 12:10.689
Your grandson
acted like an adult

12:10.827 --> 12:13.034
when he killed
Private Sanchez.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.172
He's going to have
to answer as one.

12:28.172 --> 12:29.586
Willy?

12:31.827 --> 12:33.413
Willy?

12:35.517 --> 12:36.896
You guys mind?

12:43.103 --> 12:44.241
Where are your shoes?

12:48.620 --> 12:49.655
Okay.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.620
We have to try
to convince the jury

12:51.758 --> 12:54.275
that you acted in self defense
when you fired that gun.

12:54.413 --> 12:55.689
How do we do that?

12:55.827 --> 12:57.448
Well you said
you carried the gun that day

12:57.586 --> 12:58.827
because Thrill to Kill
threatened you on social media.

12:58.965 --> 13:00.413
Where'd you see it?

13:00.551 --> 13:01.655
I didn't see it but my boys
were telling me about it.

13:01.793 --> 13:03.068
Okay, I need those pages.

13:03.206 --> 13:05.034
Otherwise, we cannot
prove a prior threat.

13:05.551 --> 13:08.448
Now tell me again, what happened
on the day of the shooting?

13:08.655 --> 13:10.931
So, I got shot at on the street
then I ran on the bus

13:11.068 --> 13:13.344
- and them fools came after me.
- Why did you have a gun?

13:13.482 --> 13:14.931
'Cause you can't be
lacking in these streets.

13:15.068 --> 13:17.896
No! "Only to protect myself."

13:18.034 --> 13:20.172
Repeat that until
you say it in your sleep.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.413
What happened next?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.137
So, I got on the 37 bus,
in the back.

13:25.275 --> 13:26.758
The same three fools
stopped the bus

13:26.896 --> 13:28.517
and tried to hold the door open.

13:28.655 --> 13:30.758
Then one of them came at to me,
so I had to do what I had to do.

13:30.896 --> 13:32.448
I let out
the first shot, pop pop.

13:32.586 --> 13:34.206
Glasses fired, people
was running everywhere.

13:34.344 --> 13:37.206
Willy! If you talk
like that on the stand,

13:37.344 --> 13:39.241
you will be imprisoned
until you die,

13:39.379 --> 13:40.758
do you understand me?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.724
Now we got a bunch of problems.

13:44.862 --> 13:46.793
You know the police, they found
some of the Thrill to Kill guys

13:46.931 --> 13:48.241
but none of them had weapons.

13:48.379 --> 13:51.034
Without weapons, we have
no claim of self defense.

13:51.344 --> 13:53.068
Guess what else?
The prosecution,

13:53.206 --> 13:55.689
they got this photo of you,
smart ass,

13:55.827 --> 13:58.551
holding a gun
like you're an OG.

13:59.068 --> 14:02.137
Even worse,
you shot an innocent bystander.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.896
A 25-year-old Iraq war veteran.

14:06.448 --> 14:07.827
Today's problem is you.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.689
You act like it was
a first-person shooter game.

14:09.827 --> 14:11.068
You sound like
you've done hard time.

14:11.206 --> 14:13.344
That shit is not
going to work for you.

14:17.172 --> 14:19.103
- He smiled at me...
- Who smiled at you?

14:19.241 --> 14:21.517
The soldier.
The one that died on the bus.

14:23.068 --> 14:25.206
He smiled at me.
People never do that.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.689
I should have just smiled back.

14:32.310 --> 14:33.655
Okay.

14:35.586 --> 14:38.068
Tell me what happened
to your shoes. The truth.

14:41.068 --> 14:42.620
The big guys,
they took them from me.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.068
That right there.

14:45.206 --> 14:49.206
Willy. I need this version
of you every day in court.

14:51.034 --> 14:52.344
This is the version of Willy

14:52.482 --> 14:54.551
that might keep you
out of prison. Okay?

15:00.793 --> 15:02.413
I'm asking you to preclude it.

15:02.551 --> 15:04.793
It's irrelevant and more
prejudicial than prohibitive.

15:04.931 --> 15:06.241
It proves the defendant's
gang membership

15:06.379 --> 15:07.758
and goes to show state of mind.

15:07.896 --> 15:09.344
It's a pose, let's face it,
the only reason

15:09.482 --> 15:11.000
why the prosecution
wants this photo in

15:11.137 --> 15:12.965
is to paint my client
as a scary black boy.

15:13.103 --> 15:14.931
When the news media wanted
to paint Trayvon Martin

15:15.068 --> 15:17.137
as a bad kid,
they posted this picture,

15:17.275 --> 15:18.862
instead of this picture.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.965
Mr. Duchay is trying to do the
same thing with the gun photo.

15:21.103 --> 15:23.655
He's trying to paint
a portrait of a scary black boy,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.758
but my client was scared too.

15:26.758 --> 15:29.206
Look, I have a subpoena
for the social media pages

15:29.344 --> 15:31.241
of three Thrill to Kill members
who threatened Willy.

15:31.379 --> 15:33.172
If Mr. Duchay
gets to put his photos in,

15:33.310 --> 15:34.862
I should be able
to put theirs in too.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.241
You want to make this a trial

15:36.379 --> 15:37.793
about scary black boys,
Judge, let's go.

15:38.310 --> 15:41.379
The subpoena is denied,
and the gun photo is out.

15:41.517 --> 15:42.758
Moving on.

15:42.896 --> 15:44.034
Everybody's lying.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.000
Don't expect the truth
until they trust you.

15:46.137 --> 15:47.344
Remember, you're the lawyer,

15:47.482 --> 15:49.137
so be confident
and authoritative.

15:49.275 --> 15:50.758
- Confident and authoritative.
- Manage their expectations.

15:50.896 --> 15:52.379
If you say three days
of community service,

15:52.517 --> 15:54.103
and they get four,
they're going to be pissed,

15:54.241 --> 15:55.551
but if you say they're going
to be in jail for a month

15:55.689 --> 15:57.275
and they get
those same four days,

15:57.413 --> 15:58.724
they'll think you're a champ.

15:58.862 --> 15:59.827
Lie to them about
what they're going to get--

15:59.965 --> 16:01.482
Not lie. Manage.

16:01.620 --> 16:03.379
Underpromise, overdeliver.

16:03.655 --> 16:06.103
You're going to do great.
Peters!

16:14.689 --> 16:16.206
Mr. Peters,

16:18.034 --> 16:20.000
I'm the attorney that's
been assigned to you today.

16:20.655 --> 16:22.068
It says here
that you were caught

16:22.206 --> 16:24.137
in possession of burglar tools.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.413
A lock pick?

16:25.724 --> 16:27.000
Is that what happened?

16:28.034 --> 16:29.482
I had no lock pick.

16:31.413 --> 16:32.275
Okay.

16:32.413 --> 16:33.724
You really want to go with that?

16:34.413 --> 16:36.241
Look, I get it.
You don't trust her.

16:36.379 --> 16:38.068
And you think
because she's a PD she sucks.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.724
But the reason that
we're doing this job,

16:39.896 --> 16:42.034
we wanna be private attorneys
and make some money,

16:42.172 --> 16:44.034
which means we need
to build good reputations,

16:44.172 --> 16:46.275
and we do that by winning cases.

16:46.482 --> 16:49.000
So, if we think your case is
a loser, we'll tell you to plea.

16:49.137 --> 16:51.758
But if we think you can win
or beat them on a technicality,

16:51.896 --> 16:54.172
we'll file.
You good with that?

16:54.862 --> 16:56.103
Hell yeah,
I'm good with that.

16:56.241 --> 16:57.482
So what happened?

16:57.620 --> 16:59.620
So, I had the lock pick

17:00.172 --> 17:01.793
but the cops
were sweeping the block.

17:01.931 --> 17:03.827
They searched me before they
even asked for my name.

17:04.034 --> 17:06.793
Okay then.
We'll do a Motion to Suppress.

17:11.034 --> 17:13.793
All that stuff about wanting
to be a private attorney,

17:13.965 --> 17:15.965
total bullshit.
I don't care how you do it,

17:16.103 --> 17:18.344
but you gotta find a way to get
your clients to trust you.

17:18.482 --> 17:19.655
Especially you.

17:19.793 --> 17:21.689
You look and act
just like a prosecutor.

17:27.034 --> 17:28.551
I know you have a booty call.

17:29.068 --> 17:30.379
Excuse me?

17:30.551 --> 17:32.034
I know you're getting some.
What I don't know is

17:32.172 --> 17:33.448
why you haven't told
a sister who it is.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.137
And what makes you think that?

17:35.275 --> 17:36.586
Oh girl, bye.

17:36.724 --> 17:38.241
You accuse me of having
an "I got some" glow,

17:38.379 --> 17:40.275
you look like you swallowed
the whole damn sun.

17:40.413 --> 17:43.758
- Okay, yes. I got some.
- I knew it!

17:43.896 --> 17:45.413
I gave some, actually.

17:45.551 --> 17:46.793
Give me seven questions.

17:46.931 --> 17:48.758
Uh-uh, we're due in court,
you get three.

17:49.206 --> 17:50.655
- He works downtown.
- That's a statement,

17:50.793 --> 17:52.482
- not a yes or no.
- Okay. Fine.

17:52.620 --> 17:53.758
- Is he blue collar?
- No.

17:53.896 --> 17:55.241
Have I met him?

17:55.931 --> 17:57.344
- Yes.
- Really?

17:57.482 --> 17:58.620
Okay.

17:59.448 --> 18:01.793
I got it. Richard Berkowitz
from Park 60.

18:01.931 --> 18:03.172
Gwen, it's not B.O Berkowitz.

18:03.310 --> 18:04.965
- He's cute.
- No, he's not cute.

18:05.103 --> 18:08.103
And speaking of sex, what is the
deal with you and Bennet?

18:08.241 --> 18:11.758
And Charlie, who actually
likes you by the way.

18:11.931 --> 18:13.448
Charlie doesn't like
anyone but himself.

18:13.586 --> 18:15.137
He can never be serious,
it is exhausting.

18:15.275 --> 18:17.137
And there is no comparison
between him and Bennet.

18:17.275 --> 18:20.310
Okay. Well, where is Mr. Brown
taking you to dinner tonight?

18:20.448 --> 18:21.344
Cap Perou.

18:21.482 --> 18:22.689
- To Cap Perou?
- Yes.

18:22.827 --> 18:24.896
But it's not a date,
it's just dinner.

18:25.034 --> 18:26.724
No friend of mine
is taking me to Cap Perou.

18:26.862 --> 18:28.758
I heard the judge
denied your subpoena.

18:29.551 --> 18:31.103
How are you going to prove
the prior threat to Willy?

18:31.241 --> 18:32.689
Pinky was never going
to give me that subpoena.

18:32.827 --> 18:34.275
I gave up something
I was never going to get,

18:34.413 --> 18:36.551
in order to keep
Willy's picture out of evidence.

18:36.689 --> 18:38.275
Besides, your girl always
has a plan B.

18:38.413 --> 18:40.206
- What's plan B?
- I am glad you asked.

18:40.344 --> 18:41.758
I need you take off your bra.

18:42.034 --> 18:43.551
We are going to
create a fake page

18:43.689 --> 18:45.862
- using you, Cardi V, as bait.
- This should be good.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.034
Now, if any of the Thrill to
Kill members friend you,

18:48.172 --> 18:50.137
then we have access
to the posted messages.

18:50.689 --> 18:51.931
Yeah, that's going to be a no.

18:52.068 --> 18:54.000
I don't intermingle
with gangs, ever.

18:54.379 --> 18:56.241
You're going to give up
the bra, sweetie?

18:56.482 --> 18:57.931
Or am I going to
have to take it?

18:58.068 --> 18:59.103
Come on,

19:00.172 --> 19:01.310
do it for justice.

19:01.655 --> 19:03.137
Justice.

19:09.827 --> 19:11.482
Did I read it?

19:12.413 --> 19:14.000
Oh my God, the snort.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.655
- I forgot all about the snort.
- So, did I.

19:16.793 --> 19:19.172
I haven't laughed
this hard in so long.

19:19.793 --> 19:21.758
Okay. Tell me about your book.

19:22.137 --> 19:25.172
Well, it's another crime novel.
Set in Brooklyn,

19:25.310 --> 19:28.172
the panorama of one city
breaking down in one suburb.

19:28.310 --> 19:30.137
Because another unarmed
young black man

19:30.275 --> 19:31.620
was gunned down by the police?

19:31.758 --> 19:33.517
Mm-hmm. Something like that.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.172
But I don't wanna
talk about my book.

19:35.310 --> 19:36.517
I wanna talk about you.

19:36.862 --> 19:38.724
How are you, Gwen?
Fill me in.

19:38.931 --> 19:40.379
Well, I have
an unconstitutionally

19:40.517 --> 19:41.724
high caseload.

19:41.862 --> 19:43.137
Not a day goes by,
somebody doesn't ask

19:43.275 --> 19:44.758
"How can you
represent criminals?"

19:45.103 --> 19:46.586
And my clients
are presumed guilty

19:46.724 --> 19:47.793
until proven innocent.

19:47.931 --> 19:49.827
- But you love it.
- Damn straight.

19:49.965 --> 19:51.482
Look at you.

19:51.620 --> 19:54.551
Here I am writing about
Philando Castile or Tamir Rice.

19:54.689 --> 19:57.551
But you, you're doing
something about it. Respect.

19:57.896 --> 19:58.896
Thanks.

19:59.034 --> 20:00.344
Must be exhausting.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.206
I do crave eight hours
of uninterrupted sleep.

20:03.344 --> 20:04.586
No, I mean mentally.

20:04.724 --> 20:06.379
You spend all day
fighting for other people,

20:06.689 --> 20:08.517
You got anybody
taking care of you?

20:09.275 --> 20:10.379
I got Tracy.

20:10.827 --> 20:12.344
It's not the same thing.

20:16.206 --> 20:18.241
You know, assuming
that I get the okay,

20:19.172 --> 20:22.206
I plan on embedding myself
into defender's association.

20:22.517 --> 20:23.862
To research my book.

20:24.172 --> 20:27.000
Which means you're gonna have to
deal with me for a little while.

20:27.655 --> 20:30.172
I'll continue to make you
laugh until you snort.

20:31.137 --> 20:32.551
That sounds great.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.448
So, here's to
old friends reconnecting.

20:34.586 --> 20:36.206
I'll drink to that.

20:42.827 --> 20:44.827
The electric bill
is due tomorrow.

20:45.034 --> 20:46.379
I got you.

20:46.517 --> 20:48.310
They're serious about
shutting us off this time.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.655
Okay.

20:50.172 --> 20:52.655
So, start spilling
the sweet tea.

20:52.965 --> 20:54.379
How was the date?

20:54.517 --> 20:57.137
He is a tall glass
of "Yes, please."

20:57.275 --> 20:58.689
He's too good to be true.

20:58.827 --> 21:00.689
I have never heard you
talk that way about a guy.

21:01.068 --> 21:03.689
I can't stop thinking about him.
Bennet is a real man.

21:03.827 --> 21:07.034
He's not a scrub,
he's not a boy, he's not a game,

21:07.172 --> 21:08.931
he speaks to my spirit.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.586
He asked me
provocative questions

21:10.724 --> 21:12.655
that make me stop and think,
I didn't want it to end.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.448
So, did y'all crazy kiss-kiss,

21:14.586 --> 21:16.620
confessed your love,
and get matching tattoos?

21:16.758 --> 21:18.551
Hell no, that's some
white girl shit.

21:18.724 --> 21:20.310
Desperation is not
a good look, no offense.

21:20.448 --> 21:22.137
Honey, there's a difference

21:22.275 --> 21:23.896
between desperate and honest,
just tell the man how you feel.

21:24.034 --> 21:26.172
He's a celebrity and he used to
be my law professor.

21:26.310 --> 21:27.793
It would never work.

21:27.931 --> 21:30.241
Enough with the nevers,
just tell him how you feel.

21:30.448 --> 21:31.965
Oh my God, I would rather die.

21:32.103 --> 21:33.965
Before you do that,
electric bill.

21:35.310 --> 21:38.965
Robbery, robbery,
come on robbery.

21:39.103 --> 21:40.413
You can take my burglary.

21:40.551 --> 21:42.310
Forget it. I hate burglars.
They're sneaky.

21:42.448 --> 21:44.379
At least robbers have the balls
to hold a gun to your face.

21:44.517 --> 21:46.000
Okay, how about Teddy Larsen?

21:46.137 --> 21:47.551
I just had one, darlin'.

21:47.689 --> 21:50.379
Drug sale, possession,
drug sale, menace--

21:50.517 --> 21:52.758
All right, hello!

21:52.931 --> 21:54.275
Then I get your assault too.

21:54.413 --> 21:55.620
You can have my CPW too.

21:55.758 --> 21:56.931
- Deal.
- Deal.

21:57.103 --> 21:58.103
Thank you.

22:00.310 --> 22:03.172
When we arrived on scene,
the bus was empty.

22:03.620 --> 22:05.620
There were people
lying in the street bleeding.

22:06.068 --> 22:09.103
Several of the passengers
had been struck by flying glass.

22:09.379 --> 22:10.827
A male was deceased,

22:12.034 --> 22:14.172
a veteran who had just
come back from overseas.

22:14.379 --> 22:16.172
And after you arrested
the defendant,

22:16.310 --> 22:17.586
did he make a statement?

22:17.724 --> 22:19.000
He stated...

22:21.655 --> 22:24.068
"I heard Trigger Fiend
and his set was coming for me,

22:24.206 --> 22:25.896
they shot at me,
so I shot back."

22:26.034 --> 22:27.517
Did you voucher any evidence?

22:28.034 --> 22:31.034
The defendant had a 32-caliber
revolver in his waist band.

22:31.172 --> 22:32.896
Mr. Walker claims that
he was shot at first

22:33.034 --> 22:35.724
in the street at that location
were shell casings recovered?

22:35.862 --> 22:38.068
We had reports of shots
fired on the street.

22:38.379 --> 22:39.827
No casings were found.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.034
A revolver would not eject
casing so it made me think

22:42.172 --> 22:43.517
- that whoever fired the shots--
- Objection!

22:43.655 --> 22:45.482
- Had a revolver.
- Sustained.

22:46.931 --> 22:48.655
No further questions.

22:52.172 --> 22:53.793
If Thrill to Kill had revolvers,

22:53.931 --> 22:56.344
it would be entirely possible
that they shot first, right?

22:56.586 --> 22:58.586
We know that
the defendant had a revolver.

22:58.793 --> 23:00.655
We know there were
no casings found, so--

23:00.793 --> 23:03.551
So, whoever shot,
had a revolver.

23:03.827 --> 23:06.206
But a revolver is a very
common weapon, right?

23:07.310 --> 23:10.034
- Yes.
- Thank you. Nothing further.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.965
My eyes must be
playing tricks on me.

23:22.103 --> 23:24.241
I thought I'd find a case
that plays to my strengths.

23:24.379 --> 23:25.689
And what are those exactly?

23:25.827 --> 23:27.413
Rookie's over here,
trying to cherry pick.

23:27.793 --> 23:29.793
- But you and Tracy did it.
- There's a difference

23:29.931 --> 23:31.551
between horse trading
and cherry picking.

23:31.689 --> 23:33.068
Horse trading is collaborative,

23:33.206 --> 23:35.137
cherry picking
is the worst kind of selfish.

23:35.344 --> 23:37.586
But, I just want a chance
to defend the innocent.

23:37.724 --> 23:39.448
When you see one
of those float by here,

23:39.586 --> 23:40.896
you let me know. Okay?

23:41.034 --> 23:42.793
Here's an indecent
exposure to keep you busy.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.000
Spoiler alert: He did it.

23:50.482 --> 23:51.724
We were coming back from seeing

23:51.862 --> 23:53.448
Miguel's brother's
new baby daughter.

23:53.586 --> 23:55.517
And, we got on the 37 bus.

23:55.896 --> 23:57.172
And what happened?

23:57.413 --> 23:58.758
At first, there was yelling.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.620
A bunch of boys stopped the bus.

24:00.758 --> 24:02.724
One of them was
holding the door open

24:02.862 --> 24:04.241
and another one got on.

24:04.655 --> 24:07.034
I looked behind me
and I saw him pull out a gun.

24:07.206 --> 24:08.482
What did you do?

24:08.620 --> 24:10.793
I screamed.
Miguel was sitting next to me.

24:11.206 --> 24:12.862
I grabbed his arm
and I could feel

24:13.000 --> 24:14.586
he was all tensed up.

24:15.793 --> 24:19.000
He was in go mode
from his training. He stood up.

24:20.413 --> 24:22.724
And I heard a loud pop.

24:23.655 --> 24:26.448
Something soft hit me
on the right side of my face.

24:27.758 --> 24:28.827
It was...

24:30.758 --> 24:32.517
It was part of his head.

24:33.241 --> 24:34.413
His head.

24:35.448 --> 24:37.000
There was blood everywhere.

24:37.689 --> 24:39.172
I grabbed him in my arms

24:39.482 --> 24:41.310
but there was nothing
I could do.

24:42.862 --> 24:44.448
I have nothing further.

24:46.965 --> 24:48.448
No questions, your honor.

25:05.068 --> 25:06.655
Bye, love you.

25:10.482 --> 25:12.172
I love you guys,
I'll see you soon.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.000
Oh, hi, Vanessa!

25:14.896 --> 25:16.275
And Vanessa's driver.

25:16.758 --> 25:18.034
Your entourage?

25:18.448 --> 25:20.586
This is Tracy.
The one I told you about.

25:20.724 --> 25:22.827
This is Kevin and Catherine,
my parents.

25:25.862 --> 25:29.551
Well, it is a pleasure
to meet you both.

25:31.068 --> 25:32.068
Wow.

25:32.482 --> 25:34.172
They've gotta go.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.586
Parents. Wow.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.034
Any chance you'll
keep this to yourself?

25:42.896 --> 25:43.896
What do you think?

25:55.206 --> 25:57.379
- I don't want to testify.
- We have no choice.

25:57.517 --> 25:59.965
You saw the jury's reaction
to the widow's testimony.

26:00.137 --> 26:03.689
The prosecution now has emotion
and patriotism on their side.

26:04.206 --> 26:06.068
- But what do we have?
- You.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.793
Let them know you, Willy.
Let them know your story.

26:08.931 --> 26:10.758
Just drop the banger act.

26:12.172 --> 26:14.034
But what about that
Duchay guy though?

26:14.206 --> 26:15.517
He's going to go after you.

26:15.655 --> 26:16.862
But that's okay because
I get to come back

26:17.000 --> 26:18.551
and fix whatever
he tried to break.

26:18.689 --> 26:20.137
That's called a redirect.

26:20.965 --> 26:23.103
I'm going to be with you
every step of the way.

26:23.862 --> 26:25.206
You can do this.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.586
Willy, when the other boys got
on the bus, what did you think?

26:32.344 --> 26:33.862
I knew they were
going to kill me.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.758
How sure were you that
they were coming to kill you?

26:35.896 --> 26:37.068
It was all over the net.

26:37.206 --> 26:38.724
My friends were
telling me about it.

26:39.413 --> 26:40.655
They were coming for me.

26:41.206 --> 26:42.896
Then they shot at me
on the street.

26:43.034 --> 26:44.965
Were you scared? Is that why
you shot your gun on the bus?

26:45.103 --> 26:46.241
Yeah, I had to.

26:46.379 --> 26:47.758
You thought
you were going to die.

26:47.931 --> 26:49.241
Yeah.

26:50.344 --> 26:52.137
I didn't wanna die.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.172
I'm sorry about your husband.

26:56.931 --> 26:58.586
I didn't mean for anyone to die.

27:00.275 --> 27:02.000
I just wanted to protect myself.

27:04.379 --> 27:05.827
No further questions.

27:10.551 --> 27:12.275
You had a loaded gun
on you that day

27:12.413 --> 27:13.965
because you knew
the guys on the bus

27:14.103 --> 27:15.448
were from a rival gang
that were trying to kill you.

27:15.586 --> 27:16.896
Yes.

27:17.034 --> 27:18.344
And that's what rival
gang members do right?

27:18.482 --> 27:19.931
They try to kill each other.

27:20.068 --> 27:22.793
- I never tried to kill anybody.
- But you're in a war.

27:24.206 --> 27:26.517
- I guess.
- In a way, you're a warrior.

27:26.655 --> 27:27.827
I mean being in a gang war

27:27.965 --> 27:29.448
is almost like being
in combat, right?

27:30.965 --> 27:32.448
Yeah, it's kind of like that.

27:32.896 --> 27:34.310
I have nothing further.

27:49.896 --> 27:51.655
The People rest,
Your Honor.

27:51.793 --> 27:52.931
Miss Sullivan!

27:53.103 --> 27:54.275
Gwen!

27:54.724 --> 27:56.103
Just one moment judge.

27:57.137 --> 27:58.413
- It worked!
- What?

27:58.551 --> 28:00.655
Trigger Fiend,
accepted my friend request.

28:00.793 --> 28:02.172
Let me see that.

28:02.413 --> 28:04.275
Thank you, Cardi V.

28:04.413 --> 28:06.137
Okay, I need you to testify.

28:06.275 --> 28:08.517
What? When?

28:09.758 --> 28:13.206
Did you recently create
a social media account?

28:13.344 --> 28:14.517
Yes.

28:14.655 --> 28:16.172
And what did you do
with this account?

28:16.310 --> 28:18.655
I friended Trigger Fiend
from the Thrill to Kill gang.

28:18.793 --> 28:21.931
He friended me back
and so did Lil Trigger,

28:22.068 --> 28:25.000
Young Trigger, Big Trigger,
Trigger the Enigma and--

28:25.137 --> 28:27.655
Okay, did you have access
to Trigger Fiend's full page?

28:27.793 --> 28:28.896
Yes.

28:29.034 --> 28:30.413
And a week
prior to the shooting,

28:30.551 --> 28:32.137
he was making
constant threats towards Willy.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.724
Could you read some samples?

28:34.241 --> 28:35.551
"Let me catch him in the street,

28:35.689 --> 28:37.793
on God, I'm a clap
his little punk ass."

28:38.137 --> 28:39.517
And on the day of the shooting,

28:39.758 --> 28:43.517
"Almost got him, but the boy
skated like a bitch".

28:44.206 --> 28:46.241
Thank you. Nothing further.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.517
I understand you jumped
a turnstile, Mr. Dorinsky.

28:59.965 --> 29:02.344
I lost my fluro cones,
it was stupid.

29:02.689 --> 29:03.862
Well, you don't have a record

29:04.000 --> 29:05.448
so they'll probably just
give you an ACD.

29:06.103 --> 29:08.793
That's an adjournment
and they'll dismiss it

29:08.931 --> 29:11.482
when you do a day of community
service or you pay a fine.

29:11.620 --> 29:12.827
That's it?

29:13.206 --> 29:14.482
Thank God.

29:18.655 --> 29:20.413
Your Honor, the people
request that the court

29:20.551 --> 29:22.620
instruct the jury
on combat by agreement.

29:22.965 --> 29:24.137
Wait, what?

29:24.551 --> 29:27.620
Are you kidding? Are we
teleporting back to 1789 here?

29:27.758 --> 29:29.068
If the court finds

29:29.206 --> 29:30.379
that the defendant's
gang and another gang

29:30.517 --> 29:31.965
get an ongoing understanding

29:32.103 --> 29:34.172
that every time they see
each other, violence will ensue,

29:34.413 --> 29:36.655
then the gun firing on the bus
was a consensual fight.

29:36.896 --> 29:39.241
Much like a duel.
Or a boxing match.

29:39.655 --> 29:40.931
Under the common law,

29:41.068 --> 29:42.724
a claim of self defense
is therefore void.

29:43.379 --> 29:45.827
Judge, this is insane.
The definition is so specific,

29:45.965 --> 29:47.068
the jury would have
no other choice

29:47.206 --> 29:48.448
but to convict my client.

29:49.206 --> 29:51.241
It's an original argument,
Mr. Duchay,

29:51.655 --> 29:53.689
but I will not
instruct the jury that way.

29:53.827 --> 29:56.275
However, I will allow you
to argue the concept

29:56.413 --> 29:57.896
in your summation.

29:58.034 --> 29:59.896
Let the jury decide whether
self defense should apply.

30:00.034 --> 30:02.103
- But judge even if--
- We're adjourned.

30:13.862 --> 30:15.862
Hey! There's a line!

30:16.000 --> 30:16.827
Come on!

30:31.103 --> 30:32.275
Busy!

30:43.068 --> 30:44.517
Come on, lady!

30:49.655 --> 30:50.965
Sorry, bad hotdog.

30:51.103 --> 30:52.448
Oh wait, hey ma'am.

30:52.586 --> 30:54.344
Hi. I need to talk to you
about something,

30:54.482 --> 30:55.862
it's just part of my process.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.482
Could you just stand there
and listen for me.

30:57.620 --> 30:58.862
So, in my case I proved
the existence of threat

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
but then they said gang war,

31:01.137 --> 31:03.172
so no self defense,
so I'm screwed, right?

31:03.310 --> 31:05.586
Exactly.
I need to humanize him.

31:05.724 --> 31:07.482
You guys can listen in too.
It's going to help me.

31:07.620 --> 31:09.068
I need to humanize him.

31:09.206 --> 31:11.517
Explain to these jurors
why a kid joined the gang.

31:11.655 --> 31:12.862
It's cause he doesn't have a dad

31:13.000 --> 31:14.103
and there's
no one there to explain

31:14.241 --> 31:15.896
why not having a dad matters.

31:16.034 --> 31:19.206
Yes. Yes. I need an expert.
No. no.

31:20.758 --> 31:22.000
I need a gang expert.

31:22.137 --> 31:23.620
Exactly.
I need a gang expert.

31:23.758 --> 31:26.172
Thank you. You too.
It takes a village.

31:28.413 --> 31:30.517
So, her parents are white-white?

31:30.655 --> 31:33.172
They're not like,
Amber Rose, Steph Curry,

31:33.310 --> 31:35.206
light-skinned,
vanilla latte black?

31:35.620 --> 31:37.896
Sugar, they're
as white as sugar.

31:38.068 --> 31:40.103
Your honor, this is
a simple fare evasion,

31:40.241 --> 31:41.413
it's a first offense.

31:41.551 --> 31:42.896
Actually, Your Honor,

31:43.034 --> 31:44.448
the people would like
to dismiss the charges.

31:44.793 --> 31:46.068
Really?

31:46.275 --> 31:48.517
There's a warrant,
page four of the rap sheet.

31:49.034 --> 31:50.206
Wait what?

31:53.000 --> 31:54.551
You had a first degree
assault conviction

31:54.689 --> 31:55.689
fifteen years ago?

31:55.827 --> 31:57.413
- No, I didn't.
- Look.

31:58.068 --> 32:01.103
These are based
on your fingerprints.

32:01.241 --> 32:04.448
You tell me, this 100% isn't you
and we'll fight it.

32:04.586 --> 32:07.000
Yes, yes,
I had a convicted case.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.241
Skipped out on the trial,

32:10.620 --> 32:12.103
but still
sentenced to ten years.

32:12.413 --> 32:14.482
I freaked out, I thought he was
going to come and get me,

32:14.620 --> 32:15.931
but he never did.

32:16.241 --> 32:17.413
What does this mean?

32:17.551 --> 32:19.931
It means he's going
to prison. Now.

32:21.586 --> 32:23.137
Sonya, my wife,
she doesn't know.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.586
Isn't there something we can do?

32:25.275 --> 32:28.103
Your honor, we request
that a reasonable bill

32:28.241 --> 32:30.241
be set while we investigate
the circumstances

32:30.379 --> 32:31.862
of his sentencing and absentia.

32:32.137 --> 32:34.172
Mr. Dolinsky has been
an upstanding citizen

32:34.310 --> 32:37.172
- for over 15 years.
- Forget it, Mr. Rigs.

32:37.310 --> 32:39.103
He jumped bail 15 years ago.

32:39.241 --> 32:41.862
I'm not giving him
the opportunity to do it again.

32:42.275 --> 32:43.827
I am executing the sentence.

32:43.965 --> 32:45.862
What? Wait, come on.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.758
- What's happening?
- My wife.

32:47.896 --> 32:49.137
Excuse me.

32:49.275 --> 32:50.275
- Just wait, wait!
- Just talk to my wife.

32:50.413 --> 32:51.862
- Please.
- Vajir?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.586
- Sonya, I'm--
- What's happening?

32:54.137 --> 32:55.896
Mrs. Dolinsky,
let's talk outside.

32:56.758 --> 32:59.000
No, I'm not leaving until
you tell me what's going on.

32:59.137 --> 33:01.034
Okay, then stay here,
but sit down, let's talk.

33:01.172 --> 33:02.551
Sit down please.

33:18.620 --> 33:20.448
it's like legal dinner theater.

33:20.586 --> 33:22.379
How do you know
this so-called expert?

33:22.517 --> 33:24.068
He's a former client
and he's currently

33:24.206 --> 33:26.172
serving a life sentence
on a Federal reco case.

33:26.310 --> 33:28.172
- He's not even an expert.
- Oh for God's sakes,

33:28.310 --> 33:30.793
Mr. Duchay, I'm letting you
argue combat by agreement.

33:30.931 --> 33:32.551
- But your honor, I mean--
- Dinner theater

33:32.689 --> 33:34.448
can be entertaining.

33:47.482 --> 33:50.551
It's simple. If you're not
with the 110, you're the enemy.

33:50.689 --> 33:53.517
- And 110 is 110th Street Posse?
- That's right.

33:53.655 --> 33:55.310
Could you tell me
what OG means?

33:55.448 --> 33:58.724
Original Gangster.
That's me. That's my peoples.

33:59.275 --> 34:01.586
Teach 'em shorties
right from wrong, you know?

34:03.241 --> 34:04.620
What do they get out of it?

34:04.827 --> 34:07.068
Community, protection,
it's a family.

34:07.241 --> 34:11.000
So, what if someone like Willy,
were to just say no?

34:11.137 --> 34:12.965
Nobody says no to me.

34:13.379 --> 34:14.655
Not in my neighborhood.

34:15.034 --> 34:16.620
We beg a shorty to join our set,

34:17.103 --> 34:19.206
you either say yes,
or you run for your life.

34:19.586 --> 34:21.275
So there's really no choice?

34:21.551 --> 34:22.827
We all got choices.

34:23.344 --> 34:26.034
Will you join our set?
Or you join the other.

34:26.172 --> 34:27.758
But if you do that,
you're off the count.

34:28.241 --> 34:30.758
- Off the count, meaning?
- Off for death.

34:37.965 --> 34:39.379
Nothing further.

34:45.931 --> 34:47.482
It'd be nice if we got to choose

34:47.620 --> 34:49.034
the world we were raised in.

34:49.793 --> 34:52.068
But we don't. So some children,

34:52.379 --> 34:55.413
are brought up in a world
of abuse, pain and brutality.

34:55.551 --> 34:57.482
That's the world
where Willy was raised.

34:57.758 --> 34:59.172
Yes, he joined a gang.

34:59.310 --> 35:01.206
Yes he carried a gun.

35:01.344 --> 35:02.758
Yes. He fired that gun.

35:02.896 --> 35:05.482
As a matter
of personal survival.

35:06.413 --> 35:07.724
You recall the testimony,

35:07.965 --> 35:09.482
those gang members shot at him

35:09.620 --> 35:12.655
and then they hijacked
a city bus, like ninjas.

35:12.793 --> 35:15.172
They were going
to kill this boy.

35:16.551 --> 35:18.000
This child.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.068
To some of you,
he may look like a man.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.586
He is not a man. He is a child
just like your own.

35:25.482 --> 35:26.965
He is 14 years old,

35:27.482 --> 35:29.896
and a gang
called "Thrill to Kill"

35:30.310 --> 35:31.758
was going to kill this child.

35:32.275 --> 35:33.551
And when it's them or you,

35:33.689 --> 35:36.931
gang or no gang,
that is called self defense.

35:37.724 --> 35:40.758
And it is because
Willy acted in self defense

35:41.551 --> 35:44.068
that you cannot
convict him of murder.

36:00.413 --> 36:02.103
Lack of opportunity
or lack of hope

36:02.241 --> 36:04.172
are not William Walker's fault.

36:05.206 --> 36:08.172
But, what is his fault,
what makes Mr. Walker

36:08.310 --> 36:10.206
an unrepentant
gang banger and murderer

36:10.344 --> 36:13.241
is his utter lack
of personal responsibility.

36:13.724 --> 36:15.620
He's chosen the path
of gang warfare.

36:16.172 --> 36:18.068
He was a willing soldier
in that war.

36:18.689 --> 36:20.517
But there was a real soldier

36:20.655 --> 36:22.103
who fought in a real war.

36:22.758 --> 36:25.551
The innocent bystander
the defendant shot and killed.

36:26.172 --> 36:28.517
Private First Class,
Miguel Sanchez.

36:29.068 --> 36:30.241
Home all of four months

36:30.379 --> 36:31.827
and taken away
from his young wife

36:31.965 --> 36:33.586
and their two-year-old daughter.

36:35.241 --> 36:36.655
Let us be clear.

36:37.310 --> 36:39.275
Once this man started
carrying a loaded gun,

36:39.413 --> 36:42.655
he forfeited his right to
the legal claim of self defense.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.620
It is called combat
by mutual agreement.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.482
When you agree to a duel,

36:47.620 --> 36:49.758
you do not get to say,
"He shot at me first."

36:53.241 --> 36:54.310
Tom.

36:54.724 --> 36:56.137
- Yeah.
- Do you have a minute?

36:56.862 --> 36:57.965
Sure.

36:58.827 --> 37:00.793
I don't think this is
the right place for me.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.448
I went to arraignments
with Charlie and the clients

37:03.586 --> 37:04.965
I'm not good with them.

37:05.103 --> 37:07.034
And then there's something
called horse trading

37:07.172 --> 37:08.689
but it's different
than cherry picking,

37:08.827 --> 37:10.344
and then one of the clients
got dragged to prison

37:10.482 --> 37:11.793
in front of his wife.

37:12.379 --> 37:14.620
This whole world,
I don't know.

37:14.862 --> 37:16.586
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

37:16.896 --> 37:19.103
Listen, the truth?

37:19.413 --> 37:21.310
You know it'll be really bad
if you left right now.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.896
McNamara's out on disability,

37:23.034 --> 37:24.689
Martinez is about to go
on maternity leave

37:24.827 --> 37:27.103
and I'm pretty sure Gilbert
is not long for this world.

37:27.241 --> 37:29.379
I mean frankly,
what we need is a warm body

37:29.517 --> 37:31.586
with a pulse
and a JD degree, okay?

37:38.379 --> 37:39.793
You know a Bennet Thompson?

37:40.344 --> 37:41.517
Oh my God, yes.

37:42.068 --> 37:43.517
He's going to be hanging
around here for a while.

37:43.758 --> 37:46.241
He's one of Chance the Rapper's
favorite authors.

37:47.103 --> 37:48.551
Don't quit yet.

38:12.241 --> 38:14.172
Supreme Court,
New York County,

38:14.620 --> 38:17.620
in the case of the People
vs. William James Walker,

38:17.965 --> 38:20.103
on the charge of murder
in the second degree,

38:20.275 --> 38:22.310
we, the jury find the defendant,

38:22.551 --> 38:23.551
not guilty.

38:26.689 --> 38:28.172
On the second count,

38:28.310 --> 38:30.172
criminal possession of a weapon
in the second degree,

38:30.413 --> 38:33.344
we the jury find
the defendant... guilty.

38:33.482 --> 38:34.965
Your Honor,
in light of the verdict,

38:35.103 --> 38:36.655
we would request that
this matter be transferred

38:36.793 --> 38:38.000
to juvenile court
for sentencing.

38:38.137 --> 38:39.034
Granted.

38:39.482 --> 38:40.517
What does that mean?

38:40.931 --> 38:42.482
It means that he'll be
sentenced in family court

38:42.620 --> 38:44.724
for the gun possession,
it means that we won.

38:45.827 --> 38:47.344
Oh-- Thank you!

38:48.172 --> 38:50.000
Thank you so much, Ms. Sullivan.

38:53.103 --> 38:55.172
You were doing
God's work, Ms. Sullivan.

38:55.551 --> 38:57.034
You are blessed.

39:04.206 --> 39:06.034
Hey, isn't it Tom's birthday?

39:06.344 --> 39:07.517
Wait, I thought he was a Taurus.

39:07.655 --> 39:09.448
It was most
definitely yesterday.

39:11.689 --> 39:13.379
Surprise!

39:17.000 --> 39:20.137
Thank you so much,
but my birthday is next week.

39:20.482 --> 39:22.275
You always screw it up.
It's a little sad.

39:22.482 --> 39:25.551
Some of you may
recognize our guest,

39:25.758 --> 39:27.206
writer Bennet Thompson.

39:27.344 --> 39:28.896
And he will be shadowing us
for the next few weeks

39:29.034 --> 39:30.241
for his latest project.

39:30.379 --> 39:32.206
So, try to be
in your best behavior.

39:32.344 --> 39:33.448
They're all yours.

39:33.965 --> 39:35.241
God help you.

39:35.862 --> 39:36.551
Welcome.

39:36.689 --> 39:37.689
What you drinking?

39:37.965 --> 39:39.862
- Single malt?
- Right answer.

39:43.586 --> 39:46.551
I can't tell if they're
polishing each other's knobs

39:46.689 --> 39:48.931
or sniffing each other's asses.

39:49.379 --> 39:50.551
I just can't.

39:50.758 --> 39:51.931
Thanks, I won't be able

39:52.068 --> 39:53.413
to get that visual
out of my head.

39:54.620 --> 39:55.620
Hey, you.

39:55.758 --> 39:57.482
Be a lamb
and go fill the jukebox.

39:57.620 --> 39:59.172
No boy bands or Bieber.

40:02.137 --> 40:03.620
I can't tell if he's into me.

40:04.965 --> 40:06.206
My mama used to say,

40:06.344 --> 40:08.206
a friend will
shoot you a warm glance

40:08.344 --> 40:10.241
as if to say "good to see you."

40:14.000 --> 40:16.137
But the devil take with a smile,

40:17.034 --> 40:19.724
that's like warm
biscuits in gravy, honey.

40:22.172 --> 40:25.413
Hey, hey! Make sure
you play some Blake Shelton.

40:35.758 --> 40:37.172
Next time on In Contempt.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.344
Are you out of your mind?

40:40.068 --> 40:41.413
Everybody shut up!

40:41.793 --> 40:43.310
You all remember
Bennet Thompson,

40:43.448 --> 40:45.517
he is going to shadow
Gwen's case.

40:50.862 --> 40:52.724
I have to protect the process.

40:52.862 --> 40:54.517
Even if it means
convicting an innocent man.

40:54.655 --> 40:56.482
Does anyone care about
the law around here?

40:56.620 --> 40:57.965
Call it a performance review.

40:58.103 --> 41:00.103
- She'll do great.
- Not her, you.

41:00.862 --> 41:02.965
- We're losing.
- It's not your fault.

41:03.379 --> 41:04.482
We need a rabbit.

41:04.620 --> 41:05.724
We sure do.
