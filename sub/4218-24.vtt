WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:05.046
Severide! You need
to pull her up! Pull!

00:05.214 --> 00:06.839
Previously on
Chicago Fire...

00:07.007 --> 00:08.925
I'm gonna push
to fast-track
Peter Mills to Squad.

00:09.093 --> 00:10.093
Why's it so
important to you?

00:10.260 --> 00:12.053
'Cause I want to be
an elite firefighter, sir.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.889
And this has got nothing
to do with your father?
This is about me.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.099
Can we talk?

00:16.725 --> 00:19.852
Boden and my mom?
And you knew about
this how long?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.396
I wish you would have
told me when you found out.

00:21.563 --> 00:24.607
It wasn't my business.
It was your business.
I was your boyfriend.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.859
Was?
I think I
need some time.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.530
Stabilize that car
so you can get that woman out.

00:30.698 --> 00:31.948
Ma'am, you need
to remain still.

00:32.574 --> 00:35.785
I've been dating
a Japanese woman.
We haven't actually met yet.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.578
An Internet girlfriend?

00:37.746 --> 00:40.206
Part of me feels horrible
because of what Casey's
going through.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.791
Here I am with butterflies
in my stomach

00:41.959 --> 00:43.751
because I'm getting
ready to go get pregnant...

00:45.838 --> 00:47.213
Hallie!

00:51.760 --> 00:53.469
Let me
ask you something.

00:53.637 --> 00:56.389
What kind of equipment
do you use for your podcast?

00:56.557 --> 00:59.475
Oh, the podcast you call
"Dummy Vision"?
Now you're interested?

01:00.811 --> 01:03.187
All right, listen.
The baby's due in
a couple of weeks,

01:03.355 --> 01:07.734
and Cindy, she wants me
to set up a video journal
or something.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.610
You got a video camera
I can use?

01:09.778 --> 01:12.029
Herrmann, you got
a high-def camera
on your phone.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.532
Why don't you just
take some footage?
I'll edit it for you.

01:14.700 --> 01:18.619
Ah...
Thank you, Otis.
Yeah. All right.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.833
Ladies' night specials?
You're kidding me.

01:24.001 --> 01:27.837
See? I told you she'd
be pissed. You know why?
'Cause it's sexist!

01:28.005 --> 01:32.925
Yeah, sexist against men!
It just feels
a little desperate.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.100
Oh, look at
the new shop!

01:43.645 --> 01:45.813
Great. Great!
Now there's going to be
construction traffic

01:45.981 --> 01:47.648
that's going to
clog up the block?

01:47.816 --> 01:51.444
Hey, easy, negative Nancy.
This is gonna be good for us.

01:51.862 --> 01:55.990
You know, it's probably going
to be a bunch of new condos,
or nature food places.

01:56.158 --> 02:02.538
I told you guys,
the neighborhood,
it's up and coming. Yup.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.792
You're messing
with me.
No! Women love it.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.836
You would not
believe how many
nerve endings are...

02:10.631 --> 02:11.923
Morning, Lieutenant.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.092
Don't stop with
the sex advice
on my account.

02:18.347 --> 02:23.810
How you doing?
You know, just taking it
day by day.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.909
Lieutenant...

02:40.786 --> 02:42.411
I'm fine, really.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.335
If there's anything
I can do...

02:52.589 --> 02:54.298
Thanks, man.

03:01.223 --> 03:04.100
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

03:05.477 --> 03:10.064
Leslie Shay. Did you get your
blood drawn this morning?
Yeah.

03:10.232 --> 03:14.068
Yeah? Where are you
in your cycle?
Um, I'm a day late.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.865
I didn't want to take
a home test, 'cause
they're not 100%,

03:19.032 --> 03:21.784
so Kelly and I went to the
doctor and they're gonna call
us later with the results.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.871
Oh, my God.
I get to throw the
baby shower, right?

03:25.038 --> 03:27.582
Don't jinx this!
It's too soon to be
talking about that stuff.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.631
You and Mills
ignoring each other?
Uh, not completely. I mean,

03:35.799 --> 03:39.343
we pass each other in the
halls and say "Good morning,"
"See you later."

03:39.511 --> 03:42.138
You were trying to
protect him. He's crazy if
he can't forgive you.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.516
Well, you've got to be
able to trust the person
you're with, right?

03:46.518 --> 03:48.019
And if you can't...

03:52.107 --> 03:55.109
Mills!
Wanted to give you
a heads-up.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.654
Boden got word squad
decisions are
being made today.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.531
This could be your
last shift on truck.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.245
Hey, Severide, I got
something for ya.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.164
What the hell
is this?

04:08.332 --> 04:09.874
It's a pregnancy
pillow.

04:10.042 --> 04:13.878
Cindy used it up until the
seventh month. It helps with
back issues and whatnot.

04:14.046 --> 04:17.673
You give that to Shay
when the time comes,
and you will be her hero.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.800
Okay. Thanks.

04:19.968 --> 04:25.514
All right. Hey, having
a kid is the best
thing you'll ever do.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.976
Yeah, that's what I hear.

04:29.144 --> 04:33.272
Squad 3,
Truck 81, Engine 51,
Ambulance 61, Battalion 25.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.109
Structure fire,
3015 South California Avenue.

04:46.078 --> 04:49.997
Don't worry, Mills.
These kind of calls usually
aren't too serious.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.083
What kind of calls?

05:04.388 --> 05:06.639
- Up against the curb!
- You in charge?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.850
Facility director,
Rick Esposito.
Okay, what are we looking at?

05:10.018 --> 05:13.521
We got smoke in Pod Four,
a dorm area we set up for
overcrowding.

05:13.689 --> 05:16.190
Are you evacuating?
Well, I pulled most
of my staff out,

05:16.358 --> 05:17.775
but I think it's best
we don't move the inmates.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.777
We have vents that'll
draw away the smoke.

05:19.945 --> 05:23.239
Have the sprinklers turned on?
Inmates were turning
them on to cause trouble,

05:23.407 --> 05:27.118
so I had 'em deactivated.
Will you turn them back on
now, please? Right now.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.787
Find Roy. Tell him to
turn the sprinklers back on.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.081
Casey, build a small team
together to go inside.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.959
Severide, I want
Squad standing by for
RIT rescue.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.546
RIT Rescue?
Rapid intervention team.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.298
All right.
Cruz, Herrmann, Mills...
leave your irons.

05:41.466 --> 05:45.094
Bring your pry ax, pike pole,
two silver bullets, a
one-and-three-quarter hose.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.311
Back off!
Come on, follow me.

05:54.813 --> 05:55.730
What the hell
you looking at?

05:55.897 --> 05:58.733
Mills, keep your eyes open
and your back to the wall.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.736
And don't take any lip
from anybody. Got it?

06:14.541 --> 06:19.295
I wanted to thank you for
not spilling the beans about
my ladyfriend in Japan.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.632
Your steamy online
affair's still going?
As a matter of fact,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.969
Mari lands at O'Hare
tomorrow. We're finally
going to meet.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.847
Mary? That doesn't sound
very Japanese.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.557
M-A-R-I.

06:32.017 --> 06:35.478
Now, did "Mary" ask you
to carry anything back
to Japan for her?

06:35.645 --> 06:38.689
Or, you know, make
deliveries of any kind
here in the States?

06:40.567 --> 06:44.195
Right. Understand.
I'll let Herrmann know.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.033
Christopher Herrmann,
can you read me?
What's up, Chief?

06:49.201 --> 06:52.912
Cindy just went into labor.
Her folks are bringing
her to Lakeshore right now.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.041
How 'bout that? For once in
her life, a woman's early.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.918
I'm sending someone in
to come get you right now.

06:59.086 --> 07:03.089
Nah. That'll take too long
and we're almost there.
I can smell the smoke.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.092
Master Control,
what do you see
in Pod Four overflow?

07:06.259 --> 07:10.262
Can't see
anything, too much smoke.
Let's go, let's go.

07:16.394 --> 07:20.022
We gotta get into Pod Four
overflow now!
Copy that.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.068
Mills, locate a standpipe.
Yeah.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.363
What happened to
the exhaust unit?
I don't know.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.865
Get back! On the floor!

07:31.368 --> 07:36.122
All right! Get down!
Back up! Get low, and let
these guys work! On the floor!

07:40.919 --> 07:42.336
We've gotta get these
guys out of here!

07:42.504 --> 07:45.714
I got to clear that
through Master Control!
Then clear it!

07:45.882 --> 07:49.260
Man down! Man down!
Lieutenant,
this guy's hurt!

07:56.977 --> 07:57.935
I said back off!

07:58.103 --> 08:00.855
We gotta get this guy out.
We can't wait for permission!

08:01.314 --> 08:03.107
Okay,
who started the fire?

08:03.275 --> 08:05.484
This is Lucci again.
We're coming out
with an injured guy!

08:05.652 --> 08:07.361
Cruz, clear off that vent!

08:08.280 --> 08:09.113
Got it! Herrmann!

08:23.086 --> 08:24.211
He's all yours, candidate!

08:25.130 --> 08:30.009
Hey, I need your help, man.
We got to put pressure on his
wounds. Hey, I need your help!

08:30.177 --> 08:31.927
Put pressure on these!
Come on!

08:36.057 --> 08:38.058
Stay down, stay down,
all right?

08:39.144 --> 08:41.228
Chief, we got a victim in here
with multiple stab wounds.

08:41.646 --> 08:45.107
Mills, can you transport
the victim out?
No, negative, Chief!

08:45.275 --> 08:47.318
Bleeding's too heavy.
Hang tight, Mills.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.944
Shay and Dawson are
on their way in to you.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.781
I'll grab the bag,
you grab the chair.
Okay.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.162
Stay down, buddy.
Keep holding him.

09:03.627 --> 09:07.129
Hey, what's wrong
with you, huh?
You want to die?

09:07.964 --> 09:10.466
Knock it off!
Where the hell's Lucci?

09:10.634 --> 09:12.593
We're going to get you
to a hospital, okay?
Hang in there.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.304
Hey, what's your name?
What's your name?
Bite me.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.472
His name's Randall.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.477
Get the flames out!

09:22.479 --> 09:24.897
- I'm out!
- Yeah, me too!

09:27.984 --> 09:29.818
- Stay back.
- Get going!

09:31.696 --> 09:33.614
Lucci,
where you at?
Up here!

09:36.952 --> 09:39.328
Hey there, you got a name?

09:39.496 --> 09:42.957
Yeah. It's Randall.
What's yours, sweetheart?

09:43.124 --> 09:44.458
Now you change
your tune, right?

09:45.627 --> 09:47.878
Ah. Okay.

09:48.463 --> 09:52.716
We got stab wounds
to the thorax, left flank,
left, right abdomen.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.760
Right. Get me gauze. Lots.
Yep.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.637
Hey, I got to get back in
there to my lieutenant, man.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.347
Fojas, you got this?
Yeah.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.225
Open up Pod Four.
Give us a
few seconds, Lucci. Stand by.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.852
All right.
This is going to hurt.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.773
What's going
to hurt, baby?

10:07.941 --> 10:11.110
- You don't feel this?
- No.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.864
How's your back feel, Randall?
Did you take a fall during
that scuffle?

10:16.032 --> 10:18.284
Forget the stair chair.
He's not going anywhere
without a backboard.

10:18.451 --> 10:22.204
Okay. I got to get out.
I can't leave her
alone with him.

10:24.499 --> 10:28.460
Mills, stick with Dawson.
Let's go.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.354
Okay, we're done. Let's go.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.939
Amen to that.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.175
Oh, this ain't good.

11:24.893 --> 11:29.271
Hey guys, what's going on with
the power here? We'd really
like to get out of here now.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.981
We have
no way to open that door.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.777
I advise you let yourself
into the pod and wait
for a power reset.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.738
This way.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.532
Deeper into this hellhole?

11:42.327 --> 11:43.994
Okay, let's go.
All right, it's going
to be a minute, now.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.621
We got a power outage,
Shay, stand by.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.998
Dawson and Mills are alone
in there, Chief. We got to
get back inside.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.085
You can't. The perimeter
doors failsafe to
a locked position.

11:51.836 --> 11:52.920
Don't you have
a backup generator?

11:53.088 --> 11:55.130
It's not a problem with
the grid. The system just
shut itself down.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.465
It will reset soon.
Hold tight.

11:57.926 --> 12:01.845
Get me the blueprints
to this prison. We need to
find a way out for my guys.

12:14.776 --> 12:18.070
Okay, this is creepy as hell.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.407
All right, Lucci can move
about within the pod,

12:21.574 --> 12:24.701
but every point of exit
is remotely operated,
which requires power.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.745
Is anyone trying to get
the power back?

12:26.913 --> 12:29.665
Well, Roy, my facilities guy,
he went down to the basement

12:29.833 --> 12:31.375
to deal with the sprinklers
and now he's trapped.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.585
We're trying to reach
our other guy, but
he's off-site today.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.797
Do you have an emergency plan
to get my firefighters
out of there?

12:36.965 --> 12:40.884
My emergency response team
is ready to go, but until
the power's back up...

12:44.639 --> 12:45.597
Hello?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.813
Lovely
clientele you have here.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.982
Yeah, smoke up the place
just to conceal a shivving.

12:55.150 --> 12:59.069
They did it by tampering
with an outlet. Must be what
overloaded the system.

12:59.237 --> 13:03.574
Don't worry,
it'll reset itself.
Any minute now.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.827
Hey, Chief, this is Mills.
Any idea how much longer
this is going to be?

13:06.995 --> 13:08.412
Our victim is bleeding
out in here.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.498
Just do what you can for him,
Mills. We'll get you out
as soon as we possibly can.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.042
We are not waiting anymore.
Do what you got
to do, Chief.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.003
Get them out, Lieutenant.
Yup.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.846
Was that the doctor?
Yeah. It didn't take.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.683
Damn.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.029
It's official.
We're trapped until
further notice.

13:42.197 --> 13:42.863
Nice.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.825
Hey, hey! Easy, player.
You want me to finish
what those guys started?

13:47.994 --> 13:51.205
Hey, Randall.
Randall, you
with me? Hey!

13:56.669 --> 13:57.669
That sound.

14:01.132 --> 14:05.052
Yeah, that's stridor.
He's got a hematoma
pressing on his trachea.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.970
We need to intubate.
All right.

14:11.935 --> 14:18.524
Come on! No, he's fighting me.
Um, we gotta do a
nasotracheal intubation.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.318
Get me a size seven ET tube.

14:25.490 --> 14:29.117
Have you done this before?
In the OR room,
in training.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.038
Okay, hold his head back
for me, do not let him move

14:33.206 --> 14:35.040
and keep that flashlight
on his face.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.379
Come on...

14:45.760 --> 14:48.470
Boy, they don't make
this easy, do they?
That's kind of the idea.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.889
Well, the bolt's pretty hard
to get to. I'm gonna take
the hinges instead.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.599
Shield.

15:02.193 --> 15:04.319
Chief, you got any
updates on Cindy?

15:04.487 --> 15:05.487
Shay.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.450
Shay's going to call
the hospital right now.
Hang on in there, Herrmann.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.494
Thanks, Chief.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.916
Hello. Can I get
an update on Cindy Herrmann
up in Maternity?

15:20.712 --> 15:23.171
Hey, guys? Close that door?

15:24.173 --> 15:25.924
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, what the hell is this?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.927
We'll check upstairs.
Come on, move back. What are
you guys doing out here?

15:29.095 --> 15:31.555
We were getting
smoked out. Corbett
opened the cells.

15:31.723 --> 15:34.308
So where's Corbett?
He just opened up
your cells and left?

15:37.645 --> 15:40.897
Corbett, where are you, buddy?
You got a little bit of
explaining to do.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.696
There's
smoke here, too.

15:48.281 --> 15:52.909
Chief, we got a second fire
smoldering somewhere
in the HVAC system.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.455
Probably an electrical
fire caused by the inmates
tampering with the outlet.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.584
Copy that, 81. See if
you can locate that fire.

16:01.336 --> 16:04.046
Severide, you
making any progress?

16:04.213 --> 16:07.591
Hey, Chief, just finishing
the first door now, but we're
going through a lot of blades.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.347
Security studs?
You watched me cut
through all these hinges

16:13.514 --> 16:15.849
and you didn't tell me that
they got security studs?

16:16.017 --> 16:17.184
I didn't build the place.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.813
Hey, Capp, prep the torch.
We've got to cut through
this bolt after all.

16:21.981 --> 16:22.981
All right, you got it.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.321
Is it in?
Ah, I think so.

16:31.366 --> 16:34.534
Attach the ambu bag,
give me a few breaths.
Here.

16:37.372 --> 16:42.459
I can't...
I don't know, I can't tell if
it's in the trachea or not,

16:42.627 --> 16:45.379
I hear breathing sounds
everywhere. I gotta get
in there to see.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.010
Yeah, that might work.
Hold that steady.
Uh-huh.

16:54.430 --> 16:57.224
Okay hand me that stylet.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.200
If the tube's in the right
place, we'll see the light
shining through his skin.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.584
Oh, Gabby, Gabby!
It's in!

17:27.714 --> 17:29.423
Oh, my God.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.140
Chief, if the fire is
electrical it might be keeping
the power from resetting.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.600
We should try shutting
down the cell block circuit.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.853
Got it.
Keep looking
for that fire.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.981
If it gets out
of control, we will
not be able to evacuate.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.735
Hey, Chief.
Any news about Cindy?

17:51.779 --> 17:52.779
Stand by, Herrmann.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.950
The baby is in distress.
They have to do an
emergency C-section.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.123
No news yet, Christopher.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.964
Esposito, where's
your substation?

18:12.175 --> 18:13.967
ComEd should have
someone over here
in about 40 minutes.

18:14.135 --> 18:17.387
But if you want to give it
a shot, the substation and
and switchgear box

18:17.555 --> 18:18.847
are on the east side.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.056
Go.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.690
Don't worry, Herrmann,
we'll get out of here.

18:31.027 --> 18:34.946
Hey, Lucci, is this some kind
of maintenance access?
Yeah.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.323
Thanks.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.829
Whoa!

18:51.255 --> 18:55.801
This guy's cold.
Chief, we got a real
bad situation here.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.596
We've got an officer down.
Looks like his throat's
been cut.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.641
He's dead. Bled out.

19:09.899 --> 19:10.899
Corbett!

19:21.327 --> 19:26.581
Where are his keys? Hey!
Hey! They got his keys!

19:29.210 --> 19:30.210
Hey!

19:33.840 --> 19:38.009
Holy cow.
What happened to the
old-fashioned fuse box?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.136
Do you remember the power
outage at the Superbowl?

19:40.847 --> 19:44.224
We're the guys everyone's
waiting on to fix it.
Great, no pressure.

19:46.269 --> 19:50.522
Hey! Who did it, huh?
Which one of you
scumbags did it?

19:50.690 --> 19:53.191
On the floor!
On the floor, now!

19:56.237 --> 19:58.905
Get down!
On the floor, now!

19:59.407 --> 20:00.907
Everybody! Let's go!

20:10.251 --> 20:11.793
Got it?
I got it!

20:16.799 --> 20:19.050
Hey, Chief, we're through
the first door, maybe
we should turn back

20:19.218 --> 20:20.385
and start cutting our
way to Casey.

20:20.803 --> 20:24.764
Negative. That would take
too long. You keep going.
Find Mills and Dawson.

20:24.932 --> 20:25.932
Copy.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.941
This whole thing
with Boden and your mom...

20:37.904 --> 20:43.241
I messed up, but
I had good intentions.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.621
I appreciate that.

20:49.624 --> 20:54.252
So maybe we put it
past us and start over?

20:56.130 --> 20:58.924
Day one,
clean slate,
right here?

21:03.054 --> 21:04.220
You want a clean slate?

21:06.766 --> 21:10.602
You just tell me, honestly,
that you don't have
feelings for Casey.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.902
You tell me that,
and this right here
becomes day one.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.450
Dawson, Mills,
you in there?

21:39.757 --> 21:42.258
You! Acevedo!
You did it?
No! No, man!

21:42.426 --> 21:44.594
Then tell me who did,
or you're going down!

21:44.762 --> 21:45.971
You're all going
down for this!

21:46.138 --> 21:47.973
Everybody
just take it easy.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.017
On the floor!

21:53.813 --> 21:55.897
Whoa, whoa, hey!
Nobody move.
Nobody move.

22:04.865 --> 22:05.907
Back off!
You understand me?

22:06.075 --> 22:08.785
You're going down,
Rios. Hard!

22:08.953 --> 22:10.745
Everybody just
take it easy.

22:10.913 --> 22:14.708
You think you're going to get
away with this 'cause the
cameras are down? No way!

22:14.875 --> 22:17.752
Back off! And you,
get us out of this smoke.

22:19.714 --> 22:26.136
Hey. Lucci. Here's what we do.
Is there some place we can
move these guys?

22:27.096 --> 22:28.930
You want to move
these lowlifes?

22:29.098 --> 22:31.891
Yeah, let's get out of the
smoke, give them some place
they can calm down a bit.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.020
Lucci!

22:35.187 --> 22:39.691
Okay.
We can move them
to the chapel.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.152
All right.

22:45.322 --> 22:48.283
Everybody
just take it easy.
All right!

22:49.660 --> 22:51.494
We're heading
to the to the chapel.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.830
One of the inmates has a knife
to Herrmann's throat.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.542
You tell them we have a
hostage situation and they
have got one of my men!

22:57.710 --> 23:00.420
Their guy's still
a half hour away.
We don't have half an hour!

23:01.130 --> 23:04.007
Now, there has got to be
somebody at ComEd who can talk
us through this procedure.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.092
They're not familiar
with our setup.

23:17.438 --> 23:18.855
He's barely hanging on.

23:26.197 --> 23:28.073
Chief, victim's on
his way out to you.

23:29.575 --> 23:33.328
Thank you, Severide.
Now you get to the basement
and the quicker, the better.

23:34.163 --> 23:37.540
'Cause apparently, this
facilities guy is the only one
who can get the power back up.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.799
Come on.

23:50.721 --> 23:54.349
Okay? Smoke's not
so bad in here.

23:54.517 --> 23:59.104
Let's talk. Now.
Now let my man go.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.064
Uh-uh.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.695
Rios.

24:10.032 --> 24:13.493
My guy there, he's got
a baby on the way.

24:13.661 --> 24:18.414
He's got four more kids
at home. Let him go.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.675
Fine. You want a hostage?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.307
I'll be your hostage.
Casey, don't.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.018
But you let my man go.
Don't.

24:39.854 --> 24:43.815
I don't want you.
Then what do you want? Huh?

24:44.900 --> 24:46.234
I want him.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.450
I'm going down, might as
well finish what I started.

25:01.667 --> 25:05.503
I am not handing someone
over so you can kill them.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.131
Then you ain't getting
your man back.

25:24.773 --> 25:29.319
Hey, yo, mister fireman!
You want to trade or what?

25:33.240 --> 25:34.532
Huh?

25:38.746 --> 25:41.831
How do you reason
with these guys?
Reason with them?

25:42.333 --> 25:45.460
They're animals, they just
don't like their zookeeper.

25:48.923 --> 25:50.882
Do not leave
his side, Fojas.

26:04.355 --> 26:05.939
Gabby.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.111
I can't tell you
what you need to hear.
It wouldn't be the truth.

26:15.366 --> 26:16.866
I'm sorry.

26:39.765 --> 26:44.352
Hello? Roy?
Anybody down here?

26:44.520 --> 26:47.021
Over here!

26:47.189 --> 26:50.900
Down here! I'm trapped! Help!
Hey, Chief, we
found facilities Roy.

26:51.902 --> 26:54.237
Good news.
Get his ass out here.

26:58.158 --> 27:01.869
We're out of cutting rods.
Damn it.

27:02.413 --> 27:05.957
Hey, can you talk
someone through resetting
the electrical system?

27:06.667 --> 27:07.875
That's against union rules.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.254
There's a firefighter
being held hostage. I think
they'll give you a pass.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.882
Chief, he's going
to relay instructions.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.219
Mouch, Otis, you listening?

27:18.387 --> 27:19.679
Yeah, we're ready.

27:21.849 --> 27:25.143
Uh, first, uh, look at
the indicator panel on
the switchgear.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.146
Make sure that it's green.
That means it's ready
for operation.

27:29.315 --> 27:34.277
Okay, look at the indicator
on the switchgear panel
and make sure that it's green.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.279
And then it's
ready for operation.

27:36.447 --> 27:39.699
Looking for an indicator.
You see a green indicator?
Is that it? Where is it?

27:39.867 --> 27:41.784
Right here! Right here!

27:43.078 --> 27:44.954
Okay, got it. Go ahead.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.582
Got the report,
is the airway secure?

27:47.750 --> 27:49.125
Think so. Sats are 100%.

27:50.336 --> 27:53.338
Nasotracheal intubation.
Get him to room one.

27:55.716 --> 27:59.677
Excuse me, I need the status
of a patient up in maternity.
Cindy Herrmann.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.347
Casey.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.725
The power reset's going to
take a minute, but Otis and
Mouch have their instructions.

28:05.893 --> 28:06.893
Thanks.

28:11.648 --> 28:14.901
Hey, Severide, if you're
still in the basement,

28:15.069 --> 28:17.987
see if you can locate
the supply duct for Pod Four.

28:18.155 --> 28:20.156
You got it.

28:23.410 --> 28:26.829
Yo, what are you talking
to him about, huh? Huh?

28:27.664 --> 28:29.916
We still have a fire burning
in the vent system somewhere.

28:30.084 --> 28:33.336
I'm trying to put it out
before the smoke kills all
of us! What do you think?

28:33.504 --> 28:34.462
Casey...

28:34.630 --> 28:36.089
Can Herrmann hear me?

28:40.469 --> 28:42.512
Yeah, what's up, Chief?

28:42.679 --> 28:44.305
Go ahead, Shay.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.936
Christopher.
They performed an emergency
C-section on Cindy.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.438
It's a baby boy.

29:00.489 --> 29:03.366
There were some complications.
The baby's in ICU.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.410
Back up! I don't care
about no damn baby!

29:05.577 --> 29:08.454
Are they okay?
Is everyone okay?

29:09.373 --> 29:10.665
I'm trying
to get more details.

29:10.833 --> 29:11.833
Back away!

29:14.795 --> 29:16.003
Hold them off!

29:17.923 --> 29:18.923
Come on! In here!

29:26.473 --> 29:28.099
Lucci, you ain't coming
out of here alive!

29:29.101 --> 29:31.561
Severide! Did you find
that supply duct?

29:36.817 --> 29:40.069
Yeah, good call, Casey.
We got the fire, we're
putting it out now.

29:40.821 --> 29:44.198
No, not yet! We need
the smoke. There should
be a smoke damper.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.617
It should have closed when
the fire alarms went off.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.369
You, Lucci! I'll kill you!

29:51.832 --> 29:55.209
Smoke damper!
Severide! Right there!

29:56.628 --> 29:59.839
We got it!
Okay, break the linkage on the
damper and open it manually.

30:00.007 --> 30:04.093
Hurry! Otis, Mouch! Get that
power up! We need the fan
to start blowing!

30:10.559 --> 30:11.642
Damper's open!

30:11.810 --> 30:14.854
Otis, Mouch!
Where's the power?

30:15.606 --> 30:19.066
Uh, it's coming up,
uh, momentarily.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.915
All right!
The fan is going, Casey!

30:34.082 --> 30:36.542
Power's back up.
Get my men out.
Go!

30:55.812 --> 31:02.026
Rios! Rios!
Let me and my firefighters go!
You can have Lucci.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.988
We're not dying for him!
Just let us go!
Deal.

31:24.258 --> 31:25.758
Come on out, Lucci!

31:48.031 --> 31:49.031
Thank you.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.371
Herrmann,
it's the hospital.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.873
Yeah, this is
Christopher Herrmann.
What's happening?

31:58.041 --> 32:03.879
Uh-huh? Okay, yeah.
Got it, I'm on my way,
I'll be right there.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.592
They said the baby's not
getting enough oxygen.
Get him out of here!

32:35.245 --> 32:38.539
My wife, Cindy Herrmann,
and my baby boy?

32:38.707 --> 32:40.875
310. But sir!

32:51.303 --> 32:54.722
Christopher.
Cindy.

32:57.100 --> 33:01.062
What... What
happened, honey?

33:12.157 --> 33:13.157
Oh.

33:14.034 --> 33:15.534
Say hello to your son!

33:15.702 --> 33:17.453
Oh, man.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.001
Hey! Oh!

33:29.591 --> 33:33.094
Look at him.
He's beautiful.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.769
We got a real good
one here, huh?

33:53.657 --> 33:55.449
- Hey, Pops.
- Isn't he cute?

33:55.617 --> 33:58.160
Hey!
Oh, my God.

33:58.328 --> 33:59.912
Look at this boy.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.792
What do
you think, Chief?

34:06.545 --> 34:08.003
Fantastic.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.049
Boden.

34:14.636 --> 34:18.723
Herrmann, this kid's
the cutest thing I've
ever seen. He's so perfect.

34:18.890 --> 34:22.268
Even with that
W.C. Fields face?
Who's that?

34:24.688 --> 34:27.648
Mills?
Can I talk to you?

34:34.281 --> 34:35.865
I just got a call
from the higher-ups.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.078
Unfortunately, you
did not make Squad
this time around.

34:45.083 --> 34:48.169
These things are political.
New names float to
the top of the list.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.963
This is not a reflection
on you, or your hard work.

34:56.303 --> 35:00.389
I have seen men brood,
lose focus when they
didn't make it into Squad.

35:00.807 --> 35:03.058
I'm hoping that you
can rise above all that.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.519
You keep working hard,
you keep up with the latest
training methods,

35:05.687 --> 35:09.064
and I am sure your chance
is going to come back around.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.402
It's good to hear.

35:17.908 --> 35:19.158
So, anything else?

35:21.036 --> 35:24.079
No. That's all.

35:31.171 --> 35:32.922
You got something
you want to say?

35:40.055 --> 35:41.096
No.

35:51.024 --> 35:53.067
I'm going
to take him back to
the room, all right?

35:54.486 --> 35:55.986
Oh, hey, hey, hey!
You guys?

35:57.197 --> 35:59.448
Cindy wants to see you
for a minute, okay?

36:05.121 --> 36:06.247
Hey there.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.749
Come here, you guys.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.213
Congrats.
Thank you.

36:14.381 --> 36:15.965
Knock it off.

36:18.927 --> 36:22.263
So, Cindy and I wanted
to know if you, well...

36:23.932 --> 36:25.683
We were hoping that...

36:25.851 --> 36:27.643
We want you to be
Kenny's godparents.

36:30.272 --> 36:33.816
You don't have
to answer right now.
I'd be honored!

36:33.984 --> 36:36.026
Yeah. Hell yeah, man.
Me, too.
Thank you.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.659
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.203
Thank you.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.039
Yeah.

36:53.044 --> 36:53.961
What the hell?

36:54.129 --> 36:56.797
Is your finger
blocking that circle
on top?

36:56.965 --> 36:58.257
'Cause that's
the camera, honey...

36:58.425 --> 37:00.092
Cindy, I know that.

37:01.761 --> 37:04.430
Oh. Oops.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.807
Your ma's kind of
a control freak.

37:06.975 --> 37:07.975
Christopher!

37:10.979 --> 37:14.356
But you'll learn quick.
We do whatever
the lady says, so

37:15.025 --> 37:20.654
she wants me to impart some
wisdom to you to start you off
right, and so here we go.

37:23.575 --> 37:27.161
Day one. Little Kenny
James Herrmann.

37:30.165 --> 37:34.919
It was kind of
a rough one, at least
until you came along.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.219
You've got to
be kidding me.

37:50.435 --> 37:53.145
A bunch of us
took some whacks today,

37:53.313 --> 37:55.189
but that's the way
it goes sometimes.

37:55.357 --> 37:56.690
You might as well
hear it now.

38:08.495 --> 38:10.079
I'd like an
application, please.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.840
You came along and you
made a lot of people
really happy.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.051
Not just your old man.

38:54.457 --> 38:55.791
Konnichiwa.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.094
You're a lucky guy.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.056
You were born into
a really big family.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.893
A lot of people are
going to have your back,
no matter what.

39:36.666 --> 39:47.134
Casey?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.736
Nothing...

40:08.531 --> 40:10.157
It doesn't make sense.

40:29.803 --> 40:31.303
I know.

40:40.897 --> 40:45.651
Like I said,
it's not going to be all
sunshine and roses...

40:47.862 --> 40:51.240
But I can promise
it's going to be
a hell of a ride.

40:51.908 --> 40:53.408
You okay?
Mmm-hmm.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.119
You sure?
Yeah.

40:57.413 --> 40:58.539
Renee.

40:59.165 --> 41:00.332
Hi.

41:01.584 --> 41:05.212
I didn't...
I didn't know that
you'd be in town.

41:07.674 --> 41:12.094
Well, I just wanted
to tell you in person.
