WEBVTT

01:23.250 --> 01:25.211
You’re going to be
looking at the rain

01:25.294 --> 01:29.131
hitting ground midnight tonight,
moving in from the coast.

01:29.215 --> 01:30.925
-Morning, Mark.
-Morning, Mark.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.177
-Loser.
-Loser.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.305
MARK:
Daiquirí.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.015
It’s a village in Cuba.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.975
-It’s got three I’s in it.
-DANIEL: Oh.

01:40.059 --> 01:42.895
-And toast.
-Huh.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.730
Mark, can you, uh...

01:46.023 --> 01:47.066
Oh.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.992
-You know that’s not
real food, right? -I know.

01:57.076 --> 01:59.078
-Mark, eat something healthy.
-To be fair,

01:59.161 --> 02:00.996
Dad, you’re gonna be eating
an entire pint

02:01.080 --> 02:04.667
of Chubby Hubby by yourself
in approximately eight hours.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.379
You know you have math class
today, right, Mark?

02:08.462 --> 02:12.299
What I know, Dad, is that
the capital of Burkina Faso

02:12.383 --> 02:13.884
is Ouagadougou.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.594
-Is that...?

02:15.678 --> 02:17.847
-O-U-A-G-A-D...
-Hang on, hang on.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.139
-O-U...
-O-U...

02:19.223 --> 02:21.725
-You are such a loser.
-You are such a loser.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.644
-I am not. You...
-I... You are.

02:23.727 --> 02:24.937
-I’m not.
-I’m not.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.105
You’ll be at Emma’s
soccer game, right?

02:26.188 --> 02:28.440
I’m sorry,
but that is incorrect.

02:45.332 --> 02:48.043
-

02:48.127 --> 02:51.505
had me hypnotized

02:59.805 --> 03:01.432
-Hey!

03:07.104 --> 03:08.272
-

03:14.820 --> 03:17.990
to get the hint

03:18.073 --> 03:21.243
I’m losing my grip

03:24.288 --> 03:26.373
-No, texter. Let it go.
-Uh...

03:36.467 --> 03:38.302
Uh, the keys are in your bag.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.720
Oh.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.096
Bless you.

03:48.187 --> 03:51.607
trust myself

03:54.526 --> 03:56.695
-

03:56.779 --> 03:59.990
why I’m not it

04:00.074 --> 04:03.494
I’m losing my grip

04:08.499 --> 04:11.043
It’s, uh, straight down
that way,

04:11.126 --> 04:13.128
and then it’s kind of
one of these things,

04:13.212 --> 04:14.922
-and then it’s your first right.
-

04:15.005 --> 04:17.132
-But wait.
-I got kind of a Sherlock thing.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.176
-I love that show.
-"The game is afoot!"

04:19.259 --> 04:21.470
-"Game is afoot."

04:21.553 --> 04:24.098
Why would you say that?

05:14.940 --> 05:17.276
-

05:24.158 --> 05:25.200
MAN
Let’s take one more look

05:25.284 --> 05:26.201
at your winning numbers today:

05:26.285 --> 05:28.537
42, 10, 25, 76...

05:28.620 --> 05:30.622
MARK:
Oh, my God. I-I won.

05:30.706 --> 05:31.707
I just won!

05:31.790 --> 05:33.167
I won the lottery.
Oh, my God!

05:33.250 --> 05:35.127
-MAN: Yeah!

05:54.396 --> 05:56.315
-

05:56.398 --> 05:57.274
Sorry.

05:58.942 --> 05:59.902
Are you okay?

05:59.985 --> 06:01.361
Thank you.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.698
You’re the Sherlock guy.

06:04.782 --> 06:07.743
Did I give you directions
earlier?

06:07.826 --> 06:10.037
...like, the sun is 400 times
bigger than the moon,

06:10.120 --> 06:12.456
but it’s also 400 times
farther away,

06:12.539 --> 06:14.416
so they look like
they’re the same size,

06:14.500 --> 06:15.793
-but they’re not.
-Mm.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.544
-Um... -And that is why
we have eclipses.

06:17.628 --> 06:18.712
This is me.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.589
Well, would you want
to hang out later?

06:20.672 --> 06:22.299
Tonight or something?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.468
Uh, I’ve got something.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.346
Oh. Uh, thank you.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.430
Uh...

06:28.514 --> 06:30.057
For your time.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.772
-Bye.
-Bye.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.419
Hey, man.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.004
Hey.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.422
-Oh.
-

07:03.507 --> 07:04.842
MARK:
Dude, those guys have armor.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.218
-You got to use the
rocket launcher. -Yeah. No way.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.928
-Shotgun. Watch. Ooh!
-Here.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.389
-You’re not John Wick. -Just a
little bit of sniper rifle.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.682
-Your projectile’s only gonna
make it worse. -No, no, no!

07:11.765 --> 07:12.975
Not in the face.
Not in the face. No, no.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.185
Not in the face.
Not in the face. No, no...

07:17.271 --> 07:19.481
-

07:19.565 --> 07:21.275
MARK:
He got you in the face.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.861
Yeah, I know, Mark,
he got me in the face.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.029
I’m never gonna find that key.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.823
What if your whole life
was like that?

07:27.906 --> 07:29.032
What, where you die and respawn?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.659
MARK:
Yeah.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.995
Or, like, you go to bed,
and when you wake up,

07:33.078 --> 07:36.373
it’s the same day all over
again, just on repeat.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.791
What would you do?

07:37.875 --> 07:40.169
-Besides this?
-Or in addition.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.212
You know?
Switch it up a little.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.256
Wait, wasn’t that a movie
where Bill Murray’s stuck

07:44.339 --> 07:46.675
in the same day till he has sex
with his hot boss?

07:46.758 --> 07:48.093
Groundhog Day.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.595
Then that’s it right there.

07:49.678 --> 07:50.596
Girls.

07:50.679 --> 07:51.889
You wouldn’t-- I don’t know--

07:51.972 --> 07:53.056
tie a bunch of balloons

07:53.140 --> 07:54.725
to a lawn chair or something?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.935
HENRY: Dude, no.
I’d definitely take the girl.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.021
-MARK: Okay, forget that.
-No, no, no!

07:59.104 --> 08:01.315
-You could be a force for good.
-Like Batman?

08:01.398 --> 08:03.275
-MARK: Yeah, like Batman.
-But are we talking

08:03.358 --> 08:05.611
Dark Knight Batman or
Ben Affleck Batman, because...

08:05.694 --> 08:08.530
MARK: Dude, The Animated Series,
obviously.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.616
HENRY:
No, I’d still take the girl.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.576
I feel like it would
ultimately be more satisfying.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.953
-GOLFER: Yeah! Hole in one!
-MARK: All right.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.914
But it might be harder
than you think.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.750
-Ah!

08:19.833 --> 08:21.710
Dude, you’d get, like,
infinite do-overs.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.712
You’d just iterate.
Straight A-B testing.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.839
Right. If there’s
infinite do-overs,

08:25.923 --> 08:27.716
then sooner or later,
it has to happen.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.677
Just, like, mathematically.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.846
Maybe it’s like pi, though.

08:32.930 --> 08:35.140
Just goes on forever.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.684
There could be infinite ways
for you not to get laid.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.186
-MARK: Yes!

08:41.647 --> 08:43.357
-Oh. -Oh, uh, next time...
-

08:48.320 --> 08:50.364
Then you’d never get out
of the loop.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.326
Right, but why
would you want to?

08:54.409 --> 08:57.120
You’d be the center
of the universe.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.039
-You could do anything.
-Yeah, but it could get

08:59.122 --> 09:01.708
-boring or lonely.
-No way.

09:01.792 --> 09:05.462
Man, I mean, you would be,
like, the king of everything.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.881
-Hi, honey.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.052
-HENRY: Sure, you will.
-DANIEL: No.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.512
But say it’s you
and you tell me.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.138
-I’d just forget.
-Right, but you’d never

09:15.222 --> 09:16.723
-believe me anyway.
-We could’ve had this

09:16.807 --> 09:18.225
exact conversation, like,
50 times already.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.309
-Yeah.
-The repetition.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.103
’Cause it’s not...

09:21.186 --> 09:22.771
No, I don’t think
I am being defensive.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.189
I’m looking at this
as an opportunity.

09:24.273 --> 09:25.524
HENRY:
The isolation.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.943
-

09:28.026 --> 09:30.654
-You’d be like
the last man on Earth.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.660
-

09:39.079 --> 09:42.165
Three, two, one.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.333
-

09:43.417 --> 09:44.543
-HENRY: What,

09:44.626 --> 09:46.378
where you die and respawn?

09:54.011 --> 09:55.345
Morning, Mark.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.472
-Loser.
-Loser.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.977
-

10:02.060 --> 10:03.645
Straight down that way,
and then there’s...

10:03.729 --> 10:05.105
there’s, like, one of those,

10:05.188 --> 10:06.648
-and you just take a right.
-

10:06.732 --> 10:08.275
-Uh, wait.
-Psychic.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.485
Uh, I love psychics!

10:29.254 --> 10:30.881
-

10:57.115 --> 10:58.700
So, what’d she look like?

10:58.784 --> 11:00.452
-She’s kind of tall,
got frizzy hair. -Ah!

11:00.535 --> 11:02.079
Sort of, like, a long nose.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.955
Not, like, a long, long nose,
but like a... like a...

11:04.039 --> 11:05.749
So, not conventionally
the prettiest girl ever.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.125
No, no, she’s cute.
She’s cute.

11:07.209 --> 11:08.377
Oh, so you’re into her.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.052
No.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.637
So you’re not into her.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.973
Well, like,
I’m not not into her.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.518
Dude, then why are you
looking for her?

11:24.601 --> 11:26.561
Okay, fine,
I’m completely in love

11:26.645 --> 11:28.271
with the girl from the pool.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.607
-HENRY: What was she wearing?
-MARK: She was wearing boots.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.234
HENRY:
Who wears boots to the pool?

11:32.317 --> 11:33.610
She’s probably goth.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.654
She’s probably at
the Barnes & Nobles at the mall

11:35.737 --> 11:37.155
reading a manga right now.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.949
Dude, this girl does not
hang out at the mall.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.325
HENRY: She’s too good
for the mall, huh?

11:40.409 --> 11:42.202
MARK: No, she’s not
too good for the mall.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.954
-I didn’t... -HENRY: Mm-hmm.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.747
Feelings for this one you have.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.791
Okay, is that Darth Vader
or Yoda?

11:47.874 --> 11:50.419
-’Cause you have to pick one.
You can’t do both. -

11:59.010 --> 12:01.430
-MAN: Hey!

12:01.513 --> 12:04.099
-

12:06.184 --> 12:07.853
-

12:09.229 --> 12:10.564
Okay, does she have any tattoos?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.023
I’m not trying to I.D.
her corpse.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.901
She did drop a flyer
for a missing dog, though.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.820
HENRY:
Mark, okay.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.655
On the flyer,
it’ll have her phone number.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.032
MARK: Right.
Yeah, and I called the number,

12:21.116 --> 12:22.492
and some guy picked up--

12:22.576 --> 12:24.536
who does have a daughter,
but she’s eight.

12:24.619 --> 12:25.996
And he seemed really upset

12:26.079 --> 12:27.622
that I was using
his personal misfortune

12:27.706 --> 12:28.832
to try and meet a girl.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.375
-Which is...
-Which is fair.

12:30.459 --> 12:31.460
-Yeah, that’s fair.
-That’s fair.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.836
HENRY:
But wait. So she’s looking

12:32.919 --> 12:34.254
for the dog,
but it’s not her dog?

12:34.337 --> 12:36.298
You think maybe
there’s a reward?

12:36.381 --> 12:38.008
Did you try a dog shelter?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.259
-Can I help you?

12:39.342 --> 12:42.179
Uh, y-yeah.
I’m-I’m looking for a girl.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.889
We just have animals.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.765
-Yeah.
-A vet?

12:52.022 --> 12:54.483
-Mm-hmm.
-An alley behind a restaurant?

12:54.566 --> 12:56.526
MARK: I doubt she’s looking
for actual Tramp

12:56.610 --> 12:59.196
from Lady and the Tramp,
but thank you.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.114
HENRY: Maybe it’s better
this way, you know?

13:01.198 --> 13:02.699
Maybe you were gonna
have this, like,

13:02.782 --> 13:04.618
doomed, toxic romance.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.036
Maybe you dodged a bullet.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.874
-Oh!

13:25.472 --> 13:27.057
-Hey, no, no. Hey!

13:27.140 --> 13:28.892
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

13:28.975 --> 13:30.393
Come on.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.653
Great.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.159
Uh, h-hey.

13:51.414 --> 13:52.666
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.959
Uh, I’m Mark.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.503
Uh, I just had a quick question.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.837
-Okay.
-I was wondering...

13:57.921 --> 13:59.548
This is gonna sound
really strange--

13:59.631 --> 14:01.424
God, really bizarre--

14:01.508 --> 14:03.843
but are you experiencing
any kind of temporal anomaly

14:03.927 --> 14:05.720
in your life?

14:08.723 --> 14:10.100
By "temporal anomaly," I mean...

14:10.183 --> 14:12.894
I know what temporal anomaly is.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.354
Okay, great.

14:14.437 --> 14:17.357
So, what specifically
I was wondering is...

14:17.440 --> 14:19.609
The thing where
the same day keeps happening?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.990
Whoa. Okay.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.204
I-I thought nobody else knew.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.456
-Well, somebody does. Um...
-Yeah.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.918
I-I saw you at the pool before.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.296
You caught a-a beach ball, and
that had never happened before.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.924
So I-I figured that
you probably had free will.

14:43.008 --> 14:45.844
I’ve actually been looking
all over for you.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.263
-You have?
-Y-Yeah.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.807
You dropped a flyer
for a missing dog,

14:50.890 --> 14:52.559
and I found it,
and the phone number on it

14:52.642 --> 14:54.019
wasn’t you-yours.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.354
No, it wasn’t.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.106
So, what have you been up to
with, I mean,

14:58.189 --> 15:00.317
like, I guess, in-infinite time?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.152
Oh, you know, like,
solving crimes

15:02.235 --> 15:03.403
and, like, finding true love.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.738
Really?

15:04.821 --> 15:08.908
No. Um, I’ve been
teaching myself how to drive.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.536
Figure it doesn’t matter
if I crash because, you know,

15:11.620 --> 15:12.787
-time loop.
-Time loop, yeah.

15:12.871 --> 15:16.249
-So... -I was gonna try
and-and cure cancer.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.959
-Like that’s what this
was all for. -Oh, wow.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.669
And then when I figured it out,
it would...

15:19.753 --> 15:21.379
time would start up again,
and I would basically

15:21.463 --> 15:24.299
-have saved the entire world.
-Oh. How’s that going?

15:24.382 --> 15:26.384
Not that great. So far,
not a lot of real progress.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.511
Maybe you set your sights,
like, too high.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.888
Yeah. Like, maybe I should have

15:29.971 --> 15:31.806
just tried to cure
athlete’s foot.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.807
Pink eye.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.184
Indigestion.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.394
Well...

15:36.478 --> 15:38.647
-Mark.
-Mark, this has been fun,

15:38.730 --> 15:40.398
but, um, I actually have to go.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.858
-You do?
-Yeah.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.652
You know, ’cause, ’cause, uh

15:43.735 --> 15:45.445
I mean, you know
that the same thing

15:45.528 --> 15:47.155
is just gonna happen again
tomorrow, right?

15:47.238 --> 15:49.032
Yeah.
Yeah, I do know that, yeah.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.284
Sorry. I mean,
but it’s like, you know,

15:51.368 --> 15:53.328
it’s great being
the only one who knows

15:53.411 --> 15:55.497
what’s gonna come next,
but it’s also...

15:55.580 --> 15:58.333
weird.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.043
Like, everything that’s happened

16:00.126 --> 16:01.961
has happened
like a thousand times.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.881
Everyone’s, like,
sleepwalking, you know?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.258
They think this is all there is.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.136
Yeah. Like everyone else
is dreaming

16:10.220 --> 16:11.596
and you’re the only one
who’s awake.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.681
Exactly.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.360
I know you have to go, but-but
you really need to see this.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.295
No, you have to hide.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.299
Here it comes.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.801
-Oh!

16:49.884 --> 16:51.678
-Sorry.
-

16:51.761 --> 16:53.722
-What? Where’s my phone?
-Sammy, the phone!

16:53.805 --> 16:55.306
-Oh, no! Sammy, come back!
-

16:55.390 --> 16:56.599
-Dude, your dog...
-Come on, Sammy!

16:56.683 --> 16:58.184
Your dog is taking my phone!

17:01.229 --> 17:03.690
I’ve watched that
like ten times.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.651
-I think it’s a metaphor
for something. -Hmm.

17:06.735 --> 17:07.986
Come on.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.196
There’s a better one.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.408
Run!

17:13.491 --> 17:15.034
So, he’s explaining

17:15.118 --> 17:17.328
how feminists control the world
and that’s why

17:17.412 --> 17:19.581
no one will read
his poetry, when...

17:21.124 --> 17:24.252
-Quarters-- drops them.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.379
Now the recovery.

17:26.463 --> 17:29.090
Oh, but it would appear his
Linkin Park-style wallet chain

17:29.174 --> 17:31.468
got stuck under his bootheel
and the consequences

17:31.551 --> 17:33.845
were nothing short
of disastrous.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.972
I know it’s wrong to laugh
at other people’s misfortune...

17:36.055 --> 17:39.434
But they are
objectively hilarious.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.316
Um, I really have to go.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.359
C-Could I have your number?

17:48.443 --> 17:50.987
I’m sorry. I know that
it’s kind of like, um...

17:51.070 --> 17:53.156
But I just figured, since we’re
stuck in the same day

17:53.239 --> 17:55.074
for pretty much forever,
it-it’d be good

17:55.158 --> 17:56.659
-to keep in touch.
-Yeah, sure, yeah.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.871
DANIEL:
No, not yet.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.748
No, I don’t think
I am being defensive.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.583
MARK
Eight, five, nine...

18:03.666 --> 18:05.335
-one, seven...
-

18:08.421 --> 18:10.131
-MARGARET: ...true love.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.655
in the air, air, air

18:33.738 --> 18:36.199
he was there

18:36.282 --> 18:37.992
like a ton of bricks

18:41.579 --> 18:43.206
screech to a halt, halt, halt

18:43.289 --> 18:45.250
his cell phone and keys

18:45.333 --> 18:46.918
climbs, climbs

18:47.001 --> 18:50.255
oh, hoping for heaven’s reach

18:50.338 --> 18:52.215
all one by one

18:53.800 --> 18:56.803
then slip over

18:56.886 --> 18:58.680
-

19:04.727 --> 19:07.730
living in my, living

19:07.814 --> 19:12.318
he’s watching me sleeping

19:14.487 --> 19:16.281
living in my

19:16.364 --> 19:19.158
-

19:44.142 --> 19:45.435
Hi.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.688
I’m supposed to be
in summer school.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.692
But I’ve only gone like twice.

19:52.775 --> 19:54.819
I want to... I want to go
to art school,

19:54.903 --> 19:57.822
but my parents are obsessed
with putting me in honors math.

19:57.906 --> 20:01.117
-You’re in honors math,
aren’t you? -No.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.994
I’m in AP.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.662
Why do you think
these things keep happening?

20:04.746 --> 20:05.997
MARK:
I don’t know.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.498
I honestly didn’t figure it out
until there was

20:07.582 --> 20:09.334
-no new Doctor Who.
-

20:09.417 --> 20:12.962
Why? Why do you ask?

20:13.046 --> 20:14.714
-Huh?
-

20:16.633 --> 20:18.134
I don’t know. I’m just glad

20:18.217 --> 20:19.844
that Stephen Hawking
isn’t here to see this,

20:19.928 --> 20:21.679
because it totally violates
all known science.

20:21.763 --> 20:22.931
MARK:
So, what’s the craziest thing

20:23.014 --> 20:25.266
you’ve done so far?

20:25.350 --> 20:27.560
-Crazy, like...? -I tried to
hop a freight train once.

20:27.644 --> 20:28.853
How’d that turn out?

20:28.937 --> 20:31.522
I got way more respect
for hobos now.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.025
I did, however,
ride my bike through school.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.907
Wow. Impressive.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.325
Are you, like, five?

20:42.408 --> 20:45.453
Well, I guess the practical
application is limited.

20:45.536 --> 20:48.206
Okay, but what if you were
driving your Lamborghini

20:48.289 --> 20:50.875
into, like, a candy shop

20:50.959 --> 20:53.753
and the time loop ended
and you were naked?

20:53.836 --> 20:56.005
See, that is exactly
what I’m talking about.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.591
You must have done
at least one cool thing.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.677
MARGARET: I put my chess app
on maximum difficulty.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.512
-MARK: And?
-I lost.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.805
MARK: There’s got to be
something else.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.308
Okay, I’ll show you.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.687
-MARGARET: Hey, watch it!

21:15.900 --> 21:18.444
You ever wish that today
happened on a different day?

21:18.528 --> 21:21.322
Like Christmas or your birthday?

21:21.406 --> 21:23.658
I wish I’d painted my nails
yesterday.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.577
Really? I like them.
It’s just nice.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.538
It’s like a nice, um,
chartreuse, right?

21:28.621 --> 21:30.707
-That’s a green.
-They’re always chipped.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.044
I think that looks cool.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.713
Thank you.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.424
I just wish today
wasn’t the day my dad decides

21:39.507 --> 21:41.718
to have "the talk"
about my future.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.012
Besides, who knows what they
want to be when they’re 17?

21:44.095 --> 21:45.555
-I do.
-Really?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.265
Aerospace engineer.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.726
Specifically a NASA
mission specialist.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.521
Wait. Like an astronaut?

21:55.189 --> 21:57.442
’Cause that’s cool.
That’s like a...

21:57.525 --> 21:59.819
I mean, it’s just,
like, a big call.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.571
MARGARET: I have 20/20 vision,
uncorrected, so...

22:03.656 --> 22:05.533
-You never know how shit

22:05.616 --> 22:07.869
your friend’s taste in music is
till you steal her car.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.746
Y-You stole this car?

22:09.829 --> 22:10.955
I need it more
than Marissa does.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.707
And honestly, this song is

22:12.790 --> 22:15.126
kind of growing on me.
Right?

22:15.209 --> 22:16.377
Bro, my lane!

22:18.254 --> 22:19.881
-Whoa.
-Don’t worry.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.091
I’m pretty sure if I kill us
in a car accident

22:22.175 --> 22:24.260
that we come back to life.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.096
Yeah.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.517
God, there must be a lot
of people who die today.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.896
You only just thought of that?

22:34.979 --> 22:36.898
150,000.

22:36.981 --> 22:40.610
-What? -That’s how many
people die every day-- 150,000.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.820
Geez.

22:42.904 --> 22:44.238
And you’d just go through it

22:44.322 --> 22:45.740
over and over again,
like Sisyphus.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.117
Worse.
He was just pushing a big rock.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.411
-Dude, do you drive?!
-

22:50.495 --> 22:53.206
Sorry, that was depressing.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.874
Yeah.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.335
Probably a lot of people’s
birthday today, too.

22:58.544 --> 22:59.879
Yeah.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.353
Come on.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.651
Come on!
We’re gonna be late.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.497
MARGARET:
Okay.

23:48.636 --> 23:49.679
I don’t get it.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.139
Shh.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.400
I’m good, thanks.

24:05.987 --> 24:07.071
Look.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.341
How did you find that?

24:28.509 --> 24:30.595
I was looking for that dog.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.598
You know, the one on the flyer.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.476
I don’t even know why.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.437
I just have all this...
this time.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.982
I guess I just wanted to try
and, like, fix something.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.401
Which I know doesn’t even
make sense.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.403
You can’t find it anyway.

25:02.043 --> 25:04.670
I think I identify
with that fish.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.515
Okay, Jared. I’m coming.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.480
MARK:
So, I’ll see you around?

25:24.106 --> 25:25.399
-19 million.
-What?

25:26.651 --> 25:29.612
That’s how many people’s
birthday it is today.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.364
Oh.

25:33.074 --> 25:34.617
-Bye, Mark.
-

25:34.700 --> 25:37.078
Hey, did you do that
in your head?

25:42.291 --> 25:44.961
-

25:48.673 --> 25:51.008
DANIEL: No, I don’t think
I am being defensive.

25:51.092 --> 25:53.344
I’m looking at this
as an opportunity.

26:04.146 --> 26:06.607
Three, two...

26:06.691 --> 26:08.985
-

26:09.068 --> 26:10.611
-MARGARET: Crazy, like...?
-

26:30.464 --> 26:32.133
MARGARET:
Mark, I hate to be judgmental,

26:32.216 --> 26:34.260
but why are we watching
a bunch of skate rats?

26:34.343 --> 26:35.344
You’ll see.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.305
It’s like your thing
with the eagle.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.807
It doesn’t really seem that much
like my thing with the eagle.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.518
Margaret, what is
the one universal law

26:42.601 --> 26:44.395
of all skate rats everywhere?

26:44.478 --> 26:47.606
Um, that, ironically,

26:47.690 --> 26:50.735
even though skating
completely identifies them,

26:50.818 --> 26:53.779
they suck at it, like, a lot.

26:53.863 --> 26:55.781
MARK:
Exactly.

26:55.865 --> 26:56.949
You said 2:00.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.576
Yeah, I thought you were
gonna be late.

26:59.660 --> 27:00.995
Any luck with the dog?

27:01.078 --> 27:02.288
-What do you got?
-Oh!

27:02.371 --> 27:05.124
It might be time to give up
on the dog.

27:06.334 --> 27:08.544
-Oh! You all right, man?
-MARGARET: I lied before.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.213
I love being judgmental.

27:13.007 --> 27:15.176
-MARK: Here she comes.
-SKATER: Come on.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.886
Some kind of joke?

27:16.969 --> 27:18.220
Does your mom know you’re here?

27:19.388 --> 27:21.515
There’s no way
you’re landing this!

27:23.476 --> 27:25.353
SKATERS:
Oh!

27:25.436 --> 27:27.021
-

27:31.067 --> 27:32.777
MARK:
Pretty cool, huh?

27:33.986 --> 27:36.030
MARGARET:
Yeah.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.157
Just wanted to hear you say it.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.034
this is real life...

27:40.117 --> 27:42.244
-MARGARET: Whoa!

27:42.328 --> 27:44.163
MARK:
So, who’s Jared?

27:44.246 --> 27:46.582
He’s a med student.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.417
How old is that guy?

27:48.501 --> 27:51.337
21. Graduated Harvard at 19.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.173
-Uh, l-l-look out!
-

27:58.886 --> 28:00.930
-

28:01.013 --> 28:02.932
-MARK: So, I have a theory.
-MARGARET: Yeah?

28:03.015 --> 28:05.434
You know how the fourth
dimension’s supposed to be time?

28:05.518 --> 28:07.228
-Yeah.
-So, what if, like,

28:07.311 --> 28:09.355
these fourth-dimensional beings
are sort of, like,

28:09.438 --> 28:11.732
toying with us?
Like, they bent time in a circle

28:11.816 --> 28:14.026
and now we have to live the
same day over and over again,

28:14.110 --> 28:15.653
-like on a hamster wheel.
-Right.

28:15.736 --> 28:16.737
For their amusement.

28:16.821 --> 28:18.114
Except time’s not
the fourth dimension.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.365
-It’s not?
-No.

28:19.448 --> 28:20.866
Not in any meaningful
Euclidean sense.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.535
Oh, yeah, well,
of course it’s not.

28:22.618 --> 28:23.536
Incoming.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.247
Incoming!

28:28.666 --> 28:29.834
Mmm.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.669
That’s what I think
that this is all about.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.462
What, eating all the ice cream
in the world

28:33.546 --> 28:34.922
and not getting fat?

28:35.005 --> 28:37.466
No, you showed me this
when you showed me the eagle.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.176
I mean, think about it.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.053
Most of life is just junk,
right?

28:41.137 --> 28:42.221
It’s-it’s filler.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.973
-Hmm.
-And then...

28:44.056 --> 28:46.851
there’s these moments

28:46.934 --> 28:50.271
when all the randomness turns
into something perfect.

28:50.354 --> 28:53.649
It’s like life’s dropping
all the bullshit

28:53.732 --> 28:56.068
just for a second
to show us how amazing

28:56.152 --> 28:59.113
it could be all the time
if it wanted to.

28:59.196 --> 29:01.866
Hmm. I don’t know.

29:01.949 --> 29:05.619
I think maybe we’re supposed
to become, like, better people.

29:05.703 --> 29:08.205
Though I honestly don’t even
know how that could be possible.

29:08.289 --> 29:09.457
I mean, think about it.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.000
We must miss so many of them.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.002
All those tiny perfect things,

29:13.085 --> 29:14.962
they’re just-- poof-- gone.

29:15.045 --> 29:16.881
Lost forever.

29:18.466 --> 29:20.593
But not today.

29:20.676 --> 29:23.804
That is a disturbingly
inspirational idea, Mark.

29:23.888 --> 29:26.932
But-- mmm-- I have to go.

29:32.188 --> 29:34.482
Why do I always feel like,
even though we’re stuck

29:34.565 --> 29:37.026
in the same day together,
I am never gonna see you again?

29:37.109 --> 29:40.196
Because you watch
too much Doctor Who.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.448
Wait.
What if we found them all?

29:45.409 --> 29:48.037
-What do you mean?
-All the perfect things

29:48.120 --> 29:52.208
in this one town,
in this one day...

29:52.291 --> 29:53.542
We could collect them.

29:53.626 --> 29:54.919
Like Pokémon?

29:55.002 --> 29:57.171
Kind of like Pokémon.

29:58.589 --> 30:00.466
We’d be like partners.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.010
I mean, talk about
seizing the day.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.137
The day’s been seized.

30:05.221 --> 30:07.890
It’s right here.
It’s waiting for us.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.643
Mark, you don’t understand,
okay?

30:10.726 --> 30:11.894
I’m not like you.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.979
I don’t want to seize the day.

30:14.063 --> 30:16.857
I just don’t want the day
to seize me.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.152
Okay?

30:24.782 --> 30:27.201
I’m just trying
to get through this.

30:27.284 --> 30:29.078
So am I.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.457
We’re not that different,
Margaret.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.084
We’re not like other people.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.294
Everyone else gets
a brand-new day every day,

30:37.378 --> 30:40.548
but not us--
this is the only one we have.

30:40.631 --> 30:44.552
Sometimes I think,
what if it’s not enough?

30:46.095 --> 30:48.305
I just want it
to mean something.

30:51.058 --> 30:54.728
Besides, you know, it’s just us.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.732
Everyone else is asleep.

31:12.746 --> 31:15.332
MARGARET: You know what you
said about the fourth dimension?

31:15.416 --> 31:16.792
MARK:
The one that’s not time?

31:16.875 --> 31:19.211
MARGARET:
Yeah. It’s still not time.

31:19.295 --> 31:23.007
But I’ve been thinking about
what it really is, and...

31:23.090 --> 31:25.217
You know we have
three dimensions, right?

31:25.301 --> 31:26.844
-Right?
-Go on.

31:26.927 --> 31:28.429
Okay, so now think
about your shadow.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.097
Okay, your shadow
is two-dimensional.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.307
It’s flat.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.100
So think about something
that would cast

31:33.183 --> 31:35.394
a three-dimensional shadow--
that’s the fourth dimension.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.980
I mean, technically,
we’re just the shadows

31:38.063 --> 31:40.190
of four-dimensional people.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.861
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.451
Somebody actually figured out
what a 4D cube would look like.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.498
I taught myself how to draw it.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.418
When I was little, I used to
look for it everywhere.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.465
I mean, theoretically,
it’s around us all the time.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.884
We’re just not looking
in the right direction.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.561
You could see everything
from in there.

32:19.021 --> 32:21.732
And you could see inside things,
you could never get lost.

32:21.815 --> 32:25.444
It’s like the whole world
is a map of itself.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.580
But I never found it.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.459
I guess this is all there is.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.462
So you just gave up?

32:43.545 --> 32:46.006
Well, if the fourth dimension
wants to stop hiding

32:46.090 --> 32:48.759
like a little bitch,
it knows where to find me.

32:49.927 --> 32:51.845
-

32:54.682 --> 32:56.600
MARGARET:
So, how are we gonna do it?

32:56.684 --> 32:58.268
MARK:
Do what?

32:58.352 --> 32:59.895
MARGARET: Find the
perfect things or whatever.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.189
We need a methodology, right?

33:02.272 --> 33:04.733
Like a... like a system?

33:04.817 --> 33:07.820
Well, we want to be rigorous
about it, so maybe, like,

33:07.903 --> 33:10.280
take a survey map of the town
and, like, lay a grid over it

33:10.364 --> 33:13.117
and split it up into squares,
each square is a 24-hour log,

33:13.200 --> 33:14.743
and then you could take half,
and I...

33:14.827 --> 33:17.371
Or we could just walk around
looking for cool stuff.

33:17.454 --> 33:20.040
-Like partners?
-Like allies.

33:20.124 --> 33:21.500
Like the U.S. and Canada.

33:21.583 --> 33:22.710
-And I’ll be...
-I’m Canada.

33:22.793 --> 33:23.961
-No, you can’t be Can--
-Too slow.

33:24.044 --> 33:25.462
-I’m Canada.
-Sir?

33:31.427 --> 33:33.387
-You did not.
-Oh, yes.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.055
MARK:
That was my thing.

33:35.139 --> 33:36.807
That’s my thing.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.684
-Well, I took your thing.
-I showed you that.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.686
I took it.

33:41.937 --> 33:44.857
-

33:49.319 --> 33:51.697
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:01.123 --> 34:04.001
his Summer Bear

34:04.084 --> 34:07.129
his little lungs with air

34:08.964 --> 34:11.508
he didn’t care

34:36.742 --> 34:40.245
upon the shore

34:41.663 --> 34:44.541
had failed before

34:47.461 --> 34:51.465
with that slender hair

34:51.548 --> 34:54.092
she sent to me

34:54.176 --> 34:56.512
wondering

34:56.595 --> 35:00.432
have the courage to

35:06.563 --> 35:08.440
-

35:10.567 --> 35:11.860
I’m sorry.

35:13.654 --> 35:17.825
emerged from the sea

35:17.908 --> 35:20.619
from his journey

35:20.702 --> 35:23.163
I’ve come for thee"

35:48.605 --> 35:52.317
with that slender hair

35:52.401 --> 35:54.987
she sent to me

35:55.070 --> 35:56.989
-

35:57.072 --> 35:59.658
have the courage to

35:59.741 --> 36:01.952
-It’s on!
-

36:13.088 --> 36:14.590
You know all that math
you’re supposed to be learning?

36:14.673 --> 36:15.966
Maybe.

36:16.049 --> 36:17.384
I’m gonna teach it to you.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.760
No.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.512
I can’t keep hanging out
with someone who’s ignorant

36:20.596 --> 36:21.597
of basic logarithmic functions.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.473
Mark, Mark, look at yourself.

36:23.557 --> 36:26.476
You’re a nerd who sucks at math.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.853
Where does that leave you?

36:27.936 --> 36:29.688
So, the first thing

36:29.771 --> 36:34.276
that you need to know about math
is that it’s always perfect.

36:34.359 --> 36:35.986
If I don’t use this stuff
later in life,

36:36.069 --> 36:38.155
my fat, bitter middle-aged self
is gonna find you...

36:38.238 --> 36:39.948
MARGARET:
Look.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.492
Mm.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.084
Wow.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.715
Can I tell you a secret?

36:56.798 --> 36:58.091
Of course.

36:58.175 --> 37:01.511
MARGARET: Sometimes I don’t
want this day to end.

37:01.595 --> 37:04.139
I just want time
to stay broken forever.

37:12.856 --> 37:15.484
Have you ever seen Time Bandits?

37:15.567 --> 37:17.653
What is that?

37:17.736 --> 37:19.947
OMG, you’ve-you’ve never heard
of Time Bandits?

37:20.030 --> 37:22.366
-Don’t do that.
-What?

37:22.449 --> 37:25.077
Don’t say "OMG"
like it’s a thing people say.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.788
Okay, well, I mean,
this is why time stopped--

37:27.871 --> 37:29.539
so that you can see the greatest

37:29.623 --> 37:31.667
-motion picture about time...
-Mark, I have to go.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.418
Okay, blow him off,
just this once.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.003
Okay? Jared will
totally forgive you.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.172
-All right, just...
-Mark, I just have to go, okay?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.507
He’ll immediately forgive...
You don’t even...

37:38.590 --> 37:40.550
I-I got it.

37:40.634 --> 37:42.886
SUPREME BEING
Return the map.

37:42.970 --> 37:46.098
Return what you have stolen.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.558
You’re watching
Time Bandits again?

37:48.642 --> 37:51.478
MARK:
Yep, never gets old.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.817
You’re getting better.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.403
Thanks.

37:59.486 --> 38:02.072
So, Mark, I know it’s late...

38:02.155 --> 38:06.868
but I was hoping
we could have a talk.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.330
About your future.

38:10.414 --> 38:12.374
I’m so glad you brought that up,
because I’ve actually

38:12.457 --> 38:14.292
been considering
joining the priesthood.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.795
-Uh-huh. Okay.
-Or...

38:16.878 --> 38:18.547
the Space Force.

38:19.756 --> 38:22.050
Better yet, the Space Priests.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.927
Space Priests?

38:24.011 --> 38:26.805
Right. Is that-- Do you have to
go to seminary school

38:26.888 --> 38:29.516
-and aeronautics school
for that? -Uh-huh.

38:29.599 --> 38:31.435
Uh-huh. Okay. Right.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.687
Well, I wouldn’t make
any snap decisions.

38:33.770 --> 38:34.896
On that note...

38:35.981 --> 38:37.858
-Oh, my God!
-

38:38.859 --> 38:39.901
MARK:
So, who’s Jared?

39:03.842 --> 39:05.886
HENRY: Just a little bit
of sniper rifle.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.596
MARK:
So I met this girl.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.347
-Her name’s Margaret... -Wait,
wait, wait. You met a girl?

39:09.431 --> 39:10.932
Yeah.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.893
-When?
-Couple days ago.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.269
Dude, I saw you last night.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.520
-You didn’t tell me anything
about a girl. -I know.

39:15.604 --> 39:16.938
I didn’t want to make
a big deal out of it.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.273
You don’t have to
make it a big deal.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.733
-It is objectively big.
-Okay, so, the point...

39:19.816 --> 39:21.818
-It’s just, it’s not adding up.
-The-the point is that

39:21.902 --> 39:23.904
I never used to say
this kind of stuff before,

39:23.987 --> 39:26.239
but I feel
like we have a connection.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.662
I’m sorry. This is just
a continuity nightmare.

39:32.746 --> 39:34.873
Every night, it’s 6:00 p.m.,
we’re hanging out,

39:34.956 --> 39:36.875
and boom-- she disappears.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.919
Like a vampire.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.879
-Actually, that’s more like
a reverse vampire. -Okay.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.298
Which is basically just
a regular human, I mean...

39:43.381 --> 39:45.717
-O-Okay. -Okay, then if she
won’t go on a date with you,

39:45.801 --> 39:47.177
then just spend a day with her.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.678
Did that.

39:48.762 --> 39:50.639
Okay, then take her
on a stealth date.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.391
Just you two hanging out,
no big deal,

39:53.475 --> 39:56.394
and then bit by bit,
by imperceptible degrees,

39:56.478 --> 39:58.313
things get
more and more romantic.

39:59.481 --> 40:00.982
And then bam!

40:01.066 --> 40:02.400
You kiss her.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.279
I don’t think that’s the sound
effect that I would go for...

40:06.363 --> 40:08.657
-Okay, but you got to get
the kiss, though. -I know.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.200
You just have to
take her to a spot

40:10.283 --> 40:12.160
that shows
that you really get her.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.788
I mean, you do get her, right?

40:16.123 --> 40:18.041
MARGARET:
So, to be clear, this isn’t

40:18.125 --> 40:19.709
-a perfect thing?
-No, uh...

40:19.793 --> 40:21.753
I thought it could be fun
to take a break.

40:21.837 --> 40:24.089
Hmm. I feel a little
bait-and-switched here.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.091
Gonna be fun.

40:27.676 --> 40:29.261
You only live once.

40:29.344 --> 40:31.805
Oh, I see what you did there.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.773
You practiced that.

40:41.857 --> 40:44.651
-Yeah, like a million times.
-

40:44.734 --> 40:46.945
MARGARET: Um, I don’t have
great associations

40:47.028 --> 40:49.281
with this gym,
which will not be improved

40:49.364 --> 40:51.199
if some security guard
comes in here and tases us.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.993
Oh, it’s okay, I’ll just
tell him it was all my idea.

40:53.076 --> 40:55.328
This was your idea.

41:02.878 --> 41:04.379
What?

41:04.462 --> 41:06.673
BRUCE McCANDLESS II: Ah, we’re
getting a picture on the TV.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.843
BUZZ ALDRIN:
You got a good picture, huh?

41:09.926 --> 41:12.512
McCANDLESS: Uh, there’s
a great deal of contrast in it,

41:12.596 --> 41:15.724
and, uh, currently it’s
upside down on our monitor,

41:15.807 --> 41:18.310
but we can make out
a fair amount of detail.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.611
Here, we got to put these on.

41:27.694 --> 41:29.446
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

41:43.376 --> 41:44.878
McCANDLESS:
Okay, Neil, we can see you

41:44.961 --> 41:46.630
coming down the ladder now.

41:52.469 --> 41:54.095
What?!

41:54.179 --> 41:56.097
NEIL ARMSTRONG:
Okay, I just checked

41:56.181 --> 41:58.433
getting back up to
that first step, Buzz.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.895
It’s, uh... the strut isn’t
collapsed too far,

42:01.978 --> 42:04.731
but it’s adequate
to get back up.

42:04.814 --> 42:06.233
McCANDLESS:
Roger. We copy.

42:06.316 --> 42:07.651
ARMSTRONG:
Takes a pretty good little jump.

42:14.157 --> 42:17.202
That’s one small step
for Margaret...

42:17.285 --> 42:19.329
No, don’t ruin it.

42:22.958 --> 42:25.377
You know the real flag
fell over?

42:28.046 --> 42:30.674
It got knocked down
when they took off

42:30.757 --> 42:32.259
to go back to Earth.

42:34.010 --> 42:36.680
Maybe you could put it back up.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.768
Space food?

42:50.902 --> 42:52.862
What?

42:56.574 --> 42:59.494
MARGARET: Come in,
come in, come in, Mark.

43:11.464 --> 43:13.008
Why did you do this?

43:13.091 --> 43:15.385
I-I just had some time to kill.

43:15.468 --> 43:18.305
No, you didn’t. Not really.

43:18.388 --> 43:20.265
How did you do it?

43:20.348 --> 43:22.475
Well, I had a lot of practice,
for one.

43:22.559 --> 43:27.147
And then I-I may
or may not have bribed

43:27.230 --> 43:29.816
all of the kids
in the art department.

43:31.735 --> 43:35.196
I just, I wanted to, um...

43:40.660 --> 43:42.912
Uh, you know...

43:42.996 --> 43:44.831
What?

43:51.129 --> 43:53.173
There’s one more thing.

43:53.256 --> 43:55.175
What?

43:56.634 --> 43:59.095
We have to get back to Earth.

43:59.179 --> 44:01.681
-How?
-With a space shuttle.

44:01.765 --> 44:03.516
Space shuttles are suborbital;

44:03.600 --> 44:05.560
they don’t actually go
to the moon.

44:12.525 --> 44:16.112
MARK: I promise,
you will not regret this.

44:19.115 --> 44:21.409
MARGARET:
No.

44:23.370 --> 44:25.372
-Ah!

44:25.455 --> 44:27.332
-I already regret this.
-I wasn’t ready yet.

44:27.415 --> 44:29.376
-Okay.
-Okay.

44:30.960 --> 44:34.339
-

44:40.303 --> 44:42.347
MARGARET:
Oh, no, no, no!

44:42.430 --> 44:44.391
-MARGARET: Oh, my God! Ah!

44:44.474 --> 44:47.102
JACK KING: 15 seconds,
guidance is internal.

44:47.185 --> 44:50.814
-12, 11, ten, nine...
-Ah!

44:50.897 --> 44:52.982
-Ignition sequence start.

44:53.066 --> 44:54.609
Well, hang on!

44:54.692 --> 44:56.820
Six, five, four,

44:56.903 --> 45:00.490
-three, two, one, zero.
-

45:00.573 --> 45:03.618
All engines running.
Liftoff!

45:03.701 --> 45:07.163
We have a liftoff,
32 minutes past the hour.

45:07.247 --> 45:08.998
Liftoff...

45:26.558 --> 45:30.353
And you wake up at exactly
the same time every morning,

45:30.437 --> 45:33.064
except, you know,
if you stayed up all night,

45:33.148 --> 45:34.649
-you’d mess it up.
-Right.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.443
-You-you’d crash the system.
-You’d think.

45:36.526 --> 45:38.153
-Except you can’t!
-Except you can’t.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.029
Because something puts you
to bed at midnight

45:40.113 --> 45:42.240
-every night, like...
-Mm-hmm.

45:42.323 --> 45:46.286
-Ah. -It’s like you get
kidnapped by some cosmic nanny.

45:46.369 --> 45:48.455
It’s so creepy.

45:51.666 --> 45:53.626
Is there anyone home?

45:53.710 --> 45:56.921
Uh, no. My sister’s
at violin practice,

45:57.005 --> 46:00.675
and my dad has
old-person Pilates.

46:03.928 --> 46:05.722
You want a...?

46:07.557 --> 46:09.476
Why not?

46:30.914 --> 46:32.582
Are these your parents?

46:32.665 --> 46:34.250
Oh, uh, yeah.

46:34.334 --> 46:36.628
Yeah, my mom works late tonight,

46:36.711 --> 46:39.631
so I basically never see her,
which is kind of

46:39.714 --> 46:42.383
the hardest part about the...
this whole thing.

46:42.467 --> 46:44.844
-Hmm.
-My dad recently quit his job

46:44.928 --> 46:48.640
to write a not-that-interesting
story about the Civil War.

46:48.723 --> 46:50.642
What about you?

46:50.725 --> 46:52.310
What?

46:52.393 --> 46:54.103
Your parents.

46:54.187 --> 46:56.022
Old people that look like you.

46:56.105 --> 46:57.524
Yeah.

46:57.607 --> 46:59.359
-What do you want to do?
-BOY It’s evil!

46:59.442 --> 47:02.153
Don’t touch it!

47:06.032 --> 47:07.617
So, at the end,
why is Sean Connery

47:07.700 --> 47:09.244
cosplaying as a fireman?

47:09.327 --> 47:10.995
-It’s part of the mystery.
-Hmm.

47:20.797 --> 47:22.799
I have to pee.

47:24.300 --> 47:26.719
Because beer.

47:26.803 --> 47:28.888
You should probably do that
in the bathroom.

47:28.972 --> 47:30.932
Yeah.

48:01.296 --> 48:03.631
-It is completely...

48:03.715 --> 48:05.633
hopeless. Okay.

48:13.808 --> 48:16.185
Um, no. No, no, no. No. Uh...

48:16.269 --> 48:17.812
-What is this?
-No.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.772
Hmm?

48:21.024 --> 48:22.358
It’s a work in progress.

48:22.442 --> 48:24.819
You made a map of everything.

48:24.902 --> 48:27.280
-The whole day.
-All the perfect things.

48:27.363 --> 48:29.866
But you must have just done it,
like, this morning.

48:29.949 --> 48:32.118
Well, I-I draw it
pretty much every day.

48:32.201 --> 48:33.411
Wow.

48:33.494 --> 48:35.663
Boys are so weird.

48:37.790 --> 48:39.751
It’s really good.

48:41.127 --> 48:44.255
Maybe you should go
to art school.

48:44.339 --> 48:48.426
This is gonna sound stupid,
but I, uh...

48:48.509 --> 48:51.471
sometimes I think
if I stare at it long enough,

48:51.554 --> 48:55.183
I’ll find something, like a...
like a pattern.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.060
-Hmm.
-I never do.

48:57.143 --> 48:58.519
That does sound pretty stupid.

48:58.603 --> 48:59.979
Well, okay.

49:00.063 --> 49:02.815
MARGARET:
And "tree house"-- two words.

49:06.861 --> 49:09.489
MARGARET:
You made a map of us.

49:09.572 --> 49:11.658
MARK: Too bad it’s just
gonna get erased.

49:11.741 --> 49:13.868
MARGARET:
Yeah, it’s too bad.

49:30.093 --> 49:32.095
I can’t.

49:35.390 --> 49:38.184
-Oh, um, okay. Yeah, no.
-I’m sorry.

49:38.267 --> 49:40.520
I should go.

49:41.604 --> 49:42.980
Yeah, Margaret,
are you all right?

49:43.064 --> 49:44.232
Why shouldn’t I be all right?

49:44.315 --> 49:46.442
I mean, is-is this about Jared?

49:46.526 --> 49:48.319
-No. -’Cause he’s not
gonna call for, like,

49:48.403 --> 49:49.570
-another four minutes.
-Oh, my God.

49:49.654 --> 49:51.739
-Can you just let that go?
-I just feel like

49:51.823 --> 49:53.408
there’s something that you’re
not telling me, and I-I just

49:53.491 --> 49:55.201
-want to let you know that
you can. -Well, you’re wrong.

49:55.284 --> 49:56.577
Okay? So too fucking bad.

50:01.833 --> 50:05.211
Look, Mark...

50:05.294 --> 50:08.131
-We’re castaways.

50:08.214 --> 50:10.508
Except instead of an island,

50:10.591 --> 50:12.051
we’re marooned in a day.

50:12.135 --> 50:14.095
We’re stuck here together.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.764
So I just think that

50:16.848 --> 50:21.477
we need to be careful
to not mess it up.

50:21.561 --> 50:24.731
The "perfect things" thing--
that was great.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.861
But maybe that’s enough.

50:33.531 --> 50:35.658
I just think that maybe
we should be friends.

50:37.326 --> 50:39.078
And have fun with it.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.252
I don’t want to.

50:48.963 --> 50:51.299
Well, that’s all I got.

50:53.843 --> 50:56.554
So take it or leave it.

51:01.476 --> 51:04.562
Yeah, I guess I’ll take it.

51:07.356 --> 51:08.941
I’ll call you tomorrow.

51:09.025 --> 51:10.568
Today.

51:10.651 --> 51:12.737
Tomorrow.

51:34.175 --> 51:36.803
-

51:59.867 --> 52:01.619
WEATHER REPORTER
You’re going to be looking

52:01.702 --> 52:03.621
at the rain hitting ground
midnight tonight,

52:03.704 --> 52:05.498
moving in from the coast.

52:05.581 --> 52:08.376
Not expecting to have too much
in the way of wind, but...

52:08.459 --> 52:10.294
Morning, Mark.

52:17.635 --> 52:19.387
How’s Mom?

52:20.680 --> 52:24.058
She’s... fine.

52:24.141 --> 52:26.769
Good.

52:26.853 --> 52:28.980
Loser.

52:29.063 --> 52:30.857
MARK: It seemed like
she was opening up.

52:30.940 --> 52:32.900
You know? Seemed happy.

52:32.984 --> 52:35.361
Not, like, happy-happy,
but happy for Margaret.

52:35.444 --> 52:37.405
That’s rough, bro.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.323
She sounds like
an awesome person.

52:39.407 --> 52:40.700
MARK:
Mm.

52:40.783 --> 52:42.535
Nah, I’m joking.
I literally have no idea

52:42.618 --> 52:44.412
who you’re talking about.
Oh, no!

52:44.495 --> 52:45.830
-Shotgun, shotgun.
-

52:45.913 --> 52:48.875
-What am I doing?
-Not in the face. No!

52:51.794 --> 52:54.297
MARK:
Those are imperial elites.

52:54.380 --> 52:56.382
They have four arms.

52:56.465 --> 52:59.260
It’s like bringing a shotgun
to a maser fight.

52:59.343 --> 53:01.721
Well, maybe it’s better
this way, you know?

53:01.804 --> 53:03.931
Maybe you were gonna have
this doomed toxic romance.

53:04.015 --> 53:05.474
Hey, maybe you dodged a bullet.

53:05.558 --> 53:07.643
Feelings for this one you have.

53:07.727 --> 53:09.645
-MARK: Yep.
-Mmm, I’m in love with this

53:09.729 --> 53:11.480
-mystery girl, in love...
-Okay. Enough, enough.

53:11.564 --> 53:13.691
-Enough.
-Of what, exactly?

53:13.774 --> 53:15.902
This is the problem.
I thought maybe if I went around

53:15.985 --> 53:17.904
enough times, I’d get it right,
but I guess not.

53:17.987 --> 53:19.530
You know what,
maybe it is like pi.

53:19.614 --> 53:22.408
It’s just wake up,
rejection, repeat.

53:23.492 --> 53:25.202
Is that from Edge of Tomorrow?

53:25.286 --> 53:26.329
Yeah, it is.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.374
Nice.

53:34.545 --> 53:37.131
DANIEL:
Mark? Mark, is that you?

53:39.091 --> 53:40.676
Oh, hey.

53:40.760 --> 53:43.429
-I’m glad I caught you.
-

53:43.512 --> 53:45.097
Uh, I was just...

53:46.974 --> 53:49.727
I was just hoping we could
talk about your future.

53:49.810 --> 53:51.145
Chubby Hubby?

53:52.605 --> 53:54.815
Here’s the thing, Dad.

53:54.899 --> 53:56.651
I don’t have a future.

53:56.734 --> 53:59.236
You know, I’ve heard that
before from people your age,

53:59.320 --> 54:01.072
and it’s pessimistic.

54:01.155 --> 54:03.616
And frankly,
I think it’s a little glib.

54:03.699 --> 54:05.701
Well, I’m a little tired of

54:05.785 --> 54:08.454
being the only one around here
that knows what’s going on.

54:08.537 --> 54:11.666
Look, I know about the climate.

54:11.749 --> 54:13.668
I’m... I am woke.

54:13.751 --> 54:15.753
-Do not do that "okay, boomer"
thing with me. -No.

54:15.836 --> 54:17.129
That’s not...
that’s not what I mean.

54:17.213 --> 54:20.091
Bottom line...

54:20.174 --> 54:22.093
art school is expensive,

54:22.176 --> 54:25.513
and when you graduate,
what happens?

54:25.596 --> 54:26.931
I’m not gonna graduate, Dad.

54:27.014 --> 54:28.808
No one is graduating,

54:28.891 --> 54:30.977
because time is broken.

54:34.146 --> 54:35.731
Sorry, metaphorically?

54:35.815 --> 54:37.358
You have no idea what it’s like

54:37.441 --> 54:40.653
to just have your future
canceled for no reason.

54:40.736 --> 54:42.613
And don’t lecture me
about art school

54:42.697 --> 54:44.657
when you quit your job
to write some

54:44.740 --> 54:46.367
midlife crisis vanity book.

54:46.450 --> 54:48.703
I don’t think that’s
entirely fair, Mark.

54:48.786 --> 54:51.455
Why didn’t you just
dye your hair?

54:51.539 --> 54:53.791
Or, like,
take a knife skills class?

54:53.874 --> 54:58.629
Or-or just buy a Tesla, Dad.

54:58.713 --> 55:00.923
Just buy a Tesla.

55:14.562 --> 55:17.231
Could you please stop for a sec?

55:17.314 --> 55:20.192
Just a second? Emma, Emma,
could you please stop?

55:20.276 --> 55:22.653
-I-I am begging you, please.
-Okay.

55:22.737 --> 55:24.363
Okay.

55:25.823 --> 55:28.117
Thank you.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.327
-So, did you talk to Dad?
-What?

55:30.411 --> 55:33.289
He’s been stalking you all day.

55:33.372 --> 55:36.042
I may have yelled at him.

55:36.125 --> 55:37.710
You yelled at Dad?

55:40.671 --> 55:45.801
I may or may not have told him
to purchase a Tesla.

55:45.885 --> 55:47.720
Is that a euphemism?

55:47.803 --> 55:49.472
No.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.939
It’s just, when he quit
his job, I thought,

55:59.023 --> 56:01.442
"I get this.

56:01.525 --> 56:03.652
He’s doing what he wants.
He’s following his passion."

56:03.736 --> 56:05.488
And then when I try and do it,

56:05.571 --> 56:07.490
suddenly I’m lazy
and irresponsible.

56:07.573 --> 56:09.366
He didn’t quit.

56:11.118 --> 56:13.996
You know Dad got fired, right?

56:15.998 --> 56:18.167
I don’t think he messed up
or anything.

56:18.250 --> 56:21.462
They just didn’t need him
anymore.

56:21.545 --> 56:23.255
And he doesn’t want
to admit that,

56:23.339 --> 56:25.549
because he’s in
such a shame spiral.

56:25.633 --> 56:27.927
And Mom’s mad at him
for losing his job,

56:28.010 --> 56:30.179
but she doesn’t want
to admit that

56:30.262 --> 56:32.807
because it’d just
come across as too mean.

56:32.890 --> 56:36.352
They’re just stuck right now.

56:37.436 --> 56:39.355
Stuck.

56:39.438 --> 56:41.148
I don’t even think
he minds you going

56:41.232 --> 56:42.817
to that art school so much.

56:42.900 --> 56:46.028
We just can’t afford it now.

56:47.780 --> 56:49.907
How do you know all this?

56:49.990 --> 56:52.118
Psychic powers.

56:52.201 --> 56:53.536
Really?

56:53.619 --> 56:55.287
No.

56:55.371 --> 56:58.082
Because I think about
other people besides myself.

56:58.165 --> 57:00.126
You should try it sometime.

57:08.467 --> 57:10.427
Hey, Em?

57:12.847 --> 57:14.765
How’d your game go?

57:14.849 --> 57:16.392
We lost, three to nothing.

57:18.394 --> 57:20.771
I’m sorry.

57:20.855 --> 57:22.857
Yeah.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.400
Keep working on that.

57:24.483 --> 57:26.944
-

57:29.655 --> 57:31.448
-Uh, hi.
-How can I help you?

57:31.532 --> 57:34.743
Um, I’m-I’m in
your algebra class.

57:34.827 --> 57:36.579
I-I just had a quick question.

57:36.662 --> 57:38.330
I don’t think
I’ve ever seen you before.

57:38.414 --> 57:40.082
Yeah, yeah,
I’ve been sick a lot.

57:40.166 --> 57:43.210
Like, really a lot.

57:43.294 --> 57:46.922
So, suppose, theoretically,
that something happened to time.

57:47.006 --> 57:49.925
Like, the flow of time.

57:50.009 --> 57:51.844
Like, instead of going
in a straight line,

57:51.927 --> 57:53.929
like, it-it just got stuck
in a circle

57:54.013 --> 57:56.098
and-and kept repeating
over and over.

57:56.182 --> 57:57.808
-Wasn’t there a movie...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:57.892 --> 58:00.728
What I wanted to figure out
is what could cause that.

58:00.811 --> 58:03.147
I’ve been doing some research.

58:03.230 --> 58:05.524
Could the Earth have fallen
into a wormhole?

58:05.608 --> 58:06.984
What?

58:08.861 --> 58:11.280
I-I mean, I don’t think so.

58:11.363 --> 58:14.283
What if it got accelerated
past the speed of light?

58:14.366 --> 58:16.368
No.

58:16.452 --> 58:17.995
Is reality just a simulation?

58:18.078 --> 58:20.456
That is unlikely but possible.

58:20.539 --> 58:21.540
-Ancient curse?
-No.

58:21.624 --> 58:22.583
Cosmic nanny?

58:22.666 --> 58:24.376
I don’t even know
what that means.

58:24.460 --> 58:25.836
Is time just a big ball

58:25.920 --> 58:27.838
of wibbly-wobbly
timey-wimey stuff?

58:27.922 --> 58:30.424
Okay, that-that’s a quote
from Doctor Who.

58:30.507 --> 58:32.593
I really don’t remember
seeing you in my class.

58:32.676 --> 58:34.136
What if we’re in hell?

58:34.220 --> 58:36.096
Like we did something bad

58:36.180 --> 58:38.849
and now we have to live this
one day forever as punishment?

58:38.933 --> 58:41.852
This conversation is something
how I imagine hell would be.

58:41.936 --> 58:44.188
Maybe your spiritual advisor
would be

58:44.271 --> 58:46.649
-a more appropriate person...
-What about a singularity?

58:47.858 --> 58:49.735
You know, those black hole
things where physics

58:49.818 --> 58:51.111
gets all weird?

58:51.195 --> 58:52.655
Yeah, I know what
a singularity is.

58:52.738 --> 58:55.032
And, I mean, sure, in theory,

58:55.115 --> 58:58.202
a singularity could produce
a local temporal anomaly.

58:58.285 --> 59:01.163
So we would just
have to get out of it.

59:01.247 --> 59:04.875
Like, get on a plane...

59:04.959 --> 59:06.877
and fly out of it.

59:06.961 --> 59:08.879
Why not?
Now, if you’ll excuse me,

59:08.963 --> 59:11.131
I have to go do the same thing
I did yesterday

59:11.215 --> 59:14.009
and then forget about it.

59:20.266 --> 59:22.851
-

59:22.935 --> 59:24.520
Perfect thing alert.

59:29.358 --> 59:31.110
False alarm.

59:32.444 --> 59:34.280
I’m starting to think
maybe we found them all.

59:36.115 --> 59:38.242
Just had a theory that
when we found the last one,

59:38.325 --> 59:40.327
that time would start up again.

59:40.411 --> 59:41.829
I guess not.

59:41.912 --> 59:43.539
-To be honest,

59:43.622 --> 59:46.709
I’m kind of over the whole
"perfect thing" thing.

59:46.792 --> 59:49.378
You realize it’s never
gonna be Christmas?

59:49.461 --> 59:51.505
Cool. You hate Christmas.

59:51.588 --> 59:53.924
Yeah, but I don’t want
to not have it.

59:55.467 --> 59:57.469
I just feel like screaming
at everyone,

59:57.553 --> 59:59.638
"This isn’t real.
You’re asleep.

59:59.722 --> 1:00:01.265
-Wake up."
-What? Whoa.

1:00:01.348 --> 1:00:03.434
God, they’re like zombies.

1:00:03.517 --> 1:00:05.060
You’re a zombie.

1:00:05.144 --> 1:00:06.770
MARK: I’m serious, Margaret.
It’s time.

1:00:06.854 --> 1:00:08.731
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Trust me, Jason,

1:00:08.814 --> 1:00:10.858
-that’s more your thing.
-Do I know you?

1:00:10.941 --> 1:00:13.027
-Why? -Why? It’s like you said,
we’re stuck here.

1:00:13.110 --> 1:00:14.737
I didn’t mean "stuck" stuck.

1:00:14.820 --> 1:00:17.323
Everybody else is stuck.
We’re free.

1:00:17.406 --> 1:00:19.992
Free from getting older,
from going to school,

1:00:20.075 --> 1:00:22.494
-from climate change, cancer.
-Okay, great. I get it.

1:00:22.578 --> 1:00:24.538
-Pink eye. Instagram.
-What-what about all the stuff

1:00:24.621 --> 1:00:26.248
-that we don’t get to do?
-Like what?

1:00:26.332 --> 1:00:28.250
Like grow up or--
I don’t know-- be an astronaut?

1:00:28.334 --> 1:00:29.752
-Mission specialist.
-Whatever.

1:00:29.835 --> 1:00:31.712
-What about all the things
that I want to be? -

1:00:31.795 --> 1:00:33.547
We’re saying goodbye
to the rest of our lives.

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:36.008
We will never do anything that
takes longer than 16 hours.

1:00:36.091 --> 1:00:38.010
I can get a lot done
in 16 hours.

1:00:38.093 --> 1:00:39.845
MAN:
Hello. You can’t go in there!

1:00:39.928 --> 1:00:41.847
I feel like I’m living
in an Etch A Sketch.

1:00:41.930 --> 1:00:44.016
Everything I do gets undone,
everything I fix

1:00:44.099 --> 1:00:46.518
just gets broken,
and everything that I make--

1:00:46.602 --> 1:00:49.104
-it just disappears.
-MAN: Hey.

1:00:49.188 --> 1:00:51.440
We’re thinking too small. Okay?

1:00:51.523 --> 1:00:54.026
We haven’t even snuck into a zoo
or ridden a Zamboni

1:00:54.109 --> 1:00:55.861
or ghost-ridden
any cool new whips.

1:00:55.944 --> 1:00:57.279
-Oh.
-Hey.

1:00:57.363 --> 1:00:58.906
-Public nudity...
-Margaret.

1:00:58.989 --> 1:01:00.115
-...is always an option.
-Margaret, stop.

1:01:00.199 --> 1:01:01.658
It is. I’m just saying.

1:01:01.742 --> 1:01:03.744
-Oh, thank you.
-Margaret, you’re not listening.

1:01:03.827 --> 1:01:07.247
-What?
-Margaret! Stop.

1:01:07.331 --> 1:01:09.416
This isn’t working.

1:01:10.918 --> 1:01:12.961
Is this ’cause I won’t kiss you?

1:01:14.630 --> 1:01:17.341
Why don’t you just kiss
one of them?

1:01:17.424 --> 1:01:19.385
’Cause I don’t want to.

1:01:28.435 --> 1:01:30.604
Y’all will forget
about this tomorrow.

1:01:40.322 --> 1:01:42.449
-Margaret.
-Come on.

1:01:42.533 --> 1:01:45.160
MARGARET: I have something
to make you feel better.

1:01:45.244 --> 1:01:47.162
I’ve been saving it.

1:01:47.246 --> 1:01:48.914
MARK:
Do people live here?

1:01:48.997 --> 1:01:51.834
MARGARET:
Mm-mm. It’s a show house.

1:01:51.917 --> 1:01:53.669
I guess they use it
to make people, like,

1:01:53.752 --> 1:01:55.587
want to buy one of these.

1:01:58.173 --> 1:02:00.717
Mark.

1:02:00.801 --> 1:02:02.761
It’s perfect.

1:02:02.845 --> 1:02:05.848
-

1:02:07.349 --> 1:02:09.393
Okay. Ready? Oh!

1:02:22.865 --> 1:02:23.907
Whew.

1:02:26.952 --> 1:02:29.746
You know, even before this,

1:02:29.830 --> 1:02:33.709
I always thought there was
something wrong with the world.

1:02:33.792 --> 1:02:37.671
Like, really broken.

1:02:37.754 --> 1:02:39.590
Not fixable.

1:02:40.883 --> 1:02:44.178
But nobody else saw it, so...

1:02:44.261 --> 1:02:47.014
I just walked around pretending
everything was fine.

1:02:48.182 --> 1:02:50.726
And then what happened?

1:02:50.809 --> 1:02:52.519
Nothing. I still feel like that.

1:02:52.603 --> 1:02:55.772
But with you,
I don’t have to pretend.

1:02:58.567 --> 1:03:00.569
I was talking
to my math teacher,

1:03:00.652 --> 1:03:03.780
and he said that we’re

1:03:03.864 --> 1:03:08.577
probably just in a singularity
and if we go far enough,

1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:10.954
like, on a plane...

1:03:12.039 --> 1:03:13.665
...we could get out of it.

1:03:13.749 --> 1:03:16.376
Are you really in
that much of a hurry?

1:03:17.961 --> 1:03:21.423
Like, "Hooray, it’s the future."

1:03:24.551 --> 1:03:29.431
It’s marriage counseling
and global warming

1:03:29.515 --> 1:03:32.643
and colonoscopies and...

1:03:32.726 --> 1:03:35.103
student loans.

1:03:37.356 --> 1:03:38.941
And suddenly you’re 80,

1:03:39.024 --> 1:03:40.692
and you’re waiting
for your Zoloft prescription

1:03:40.776 --> 1:03:42.903
at a Rite Aid
in your sweatpants wondering,

1:03:42.986 --> 1:03:45.197
"Where is that creeping sense
of failure coming from?"

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:48.992
Because it all went by so fast.

1:03:49.076 --> 1:03:51.995
And you never wrote that book,
you know?

1:03:53.539 --> 1:03:56.583
Or kissed that girl or...
went to Paris.

1:03:58.418 --> 1:04:00.212
It’s all over.

1:04:00.295 --> 1:04:03.882
And it wasn’t even
what you wanted.

1:04:03.966 --> 1:04:05.842
I mean, it’s not
gonna be perfect.

1:04:05.926 --> 1:04:08.679
It’s the same stupid crap

1:04:08.762 --> 1:04:11.265
over and over again,
just like in here.

1:04:11.348 --> 1:04:14.184
Yeah, but, I mean,
you don’t actually think

1:04:14.268 --> 1:04:16.520
that this is living, do you?

1:04:16.603 --> 1:04:18.689
We’re stealing people’s lives.

1:04:18.772 --> 1:04:22.901
My dad is-is never gonna finish
his stupid Civil War novel.

1:04:22.985 --> 1:04:24.695
Henry’s never gonna finish
War Fight.

1:04:27.239 --> 1:04:31.159
my sister loses her soccer game

1:04:31.243 --> 1:04:33.912
three to nothing

1:04:33.996 --> 1:04:35.914
every day.

1:04:35.998 --> 1:04:38.500
We have all the time
in the world.

1:04:38.584 --> 1:04:40.085
No, we don’t.

1:04:40.168 --> 1:04:42.337
This is not time.
Time is the stuff that

1:04:42.421 --> 1:04:44.715
when you spend it,
you don’t get it back.

1:04:55.684 --> 1:04:57.311
Okay.

1:05:01.648 --> 1:05:03.859
Um... "okay"?

1:05:07.904 --> 1:05:11.116
Okay, there’s-there’s
a flight to Tokyo

1:05:11.199 --> 1:05:12.868
at 10:00 in the morning.

1:05:13.952 --> 1:05:16.204
Let’s go.

1:05:19.750 --> 1:05:21.501
If this works, our parents
are gonna freak out.

1:05:22.711 --> 1:05:24.046
Why Tokyo?

1:05:24.129 --> 1:05:25.881
I actually don’t think
it matters.

1:05:25.964 --> 1:05:28.175
Just so long as we cross
the international date line,

1:05:28.258 --> 1:05:30.427
it’s automatically tomorrow.

1:05:30.510 --> 1:05:32.971
Though there’s a vending machine
at the airport

1:05:33.055 --> 1:05:34.681
that sells puppies, so...

1:05:34.765 --> 1:05:36.683
I can’t afford puppies.

1:05:36.767 --> 1:05:39.811
I spent like 30 years of
my allowance on these tickets.

1:05:57.954 --> 1:05:59.623
You nervous?
’Cause I checked--

1:05:59.706 --> 1:06:02.084
this flight definitely
does not crash.

1:06:02.167 --> 1:06:04.127
Don’t jinx it.

1:06:06.338 --> 1:06:07.756
You know, if this works,
we’ll technically

1:06:07.839 --> 1:06:09.174
be saving the entire world.

1:06:10.842 --> 1:06:14.596
My sister said that I should
think about other people more,

1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:17.599
so I feel like
saving the entire planet

1:06:17.683 --> 1:06:19.142
is a pretty good start.

1:06:19.226 --> 1:06:20.852
You didn’t cure cancer, though.

1:06:20.936 --> 1:06:23.063
No.

1:06:23.146 --> 1:06:28.360
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to call these eye muffs.

1:06:31.697 --> 1:06:34.366
Although, if you think about it,

1:06:34.449 --> 1:06:36.576
an asteroid could hit
the planet tomorrow.

1:06:36.660 --> 1:06:39.705
Like, maybe that’s why
time started looping.

1:06:39.788 --> 1:06:41.623
Because it’s the last day
before the apocalypse

1:06:41.707 --> 1:06:43.375
and really,
instead of saving the world,

1:06:43.458 --> 1:06:48.171
we’re actually just
destroying it, which would...

1:06:51.133 --> 1:06:54.136
Margaret, are you okay?

1:06:57.264 --> 1:06:59.474
Flight attendants,
prepare doors for departure

1:06:59.558 --> 1:07:00.892
and cross-check.

1:07:13.238 --> 1:07:14.781
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Sir.

1:07:14.865 --> 1:07:16.533
Take your seat
and fasten your seat belt.

1:07:16.616 --> 1:07:18.368
-I, uh... I...
-Please take your seat, sir.

1:07:18.452 --> 1:07:19.911
-Sir, please, sir,

1:07:19.995 --> 1:07:22.247
take your seat
and fasten your seat belt.

1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:38.592
WEATHER REPORTER
You’re going to be looking

1:09:38.675 --> 1:09:40.594
at the rain hitting ground
midnight tonight,

1:09:40.677 --> 1:09:42.137
moving in from the coast.

1:09:42.220 --> 1:09:43.680
We’re not expecting
to have too much...

1:09:43.763 --> 1:09:44.723
Morning, Mark.

1:09:53.023 --> 1:09:54.566
What?

1:09:54.649 --> 1:09:57.819
Thought you were gonna
call me a loser.

1:09:59.070 --> 1:10:00.363
No.

1:10:02.324 --> 1:10:04.743
You were thinking it, though.

1:10:04.826 --> 1:10:06.411
Yeah.

1:10:10.749 --> 1:10:13.168
Hey, Dad, how’s your book going?

1:10:17.547 --> 1:10:20.175
It’s-it’s great.

1:10:20.258 --> 1:10:22.886
I mean, the scope
of the Civil War is just...

1:10:22.969 --> 1:10:24.512
you know, we can’t even
grasp it today.

1:10:24.596 --> 1:10:26.598
Do you know more Americans
died at Spotsylvania

1:10:26.681 --> 1:10:28.308
than on Omaha Beach?

1:10:31.227 --> 1:10:32.812
I... do now.

1:10:32.896 --> 1:10:34.272
As I’ve mentioned,

1:10:34.356 --> 1:10:36.691
smallpox, tuberculosis,
diphtheria--

1:10:36.775 --> 1:10:38.902
the casualties
were unimaginable.

1:10:38.985 --> 1:10:41.571
And the thing is, the war could
have ended so much earlier,

1:10:41.655 --> 1:10:43.406
especially if McClellan
had just pressed through.

1:10:43.490 --> 1:10:44.783
After Antietam...

1:10:44.866 --> 1:10:46.826
-DANIEL: Go, Emma!

1:10:50.789 --> 1:10:52.707
She’s not gonna make it.

1:10:52.791 --> 1:10:54.334
-MAN: Go, go, go, go!
-MAN 2: Go! Cover! Go!

1:11:01.967 --> 1:11:04.636
-Goal!

1:11:12.686 --> 1:11:14.562
WOMAN:
Go, Emma!

1:11:31.204 --> 1:11:33.289
I won!

1:11:33.373 --> 1:11:34.708
-I won!
-

1:12:11.119 --> 1:12:12.078
And Mark again.

1:12:12.162 --> 1:12:14.039
-72.
-That is correct.

1:12:14.122 --> 1:12:15.331
Ah. What’s got into you?

1:12:15.415 --> 1:12:17.417
-On fire today.
-

1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:19.085
Isn’t that a movie where,
like, Bill Murray’s

1:12:19.169 --> 1:12:20.211
stuck in the same day?

1:12:20.295 --> 1:12:21.671
-Groundhog Day.
-Oh!

1:12:32.515 --> 1:12:34.976
-There he is.
-Hey.

1:12:35.060 --> 1:12:37.020
-Good luck.
-

1:12:42.317 --> 1:12:45.153
-Oh! Go for it!
-

1:12:46.738 --> 1:12:48.281
You’re gonna be okay, man.

1:12:48.364 --> 1:12:50.617
This stuff happens all the time.

1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:53.661
So, was that "Tony Hawk,"
like the bird?

1:14:04.941 --> 1:14:07.402
JARED:
I’m just a phone call away.

1:14:56.826 --> 1:14:58.786
Mom.

1:15:02.999 --> 1:15:04.417
HENRY:
And just a...

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:06.002
BOTH:
...little bit of sniper rifle.

1:15:06.085 --> 1:15:07.545
-Oh, oh, you got him on the
left? -I got him on the left.

1:15:07.629 --> 1:15:10.006
-Okay. -Okay, dude, listen.
We’re stuck in a time loop.

1:15:10.089 --> 1:15:12.926
You, me, everybody, same day’s
repeating over and over again.

1:15:13.009 --> 1:15:15.428
-What? -Like in Groundhog Day
and Edge of Tomorrow,

1:15:15.511 --> 1:15:17.222
except only me and this girl
Margaret know about it,

1:15:17.305 --> 1:15:18.848
and we were sort of almost
boyfriend and girlfriend,

1:15:18.932 --> 1:15:20.266
but not really,
and then we broke up,

1:15:20.350 --> 1:15:22.268
and you won’t remember
any of this because your brain

1:15:22.352 --> 1:15:24.270
keeps getting erased.

1:15:24.354 --> 1:15:26.147
Oh.

1:15:26.231 --> 1:15:27.815
Wait, dude,
you had a girlfriend?

1:15:27.899 --> 1:15:29.275
Not really.

1:15:29.359 --> 1:15:31.069
Well, what’s she like?

1:15:31.152 --> 1:15:33.738
She’s amazing.

1:15:33.821 --> 1:15:36.950
She told me this story about
how, when she was a little kid,

1:15:37.033 --> 1:15:38.910
she was always looking for

1:15:38.993 --> 1:15:40.203
the fourth dimension.

1:15:40.286 --> 1:15:43.456
It sounds cheesy,
but when I met her,

1:15:43.539 --> 1:15:45.625
it was kind of like I found it.

1:15:45.708 --> 1:15:47.418
There was just more
to everything

1:15:47.502 --> 1:15:49.796
than I’d ever seen before.

1:15:49.879 --> 1:15:52.548
And there was more to me, too.

1:15:52.632 --> 1:15:56.344
And there always had been.
I just never...

1:15:56.427 --> 1:16:01.015
realized it
until Margaret showed it to me.

1:16:01.099 --> 1:16:03.851
Nah, bro, she sounds amazing.

1:16:03.935 --> 1:16:06.771
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:12.443
Well, if you’re all
fourth-dimensional now,

1:16:12.527 --> 1:16:14.237
how come she dumped you?

1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:16.614
That’s the thing-- I thought
everything was perfect,

1:16:16.698 --> 1:16:19.867
but there was more to the story
than that.

1:16:21.828 --> 1:16:26.165
I thought it was a love story
and I was the hero, but...

1:16:26.249 --> 1:16:28.418
wasn’t about me.

1:16:28.501 --> 1:16:30.503
It wasn’t my story at all.

1:16:35.174 --> 1:16:37.302
It was Margaret’s.

1:17:07.415 --> 1:17:09.500
MARGARET’S MOM:
What are you thinking about?

1:17:12.045 --> 1:17:14.756
Just this boy.

1:17:19.218 --> 1:17:21.346
I messed that up.

1:17:21.429 --> 1:17:23.890
It’s never too late.

1:17:23.973 --> 1:17:26.726
I mean, unless you’re dying
of cancer,

1:17:26.809 --> 1:17:28.770
but not until then.

1:17:36.361 --> 1:17:39.113
MARGARET:
You know, even before this,

1:17:39.197 --> 1:17:42.867
I always thought there was
something wrong with the world.

1:17:42.950 --> 1:17:44.827
Like, really broken.

1:17:48.414 --> 1:17:50.666
You know, not fixable.

1:17:50.750 --> 1:17:52.710
But nobody else could see it.

1:17:54.337 --> 1:17:57.423
So I just walked around
pretending everything was fine.

1:19:35.354 --> 1:19:37.106
Are you Henry?

1:19:38.566 --> 1:19:40.526
I think I can help you.

1:19:40.610 --> 1:19:42.236
-So, you’re a friend of Mark’s?
-Yes!

1:19:43.571 --> 1:19:45.323
Yep.

1:19:45.406 --> 1:19:47.200
That’s funny, because
he never mentioned you.

1:19:48.534 --> 1:19:49.911
Where did you two meet?

1:19:49.994 --> 1:19:51.245
Uh, temporal anomaly.

1:19:53.539 --> 1:19:56.000
Cool. Cool.

1:19:56.083 --> 1:19:58.878
So, if we’re in
a temporal anomaly,

1:19:58.961 --> 1:20:00.880
how many times have we had
this conversation?

1:20:00.963 --> 1:20:03.674
First time.

1:20:03.758 --> 1:20:05.301
Right.

1:20:05.384 --> 1:20:07.428
Okay, so, and...

1:20:07.512 --> 1:20:09.597
what are you doing here?

1:20:09.680 --> 1:20:12.517
MARGARET:
I’m saving your ass, obviously.

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:13.935
HENRY:
And the dog?

1:20:14.018 --> 1:20:15.186
Oh, that’s not my dog.

1:20:15.269 --> 1:20:16.812
His name’s Chewbarka.

1:20:16.896 --> 1:20:18.814
There’s these posters for him
all over town.

1:20:18.898 --> 1:20:21.859
I think he jumped out of a van
on the way to the vet,

1:20:21.943 --> 1:20:24.237
and I’ve been looking
for him forever.

1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:29.325
And then suddenly,
there he was, just like that.

1:20:29.408 --> 1:20:31.786
But it doesn’t matter.

1:20:31.869 --> 1:20:37.416
Because tomorrow, he’ll just
be lost all over again.

1:20:37.500 --> 1:20:40.670
Mark was right-- everything
we fix just gets broken again.

1:20:42.547 --> 1:20:45.299
Okay, so, I don’t understand
what you’re saying...

1:20:45.383 --> 1:20:46.926
Wait. Did you use the shotgun?

1:20:47.009 --> 1:20:48.803
Yeah, you need the grenade
launcher attachment, though.

1:20:48.886 --> 1:20:50.555
-There’s a grenade launcher?
-Yeah.

1:20:52.557 --> 1:20:54.642
-It launches grenades.
-

1:20:54.725 --> 1:20:56.602
Boom!

1:21:00.106 --> 1:21:02.775
I’ve died so many times
doing that.

1:21:02.858 --> 1:21:06.153
Yeah, that’s the thing.

1:21:06.237 --> 1:21:08.573
Death, it’s so terrible.

1:21:08.656 --> 1:21:11.742
So terrible to lose someone.

1:21:11.826 --> 1:21:13.995
And if you don’t face it,

1:21:14.078 --> 1:21:16.247
if you don’t deal with it,
then...

1:21:18.082 --> 1:21:20.543
...you just end up
losing yourself, too.

1:21:22.003 --> 1:21:24.338
Are we still talking
about War Fight?

1:21:26.882 --> 1:21:29.051
Yeah.

1:21:29.135 --> 1:21:31.345
Yeah, you can take it from here.

1:21:37.476 --> 1:21:39.270
HENRY:
Oh, my God.

1:21:39.353 --> 1:21:42.064
It’s the key.

1:21:44.442 --> 1:21:46.402
Whoa, it’s the map.

1:21:47.945 --> 1:21:50.156
I was so lost before,

1:21:50.239 --> 1:21:52.325
but it all makes sense now.

1:21:52.408 --> 1:21:54.535
MARGARET:
Oh, no.

1:21:57.371 --> 1:21:59.415
What?

1:21:59.498 --> 1:22:01.959
It’s something...

1:22:02.043 --> 1:22:04.003
It’s something Mark said.

1:22:08.716 --> 1:22:11.177
I think Mark might have been
right about something.

1:22:11.260 --> 1:22:12.553
That doesn’t sound like Mark.

1:22:12.637 --> 1:22:15.014
No.

1:22:15.097 --> 1:22:16.682
Sorry, I think I have to go.

1:22:16.766 --> 1:22:18.476
-I have to go check something.
-Wait.

1:22:18.559 --> 1:22:19.810
-What?
-Watch Chewbarka.

1:22:19.894 --> 1:22:22.563
eat me last

1:22:22.647 --> 1:22:24.398
I love you.

1:22:25.775 --> 1:22:27.693
-What?

1:22:30.446 --> 1:22:33.658
MARK: Sometimes I feel like,
if I stare at it long enough,

1:22:33.741 --> 1:22:37.328
something will happen, like,
a-almost a pattern or something.

1:22:52.134 --> 1:22:56.681
has changed

1:23:09.193 --> 1:23:11.153
-

1:23:17.535 --> 1:23:21.539
eat me last

1:23:21.622 --> 1:23:25.334
in high contrast

1:23:45.438 --> 1:23:47.982
There’s something missing.

1:23:49.942 --> 1:23:51.986
And it’s time.

1:23:53.195 --> 1:23:54.447
Time.

1:24:36.071 --> 1:24:39.700
eat me last

1:24:39.784 --> 1:24:41.994
in high contrast

1:24:42.077 --> 1:24:43.996
No way.

1:24:53.464 --> 1:24:55.716
There’s one missing.

1:25:01.514 --> 1:25:06.811
has changed...

1:25:10.064 --> 1:25:12.691
Seven...

1:25:22.076 --> 1:25:24.829
7:00 at the pool.

1:25:27.081 --> 1:25:29.208
Pool.

1:25:33.420 --> 1:25:36.298
-MARGARET: You’re up.
-MARGARET’S MOM: Mm.

1:25:36.382 --> 1:25:38.801
MARGARET:
Are you okay?

1:25:38.884 --> 1:25:41.679
It’s a relative term.

1:25:45.933 --> 1:25:48.727
I thought we’d have
so much more time.

1:25:48.811 --> 1:25:50.354
I know.

1:25:50.437 --> 1:25:53.190
But you will be all right.

1:25:57.528 --> 1:25:59.488
I don’t know.

1:26:01.115 --> 1:26:03.909
I don’t know if I can do this.

1:26:03.993 --> 1:26:05.452
MARGARET’S MOM:
Listen to me,

1:26:05.536 --> 1:26:10.958
because I’m old
and I know things.

1:26:11.041 --> 1:26:13.085
It’s true that
we’re losing time every day,

1:26:13.168 --> 1:26:14.420
all the time,

1:26:14.503 --> 1:26:16.213
until one day it’s all gone.

1:26:17.298 --> 1:26:18.716
But you’re gaining it, too.

1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:21.260
Every second,

1:26:21.343 --> 1:26:24.597
perfect moments,
one after the other,

1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:27.474
until, by the end,
you have your whole life.

1:26:29.184 --> 1:26:31.478
You have everything.

1:26:31.562 --> 1:26:34.481
And it costs you everything.

1:26:35.524 --> 1:26:37.484
But it’s worth it.

1:26:40.112 --> 1:26:43.532
I promise that it’s worth it.

1:26:54.043 --> 1:26:55.628
You’re still here.

1:27:01.550 --> 1:27:03.093
Uh...

1:27:34.458 --> 1:27:37.628
The plane thing didn’t work.

1:27:41.340 --> 1:27:43.634
You were right
about the map, though.

1:27:43.717 --> 1:27:45.344
There is a pattern.

1:27:45.427 --> 1:27:48.138
It’s just not finished yet.

1:27:48.222 --> 1:27:50.099
There’s one more perfect moment.

1:27:50.182 --> 1:27:51.475
Right.

1:27:53.102 --> 1:27:55.270
I will keep a lookout.

1:27:56.647 --> 1:27:58.732
MARGARET: I’m serious.
I think that there’s one more

1:27:58.816 --> 1:28:00.192
and that’s the key,

1:28:00.275 --> 1:28:02.027
and once we find it, that’s it.

1:28:02.111 --> 1:28:03.278
-It’s all over.
-

1:28:03.362 --> 1:28:06.031
Margaret, I...

1:28:06.115 --> 1:28:08.242
saw you go to the hospital.

1:28:12.162 --> 1:28:15.082
I’m...

1:28:15.165 --> 1:28:17.459
not gonna...

1:28:17.543 --> 1:28:20.045
try and take you away from her.

1:28:20.129 --> 1:28:22.047
I can’t do that.

1:28:32.891 --> 1:28:35.227
Before this all happened,
I went to go see her,

1:28:35.310 --> 1:28:38.063
and they told me that
it was her time,

1:28:38.147 --> 1:28:40.441
that it was over.

1:28:40.524 --> 1:28:43.277
And that night, all I could
think about was that

1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:45.446
tomorrow can’t come yet;
I’m not ready.

1:28:45.529 --> 1:28:47.865
I’m not ready to not have a mom.

1:28:51.493 --> 1:28:54.079
I just wanted time to stop.

1:28:58.625 --> 1:29:01.795
And it worked.

1:29:01.879 --> 1:29:03.505
Mm-hmm.

1:29:07.384 --> 1:29:09.762
-Yeah.
-

1:29:11.472 --> 1:29:14.183
And I was so happy about it.

1:29:14.266 --> 1:29:17.311
I just wanted to stay
in that moment, you know?

1:29:19.354 --> 1:29:21.482
And then the really weird thing
was that you showed up,

1:29:21.565 --> 1:29:23.317
and I didn’t know
where you came from

1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:25.569
and why it was you, and...

1:29:25.652 --> 1:29:28.697
and, um, now I think I know why.

1:29:28.781 --> 1:29:32.159
I think it’s because, you know,
when it’s time to go,

1:29:32.242 --> 1:29:34.411
I wouldn’t have to go alone.

1:29:37.039 --> 1:29:38.415
Okay.

1:29:39.833 --> 1:29:41.877
And it’s time.

1:29:43.420 --> 1:29:45.380
And it’s not gonna be perfect.

1:29:45.464 --> 1:29:47.925
You know, we’re never gonna
find the fourth dimension

1:29:48.008 --> 1:29:50.469
or cure cancer or fix the world.

1:29:50.552 --> 1:29:53.430
The point is,
is that I was wrong.

1:29:56.683 --> 1:29:58.602
We’re the ones sleeping.

1:29:58.685 --> 1:30:02.022
Everyone else is awake,
and it’s just us dreaming.

1:30:03.315 --> 1:30:05.818
I know it’s gonna hurt
really bad...

1:30:07.653 --> 1:30:09.947
...but I think that
I have to wake up now.

1:30:13.283 --> 1:30:16.036
I think that this is the moment.

1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:17.955
Right now.

1:30:18.038 --> 1:30:19.998
And I don’t want to miss it.

1:30:28.590 --> 1:30:30.717
That was kind of perfect.

1:30:32.219 --> 1:30:33.971
There was a hair in my mouth.

1:30:37.766 --> 1:30:39.726
Kiss me again?

1:31:42.664 --> 1:31:44.833
Goodbye, Mom.

1:32:11.526 --> 1:32:13.737
MARK:
You ready?

1:32:15.489 --> 1:32:17.074
MARGARET
I don’t know.

1:32:57.698 --> 1:33:00.325
-

1:34:46.807 --> 1:34:48.934
-

1:34:56.525 --> 1:34:59.111
to 1992

1:35:06.785 --> 1:35:10.789
to 1992

1:35:34.771 --> 1:35:38.692
to 1992

1:35:44.573 --> 1:35:48.827
to 1992
