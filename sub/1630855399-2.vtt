31:25.050 --> 31:27.970
Chavez's black ops team
as a weapon.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.973
- To what end?
- To eliminate
the triad's competition.

31:31.056 --> 31:34.977
To consolidate power
for one Mexican cartel,

31:35.060 --> 31:36.812

the Silver Lotus to use

31:36.895 --> 31:39.398
that cartel's infrastructure
for their own benefit.

31:39.481 --> 31:42.943

the merging of cartels?

far worse than drugs.

This is about them
creating an open market.
