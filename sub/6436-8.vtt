WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:09.423
(theme music playing )

00:28.779 --> 00:30.735
(thunder crashing )

00:32.825 --> 00:34.326
(yelling)

01:02.939 --> 01:05.021
(laughing)

01:14.158 --> 01:16.319
( Batiatus laughing )

01:52.488 --> 01:54.399
Yes!

02:00.705 --> 02:01.911
Spartacus!

02:03.833 --> 02:05.289
Victor again!

02:07.128 --> 02:10.666
( crowd chanting )
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

02:10.840 --> 02:13.547
(yells)

02:13.718 --> 02:17.381
It's a marvel good Solonius
has any men left.

02:18.514 --> 02:20.505
Must the Thracian appear
in every primus?

02:20.683 --> 02:24.722
Does the house of Batiatus not deem
another gladiator worthy of spectacle?

02:24.895 --> 02:26.226
They have no one else of note.

02:26.397 --> 02:28.683
Crixus will return to glory presently.

02:28.858 --> 02:31.691
- As you say.
- A welcome addition.

02:33.029 --> 02:36.521
I grow tired of seeing this Thracian
and his victories.

02:36.699 --> 02:39.532
Perhaps something of note
to erase the tedium.

02:41.162 --> 02:44.029
I purchase a fresh batch of slaves
at auction tomorrow,

02:44.206 --> 02:46.743
to be trained as gladiators.

02:46.917 --> 02:51.035
We would be honored if you would
grace us at the unveiling.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.205
What sort of beasts
shall you procure?

02:54.383 --> 02:56.419
Only the most ferocious,

02:56.594 --> 02:59.381
to be displayed for your pleasure.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.630
Auctioneer:
...females.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.799
We'll begin again with the males.

03:04.977 --> 03:07.559
Quickly quickly,
make way.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.142
Hurry up.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.853
Our next auction is about to begin.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.063
Patrons of Capua, please gather.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.398
Fortune favors us--

03:17.573 --> 03:20.781
a fine selection,
enough coin to take our pick.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.737
Your competitor approaches.

03:24.455 --> 03:28.118
Solonius, my heart brims with joy.

03:28.292 --> 03:32.251
I had hoped to see you here, buying new
men for Spartacus to slaughter.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.797
Batiatus,

03:33.964 --> 03:36.421
now purse-proud
and so potent with charm.

03:36.592 --> 03:39.925
How quickly Fortuna shifts
her blessings, huh?

03:40.096 --> 03:42.803
A fact that beloved Ovidius was
unexpectedly made aware of.

03:42.973 --> 03:46.136
You speak truth.
His murder was a deep tragedy.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.050
Indeed.
One can never know

03:48.229 --> 03:50.345
who is plotting violence,
can one?

03:50.523 --> 03:52.059
Or when they may commit the act.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.020
- Auctioneer: Good citizens of Capua...
- The auction begins, Dominus.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.684
To business then.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.944
Auctioneer: Behold the finest offering
of flesh and bone...

03:59.115 --> 04:01.777
The Gaul Segovax will demand expense,

04:01.951 --> 04:04.363
and perhaps the German brothers

04:04.537 --> 04:06.744
Duro and Agron.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.530
- The others?
- Of |itt|e worth.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.495
Let us begin with a Celtic Gaul

04:12.670 --> 04:15.207
of imposing virtues.

04:15.381 --> 04:18.373
I give you Segovax,

04:18.551 --> 04:20.337
skin-- his armor,

04:20.511 --> 04:22.718
hands-- his steel.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.379
Who would claim such a man?

04:25.558 --> 04:27.219
Bid.

04:27.393 --> 04:30.351
- Five denarii.
- Five denarii from good Vibius.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.933
10 denarii.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.473
33353â€”35:

04:35.651 --> 04:36.936
20.

04:38.988 --> 04:40.819
25 denarii.

04:41.824 --> 04:44.861
I grow tired of bidding.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.411
100 denarii.

04:46.579 --> 04:48.786
(crowd murmuring)

04:48.956 --> 04:50.821
- Woman: 100?
- 100?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.456
For the entire lot.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.207
Sold to Batiatus,

04:54.378 --> 04:55.834
savior of Capua.

04:56.005 --> 04:59.088
( applause )

04:59.258 --> 05:01.089
With respect, Dominus,

05:01.260 --> 05:04.127
your coin far exceeds their value.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.761
Fuck value.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.516
that cock-eater's pride
ground beneath my heel.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.678
Solonius, consider the whores.

05:15.483 --> 05:18.145
Perhaps you will have better fortune
fighting women in the arena.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.685
( crowd laughs )

05:20.863 --> 05:22.945
(grunting)

05:50.726 --> 05:53.638
Have I not pleased you, Domina?

05:54.813 --> 05:58.647
Does your cock stand dry?

06:00.319 --> 06:03.436
I fear you have not quaked.

06:03.614 --> 06:06.606
Apologies.

06:07.785 --> 06:09.946
My wounds have yet to fully heal.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.829
Well, you will recover
and all will be as it was.

06:14.959 --> 06:17.291
( Naevia clears throat )
Forgive me.

06:17.461 --> 06:20.498
Dominus returns from the market.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.581
Get out.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.505
What would you have me do?

06:31.684 --> 06:34.551
lfl refuse,
Domina will grow suspicious.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.889
I know.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.230
I perform as weakly as I can,

06:43.404 --> 06:45.565
hoping she will lose interest.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.403
lam not angry with you.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.489
It's only...

06:54.248 --> 06:55.909
| find it difficult

06:56.083 --> 06:59.541
that you and Domina share
what we have not

06:59.712 --> 07:01.623
for some time.

07:07.011 --> 07:10.469
You alone occupy my thoughts.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.769
( gates squeak, close )

07:28.699 --> 07:29.529
You're gonna die! You're gonna die!
You're gonna die!

07:29.533 --> 07:31.899
You're gonna die! You're gonna die!
You're gonna die!

07:33.078 --> 07:34.818
I'm gonna kill you.
You're dead.

07:34.997 --> 07:38.034
I'm gonna kill you. You're dead.
You're dead.

07:38.208 --> 07:41.200
Yeah, you're dead. You're all dead.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.980
What is beneath your feet?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.192
Sand.

08:07.363 --> 08:08.523
(chuckling)

08:08.697 --> 08:11.154
Fucking idiot.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.531
Spartacus.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.367
Sacred ground, Doctore,

08:19.541 --> 08:21.668
watered with tears of blood.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.952
Your tears. Your blood.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.416
Your pathetic lives,
forged into something of worth.

08:27.591 --> 08:30.048
Five denarii
on the fool who spoke.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.130
Listen. Learn.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.589
And perhaps live

08:33.764 --> 08:35.220
as gladiators.

08:35.391 --> 08:38.554
Now attend your master.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.593
Batiatus:
You have been blessed,

08:41.772 --> 08:44.184
each and every one of you,

08:44.358 --> 08:46.815
to find yourselves here

08:46.985 --> 08:50.352
at the ludus
of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus,

08:50.531 --> 08:53.273
purveyor of the finest gladiators
in all of the republic.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.827
( cheering )

08:55.994 --> 08:58.371
Prove yourselves
in the hard days to follow.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.281
Prove yourselves more than
a common slave,

09:01.458 --> 09:04.370
more than a man.
Fail and die.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.661
Your husband speaks as my father would
before the senate.

09:06.839 --> 09:10.752
- He's quite the orator.
- The tongue of Apollo.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.462
Batiatus:
Succeed

09:12.636 --> 09:15.343
and stand proud among my titans!

09:15.514 --> 09:18.426
Batiatus! Batiatus! Batiatus!

09:21.353 --> 09:22.934
( gasps )

09:23.105 --> 09:26.017
A gladiator does not fear death.

09:27.192 --> 09:31.310
He embraces it, caresses it, fucks it.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.571
- Each time he enters the arena...
- What make you of the new men?

09:34.742 --> 09:36.653
Doctore: ...he slips his cock
into the mouth...

09:36.827 --> 09:39.739
They are spectacles.

09:39.913 --> 09:45.704
| find myself growing quite fond of this
sordid business of gladiators.

09:45.878 --> 09:48.210
Perhaps you should consider purchasing
one of your own.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.087
A gladiator? I could never.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.216
Doctore:
Listen. Learn.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.343
Could I?

09:57.514 --> 10:00.847
Choose a recruit and he is yours--
for a nominal fee, of course,

10:01.018 --> 10:04.010
such funds to cover the expense
of his upkeep and his training.

10:05.022 --> 10:09.391
Every victory in the arena
is an honor to his domina.

10:09.568 --> 10:13.277
Doctore: The only thing that does
is the sound of my voice.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.312
Who should I choose?

10:15.491 --> 10:17.573
Doctore:
The sand beneath your feet--

10:17.743 --> 10:19.859
May I offer a suggestion
to aid your dilemma?

10:20.037 --> 10:22.369
- Doctore: You will learn to worship it.
- Doctore.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.457
Our honored guest wishes to assess
the recruits' virtus.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.415
( men laugh )

10:33.133 --> 10:34.669
Remove your cloths!

11:02.663 --> 11:04.654
| wish to alter my bet--

11:04.832 --> 11:08.575
everything on the one
with the horse cock.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.913
The one on the left.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.329
Segovax, the Gaul.

11:13.507 --> 11:17.876
He has truly been blessed
by the god Priapus.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.590
Batiatus: A fine specimen.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.880
We must celebrate.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.017
See to the wine.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.098
Has a man ever had such a wife?

11:29.273 --> 11:31.935
She but loves her husband
and would see him elevated.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.611
llithyia: A gladiator of my own,

11:37.781 --> 11:41.399
mined from the same lands
as Crixus.

11:41.577 --> 11:44.410
The envy of my friends
shall spread like locusts,

11:44.580 --> 11:46.036
their hearts devoured.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.663
Who would you torture so?

11:48.834 --> 11:50.825
No one of my acquaintance, I hope.

11:51.003 --> 11:55.042
Doubtful. Caecilia, Aemilia,

11:55.215 --> 11:57.752
Licinia.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.791
Licinia, cousin to Marcus Crassus?

11:59.970 --> 12:03.133
The wealthiest man in Rome,
according to him at least.

12:03.307 --> 12:06.014
Licinia in particular enjoys the games,

12:06.184 --> 12:08.561
more so the beasts
who do battle in them.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.890
You must make invitation
for a private introduction

12:11.064 --> 12:13.146
to your man Segovax
here at the villa.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.182
These are proper Roman women.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.568
They only mingle with families
of equal standing.

12:18.739 --> 12:21.902
Perhaps it's for the best.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.659
Seeing your man in the flesh
would only inflame their envy.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.576
I will arrange it.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.665
And I shall even help you
with your hair.

12:35.839 --> 12:40.333
We must make you look suitable
for such elevated company.

12:44.348 --> 12:47.886
Shit baking in the sun.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.847
Seems only yesterday
we were of a similar position.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.603
Much has changed.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.516
You became the fucking champion
of Capua,

12:56.693 --> 12:59.605
your myth to echo
for a thousand years.

12:59.780 --> 13:00.986
And |...

13:01.156 --> 13:02.942
Became a good friend.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.823
Varro, the dice call your name.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.866
And Varro answers.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.831
You continue to gamble?

13:14.002 --> 13:16.664
A few coins to pass the time.

13:20.926 --> 13:25.215
You fucking wait until gladiators
have filled their bellies.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.973
Crixus, let them eat.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.100
They must embrace
pain and suffering

13:32.270 --> 13:34.010
to become gladiators.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.145
This is how it is done.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.520
Not by you.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.111
Let them eat.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.953
( chuckles )

13:53.375 --> 13:55.366
Spartacus,

13:55.544 --> 13:57.751
the kind and gentle one.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.786
( laughter)

14:03.677 --> 14:05.633
Do not mistake me, Crixus.

14:07.139 --> 14:11.257
I give no shit about these men.

14:11.435 --> 14:14.268
But you are no longer

14:14.438 --> 14:17.271
the champion of Capua.

14:17.441 --> 14:20.524
You do not take lead here.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.185
You follow.

14:39.921 --> 14:44.540
The man who follows
is forever at your back--

14:44.718 --> 14:47.004
something to consider, champion.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.768
Fucking Gauls.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.896
Much gratitude.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.479
Men should not die
with empty stomachs.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.574
( men and women grunting )

15:14.372 --> 15:16.408
Rhaskos.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.699
Mm, end of the month already?

15:18.877 --> 15:21.243
According to the calendar
you cannot read.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.537
Your winnings amount
to three and a half denarii.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.580
Preserve
coin or indulge yourself.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.045
When do I ever take coin
overgash?

15:28.220 --> 15:30.882
I expect her ass to be returned
free of blood.

15:39.523 --> 15:44.108
Ashur, you pass my cell
by mistake.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.814
Where is my coin?

15:51.368 --> 15:54.656
The mistake is yours.
You do not fight--

15:54.830 --> 15:57.913
you are entitled to neither coin
norcunt

15:59.334 --> 16:01.416
The dominus shall hear about this.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.417
Oh,

16:03.588 --> 16:05.795
his very hand set the names.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.878
Perhaps next month you should
find yourself again among them,

16:09.052 --> 16:11.338
should your wounds ever heal.

16:14.266 --> 16:17.178
Ashur: Varro, a moment.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.640
( sighs ) Your victories amass
much coin.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.430
Shall I see it transferred to your wife
as usual

16:23.608 --> 16:25.724
Ol'...

16:25.902 --> 16:28.860
would you prefer a small portion

16:29.030 --> 16:32.943
applied towards more
pressing concerns?

16:33.118 --> 16:35.279
( men and women grunting )

16:54.598 --> 16:57.886
That tiny man is the fucking
champion of Capua?

16:58.059 --> 17:00.391
Fucking Romans swell his legend
to their advantage.

17:00.562 --> 17:03.850
- We could easily best the man, Agron.
- Spartacus defeated Theokoles

17:04.024 --> 17:06.140
and the skies wept
to honor his victory.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.811
The two of you would present challenge
equal to piss and shit.

17:10.989 --> 17:14.948
(laughing)

17:16.328 --> 17:18.114
You find my words amusing?

17:18.288 --> 17:19.824
Your words-- no.

17:19.998 --> 17:23.536
The stupid fuck that speaks them--
very fucking amusing.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.292
Segovax: Spartacus is a man
to be held as an example.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.579
The slave ignites the arena.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.499
One day the flames
shall set him free.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.292
l've witnessed such a thing--

17:34.471 --> 17:37.304
the roar of the crowd
demanding a gladiator

17:37.474 --> 17:39.760
be granted freedom
for his showing in the arena.

17:39.935 --> 17:42.176
You haven't even earned the mark
of the fucking brotherhood

17:42.354 --> 17:45.141
- and you cluck about freedom.
- Segovax is right.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.306
Spartacus shows us the way.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.229
I will train as he trains,

17:50.403 --> 17:53.770
every thrust and counter
committed to memory.

17:53.949 --> 17:56.110
And one day

17:56.284 --> 17:59.196
I too will become a legend
in the arena.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.210
(yells)

18:25.981 --> 18:27.937
(spits)

18:35.448 --> 18:37.939
His wounds need yet more time.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.949
How much longer?

18:40.120 --> 18:42.406
A fortnight or two, perhaps three.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.411
Jupiter's cock.

18:44.582 --> 18:47.995
Man: His recovery may be aided
by certain herbs

18:48.169 --> 18:50.501
absent the apothecary.

18:52.924 --> 18:56.587
Dominus, I've been without sword
for too long.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.093
Let me resume training.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.882
I will see
all on the list procured.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.800
Heed medicus's warning.

19:05.979 --> 19:09.096
Your sword will return to your hand
soon enough.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.356
Ashur: Mandragora, henbane, lye,

19:11.526 --> 19:15.235
thorn apple, hemlock, belladonna,
half a dozen more--

19:15.405 --> 19:17.441
substantial lists
requiring substantial coin.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.401
Batiatus: Procure the highest quality.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.487
Ashur: Ajustified expense,
should remedy result.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.199
May the gods see it fucking so.
Too many days pass without progress.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.705
When Doctore suffered a wound
from Theokoles,

19:27.876 --> 19:29.958
did they require equal time
in the healing?

19:30.128 --> 19:32.835
Considerably less.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.748
There might be a blessing
hidden among such a curse.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.632
Talk of Crixus's true condition
surely has not escaped

19:38.803 --> 19:41.510
beyond these walls... yet.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.512
Your meaning?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.174
Inquiries for his purchase could be made
in a delicate fashion.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.890
My visit to the market
could serve dual purpose.

19:50.732 --> 19:54.099
Remove the thought.
There'll be no talk of selling Crixus.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.438
| only fear for the future,
Dominus--

19:56.613 --> 19:59.150
one that does not see Spartacus
erased from it.

19:59.324 --> 20:02.361
Straighten your fucking tongue
and speak plainly.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.322
Yesterday I witnessed the hatred
Crixus cultivates towards Spartacus

20:05.497 --> 20:07.158
grow beyond measure.

20:07.332 --> 20:10.665
If in his mad passion Crixus were
to make attempt on his life...

20:10.835 --> 20:13.087
Batiatus: Solicit numbers
from Sextus Vibius alone.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.461
Word of Crixus's stunted recovery
must not spread.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.999
| wish only to discover
his current value.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.667
You would sell Crixus?

20:25.183 --> 20:27.094
I would explore
all avenues of reason.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.055
Which has flown
if you consider such a thing.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.515
Crixus will fight again.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.305
But will he ever be
the man he was?

20:34.484 --> 20:36.349
Give him time to heal,
Quintus.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.564
He bleeds when pierced,
as does any man.

20:38.738 --> 20:42.071
The crowds do not see a man. They see
a god, and we present him as such.

20:42.242 --> 20:45.484
Should that myth evaporate,
so goes his worth.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.404
Then we'll find worth
in another role.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.243
Surely his knowledge would aid
instruction to the lower men.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.909
We already have a doctore,
the finest in any ludus.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.294
He could work beside you then.

20:56.464 --> 20:59.501
Crixus has no head for numbers.
The sword is his only purpose.

20:59.676 --> 21:02.088
He's part of the family, Quintus.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.594
He is a fucking slave.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.177
This house, this family
is a business, Lucretia.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.967
As much regret results from selling
a gladiator like Crixus,

21:11.146 --> 21:13.933
when the time arrives,
and it fucking will for them all,

21:14.107 --> 21:16.189
it's a necessity
that must be swallowed.

21:19.070 --> 21:22.608
No decision has yet been made.
He may still prove himself fit.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.068
Turn your mind towards llithyia
and her friends.

21:25.243 --> 21:29.737
Win their favor
and see this family rise ever higher.

21:51.352 --> 21:52.637
Good.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.973
But you lower your shield
when you thrust.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.230
It leaves you open
from shoulder to neck.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.981
Again.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.143
Naevia: Crixus.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.649
What are you doing?

22:04.824 --> 22:07.361
Doctore's gaze misses nothing.

22:07.535 --> 22:10.322
A risk made necessary
by unfortunate events.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.156
Has something
happened to you?

22:15.335 --> 22:17.826
I am ever safe.
But Dominus--

22:18.004 --> 22:20.370
he considers selling you
to another master.

22:22.217 --> 22:23.423
You're mistaken.

22:23.593 --> 22:26.551
Ashur has been sent to market
for herb...

22:29.474 --> 22:32.807
and to question Vibius
on his interest towards you.

22:34.062 --> 22:36.644
Vibius--

22:36.814 --> 22:39.476
a master of shits and mongrels.

22:39.651 --> 22:42.063
The glory l have earned this ludus--

22:42.237 --> 22:43.818
this is my fucking reward.

22:43.988 --> 22:48.197
Crixus, you must prove to Dominus
that your time has not passed.

23:00.088 --> 23:03.000
Doctore: To step onto the sand
as a gladiator

23:03.174 --> 23:06.507
is the highest position
a slave can pray for.

23:06.678 --> 23:09.841
Prove you rselves.

23:10.014 --> 23:12.346
Earn the mark of the brotherhood.

23:16.354 --> 23:18.219
You strike a solid blow

23:18.398 --> 23:21.561
against an ill-trained fool
who taints the name of Gaul.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.236
He may be a fool,

23:26.406 --> 23:28.522
but he is one who is fit to train.

23:29.534 --> 23:30.944
Again.

23:31.119 --> 23:33.701
You doubt that I am fully healed?

23:33.871 --> 23:35.657
'Cause I will show you otherwise.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.993
Doctore, Crixus offers
a demonstration

23:41.170 --> 23:43.582
to the benefit of the recruits.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.041
Shall I indulge?

23:46.676 --> 23:48.962
He believes himself ready.

23:49.137 --> 23:51.128
As do |.

23:53.182 --> 23:56.720
Segovax, your sword and shield.

24:03.276 --> 24:05.267
Attend!

24:13.995 --> 24:16.077
Man: Show him
who's champion, Crixus.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.739
Show me.

24:36.809 --> 24:40.267
Spartacus: He attacks boldly

24:40.438 --> 24:42.554
to hasten victory...

24:45.652 --> 24:47.859
counter to proper training.

25:02.543 --> 25:06.661
Spartacus: Defeat is delivered
not only by the sword,

25:06.839 --> 25:09.672
but also the crowd.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.754
Fall from their grace,

25:12.929 --> 25:15.636
and you may never rise
to former glories.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.061
A true gladiator

25:32.240 --> 25:35.778
is taught to embrace
pain and suffering...

25:38.329 --> 25:41.492
to fight until life flees
from his worthless body.

26:11.112 --> 26:13.899
Learn from this man

26:14.073 --> 26:15.938
or share his fate.

26:17.452 --> 26:20.034
Batiatus: Spartacus.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.320
Return to training.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.908
Dominus.

26:30.423 --> 26:34.712
Doctore: Rhaskos, Hamilcar,

26:34.886 --> 26:37.252
see him to the medicus.

26:48.316 --> 26:49.601
A fine offer, good Vibius.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.768
I shall hasten to present it
to my master.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.856
A moment, slave.

26:55.031 --> 26:58.364
You frequent the market
absent Batiatus?

26:59.494 --> 27:03.112
l conduct important business
on his behalf.

27:03.289 --> 27:06.452
Regarding the former champion
of Capua?

27:06.626 --> 27:09.413
I discuss no business
of the like.

27:09.587 --> 27:13.250
Oh, I would,
if found in your position.

27:13.424 --> 27:17.042
Crixus is champion
in name only.

27:17.220 --> 27:20.212
He is but limbs
dangling from a skewered trunk.

27:20.389 --> 27:24.632
Your master would be well served
pawning him off on a toad like Vibius.

27:26.103 --> 27:29.345
Your concern for my master
is well received.

27:29.524 --> 27:31.640
My concern is not for him

27:31.818 --> 27:34.275
but about him.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.822
- ( coinsjingle)
- Are your ears receptive?

27:42.245 --> 27:45.533
I cannot stop a free man
from speech.

27:45.706 --> 27:49.699
Were Batiatus to seek reprisal
for offenses he believes l have made,

27:49.877 --> 27:52.163
I would wish warning
in advance.

27:57.009 --> 28:00.342
lam a villain.

28:01.681 --> 28:05.299
But I'm not your villain.
Seek another slave.

28:05.476 --> 28:08.468
Loyalty can become
a crushing weight,

28:08.646 --> 28:12.855
if not braced
by proper support.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.812
When your back
begins to break,

28:15.987 --> 28:21.027
you'll find my shoulders
broad and welcoming.

28:26.247 --> 28:28.989
Spartacus: You overreach.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.543
And here is the result.

28:31.711 --> 28:34.544
Do not address me
as you would a recruit.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.545
Then do not act like one.

28:36.716 --> 28:40.049
Words of import
from the mighty Spartacus,

28:40.219 --> 28:42.255
bringer of rain,

28:42.430 --> 28:44.796
slayer of Theokoles.

28:44.974 --> 28:48.341
As if you stood against him
on your own.

28:48.519 --> 28:51.306
Without my aid

28:51.480 --> 28:53.471
you would have nothing,

28:53.649 --> 28:56.482
not even your miserable life.

28:56.652 --> 28:58.563
True.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.820
But here I stand.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.151
And there you sit.

29:03.326 --> 29:06.284
You know shit
about being a champion,

29:06.454 --> 29:09.821
of being a true brother.

29:09.999 --> 29:13.366
You are only playing
at your own part.

29:13.544 --> 29:16.911
And one day
the game will end.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.674
Death comes to us all.

29:26.849 --> 29:29.340
Press me again,

29:29.518 --> 29:31.930
and you shall find yours.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.477
(women laughing )

29:37.485 --> 29:38.099
(women laughing )

29:38.277 --> 29:41.895
Lucretia: Gratitude forjoining us
this evening at the house of Batiatus.

29:42.073 --> 29:45.531
Indeed llithyia has spoken
so very highly of you

29:45.701 --> 29:47.612
that I feel as if
I'm with old friends.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.823
Well, that's a disadvantage.

29:49.997 --> 29:51.533
llithyia neglected to mention

29:51.707 --> 29:54.084
she was acquainted
with the wife of good Batiatus.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.991
I am sure I must have.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.331
She is quite the bitch,
if you have not noticed.

29:58.506 --> 30:00.462
Which is why we love her so.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.589
I grow rather fond of her myself.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.500
Mm, I could use a cup of wine
to wet the tongue.

30:04.679 --> 30:06.544
You could be drowning
and gurgle the same.

30:08.349 --> 30:10.806
- Mm, is this Sestian?
- Philonian.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.639
Mm, she is trying hard,
is she not?

30:13.813 --> 30:15.895
Only because I have told her
how important you are to me.

30:16.065 --> 30:18.932
Yes, we all love each other
and have orgies under the new moon.

30:19.110 --> 30:20.475
Now tell us stories.

30:20.653 --> 30:23.690
Yes, tell us everything
about this horrid place.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.241
She means the ludus below.

30:26.409 --> 30:29.071
- Do I need an interpreter?
- Apparently.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.860
Do be quiet.
Let her speak.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.903
How do you live
among such beasts?

30:33.082 --> 30:35.744
My husband sees them
well tamed.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.874
I pray not fully.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.787
- Licinia.
- Some instinct remains,

30:40.965 --> 30:44.002
so that they may yet unleash
their savagery in the arena.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.963
I would go insane here,
surrounded by all these animals,

30:47.138 --> 30:48.924
high atop this mountain.

30:49.098 --> 30:51.430
Would you not prefer
to live in the city,

30:51.600 --> 30:53.977
surrounded by real people?

30:56.022 --> 30:58.684
I find that we are
perfectly located.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.019
I need only step out
onto my balcony

31:01.193 --> 31:03.525
and all of Capua
kneels at my feet.

31:03.696 --> 31:04.936
Well stated.

31:05.114 --> 31:08.572
But are you not bored
up here, all alone,

31:08.743 --> 31:11.234
nothing but slaves
and beasts,

31:11.412 --> 31:14.074
not even children
to occupy--?

31:15.374 --> 31:16.750
Boredom?

31:16.917 --> 31:20.910
Impossible with so many
distractions.

31:21.088 --> 31:24.125
I stay quite occupied.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.507
Each day brings with it
opportunity.

31:26.677 --> 31:27.962
Yesterday, in fact,

31:28.137 --> 31:30.719
six new recruits
began their training,

31:30.890 --> 31:33.347
one of whom fights
under llithyia's patronage.

31:34.977 --> 31:37.810
llithyia, Claudius
gave you approval?

31:37.980 --> 31:39.345
He does not know.

31:39.523 --> 31:42.139
(snickering )

31:42.318 --> 31:45.731
A few coins
parceled from my allowance.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.566
He will kill you when he finds out.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.197
And I will kill the first who tells,
Caecilia.

31:50.367 --> 31:54.326
Mm, a gladiator of your own.
May we see him?

31:54.497 --> 31:57.409
Of course
he's not yet a gladiator.

31:57.583 --> 32:01.542
He must pass the final test
before he earns the mark of Batiatus.

32:01.712 --> 32:04.044
Oh, so he is only a slave then?

32:05.716 --> 32:08.093
Oh, for the time being, but--

32:08.260 --> 32:10.376
I would lay eyes
upon a real gladiator.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.803
Yes.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.351
A champion.
Bring Spartacus up.

32:16.519 --> 32:20.808
Spartacus?
Oh yes, you must.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.895
Bring up the champion.

32:26.070 --> 32:30.154
Let us all revel in his presence.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.623
Gratitude--

32:41.794 --> 32:44.581
for your aid in my training today.

32:48.342 --> 32:51.334
I would be eager to hear any advice

32:51.512 --> 32:53.503
to further my cause.

32:53.681 --> 32:56.548
Your cause?

32:56.725 --> 32:59.592
Victories in the arena

32:59.770 --> 33:01.681
and freedom.

33:03.566 --> 33:08.026
Forsake any thoughts of freedom

33:08.195 --> 33:11.437
and the life you once had
beyond these walls.

33:11.615 --> 33:14.607
Accept your fate

33:14.785 --> 33:19.028
or be destroyed by specters
of a past never to return.

33:19.206 --> 33:22.198
Spartacus, you are summoned.

33:25.629 --> 33:29.713
Mm, he stands as Mars,
ready for war.

33:35.806 --> 33:37.922
Is there truth to the legends?

33:38.100 --> 33:40.341
Gladiators share
the blood of the gods?

33:40.519 --> 33:42.601
The mighty Crixus--
most certainly.

33:42.771 --> 33:46.104
There was a man
truly blessed by the gods.

33:46.275 --> 33:48.106
When will we see him
in the arena again?

33:48.277 --> 33:50.188
Soon.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.148
What of you, Spartacus?

33:52.323 --> 33:54.314
Are you a blessing to us?

33:54.491 --> 33:56.948
To some.

33:57.119 --> 33:59.576
To others a curse.

33:59.747 --> 34:02.363
A duality of his kind--

34:02.541 --> 34:04.532
admired as a gladiator,

34:04.710 --> 34:06.951
yet despised as a slave.

34:07.129 --> 34:09.461
He is much more
than a common slave.

34:09.632 --> 34:12.715
You can feel it radiating
from his flesh.

34:12.885 --> 34:16.878
I have heard tale of a champion's blood
possessing many restorative powers.

34:17.056 --> 34:21.846
A few drops in a glass of wine
is said to make a man hard for days.

34:22.019 --> 34:24.055
Lucretia:
Such are the legends.

34:24.230 --> 34:27.188
Well, I would test them
for myself if I could.

34:27.358 --> 34:30.145
Certainly.
I'll send a messenger with a vial.

34:30.319 --> 34:32.230
I would have it now.

34:39.078 --> 34:41.194
May I have the honor?

34:46.502 --> 34:49.460
Take care not to cut
too deeply.

34:49.630 --> 34:54.090
The legend does call for the blood
of a dead gladiator, does it not?

34:54.260 --> 34:57.548
But such details
should not concern us.

34:57.721 --> 35:01.680
Spartacus will die soon enough...

35:02.977 --> 35:06.219
to the roar of the crowd.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.698
I do not believe he will ever fall
in the arena.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.526
He is a god among men.

35:18.701 --> 35:20.532
He's nothing but a Thracian dog.

35:20.703 --> 35:22.694
His treachery dishonored Rome.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.577
It is your husband
who bears the dishonor.

35:24.748 --> 35:25.954
Guards.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.332
He abandoned defenseless
women and children,

35:28.502 --> 35:30.083
left them
to be raped and murdered.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.370
Get him out of here.

35:32.548 --> 35:34.834
- What a bold tongue.
- Apologies.

35:35.009 --> 35:37.091
Were he my slave,
lwould have him crucified.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.384
For what?
Speaking the truth?

35:42.558 --> 35:45.265
We've all heard the rumors
about your husband.

35:49.690 --> 35:53.023
The hour grows late,
and I'm expected.

35:53.193 --> 35:57.106
Gratitude for a most
interesting evening.

35:57.281 --> 35:59.818
And one that begs
a repeat soon.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.369
(snickering )

36:08.459 --> 36:10.620
Apologies.

36:10.794 --> 36:12.955
None required.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.542
You will soon learn
that women of note

36:15.716 --> 36:18.549
have a rabid taste for the embarrassment
of their friends.

36:18.719 --> 36:20.880
Well, I would not see mine
treated so.

36:24.141 --> 36:28.009
May I have words with Segovax
before I take my leave?

36:28.187 --> 36:31.930
I wish to bid my man good fortune
in the days to follow.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.313
( dice rattle )

36:33.484 --> 36:36.317
-( laughing )
- Fuck.

36:36.487 --> 36:39.729
Varro: Ah, my fortune returns.

36:39.907 --> 36:42.865
( laughs)

36:43.035 --> 36:45.321
Varro.

36:45.496 --> 36:48.579
I'm of a winning mind.
Save your words of caution.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.705
I'm not here for words.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.491
I'm here for dice.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.079
You and dice?

36:54.254 --> 36:56.040
I am of a mood tonight.

36:56.215 --> 36:58.706
I would have distraction
and coin.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.552
The rules then.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.680
Should I need instruction,
I shall ask.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.386
(laughing)

37:10.979 --> 37:13.186
(laughing)

37:25.536 --> 37:27.322
Leave us.

37:29.373 --> 37:31.910
Do you know who I am, slave?

37:32.084 --> 37:34.666
Apologies.

37:35.671 --> 37:37.161
I do not.

37:38.424 --> 37:41.632
I am your domina.

37:41.802 --> 37:45.215
My coin pays for your training,

37:45.389 --> 37:47.926
water, food,

37:48.100 --> 37:50.386
the very air you breathe.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.891
Survive to receive the mark,

37:55.065 --> 37:58.353
and you will become my gladiator,

37:58.527 --> 38:01.109
my champion.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.359
Domina.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.404
Please me,

38:11.582 --> 38:14.915
and the rewards
will be substantial--

38:15.085 --> 38:19.203
wine, women,

38:19.381 --> 38:22.919
even freedom perhaps.

38:23.093 --> 38:25.755
You desire such a thing--

38:25.929 --> 38:27.465
freedom?

38:27.639 --> 38:30.972
Yes, Domina.

38:33.437 --> 38:36.144
There is something I desire.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.806
See it attended to,

38:38.984 --> 38:41.851
and your freedom will be secured.

38:44.615 --> 38:44.694
Spartacus should never
have been summoned.

38:44.698 --> 38:46.859
Spartacus should never
have been summoned.

38:47.034 --> 38:48.820
I had little choice.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.110
llithyia and the man
should be kept separate.

38:51.288 --> 38:54.155
Throwing them together
invites calamity.

38:54.333 --> 38:57.040
The risk bore fruit.

38:57.211 --> 38:59.167
Licinia intimates another visit.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.829
Spartacus her purpose?

39:02.007 --> 39:03.918
Undoubtedly.

39:04.092 --> 39:08.176
Then we shall accommodate.

39:08.347 --> 39:12.181
Her cousin good Crassus
owns the fucking heavens,

39:12.351 --> 39:15.559
even if he is not currently favored
by his fellows in the senate.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.680
Your efforts raise us
ever higher.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.525
And how do yours fare?

39:23.695 --> 39:26.027
Have you received offers for Crixus?

39:26.198 --> 39:27.529
I meet Vibius tomorrow.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.530
Vibius?

39:29.701 --> 39:31.953
His ludus is in Damascus.

39:32.120 --> 39:35.408
Crixus will fare better in the smaller
venues until he is healed.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.750
Well, tomorrow then.

39:40.921 --> 39:42.912
His glory fades.

39:43.090 --> 39:45.923
I would not have it extinguished
beneath my roof.

39:48.303 --> 39:51.261
Damascus?

39:51.431 --> 39:54.173
Dominus meets with Vibius
tomorrow.

39:54.351 --> 39:57.559
I've never seen Damascus.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.937
Do you think I'll like it?

40:03.360 --> 40:05.646
You cannot go.

40:05.821 --> 40:08.858
The decision is made.

40:09.032 --> 40:12.445
Even Domina doubts me.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.201
I see it in her eyes.

40:17.833 --> 40:20.745
Then convince her otherwise.

40:23.630 --> 40:26.793
My words carry no weight.

40:29.177 --> 40:31.884
I do not speak of words.

40:38.312 --> 40:40.678
You would have me do this?

40:43.233 --> 40:45.519
I would have you stay.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.542
The coin you lost to me.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.499
Which makes it yours.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.755
You are a fool.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.961
You have thrown dice before.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.468
I turned from such things
years ago

41:13.639 --> 41:15.470
for my wife.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.011
You are a better man than I.

41:19.186 --> 41:21.928
- Do not forget why you are here, Varro.
- Remove your hand.

41:22.105 --> 41:24.437
You dishonor your family.
You dishonor your own wife.

41:24.608 --> 41:26.269
My wife is a whore.

41:33.075 --> 41:35.441
She carries another man's child.

41:48.882 --> 41:50.292
How did this come to be?

41:50.467 --> 41:53.209
A friend from the marketplace.

41:53.387 --> 41:55.503
She claims he forced
his way onto her, but--

41:55.681 --> 41:57.717
- And you find fault with her?
- She did not fight.

41:57.891 --> 42:01.133
Had you not left to pay your debts,
she would not have had to.

42:04.898 --> 42:07.435
She lives, Varro.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.941
She lives.

42:10.112 --> 42:14.105
You may yet hold her
in your arms--

42:16.451 --> 42:19.158
a thought a decent man
would cherish.

42:38.598 --> 42:41.385
My husband is at market
on business concerning you.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.852
He believes your day
may have passed.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.443
And you?

42:50.610 --> 42:53.397
I pray he is mistaken.

42:56.533 --> 42:59.240
And your gods--

42:59.411 --> 43:03.245
do they answer your prayers?

43:03.415 --> 43:05.872
They're silent.

43:15.135 --> 43:19.048
Then let us crack open
the heavens

43:19.222 --> 43:22.589
and gain their attention...

43:26.396 --> 43:28.512
remove any doubt

43:28.690 --> 43:31.682
that my day has passed.

43:31.860 --> 43:35.819
(moaning)

43:51.588 --> 43:53.920
She seemed pleased.

43:54.090 --> 43:57.833
- Naevia.
- You did what you had to,

43:58.011 --> 44:00.002
what I asked of you.

44:04.059 --> 44:06.425
Dominus is already at market,

44:06.603 --> 44:09.219
speaking with Vibius.

44:09.397 --> 44:12.264
There is nothing
that cannot be undone.

44:12.442 --> 44:14.933
You are a good man, Crixus.

44:15.111 --> 44:17.272
The gods will not see you
treated so.

44:17.447 --> 44:20.564
They now favor Spartacus.

44:22.244 --> 44:25.111
They give no shit for me.

45:29.436 --> 45:32.394
Forgive me, champion.

46:09.851 --> 46:14.891
You'd kill a fellow Gaul

46:15.065 --> 46:17.397
to save a man you hate?

46:18.401 --> 46:21.734
I did not save Spartacus.

46:21.905 --> 46:26.148
I saved a brother
who shares the mark.

46:35.001 --> 46:38.789
You have earned a glorious death

46:38.964 --> 46:41.376
and will die at the hands
of a gladiator.

46:46.346 --> 46:49.213
I leave these walls
for a fucking moment

46:49.391 --> 46:51.632
and a recruit tries
to kill Spartacus,

46:51.810 --> 46:53.926
llithyia's own fucking man?

46:54.104 --> 46:57.312
And he would have succeeded,
if it weren't for Crixus.

46:57.482 --> 46:59.188
His day's not past.

46:59.359 --> 47:01.600
Oh fuck!

47:01.778 --> 47:03.769
Send a note to Vibius.
Crixus is no longer for sale.

47:03.947 --> 47:07.280
Oh, I fear the terms are already
agreed upon.

47:07.450 --> 47:09.532
Well, fuck the terms!
Should he have issue,

47:09.703 --> 47:11.989
he can reason to my cock.

47:12.163 --> 47:14.575
( footsteps )

47:14.749 --> 47:17.786
Ah, the snake arrives,
walking as if human.

47:19.254 --> 47:21.666
I pray I have not missed
the test.

47:21.840 --> 47:24.172
Delayed due to most
unfortunate events.

47:24.342 --> 47:28.551
Spartacus, the champion of Capua,
was attacked unawares in the baths.

47:28.722 --> 47:30.929
Attacked?

47:31.099 --> 47:34.057
By your recruit-- Segovax.

47:34.227 --> 47:37.594
How unfortunate.

47:37.772 --> 47:40.388
For your man-- yes.

47:40.567 --> 47:43.900
He had to be punished, of course.

47:44.070 --> 47:46.527
- ( metal clanging )
- ( Segovax screaming )

48:01.296 --> 48:03.127
Spartacus yet lives.

48:03.298 --> 48:05.710
Yet.

48:11.181 --> 48:13.547
Your man would not speak
as to his reason,

48:13.725 --> 48:15.886
even when parted from his cock.

48:27.197 --> 48:29.279
He gave you no sign of cause

48:29.449 --> 48:31.110
when you met with him
last night, did he?

48:31.284 --> 48:34.447
No. It is a mystery.

48:46.007 --> 48:49.625
lwill regain my position,
champion.

48:49.803 --> 48:52.169
And I welcome the attempt.

48:58.812 --> 48:58.846
(theme music playing )

48:58.853 --> 49:01.265
(theme music playing )
