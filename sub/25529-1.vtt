All aboard!

01:54.364 --> 01:56.740
Train departs in five minutes!

02:56.133 --> 02:58.969
Are you Annie Hargraves?

03:00.930 --> 03:02.974
Daughter of Stefan Hargraves?

03:05.852 --> 03:09.394
I don't know who that is.

03:09.396 --> 03:12.066
I have a bodyguard escorting
me on this train ride.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.236
He's the best
mercenary in Georgia.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.280
He'll be here any
moment now, and he won't

03:20.282 --> 03:21.700
hesitate to blow your head off.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.977
I told you not to
talk to strangers Annie.

03:56.610 --> 03:59.613
Annie, that's a lovely name.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.117
You look just like your father.

04:09.081 --> 04:10.417
I'm Jericho Whitfield.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.292
And why don't you
head to the back

04:14.294 --> 04:15.671
of the train where you belong?

04:17.507 --> 04:20.466
Last
call to Atlanta!

04:20.468 --> 04:21.302
Last call!

04:24.471 --> 04:30.351
You know what, okay I'll
leave you nice people be.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.105
Doors are closing!

04:34.440 --> 04:41.154
Last call to Atlanta, last call!

04:41.156 --> 04:42.531
Doors are closing!

04:44.826 --> 04:46.995
I suggest you leave
that package here too.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.040
And what if I don't?

04:52.291 --> 04:57.795
Well, I would say we
have ourselves a situation.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.389
I'll say, that we do.

05:10.851 --> 05:11.767
Make a run for it.

05:11.769 --> 05:12.726
Best through the dining car.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.856
Now you listen up,
you listen up real good.

05:59.858 --> 06:01.776
My name is Roland Bursley, once

06:01.778 --> 06:04.529
a rebel captain,
now a mercenary.

06:04.531 --> 06:08.449
Now payday motivates me Jericho,
that girl you're tracking,

06:08.451 --> 06:10.493
I don't care if
she lives or dies,

06:10.495 --> 06:12.077
but the reason why
we're in this scrimmage

06:12.079 --> 06:14.579
is because her
daddy's paying me $500

06:14.581 --> 06:15.957
to get her safely
from here to Atlanta.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.375
Then you're in
my way mercenary.

06:24.591 --> 06:25.591
Jericho Whitfield, is
that your name right?

06:25.593 --> 06:28.301
It sho is.

06:28.303 --> 06:29.846
We can end this here
and right now.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.723
You hop your ugly
ass off this train.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.350
I won't follow you.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.521
I don't intend to
lose that $500.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.110
Pays for that.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.488
Yeah, you just give
me Annie Hargraves

06:48.490 --> 06:52.536
so I can scalp and kill
her with this here knife.

06:55.874 --> 06:59.334
And then you can take me
to the Atlanta authorities

06:59.336 --> 07:02.297
and collect your $1,000
bounty on my head.

07:07.343 --> 07:12.348
Roland, we got
ourselves a bargain?

07:58.560 --> 08:01.521
Let me go, please.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.147
Just a minute.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.108
There you go Jericho,
one Ms. Annie Hargraves,

08:06.110 --> 08:08.112
now remember, be quick about it.

08:09.447 --> 08:14.409
If I were you I'd step aside.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.118
Pleasure during
business with you.

08:16.120 --> 08:20.125
Mm-hmm.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.086
I was bait.

08:26.088 --> 08:28.880
Yeah,
now don't talk to me

08:28.882 --> 08:30.507
for the rest of the
train ride all right.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.634
I'm here for a payday, not
to have a conversation.

08:38.225 --> 08:40.225
Desi he's getting
the floor awful dirty.

08:40.227 --> 08:41.979
Can you get a rag
and clean that up?

08:46.109 --> 08:49.401
Yes Ms. Grace.

08:49.403 --> 08:50.987
They'll
be a lot more blood

08:50.989 --> 08:53.739
to clean up after I break free.

08:53.741 --> 09:00.787
Shut up.

09:00.789 --> 09:03.833
We will keep him on this
train 'til we get to Atlanta.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.794
And I will escort him
safely to the cattle post.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.173
He will get a safe trial.

09:09.673 --> 09:10.507
Then you'll hang.

09:23.855 --> 09:24.896
Come on.

09:24.898 --> 09:29.235
Nah you, you stay.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.739
It's a bitter pill
ain't it, living a slave.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.787
Come with us, I
need eyes on Jericho.

09:41.789 --> 09:47.001
He ain't liable to
hurt his own kind.

09:47.003 --> 09:47.836
Go.

09:56.261 --> 09:57.096
Sit.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.099
You sit too.

10:07.023 --> 10:12.028
Now, the bad news is,
I'm not gonna kill you.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.406
The good news is, I'm
gone be a thousand dollars

10:17.408 --> 10:20.785
richer when we get to Atlanta.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.786
Holler if he tries
anything funny.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.747
I'm gonna be over here.

10:29.169 --> 10:30.004
Culture.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.971
I thought you had your
bounty to worry about.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.013
Jericho ain't going nowhere.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.517
And what if he breaks
free and shoots me dead?

10:44.852 --> 10:46.812
Then I guess
I'll be 500 short.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.940
See you in Atlanta.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.816
Don't bother me.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.251
What's your name?

11:11.462 --> 11:12.296
Desdemona.

11:13.505 --> 11:14.341
A lovely name.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.801
I don't talk to
crazy criminals.

11:19.803 --> 11:21.762
I'm simply a
minister of justice

11:21.764 --> 11:25.434
to those who would
have us in chains.

11:28.937 --> 11:30.772
We have the same scars.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.820
You should help me Desdemona.

11:38.822 --> 11:41.283
We're on the same side, look.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.318
Enough of you Mr. Jericho.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.153
How long did that
white lady own you for?

12:20.155 --> 12:22.781
Grace's daddy owned
me for 30 years.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.868
Grace owned me for three,
but I'm a free woman now.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.244
She pays me a fair wage.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.622
You'll always be her slave.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.133
What are you doing with a
little girl's corn husk doll?

12:45.889 --> 12:47.556
Who's is it Jericho?

13:28.015 --> 13:29.641
I told you not to bother me.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.650
I thought I told
you to stay put.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.151
Thought you were in trouble.

15:04.153 --> 15:08.031
How did you expect
to get me out of it?

15:08.033 --> 15:09.033
Ah.

15:14.163 --> 15:18.835
I have a deal that I'd like
to propose to you Desdemona.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.132
Why would I strike
a deal with you?

15:27.427 --> 15:30.011
Because I can give you
something that you want.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.267
Untie me, let me
go, let me finish

15:37.269 --> 15:43.065
what I came on this train to do.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.568
I can also throw in
Ms. Grace for you.

15:48.155 --> 15:52.157
I'll scalp her and kill
her, on your behalf.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.825
No blood on your hands.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.462
You'll never have to
hang you head low again.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.052
Can you get a rag
and clean that up.

16:12.054 --> 16:15.180
Desdemona shut your mouth,
Desdemona shut your mouth.

16:26.610 --> 16:29.237
I won't let you
kill Ms. Grace.

16:33.618 --> 16:34.533
And I won't be an accomplice to

16:34.535 --> 16:36.828
that poor Annie girl's murder.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.502
Well that's a damn shame Desi.

16:46.798 --> 16:49.757
I thought that we
would make a good team.

16:49.759 --> 16:54.679
Now you're just a coward,
standing in my way.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.314
Okay, I'm not gonna kill you,

17:05.316 --> 17:07.400
I'm not gonna kill you,
it's just gonna me a little.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.657
Shit, I suggest you hide.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.834
That's my gun.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.295
You're not stopping me.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.048
Stay down mercenary.

17:37.348 --> 17:40.682
I see you Annie Hargraves.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.061
Let me tell you a story.

17:43.229 --> 17:50.151
Your daddy used to
own me and my family.

17:50.153 --> 17:57.909
Myself, my wife, and
my beloved daughter.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.828
He was feared
throughout Atlanta,

18:01.373 --> 18:05.833
for scalping slaves who had
the audacity to run away.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.711
One day we decided
we had enough.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.713
And we staged a little
rebellion of our own.

18:11.715 --> 18:15.176
Killed all the
overseers, but yo daddy,

18:15.178 --> 18:17.469
he went out and he
got some more men

18:17.471 --> 18:21.599
and put an end to that
little rebellion party.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.063
I had to watch as my
daughter was scalped

18:26.647 --> 18:31.401
and her bloody body was
thrown into a muddy ditch.

18:31.403 --> 18:35.822
And from that moment
on, I have scalped 48

18:35.824 --> 18:39.411
slave owners and
their next of kin.

18:40.744 --> 18:45.750
From the moment I saw my
baby girl bleeding out

18:47.419 --> 18:52.424
in that ditch, I made
a promise to myself,

18:53.924 --> 18:57.678
to find and scalp the first
born of Master Stefan Hargraves.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.985
You have my daughter's eyes.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.374
Thought I took care of you.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.294
You know what, hold this.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.467
Father don't
let them kill me.

19:37.469 --> 19:38.343
Father don't let them kill me.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.344
Father don't let them kill me.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.429
What the hell is that?

19:41.431 --> 19:43.096
Don't let
them kill me Father.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.646
Don't
let your guard down.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.899
When he comes back
we'll be ready.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.374
Bad dream Father?

21:15.567 --> 21:19.443
Help me,
there's something wrong.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.612
Why didn't you help me?

21:23.490 --> 21:25.490
Do something Mama.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.119
Do something Mama.

21:41.843 --> 21:45.761
Jericho won't scalp
me, not as weak as I look.

21:45.763 --> 21:49.056
You ever used a blade?

21:49.058 --> 21:50.518
Once.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.524
You do it like
this, hold it tight.

22:00.028 --> 22:00.862
Here,

22:01.863 --> 22:03.155
here,

22:04.699 --> 22:06.532
here.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.953
Strike one of those if you
want to bleed a man out.

22:15.794 --> 22:17.584
If you kill me,
you'll lose that

22:17.586 --> 22:20.131
$1,000 bounty on my live head.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.510
You're quite the
mercenary Roland.

22:26.387 --> 22:29.514
Oh what, you gonna waste
your bullet on little old me?

22:29.516 --> 22:30.890
Yeah why not?

22:30.892 --> 22:32.975
Because there might
be something scarier

22:32.977 --> 22:34.977
than the both of us
on this damn train.

22:34.979 --> 22:39.273
Something that can kill us
before we can kill each other.

22:41.986 --> 22:45.822
Why don't we do some
investigation together, shall we?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.213
Who are you?

23:54.558 --> 23:57.226
The other passengers
need to see this.

23:57.228 --> 24:00.606
Go 'head, go ahead and
get that chair there.

24:09.199 --> 24:10.033
You, sit.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.709
Who is
that, I thought we

24:22.711 --> 24:24.506
were the only ones
on this train.

24:27.342 --> 24:29.969
I'm staring at the face
of a Yankee I killed in '62.

24:31.805 --> 24:34.766
This man has been
dead for 10 years.

24:36.643 --> 24:39.562
But he don't look so dead now.

24:45.693 --> 24:47.820
What I want to know is, why?

24:49.321 --> 25:02.917
A Yankee, is that
all I was to you Roland?

25:02.919 --> 25:05.420
So you came all this
way, under the dirt

25:05.422 --> 25:06.756
and trails to just say hello.

25:09.634 --> 25:10.468
Hi.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.139
Did your coffin get
uncomfortable for you?

25:17.599 --> 25:19.642
You know I didn't
get no coffin.

25:27.443 --> 25:28.442
I didn't expect that.

25:45.045 --> 25:45.879
Sellah?

25:49.548 --> 25:53.718
You are not Sellah,
I know you're not her.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.054
All I ever wanted Grace, was

25:56.056 --> 25:58.680
for you to call me your sister.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.935
She's
got a nigger sister.

26:03.730 --> 26:06.021
I'm guessing her daddy
had his way with Desi

26:06.023 --> 26:09.400
whenever he wanted, whether
she wanted to or not.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.694
Left you with a precious
little half sister.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.792
I cared
about you Roland.

26:40.642 --> 26:46.603
Do something Mama.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.356
You're not my daughter.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.609
You're a monster.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.737
Help me.

26:54.739 --> 26:56.488
My daughter
died eight years ago.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.117
Why
didn't you help me?

27:11.964 --> 27:14.757
Be a good girl
Annie Hargraves.

27:14.759 --> 27:16.049
You don't talk to her.

27:21.724 --> 27:24.100
I am not your
good little girl!

27:25.894 --> 27:27.311
Get off me Roland, get off.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.398
Get outta here now!

27:30.150 --> 27:32.360
We're gonna make you talk.

27:36.030 --> 27:43.452
You look human, I'm gonna
see if you die like one too.

27:43.454 --> 27:44.788
You let go of those chairs

27:48.917 --> 27:50.294
the ropes cut this trigger

27:51.921 --> 27:53.882
and this gun will blow
your head clean off.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.764
The last guy I did this to, he
lasted a good three minutes.

28:04.476 --> 28:05.352
How long you got?

28:14.361 --> 28:15.195
What are you?

28:16.363 --> 28:17.780
What the hell do
you want with us?

28:29.166 --> 28:30.583
I'ma make this a
little hard for you.

28:34.506 --> 28:35.796
Now you were saying?

28:37.800 --> 28:39.801
You could
have spared me.

28:39.803 --> 28:40.884
I was your...

29:02.491 --> 29:04.411
I'm gonna ask you
this one more time.

29:06.371 --> 29:08.328
What the hell are you?

29:26.598 --> 29:28.932
No Jericho, Jericho
that ain't her,

29:28.934 --> 29:29.892
now just don't let her move.

29:29.894 --> 29:31.184
Get away from me!

29:31.186 --> 29:32.519
Oh no, I don't
mean you any harm.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.021
I can't believe anything that

29:34.023 --> 29:35.523
comes out of your mouth Jericho.

29:35.525 --> 29:37.065
You're a monster.

29:37.067 --> 29:40.111
No, you didn't marry a
monster, you married me.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.696
You took it too far.

29:41.698 --> 29:44.073
I just did what everybody
else was too weak to do.

29:44.075 --> 29:45.949
You killed women and children,

29:45.951 --> 29:47.660
you're a monster, a monster.

29:47.662 --> 29:48.827
Shut up!

29:48.829 --> 29:50.078
Monster.

29:50.080 --> 29:50.912
What ever you
think you're holding

29:50.914 --> 29:51.875
in that thing ain't her.

29:53.417 --> 29:57.004
Jericho, if you still
love me you'll let me go.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.923
No, Jericho, Jericho
it ain't your wife.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.008
Get your
hands off my wife.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.134
Get away from her!

30:06.890 --> 30:12.727
Jericho,
Jericho what are you doing?

30:12.729 --> 30:14.146
I didn't know you were so soft.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.521
To find that Jericho Whitfield

30:16.523 --> 30:18.690
turned you into
a blubbering mess

30:18.692 --> 30:20.942
over a bitch who didn't
even want him anyway.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.112
You're pathetic.

30:33.791 --> 30:35.709
You're not who you
look like are you?

30:38.253 --> 30:39.673
What are you?

30:41.298 --> 30:42.174
You the devil?

30:44.719 --> 30:46.844
I work for him.

30:54.019 --> 30:58.105
You don't even have anyone,
hell you don't even love.

30:58.107 --> 31:01.025
They're be nobody to mourn
for you at your funeral.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.151
Hell there won't
even be a funeral.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.447
You just as soon
as killed that girl

31:06.449 --> 31:10.410
for $500 as well as protect her.

31:10.412 --> 31:13.996
Well do you enjoy it,
working for the devil?

31:13.998 --> 31:15.208
I didn't at first.

31:17.126 --> 31:21.336
But you grow to enjoy
the power over people.

31:21.338 --> 31:26.176
You're a mercenary Roland,
that's all you'll ever be.

31:30.472 --> 31:32.180
What does it feel like?

31:38.022 --> 31:40.023
I can show you if you like.

31:46.865 --> 31:48.113
You're
right about me,

31:48.115 --> 31:50.033
but we have to kill that thing.

32:01.755 --> 32:03.465
If you want to get
off this train,

32:05.633 --> 32:08.010
we're gonna have to
kill each other later.

32:22.232 --> 32:23.609
Get away from her.

32:36.247 --> 32:38.083
Can I get a moment
of your time Father?

32:41.126 --> 32:42.211
What do you want
from me Jericho?

32:44.422 --> 32:48.298
I saw my wife, she
left me years ago

32:48.300 --> 32:49.635
when I became a killer.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.013
I just want to confess my sins.

32:58.103 --> 32:59.142
You're wondering who that was

32:59.144 --> 33:00.728
back there aren't you?

33:00.730 --> 33:03.648
The silver haired man,
the shape shifter.

33:03.650 --> 33:05.694
No, you don't have
to tell me nothing.

33:13.535 --> 33:15.495
My husband was
murdered last month.

33:16.663 --> 33:18.205
Authorities said
Indians killed him.

33:19.415 --> 33:21.750
So my father hired
you to escort me home.

33:25.713 --> 33:28.797
My father looked
all over the state

33:28.799 --> 33:30.175
for a suitable husband for me.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.305
The best match he found
was a man from Delmar.

33:35.807 --> 33:40.977
Nathaniel Hickson.

33:40.979 --> 33:44.439
I moved into his house
after the wedding.

33:44.441 --> 33:45.940
My father made me promise that I

33:45.942 --> 33:47.943
would try to make it work out.

33:49.570 --> 33:53.532
Then one night, he
wanted me in his room.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.493
But I didn't want to,

33:58.496 --> 34:00.373
but he wouldn't back down.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.587
He told me to be a good girl.

34:11.885 --> 34:16.889
So I took a lamp and I smashed
him in the back of the head.

34:17.724 --> 34:20.266
And when he was on the ground,

34:20.268 --> 34:24.105
I took a piece of glass
and I cut his throat,

34:26.315 --> 34:28.273
ear to ear like a cow.

34:53.134 --> 34:56.971
Everybody on this
train is wallowing in guilt.

34:58.139 --> 34:59.847
And all I can think
about is getting

34:59.849 --> 35:04.769
my hands on Annie
Hargraves scalp.

35:04.771 --> 35:07.979
Does that make me a sinner?

35:07.981 --> 35:11.527
People only confess their sins

35:13.612 --> 35:15.155
when they want to be redeemed.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.282
Is that what you want?

35:37.971 --> 35:42.391
Look at you, are you a new
man with restored faith now?

35:43.809 --> 35:45.853
You mind if I have a
word with Ms. Hargraves?

36:02.454 --> 36:05.204
And just so you
know it, I won't

36:05.206 --> 36:06.246
be taking my eyes off you.

36:06.248 --> 36:07.623
If you go for the
silver little knife

36:07.625 --> 36:09.460
of yours I will blow
your brains out.

36:26.478 --> 36:29.773
I can scalp you
and have my revenge

36:31.358 --> 36:33.651
or let you live and
choose a noble path.

36:48.166 --> 36:49.834
I'd like to show you something.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.628
Whoa now, keep your
hands where I can see 'em.

36:53.630 --> 36:54.463
It's not.

36:56.132 --> 36:57.507
Show me what you got there.

36:57.509 --> 36:59.050
You got a weapon in there?

36:59.052 --> 37:01.469
Move away from Annie.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.304
Let me take care
of this Roland.

37:03.306 --> 37:05.389
You won't do what
needs to be done.

37:05.391 --> 37:11.269
Is that right?

37:11.271 --> 37:17.818
Now you're gonna tell
me what is in the bag.

37:33.253 --> 37:36.378
The reason I
kill crackers like you.

39:39.920 --> 39:45.383
Oh hey, hey, it's okay.

39:45.385 --> 39:47.927
All right let go, you're
wrinkling my suit.

39:53.268 --> 39:56.561
How are you still alive?

40:01.358 --> 40:02.191
Oh, oh.

40:30.221 --> 40:33.891
Sinners, when
you boarded my train,

40:34.976 --> 40:37.394
you left the immortal world.

40:39.396 --> 40:42.523
You have arrived in my kingdom

40:42.525 --> 40:45.650
and entered into the
life full of despair.

40:45.652 --> 40:48.403
Sinners, when you
boarded my train,

40:48.405 --> 40:50.491
you are all dead, my train.

40:55.538 --> 40:57.662
You have reached my kingdom.

42:21.458 --> 42:22.831
Annie get
back on the train.

42:22.833 --> 42:29.546
I wanted to see
Hell for myself.

42:29.548 --> 42:33.887
What did a woman like
you, do to be sent to Hell?

42:37.014 --> 42:37.848
I did nothing.

42:39.059 --> 42:41.728
Oh we all did something.

42:44.563 --> 42:48.692
Grace sold my daughter to a
slave master, a cruel master.

42:50.070 --> 42:52.572
She was always
jealous of Sellah.

42:53.989 --> 42:56.325
Well you should have
strangled Grace then and there.

42:59.329 --> 43:01.581
I was too scared
to stand up to her.

43:03.833 --> 43:05.749
Didn't say a thing.

43:05.751 --> 43:07.751
I was practically Grace's mama.

43:07.753 --> 43:12.130
I raised her since she was born.

43:12.132 --> 43:13.425
Coulda saved my girl.

43:15.762 --> 43:17.764
Her new master beat
her 'til she died.

43:20.224 --> 43:23.603
And that day they sold her,
Sellah begged me to save her.

43:25.521 --> 43:29.483
Convince Grace to
let me stay Mama.

43:32.903 --> 43:36.532
But I was too afraid,
that's why I'm damned.

43:37.867 --> 43:38.993
'Cause I did nothing.

43:44.666 --> 43:48.711
Passengers, you
can still choose your path.

43:52.923 --> 43:56.883
Pass like us and you
can bargain with me

43:56.885 --> 43:59.845
for the fate of your soul.

44:08.106 --> 44:10.523
I won't be
a sitting duck, I will

44:10.525 --> 44:14.735
not await damnation
on that cursed train.

44:14.737 --> 44:18.280
Satan cannot judge
me, I'm a man of God.

46:32.541 --> 46:33.374
Oh!

46:41.467 --> 46:42.300
No.

47:06.867 --> 47:09.746
I'm here for
your pleasure, lover.

47:11.748 --> 47:14.956
I forgive you for what you did.

47:14.958 --> 47:16.543
I made you break your vows.

47:19.047 --> 47:21.546
Do you want to kill me?

47:21.548 --> 47:22.759
I tempted you.

47:24.260 --> 47:25.387
I understand.

48:47.844 --> 48:51.845
No, no, no!

49:00.981 --> 49:02.523
No!

49:58.164 --> 50:00.748
Welcome passengers,

50:00.750 --> 50:02.666
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

50:02.668 --> 50:04.126
Yeah, why not?

50:05.295 --> 50:07.088
You'll take your test,

50:07.090 --> 50:10.133
hell's armies will
be on your side

50:10.135 --> 50:14.637
and make you cry,
like the priest.

50:14.639 --> 50:16.722
The first test is simple.

50:18.309 --> 50:21.351
Choose whoever you want gone
amongst the five of you.

50:21.353 --> 50:25.148
The person you believe
most deserves damnation.

50:27.318 --> 50:29.446
Write it on this slip of paper.

50:30.822 --> 50:34.159
Whoever you have chosen
will be taken away.

50:35.534 --> 50:41.204
Everyone else will go on
to the next challenge.

50:56.347 --> 50:58.764
Everyone,
write down Jericho.

50:58.766 --> 51:01.184
No, we each write
our own names.

51:01.186 --> 51:02.309
That's the only way
to make it fair.

51:02.311 --> 51:05.313
Shut your mouth Desdemona.

51:05.315 --> 51:07.898
Tell me, who has made the lives

51:07.900 --> 51:10.693
of every person on
this train miserable?

51:10.695 --> 51:14.613
Who is the most vile and
repulsive murderer on this train?

51:18.744 --> 51:20.954
Has hurt every last one of us.

51:22.206 --> 51:26.293
He's a rebellious slave
who doesn't know his place.

51:27.711 --> 51:32.548
You are a disgusting, vile,

51:33.385 --> 51:34.592
mangy, nigger.

51:38.556 --> 51:40.224
Know your place girl.

51:44.396 --> 51:47.604
We will all write our own names.

51:47.606 --> 51:50.191
Everyone'll have
a fighting chance.

51:50.193 --> 51:52.193
And that's the way it's gone be.

52:21.099 --> 52:22.932
Who will
pick the name?

52:22.934 --> 52:24.391
I will.

53:11.273 --> 53:12.565
Desdemona.

53:18.155 --> 53:19.363
It says Desde...

53:42.639 --> 53:46.057
You thought she'd be redeemed?

53:46.059 --> 53:50.061
Or I shall say we're
still not saving souls.

53:50.063 --> 53:52.563
You have no reason to be good.

53:54.233 --> 53:58.485
Split up into pairs of two,
your next challenge awaits.

54:17.673 --> 54:20.259
I will ask you three questions,

54:21.510 --> 54:24.177
if you don't tell
the truth you will

54:24.179 --> 54:29.184
experience pain worse than
you could ever imagine.

54:40.195 --> 54:41.989
All right, ask away.

54:44.284 --> 54:45.994
Are you a good man?

54:47.244 --> 54:49.746
Nope.

54:49.748 --> 54:53.460
Who was the man you
saw, the shape shifter?

54:54.626 --> 54:56.003
He was a Yankee soldier.

54:57.588 --> 54:58.920
I don't know who that
shape shifter was,

54:58.922 --> 55:01.967
coulda been any man or anything.

55:03.969 --> 55:07.429
How did you know
that Yankee soldier?

55:22.112 --> 55:23.612
I don't know.

55:23.614 --> 55:25.280
Roland, just tell the truth.

55:36.418 --> 55:38.836
Roland, tell me the truth.

55:38.838 --> 55:40.463
I don't know who he is.

55:40.465 --> 55:42.005
I don't know who he was.

55:45.344 --> 55:46.177
I'm not gonna tell 'em.

55:50.016 --> 55:52.516
Roland just talk.

55:52.518 --> 55:54.603
All right, I can do it.

55:57.440 --> 55:58.856
He was my brother Wesley.

56:04.030 --> 56:06.613
You, you killed
your own brother?

56:09.744 --> 56:11.454
We were fighting
for opposite sides.

56:14.916 --> 56:19.961
I was a rebel, he was
fighting for the North.

56:19.963 --> 56:21.586
He cried for mercy.

56:24.592 --> 56:25.590
I didn't listen.

56:33.684 --> 56:36.476
You better get
away from me Annie.

56:36.478 --> 56:38.646
It's nothing worse
than killing your kin.

56:38.648 --> 56:39.733
Don't be like me.

56:43.318 --> 56:44.610
I'd rather
be a killer than

56:44.612 --> 56:46.364
a whimpering victim
like your brother.

56:47.364 --> 56:49.449
You did the right thing.

57:07.217 --> 57:10.010
The challenge is your choice.

57:10.012 --> 57:12.597
One of you must face the devil

57:12.599 --> 57:15.849
and then bargain for your soul.

57:15.851 --> 57:18.436
The other must face their past,

57:18.438 --> 57:20.146
and if you led a good life,

57:20.148 --> 57:24.608
you will forever
regret your last days.

57:24.610 --> 57:28.530
Choose your paths, one
the devil, one the past.

57:32.327 --> 57:34.242
Now I know you don't
much like me Jericho

57:34.244 --> 57:37.662
but I think we should play
this one fair and square.

57:37.664 --> 57:41.626
My past is safe, I
never killed anybody.

57:41.628 --> 57:43.670
I'm not a murderer like you,

57:43.672 --> 57:46.421
whether you face the
devil or your past

57:46.423 --> 57:50.133
Hell will have no
mercy on your soul.

57:50.135 --> 57:55.141
I will face my past, I
have nothing to fear.

01:00:01.601 --> 01:00:02.644
No!

01:01:39.449 --> 01:01:42.950
Now you
will face the devil.

01:02:08.228 --> 01:02:10.686
You
meeting the devil?

01:03:11.081 --> 01:03:17.878
When the devil summons us,
we have to strike a deal.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:22.758
Do you think the devil's
just gonna let us waltz back

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.596
into earth, let us finish
our final days in peace?

01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:28.889
It's called a bargain Roland?

01:03:28.891 --> 01:03:31.309
He's gonna want
something from us.

01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:32.771
What do we have to offer?

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.813
You're a mercenary,
you're used to doing

01:03:36.815 --> 01:03:38.859
things people couldn't
bear to do themselves.

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:46.076
What about you?

01:03:48.911 --> 01:03:53.040
We can work together,
do the devil's dirty work.

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:55.376
I'd be good at it.

01:03:57.128 --> 01:03:58.963
We make a good team,
don't you think?

01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:17.896
When you walk in there, you do

01:04:17.898 --> 01:04:19.317
not stick your neck out for me.

01:04:21.068 --> 01:04:23.612
'Cause I'm sure as hell not
gonna stick my neck out for you.

01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:30.159
That's fine.

01:04:30.161 --> 01:04:31.496
I can handle myself.

01:04:46.969 --> 01:04:48.469
You have a yearning to go back

01:04:48.471 --> 01:04:50.429
and make things
right with your wife.

01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:58.813
I'm willing to let you go back.

01:05:03.152 --> 01:05:06.028
What do you want
from me in return?

01:05:10.326 --> 01:05:11.825
I'd like you to walk to the next

01:05:11.827 --> 01:05:14.288
compartment and bring
me Ms. Hargrave's scalp.

01:05:16.833 --> 01:05:17.876
That's what I'd like.

01:05:19.168 --> 01:05:21.170
And if you do, you can
go back to your wife.

01:05:22.338 --> 01:05:24.213
Perhaps you can make
things work out.

01:05:29.346 --> 01:05:32.304
If you don't bring me her scalp,

01:05:32.306 --> 01:05:35.349
you'll answer to
the hammers of hell.

01:05:44.235 --> 01:05:46.778
Father don't
let them do this to me.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.445
Don't let them kill me Father.

01:05:51.159 --> 01:05:53.075
Get away from me.

01:05:53.077 --> 01:05:55.036
I can't believe anything that

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:57.246
comes out of your mouth Jericho.

01:05:57.248 --> 01:05:58.873
You're a monster.

01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:00.083
I made a promise to myself.

01:06:08.134 --> 01:06:13.139
I'd sooner stick this
knife up your white ass.

01:06:17.851 --> 01:06:20.103
I ain't your slave.

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:05.898
Not like this.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.191
Not like this.

01:07:09.487 --> 01:07:12.197
Master Stefan, not like this.

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:25.378
Let her go.

01:07:26.628 --> 01:07:29.296
Your daughter
will be scalped before

01:07:29.298 --> 01:07:34.054
your eyes, again and again
and again for all eternity.

01:07:49.235 --> 01:07:54.572
I hear your amenable
to making deals.

01:07:54.574 --> 01:07:56.157
You heard correctly.

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.159
Let me and Roland
go back to earth.

01:07:58.161 --> 01:08:00.327
And after I'm done
living my life,

01:08:00.329 --> 01:08:02.996
I'll be your mercenary
for the rest of eternity.

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:11.255
If you go back to earth,
you'll do it on my terms.

01:08:11.257 --> 01:08:15.885
You'll be a good girl Ms.
Hargraves, a good girl.

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:29.398
I had a different
deal in mind.

01:08:53.006 --> 01:08:54.384
What's going on?

01:08:57.511 --> 01:08:58.678
Hold her down.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.513
Stop, let me go!

01:09:01.515 --> 01:09:03.057
Deal.

01:09:04.394 --> 01:09:06.227
You will live your
full life on earth,

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:08.395
he gets my soul,
that's the deal.

01:09:08.398 --> 01:09:11.857
I go to Hell, you
go back to Georgia,

01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:13.067
you live your life.

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:14.943
No stop Roland,
that's not what I want.

01:09:14.944 --> 01:09:18.196
I have to pay for my crimes,
you still have a choice.

01:09:23.453 --> 01:09:25.245
A deal is a deal.

01:10:05.997 --> 01:10:09.376
Go through that door
and choose life.

01:10:10.377 --> 01:10:11.753
It's on the other side.

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.548
Go back to a life
where you are weak.

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:22.639
If you stay here, you
can be my mercenary.

01:10:23.847 --> 01:10:27.018
You will hunt and
torture the damned.

01:10:28.353 --> 01:10:31.021
You will be powerful, feared.

01:11:14.481 --> 01:11:17.316
Let her go Master Stefan.

01:14:39.561 --> 01:14:41.103
Make me your mercenary.

01:16:24.917 --> 01:16:27.336
I understand what you did.

01:16:28.212 --> 01:16:31.839
You did it for me.

01:16:31.841 --> 01:16:33.468
You're a good man.

01:16:37.971 --> 01:16:40.138
I will always protect you.

01:17:26.563 --> 01:17:31.568
♪ Like I seen and
heard an awful sight ♪

01:17:33.737 --> 01:17:38.488
♪ The lightening flashed
and thunder rolled ♪

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:42.996
♪ Around the doomed
and bellowed souls ♪

01:17:46.123 --> 01:17:50.127
We ride at the hour,
prepare the train.

01:18:01.765 --> 01:18:05.018
All aboard, next stop Atlanta.

01:18:08.313 --> 01:18:10.312
All aboard.
