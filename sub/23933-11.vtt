WEBVTT

00:08.050 --> 00:10.389
Hey, I made it.

00:11.190 --> 00:12.620
You knew?

00:13.190 --> 00:14.420
Let's have a drink.

00:14.760 --> 00:15.790
What?

00:16.090 --> 00:18.290
You're at a get-together?\NFor what?

00:19.659 --> 00:21.229
The president\Nis a celebrity?

00:21.829 --> 00:23.330
No way.

00:24.370 --> 00:25.499
MC Jay?

00:26.170 --> 00:27.799
I heard he's\Nreally arrogant.

00:27.799 --> 00:30.109
Why would he drink with\Nnobodies like us?

00:35.740 --> 00:36.749
Si Hwan.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.249
Don't hang up.

00:38.950 --> 00:40.420
There's someone weird.

00:41.050 --> 00:42.350
I think he's a pervert.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.530
I guess I was wrong.

00:57.899 --> 00:59.600
Anyway, when are we\Ngoing to drink?

00:59.969 --> 01:02.639
Right. Okay, then.

01:06.109 --> 01:09.850
(Queen of Mystery 2)

01:38.169 --> 01:39.740
He's a man of ambition.

01:42.309 --> 01:43.550
So I'll wear this.

02:34.159 --> 02:36.429
Inspector Woo.\NWhat brings you here?

03:02.659 --> 03:03.730
What are you doing?

03:31.520 --> 03:32.589
This is...

03:33.320 --> 03:34.420
How did you know?

03:34.790 --> 03:36.629
I heard you met\NSecretary Kim.

03:39.089 --> 03:40.629
Why didn't you tell me?

03:41.999 --> 03:43.429
It's because Secretary Kim\Nis a dangerous figure.

03:43.429 --> 03:46.170
You say you're hiding\Nthings to protect me.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.399
I'm sorry,\Nbut I don't believe that.

03:52.140 --> 03:54.309
I can't trust anyone\Nright now.

03:54.710 --> 03:56.779
I don't even know\Nwho Secretary Kim is.

03:59.849 --> 04:00.879
Then...

04:01.279 --> 04:03.749
you've never seen\NSecretary Kim?

04:11.390 --> 04:13.629
Should I do\Nsome shopping today?

04:21.839 --> 04:24.070
That looks good on you.

04:25.770 --> 04:27.010
It's expensive though.

04:28.909 --> 04:31.909
I think\Nit's worth its price.

04:34.820 --> 04:36.049
How do you...

04:36.049 --> 04:38.320
keep in touch with\NSecretary Kim then?

04:38.620 --> 04:40.260
At first,\Nit was a high school girl.

04:40.260 --> 04:41.359
Chief.

04:49.260 --> 04:51.469
You're here. There you go.

04:53.440 --> 04:54.969
Then it was a homeless.

04:57.409 --> 04:58.669
It was a different person\Nevery time.

04:58.810 --> 05:00.140
Do you remember the voice?

05:00.609 --> 05:02.279
The voice changes\Nevery time too.

05:03.549 --> 05:04.649
Recently,

05:05.349 --> 05:06.680
it has been\Na woman's voice mostly.

05:08.919 --> 05:09.989
A woman?

05:26.099 --> 05:27.270
This is Secretary Kim.

05:27.599 --> 05:29.969
We need to change the time\Nand place of our meeting.

05:30.370 --> 05:31.409
This week.

05:31.909 --> 05:34.039
At Gyeonggi Province,\NHwasung,

05:34.039 --> 05:35.839
Dongpyeong-gun\NDansu-ro 74.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.279
Number seven.

05:37.909 --> 05:39.180
Take a taxi.

05:43.820 --> 05:44.890
Is that it?

05:51.330 --> 05:53.229
Don't forget\Nyour cellphone.

05:54.529 --> 05:55.760
Throw it out.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.700
It can be dangerous.

06:00.099 --> 06:02.339
Can you catch\NSecretary Kim this way?

06:03.109 --> 06:05.109
Secretary Kim\Nis wiretapping us.

06:05.409 --> 06:08.640
Perhaps it's not\NSecretary Kim.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.210
You said you'd help me\Nget away from Mr. Kim.

06:11.479 --> 06:12.880
So trust me.

06:13.479 --> 06:16.820
You and I are already\Non the same boat.

06:18.849 --> 06:20.460
Will Secretary Kim\Nreally come?

06:21.589 --> 06:24.190
What if it's a trap?

06:24.190 --> 06:25.430
I'll go.

06:28.229 --> 06:30.469
I barely escaped\NSinim Police Station.

06:30.729 --> 06:32.830
What did you do at\NSinim Police Station?

06:32.830 --> 06:34.839
What did Secretary Kim\Ndemand?

06:35.169 --> 06:36.270
All I did was...

06:37.370 --> 06:40.239
to turn a blind eye\Nto what Detective Oh...

06:40.239 --> 06:41.380
investigated.

06:41.739 --> 06:43.049
It has to stop now.

06:43.909 --> 06:45.080
I...

06:46.010 --> 06:48.380
really want to\Nretire quietly.

06:49.020 --> 06:51.120
My daughter\Nworks here too.

06:52.450 --> 06:54.390
Please make sure\Nthere's no trouble.

06:57.029 --> 06:58.489
I'll help you.

06:58.789 --> 07:00.430
You help me...

07:01.200 --> 07:02.430
catch Secretary Kim.

07:03.130 --> 07:05.229
Excuse me? Hello.

07:05.229 --> 07:06.399
Welcome.

07:07.039 --> 07:08.370
What kind of house\Nare you looking for?

07:08.370 --> 07:10.210
I'm just looking\Nfor a studio apartment.

07:10.210 --> 07:11.239
Just for yourself?

07:11.539 --> 07:13.279
With cheap deposit.

07:17.409 --> 07:20.520
Isn't there\Na cleaner place?

07:21.849 --> 07:23.450
With the money you have...

07:23.450 --> 07:25.349
you can only get\Na residence room.

07:29.060 --> 07:32.130
Gosh, this is too small.

07:34.899 --> 07:38.099
Vacancies are hard to\Ncome by in Joongjin-dong.

07:38.529 --> 07:39.640
Still...

07:40.599 --> 07:43.909
Well, there's a room\Nin a house for rent.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.310
The landlord might not\Nlower the deposit though.

07:47.609 --> 07:48.739
Where's that?

07:55.250 --> 07:56.520
This is nice.

07:57.620 --> 08:00.289
All you can get is a dorm\Nroom with your money.

08:00.289 --> 08:02.089
But you're lucky.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.029
The landlord is a man.\NWill you be okay?

08:07.029 --> 08:09.570
Of course.\NI'm fine with that.

08:10.430 --> 08:12.169
If you say so.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.599
I'll take this place.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.710
How much is the deposit?

08:16.710 --> 08:18.570
He doesn't need\Na lot of money,

08:18.570 --> 08:21.080
so he just wants\Ntwo months of rent.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.279
Goodness.

08:22.279 --> 08:24.250
All the walking around\Nwas worth it.

08:24.979 --> 08:28.020
You should sign the lease\Nwhen he comes home.

08:28.020 --> 08:29.690
Yes, I will.

08:30.690 --> 08:31.789
Is this the room?

08:31.789 --> 08:34.359
No. It's this one.

08:41.299 --> 08:44.129
It's quiet and nice.

08:49.239 --> 08:51.170
You're home.

08:51.670 --> 08:54.680
The tenant wants to\Nsign the lease today.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.680
Sure.

09:01.979 --> 09:03.150
Inspector Woo?

09:04.920 --> 09:05.950
Ms. Yoo.

09:11.030 --> 09:13.460
Are you really going to\Nmove in here?

09:14.030 --> 09:16.999
I can't live\Nin the sauna forever.

09:17.430 --> 09:19.499
You're doing worse\Nthan I thought.

09:20.099 --> 09:21.269
Still,

09:21.570 --> 09:23.410
we see each other at work\Nevery day.

09:23.410 --> 09:25.369
So it's better.

09:25.369 --> 09:27.910
We can understand\Neach other.

09:28.379 --> 09:30.749
No, it'll be very\Nuncomfortable.

09:30.749 --> 09:33.879
No, I can't be picky\Nright now.

09:34.219 --> 09:35.619
Will you really be okay?

09:35.749 --> 09:37.489
Please, do me a favor.

09:37.489 --> 09:40.119
With what I have, I can\Nonly get a dorm room.

09:40.519 --> 09:43.359
I really have\Nno other choice.

09:44.290 --> 09:45.389
But...

09:45.859 --> 09:47.400
how can we live\Nin the same house?

09:47.400 --> 09:48.729
I won't bother you at all.

09:48.729 --> 09:50.200
I won't have time\Nto do that.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.599
I can cook really well.

09:51.670 --> 09:53.570
You'll be surprised.

09:53.570 --> 09:55.570
I don't need you\Nto cook for me.

09:56.869 --> 09:58.310
Let me stay temporarily.

09:59.639 --> 10:00.680
Please?

10:00.739 --> 10:01.979
Ms. Yoo. Please get up.

10:02.379 --> 10:03.450
Please.

10:12.790 --> 10:14.460
What would Detective Ha...

10:14.859 --> 10:17.460
have done without me?

10:18.859 --> 10:21.700
Detective Ha? You have to\Nmove in today.

10:21.759 --> 10:22.759
Already?

10:23.700 --> 10:26.269
It's hard to find a place\Nin Joongjin-dong.

10:27.869 --> 10:30.869
I guess you can do more\Nthan just catch culprits.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.379
Move now if you don't\Nwant to sleep...

10:33.379 --> 10:34.879
at the station again.

10:34.879 --> 10:37.580
Get your stuff,\Nand call the moving van.

10:37.580 --> 10:39.849
Hurry up.\NThere's no time to waste.

10:39.849 --> 10:41.280
Okay.

10:42.619 --> 10:43.619
Good.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.629
I forgot to say that it's\NInspector Woo's place.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.469
If he knew it was\NInspector Woo's house,

10:56.469 --> 10:57.999
he might not move in.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.639
This is just temporary.

11:00.839 --> 11:02.769
He'll have to move in\Nonce his stuff gets here.

11:05.009 --> 11:06.440
This is good.

11:13.219 --> 11:15.320
How are we going to\Nshare the bathroom?

11:16.320 --> 11:18.089
Should I clean\Nthe whole house?

11:20.359 --> 11:22.820
My pajamas are really old.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.229
Should I buy a new one?

11:28.300 --> 11:30.869
No. This won't work.

11:31.430 --> 11:33.139
I should tell her\Nit won't work.

11:36.269 --> 11:38.070
What does she mean\Nby sauna?

11:38.940 --> 11:40.580
Is she really having\Na hard time?

11:45.050 --> 11:46.650
This is driving me crazy.

11:58.690 --> 12:00.599
- Hello.\N- Hello.

12:00.599 --> 12:03.099
Where should we\Nput the boxes?

12:03.229 --> 12:05.070
- In that room.\N- Okay.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.739
- Hello.\N- Ms. Yoo.

12:12.910 --> 12:16.139
- This is...\N- Why are you here?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.920
Sir, this isn't\Nthe right place.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.589
I don't feel good\Nabout this.

12:28.889 --> 12:31.489
I wonder if the move\Nwent smoothly.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.430
Inspector Woo is with him,

12:35.430 --> 12:36.700
so he must've helped\NDetective Ha.

12:56.450 --> 12:58.219
They're in the same unit,

12:59.190 --> 13:00.690
so they can do\Nsome meetings at night.

13:01.089 --> 13:02.460
Things might be great\Nfor them.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.499
Come in.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.540
- Sir.\N- Yes?

13:19.910 --> 13:20.910
Well...

13:23.180 --> 13:24.509
I'm sorry for interrupting\Nyou at this hour.

13:28.450 --> 13:29.519
Attorney Oh.

13:31.450 --> 13:33.259
If you resign,

13:33.259 --> 13:34.960
the details of\Nour current projects...

13:34.960 --> 13:37.389
I'll make sure to complete\Nhanding over the details.

13:54.810 --> 13:56.580
If you leave our company,

13:56.749 --> 13:59.109
we'll have to give up on\Ntaking over Jinmi Group.

14:00.619 --> 14:03.050
But that's\Nthe biggest deal.

14:03.820 --> 14:05.219
Someone's pulling out\Nour employees...

14:05.219 --> 14:06.589
on purpose for that.

14:07.019 --> 14:09.489
15 employees of\Nthat team quit already.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.530
Is restructuring\Nunavoidable?

14:13.060 --> 14:14.060
Yes.

14:14.359 --> 14:16.160
Let's start with the\Npublic utility foundation.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.330
No, not Dongban.

14:18.729 --> 14:20.239
Let's exclude Dongban...

14:20.239 --> 14:21.499
for the restructuring.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.170
Where should\Nwe start with?

14:30.150 --> 14:32.280
What brings you here\Nat this hour, Hee Yeon?

14:32.749 --> 14:34.550
I was surprised\Nwhen I got your call.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.420
I just stopped\Nby on my way.

14:37.619 --> 14:38.790
Aren't you feeling\Na bit hungry?

14:39.619 --> 14:40.690
Thank you.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.330
Is something...

14:45.330 --> 14:46.330
(Letter of Resignation)

14:47.729 --> 14:49.160
going on these days?

14:50.269 --> 14:52.030
It's nothing.\NYou don't have to worry.

14:56.369 --> 14:58.670
I may be able to help you.

15:01.940 --> 15:03.509
The attorneys from\NHa and Jung Law Firm...

15:03.509 --> 15:04.950
seem to be swayed a lot.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.280
It's maybe because of...

15:07.050 --> 15:08.619
my father's absence.

15:11.089 --> 15:12.119
I am...

15:12.690 --> 15:14.759
the executive director\Nof Dongban now.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.359
And I'm the member of\NHa and Jung Law Firm too.

15:17.430 --> 15:19.259
I should be aware of\Nhow things go.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.170
15 attorneys\Nwho were in charge of...

15:24.170 --> 15:25.769
merging and acquiring\NJinmi Group...

15:26.900 --> 15:29.300
suddenly submitted\Ntheir resignation letters.

15:30.710 --> 15:33.239
Can I take a look at\Nthe list of them?

15:40.280 --> 15:41.580
You're awake.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.150
I guess you had\Na sound sleep.

15:47.119 --> 15:48.820
I like the scent\Nof the coffee.

15:55.660 --> 15:57.099
This is so uncomfortable.

16:00.540 --> 16:01.769
This is extremely\Nuncomfortable.

16:05.839 --> 16:06.910
Are you going to use it?

16:08.180 --> 16:09.339
Use it first.

16:09.339 --> 16:11.650
The landlord should\Nuse it first.

16:12.950 --> 16:14.019
Hurry.

16:19.019 --> 16:21.089
Gosh, this is\Nuncomfortable.

16:39.109 --> 16:41.739
It's good to see you\Ncome to work together.

16:42.410 --> 16:44.450
How was your first night?

16:44.749 --> 16:45.749
So-so.

16:46.349 --> 16:47.580
There's only one bathroom.

16:49.650 --> 16:52.219
Is Ms. Yoo Seol Ok here?\NMs. Yoo Seol Ok?

16:52.219 --> 16:53.219
I'm here.

16:53.719 --> 16:54.719
Come here.

16:55.359 --> 16:58.160
Make 50 cups of coffee\Nfor the meeting.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.800
Should I make coffee too?

17:00.229 --> 17:01.400
Do you not like it?

17:01.660 --> 17:04.700
I heard my position holds\Na lot of important duties,

17:04.700 --> 17:06.739
getting to be the first\Nto know crime cases.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
Says who?

17:09.969 --> 17:11.569
You can be the first to\Nlearn about cases there.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.180
It's like controlling\Nthe entire units.

17:13.180 --> 17:14.710
From Unit 1 to Unit 5,

17:14.710 --> 17:16.979
you can learn about\Nall of their cases.

17:17.249 --> 17:18.249
Why that...

17:19.549 --> 17:20.979
Well, do you want me\Nto make coffee then?

17:21.150 --> 17:23.119
- Forget it.\N- No, no.

17:23.150 --> 17:24.890
I'm good at making coffee.

17:29.890 --> 17:31.529
As soon as I finished\Nliving with my in-laws,

17:31.529 --> 17:32.660
I have to serve again.

17:41.039 --> 17:42.340
Hello, Professor Hwang.

17:43.340 --> 17:45.140
I have a sore throat,

17:45.140 --> 17:47.180
so can you go\Nmake some tea for me?

17:48.079 --> 17:49.079
Pardon?

17:49.610 --> 17:51.249
I have a sore throat,

17:51.249 --> 17:52.380
so make some tea for me.

17:52.380 --> 17:54.519
What did you say?

17:54.519 --> 17:56.049
I have a sore throat...

17:56.049 --> 17:57.049
Well...

17:59.719 --> 18:02.460
Go make some tea for me.\NTea!

18:03.860 --> 18:04.860
Tea.

18:04.989 --> 18:05.989
Okay.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.630
Here you go.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.029
Thank you.

18:27.779 --> 18:28.779
Professor Hwang.

18:29.019 --> 18:31.350
Is there something\Nyou want to say?

18:32.789 --> 18:34.719
By any chance,\Ndo you know...

18:34.719 --> 18:36.690
where the most boring\Nmiddle school is at?

18:37.930 --> 18:38.930
I don't know.

18:39.190 --> 18:40.329
Loading Middle School.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.650
Remain seated.

18:58.350 --> 18:59.350
Sir.

19:00.749 --> 19:01.850
How have you been?

19:02.579 --> 19:05.319
Please know that I always\Nhave my eyes on you.

19:05.749 --> 19:06.759
Please sit.

19:06.759 --> 19:08.789
Okay, thank you,\NLieutenant Ha.

19:14.759 --> 19:15.759
Sir.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.630
Did Ha Wan Seung say\Nsomething to you?

19:20.469 --> 19:21.469
Well...

19:22.600 --> 19:24.910
He's threatening me\Ndirectly now.

19:25.739 --> 19:26.739
Why that...

19:27.539 --> 19:30.210
I'll do my best to\Nkeep him outside...

19:30.210 --> 19:32.279
so that you don't\Nsee him around.

19:33.019 --> 19:35.749
Don't let him participate\Neven in our meeting.

19:35.749 --> 19:37.519
I keep losing my hair\Nbecause of him.

19:37.749 --> 19:39.049
Okay, don't worry.

19:45.729 --> 19:46.900
Please begin.

20:02.079 --> 20:03.249
Let's begin.

20:03.279 --> 20:04.279
Sir.

20:04.910 --> 20:07.319
We have a new member\Nin our team,

20:07.319 --> 20:09.019
so I'd like to introduce\Nher to you today.

20:09.479 --> 20:10.950
Go ahead, Mr. Hwang.

20:11.989 --> 20:14.059
Greet the others,\NKyung Mi.

20:14.319 --> 20:15.319
Okay.

20:19.729 --> 20:20.829
Hello.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.930
I'm the intern,\NKim Kyung Mi.

20:49.930 --> 20:52.729
It's my first time, so\NI'll need to learn a lot.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.499
Thank you in advance\Nfor your help.

21:03.940 --> 21:04.940
Goodness.

21:06.739 --> 21:08.610
Goodness, her face.

21:29.130 --> 21:30.130
Mr. Hwang.

21:31.130 --> 21:32.130
Stop it.

21:32.469 --> 21:33.469
It's childish.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.350
What's all this?

21:51.019 --> 21:52.590
I borrowed it\Nat the cafeteria.

21:53.920 --> 21:54.920
Well...

21:55.690 --> 21:57.930
Leave it there and go.

21:57.930 --> 21:58.930
- Here.\N- Thank you.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.259
Goodness.

22:04.529 --> 22:06.170
This isn't what I wanted.

22:14.039 --> 22:16.380
Kyung Mi, what's wrong\Nwith your face?

22:16.579 --> 22:17.579
Why?

22:43.440 --> 22:45.039
Great job.

22:47.210 --> 22:48.279
What was that?

22:49.340 --> 22:52.180
Beep, beep.

22:55.779 --> 22:56.789
You.

22:57.989 --> 23:00.390
Do you have\Nany complaints?

23:01.590 --> 23:04.059
Or do you have\Nsome paints?

23:07.600 --> 23:08.660
Are you angry?

23:09.900 --> 23:10.930
No.

23:11.569 --> 23:13.140
If you are trying so hard\Nto not laugh,

23:13.140 --> 23:15.239
that means\Nyou're really angry.

23:15.900 --> 23:17.340
I'm not angry!

23:24.579 --> 23:25.610
I guess not.

23:28.219 --> 23:30.249
Think of it as\Na tradition of forensics.

23:32.150 --> 23:35.019
He always does that\Nwith new team members.

23:37.960 --> 23:38.989
Oh, sure.

23:41.029 --> 23:43.329
He's done that to me too.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.569
Hello.

23:44.969 --> 23:47.700
I am a new member of\NUnit One, Gye Sung Woo,

23:48.100 --> 23:49.670
graduated the 21st class\Nof the police academy.

23:51.769 --> 23:53.140
My service to you all.

24:03.789 --> 24:04.819
Oh, right.

24:04.890 --> 24:07.190
I have special cream\Nthat can erase that off.

24:07.190 --> 24:08.190
I'll give it to you.

24:10.259 --> 24:11.360
Thank you.

24:22.539 --> 24:24.370
I can't believe I'm\Nmaking coffee at this age.

24:25.110 --> 24:26.840
This is so embarrassing.

24:28.279 --> 24:31.509
No, I was the one\Nwho was embarrassed.

24:32.509 --> 24:34.549
That's my life now.

24:35.450 --> 24:38.620
We're both too old\Nto be doing this.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.029
Put this on.

24:43.430 --> 24:44.489
Okay.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.029
Life can get pretty dirty.

24:49.100 --> 24:52.499
Now that this happened,\Nlet's just go drink.

24:52.769 --> 24:53.799
Sounds great.

24:58.710 --> 25:00.340
You're so pretty,\NKim Kyung Mi.

25:03.180 --> 25:05.049
You're so pretty,\NYoo Seol Ok.

25:09.549 --> 25:12.420
But it's really good\Nto be here with you.

25:12.420 --> 25:13.460
Me too.

25:19.829 --> 25:21.100
What do you want to eat?

25:21.329 --> 25:24.069
I want some fiery\Nand spicy chicken feet.

25:24.370 --> 25:27.840
I want to chug down\Nhot fish cake soup.

25:27.940 --> 25:30.170
With extra ground pepper\Nand chili powder.

25:30.170 --> 25:31.309
And spicy peppers.

25:32.870 --> 25:35.979
There's a cart bar right\Nout front. Let's go there.

25:35.979 --> 25:38.850
Okay. Let's drink\Nuntil we die today.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.749
I'm down. I'll make\Nmixed drinks for you.

25:43.019 --> 25:45.620
- Cheers.\N- Cheers.

25:49.219 --> 25:52.160
This is great. We haven't\Ndone this in so long.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.130
Girl, stop making a fuss.

25:55.059 --> 25:57.900
But it's the best\Nto drink with you.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.170
Of course.

25:59.170 --> 26:01.870
I'm nothing\Nwhen I don't make a fuss.

26:03.870 --> 26:05.340
But you know what,\NKyung Mi?

26:05.969 --> 26:07.640
I really envy you.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.749
You're my friend,\Nbut you're really great.

26:12.110 --> 26:13.719
You're good at everything.

26:15.579 --> 26:17.719
That's what I thought too.

26:19.090 --> 26:22.590
But I guess\NI was just lucky.

26:22.590 --> 26:23.789
No way.

26:24.690 --> 26:26.729
You lived\Nreally diligently.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.999
Everyone lives diligently.

26:31.670 --> 26:35.039
I feel like a fool\Nwhen I'm at the station.

26:35.870 --> 26:38.610
And when Professor Hwang\Nshouts at me,

26:39.039 --> 26:42.009
I sit there wondering\Nwhy I'm there.

26:45.150 --> 26:48.450
Why does the world bully\Nme like my in-laws...

26:48.450 --> 26:50.789
even after\NI got a divorce?

26:52.249 --> 26:53.259
I'm here.

26:53.759 --> 26:55.219
I'm your family.

26:57.029 --> 26:58.759
Right, my family.

26:58.989 --> 27:01.329
I can't believe I'm\Ncomforting you for once.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.969
Goodness.

27:05.930 --> 27:07.100
Constable Shin.

27:09.140 --> 27:10.440
You two were here.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.840
- Have a seat.\N- Grab a seat.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.239
Can we have\None more glass?

27:15.239 --> 27:16.249
Sure.

27:17.249 --> 27:20.950
Right. What happened\Nwith the security footage?

27:27.960 --> 27:29.519
Looks good.

27:29.519 --> 27:30.630
I...

27:31.059 --> 27:35.759
really want to catch that\Nbutt-touching pervert.

27:37.329 --> 27:40.999
You need to lure him\Nto catch him.

27:40.999 --> 27:43.940
Where at? How can you\Nknow where he'll be?

27:43.940 --> 27:46.809
He always takes the bus\Non his carpool day, right?

27:46.809 --> 27:48.380
- Yes.\N- That means...

27:48.380 --> 27:50.509
he always takes the bus\Naround the same time.

27:50.509 --> 27:51.509
Yes.

27:52.850 --> 27:53.979
Were there...

27:55.549 --> 27:58.420
anyone else\Nwho got harassed...

27:59.019 --> 28:00.219
the same way?

28:03.489 --> 28:05.259
Come to think about it,

28:06.499 --> 28:09.029
I think there were\Nother victims.

28:20.180 --> 28:21.440
I could tell...

28:21.440 --> 28:23.610
that he just\Nharassed her sexually.

28:25.479 --> 28:27.749
I just let\Nthose moments pass...

28:28.150 --> 28:30.249
before I became\Na police officer.

28:32.019 --> 28:35.360
It's hard to scream out\Nwhen it happens to you.

28:35.590 --> 28:36.630
It's just too scary.

28:36.829 --> 28:37.890
She's right.

28:40.430 --> 28:43.999
That happened to me often\Nback in high school.

28:44.969 --> 28:46.100
And...

28:46.739 --> 28:50.410
the same guy usually does\Nthat in the same place.

28:50.410 --> 28:51.410
Yes.

28:51.610 --> 28:54.640
There are some things\NI'm suspicious of.

28:55.279 --> 28:56.979
When he got off,

28:57.680 --> 29:00.819
he pressed me against\Nthe card machine.

29:09.660 --> 29:12.160
There's a high chance\Nthat he'll show up again.

29:12.789 --> 29:15.059
It's not like I can wear\Ncameras on my hips.

29:20.900 --> 29:22.440
I have an idea!

29:37.190 --> 29:38.190
Na Ra.

29:38.890 --> 29:40.559
Today isn't\Nyour carpool day.

29:40.559 --> 29:42.420
Why do you want to\Ntake the bus?

29:43.130 --> 29:45.559
My car is too small.\NI like big cars.

29:50.299 --> 29:51.299
Na Ra.

29:51.769 --> 29:53.269
Have you seen the news?

29:53.739 --> 29:56.039
Don't go near\Nthe card machine. Okay?

30:56.100 --> 30:57.630
What are you doing?

31:09.380 --> 31:10.410
Wait.

31:15.049 --> 31:17.390
I'm a police officer.\NPlease stop the bus.

31:25.660 --> 31:27.559
There is a molester\Nin this bus.

31:27.799 --> 31:29.670
Please lock up\Nboth front and back doors.

31:30.630 --> 31:32.829
Please cooperate.

31:48.779 --> 31:49.950
Thank you.

31:51.289 --> 31:53.219
Please cooperate.

31:56.860 --> 31:57.960
Thank you.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.900
Thank you for\Nyour cooperation.

32:19.049 --> 32:20.880
Please cooperate.

33:05.430 --> 33:06.860
Put your hands\Non your back.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.529
Under Article 11 of\NSexual Assault Law,

33:09.799 --> 33:11.499
you're under arrest\Nfor sexual crime...

33:11.499 --> 33:12.499
at crowded places.

33:12.499 --> 33:14.499
You're good,\NConstable Shin.

33:14.569 --> 33:15.700
I guess\Nyou didn't need me.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.239
We caught the culprit.

33:17.769 --> 33:19.979
Good job. You did great.

33:20.140 --> 33:21.440
Good work.

33:22.779 --> 33:24.009
(Joongjin Police Station)

33:28.979 --> 33:31.489
The new conscripted\Npolicemen are coming.

33:31.719 --> 33:33.460
So prepare a foot bath\Nceremony.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.819
- A foot bath ceremony?\N- Yes.

33:35.860 --> 33:38.759
It's a part of betterment\Nof labor conditions.

33:38.860 --> 33:40.299
During the ceremony,

33:40.299 --> 33:43.299
the chief will wash\Ntheir feet himself.

33:43.469 --> 33:44.469
You know...

33:44.930 --> 33:46.130
how the chief...

33:46.269 --> 33:49.269
considers procedures\Nvery important.

33:49.269 --> 33:50.710
Don't forget the order\Nof things.

33:51.969 --> 33:55.039
Prepare a hot water basin\Nin front of the chair.

33:55.410 --> 33:57.880
Towel on the left.\NSoap on the right.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.420
Towel on the left.\NSoap on the right.

34:00.420 --> 34:04.249
Don't forget the chief's\Ncushion for his knees.

34:04.249 --> 34:05.450
Otherwise his knees\Nwill hurt.

34:05.450 --> 34:06.660
(Knee cushion)

34:06.660 --> 34:09.159
One of them...

34:09.319 --> 34:10.860
is MC Jay.

34:10.860 --> 34:13.559
Find him and put him\Nin the nicest chair.

34:13.559 --> 34:15.099
MC Jay?

34:15.099 --> 34:16.630
Yes, MC Jay.

34:16.630 --> 34:18.329
It's not "Dear J"\Nby Lee Sun Hee.

34:18.329 --> 34:21.469
How do I know who he is?

34:22.239 --> 34:23.710
Don't you know MC Jay?

34:23.710 --> 34:25.639
He's a famous singer.

34:25.639 --> 34:28.280
You know, he does this.

34:28.510 --> 34:31.809
Gosh, you should know\Nthese things.

34:44.389 --> 34:47.130
MC Jay. It's MC Jay!

34:47.498 --> 34:48.599
Stop.

34:49.998 --> 34:50.998
Where are you going?

34:51.300 --> 34:52.300
It's nothing.

34:52.300 --> 34:53.940
- What do you mean?\N- What? Nothing.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.469
- What?\N- What?

34:56.099 --> 34:57.740
Get inside.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.190
Get your stuff.

35:15.190 --> 35:16.389
- Yes, sir.\N- Yes, sir.

35:24.729 --> 35:25.729
Stand up straight.

35:28.470 --> 35:31.269
You'll meet\Nwith the chief.

35:31.269 --> 35:32.309
Follow me, got it?

35:32.309 --> 35:33.409
- Yes, sir.\N- Yes, sir.

35:33.409 --> 35:34.409
Newbie.

35:34.940 --> 35:35.940
Transfer.

35:36.749 --> 35:38.409
Follow me.

35:39.110 --> 35:40.179
Are you here to camp?

35:40.820 --> 35:41.849
I'm sorry, sir.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.829
He told me to bring them.

35:52.059 --> 35:53.800
They're here.

35:54.199 --> 35:55.199
Newbie.

35:55.559 --> 35:56.570
Transfer.

35:57.300 --> 35:59.099
It's these two.

36:02.099 --> 36:03.240
Let's go.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.340
Yoo Seol Ok? Gosh.

36:05.710 --> 36:06.710
Awesome.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.579
Yoo Seol Ok!

36:08.579 --> 36:10.409
- Yoo Seol Ok.\N- What are you doing?

36:10.849 --> 36:11.949
I'm sorry, sir.

36:15.849 --> 36:17.749
- Are they them?\N- Yes.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.889
Gosh. Who is MC Jay?

36:21.889 --> 36:23.030
I got his picture.

36:23.490 --> 36:24.490
Good.

36:27.229 --> 36:29.530
I can't see his face.

36:34.070 --> 36:35.269
Well...

36:43.449 --> 36:44.849
It can't be him.

36:48.619 --> 36:50.119
It's him.

36:50.119 --> 36:51.650
He looks like a celebrity.

36:52.320 --> 36:53.320
MC Jay?

36:53.320 --> 36:55.659
Obviously it's him.

36:55.889 --> 36:59.360
Can't you tell? Goodness.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.699
- I heard a lot about you.\N- Thank you, sir.

37:03.199 --> 37:04.329
Let's go.

37:04.499 --> 37:07.800
Please give me\Nyour autograph later.

37:07.800 --> 37:08.800
This way.

37:17.780 --> 37:19.979
- Hey.\N- Private Park Jae Soon.

37:20.619 --> 37:22.420
- Are you here on a tour?\N- No, sir.

37:24.119 --> 37:26.420
Welcome to\NJoongjin Police Station.

37:26.420 --> 37:27.420
Thank you, sir.

37:28.559 --> 37:29.559
Let's go.

37:30.690 --> 37:31.860
I'm fine, sir.

37:43.309 --> 37:45.369
Look at all that hair.

37:47.139 --> 37:48.210
You beast.

37:54.820 --> 37:56.650
Goodness.

37:57.849 --> 37:59.960
Is everything ready?

37:59.960 --> 38:01.619
Yes, sir.

38:03.260 --> 38:05.630
- Come here for a second.\N- Yes, sir.

38:07.260 --> 38:08.599
Is he that guy?

38:08.599 --> 38:10.130
Yes, sir.

38:10.599 --> 38:12.229
Is he that famous?

38:12.229 --> 38:15.440
Yes. He's the hottest\Nrapper there is.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.639
They say\Nhe's an amazing rapper.

38:17.639 --> 38:19.110
- Really?\N- Yes.

38:19.110 --> 38:20.309
Where's the camera?

38:20.309 --> 38:22.010
I'll bring it.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.150
We'll get a picture.

38:25.050 --> 38:29.119
Your right side\Nis more handsome.

38:29.119 --> 38:30.690
So I'll take it\Nfrom the right side.

38:30.690 --> 38:32.289
All right.\NI'll stand this way.

38:32.289 --> 38:33.289
Yes, sir.

38:33.389 --> 38:35.119
That's great.

38:39.999 --> 38:41.559
Go sit in the corner.

38:41.559 --> 38:42.760
Don't get in my way.

38:42.760 --> 38:43.769
- Yes, sir.\N- Yes, sir.

38:46.670 --> 38:48.940
Make yourselves\Ncomfortable.

38:48.940 --> 38:51.369
Relax. Make yourself\Nat home.

38:51.369 --> 38:52.510
- Yes, sir.\N- Relax.

38:53.309 --> 38:54.409
It's all right.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.210
Goodness.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.220
Relax. It's okay.

39:03.150 --> 39:05.019
How's the water\Ntemperature?

39:05.019 --> 39:07.289
- It's good, sir.\N- That's good.

39:09.729 --> 39:13.099
We're so honored to have\Nsuch a famous person...

39:13.400 --> 39:16.729
like you at\NJoongjin Police Station.

39:17.470 --> 39:18.999
My feet smell\Nterrible, sir.

39:18.999 --> 39:21.970
It's okay. The smell...

39:24.369 --> 39:25.570
- Sir.\N- Yes?

39:25.570 --> 39:27.409
- Benevolent smile.\N- Okay.

39:37.889 --> 39:38.889
Good.

39:40.690 --> 39:43.329
If you have any concerns\Nor complaints...

39:43.329 --> 39:44.490
while you're here,

39:44.630 --> 39:47.800
you can tell us anytime,\NMC Jay.

39:47.999 --> 39:49.199
All right.

39:49.199 --> 39:50.829
I'm not MC Jay, sir.

39:59.070 --> 40:01.039
You're not MC Jay?

40:01.440 --> 40:02.440
No, sir.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.280
Wait.

40:05.909 --> 40:07.619
Hey.

40:08.949 --> 40:10.019
He says he's not MC Jay.

40:10.019 --> 40:12.320
He is. Seol Ok said...

40:12.320 --> 40:13.820
He says he isn't.

40:13.820 --> 40:15.659
Then who is MC Jay?

40:16.119 --> 40:18.429
Private Park Jae Soon.

40:18.690 --> 40:20.260
I'm MC Jay, sir.

40:21.760 --> 40:22.760
Is it him?

40:24.900 --> 40:28.170
Are you really MCJ ay?

40:28.170 --> 40:29.570
Are you?

40:29.570 --> 40:31.909
Yes, sir. MC Jay.

40:37.210 --> 40:38.210
You...

40:38.749 --> 40:40.220
Manager Jo,\Nwe need to talk.

40:43.849 --> 40:45.349
Who are you then?

40:45.849 --> 40:48.820
I knew it when I saw\Nyour hairy legs.

40:59.199 --> 41:00.599
- What is that?\N- What?

41:01.869 --> 41:03.940
- What?\N- Special Investigation?

41:04.510 --> 41:08.039
Well, the chief\Nis responding instantly.

41:08.039 --> 41:10.079
Are you really\Non his side now?

41:10.079 --> 41:12.979
I am. I'm a very\Nsociable guy.

41:13.119 --> 41:14.320
I've been\Njust very busy...

41:14.320 --> 41:15.949
catching criminals lately.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.990
I didn't know\Nyou were sociable.

41:18.990 --> 41:22.659
I want you to read things\Ncarefully.

41:24.460 --> 41:26.159
(Special Investigation...)

41:26.159 --> 41:28.530
(Unit for Catching\NPerverts)

41:28.530 --> 41:30.300
- What?\N- Joongjin Police Station.

41:30.300 --> 41:32.070
- Catching...\N- Perverts?

41:32.070 --> 41:33.570
Did you put the sign up?

41:34.300 --> 41:36.099
Nicely done.

41:36.099 --> 41:39.340
Gosh, it's nice.\NIt blocks the sun.

41:40.139 --> 41:41.610
- There's one more.\N- Yes, sir.

41:41.740 --> 41:43.880
Put that one up too.

41:44.050 --> 41:45.050
Sir.

41:45.679 --> 41:46.880
What's all this?

41:46.880 --> 41:49.820
This is the most urgent\Nproblem.

41:49.820 --> 41:50.849
Please be in charge\Nof the special unit...

41:50.849 --> 41:52.019
to catch perverts.

41:53.090 --> 41:54.990
Does the chief know this?

41:55.220 --> 41:57.329
He'll be furious\Nif he finds out.

41:57.329 --> 41:59.760
I have authority\Nover this.

42:00.559 --> 42:02.199
The chief doesn't know\Npractical affairs.

42:02.229 --> 42:03.729
He has to follow\Nmy decision.

42:03.729 --> 42:06.340
You should've been\Non his side first.

42:06.340 --> 42:08.199
You don't know the order.

42:08.199 --> 42:09.639
Go do your work.

42:09.639 --> 42:12.740
There are about 80 to\N110 perverts in the area.

42:12.740 --> 42:14.979
If we catch one per week,

42:15.479 --> 42:17.050
it'll take at least\Ntwo years.

42:17.150 --> 42:18.749
Mopping up perverts\Nhas been...

42:19.280 --> 42:21.679
Joongjin Station's\Nlong-cherished goal.

42:21.979 --> 42:23.249
I'm expecting\Na lot from you.

42:25.050 --> 42:26.659
Sir. What's this?

42:26.889 --> 42:28.460
We have\Ntwo great talents...

42:28.460 --> 42:29.659
here with us.

42:29.659 --> 42:31.590
So we need to make\Nenough use of them.

42:32.090 --> 42:35.829
A total of 87 missing\Nreports came in last year,

42:36.269 --> 42:38.030
but only two cases\Nwere solved.

42:38.599 --> 42:39.840
That's like winning\Na lottery.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.240
(Unit for Catching\NPerverts)

42:42.240 --> 42:44.639
Solving missing cases...

42:44.639 --> 42:47.079
has been our\Nlong-cherished business.

42:48.809 --> 42:50.179
We're expecting\Na lot from you.

42:50.650 --> 42:52.349
Why's everything our\Nlong-cherished business?

42:53.720 --> 42:56.289
You should be able to\Nhandle this as our leader.

42:58.820 --> 43:01.090
You haven't forgotten\Nthat I'm your leader.

43:01.690 --> 43:03.389
That's glad.

43:06.760 --> 43:08.199
Do they want me\Nto do these...

43:08.199 --> 43:09.769
all by myself\Nwithout any teammates?

43:13.570 --> 43:14.970
This is frustrating.

43:17.610 --> 43:20.240
Pervert reports are most\Nfrequent around this area.

43:22.079 --> 43:24.110
Joongjin Girls'\NHigh School...

43:24.110 --> 43:25.849
is like a sacred place\Nto perverts.

43:26.320 --> 43:28.119
It's where nearby perverts\Nin a trench coat...

43:28.119 --> 43:30.619
visit one after another\Nfor certain.

43:30.619 --> 43:31.650
I see.

43:31.920 --> 43:34.360
Come on. The lying\Nprofiler is lying again.

43:35.289 --> 43:36.289
Detective Ha.

43:37.030 --> 43:40.760
You keep forgetting\Nthat I'm your superior.

43:41.329 --> 43:42.360
I'm sorry.

43:44.030 --> 43:46.539
The lying profiler\Nis lying again.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.920
This is awesome.

44:01.519 --> 44:03.150
She was somewhere\Naround here.

44:06.019 --> 44:08.860
Seol Ok. Seol Ok!

44:09.260 --> 44:10.260
Seol Ok.

44:11.590 --> 44:14.499
- MC Jay?\N- Seol Ok.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.499
I'm a huge fan of yours...

44:17.499 --> 44:19.400
since the No Du Gil case.

44:20.539 --> 44:22.670
- Do you know that case?\N- Of course.

44:22.670 --> 44:23.809
It's the duct tape\Nmurder case.

44:23.809 --> 44:25.039
The poisoning case,

44:25.039 --> 44:26.539
and the marriage fraud\Ncase.

44:26.610 --> 44:28.639
I even joined\Nyour fan club too.

44:29.039 --> 44:30.309
- My fan club?\N- Yes.

44:30.550 --> 44:33.079
"Yoo Seol Ok Fan Club".

44:36.220 --> 44:37.990
How many members\Nare there?

44:37.990 --> 44:38.990
Two including me.

44:39.050 --> 44:40.860
I don't know if the other\Nis a girl or a guy.

44:41.260 --> 44:43.729
Oh, the fan club\Nwith two members.

44:43.729 --> 44:44.760
Yes.

44:46.530 --> 44:47.760
Can I get your autograph?

44:48.329 --> 44:49.599
- My autograph?\N- Yes.

44:49.599 --> 44:50.829
My autograph?

44:53.170 --> 44:54.369
Goodness, it's awesome.

44:58.139 --> 45:00.639
To MC Jay.

45:01.440 --> 45:02.479
Awesome.

45:03.949 --> 45:05.510
It seems to be\Na bit sloppy.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.920
We should hold\Na fan meeting.

45:08.920 --> 45:10.720
- Let's do it on the 30th.\N- On the 30th?

45:10.720 --> 45:12.690
Is it an important day\Nfor you? Is it?

45:12.690 --> 45:14.789
Let me think. The 30th.

45:15.320 --> 45:17.590
The No Du Gil case\Nisn't right.

45:17.590 --> 45:19.999
The duct tape murder case\Nisn't right either.

45:20.599 --> 45:23.099
What is it? It must be\Nsomething important.

45:23.099 --> 45:24.199
It's my payday.

45:25.369 --> 45:26.440
I'll treat you that day.

45:26.440 --> 45:28.139
It's indeed the\Nmost important day.

45:28.139 --> 45:30.070
It's Seol Ok's payday.

45:30.639 --> 45:31.840
Why would you\Nwrite that down?

45:31.840 --> 45:32.909
Of course, I should.

45:32.909 --> 45:34.940
I should know everything\Nabout you as your fan.

45:35.679 --> 45:39.679
By the way, I have\Na favor to ask of you.

45:40.179 --> 45:41.420
What favor?

45:41.479 --> 45:42.949
Well, it's more like...

45:43.420 --> 45:44.590
a case request.

45:45.389 --> 45:47.760
My manager\Nis getting married,

45:48.220 --> 45:49.519
and his future wife had...

45:53.760 --> 45:56.499
- Seven years ago,\N- His father went missing.

45:57.499 --> 46:00.070
- I reported it...\N- To the police.

46:00.070 --> 46:01.800
But they said it was\Na runaway case.

46:02.940 --> 46:03.940
Even today...

46:04.170 --> 46:05.869
She reported him missing,

46:05.869 --> 46:07.510
but she was rejected since\Nit was seven years ago.

46:07.510 --> 46:09.780
Hey, stop cutting\Nher words and stay quiet.

46:10.210 --> 46:12.409
This is distracting. Move.

46:15.579 --> 46:16.690
So?

46:17.619 --> 46:19.019
Seol Ok, I'm MC Jay.

46:19.019 --> 46:20.690
So what? What do you want?

46:20.690 --> 46:22.760
You're the first civilian\Nto tell me to be quiet.

46:22.760 --> 46:23.760
Hey.

46:23.990 --> 46:26.360
I'm not just a civilian.

46:26.360 --> 46:27.760
I came out on TV.

46:28.130 --> 46:30.630
Right, when you caught\Nthe marriage con artists.

46:30.630 --> 46:32.630
I even recorded that.

46:32.630 --> 46:35.570
You're my fan,\Nso behave like one.

46:35.570 --> 46:36.639
Stay chill and quiet.

46:42.079 --> 46:43.110
So?

46:43.579 --> 46:46.679
My mom has been waiting\Nfor my dad all her life.

46:47.519 --> 46:49.889
The house is old,\Nbut she wouldn't move out.

46:51.220 --> 46:53.619
If I get married now,\Nshe'll be alone.

46:54.389 --> 46:56.159
You must be worried a lot.

46:56.429 --> 46:58.690
I'll try to look for him.

46:59.599 --> 47:04.999
(Friendly Joongjin Police)

47:06.699 --> 47:08.170
- Hey.\N- Where's Inspector Woo?

47:08.740 --> 47:09.970
Weren't you waiting\Nfor me?

47:10.340 --> 47:12.039
Why are you\Nlooking for me?

47:12.340 --> 47:14.940
I got a case for which I\Nneed a profiler's advice.

47:14.940 --> 47:15.940
What case?

47:17.880 --> 47:20.119
Has there been\Na serial murder case?

47:20.119 --> 47:21.420
It's a missing case.

47:21.920 --> 47:23.019
It happened\Nseven years ago.

47:23.550 --> 47:25.320
A missing case that\Nhappened seven years ago?

47:25.990 --> 47:27.460
Do you want to\Nsolve that now?

47:28.119 --> 47:29.729
She's unbelievable.

47:29.729 --> 47:31.559
We don't just sit around\Nand do nothing, you see.

47:31.559 --> 47:33.400
How old was the person\Nwhen he went missing?

47:34.699 --> 47:35.829
He was 42 years old.

47:35.829 --> 47:38.030
It's not possible\Nhe got kidnapped then.

47:38.030 --> 47:39.300
He ran away from home.

47:39.599 --> 47:40.740
What about\Nhis living records?

47:40.940 --> 47:43.809
There are no records about\Nusing calls, credit cards,

47:44.039 --> 47:45.409
bank accounts\Nor leaving the country.

47:45.670 --> 47:47.309
Then he's dead...

47:47.309 --> 47:48.909
whether it's a suicide\Nor a murder.

47:49.780 --> 47:51.909
You can't conclude it\Nthat easily.

47:51.909 --> 47:55.150
This is all I can say\Nas a profiler.

47:55.150 --> 47:56.550
But you're\Na detective now.

48:00.220 --> 48:02.760
Detective Ha, find the\Nmissing person for her.

48:05.260 --> 48:07.760
Why should I? I'm busy.

48:11.400 --> 48:14.400
"Unit in charge of\Nsolving..."

48:14.999 --> 48:16.039
"missing cases."

48:21.579 --> 48:22.710
What's up?

48:23.909 --> 48:26.820
What? The pervert\Nappeared again?

48:27.119 --> 48:28.179
Okay, I'll go now.

48:29.050 --> 48:31.349
I'm busy because of\Nthe pervert case.

48:32.990 --> 48:34.019
Call me later.

48:34.019 --> 48:35.860
Don't go around\Nalone and cause trouble.

48:36.119 --> 48:37.289
I'll call you.

48:42.530 --> 48:44.329
- Detective Ha.\N- What brings you here?

48:44.570 --> 48:46.440
I'm here because of\Nthe dash cam footage...

48:46.440 --> 48:48.269
of the car parked\Nat Seodong Police Station.

48:48.269 --> 48:49.970
Inspector Woo\Nasked me for it.

48:50.639 --> 48:51.809
The dash cam footage?

48:52.240 --> 48:55.240
Right, you asked\Nme about Seo Hyun Soo...

48:55.240 --> 48:57.780
who visited you\Naround that time.

48:59.380 --> 49:01.619
Inspector Woo asked me\Nabout the same thing.

49:01.619 --> 49:04.619
He seemed to investigate\Non some crime.

49:04.849 --> 49:05.889
What crime?

49:06.260 --> 49:08.690
I'm not sure about that.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.659
He just said...

49:10.659 --> 49:12.929
Seo Hyun Soo\Nisn't just one person.

49:14.760 --> 49:16.229
He said that?

49:16.470 --> 49:18.999
Yes, I think that's\Nwhat I heard.

49:19.499 --> 49:20.740
Did you bring\Nthat footage with you?

49:21.440 --> 49:23.440
Yes, here.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.139
- Can I take it?\N- Well...

49:25.139 --> 49:26.610
It's what Inspector Woo\Nasked me for.

49:26.610 --> 49:29.010
I'll hand it to him.\NHe's at the headquarters.

49:29.380 --> 49:31.780
Okay. Please do it for me.

49:31.780 --> 49:33.179
- Thank you.\N- No problem.

49:49.300 --> 49:50.369
Who is she?

49:51.900 --> 49:55.300
Why is she pretending\Nto be Seo Hyun Soo?

50:00.639 --> 50:02.039
(Seo Hyun Soo)

50:13.159 --> 50:16.289
I remembered what she\Ntold me about that man.

50:16.630 --> 50:17.659
That man?

50:17.929 --> 50:20.260
You mean, the man who made\Nher act like Seo Hyun Soo?

50:20.599 --> 50:23.869
Yes, one of the staff\Nsaw that man.

50:24.130 --> 50:25.769
What staff do you mean?

50:25.999 --> 50:28.699
It's the staff\Nof her play.

50:29.139 --> 50:32.309
- Her play?\N- It's still on show.

50:32.309 --> 50:34.409
You might be able to see\Nhim if you go there now.

50:36.039 --> 50:37.309
I'll go right now.

51:24.829 --> 51:26.530
(Pierrot Theater)

51:29.829 --> 51:31.729
(Staff of\NJoo Hyun A's play)

51:57.590 --> 52:00.960
I was sleeping\Nat the back at that time.

52:01.960 --> 52:04.769
Some middle-aged man\Nwas waiting for her.

52:06.869 --> 52:08.800
I stayed quiet\Nnot to get caught.

52:08.970 --> 52:10.840
I didn't want to get\Nnagged for slacking off.

52:13.909 --> 52:15.740
I heard Joo Hyun A\Nwas requested...

52:17.110 --> 52:19.880
to do something\Nstrange that day.

52:20.249 --> 52:22.889
Yes, after he left,

52:23.090 --> 52:25.090
she was happy that\Nshe got a part-time job.

52:25.590 --> 52:28.559
She said she simply\Nhad to give a name card...

52:28.559 --> 52:30.460
and say the name.

52:32.630 --> 52:35.559
Tell him that\Nit's Seo Hyun Soo.

52:38.869 --> 52:40.740
She's highly suspicious,

52:41.099 --> 52:42.369
so she said\Nshe'll record it.

52:42.470 --> 52:43.740
Really?

52:49.749 --> 52:50.780
Look.

52:51.479 --> 52:52.479
Is this the guy?

52:53.249 --> 52:54.280
That's his jacket.

52:55.650 --> 52:57.249
Do you remember his face?

53:00.619 --> 53:02.220
I don't.

53:03.159 --> 53:05.789
He looked quite old.

53:07.130 --> 53:09.699
But why did she suddenly\Nquit acting on stage?

53:09.769 --> 53:10.900
Ms. Joo Hyun A has...

53:24.979 --> 53:26.349
What brings you here?

53:27.079 --> 53:28.420
I love watching plays.

53:28.979 --> 53:30.550
It's not on yet.

53:31.949 --> 53:33.420
Who are you here to see?

53:33.920 --> 53:35.260
Why does that\Nmatter to you?

53:35.720 --> 53:37.329
Why do you care\Nso much about me?

53:37.829 --> 53:39.289
Are you looking for\NSeo Hyun Soo?

53:40.229 --> 53:41.300
Seo Hyun Soo?

53:41.499 --> 53:42.929
The same Seo Hyun Soo...

53:43.369 --> 53:44.499
who died 17 years ago.

53:45.130 --> 53:47.039
A profiler\Ngoes after suspects,

53:47.039 --> 53:48.800
not victims.

53:49.199 --> 53:50.909
And she's already dead.

53:51.340 --> 53:52.869
I know\Nyou're after something.

53:53.440 --> 53:54.539
Do you?

53:55.210 --> 53:56.849
What am I after?

53:57.979 --> 54:00.119
But I think\Nwe can be sure...

54:00.380 --> 54:01.720
that you're after me.

54:07.519 --> 54:08.519
What, lady?

54:09.760 --> 54:11.360
I'm really busy.

54:33.720 --> 54:35.749
I said I'm busy.\NStop calling me.

54:36.490 --> 54:37.820
You told me to call.

54:42.559 --> 54:44.659
Is this it? The missing\Ncase from seven years ago?

54:44.659 --> 54:45.659
Yes.

54:50.570 --> 54:51.729
Excuse us.

54:53.900 --> 54:54.900
You're here.

54:55.199 --> 54:56.240
Come in.

55:02.679 --> 55:04.110
It's an old house.

55:04.650 --> 55:06.650
My parents bought it...

55:06.650 --> 55:08.050
when they got married.

55:08.349 --> 55:09.650
My dad used to...

55:09.650 --> 55:11.490
fix the place\Nwhen he was around.

55:13.360 --> 55:16.019
Mom, the detectives\Nare here.

55:16.019 --> 55:17.030
Excuse me.

55:17.889 --> 55:20.099
I'm a detective.\NShe's not.

55:27.170 --> 55:28.300
Thank you.

55:36.479 --> 55:37.510
He will...

55:39.079 --> 55:40.519
come home soon.

55:41.579 --> 55:44.349
Mom, it's been\Nseven years already.

55:47.460 --> 55:49.260
He will come back.

55:51.789 --> 55:54.400
He cared about nothing\Nbut his home and family.

55:54.699 --> 55:55.829
Was anything\Nout of the ordinary...

55:56.159 --> 55:57.470
on the day that\Nhe went missing?

55:58.099 --> 56:00.070
He wasn't home\Nthe next morning,

56:00.440 --> 56:02.070
so I figured\Nhe went to work.

56:02.099 --> 56:03.769
Does anyone hold\Na grudge against him?

56:03.769 --> 56:04.940
Any accidents he caused?

56:07.880 --> 56:09.679
He never drank,

56:10.150 --> 56:11.650
and he couldn't\Ndrive either.

56:12.880 --> 56:14.679
And he isn't a type\Nto get in fights.

56:22.289 --> 56:25.090
All of his stuff\Nis in this place.

56:27.829 --> 56:28.999
Did you throw\Nanything away?

56:29.829 --> 56:30.829
No.

56:31.170 --> 56:33.539
My mom thinks\Nhe'll come back...

56:33.539 --> 56:36.139
and use these again.

56:37.539 --> 56:40.240
She still sleeps\Nwith a pillow next to her,

56:41.309 --> 56:43.179
like my dad\Nis home already.

56:44.210 --> 56:45.710
Do you remember\Nanything clearly...

56:46.110 --> 56:47.650
from the day\Nwhen he went missing?

56:48.650 --> 56:50.920
I was in a dorm back then,

56:50.920 --> 56:52.119
so I don't really know.

56:52.590 --> 56:54.720
I knew he went missing\Nwhen my mom called me.

56:55.420 --> 56:57.990
She said he hasn't\Ncome home from work.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.010
You saw Mr. Jang...

57:17.010 --> 57:19.349
walk out of his house on\Nthe day he went missing?

57:19.820 --> 57:23.320
He brought out a huge bag\Nin a very early morning.

57:23.320 --> 57:25.619
I figured he was going on\Na trip or something.

57:25.889 --> 57:27.720
Was anything else\Nout of the ordinary?

57:27.720 --> 57:29.260
It was still dark.

57:29.260 --> 57:32.289
I couldn't tell even\Nif anything was odd.

57:32.289 --> 57:33.300
Then...

57:33.599 --> 57:35.999
how did you know it was\NMr. Jang Myung Hoon?

57:35.999 --> 57:37.769
He walked out\Nof that house.

57:37.769 --> 57:39.639
So I figured it was him.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.340
So you've worked with him\Nfor a long time?

57:45.340 --> 57:48.010
Yes. For about 15 years.

57:50.179 --> 57:52.510
It must've been\Nreally tough...

57:52.510 --> 57:53.979
when Mr. Jang\Nsuddenly went missing.

57:54.920 --> 57:57.449
Or maybe it worked out\Npretty well for you.

57:58.519 --> 57:59.619
I mean, you got to...

57:59.619 --> 58:01.320
run the place alone now.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.429
What? What do you mean?

58:04.690 --> 58:06.699
(The 83rd Presidential\NBoxing Tournament)

58:06.699 --> 58:08.999
Do you box?

58:08.999 --> 58:11.630
Yes, I used to be\Na pretty good boxer.

58:13.539 --> 58:16.269
When was the last time\Nyou've seen Mr. Jang?

58:16.769 --> 58:18.269
The night he went missing.

58:18.639 --> 58:20.010
Around 9pm, I think.

58:20.210 --> 58:21.880
I saw him\Nwalk into his home.

58:22.579 --> 58:24.349
Before he went missing,

58:24.349 --> 58:26.449
he used to borrow books\Nevery Saturday.

58:26.720 --> 58:28.920
He lived with a schedule,\Nso I remember that.

58:28.920 --> 58:30.449
How did you know\Nhe went missing?

58:30.650 --> 58:32.119
I found out\Nwhen I called his phone...

58:32.119 --> 58:33.820
because he didn't\Nreturn a few books.

58:34.220 --> 58:36.190
His wife was\Ncrying so much...

58:36.190 --> 58:38.229
that I couldn't ask her\Nto return the books.

58:38.389 --> 58:41.329
What kind of books\Ndid he usually borrow?

58:41.559 --> 58:43.269
Romance novels.

58:45.729 --> 58:46.999
We have nothing.

58:47.670 --> 58:49.369
If we can't find someone\Nwho was gone yesterday,

58:49.369 --> 58:51.409
how can we find someone\Nfrom seven years ago?

58:52.110 --> 58:53.240
Everyone is strange.

58:54.409 --> 58:55.409
What is?

58:55.409 --> 58:57.010
Everyone remembers\Nwhat happened...

58:57.010 --> 58:59.150
seven years ago like\Nit was yesterday.

59:00.179 --> 59:02.380
This isn't just\Na simple missing case.

59:02.579 --> 59:05.320
Then what?\NAn abduction and murder?

59:06.190 --> 59:07.360
Let's go back\Nto the station.

59:07.490 --> 59:08.690
She reported him\Nas missing.

59:08.690 --> 59:09.860
I'm sure we have\Nsome data left.

59:10.260 --> 59:11.260
You're right.

59:15.059 --> 59:16.329
You were right.

59:17.199 --> 59:19.170
It doesn't seem like\Na simple missing case.

59:19.369 --> 59:21.070
"Was under investigation\Nas a murder case,"

59:21.070 --> 59:22.170
"but closed internally."

59:22.699 --> 59:24.610
There were three suspects.

59:24.740 --> 59:26.940
- Is this the report?\N- This is it.

59:27.210 --> 59:28.210
What?

59:29.010 --> 59:31.079
The detective\Nin charge was...

59:31.079 --> 59:32.809
(Lieutenant Gye Sung Woo)

59:32.809 --> 59:34.249
Lieutenant Gye Sung Woo?

59:34.249 --> 59:37.990
Then the one who knows\Nthe most about this is...

59:38.449 --> 59:39.490
Mr. Gye.

59:42.260 --> 59:43.260
Over there.

59:57.210 --> 01:00:01.010
(Seol Ok)

01:00:04.409 --> 01:00:05.409
Over here.

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:09.889
Are you the president\Nof "Yoo Seol Ok Fan Club"?

01:00:09.889 --> 01:00:11.449
Yes, that's me.

01:00:12.449 --> 01:00:15.019
I think\NI'm older than you.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.490
Then you can\Nspeak casually too.

01:00:16.929 --> 01:00:17.929
Okay, then.

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:20.599
You said you'll be here\Nwith a girl you like.

01:00:20.599 --> 01:00:21.630
Where is she?

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:23.999
She won't pick up.\NShe said she will be here.

01:00:24.599 --> 01:00:26.539
She was excited\Nto meet MC Jay.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.869
Wasn't she studying for\Npolice employment exam?

01:00:28.869 --> 01:00:30.039
She made it, didn't she?

01:00:30.039 --> 01:00:31.139
How did you know?

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.610
And you couldn't\Nreach her since then.

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.010
Of course,\Nthat's the case.

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:37.550
No way.

01:00:38.249 --> 01:00:39.309
That will not work.

01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:47.090
Hello? Seol Ok.

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.690
Where are you?

01:00:49.159 --> 01:00:50.829
Today is your fan meeting.

01:00:51.389 --> 01:00:52.659
Should I go\Nand pick you up?

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:55.659
A case?

01:00:55.999 --> 01:00:58.229
What case?\NToday is your fan meeting.

01:00:59.199 --> 01:01:01.970
At least come by\Nand say hi to us.

01:01:04.769 --> 01:01:07.240
My gosh,\Nyou were on your way.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.050
- You're here too.\N- Yes, I started this.

01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:12.249
Isn't this supposed to be\Na fan club?

01:01:12.249 --> 01:01:13.380
There's only you two.
