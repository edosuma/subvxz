WEBVTT

00:05.173 --> 00:08.276
Today marks the beginning
of the trial of Hugo Garza,

00:08.309 --> 00:10.344
known international arms dealer.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.813
The State is confident in
a conviction and looks forward

00:12.846 --> 00:14.548
to this violent man
being imprisoned

00:14.582 --> 00:16.684
for the rest of his life.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.286
IZZO:
Big day for you, Dwayne.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.587
Big day for both of us.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.289
Yeah, long time coming.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.557
Nine-month sting operation,
16 months pre-trial.

00:23.591 --> 00:27.361
Yeah, I'll be happy putting
Garza in the rearview mirror.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.163
IZZO:
Yeah, as long
as today goes well.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.464
Beautiful morning,
Agent Pride.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.366
Best one so far, Mr. Garza.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.369
If there is a hell,
I don't think even the devil's

00:35.403 --> 00:37.205
looking forward to
having that man around.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.574
Speaking of
rearview mirrors--

00:40.608 --> 00:42.176
updated briefs on
the cases stemming

00:42.210 --> 00:43.844
from your undercover
work earlier this year.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.846
I was hoping we could
sit down at some point,

00:45.879 --> 00:48.249
you can walk me through what you
know about the militia's ties

00:48.282 --> 00:50.784
to Zed Hastings.
The Father's minions

00:50.818 --> 00:52.586
are itching to get
back at the Fed

00:52.620 --> 00:53.854
who infiltrated
their ranks.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.090
I'll keep watching my back.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.458
Yeah, from your pinky toe

00:57.491 --> 00:59.360
all the way to the top
of your head.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.661
King, we got a problem.

01:00.694 --> 01:01.762
Name it.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.297
Federal marshals just called.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.266
They've lost track
of Don Lambert.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.577
I've been expecting this call.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.712
You climbed out a window, Don?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.748
Shook your security detail?

01:20.781 --> 01:24.285
I haven't had a moment
to myself in two years.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.854
I needed a drink.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.656
A liquid courage for the day.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.291
Where are you?
I'll come pick you up.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.126
No, that's all right. I got it.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.827
Look, Don,

01:33.861 --> 01:36.197
you're expected in court
in less than ten minutes,

01:36.230 --> 01:38.599
and I don't like the idea of you
being out there on your own.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.134
'Cause it's not safe?

01:40.168 --> 01:41.869
Not for you.
Yeah, well,

01:41.902 --> 01:44.205
keeping safe has taken its toll.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.539
Witness

01:45.573 --> 01:47.675
relocation can be tough.
I understand that.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.243
Hey, Dwayne...

01:49.277 --> 01:51.712
...you like poetry?

01:51.745 --> 01:53.281
I don't want to talk poetry.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.149
I want to talk getting you here.

01:55.183 --> 01:58.486
"I want to be reborn,
a babe in the sunlight,

01:58.519 --> 02:00.788
"entering a world
where pain is washed away

02:00.821 --> 02:03.157
by the spring rain."
Where are you?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.795
I'm on the verge, Dwayne.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.664
I'm ready
to put this all behind me.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.677
Don?

02:23.711 --> 02:26.414
Don!

02:26.447 --> 02:28.816
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:28.849 --> 02:31.552
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:31.585 --> 02:33.854
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:33.887 --> 02:35.289
* How, how, how, how

02:35.323 --> 02:37.425
* Hey, hey

02:43.497 --> 02:44.865
* You gotta come on.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.972
Victim is Don Lambert, former
accountant for Hugo Garza.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.276
Garza stole Navy weapons
and explosives.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.578
Was attempting to sell
'em to the highest bidder

02:57.611 --> 02:59.747
and Don was caught
laundering his money.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.315
And the AUSA

03:01.349 --> 03:03.817
got him to flip
on Garza.
Yeah, well,

03:03.851 --> 03:05.686
he flipped, all right.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.455
Anything?
BRODY:
Hard to make sense

03:07.488 --> 03:09.590
of what's car, what's human,
and what could be evidence.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.393
Hoping something in here helps
me identify the explosive.

03:12.426 --> 03:15.496
Must have taken quite a charge
to make that kind of mess.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.964
It's got to be plastics.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.700
Weapons grade, packed
by someone with the know-how.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.802
Any witnesses?
Lasalle's been canvassing.

03:21.835 --> 03:25.606
What do you got?
So far, everyone I've talked to
heard the big bad boom

03:25.639 --> 03:27.275
and then ran the other way.

03:27.308 --> 03:30.278
Great.
But see that bar over there?

03:30.311 --> 03:32.280
It's got a security camera
pointing toward the street.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.881
I had them download
the footage.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.917
At 8:04:13, all is calm.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.486
Then, at 8:04:15...

03:38.519 --> 03:40.888
PRIDE:
Explosion.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.323
Panic.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.557
You see this blue Mustang?

03:43.591 --> 03:44.892
Someone's inside.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.761
Yep. And it just
sits there and waits.

03:47.795 --> 03:52.866
And then, at 08:04:25,
it drives off calmly.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.903
Yeah, and that's how they caught
the Boston Marathon bombers.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.839
Everyone else ran off,
and they just stood there.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.409
Got a plate?
Partial.
First three letters--

04:01.442 --> 04:02.910
FLJ.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.845
All right, put out a BOLO,
find the owner.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.779
You got it.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.448
Get that evidence to Sebastian.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.982
See if he's got a take
on what kind of bomb was used.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.385
Call WITSEC.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.487
Find anyone
who had access to Lambert.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.889
He had a new
identity, new life,

04:15.923 --> 04:17.525
a hundred miles
from here.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.892
Someone gave his ass up.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.429
Yeah, find out who.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.335
Aah!

04:27.368 --> 04:29.703
What a mess.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.407
Anything left of him?

04:33.441 --> 04:36.310
Uh... not much.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.548
Don was a decent man.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.916
His accounts?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.918
Florist,

04:44.952 --> 04:49.523
bakery, beauty supplies.

04:49.557 --> 04:50.958
And the minute he found out

04:50.991 --> 04:53.561
what he was in the middle
of, he wanted to talk.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.697
Well, it's not
your fault, Dwayne.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.432
You can't protect a man

04:58.466 --> 05:01.068
who won't allow himself
to be protected.

05:01.101 --> 05:04.772
It's gonna be some time
before I finish up here, but...

05:04.805 --> 05:06.340
You're gonna need a DNA sample.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.742
For confirmation.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.781
He's got a wife.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.350
I'll talk to her.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.723
So, I... I brought
his toothbrush.

05:22.756 --> 05:28.862
Um, I also brought this shirt
which his sister gave him.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.498
She's kind of a bitch,

05:30.531 --> 05:32.500
but he looked really good
in this shirt.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.942
So you spoke with him?

05:41.975 --> 05:44.144
You know, just before?

05:44.177 --> 05:46.447
Quoted me poetry.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.951
"I want to be reborn..."

05:50.984 --> 05:52.753
"A babe in spring sunlight."

05:54.955 --> 05:57.157
Don was constantly writing me

05:57.190 --> 05:59.760
these little verses
on sticky notes.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.663
He would leave
them on my pillow.

06:02.696 --> 06:07.401
On the windshield
of my car.

06:07.435 --> 06:10.003
Oh, I found one
on the kitty litter bag once.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.006
Never wanted me to forget
how beautiful the world is.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.917
So, what now?

06:23.951 --> 06:25.686
Garza walks?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.622
I won't let that happen.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.758
We'll get him
for everything.

06:30.791 --> 06:35.195
Weapons trafficking,
stealing Navy assets.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.731
Don's murder.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.067
'Cause I swear...

06:40.100 --> 06:42.536
if Don goes in the ground,

06:42.570 --> 06:45.105
and Garza goes free...

06:45.138 --> 06:47.908
that's on you.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.445
Because you looked
us both in the eye.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.113
You made us a promise.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.484
LASALLE:
Hey, King?

07:02.255 --> 07:04.992
Agent Lasalle.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.031
Everything all right?

07:13.601 --> 07:16.103
What do you got, Chris?

07:16.136 --> 07:19.540
BOLO on the suspect's car
just came back.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.109
Was found rolled
on the levee.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.977
Call Brody and Sonja.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.713
They're already on their way.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.115
BRODY:
Suspect sideswiped
the tractor trailer

07:28.148 --> 07:29.950
as it was changing lanes.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.252
Lost control, rolled
the car onto the levee.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.688
The other driver
says he pulled over

07:34.722 --> 07:36.557
to approach the
car to offer help,

07:36.590 --> 07:38.992
but as he came up, the
driver took off running.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.595
The other driver's
giving a description,

07:41.629 --> 07:43.864
but he already said he
didn't get a good look.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.265
We got JPSO sweeping out.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.002
I bet our suspect's
wearing gloves.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.604
Probably won't be prints.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.845
Hang on.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.647
I got something.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.782
Wedged under the seat.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.588
It's a photo.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.693
Lambert.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.095
And Marc Maslow.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.666
Don Lambert's former
accounting partner.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.702
Serving time for racketeering
in federal prison

08:21.735 --> 08:25.305
and the only other person
who can put Garza away for life.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.875
You think Garza means
to kill Maslow next?

08:27.908 --> 08:29.810
Well, if he tries...

08:29.843 --> 08:32.179
gonna have to go through me.

08:43.323 --> 08:47.127
Keep Maslow in solitary
for his own protection.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.762
Yeah.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.564
I want eyes on him 24 hours,

08:50.598 --> 08:53.767
inside his cell and for the hour
he's in the yard.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.003
Thank you. What you find?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.138
Got a set of tracks here

08:58.171 --> 09:00.107
heading west
on top of the levee.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.280
Looks like
our driver was dragging his leg.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.618
I'll make a cast.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.786
Thank you.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.155
Anything?

09:15.188 --> 09:17.958
Inside is pristine.

09:17.991 --> 09:21.261
Outside not so much. Look, I'm
not sure if this is important,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.363
but it's definitely interesting.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.633
A ton of bees.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.835
Bees as in...
As in bzzz...

09:27.868 --> 09:30.838
So, I'm gonna do a pull
and get 'em to Sebastian.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.339
Well, he'll "bee" thrilled.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.776
You got a problem
with puns, honey?

09:37.678 --> 09:39.179
Bees to Sebastian.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.181
Find out who
the car's registered to.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.382
And ease up on the punny.

09:42.415 --> 09:47.187
Yeah, you're right. It's not
like this is a sting operation.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.322
Where you going?

09:49.356 --> 09:51.324
Got to end this
before it festers.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.896
(music playing, people
laughing, chatting nearby)

09:59.232 --> 10:02.002
Special Agent Pride.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.937
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

10:03.971 --> 10:06.707
Please, sit.
Have an Arnold Palmer.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.120
The lemonade was fresh-squeezed.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.960
PRIDE:
All blown up.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.963
So, I've heard.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.432
You plead out,

10:32.465 --> 10:34.935
give me who murdered
Mr. Lambert,

10:34.968 --> 10:38.105
cop to everything
you've ever done

10:38.138 --> 10:41.041
and I'll make sure
you're spared the needle.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.945
If I was going to plead out,

10:44.978 --> 10:48.048
I would've done it when Don
was still walking the earth.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.183
And if you
could actually tie me

10:50.217 --> 10:52.052
to Donny ka-boom...

10:52.085 --> 10:53.921
you wouldn't be here,

10:53.954 --> 10:56.023
pouring my refreshments
into my pool.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.260
You got nada, Agent Pride.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.295
Don't I?

11:05.966 --> 11:07.334
Maslow.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.137
He won't testify.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.740
Why, 'cause you're gonna
kill him, too?

11:12.773 --> 11:14.474
Because he hates you.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.343
He hates you more.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.779
He fears me.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.814
Which he should.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.919
And you...

11:25.953 --> 11:27.955
should fear me.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.895
Call your lawyers, Garza.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.930
Tell 'em you decided
to do the right thing.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.437
IZZO:
Maslow is safe.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.173
Moved to solitary
like you requested.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.375
U.S. penitentiary
in Abilene, right?

11:48.408 --> 11:50.778
Yeah, where I just sent
one of my deputies

11:50.811 --> 11:52.946
to talk to him about
testifying against Garza.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.782
Will you file that
for me, please?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.817
What'd Maslow say?
About testifying?

11:56.850 --> 11:59.352
Dwayne, Maslow's
not as reliable as Don.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.154
But he's all we got.
Okay, so

12:01.188 --> 12:03.056
he's agreed to testify

12:03.090 --> 12:04.958
for a reduced sentence
of time served.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.761
And that's the news that's good.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.799
What's the news that's not?

12:11.832 --> 12:13.200
That's where you come in.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.970
Come in.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.440
So you wanted to see me?

12:20.473 --> 12:22.843
Yeah.
We're headed to Texas.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.012
When?
Now.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.080
Got to escort
the new witness

12:27.114 --> 12:28.248
in the Garza case.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.450
Okay.
Fly there, fly back?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.119
Fly there, drive back.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.187
Maslow doesn't do planes.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.023
He doesn't do escalators.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.325
Doesn't like odd
numbers. He's...

12:38.358 --> 12:39.492
eccentric.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.261
And why do you have to do it?

12:41.294 --> 12:43.096
He requested me.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.531
Okay, then, why me?

12:44.564 --> 12:45.999
Lasalle knows the case.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.500
Brody's been here longer.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.536
But neither one of them
are any good at bee puns.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.872
Yeah. My head
is buzzing with them.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.876
Been a crazy
first few months.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.945
Wanted to hear
how things are going for you.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.280
So, this is supposed
to be, like...

13:00.313 --> 13:02.282
quality time?

13:02.315 --> 13:03.516
Bring those kale chips.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.218
Might even get
me to try one.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.855
Come on.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.356
DMV records came back
on our bomber's car.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.391
Registered
to a Frank Jameson.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.526
Only thing is
Frank Jameson...

13:13.560 --> 13:15.295
died two years ago.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.530
So our bomber is living
under a stolen identity?

13:17.564 --> 13:19.132
It looks like it.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.834
What's the latest
on the levee search?

13:20.868 --> 13:23.403
JPSO's frustrated
and dogs more so.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.437
Well, then I guess
it's a good thing

13:24.471 --> 13:26.406
Chris and Merri are on the case.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.308
Not you Chris and Merri,
the other Chris and Merri.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.011
Do we even ask?
I named the bees.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.847
So, most of the specimens
came back DOA,

13:33.881 --> 13:36.016
but two of them
were just stunned.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.284
So I nursed 'em
back to health

13:37.317 --> 13:39.586
and when they're
no longer evidence,

13:39.619 --> 13:42.022
I'm considering becoming
an urban apiarist.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.023
Chris and Merri,

13:43.056 --> 13:44.124
meet Chris and Merri.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.325
Oh. Which is which?

13:45.358 --> 13:46.326
Well, Chris is the one

13:46.359 --> 13:47.427
with the funny accent.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.561
Y'all are the ones with accents.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.197
So these little guys

13:50.230 --> 13:51.398
are Apis mellifera.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.900
They're your common honeybee,

13:52.933 --> 13:54.134
but inside
their stomachs

13:54.167 --> 13:56.336
is a very specific
kind of honey.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.537
Specific how?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.306
Well, this
particular varietal

13:59.339 --> 14:02.575
is usually only found in
the Tigray region of Ethiopia.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.544
Ancient monasteries
there keep the bees

14:04.577 --> 14:06.146
to produce a rare white honey.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.115
So Chris and Merri
came from Africa.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.450
Well, not necessarily. It turns
out, the same order of monks

14:10.483 --> 14:12.452
operates an abbey
just north of here.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.054
That many Chris and Merris
in the windshield--

14:14.087 --> 14:16.323
you got to figure
the car was here often.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.525
Could be our bomber's home base.
Let's take a look.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.293
All right, and, hey, while
you guys are there, can you

14:20.327 --> 14:21.895
pick me up some of that honey?
It's gonna take me

14:21.929 --> 14:24.197
a little while to get my hive
up and running.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.137
PRIDE:
Don, you can do this.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.039
DON:
Everywhere we go,

14:32.072 --> 14:33.673
we're looking over
our shoulders.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.176
At our house,
in my office.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.477
I go jogging.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.412
You know,
just to clear my head,

14:39.446 --> 14:41.614
relax, but all
I can think about

14:41.648 --> 14:43.951
is will today

14:43.984 --> 14:45.986
be the day that Garza kills me?

14:50.323 --> 14:53.526
PRIDE:
You came to us, Don.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.996
Said you wanted
to make this right.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.332
Look, I made the mistakes.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.301
I get that.

15:01.334 --> 15:05.172
But I need you to promise me
that there will come a day

15:05.205 --> 15:07.507
when Garza is behind
bars and my wife

15:07.540 --> 15:10.143
can go for a run without fear.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.217
I promise.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.686
I promise both of you.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.623
(music plays quietly
over radio)

15:28.161 --> 15:31.131
Check the front
pocket of my bag.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.967
Put something in there you
might find interesting.

15:34.001 --> 15:37.137
Take a look.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.611
DEA's got an ongoing
investigation

15:44.644 --> 15:47.614
into a drug dealer--
Marion Watkins.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.383
Buddy calls me, tells me one
of my agent's been spending

15:50.417 --> 15:54.121
a ton of time sitting outside
her house, wants to know

15:54.154 --> 15:57.157
if we got our own
operation going on.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.459
Marion.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.162
She's the friend
you told me about?

16:02.195 --> 16:04.564
So this car trip

16:04.597 --> 16:08.235
wasn't ever about quality time?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.037
This car trip

16:10.070 --> 16:12.039
was about how you
keep things hidden.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.042
No, personal
is different from hidden.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.577
Personal ends when
I'm put in a position

16:17.610 --> 16:20.047
to answer for your
actions and I can't

16:20.080 --> 16:21.748
because I don't know
what you're doing.

16:21.781 --> 16:25.318
Well, what if I don't know
what I'm doing?

16:25.352 --> 16:27.720
What's up with
you people wanting

16:27.754 --> 16:30.357
to yackity-yack
all the time?

16:30.390 --> 16:33.193
You know, I came here
to be an agent.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.063
Not to tell everyone
my every thought.

16:36.096 --> 16:39.599
"I take your heart in mine

16:39.632 --> 16:42.069
"and they become one,

16:42.102 --> 16:44.337
sustaining us both."

16:44.371 --> 16:46.339
Another one of Lambert's poems.

16:46.373 --> 16:50.277
Okay, you can trap me
in a box with wheels,

16:50.310 --> 16:53.413
but once you start
quoting poetry...

16:53.446 --> 16:57.317
I'm super out.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.420
Well, you can
duck me now,

17:00.453 --> 17:04.391
but it's gonna be a long
drive back to New Orleans.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.047
Open 103.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.050
I'll take it from here.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.196
What you looking at, Shawshank?

17:48.668 --> 17:51.438
So, I just sign right here?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.340
That's everything that you

17:53.373 --> 17:56.576
and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Izzo agreed to.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.712
Oh, no, this isn't
quite everything.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.551
Why don't we discuss the real
reason that you're here.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.421
Yes?

18:08.455 --> 18:10.190
I want an apology.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.526
Apology?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.162
For what?

18:15.195 --> 18:17.197
I'm in prison
'cause you made a deal

18:17.230 --> 18:18.698
with Don instead of me.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.568
AUSA made that choice.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.171
Oh... That was on your advice.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.538
So Don gets to get out

18:25.572 --> 18:27.674
and I had to spend my days
rotting in here.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.876
Don is dead.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.412
Another thing you probably

18:32.445 --> 18:34.814
should apologize for, no?

18:34.847 --> 18:37.217
Sign,

18:37.250 --> 18:39.319
stand up

18:39.352 --> 18:40.487
and let's go.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.190
No apology, no testify.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.858
So you can let Hugo Garza
go free and clear.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.438
I apologize.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.774
I apologize, Mr. Maslow.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.544
I apologize,
Mr. Maslow.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.316
Well, that's a good start.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.696
What happened to the last guy
that wore this?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.899
I shot him.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.642
BRODY:
Chris Lasalle,

19:35.675 --> 19:37.344
afraid of bees?

19:37.377 --> 19:38.711
Bees and heights.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.647
I guess everyone
has their weaknesses.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.215
It's not a weakness, Brody.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.418
Every sane person
has a cautious respect

19:45.452 --> 19:47.220
of insects with stingers

19:47.254 --> 19:49.256
and falls that might kill ya.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.694
WOMAN:
You're late, Frank.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.629
Frank?

19:56.663 --> 19:59.566
The name the car
was registered to.

20:01.901 --> 20:06.739
Ma'am... we're federal agents.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.608
Need you to step
out into the aisle.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.643
BRODY: Put your hands
where we can see 'em.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.951
Vivian?

20:18.985 --> 20:21.288
Agent Lasalle?

20:22.455 --> 20:24.724
You alone?

20:24.757 --> 20:27.026
Yeah. Why?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.562
We heard you mention
someone named Frank.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.799
Which is interesting,

20:32.832 --> 20:35.802
'cause that's the name of the
man that killed your husband.

20:45.712 --> 20:46.846
LASALLE:
Tell us about Frank.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.315
He's just a guy.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.450
Just a guy who gets
his own cell phone?

20:50.483 --> 20:52.952
'Cause this is the number
we have on file,

20:52.985 --> 20:55.888
and, this, I'm gonna guess,
isn't registered with WITSEC.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.690
We call that a burner.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.593
Burner phone,
only one contact.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.496
Frank.
Gonna ask you again, Vivian.

21:03.530 --> 21:06.966
Frank Jameson--
who is he to you?

21:06.999 --> 21:09.869
He's my sponsee.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.605
AA.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.342
You're meeting at
a secluded abbey.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.378
I have been sober for ten years.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.515
God, and for ten years,
I have been coming

21:22.549 --> 21:25.452
to the same meetings right here,
Tuesdays and Thursdays

21:25.485 --> 21:28.655
right in this chapel.
Well, why the secrecy?

21:28.688 --> 21:33.793
Because WITSEC said I should
cut off all ties to my old life.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.064
But this one,
I just couldn't do.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.599
And Frank?

21:39.632 --> 21:40.933
Frank's new to the group

21:40.967 --> 21:42.502
over these last few months.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.803
He's sweet.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.405
But clearly struggling,

21:45.438 --> 21:47.006
so we would meet here early and

21:47.039 --> 21:48.608
just talk, I swear.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.543
Let me guess.

21:50.577 --> 21:53.580
He sought you out?

21:53.613 --> 21:56.516
Asked you be his sponsor?
Yeah, but...

21:58.585 --> 22:01.354
No, I was careful.

22:01.388 --> 22:03.856
I didn't use my last name.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.425
You didn't have to.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.427
He knew who you
were, Ms. Lambert.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.496
He chose you.

22:09.529 --> 22:12.832
Wait. So, is it...?

22:12.865 --> 22:15.502
Is it my fault
that Don's dead?

22:16.736 --> 22:19.105
How's Vivian holding up?

22:19.138 --> 22:21.741
Since she blames herself for her
husband's death?

22:21.774 --> 22:22.975
Not so good.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.711
Her phone get
us anywhere?
Ow!

22:24.744 --> 22:26.979
We're pinging the number
that she was in contact with,

22:27.013 --> 22:28.848
hoping it will lead us
to this... Frank.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.718
Vivian also gave us
a physical description.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.453
We're running it
through Bruce now.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.021
MASLOW:
So, this is great.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.490
You drag me out of prison
with a full bladder,

22:37.524 --> 22:39.892
and now I have to relieve myself
downwind of cattle-- nice.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.594
PRIDE:
Cross-reference anyone

22:41.628 --> 22:43.396
Garza ever shook hands with.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.931
LASALLE:
It's what I'm doing now.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.866
But the guy seems
to be a phantom.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.401
If he's a phantom
working for Garza...

22:48.435 --> 22:50.470
MASLOW :
Want to take a peek?

22:50.503 --> 22:52.004
...he'll be coming for Maslow.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.640
How are you holding up, King?

22:53.673 --> 22:55.041
Should be in New Orleans
by nightfall.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.843
I'll take a pass,
thank you.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.145
Provided Percy doesn't
shoot Maslow herself.

22:59.178 --> 23:01.881
Brody's on her way
to Sebastian now.

23:01.914 --> 23:04.484
Getting an update
on the explosives.
Keep me posted.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.185
Keep yourselves safe.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.020
SEBASTIAN:
Okay, so three things:

23:08.054 --> 23:10.557
First, the bomb was triggered
by a remote detonator.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.625
And based on the video
that Lasalle found,

23:12.659 --> 23:14.994
the car that you saw driving
away would have absolutely been

23:15.027 --> 23:16.629
within range of
Lambert's vehicle.

23:16.663 --> 23:20.900
Second, the bomb
was powered by MX4.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.503
It's a water-gel based explosive
with industrial

23:23.536 --> 23:25.672
and seismic applications.
We know where the MX4 came from?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.574
I'm still working on that.
Okay, the third thing?

23:27.607 --> 23:29.108
I killed Chris.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.077
Chris as in Lasalle?

23:31.110 --> 23:34.013
Chris as in LaBee.

23:34.046 --> 23:37.517
There was an incident when
I tried to run further tests.

23:37.550 --> 23:40.152
We got into it,
and... he stung me.

23:42.489 --> 23:45.625
Ouch.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.594
Honestly, you know,
I think he was just depressed.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.195
It was one of
those classic

23:49.228 --> 23:50.530
death-by-scientist
kind of things.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.666
Chris.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.935
The person, I assume?
Yeah, gotta go.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.670
Okay. Hey, when
you see him,

23:57.704 --> 23:59.672
you'll tell him
it wasn't personal.

23:59.706 --> 24:02.241
I'll break it to him gently.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.976
Let's go.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.546
Hey! Come on.
That's a $500 shirt.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.948
Was a $500 shirt.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.517
Looks like someone
screwed it up.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.184
Yeah, one of the guards
ripped that button off,

24:12.218 --> 24:13.953
and now they've replaced it
with some

24:13.986 --> 24:15.822
cheap Taiwanese crap.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.124
Hey, your lady agent here--
she rushed me.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.959
I'm adding that
to the apology list.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.061
We're trying
to keep you alive.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.697
Do the two have to be
mutually exclusive?

24:24.731 --> 24:26.599
Watch your head.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.572
Any way we can make him ride
in the trunk?

24:34.273 --> 24:38.711
Just like the car, the phone
Vivian was texting was stolen.

24:38.745 --> 24:41.113
It was registered
to a Milton Howell.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.983
Only thing is,
Howell's 90 years old.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.685
Hasn't seen his cell
in months.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.721
Also claims that
the only person who had access

24:48.755 --> 24:50.623
was his handyman.
Let me guess.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.125
His handyman goes
by the name Frank.
Exactly.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.094
Phone's transmitting a signal.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.630
Coming from over here.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.706
Top apartment-- you get the
front, I got the fire exit.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.120
Going in.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.589
10-4.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.724
NCIS!

25:24.757 --> 25:26.025
Brody, get down!

25:30.897 --> 25:32.264
You good?

25:32.298 --> 25:34.133
Good.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.939
Booby-trap.
Watch for more of 'em.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.321
Clear.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.661
Brody, meet fake Frank.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.663
D.E.A.D.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.332
Looks like that car wreck
did some serious damage.

26:06.365 --> 26:07.700
What's this?

26:09.101 --> 26:10.336
It's a map of Texas.

26:10.369 --> 26:11.638
The back roads.

26:11.671 --> 26:12.672
BRODY:
Where Pride and Sonja are.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.807
He's tracking
Maslow's transfer.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.610
I'm calling King.
I'll alert the
local authorities.

26:17.644 --> 26:18.945
They'll need backup.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.755
Now what's this?

26:28.788 --> 26:32.191
You shouldn't have crossed
the double yellow back there.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.760
PRIDE:
AUSA was supposed to alert

26:33.793 --> 26:35.695
local jurisdictions about us.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.764
Want me to...?
Yes. Call.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.366
No signal.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.319
PRIDE:
No, something's off.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.287
Check the boots.

27:02.689 --> 27:03.856
Yeah, and they got something

27:03.890 --> 27:05.024
behind their backs.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.795
Ambush?
Are you kidding?

27:08.828 --> 27:10.196
Drive! Right now!
Get down!

27:32.318 --> 27:33.652
Wait for 'em to reload.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.058
Now.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.971
SONJA:
Where'd he go?

27:52.004 --> 27:53.272
PRIDE:
Looks like he's
in the woods.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.208
I'll go after the shooter.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.777
Check on Maslow.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.152
SONJA:
Pride!

28:09.055 --> 28:11.157
We got a problem.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.262
Where the hell'd he go?

28:28.474 --> 28:29.742
There's no signal.

28:29.776 --> 28:30.977
He probably jammed our phones.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.112
I can't call
for backup.
Guy's dead.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.781
Yeah, and his partner took off.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.183
Look like Maslow headed
into the woods back there.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.385
Could be more on the way.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.353
We gotta get to him
before someone else does.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.259
King, it's me again.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.428
Look, I need you
to call me back.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.030
The people responsible
for Lambert's death

28:51.063 --> 28:52.765
know where you are.

28:52.799 --> 28:54.934
You and Percy find a safe spot
and sit tight.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.535
Cavalry's on its way.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.904
BRODY: I'm at the office.
Call me as soon as you can.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.138
Straight to voicemail.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.040
Same with Sonja's phone.
We gotta go.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.341
Brody...
We leave now,

29:02.374 --> 29:04.010
drive as fast as we can,
we'll get there...

29:04.043 --> 29:06.545
They're still five
hours out. All right?

29:06.578 --> 29:08.414
Texas Rangers and U.S.
Marshals are on their way.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.282
The best thing
we can do for them now

29:10.316 --> 29:12.051
is to try to figure out
who put the track on 'em.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.352
Garza's people at the prison.

29:14.821 --> 29:16.088
Wade.

29:17.223 --> 29:18.290
Any word?

29:18.324 --> 29:19.458
Still waiting to hear.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.060
I've completed my autopsy

29:21.093 --> 29:22.294
on your bomber.

29:22.328 --> 29:23.562
Cause of death:

29:23.595 --> 29:25.464
untended injuries
from his accident.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.967
Brain swelled and he was toast.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.069
But that's not
what you care about.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.570
Identification.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.906
Hold that thought.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.342
Hey, I come bearing
news of explosives.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.477
Uh... Oh, that's crazy.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.446
You're across the hall,

29:40.479 --> 29:42.248
but you're also across the room.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.950
WADE:
Hang on, Sebastian,

29:43.983 --> 29:45.584
we're discussing identification.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.319
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
Uh, go ahead!

29:47.353 --> 29:49.922
I took the liberty of running

29:49.956 --> 29:51.090
the deceased's prints

29:51.123 --> 29:52.491
and I've uploaded it to you.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.961
Your bomber's name
is Ethan Greer.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.495
Ethan Greer.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.500
All right...

30:01.533 --> 30:03.469
Got a long criminal history--

30:03.502 --> 30:06.873
served time on weapons charges
in multiple states.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.841
Any ties to Garza?
Not that I can see here.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.342
All right, what do
you have, Sebastian?

30:10.376 --> 30:11.844
Hey, yeah. I'm over here now.

30:11.878 --> 30:13.212
Time-sensitive,
Sebastian.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.546
Okay, sorry. Yeah, uh...

30:14.580 --> 30:16.415
so I was finally able
to trace the origin

30:16.448 --> 30:18.951
of the MX4 used to blow up
Lambert's car.

30:18.985 --> 30:22.354
Lot number is XJ7-114,
but here's the thing:

30:22.388 --> 30:24.390
it's not the same grade
or manufacturer

30:24.423 --> 30:26.225
as the explosives
that Garza stole.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.527
In fact, these were swiped after
Garza was taken into custody.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.595
We'll take it from here.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.531
If the explosives
don't connect to Garza

30:32.564 --> 30:34.400
and the bomber
doesn't connect to Garza...

30:34.433 --> 30:37.169
...who the hell is after Maslow?

31:00.927 --> 31:02.494
Oh, that can't be good.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.872
You two leave me alone!

31:15.274 --> 31:16.943
Oh! Aah!

31:19.045 --> 31:21.447
And you know you're running
from the wrong people.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.149
Yeah, well, you two are doing

31:23.182 --> 31:25.084
a bang-up job of protecting me.

31:25.117 --> 31:26.418
Shut up. Unless you want
somebody to hear you

31:26.452 --> 31:27.920
and put a bullet
in your head.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.355
All right, all right,
I'm shutting up.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.123
Gunshots came from
back by the road.

31:31.157 --> 31:32.391
Can't go there.

31:32.424 --> 31:33.459
Yeah, and besides,
the car is junked.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.127
If I remember the map,

31:35.161 --> 31:37.063
interstate's about
a quarter of a mile...

31:37.096 --> 31:38.564
that way.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.966
All right, we get there,
maybe we can

31:39.999 --> 31:41.533
avoid their
signal jammer.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.969
Yeah, and get
some backup.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.671
That was U.S. Marshals.

31:45.704 --> 31:48.307
They're ten minutes out.
Anything?

31:48.340 --> 31:50.609
I'm struggling to make sense
of the notes on the MX4.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.344
All right.

31:52.378 --> 31:53.679
Let's pull it up on the plasma.

31:53.712 --> 31:55.214
LASALLE:
The explosives were stolen

31:55.247 --> 31:57.483
two months ago.
ATF has 'em, but...

31:57.516 --> 31:59.952
there's no
NCIS case number.

31:59.986 --> 32:01.553
Let me see if I can
download their report.

32:01.587 --> 32:02.955
Chris...
I know.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.156
There's a cross-reference.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.491
Chris.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.960
Look at this.

32:07.994 --> 32:10.596
The MX4 comes
from the same

32:10.629 --> 32:13.432
batch of explosives Zed
Hastings and the militia used

32:13.465 --> 32:15.734
to blow up
the G&L Bridge.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.603
Zed's been on the run,

32:17.636 --> 32:19.738
and now he's resurfaced.

32:19.771 --> 32:23.242
This has nothing
to do with Garza.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.743
Or Maslow.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.979
It's about getting Pride.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.597
Sic semper tyrannis.

32:49.035 --> 32:49.968
(speaking urgently
and indistinctly)

33:01.480 --> 33:05.017
HASTINGS:
It's been a long time,
Agent Pride!

33:05.051 --> 33:06.518
Shouldn't they be
shooting at him?

33:10.189 --> 33:11.557
They're not interested in him.

33:11.590 --> 33:12.624
What are you talking about?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.026
Zed Hastings.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.194
He's here for me.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.695
Well, good.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.630
Can the little agent lady
and I get the hell out of here?

33:18.664 --> 33:20.232
Will you shut up?

33:20.266 --> 33:21.433
He's right. I'll cover you.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.069
Get to the
interstate.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.437
I'm gonna double back
and head to the car.

33:25.471 --> 33:26.605
The car won't drive!

33:26.638 --> 33:28.040
You go.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.241
You get him to court.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.077
Because if you come
back here for me

33:31.110 --> 33:32.444
and I'm alive,

33:32.478 --> 33:34.213
I will fire your ass.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.216
On my count.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.751
Three... two... one.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.236
*

34:06.478 --> 34:08.214
HASTINGS:
Pride's in the car.

34:08.247 --> 34:09.548
We got him.

34:24.796 --> 34:27.233
What the...?
PRIDE:
NCIS!

34:28.834 --> 34:30.402
Aah!

34:36.575 --> 34:38.544
Go ahead, Zed.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.313
You want more?

34:47.286 --> 34:49.521
BRODY: Got an update
from Oschner Medical.

34:49.555 --> 34:50.956
Zed Hastings
is out of surgery.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.892
Critical, but stable.
All right, when he
comes to, I want to know.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.361
He's got intel we need.

34:55.394 --> 34:56.562
What foreign entities

34:56.595 --> 34:57.896
the militants are working with,

34:57.929 --> 34:59.531
how far and wide
this all goes.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.766
I still don't get this.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.534
Zed hires someone

35:02.568 --> 35:03.702
to blow up Lambert,

35:03.735 --> 35:05.271
puts Maslow in play,

35:05.304 --> 35:07.239
but how is he sure

35:07.273 --> 35:09.441
Maslow will testify
or request you?

35:09.475 --> 35:11.477
Done some research on that.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.715
I figured you'd
be sick of me by now.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.750
Trust me, I am.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.288
Cheap button on your shirt...

35:25.291 --> 35:26.725
...really a tracking device.

35:29.595 --> 35:30.529
Weird.

35:30.562 --> 35:31.830
Got another word
for you.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.865
Confluence.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.205
A flowing or coming together...

35:39.238 --> 35:41.873
a gathering
at one point.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.875
What the hell
are you talking about?

35:43.909 --> 35:47.579
One of my agents ran a check
on your cell block.

35:47.613 --> 35:50.949
Supremacist groups,
separatists...

35:50.982 --> 35:52.918
Zed Hastings' folks,

35:52.951 --> 35:54.920
many of whom, no doubt,
were talking about

35:54.953 --> 35:57.556
wanting to get even with
a federal agent that you knew

35:57.589 --> 36:00.459
all too well.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.495
You traded access to me...

36:03.529 --> 36:05.564
for your chance to escape.

36:08.900 --> 36:12.571
And then there's...
this man.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.706
Living under the name

36:14.740 --> 36:17.776
Frank Jameson,
but really Ethan Greer,

36:17.809 --> 36:20.212
who spent two months
in the same cell

36:20.246 --> 36:23.615
with Zed, back in 2009.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.484
But you knew all that,
didn't you?

36:27.619 --> 36:28.787
Confluence.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.889
Exactly.

36:30.922 --> 36:33.592
So, here's how this
is going to play out.

36:33.625 --> 36:37.496
You testify,
as planned, against Garza.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.632
You take 25 years
for your part

36:40.666 --> 36:42.501
in the murder
of Don Lambert.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.005
And that's it.

36:47.038 --> 36:51.310
Nothing for your
attempted escape...

36:51.343 --> 36:53.845
nothing for aiding and abetting
in the attempted murder

36:53.879 --> 36:56.348
of two federal agents.

36:56.382 --> 36:57.949
Why would you do that for me?

37:00.018 --> 37:01.587
Because Garza.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.789
Because Vivian Lambert.

37:03.822 --> 37:04.956
Because Don.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.828
Because I keep my promises.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.767
Oh, wait...
one more thing.

37:15.801 --> 37:19.004
I also...

37:19.037 --> 37:20.906
want an apology.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.811
I apologize.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.680
"I apologize, Mr. Pride."

37:28.714 --> 37:31.917
I apologize, Mr. Pride.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.324
It's a start.

37:40.025 --> 37:43.295
IZZO: Mr. Maslow,
can you please identify

37:43.329 --> 37:44.863
the man that you worked for,

37:44.896 --> 37:47.633
for whom you laundered the
profits of stolen Navy weaponry?

37:47.666 --> 37:49.468
Yes, I can.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.637
Is he in this room?

37:51.670 --> 37:52.838
Yes, he is.

37:52.871 --> 37:56.642
Can you please
identify him

37:56.675 --> 37:58.677
by name and
point him out?

37:59.878 --> 38:01.847
Hugo Garza.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.750
Please let the record show
that the witness

38:04.783 --> 38:06.452
has identified the defendant,

38:06.485 --> 38:08.387
Hugo Garza. There'll be
no further questions.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.400
We got him.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.868
:
Tonight...

38:22.901 --> 38:25.371
I am going for
a very long run.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.040
Thank you.

38:29.074 --> 38:31.076
Hey, Pride.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.513
I was, uh, wondering

38:34.546 --> 38:36.648
if you would sign
something for me.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.850
Permission for me
to be loaned out to DEA

38:38.884 --> 38:40.386
for an undercover
mission.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.953
Road trip too
much for you?

38:41.987 --> 38:43.355
Oh...

38:43.389 --> 38:44.890
No, my friend, Marion.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.660
You want to be a part
of taking her down?

38:48.694 --> 38:50.696
Look, it's the only way
I can help her.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.398
Get her into rehab,
get her out of the life.

38:52.431 --> 38:53.599
Think she'll
go for it?

38:53.632 --> 38:55.801
How the hell do I know?

38:55.834 --> 38:57.736
You were willing to get shot at

38:57.769 --> 38:59.070
all over Texas
based a promise.

38:59.104 --> 39:02.774
I'd like to give
this a try.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.444
"I took her heart in mine
and they became one,

39:05.477 --> 39:07.479
sustaining us both."

39:09.180 --> 39:10.716
You're quoting poetry?

39:10.749 --> 39:12.418
Yeah.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.420
It's the first and last time,

39:14.453 --> 39:16.422
but from here forward,

39:16.455 --> 39:18.490
I'd like to get better
with the yackity-yack.

39:18.524 --> 39:20.559
This is me

39:20.592 --> 39:22.561
asking permission.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.532
Give me the paperwork.

39:27.666 --> 39:28.934
I'll sign it.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.480
MAN:
Hello, Zed.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.051
I've been expecting you.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.487
Pride's still alive.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.122
You're going to jail.

39:51.156 --> 39:53.625
So it's my turn.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.994
Sic semper
tyrannis.
