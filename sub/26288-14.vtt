WEBVTT

00:04.214 --> 00:05.546
<i>What's it called?</i>

00:05.615 --> 00:09.050
It was just released.
It's called a "web browser."

00:09.118 --> 00:11.519
Cool name. What is it?
A new development stack?

00:11.588 --> 00:14.722
No. You use it to connect
to something called...

00:14.791 --> 00:16.657
the Internet.

00:16.726 --> 00:19.494
And then what?
Watch.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.333
Is that the
phone company?

00:25.401 --> 00:27.702
It's their website, yeah.

00:27.770 --> 00:29.237
Wait.

00:29.305 --> 00:31.906
Are you tunneling
into their backend servers?

00:31.975 --> 00:34.275
Yup. I figured out a way

00:34.344 --> 00:36.611
to make long-distance
phone calls for free.

00:36.679 --> 00:38.779
Oh, my God.

00:38.848 --> 00:42.250
Do you know how much money
we could make?

00:44.120 --> 00:48.289
I just want to be able to call
my dad when he's on deployment.

00:48.358 --> 00:52.527
I hear you, but...

00:52.595 --> 00:54.762
do you know how much money
we could make?

01:02.138 --> 01:03.471
Do it for your dad

01:03.540 --> 01:06.140
and the extra
pocket change.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.218 --> 01:16.417
Oops.

01:16.486 --> 01:19.220
Timothy McGee!
What did you do now?

01:21.658 --> 01:25.658

01:52.088 --> 01:55.489
- So what did your mom do?
- Grounded me for a week.

01:55.558 --> 01:56.991
Can't believe
you still have it.

01:57.060 --> 01:59.460
Yeah, it's the first
PC I ever built.

01:59.529 --> 02:02.263
- Made me realize that...
- You would never have a girlfriend?

02:02.332 --> 02:04.498
Um, I've had plenty
of girlfriends, thank you.

02:04.567 --> 02:06.200
Yeah, one even helped
him build this.

02:07.403 --> 02:09.704
No, actually that was
just a "girl-dash-friend."

02:09.771 --> 02:10.937
Oh.

02:11.007 --> 02:13.674
Oh, so, like,
"pathetic-dash-disturbing."

02:13.743 --> 02:15.823
I pulled this bad boy
out of the mothballs last week,

02:15.878 --> 02:17.478
see if I could get
the twins started

02:17.547 --> 02:19.280
on computer science early.

02:19.349 --> 02:21.949
Well, it's a really nice design.

02:22.018 --> 02:24.285
Well, the twins had
other ideas. Morgan threw up

02:24.354 --> 02:26.287
on the CPU and Johnny
peed on the hard drive.

02:26.356 --> 02:27.455
Okay.

02:27.523 --> 02:30.057
I'm gonna see if I can get Kasie
to help me fix it.

02:30.126 --> 02:32.360
Good luck with that.
She's hiding.

02:32.428 --> 02:33.728
Hiding? From what?

02:33.796 --> 02:35.997
- I hope you kept records.
- Him.

02:36.065 --> 02:39.133
This is insane. I've never
been audited in my life.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.402
Well, if it makes you feel
better, it wasn't just you.

02:41.471 --> 02:43.537
Agent Gibbs' entire team
was sloppy

02:43.606 --> 02:45.139
with their expense reports.
What?

02:45.208 --> 02:47.308
Wait, what?
We're being audited?

02:47.377 --> 02:49.377
Did you think I was organizing
my receipts for fun?

02:49.412 --> 02:50.978
No, that's something that dorks

02:51.047 --> 02:52.687
who build their own
computers do.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.315
I hope you have
a receipt for that.

02:56.052 --> 02:57.251
I'm sorry, who are you?

02:57.320 --> 03:00.154
Dick Sullivan.
Deputy Inspector General, DoD.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.322
Does Gibbs know
about this?

03:01.391 --> 03:02.423
Rule 99.

03:02.492 --> 03:05.526
"Never tell Gibbs
he's being audited."

03:05.595 --> 03:08.763
That's not a real thing.
Dead body. Gear up.

03:08.831 --> 03:12.900
Um... Um, no, no, no,
wait. Um...

03:12.969 --> 03:14.735
Still need to get, uh...

03:14.804 --> 03:17.571
I still need everyone's...

03:21.577 --> 03:23.344
This is the third
Navy contractor

03:23.413 --> 03:25.846
to drop dead this year.
Got bruises on his neck.

03:27.050 --> 03:29.617
Hey, can I borrow a pen?
No way. Get your own.

03:29.686 --> 03:32.119
What? Since when did you
become a pen Nazi?

03:32.188 --> 03:34.622
Since I found out that pens
are not expensable.

03:34.691 --> 03:36.090
That's crazy.

03:36.159 --> 03:37.970
Yeah, you know what's crazy
is that my protein powder

03:37.994 --> 03:39.126
is not expensable,
either.

03:39.195 --> 03:41.228
Yeah, I would file
that one under "duh."

03:43.433 --> 03:45.633
Ranger found the body
about an hour ago.

03:45.702 --> 03:46.867
Witnesses?

03:46.936 --> 03:48.414
They canvassed
nearby campgrounds,

03:48.438 --> 03:49.570
no one saw anything.

03:49.639 --> 03:52.239
Think this belongs
to our murderer?

03:52.308 --> 03:54.909
Well, it's a shovel, McGee.
It's-it's by a dead body.

03:54.977 --> 03:56.110
You tell me.

03:56.179 --> 03:57.745
Ground's frozen,

03:57.814 --> 03:59.280
killer gave up.

03:59.348 --> 04:02.149
So what do we have here?

04:02.218 --> 04:04.585
Dead Navy contractor.

04:04.654 --> 04:06.098
That's the third
one this year.

04:06.122 --> 04:08.200
Am I the only one that doesn't
keep track of these things?

04:08.224 --> 04:10.758
This looks like...

04:10.827 --> 04:12.460
strangulation.

04:12.528 --> 04:13.728
And this...

04:16.165 --> 04:18.565
Not my department.
Agent Bishop, if you would.

04:18.634 --> 04:19.767
Mm-hmm.

04:19.836 --> 04:22.002
- What do we got?
- An empty notebook.

04:22.071 --> 04:25.940
Pages torn out. Oh, wait.

04:26.008 --> 04:27.441
I see some indentations.

04:27.510 --> 04:31.078
- Oh.
- You know pens are not expensable.

04:31.147 --> 04:33.280
All right,
I got some numbers here.

04:33.349 --> 04:35.483
"4, 20,

04:35.551 --> 04:37.952
19, 94."

04:38.020 --> 04:40.588
That's funny. That's the exact
same date that I got my, uh...

04:40.656 --> 04:41.789
Z28?

04:42.859 --> 04:44.992
Yeah, back when
I lived in...

04:45.061 --> 04:46.527
Hampstead?

04:48.097 --> 04:49.764
Uh...

04:49.832 --> 04:52.767
Can someone explain to me
what just happened?

04:52.835 --> 04:54.935
That's one of my old
computer passwords.

04:57.373 --> 04:59.039
Well, McGee, why does a dead guy

04:59.108 --> 05:02.510
have one of your old computer
passwords in his pocket?

05:10.908 --> 05:13.042
Edward Kane, 45.

05:13.110 --> 05:15.044
Worked at the Defense
Payroll Service at DoD.

05:15.112 --> 05:16.412
Bean counter.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.814
Been missing since Thursday,
and Jimmy says

05:18.883 --> 05:20.883
he's been dead
for about four days.

05:20.952 --> 05:23.519
- McGee?
- Boss, I don't know the name.

05:23.588 --> 05:25.487
I've never seen this guy
before in my life.

05:25.556 --> 05:28.190
He knows you,
or at least your password.

05:28.259 --> 05:30.392
Unless it's
a coincidence.

05:30.461 --> 05:32.361
Do you know the odds
of a 19-digit string

05:32.430 --> 05:34.496
randomly matching your...

05:34.565 --> 05:37.032
9,000,652,000
to one, yes.

05:37.101 --> 05:38.701
What do we got?

05:38.769 --> 05:40.869
Phone records.
Nothing too exciting.

05:40.938 --> 05:42.905
Bunch of calls to mom,
sis, yada yada,

05:42.974 --> 05:46.575
but the last call that Kane made
before he disappeared...

05:46.644 --> 05:49.678
is really interesting, to a high
school in the middle of nowhere.

05:49.747 --> 05:52.047
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Don't tell me it's yours.

05:52.116 --> 05:55.017
Well, one of them. We moved
every time my dad transferred.

05:55.086 --> 05:56.930
You sure you didn't go
to high school with this guy?

05:56.954 --> 05:58.287
Boss, I'm-I'm positive

05:58.356 --> 06:00.100
that I did not go to high school
with this guy.

06:00.124 --> 06:01.590
I remember everyone
at the school.

06:01.659 --> 06:03.359
I couldn't get out
of there fast enough.

06:03.427 --> 06:07.096
Well, I have an awesome feeling
that, uh, you're going back.

06:09.634 --> 06:12.701
It is SAT prep time.

06:12.770 --> 06:14.470
Juniors and seniors,
you can sign up...

06:14.538 --> 06:16.372
So I talked to
the front office.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.540
Uh, Kane called,
asked to talk to the guy

06:18.609 --> 06:20.075
who runs
the computer lab,

06:20.144 --> 06:22.111
an Andrew Lewis.

06:22.179 --> 06:24.446
You're kidding. Mr. Lewis?

06:24.515 --> 06:25.881
Can't believe he's still here.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.283
Yeah, I was never really a fan,

06:27.351 --> 06:28.671
but I'm sure
the guy remembers me.

06:28.719 --> 06:31.487
Oh, Mr. Lewis.
Yeah, and who are you?

06:31.555 --> 06:34.623
It's me, Tim McGee.
Doesn't ring a bell.

06:34.692 --> 06:35.958
Made quite
an impression.

06:36.027 --> 06:38.227
I was in your computer class
senior year.

06:38.296 --> 06:39.728
I was actually
top of your class.

06:39.797 --> 06:41.563
You judged
a talent show

06:41.632 --> 06:42.931
that I tried out for.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.634
Oh, right, sure. It's, um...
Tim.

06:45.703 --> 06:47.469
McGee. Yeah.
McGee.

06:47.538 --> 06:51.073
I'm Special Agent
Nick Torres. NCIS.

06:51.142 --> 06:52.862
I'm actually late
for a rehearsal right now.

06:52.910 --> 06:56.612
We're doing <i>Cats,</i> again,
so, um, if you could, uh...

06:56.681 --> 06:58.525
Ask you a few questions
while we're standing here?

06:58.549 --> 07:00.115
Yeah, I like
the idea.

07:01.986 --> 07:04.687
Okay, um, this really is...

07:04.755 --> 07:06.867
Our records show that last week
you talked to an Edward Kane.

07:06.891 --> 07:10.292
Mm... No. No, I didn't.

07:10.361 --> 07:12.361
Uh, in fact, I've never
heard the name before.

07:12.430 --> 07:14.596
So you don't know this guy?

07:14.665 --> 07:18.267
No. Anything else?

07:18.336 --> 07:22.504
You should pay more attention
to your star pupils.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.308
Top of the class here.
We'll be in touch.

07:32.717 --> 07:33.849
What do you think?

07:33.918 --> 07:36.151
I think I can't believe
he doesn't remember me.

07:36.220 --> 07:37.900
Seems a little squirrelly,
don't you think?

07:37.955 --> 07:39.688
Yeah, he's definitely
hiding something.

07:39.757 --> 07:41.190
I'm not surprised, though.

07:41.258 --> 07:43.058
To be honest,
I never really liked the guy.

07:43.127 --> 07:45.027
Seems like you guys
had some history.

07:45.096 --> 07:47.996
Yeah, you could say that.

07:52.636 --> 07:55.838
Wow. Pretty sharp.

07:55.906 --> 07:58.173
And expensive-looking.

07:58.242 --> 08:00.642
Well, I worked all
summer for them.

08:00.711 --> 08:02.177
Selling free long-distance

08:02.246 --> 08:04.046
would've been an easier way
to make a buck.

08:04.115 --> 08:06.382
Easier way
to go to jail.

08:06.450 --> 08:07.916
Well, that summer gig
was worth it.

08:07.985 --> 08:10.552
You look great.

08:14.291 --> 08:16.592
Too bad you suck.

08:16.660 --> 08:17.993
Please. They don't call me

08:18.062 --> 08:19.728
"Timothy Soft Shoes
Savant McGee"

08:19.797 --> 08:20.929
for nothing.

08:20.998 --> 08:23.332
You're the only one
who calls you that.

08:23.401 --> 08:25.401
Who's on deck?
Me, Mr. Lewis.

08:26.737 --> 08:30.339
Ah. One minute.

08:31.742 --> 08:35.510
So what's it gonna be
next year in college?

08:35.578 --> 08:37.044
Gonna go for
the big leagues?

08:37.114 --> 08:40.015
I was actually thinking
about majoring in writing.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.784
What do you think?
Pretty crazy?

08:42.852 --> 08:45.954
I think it's a great idea,

08:46.023 --> 08:48.257
but it's not me you
need to worry about.

08:48.325 --> 08:52.127
I know. "Son, every McGee
since the last millennium

08:52.196 --> 08:53.562
has gone into the Navy."

08:53.631 --> 08:55.364
You should just tell him no.

08:55.433 --> 08:58.434
Chloe, he's not exactly the guy
who takes no for an answer.

08:58.502 --> 09:01.103
Maybe you should listen to him.

09:01.172 --> 09:02.771
Well, I'm just judging
by what I hear

09:02.840 --> 09:04.473
your English
teachers say

09:04.542 --> 09:06.708
and how well you did
in the talent show last year.

09:08.145 --> 09:09.912
Thanks for the encouragement?

09:09.980 --> 09:12.114
I'm just saying that talent
is a real thing,

09:12.183 --> 09:14.316
not everybody has it.

09:14.385 --> 09:17.553
You should find out what
you're good at, just do that.

09:19.857 --> 09:21.757
I mean, what kind of teacher
doesn't nurture

09:21.826 --> 09:23.725
a budding flower,
you know?

09:23.794 --> 09:25.060
Alcohol wipes, babe.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.563
Well, turned out all right,
didn't it?

09:27.631 --> 09:29.097
Well, I don't know
about that.

09:29.166 --> 09:32.501
Haven't tapped since college,
and I'm a failure as a writer.

09:32.570 --> 09:34.269
You wrote a best seller, Tim.

09:34.338 --> 09:36.305
Yeah, that was, uh,
ten years ago,

09:36.373 --> 09:39.475
and it was two best sellers,
by the way. Torx driver.

09:39.543 --> 09:42.077
I thought you were happy
at NCIS.

09:42.146 --> 09:44.079
I am. It's just...

09:44.148 --> 09:47.115
Last thing I wanted to do
as a kid was join the Navy.

09:47.184 --> 09:48.184
And you didn't.

09:48.219 --> 09:49.818
You know, I don't fight
for the Navy,

09:49.887 --> 09:52.654
but I am a cop for it.

09:57.528 --> 09:59.027
Um, Tim, what is it doing?

10:00.831 --> 10:01.997
Oh.

10:02.066 --> 10:05.801
Looks like it's opening up
an Internet Relay Chat.

10:05.870 --> 10:07.469
On its own?

10:07.538 --> 10:09.805
And IRC? Who uses that anymore?

10:11.709 --> 10:15.010
Timothy, why is your computer
talking to you?

10:15.079 --> 10:17.112
I'm sorry, did I get here
before you?

10:17.181 --> 10:19.681
Don't just sit there,
uh, ask it.

10:21.785 --> 10:23.485
Who is this?

10:28.292 --> 10:30.325
Is this really creepy,
or is it just me?

10:30.394 --> 10:31.394
No, it's not just you.

10:31.462 --> 10:33.295
Ask it what it wants.
Okay.

10:33.364 --> 10:36.131
"What do you want?"

10:39.904 --> 10:42.204
"No."

10:42.273 --> 10:43.572
Don't say that.

10:43.641 --> 10:44.907
What? Why?
Because clearly,

10:44.975 --> 10:46.808
whoever that is
wants you to be alone,

10:46.877 --> 10:49.077
so let them think you are alone.

10:49.146 --> 10:50.679
Okay, okay.

10:50.748 --> 10:53.248
Yes. I'm alone.

10:59.256 --> 11:01.256
Go to the kids, now.
Tim...

11:01.325 --> 11:02.602
Someone could be
in the building.

11:02.626 --> 11:04.059
Call Gibbs.

11:04.128 --> 11:06.228
Actually, call 911,
then call Gibbs.

11:06.297 --> 11:08.230
Be careful.

11:14.071 --> 11:15.404
NCIS.

11:15.472 --> 11:17.039
If someone's out there,

11:17.107 --> 11:19.241
come out now
with your hands on your head.

11:24.982 --> 11:27.382
Tim!

11:29.820 --> 11:31.253
Delilah?

11:39.630 --> 11:41.229
Delilah?!

11:48.833 --> 11:50.967
So I went back for the kids,
like Tim said,

11:51.036 --> 11:54.570
and a, a minute later,
I heard a noise in the kitchen.

11:54.639 --> 11:56.759
Yeah, well, it looks like
the intruder came in through

11:56.808 --> 11:58.374
the guest room window.
- All right.

11:58.443 --> 12:00.710
Bag and tag
everything he touched.

12:00.779 --> 12:04.247
So I thought Tim had come back,
but when I went to check,

12:04.316 --> 12:05.882
that's when I saw him,

12:05.950 --> 12:07.583
and that's
when I screamed.

12:07.652 --> 12:09.986
And then a second later,
I heard gunshots.

12:10.055 --> 12:11.421
You recognize him?

12:13.124 --> 12:14.824
Okay, I'll let her know.

12:14.893 --> 12:17.760
- Hey.
- Your mom says the twins are already asleep.

12:17.829 --> 12:19.273
So that's all it takes,
just a little shooting.

12:19.297 --> 12:20.830
We should do this every day.

12:20.899 --> 12:23.166
Sorry, but McGee, uh,
hit the limit of how many people

12:23.234 --> 12:26.002
he can shoot in his apartment.

12:28.173 --> 12:29.839
What's he talking about?

12:29.908 --> 12:32.008
I do not know.
Um, but I have packed

12:32.077 --> 12:33.843
your bag here,
ready to go to your mom's.

12:33.912 --> 12:35.945
What is he talking about?
Not a big deal,

12:36.014 --> 12:39.916
all right, but couple of years
ago, while you were in Dubai,

12:39.984 --> 12:41.818
there was a break-in
here at the apartment,

12:41.886 --> 12:44.954
and, um, I shot someone.

12:45.023 --> 12:47.023
In our apartment?

12:47.092 --> 12:49.359
- Yeah.
- And you failed to mention that to me?

12:50.595 --> 12:52.462
Ah, don't look at me, pal.

12:52.530 --> 12:53.530
Good luck with that, man.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.164
Bishop, little help?

12:55.233 --> 12:57.133
Nope.
You are on your own, McGee.

12:59.204 --> 13:01.604
Not really a big fan
of secrets right now.

13:01.673 --> 13:03.005
Okay, let's hear it.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.774
Look, I just, I didn't
want you to worry.

13:04.843 --> 13:06.887
Well, now I'm worrying
for a whole new set of reasons.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.511
Like, what else
aren't you telling me?

13:08.580 --> 13:10.391
Nothing. I'm not hiding
anything from you at all.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.948
No. I swear. Scout's honor.

13:12.016 --> 13:14.884
So, is it, uh,
is it just the one,

13:14.953 --> 13:16.352
or did you guys
find another

13:16.421 --> 13:18.788
mummified body under the bed?

13:20.692 --> 13:22.024
Okay, hang on, hang on.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.292
I might have
failed to mention

13:23.361 --> 13:25.661
there was also
a mummified body, but...

13:25.730 --> 13:27.330
Mum...
Hang on.

13:27.399 --> 13:29.065
We have bigger fish to fry,

13:29.134 --> 13:30.177
like finding out why this guy

13:30.201 --> 13:32.068
tried to lure me
out of the apartment,

13:32.137 --> 13:35.071
and what was he after?
I'm guessing this.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.907
My old computer?

13:39.210 --> 13:40.721
Why would anyone want
your old computer?

13:40.745 --> 13:42.645
I have no idea. Until last week,

13:42.714 --> 13:44.258
I hadn't turned it on
since high school.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.122
And what were you doing with it
in high school?

13:47.652 --> 13:49.719
You want a piece of this?

13:49.788 --> 13:51.988
How about this?

13:52.056 --> 13:53.990
Dinner's ready!

13:54.058 --> 13:55.992
In a minute, Mom!

13:56.060 --> 13:57.660
I'm doing my homework!

13:57.729 --> 13:59.262
Tim!

13:59.330 --> 14:00.530
Mom!

14:00.598 --> 14:03.032
♪ Is that the way we stand? ♪

14:03.101 --> 14:06.102
♪ Were you lying all the time? ♪

14:06.171 --> 14:08.838

14:08.907 --> 14:10.673

14:13.011 --> 14:18.214

GIBBS: <i>McGee.</i>

14:20.185 --> 14:22.952
You know, boss, I can't think
of anything I did with

14:23.021 --> 14:25.288
this computer that's relevant
to what's going on here.

14:33.097 --> 14:35.031
Aw, man.

14:35.099 --> 14:36.799
Looks like we missed her.

14:36.868 --> 14:38.935
She's probably
on a coffee break.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.270
At 8:00 a.m.?
Mm-hmm.

14:41.339 --> 14:45.274
Well, I hope she doesn't try to
expense any venti double lattes.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.211
It was a single
and I was on a stakeout

14:48.279 --> 14:51.080
and I needed the boost
to stay awake.

14:51.149 --> 14:53.282
Officially.

14:57.322 --> 14:59.055
Hey.

14:59.123 --> 15:00.456
Coast is clear.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.158
I owe you one.
Well,

15:02.227 --> 15:03.993
you can pay me back
with an update.

15:04.062 --> 15:05.962
Ooh. One venti update...

15:06.030 --> 15:07.396
coming right up.

15:07.465 --> 15:08.898
Starting with this.

15:08.967 --> 15:11.968
Our dead guy's prints
are all over it,

15:12.036 --> 15:13.196
but I don't think he drew it.

15:13.238 --> 15:14.837
I lifted a partial
that wasn't his,

15:14.906 --> 15:17.740
where you would've expected the
artist to be holding the page.

15:17.809 --> 15:19.775
You got an I.D.?
Mm, not yet.

15:19.844 --> 15:23.513
I was able to I.D.
our latest dead guy.

15:23.581 --> 15:25.648
Braxton Ballard, 25.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.350
Ooh. McGee almost
had a heart attack

15:27.418 --> 15:28.784
when he looked up his record.

15:28.853 --> 15:30.753
Why?
Oh, arson,

15:30.822 --> 15:32.421
grand theft, kidnapping.

15:32.490 --> 15:33.868
Just the kind of guy
you want crawling

15:33.892 --> 15:35.157
through your kids' window.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.592
So were we able
to figure out

15:36.661 --> 15:38.372
how this Braxton guy
hacked into my computer?

15:38.396 --> 15:40.363
Actually, I don't
think it was him.

15:40.431 --> 15:43.099
I was able to backtrace
the IRC chat.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.501
Whoever you were talking to was
on the other side of town.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.169
So Braxton was working
with somebody.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.605
Or maybe a hired gun.
That's more his M.O.

15:49.674 --> 15:51.440
Okay, so who hired him?

15:51.509 --> 15:53.109
Let me see the exact location.

15:53.177 --> 15:55.511
I'm having a hard time
narrowing down the area.

15:55.580 --> 15:59.115
There's some weird
corruption in the IRC

15:59.183 --> 16:01.484
data stream that's messing
with my mojo.

16:01.553 --> 16:03.119
But I'm working on it.

16:03.187 --> 16:06.289
Well, work harder, 'cause
someone wanted this bad enough

16:06.357 --> 16:08.824
they were willing to break into
a federal agent's apartment

16:08.893 --> 16:10.226
to steal it.

16:10.295 --> 16:11.494
I need to know why.

16:11.563 --> 16:14.130
Yeah, well,
it's your computer, McGee,

16:14.198 --> 16:16.499
so what do you think it is?

16:31.382 --> 16:34.850
I don't think you've moved
since I left.

16:34.919 --> 16:37.987
Commander.
When did you get back?

16:38.056 --> 16:39.755
The <i>Eisenhower</i> docked
this morning.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.757
Are we moving again?

16:41.826 --> 16:43.326
Eventually.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.408
Do you know when?
Why?

16:59.477 --> 17:01.956
Are you scared you're not gonna
make it to your big talent show?

17:01.980 --> 17:04.847
Your mother told me.

17:04.915 --> 17:07.116
Look, Dad,
only 15 people were accepted.

17:07.185 --> 17:10.118
I don't give a rat's ass
how many people were accepted.

17:10.188 --> 17:12.387
This is not where you should be
focusing your energies.

17:12.457 --> 17:14.757
It's just one show.
It's an embarrassment.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.393
You should be joining JROTC
or learning to sail,

17:17.462 --> 17:19.362
instead of prancing around...

17:19.430 --> 17:21.364
What if I don't want to?

17:26.771 --> 17:28.704
Don't want to what?

17:31.676 --> 17:33.609
Let me tell you something, boy.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.811
The Navy made me
the man I am today.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.446
And from what I see,

17:37.515 --> 17:39.882
you need more than a little bit
of character building.

17:39.951 --> 17:42.918
Generations of McGees have
fought for their country.

17:42.987 --> 17:45.321
Fought!

17:45.390 --> 17:47.623
And for God's sake,
that's what you're going to do.

17:54.232 --> 17:56.932
Gentlemen, I don't want
to judge your life choices here,

17:57.001 --> 17:59.669
but may I suggest, should you
two meet up in the next one,

17:59.737 --> 18:01.804
you opt for some sort
of mediation

18:01.873 --> 18:05.007
or other professional
conflict resolution service.

18:05.076 --> 18:07.476
Meet again?
Yes.

18:07.545 --> 18:12.114
I am proud to say
that I have solved this case.

18:12.183 --> 18:13.749
Well, good,
'cause we're stuck.

18:13.818 --> 18:15.151
We were hoping you
had something.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.753
Well, may I introduce to you
Edward Kane.

18:17.822 --> 18:19.382
Found strangled to death
just yesterday.

18:19.424 --> 18:20.589
Yeah, we met.

18:20.658 --> 18:22.591
Well, that means
that you have also met

18:22.660 --> 18:24.193
the man who killed him.

18:24.262 --> 18:27.430
Aka Braxton Ballard,
the hoodlum foolish enough

18:27.498 --> 18:30.433
to go toe-to-toe with
Special Agent Timothy McGee.

18:30.501 --> 18:33.002
So Braxton killed our victim.
Are you sure?

18:33.071 --> 18:36.839
100%. Confirmed with touch DNA.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.108
Why?
Uh, because touch DNA

18:39.177 --> 18:41.137
is the best way...
No, why did this guy kill Kane?

18:41.179 --> 18:42.845
What's that?

18:42.914 --> 18:44.892
Palmer, what's the connection
between these two men?

18:44.916 --> 18:47.349
- Uh...
- And why was Braxton after my old computer,

18:47.418 --> 18:49.952
just a week after I pulled it
out of storage?

18:50.021 --> 18:53.489
O-Okay, okay, so-so, uh, maybe

18:53.558 --> 18:55.458
I haven't
solved the case.

18:55.526 --> 18:58.627
Because I have no idea why he
would want McGee's old computer.

18:58.696 --> 19:00.396
Me, neither, but...

19:00.465 --> 19:03.132
your computer is doing something
really weird right now,

19:03.201 --> 19:05.801
and I wanted you to see
it before it stopped.

19:05.870 --> 19:08.337
It happened the second
I plugged it into the Internet.

19:10.742 --> 19:12.208
McGee?

19:12.276 --> 19:13.576
Boss, that is not possible.

19:13.644 --> 19:15.511
If I didn't know better,
I'd say your computer

19:15.580 --> 19:19.014
is trying to connect
to some sort of remote virus.

19:19.083 --> 19:22.818
It is. One designed to take down
the Department of Defense.

19:22.887 --> 19:25.521
Really? What--
and how do you know that?

19:26.891 --> 19:29.158
Well, because I wrote it.

19:38.596 --> 19:41.615
This is what the guy you killed

19:41.616 --> 19:43.315
tried to steal
from your apartment?

19:43.384 --> 19:44.483
Yes.

19:44.552 --> 19:45.584
And you built this?

19:45.653 --> 19:47.720
I did. Back in high school,
yes, sir.

19:47.788 --> 19:50.200
And then programmed it to attack
the United States government?

19:50.224 --> 19:52.424
No. No, just, um...

19:53.895 --> 19:55.394
...the Department of Defense.

19:55.463 --> 19:56.996
- Why?
- Well,

19:57.064 --> 19:59.331
um...

19:59.400 --> 20:02.735
So the baud rate's only 8K,

20:02.803 --> 20:05.404
but at seven bps...

20:05.473 --> 20:07.573
You can hit up
to 56 kilobytes per second.

20:07.642 --> 20:10.176
A meg
in three minutes.

20:10.244 --> 20:12.344
Rad.
Booyah.

20:14.248 --> 20:16.348
So are we gonna talk about
the other day?

20:18.486 --> 20:20.519
Tim?
I'm trying to ignore you.

20:20.588 --> 20:22.521
♪ I feel you... ♪

20:22.590 --> 20:24.323

Yeah, we should probably talk.

With our mouths.

you're graduating soon

20:54.555 --> 20:57.690
and I have no idea if you're
gonna be around next year

20:57.758 --> 21:00.459

21:05.266 --> 21:07.366
Navy's his thing.

21:07.435 --> 21:09.168
I'm not gonna give up

21:09.237 --> 21:11.077

- Happy?

21:15.610 --> 21:17.176
Dad.

21:17.245 --> 21:19.078
Chloe. He'll see you tomorrow.

21:29.156 --> 21:30.522
Dad, look, I-I didn't mean...

21:30.591 --> 21:32.891
Is that what you think
this is about, boy?

21:32.960 --> 21:34.893
Making me happy?

21:34.962 --> 21:36.495
This is about you.

21:36.564 --> 21:37.896
How is it about me?

21:39.634 --> 21:41.500
I get seasick just
looking at a boat

21:41.569 --> 21:44.169
and you want me to join the Navy.
- I want you to be a man.

21:44.238 --> 21:46.338
I am a man.
You're a child.

21:46.407 --> 21:48.107
And you're weak.

21:48.175 --> 21:50.676
You're wasting your time
on pipe dreams.

21:50.745 --> 21:53.078
The military
will make you strong.

21:53.147 --> 21:55.614
You know what?
I hear that a lot from you.

21:55.683 --> 21:57.349
So tell me how.

21:57.418 --> 21:59.018
And I don't mean
vague comments

21:59.086 --> 22:00.853
about how war will
build character.

22:00.921 --> 22:03.522
You tell me that Vietnam
made you the man you are.

22:03.591 --> 22:05.151
But you haven't even
told me a single...

22:19.040 --> 22:20.606
<i>And he took those shoes outside</i>

22:20.675 --> 22:22.107
<i>and burned them.</i>

22:22.176 --> 22:24.743
I spent all summer
working to pay for those.

22:24.812 --> 22:26.211
And that's why
you made the virus.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.113
To get even with your father.

22:28.182 --> 22:30.316
Yeah. I was in
computer lab.

22:30.384 --> 22:32.318
I was just a kid
blowing off steam.

22:32.386 --> 22:33.552
I never actually
even ran it.

22:33.621 --> 22:35.220
Yeah? Well, it's running now.

22:35.289 --> 22:36.822
Miss Hines says
it looks like

22:36.891 --> 22:39.091
there's a copy
running inside of DoD.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.292
Yes, and it's trying

22:40.361 --> 22:41.972
to phone home to my computer
for some reason.

22:41.996 --> 22:43.128
What is this virus doing?

22:43.197 --> 22:44.396
I have no idea.

22:44.465 --> 22:45.764
It looks like
it's been modified.

22:45.833 --> 22:48.233
And I have no idea how
it got loose. I mean,

22:48.302 --> 22:50.736
I'd forgotten I'd even written
it until I saw it in Autopsy.

22:50.805 --> 22:52.571
We know how long
this thing's been running?

22:52.640 --> 22:55.274
According to the console logs,
almost 25 years.

22:55.343 --> 22:57.743
Who else had access
to the original virus back then

22:57.812 --> 22:59.144
aside from you?

22:59.213 --> 23:02.181
Just my computer teacher,
but...

23:05.019 --> 23:06.952
<i>Are you sure it's a good idea</i>

23:07.021 --> 23:08.332
to have McGee
run this interrogation?

23:08.356 --> 23:10.856
I think it is the best idea
I have ever had.

23:10.925 --> 23:13.025
Really?

23:17.398 --> 23:18.664
So you remember me now?

23:18.733 --> 23:20.632
Agent something or other.

23:20.701 --> 23:22.501
And a former student,
or so you tell me.

23:22.570 --> 23:23.769
Hmm.

23:29.043 --> 23:30.376
You remember this?

23:32.146 --> 23:33.679
No.

23:33.748 --> 23:35.714
It's a computer I built
back in high school.

23:35.783 --> 23:38.884
I coded a virus on it
in your class.

23:38.953 --> 23:41.553
Which you stole and
used to infect the DoD.

23:41.622 --> 23:43.822
Really?

23:43.891 --> 23:45.224
And why would I do that?

23:45.292 --> 23:46.825
Well, it's funny
you should ask that.

23:46.894 --> 23:50.629
I'm sure you remember
Petty Officer Griffin.

23:50.698 --> 23:52.331
You should. She filed
a restraining order

23:52.400 --> 23:55.634
against you for
stalking back in 1994.

23:57.104 --> 23:59.405
Oh, I got something else, too.

23:59.473 --> 24:01.507
These logs show that the virus

24:01.575 --> 24:03.308
has been running since...

24:04.412 --> 24:05.577
1994.

24:05.646 --> 24:06.745
Funny, that.

24:06.814 --> 24:08.213
So what did you do?

24:08.282 --> 24:10.048
Well, I'm guessing
that you stole a copy

24:10.117 --> 24:11.984
of the virus from my computer,

24:12.052 --> 24:14.553
then you used it
to attack your ex at work.

24:14.622 --> 24:15.721
This is insane.

24:15.790 --> 24:17.823
And as usual,

24:17.892 --> 24:20.559
you didn't properly format
your headers.

24:20.628 --> 24:22.661
Hmm. So you do remember me.

24:22.730 --> 24:24.096
You're right.

24:24.165 --> 24:25.764
Fantastic idea.

24:27.301 --> 24:28.834
Now I am wondering

24:28.903 --> 24:30.869
why you pretended
to not know me.

24:32.907 --> 24:34.273
Your front desk
says you did,

24:34.341 --> 24:35.841
in fact, speak
with that man

24:35.910 --> 24:38.043
who, as you can
see, is now dead.

24:39.947 --> 24:42.181
Are you gonna stop lying
or do you want me to arrest you

24:42.249 --> 24:43.529
for conspiracy to commit murder?

24:43.584 --> 24:46.185
You got this all wrong.
Enlighten me.

24:48.088 --> 24:49.855
Yes, he called me.

24:49.924 --> 24:52.257
Yes, I spoke with him.

24:52.326 --> 24:53.725
Okay, so why the lying?

24:53.794 --> 24:54.893
Because you're a cop.

24:54.962 --> 24:56.395
Okay, I'm gonna arrest you now.

24:56.464 --> 24:58.697
I run an illegal online
gambling website

24:58.766 --> 25:00.365
for Navy servicemen
overseas.

25:01.602 --> 25:02.935
Started a year ago.

25:03.003 --> 25:04.903
That's why I thought
you were poking around.

25:04.972 --> 25:06.972
And that's what Kane wanted
to talk to you about?

25:07.041 --> 25:08.574
No, he wanted to know

25:08.642 --> 25:10.542
if I still had
the old IP assignments

25:10.611 --> 25:12.978
from a computer class
back in '94.

25:13.047 --> 25:14.780
Old IP assignments?

25:14.849 --> 25:17.249
- Why on earth would he want those?
- He only wanted one.

25:17.318 --> 25:18.717
Um...
Here.

25:18.786 --> 25:20.552
He said he was
looking for someone.

25:20.621 --> 25:22.154
And he wanted to know

25:22.223 --> 25:25.224
who sat in a particular
computer station.

25:25.292 --> 25:26.725
There.

25:38.305 --> 25:40.639
You didn't properly
format your header.

25:40.708 --> 25:42.407
Again.

25:47.515 --> 25:48.981
Oh, my God.

25:49.049 --> 25:52.351
Stop the presses,
Tim McGee got a B-minus?

25:52.419 --> 25:54.152
In computer class?

25:56.223 --> 25:58.190
Too soon?

25:59.994 --> 26:03.128
Your dad's a jackass,
you can't let him win.

26:04.231 --> 26:05.864
He did win.

26:05.933 --> 26:07.165
It's over.

26:07.234 --> 26:08.367
What's over?

26:16.911 --> 26:18.844
The Naval Academy?

26:18.913 --> 26:20.212
Tim, no.

26:20.281 --> 26:21.880
The interview's
already set up.

26:21.949 --> 26:24.216
What happened
to telling him how you feel?

26:24.285 --> 26:25.951
Have you met my dad?

26:26.020 --> 26:27.519
So that's it, then?

26:27.588 --> 26:30.055
You're just gonna give up
on your dreams?

26:30.124 --> 26:32.624
The writing, the dancing?

26:32.693 --> 26:33.792
Yup.

26:35.863 --> 26:38.063
So...

26:38.132 --> 26:40.165
What happens to us, then?

27:03.324 --> 27:05.324
I know who Kane was looking for.

27:05.392 --> 27:06.592
Her name is Chloe.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.471
She was an old friend
of mine from high school.

27:08.495 --> 27:11.730
This IP address right here?

27:11.799 --> 27:13.899
Was assigned to her station
in our computer lab.

27:13.968 --> 27:15.834
Are you sure?
100%.

27:15.903 --> 27:17.736
McGee, how could you
possibly remember that?

27:19.807 --> 27:23.909
♪ I can't give ♪

27:23.978 --> 27:27.846
♪ I can't give any more ♪

27:27.915 --> 27:31.783
♪ I can't live ♪

27:31.852 --> 27:34.920
♪ If living is without you. ♪

27:34.989 --> 27:36.755
I'd rather not say.

27:36.824 --> 27:39.124
Ah, and yet,
that says everything.

27:39.193 --> 27:40.892
So why is our dead guy

27:40.961 --> 27:42.305
looking for
your high school squeeze?

27:42.329 --> 27:44.696
Boss, I never said...
Stop the presses!

27:44.765 --> 27:46.531
Whew.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.368
What do you got?
I tracked down the subsystem

27:49.436 --> 27:51.536
at the DoD
where the virus is running.

27:51.605 --> 27:53.472
Boom! Kasie Hines, representing.

27:53.540 --> 27:54.706
So, what's it doing?

27:54.775 --> 27:56.708
Uh, I'm not sure yet.

27:56.777 --> 27:59.478
But it's been doing it
for 25 years.

27:59.546 --> 28:01.106
That's how long
it's been in the system.

28:01.148 --> 28:03.081
It could be anything.
Anything bad

28:03.150 --> 28:05.484
since we're talking about
cyberterrorism.

28:05.552 --> 28:07.052
Ooh, but the good news is,

28:07.121 --> 28:08.420
I backtraced the virus

28:08.455 --> 28:10.489
to the original IP address
it came from.

28:10.557 --> 28:11.790
Who?

28:11.859 --> 28:12.936
Whoever the man
behind the curtain is

28:12.960 --> 28:16.294
at 192, dot, 168,

28:16.363 --> 28:17.896
dot...
Eight, dot, eight.

28:17.965 --> 28:19.164
Yes.

28:19.233 --> 28:20.399
How did you know that?

28:20.467 --> 28:23.935
Because that's his
old girlfriend's IP address.

28:25.406 --> 28:27.506
Well, your old girlfriend's
a terrorist.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.248
So this bean counter discovers

28:38.283 --> 28:40.350
McGee's old virus
was all up in DoD's grill.

28:40.374 --> 28:41.185
Yup.

28:41.186 --> 28:43.686
- Traces it back to McGee's high school.
- Yup.

28:43.755 --> 28:46.389
Then finds out this Chloe girl
is the one who released it.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.024
- Yup.
- Two days later,

28:48.093 --> 28:49.759
this bean counter is dead.
- Yup.

28:49.828 --> 28:52.695
It ain't looking good for
McGee's girlfriend right now.

28:52.764 --> 28:54.075
- No.
- She wasn't my girlfriend.

28:54.099 --> 28:56.399
Neighbors say
she hasn't been home in a week.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.534
Wasn't at work, either.
Where is she?

28:58.603 --> 28:59.636
Boss, how would I know?

28:59.704 --> 29:01.204
Well, she is the first girl

29:01.273 --> 29:02.605
you ever kissed.
Hmm.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.073
I never said that.
Who said that?

29:04.142 --> 29:06.209
Sloane.
Sloane?

29:06.278 --> 29:07.855
- How on earth would Sloane know?
- All right, geez.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.780
- McGee.
- Boss, I have no idea where Chloe is.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.148
My father was transferred

29:12.217 --> 29:13.583
to Indiana,
we moved there,

29:13.652 --> 29:14.817
I haven't seen her since.

29:14.886 --> 29:16.319
Well, she's clearly on the run.

29:16.388 --> 29:17.632
That's probably
a good idea since

29:17.656 --> 29:19.589
she attacked
the Department of Defense.

29:19.658 --> 29:20.868
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Hold on.

29:20.892 --> 29:23.012
Now, I know what it looks like,
but I'm not buying it.

29:23.061 --> 29:24.594
Look, I know how you feel.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.329
Okay, I once had a girlfriend

29:26.398 --> 29:28.131
who turned out to be...
a cat burglar.

29:28.199 --> 29:30.066
She wasn't my girlfriend.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.301
Okay?

29:31.369 --> 29:33.303
And she never attacked
the military, okay?

29:33.371 --> 29:35.772
At least, not back in 1994.

29:37.809 --> 29:40.943
- How do I look?
- Like you're about to walk the plank.

29:41.012 --> 29:43.479
That's about how I feel.

29:43.548 --> 29:45.448
You shouldn't
be doing this, Tim.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.651
It's just an interview.
For the Naval Academy.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.322
You should be
applying to Juilliard.

29:52.390 --> 29:53.823
Don't get me wrong,

29:53.892 --> 29:55.625
my entire family's
in the Navy.

29:55.694 --> 29:58.261
But it's not what you should
be doing with your life.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.096
You don't think I know that?

30:01.599 --> 30:03.766
I don't want to have
anything to do with the Navy.

30:03.835 --> 30:06.469
- So what are you doing, then?
- His damn duty.

30:11.876 --> 30:13.309
Goodbye, Chloe.

30:17.415 --> 30:20.149
I'll hit you up
on the bat channel later.

30:21.853 --> 30:23.686
Hold on a second.

30:23.755 --> 30:25.955
I think I know
how to find Chloe.

30:27.292 --> 30:28.791
The bat channel.

30:31.696 --> 30:33.863
Kasie, that weird
data corruption

30:33.932 --> 30:35.631
in the IRC chat
from my apartment?

30:35.700 --> 30:37.734
Pull it up.
Uh, what's happening?

30:37.802 --> 30:40.303
McGee unchained.
Just go with it.

30:42.907 --> 30:44.540
That is not
data corruption.

30:44.609 --> 30:47.377
- What is that?
- It's a secret code that Chloe and I came up with

30:47.445 --> 30:49.345
to speak privately
in group chats.

30:49.414 --> 30:51.981
A is B, B is C, C is...
Yeah, I got it.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.583
Give me a sec to rig up
a translator.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.887
Hey, McGee, it's, uh,
it's amazing, man.

30:58.957 --> 31:00.189
It's amazing that
you were able

31:00.258 --> 31:02.258
to find a woman
to procreate with.

31:02.327 --> 31:04.093
Done.
What does it say?

31:04.162 --> 31:06.829
Looks like... "SOS."

31:06.898 --> 31:08.698
She's in trouble.
What are those numbers?

31:10.435 --> 31:11.701
Longitude and latitude.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.581
She's not the bad guy.
Whatever's going on here,

31:13.605 --> 31:14.704
she's asking for help.

31:14.773 --> 31:15.705
Or it's a trap.

31:15.774 --> 31:17.440
McGee, come on.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.575
With me. Let's go.

31:39.764 --> 31:41.697
There it is.

31:41.766 --> 31:43.366
RV?

31:43.435 --> 31:44.945
Boss, you know this is
less than two miles

31:44.969 --> 31:46.702
from where they
found Kane's body.

31:48.273 --> 31:50.139
After you.

32:00.318 --> 32:02.084
Tim.

32:02.153 --> 32:03.920
Chloe. Oh, my God,
are you okay?

32:03.988 --> 32:05.154
You got my message.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.990
Yeah, on the bat channel
hidden on the IRC stream.

32:08.059 --> 32:09.292
They made me do it, Tim.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.127
They made me lure you
out of your apartment.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.396
It's okay.
You're safe now. You're okay.

32:13.465 --> 32:14.931
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

32:14.999 --> 32:15.999
Clear.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.834
Told you, boss.

32:17.902 --> 32:18.536
Told him what?

32:18.560 --> 32:20.237
We thought you had
unleashed a virus

32:20.238 --> 32:21.771
on the Department of Defense.

32:24.676 --> 32:25.908
Oh...

32:25.977 --> 32:28.077
What?
Well...

32:29.547 --> 32:31.414
About that...

32:37.355 --> 32:40.690
This is the virus
we found running at DoD.

32:40.758 --> 32:42.859
This may have been me.

32:42.927 --> 32:48.698
And by "may have,"
I mean this was me.

32:48.766 --> 32:50.666
What were you thinking?

32:50.735 --> 32:52.468
I wasn't. I was 16.

32:52.537 --> 32:53.870
You stole my virus,

32:53.938 --> 32:55.972
and then you used it
to attack the military.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.940
No, I copied it.

32:58.009 --> 32:59.542
And I didn't attack anyone.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.310
The day you crashed
your Z28,

33:01.379 --> 33:03.513
you asked me to bring home
your computer from school.

33:03.581 --> 33:05.348
Well, I saw the code
that you wrote,

33:05.416 --> 33:09.051
and realized with a few tweaks,

33:09.120 --> 33:13.456
the virus could be
a bit more, um... effective.

33:13.525 --> 33:14.891
At what?
I modified it

33:14.959 --> 33:16.537
to take rounding errors
from payroll checks

33:16.561 --> 33:18.694
and deposit them
into a holding account.

33:18.763 --> 33:19.695
Of course you did.

33:19.764 --> 33:22.164
Tim, I ran the virus
as a goof.

33:22.233 --> 33:23.393
I didn't even think
it worked,

33:23.434 --> 33:25.034
and I had completely
forgot about it.

33:25.103 --> 33:26.903
Right. Until?
Last week,

33:26.971 --> 33:29.305
out of nowhere,
this guy grabs me

33:29.374 --> 33:31.534
and says he wants to know
where the holding account is.

33:31.576 --> 33:34.544
Well, yeah, your virus
has been running for 25 years.

33:34.612 --> 33:36.590
There's probably millions
of dollars in that account.

33:36.614 --> 33:38.514
So I heard.

33:39.784 --> 33:42.251
But I told him I had no idea.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.200
He'd have to track down
the original source code

33:44.255 --> 33:45.922
to find the money.

33:45.990 --> 33:48.925
Which was on my old computer.

33:48.993 --> 33:50.593
This the guy who grabbed you?

33:50.662 --> 33:57.233
No, the guy that grabbed me
had these... beady little eyes.

33:57.302 --> 33:59.402
Well, you're gonna need
to do better than that.

33:59.470 --> 34:03.739
And, like, a big,
bushy moustache.

34:05.476 --> 34:07.109
Moustache?

34:07.178 --> 34:09.344
Smarmy.

34:09.414 --> 34:10.947
I'm gonna
enjoy this takedown.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.214
In the sun.

34:12.283 --> 34:15.418
Gotta love that vitamin D.

34:15.485 --> 34:17.553
Do you have any idea
how often you flex?

34:17.621 --> 34:19.455
Girls don't really
find that attractive.

34:19.524 --> 34:20.956
How would you know?

34:21.025 --> 34:22.803
You didn't even kiss a girl
until you were 16.

34:22.827 --> 34:25.226
Where are you getting
this stuff from, huh?

34:26.431 --> 34:28.230
Yo, heads up.

34:28.299 --> 34:30.032
Right on schedule.

34:41.145 --> 34:43.045
This is a first.

34:43.114 --> 34:45.214
Are you that looking forward
to giving me your final

34:45.283 --> 34:47.161
expense reports that you
brought them out to me?

34:47.185 --> 34:50.119
Oh, we brought something
out for you all right.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.161
That's a good one.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.329
That was a good tackle.

35:05.970 --> 35:08.304
So, this Kane guy somehow

35:08.373 --> 35:11.007
found out about my virus,
tracked it back to me,

35:11.075 --> 35:13.576
and then reported it to his boss?
- Yep.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.678
When the boss found out
how much money was missing,

35:15.747 --> 35:18.080
he killed Kane and went
after the cash himself.

35:18.149 --> 35:20.816
But the virus has been
running for 25 years.

35:20.885 --> 35:22.518
Why now?
What happened?

35:22.587 --> 35:23.953
I happened.

35:24.022 --> 35:25.988
Your virus has been trying
to ping my computer...

35:26.057 --> 35:28.791
This way?
...for years.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.127
Last week,
when they turned it on,

35:31.195 --> 35:32.361
it finally succeeded.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.296
Set off a DoD internal alarm.

35:34.365 --> 35:38.701
Huh. So that's when Kane

35:38.770 --> 35:40.536
noticed the missing money.

35:40.605 --> 35:43.305
Yup.
So, what's all this?

35:43.374 --> 35:44.640
Gibbs had me bag and tag

35:44.709 --> 35:46.042
anything I kept
from high school.

35:51.849 --> 35:53.282
Look at how young he was.

35:53.351 --> 35:54.884
Yeah.

36:00.224 --> 36:04.226
So it's kind of like you
joined the Navy after all.

36:06.097 --> 36:07.730
My dad didn't quite
see it that way,

36:07.799 --> 36:11.901
but, uh, yeah,
I guess I sort of did.

36:11.969 --> 36:13.736
He made peace with it.

36:17.208 --> 36:18.674
What about you?

36:21.212 --> 36:23.179
I am exactly where
I want to be.

36:23.247 --> 36:24.647
And as it turns out,

36:24.716 --> 36:26.849
the Navy made me
the man I am.

36:26.918 --> 36:30.820
So, the apple didn't
fall far from the tree

36:30.888 --> 36:33.089
after all.

36:36.594 --> 36:38.327
In more ways than one.

36:41.165 --> 36:43.110
Well, right now,
this apple needs to get home

36:43.134 --> 36:44.600
and watch the twins.

36:44.669 --> 36:46.102
Babysitter needs to leave.

36:48.339 --> 36:49.772
Who's that?

36:49.841 --> 36:51.841
Um...

36:51.909 --> 36:53.709
This is...

36:53.778 --> 36:55.222
I'm just kidding.
We met in the lobby.

36:55.246 --> 36:56.178
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:56.247 --> 36:57.613
You really married up, Tim.

36:57.682 --> 36:59.882
- Oh, thank you. You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.851
Wait, uh, what?

37:01.919 --> 37:03.052
Oh, we're going to dinner.

37:03.121 --> 37:05.187
I thought you said
I had to watch the twins.

37:05.256 --> 37:07.857
Oh, no, you're not coming.

37:09.827 --> 37:12.561
Um, I don't think this is
such a good idea.

37:12.630 --> 37:13.974
Honey, how often do I get
to hang out

37:13.998 --> 37:15.831
with my husband's old
high school buddies?

37:17.001 --> 37:18.901
We were kind of more
than just buddies.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.870
Oh, I can't wait to hear
all about that.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.151
Just tell me one thing.

37:35.219 --> 37:37.219
What's so wrong with the Navy?

37:38.990 --> 37:40.923
It made me the man I am.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.658
I know that.

37:56.374 --> 37:58.073
And it could do so much for you.

37:59.310 --> 38:00.442
I know that, too.

38:07.552 --> 38:10.119
But it's not my life,
it's yours.

38:13.658 --> 38:16.192
I can't make
this decision for you.

38:25.002 --> 38:29.872
I made a lot of mistakes
in my life when it came to you.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.307
Not this time.

38:33.711 --> 38:37.613
So, in the end, uh...

38:37.682 --> 38:39.381
the choice is yours to make.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.992
But I think you've
already made it, haven't you?

38:53.431 --> 38:55.164
Actually, I don't know.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.466
I don't know what
I should do.

38:57.535 --> 39:00.636
I'm sure you can't
relate to that.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.010
You'd be surprised.

39:20.324 --> 39:23.092
We all have our dreams.
