sci-fi posters,

08:06.977 --> 08:09.744
robots, uh
- since '80, '81.

08:09.846 --> 08:11.880
He also, uh, makes his own robots.

08:11.982 --> 08:13.081
- Yeah.
- Really?

08:13.183 --> 08:15.116
Out of old folding cell phones.

08:15.218 --> 08:16.918
You know, the-the
old- - Wanna see some?

08:17.020 --> 08:18.386
- I would love to see some.
- The old Nokias.

08:18.488 --> 08:19.788
He's like, "Do I wanna
see one? I own one. "

08:19.890 --> 08:21.523
[laughter]

08:21.625 --> 08:23.925
- Oh, wow.
- That's what these are.

08:24.027 --> 08:25.026
Number two.

08:25.128 --> 08:26.728
It just was an idea,

08:26.830 --> 08:28.763
because all-all these things
are just laying around.

08:28.865 --> 08:31.132
And so I figured I would just make them.

08:31.234 --> 08:32.767
Like a hobby, you know.

08:32.869 --> 08:34.436
I mean, you know-
I mean, I kinda see-

08:34.538 --> 08:36.705
I mean, were thinking Tobor...
You see it, right?

08:36.807 --> 08:38.940
- <i>... on the-on this one?</i>
<i>- K-kind of, kind of. </i>

08:39.042 --> 08:40.308
What is that, '54, right?

08:40.409 --> 08:41.977
- Yeah.
- "Tobor" is '54.

08:42.078 --> 08:43.979
You're-you're really-
you know your stuff, huh?

08:44.081 --> 08:47.048
What'd it feel like, man, to
see punk royalty in the store?

08:47.150 --> 08:48.583
- I got
- I gotta be honest with you, man.

08:48.685 --> 08:50.585
I remember being a little bit leary

08:50.687 --> 08:52.253
of punk because, uh-

08:52.356 --> 08:53.421
'Cause you were a s
you were a small boy.

08:53.523 --> 08:54.923
- Yeah.
- And you're like,

08:55.025 --> 08:56.124
"They look frightening, Ma. "
- Definitely.

08:56.226 --> 08:58.059
Yeah, I saw the guys with the mohawks,

08:58.161 --> 08:59.995
the studs and everything.

09:00.097 --> 09:02.497
It turns out though I was wrong
to be afraid of punk though,

09:02.599 --> 09:05.333
because Marky's into the
same thing that we're into.

09:05.435 --> 09:08.603
He was a-a geek like us, a nerd.

09:08.705 --> 09:10.105
- You found common ground.
- Yep.

09:10.207 --> 09:12.407
[laughter]
- Really? Oh, my lord.

09:12.509 --> 09:14.242
- Started going to sci
- fi stores

09:14.344 --> 09:17.412
in the early '80s, going to the cities,

09:17.514 --> 09:19.014
and then looking at the Yellow Pages

09:19.116 --> 09:21.116
and looking for all the collectable place,

09:21.218 --> 09:22.784
and just rummaging through everything

09:22.886 --> 09:25.253
and taking everything for, like, $10

09:25.355 --> 09:28.690
for a poster that's worth,
uh, $3,000, $4,000 now.

09:28.792 --> 09:30.125
They didn't know back then.

09:30.227 --> 09:31.593
So let me get this straight,

09:31.695 --> 09:32.861
when you were on tour with the Ramones...

09:32.963 --> 09:34.696
- Right.
- You'd go into a city,

09:34.798 --> 09:36.698
and the first thing you'd
do is go into the phone book

09:36.800 --> 09:38.767
- and look for collectable stores?
- Yeah.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.435
I gotta be honest, I thought, like,

09:40.537 --> 09:42.437
in the '70s or the '80s,
when-like, at the height

09:42.539 --> 09:43.972
of-of punk rock,

09:44.074 --> 09:46.307
that's the level of
decadence that was going on?

09:46.410 --> 09:48.376
[laughter]
- That's it, that's it.

09:48.478 --> 09:49.544
No groupies.

09:49.646 --> 09:51.146
Just sci-fi and robots.

09:51.248 --> 09:53.381
- Really? -
I have, uh-

09:53.483 --> 09:55.116
- I might as well be a rock star.
- Yeah. [chuckling]

09:55.218 --> 09:57.485
- Walt is, like, one of the
most punk rock people I know

09:57.587 --> 10:00.388
when it comes to comic books,
because he was the first one

10:00.490 --> 10:01.890
standing up for, like,

10:01.992 --> 10:03.625
"I don't care what people say about this.

10:03.727 --> 10:06.127
"If people laughed at me
for reading 'The Watchmen,'

10:06.229 --> 10:07.796
"I read 'The Watchmen," they didn't.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.798
Who's stupid? 'The
Watchmen' is excellent. "

10:09.900 --> 10:12.801
But he was out there
standing up for his tribe,

10:12.903 --> 10:15.203
which was comic books, the
same way that the Ramones

10:15.305 --> 10:17.639
would stand up for their
tribe, which was music.

10:17.741 --> 10:20.175
He paved the road to
punk. You bought comics.

10:20.277 --> 10:22.510
[laughter]

10:22.612 --> 10:23.912
So all all you guys were into that?

10:24.014 --> 10:25.647
- Me and Johnny Ramone.
- Oh, really?

10:25.749 --> 10:27.749
<i> Yeah, we were-</i>
<i>we were the sci-fi, uh,</i>

10:27.851 --> 10:29.384
<i>poster, robot,</i>
<i>collectable guys. </i>

10:29.486 --> 10:31.086
- Plus you went to Japan
and all overseas, right?

10:31.188 --> 10:33.054
- Yeah, Japan, Toy Tokyo's
there and everything.

10:33.156 --> 10:34.989
- Oh, wow, wow.
- You know, bring back

10:35.092 --> 10:37.158
all the plastic Rodans, Godzillas,

10:37.260 --> 10:39.360
<i>Ghidorah,</i>
<i>Three-Headed Monster's. </i>

10:39.463 --> 10:41.362
- He brought some of his,
uh, own collection, too,

10:41.465 --> 10:42.931
since we're sort of packing out.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.332
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You wanna see some things?

10:44.434 --> 10:45.734
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

10:45.836 --> 10:47.368
- This is-this is,
uh, ideal. - Oh, wow.

10:47.471 --> 10:49.738
Like, see
see the inspiration comes from the old stuff.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.273
- This is from, um...
- Ideal.

10:52.375 --> 10:54.175
Ideal. This is from the '50s.

10:54.277 --> 10:56.444
And this-this- I have
about five of these.

10:56.546 --> 10:58.079
You know who that is, right?

10:58.181 --> 10:59.447
Yeah, it's Robby. Robby the Robot.

10:59.549 --> 11:00.882
Very good.

11:00.984 --> 11:02.183
Could I ask you a
question about your robots?

11:02.285 --> 11:04.085
- Yeah.
- Is this really a statement

11:04.187 --> 11:06.855
on society, like rock and roll rebel?

11:06.957 --> 11:10.058
This represents the government,
the eyes always watching us,

11:10.160 --> 11:11.926
and enough about a bunch
of robots, unfeeling?

11:12.028 --> 11:14.629
- I think
- I think what it really is obsolescent.

11:14.731 --> 11:16.965
It's obsolete. It's a moment in time.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.067
Then this is the reflection of it.

11:19.169 --> 11:21.536
You know, then phones changed an-

11:21.638 --> 11:23.538
So you don't want to join
my antigovernment militia,

11:23.640 --> 11:24.606
is what you're saying?

11:24.708 --> 11:25.874
No, no, no. [laughter]

11:25.976 --> 11:26.941
- Okay, fine.
- No, no, no, no.

11:27.043 --> 11:28.910
He likes monsters

11:29.012 --> 11:30.645
and '50s robots?
- Robots.

11:30.747 --> 11:32.247
Did you ask him for a blood test

11:32.349 --> 11:33.782
to make sure you weren't
related in some way?

11:33.884 --> 11:35.383
[laughter]
- Maybe I'm a Ramone!

11:35.485 --> 11:37.051
Yes, oh, my lord, we'd keep it going!

11:37.154 --> 11:38.620
- Walter Ramone.
- Walter Ramone.

11:38.722 --> 11:41.156
Ladies and gentlemen, give
it up for the lost Ramone,

11:41.258 --> 11:42.924
Walter Ramone!

11:43.026 --> 11:46.895
[laughter]

11:46.997 --> 11:48.630
All right, well, thanks
thanks for having me here.

11:48.732 --> 11:50.965
It was a lot of fun. Into
the same stuff I'm into.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.467
Thank you for coming in.

11:52.569 --> 11:54.402
It's great to see a store like this.

11:54.504 --> 11:55.670
- Thank you.
- Really cool.

11:55.772 --> 11:57.338
Please come back any time.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.174
Here's an old cliché, keep rocking.

11:59.276 --> 12:00.809

- Ohh, man.

12:06.516 --> 12:08.516
I haven't seen these in, what, 30 years?

12:10.463 --> 12:12.364
Favorite Ramone song?

12:12.466 --> 12:14.366
I'm gonna go for "Blitzkrieg Bop. "

12:14.468 --> 12:15.868
I love that song.

12:15.970 --> 12:17.569
What about you, Ming,
favorite Ramones song?

12:17.671 --> 12:19.271
I like "Blitzkrieg Bop" as well,

12:19.373 --> 12:21.040
except I did-I never knew the name of it.

12:21.142 --> 12:22.474
I thought it was just the
"Hey, ho, let's go" song.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.777
It counts. both: Hey, ho, let's go.

12:24.879 --> 12:26.912
- [chuckles]
- Very easily singable song.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.947
Mike, you got a Ramones song that you like?

12:29.050 --> 12:30.582
"Wanna be Sedated. "

12:30.684 --> 12:32.584
- Oh, of course, classic.
- "Wanna be Sedated. "

12:32.686 --> 12:34.887
So you wanna be more
sedated than you are now?

12:34.989 --> 12:36.255
[laughter]

12:36.357 --> 12:38.157
I think I'm perfectly sedated.

12:38.259 --> 12:40.325
I tried to open
"Mallrats" with that song,

12:40.428 --> 12:41.994
but we couldn't get the rights.

12:42.096 --> 12:43.395
That was actually the very first song

12:43.497 --> 12:44.830
that Marky Mark ever played on.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.665
Really? You call him Marky Mark now?

12:46.767 --> 12:47.900
You're that familiar with him?

12:48.002 --> 12:49.635

I don't know if Marky
Ramone would like that.

him, he takes the snake,

14:04.648 --> 14:06.581
and he rips the jaws apart.

14:06.683 --> 14:08.516
Not a metaphor at all.

14:08.618 --> 14:10.018
For what?

14:10.120 --> 14:12.053
It's a big snake, it's phallic.

Not "King Dong," right?

I'm telling you,

14:31.975 --> 14:33.374
I was so excited for Kong,

14:33.476 --> 14:35.043
I... I remember opening night,

14:35.145 --> 14:36.811
my family, uh, we were
gonna go out to dinner,

14:36.913 --> 14:38.746
and we were going to see "King Kong,"

14:38.848 --> 14:40.982
and I had to wait in school
with the anticipation.

14:41.084 --> 14:42.417
Was killing me.

14:59.102 --> 15:00.802

15:00.904 --> 15:03.671
He was promising that "Kong"
would be bigger than "Jaws,"

15:03.773 --> 15:08.810
because he said, "Nobody
cries when Jaws dies. "

15:08.912 --> 15:10.078

15:30.567 --> 15:32.133
and gave them to me back then.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.102
So I've had them ever since.

15:34.204 --> 15:36.504
I remember when the '33
one came on TV one day.

15:36.606 --> 15:37.939
My dad was like, "You're gonna sit down

15:38.041 --> 15:39.307
and you're gonna watch this. "

15:39.409 --> 15:40.775
And I watched it, and I fell asleep.

15:40.877 --> 15:41.976
- Really?
- Yeah, and he got-

15:42.078 --> 15:43.344
He was so mad at me.

15:43.446 --> 15:45.012
That's a moment where fathers and sons

15:45.115 --> 15:46.848
bond over King Kong, man.

15:46.950 --> 15:48.316
That's where you
- that's where it happens.

15:48.418 --> 15:49.350
King Kong?

15:49.452 --> 15:50.718
You should go call him up

15:50.820 --> 15:52.453
and make a date this weekend to watch Kong.

15:52.555 --> 15:54.489
And you don't leave that room
until you guys are hugging

15:54.591 --> 15:57.191
and crying and telling each
other you love each other.

15:57.293 --> 15:58.793
So in other words, they've gone insane.

15:58.895 --> 16:00.828
[laughter]

16:00.930 --> 16:02.897
So why are you selling them then?

16:02.999 --> 16:04.632
It's kind of collecting dust.
Kinda ready to get rid of 'em.

16:04.734 --> 16:06.534
These should not be collecting dust.

16:06.636 --> 16:07.969
- No.
- These should be on a shelf,

16:08.071 --> 16:09.804
polished every day.

16:09.906 --> 16:11.639
By me. [chuckling]

16:11.741 --> 16:13.708
- Yeah.
- I personally want these.

16:13.810 --> 16:15.176
They're in great shape.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.544
They look like they haven't even been used.

16:16.646 --> 16:17.979
I don't think they ever have been.

16:18.081 --> 16:19.313

16:19.416 --> 16:21.315
You know I want 'em. You got me by-

too phallic for you guys.

Let's-let's- let's

16:28.425 --> 16:30.491
How 'bout $25?

16:30.593 --> 16:33.561
- For a huge fan.
- Which I am.

16:33.663 --> 16:35.096

- $25?

16:35.198 --> 16:37.064

Makes a lot more sense,
'cause the disco Dazzler.

18:11.650 --> 18:14.017
- Wow.
- She was Alison Blaire.

18:14.119 --> 18:15.652
She had roller skates, and her powers were

18:15.754 --> 18:17.520
she could take sound
and turn it into light.

18:17.622 --> 18:19.322
- Yep, yep.

18:19.424 --> 18:21.124

When disco was popular,
I was seven, eight years old

18:27.966 --> 18:30.133
or something, so I
certainly wasn't there going,

18:30.235 --> 18:33.036
"Hey, ladies," but you
couldn't avoid the music.

18:33.138 --> 18:34.337
- [snickers]
- It was everywhere.

18:34.439 --> 18:35.638
I mean, I definitely, um,

18:35.740 --> 18:36.706
was a closet disco fan.

18:36.808 --> 18:38.307
I was a huge disco fan,

18:38.410 --> 18:39.575
but I didn't let anybody
know about it, though.

18:39.678 --> 18:41.144

uh, 45s of all the big hits.

were a closeted disco fan.

18:46.851 --> 18:48.151

18:49.454 --> 18:50.653
Oh, come on, man.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.188
Back when we were growing up,

18:52.290 --> 18:53.656
kids were talking around
with their Stones patches,

18:53.758 --> 18:54.857
Led Zeppelin, and, you know,

18:54.959 --> 18:56.225
if I roll up with my Peaches & Herb-

18:56.327 --> 18:58.661
[laughter]

18:58.763 --> 19:01.097
Now Marvel was never ashamed
to jump on a bandwagon

19:01.199 --> 19:02.532
or a trend, right?

19:02.634 --> 19:04.667
Shaft...
- Yes, the blaxploitation stuff.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.235
Kind of-with Luke Cage.

19:06.337 --> 19:08.738
- Yep, Kung fu. Shang
- Chi became an Avenger.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.841
Remember they tried to
turn the NFL into a superhero

19:11.943 --> 19:13.843
- with "NFL SuperPro. "
- "SuperPro. "

19:13.945 --> 19:14.911
Oh, my God, and "Kickers, Inc. "

19:15.013 --> 19:16.379
- [laughs]
- Oh, dear lord.

19:16.481 --> 19:18.715
- "NFL SuperPro" was the
most ridiculous concept.

19:18.817 --> 19:20.216
He was a quarterback.

19:20.318 --> 19:22.285
He's too washed-up to
play in the NFL anymore,

19:22.387 --> 19:24.120
and he's given superpowers.

19:24.222 --> 19:27.090
And he goes and fights people
who want to, uh, maybe, like,

19:27.192 --> 19:28.691
sabotage the Super Bowl.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.026

19:39.137 --> 19:40.636
In the case of Dazzler,

19:40.739 --> 19:42.605
disco was just about to
end when they were like,

19:42.707 --> 19:45.274
"Hey, here's our disco
character, Spider Friends. "

19:45.376 --> 19:47.944
Marvel, while you
would think on the surface

19:48.046 --> 19:49.912
it'd be, like, a
one-dimensional character,

19:50.014 --> 19:51.748
they really put her into, uh,

19:51.850 --> 19:53.750
a different category of
- of powers.

19:53.852 --> 19:55.485
Like, you would think that
it wouldn't be very powerful,

19:55.587 --> 19:57.653
a light-based hero, but
she even took on Galactus

19:57.756 --> 19:59.322
in her own series early on.

19:59.424 --> 20:00.823
- And?
- We're still here, right?

20:00.925 --> 20:02.291
I mean, Galactus didn't eat the Earth.

20:02.393 --> 20:05.661

20:16.007 --> 20:19.842
