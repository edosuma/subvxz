WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.625
(laughter, shouting,
whooping)

00:02.709 --> 00:04.291
GERALD: All right,
game time. Let's do this.

00:04.375 --> 00:05.375
Yeah! Our favorite
country singer.

00:05.458 --> 00:06.417
Uh, Willie Nelson.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.667
Female.

00:07.750 --> 00:08.750
First name good--
now, make it

00:08.834 --> 00:09.625
the matriarch of<i> Parenthood. </i>

00:09.709 --> 00:11.375
Uh... Bonnie Bedelia!

00:11.458 --> 00:13.083
Good. Now, your favorite book
when you were six!

00:13.166 --> 00:14.500
<i>Amelia Bedelia!</i>

00:14.583 --> 00:16.041
Time! Time!

00:16.125 --> 00:18.375
That was literally like
watching verbal incest.

00:18.458 --> 00:19.750
Oh, don't be jealous.

00:19.834 --> 00:21.375
I assure you I am not.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.291
Well, you know, this is
sort of a blowout.

00:23.375 --> 00:24.417
Do you guys want
to switch up teams?

00:24.500 --> 00:26.333
Vanessa, you want
to roll with me?

00:26.417 --> 00:28.500
I, uh, give as good
as I take.

00:28.583 --> 00:31.375
I mean I take
as good as I give.

00:31.458 --> 00:32.458
I love taking it.

00:33.542 --> 00:34.458
You can team up
with my mom.

00:34.542 --> 00:37.250
Yeah.
All right.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.500
VANESSA: Okay.

00:38.583 --> 00:39.500
I got it.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.166
Uh... oh, I am this old.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.875
23... 22...

00:42.959 --> 00:43.959
32.
No.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.083
Pass. This is too hard.

00:45.166 --> 00:46.083
GERALD: Okay, uh,
the first letter

00:46.166 --> 00:47.458
of my middle name.

00:47.542 --> 00:49.500
My favorite place to go.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.583
Uh, my favorite dessert.

00:50.667 --> 00:52.417
The name of my blog.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.458
I'm allergic to this.

00:54.542 --> 00:56.125
Give me those.
You're no good at giving clues.

00:56.208 --> 00:57.792
All right.
(clears throat)

00:57.875 --> 00:59.375
Uh, okay, the age I was

00:59.458 --> 01:00.417
when I lost my virginity.

01:00.500 --> 01:01.667
Uh, 16.
Nope.

01:01.750 --> 01:02.667
18.
Wrong way.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.083
Pass. Can I pass?

01:04.166 --> 01:05.417
Fine.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.583
It was Friday the 13th.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.792
Thirteen?!

01:07.875 --> 01:09.250
Damn!

01:09.333 --> 01:10.417
(chuckling):
Wow.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.417
Time.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.500
(weak laugh)

01:15.500 --> 01:18.041
Jenga, anyone?

01:21.083 --> 01:22.417
SARA:
Jimmy, hang on.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.458
No, I played your game,
I drank your tap water,

01:24.542 --> 01:25.625
please let me leave
the suburbs!

01:25.709 --> 01:27.208
Oh, cut it out.

01:27.291 --> 01:29.333
Look, I see how hard
you've been trying lately.

01:29.417 --> 01:31.041
You're welcome.
Not done.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.083
Jimmy, I'm rooting for you,

01:33.166 --> 01:35.250
but you're not really
getting to know Gerald.

01:35.333 --> 01:37.208
Sure, you spend the
appropriate amount

01:37.291 --> 01:38.583
of time with him, but...

01:38.667 --> 01:40.250
It's like your hair.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.291
It looks good
but it's not real.

01:42.375 --> 01:43.583
It is, too!

01:43.667 --> 01:45.333
How many times do I have
to let you tug it?

01:45.417 --> 01:46.750
One more time.
No.

01:47.667 --> 01:48.792
No...

01:50.542 --> 01:52.333
Incredible!
That's just incredible!

01:52.417 --> 01:54.208
You're one to talk about
my relationship with Gerald.

01:54.291 --> 01:55.792
I mean, thanks to you,

01:55.875 --> 01:57.875
he's a wig and a motel away
from being Norman Bates.

01:57.959 --> 01:59.458
One more time.

01:59.542 --> 02:01.542
Yeah.
(gasps)

02:01.625 --> 02:02.542
Ah! (laughs)

02:02.625 --> 02:03.667
It's incredible.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.333
Okay, we get
one more story,

02:06.417 --> 02:08.709
and then we have
to go to bed, okay?

02:08.792 --> 02:10.458
Okay, ready?

02:10.542 --> 02:12.500
Once there was a kingdom,

02:12.583 --> 02:15.000
ruled by
a democratically elected,

02:15.083 --> 02:17.500
mixed-race,
female prime minister.

02:17.583 --> 02:20.208
And there was a princess
in a castle.

02:20.291 --> 02:25.500
And one day, the princess
met the perfect guy.

02:25.583 --> 02:26.834
He had long hair,

02:26.917 --> 02:28.458
and he had those lines
on the sides of his abs,

02:28.542 --> 02:29.500
and he did MMA,

02:29.583 --> 02:31.458
but only for the money,

02:31.542 --> 02:32.709
not because he's violent.

02:32.792 --> 02:34.625
Yeah! But then he died.

02:34.709 --> 02:35.834
Violently.

02:35.917 --> 02:36.959
Mm-hmm.

02:37.041 --> 02:38.125
But she met a better guy,

02:38.208 --> 02:39.959
with medium-brown hair,

02:40.041 --> 02:41.458
who loved 3D printing,

02:41.542 --> 02:43.458
and read the entire
Harry Potter series

02:43.542 --> 02:44.500
in one weekend.

02:44.583 --> 02:46.917
And he was super rich.

02:47.041 --> 02:48.625
In untapped potential.

02:48.709 --> 02:49.959
With a sick ride.

02:50.041 --> 02:51.834
That was also good
for the environment,

02:51.917 --> 02:53.542
'cause it was a bicycle.

02:53.625 --> 02:56.291
And they fell in love and
lived happily ever after.

02:56.375 --> 02:57.542
They did?

02:57.625 --> 02:59.250
I saw an ending
and I took it.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.750
And she was kind of
checked out of this one.

03:01.834 --> 03:02.750
Come on, baby, let's go.

03:02.834 --> 03:03.750
We need to go to bed.

03:03.834 --> 03:04.834
We're outta here.

03:04.917 --> 03:06.125
Ooh!

03:08.625 --> 03:09.750
Can you believe Sara?

03:09.834 --> 03:10.750
I mean,
I've known Gerald a month,

03:10.834 --> 03:11.917
and she expects me to know

03:12.000 --> 03:12.917
what size boxers
the kid wears.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.250
Come on, man.

03:14.333 --> 03:15.542
You know that kid
wears briefs.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.333
He so does, doesn't he?

03:17.417 --> 03:18.542
She thinks I have issues
with Gerald.

03:18.625 --> 03:20.250
She's the one with issues.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.166
I mean, with her movie nights
and her game nights

03:22.250 --> 03:23.667
and her weird
"best friend mom" shtick.

03:23.750 --> 03:24.834
Nights.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.542
Maybe you both have issues.

03:26.625 --> 03:27.750
I pay you to chop, Victor.

03:27.834 --> 03:28.750
Just chop.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.125
Sara's right.

03:30.208 --> 03:31.667
You do have a hard time
getting real with people.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.917
I do not!
Okay.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.583
I am unfulfilled professionally,

03:35.667 --> 03:37.000
and I think
it's making me depressed.

03:38.583 --> 03:39.875
Who got that pepper mill?

03:39.959 --> 03:41.583
I hate this pepper mill.
Get a new pepper mill.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.917
You heard the man!
Get a new pepper mill!

03:44.000 --> 03:45.709
No... that's what
Jimmy does.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.667
Every time somebody
tries to get real with you,

03:47.750 --> 03:49.291
you change the subject,

03:49.375 --> 03:50.583
usually by asking for
a new pepper mill.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.000
(grumbling):
Nah.

03:54.417 --> 03:56.000
(grumbling):
Nah.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.875
Calling off the pepper mill
as a distraction technique.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.083
Are you really unhappy here?

04:02.166 --> 04:04.500
I have been working for
you for ten years,

04:04.583 --> 04:05.959
and I have no more
responsibility

04:06.041 --> 04:06.959
than when I started.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.583
I have ideas!

04:08.667 --> 04:10.834
Well, you know, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't know.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.291
I want to do better.
Go ahead, hit me.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.834
What do you got?

04:13.917 --> 04:15.709
For starters, our bar
scene needs an update.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.000
By which I mean Willy.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.333
What's wrong with Willy?

04:19.709 --> 04:21.291
Bonjour, Monsieur Lemon!

04:21.375 --> 04:22.625
Wow, this one's a fighter!

04:22.709 --> 04:23.667
Ooh! Wow!

04:23.750 --> 04:24.709
ANNELISE:
Look at him!

04:24.792 --> 04:26.000
I swear to God,
the other day,

04:26.083 --> 04:27.917
I heard him say,
"ha-cha-cha."

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Hey, Willy, doing any
cocktail specials tonight?

04:30.083 --> 04:31.792
We got some really great
blackberries in.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.208
Blackberries?!

04:33.291 --> 04:34.667
Am I making a drink
or a pie?

04:34.750 --> 04:36.500
(laughing): A pie!
Good one, Willy!

04:36.583 --> 04:38.250
Hey, you want some
seltzer, Jimbo?

04:38.333 --> 04:39.542
Sure!

04:39.625 --> 04:40.542
Oop! Yeah!

04:40.625 --> 04:42.625
This guy.
Yeah.

04:42.709 --> 04:44.625
Our bar's falling
behind, Jimmy.

04:44.709 --> 04:46.417
Let me hire a mixologist--

04:46.500 --> 04:48.625
someone who wears
suspenders ironically.

04:48.709 --> 04:50.041
All right, fine.

04:50.125 --> 04:51.041
You want to hire
a mixologist, go ahead.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.458
To work alongside Willy.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.500
Now, you want some
tips on hiring?

04:53.583 --> 04:54.834
Don't worry, I got this.

04:54.917 --> 04:56.667
Fine. Hire away.
You feel better?

04:56.750 --> 04:58.333
Yeah, actually, I do.

04:58.417 --> 05:00.959
As the first woman in my family
to graduate college, it's--

05:01.041 --> 05:03.000
You see? I listen!
I'm not afraid of intimacy!

05:03.083 --> 05:04.166
I'm going to
get to know my son

05:04.250 --> 05:05.709
the same way
his mother does.

05:05.792 --> 05:07.667
WILLY:
Ooh! Wow! Ooh!

05:07.750 --> 05:09.542
This one's a tough one.
Geez!

05:09.625 --> 05:10.917
(Willy chuckles)

05:12.000 --> 05:13.250
Um, Mom... so, today,

05:13.333 --> 05:14.750
Vanessa told me she's
into my eyes.

05:14.834 --> 05:16.417
Score.
I know.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.458
So, I was gonna be, like,

05:17.542 --> 05:19.750
"Really? 'Cause I'm into you."

05:19.834 --> 05:21.667
Then Edie needed to be changed,

05:21.750 --> 05:23.375
and by the time I was done
with her diaper,

05:23.458 --> 05:24.792
Vanessa was texting
some guy named Jorge.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.667
Hey, uh, what do
you think the emojis

05:26.750 --> 05:28.542
cucumber, cucumber,
yogurt cup mean?

05:28.625 --> 05:30.166
Nothing good.

05:30.250 --> 05:31.417
Great for Jorge, though.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.709
Mm.

05:32.792 --> 05:33.834
So, uh...

05:33.917 --> 05:35.166
what movie we watching?

05:35.250 --> 05:37.792
A little Parisian
gem called...

05:37.875 --> 05:39.417
Are we getting
our<i> Amelie </i>on?

05:39.500 --> 05:40.834
You know it.

05:40.917 --> 05:41.834
(music begins on video)

05:41.917 --> 05:43.709
Hey...

05:44.792 --> 05:47.000
This is normal, right?

05:47.083 --> 05:48.500
Of course.

05:48.583 --> 05:49.750
I mean, I don't like
when our feet touch, but...

05:49.834 --> 05:51.709
Ew.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.208
Oh...

05:53.291 --> 05:55.166
what kind of a
<i>Grey Gardens </i>nightmare

05:55.250 --> 05:56.166
did I just walk into?

05:56.250 --> 05:57.417
What are you doing here?

05:57.500 --> 05:58.709
You and I are gonna
hang out tonight.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.709
We're gonna bomb the crap
out of each other.

06:00.792 --> 06:02.583
You are?
Mm-hmm.

06:02.667 --> 06:03.709
I'm gonna find out

06:03.792 --> 06:05.041
what makes
Gerald E. Kingsley tick.

06:05.125 --> 06:06.333
You know my middle initial.

06:06.417 --> 06:07.709
I don't know what it stands for,

06:07.792 --> 06:08.917
but leave something for later.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.291
I w... I would love to hang.

06:10.375 --> 06:11.709
Uh, um...

06:11.792 --> 06:13.250
we were, we were
gonna watch a movie.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.458
SARA:
Oh!

06:14.542 --> 06:15.792
No!

06:15.875 --> 06:17.208
You guys should go.

06:17.291 --> 06:18.750
I can't even remember
the last time

06:18.834 --> 06:21.291
I had a free night
to myself, to just relax.

06:21.375 --> 06:22.709
I can't wait to...

06:22.792 --> 06:24.583
read that... book.

06:24.667 --> 06:25.750
Okay. I'm ready.

06:25.834 --> 06:26.750
You sure you don't
want to change?

06:26.834 --> 06:28.750
No. I'm good.

06:28.834 --> 06:30.750
Shotgun!

06:30.834 --> 06:32.750
There's no book, is there?

06:32.834 --> 06:33.959
There could be a book.

06:34.041 --> 06:35.250
Ha!

06:37.625 --> 06:40.542
♪ Oh, oh! Oh, oh! ♪

06:40.625 --> 06:41.750
♪ Oh, oh! ♪

06:41.834 --> 06:42.959
Hey...

06:43.041 --> 06:44.375
who's the guy
with the sick hat?

06:44.458 --> 06:46.709
He is keeping it tight
under that vest.

06:46.792 --> 06:49.083
He's the new mixologist
I hired.

06:49.166 --> 06:51.166
Big mistake.
Don't rock the boat.
Trust me, sister.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.750
Not your sister.
Not our dynamic.

06:52.834 --> 06:54.542
Let me take you back
to 2008.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.750
A young Indian dreamer
decides to invent

06:56.834 --> 06:58.458
a fun summer soup.

06:58.542 --> 07:00.583
But... turns out Jimmy

07:00.667 --> 07:03.000
wasn't ready for
the cream of pork.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.333
Cream of pork?

07:04.417 --> 07:05.583
In the summer?

07:05.667 --> 07:07.667
It was chilled.
Why does...? The...

07:07.750 --> 07:10.208
That mixologist,
he's your cream of pork.

07:10.291 --> 07:11.542
He might be delicious,

07:11.625 --> 07:13.500
but don't mess
with what's working.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.875
Don't equate my
smart hiring decision

07:15.959 --> 07:17.417
to your nightmare soup.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.417
I got this.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.583
How about a drink?

07:23.667 --> 07:25.542

16-year-old bourbon?

10:41.875 --> 10:43.375
I don't need a partner.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.500
Sorry, Willy,
but the decision has been made.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.458
Wait, you hired
Salvador Dalí here

10:47.542 --> 10:49.417
without asking me?

10:49.500 --> 10:51.333
Give us a minute.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.959
I don't have to ask you.

10:53.041 --> 10:54.709
I'm your boss.

10:54.792 --> 10:55.792

Willy...

10:59.208 --> 11:01.125
Jimmy's not gonna
like this.

11:01.208 --> 11:03.792
You know, I gave
Jimmy his first job.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.792
You did?
Yeah, mm-hmm.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.709
I hired him as a bar-back
in '84 at Dan Tana's.

11:08.792 --> 11:10.542
The kid dropped
everything.

11:10.625 --> 11:11.834
One day,
he broke an entire

11:11.917 --> 11:13.792
thousand-dollar bottle
of merlot.

11:13.875 --> 11:16.500
Now, they were gonna fire him.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.083
But I figured he was too pretty

11:18.166 --> 11:19.834
and too delicate
to hack it on the outside.

11:19.917 --> 11:21.834
So I took the fall.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.625
And that's when Jimmy
vowed to me

11:23.709 --> 11:25.083
that when he got
his own restaurant,

11:25.166 --> 11:26.375
he'd take care of me.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.834
And we've been together
ever since.

11:28.917 --> 11:31.166
I guess you ruined everything.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.792
Ha-cha-cha.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.709
You still got this?

11:35.792 --> 11:37.291
I do.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.166
This will not be
my chilled pork soup.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.792
Well, you should
taste it first.

11:43.750 --> 11:44.667
East Hollywood Minimart, right?

11:44.750 --> 11:46.291
Best soft-serve in L.A.

11:46.375 --> 11:47.583

11:47.667 --> 11:48.917
Mmm, yummy!

11:49.041 --> 11:50.166
Right?
Yeah.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.291
Tonight was the best, man.

11:52.375 --> 11:53.750
I mean, we didn't really
talk about anything,

11:53.834 --> 11:54.875
but who cares, right?

11:56.250 --> 11:58.166
All right.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.834
"Ponyboy and Sushi"--
you got one question.

11:59.917 --> 12:01.166
Shoot.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.166
Yes! Okay, um,

12:03.250 --> 12:05.542
(stammers) Did she
know how you felt?

12:05.625 --> 12:07.125
No, no! Wait, wait!
Why didn't you tell her?

12:07.208 --> 12:08.917
(stammers)
Do you still love her?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.500
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.125
All right,
when I met your mom,

12:14.208 --> 12:16.792
she was this, uh,
she was this hot rocker chick.

12:16.875 --> 12:19.166
All right,
she was the only girl cook

12:19.250 --> 12:21.125
in this restaurant
we worked at and-- oh, God--

12:21.208 --> 12:23.166
I chased her for months before
she gave me the time of day.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.834
Then we started dating,
and, uh... you know,

12:25.917 --> 12:27.625
I was this young hot shot.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.625
I always had
one foot out the door.

12:29.709 --> 12:32.875
But, I mean, y-you said she's
the only girl you've ever loved.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.250
Yes, yes, but I thought

12:35.333 --> 12:37.583
the timing was all wrong.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.667
I thought that I had forever.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.500
But, see, that's
the thing about timing.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.125
Delay, delay, delay,

12:43.208 --> 12:46.959
then suddenly...
it's too late.

12:47.041 --> 12:49.208
Ancient history.

12:49.291 --> 12:50.750
"Suddenly it's too late."

12:50.834 --> 12:52.208
Wow, it's so--

12:52.291 --> 12:53.458
No, don't-don't start.
Don't start that.

12:53.542 --> 12:55.208
I'm a sympathy vomiter.

12:55.291 --> 12:56.625
(both retching)

12:56.709 --> 12:58.542
Okay, see, now it's--

12:58.625 --> 13:00.208
I'm gonna get us some water.

13:00.291 --> 13:01.792
Hold on, stay right there.

13:03.291 --> 13:05.500
They didn't have water,
so I got this

13:05.583 --> 13:08.083
foreign soda
called So Funky.

13:08.166 --> 13:10.291

13:11.291 --> 13:13.667

13:13.750 --> 13:16.125

13:16.208 --> 13:17.375

13:17.458 --> 13:19.375
I'll be your Gerald.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.250
No thank you.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.333

13:24.375 --> 13:26.291

13:26.375 --> 13:27.959

13:28.041 --> 13:29.291
Yeah, it's 9:45.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.125
Correct.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.875
I was just getting
ready to go out.

13:32.959 --> 13:35.208
This is the robe I wear
when I'm getting ready to--

13:35.291 --> 13:36.333
We don't have time
for your weird little lie!

13:36.417 --> 13:38.250
I lost our son!

13:38.333 --> 13:39.250
He drank $300-worth
of small-batch bourbon

13:39.333 --> 13:40.458
and just disappeared.

13:40.542 --> 13:42.250
Oh, relax, you and I never had

13:42.333 --> 13:43.667
a night out
when we weren't drunk.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.250
You didn't see the kid.
He peed in my ficus.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.542
He's not answering.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.250
Okay, fine.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.583
I'll go get the dress

13:49.667 --> 13:51.792
I was gonna put on
right before you--

13:51.875 --> 13:54.291
Nobody cares what time
you went to bed.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.375
This gift basket is full of hay!

13:56.458 --> 13:58.417
That it on the Jordan almonds?

13:58.500 --> 13:59.917
You can have all the
Jordan almonds you want

14:00.000 --> 14:01.291
if you come back.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.792
It's never been
about the almonds for me.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.792
You expect me to work
alongside this teenage bobo.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.500
That's very disrespectful.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.125
You're right.
Ravi, give him some money.

14:11.208 --> 14:12.458
No, why don't you
give me some money?

14:12.542 --> 14:14.041
You're always eating
my Indian sweets.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.667
No, I'm not.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.083
the gulab jamun
on your breath right now.

14:18.166 --> 14:21.709
Willy, please come
back, please.

14:21.792 --> 14:23.583
You know what?
This gets a big old

14:23.667 --> 14:26.375
"I don't need it."

14:26.458 --> 14:29.291
Hey, guys,
I made some snacks.

14:29.375 --> 14:32.291
Luckily, I always keep
mini-quiches on hand

14:32.375 --> 14:35.959
in case anyone drops by
to visit me or dad.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.458
I throw away
a lot of mini-quiches.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.041
Mmm.

14:41.125 --> 14:42.333
You made this?

14:42.417 --> 14:44.166
Oh, yeah.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.375
It's something I like
to call a Tahitian julep.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.583
Instead of mint,
I use passion fruit.

14:48.667 --> 14:49.583
You're a bartender, too?

14:49.667 --> 14:51.041
Oh, not really.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.625
I can't travel 'cause of Dad,

14:52.709 --> 14:55.166
so I like to make things
that taste like

14:55.250 --> 14:56.375
the places I'll never see.

14:56.458 --> 14:58.417
(chuckles)

15:02.417 --> 15:04.250
Willy?

15:04.333 --> 15:05.750
How would you like
to work with someone

15:05.834 --> 15:08.333
talented, free-spirited
and beautiful?

15:08.417 --> 15:09.792
You know Rachel Ray?

15:12.250 --> 15:14.250
SARA:
<i>What were you guys</i>
<i>doing over here?</i>

15:14.333 --> 15:15.333
Eating ice cream.

15:15.417 --> 15:17.041
Ooh! East Hollywood
Minimart?

15:17.125 --> 15:18.291
It's so depressing that

15:18.375 --> 15:19.750
that's a destination
for you two.

15:19.834 --> 15:22.000
Hey, maybe we should
just give up.

There was one summer
where he spent every day

15:39.458 --> 15:41.750
in a sporting goods store
because I couldn't afford camp.

15:41.834 --> 15:43.375
