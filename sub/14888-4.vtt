Balki, there's no stamp on this.

01:43.433 --> 01:47.800
Balki, Larry, something
wonderful has happened.

01:47.833 --> 01:50.700
This is the greatest
day of my life.

01:50.733 --> 01:52.600
Ms. Lydia, what‐what is it?

01:52.633 --> 01:56.400
Chuck Panama called and
he's coming to my party tonight.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.333
Get out of the city!

01:59.600 --> 02:02.333
The Chuck Panama?

02:02.366 --> 02:04.666
The one they named
the canal after?

02:07.466 --> 02:11.000
No, Balki,
you're thinking of Chuck Suez.

02:15.633 --> 02:18.633
Chuck Panama happens
to be one of the hottest

02:18.666 --> 02:21.433
record producers
in America today.

02:21.466 --> 02:24.700
I've dreamed of being
a singer all my life.

02:24.733 --> 02:27.600
I've even had people tell me
I'm a young Barbara Streisand.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.533
If I get a chance
to sing for Chuck

02:31.566 --> 02:35.366
my Grammy
is just around the corner.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.066
Oh, I would love
to meet your grammy!

02:41.700 --> 02:43.066
Is she coming to the party?

02:43.100 --> 02:44.700
No, no. No, no, no!

02:44.733 --> 02:47.066
She, uh, hates parties.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.166
But you could do me
an incy‐teensy favor.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.266
I can't get a piano delivered
to my apartment tonight

02:53.300 --> 02:56.133
so I thought since you guys
are coming to the party

02:56.166 --> 02:57.766
you could pick it up
on your way.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.600
Perfect. We were going to ask
you if we could bring anything.

03:02.433 --> 03:06.500
We'd love to,
but I have a back problem.

03:06.533 --> 03:09.466
If I don't get a chance
to sing for Chuck Panama

03:09.500 --> 03:11.300
my life will be meaningless.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.333
The only thing worse
than a meaningless life

03:17.366 --> 03:19.066
is a bad back.

Oh, Ms. Lydia,
I promise you get your piano.

03:26.066 --> 03:28.266
Cousin, don't worry,
I'll do all the work.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.466
I always do all the work.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.466
Terrific! Terrific!

for the piano.

Try to be a little bit early

03:34.633 --> 03:35.700
I want to do a sound check.

03:35.733 --> 03:37.100
Thanks!

03:41.800 --> 03:43.700
Now, why did you do that?

03:45.166 --> 03:47.033
I want to go to a party
and have fun.

03:47.066 --> 03:49.766
I don't wanna work up
a sweat moving a piano.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.266
Now, cousin,
that is where Balki

03:52.300 --> 03:56.266
has his thinking cap
pulled way down over his ears.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.233
We're not going
to bust our buttocks

03:58.266 --> 03:59.800
we're going to rent
one of those trucks

03:59.833 --> 04:02.166

elevator on the back.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.200

04:04.233 --> 04:06.466
your underarms
will stay nice and dry..

04:08.366 --> 04:11.600
...and because you have helped a
friend you'll feel good inside.

04:11.633 --> 04:12.733
What you say?

04:14.333 --> 04:16.565
Alright, alright.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.766
I'll move the piano.
But I won't feel good inside.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.266
‐ Yeah. Yes, you will.
‐ No, I won't.

‐ No, I won't.

05:02.733 --> 05:04.433
You thought
this was gonna be hard

05:04.466 --> 05:07.666
but it's gonna be just as easy
as pushing goats up a hill.

05:21.566 --> 05:23.400
Looks like
one of the goats doesn't fit.

around like this and voila!

How are we going to get this
up to Ms. Lydia's apartment?

05:49.166 --> 05:50.566
Answer. We don't.

our best shot, it didn't work.

And no.

06:27.366 --> 06:29.366

06:29.400 --> 06:30.733
Oh, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

06:30.766 --> 06:33.433
I didn't promise anybody
anything. You promised.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.600
You know, you're right.

06:36.633 --> 06:40.400
I promised.
You didn't promise.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.533

go upstairs to the party

‐ Oh, thank you, cousin.
‐ Uh!

07:31.133 --> 07:33.133
Now..

07:33.166 --> 07:36.100
What we need first is a plan.

07:36.133 --> 07:39.066

one of your plans

07:39.100 --> 07:40.166
more than I do..

07:42.333 --> 07:44.733
But I was just thinking maybe
we could just pick it up and go.

07:44.766 --> 07:45.966
‐ Oh, just pick it up and go?
‐ Just pick it up and go.

Balki, just pick it up and go?

in their hands?

07:59.800 --> 08:00.700
No.

toenails with a bolt cutter?

08:06.266 --> 08:07.033
No!

08:10.666 --> 08:13.500
Sleeping out in the open
and letting little bugs crawl

08:13.533 --> 08:16.166
in their ears
and make nests and then..

08:16.200 --> 08:17.766
...they start to buzz and buzz

08:17.800 --> 08:18.866
until you think
you're gonna go crazy

08:18.900 --> 08:20.533
but you just take a little
Q‐Tip and get in there..

08:20.566 --> 08:22.600
No, no, no,
Balki, Balki, Balki.

08:26.433 --> 08:29.066
The most common way
people hurt themselves

08:29.100 --> 08:33.533
is by lifting
heavy objects incorrectly.

08:33.566 --> 08:35.700
‐ Really?
‐ Yes, they do.

08:35.732 --> 08:40.100
Now, the secret
to lifting a piano

08:40.133 --> 08:43.633
is to let your legs
do all the work.

08:43.666 --> 08:46.200
It's all in the legs.

08:47.066 --> 08:49.333
All in the legs.

08:49.366 --> 08:51.100

08:58.566 --> 09:00.133
‐ I like this.
‐ I thought you would.

09:01.566 --> 09:05.333
Now...on the count of three..

09:05.366 --> 09:06.600
...we will lift..

Other side,
other side, other side.

09:12.233 --> 09:14.666
On the count of three
we will lift the piano up

09:14.700 --> 09:16.766
one step and set it down.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.233
What we are trying to do
is establish a rhythm.

09:19.266 --> 09:21.000
Hey, I got rhythm!

09:22.800 --> 09:25.100
I got music.

into helping other people?

10:51.233 --> 10:54.100
Why do I listen?
I could have said no.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.600

Good news, cousin.

My pants are ripped?

Yeah, I was going to tell you
earlier but then I thought..

if there's one thing

that this simple Mypiot knows

that is, that if you do
something good for other people

Cousin, did Steven King ever
write anything about the piano?

18:40.200 --> 18:42.700
There's got to be
a logical explanation.

18:42.733 --> 18:44.600
Pianos don't follow people.

18:45.766 --> 18:47.233
Maybe the floors are uneven.

Oh, Balki! Larry!
I didn't see you at the party.

Did I invite you to the party?

21:03.133 --> 21:06.133
Lydia, we were
moving your piano.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.733
Oh, that. Funny thing.

21:08.766 --> 21:11.600
I didn't need
that piano after all.

21:11.633 --> 21:14.466
I used a background tape.
It had a full orchestra.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.533
It just supported my voice
so much better than

21:16.566 --> 21:18.400

Well, that's, that's
fortunate, Ms. Lydia

21:29.700 --> 21:33.766

now bears a striking resemblance

21:33.800 --> 21:35.733
