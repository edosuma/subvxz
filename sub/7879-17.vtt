What's wrong, Roger?

00:39.372 --> 00:41.316
Something ate holes
in all my sweaters!

00:41.441 --> 00:42.626
They're ruined!

00:42.792 --> 00:44.211
Gracious...

00:44.377 --> 00:46.805
Some of my best costumes
are sweater-based.

00:46.930 --> 00:50.308
How am I supposed to be Japanese
subway molester Shinju Omigawa

00:50.433 --> 00:52.401
without his baby blue cardigan?!

00:53.837 --> 00:55.013
That's the culprit, right there!

00:55.138 --> 00:56.214
Step on him, Steve!

00:56.339 --> 00:57.773
I don't want to mess up my shoes.

00:59.308 --> 01:00.485
We can't kill it.

01:00.610 --> 01:02.120
That caterpillar is going to

01:02.245 --> 01:04.355
change into a beautiful butterfly.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.291
It's ugly and disgusting,
like Frankie Muniz!

01:06.416 --> 01:07.926
And it's just going to become a moth

01:08.051 --> 01:09.427
and stay ugly and disgusting...

01:09.552 --> 01:11.396
like Frankie Muniz.

01:11.521 --> 01:13.465
Big Clippers fan.

01:13.590 --> 01:15.133
Things can change
for the better, Roger.

01:15.258 --> 01:16.326
And I'm going to prove it.

01:16.492 --> 01:18.253
This little guy will be a butterfly.

01:18.378 --> 01:19.746
You'll see.

01:19.912 --> 01:22.290
First of all, those jars
are for farts only.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.159
Second, I...
What is that?

01:24.284 --> 01:25.961
Oh, no...

01:26.086 --> 01:28.213
I always put gross stuff
in trash bags

01:28.338 --> 01:29.965
in the back of the closet and
then forget about them.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.483
Who knows what's in there!

01:31.608 --> 01:34.094
Oh, man, this is gonna be gross.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.512
Why don't you just dump it out?

01:35.678 --> 01:37.372
Oh, man, here it comes.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.307
It's gonna be...
Wait, what's this?

01:39.473 --> 01:41.143
It's a costume!

01:41.268 --> 01:42.878
And it's lovely!

01:43.003 --> 01:45.447
Leather vest, non-matching
leather pants,

01:45.572 --> 01:47.816
Albuquerque Zoo
Discovery Center T-shirt...

01:47.941 --> 01:49.568
Why did I ever stop wearing this?

01:49.859 --> 01:51.136
Well, what character is it for?

01:51.402 --> 01:52.571
I can't remember.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.055
Well, who cares?!

01:54.180 --> 01:55.891
I'm taking this show into town.

01:56.016 --> 01:58.510
This is the perfect outfit
for getting yogurt!

01:58.635 --> 02:00.918
I'm gonna get so many tiny M&Ms!

02:01.043 --> 02:02.397
Get out of there, Snickers fragment,

02:02.522 --> 02:04.041
you're not welcome here!

02:05.325 --> 02:06.451
I got it!

02:06.576 --> 02:07.435
You opened it last time!

02:07.560 --> 02:08.436
Cup check!

02:08.561 --> 02:10.672

Ooh, Mr. and Mrs.

Mm-hmm.
Aah!

02:14.834 --> 02:15.802
Can we help you?

02:15.968 --> 02:18.597
It's me... Tungee!

02:18.763 --> 02:19.447
Who?

02:19.572 --> 02:21.816
Tungee from Nigeria!

02:21.941 --> 02:23.652
I was the child you sponsored for

02:23.777 --> 02:26.271
just the price of
a cup of coffee a day!

02:26.396 --> 02:28.139
Oh, my god! Tungee?

02:28.264 --> 02:29.975
You're real?

02:30.100 --> 02:31.643
What are you doing here?

02:31.768 --> 02:33.945
I come to live with you!

Steve, you gotta bring me
a change of clothes!

03:29.409 --> 03:30.852
Not a good time.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.237
I'm pleating my intimates.

03:32.362 --> 03:33.421
You don't understand!

03:33.546 --> 03:35.874
The costume I found...
it's Ricky Spanish!

03:35.999 --> 03:37.916
It's Ricky Spanish!

03:39.552 --> 03:42.047
Ugh, yes!

Get Ricky Spanish!

03:43.656 --> 03:46.658
He's the only one
this angry mob should be after!

03:54.667 --> 03:56.077
This is wonderful!

03:56.202 --> 03:57.912
I am actually eating enough food

03:58.037 --> 03:59.648
to produce a poop!

03:59.773 --> 04:01.750
So... Tungee,

04:01.875 --> 04:04.352
what made you decide to come find us?

04:04.477 --> 04:05.996
Your letters.

04:06.162 --> 04:09.057
Dear Tungee,
we think about you every day.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.992
We wish we could give you
a roof over your head

04:11.117 --> 04:14.095
and t-shirts from the teams that
actually won the Super Bowl.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.731
Yours always,
Stan and Francine Smith.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.533
Why would you write that?

04:18.658 --> 04:20.402
I didn't think he'd live past ten.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.787
Oh, Tungee.

04:22.912 --> 04:24.990
We're glad you're here but...

04:25.115 --> 04:26.891
How long you plan on staying?

04:27.016 --> 04:28.493
You said a short time, right, Tunj?

04:28.768 --> 04:31.153
Yes, yes, I will stay forever!

04:32.956 --> 04:34.699
Is there any chance
you're gonna surprise us

04:34.824 --> 04:35.901
and be the prince of Zamunda?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.903
None!

04:41.530 --> 04:43.499
Show your face, Ricky Spanish!

04:45.718 --> 04:47.379
Okay, I'm at the alley whe

04:47.504 --> 04:49.597
we rolled dice on
Paula Abdul's dead body.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.816
Gimme the clothes, gimme!

04:51.941 --> 04:52.851
We gotta get out of here!

04:53.125 --> 04:54.285
What's going on, Roger?

04:54.410 --> 04:55.879
Who is Ricky Spanish?

04:56.045 --> 04:58.223
The worst persona I've ever done.

04:58.348 --> 04:59.257
Oh, come on.

04:59.423 --> 05:00.492
It's true.

05:00.617 --> 05:02.694
He's a lying, thieving sociopath.

05:02.819 --> 05:04.329
There's hardly a person in this town

05:04.454 --> 05:06.197
who he hasn't stolen from, cheated...

05:06.322 --> 05:07.532
or worse...

05:07.657 --> 05:09.226
Everyone hates Ricky Spanish.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.519
Ricky Spanish...

05:13.429 --> 05:15.315
Come on!

05:15.481 --> 05:18.109
Wow. Sounds like Ricky Spanish...

05:18.275 --> 05:20.612
<i>Ricky Spanish...</i>

05:20.778 --> 05:22.480
... really is your
worst persona ever.

05:22.605 --> 05:23.932
Keep your voice down!

05:24.057 --> 05:25.659
These people will kill me
if they find out I'm...

05:25.825 --> 05:28.160
<i>Ricky Spanish...</i>

05:32.215 --> 05:33.658
Eh!

05:33.783 --> 05:35.794
Wait, you're burning up
Ricky Spanish?

05:35.960 --> 05:37.946
<i>Ricky Spanish...</i>

05:38.212 --> 05:39.297
I have no choice.

05:39.463 --> 05:40.715
I love being Ricky.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.167
I mean, the outfit alone...

05:42.292 --> 05:43.985
But everyone around here hates him.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.304
That's the downside
of living in a smallown.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.123
Everyone is in everybody's business.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.024
God, I want to move to New York.

05:50.149 --> 05:51.526
But I'm scared, ya know?

05:51.651 --> 05:53.495
It seems like something you do
if you have no money

05:53.620 --> 05:56.106
or a lot of money and
I'm sort of in between.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.632
You can still be Ricky.

05:57.757 --> 06:00.527
Just make him a better person,
then people will like him.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.779
Ricky can't be redeemed, Steve.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.355
I don't believe that.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.374
Everyone can change for the better.

06:06.499 --> 06:09.494
This guy's going to do it
and so can Ricky.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.653
<i>Ricky Spanish...</i>

06:13.890 --> 06:16.334
You... you really think I can change?

06:16.625 --> 06:18.636
Bitch, what did I just say?

06:18.761 --> 06:20.738
Come on, I'll help you make amends

06:20.863 --> 06:22.364
with every person you've wronged.

06:23.666 --> 06:24.642
Okay.

06:24.767 --> 06:25.710
Let's do it!

06:25.835 --> 06:28.012
Awesome!
This is gonna be great!

06:28.137 --> 06:32.142
And I guarantee you, everyone
you wronged will forgive you.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.067
Kill.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.018
You.

06:34.143 --> 06:35.069
Ricky.

06:35.194 --> 06:36.070
Spanish.

06:36.195 --> 06:37.071
Kill.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.056
You.

06:38.181 --> 06:40.308
Ricky... Spanish.

06:40.433 --> 06:43.445
This exercising to things
you hate is really working!

06:44.771 --> 06:45.864
Jean.

06:45.989 --> 06:46.898
Jackets.

06:47.023 --> 06:47.899
Timothy's.

06:48.024 --> 06:48.900
Bangs.

06:49.025 --> 06:49.901
Jean.

06:50.026 --> 06:50.902
Jackets.

06:51.027 --> 06:52.829
Timothy's bangs.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.826
Carol, I robbed.

06:58.951 --> 07:00.278
Eduardo, I stabbed.

07:00.403 --> 07:02.030
Tina, I taught how to kiss.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.449
Gave her some bad information,
never corrected it.

07:04.574 --> 07:06.274
She's out there darting
her tongue like this.

07:08.244 --> 07:10.338
Well, get ready, 'cause
we're gonna make amends

07:10.463 --> 07:11.673
with everyone on that list

07:11.798 --> 07:13.741
until Ricky Spanish is redeemed.

07:13.866 --> 07:16.102
Okay, who's first?

07:20.640 --> 07:21.524
Brian?

07:21.690 --> 07:22.525
It's me, Ri...

07:22.733 --> 07:24.903
Damn you, Ricky Spanish!

07:25.069 --> 07:27.288
He's here to apologize! Geez!

07:27.413 --> 07:29.140
What did Ricky do to you, anyway?

07:29.265 --> 07:31.451
Tijuana!
He did Tijuana to me!

07:31.768 --> 07:34.612
<i>Oh, we were having
ourselves a fine old time,</i>

07:34.737 --> 07:37.615
<i>down Mexico way.</i>

07:37.740 --> 07:39.384
Oh, I can take care of you.

07:39.509 --> 07:40.818
<i>Then, out of the blue,</i>

07:40.943 --> 07:42.244
<i>Ricky jumped me and left me stranded!</i>

07:47.617 --> 07:50.828
With no I.D., I was stuck
in TJ for six months!

07:50.953 --> 07:53.598
I had to work as the squeegee
boy at a donkey show.

07:53.823 --> 07:55.867
Every night,
watching a different girl

07:55.992 --> 07:58.937
sleep with the donkey I loved.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.506
Brian, I'm so sorry.

08:01.631 --> 08:04.575
I was a bad guy,
but I'm trying to change!

08:04.700 --> 08:05.910
Aw, hell, Ricky.

08:06.035 --> 08:07.645
I can't stay mad at you!

08:07.770 --> 08:11.449
I'm on way too many anti-psychotics!

08:13.033 --> 08:14.327
Yeah!

08:21.767 --> 08:23.111
Steve Smith!

08:23.236 --> 08:24.962
Ricky Spanish!

08:25.087 --> 08:27.265
We're doing cocaine
and shooting guns!

08:27.390 --> 08:28.508
Join us!

08:31.244 --> 08:35.472
I just met this woman, but I'm
already really into it!

08:39.268 --> 08:42.169
Avery, I'm here to apologize for...

08:44.407 --> 08:45.650
... for killing your wife.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.884
Killing my wife?!

08:47.009 --> 08:48.086
When?

08:48.211 --> 08:49.053
You seriously don't remember?

08:49.178 --> 08:50.555
Hey, man...

08:50.680 --> 08:52.115
It was her birthday...

08:52.381 --> 08:55.109
<i>and you know how I am
when I drink champagne...</i>

08:56.953 --> 09:01.232
Oh, yes, I seem to recall
something like that.

09:01.357 --> 09:03.101
So...
you're not mad at me?

09:03.226 --> 09:04.736
Why should I be?

09:04.861 --> 09:08.856
As you can see, everything in
my life is going perfectly.

09:16.513 --> 09:18.316
This is really working, Steve!

09:18.441 --> 09:20.051
They forgave me, and I feel great!

09:20.176 --> 09:21.419
See?

09:21.544 --> 09:23.321
I told you anyone can
change for the better.

09:23.446 --> 09:25.398
Okay, next up is Daniel.

09:25.564 --> 09:26.557
Daniel?!

09:26.682 --> 09:28.192
I can't face Daniel!

09:28.317 --> 09:29.994
What I did to him was too horrible!

09:30.119 --> 09:31.446
Skip down!
Skip down to someone else!

09:31.571 --> 09:32.480
No, forget it.

09:32.605 --> 09:33.648
Let's start a business.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.650
We'll buy a truck
and do pedicures in it.

09:35.775 --> 09:38.035
We'll call it "Nail Salon
Wheels Truck," I don't know!

09:38.160 --> 09:39.361
Wait, who's Daniel?

09:41.230 --> 09:43.775
We worked together
at Plantain Republic.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.761
He told me about a huge sweater
shipment and we stole it.

09:46.886 --> 09:49.330
But the heist went bad and I
pinned the whole thing on him.

09:49.455 --> 09:51.783
He's been in jail ever since.

09:51.908 --> 09:53.593
I can't do this anymore!

09:53.759 --> 09:55.136
I feel constricted!

09:55.261 --> 09:57.121
I can't breathe!

10:00.750 --> 10:03.528
That's just the cocoon you
feel around you, Roger.

10:03.653 --> 10:06.764
You're changing into something
better, like this little guy.

10:08.090 --> 10:08.942
You think?

10:09.108 --> 10:10.501
Yes!

10:10.626 --> 10:12.695
I know it's not easy, but you
have to stick it out.

10:12.995 --> 10:14.605
It's like <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

10:14.730 --> 10:17.942
The opening sketch stinks,
the monologue is awful,

10:18.067 --> 10:19.544
but then Keenan does
"What up with that?"

10:19.669 --> 10:21.112
and it's all worth it.

10:21.237 --> 10:24.015
Okay... Okay...
I'll face Daniel...

10:24.140 --> 10:26.741
right after I finish huffing
whatever's in this bag.

10:37.010 --> 10:39.263
This water is wonderful!

10:39.388 --> 10:41.916
And there is not one parasite
swimming up my urethra!

10:42.041 --> 10:44.335
I love this place!

10:44.460 --> 10:48.456
Ugh! He's so positive and
grateful about everything.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.474
Yeah, I'm having a hard time
taking things for granted

10:50.599 --> 10:51.742
with this kid in the house.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.744
We gotta ditch him.

10:53.869 --> 10:55.062
Hey, Tungee!

10:55.187 --> 10:57.215
Want to run an errand
with Mama and Papa?

10:57.340 --> 10:58.683
An errand?
An errand?

10:58.808 --> 11:00.618
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!

11:00.743 --> 11:01.986
What is this errand?!
Yes!

11:08.917 --> 11:10.561
Are you sure we can
just leave him here?

11:10.686 --> 11:11.996
He'll be fine.

11:12.121 --> 11:14.582
He can live off free food
samples, watch HD television...

11:14.707 --> 11:15.900
and look at the high ceiling...

11:16.025 --> 11:17.985
he can grow as tall
as he wants in here.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.513
Okay, let's just get this over with.

11:20.679 --> 11:23.190
Tungee, go get us a pair
of really rough dungarees

11:23.315 --> 11:24.892
and a ten-pack of snow tires.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.485
I will do it, Mr. and Lady Smith.

11:34.977 --> 11:37.572
Hey, how did you get
Daniel out so fast anyway?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.491
Let's just say I have
an in with the judge.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.644
I sentence you to life in prison.

11:50.242 --> 11:53.821
Oh, Edith, you are
the only thing in this world

11:53.946 --> 11:55.798
that makes sense to me.

11:55.964 --> 11:57.808
Welcome home, dear.

11:57.933 --> 11:59.802
Can I talk to you about something?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.747
You, y-you've been
married for 35 years?

12:02.872 --> 12:04.649
How do you even have the time?

12:04.774 --> 12:07.018
If it's important you find the time.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.144
Ricky!

12:08.310 --> 12:10.313
I should kill you right here.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.858
Please, Daniel, I got
you out of prison.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.319
You got me sent there
in the first place!

12:16.485 --> 12:18.145
I'll make it up to you, I swear.

12:18.270 --> 12:21.799
Give him a chance, sir,
he's a changed man.

12:21.924 --> 12:25.086
All right, I'll give you
a week to make it up to me,

12:25.211 --> 12:27.979
and if you don't, you die.

12:30.207 --> 12:33.678
Have you been in there
this whole time?

12:33.803 --> 12:35.004
Huh.

12:35.170 --> 12:37.081
Wait, so where did we park?
