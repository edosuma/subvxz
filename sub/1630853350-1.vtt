00:00.626 --> 00:02.420
<i>Previously on</i> Bosch.

00:02.420 --> 00:06.674
<i>You know, on my desk at work,
I have pictures of three young women.</i>

00:06.674 --> 00:10.928
<i>They've never been identified.
Their murders have never been solved.</i>

00:10.928 --> 00:13.139
Why do you keep them, the pictures?

00:13.139 --> 00:14.223
To remind me.

00:15.641 --> 00:18.519
Everybody counts or nobody counts.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.187
Detective, when you shot
and killed Mr. Flores,

00:20.271 --> 00:22.481
weren't you, in effect,
avenging your mother's death?

00:22.565 --> 00:24.191
- Objection.
- You got a lot of fucking nerve.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.652
See you around, Detective.

00:26.736 --> 00:28.571
Most likely in court.

00:28.571 --> 00:31.532
Guys like you never stop
stepping on their own dicks.

00:32.408 --> 00:35.828
<i>Borders' claim from the get-go,
the police manipulated the evidence.</i>

00:35.828 --> 00:38.372
<i>No basis for it. It's bullshit.
I've never planted evidence.</i>

00:38.456 --> 00:39.749
I believe you.

00:39.749 --> 00:41.167
So is that a yes?

00:41.167 --> 00:45.254
How can I not take you on as a client?
It's too delicious.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.631
Like a feral cat, you don't trust anyone.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.175
You take too many risks.

00:49.175 --> 00:50.926
We're cut from the same stone,
you and I.

00:51.010 --> 00:53.012
We do what we have to.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.555
<i>Chandler drives you pretty hard.</i>

00:54.555 --> 00:56.348
<i>Just another relentless role model.</i>

00:56.432 --> 00:57.975
<i>Don't idolize her too much, Mads.</i>

00:57.975 --> 01:00.770
What, I can't admire a strong woman
who's really good at what she does?

01:00.770 --> 01:03.230
Trying to get guilty people off,
I find that hard to admire.

01:03.314 --> 01:04.648
No, I get it.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.317
When she's representing you,
she's cool,

01:06.317 --> 01:09.111
and when she's representing anybody else,
she's not.

01:09.195 --> 01:12.406
Meet me in the lobby.
Don't be late. I hope you're ready.

01:17.077 --> 01:17.995
<i>How is she?</i>

01:17.995 --> 01:19.830
<i>Stable. Still critical.</i>

01:19.914 --> 01:21.791
<i>Medically induced coma.</i>

01:21.791 --> 01:22.792
She's hanging in there.

01:22.792 --> 01:23.709
She's tough.

01:23.793 --> 01:24.627
Yeah, she is.

01:24.627 --> 01:27.963
Look, there's no easy way to say this.
You're in danger.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.549
Go back to the car!
Go back to the car!

01:39.600 --> 01:41.352
<i>So who hired them?</i>

01:41.352 --> 01:42.770
Look at the targets.

01:42.770 --> 01:46.649
Franzen, Chandler, my daughter.

01:46.649 --> 01:48.567
Who benefits if they get taken out?

01:49.610 --> 01:50.444
Carl Rogers.

01:50.528 --> 01:53.155
<i>Hedge fund guys
don't buy hits on witnesses.</i>

01:53.239 --> 01:58.285
This hedge fund guy, Carl Rogers,
he hired someone to kill me.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.537
I know.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.170
Carl Rogers.

02:08.254 --> 02:10.297
You're under arrest for murder.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.049
What are you looking at?

02:12.049 --> 02:14.260
The LAPD application portal.

02:15.219 --> 02:19.056
<i>You all do something that matters.
What am I doing with my life?</i>

02:20.558 --> 02:26.480
You may get a call asking you to vouch
for an applicant to the Police Department.

02:26.564 --> 02:27.982
Sure. Who?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.275
Um...

02:30.776 --> 02:31.610
Me.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.118
Maddie.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.996
Welcome back.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.623
I got five innocent victims
and you're asking me to stand down?

02:44.707 --> 02:47.376
Sometimes we have to make
compromises for the greater good.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.419
Bullshit.

02:48.419 --> 02:50.379
Take it.

02:50.379 --> 02:51.881
Keep it.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.049
Bosch, who are you
if you don't have a badge?

02:55.050 --> 02:56.010
I'm gonna find out.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.096
<i>To become
a state-licensed private detective,</i>

02:59.096 --> 03:01.015
you must have at least 6,000 hours

03:01.015 --> 03:03.475
of compensated experience
in investigative work.

03:03.559 --> 03:04.518
Do you have that?

03:04.602 --> 03:06.020
I do.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.605
You sure?

03:07.605 --> 03:09.899
Does 26-plus years with the LAPD count?

03:29.043 --> 03:31.337
Adam 77, continuing westbound First.

03:36.258 --> 03:39.511
Adam 77, westbound First,
approaching Vignes.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.099
North on Vignes. Northbound Vignes.

03:53.359 --> 03:54.902
Westbound Temple from Vignes.

03:54.902 --> 03:58.864
<i>Air 12, advise ground units,
roadblock on Temple.</i>

03:58.948 --> 04:00.324
- <i>Repeat, roadblock on Temple.</i>
- Clear. You're clear.

04:06.664 --> 04:10.250
Adam 77, code six on Temple.
Suspects have TCed.

04:10.334 --> 04:14.129
We're in foot pursuit.
Two male whites, dark pants, dark tops.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.590
<i>Air 12, officers in pursuit.</i>

04:16.674 --> 04:18.926
<i>Westbound Alameda and Temple.</i>

04:50.124 --> 04:51.917
Don't fucking move!

05:00.801 --> 05:03.554
Adam 77, suspect in custody.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.433
My partner is outstanding.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.476
Air 12, do you have him?

05:09.560 --> 05:11.895
<i>All Hollenbeck and Central units standby.</i>

05:11.979 --> 05:12.896
Air 12?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.565
<i>Air 12, do you have a visual?</i>

05:14.565 --> 05:19.278
Adam 77, code six with my partner,

05:19.278 --> 05:23.032
Temple north of Alameda,
one suspect in custody.

05:23.032 --> 05:23.949
Oh, man, can these guys book.

05:24.033 --> 05:25.200
What the hell were you thinking?

05:25.284 --> 05:26.118
What do you mean? I-I thought--

05:26.118 --> 05:27.870
You're not supposed to think,

05:27.870 --> 05:29.663
and you're sure as shit not supposed
to separate from your partner.

05:29.747 --> 05:31.123
There were two of them.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.374
You call for backup.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.793
You never leave your partner.
You stay with your partner.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.170
I'm writing you up, boot.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.171
What the fuck, O'Neill?

05:37.171 --> 05:39.048
You're just pissed 'cause I caught mine
and yours got away.

05:39.048 --> 05:41.508
Nice mouth.
I'm writing you up for that too.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.218
And this suspect here? He's mine.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.846
Yours got away.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.724
Get the car. Let's go.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.540
Coltrane. Come on, boy.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.127
Coltrane.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.316
Nope.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.026
<i>Try it backwards.</i>

08:07.571 --> 08:08.405
No go.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.407
<i>Backwards and upside down.</i>

08:10.407 --> 08:11.325
Upside down?

08:11.325 --> 08:13.911
<i>Yeah, yeah. Make the six a nine
and the nine a six.</i>

08:18.999 --> 08:20.083
Got it.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.060
Somebody's coming.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.478
<i>Shouldn't have opened the music box.</i>

08:39.478 --> 08:40.395
No shit.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.705
What the fuck?

09:12.469 --> 09:14.263
What's that about, man,
not taking your gun?

09:15.639 --> 09:18.058
It's about not risking
an automatic three-year enhancement

09:18.058 --> 09:19.726
on a breaking and entering charge.

09:19.810 --> 09:20.811
Mm.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.522
Hey, how'd you play the tunes?

09:23.522 --> 09:27.818
Oh, you know, tapped into the wi-fi,
found a speaker on the house network.

09:27.818 --> 09:28.735
Nifty.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.779
Basic.

09:30.779 --> 09:31.780
Bebop?

09:31.780 --> 09:34.241
Oh, "Salt Peanuts."
Man, my favorite. You?

09:34.241 --> 09:36.702
"Night in Tunisia."

09:36.702 --> 09:38.495
Oh, yeah, also good.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.164
Dizzy and Bird, baby.
Dizzy and Bird.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.916
Hey, you got anything else
for me this week?

09:43.000 --> 09:43.917
I'll let you know.

09:44.001 --> 09:48.130
Cash? Come on, Bosch,
when you gonna shake hands with Venmo?

09:48.130 --> 09:49.923
Cash is so last century.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.635
So am I, brother.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.598
So am I.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.542
- Hey, champ.
- Hey, man.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.960
How you holding up these days?

10:27.044 --> 10:28.628
Uh, I'm okay, Doc.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.714
All right, see you tomorrow.

My last night training with him,
the asshole writes me up.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.558
Can you believe that?

12:04.558 --> 12:06.143
Your first ding, right?

12:06.143 --> 12:08.770
Yeah, so far.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.856
I wouldn't worry about it.
Everybody has a hiccup.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.816
I guess.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.485
Look, if you had a perfect record,
I'd be worried.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.820
You learn from your mistakes.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.155
Theoretically.

12:18.155 --> 12:20.949
Okay, not everybody,
but you do and you will.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.202
Did you ever get written up
when you were a boot?

12:24.286 --> 12:26.997
Shit, Mads,
I barely made it through the Academy.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.624
They said I had
a deep-seated disdain for authority.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.126
Bordering on insubordination.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.377
Boy, did they get that wrong.

12:32.461 --> 12:33.420
Right?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.548
Thankfully, I never have
to work with him again.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.883
Who's your new TO?

12:37.883 --> 12:39.593
Oh, I don't know yet.
Here they are.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.971
- Good morning.
- Morning.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.681
- Maddie.
- Hey, Michelle, how you doing?

12:44.681 --> 12:46.141
Nervous.

12:46.141 --> 12:47.058
So what do you think?

12:47.142 --> 12:49.311
I don't know.
Just got the call to get here.

13:03.158 --> 13:08.538
In Case BA926534,
People versus Rodgers,

13:08.622 --> 13:12.334
the court has received a note
from the foreperson that the jury is,

13:12.334 --> 13:15.837
after four full days of deliberations,
hopelessly deadlocked,

13:15.921 --> 13:18.089
six to six.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.300
Therefore I have no choice
but to declare a mistrial.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.384
Shit.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.721
Counsel, we are now day 0 of 60.

13:24.721 --> 13:28.016
I want to set a new pretrial date
within 30 days.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.810
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I thank you for your service.

13:30.894 --> 13:31.853
We are adjourned.

13:33.522 --> 13:34.773
So does this mean a retrial?

13:34.773 --> 13:37.776
Means either that shitbird walks
or he cuts a sweetheart deal.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.863
- Miss Chandler.
- You're going to retry him, right?

13:41.947 --> 13:43.365
We will weigh our options.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.950
How is this even a question?

13:44.950 --> 13:48.954
Rogers hired a hitman who killed
four people, including a judge,

13:48.954 --> 13:52.040
shot me twice and left me for dead,
and attempted to kill

13:52.040 --> 13:55.710
that young woman over there
who is now a Los Angeles police officer.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.629
The flaws in the case
were exposed at trial

13:57.629 --> 13:59.548
when our key witness
recanted on the stand.

13:59.548 --> 14:00.924
- Alex.
- Without that,

14:00.924 --> 14:04.052
we cannot and could not
establish a direct link

14:04.052 --> 14:05.887
between Rogers and the hitman.

14:05.971 --> 14:06.972
Well, somebody got to Datz.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.265
Okay, perhaps.

14:08.265 --> 14:11.101
And absent any new evidence,
that's still a problem.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.352
Look, I understand how you feel.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.896
You have no God damn idea how I feel.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.773
Okay? None whatsoever.

14:17.941 --> 14:18.942
The office will be in touch.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.114
Come on, mama.
I'll give you a ride home.

14:31.580 --> 14:36.084
As you may have heard,
we had a 187 two nights ago

14:36.084 --> 14:38.378
outside Hollywood Charity.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.007
High-priority case.
RHD is taking the lead.

14:42.007 --> 14:45.176
Dr. Basu was a hero
to the homeless community.

14:46.261 --> 14:51.725
Of less import, the Thai Town peeping Tom
is on the prowl again.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.769
Several sightings.
Just BOLO that.

14:54.853 --> 14:59.941
And finally, we have some
Phase Two boots new to the watch.

15:01.192 --> 15:05.697
I trust you'll give them the benefit
of your experience and expertise.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.533
Raise your hand when I call your name.

15:08.617 --> 15:10.910
- Madeline Bosch.
- Here.

15:10.994 --> 15:15.081
Adam 79, Vasquez and Bosch,
East Hollywood car.

15:15.165 --> 15:15.999
Yes, sir.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.711
And just a reminder, Bosch,
and you other boots,

15:19.711 --> 15:22.213
you're not cops yet.

15:22.297 --> 15:26.051
You can still wash out
if you fail to follow basic rules,

15:26.051 --> 15:29.012
like not separating from your partner.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.431
Paulina Calderon.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.932
Here.

15:38.521 --> 15:39.773
Hi, I'm Bosch.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.900
Hit the kit room, grab our shit,
meet me at the car.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.778
Okay.

15:48.490 --> 15:51.034
Come in.

15:53.870 --> 15:54.954
How'd it go?

15:55.038 --> 15:56.915
Your ex changed the combination,
but we figured it out.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.541
Have a seat.

16:00.877 --> 16:01.711
What are these?

16:01.795 --> 16:03.046
Old cold cases.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.341
Time to time, I send out packages
to foreign countries,

16:06.341 --> 16:08.593
trying to ID these three women.

16:08.677 --> 16:09.719
Are they missing?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.889
Dead. Murdered.

16:13.765 --> 16:14.599
Oh.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.893
Chasing ghosts.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.978
Somebody has to, right?

16:19.062 --> 16:20.397
I've got your things here.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.734
Thank you so much.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.531
My grandmother's wedding ring.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.624
Her ring and her recipes.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.752
I can't thank you enough.
What do I owe you?

16:42.836 --> 16:45.964
On the house.
Just tell your dad he owes me a drink.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.174
I will do that.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.884
- Take good care.
- Thank you.

17:06.109 --> 17:06.943
What took you so long?

17:06.943 --> 17:08.111
Sorry, there was a line.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.571
Inspect the tube, make it patrol ready.

17:09.571 --> 17:11.281
Let's go, we're late.

17:23.835 --> 17:24.753
Not terrible.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.129
Next time, do it without the attitude.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.099
I heard about the other night.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.392
Yeah, everybody has.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.393
Don't interrupt.

17:40.477 --> 17:41.895
I don't care if you're a legacy

17:41.895 --> 17:44.564
and I don't care if your father
solved a thousand murders.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.442
If you ever run off
by yourself like that with me,

17:47.442 --> 17:49.235
that'll be the last time
you wear that uniform.

17:50.278 --> 17:53.072
You're a boot. You don't even know
what you don't know.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.449
This is life and death.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.785
You do your job right
or you get the fuck out of my car.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.473
I'm on hold with the DA's office.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.099
- I'll come back.
- Hang on.

18:21.184 --> 18:22.811
<i>I'm sorry. He's not available.</i>

18:22.811 --> 18:25.855
Well, tell him I'm just gonna
keep calling back until he is.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.148
<i>I'll give him the message.</i>

18:29.192 --> 18:31.236
He's gonna dump the case
and let Rogers walk.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.862
I'll reach out to him too.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.197
The Great Persuader.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.990
Keep the faith, baby.

18:36.074 --> 18:39.452
You used to say that
in class all the time.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.288
You heard about Dr. Basu?

18:42.372 --> 18:43.748
Mm. Awful.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.792
Yeah, he was a hero.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.963
During the pandemic, he devoted
hisself to the unhoused community.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.923
I gather there's already been an arrest.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.049
Yeah, a homeless man.

18:53.049 --> 18:53.967
Ironic.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.219
No, tragic is what it is.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.137
And it's the perfect case for you.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.265
Marty, I...

19:02.767 --> 19:05.436
I'm not ready
to go back into the well yet.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.021
It's exactly what you need.

19:07.105 --> 19:10.692
I'm calling the public defender
and telling them we're taking the case.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.278
And I'm putting my best lawyer on it.

19:17.532 --> 19:18.533
What's his name?

19:18.533 --> 19:20.994
Herstadt. Jeffrey Herstadt.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.539
All right, anything else
I need to know about him?

19:24.539 --> 19:25.915
Some mental health issues.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.709
Um, substance abuse?

19:28.710 --> 19:29.544
Probably.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.630
And what are you not telling me?

19:34.007 --> 19:35.049
He confessed.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.055
Okay.

19:41.139 --> 19:46.895
Jeffrey. Have you ever had
any form of psychiatric treatment?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.399
Uh-uh.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.902
Is that no?

19:55.236 --> 19:56.321
No.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.405
Okay.

19:58.948 --> 20:02.160
And Jeffrey. Jeffrey?

20:02.160 --> 20:05.788
Did you tell the detective
that you attacked the doctor?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.505
I wanna go home.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.424
Where's home?

20:19.510 --> 20:20.345
You know.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.560
People versus Jeffrey Herstadt,

20:27.644 --> 20:30.980
charged with one count
Penal Code Section 187-- murder.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.651
Deputy District Attorney Susan Saldano
for the People, Your Honor.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.319
Honey Chandler representing Mr. Herstadt.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.905
Does defense waive
formal reading of the complaint

20:38.905 --> 20:40.490
and enter a plea of not guilty?

20:40.490 --> 20:41.574
No, Your Honor.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.284
But we ask to put over the arraignment

20:43.368 --> 20:46.204
so that the defense
can schedule a psych evaluation.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.539
Can we set a new arraignment date
for 30 days out?

20:50.833 --> 20:52.418
So ordered. Bail?

20:52.502 --> 20:55.046
The People are requesting
a bail deviation, Your Honor.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.423
We are seeking no bail in this case.

20:57.507 --> 20:58.925
The heinous nature of this crime

20:58.925 --> 21:01.511
shows the defendant
to be a threat to the community.

21:01.511 --> 21:04.180
He has no home address
and is a serious flight risk.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.390
We have no objection at this time.

21:06.516 --> 21:07.350
Anything else?

21:07.350 --> 21:09.394
- No, thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.613
- What's this?
- Discovery.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.615
The interrogation.
Your client's confession.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.076
I'll watch it and give you a call.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.244
No need.

21:27.578 --> 21:28.496
I'm sorry?

21:28.496 --> 21:31.290
No plea deal on this case.
There will be a trial.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.251
Congratulations,
you are now the lawyer

21:33.251 --> 21:34.919
for the most hated man in the city.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.632
Bill, what brings you all the way up here?

21:39.716 --> 21:41.050
Thank-you present.

21:41.968 --> 21:42.969
Danielle is over the moon.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.221
Oh, Jesus, that wasn't necessary.
It wasn't hard.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.556
You do a lot of recipe retrieval?

21:46.556 --> 21:48.808
No, this is my first.

21:50.685 --> 21:54.313
If you don't mind me asking,
how's this working out for you?

21:54.397 --> 21:55.273
You miss it?

21:56.899 --> 21:58.234
I miss catching killers.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.111
I don't miss the department bullshit.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.906
I have my cold cases, work those.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.409
I do standard PI stuff.

22:06.409 --> 22:12.081
You know, background checks, surveillance,
sneak and peek, runaway kids.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.958
Beats the shit out of retirement.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.627
I think it's more than that.

22:16.711 --> 22:17.795
Yeah, how so?

22:18.838 --> 22:21.466
Still a mission for you, isn't it?

22:21.466 --> 22:23.676
Everybody counts or nobody counts.

22:25.928 --> 22:26.763
Yeah, you're right.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.099
That hasn't changed.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.060
Quick nip?

22:32.060 --> 22:33.770
Oh, raincheck.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.855
Danielle's making
my mother's Irish stew tonight.

22:35.855 --> 22:36.773
Thanks to you.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.275
Oh. You need a recipe for stew?

22:39.275 --> 22:40.443
Secret ingredient.

22:41.652 --> 22:42.487
Jameson's.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.781
You're still a damn good detective.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.074
Eh...

22:48.159 --> 22:48.993
Sláinte.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.370
Sláinte. Save me some.

22:51.454 --> 22:52.288
You bet.

23:21.651 --> 23:23.027
Mr. Creighton will see you now.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.080
Detective Bosch.

23:34.080 --> 23:34.997
Mr. Creighton.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.668
I don't think we've ever actually met.

23:38.668 --> 23:41.504
You were command staff,
up in the clouds.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.966
I was on the street,
catching bad guys, making cases.

23:44.966 --> 23:47.343
And making a name for yourself.

23:47.343 --> 23:48.636
Well, better late than never.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.638
Someone slipped this under my door.

23:52.348 --> 23:55.184
I needed to reach you.
Your number's unlisted.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.936
It's unusual for a private investigator.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.105
Depend on word of mouth.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.731
Thank you for coming.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.608
Wanted to see how the other half lives.

24:04.193 --> 24:08.197
You should know upfront, I'm not
interested in some corporate security gig.

24:08.281 --> 24:11.617
I'm not offering you one.
Please, sit down.

24:11.701 --> 24:14.829
I'm not staying. I've seen the view.
I have things to do.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.748
We have a client
who wishes to speak with you.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.458
What about?

24:19.542 --> 24:20.793
He won't say.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.379
Give him my number.

24:23.379 --> 24:25.006
Unlisted, remember?

24:25.006 --> 24:26.382
So give me his.

24:26.382 --> 24:29.093
He wants to meet face to face,
at his residence.

24:29.969 --> 24:30.928
Why me?

24:31.012 --> 24:32.263
He's read about you in the papers.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.515
What's his name?

24:35.808 --> 24:36.809
Whitney Vance.

24:36.893 --> 24:40.771
The billionaire.
Advance Engineering.

24:40.855 --> 24:43.149
He'll pay you $10,000
just to have the conversation.

24:44.942 --> 24:48.863
Couple hours out of your day.
Ten K free and clear, no strings.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.698
Just hear him out.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.111
Follow me, please.

25:54.095 --> 25:55.304
You'll get your things back
when you leave.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.237
Mr. Vance. Mr. Bosch is here.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.446
Mr. Bosch.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.199
I would stand and shake your hand,

26:15.283 --> 26:17.994
but I can't stand
and my hand's not steady.

26:18.995 --> 26:19.870
Don't trouble yourself.

26:19.954 --> 26:21.622
Thank you, Sloan. That'll be good.

26:27.295 --> 26:32.049
Before we begin, Mr. Bosch, I need you
to sign a confidentiality agreement.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.678
What I tell you cannot leave this room.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.102
My father gave me that pen.

26:44.103 --> 26:47.982
It's gold from one
of my great-grandfather's mines.

26:47.982 --> 26:51.027
From gold to steel to aviation.

26:52.236 --> 26:54.363
That's how this family made its fortune.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.329
Come join me. On my good ear.

27:08.586 --> 27:12.798
When you don't have much time,
you think of the time behind you.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.509
What can I do for you, Mr. Vance?

27:15.593 --> 27:20.056
I was hoping you could bring an old man
some peace and redemption.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.142
How would I do that?

27:23.142 --> 27:27.772
When I was a young man
in engineering school at USC,

27:27.772 --> 27:31.108
I met a girl who worked
in the college dining hall.

27:31.192 --> 27:33.736
We fell in love.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.488
That was 1952.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.993
And we made plans for a life together.

27:42.745 --> 27:43.579
What happened?

27:43.579 --> 27:44.705
She got pregnant.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.377
And when my father found out,
I didn't stand up for her.

27:49.377 --> 27:51.754
I didn't stand up for myself.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.509
And I have regretted that
every day of my life.

27:58.386 --> 28:00.721
She was Mexican.

28:00.805 --> 28:02.640
Came from a dirt-poor family.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.600
He wasn't having any of that.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.603
Said she was a fortune hunter.

28:07.603 --> 28:12.983
Threatened to disown me,
so I broke it off.

28:13.067 --> 28:15.194
Transferred to another college.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.198
And I never saw her again after that.

28:22.118 --> 28:23.202
You want me to find her?

28:23.202 --> 28:25.996
I want you to find out
what happened to her.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.248
Is she alive?

28:29.041 --> 28:29.959
My child.

28:29.959 --> 28:33.295
Does he or she even exist?

28:33.379 --> 28:36.340
I have no wife,
no children that I know of.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.469
No one to leave this to.

28:44.306 --> 28:48.769
I can't promise you anything, Mr. Vance.
It's almost 70 years ago.

28:48.853 --> 28:53.566
Vibiana Duarte.
She lived on Orchard Avenue, near USC.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.653
The rest of it
that I could recall,

28:57.653 --> 28:59.780
I put in the envelope with the money.

29:05.578 --> 29:08.706
I'll see what I can find out.
I'll get back to you.

29:08.706 --> 29:11.417
To me only, to no one else.

29:11.417 --> 29:17.173
There's billions at stake here
and people will do anything to stop you.

29:19.592 --> 29:20.509
Understood.

29:22.011 --> 29:23.721
Ida, this is Mr. Bosch.

29:23.721 --> 29:26.098
Ida is Mr. Vance's personal secretary.

29:26.182 --> 29:27.141
Nearly 40 years.

29:28.142 --> 29:30.394
Wow, 40 years.

29:30.478 --> 29:31.854
You must know
where the bodies are buried.

29:33.063 --> 29:38.235
Mr. Vance is very ill.
He's more frail than he looks. His heart.

29:38.319 --> 29:40.946
We would hate to see him
taken advantage of in his final days.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.072
In any way.

29:42.156 --> 29:45.910
I only answer to Mr. Vance now.
I'll take my stuff and go.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.703
You'll have to pass back
through the metal detector.

29:47.703 --> 29:51.457
Oh. In case I swiped
Great-grandpa's gold pen?

29:51.457 --> 29:53.417
Visitors often take souvenirs.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.335
I'll bet.

30:08.349 --> 30:09.934
I hate this thing.

30:09.934 --> 30:11.852
It's so fucking heavy
at the end of the day.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.397
Yeah, a royal pain in the ass
when you need to pee.

30:17.107 --> 30:21.028
If men had to deal with this shit,
it would've been solved a long time ago.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.740
How's it going with your new TO?

30:24.740 --> 30:28.160
He's all right. A little too friendly.

30:28.244 --> 30:31.121
Gonna have to break the news to him
that I play for the other team.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.082
Will he take no for an answer?

30:33.082 --> 30:35.668
He better. He gets handsy with me,
he's gonna regret it.

30:38.087 --> 30:38.921
Paulina.

30:38.921 --> 30:40.047
Maddie.

30:40.047 --> 30:41.298
I remember you from the Academy.

30:42.383 --> 30:43.300
We never really spoke.

30:43.384 --> 30:45.427
Yeah, I thought you looked familiar.

30:45.511 --> 30:48.347
So how's it going with you?
How's your TO?

30:48.347 --> 30:51.141
Vasquez? Definite hard-ass.

30:51.225 --> 30:55.062
Hang in there.
I hear she's tough but fair.

30:55.062 --> 30:58.274
And when she trusts you,
she'll even let you drive.

31:02.403 --> 31:03.571
<i>How long you been living there?</i>

31:04.989 --> 31:06.073
<i>I don't know.</i>

31:07.825 --> 31:09.076
<i>Where were you last night?</i>

31:09.076 --> 31:10.995
<i>I don't know. I can't remember.</i>

31:12.037 --> 31:14.540
<i>- You saw Dr. Basu leave the hospital.</i>
- No.

31:14.540 --> 31:19.628
<i>You said that you heard Dr. Basu
talk to your neighbor as he walked by.</i>

31:19.712 --> 31:20.546
<i>I didn't say that.</i>

31:20.546 --> 31:21.839
<i>Then you followed the doctor.</i>

31:29.305 --> 31:30.264
Coltrane!

32:14.475 --> 32:15.309
Fuck me.

32:17.895 --> 32:19.271
Yeah.

32:19.355 --> 32:20.356
Dad, you feel that?

32:20.356 --> 32:21.273
<i>A little.</i>

32:21.357 --> 32:22.191
You?

32:22.191 --> 32:25.152
<i>Yeah. No biggie.
Is anything broken?</i>

32:25.152 --> 32:28.447
Only my train of thought.
How was your day?

32:28.447 --> 32:29.865
<i>Smooth as glass.</i>

32:29.865 --> 32:31.075
New TO?

32:31.075 --> 32:33.869
Yeah, we're getting along
like chicken and waffles.

32:33.869 --> 32:37.498
Are you sure you're okay?
You sound kind of distracted.

32:37.498 --> 32:40.876
I'm fine. I'm fine.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.544
I'm fine.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.252
All right. Thanks, Detective.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.682
Can I help you?

34:18.766 --> 34:21.059
Yes, please.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.061
Trying to get a hold
of a death certificate.

34:23.145 --> 34:25.773
- Name?
- Vibiana Duarte.

34:25.773 --> 34:26.690
When did she die?

34:26.774 --> 34:30.194
I don't know.
I'm not even sure if she is dead.

34:30.194 --> 34:31.153
Date of birth?

34:31.153 --> 34:36.158
I'm guessing probably somewhere
around 1936, '37.

34:36.158 --> 34:37.576
California?

34:37.576 --> 34:39.411
More likely Mexico.

34:39.495 --> 34:41.830
Any other parameters
you can give me here?

34:41.914 --> 34:42.915
Work with me, Detective.

34:42.915 --> 34:45.876
She was alive
and living in Los Angeles in 1952.

34:45.876 --> 34:49.922
Maybe we could start there
and work our way forward. Yeah?

34:49.922 --> 34:52.299
Maybe we could.
I'll be right back.

34:52.299 --> 34:53.217
Thank you.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.888
Catatonic schizophrenia.

34:57.888 --> 34:59.765
And how would this condition
manifest itself

34:59.765 --> 35:02.976
if untreated
in Jeffrey Herstadt's day-to-day life?

35:03.060 --> 35:08.106
Antisocial behavior, fear,
feeling a sense of threat at all times,

35:08.190 --> 35:11.151
the overwhelming urge
to flee stressful situations.

35:11.235 --> 35:12.528
Violence?

35:12.528 --> 35:13.821
Generally, no.

35:13.821 --> 35:16.281
This is a person
who is frightened by the world,

35:16.365 --> 35:17.533
who shuts down under stress.

35:17.533 --> 35:20.577
And would he confess
to a murder he didn't commit?

35:20.702 --> 35:22.996
If he thought
it would end the interrogation

35:23.080 --> 35:25.040
and get him out of that room,

35:25.040 --> 35:28.335
it's my opinion that
he would confess to killing JFK.

35:29.586 --> 35:30.796
Nothing further, Your Honor.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.673
Ms. Saldano.

35:32.673 --> 35:36.009
Dr. Stein, you mentioned
the fight-or-flight syndrome.

35:36.093 --> 35:39.596
Could Mr. Herstadt have chosen to fight?

35:43.475 --> 35:46.311
Aw, you gotta be shitting me.
You red-tagging me?

35:46.395 --> 35:48.230
Sorry, got no choice.

35:48.230 --> 35:51.859
Oh, come on, man, it was barely a quake.
I've lived through thousands of these.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.027
Well, that's exactly what
your neighbor down below is worried about.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.029
- She called you?
- Can you blame her?

35:56.113 --> 35:59.324
Foundation of this house is unstable.
You're hanging by a thread.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.036
You can't live here until the structure
is repaired, or razed and rebuilt.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.496
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.123
Can I at least go in
and get some of my shit?

36:06.123 --> 36:07.291
Of course.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.585
But find someplace else to stay tonight.

36:09.585 --> 36:11.336
And don't take the tag off.

36:20.929 --> 36:24.516
<i>6 Adam 79,
domestic violence suspect there now,</i>

36:24.600 --> 36:28.228
<i>873 North Harvard Boulevard, Room 3,
at the Harvard House Motel.</i>

36:28.312 --> 36:30.522
I know that address.
Couple of frequent flyers.

36:30.606 --> 36:33.108
Tell Dispatch we're responding.

36:33.108 --> 36:36.069
Adam 79, roger. Show us responding.

36:36.153 --> 36:38.447
Ever been in a fight?

36:38.447 --> 36:40.949
I mean, a real physical confrontation.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.451
A knock-down, drag-out brawl.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.414
Once in the eighth grade,
this girl made a really racist remark

36:47.414 --> 36:49.583
about my stepfather,
and I hauled off and clocked her.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.794
But no, not really.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.633
- Call for backup.
- You really think we need it?

36:57.633 --> 36:59.134
No, they won't get here in time.

36:59.134 --> 37:01.637
Just in case there's
a use of force investigation.

37:01.637 --> 37:06.266
6 Adam 79,
requesting backup at our location.

37:06.350 --> 37:08.477
All right, partner,
let's see who's who in the zoo.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.354
- Announce and pounce.
- Okay.

37:13.065 --> 37:14.524
LAPD!

37:19.738 --> 37:21.782
Stop resisting! Turn around!

37:21.782 --> 37:23.158
Watch your six, boot!

37:34.044 --> 37:37.714
Turn around!
Put your hands behind your back!

37:40.175 --> 37:41.385
Not bad, boot.

37:41.385 --> 37:42.803
Fucking A.

37:42.803 --> 37:43.971
But I told you to watch your six.

37:46.390 --> 37:47.599
Let's go.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.603
Can you believe this shit?
LA bureaucracy.

37:51.687 --> 37:53.105
What are you gonna do?

37:53.105 --> 37:56.817
Move in to my office.
Shower at the Athletic Club next door.

37:56.817 --> 37:58.610
Oh. Can it be fixed?

37:58.694 --> 38:00.946
Well, if the city doesn't condemn it.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.365
And do you have earthquake insurance?

38:03.365 --> 38:06.284
Good question.
I may have let it lapse.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.579
Any word on a Rogers retrial?

38:09.663 --> 38:12.124
I haven't given up hope.

38:12.124 --> 38:13.250
But that's not why I'm here.

38:13.250 --> 38:14.960
Okay, so why are you here?

38:14.960 --> 38:17.212
We've taken on the Jeffrey Herstadt case.

38:17.212 --> 38:18.797
The guy who killed the doctor?

38:18.797 --> 38:19.715
Allegedly.

38:19.715 --> 38:20.966
Thought he confessed.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.385
I think the confession was coerced.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.095
I filed a motion to suppress it.

38:25.095 --> 38:26.430
Good luck with that.

38:26.430 --> 38:27.723
You don't believe that can happen?

38:27.723 --> 38:29.641
Of course it happens.

38:29.725 --> 38:32.144
Not as often
as defense attorneys like to claim.

38:34.146 --> 38:35.605
What does this have to do with me?

38:37.816 --> 38:41.028
I would like you to testify
as an expert witness

38:41.028 --> 38:43.030
on police interrogation techniques.

38:43.030 --> 38:44.239
I don't work for the Dark Side.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.450
Even in pursuit of the truth?

38:46.450 --> 38:48.910
Have you even read
the Constitution, Bosch?

38:48.994 --> 38:51.329
We're an integral part
of the justice system.

38:51.413 --> 38:53.498
You're what's wrong
with the justice system.

38:53.582 --> 38:55.584
Sorry, not you personally.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.171
Well, sometimes.

38:59.171 --> 39:00.797
- If you change your mind...
- I won't.

39:00.881 --> 39:03.341
...the interrogation is on the disc.

39:11.475 --> 39:13.602
<i>What did you find out, Mr. Bosch?</i>

39:13.602 --> 39:18.273
Well, as you suspected,
Vibiana Duarte is deceased.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.274
Of course.

39:22.152 --> 39:23.862
I've always known it.

39:25.447 --> 39:26.281
When?

39:26.281 --> 39:28.283
1953.

39:28.283 --> 39:31.036
I have a copy of her death certificate
here if you'd like to see it.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.746
That's a long time ago.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.373
How did she die?

39:36.958 --> 39:37.793
Suicide.

39:37.918 --> 39:39.753
Oh, God.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.674
How?

39:46.551 --> 39:47.719
Doesn't say.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.305
Well, I think that finishes us,
Mr. Bosch.

39:50.305 --> 39:54.309
Send me a bill
for services rendered.

39:54.309 --> 39:57.479
Vibiana died eight months
after the last time you saw her.

39:58.939 --> 39:59.856
She could have had the child.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.233
Wouldn't there be a birth certificate?

40:01.233 --> 40:03.527
Might be under another name.

40:03.527 --> 40:05.821
Baby could have been adopted.

40:05.821 --> 40:08.448
Maybe raised in the foster care system.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.201
Maybe she lost it.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.121
Maybe.

40:17.249 --> 40:18.458
I'd like to keep looking.

40:18.542 --> 40:19.751
Why?

40:21.253 --> 40:22.838
You may have an heir.

40:22.838 --> 40:24.589
It's the reason you hired me, isn't it?

40:24.673 --> 40:26.883
Are you trying to take me
for a ride, Mr. Bosch?

40:26.967 --> 40:29.469
An expensive wild goose chase?

40:29.553 --> 40:30.679
No, sir.

40:30.679 --> 40:33.557
The money you've already paid me
is more than sufficient.

40:33.557 --> 40:34.808
Then why?

40:36.560 --> 40:37.602
I know how it feels.

40:38.770 --> 40:39.604
Know how what feels?

40:39.688 --> 40:42.816
Mr. Vance, I'd like to try
and find her child.

40:42.816 --> 40:43.984
Your child.

40:43.984 --> 40:45.110
If I can.

40:46.820 --> 40:49.322
Well, please hurry, Mr. Bosch.
I don't have much time.

41:06.715 --> 41:08.383
I thought you said nothing broke.

41:08.383 --> 41:09.467
Nothing important.

41:10.719 --> 41:11.720
What the hell happened to you?

41:11.720 --> 41:13.305
Jesus Christ.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.974
We need to get you out of here
before this place slides down the hill.

41:16.850 --> 41:17.684
Have you watched this?

41:17.684 --> 41:21.271
I don't work for defense attorneys.
That shiner? It's gonna be a doozy.

41:21.271 --> 41:24.816
Yeah, DV call.
Wife sucker-punched me.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.568
It was my fault. I turned my back.

41:26.568 --> 41:27.944
You hurt?

41:28.028 --> 41:30.322
Actually, it was kind of fun.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.742
Can you make an exception?

41:35.202 --> 41:36.036
For me?

41:37.662 --> 41:43.043
Honey defended you in court
and after Mom died, she was there for me.

41:44.586 --> 41:47.339
This is a big moment for her.

41:47.339 --> 41:49.716
Her first time back in court.

41:49.716 --> 41:52.969
Please, just watch the disc, Dad.

41:54.804 --> 41:58.099
This is the last time you get
to play the daughter card with me.

41:58.975 --> 42:00.018
Well, we both know that's not true.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.728
Put some ice on the eye.

42:43.687 --> 42:44.688
Harry.

42:44.688 --> 42:47.023
Hey, Michelle. You still here?

42:47.107 --> 42:49.025
Few more days.

42:49.109 --> 42:51.653
Thought I'd stay and see
Honey strut her stuff in court.

42:51.653 --> 42:54.864
- She in?
- Mama, it's Harry.

42:56.032 --> 42:57.325
- Goodnight, Harry.
- Night.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.785
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.041
Never use my daughter to get to me again.

43:06.459 --> 43:07.794
I'm sorry.

43:07.794 --> 43:11.715
She offered,
but I shouldn't have taken her up on it.

43:11.715 --> 43:14.301
Thanks for getting this back to me.

43:14.301 --> 43:17.053
It's a cooked confession.
I can show you.

43:19.681 --> 43:23.059
I gotta say, I can't believe
you're still living in this house.

43:23.143 --> 43:24.144
Somebody tried to kill you here.

43:24.144 --> 43:25.770
Well, somebody tried to kill you
in your house.

43:25.854 --> 43:27.522
I only got shot at. You got shot.

43:27.522 --> 43:29.816
This is my fucking house.

43:29.816 --> 43:32.736
I'm not gonna let those motherfuckers
chase me out of my own home.

43:32.736 --> 43:33.653
Fuck them.

43:33.737 --> 43:35.905
Okay.

43:35.989 --> 43:37.073
Cocksuckers.

43:42.078 --> 43:43.913
Now, Detective,
at this point in the video,

43:43.997 --> 43:47.709
how would you assess the technique
Detective Gustafson is using?

43:47.709 --> 43:51.838
He's got a downward angle on the suspect
and he's showing him his gun.

43:51.838 --> 43:56.885
This conduct communicates to a suspect
that he's helpless and hopeless.

43:56.885 --> 43:58.470
You were a detective
for more than two decades.

43:58.470 --> 44:00.472
Isn't that how you want
a suspect to feel?

44:00.472 --> 44:02.390
You want a suspect to talk to you.

44:02.474 --> 44:05.018
A conversation.
Both parties on the same level.

44:05.018 --> 44:07.312
You don't hover over him with a gun.

44:07.312 --> 44:09.564
You mentioned physical intimidation.

44:09.564 --> 44:12.650
Let's talk about verbal intimidation.

44:12.734 --> 44:15.779
<i>You just told me that you did.
Which is it, Jeffrey?</i>

44:15.779 --> 44:19.741
<i>I-I was. I was there. I-I saw him.</i>

44:19.741 --> 44:21.576
<i>I-I saw him.</i>

44:21.576 --> 44:23.244
<i>You saw who? You saw the doctor?</i>

44:23.328 --> 44:24.996
<i>Of course you saw the doctor.
You stabbed him.</i>

44:25.080 --> 44:26.247
<i>No, sir, I didn't.</i>

44:26.331 --> 44:27.582
<i>What did you do with the knife?</i>

44:27.582 --> 44:30.585
<i>I... I don't know. Can I go?</i>

44:30.585 --> 44:34.923
<i>No. No, no. Not until I hear the truth.
Tell me why you did it.</i>

44:34.923 --> 44:36.591
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

44:36.591 --> 44:38.593
<i>Yeah, you didn't mean to what?</i>

44:38.593 --> 44:40.929
<i>You didn't mean to what?
Work with me here, Jeffrey.</i>

44:40.929 --> 44:42.430
<i>You didn't mean to what?</i>

44:42.514 --> 44:44.766
<i>I didn't... I didn't...
I didn't want to, but...</i>

44:44.766 --> 44:48.061
<i>You didn't. You didn't want to,
but what? But what, Jeffrey?</i>

44:51.106 --> 44:52.190
<i>But I had to.</i>

44:52.190 --> 44:54.984
<i>You had to. You had to stab him.</i>

44:55.193 --> 44:56.069
<i>Can I go now?</i>

44:56.069 --> 45:00.532
<i>Oh, no, no.
I need to hear you say it.</i>

45:04.119 --> 45:05.620
<i>I stabbed him.</i>

45:07.122 --> 45:08.415
Detective Bosch.

45:09.624 --> 45:13.670
Did Jeffrey Herstadt just confess
to stabbing Dr. Basu and murdering him?

45:13.670 --> 45:14.671
Yes.

45:14.671 --> 45:16.339
And did you believe him,
based on this video?

45:16.423 --> 45:18.591
I do not believe the confession, no.

45:19.717 --> 45:20.718
He said he did it.

45:20.802 --> 45:23.805
He said what he thought he needed
to say to get out of that room.

45:23.805 --> 45:26.474
Based on your training and experience,

45:26.558 --> 45:28.810
would you call what you've just seen
a cooked confession?

45:28.810 --> 45:29.894
Yes.

45:31.187 --> 45:33.356
One hundred percent.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.358
And in your expert opinion,

45:35.442 --> 45:38.528
what is a proper interrogation
supposed to be?

45:38.528 --> 45:40.488
A search for the truth.

45:42.282 --> 45:44.826
Based on the totality
of the circumstances,

45:44.826 --> 45:47.704
including the coercive tactics
used by the detective,

45:47.704 --> 45:51.958
the court finds that
the defendant's statement was involuntary.

45:51.958 --> 45:56.045
Therefore, the video of the confession
will not be allowed at trial.

45:56.129 --> 46:00.300
The defense motion to suppress
the defendant's confession is granted.

46:00.300 --> 46:03.261
The court will be in recess
for 15 minutes.

46:04.554 --> 46:05.388
It's good news.

46:10.268 --> 46:11.561
When are you gonna drop the charges?

46:11.561 --> 46:14.230
Despite the judge's ruling,
we will be proceeding to trial

46:14.314 --> 46:16.900
and we will convict Mr. Herstadt
of the crime he committed.

46:16.900 --> 46:19.068
Susan, come on.
No confession, no case.

46:21.196 --> 46:23.031
- What's this?
- More discovery. Lab results.

46:23.031 --> 46:25.450
- When did you get these?
- Just got them.

46:27.410 --> 46:29.787
Okay, what am I looking at?

46:29.871 --> 46:32.373
DNA evidence
that links Herstadt to the victim.

46:33.917 --> 46:36.836
DNA. Beautiful.

46:37.837 --> 46:39.464
- Did you know?
- No idea. I swear.

46:39.464 --> 46:42.884
- If you're playing me--
- Harry. I don't know anything about this.

46:42.884 --> 46:47.555
She literally just sprang it on me. Okay?
Listen to me, I'm as surprised as you are.

46:49.265 --> 46:50.183
Fuck!

47:21.214 --> 47:22.048
<i>Good evening.</i>

47:22.048 --> 47:22.966
Here we go.

47:22.966 --> 47:27.971
<i>After intense internal discussions
and analysis of the mistrial,</i>

47:27.971 --> 47:29.764
<i>and much soul-searching,</i>

47:29.764 --> 47:31.975
<i>the Office of the District Attorney
has concluded</i>

47:31.975 --> 47:33.768
<i>that there is not sufficient evidence</i>

47:33.768 --> 47:35.144
<i>to prove the case
beyond a reasonable doubt...</i>

47:35.228 --> 47:36.062
Shit.

47:36.062 --> 47:38.064
<i>...and that a retrial
would yield the same result.</i>

47:38.064 --> 47:40.817
<i>We will not be retrying Carl Rogers.</i>

47:40.817 --> 47:42.318
God damn it.

47:42.402 --> 47:44.445
Mama, I am so, so sorry.

47:44.529 --> 47:46.781
<i>Carl Rogers
was released from custody earlier.</i>

47:46.781 --> 47:48.658
<i>Our camera was there
as he appeared back in public</i>

47:48.658 --> 47:50.618
<i>for the first time since his arrest.</i>

47:53.246 --> 47:55.373
<i>-The system worked for once.
-</i> <i>Sir.</i>

47:55.373 --> 47:57.542
<i>Now, in other news, in Mid-City...</i>

47:57.542 --> 48:01.754
They have to retry him.
Fucking fucker hired someone to kill me.

48:01.838 --> 48:03.089
It's outrageous.

48:03.089 --> 48:04.007
I haven't forgotten.

48:05.508 --> 48:06.426
Unbelievable.

48:06.426 --> 48:08.595
Way of the world.

48:08.595 --> 48:09.596
So it goes.

48:15.935 --> 48:16.853
All right, Dad.

48:16.853 --> 48:19.147
I think you're set
with sugar, fat, and sodium.

48:20.857 --> 48:22.066
Three major food groups.

48:23.901 --> 48:24.736
You taking your microwave?

48:24.736 --> 48:26.070
Wasn't planning to.

48:26.154 --> 48:27.238
You don't know how long
you'll be out of the house.

48:27.322 --> 48:28.656
Not that long.

48:35.997 --> 48:38.333
I am so sorry.

48:38.333 --> 48:40.126
It's not over yet.

48:41.836 --> 48:42.962
Jesus, what happened to you?

48:43.046 --> 48:44.255
Oh, it's just work.

48:44.339 --> 48:47.175
I, uh, I need to talk to your dad.

48:53.306 --> 48:54.182
See the news?

48:55.850 --> 48:57.268
Justice denied.

48:59.562 --> 49:00.480
You had a couple cocktails?

49:00.480 --> 49:03.983
Michelle drove.
She's waiting in the car.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.613
We have to nail this guy, Harry.

49:08.613 --> 49:09.739
Yeah, we do.

49:11.783 --> 49:13.451
But we do it my way this time.

49:13.451 --> 49:14.494
Your way.

49:14.494 --> 49:16.829
Yeah. Your way didn't work.

49:16.913 --> 49:17.830
No.

49:19.457 --> 49:20.833
No, it didn't.

49:20.917 --> 49:23.211
Courts, justice system.

49:23.211 --> 49:25.672
Due process.

49:26.798 --> 49:28.800
Fucker's free as a bird.

49:36.182 --> 49:37.016
Okay.

49:39.519 --> 49:40.353
Your way.

50:16.681 --> 50:18.641
Mr. Vance. It's late.

50:20.309 --> 50:21.894
You should be in bed.

50:21.978 --> 50:23.855
I'll tell the nurse. Mr. Vance.

50:27.066 --> 50:27.942
Mr. Vance?

50:31.154 --> 50:31.988
Oh, my God.

50:40.496 --> 50:42.665
<i>This season on</i> Bosch: Legacy.

50:42.749 --> 50:46.544
I wonder if I had stood up
to my father all those years ago.

50:46.544 --> 50:47.670
The path not taken.

50:47.795 --> 50:50.465
Tell me, Mr. Bosch,
were you close to your father?

50:50.465 --> 50:51.924
I never knew my father.

50:54.051 --> 50:54.886
Are you sleeping?

50:54.886 --> 50:55.845
<i>Not great.</i>

50:55.845 --> 50:56.971
<i>And work?</i>

50:56.971 --> 50:59.390
<i>Work keeps my mind
off other things.</i>

50:59.474 --> 51:00.391
<i>Like what?</i>

51:01.934 --> 51:03.853
Carl Rogers, you've been served.

51:03.853 --> 51:07.940
I went out early
to run some errands. I got home.

51:08.024 --> 51:10.276
He was in the bedroom waiting for me.

51:10.276 --> 51:11.569
You think he's gonna do it again?

51:11.569 --> 51:13.488
Let it go.
Now it's somebody else's job.

51:13.488 --> 51:14.655
<i>I know, but--</i>

51:14.739 --> 51:17.533
Look, they got their job
and we got ours. Feel me?

51:17.617 --> 51:20.161
I worry about you out on
the mean streets of East Hollywood.

51:20.161 --> 51:21.287
They can be.

51:21.287 --> 51:25.500
<i>Rogers had some
really unsavory actors in the mix.</i>

51:25.500 --> 51:27.752
Bratva royalty.
Not to be trifled with.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.837
<i>Our Stoli friend wants to meet.</i>

51:29.921 --> 51:31.589
<i>They ain't dealing with no bank.</i>

51:31.589 --> 51:33.549
This sounded urgent
and Rogers sounded concerned.

51:33.633 --> 51:35.092
We'll get you your money.

51:35.176 --> 51:36.260
Hey!

51:41.641 --> 51:44.852
<i>What I really want,
what I think about all the time,</i>

51:44.936 --> 51:47.104
is to hunt him down and end him.

51:48.815 --> 51:51.025
I told you about that rape call
we got a couple weeks ago.

51:51.025 --> 51:52.276
Yeah, and?

51:52.360 --> 51:53.736
<i>I just can't let it go.</i>

51:53.820 --> 51:55.196
<i>At the end of the day,
you have to decide</i>

51:55.196 --> 51:56.572
what kind of a cop
you wanna be.

51:58.324 --> 52:00.993
An heir has a board seat,
controlling interest of the company.

52:01.077 --> 52:03.412
- There is no heir.
- What if this detective digs one up?

52:03.496 --> 52:04.455
My people are on Bosch.

52:04.539 --> 52:06.666
Something ain't kosher in Denmark.

52:06.666 --> 52:08.251
This is just the beginning.

52:16.592 --> 52:18.761
Billions of dollars on the line.

52:18.845 --> 52:20.596
<i>People will do anything
to get their hands on it.</i>

52:20.680 --> 52:22.932
<i></i> <i>-</i> Hands up! Now!
