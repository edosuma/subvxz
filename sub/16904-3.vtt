WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:03.377
Look at this.

00:04.421 --> 00:05.880
The writers put it on my door.

00:06.048 --> 00:08.048
I don't know
what that's referring to.

00:08.217 --> 00:11.135
It's referring to this one time
that I got a chemical peel before work,

00:11.260 --> 00:13.804
and I was wearing a red
and green sweater and a fedora.

00:14.293 --> 00:15.139
But these

00:15.307 --> 00:17.391
douche-bs
have been doing this for weeks.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.268
"Lez Lemon."

00:19.436 --> 00:21.479
- First thought.
- "Winona Ryder in a hundred years."

00:21.647 --> 00:23.230
- Weak.
- "Fart Barfunkel."

00:23.398 --> 00:24.815
- Indian food.
- "Paul Simon."

00:25.196 --> 00:26.859
I don't get that, but it hurts.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.633
I love a good joke, but I am their boss,
and, at a certain point,

00:30.758 --> 00:31.906
it crosses a line.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.808
To quote Rodney Dangerfield,

00:33.933 --> 00:35.170
"Hey, I... "

00:37.884 --> 00:39.205
If you're about to say

00:39.373 --> 00:41.290
that you don't get any respect,
you're right.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.552
I mean, in a post-apocalyptic world,

00:43.677 --> 00:45.503
how would society even use you?

00:45.671 --> 00:46.879
Traveling bard.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.172
Radiation canary.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.862
I have to run.
I have an appointment in Washington.

00:52.083 --> 00:54.948
The hearings on the Kabletown-NBC deal
are underway,

00:55.381 --> 00:57.316
and the company has entrusted me

00:57.721 --> 00:59.062
to be their front man.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.644
Will you ask congress
where they put the USA network?

01:01.769 --> 01:04.146
I've been trying to find monk for,
like, three months.

01:04.313 --> 01:07.157
The only thing I will be discussing
with the house subcommittee on baseball,

01:07.282 --> 01:10.069
quiz shows, terrorism,
and media is vertical integration.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.746
What's vertical integration?

01:11.871 --> 01:14.778
Imagine that your favorite
corn chip manufacturer also owned

01:14.903 --> 01:16.617
the number one diarrhea medication.

01:16.785 --> 01:17.800
That'd be great,

01:17.925 --> 01:20.413
they could put a little sample
of the medicine in each bag.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.914
Keep thinking.

01:22.285 --> 01:25.918
Except then they might be tempted
to make the corn chips give you...

01:26.086 --> 01:28.838
- Vertical integration.
- That should not be allowed to happen.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.756
It's my job to make sure
it does happen.

01:31.318 --> 01:34.183
Do you know who gets elected
to congress these days?

01:34.399 --> 01:35.386
Former athletes,

01:35.554 --> 01:37.972
washed-up actors, and women.

01:38.338 --> 01:41.642
I'm locked and loaded and ready
for whatever these beltway throw at me.

01:41.940 --> 01:44.815
If we have to stay and there aren't
enough rooms, we have to share a room,

01:44.940 --> 01:47.565
I forgot to bring a shirt to sleep in
and the stores are all closed...

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:05.690 --> 02:08.079
Liz, quick question
about the Johnny Appleseed sketch.

02:08.204 --> 02:10.545
Does it hurt it
if we can't call him Johnny Appleseed?

02:10.714 --> 02:11.723
Yes. Why?

02:12.090 --> 02:14.759
Appleseed was a real guy,
and his descendants are very litigious.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.845
So here is a list of the names
that legal says we can use.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.472
Jerry Bananaseed.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.045
- And nothing else.
- So what are my choices?

02:22.170 --> 02:24.986
Either I argue with legal or I spend
all day writing something else?

02:25.111 --> 02:28.147
- Does anyone care how hard I work...
- We can't use Jerry Bananaseed.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.483
Someone with that name
killed a bunch of nurses.

02:34.711 --> 02:36.405
Kenneth.
You're back.

02:37.392 --> 02:39.976
I need you to get me
something called vagitrax.

02:40.233 --> 02:42.661
It's for dry knees.

02:42.969 --> 02:45.001
I wish I were back, miss Maroney.

02:45.126 --> 02:46.982
I'm reapplying to the page program.

02:47.107 --> 02:49.293
But it's a lot harder
than my first time around.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.604
It's gotten really competitive.

02:51.929 --> 02:54.757
You shoulda seen what I saw
in Mr. Winerslav's office.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.343
Your interview will be Thursday.

02:57.671 --> 02:59.678
Is there any a/v equipment
you'll be needing?

02:59.846 --> 03:01.013
Equipment?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.890
<i>Inside Schwartz 21</i>

03:03.058 --> 03:04.517
<i>Hill street blues, wings is fun</i>

03:04.685 --> 03:07.937
<i>Golden girls, quantum leap
outsourced is the new friends</i>

03:08.686 --> 03:11.303
The process used to be dignified.

03:11.572 --> 03:13.192
Now it's just a pageant.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.985
Just a pageant?

03:15.153 --> 03:18.739
That's like saying a guy is cool
because he has just a speedboat.

03:19.318 --> 03:22.827
If you need help winning a pageant,
you've come to the right place.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.162
If it'll get me back
into the page program.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.050
When I was pageantizing,

03:27.175 --> 03:30.417
my mother told me there's three things
standing between you and winning:

03:30.745 --> 03:33.003
Your breasts
and wanting it bad enough.

03:33.891 --> 03:35.653
I'm not sure that applies...

03:36.675 --> 03:38.717
We've already started.

03:39.483 --> 03:40.427
And this deal

03:40.595 --> 03:42.726
will count as a 39%

03:43.015 --> 03:46.100
bump variable
against an 11% increase

03:46.268 --> 03:48.239
- of synchronized flexibility.
- Sir,

03:48.645 --> 03:50.120
my name is Rob Reiner.

03:50.245 --> 03:52.552
And before I became a congressman,

03:52.768 --> 03:55.317
I dabbled in television,
won a couple of emmys.

03:55.704 --> 03:58.904
And I believe that my experience
out there in Hollyweird

03:59.469 --> 04:03.329
gives me a special insight
into these types of deals,

04:03.837 --> 04:05.772
particularly when it comes to...

04:06.121 --> 04:08.706
- Say it, meathead.
- Vertical integration.

04:10.148 --> 04:11.667
The dreaded V.I.

04:12.170 --> 04:15.588
Bad for america, kills innovation,
drives up prices.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.755
Is that it?

04:17.132 --> 04:20.134
I guess that's why big oil and Microsoft
are such great American failures.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.719
- What?
- Dare I say

04:21.887 --> 04:25.345
vertical integration drives down prices
by streamlining

04:25.470 --> 04:27.224
the process.
Consider the farmer.

04:27.782 --> 04:31.103
He owns his land, the equipment he uses
to harvest his crops,

04:31.271 --> 04:33.397
the truck that he uses
to drive that product

04:33.565 --> 04:36.650
to the farmer's market where he sells it
directly to the consumer.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.944
Is that not vertical integration?

04:40.614 --> 04:41.739
1:32 p.m.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.925
Mark the time, ladies and gentlemen,

04:44.260 --> 04:46.098
that congress put a bullet

04:46.476 --> 04:48.120
in the head of the American farmer.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.204
No! You win!

04:49.372 --> 04:50.629
The acclaimed director

04:50.754 --> 04:53.292
of <i>when Harry met Sally</i>
would never do that.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.288
As always, it's been a pleasure.

04:55.883 --> 04:58.047
Mr. Donaghy, one last question.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.311
Why is NBC so racist?

05:07.062 --> 05:09.391
Horrible.
What else can you do?

05:09.668 --> 05:13.224
<i>Oh, everybody born
before Jesus is in hell</i>

05:13.349 --> 05:14.939
- they went straight...
- Enough.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.929
I'm gonna have to reinvent you.
Break you down completely

05:18.054 --> 05:19.853
and build you up from scratch.

05:19.978 --> 05:21.946
Just like Mickey Rourke
did me to sexually.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.616
But miss Maroney,
I don't want to be reinvented.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.866
I want to be me.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.952
All right, first things first.

05:28.593 --> 05:30.162
Can you lose that goony accent?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.707
I don't know, ma'am.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.414
You made me think about it,

05:33.539 --> 05:36.251
and when I get to thinkin' 'bout it,
it juh get worse.

05:38.638 --> 05:42.007
I represent Rhodes Island's
first congressional district.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.425
It's a diverse community,

05:43.593 --> 05:46.930
from the hard-working moms
and dads of Smithfield

05:47.293 --> 05:48.889
to those spoiled jags at brown

05:50.308 --> 05:53.394
to a thriving, flourishing Italian
criminal community in Providence.

05:53.941 --> 05:55.729
It's my responsibility to make sure

05:56.135 --> 05:59.725
that public airwaves
represent the face of my public.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.610
Now, one question,

06:01.778 --> 06:04.516
why is it that NBC looks
about as diverse

06:04.641 --> 06:05.864
as a Wilco concert?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.825
I would point to

06:07.993 --> 06:09.332
Sunday night football,

06:09.457 --> 06:11.996
which features many black players
and coaches.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.250
And we have Anthony Anderson,
the star of <i>law & order</i>,

06:16.418 --> 06:18.460
which is entering its <i>21st</i>...

06:19.605 --> 06:21.821
Why did we cancel that?
That doesn't make any sense.

06:21.946 --> 06:24.133
Mr. Donaghy, this may just be
about money to you,

06:24.301 --> 06:26.927
but, as a member of congress
and a black woman...

06:27.095 --> 06:29.888
I don't really see color or gender,
Mr. Chang.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.560
I feel I have an extra duty,

06:31.685 --> 06:33.738
not just to my constituents,

06:34.343 --> 06:36.176
but to future generations.

06:36.301 --> 06:37.062
Now,

06:37.230 --> 06:41.211
unless I see some serious change
at NBC and soon,

06:41.577 --> 06:45.362
I can guarantee you this deal
will not happen.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.950
Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb.
Peas and carrots.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.202
Rhubarb. Rhubarb.
Peas and carrots. Rhubarb.

06:55.102 --> 06:58.000
Dotcom, you run
Tracy's production company, right?

06:58.168 --> 06:59.585
Yes. Dotcom productions.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.712
That's Tracy Jordan
spelled backwards.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.078
I need programming
for the African-American community,

07:05.203 --> 07:07.801
and nobody knows
that demographic better than you.

07:08.119 --> 07:10.471
Don't worry about it, Jackie D,
I'm on it.

07:10.778 --> 07:14.099
Call Grizz. I need someone around
who's not just a yes man.

07:14.456 --> 07:16.143
Whatever you say, Tray.

07:16.543 --> 07:17.970
Come on, Walter.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.857
What is going on?

07:22.025 --> 07:24.578
Representative Regina Bookman
is using the Kabletown hearings

07:24.703 --> 07:25.903
as a soap box

07:26.071 --> 07:28.363
from which to complain
about a lack of diversity on TV.

07:28.654 --> 07:30.157
Well, she has a point.

07:30.282 --> 07:33.660
I was reading the new Malcolm Gladwell
<i>New Yorker</i> piece on my kindle.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.457
- Did you really read that?
- No.

07:35.582 --> 07:37.996
I really resent
the congresswoman's accusations.

07:38.121 --> 07:40.459
I've long been
an advocate for diversity.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.642
It's made this nation great.
The Chinese built the railroads,

07:43.767 --> 07:46.298
the Irish built
and then filled the jails...

07:46.466 --> 07:48.175
A guy named Juan built my <i>armoire</i>.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.708
Diversity means new ideas
and new markets.

07:50.833 --> 07:54.139
It is our best hope
for true innovation.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.100
Did you tell all that to Bookman?

07:56.268 --> 07:59.186
I was too busy trying to remember
the name of the black kid on community.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.438
- D'nall glover.
- It wouldn't have mattered anyway.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.256
The thing was just political theater.
You should have seen

08:04.381 --> 08:05.526
her grandstanding.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.077
The future and america.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.032
Now I may have lost my train
of thought several minutes ago,

08:12.292 --> 08:14.909
but if I continue to talk like this,

08:15.034 --> 08:17.079
no one will notice, and when I stop,

08:17.667 --> 08:20.874
you will applaud my energy.
Thank you.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.383
I can't let Bookman <i> jeopardize</i>
this deal.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.426
Tell me about diversity at TGS.

08:32.034 --> 08:33.688
Well, Lutz claims to be Inuit.

08:33.813 --> 08:36.849
At least that was his explanation
when I found his poem about snow.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.558
And Toofer?
Is he any good?

08:38.727 --> 08:41.270
I mentioned this to you 100 times,
but he went to Harvard.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.063
So we know he's smart and superb
at masturbation.

08:45.896 --> 08:48.694
Is there any way we can give him
a promotion of some kind?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.605
Sure.
Make him co-head writer.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.157
I always figured he'd take over for me
when I die at my desk.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.449
Really?

08:54.617 --> 08:58.078
Yeah. Let someone else
share the total lack of respect,

08:58.246 --> 09:01.915
deal with the meetings, the complaining,
the stupid Johnny Appleseed sketch.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.961
You are not doing a sketch
on the Appleseed family.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.922
Monty Appleseed and I share
a liquor locker at the opera.

09:10.693 --> 09:12.879
I forgot my doctor said
no more frustrated noises,

09:13.004 --> 09:14.771
'cause it makes my vocal cords go...

09:16.973 --> 09:18.849
Now it's gonna be like this all day.

09:21.387 --> 09:22.922
There you are.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.938
I've got hair extensions for you

09:25.106 --> 09:27.399
and a body shaper
with a reinforced penile sleeve.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.736
Miss maroney, please.
My feet are killing me.

09:31.089 --> 09:32.905
I am trying to help you, Kenneth.

09:33.073 --> 09:33.948
Believe me,

09:34.073 --> 09:37.034
I wish you weren't such
a Houston foreclosure of a human being,

09:37.202 --> 09:38.619
but I need to tear you down

09:38.787 --> 09:41.413
and turn you into someone
that can actually win this thing.

09:45.463 --> 09:47.419
They hired keyboard guy?

09:50.511 --> 09:53.203
He's not even recycling properly.

09:53.910 --> 09:55.302
Miss Maroney, wait.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.572
So what do we want to see on TV?

09:59.947 --> 10:01.725
I personally love cop shows.

10:02.129 --> 10:04.979
I can't wait for law & order
to start back up.

10:06.637 --> 10:08.637
Why?
It was a tentpole!

10:08.762 --> 10:10.513
A tentpole!

10:11.069 --> 10:14.642
Here's something I've been working on.
It's called <i>Let's stay together</i>.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.326
After the Al Green song.

10:16.451 --> 10:19.952
It focuses on an African-American
family in Detroit in the '70s.

10:20.202 --> 10:23.371
Motown, the auto industry,
Vietnam, Watergate.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.504
<i>Let's stay together</i>
is not just about a family

10:25.629 --> 10:28.190
trying to stay together,
but also a nation.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.545
- What if there was a talking dog?
- I'd like to see that

10:30.713 --> 10:32.381
incorporated into your rewrite.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.950
Meeting over.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.458
<i>Thank you, NBC</i>

10:38.583 --> 10:41.459
<i>For all the laughs and tears</i>

10:41.584 --> 10:44.226
<i>Once home to Kelsey Grammer</i>

10:44.394 --> 10:46.687
<i>The golden girls,</i> My name is Earl
The A-Team <i>and cheers</i>

10:46.958 --> 10:48.522
<i>So shine on</i>

10:48.690 --> 10:52.125
<i>And thank you NBC</i>

10:52.250 --> 10:53.360
A top-ten network.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.408
Smile.

10:58.516 --> 11:00.513
Let's dig in, cohorts.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.545
It means the badger in Spanish.

11:15.910 --> 11:17.504
I'm not sure who did it.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.098
Toofer's a head writer sign
on his door.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.850
It's great.
Good for him.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.352
Oh, God. <i>Tejon</i> face.
Is this about the TV interview?

11:27.609 --> 11:29.062
What TV interview?

11:29.359 --> 11:31.522
It's nothing.
It's just a local cable show.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.775
If my co-head writer
is being interviewed, then so am I.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.571
<i>Aqui viene el tejon!</i>

11:39.413 --> 11:42.347
The only thing that worked
in the read-through was the dog.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.491
- How's production going, Tray?
- Good. And there's a lot of buzz.

11:46.616 --> 11:49.166
Can you hear it too?
Or is my tinnitus acting up?

11:51.053 --> 11:53.798
That food
is for Dotcom productions only.

11:53.923 --> 11:56.005
TGS's food is backstage.

11:56.176 --> 11:59.842
But they don't have women's sports bars.
Men can have cramping too, you know.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.804
Mr. Donaghy, I have
representative Bookman on the line.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.641
- Representative Bookman.
- I'm in New York right now.

12:07.265 --> 12:09.686
Some colleagues of mine and I
are taking meetings on Wall Street

12:09.811 --> 12:12.064
and then we're doing
a <i>Sex and the City</i> walking tour.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.995
Magnolia bakery?
Oh, sorry, hips.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.737
It looks like I'll have time to stop by
and continue our conversation.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.499
Good. I welcome it.
As I was trying to say the other day,

12:21.624 --> 12:23.482
this company has
a long-standing commitment

12:23.607 --> 12:25.118
to diversity and inclusiveness.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.831
I had dinner with Don Imus last night.
He told the following joke...

12:29.999 --> 12:31.249
Good-bye, congresswoman.

12:34.726 --> 12:36.463
I can't believe they rejected me.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.378
Of course they did.
The bridge was supposed to be

12:39.552 --> 12:41.468
shuffle-ball-change,
maxi Ford, Cincinnati,

12:41.636 --> 12:44.350
Cincinnati, double-time
shim-sham-shimmy, toe punch.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.181
I don't know what you were doing.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.101
- I'm sorry, miss Maroney.
- And where was your sparkle?

12:49.588 --> 12:52.315
You embarrassed me in front
of all the other mothers.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.899
If you think you're going to sizzler,
Jenna, you got another thing coming.

12:56.068 --> 12:59.317
You'll be practicing in the garage
until the school boat comes.

12:59.442 --> 13:01.820
If I hadn't seen you come out
of me in that parking,

13:01.945 --> 13:04.145
I'd swear you weren't my daughter.

13:05.442 --> 13:07.786
Oh, my God.
What just happened?

13:08.006 --> 13:11.206
- I think you just turned into...
- Let me get there.

13:11.695 --> 13:13.250
I've turned into my mother.

13:13.636 --> 13:16.437
And I turned you into me.

13:17.073 --> 13:18.755
You're welcome.
But it was wrong.

13:19.593 --> 13:21.924
- To make it up to me...
- Let me get there!

13:22.325 --> 13:24.979
To make it up to you,
I am going to get your job back

13:25.104 --> 13:26.972
or my name isn't
Yustrepa Gronkowitz.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.494
I mean, Jenna Maroney.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.187
Welcome to <i>Right On</i>.

13:35.357 --> 13:36.857
I'm your host, Rutherford Rice.

13:37.026 --> 13:39.608
With me is my co-host
Shirley Thomas.

13:40.179 --> 13:41.236
Our topic for today

13:41.405 --> 13:44.321
is African-Americans
and their roles in the Mia.

13:44.516 --> 13:47.245
Our first guest is James Spurlock,

13:47.370 --> 13:50.412
head writer
for TGS with Tracy Jordan.

13:50.642 --> 13:51.975
Good day, tri-staters.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.457
Co.
Co-head writer.

13:53.726 --> 13:56.626
And also with us is someone
named Elizabeth Lemon.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.741
Thank you, Rutherford.
It is a pl...

13:59.081 --> 14:00.707
I can tell that you're off me.

14:01.883 --> 14:05.050
Do you think
the system is broken when it is news

14:05.343 --> 14:07.095
that an African-American man

14:07.264 --> 14:09.282
is a head writer
for a network TV show?

14:09.474 --> 14:11.070
I think I can answer that.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.667
Another question
that we could be asking

14:13.792 --> 14:16.961
is why isn't it a big deal
that a woman is a head writer.

14:17.196 --> 14:19.094
I would argue that TV

14:19.219 --> 14:22.303
is more of a boys club
than a white club.

14:25.774 --> 14:27.442
I like your dress.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.748
Do you have to wear a bra with it?

14:30.475 --> 14:31.953
I will let you get back to Toofer.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.039
- Who's Toofer?
- I don't know.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.765
James, when people think of TGS,

14:37.890 --> 14:39.794
they think of Tracy Jordan,
Jenna Maroney,

14:40.031 --> 14:42.756
the mysterious crew deaths,
the Angela Lansbury lawsuit.

14:42.925 --> 14:46.510
What they don't think of is you
working long hours late into the night,

14:47.680 --> 14:50.296
giving up any semblance of a life.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.725
James Spurlock,
you can finally take your bow.

14:53.968 --> 14:57.562
You are right on's
Arthur Ashe of the week.

14:58.611 --> 15:00.899
You know what?
I get it. I shouldn't be here.

15:01.465 --> 15:04.736
I should have realized that when I saw
the masks, the picture of black Jesus.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.908
- That's me in college.
- All righty.

15:07.076 --> 15:10.412
All right, I said I was leaving.
You don't have to have your boss come...

15:10.537 --> 15:12.903
That's a security guard.
That's not great.

15:13.439 --> 15:15.786
Sir, representative Bookman
is on her way up.

15:15.911 --> 15:18.792
- Jonathan, what did we talk about?
- But, sir, I was born in Palo Alto.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.671
I will go get her, sir.
A thousand apologies.

15:22.914 --> 15:25.271
Jack, it's an actor me-mgency.

15:25.541 --> 15:27.479
I want to get Kenneth
back into the page program,

15:27.678 --> 15:29.385
but whatever this is won't let me.

15:29.555 --> 15:31.918
What? Who care Jeffrey,
just hire Kenneth back.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.975
- But Mr. Donaghy, the only...
- I don't have time for this. Do it.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.688
Representative Bookman,
welcome to NBC.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.829
This is the perfect place
to begin our tour.

15:42.045 --> 15:46.049
Studio 6H, home to one of NBCs
biggest stars, Tracy Jordan.

15:48.825 --> 15:52.325
We met at the congressional black caucus
fundraiser you crashed your moto into.

15:52.494 --> 15:55.521
And thank you, representative.
What you're doing is very important.

15:55.890 --> 16:00.095
I can assure you that NBC is committed
to making diversity a priority.

16:00.473 --> 16:02.877
Then just walk away
and don't try to kiss her,

16:03.046 --> 16:05.371
Tracy, and don't say that last part.

16:11.054 --> 16:14.972
You eat from your own table, remember?
Our food is separate. Separate!

16:15.141 --> 16:16.890
I'll kill you, white devil!

16:20.740 --> 16:22.480
Let's just head this way.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.158
So how was your flight?

16:34.538 --> 16:36.858
Congresswoman,
this is Jeffrey Winerslav.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.301
He heads our diversity
and hiring initiative.

16:39.426 --> 16:41.374
What's the latest
from H.R., Jeffrey?

16:41.542 --> 16:43.635
I'd like to tell you
that we filled the minority slot

16:43.760 --> 16:46.282
in the NBC page program
with a native American fellow

16:46.407 --> 16:48.089
named wants to get sandwiches,

16:49.091 --> 16:50.998
but you made me hire
that guy instead.

16:51.123 --> 16:52.223
Oh, brother.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.939
Mr. Shoelace, you're being silly.

16:56.312 --> 16:58.362
You call that a diversity hire?

16:59.063 --> 16:59.895
Maybe.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.054
That young man is a hillbilly
with a girl's middle name

17:03.179 --> 17:07.061
and, because his county
never rejoined the union, a foreigner.

17:07.186 --> 17:09.987
Now you're untied?
Have you two been talking?

17:12.191 --> 17:13.391
There's James.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.593
- Attention, everyone.
- Give me a break.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.454
I present you, James Spurlock,

17:21.496 --> 17:24.419
with the 2010 Tavis Smiley
excellence

17:24.544 --> 17:26.069
in broadcasting award.

17:26.316 --> 17:28.588
Thank you for making us all smiley.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.512
How long have
you been head writer here?

17:36.006 --> 17:36.846
One day.

17:38.446 --> 17:42.143
And who is the real
head writer of this show?

17:42.635 --> 17:43.603
I am.

17:45.930 --> 17:48.900
Tell me, you obviously
lonely and tired woman.

17:50.236 --> 17:53.017
Do you have to put up
with this nonsense every day?

17:53.489 --> 17:56.739
They say 90% of the work
is done by 10% of the people.

17:57.422 --> 17:59.869
- Thank you for being that 10%.
- You're welcome.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.707
After what I just saw, you may be
the only person here I respect.

18:04.886 --> 18:07.585
You get an
"I met a congresswoman" sticker.

18:09.192 --> 18:11.673
- Finally. That's all I wanted...
- This country was founded

18:12.830 --> 18:14.133
on certain principles.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.102
- Oh, brother.
- Freedom,

18:16.503 --> 18:17.345
troops,

18:17.513 --> 18:19.013
America, flag.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.019
Now I might not ow
where I'm going with this,

18:22.314 --> 18:25.292
but I know
we will get there together!

18:29.233 --> 18:31.151
Who loves pizza?

18:33.897 --> 18:35.613
Congresswoman, a word.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.790
I was putting on a show.
I was tap dancing.

18:46.353 --> 18:49.753
- But you made me tap dance.
- Did someone say tap dance?

18:52.963 --> 18:56.025
What was I supposed to do?
This is a multibillion-dollar deal.

18:56.150 --> 18:59.465
There are thousands of jobs at
stake, hundreds of second homes,

18:59.590 --> 19:01.973
and your ridiculous grandstanding
could ruin the whole thing,

19:02.141 --> 19:05.104
like luffing your spinnaker
during a yachting regatta.

19:05.391 --> 19:08.052
- I know I'm not helping myself.
- Sorry. Grandstanding?

19:08.342 --> 19:09.856
Do you not think I believe in this?

19:10.024 --> 19:12.566
It's just political theater.
You're up for reelection.

19:12.749 --> 19:16.196
Yes, maybe I get carried away
sometimes with my love

19:17.207 --> 19:21.367
for this great country
and the troops and the flagtroops...

19:21.742 --> 19:23.951
- You're doing it.
- And I apologize.

19:24.076 --> 19:26.233
But I only talk this way
so I can get people to listen.

19:26.358 --> 19:27.832
I care about these issues.

19:28.081 --> 19:29.131
And so do I.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.641
If you just give me a chance
instead of ambushing me

19:31.766 --> 19:33.797
in front of the congress
and my own employees.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.535
You think I don't take diversity
seriously?

19:36.660 --> 19:37.832
Only a fool doesn't.

19:37.957 --> 19:40.094
Diversity is the engine
that drives this country.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.981
We are an immigrant nation.

19:42.350 --> 19:45.022
The first generation works
their fingers to the bone making things.

19:45.190 --> 19:47.393
The next generation goes to college,
innovates new ideas.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.138
The third generation...

19:50.146 --> 19:52.065
snowboards and takes improv classes.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.727
We always need people
who are pulling themselves up

19:54.852 --> 19:55.978
by their bootstraps.

19:56.103 --> 19:57.103
I did it.

19:57.602 --> 20:00.270
And it's my job to help others
do it too.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.991
How do I know you really mean that?

20:02.159 --> 20:05.356
- And me, you're not grandstanding?
- I'll show you how.

20:05.641 --> 20:09.249
Unless you give me a real reason not to,
I'm voting no on this deal.

20:09.418 --> 20:11.588
Then I've got three months
to change your mind.

20:11.713 --> 20:13.913
I'll show you that this company...

20:15.673 --> 20:17.464
I'm cutting
that fat cracker's head off.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.467
I'm part eskimo.
Hate crime!

20:21.262 --> 20:22.136
Three months.

20:23.003 --> 20:24.264
We were here first!

20:44.549 --> 20:46.149
They closed the plant.

20:47.176 --> 20:48.662
I gave those people 30 years.

20:49.241 --> 20:52.584
I didn't even get a watch.
All I got was this pink slip.

20:52.986 --> 20:56.170
<i>You think you got it hard,
I've got two dates tonight.</i>

20:56.491 --> 20:58.739
Stanley, even for a dog,

20:58.864 --> 21:00.425
you are a dog.

21:01.686 --> 21:02.677
Great fix, Grizz.

21:11.745 --> 21:13.195
<i>Ain't life a bitch?</i>
