like that.

She said "maybe."

00:26.635 --> 00:28.245
You poor,
simple brute.

"Maybe" means she hates it
and she's letting him down easy.

that for years.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.885
Fats had Billy thrown
into a vat of acid.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.714
But after that, he didn't
have to worry about him at all.

08:17.758 --> 08:18.889
[laughs]

08:18.933 --> 08:20.238
You know what?
[chuckles]

08:20.282 --> 08:21.501
Maybe we just
shouldn't work together.

08:21.544 --> 08:22.545
Maybe we shouldn't.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.025
Maybe...

08:24.068 --> 08:25.505
ALBERTA AND HETTY:
Ooh...
[scoffs]

08:31.815 --> 08:34.296
Flower, I'm sure
I'll regret this,

08:34.339 --> 08:35.515
but are you
all right?

08:35.558 --> 08:37.255
[sighs] Well,

08:37.299 --> 08:39.519
I wanted to watch
the basketball game with Pete,

08:39.562 --> 08:42.043
but he only wants to watch
with stupid boys.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.306
I love basketball.

08:44.349 --> 08:45.525
Is that surprising?

08:45.568 --> 08:47.570
Um, a little,

08:47.614 --> 08:49.964
but-but I do know how much
you enjoy being disheveled

08:50.007 --> 08:52.096
and sweaty, so
that's not a far cry.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.576
I played in high school.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.752
One game, I had 20 points
in the first half,

08:55.796 --> 08:58.189
but then I didn't score
any after that

08:58.233 --> 09:00.844
'cause I got super high at
halftime with our point guard.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.411
I mean, we got some
really good stuff, man.

09:02.454 --> 09:05.109
[laughs] Wait, what were
we talking about?

09:05.153 --> 09:08.156
Basketball, but then
it veered wildly off course.Right.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.592
Yeah, I...

09:09.636 --> 09:12.029
I thought that after
the sexual revolution...

09:12.073 --> 09:14.510
Mm-hmm. Here we go....that this stuff
would get better.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.947
That women would
really be equal,

09:16.991 --> 09:18.775
but now it's 50 years later,

09:18.819 --> 09:21.386
and Pete isn't treating me
like an equal at all.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.387
Flower,

09:22.431 --> 09:25.086
I spent far too long

09:25.129 --> 09:27.349
forgiving the sins of men
in my lifetime.

09:27.392 --> 09:30.352
I see no reason why we need to
put up with it in the afterlife.

09:30.395 --> 09:31.658
Do not just sit there

09:31.701 --> 09:33.834
and take being disrespected
by a man.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.879
Do something about it.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.098
Talk to Peter.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.361
Damn, Hetty, are...

09:39.404 --> 09:40.841
are you a feminist now?

09:40.884 --> 09:43.321
Well, as long as it
doesn't mean supporting women

09:43.365 --> 09:46.020
handling money
or riding bicycles, then,

09:46.063 --> 09:48.326
yeah, I think
I am a feminist.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.024
[chuckles]

09:50.067 --> 09:52.461
THORFINN:
So... you going
to type something?

09:52.504 --> 09:56.291
It seem you just sitting
there for long time.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.640
I'm thinking, Thor.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.208
Thinking is a very
important part of writing.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.689
When you pillaged a village,
did you just run in?

10:02.732 --> 10:04.473
No, you planned it
out first.

10:04.516 --> 10:07.215
[laughs]: Never think.
Because once start thinking,

10:07.258 --> 10:09.217
then feel very bad
for murdering everyone.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.046
Okay, maybe that wasn't
the best example.

10:12.089 --> 10:14.048
I'm gonna get a snack.Yes!

10:14.091 --> 10:16.703
I will come
smell your snack.

10:16.746 --> 10:17.791
Great.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.184
Trevor, let's go.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.186
She left the laptop
unattended.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.449
I really don't feel good about
this. Why are we doing this?

10:24.493 --> 10:26.408
Because Sam has
no artistic vision.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.845
Okay, all she needs is to see
my ideas actually typed out,

10:28.889 --> 10:30.238
and then she'll get it.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.196
Damn it,
she closed the file.

10:32.240 --> 10:35.417
No problemo, T-Money is on it.
Which one is it?

10:35.460 --> 10:38.115
Uh... That one
right there.
Okay.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.423
[straining]

10:44.731 --> 10:45.688
Oh. Oh.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.168
What was that?

10:47.211 --> 10:48.691
I think I put it
in the trash.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.737
What? What is the trash?[shushes]

10:50.780 --> 10:51.825
[deep breath]

10:52.826 --> 10:55.437
[straining]

10:55.480 --> 10:57.657
Uh-oh.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.180
"Uh-oh"?
Why "uh-oh"?

10:59.223 --> 11:01.051
Maybe that was a good "whoosh."
Maybe it flew back.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.837
I think I just deleted
the B and B website.
What?

11:03.880 --> 11:06.143
Oh, yeah, it's gone.No, no.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.884
She's been working
on that for weeks.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.103
It's the final piece standing
between them opening the B and B

11:09.146 --> 11:10.582
and financial ruin.
It's...

11:10.626 --> 11:12.062
I told you it's really
an imperfect gift.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.673
[stammers]
Get it back.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.544
I don't know how.

11:15.587 --> 11:18.025
Oh, we are in
so much trouble.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.896
Run?
Run.

11:26.773 --> 11:29.558
PETE:
Thank God, I thought Mark
would never leave.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.865
Watching basketball
with Mark was so fun.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.605
You guys really hit it off, huh?

11:33.649 --> 11:35.216
You forget what it's like
to hang out with somebody

11:35.259 --> 11:37.827
who you can
talk to and see.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.873
Why don't you take
the arrow out of my neck

11:39.916 --> 11:41.831
and plunge it
into my back?

11:41.875 --> 11:43.354
JAY:
I hate to ask,

11:43.398 --> 11:45.661
but how's the copy
for the website coming?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.445
Well, you know,
I have made some progress,

11:47.489 --> 11:49.099
but there's still a ways to go.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.753
Great. Let me see.SAMANTHA: Okay.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.451
[chuckles] That's weird.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.802
What?The file's gone.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.587
Ugh, man. These two might want
to rethink taking on a business.

11:58.630 --> 11:59.893
What do you mean, gone?

11:59.936 --> 12:01.808
I mean, it's not there, Jay.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.331
Well, it's in the cloud.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.550
Sam, you back up
to the cloud, right?

12:05.594 --> 12:07.683
I was trying to save money,
so I declined

12:07.727 --> 12:09.511
the two-dollar-a-month
cloud storage thing.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.773
That's where we cut back?

12:10.817 --> 12:12.079
What's the cloud?

12:12.122 --> 12:15.082
Cloud is in sky.
Today look like dragon.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.345
Uh, we can explain.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.216
Trevor deleted
the website.What the...?

12:19.260 --> 12:20.348
What?
What happened?

12:20.391 --> 12:21.741
Sass wanted me
to type in

12:21.784 --> 12:23.525
his stupid tree stuff
into the file,

12:23.568 --> 12:25.788
and that is the only reason
I was even messing with it.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.399
Trevor and Sass accidentally
deleted the entire website.

12:28.443 --> 12:31.054
What? We've been working
on that for weeks.

12:31.098 --> 12:33.317
I'm so sorry, Sam. I just
wanted to get something down,

12:33.361 --> 12:35.145
and now I've
ruined everything.

12:35.189 --> 12:38.235
Well, you know,
these things happen.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.150
Ghosts deleting
the website

12:40.194 --> 12:42.457
that we need to start
our business? [laughs]

12:42.500 --> 12:44.067
That happens?

12:44.111 --> 12:46.287
Sorry, I'm gonna have
to push back on that, Sam.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.636
I mean, they seemed
really sorry.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.333
I-I guess
we just delay

12:49.377 --> 12:52.075
the opening until we have
time to redo the website.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.642
Anyways, thanks
for telling me.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.862
"Thanks for telling me"?

12:55.905 --> 12:57.777
What are you doing?

12:57.820 --> 13:00.692
Yell at them.
Yell at the ghosts.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.303
It was an accident, Jay.
Okay,

13:02.346 --> 13:03.826
w-we don't need this
to delay us.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.306
We'll just slap
something together

13:05.349 --> 13:06.698
and get it up and running,

13:06.742 --> 13:08.483
so we can start
taking reservations.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.702
No, it needs to be right.
I-It needs to be perfect.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.226
Once this website
goes live,

13:12.269 --> 13:14.619
that's it, we are open.
There's no turning back.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.012
But isn't that
what we wanted?

13:16.056 --> 13:18.275
That's why we quit our jobs
and moved up here.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.582
Exactly, and if this
B and B isn't a success,

13:20.625 --> 13:22.062
then I dragged us
all the way here

13:22.105 --> 13:23.541
and I made us
turn our lives

13:23.585 --> 13:26.283
upside down for nothing.
Don't you get that?

13:27.937 --> 13:29.547
There she goes.Ugh.

13:29.591 --> 13:32.202
Classic Sam storm-off.

13:33.638 --> 13:36.293
Hey, Pete, got a sec?I kind of just want

13:36.337 --> 13:37.729
to be alone right now
if that's okay.

13:37.773 --> 13:40.515
Yeah, well, it's not.

13:40.558 --> 13:41.821
What?

13:41.864 --> 13:43.213
You really bummed me out
today, man.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.998
You're all like,

13:45.041 --> 13:47.217
"Jay won't talk to me,
wah, wah, wah!"

13:47.261 --> 13:48.871
And the whole time,
I'm sitting there

13:48.915 --> 13:51.352
waiting to be the Bob Cousy
to your Bill Russell.

13:51.395 --> 13:52.875
How do you know about them?

13:52.919 --> 13:55.138
That's what I've been
trying to tell you, man.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.706
I mean, yeah, I'm a girl
and I'm into other groovy stuff,

13:57.749 --> 13:59.403
but I know basketball.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.362
The pick and roll.
The give and go.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.059
This is not something
I was aware of.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.148
Because you judged
a book by its cover.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.933
I even played
in high school,

14:06.976 --> 14:09.631
and I fouled out
of every game, Pete,

14:09.674 --> 14:11.589
because I am very aggressive.

14:11.633 --> 14:12.721
I mean, I'm all
for world peace,

14:12.764 --> 14:14.723
but if you reach, I will teach.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.899
I got sharp elbows, man.Wow.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.336
I-I'm sorry, Flower.
I guess I got

14:19.380 --> 14:21.948
so caught up being frustrated
with Jay for ditching me

14:21.991 --> 14:23.601
that I didn't realize
I was ditching you.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.647
Apology accepted.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.692
I'm so glad this whole thing
with Mark happened.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.129
It really opened my eyes.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.695
Me, too.

14:30.739 --> 14:32.480
And, hey, every once in a while,

14:32.523 --> 14:34.569
someone comes along
who changes the game.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.049
I mean...

14:36.092 --> 14:38.965
Mark's a regular
George Mikan, right? [laughs]

14:39.008 --> 14:40.662
[laughs] Who's that?

14:40.705 --> 14:43.404
George Mikan? Premier center
of the '40s and '50s.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.622
You seriously don't know him?

14:44.666 --> 14:46.189
[stammers]

14:46.233 --> 14:48.496
They created the
goaltending rule 'cause of him.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.411
I... I thought you said
you liked basketball.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.761
No, I do. I love basketball.
I love, I love basketball.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.763
[stammers]
Name someone else, please.

14:54.806 --> 14:57.722
Okay. Maurice Stokes?
Tom Gola?

14:57.766 --> 15:00.029
Oh, my God, well,
this is embarrassing.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.378
Jack Twyman?

15:01.422 --> 15:02.727
Okay, maybe one more.

15:02.771 --> 15:05.730
Okay, I can see I have
a lot of work to do.

15:05.774 --> 15:09.125
Well, don't worry,
I'll talk slow.Mm-hmm.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.084
Let's go back
to the beginning.Okay.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.434
Springfield, Mass,
1891.Uh-huh.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.871
Dr. James Naismith
was looking for a winter sport

15:15.915 --> 15:17.960
for his YMCA students.

15:19.266 --> 15:22.051
I see now what was going on.
You didn't want

15:22.095 --> 15:24.401
to finish the website because
then the B and B is real.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.231
It's just,
right now there's hope,

15:28.275 --> 15:30.668
but once we open, if it
doesn't work, then that's that.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.453
Well, that's
fear of failure,

15:32.496 --> 15:34.803
and I get it because
I used to suffer from it, too.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.239
Oh, come on, you're like

15:36.283 --> 15:37.980
the most confident person
I've ever met.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.939
I am now.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.766
Remember how I told you
my dad was worried

15:41.810 --> 15:43.203
about me becoming
a storyteller?

15:43.246 --> 15:44.900
You know, worried that
I would fail like he did?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.684
Yeah, I remember.Well, the truth was,

15:46.728 --> 15:48.208
he got in my head.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.774
All his worry

15:49.818 --> 15:52.125
transferred onto me,
and when it was finally the week

15:52.168 --> 15:53.778
of the fall
harvest ceremony,

15:53.822 --> 15:56.216
where I was supposed to tell
stories for the first time,

15:56.259 --> 15:58.740
I got scared.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.916
I don't want to go.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.136
You're right.
What if I'm not good?

16:03.179 --> 16:05.007
There's something
you need to know.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.792
That was about me,not you.

16:07.836 --> 16:10.273
I didn't have the gift,

16:10.317 --> 16:11.666
but you do.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.885
I know because
I've watched you

16:13.929 --> 16:15.539
your whole life.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.541
I'm giving you
this eagle feather.

16:17.585 --> 16:21.023
It represents
bravery and courage.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.721
It'll give you
the strength you need.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.209
Thank you, Father.

16:33.253 --> 16:36.865
And now
I give it to you.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.476
It's scary
spreading your wings

16:39.520 --> 16:42.566
to try something new,
but you can do this.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.484
What was that?

16:47.528 --> 16:48.964
Uh, it's a ghost feather,

16:49.008 --> 16:50.748
so it kind of just zaps
right back into place,

16:50.792 --> 16:52.533
but symbolically
it's yours.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.536
Thanks, Sass.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.712
What happened when you
finally got to story-tell?

16:57.755 --> 17:00.628
[sighs] Well, I...
actually never did.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.022
I died before
I-I got the chance to.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.849
Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.069
Ah, it's okay.
It wasn't meant to be.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.376
Well, did you ever tell
your stories to the ghosts?

17:09.419 --> 17:11.291
No, they're all wrapped up
in their own stuff,

17:11.334 --> 17:12.944
and the
important thing is,

17:12.988 --> 17:14.685
I've now passed
this feather onto you,

17:14.729 --> 17:17.384
symbolically, which
we've already established,

17:17.427 --> 17:19.647
so go, make it work
for you.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.214
Thanks.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.651
Hey, babe, um...

17:23.694 --> 17:25.435
So, I just want you
to know that,

17:25.479 --> 17:26.784
no matter what...Sasappis actually
just helped me have

17:26.828 --> 17:28.177
this whole
emotional breakthrough,

17:28.221 --> 17:29.526
so everything's fine now.
[chuckles]

17:29.570 --> 17:31.224
Oh. Nice.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.356
Well, just let the record state
that I was here for you.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.271
Thanks, babe.I had a whole speech planned.

17:35.315 --> 17:38.622
You're the best.Darn ghosts.
Always stealing my thunder.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.806
Babe, this is great, and I-I
love the part about the tree.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.199
That's so smart.

17:50.243 --> 17:51.940
Well, I had a little help
from my friend.

17:51.983 --> 17:55.552
So, are we opening the
bed-and-breakfast officially?

17:55.596 --> 17:57.467
Well, bring on
the unwashed masses.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.208
And congratulations,
Samantha.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.123
Okay.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.473
I think it's time
for this puppy to go live.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.346
Once we launch this, we'll
start getting reservations,

18:06.389 --> 18:09.088
and real live people-- no
offense to present company--

18:09.131 --> 18:10.437
are gonna start
coming here

18:10.480 --> 18:12.830
in four short weeks.
Are you ready?

18:12.874 --> 18:16.530
No, but I guess you got to
sink or swim sometime, right?

18:16.573 --> 18:18.314
Here we go.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.751
And we are... live.[clicks]

18:20.795 --> 18:22.144
Ooh.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.581
Do we have any
reservations yet?

18:24.625 --> 18:26.540
It's been
four seconds, babe.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.890
Right, right, yeah,
so not a total failure...

18:28.933 --> 18:30.109
[both chuckle]
...yet.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.023
Ooh. Game's almost on.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.417
Big East championship.

18:34.461 --> 18:37.116
The Big East was a college
basketball conference, Pete.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.466
Yes, thank you, Flower.JAY: Huh.

18:39.509 --> 18:41.903
It's not working.
Hmm.

18:41.946 --> 18:43.644
Something must be wrong
with the TV.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.907
But with the TV
not working,

18:45.950 --> 18:48.170
what will we do
for entertainment?

18:48.214 --> 18:50.477
Hmm, that is an
excellent question.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.175
Is anyone here
a gifted storyteller?

18:55.046 --> 18:56.874
Oh, come on,
are you guys serious?

18:56.918 --> 18:59.877
We don't want to pressure you,
but if you regale us with story,

18:59.921 --> 19:01.836
it would bring us
great honor.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.316
You did this,
didn't you?

19:03.359 --> 19:04.752
Maybe...

19:04.795 --> 19:07.015
[chuckles] Okay.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.235
Yes! All right![overlapping chatter]

19:09.278 --> 19:11.193
Here we go.
Stories!

19:11.237 --> 19:14.675
I don't know why I'm nervous.
I mean, you all are idiots.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.851
You got this. Just, uh,
imagine us all in our underwear.

19:16.894 --> 19:19.201
I wish I was wearing underwear.We all do, Trevor.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.507
SASAPPIS:Okay.

19:20.550 --> 19:23.466
Here we go.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.468

19:25.512 --> 19:27.905
[whispers]:
He's going for it.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.431
This first one is a Lenape tale

19:31.474 --> 19:35.043
about the turkey, the turtle,
and the wolf.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.436
They say that
there are

19:36.479 --> 19:38.089
three persons,

19:38.133 --> 19:40.483
or human-like animals,

19:40.527 --> 19:41.919
