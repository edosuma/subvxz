WEBVTT

00:03.119 --> 00:04.986
Dude, somebody's
got to play it,
right?

00:05.121 --> 00:06.488
(BUZZES)

00:07.556 --> 00:08.723
You know, Universe,
if you were going
to give me

00:08.725 --> 00:10.692
practically
unbustable brothers,

00:10.694 --> 00:13.795
you could at least have
made them not morning people.

00:13.797 --> 00:15.931
Yeah, I see you
down there.

00:16.098 --> 00:17.632
Hey, where's Perry?

00:18.100 --> 00:19.834
(CHATTERING)

00:19.836 --> 00:21.703
Sorry you had to pull
that all-nighter,

00:21.705 --> 00:24.072
but we really appreciate
you filling in for Agent Q.

00:24.074 --> 00:26.708
<i>With most everyone</i>
<i>down at Agent-Con</i>
<i>this week,</i>

00:26.710 --> 00:27.876
we're, uh,
a little short-handed.

00:31.814 --> 00:34.549
Yet again,
I am the only girl.

00:34.784 --> 00:35.583
<i>Anyway, Agent P,</i>

00:35.585 --> 00:38.720
<i>Doofenshmirtz</i>
<i>has been experimenting</i>
<i>with energy fields</i>

00:38.822 --> 00:40.789
<i>and it's starting</i>
<i>to get dangerous.</i>

00:40.791 --> 00:42.524
<i>It knocked out</i>
<i>our microwave oven!</i>

00:42.526 --> 00:44.793
Get out there, Agent P,
and right that
ridiculous wrong.

00:44.927 --> 00:46.761
This breakfast burrito
is like a,

00:46.763 --> 00:48.496
bean and cheese icicle,

00:48.631 --> 00:51.733
except that it's larger
and wrapped in a tortilla.

00:54.170 --> 00:57.138
Hey, Phineas.
What are you doing?
Hey, Isabella.

00:57.573 --> 00:59.941
You're just in time
to help us build
a zip line tennis game

00:59.943 --> 01:02.844
across town
for the ultimate
game of sky tennis.

01:02.846 --> 01:03.944
Or "Skennis,"
for short.

01:03.946 --> 01:07.415
Now that you're here,
we can play doubles
for twice the fun!

01:07.550 --> 01:08.917
I'll be the judge
of that.

01:08.919 --> 01:11.653
Perfect! 'Cause we need
you to be the line judge!

01:11.854 --> 01:14.889
Judge? Cool!
Do I get one of
those powdered wigs?

01:14.891 --> 01:16.624
No.
Ah, I'll do
it anyway.

01:16.892 --> 01:20.729
CHORUS: (SINGING)
<i>♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil</i>
<i>Incorporated! ♪</i>

01:20.731 --> 01:23.732
Woof! Woof!
Intruder approaching!

01:23.734 --> 01:25.200
Woof! Woof, Woof!

01:25.202 --> 01:28.670
Good boy.
I love this new
guard dog software.

01:28.672 --> 01:29.770
It's about time,
Perry the Platypus.

01:29.772 --> 01:33.708
I was beginning to think
you'd found another evil
scientist to fight. Oop!

01:33.710 --> 01:36.611
Oh, what a little angel.

01:36.613 --> 01:38.913
I'll just have to
tell you my evil plan
subliminally,

01:38.915 --> 01:42.117
like, like when people listen
to foreign language CDs
in their sleep.

01:42.518 --> 01:45.820
I did that once,
and now I can totally speak
Portuguese to sleeping people.

01:45.822 --> 01:48.757
Anyway, recently
I was musing
to myself

01:48.759 --> 01:51.192
about how lucky
my brother,
Roger, is.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.194
<i>Luck is called</i>
<i>"stinkelkrampen"</i>
<i>in Drusselstein</i>

01:53.729 --> 01:55.797
<i>and I never seem</i>
<i>to have any of</i>
<i>the good kind.</i>

01:56.065 --> 02:00.268
<i>Turns out that every</i>
<i>object has a positive</i>
<i>or negative energy field.</i>

02:00.270 --> 02:02.904
<i>I harnessed that positive</i>
<i>and negative energy</i>

02:02.906 --> 02:05.807
and created the
Stinkelkrampen-inator!

02:05.809 --> 02:07.842
(YAWNS)
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh!

02:08.177 --> 02:10.779
You see, what I'll do
is I'll zap myself
with good luck,

02:10.781 --> 02:13.548
and then I'll go zap
Roger with bad luck.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.817
Then, I will ascend
to become the mayor
of Danville

02:15.819 --> 02:18.787
and then I will rule
the entire Tri-State...

02:18.789 --> 02:21.990
(YAWNS)
I will rule the entire
Tri-State Area.

02:21.992 --> 02:24.192
Aw, man!
Norm, I told you,

02:24.194 --> 02:26.828
on the paper.
On the paper!

02:26.830 --> 02:27.896
Bad Dog.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.264
Looking good, guys.

02:29.266 --> 02:31.299
All we need to do
is hammer in this
last nail

02:31.301 --> 02:32.901
and we'll be
ready to go.

02:35.237 --> 02:37.072
Huh, that's odd.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.907
Glad, I always
carry a spare.

02:40.176 --> 02:43.078
Whoa. Good thing
you're wearing your
steel tip sneakers.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.581
Actually,
today I'm not.
Ouch.

02:46.849 --> 02:49.150
And that is
how the bad luck
setting works!

02:49.152 --> 02:52.654
Except, of course,
I won't be shooting random
blasts off the balcony.

02:52.656 --> 02:54.722
Now check out
the good luck
settings!

02:54.724 --> 02:57.892
And again,
I won't be just shooting it
off the balcony like this.

02:58.894 --> 03:02.931
Time to embark on my daily
500 brush stroke marathon
to manageable hair.

03:04.633 --> 03:06.301
One. What the...

03:07.603 --> 03:09.704
A perfect 40 degree angle?

03:09.706 --> 03:14.008
I can't believe it!
A perfect hair day!
I finally got my P.H.D!

03:14.243 --> 03:15.242
Oh, that's wonderful, honey.

03:15.244 --> 03:18.713
Not a single day goes by
when I don't appreciate
my P.H.D.

03:18.715 --> 03:20.682
That's great, Dad,
but I'm not talking
about a degree.

03:20.816 --> 03:21.916
Oh, neither am I!

03:23.285 --> 03:26.287
Time to take
my perfect hair
to a bust show.

03:26.856 --> 03:29.757
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Hello?
You're kidding!

03:29.759 --> 03:32.193
I won a random contest
to sing back-up
for Love Handel

03:32.195 --> 03:35.730
at the Danville 24 hour
music awards? Sweet!

03:35.732 --> 03:38.133
Perfect hair day?
Back-up singer
for Love Handel?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.734
That could only mean...

03:39.736 --> 03:41.803
Wait, let me try
one last thing.

03:42.738 --> 03:45.640
(GASPS)
Pillows magically appear
to break my fall!

03:45.642 --> 03:47.942
It's true. I'm finally
having good luck!

03:48.677 --> 03:50.044
I was using
my P.H.D.,

03:50.046 --> 03:52.780
My "Pillow Hurling
Dexterity."

03:53.015 --> 03:53.914
Meh, still lucky.

03:53.916 --> 03:57.819
(GASPS) I'll actually
be able to bust Phineas
and Ferb today!

03:57.821 --> 04:00.255
Oh, wait.
Mom's at that weekend-long
plant-potting retreat.

04:00.257 --> 04:02.290
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
Hi, Mom!

04:02.292 --> 04:03.791
The seminar's over
already?

04:04.860 --> 04:05.959
Yeah, apparently
you just put some
dirt in a pot.

04:05.961 --> 04:08.363
I don't know
why I cleared
my whole schedule.

04:08.430 --> 04:10.365
Great!
See you at 4:00.
Yes!

04:10.367 --> 04:13.768
Today is the day that
I bust Phineas and Ferb!

04:13.770 --> 04:15.069
Whoo-hoo!

04:16.138 --> 04:17.037
I just don't
get it.

04:17.039 --> 04:20.175
Everything we try to do
either falls apart, breaks,

04:20.177 --> 04:21.776
or somehow
ends up
backwards.

04:21.778 --> 04:23.945
I know this
goes completely
against all logic

04:23.947 --> 04:26.881
and therefore makes it
totally out of character
for me to say,

04:26.883 --> 04:29.284
but I think you may have
been cursed with bad luck.

04:29.518 --> 04:31.085
(GASPS) Bad luck?

04:33.856 --> 04:35.423
Dude, I call 'em
like I see 'em.

04:35.925 --> 04:38.459
Hmm. Bad luck.
That's a new one!

04:38.861 --> 04:40.895
It happens.
There's not much
you can do about it.

04:41.130 --> 04:43.932
No! There is something
we can do about it.

04:43.934 --> 04:46.701
If we can
create algorithms
to predict bad luck,

04:46.703 --> 04:49.204
we can make
allowances for it
and still have fun.

04:49.371 --> 04:50.838
Just like the
fail-safe system

04:50.840 --> 04:52.340
on space capsules
or airplanes.

04:52.741 --> 04:55.910
Exactly.
We'll make having
bad luck fun!

04:55.912 --> 04:57.011
Cool!

04:57.013 --> 04:58.246
Okay, it's time
to go.

04:58.447 --> 04:59.847
Luck and cover.

05:01.450 --> 05:04.219

Good stinkelkrampen
tickles!

05:04.221 --> 05:06.854
(GASPS) Look! A penny!
It's working.

05:06.856 --> 05:08.356
Aw, man! Tails.

05:08.757 --> 05:10.158
Well, you know
the rules, Heinz.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.093
Turn it over for
the next person.

05:12.294 --> 05:14.262
I say, a lucky penny!

05:14.264 --> 05:15.897
Thanks for the flip,
old bean.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.765
Here is $1,000.

05:17.767 --> 05:20.068
(SQUEALS) It worked.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.270
(CHUCKLES)
Ooh, time to
give Roger

05:22.272 --> 05:25.173
a dose of
bad stinkelkrampen
he'll never forget!

05:25.341 --> 05:28.943
Okay, team!
All fail-safe systems
are in place.

05:28.945 --> 05:30.378
Go! Yeah!

05:30.913 --> 05:33.181
What a great day
for sky tennis,
huh, Markus?

05:33.183 --> 05:34.881
Or "Skennis,"
as the locals
call it, Mark.

05:35.150 --> 05:37.885
MARK:   <i>Phineas and the</i>
<i>gang have the ball</i>
<i>in play, so here we go.</i>

05:37.887 --> 05:41.489
MARKUS:   <i>Lob to Phineas</i>
<i>and Ferb as Phineas sets</i>
<i>up for a powerful return.</i>

05:41.491 --> 05:43.992
<i>Ooh, looks like</i>
<i>Baljeet is positioned</i>
<i>perfectly for...</i>

05:43.994 --> 05:45.360
<i>Oh, no!</i>
<i>(SCREAMS)</i>

05:45.362 --> 05:46.761
MARK:   <i>What</i>
<i>rotten luck!</i>

05:46.763 --> 05:48.896
Let's just hope
Baljeet survives
the fall.

05:49.031 --> 05:50.965
But Isabella is
right there
with the save.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.867
<i>And apparently</i>
<i>so is Baljeet!</i>

05:53.202 --> 05:55.270
<i>A beautiful air</i>
<i>bag maneuver, Mark.</i>

05:55.272 --> 05:57.071
<i>Which bounces him</i>
<i>right back into</i>
<i>the game.</i>

05:57.806 --> 05:59.874
Down we go,
Perry the Sleep-apus.

06:01.810 --> 06:03.344
And away we go.

06:04.947 --> 06:05.880
Sweet!

06:07.116 --> 06:08.316
Free samples?

06:08.450 --> 06:09.784
Thank you!

06:10.986 --> 06:13.488
(CHOMPS) Mmm,
I could get used to
this good luck thing.

06:13.490 --> 06:16.324
It's better than
having a genie.
That was a mistake.

06:16.825 --> 06:18.359
That wasn't a wish,
it's just a song.

06:18.361 --> 06:20.028
It's, it's not
even a song.
It's a jingle.

06:20.462 --> 06:22.797
Ugh! You ever try
to sue a genie?

06:24.033 --> 06:26.934
Let's see what kind of tunes
are on the FM dial.
(SONG PLAYING)

06:26.936 --> 06:28.936
Hey, I love this song!

06:28.938 --> 06:31.239

surprised at this point,

Not to mention the

Well, hello, Roger.

Hello, Heinz.
What can I do for you?

Well, little brother,

you have had nothing

your whole life

07:44.314 --> 07:47.014

even things up
for once.

Oh, Heinz,
the power of positive
stinkelkrampen

07:49.953 --> 07:51.886
is the result of hard work,
strong networking,

07:51.888 --> 07:55.156
and thoughtful actions
in matters both business
and personal.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.159
(SCOFFS)
I prefer to inator
my way to success.

07:58.161 --> 07:59.894

in my book.

amazing.

Hey, do you guys have
a permit to do sports
commentary on this roof?

08:23.152 --> 08:25.353
We totally
have one.
We do.

It's in the
production truck
downstairs.

Hi, Mom.

I know you wanna drag me
to the backyard right now,
Candace,

08:35.729 --> 08:37.565
but can it wait until
I repot my new plant?

08:37.566 --> 08:40.301
No prob, Mom.
Take your time.

08:40.303 --> 08:42.370
Okay...

08:42.372 --> 08:44.605
Uh, thanks, hon.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.405

guard this alcove,
Mr. Secret Agent Plant?

Sorry, Planty
the Potted Plant.

All right, Roger.
Prepare to suffer
the bad luck of the...

09:07.730 --> 09:09.630
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, wait,
wait a minute!

09:09.632 --> 09:11.730
You're supposed to stay
still for a good inatoring!

09:11.732 --> 09:15.703
Aww, but I just realized
that I haven't said hello to
your little platypus friend.

09:15.705 --> 09:18.139
Careful. He gets a little
testy if he wakes up
from his nap too soon.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.540
(FLOOR CREAKS)
Uh-oh.

09:19.741 --> 09:22.710
(GRUNTS)
Oh, yes, I'm not
a morning person either.

09:23.045 --> 09:24.645
Great game, guys.

09:24.647 --> 09:29.083
Hello, brothers!
I made you a pie!
For your bust-day!

09:29.085 --> 09:30.351
Well, that can't
be right.

09:30.353 --> 09:31.752
Bus Day isn't
until next week.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.588
Guess she's getting
a head start.

09:33.722 --> 09:35.756
(GROANING)

09:37.726 --> 09:41.195
Aah! Oh, no.
Now, my luck's gonna
go back to normal.

09:41.197 --> 09:43.064
<i>Which is of course bad.</i>

09:43.066 --> 09:44.665
Just take
your time.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.002
It's not like the Earth
is going to open up
and swallow it.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.470
Not today!

09:50.072 --> 09:52.340
(GASPS) Oh, no!
That means...

09:52.774 --> 09:54.642
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom!

09:54.644 --> 09:56.611
(RUMBLING)
(ALL GASP)

10:01.783 --> 10:04.485
And right after Candace
said that couldn't happen.

10:04.487 --> 10:06.621
Yeah, that's
borderline
creepy.

10:06.623 --> 10:09.090
Candace, you still haven't
explained why you're
covered with pie.

10:09.092 --> 10:11.726
Oh, just come on.
This'll explain everything.
Bu-bu... Wha...

10:12.094 --> 10:15.062
Hi, Mom!
(STAMMERING)
but...

10:15.697 --> 10:17.698
Well, my luck
may be back
to normal,

10:17.700 --> 10:22.737
but at least I still have
an entire trunk full of
delicious almond brittle.

10:23.739 --> 10:25.606
(SCREAMS)

10:25.608 --> 10:26.306
Ugh.

10:26.308 --> 10:30.678
Mental note, never accept
canned confections from
a guy in a clown suit.
