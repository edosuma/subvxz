01:12.000 --> 01:13.211
Nathan!

01:14.000 --> 01:15.596
Nathan!

01:16.000 --> 01:17.773
Nathan!

01:18.367 --> 01:20.618
Help me!

01:23.992 --> 01:25.375
Haley!

01:25.443 --> 01:26.777
Haley! Haley! You okay?

01:26.777 --> 01:28.956
Oh, my God. Okay.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.391
Breathe, Haley. Just breathe.

01:42.740 --> 01:45.104
I was just trying to feel something.

01:46.156 --> 01:50.627
Like... alive, I guess.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.797
And did that make you feel alive?

01:55.266 --> 01:56.583
No.

01:59.670 --> 02:01.771
But it made me want to.

02:07.895 --> 02:12.782
Julian, I thought we agreed we
weren't gonna hang posters out here.

02:12.850 --> 02:14.484
I didn't hang a...

02:34.000 --> 02:36.189
What are you up to?

02:36.507 --> 02:39.876
I love your back.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.728
You know where we should go?

02:41.812 --> 02:43.813
Julian's movie premiere.

02:43.881 --> 02:46.316
Maybe we could talk Nathan
and Haley into going.

02:46.383 --> 02:49.269
Might be good for her to get away.

02:49.336 --> 02:53.723
And then we... could...

02:53.774 --> 02:56.409
ski.

02:56.494 --> 02:59.112
Girls that can spell are sexy.

03:00.798 --> 03:04.851
Then we could stay up all night and...

03:04.919 --> 03:06.202
F...

03:06.253 --> 03:08.087
U...

03:08.155 --> 03:09.739
Are terrible.

03:12.176 --> 03:14.294
I'm just insanely in love with you.

03:14.378 --> 03:16.062
As promised.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.880
I wish I could tell you
there was a magic cure, Haley.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.310
But depression is a singular struggle.

03:30.394 --> 03:32.729
Some people just wake up one day

03:32.796 --> 03:35.932
and feel a little better
than the day before.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.240
Hi, mama. How you feeling?

03:45.943 --> 03:47.777
Come here.

03:50.748 --> 03:55.001
What was that you were saying the
other day about wanting to see snow?

03:55.085 --> 03:58.304
Well, aunt Brooke says it's snowy in Utah,

03:58.389 --> 04:01.591
and that's where
Julian's movie is playing.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.125
And everyone's going.

04:06.597 --> 04:08.147
Everyone, huh?

04:08.215 --> 04:09.182
Yeah.

04:10.351 --> 04:13.686
Maybe you should try this on.

04:15.606 --> 04:18.791
Yeah, I don't... I don't want
your ears to get cold in the snow.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.142
You mean we can go?

04:21.528 --> 04:23.446
Oh! I got to tell dad.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.614
Jamie.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.733
Yeah?

04:27.985 --> 04:29.369
I love you.

04:29.453 --> 04:31.187
I love you, too.

04:31.255 --> 04:33.273
Dad, we're going to Utah!

04:57.331 --> 04:58.881
Swimwear 10 bucks and under.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.737
Oh, yeah. I think there's room.

04:47.805 --> 04:50.173
There's trees in the
house and moose antlers.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.909
There's 12 of us.

04:52.977 --> 04:55.796
Only six bedrooms and a couple of couches.

04:58.833 --> 04:59.883
Dibs.

05:06.257 --> 05:08.175
You had them lock the master, right?

05:08.242 --> 05:09.676
Don't worry. We're good.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.228
Hey, uh, you need some help drinking that?

05:26.644 --> 05:29.946
Lauren told me what you said
about us being boys and all.

05:30.014 --> 05:32.516
I know we never really
talked about it, but...

05:32.583 --> 05:34.334
It meant a lot to me.

05:34.402 --> 05:37.120
Thanks, but... I just want to get back

05:37.205 --> 05:39.105
to the way we used to be, you know?

05:39.157 --> 05:40.707
Yeah, I feel that.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.976
Anyway, this trip 'bout to be insane.

05:44.829 --> 05:46.946
Plus, I get to rock my
new coat I just got in L.A.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.920
Check this out.

05:56.524 --> 05:59.176
Dude. No.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.732
Hey, everyone! Dad! Come on!

06:05.799 --> 06:08.318
Doesn't anyone want to play?

06:20.064 --> 06:22.082
Ugh. I think I got some in my mouth.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.451
As long as it's not yellow,
I think you'll be fine.

06:26.037 --> 06:28.205
Hey, dad, can we build a snow fort?

06:28.289 --> 06:29.556
I can build you a snow fort, buddy.

06:29.624 --> 06:30.990
Okay, cool.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.776
Wait... how do we know you, again?

06:32.843 --> 06:34.844
I'm Chase.

06:34.929 --> 06:36.730
The bartender at Tric?

06:39.333 --> 06:41.218
Whatever. You're no Grubbs.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.123
Retreat! Retreat!

07:53.207 --> 07:56.242
Oh, you guys are so dead!

09:18.000 --> 09:19.861
Are you excited about tomorrow night?

09:20.962 --> 09:22.629
Yeah.

09:22.697 --> 09:25.865
My dad says three things have
to happen at this festival.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.918
The audience has to love the movie,

09:28.002 --> 09:32.255
we have to sell it, and I
have to decide what's next.

09:32.323 --> 09:36.927
Well, not to sound naive, but
maybe you should just enjoy it.

09:37.011 --> 09:40.097
Yeah. I'd just enjoy it.

09:42.150 --> 09:44.050
It's a good life.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.157
Alex DuprÃ©.?

09:50.224 --> 09:52.392
Right. Maybe two rehabs ago.

09:52.443 --> 09:53.660
Back of the line.

09:56.230 --> 09:58.165
Hey, hold up.

09:58.232 --> 09:59.366
I like that coat, man.

09:59.434 --> 10:01.118
Oh, that's what I'm talking about, baby.

10:01.185 --> 10:03.987
Okay... him, him, and
the ladies, they with me.

10:04.055 --> 10:05.005
Thanks.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.256
Not him.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.740
Back of the line. Let's go.

10:07.792 --> 10:10.127
Nah, I'm just kidding. He with us, too.

10:10.211 --> 10:13.196
All right. Come on, man. Hurry up.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.048
People love the coat, baby!

10:15.099 --> 10:16.583
Oh. Dang.

10:35.856 --> 10:37.240
Stop worrying about her.

10:37.324 --> 10:38.358
What?

10:38.426 --> 10:40.210
You're worrying about Haley.

10:40.294 --> 10:43.630
All right, look... she's
with Nate. She's fine.

10:43.697 --> 10:45.915
Besides, I got you a few things.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.916
White wine.

10:47.001 --> 10:48.685
Thank you.

10:48.753 --> 10:51.938
And a kiss, because my
baby looks amazing tonight.

10:53.641 --> 10:57.677
And, last but not least,
a spare key to the house,

10:57.728 --> 10:59.763
because you lose things.

10:59.847 --> 11:02.048
I do not lose things.

11:02.099 --> 11:04.550
Look, just put it outside somewhere.

11:04.602 --> 11:07.070
You know what? I'm
gonna keep my white wine.

11:07.154 --> 11:08.938
And you can have your kiss back.

11:09.023 --> 11:11.658
But I don't need the key,
because I don't lose things.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.145
Who want to dance?

11:15.145 --> 11:16.512
I do.

11:18.265 --> 11:20.633
Where's your, uh, "boyfriend" tonight?

11:20.684 --> 11:22.001
I'm looking at him.

11:22.052 --> 11:24.771
You're the devil, aren't you?

11:26.607 --> 11:27.974
Why?

11:28.025 --> 11:30.393
Because you know I just broke up with Mia.

11:31.367 --> 11:33.035
So?

11:34.821 --> 11:37.639
So I'm taking off, devil DuprÃ©.

11:37.707 --> 11:40.375
And I'm locking my door.

11:42.278 --> 11:44.513
She was sexy until she started dancing.

11:47.584 --> 11:50.469
Lose the beat?

12:02.015 --> 12:04.066
How you doing?

12:04.133 --> 12:08.320
I gave this flower to Miranda.

12:08.404 --> 12:12.107
It's just another thing she left behind.

12:12.158 --> 12:14.243
Doesn't mean she doesn't miss you.

12:14.310 --> 12:21.033
There's just so much that I wish I
would have said the last time I saw her.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.051
What did you say?

12:23.119 --> 12:25.587
Nothing.

12:25.655 --> 12:28.340
Then say it in here.

12:28.424 --> 12:30.959
You know, write one more great song.

12:31.027 --> 12:32.661
Let's finish this record.

12:32.712 --> 12:35.447
Then what?

12:35.515 --> 12:36.949
Well...

12:37.016 --> 12:39.034
if I was you...

12:39.102 --> 12:41.520
I'd start my tour in London.

12:41.604 --> 12:44.940
And I'd water that orchid.

12:47.143 --> 12:49.561
Grubbs.

12:49.646 --> 12:53.014
I know it feels bad now...

12:53.066 --> 12:55.817
but it's gonna get better.

12:55.868 --> 12:57.386
One more song.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.886
It was a good night tonight.

13:22.679 --> 13:24.296
And now it's a better night.

13:24.364 --> 13:26.748
I think you were right
about me losing stuff.

13:26.816 --> 13:30.936
I seem to have, uh, lost my clothes.

13:35.575 --> 13:36.825
Where you going?

13:39.779 --> 13:41.830
Now I've lost my way to the bed.

13:41.897 --> 13:44.683
Guess I'll just have
to sleep somewhere else.

13:46.919 --> 13:48.253
No.

14:00.916 --> 14:03.719
She's good.

14:03.770 --> 14:05.604
She's good.

14:05.688 --> 14:07.689
I made a place for you on the floor.

14:07.757 --> 14:10.859
Right. Shut up and scoot over.

14:14.197 --> 14:16.531
I thought maybe you'd
end up in Chase's room.

14:16.599 --> 14:19.601
I tried. He locked the door.

14:19.652 --> 14:22.070
I know. I tried, too.

14:31.030 --> 14:33.432
Do you ever think about coming out?

14:33.499 --> 14:36.568
My dad's a football coach, Alex.

14:36.636 --> 14:40.839
And my mom... my mom's
a football coach's wife.

14:40.907 --> 14:43.608
She loves this version of me...

14:43.676 --> 14:46.745
the leading man.

14:46.813 --> 14:49.731
So...

14:49.799 --> 14:52.067
Well...

14:52.135 --> 14:54.036
For what it's worth, if I was a mom,

14:54.103 --> 14:56.138
I don't think there could be any words

14:56.205 --> 14:59.474
that would ever make
me stop loving my child.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.810
Unless, of course, those words were

15:01.861 --> 15:03.478
"mom and dad, I secretly made a sex tape."

15:06.182 --> 15:09.418
It's amazing how much I hate you.

15:11.170 --> 15:13.705
Jamie had a blast today.

15:13.790 --> 15:15.957
The guys built him a snow fort.

15:21.297 --> 15:24.683
I know that you came here just for him.

15:24.767 --> 15:27.636
I do.

15:27.687 --> 15:30.939
And I love you for that, Haley.

15:34.844 --> 15:38.029
Please don't think that
I take that for granted.

15:40.483 --> 15:42.534
I'm so grateful for...

15:42.602 --> 15:44.569
who you've been through all of this.

15:44.654 --> 15:46.405
And how you've been.

15:46.489 --> 15:49.541
There's no other way for me to be.

15:49.609 --> 15:52.360
You've saved me so many times.

15:55.415 --> 16:00.368
I worry that I've been selfish with you.

16:00.420 --> 16:04.589
That I've taken advantage of your strength

16:04.674 --> 16:08.360
and your selflessness...

16:08.428 --> 16:10.679
And that I've... I've broken you somehow.

16:10.747 --> 16:12.731
No, no.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.934
You haven't. You didn't.

16:16.018 --> 16:20.422
I just have a weight in my heart
now that I didn't have before.

16:24.393 --> 16:27.112
It was lighter today, though.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.033
It's beautiful, isn't it?

16:46.064 --> 16:47.965
Yeah.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.851
It makes me think of mom.

16:50.902 --> 16:53.003
She would have liked it.

16:53.071 --> 16:54.354
Yeah.

16:54.406 --> 16:58.059
Well, you know mom believed
in reincarnation, right?

16:58.126 --> 17:01.195
So I think we'll see her again.

17:01.263 --> 17:03.631
What do you think she'll be?

17:05.901 --> 17:07.233
Different.

17:09.537 --> 17:11.105
I think she'll be an owl.

17:11.173 --> 17:14.892
A beautiful, majestic, sarcastic owl.

17:17.045 --> 17:19.512
I just wish she could be here again.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.384
I can't believe you actually
locked your door last night.

17:48.409 --> 17:50.661
I can't believe you
actually tried to get in.

17:50.729 --> 17:52.546
Would that be so bad?

17:54.015 --> 17:58.068
Says the girl who just wants
someone normal and reliable.

17:58.136 --> 17:59.770
You said that at Tric.

17:59.855 --> 18:01.138
You were listening.

18:01.223 --> 18:04.225
Of course I was listening.
I'm a bartender... manager.

18:04.276 --> 18:05.976
And almost pilot.

18:06.061 --> 18:07.812
I was listening, too.

18:10.565 --> 18:13.984
I'd crush out on you,
and then you'd be gone.

18:27.115 --> 18:29.717
Hi, mama. Come on in. You like it?

18:31.670 --> 18:35.055
Oh, I do like it.

18:35.123 --> 18:37.324
This is great, buddy!

18:37.392 --> 18:39.210
Oh, my goodness.

18:43.732 --> 18:45.115
What do you like about it?

18:45.183 --> 18:48.602
I like that it's quiet.

18:48.653 --> 18:50.321
It feels kind of safe in here.

18:50.388 --> 18:53.774
That's smart, kiddo.

18:53.825 --> 18:56.494
So, listen... I was thinking
about going into town

18:56.578 --> 18:58.279
and buying a dress for tonight.

18:58.330 --> 18:59.713
What do you think?

18:59.781 --> 19:02.166
You want to, uh, get a
suit for Julian's premiere?

19:02.250 --> 19:04.235
Can I pick it out myself?

19:04.302 --> 19:06.370
Yes. Okay.

19:06.454 --> 19:08.005
Okay.

19:10.008 --> 19:12.126
It's a really cool fort, Jame.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.427
Yeah.

19:20.428 --> 19:21.371
Clay?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.896
"No cellphone coverage.

19:30.896 --> 19:32.880
Went to lunch at the diner on main.

19:32.948 --> 19:36.400
Come by, unless you've
lost your appetite."

19:39.604 --> 19:41.539
Hot tub.

19:48.196 --> 19:50.347
Oh... beers.

20:46.000 --> 20:46.967
Key.

20:48.294 --> 20:49.896
Why? Uh...

20:49.896 --> 20:51.283
What happened?

20:51.283 --> 20:54.691
Key.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.460
She loses things.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.848
Mama, I found my suit.

21:15.884 --> 21:19.654
Well, that is quite a suit of clothes.

21:19.721 --> 21:22.390
I really like it. Can I get it?

21:22.441 --> 21:25.560
Yes. Absolutely.

21:25.628 --> 21:27.061
And you know what?

21:27.113 --> 21:29.697
What?

21:29.765 --> 21:32.484
Your grandma would have
loved you in this suit.

21:32.551 --> 21:34.369
Just no bullfighting, okay?

21:34.420 --> 21:36.838
No problem. Bullfighting is caca del toro.

21:36.905 --> 21:38.640
Okay.

21:38.707 --> 21:40.842
Hey, mama.

21:40.909 --> 21:43.344
You're pretty when you smile. I missed it.

21:45.345 --> 21:46.421
Thanks buddy.

21:52.054 --> 21:53.921
Are you ready?

21:53.973 --> 21:55.940
My whole life, my hair's
been out to get me,

21:56.025 --> 21:58.493
like it resents my forehead
for taking up too much room.

21:58.561 --> 22:00.145
Stop. You look nice.

22:00.212 --> 22:02.263
Maybe I should wear a hat.

22:02.314 --> 22:05.650
Like a beret. Or a fez.

22:06.752 --> 22:09.237
The movie is great.

22:09.288 --> 22:11.456
And you are great.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.442
And you look so handsome

22:14.493 --> 22:17.245
that we need to get out of this bedroom,

22:17.296 --> 22:19.330
or you're gonna miss your premiere.

22:20.583 --> 22:22.783
What would I do without you, Brooke Davis?

22:22.835 --> 22:25.837
Well, for starters, you'd wear a fez.

22:25.921 --> 22:27.839
Not okay.

22:27.907 --> 22:29.624
Come on.

22:29.675 --> 22:31.959
Your dad and your destiny are waiting.

22:44.690 --> 22:46.090
Thank you.

22:46.158 --> 22:48.776
Welcome.

22:48.828 --> 22:53.414
Uh, when my son Julian called me

22:53.482 --> 22:58.036
and asked me if I wanted
to make a movie with him,

22:58.120 --> 23:03.424
I thought it might be a
nice chance to reconnect.

23:03.492 --> 23:06.794
But that was that was
wishful thinking on my part,

23:06.846 --> 23:11.449
because I was gone so often
while he was, uh, growing up

23:11.517 --> 23:15.854
that we never really
connected in the first place.

23:15.938 --> 23:18.173
And that's a shame.

23:20.676 --> 23:24.195
Whenever I finish a movie,
I... I have this expression...

23:24.280 --> 23:26.581
"let's kick it out of the nest...

23:26.649 --> 23:29.033
and see if it flies."

23:29.118 --> 23:32.871
Well, son, we kicked you out of the nest.

23:32.955 --> 23:36.908
And it has been a
pleasure watching you soar.

23:38.527 --> 23:40.295
I hope you all agree.

23:45.668 --> 23:47.835
I'll see you in a bit.

24:00.349 --> 24:02.350
Julian. It's starting.

24:02.401 --> 24:05.386
Yeah, I know. I think I'm
just gonna wait till it's over.

24:08.057 --> 24:10.608
Those were some nice things
your father said about you.

24:10.693 --> 24:12.944
Yeah.

24:13.028 --> 24:14.696
You sure you don't want
to come back inside?

24:14.747 --> 24:17.732
Yeah, but you should go
watch it with an audience.

24:17.783 --> 24:20.835
I want you to see how good you
are as an actor and a writer.

24:22.338 --> 24:24.205
I was in good hands.

24:24.256 --> 24:26.741
And everything's gonna be okay.

24:26.792 --> 24:27.959
You know why?

24:28.043 --> 24:30.712
Because it already is.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.934
Opened with a sex scene.
Nice work, Polanski.

24:36.018 --> 24:38.019
Good luck explaining that one to the kid.

24:41.390 --> 24:43.274
You're not watching it either, huh?

24:43.359 --> 24:44.392
Nope.

24:44.443 --> 24:46.144
Were you grossed out, too?

24:48.080 --> 24:50.431
Come on. We should go get a drink.

24:52.785 --> 24:55.253
I don't get it.

24:55.321 --> 24:59.274
You made a movie with
no animation, no stunts,

24:59.341 --> 25:02.577
no cars that transform into stuff,

25:02.628 --> 25:05.079
no aliens, and no rabbits.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.414
Yes, I did.

25:06.465 --> 25:08.883
What the heck else is there?

25:08.950 --> 25:10.501
Romance?

25:10.569 --> 25:13.588
I don't think anyone wants to see that.

25:13.639 --> 25:15.506
Yeah.

25:15.574 --> 25:19.126
I'm not sure anyone
wants to buy it, either.

25:19.178 --> 25:20.545
Here.

25:20.612 --> 25:22.230
It helped my mom.

25:22.297 --> 25:25.400
It's good luck. You're gonna need it.

25:25.467 --> 25:28.820
What do you know? You're 6,
and you're drinking at a bar.

25:30.939 --> 25:32.440
7.

25:32.491 --> 25:34.475
Nice.

25:34.526 --> 25:38.229
Nice work, el borracho.

25:38.297 --> 25:41.949
I'll tell you something I am sure of.

25:42.001 --> 25:43.468
We're all afraid.

25:43.535 --> 25:48.456
Some of us find ways to hide
that fear, and some of us don't.

25:48.507 --> 25:50.375
But we've all got "it," you know?

25:50.459 --> 25:52.260
And it's always there.

25:52.327 --> 25:54.495
And what's your "it," Elise?

25:54.546 --> 25:55.930
What are you afraid of?

25:55.997 --> 26:00.568
I'm not afraid of anything. I have you.

26:00.636 --> 26:02.770
You were good in that scene.

26:04.973 --> 26:07.025
I'm tired of being afraid.

26:18.203 --> 26:20.955
It's still packed in there,
so at least nobody left.

26:21.022 --> 26:22.156
That's good, right?

26:22.207 --> 26:23.691
What's happening on-screen?

26:23.742 --> 26:25.893
Hold on. I'll check.

26:33.836 --> 26:35.035
They're kissing.

26:35.087 --> 26:36.654
They've been doing a lot of that.

26:36.722 --> 26:39.474
Seriously, you could have
used a robot or something.

26:39.541 --> 26:41.959
I think it's almost over.

26:42.027 --> 26:43.378
It is.

26:43.445 --> 26:44.846
Right about...

26:44.897 --> 26:45.880
Now.

26:47.266 --> 26:48.733
They're clapping!

26:57.076 --> 26:58.960
They liked it! Come on!

27:27.162 --> 27:28.646
Good news.

27:28.713 --> 27:30.464
The screening went great,
and we have buyers interested.

27:30.531 --> 27:31.865
The best of the bunch
are on their way down.

27:31.917 --> 27:33.217
I got you a beer.

27:33.301 --> 27:36.186
Now, look... no matter
what their initial offer is,

27:36.254 --> 27:37.872
I think we can get them up to $4 million.

27:37.939 --> 27:39.089
That sounds great.

27:39.174 --> 27:41.091
Just let me do the talking, all right?

27:42.677 --> 27:44.845
I won't say a word.

27:44.896 --> 27:46.063
$2.5 million.

27:46.147 --> 27:47.281
Deal!

27:51.770 --> 27:53.187
3.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.822
And a haircut for the kid.

27:56.491 --> 27:57.658
Deal.

28:01.529 --> 28:04.498
Josh, this movie firmly
establishes you as a leading man.

28:04.565 --> 28:05.883
You and Alex have amazing chemistry.

28:05.951 --> 28:09.286
Is it because you're
together in real life?

28:09.371 --> 28:11.505
Well...

28:11.572 --> 28:15.409
actually, there's something
everyone should know.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.760
We're not together.

28:18.380 --> 28:21.165
The thing is...

28:26.521 --> 28:31.442
I... I'm just excited about how many hot
single women are gonna love this movie.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.129
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

29:04.884 --> 29:06.317
Nice!

29:23.000 --> 29:26.136
Is this the V.I.P. snow fort?

29:26.136 --> 29:27.804
You don't have to check on me. I'm fine.

29:27.888 --> 29:28.921
I'm not.

29:28.972 --> 29:30.923
I needed fresh ice...

29:30.974 --> 29:33.810
For my cocktail.

29:39.987 --> 29:43.466
Jump, jump, jump.

29:47.108 --> 29:47.928
What's up?

29:48.709 --> 29:50.960
Damn, it's cold.

29:51.044 --> 29:53.112
Anybody seen my coat?

30:39.203 --> 30:43.222
Bear!

30:43.290 --> 30:45.658
Do you think it's hibernating?

30:45.709 --> 30:48.428
Nah. I think it's just passed out.

30:48.495 --> 30:51.097
Okay, here's what you're gonna do.

30:51.164 --> 30:54.133
Take this ski pole and jab it real hard.

30:54.184 --> 30:55.852
I don't want to hurt it.

30:55.936 --> 30:57.687
It's too dumb to get hurt.

30:57.771 --> 30:58.938
Trust me. Go ahead.

31:01.391 --> 31:02.742
Ow! Son of a...

31:02.810 --> 31:03.810
It talks!

31:10.067 --> 31:12.184
Aw, man.

31:20.711 --> 31:22.044
You leaving?

31:22.112 --> 31:25.331
Yeah. Thought I'd fly to Denver.

31:25.382 --> 31:27.166
What's in Denver?

31:27.234 --> 31:29.335
My parents.

31:29.386 --> 31:31.604
We need to talk.

31:31.672 --> 31:34.624
I think that's a really good idea.

31:36.126 --> 31:37.994
I hope so.

31:38.061 --> 31:40.730
Anyway...

31:40.814 --> 31:42.765
I'll see you, DuprÃ©.?

31:42.850 --> 31:45.551
It's "Whitehead."

31:47.104 --> 31:49.355
Alice Whitehead.

31:49.406 --> 31:52.057
Alice Whitehead?

31:52.109 --> 31:54.727
That's a horrible name.

31:54.778 --> 31:56.846
Shut up.

31:56.914 --> 32:00.183
Anyway, I guess we all have our secrets.

32:02.419 --> 32:05.721
Believe it or not, I'm
really gonna miss you.

32:14.748 --> 32:16.999
I'm gonna miss you, too...

32:17.067 --> 32:18.134
Alice.

33:42.636 --> 33:44.336
It's pretty magical, isn't it?

33:44.388 --> 33:46.272
It's so beautiful.

33:46.339 --> 33:48.608
This whole trip has been perfect.

33:49.218 --> 33:51.269
Well, I have to admit,
I had a little help.

33:51.354 --> 33:54.072
Last night at the bar, Jamie
gave me a gold star for luck.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.657
You want to see it?

33:55.725 --> 33:56.942
Yeah.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.013
Oh, wait... that's not it.

34:02.081 --> 34:04.282
That's the engagement ring I got for you.

34:04.367 --> 34:05.867
Where did I put that thing?

34:13.592 --> 34:16.578
Everyone says that the next thing I do,

34:16.629 --> 34:20.031
the next choice I make
is going to define me...

34:20.099 --> 34:23.702
my career... my life.

34:23.768 --> 34:25.353
Well...

34:25.420 --> 34:28.089
The next thing I want to
do is ask you to be my wife

34:28.157 --> 34:31.342
and tell you how much I love you

34:31.409 --> 34:34.312
and how nothing else matters.

34:34.380 --> 34:37.449
When I look into your eyes, Brooke,

34:37.533 --> 34:40.235
I see the rest of my life.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.904
And I see it with you.

34:50.129 --> 34:53.697
Marry me, Brooke Davis.

34:53.766 --> 34:56.351
Yes. Okay.

34:56.418 --> 34:58.920
I want to so much.

34:58.971 --> 35:02.173
I was hoping you were gonna say that.

35:15.538 --> 35:17.572
Come here.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.424
Oh, mom, you're squishing me.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.976
Oh, I'm sorry for squishing you.

35:22.028 --> 35:23.778
Let's go sledding. Do you want to?

35:23.829 --> 35:25.813
- Totally. I'll go tell everyone.
- Okay.

35:25.865 --> 35:27.949
- Dad, we're going sledding!
- All right.

35:32.438 --> 35:34.089
You okay?

35:34.156 --> 35:36.041
No.

35:36.125 --> 35:38.326
But... I will be.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.898
What do you think, Calvin?
It's a long way down.

36:18.751 --> 36:21.920
Piece of cake, Hobbes. Let's do this.

37:29.922 --> 37:33.925
It sure is a long way up, mama.

37:33.993 --> 37:36.294
No, it's just a hill.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.912
Come on.

37:37.980 --> 37:40.114
We'll climb it together.

37:59.968 --> 38:02.137
You know, I don't think
you're actually supposed to

38:02.204 --> 38:03.738
replace stuff in your hotel room.

38:03.806 --> 38:06.658
Oh, whatever. I'll be
out of here soon, anyway.

38:06.742 --> 38:08.576
Think I might get a place of my own...

38:08.644 --> 38:10.945
maybe stick around a while.

38:12.114 --> 38:15.116
Sounds kind of normal and stable.

38:15.167 --> 38:16.951
There.

38:19.121 --> 38:20.755
Perfect.

38:20.823 --> 38:21.756
Well...

38:21.824 --> 38:23.675
almost.

38:23.743 --> 38:25.794
Say you'll go out with
me, and then it will be.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.150
Okay.

38:32.218 --> 38:33.518
Yes.

38:55.174 --> 38:57.542
You know what I like best about the movie?

38:57.626 --> 38:59.344
What's that?

39:01.864 --> 39:06.501
You get the sense that they're
all gonna live happily ever after.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.672
They are.

39:27.306 --> 39:28.356
You okay?

39:30.326 --> 39:33.411
These aren't sad tears.
They're happy tears.

39:33.496 --> 39:36.431
All right, well, how about from now on,

39:36.499 --> 39:38.817
we do smiles for happy instead?

39:40.402 --> 39:41.853
What is it?

39:45.073 --> 39:46.908
I'm pregnant.

39:48.844 --> 39:51.513
I think it's gonna be a girl.

39:53.916 --> 39:54.883
Oh, my...

40:00.122 --> 40:01.422
Nice work, daddy.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.105
You're falling asleep.
Why don't you go to bed?

40:18.324 --> 40:20.592
I like it here.

40:20.659 --> 40:23.161
Yeah, I like it here, too.

40:23.229 --> 40:26.714
But you sleep like a rock,
and you're too long to carry.

40:26.782 --> 40:27.715
You're mean.

40:29.418 --> 40:33.171
You say I'm too long,
and you say I lose things.

40:33.255 --> 40:35.473
But I also love you.

40:35.541 --> 40:38.259
And the truth is that without you,

40:38.310 --> 40:40.178
I'd be the one who's lost.

40:40.246 --> 40:42.931
Nice save.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.053
I love you.

40:49.121 --> 40:50.889
I love you, too.
