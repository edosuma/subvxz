WEBVTT

00:39.607 --> 00:40.642
Can you smell?

00:53.453 --> 00:55.455
- A little spice?
- Maybe.

00:55.489 --> 00:58.425
It's not Cristal,
but it's all we've got.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.460
Didn't hurt, right?

01:01.528 --> 01:02.864
A little bit more?

01:42.804 --> 01:44.772
Are you smelling my hair?

01:45.873 --> 01:47.340
A little creepy, but...

01:58.786 --> 02:01.956
Oh, you got me!

02:01.989 --> 02:03.356
Toby.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.893
Oh, that one
freaks me out there.

03:38.152 --> 03:41.789
Well, that'll be, uh,
let's call it 82.50

03:44.926 --> 03:46.493
Where you headed?

03:46.526 --> 03:49.096
Oh, just passing through.

03:49.130 --> 03:50.998
Passing through, eh?

03:51.032 --> 03:55.036
Not much on this road but
a bunch of trees and some farms.

03:55.069 --> 03:58.371
Used to be the old highway,
you know.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.547
You on holiday?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.750
Uh, work.

04:09.784 --> 04:12.053
Not taking the family?
On your own?

04:13.955 --> 04:15.857
I'm meeting some people.

04:15.890 --> 04:18.692
It's easy to get lost
around here.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.459
You're gonna need a map.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.495
People go missing all the time.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.598
Can I just take my change?

04:34.574 --> 04:35.676
Got something for you.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.577
I've got one on my phone.

04:37.612 --> 04:39.146
Fandangled things.

04:39.180 --> 04:41.115
Better off with the real thing,
if you ask me.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.122
Let me get that for you,
darlin'.

06:24.085 --> 06:26.053
See you soon, you slut!

07:21.208 --> 07:24.311
Uh, so the moth enters
through the opening,

07:24.345 --> 07:26.914
passes through the one-way
funnel and into the collector.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.116
It's a totally harmless
catch and release.

07:29.150 --> 07:30.985
And we'll keep a few
for study, of course.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.887
It's the female of the species

07:32.920 --> 07:34.989
that passes on the genetic
mutation to the offspring,

07:35.022 --> 07:38.959
so hopefully we can stop a few
of the male children from dying.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.229
Um, uh...

07:42.263 --> 07:44.632
ultrasound, the signal,

07:44.665 --> 07:49.236
it lowers the migration path
in theory.

07:49.270 --> 07:51.972
The most important tool
in the arsenal.

07:52.006 --> 07:55.276
Like honey to a moth.

08:15.830 --> 08:17.998
Base camp has been established.

08:18.032 --> 08:20.334
Got a soft bed,

08:20.367 --> 08:22.670
barbecue, workstation,

08:22.703 --> 08:25.840
no male required.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.075
Let the hunt begin.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.335
It won't be much longer.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.369
Can I grab the book?

08:55.402 --> 08:57.338
Yeah, go on.

09:00.441 --> 09:02.676
Look at the surroundings.

09:04.145 --> 09:05.412
Here.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.757
Hey! You look hot today.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.192
What?

09:21.462 --> 09:23.731
Hey, Tobes!
Happy birthday, mate!

09:23.764 --> 09:24.798
Uh-huh!

09:26.400 --> 09:28.736
Your present's in the car.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.671
Come check it out.
Come on.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.440
What could it be?

10:00.968 --> 10:02.036
Eh?

10:02.069 --> 10:03.904
Awesome!

10:09.843 --> 10:11.178
It's cool!

11:13.073 --> 11:14.008
<i>It's cool.</i>

11:15.376 --> 11:16.410
Cool.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.515
It's a soccer ball, mate.
You gotta use your feet, huh?

11:21.548 --> 11:23.584
Watch.

11:23.618 --> 11:26.220
Ready?

11:26.253 --> 11:28.289
Huh? Now kick it back.

11:28.322 --> 11:29.356
Good job, Mom.

11:29.390 --> 11:31.125
Hey, you ready?

11:32.393 --> 11:34.261
Whoop!

11:34.295 --> 11:37.831
Gotta stay on your toes, buddy.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.300
I don't like this.

11:39.333 --> 11:44.138
I know, but have another go
for Dad, okay?

11:44.171 --> 11:47.141
Come on, mate, at least put
a bit of effort in, huh?

11:50.444 --> 11:52.212
Not bad.

11:52.246 --> 11:54.315
Now here you go.

11:54.348 --> 11:56.116
Come on, buddy!

11:56.150 --> 11:58.152
How about I go get
one of the other presents?

11:58.185 --> 11:59.320
Okay.

11:59.353 --> 12:00.587
Yeah, Mom's got it down.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.058
Well, you're not listening,
all right?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.492
Just put a bit into it.
Ready? Watch.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.485
Well, there goes
the grant budget.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.677
It looks like the pupa's been
eaten straight out of the cocoon

14:35.710 --> 14:38.479
by some kind of predator.

14:38.512 --> 14:40.615
A wild dog, maybe.

14:40.648 --> 14:42.316
Eww.

15:04.438 --> 15:07.307
Stay away from the camera, Doc.

15:54.856 --> 15:57.357
<i>Mom, come! We gotta go!</i>

15:58.559 --> 15:59.727
<i>Mom!</i>

19:12.086 --> 19:13.721
Where's the food?

20:54.722 --> 20:57.625
Camp's been destroyed.

20:57.658 --> 20:59.694
Finds missing this time.

20:59.727 --> 21:01.696
Couldn't have been a roo.

21:01.729 --> 21:03.664
So it looks like I might have
made a friend.

21:37.164 --> 21:38.565
Look.

21:38.598 --> 21:42.770
Opodiphthera mutantis.

21:42.803 --> 21:45.072
It's just beautiful.

21:45.106 --> 21:49.076
It's an endangered species.

21:49.110 --> 21:51.979
Just you all alone out here.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.188
Where is it?

22:48.636 --> 22:51.172
God!

23:19.734 --> 23:22.670
I'm sorry!

23:22.703 --> 23:24.872
I'm so sorry!

25:46.113 --> 25:48.883
- Oh, God.
- Thank God. Are you okay?

25:48.916 --> 25:50.451
What the hell
are you doing here?

25:50.484 --> 25:52.319
Seriously? You're not
answering your phone,

25:52.353 --> 25:53.721
and you're out here
in the middle of nowhere.

25:53.754 --> 25:54.889
I was worried sick about you.

25:54.922 --> 25:56.423
I don't need your help.

25:56.457 --> 25:58.926
Running away will not
solve our problems.

25:58.959 --> 26:00.961
You're pregnant.
We need to take care of you.

26:00.995 --> 26:04.331
My knight in shining armor.

26:04.365 --> 26:06.700
We're worried.

26:06.734 --> 26:09.236
We?

26:09.270 --> 26:11.238
Beth's here too.

26:18.012 --> 26:19.013
Fuck.

26:35.863 --> 26:40.434
He is an asshole,
but he loves you.

26:40.467 --> 26:43.871
I'm sorry he dragged you
into all this.

26:43.904 --> 26:47.241
What are you doing out here?

26:47.274 --> 26:48.809
I'm working.

26:48.842 --> 26:51.278
No, you're not.
You're running.

26:51.312 --> 26:52.947
I am not.

26:52.980 --> 26:55.416
Then just come home.

26:58.152 --> 27:00.421
Did Jake put you up
to saying all this?

27:05.492 --> 27:09.830
I went by your house
the other day.

27:09.863 --> 27:12.499
It was so quiet.

27:12.533 --> 27:16.737
Normally I'd hear Toby
running around.

27:20.541 --> 27:24.178
Run over and give him
a big hug.

27:27.414 --> 27:30.484
I wish I could hug him now.

27:30.517 --> 27:32.519
But I can't.

27:36.490 --> 27:39.293
Just come home.

27:39.326 --> 27:41.295
Don't you need someone too?

27:44.331 --> 27:46.767
I've got everything
I need here.

28:11.158 --> 28:14.194
- You even gonna look at me?
- No.

28:34.248 --> 28:36.984
Our son is dead.

28:37.017 --> 28:39.219
We need to let it go,
accept it.

28:39.253 --> 28:42.956
You let it go, didn't you?
Very quickly.

28:42.990 --> 28:45.426
The only reason you're out here

28:45.459 --> 28:46.960
is 'cause you don't like
to lose.

28:46.994 --> 28:48.529
Well, you've lost...

28:48.562 --> 28:50.364
Yeah, mate.

28:50.397 --> 28:52.900
No, I'm out bush.
Back tomorrow.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.383
<i>So what do you think?</i>

29:09.416 --> 29:13.020
- <i>About MJ?</i>
- <i>Of course.</i>

29:13.053 --> 29:16.056
<i>She's just mourning Toby.</i>

29:16.090 --> 29:17.591
<i>It's sad.</i>

29:17.625 --> 29:19.426
<i>This is different.</i>

29:19.460 --> 29:22.529
<i>She's not processing.
She's...</i>

29:22.563 --> 29:24.398
<i>She's stuck.</i>

29:24.431 --> 29:26.166
<i>You think?</i>

29:26.200 --> 29:27.401
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:28.936 --> 29:31.606
<i>Maybe...</i>

29:31.639 --> 29:35.042
<i>Maybe you can look into it.</i>

29:35.075 --> 29:37.344
<i>She'll listen to you.</i>

29:37.378 --> 29:39.913
<i>I'll try, I'll try.
You know I will.</i>

31:12.807 --> 31:14.208
What?

31:16.811 --> 31:18.780
Oh, my God!

31:24.418 --> 31:25.753
Jake!

31:27.087 --> 31:28.388
Jake!

31:33.460 --> 31:35.229
Hey, hey, what's wrong?
What is it?

31:35.262 --> 31:37.598
There was something
on the roof!

31:37.632 --> 31:40.267
Okay, okay, it was a...

31:40.300 --> 31:42.336
It was just probably a possum
or something, all right?

31:44.806 --> 31:46.573
Hey, hey, hey.

31:55.516 --> 31:56.618
Come on.

32:00.822 --> 32:02.289
Possum.

32:28.115 --> 32:29.784
Um, what are you doing
with my gear?

32:29.817 --> 32:32.319
- You're coming home with us.
- No! I need to finish this.

32:32.352 --> 32:34.254
You're pregnant.
I'm gonna take care of you.

32:34.288 --> 32:38.392
Hey, we are gonna go home
and sort this out.

32:38.425 --> 32:39.861
I'm not leaving without you.

32:39.894 --> 32:41.595
Can you please stop acting
like you give a shit?

32:41.629 --> 32:43.397
MJ!

33:04.418 --> 33:07.588
You can't walk away
every time I try to talk to you.

33:09.556 --> 33:11.558
What do you want to say?

33:18.165 --> 33:21.301
Jesus.

33:25.773 --> 33:26.874
Wait!

33:26.908 --> 33:28.308
Great!

33:37.184 --> 33:38.251
Ohh...

33:56.269 --> 33:57.504
I can't see anything.

33:57.537 --> 34:00.642
I'm telling you, I saw it.

34:00.675 --> 34:02.910
Don't look at me like that.

34:05.847 --> 34:07.247
It was right here.

34:43.784 --> 34:45.719
- What is it?
- Shh.

34:45.753 --> 34:47.286
It's a shelter.

34:52.827 --> 34:54.862
What, you think food's
gonna make it appear?

34:54.896 --> 34:56.664
Shh.

34:56.697 --> 34:58.298
Ridiculous.

35:14.749 --> 35:16.818
How much longer
are we gonna be in here?

35:19.754 --> 35:21.723
What is it?

35:28.963 --> 35:31.398
Scared the shit out of...

36:10.838 --> 36:12.572
Hey!

36:15.643 --> 36:17.577
Oi!

36:17.612 --> 36:18.846
Get back here!

36:20.447 --> 36:21.783
Jake!

36:49.811 --> 36:52.445
- Is everything okay?
- He's bleeding pretty badly.

36:52.479 --> 36:55.049
I've gotta stitch it up.
We're too far from a hospital.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.718
Is he gonna die?

36:57.752 --> 36:59.419
I don't know.

36:59.452 --> 37:01.722
Don't leave me alone
with that thing again.

37:03.958 --> 37:06.459
- Hey.
- Oh, it's fine.

37:09.030 --> 37:10.832
Shouldn't we call the police?

37:10.865 --> 37:12.667
My phone went missing
yesterday.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.135
Mine too.

37:14.168 --> 37:15.803
I thought you said
it was sedated.

37:15.837 --> 37:18.505
I've given him
half a bottle of ether.

37:18.538 --> 37:20.708
And then what?

37:20.741 --> 37:23.376
Hey, hey.

37:46.499 --> 37:48.769
She's still in there.

37:48.803 --> 37:50.838
You left her alone with it?

37:52.039 --> 37:53.608
He's sleeping.

37:53.641 --> 37:55.176
For now.

37:55.209 --> 37:58.411
I think I've given him
the right amount this time.

37:58.445 --> 38:00.547
MJ, this isn't a puppy
you can just adopt.

38:00.580 --> 38:02.116
What do you want me to do,
take him out the back

38:02.149 --> 38:03.718
and put a bullet in his head?

38:03.751 --> 38:06.053
We wait until he's
well enough to move,

38:06.087 --> 38:07.554
and then we'll take him
to a hospital.

38:07.587 --> 38:11.524
Is it even human?
I mean, look at it.

38:11.558 --> 38:13.094
What is it, exactly?

38:13.127 --> 38:15.963
Be glad you can't see it.

38:15.997 --> 38:18.633
He's just a sick boy!

38:22.937 --> 38:25.572
Hey.

38:25.606 --> 38:26.741
Hey.

38:28.075 --> 38:29.610
Here. Come on.

38:29.644 --> 38:31.846
That's okay.

38:31.879 --> 38:32.880
Come on.

38:38.185 --> 38:39.754
It's okay.

38:40.821 --> 38:41.989
It's okay.

38:53.834 --> 38:55.803
Want some of this?

39:30.171 --> 39:31.205
Mmm!

39:31.238 --> 39:32.773
Smell good?

39:36.243 --> 39:37.778
It's good.

39:51.926 --> 39:53.861
You want some more?

39:53.894 --> 39:54.996
Hmm?

40:12.179 --> 40:14.749
Shh, shh.

40:14.782 --> 40:16.549
It's okay, it's okay.

40:18.853 --> 40:21.689
Shh, shh, it's okay.

40:38.873 --> 40:41.075
Good boy.

40:54.321 --> 40:58.325
When I was down the road before,
I think I saw an old farm.

41:00.261 --> 41:04.165
Yeah, I saw it on the way up.
I think it's abandoned.

41:04.198 --> 41:08.602
Well, if there is someone home,
perhaps they can help.

41:10.337 --> 41:13.207
What do you say?

41:13.240 --> 41:15.910
I don't want leave him alone.

41:15.943 --> 41:17.912
Well, Beth can stay with him.

41:17.945 --> 41:20.114
I am not staying
with that thing.

41:24.151 --> 41:26.087
Hey.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.189
I'm trying to help.

41:28.222 --> 41:30.758
Believe me.

42:49.837 --> 42:50.938
Jake, get off him!

42:50.971 --> 42:53.107
Jake, you're hurting him!

42:53.140 --> 42:54.675
Get off of him!

42:59.246 --> 43:01.182
What is wrong with you?

43:04.018 --> 43:05.953
Just a sick boy, huh?

43:13.861 --> 43:14.862
I'm sorry.

43:39.053 --> 43:41.422
I know you're scared,
but I'm not gonna hurt you.

43:47.294 --> 43:49.430
Can you understand
what I'm saying?

43:52.399 --> 43:54.935
I knew you could.

43:59.573 --> 44:01.442
Are you cold?

44:07.014 --> 44:08.349
It's just a blanket.

44:14.888 --> 44:16.323
There we go.

44:19.126 --> 44:20.928
Where are your parents?

44:27.001 --> 44:29.069
I'm just gonna clean this, okay?

44:41.949 --> 44:43.884
So this might sting
just a little bit.

44:50.057 --> 44:51.825
There we go.

45:33.434 --> 45:34.368
Beth!

45:35.536 --> 45:36.604
They're gone!

45:36.638 --> 45:38.572
- Where?
- He took her.

45:48.916 --> 45:50.217
Mary Jane!

45:54.555 --> 45:56.190
Watch your step.

45:56.223 --> 45:57.191
One more.

46:02.296 --> 46:03.330
Shit.

46:09.169 --> 46:10.337
Come on.

46:26.286 --> 46:27.988
No.

46:29.624 --> 46:31.191
We're going in circles.

46:31.225 --> 46:32.493
Oh, my...

46:40.134 --> 46:41.201
Come on.

46:47.341 --> 46:49.176
Oh, where have you guys been?

46:49.209 --> 46:51.979
Us? Where the hell were you?

46:52.012 --> 46:53.480
I just went to check
the catches.

46:53.514 --> 46:56.950
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

46:56.984 --> 46:58.485
- I set him free
- You what?

46:58.519 --> 47:00.988
- It was cruel.
- So you let it go.

47:01.021 --> 47:04.024
MJ, that thing could be out
there now just watching us.

47:16.270 --> 47:17.639
He caught it himself.

47:25.245 --> 47:27.381
Let me cut these up for you.

47:30.752 --> 47:32.119
Eat some veggies too.

48:15.062 --> 48:16.029
Where are they?

48:17.431 --> 48:19.266
This fucking thing
stole my keys!

48:21.401 --> 48:23.638
You fucking stole my keys!
You wanna...

48:25.272 --> 48:27.441
Don't you ever
touch him again!

48:31.178 --> 48:32.212
Come on.

48:43.357 --> 48:45.058
It's okay, it's okay.

48:45.092 --> 48:47.294
Calm down. Shh.

48:47.327 --> 48:49.731
Shh. Hey.

48:49.764 --> 48:52.432
He's not gonna hurt you anymore,
I promise. Hey!

48:52.466 --> 48:55.135
Shush! Shush!

48:55.168 --> 48:57.304
Shh, shh.
It's okay, it's okay.

48:57.337 --> 49:00.608
Hey, baby, hey.

49:00.642 --> 49:02.476
Hey, it's okay.

49:04.278 --> 49:05.813
It's okay.

49:07.147 --> 49:08.850
Where are you going?

49:08.883 --> 49:11.619
She stopped listening to me
a long time ago.

49:11.653 --> 49:13.621
So you're just gonna abandon
your child again?

49:13.655 --> 49:15.690
She's isn't herself!

49:25.700 --> 49:28.168
We can help her,

49:28.201 --> 49:33.173
but we have to get her
away from that thing first.

49:33.206 --> 49:35.375
What are you suggesting?

49:38.880 --> 49:41.716
I'll take care of it,

49:41.749 --> 49:44.652
but I need you to distract MJ.

49:44.686 --> 49:46.253
No, no.

49:48.856 --> 49:52.225
You know, this isn't normal,
right?

49:57.665 --> 50:02.269
I love your sister,

50:02.302 --> 50:04.237
even if she doesn't
believe it.

50:07.942 --> 50:11.211
But I can't lose her
or our baby.

50:15.650 --> 50:17.351
Help me.

50:20.922 --> 50:22.422
Okay, okay.

51:09.937 --> 51:12.205
The mother duck's eggs hatched.

51:12.239 --> 51:14.842
Such beautiful babies.

51:14.876 --> 51:17.411
But one of them
wasn't like the others.

51:17.444 --> 51:21.849
He was different,
and they called him ugly.

51:21.883 --> 51:24.317
The ugly duckling
left his home

51:24.351 --> 51:29.657
and found some wild flocks
of ducks and geese.

51:29.691 --> 51:32.694
But life was very hard
out there,

51:32.727 --> 51:36.329
and every day was
a struggle to survive.

51:36.363 --> 51:40.835
The ugly duckling watched
as men hunted the other birds.

51:42.937 --> 51:47.709
But one day, he came across
a family of swans,

51:47.742 --> 51:49.844
and they were so beautiful,

51:49.877 --> 51:52.479
and he wanted to join them.

51:52.512 --> 51:56.516
He flapped his little wings,
but he couldn't fly.

51:56.550 --> 51:59.620
The ugly duckling
spent the entire winter

51:59.654 --> 52:01.856
hiding in caves by the lake.

52:03.590 --> 52:07.829
But finally spring arrived,
and the swans returned,

52:07.862 --> 52:09.630
and he approached them.

52:09.664 --> 52:11.799
He was scared.

52:11.833 --> 52:14.334
He thought
they wouldn't want him.

52:14.367 --> 52:18.405
But they welcomed him
with open wings.

52:18.438 --> 52:20.742
And he was shocked.

52:20.775 --> 52:25.579
He peered down into the lake
and saw his reflection.

52:25.613 --> 52:27.849
He wasn't ugly.

52:27.882 --> 52:32.620
He'd grown into
a beautiful swan.

52:32.653 --> 52:35.690
The ugly duckling
spread his wings

52:35.723 --> 52:38.325
and flew away
with his new family.

52:46.901 --> 52:48.568
Do it.

52:59.781 --> 53:01.916
Hey. Hey, what's wrong?

53:01.949 --> 53:04.652
I've lost my locket,
the one that mom gave me.

53:04.685 --> 53:06.888
I think it was down
by the creek, I don't know.

53:06.921 --> 53:08.990
Okay, okay.

53:09.023 --> 53:11.525
Please help me.

53:11.558 --> 53:13.661
Yeah, I have to grab a torch.

53:13.694 --> 53:15.897
- It won't take long.
- Okay, okay.

53:20.635 --> 53:21.936
Here.

53:36.684 --> 53:37.985
Wait here.

54:17.825 --> 54:19.492
Are you sure it was here?

54:19.526 --> 54:21.561
Yeah.

54:34.742 --> 54:35.743
MJ!

54:53.160 --> 54:54.862
- Where is he?
- He ran off.

54:57.031 --> 54:57.965
MJ!

54:59.499 --> 55:00.968
Don't go after it.

55:10.077 --> 55:11.812
Where are you?!

55:14.081 --> 55:17.218
Come back! Please!

55:17.251 --> 55:19.552
I'm sorry! Come back!

55:23.057 --> 55:25.860
Please! Please come back!

55:28.495 --> 55:29.864
Just tell me...

55:36.938 --> 55:38.639
How could you?!

55:38.673 --> 55:40.641
How could you do that?!
He would've killed him!

55:40.675 --> 55:42.677
- What are you doing?
- How could you do that to him?!

55:42.710 --> 55:44.477
Stop! Stop!

56:07.668 --> 56:09.603
<i>Can't catch me!</i>

57:01.088 --> 57:02.589
Slow down.

57:06.360 --> 57:07.628
Slow down.

57:10.965 --> 57:12.900
Jesus! I said slow down!

57:20.741 --> 57:22.676
What the hell was that?

57:22.710 --> 57:24.278
Jesus.

57:33.654 --> 57:35.122
Miss, are you all right?

57:37.091 --> 57:39.326
Hey, hey.
Hey, wake up.

57:47.234 --> 57:50.171
Wait, what are you doing?

57:50.204 --> 57:52.907
We need to get this lady
some help.

58:08.155 --> 58:10.958
MJ, come on. MJ!

58:29.877 --> 58:31.212
What is going on?

58:50.431 --> 58:53.734
There's a light on over there.
Hopefully someone's home.

58:53.767 --> 58:55.903
- She's dead!
- Who is?

58:55.936 --> 58:57.238
What about the boy?

58:57.271 --> 58:59.907
The boy?
This woman needs our help!

58:59.940 --> 59:03.244
- You can look for him later!
- You don't care about him!

59:03.277 --> 59:06.447
Stop pretending
you never wanted him!

59:06.480 --> 59:09.717
We needed you,
and you weren't there!

59:26.233 --> 59:27.301
Almost there.

59:29.170 --> 59:30.171
Beth!

59:31.438 --> 59:32.873
Beth!

59:44.785 --> 59:45.886
Jake!

01:01:45.906 --> 01:01:47.541
Hello! Is anyone home?

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:50.511
Hello!

01:01:50.544 --> 01:01:53.047
I need some help out here.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.282
Hey, miss?
Please wake up. Miss!

01:01:56.984 --> 01:01:58.452
Hey, hey.

01:02:01.555 --> 01:02:03.357
Hey, hey.

01:02:07.294 --> 01:02:08.862
Ah, fuck!

01:02:24.411 --> 01:02:25.846
Hello?

01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:30.732
Have a drink, little lamb.

01:05:30.765 --> 01:05:32.266
What?

01:05:33.567 --> 01:05:36.704
You fainted out there
in the barn.

01:05:38.773 --> 01:05:41.074
Someone...
Someone, they...

01:05:41.108 --> 01:05:44.411
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

01:05:44.444 --> 01:05:47.481
I'm sorry I frightened you.

01:05:47.514 --> 01:05:50.284
We don't see many folk
out this way.

01:05:50.317 --> 01:05:52.620
Can't you city girls read?

01:05:52.654 --> 01:05:55.088
Sign out front says,
"No trespassing."

01:05:55.122 --> 01:06:00.460
Look here. She's just a baby.
As if she did Meg in.

01:06:00.494 --> 01:06:02.596
There's more than
one of them, moron!

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:04.632
We should be out there
looking for them.

01:06:04.666 --> 01:06:08.435
What you gonna do, run them over
with your stinking chair?

01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:12.372
We were just trying
to get help.

01:06:12.406 --> 01:06:15.475
- W-We...
- Calm down.

01:06:15.509 --> 01:06:18.579
We're just a bunch
of old girls here.

01:06:20.648 --> 01:06:21.716
Drink up.

01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:30.357
Better?

01:06:35.596 --> 01:06:38.565
Now I need you to focus,
little lamb.

01:06:38.599 --> 01:06:40.167
What happened to Meg?

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.704
Who's Meg?

01:06:44.839 --> 01:06:48.175
You said you came here
to get help.

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:52.145
Now I presume it's for the dead
woman you dumped in our barn.

01:06:52.179 --> 01:06:55.482
I-I didn't know.
It was an accident.

01:06:55.515 --> 01:06:58.485
- It was an accident.
- What kind kind of an accident?

01:06:58.518 --> 01:07:02.322
A car? I don't know.
I didn't see.

01:07:02.356 --> 01:07:03.858
I didn't see it.

01:07:07.695 --> 01:07:10.497
Don't lie to me, little lamb.

01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:13.200
Give that back!
Give it back, please!

01:07:13.233 --> 01:07:15.335
Please give that back!
I don't know!

01:07:15.369 --> 01:07:17.605
Don't know, eh?

01:07:17.639 --> 01:07:20.842
We just wanna know
what happened, okay?

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:23.945
Who was there?

01:07:23.978 --> 01:07:26.614
How many people?

01:07:28.382 --> 01:07:31.451
Why won't you look me in the eye
and tell me?

01:07:31.485 --> 01:07:33.688
What have you got to hide?

01:07:33.721 --> 01:07:36.724
She's got the pox.

01:07:36.758 --> 01:07:38.826
Like the young'uns.

01:07:40.394 --> 01:07:42.496
Please explain.

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:51.806
Bad stock.
Can't see nothing.

01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:53.306
Let her go.

01:07:55.509 --> 01:07:58.746
I'm sorry. Like I said,
we don't get many visitors.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.882
Some of us forget our manners.

01:08:11.726 --> 01:08:13.560
What do you see?

01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:17.631
What do you see?

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:23.004
Little lamb, you're defected.

01:08:23.037 --> 01:08:26.607
What does that mean?

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.508
I'm so sorry.

01:08:30.877 --> 01:08:32.613
Get away from her!

01:08:32.647 --> 01:08:36.917
I said get away from her!

01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:40.420
Just a bunch of old girls here.

01:08:40.453 --> 01:08:42.622
Why don't you put down
that reaper,

01:08:42.657 --> 01:08:45.358
and we can discuss this
like civilized citizens?

01:08:45.392 --> 01:08:49.897
Or are we just a bunch of
country bumpkins to you?

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:52.432
Come on, relax.

01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:54.533
Someone in your condition
should be taking it easy.

01:08:56.604 --> 01:08:59.674
How far along are you?

01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:02.810
Is the man who came with you
the father?

01:09:03.978 --> 01:09:06.613
I just want my sister.

01:09:09.515 --> 01:09:12.486
My sister. Now!

01:09:14.354 --> 01:09:16.991
You killed my sister,
didn't you?

01:09:18.826 --> 01:09:20.795
You killed our sister

01:09:20.828 --> 01:09:23.831
and then came here
demanding yours.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.301
How dare you.

01:09:29.703 --> 01:09:30.772
Enough!

01:10:10.912 --> 01:10:11.846
Oh, shit.

01:10:23.024 --> 01:10:26.093
Hey, buddy, you okay?

01:10:26.127 --> 01:10:28.763
Have you seen two women?
One's blind...

01:10:28.796 --> 01:10:29.864
Shut up.

01:11:15.943 --> 01:11:17.778
Beth! Beth!

01:11:17.812 --> 01:11:19.914
Beth, Beth.

01:11:26.187 --> 01:11:28.055
It's okay.

01:11:31.458 --> 01:11:34.762
What do you think they're gonna
do to us, MJ?

01:11:37.131 --> 01:11:39.767
It's gonna be okay.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.768
I promise.

01:11:43.738 --> 01:11:45.572
I'm sorry.

01:11:45.606 --> 01:11:47.775
I shouldn't have lied to you.

01:11:51.012 --> 01:11:52.980
And the boy...

01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:59.086
He really was just a boy,
wasn't he?

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.856
And me and Jake,
we treated him like an animal.

01:12:36.891 --> 01:12:37.959
Hi.

01:12:48.803 --> 01:12:51.939
- What is it? What is...
- Shh, shh!

01:12:54.742 --> 01:12:57.812
Oh, good boy, good boy.

01:13:02.616 --> 01:13:04.852
Come on, come on.

01:14:00.708 --> 01:14:02.643
Hope she got
your motor running.

01:14:04.845 --> 01:14:07.081
You're gonna need it.

01:14:07.114 --> 01:14:09.216
Eeeny...

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:11.619
meeny...

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.122
miney...

01:14:15.156 --> 01:14:17.224
moe!

01:14:17.258 --> 01:14:19.093
Who am I kidding?

01:14:19.126 --> 01:14:20.895
You're up, pretty boy.

01:14:26.867 --> 01:14:28.335
Get in!

01:14:31.138 --> 01:14:32.239
Fuck!

01:14:33.674 --> 01:14:36.143
Stay down!
Gimme it! Gimme it!

01:14:43.684 --> 01:14:45.686
♪ High hopes ♪

01:14:45.719 --> 01:14:48.989
♪ I've got high hopes ♪

01:14:49.023 --> 01:14:51.258
♪ She's got high hopes ♪

01:14:51.292 --> 01:14:53.060
Quit it with the tunes!

01:14:53.094 --> 01:14:54.862
Ugh!

01:15:08.676 --> 01:15:10.277
Oh, fuck me.

01:15:21.889 --> 01:15:23.924
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:15:23.958 --> 01:15:27.294
Jesus has got nothing to do
with this place.

01:15:32.032 --> 01:15:34.101
Where's my wife?

01:15:35.836 --> 01:15:38.672
Maybe you can
clear this up for me.

01:15:38.706 --> 01:15:41.308
Who killed our sister Meg?

01:15:43.244 --> 01:15:45.913
It was an accident, all right?
We were coming here for help.

01:15:45.946 --> 01:15:48.282
So I was right.

01:15:48.315 --> 01:15:50.351
It was the woman.

01:15:50.384 --> 01:15:52.720
She didn't mean to.

01:15:52.753 --> 01:15:55.022
Her...

01:15:55.055 --> 01:15:57.091
We just lost our son.

01:15:58.392 --> 01:16:00.828
All Father wanted was a son.

01:16:06.867 --> 01:16:09.870
All right, lady, I don't care
what's going on here.

01:16:09.904 --> 01:16:13.841
I promise you if you let us go,
we will not tell anyone.

01:16:13.874 --> 01:16:15.809
Was your boy healthy?

01:16:20.047 --> 01:16:21.448
Yes, of course.

01:16:21.482 --> 01:16:23.784
Was he blind?

01:16:23.817 --> 01:16:24.919
What?

01:16:24.952 --> 01:16:27.054
Your wife has a blind sister.

01:16:27.087 --> 01:16:29.256
Was your boy blind?

01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:32.860
No.

01:16:32.893 --> 01:16:34.328
So despite
a defective gene pool,

01:16:34.361 --> 01:16:37.464
you fathered a normal boy.

01:16:37.498 --> 01:16:38.899
How did he die?

01:16:38.933 --> 01:16:40.201
Where's my fucking wife?

01:16:40.234 --> 01:16:42.102
How did he die?

01:16:45.039 --> 01:16:46.473
It was a car accident, okay?

01:16:46.507 --> 01:16:49.310
It was car accident,
just like your sister.

01:16:55.316 --> 01:16:57.985
You lost your boy.
That must've killed you.

01:17:02.489 --> 01:17:07.294
Please, just... tell me.

01:17:07.328 --> 01:17:09.363
Is my wife...

01:17:14.034 --> 01:17:17.338
All Father wanted
was a male heir.

01:17:17.371 --> 01:17:20.374
But he kept churning out girls.

01:17:20.407 --> 01:17:22.843
Useless girls.

01:17:22.876 --> 01:17:26.780
We promised him a boy.

01:17:26.814 --> 01:17:28.816
But Father was defective.

01:17:30.417 --> 01:17:33.087
And so are we.

01:17:51.372 --> 01:17:54.441
Do you know what it's like to
let down someone who needs you?

01:17:54.475 --> 01:17:58.979
To make promises
you can't keep?

01:18:05.953 --> 01:18:08.022
I never wanted my son.

01:18:10.858 --> 01:18:12.993
I never wanted
my beautiful little boy.

01:18:16.096 --> 01:18:18.565
I wasn't ready.

01:18:22.903 --> 01:18:24.505
Drink.

01:18:33.447 --> 01:18:34.515
Get ready.

01:18:34.548 --> 01:18:36.950
Father's still waiting.

01:18:47.528 --> 01:18:53.167
There's a track winding back
from his asshole to his crack.

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:08.916
Are you still creeping
round here, boy?

01:19:08.949 --> 01:19:12.286
You are a stain
on your good father's name!

01:19:22.062 --> 01:19:23.030
Oh, shit.

01:20:06.373 --> 01:20:08.308
You little shit.

01:20:15.983 --> 01:20:16.950
Come here.

01:20:16.984 --> 01:20:18.085
Feel this?

01:20:19.453 --> 01:20:21.488
Untie him.

01:20:35.035 --> 01:20:36.470
Beth!

01:20:48.716 --> 01:20:51.351
Step one, two, three.

01:20:52.519 --> 01:20:53.454
Wait!

01:20:56.557 --> 01:20:58.726
There's others. Other men.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.561
- Jake...
- Come on.

01:21:00.594 --> 01:21:01.729
Okay, watch your head.

01:21:10.237 --> 01:21:12.139
Shit.

01:21:17.411 --> 01:21:19.246
Hurry. You're free.

01:21:24.518 --> 01:21:26.119
Come on! Come on.

01:21:26.153 --> 01:21:27.454
- Jake, come on, let's go.
- Fuck.

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:45.740
- Shit!
- I'm sorry!

01:21:45.773 --> 01:21:47.642
That's okay.
It's not your fault.

01:21:47.675 --> 01:21:49.109
- Okay, go.
- I'll get...

01:21:49.142 --> 01:21:50.477
Go to the car.
The boy will help me.

01:21:50.511 --> 01:21:52.212
It's not your fault,
okay? Go.

01:21:52.246 --> 01:21:54.348
Go. The boy will help. Go!

01:21:54.381 --> 01:21:56.550
Hey, you just go
straight ahead.

01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:58.318
I'm right behind you, okay?
