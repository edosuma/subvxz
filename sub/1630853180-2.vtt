WEBVTT

01:33.885 --> 01:34.010
- Get out of my way!

01:36.763 --> 01:37.806
Bastard!

01:38.473 --> 01:39.516
Wait, bastard!

01:42.977 --> 01:45.730
- Help!
A guy with knife is chasing me.

01:45.814 --> 01:46.731
- Get out of my way!

01:46.815 --> 01:48.024
- Lower the knife!

01:48.107 --> 01:49.859
- I'll kill you!
- Lower the knife!

01:49.943 --> 01:50.902
- He's a pervert!

01:50.985 --> 01:52.821
- I can explain.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.906
I'm a reporter from the Meicho.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.659
- Then why were you asking
my wife

01:57.742 --> 01:59.202
about her panties?

02:54.632 --> 02:56.384
- Excuse me, I'd like

02:56.467 --> 02:58.386
to make an appointment
to see your listing in Shibuya.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.265
- Miss, acquiring
property in Tokyo

03:02.348 --> 03:04.559
is a very complicated endeavor.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.519
- Yes, I'm aware of that.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.313
Could we set an appointment
for tomorrow?

03:08.855 --> 03:12.901
- I'm afraid there are many
steps that must be taken.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.987
- I've taken those steps.
I'd like to see the space.

03:16.738 --> 03:20.241
- I'm afraid
the owner of that space

03:20.325 --> 03:23.077
wouldn't be interested
in renting to you.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.830
- I see...

03:25.914 --> 03:29.375
Then I'll find someone who is.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.793
Thank you for your time.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.796
- The wire service reported

03:33.880 --> 03:35.924
this panty thief
in Kabukicho yesterday,

03:36.007 --> 03:37.508
and Maruyama-san wants
two paragraphs on it

03:37.592 --> 03:40.762
for the evening edition,
but so far, I have nothing.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.388
I've been running
around Kabukicho all morning

03:42.472 --> 03:43.890
asking women
about their panties,

03:43.973 --> 03:45.058
and I almost got killed.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.477
- I have not slept in two days.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.479
- Yeah, but you got
a story published, right?

03:49.562 --> 03:51.189
- About traffic safety.
- Still a story.

03:51.272 --> 03:56.402
Every one I turned in, nope.
Tears apart.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.862
Meanwhile, I got my own story.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.489
It's better than any
of this stuff.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.994
You remember that guy who set
himself on fire in Shinjuku?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.038
- Hmm. Yeah.

04:07.121 --> 04:11.501
- I think that he's connected
to that stabbing I covered.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.795
- And by covered, you mean
wrote up as a murder

04:13.878 --> 04:17.423
so Baku almost fired you?

04:17.507 --> 04:20.134
"Gaijin! Gaijin!"

04:20.218 --> 04:22.470
- You like busting my balls,
huh?

04:22.553 --> 04:24.639
It is the great joy of my life.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.933
- All right.

04:27.016 --> 04:31.437
I gotta go. Clock's ticking.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.338
- Hey, Pol.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.131
- I have emergency.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.341
- Are you stuck
at Akira's again?

05:00.425 --> 05:02.343
Rat bastard can't put you
in a fucking cab?

05:02.427 --> 05:05.680
- Stop.
He is love of my life.

05:05.763 --> 05:08.224
I need help to pick a birthday
present for one of my regulars.

05:08.307 --> 05:11.936
- Kimchi breath guy?
- No, Hasegawa-san.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.479
- Oh.
Hairy eyebrows, close talker.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.564
- Yes.

05:14.647 --> 05:18.192
I buy him good present,
he buy champagne all night.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.569
Please, I beg you.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.654
You have taste
that is so good.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.363
- Sure. I gotta stop by Onyx.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.365
I'll meet you in Shibuya
at00?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.784
- What are you doing now?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.870
Fuck!
- I gotta go. I'll meet you.

05:31.456 --> 05:35.543
- I've been chased by worse
than a man with a knife.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.045
It's a hazard of the job.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.130
- I understand that,
Maruyama-san.

05:39.213 --> 05:42.633
I just need a little more time.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.428
- You have until00 p.m.
No later.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.890
- I-I-I-I don't have the lead.
I don't have anything.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.476
Everyone I speak to, they don't
know shit about this and--

05:51.559 --> 05:53.061
- Jake, Jake.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.854
Stop walking.

05:56.814 --> 06:00.568
Now, step back and think.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.445
Who else can you go to?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.335
- Miyamoto-san.

06:17.418 --> 06:18.961
- "I just have to have to say

06:19.045 --> 06:21.297
I find your dress
extraordinarily flattering."

06:21.380 --> 06:23.674
- It worked, right?
That was a good line, right?

06:23.758 --> 06:25.259
- Yeah.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.761
- Hey, no one knows
Kabukicho like you, right?

06:26.844 --> 06:28.429
- Well, true.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.097
- Do you know anything
about this panty thief?

06:29.180 --> 06:31.307
- Panty thief?

06:31.390 --> 06:33.309
- Do you know anything?

06:33.392 --> 06:35.686
'Cause I've been writing this
story and I--I got no leads.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.942
- I shouldn't tell you this,

06:41.025 --> 06:44.153
and if you quote me,
I'll deny it.

06:44.237 --> 06:44.779
- Okay.

06:44.862 --> 06:49.033
- There's no panty thief.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.785
- Really?

06:50.868 --> 06:54.080
- Some ladies lost
their underwear to a windy day.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.665
Wire service wrote it up

06:55.748 --> 06:59.961
because papers love a story
about a pervert.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.546
- Thank you. Wait, wait.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.714
Anyone else know about this?
- No one yet.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.383
Thank you, thank you.

07:05.466 --> 07:05.800
Thank you.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.677
Miyamoto-san.

07:29.991 --> 07:30.992
- Rewrite it.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.160
- Yes. Will do.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.013
- Rewrite it.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.524
No good.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.716
- Alright, you worthless
piece of shit.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.387
Let's try this again.

08:35.264 --> 08:39.644
You're crossing the street,
minding your own business,

08:39.727 --> 08:43.856
when this jogger comes out of
nowhere and slams into you...

08:46.817 --> 08:48.069
And?

08:48.152 --> 08:49.195
What then?

08:50.571 --> 08:51.781
- What do you want me to say?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.494
- The truth. In your words.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.463
The victim had an accidental
run-in with a thug.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.006
Wrong place, wrong time.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.425
- Funaki, you don't really
believe that.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.221
- We have his prints on the
knife and a signed deposition.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.306
What more do you want?

09:18.474 --> 09:19.892
- A low level Tozawa goon
just walks in off the street

09:19.976 --> 09:20.935
and gives himself up?

09:21.018 --> 09:22.770
Feels like the fastest way
to kill an investigation.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.689
- Investigation?

09:25.356 --> 09:28.609
Our job is to clear cases.

09:30.027 --> 09:30.528
This is going in.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.452
- That's the third shop
in the last month.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.789
All under our protection.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.834
- Tozawa.

09:46.043 --> 09:49.630
- He's trying to prove
we can't protect our territory.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.466
We have to hit back.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.096
- And risk war?

09:57.888 --> 10:00.057
- But this is war.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.560
- We hit back,

10:02.643 --> 10:04.353
Chikara-kai will be seen
as the instigators,

10:04.437 --> 10:07.857
and the cops
will come down on us.

10:08.983 --> 10:09.483
Are you idiots?!

10:12.737 --> 10:15.656
No. No retaliation.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.660
For now, we increase
protection fees.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.958
We use the extra money
to close ranks and prepare.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.337
Kume...

10:29.420 --> 10:30.421
- Hai.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.505
- Kobayashi...

10:31.589 --> 10:31.672
- Hai.

10:32.715 --> 10:36.177
- If a war is coming
with Tozawa, we'll be ready.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.102
- Oyabun likes them
chopped fine.

10:45.603 --> 10:50.399
Tip stays on the board,
one smooth motion...

10:51.400 --> 10:52.902
- Damn, Sato.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.905
You think

10:55.988 --> 10:57.740
maybe you went
into the wrong business?

10:59.992 --> 11:03.120
Hope you're as good with
that knife outside the kitchen.

11:06.874 --> 11:07.792
- Should we go find out?

11:11.629 --> 11:11.712
- Sato.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.469
Go make the rounds.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.721
- They've already paid
this month.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.224
- Now they're paying more.

11:24.767 --> 11:24.850
- Okay.

11:34.485 --> 11:34.777
Don't fuck up the onions.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.249
- That bad, huh?

11:48.707 --> 11:50.459
- Be quiet.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.384
You need to stop using
so many adjectives.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.721
- Okay.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.101
It will run in
the morning edition.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.941
- Really?

12:14.024 --> 12:16.068
- You show initiative,
and this is real news.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.945
Keep it up.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.825
- Not bad, Jake-san.

12:22.908 --> 12:23.993
- That's my first article, man.

12:24.076 --> 12:24.702
Yeah, I know.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.919
Why do I feel like the greatest
investigative journalist

12:34.003 --> 12:35.463
that ever lived?

12:35.546 --> 12:37.298
Because you're an American,

12:37.381 --> 12:39.800
so you think you're more
talented than you actually are.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.802
- That's right.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.474
Or maybe I'm just lucky.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.526
What time do we have to be back
at the Meicho for Ko-etsu?

12:57.610 --> 13:02.531
About 90 minutes.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.582
Hey. We all have to do it.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.501
It's the final check, Jake.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.505
You can't be late. Hey!

14:00.673 --> 14:03.217
- Considering the evidence,

14:03.300 --> 14:05.928
and now this confession,
we expect an easy conviction.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.890
I hope this will bring
you and your family

14:09.974 --> 14:11.350
some measure of comfort.

14:21.902 --> 14:25.573
- Forgive me if this is
too painful to revisit but...

14:26.657 --> 14:28.075
I understand,

14:28.158 --> 14:29.076
from the statement
you gave Detective Funaki

14:29.159 --> 14:31.120
that your husband
was having financial problems.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.291
- I went through all this
with the other detectives.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.210
They didn't seem
to think it was relevant.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.211
- Of course.

14:40.170 --> 14:46.343
I'm just following up to ensure
nothing's been overlooked.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.641
- We borrowed.

14:53.559 --> 14:53.809
Too much.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.605
We missed one payment

14:57.688 --> 14:58.772
and the interest rate
became ten times higher.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.776
So my husband pushed back.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.194
- How so?

15:05.029 --> 15:09.408
- He was gathering information
to bring to a lawyer.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.578
About these lenders
and their...

15:12.661 --> 15:14.246
methods.

15:15.205 --> 15:19.126
- Do you happen to have
that information?

15:25.424 --> 15:26.675
- Yes.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.027
- May I help you?

15:46.612 --> 15:49.573
- My name is Jake Adelstein.
I'm with the Meicho Shimbun.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.994
- I'm sorry, I've been asked
not to speak with the press.

15:54.411 --> 15:55.954
- Really?

15:56.038 --> 15:58.082
But...

15:58.165 --> 16:00.167
just a few minutes is enough.

16:00.751 --> 16:01.543
May I have some of your time?

16:01.627 --> 16:02.961
- I'm afraid I have company...

16:11.512 --> 16:13.681
"Takahiro Aoki has borrowed
a large amount of money.

16:13.764 --> 16:17.101
"How do you feel
about a dirtbag like him

16:17.184 --> 16:18.852
living in your neighborhood?"

16:29.196 --> 16:31.532
- Well, then,
can I ask you one--

16:31.615 --> 16:34.076
- I have nothing to share.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.124
- I will come again.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.545
I'm sorry for bothering you.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.465
Once again,
my deepest condolences.

17:46.648 --> 17:47.941
- Hey, he looks like
real yakuza, right?

17:51.278 --> 17:52.738
- Wanna play?

18:01.538 --> 18:03.749
- He's gonna kill this.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.598
- Got you!

18:19.681 --> 18:20.724
You have two lives left.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.684
Reload!

18:22.768 --> 18:24.561
Got you!

18:24.645 --> 18:25.938
You have one life left.

18:28.148 --> 18:31.026
Got you! You're dead!

18:39.284 --> 18:40.953
- With my humble regards.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.898
- Oh!
- Ooh.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.150
- Oh sorry, I didn't expect--
- Malee.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.526
- Usually no one is here
so early.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.068
- What are you doing here?

19:55.152 --> 19:56.904
- I forgot my hair brush.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.572
- Malee, hurry up.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.073
I don't have much time today--

20:07.205 --> 20:07.956
- Ah,

20:08.040 --> 20:10.918
here's that hairbrush
that you forgot.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.961
Why don't you wait outside?
I'll give you a ride home.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.591
Classy.

20:19.676 --> 20:23.722
She's bad with customer,
so I give her lessons.

20:27.851 --> 20:30.604
Bitches who meddle
get sent back to America.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.523
- Don't fucking threaten me.
I have a work visa.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.400
- Try to fuck with me,

20:35.484 --> 20:37.235
I make one phone call,
and you're out of here.

20:37.319 --> 20:40.197
- And I walk out of here
with ten of your best girls.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.657
How will your business be then?

20:41.740 --> 20:42.199
Huh, Duke?

20:51.750 --> 20:52.125
- Go home, Samantha.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.366
- Where'd you go, Mossad?

21:24.449 --> 21:26.576
- Ah, had to make a quick stop
to fuck your mother.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.329
- What?

21:29.413 --> 21:31.206
Y-you fucked my mother?

21:33.500 --> 21:35.460
Jake-san, why did you do that?

21:35.544 --> 21:37.212
- No, not really.
In America, we--

21:38.880 --> 21:42.009
I got him.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.845
Those things stink.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.138
- They're French.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.307
- French people stink too.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.600
- That is not true.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.894
The French have
very good hygiene.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.939
Renaissance Europeans,
especially French aristocrats,

21:56.023 --> 21:58.859
believed that taking a bath--
- Okay, Tin-Tin.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.028
- Right.
- Tin-Tin.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.112
- I see that.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.364
- It's pronounced "Tahn-Than,"

22:04.448 --> 22:05.866
and he is Belgian.

22:05.949 --> 22:08.452
- Belgian, French,
same fucking thing.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.037
- First of all,
Belgium is a monarchy,

22:10.120 --> 22:11.288
and France is a republic.

22:11.371 --> 22:14.458
Okay, Tin-Tin.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.669
- Fuck you. Trendy Haiyu.

22:17.753 --> 22:18.503
Oh!

22:18.587 --> 22:19.921
A trendy actor, yeah?

22:20.005 --> 22:22.174
You got nice hair,
like an actor's.

22:25.844 --> 22:26.887
Gaijin!

22:27.637 --> 22:28.638
- Hai.

22:32.851 --> 22:33.518
- Read this. Out loud. Now.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.561
- Yes.

22:34.978 --> 22:38.398
Underwear thief...captured...

22:45.030 --> 22:48.200
- Today at30 p.m.,

22:48.283 --> 22:50.994
the Shinjuku police arrested an
office worker, age forty-one,

22:51.078 --> 22:52.913
a resident of Shinjuku-ward
Kabuki-cho Block 1,

22:52.996 --> 22:55.373
on charges of theft.

22:56.249 --> 22:59.503
The police raided his apartment
and found

22:59.586 --> 23:03.548
400 pairs of women's underwear,

23:03.632 --> 23:07.094
color-coded and sorted.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.183
But according to you,
there is no underwear thief.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.858
We can't trust you
to report one simple story.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.993
That's why you're shit.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.162
Go to scrapbooking.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.205
You're done here.

23:35.288 --> 23:35.330
- Hai.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.512
- Last time I checked,
Katagiri,

23:50.595 --> 23:52.305
loan sharks don't kill people,

23:55.225 --> 23:57.936
because dead men pay no debts.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.729
- You don't find it suspicious?

24:00.939 --> 24:03.817
That just before filing
a lawsuit against the lender,

24:03.900 --> 24:05.485
the man is murdered
by a low-level yakuza?

24:08.864 --> 24:10.740
- We've been
down this road before.

24:11.366 --> 24:11.992
Or don't you remember?

24:12.075 --> 24:16.288
- Ohara-san, this is different.

24:16.371 --> 24:17.747
- Sure.

24:17.831 --> 24:18.498
The difference is this case

24:18.582 --> 24:21.334
has a deposition,
a murder weapon,

24:21.418 --> 24:23.545
and a violent criminal
behind bars.

24:23.628 --> 24:23.962
It's closed.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.979
- Cream. Too much sugar.

24:41.062 --> 24:42.522
How you like it.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.317
Thanks.

24:46.484 --> 24:48.653
- Don't take it personal.

24:48.737 --> 24:49.446
He's just...

24:49.529 --> 24:52.115
Racist nationalist.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.119
You've got those too, right?

24:58.288 --> 25:01.750
Things could be worse.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.543
You could be living
in Missouri.

25:04.252 --> 25:07.714
That's true.

25:07.797 --> 25:08.715
- Move.

25:08.798 --> 25:09.841
- Sorry.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.262
- Get a solid story

25:14.346 --> 25:15.388
in the paper,
or this is your last paycheck.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.234
- It does have armadillo on it.

25:27.317 --> 25:32.197
I think armadillo looks stupid,
but it's Hasegawa's favorite.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.240
He says it's only animal
with armor,

25:33.323 --> 25:36.201
so it's like samurai
of animal world.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.289
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I boring you?

25:41.373 --> 25:43.625
- No, I'm fascinated
by armadillos.

25:45.794 --> 25:48.296
- I know, I know.
But it looks expensive, right?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.090
I cannot afford more than this.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.258
- Why is that?

25:53.301 --> 25:55.845
- What? What?
Should I be like you?

25:55.929 --> 25:57.639
Save everything
and have no fucking fun?

25:57.722 --> 26:00.475
- Look, if you want to blow
your money on Akira,

26:00.558 --> 26:02.185
that's your business.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.691
- Something's wrong.
What's wrong?

26:11.861 --> 26:13.488
- It's nothing.
I'm tired.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.743
- All right,
I'm going to get this.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.210
- Yeah. You heard me.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.296
I said shut up.

27:11.379 --> 27:14.674
What part of that
don't you understand?

27:14.758 --> 27:16.217
Shut the fuck up! Right now!

27:18.136 --> 27:21.473
- No...no...don't you...
don't you look at me!

27:21.556 --> 27:25.060
Did you hear me!

27:25.143 --> 27:27.645
Don't you fucking look at me!

29:50.788 --> 29:52.457
- Check out Yuta!

29:55.168 --> 29:56.669
Looks like he needs
to take a dump!

29:58.379 --> 30:00.840
- Fuck you. Fuck all of you.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.218
- I'm back.

30:07.805 --> 30:09.098
Please check these.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.899
- Who's short?

30:18.858 --> 30:22.862
- Duke.
Said he'd have it next month.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.535
- All that money going through
the club every night,

30:28.618 --> 30:30.203
he can't cough up
an extra hundred thousand?

30:33.623 --> 30:36.543
You're sure he didn't offer you
house credit in the meantime?

30:38.086 --> 30:38.962
Some shit about how,
"You could have

30:39.045 --> 30:40.713
a good time here
with the girl of your choice?"

30:46.928 --> 30:47.804
What the fuck
are you looking at?

30:49.138 --> 30:50.139
- Sorry.

30:51.432 --> 30:54.310
- Don't ever lie to me again.

31:00.608 --> 31:01.818
- All I'm saying is,

31:01.901 --> 31:03.361
your father could help you

31:03.444 --> 31:05.572
get a great newspaper job
near us.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.407
Maybe in St. Louis.

31:07.490 --> 31:08.950
- I have a job already,
and it's for one

31:09.033 --> 31:09.909
of the best newspapers
in the world.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.411
- Then at least come home
for a visit.

31:11.494 --> 31:14.038
We miss you.
- I know.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.873
I miss you guys, too,
but I can't come home right now

31:15.957 --> 31:16.583
because I just started.

31:16.666 --> 31:19.544
- Joshua, we are your family.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.087
It's-it's nice
that you called,

31:21.170 --> 31:24.090
but we have not seen you
for three years.

31:24.173 --> 31:26.509
Your sister needs you.

31:26.593 --> 31:30.013
Her treatments--they aren't
working anymore.

31:30.096 --> 31:32.015
- Ma, Jess is fine.
Can you trust me on that?

31:32.098 --> 31:33.766
But I have to go.
I love you so much. Bye.

31:41.524 --> 31:42.984
- You owe me a story.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.492
- How much did you pay
for the information I gave you?

31:53.036 --> 31:54.370
- Nothing.

31:54.454 --> 31:57.415
- Yeah, and that's
what it was worth.

31:57.498 --> 31:58.833
It's transactional.

31:58.916 --> 32:02.962
Nothing is free.
Everybody's for sale.

32:03.046 --> 32:06.132
Right now, you are treating me
to a nice steak dinner,

32:06.215 --> 32:10.470
so I'm treating you
to my years of wisdom.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.515
If I don't get a real story

32:14.599 --> 32:15.516
as soon as possible,

32:15.600 --> 32:15.808
I'm gonna get fired.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.402
- There's an old

32:26.486 --> 32:28.863
Japanese saying.

32:28.946 --> 32:30.615
Kishi Kaisei.

32:32.200 --> 32:32.909
- Kishi Kaisei.
- Mm.

32:32.992 --> 32:36.120
- Wake from death,
return to life.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.374
What's that supposed to mean?

32:39.457 --> 32:40.333
- It means...

32:41.876 --> 32:44.087
Don't be such a pussy.

32:51.552 --> 32:52.553
What?

32:54.305 --> 32:55.682
Now's the time to ask.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.891
While you are paying for it.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.861
- Do you know anything
about this?

33:17.578 --> 33:21.207
- Looks like some
financial services firm.

33:21.290 --> 33:22.166
Why?

33:22.250 --> 33:24.585
- Well, I'm trying to
figure out who they are.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.046
- You call the number?
- Yeah, it's disconnected.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.465
- Then why ask me?

33:38.266 --> 33:39.100
So good.

33:42.854 --> 33:42.895
- Excuse me.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.481
- Coming.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.025
Yes?

33:48.109 --> 33:48.901
- Another of everything.

33:51.154 --> 33:54.198
And an extra serving
of short ribs.

33:54.282 --> 33:56.200
- Extra serving.

33:57.493 --> 33:58.578
- Delicious, eh?

34:02.790 --> 34:03.916
- I'll be right back.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.084
I gotta take a leak.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.008
- Excuse me.

34:13.509 --> 34:14.594
- You're leaving?

34:26.856 --> 34:28.107
- We're busy today, huh?

34:33.237 --> 34:34.781
Cute tie!

34:51.130 --> 34:52.298
Hurry up, will you?

34:52.381 --> 34:53.424
- Sorry.

34:58.554 --> 34:59.972
- You okay?

35:00.431 --> 35:02.433
- Listen--

35:02.517 --> 35:03.351
- Hey!

35:04.644 --> 35:06.437
What the fuck
are you sitting down for?

35:06.521 --> 35:07.438
Table 7.

35:07.522 --> 35:08.523
Go!

35:10.983 --> 35:12.485
- Listen.

35:12.568 --> 35:16.447
Laugh, be who they want,
and take their money.

35:17.573 --> 35:18.825
- Okay.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.284
- I'll handle Duke.
You got this.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.624
- Where's my Imperial Brut?

35:26.707 --> 35:29.168
I've been waiting a while.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.044
- One moment.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.173
- She's so pretty,

35:34.257 --> 35:36.175
but she forgets their names,
their drinks.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.679
- I'm working with her.
We can't all be as good as you.

35:39.762 --> 35:41.681
- That is true.

35:41.764 --> 35:44.350
Give me the rundown.

35:44.433 --> 35:45.685
- First-timers.

35:45.768 --> 35:48.187
The skinny guy
is the fat wallet.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.523
As soon as you see me pour out
the last of this bottle--

35:50.606 --> 35:51.357
- I'll swing by and see

35:51.440 --> 35:54.068
if Mr. Fat Wallet
wants another bottle.

36:07.748 --> 36:10.710
- Excuse me, here's the check.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.050
- Mm.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.477
- Let's raise our glasses.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.983
- Excuse me. Samantha,
you are being requested.

36:34.066 --> 36:36.986
- All right.
If you'll excuse me...

36:37.069 --> 36:42.199
I'm very sorry.
Here's Nana instead.

36:52.710 --> 36:53.794
- Hey.

36:56.422 --> 36:57.173
- I got that second bottle.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.639
- The hostess always pours.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.557
- Mm-hmm.

37:06.641 --> 37:10.603
- You never touch the bottle.
It's my job.

37:10.686 --> 37:11.187
- Mm-hmm.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.942
- And if you smoke...

37:16.025 --> 37:18.486
We light your cigarette.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.074
Do you smoke?

37:26.744 --> 37:27.703
- No.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.455
- You will.
- Oh.

37:29.538 --> 37:32.375
- And we fold things.
- Uh-huh.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.461
- Lots of linen folding.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.546
- How often do you rotate
between the tables?

37:39.131 --> 37:40.883
- Every 30 minutes.
- Mm.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.510
- You're spending money
right now.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.221
Is this really what you want
to talk about?

37:45.304 --> 37:48.975
- Absolutely. I have time.
Who's this girl over there?

37:51.227 --> 37:52.645
- Akiko.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.230
She's been here the longest.

37:54.313 --> 37:55.648
Classy as they come.

37:55.731 --> 37:56.774
Only deals with
long-term regulars.

38:02.571 --> 38:04.198
And who's that?

38:06.075 --> 38:08.953
- That's Luna.
She's our star.

38:09.036 --> 38:10.621
She's really very good.
You'd like her.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.331
- I think so.

38:16.210 --> 38:21.048
Uh, the guy who just walked in,
who's that?

38:24.093 --> 38:25.928
- That blonde girl, Samantha.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.179
- Sure. This way.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.265
- Someone you and your notebook

38:29.348 --> 38:30.641
should stay away from.

38:30.725 --> 38:31.392
Will you excuse me
for a moment?

38:39.442 --> 38:41.777
- She will be right with you.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.404
Excuse me.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.408
You have a customer.
You know what to do.

39:05.634 --> 39:07.053
- You came alone this time.

39:11.474 --> 39:14.602
Gives us a chance to chat.

39:17.813 --> 39:18.981
Finally.

39:43.380 --> 39:47.468
You're a glutton
for punishment, aren't you?

39:49.178 --> 39:52.181
- You should see the other guy.

39:52.264 --> 39:53.933
- Why?
What happened to him?

39:56.018 --> 39:59.271
- Nothing.
He's my aniki.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.442
- Tattoo...

40:04.068 --> 40:05.903
Cool kicks.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.322
- Thanks.

40:10.199 --> 40:12.409
Dunks?
- Yeah.

40:12.493 --> 40:13.661
- Dunks are shit.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.246
- What?
You mind if I join?

40:15.329 --> 40:18.415
You think Bapes are cooler
than Dunks?

40:18.499 --> 40:21.877
This is the--this is
the real McCoy right here.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.462
This came first, you know?
That's a copy.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.551
- He doesn't
understand fashion.

40:28.634 --> 40:29.593
- I understand fashion.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.971
I just know, is that fashion,
or is it stealing?

40:32.054 --> 40:36.267
- Jake--this is Sato.

40:36.350 --> 40:39.103
He's not as brooding
as he seems.

40:39.186 --> 40:42.606
Sato-san, this is Jake.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.985
He's not as annoying
as he seems.

40:50.656 --> 40:51.532
Excuse me...

40:52.575 --> 40:53.367
- Hey!

40:57.079 --> 40:58.164
- She's always leaving, man.

41:02.793 --> 41:05.171
- What?

41:05.254 --> 41:08.799
- Why is that gaijin
in Sato's booth?

41:08.883 --> 41:10.301
- It's fine.
I figured it out.

41:10.384 --> 41:12.094
I have it under control.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.017
- But these are Wrangler.
You know Wrangler?

41:18.100 --> 41:19.727
From America.

41:19.810 --> 41:20.269
Amer--like a cowboy.

41:20.352 --> 41:23.022
- Uh-huh. 501 Levi's.

41:23.105 --> 41:24.440
- Yeah.
- Leather patch.

41:24.523 --> 41:25.524
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

41:25.608 --> 41:26.775
- Yeah.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.235
- We got one
of their machines.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.696
Now we make and sell, uh...

41:31.113 --> 41:32.239
Counterfeit.

41:32.907 --> 41:33.949
Yeah.

41:34.033 --> 41:34.366
You can't tell the difference.

41:36.952 --> 41:37.703
- Really?

41:37.786 --> 41:38.370
- Uh-huh.

41:38.454 --> 41:39.455
- That's genius.

41:43.584 --> 41:46.045
I could write about that.

41:46.128 --> 41:49.006
- Yes.
- Yeah?

41:49.089 --> 41:50.507
- But then
I'd have to kill you.

42:13.656 --> 42:15.991
- Ah, shit.
- What's up?

42:16.075 --> 42:18.827
- I'm going to miss my train.
I gotta go. Damn.

42:18.911 --> 42:23.832
Hey, listen,
it's been illuminating.

42:23.916 --> 42:26.585
I'll see you around.
- Later.

42:44.353 --> 42:46.313
- This is today's last train.

42:46.397 --> 42:50.776
This is today's last train.
Please hurry.

42:51.151 --> 42:54.822
This is today's last train.
Please hurry.

43:22.182 --> 43:23.350
- Hey.

43:23.434 --> 43:24.560
- Hey.
- I missed my train.

43:28.564 --> 43:30.524
- Don't worry.
You can have it.

43:30.607 --> 43:31.900
- Yeah?

43:31.984 --> 43:32.693
- I have to go
to a detective's house

43:32.776 --> 43:35.863
and wait outside
until he comes home.

43:51.754 --> 43:53.797
- You know, Jake,

43:53.881 --> 43:56.675
I was so happy to get this job

43:56.759 --> 43:57.760
until it started.

44:08.854 --> 44:10.564
- When I was a kid,

44:10.647 --> 44:14.735
my family used to get two
newspapers delivered every day.

44:14.818 --> 44:18.405
And I remember one day
asking my dad at breakfast

44:18.489 --> 44:21.116
while he was reading the paper,

44:21.200 --> 44:24.953
"What's in there?
What's so important?"

44:25.037 --> 44:27.706
And he said, "Every day,

44:27.790 --> 44:32.044
"the knowledge of the world
increases a little bit,

44:32.127 --> 44:35.005
and this newspaper
is a record of that."

44:39.635 --> 44:41.678
So that's what we get to do.

44:41.762 --> 44:44.390
We get to increase the
world's knowledge every day.

44:48.310 --> 44:50.145
- By emptying ashtrays?

44:50.229 --> 44:50.771
- He didn't mention that.

45:00.989 --> 45:03.992
- Some company for the night.

45:04.076 --> 45:06.829
- Thanks.

45:08.497 --> 45:08.622
Hang in there.

45:48.162 --> 45:49.538
- Hello.

45:49.621 --> 45:52.249
Is this tape being listened to
by Joshua

45:52.332 --> 45:55.127
"I want to call myself
Jake now" Adelstein,

45:55.210 --> 45:57.504
the big brother who never
sends tapes to his sister?

45:57.588 --> 46:00.466
This is tape 23
from me to you,

46:00.549 --> 46:04.470
which officially
totally makes you a loser

46:04.553 --> 46:06.513
and yet I forgive you.

46:06.597 --> 46:09.183
Why? Because I'm awesome.

46:09.266 --> 46:11.852
Speaking of awesome,
as of last Saturday,

46:11.935 --> 46:14.146
I have my driver's license.

46:14.229 --> 46:16.732
Does this scare you?

46:16.815 --> 46:18.692
Well, try being Mom and Dad.

46:18.775 --> 46:20.694
When I ask to borrow
the car now,

46:20.777 --> 46:23.113
they look like they're going
to throw up from fear

46:23.197 --> 46:27.993
at the same time
in the same toilet.

46:28.076 --> 46:30.996
That made you laugh, right?
I know you.

46:31.079 --> 46:33.707
All those cool Japanese people
you're hanging with,

46:33.790 --> 46:36.668
they don't know you
half as well as I do.

48:19.730 --> 48:19.855
- Who's that?

48:22.357 --> 48:22.858
- No one.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.807
- This is an urgent
announcement

48:55.891 --> 48:57.017
from the Police Department.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.727
An organized crime incident

48:58.810 --> 49:00.729
has been reported
in the Shinjuku precinct.

49:00.812 --> 49:02.689
Possibility of crime involving
the use of firearms or knives.

49:02.773 --> 49:05.150
Effective for Shinjuku,
Yotsuya,

49:05.233 --> 49:06.735
and Harajuku precincts.

49:07.277 --> 49:08.945
Crime scene located
at Kabukicho,

49:09.029 --> 49:11.698
District 4, Lot 1,
Building 2, IDS building...

49:41.561 --> 49:43.021
- Shut the fuck up!

49:47.776 --> 49:49.528
Try me if you got the balls.

49:49.611 --> 49:52.280
I'll fucking shoot you!

49:52.364 --> 49:53.907
- Nakamura, put the gun down!
- Don't, Nakamura.

49:55.617 --> 49:56.618
- Wait.

49:58.453 --> 49:59.830
We--we can talk about it.

50:00.455 --> 50:01.748
Please, let me explain.

50:03.208 --> 50:05.669
This is who you pay
to protect you?

50:06.795 --> 50:08.380
These Chihara-kai punks

50:08.463 --> 50:11.508
can't protect shit!

50:13.135 --> 50:14.553
Listen.

50:14.636 --> 50:18.765
We go where we want,
we drink where we want!

50:18.849 --> 50:21.393
This district, this city...

50:21.476 --> 50:22.978
belongs to Tozawa now.

50:25.522 --> 50:27.607
You tell Ishida that.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.819
- Just shoot him.

50:34.322 --> 50:36.700
- Fuck it.

50:39.494 --> 50:41.788
- Nakamura!

51:08.690 --> 51:09.858
Nice watch.

51:14.029 --> 51:14.070
- Thanks.

51:15.822 --> 51:16.740
From Hong Kong.

51:18.116 --> 51:19.576
Looks as good as a real one.

52:16.049 --> 52:16.132
Hey.

52:26.810 --> 52:29.479
Meicho reporter...I see.

52:32.858 --> 52:33.900
Your camera.

52:53.253 --> 52:55.797
Don't write about this.

52:56.131 --> 52:56.256
You hear me?

52:58.216 --> 52:59.801
- Hai.
