WEBVTT

00:08.609 --> 00:10.144
-(water splattering)
-Sorry, Dad,

00:10.178 --> 00:12.012
but it looks like
I've conquered you at Risk,

00:12.046 --> 00:13.714
-bankrupted you at Monopoly...
-HOMER: Hmm. Hmm.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.883
...and aggravated you
at Aggravation.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.318
Well, with you as a daughter,

00:17.351 --> 00:19.153
I'm a winner
in the game of Life.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.721
Although, I lost that, too.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.690
(grunts) Such a good father.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.725
Everyone is really
getting along.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.760
What the hell is going on?

00:26.794 --> 00:28.829
There's no Bart.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.831
-You're right.
-Where is he?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.400
Ladies, relax.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.535
Remember when I said
I'd punish Bart

00:34.568 --> 00:37.871
after he got us...
banned from the buffet?

00:37.905 --> 00:39.273
(Bart chuckles)

00:40.908 --> 00:42.843
I can't shut it off.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.880
Someone wedged a seasonal
Tuscan focaccia in the lever!

00:46.914 --> 00:48.382
(laughs)

00:48.416 --> 00:51.852
Well, Homie, whatever punishment
you gave him must have worked.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.256
Yep, tough love. I'm his father,
not his best friend.

00:55.289 --> 00:58.426
He'll hate me now, but someday
he'll say wonderful things

00:58.459 --> 01:02.029
about me to people on airplanes
who just want to go to sleep.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.698
-That young man will...
-How did you punish him?

01:04.732 --> 01:07.801
Well, I sat the boy down,
looked him straight in the eye,

01:07.835 --> 01:11.105
and bought him a top-of-the-line
computer gaming rig.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.441
-You what?
-I get it. You bribed him.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.743
Stay out of this.
I did not bribe him.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.279
I addicted him to something
that will numb his spirit

01:18.312 --> 01:20.781
until he's no longer
our responsibility.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.651
Well, it has been
pretty peaceful around here.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.787
Kill! Die! Die!
Get wrecked, newbs!

01:26.820 --> 01:29.957
(dramatic music playing)

01:29.990 --> 01:31.659
This is General Splattin'.
Do you copy?

01:31.692 --> 01:33.227
-Copy.
-BOTH: Copy.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.728
Jinx. You me a Coke.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.231
(groans) I'll never be able
to pay that bet.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.599
Focus, Nelson, focus.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.568
Kite the enemy into a gank.
Squeeze it...

01:40.601 --> 01:42.903
-on three... two...
-(explosion)

01:42.936 --> 01:44.104
GG!

01:44.138 --> 01:45.606
That means "good game."

01:45.639 --> 01:49.310
It's how the other team
lets you know... they surrender!

01:49.343 --> 01:50.944
HOMER:
Mm.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.581
Now I hit control-six
to defile their corpses.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.915
Haw-haw! Haw-haw!

01:54.948 --> 01:57.117
-Haw-haw!
-(chickens clucking)

01:58.186 --> 02:00.188
(dance music plays)

02:03.491 --> 02:05.259
Civilized annihilation.

02:05.293 --> 02:08.296
Marge, the boy just may be
learning some life skills.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.298
Mom, do you agree with this?

02:10.331 --> 02:13.100
I guess so. Your father
is showing an interest in Bart,

02:13.133 --> 02:14.302
which is good.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.936
Well, if that's how things work,

02:15.969 --> 02:17.838
then I'm gonna
behave badly, too.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.773
(both laughing)

02:19.807 --> 02:22.510
-That's great!
-Sure you are.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.946
I'll show you! I'm gonna...
tear up my homework.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.481
(Lisa groans)

02:27.515 --> 02:30.951
I'm really gonna do this.
Here I go.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.955
(groans) Actually, this
bibliography could be improved.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.524
(Lisa humming a tune)

02:36.557 --> 02:38.992
-(typing)
-Island of the Blue Dolphins.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.362
Ibid. Ibid. Ibid. Ibid.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.631
Op cit. Ibid. Ibid. Ibid.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.499
Ibid. Ibid. Ibid.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.501
(shower running)

02:47.535 --> 02:50.003
Bart's been in the shower
for an hour.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.905
(chuckles)
With a young man that age,

02:51.939 --> 02:55.209
there's only one reason
he's in the bathroom that long.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.678
Skunk sprayed him good.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.381
Oh, my God, he's playing
with himself!

03:00.414 --> 03:01.815
On that game.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.652
He's playing that game
in the shower?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.387
We have to stop this right now.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.921
Homer, take care of your son.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.723
Make him quit.
(groans) Geez.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.092
Sorry, boy, I have to put
my foot down.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.327
I can't quit now.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.995
My team's about to compete
in a tournament.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.430
I can't let them down.

03:16.464 --> 03:19.199
Well, team building
is important.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.270
All right, let yourself go, and
your partner will support you.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.739
(Lenny screams, groans)

03:25.773 --> 03:27.275
Damn you, Homer!

03:27.308 --> 03:30.010
Please, Dad, can I play
in this one last tournament?

03:30.043 --> 03:31.345
Sorry, boy, you're through.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.414
First prize is a thousand bucks.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.115
You get paid
to play video games?

03:35.148 --> 03:36.350
A thousand bucks.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.118
-They actually pay you?
-Yes.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.853
-In dollars?
-Yes.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.922
-To play a video game?
-That's right.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.558
-They pay you in cash?
-Yes, yes, yes!

03:44.592 --> 03:45.959
-How much?
-A thousand!

03:45.993 --> 03:47.895
All right. Do not tell your mom,

03:47.928 --> 03:49.897
but I'm gonna say yes,
one last tournament.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.198
Oh, thank you, Dad.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.066
Just one thing--
they actually pay you?

03:53.100 --> 03:54.468
Yes!

03:54.502 --> 03:58.105
A thousand dollars
to play video games?

03:58.138 --> 03:59.940
(dramatic music playing)

03:59.973 --> 04:02.376
Group up.
Time to put these suckers away.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.845
Oh, yeah, show me some Gs,
Odgenville.

04:07.681 --> 04:11.985
We win! And it's all because
I let them do it.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.922
Now, apparently,
the Evergreen Terrors have won,

04:14.955 --> 04:17.958
uh, this thing I don't
understand at all,

04:17.991 --> 04:21.395
but which gave the school
new basketball nets.

04:21.429 --> 04:26.266
Now to hand you your prize
money, which is $1,000 cash.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.103
Let go, Seymour.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.472
I'm telling myself to.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.841
I've never held this much money
in my hand all at once.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.576
Let me just, uh... (chuckles)

04:35.609 --> 04:37.845
look at it.

04:37.878 --> 04:42.115
$100 bill, autographed
by Lawrence Summers.

04:42.149 --> 04:45.085
Such a carefree signature,
before the Great Recession.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.854
HOMER:
Mm.

04:46.887 --> 04:50.491
Here you go, $200 each. Mm!

04:50.524 --> 04:53.160
Okay, team, take a break
and meet up for practice in 30.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.262
My dad said we could all
go to Krusty Burger.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.164
Is he giving us a discount?

04:57.197 --> 04:59.032
No, he just said we could go.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.535
It'll be nice to have
some kids in there again,

05:01.569 --> 05:04.938
after what the monkey did during
that birthday party. (groans)

05:04.972 --> 05:06.874
Whatever. Just meet in 30.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You know what, kids?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.110
I'm gonna blow your minds

05:10.143 --> 05:12.446
with a little bit
of hard-earned advice:

05:12.480 --> 05:14.848
-Quit while you're ahead.
-KIDS: Huh?

05:14.882 --> 05:16.950
We can't quit. There's
so many more tournaments.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.886
You won one
video game tournament.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.888
This isn't like
baseball or politics

05:20.921 --> 05:22.322
where you can make real money.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.192
You only have one
childhood, kids. Enjoy it.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.528
Okay, but because
we came in first

05:27.561 --> 05:30.998
we qualified for a tournament
where we could win $500,000.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.800
Childhood's over.
It's time for work.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.602
(cell phone buzzing)

05:42.410 --> 05:44.645
Hmm. Hmm?

05:44.678 --> 05:45.979
That's right, sweetie.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.916
I'm going to make your brother
a champion.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.985
Knock off that racket!

05:52.019 --> 05:53.353
You're gonna defy Mom?

05:53.387 --> 05:55.423
-Sit on my knee, boy.
-I think I'm too old.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.858
You're never too old
to sit on Daddy's knee.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.760
-(bones crack)
-Ow, my knee! Get off! Get off!

05:59.793 --> 06:01.995
(groaning)

06:02.029 --> 06:03.597
Son, here's a life lesson:

06:03.631 --> 06:06.166
I don't directly tell
your mother anything bad.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.236
I secretly make her a part
of everything she's against.

06:09.269 --> 06:12.339
That's why I spent
your winnings on her.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.241
Honey, I got you a present.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.376
MARGE (gasps):
An espresso pod machine,

06:16.410 --> 06:19.012
like the one I made fun of
at the Hibberts'.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.583
Because you wanted it yourself.
Let me pod you, my dear.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.586
-(machine whirring)
-Ooh! What's the occasion?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.588
The occasion is that
I haven't been

06:27.621 --> 06:29.890
as good of a father as I should.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.693
Yes. Well, no, uh...

06:32.726 --> 06:34.094
Don't argue. It's true.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.129
I need to get more involved
in Bart's life,

06:36.163 --> 06:38.198
so I've decided to be his coach.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.434
That's wonderful. Coaching what?

06:40.468 --> 06:42.603
Oh, I haven't landed on it yet.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.072
Football, chess,
maybe even a silly video game.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.575
It doesn't matter.
Have some coffee.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.577
I love how it doesn't
fill the cup.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.812
Very European. Mmm.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.847
-It's a video game.
-What?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.719
I guess if you're spending
time together, what's the harm?

06:58.752 --> 07:01.622
(singsongy):
Look who's a dad.
Look who's a dad.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.390
I knew you'd be cool with it.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.493
Also, I hired a video game
expert to tutor Bart.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.894
His name is The Detonator.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.161
-(groans)
-(doorbell rings)

07:10.030 --> 07:13.300
"I can't make conversation
unless it's about gaming."

07:13.333 --> 07:15.836
Do you want to come in?

07:15.869 --> 07:18.839
Do you want to go where
they're playing the game?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.474
Thank you, ma'am.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.310
Homer, I've watched Bart play--
here, on his Twitch feed,

07:23.343 --> 07:25.746
and his HitForm, InstaBox,
Gibtrack, Buzuba,

07:25.779 --> 07:27.080
and YergaPunch streams.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.917
Hmm, the only word I recognized
was Gibtrack.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.285
I think Bart has what it takes
to be top ten.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.287
-Players? In the country?
-Bigger.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.156
-The galaxy?
-Smaller.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.424
-World?
-Yes.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.626
Whoo-hoo.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.761
Kids, make sure you're
in a chair that spins.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.696
You're all gonna get a lesson
from The Detonator.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.264
Let's jump into a battle.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.634
To start, Bart and Nelson,
we'll put you up front,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.636
and we'll back you up
with Sophie and Milhouse.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.037
Booyah!

07:50.070 --> 07:51.805
THE DETONATOR:
Notice my finger
is clicking the mouse

07:51.839 --> 07:52.973
with a light, quick stroke

07:53.006 --> 07:54.441
to limit joint fatigue
and tracking error.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.043
I'm clicking like
the mouse button is hot.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.945
Not too hot;
like the top of a toaster

07:57.978 --> 07:59.346
after an underdone bagel.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.482
Okay, now I'm using that quick
mouse stroke here and here,

08:02.516 --> 08:04.852
which is how, Bart,
you should drop diamonite mines

08:04.885 --> 08:06.386
to surround their spawn points.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.021
Milhouse, make sure
you're in position

08:08.055 --> 08:09.623
to respond to enemy aggression.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.392
Sophie, when they make
their move, go in and engage.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.729
My dad's been engaged 20 times.
I know what to do.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.297
Okay, now we're entering
the mid-game,

08:17.330 --> 08:19.533
where it's important to keep
focusing on major objectives

08:19.567 --> 08:20.901
and control the map.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.571
Okay, Homer, you watch the
screen while I take a quick A.P.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.805
What's an A.P.?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.807
It's a gamer abbreviation
for "a pee."

08:26.840 --> 08:28.642
Nerd lingo. Saves so much time.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.243
THE DETONATOR (over headsets):
All right, I'm walking

08:30.277 --> 08:31.478
through the kitchen,

08:31.511 --> 08:32.880
blue-haired woman
is feeding a baby.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.314
I'm making eye contact.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.317
MARGE: Your shoes have
lace holes but no laces.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.152
THE DETONATOR:
Linoleum, linoleum.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.188
Strafing into the bathroom,
gonna go into defuel mode.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.823
Lifting seat with shoe.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.658
Pro tip: Going over the belt
saves time.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.926
Shaking, flushing
and hand washing

08:45.959 --> 08:47.728
are the real time killers.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.363
Once I cut those out,
my lag time went way down.

08:50.397 --> 08:53.000
Okay, these Water Mages
have fuel tanks on their backs,

08:53.033 --> 08:54.835
so you can't hit them
with standard spells,

08:54.868 --> 08:58.371
but if I equip this staff that
lets me cast lava quadballs...

08:58.405 --> 09:02.042
I mistimed it. Oh, God,
I mistimed. They killed me.

09:02.075 --> 09:05.012
Do you mind if I dance
over your corpse?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.446
I'd be mad if you didn't.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.016
-It's over for me.
-Why?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.351
I just lost my gaming edge.
Right there, just now.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.420
Been in the zone for years,
and now I'm not.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.789

my team into winners,

09:17.791 --> 09:19.426
and I was gonna
live through them.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.028
Just yesterday, I turned 19.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.030
Made it longer than most
in this crazy biz.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.699
Anyway, I'm gonna go work for
my uncle. He owns a tile store.

09:25.733 --> 09:28.368
It'll be a good life.
Good enough.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.037
Sucks to be old.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.706
I didn't cry
at my grandpa's funeral,

09:32.740 --> 09:36.276
mostly because he was racist,
but I'm crying now.

Now it's up to me.

-Do we get uniforms?
-No. No uniforms.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.464
You're a ragtag bunch
without any sponsors

09:57.497 --> 09:59.432

rooting for you.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.669

this thing you like

10:01.702 --> 10:04.504
into something that will consume
every waking minute?

10:04.537 --> 10:06.674
-KIDS: Maybe!

I want to go to South Korea, to

there so special, so magic,

19:17.657 --> 19:20.227
We're gonna win.
Dad's crazy coaching worked.

19:20.260 --> 19:24.130
If I win, I'll be the most
famous girl gamer of all time.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.898
Also, if I lose.

19:27.166 --> 19:31.003
So beautiful. Must destroy.

PILOT:
Uh, welcome to our
19-hour-and-45-minute flight

20:23.055 --> 20:25.525
from Seoul, South Korea
to Springfield.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.695
One brief note: Our in-flight
entertainment system

20:28.728 --> 20:30.263

Zen. Remember your Zen.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.771
I'm sorry,
you're too fat for coach.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.640
We'll have to put you
in first class.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.443
Thanks to Buddha, I win again.

20:43.476 --> 20:46.379
Dad, I don't think you've quite
grasped the religion.

We don't want you anymore.
You blew it.

-Yeah, great.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.440
Wait, I've got a baby daughter.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.442
Maybe she's good
at beach volleyball.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.943
How old is she?

21:16.976 --> 21:18.445
-One.
-Too late.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.367
Shh!
