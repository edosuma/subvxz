WEBVTT

00:01.586 --> 00:03.622
Chiana:
Oh, yeah...

00:04.505 --> 00:06.370
( passionate panting )

00:08.634 --> 00:11.216
( passionate groans and gasps )

00:11.304 --> 00:12.669
( Rygel groans with
frustration )

00:12.763 --> 00:15.721
Work, fre|| you, work!

00:17.602 --> 00:18.557
Ah!

00:18.644 --> 00:20.259
Oh...

00:24.859 --> 00:27.100
(salacious snickering )

00:29.363 --> 00:30.569
(gasping)

00:30.656 --> 00:32.942
( passionate gasping
continues )

00:46.839 --> 00:48.670
Crichton:
See to me, it's unbelievable,
you know.

00:48.758 --> 00:51.249
I can come to the Mall of the
Uncharted Territories,

00:51.344 --> 00:53.084
buy anything I want,
'cause I'm rich,

00:53.179 --> 00:57.013
and that leather, S&M faced
wacko Scorpy clone,

00:57.099 --> 00:59.306
he's... he's locked in here,
so you know...

00:59.393 --> 01:00.929
(rumbling)

01:01.020 --> 01:02.260
anything, with all, you know...

01:02.355 --> 01:04.596
everything is gonna be
just fine, but no,

01:04.690 --> 01:08.399
my friend she's sick, so
we gotta find a place
where she can heal

01:08.486 --> 01:10.772
and you have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you?

01:10.863 --> 01:12.319
No.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.148
(rumbling)

01:15.243 --> 01:16.949
What the hell's going on
out there?

01:17.036 --> 01:20.073
Moordil:
Gamma disturbances are quite
common in this area.

01:20.164 --> 01:21.370
What, are you talking
like storms?

01:21.457 --> 01:22.913
Well, yes. They're no problem.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.659
D'Argo:
John!

01:23.751 --> 01:25.036
Hey, yo, Heavy D!

01:25.127 --> 01:26.708
Hey, have you tried one
of these things?

01:26.796 --> 01:30.209
They're terrible, but once you
get past the blue slime,
underneath,

01:30.299 --> 01:32.005
pure aviation fuel.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.213
Look what I got for
me and Chiana.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.760
They're union tattoos.

01:36.847 --> 01:37.882
Oh.

01:37.974 --> 01:42.513
They are burned into our skin.
-Coo|.

01:42.603 --> 01:46.095
You know, I... I never thought
I was gonna get married again.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.805
But then...

01:48.776 --> 01:49.640
What?

01:49.735 --> 01:50.770
What?

01:52.196 --> 01:53.402
Have you been talking
to Chiana?

01:53.489 --> 01:54.899
No, no.

01:54.991 --> 01:57.448
No, she's angry with me,
but once she get these...

01:57.535 --> 01:58.991
Yeah, D'Argo, look...

01:59.078 --> 02:02.320
I could be wrong, all right?
Um, probably am.

02:02.415 --> 02:04.371
She probably wouldn't, but...

02:04.458 --> 02:07.450
Chiana could say no.

02:07.545 --> 02:09.206
( laughs )

02:09.297 --> 02:11.128
How could she say no?

02:11.966 --> 02:13.172
Chiana:
No!

02:13.259 --> 02:15.295
(male voice purring )
No...

02:17.513 --> 02:19.469
No more.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.095
(grunts)

02:25.396 --> 02:27.136
This is crazy.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.186
Yeah.

02:28.274 --> 02:29.559
And creepy.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.311
Why are we in here with
these bodies?

02:31.402 --> 02:33.142
Because it's cold.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.478
Your Dad, D'Argo...

02:35.573 --> 02:37.484
D'Argo hates the cold.

02:37.575 --> 02:40.112
So he won't catch us if
he comes back early.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.444
l'm half-Luxan. I'm not crazy
about the cold, either.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.326
l'|| warm you.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.330
Take those to our vessel.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.503
Both:
Yes, your Eminence.
Thank you.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.501
Your Eminence just gave
them a 300 fenik tip.

02:54.592 --> 02:55.957
That's more than a year's wage.

02:56.052 --> 02:58.134
The servant class is never
rewarded enough.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.756
(loud rumbling)

02:59.847 --> 03:01.087
Here. Let me help you.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.173
I'm dying, Stark.
I'm not an invalid.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.553
Don't talk like that.
I've got maps here. Maps.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.805
We'll find a planet where
you can recuperate.

03:07.897 --> 03:09.637
Just buy me an intoxicant.

03:09.732 --> 03:11.643
That's all I need
to recuperate.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.146
(loud rumbling)

03:19.200 --> 03:20.906
Crichton:
She looks weaker.

03:20.993 --> 03:23.109
Yes, she does.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.661
So, what did you buy?

03:27.041 --> 03:28.406
Just some essentials.

03:28.501 --> 03:31.243
What would that be?
Floss? Lip liner?

03:31.337 --> 03:32.827
Weapons.

03:32.922 --> 03:37.461
I traded a pulse pistol for
some original Taric deployers.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.506
Cool.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.459
Borlick:
Are you Crichton?

03:45.267 --> 03:47.132
Who are you?

03:47.812 --> 03:49.177
Security.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.353
And are you Crichton?

03:51.440 --> 03:54.898
No, he's not. And we don't know
who this "Cretin" is.

03:54.985 --> 03:58.694
You know, I heard he destroyed
a Peacekeeper Gammak base,

03:58.781 --> 04:02.023
murdered an entire
Nebari battalion,

04:02.118 --> 04:05.155
even laid waste to a
Shadow Depository.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.202
(loud rumbling)

04:08.207 --> 04:09.697
The guy was a devil.

04:09.792 --> 04:12.579
He raped and pillaged,
he popped eyeballs.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.161
Whoa, whoa, where... where
do they get these stories?

04:15.256 --> 04:16.666
Let's set the facts straight.

04:16.757 --> 04:21.342
First off, there was no raping,
very little pillaging

04:21.429 --> 04:25.297
and Frau Bl cher popped
all the eyeballs.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.965
I knew you were Crichton.

04:30.187 --> 04:34.226
Look, I'm not here for
any trouble.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.854
I'm just looking for some
aviation fuel shooters.

04:40.406 --> 04:42.192
That's great.

04:42.283 --> 04:45.116
That's great because, in here,
everything's on me.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.658
We hate Peacekeepers.

04:46.745 --> 04:47.951
Hey, Moordy! Moordy!

04:48.038 --> 04:50.905
lntoxicants for Crichton
and his... his grunt.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.661
I'm not his grunt.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.332
(loud rumbling)

04:54.420 --> 04:57.537
Yeah, so... you here to kill
somebody? Can I help you?

04:57.631 --> 05:00.008
No, no, no, my grunt does
all my killing.

05:00.092 --> 05:02.208
l'm strictly R&R.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.214
(rumbling grows louder)

05:04.305 --> 05:07.012
What the hell's going on
around here?

05:08.767 --> 05:10.223
Moordil, what's the problem?

05:10.311 --> 05:12.302
Moordil:
Watch out!

05:13.063 --> 05:14.439
Stark:
Down, Zhaan!

05:15.107 --> 05:16.563
( screaming )

05:25.242 --> 05:27.619
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

05:27.703 --> 05:31.412
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

05:31.499 --> 05:33.080
I'm trying to stay alive...

05:33.167 --> 05:35.078
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

05:35.169 --> 05:37.876
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.419
If you can hear me...
Beware.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.498
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

05:41.592 --> 05:44.299
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

05:44.386 --> 05:48.846
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless, for the nightmares
I've seen.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.265
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

05:51.352 --> 05:53.809
Not show them...
You exist...

05:53.896 --> 05:57.639
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.341
(groaning)

06:30.474 --> 06:32.214
Aeryn! Where's Aeryn?

06:32.309 --> 06:33.424
Aeryn?!

06:34.061 --> 06:34.925
Here.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.931
Under a pile of dren!

06:37.022 --> 06:38.853
Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.431
Nothin' like a bomb
to sober you up.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.562
I'm fine. Anybody hurt?
-Stark!

06:42.653 --> 06:45.360
l'm bleeding! Help me!
I'm bleeding!
-l'm here. I'm coming.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.187
Hey, what happened here?
Was it a bomb?

06:47.283 --> 06:48.648
The storm!

06:48.742 --> 06:51.404
I thought you said the storms
were no problem!

06:51.495 --> 06:53.156
Pilot, how's Moya?

06:53.247 --> 06:56.205
Pilot:
We've been thrown into
the docking rings.

06:56.292 --> 07:01.582
Moya's elastic skin saved us,
but three hatches have ruptured.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.163
Chiana, can you hear me?

07:04.258 --> 07:05.794
l, uh, got you, Pilot.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.421
There's a hatch breach
on tier seven.

07:08.512 --> 07:09.467
l'm onto it.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.795
ls Jothee all right?

07:10.889 --> 07:12.345
Oh, yeah. He's fine.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.515
I'd better get up to Moya and
see if there are any survivors.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.467
Check on her exterior.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.142
Chiana!

07:18.230 --> 07:19.686
This guy... this guy's moving!

07:19.773 --> 07:20.979
What?

07:23.235 --> 07:24.736
What'd you do to him?

07:24.820 --> 07:26.526
ldidn't do anything. The thing
busted open, he started moving.

07:26.614 --> 07:27.899
Well... well, close it up!
Just...

07:27.990 --> 07:30.402
ldon't think you can just
"close it up."

07:30.492 --> 07:32.448
What the hell's he waking up
for? I thought he was dead.

07:32.536 --> 07:36.154
No, no, no. They were
quick-frozen or something before
they died. Stay with him.

07:36.248 --> 07:39.206
I don't want to stay here.
-Just make sure he's okay,
all right?

07:39.293 --> 07:40.783
Crichton wants to talk to him.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.836
He thinks he's... he thinks,
uh, some kind of relative.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.129
Chiana! What if he heard us
when we were...

07:46.216 --> 07:49.458
Jothee! I gotta stabilize
the frelling hatch!

07:51.805 --> 07:53.306
(weak gasping )

07:54.975 --> 07:57.352
Whoa! Watch where you're going!

07:57.436 --> 07:59.051
Watch yourself, slut.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.057
What did you say?
-Out of my way.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.561
Zhaan needs these medical
supplies on the station.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.188
What's the matter
with you, Ryg?

08:06.278 --> 08:08.360
I heard you.

08:08.447 --> 08:09.653
You heard nothing.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.607
Freezer chamber.
Young half-breed.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.657
Any of this getting you wet?

08:16.288 --> 08:17.494
If you tell D'Argo,

08:17.581 --> 08:20.823
I will rip out your tongue and
shove it up your fekik!

08:20.918 --> 08:23.284
You idiot, lwon't have
to tell him.

08:23.379 --> 08:26.587
He's Luxan. He'll smell
Jothee all over you.

08:26.674 --> 08:27.584
( sniffing )

08:27.675 --> 08:29.415
(loud rumbling)

08:30.803 --> 08:32.418
Keep your lips shut.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.548
Hmm...

08:33.639 --> 08:36.221
You do the same with your legs.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.718
D'Argo:
I'm in the Transport Pod, Pilot.

08:37.810 --> 08:40.301
Three of the station's five
pods have been destroyed.

08:40.396 --> 08:42.432
I can't find any signs
of survivors.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.854
How's Moya?

08:43.941 --> 08:45.932
Well, her epidermis
seems intact

08:46.026 --> 08:48.483
but she's tangled up in some
of the station's cables.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.858
I'll see if I can
reverse us clear.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.281
Look, Pilot, wait.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.488
There's another ship close by.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.662
It seems intact. Try to bring
it in using the docking web.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.910
I'll try, D'Argo.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.913
Zhaan:
Don't move, Moordil.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.040
The beam has pierced
your mynan artery.

09:08.132 --> 09:11.670
What does it matter?
The station's destroyed.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.342
There must be hundreds dead.
Hundreds!

09:14.430 --> 09:16.170
Shhh, stay calm, Moordil.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.301
There's nothing we can do
about those souls, anyway.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.882
Everything's gone.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.888
Borlik:
Then those stories
must be true.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.685
What are you talking about?

09:23.772 --> 09:28.391
You see, there were once three
Commerce Stations near the
twin suns of Qell.

09:28.485 --> 09:34.230
But one has been destroyed
by asteroids, one has
been burned by fire,

09:34.324 --> 09:37.691
and we are the last
remaining station.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.945
There were stories that
we were cursed.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.779
Why would you be cursed?

09:42.875 --> 09:47.835
Because this station is
built on what we call
the Sacred Stillness.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.038
This is where some say the
great Gods were born.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.794
Moordil:
That's just dren!

09:52.885 --> 09:55.342
There's no curse. It was...
it was just storms.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.761
Borlik:
No, they weakened before
they reached us.

09:57.848 --> 10:02.012
But you know this last cycle,
it's been gaining in strength.

10:02.102 --> 10:06.186
The storms have been compacting
to funnels just
six parisims wide.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.811
Each storm getting closer.

10:09.902 --> 10:12.359
It's as if they were
aimed at us.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.152
You can't aim a storm.

10:14.239 --> 10:17.026
Then the curse must be true.

10:17.117 --> 10:23.909
This is Gezma's revenge for
buying and selling in his
Sacred Stillness.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.210
Where am I?

10:27.294 --> 10:29.125
On a Leviathan.

10:29.213 --> 10:32.171
We found you in a medical lab.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.339
You don't remember how
you got here?

10:34.426 --> 10:36.007
No...

10:36.094 --> 10:38.255
| just...

10:38.347 --> 10:41.305
l was on an expedition.

10:41.391 --> 10:46.101
We were looking for the Dimordis
Tomb in the Berger Nebula.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.770
I got sick.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.936
Stanis and me got sick.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.309
Jool found us.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.612
When you were in there,
before you woke up,

10:57.699 --> 10:59.781
you hear anything?

11:00.702 --> 11:04.115
I sensed... some movement.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.993
Kind ofa thumping sound.

11:07.084 --> 11:10.247
It didn't last long.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.543
( retching )

11:11.630 --> 11:13.712
Are you okay?

11:13.799 --> 11:16.506
I'm supposed to look after you
so don't do anything crazy.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.130
Oh, frell!

11:19.221 --> 11:21.212
Chiana, get down here!

11:22.349 --> 11:24.180
I think this guy's dying!

11:25.143 --> 11:26.599
Get down here.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.302
Handle it yourself!

11:28.397 --> 11:30.604
Pilot:
See if you can force it, Chiana!

11:33.026 --> 11:35.403
Pilot? I've sealed the vent.

11:38.073 --> 11:39.938
Pilot?

11:40.033 --> 11:42.115
We've got another problem.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.401
The child... uh...

11:44.496 --> 11:48.489
the child your friend saw must
be trapped in the lower pod.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.540
There is... there is...

11:50.627 --> 11:54.916
there was a nursery there for
when the parents were shopping.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.498
How do | get down there?
-You can't.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.584
All the connecting walkways
are crushed.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.885
No, no, no, no.
There's always another way in.

12:01.972 --> 12:07.342
Moordil:
If those filtration vents have
integrity, they link to waste conduits in the lower pod.

12:07.436 --> 12:08.721
Stark:
Over here?

12:08.812 --> 12:10.143
Yes, that's it.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.219
All right, I'll check them out.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.180
Crichton:
All right, I'm coming with you.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.181
Chiana:
What did you do to him?

12:15.277 --> 12:16.232
Jothee:
Nothing.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.106
He puked on me, then he died.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.187
You killed him, didn't you?
-What?!

12:20.282 --> 12:22.318
What, did he see us?
Is that why you killed him?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.320
No, he didn't see us.
ldidn't ki...

12:24.411 --> 12:26.743
Even if he did,
lwouldn't kill him!

12:26.830 --> 12:28.161
He just died.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.284
D'Argo:
Chiana.
-Yeah, D'Argo.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.206
You and Jothee get down to
the transport hangar

12:32.294 --> 12:35.786
and make sure that ship we're
bringing on board isn't hostile.

12:35.881 --> 12:38.293
We're on our way.
Go bathe.

12:38.383 --> 12:41.045
What? We're in the middle
of this massive khamsin

12:41.136 --> 12:42.251
and you want me to wash?

12:42.346 --> 12:44.587
What do you smell, Jothee?

12:44.681 --> 12:46.217
Right now?

12:46.308 --> 12:49.095
You smell me, don't you?
And you're only half Luxan.

12:49.186 --> 12:53.225
D'Argo will smell me all over
you unless you go bathe before
he gets back on board.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.477
Go. Go now.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.899
All right Moordil, short
incline and then it splits off.

13:01.990 --> 13:05.198
If it's still intact the lower
vent should lead to the nursery.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.276
Got it. After me.

13:07.371 --> 13:09.077
After you.

13:12.084 --> 13:15.042
Aeryn:
You know, I've been thinking.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.915
About us.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.542
Crichton:
You want to talk
about this now?

13:19.633 --> 13:22.124
Oh, it's a good time.

13:22.219 --> 13:25.302
No one here to bother us.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.347
I know the pressures
of living close.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.548
How it can effect the safety...

13:29.643 --> 13:31.258
(loud rumbling)
of an entire battalion...

13:31.353 --> 13:34.811
( grunts )
unless tensions are relieved.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.181
So what do you suggest?

13:38.276 --> 13:43.066
Well, in Peacekeepers it was
common practice to, uh...

13:43.699 --> 13:46.361
reduce fluid levels.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.442
Fluid levels? Like...

13:48.537 --> 13:50.528
well, like Valvoline?
Like brake fluid?

13:50.622 --> 13:52.578
Like sex.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.287
We can have sex if you want.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.118
(loud rumbling)

13:59.214 --> 14:00.954
( Crichton groans )

14:01.049 --> 14:04.917
You know what? Uh...
now is not a good time.

14:05.012 --> 14:09.301
How about I, uh, check my diary
and get back to you later
in the week?

14:09.391 --> 14:12.383
It would relieve the tension.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.310
Is this for you or for me?

14:19.401 --> 14:21.141
For both of us.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.109
You know what?

14:26.199 --> 14:29.282
I got...

14:29.369 --> 14:31.200
two hands.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.368
I can alternate. I can release
all the tension I want.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.701
I don't need your charity.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.662
And I don't need your emotions.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.169
But we can have sex
if you want.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.090
Watch that. That's broken.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.668
Yeah.

14:47.763 --> 14:50.345
But don't change the subject.

14:50.432 --> 14:53.048
What are you afraid of, John?

14:58.148 --> 14:59.354
Aeryn!

15:00.484 --> 15:03.226
Aeryn!

15:06.323 --> 15:08.314
Aeryn!

15:10.619 --> 15:13.235
Aeryn!

15:13.330 --> 15:14.410
Aeryn:
John!

15:14.498 --> 15:15.613
You okay?

15:15.707 --> 15:17.038
Yeah, I'm okay.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.241
Something smells completely
frelnik down here,

15:19.336 --> 15:22.203
so I suspect I've found the
waste conduit Moordil said
we had to find.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.413
Look, just stay where you are.
I'll go get some help and
we'll get you out.

15:24.508 --> 15:27.545
No, I'm going to follow this
down. See if it leads
to the lower pod.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.342
No, stay where you are.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.011
Tell Moordil l'll Comm him
when I need directions.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.009
Damn it, you stubborn...

15:33.100 --> 15:34.431
Pilot:
Crichton.

15:34.518 --> 15:36.975
Pilot, I'll call you back.
I can't talk right now.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.222
You have to talk.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.271
I've run the residual storm
graph you wanted.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.598
You were right.

15:42.692 --> 15:45.684
The storm took a 90-degree
turn to hit us.

15:45.779 --> 15:46.894
90 degrees?

15:46.988 --> 15:49.900
It seems to have come
after us on purpose.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.902
And there's worse.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.154
Pilot says there's another
storm on the way.

15:54.246 --> 15:58.114
It's gonna hit us in less
than two arns and it's bigger
than the last one.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.496
Hit us? This station can't
take another hit.
-Yeah, I know that.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.043
Then let's all get onto Moya
and haul out of here.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.622
I can't pull the spike out
of Moordil and I can't
just leave him here.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.968
Well, he's going to die,
isn't he?
-We|l, yes, but...

16:09.052 --> 16:11.964
What does it matter if
we leave him?
-Blue... Blue, Sparky, just knock it off.

16:12.055 --> 16:15.593
We've got at least two arns.
Aeryn can use that time to
try free the trapped girl.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.141
I don't give a sisil's arse
about a trapped girl.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.685
Yes, and that's what makes you
a great humanitarian,
Buckwheat,

16:20.772 --> 16:22.103
but we are not leaving.

16:22.190 --> 16:26.024
Scooby Doo time.
All right, here's the deal.

16:26.111 --> 16:29.820
Our pilot says that the storms
are being attracted by
a flux broadcast

16:29.906 --> 16:31.771
being generated somewhere
inside this station.

16:31.867 --> 16:33.073
The station?
-From in here?

16:33.160 --> 16:34.320
Yes.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.276
Someone's targeting the
storm at us?

16:36.371 --> 16:36.996
Yes.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.195
You see?

16:38.290 --> 16:40.497
I told you the storms weren't
Gezma's wrath.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.916
No. You just managed to
piss somebody off.

16:43.003 --> 16:46.791
Now, do you have any idea
who would wanna destroy
your station?

16:48.341 --> 16:49.797
Tell him.

16:50.719 --> 16:51.674
Frell.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.298
Go on, tell him.

16:54.389 --> 16:58.428
I'm probably going to
die anyway.

16:59.728 --> 17:03.141
There's a cult of religious
zealots, the Kampeks.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.096
Some call them noble warriors.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.352
Moordil:
But they're not.
They're insane.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.149
And you can't bribe them.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.693
I tried when I thought they
were responsible

17:10.780 --> 17:12.486
for the destruction of
the other stations.

17:12.574 --> 17:16.112
Stark:
Kampeks? This is their
Sacred Stillness?

17:16.203 --> 17:21.072
You see, they say we're
desecrating their gods by
buying and selling here.

17:21.166 --> 17:23.327
They must be broadcasting
the storm signals.

17:23.418 --> 17:25.249
Rygel:
Then let's destroy it.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.420
Let's find out where the
signals are coming
from and smash it.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.168
How? There are 12 levels
on this station.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.999
You'll never search it
in two arns.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.755
Crichton:
We might.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.757
I've got an idea.

17:40.894 --> 17:44.853
D'Argo:
Pilot says it's empty but he
can't sense how to get inside.

17:48.485 --> 17:51.352
The defense shield is active
all the way around the ship.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.811
Jothee:
Give me a shot.
I'll get inside.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.066
(inhaling)

17:54.157 --> 17:55.863
What's that smell?

17:55.951 --> 17:56.906
( sniffing )

17:56.993 --> 17:59.200
l bathed.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.151
Idid.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.203
Twice.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.997
Are you wearing perfumed wash?

18:05.085 --> 18:08.327
Yeah, I gave him some
from Zhaan's chamber.

18:08.421 --> 18:12.380
Yeah, well, uh...
you smell very nice.
-Give me a break.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.082
No, no, really, you do.
You smell just...

18:14.177 --> 18:15.963
Shut up. You can find you own
way into the frelling ship.

18:16.054 --> 18:19.296
Jothee! l was only teasing.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.347
Jothee!

18:28.608 --> 18:32.772
Um, you look attractive.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.982
Do I?

18:35.073 --> 18:37.439
Yes, like you're happy.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.408
I'm not.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.617
I know I've been a trasnik
and I want to apologize.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.494
Look, don't worry
about it, okay?

18:46.584 --> 18:50.873
No, really. I am so sorry.

18:50.964 --> 18:54.331
And there's, uh, something I'd
like to talk to you about if...

18:54.426 --> 18:57.213
Uh, look, D'Argo, I'm not, I'm
not ready to talk now, okay?

18:57.304 --> 18:59.260
What do you want me to do, beg?
I said I'm sorry.

18:59.347 --> 19:03.090
No, I don't want you to beg. |
just... I'm not ready to talk.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.426
Just because you're ready to
talk, it doesn't mean that I am.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.981
Okay.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.556
I'm sorry, I...

19:14.779 --> 19:17.236
Uh, Pilot's...

19:17.324 --> 19:22.284
Pilot's got two more hatches
for me to check and | just
wanted to do that first, okay?

19:22.370 --> 19:24.326
Fine.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.247
Fine.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.372
Okay.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.630
( sniffing )

19:36.718 --> 19:39.960
Stark:
That's just about the
last of the DRDs.

19:40.055 --> 19:42.341
lf Crichton's correct, they
should give us some indication

19:42.432 --> 19:44.343
of where the signal's
coming from.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.049
What's the matter?

19:46.144 --> 19:49.261
Oh, nothing. Have you got
One-Eye working yet?

19:49.356 --> 19:53.725
Not yet. I think it's the energy
exchanger, but that can wait.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.228
Don't worry about me, Stark.
It's all right.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.276
Let me look at your head.
-No, just stop...

19:57.364 --> 19:58.729
I said let me look at it!

19:58.823 --> 20:00.814
Let me look at it now!

20:24.766 --> 20:27.348
The sores are worse.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.972
The weakening is progressing.
-Stark, don't.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.679
Much faster. Much faster than
we predicted, much.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.231
But, I... lwill find
you a planet.

20:35.318 --> 20:38.230
A planet with the right
soil and moisture.

20:38.321 --> 20:41.313
Calm yourself, Stark. Please.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.443
You're the expert here.

20:42.534 --> 20:45.367
You've witnessed more death
than anyone else.

20:45.453 --> 20:48.945
So many dissatisfied souls
dying before they felt ready.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.656
Yes, I'm an expert on dying.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.335
I'm just not an expert
on you dying.

21:00.343 --> 21:01.879
All right, Moordil.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.302
Looks like some kind of binary
code followed by four circles.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.380
Moordil:
Ah, you've reached
the lower pod.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.011
Keep going for another
300 metras.

21:09.102 --> 21:09.966
Got it.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.801
(knocking)
Help!

21:11.896 --> 21:14.353
Hello?
-Is anyone there?

21:14.816 --> 21:15.896
Hello?

21:15.984 --> 21:18.396
(distant pounding on
bulkhead )

21:21.990 --> 21:23.321
Do you think he knows?

21:23.408 --> 21:24.614
How could he know?

21:24.701 --> 21:27.989
He looked at me like he knew.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.489
What are you gonna tell him?

21:29.581 --> 21:30.991
I'm not gonna tell
him anything.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.697
D'Argo:
Tell who?

21:35.128 --> 21:40.248
Crichton. We don't know what to
tell him about the guy cacking.

21:40.341 --> 21:43.333
I'm sure he'll understand
it wasn't your fault.

21:43.428 --> 21:45.510
I thought Pilot wanted you
to reseal the hatch.

21:45.597 --> 21:47.258
l was on my way down
to help you.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.259
Well, he did.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.841
He does. We're, we're going now.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.515
What's that smell?

21:58.610 --> 22:01.147
I told you. It's just
the scented wash.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.023
You know, the perfume wash.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.105
No, no, no, no, no.
There's something else.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.906
( sniffing )

22:07.869 --> 22:10.076
Well I don't smell anything.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.615
Why are you both in here?

22:15.710 --> 22:18.668
I told you. We were just
checking on the dead guy.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.417
I don't believe you.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.051
Did you talk to Rygel?

22:27.555 --> 22:29.091
About what?

22:36.481 --> 22:37.470
You have betrayed me.

22:37.565 --> 22:38.975
D'Argo...
-With my own manin.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.682
I'm not your manin.
-Obviously.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.563
ldidn't mean that. l...
-Well what did you mean?

22:42.654 --> 22:45.111
D'Argo, let's not...
-Let's not what?

22:46.241 --> 22:47.731
Get angry?

22:49.327 --> 22:51.192
Or...

22:51.287 --> 22:52.993
kill you?

22:59.379 --> 23:00.789
Do you know what this is?

23:00.880 --> 23:03.121
D'Argo, this is my fault.
Mine, not Jothee's.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.207
Get away from me now.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.136
It's a union tattoo.

23:11.099 --> 23:15.217
It's a Luxan symbol of
courage, honor,

23:15.311 --> 23:18.348
and loyalty.

23:18.439 --> 23:21.476
l was going to give it to
Chiana, but I was wrong.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.725
I want you to have it.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.902
D'Argo, I don't want
to have to...
-No, I insist!

23:25.989 --> 23:28.401
D'Argo, let him go!
-Get away from me!

23:28.491 --> 23:29.856
( screaming )

23:30.702 --> 23:31.862
D'Argo!

23:35.123 --> 23:36.238
(grunting)

23:36.332 --> 23:39.039
(groaning)

23:40.253 --> 23:42.084
But you...

23:42.171 --> 23:43.707
you will never get these.

23:43.798 --> 23:45.663
D'Argo, listen to me.
-No!

23:48.469 --> 23:52.337
I will never listen to anything
either of you have to say again.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.388
D'Argo.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.932
D'Argo. D'Argo!

24:06.446 --> 24:10.815
I know what it was
I smelled before.

24:10.908 --> 24:14.196
It was a burnt-out function
cell in the cryo chamber.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.662
(whirring )
There. Got it.

24:26.841 --> 24:27.921
What is it?

24:28.009 --> 24:29.294
I don't know.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.130
Crichton:
What you got?

24:32.221 --> 24:33.597
The signal's coming from here.

24:33.681 --> 24:34.921
Moordil:
From here?

24:35.016 --> 24:36.347
Crichton, Borlik, back off.

24:36.434 --> 24:39.301
But I'm... I'm not sending out
any frelling signal.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.680
( beeping slows)

24:40.772 --> 24:42.012
See, I told you.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.687
( beeping speeds up)

24:43.775 --> 24:45.982
What?

24:46.069 --> 24:48.276
Well why is it making
this noise?

24:49.572 --> 24:52.314
Why is it making that noise?

24:52.408 --> 24:53.818
(growling and hissing)

24:55.203 --> 24:57.489
Obviously, you haven't
fixed it properly.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.081
You sure One-Eye's
working right?

24:59.165 --> 25:00.120
It's working.

25:00.208 --> 25:02.039
No, it's broken.

25:03.461 --> 25:05.918
Give him the Scooby Doo
snack, then.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.001
Where's the signal coming from?

25:11.010 --> 25:13.547
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

25:13.638 --> 25:15.970
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

25:16.057 --> 25:18.218
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

25:18.309 --> 25:20.015
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

25:20.103 --> 25:21.843
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

25:21.938 --> 25:23.599
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

25:23.690 --> 25:25.180
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

25:25.274 --> 25:26.309
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

25:26.401 --> 25:27.641
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

25:27.735 --> 25:29.271
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

25:29.362 --> 25:31.398
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.

25:31.489 --> 25:34.026
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.

25:34.117 --> 25:36.779
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.246
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.615
Lak-ma-ru ka-be.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.073
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.

25:46.254 --> 25:51.248
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.

25:51.342 --> 25:52.923
Dude, she's stuck, man.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.170
She's still broadcasting.

25:54.262 --> 25:56.924
Yeah, but where's the signal
coming from?

25:57.014 --> 25:58.845
I think it's coming from
inside her.

25:58.933 --> 26:00.173
Lak-ma-ruka-be...
-|nside her?!

26:00.268 --> 26:02.133
Is that why she's stuck
to the wall?

26:02.228 --> 26:04.844
I don't know. She's somehow
magnetized herself to the pipe.

26:04.939 --> 26:07.180
Okay. Enough.

26:07.275 --> 26:10.813
Let's kill her cut her off
the frelling pipe and
chuck her out.

26:10.903 --> 26:14.896
Moordil:
No, no, no, no. That pipe
is hydro-honium steel.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.607
Frozen exhaust.

26:17.702 --> 26:21.320
If you rupture it, we'll
freeze in 10 microts.

26:21.414 --> 26:26.033
Borlik:
Worm, are you ready to die in
the cleansing apocalypse?

26:26.127 --> 26:28.118
Lak-ma-ruka-be...
-Worm?!

26:28.212 --> 26:30.624
Are you ready to die in
a cleansing ramming?

26:30.715 --> 26:31.625
( growls )

26:31.716 --> 26:33.001
Rygel, cut it out.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.504
I'm going to kill the
bitch now!

26:35.595 --> 26:38.462
Rygel, we don't know
what's going on.

26:38.556 --> 26:42.595
We don't know anything so we
don't know if killing her will
stop the damn signal.

26:42.685 --> 26:46.473
Who cares? lt'll shut her up
and make me feel good.

26:46.564 --> 26:48.475
( chanting ):
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.522
Crichton:
Buckwheat!

26:50.610 --> 26:51.349
Stop it.

26:51.444 --> 26:52.934
Go on, kill me.

26:53.029 --> 26:56.817
Shoot me. Cut me into pieces and
burn my flesh with selik acid

26:56.908 --> 26:59.194
but my broadcast will
still be sent.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.446
The apocalypse will
cleanse you all.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.869
Rygel:
At least let me shut her up.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.207
Borlik:
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

27:05.291 --> 27:07.657
(muted chanting )
Shove it in deep, Rygel.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.208
Pilot, how long before that
storm hits?

27:09.295 --> 27:12.332
Pilot:
It seems to be increasing
in velocity.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.288
Probably less than an arn.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.884
But I was thinking.

27:15.968 --> 27:21.304
Since the pipe Borlik's
magnetized to is made of
hydro-honium steel,

27:21.390 --> 27:25.053
perhaps if we found a
larger source of it...

27:25.144 --> 27:27.931
It would pull her away
from the pipe.

27:28.022 --> 27:30.104
Good. We have any of that
hydro-crap on board?

27:30.191 --> 27:33.228
Running an inventory check now.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.526
Aeryn, you might have to
forget about the kid.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.194
I think I heard something.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.192
Crichton:
Make it quick. You've got
less than an arn.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.023
Girl:
Are you still there?

27:41.118 --> 27:43.370
Yes, I'm here. ljust need
to know where you are.
Keep making noise.

27:43.454 --> 27:44.830
Girl:
Help! Hurry!

27:44.914 --> 27:46.245
Yeah, hang on, I'm coming.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.618
I'll follow your voice.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.040
Girl:
Please!

27:50.127 --> 27:53.585
l've located three sources
of hydro-steel.

27:53.673 --> 27:56.130
Two are in the neural cluster
cooling rods.

27:56.217 --> 27:58.253
Can we get to it?
-Not in time.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.960
But the third source
is accessible.

28:01.055 --> 28:05.344
The cryo-chambers you brought
aboard are lined with
hydro-steel.

28:05.434 --> 28:08.767
The attraction from one of them
could pull Borlik loose.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.766
Crichton:
Good. So we drag her
onboard Moya,

28:10.857 --> 28:13.189
fly as far away from the station
as we can, divert the storm.

28:13.276 --> 28:16.063
But we're still trapped by
the docking cables.

28:16.153 --> 28:18.530
I've tried to pull us clear,
but I can't.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.230
All right, well, find D'Argo.
Tell him I need his
help on this.

28:21.325 --> 28:24.909
I've been signaling his Comms,
but he's not answering.

28:24.996 --> 28:26.406
Why not?

28:26.497 --> 28:29.660
I think I might know why.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.211
Hey, D.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.173
How you doing?

28:45.266 --> 28:47.552
You know, don't you?

28:47.643 --> 28:49.258
Yeah.

28:50.313 --> 28:53.396
Did you know when I showed
you the union tattoos?

28:53.482 --> 28:55.313
No, I didn't.

28:56.652 --> 28:58.358
They're bragging about it,
aren't they?

28:58.446 --> 29:00.858
D'Argo, it's not like that.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.654
Rygel found out, and he
told me what...

29:02.742 --> 29:04.858
( snarling )

29:07.246 --> 29:08.622
We don't have time for this.

29:08.706 --> 29:11.573
Yes, I know. I heard you
talking to Pilot.

29:11.667 --> 29:14.249
You want me to go outside
and help free Moya.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.497
While I go grab Borlik.

29:15.588 --> 29:17.124
Well, why don't you get Chiana
and Jothee to do it.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.249
They like working together.

29:18.341 --> 29:21.925
D'Argo, they can't
free the cable.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.252
They're not as strong
as you are.

29:24.347 --> 29:26.303
They're not as brave,
they're not as smart.

29:26.390 --> 29:29.257
Oh, look, don't!
All right, just don't!

29:35.441 --> 29:37.523
They broke my heart, John.

29:38.569 --> 29:41.311
I know that.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.238
But if you don't go out on Moya
and pull that cable off,

29:44.325 --> 29:47.158
we're all going to die
when that storm hits.

29:47.244 --> 29:49.656
Then we all die.

29:51.749 --> 29:53.535
I can't hear you anymore.

29:53.626 --> 29:54.786
(steam hissing)

29:54.877 --> 29:57.209
Hello? Are you still there?

29:57.964 --> 29:59.795
Can you hear me?

29:59.882 --> 30:01.042
Hello?

30:01.133 --> 30:02.293
Frell.

30:02.385 --> 30:03.875
Hello?

30:05.388 --> 30:06.969
What the hell were you thinking?

30:07.056 --> 30:09.138
Obviously, we weren't thinking.
-Obviously.

30:09.225 --> 30:12.683
We didn't think we'd get caught.
-Do you know what you did?

30:12.770 --> 30:17.184
You betrayed the one person on
this ship who would have done
anything for you.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.434
Both of you.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.143
He would have died for you.

30:22.238 --> 30:24.320
Yeah, we need you, D'Argo.

30:24.407 --> 30:26.193
We need you.

30:26.283 --> 30:28.695
Oh, and by the way, would you
mind putting your hands
against the wall

30:28.786 --> 30:32.370
and spreading your legs so I
can kick you up the mivonks?

30:32.456 --> 30:38.247
'Cause you have got to be
one dumb trasnik.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.713
(glass breaking )

30:43.884 --> 30:48.093
I'm starting depressurization.

30:48.180 --> 30:53.846
Pilot:
I've created an inertial field
on Moya's skin so you can move around some.

30:53.936 --> 30:55.221
But be careful.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.928
The winds are reaching
speeds of 300 nilits.

30:58.024 --> 31:01.733
I've got a breathing regulator
in case l have to stay
out there.

31:01.819 --> 31:05.027
Crichton told me you
weren't going out.

31:05.114 --> 31:07.355
Well, you know what?

31:07.450 --> 31:09.406
I changed my mind.

31:10.286 --> 31:11.275
Why?

31:13.831 --> 31:15.446
Good-bye, Pilot.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.786
D'Argo?

31:20.838 --> 31:22.203
D'Argo?

31:34.477 --> 31:37.139
I'm outside, Pilot.
Where are the cables?

31:37.229 --> 31:39.686
Just looking now, D'Argo.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.935
Hamman side.

31:42.026 --> 31:43.232
Got it.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.417
Take the gag out.

32:04.048 --> 32:05.879
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.

32:05.966 --> 32:07.706
You want to hear this?

32:07.802 --> 32:10.418
Borlik:
See, | see your fear, worm.

32:10.513 --> 32:14.722
But the Holy Gezma will embrace
even you, if you repent.

32:14.809 --> 32:16.140
(chuckling):
Repent?

32:16.227 --> 32:17.967
We have less than an arn.

32:18.062 --> 32:21.225
l was a Dominar. lt'd take me
longer than that to repent.

32:21.315 --> 32:24.057
When about to die you should
feel more shame.

32:24.151 --> 32:25.482
(chuckling)

32:25.569 --> 32:28.527
Hey, fridge magnet. I got
something for you to feel.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.195
What is that?

32:30.282 --> 32:31.613
Oh, what's the matter?

32:31.700 --> 32:33.611
Is that your fear I see?

32:33.702 --> 32:35.238
You're not so psycho happy now.

32:35.329 --> 32:36.660
Oh, what are you doing?

32:36.747 --> 32:39.329
This is hydro-steel.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.747
Just like that pipe.

32:40.835 --> 32:42.700
Stark:
Only this is bigger.

32:42.795 --> 32:46.162
So it may be your turn to
repent for all the souls
you've murdered.

32:46.257 --> 32:48.293
Don't! Keep it away!

32:48.384 --> 32:50.249
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.

32:50.344 --> 32:53.131
Lak-ma-ruka-be. Lak-ma-ruka-be.
Lak-ma-ruka-be...

32:53.222 --> 32:55.008
( screaming )

32:55.099 --> 32:56.464
Gezma will destroy you.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.049
Got her, Pilot.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.260
We're coming back to Moya.
We'll try to free her up.

33:00.354 --> 33:01.969
Pilot:
Crichton, don't you know?

33:02.064 --> 33:04.396
D'Argo's already outside.

33:18.706 --> 33:21.698
Pilot, I've cleared Moya of all
the cables except for two.

33:21.792 --> 33:22.998
Be careful.

33:23.085 --> 33:26.248
Those last cables are
pulse rechargers.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.714
Can you shut them down?

33:27.798 --> 33:29.880
l have no control over them.

33:29.967 --> 33:32.674
They are linked to the
station's power source.

33:32.761 --> 33:35.138
But I can't move them unless
they're neutralized.

33:35.222 --> 33:36.883
Crichton's on his way.

33:36.974 --> 33:38.339
He can help you.

33:38.434 --> 33:39.344
No.

33:39.435 --> 33:40.891
I can do this alone.

33:40.978 --> 33:43.970
Chiana:
D'Argo? Listen to me.
Wait for Crichton. He'll...

33:44.064 --> 33:45.190
D'Argo:
No, Chiana.

33:45.274 --> 33:47.640
You can nevertell me
what to do,

33:47.735 --> 33:49.976
ever again.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.152
Crichton, talk to D'Argo.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.695
Talk to him now.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.158
D'Argo?

33:55.242 --> 33:57.233
D'Argo, what are you doing
out there?

33:57.328 --> 33:59.034
What you asked me to.

33:59.121 --> 34:02.363
When I neutralize these cables
you'll be able to pull
Moya clear.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.449
Crichton:
Wait! Wait for me.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.793
Good-bye, John.

34:09.548 --> 34:12.210
No! Don't do it!

34:12.301 --> 34:13.131
( screaming )

34:13.219 --> 34:14.880
No!

34:28.275 --> 34:30.186
Pilot, why the hell did you
let him go out?

34:30.277 --> 34:32.438
He didn't ask for my permission.

34:32.529 --> 34:33.905
You could've stopped him!

34:33.989 --> 34:36.947
I would shut up and stop
wasting time, Commander!

34:37.034 --> 34:39.116
You're telling the wrong person
to shut up.

34:39.203 --> 34:44.288
We have less than a quarter of
an arn before the storm funnel
reaches us.

34:45.209 --> 34:46.824
Any signal yet, Pilot?

34:46.919 --> 34:48.034
Nothing.

34:48.128 --> 34:51.086
Crichton, if you're unable
to save D'Argo,

34:51.173 --> 34:54.381
Moya is willing to try and rip
free from the cables, but...

34:54.468 --> 34:56.254
No, no, no! I'll get us clear.

34:56.345 --> 34:59.382
Is he dead? Is my father dead?
-I don't know.

34:59.473 --> 35:02.180
I'll go with you. I'm
half-Luxan. I can survive
out there. I'll help...

35:02.268 --> 35:05.556
You don't know that, Jothee,
and I can't be rescuing
two people.

35:05.646 --> 35:07.557
Now get out of here.

35:07.648 --> 35:11.186
Get out of here!
You're slowing me down!

35:11.277 --> 35:12.232
Crichton, no!

35:16.949 --> 35:18.280
Crichton...

35:19.285 --> 35:20.650
Do you see him?

35:20.744 --> 35:22.245
Crichton:
Not yet, Pilot.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.365
( heavy winds blowing )

35:27.918 --> 35:29.249
D'Argo!

35:30.713 --> 35:32.249
Pilot, he's not responding.

35:32.339 --> 35:35.581
I'm going to fix the ship
first, then go after him.

35:35.676 --> 35:38.292
Get to him! Get to him now!

35:40.264 --> 35:42.255
Heading for the cable.

35:48.856 --> 35:50.187
I'm coming out there myself!

35:50.274 --> 35:52.560
No, Chiana, stay the hell
where you are!

35:52.651 --> 35:54.266
Frell!

36:02.244 --> 36:03.359
Girl:
Help me!

36:03.454 --> 36:04.990
Hang on, I'm almost there!

36:05.080 --> 36:06.195
Help me!

36:06.290 --> 36:07.700
Please!

36:07.791 --> 36:09.247
Hurry!

36:09.335 --> 36:11.576
Moordil:
Save them.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.833
I should have known Borlik
was one of them.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.299
(groaning)

36:17.509 --> 36:19.886
A Kampek.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.257
Pilot, I can't...

36:27.853 --> 36:29.138
Aeryn:
Crichton!

36:29.229 --> 36:30.685
I'm at the access hatch!

36:30.773 --> 36:33.731
Moordil, what's the code?

36:35.444 --> 36:36.650
Moordil!

36:36.737 --> 36:37.692
( buzzing )

36:37.780 --> 36:39.190
What's the frelling code?

36:39.281 --> 36:41.272
Oh, Gezmana...

36:41.367 --> 36:43.449
I can't hear you!

36:44.286 --> 36:46.026
Moordil!

36:46.455 --> 36:47.570
By the Goddess.

36:47.664 --> 36:48.824
( buzzing )

36:48.916 --> 36:51.328
What's the frelling code?

36:55.756 --> 36:58.168
Aeryn, he's dead.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.384
Moordil's dead.

36:59.468 --> 37:01.709
Get back now. We've got
to get out now!

37:01.804 --> 37:03.590
No way. Not yet.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.965
| just hope this works.

37:16.652 --> 37:18.483
Frell me dead.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.738
Have you reached him?

37:30.833 --> 37:33.370
Crichton:
Not yet. I'll get to him soon.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.121
Get to him now.

37:35.212 --> 37:37.954
Chiana, I'm busy. If I don't...

37:38.048 --> 37:39.584
(yells)

37:42.594 --> 37:45.336
John, I've got you.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.512
D'Argo!

37:48.475 --> 37:50.466
Let's get the cable.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.637
You all right?

37:56.733 --> 37:58.519
All right, on my count.

38:00.446 --> 38:01.777
One...

38:03.198 --> 38:04.404
two...

38:04.491 --> 38:06.106
three!

38:09.246 --> 38:10.326
That's it, Pilot.

38:10.414 --> 38:12.746
Moya's free. We're coming in.

38:14.334 --> 38:18.122
We must draw the storm away
from the station now!

38:26.346 --> 38:28.428
Crichton:
D'Argo...

38:35.189 --> 38:37.396
Aw, man, what are you doing?

38:42.362 --> 38:44.068
Hell.

38:49.119 --> 38:51.781
I'm not going in without
you, D'Argo.

38:58.420 --> 39:02.038
Keep moving!
That way.

39:02.132 --> 39:04.714
Zhaan, what's going on? We're
getting the dren knocked
out of us down here!

39:04.801 --> 39:07.292
Aeryn, hurry! You must get
back here.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.924
Moya's freed but the storm
may still hit us.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.222
Well, if it does I don't think
we're going to make it.

39:12.893 --> 39:14.224
Hurry!

39:15.312 --> 39:16.552
Come on!

39:16.647 --> 39:18.012
Move it!

39:19.191 --> 39:20.351
Is he alive?

39:20.442 --> 39:23.149
Crichton:
He's alive. Look after him.

39:23.237 --> 39:24.898
D'Argo...

39:26.740 --> 39:28.196
Crichton, where is he?

39:28.283 --> 39:30.148
He's with Chiana.

39:30.244 --> 39:31.359
Pilot, are we moving?

39:31.453 --> 39:33.239
Attempting Starburst.

39:33.330 --> 39:37.118
No! In Starburst, the storm
won't be able to track
Borlik's signal.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.916
Accelerating now.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.337
I thought you were going
to die out there.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.881
( hoarse whisper):
Hey, come here.

39:49.221 --> 39:53.260
I want... you both...

39:53.350 --> 39:56.387
to stay away from me!

39:56.478 --> 39:58.594
(gasping)

40:01.400 --> 40:03.686
Donﬂ

40:03.777 --> 40:05.938
Crichton:
Commuter forecast on
your travel day.

40:06.029 --> 40:08.315
Storms expected,
just for you...

40:08.407 --> 40:12.696
Borlik:
I think I'll be able to
share my purification.

40:14.288 --> 40:15.869
It took all my strength,

40:15.956 --> 40:20.199
but I was able to reconfigure
the magnetics and stick here.

40:20.294 --> 40:25.288
By the time you cut me down
the storm will be upon us.

40:25.382 --> 40:27.338
Lak-ma-ru ka-be.

40:27.426 --> 40:28.415
Lak-ma-ru ka-be.

40:28.510 --> 40:30.375
You're too smart.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.094
Where are you going?

40:33.181 --> 40:35.342
Uh, you win, we lose.

40:35.434 --> 40:37.220
You... you outsmarted us.

40:37.311 --> 40:39.176
(chuckling)

40:39.271 --> 40:41.307
But that door you're stuck to...

40:41.398 --> 40:43.389
It's detachable.

40:43.483 --> 40:44.313
No!

40:44.401 --> 40:47.063
Yes.
-No, you lie!

40:47.154 --> 40:49.315
No, you will still be purified.

40:49.406 --> 40:52.694
The Holy Gezma's punishment
will be brought down upon...

40:52.784 --> 40:54.115
Blah-blah, blah-blah, blah.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.817
Pilot!
-Lak-ma-ruka-be!

40:55.912 --> 40:57.413
I'm clear. Detach the door.

40:57.497 --> 40:58.452
(rumbling and hissing)

40:58.540 --> 41:00.622
and suck this bitch out!

41:00.709 --> 41:02.745
Lak-ma-ru ka-be!

41:02.836 --> 41:04.201
Lak-ma-ru ka-be!

41:04.296 --> 41:06.912
(laughing)

41:10.469 --> 41:12.209
( screaming )

41:21.730 --> 41:23.516
There you go.

41:25.359 --> 41:27.190
That's it.

41:27.277 --> 41:30.314
Watch your head.
Good.

41:30.405 --> 41:32.111
Thank the Goddess,
the children are safe.

41:32.199 --> 41:35.407
Now we must find a planet where
you can regain your strength.

41:35.494 --> 41:37.735
If She so wishes it.

41:49.257 --> 41:53.626
Been thinking about that
thing we talked about.

41:53.720 --> 41:58.714
About charity, and, uh,
maybe...

41:58.809 --> 42:00.925
Maybe you were right.

42:01.937 --> 42:04.178
We should do nothing.

42:05.607 --> 42:08.189
What about body fluids?

42:10.570 --> 42:13.186
There'll be a backlog.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.281
Fluid levels? Backlog?

42:16.368 --> 42:19.701
Is there some kind of problem?

42:19.788 --> 42:21.198
Shut up.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.154
Hmm? What did I say?

42:23.250 --> 42:25.115
Shut up.
-Shut up.

42:32.509 --> 42:34.090
You're really gonna...

42:34.177 --> 42:36.384
you're gonna leave
without saying anything?

42:36.471 --> 42:38.132
Yeah.

42:39.141 --> 42:41.348
D'Argo's right.

42:41.435 --> 42:44.677
I know nothing of Luxan
honor or integrity.

42:45.355 --> 42:48.142
I'm a half-Luxan.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.189
l betrayed him.

42:50.277 --> 42:53.815
And if I stay, l'll...
I'll probably do it again.

42:55.699 --> 42:58.441
Chiana:
It wasn't all your fault.

42:59.411 --> 43:02.073
Yeah, I never figured that bit.

43:02.164 --> 43:03.700
Why'd you do it?

43:03.790 --> 43:05.576
I don't know.

43:07.627 --> 43:11.495
D'Argo had plans for... for me.

43:12.257 --> 43:15.545
For a stupid farm.

43:15.635 --> 43:17.921
ldidn't want any of them.

43:21.266 --> 43:24.383
I knew he wouldn't take no
for an answer, so ljust...

43:25.854 --> 43:29.392
I figured I had to do something
he'd never forgive.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.734
You used me?

43:37.032 --> 43:39.193
Yeah, a little.

43:41.787 --> 43:46.156
But you enjoyed it, didn't you?

43:52.297 --> 44:00.045
Tell my father, if he'll let
you, that I'm sorry.

44:00.138 --> 44:06.384
And that one day I'll return
and make it up to you both.

44:08.146 --> 44:10.011
Chiana:
I'll tell him.
