WEBVTT

00:05.273 --> 00:06.474
You're smiling.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.443
- Why?
- Well...

00:10.578 --> 00:12.946
That is your menstrual cycle.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.416
It's been a year
since we lost the baby,

00:15.549 --> 00:18.186
and I finished
my anti-coagulants.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.287
Which means...

00:19.420 --> 00:21.555
We can try to conceive again.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.192
Mm-hmm. I have an appointment
with Dr. Winkler today.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.760
- If she gives us the go-ahead--
- A year was the minimum.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.029
Good vibes, Shaun.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.599
Send good vibes
into the universe,

00:31.732 --> 00:32.966
good things come back.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.169
Vibe with me, babe.

00:35.303 --> 00:38.906
I would very much like
to have a baby with Lea!

00:39.039 --> 00:40.541
Okay.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.410
Well, get ready to make one.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.978
Okay. We are
going to make a baby.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.481
Yeah. Mm.

00:49.483 --> 00:52.019
- Mm.
- Oh.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.955
I have 23 minutes
until I need to leave for work.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.530
Should we save your swimmy guys
until I ovulate?

01:02.663 --> 01:04.632
Oh, recent research demonstrated

01:04.765 --> 01:06.834
frequent ejaculation
improves sperm motility.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.936
Oh! [laughs] In that case...

01:10.704 --> 01:11.839
Oh, yeah.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.614
We can talk about it.
Okay? Thanks so much.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.355
Isabel.

01:30.724 --> 01:31.525
What are you doing here?

01:32.793 --> 01:36.364
Gena Cooper.
Pregnant with sextuplets.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.432
That's what all my calls
and texts were about.

01:38.566 --> 01:41.569
So you would already know
if you'd answered.

01:54.915 --> 01:58.419
You show up,
ask me for a consult,
like you're any other doctor?

01:58.552 --> 02:02.623
Whatever the appropriate
approach is for ex-wives,
tell me, and I'll take it.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.227
Couple couldn't conceive,
so I prescribed clomiphene.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.731
Six babies
just after one round.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.933
- They won the lottery.
- Or lost.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.568
Two require immediate
surgical intervention.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.037
At least. Know any surgeons?

02:22.042 --> 02:24.945
Marcus, this family
needs your help.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.447
If needed,
I will step off the case

02:26.580 --> 02:28.349
and I will find them
another OB.

02:33.787 --> 02:34.588
Stay.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.093
It wouldn't be fair
to the patient.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.967
Each of your babies
gets their own dedicated
team of doctors.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.703
Now, since all of the babies
will be under two pounds
at birth,

02:49.837 --> 02:52.139
they will all need
a lot of care, attention,

02:52.273 --> 02:55.476
and time in our NICU,
maturing those lungs.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.078
Once they're feeling
strong enough
to make some demands,

02:59.913 --> 03:01.048
you'll hear that beautiful cry.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.017
A baby crying is a good thing.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.686
It lets us know
the baby's healthy.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.655
And that's when we name them,

03:07.788 --> 03:09.323
once they've cried
and we know they're okay.

03:09.457 --> 03:12.626
I wish they could stay inside
Mom longer and get bigger.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.497
Baby F's airway mass
is already causing

03:16.630 --> 03:18.799
severe narrowing
of the trachea,

03:18.932 --> 03:20.368
and her lungs
aren't developing properly.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.703
A few more days,
and her heart could fail.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.038
- So we deliver today.
- Yes.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.040
Everyone ready?

03:32.880 --> 03:36.584
<i>Baby A through Baby E
will all be born
in under three minutes.</i>

03:36.717 --> 03:39.219
Baby A.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.954
<i>At birth,
they'll each be given
an Apgar score</i>

03:41.088 --> 03:43.457
<i>to let us know
how they are doing.</i>

03:43.591 --> 03:45.993
<i>Seven or above is reassuring.</i>

03:46.126 --> 03:47.328
It's a girl.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.864
Baby B.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.366
All right. Hello.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.870
Baby A, Apgar 7.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.842
It's a boy.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.778
Surprise. Mono-di.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.515
B and C share
the same placenta.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.682
Very rare. Identical twins.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.085
Another boy, obviously.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.587
Baby B, Apgar 5.

04:16.724 --> 04:17.891
Baby C, Apgar 4.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.161
Baby D.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.373
It's... a boy.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.412
Baby E.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.713
Baby D, Apgar 6.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.289
Spina bifida.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.794
Baby E's a girl.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.768
Baby E, Apgar 6.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.302
<i>Baby E
will go to the OR</i>

05:02.436 --> 05:04.705
<i>for her spina bifida surgery
after delivery.</i>

05:04.838 --> 05:07.575
Exposing Baby F
to EXIT procedure.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.578
Once
Baby A through Baby E
are in the NICU,

05:10.711 --> 05:14.247
Dr. Barnes will deliver
Baby F's arm and head

05:14.382 --> 05:17.284
<i>through the C-section incision,
leaving the placenta attached.</i>

05:17.418 --> 05:20.153
<i>And, Mom, that allows you
to keep providing oxygen
to your daughter.</i>

05:20.287 --> 05:23.657
Nurse Denning, take Papa
to check on his other babies.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.360
We're all good here, Jack.
Dr. Lim?

05:26.494 --> 05:30.130
<i>Then, Dr. Lim will perform
the EXIT procedure.</i>

05:30.263 --> 05:31.999
First time it's ever been done
in a multiple birth.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.771
She's got this.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.142
Moving through
the oropharynx cavity.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.478
Baby F's
umbilical cord looks
very thin and friable.

05:44.612 --> 05:45.879
Placenta's still attached?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.915
Yep. Mama's giving her
all the oxygen she needs.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.050
At the larynx.
Approaching the trachea.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.120
I've identified the cyst.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.488
The pulse
is extremely faint.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.857
The cyst is causing total
obliteration of the airway.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.358
Microblator.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.893
I've completely lost
the pulse in the cord.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.395
We have
less than a minute to deliver.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.996
Having trouble
visualizing the base.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.398
Maybe
you're not there yet?

06:04.532 --> 06:05.833
- Probing deeper.
- Keep going. Little more.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.069
I see it.
You're two millimeters away.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.805
Got it.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.809
Cyst is decompressed.
Airway's open.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.111
Placing ET tube.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.584
Finally... Baby F.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.619
- It's a girl.
- Okay.

06:35.128 --> 06:35.863
Good work.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.266
Baby F, Apgar 5.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.005
Thank you for taking this on.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.340
The hard part's just beginning.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.582
Okay.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.755
Baby A's
one and five-minute Apgar?

07:34.888 --> 07:36.223
Seven and nine.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.826
Mom should be coming to.
Take her to meet her parents.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.799
Keep B and C together.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.068
We have
two different NICU rooms.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.837
Neither boy is crying,

07:49.970 --> 07:52.272
and co-bedding
identical-twin preemies
can be beneficial for both.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.607
That's anecdotal.

07:53.741 --> 07:54.975
Risks include poor
thermoregulation, increased--

07:55.108 --> 07:56.476
Just do it.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.651
Baby D is not crying,

08:03.784 --> 08:06.119
plus he has nevus simplex
and meconium-stained fluid.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.921
Get the heel stick
and go tell the lab it's stat.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.495
Spinal lesion covered
with sterile wet telfa.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.630
Heading to OR 2.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.765
Keep me posted.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.336
And how's the star
of our show? Baby F.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.338
Not singing yet,
but airway is clear.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.975
Take her to NICU.
Hopefully she cries soon.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.457
Hey. Hi.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.660
My hero.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.261
Where are my babies?

08:48.395 --> 08:49.663
They're in the NICU now.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.164
Except for Baby A here.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.973
She got a head start
on her siblings.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.818
Listen to those healthy lungs.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.486
Mm. First to cry.
She's an overachiever.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.328
What do you think
about Abigail?

09:21.461 --> 09:22.696
Forever Baby A.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.199
I love it. And her.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.206
How 'bout it, B?

09:33.340 --> 09:34.407
Can we get those lungs
strong enough

09:34.541 --> 09:36.376
to move you to a CPAP?

09:36.509 --> 09:38.679
You hear those studies on
co-bedding identical preemies?

09:38.812 --> 09:40.914
No. C's cyanotic.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.716
He's tachypneic and retracting.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.517
Check his liver.

09:44.652 --> 09:47.254
The research is totally shaded
by confirmation bias.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.022
Palpable three centimeters
below the costal margin.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.591
If you'd been more assertive,

09:51.725 --> 09:52.826
we wouldn't be stuck together.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.095
Systolic murmur.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.430
Why weren't <i>you</i> more assertive?

09:57.564 --> 09:59.366
If I were a surgical attending,
I would have been.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.234
I had to fight
just to be on this case.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.870
You're gonna need an echo,
chest X-ray--

10:03.003 --> 10:05.538
X-ray, BNP and C to confirm
congestive heart failure.
I know.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.174
Let's make a deal.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.942
We only talk to each other
when medically necessary.

10:09.677 --> 10:10.644
Fine.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.551
Inset the needle
in the posterior iliac crest.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.388
Later, I have to accompany Lea
to an OB-GYN appointment.

10:21.521 --> 10:25.058
Dr. Andrews will supervise you
for a few hours.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.895
- Everything okay?
- We don't know yet.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.097
Last year,
she miscarried at 22 weeks.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.365
Good precision.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.468
When Baby D was first born,

10:35.602 --> 10:38.471
you kinda took a moment.
That why?

10:40.107 --> 10:41.074
Yes.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.879
I think
I've penetrated the bone.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.414
- Syringe?
- No, you haven't.

10:47.547 --> 10:50.483
You will hear and feel a pop
when you do.

10:50.617 --> 10:51.651
Go a bit deeper.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.257
Dr. Perez,
you need to be firmer.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.591
More aggressive.

11:00.627 --> 11:01.561
Go ahead.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.002
Syringe?

11:14.808 --> 11:16.343
- Now?
- Yes.

11:16.476 --> 11:20.113
As a surgeon, you must be
decisive and aggressive.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.017
Aspirating
the bone marrow.

11:25.552 --> 11:26.754
Very good.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.322
Get it to the lab
for microscopic analysis.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.128
Good luck.

11:35.262 --> 11:38.732
With the appointment.
You'll make a great dad.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.134
You are not qualified
to make that prediction.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.680
Incision immediately
lateral to the neural placode

11:53.814 --> 11:55.482
into the epithelium.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.684
Incision tight to the placode.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.687
That method avoids leaving
the epithelials in the closure.

12:00.821 --> 12:01.922
Is the play-by-play
really necessary?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.325
It helps me to learn
by saying it out loud.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.160
It helps me to do the surgery
if you don't.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.342
You can talk.
Just not like Vin Scully.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.777
- Who's Vin Scully?
- All right, scrub out.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.980
I'm kidding. Mostly.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.520
The parents, Gena and Jack?
Heroes.

12:33.653 --> 12:36.689
We might throw that word around
just a little too easily.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.391
Think of the risk they took,

12:38.525 --> 12:40.193
bringing six new lives
into the world.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.762
Refusing to selectively reduce

12:42.896 --> 12:44.231
is what got us here
in the first place.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.699
Delivering 11 weeks pre-term

12:46.834 --> 12:48.268
is a little bit
less than ideal.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.737
Like Dr. Andrews says,

12:50.871 --> 12:52.973
we're going to beat the odds
and save them all.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.742
Well, if we pull that off,
then <i>we</i> are the heroes.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.580
Oxygenation dropped below 90.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.217
We can't turn her over
to assess or treat her lungs.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.685
We can't even do imaging.

13:08.755 --> 13:11.324
We're gonna have to
tell the parents.
Prepare them.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.230
I'll do it.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.266
Are you sure?

13:22.102 --> 13:23.403
You can't sugarcoat it.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.613
Administer 2 mils surfactant, prophylactically?

13:33.746 --> 13:36.749
No indication of RDS.
She's on minimal settings.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.952
I'd actually like to decrease
support and remove CPAP.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.788
Yeah?

13:41.922 --> 13:43.656
No reason
she can't breathe on her own
now that her airway is clear.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.966
Come on, Baby F. Deep breaths.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.607
Your basketball rival
Clay texted me.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.476
- Asked me out.
- Get out.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.612
I assure you, this guy
knows it's a real date.

14:05.745 --> 14:06.880
<i>If</i> I go.

14:07.814 --> 14:08.815
You're going.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.853
That's our girl.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.162
Baby E's lungs
are filled with fluid,

14:22.295 --> 14:24.131
and she's
in early heart failure.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.135
She may need to be reintubated,

14:29.702 --> 14:32.639
which would mean
placing her on her back.

14:32.772 --> 14:35.308
That would make it harder
for her surgical wound to heal.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.310
That doesn't sound good.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.312
She's very sick.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.583
It's possible
she may not survive.

14:46.920 --> 14:47.887
Mm.

14:50.657 --> 14:51.925
We'll pray for a miracle.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.895
It wouldn't be our first.

15:05.172 --> 15:08.675
I can arrange a visit
from the hospital chaplain
if you like.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.243
- You can baptize the baby.
- No.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.247
You're asking me to let her go.
I'm not ready to do that.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.351
You can't, either.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.020
Please.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.361
Of course.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.711
O2 sats improving.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.946
Way to go, Baby B.
You'll be shouting in no time.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.255
Tell me you're not on Tinder.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.458
You're in violation of
the medicine-only agreement
that you proposed.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.893
And I'm not on Tinder.

16:01.028 --> 16:04.031
My baby's on the mend.
Yours is the one
with the heart problem.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.398
Don't be afraid
to ask for help.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.636
Then what's with all
the handsome dudes' faces
you're scrolling through?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.206
Your screen
is reflected in the window.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.776
Not that it's any of
your business, Columbo,

16:16.909 --> 16:19.012
but they're not dates.
They're donors.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.913
Organ donors?
Finally getting a heart?

16:21.048 --> 16:22.715
Mm. Sperm.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.618
Oh.

16:25.752 --> 16:26.853
Yeah. "Oh."

16:32.325 --> 16:34.627
Snowman sign
on the chest X-ray.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.164
It could be TAPVR,
transposition of
the great vessels,

16:37.297 --> 16:39.632
Ebstein anomaly,
or pulmonary atresia.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.834
I don't see
differential cyanosis.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.204
That rules out transposition
of the great vessels.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.538
No boot-shaped heart, either.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.506
Or gallop.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.508
So it is TAPVR.

16:49.942 --> 16:50.843
Which we can fix.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.448
I'll get the parents' consent
and book an OR right away.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.052
Thanks for the help.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.593
- Lucky I was a match.
- Yes.

17:06.726 --> 17:11.731
As Baby D's father,
there was only a 38.5% chance
you'd be a bone-marrow match.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.566
Why are you here?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.535
Being on your feet
promotes blood flow,

17:15.668 --> 17:18.338
and she wanted to be
with her husband.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.006
I'm just glad
I can do <i>something.</i>

17:20.140 --> 17:22.842
Gena's handled
all the heavy lifting
for our family.

17:22.975 --> 17:24.877
You have no idea how hard
this kind of stuff can be.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.246
I do.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.715
My wife and I have also
struggled to have a child.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.851
Modern medicine's a miracle.

17:31.984 --> 17:32.985
I hope
you'll be blessed like us.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.487
I hope so, too.

17:35.688 --> 17:36.723
But not <i>as</i> blessed.

17:41.361 --> 17:44.564
I will insert the large
bore needle into your hip now.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.266
Ugh. I hate needles.

17:47.834 --> 17:48.568
How'd you two meet?

17:49.502 --> 17:50.803
He was my prom date.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.005
Been together ever since?

17:53.140 --> 17:54.574
Uh, no.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.844
Gena ran off
to New York for a decade
to join the City Ballet.

17:57.977 --> 18:01.881
Until I broke my ankle,
ended my career, came home.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.384
We reconnected at our
ten-year high school reunion.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.254
It was like no time had passed.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.855
I never forgot her.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.857
I never
forgot you, either.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.159
Done!

18:14.594 --> 18:16.229
You get me
yammering on about Gena,

18:16.363 --> 18:18.198
and I barely even notice
a needle going into my bone.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.066
You did great.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.702
We'll get this to the lab
and then transfuse it
into Baby D right away.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.540
Nice work in there.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.142
Baby C
should be crying in no time.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.913
Are you sure you want to
raise a baby on your own?

18:37.584 --> 18:39.686
Because I'm too careerist
to be a good mom?

18:39.819 --> 18:41.087
Like I was too ambitious
to be a good girlfriend?

18:41.221 --> 18:42.222
No.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.626
You'll love your kid
more than any job or partner.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.928
I sure do.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.531
But if you don't have the guy
when you have the kid,

18:51.664 --> 18:52.965
he might be tough to find.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.370
I shouldn't have a kid
'cause I may never find a man?

18:58.905 --> 19:00.106
Okay, caveman.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.409
Well, I never said
I wouldn't date a single mom,

19:02.542 --> 19:04.344
but I am remarkably sensitive.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.012
I want a kid,
and I'm done waiting.

19:07.780 --> 19:08.615
See you back in the NICU.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.693
She's improving.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.594
And hungry.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.597
All ready for some colostrum.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.301
Did you text Clay back yet?

19:28.435 --> 19:31.971
After this, we can start
introducing a pacifier.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.607
I didn't have sex for 17 months
after I lost my leg.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.943
And then,
when I did, I thought,

19:37.076 --> 19:40.847
"Oh, yeah. I remember this.
It's awesome."

19:40.980 --> 19:43.182
It's a first date. I'm not
even thinking about sex.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.317
Liar.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.354
These make
these chairs that glide.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.322
And wedges.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.190
This is not a death sentence
to your sex life.

19:51.324 --> 19:55.194
Okay, I will text him back,
mostly to stop
this conversation.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.930
- Hmm.
- But it's just dinner.

19:58.064 --> 19:58.831
For now.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.570
Damn. She's not tolerating
the colostrum.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.137
I haven't started it yet.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.645
So you guys ready
to start trying again?

20:12.779 --> 20:15.815
Oh, yes. We put up
a calendar this morning.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.750
And practiced.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.486
I think she gets it, Shaun.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.757
Visualizing the uterine wall.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.663
That's scar tissue.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.033
That sounds bad.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.369
It's from
the fetoscopic surgery

20:36.503 --> 20:38.571
and D and C
after your miscarriage.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.674
You should do a hysteroscopy
to remove the adhesions.

20:42.542 --> 20:43.476
Thank you, Dr. Murphy.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.247
He's right.
Uh, we can attempt that, but--

20:48.381 --> 20:49.716
You have Asherman's Syndrome.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.388
Most likely, yes.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.658
Well, can--
Can we still start trying?

20:59.359 --> 21:00.693
I wouldn't advise it.

21:02.995 --> 21:06.433
How much longer
do we have to wait?

21:06.566 --> 21:08.535
I recommend
continuing birth control.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.203
Getting pregnant right now
wouldn't be safe for you

21:11.338 --> 21:12.271
or the baby.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.612
When will it be safe?

21:20.547 --> 21:21.714
Maybe another year?

21:22.214 --> 21:23.215
Maybe two.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.719
Maybe never.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.480
Severe edema,

21:53.613 --> 21:56.783
fluid in the lungs,
but no obstructions,
just as we expected.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.819
So we've eliminated
brain, spine, abdomen,
anything congenital.

22:02.021 --> 22:02.789
I shouldn't have
let you talk to them.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.458
Miracles? Really?

22:06.593 --> 22:07.494
I was direct and honest.

22:07.627 --> 22:08.928
How's that being honest?

22:09.061 --> 22:10.530
They think
there's a chance here.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.599
As long as she's breathing,
her heart is beating,

22:12.732 --> 22:14.901
her brain is functioning,
there's still hope.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.969
This infant
is under two pounds,

22:17.103 --> 22:20.306
eleven weeks premature,
with a major birth defect.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.510
She's more than likely
too small, too weak,
and too sick to survive.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.083
Stop being a cheerleader.
Start being a doctor.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.224
O2 sats and heart rate
are improving.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.361
Come on, dude. Cry for me.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.664
You got this.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.666
Who's a star?

22:46.799 --> 22:50.202
Baby B is.
He's coming off the vent.

22:50.336 --> 22:52.805
Yes, you are.
And then you're gonna wail.

22:52.939 --> 22:55.708
Those guys you were
looking at earlier,

22:55.842 --> 22:57.577
how much
do you really know about them?

22:57.710 --> 22:59.479
You'd be surprised.

22:59.612 --> 23:02.982
Well, besides their
physical attributes
and what diseases they carry.

23:03.115 --> 23:06.519
Genetics can also determine
your sense of humor,
your values--

23:06.653 --> 23:07.954
You want me
to have the sperm bank

23:08.087 --> 23:09.556
ask them all to write
a knock-knock joke

23:09.689 --> 23:11.190
and an answer
to the trolley problem?

23:11.323 --> 23:12.692
Or ask me.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.196
I'm not suggesting
I'd be the kid's dad.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.198
I just want to help.

23:19.331 --> 23:20.066
No strings attached.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.573
Uh, Baby B's on CPAP.
O2 sats rising.

23:26.706 --> 23:27.840
Hope to hear a cry soon.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.443
Excellent.
Still no cry from C, either?

23:32.479 --> 23:33.746
Okay. Scope the baby.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.015
TAPVR repair may
have caused vocal cord palsy.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.760
No missed
or new obstructive issues.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.428
Upper airway's clean.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.997
Why are her O2 sats plummeting?

23:51.130 --> 23:52.599
Could be some sort of fistula,

23:52.732 --> 23:54.066
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

23:54.200 --> 23:54.934
RDS.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.369
Or it could be neurological.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.741
She's too fragile
to start testing blind.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.779
I'll stay with her.
Put her back on CPAP.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.180
I'll put together
a full differential.

24:08.314 --> 24:09.281
Eat something
while you're at it.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.823
Marrow transplant
seems to be working,

24:16.956 --> 24:18.791
but I couldn't pass
the NG tube into the stomach.

24:19.592 --> 24:20.793
How'd the appointment go?

24:22.929 --> 24:23.896
Not well.

24:25.331 --> 24:26.098
Are you okay?

24:28.601 --> 24:29.802
No.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.642
How long has he been drooling?

24:35.775 --> 24:38.210
I don't know.
I... thought that was normal.

24:38.344 --> 24:41.247
- It's not.
- Any luck with the NG tube?

24:41.380 --> 24:45.151
No. That is a symptom.
This baby cannot swallow.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.587
He has a congenial
tracheoesophageal fistula.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.921
We need to operate.

24:52.625 --> 24:53.926
Camera is in position.

24:55.628 --> 24:58.130
Fistula's between
the distal esophagus
and the trachea.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.331
You were right.

24:59.465 --> 25:02.301
I know.
Now reconnect the esophagus.

25:02.434 --> 25:04.203
Forceps.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.938
Repositioning
thoracoscope.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.940
Got it.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.142
Mobilizing the esophagus
to the level of the trachea.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.078
Have you
already isolated the fistula?

25:12.211 --> 25:13.145
Yes.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.848
I didn't
tell you to do that.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.217
- Uh...
- You should have
first mobilized

25:18.350 --> 25:20.653
the proximal pouch
of the esophagus.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.088
I'm s-- I'm so-- I'm sorry.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.790
You may have interrupted
the blood supply.

25:23.923 --> 25:27.093
The risk of anastomosis leaks
and tissue breakdown
are greater now.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.961
Give me the instrument.

25:29.095 --> 25:29.962
Step back.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.632
Move.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.468
Take the camera.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.540
Suturing.

25:43.943 --> 25:44.977
Is he gonna be okay?

25:46.813 --> 25:47.880
I don't know.

26:00.492 --> 26:03.062
When I said "yes" to dinner,
I didn't mean tonight.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.231
Patience is not
my greatest virtue.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.835
I'm in the middle
of this preemie case.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.002
So you fasting until it's done?

26:22.982 --> 26:24.150
Brought your favorite.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.384
Roast chicken.

26:25.517 --> 26:28.487
Oh. It's like the first time
you asked me out.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.022
Mm-hmm.

26:31.924 --> 26:32.859
She's breathing on her own.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.461
Nice.

26:35.594 --> 26:39.165
I don't envy anyone
who has to try to sleep
in a house with six infants.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.834
- Mm-hmm.
- No matter how cute they are.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.035
I feel that way about one.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.038
Oh.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.041
Are you opposed to kids?

26:50.342 --> 26:51.744
I mean, not politically.

26:52.511 --> 26:53.479
But?

26:59.085 --> 27:01.253
I'm not sure
I want any of my own.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.224
Is that bad?

27:07.526 --> 27:08.895
Being one of four, I...

27:12.231 --> 27:14.233
I always saw myself
with a big family.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.069
Being one of eight,

27:18.137 --> 27:19.672
pretty much why
I don't want one.

27:27.847 --> 27:31.217
Ice Cube, Guy Fieri, Tom Hanks.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.186
- Everybody loves Hanks.
- Not Tom Hanks.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.022
Raider Nation
is deep and eclectic.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.957
I promise
I don't paint my face.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.091
Unless it's the playoffs.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.160
Oh. So only one day per decade.

27:41.293 --> 27:44.263
Okay.
Opposite sides of the Bay.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.132
That's why they have a bridge.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.667
I can't believe you were
actually there for "The Catch."

27:48.801 --> 27:50.870
Were you sitting
on that side of the field
where Clark caught it?

27:55.641 --> 27:56.976
Yep. You're distracted.

27:58.945 --> 28:00.112
Want to walk me
through your case so far?

28:03.482 --> 28:06.218
EXIT procedure for CHAOS.
Cyst was decompressed.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.721
We weaned her off CPAP,
O2 sats improved,

28:08.855 --> 28:10.056
then started crashing.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.058
Not sure why.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.692
Pass me the ghost pepper sauce,
would ya?

28:13.826 --> 28:16.528
Ooh. Feel like that stuff's
gonna burn a hole in my chest.

28:16.662 --> 28:18.130
What if your preemie's
breathing troubles

28:18.264 --> 28:19.698
aren't from above?
What if it's from below?

28:23.002 --> 28:24.136
Diaphragmatic hernia.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.473
Could allow the baby's
lower organs to protrude

28:27.606 --> 28:29.141
into her chest,
crowd her lungs.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.978
If it started
as a small defect,

28:32.111 --> 28:34.546
we could easily miss it
on ultrasound with all
the crowding in that womb.

28:34.680 --> 28:35.714
Mm-hmm.

28:36.983 --> 28:40.486
Smart, handsome,
<i>and</i> you brought me food.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.488
I might actually let you
take me out on a real date.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.290
This is a real date.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.225
I mean,
it will be once we kiss.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.033
Then we should probably
do that now.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.836
My thought exactly.

29:13.719 --> 29:15.354
Thank you for your offer.

29:16.322 --> 29:17.189
But?

29:20.126 --> 29:22.228
It would hurt too much
to see you every time
I looked at my kid.

29:37.844 --> 29:40.279
The live birth rate
in pregnancies

29:40.412 --> 29:43.816
after Asherman's treatment
is 67%.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.051
She should have mentioned that.

29:47.920 --> 29:48.888
Yeah. I guess so.

29:50.857 --> 29:54.226
And hysteroscopy

29:54.360 --> 29:56.228
improves the odds
of conception.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.233
Our prognosis for conception
may still be very good.

30:05.171 --> 30:08.240
I'm "sending good vibes
into the universe,
so good things come back."

30:09.976 --> 30:11.143
Thank you, Shaun.

30:13.745 --> 30:14.746
Maybe later.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.650
Right now I'm just very sad.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.326
I know.

30:44.576 --> 30:45.611
O2 sats are falling.

30:45.744 --> 30:47.279
I need suction
and a ventilator.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.781
Page Andrews.
She's bradycardic.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.283
She's not getting
enough oxygen.

31:23.815 --> 31:24.683
Just forgot to breathe.

31:50.476 --> 31:51.343
It's not gonna save this child.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.145
Hypnagogia.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.684
Thomas Edison believed
the thoughts generated
as we drift off to sleep

31:58.817 --> 32:00.686
were the most likely
to generate a breakthrough.

32:00.819 --> 32:03.589
All right, Thomas Edison,
the Wizard of Menlo Park,

32:03.722 --> 32:06.725
the same guy who believed
that if he sat on a goose egg,

32:06.858 --> 32:10.062
he could actually make
the goose egg hatch.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.331
There was an experiment
published in <i>Science.</i>

32:12.464 --> 32:14.433
Subjects tried to solve
a difficult math problem

32:14.566 --> 32:16.868
late at night
while holding something heavy.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.570
When they drifted off to sleep,
they dropped it,

32:18.704 --> 32:20.639
and when they woke up,
they solved the problem.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.474
Okay, when I go to bed tonight,

32:22.608 --> 32:25.377
I'll cuddle with a barbell
while holding
onto a light bulb. How's that?

32:26.912 --> 32:27.913
Any breakthroughs on Baby E?

32:28.047 --> 32:29.748
We've exhausted
all our options.

32:29.881 --> 32:32.318
We're moving on
to "watch and wait."

32:32.451 --> 32:33.986
We were just talking
about hypnagogia.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.588
The Edison sleep theory
from <i>Science</i> magazine?

32:36.722 --> 32:38.690
Thought we might stay all night

32:38.824 --> 32:40.592
and take turns
waking each other.

32:40.726 --> 32:44.963
- Well, that's--
- Absurd? Silly? Ridiculous?

32:45.097 --> 32:48.134
I was gonna say that's better
than "watch and wait."

33:03.882 --> 33:07.119
You were right. Baby F
has a diaphragmatic hernia.

33:07.253 --> 33:09.121
It didn't show up
in the initial X-ray.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.222
Anybody would have missed it.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.923
It was Clay's idea.

33:13.559 --> 33:14.893
I'm glad that I texted him
to bring you dinner.

33:16.295 --> 33:17.296
You did not.

33:17.429 --> 33:18.497
I did.

33:19.898 --> 33:20.866
Well played.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.805
After we get consent,
you can scrub in,

33:26.938 --> 33:28.740
help me make
that little girl all better.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.701
- Hypnagogia!
- Ahh! What?

33:59.605 --> 34:01.473
The groin.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.842
- What?
- The groin?

34:03.975 --> 34:07.779
If we can't access
the baby's chest,
we can check the groin.

34:07.913 --> 34:10.382
If she has bounding
femoral pulses--

34:10.516 --> 34:13.119
It would indicate
a patent ductus arteriosus.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.121
Which would explain the fluid
in her lungs and the--

34:15.254 --> 34:17.956
the heart failure,
which could be fixed
with a Piccolo Occluder.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.260
Go get consent. And an aspirin.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.529
Uh, wait.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.565
What is it?

34:26.698 --> 34:28.200
If we can't
put the baby on her back,

34:28.334 --> 34:29.535
how are we gonna
insert the device?

34:35.341 --> 34:36.342
I'll get comfortable.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.145
You scream in my face
this time.

34:41.980 --> 34:43.515
He's swallowing now.

34:43.649 --> 34:44.983
But still not crying.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.320
Ready to show your brother
how it's done?

35:09.007 --> 35:11.009
Very polite of you
to wait for your brother.

35:12.711 --> 35:15.547
Maybe there <i>was</i> something to
that shady co-bedding research.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.250
Maybe you being a wuss
was a blessing in disguise.

35:24.556 --> 35:27.125
It would have hurt me, too,

35:27.259 --> 35:29.561
having a kid with you
and not being part
of your lives.

35:38.069 --> 35:41.740
Gaining access through
the umbilical vessels,
that was inspiring.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.875
- I credit Thomas Edison.
- As you should.

35:48.180 --> 35:53.084
Seriously, thank you
for humoring my crazy idea,
Dr. Glassman.

35:53.219 --> 35:56.121
Thank you for helping me
to not give up on hope.

36:05.264 --> 36:05.997
Come on, buddy.

36:07.132 --> 36:08.600
Let me hear that cry.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.974
Heart rate 110 BPM.
Respiratory 65.

36:18.810 --> 36:19.645
Look. I'm so sorry.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.315
I thought I was...
being decisive.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.384
You were.

36:26.752 --> 36:27.986
It was the wrong decision.

36:55.180 --> 36:56.815
He will be okay.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.820
You should feel bad,
but not too bad.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.497
Sextuplet births
are incredibly rare,

37:12.631 --> 37:15.200
one in almost four billion,

37:15.334 --> 37:19.971
and the odds of 100% survival
are even rarer.

37:20.105 --> 37:22.808
But I'm happy to report
all six babies are healthy

37:22.941 --> 37:25.210
and all six babies
will be going home.
