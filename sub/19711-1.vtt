01:20.454 --> 01:23.657
I want to go to Mars

01:24.507 --> 01:28.384
Not just a visit
I want to live there

01:29.195 --> 01:32.470
It is then as believe in truth
that life on mars

01:32.840 --> 01:36.958
Is possible..
Proof that if we had to

01:37.366 --> 01:40.506
Mankind can make a fresh start

01:41.550 --> 01:44.367
We are in trouble
and it's our fault

01:44.662 --> 01:48.961
and we're running out of time
and mother nature doesn't negotiate

01:49.444 --> 01:52.478
we can't give up, not now

01:52.915 --> 01:58.165
Mars is a planet
Right and ready for life

01:58.447 --> 02:04.408
Earth's resources might be depleted but
there is one resource we must never neglect

02:05.534 --> 02:07.038
It's the most valuable

02:07.973 --> 02:10.836
And it's the one without limits

02:12.771 --> 02:13.987
Courage

02:23.507 --> 02:25.231
I wrote those words

02:26.046 --> 02:29.638
I wrote those words
when I was 12 a years old

02:29.859 --> 02:31.815
My letter to the white house

02:31.971 --> 02:35.151
Never did I imagine The President
would read them loud to Nation

02:35.421 --> 02:37.600
Mourning the loss of the another
crew of the astronauts

02:37.817 --> 02:39.687
Never did I dreamed

02:39.956 --> 02:44.279
That I would be proclaimed
and emblem of fortitude

02:44.451 --> 02:47.677
The Young man
with the singular version

02:48.293 --> 02:51.761
and the rest is, well,
It's not history

02:52.818 --> 02:54.190
Just the beginning

02:58.681 --> 03:00.624
Here we all are.

03:00.801 --> 03:03.865
Thanks to Genesis
space technologies...

03:03.962 --> 03:08.880
in 20 hours The Magellan 61 will travel
6 astronauts to Mars

03:09.057 --> 03:14.146
not to visit but to live there
the first true citizens of Mars

03:17.041 --> 03:21.898
From a childhood vision to the greatest
spacing gather the world has ever attempted

03:22.061 --> 03:25.947
The settlement known as East Texas Mars

03:31.522 --> 03:36.372
Come on say it with me
"Just Add Water"

03:41.964 --> 03:44.126
Well whatever I am...

03:44.299 --> 03:49.852
I can not begin to compare
to these 6 heroes

03:50.029 --> 03:54.702
Living examples of courage without limits

03:55.524 --> 04:00.928
And on that note I would like to hand
things off to the mission head with this

04:01.085 --> 04:03.566
historic expedition,

04:03.727 --> 04:08.239
Lead Astronaut Sarah Elliot

04:25.286 --> 04:28.367
Sorry if we only have time
for a couple of questions.

04:28.528 --> 04:30.559
You know what it's like
the night before a trip

04:32.567 --> 04:35.225
Scott Hubbard, Aerospace Times.
Miss Elliot,

04:35.767 --> 04:40.943
how does is feel to sacrifice?
The next four years of your life

04:41.112 --> 04:44.311
It's not a sacrifice
It's an opportunity

04:44.487 --> 04:47.330
I feel... I feel humbled

04:47.595 --> 04:50.793
excited and greatful for the chance
to be a pioneer

04:59.131 --> 05:03.651
Miss Elliot aren't you scared?
Given the history, given the dangers?

05:04.473 --> 05:05.549
Of course

05:06.412 --> 05:09.787
I'm scared that I might let the mission
down in some way

05:11.346 --> 05:17.106
I was taught that people who took
risks with out fear were brave

05:17.234 --> 05:20.690
or far braver those who
take risk despite their fear

05:21.773 --> 05:24.388
Courage is fear that has said it's prayers

06:03.573 --> 06:08.278
T minus ten, nine, eight...

06:08.374 --> 06:14.230
seven, six, five, four...

06:14.415 --> 06:19.917
three, two, one, zero.

06:20.894 --> 06:24.289
Ignition. Launch.

07:03.259 --> 07:06.619
Stand by for docking
to Mars transfer vehicle

07:09.484 --> 07:11.281
Shuttle speed is good.

07:11.435 --> 07:12.922
Watch your drift Sarah.

07:16.427 --> 07:17.626
Contact.

07:17.802 --> 07:20.186
Not yet, not yet.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.954
Mounted manual grip.

07:34.027 --> 07:36.384
- Let's go, come on!
- Let's go.

07:44.248 --> 07:50.002
TWO MONTHS LATER

08:23.905 --> 08:26.454
You okay?
Yeah I'm fine

08:29.903 --> 08:32.582
Sarah, can I have a word?
What's up?

08:35.440 --> 08:36.953
Show it to me

08:48.187 --> 08:50.552
We can't just turn the
mission around correct?

08:51.481 --> 08:54.167
Doctor, how is she doing anyway?
You mean besides from being mortified?

08:54.242 --> 08:57.057
She is fine
Oh this is a disaster

08:57.185 --> 08:59.213
Nathaniel, she's due shortly after
they arrive.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.120
We need to get out in front of this

09:01.347 --> 09:03.059
An astronaut behaved irresponsibly and

09:03.155 --> 09:05.686
NASA will make a decision what
to do as soon as the baby is born

09:05.877 --> 09:09.538
- Decision about what?
- About when to bring them back

09:10.268 --> 09:13.010
Tom, this is a bigger issue here

09:13.172 --> 09:17.995
Subjecting a foetus to zero gravity
during it's entire gestation

09:18.156 --> 09:20.187
It's unchartered territory

09:28.548 --> 09:31.363
We don't go to press
we keep this internal for now

09:31.524 --> 09:34.109
we need to gather more information
What are you saying?

09:34.285 --> 09:37.910
I'm saying we go short term contingency
we have Dr Loh deliver the baby on Mars

09:38.068 --> 09:41.758
we keep this quite
we wait this out

09:41.862 --> 09:45.725
Sarah may have behaved irresponsibly
but she's no longer just an astronaut...

09:45.887 --> 09:50.848
and it's not just a genesis decision
She is...

09:52.190 --> 09:53.709
A mother now..

09:56.256 --> 09:58.044
It's her decision too.

10:47.968 --> 10:51.179
Push push push

10:51.336 --> 10:56.232
Well done. Take a deep breath, here we go.
Push push push..

10:57.512 --> 10:59.304
Okay, good

10:59.466 --> 11:01.497
Keep breathing. You're doing great.

11:01.658 --> 11:05.467
One final push.
- Take a deep breath.

11:10.434 --> 11:13.268
Is he okay?
Well done..

11:16.874 --> 11:18.882
He looks good.

11:39.775 --> 11:42.991
Sarah? Sarah? Pulse zero?
Her heart rate's dropping.

11:44.389 --> 11:48.076
Push two milligrams of lorazepam.
Take it easy.

11:56.847 --> 11:59.808
- She is still not responding.
- Give her 20 milligrams.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.167
Come on, Sarah, breathe.

12:15.983 --> 12:18.353
- How long?
- Thirty minutes without a heartbeat.

12:18.510 --> 12:21.275
Stop. Stop CPR.

12:21.371 --> 12:23.790
She's gone. She's gone.

12:47.281 --> 12:48.969
Mr. Shepherd,

12:50.183 --> 12:51.277
are you there?

12:52.466 --> 12:53.683
We lost her.

13:22.163 --> 13:25.123
Okay, here is what we know

13:25.284 --> 13:28.645
2/3 rd less gravity
will alter the child's internal organs

13:28.806 --> 13:32.079
The heart will simply not be conditioned
to have the strength to

13:32.175 --> 13:34.455
pump in the earth's gravity

13:34.646 --> 13:37.227
Bones will be brittle
Probably oversized

13:37.405 --> 13:39.291
The child will never survive
the trip back to earth'

13:39.314 --> 13:41.557
Yeah but Nathaniel in the eyes of the world

13:41.805 --> 13:46.516
Isn't this whole mission East Texas
an experiment? Wouldn't it be forgiven

13:46.612 --> 13:50.964
Tom, this is not a mouse
This is not a monkey

13:51.126 --> 13:53.230
This is a human being
and in the eyes of the world...

13:53.406 --> 13:56.475
The lead astronaut with the
Genesis Mars mission not only got pregnant

13:56.622 --> 13:58.846
but died in child birth...

13:59.038 --> 14:01.997
sentencing a baby to a
motherless existence in outer space,

14:02.128 --> 14:04.662
Imagine the bloody outcry

14:04.824 --> 14:09.129
East Texas runs on
money science good face...

14:09.286 --> 14:11.729
and above all, good PR.

14:12.225 --> 14:14.958
Remember we're talking about a secret
we're talking about a cover up

14:15.569 --> 14:17.527
It will bring the company down.

14:19.847 --> 14:22.719
- Unless...
- Unless what?

14:23.806 --> 14:29.343
Unless we don't cover up we take full
responsibility we face it head on.

14:29.717 --> 14:30.676
Chuck

14:32.666 --> 14:35.112
I want to on the next mission
As a passenger? Yes

14:35.288 --> 14:37.370
Nathaniel, for the love of God.. Here we go

14:37.546 --> 14:40.001
No, Actually he's right.
There would be no better show of support

14:40.050 --> 14:41.099
Thank you, Alice. Exactly,

14:41.260 --> 14:44.022
Can you imagine their morale right now.
They have just lost their leader.

14:44.107 --> 14:47.297
Nathaniel it is out of the question
And you know it

14:49.931 --> 14:54.281
Am I missing something here?
Doctor, will you enlighten Alice please?

14:54.931 --> 14:56.544
Hydrocephalus

14:57.105 --> 14:59.724
We founded on Mr Sephard's
very first medical

14:59.938 --> 15:01.564
a congenital brain disorder

15:01.946 --> 15:02.118
It's basically benign...

15:02.142 --> 15:04.779
Benign, Unless he wants to go
into outer space and then

15:04.971 --> 15:08.683
I wanna find willing to take that risk
Sorry not happening

15:15.050 --> 15:17.684
So the child remains on Mars?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.193
I don't see any...

15:23.964 --> 15:26.435
We don't have a choice.

15:26.613 --> 15:30.558
Say we come clean
and we loose our financing.

15:30.715 --> 15:33.184
Say we..we..
We give up

15:33.342 --> 15:34.660
everything we fought for

15:34.852 --> 15:36.078
Say we bring everyone home

15:36.078 --> 15:38.586
You've heard the doctor that
the child wouldn't even make the trip

15:41.333 --> 15:44.966
keeping this a secret
saves the company...

15:45.135 --> 15:49.405
which saves East Texas,
which saves the child

15:52.255 --> 15:54.405
So the child remains classified?

15:58.295 --> 15:59.351
Yes

16:01.790 --> 16:04.536
I'm sorry. Yes.

16:20.961 --> 16:22.778
Can I bring your car around Mr shepherd?

25:12.108 --> 25:16.140
The study lab is over. Gotta go.
See you in the funny papers

25:16.268 --> 25:18.748
What does that mean?

25:18.844 --> 25:21.427
You always say that. What does it mean?

25:21.570 --> 25:25.340
I do not know. I had a foster sister in
Oklahoma who used to say it all the time.

25:25.468 --> 25:29.411
Just different way of saying 'goodbye'.
I like it. Talk tomorrow?

25:32.053 --> 25:33.965
I'm not going anywhere.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.561
Where did you get this movie?

25:59.707 --> 26:02.232
One of the German scientists
who was here last month.

26:05.378 --> 26:08.687
How do you know what's going on?
- Excuse me, please?

26:08.827 --> 26:11.288
Excuse me?
- It's easy

26:11.384 --> 26:13.826
You see those men there? They are angels.

26:13.984 --> 26:16.898
They look over the people on earth
and make sure they are okay.

26:17.025 --> 26:18.384
Do you see that angel?

26:18.560 --> 26:23.264
He is gonna fall in love with her
and fall to earth.

26:24.543 --> 26:26.762
You're a romantic.

26:26.943 --> 26:30.967
Then he won't be an angel anymore.
He'll be just like her.

27:18.301 --> 27:22.302
Hey, Tulsa, give us even a ride, you slut.

28:05.741 --> 28:09.500
What up, Chuck? Don't get up because of me.

28:11.516 --> 28:13.978
"Hi, honey, how was your day?
Making new friends yet?"

28:14.139 --> 28:17.475
Oh you... boy am I fighting 'em off?

28:17.644 --> 28:20.708
I'm the most popular girl in my class.

28:20.889 --> 28:23.481
Did you get Thursday's check yet?
I would not want you...

28:23.665 --> 28:26.691
Wait a second. It's Thursday. Hey, hey
Chuck, Chuck, wake up.

28:26.852 --> 28:29.947
You gotta do the Sanders farm.
Hey come on, wake up.

28:31.841 --> 28:35.987
You have one single property.
Pretty simple alright? 15 minutes tops.

28:52.578 --> 28:53.633
DISARMED

29:25.336 --> 29:27.233
Okay, the starter.

29:31.734 --> 29:34.325
Try the brakes.
It doesn't have brakes.

29:34.886 --> 29:36.833
Alright Check the sprays.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.736
- Checked
- Not while I'm standing behind the plane.

29:41.894 --> 29:45.718
Ok, we are gonna loose some
of the property. You do it.

29:46.344 --> 29:49.326
You can fly this thing. You do it.

29:50.805 --> 29:56.277
Awesome parenting, seriously
Risk my life for a 190 plucks.

29:56.439 --> 29:58.700
Good to know how my life is worth to you.

31:11.772 --> 31:13.569
- Help
- It's okay. I got you.

31:18.464 --> 31:22.512
You're okay. You're okay.
I'm right here.

31:24.850 --> 31:28.832
Are you insane? Do you think that the
protocol does not apply to you?

31:28.928 --> 31:32.411
You could have caused an atmospheric
breach, not to mention die.

31:32.583 --> 31:35.462
No body rides unaccompanied,
no matter who they are

31:37.160 --> 31:39.886
Gardner, What is going on here?
This is not like you.

31:40.049 --> 31:42.559
You wouldn't understand.
My mother is out there.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.624
How did you get past the electronic lock?

31:45.528 --> 31:47.282
That magnetic implant

31:47.432 --> 31:50.348
is there to monitor the growth of
your organs. It doesn't serve as a pass key

31:50.585 --> 31:55.480
- And how do you even learn how to do that?
- Raised by scientists in a bubble.

32:12.545 --> 32:13.601
Open.

32:18.941 --> 32:21.240
That plaque for your mother

32:21.240 --> 32:23.219
is just a piece of metal in the ground.
Okay?

32:24.525 --> 32:27.224
Her ashes was spread
across the Pacific Ocean.

32:28.207 --> 32:29.958
You deserve to know that.

32:32.300 --> 32:34.964
She's not out there, Gardner.

32:36.447 --> 32:37.918
She is in you.

32:44.127 --> 32:46.580
I do not like to go to sleep
with us in a fight.

32:48.366 --> 32:50.108
We are not in a fight.

33:28.937 --> 33:31.179
This is how you greet an old friend?

33:31.364 --> 33:33.434
If he is unannounced, yes.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.379
It's about the boy.

33:38.291 --> 33:42.257
Mr. Shepherd, you have no idea
how smart he is.

33:42.434 --> 33:47.115
He is being denied connection.
Not to do this at this point

33:48.040 --> 33:49.673
I'm sorry. It would be inhumane.

33:49.857 --> 33:52.257
Miss Wayne, I am touched by your concern,
I really am...

33:52.449 --> 33:56.715
But none of this matters, if he
can't survive. We have been through this.

33:56.872 --> 33:58.729
For starters we will have to add

33:58.729 --> 34:01.394
carbon nanotubes to strengthen
his bone density.

34:01.586 --> 34:05.984
It's a very complex procedure.
It's, it;s... Too risky. I'm Sorry.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.234
Tom, I can not sign on to this.

34:08.391 --> 34:11.889
With all due respect, Nathaniel,
I am not asking. I am telling.

34:12.039 --> 34:16.003
You've been gone for 16 years.
- Have you run this one NASA?

34:16.099 --> 34:18.907
NASA has always felt conflicted over this.

34:19.072 --> 34:22.141
They want to do the right thing,
which this is.

34:22.333 --> 34:24.728
They want to bring the boy home.

34:26.473 --> 34:29.119
Look, This is our chance
to turn bad PR to good PR.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.271
This has nothing to do with PR.
I'm talking about a boy's life.

34:32.447 --> 34:35.688
Hang on, hang on. Like it or not,
but I'm still the founder.

34:35.844 --> 34:39.520
Like it or not,
East Texas is still my brainchild.

34:40.199 --> 34:43.391
You know, you got a lot more faith
in how the public will respond than I do.

34:53.293 --> 34:54.813
I have some news.

35:00.055 --> 35:01.150
Guess what.

35:03.757 --> 35:06.273
You are taking me to Bora-Bora?

35:06.369 --> 35:08.675
That was a joke. As you were.

35:09.175 --> 35:11.855
They may have found a cure for my disease.

35:12.013 --> 35:15.092
Okay, Mine was closer to the truth.

35:15.253 --> 35:17.166
But mine is the truth.

35:17.999 --> 35:20.956
It will involve an operation.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.814
And some physical therapy.

35:22.972 --> 35:26.996
Pick it up, Pick it up,
you got it, keep going. there you go.

35:27.157 --> 35:28.423
Remember why are you running for.

35:33.373 --> 35:36.933
Assuming all goes well,
I'll be coming to see you.

35:38.757 --> 35:41.518
Cool, and when is this happening?

35:41.652 --> 35:44.340
In a few months.
There is a longer travelling.

35:44.501 --> 35:48.395
Do not take forever. Once the
foster care spits me out, I'm gone.

35:50.315 --> 35:52.292
See you in the flying papers.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.937
File 32: human courtship.

36:01.973 --> 36:03.731
Here we are. Allow me?

36:03.892 --> 36:07.770
Well, I guess chivalry not entirely dead.
At least not in Nantucket.

36:07.917 --> 36:11.138
"At least not in Nantucket." Repeat.

36:11.914 --> 36:14.955
Here we are. Allow me, won't you?

36:15.117 --> 36:20.553
Well, I guess chivalry not entirely dead
at least not in Nantucket.

36:20.714 --> 36:23.114
Bravo. Well done.

36:51.114 --> 36:53.153
Are you gonna visit your ex-husband?

36:55.768 --> 36:58.302
I've hacked into the scientist's records.

36:58.472 --> 37:01.010
You are the clever computer stalker.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.760
Why did you get divorced?

37:04.865 --> 37:07.929
He changed when he found out
we couldn't have children.

37:09.415 --> 37:12.479
Did that make you sad that
you could not have children?

37:13.846 --> 37:15.704
That's a tough one.

37:15.808 --> 37:17.846
It meant I did not have to choose.

37:17.966 --> 37:21.629
Motherhood was not a dream
I was chasing at that time

37:31.029 --> 37:33.605
My father is somewhere on that thing.

37:35.007 --> 37:37.949
Earth. We could go and find him.

37:38.110 --> 37:42.088
We do not have to tell him who I am.
I could just see him.

37:42.245 --> 37:45.639
Maybe I can ask for the time.
No one has to know.

37:46.484 --> 37:49.933
- Do you know where he lives?
- No.

37:50.029 --> 37:51.572
His name?

37:51.748 --> 37:55.638
Gardner, I promise, I don't know
anything about him. Nobody does.

37:59.789 --> 38:03.317
How am I supposed to act on Earth?
With the people.

38:32.362 --> 38:33.668
Mr. Shepherd?

38:37.788 --> 38:39.148
Your coffee.

38:42.409 --> 38:45.765
CURRENT MISSION CREW

39:16.497 --> 39:18.824
Excuse me Sir,
do you have an appointment?

39:19.885 --> 39:20.998
- Tom.
- Sir.

39:21.480 --> 39:22.781
- Tom.
- Nathaniel... Stop!

39:23.248 --> 39:26.216
What are you doing here?
- I am here to meet him.

39:26.400 --> 39:30.351
- Impossible.
- No, what's impossible...

39:30.528 --> 39:32.720
his shuttling back and forth to Mars.

39:33.102 --> 39:35.114
What's impossible is
building our salvation there.

39:35.306 --> 39:39.088
But I made those things happen,
so you tell me what's impossible

41:12.856 --> 41:14.894
Gardner, Gardner
how are you feeling?

41:15.071 --> 41:16.960
- Water.
- Everything okay?

41:18.399 --> 41:19.646
Water.

41:21.235 --> 41:24.063
- Are you thirsty?
- No, no there is...

41:24.159 --> 41:27.376
- Get this back on.
- There is water everywhere.

41:29.967 --> 41:31.641
I feel so heavy.

41:32.670 --> 41:37.667
But why. Is that normal?
- I believe the term is 'euphoria'.

42:11.176 --> 42:13.471
Sorry about the quarantine.

42:13.628 --> 42:16.733
It's to protect you from us,
not us from you.

42:16.890 --> 42:19.873
Same bubble, different planet.
Nothing has changed. has it?

42:20.034 --> 42:22.241
But Except that.

42:22.360 --> 42:28.054
It is so blue, and green.
There are so many colors.

42:29.791 --> 42:33.061
I'm Nathaniel Shepherd.
How you doing?

42:33.123 --> 42:36.700
I am Fine. I just weigh too much.

42:37.801 --> 42:39.099
I know who you are.

42:42.319 --> 42:43.832
I want to be them.

42:45.103 --> 42:48.291
Well, It's Funny,
because they want to be you.

42:49.677 --> 42:52.409
I got so many questions about Mars.

42:52.572 --> 42:56.106
- Not as many as I have over earth.
- You'd be surprised.

42:56.233 --> 43:00.969
I'll go first.
What is your favourite thing about earth?

43:01.960 --> 43:04.439
Rain. My turn.

43:04.605 --> 43:09.133
What is your favourite thing to do on Mars?
- To Pretend it's earth. My turn.

43:09.306 --> 43:12.404
Did you see my mother die?
- No.

43:16.523 --> 43:17.578
Yes.

43:20.096 --> 43:23.285
Yes. I'm..
I am Sorry.

43:23.424 --> 43:28.125
What scares you?
- You. You're very disarming.

43:28.298 --> 43:31.050
Are you gonna kick me on out of turn?
- Yes.

43:31.177 --> 43:34.424
Can I stay on earth?
- I can't answer that.

43:35.434 --> 43:38.845
Why rain?
- Because it washes everything clean.

43:40.949 --> 43:43.597
- Kendra.
- Hello.

43:44.692 --> 43:47.866
We meet in person.
How you feel?

43:49.187 --> 43:50.241
Heavy.

43:54.206 --> 43:57.523
What's getting me concerned are these
inconsistencies in this last batch.

43:57.619 --> 43:58.621
What about blood?

43:58.803 --> 44:01.328
Blood work is virtually normal,
but if we are going to...

44:01.520 --> 44:04.973
Virtually? Virtually,
Is that what we do around here now?

44:05.131 --> 44:08.561
Virtually, because I like to think.

44:08.666 --> 44:13.176
Meaning Troponin.
Testing for troponin is my point.

44:15.294 --> 44:19.620
Run the test for troponin, please.
- Troponin. Troponin it is.

44:31.327 --> 44:33.760
They need to do more tests.

44:33.933 --> 44:36.927
They already did their tests.
They said I am fine.

44:37.046 --> 44:39.395
I know that.
- I am more than fine.

44:41.092 --> 44:43.859
They are sending me back to Mars,
aren't they? They did not say that.

44:44.035 --> 44:45.552
No they don't have to.

45:08.854 --> 45:10.551
There has been a breach here.

45:10.712 --> 45:11.909
Quarantine.

45:13.068 --> 45:15.970
Word of warning guys,
these are the real deal.

45:16.131 --> 45:18.478
The boots are weighed
for gravity compensation.

45:18.574 --> 45:20.944
As if you're from Mars returning to Earth.

45:21.608 --> 45:24.510
It's going to feel very different.

45:27.484 --> 45:29.895
I don't believe this.
He has turned the pressure.

45:30.236 --> 45:31.657
Raised by scientists.

45:31.941 --> 45:34.029
Lock it down. This is not a drill.

45:37.625 --> 45:38.681
Ah, there he is.

45:42.216 --> 45:46.319
Where does that go?
- Zone H. He has headed to service.

45:46.468 --> 45:48.380
Relax, it's a dead end.

46:33.768 --> 46:36.520
He changed.
Ok, guys, Check the loading dock.

46:38.822 --> 46:40.068
<i><b>DISARMED</b></i>

46:58.295 --> 46:59.350
Thanks.

47:01.020 --> 47:02.533
Alright, Let it go.

47:18.092 --> 47:21.789
I have to talk to you.
Gardner trusts me, he doesn't trust you.

47:21.947 --> 47:23.065
Kendra, give me a minute.

47:23.242 --> 47:25.741
We need teams on the
Washington Avenue Amtrak station...

47:25.932 --> 47:29.822
- the airport and cover the bus stations.
- I'm coming with you.

47:29.945 --> 47:33.845
Kendra. Thank you but I'm good. State
police are helping with blockades.

47:34.007 --> 47:36.351
They will be told he needs
a heart transplant

47:36.446 --> 47:38.368
and the donor suddenly become available.

47:38.560 --> 47:40.500
I promise, I promise I
will keep you updated.

47:40.658 --> 47:42.642
You claim to be concerned
about Gardner's health

47:42.738 --> 47:44.656
but I think you care more
about keeping him secret.

47:48.216 --> 47:49.456
You were saying?

47:50.576 --> 47:54.253
It's one of four ambulances. Come on.

48:50.411 --> 48:52.979
You found Waldo.

48:53.133 --> 48:54.738
I'm Gardner.

48:57.474 --> 49:01.431
This fire..
It is so, so warm.

49:01.527 --> 49:04.341
- I like your shades.
- I like yours.

49:08.205 --> 49:09.818
You wanna trade?

49:13.284 --> 49:17.313
- Do you know where Colorado is?
- Used to.

49:17.486 --> 49:21.228
Greyhound station is about a
3 iron in that direction.

49:21.352 --> 49:24.676
- Golf phrase. You play?
- Used to.

49:32.072 --> 49:34.478
What's your favorite thing about earth?

49:35.415 --> 49:37.822
Dreaming. How about you?

49:38.831 --> 49:41.031
So far?

49:41.165 --> 49:42.271
Meeting you.

49:50.665 --> 49:52.120
Weird kid.

50:19.790 --> 50:21.644
This is so cool.

50:26.464 --> 50:27.520
Open.

50:29.688 --> 50:32.526
Close. Open.

50:45.218 --> 50:48.089
What's your favorite thing about earth?

51:06.287 --> 51:09.231
How do we know for sure
he's going to see her?

51:09.407 --> 51:11.406
Because she's the only person
he knows on earth.

51:12.149 --> 51:13.846
Alright. Read that to me.

51:14.038 --> 51:15.165
There she is.

51:16.362 --> 51:20.865
She was left at the Tulsa Oklahoma child
welfare services when she was 4 years old.

51:21.026 --> 51:24.001
A girl named Tulsa happened
to be abandoned in Tulsa?

51:24.158 --> 51:28.318
It's her nickname. She's lived in five
foster homes over the last twelve years.

51:28.476 --> 51:29.755
She know his story?

51:30.130 --> 51:32.649
He told her he was confined
to a Park Ave penthouse.

51:32.875 --> 51:36.720
And had osteogenesis imperfecta.
Brittle bones.

51:36.897 --> 51:38.563
Put the address in the sidetrack.

51:38.747 --> 51:42.541
We'll land close
but not too close. I don't wanna spook him.

52:09.780 --> 52:11.987
- Hey hello.
- Get away from me... Okay

52:14.992 --> 52:16.048
Gentlemen.

52:43.394 --> 52:44.773
It's me.

52:46.179 --> 52:48.178
It's Gardner.

52:53.382 --> 52:57.006
- What was that for?
- Why did you ghost me like that?

52:57.168 --> 53:00.061
Ghost? You completely shut me off. You
didn't return any of my messages.

53:00.223 --> 53:01.915
I told you I was taking a trip?

53:02.077 --> 53:05.051
For seven months? People have phones
you know. You can text, email...

53:05.227 --> 53:09.326
I couldn't contact you. It was a
very specific type of travel.

53:09.511 --> 53:11.910
Very specific type of travel?
Who even talks like that?

53:12.071 --> 53:14.567
Tulsa. Can you slow down?
This gravity is very heavy.

53:14.720 --> 53:16.292
Oh. I'm sorry but this is heavy for you.

53:16.331 --> 53:19.894
But I really do not appreciate being
blown off by the one person who I...

53:20.086 --> 53:23.778
Tulsa. I would never ghost on you.

53:23.905 --> 53:26.872
Okay. I have actually gone
through quite a lot to get here.

53:27.928 --> 53:29.655
"The only person who what?

53:31.662 --> 53:33.221
Who I don't hate.

53:34.940 --> 53:39.020
- You're taller than I thought you'll be.
- You're meaner than I thought you'll be.

53:40.533 --> 53:43.353
What are you wearing?
This is so weird.

53:43.481 --> 53:46.857
I have a lab, okay.
So... I don't know.

53:47.015 --> 53:51.621
Can you just stay here? Alright.
Do not move, Gardner.

54:12.924 --> 54:16.593
And those were the highlights of the
19th century industrial revolution.

54:16.755 --> 54:20.162
Now. The 20th century had some
of the greatest inventions...

54:20.436 --> 54:22.826
Hello.
- Hello.

54:22.945 --> 54:24.844
And you are?
- Gardner.

54:24.940 --> 54:27.413
Are you a transfer student?
- Okay.

54:28.918 --> 54:30.925
Where are you from Gardner?
- East Texas.

54:31.083 --> 54:34.194
- Don't think I have you on my roster.
- Okay.

54:37.746 --> 54:39.746
Alright folks. Telephone.

54:39.864 --> 54:43.192
- I told you to wait for me.
- I've waited long enough.

54:43.365 --> 54:45.926
One father. Who is he?
- Thomas Edison.

54:46.102 --> 54:50.243
Good. Give me one fact about Thomas Edison.
- Dude was badass.

54:51.245 --> 54:54.154
Edison wasn't a badass.
- Excuse me?

54:54.324 --> 54:56.253
Edison invented direct current, but

54:56.253 --> 54:58.866
it was Nikola Tesla who invented
alternating current.

54:59.058 --> 55:01.854
Edison got jealous and claim
AC electrocuted pets.

55:02.015 --> 55:04.253
To prove it, he
electrocuted an elephant.

55:04.495 --> 55:07.773
That's not badass.
That's a bad person.

55:10.916 --> 55:15.147
You see folks. You learn something
new every day. Thank you er...

55:16.079 --> 55:18.784
Excuse me. That's our
emergency eye wash spray.

55:25.614 --> 55:29.052
So the operation worked.
You're all better now?

55:31.505 --> 55:35.159
- Tell me where are you really from?
- Mars.

55:35.305 --> 55:37.135
You're from Mars?

55:37.846 --> 55:39.926
Alright. Fine. Don't tell me.

55:40.878 --> 55:45.162
Okay. Look at this.
This is my mother.

55:45.258 --> 55:47.426
- She died.
- I'm sorry.

55:47.553 --> 55:51.809
What for? It wasn't your fault.
It was mine. I killed her.

55:51.936 --> 55:55.333
But this is my father. You're
going to help me find him.

55:55.494 --> 55:57.222
I don't know where he is, but...

55:59.471 --> 56:01.524
Well. You have your
father's smile.

56:15.142 --> 56:19.844
I found the house. Route 14,
latitude 40, 34 longitude.

56:31.774 --> 56:33.877
Alright. You stay here.

56:55.725 --> 56:56.780
Gardner.

56:58.788 --> 57:02.384
- Gardner. You need to come with me now.
- No.

57:02.480 --> 57:06.046
We are here to help. You're
putting yourself in great danger.

57:06.207 --> 57:09.597
Why can't you just leave me alone?
This is my life.

57:09.662 --> 57:12.733
Gardner. Gardner. Please. Come on.
- I'm going to find my father.

57:12.894 --> 57:16.584
He's all I have.
- That is not true. You have me.

57:16.680 --> 57:22.247
No. I don't. Kendra. You told me yourself.
You don't want children.

57:22.431 --> 57:24.508
Gardner. That's not what I meant.
You know that.

57:24.508 --> 57:25.577
You never wanted children.

57:25.769 --> 57:28.308
And I'm sorry you had
to raise me at all.

57:49.323 --> 57:51.261
I'll get the van. You go.

58:18.086 --> 58:19.150
Duck.

58:21.968 --> 58:23.023
Sorry.

58:24.494 --> 58:27.498
Alright. You're gonna need to get in.
Hurry. Cmon.

58:29.268 --> 58:31.609
Gardner. Let's go.

58:35.159 --> 58:36.975
Go faster.

58:37.758 --> 58:40.607
I'm trying to help him.

58:40.764 --> 58:42.141
Just jump.

58:43.604 --> 58:45.995
Cmon. Cmon. Get in.

58:46.122 --> 58:48.217
There you go.

58:49.952 --> 58:52.151
Alright, you may wanna hop in.

58:56.085 --> 58:59.141
Gardner, take your seat please.

59:01.267 --> 59:03.709
There you go.

59:07.370 --> 59:08.449
Come on.

59:28.934 --> 59:33.133
- You know how to fly this, right?
- No.

01:00:22.977 --> 01:00:24.032
Oh, no.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:29.064
The pressure.
- I know, right?

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.154
No Gardner the oil pressure.

01:00:39.048 --> 01:00:40.488
Alright. I've got them.

01:00:41.224 --> 01:00:43.350
Looks like they're landing on the free way.

01:00:46.571 --> 01:00:49.218
This will be a bit tricky
I usually have a landing strip.

01:00:54.635 --> 01:00:56.961
Co ordinates, I need co ordinates.

01:01:13.144 --> 01:01:16.456
Brakes, try it.
There is no brakes.

01:01:28.124 --> 01:01:30.539
We are gonna have to jump.
Let's jump

01:01:45.754 --> 01:01:47.324
Oh, no.

01:02:00.707 --> 01:02:02.492
Holy crap.

01:02:03.947 --> 01:02:06.274
Alright we gotta go. Come on.

01:02:42.929 --> 01:02:44.100
No bodies.

01:02:45.292 --> 01:02:46.926
What? Are you sure?

01:02:47.118 --> 01:02:51.838
Positive. They fellas went to the wreckage.
They are alive, somewhere.

01:02:54.901 --> 01:03:00.458
You had one job...
One job to protect Gardner.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.224
To keep him making contact
with the outside world.

01:03:04.377 --> 01:03:07.590
Preventing exactly this
kind of eventuality.

01:03:08.496 --> 01:03:11.532
You hanging this on me?

01:03:17.953 --> 01:03:20.394
I admired you more than anyone.

01:03:22.025 --> 01:03:26.632
We have been shouldering
East Texas for you. For years..

01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:28.094
What are you trying to say?

01:03:28.187 --> 01:03:32.767
I am trying to say the whole mission
was your job, your responsibility.

01:03:32.958 --> 01:03:36.008
You just gave up.
Where were you?

01:03:47.021 --> 01:03:49.995
When is the BMW's gonna ready?
- Later.

01:03:50.141 --> 01:03:53.307
Well, can you get the paperwork started?

01:03:55.419 --> 01:03:58.888
Please... sir?

01:04:00.735 --> 01:04:03.548
This is stealing.
- yeah, what ever.

01:04:03.671 --> 01:04:07.052
It's wrong.
How do you supposed to be find you father?

01:04:12.385 --> 01:04:15.424
When you're right or wrong, seem to change
when you really need something

01:04:23.876 --> 01:04:25.300
Is that a friend of yours?

01:04:51.953 --> 01:04:55.637
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere off the grid.

01:04:55.749 --> 01:04:57.972
Disabling the phone.

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:05.048
So Gardner, when you said
that you killed you mother

01:05:05.165 --> 01:05:06.864
what exactly did you mean by that?

01:05:07.056 --> 01:05:08.999
She died giving birth to me.

01:05:10.265 --> 01:05:12.023
That does not mean that
you have killed her.

01:05:12.261 --> 01:05:15.796
So, Who is that guy?
- He founded East Texas. Where I am from.

01:05:15.957 --> 01:05:17.861
I thought you said you're from New York.

01:05:18.779 --> 01:05:22.322
- Who was the woman?
- Kendra? She's an astronaut.

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:25.111
- Who you are now from, Mars?
- Yeah.

01:05:27.402 --> 01:05:28.361
Get out.

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:32.662
Get out.

01:05:38.116 --> 01:05:41.210
I don't understand.
- I don't want to be played, Gardner.

01:05:41.344 --> 01:05:44.576
That's what it is? Mars?
Some weird disease?

01:05:44.737 --> 01:05:47.727
People have been lying to me
my entire life, which is...

01:05:47.823 --> 01:05:50.201
Whatever cause people suck.
They suck they lie

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:52.947
and they use you to get what they want,
and then they just throw you away

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:55.676
And the thing is
I didn't even like Calculus.

01:05:55.833 --> 01:05:58.689
Now it's just Mr. Halls always drunk
and nobody can understand what he said...

01:05:58.712 --> 01:06:01.000
but he doesn't care
what we do on our computers

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.228
So that's what I look forward to,
to Calculus.

01:06:03.469 --> 01:06:05.974
To talking to you. So get out.

01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:13.789
Tulsa, I am not lying to you. My mother
was an astronaut. She made a mistake.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.092
I was born on Mars.

01:06:16.226 --> 01:06:18.056
Just because people have
lied to you before,

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.543
I doesn't mean that
I am lying now.

01:06:19.688 --> 01:06:22.222
And just because something sounds
crazy to you,

01:06:22.222 --> 01:06:23.411
Doesn't mean that it's not true

01:06:24.782 --> 01:06:27.732
So if you really wanna get rid of me,
You have to get out

01:06:28.005 --> 01:06:29.667
Because I'm gonna find my father

01:06:30.186 --> 01:06:35.655
You know.. When people talk to me
that way, they get their ass kicked.

01:06:35.818 --> 01:06:38.822
Try it. I am rocking this gravity.

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:43.574
Okay, Maybe you actually
believe it yourself.

01:06:46.852 --> 01:06:49.965
- What?
- I am Sorry.

01:06:50.314 --> 01:06:52.758
- For what?
- For people lying

01:06:53.205 --> 01:06:55.302
for people sucking things.

01:06:55.895 --> 01:06:58.912
I'm sorry you're angry.
- I am not angry.

01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:06.588
Allow me?
- What are you doing?

01:07:06.746 --> 01:07:10.131
Chivalry is not dead
at least not in Nantucket.

01:07:20.422 --> 01:07:23.941
On a road trip with an insane.

01:07:24.859 --> 01:07:26.283
What is...

01:07:31.626 --> 01:07:33.280
It's just a horse.

01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:05.324
We should not be doing this.

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:08.662
We need a device that's not being traced.
You wanna know where your father is, right?

01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:14.238
Hey, it's unlocked. Consider
yourself lucky.

01:08:14.238 --> 01:08:15.389
I consider myself a criminal.

01:08:18.163 --> 01:08:21.167
There was a Sarah Elliot
who was an astronaut. Maybe that.

01:08:21.345 --> 01:08:24.479
Says she died tragically from pressure
suit failure shortly after arriving.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.825
Well, I'm a secret.
- Of course you are. And I'm enigma

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:32.232
- Same person.
- I know, it's not working..

01:08:32.389 --> 01:08:35.265
Damn it. We lost connection.
- Yeah, they are pretty cheap here.

01:08:35.426 --> 01:08:40.015
Your best option is to save decoy isn't
piggybacking of the firewall installed.

01:08:42.758 --> 01:08:46.823
Oh, cool, Thanks.
- Pay for my wrap and I won't tell.

01:08:46.935 --> 01:08:49.636
No, we don't have money. Sorry.
- We do have money.

01:08:49.796 --> 01:08:52.571
Why do not you say that louder?
- We have money.

01:08:53.691 --> 01:08:56.438
Sorry, he doesn't speak sarcasm.

01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:58.819
Here, take it.

01:09:00.362 --> 01:09:04.885
My mother was wearing this when she died.
It's some sort of ring.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:08.314
Looks like Half a ring.
Part of a bigger ring?

01:09:08.433 --> 01:09:10.424
There's words on it. Let's see.

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:17.763
In Havasupai, Indian tribe in Arizona.

01:09:17.859 --> 01:09:20.161
"Reunion of the halves. Love, eternity."

01:09:22.182 --> 01:09:25.051
Yep, it's signed. Shaman Neka.

01:09:25.738 --> 01:09:27.895
Gardener I think this is
some kind of wedding ring,

01:09:28.184 --> 01:09:30.649
and he married them.
That's Shaman Neka.

01:09:30.841 --> 01:09:32.801
Alright, How far is it Arizona?

01:09:32.962 --> 01:09:34.017
Smile.

01:09:36.246 --> 01:09:37.372
Oh no.

01:09:39.904 --> 01:09:42.609
Oh, not smiling, running. Come on.
Let's go.

01:09:47.435 --> 01:09:50.377
Two teenagers got here last night.
We think they are still in there.

01:10:00.153 --> 01:10:03.291
Where is he?
- Sir you gotta.

01:10:03.643 --> 01:10:04.852
- Hey.
- We got him.

01:10:10.733 --> 01:10:12.141
Are you okay?

01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:17.876
Talk to me.

01:10:19.402 --> 01:10:20.856
What's going on?

01:10:26.891 --> 01:10:31.145
You're right, Kendra. I gave up.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:37.586
I withdrew. And the greater the pressure,
the emotion why I retreated.

01:10:38.706 --> 01:10:44.276
As long as he was just a face on the
screen, I could almost handle it.

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.510
Sentencing a boy to a life
he never asked for.

01:10:47.633 --> 01:10:51.419
But it's like the malignancy of any secret
It just kept getting worse.

01:10:53.544 --> 01:10:56.933
Every time I go over it,
what I did, the choices I made,

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:58.605
I couldn't have done anything else.

01:10:58.797 --> 01:11:00.825
But that's, that's not the point.

01:11:00.963 --> 01:11:03.737
I dealt with the problem.

01:11:03.856 --> 01:11:06.787
I just had no idea
what the solution would do to me.

01:11:11.183 --> 01:11:16.346
It killed me,
and I say, it's still killing me.

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:18.391
I need to make this right.

01:11:24.851 --> 01:11:27.989
Gardner's blood has
elevated levels ​​of troponin.

01:11:28.166 --> 01:11:30.628
The news is not good Kendra.

01:11:30.724 --> 01:11:32.009
Thank you.

01:11:35.865 --> 01:11:37.764
Talk to me about troponin.

01:11:39.851 --> 01:11:43.648
What?
- Elevated troponin in Gardner.

01:11:44.454 --> 01:11:48.186
He's myosettic. Pool was depleted,
I've read the chart.

01:11:48.348 --> 01:11:50.176
It's not necessarily a
problem on its own but

01:11:50.176 --> 01:11:53.556
in conjunction with
elevated levels of troponin

01:11:54.301 --> 01:11:57.290
He is suffering from an enlarged heart.

01:11:57.401 --> 01:12:01.981
His heart can not
handle our atmosphere, our gravity.

01:12:03.075 --> 01:12:04.904
He is running out of time.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.934
Is that a balloon?

01:12:23.775 --> 01:12:28.017
Tulsa, There is a balloon.
Tulsa, There is a balloon out there.

01:12:28.194 --> 01:12:30.737
- Alright, alright.
- That's huge.

01:12:31.719 --> 01:12:34.406
- Burgers and balloons.
- You really gotta slow down.

01:12:34.406 --> 01:12:35.546
That's your fifth?

01:12:35.738 --> 01:12:37.017
These taste so good.

01:12:37.777 --> 01:12:41.950
Hey, Can you check in there,
see if there is any cash? Here?

01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:45.913
Cowboys always stash away a few box

01:12:49.883 --> 01:12:53.106
No, That's for your mouth.
Just gotta blown it.

01:12:54.241 --> 01:12:58.035
No, you don't... Yeah, okay.

01:13:00.617 --> 01:13:04.261
Nice. There you go.

01:13:06.866 --> 01:13:10.626
You got a..
Marks on your face.

01:13:14.581 --> 01:13:16.065
Thanks.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.245
Alright, go change. Relax,

01:13:39.358 --> 01:13:41.775
this place is like a million stores
and like a trillion dollars.

01:13:41.847 --> 01:13:45.934
Don't, there are cameras. Alright. But
look, this is the last of our money.

01:13:46.091 --> 01:13:49.520
Go buy the clothes then change.

01:14:33.421 --> 01:14:39.272
Break my heart, break my hands

01:14:39.367 --> 01:14:44.546
You can take anything
but my plans.

01:14:47.408 --> 01:14:52.875
I have got big things to do.

01:14:55.598 --> 01:15:01.138
You can laugh, I'll be

01:15:01.234 --> 01:15:05.956
I'll be standing right here when you die

01:15:09.266 --> 01:15:12.527
I got big things...

01:15:16.432 --> 01:15:19.271
Is that your song?
- Maybe.

01:15:19.417 --> 01:15:22.413
It's beautiful.
- Whatever.

01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:33.008
What goes on in there?

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.182
I don't know.

01:15:38.371 --> 01:15:42.442
Got a few sleeping bags. Ready?
Yeah.

01:15:43.032 --> 01:15:47.045
And I am driving this time.
- In your dreams.

01:15:48.123 --> 01:15:49.370
Excuse me, sir.

01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:00.015
Play that again.

01:16:03.947 --> 01:16:08.175
They are moving aimlessly.
Why New Mexico?

01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:29.672
Both hands on the wheel,
both eyes on the road.

01:16:34.245 --> 01:16:36.497
Dude, do you have a problem?

01:16:36.673 --> 01:16:39.243
Cause you've definitely been looking at me
for the last four hours,

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.664
and it's starting to freak me out.

01:16:42.163 --> 01:16:47.748
You are so Beautiful.
And then you work that out just like that?

01:16:47.844 --> 01:16:49.050
Yes, why wouldn't I?

01:16:50.136 --> 01:16:53.646
Because you may wanna
just play it cool, you know.

01:16:53.837 --> 01:16:57.949
Ease yourself into the love game.
- But I do think you're beautiful.

01:16:58.110 --> 01:17:00.369
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

01:17:00.369 --> 01:17:02.204
Okay. Just slow your roll, kid.

01:17:02.396 --> 01:17:06.868
You are.. You gotta calm down.
- But I do not wanna calm down.

01:17:06.964 --> 01:17:09.315
I don't understand why
this is making you so upset.

01:17:09.411 --> 01:17:12.430
First of all, I'm not upset,
I am uncomfortable. There's a difference.

01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:16.067
Secondly, people don't go around saying
what they feel whenever they feel it.

01:17:16.251 --> 01:17:20.087
They have guards and shields
and other metaphors.

01:17:20.245 --> 01:17:24.081
Why? - Because we are all
messed up and scared...

01:17:24.242 --> 01:17:26.407
and try to be something we are not.
And if we all went around

01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:29.271
just declaring our innermost desires
to the exact people we felt them for...

01:17:29.294 --> 01:17:31.715
Then we will all end up
happy, or something.

01:17:36.487 --> 01:17:38.102
Look, Gardner...

01:17:39.364 --> 01:17:42.640
I'm happy that you
think I am beautiful... and

01:17:43.281 --> 01:17:45.219
.. kind of having
an amazing time with you.

01:17:45.364 --> 01:17:47.551
But the last thing I'm gonna do
is actually tell you that.

01:17:48.433 --> 01:17:49.775
You just did.

01:17:52.111 --> 01:17:56.059
- You are blushing.
- I'm not.. not blushing.

01:18:17.127 --> 01:18:18.876
Both hands on the wheel?

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:22.985
No.

01:18:28.616 --> 01:18:31.398
What is happening?
Oh This is...

01:18:31.574 --> 01:18:34.229
I believe the term is 'euphoria'.

01:18:43.777 --> 01:18:45.131
I have an idea.

01:18:56.647 --> 01:18:59.835
Hail in the southern desert
extending form Las

01:19:40.882 --> 01:19:42.601
Close your eyes.

01:20:09.573 --> 01:20:13.275
How did you just become
more beautiful in 20 seconds?

01:20:14.728 --> 01:20:16.516
Do you want to kiss me?

01:20:19.067 --> 01:20:22.431
Yeah, but I don't know how.

01:20:23.632 --> 01:20:24.917
You will.

01:20:45.832 --> 01:20:50.754
You don't understand.
On Mars, the people didn't do this.

01:20:50.923 --> 01:20:55.910
We just had scientists
they studied ground samples.

01:20:56.063 --> 01:20:57.766
Shut up, Gardner.

01:20:58.698 --> 01:21:01.207
I thought about you everyday up there.

01:21:08.795 --> 01:21:11.592
I know what's going to happen.

01:21:11.768 --> 01:21:15.340
I'm gonna fall in love with you
and I'll fall to earth.

01:21:15.497 --> 01:21:18.865
I'll be just like you.
- That a hook line.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:23.300
Ok, I'll shut up now.
- No no.

01:21:24.593 --> 01:21:26.311
Hold that thought.

01:21:30.205 --> 01:21:31.548
To myself?

01:22:21.809 --> 01:22:24.870
All my life I could not feel anything.

01:22:26.013 --> 01:22:29.665
I couldn't feel water,
I couldn't feel fire.

01:22:29.823 --> 01:22:32.684
I could not feel wind on my face.

01:22:33.501 --> 01:22:35.331
And now I can.

01:22:37.295 --> 01:22:40.671
That's nothing compared to
what I feel with you.

01:22:42.612 --> 01:22:47.055
I was so scared
I would not know how to be human.

01:22:50.492 --> 01:22:53.338
You make me human, Tulsa.

01:23:27.607 --> 01:23:29.275
That's incredible.

01:23:30.043 --> 01:23:33.495
I know right?
- It has so many legs.

01:23:36.733 --> 01:23:40.776
Everything's cool?
This is reservation property

01:23:40.937 --> 01:23:43.708
The tourist lookout,
it's 15 miles that way.

01:23:43.886 --> 01:23:44.845
Yeah, we know.

01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:48.579
We're hopefully not intruding,
but we're looking for Shaman Neka.

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:54.134
When you know, you know.

01:23:54.813 --> 01:23:57.567
Know what?
- I am not sure.

01:23:57.728 --> 01:23:59.144
Come on.

01:24:08.838 --> 01:24:10.756
I have married many couples.

01:24:10.917 --> 01:24:15.233
There were no state records.
Do you keep any?

01:24:16.598 --> 01:24:18.221
I would keep her.

01:24:19.748 --> 01:24:23.039
What was her name?
- Sarah Elliott.

01:24:26.381 --> 01:24:30.926
So, I made this ring 16 years ago.

01:24:31.057 --> 01:24:34.018
The other half of the ring
is with your father.

01:24:35.491 --> 01:24:37.160
And this is the chart.

01:24:38.614 --> 01:24:42.189
It doesn't say his name.
- No, she paid. That's her address.

01:24:42.347 --> 01:24:45.673
Do you have that photo?
Mind if I borrow your computer?

01:24:53.441 --> 01:24:56.782
Summerland, California.

01:25:09.457 --> 01:25:13.013
I think this is it.

01:25:13.159 --> 01:25:14.597
We found it.

01:25:16.504 --> 01:25:17.942
Let's go.

01:25:49.295 --> 01:25:52.564
You look like crap. You okay?

01:25:56.530 --> 01:25:59.519
Do you know where we are going?
- Oh yeah.

01:26:00.581 --> 01:26:03.961
Paris, Venice and Cairo.

01:26:15.807 --> 01:26:19.240
Hello, Checking in?
Hi we just left the key is in the ignition.

01:26:19.336 --> 01:26:20.480
Checking in.
Thank you.

01:26:20.672 --> 01:26:21.631
You're welcome.

01:26:22.559 --> 01:26:26.026
Well, you wanted to see the world.
Here you have it.

01:26:26.211 --> 01:26:30.534
It's..
It's like a big toy.

01:26:31.232 --> 01:26:35.241
No, no no look.
That's Paris, New York, Shanghai.

01:26:35.417 --> 01:26:40.374
And look, over there, Venice.
- Feels weird.

01:26:40.543 --> 01:26:43.891
I mean... It's
It's not real.

01:26:44.049 --> 01:26:49.565
It's not how I.. how I pictured it.
Hurting my heads to see it like this.

01:26:49.707 --> 01:26:54.648
I'm sorry Gardner, but the world doesn't
always give you exactly what you want.

01:26:55.128 --> 01:26:59.650
It gave to you.
Alright, let me be cynical for one second.

01:27:08.968 --> 01:27:13.380
Tulsa just because your parents are gone,
that does not mean you can't have a family.

01:27:13.564 --> 01:27:19.157
We can be each other's family, because this
This isn't..

01:27:19.318 --> 01:27:21.812
This is not real
but we can be real.

01:27:24.033 --> 01:27:26.186
I think it's time to go.
Let's ski into California.

01:27:26.306 --> 01:27:27.596
Did you hear me what I said?

01:27:27.973 --> 01:27:30.850
Oh yeah, I did.
Gardner I think you are sick.

01:27:31.026 --> 01:27:33.831
None of this is how it was in my head.
- You need to go to the hospital.

01:27:34.007 --> 01:27:35.995
- Except you.
- You need to go to the hospital.

01:27:36.091 --> 01:27:38.447
Something is wrong with you.
Gardner, Gardner...

01:27:40.778 --> 01:27:43.885
You are okay, you're okay.
Please help.

01:27:47.234 --> 01:27:49.912
I wanna scan him.

01:27:52.751 --> 01:27:55.555
- What's his name?
- Gardner.

01:27:55.681 --> 01:27:59.702
- What's his Last name?
- I don't know.

01:27:59.901 --> 01:28:01.662
Where is he from?

01:28:04.178 --> 01:28:05.544
I don't know.

01:28:16.719 --> 01:28:17.760
Look at this.

01:28:18.434 --> 01:28:21.843
- I've never seen it like it before.
- Oh My God. What is that?

01:28:24.157 --> 01:28:26.445
His heart is grossly enlarged.

01:28:27.961 --> 01:28:29.512
I gave him some valsartan, but...

01:28:31.112 --> 01:28:32.915
Doesn't look good.

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:36.092
He was not lying.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.665
Gardner

01:28:41.332 --> 01:28:43.162
Gardner, I have to go.

01:28:44.688 --> 01:28:46.745
Social Services are coming.

01:28:48.429 --> 01:28:50.420
But I'm gonna go to Summerland.

01:28:51.969 --> 01:28:57.286
I'll find your father
and tell him how amazing you are.

01:28:57.444 --> 01:29:02.431
How much you think about him
and how badly you wanted to go there.

01:29:04.797 --> 01:29:06.332
I promise.

01:29:16.106 --> 01:29:19.294
We need to go.
- You can't you can't.

01:29:20.238 --> 01:29:22.060
You have to stay here, Gardner

01:29:27.615 --> 01:29:29.733
Do you even know why you're sick?

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:33.922
Because your heart's too big.

01:29:34.079 --> 01:29:36.918
We have to go into Summerland.
- You can't. They are gonna help you.

01:29:37.075 --> 01:29:42.054
There is nothing they can do.
They can't. Don't you see?

01:29:42.576 --> 01:29:47.371
No matter how much I want earth,
the earth does not want me.

01:29:58.519 --> 01:30:00.621
Wait a second. Get my bag.

01:30:05.290 --> 01:30:06.886
Hang on.

01:30:27.348 --> 01:30:29.953
Social service.
- Thank God.

01:30:41.956 --> 01:30:45.105
They used a credit card left in the car.

01:30:45.247 --> 01:30:49.045
They are heading north to California.
I know where they're going.

01:30:49.229 --> 01:30:50.284
Good evening.

01:31:05.134 --> 01:31:07.083
I'm not dead.

01:31:10.271 --> 01:31:11.666
You scared me.

01:31:13.359 --> 01:31:15.881
You act like you hate
the world so much, Tulsa.

01:31:18.016 --> 01:31:21.917
- Save your strength.
- It's all an act.

01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:26.206
The beautiful music you
make, gets you away.

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.472
Gardner. We are here.

01:32:09.363 --> 01:32:10.962
Hey, We are here.

01:32:13.226 --> 01:32:19.223
Can you help me?
- Yeah, Of course. Help you what?

01:32:19.319 --> 01:32:20.994
Just to look better.

01:32:52.761 --> 01:32:55.567
This is the best place I've been so far.

01:33:00.343 --> 01:33:01.614
You ready?

01:33:09.276 --> 01:33:10.980
He's gonna love it.

01:34:01.714 --> 01:34:03.077
Can I help you?

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:07.338
Now would be a good time to say something.

01:34:22.217 --> 01:34:24.615
Where did you get this photo?

01:34:24.711 --> 01:34:27.607
East Texas.
- That is impossible.

01:34:27.710 --> 01:34:30.728
My mother was Sarah Elliot.
She died giving birth to me.

01:34:30.885 --> 01:34:34.471
Sarah Elliot died from
pressure suit failure

01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:37.189
That's not. That's what they said, but...

01:34:42.911 --> 01:34:44.485
You're my father.

01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:49.025
- Is this some kind of scam?
- No no, he's not lying.

01:34:49.025 --> 01:34:50.109
It's the truth. I swear.

01:34:50.301 --> 01:34:53.418
I just wanted to meet you.
- Why are you doing this to me?

01:34:53.573 --> 01:34:57.619
I'm not your father. I'm calling the
police. Ok, just stay right here.

01:34:58.226 --> 01:35:00.146
Stop being a dick.

01:35:00.322 --> 01:35:03.362
He risked his life to leave the one place
he has ever know. All alone.

01:35:03.521 --> 01:35:05.909
He didn't know anybody,
never set foot on this planet.

01:35:06.005 --> 01:35:07.366
What do you want from me?

01:35:07.558 --> 01:35:10.158
I could never do it. Just to meet you.

01:35:10.335 --> 01:35:12.105
And he is dying.

01:35:12.289 --> 01:35:14.821
I do not know who you are
or why you are doing this

01:35:14.917 --> 01:35:16.462
I'm not his father.

01:35:16.654 --> 01:35:19.483
Well then who are you? Because that is
you in the photo, and that is this house.

01:35:19.506 --> 01:35:23.031
Yes, this is the house
our parents left it to us.

01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:27.839
Sarah Elliot was my sister.

01:35:30.903 --> 01:35:33.045
We gotta get some help,
please get some help.

01:35:33.286 --> 01:35:34.245
Gardner

01:35:36.210 --> 01:35:37.383
Gardner

01:35:38.692 --> 01:35:39.767
Gardner

01:35:43.562 --> 01:35:44.647
Gardner..

01:35:46.164 --> 01:35:47.621
No, he's not your father.

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:50.299
He's not your father.
He's your uncle.

01:35:50.491 --> 01:35:54.496
That does not matter anymore.
There is no time left Tulsa.

01:35:54.618 --> 01:35:57.067
Let's just go back.
He's gonna call the ambulance.

01:35:57.163 --> 01:35:58.874
My mother is here.

01:36:00.434 --> 01:36:02.042
I can, I can feel her.

01:36:03.238 --> 01:36:06.693
I didn't get to choose where I was born...

01:36:07.815 --> 01:36:09.776
but I get to choose where I die.

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:22.085
- Tulsa.
- Yes, Gardner?

01:36:24.573 --> 01:36:27.204
What's your favourite thing about earth?

01:36:28.436 --> 01:36:30.091
You are, Gardner.

01:36:46.288 --> 01:36:48.335
See you in the funny papers.

01:37:09.294 --> 01:37:11.144
I WAS HERE

01:37:17.242 --> 01:37:20.379
Gardner.

01:37:24.426 --> 01:37:27.849
Kendra. Help me.

01:37:40.689 --> 01:37:42.336
Turn him off.

01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:47.991
Gardner. You can do it.

01:37:49.319 --> 01:37:50.499
Gardner,

01:37:50.595 --> 01:37:55.140
Gardner, Stay with me. Don't leave us.
Come on, come on.

01:37:59.774 --> 01:38:01.230
What was she like?

01:38:04.574 --> 01:38:05.822
My mother.

01:38:12.018 --> 01:38:13.072
She was fearless

01:38:14.584 --> 01:38:16.037
She was kind

01:38:17.489 --> 01:38:21.467
And she just...
seemed so invincible.

01:38:25.072 --> 01:38:28.385
And she'd make me wanna give up
living when she died.

01:38:31.576 --> 01:38:33.192
You loved her.

01:38:38.168 --> 01:38:39.911
You're my father.

01:38:40.909 --> 01:38:41.965
Yes.

01:38:45.148 --> 01:38:49.149
There they are.
- Hurry up. Hurry, there is no time.

01:38:51.326 --> 01:38:55.227
- I knew I would find you.
- You are gonna be okay.

01:38:55.349 --> 01:38:59.204
You are not alone.
Stay with me Gardner.

01:38:59.930 --> 01:39:01.450
Hurry!

01:39:36.757 --> 01:39:38.715
It's taking too long.

01:39:38.876 --> 01:39:42.259
His blood pressure is dropping.
We have to get him out of our gravity.

01:39:45.358 --> 01:39:49.177
You have to take the plane higher.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:39:49.339 --> 01:39:52.690
You know I can't do that.
That's against our regulations.

01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:57.616
I'm taking control.

01:40:00.392 --> 01:40:03.536
What are you doing?
- Taking us into the stratosphere.

01:40:03.713 --> 01:40:08.889
Excuse me?
- No worries. She can handle it.

01:40:09.031 --> 01:40:12.248
Although I warn you,
one of you might need to take over.

01:40:12.405 --> 01:40:15.320
One of us might...
- Yes, there's a chance that I may die.

01:40:15.439 --> 01:40:18.814
But you have done this before?
- Yes all the time.

01:40:19.471 --> 01:40:21.694
Virtually.
- Great.

01:40:21.855 --> 01:40:23.214
Buckle up.

01:40:24.027 --> 01:40:28.492
Alright let's buckle you in.
Yeah, just give it. Grab your thing.

01:40:28.654 --> 01:40:30.286
I have the aircraft.

01:40:55.384 --> 01:40:57.134
No, we gotta go higher.

01:41:50.774 --> 01:41:52.238
Try and wake him up.

01:41:53.016 --> 01:41:55.520
Gardner, wake up.

01:41:58.775 --> 01:42:01.030
No, no.
No, no, no, no!

01:42:01.191 --> 01:42:03.532
Stay in, stay in. I've got him.

01:42:31.073 --> 01:42:34.366
You are on my planet?
- No.

01:42:34.521 --> 01:42:36.344
Where are you, on yours?

01:42:38.007 --> 01:42:39.062
No.

01:42:41.777 --> 01:42:44.464
Will you ever gonna stop slapping me?

01:42:56.043 --> 01:42:58.254
You have to go back.
- No, Tulsa, don't...

01:42:58.350 --> 01:43:00.325
I hate it.

01:43:01.469 --> 01:43:06.828
Look Gardner, we both know..
You have to go back.

01:43:08.211 --> 01:43:10.034
I love you, Tulsa.

01:43:11.187 --> 01:43:12.972
And I love you.

01:43:32.805 --> 01:43:36.157
How is he doing?
- Stable, for now.

01:43:36.318 --> 01:43:40.734
This will buy us the time we need.
- And you? You okay?

01:43:42.078 --> 01:43:43.629
Apparently.

01:43:44.877 --> 01:43:46.471
This is good to know.

01:44:16.713 --> 01:44:21.447
I am gonna miss you Gardner.
More than anything else in the world.

01:44:25.351 --> 01:44:26.599
Me too.

01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:30.484
You're the best mom I never had.

01:44:33.349 --> 01:44:35.238
Safe travels ok?

01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:46.161
Wait a minute, hold up
- Hey.

01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:52.603
Nice ride.

01:44:54.784 --> 01:44:56.451
You gonna be okay?

01:45:00.666 --> 01:45:02.182
You're amazing.

01:45:03.584 --> 01:45:05.791
But the last thing I'm gonna gonna do is

01:45:08.744 --> 01:45:11.704
actually tell you that.

01:45:13.839 --> 01:45:15.517
You just did.

01:45:26.429 --> 01:45:30.763
T minus ten, nine, eight...

01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:36.384
seven, six, five, four...

01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:41.786
three, two, one, zero.

01:45:41.962 --> 01:45:45.107
Ignition. Let's go.

01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:16.291
Same time tomorrow?

01:46:16.932 --> 01:46:18.429
Marks for me.

01:46:22.003 --> 01:46:23.436
Tulsa, you have a visitor.

01:46:26.434 --> 01:46:27.532
Hi.

01:46:27.689 --> 01:46:28.864
Gotta go.

01:46:41.104 --> 01:46:43.607
As you probably know,
I have retired from NASA.

01:46:43.703 --> 01:46:47.535
Well, not really. I am running their
training program now.

01:46:47.689 --> 01:46:49.278
And it's been great.

01:46:49.424 --> 01:46:53.014
I mean getting re accustomed to living
on this planet has been a little trying.

01:46:54.238 --> 01:46:56.772
Anyway, I am getting off track.

01:46:56.942 --> 01:47:00.980
Since I could not spend any money on Mars,
and I was up there for six years...

01:47:01.142 --> 01:47:02.851
It turns out I actually have a lot of it.

01:47:03.029 --> 01:47:07.085
So I bought a ranch house
in Boulder, Colorado.

01:47:07.661 --> 01:47:10.364
I like to ski and
the people are really nice.

01:47:11.443 --> 01:47:15.482
Yeah it's a pretty big house.
Gets lonely at times.

01:47:16.388 --> 01:47:18.250
Would you like to come live with me there?

01:47:23.338 --> 01:47:27.119
Are you getting paid? To take me?

01:47:27.752 --> 01:47:30.557
Oh, God, no.

01:47:30.742 --> 01:47:33.335
Because I age out in a month.

01:47:34.545 --> 01:47:36.553
Who said anything about only a month?

01:47:58.179 --> 01:48:00.284
I wanted to go to Earth.

01:48:01.597 --> 01:48:04.499
Not just to visit, but to live there.

01:48:05.586 --> 01:48:10.819
Turns out people from Earth wanted
exactly the same thing as people from Mars.

01:48:12.105 --> 01:48:17.120
And I should know, because I'm pretty sure
I'm the only one. So far.

01:48:19.369 --> 01:48:22.982
I don't know, which is better
But here is what I do know

01:48:24.230 --> 01:48:25.792
It's good to be home.
