00:50.425 --> 00:52.677
Get out of that van
and run home.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.637
- But do you know
how to pick...

00:54.679 --> 00:58.350
- Babe, this place is--
it's nuts, okay?

00:58.391 --> 01:00.643
Check--check the numbers again.
Can you check 'em?

01:00.685 --> 01:03.188
Just check 'em one more time.
- [sighs]

01:03.229 --> 01:06.024
- Did they go up?
Please tell me they went up.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.402
- [groans]
Still at 113.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.363
- I can't believe
I sold my soul

01:11.404 --> 01:13.365
for 113 downloads.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.200
I mean,
that's a fuckin' disaster.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.993
- Okay, listen,
we're not giving up.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.411
That's why we're here,
all right?

01:18.453 --> 01:20.330
Thousands of crime freaks
just like me

01:20.372 --> 01:21.790
all under one roof?

01:21.831 --> 01:23.124
We're gonna crack this code.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.752
We're gonna figure
this shit out.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.922
We're gonna find out
what these bitches know

01:28.963 --> 01:30.590
that we don't.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.510
[giggles]
- But why did we invite Matt?

01:33.551 --> 01:35.970
- We had to.
We had no choice.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.014
[indistinct chatter]

01:38.056 --> 01:39.432
- It's crowded, right?

01:39.474 --> 01:40.600
There's more people here

01:40.642 --> 01:42.686
than listened to our podcast.
- I know.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.437
Look, this is our meal ticket,
okay?

01:44.479 --> 01:46.147
We gotta listen.
We gotta take notes.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.775
We're gonna figure out
why we're--

01:48.817 --> 01:50.944
what are you doing?
Why are you looking at that?

01:50.985 --> 01:52.529
- Why does Ruby feel the need

01:52.570 --> 01:55.115
to post her workouts
every single day?

01:55.156 --> 01:57.617
- Uh, because her body
looks like that.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.828
I would do the same.
I'd show the entire world.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.287
I used to do that.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.789
["The Final Countdown"

"Sisters in Crime."

02:15.427 --> 02:18.847
- Hello! Hello!
- Hello!

02:18.888 --> 02:21.891
- Hello, Vegas!
[cheers and applause]

02:21.933 --> 02:26.438
So who's ready to talk...
both: Murder?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.275
- Guys, we are so excited

02:30.316 --> 02:33.153
to have our first live podcast

02:33.194 --> 02:34.988
on the Westside Ripper.

02:35.030 --> 02:37.157
- Whoo! Let 'er rip!

02:37.198 --> 02:39.784
[applause]
- Whoo!

02:39.826 --> 02:42.037
So let's get into it.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.872
- But first,

02:43.913 --> 02:46.916
please welcome
the mother of Chloe Lake,

02:46.958 --> 02:50.170
the last victim
of the Westside Ripper,

02:50.211 --> 02:52.172
Melissa Lake.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.966
[scattered applause]

02:59.637 --> 03:02.766
- Thank you so much
for joining us today.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.685
- You know, our one goal here
is to find

03:05.727 --> 03:08.021
the monster
that killed your daughter.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.190
- That's right.
- So...

03:10.231 --> 03:12.484
- While finding Chloe's killer
won't bring her back,

03:12.525 --> 03:14.944
I do think it will help
bring some closure.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.696
- Hey.
- I sure hope so.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.991
- All right. All right.
What'd I miss?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.830
Hey, did you see
all the weirdos out there?

03:25.872 --> 03:27.749
- Shh.
- Sorry.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.835
It is, like, a fucking
murder industry, right?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.671
- I know. That's what I said.
I told you.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.715
- Now, Roch,
we have another surprise guest

03:35.757 --> 03:37.967
who's here to talk to us
for the very first time.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.553
- The only woman to survive

03:40.595 --> 03:42.722
an attack
by the Westside Ripper.

03:42.764 --> 03:47.227
[applause]
- Please welcome Dahlia Stone.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.604
Wow.
- A survivor?

03:49.646 --> 03:51.272
- Wow, look...
- Did you know about this?

03:51.314 --> 03:52.565
- Of course I knew about her.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.067
I just didn't think
she would be here.

03:54.109 --> 03:57.070
[tense music]

03:57.112 --> 03:59.072
* *

03:59.114 --> 04:00.949
audience: Aww.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.452
- Now, Dahlia, it's been
a little over a year

04:04.494 --> 04:07.330
since you escaped
the Westside Ripper.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.873
How are you doing?

04:08.915 --> 04:11.167
- It's been a--
it's been a journey for sure.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.419
- I can only imagine.
- Mm.

04:12.460 --> 04:17.048
- You talk about the PTSD,

04:17.090 --> 04:20.552
the breakdown, the rehab.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.345
Did you have any worries

04:22.387 --> 04:25.223
about putting
all that out there?

04:25.265 --> 04:26.766
- So brave.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.935
- Um...

04:28.977 --> 04:32.772
I mean, I have zero shame
about what happened to me.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.316
Um, I mean,
the animal who attacked me

04:35.358 --> 04:36.401
should have the shame.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.571
[applause]

04:41.740 --> 04:43.908
- Let's get into the attack.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.786
It was brutal.
- Literally, chills.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.998
- Yeah, I was--
I was in the kitchen.

04:50.040 --> 04:54.377
And I saw a reflection
in the window...

04:54.419 --> 04:56.671
um...

04:56.713 --> 05:00.008
of someone coming up behind me
raising a knife in his hand,

05:00.050 --> 05:04.137
and...I mean,
I just had a split second

05:04.179 --> 05:05.555
before he lowered that knife.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.433
And I looked him in the eyes
and I thought...

05:10.352 --> 05:12.145
"Not today."
[applause]

05:12.187 --> 05:13.605
- This is bullshit.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.149
- Yeah, which is the title
of my new book,

05:16.191 --> 05:17.484
um, "Not Today,"

05:17.525 --> 05:20.820
which I'm signing
at 7:30 today.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.614
- This is bullshit.
- Okay. Shh.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.157
- "Not Today."
- How about later?

05:24.199 --> 05:25.325
- Do you know what that's from?

05:25.367 --> 05:27.369
"Game of Thrones,"
season eight.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.954
- And can you please tell us

05:29.996 --> 05:31.414
what you did next?

05:31.456 --> 05:32.665
- [sighs]

05:32.707 --> 05:35.585
I mean, I did
the only thing I could.

05:35.627 --> 05:39.714
I mean, I kicked him so hard
in the fucking balls...

05:41.800 --> 05:44.010
He squealed like a little baby
and ran off.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.512
[applause]

05:45.553 --> 05:47.847
- Yes, queen!
- Whoo!

05:47.889 --> 05:51.101
Kicked him so hard!
- Yes!

05:51.142 --> 05:53.436
- And I'm gonna ask you
what we all wanna know.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.106
- Yep.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.774
- Did you see his face?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.236
- When someone attacks you
like that,

06:01.277 --> 06:03.697
you don't forget his face.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.866
[suspenseful music]

06:06.908 --> 06:10.829
* *

06:10.870 --> 06:12.914
I'd recognize him
in an instant.

06:12.956 --> 06:16.126
[audience gasping]

06:16.167 --> 06:17.794
- [mouthing words]

06:19.546 --> 06:20.714
- It's fucking bullshit.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.215
I've never seen her before
in my life.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.675
- Oh, really, or you just mad

06:23.717 --> 06:25.593
she kicked you in the balls
and then escaped?

06:25.635 --> 06:26.845
- Do I look
like the kind of person

06:26.886 --> 06:28.138
that leaves mistakes behind?

06:28.179 --> 06:29.389
- No. No.
- Do I?

06:29.431 --> 06:31.099
both: No.
- She's a nobody

06:31.141 --> 06:32.392
riding on my coattails.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.145
- Okay, listen,
we said no one else gets hurt.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.480
- Why would I hurt her?
- Keep it down.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.524
- Look, she has no idea
who I am.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.609
All we need to worry about
is our brand.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.028
- Our brand?

06:43.069 --> 06:45.280
- Mysterious serial killer
who leaves no witnesses,

06:45.321 --> 06:48.116
not serial killer who gets
kicked in his fucking balls

06:48.158 --> 06:49.242
and runs away.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.702
We need to expose her,

06:50.744 --> 06:53.079
discredit that fucking book,

06:53.121 --> 06:55.957
or our brand, it's dead.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.917
- Okay, but...

07:06.259 --> 07:09.471
- * Like you always did
with me before *

07:09.512 --> 07:10.805
- This is way too much.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.432
I have a knot in my stomach.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.808
I believe every word
that she said,

07:13.850 --> 07:16.061
and I think he got sloppy.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.646
- [sighs] Maybe the Kubrick
of serial killers

07:18.688 --> 07:20.231
isn't as perfect as he thinks.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.233
- Yeah, exactly.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.651
[grunts]

07:25.987 --> 07:27.447
[both sigh]

07:27.489 --> 07:29.991
[sniffles]

07:30.033 --> 07:32.660
- We used to love Vegas.
- I know.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.912
Every time we came,
it was like,

07:33.953 --> 07:36.039
sex, buffet, sex, buffet,
sex, buffet.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.041
- We had sex everywhere.
- I know.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.794
We had sex, remember,
on that plane ride here.

07:40.835 --> 07:41.836
- Back of the limo?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.797
- Or the spa at the Luxor?

07:43.838 --> 07:45.048
- Oh.
- We were all oiled up.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.299
- Yeah.
- How about at the bathroom

07:46.341 --> 07:47.634
after Penn and Teller?

07:47.676 --> 07:49.886
- That was weird.
- I found a card in my ass.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.388
- [chuckles]
Those guys are great.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.473
- They are so good.
- Ace of spades.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.725
- Pulled it right out.
[both laugh]

07:55.767 --> 07:56.976
- MGM?
- Oh, yeah, on...

07:57.018 --> 07:59.229
both: The roof.
- Yeah.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.816
Oh, it was just, like,
all sparkly and beautiful.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.651
I loved that.
- It was beautiful.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.444
- God, those were
really the good days.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.197
[soft music]

08:09.239 --> 08:11.199
- We could do it again.
- What? Us?

08:11.241 --> 08:12.867
No. Come on.
We're too married for that.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.202
[laughs]

08:16.538 --> 08:18.581
- The High Roller is available.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.959
- The what? The Ferris wheel?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.586
- Yeah, Michael and Vanessa
did it there.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.713
- They fucked
on the Ferris wheel?

08:24.754 --> 08:26.006
- Yeah.
So did Brandon and Nicky.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.173
- Really?

08:27.215 --> 08:28.466
Oh, we are so doing that.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.343
- Well, that deserves
a cocktail.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.637
- [laughs]
Aww.

08:32.679 --> 08:39.686
* *

08:39.728 --> 08:42.605
- I love you.
- I love you too.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.905
[sighs]
- Hey.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.410
Look at this shit.
- What?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.287
- This "survivor,"

08:57.328 --> 09:00.874
she's charging $100
to sign her fake-ass book.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.709
100 bucks on my name

09:02.751 --> 09:06.004
to raise money
for some trauma therapy?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.590
Ooh. May I?
- Yeah.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.258
- You know what?
[sighs]

09:10.300 --> 09:12.761
She is just a scam artist

09:12.802 --> 09:15.221
taking advantage
of the true crime community.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.931
- Yeah, well,
unless she's telling the truth.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.351
Then she does deserve
every penny she's making.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.394
- You know what? You're right.
She would, yeah.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.605
But she didn't get attacked.
- Okay, you know what?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.732
She has a lot of evidence
in this book.

09:25.774 --> 09:26.983
- Yeah, and that's exactly...
- Police report--

09:27.025 --> 09:28.234
- What I'd do
if I wanted to fake an attack

09:28.276 --> 09:31.196
and Smollett myself
into a fortune.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.406
- [sighs]
- Would you do my back?

09:33.448 --> 09:35.325
- Absolutely fucking not.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.661
- Holy shit.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.580
both: Hi!

09:40.622 --> 09:42.457
- Hi, girlfriend!

09:42.499 --> 09:44.167
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.335
- Hi.
- Why didn't you tell me

09:45.377 --> 09:46.544
you were here?

09:46.586 --> 09:47.504
- I'm s--
- You knew we were coming.

09:47.545 --> 09:48.922
- I know. Sorry. I forgot.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.799
- Say hi to Carlos.
Hi, baby.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.592
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, you brought Carlos.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.803
- Where's Nate?
- Hey, I'm Matt.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.848
- Hi, Matt.
- Oh.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.184
- It is so nice to meet you,
Matt.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.228
- Oh, no.
Oh, my God, no, no.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.521
He's our--
he's a friend of ours.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.689
- No, go crazy.
You're in Vegas.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.898
- Oh, my God, no.

10:06.940 --> 10:07.941
This is actually
our friend Matt.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.067
We're, um...
- Oh.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.110
- He's our...
- Friend.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.778
- Funny enough,
he's our plumber.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.697
- Really?
He's your--your plumber?

10:13.738 --> 10:14.948
You got a pizza guy too?

10:14.989 --> 10:16.866
- It's really not like that
at all.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.285
Think you have the wrong idea
of what's actually--

10:19.327 --> 10:22.288
- Holy shit,
it's the three of you?

10:22.330 --> 10:23.915
- Uh...
- Ruby.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.625
- Nathan!
- Hi.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.627
- Hi! Oh, my goodness.

10:27.669 --> 10:28.962
- Oh, I didn't know
you'd be here.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.338
- I didn't know
you'd be here either.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.299
So good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.677
Um, here, babe.
- All right, thanks.

10:35.719 --> 10:36.845
- Did you, uh--
- Oh, is this for me?

10:36.886 --> 10:37.804
- Did you meet Matt?
- Thank you so much.

10:37.846 --> 10:38.763
- Everyone met.
- Oh, yeah.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.265
We're old friends, right?

10:40.306 --> 10:41.850
She thought we were having
a three-way.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.477
- I did. I do.
- What? She's pregnant.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.645
- Yeah?
- Really?

10:45.687 --> 10:46.813
That's the reason
why we're not?

10:46.855 --> 10:49.399
Otherwise we'd all be fucking?

10:49.441 --> 10:52.569
- Did you guys catch
the new "Sisters in Crime"?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.696
- Of course. Yes.
- Oh, my God.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.072
Westside Ripper
is totally screwed.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.449
I mean, he let that girl
get away.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.950
Like, what an idiot, right?

10:58.992 --> 11:01.161
She is totally gonna
get his ass, I'm telling you.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.580
- You know,
I wouldn't be so sure.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.914
- Uh, uh...
[clears throat]

11:04.956 --> 11:07.959
Ruby, I saw
your Insta story this morning.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.337
You're lookin' fit.
- You saw my what?

11:10.378 --> 11:11.713
- Your Instagram.

11:11.755 --> 11:12.797
Yeah, you're hittin'
the gym hard.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.300
You look great.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.761
- That's weird. Creeper.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.221
Um, anyways...
- What?

11:20.263 --> 11:21.848
- She was saying that
she grabbed him by the balls

11:21.890 --> 11:23.683
and then he squealed.
- I know.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.894
[sighs]

11:25.935 --> 11:28.229
Cannot believe I forgot
she was gonna be here.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.773
- And why's she goin' off
on me?

11:29.814 --> 11:32.484
I mean, she puts her workouts
on Instagram for one reason,

11:32.525 --> 11:35.320
so the entire world can see
how great she looks, right?

11:35.362 --> 11:38.114
It's totally deliberate.
So I saw it, as intended.

11:38.156 --> 11:41.368
I make one innocent comment,
and now I'm the creeper? Me?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.827
- Okay, you don't talk
about shit

11:42.869 --> 11:44.371
people post on Instagram.
Everyone knows that.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.164
- But that's
why she puts it up.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.624
- Babe, you don't make
your friends

11:47.665 --> 11:48.792
talk about their fake lives.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.335
It's awkward.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.839
- You think Simon knows
they're here?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.049
- [sighs]
He's probably watching them

11:56.091 --> 11:57.550
fuck on his iPhone.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.052
[water running]

12:01.262 --> 12:05.308
- Would you tell me
if you were having an affair?

12:05.350 --> 12:07.018
- Of course I would.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.729
Especially if you found out,
I would tell you 100%.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.731
- Nice.
- [groans]

12:11.773 --> 12:13.274
Listen, I know--
I know you're stressed

12:13.316 --> 12:15.110
and you feel like you sold
your soul for this whole thing

12:15.151 --> 12:16.903
and you're freaking out,
but guess what.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.155
I'm freaking out too.
All right?

12:19.197 --> 12:20.699
Can we please
just stick together here

12:20.740 --> 12:22.992
and keep our eyes on the prize?

12:23.034 --> 12:24.953
- Really?
'Cause Ruby thinks we're having

12:24.994 --> 12:26.913
a three-way
with the Westside Ripper.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.915
Tell me,
how's that gonna play out?

12:32.460 --> 12:34.921
- [sighs]

12:40.927 --> 12:42.262
Whatever.
- Okay.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.014
- Well, I mean, I don't know.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.890
He was our plumber
and now he's our friend.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.642
Is that really so weird?

12:47.684 --> 12:49.644
- But you guys travel together,

12:49.686 --> 12:50.854
like, the three of you?

12:50.895 --> 12:52.105
- No. He--
- [giggles]

12:52.147 --> 12:53.940
- He wanted
to come to CrimeCon like us.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.066
- Oh.
- What's wrong with that?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.694
- No, it's cool.
I mean, go crazy.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.446
Wait, Carlos and I,
we do this thing

12:59.487 --> 13:03.241
where my car just broke down
and he works for AAA.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.118
And, oh, I just--I forgot...
- Okay.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.619
- My wallet today and--
- Stop talking. We're good.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.705
I'm done with your story now.
- I'll see you at dinner.

13:08.747 --> 13:11.041
- Bye.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.168
- [exhales heavily]

13:20.675 --> 13:22.010
Hey.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.387
- Hey. How are you?

13:24.429 --> 13:26.389
- Good.
Uh, you're into true crime?

13:26.431 --> 13:29.142
I had no idea.
- Yes. Big time.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.353
- Yeah.
- You're a Zodiac guy?

13:31.394 --> 13:33.146
- Oh, right.
Uh, who isn't?

13:33.188 --> 13:34.981
- Wow.
Do you think it was Gary Poste?

13:35.023 --> 13:36.441
- I don't know,
my money used to be

13:36.483 --> 13:37.567
on Arthur Leigh Allen,

13:37.609 --> 13:39.527
but lately I have
this little soft spot

13:39.569 --> 13:40.987
for Richard Gaikowski.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.989
- Gaikowski, yes.
No one talks about him, right?

13:43.031 --> 13:44.741
- The cipher, right?
For sure it's him.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.034
It's gotta be him.
- Absolutely.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.827
- Yeah.
We just solved the Zodiac case.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.079
Richard Gaikowski.
What do you know?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.413
- We make a very good team.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.498
- Killer team.
- That was very fast.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.249
- That was very fast.
- [laughs]

they're actually doing
