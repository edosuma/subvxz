00:06.048 --> 00:08.132
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:08.258 --> 00:10.135
I wanna know
who this man is.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.471
OK, Martin, what's this about?

00:12.971 --> 00:15.140
- Who's he?
- Murray.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.268
You stopped taking yourmedication.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.395
I'm not crazy,
and you're not a psychiatrist.

00:20.896 --> 00:25.526
I'm running out of patience
and I really need to know.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.986
- What's that?
- A mobile computing device.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.198
I snuck it outta Tanner's bag.
It has multiple functions.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.866
So you gonna drug me again?

00:33.909 --> 00:38.121
It triggered what I laterrealised
was a suppressed memory.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.792
I'm not just interested in outer space.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.961
I'm from outer space.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.433
Early this morning, approximately 0230,

00:58.559 --> 01:02.938
the Kepler space probe captured
this image as it passed by Mars.

01:05.482 --> 01:09.111
- What is it?
- At first JPL thought it was an asteroid,

01:09.236 --> 01:12.239
but then they picked up
some strange energy readings.

01:12.322 --> 01:16.618
They tracked the object and realised
it was changing course and accelerating.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.787
Asteroids don't normally do that?

01:18.912 --> 01:21.915
No, sir. The only logical
conclusion is that it's a ship.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.918
- Do we have any way of identifying it?
- We do.

01:25.127 --> 01:29.506
The energy signature is consistent with
a technology we've encountered before.

01:29.590 --> 01:35.345
A year ago we found this pod
buried in a field near Billings, Montana.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.015
Martin.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.435
You mean the little guy with the pills
and the glasses and...

01:41.518 --> 01:46.773
- I thought his ship was destroyed.
- No, he said they came down in a pod.

01:46.899 --> 01:50.485
After abandoning the ship. He never
said what happened to it after that.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.696
If it is his ship, we better talk to him.

01:52.821 --> 01:56.742
Because it's on a course for Earth
and it'll be here in three days.

01:58.327 --> 02:02.122
Then we must locate
Martin Lloyd immediately.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.794
Hurry up, Major,
we need that force shield!

02:09.003 --> 02:12.591
I'm trying, but something's nullifying
the electrolyte on the generator!

02:13.008 --> 02:15.260
Try reversing the polarity!

02:15.719 --> 02:18.263
- It's not working!
- What do you mean?

02:18.388 --> 02:21.934
- I mean it's not working.
- God help us.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.895
Fire!

02:30.275 --> 02:32.319
And... cut!

02:39.952 --> 02:42.120
That was awful. We have to do it again.

02:42.246 --> 02:46.917
Check the gate. We are moving on.
Print everything! Nice job, people.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.628
- Good moves, Shawn.
- Um...

02:49.753 --> 02:56.093
Uh... yeah! Yeah, uh...
great... great job, everybody!

02:56.218 --> 02:58.262
Uh... yeah!

04:06.955 --> 04:10.209
Prepare foran x- treme adventure.

04:20.719 --> 04:25.474
Fourx- cellent heroes in
an x- traordinary new sci- fi series.

04:25.599 --> 04:29.353
Starring Nick Marlowe
as the wry Colonel Danning.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.898
As a matter offact,
it does say Colonel on my uniform.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.779
Hey, it's what I do.

04:40.072 --> 04:43.534
Yolanda Reese as the brilliant
Major Stacey Monroe.

04:43.659 --> 04:47.162
The field emitters are offline
but I can generate a feedback loop.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.289
Raymond Gunne as DrLevant.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.334
Dammit, just because
theirskulls are transparent,

04:52.459 --> 04:55.128
doesn't mean that they don't have rights!

05:03.846 --> 05:07.808
And introducing Douglas Anders
as Grell the robot.

05:12.563 --> 05:16.775
Wormhole X- treme.
Coming this fall, only on...

05:22.155 --> 05:24.992
Well, that looked... familiar.

05:26.410 --> 05:29.663
- I don't see it.
- Martin's involved in this?

05:29.788 --> 05:34.626
He sold the idea to the studio. He's on
the production as a creative consultant.

05:34.751 --> 05:38.088
- Then Martin has breached your security.
- Not necessarily.

05:38.172 --> 05:41.633
He got the whole thing from his
knowledge of the Stargate programme.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.678
If the air force disapproved
it wouldn't have got this far.

05:44.761 --> 05:48.682
Plausible deniability. In the event
of a future breach of security,

05:48.807 --> 05:52.311
we will be able to point
to this TV programme.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.062
If it stays on the air.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.648
Doesn't change the fact
that Marty sold us out.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.984
His motivations are of little concern.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.613
Our first priority is to find out
all he knows about that ship.

06:02.738 --> 06:06.783
Colonel, you're Wormhole X- treme's
new air- force consultant.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.248
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Bigger, much bigger.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.792
- Copy that.
- OK, so tomorrow we got 46 extras.

06:15.918 --> 06:20.214
Make sure everybody's ready. Hair,
make- up, wardrobe, costumes and props.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.550
Has the props show- and- tell
happened yet? Man, he's gonna freak.

06:23.675 --> 06:27.888
Excuse me. Do you know
where I can find a Martin Lloyd?

06:27.971 --> 06:32.601
- He's one of the bigwigs around here.
- Copy that. Sorry?

06:33.352 --> 06:36.813
- Martin Lloyd.
- Oh, yeah, over there, by the trailers.

06:36.939 --> 06:40.526
- Thank you.
- Who's that guy?

06:44.738 --> 06:47.241
Oh, they went with green?

06:47.366 --> 06:50.035
OK, it looks good. Great.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.331
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! What is that?

06:54.456 --> 06:56.458
It's fruit. Scene 23.

06:56.583 --> 07:01.046
OK, scene 23 takes place on another
planet. So you think aliens eat apples?

07:01.338 --> 07:04.258
Why not? They speak English.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.010
Get some kiwis and spray- paint them red.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.347
OK. So, now it'll go, uh...

07:10.430 --> 07:15.352
"Nick walks into the garden of kiwi trees,
says'How like Eden this world is',

07:15.477 --> 07:17.271
and bites into a painted kiwi. "

07:17.437 --> 07:22.693
OK, um, you're the prop master, right?
So, you're a master of props.

07:22.818 --> 07:24.862
So, figure it out.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.740
That's what you're wearing? OK.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.868
- Looks good.
- Martin?

07:30.993 --> 07:33.495
Yeah, yeah. Can I help you?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.581
Jack.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.334
Colonel Jack O'Neill?
United States Air Force?

07:39.459 --> 07:43.755
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're
the new military technical adviser. Right.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.925
Listen, uh, don't speak to the actors.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.053
Martin, it's Jack.

07:52.264 --> 07:55.350
- Remember Billings, Montana?
- I've never been.

07:55.434 --> 07:59.104
- But I am going to Sundance this year.
- What about the name Tanner?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.315
Dr Tanner?

08:01.440 --> 08:03.400
Hammond? Carter?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.944
- Murray?
- Sorry.

08:06.069 --> 08:11.241
I've got a concept meeting in ten minutes,
and if I'm not there on time, well...

08:12.284 --> 08:16.747
well, they start without me. But come
back tomorrow and I'll show you around.

08:34.139 --> 08:37.142
No. Look at my lips. Big- ger.

08:38.184 --> 08:42.231
- What have you got forus?
- Well, here's news.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.983
I think Martin's had
his memory erased again.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.403
Claims he doesn't rememberme
oranything about last year.

08:48.529 --> 08:52.991
- Tanner must have gotten to him first.
- Yeah, well, I checked out his trailer.

08:53.116 --> 08:57.162
I didn't find any medication,
but there are a lot of vitamins.

08:57.246 --> 09:00.833
Send in a sample for analysis.
In the meantime, keep an eye on Martin.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.085
Yes, sir.

09:03.669 --> 09:07.130
Sir, if Tanner is involved,
Colonel O'Neill could use some backup.

09:07.256 --> 09:10.509
I agree with you, Major.
You leave in one hour.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.349
I cannot thank you enough, Colonel.

09:17.474 --> 09:20.477
It's been many bleems
since my people were enslaved

09:20.561 --> 09:22.604
by the minions of Lord Varlock.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.274
Hey, it's what I do... do.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.484
- Aw, this isn't working!
- Cut!

09:31.446 --> 09:33.907
- Nick, what's up?
- It's meant to be a love scene.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.243
We're walking through dead aliens!

09:36.368 --> 09:39.037
Right. It's continuity.
You just killed them all.

09:39.121 --> 09:42.291
Yeah, yeah. Well, can't...
can't we walk somewhere else?

09:42.416 --> 09:44.710
Well, Nick, there is no somewhere else.

09:44.835 --> 09:48.213
This is the planet we have,
between here and here. That's the set.

09:48.422 --> 09:53.093
The reality of the scene dictates that there
be dead aliens, cos you just killed them.

09:53.218 --> 09:57.014
- We can always go back to the script.
- No, we can't.

09:57.139 --> 10:00.225
We've established that
one shot stuns, two shots kills.

10:00.309 --> 10:04.354
- Nick just shot everybody twice.
- So three shots disintegrates them.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.442
OK, you know what?
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that

10:08.567 --> 10:13.447
because that is quite possibly the
stupidest thing I've ever heard you say.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.286
Why are you looking at me like
I'm an idiot? Why are you on set?

10:19.369 --> 10:21.413
Go write something.

10:22.915 --> 10:26.960
Ooh! What colour is the beam
from the ray gun?

10:27.044 --> 10:29.713
We can't afford a beam. Sound effects.

10:30.839 --> 10:34.676
- It'll be great. You'll see. Reset!
- Back to ones.

10:34.801 --> 10:39.640
Look, Nick, Nick, Nick. It'll be in close- up.
The dead aliens'll be below frame.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.684
The audience is
gonna know they're there.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.816
OK. Kill the dead aliens.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.404
- Aliens off the set!
- Aliens off the set!

10:57.241 --> 10:59.910
I said "Aliens off the set. "

11:03.455 --> 11:06.542
Hey... it's what I do.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.503
It's what I do. It's what I do.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.883
- You're the new military adviser?
- Yes.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.094
You're the real deal, huh?

11:17.219 --> 11:19.972
- You seen action?
- That would be classified.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.307
Oh, I like that.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.310
Sorta like a "yes", but really a "no".

11:25.936 --> 11:28.689
This is realistic, right?

11:29.690 --> 11:32.150
The uniform.

11:32.276 --> 11:34.319
Camouflage.

11:38.365 --> 11:43.704
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You don't want to be
a target out there in... space.

11:43.829 --> 11:48.792
That's exactly what I said. So why
aren't the aliens ever in camouflage?

11:48.917 --> 11:51.003
Oh, I... I fought for that, uh, Nick.

11:51.128 --> 11:54.464
But the studio wants the aliens seen.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.801
An alien wouldn't want
to be seen, Martin. Think.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.804
Maybe that's why they're dead.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.728
That helps me. Thanks.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.440
- Can we do this?
- Doing this!

12:15.235 --> 12:17.529
The X. I know what you're thinkin'.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.115
Um, it's a marketing thing.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.744
You see, I wanted to call the show
Going to OtherPlanets,

12:23.869 --> 12:27.998
but research says that shows with
X in the name get higher ratings.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.458
Ah.

12:29.583 --> 12:34.129
Aaaa- aaaa- aaaaand action!

12:36.673 --> 12:41.053
The ship's on schedule. Preparations
for departure are almost complete.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.597
There's only one problem.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.271
This is gonna complicate matters.

12:58.779 --> 13:02.407
Very well. You have my authorisation
to begin surveillance.

13:02.533 --> 13:06.161
Keep a low profile, Major.
We don't want to show our hand.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.040
- Dr Fraiser.
- Surveillance on Martin Lloyd, I assume?

13:10.123 --> 13:14.586
His house, actually, to help determine
if Martin's old friends have returned.

13:14.711 --> 13:19.341
- Tanner.
- Tanner may have been watching Martin.

13:19.424 --> 13:24.429
Carter and Jackson will try to intercept
frequencies broadcast from his house.

13:24.555 --> 13:27.641
Oh, so like a surveillance surveillance?

13:27.766 --> 13:32.813
In a way. Are those the test results from
the vitamins found in Martin's trailer?

13:32.938 --> 13:36.024
Yes. They contained
a significant amount of the chemical

13:36.108 --> 13:39.278
that Tanner used to block
Martin's memory before.

13:39.361 --> 13:42.823
Which confirms
what we already suspected.

13:43.198 --> 13:47.035
The question is,
what do they want Martin to forget?

13:50.664 --> 13:54.001
- Excuse me.
- No, because it undermines my authority.

13:54.126 --> 13:56.545
- Guys...
- Ah, Miss Reese.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.839
Uh, I'm having trouble with scene 27.

13:58.964 --> 14:02.885
It says I'm "out of phase", so I can
pass my hand through solid matter

14:03.010 --> 14:07.556
- or walk through walls.
- Yeah, yeah, cos you're "out of phase".

14:07.681 --> 14:09.474
Um, exactly.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.061
So, how come I don't fall
through the floor?

14:26.491 --> 14:29.661
- We'll have to get back to you on that.
- All right.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.292
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:50.807 --> 14:51.892
No takers?

14:52.017 --> 14:55.646
This crew does not appear to enjoy
the traditional dishes of Chulak.

14:55.771 --> 14:59.107
- Show biz, huh?
- What happened to all the doughnuts?

14:59.191 --> 15:02.778
They were consumed by the drivers
before they retired to sleep.

15:02.903 --> 15:06.156
We wish to converse privately.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.453
Leave us!

15:15.916 --> 15:18.919
- Carter and Daniel?
- The investigation is ongoing.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.884
Sure the signal's coming
from inside Martin's house?

15:25.968 --> 15:31.723
I've gone over the triangulation three
times. I just have to match the frequency.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.892
Hold it. I've got somethin'.

15:35.727 --> 15:38.814
- Hidden cameras.
- Just like last time.

15:40.399 --> 15:43.402
Huh, look, I know it says
he's weightless in the script,

15:43.527 --> 15:47.114
but look what happens when
I scratch out the word "weightless".

15:47.239 --> 15:49.533
You see? He no longer
becomes "weightless".

15:49.658 --> 15:53.704
- He just "becomes".
- OK. Fine. Good.

15:53.787 --> 15:58.000
But how else does Colonel Danning
get past the giant alien guard?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.003
Why doesn't he just shoot him?

16:03.130 --> 16:05.424
- Who is this?
- Colonel Jack O'Neill.

16:05.549 --> 16:10.012
He's the new adviser. He doesn't know
he's not supposed to say anything yet.

16:10.137 --> 16:14.683
And you're telling me an officer can shoot
an alien without having to be weightless?

16:14.808 --> 16:18.478
- Sure. Why not?
- I'd like to hear "Why not?" more often.

16:19.438 --> 16:22.191
Now, the spaceship in scene 53.

16:22.316 --> 16:25.152
We have to see the ship.
It's crucial to the episode.

16:25.235 --> 16:29.531
We're gonna see it in their reactions.
It's like, my God, look at that ship! It's...

16:29.615 --> 16:31.658
indescribable.

16:33.243 --> 16:37.372
All right, you can do it. For $5, 000 less,
you can keep it in. Are we done?

16:37.748 --> 16:40.125
Uh, Marty has a problem
with a scene in act three.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.669
Oh, is that a fact, Marty?

16:42.794 --> 16:46.381
You have two- way travel
through a wormhole.

16:46.507 --> 16:48.383
- So?
- That's impossible.

16:48.509 --> 16:52.471
Matter can only move one way
through an open wormhole.

16:52.596 --> 16:55.432
The scene is scientifically unsound.

16:56.725 --> 17:00.062
OK, show of hands. Who here
has won a Cable Ace Award? Hm?

17:04.441 --> 17:06.401
Thank you.

17:06.527 --> 17:10.030
Oh, nice save with the
shooting- the- giant- alien beat. Clever!

17:11.198 --> 17:15.993
- Billy, make it go!
- Making it go. Back to ones, folks!

17:22.084 --> 17:24.502
I am the creative consultant on this show,

17:24.627 --> 17:29.341
which means that nothing should happen
creatively without me being consulted.

17:29.466 --> 17:32.302
He consulted you. He just didn't listen.

17:32.427 --> 17:37.099
You know what he did before? A show
about a talking dog who solves crimes.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.184
So what if they had 100 episodes?

17:39.309 --> 17:43.438
- Poochinsky?
- Yes, Poochinsky.

17:43.522 --> 17:46.275
Great show. Hey, Marty!

17:48.318 --> 17:50.362
Um...

17:52.948 --> 17:57.077
what makes you so sure matter can
only travel one way through a wormhole?

17:57.161 --> 17:59.163
I must've read it somewhere.

17:59.454 --> 18:02.708
And this secret government team
that goes to other planets.

18:02.791 --> 18:07.421
- Where'd that come from?
- It's based on a story I wrote last year.

18:07.504 --> 18:12.176
I couldn't get it published. I was about to
give up, and I got a call from the studio.

18:12.301 --> 18:15.637
To tell you the truth, I'm not even sure
how they got hold of it.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.432
So, you just made it up?

18:19.808 --> 18:23.353
Never ask a writer
where he gets his ideas.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.732
In truth, we don't know.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.575
- O'Neill.
- Colonel, we were right.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.703
Tanner and the others
have Martin under surveillance.

18:39.828 --> 18:43.707
It can't be a coincidence. It has to be
to do with the arrival of that ship.

18:43.832 --> 18:47.294
They may have tried to infiltrate
the studio. I'll see what I can dig up.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.379
Fire in the hole!

18:51.840 --> 18:56.220
Bigger! What is it about the word
"bigger" that you don't understand?

19:03.852 --> 19:07.189
The auditions are
in that building over there.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.692
I'm not auditioning. I'm with the air force.

19:11.485 --> 19:13.529
Colonel Jack O'Neill.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.659
Really.

19:20.452 --> 19:23.121
Do you keep a record
of everyone who comes and goes?

19:23.205 --> 19:25.415
It's for a security check.

19:25.541 --> 19:31.630
One of our generals is doing a guest spot
on the show. It's a small but pivotal role.

19:31.755 --> 19:34.925
I've got the licence plates
of every vehicle on file.

19:35.050 --> 19:38.595
Great. Would you mind
emailing them to that address?

19:38.720 --> 19:41.223
- OK. Sure.
- Thank you.

19:41.974 --> 19:44.017
I like the uniform.

19:50.858 --> 19:54.528
Why would somebody
with two PhDs become a teamster?

19:54.653 --> 19:56.697
The money, I guess.

19:57.781 --> 20:01.160
Wait a minute. This guy looks familiar.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.289
You're right. That's one of Tanner's men.

20:05.414 --> 20:10.419
Oh, according to this, he's a production
assistant named Steve Austin.

20:12.337 --> 20:15.007
I think we better pay Steve a little visit.

20:39.364 --> 20:42.618
- He's on his way up.
- Copy.

21:11.772 --> 21:13.815
Hello?

21:48.684 --> 21:51.019
So, where the hell did he go?

21:53.689 --> 21:57.526
Princess, I've seen a lot over the years:
the crystal rivers of Aradale,

21:57.651 --> 22:00.487
the blue volcanoes of Kash- tol- remi,

22:00.612 --> 22:04.449
even the starfires of Grablek 6,

22:07.035 --> 22:09.580
but none of it compares to you.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.666
What the...?

22:13.375 --> 22:16.044
- Cut!
- What was that? Who was that?

22:16.128 --> 22:18.547
- Tail slate.
- I want a name.

22:20.090 --> 22:22.634
It's me. Sorry, Nick.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.179
No problem. I'm sure it's important.

22:26.180 --> 22:29.683
- OK, that's lunch.
- Let me show you somethin' in my trailer.

22:33.145 --> 22:36.064
- O'Neill.
- Sir, we lost him.

22:36.148 --> 22:38.483
One minute he was here,
the next he was gone.

22:38.609 --> 22:42.154
- Yeah, they have a habit of doing that.
- We do have one lead, though.

22:42.321 --> 22:46.283
He made a quick phone call. We traced it
to a warehouse on the East Side.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.659
Bring backup this time.

22:47.784 --> 22:52.414
We don't have long before the ship enters
orbit. You'll have to confront Martin.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.583
I will.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.684
Let's go. You know what I was thinkin'?

23:12.809 --> 23:16.063
You know what this show needs?
A sexy female alien.

23:16.146 --> 23:18.398
- Trust me.
- Marty! Marty, you got a second?

23:18.524 --> 23:22.569
Oh, well, now's not really a good time.
I'm supposed to have...

23:24.488 --> 23:26.573
OK, now's good.

23:26.698 --> 23:29.952
"The colonel stood before
the pool of shimmering light,

23:30.035 --> 23:34.081
fascinated by the dancing ripples
in the event horizon. "

23:34.164 --> 23:37.000
"What mysteries lay beyond
this mystical portal?"

23:37.084 --> 23:41.755
"What wonders awaited him
and his band of stalwart cohorts?"

23:42.881 --> 23:44.925
- Pretty good, huh?
- Damn good.

23:45.050 --> 23:49.263
The only difference from the original is
that there was a fifth member of the team.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.974
He was a handsome, smooth- talkin' alien

23:52.099 --> 23:56.061
who was stranded on Earth
when his crew deserted him.

23:56.186 --> 23:59.648
The, uh, producers
made me cut that part out.

23:59.815 --> 24:01.942
You have no clue
where you got this idea?

24:02.067 --> 24:04.152
Well, like I said...

24:04.278 --> 24:07.114
Martin, it's all true.

24:09.408 --> 24:13.453
- What are you talking about?
- Wormholes, travelling to other planets:

24:13.787 --> 24:16.331
it's all real.

24:17.875 --> 24:20.794
I command a unit called SG-1.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.548
It's the advance team
of a secret military operation.

24:24.756 --> 24:28.594
We explore the universe
through a device called the Stargate.

24:29.636 --> 24:33.223
- The crew put you up to this, didn't they?
- Here's the kicker, Marty.

24:33.348 --> 24:37.561
You know all about it.
You've been through the Stargate.

24:37.686 --> 24:40.689
Unfortunately, you've had
your memory erased.

24:40.772 --> 24:44.985
So, what? Um...
I'm a member of this SG-1?

24:45.110 --> 24:47.863
- No.
- Then, how do I know about it?

24:51.033 --> 24:54.369
Because you're not
just interested in outer space.

24:54.495 --> 24:57.498
You're from outer space.

24:59.291 --> 25:05.047
Is this a pitch? Alien crash- lands.
We have to find him before it's too late.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.549
- Only, his memory's been erased.
- Martin.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.594
No, no, no. It's not bad.
If we just add a twist...

25:16.016 --> 25:18.435
I'm needed on the set.

25:18.560 --> 25:23.607
Why don't you type up what you have?
I'll take a look at the coverage on it.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.443
Oh, uh...

25:26.568 --> 25:28.278
No promises.

25:38.622 --> 25:41.458
- Perimeter's secure. Awaiting orders.
- Let's move in.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.585
Move in! Move in!

25:54.054 --> 25:56.014
Nobody move!

25:57.140 --> 25:59.977
Drop your weapons! Drop them!

26:05.232 --> 26:10.153
- Lower your weapons!
- You drop your weapons. Now.

26:10.279 --> 26:12.698
I'm Major Carter, United States Air Force.

26:12.823 --> 26:15.367
And I'm Agent Malcolm Barrett, NID.

26:20.622 --> 26:25.002
- NID? What the hell's going on here?
- We've been set up.

26:31.758 --> 26:36.054
Hello? Someone paged me to stage six!

26:37.931 --> 26:39.975
Hello?

26:50.903 --> 26:52.946
Hello?

27:02.831 --> 27:04.875
- Hey!
- Ah!

27:06.293 --> 27:08.462
Marty, relax.

27:11.173 --> 27:12.341
What's goin' on?

27:12.466 --> 27:15.219
I guess the crew's just playing a prank

27:15.302 --> 27:18.805
by paging me to a stage
we're not shooting on.

27:19.306 --> 27:21.642
It... it happens all the time. It's, uh...

27:22.142 --> 27:24.186
out of respect, really.

27:25.187 --> 27:27.689
Huh! Hey, n- nice one, guys!

27:29.942 --> 27:31.985
All right, stay with me.

27:44.873 --> 27:47.376
Hello, Colonel.

27:54.383 --> 27:56.844
Tanner, I presume.

27:59.555 --> 28:02.391
- Is he with you?
- Don't worry, Martin.

28:02.599 --> 28:05.185
Everything will become clear in time.

28:08.355 --> 28:10.858
Gentlemen, the colonel's weapon.

28:34.798 --> 28:37.718
- This is really bad.
- Relax.

28:37.843 --> 28:40.929
They're shooting the big finale.
I have to be there.

28:41.013 --> 28:44.391
I can see how that's high on
your list of priorities right now.

28:44.516 --> 28:47.519
Couldn't you have dealt with them?
Why drag me into it?

28:47.644 --> 28:51.607
Marty! You are the reason we're here.

28:51.732 --> 28:55.235
Oh, don't start with
that outer- space stuff again.

28:55.652 --> 28:58.322
Martin, the vitamins you've been taking

28:58.405 --> 29:02.284
are laced with a chemical that suppresses
your memory. I had'em analysed.

29:02.409 --> 29:04.661
OK, fine. I'm an alien.

29:04.786 --> 29:08.290
- Whatever.
- They are aliens too.

29:08.415 --> 29:13.420
- They're from your planet.
- That is the stupidest act- four opening.

29:13.545 --> 29:16.632
You should stick with the air force.
A writer, you're not.

29:22.471 --> 29:25.641
Hey, how go the travel plans?

29:26.016 --> 29:28.769
Spaceship on time and all?

29:34.107 --> 29:36.276
I only ask cos I care.

29:36.401 --> 29:39.154
Uh, guys, I'm kinda out of the loop here.

29:39.279 --> 29:43.909
But, um, since I work in the TV business
and I don't really know anything,

29:43.992 --> 29:48.205
I was wondering if you would consider,
uh, letting me go, bec...

29:49.957 --> 29:52.000
Oh.

29:54.711 --> 29:57.548
I'm hoping that's your insulin shot.

30:05.430 --> 30:08.433
Honestly, needles make me kinda queasy.

30:08.517 --> 30:11.854
Don't worry. Just a little something
to help you remember.

30:12.020 --> 30:16.149
Oh, just tell me what you want me
to remember and I'll remember it.

30:24.700 --> 30:27.786
Yeah, yeah, we'll rewrite it. It'll be great.

30:32.666 --> 30:35.252
- Let's go over this again.
- You want a diagram?

30:35.377 --> 30:38.714
- They led us straight to you.
- The aliens?

30:38.839 --> 30:43.468
Yes, the aliens. Please, Mr Man in Black,
don't pretend you don't know about them.

30:43.552 --> 30:45.721
Now we can't get ahold of Colonel O'Neill.

30:45.846 --> 30:48.348
We have to go to the set,
find out what's going on.

30:48.473 --> 30:54.062
You're going nowhere. The NID's been
given full authority over this investigation.

30:59.526 --> 31:02.446
- O'Neill.
- Teal'c.

31:04.490 --> 31:08.243
- How'd you find us?
- I witnessed your abduction.

31:08.452 --> 31:12.164
- Where's Tanner?
- He and his men have again disappeared.

31:12.998 --> 31:15.584
The real money's in syndication.

31:15.709 --> 31:18.545
Martin. Martin, come on.

31:19.213 --> 31:21.673
If you wanna have lunch,
call my assistant.

31:21.798 --> 31:23.842
Marty!

31:27.137 --> 31:29.181
Colonel O'Neill?

31:30.265 --> 31:32.309
Murray.

31:32.768 --> 31:35.687
- You remember?
- Yeah.

31:35.771 --> 31:38.690
The antidote worked.
I remember everything now.

31:38.899 --> 31:42.152
Marty, what happened?
Why'd they drug you again?

31:42.277 --> 31:44.279
They didn't.

31:46.448 --> 31:48.909
- I did it to myself.
- For what reason?

31:49.034 --> 31:55.999
When we went back to my planet and we
saw that it was gone, I couldn't handle it.

31:56.166 --> 32:01.588
And the real- estate job was driving me
crazy. I just wanted to forget everything.

32:01.922 --> 32:04.299
You were gonna
keep takin' pills all your life?

32:04.424 --> 32:08.971
Another month and the long- term
memory loss would've been permanent.

32:09.596 --> 32:11.640
Oh... oh, no!

32:11.932 --> 32:17.437
- What is the matter, Martin Lloyd?
- The show is based on your programme.

32:17.563 --> 32:20.232
Don't worry. It's on cable.

32:20.357 --> 32:22.609
So, why'd they bring you
out of it? Why now?

32:22.734 --> 32:25.904
The ship's coming. We put it on a timer.

32:25.988 --> 32:28.907
A backup plan in case
things didn't go right here.

32:28.991 --> 32:31.910
- Why do they need you?
- I have the mobile computing device

32:31.994 --> 32:35.581
I stole from Tanner.
They need it to access the ship.

32:36.206 --> 32:40.085
- Where is it?
- Don't worry. It's in a safe place.

32:40.544 --> 32:42.754
- And rolling!
- Sound, speed.

32:44.047 --> 32:46.592
- Scanning with the Quatroscanner.
- I don't have it.

32:46.717 --> 32:48.427
- Cut!
- Don't stop rolling!

32:48.552 --> 32:50.596
Still speeding.

32:50.721 --> 32:53.974
Kenny, run, you underpaid,
below- the- line freak!

32:54.099 --> 32:56.852
- Billy, roll right now!
- Roll.

32:57.853 --> 33:01.273
Kenny, I love you,
but you're not in this scene! Out!

33:01.398 --> 33:02.858
- Billy!
- Roll!

33:02.941 --> 33:04.985
Speed! Speed! Speeding!

33:06.236 --> 33:07.362
Action!

33:13.160 --> 33:15.996
It has to be here somewhere.

33:16.079 --> 33:19.833
You used a real alien device
as a prop on the show.

33:19.958 --> 33:22.336
Well, I'd forgotten what it was at the time.

33:22.461 --> 33:25.297
Do you have any idea
what it costs to make one of these?

33:25.422 --> 33:28.592
- Can I help you?
- We're looking for the Quatroscanner.

33:28.675 --> 33:31.428
- Ah. It's at the location.
- What?

33:31.553 --> 33:33.096
Why?

33:33.222 --> 33:36.558
- Somebody put it in the scene.
- How come?

33:36.642 --> 33:38.519
I don't know. I just do my job, man.

33:38.644 --> 33:40.687
- Let's go.
- Murray.

33:48.570 --> 33:50.447
Yeah, get me Agent Barrett.

33:51.031 --> 33:54.952
All right, good work. Let's go, guys.
We got'em. You two stay here.

33:55.077 --> 33:58.455
- What?
- We want this ship. It's too important.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.457
Frankly, I don't trust you.

34:00.541 --> 34:04.169
Agent Smith, watch over these two
and make sure they don't move.

34:04.294 --> 34:06.338
Let's go, guys.

34:20.185 --> 34:23.647
Murray, look around.
Marty, you're with me.

34:29.695 --> 34:33.574
I'm picking up the same gamma radiation
we came across in the photon belt.

34:33.699 --> 34:38.245
That doesn't make sense. Those
aliens couldn't have just disappeared,

34:38.370 --> 34:40.539
could they... have?

34:40.664 --> 34:43.333
And turn, turn... Doug!

34:44.251 --> 34:47.420
Cut! Perfect! And tail slate.

34:47.545 --> 34:51.382
Good. Doug, you were supposed to
turn to me. OK, print everything!

34:51.507 --> 34:53.552
Moving on!

34:54.344 --> 34:55.637
- Good scene.
- Thanks.

34:55.762 --> 34:59.266
You really nailed it.
Let me take this stuff for you.

34:59.391 --> 35:01.685
Here you go.

35:01.810 --> 35:03.854
Yellow!

35:07.316 --> 35:11.778
- Let's go.
- No, they're about to shoot the big finish.

35:11.862 --> 35:15.240
- Too bad.
- I'm not leaving, Colonel.

35:16.992 --> 35:19.036
OK, maybe I am.

35:28.504 --> 35:31.006
You can control the ship
from here with this?

35:31.131 --> 35:33.800
Uh, maybe, but do I have to?

35:33.926 --> 35:35.969
Yes, Marty, you...

35:37.638 --> 35:40.140
You can hand me the device, Colonel.

35:41.725 --> 35:44.978
- Well, this is gettin' old.
- Lower your weapons.

35:49.358 --> 35:54.363
- Looks like we have a situation.
- No, guys, you can walk away from this.

35:54.488 --> 35:58.534
- We're not gonna come after you.
- What about your friends at the NID?

35:58.659 --> 36:00.702
No more hiding. Where's the device?

36:00.994 --> 36:02.955
What device?

36:03.205 --> 36:08.961
Colonel, we let you escape because we
knew Martin would lead you right to it.

36:11.171 --> 36:14.007
That's me. Mind if I...?

36:20.097 --> 36:21.557
- O'Neill.
- Sir, it's me.

36:21.682 --> 36:24.601
- Hey, how you doin'?
- The NID have made your position.

36:24.685 --> 36:27.187
They'll be there any minute.

36:29.982 --> 36:32.651
- Everything all right?
- It is now.

36:35.779 --> 36:37.823
I'll be in touch.

36:40.492 --> 36:42.995
Time's up, guys. The NID's on its way.

36:44.496 --> 36:46.456
Look!

36:47.082 --> 36:49.918
They're too late! I'm OK, Murray.

37:03.599 --> 37:06.518
We should return to the portal
before the aliens return.

37:06.602 --> 37:10.272
What? What? I haven't finished
translating the alien text.

37:10.397 --> 37:12.649
Grell, what do you think?

37:13.609 --> 37:16.361
What the hell is that?

37:16.445 --> 37:19.781
- Is that ours?
- Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

37:20.782 --> 37:24.244
Yeah, keep rolling!
Pan around, you monkeys!

37:25.245 --> 37:30.083
Hey, what's this about? I'm supposed
to be in all the cool scenes!

37:30.292 --> 37:32.336
Tilt up! Tilt up!

37:54.691 --> 37:59.404
Colonel, please. You know as well as I do
they're never gonna leave us alone.

38:03.784 --> 38:07.120
There's nothing for us here.
It's time for us to go.

38:22.386 --> 38:25.055
You officially owe me one.

38:26.974 --> 38:31.186
- What about Martin?
- I believe Martin has chosen a new path.

38:40.028 --> 38:42.072
We're gonna win an Emmy for this!

38:42.990 --> 38:45.242
Visual Effects category.

38:46.493 --> 38:49.163
Thank you, Colonel. We won't forget this.

39:10.267 --> 39:13.103
Cut it! Print it! That's a wrap!

39:13.645 --> 39:15.689
Yeah, cut!

39:16.857 --> 39:18.901
Cool special effect.

39:19.026 --> 39:21.695
- I've seen better.
- Ah, we'll fix it in post.

39:21.820 --> 39:25.073
Yeah. So, you think we can get 18 in?

39:25.657 --> 39:29.620
Yeah, if we cut back on the mulligans.
You think that's funny?

39:29.745 --> 39:32.331
Yeah, it's good enough for a walkaway.

39:32.998 --> 39:35.083
When's a good time to fade out?

39:35.209 --> 39:37.252
Uh, right about...

39:38.170 --> 39:40.047
now.

39:42.549 --> 39:48.138
Stay tuned fora behind- the- scenes
look at Wormhole X- treme!

39:54.728 --> 39:57.898
I'm Christian Bocher.
I'm portraying Raymond Gunne,

39:58.023 --> 40:00.275
who portrays the character of Dr Levant,

40:00.400 --> 40:03.570
which is based on the character,
uh, Daniel Jackson,

40:03.654 --> 40:08.492
portrayed by the actor, Michael Shanks,
originally portrayed by James Spader -

40:08.617 --> 40:10.661
in the feature film.

40:11.829 --> 40:13.205
Are you OK?

40:13.288 --> 40:15.332
- Action!
- Look out!

40:15.999 --> 40:18.043
Agh!

40:18.585 --> 40:21.672
Agh! Ow! Argh!

40:25.926 --> 40:27.970
And... cut!

40:28.971 --> 40:31.557
- No, no, no!
- Are you OK?

40:31.682 --> 40:34.685
No, I'm not OK! You... you go!

40:34.977 --> 40:38.438
- Ice. Can I get some ice?
- All right, let's get some ice in here.

40:38.772 --> 40:41.608
- And this is the eye line.
- Wormhole X- treme.

40:41.692 --> 40:44.695
Enjoy the space. You can do
anything with space. You know...

40:44.820 --> 40:48.365
You got the space between your teeth,
the space... personal space...

40:48.490 --> 40:50.909
Right. OK. So... you're standing here.

40:53.412 --> 40:56.790
As a matter of fact, it does say
Colonel on my uniform.

40:59.918 --> 41:02.337
You know, it doesn't say Colonel.

41:02.462 --> 41:06.842
- Did anyone ever think of that?
- Um, it's just a figure of speech.

41:08.552 --> 41:13.640
It's a figure of speech I can't figure out.
I'm not seeing Colonel on my uniform.

41:14.600 --> 41:18.979
Uh, OK, somebody get me the word
"Colonel". Uh, gimme a Sharpie pen.

41:19.104 --> 41:21.231
Could it be here? Could it be here?

41:23.025 --> 41:28.530
- You realise this is not a real show.
- You saying Wormhole X- treme isn't real?

41:28.655 --> 41:31.992
- All this is...?
- It's not a real show. It's a fake show.

41:32.201 --> 41:34.244
Did my agent know about this?

41:34.453 --> 41:37.122
You're heroic. Just look
over at this eye line.

41:37.206 --> 41:39.958
- This isn't a real show?
- No, it's not a real show.

41:40.042 --> 41:42.878
If it's not a real show,
why are you telling me what to do?

41:43.003 --> 41:47.299
How could this not be a real show,
if we're doing it right now?

41:47.549 --> 41:50.886
- Am I getting paid real money?
- Yeah, real money.

41:51.011 --> 41:55.390
Well... Whoa. So what
plane of reality are we on right now?

41:59.520 --> 42:02.189
Hey, it's what I do.

42:06.735 --> 42:11.365
Are you sure you can't see the difference
in our height? Can I get a half apple?

42:11.448 --> 42:14.535
I'm looking up her nose.
You don't have to hit me that hard.

42:14.618 --> 42:17.371
You can really see
the difference in height.

42:17.496 --> 42:22.417
- You... No, I don't, uh... It's not obvious.
- Look, look, I'm gonna measure it.

42:22.543 --> 42:26.004
- I'm like, I'm like...
- No, but on this lens, it looks right.

42:26.129 --> 42:28.799
From this angle,
we look the same height?

42:28.924 --> 42:32.094
- I swear to God.
- You wouldn't lie to me?

42:32.386 --> 42:35.806
- How come I never get to kiss anybody?
- Well, it's, uh...

42:35.931 --> 42:39.560
- Episodes are being written for you soon.
- Sure.

42:39.768 --> 42:42.062
Just one eyebrow.

42:42.187 --> 42:44.398
No, just the one.

42:45.148 --> 42:47.818
And turn your back to me.

42:47.901 --> 42:51.947
Turn all the way around to me and do
that annoying thing and then look away.

42:52.030 --> 42:54.032
And... action.

42:54.158 --> 42:58.620
- How could this not be a real show?
- Oh, forget it. Just turn.
