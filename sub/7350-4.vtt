WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:08.442
Party!
Yeah! NOP!

00:08.476 --> 00:11.079
(dance music playing,
crowd chatter)

00:15.583 --> 00:18.352
* Gonna make you mine
forever... *

00:18.386 --> 00:20.354
Dude, I think she's dead.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.223
Should we call security?

00:22.256 --> 00:24.125
Oh...

00:24.158 --> 00:26.060
* You can run, you can hide

00:26.094 --> 00:28.296
I need another drink.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.364
* Girl, I'm gonna
make you mine... *

00:30.398 --> 00:31.765
BOTH:
Zombie!

00:31.799 --> 00:34.535
Freshmen.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.638
* It's just forever

00:37.671 --> 00:41.142
* Never stop until you love me

00:41.175 --> 00:43.677
* Even if you treat me cold

00:45.213 --> 00:47.548
* I'll love you
till we decompose... *

00:47.581 --> 00:49.083
What?!

00:57.191 --> 00:58.826
Natalie?

01:01.529 --> 01:03.131
Natalie!

01:05.199 --> 01:06.400
Natalie...

01:09.537 --> 01:11.339
Natalie, open up.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.343
Natalie...

01:17.378 --> 01:18.512
Natalie!

01:22.150 --> 01:24.485
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:24.518 --> 01:27.121
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:27.155 --> 01:29.623
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:29.657 --> 01:31.125
* How, how, how, how

01:31.159 --> 01:33.227
* Hey, hey

01:39.233 --> 01:40.468
* You gotta come on.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.272
Laurel,
because you're King's daughter,

01:44.305 --> 01:47.208
I'm gonna take it easy on you
when the Tide rolls your Tigers.

01:47.241 --> 01:48.642
Oh, you're just scared, Chris,

01:48.676 --> 01:50.478
'cause you know
this is our year.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.281
Hey, Agent Brody,
where'd you go to school?

01:53.314 --> 01:55.449
Michigan State.
A Spartan!

01:55.483 --> 01:57.385
Won the Big Ten
last year.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.287
Really
I don't really root.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.222
I'm not a rooter.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.856
Oh, that's so sad.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.592
All right, listen up,
everybody...

02:04.625 --> 02:07.195
Music major in the house.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.862
Hey, Dad.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.698
You didn't tell me you
were coming to town.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.266
Oh.
Everything all right?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.934
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just here for the weekend.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.569
Gonna see some friends

02:15.603 --> 02:17.438
and catch Batiste
at the Apple Barrel and...

02:17.471 --> 02:18.872
Homemade gumbo?

02:18.906 --> 02:21.375
In the big blue bowl,
please.
Promise.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.910
But first, we got work.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.879
Dead sailor at
New Orleans Poly.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.481
Let's load up.

02:31.285 --> 02:34.488
Victim's name is Petty
Officer T.J. Blake.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.957
This is University Police
Officer Mike Banton.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.893
He was first on the scene,
found the victim's wallet,
called it in.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.563
Door was locked?
Yes, sir. Like I told
lovely Agent Brody there,

02:42.596 --> 02:44.765
that I was dealing
with a feral cat crisis

02:44.798 --> 02:46.267
when I got the call about this.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.636
So far, no sign of a gun.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.972
Loretta, can you give us some
idea of what we're looking for?

02:52.005 --> 02:54.675
Entry wound appears to be small
caliber-- best guess, handgun.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.945
Won't know any specifics
until I get back to autopsy.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.580
All right, let's get started.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.982
Christopher,
have NOPD do a canvass.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.817
Brody, prep a DPA.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.319
Pride, something else.

03:05.353 --> 03:08.489
There's stippling
around the wound.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.558
Shot was up close and personal.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.760
Yeah.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.397
I met T.J. during the party.

03:16.430 --> 03:20.368
He was really sweet
and funny, and we just...

03:20.401 --> 03:22.270
hit it off and started drinking.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.973
We went upstairs
to my room,

03:26.006 --> 03:28.776
and passed out,
and when I woke up, he was dead.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.244
Shot dead.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.445
You didn't hear anything?

03:31.479 --> 03:32.880
Didn't see anyone
in your room?

03:32.913 --> 03:35.283
No. What... what is that for?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.984
It's a gunshot
residue test.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.553
May I?

03:40.754 --> 03:43.357
Tilda, you hear anything?

03:43.391 --> 03:45.293
Maybe see Petty
Officer Blake

03:45.326 --> 03:47.795
get into an argument
with someone at the party?

03:47.828 --> 03:49.763
Oh, I was kind of out of it.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.565
This is just all
really gross.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.966
Did you see him?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.503
He was bleeding all over
her Zini.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.039
You two stay put.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.974
We may have some more questions.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.376
Excuse me.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.314
Okay, fill me in.
What's a Zini?

04:06.347 --> 04:08.549
It's a designer throw rug,
really expensive.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.718
Like, a thousand dollars.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.353
Since when do college girls

04:12.386 --> 04:14.455
have thousand-dollar rugs
in their rooms?

04:14.488 --> 04:16.724
Since their rich daddy started
sending them to NOP.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.392
Went to boarding school
with girls like that.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.561
We didn't get along.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.364
Natalie's negative for GSR.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.865
Not a surprise.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.967
The blood on her arms
stops at her wrists.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.502
So she washed her hands.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.371
Still need to locate the weapon.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.706
Given what we've got,
she's our one and only suspect.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.007
Not so fast...

04:34.041 --> 04:35.343
"lovely" Agent Brody.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.345
Ordinary bobby pin.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.812
Where'd you get that?

04:38.846 --> 04:41.382
Her name's Diane.
She's a kinesiology major.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.283
With what, a minor in Zumba?

04:45.386 --> 04:46.854
These buildings are ancient,

04:46.887 --> 04:49.657
which means the lock
is easy to...

04:52.593 --> 04:54.995
Voilà.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.598
So that means anyone at
the party could be our shooter.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.567
But Officer Banton said the
only way into the sorority house

04:59.600 --> 05:01.101
last night was
through the front door

05:01.134 --> 05:03.504
and anyone who went in or out
was caught on camera.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.806
How many people was that?
In the neighborhood of 200.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.375
It's not one,

05:07.408 --> 05:08.275
but not terrible.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.344
You know how I got
into parties in college?

05:10.378 --> 05:13.681
Snuck in through the side door.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.384
There's always a way
to sneak in.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.486
All the windows have
security locks,

05:18.519 --> 05:19.920
doors have alarms.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.356
So much for that theory.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.357
PRIDE:
Not so fast.

05:23.391 --> 05:26.059
There's dirt
on the floor here.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.539
Where does that go?

05:38.572 --> 05:40.874
Christopher, stay here.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.876
Dust this door for prints.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.413
Brody, you come with me.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.149
Tunnels below sea level?

05:49.182 --> 05:52.520
These old houses

05:52.553 --> 05:54.555
were all once owned
by the wealthy,

05:54.588 --> 05:57.458
and when the upstairs folk

05:57.491 --> 06:00.794
wanted to have interactions
with the downstairs folk,

06:00.828 --> 06:03.096
sometimes a good tunnel
would come in handy.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.698
Let's keep an eye out
for anything

06:04.732 --> 06:06.967
the killer may have
left behind.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.538
Yeah, well, I'm only seeing
dirt and God knows what.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.407
Ah.

06:13.441 --> 06:16.444
PRIDE: Well, there's one suspect
to cross off the list.

06:18.011 --> 06:18.979
Over here!

06:21.014 --> 06:23.451
Whoever murdered
Petty Officer Blake

06:23.484 --> 06:24.418
might've gone up this way!

06:25.653 --> 06:28.522
And come out...

06:35.929 --> 06:37.498
BRODY:
Where are we?

06:37.531 --> 06:38.599
The middle of the city.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.901
So...

06:40.934 --> 06:42.436
we went from one suspect

06:42.470 --> 06:44.071
to 200

06:44.104 --> 06:45.806
to how many people are
in New Orleans

06:45.839 --> 06:46.807
on any given weekend?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.910
A million, give or take.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.513
Great.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.515
That's just great.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.495
Oh, sorry...

07:07.528 --> 07:09.597
Very impressive, Sebastian.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.898
Where'd you learn
how to do this?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.900
Uh, I got my, uh,
Red Cross certification

07:12.933 --> 07:14.768
when I was dorm captain
in college.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.737
It's a good way
to meet girls.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.806
What happened?
I met a few.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.241
Well...
Eloise, she was Pre-Med.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.110
She fainted after she got this
really bad paper cut, though.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.645
I meant Loretta's wound.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.113
It's a work hazard.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.483
I cut my finger on the bullet
that killed your vic.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.851
It's a black talon.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.954
Sharp spikes
open up on impact,

07:33.987 --> 07:35.723
deepening the wound and
imbedding the bullet

07:35.756 --> 07:37.558
in the tissue.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.593
Makes it difficult to grip
with the tweezers,

07:39.627 --> 07:41.495
so I use my fingers badly.

07:41.529 --> 07:44.498
E.R. doctors have been trying
to get them banned for years.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.834
And ever since Gian Luigi Ferri
killed nine people

07:46.867 --> 07:48.569
during his rampage
in San Francisco.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.638
You know, most folks thought
that he was a nut,

07:50.671 --> 07:53.040
but he said he was the victim of
too much monosodium glutamate.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.175
Oh, the MSG made him do it.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.579
Sebastian's a connoisseur
of conspiracy theories.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.280
Well, they're
not conspiracies, okay?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.015
They're discernments.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.951
Just wait till I show you how
the fake moon landing

08:03.984 --> 08:05.786
fits in with why
we haven't found Bigfoot yet.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.188
WADE:
I also found

08:08.221 --> 08:10.290
minute plastic fragments.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.926
And given the lack of
gunshot residue near the wound,

08:12.960 --> 08:14.828
it could've come from some kind
of improvised silencer

08:14.862 --> 08:16.229
that the killer made.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.131
Makes sense;
he creates his own silencer.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.568
That's one less thing
for law enforcement to track.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.570
He also has bruising
on the arm.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.137
He fought with his attacker.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.174
Chief Petty Officer Blake died
around 9:00 p.m.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.877
The color of those bruises
tell me

08:29.910 --> 08:32.880
that they happened maybe five,
six hours before his death.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.247
Got Blake on surveillance

08:34.281 --> 08:36.684
entering the sorority
at 7:30 p.m.

08:36.717 --> 08:40.788
Who did he fight with
before he went to that party?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.623
Running prints
on the tunnel door.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.057
So far, only misdemeanors.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.159
Urinating in public,
sleeping in fountains

08:46.193 --> 08:47.895
and stealing mascots.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.697
Things I'm sure
you're familiar with.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.332
Magna cum laude,
3.7 GPA,

08:52.365 --> 08:54.935
didn't even have
to go to class.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.170
How's the surveillance
from Officer Banton?

08:57.204 --> 08:59.072
He sure liked you.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.340
Delicious, warm beignets.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.342
Put in your mouths,

09:02.375 --> 09:04.878
eat, speak of things
you've learned.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.279
Our victim.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.682
Petty Officer
First Class Blake,

09:08.716 --> 09:13.020
a Navy SEAL, stationed at
the Stennis Riverine Facility.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.187
That's it?

09:14.221 --> 09:16.189
Well, his missions
were classified.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.858
So he is as well.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.993
But I did speak with
a contact at SOCOM

09:20.027 --> 09:22.930
who will hopefully have
a detailed bio for me soon.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.198
What's a Navy SEAL doing
at a college party?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.267
LASALLE:
Beyond the obvious?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.169
None of the attendees
have a connect with him,

09:29.202 --> 09:32.005
other than Natalie Lane.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.041
The girl we found
with the body.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.342
Originally from Seattle,

09:35.375 --> 09:36.944
sophomore at NOP,

09:36.977 --> 09:39.312
dean's list and
a part-time tutor.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.683
Everyone says she's a peach.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.952
All right, think, ideas.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.655
What happened at that party?

09:47.688 --> 09:49.957
Lots of college kids,
alcohol flowing.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.760
Guy tries to take advantage.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.227
She shoots him in self-defense.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.730
Not the picture Natalie painted.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.700
Nothing but praise
for Petty Officer Blake.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.902
You know, I'm not sure if
or how this is related,

10:01.935 --> 10:04.738
but my contact at SOCOM said
that Blake's platoon

10:04.772 --> 10:06.774
had issues during a mission
in Somalia.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.876
So you're saying because
of some weirdness in Somalia,

10:08.909 --> 10:10.343
one of his own guys killed him?

10:10.377 --> 10:12.746
No, I think Natalie did it.
Maybe she was in shock

10:12.780 --> 10:14.247
when she talked with you.
I don't know,

10:14.281 --> 10:16.016
but she was in a locked room
with Blake.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.350
She washed her hands

10:17.384 --> 10:19.419
and somehow that gun disappeared
before we arrived?

10:19.452 --> 10:22.690
But if she didn't?

10:22.723 --> 10:25.092
Who better to sneak
into a house,

10:25.125 --> 10:27.194
access a locked room,

10:27.227 --> 10:28.929
shoot Blake

10:28.962 --> 10:30.163
with a black talon bullets

10:30.197 --> 10:31.965
and leave without
anyone the wiser?

10:31.999 --> 10:33.834
Piece of cake for a SEAL.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.904
All right.

10:36.937 --> 10:40.040
I'll speak to Blake's
master chief,

10:40.073 --> 10:41.441
find out more about Blake

10:41.474 --> 10:45.078
and that mission in Somalia.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.914
LASALLE:
King, you know how
SEALs don't like

10:46.947 --> 10:48.381
anyone poking in
their business,

10:48.415 --> 10:51.084
especially NCIS.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.320
I'll use my
gentle face.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.999
I was Petty Officer Blake's
instructor during BUDS training.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.135
I watched him become a leader.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.871
Not only is his death
a blow to the team,

11:10.904 --> 11:12.105
but to me personally.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.907
My condolences.

11:13.941 --> 11:14.975
How's his family?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.209
We're it.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.477
His parents were Marines.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.013
They died on 9/11
at the Pentagon.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.849
Makes no sense
why he was at that party.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.016
Meaning?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.317
It was important
to Blake

11:24.351 --> 11:25.753
to set an example

11:25.786 --> 11:26.954
for the men
on the team.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.822
Then he's killed
at a college kegger?

11:28.856 --> 11:30.090
Sickens me.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.725
Got any leads?

11:31.759 --> 11:33.360
We're looking into
whatever happened

11:33.393 --> 11:35.128
after the mission
in Somalia.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.997
Wish I could talk
to you about that.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.199
Spec ops missions
are classified.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.467
Let's go, gentlemen!

11:40.500 --> 11:41.902
Chop chop!

11:41.935 --> 11:43.436
Then read me into it.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.008
Agent Pride,
I am sure as my life

11:48.041 --> 11:51.044
none of Blake's SEALmates had
anything to do with his death.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.146
If you need to talk
to someone...

11:53.180 --> 11:54.815
Max Wolf.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.283
Which one is he?

11:56.316 --> 11:57.918
BENSON:
He's none of them.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.954
Like I said: not a SEAL.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.290
Let's go!
Quicker, quicker!

12:03.323 --> 12:05.959
PRIDE:
Max Wolf is a mercenary

12:05.993 --> 12:07.494
who provided support
to the SEALs

12:07.527 --> 12:09.329
during the mission in Somalia.

12:09.362 --> 12:12.499
He was caught trying to steal
a ring from a terrorist

12:12.532 --> 12:14.234
by cuttin' off his finger.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.004
Blake stopped him,
reported him,

12:17.037 --> 12:19.172
and he was fired.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.241
So Blake reports Wolf
and Wolf gets blown out.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.843
Smells like
motive to me.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.111
Smells like
gumbo to me.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.512
LASALLE:
Wolf now works for a group

12:25.545 --> 12:26.780
called Shade Corp.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.115
Go find him.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.083
I'll save you some leftovers.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.119
Hey!
Hey, Laurel.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.286
Just in time.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.025
What do you think?
LAUREL:
Hey, what's in here?

12:38.058 --> 12:39.259
Like, cumin?

12:39.292 --> 12:41.962
"Like, cumin?"

12:41.995 --> 12:44.131
Mm-hmm.
Where did
I go wrong?

12:44.164 --> 12:45.866
It's filé.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.135
Your mother's gene pool got into

12:48.168 --> 12:49.837
your system and

12:49.870 --> 12:53.140
any traces of my DNA
strand were erased.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.574
Hey, I got your love for music,

12:54.607 --> 12:56.076
not your taste buds.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.912
Oh, Dad...
Hmm?

12:58.946 --> 13:01.048
...my RA says the piano's
taking up too much space.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.249
I have to move it
out of the dorm.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.184
Well, honey,
that piano's

13:04.217 --> 13:06.053
been in the
family for years.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.921
It's what you
learned on,

13:07.955 --> 13:09.222
it's what I
learned on...
Yeah...

13:09.256 --> 13:10.824
I know, I'm not gonna
get rid of it.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.260
I just want to
send it back.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.095
Your mom doesn't know
how to play.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.429
Well, I wasn't going
to send it to the house,

13:16.463 --> 13:17.430
I was going to send it here.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.232
This is where I work.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.936
And where you live.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.204
For now.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.076
Eat your gumbo.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.978
I'm gonna call
your RA.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.091
So how can you be sure
Wolf is actually here?

13:44.124 --> 13:45.625
It's a mercenary
hangout.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.560
I got a tip from one
of my buddies in Vice

13:47.594 --> 13:49.429
that Wolf's got a
side business going:

13:49.462 --> 13:52.199
guns, night vision
goggles, Kevlar...

13:54.234 --> 13:56.536
Kevlar might've
been a nice idea.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.039
Chrissy Lasalle?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.340
Hey.
Hi!

14:00.373 --> 14:02.175
When'd you move
to New Orleans?

14:02.209 --> 14:03.510
Happy to see you!

14:03.543 --> 14:05.478
I got into, uh,
law school at Tulane.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.080
So I take class at night,

14:07.114 --> 14:08.381
and I make some extra change
here during the day.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.317
Chrissy and I
go back to 'Bama,

14:10.350 --> 14:12.886
and I was a cheerleader

14:12.920 --> 14:14.387
and old Chrissy, here,
was Big Al.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.057
He's our mascot.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.225
An elephant.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.160
A very cute
elephant.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.394
Roll Tide.

14:21.428 --> 14:22.662
Roll Tide.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.198
Wow. School mascot?
Magnum Cum Laude?

14:25.232 --> 14:27.935
I feel like I'm meeting you
for the very first time.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.669
So, Heather...

14:29.702 --> 14:31.104
What you got?

14:31.138 --> 14:34.341
Did you see this guy
here last night?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.043
Oh, I sure did.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.678
Got into an argument
with another guy.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.148
LASALLE:
Him?
HEATHER:
Uh-huh.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.283
That's it. I don't know what
they were arguing about,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.518
but, um, you can ask
the first guy yourself.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.187
He's back there drinking
with his buddies.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.197
Max Wolf?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.499
You got a prescription for that?

14:59.532 --> 15:01.401
NCIS.
We need to talk.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.257
Ah! Ah!

15:31.364 --> 15:33.233
What are you,
some kind of superhero?

15:35.102 --> 15:37.070
You should see her
when she's angry.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.541
BRODY:
Cuban Kush. Rare,

15:41.574 --> 15:43.510
expensive,
illegal.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.712
It's for medicinal
purposes.
Then why'd you run?

15:45.745 --> 15:47.480
You ever think about
getting out of that suit?

15:47.514 --> 15:49.349
Shade Corp. could use
a soft touch like yours.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.252
BRODY:
I really appreciate
the offer, but...

15:52.285 --> 15:53.720
I'm more into guys who know

15:53.753 --> 15:56.323
that less is more.
Things like...

15:56.356 --> 15:58.225
protecting corrupt
governments

15:58.258 --> 16:00.327
moving weapons
for terrorists

16:00.360 --> 16:02.162
or killing
a Navy SEAL

16:02.195 --> 16:03.230
don't really
turn me on.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.333
Whoa, Blake?
You think I killed him?

16:06.366 --> 16:07.767
Go to hell.
You're already
pretty busy down there,

16:07.800 --> 16:09.202
I'll pass.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.737
So what was the fight all about?

16:10.770 --> 16:13.040
The mission in
Somalia, the girls

16:13.073 --> 16:15.142
in Morocco...
We fought 'cause
he's a damn hypocrite.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.045
The SEALs: brave,
upstanding, courageous--

16:18.078 --> 16:19.512
and their
poster child,

16:19.546 --> 16:21.148
a model of what a
SEAL should be...

16:21.181 --> 16:23.250
is dating a prostitute?
Excuse me?

16:23.283 --> 16:25.618
After Blake got me fired,
I did some digging.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.487
Found out who he
spends his nights
in town with.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.124
We fought 'cause I called
his girlfriend what she is:

16:31.158 --> 16:32.459
a whore.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.196
This girl?

16:36.229 --> 16:37.597
That's her.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.533
Natalie... someone.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.269
Two words:

16:42.302 --> 16:45.004
Hook. Er.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.412
She lied.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.825
PRIDE:
"Hooker" was a fact
she omitted.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.627
Yes, omitted.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.329
Forgot.
Failed to mention.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.797
There was absolutely
no speaking

17:10.830 --> 17:12.465
of the hooker part at all.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.833
The whole business about...

17:13.866 --> 17:15.302
Them meeting at a party?

17:15.335 --> 17:17.137
That was probably a lie as well.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.306
If Wolf was telling the truth.
Okay.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.807
Let's say, for a second, he was.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.142
Natalie is a college student...

17:22.175 --> 17:23.210
Who can afford a Wini.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.079
Uh, a Zini.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.414
Hmm?
A Zini.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.382
But you get the point
I'm trying to make.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.319
Being a prostitute
doesn't give us motive.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.786
Wolf alibi'd out.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.855
Street cam caught him at a bar

17:35.888 --> 17:38.225
at the time of Petty
Officer Blake's death.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.260
Since we found out
Natalie was a pro,

17:40.293 --> 17:41.528
I widened our search.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.396
She's got a juvie record

17:43.430 --> 17:45.398
under another name,
Natalie Burke.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.467
More
prostitution?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.402
No. Attempted murder?

17:49.436 --> 17:51.604
She tried to shoot
her stepfather.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.306
Court advocate
suspected abuse,

17:53.340 --> 17:54.641
nothing's
been proven.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.609
But... she knows guns.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.778
All right.
Bring her back.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.647
Tried her cell.
She's not answering.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.815
She didn't show up
for classes today.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.784
LASALLE:
Hang on.
I got a guy.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.319
Knows this world.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.587
Might be able to help.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.456
Talk to him. Brody...

18:09.489 --> 18:11.124
Back to the sorority?

18:11.158 --> 18:12.892
Uh, you seem
reluctant

18:12.925 --> 18:14.761
to want to pin all
this on Natalie.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.796
Is it weird
working a suspect

18:16.829 --> 18:19.366
kind of like
Laurel?
Not my first.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.501
Think that's clouding
my judgment in this case?

18:21.534 --> 18:23.803
Pride...

18:23.836 --> 18:25.472
Girl with a
checkered past,

18:25.505 --> 18:26.873
who lied,

18:26.906 --> 18:28.441
washed gun residue
off her hands

18:28.475 --> 18:31.644
and she was in a locked
room with the victim?

18:31.678 --> 18:33.680
A veritable bulls-eye of
circumstantial evidence.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.148
But...?

18:35.182 --> 18:37.150
Look, Brody...

18:37.184 --> 18:38.451
When your kid's little,

18:38.485 --> 18:40.287
you choose what they eat,
what they wear.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.921
You put 'em to bed at night
and kiss their forehead

18:41.954 --> 18:43.356
and it all is good.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.491
And then, poof--

18:44.524 --> 18:46.726
in an instant,

18:46.759 --> 18:50.430
they grow up,
they go to college...

18:50.463 --> 18:52.165
You lose control
of everything.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.433
Where they are,
what they're into.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.535
It's just scary
to think that somehow

18:55.568 --> 18:58.938
that could go as dark
as turning tricks and murder.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.940
Someone ever creates
a pill to keep 'em young,

19:00.973 --> 19:02.609
they'll make a mint.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.647
ROSS P.: ...but as soon as that
little chick opened her mouth,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.316
breath smelling like
the bottom of my feet,

19:09.349 --> 19:10.750
straight up,
it was...

19:10.783 --> 19:12.652
Oh, here go the man, right here.

19:12.685 --> 19:13.920
S'up, Peter Gunn?

19:13.953 --> 19:15.422
Ross P., tipster said

19:15.455 --> 19:16.823
you're selling
illegal firearms to kids.

19:16.856 --> 19:17.924
I don't know what
you talking about.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.559
That's a Federal offense

19:19.592 --> 19:21.194
and a personal pet peeve.
What are you doing, man?

19:21.228 --> 19:23.330
Come on, I got rights
and this is my bar, man.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.332
I got this.
Man, come on!

19:26.266 --> 19:28.201
You ain't got to get

19:28.235 --> 19:29.802
all method on me
now, Agent Lasalle.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.272
Gotta protect my confidential
informant's image.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.806
What you want?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.409
Name's Natalie.

19:36.443 --> 19:38.811
She's a working girl.
You seen her around?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.947
White girls all look
the same to me.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.482
Ross...

19:42.515 --> 19:44.251
the only reason
you're not in a cell

19:44.284 --> 19:45.952
on attempted murder charges
is 'cause I own you.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.987
Fine.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.657
Yeah.
Working girl.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.592
I mean, what's so
important about her?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.827
Think she killed a Navy SEAL.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.963
Navy SEAL?

19:56.996 --> 20:00.267
She is a bad little
white girl, huh?

20:00.300 --> 20:02.635
I'll ask around.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.004
Long as it gets
you off my back.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.274
Better eat your Wheaties.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.509
'Cause I'm gonna be on your back
for a long time.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.715
Natalie stayed
with me last night,

20:15.748 --> 20:17.950
but when I woke up this morning,
she was gone.

20:17.984 --> 20:21.288
Any idea where
we can find her?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.955
Uh, she usually has class
in the morning.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.925
I think... Soc 301.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.694
No, we checked.
She's not there.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.929
And then in the afternoon,
she goes to work.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.464
It says
in her file

20:31.498 --> 20:32.965
she's a tutor, right?

20:32.999 --> 20:34.267
Yeah.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.235
You, too?

20:37.337 --> 20:39.005
Yeah.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.507
It's a good way
to make money, you know?

20:40.540 --> 20:41.908
College is really expensive.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.643
Yeah, I...

20:43.676 --> 20:44.911
I know.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.616
You okay?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.318
Yeah, I'm just...

20:51.351 --> 20:53.119
I'm worried about Natalie.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.292
Um, I kind of have
to go to class.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.661
Just, um...

21:04.931 --> 21:05.932
You hear from Natalie,
you'll, uh...

21:05.965 --> 21:07.367
you'll let me know, right?

21:09.101 --> 21:10.370
I will.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.308
Officer Banton, does the campus
have crisis counselors?

21:15.342 --> 21:16.943
Someone Natalie
might confide in?

21:16.976 --> 21:18.411
That'd be C.A.P.S.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.612
That's Crisis

21:19.646 --> 21:21.414
and Psychological Services.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.450
I'll get you their contact
if you'd like.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.584
Yes, please.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.952
Hey, you wouldn't happen to be

21:25.985 --> 21:28.988
of the single girl variety,
would you?

21:29.021 --> 21:30.490
PRIDE:
Can I borrow you please?

21:30.523 --> 21:31.524
Yes!

21:35.995 --> 21:37.330
Tilda's shoes.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.332
$700, $800.

21:39.366 --> 21:40.500
Now why someone would
pay that for shoes?

21:40.533 --> 21:41.534
No idea.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.536
This purse?

21:43.570 --> 21:45.638
$1,500 to three grand.

21:50.410 --> 21:55.348
Maybe Natalie's not the only one
who's a prostitute.

21:55.382 --> 21:58.451
So, I scanned the girl's photo
through facial recognition.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.353
Then I applied it
to a web photo search.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.589
It's the same technology
social media sites use

22:02.622 --> 22:04.457
when they try to guess
who's standing behind you

22:04.491 --> 22:05.558
at your birthday party.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.394
And what I got...

22:07.427 --> 22:11.531
at first looked like
a bare-bones education site.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.132
But then...

22:13.165 --> 22:15.535
if I become a member...

22:15.568 --> 22:17.870
sign in...

22:17.904 --> 22:21.040
and voilà--
collegiate call girls.

22:21.073 --> 22:21.974
Who's he?

22:22.008 --> 22:22.842
That's Patton Plame.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.011
He just finished
the Fleet Cyber Command,

22:25.044 --> 22:26.546
and we scooped him up.

22:26.579 --> 22:27.380
He's a hacker.

22:27.414 --> 22:28.981
"Investigative Computer
Specialist"

22:29.015 --> 22:30.650
is what it says on my card.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.951
Please.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.052
You break through
bad guys' e-mails.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.086
That's a hacker.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.354
That's dope.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.725
"Dope" is a good thing.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.393
I know from dope, dear.

22:40.427 --> 22:41.728
Patton Plame.

22:41.761 --> 22:42.729
My daughter Laurel.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.464
Hi.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.566
So, collegiate
call girls.

22:46.599 --> 22:50.136
Sex is big business
in college.
Laurel...

22:50.169 --> 22:53.039
Web-cam girls,
girls who do phone stuff...
PRIDE: Laurel...

22:53.072 --> 22:55.041
I have this one friend
who, one time...
Laurel.

22:55.074 --> 22:58.144
If you would just
wait in the kitchen,

22:58.177 --> 22:59.712
that'd be dope.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.749
It was nice
to meet you, Patton.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.150
Someone talk.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.718
Ran Natalie's
bestie Tilda.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.587
She's an econ major
and was arrested

23:07.620 --> 23:09.756
for solicitation
two years ago in New York.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.691
You want me to bring in Vice,
round up the girls?

23:11.724 --> 23:13.860
Not until we solve the murder--
we need to find Natalie.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.762
Well, while you back there
trying to figure it out,

23:15.795 --> 23:18.631
I'm just gonna go on-line and
make an appointment with her.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.703
I came to see
about the piano.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.106
Dad, you forgot?

23:27.139 --> 23:30.743
No, I left a message
with your RA.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.845
Well, I have to
move it tomorrow.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.747
All right, well,
l-let me follow up.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.016
Or... I can
just put it here.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.751
There's plenty
of space.

23:38.785 --> 23:41.954
You don't put a house
piano in an NCIS office.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.723
Because it might not fit in

23:43.756 --> 23:45.592
with the crawfish boil
in the courtyard...?

23:45.625 --> 23:47.159
Laurel, if I move
the piano here,

23:47.193 --> 23:49.662
it's just one more thing
I have to move back home.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.099
Can we...?

23:53.132 --> 23:55.134
Talk more later?

23:55.167 --> 23:57.737
Yeah.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.174
I'm sorry...
It's fine.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.976
We got an appointment
with Natalie.

24:04.010 --> 24:07.547
We're studying algebra tonight,
Roosevelt Hotel, 9:00.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.222
BRODY:
Kind of piano is it?

24:18.525 --> 24:20.827
Sorry, I overheard you guys
talking in the kitchen.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.262
Upright Hamilton.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.131
It was my grandmother's.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.134
Well, it's no fun
to be caught in the middle.

24:28.167 --> 24:32.138
My parents did that to me
when they would silent fight.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.806
Walk around the house,
ignoring each other,

24:33.840 --> 24:35.141
and I was the go-between.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.175
How old were you?

24:36.208 --> 24:39.211
Oh, it's
still happening.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.080
LASALLE: Guys, I'm glad
you're having a moment,

24:41.113 --> 24:44.083
but do you think this hail Mary
of ours is gonna work?

24:44.116 --> 24:45.985
BRODY: Chrissy, do you have
a date with Heather?

24:46.018 --> 24:49.155
Heather,
the cheerleader?

24:49.188 --> 24:51.290
He was
the school mascot.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.526
A walrus.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.293
"Big Ed."

24:54.326 --> 24:56.262
It's "Big Al."

24:56.295 --> 24:57.530
And he's an elephant.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.606
PRIDE:
Let's go.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.541
She's here.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.314
Pride!

25:15.347 --> 25:16.783
Natalie, look out!

25:22.021 --> 25:23.756
They're gonna kill me.

25:23.790 --> 25:26.859
They're gonna kill me.
They're gonna kill me!

25:36.703 --> 25:39.772
BOLO's out on the SUV
that tried to run Natalie over,

25:39.806 --> 25:42.208
and NOPD is
checking street cams.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.309
Dark SUV, no license plate.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.578
I wouldn't count your chickens.

25:45.612 --> 25:46.846
What's going on in there?

25:46.879 --> 25:48.681
Chill and spill.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.250
Chill out over food,
spill what you know.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.019
Chill and spill.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.654
I like that.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.589
Sebastian's got something
on the bullet. Come on.

25:58.290 --> 26:02.294
You from a small family,
big family?

26:02.328 --> 26:04.096
It's just me
and my mom.

26:04.130 --> 26:09.168
Dad died in a Humvee accident
in Iraq when I was a kid.

26:09.201 --> 26:12.872
Mom re-married
this psycho alcoholic...

26:12.905 --> 26:15.608
blah, blah, blah...

26:15.642 --> 26:17.677
You're thinking,
"That's why she's so messed up."

26:17.710 --> 26:22.314
Actually, I'm thinking
you're pretty damn strong.

26:22.348 --> 26:26.118
Come out here,
get into college...

26:26.152 --> 26:28.320
You sound
just like TJ.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.089
Petty Officer Blake?

26:31.991 --> 26:33.660
He was just "TJ" to me.

26:33.693 --> 26:37.029
First name basis.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.330
Must have been
a good client.

26:38.364 --> 26:41.033
He wasn't a john.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.334
We met in a park.

26:42.368 --> 26:45.304
I was studying,

26:45.337 --> 26:46.305
and he walked by...

26:46.338 --> 26:49.241
in his uniform.

26:53.312 --> 26:56.048
He reminded me a lot of my dad.

26:56.082 --> 27:00.252
Not because of the
military, but because...

27:00.286 --> 27:03.990
he was just a good guy.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.929
Why didn't you tell us
about your relationship before?

27:09.962 --> 27:12.098
Nobody knew.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.802
Girls in the ring are warned not
to get serious with guys.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.705
So, he knew what you did?

27:18.738 --> 27:22.709
He wanted me to quit.

27:22.742 --> 27:25.778
But when I bailed on this
appointment I got a text,

27:25.812 --> 27:28.147
warning me that if
I ever did it again,

27:28.180 --> 27:29.448
something bad
would happen.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.684
Text from who?

27:31.718 --> 27:33.019
I don't know.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.154
The hierarchy of the service,

27:35.187 --> 27:37.189
it's like this big secret.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.427
But you showed up tonight...

27:41.460 --> 27:43.429
because you were scared of
whoever it was.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.899
Yeah.

27:49.736 --> 27:52.739
Were you supposed to be working?

27:52.772 --> 27:54.741
The night that TJ was killed.

27:57.810 --> 28:01.247
I was, like

28:01.280 --> 28:04.717
I mean, like TJ said,
they don't control me.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.753
But they do.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.826
He believed in me.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.930
And they murdered him

28:17.964 --> 28:20.466
because he was trying
to help me change my life.

28:22.134 --> 28:25.304
Hey, Pride.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.439
Are you sure Natalie doesn't
know who's running this ring?

28:27.473 --> 28:29.108
Swears she doesn't.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.743
Ugly business.

28:30.777 --> 28:33.980
Luring these girls with money
and the high life.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.514
Scaring them when
they want to get out.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.449
Anything from
Natalie's cell phone?

28:37.483 --> 28:41.053
No, all the threatening texts
are from burners.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.389
You staying on the right
side of the line?

28:43.422 --> 28:46.759
Man, it's been three years
since I've been in a casino.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.828
This was a bet
I stopped myself from making.

28:48.861 --> 28:52.164
Hey, I put a trace
on the other girls' phones.

28:52.198 --> 28:55.034
Odds are--
whoever's running this ring

28:55.067 --> 28:56.402
killed Petty Officer Blake.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.071
Good man.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.473
Day by day, baby.
Day by day.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.010
SEBASTIAN: Ballistic
fingerprinting began

29:04.043 --> 29:06.212
when scientist Alexandre
Lacassagne matched

29:06.245 --> 29:08.480
an individual bullet to
the inside of a gun barrel.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.482
He realized that the
imperfections inside

29:10.516 --> 29:12.151
made every gun
unique and special.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.986
Not unlike the imperfections
of a snowflake.

29:14.020 --> 29:17.189
Or a toddler with a large nose
whose mother still loves him.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.193
Right. Moving on.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.062
This is the bullet
that Dr. Wade removed

29:23.095 --> 29:24.330
from Petty Officer Blake.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.799
These are the striations
of said bullet.

29:26.833 --> 29:30.502
And this is removed from the vic
of an unsolved murder in 2006.

29:30.536 --> 29:33.873
Now, wait for it...

29:33.906 --> 29:35.107
Wait for it.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.544
Just changed the batt...

29:38.577 --> 29:40.279
Here! The striations match.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.581
The same gun was used
for both murders.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.050
Who was the vic in 2006?

29:44.083 --> 29:45.451
Uh, some promoter
at Club Madison.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.019
LASALLE:
I remember that case.

29:47.053 --> 29:49.588
No arrests, but rumor was
Russian Mob did it.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.224
Prostitution's a big business
for Russian syndicates.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.526
Since New Orleans is a port
city, it's easy for them

29:54.560 --> 29:57.096
to move girls in
from all over the world.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.831
Sebastian, can we
cross-reference...

29:58.865 --> 30:00.066
The prints from the club murder
with those

30:00.099 --> 30:01.600
from the secret tunnel door?
You got it.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.470
Meanwhile, I'm going
to my "phone-a-friend."

30:10.609 --> 30:12.311
You wanted Russians,

30:12.344 --> 30:14.046
should have just said something
a couple of days ago.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.115
Didn't know it was Russians
a couple of days ago.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.919
Inefficient is
all I'm saying.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.088
His name's Vlad.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.990
He's Mob connected, you know.

30:24.023 --> 30:27.159
H-He thinks he's here to talk
to me about... other matters.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.995
And he crazy.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.897
And I'm talking psycho crazy.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.899
You hear me?

30:39.038 --> 30:40.572
Hey, frat-boy.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.541
I'm meeting someone.

30:44.076 --> 30:46.045
NCIS. Federal agent.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.080
What is this?

30:50.216 --> 30:52.318
Dead Navy SEAL.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.353
One of your business
associates murdered him

30:54.386 --> 30:55.654
for taking one of their girls.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.024
I'm legit
business man.

30:58.057 --> 31:00.359
Sorry, can't help you.

31:00.392 --> 31:04.663
I heard you're more mobbed up
than a sanitation chief.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.532
Well, someone's got a big mouth.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.235
You can shut yours.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.206
Put the gun down, Vlad.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.676
Your smile only masks
your fear.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.678
I'm genuinely having a blast.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.647
Tell the man what you know.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.086
Told you he was crazy.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.089
That better be licensed.

31:34.093 --> 31:36.395
So let me tell you a story.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.664
Once upon a time,
there was a rich businessman

31:38.697 --> 31:41.000
that had Russian mob ties,

31:41.033 --> 31:42.969
and he made
an appointment with...

31:43.002 --> 31:45.504
Natalie.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.206
Had the time of his life.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.142
Even fell in love, but...

31:50.176 --> 31:52.311
When rich guy tries
to make another appointment,

31:52.344 --> 31:53.980
he's told
she's no longer available,

31:54.013 --> 31:55.681
because she's fallen in love...

31:55.714 --> 31:57.649
With Petty Officer Blake.

31:57.683 --> 32:01.487
So, mob wants to keep
a good customer happy,

32:01.520 --> 32:02.989
kills Blake.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.991
Do we believe this Vlad guy?

32:05.024 --> 32:06.993
He had a gun pointed
to his head.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.627
All right.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.997
If someone was willing
to kill for this guy,

32:11.030 --> 32:13.032
he must be someone important.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.400
Let's get Natalie
to give us a description.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.636
Maybe-maybe Patton can work up
a good 3-D sketch.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.506
Sebastian.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.076
You okay, kid?

32:24.110 --> 32:25.177
No, he's not.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.678
He's on sugar overload.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.247
I'm on a saccharide rush,
glucose gloat,

32:28.280 --> 32:29.481
fructose frenzy.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.017
Because...

32:31.050 --> 32:34.020
Uh, well, I...
we wanted to figure out

32:34.053 --> 32:35.521
how the killer made
his improvised silencer,

32:35.554 --> 32:37.556
and we did. We did!

32:39.625 --> 32:42.428
Sebastian?

32:42.461 --> 32:44.396
This is a gun.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.665
This is Orange Hays Soda.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.267
You take three empty bottles,

32:48.300 --> 32:50.636
cut two of them up,
stick them inside the third,

32:50.669 --> 32:53.005
Then stuff it with, uh,
Styrofoam or cotton.

32:53.039 --> 32:54.506
Bam.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.008
Okay, calm.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.743
Only there is no bam.

32:57.776 --> 33:01.347
This contraption cancels most
of the noise from the gun.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.315
And that's why Natalie
didn't hear the shot.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.184
How do we know
it's Orange Hays?

33:05.217 --> 33:07.286
I found residue
on the plastic fragments

33:07.319 --> 33:09.688
from Petty Officer Blake's
chest wound,

33:09.721 --> 33:12.158
and Sebastian matched
the residue

33:12.191 --> 33:14.360
with the formula
that makes the drink.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.195
I also downed, like,
three liters of it.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.230
I have to pee.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.733
You know who else drinks
Orange Hays?

33:21.767 --> 33:23.502
Who?

33:32.411 --> 33:35.013
Outside, please, ma'am.

33:41.420 --> 33:42.388
Hostage!

33:46.392 --> 33:49.095
He's in the hallway!

33:49.128 --> 33:51.230
Officer Banton, stop!

34:02.774 --> 34:04.776
999, shots fired.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.758
Give me an excuse.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.735
I don't know how you drink
this stuff.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.538
Sweet, caloric,

35:06.572 --> 35:07.506
sticky.

35:07.539 --> 35:10.209
You should've rinsed the bottle
a little more

35:10.242 --> 35:11.710
before you made
your ghetto-rigged silencer.

35:13.179 --> 35:15.481
PRIDE: You remember
Petty Officer Blake?

35:15.514 --> 35:17.749
Never met him.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.685
Your gun has.

35:19.718 --> 35:20.786
BRODY:
Your gun met him,

35:20.819 --> 35:24.523
too, June of 2006.

35:24.556 --> 35:25.791
Club madison.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.226
Doesn't mean I pulled
the trigger.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.860
You work for the
Russians, Banton.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.696
You killed Blake

35:30.729 --> 35:32.231
'cause he got in the way
of business.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.233
When we started
sussing out the ring,

35:34.266 --> 35:35.501
you tried to kill Natalie.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.703
You knew we were getting close,
so you tried to run her over.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.605
PRIDE:
This isn't a game, Banton.

35:39.638 --> 35:40.872
We got you.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.242
We got you on two murders

35:43.275 --> 35:45.877
and an attempt.
Louisiana's
a capital murder state.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.779
You want to see old age?

35:47.813 --> 35:49.448
Talk.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.886
Let's start with this.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.922
I didn't try to run
that girl over.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.291
I don't miss.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.795
So who was the driver?

36:03.829 --> 36:05.764
And this is where I get
my lawyer,

36:05.797 --> 36:07.799
and we play Let's Make A Deal.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.804
We have to leave. Now!

36:12.838 --> 36:15.541
Officer Banton was arrested.
He's been working with the mob.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.776
He's the one who killed T.J.
Look, Natalie, slow down.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.811
If the cops start
piecing together everything,

36:19.845 --> 36:21.513
they're gonna figure out
who runs the ring,

36:21.547 --> 36:22.614
and those guys are going
to kill us.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.783
Natalie, listen to me.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.485
Ow. Ow, let go of me.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.853
Aah!
Who have you been talking to?

36:27.886 --> 36:29.455
What?

36:29.488 --> 36:31.457
I need to know
what you've been saying

36:31.490 --> 36:32.791
and to whom you've said it.

36:34.393 --> 36:36.395
I need to know, Natalie.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.397
It's you.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.732
You run the ring.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.634
You told that guy to kill Blake.

36:42.668 --> 36:43.902
Ow!

36:43.935 --> 36:45.771
You were coveted

36:45.804 --> 36:47.473
by a very important man.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.775
A man that I need to keep happy.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.710
So, now for both of our sakes,

36:51.743 --> 36:52.944
I need you

36:52.978 --> 36:54.613
to tell me

36:54.646 --> 36:57.783
that you didn't tell
anybody anything.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.320
I didn't.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.889
You just did.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.524
PRIDE:
NCIS.

37:07.626 --> 37:10.028
You stupid bitch.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.397
Hands on your head.

37:11.430 --> 37:14.266
Nothing stupid about her.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.739
Let's go.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.908
I don't want you
to mess up your Zini.

37:24.976 --> 37:26.978
What's a Zini?

37:32.951 --> 37:34.853
Take care of those boys.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.488
Thank you, sir.
If you need anything,

37:36.522 --> 37:37.656
you let us know.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.291
Appreciate it.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.534
T.J. saw the good in me.

37:48.567 --> 37:51.036
He thought I deserved better,

37:51.069 --> 37:55.341
that I was strong enough
to start over and move on.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.942
He's not the only one who did.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.043
After we found out your father

37:58.076 --> 37:59.845
was U.S. Army,
we made a few calls.

37:59.878 --> 38:03.749
LASALLE: Scholarship from
the Folds of Honor Foundation.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.917
All you got to do
is pick a school.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.554
Thank you

38:08.587 --> 38:11.056
for giving me a second chance.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.804
Awfully humid out here
for a piano.

38:25.837 --> 38:27.373
Only temporary.

38:27.406 --> 38:29.975
The movers are making room
for it inside.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.912
But... what about home?

38:33.945 --> 38:35.714
That's my issue, not yours.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.849
Gonna do everything I can
to make sure

38:37.883 --> 38:40.852
you don't get caught
in the middle.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.655
The only middle here...

38:44.956 --> 38:46.925
...is middle C.

38:48.494 --> 38:49.828
Name your tune.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.499
:
Okay.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.972
(playing
"God Bless the Child")

39:01.006 --> 39:03.008
First song you ever taught me.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.880
It's better as a duet.
