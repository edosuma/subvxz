the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.609 --> 00:13.239

00:34.685 --> 00:37.961
I can't do this to him.

00:37.961 --> 00:40.109
He's my friend.

00:40.963 --> 00:42.070
I have to call you back.

00:42.070 --> 00:46.177
I know this is your big night,
but these need to be proofed.

00:55.113 --> 00:56.976
Go.

01:07.669 --> 01:09.787
You're just leaving now?

01:10.171 --> 01:12.566
Don't even bother, D.

01:15.253 --> 01:17.041
Thank you.

01:17.041 --> 01:19.037
Thank you very much.

01:23.429 --> 01:29.457
Next up, I'm personally proud to introduce,
straight out of Brooklyn,

01:29.457 --> 01:33.432
give it up for miss Kira Danforth.

01:39.860 --> 01:44.196
The following is, as they say...

01:44.196 --> 01:46.724
A true story.

01:48.138 --> 01:53.075
I'm so glad you came tonight.
That meant a lot to me.

01:53.075 --> 01:55.858
You know what I'm saying?
I'm like airing my dirty laundry...

01:55.858 --> 01:59.938
You. You have a great novel in you.

01:59.938 --> 02:01.648
And I want it.

02:01.648 --> 02:03.835
Lionel says it's not a novel yet.

02:03.835 --> 02:07.028
Lionel's not an agent.
I am.

02:07.028 --> 02:09.607
Come on. First drink is on me.

02:09.607 --> 02:12.976
I have to read the whole book.
I mean, I can't believe...

02:12.976 --> 02:14.126
Yo, Kira, what's this?

02:14.126 --> 02:18.148
Ho, ho, ho, hey, hey, hey.
Hands off the lady.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.606
Shall we?

02:26.258 --> 02:27.992
You know him?

02:30.593 --> 02:36.244
He couldn't make a sentence stand up
and be noticed if he put viagra in the ink.

02:36.244 --> 02:37.878
Dear. Ah.

02:37.878 --> 02:39.677
Thank you.

02:39.677 --> 02:44.738
Hello. Kira, where are you?

02:44.738 --> 02:48.716
Kira, he's very bad news.
Get out.

02:48.716 --> 02:51.945
Just come join us
as soon as you can.

02:51.945 --> 02:54.110
Really?

02:57.882 --> 03:00.763
That's not real either!

03:57.790 --> 04:00.198
Victim's Kira Danforth.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.456
Lot of good these locks did.

04:02.456 --> 04:04.371
Looks like a push-in.

04:04.371 --> 04:08.828
Ah, but what do I know,
after working only 50 homicides?

04:08.828 --> 04:10.840
You mind telling me
why major case is slumming?

04:10.840 --> 04:14.653
Victim worked for Ariana Cypher
of Cypher press.

04:14.653 --> 04:17.007
Oh. Took her for a college grad.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.975
What with all the books,
milk crate furniture.

04:19.975 --> 04:21.576
Oh, found this...

04:21.576 --> 04:24.461
Here near the, uh, kitchenette.

04:24.461 --> 04:27.386
Saturday night special.
Older than the victim.

04:27.386 --> 04:32.208
Small caliber.
Poor girl bled to death.

04:32.208 --> 04:35.105
Looks like she's got
synthetic hair extensions.

04:35.105 --> 04:38.115
They've been singed.
This hand's burned.

04:38.115 --> 04:42.202
- Looks like coils.
- Stove's electric.

04:46.114 --> 04:48.171
So...

04:48.941 --> 04:52.049
They tried to, uh,

04:52.049 --> 04:54.495
shove her head into the burner.

04:54.495 --> 04:58.034
She blocks it with her left hand.

05:01.310 --> 05:03.450
Burns her hand and her hair too.

05:03.450 --> 05:05.245
Whoever did this,
they were looking for something.

05:05.245 --> 05:07.648
They wanted her to talk.

05:27.512 --> 05:30.585
Well, they might have found
what they were looking for.

05:30.914 --> 05:35.457
I got bright Green resin,
crystallized.

05:35.457 --> 05:38.418
And they say cops have the best pot.

05:38.418 --> 05:40.748
East Flatbush kid.

05:40.748 --> 05:44.686
Selling high-end weed
to her midtown colleagues.

05:44.686 --> 05:46.794
You know, you could
store a fortune in here.

05:46.794 --> 05:49.648
A single female... easy target.

05:49.648 --> 05:55.869
She might not be single.
Scarface DVD. Men's hoodies.

05:55.869 --> 05:57.676
Where's her boyfriend?

05:57.676 --> 05:59.975
Somebody outside wants a word.

05:59.975 --> 06:02.122
- Family?
- Don't know.

06:02.122 --> 06:05.724
But you're major case.
You tell me.

06:10.009 --> 06:13.389
Kira may have come from here,
but she was going places.

06:13.389 --> 06:15.683
What did Kira do for you, Miss Cypher?

06:15.683 --> 06:19.068
Everything.
She was devoted, brilliant.

06:19.068 --> 06:22.420
No matter how early I got in,
she was always there first.

06:22.420 --> 06:25.551
Right. When she didn't show this morning,
you came here?

06:25.551 --> 06:30.444
No. I sent my other assistant, Paige.
She called 911.

06:30.444 --> 06:32.641
Feel free to ask her anything.

06:32.641 --> 06:35.737
I want the killer caught.
You'll handle this, yes?

06:35.737 --> 06:39.160
- We'll do our very best.
- I'm late.

06:41.578 --> 06:45.212
I can't believe it. Just last night,
Kira was on top of the world.

06:45.212 --> 06:46.086
You were with her.

06:46.086 --> 06:48.104
At a short story reading
in the East Village.

06:48.104 --> 06:50.987
I had no idea she lived here.

06:50.987 --> 06:53.692
Kira kept a lot close to the vest.

06:53.692 --> 06:55.561
Like selling pot at work?

06:55.561 --> 06:57.866
Kira? Never.

06:57.866 --> 06:59.744
Where'd you get that idea?

06:59.744 --> 07:01.563
She ever mention a boyfriend?

07:01.563 --> 07:02.675
No.

07:02.675 --> 07:08.325
But, uh, last month, coming back from lunch,
we ran into a friend of hers on his bike.

07:08.325 --> 07:11.748
She didn't introduce us,
so I did it myself.

07:11.748 --> 07:14.698
His name was D tour.

07:14.698 --> 07:18.888
Baggy jeans,
oversized hoodie? / Yeah.

07:18.888 --> 07:20.818
He was...

07:21.761 --> 07:25.582
He was really... black.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.597
Really black.
You mean obsidian?

07:28.597 --> 07:33.751
No. I mean not like Kira, you know?
Street.

07:33.751 --> 07:36.850
Said he was an animator
for a studio in Red hook,

07:36.850 --> 07:40.739
but he looked like a messenger.

07:43.650 --> 07:47.747
His real name...
Uh, we just call him D tour.

07:47.747 --> 07:50.646
He runs errands, makes deliveries.

07:50.646 --> 07:52.561
Uh, out sick today.

07:52.561 --> 07:54.950
He told people he was an animator.

07:54.950 --> 07:56.633
I told him he could work his way up.

07:56.633 --> 07:59.512
But he's always strolling in late.

07:59.768 --> 08:03.064
He's not exactly employee of the month,
why keep him around?

08:03.064 --> 08:05.806
We like him.
He's a fun guy.

08:05.806 --> 08:07.998
And it's a fun place to work.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.654
You got all this stuff.

08:09.654 --> 08:14.497
You got pinball machines
and ping-pong.

08:19.546 --> 08:22.260
You got roaches.

08:26.022 --> 08:28.603
Is that why you keep D tour around,
'cause he gets the good stuff?

08:28.603 --> 08:31.013
Your dial-a-weed pal's
a murder suspect.

08:31.013 --> 08:33.594
Where does he live?

08:35.693 --> 08:40.288
All I have is a...
pager number.

08:46.973 --> 08:50.617
Hey, yo, D.
What the deal, baby?

09:03.535 --> 09:06.033
How did this happen to my daughter?

09:06.033 --> 09:09.141
We're looking for a man
Kira was involved with.

09:09.141 --> 09:12.191
Goes by the name D tour.

09:12.191 --> 09:13.612
This means nothing to me.

09:13.612 --> 09:16.463
They mean Dante, mama.

09:16.463 --> 09:20.825
Dante Heath...
is my sister's high school boyfriend.

09:20.825 --> 09:23.501
- He lived nearby.
- In the projects.

09:23.501 --> 09:25.737
My Kira was raised in a home,

09:25.737 --> 09:28.765
one I worked three jobs to buy.

09:28.765 --> 09:31.290
Is that how you paid
for her education?

09:31.290 --> 09:34.996
She won scholarships
to Kingsley, Bryn Mawr.

09:34.996 --> 09:37.640
My Kira was chosen.

09:37.640 --> 09:43.126
She had nothing to do
with that troublemaker for years.

09:46.308 --> 09:48.890
You don't share your mother's feelings?

09:48.890 --> 09:51.068
Kira loved that fool.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.454
- She took care of him.
- And you didn't tell me?

09:53.454 --> 09:56.586
- D tour wouldn't hurt her.
- Chayne!

09:56.813 --> 09:58.753
He have a history?

09:58.753 --> 10:01.269
Violence, drugs?

10:01.269 --> 10:03.356
Sells a little ganja.

10:03.356 --> 10:07.008
You know, with his bike and cartoons,
he's too much a kid to get into real trouble.

10:07.008 --> 10:10.309
This is as real as it gets, Chayne.

10:11.318 --> 10:13.987
But D tour must know that by now.

10:13.987 --> 10:15.670
He's on the run.
He's scared.

10:15.670 --> 10:19.102
I suppose he'd go where
any kid would... Home.

10:19.102 --> 10:23.401
To his mother.
If you can call her that.

10:25.096 --> 10:29.712
Dante crashes with his mom
in the same project he grew up in.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.642
Kira has a degree from Bryn Mawr.

10:31.642 --> 10:34.941
Why come back here... for him?

10:46.874 --> 10:48.868
What are y'all looking at?

10:48.868 --> 10:51.681
What the hell are y'all looking at?

10:54.244 --> 10:57.937
No, what happened to me was payback
for stealing someone's stash.

10:57.937 --> 11:00.138
You robbed somebody.

11:00.138 --> 11:02.628
I was making a pickup
when I heard shots.

11:02.628 --> 11:05.724
I saw my connection
and some fool both dead,

11:05.724 --> 11:09.054
all this weed on the table,
nobody around.

11:09.054 --> 11:12.417
But somebody made you.
Who?

11:12.417 --> 11:14.802
Before they killed Kira, they tortured her.

11:14.802 --> 11:16.524
Why would you protect them?

11:16.524 --> 11:19.163
I hope they rot in hell.
But they didn't kill Kira.

11:19.163 --> 11:22.606
- How do you know that?
- 'cause she left me a message.

11:22.606 --> 11:25.158
Said they roughed her up.

11:25.158 --> 11:29.283
Message is still there.
You can check it your damn self.

11:30.213 --> 11:32.278
What happened?

11:32.515 --> 11:35.867
She dump you, you got jealous?

11:35.867 --> 11:38.514
I knew I lost her at that reading.

11:38.514 --> 11:41.830
I saw the way... the way
he was touching her, speaking for her.

11:41.830 --> 11:43.013
Who's he?

11:43.013 --> 11:46.025
Some white guy.
Losin' his hair.

11:46.025 --> 11:51.315
I was mad, so...
I just hooked up with some hood rat.

11:52.864 --> 11:57.088
D tour and a rebound date
were at Roscoe's till 3:00.

11:57.088 --> 12:00.425
Kira's burns preceded the death
by a few hours.

12:00.425 --> 12:05.333
Looks like this torture and murder
might have been two separate events.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.250
Or D tour's friends could have been
laying in wait for him the whole night.

12:08.250 --> 12:11.023
We think they recovered
their pot and cut out.

12:11.023 --> 12:14.546
Kira left D tour this message at 11:00.

12:14.546 --> 12:16.567
They came for your stash.

12:16.567 --> 12:20.107
The place is a mess, and so am I.
It's over, D.

12:20.107 --> 12:24.977
Kira made two other cell calls Thursday night
to the Pantheon restaurant.

12:24.977 --> 12:27.669
The Pantheon... bright lights, big city.

12:27.669 --> 12:31.485
Looks like Kira was
juggling two worlds.

12:31.485 --> 12:35.246
And this was the night that they
both came crashing down on her.

12:35.246 --> 12:38.725
Receding hairline?
That's every other editor in New York.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.936
You didn't leave the reading with Kira?

12:40.936 --> 12:42.136
I had homework.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.991
And she was being mobbed;
editors, agents.

12:44.991 --> 12:47.232
Only TJ was getting more attention.

12:47.232 --> 12:49.162
TJ... Hawkins?

12:49.162 --> 12:52.247
He wrote that memoir about his time
in a Yemen prison?

12:52.247 --> 12:55.273
Throat full of glass.
Best-seller.

12:55.273 --> 12:58.397
He and Kira are
in Lionel's salon together.

12:58.397 --> 13:00.982
- Lionel...
- Lionel Shill.

13:00.982 --> 13:02.240
He's still writing?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.662
He's legendary now.
As a teacher.

13:04.662 --> 13:07.732
Guiding new writers like Kira and TJ.

13:07.732 --> 13:09.854
It's a token.

13:11.664 --> 13:16.723
I get it. She's the only
African-American in these photos.

13:16.723 --> 13:19.779
She had a sense of humor about it.

13:20.105 --> 13:21.810
Right.

13:22.728 --> 13:25.323
"American delinquent," Hawkins.

13:25.323 --> 13:28.093
- It's his new book?
- Mm-hmm.

13:28.563 --> 13:31.421
"to my girl Kira. Love, TJ."

13:31.421 --> 13:32.919
TJ and Kira were lovers?

13:32.919 --> 13:34.943
No. Like siblings.

13:34.943 --> 13:36.545
And Lionel's pets.

13:36.545 --> 13:42.915
In fact, Lionel invited TJ to a special dinner
at the Pantheon later that night.

13:43.506 --> 13:46.996
And TJ invited Kira?

13:46.996 --> 13:48.813
He did.

13:49.555 --> 13:51.667
You liked "Throat full"?

13:52.089 --> 13:53.667
- There you go.
- Thanks.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.551
Have a good one.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.231
You two aren't here for autographs.

13:58.231 --> 13:59.524
No.

13:59.524 --> 14:02.304
But I read your last one,
"Throat full of glass."

14:02.304 --> 14:04.713
- It was intense.
- Try living it.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.504
You always write about your life?

14:06.504 --> 14:09.564
It's a way for me
to exorcise my demons.

14:09.564 --> 14:12.268
Done things I shouldn't have.

14:12.744 --> 14:16.394
That include last Thursday night?

14:21.372 --> 14:25.008
Okay. I gotcha.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.257
Think I did it? Huh?

14:29.484 --> 14:32.610
Because of what... my past?

14:32.610 --> 14:35.925
You need to take it easy, TJ.

14:41.125 --> 14:44.417
Is that your idea of taking it easy?

14:47.601 --> 14:50.888
A lawyer? Naw, I can handle you two.

14:50.888 --> 14:53.287
Then sit down and answer the question.

14:53.287 --> 14:55.701
Where were you
Thursday at 2:00 AM?

14:55.701 --> 14:57.562
With Lionel Shill.

14:57.562 --> 14:59.079
Call him.

14:59.079 --> 15:03.178
Or don't. Just throw me in Rikers.
I don't care.

15:04.045 --> 15:06.399
Uh, hold that thought.

15:11.029 --> 15:12.262
He's a piece of work.

15:12.262 --> 15:16.751
Yeah, paparazzi's swarming outside.
TJ did this for the publicity.

15:16.751 --> 15:18.722
And he got it.

15:18.722 --> 15:21.183
You made Youlenz.

15:21.183 --> 15:25.514
The ADA says it's performance art,
not assault.

15:25.514 --> 15:29.955
If Shill confirms his alibi,
we'll have to street him.

15:32.174 --> 15:37.639
I first met TJ about five years ago
at a Narconon meeting.

15:37.639 --> 15:39.367
Researching a new book?

15:39.367 --> 15:40.915
Yes.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.033
TJ was the real thing.

15:44.033 --> 15:47.149
Oh, the stories he told.
Once he was...

15:47.149 --> 15:50.002
So you invited him into your salon.

15:50.002 --> 15:53.011
I told him that writing
could be his salvation,

15:53.011 --> 15:55.657
and, ah, today he's an author.

15:55.657 --> 16:00.150
So you invited him to the Pantheon.
Was that to impress anyone?

16:00.150 --> 16:01.658
Au contraire.

16:01.658 --> 16:04.748
I knew he'd be delighted
to meet my dear friend Phillip Green

16:04.748 --> 16:06.462
who just won the Nobel.

16:06.462 --> 16:09.438
TJ showed up about 9:00.

16:09.438 --> 16:11.655
After dinner, we retired here.

16:11.655 --> 16:13.131
I wish you wouldn't.

16:13.131 --> 16:15.768
Those were gifts to me
from Paul Bowles!

16:15.768 --> 16:19.344
TJ invited Kira too.
Did she come?

16:19.344 --> 16:21.008
No, she called.

16:21.008 --> 16:24.999
She was with Gareth Sage.
Snake of a man.

16:24.999 --> 16:26.792
A snake.

16:26.792 --> 16:28.527
So he's an agent.

16:28.527 --> 16:31.970
Yes, he doesn't handle
many women clients today.

16:31.970 --> 16:36.608
Perhaps because of the way he...
handled them.

16:37.270 --> 16:42.306
Kira called you again at 11:00.
Did she mention Sage?

16:42.559 --> 16:47.143
I couldn't make out a word.
She was very upset.

16:47.143 --> 16:51.090
I told her to call 911.

16:51.090 --> 16:54.562
Here's "White flight, black hate".

16:55.770 --> 16:59.584
It's about a young man who
shoots a cop in the Newark riots.

16:59.584 --> 17:01.445
I read this when I was in college.

17:01.445 --> 17:05.292
I taught that young man to read
while he was in prison.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.617
He died of AIDS.

17:07.617 --> 17:10.229
I'd show you my new one
that's due out in a month,

17:10.229 --> 17:12.483
but my publisher would kill me.

17:12.483 --> 17:15.192
But you may keep that one.
I'm happy to sign it for you.

17:15.192 --> 17:16.809
Not necessary. It's...

17:16.809 --> 17:20.780
- But we will take Sage's number.
- Okay.

17:24.397 --> 17:26.892
Go ahead.

17:30.213 --> 17:32.112
No, no, Tom...

17:32.112 --> 17:34.871
The detectives aren't staying.

17:34.871 --> 17:37.541
You know what? I'll have one of those.
Thanks. Thank you.

17:37.541 --> 17:39.272
Hey!

17:39.570 --> 17:41.289
And call the Today Show.

17:41.289 --> 17:44.682
Tell them if they don't take my call,
I'm gonna go right to Zucker.

17:44.682 --> 17:47.169
Okay. I liked her reading.

17:47.169 --> 17:52.465
We went to a bar, Thor,
and... we discussed her future.

17:52.465 --> 17:54.277
Did you give Kira a lift home?

17:54.277 --> 17:59.249
No. I went back to the wife
and the brat in Glen Cove.

17:59.249 --> 18:01.951
All right, after your drink with Kira,

18:01.951 --> 18:03.782
she called a friend.
She was very upset.

18:03.782 --> 18:06.498
- You have any idea why?
- I can't imagine.

18:06.498 --> 18:08.690
I'd just told her I was
gonna handle her novel.

18:08.690 --> 18:11.401
Well, we heard you don't
represent women.

18:11.953 --> 18:16.481
Oh, I see... Lionel Shill.

18:16.481 --> 18:18.412
Jerking you and me around.

18:18.412 --> 18:22.637
- Well, you can ignore him.
- Mr. Sage, Today Show on one.

18:24.273 --> 18:26.449
Hi. Yeah.

18:26.449 --> 18:29.744
Look. TJ was terrific on Leno last year.

18:29.744 --> 18:32.018
Why are you making me work so hard, huh?

18:32.018 --> 18:35.512
Tom, Tom, would you please
show the detectives out?

18:35.512 --> 18:39.767
Yeah. Well, this book is a lot better.
Let me tell you.

18:39.767 --> 18:42.030
- Thank you, Tom.
- You're welcome.

18:42.030 --> 18:46.812
I found Gareth Sage stories all over
a message board devoted to bad bosses.

18:46.812 --> 18:48.347
You just happened to be looking there.

18:48.347 --> 18:53.298
He forced a woman to lick up coffee
she spilled on his desk.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.481
He's a successful, powerful agent,
and he's hard on his assistants.

18:56.481 --> 18:58.197
You need a message board for that?

18:58.197 --> 19:01.891
At least three women have charged him
with sexual harassment.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.677
- But there's no record of assault.
- No.

19:03.677 --> 19:07.073
Because Sage always settles out of court.

19:07.364 --> 19:08.568
Where's your partner?

19:08.568 --> 19:12.621
He's on a reading binge.
Hawkins, Shill.

19:12.850 --> 19:16.157
Sage is gonna lawyer up the next time
you and Goren go to see him.

19:16.157 --> 19:20.133
Before you do, see if
any of these women will talk.

19:20.357 --> 19:23.914
I won this lit prize at Columbia.

19:23.914 --> 19:26.856
There was a ceremony. I read.

19:26.856 --> 19:31.190
Gareth was there.
Took me out for a drink.

19:31.190 --> 19:34.164
I told him I had a novel at home.

19:34.164 --> 19:36.074
And he asked to read it.

19:36.074 --> 19:38.762
He gave me a ride in his Jaguar.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.308
And that's when he harassed you.

19:41.308 --> 19:44.111
I tried to fight him off,
but he overpowered me.

19:44.111 --> 19:45.886
But you fought him in court.

19:45.886 --> 19:47.545
And lost.

19:47.545 --> 19:49.773
I got a little hush money, but...

19:49.773 --> 19:52.621
He said he'd bury me.

19:52.621 --> 19:56.183
It's not exactly the future
you hoped for?

19:56.183 --> 19:59.470
Sharks like Gareth Sage...

19:59.724 --> 20:02.344
They don't pay for their sins.

20:04.034 --> 20:06.149
This is Sage and his wife.

20:06.149 --> 20:09.399
But it turns out he has another type.

20:09.399 --> 20:12.710
He gave Sharon a ride home
to pick up her novel.

20:12.710 --> 20:15.733
Who's to say he didn't
drive Kira to get hers?

20:15.733 --> 20:18.107
Eames, it's a reach.

20:18.107 --> 20:19.522
He still drive a Jag?

20:19.522 --> 20:23.804
A new one every three years,
just like his harassment suits.

20:23.804 --> 20:25.363
If he drove his other victims home,

20:25.363 --> 20:28.481
you might have enough for
a search warrant on his car.

20:33.889 --> 20:40.179
Lionel, the...
the new one, it's not...

20:42.656 --> 20:50.974
You know... sometimes your greatest
triumph can be your Albatross.

20:50.974 --> 20:57.003
This life I have...
the one you've given me...

20:57.326 --> 21:00.256
I can't go back.

21:03.212 --> 21:05.446
Have a drink.

21:05.446 --> 21:09.937
It's okay.
You'll feel better.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.213
This is synthetic hair.

21:23.213 --> 21:26.922
Your wife's extensions, Mr. Sage?

21:28.079 --> 21:29.819
Hang on.

21:34.748 --> 21:36.737
Compact.

21:39.777 --> 21:42.618
That's an odd shade for a blonde.

21:42.867 --> 21:46.271
You gave Kira a ride after all.

21:52.161 --> 21:54.562
Does your client recognize these women?

21:54.562 --> 21:56.483
Only as shakedown artists.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.995
Those charges were settled.
Each liar received her quick buck.

21:59.995 --> 22:04.552
Well, your client told us
that he left Kira Danforth in a bar.

22:04.552 --> 22:07.653
But we found proof that
she was in his Jaguar.

22:07.653 --> 22:10.587
So what does that make him?

22:14.167 --> 22:15.802
Okay.

22:15.802 --> 22:19.329
I drove her home, and that's it.

22:19.598 --> 22:21.533
Kira rejected you,

22:21.533 --> 22:23.987
and you were afraid that she'd talk,

22:23.987 --> 22:27.221
so you came back to make sure
that she wouldn't?

22:27.221 --> 22:31.900
No. Kira ran up to get her novel.

22:31.900 --> 22:35.879
Now, I can't afford mixed messages,
so I waited in my car...

22:35.879 --> 22:40.899
When I realized where I was,
in my Jag in the 'hood.

22:40.899 --> 22:45.487
So I set my GPS for civilization,
and I got the hell out.

22:45.487 --> 22:50.294
Here's his GPS log.
Mr. Sage was home by 10:30.

22:50.294 --> 22:52.019
Why didn't you tell us this before?

22:52.019 --> 22:56.742
I was afraid of how it would look,
given that people like to tell lies about me.

22:56.742 --> 23:01.839
These women, they're sworn to secrecy
as part of their settlement.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.087
So who you talking about?

23:05.229 --> 23:07.329
Lionel Shill?

23:07.329 --> 23:09.318
Why is he mad at you?

23:09.318 --> 23:14.194
He's mad at himself for squandering
what little talent he had.

23:14.194 --> 23:16.341
He projects his loathing onto me

23:16.341 --> 23:18.742
and anyone else that
he might be jealous of.

23:18.742 --> 23:21.971
You're saying that
that would include Kira?

23:21.971 --> 23:26.930
Well, Kira had two things
that Shill lacks...

23:26.930 --> 23:30.777
A voice and a future.

23:57.169 --> 24:00.529
Gareth was home long
before Kira was shot.

24:00.529 --> 24:02.421
Which means
we're back to square one.

24:02.421 --> 24:07.132
Maybe not. This is the galleys
to Shill's new novel.

24:07.132 --> 24:13.695
It's about a young black painter's rise
from poverty to Manhattan's posh art scene.

24:13.695 --> 24:17.328
He's calling it "Token".

24:19.444 --> 24:21.506
So...

24:21.762 --> 24:25.391
How closely does it hew to the novel
Kira was gonna give Gareth?

24:25.391 --> 24:26.939
We haven't been able to find it.

24:26.939 --> 24:31.181
Kira's computer was smashed
the night she was killed.

24:31.181 --> 24:33.512
Just how desperate is Mr. Shill?

24:33.512 --> 24:36.267
Well, his last six novels
crashed and burned.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.656
He makes a living on the lecture circuit.

24:38.656 --> 24:40.731
You know, Ariana Cypher,

24:40.731 --> 24:45.942
she said that Kira was always
the first person in the office.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.869
Maybe she came early
to work on her novel.

24:48.869 --> 24:51.526
Take another pass
at Kira's work computer.

24:51.526 --> 24:54.018
Don't tell Ariana why.

24:54.018 --> 24:55.659
Can you do that?

24:55.659 --> 25:00.381
I wanna talk to one of the characters
in Shill's novel.

25:02.184 --> 25:05.640
I never read what she wrote.
Writing stuff wasn't my bag.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.869
Kira loved ya.

25:06.869 --> 25:09.724
She loved the way you sang.
What was the song?

25:09.724 --> 25:12.353
Forgot what tune it was. Uh...

25:12.353 --> 25:15.064
Made her smile... Shine eye girl.

25:15.064 --> 25:17.039
How you know that?

25:17.658 --> 25:19.832
Because I read it.

25:19.832 --> 25:22.275
Kira wrote about me?

25:23.165 --> 25:25.163
I'm not sure I'm feelin' that.

25:25.163 --> 25:27.909
Why, you got something to hide?

25:30.332 --> 25:33.153
I was 16. I stole a beemer.

25:33.153 --> 25:34.993
Ended up in Spofford for a year.

25:34.993 --> 25:39.843
And Kira... she came
to see me every week.

25:39.843 --> 25:42.842
Well, she didn't write
anything about that.

25:44.323 --> 25:48.895
Look, she ever tell you
what Shill thought about her novel?

25:48.895 --> 25:51.241
He never let her read it
in front of his group.

25:51.241 --> 25:53.061
She'd come home in tears.

25:53.061 --> 25:58.326
No matter how hard she worked,
he said it wasn't enough.

26:01.373 --> 26:06.191
Kira's manuscript was in a file
on her hard drive titled budgets.

26:06.191 --> 26:10.651
You know, I spoke to D tour,
and Shill stole her voice.

26:10.651 --> 26:14.408
Kira's last phone calls were to Shill.

26:14.408 --> 26:15.865
Yeah, but he might have snapped

26:15.865 --> 26:18.533
if she told him that Sage was
interested in her novel.

26:18.533 --> 26:22.412
I don't know if I see Shill
leaving his West Village townhouse

26:22.412 --> 26:26.121
to shoot his protege
in a Brooklyn ghetto.

26:26.121 --> 26:28.629
Yeah, but the guy is
desperate for a comeback.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.833
If Kira exposed him for what he is,

26:30.833 --> 26:33.453
I can't see that guy
surviving humiliation like that.

26:33.453 --> 26:36.464
- I know guys like this.
- I know you do.

26:36.948 --> 26:38.879
I've met your mentor.

26:38.879 --> 26:40.978
Well, it's not about that.

26:40.978 --> 26:44.142
It's about finding the truth.
We gotta bring this guy in now.

26:44.142 --> 26:46.978
Let's talk to Shill on his own turf.

26:47.183 --> 26:54.163
You know, Phillip Green could attest
that the three of us were home all night.

26:54.163 --> 26:56.604
Of course, he's in Stockholm,

26:56.604 --> 27:00.963
so perhaps it would be
easier to contact TJ.

27:00.963 --> 27:05.188
Your loyal protege TJ Hawkins.

27:05.759 --> 27:07.889
Now, he owes his career to you.

27:07.889 --> 27:10.007
Well, he's been kind enough to say so.

27:10.007 --> 27:13.688
In the same way that you owe
Kira your comeback.

27:13.688 --> 27:15.194
Pardon?

27:15.194 --> 27:17.731
You stole her book.

27:17.972 --> 27:20.758
Right? Your new book.

27:20.758 --> 27:23.726
Kira's life is an inspiration, but I...

27:23.726 --> 27:28.541
Would you do me a favor?
Could you read this?

27:28.541 --> 27:31.144
I marked it here...

27:31.144 --> 27:34.151
Can you read this for me?

27:35.748 --> 27:37.863
Look, just...

27:38.246 --> 27:40.039
Yeah.

27:43.075 --> 27:46.048
"He was making chicken stew.

27:46.048 --> 27:51.658
"The fetor of garlic pulled her back,
but she was determined to go."

27:51.658 --> 27:53.744
That's a nice piece of writing.

27:53.744 --> 27:58.009
- Thank you.
- "D cooks stew chicken."

27:58.468 --> 28:01.017
"The smell of garlic burrows
into my silk blouse.

28:01.017 --> 28:05.486
I leave, reeking of home
and feeling like a traitor."

28:06.518 --> 28:09.435
We found Kira's novel.

28:10.844 --> 28:16.638
It's not as purple as your prose, but...

28:16.638 --> 28:20.356
I don't know, to me it rings truer.

28:20.606 --> 28:22.205
Everyone's a critic.

28:22.205 --> 28:25.760
And you're a plagiarist, aren't you?

28:25.760 --> 28:29.629
You're a fake.
A hack.

28:29.629 --> 28:33.459
If word got out,
those lecture fees would dry up.

28:33.459 --> 28:37.646
Kira trusted you,
and you stole from her.

28:37.646 --> 28:40.238
And you are being hyperbolic, detective!

28:40.238 --> 28:42.515
I'm not done!

28:47.137 --> 28:50.651
I'd like for you to say
that you're a fraud.

28:58.229 --> 29:00.872
Have a seat.
Go ahead.

29:01.231 --> 29:02.855
Come on.

29:03.349 --> 29:06.134
I'd like you to say it.

29:15.576 --> 29:17.785
Okay.

29:20.395 --> 29:23.010
You pulled back the curtain,

29:23.010 --> 29:27.021
and you found a pathetic old man...

29:27.021 --> 29:31.816
who coveted a brilliant
young writer's future.

29:32.502 --> 29:36.440
Perhaps he... he took her words.

29:37.732 --> 29:42.451
Only her words.
Not her life.

29:47.424 --> 29:49.836
You killed Kira to save your legacy.

29:49.836 --> 29:51.670
What legacy?

29:51.670 --> 29:55.658
My last novel sold less than
a thousand copies.

29:55.658 --> 29:58.583
I was here...

29:58.583 --> 30:03.829
As I am every night, drinking...

30:18.507 --> 30:20.420
All right!

30:20.767 --> 30:23.838
I'll give you Phillip's number.

30:24.194 --> 30:27.430
I was... I was hoping to
spare him this, but

30:27.430 --> 30:31.844
he will certify that
I was home all night.

30:37.718 --> 30:42.759
My god, if I didn't know better,
I'd swear this was personal.

30:50.466 --> 30:54.504
I just woke up a very cranky
Phillip Green in Stockholm.

30:54.504 --> 30:58.566
He says he and TJ and Shill
got to Shill's home around 11:30

30:58.566 --> 31:03.379
where he spent most of the night
in the guest room recovering.

31:03.379 --> 31:04.791
Recovering from what?

31:04.791 --> 31:07.868
An overabundance of Grappa.

31:08.817 --> 31:11.896
Why don't you go back to
the one guy in this mix

31:11.896 --> 31:13.857
who actually admits
to being a murderer?

31:13.857 --> 31:15.584
The poser without a motive?

31:15.584 --> 31:16.820
Eames...

31:16.820 --> 31:22.080
We've seen the bitter fate
of being a one-hit wonder.

31:27.306 --> 31:32.180
Do you have any idea what was
on Kira's mind the night of the reading?

31:32.411 --> 31:35.386
What, you couldn't beat
an answer out of Lionel?

31:39.772 --> 31:41.962
He's mad at me.

31:41.962 --> 31:44.077
Is that because I went
after your mentor like that?

31:44.077 --> 31:47.182
Look, Kira was your friend.

31:47.182 --> 31:49.238
She was in trouble.

31:49.238 --> 31:50.941
She didn't tell you anything?

31:50.941 --> 31:53.476
I didn't have time to talk to her
before the reading.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.095
Then she hooked up with Sage.

31:55.095 --> 31:57.266
And when she called the restaurant?

31:57.266 --> 31:58.993
I didn't know she called.

31:58.993 --> 32:00.202
Phillip was holding court,

32:00.202 --> 32:05.309
telling stories about smoking pot
in the white house with Allen Ginsberg.

32:06.655 --> 32:10.895
Well, Shill told us
that she was distraught and...

32:10.895 --> 32:13.339
He didn't share that with you at all?

32:13.339 --> 32:15.899
Maybe he thought you'd
break out into a violent rage.

32:15.899 --> 32:18.183
You know, he showed you off
as his prized pupil,

32:18.183 --> 32:22.716
but maybe he thought deep down
you were still an animal.

32:24.559 --> 32:27.458
Let me do it. Here, come on.
Go ahead.

32:27.458 --> 32:29.245
- You don't wanna stand there.
- Come on. / Yeah?

32:29.245 --> 32:30.767
- Come on, TJ.
- Okay.

32:30.767 --> 32:32.543
Let's see what you got.

32:33.450 --> 32:35.006
Come on.

32:35.006 --> 32:36.943
Give it your best shot.

32:37.894 --> 32:39.881
That's it?
That's... that's what you have?

32:39.881 --> 32:41.877
Is that it? That's all he's got?

32:41.877 --> 32:43.778
Okay, maybe this'll make it
easier for you, look.

32:43.778 --> 32:45.713
Oh, Bobby...

32:46.684 --> 32:50.531
Sorry about the flies.
They're all over the place.

32:52.245 --> 32:55.436
Show me something. Come on.

32:58.406 --> 33:00.955
Show me something.

33:01.528 --> 33:04.406
I only start what I can finish.

33:09.875 --> 33:13.497
Well, I guess there weren't enough
cameras around for him to give us a show.

33:13.497 --> 33:15.773
Well, he gave us a tell.

33:15.773 --> 33:18.430
Turned his back
when he walked away.

33:19.005 --> 33:23.765
Which would have been the first thing
he'd learn not to do in the pen.

33:28.646 --> 33:31.633
Thank you very much. Ashkourak.

33:31.633 --> 33:33.163
You two punched in early.

33:33.163 --> 33:36.306
Well, they're seven hours
ahead of us in Yemen.

33:36.306 --> 33:40.917
The jail that TJ claims to have served time
in burned down in 2004.

33:40.917 --> 33:44.960
And the state department has no record
of TJ ever being in Yemen.

33:44.960 --> 33:48.485
I may be dense, but what has this
got to do with Kira Danforth?

33:48.485 --> 33:51.700
TJ's new book, "American delinquent".

33:51.700 --> 33:55.426
Now, he doesn't name
the juvie detention center,

33:55.426 --> 33:58.301
but he writes about it.

33:58.301 --> 34:02.352
He says that he could
smell raw meat from his cell.

34:02.702 --> 34:05.761
The produce and meat center
in the Bronx. It's Spofford.

34:05.761 --> 34:08.964
That's where D tour spent a year
for stealing a car.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.023
Now, I called D tour again

34:11.023 --> 34:14.784
and told him some of the things
that TJ says in this book.

34:14.784 --> 34:15.777
He laughed.

34:15.777 --> 34:18.291
TJ did enough research
to sound convincing.

34:18.291 --> 34:23.360
It was just his bad luck that Kira's
boyfriend was actually there.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.106
Okay, but how can she hurt him?
She's an unpublished writer.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.167
He's on the top of the best-seller list.

34:28.167 --> 34:31.054
But not with "American delinquent".

34:31.054 --> 34:33.963
The Daily Times hasn't
published a review yet.

34:33.963 --> 34:36.009
Powerhouse author like Hawkins,

34:36.009 --> 34:38.476
that review should have run
in time with the release.

34:38.476 --> 34:43.514
Unless whoever wrote it...
could turn it in.

34:44.567 --> 34:49.402
Okay, I should have told you
that Kira was going to review TJ's book.

34:49.402 --> 34:51.929
- In the Times.
- Yes.

34:51.929 --> 34:53.862
When did you tell TJ?

34:53.862 --> 34:55.668
I didn't.

34:56.231 --> 34:59.982
I didn't want TJ pressuring Kira.
It was too risky.

34:59.982 --> 35:04.559
The night that you took Kira out
after the reading...

35:04.559 --> 35:07.228
You knew that you didn't want
to represent her novel.

35:07.228 --> 35:09.593
TJ and Kira were friends.

35:09.593 --> 35:13.233
I would assume that
the review would be a rave, sure.

35:13.233 --> 35:15.832
But I wanted to cover my bases.

35:15.832 --> 35:19.330
Hey, any chance the Times
let you see that review?

35:19.330 --> 35:21.346
Kira never handed it in.

35:21.346 --> 35:24.335
It was due the day
after she was killed.

35:24.335 --> 35:26.605
Great! Just my luck.

35:26.605 --> 35:30.011
Now they're gonna have to reassign.
The thing could take weeks.

35:30.011 --> 35:34.118
Well, I'm sure you can come up with
someone else who can write it.

35:34.118 --> 35:37.148
- What are you saying?
- Well, Kira's unpublished.

35:37.148 --> 35:39.392
She couldn't have gotten
the gig at the Times

35:39.392 --> 35:41.894
unless someone cashed in a favor.

35:42.295 --> 35:46.176
The day they let agents
choose who's gonna review books

35:46.176 --> 35:49.570
is the day even I think
the business is too sleazy.

35:49.570 --> 35:53.289
Okay, if it wasn't you,
how'd Kira get the assignment?

35:53.289 --> 35:55.612
How did she get the assignment?

35:56.079 --> 36:00.076
Who do you think the Times
editor studied under?

36:00.769 --> 36:04.044
Shill got Kira assigned
to review his protege's book,

36:04.044 --> 36:06.749
Kira's first big break.

36:06.749 --> 36:08.516
Goren.

36:09.062 --> 36:12.165
Oh, is that right?
All right, thanks.

36:12.165 --> 36:14.748
Ballistics. They got a hit on that .22.

36:14.748 --> 36:16.794
They already ran that gun.
Came up empty.

36:16.794 --> 36:20.683
Yeah, in New York.
I had a friend run it in Jersey.

36:20.683 --> 36:24.403
Turns out, it was used
in the Newark riots to shoot a cop.

36:24.403 --> 36:26.801
That boy Shill taught in prison...

36:26.801 --> 36:30.623
He not only got a novel out of him.
He got the kid's gun?

36:30.623 --> 36:33.838
Same as the book, right? Kid gives
the teacher the gun for safekeeping.

36:33.838 --> 36:36.714
Kira was swimming with sharks.
Shill's a thief.

36:36.714 --> 36:38.578
TJ's a fraud...

36:38.578 --> 36:42.121
Either one of them could have taken
that gun to brooklyn.

36:46.482 --> 36:49.397
I wanted to open
with something memorable.

36:49.397 --> 36:52.374
Well, my dear, two things:

36:52.374 --> 36:54.491
First, it wasn't memorable.

36:54.491 --> 36:58.143
It was like Joyce Carol Oates on barbiturates.

36:58.143 --> 37:03.035
Secondly, your opening sentence
must be a promise of a truth worth reading.

37:03.035 --> 37:06.338
Anything less is blasphemy.

37:10.942 --> 37:14.197
They followed me in.
They have badges.

37:14.197 --> 37:16.416
We're in the middle of our salon.

37:16.416 --> 37:18.623
It's okay. I wanted to see the...

37:18.623 --> 37:23.140
Master at work, you know, plotting the...
psychological intrigue.

37:23.140 --> 37:26.430
The way that you manipulate lives, as if...

37:26.430 --> 37:31.096
They were characters in your own life novel
where you play god.

37:31.096 --> 37:33.356
Show some respect, Sherlock.

37:33.356 --> 37:35.242
Respect. That's important, isn't it?

37:35.242 --> 37:40.349
Where'd you learn that,
at that hellhole in Yemen or at Spofford?

37:40.349 --> 37:42.754
Hard time is hard time.

37:43.036 --> 37:44.917
Been good for you.
How's that second book...

37:44.917 --> 37:47.295
Oh, wait.
It hasn't really caught on fire yet.

37:47.295 --> 37:49.438
You still waiting on the Times review?

37:49.438 --> 37:52.940
A good friend like Kira singing your praises.

37:52.940 --> 37:55.491
That would have been a slam dunk.

37:55.491 --> 37:58.577
Did you know that
Mr. Shill got Kira the job,

37:58.577 --> 38:04.621
conned an editor friend of his over there
into glossing over Kira's conflict of interest?

38:04.621 --> 38:07.142
She was the perfect choice, wasn't she,

38:07.142 --> 38:10.902
because of her connection
to the material?

38:10.902 --> 38:14.514
I love Kira's life
spent a year in Spofford.

38:14.514 --> 38:18.513
She knows the truth
of that place, you know?

38:18.513 --> 38:20.433
When she read your book,
she saw it for what it was.

38:20.433 --> 38:22.616
It was pure fiction.

38:22.616 --> 38:25.861
Her expose would have
been front page news.

38:25.861 --> 38:28.722
So you had to stop that.

38:33.691 --> 38:36.734
How did you know that he was a fake?

38:36.734 --> 38:39.185
Did Kira tell you that,
or you figure that out on your own?

38:39.185 --> 38:42.155
You know this is absolute nonsense.

38:44.497 --> 38:45.986
Kira show you this?

38:45.986 --> 38:48.983
It's Kira's novel in progress.
Here.

38:48.983 --> 38:51.382
I'll take it.

38:51.805 --> 38:53.937
You should have a look at it.

38:53.937 --> 38:56.347
You'll recognize it.

38:56.347 --> 39:00.929
He stole her voice and her life.
He put his name on it.

39:03.735 --> 39:05.586
You're lying.

39:10.593 --> 39:12.681
Read it.

39:15.727 --> 39:19.094
Second call that she made to you...

39:19.094 --> 39:21.850
She had been beaten up, you know.
She was hurt. She was scared.

39:21.850 --> 39:24.456
She reached out to you,
and what did you do?

39:24.456 --> 39:27.310
I could not understand a word
she was saying.

39:27.310 --> 39:30.500
No, you showed TJ her review.

39:30.500 --> 39:34.359
Oh, TJ, they're trying to provoke you.

39:34.359 --> 39:36.547
Come on, TJ.

39:36.992 --> 39:39.778
He set you up to kill Kira,

39:39.778 --> 39:41.776
not because she was
gonna expose you,

39:41.776 --> 39:45.244
but because she was gonna expose him.

39:45.244 --> 39:48.334
You know, you don't wanna
read that thing? That's fine.

39:48.334 --> 39:52.440
Read Shill's.
Let's have a look at yours.

39:52.882 --> 39:55.502
"She rides the train to Midtown.

39:55.502 --> 40:00.401
"The other black women
in their secretary vest eye her.

40:00.401 --> 40:04.862
"Sample sale clothes.
Straightened hair."

40:04.862 --> 40:07.694
You son of a bitch.

40:07.987 --> 40:14.072
You knew I was down about my book,
afraid I was gonna... lose everything.

40:14.072 --> 40:16.656
He wound you up.
He gave you a gun.

40:16.656 --> 40:18.671
Where would I get a gun, TJ?

40:18.671 --> 40:22.564
Lamar Styles. Remember him?

40:22.967 --> 40:26.889
He shot a cop in the Newark riots in '67.

40:26.889 --> 40:30.640
The bullets they found in Kira
were from that same gun.

40:30.640 --> 40:33.654
He gave it to you, didn't he?

40:38.392 --> 40:40.547
Yes.

40:40.879 --> 40:43.945
But before he did,
he cut me a line of coke.

40:43.945 --> 40:46.576
I'd been clean for five years.

40:46.576 --> 40:49.288
He told me I deserved it.

40:49.288 --> 40:51.561
Then he cut another one.

40:51.561 --> 40:54.715
Told me to go get
the cigar box from his desk.

40:54.715 --> 40:57.646
Oh, you ingrate.

40:58.031 --> 41:01.148
He told me to take the piece.

41:03.120 --> 41:06.433
Be the man I wrote about.

41:10.507 --> 41:13.786
When I got to Kira's apartment, I...

41:13.786 --> 41:15.669
I confronted her about the review.

41:15.669 --> 41:18.239
Yeah, but she didn't want
to hear about any review.

41:18.239 --> 41:20.564
Not from a fraud like you.

41:20.564 --> 41:24.048
She told me I would never
be able to use a real gun

41:24.048 --> 41:26.790
'cause I wasn't real.

41:26.790 --> 41:31.238
She mocked me, taunted me.

41:31.238 --> 41:34.658
You needed to show her
that you were real.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.441
I pulled the trigger.

41:36.441 --> 41:39.805
But you didn't even have
the courage to finish the job.

41:39.805 --> 41:42.167
Kira bled to death.

41:42.167 --> 41:47.826
TJ Hawkins, you are under arrest
for the murder of Kira Danforth.

41:48.915 --> 41:54.264
Lionel Shill, you're under arrest
for conspiring in the murder of Kira Danforth.

41:54.264 --> 41:56.599
TJ.

41:56.599 --> 42:00.240
From my triumph to my Albatross.

42:04.019 --> 42:06.170
See those writers?

42:06.170 --> 42:09.371
They're gonna have a hell of a story.
