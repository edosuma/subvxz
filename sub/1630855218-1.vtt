nothing left.

13:48.894 --> 13:51.230
We ain't got nothing
left anyway, Uncle.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.800
- This is true.
- Stop kidding yourself.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.603
Let's go in.

13:57.603 --> 14:00.306
All right, boys,
let's get a deer.

14:00.306 --> 14:03.542
Yeah, let's do that.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.194
Okay, you lovebirds,

15:29.194 --> 15:30.596
- speeches in 20 minutes.
- I have convinced

15:30.596 --> 15:32.798
your father to say nothing,
you'll be happy to hear.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.633
- Why? What was he gonna say?
- Uh, well,

15:34.633 --> 15:36.969
he's your father,
so he was gonna embarrass you.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.904
Haha! Yeah, a lot
of single entendres.

15:38.904 --> 15:41.106
- You know your dad.
- Please excuse me for

15:41.106 --> 15:42.408
a moment. I'll be right back.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.009
Goodbye, darling.
Bye, sweetheart.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.111
[piano music playing]

15:48.414 --> 15:52.284
Mom, why are you
standing over here all alone?

15:52.284 --> 15:54.453
Where should I be standing?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.422
Go socialize.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.925
And why is this party
so many people?

15:59.925 --> 16:01.727
With so much display?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.730
They have to let us know
how much money they're spending?

16:04.730 --> 16:07.466
Mom, please lower your voice
and please don't say that

16:07.466 --> 16:09.601
- to anybody else.
- Who am I talking to?

16:09.601 --> 16:12.438
Look, there is
Dad and Cheryl.

16:13.272 --> 16:14.840
I can't talk to him.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.508
You don't have to see him;
I'll talk to him.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.211
- [speaking Hebrew]
- He should live and be well.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.380
Hahaha! You go, you go.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.482
[woman laughing]
[Esther sighs]

16:23.482 --> 16:26.251
Dad, you didn't tell me
Cheryl was coming.

16:26.251 --> 16:28.687
- Are you having a great time?
- Mm-hmm.

16:28.687 --> 16:30.622
Thank you so much for coming.
You know, why don't you

16:30.622 --> 16:32.491
go get a plate and I'll
be back in a minute.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.927
Wait a sec. Not done bragging
about you. Where are you going?

16:34.927 --> 16:37.663
- Hildie!
- Esther!

16:37.663 --> 16:41.166
Hey, how is everyone behaving on
scale from terrible to terrible?

16:41.166 --> 16:43.135
- Neh.
- Yeah.

16:43.135 --> 16:46.038
Well, you look like a rock star
and fuck 'em, right?

16:46.038 --> 16:48.407
- [women chuckling]
- I gotta show her something.

16:48.407 --> 16:49.975
Aw, is it your dick?

16:49.975 --> 16:53.612
[scoffs]: No.
[Hildie chuckles]

16:57.916 --> 17:00.619
- David, where are we going?
- Shh, shh, shh.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.290
[indistinct conversations]

17:07.359 --> 17:08.494
Hey.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.462
How you doing?

17:11.663 --> 17:13.365
I'm good. I'm fine.

17:14.566 --> 17:15.934
I am.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.737
You, uh...

17:18.737 --> 17:20.839
You only have in one earring.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.443
Oh my!
[David chuckles]

17:30.149 --> 17:31.950
How are you doing?

17:34.319 --> 17:36.121
- David--
- Okay, okay, okay,

17:36.121 --> 17:37.723
I'll drop it,
but you're lying

17:37.723 --> 17:41.026
and it's not even...
good lying.

17:41.026 --> 17:44.096
- What did you want to show me?
- Wanted to show you the stairs.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.964
This is the stairwell. Welcome.

17:47.232 --> 17:51.203
And, uh... I wanted to give you
a little break from the party.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.509
I like this dress.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.649
I can reach right up it.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.260
[panting]

18:19.765 --> 18:21.433
[moaning]

18:21.433 --> 18:23.435
Yeah, we probably should
get back to the party.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.438
[Esther laughing]
It's right through there.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.876
[clinking]
Or we could stay.

18:30.876 --> 18:33.245
[unzipping noise]
Oh yeah.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.813
We could stay, huh?

18:35.581 --> 18:37.716
No, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

18:38.617 --> 18:39.918
You're right.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.556
[Esther exhales]

18:44.556 --> 18:47.092
[Esther laughing]

18:48.093 --> 18:50.195
[zipping noise]

18:50.195 --> 18:51.797
I'm sorry.

18:57.736 --> 18:59.605
I fucking love you.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.060
[woman speaking indistinctly]

19:24.496 --> 19:27.099
- [double knock]
- Hi, everybody.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.301
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Hildie.

19:29.301 --> 19:32.671
Um, I'm gonna make a bitchin'
speech at the wedding.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.240
[laughing]
But for now,

19:35.240 --> 19:37.042
a quick introduction.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.678
Esther is consistently

19:39.678 --> 19:42.414
the most beautiful
person I know.

19:43.315 --> 19:47.219
And, uh, David's all right.
[laughing]

19:47.219 --> 19:49.254
And now the happy couple!

19:49.254 --> 19:51.323
- Lehayim
- [crowd]: Lehayim

19:51.323 --> 19:53.659
[chuckling]
[applause]

19:54.459 --> 19:56.128
[Esther]: That was great.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.996
[insects stridulating]
[birds tweeting]

19:59.831 --> 20:03.335
- You all right, Antsy Pants?
- Mm-hmm.

20:25.257 --> 20:30.362
[car engine sound approaching]

20:34.533 --> 20:36.368
Niizh, no!

20:37.236 --> 20:38.870
[glass clinks]

20:40.973 --> 20:43.809
Jesus Christ!

20:43.809 --> 20:45.244
[car door opens]

20:45.244 --> 20:48.113
So, for all of Esther's
friends from law school,

20:48.113 --> 20:50.015
I'm a resident
at Beth Israel General

20:50.015 --> 20:52.484
- in emergency medicine.
- My son the doctor!

20:52.484 --> 20:54.419
- [people laughing]
- Thanks, Dad. Yeah.

20:54.419 --> 20:58.090
There have been
some interesting shifts.

20:59.157 --> 21:01.293
Uh, like the guy who took
an axe to his own forehead

21:01.293 --> 21:03.462
and was bleeding
all over the ground.

21:04.229 --> 21:07.065
And then when I come home and
I tell Esther all about this...

21:07.065 --> 21:09.768
[some people chuckle]
...how I slipped in the blood,

21:09.768 --> 21:13.205
how I started vomiting outside,
how the axe guy saw me vomiting,

21:13.205 --> 21:15.007
and I had to sort of pretend
like I wasn't vomiting

21:15.007 --> 21:17.676
because of him.
[chuckling]

21:17.676 --> 21:19.444
Esther puts up
with a lot.

21:20.245 --> 21:23.382
She puts up with
all that and more.

21:23.382 --> 21:24.750
[camera clicks]

21:25.517 --> 21:29.021
When I'm with Esther,
I feel happy.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.624
Without her, I don't know
what happiness even is.

21:34.426 --> 21:35.827
[camera clicks]

21:35.827 --> 21:38.430
Uh, that's what I mean

21:38.430 --> 21:40.299
when I say that I love you.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.269
To Esther.

21:44.269 --> 21:46.505
- [crowd]: To Esther!
- [man]: Mazel tov!

21:46.505 --> 21:48.707
[woman]: Mazel tov!
[applause]

21:57.516 --> 21:59.551
[man]: Did you think this
is funny? Hey, this is cracked!

21:59.551 --> 22:01.219
- Go! Run home!
- [man]: Stop!

22:01.219 --> 22:03.555
- Come on! Go get 'em!
- Hey, come back here!

22:03.555 --> 22:05.157
Hey, stop running!

22:05.157 --> 22:06.925
I'm not kidding,
you need to stop right now!

22:06.925 --> 22:10.262
No, Niizh, don't stop!
[girl screams]

22:10.262 --> 22:13.131
[insect buzzing]

22:28.380 --> 22:29.948
[Esther]: To, uh...

22:32.718 --> 22:35.153
Sorry. Nervous.

22:35.153 --> 22:37.255
[people chuckling]

22:38.590 --> 22:40.625
To Marvin and Lea...

22:40.625 --> 22:41.927
Oh.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.062
Thank you for
this beautiful party.

22:44.062 --> 22:47.566
It's huge. I don't know
how the wedding can top it.

22:47.566 --> 22:49.768
[laughing]

22:53.839 --> 22:56.842
David is my bashert.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.746
For all the non-Jews,

23:00.746 --> 23:02.814
all one of you...

23:02.814 --> 23:04.883
[laughing]
Where are you going?

23:06.251 --> 23:09.054
He is my destiny...

23:09.755 --> 23:12.157
...the other half
of my soul.

23:12.157 --> 23:13.492
[camera clicks]

23:15.961 --> 23:18.397
I could talk about him
for hours,

23:18.397 --> 23:20.632
but at this engagement party

23:20.632 --> 23:23.802
among friends,
I want to say...

23:26.972 --> 23:29.808
My mother, Golda...

23:31.309 --> 23:34.246
...she had a sister,

23:34.246 --> 23:36.581
and her name
was Esther.

23:40.018 --> 23:43.522
She died... in Poland.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.729
My mother was 12

23:50.729 --> 23:53.165
when her whole family was...

24:02.073 --> 24:04.943
So, I guess

24:04.943 --> 24:08.013
I do feel there is meaning
in all of this

24:08.013 --> 24:11.049
in a future
with David...

24:13.452 --> 24:16.955
...and in a new
Jewish generation

24:16.955 --> 24:20.959
and in bright shining lives
stretching out ahead of us.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.096
A prayer and then I'm done.

out there?

26:53.411 --> 26:56.381
She and David are the answer
to the Holocaust?

26:56.381 --> 26:58.350
So she's just like
a regular Jew?

26:58.350 --> 27:01.653
- [Tammy]: Mom!
- [Lea]: I know, okay? I know.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.955
David is very happy with her.

27:03.955 --> 27:06.958
She makes him very happy,
I know that.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.193
[Tammy]: So?

27:09.027 --> 27:11.463
So it's not about that.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.566
It's about
all the other things.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.601
We don't know anything
about her family.

27:16.601 --> 27:18.703
Why was she given up
for adoption?

27:18.703 --> 27:20.138
What was
the problem there?

27:20.138 --> 27:22.073
I think we know
what the problem was.

27:22.073 --> 27:23.675
Well, exactly, exactly.

27:23.675 --> 27:26.044
Now what? What? Now she's gonna
be a mother of her own,

27:26.044 --> 27:28.346
and that's... that's
just gonna go fine?

27:28.346 --> 27:30.515
Look, I think you got
one of the good ones.

27:30.515 --> 27:32.517
She's a lawyer.
I have a cousin

who adopted one of them,
and he's into the drugs

27:35.086 --> 27:38.056
- and all that stuff.
- Mom, it's too late for this.

27:38.056 --> 27:41.359
No, it's too late, okay?
That's the whole point.

27:41.359 --> 27:44.829
I didn't realize it was
gonna go this far.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.932

I'll get someone to clean it up.
It's fine.

28:13.191 --> 28:16.327
Nothing.
