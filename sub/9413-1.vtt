00:08.275 --> 00:10.975
I was wrong to,

00:11.546 --> 00:15.621
think that this was going
to be a happy house.

00:15.622 --> 00:20.602
Once we got on to the
road, everything changed.

00:25.586 --> 00:30.206
How do you battle something you can't see?

00:33.201 --> 00:36.681
I don't believe in ghosts.

00:36.908 --> 00:39.488
But I do now.

00:40.857 --> 00:44.277
It's not humanly possible.

00:44.361 --> 00:47.061
Mom! Go, go go!

00:47.374 --> 00:51.154
I was going to die that night.

00:51.427 --> 00:53.391
And all I could think was..

00:53.392 --> 00:57.232
My daughter's going to die too?

01:10.084 --> 01:12.871
<i>Happy Birthday to you.</i>

01:12.872 --> 01:15.759
<i>Happy Birthday to you.</i>

01:15.760 --> 01:19.120
<i>Happy Birthday dear Izzie.</i>

01:19.125 --> 01:22.245
<i>Happy Birthday to you.</i>

01:22.987 --> 01:24.346
And these ones.

01:24.347 --> 01:27.829
Our daughter Isabella was a miracle to us.

01:27.830 --> 01:31.670
We lost three pregnancy's. And..

01:32.268 --> 01:34.483
And we didn't think we
were going to be parents.

01:34.484 --> 01:35.786
Five-years old.

01:35.787 --> 01:37.715
- Yeah.
- Geez.

01:37.716 --> 01:41.736
We'd given up hope, and she came.

01:44.358 --> 01:49.874
Not only did we have our child
that we wanted, she was brilliant.

01:49.875 --> 01:55.775
She always was beyond every level that
she was supposed to be at that age mark.

01:55.936 --> 02:00.376
I couldn't have asked for anything more.

02:04.824 --> 02:06.957
We decided to buy a house, um..

02:06.958 --> 02:09.683
It was time, the apartment was small.

02:09.684 --> 02:12.892
We knew it was time to buy that
house with a white picket fence.

02:12.893 --> 02:16.839
We knew what we were limited
to and what our budget was.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.415
And we found a home that was suitable.

02:19.416 --> 02:23.090
We paid for the inspection and so forth.

02:23.091 --> 02:25.331
It came back there was a
lot of structural damage,

02:25.332 --> 02:30.672
and would cost us a lot of
money in years to come.

02:30.995 --> 02:33.118
As we were talking,

02:33.119 --> 02:37.599
I saw an older gentleman putting
a sign out on his front lawn..

02:37.600 --> 02:40.600
"For Sale By Owner".

02:40.929 --> 02:46.509
It wasn't the house of my
dreams, but I saw potential.

02:57.484 --> 03:00.328
I found it odd that they had
only been living there a year.

03:00.329 --> 03:05.309
And they were all ready
to move, after a year.

03:05.867 --> 03:09.802
The price he was selling the
house for was very cheap,

03:09.803 --> 03:13.151
in comparison to what the houses were
going for on the market at that time.

03:13.152 --> 03:16.496
And he said he would pay all closing costs.

03:16.497 --> 03:20.754
And I said to Brian, we're a young
couple, we have a new child.

03:20.755 --> 03:25.075
Let's take this gift and move forward.

03:30.309 --> 03:32.955
Do I wish I would have been forewarned?

03:32.956 --> 03:34.976
Would I have even believed it?

03:34.977 --> 03:37.169
I had to live it.

03:37.170 --> 03:41.550
I had to be a part of it, to believe.

03:48.173 --> 03:52.133
We had plans for Isabella's room.

03:52.724 --> 03:55.136
But first we had to get
the color off the walls.

03:55.137 --> 03:57.824
It was this real deep dark red.

03:57.825 --> 04:00.373
I mean dark red.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.834
I actually painted it
with gray primer first.

04:02.835 --> 04:05.695
To knock the color out,
and it just didn't help.

04:05.696 --> 04:08.053
I mean it just "bled" right back through.

04:08.054 --> 04:13.954
And it literally looked like
blood was running down the wall.

04:16.988 --> 04:22.889
It actually took 4 to 5 coats
to cover the red in her room.

04:25.111 --> 04:30.943
But she settled in well, my daughter
settled in well to the house.

04:30.944 --> 04:35.437
She had her own room and you
know, she was very happy..

04:35.438 --> 04:37.658
At first.

04:37.794 --> 04:43.694
I started to notice that she would always
wave "bye, bye" to the attic door.

04:46.443 --> 04:51.775
It was a little odd because
there was nothing there.

04:51.776 --> 04:55.248
But I wasn't really worried at that point.

04:55.249 --> 04:58.294
I think our daughter has
an imaginary friend.

04:58.295 --> 05:02.795
Kids do that, kids have imaginary friends.

05:03.122 --> 05:05.823
Emily, you shouldn't have done that.

05:05.824 --> 05:11.561
It wasn't long after, that I
heard her talking and singing.

05:11.562 --> 05:14.294
First I'm thinking she's talking
to the dollies, she's playing.

05:14.295 --> 05:18.036
And all the paint is on the carpet,
and they painted my room red.

05:18.037 --> 05:20.767
And red's a horrible color.

05:20.768 --> 05:23.734
Who are you talking to, sweetheart?

05:23.735 --> 05:25.183
Emily.

05:25.184 --> 05:31.084
She spoke of Emily, like Emily
was right there in front of us.

05:33.747 --> 05:35.391
Well would Emily like one too?

05:35.392 --> 05:37.532
At the beginning it was fun.

05:37.533 --> 05:43.433
I clearly wasn't thinking it was
anything more then an imaginary friend.

05:45.291 --> 05:48.967
But then we began to
notice things in our home

05:48.968 --> 05:53.948
happening and at the time
I blamed my daughter.

05:54.500 --> 06:00.080
I was in the kitchen, Isabella
was playing right nearby.

06:06.070 --> 06:09.250
Then all of a sudden..

06:09.328 --> 06:14.308
I just heard something
hit the floor and break.

06:15.855 --> 06:17.657
The first thing out of
Isabella's mouth was..

06:17.658 --> 06:22.038
"Emily that was bad, that was mommy's."

06:22.451 --> 06:28.127
She just broke a statue and she's
going to blame it on Emily.

06:28.128 --> 06:30.064
My reaction was to be in denial

06:30.065 --> 06:35.420
but I knew from the look on my daughter's
face, Isabella just saw something.

06:35.421 --> 06:40.775
I felt like the hair on the
back of my neck stood up.

06:40.776 --> 06:44.496
Emily doesn't like you, mommy.

06:44.881 --> 06:47.704
"Emily doesn't want you here."

06:47.705 --> 06:51.605
What do you answer back to that?

07:16.469 --> 07:21.389
I noticed that Isabella
began to change a bit.

07:26.788 --> 07:31.708
She started to spend more
time in her bedroom.

07:34.824 --> 07:38.430
I would hear my daughter singing,
"Mary had a little lamb"

07:38.431 --> 07:42.676
and we never taught that to my daughter.

07:42.677 --> 07:47.128
The way she sang the nursery rhyme it
wasn't like she sang other things.

07:47.129 --> 07:53.029
I went on a full investigation of who
taught my daughter the nursery rhyme.

07:53.316 --> 07:56.981
And when I questioned Isabella her
response was, "mommy, I'm learning."

07:56.982 --> 08:02.322
But she wouldn't tell me
who she was learning from.

08:06.949 --> 08:12.849
I'm not the type of person to easily get
scared, like I really have to see it.

08:15.296 --> 08:20.508
One of the first times that I felt
uncomfortable I was in the bathroom..

08:20.509 --> 08:25.849
And I just kept feeling this
sense of being watched.

08:27.582 --> 08:33.059
And I literally felt like a tug
at the bottom of my shirt.

08:33.061 --> 08:35.221
Isabella?

08:35.677 --> 08:37.837
Isabella?

08:39.494 --> 08:41.654
Isabella?

08:44.429 --> 08:47.644
All of a sudden, I seen a shadow

08:47.645 --> 08:53.199
ricochet of of my bedroom door
and shoot down the hallway.

08:53.200 --> 08:59.100
I thought it was the car lights you know
coming the street, shining off the window.

09:00.325 --> 09:03.666
I was like.. "Wait a minute."

09:03.667 --> 09:07.492
We're on the second floor
the shades are down..

09:07.493 --> 09:09.593
It wasn't a car.

09:09.594 --> 09:13.468
And I'm thinking to myself, there
must be something going on here.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.117
And I really didn't want to say
anything to my wife about it yet.

09:16.118 --> 09:22.018
I didn't want to start surmising
and make her really scared.

09:27.030 --> 09:30.788
Later on, Isabella came
running over to the door.

09:30.789 --> 09:33.472
And she had a horrifying look on her face.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.987
Emily's mommy hurt her in the bathtub.

09:35.988 --> 09:40.428
"Emily's mommy hurt her in the bathtub."

09:43.258 --> 09:48.778
She wouldn't know about a
mommy hurting a little girl.

09:49.701 --> 09:53.901
Where is she getting this stuff from?

09:58.489 --> 10:02.114
I could see fear in my daughter.

10:02.115 --> 10:04.501
You have to say goodbye
to Emily, okay, Isabella?

10:04.502 --> 10:10.402
This Emily character make her go away..
It's done Isabella, please.

10:10.986 --> 10:13.978
I just felt a sickness in my stomach.

10:13.979 --> 10:19.879
What went from daughters imaginary
friend is coming to be a ugly story.

10:21.874 --> 10:25.736
Could she be making this up? And..

10:25.737 --> 10:30.012
If she could be making this up, and these
dark things are coming from my daughter.

10:30.013 --> 10:33.373
We need to get her help.

10:37.785 --> 10:43.572
I let Isabella's pediatrician know
we've been having some problems.

10:43.573 --> 10:46.364
So you have an imaginary friend?
What's her name?

10:46.365 --> 10:48.345
Emily.

10:49.428 --> 10:53.774
You know she's not real
though, just pretend.

10:53.775 --> 10:56.655
She's not pretend.

10:58.871 --> 11:03.174
She wasn't at all taken back or
surprised it was normal, it was..

11:03.175 --> 11:07.862
Laurel don't worry about it you
know she'll out grow this.

11:07.863 --> 11:11.997
We've have a very rambunctious
5 year old daughter.

11:11.998 --> 11:15.211
She has a personality,
that's bigger than life.

11:15.212 --> 11:17.912
And she's okay.

11:23.687 --> 11:28.907
The next day, we didn't
hear anything about Emily.

11:31.175 --> 11:33.067
It was normal, it felt great.

11:33.068 --> 11:36.233
Emily you're over. You're done.

11:36.234 --> 11:41.754
The day had been awesome.
We had fun, it was relaxing.

11:48.679 --> 11:54.499
We pull in and Brian was coming
behind me holding Isabella.

12:07.751 --> 12:10.691
She just got quiet.

12:11.599 --> 12:14.899
It just wasn't possible.

12:28.010 --> 12:32.330
The day had been awesome. We had fun..

12:41.544 --> 12:46.773
We were having a conversation as
we were walking in to the door.

12:46.774 --> 12:49.714
She just got quiet.

12:55.026 --> 13:00.589
There was about like 20 pictures
in the middle of the floor.

13:00.590 --> 13:04.701
I was speechless, I could not
believe what we were seeing.

13:04.702 --> 13:06.399
I mean it was a whole
wall full of happiness.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.430
And then it was all off the wall face down.

13:08.431 --> 13:12.711
Like somebody didn't want to see a happy
family, they just wanted to see nothing.

13:12.712 --> 13:16.411
I was scared because, I know I didn't
do it, I know she didn't do it,

13:16.412 --> 13:20.318
and I know that Isabella
couldn't reach it to do it.

13:20.319 --> 13:22.434
Something doesn't want us here.

13:22.435 --> 13:26.153
Something might want my daughter.

13:26.154 --> 13:30.660
I wanted to just leave,
take everything and go.

13:30.661 --> 13:33.943
Financially, that just wasn't
an option at that time.

13:33.944 --> 13:36.517
We were stuck.

13:36.518 --> 13:40.139
And things were getting worse..

13:40.140 --> 13:44.550
I was in the bedroom, one
night Isabella ran up to me..

13:44.551 --> 13:48.289
Daddy the white face is in the window.

13:48.290 --> 13:50.287
"The white face is in the window."

13:50.288 --> 13:55.508
- What's that?
- The white face is in the window..

14:01.264 --> 14:06.040
I seen it.
It was just like a blur of a face.

14:06.041 --> 14:08.995
Honey, you wait here.

14:08.996 --> 14:11.418
I saw it and it freaked me out.

14:11.419 --> 14:14.899
I went and checked it out.

14:20.911 --> 14:25.111
And there was literally nothing there.

14:27.858 --> 14:31.252
I never believed in ghosts, but um..

14:31.253 --> 14:33.533
I do now.

14:34.468 --> 14:37.601
The vibe in my home was turning
negative, it was turning dark.

14:37.602 --> 14:40.295
Things were happening that
were out of my my control.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.236
Hey, Sweetie. Hello.

14:43.521 --> 14:45.012
Let's go.

14:45.013 --> 14:50.353
I needed to make things just
brand new for Isabella.

14:50.742 --> 14:55.962
And Brian's mom took her
away for a weekend trip.

14:56.139 --> 15:00.279
I had a vision for Isabella's room.

15:01.206 --> 15:05.781
I wanted it to be bright,
glowing, soft colors.

15:05.782 --> 15:10.222
So we made one whole wall Wizard Of Oz.

15:13.306 --> 15:16.988
The room was a new thing to all of us.

15:16.989 --> 15:22.889
It was something that we had done and
it feel good for a moment in my home.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.885
I phoned Brian's mom, Judy to come over.

15:26.886 --> 15:32.786
Lets go show Nana your room, because
I made a surprise for you in there.

15:32.804 --> 15:35.444
Oh my goodness!

15:35.993 --> 15:40.488
I walked in to the bedroom.
And said, "Izzie this is so beautiful!"

15:40.489 --> 15:46.389
It looked like Laurel had a
professional come in and decorate.

15:49.366 --> 15:53.779
And I was like really proud of Laurel,
because she had done such a great job.

15:53.780 --> 15:56.570
- Thank you so much for taking care of her.
- Oh you're welcome. Good job in there.

15:56.571 --> 16:02.471
I had my mother-in-law's approval too.
You know she was delighted.

16:06.561 --> 16:10.003
I almost fell on the floor.

16:10.004 --> 16:12.399
"Isabella, what did you do?"

16:12.400 --> 16:14.872
"What happened?
What happened here, Isabella?"

16:14.873 --> 16:16.663
I'd worked so hard.

16:16.664 --> 16:18.157
What happened in here?

16:18.158 --> 16:20.436
I was so angry. What happened?

16:20.437 --> 16:26.337
- "Mommy, please, I didn't do this."
- Mommy, I didn't do it.

16:29.067 --> 16:31.710
I saw my loved ones..

16:31.711 --> 16:34.171
Being afraid.

16:34.807 --> 16:38.467
And I was in so much denial.

16:39.376 --> 16:43.638
I tried to make them think it wasn't real.

16:43.639 --> 16:45.559
And..

16:45.955 --> 16:48.415
It was real.

16:58.849 --> 17:01.400
When I was laying in my bed,
I was thinking that..

17:01.401 --> 17:05.126
Something was watching me,
or was what is in the room,

17:05.127 --> 17:11.027
what was I going to wake up to,
what was going to happen next?

17:15.053 --> 17:16.967
It literally starts to drive you crazy.

17:16.968 --> 17:21.768
It literally starts makes
you lose your mind.

17:24.411 --> 17:28.070
It was all coming to a head.

17:35.853 --> 17:39.306
I could see something was wrong.

17:39.307 --> 17:42.035
I was giving her a bath..

17:42.036 --> 17:46.495
And she said, "Nana, can
I tell you something?"

17:46.496 --> 17:50.636
Emily told me to go out the window.

17:51.315 --> 17:54.300
She told me it's okay to come
out the window and play.

17:54.301 --> 17:57.240
She said she would catch me.

17:57.241 --> 18:00.841
And I said it's not okay to go out
the window you could get hurt.

18:00.842 --> 18:06.362
I said, "if you go out the
window, you're gonna die."

18:08.290 --> 18:13.162
I knew, I knew then it
was a serious problem.

18:13.163 --> 18:19.063
Emily was going to take away somebody
that I truly love and needed in my life.

18:22.654 --> 18:27.874
<i>Everywhere that Mary went
the lamb was sure to go.</i>

18:28.951 --> 18:32.450
We could potentially lose this child..

18:32.451 --> 18:35.391
To.. To an unknown.

18:39.437 --> 18:45.257
We had no options, but to make
sure our daughter was safe.

18:51.544 --> 18:54.355
I mean I put like 12 screws
in each window in her room,

18:54.356 --> 18:57.694
to make sure they were secured shut.

18:57.695 --> 19:00.200
To screw shut my daughter's windows.

19:00.201 --> 19:02.678
That's insane, because what if
there's a fire in the house,

19:02.679 --> 19:04.851
and you know we can't get out,

19:04.852 --> 19:10.752
because I've done screwed the
windows shut on the second floor.

19:11.942 --> 19:15.452
I wanted to open this house
up and bring light in to it.

19:15.453 --> 19:19.700
And now my windows were being nailed shut,
so my daughter didn't go out the window.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.718
If my daughter died, I'd have to die too.

19:22.719 --> 19:26.182
Because I can't.. I couldn't do it..

19:26.183 --> 19:31.583
I couldn't do it I couldn't
be without my daughter.

19:33.781 --> 19:36.376
I was stuck in my home.

19:36.377 --> 19:41.117
And I didn't know what was going to happen.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.597
I didn't know..

19:43.598 --> 19:45.791
If this Emily..

19:45.792 --> 19:50.112
Was going to take my daughter from me.

19:52.655 --> 19:57.282
Isabella never went near the
basement, it was always a no-no,

19:57.283 --> 20:01.363
she just wasn't allowed down there.

20:04.591 --> 20:07.471
The door was shut.

20:15.123 --> 20:18.303
I was instantly afraid.

20:18.573 --> 20:20.913
Oh my God!

20:47.621 --> 20:49.576
I was instantly afraid.

20:49.577 --> 20:51.884
Oh my God!

20:51.885 --> 20:55.382
I feared the worst,
broken neck, busted head.

20:55.383 --> 20:57.877
Emily pulled me down the steps.

20:57.878 --> 21:01.173
Now, my daughter is telling me..

21:01.174 --> 21:05.914
This Emily person pulled
her down the steps.

21:09.028 --> 21:14.668
As much as I was determined
not to let this defeat me..

21:15.650 --> 21:19.250
I felt broken at that point.

21:19.747 --> 21:22.687
But it was either..

21:22.955 --> 21:25.115
Standup..

21:25.318 --> 21:29.925
Or lay back and continue to
let this drive me insane.

21:29.926 --> 21:34.486
You want to put your, your fight face on.

21:34.893 --> 21:39.933
But how do you battle
something, you can't see?

21:47.714 --> 21:51.044
At this point I'm
completely at my wits end.

21:51.045 --> 21:55.602
I went on a crusade to get someone
there to take care of my house.

21:55.603 --> 22:00.184
Whether it be blessed, or
come in to get evidence.

22:00.185 --> 22:04.085
We got in contact with a medium.

22:04.890 --> 22:09.177
I allowed this medium come in to
my home, to do an investigation.

22:09.178 --> 22:13.198
She would get in to a long stare.

22:16.755 --> 22:21.655
<i>Mary had a little lamb..</i>

22:21.664 --> 22:23.799
She sat down.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.720
And..

22:26.136 --> 22:28.356
I heard..

22:28.386 --> 22:30.479
Her sing..

22:30.480 --> 22:32.740
"Mary had a little lamb."

22:32.741 --> 22:37.641
<i>Its fleece was white as snow.</i>

22:38.466 --> 22:43.010
It startled me at first it shocked, it
shocked the hell out of me at first.

22:43.011 --> 22:45.179
Because how would she know to hum that,

22:45.180 --> 22:47.959
or how would she know that my
daughter was singing that.

22:47.960 --> 22:52.010
It came to an immediate stop,
and her voice changed.

22:52.011 --> 22:54.339
Get the bibles out.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.433
Get the bibles out.

22:56.434 --> 22:59.374
Get the bibles out.

22:59.390 --> 23:01.252
Both bibles were taken out of the house.

23:01.253 --> 23:03.590
Get the bibles out.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.716
Get the bibles out.

23:05.717 --> 23:08.705
She still insisted, "get the bibles out."

23:08.706 --> 23:10.006
In this voice..

23:10.007 --> 23:11.857
We only had two bibles.

23:11.858 --> 23:15.638
He said there is another Bible.

23:16.476 --> 23:18.887
And I'm like, he?

23:18.888 --> 23:21.947
And she, was like, "yeah, he".
And I said well,

23:21.948 --> 23:24.737
my daughter talking to Emily not "he."

23:24.738 --> 23:27.834
He's not going to talk to us.

23:27.835 --> 23:29.991
There was a man in my home.

23:29.992 --> 23:33.151
That was preying on my
daughter and I felt terrified.

23:33.152 --> 23:37.982
I felt it was a whole different
level of anxiety then.

23:37.983 --> 23:40.919
It was a whole different level of fear.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.629
He said there's another Bible.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.649
So we just ransacked my daughter's room.

23:46.650 --> 23:50.370
He said there's another Bible.

24:00.156 --> 24:03.876
Sure enough there was a Bible.

24:04.136 --> 24:06.097
Isabella never showed us the Bible.

24:06.098 --> 24:11.750
And there was no way of this
woman knowing it was there.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.989
I believed in everything
she was saying after that.

24:14.990 --> 24:16.292
He hates you.

24:16.293 --> 24:19.618
- I was terrified.
- He hates your daughter.

24:19.619 --> 24:21.556
I was frightened, I was angry.

24:21.557 --> 24:26.174
I had so many emotions, because
I didn't know where to start.

24:26.175 --> 24:29.475
There wasn't a solution.

24:30.301 --> 24:35.415
I felt as if whatever my
daughter has been speaking to,

24:35.416 --> 24:37.557
was now going to prove to me.

24:37.558 --> 24:42.538
"I'm here, I'm real and
I'm gonna show you."

24:58.375 --> 25:00.735
Isabella was in bed.

25:00.736 --> 25:04.456
I was in the room by myself..

25:04.485 --> 25:07.365
And I lit candles.

25:16.044 --> 25:18.924
As I turned away..

25:19.867 --> 25:22.995
It went at least 4 to 5 feet.

25:22.996 --> 25:25.725
The red wax looked like blood
running down the wall.

25:25.726 --> 25:31.626
Just the way it was hot and you
know it cools as it slowly runs.

25:32.251 --> 25:33.978
Laurel.

25:33.979 --> 25:39.137
I was upstairs, I was on
the phone with my mother.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.921
She's saying to me, "you've got
to get out of that house."

25:41.922 --> 25:44.150
"You have to get out of that house."

25:44.151 --> 25:48.831
I know, I know.. Isabella is just so upset.

25:49.410 --> 25:54.156
Out of the corner of my
eye, it was something..

25:54.157 --> 25:56.016
It was so fast.

25:56.017 --> 25:58.165
I don't know..

25:58.166 --> 26:01.646
How to handle this anymore.

26:03.314 --> 26:08.745
Oh my God! Isabella's toy chest
just went across the room.

26:08.746 --> 26:11.489
It felt like a ticking bomb.

26:11.490 --> 26:16.257
We didn't know what was
going to happen next.

26:16.258 --> 26:18.236
And I felt terrified.

26:18.237 --> 26:20.817
To know that..

26:21.000 --> 26:24.180
It was getting violent.

26:25.933 --> 26:30.913
Of those who survived now
only get a fraction..

26:32.042 --> 26:37.922
And I believe it tried showing
itself full force that night.

26:38.921 --> 26:43.421
That night I fell asleep with the TV on.

27:05.262 --> 27:08.022
I knew instantly.

27:08.261 --> 27:10.035
This wasn't my husband.

27:10.036 --> 27:12.136
I knew.

27:13.455 --> 27:17.595
My husband protects me and loves me.

27:17.692 --> 27:21.613
He's never touched me prior to this.

27:21.614 --> 27:25.154
He was possessed by something.

27:25.155 --> 27:26.742
It was an evil..

27:26.743 --> 27:29.503
Evil dark spirit.

27:32.213 --> 27:34.224
It was very shocking.

27:34.225 --> 27:36.118
And I just..

27:36.119 --> 27:38.706
It just wasn't me.

27:38.707 --> 27:43.267
I was scared. I would never hurt my wife.

27:45.931 --> 27:48.222
Brian, Brian, what's going on?

27:48.223 --> 27:51.463
I was against the wall.

27:52.139 --> 27:54.817
It was the look on his face..

27:54.818 --> 27:57.698
A horrifying stare.

27:59.947 --> 28:02.716
He lifted me with one hand..

28:02.717 --> 28:05.180
Grabbed in to my throat.

28:05.181 --> 28:06.905
I was gonna die that night.

28:06.906 --> 28:12.366
And all I could think was,
is Isabella gonna die too?

28:26.532 --> 28:30.072
I was gonna die that night.

28:34.617 --> 28:38.791
I got away and I'm getting down my steps.

28:38.792 --> 28:42.452
Which seemed like an eternity.

28:56.006 --> 29:00.370
When I looked back he
wasn't running after me.

29:00.371 --> 29:02.109
"Laurel, what are you doing?"

29:02.110 --> 29:05.006
"Laurel, are you okay?"

29:05.007 --> 29:07.750
I saw within an instant..

29:07.751 --> 29:10.091
My husband.

29:13.860 --> 29:15.495
He was back to himself.

29:15.496 --> 29:20.296
It was him, he was just as afraid as I was.

29:22.487 --> 29:25.201
I believe the spirit you
know, got a hold of me,

29:25.202 --> 29:28.349
because they knew that we knew the truth.

29:28.350 --> 29:32.455
I believe it tried showing its
self full force that night.

29:32.456 --> 29:35.996
Of what it could really do.

29:46.778 --> 29:50.448
I remember making it to my
dining room and screaming out..

29:50.449 --> 29:53.869
"You've won, it's yours."

29:58.511 --> 30:01.724
It didn't matter I was losing my home.

30:01.725 --> 30:05.790
It didn't matter, as long as I was
leaving with my husband and my daughter.

30:05.791 --> 30:08.626
Safe. We were done.

30:08.627 --> 30:11.987
We'd been through enough.

30:29.250 --> 30:33.101
The very next day, I called my
Aunt and said she would help.

30:33.102 --> 30:37.446
And I should have called and told
her sooner what was going on.

30:37.447 --> 30:41.707
I was just throwing stuff in the car.

30:43.103 --> 30:46.346
I was scared that it was going
to attach its self to something.

30:46.347 --> 30:48.378
I just.. I wanted to start over.

30:48.379 --> 30:51.974
I didn't want to take anything
out of that house with me.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.941
It was a relief.

30:53.942 --> 30:57.921
Like I felt like the whole world
was just lifted of my shoulders.

30:57.922 --> 31:01.402
Like I could breathe again.

31:09.614 --> 31:14.640
We lost a lot, but we walked
away a happy, healthy, family.

31:14.641 --> 31:17.161
We're strong.

31:17.618 --> 31:20.590
If somebody told me today
that I had to move back in

31:20.591 --> 31:22.959
to that house because there
was no other option.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.837
I'd go live in the woods somewhere.

31:25.838 --> 31:31.718
I'd go pitch a tent, because
not going back in that house.

31:31.720 --> 31:37.620
If somebody offered me a million dollars
I wouldn't even go back in that house.

32:00.974 --> 32:03.350
I work for a local newspaper.

32:03.351 --> 32:09.251
I was responsible for covering car
wrecks, fires, criminal activity.

32:10.022 --> 32:14.961
As a reporter, I had never
witnessed anything paranormal,

32:14.962 --> 32:19.282
I never believed in anything like that.

32:19.515 --> 32:22.677
I guess being a typical teenager.

32:22.678 --> 32:27.658
I was always doing stuff
to get on her nerves.

32:30.397 --> 32:32.687
My mother asked me to run errands.

32:32.688 --> 32:35.050
Do you want to come in to town with me?

32:35.051 --> 32:37.805
- Bonnie, wanna come?
- Sure.

32:37.806 --> 32:43.706
My mom also asked to Bonnie, our
exchange student from Pakistan.

32:45.142 --> 32:50.782
Little did I know that was a
trick for going to church.

32:51.057 --> 32:56.957
Misty generally would stay in the
parking lot and refused to come in.

32:59.472 --> 33:04.526
She just slammed the door and
walked in the church without me.

33:04.527 --> 33:06.552
So I turned the music all the way up.

33:06.553 --> 33:12.013
Rolled down the windows, put
my feet on the dashboard.

33:24.560 --> 33:28.940
I waited in the car for about an hour.

33:37.395 --> 33:39.615
Once we..

33:39.772 --> 33:42.832
Got on to the road..

33:42.912 --> 33:48.672
I remember it like, it just
seemed like everything changed.

33:53.340 --> 33:55.402
It was a straight road.

33:55.403 --> 33:58.823
All the way to our house.

33:59.555 --> 34:03.395
You know, it's a desolate road.

34:07.334 --> 34:11.893
By this time, the sun had started setting.

34:14.523 --> 34:17.947
I was getting kinda nervous because
I don't like driving at night,

34:17.949 --> 34:19.963
I can't see that well at night.

34:19.964 --> 34:23.023
But I drive like a little granny.

34:23.024 --> 34:26.530
I hold my hands up like this
and drive straight ahead.

34:26.531 --> 34:30.251
And I don't look either side.

34:31.696 --> 34:37.594
We were going about 50, 55 miles an hour
and when I turned and looked at my mom..

34:37.596 --> 34:41.717
I saw a little movement
on the side of the road.

34:41.719 --> 34:45.978
As we passed, it looked like a child.

34:49.898 --> 34:51.998
I was..

34:52.324 --> 34:58.225
Just had that overwhelming feeling
that something was not right.

35:12.117 --> 35:14.594
Mom, I just saw a little girl.

35:14.595 --> 35:17.501
You know, I knew there was someone there.

35:17.502 --> 35:22.163
And I had to get her to
believe me and turn around.

35:22.164 --> 35:23.638
You should turn around.

35:23.639 --> 35:29.399
She finally said you know, you
better not be lying to me.

35:31.382 --> 35:34.737
I wanted to pacify Misty and..

35:34.738 --> 35:40.638
Let her prove to me that there was a
little girl on the side of the road.

35:50.308 --> 35:54.876
My mom has trouble seeing at night
to drive, so she's very unhappy

35:54.877 --> 35:59.520
that we are still out
with is being so dark.

35:59.521 --> 36:02.341
So where was she?

36:03.085 --> 36:06.745
We went about a half a mile.

36:16.367 --> 36:19.250
- Oh my gosh, mom, that's her.
- There she is.

36:19.251 --> 36:22.191
Okay, there she is.

36:30.804 --> 36:33.664
It wasn't a little girl it was a teenager.

36:33.665 --> 36:36.381
And she was sitting with her knees up..

36:36.382 --> 36:38.482
Rocking.

36:39.465 --> 36:45.365
I guess we went about 50 yards past
her, and then we turned around again.

36:53.864 --> 36:56.856
And we don't see her.. At all.

36:56.857 --> 36:59.499
She was right there.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.821
You think she left?
Where would she have gone?

37:02.822 --> 37:05.733
Well, Misty got frightened.

37:05.734 --> 37:09.881
She said that there was no way you
know, that she wouldn't be there.

37:09.882 --> 37:12.233
I don't know, mom, she
was right there though.

37:12.234 --> 37:16.194
I'm really freaked out right now.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.757
We were going 5 miles an hour.

37:24.758 --> 37:27.785
And we don't see her.

37:27.786 --> 37:30.409
I just thought maybe she
walked through the woods or,

37:30.410 --> 37:34.010
walked somewhere in the area.

37:37.582 --> 37:39.400
I don't know where she would have gone.

37:39.401 --> 37:42.581
So we just kept going.

37:49.042 --> 37:50.750
We're picking up speed.

37:50.751 --> 37:56.091
And my mom was actually
trying get home pretty fast.

37:59.775 --> 38:04.575
We continued on probably
maybe 2 to 3 miles.

38:06.737 --> 38:09.437
I look up and..

38:13.582 --> 38:15.485
Mom, that's her!

38:15.486 --> 38:19.086
I see her in the headlights.

38:29.003 --> 38:32.543
How could she get that far?

38:33.026 --> 38:35.862
It's not humanly possible..

38:35.863 --> 38:39.741
To make it that far up the
road, and not be seen.

38:39.742 --> 38:42.622
Please don't stop.

38:45.918 --> 38:49.578
I know it's her. I see her.

38:55.599 --> 38:57.344
And I..

38:57.345 --> 38:59.586
I like get sick to my stomach.

38:59.587 --> 39:03.731
Don't stop. Please don't stop.
Please don't stop.

39:03.732 --> 39:06.725
Just go. Just keep going, and..

39:06.726 --> 39:11.046
My mom says.. "No, she may need help."

39:18.768 --> 39:20.883
So I just, I hit the floor.

39:20.884 --> 39:23.935
Mom, I'm asking you. Please mom. Please.

39:23.936 --> 39:27.488
I put myself in a fetal position.

39:27.489 --> 39:30.369
Please don't stop.

39:31.285 --> 39:34.850
I knew something was going to
happen, I just didn't know what.

39:34.851 --> 39:37.675
And I didn't want to see it.

39:37.676 --> 39:43.521
My whole focus was to offer her a phone
to call somebody to come pick her up.

39:43.522 --> 39:47.062
Misty, roll down the window.

39:47.076 --> 39:49.108
Misty, please roll down the window.

39:49.109 --> 39:51.029
And..

39:51.600 --> 39:53.991
My mom wants me to roll down the window.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.899
Mom, no.

39:55.900 --> 39:58.339
She just refused.

39:58.340 --> 40:00.728
I thought Misty was overreacting.

40:00.729 --> 40:02.368
I thought it was dark.

40:02.369 --> 40:04.169
No.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.791
My eyes were shut..
You know I closed my eyes really tight

40:12.792 --> 40:14.530
and I put my hands over my ears.

40:14.531 --> 40:17.830
And I was balled up and
I could feel my mom..

40:17.831 --> 40:20.374
And she's rolling down the window.

40:20.375 --> 40:24.951
And I can hear the squeaking
of the window going down.

40:24.952 --> 40:27.983
And she only turns the knob three times.

40:27.984 --> 40:30.068
You know, and you can..

40:30.069 --> 40:34.694
You can hear it going down
and being just turning and..

40:34.695 --> 40:36.975
That dread

40:38.000 --> 40:43.580
it's very quiet except for
the squeaking of the window.

40:45.550 --> 40:47.470
And..

40:47.475 --> 40:49.870
I hear.. I hear her say..

40:49.871 --> 40:52.751
Hey, are you okay?

41:16.144 --> 41:18.322
That dread..

41:18.323 --> 41:21.203
Hey, are you okay?

41:33.350 --> 41:35.911
And there was no face what so ever.

41:35.912 --> 41:38.299
It was hollow.

41:38.300 --> 41:41.180
It was completely..

41:41.317 --> 41:44.257
Everything was gone.

41:47.166 --> 41:48.699
She had no face!

41:48.700 --> 41:50.700
She had no face!

41:50.701 --> 41:56.581
It was the most terrifying,
horrifying thing I've ever seen.

41:58.581 --> 42:02.061
We were home in 2 minutes.

42:02.313 --> 42:08.213
We all practically ran over each
other to get in to the front door.

42:12.496 --> 42:15.892
Once I dialed 911 I felt..

42:15.893 --> 42:21.233
Embarrassed to say that I
saw a hollow face on 136.

42:21.455 --> 42:27.275
So I just told them that I think
somebody needs assistance.

42:37.800 --> 42:42.243
There was a cross and that's
where an accident took place.

42:42.244 --> 42:44.884
That actually a girl from my school..

42:44.885 --> 42:47.820
Was killed on that road.

42:47.821 --> 42:51.061
I feel that it's her..

42:53.146 --> 42:55.871
Grieving for the life that she lost.
