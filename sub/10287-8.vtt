Sometimes I wish
I'd stuck with the accordion.

at a wedding now.

14:30.658 --> 14:32.558
You got a nifty way with words, Irene.

14:34.028 --> 14:36.428
I have to. I do a lot of talking.

14:36.597 --> 14:38.861
That's all most of our clients
want to do, anyway.

wanted to talk about was his bombers.

it was the B-54 this, the C-31 that.

...that you reconsider your decision
on Miss Danbury's private papers.

appreciate the confidentiality...

18:51.251 --> 18:53.811
...Major Pritchard
has made a preliminary judgment...

18:53.987 --> 18:57.980
...that disclosure of said diary could pose
a threat to national-security interests...

...and so has temporarily classified
the document and its copies as secret.
