                 ON MY TIMELINE.

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:15.917
YOU HAVE A TIMELINE?

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:17.085
                       OH, YEAH.

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:17.919
              I HAVE SCHEDULED
              EVERY SINGLE THING

01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:18.787
                WE NEED TO DO
                FOR THE WEDDING,

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:20.322
         IN ORDER, FROM A TO Z.

01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:21.289
              TAKES OUT
              ALL THE GUESSWORK.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:22.190
                   LOOK AT THIS.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.192
OH, WOW.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:25.393
IT TAKES OUT
ALL THE SURPRISE, TOO, HUH?

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:26.494
                       EXACTLY.

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:29.030
HI, EVE.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:29.865
                 NO, NO, NO, NO!

01:04:29.867 --> 01:04:30.899
                           OH...

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:33.235
      BAILEY, COME ON...

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:34.302
     WHY-WHY AREN'T YOU--

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:35.971
EVE-- OKAY.

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:37.939
    WHY AREN'T YOU TRAINING
             THEM?

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:39.307
     BECAUSE THEY'RE DOGS.

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:41.643
   BECAUSE WE'RE AT THE PARK
    AND THEY'RE BEING DOGS.

01:04:41.645 --> 01:04:43.445
   WELL THEN, THEY SHOULD BE
   ON A LEASH AT ALL TIMES.

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:45.480
     NO, THEY SHOULD NOT.

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:47.582
     AND LOOK AT SHIRLEY,
    SHE DOESN'T RUN AROUND.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:48.483
       WHAT ABOUT THAT?
           I MEAN...

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:49.618
NO, I KNOW, THIS IS...

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.852
THIS IS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:52.120
THIS IS WHO SHE IS.

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:54.055
YOU KNOW, ALL DOGS
ARE DIFFERENT.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.258
  WELL, AT LEAST SHE DOESN'T
  SLOBBER ALL OVER EVERYONE.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.259
             I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW
             HOW MANY GERMS

01:04:57.261 --> 01:04:58.493
           ARE IN A DOG'S MOUTH?

01:04:58.495 --> 01:04:59.294
          HOW MANY THINGS
          YOU CAN GET FROM THEM?

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:00.161
           ALL KINDS OF STUFF--

01:05:00.163 --> 01:05:01.196
NOPE, ZERO.

         YOU KNOW WHAT, BAILEY,

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:07.402
        SOMETIMES, I THINK
        YOU CARE MORE ABOUT DOGS

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.838
       THAN YOU DO ABOUT PEOPLE.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.507
YOU REALLY
DON'T LIKE DOGS, DO YOU?

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.143
     THEY'RE NOT MY THING.

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:16.745
  THEY'RE YOUR THING, BAILEY.

01:05:16.747 --> 01:05:18.713
                I TOLD YOU THAT,
                REMEMBER?

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:21.783
        AND SHIRLEY...

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:25.353
   YEAH, I GOT HER JUST FOR
             YOU.

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:29.858
    YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN'T
  UNDERSTAND MY LOVE OF DOGS,

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:33.328
   THEN YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND
              ME.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:36.164
      WHAT DOES ONE THING
   HAVE TO DO WITH ANOTHER?

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:38.133
            [SIGHS]

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:41.002
            I THINK
 IF I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT...

01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:47.242
I DON'T KNOW,
WE SHOULD BE...

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:51.746
WE SHOULD RECONSIDER
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:53.581

       WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
          RECONSIDER?

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:57.052

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:03.158
         I'M GONNA GO.

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:06.962

             YOU'RE GOING TO GO?

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:08.063
                   WHERE ARE YOU
                   GOING TO--

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:10.799
             SHIRLEY, COME HERE.

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:13.768
BAILEY...

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:15.003
          GOOD GIRL.

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:16.004
    WATCH YOUR HEAD, ADAM.

01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:18.974
DON'T JUST LEAVE,
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:21.543
    I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
       THERE IS TO SAY.

01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:23.611
  LISTEN, YOU BASICALLY THINK

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.313
      THAT MY PRIORITIES
     ARE ALL OUT OF WHACK,

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.483
      BUT YOU'RE MISSING
       WHAT MAKES ME ME.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:29.918
       NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.052
 I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS,
    AND IT'S FINE, REALLY.

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:32.620
            "FINE?"

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:34.322
   "FINE" IS LIKE SOMETHING
  YOU SAY ABOUT THE WEATHER.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.758
  IT'S NOT HOW YOU TALK ABOUT
    SOMEONE THAT YOU LOVE.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.827
        BAILEY, JUST...

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:41.997
     PLEASE, JUST TELL ME
        WHAT YOU WANT.

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:47.736
        I WANT SHIRLEY.

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:50.271
WHAT?

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:51.506
               COME HERE, GIRL.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:52.674
YOU CAN'T JUST
 TAKE SHIRLEY.

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:57.178
        YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT
        YOU GOT HER ONLY FOR ME.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.315
     BESIDES, NO DOG SHOULD LIVE
     WHERE THEY'RE NOT WELCOME.

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:12.160
      ERIC. WHY DIDN'T HE
         JUST TELL ME

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:14.062
   THAT HE DIDN'T WANT A DOG
      IN THE FIRST PLACE?

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:15.830
    IT WOULD HAVE SAVED US
   SO MUCH TIME AND TROUBLE.

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:16.865
I THINK HE DID,

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.033
JUST NOT IN A WAY
YOU WERE HEARING.

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:19.000

01:07:19.002 --> 01:07:20.568
          TO BE FAIR,

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.337
        I HAVEN'T BEEN
  COMPLETELY HONEST WITH HIM.

01:07:22.339 --> 01:07:26.741
    I SAID "YES" TO GETTING
            MARRIED
     WHEN I REALLY MEANT,
           "MAYBE."

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:28.276
     WELL, NOW THAT WE'RE
 ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS,

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:29.477
         WHY DID YOU?

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:31.179
     BECAUSE MEN LIKE ERIC
     DON'T GROW ON TREES.

01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:33.114
    I THINK WE CAN AGREE ON
             THAT.

01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:34.049
     NO OFFENSE TO TRAVIS.

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:35.817
          NONE TAKEN.

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:37.018
         I WISH TRAVIS
  HAD HALF OF ERIC'S INTEREST

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.820
         IN MARRIAGE.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:40.088
     THERE IS SUCH A THING

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:40.889
          AS TOO MUCH
  OF A GOOD THING, YOU KNOW.

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:43.058
 YOU KNOW, ON OUR FIRST DATE,

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.760
    WHEN ERIC BROUGHT THOSE
           PICTURES
  OF THE PERFECT GOLF SWING,

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:47.695
       I THOUGHT, "LOOK,
 THIS GUY IS SUPER-PREPARED."

GOOD.

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:53.601

        A DEAL-BREAKER.

         JUST KEEP IT IN CHECK.

      OF A GOOD THING...
