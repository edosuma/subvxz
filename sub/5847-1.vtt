Hurry up.

00:36.555 --> 00:38.722
It's floored. I'm going
as fast as I can.

00:38.723 --> 00:40.892
You've got to go faster, man!

00:49.234 --> 00:51.403
It's not slowing down.

00:51.404 --> 00:53.404
<i>I know.</i>

00:53.405 --> 00:57.208
<i>Go! Come on!</i>

00:57.209 --> 00:58.809
Faster!

00:58.810 --> 01:00.912
We're running out of lake.

01:04.550 --> 01:06.035
<i>Faster!</i>

01:06.036 --> 01:07.485
Come on!

01:07.486 --> 01:11.157
<i>We're going to have to beach
it. Get ready to jump!</i>

01:12.825 --> 01:14.926
<i>We're not going to make it!</i>

<i>Jingle bells,
your breath smells</i>

01:45.791 --> 01:47.791
<i>Why don't you Leave work?</i>

01:47.792 --> 01:49.728
<i>If you keep staring
at your screen</i>

01:49.729 --> 01:52.197
<i># You'll turn into a jerk #</i>

01:54.033 --> 01:55.032
Very funny.

01:55.033 --> 01:57.002
Thank you.

01:57.003 --> 01:58.903
So did you sleep here
last night or...

01:58.904 --> 02:02.474
No.

02:02.475 --> 02:04.475
You were wearing this yesterday.

02:04.476 --> 02:06.577
Yeah, okay. Look at this.
This is something.

02:06.578 --> 02:07.774
I'm telling you, check that out.

02:07.775 --> 02:10.314
Yes, it is an asteroid.

02:10.315 --> 02:12.984
We've been tracking that for weeks.
It's the size of this desk.

02:12.985 --> 02:15.487
It's not going to survive the
burn up through our atmosphere

02:15.488 --> 02:17.689
just like hundreds of
millions before it.

02:17.690 --> 02:20.358
Yeah, but this flaring right here,
that's a temperature shift.

02:20.359 --> 02:21.444
How do you explain that?

02:21.445 --> 02:22.494
It's Santa's sleigh.

02:22.495 --> 02:24.149
<i>My God, that is Santa's sleigh.</i>

02:24.150 --> 02:26.200
You discovered Santa's sleigh.

02:26.201 --> 02:28.299
I'm serious, Neil,
this is not normal.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.701
Neither is
working over Christmas.

02:29.702 --> 02:32.304
Come on, let's go.

02:32.305 --> 02:35.306
Can't I stay? I mean, my
parents are in Hong Kong.

02:35.307 --> 02:37.441
I'm going to my aunt's tomorrow.
I hate my aunt.

02:37.442 --> 02:38.633
Just give me the keys
and I'll lock up.

02:38.634 --> 02:40.612
Alex, it's Christmas.

02:40.613 --> 02:42.647
You don't get
extra credit for staying.

02:42.648 --> 02:44.882
I'm not asking for it. I just
want more time with this.

02:44.883 --> 02:46.299
I just want to
see it through entry.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.585
Okay, fine. Suit yourself.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.788
But I'm telling you, it's going
to burn up into nothing.

02:50.789 --> 02:52.691
You get a lump of
coal for Christmas.

02:52.692 --> 02:55.601
-Okay, a bah humbug to you.
-Unbelievable.

02:55.960 --> 02:59.797
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

03:02.001 --> 03:07.038
What a dork.
Okay.

03:27.425 --> 03:30.494
What the hell?

03:31.663 --> 03:33.631
Yes!

03:33.632 --> 03:36.669
That worked out
pretty damn well, didn't it?

03:37.669 --> 03:39.137
Hey, moron twins.

03:39.138 --> 03:40.804
What the hell are
you guys doing?

03:40.805 --> 03:42.607
How many times have I told you

03:42.608 --> 03:44.909
that dynamite is
for avalanche control?

03:44.910 --> 03:47.144
It's not a toy.

03:47.145 --> 03:48.780
Knuckleheads.

03:48.781 --> 03:51.649
I mean, he made me do it, so.

03:51.650 --> 03:52.883
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.685
Man...

03:54.686 --> 03:57.422
It's a holiday, all right?

03:57.423 --> 03:58.989
Look around, there's
nobody here,

03:58.990 --> 04:00.558
TJ and I were just
having a bit of fun.

04:00.559 --> 04:02.861
Really? Fun?
With dynamite?

04:02.862 --> 04:05.863
You keep playing with that stuff
you're going to take an arm off.

04:05.864 --> 04:07.899
Then what's your
mom going to say?

04:07.900 --> 04:10.435
She'd probably just
blame you like she always does.

04:10.436 --> 04:12.904
Exactly. So, you
want to blow your arm off,

04:12.905 --> 04:14.773
then you do it on her
weekend, not mine.

04:14.774 --> 04:16.774
Sorry, Dad, we were
just a little bored.

04:16.774 --> 04:19.442
Really? Did you fix that lift
kit I told you to fix?

04:19.444 --> 04:22.579
Yes, I did it like
two hours ago.

04:22.580 --> 04:25.917
All right, well, good.

04:27.652 --> 04:30.721
Mr. Ratchet, we were
hoping to go downtown,

04:30.722 --> 04:32.856
meet some friends, go to the,

04:32.857 --> 04:33.975
you know, Christmas thing.

04:33.976 --> 04:35.058
Yeah, yeah. I know about it.

04:35.059 --> 04:37.060
Forgive me if I don't
want to listen to Ben Crooge

04:37.061 --> 04:39.197
spout off about what a damned
philanthropist he is.

04:39.198 --> 04:41.433
Everyone seems to think
that expanding the resort

04:41.434 --> 04:43.968
might bring more
business. Be good for the town.

04:43.969 --> 04:46.171
Son, everything comes at a cost.

04:46.172 --> 04:48.772
Ben doesn't seem to be
taking that into account these days.

04:48.773 --> 04:50.974
-Yet you still work for him.
-I do.

04:50.975 --> 04:53.577
It doesn't mean I blindly
support everything he does.

04:53.578 --> 04:55.647
This isn't right. Not this way.

04:55.648 --> 04:58.730
Hey, it is a Christmas
celebration.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.084
I agree with this.

05:00.085 --> 05:01.886
-I could go for some celebration.
-I could celebrate.

05:01.887 --> 05:04.688
You could celebrate, I could celebrate,
you could celebrate.

05:04.689 --> 05:06.557
Enough.

05:07.492 --> 05:08.993
Then you got to
go to your mother's.

05:08.994 --> 05:11.696
Yeah, it is her year.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.634
Tell you what. I'll
give you a ride into town.

05:16.635 --> 05:18.804
I got to pick up some
supplies anyway.

05:19.504 --> 05:21.772
Nice.

05:21.773 --> 05:23.173
Kind father. He's a good man.

05:23.174 --> 05:25.511
-The best.
-Yeah.

05:37.722 --> 05:40.124
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

05:48.566 --> 05:51.569
<i>Merry Christmas, everybody!</i>

05:52.938 --> 05:57.876
<i>Merry Christmas, everyone!</i>

05:58.143 --> 06:02.180
Happy Holidays!

06:02.181 --> 06:05.283
Looks like Santa puked all
over the mayor's car.

06:05.284 --> 06:09.654
-What do you expect?
-Yeah. Pretty much that.

06:09.655 --> 06:11.556
See you around, Dad.

06:12.624 --> 06:15.626
This place is a circus,
once again.

06:17.796 --> 06:19.964
What she sees in you
I have no idea.

06:19.965 --> 06:23.073
-It must be my winning personality.
-Well, it's definitely not your looks.

06:23.074 --> 06:24.668
Very funny.

06:24.669 --> 06:26.870
Hey, better watch
out for Mr. Crooge.

06:26.871 --> 06:29.307
<i>He loves employees
chasing after his daughter, right?</i>

06:29.308 --> 06:31.308
Well, you see I don't
actually work for him.

06:31.309 --> 06:35.312
-My dad does.
-I think that makes it worse.

06:35.313 --> 06:37.515
Probably. Yeah.

06:39.684 --> 06:41.952
See you around.

06:41.953 --> 06:44.688
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

06:44.689 --> 06:47.258
Merry Christmas!

06:49.561 --> 06:51.796
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

06:51.797 --> 06:53.264
Saint Nick.

06:53.265 --> 06:55.567
Charlie, Merry Christmas!

06:55.568 --> 06:57.235
You're looking very jolly.

06:57.236 --> 06:59.002
I thought you
weren't coming in for this.

06:59.003 --> 07:02.173
Me? Well, I've got
a good excuse.

07:02.174 --> 07:04.808
<i>He's still signing my paychecks.</i>

07:04.809 --> 07:08.211
-What are you doing?
-Celebrating the holidays.

07:08.212 --> 07:10.113
I see that.

07:10.114 --> 07:12.784
This fake snow is a nice touch.

07:12.785 --> 07:15.286
<i>Yeah. Global
warming is that way it is.</i>

07:15.287 --> 07:18.722
We'll be lucky if this town
ever sees a white Christmas again.

07:19.691 --> 07:23.627
-How are you holding up?
-Fake it till you make it, right?

07:23.628 --> 07:24.995
Don't worry about me, Charlie.

07:24.996 --> 07:27.197
I'll be okay.

07:27.198 --> 07:31.035
He can take my store,
but he can't take my spirit.

07:36.975 --> 07:39.344
-Come on.
-We have to make this quick.

07:39.345 --> 07:41.681
If I miss my dad's thing,
he'll kill me.

07:41.682 --> 07:42.716
Okay.

07:44.650 --> 07:47.918
And if he saw that,
he'd kill both of us.

07:47.919 --> 07:50.288
Well, see, your father
is one thing,

07:50.289 --> 07:52.757
that brother of yours, I
really think he's onto us.

07:52.758 --> 07:54.392
You're paranoid.

07:54.393 --> 07:57.696
Look, I don't want
to hide anymore, Marley.

08:00.866 --> 08:02.868
I know.

08:07.672 --> 08:10.375
I wish things were different.

08:10.376 --> 08:13.211
Good to see you.

08:13.212 --> 08:16.813
Scott, where is that
sister of yours? We have to start.

08:16.814 --> 08:19.916
How should I know? Is it my turn
to put on her radio collar?

08:19.917 --> 08:22.987
Maybe try giving her a call?

08:24.088 --> 08:26.958
Do we have to do this now?

08:27.258 --> 08:29.793
No. No, we don't.

08:29.794 --> 08:33.857
But we do have to
do this right now.

08:33.857 --> 08:35.328
Merry Christmas, Marley.

08:35.330 --> 08:36.700
But I didn't bring your present.

08:36.701 --> 08:38.769
That's okay, just open it.

08:38.770 --> 08:41.840
And keep in mind I wanted
it to be bigger, obviously.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.308
My God.

08:44.309 --> 08:45.843
It's a diamond.

08:45.844 --> 08:48.146
Barely, but you know,

08:48.147 --> 08:52.017
I saved up for it, so
I hope you like it.

08:56.422 --> 08:59.890
-Tim, I love it.
-Good.

09:03.394 --> 09:05.228
They're trying
to get a hold of me.

09:05.229 --> 09:08.232
Sure they are.

09:08.233 --> 09:12.771
Hey look, is
that a shooting star?

09:15.941 --> 09:18.376
<i>Hi, you've reached
Marley. Please leave me a message.</i>

09:18.377 --> 09:20.445
She's not answering.

09:20.446 --> 09:24.950
Well, forget it. We have
to do without her.

09:28.019 --> 09:30.887
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

09:30.888 --> 09:32.790
<i>We are here today</i>

09:32.791 --> 09:36.794
to break ground on a brand
new retail complex.

09:36.795 --> 09:38.329
<i>Now, in doing this,</i>

09:38.330 --> 09:40.363
we should also say
our thank yous

09:40.364 --> 09:43.935
and our goodbyes to
all these stores around us.

09:43.936 --> 09:44.969
Yeah, right.

09:44.970 --> 09:48.440
<i>We honor the role they've played
in our town's history.</i>

09:50.242 --> 09:53.276
<i>It's an exciting
time for our town.</i>

09:53.277 --> 09:57.415
<i>We've already begun
construction on Lakeview Mountain.</i>

09:57.416 --> 09:59.146
<i>What is that?</i>

10:02.955 --> 10:03.909
My God.

10:03.910 --> 10:05.055
Come on, we need to go.

10:05.056 --> 10:08.459
This marks a new beginning
for Lennox,

10:08.460 --> 10:12.330
<i>finally bringing us into
the 21st century.</i>

10:13.132 --> 10:15.700
<i>Prosperity is coming to Lennox.</i>

10:17.902 --> 10:20.071
Everybody look out.

10:58.944 --> 11:01.012
<i>TJ.</i>

11:15.393 --> 11:17.295
Neil, it's me. It hit.

11:17.296 --> 11:19.564
In Lennox, 80 miles
northeast of Olympia.

11:19.565 --> 11:22.266
I'm heading there now.

11:22.267 --> 11:25.537
If you get bored of singing
Christmas carols, you know where to find me.

11:39.417 --> 11:42.087
Get on the phone
to Governor Michaels.

11:42.088 --> 11:43.122
Okay.

11:44.288 --> 11:47.225
Crystal? Crystal, you okay?

11:53.231 --> 11:57.935
You guys, take your
mom to the bowling alley.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.140
Are you okay? You sure?

12:03.141 --> 12:05.377
There's an
ambulance right there.

12:06.210 --> 12:08.879
Miles. Miles, get up.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.214
What the hell was that?

12:10.215 --> 12:12.349
I have no idea.

12:12.350 --> 12:14.985
You good? Can you stand?
I need your help.

12:14.986 --> 12:17.054
There's a lot injured, we got
to get them out of here.

12:17.055 --> 12:19.357
-You up to it?
-Okay, yeah, go.

12:30.502 --> 12:35.006
-Is it on fire?
-No, it's freezing.

12:37.441 --> 12:39.510
Is he alive?

12:42.047 --> 12:44.081
I don't think so.

12:49.553 --> 12:52.123
What the...

12:52.124 --> 12:55.158
Ben! Help me.
My hands are stuck.

12:55.159 --> 12:57.328
<i>What the...</i>

12:57.329 --> 12:59.263
Ben. Help me, please.

13:01.399 --> 13:04.234
Ben! Please, help me!

13:19.584 --> 13:21.651
Miles!

13:21.652 --> 13:23.989
Miles.

13:29.594 --> 13:32.363
Tell the Governor this is way bigger
than anything we can handle.

13:32.364 --> 13:34.999
We need some help out here.

13:42.606 --> 13:45.075
Wait, wait, wait!

13:52.249 --> 13:54.118
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

13:54.119 --> 13:55.071
<i>Marley.</i>

13:55.072 --> 13:55.987
Mom!

13:55.988 --> 13:58.023
<i>God.</i>

13:58.190 --> 13:59.724
I'm so sorry!

13:59.725 --> 14:01.293
Scott, you seen my dad around?

14:01.294 --> 14:02.328
Yeah.

14:02.561 --> 14:04.462
Scott!

14:04.463 --> 14:07.198
Scott, what's wrong with you?

14:07.872 --> 14:09.951
Hey, enough. Enough.

14:09.952 --> 14:10.942
<i>What is going on?</i>

14:10.943 --> 14:12.302
Why don't you ask your daughter?

14:12.303 --> 14:14.571
Enough.

14:14.572 --> 14:17.041
Now, folks, listen up.

14:17.042 --> 14:20.143
Listen, I just got off the phone
with the governor's office.

14:20.144 --> 14:22.445
Now, we've cordoned off
the area where the meteor hit.

14:22.446 --> 14:25.215
Do not approach it.

14:25.216 --> 14:27.450
I want you to go home
and stay there.

14:27.451 --> 14:30.286
And if you live downtown,

14:30.287 --> 14:33.556
you stay with a friend or
a family member, all right?

14:33.557 --> 14:36.093
Thank you.

14:38.162 --> 14:39.696
<i>Dad.</i>

14:39.697 --> 14:41.498
I was so worried.

14:41.499 --> 14:43.634
Tim.

14:43.768 --> 14:47.304
-You okay?
-Yeah, it's fine.

14:47.305 --> 14:49.507
What happened? Let
me look at you.

14:49.508 --> 14:52.575
-What hit you?
-Scott Crooge.

14:52.576 --> 14:55.378
You want to know
where Marley was?

14:55.379 --> 14:57.982
<i>She was
sneaking around with him.</i>

14:58.649 --> 14:59.783
<i>Is that true?</i>

14:59.784 --> 15:01.518
Yeah.

15:01.519 --> 15:03.219
We'll talk about this later.

15:03.220 --> 15:05.623
<i>Go home. All of you.</i>

15:05.624 --> 15:08.459
Now!

15:11.329 --> 15:13.597
You go home, too.

15:13.598 --> 15:15.532
Call your mother. Tell her what
happened and that you'll be late.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.100
I'll meet you at the house.

15:17.101 --> 15:19.036
Be safe.

15:26.310 --> 15:27.658
It's getting worse.

15:27.659 --> 15:29.249
Why aren't you
leaving with the rest of them?

15:29.250 --> 15:30.957
Taking that son of yours home.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.315
I'm here to help.

15:32.316 --> 15:34.618
We don't need you. The
mayor put calls in.

15:34.619 --> 15:36.686
The cavalry should
be here any minute.

15:36.687 --> 15:38.722
Ben, I'm not
working for you right now.

15:38.723 --> 15:41.658
I'm here to help
the people of this town.

15:41.659 --> 15:43.460
Something you lost sight
of a long time ago.

15:43.461 --> 15:47.597
Well, now you're not
working for me at all.

15:50.335 --> 15:55.339
Really? You think that
matters right now?

15:56.307 --> 15:57.259
State troopers are here.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.175
You need to warn them.

15:58.176 --> 16:00.110
They have no idea
what they're walking into.

16:00.111 --> 16:02.446
What are you doing? Charlie.

16:15.259 --> 16:17.560
<i>Heard you had a meteor strike.
How cool is that?</i>

16:17.561 --> 16:20.598
Well, people are
dead, so not very.

16:20.599 --> 16:21.756
You got experience with
this kind of thing?

16:21.757 --> 16:24.200
Experience? What do you mean?

16:24.201 --> 16:26.603
Something is down there. I don't
know what it is, but it's not stopping.

16:26.604 --> 16:29.172
Look, we're the
closest division.

16:29.173 --> 16:31.775
It takes time to pull together
all the resources to get a full squad.

16:31.776 --> 16:33.710
We got this.

16:33.711 --> 16:36.080
I wouldn't go there
if I were you.

16:43.721 --> 16:46.289
It seems to be okay to me.

16:46.423 --> 16:50.194
-Get out of there!
-What the hell is that?

16:56.433 --> 16:58.768
Come on, Gibbons.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.638
Keep going.

17:03.175 --> 17:05.143
Get in here.

17:30.267 --> 17:33.237
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

17:37.873 --> 17:41.468
-Do you think it's over?
-I don't even know what it is.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.281
<i>Let me in! It's me.</i>

17:44.282 --> 17:46.684
Get the door.

17:50.688 --> 17:53.190
A little help would be nice.

17:56.561 --> 17:58.762
<i>What the hell is this, Charlie?</i>

17:58.763 --> 18:01.665
Damned if I know, but it's a hell
of a lot more than just a meteor storm.

18:01.666 --> 18:03.997
Yeah, no kidding.
Did you see that storm?

18:03.998 --> 18:05.012
We all saw it.

18:05.013 --> 18:07.838
We need to get everybody out
of town. Send them over to Tannen.

18:07.839 --> 18:10.640
<i>He's right. None of us is
equipped to deal with this.</i>

18:10.641 --> 18:13.877
I'll call Faye, see if she can take
some at the community center.

18:13.878 --> 18:16.813
Tell her to get
whatever resources she needs.

18:16.814 --> 18:19.316
I'll cover the expense.

18:19.451 --> 18:21.819
Okay.

18:34.832 --> 18:36.900
<i>Need some help over here.</i>

18:58.622 --> 19:00.323
<i>So yeah, we can move
that to Monday,</i>

19:00.324 --> 19:01.791
<i>that frees up Tuesday.</i>

19:01.792 --> 19:03.961
<i>Excuse me.</i>

19:03.962 --> 19:06.062
Faye, Charlie's on the line
for you. He says it's urgent.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.398
You got that?

19:08.399 --> 19:10.868
Excuse me.

19:13.638 --> 19:15.339
Are you okay? Is Tim okay?

19:15.340 --> 19:16.405
He didn't call you?

19:16.406 --> 19:17.541
<i>No.</i>

19:17.542 --> 19:19.443
And I've tried calling
but I can't get through.

19:19.444 --> 19:21.412
<i>All right, look, I'm
sure he's fine.</i>

19:21.413 --> 19:22.879
<i>Listen, the mayor
is evacuating town.</i>

19:22.880 --> 19:25.349
Everyone? What's going
on out there?

19:25.350 --> 19:27.650
A meteor hit in the center
of Main Street.

19:27.651 --> 19:30.788
<i>It's total chaos over here.
We need to evacuate.</i>

19:30.789 --> 19:32.691
Can you make room
for us over there?

19:32.692 --> 19:34.558
Of course. I'll
make the preparations.

19:34.559 --> 19:37.895
<i>All right, thanks. And Ben said he'd
take care of any extra expenses.</i>

19:37.896 --> 19:39.231
Really?

19:39.232 --> 19:40.093
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:40.094 --> 19:41.393
When should I expect you?

19:41.394 --> 19:44.068
I'll start sending folks
over immediately.

19:44.069 --> 19:47.370
I take it that means you
won't be with them.

19:47.371 --> 19:49.906
I'm going to stay here, make
sure nobody gets left behind.

19:49.907 --> 19:50.859
Charlie.

19:50.860 --> 19:51.774
<i>Faye.</i>

19:51.775 --> 19:53.609
Come on,
somebody's got to do it.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.877
<i>It doesn't
always have to be you.</i>

19:54.878 --> 19:58.014
Just be careful, okay?

19:58.015 --> 20:00.083
You know I will.

20:00.084 --> 20:01.069
See you soon.

20:01.070 --> 20:02.986
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

20:06.057 --> 20:08.692
I just talked to Faye. She said
she's going to get ready for us.

20:08.693 --> 20:10.627
I need you to take care of
the evac communications.

20:10.628 --> 20:13.629
Tell people to dress
warmly, bring food and bedding.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.800
-I'll be back soon.
-What? Wait.

20:16.801 --> 20:19.070
<i>Charlie.</i>

20:20.003 --> 20:22.539
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

20:22.540 --> 20:24.608
It'll take us a while to get
these wounded out of here

20:24.609 --> 20:26.510
and the back-up
generator is about to go out.

20:26.511 --> 20:28.846
I got to get
home, grab my tools,

20:28.847 --> 20:32.617
keep the lights and the heat on until
we can get them out of here.

20:52.102 --> 20:54.704
Tim.

20:54.705 --> 20:56.473
<i>What are you doing?</i>

20:56.474 --> 21:00.644
-Hey, did you call your mother?
-I tried, the phone lines are down.

21:00.645 --> 21:02.913
Internet and cable, too.

21:02.914 --> 21:05.416
Honestly, we're
lucky we even have power.

21:05.417 --> 21:08.484
Everybody's being evacuated to Tannen
until we can figure this out.

21:08.485 --> 21:10.395
-You should get going.
-What about you?

21:10.396 --> 21:11.985
What are you packing for?

21:11.986 --> 21:14.457
Ben and Mayor Gibbons
are over at the clinic.

21:14.458 --> 21:16.159
<i>There's a lot of wounded and
their power is failing.</i>

21:16.160 --> 21:19.562
I'm going to see if I can
keep the generator running.

21:19.563 --> 21:23.633
Here. You should gear up. It's
getting cold out there.

21:24.436 --> 21:26.904
Was TJ at the clinic, Dad?

21:26.905 --> 21:31.075
<i>I stopped by his house on the
way here. He wasn't there.</i>

21:31.542 --> 21:33.042
No.

21:33.043 --> 21:36.179
No, he wasn't.

21:36.180 --> 21:37.915
<i>Look,
everybody's being evacuated.</i>

21:37.916 --> 21:40.385
You need to get out of here.

21:42.887 --> 21:45.822
Tim, now.

21:46.757 --> 21:49.560
I saw that
thing come down on us.

21:49.561 --> 21:52.829
The meteor.

21:52.830 --> 21:56.066
It split into two, changed colors.
It was the craziest thing.

21:56.067 --> 21:59.002
What do you mean split into
two and changed colors?

21:59.003 --> 22:00.971
I didn't see that.

22:00.972 --> 22:02.829
Where did the other part land?

22:02.830 --> 22:03.807
I don't know.

22:03.808 --> 22:07.543
It was headed towards
Mount Dickens, though.

22:07.544 --> 22:10.981
That's far away from civilization.
That's a good sign.

22:12.649 --> 22:14.851
Hey, Tim.

22:14.852 --> 22:17.687
You can talk to me about anything.
You know that, right?

22:17.688 --> 22:21.258
-Even if you don't think I approve.
-Okay.

22:21.259 --> 22:24.528
You know that dent
on the back of your car?

22:24.529 --> 22:26.929
-That was me.
-Very funny.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.531
You know, Dad, you can stand up

22:28.532 --> 22:32.836
-to Ben Crooge just a little bit.
-Is that so?

22:32.837 --> 22:36.572
Well, I did
today, and I got fired.

22:36.573 --> 22:40.944
-Okay, very funny.
-I'm not kidding.

22:40.945 --> 22:43.981
Look, your mom's waiting for you.
You should get out of here.

22:45.215 --> 22:49.118
I won't be far behind you.
Don't worry about me.

22:49.119 --> 22:52.590
For luck.

22:53.123 --> 22:55.625
Merry Christmas, kid.

22:57.928 --> 23:00.598
Hurry up.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.740
<i>I did it for your own good.</i>

23:09.741 --> 23:11.608
Screw off, Scott,
you're not my dad.

23:11.609 --> 23:13.878
Enough. Both of you.

23:15.079 --> 23:17.548
There will be
time to discuss this,

23:17.549 --> 23:20.050
but right now we are all going
to Tannen until they sort this out.

23:20.051 --> 23:21.652
<i>Grab your bags.
Marley, you'll ride with Scott.</i>

23:21.653 --> 23:23.119
-What?
-Why?

23:23.120 --> 23:25.022
Because you are brother
and sister,

23:25.023 --> 23:26.614
and one way or another you
are going to get along.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.135
What about you?

23:28.136 --> 23:31.995
I'm taking the Parsons.
Their car is in the shop.

23:51.215 --> 23:53.684
Move!

24:07.998 --> 24:10.300
What the hell was that?

24:12.936 --> 24:14.325
That's it.
We're all leaving now.

24:14.326 --> 24:15.120
Okay.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.807
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

24:28.186 --> 24:30.120
Hell.

24:35.959 --> 24:37.194
Get in!

24:37.195 --> 24:39.795
-What?
-Let's go. Move!

24:39.796 --> 24:42.198
<i>Get in the car now!</i>

24:43.734 --> 24:46.904
<i>Hurry!</i>

24:51.775 --> 24:54.144
Is that normal for around here?

24:54.145 --> 24:56.113
Nope.

25:00.017 --> 25:02.151
<i>It went the other way.</i>

25:02.887 --> 25:05.222
God.

25:16.367 --> 25:17.434
<i>Now what?</i>

25:17.435 --> 25:19.869
You like boats?

25:25.877 --> 25:27.845
Untie the boat.

25:28.279 --> 25:31.382
Come on.

25:32.350 --> 25:35.418
-It's coming, come on.
-I know.

25:35.419 --> 25:38.288
Hurry, let's go!

25:43.895 --> 25:46.030
-Go!
-Hold on.

25:51.769 --> 25:53.671
<i>Come on.</i>

25:57.708 --> 26:00.009
<i>How are we doing?</i>

26:00.977 --> 26:02.846
Hurry up.

26:02.847 --> 26:04.981
It's floored. I'm going
as fast as I can.

26:04.982 --> 26:07.218
Got to go faster, man.

26:15.426 --> 26:17.426
It's not slowing down.

26:17.427 --> 26:19.463
<i>I know.</i>

26:19.464 --> 26:21.865
<i>Go!</i>

26:21.866 --> 26:23.433
<i>Come on.</i>

26:23.434 --> 26:27.172
-Faster!
-I'm running out of lake.

26:30.841 --> 26:32.008
<i>Faster!</i>

26:32.009 --> 26:34.277
Come on!

26:34.278 --> 26:36.781
<i>We're going to have to beach it.</i>

26:37.948 --> 26:39.949
<i>We're not going to make it.</i>

26:45.156 --> 26:47.957
Hang on.

26:49.494 --> 26:51.829
Get ready to jump.

26:54.799 --> 26:56.734
Go!

26:57.435 --> 27:00.236
Go, come on, go, go!

27:07.110 --> 27:10.313
Ben. Something's happening
west of the lake.

27:11.248 --> 27:14.117
-Another meteor?
-I don't know.

27:14.118 --> 27:17.387
Listen, Stu Carson just came
in. He's covered in frost bite

27:17.388 --> 27:19.455
and he's screaming about
flash freezing.

27:19.456 --> 27:21.524
According to him,
Highway 10 is completely blocked

27:21.525 --> 27:24.961
with giant chunks of ice.

27:24.962 --> 27:28.898
I guess the idea of all this stopping
just went out the window.

27:28.899 --> 27:32.034
<i>I don't care if you have to put ten
people to a car, we need to evacuate.</i>

27:32.035 --> 27:34.870
The only way out of this town
now is the back roads.

27:34.871 --> 27:36.773
All right.

27:46.283 --> 27:50.119
-What happened back there?
-It's called a flash freeze.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.922
But I've only read accounts.

27:51.923 --> 27:55.090
I've never
experienced one in person.

27:55.091 --> 27:58.061
Well, I've seen quite a few
in the last couple of hours.

27:59.296 --> 28:01.197
Up this way.

28:06.070 --> 28:08.271
And none of this before
the meteor hit?

28:08.272 --> 28:11.474
Wait, no.

28:11.475 --> 28:13.577
How do you know
about the meteor?

28:13.578 --> 28:18.447
-Who exactly are you anyway?
-I'm Alex. Alex Novak.

28:18.448 --> 28:21.016
<i>I'm a grad student at the
university getting a PhD in astrophysics.</i>

28:21.017 --> 28:23.319
I was tracking that meteor.

28:24.288 --> 28:27.323
Charlie Ratchet.

28:27.324 --> 28:29.458
Nice to meet you.

28:29.459 --> 28:31.168
You sure picked a hell of a
way to spend your Christmas.

28:31.169 --> 28:32.981
I'd say.

28:32.982 --> 28:34.330
So, what happened back there?

28:34.331 --> 28:36.299
You've never seen anything
like that before?

28:36.300 --> 28:38.234
No. That's why if it
is linked to the meteor...

28:38.235 --> 28:41.338
Wait, what do you mean linked
to the meteor? How?

28:41.339 --> 28:43.906
It's so far away from here.

28:43.907 --> 28:47.977
If I'm right,
it's spreading. I mean...

28:47.978 --> 28:51.247
That's why I need to see the impact
crater as soon as possible.

28:53.618 --> 28:56.086
Well, I can take you
as far as the clinic.

28:56.087 --> 28:58.355
Last I knew the mayor was there.

28:58.356 --> 29:01.325
You and he can discuss
what you want to do from there.

29:07.231 --> 29:09.398
<i>Are you old
school or new school?</i>

29:09.399 --> 29:10.359
What?

29:10.360 --> 29:13.537
I think I know a way
we can make up some time.

29:14.638 --> 29:16.438
Let's go.

29:16.439 --> 29:19.376
Right behind you.

29:19.377 --> 29:22.646
What, they didn't teach you
how to snowboard in school, Novak?

29:22.647 --> 29:24.849
Just keep going!

29:52.676 --> 29:55.446
-Thank God you're okay.
-I'm fine.

29:56.213 --> 29:58.348
-Your lip.
-I tripped.

29:58.349 --> 30:00.516
It's nothing.

30:01.653 --> 30:02.738
Any news?

30:02.739 --> 30:05.155
No. Only that it's bad.

30:05.156 --> 30:08.191
-Dad's still out there, obviously.
-I'm aware.

30:08.192 --> 30:11.127
Mom, have you,

30:11.128 --> 30:14.964
you haven't happened to see Marley
Crooge around, have you?

30:14.965 --> 30:17.266
No, not yet.

30:17.267 --> 30:21.938
Hey, I need some man power.
Let's help unload.

30:22.173 --> 30:24.141
Sure thing.

30:25.141 --> 30:28.178
-Hey, how's it going?
-This is great.

30:28.179 --> 30:29.212
I got that.

30:29.213 --> 30:30.981
I just got a bunch
of boxes back here.

30:30.982 --> 30:33.450
Great, thanks.

30:33.451 --> 30:36.487
Hey, I'll be right back.

30:39.557 --> 30:41.458
Marley.

30:51.569 --> 30:54.539
-Here, I got that.
-Thanks.

30:57.742 --> 31:00.978
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

31:01.244 --> 31:03.179
Scott, stop it!

31:06.183 --> 31:07.416
What's your problem, buddy?

31:07.417 --> 31:09.452
You're blocking the road!

31:09.453 --> 31:11.955
Really?

31:13.290 --> 31:15.459
Scott, stop!

31:17.594 --> 31:20.696
-What is your problem?
-My truck's broken.

31:20.697 --> 31:25.435
-Can we give you a hand?
-That'd be great.

31:25.436 --> 31:28.739
Just go back to the car.
I'll deal with this.

31:31.175 --> 31:34.244
Hi. Sorry, what's
going on? What's the problem?

31:35.212 --> 31:36.976
Charlie, where the
heck have you been?

31:36.977 --> 31:41.250
We have got no phones, we've got a
little bit of power but the generator's bit...

31:42.653 --> 31:45.254
Who's this?

31:45.255 --> 31:47.089
I'm Alex Novak, from
the university.

31:47.090 --> 31:49.591
Did the governor send you?

31:49.592 --> 31:53.562
No, I was following the meteor
as part of my research project.

31:53.563 --> 31:56.765
Charlie, the generator is running
hot. Where's your tools?

31:56.766 --> 31:58.635
-I had to ditch them.
-Excuse me.

31:58.636 --> 32:01.137
I need to find the meteorite.
Where is it?

32:01.138 --> 32:02.704
<i>Middle of Main Street,
for all the good it'll do you.</i>

32:02.705 --> 32:05.608
-It's the eye of the storm.
-Okay, which direction?

32:05.609 --> 32:06.969
It's suicide
going back out there.

32:06.970 --> 32:08.055
Look, I'm going.

32:08.056 --> 32:10.379
This is obviously not your
garden variety meteor,

32:10.380 --> 32:12.247
and I'm going to need a sample.

32:12.248 --> 32:13.550
Thank you.

32:13.551 --> 32:15.717
<i>If it wasn't for you,</i>

32:15.718 --> 32:17.686
well, I think you know.

32:17.687 --> 32:20.556
I...

32:21.725 --> 32:23.560
I'm going to take this.

32:23.561 --> 32:26.295
Merry Christmas.

32:27.531 --> 32:29.433
All right guys, let's go.

32:31.368 --> 32:34.405
Come on. We can't just let
her go out there alone.

32:35.705 --> 32:37.608
Really?

32:38.475 --> 32:40.476
Nice.

32:41.411 --> 32:43.213
Keep this on channel five.

32:43.214 --> 32:44.848
Now, Charlie,
hold on a second now.

32:44.849 --> 32:46.849
We're almost
done evacuating here.

32:46.850 --> 32:48.056
When that last transport
leaves...

32:48.057 --> 32:52.722
-We're out of here.
-That's the Christmas spirit.

32:54.225 --> 32:56.192
Let's go ahead and
get the coolers

32:56.193 --> 32:57.760
and make sure there's plenty
of sandwiches, okay?

32:57.761 --> 33:00.164
Okay, thanks.

33:05.636 --> 33:07.369
Faye?

33:07.370 --> 33:09.672
Crystal.

33:09.673 --> 33:11.741
What you're doing is great.

33:11.742 --> 33:14.711
Thank you so
much for helping us.

33:18.616 --> 33:20.750
What's wrong?

33:20.751 --> 33:22.452
<i>I can't reach Marley or Scott.</i>

33:22.453 --> 33:24.820
<i>No one's seen them.</i>

33:24.821 --> 33:26.723
There's no cell reception.

33:26.724 --> 33:28.558
I saw Jim dropping
people off from the clinic.

33:28.559 --> 33:31.360
They're not there, either.

33:31.361 --> 33:32.649
I'm really worried, Faye.

33:32.650 --> 33:35.298
Hey, it's all
right. We'll find them.

33:35.299 --> 33:37.201
They should be here by now.

33:43.174 --> 33:44.807
This is crazy.

33:44.808 --> 33:46.943
I've been tracking this
meteor for weeks.

33:46.944 --> 33:49.378
Never in a million years did
I believe something like this

33:49.379 --> 33:51.214
would or even could happen.

33:51.215 --> 33:53.515
All the more reason
to stay away.

33:53.516 --> 33:55.585
I'm not asking
you to come with me.

33:55.586 --> 33:57.753
That thing has killed everybody
that's gotten near it.

33:57.754 --> 34:01.292
-It didn't kill you.
-Not yet.

34:23.813 --> 34:26.183
I don't think
it's such a good idea.

34:26.951 --> 34:29.918
I know.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.987
I just need to get
some readings.

34:32.989 --> 34:35.858
Does this area have
a history of tremors?

34:35.859 --> 34:40.596
No, it started with the impact.
Same as the ice storms.

34:44.802 --> 34:47.571
All right, we really need
to get out of here.

35:14.831 --> 35:16.399
-Easy there.
-Hi, Rob.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.001
Sorry, I just thought I...

35:18.002 --> 35:20.269
-What's wrong?
-Felt something.

35:20.270 --> 35:22.671
Have you seen Tim? I
don't know where he went off to.

35:22.672 --> 35:25.375
Yeah, I just saw
him head outside.

35:52.402 --> 35:53.970
Alex.

35:53.971 --> 35:55.071
Alex, you okay?

35:55.072 --> 35:57.407
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:59.610 --> 36:04.346
-You?
-I think so.

36:34.344 --> 36:36.979
Here, hold this.

36:36.980 --> 36:40.417
-Your leg.
-Yeah.

36:58.735 --> 37:02.004
Okay, look, this thing,

37:02.005 --> 37:04.807
whatever it is, this is
a major breakthrough.

37:04.808 --> 37:06.401
There's no precedent for
something like this.

37:06.402 --> 37:08.223
Yeah, well, I'm no astronomer,

37:08.224 --> 37:11.381
but I'm pretty sure the meteor isn't
supposed to change the weather.

37:11.382 --> 37:15.651
This meteorite, technically,
now that it's hit the ground,

37:15.652 --> 37:17.120
you're right.

37:17.121 --> 37:19.421
Where are we?

37:19.422 --> 37:21.823
<i>In the old mine
shaft underneath the town.</i>

37:21.824 --> 37:23.859
It's freezing down here.

37:23.860 --> 37:29.164
-Why is that?
-I think that meteorite is causing it.

37:29.165 --> 37:31.834
I think so, too.

37:31.835 --> 37:34.137
<i>It's amazing.</i>

37:34.138 --> 37:36.838
Scientists have
debated for years

37:36.839 --> 37:39.542
whether the water on Earth
originally came from the ice in meteors,

37:39.543 --> 37:43.079
but the Earth has so much water

37:43.080 --> 37:45.781
that hypothesis could
never be supported with evidence.

37:45.782 --> 37:49.651
But this, this is some
serious evidence.

37:49.652 --> 37:52.754
Well, congratulations.

37:52.755 --> 37:54.890
We're not climbing out of there.

37:54.891 --> 37:59.428
<i>I think if we go that way,</i>

37:59.429 --> 38:01.797
it'll take us back
to the clinic.

38:44.107 --> 38:46.676
Alex.

38:46.677 --> 38:49.413
Alex, you're
going the wrong way.

38:50.147 --> 38:53.049
She's just like my freaking kid.

39:17.107 --> 39:19.609
Are you kidding me?

39:19.610 --> 39:21.743
This is
unbelievable. I need a sample.

39:21.744 --> 39:24.046
Are you crazy?

39:24.047 --> 39:26.516
What do you mean?

39:29.853 --> 39:31.653
It's happening. We need
to get out of here.

39:31.654 --> 39:33.622
Let's move, come on!

39:35.893 --> 39:37.761
Take cover!

39:38.127 --> 39:40.729
Get down!

40:01.618 --> 40:04.621
Get inside, now!

40:15.031 --> 40:16.899
My God!

40:17.801 --> 40:19.735
Hey, did you feel that, man?

40:27.578 --> 40:30.046
<i>Okay, we got to get
going now. Okay? Now!</i>

40:30.047 --> 40:32.682
Chill!

40:33.049 --> 40:35.784
Scott!

40:44.962 --> 40:47.063
Run!

40:49.665 --> 40:50.999
Marley.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.203
Scott, run!

40:55.706 --> 40:56.705
<i>No!</i>

40:56.706 --> 40:58.707
No, Marley!

40:58.708 --> 41:01.076
Run! Run!

41:12.656 --> 41:15.659
Wait. Wait!

41:46.889 --> 41:48.891
Alex?

41:51.194 --> 41:54.263
-What happened?
-I don't know.

41:54.264 --> 41:55.798
We're still alive.

41:55.799 --> 41:58.168
Come on, let me help you up.

42:03.739 --> 42:05.641
Here, take this.

42:13.350 --> 42:17.385
I think these
lanterns may have saved us.

42:17.386 --> 42:21.256
I mean, as a heat
source. Look at the ground.

42:21.257 --> 42:23.688
<i>It's a giant circle.</i>

42:25.009 --> 42:26.750
No, it can't be that simple.

42:26.751 --> 42:29.898
<i>Sometimes the right
answer is the most obvious one.</i>

42:30.734 --> 42:32.936
You still want that sample?

42:33.302 --> 42:37.674
No. Let's go.

42:42.179 --> 42:45.180
And another one for
the hungry kids.

42:45.181 --> 42:47.216
There you go.

42:48.851 --> 42:50.952
Did you find Tim yet?

42:50.953 --> 42:52.888
He left.

42:52.889 --> 42:55.358
I think he went looking
for Marley.

42:57.427 --> 42:58.894
-Heli-skiing.
-What?

42:58.895 --> 43:01.230
Give me your phone.

43:02.732 --> 43:06.068
Ben bought a
heli-skiing company last summer.

43:09.973 --> 43:12.207
Cole? This is Crystal.

43:12.208 --> 43:16.045
I need you to drop
everything right now. I have a crisis.

43:22.918 --> 43:26.254
My God. My...

43:27.891 --> 43:32.228
Help! Help!

43:56.987 --> 44:00.255
Scott! Scott!

44:05.161 --> 44:07.796
Scott. Scott!

44:07.797 --> 44:10.265
My God. My...

44:10.266 --> 44:12.402
No.

44:12.435 --> 44:14.436
Scott!

44:15.572 --> 44:18.907
Ben, Mayor
Gibbons, do you copy? Over.

44:29.118 --> 44:32.788
<i>Ben, Mayor Gibbons, do you copy?</i>

44:36.458 --> 44:39.061
<i>Ben, do you copy? Over.</i>

45:24.507 --> 45:29.510
That meteorite is altering the entire
micro-climate of this area.

45:29.511 --> 45:31.914
So nothing like this has ever
been documented before?

45:31.915 --> 45:32.738
You've never seen
anything like this?

45:32.739 --> 45:35.084
Documented? No.

45:35.085 --> 45:37.419
I find that hard to believe.

45:37.420 --> 45:41.055
There's evidence of all sorts
of crazy stuff that doesn't add up.

45:41.056 --> 45:45.361
Our world has only been
scientifically aware for a few thousand years.

45:45.362 --> 45:50.164
Do you know what that amounts to
in a 4.5 billion-year-old planet?

45:50.165 --> 45:52.401
The blink of an eye.

45:52.402 --> 45:55.437
That's precisely
why I got into science.

45:55.438 --> 45:57.506
Well, we better get
you out of town

45:57.507 --> 45:59.575
or you're not
going to see graduation.

45:59.576 --> 46:01.376
If this keeps up,

46:01.377 --> 46:04.178
we're not going to make
it past Christmas.

46:04.179 --> 46:06.582
What the hell is that?

46:06.583 --> 46:09.552
<i>God, it looks like an igloo.</i>

46:13.022 --> 46:16.124
-Come with me.
-Where are we going?

46:16.125 --> 46:19.527
To do a little last minute
Christmas shopping.

46:23.266 --> 46:25.683
Cole, this is Faye Ratchet,
can you hear me?

46:25.684 --> 46:27.475
<i>Loud and clear, Faye.</i>

46:27.476 --> 46:32.140
<i>We're about five miles out keeping
our eyes peeled for any stranded people.</i>

46:32.141 --> 46:34.575
Highway 5 is blocked,
the passage is buried.

46:34.576 --> 46:36.711
<i>The only way out
of Lennox is on foot.</i>

46:36.712 --> 46:38.446
Can you see anything moving?

46:38.447 --> 46:40.448
<i>Cars? People?</i>

46:40.449 --> 46:42.984
<i>Not so far.</i>

46:42.985 --> 46:45.720
Me and Gary aren't exactly search
and rescue, but we'll do our best.

46:45.721 --> 46:48.222
Thank you. I can't tell
you how much this means to us.

46:48.223 --> 46:50.492
<i>Hey, no worries.</i>

46:50.493 --> 46:54.028
It wouldn't be Christmas
unless someone needed saving, right?

46:54.029 --> 46:56.397
Gary, let's split up.

46:56.398 --> 46:58.533
<i>I'll start with the
city limits and search south.</i>

46:58.534 --> 47:00.102
<i>You take
everything to the north.</i>

47:00.103 --> 47:03.039
Roger that, big
C. I'm on my way.

47:05.007 --> 47:07.409
Copy.

47:10.112 --> 47:12.915
<i>Scott!</i>

47:23.592 --> 47:25.995
Scott. Scott!

47:25.996 --> 47:27.396
No! God!

47:27.397 --> 47:28.463
My God!

47:28.464 --> 47:31.167
Scott!

47:32.368 --> 47:34.636
Scott.

47:38.141 --> 47:39.675
<i>Marley.</i>

47:39.676 --> 47:43.045
-Marley.
-My God, Tim.

47:44.179 --> 47:47.215
It's okay. It's all right.

47:57.127 --> 47:59.227
Come on, we have to
move. Come on, we have to go.

47:59.228 --> 48:02.497
Scott! No!

48:14.610 --> 48:17.145
You sure about this?

48:21.183 --> 48:23.252
Yeah.

48:46.775 --> 48:50.413
Ben, Mayor Gibbons,
do you read me? Over.

48:51.647 --> 48:54.149
Anybody copy? Over.

48:55.685 --> 48:57.719
Damn.

49:17.107 --> 49:20.076
We're too late.

50:03.319 --> 50:06.188
Ben?

50:08.257 --> 50:10.259
Are you okay?

50:11.261 --> 50:13.928
<i>No, Ben. It's not your fault.</i>

50:13.929 --> 50:15.439
Okay?

50:15.440 --> 50:21.404
-Come on, get up.
-I panicked, I ran inside here.

50:22.538 --> 50:24.740
And hid.

50:24.741 --> 50:27.342
I don't know why I lived.

50:28.411 --> 50:31.813
And I didn't save
him. I didn't save anyone.

50:33.183 --> 50:35.417
<i>What have I done?</i>

50:35.418 --> 50:37.686
Charlie...

50:39.755 --> 50:41.722
I closed the door on them.

50:41.723 --> 50:44.292
<i>I hid in the boiler room.</i>

50:44.293 --> 50:46.762
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

50:46.763 --> 50:49.363
It's okay. Ben, it's all right.

50:49.364 --> 50:51.234
It's okay.

50:52.268 --> 50:54.702
You'll be all
right. Let me help you up.

50:54.703 --> 50:56.839
Slowly. Come on.

50:57.507 --> 50:59.709
Let's get out of here.

51:11.721 --> 51:13.521
This is incredible.

51:13.522 --> 51:15.591
<i>It looks like the North Pole.</i>

51:15.592 --> 51:18.194
<i>It's an Arctic wasteland.</i>

51:20.330 --> 51:21.830
What do you mean?

51:21.831 --> 51:24.466
<i>There's nothing left.</i>

51:24.467 --> 51:26.301
<i>Snow and ice as
far as I can see.</i>

51:26.302 --> 51:29.338
<i>There's no buildings, no cars.</i>

51:29.339 --> 51:31.673
There's nothing.

51:31.674 --> 51:34.309
<i>Lennox is gone.</i>

51:34.310 --> 51:37.579
<i>Roger that, Cole. I haven't
found anyone either.</i>

51:37.580 --> 51:40.183
<i>I'll head towards town,
do another sweep.</i>

51:50.726 --> 51:52.327
Hey!

51:52.328 --> 51:53.762
-Over here.
-Hey.

51:53.763 --> 51:56.199
<i>We're down here.</i>

51:56.299 --> 51:57.531
Wait!

51:57.532 --> 51:58.867
They've got to see us.

51:58.868 --> 52:00.902
Hey!

52:06.375 --> 52:08.809
What the hell?

52:08.810 --> 52:10.544
<i>I'm looking at Dickens Peak.</i>

52:10.545 --> 52:13.314
<i>There's a whole
area that's untouched.</i>

52:13.315 --> 52:15.750
<i>There's no snow on it at all.</i>

52:16.552 --> 52:18.854
I'm going to check it out.

52:18.855 --> 52:20.821
-We're down here.
-Wait.

52:20.822 --> 52:23.759
We're here, please.

52:23.760 --> 52:23.828
Wait! Stop!

52:23.829 --> 52:26.996
-Stop!
-We got to move.

52:29.898 --> 52:32.301
Can anyone hear me?

52:32.302 --> 52:35.870
Hello? Great.

52:35.871 --> 52:37.553
We have to get out of
here, we have to get to Tannen.

52:37.554 --> 52:38.807
Maybe not.

52:38.808 --> 52:40.193
What are you thinking?

52:40.194 --> 52:41.542
What choice do we have?

52:41.543 --> 52:44.379
<i>No good choices. I'm just
trying to find the least crappy one.</i>

52:44.380 --> 52:46.647
I'm thinking there may
be a way to stop this thing.

52:46.648 --> 52:48.536
<i>No, we run, we get
as far away as possible.</i>

52:48.537 --> 52:50.718
Run where, Ben?

52:50.719 --> 52:53.055
<i>We have no idea how far this thing
is spreading or how fast.</i>

52:53.056 --> 52:54.990
If we have a chance
to stop it, it's now.

52:54.991 --> 52:58.894
I'm not absolute about this,
but heat, extreme heat,

52:58.895 --> 53:02.530
is a reactant.
That's been made clear.

53:02.531 --> 53:04.432
So if we can
produce enough heat...

53:04.433 --> 53:06.635
At the source of the impact,
We'd have a shot.

53:06.636 --> 53:09.004
<i>A shot at what? Killing
ourselves?</i>

53:09.005 --> 53:11.506
<i>It's about re-balancing nature.</i>

53:11.507 --> 53:13.608
A subatomic chain reaction
is taking place.

53:13.609 --> 53:16.410
It's not magic, it's science.

53:16.411 --> 53:18.013
<i>And it can be stopped if we can produce
enough heat at the source.</i>

53:18.014 --> 53:20.749
How about dynamite?

53:20.750 --> 53:22.194
Yeah, if there's enough, maybe.

53:22.195 --> 53:23.617
<i>Yeah, there's enough.</i>

53:23.618 --> 53:26.455
I sign the
invoices, I should know.

53:26.456 --> 53:27.858
Let's get to the resort.

53:27.859 --> 53:28.893
Yeah.

53:34.996 --> 53:36.866
Look.

53:54.016 --> 53:56.585
<i>Listen, I've covered
the whole area around town.</i>

53:56.586 --> 54:00.655
<i>I haven't seen
anyone. It's creepy, so...</i>

54:00.656 --> 54:03.124
I'm going to circle back to
the clinic building now.

54:03.125 --> 54:05.994
See if I can find anyone there.

54:19.842 --> 54:21.176
Do you hear that?

54:21.177 --> 54:22.943
Right there.

54:22.944 --> 54:24.446
Hey.

54:24.447 --> 54:25.747
Over here.

54:25.748 --> 54:28.384
Hey.

54:30.819 --> 54:32.787
<i>Yo, yo, yo. I got survivors.</i>

54:32.788 --> 54:34.890
<i>Three of them.</i>

54:34.891 --> 54:39.362
Two men, one
woman. I'm landing now.

54:40.596 --> 54:43.766
Awfully nice of you to arrange
transportation for us.

54:53.141 --> 54:56.078
Watch your step on the way down.

54:56.813 --> 54:59.548
Hey, Marley, come on.

54:59.549 --> 55:01.582
Get up.

55:01.583 --> 55:03.618
You're freezing.

55:08.458 --> 55:10.024
-We have to keep moving.
-No.

55:10.025 --> 55:11.559
Marley, we have to keep
moving. Come on.

55:11.560 --> 55:14.962
-Come on.
-Okay.

55:17.833 --> 55:19.935
<i>It's coming back.</i>

55:26.542 --> 55:28.578
-Come on.
-No.

55:31.647 --> 55:33.814
Wait, wait. I
think I see something.

55:33.815 --> 55:36.251
<i>It looks like two people
near Avery Wood.</i>

55:36.252 --> 55:37.785
<i>I'm going to head lower,
check it out.</i>

55:37.786 --> 55:39.588
Who is it? Can you
see who it is?

55:39.589 --> 55:42.558
<i>Not yet. Stand by.</i>

55:43.558 --> 55:45.860
Over here, over here. Come on.

55:47.196 --> 55:49.130
Look.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.970
Yeah, it looks like Tim
Ratchet and Marley.

55:54.971 --> 55:56.504
Crystal, come quick!

55:56.505 --> 55:59.039
-He saw us.
-Thank God.

55:59.040 --> 56:00.909
-Come on.
-Okay.

56:01.610 --> 56:03.879
They spotted Tim and Marley.

56:03.880 --> 56:06.280
<i>Boy, folks,
it's definitely them.</i>

56:06.281 --> 56:09.050
Christmas has
come early. Ho, ho, ho.

56:09.051 --> 56:11.619
<i>I'm setting her down.</i>

56:23.132 --> 56:25.000
My God.

56:25.301 --> 56:27.569
No!

56:30.973 --> 56:33.609
Gary.

56:34.810 --> 56:37.246
My God.

56:38.980 --> 56:40.982
Look out. Look out.

56:46.255 --> 56:47.722
<i>Gary.</i>

56:47.723 --> 56:49.858
<i>Come in, Gary.</i>

56:49.859 --> 56:52.795
<i>Gary, do you copy?</i>

56:54.196 --> 56:56.264
Gary.

57:01.136 --> 57:03.805
Gary.

57:05.708 --> 57:07.609
Cole, what's happening?

57:07.610 --> 57:10.345
Faye. Faye, is that you?

57:10.346 --> 57:11.608
Charlie?

57:11.609 --> 57:12.580
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

57:12.581 --> 57:14.316
Ben's here, too.

57:14.317 --> 57:16.785
Ben. Ben.

57:16.786 --> 57:18.787
Something happened.

57:18.788 --> 57:20.635
<i>Gary saw Tim and Marley
near Avery Wood,</i>

57:20.636 --> 57:22.823
<i>but then he yelled and...</i>

57:22.824 --> 57:24.658
We're heading that way.

57:24.659 --> 57:26.861
<i>Faye, I need
you to listen to me.</i>

57:26.862 --> 57:28.796
This thing is
spreading and it is cold.

57:28.797 --> 57:30.798
Arctic storm cold.

57:30.799 --> 57:33.033
<i>Barricade
yourselves inside. Build fires.</i>

57:33.034 --> 57:35.135
<i>Any heat source that can
survive a blackout.</i>

57:35.136 --> 57:37.738
Do not go outside.

57:37.739 --> 57:39.366
We have a plan to stop this.

57:39.367 --> 57:40.307
<i>We?</i>

57:40.308 --> 57:44.044
Ben, me, and Alex Novak,
an astrophysicist.

57:44.045 --> 57:47.916
<i>Faye, I'm serious.
Do not try to evacuate.</i>

57:47.917 --> 57:51.385
Build up as much heat as you possibly can
inside. That's your only protection.

57:51.386 --> 57:53.622
<i>I understand.</i>

57:53.623 --> 57:55.222
Charlie, the kids.

57:55.223 --> 57:57.692
Faye, I'll find them. I swear.

57:59.060 --> 58:01.729
We got this.

58:10.839 --> 58:12.006
Marley.

58:12.007 --> 58:14.342
Marley.

58:17.712 --> 58:19.146
Are you okay?

58:19.147 --> 58:21.149
My leg, it's stuck.

58:26.054 --> 58:30.259
God, I'm so cold.

58:35.364 --> 58:38.766
The helicopter, it's gone.

58:42.871 --> 58:45.140
Tim, it's over.

58:45.141 --> 58:47.142
We'll never make it out here.
We'll freeze to death.

58:47.143 --> 58:49.278
Just put this on.

58:50.446 --> 58:52.213
Get up.

58:52.214 --> 58:54.281
Look at me. Stamp your feet.

58:54.282 --> 58:57.718
Do anything to stay warm.
All right, trust me.

58:57.719 --> 58:59.421
Look at me. Look at me.

58:59.422 --> 59:01.321
We are going to make it, okay?

59:01.322 --> 59:03.758
We are going to make
it out of this, all right?

59:03.759 --> 59:07.428
We are. Just
think warm thoughts.

59:07.429 --> 59:09.132
I'm going to be right back.

59:09.133 --> 59:10.167
Where are you going?

59:13.134 --> 59:15.670
I'm going to go start a fire.

59:23.011 --> 59:24.812
I'll get the
radio in just a minute.

59:24.813 --> 59:26.314
I've got to go outside
and deal with something

59:26.315 --> 59:27.781
before they board this place up.

59:27.782 --> 59:30.718
Oops, here you go.

59:30.719 --> 59:32.454
<i>Faye.</i>

59:32.455 --> 59:34.789
-We're going to Billings.
-What?

59:34.790 --> 59:37.024
I've got a
four-wheel drive, We'll be okay.

59:37.025 --> 59:39.493
You don't understand.
Highway 5 is blocked, so is the pass.

59:39.494 --> 59:42.406
-There is no way out.
-We'll take our chances.

59:42.407 --> 59:43.964
Don't do this.

59:43.965 --> 59:46.401
Charlie said to stay inside.
He was adamant.

59:46.402 --> 59:49.903
Look, we made our decision.

59:49.904 --> 59:51.905
I know those roads
like the back of my hand.

59:51.906 --> 59:54.975
-We've got to get help.
-Rob, don't.

59:54.976 --> 59:59.246
Don't worry.
We'll be back with help.

01:00:15.998 --> 01:00:19.968
-See anything?
-No.

01:00:25.306 --> 01:00:26.441
Cole, what's wrong?

01:00:26.442 --> 01:00:28.843
The cold makes
everything a little bit sticky.

01:00:28.844 --> 01:00:31.813
Wait, over there on the right.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.501
Now all we need are
the chestnuts.

01:00:54.502 --> 01:00:56.204
I think I prefer some hot cocoa.

01:00:56.205 --> 01:00:59.840
With marshmallows.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:04.846
Did you hear something?

01:01:09.851 --> 01:01:13.288
Maybe it was just
Santa on a dry run.

01:01:26.435 --> 01:01:28.304
Everything's freezing up.

01:01:28.305 --> 01:01:29.089
What?

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:30.806
God.

01:01:33.208 --> 01:01:35.943
<i>We're going down. Everything's
freezing up.</i>

01:01:35.944 --> 01:01:38.046
Mayday. Mayday.
We're going down.

01:01:38.047 --> 01:01:42.584
Hello? Hello? Come on. Hello?

01:01:42.585 --> 01:01:47.588
<i>My latlong is north 45:47:12
west 1:08:32:14.</i>

01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:50.024
Brace yourselves.

01:02:10.045 --> 01:02:11.245
Tim?

01:02:11.246 --> 01:02:13.013
Yeah?

01:02:13.014 --> 01:02:15.917
Thank you.

01:02:15.918 --> 01:02:17.986
For coming back for me.

01:02:17.987 --> 01:02:19.653
Of course.

01:02:19.654 --> 01:02:23.057
I love you.

01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:25.994
I love you, too.

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:38.439
Marley, Tannen is right
over that pass.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.441
Okay, now, if we make it there, it's
hot cocoa for real. I promise.

01:02:41.442 --> 01:02:44.012
You're serious?

01:02:44.013 --> 01:02:47.148
We can't miss
Christmas morning, can we?

01:02:49.551 --> 01:02:51.485
Come on.

01:03:14.677 --> 01:03:16.912
Charlie?

01:03:20.181 --> 01:03:22.884
Is everybody okay?

01:03:29.725 --> 01:03:32.261
Cole.

01:03:35.297 --> 01:03:38.065
Cole.

01:03:56.217 --> 01:03:58.085
What about Cole?

01:03:59.188 --> 01:04:01.323
He's gone.

01:04:04.293 --> 01:04:07.095
We need to get out of here.

01:04:08.998 --> 01:04:10.083
You okay?

01:04:10.084 --> 01:04:12.100
Yeah.

01:04:34.489 --> 01:04:36.390
Hello? Ben?

01:04:36.391 --> 01:04:38.026
Cole?

01:04:38.027 --> 01:04:40.228
Hello? Ben?

01:04:53.241 --> 01:04:55.476
I can't see a thing.

01:04:57.446 --> 01:05:00.014
Come on.

01:05:16.397 --> 01:05:20.134
My God, look at that thing.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.676
We got to keep moving.

01:05:29.677 --> 01:05:32.513
The dynamite is that way and
Gary said that the kids went that way.

01:05:32.514 --> 01:05:34.548
So we got to split up.

01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:36.617
Well, I'm going to
destroy that thing.

01:05:36.618 --> 01:05:39.420
You're going to lose
your evidence.

01:05:40.255 --> 01:05:43.325
-I know.
-I'll go after the kids.

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:47.462
You're the
explosives expert, anyway.

01:05:54.536 --> 01:05:57.606
Try not to blow yourself up.

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:03.177
That's funny. It's what
I keep telling Tim.

01:06:05.647 --> 01:06:08.150
I'll see you guys in Tannen.

01:06:09.518 --> 01:06:11.184
Good luck.

01:06:11.185 --> 01:06:13.687
You, too.

01:06:17.159 --> 01:06:19.461
Let's go.

01:06:30.706 --> 01:06:33.740
Okay, good job guys.

01:06:33.741 --> 01:06:36.410
<i>Help, let us in.</i>

01:06:36.411 --> 01:06:37.163
Open it.

01:06:37.164 --> 01:06:37.879
<i>Okay.</i>

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.379
<i>Open up.</i>

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.481
Here he comes. Just a minute.

01:06:40.482 --> 01:06:42.384
Okay.

01:06:45.686 --> 01:06:48.589
<i>Crystal. Come quick.</i>

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:51.659
Crystal.

01:06:52.793 --> 01:06:55.196
Watch your step.

01:06:57.565 --> 01:06:59.467
Okay, here you go.

01:07:01.502 --> 01:07:03.937
Faye.

01:07:03.938 --> 01:07:07.508
Marley.

01:07:07.509 --> 01:07:11.312
My God, I was so worried.

01:07:11.313 --> 01:07:12.646
What happened?

01:07:12.647 --> 01:07:14.649
He saved me.

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:17.485
Tim saved me.

01:07:18.453 --> 01:07:21.422
Where's... Where's Scott?

01:07:21.822 --> 01:07:23.158
Mom.

01:07:23.159 --> 01:07:25.426
What?

01:07:30.565 --> 01:07:32.233
Where... Where's...

01:07:32.234 --> 01:07:33.533
Where...

01:07:33.534 --> 01:07:35.368
I'm sorry.

01:07:35.369 --> 01:07:38.305
No.

01:07:38.306 --> 01:07:40.574
I'm sorry.

01:07:42.411 --> 01:07:46.581
No. No.

01:07:58.726 --> 01:08:00.694
Scott!

01:08:02.397 --> 01:08:04.431
Marley.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.302
Tim.

01:08:12.907 --> 01:08:15.376
Well, I was hoping for
a white Christmas.

01:08:15.377 --> 01:08:16.977
Be careful what you wish for.

01:08:16.978 --> 01:08:19.313
Yeah, no kidding.

01:08:36.964 --> 01:08:39.033
What do you know about dynamite?

01:08:39.033 --> 01:08:41.969
Boom.

01:08:48.542 --> 01:08:51.246
Come on.

01:09:00.621 --> 01:09:02.756
Marley.

01:09:05.526 --> 01:09:08.295
Marley!

01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:27.549
Scott.

01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:49.904
Come on.

01:09:52.106 --> 01:09:55.542
I'm here.

01:10:14.562 --> 01:10:17.064
You're freezing. Let's
get you in front of the fire.

01:10:17.065 --> 01:10:18.899
Okay.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.936
Are you okay? Let's warm you up.

01:10:27.642 --> 01:10:32.014
-That sounded close.
-Yeah, come on.

01:10:32.015 --> 01:10:33.633
-Excuse us, guys.
-Sit here.

01:10:33.634 --> 01:10:35.350
Thank you.

01:10:54.602 --> 01:10:57.637
-We got to go.
-Not without my gear.

01:10:57.638 --> 01:10:58.873
Let's move. Leave it.

01:10:58.874 --> 01:11:00.742
Get on! Come on.

01:11:00.976 --> 01:11:03.044
Hang on.

01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:18.058
It's right behind us!

01:11:20.027 --> 01:11:22.163
Hand me a stick of dynamite.

01:11:22.164 --> 01:11:24.198
Here.

01:11:24.199 --> 01:11:25.632
Are you insane?

01:11:25.633 --> 01:11:28.502
Yes. Now, throw it.

01:11:34.575 --> 01:11:36.444
Did you see that?

01:11:36.445 --> 01:11:37.677
It knocked it back.

01:11:37.678 --> 01:11:39.681
Hang on.

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:44.619
Grab another one.

01:11:51.058 --> 01:11:54.278
-It's working.
-Yes.

01:12:03.004 --> 01:12:04.973
We've got this.

01:12:06.641 --> 01:12:09.076
Let's go blow up that meteorite.

01:12:10.212 --> 01:12:13.080
No!

01:12:14.115 --> 01:12:16.007
The dynamite. What do we do?

01:12:16.008 --> 01:12:18.502
We haul ass.

01:12:20.922 --> 01:12:23.490
<i>It's right behind us. We're
not going to make it.</i>

01:12:23.491 --> 01:12:24.958
What is that?

01:12:24.959 --> 01:12:27.462
<i>I don't know. Just go.</i>

01:12:27.728 --> 01:12:29.597
Hold on.

01:12:40.609 --> 01:12:42.576
Okay.

01:13:07.535 --> 01:13:10.837
Okay, now this is
a magic donkey.

01:13:10.838 --> 01:13:13.172
He is going to keep you safe.

01:13:13.173 --> 01:13:15.509
Okay?

01:13:28.722 --> 01:13:31.124
This is incredible.

01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:33.593
I've never seen
anything like this before.

01:13:33.594 --> 01:13:36.029
Yesterday, this entire area
was covered in snow,

01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:39.600
and the town was
green and now it's reversed.

01:13:39.601 --> 01:13:42.536
There's definitely something
crazy going on.

01:13:47.008 --> 01:13:48.844
Crap, Charlie, look at that.

01:13:48.845 --> 01:13:49.879
What?

01:13:52.914 --> 01:13:55.917
<i>Something is affecting
the storm.</i>

01:14:02.891 --> 01:14:04.026
The meteor.

01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:05.124
What about it?

01:14:05.125 --> 01:14:07.360
My son said he saw the meteor split
in two before it hit town.

01:14:07.361 --> 01:14:10.230
He said one of the pieces was
headed in this direction.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.035
Right.

01:14:14.803 --> 01:14:16.669
I saw this weird heat shift

01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:18.739
when I was tracking
the meteor through space.

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:21.842
One piece gives off
uncontrollable cold, the other heat.

01:14:21.843 --> 01:14:24.345
Together they make up a
normal meteor, but split them apart...

01:14:24.346 --> 01:14:26.946
We are screwed.

01:14:26.947 --> 01:14:29.551
We got to get them
back together again.

01:14:30.285 --> 01:14:32.554
What are you doing?

01:14:34.955 --> 01:14:37.124
I'm finding that missing piece.

01:14:56.844 --> 01:14:58.713
<i>Look.</i>

01:15:03.118 --> 01:15:05.285
We're trapped.

01:15:30.779 --> 01:15:33.880
That's a strange crater.

01:15:36.051 --> 01:15:38.217
If elves could show up on
flying reindeer right now,

01:15:38.218 --> 01:15:41.154
it would be the
strangest thing I'd seen today.

01:15:41.155 --> 01:15:42.273
Shouldn't we...

01:15:42.274 --> 01:15:43.356
Shouldn't we what?

01:15:43.357 --> 01:15:46.793
This isn't an archaeological expedition.
Let's get it and go.

01:15:48.429 --> 01:15:51.065
-Hot?
-Yeah, it's a little toasty.

01:15:54.302 --> 01:15:55.737
These gloves are heat resistant.

01:15:55.738 --> 01:15:57.136
That's more than a little heat.

01:15:57.137 --> 01:16:00.040
How are we
going to transport it?

01:16:04.344 --> 01:16:06.213
That should help.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.355
That's amazing.

01:16:47.755 --> 01:16:50.191
Take a look.

01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:04.004
It's okay.

01:17:09.076 --> 01:17:11.944
# Jingle bells Jingle bells #

01:17:11.945 --> 01:17:14.448
# Jingle all the way #

01:17:14.449 --> 01:17:17.284
# What fun It is to ride #

01:17:17.285 --> 01:17:20.486
# In a one horse
Open sleigh, hey #

01:17:20.487 --> 01:17:23.356
# Jingle bells Jingle bells #

01:17:23.357 --> 01:17:26.293
# Jingle all the way #

01:17:28.929 --> 01:17:29.864
Hey, you good?

01:17:29.865 --> 01:17:31.732
Yeah, okay.

01:17:44.078 --> 01:17:46.147
<i>It's huge.</i>

01:17:52.286 --> 01:17:54.422
Right. There it is.

01:18:03.263 --> 01:18:05.031
Okay, now be careful.

01:18:05.032 --> 01:18:07.802
I plan on it.

01:18:16.210 --> 01:18:18.979
Wait.

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:21.515
<i>No one's going to believe me.</i>

01:18:21.516 --> 01:18:24.450
This is the scientific
discovery of the century

01:18:24.451 --> 01:18:27.921
and no one's
going to believe me.

01:18:27.922 --> 01:18:30.489
Well, if it's any consolation,
I believe you.

01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:33.226
Just think, you've done enough
good deeds for the day

01:18:33.227 --> 01:18:37.230
that you won't be on Santa's
naughty list for the rest of your life.

01:18:37.231 --> 01:18:39.099
You should get out of here.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.334
Are you kidding? I'm not
going to miss this.

01:18:49.944 --> 01:18:51.846
Merry Christmas.

01:19:10.964 --> 01:19:12.967
<i>It's stuck.</i>

01:19:13.433 --> 01:19:15.335
Charlie.

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:28.148
I'm stuck.

01:20:33.213 --> 01:20:35.114
Alex.

01:20:35.115 --> 01:20:37.284
Hey, are you okay?

01:20:38.719 --> 01:20:40.453
Okay.

01:20:40.454 --> 01:20:43.389
Are you okay?

01:20:54.602 --> 01:20:56.636
We need to get out of here.

01:20:56.637 --> 01:20:58.940
Come on.

01:21:09.484 --> 01:21:12.253
How did this happen?

01:21:22.129 --> 01:21:23.396
Marley.

01:21:23.397 --> 01:21:25.999
Dad.

01:21:30.038 --> 01:21:31.256
Ben.

01:21:31.257 --> 01:21:32.439
Crystal.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:35.042
Mr. Crooge.

01:21:35.043 --> 01:21:39.112
Did you see my dad out there?

01:21:42.482 --> 01:21:44.517
We were together for a while.

01:21:44.518 --> 01:21:47.655
We split up.

01:22:02.637 --> 01:22:05.106
Dad.

01:22:17.552 --> 01:22:19.686
Dad. It's Dad. It's him.

01:22:19.687 --> 01:22:22.423
<i>Dad.</i>

01:22:24.124 --> 01:22:25.493
Are you okay?

01:22:25.494 --> 01:22:26.827
I'm fine, fine.

01:22:26.828 --> 01:22:28.694
This is Alex, the scientist
I told you about.

01:22:28.695 --> 01:22:31.530
This is my son, Tim, and Faye.

01:22:31.531 --> 01:22:33.601
Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:22:38.338 --> 01:22:40.239
Ben.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.641
It's good to see you.

01:22:42.642 --> 01:22:44.811
You, too.
