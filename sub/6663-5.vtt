ADULT ADAM:
<i>Ah, the romantic comedies</i>
<i>of the '80s...</i>

00:02.536 --> 00:05.004
<i>I learned everything I knew</i>
<i>about getting the girl</i>

00:05.006 --> 00:06.939
<i>from classics like</i>
Can't Buy Me Love,

00:06.941 --> 00:09.875
<i>because the romantic scenes</i>
<i>that played out in my house</i>

00:09.877 --> 00:12.378
<i>usually went a little</i>
<i>something like this.</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:14.113
Here.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.881
What's this?

00:15.883 --> 00:17.516
Birthday card.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.885
My birthday
was two weeks ago.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.021
Remember?
We had Mexican food.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.789
You had to race home
in a mad panic.

00:23.791 --> 00:27.326
Well, that photo finish
is why I forgot
to give you a card.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.828
You know what else
you forgot to do?

00:29.830 --> 00:30.596
Clean the garage.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.032
Give me some credit.
I didn't forget.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.933
It's gonna get done.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.707
I'll get my pants.

00:41.941 --> 00:43.208
Happy belated birthday.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.210
<i>I had the kind of parents</i>
<i>who loved each other,</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:48.113
<i>but I literally never once</i>
<i>saw them kiss,</i>

00:48.115 --> 00:52.484
<i>which is why I was what you'd</i>
<i>call romantically challenged.</i>

00:52.486 --> 00:54.653
<i>Her name was</i>
<i>Dana Caldwell.</i>

00:54.655 --> 00:56.622
<i>She biked past my house</i>
<i>every day,</i>

00:56.624 --> 00:58.524
<i>and she was perfect.</i>

00:58.526 --> 01:00.125
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:00.127 --> 01:02.761
I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt here,

01:02.763 --> 01:04.396
but I gotta say,
this looks weird.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.799
It's not weird.
I'm just filming
a girl I like

01:06.801 --> 01:09.802
to play the tape back later
to practice talking to her.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.770
Oh, boy.
It's weird.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.772
You know,
I can help you out.

01:13.774 --> 01:14.540
Pops, I'm 12.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.910
I gotta start handling
this lady stuff on my own.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.745
She's coming back.

01:21.147 --> 01:23.048
(GASPS)
Get down! Get down!

01:23.050 --> 01:25.317
<i>While I was crawling away</i>
<i>from the girl I loved,</i>

01:25.319 --> 01:29.088
<i>my father was trying to</i>
<i>get the girl he loved</i>
<i>off his back</i>

01:29.090 --> 01:30.189
<i>by cleaning the garage.</i>

01:30.191 --> 01:32.724
All right,
anything under $10...toss.

01:32.726 --> 01:35.961
All that crappy art
from when you were
kids...toss.

01:35.963 --> 01:40.132
No way!
It's my old keyboard!

01:40.134 --> 01:41.166
This thing is awesome!

01:41.168 --> 01:43.168
(BARRY'S VOICE RAISING PITCH)
<i>Awesome, awesome, awesome.</i>

01:43.170 --> 01:44.369
I thought you said
someone stole it.

01:44.371 --> 01:47.840
Yeah, well, the robber...
she was supposed
to throw it away.

01:47.842 --> 01:50.742
<i>Awesome, a-awesome,</i>
<i>a-awesome, a-awesome.</i>

01:50.744 --> 01:51.677
It's going in the garbage.

01:51.679 --> 01:54.313
No. This is mine,
and I love it, okay?

01:54.315 --> 01:56.148
Holy crap!
Check this out.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.384
I found a box of
Dad's old love poems
to Mom.

01:59.386 --> 02:00.819
Don't touch that!
Don't touch that!

02:00.821 --> 02:02.688
Come on.
It's none of your business.
Ready? "Tears stain

02:02.690 --> 02:04.456
"the pillows
of my heart"
Come on. Come on.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.859
No, no, come on!
"Your perfume lingers
on my mind

02:06.861 --> 02:09.027
"Return to me, my love"
Come on, come on!

02:09.029 --> 02:10.028
God, you're terrible.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.164
Okay, stop it.
Give me that box.

02:12.166 --> 02:12.698
Give...

02:12.700 --> 02:16.902
Whoa! "Our bodies are one
under the starry sky

02:16.904 --> 02:20.205

"My sweet Anita"?

02:21.509 --> 02:25.043
What?
It says here you were
gonna have a wedding?

02:25.045 --> 02:26.311
Anita? Who's Anita?

02:26.313 --> 02:30.516
Oh. I see
what's going on here.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.084
You have a secret family.

02:32.086 --> 02:32.985
If I had a secret family,

02:32.987 --> 02:35.654
why would I be standing here
talking to you people?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.890
Give me that box!
Here!

02:37.892 --> 02:39.992
Come on!
Got it!

02:40.059 --> 02:41.660
All right!
I'll tell you the story.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.530
Before your mother, I was
engaged to another woman.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.466
You're so hosed.
(VOICE PITCH RAISES)
<i>Hosed, hosed.</i>

02:47.468 --> 02:49.635
I am not hos...
Turn that off!

02:49.637 --> 02:51.236
I am not hosed.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.471
Nobody's getting hosed.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.773
Your mom knows
about the engagement.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.643
Oh, and she knows
all about the love letters?

02:58.044 --> 02:59.344
Of course she knows!

02:59.346 --> 03:02.047
(GARAGE DOOR WHIRRING)
She knows.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.716
Come on, kids,
give me the box!

03:04.718 --> 03:07.252
I wish I had
a secret family!

03:07.254 --> 03:09.288
I'm so hosed.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.557
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

03:11.559 --> 03:16.161
<i>♪ But nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

ADULT ADAM:  <i>October 4th,</i>
<i>1980-something...</i>

03:25.105 --> 03:28.140
<i>The day my dad's</i>
<i>old love letters went public.</i>

03:28.142 --> 03:29.374
Bevy,
before you say anything,

03:29.376 --> 03:34.012
just know that I thought
I threw this box out
years ago

03:34.014 --> 03:36.248
when Anita sent it
back to me,

03:36.250 --> 03:38.550
and it...it means nothing.

03:38.851 --> 03:41.620
<i>My father had crossed</i>
<i>a line.</i>

03:41.622 --> 03:42.854
(LAUGHING) I can't.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.389
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.459
I thought I could keep
a straight face,
but I can't.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.327
So you're not mad at me?

03:48.329 --> 03:51.630
No, I'm worried.
How are your loins?

03:51.632 --> 03:52.864
Have they stopped burning?
(GROANS)

03:52.866 --> 03:55.934
Is your heart
still aflutter?
Yeah.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.836
Adorable.
Yeah.

03:57.838 --> 03:58.770
(LAUGHS) Oh, no, no, no.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.373
So you're not even
a little bit jealous?

04:01.375 --> 04:03.408
Please. I won.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.143
I bagged my moose.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.846
You see?
She doesn't give a crap.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.215
That's what
a strong marriage is...

04:10.217 --> 04:12.951
Mutual not-giving-a-crap.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.453
See? Not hosed.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.287
Okay.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.422
We've had a good laugh.
Time to chuck 'em.

04:17.424 --> 04:20.092
Chuck 'em? (SNICKERS)
I can't even put 'em down.

04:20.094 --> 04:23.328
I mean, Dad used to be
pretty romantic.

04:23.330 --> 04:27.132
Oh, he's still
plenty romantic with me.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.500
(CHUCKLES)
Yuck.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.868
And how is Dad romantic?

04:29.870 --> 04:32.471
For the last two years,
he forgot your anniversary.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.507
In his defense,
I didn't remind him enough.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.110
But he writes romantic stuff
to me all the time.

04:38.112 --> 04:42.247
(CHUCKLES)
Look. Here's my
birthday card.

04:44.717 --> 04:47.185
"X.O.X.O. Murray."

04:47.187 --> 04:49.921
Well, the X's
are for kisses,

04:49.923 --> 04:52.758
and the O's for hugs.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.594
And "Murray"...

04:55.862 --> 04:57.729
Is who it's from.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.764
Doesn't matter
what he writes.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.300
We are more in love
than ever.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.735
Don't you at least wanna see
what she looks like?

05:03.737 --> 05:07.439
I've gone 20 years
without needing to know
what she looks like.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.108
I'm not gonna start now.

05:10.410 --> 05:14.279
(STAMMERS)
Oh, plus where would
you even get a picture,

05:14.281 --> 05:15.947
you know, if someone
wanted to see a picture?

05:15.949 --> 05:17.482
Where would you find it?
I don't know.
Well...

05:17.484 --> 05:20.385
They'd probably have
an engagement announcement
in the paper.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.120
I mean, if you really
wanted to look,

05:22.122 --> 05:25.991
you could probably just
go to the library
and dig it up.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.592
I don't need to see it.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.026
Fine.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.895
But if you would
feel better seeing it,

05:29.897 --> 05:32.497
fine, we'll go
to the library. Jeez.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.299
<i>While my mom</i>
<i>was feeling insecure,</i>

05:34.301 --> 05:36.501
<i>I was feeling damn good.</i>
<i>I had a plan.</i>

05:36.503 --> 05:39.071
<i>Dana Caldwell would see me</i>
<i>cooly tinkering with my bike</i>

05:39.073 --> 05:42.741
<i>and ask me to go for a ride,</i>
<i>and then we would</i>
<i>get married!</i>

05:42.743 --> 05:44.543
(BRAKES SQUEAL)

05:44.545 --> 05:45.844
Hey.
Hey.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.614
<i>It was now or never.</i>
<i>Time for my A game.</i>

05:49.616 --> 05:51.750
Bicycles, right?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.018
Bicycles.

05:53.020 --> 05:53.852
<i>Nope.</i>

05:53.854 --> 05:55.921
Do you know how
to fix them?

05:56.389 --> 05:57.089
Well...

05:57.091 --> 05:58.790
My bike chain's
all messed up.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.193
Maybe you could
take a look?

06:01.361 --> 06:04.996
Yeah, I can... I can
take a quick look-see.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.498
(CHUCKLES)

06:06.500 --> 06:08.533
Chain. Chain.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.836
(CLANK)

06:11.704 --> 06:12.204
Ugh.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.840
Wait. Is this one
of those soviet bikes?

06:14.842 --> 06:17.609
'Cause I only deal
with American equipment.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.410
Huh?
USA!

06:18.412 --> 06:21.313
Maybe I'll just have
my dad fix it.
(CHUCKLES)

06:21.315 --> 06:23.548
Makes sense.
Keep it in the family.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.418
(CLANK)
(GROANS LOUDLY)

06:27.420 --> 06:29.254
Aah!
Are you okay?

06:29.256 --> 06:31.723
Mmm-hmm.
Are you crying?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.091
No. (EXHALES)

06:33.093 --> 06:35.394
Good talking.
(WHIMPERING)

06:36.596 --> 06:37.996
<i>My plan was a complete bust.</i>

06:37.998 --> 06:42.200
<i>I only had one option left...</i>
<i>Call in the big guns.</i>

06:42.202 --> 06:46.538
So what happened to "I'm 12.
I gotta go it alone"?

06:46.540 --> 06:47.506
That didn't work out
so great.

06:47.508 --> 06:53.545
Well, you're safe now.
Love's my business,
and business is booming.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.313
So what do we got?

06:55.715 --> 06:57.282
Okay. Her name's Dana.

06:57.284 --> 07:00.218
She's 13,
lives down the block.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.887
She smells like
fruity pebbles.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.555
Pfft.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.823
Why are you
asking Pops for help

07:04.825 --> 07:07.192
when you got
all the resources
you need right here?

07:07.194 --> 07:08.460
You don't know anything
about girls.

07:08.462 --> 07:11.930
I know a ton. I've got
a super hot girlfriend.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.166
Yeah, from Canada
that no one's ever seen.

07:14.168 --> 07:16.902
'Cause I met her at camp,
ya sausage gobbler.

07:16.904 --> 07:20.038
You couldn't come up
with something
a little more original?

07:20.040 --> 07:22.941
I mean, a fake girlfriend...
In Canada?

07:22.943 --> 07:26.178
Hey! There's nothing fake
about her except her boobs!

07:26.180 --> 07:30.782
Yep, they're huge and real...
But they're also fake.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.084
You know what?
I don't have to
explain it to you.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.820
I'm outta here.

07:36.088 --> 07:38.924
Her breasts sound
very complicated.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.326
So where are we at
with this Dana girl?

07:41.328 --> 07:44.596
Well, I've been secretly
following her around
for two weeks.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.331
Creating a sense
of mystery.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.933
And today I broke
her bicycle.

07:47.935 --> 07:51.503
Good. You made a memorable
first impression.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.771
And I kinda cried
in front of her.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.440
Some women like
a sensitive man.

07:55.442 --> 07:58.376
You think?
You can't help him, Pops.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.644
He's un-help-able.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.214
He'll never get a girlfriend
even half as hot as mine.

08:02.216 --> 08:05.383
Oh, yeah? What's her name?
Tell me right now. Go.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.952
Marion Lemieux.

08:06.954 --> 08:07.819
Marion Lemieux?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.688
Like Mario Lemieux,
the hockey player?

08:09.690 --> 08:12.724
Yeah! It's a common last name
in Canada,

08:12.726 --> 08:13.625
like "Smith" or "Jones."

08:13.627 --> 08:16.795
I was trying to
be nice to you,
but forget it.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.864
I'm outta here.

08:19.866 --> 08:20.365
Okay.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.901
Your next move with Dana
is important.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.236
You gotta go for it.

08:24.238 --> 08:25.504
Make a big gesture...

08:25.506 --> 08:29.441
Something that'll show her
exactly how you feel.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.977
Pfft. Waste of time.

08:31.979 --> 08:32.577
Here we go.

08:32.579 --> 08:34.880
This nerd has no clue
with the ladies.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.715
Yeah? Let's call Marion
right now.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.783
Think I won't?
'Cause I will.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.318
That's what
I'm asking you to do.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.288
I don't need this!
I'm outta here.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.438
