GABBY HAS FULL AUTHORITY.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.033
TELL AARON.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.784
AND THEN TELL HIM
WHAT IT MEANS.

08:13.868 --> 08:14.785
- GOOD NIGHT!

08:14.869 --> 08:17.121
HAVE FUN.
DON'T RUSH HOME.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.248
- WHAT'S WRONG, JAMES?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.459
YOU BURNT TOO?
[chuckles]

08:27.006 --> 08:28.549
- OH!
THERE SHE IS.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.592
HEY!

08:29.675 --> 08:30.426
smooch!

08:30.509 --> 08:32.510
EVERYONE, THIS IS STEPHANIE.

08:32.595 --> 08:33.511
- HI, EVERYONE.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.804
SORRY I'M LATE.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.224
- LOOK AT YOU.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.769
I CAN REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE A FOOT TALL

08:39.852 --> 08:42.104
AND CUTER THAN A BUG'S TOOTH.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.648
AND NOW YOU'RE ALMOST GROWN.

08:46.567 --> 08:47.610
- ACTUALLY, DR. SHARPE,

08:47.693 --> 08:49.237
YOU'RE THINKING
OF MY DAUGHTER, GABBY.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.529
THIS IS MY <i> WIFE,</i>
STEPHANIE.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.699
- YOUR WIFE?

08:53.783 --> 08:56.077
WELL, I'M CONFUSED.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.495
I MET YOUR WIFE
A FEW YEARS AGO,

08:57.578 --> 09:01.415
AND SHE LOOKED
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.501
OLDER.

09:03.584 --> 09:04.710
- YES, MRS. SHARPE,

09:04.794 --> 09:06.254
THAT WAS MY EX-WIFE, KIMBERLY.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.131
- THAT'S RIGHT, KIMBERLY.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.218
OH, WHAT A SPECTACULAR WOMAN.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.096
KIMBERLY.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.932
YOU TWO MADE
SUCH A LOVELY COUPLE.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.642
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HER?

09:19.725 --> 09:20.309
- WE DIVORCED.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.187
AND THIS IS MY NEW WIFE,

09:23.271 --> 09:25.273
SPECTACULAR STEPHANIE.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.234
CUTTING IT
A LITTLE CLOSE THERE.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.485
MY SPEECH IS
JUST ABOUT TO START.

09:29.568 --> 09:31.529
- SORRY, THE SITTER FLAKED
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.740
LISTEN, I HAD TO LEAVE
GABBY IN CHARGE.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.284
- YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

09:36.367 --> 09:38.327
I THOUGHT WE DECIDED
THAT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.162
-<i> WE</i> WEREN'T THERE TONIGHT,

09:40.246 --> 09:42.707
SO <i> I</i> HAD TO MAKE
THE CALL MYSELF.

09:42.790 --> 09:43.833
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.167
I MADE THE CALL MYSELF.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.044
- YOU SHOULD HAVE CHECKED
WITH ME FIRST.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.714
- I DIDN'T KNOW
I NEEDED YOUR PERMISSION, DAD.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.137
- OH, THEY'RE SERVING STEAK.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.680
HONEY, WOULD YOU
DIG DOWN IN YOUR PURSE

09:57.763 --> 09:59.557
AND GET OUT MY PARTY TEETH?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.021
[funky music]

10:05.104 --> 10:08.524
- MY RULES ARE THE SAME
AS ANY OTHER BABYSITTER.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.651
BATH, BRUSH TEETH,
PAJAMAS ON BY 8:30.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.945
THEN BACK TO BRUSH
YOUR TEETH AGAIN

10:13.029 --> 10:14.780
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO IT
THE FIRST TIME.

10:16.490 --> 10:19.368
LIGHTS OUT 9:00 SHARP.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.953
- PARDON ME, WARDEN.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.915
WHEN DO WE HAVE TIME TO WATCH
<i>SWAMP BUGGY SHOWDOWN?</i>

10:24.999 --> 10:26.167
RIGHT AFTER YOU SCRAPE THE REST
OF THAT MAC AND CHEESE

10:26.250 --> 10:28.502
OFF YOUR PLATE,

10:28.586 --> 10:29.211
AND YOU HAVE TO PUT IT
IN THE DISHWASHER.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.255
- ALREADY DID IT.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.215
- NOT SO FAST.
AARON?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.134
DID JAMES CLEAR HIS DISH?

10:35.217 --> 10:36.802
- JAMES TOLD ME TO SAY "YES."

10:36.886 --> 10:38.512
SO YES.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.141
- SO NO.
DISH. NOW.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.351
- FINE.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.853
I'LL GO PUT MY STUPID DISH
IN THE DISHWASHER.

10:45.936 --> 10:49.940
- GABBY, I PUT MY DISH
IN THE DISHWASHER.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.486
- DIDN'T I GIVE YOU
A PAPER PLATE?

10:53.569 --> 10:55.488
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT
THOSE IN THE DISHW--

10:55.571 --> 10:56.906
OH, JAMES WILL FIND IT.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.212
- YOUNG LADY,

11:11.295 --> 11:13.589
WOULD YOU CARE
FOR A DINNER ROLL?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.425
- HMM, I WANT ONE,
BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S ALLOWED.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.259
CHARLIE,
DO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION

11:17.343 --> 11:18.803
TO HAVE A DINNER ROLL?

11:20.763 --> 11:22.723
- YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION
TO STOP DOING THIS ALL NIGHT.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.851
I'M JUST SAYING,
I KNOW THESE KIDS.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.436
AND I KNOW THIS IS
NOT GONNA END WELL.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.604
- WELL, I KNOW
THESE KIDS TOO,

11:28.687 --> 11:30.940
AND I KNOW
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.024
AND AT THE VERY LEAST,

11:32.108 --> 11:33.609
I'M WILLING
TO GIVE HER THAT CHANCE.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.486
- EXCUSE ME
FOR EAVESDROPPING, DEAR,

11:35.569 --> 11:36.612
BUT YOU'RE 100% RIGHT.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.782
THEY'RE YOUR CHILDREN TOO,
FOR PETE'S SAKE.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.537
- ROSALYN,
THEY'RE NOT HER CHILDREN.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.455
THEY'RE KIMBERLY'S.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.456
- I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIMBERLY.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.750
WHAT DID HE DO WITH KIMBERLY?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.546
- CHARLIE, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE SO UPSET.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.923
YOU SAID YOU TRUSTED ME
TO MAKE THE CALL.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.383
- YES, THE CALL

11:57.466 --> 11:58.426
TO THE SERVICE

11:58.509 --> 11:59.927
TO GET THE BABYSITTER.

12:01.345 --> 12:04.473
- IF THAT'S NOT KIMBERLY,
WHO THE HECK IS IT?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.600
- ROSALYN, I TOLD YOU.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.145
KIMBERLY IS THE OLD WIFE.

12:09.228 --> 12:09.937
THIS IS THE BABYSITTER.

12:14.108 --> 12:14.942
- WHAT DID I MISS?

12:15.025 --> 12:16.152
- YOU MISSED THE DISHWASHER.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.695
I SAW YOU THROW YOUR DISH
IN THE GARBAGE.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.155
GO BACK IN THERE
AND FISH IT OUT.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.366
- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT POLITE
TO SPY ON PEOPLE.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.409
- COME ON, JAMES.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.785
I JUST WANT DAD AND STEPHANIE

12:24.869 --> 12:26.704
TO SEE THAT WE DON'T NEED
A BABYSITTER.

12:26.787 --> 12:27.955
- WE HAVE A BABYSITTER
WE DON'T NEED.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.542
IT'S YOU.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.379
- THEY CAN'T COME HOME
AND FIND A PLATE IN THE GARBAGE.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.422
JUST STICK IT
IN THE DISHWASHER.

12:36.505 --> 12:37.882
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED
TO PRE-RINSE.

12:37.965 --> 12:38.674
- AARON WILL DO IT.
RIGHT, AARON?

12:38.757 --> 12:40.551
- OKAY.
- AARON, SIT.

12:40.634 --> 12:41.469
- OKAY.
- AARON, GO.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.472
- OKAY.
- AARON, STAY.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.056
- LOOK AT ME.
I'M IMPORTANT.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.437
- JAMES, GO GET
THAT DISH RIGHT NOW

12:51.520 --> 12:52.688
OR I'M SENDING YOU TO BED.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.023
- SENDING ME TO BED?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.024
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.693
- STEPHANIE GAVE ME
FULL AUTHORITY.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.361
AND I'M WARNING YOU,
I'M PREPARED TO USE IT.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.864
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.491
- WE'LL JUST SEE WHAT DAD
HAS TO SAY ABOUT THIS.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.910
HOW DO YOU SPELL "TYRANT"?

13:08.954 --> 13:10.080
- AND NOW,

13:10.164 --> 13:11.373
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

13:11.457 --> 13:13.834
GIVING OUR KEYNOTE
ADDRESS TONIGHT,

13:13.918 --> 13:16.587
WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE
AN ESTEEMED CARDIAC SURGEON

13:16.670 --> 13:19.757
FROM PENNSYLVANIA GENERAL,

13:19.840 --> 13:22.426
DR. CHARLES PHILLIPS.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.552
DOCTOR?

13:23.636 --> 13:27.973
[applause]

13:31.602 --> 13:35.814
- UM, I'M NOT SURE,
BUT I THINK THAT'S YOU.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.233
- HMM?

13:37.316 --> 13:38.734
OH!

13:39.318 --> 13:41.987
[applause]

13:46.116 --> 13:47.576
[phone dings]

13:47.660 --> 13:48.702
- KABOOM.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.788
DAD SAYS,
"GABBY CAN'T PUNISH YOU.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.082
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT STEPHANIE SAYS."

13:53.165 --> 13:54.458
- HE DID NOT SAY THAT.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.293
- READ IT AND WEEP.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.045
- WELL, LET'S SEE
WHAT STEPHANIE HAS TO SAY

13:58.128 --> 13:59.838
ABOUT DAD SAYING THAT
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SHE SAYS.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.635
- OH, ASK HER
IF I CAN HAVE A POPSICLE.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.307
- WHEN I WAS ASKED
TO SPEAK ABOUT SURGEONS

14:10.391 --> 14:11.934
AND THE GOD COMPLEX,

14:12.017 --> 14:13.143
I WAS A LITTLE OVERWHELMED.

14:13.227 --> 14:17.147
SO I DISCUSSED THE TOPIC
WITH MY ANESTHESIOLOGIST,

14:17.231 --> 14:17.648
SAINT PETER.

14:17.731 --> 14:20.276
[laughter]

14:20.359 --> 14:21.944
- BUT SERIOUSLY,

14:22.027 --> 14:24.446
WE PHYSICIANS MAKE
LIFE-AND-DEATH DECISIONS

14:24.530 --> 14:25.281
ON A DAILY BASIS.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.449
BUT VERY OFTEN,

14:27.533 --> 14:29.618
OUR DOING SO
CREATES WITHIN US

14:29.702 --> 14:32.329
A QUALITY
THAT CAN BUILD BARRIERS...

14:32.413 --> 14:33.914
- IS SOMETHING WRONG, DEAR?

14:33.998 --> 14:36.000
- YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.918
MY HUSBAND WENT
BEHIND MY BACK

14:38.002 --> 14:40.296
AND TOLD THE KIDS
NOT TO LISTEN TO ME.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.547
THE JERK.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.798
- OH, HEAVENS.

14:42.881 --> 14:43.465
YOU SHOULDN'T PUT UP
WITH THAT.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.676
IF I EVER MEET HIM,

14:45.759 --> 14:47.303
I'LL GIVE HIM
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

14:49.221 --> 14:53.267
- YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
INTRODUCE YOU TO DR. PHILLIPS.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.893
I HEAR HE'S DIVORCED.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.231
- THOSE SEEKING TREATMENT...

14:59.315 --> 15:01.859
- WHO NEEDS SWAMP BUGGY WHEN
YOU'VE GOT <i> RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE?</i>

15:01.942 --> 15:03.986
WHOO, YOU BETTER WORK,
CINNAMON STICK.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.283
- WHY ARE THOSE LADIES SO TALL?

15:10.618 --> 15:13.287
- WHY IS GABBY SO LAME?

15:14.163 --> 15:16.749
- JAMES, PLEASE.
I'M BEGGING YOU.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.208
JUST PUT YOUR DISH
IN THE DISHWASHER,

15:18.292 --> 15:20.586
AND WE CAN TURN ON
YOUR SWAMP BUGGY SHOW.

15:20.669 --> 15:21.920
- I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.256
- HEY!

15:25.758 --> 15:27.718
- I LIKE THAT SHOW!

15:27.801 --> 15:28.344
THAT'S GOOD!

15:28.427 --> 15:30.346
WAIT.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.181
I HATE THAT SHOW!

15:32.264 --> 15:34.391
GO BACK.
GO BACK.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.851
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO SEE THAT.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.737
COME ON!

15:48.781 --> 15:50.115
- AND SO I THINK
WE CAN ALL AGREE

15:50.199 --> 15:55.954
THAT PLAYING "GOD"
IS A "COMPLEX" SUBJECT.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.373
[laughs]

15:57.456 --> 15:59.041
THANK YOU.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.085
[applause]

16:01.168 --> 16:03.671
NOW I'LL OPEN IT UP
FOR QUESTIONS.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.047
- DR. PHILLIPS,

16:05.130 --> 16:06.715
I'D LIKE
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING

16:06.799 --> 16:09.301
ABOUT YOUR BIG OLD
"GOD COMPLEX."

16:12.805 --> 16:13.681
- ANYONE ELSE?

16:13.764 --> 16:16.558
FROM THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY?

16:16.642 --> 16:17.184
SOMEONE WHO'S NOT
A PLUS-ONE?

16:19.645 --> 16:21.897
OH, YOU THERE,
WITH YOUR HAND UP.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.732
- I WAS JUST TRYING
TO FLAG DOWN A WAITER.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.403
- CAN SOMEONE GET THAT MAN
A WAITER, STAT?

16:28.904 --> 16:31.115
- STILL HERE.

16:31.198 --> 16:31.782
- OKAY, FINE.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.118
- HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION:

16:34.201 --> 16:36.578
SAY DR. "A"
IS ON VACATION

16:36.662 --> 16:39.081
WHEN A PATIENT
NEEDS A PACEMAKER.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.749
SO DR. "B,"

16:40.833 --> 16:43.502
A SURGEON
HE CLAIMS TO TRUST,

16:43.585 --> 16:44.211
PUTS IT IN.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.212
DO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY

16:45.295 --> 16:47.172
FOR DR. "A"
TO CALL THE HOSPITAL

16:47.256 --> 16:48.173
AND TELL THEM
TO TAKE IT BACK OUT?

16:52.344 --> 16:53.637
- WELL, DR. "A" MAY HAVE

16:53.721 --> 16:55.264
A LONGER HISTORY
WITH THE PATIENT,

16:55.347 --> 16:57.933
SO MAYBE HE KNOWS
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

16:58.016 --> 16:59.435
- BUT ISN'T DR. "A"

16:59.518 --> 17:02.396
DESTROYING DR. "B"'S
CREDIBILITY WITH THE PATIENT?

17:02.479 --> 17:03.939
I MEAN, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE AWAY DR. "B"'S LICENSE

17:04.021 --> 17:06.817
AND MAKE HER
A CANDY STRIPER?

17:07.859 --> 17:09.153
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,

17:09.236 --> 17:12.948
DR. "A" WOULD SIMPLY
EXPLAIN TO DR. "B" THAT--

17:16.076 --> 17:17.161
HE WOULD NEED
TO APOLOGIZE TO HER.

17:19.913 --> 17:20.372
DOCTORS AREN'T PERFECT.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.790
[all gasp]

17:24.877 --> 17:27.253
- I'M SURE DR. "B" WOULD
APPRECIATE THAT APOLOGY.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.217
- I'M NOT CERTAIN,
BUT I THINK I'M DR. "B."

17:39.683 --> 17:41.727
- OKAY, NO MATTER
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE KIDS,

17:41.810 --> 17:43.729
WE PRESENT A UNITED FRONT.

17:43.812 --> 17:44.813
- AGREED.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.523
- FROM NOW ON,
NO UNDERMINING

17:46.607 --> 17:47.316
OR SECOND-GUESSING.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.610
- I'VE ALREADY APOLOGIZED.

17:49.693 --> 17:50.903
BE A GRACIOUS WINNER.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.070
- OKAY.
ONE MORE THING.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.114
AH, AH, AH, AH.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.993
NOW WE'RE GOOD.

17:58.076 --> 18:00.245
ALL RIGHT, THE TEXT MESSAGES
STOPPED AN HOUR AGO.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.080
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE'RE GONNA FIND IN THERE?

18:02.164 --> 18:03.081
- HOPEFULLY NOTHING
THAT REQUIRES A TELETHON.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.127
- YOU GO FIRST.
I CAN'T LOOK.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.840
- ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.675
- NICE TRY.
YOU ROLLED A TWO.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.843
- OOPS.
FOUR, THREE, TWO.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.679
- [laughs]
MY TURN.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.096
HEY, HOW WAS YOUR SPEECH?

18:20.599 --> 18:21.767
- NO BROKEN GLASS.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.477
CEILING'S STILL INTACT.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.855
THREE KIDS.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.774
SIX ARMS.
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.067
- YOU GUYS WORKED IT ALL OUT?

18:30.150 --> 18:32.778
- THAT'S WHAT
GOOD BABYSITTERS DO.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.071
- AND SHE IS
ONE GOOD BABYSITTER.

18:34.154 --> 18:37.324
- AND WE GET A LOT OF CHANNELS
YOU DON'T LET ME WATCH.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.913
- WELL, HERE'S YOUR MONEY,
GABBY.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.540
YOU EARNED IT.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.040
- YOU'RE PAYING HER?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.125
- UNITED FRONT.

18:49.002 --> 18:49.920
- SOMETHING'S WRONG.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.880
- NOTHING'S WRONG, DR. "A."

18:51.964 --> 18:54.842
THE PATIENT'S
RESTING QUIETLY.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.301
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.096
- BEDTIME WAS TEN MINUTES AGO.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.097
- I KNOW,
BUT THEY WERE SO WELL BEHAVED,

19:00.180 --> 19:02.266
I SAID WE COULD FINISH
THE GAME.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.976
- OUR TEETH
ARE ALREADY BRUSHED.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.144
- WE FAKE BRUSHED,
AND THEN WE REAL BRUSHED.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.648
- CHARLIE.

19:09.731 --> 19:10.315
- ALL RIGHT.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.692
WE'LL BE UPSTAIRS...

19:11.775 --> 19:13.569
AND LISTENING.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.570
- GOOD NIGHT.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.946
SLEEP TIGHT.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.325
SEE?
EVERYBODY WINS.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.000
- WHY SHOULD I CUT YOU IN
ON THIS?

19:28.083 --> 19:29.918
- 'CAUSE ONE DAY,
YOU'LL BABYSIT ME,

19:30.002 --> 19:31.962
AND I LEARNED FROM YOU.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.967
- TODAY, YOU ARE
TRULY MY BROTHER.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.100
- I THINK I'VE GOT IT.

19:45.183 --> 19:47.936
CHARLIE WAS YOUR STUDENT
IN MEDICAL SCHOOL,

19:48.020 --> 19:50.647
AND HE WAS MARRIED
TO KIMBERLY,

19:50.731 --> 19:51.857
AND THEY HAD THREE KIDS.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.276
GABBY'S THE OLDEST,

19:54.359 --> 19:56.069
JAMES IS THE MIDDLE,

19:56.153 --> 19:57.571
AND AARON'S THE BABY.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.949
THEN CHARLIE AND KIMBERLY
GOT DIVORCED,

20:01.033 --> 20:03.577
AND NOW HE'S MARRIED
TO STEPHANIE.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.786
- OH, FOR GOODNESS' SAKE,
ROSALYN,

20:04.870 --> 20:07.289
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.878
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
LAWRENCE AND CONNIE.

20:12.961 --> 20:15.088
- THOSE ARE OUR KIDS.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.800
- WELL, THEN FIND MY CAR KEYS

20:18.884 --> 20:20.469
SO WE CAN GO HOME ALREADY.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.139
- CLIFFORD, YOU HAVEN'T DRIVEN
IN TEN YEARS.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.142
- THEN WE BETTER CALL A CAB.

20:27.225 --> 20:28.352
I'M OPERATING
IN THE MORNING.
