00:44.169 --> 00:45.378
Hello!

00:47.631 --> 00:48.965
Over here!

00:52.219 --> 00:53.803
Please help me!

00:57.307 --> 00:58.474
Help!

01:07.651 --> 01:08.734
Can you hear me?

01:09.653 --> 01:11.320
I see you!

01:20.205 --> 01:22.999
Ah, the Lord has
answered my prayers.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.502
Bless you, my son,
bless you. Good dog.

01:28.714 --> 01:32.883
That's me poor mule here. She's
hurt. She's hurt really bad.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.846
How long you been
walkin' her like that?

01:37.389 --> 01:39.223
Ah. Not far.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.942
Well, if she's in pain,
you oughta put her down.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.111
Nah.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.447
I don't think
I could do that.

01:54.865 --> 01:55.948
She was good to you.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.075
It's only right.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.369
No sense in
lettin' her suffer.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.748
No, you misunderstand me.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.835
See, it's not that I lack the
conviction to shoot this animal.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.086
The Lord is Himself would
give me the strength for that.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.214
No, no, it's more it's a...

02:13.383 --> 02:15.259
It's a matter of practicality.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.387
See, do you believe in God,
my son?

02:23.602 --> 02:26.812
Ah, well, me and this mule
here, we do the Lord's work...

02:27.731 --> 02:31.901
Been traveling all across this
land preaching the good word.

02:32.903 --> 02:37.657
And over that hill there down into
the valley is the town of Denton.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.785
That's our next stop.
You familiar?

02:42.245 --> 02:45.915
Ah, let me give you a little
insight into our situation.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.418
Denton is a town
that is run by sinners.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.088
Just like many of
the others that we visited.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.173
No church,
no religion left to speak of.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.967
Many of its residents have...
They've lost their way.

02:58.470 --> 03:01.472
So you see, traveler, if I
cannot get this goddamned mule

03:01.598 --> 03:02.848
over that goddamn hill,

03:02.933 --> 03:05.184
then I cannot heal
those poor souls

03:05.268 --> 03:07.770
with the gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Praise his name.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.564
I've been praying,
and I've been praying all day

03:10.649 --> 03:12.483
for the Lord to
hear my troubles.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.859
I've asked him...

03:14.528 --> 03:16.737
And I know that he wants me
to help those people.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.323
I know that he wants me to save
those that need to be saved.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.118
Especially the women.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.038
They are ripe with sin.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.040
So I asked the Lord,

03:28.125 --> 03:30.543
I said, "Do not forsake them,
and do not forsake me.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.963
"Send me someone to help
get over that hill. "

03:35.006 --> 03:36.173
And sure enough,

03:37.175 --> 03:38.509
he answered my prayers.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.516
Now, I'm afraid I'm gonna be
needin' that horse of yours.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.853
So, please, my son,

03:49.563 --> 03:50.980
kindly climb down,

03:52.023 --> 03:53.065
hand over the reins...

03:54.609 --> 03:55.735
For the Lord.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.240
Did you not hear me, boy?

04:03.034 --> 04:04.618
Aren't you listening?

04:05.036 --> 04:06.287
No, Father.

04:06.955 --> 04:07.997
I don't believe I was.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.129
Get it off me!

04:16.673 --> 04:17.964
Get her off of me!

04:30.937 --> 04:33.773
I stopped listening to men
like you a long time ago.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.357
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Quiet.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.234
Don't shoot.
Be quiet!

04:37.778 --> 04:39.737
Or you'll be speaking
to your Lord directly.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.865
Now, I'm willing to
make you a trade. Trade?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.533
Yeah, I ain't no thief.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.911
I'll trade you your life

04:46.995 --> 04:48.412
for these bullets
and whatever water

04:48.497 --> 04:49.830
you got left there
in your canteen.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.958
Considering the circumstances,
that seems more than fair.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.212
Unless, as a man of God,
you don't fear death,

04:57.589 --> 04:59.173
and you're content
in your convictions

04:59.257 --> 05:01.217
and prepared to meet your
maker, right here and right now.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.887
In which case,
I will oblige you.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.431
Because I'm not a thief,
but I am a killer.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.892
And I've killed
better men than some drunk

05:10.435 --> 05:13.062
wanderin' around pretending
to preach the word of God.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.313
So are you prepared?

05:14.397 --> 05:17.358
You got confidence in your
convictions or you wanna make a deal?

05:17.859 --> 05:18.901
Deal.
What?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.402
Yes, I want to make a deal.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.196
All right, good,

05:22.280 --> 05:24.865
'cause I promised my dog I wasn't
gonna kill anybody on this trip,

05:25.325 --> 05:27.785
and I don't wanna break
my promise here today.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.582
Hey, now, the trade
wasn't for the whiskey.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.336
No, it wasn't.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.547
There.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.007
You!

05:42.676 --> 05:45.344
You say there's a town
right beyond that ridge?

05:46.555 --> 05:49.181
Well, you give this
mule a little rest,

05:49.933 --> 05:51.433
he'll get you there
just fine.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.644
But I don't ever
wanna see you again.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.896
I hate charlatans.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.650
I want you to
stay right here...

06:01.278 --> 06:02.862
Till you learn to
respect your animal.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.531
God damn you.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.824
You'll pay for this.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.493
The devil is waiting for
men like you. He's waiting!

06:09.870 --> 06:11.704
Well, if the devil's
looking for me,

06:12.247 --> 06:13.998
you can tell him
I'm headed to Mexico.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.833
He can meet me there.
Come on.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.878
That's all there is.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.925
I know.
I'm thirsty, too.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.744
I'd say the border
is about 10 days away.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.620
What do you think?

09:01.416 --> 09:03.417
We'd waste a lot of time
going around that valley,

09:04.961 --> 09:07.713
and there's no guarantee
there's water on the other side.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.467
Oh, it's a straight shot
right through that town.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.385
Oh, Jesus.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.888
I don't know
about you, but...

09:18.349 --> 09:22.394
A fresh meal and a warm bath
sound pretty good right about now.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.735
Cathy'd roll her eyes
if she could see us now?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.820
All dirty and starvin'.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.324
You can't live on
flies alone, you know.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.751
We gotta keep our
heads down, okay?

09:46.377 --> 09:47.419
No trouble.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.088
You gotta be on
your best behavior.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.215
Yeah.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.591
I know.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.302
I know.
Same goes for me.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.631
Looks like that
priest was right.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.718
God must've packed up
and left with the rest of 'em.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.280
Come on.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.545
Shit.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.941
How would someone spend
an hour in this town?

11:47.415 --> 11:49.416
If your name was Dollar Bill,
is that where you'd be?

11:51.419 --> 11:53.212
All right, listen,
you stay here with Lady.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.547
If I'm wrong and he comes back,
you give a bark. You got it?

11:58.635 --> 12:01.094
Okay.
I'll take that as a yes.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.104
Now, gentlemen, gentlemen,

12:11.189 --> 12:12.648
please allow me to
keep your attention

12:12.732 --> 12:14.024
for just a few moments more.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.817
I came all this way,
and I must admit

12:15.902 --> 12:17.694
that I have indeed
saved the best

12:18.196 --> 12:19.321
for last.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.573
Although I am disappointed
you did not take

12:21.658 --> 12:24.201
to the lilac powder
or the ladies elixir,

12:24.285 --> 12:25.369
I am certain

12:25.453 --> 12:27.663
these next two items are
just what you're looking for.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.331
Men of your ilk
require something

12:29.415 --> 12:30.874
very special,
very special indeed,

12:30.959 --> 12:32.167
and if I can't
see to that,

12:32.252 --> 12:34.461
well, then my name
isn't William T. Baxter.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.631
Now, I know that sounds
braggadocious of me to say,

12:37.715 --> 12:39.800
but as you can
no doubt see,

12:40.134 --> 12:44.554
I'm quite confident in
what I have to offer.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.598
What'll it be?

12:46.683 --> 12:48.600
I'm looking for
a man named Dollar Bill.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.561
Oh, DB's shop's
across the street.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.690
Yeah, sign on his door
says he's out.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.860
Well, 2:00, he takes a break
to feed his pigs.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.657
Now it's almost 3:00. You
should be able to catch him then.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.742
Can I get you a drink?

13:07.620 --> 13:08.662
Some water.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.873
Just water?
Yeah, and...

13:13.084 --> 13:14.126
A bowl?

13:15.211 --> 13:17.754
You want the water
in a bowl?

13:17.839 --> 13:19.089
The bowl is for my dog.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.801
Bowl is for the dog.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.892
These here are the finest
handguns currently available.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.853
The greatest equalizers.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.731
Forty-five calibers designed
by Samuel Colt himself.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.483
Twenty-four karat gold inlaid.
Raised elephant ivory grip.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.819
And when I tell you that the
front sight is accurate enough

13:40.903 --> 13:43.739
to pick a flea
off a dog's ass...

13:46.034 --> 13:47.784
I do not exaggerate.

13:48.286 --> 13:51.121
Now, I can let you
have them for only $30 apiece

13:51.205 --> 13:52.622
or 50 for the pair.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.251
Now, gentlemen, please, before you
speak, that isn't just a bargain.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.004
That is a steal.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.090
Quite frankly, there's no better
revolver on the market today,

14:02.175 --> 14:04.176
and I lay
my reputation on it.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.179
As you can imagine, being in
the industry that I am in,

14:07.930 --> 14:10.932
my reputation, gentlemen,
is everything.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.188
You never mind your...

14:18.649 --> 14:19.691
Reputation.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.370
So you're saying that this,

14:31.746 --> 14:33.372
this is the best gun
on the market?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.207
Yes, sir.
I say it with pride.

14:35.291 --> 14:40.087
Well, nobody west of Texas will be
able to handle it better than me.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.718
Hell, that is nice.
What do ya say, boys?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.055
Harris, you even see that?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.641
No, can't say I did.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.018
I almost put one
right between your eyes there.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.645
What about you, Roy?
Did you see anything?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.397
I ain't seen nothin'.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.818
Tubby, I know
you didn't see shit

15:02.902 --> 15:03.944
'cause you were
too busy thinking

15:04.028 --> 15:06.196
what you were gonna have
for lunch, right?

15:06.948 --> 15:08.073
Hey!

15:08.950 --> 15:10.242
Stranger.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.704
You ever seen anybody so
neat with a pistol before?

15:17.583 --> 15:18.625
Hey!

15:18.709 --> 15:19.793
Pard!

15:20.920 --> 15:23.547
You deaf or something?
I'm talking to you.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.763
You think this thing's loaded?
What do you say we find out?

15:33.474 --> 15:35.600
You should be careful
who you point a gun at.

15:39.564 --> 15:42.607
So, do we have a deal here?

15:43.568 --> 15:45.235
Thirty dollars?

15:47.947 --> 15:50.365
Do I look like I have $30?

15:51.909 --> 15:53.618
You take a look
around this town.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.829
Nobody buying
nothing from you.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.171
Do you...

16:05.840 --> 16:07.299
Do you know what
they call this place?

16:12.472 --> 16:15.432
They call it
"Valley of Violence. "

16:17.602 --> 16:21.104
Now, why don't you pack up,
before you find out why.

16:22.857 --> 16:23.940
Move.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.163
Now...

16:40.541 --> 16:41.958
What were you
sayin' to me?

16:45.922 --> 16:47.672
You answer me
when I talk to you.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.350
What's the matter?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.686
Cat got your tongue
all of a sudden?

17:13.031 --> 17:15.032
Well, you look
like a bum.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.002
You smell like a bum, too.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.631
Jesus.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.634
That's one ugly scar
you got.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.764
Hey, fellas.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.100
I don't think this bum
knows where he is.

17:42.687 --> 17:46.273
And you must not know
who I am neither.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.196
Wanna find out?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.409
You talk too much...

17:58.160 --> 17:59.452
Whoever you are.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.292
All right!

18:05.376 --> 18:09.754
Anyone who wants to see a fight
better get out here right now.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.881
I'm about to show you
what it's like

18:11.966 --> 18:13.675
when you run your mouth
at Gilly Martin.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.802
You gonna get him, Gilly?
Oh, Tubby,

18:15.886 --> 18:17.429
I'm gonna get him so good,

18:17.555 --> 18:21.099
he's gonna be lookin' to you for
tips on places to sit.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.310
Ellen. Ellen!

18:23.394 --> 18:25.979
Sweetheart!
Where the hell are you?

18:26.397 --> 18:27.856
Get out here and see this.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.649
You are definitely
gonna wanna see

18:29.734 --> 18:31.318
what I am about
to do to this man.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.612
What's going on?
What's all this hubbub?

18:33.696 --> 18:37.824
What's goin' on?
Baby, some dried up dick licker

18:37.908 --> 18:41.202
came into town this morning and
I'm about to teach him a lesson

18:41.287 --> 18:42.954
on how things work
around here.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.623
You gonna fight him?

18:44.707 --> 18:46.416
Oh, I'm gonna
beat him bad, baby.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.543
It's time to watch
your man go to work.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.670
Oh, I love a good fight!

18:51.714 --> 18:53.965
Y'all could learn
somethin' out here today. Yes.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.634
This here...

18:57.053 --> 18:58.511
This is my town.

18:59.430 --> 19:02.349
Anybody who don't know it,
you better take notice.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.312
Now you gonna face me
like a man or what?

19:13.944 --> 19:15.320
No offense, mister,

19:16.113 --> 19:19.282
I don't know you and I don't
think nothin' cross about you.

19:19.367 --> 19:22.702
But that shot is on the house
if you will get outta here.

19:31.212 --> 19:35.340
Now don't worry, everyone,
you are gonna see a fight.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.512
Get him, baby!
Be a man.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.228
I know what the problem is.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.146
Now I know.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.150
You're afraid I'm just gonna
pull my pistol, lean into you.

19:56.070 --> 20:00.532
All right, well, listen. Nobody
here is shooting nobody today.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.534
No guns.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.244
This here,
this is a fair fight.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.830
No jumping in neither,
all right?

20:06.914 --> 20:10.375
Man to man. Tubby, you hang
on to this. Don't eat it.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.296
There, now you have it.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.175
All right, come on.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.053
Let's get this over with.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.473
Everybody's waitin'.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.648
Son of a bitch.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.991
All right, $5 to the winner.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.536
What do you say to that?
Do you even have $5?

20:59.592 --> 21:02.260
Now wait just a minute.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.014
What...

21:07.141 --> 21:08.183
Is that?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.520
Is that...
Is that your dog?

21:19.445 --> 21:22.322
Come here, pooch.
Come here.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.875
Oh, dear.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.922
Hey!
Here he comes now, Gilly!

21:39.006 --> 21:40.256
Get away from my dog.

21:40.341 --> 21:41.508
Is that your wife?

21:41.842 --> 21:43.927
Roy, I've seen you with some
long in the tooth ladies,

21:44.011 --> 21:45.303
but this one here
takes the cake.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.429
You started this.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.639
And I'm gonna
finish it too.

21:52.353 --> 21:54.103
I don't care
where I am...

21:54.897 --> 21:56.689
And I don't care
who you think you are.

21:57.566 --> 22:00.193
Men like you don't scare me,
you understand?

22:01.779 --> 22:04.280
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

22:12.081 --> 22:13.790
I don't want any
trouble with y'all.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.292
Put it away.
Put it away.

22:16.377 --> 22:19.337
Harris, he just laid Gilly
out in front of half the town.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.130
We can't just...
Yes, we can.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.843
He's right, it was a
fair fight. It's settled.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.511
What do you think the
Marshal is gonna say

22:26.595 --> 22:28.012
when he finds out
we didn't do nothing?

22:28.097 --> 22:29.722
I imagine he'll be upset.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.684
We'll deal with it.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.438
He just spit on him.
He just spit on Gilly.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.359
Get up, kid.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.237
How's the pigs, Bill?

22:47.575 --> 22:50.159
Oh, my God, Gilly!

22:55.165 --> 22:57.333
He shouldn't have
threatened me or my dog.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.712
A man can only take so much. Yes, sir.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.840
How much for all of this?
No charge.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.593
I'm not a thief.
How much?

23:09.263 --> 23:10.680
I... I insist.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.350
What, you afraid of me?

23:16.478 --> 23:17.770
Yes, sir.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.982
That's...

23:24.445 --> 23:27.655
Tell you what, there's a
man out there who owes me $5.

23:28.699 --> 23:33.953
When he wakes up, you take
all this outta that, okay?

23:36.749 --> 23:38.082
Thank you.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.223
What are y'all
lookin' at? Go back inside!

23:54.308 --> 23:55.808
You should be ashamed
of yourselves!

23:57.269 --> 23:59.896
Oh, he's leaking, he's leaking!
Wait, why are we outside?

24:00.272 --> 24:04.233
Clean, clean him, he's
leaking. Come on, come on...

24:04.318 --> 24:05.777
Get up, get up.

24:06.570 --> 24:07.779
Gilly.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.782
Don't break my hat.

24:10.908 --> 24:14.077
Come on. Get up. There we go.
Okay.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.631
Sit down.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.509
Don't worry. We're okay.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.972
Coming! I'm coming!

24:35.933 --> 24:37.183
I'm sorry, I fell asleep.

24:37.267 --> 24:40.019
My sister should be down here,
I don't know where she is.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.397
I'll let her have it.
Ellen!

24:51.949 --> 24:54.075
Hi. What can I do for you?

24:55.244 --> 24:57.370
You got any, hot water?

24:58.247 --> 24:59.455
Sure do,
you want a bath?

24:59.540 --> 25:00.581
Yeah.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.795
Oh, my goodness, who is this?

25:08.716 --> 25:09.841
Hi there, cutie.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.427
What's your name?
Aren't you just precious.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.220
She do any tricks?

25:14.930 --> 25:16.180
She bites.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.765
Oh, she's not gonna bite me, look at us.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.434
We look just like each other.

25:23.397 --> 25:26.190
Anyways,
about that bath.

25:27.276 --> 25:28.609
You could use one.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.070
Yeah.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.699
Oh, my, what happened to
your hand? You're bleeding.

25:35.284 --> 25:36.617
Let me get you a rag.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.786
Oh, no, it's all right.
Just need some hot water.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.371
I know,
I know you want a bath.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.081
But I can't have you
painting my floors.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.460
Ellen!

25:46.420 --> 25:47.795
Where is she?

25:48.047 --> 25:49.797
She got red hair
and a white dress?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.300
Yeah, that's right.
Tall and dimwitted too.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.635
You know her?
She's outside.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.058
Figures. I swear
she's about as useful

26:00.142 --> 26:01.642
as a fork in a sugar
bowl around here.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.399
How'd you do this
to your hand anyway?

26:11.153 --> 26:13.654
Well, it was...
It was an accident.

26:17.326 --> 26:18.785
Hold that on there.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.334
It's okay. It's okay.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.089
Oh, my goodness!
Did you punch Gilly?

26:32.174 --> 26:34.592
Oh, my goodness. This is
the best day of my life.

26:36.512 --> 26:37.929
Let's get you right
on up to this bath.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.347
In fact,
let's get both of you a bath.

26:39.473 --> 26:40.765
Come on, whatever
your name is. Come on.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.018
Okay, here we go.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.271
Got some fresh towels
and a comb

26:47.356 --> 26:48.773
and brush if you
wanna wash your teeth.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.444
And one for you, Abbie.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.161
I hope you don't mind me
being in here for the moment.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.497
Trust me, I've seen it all.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.875
Not that I'm a whore
or nothin'. I'm not.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.210
This is just a hotel.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.461
So if you're
looking for someone

27:10.546 --> 27:11.712
to give it a rub,
you're out of luck.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.715
There's no women for sale here.
They all left with the silver.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.676
Can I get you
anything else?

27:18.554 --> 27:19.679
No.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.306
I can't believe I
missed you punching Gilly.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.225
I would've given anything
to have seen that.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.352
I gotta say, I'm just real
interested in who you are.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.355
We don't get many visitors anymore.
Not since the mine went dry.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.733
I spend more time sweeping
dust than I do prepping rooms.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.571
It's exciting to have someone
new to talk to. You a miner?

27:38.740 --> 27:39.824
No.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.242
You a cowboy?

27:42.244 --> 27:43.369
No.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.748
You a gunfighter?

27:49.042 --> 27:50.084
No.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.171
Is that 'cause you ain't, or
'cause no one's hired you yet?

27:53.255 --> 27:54.338
'Cause let me tell you,

27:54.423 --> 27:55.756
there are plenty of people
in this town that...

27:55.841 --> 27:57.258
I'm not a gunfighter.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.011
Well, what are you then?

28:00.262 --> 28:01.596
I'm passing through.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.348
Well, I know that.
Nobody stays.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.728
Not even my husband.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.610
Anyway, let me know when you're
done, I've got some coffee brewing.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.236
You do like coffee?

28:18.614 --> 28:21.240
Ah, well, good. At least
I got something right.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.788
Abbie, next time I'm just gonna talk
to you. You might have more to say.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.967
Where the hell is he?

28:40.802 --> 28:44.138
Mary-Anne, Mary-Anne, you
better not be serving that man.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.140
I am too,
you shut your mouth!

28:46.225 --> 28:47.475
I don't want him
hearing none of this.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.769
Did you see what he did
to Gilly? Look at my dress!

28:49.937 --> 28:51.771
The whole town
practically saw.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.982
Good! Gilly deserves some egg on
his face the way he treats people!

28:55.067 --> 28:56.234
Oh, you watch your mouth.

28:56.318 --> 28:58.653
No! I'll say what I want,
and I'll serve who I want.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.988
Dad said for us to run
this hotel, not just you.

29:01.782 --> 29:04.659
He could be a criminal.
So have some sense.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.327
Oh, Ellen, shut up.

29:06.453 --> 29:07.912
You let me worry about this.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.830
I think he's handsome
and I like his dog,

29:09.957 --> 29:11.332
and I wanna know
more about them both.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.834
I'm not scared, and you're
not gonna ruin this for me.

29:14.336 --> 29:15.586
You foolish little girl.

29:15.671 --> 29:18.005
One day you'll realize there's
no sense in being difficult.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.925
You make the best of what you
can. Now Gilly takes care of me.

29:21.635 --> 29:22.927
So every time
you put him down,

29:23.011 --> 29:25.012
you ought to remember
that he's why

29:25.097 --> 29:27.139
I'm always in nice
dresses and jewelry

29:27.516 --> 29:30.685
and you're still lookin' like
a little old farm girl.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.937
There's a reason we have it better
than most people in this town.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.522
So wise up.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.941
Maybe then you'll find someone
to take care of you too,

29:37.025 --> 29:38.943
but it's not gonna be
that man upstairs.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.778
Because he is a rapscallion

29:41.822 --> 29:43.531
and we
don't serve rapscallions.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.157
Well, maybe I
like rapscallions!

29:45.784 --> 29:48.327
Now go tend to that nincompoop
fiancé of yours and leave me be.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.037
Show him how he
ruined your dress.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.372
See if he buys you
a new one then.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.124
Maybe he can fix that
black tooth of yours

29:53.208 --> 29:54.709
while he's at it.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.046
Gilly! I'm coming, baby.

30:06.513 --> 30:08.556
What did I tell you
about staying out of trouble?

30:10.017 --> 30:11.058
Yeah, I know.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.687
Probably was all my fault.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.151
You know what Cathy'd say?

30:21.236 --> 30:23.029
She'd say, "You got sand...

30:23.822 --> 30:25.990
"But you could use a little
bit more in your mouth. "

30:28.535 --> 30:29.702
Ain't that funny?

30:36.418 --> 30:37.501
Shit.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.005
Fair fight or no fair fight,

30:42.591 --> 30:44.175
whatever law they
got in this town

30:44.259 --> 30:45.760
is gonna wanna
talk to us soon.

30:46.595 --> 30:50.097
So, we best be moving on.

30:57.064 --> 30:58.439
Thank you.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.712
From your description, I
expected you to be a lot taller.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.131
Have a seat.

31:26.093 --> 31:27.134
The coffee's ready.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.594
I thought you both
might like some.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.721
I have some pig-stew boiling
if you're hungry.

31:31.431 --> 31:32.890
Mary-Anne, sweetheart,

31:33.475 --> 31:34.809
find something else to do.

31:36.478 --> 31:37.937
Do you want me to
watch Abbie for you?

31:39.106 --> 31:40.147
No.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.649
Are you sure? I'll be real
nice to her, I promise.

31:41.775 --> 31:42.900
Mary-Anne!
Yes, sir?

31:42.984 --> 31:44.402
Move your feet.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.779
Yes, sir.

31:47.948 --> 31:50.074
Now you don't wanna sit,
that's fine.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.326
But all you're doing is
giving me a sore neck.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.082
See, I got to take the
weight off it once in a while.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.754
I'm not proud of it.

32:06.508 --> 32:09.468
That's a sweet doggie.
She do any tricks?

32:10.345 --> 32:11.762
She bites.

32:15.642 --> 32:18.102
All right.
Down to business, I guess.

32:19.187 --> 32:22.690
I am Clyde Martin. I am
the Marshal here in Denton.

32:23.525 --> 32:24.942
You got a badge?

32:29.114 --> 32:30.823
Damn pin broke.

32:32.159 --> 32:33.200
Satisfied?

32:37.038 --> 32:39.123
You busted up my deputy
pretty good.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.043
I had no idea
he was your deputy.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.048
I was just trying
to defend myself.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.175
I know you were.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.635
Nobody dare tell me that
'cause it's my son.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.388
And I know how he is.

32:55.390 --> 32:59.226
But defending or not, he's still
my son and he's my deputy too.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.479
So all of this is
kinda lousy for me.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.397
Well, I can't have
people thinking

33:03.482 --> 33:05.316
this kind of business
goes on around here.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.651
First the fight breaks out,
then another.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.403
And all the sudden
all hell breaks loose

33:09.529 --> 33:11.155
and everybody's
got something to say.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.658
This town's fallen
on some hard times.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.411
The last thing I need is a
stranger starting trouble.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.580
Yeah, but, I'm not
gonna cause any troubles.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.500
No. We're just, passin' through.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.251
Well, that's what I hear.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.379
Now is that your horse
over there at Bill's outfit?

33:28.215 --> 33:29.715
That's a McCIellan saddle.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.343
And would I be
right to suspect

33:32.427 --> 33:35.179
that that is
a Springfield trapdoor rifle

33:35.263 --> 33:36.764
that you got
tied up there too?

33:40.101 --> 33:41.769
I could throw you
in jail right now.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.605
You want that?
I don't think so.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.108
Only one reason I don't.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.444
And that's the two items
on your horse.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.112
'Cause what they tell me
is that you're just

33:52.197 --> 33:54.114
not another vagabond
or a criminal

33:54.199 --> 33:55.741
that I should be locking away.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.952
It tells me that you're army.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.454
But what it does not tell me

34:00.539 --> 34:03.290
is why the hell are you
all the way out here?

34:04.251 --> 34:05.793
Now last I heard,

34:05.877 --> 34:09.713
the cavalry was still busy killing
Injuns in Kansas and Oklahoma.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.466
Now we are a long way
from Kansas, soldier.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.467
You mind filling me in?

34:16.137 --> 34:17.721
We're leaving.

34:19.306 --> 34:20.641
Now just a minute.

34:24.603 --> 34:25.813
If you're a deserter,

34:25.938 --> 34:28.774
I have a duty as a US
Marshal to turn you in.

34:29.609 --> 34:30.900
I took an oath.

34:34.155 --> 34:38.826
But that would cause extra
attention that I don't want.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.996
You see, I have a way
of doing things around this town

34:43.081 --> 34:45.331
that some think of
as non-traditional.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.126
And I don't wanna
turn that upside down.

34:48.253 --> 34:49.503
And I have a feeling,

34:49.588 --> 34:51.797
neither of us want the
extra attention. Am I right?

34:53.300 --> 34:55.926
Frankly, I feel like I've
given the military enough.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.846
And from the looks
of it, so have you.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.098
And I have sympathy

35:01.182 --> 35:02.933
for men who
have fought in wars

35:03.018 --> 35:04.518
and even those who
have abandoned 'em.

35:06.354 --> 35:10.524
So, you find yourself another
town far away from here.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.527
One with fancy whores
and fine whiskey

35:14.362 --> 35:16.280
and a chink
with a pot of opium

35:16.364 --> 35:18.782
that's just begging for a man
like you to come into his life.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.951
You do what you need to do.

35:21.703 --> 35:23.037
I expect you earned it.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.042
But don't you ever,

35:28.126 --> 35:31.211
if I ever hear a whispering
of you or that dog

35:31.296 --> 35:33.213
being even near
these parts again,

35:33.298 --> 35:35.633
you'll be begging
for the army to come get ya.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.677
But they won't.
They won't ever find you.

35:39.054 --> 35:42.723
Nobody will.
Are we clear on that, soldier?

35:47.312 --> 35:48.896
All right, fellas.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.065
Our visitors have
decided to leave.

35:51.191 --> 35:54.693
They are ready to move on.
So please see that they do so.

35:55.236 --> 35:58.614
And Mary-Anne? I believe I
will have some of that stew.

35:59.074 --> 36:04.078
Oh, and my understanding is,
Harris, it was a fair fight.

36:04.454 --> 36:05.537
Yeah.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.915
So don't bring any aggravating
on this no more.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.375
And tell Gilly that too.

36:10.418 --> 36:14.755
His nose is gonna heal up
like a crooked boot,

36:15.757 --> 36:17.466
but he's gonna
have to accept that.

36:19.636 --> 36:22.221
Maybe he'll even learn something
from all this, I don't know.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.932
All right, you're dismissed.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.569
Well, all right.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.464
I know you're not
coming back, but...

36:57.841 --> 36:59.633
I just wanna say
it was nice meeting you today.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.137
I wanted to give you this.

37:04.013 --> 37:05.806
You can fold it or rip
off Ellen's part

37:05.932 --> 37:07.349
if you don't wanna
look at her.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.185
I just thought
maybe you could...

37:10.311 --> 37:12.646
Remember me sometimes when you
get wherever you're going.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.651
Mary-Anne!

37:22.949 --> 37:26.326
Well, goodbye. Heck, I
don't even know your name.

37:30.331 --> 37:31.665
My name's Paul.

37:36.296 --> 37:37.629
Well, goodbye, Paul.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.935
Good girl.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.778
You know what
Cathy used to say

39:24.904 --> 39:26.989
one of the greatest things
about Mexico was?

39:29.117 --> 39:30.576
Nobody speaks any English.

39:33.580 --> 39:34.955
Oh, shit.

39:35.790 --> 39:38.292
I'll tell you what though.
One thing I did realize today?

39:39.252 --> 39:41.169
Is that words don't
come so easy anymore.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.214
I'm so used to talking to you

39:44.299 --> 39:46.633
that I barely know what to say
when somebody talks back.

39:48.595 --> 39:49.845
You speak Spanish?

39:53.474 --> 39:54.516
Yeah.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.436
Come here. Come here.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.814
What'd you think
of that girl today?

40:01.816 --> 40:03.483
I thought she was
pretty funny.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.695
No, she was
nothing like Cathy.

40:08.615 --> 40:11.575
When I first met Cathy I couldn't
get three words outta her.

40:11.659 --> 40:14.828
You know, she only spoke if she
had something meaningful to say.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.498
But this one.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.042
Shit.

40:20.877 --> 40:23.337
She'd speak every time
she wasn't taking a breath.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.050
No...

40:29.469 --> 40:31.219
She's young enough
to be my daughter.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.976
She was funny though,
didn't you think?

40:45.026 --> 40:46.318
I thought she was funny.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.866
Not as funny as you,
don't worry.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.082
All right,
let's go to bed.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.515
Don't you want your blanket?

41:55.096 --> 41:56.930
Be quiet.

41:59.225 --> 42:01.143
Don't make a sound
in case he wakes up.

42:03.438 --> 42:04.771
You sure he's asleep?

42:05.440 --> 42:07.649
God damn it, Tubby.
Just do what I say.

42:08.735 --> 42:09.818
Cut him off.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.822
Gilly,
I don't know about this.

42:14.323 --> 42:16.950
Harris, go. Now.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.333
Abbie, quiet down.

42:28.838 --> 42:30.255
Come here.

42:39.974 --> 42:41.683
Where'd it go? Where is it?

42:43.102 --> 42:45.812
No, no.

42:46.147 --> 42:47.439
I can't see where you're hit.

42:47.523 --> 42:51.485
Oh, it's okay. It's okay. Where you
hit? I can't find where you're hit.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.153
Bullseye.

43:12.298 --> 43:13.340
All right.

43:14.050 --> 43:15.842
Listen to me.
She needs my help.

43:15.968 --> 43:18.303
Okay, just, you can
have whatever you want.

43:18.387 --> 43:20.388
Please let me just
make sure that she's okay.

43:26.187 --> 43:29.064
Now you shut up.
You are not in charge.

43:30.191 --> 43:31.900
All right, I'm not in charge.
That's fine.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.652
Just... Just please let me
make sure that she's okay.

43:33.736 --> 43:36.113
You back away from
her or I will kill her.

43:36.197 --> 43:37.864
It's...
Back up.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.032
Okay.

43:41.369 --> 43:42.953
Oh, no, no, no.

43:43.037 --> 43:44.621
The Marshal told you
to leave me alone!

43:44.705 --> 43:46.039
The Marshal ain't here.

43:46.165 --> 43:49.292
No! Oh, God damn,
you're making a mistake!

43:49.377 --> 43:51.086
I am going to murder you!

43:51.212 --> 43:54.005
I am going to murder
all of you, I swear to God!

43:54.090 --> 43:56.049
God!

43:57.009 --> 43:58.218
There ain't no God here.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.722
And there ain't
nobody here but us.

44:08.062 --> 44:11.898
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

44:13.276 --> 44:14.943
My dad said...

44:15.444 --> 44:18.738
That this is probably
an Injun's dog.

44:18.865 --> 44:21.950
He most likely got her off a pack
of Cheyenne out there in Kansas.

44:22.702 --> 44:26.538
Cheyenne, who raped
and killed white folk.

44:28.374 --> 44:29.624
Did you steal this dog?

44:31.878 --> 44:35.755
Please. Please. Don't do this.

44:36.424 --> 44:39.593
Okay, please. Please don't do
this 'cause of what happened today.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.971
I mean, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

44:44.098 --> 44:45.432
You answer my questions...

44:46.559 --> 44:48.727
And maybe I will
consider your request.

44:50.104 --> 44:51.813
Now did you kill
her tribe or not?

44:53.983 --> 44:55.108
Come on, now.

44:55.234 --> 44:57.235
There ain't nobody here
that's gonna snitch on you.

44:57.820 --> 45:01.031
Nah. See, we all
heard the stories,

45:01.115 --> 45:02.490
we just ain't
never had a chance

45:02.617 --> 45:04.242
to talk to somebody
in the flesh.

45:05.286 --> 45:06.328
Tell us about it!

45:07.663 --> 45:10.165
You want us to
believe that you were

45:10.291 --> 45:13.627
the one man in the cavalry
too good for all of it?

45:14.128 --> 45:16.796
Shit, I hope that you
killed every last one

45:16.923 --> 45:18.798
of those wagon burners
that you saw.

45:19.467 --> 45:20.926
That's what I would have done.

45:21.510 --> 45:24.304
Those goddamn savages
deserve nothing less.

45:24.639 --> 45:26.973
Please leave us alone. Please.

45:27.516 --> 45:28.850
How many?

45:29.310 --> 45:33.104
I don't know!
I don't remember!

45:33.189 --> 45:34.981
I wanna go to Mexico.

45:35.107 --> 45:36.983
You'll never see me again!

45:37.109 --> 45:39.527
I swear, please.
Take whatever you want.

45:40.112 --> 45:42.656
Oh, no. No.

45:42.990 --> 45:45.075
You see, we ain't
here to rob you.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.953
You're the thief.
Not us.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.331
Yeah.
What do you say, fellas?

45:51.666 --> 45:54.542
Suppose we let this thief and
this traitor run off to Mexico?

45:54.669 --> 45:56.336
I don't think so.

45:56.879 --> 45:58.338
I don't think so, neither.

46:01.133 --> 46:02.509
You're awfully quiet, Harris.

46:04.679 --> 46:07.013
Look, Gilly...
Yes or no, Harris?

46:15.690 --> 46:17.107
Well, that's a shame.

46:17.191 --> 46:19.859
Because I vote no, too.
So that's...

46:20.528 --> 46:22.028
Four to one.

46:23.197 --> 46:26.241
Please! She needs me.

46:26.367 --> 46:28.994
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you. I'll...

46:29.203 --> 46:32.497
Oh, no, begging ain't
gonna do you no good.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.542
See, it ain't
a time for begging.

46:36.836 --> 46:38.128
It's time for praying.

46:39.797 --> 46:42.549
You are a coward.

46:43.467 --> 46:45.802
You left good men behind.

46:45.886 --> 46:48.972
They trusted you and
you ran out on them!

46:49.557 --> 46:51.141
What if they needed you?

46:53.561 --> 46:55.395
Just like this dog here...

46:56.147 --> 46:57.230
Needs you.

46:57.940 --> 47:02.902
I think that it's time
that someone let you know

47:02.987 --> 47:04.738
what that feels like.

47:05.990 --> 47:07.782
No!

47:08.743 --> 47:10.577
Help! Help!

47:11.829 --> 47:13.121
Get him up.
Get him on his feet.

47:13.247 --> 47:14.956
Get up, you motherfucker.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.680
Nah, nah.

47:30.765 --> 47:32.432
I ain't gonna cut you.

47:32.808 --> 47:36.478
Looks like somebody
already did that.

47:38.773 --> 47:42.442
But you will remember me.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.945
You will remember my name.

47:47.114 --> 47:50.617
And the last thing
that you will remember

47:51.827 --> 47:55.121
is that you shoulda never
come up against Gilly Martin.

47:56.123 --> 47:57.624
You're a disgrace.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.834
Get this coward
out of my sight.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.378
You're dead.

48:01.462 --> 48:04.297
You're dead, too. All of
you are dead.

48:04.507 --> 48:07.759
I think you got that wrong.
I think it's you who's dead.

48:09.637 --> 48:12.639
That's a long way down.

48:13.974 --> 48:15.809
Now let him go, Harris.

48:16.310 --> 48:17.727
Harris!

48:18.354 --> 48:19.813
Let him go.

48:20.523 --> 48:22.148
Adiós, stranger.

48:23.359 --> 48:24.484
Let go.

48:28.989 --> 48:31.241
You see him bounce
off that rock there?

48:32.326 --> 48:33.785
I didn't see where he landed.

48:33.869 --> 48:35.495
I did. On the bottom.

48:36.539 --> 48:38.665
Well, you better go down there
and make sure he's dead.

48:39.166 --> 48:41.584
You crazy?
I'm not climbing down there.

48:41.669 --> 48:44.838
You hear that? Tubby
ain't climbing down there.

48:47.508 --> 48:48.716
Damn!

48:51.720 --> 48:52.846
Hey, you two.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.515
You take his horse and you go
through his bags and you hurry up.

48:55.599 --> 48:58.268
I wanna get back to town
before my dad knows we're gone.

49:01.021 --> 49:04.065
Harris! You gonna stand there
all night or what?

51:50.941 --> 51:52.525
Get outta here!

52:00.367 --> 52:01.826
I'm so sorry.

52:03.412 --> 52:05.413
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

53:01.929 --> 53:03.888
I'm not sure what
you'd want me to do.

53:08.185 --> 53:11.354
I could just keep heading down
to Mexico, like we planned.

53:19.446 --> 53:22.115
I know I promised you
that I was done killing.

53:26.245 --> 53:28.413
But I think I'm gonna have
to break that promise.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.626
I'm not done...

53:34.545 --> 53:35.670
Not yet.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.842
And it's not done
with me either.

53:46.807 --> 53:48.641
Those men left me
with nothing...

53:54.565 --> 53:56.399
I'm gonna leave them
with less.

54:46.784 --> 54:48.159
Hey, hold up, boy.

55:00.047 --> 55:01.422
Oh, God.

55:03.258 --> 55:05.885
Don't come any closer.

55:22.277 --> 55:24.362
I thought
I took your bullets.

55:26.448 --> 55:27.698
I bought more.

55:28.075 --> 55:29.617
What's a priest need
so many bullets for?

55:30.369 --> 55:31.661
Sinners.

55:34.665 --> 55:37.667
I'm gonna need your belt.
And I'm taking your mule.

55:38.252 --> 55:39.752
I thought you said
you weren't a thief.

55:40.087 --> 55:41.712
Now you're thieving
me gun and me mule.

55:42.005 --> 55:43.798
Yeah, times have changed.

55:44.383 --> 55:45.466
Give me that.

55:47.427 --> 55:48.511
What happened to you?

55:49.179 --> 55:52.974
Well, let's just say the Marshal
in Denton wasn't keen to my cause.

55:53.725 --> 55:55.852
Told me I'd need to pay
if I wanted to preach

55:55.936 --> 55:58.396
and said he didn't see the need
for the word of God in his town.

55:58.522 --> 56:00.773
Yeah, well, I bet he didn't.

56:00.983 --> 56:03.818
I tell you, if this country
keeps turning its back on faith,

56:03.902 --> 56:05.236
there'll be nothing
worth left saving.

56:05.320 --> 56:08.197
Well, you're right about that,
Father, you are right about that.

56:10.450 --> 56:11.784
This country's all but lost.

56:12.327 --> 56:13.995
You're right about
something else, too.

56:14.454 --> 56:16.998
That town back there,
it's full of sinners...

56:19.459 --> 56:21.085
But they don't need saving.

56:24.756 --> 56:26.257
Bless you, my son.

57:20.729 --> 57:22.188
This is my father's house.

57:24.107 --> 57:25.232
He's sick.

57:28.445 --> 57:29.528
You got a family?

57:32.157 --> 57:33.366
Not anymore.

57:35.285 --> 57:36.619
They die?

57:37.412 --> 57:38.454
No.

57:58.266 --> 57:59.725
Are you gonna
kill those men?

58:00.268 --> 58:01.727
'Cause I could help.

58:03.021 --> 58:04.605
They deserve to die
for what they've done to you

58:04.690 --> 58:06.357
and for what they've done
to this town.

58:06.441 --> 58:08.734
I could tell you where to find
them. I could do that for you.

58:09.945 --> 58:11.821
The Marshal and Gilly
got everybody scared.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.448
They say if you aren't with
them, you're against them.

58:14.783 --> 58:16.409
And a lotta people here
took that to heart.

58:16.785 --> 58:18.911
There's nobody brave enough
to stand up to them anymore.

58:19.746 --> 58:21.372
You've killed before,
haven't you?

58:25.502 --> 58:28.087
What I mean is,
you was in wars.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.926
I can tell by the way you
don't wanna look me in the eye.

58:35.345 --> 58:37.138
You don't want me to know
what you're capable of,

58:37.222 --> 58:39.223
but I wanna know, I wanna
know that you'll get them.

58:43.645 --> 58:46.397
After it's done, stay with
me until I bury my father.

58:47.399 --> 58:49.191
Then I'll go with you
anywhere, please.

58:49.985 --> 58:52.486
I know how to treat a man.
I know what a husband likes...

58:52.571 --> 58:53.904
Stop it.

58:54.823 --> 58:57.158
Please take me with you,
I need to get outta here.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.160
There are no good men
left in this town.

58:59.244 --> 59:00.578
I'm not here to save you.

59:01.830 --> 59:03.581
I'm not here to save anybody.

59:03.874 --> 59:07.043
Don't say that, you don't
have to be alone. Yes, I do.

59:08.420 --> 59:10.254
You imagine that
you know who I am

59:10.338 --> 59:12.048
just 'cause you think
everybody outside this town

59:12.132 --> 59:13.299
has it better than you,

59:14.051 --> 59:16.302
that other people somehow
aren't suffering the same.

59:16.386 --> 59:17.803
Well, you're wrong about that.

59:19.473 --> 59:22.224
It's a big old world.
Everybody's suffering.

59:23.810 --> 59:27.354
I had a wife named Cathy.

59:28.815 --> 59:32.151
I had a daughter named Abilene

59:33.153 --> 59:35.654
and she was real
pretty and smart,

59:37.157 --> 59:38.282
just like you.

59:39.409 --> 59:41.911
What happened to them?
I left them.

59:43.038 --> 59:45.998
Now, I'm sorry for the hand
you've been dealt, truly I am.

59:47.542 --> 59:49.710
But I can't stay here
and help you bury your father

59:49.795 --> 59:51.837
and run you off
to someplace better.

59:53.965 --> 59:55.800
I'm not the man
you see in your head.

59:57.302 --> 01:00:00.096
I deserted my family
the day I enlisted

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.556
and I ain't been nothing but
a coward for not going back.

01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:05.101
I don't even
wanna see their faces,

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.562
not after what I've done.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.659
Paul...

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:27.456
You seem like a good girl,
all right, you do, I mean that.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:28.749
A good man

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:31.460
will be proud to be
with a woman like you.

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:35.798
All right, but I'm not
a good man, not anymore.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.843
I'm taking your horse.

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:45.057
You think just because
I'm young I must be naïve.

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.351
I've spent my whole life helping
people who can't help themselves

01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:48.978
and what is there
to show for it?

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.773
You're not a good man?
Well, I am good!

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:54.525
So why should I be
punished for that?

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.235
You act like everybody's
given up on you,

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.820
but you've just
given up on yourself.

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:02.575
You might be suffering,
but you're not dead, not yet.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.285
You're not even sick
like my father in there.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.912
You could still
go back to them,

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:10.499
your family,
they'd understand.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.169
I'm sure your wife and daughter
would wanna see you again.

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:17.339
Mary-Anne, how would you feel
about seeing your husband again?

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:22.178
We're not meant
to be alone, Paul.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:24.972
People, we belong together,
just like animals in a herd.

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:26.891
Just like you and Abbie.

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:30.561
Abbie's dead, Mary-Anne.

01:01:32.564 --> 01:01:33.898
I wish you well.

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:35.524
Come on.

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:06.722
God damn it, you stink.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.851
Oh, Jesus. Ellen, sweetheart, will
you make sure that Roy here gets a bath,

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:12.061
I can't even be in
the same room with him.

01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:13.187
I sure will.

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:17.566
See now, what he's not used
to is the smell of a real man.

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:19.944
I mean, I can make babies
with this shit.

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:22.655
Y'all just don't know.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:24.281
God, you are sour!

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:27.034
All right, I'm gonna go help Tubby
collect the rest of the taxes.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.869
Maybe later I'll
bring you something nice.

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:30.788
Something nice?
I'd like that.

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:32.831
I thought you would.
Make sure he don't drown,

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.458
he's like a cat to water.
I may need him.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:35.960
I'll see to it.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.221
Ellen!

01:03:04.072 --> 01:03:05.948
Ellen, where are you?

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:09.785
Stop shouting, I'm right
here, you're so loud.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.579
What do you want? I thought
you was out with Dad.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.123
I need to talk with you.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.624
He didn't die, did he?

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.543
No, not yet.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.129
Oh, thank God.
Not like you'd care.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.965
Mary-Anne, how dare you say
something like that to me.

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:25.801
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that,
but please, it's important.

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:28.220
Roy is in 353 and
he needs hot water.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:30.347
Go warm him up and
then we can talk about

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:32.224
whatever nonsense you got
in your mind this time.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.476
I'll be in our room.
Don't let that man get cold.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:37.479
Ellen!
Nope.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:39.315
Fine, I'll get him
the damn water.

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:40.733
And a shave kit.

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.235
His chin is looking like
a nasty old billy goat.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.531
And don't you dare
tell him I said that.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.873
Yeah, what is it?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.043
Got some more hot
water and a kit for a shave.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:02.046
Yeah, well, bring it in.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:23.650
Oh, I feel real good.

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.448
How old are you now?

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.075
Sixteen.

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:37.081
You know that husband of yours
never coming back, right?

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:38.999
I mean, you're old enough
to know that by now.

01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:40.876
Yes, sir.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.253
You're real pretty,
like your sister.

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:47.132
You ought to find a new man.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.719
One with connections...

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.264
And a home
outside of this hotel.

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:59.395
You know, you don't wanna wait
till your looks grow out.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:09.655
No shave today.
I think I'll keep the beard.

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:40.120
You back already?

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.832
Why don't you just...

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:47.044
Slip that little
dress of yours off

01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:50.506
and climb right into
the tub here with me?

01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:54.718
The water's real nice.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.056
I don't want you to be shy.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.439
I said no shave today.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:12.277
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.696
Put your arms in the tub.
Put your arms in the water.

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:19.493
I told you I'd find you,
didn't I?

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:24.540
And before you start
asking for anything,

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:28.460
there's not gonna be
any sympathy today.

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:31.755
Now get your arms
back in the water.

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:33.298
Put 'em in the water.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:37.553
Now listen to me.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:41.223
I didn't come here today
with any compassion at all.

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:46.311
The four of you killed my dog
and you tried to kill me.

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:51.149
Now, it was a mistake
to leave me alive.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.235
I'm not gonna
make that mistake.

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:56.071
I've killed more human beings
than I care to remember.

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:59.366
And I will not hesitate

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:03.620
or quit until the four
of you are in the dirt.

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:10.502
Now take a deep breath.
And that's your last.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.733
Mary-Anne,
what's goin' on?

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:47.663
Mary-Anne? Mary-Anne?

01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:50.917
Mary-Anne, what is it?

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:53.252
Oh, my God.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.426
Oh, my God. Roy.

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:31.792
Roy?

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.002
Oh, Lord.

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:41.218
Tubby, catch your
breath somewhere else

01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:43.553
and get away from
the goddamn window.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:45.930
Yes, sir.

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:52.479
What happened? You went
after that man, didn't ya?

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.065
I told you not to.
I made it perfectly clear

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:57.150
that you were not to
aggravate the situation.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:59.695
But ya did, didn't ya?
All of ya did.

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:01.446
We couldn't let him
get away with what he did.

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:04.157
It would have made us look weak. Weak?

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:06.326
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:09.329
You think that I let him
go 'cause I'm weak? No.

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:12.416
Look at this.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.459
That's not done by
an angry drunk

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.586
or a minor that has
a sense of entitlement.

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:18.296
This was done by
a military man.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.465
A man trained to kill
by one of the most

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.718
ruthless divisions our
country has ever seen.

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:24.594
Something you would
know nothin' about.

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:27.431
And you think just 'cause
you got a prick and a pistol

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:28.849
you can kill somebody?

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:31.309
Well, get a look at death.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.854
Take a look at it.

01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:35.689
If you'd done what I said,

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:38.734
Roy wouldn't be breathing out of
his neck right now.

01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:42.070
Give me that cane.

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:44.865
Stop. Just stop!

01:10:45.825 --> 01:10:47.784
Marshal.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.202
Stop it!
Marshal!

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:51.246
We thought he was dead.
Honest.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:52.706
I don't know how
he could've survived.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.833
I told you we should
have gone down there, made sure.

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:56.543
Oh, shut up. Both of you.

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:58.295
Y'all should have
known better than

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:00.172
to let him get away with
something like this.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.673
Why the hell am I
even paying you?

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.049
Now, which one of
you girls seen him?

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.010
Well, we both did.

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:07.304
He have a gun?
I don't know.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:09.431
It happened so fast.
All I saw was blood.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:11.767
Mary-Anne, did you see if
he had a gun? Mary-Anne?

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:13.852
I don't know.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:17.272
Now, think hard. It's important
you say the right thing.

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:19.733
People's lives
are depending on it.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:21.610
I don't know, Marshal.
Honest.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:28.533
All right. Harris,
get over to the jailhouse.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:30.952
Lock up all the guns and get
up on the roof with a rifle.

01:11:31.662 --> 01:11:33.663
Now, if we're lucky,
he's not armed.

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:36.541
But if he is, it's gonna get
worse before it gets better.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:39.753
Now, Gilly, you make sure you
get them girls someplace safe.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.588
And Tubby, you come with me.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.840
Why do I have to stay
with the women?

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:47.677
You almost got us
all killed today.

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:52.224
Now, I would appreciate it if you
didn't act on every idiotic thought

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:55.352
that comes into your mind and
just do what I say from now on.

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:58.563
We don't know if this man is
deranged. We don't know what he's done.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:02.234
Anybody could be next including
the women. So get them safe.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:03.944
Now! Get!

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:10.408
Move!

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:14.746
Marshal, what about Roy?

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:20.293
We don't have time to dig a
hole. Let's just let him soak.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:11.052
Now, if he's out there
and he's got a gun,

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:14.055
most likely one of us
is gonna take a bullet.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:18.768
And since I've already been shot in
this life, I think you ought to go first.

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:22.188
Why do we have
to go out there?

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:24.983
Because you don't run from
battle with a man like this.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.693
Hesitation will
get you killed.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:29.654
It's the stick
or the whip.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:31.323
Either way I want
a fighting chance.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:33.825
And I've got a shotgun waiting
for me in that jailhouse

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.201
and I intend to use it.

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:36.786
So, you go from door
to door and make sure

01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:38.330
he ain't hiding out
with anybody.

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:40.707
Now we gotta move fast.

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:44.502
We ain't gonna
wait here to die.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:47.547
We're gonna take it to him.
Do you understand what I mean?

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.593
Yes, sir.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:54.179
Now, you be careful
'cause you're a big target.

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:58.892
Gilly,
why is this happening?

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:00.977
God, that man,
he was covered in blood.

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:02.771
Looked like he
had on red gloves.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:04.814
Why would he do that?
Poor Roy.

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:07.442
Poor Roy. He didn't deserve
this... Ellen. Ellen...

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:10.320
Be quiet.

01:14:10.738 --> 01:14:12.197
I need to think right now.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:15.659
And you are grinding down my
ears with all of your babbling.

01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:18.995
My babbling? My babbling?

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.247
Gilly, he almost
took Roy's head off.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:26.211
I know, Ellen. I saw.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.088
I looked down his throat.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:30.340
But you going on
and on about it

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:32.467
ain't helping me
sort any of this out.

01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:34.552
You're gonna kill him, right?

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:37.013
You and the others, I mean,
he can't get away with this.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.390
He can't.
Ellen...

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:40.475
What did I just say?
Or maybe he's gone.

01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:43.186
Maybe he killed Roy
and he just moved on.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:46.606
Yeah. Yeah. We don't know for
sure that he's even still here.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.150
He's not moving on.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:51.361
They killed his dog.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:53.446
What?
That's why he's back.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.281
That's why Roy's dead.

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.451
He's not going anywhere until
he gets even with all of you.

01:14:58.536 --> 01:14:59.995
You shouldn't have
done what you done.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:02.664
How did you know
about that?

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:08.211
How did you know
about his dog?

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:10.839
You talked to him,
didn't you?

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.883
Are you helping him?
Mary-Anne,

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:15.635
is that what you were
trying to tell me earlier?

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:17.512
You knew this man
was coming?

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:19.931
You knew this would happen,
and you didn't say nothing?

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:21.725
I did say something.
You didn't listen.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.685
Gilly, Gilly. Gilly!

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:25.311
Shut up, Ellen!

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:29.524
I'm talking to your sister.

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:34.696
Now, are you helping him?

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:44.372
You answer me.
Are you helping him?

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:49.711
No. He didn't want my help.

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:51.880
But I would have, though.

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:58.219
Gilly! Gilly! No.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:00.472
Ellen, get off of me.

01:16:00.931 --> 01:16:02.724
Enough!

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.350
Enough.

01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:07.979
I should shoot
the both of you right now.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.899
But I need all the fucking
bullets that I have in this gun

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.567
for that asshole out there.

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:16.946
So you lie there and you ache.
And you lie there and you bleed.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:22.077
But the both of you,
please shut up.

01:16:38.969 --> 01:16:40.470
All clear now.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:42.722
And just move on
down the line like I said.

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:45.141
Do it quick 'cause
I'll be right behind you.

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.356
And you're sweatin' a lot.
You all right?

01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:55.318
You're not gonna pass out
on me or nothin', are you?

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:57.862
No, sir.

01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:02.700
I just sweat sometimes
on account of my biology.

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.472
Shoot 'em.

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:26.850
Shoot 'em both.

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:30.728
Mister...

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:34.691
I'm real sorry
for what we done.

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:38.403
I told Gilly,
but he just wouldn't listen.

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:41.281
He ain't reasonable
when he's like that.

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:43.825
But you remember,
though, right?

01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:48.371
You remember I didn't
want to do this to you.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:52.709
Shoot 'em...

01:17:53.878 --> 01:17:54.919
Or I'll shoot you.

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:05.513
On a count of three now.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.265
Yes, sir.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.766
You can do this.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:11.644
Yes, sir.

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:13.188
Move straight out.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:16.983
Yes, sir.

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:19.819
All right.

01:18:19.904 --> 01:18:21.112
One.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:24.449
Two.

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:27.911
Yes, sir.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:32.749
Three.

01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:33.917
Go.

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:35.168
Go!

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:44.761
No!

01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:46.262
What are you doing?

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:48.264
That's Tubby,
God damn it!

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:49.432
Don't shoot.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:50.642
What the...

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:55.230
Tubby, you hit?

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.732
Shoot them now.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:18:59.525
They're getting away.

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.027
Shoot them.

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:02.570
Come on. Get up!

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:04.697
I can't,
I don't want to die.

01:19:04.782 --> 01:19:06.991
Look, I don't
want to die neither.

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:12.288
Get up!

01:19:18.963 --> 01:19:20.004
I can't.

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:22.548
I can't shoot 'em.

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:03.631
I know there's not
a lot of dignity in this.

01:20:06.927 --> 01:20:10.138
But I have a daughter
I'd like to see again.

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.644
But I don't suppose
I ever will.

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:38.207
Harris?

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:47.342
Get away from the window.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:50.678
He's still on the roof.
We can trap him.

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:52.138
You move in front
of the building.

01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:53.389
I'll cut him off
in the back.

01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:54.557
But we got to move fast.

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:56.601
This is our only chance.
We can't blow it.

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.121
Shoot.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.042
Did I get you?

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:24.379
No!

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:28.674
I'm not here for you,
Marshal.

01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:32.678
I'm here for the men
who killed my dog!

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:34.389
Shit.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:36.974
God damn it, Gilly.

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:40.103
Well, I didn't
know about that.

01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:43.356
But I can't
allow this to go on.

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:47.610
Now, I wouldn't be much of a
father if I let you kill my son.

01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:51.823
And I wouldn't be much of a marshal
if I let you kill anyone else.

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:59.747
Well, if you get in my way,
I'm gonna take you down.

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:01.916
Yeah.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.793
I suppose you will.

01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:07.338
Well, the feeling's mutual.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:18.057
Tubby,
how long does it take you

01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:20.601
to get your fat ass
around that building?

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.356
I'm coming to get you.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:28.109
I'm coming to get you.

01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:47.211
Shit.

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.720
That's it. I'm going out there.
No. No.

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.138
No, you can't leave us here.

01:22:57.222 --> 01:22:58.431
The hell I can't.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.349
He's not after you,
he's after me.

01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:02.768
She said it, you remember? He's crazy.

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:05.855
And the Marshal
told you to protect us.

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:09.609
And I'm your fiancée, you don't
just up and leave your fiancée.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:13.362
Ellen, right now
I wouldn't care

01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:15.448
if you were
the tip of my dick!

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:16.699
I am going out there.

01:23:16.783 --> 01:23:18.868
You forget about
what my dad said,

01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:20.995
because he doesn't care
about either of you.

01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:23.247
He just doesn't think that
I can handle it on my own.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:24.373
But I'm gonna end it,

01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:27.043
and I am gonna prove to him
what I am capable of!

01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:30.671
Now you get away from the door
before I put another hole in you.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.131
Move!

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:34.884
Gilly,

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:37.803
I'm pregnant.

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:43.059
Please don't
leave me alone here.

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:45.311
I can't lose you.

01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:48.648
I can't have this baby
all by myself.

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:54.028
I need you?

01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:58.115
Ellen.

01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:03.746
Do you honestly think

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:09.835
that now is the right time
for this conversation?

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:13.714
Are you seriously
bringing this up right now?

01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:16.092
Yes.

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:19.971
There is a man outside who is
systematically trying to kill

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.640
everyone that I know,
including my father!

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:25.685
And you've decided
that now is a good time

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:28.020
to tell me that
you are pregnant?

01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:31.774
Gilly. Gilly.
Ellen!

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:33.985
Come on. Why?
Ellen!

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:35.361
Stop talking.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:40.366
The worst thing that you could do
right now is to say another word.

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:41.909
Let him go, Ellen.

01:24:41.994 --> 01:24:43.202
He wants to die, let him.

01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:45.288
You know what? Maybe I
can spare one more bullet.

01:24:45.372 --> 01:24:47.707
No, no, please.
Please, Gilly, don't.

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:49.667
I love you, I love you,
I'm just so scared.

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.210
I'm scared, please.

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:52.587
Please.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:58.926
There is no denying that
the two of you are related.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:01.470
You truly are pathetic.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:04.765
Both of you.

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:31.042
What the hell's
wrong with you?

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:32.251
Couldn't you hear me
yelling out there,

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:34.795
waiting for your fat ass
to get around the building?

01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:37.340
Get away from the window!

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:39.300
How many times do
I got to tell you?

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:43.471
Tubby!
It's Harris's face.

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:44.722
It's gone.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:45.973
What?

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:47.141
His whole face is gone.

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:48.643
What are we gonna
tell his wife and kid?

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:50.978
How are we gonna tell them
he got no face no more?

01:25:51.063 --> 01:25:52.188
And Roy?

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:55.358
He's up there pruning
in a tub of his own blood.

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:58.110
I can't do this, Marshal.

01:25:58.570 --> 01:25:59.987
I'm sorry.

01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:01.155
I just can't.
Okay.

01:26:01.239 --> 01:26:02.531
It's a lot to take.

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:05.576
I didn't know it
would be like this.

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:06.911
All right, now, Tubby.

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:08.329
Stop calling me Tubby!

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.414
I don't want to be
called that anymore.

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:11.749
I'm not even that fat!

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:14.377
You all act like all I do
is sit around eating all day.

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:16.879
I don't! I work!

01:26:16.963 --> 01:26:19.048
And I eat less than you all.

01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:21.175
This is just
the way God made me.

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:22.677
And I accept that.

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:24.428
But if I'm gonna
die here today,

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.097
I am not gonna
be called Tubby.

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:27.807
I mean it!

01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:32.520
Now, look, I will call you whatever
you want if we just get through this.

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:33.771
But please...

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:34.980
Lawrence!

01:26:35.065 --> 01:26:37.817
My name is Lawrence!

01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:41.153
All right, Lawrence.

01:26:41.238 --> 01:26:45.700
Larry, please,
for the love of God,

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:48.327
get away from
the goddamn window!

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:51.747
Fuck!

01:26:51.832 --> 01:26:53.082
Son of a bitch!

01:26:55.085 --> 01:26:56.961
Marshal!

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:59.588
This doesn't
have to concern you.

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.968
You don't have to die today.

01:27:06.179 --> 01:27:09.849
But you're gonna have
to have a real good long think

01:27:09.933 --> 01:27:12.768
about where you stand
from here on out.

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:25.281
Come on, come on,
come on, you cocksucker.

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:27.116
Just let me see your face.

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:36.041
All right.
I'm beat. Let's talk.

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:39.712
But if I come out,

01:27:39.796 --> 01:27:42.214
are you gonna talk
or are you gonna shoot?

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:45.968
I'm prepared for both.

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:50.264
Well, that doesn't
make me feel comfortable.

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:52.933
Well,
you got a gun, Marshal?

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:55.019
You know I do.

01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:57.062
Better leave it behind.

01:27:59.649 --> 01:28:03.736
Well, if I come out unarmed,
how do I know you won't shoot?

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:05.446
Well, you don't.

01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:08.365
What better option
you got?

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:14.038
Well, I can see your point.

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:39.188
No gun.

01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:42.817
No gun.

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:46.487
What the hell is he doing?

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:49.698
Where's your son?

01:28:51.618 --> 01:28:52.827
I don't know.

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:56.622
But I just don't want
anyone else hurt.

01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:07.049
Now you got to know that this is a
deeply embarrassing moment for me.

01:29:08.051 --> 01:29:10.469
But I've done the right
thing by surrendering

01:29:10.554 --> 01:29:12.304
and I hope that
you do the same.

01:29:12.389 --> 01:29:14.139
I wasn't planning
on it.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:20.688
Now, look, I know my son and
the others have done you wrong.

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:24.316
And I know you
want my boy dead.

01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:27.319
But that ain't gonna
bring your dog back,

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:29.989
no more than I could
regrow my leg.

01:29:30.073 --> 01:29:34.577
So let's stop the killing
and let's be reasonable.

01:29:36.079 --> 01:29:37.788
Reasonable?

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:41.166
That how you run this town?

01:29:41.459 --> 01:29:43.168
Well, now, you don't know
nothing about that.

01:29:43.253 --> 01:29:45.421
This town needs me.

01:29:45.505 --> 01:29:47.298
This town wouldn't be
standing here without me.

01:29:48.174 --> 01:29:49.842
These people need a leader.

01:29:50.844 --> 01:29:52.928
Now, they don't
always like it,

01:29:53.013 --> 01:29:54.805
but they can't
survive without it.

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:56.640
Now, you ought to
remember that, soldier.

01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:58.100
Now, come on.

01:29:58.184 --> 01:30:00.436
Leaders are chosen,
Marshal.

01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:02.563
You ain't given
nobody a choice.

01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:04.732
Your son?

01:30:07.527 --> 01:30:09.153
He killed my dog.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:12.865
So now, I ain't got no choice.

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:15.868
All right, enough talking, Dad!
Now, hey!

01:30:15.952 --> 01:30:18.913
No! I said I got it
and you get out of the way!

01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:20.372
No.
Stand back, Gilly!

01:30:20.457 --> 01:30:22.875
Now, both of you all
put your guns down.

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:24.627
Now,
that's enough is enough!

01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:28.255
You're just saying that
because he's got you beat.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:32.217
He thinks he won, but he ain't
won shit, not while I'm still here.

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:34.887
Gilly! Put your guns down!

01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:36.138
No, he'll shoot me!

01:30:36.222 --> 01:30:37.264
He won't shoot you!

01:30:37.349 --> 01:30:38.933
Now look,
we can stop all of this.

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.769
No, he killed Roy,
and then he killed Harris.

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:44.146
He killed Tubby, and I'm not
gonna let him get away with it.

01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:45.940
He's got to die
for what he did!

01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:47.232
He does not have to die.

01:30:47.525 --> 01:30:48.776
Nobody's got to die.

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:51.445
Now, look, I'm begging you,
don't shoot my son.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:55.491
The time for begging is over.

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:57.534
Now's the time for praying.

01:30:58.536 --> 01:31:02.790
Well, don't worry, Dad,
everything is under control.

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:04.875
You just step away.

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:08.879
Just can I...
Just let me talk to him.

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:10.923
Just let me talk to him.

01:31:12.092 --> 01:31:14.176
No. We're done talking.

01:31:44.582 --> 01:31:45.708
Dad.

01:31:50.213 --> 01:31:51.338
Dad.

01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:40.345
You all saw what he did!

01:32:41.848 --> 01:32:43.140
He did this!

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:45.809
He killed him!

01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:51.523
This is all his fault!

01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:58.405
And anyone who helps that man
is as good as dead!

01:32:59.866 --> 01:33:02.034
Now, where the fuck are you?

01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:04.161
Where the fuck are you?

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:25.307
Lady?

01:33:31.106 --> 01:33:33.565
What are you doing here?

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:36.944
What are you doing here?

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:39.905
Shit.

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:54.795
What do you say we
get out of here?

01:34:00.009 --> 01:34:01.343
Give me a second.

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:08.183
Move!

01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:18.610
Where are you?

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:24.199
I know you're in here.

01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:39.965
Now,

01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:44.011
you show your face,
you coward.

01:34:59.235 --> 01:35:01.570
Why did you kill my dog?

01:35:01.654 --> 01:35:03.822
Why would you do that?

01:35:07.994 --> 01:35:10.287
Why would you
hurt my dog?

01:35:13.917 --> 01:35:15.334
No! No!

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:22.507
Stop, please!
Please, not again.

01:35:22.592 --> 01:35:25.260
Please, stop! Please, stop!

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:35.145
I don't want to die!

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:37.064
Please, get off of me.

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:38.875
Come on. Come on.

01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:07.904
I told you
I could help you.

01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:05.629
Hey, now.

01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:16.807
Gilly? Gilly?
Where are you?

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.487
Gilly?

01:38:31.781 --> 01:38:33.740
Through this holy anointing
may the Lord

01:38:33.825 --> 01:38:35.325
in his love and
his mercy help you

01:38:35.451 --> 01:38:36.827
with the grace of
the Holy Spirit.

01:38:37.328 --> 01:38:40.622
May the Lord who sets us
free...

01:38:42.625 --> 01:38:45.419
You ought to stick around
a while this time, Father.

01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:47.587
We could all use
a little saving.

01:38:57.932 --> 01:38:59.349
It's okay,
I got you.

01:38:59.475 --> 01:39:00.934
Let's just get inside.
