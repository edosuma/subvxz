'If I get promoted to loan
supervisor, that's an extra 160 a month.

00:31.107 --> 00:33.416
'Four months, weekend in Zurich.

00:33.467 --> 00:38.336
'Lf I get it. I should've ironed my...
Why didn't I iron my fucking tie? '

00:38.387 --> 00:42.505
- Mark, I thought you'd be out by now.
- Nope, not out yet.

00:42.547 --> 00:44.299
Haven't been in yet.

00:44.347 --> 00:49.580
- 'Lovely soft face. '
- It's just Barbara and Lucy. Relax.

00:49.627 --> 00:53.905
You're right. Totally right.
I'll laugh. Have a nice laugh.

00:54.987 --> 00:58.297
Will Jeff's charity squash stuff
count for much?

00:58.347 --> 01:01.225
Mark, it'll be fine. I'm sure you'll get it.

01:03.027 --> 01:05.063
'Ohh... '

01:05.107 --> 01:08.304
Sophie, have you ever been to Zurich?

01:08.347 --> 01:10.417
- What?
- 'Too much. Too much! '

01:10.467 --> 01:13.459
Very clean, apparently. Ruthlessly clean.

01:13.507 --> 01:17.022
Talking of which, badminton.
Still on for Wednesday?

01:17.067 --> 01:19.740
- Yep.
- I was thinking, afterwards...

01:19.787 --> 01:22.665
Hi, Sophie. Hey, fuckface, you're on.

01:24.107 --> 01:29.625
'Forget it, mate, you're dead in the water.
I'm gonna be relaxing all over you. '

01:31.107 --> 01:33.177
Welcome to my world.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.582
Man, I am so glad you got me in here.

01:35.627 --> 01:37.743
Nice.

01:37.787 --> 01:42.577
Wicked. So let's go down to the studio
and start riffing on some shit.

01:42.627 --> 01:48.543
Totally, yeah. Although obviously one of
us must be on reception at any one time.

01:48.587 --> 01:53.263
- That's important.
- OK, I get it. The code, right?

01:53.307 --> 01:58.620
We bide our time and pick our moment
to really shake shit up and get noticed.

01:58.667 --> 02:01.739
Yeah. Although
the best way to get noticed

02:01.787 --> 02:06.178
is to pick up a four-pinter on the way in,
ask Ron if he wants a latte...

02:06.227 --> 02:09.537
Jesus, what happened?
You've got a Blair Witch ear!

02:09.586 --> 02:14.138
Oh. Yeah, that's Toni's.
You know, next-door Toni?

02:14.187 --> 02:19.500
Oh, the one you wrote, er -
- Toni's Theme for?

02:19.547 --> 02:21.538
She's like some kind of drug.

02:21.587 --> 02:25.182
Kind of like ketamine but...
with nicer hair.

02:25.227 --> 02:30.984
So, you're all set, ain't you? You are
a music studio reception runner now.

02:31.907 --> 02:34.421
- Gets the women hot.
- Yeah?

02:34.467 --> 02:39.860
Oh, yeah. It's a savage garden, my friend.
A savage garden.

02:39.907 --> 02:42.262
'Shall I ask what he means? '

02:43.307 --> 02:46.026
'The interview went really well.

02:46.067 --> 02:50.538
'Glad I didn't mention the phones.
Keep the big idea on ice for now.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.624
'Maybe should've mentioned
the blind kids.

02:53.667 --> 02:58.024
'Although it could've sounded like
I just did it for my CV.'

02:58.067 --> 03:00.262
- Mark?
- Hey, Sophie.

03:00.307 --> 03:02.867
Barbara said to tell you there's news.

03:02.907 --> 03:06.217
- What... They didn't give it to Jeff?
- No, they didn't.

03:06.267 --> 03:07.746
Yes!

03:09.107 --> 03:11.905
No. Mark, let me... Sit down.

03:11.947 --> 03:16.782
Erm, they didn't give it to Jeff
but they didn't give it to you either.

03:16.827 --> 03:19.341
Is this...? Is this a funny joke?

03:19.387 --> 03:23.539
No. Mark, listen,
this is weird, really weird.

03:23.587 --> 03:28.103
But Barbara asked me to temporarily
take over the supervisor role.

03:28.147 --> 03:32.345
Well, good.
That's good. Great.

03:32.387 --> 03:35.504
- Well, I'll get on with these.
- Oh, let me...

03:35.547 --> 03:38.107
It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter.

03:38.147 --> 03:40.945
So what - congratulations -
what happened?

03:40.987 --> 03:44.821
Barbara thought no one
came up to the required standard

03:44.867 --> 03:49.383
- and decided as an interim...
- Sure, sure, but what's the real deal?

03:50.267 --> 03:53.942
- Does there need to be a...?
- No! I mean, you know how...

03:53.987 --> 03:58.981
how I think of you, but you've got to say
I'm the better loan manager, right?

03:59.027 --> 04:01.336
- Well...
- You've got to say that.

04:01.387 --> 04:03.901
You're very good at your job, Mark.

04:03.947 --> 04:06.620
- Thanks, boss.
- That's all right.

04:06.667 --> 04:09.625
- Can you finish the Hertfordshire file?
- Yeah.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.340
- By tonight?
- You're serious?

04:12.387 --> 04:15.823
- It's not a big...
- No, totally, that's fine, fine.

04:15.867 --> 04:18.255
Yeah, I'll do that. Fine.

04:18.307 --> 04:21.982
'Just dance a death clog dance
over my hopes and dreams

04:22.027 --> 04:24.666
'and leave a girl turd in my happy place.

04:24.707 --> 04:27.824
'Shit, I should have
milked those blindies dry! '

04:27.867 --> 04:32.577
Yeah, so this is really very similar to
a much larger version

04:32.627 --> 04:36.302
of the old graphics equaliser
that you have on your hi-fi

04:36.347 --> 04:40.579
in that it takes the graphics,
which is another word for music

04:40.627 --> 04:42.583
and equalises them...

04:42.627 --> 04:48.065
'I've lost her. She's gone. I'm actually
quite boring when I put my mind to it. '

04:48.107 --> 04:52.305
- And the Chemical Brothers are in?
- Yeah, yeah. They're great.

04:52.347 --> 04:54.463
Really great group. Lovely guys.

04:54.507 --> 04:56.702
'Come on, this is it. '

04:56.747 --> 05:01.263
So, just sitting here you can almost
feel your mojo expanding.

05:01.307 --> 05:03.741
- Have you seen my book?
- No, I...

05:05.627 --> 05:07.777
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

05:08.507 --> 05:12.341
Is that Burroughs And The Drug Culture?
I love that book.

05:12.387 --> 05:15.060
Me too. I've been reading it for a year.

05:15.107 --> 05:18.941
I'm on the bit where Kerouac
finishes his Benzedrine high

05:18.987 --> 05:22.582
looks at his novel
and realises he wasn't holding a pen.

05:22.627 --> 05:26.176
Course, Ginsberg's in the corner,
ain't he, laughing.

05:26.227 --> 05:28.582
- But crying at the same time.
- Yeah.

05:28.627 --> 05:32.700
'Oh, great, they've clicked.
Brilliant, I hear clicking. '

05:32.747 --> 05:35.181
...it shits on Birdsong.
- So, Jez,

05:35.227 --> 05:38.902
could you have a look
at that thing for me on reception?

05:38.947 --> 05:42.656
The thing? Oh, that. I fixed that.

05:42.707 --> 05:45.904
Did you? Well, it's, er, gone again.

05:45.947 --> 05:48.507
No, I fixed it. Twice.

05:48.547 --> 05:52.062
I was just down there.
It's definitely not working.

05:52.107 --> 05:53.779
'Fuck off. '

05:53.827 --> 05:56.660
- What isn't?
- The thing you fixed.

05:56.707 --> 05:58.777
I'm just showing Toni around...

05:58.827 --> 06:02.945
Jeremy, I'm fine.
Your thing sounds... important.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.103
- Maybe...
- Hans.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.865
Super Hans.

06:07.587 --> 06:10.624
Super Hans could show me
the other equipment?

06:10.667 --> 06:13.818
'It's cool, there's a bond of trust.

06:13.867 --> 06:16.540
'He won't break the bond of trust. '

06:23.027 --> 06:25.382
- Ow!
- Sorry.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.146
'Yeah, sorry. You'll be sorry, bitch!

06:28.187 --> 06:30.985
'What a horrible... I couldn't hate her.

06:31.027 --> 06:35.543
'Why didn't I tell them the phones thing?
The phones thing rocks!

06:37.067 --> 06:39.945
'Sophie, climbing over
my dead body to...

06:39.987 --> 06:44.538
'It's not her fault. She doesn't
even realise, she's just a stooge.

06:44.587 --> 06:49.138
'A beautiful, stupid, ugly, shitting,
filthy, grasping stooge! '

06:49.187 --> 06:51.576
- Whoops!
- Ha.

06:51.627 --> 06:54.505
'Come on, Mark, don't let this ruin things.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.822
'Besides, once you're going steady

06:56.867 --> 07:01.179
'you can put her handbag in the fridge
and tell her she's going mad. '

07:01.227 --> 07:03.582
What's funny?

07:03.627 --> 07:06.221
Nothing, sorry. Good shot.

07:06.267 --> 07:10.465
'It's just a game. A grown-up game.
Mousetrap. Downfall.

07:10.507 --> 07:15.456
'Hunt The Yorkshire Ripper. It's not
her fault. Didn't mention the phones! '

07:16.987 --> 07:21.265
Phew! 15-9. Well played.
Shall we call it a day?

07:21.307 --> 07:24.936
- What?
- Sorry, I've been invited to dinner.

07:24.987 --> 07:28.263
- Aren't we going for dinner?
- You never said.

07:28.307 --> 07:31.299
- I thought we said.
- I don't think we said.

07:31.347 --> 07:35.181
- The whole team's going and...
- The whole team. The team.

07:35.227 --> 07:38.503
- Sorry, it's really rude, but I thought...
- Fine.

07:38.547 --> 07:41.664
'It's all fine. Everything is clear.

07:41.707 --> 07:44.221
'I love her. She is going to kill me. '

07:44.267 --> 07:46.656
It's all totally fine.

07:48.107 --> 07:52.976
'She's my guest, I invited her.
Why am I making Ron lattes all day? '

07:54.267 --> 07:58.624
Jez! Just, er, showing Toni
the drum loop from Bomb Dog.

07:58.667 --> 08:02.740
'She'll get bored of him,
just like she got bored of me. '

08:03.227 --> 08:06.663
OK, see you.
You sure you can get home from here?

08:06.707 --> 08:08.106
Uh-huh.

08:08.147 --> 08:11.344
'You can never go home again.
Winter's coming.

08:11.387 --> 08:15.062
'Is this Stalingrad?
Is this where it all ends?

08:15.107 --> 08:18.895
'Or is this... where it all starts?!

08:18.947 --> 08:22.383
'This is a good idea. This is a great idea!

08:22.427 --> 08:27.421
'It's exactly what they're looking for
and not expecting! Just do it! '

08:27.467 --> 08:31.096
- Alan, Mike, Barbara, mind if I butt in?
- Mark.

08:31.147 --> 08:34.981
I'm not going to tuck in,
courtesy of the expense account,

08:35.027 --> 08:38.178
I just wanted to share with you
my vision...

08:38.227 --> 08:40.422
- Mark!
- Can this wait?

08:40.467 --> 08:44.380
Can JLB's future wait till tomorrow?
I don't think so.

08:44.427 --> 08:46.895
And you'll agree when you hear the idea

08:46.947 --> 08:50.144
I was just too darn scared
to spill at interview.

08:50.187 --> 08:53.099
- I know you wanted...
- Reroute the phones.

08:54.107 --> 08:56.575
'This was definitely a good idea. '

08:56.627 --> 09:00.415
Simple as that, reroute the phones
to everyone's mobiles.

09:00.467 --> 09:05.222
24-hour, face-to-face, round-the-clock
customer-freaking-service.

09:05.267 --> 09:09.818
It's like, hey, I'm clocking off,
finger to the customer! Not any more!

09:09.867 --> 09:12.859
Probably best
if you go home now, old son.

09:12.907 --> 09:16.343
I've worked with blind kids!
I'm the full package!

09:16.387 --> 09:20.619
I'll have my action plan on your desk
first thing in the morning.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.135
'This was definitely a good idea.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.224
'There's no chance
this wasn't a good idea. '

09:29.387 --> 09:31.378
Call yourself a mate, mate?

09:31.427 --> 09:34.180
- What?
- Oh, yeah, right, "What?"

09:34.227 --> 09:35.945
I saw you leave her flat today.

09:35.987 --> 09:39.536
She wanted bongo lessons,
she has a passion for percussion.

09:39.587 --> 09:44.217
She hasn't got a bongo. You weren't
carrying a... There was no bongo.

09:44.267 --> 09:47.703
- You don't need a drum to...
- Look, I'm next door,

09:47.747 --> 09:50.341
I heard your... noise, last night.

09:50.387 --> 09:53.185
Oh, that. That was press-ups.

09:53.227 --> 09:56.902
Well, you certainly seemed
to enjoy the last few a lot.

09:56.947 --> 10:00.417
Mate, sometimes you've got
to push for the burn.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.140
'Uh-oh, it's the human time bomb. '

10:03.187 --> 10:07.419
- Hey, Jeremy.
- Hey, man. Good to see you.

10:07.467 --> 10:11.858
We're just hangin' out with the band.
Long day at the studio.

10:11.907 --> 10:13.898
So, how are you doing?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.984
- Good. I'm feeling pretty good.
- Great.

10:17.027 --> 10:22.499
The way I see it now, if Barbara thinks
Sophie's right for the job

10:22.547 --> 10:24.742
then Sophie's right for the job.

10:26.907 --> 10:30.980
'Barbara, thought we should
follow-up re: The phones thing.

10:31.027 --> 10:34.861
'Oh, you're not here.
Well, I'll leave my idea in your desk,

10:34.907 --> 10:39.822
'give you time to think about it.
My new idea is urine. Loads of urine.

10:39.867 --> 10:45.305
'What do you think about that? Don't you
think that will be just the ticket?

10:45.347 --> 10:48.464
'You're getting some too. '

10:48.507 --> 10:51.067
JLB Credit, fuck off, please.

10:51.827 --> 10:54.022
'What? From Sophie?

10:54.067 --> 10:58.060
'Application letter to...?
She did it. She stiffed me.

10:58.987 --> 11:02.343
'Well, Sophie's drawer's
getting a dousing too.

11:02.387 --> 11:04.662
'Or I could park a turd on her desk.

11:04.707 --> 11:08.336
'Bit freaky. Pissing's OK.
Pissing's just horseplay.

11:08.387 --> 11:13.780
'Oh, my God! Oh, no! I didn't do it!
It was a joke - she did it to me last week.

11:13.827 --> 11:15.226
'Shit! '

11:15.267 --> 11:18.543
- Mark?
- Sophie, I didn't realise you were here.

11:18.587 --> 11:21.306
Yeah, working late. What are you doing?

11:21.347 --> 11:24.180
Oh, just likewise. Er, working late.

11:24.227 --> 11:26.787
- Left a file here somewhere.
- Right.

11:27.867 --> 11:30.745
Mark, I'm glad
I bumped into you actually.

11:30.787 --> 11:35.303
About the other night at the restaurant,
I just wanted you to know...

11:35.347 --> 11:38.419
- 'Don't notice the piss. '
- Yeah, Mark?

11:38.467 --> 11:40.219
Yeah, totally.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.935
Oh, I knew she had these somewhere.

11:43.987 --> 11:47.696
- Let me get those for you.
- Oh. Thanks, Mark.

11:47.747 --> 11:50.022
Erm, listen, do you want to...?

11:50.067 --> 11:54.424
Better not, thanks.
Got a lot to do. Thanks.

11:55.667 --> 12:00.138
'Yeah, I've got to take the letter-shaped
knife out of my back. Judas!

12:06.107 --> 12:08.985
'OK, they're a bit crinkled. So what?

12:09.027 --> 12:12.224
"'Hello, police,
someone broke into my office

12:12.267 --> 12:14.827
"'and crinkled my papers. " I think not. '

12:17.427 --> 12:19.383
- Hello, Mark?
- Sophie?

12:19.427 --> 12:23.102
I'm coming in if you're decent.
I'm going for a coffee.

12:24.667 --> 12:27.101
- What happened?
- It's not piss.

12:29.667 --> 12:34.582
So, I offer a mixture of therapy with other
disciplines such as careers guidance.

12:34.627 --> 12:37.903
But mainly you're
a careers guidance counsellor?

12:39.227 --> 12:43.698
I want to make it clear, I'm here
for careers guidance, not therapy.

12:43.747 --> 12:46.341
Not therapy. OK.

12:46.387 --> 12:49.823
- What are you saying?
- I'm just interested in why...

12:49.867 --> 12:55.066
I don't want to talk about any difficult
feelings I may be experiencing,

12:55.107 --> 12:58.543
my mother, my father
or my so-called childhood.

12:58.587 --> 13:01.101
Fine, fine.

13:01.147 --> 13:05.937
Well, I like to kick things off
with a bit of word association. It's...

13:05.987 --> 13:08.501
- Therapy?
- Not really, no.

13:08.547 --> 13:13.621
I'll say a word and you tell me the very
first thing that pops into your mind.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.623
'He's trying to therapise me. '

13:15.667 --> 13:19.899
- Let's start with an obvious one - work.
- 'Snake pit. '

13:19.947 --> 13:21.983
Snake charmer.

13:22.027 --> 13:25.622
Just say the first thing
that comes to mind. Money.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.306
- 'Everything. '
- Not everything.

13:28.347 --> 13:29.985
- Children.
- 'Blind. '

13:30.027 --> 13:31.983
- Er, short.
- Father.

13:32.027 --> 13:33.824
- 'Fuehrer. '
- Football.

13:33.867 --> 13:35.858
- Mother.
- 'Sophie. '

13:35.907 --> 13:38.023
Fuck! No, not fuck.

13:38.067 --> 13:42.140
Mark, I really get the feeling
you're resisting something.

13:42.187 --> 13:46.419
Can I change those? What score
did I get? It wasn't good, was it?

13:46.467 --> 13:50.255
- You don't get a score.
- Right, sure you don't.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.696
Maybe we should try something else.

13:52.747 --> 13:55.056
Have you done a Rorschach test?

13:58.267 --> 14:00.064
What do you see?

14:00.107 --> 14:02.780
'A hairy twat. A hungry, devouring twat. '

14:03.787 --> 14:05.584
A kitten?

14:06.507 --> 14:10.056
After that hook
we need to hit something, yeah?

14:10.107 --> 14:13.463
'They don't know about
my massive musical brain.

14:13.507 --> 14:16.465
'To them, I'm just
a mild-mannered janitor. '

14:16.507 --> 14:20.580
- The chorus is working.
- 'The chorus is like the Frog Chorus!

14:20.627 --> 14:23.221
' Someone needs to tell them.

14:23.267 --> 14:26.543
'I'm an outsider but I'm on the inside.

14:26.587 --> 14:30.580
'This is my moment.
Go on, do it, cross the drawbridge.

14:30.627 --> 14:32.618
'Make the splash. '

14:32.667 --> 14:35.704
Maybe you should just
mess things up a bit.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.466
Sorry?

14:38.507 --> 14:43.058
I mean, don't you think it'd be better
if the sound was more kaz-zow?!

14:44.467 --> 14:46.458
Yeah. OK.

14:46.507 --> 14:49.021
Not so much A to B to C,

14:49.067 --> 14:52.184
but more sort of A to D

14:52.227 --> 14:54.866
and then back to A and then to X!

14:55.867 --> 14:58.904
You know, just better. Like your first CD.

14:58.947 --> 15:03.463
I mean, obviously I don't want to butt in.
I mean... It's your song.

15:07.027 --> 15:12.704
Cos like I say, at the moment
it is very duh-duh-duh-duh.

15:12.747 --> 15:16.865
Oh, God, we're doing the fucking song.

15:16.907 --> 15:18.977
When's it gonna finish?

15:19.027 --> 15:20.904
Fuckin' hell.

15:22.227 --> 15:27.017
Where as I'm thinkin' it should be more...

15:27.067 --> 15:30.742
Whereas, like I say,
at the moment it is more kind of...

15:33.427 --> 15:36.499
Which it doesn't have to be.

15:36.547 --> 15:38.856
Yeah. No.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.502
Yeah, that's great. Thanks, mate.

15:43.907 --> 15:45.943
No problem, mate.

15:45.987 --> 15:50.902
'This was definitely a good idea. There's
no chance this wasn't a good idea. '

15:50.947 --> 15:54.178
Yeah, anyone could see that.
No, I'll tell him.

15:54.227 --> 15:56.616
All right, Mr T. Cheers then.

15:58.147 --> 16:00.377
Sorry, mate, you're out.

16:00.427 --> 16:05.217
- Fired? But...
- Ron's tough. I did everything I could.

16:05.267 --> 16:08.179
- What? You didn't do shit.
- Earlier.

16:08.227 --> 16:12.618
Had it out with him earlier -
I threatened to walk, he wouldn't have it.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.703
So are you gonna walk now?

16:14.747 --> 16:17.341
Steady on, mate, I'm not Spartacus.

16:17.387 --> 16:21.380
That's pretty bloody obvious.
Well, I refuse.

16:22.907 --> 16:26.263
I'm not going.
So what are you gonna do about that?

16:28.547 --> 16:32.586
I'm still here, Super Hans.
Still standing here. You lose.

16:32.627 --> 16:35.460
- Ron? He won't go.
- I see through you.

16:35.507 --> 16:38.943
Trying to get me out
so you can muscle in on my woman.

16:38.987 --> 16:41.740
No, all right. OK. I'll put him on.

16:41.787 --> 16:43.778
...lay down and...

16:45.267 --> 16:51.103
OK. No, that won't be necessary because
I'll be leaving the premises immediately.

16:52.107 --> 16:53.745
Thank you, Ron.

16:58.227 --> 17:00.343
'That's your entire life. '

17:00.387 --> 17:03.663
You see, he's not Lennon,
but she is Yoko.

17:03.707 --> 17:06.983
I'm Lennon
but Yoko has gone off with Paul.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.861
I mean, imagine that.
That's the scenario we're talking.

17:11.906 --> 17:16.377
- Don't they mind you not going in?
- They think I'm ill.

17:16.426 --> 17:20.420
I'm screwing the system
and there's not a thing they can do.

17:22.267 --> 17:25.065
Sophie's gonna pay. She'll pay all right.

17:25.107 --> 17:30.056
Yeah, I mean, what's wrong with revenge
and plagues and pestilence and all that?

17:30.107 --> 17:33.099
- Exactly!
- Suddenly you can't wreak revenge?

17:33.147 --> 17:36.184
It's political correctness gone mad.

17:38.187 --> 17:41.941
Jeremy, have you seen
Strangers On A Train?

17:41.987 --> 17:45.059
Yeah, sure. No one suspects the chef.

17:45.107 --> 17:49.419
It's about these two guys
who take care of each other's enemies.

17:49.467 --> 17:53.858
OK, right. And what happens in the end?

17:53.907 --> 17:55.784
I can't remember.

17:55.827 --> 17:58.944
But I'm pretty sure
it all turns out all right.

17:58.987 --> 18:01.421
'Happy painting, God bless. '

18:05.387 --> 18:08.504
- This is the ultimate.
- Yes, sirree.

18:08.547 --> 18:10.458
It's payback time.

18:10.507 --> 18:15.137
- And she's paying back in fear dollars.
- So what are you gonna say?

18:15.187 --> 18:18.065
I'm gonna cut her up
and leave her in buckets.

18:18.107 --> 18:22.259
No, you... Don't say that!
Jesus, that's horrible.

18:22.307 --> 18:26.061
Just say... something like...

18:26.107 --> 18:29.338
Ask is Mrs Hugh Jass there.

18:29.387 --> 18:34.177
No, no, she's got a thing about her bum.
How about Mike Hunt? No, no.

18:34.227 --> 18:36.457
What shall I say then? Oh, hello?

18:36.507 --> 18:41.058
Er, it's, erm...
I'm watching you.

18:41.867 --> 18:45.985
Not in a horrible way, just I can see you.

18:46.027 --> 18:49.542
Yes, I can. You're eating spaghetti.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.179
Linguine. Whatever.

18:52.667 --> 18:55.022
Well, I'm outside.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.297
I'm behind a bush.

18:58.027 --> 19:02.543
No, I'm not gonna tell you.
Look, I'm in charge here, I'm the one...

19:02.587 --> 19:06.899
There's no need to go over the top,
I'm just shitting you up a bit.

19:06.947 --> 19:10.064
- Jeremy, she's got an air gun!
- Sophie, I...!

19:10.107 --> 19:13.224
- She's going to...
- Oh, God! Jesus!

19:13.267 --> 19:17.465
- Bollocks, that kills!
- She's coming, we've got to...

19:17.507 --> 19:21.500
'Why not come clean?
You can say... You could say...

19:21.547 --> 19:25.381
'No, there is no possible way
of making this look...!

19:25.427 --> 19:26.940
'Oh, fuck! '

19:33.027 --> 19:35.177
Lucky you had those boots.

19:35.227 --> 19:38.025
Yeah, I suppose everything
turned out all right.

19:38.067 --> 19:40.058
Yeah, she got the message.

19:40.107 --> 19:43.065
'I've made a psycho call
to the woman I love,

19:43.107 --> 19:48.261
'I've kicked a dog to death, and now I'm
going to pepper-spray an acquaintance.

19:48.307 --> 19:50.457
'I mean, what's happened to me? '

19:50.507 --> 19:54.500
- You still up for this?
- Yeah, it's fine. I'm on it.

19:54.547 --> 19:58.142
- Great. The plan again?
- I give Super Hans the pizza,

19:58.187 --> 20:01.862
pepper-spray him,
kick him in the nuts and grab his wallet

20:01.907 --> 20:05.024
- so it looks like a robbery.
- That's the spirit.

20:06.427 --> 20:08.099
Go for it, buddy.

20:08.147 --> 20:10.615
'What am I doing? I can't do this!

20:11.627 --> 20:13.618
'There's no way I can do this! '

20:15.187 --> 20:17.098
Do I look like I eat pizza?

20:18.747 --> 20:22.023
There's no pizza.
It's me, Mark.

20:22.067 --> 20:27.460
I'm here to pepper-spray Super Hans
and kick him in the nuts but I can't.

20:27.507 --> 20:31.466
I can't, all right?
It's all gone over the edge of reason.

20:31.507 --> 20:35.580
- Mark?
- It would really help if you could scream.

20:35.627 --> 20:38.346
- Screaming?
- Yeah, and tell Jeremy...

20:38.387 --> 20:42.141
Why haven't you pepper-sprayed him?

20:42.187 --> 20:44.257
Jez? Is this for real?

20:44.307 --> 20:46.582
Er, I am not Jeremy, I am...

20:46.627 --> 20:51.655
Oh, lookee lookee at this!
What a very big surprise!

20:51.707 --> 20:54.062
Another late-night bongo lesson?

20:54.107 --> 20:57.702
Jeremy, we're two single people
having a great time.

20:57.747 --> 21:00.705
If you can't handle that,
go back to the '50s.

21:00.747 --> 21:04.217
Yeah. Yeah, maybe you should
make a move, mate.

21:04.267 --> 21:07.623
OK, mate, I'll make a move.
How about this for a move?

21:07.667 --> 21:10.704
Oh! Oh, fuck me!

21:10.747 --> 21:13.466
That's enough! Jez, there's no need to...

21:13.507 --> 21:18.058
Fuck! Oh, you sprayed me!
You fucking sprayed me!

21:18.107 --> 21:20.496
It's for your own good.

21:24.507 --> 21:27.101
OK, enough careers guidance...

21:28.147 --> 21:30.058
I need therapy.

21:36.147 --> 21:38.945
How could it have been
for my own good?

21:38.987 --> 21:41.455
I don't want to talk about it any more.

21:41.507 --> 21:44.897
You didn't kick him in the nuts -
that's something.

21:44.947 --> 21:47.620
You can build on that. The spray's gone.

21:47.667 --> 21:49.897
Where is it?

21:49.947 --> 21:51.938
Just tell me where it is.

21:51.987 --> 21:56.697
Look, Mr Klugman has a little mantra
that I'm finding very helpful.

21:56.747 --> 22:00.376
Heal and grow. Not to be patronising

22:00.427 --> 22:03.897
but perhaps you want to have
a good think about that.

22:11.627 --> 22:14.346
- Sophie?
- 'Heal and grow. Heal and grow. '

22:14.387 --> 22:16.378
Good to see you. Come in.

22:17.347 --> 22:21.579
- Mark, are you OK?
- I've been feeling a little low lately but...

22:22.627 --> 22:26.620
- What happened with...?
- Oh, that. That's nothing.

22:26.667 --> 22:29.386
Jeremy just hit me, with the ladle.

22:29.427 --> 22:33.943
Jesus, Jeremy!
You can't just hit people with ladles!

22:33.987 --> 22:36.421
He shouldn't have pepper-sprayed me.

22:36.467 --> 22:40.460
What? What's going on, Mark?
You've been away for...

22:40.507 --> 22:43.499
Sophie, Sophie, relax. I'm fine.

22:43.547 --> 22:45.344
Life is fine.

22:45.387 --> 22:48.026
'Cool, wet grass. Cool, wet grass. '

22:48.067 --> 22:51.503
I'm having therapy.
I'm going to the solarium.

22:51.547 --> 22:54.937
I have spoken with
the Citizens Advice Bureau.

22:54.987 --> 22:57.706
There's nothing inside killing me.

22:57.747 --> 23:00.056
Yeah? Good.

23:00.107 --> 23:03.861
Because I... I wanted
to apologise about the work thing.

23:03.907 --> 23:07.980
- I know how much you wanted it.
- 'Lying bitch! Not bitch. '

23:08.027 --> 23:10.541
It's fine, fine, fine.

23:10.587 --> 23:13.147
I've let go of all that stuff.

23:13.187 --> 23:14.984
- Yeah?
- Totally.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.018
Oh, that's great, really.

23:17.067 --> 23:20.025
And you're well out of it, it's all politics.

23:20.067 --> 23:22.661
The joke is, I don't really want the job

23:22.707 --> 23:26.336
but Barbara made me
write an application letter.

23:26.387 --> 23:28.696
Ahh. Right.

23:28.747 --> 23:33.901
'Jesus, so she didn't... I'm such
a cockmuncher. No, not cockmuncher. '

23:33.947 --> 23:37.098
So I just wanted to say
I enjoyed badminton

23:37.147 --> 23:41.425
and I hope when you're back on my team
we can get back to normal.

23:41.467 --> 23:44.265
- Your team.
- 'Heal and grow! Heal and grow! '

23:44.307 --> 23:48.266
Well, I guess it's very nice
for the big lady to come down here

23:48.307 --> 23:50.616
and talk to the little man.

23:50.667 --> 23:55.297
I'm just surprised you can see me
from up there in your ivory tower.

23:55.347 --> 23:57.907
If you're gonna be like that then fuck off.

23:57.947 --> 24:00.256
Sophie! Sophie, don't go!

24:00.307 --> 24:02.298
Sophie, I...

24:02.347 --> 24:04.417
Hey, Mark, I found it.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.738
It's for your own good.
