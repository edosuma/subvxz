WEBVTT

00:01.603 --> 00:03.616
I'd come a long way from sophomore year,

00:03.641 --> 00:04.850
from being a random suicide girl

00:04.875 --> 00:07.240
to just a random girl again.

00:07.265 --> 00:10.145
Already I was feeling the core
emotional drama of senior year,

00:10.147 --> 00:13.015
the sadness of doing something
for the last time ever.

00:13.017 --> 00:15.417
We've been through so much together,

00:15.419 --> 00:17.920
and we should graduate together.

00:17.922 --> 00:19.989
I was thinking about
maybe taking a gap year.

00:19.991 --> 00:21.256
All I want to do is love you,

00:21.281 --> 00:23.520
and you fight me every step of the way.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.178
I was class president, Jake.

00:25.203 --> 00:27.437
What if I'm never president
of anything else ever?

00:27.439 --> 00:29.305
You have a whole new life ahead of you.

00:29.307 --> 00:31.041
It was so much less complicated

00:31.043 --> 00:32.342
when I didn't know I
was in love with you.

00:32.344 --> 00:33.877
Right back at you.

00:33.879 --> 00:35.779
Matty and I still had
a lot to figure out.

00:35.781 --> 00:37.203
We'd jumped through too many hoops

00:37.228 --> 00:39.259
to let a little thing like
distance come between us,

00:39.284 --> 00:42.118
because deep down, we knew
that love would conquer all.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.453
Of course, that's not
quite what happened.

00:58.859 --> 00:59.859
What are you doing here?

00:59.861 --> 01:01.094
You missed the final.

01:01.096 --> 01:02.996
What? I didn't miss the final.

01:02.999 --> 01:05.946
I graduated. Here's my diploma.

01:08.523 --> 01:09.921
Thank God the nightmare of being trapped

01:09.946 --> 01:12.303
in high school forever
turned out to be just that...

01:12.305 --> 01:15.265
A nightmare.

01:15.290 --> 01:16.320
Hey.

01:17.248 --> 01:18.976
Yeah, of course I'll pick you up.

01:19.719 --> 01:21.252
Yep, meet you at the curb.

01:21.254 --> 01:23.820
Hey, you want to spend the night?

01:24.969 --> 01:27.135
Yay! Okay, can't wait.

01:27.137 --> 01:29.015
I love you too.

01:31.742 --> 01:34.243
My first year of college
had been fantastic.

01:34.245 --> 01:35.978
Even better than expected.

01:35.980 --> 01:38.413
I was becoming the person
I was always meant to be,

01:38.415 --> 01:39.881
and I was really liking that person.

01:39.883 --> 01:42.818
Oh, I just miss my little girl so much

01:42.820 --> 01:44.286
when I don't see her.

01:44.288 --> 01:47.055
Well, the wait is over, I'm back!

01:48.259 --> 01:49.000
Oh.

01:49.025 --> 01:52.471
Oh, it's okay. She's
just not used to you.

01:52.496 --> 01:54.763
Uh... Lissa, what are you doing here?

01:54.765 --> 01:56.231
I'm the nanny. Duh.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.966
I didn't know Jenna
was coming back today.

01:57.968 --> 01:59.868
Uh, not today. Last night.

01:59.870 --> 02:03.805
Very late, which I guess
is why no one waited up.

02:03.807 --> 02:06.441
I'm sorry, sweetie,
we've just been so crazed.

02:06.443 --> 02:07.914
And it was so late.

02:07.939 --> 02:09.738
So... what?

02:10.413 --> 02:12.492
So you forgot?

02:15.460 --> 02:18.859
Synced and corrected by Chitorafa
www.addic7ed.com

02:19.869 --> 02:21.812
I knew I'd undergone a
dramatic transformation

02:21.837 --> 02:23.452
during my year away at college,

02:23.477 --> 02:25.944
but was surprised that
everyone else had too.

02:25.945 --> 02:28.693
Suddenly I was a
stranger in my own home.

02:28.718 --> 02:31.631
Mom, did you get my hemp
milk? I'm non-dairy now.

02:31.656 --> 02:33.517
Really? You weren't joking?

02:33.750 --> 02:35.152
Ugh, sorry to be so rushed,

02:35.154 --> 02:36.764
but I have to register for
summer school... I couldn't

02:36.789 --> 02:38.670
carry a full course load last semester.

02:38.695 --> 02:40.625
Are you non-dairy now 'cause
it makes you break out?

02:40.650 --> 02:42.626
I think you've got a little blackhead.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.629
What? No, that's my nose piercing.

02:45.631 --> 02:46.897
Are you always here this early?

02:46.899 --> 02:48.842
Oh, no, usually I just stay the night.

02:48.867 --> 02:50.367
Uh, Liss, Morgan needs to go down soon,

02:50.369 --> 02:52.202
and, Kev, I'll be back for dinner.

02:52.204 --> 02:53.704
- Not sure I will.
- Okay.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.272
Oh, uh, let me know if you
want me to order something in.

02:55.297 --> 02:57.664
- Okay.
- Bye.

02:58.828 --> 03:00.377
I don't like to cook.

03:00.379 --> 03:03.280
So my triumphant return
hadn't been as triumphant

03:03.282 --> 03:04.882
as I had hoped.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.889
But the best part of
the day was yet to come.

03:06.914 --> 03:08.586
I could unload to the
one person who knew

03:08.588 --> 03:11.921
better than anyone how to cheer me up.

03:12.725 --> 03:14.367
Oh, God, Matty,

03:14.392 --> 03:17.560
the one person I hoped I'd
never have to see ever again.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.664
And after what happened,
I didn't think I would.

03:20.666 --> 03:23.233
- How are you?
- You look good, I'm good.

03:23.235 --> 03:25.469
...is for immediate
loading and unloading

03:25.471 --> 03:27.738
of passengers only.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.217
Oh, my God, T! You look amazing!

03:33.242 --> 03:35.543
Hey, Babe. It's so good to see you.

03:35.546 --> 03:38.046
Ugh, the flight from NYC was brute.

03:38.048 --> 03:40.515
I cannot fly coach anymore. So not chic.

03:40.517 --> 03:43.485
So I'm just waiting for one more bag.

03:43.510 --> 03:44.631
This ho-bag!

03:44.656 --> 03:47.223
Who are you calling a ho, you slore?

03:47.656 --> 03:50.260
Aww, is Jenna an Uber
driver for the summer?

03:50.261 --> 03:51.661
How traj.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.397
Careful when you're loading my bags.

03:53.398 --> 03:54.464
They're heavy.

03:54.466 --> 03:56.342
Uh, so not loading your bags.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.602
Don't give my attitude, Hamiltrench,

03:58.627 --> 04:00.193
I know what you did to Matty.

04:00.218 --> 04:03.163
Okay, I cannot stand not
knowing... WTF happened?

04:03.188 --> 04:05.588
- It's complicated.
- Sades, what's the big ish?

04:05.590 --> 04:07.679
Matty swore me to secrecy

04:07.704 --> 04:11.840
because it's disgusting and humiliating.

04:11.997 --> 04:15.065
Okay, then can we please
stop talking about it?

04:15.067 --> 04:17.701
My best friend had
befriended my worst enemy?

04:17.702 --> 04:19.402
How did that even happen?

04:19.404 --> 04:21.404
But I needed to stop
worrying about my old friends

04:21.406 --> 04:23.446
and look to my future.

04:24.710 --> 04:27.043
My new job at Idea Bin,
the website where I'd scored

04:27.045 --> 04:29.079
a competitive summer fellowship.

04:29.081 --> 04:31.314
Idea Bin blended journalism
and personal essays

04:31.316 --> 04:33.350
with listicles and
quizzes, and had quickly

04:33.352 --> 04:35.885
gotten both a lot of
traffic and a reputation

04:35.887 --> 04:38.021
as an incubator for hot young writers.

04:38.023 --> 04:40.256
Welcome, summer fellow.

04:40.258 --> 04:41.179
Which one are you?

04:41.204 --> 04:43.070
- Jenna Hamilton.
- Hi, I'm Ethan.

04:43.095 --> 04:44.561
I'm the Associate Editor here,

04:44.563 --> 04:46.329
and I supervise you fellowship peeps.

04:46.331 --> 04:48.064
Hi, Jenna? I'm Max.

04:48.066 --> 04:49.566
Max here, clearly a
glutton for punishment,

04:49.568 --> 04:52.131
is back for his second
summer as an unpaid fellow,

04:52.156 --> 04:53.287
as is Mia!

04:53.312 --> 04:53.914
Hi.

04:53.939 --> 04:56.139
Last summer, Mia got a piece
up her second week here.

04:56.141 --> 04:57.741
She'll probably get a book deal
by the time the summer's over.

04:57.743 --> 04:59.959
Bitch! JK.

04:59.984 --> 05:02.445
This is a safe, nurturing
space where we encourage

05:02.447 --> 05:03.780
both types of LOLing:

05:03.782 --> 05:06.983
laughing out loud and living out loud.

05:08.786 --> 05:11.788
Hey, I'm Ophelia, also a first-timer.

05:11.790 --> 05:13.428
This is intimidating, right?

05:13.453 --> 05:14.824
No, hon, don't be intimidated.

05:14.826 --> 05:16.156
Jenna, what's your Twitter handle?

05:16.181 --> 05:18.528
Oh, I haven't really
been tweeting that much.

05:18.530 --> 05:20.693
Is this you? IAmJennaHam?

05:20.718 --> 05:22.279
It's very Theodore Geisel. I like it.

05:22.304 --> 05:24.534
Dr. Seuss's real name! Genius, Jenna!

05:24.536 --> 05:26.703
Wait, 40 followers?

05:26.705 --> 05:29.115
IAmJennaHam last tweeted in October.

05:29.140 --> 05:31.482
I kind of backed off social
media when I was in Maine.

05:31.507 --> 05:33.998
"My boo is coming to visit?" My boo?

05:34.023 --> 05:38.093
Jenna, go to jail. That
was retired in 2005.

05:38.109 --> 05:41.010
Oaf here has 11,000 Twitter followers.

05:41.012 --> 05:43.479
I totally respect your
social media boycott.

05:43.481 --> 05:46.282
I wish I could wean myself,
but I just suck at weaning.

05:46.284 --> 05:49.719
I was breastfed till I was
six. Before it was chic.

05:49.721 --> 05:52.188
Chickens, to be a
writer you need a brand.

05:52.190 --> 05:54.457
And we establish and
cultivate that brand how?

05:54.459 --> 05:56.626
On social media, that is how
the clickbait gets clicked.

05:56.628 --> 05:58.576
That is how your sickness
is gonna go viral.

05:58.601 --> 05:59.562
I'm happy to help you.

05:59.587 --> 06:01.953
I spend way too much time
frittering with my twittering.

06:01.978 --> 06:04.545
- Thanks.
- Don't worry, hon.

06:04.563 --> 06:05.696
You'll catch up.

06:13.250 --> 06:16.803
Palos Hills Country Club
is a fun work environment,

06:16.828 --> 06:20.130
but we do demand a commitment
to the highest level

06:20.132 --> 06:22.734
of service and professionalism.

06:22.759 --> 06:24.259
Oh, of course, Jakey.

06:24.273 --> 06:27.107
You are, like, so serious now.

06:27.109 --> 06:28.608
- This is my job.
- Yeah, dude.

06:28.610 --> 06:29.929
I got your back.

06:30.462 --> 06:32.295
This is gonna be a blast.

06:32.414 --> 06:34.815
I wasn't too excited about
coming back home for the summer,

06:34.817 --> 06:38.326
but now, you know, I am.

06:38.351 --> 06:40.585
So are you gonna tell me
what went down with Jenna?

06:41.023 --> 06:42.723
Jenna...

06:42.725 --> 06:43.945
Jenna who?

06:44.760 --> 06:48.895
Okay, I have everyone's
assignment except...

06:48.897 --> 06:50.397
Jenna's.

06:50.399 --> 06:51.598
Here it is.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.718
Paper?

06:52.743 --> 06:54.712
What, did you write it
with a quill by candlelight?

06:54.737 --> 06:56.470
Why don't you just fax it to
me while you're at it, huh?

06:56.472 --> 06:58.654
Maybe the fax will make a comeback.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.607
- Yeah, and pagers.
- Tiddlywinks.

07:00.609 --> 07:02.553
I can see your first byline now, Jenna.

07:02.578 --> 07:06.313
"Making Backwards
Forwards." It's so... Etsy.

07:06.315 --> 07:08.545
Just to be clear, hon, that is a joke.

07:08.570 --> 07:10.317
Don't... don't actually do that.

07:10.319 --> 07:11.852
How had I already managed to become

07:11.854 --> 07:13.387
the office laughing stock.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.722
No, I wasn't gonna get down on myself.

07:15.724 --> 07:17.958
I wasn't gonna let anything
shake my confidence.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.926
Hey, what'd I miss?

07:19.928 --> 07:21.007
[bleep].

07:21.032 --> 07:24.030
Guys, this is Luke, also
a second-year fellow.

07:24.032 --> 07:25.866
Jenna. Good to see you.

07:25.868 --> 07:27.382
Luke, the perfect guy,

07:27.407 --> 07:28.578
the one who got away,

07:28.603 --> 07:30.647
the one who reminded me
of what an immature mess

07:30.672 --> 07:32.046
I'd been in high school.

07:32.071 --> 07:34.941
Yup, cool, confident Jenna
had just left the building.

07:36.947 --> 07:38.282
Oh... incoming!

07:38.822 --> 07:40.989
Lizzy Raines, the
Editor-in-Chief of Idea Bin,

07:40.990 --> 07:42.390
was one of my idols.

07:42.392 --> 07:43.991
Her work was smart and incisive,

07:43.993 --> 07:45.693
yet emotional and textured.

07:45.718 --> 07:46.391
Hi.

07:46.416 --> 07:48.473
I am way too angry to be mad right now.

07:48.498 --> 07:50.932
Treacherous publisher
thinks that "Perishables"

07:50.934 --> 07:52.233
is a bad title for a novel.

07:52.235 --> 07:55.524
Lizzy, the new fellows are all here.

07:56.372 --> 07:59.307
Hello. Welcome.

07:59.309 --> 08:00.875
I'd like you all to think of Idea Bin

08:00.877 --> 08:03.811
as a creative space, where
you can develop your craft

08:03.813 --> 08:04.979
and find your voices.

08:04.981 --> 08:06.547
I'm always available to you,

08:06.549 --> 08:08.516
except when I'm in my
office with the door closed,

08:08.518 --> 08:10.157
which is where I'm headed now.

08:11.988 --> 08:14.722
Once you get to know her,
she's a total pushover.

08:14.724 --> 08:17.291
So crazy that we're both working here.

08:17.293 --> 08:18.492
Not that crazy.

08:18.494 --> 08:19.813
Remember, we both discovered Idea Bin

08:19.838 --> 08:23.095
when we saw that Shira Munroe
piece on shy exhibitionists?

08:24.100 --> 08:25.391
You look great.

08:26.169 --> 08:27.563
How have you been?

08:27.971 --> 08:29.024
Great.

08:30.373 --> 08:32.506
Spill... how was your first day at work.

08:32.508 --> 08:34.708
Unbelievable... I actually ran into...

08:34.711 --> 08:36.844
OMG!

08:36.846 --> 08:38.879
I thought I left this
at some after-hours party

08:38.881 --> 08:40.078
in the West Village.

08:40.104 --> 08:43.294
I have to tell Sadie; she
will freak that I found this.

08:43.318 --> 08:45.186
I thought I was out two hundy!

08:45.188 --> 08:47.688
Wow, you spend a lot
of money on clothes.

08:47.690 --> 08:50.424
- You: Maine.
- Me: New York.

08:50.426 --> 08:52.360
Dress for success, or wail and fail.

08:52.362 --> 08:54.528
I guess, but the thing
about being in a small town

08:54.530 --> 08:56.964
is that you get less
attached to, you know, things,

08:56.966 --> 08:59.148
and more into, just, being.

08:59.173 --> 09:01.635
Well, I'm glad you've been
peace-ing out in the woods,

09:01.637 --> 09:04.572
if that's all you've been
doing since you went dark.

09:04.574 --> 09:05.477
What?

09:05.502 --> 09:07.986
Your social media blackout
did not go unnoticed, Jenna.

09:08.011 --> 09:10.845
It was aggressive, like
you hung up on the world.

09:10.847 --> 09:13.147
I had to, after what
happened with Matty, I just...

09:13.149 --> 09:15.950
Okay, so what did happen with Matty?

09:15.952 --> 09:19.165
I am dying to know.
Everyone is dying to know.

09:19.821 --> 09:22.556
- It's hard to explain.
- That is a cop-out.

09:22.558 --> 09:24.291
If you asked me about
my breakup with Adam,

09:24.293 --> 09:26.688
I would tell you
anything you want to know.

09:27.030 --> 09:28.295
Was it friendly?

09:28.297 --> 09:29.864
It was hard.

09:29.866 --> 09:32.382
TBH, if you hadn't gone
all M.I.A. "Paper Planes"

09:32.407 --> 09:34.268
on social media, you
would already know that.

09:34.270 --> 09:35.470
You feel me?

09:36.239 --> 09:38.305
Yeah, I feel you.

09:43.646 --> 09:46.247
Hey, Sadita, college girl back in town.

09:46.249 --> 09:48.082
Good to see you. Next?

09:48.084 --> 09:50.217
So how are you?

09:50.219 --> 09:51.685
Super busy right now,

09:51.687 --> 09:53.788
but let's catch up soon, okay?

09:53.790 --> 09:55.462
Soon sounds good.

09:55.487 --> 09:56.595
Lates.

09:58.728 --> 10:02.163
Sadie says Sergio's food
truck is out of control.

10:02.165 --> 10:04.432
Jump on it, bay-bay!

10:04.434 --> 10:06.567
"Oh, he is dying to jump
on me, but he's too busy

10:06.569 --> 10:08.769
"with his stupid food truck right now.

10:08.771 --> 10:11.672
Courtney Roy is throwing
a party in the Palisades."

10:11.674 --> 10:13.474
Shut up!

10:13.476 --> 10:14.720
Who's Courtney Roy?

10:14.745 --> 10:18.289
Oh, some boring trustafarian
Sadie and I met in New York.

10:18.314 --> 10:20.848
I hear her house is
sick, so I should go.

10:20.850 --> 10:22.016
Can we rain check?

10:22.018 --> 10:23.584
So... no sleepover?

10:23.586 --> 10:27.254
I know, I suck, but this
party is going to be mayj.

10:27.256 --> 10:29.757
But, you're more than welcome to come

10:29.759 --> 10:30.970
if you want.

10:31.149 --> 10:33.734
Why was it when people said
I was "more than welcome,"

10:33.759 --> 10:35.362
I always felt less than?

10:35.364 --> 10:37.998
Gee, T, you make it sound so appealing,

10:38.000 --> 10:39.667
but I think I'll pass.

10:39.669 --> 10:41.802
I may not have been cool
enough for Tamara anymore,

10:41.804 --> 10:43.804
but at least I could
go home to my parents.

10:43.806 --> 10:46.140
Shockingly, I actually
wanted to hang out with them.

10:46.142 --> 10:47.975
I'd missed them a lot
more than I expected.

10:47.977 --> 10:51.491
Oh, hey, Jenna, we didn't
know you'd be home for dinner.

10:51.516 --> 10:53.070
Change of plans.

10:53.095 --> 10:55.449
Well, we're going out for a date night,

10:55.451 --> 10:58.859
but, um... you're more
than welcome to join.

10:58.884 --> 10:59.626
Yeah.

10:59.651 --> 11:01.624
The dreaded "more than welcome" again.

11:01.649 --> 11:03.124
That's okay, you guys should go.

11:03.126 --> 11:05.790
- Okay, bye.
- Bye-bye.

11:06.368 --> 11:09.964
You don't have to stay. I
am happy to take care of her.

11:09.966 --> 11:12.032
All right.

11:12.034 --> 11:13.259
Oh.

11:14.303 --> 11:16.537
- Maybe you should stay.
- Oh.

11:16.539 --> 11:18.472
Hmm, must've been you, Jenna.

11:18.474 --> 11:19.940
Weird.

11:19.942 --> 11:21.342
Even my baby sister didn't want to have

11:21.344 --> 11:22.877
anything to do with me.

11:22.879 --> 11:24.345
Well, she wasn't the only crabby baby

11:24.347 --> 11:25.579
who felt like crying.

11:25.581 --> 11:26.712
It was time to go to bed

11:26.737 --> 11:28.926
and put this day out of its misery

11:28.951 --> 11:31.352
so I could start all
over again the next day

11:31.354 --> 11:33.487
with a clear head and a good attitude.

11:33.489 --> 11:35.374
- Good morning.
- Hey.

11:35.399 --> 11:36.593
Guess we're gonna have to get used to

11:36.618 --> 11:37.851
seeing each other every day.

11:37.876 --> 11:40.127
Yeah, still can't get
over the coincidence.

11:40.129 --> 11:42.429
Okay, to be perfectly honest,

11:42.431 --> 11:44.131
maybe not all that coincidental.

11:44.133 --> 11:46.167
I might have seen your
application on the pile

11:46.169 --> 11:49.305
and given it an extra push.

11:50.173 --> 11:50.938
Oh.

11:50.940 --> 11:53.307
So it wasn't a fluke; it was Luke?

11:53.309 --> 11:54.642
I thought I had gotten this internship

11:54.644 --> 11:56.510
on my own merit, but it was just

11:56.512 --> 11:59.532
the helping hand of
someone from my past.

12:00.449 --> 12:01.866
And it seemed like the more I wanted

12:01.891 --> 12:03.050
to put my past behind me,

12:03.052 --> 12:04.885
the more it wanted to
get all up in my face.

12:04.887 --> 12:07.888
I just got an invite to a
little high school gathering.

12:07.890 --> 12:09.156
Same old Palos Hills.

12:09.158 --> 12:10.827
Still a little Matty drama, huh?

12:10.852 --> 12:13.984
Oh, no, I'm not that girl anymore.

12:14.009 --> 12:17.064
College has given me a
whole new perspective.

12:17.066 --> 12:18.212
Good.

12:19.135 --> 12:20.907
Looks like we're starting up.

12:22.338 --> 12:23.871
I ask our new fellows to write about

12:23.873 --> 12:25.806
their worst experience
ever because I am a fan

12:25.808 --> 12:27.608
of ritual humiliation.

12:27.610 --> 12:28.776
JK!

12:28.778 --> 12:31.343
I ask because it is hard
to be both confessional

12:31.368 --> 12:32.680
and engaging.

12:32.682 --> 12:35.132
So, Jenna, tell me,

12:35.157 --> 12:36.757
why do you think your
essay is interesting?

12:36.782 --> 12:39.882
Well, it's about how
profoundly we can be affected

12:39.907 --> 12:42.375
by others' misperceptions of us.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.500
I broke my arm in a freak accident,

12:44.502 --> 12:47.169
but the story... the
accepted truth... was that

12:47.171 --> 12:48.471
I tried to kill myself.

12:48.473 --> 12:49.972
Right, but if you didn't actually

12:49.974 --> 12:52.808
try to kill yourself,
then what are the stakes?

12:52.810 --> 12:54.009
I just...

12:54.011 --> 12:55.711
Let me put it into
context for you, okay?

12:55.713 --> 12:59.849
Ophelia wrote about how
she did commit suicide.

12:59.851 --> 13:02.451
I was dead for two minutes
before they revived me.

13:02.453 --> 13:05.851
So you see? Ophelia was dead.

13:05.876 --> 13:06.930
That's interesting.

13:06.955 --> 13:09.191
I don't want to die again,
though, I'll tell you that much.

13:09.516 --> 13:11.868
You know, heaven seemed
really middle-of-the-road.

13:15.666 --> 13:17.032
Are you sure you don't want to come?

13:17.034 --> 13:17.735
More than.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.146
Hamilslag, there's a
30-foot no-slunt zone

13:20.171 --> 13:21.504
around Matty, 'Kay?

13:21.506 --> 13:23.205
Sadie, really, didn't you grow up at all

13:23.207 --> 13:24.673
your entire year of college?

13:24.675 --> 13:26.642
You guys, I'm really
trying to swing this

13:26.644 --> 13:28.577
and be bi-friendsual,
but your girl-fighting

13:28.579 --> 13:29.945
is making it muy hard.

13:29.947 --> 13:32.114
Go have fun with the
high school crowd, TK.

13:32.116 --> 13:34.416
I'm in the mood for some good Mexican,

13:34.418 --> 13:35.885
and you can't get that in the city.

13:35.887 --> 13:37.353
Get on it, you slut.

13:37.355 --> 13:38.621
Muah. Muah.

13:41.292 --> 13:43.225
- You see Matty?
- No.

13:43.227 --> 13:44.994
Are you really okay? Can you deal?

13:44.996 --> 13:47.930
Of course. We're all adults now.

13:47.932 --> 13:51.267
God knows we've all had our
fill of Matty and Jenna drama.

13:51.269 --> 13:53.569
Yes, but, from another POV,

13:53.571 --> 13:55.899
it's the gift that keeps on giving.

13:56.774 --> 13:58.474
I thought this was just supposed to be

13:58.476 --> 13:59.742
Palos Hills peeps.

13:59.744 --> 14:02.044
Who's that sloppy rando?

14:02.046 --> 14:03.884
My girlfriend.

14:04.548 --> 14:07.977
Matty, I love your
friends. I really like them.

14:12.958 --> 14:14.893
I'd been back from
college less than a week,

14:14.895 --> 14:16.728
but all my illusions about being a new,

14:16.730 --> 14:19.531
powerful, confident
person were crumbling.

14:19.533 --> 14:21.900
I can't believe that's
Matty's girlfriend.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.902
She does seem kind of gauche atrosh.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.871
And Matty seems like such a frat boy.

14:26.873 --> 14:29.207
Thank God boys aren't all
fratted-out in the city.

14:29.209 --> 14:31.609
Hey, babe, will you
make me a dirty martini?

14:31.611 --> 14:33.978
Babe, we got beer... in red cups.

14:33.980 --> 14:36.332
Welcome back to Palos Hills.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.857
Hey, Sadita, what are you doing here?

14:45.859 --> 14:48.020
Last night you said you
wanted to see me soon.

14:48.045 --> 14:50.672
Well, now's soon.

14:50.697 --> 14:52.630
Oh, man, I didn't say tonight, did I?

14:52.632 --> 14:54.643
Been so crazy busy I can't keep track.

14:54.668 --> 14:57.168
Yeah, and I can see what
you've been busy with.

14:57.170 --> 14:59.904
I bet that whore puts
in a lot of overtime!

14:59.906 --> 15:02.386
Sadie! That's my mom! Respect!

15:02.411 --> 15:04.142
Uh-huh, now I know why you don't want me

15:04.144 --> 15:06.010
to meet this Sadie girl.

15:06.012 --> 15:07.312
Maldita.

15:07.314 --> 15:09.781
I am so sorry, Mrs. Espinoza,

15:09.783 --> 15:12.150
Sergio told me how young
and beautiful you are,

15:12.152 --> 15:13.832
but I'm sorry...

15:14.487 --> 15:16.301
Okay, she can get over it.

15:16.326 --> 15:18.733
So where do you want to go?

15:18.758 --> 15:20.725
Sadie, I didn't know you were coming.

15:20.727 --> 15:21.645
I have plans.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.973
With your mama?

15:22.998 --> 15:26.411
No, with his girlfriend.

15:27.379 --> 15:28.786
Hi, I'm Julia.

15:30.637 --> 15:32.670
Oh, hi.

15:32.672 --> 15:34.439
We'll just have to do it another time.

15:34.441 --> 15:35.598
'Kay?

15:35.623 --> 15:36.723
Pal?

15:44.184 --> 15:45.934
I'm out!

15:45.959 --> 15:48.098
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:48.855 --> 15:50.609
What are you guys doing?

15:51.258 --> 15:52.624
Making out with tongue.

15:52.626 --> 15:54.893
So are you guys dating again?

15:54.895 --> 15:56.895
Yeah, for six months.

15:56.897 --> 15:58.161
Another thing you would have known

15:58.186 --> 16:00.041
if you were on social media.

16:00.066 --> 16:01.762
Yay, Sadie, you're here!

16:01.787 --> 16:03.293
Hey, cutie.

16:03.770 --> 16:06.337
So good to see you too. You look amaze.

16:06.339 --> 16:09.392
Let's chat lates, 'kay? I
need to tell T something.

16:10.466 --> 16:13.160
OMG, Sades, WTF? Tell me everything.

16:13.185 --> 16:14.401
I mean...

16:14.426 --> 16:16.537
Was it weird when you got home?

16:16.539 --> 16:18.238
No, it's been super fun.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.262
I have a baby, which is
perfect, since I've always wanted

16:20.270 --> 16:21.670
to be a Palos Hills mom.

16:21.672 --> 16:23.004
And your parents are
super cool and let Jake

16:23.006 --> 16:24.606
spend the night whenever I want.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.608
I mean, was he trying to humiliate me?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.643
Poor communication
skills are inexcusable.

16:28.645 --> 16:30.478
Me choir, keep preaching.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.913
Jake and I work well as a couple.

16:31.915 --> 16:33.848
Plus, between nannying and Atonercising,

16:33.873 --> 16:36.261
I don't even have time to
look for a different boyfriend.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.129
- That's romantic.
- I know.

16:38.723 --> 16:40.557
The thing is, don't ambush me!

16:40.582 --> 16:42.262
If you want to dip your little chip

16:42.270 --> 16:44.337
into some nasty guac while I'm away,

16:44.339 --> 16:46.472
that's fine, but just tell me.

16:46.475 --> 16:49.476
It's not always easy to
communicate long distance.

16:49.478 --> 16:51.504
Not for emotionally constipated slunts

16:51.529 --> 16:52.862
like you, maybe.

16:52.895 --> 16:54.932
Sades, Jenna is still my friend too.

16:54.957 --> 16:57.063
Thanks, T, but it's
actually reassuring to see

16:57.065 --> 16:59.637
that someone hasn't changed around here.

17:00.836 --> 17:03.470
Hey, dude, ball, please.

17:03.472 --> 17:05.405
This deep freeze is burning my ass.

17:05.406 --> 17:07.434
Can you at least be civ to each other?

17:08.143 --> 17:09.175
Fine.

17:10.212 --> 17:12.434
Here's your girlfriend's ball, Matty.

17:12.938 --> 17:14.146
Thank you, uh,

17:14.148 --> 17:15.781
can you take some of
the stink off of it?

17:15.784 --> 17:18.484
Oh, it came with that on it. Dude.

17:18.487 --> 17:19.752
Sully's just playing.

17:19.755 --> 17:21.688
Playing... is that what you call it?

17:21.690 --> 17:23.623
Yeah, I do. What do you call it?

17:23.625 --> 17:24.528
Rudeness.

17:24.553 --> 17:26.693
But, whatever, Matty, this is just so

17:26.694 --> 17:28.581
not what I expected out of you.

17:28.606 --> 17:30.864
Yeah, well, this pretentious
bull[bleep] you're putting on

17:30.866 --> 17:32.854
is exactly what I expected of you.

17:33.535 --> 17:34.804
Pretentious?

17:35.304 --> 17:37.837
Why, because I don't like
throwing balls at people's heads

17:37.839 --> 17:39.806
and playing stupid drinking games?

17:39.808 --> 17:41.474
Pretentious because
you've turned into some

17:41.476 --> 17:43.343
self-righteous hippie
chick thinking you're

17:43.345 --> 17:44.903
better than everyone
while standing there

17:44.928 --> 17:47.347
with some stupid thing
stuck in your nose.

17:50.351 --> 17:53.746
And this is why we can't
just be civ with each other.

17:56.896 --> 17:59.027
I was mad at myself
for being stupid enough

17:59.052 --> 18:01.183
to think Matty and I
could ever be okay again.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.410
But I was even madder at Matty
for all those hurtful things

18:03.435 --> 18:05.449
he said that made me want to scream...

18:14.880 --> 18:16.464
Just rock her a little.

18:16.489 --> 18:18.382
She needs to get used to her big sister.

18:18.384 --> 18:20.284
Yeah, she wasn't prepared...

18:20.286 --> 18:22.186
I know you've had a little
bit of a rough landing,

18:22.188 --> 18:23.454
and I'm really sorry.

18:23.456 --> 18:24.122
How would you know?

18:24.147 --> 18:26.481
It's not like you've
been paying attention.

18:27.434 --> 18:28.759
Well, am I right?

18:28.761 --> 18:31.028
Yes. Everyone's changed.

18:31.030 --> 18:32.196
Lissa has taken over our house,

18:32.198 --> 18:34.432
Tamara and Sadie are best friends,

18:34.434 --> 18:36.501
Luke got me my job without telling me,

18:36.503 --> 18:38.302
and Matty has turned
into a complete jerk.

18:38.304 --> 18:41.305
Okay, okay. Let's put
her back in her crib.

18:41.307 --> 18:44.108
When everyone stops trying
so hard to be adults,

18:44.110 --> 18:45.948
they'll stop acting like such children.

18:45.973 --> 18:48.456
Trust me, they're still the same people.

18:48.481 --> 18:49.891
But I've changed.

18:49.916 --> 18:54.519
Mm-hmm, you're more confident;
you're even smarter...

18:54.521 --> 18:56.721
but don't stop being
that sweet, sensitive girl

18:56.723 --> 18:58.356
I know and love, okay?

18:58.358 --> 19:02.727
Hey, I got you some
santizing wipes for your...

19:02.729 --> 19:04.028
Thanks, but...

19:04.030 --> 19:05.396
I think I'm actually
going to take it out.

19:05.398 --> 19:07.698
It's getting a little infected.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.116
I noticed.

19:11.059 --> 19:12.730
I'm sorry Morgan's in your room,

19:12.755 --> 19:16.031
and you don't have space
to do your writing...

19:16.643 --> 19:19.443
You know, I actually
do have some space...

19:19.445 --> 19:21.913
I was caught in a
perfect storm of emotions:

19:21.915 --> 19:24.415
angry, happy, defeated, hopeful.

19:24.417 --> 19:26.984
I knew I had to seize
the moment and work...

19:26.986 --> 19:28.619
So I went to Idea Bin.

19:37.997 --> 19:40.276
"I'm The Kind of Person Who
Found Her Voice In College."

19:40.301 --> 19:41.691
I thought this piece could say a lot

19:41.716 --> 19:42.900
about heartbreak and growth...

19:42.902 --> 19:45.339
sort of like a care-frontation
letter to myself.

19:45.364 --> 19:48.272
I'd post it and tweet it
everywhere and anywhere.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.364
Hey.

19:50.143 --> 19:51.509
What are you doing here so early?

19:51.511 --> 19:52.966
I've actually been here all night,

19:52.991 --> 19:54.989
trying to write something
Ethan won't hate.

19:55.014 --> 19:57.222
Listen, if he pushes you,
it's because he sees potential.

19:57.247 --> 20:00.618
Or he sees a girl whose
ex-boyfriend got her the job.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.667
Jenna, I wouldn't have pushed
your name on the top of the pile

20:02.692 --> 20:04.418
if I didn't think you
were really talented.

20:04.443 --> 20:06.209
Then, why didn't you
just tell me up front

20:06.211 --> 20:07.801
before I started here?

20:08.880 --> 20:09.879
I'm sorry, Jenna.

20:09.881 --> 20:12.782
It didn't even occur to me that
you might be insecure about it.

20:12.784 --> 20:14.581
Because I wasn't at all.

20:14.606 --> 20:16.252
I mean, you're gonna make me look good.

20:16.254 --> 20:18.432
Well, I'm no Ophelia.

20:19.291 --> 20:21.524
I didn't like her essay all that much.

20:21.526 --> 20:24.527
And, FYI, Ophelia got the internship

20:24.529 --> 20:26.763
because her dad's tight with Lizzy.

20:26.765 --> 20:28.409
- Really?
- Yes.

20:28.434 --> 20:30.605
And I got the job because
I was in Lizzy's class,

20:30.630 --> 20:32.003
and she likes me.

20:32.028 --> 20:34.537
There's not too much happens
that's completely blind.

20:34.539 --> 20:36.639
Knowing someone helps.

20:36.879 --> 20:38.112
I feel so naive.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.809
Well, I don't want to disillusion you...

20:40.192 --> 20:41.344
You can't.

20:41.346 --> 20:44.113
You are not the same
girl you were last year.

20:44.115 --> 20:45.849
Sorry to disappoint you.

20:45.851 --> 20:47.337
I'm not disappointed.

20:48.286 --> 20:51.178
You keep getting better and better...

20:57.209 --> 20:59.209
