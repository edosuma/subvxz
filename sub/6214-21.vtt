WEBVTT

00:00.535 --> 00:03.197
Okay, bikini, sunscreen, sandals...

00:03.371 --> 00:04.395
What am I forgetting?

00:04.572 --> 00:06.471
A trusted loyal cat.

00:06.641 --> 00:09.007
Right. Let me know if you find one.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.111
Salem, I told you,
this is my bachelorette cruise.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.941
It's for girls only.
Although I have seen you throw a ball.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.776
Fine. I'll stay home.

00:15.950 --> 00:17.383
All alone.

00:17.552 --> 00:19.816
Oh, no, you won't be alone.
Aaron's gonna watch you.

00:19.988 --> 00:21.649
What? I'm a grown man.

00:21.823 --> 00:23.723
I don't need a babysitter.

00:23.892 --> 00:24.916
Yeah, right.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.560
The last time I left you by yourself,

00:26.728 --> 00:28.958
you had enough women through here
to start a sorority.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.098
I told you, they were only here
for choir practice.

00:32.267 --> 00:35.236
I swear, I have no plans whatsoever.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.894
Well, maybe we can confirm that
with a CAT scan.

00:39.874 --> 00:44.106
<i>Okay, who wants to play
Spin The Milk Bottle, hmm?</i>

00:45.213 --> 00:46.510
<i>Kiss me.</i>

00:46.681 --> 00:49.275
Let me guess.
They're a part of your Bible study?

00:49.851 --> 00:52.615
- Um...
- Have fun with Aaron.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:31.726 --> 01:34.160
Here, Aaron.
It's probably best just to keep moving.

01:34.329 --> 01:37.321
Yeah, just point me towards the car.

01:37.699 --> 01:39.257
Okay.

01:39.901 --> 01:42.734
- Wow, handsome and useful.
- Photo op.

01:42.904 --> 01:45.532
This is gonna be the last time
that we are coming down these stairs

01:45.707 --> 01:47.766
as three single women.

01:48.143 --> 01:50.134
She's right. This is it.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.801
It's our last hurrah.

01:51.980 --> 01:54.471
Guys, I'm just getting married.
It doesn't mean we can't hurrah.

01:54.649 --> 01:57.015
We can hurrah, we can hurray,
we can even woo-hoo.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.743
Well, at least in most states.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.115
Oh, all I know is
there's no one I'd rather spend

02:01.289 --> 02:02.881
these last few days with
than you guys.

02:03.057 --> 02:05.685
Oh, that is so sweet.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.851
What if that's the last sweet thing
you ever say...

02:08.029 --> 02:09.826
Just go.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.392
Yeah, I think there's still some room
in the glove compartment.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.400
Well, I'm gonna miss you.

02:16.905 --> 02:18.736
I can't wait for you to get back.

02:18.907 --> 02:21.398
- You are coming back, aren't you?
- Of course I am.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.510
The deposit on the church
is non-refundable.

02:23.678 --> 02:26.772
- Ah, pretty and practical.
- Mm-hm.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.647
Thanks for being so understanding.

02:29.818 --> 02:32.309
It's important for me to have
some quality time with my friends.

02:32.487 --> 02:34.546
Last time the ship went out,
everybody got food poisoning,

02:34.722 --> 02:35.746
so we got a great deal.

02:35.924 --> 02:37.585
Well, have fun. And don't worry.

02:37.759 --> 02:39.590
I'm gonna take great care of Sally.

02:39.761 --> 02:41.228
Uh, his name is Salem.

02:41.396 --> 02:42.886
Yeah, like he knows the difference.

02:43.064 --> 02:44.793
Uh, you'd be surprised.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.898
Bye.

02:49.070 --> 02:51.766
- Sabrina, let's go.
- Come on, the hurrah clock is ticking.

02:51.940 --> 02:53.908
Okay, I'm ready.
Anchors aweigh, girls.

02:54.075 --> 02:56.373
<i>It's time to set sail
on the good ship Lollipop.</i>

03:00.715 --> 03:02.012
Well, there goes Pops.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.845
I wonder which one
of these ladies is, uh, Lolly.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.044
Well,
I guess you got your something old.

03:07.222 --> 03:09.315
And that hair
is definitely something blue.

03:09.491 --> 03:11.652
And they're living on borrowed time,
so...

03:11.826 --> 03:15.023
Shh, they'll hear you. Or not.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.562
- How did this happen?
- I'm sorry.

03:17.732 --> 03:19.461
I thought this cruise
was gonna be real hip,

03:19.634 --> 03:22.228
but I don't think
there's a real hip on this ship.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.428
But look,
we can still have a good time together.

03:24.606 --> 03:26.369
We'll definitely win
the limbo contest.

03:26.541 --> 03:28.771
Yeah, unless that guy
on the gurney enters.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.740
Let's just figure out
where our cabin is.

03:30.912 --> 03:32.470
I guess this should
have been a tip-off:

03:32.647 --> 03:34.945
"Every room equipped
with blow dryer and defibrillator. "

03:35.817 --> 03:37.114
Ladies.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.378
- Enjoy your cruise, Sabrina.
- Thanks.

03:39.554 --> 03:41.021
Wait. How did you know my name?

03:41.189 --> 03:42.816
Ha, ha. It's my job,

03:42.991 --> 03:46.654
and I hope your bachelorette cruise
is everything you wish for.

03:47.996 --> 03:50.726
Do you tip somebody
for creeping you out?

03:51.165 --> 03:53.793
<i>After the war,
brutal dictator Benito Mussolini</i>

03:53.968 --> 03:56.994
<i>finally met a violent end
at the hands of an assassin.</i>

03:57.171 --> 03:59.230
Oh, good old II Duce.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.967
He put the fashion in fascist.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.449
What the?

04:18.192 --> 04:20.956
Hey, paws off the remote.

04:21.129 --> 04:23.324
And kitty off the couch.

04:26.501 --> 04:28.526
Brain the size of a marble.

04:29.137 --> 04:30.502
Listen, pretty boy.

04:30.672 --> 04:34.335
You do not wanna get
into a spray war with me.

04:41.149 --> 04:43.140
Nice music, huh?

04:43.318 --> 04:45.479
Makes you wanna get out
on that dance floor

04:45.653 --> 04:48.019
and shake your walker.

04:48.189 --> 04:49.349
You're missing a photo op.

04:49.524 --> 04:52.789
This may be the last time
we look this hot and feel this bored.

04:54.796 --> 04:56.195
Come on, guys,
what's wrong with us?

04:56.364 --> 04:58.696
We're on a beautiful ship,
we're all together,

04:58.866 --> 05:00.561
and we've all got our original teeth.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.430
Can you say
you're having a fun time?

05:02.604 --> 05:04.162
Yeah, totally. Woo-hoo!

05:04.339 --> 05:06.330
Okay, yeah, I wish it was more fun.

05:08.643 --> 05:12.044
Hello. Enter fun at 2 o'clock.

05:12.213 --> 05:14.613
- Ahoy, mates.
- Up periscope.

05:15.183 --> 05:17.242
Hey. There they are.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.586
Good day, ladies.

05:20.755 --> 05:22.450
Hope you don't mind us
crashing your party,

05:22.624 --> 05:25.422
but the purser said there were
three good-looking sheilas aboard.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.061
Well, thank you. Ha, ha.
Who are the other two?

05:28.630 --> 05:30.655
Oh. Oh, well, I'm Morgan.

05:30.832 --> 05:33.892
And this is Roxie,
and she's getting married.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.467
Also known as Sabrina.

05:35.637 --> 05:37.195
So, uh, where have you guys
been hiding?

05:37.372 --> 05:38.737
It's like you came out of nowhere.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.100
Not nowhere, Australia.

05:40.274 --> 05:42.003
We're headed to Bermuda
for a football match.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.200
Soccer to you Yanks.

05:43.378 --> 05:45.369
Well, soccer to you too.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.611
We were hoping to do
some dancing,

05:47.782 --> 05:51.013
but crikey, the tunes they're playing
are enough to put a wallaby to sleep.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.779
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
Well, without the wallaby.

05:53.955 --> 05:55.980
I wish they'd do something
about the music here.

06:09.065 --> 06:12.159
Wow, Sabrina, I don't know
what you're doing, but keep it up.

06:12.334 --> 06:14.234
Well, let's hit the dance floor, ladies.

06:14.403 --> 06:16.064
- Right.
- Uh, I'll catch up with you guys.

06:16.238 --> 06:19.674
I have to tape my ankle
and figure out what's going on here.

06:19.842 --> 06:22.834
Let's see, I wished for fun,
I wished for music.

06:23.012 --> 06:24.809
Okay, I wish I had a papaya.

06:24.980 --> 06:26.971
Papaya?

06:27.416 --> 06:30.647
- I meant, sliced papaya.
- As you wish.

06:33.055 --> 06:35.717
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you going?

06:35.891 --> 06:39.292
Who are you? And how do you get
your whites so white?

06:49.634 --> 06:50.760
Hello?

06:50.935 --> 06:53.563
Strange smiley man.
Where are you?

06:53.738 --> 06:57.037
Okay, quick pop home
for a little magic book consultation.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.700
Oh, man!
When other people go on vacation,

06:59.878 --> 07:02.369
they just lose their traveler's checks.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.877
Hello? Oh, hey, honey.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.678
Don't tell me you miss me already.

07:08.853 --> 07:11.344
Oh, yeah, I miss you terribly.
Listen, can I talk to Salem?

07:11.523 --> 07:12.751
Excuse me?

07:12.924 --> 07:15.916
He just gets upset
if he doesn't hear my voice every day.

07:16.094 --> 07:18.028
<i>- But...
- This call is costing me $5 a minute.</i>

07:18.196 --> 07:20.790
- Can you just put him on?
- Fine.

07:21.332 --> 07:23.061
It's for you.

07:26.838 --> 07:28.772
Meow?

07:31.242 --> 07:33.836
Listen, have you ever heard of wishes
spontaneously coming true?

07:34.012 --> 07:35.536
Meow one for yes, twice for no.

07:35.713 --> 07:36.907
Not necessary.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.606
Lover boy's busy
paying for my pizza.

07:39.784 --> 07:42.309
Spontaneous wishes
coming true, huh?

07:42.487 --> 07:43.579
Plus my magic isn't working.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.586
I knew
I shouldn't have changed providers.

07:45.757 --> 07:48.851
Hmm, wish fulfillment.
Magic's not working.

07:49.027 --> 07:50.221
Never heard of such a thing.

07:50.395 --> 07:53.762
Unless of course, you happen to be
in the Bermuda Triangle.

07:53.932 --> 07:57.129
Like I would be if I were
on a three-day cruise to Bermuda?

07:57.302 --> 07:59.736
And your problem with this is?

07:59.904 --> 08:01.804
My problem with this is that
I've lost my magic,

08:01.973 --> 08:04.032
but all my wishes are coming true.

08:04.208 --> 08:07.473
Oh, I guess I don't have a problem.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.109
Uh, woof, woof.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.978
I mean, meow, meow.

08:14.686 --> 08:17.211
Hello? Sabrina?

08:19.891 --> 08:23.190
When we get to L.A.,
we are so getting a dog.

08:23.361 --> 08:24.385
Huh?

08:25.964 --> 08:28.159
Well, as long as wishes
are coming true,

08:28.333 --> 08:29.960
I wish there was a full moon.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.429
Not bad.

08:34.606 --> 08:37.073
I wonder why the Triangle
gets such a bad rap.

08:37.241 --> 08:38.503
There you are.

08:39.110 --> 08:41.578
The guys are about to teach us
how to wrestle crocs.

08:41.746 --> 08:44.214
I don't know what that means,
but I'm in. Come on.

08:48.453 --> 08:51.445
And I said,
"That's not a kiwi, that's an emu. "

08:53.725 --> 08:55.852
- Any idea what an emu is?
- None, whatsoever.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.853
I'm sorry, you've completely eaten us
out of popcorn shrimp.

09:00.031 --> 09:01.692
There's not one left on the ship.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.836
I wish we had more popcorn shrimp.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.938
Anyone want some
popcorn shrimp?

09:08.106 --> 09:11.303
Ha-ha-ha.
- Okay, now I really should tip.

09:11.476 --> 09:13.706
Oh, the guys are playing
in Boston next month.

09:13.878 --> 09:15.106
We have to get three tickets...

09:15.279 --> 09:17.907
Oh, wait, we only need two tickets.
Sabrina's not gonna be here.

09:18.082 --> 09:20.676
If they're coming out next month,
they can come with us to the Cape.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.843
- The Cape?
- Yeah, we got a timeshare.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.615
Really? You guys never mentioned
anything about a timeshare.

09:25.790 --> 09:28.452
You were wrapped up in your wedding
plans. It didn't seem important.

09:28.626 --> 09:30.992
Besides, you're moving to L.A.
We didn't think you'd care.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.125
Yeah, I guess I don't.

09:33.297 --> 09:34.821
So Hyannis Port or Chatham?

09:34.999 --> 09:36.296
Oh, it's okay. Doesn't matter.

09:36.467 --> 09:38.833
Either way, I'm sure you guys
will have a great time.

09:39.003 --> 09:41.904
Okay, ladies, less squawking,
more walking, to the dance floor.

09:42.073 --> 09:44.041
Hey, matey,
you got a couple of more tunes in you?

09:44.208 --> 09:45.300
I can be talked into it.

09:45.476 --> 09:47.171
Just as long
as you don't call me Matey.

09:47.345 --> 09:49.040
Fair deuce.

09:57.021 --> 09:59.819
All right, I've had it with you,
you mangy furball.

09:59.991 --> 10:01.583
That's it.

10:05.263 --> 10:07.925
There we go.

10:10.768 --> 10:12.201
Ha.

10:12.637 --> 10:16.300
Okay, maybe I didn't think this
all the way through.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.568
Sabrina, are you okay?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.737
Yeah, you know,
between the shrimp and the accents,

10:23.915 --> 10:25.906
I'm just a little down under.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.449
- Really, I'm fine.
- Oh, good.

10:27.618 --> 10:30.712
No, something's wrong. What is it?

10:31.456 --> 10:32.923
Well...

10:33.357 --> 10:36.349
You know how we were joking around
about this being our last hurrah?

10:36.527 --> 10:38.927
Well, then I realized, yeah, it is.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.622
When we get off this ship,
everything is gonna be different.

10:41.799 --> 10:43.767
You said that just because
you're getting married,

10:43.935 --> 10:45.800
it doesn't mean
anything's gonna change.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.632
But how can it not? I'm moving
to the other side of the country.

10:48.806 --> 10:52.970
And you guys will be back in Boston,
living your lives, dating soccer teams.

10:53.144 --> 10:56.409
Oh, you think so?
Because they are so cute.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.614
But this is really sad.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.479
In fact, let's take a picture.

11:01.652 --> 11:03.586
Last time
we're all really sad together.

11:03.755 --> 11:06.383
Can you dispose of that disposable?

11:06.557 --> 11:08.616
Sabrina, everything's gonna be fine.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.051
Yeah,
but how can you know for sure?

11:11.229 --> 11:14.164
I mean, I just wish I knew
if our friendship was gonna survive.

11:15.933 --> 11:17.867
Iceberg!

11:18.035 --> 11:20.833
- What? I didn't mean to wish that.
- Hurry. Follow me to the lifeboat.

11:21.005 --> 11:22.302
Oh, my God. We're gonna die.

11:22.473 --> 11:23.906
Not what I meant when I said "wish. "

11:25.977 --> 11:27.069
Come back.

11:27.245 --> 11:28.974
Come back.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.580
They're not coming back.

11:30.748 --> 11:33.342
I can't believe we're the only idiots
that got into a lifeboat.

11:33.518 --> 11:36.385
I can't believe the iceberg
didn't even hurt the ship.

11:36.554 --> 11:39.284
Or that there was an iceberg
in tropical waters.

11:39.457 --> 11:41.322
How did this happen?

11:41.492 --> 11:45.360
You ever hear the expression,
"Careful what you wish for?"

11:53.037 --> 11:54.629
I wish we were at home.

11:54.806 --> 11:56.740
I wish the ship would turn around.

11:56.908 --> 11:58.967
I wish my wishes were still working.

11:59.143 --> 12:02.374
Sounds like someone's two seconds
away from talking to a volleyball.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.105
I wish I had a volleyball.

12:04.282 --> 12:06.045
Oh, why isn't this working?

12:06.217 --> 12:08.515
Uh, no magic lamp. No lucky penny.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.052
No sugar daddy. You do the math.

12:11.222 --> 12:14.191
Well, as long as we're gonna die,
you might as well take a picture.

12:14.358 --> 12:15.882
No, no one's dying. Okay?

12:16.060 --> 12:18.221
We just lived through an iceberg,
a night in a lifeboat,

12:18.396 --> 12:20.125
and some very questionable
popcorn shrimp.

12:20.298 --> 12:22.664
Don't you get it? We survived.

12:22.834 --> 12:24.461
I just have a feeling
that any moment now,

12:24.635 --> 12:25.897
we're gonna get off this island.

12:27.271 --> 12:29.671
Hey, look, there's a plane.
I didn't even have to wish for it.

12:29.841 --> 12:32.002
Over here! Over here!

12:32.176 --> 12:34.041
He seems to be going over there,
over there.

12:35.479 --> 12:37.242
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

12:37.415 --> 12:39.110
Wow, look at that.

12:40.484 --> 12:43.817
You don't see a lot of mountains
that spit out smoke and lava.

12:43.988 --> 12:46.422
Unless it's an active volcano.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.320
Well, it's official.

12:48.492 --> 12:51.052
- We're gonna die.
- No, no one's dying.

12:53.998 --> 12:55.329
At least not one of us.

12:55.499 --> 12:57.763
Look, I'm gonna go get some answers
and some firewood.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.729
Good luck.

12:59.904 --> 13:03.067
Yeah, like firewood grows on trees.

13:04.442 --> 13:06.433
You. Hey,
I know you're behind all this craziness.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.306
No sane person
would wear those shorts.

13:08.479 --> 13:10.674
Look, I want off this island,
and I want off it now.

13:11.515 --> 13:13.278
Hi, Bob Bermuda.

13:13.451 --> 13:15.078
Welcome to my Triangle.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.447
Your Triangle?

13:16.621 --> 13:18.748
Yeah, it's a family business left to me
by my father

13:18.923 --> 13:20.584
who mysteriously disappeared.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.589
Occupational hazard. Ha-ha-ha.

13:23.227 --> 13:25.718
So is being beaten senseless
with a coconut.

13:25.897 --> 13:28.593
Look, I know I wished to know
if our friendship would survive.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.256
Well, guess what. It did.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.959
- Game over, send us home.
- You call that surviving?

13:33.137 --> 13:34.729
You practically fell into a lifeboat,

13:34.906 --> 13:38.239
washed up on a deserted island
without even having to lift a paddle.

13:38.409 --> 13:40.036
You haven't even eaten a rat yet.

13:40.211 --> 13:41.644
No, but I can smell one.

13:41.812 --> 13:43.473
And what about this wish thing?

13:43.648 --> 13:46.014
I mean, uh, how come my wishes
stopped working?

13:46.183 --> 13:48.413
One wish at a time.
You're still working on the last one.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.948
Well, now there's something
you don't see every day.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.423
A tidal wave.

13:56.594 --> 13:58.357
Excuse me.
I forgot to shut my windows.

13:58.529 --> 14:00.360
Whoa. Tidal wave?
What are we supposed to do?

14:00.531 --> 14:02.624
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.268
- Here.
- Thanks.

14:08.773 --> 14:10.263
He is so...

14:10.441 --> 14:12.341
Yeah, tidal wave.

14:12.510 --> 14:14.876
Aah, almost there. Ha, ha.

14:15.046 --> 14:16.445
No.

14:20.284 --> 14:23.185
I can't believe that she's giving you
the leftover chicken salad.

14:25.723 --> 14:26.747
Whoa.

14:26.924 --> 14:28.687
Don't wanna lose this, do we, kitty?

14:32.263 --> 14:36.097
This means war!

14:37.435 --> 14:40.131
And I thought seaweed wraps
were supposed to be relaxing.

14:40.304 --> 14:43.137
And, Morgan, where'd you learn
to scale a palm tree like that?

14:43.307 --> 14:46.902
Do you have any idea what a 20-foot
wall of water would do to my hair?

14:47.411 --> 14:49.345
Yeah, kind of.

14:49.513 --> 14:50.946
Iceberg. Weird.

14:51.115 --> 14:52.707
Lost at sea? Scary.

14:52.883 --> 14:55.852
But the tidal wave? This is officially
the worst bachelorette party ever.

14:58.422 --> 15:00.754
Guys,
I think we've got bigger problems.

15:00.925 --> 15:02.620
I'm guessing those storm clouds
on the horizon

15:02.793 --> 15:04.522
aren't gonna be
a refreshing tropical rain.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.959
- So now you're a weather girl?
- We prefer meteorologist.

15:07.131 --> 15:08.758
I'm just saying we need
to find a shelter

15:08.933 --> 15:10.093
and we need to find one now.

15:10.267 --> 15:13.759
I'm saying I've gotta get something
to eat before I starve to death.

15:14.405 --> 15:16.396
Morgan,
give me your shoe to crack this.

15:16.574 --> 15:18.769
Oh, at $500 a pair, I don't think so.

15:18.943 --> 15:21.741
Guys, focus.
Hurricane on the horizon.

15:21.912 --> 15:23.379
- Give me your freaking shoe.
- No.

15:23.547 --> 15:24.741
Where does it stop?

15:25.282 --> 15:26.306
You trash my stilettos,

15:26.484 --> 15:29.146
next thing we know we are smearing
pig's blood all over our faces.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.845
And suddenly, it's like something
out of Lord of the Dance.

15:32.423 --> 15:34.584
- Don't.
- Guys.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.655
Can we please
channel all this negative energy

15:36.827 --> 15:38.351
into building a storm shelter?

15:38.529 --> 15:41.157
Well, I guess I missed it when you
claimed this beach for Sabrinia.

15:41.332 --> 15:44.631
Oh, shelter's a number one priority.
Why don't we just dig our own grave?

15:44.802 --> 15:45.826
Look, Ms. Doom and Gloom,

15:46.003 --> 15:48.028
lose the attitude
and make yourself useful.

15:48.205 --> 15:51.197
It would be nice if just once,
you didn't try to run everything.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.900
And it would be nice
if just once I didn't have to.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.636
Now I'm trying to save your lives.

15:55.813 --> 15:57.678
Maybe you could do
your whole save-the-day act

15:57.848 --> 16:00.078
before the elements
completely destroy my skin.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.845
This just in, Morgan.
Nobody cares about your skin.

16:03.020 --> 16:04.749
And nobody cares what you think.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.446
Oh, wait, let's take a picture.

16:06.624 --> 16:08.888
This will be the last photo
I can cut you two out of.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.221
I can't believe I was upset
about moving away from you.

16:11.395 --> 16:13.454
Suddenly, 3,000 miles isn't enough.

16:13.631 --> 16:15.792
Well, don't let the palm frond
hit you on your way out.

16:15.966 --> 16:18.935
Oh, so it's true.
If you want something done right,

16:19.103 --> 16:20.900
I have to show everyone else
how to do it.

16:21.072 --> 16:24.735
Well, I don't need you to show me
how to do anything.

16:25.976 --> 16:28.604
My shoe. My coconut.

16:28.779 --> 16:31.373
Fine, go ahead.
I'll build the shelter by myself.

16:31.549 --> 16:33.380
While you two are being blown
over the rainbow,

16:33.551 --> 16:35.576
give my regards to Glinda.

16:35.753 --> 16:38.244
I still have to thank her
for that shower gift.

16:38.422 --> 16:40.549
Okay, Bob, point made.
My friendship won't survive.

16:40.724 --> 16:42.817
Thanks for the heads up.
Kind of like to go home now.

16:43.761 --> 16:45.888
Bob? Mr. Bermuda?

16:46.363 --> 16:49.389
It's like I'm shouting in the wind here.
And spitting.

16:51.602 --> 16:53.331
And running.

16:57.875 --> 17:01.038
Oh, my God. Oh, no, no, no.

17:01.212 --> 17:04.113
Oh, Sabrina is going to kill me.

17:04.281 --> 17:06.249
Come on, kitty. Come on.

17:06.416 --> 17:09.352
No, no, no. No, no, no.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.785
Kitty? Kitty?

17:11.955 --> 17:14.151
- Okay, what do I do? What do I do?
- Ha, ha.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.417
Uh, I bury it.

17:16.594 --> 17:18.686
Uh, garbage bags.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.762
Freezer. What a...

17:22.733 --> 17:24.826
Oh, I am so gonna kill that cat.

17:27.771 --> 17:29.432
Out of my way. This is my lifeboat.

17:29.607 --> 17:31.472
No, yours would be called
the get-a-life boat.

17:31.642 --> 17:33.633
Hey, besides, I saw it first.

17:33.811 --> 17:35.574
The reason I'm in this mess
is because of you.

17:35.746 --> 17:37.373
The least you can do is let me live.

17:37.548 --> 17:38.810
Oh, thank you.

17:38.983 --> 17:40.644
Hey!

17:44.522 --> 17:46.046
Well, it's all yours.

17:46.223 --> 17:47.952
Once again,
thank you, Sabrina Spellman.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.723
At the risk of sounding bossy,

17:52.897 --> 17:55.058
help me move these trees
and cover them with branches.

17:55.232 --> 17:57.223
- Now.
- Not there, the ground's too low.

17:57.401 --> 17:59.562
Over there,
we can use the rock as a foundation.

17:59.737 --> 18:02.331
But we don't have anything to tie
the branches together with.

18:02.506 --> 18:03.598
Waxed or mint?

18:03.774 --> 18:06.641
Come on, girls.
Puts your backs into it.

18:13.651 --> 18:15.278
Oh, no.

18:22.826 --> 18:24.487
Oh, no.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.292
Well, I'll just go around back.

18:28.365 --> 18:29.957
Oh, no.

18:31.435 --> 18:34.063
It's a little early for a full moon.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.933
It's over. The storm's over.

18:40.110 --> 18:41.407
The coast is clear.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.547
Suddenly that expression
makes sense.

18:43.714 --> 18:46.615
I can't believe it. We're not dead.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.478
Oh, thank God I made it.

18:51.655 --> 18:52.952
Oh, and you guys did too.

18:53.123 --> 18:55.523
Yay, we survived.

18:57.294 --> 18:58.727
You know, if we were talking,

18:58.896 --> 19:01.456
I'd thank you, Roxie, for pointing out
where to build the shelter.

19:01.632 --> 19:04.032
The place I wanted to build it is
under 6 feet of debris.

19:04.201 --> 19:06.635
You're welcome.
And if I were talking to you,

19:06.804 --> 19:09.272
I guess I'd say if it weren't for you
bossing us around...

19:09.440 --> 19:13.103
I mean, taking charge.
- We'd be a seagull buffet.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.301
And, Morgan,

19:14.478 --> 19:16.776
if it wasn't for your bottomless
supply of beauty products,

19:16.947 --> 19:18.346
we probably wouldn't have made it.

19:18.515 --> 19:21.245
Yeah, that eyebrow wax
really slowed up that leak.

19:21.418 --> 19:23.886
By the way, that stuff's not cheap.

19:24.722 --> 19:28.123
You know what I just realized?
We have nothing to worry about.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.455
Our friendship is gonna survive,
as long as we all make the effort.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.028
Well, yeah.

19:33.197 --> 19:35.597
You're the only one
who ever doubted it.

19:35.766 --> 19:37.700
And speaking of making the effort...

19:39.403 --> 19:43.134
Sabrina, I've been saying this along.
We'll be friends for life.

19:46.410 --> 19:47.934
Okay, now wait.
We're three smart girls.

19:48.112 --> 19:50.444
We should be able to find our way
off a deserted island.

19:50.614 --> 19:52.775
Heads up. Hey, there you are.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.349
We wondered
what happened to you.

19:54.518 --> 19:56.213
- What are you guys doing here?
- What?

19:56.387 --> 19:57.911
We told you
we've got a tournament here.

19:58.088 --> 20:00.556
- This is Bermuda?
- Yeah.

20:00.724 --> 20:02.885
Well, come on, then.
The team's partying down the beach.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.925
You are not gonna believe this.
We thought...

20:05.095 --> 20:06.119
Uh, uh, uh.

20:06.297 --> 20:08.458
- Three smart girls, remember?
- Oh, right, right.

20:09.533 --> 20:10.966
You're not gonna believe this.

20:11.135 --> 20:12.693
- We thought...
- Let's just go.

20:15.739 --> 20:18.970
Nothing like a category four hurricane
to really clear the air.

20:19.410 --> 20:22.345
Okay, I don't agree with the method,
but the message isn't bad.

20:22.513 --> 20:23.980
Learn a little something, did we?

20:24.148 --> 20:25.445
Yeah, the next time I'm stranded,

20:25.616 --> 20:28.016
I'll walk more than 50 feet
down the beach.

20:28.652 --> 20:31.485
I wish just once
someone would say thank you.

20:31.655 --> 20:33.748
Oh, thank you.

20:35.459 --> 20:37.791
Morgan, wait.
Do you still have your camera?

20:37.961 --> 20:40.725
- Only one picture left.
- Heads up.

20:42.132 --> 20:44.066
Three friends
who can survive anything.

20:51.575 --> 20:55.067
Oh, I've never been so happy
to be home from a vacation

20:55.245 --> 20:56.507
in my entire life.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.171
Yeah, don't get too comfortable.
We are in full wedding mode.

20:59.350 --> 21:01.113
I'm getting married
in less than 24 hours.

21:01.285 --> 21:03.583
Move it, ladies! Is that too bossy?

21:04.121 --> 21:05.452
Not for marriage.

21:06.690 --> 21:08.419
Aaron?

21:09.727 --> 21:11.592
<i>Sabrina, it's Aaron.</i>

21:11.762 --> 21:13.855
<i>I need you to pick me up
at the police station.</i>

21:14.031 --> 21:16.465
<i>And bring me some clothes.
Long story.</i>

21:16.633 --> 21:18.624
Locked out without his clothes,
huh?

21:18.802 --> 21:21.134
Brain the size of a marble.

21:21.305 --> 21:24.001
When we get to L.A.,
we are so getting a dog.

21:24.174 --> 21:25.835
Guh?

21:34.385 --> 21:38.219
Okay, bride-to-be. Up and at them.

21:38.655 --> 21:40.384
Hey, wake up.

21:40.557 --> 21:44.049
Don't make me put your hand
in warm water again.

21:44.228 --> 21:45.593
Morning.

21:45.763 --> 21:49.631
Well, I guess your breath explains
my trapped in the tuna boat dream.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.131
Well, can you believe it?

21:51.301 --> 21:54.327
I'm actually getting married today.
Woo-hoo!

21:54.505 --> 21:55.938
So how do you feel?

21:56.106 --> 21:58.631
Nervous, frightened,
scared, tense, petrified?

21:58.809 --> 22:00.003
Excited, happy, joyful.

22:00.177 --> 22:01.940
I'm getting married.
How do you think I feel?

22:02.112 --> 22:04.137
Nervous, frightened, scared.

22:04.314 --> 22:07.044
I just wanna make sure
you're not getting cold feet.

22:07.217 --> 22:09.651
Salem, I do not have cold feet.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.218
See?

22:14.391 --> 22:15.653
They're not cold.

22:15.826 --> 22:17.293
They're frozen solid.

22:19.396 --> 22:22.456
Don't care what your invoice says, no
one is getting married in this kitchen.

22:22.633 --> 22:25.431
Yes, for the 10,000th time,
I am positive.

22:25.602 --> 22:28.298
- Get off the parkway and take a right.
- Left.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.372
Get off the parkway and take a left.

22:30.541 --> 22:32.372
It's just down the street.
Church, steeple.

22:32.543 --> 22:35.478
You'll open the door
and see all the people. Go.

22:35.879 --> 22:38.040
What's going on?
Why aren't the flowers at the church?

22:38.215 --> 22:39.341
Why aren't you guys ready?

22:39.516 --> 22:41.381
"Is there anything I can do?" I ask.

22:41.552 --> 22:43.611
"Oh, no, Mother, just stay out of it,"
he says.

22:43.787 --> 22:46.187
- Well, if you ask me...
- Mother, just stay out of it.

22:46.356 --> 22:48.483
Aaron, don't worry,
we've got it all under control.

22:48.659 --> 22:49.683
Under control?

22:49.860 --> 22:53.296
I still have to do my hair and my nails,
and my makeup has to be perfect.

22:53.464 --> 22:55.489
Some of us don't have the option
of wearing a veil.

22:56.066 --> 22:58.296
Oh, my God.
I still have to steam Sabrina's veil.

22:58.936 --> 23:01.131
Something tells me
I'm not getting breakfast.

23:01.305 --> 23:04.468
From this kitchen? Ha, ha.
Count your blessings.

23:04.641 --> 23:08.304
Okay, okay, please, please just tell me
that Sabrina is a little further along.

23:08.479 --> 23:10.106
Yes. Morgan got her up hours ago.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.544
I didn't get her up.
You were supposed to get her up.

23:12.716 --> 23:15.446
Will you excuse us
for just one second?

23:15.619 --> 23:16.984
Oh, uh, his name is Al.

23:17.154 --> 23:18.815
He's got 300 pounds of shrimp
in his trunk,

23:18.989 --> 23:20.456
and he doesn't know where to put it.

23:20.624 --> 23:23.593
Give the phone to your mother.
She'll tell him where to put it.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.620
Hurry up.

23:26.797 --> 23:29.027
Hey, I told you not to lick it.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.064
- Aah.
- There. Oh.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.567
Sure I'll get the feeling back
before I walk down the aisle.

23:33.737 --> 23:35.364
Sabrina, aren't your worried?

23:35.539 --> 23:37.803
This obviously happened
for a reason.

23:37.975 --> 23:39.966
The only reason it happened
is because I'm a witch.

23:40.143 --> 23:42.441
Which just means that magic
is always messing up my life.

23:42.613 --> 23:43.705
Sabrina, wake up.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.405
Oh, good, you're up.
I'm off the hook.

23:45.582 --> 23:47.777
You've got to hurry and...
What's going on?

23:47.951 --> 23:49.714
Oh, uh, well, it just occurred to me

23:49.887 --> 23:52.549
that I might not have ordered
enough crushed ice for the reception.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.748
Well, it's showtime
and I am not gonna have you

23:54.925 --> 23:56.256
screwing up my big day.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.990
Your big day. I mean...

23:59.162 --> 24:01.562
She means everything's under control.
You've gotta get dressed.

24:01.732 --> 24:05.668
Oh, and don't forget your something
old, new, borrowed and blue.

24:05.836 --> 24:07.360
Got it, except for the something old,

24:07.538 --> 24:09.938
and the something new,
and the something borrowed.

24:10.107 --> 24:12.234
And my toes are kind of blue.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.501
My God, what am I gonna do?

24:13.677 --> 24:15.474
- We'll take care of it.
- Oh, why not?

24:15.646 --> 24:17.807
We're apparently
taking care of everything else.

24:17.981 --> 24:19.778
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

24:19.950 --> 24:21.247
Sabrina, are you okay?

24:21.418 --> 24:23.818
It's not like you
to not be on top of everything.

24:23.987 --> 24:26.820
The flowers, the caterer.
And you're an hour behind schedule.

24:26.990 --> 24:30.016
Which is why I can't be standing here
having this conversation. I'm fine.

24:30.193 --> 24:32.058
I just need a few minutes
to collect my thoughts.

24:33.964 --> 24:37.422
Okay, thoughts collected.
And thoughts lost.

24:37.601 --> 24:41.093
Hi. Oh, congratulations, Sabrina.
I am so happy for you.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.636
Thanks, I'm kind of in a panic here

24:42.806 --> 24:44.831
so I don't have time
for your teen 'tude right now.

24:45.008 --> 24:48.239
- What's up with her?
- She's having second thoughts.

24:48.412 --> 24:50.744
- Ha, ha. Oh.
- Mm-hm.

24:50.914 --> 24:52.711
No. No "ha, ha. " No "mm-hm. "

24:52.883 --> 24:53.907
And no second thoughts.

24:54.084 --> 24:55.984
Maybe I'm having some regrets,

24:56.153 --> 24:58.383
but that's only because
many people I love can't be here.

24:58.555 --> 25:00.955
I mean, my mom's in Peru.
You never know about my dad.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.024
I have no idea why my aunts
haven't RSVP'd.

25:03.193 --> 25:05.161
- Is Harvey coming?
- No, Harvey's not coming.

25:05.329 --> 25:07.490
- Well, don't you want him there?
- I don't know.

25:07.664 --> 25:10.792
Yes, I would love to have Harvey there.
But he just can't be.

25:10.968 --> 25:12.196
You're too young to understand.

25:12.369 --> 25:15.338
Sabrina, could you
come down here? Quickly.

25:15.906 --> 25:20.673
So the bride isn't the only one
whose voice is tinged with terror.

25:20.844 --> 25:22.436
See, that's your problem.

25:22.613 --> 25:24.979
You can't tell the difference
between terror and pure joy.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.639
Sabrina!
- I'm coming!

25:30.320 --> 25:32.720
Uh, don't touch the Ilama. It's a gift.

25:32.889 --> 25:37.155
I suggest patio furniture.
But no, that's too out there.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.454
- Aunt Hilda?
- Hi, honey.

25:39.630 --> 25:41.291
- Oh, you came.
- Of course.

25:41.465 --> 25:43.228
And you brought me a Ilama.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.300
- I hope you don't already have one.
- Ha, ha.

25:45.469 --> 25:48.700
- Sabrina, honey, what's going on?
- Oh, Aaron, this is my Aunt Hilda.

25:48.872 --> 25:50.305
Aunt Hilda, my Aaron.
Isn't he great?

25:50.474 --> 25:52.237
- Isn't she great?
- Yeah, she's great.

25:52.409 --> 25:54.468
Did we register for pack animals?

25:54.645 --> 25:57.205
Hey, cut me some slack. There's not
a lot you can pick up in Peru.

25:57.381 --> 25:59.315
It was either this, or dysentery.

25:59.483 --> 26:01.246
You were in Peru?
Did you see my mom?

26:01.418 --> 26:04.512
- Yes, and you cannot believe...
- Uh, let's talk in the kitchen.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.121
Okay.

26:07.591 --> 26:09.183
Uh, I swear,
I'll be ready in two minutes.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.690
Uh, chat with my cousin Amanda.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.021
She's surly, yet charming.

26:12.195 --> 26:14.493
- Say something surly for the Jacobs.
- Hi.

26:14.665 --> 26:16.223
Oh, look at you. Ha, ha.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.801
It's so hard to find bridesmaid's dress
that looks good on everyone.

26:19.970 --> 26:21.961
Hey, I have melted people
for less than that.

26:22.139 --> 26:25.836
Okay, no pointing at the in-laws.
At least not until after the wedding.

26:27.010 --> 26:29.570
So you saw my mom?
What did she say? How'd she look?

26:29.746 --> 26:31.976
Why don't you ask her yourself?

26:32.649 --> 26:35.743
- Mom!
- Sweetheart, I'm so happy for you.

26:35.919 --> 26:38.080
Can't believe you're here.
And you're not a ball of wax.

26:38.255 --> 26:39.552
You can thank Hilda and Zelda.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.385
They took me in the Witches' Council
and pleaded my case.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.493
Every mother should be
at her daughter's wedding.

26:44.661 --> 26:47.027
Preferably not as something
you can stick a wick in.

26:47.197 --> 26:48.596
Thank you so much.

26:48.765 --> 26:50.164
But where's Aunt Zelda?

26:50.867 --> 26:54.325
Well, you know the Witches' Council.
There's always a trade off.

26:55.205 --> 26:56.968
- Aunt Zelda?
Yep.

26:57.607 --> 27:00.667
Well, they asked for a volunteer,
so I volunteered her.

27:00.844 --> 27:02.539
Don't worry.
Just till after the wedding.

27:02.713 --> 27:04.010
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

27:04.181 --> 27:07.480
This is the greatest gift. I'm suddenly
feeling a thousand percent better.

27:07.651 --> 27:09.915
Can you believe it?
All the Spellman women together again.

27:10.087 --> 27:12.282
And most of us in human form.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.515
Wait. Where's Amanda?

27:15.859 --> 27:18.054
- Hi, Harvey.
- Aah!

27:27.003 --> 27:29.904
- Surprised to see me?
- Not at all.

27:30.073 --> 27:33.600
I wanted to test my new engine
by ramming it into a tree.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.267
What are you doing here?

27:35.445 --> 27:37.003
I wanna bring you
to Sabrina's wedding.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.740
Apparently,
she loves getting people as gifts.

27:39.916 --> 27:42.544
I'm sorry, but there is no way
I am going to that wedding.

27:42.719 --> 27:44.414
Gift wrapped or otherwise.

27:44.588 --> 27:47.079
But I know Sabrina wants you there.

27:47.257 --> 27:49.054
She does?

27:49.359 --> 27:51.486
That's too bad.
It's not gonna happen.

27:51.661 --> 27:54.528
- Why not?
- You're too young to understand.

27:54.698 --> 27:57.531
Oh, I really wish people
would quit saying that.

27:57.701 --> 28:00.329
I wonder if it's too late
to go halfsies on that Ilama.

28:01.037 --> 28:02.061
Amanda, wait.

28:02.239 --> 28:04.332
The nearest phone
is a 15-mile walk.

28:04.508 --> 28:05.532
Oh, heh. Sorry.

28:07.744 --> 28:09.109
What is this?
Fun with mortals week?

28:09.279 --> 28:11.179
Ha, ha.
Yeah, like mortals are ever fun.

28:16.686 --> 28:19.211
Sabrina, I know the number one rule
about being a maid of honor

28:19.389 --> 28:22.722
is, "don't upstage the bride,"
but if you're gonna make it so easy...

28:22.893 --> 28:25.054
Don't worry, two minutes,
I'll be absolutely dazzling.

28:25.228 --> 28:27.992
Wear this. It's old, it's blue
and I borrowed it from you.

28:28.398 --> 28:29.956
Oh, and that stain, it's new.

28:30.767 --> 28:33.031
Thanks, but I kind of already have
an outfit picked out.

28:33.203 --> 28:35.171
Sabrina, come on.
What are you doing?

28:35.338 --> 28:36.930
I know, I know, two minutes.
I swear.

28:37.107 --> 28:39.803
Two minutes ago is when we
supposed to have left for the church.

28:39.976 --> 28:41.534
But I'm glad you're in a better mood.

28:41.711 --> 28:44.441
I am. My family's all here
and all is right with the world.

28:44.614 --> 28:46.980
I'm glad. I don't want you going
into this with any doubts.

28:47.150 --> 28:49.675
Doubts? I was never doubting.

28:51.755 --> 28:54.087
If that's true,
I'm definitely in the wrong place.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.750
- Do I know you?
- I doubt it.

28:56.927 --> 28:58.326
I'm Doubt.

28:58.495 --> 29:01.157
Apparently, there's some serious
doubting going on around here.

29:01.331 --> 29:02.593
No. No Doubt.

29:02.766 --> 29:05.428
Although their last CD
was one of my favorites.

29:05.602 --> 29:07.866
Look, for the last time,
I'm not doubting anything.

29:08.038 --> 29:09.198
The man I love is downstairs.

29:09.372 --> 29:12.034
I've got hundreds of people
cooling their jets in pews across town.

29:12.209 --> 29:13.767
And my mom just flew in from Peru.

29:13.944 --> 29:15.741
I'm getting married.

29:16.146 --> 29:20.981
I guess I went all the way
to the North Star for nothing.

29:23.653 --> 29:25.280
Oh, it's so beautiful.

29:25.455 --> 29:27.685
That's the essence of who Aaron is.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.587
- This is Aaron's soul stone?
- Exactly.

29:32.762 --> 29:36.721
Hey, for me, that was pretty definitive.
I think.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.367
I'll tell you something definitive.

29:38.535 --> 29:40.196
You're tap dancing
on my last good nerve.

29:40.370 --> 29:41.428
Why are you giving me this?

29:41.605 --> 29:43.095
That's what you're doubting, isn't it?

29:43.273 --> 29:45.571
Whether or not you and Aaron
are soul mates?

29:45.742 --> 29:46.766
No.

29:46.943 --> 29:48.911
Well, maybe.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.910
L...
Can you ever really know for sure?

29:51.081 --> 29:53.515
Aah! Why are you doing this to me
on my wedding day?

29:53.683 --> 29:54.741
Better than the day after.

29:55.819 --> 29:58.913
If it's truly meant to be, your pieces
should fit together perfectly.

30:00.357 --> 30:02.052
If you wanna be certain,

30:02.225 --> 30:04.216
the answer is waiting for you
at the North Star.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.096
But I am certain.

30:07.264 --> 30:08.629
I love Aaron.

30:08.798 --> 30:12.097
Well,
at least I'm pretty certain I'm certain.

30:12.269 --> 30:13.566
Sabrina, what's the hold up?

30:13.737 --> 30:15.728
Aaron and his parents
just left for the church.

30:15.906 --> 30:17.339
I know, I know.
Two minutes, I swear.

30:17.507 --> 30:20.374
I just have to point at my hair...
Do my hair, and I'll be right there.

30:20.543 --> 30:22.568
I'm still working on
the something blue.

30:22.746 --> 30:24.475
How do you feel about blue cheese?

30:24.648 --> 30:26.741
Ooh, already wearing a wheel of Brie.

30:28.485 --> 30:30.248
Oh, I don't have time for this
right now.

30:30.420 --> 30:33.412
Okay, one ping and I'm all ready.

30:34.224 --> 30:35.714
Okay, two pings.

30:35.892 --> 30:39.658
<i>One place in heaven is always true
Help me to know before I say I do</i>

30:39.829 --> 30:41.524
What about a blue...?

30:41.698 --> 30:43.256
Sabrina?

30:44.901 --> 30:47.267
Wow, so this is the North Star.

30:47.437 --> 30:48.961
<i>Welcome to the North Star system.</i>

30:49.139 --> 30:50.697
<i>May I help you?</i>

30:50.874 --> 30:53.934
Oh, hi, I'm Sabrina Spellman,
and I'm getting married in like, now.

30:54.110 --> 30:55.134
So I was wondering...

30:55.312 --> 30:57.610
<i>Exact nature of your problem,
please?</i>

30:57.781 --> 30:59.840
Oh, I am, uh, just looking
for my soul stone,

31:00.016 --> 31:02.007
but I wouldn't mind taking a ride
on the soul train.

31:02.185 --> 31:04.551
I mean, you know,
only if you're serving soul food.

31:05.355 --> 31:07.949
Hello? Am I the sole person here?

31:08.858 --> 31:10.519
You know,
everybody thinks you ran away.

31:10.694 --> 31:13.128
What? No, no running,
just some popping.

31:13.296 --> 31:16.629
- Look, tell everyone I'll be there in...
- I know, I know, two minutes.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.859
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, everything's fine.

31:19.035 --> 31:20.059
Just please go.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.278
They fit, they fit!

31:33.450 --> 31:35.247
Almost.

31:35.785 --> 31:36.979
No.

31:37.153 --> 31:38.848
What am I supposed to say?

31:39.022 --> 31:41.422
I almost do?

31:56.673 --> 31:58.868
Sabrina, are you in there? Open up.

31:59.042 --> 32:02.239
Just a minute.
Just smoothing out some rough edges.

32:06.816 --> 32:09.341
Almost. I mean, pretty close.

32:09.519 --> 32:12.352
And like they say,
"Close only counts in horseshoes,

32:12.522 --> 32:14.183
hand grenades, and soul mates. "

32:17.160 --> 32:19.151
Salem, what am I gonna do?

32:19.329 --> 32:23.789
Well, if your father was here, he'd say,
it's time to have "the talk. "

32:24.234 --> 32:27.533
Sabrina, when a young woman...

32:27.704 --> 32:29.171
There you are. We were so worried.

32:29.339 --> 32:31.671
There were no cute guys here
until the best man showed up.

32:31.841 --> 32:33.240
Can I ask you guys something?

32:33.410 --> 32:35.071
I mean, you know I love Aaron,
right?

32:35.245 --> 32:37.145
It's pretty obvious
we're meant to be together.

32:37.313 --> 32:39.042
Yeah, you guys are great together.

32:39.215 --> 32:42.116
Honey, are you okay?
Everyone's waiting out there.

32:42.285 --> 32:44.150
Sabrina, what is your Uncle Mortimer
doing here?

32:44.320 --> 32:45.685
You know I can't stand him.

32:45.855 --> 32:48.619
Not to alarm you,
but everything is a total disaster.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.384
The soloist hasn't arrived,

32:50.560 --> 32:52.391
and the organist is drunk
behind the rectory.

32:52.562 --> 32:54.621
Look, Sabrina doesn't need
to hear that right now.

32:54.798 --> 32:57.062
You don't see me here
telling her that the ring bearer

32:57.233 --> 32:58.996
is yakking all over the men's room.

32:59.169 --> 33:01.330
- I kept that to myself.
- People, let's move it along.

33:01.504 --> 33:04.234
The minister is about to go into
double-time, and I'm not paying.

33:06.509 --> 33:08.170
Hey, can I just...?

33:08.344 --> 33:09.834
Hello?

33:12.248 --> 33:13.875
Okay, listen up.

33:14.050 --> 33:16.382
Mrs. Spellman, go tell the minister
to preach patience.

33:16.553 --> 33:18.316
Mom, Dad, please do
something about the music.

33:18.488 --> 33:21.082
And, Hilda, just go feed your Ilama.

33:21.257 --> 33:23.248
I would like to have a moment
with Sabrina.

33:23.426 --> 33:25.291
Hey, you are not allowed
to be in here right now.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.191
You can't see the bride
in her wedding dress.

33:27.363 --> 33:30.230
But if I don't, I'm afraid
there may not be a wedding.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.992
- So...
- Yes.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.506
So...

33:43.813 --> 33:44.871
What's going on?

33:45.048 --> 33:47.983
Oh, you know, I'm just a little nervous
and a little anxious,

33:48.151 --> 33:50.346
and, uh, I think I left the oven on.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.544
I should go check on that.

33:51.721 --> 33:55.122
Sabrina, look, I know
that you're scared and having doubts.

33:55.291 --> 33:56.553
Believe me, I am too.

33:56.726 --> 34:00.025
Yeah, but yours don't leave
peanut shells in your dust ruffle.

34:00.797 --> 34:02.264
Do you think we're soul mates?

34:02.432 --> 34:03.558
Soul mates?

34:03.733 --> 34:06.065
Do you mean,
are we destined to be together?

34:06.236 --> 34:07.703
Yeah, two halves of a whole.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.600
Yin and yang. Ben and Jerry.

34:09.772 --> 34:12.467
Sabrina, ha, ha,
life doesn't have any guarantees.

34:12.641 --> 34:16.442
I mean, all we can do
is try to make each other happy.

34:17.313 --> 34:18.746
There's one thing I don't doubt.

34:20.483 --> 34:22.246
That I love you.

34:22.918 --> 34:24.476
I love you too.

34:24.853 --> 34:27.083
Well, sounds like a pretty good
foundation for something.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.992
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

34:30.159 --> 34:32.321
So should we do this?

34:32.829 --> 34:33.853
Absolutely.

34:34.297 --> 34:36.197
Okay, and, um, when you see me?

34:36.366 --> 34:37.389
Act surprised.

34:39.168 --> 34:42.866
All right, let's rock 'n' roll, people.
We're having a wedding.

34:43.907 --> 34:44.965
Salem, what do you think?

34:45.141 --> 34:48.132
I think we still need to have
"the talk. "

34:48.311 --> 34:51.712
Sabrina,
when a young woman enters...

34:51.880 --> 34:55.612
Um, would you mind
if we gave Zelda the aisle?

34:55.784 --> 34:57.184
Although at family gatherings

34:57.353 --> 35:00.686
I don't want there to be anything
between me and the exit.

35:02.458 --> 35:04.255
I'll let you know if you miss anything.

35:13.703 --> 35:17.537
<i>I love you truly</i>

35:19.175 --> 35:20.267
<i>- ly</i>

35:20.443 --> 35:22.001
Ah, there it is.

35:22.946 --> 35:23.970
<i>I love you truly</i>

35:24.147 --> 35:25.774
Okay, one blue toenail.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.780
Five dollars I borrowed
from the flower girl.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.713
Calm down, you'll get it back.

35:31.888 --> 35:34.857
New phone number from the best man.
And I'm gonna need that back.

35:35.024 --> 35:37.151
And this bracelet that I grabbed
from your jewelry box,

35:37.327 --> 35:39.693
which makes it old and stolen.

35:40.763 --> 35:42.890
There,
and I think you're ready to go.

35:43.066 --> 35:44.624
Oh, you look so beautiful.

35:44.801 --> 35:48.760
Oh, thanks,
I wasn't sure about the color, but...

35:48.938 --> 35:51.065
Oh, I can't believe this is it.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.409
<i>I love</i>

35:54.577 --> 35:57.842
- Wait, where's Amanda?
- Hey. Oh, sorry I'm late.

35:58.014 --> 35:59.504
I had some business to take care of.

36:00.883 --> 36:02.942
Don't worry.
You're too old to understand.

36:07.223 --> 36:11.250
<i>By your side to stand</i>

36:25.508 --> 36:29.308
<i>Ah, love, 'tis something</i>

36:30.480 --> 36:35.941
Listen, don't get all weepy on me,
but I got you a little something.

36:36.119 --> 36:39.782
Oh, that is so sweet.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.292
Salem, cash?

36:43.459 --> 36:44.949
Mm-hm.

36:45.128 --> 36:48.291
Sixteenth birthday, 17th birthday...

36:48.464 --> 36:50.694
Salem, you've been stealing
my birthday card money

36:50.867 --> 36:52.459
all these years?

36:52.635 --> 36:55.536
And I promised myself
I wasn't gonna cry.

36:58.207 --> 37:00.072
Anybody looking for a father
of the bride?

37:00.243 --> 37:02.143
Dad, I can't believe you made it.

37:02.312 --> 37:05.076
I'm sorry I'm late, but there
was a little flying monkey uprising

37:05.248 --> 37:06.806
and I had to pour some water on.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.046
Well,
it sounds like you're right on time.

37:10.219 --> 37:12.744
- Shall we?
- We shall.

37:17.126 --> 37:18.150
Oh. Oh, my God.

37:18.328 --> 37:19.886
Wait. Wait.

37:20.063 --> 37:22.054
I can't wear this.
Get it off me, hurry.

37:23.633 --> 37:24.895
Twelve thirty-six?

37:25.068 --> 37:27.161
Oh, Harvey gave me that
seven years ago.

37:27.337 --> 37:30.329
Twelve thirty-six
is the exact time that we met.

37:33.443 --> 37:35.536
I told you to go
before the ceremony started.

37:35.712 --> 37:36.872
Psst. Psst.

37:37.046 --> 37:38.877
- What?
- What?

37:39.048 --> 37:40.447
What?

37:40.616 --> 37:42.550
Psst. Down here.
- Huh? Oh.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.209
Hey, Sabrina. What are you doing?

37:44.387 --> 37:45.513
What in the world?

37:45.688 --> 37:47.781
Crisis. I really need
to talk to you guys back here.

37:47.957 --> 37:49.720
I mean back there.
I'm kind of turned around...

37:49.892 --> 37:52.156
Oh, I need to talk to you.

37:52.929 --> 37:54.362
Let's go.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.533
Let's go.

38:00.036 --> 38:02.436
I'm gonna need you
to write down that number again.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.041
I'll be right back. Try and stall.

38:06.209 --> 38:07.540
Maybe no one will notice.

38:26.779 --> 38:29.077
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm just not following.

38:29.249 --> 38:30.648
The stones don't fit together.

38:30.817 --> 38:32.785
That means our soul mates
are still out there.

38:32.952 --> 38:34.817
- Doubt was in my room this morning.
- Doubt?

38:34.988 --> 38:36.421
Oh, annoying little man.

38:37.557 --> 38:38.581
But such a good dancer.

38:38.758 --> 38:40.783
And even before today,
it's just been so hard.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.690
I mean, the circus showed up,
there was no room for him in heart,

38:43.863 --> 38:45.558
and he got turned into a gold fish.

38:45.732 --> 38:47.393
Sounds like a normal courtship to me.

38:47.567 --> 38:50.798
- Why is the universe so against me?
- Well, the answer to this is simple.

38:50.970 --> 38:52.995
- No more.
- No more what, no more?

38:53.172 --> 38:57.404
Magic. So two pieces of glowing coal
don't fit together. Who cares?

38:57.577 --> 38:59.340
What matters is
what's in your heart.

38:59.512 --> 39:01.605
No magic can tell you that.

39:01.781 --> 39:03.180
Sabrina, your mother's right.

39:03.349 --> 39:05.874
The universe isn't against
this wedding, you are.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.213
You've gotta stop all the pointing
and incanting,

39:08.388 --> 39:10.015
and listen to what your heart
is telling you.

39:10.189 --> 39:11.383
- But...
- No buts.

39:11.557 --> 39:13.047
Life doesn't have any guarantees.

39:13.226 --> 39:16.127
All you can do
is try to make each other happy.

39:16.296 --> 39:18.662
That's the same thing
that Aaron said.

39:18.831 --> 39:22.232
Well, he sounds like
a very smart young man.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.461
And, Sabrina,
no matter what you decide to do,

39:24.637 --> 39:25.865
it's not the end of the world.

39:26.039 --> 39:27.870
Believe me,
I've been to the end of the world.

39:28.041 --> 39:29.668
This isn't it.

39:29.876 --> 39:32.538
You two are the best.

39:32.712 --> 39:35.237
All right, go tell everyone
I'll be there in two minutes.

39:35.415 --> 39:37.542
And this time, I mean it.

39:43.323 --> 39:47.692
<i>Good times and bum times
I've seen it all and, my dear</i>

39:48.895 --> 39:51.295
<i>I'm still here</i>

39:51.464 --> 39:52.658
Mother.

39:52.832 --> 39:55.892
<i>I've run the gamut A to Z</i>

39:56.069 --> 39:59.527
<i>Three cheers
And damn it, c'est la vie</i>

39:59.706 --> 40:01.139
Mother!

40:31.571 --> 40:34.699
So if there are no objections?

40:42.382 --> 40:46.785
Curse the licoricey goodness
of good and plenty. No.

40:46.953 --> 40:49.444
Sabrina, if you'd like to begin.

40:50.490 --> 40:51.514
Okay.

40:53.159 --> 40:57.061
I, Sabrina, take you, Aaron Jacobs...

40:59.032 --> 41:01.398
Sorry. Uh, where was I?

41:01.567 --> 41:06.527
Oh, um, I, Sabrina Spellman,
take you, Aaron Jacobs,

41:06.706 --> 41:08.697
to be my partner in life.

41:08.875 --> 41:10.536
My one true...

41:12.111 --> 41:13.942
My one true...

41:15.782 --> 41:18.114
- My...
- Sabrina?

41:18.284 --> 41:20.115
Could we just have a minute?

41:22.188 --> 41:25.180
I just wanna talk over
some, uh, little...

41:25.358 --> 41:27.223
Okay. Do you mind?

41:33.466 --> 41:37.766
So I'm sensing
a little hesitation on your part.

41:38.471 --> 41:40.735
You are such a wonderful guy.

41:40.907 --> 41:42.067
But...

41:43.176 --> 41:45.542
We're not two halves of a whole.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.042
Sabrina,

41:51.150 --> 41:53.584
all I want is for you to be happy.

41:55.822 --> 41:57.312
But if we're not soul mates,

42:00.093 --> 42:01.651
maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

42:03.129 --> 42:06.530
- Aaron, I am so sorry.
- No, don't be.

42:09.001 --> 42:12.493
Never think that almost
is good enough for you.

42:12.939 --> 42:14.406
Or for you.

42:20.746 --> 42:23.146
Okay, well,
that about concludes today's festivities.

42:23.316 --> 42:26.774
Although I have 300 pounds of shrimp
across town you're all welcome to.

42:27.753 --> 42:30.745
So, um, thanks for coming.

42:52.178 --> 42:53.805
Harvey?

42:54.280 --> 42:55.747
I'm not really sure what this is,

42:55.915 --> 42:58.850
but something tells me
I'll find the answer here.

42:59.018 --> 43:01.578
And I think I just found mine.

43:14.100 --> 43:16.261
- It's about time.
It's about time.

43:16.435 --> 43:18.767
It's about time.

43:18.938 --> 43:20.405
I just said that.

43:29.815 --> 43:32.249
I guess that's the something old
she needed.

43:32.418 --> 43:33.680
Would you look at that?

43:33.853 --> 43:36.720
Twelve thirty-six on the dot.
