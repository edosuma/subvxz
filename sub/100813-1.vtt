you've all been waiting for.</i>

00:38.513 --> 00:41.150
<i>He is the king
of the high street.</i>

00:41.283 --> 00:45.287
<i>He's the Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart of retail.</i>

00:45.420 --> 00:48.256

<i>Sir Richard McCreadie!</i>

00:59.401 --> 01:01.636
<i>Thank you very much, Caroline.</i>

01:01.771 --> 01:05.474
<i>In that wonderful Monda dress,
you look knockout.</i>

01:05.607 --> 01:08.745
<i>When I was at school, my, uh,
schoolteacher used to read us</i>

01:08.878 --> 01:11.313
<i>a fairy tale
at the end of the day.</i>

01:11.446 --> 01:12.849
<i>And my favorite fairy tale was</i>

01:12.982 --> 01:14.851
<i>"The Goose That Laid
the Golden Egg."</i>

01:14.984 --> 01:16.618
<i>That's what Monda is to me.</i>

01:16.753 --> 01:18.620
<i>Monda is the golden goose,</i>

01:18.755 --> 01:21.423
<i>and I love the eggs
that it lays.</i>

01:21.556 --> 01:24.392
<i>Tonight, we're gonna reward
the shining stars. First up,</i>

01:24.526 --> 01:26.696
<i>Distribution Team Leader

01:26.829 --> 01:28.363
<i>and that is Amanda Conrad.</i>

01:29.999 --> 01:32.034
<i>Here's 10,000 pounds
for you to distribute.</i>

01:35.537 --> 01:36.773
<i>Lifetime Achievement Award</i>

01:36.906 --> 01:38.440
<i>goes to Philip Walker.</i>

01:40.910 --> 01:43.212

this one, to be honest.</i>

01:43.345 --> 01:46.215
<i>I'm sure you put a few hours

<i>Next is Buyer of the Year,</i>

01:47.917 --> 01:50.452
<i>for driving the hardest
bargains in the business.</i>

01:50.585 --> 01:52.221
<i>Glad I don't have
to deal with him.</i>

01:52.354 --> 01:54.223
<i>Good friend of mine,
Michael Harris.</i>

01:56.525 --> 01:59.561
<i>Well done. Well done.
Here you go.</i>

01:59.695 --> 02:03.065
<i>This year, I'm delighted
to announce</i>

02:03.298 --> 02:06.235
<i>that Monda have paid out
the biggest dividend</i>

02:06.368 --> 02:08.871
<i>that any private company
has ever paid.</i>

02:09.005 --> 02:13.676
<i>One-point-two billion pounds
to be paid to our owner</i>

02:13.810 --> 02:17.312
<i>and my very own
billion-dollar babe, Samantha.</i>

02:19.749 --> 02:22.218
<i>Um, wow, that is
a really big check.</i>

02:22.350 --> 02:24.220
<i>I don't know what to do
with all those zeros.</i>

02:24.352 --> 02:26.388
<i>But, um, I feel like
we've earned it,</i>

02:26.521 --> 02:29.859
<i>so thank you so much to Rich,
and thank you to everybody.</i>

02:29.992 --> 02:32.327
<i>You guys, you know,
you've all worked so hard,</i>

02:32.460 --> 02:34.797
<i>and this is for all of you.</i>

02:34.931 --> 02:39.302
<i>I mean... No, not literally,
but I mean, thank you.</i>

03:03.860 --> 03:05.427
Thank you.

03:07.763 --> 03:08.831
What a mess.

03:08.965 --> 03:12.268
Why did he need to build
an amphitheater?

03:12.400 --> 03:15.104
It was a crazy idea.
Too ambitious.

03:15.338 --> 03:18.373
"My name is Ozymandias,
king of kings:

03:18.506 --> 03:22.477
Look on my works,
ye Mighty, and despair!"

03:22.611 --> 03:26.015
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

03:30.887 --> 03:33.155
On Friday night
for the welcoming drinks,

03:33.388 --> 03:35.590
we are at the Jackie O' Bar.
Nice and informal.

03:35.725 --> 03:38.393
That's where Pixie Lott and
Fatboy Slim will be playing.

03:38.526 --> 03:40.428
- Oh, great. Yeah.
- Yeah. Um, on Saturday,

03:40.562 --> 03:42.164
we're going
to bring the grand piano

03:42.397 --> 03:44.399
to the Oasis Pool for Elton.

03:44.532 --> 03:47.837
Then Sunday daytime
we're going to go to the arena

03:47.970 --> 03:49.305
for the gladiator games,

03:49.437 --> 03:50.940
- as you requested.
- Yay!

03:51.073 --> 03:54.377
And Sunday night,
down by the beach, Coldplay.

04:01.951 --> 04:03.686
What's he saying?

04:05.388 --> 04:06.923
Why are you shrugging?
What's he saying?

04:07.056 --> 04:08.590
- Don't know.
- You don't know? Why?

04:08.724 --> 04:10.927
He's Bulgarian. I'm Greek.

04:11.060 --> 04:12.560
- You don't understand it?
- No.

04:12.695 --> 04:15.630
Fucking hell, Giannis, man!

04:15.765 --> 04:18.034
There is more than one type
of foreign language.

04:18.166 --> 04:21.370
I know that. I'm not an idiot.
Why are you hiring Bulgarians?

04:21.503 --> 04:23.739
They're cheap. That's why.

04:23.873 --> 04:25.975
It's slow, Giannis.
The whole lot.

04:26.108 --> 04:27.910
They never made
an amphitheater before.

04:28.044 --> 04:30.913
Yeah, I've never made an
amphitheater before, obviously.

04:32.081 --> 04:33.349
This our main beach.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.582
Yeah.

04:36.686 --> 04:38.120
Nice.

04:39.621 --> 04:40.923
Who are they?

04:41.057 --> 04:42.358
They... They are camping.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.492
What is it, Duke of Edinburgh?

04:44.626 --> 04:47.964
- Syrian refugees.
- Poor things.

04:48.097 --> 04:50.565
They've come a long way.
They won't mind going further.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.567
- Rich.
- What?

04:52.702 --> 04:53.668
They're refugees.

04:53.803 --> 04:55.805
They can find refuge somewhere

04:55.938 --> 04:58.908
that isn't smack bang in
the middle of our fucking view.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.609
In Greece, all beaches
are public.

05:01.744 --> 05:03.511
It's not me. It's my guests.

05:03.645 --> 05:05.748
Some of them are
very superficial.

05:09.651 --> 05:12.088
It's just, all I can see
is plywood, mate.

05:12.221 --> 05:14.924
I'm really anxious.
This is... It's not finished.

05:15.057 --> 05:17.393
Don't worry.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

05:17.559 --> 05:20.096
Yeah, but this is... This is
a tiny little bit of Rome,

05:20.229 --> 05:21.731
and you've had 10 days.

05:21.864 --> 05:24.266
We could make a virtue of it
being half built.

05:24.499 --> 05:26.035
The ruins
of an ancient amphitheater.

05:26.168 --> 05:27.703
No. No ruins.

05:27.837 --> 05:29.571
No ruins. Melanie, tell him why.

05:29.705 --> 05:32.274
One photo,
and it's an easy tabloid headline.

05:32.507 --> 05:35.444
The end of an empire.
Fiddling while Rome burns.

05:35.577 --> 05:37.645
- Handing it to them on a plate.
- I know.

05:37.780 --> 05:39.415
They're already
like flies on shit.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.784
Sorry. I am joking.
It will be finished.

05:41.917 --> 05:43.953
Actually, Rich, from this angle,
it looks very...

05:44.086 --> 05:45.921
- It's very imperial.
- Ohh...

05:46.055 --> 05:50.126
Those who are about to die
salute you.

05:53.628 --> 05:55.563
Go on, then. Die.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.769
I'm dying.

05:59.902 --> 06:03.973
Nah, you can die better than
that. Die again, but better.

06:09.611 --> 06:11.313
I'm dying.

06:21.690 --> 06:24.093
What's wrong with him?
Looks like a rescue cat

06:24.226 --> 06:25.828
that needs to be put down.

06:25.961 --> 06:28.097
I warned you,
they don't like being moved.

06:28.230 --> 06:29.932
It takes time
for them to settle.

06:30.066 --> 06:32.634
We've not brought him
to go on a yoga retreat.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.104
- He's supposed to be scary.
- When did you get here?

06:35.237 --> 06:37.173
Last week.
All this banging and clattering

06:37.306 --> 06:39.308
isn't helping, all right?

06:39.542 --> 06:41.143
What is this?

06:41.277 --> 06:43.946
- It's...
- It's like some sort of prison.

06:44.080 --> 06:47.049
We need something to pep him
up a bit. Some cocaine.

06:47.183 --> 06:50.352
The kitchen staff have some.
I was told.

06:50.585 --> 06:52.154
What he needs is a sedative,
if anything.

06:52.288 --> 06:54.824
- Mum!
- Oh, Nanny's here now.

06:54.957 --> 06:58.660
- She's still alive.
- Come here. Come here.

06:58.794 --> 07:01.564
- Ah, Ricky.
- Ah! All right, Finn.

07:01.697 --> 07:04.834
- Hi, Dad. Yeah, go on.
- Where's your big brother?

07:04.967 --> 07:06.502
Adrian's busy working.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.071
- He works too hard.
- He'll be here on the night.

07:09.205 --> 07:10.940
- He's a grafter, like his dad.
- Yeah.

07:11.073 --> 07:13.608
- Why have you got the lion?
- It's for the gladiator games.

07:13.742 --> 07:15.744
We're recreating <i>Gladiator,</i>
like we used to.

07:15.878 --> 07:17.813
It was tigers, not lions,
in <i>Gladiator.</i>

07:17.947 --> 07:19.849
That film was littered
with inaccuracies.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.584
Don't get me started
on <i>Gladiator.</i>

07:21.717 --> 07:23.552
We want it to be authentic.

07:23.686 --> 07:26.654
- What's his name?
- Clarence.

07:26.789 --> 07:28.157
Hiya.

07:31.827 --> 07:32.928
Schoolboy error.

07:33.062 --> 07:34.730
Never ever show fear to a lion.

07:34.864 --> 07:36.532
Lions can smell fear.

07:36.664 --> 07:39.568
I'm like that. I can smell fear.

07:39.702 --> 07:43.172
What you doing lurking around
like a tabloid hack?

07:43.305 --> 07:46.075
Uh, I'm Nick, the writer.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.177
- Your biographer.
- Yeah, I know <i>who</i> you are.

07:48.310 --> 07:50.546
I was asking
what the fuck you're doing.

07:50.679 --> 07:54.416
Rich, don't frighten Nick.
He's on your side.

07:54.649 --> 07:58.754
Thank you, Sir Richard,
for appearing before us today.

07:58.888 --> 08:00.556
I wasn't aware I had a choice.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.993
Retail fashion is
a huge global industry.

08:04.126 --> 08:05.461
In the UK alone, it's worth

08:05.694 --> 08:08.764
an estimated
60 billion pounds annually.

08:08.898 --> 08:12.034
The owner of H&M is
the richest man in Sweden.

08:12.168 --> 08:14.669
The owner of Zara is one of
the richest men in the world.

08:14.803 --> 08:16.605
You are Britain's equivalent.

08:16.739 --> 08:18.941
Famous for owning
several high-street brands,

08:19.074 --> 08:22.111
including Monda
and of course M&J.

08:22.244 --> 08:26.081
Last year, M&J went bankrupt
with the loss of 11,000 jobs.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.851
- A lot of those were part-time.
- You've been described

08:28.984 --> 08:31.854
as the unacceptable face
of capitalism. Is that fair?

08:31.987 --> 08:33.789
Have you taken a look
in the mirror?

08:35.323 --> 08:38.594
You've been described
as, uh, "Sir Greedy,"

08:38.760 --> 08:41.597
uh, "Sir Shifty,"

08:41.730 --> 08:43.164
"Greedy McCreadie."

08:43.299 --> 08:46.101
Been calls for you to be
stripped of your knighthood.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.070
Sir Richard,
what would you say to that?

08:48.204 --> 08:50.639
Envy and jealousy,
my doctor tells me,

08:50.773 --> 08:55.010
are incurable diseases.
I've done nothing wrong.

08:55.144 --> 08:56.912
Yes, you have.

08:57.046 --> 08:59.114
- Get off him, you bitch!
- Disgusting man.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.617
Do you know what you've...?
Get off!

09:01.750 --> 09:04.954
<i>I hate those shites that
try to embarrass my son in public.</i>

09:05.087 --> 09:06.722
- Scum of the earth.
- Where is my job?

09:06.855 --> 09:09.158
- Opportunistic bitch.
- Where are our jobs?

09:09.291 --> 09:11.193
How old are you, Nick?

09:11.327 --> 09:13.629
- I'm 44.
- Mm, you look...

09:13.762 --> 09:16.131
- You look half that.
- Oh, thank you very much.

09:16.265 --> 09:20.803
You have very pale skin.
Like a baby.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.104
Um, ahem, so...

09:22.238 --> 09:26.275
- So you are writing Ricky's book?
- That's right.

09:26.408 --> 09:29.111
If you're gonna write something,
make sure it's good.

09:29.245 --> 09:31.780
- Well, I'll try.
- No, you can't try.

09:31.914 --> 09:33.082
You gotta be able to do it.

09:33.215 --> 09:34.917
You either do it
or you can't do it.

09:35.050 --> 09:36.785
Can you write the book, Nick?

09:36.919 --> 09:38.454
Uh, yes. Yes, I can.

09:38.722 --> 09:39.922
- Is that a "yes" I heard?
- Yes.

09:40.055 --> 09:42.091
Yes, that's fine.

09:42.224 --> 09:45.160
My son Ricky,
he pretends that he's...

09:45.294 --> 09:47.029
He's... You know,
he's cocky and loud

09:47.162 --> 09:49.131
and all of that stuff,
but he isn't really.

09:49.265 --> 09:51.300
He's very sensitive,
very, very shy.

09:51.433 --> 09:54.370
Very shy little boy, he was,
when he was at school, you know.

09:54.503 --> 09:56.272
<i>Much more sensitive
than people think.</i>

09:56.405 --> 09:58.742
<i>You know, he hides it
with all his bluster.</i>

09:58.874 --> 10:01.711
Roll up for the amazing
Señor Ricardo, aka Tricky Dicky.

10:01.844 --> 10:04.813
Have you got a coin, Lewis, that
I could borrow for this trick?

10:04.947 --> 10:07.983
Thank you very much.
Oh, we have 50 English pence.

10:08.117 --> 10:09.785
Big spender.
Now, watch carefully.

10:09.918 --> 10:12.554
Well, as carefully as you can
with your rubbish eyes,

10:12.788 --> 10:14.724
as I make your coin...

10:14.857 --> 10:16.058
disappear.

10:16.191 --> 10:17.259
- Yeah!
- Watch again

10:17.393 --> 10:18.861
as I weave another spell,

10:18.994 --> 10:20.562
make it come back. You ready?

10:21.864 --> 10:23.198
You're up, Greedy.

10:23.332 --> 10:24.900
Ah, shit. Sorry, Lewis.

10:25.034 --> 10:26.402
I guess
your coin's gone forever.

10:26.535 --> 10:29.238
- Hey, that was my 50p.
- It's vanished into the ether.

10:29.371 --> 10:32.975
There's a very fine line
between magic and tragic.

10:33.108 --> 10:36.746
Always makes me laugh how
everyone always thinks of him

10:36.879 --> 10:40.316
as this sort of barrow boy, just
because he left school at 16,

10:40.449 --> 10:43.152
but, heh, it was
a private school.

10:43.285 --> 10:45.722
You know? And the two of us,
we hated it.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.856
Run, McCreadie!

10:47.990 --> 10:50.125
- Can't.
- No such word as "can't."

10:50.259 --> 10:52.928
Yes, there is, sir.
It's what the others call you.

10:53.062 --> 10:56.198
At least it sounds like "can't."

10:59.034 --> 11:00.035
Out.

11:00.169 --> 11:01.738
When you've changed,

11:01.870 --> 11:03.539
you can go
to the headmaster's office.

11:09.244 --> 11:11.213
Stop, sir. Stop, please.

11:12.848 --> 11:14.983
Why, McCreadie?

11:15.117 --> 11:17.086
You're tickling me, sir.

11:20.189 --> 11:23.392
- Greedy!
- You can fuck off.

11:23.525 --> 11:25.829
Things definitely got worse
when his dad died.

11:25.994 --> 11:29.198
I mean, it was like school
was some prison for him.

11:29.331 --> 11:30.265
<i>He was just...</i>

11:31.934 --> 11:34.536
<i>...you know,
waiting to bust out.</i>

11:36.372 --> 11:39.408
- We might have to sell the house.
- No. I can leave school.

11:39.541 --> 11:42.378
Use the money you spend on the
fees to pay for the mortgage.

11:42.511 --> 11:45.147
Your daddy wanted you
to have an education.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.850
He believed in education.

11:46.982 --> 11:51.053
He's not here now, is he?
He's in the car in front.

11:51.186 --> 11:53.355
I want you to be a success.

11:53.489 --> 11:55.924
I want you to go
to Oxford or Cambridge.

11:56.058 --> 11:58.660
I want you to be able to do
whatever you want to do.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.062
And I just wanna make money

12:00.195 --> 12:02.030
so I can do
whatever I want to do.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.468
<i>How did he get
the nickname "Greedy"?</i>

12:06.602 --> 12:08.303
<i>Greedy McCreadie.</i>

12:08.437 --> 12:09.873
<i>I mean, he chose the name.</i>

12:10.005 --> 12:11.073
<i>It was his gambling name.</i>

12:11.206 --> 12:12.941
- Ladies, Lewis.
- Piss off.

12:13.075 --> 12:15.477
- Right, <i>faites vos jeux.</i>
- What does that mean?

12:15.611 --> 12:18.113
It's French for
"place your fucking bets."

12:18.247 --> 12:20.249
<i>Cards was his thing.
Even back then,</i>

12:20.382 --> 12:23.352
<i>it was about gambling,
it was about making money.</i>

12:23.485 --> 12:24.453
Who's gonna get it?

12:27.156 --> 12:29.425
Okay, here we go.

12:29.558 --> 12:31.994
Oh, has he gone bust?
Ah, yes, he has.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.962
That's all mine.
Thank you very much.

12:34.096 --> 12:36.699
- McCreadie. Gambling?
- Lewis, thank you.

12:36.932 --> 12:38.500
How can it be gambling
when I always win?

12:38.634 --> 12:40.035
It is more like robbery.

12:40.169 --> 12:41.937
- Hand it over.
- Sir, what are you doing?

12:42.070 --> 12:43.939
Sir, no, no, no, no!
Sir, I'm the banker!

12:44.072 --> 12:45.875
- It is against school rules.
- It's my money.

12:46.008 --> 12:47.710
- No, this is mine.
- I'm confiscating it.

12:47.943 --> 12:49.879
What are you gonna do with it?
Buy a toothbrush?

12:50.012 --> 12:53.382
I'm gonna pay it to your mother
and watch her dance.

12:55.919 --> 12:58.922
I'm afraid at this school,
we expect the highest standards

12:59.054 --> 13:00.924
of behavior and achievement.

13:01.056 --> 13:03.927
Is that why you hit children?
Is that your high standard?

13:04.059 --> 13:06.161
Corporal punishment
is a necessary evil...

13:06.295 --> 13:10.165
You're an unnecessary evil, hm?

13:10.299 --> 13:11.868
Ricky,
let's get out of here.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.403
We don't need these people.
We don't need this school.

13:14.536 --> 13:17.306
I know your sort. You're
the sort that used to put up

13:17.439 --> 13:20.976
"no Irish, no blacks,
no dogs" signs, hm?

13:21.109 --> 13:23.746
I met plenty of people like you
when I came to London.

13:23.979 --> 13:26.348
Now look at me.
Take a good look.

13:26.482 --> 13:29.017
I've got much more money
than most of them have

13:29.151 --> 13:32.689
and a bloody sight
more than you.

13:36.124 --> 13:37.961
<i>Bye.</i>

13:39.394 --> 13:40.529
Goodbye, Mrs. McCreadie.

13:40.662 --> 13:43.432
The mother is worse
than the son.

13:43.565 --> 13:46.401
Bloody stuck-up English gits.

13:46.535 --> 13:49.271
- We're gonna show them.
- We are gonna be fine, Ricky.

13:49.404 --> 13:51.039
We'll be more than fine.

13:51.173 --> 13:53.041
Fuck them.

13:53.175 --> 13:54.944
Fuck all of them.

13:59.181 --> 14:02.551
- One more time. One more time.
- Oh, no, no.

14:02.685 --> 14:04.253
- Got it.
- It's simple.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.188
You know it's simple.
Follow the queen.

14:06.321 --> 14:07.456
Mm-hm.

14:08.524 --> 14:11.460
Watch... the... queen.

14:11.593 --> 14:13.428
Follow her like a corgi
humping her leg.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.398
- Right, Eric, where's the queen?
- Heh-heh. Hm...

14:16.532 --> 14:18.233
That one?

14:18.367 --> 14:20.536
Balls. Every time.
I don't know how you do it.

14:20.669 --> 14:22.104
- Eric!
- Come on, give me a fiver.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.505
I've gotta go see my supplier.

14:23.639 --> 14:25.307
- Drug supplier?
- I don't need drugs.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.276
I am fucking drugs.

14:44.359 --> 14:47.095
He didn't need a mentor.

14:47.229 --> 14:49.331
He was his own man
from the start.

14:49.464 --> 14:51.533
He had an instinct, a talent.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.037
What do you want
for this lot?

14:54.169 --> 14:56.405

shake my hand and kiss my arse.

14:59.374 --> 15:01.176

15:01.310 --> 15:03.312
- Four grand.

15:03.445 --> 15:06.114
Yeah, 500 items of shit.
I'll give you 4 grand.

15:06.248 --> 15:09.052
- You just gonna keep saying 4?
- I can say 3 if you like. Three.

15:09.184 --> 15:12.487
- I can't do 4.
- Right. I've heard enough.

- Okay. No. No, no.

21:07.877 --> 21:11.414
Lily, you're doing great.
Fabian, buck the fuck up, mate.

21:11.546 --> 21:13.349
- Right. Um...
- Please tell him his line.

21:13.481 --> 21:16.052
- Do you know what the line is?
- Obviously not.

21:16.185 --> 21:18.921
Okay. Uh, all right, so, um...

21:19.055 --> 21:23.993
It's "Maybe I'm not the person
you thought I was." Yeah?

21:24.126 --> 21:26.661
- Okay. I gotcha.
- Yeah? Brilliant.

21:26.796 --> 21:28.230
Okay.

21:30.199 --> 21:32.534
Okay.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.203
- All right, turning?
- Yeah, speeding.

21:34.437 --> 21:36.839
Okay. Excellent. Action!

21:36.973 --> 21:39.008
I know I screwed up,

21:39.141 --> 21:41.811
but maybe I'm not the person
I thought I am.

21:41.944 --> 21:43.611
- Oh, Christ!
- Sorry. Maybe...

21:55.458 --> 21:57.659
Giannis!

21:57.793 --> 21:59.527
- Hello?
- What's happening?

21:59.661 --> 22:00.863
You like it?

22:00.997 --> 22:02.765
Have you looked at the plans?

22:02.898 --> 22:05.001
What's going in the gap?

22:05.134 --> 22:07.569
I don't know.
I thought it's on the drawing.

22:07.703 --> 22:09.438
It is not on the drawings!

22:09.571 --> 22:12.041
This is not on the drawings,
what I'm looking at here.

22:12.174 --> 22:15.845
Arch, gap, arch is not
on the drawings.

22:15.978 --> 22:18.114
He's gonna fucking crucify me!

22:18.247 --> 22:20.582
Could be part
of the games, maybe.

22:22.251 --> 22:24.954
Very funny, Giannis.

22:25.087 --> 22:27.655
Fortunately, I don't think
you've got the wherewithal

22:27.790 --> 22:30.026
to make a workable
fucking cross!

22:31.626 --> 22:34.163
What's wrong, Lily?
Tell me all about it.

22:35.765 --> 22:37.700
It's just Fabian.

22:39.101 --> 22:40.803
We're going through
a bit of a...

22:40.936 --> 22:45.741
A bit of a rough patch,
and he makes me sad.

22:47.542 --> 22:49.311
I thought that was
just part of the show.

22:49.544 --> 22:51.814
For the TV, for the filming.

22:51.947 --> 22:54.016
You're really going out
with Fabian?

22:54.150 --> 22:55.684
- Yes.
- Oh!

22:57.019 --> 22:58.054
No.

22:59.522 --> 23:01.457
Oh, I don't know. I mean...

23:01.589 --> 23:03.591
I mean, it is scripted, but...

23:03.726 --> 23:06.896
Why are you crying?

23:07.029 --> 23:09.532
Well, it's method.

23:09.664 --> 23:13.803
We have to stay in character,
even off set.

23:13.936 --> 23:15.905
But you're playing
yourself, Lily.

23:16.038 --> 23:17.006
Think about it.

23:17.139 --> 23:18.974
You are your character.

23:20.543 --> 23:22.945
- I know. But...
- Yes. Mm-hm.

23:23.079 --> 23:25.281
I have to find myself.

23:26.816 --> 23:28.951
Which is harder than I thought.

23:29.085 --> 23:32.354
Excuse me. Do you know the way
to the Poseidon Terrace?

23:32.587 --> 23:34.857
Yeah, it's just...
Do you know what, I'll take you.

23:34.990 --> 23:37.159
Oh, thanks.
You're from England?

23:37.293 --> 23:39.728
- Yeah. Leicester.
- Leicester. Heh.

23:39.862 --> 23:42.832
- Do you follow the football?
- Uh... No.

23:42.965 --> 23:44.632
Me, neither. That's a relief.

23:44.767 --> 23:47.369
Because that's pretty much
all the footie chat I've got.

23:47.602 --> 23:49.338
On the other hand,
if you want to ask me

23:49.572 --> 23:51.507
about Richard III's body
being discovered

23:51.639 --> 23:53.843
in a car park
in Leicester, fire away.

23:53.976 --> 23:55.610
So he wants it to be epic.

23:55.744 --> 23:57.113
- Great.
- Fucking epic, to be exact.

23:57.246 --> 23:59.181
Fucking epic's my middle name.

23:59.315 --> 24:01.616
<i>The Great Gatsby</i>
meets <i>Gladiator</i>

24:01.750 --> 24:03.786
- meets <i>The Godfather.</i>
- Mm-hm.

24:03.919 --> 24:05.554
And other films
beginning with G.

24:05.688 --> 24:09.091
<i>Goodfellas, Gone with the Wind,</i>
um, <i>Grease.</i>

24:09.225 --> 24:10.192
Oh, hi. You all right?

24:10.326 --> 24:11.360
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:11.594 --> 24:12.728
Come join us. Have a seat.

24:12.862 --> 24:14.530
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you met Amanda.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.365
You should interview her
for your book.

24:16.599 --> 24:17.800
Oh, really? Why is that?

24:17.933 --> 24:19.969
She used to work for M&J
before it shut down.

24:20.102 --> 24:22.605
- In one of the shops.
- Now she works for me.

24:22.738 --> 24:24.740
Ah, so you're
part of the family.

24:24.874 --> 24:26.208
The McCreadie family.

24:26.342 --> 24:28.077
- Not really.
- If it's a family,

24:28.210 --> 24:29.378
it's a dysfunctional one.

24:29.612 --> 24:31.413
How long
have you been part of it?

24:31.646 --> 24:33.249
Since Samantha's
40th birthday party.

24:33.382 --> 24:35.718
What kind of budget
you thinking for the party?

24:35.851 --> 24:37.786
- Oh, whatever it takes.
- A million pounds.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.555
What? It's my 40th, babes.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.957
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

24:42.091 --> 24:44.059
For the whole party
or just the music?

24:44.193 --> 24:45.828
Well, what do we need?

24:45.961 --> 24:48.831
- Well, it depends who you like.
- Mm-hm. What about Elton?

24:48.964 --> 24:51.233
- John?
- Mm, there's only one Elton.

24:51.367 --> 24:53.435
That's doable.
We've used Elton a few times.

24:53.668 --> 24:54.737
- How much?
- How much?

24:54.870 --> 24:56.238
- He's a million to sing.
- Pounds?

24:56.372 --> 24:58.107
- Dollars.
- Well, it's not bad.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.142
His costs are on top
of that, obviously.

25:00.276 --> 25:02.011
- How much are they?
- He needs a jet,

25:02.144 --> 25:04.013
his tour manager,
his sound crew.

25:04.146 --> 25:06.248
- Mariah Carey, when she came...
- Oh, my God!

25:06.382 --> 25:08.184
I love Mariah Carey. Oh!

25:08.317 --> 25:10.219
- ...she brought all her dogs.
- She did?

25:10.352 --> 25:12.421
- Mm.
- How many dogs?

25:12.688 --> 25:14.823
- Quite a few.
- Hm.

25:14.957 --> 25:16.859
Mm, and Diana Ross,
when she came,

25:16.992 --> 25:19.228
she brought her whole family
for a 10-day holiday.

25:19.361 --> 25:21.463
Well, give an inch,
take a fucking mile.

25:21.697 --> 25:23.766
Yeah. Crazy.

25:23.899 --> 25:26.969
- What about Robbie Williams?
- He's a million.

25:27.102 --> 25:28.871
Robbie Williams is
the same as Elton?

25:29.004 --> 25:30.005
- Yeah.
- Got a fucking nerve.

25:31.140 --> 25:32.676
What about Shakira?

25:32.808 --> 25:36.212
What's...? What's her quote
looking like? Shakira.

25:36.345 --> 25:38.480
<i>Shakira? Around the same.</i>

25:38.714 --> 25:41.083
<i>Probably go up
to about 3 for a package.</i>

25:41.217 --> 25:43.118
- About 3 million for a package.
- What?

25:43.252 --> 25:45.154
- Are you fucking... Three million?
- Shakira?

25:45.287 --> 25:47.089
She doesn't even wear shoes
when she sings.

25:47.223 --> 25:49.825
Let's just, um, park Shakira
and Beyoncé for a moment.

25:49.959 --> 25:51.193
Have you got anything around...

25:51.327 --> 25:53.162
Imagine parking
Shakira and Beyoncé.

25:53.295 --> 25:55.231
- ...the half a million mark?
- There's a thought.

25:55.364 --> 25:57.266
- Hard to park Beyoncé.
- 500K?

25:57.399 --> 25:59.001
How much is Tom Jones?

25:59.134 --> 26:01.670
<i>Uh, He would be
around sort of 350.</i>

26:01.804 --> 26:02.871
- Three-fifty.
- That's it?

26:03.005 --> 26:04.673
- We can have Tom Jones!
- A bargain.

26:04.807 --> 26:05.941
We'll have two Tom Jones.

26:07.977 --> 26:10.714
And it's been
pretty full-time ever since.

26:10.846 --> 26:13.782
We've been working on this party
for over a year.

26:13.916 --> 26:16.318
- What's that Greek word?
- Taramosalata.

26:16.452 --> 26:19.021
- No, not any Greek word, moron.
- Hubris.

26:19.154 --> 26:20.222
- That's it.
- Yes, hubris.

26:20.356 --> 26:22.524
Pride comes before a fall.

26:22.758 --> 26:23.759
Aristotle said that.

26:23.892 --> 26:24.760
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:24.893 --> 26:26.128
I think it's Aesop, actually.

26:26.262 --> 26:27.997
- Do you?
- I've got the drive

26:28.130 --> 26:31.033
- with the happy birthdays.
- Oh, great. That's good.

26:31.166 --> 26:33.068
Ever since he got
hauled over the coals

26:33.202 --> 26:36.672
at the Select Committee,
he's just been obsessed with it.

26:36.805 --> 26:39.341
He wants it to repair his
reputational damage, you know.

26:39.475 --> 26:41.910
He wants it to show everyone
he's still the boss.

26:42.044 --> 26:45.814
Now, M&J isn't the first company
of yours to go bankrupt, is it?

26:45.948 --> 26:49.018
In 1977, you set up Harston.

26:49.151 --> 26:53.922
It closed with debts of 235,000
pounds and assets of 436.

26:54.056 --> 26:57.293
In 1981, you started JM Jeans.

26:57.426 --> 26:59.328
It was wound up
for not paying bills.

26:59.461 --> 27:01.830
So was Wincraft,
another of your companies.

27:01.964 --> 27:05.301
In 1995, you bought a chain
of department stores.

27:05.434 --> 27:07.536
Five years later,
that chain had disappeared

27:07.771 --> 27:10.005
from the high street.
Then there were the jewelers

27:10.139 --> 27:12.941
you bought off the bank when
you persuaded them to discount

27:13.075 --> 27:15.077
6 million pounds of debt
down to 3 million.

27:15.210 --> 27:16.578
They went into liquidation.

27:16.812 --> 27:18.213
I'm an entrepreneur.

27:18.347 --> 27:21.850
I take risks. Some you win,
some you don't.

27:21.984 --> 27:25.789
Well, indeed.
In 1990, you launched Xcellent.

27:25.921 --> 27:28.324
Um... Um, okay,
so I was thinking possibly...

27:28.457 --> 27:32.127
I was thinking
a natural oak for the back.

27:32.261 --> 27:34.830
If that's not
quite right, we've...

27:34.963 --> 27:37.767
A sort of darker walnut we have.

27:37.900 --> 27:42.806
That is the color of posh shit.

27:42.938 --> 27:44.873
- Okay. Um...
- What else you got?

27:45.007 --> 27:46.342
Well, we've got lots here.

27:46.475 --> 27:48.944
Uh, actually, a muted blue.

27:49.078 --> 27:51.280
Fuck muted. I don't want muted.

27:51.413 --> 27:53.215
Did Marcel Marceau ever sell

27:53.349 --> 27:55.417
a single pair
of black-and-white tights?

27:55.551 --> 27:58.387
No. I don't want muted.
I want noise.

27:58.520 --> 28:01.758
- I'm in the business of loud.
- Right.

28:01.890 --> 28:03.292
What's that?

28:03.425 --> 28:05.994
- That's fuchsia.
- Yeah, fuchsia.

28:06.128 --> 28:07.930
Fuchsia's a bit in-your-face.
That's...

28:08.063 --> 28:10.767
I want in-your-face.
I am in-your-fucking-face.

28:10.899 --> 28:12.301
Fuchsia. You're brand manager.

28:12.434 --> 28:14.970
You're supposed to understand
about interior design.

28:15.104 --> 28:17.841
You can't get more interior
than fuchsia.

28:17.973 --> 28:21.845
I mean, it's the actual color
of a twat, isn't it?

28:21.977 --> 28:23.847
I mean, that is
nature's interior design.

28:23.979 --> 28:26.382
It... It draws you in.
It's biology. It's...

28:26.515 --> 28:31.053
I mean, fuchsia's French
for "fuck me," isn't it?

28:31.186 --> 28:34.289
You know, it's funny, um,
hearing people refer to him

28:34.423 --> 28:37.025
as the king of the high street.
I mean...

28:37.159 --> 28:39.027
look at all those early shops
he bought.

28:39.161 --> 28:40.662
They were absolutely terrible.

28:40.929 --> 28:43.265
Oh, Christ on a bike, Neil.

28:43.399 --> 28:45.000
What am I gonna say about this?

28:45.134 --> 28:47.871
I don't... Well, I was hoping
you'd like it,

28:48.003 --> 28:50.906
but it doesn't sound like...

28:51.039 --> 28:53.843
- Is something wrong?
- Something's wrong. Yeah.

28:53.976 --> 28:57.312
Um, too many clothes?
Too few clothes, perhaps?

28:57.446 --> 28:59.248
Oh, shall I put you
out of your misery?

28:59.381 --> 29:00.382
- Yeah?
- Please.

29:00.516 --> 29:02.050
No, I'm not gonna do that.

29:02.184 --> 29:04.420
That'd involve me performing
a very late abortion.

29:04.553 --> 29:06.355
- Heh.
- Don't laugh. This is not banter.

29:06.488 --> 29:09.258
This is me bollocking you.
Can you not read people?

29:09.391 --> 29:11.393
No. Uh, yes, I can.

29:11.527 --> 29:13.429
You can't. Otherwise,
you'd stop talking.

29:13.562 --> 29:15.865
What else can't you read, Neil?

29:15.998 --> 29:20.035
You can't read the fucking name
of the fucking shop.

29:20.169 --> 29:23.105
It's white on white. In other
words, it's shite on shite.

29:23.238 --> 29:25.674
That is Page 1 of the manual,
isn't it?

29:25.909 --> 29:28.143
In fact, it's the front cover
of the fucking book.

29:28.277 --> 29:30.245
Name recognition.

29:31.180 --> 29:32.347
Yep.

29:32.481 --> 29:34.016
If you don't sort this out,

29:34.149 --> 29:36.151
the writing
is on the wall for you.

29:36.285 --> 29:39.321
Except it won't be white on
white. It'll be red on brown.

29:39.455 --> 29:41.957
You know what those colors
are for, Neil?

29:42.090 --> 29:45.994
Uh, is it blood and poo?

29:46.128 --> 29:48.530
Yeah, correct. Well done.
There's hope for you yet, Neil.

29:48.664 --> 29:51.701
This is positive reinforcement.
This is me motivating you.

29:51.935 --> 29:53.569
I want this window
to scream "Xcellent."

29:53.703 --> 29:56.305
If it doesn't scream "Xcellent,"
I'm gonna scream at you,

29:56.438 --> 29:58.240
except it won't be "Xcellent,"
will it?

29:58.373 --> 30:00.944
- No.
- No, it'll be the word "cunt."

30:01.076 --> 30:02.578
I'll be screaming it
so fucking loud

30:02.712 --> 30:06.081
that it will melt that misshapen
slab of Spam you call a face,

30:06.215 --> 30:09.051
and then I'll put you in there
and use you as a mannequin.

30:09.184 --> 30:11.320
At least then you'll be
some fucking use to me.

30:11.453 --> 30:13.021
- Yeah.
- And remember,

30:13.155 --> 30:14.924
mannequins don't have cocks,
do they?

30:15.057 --> 30:16.124
No, they don't.

30:16.258 --> 30:18.895
- What do they have instead?
- I suppose

30:19.027 --> 30:22.264
- sort of smooth bumps, really.
- Smooth bumps. Right.

30:22.397 --> 30:25.033
So if you don't wanna swap
your cock for a smooth bump,

30:25.167 --> 30:26.602
what are you gonna do?

30:28.337 --> 30:29.238
Sort this out?

30:29.371 --> 30:30.439
- Yeah, sort this out.
- Yeah.

30:30.572 --> 30:32.207
All right. Cheers.

30:32.341 --> 30:36.946
Xcellent went bankrupt
with 13 million pounds of debt.

30:37.079 --> 30:39.081
You've got
burnt orange next to red.

30:39.214 --> 30:41.951
I mean, that's just...
It clashes.

30:44.988 --> 30:48.023
Whose fucking idea
was fucking fuchsia?

30:49.759 --> 30:52.094
Don't know
what you're fucking laughing at.

30:52.227 --> 30:54.196
Giving me a fucking migraine.

30:54.329 --> 30:56.231
Oh, Christ, it...

30:56.365 --> 30:59.936
It's like being trapped
inside a-a-a giant vagina

31:00.068 --> 31:02.204
full of discount clothes.

31:02.337 --> 31:05.574
Thought these
would have sold well.

31:05.708 --> 31:07.476
I think I need them.

31:07.609 --> 31:09.946
Oh, that's better.

31:10.078 --> 31:12.381
- Where's Neil?
- He's off with his nerves.

31:12.514 --> 31:15.384
"Off with his nerves."
Off with his fucking head.

31:17.586 --> 31:20.322
I'm gonna tell you something,
but please don't freak out.

31:20.455 --> 31:22.591
That'll have the opposite
effect, saying that.

31:22.725 --> 31:24.626
- Then freak out, if you want.
- Spit it out.

31:24.761 --> 31:26.528
Our A-listers are dropping
like flies.

31:26.662 --> 31:27.997
- What?
- They're not coming.

31:28.163 --> 31:29.832
That's the point,
to make us look good.

31:30.065 --> 31:31.600
- I know, I know.
- What about Leo?

31:31.734 --> 31:33.101
He says he's got a shoot.

31:33.235 --> 31:35.504
Some fucking PR pixie's
bent his ear.

31:35.637 --> 31:38.106
- Fucking bear-shagging twat.
- Hi.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.608
- My friend, money.
- Sorry.

31:39.742 --> 31:41.811
- I haven't got any, all right?
- Money, money!

31:42.045 --> 31:43.312
I'm wearing swimming shorts.

31:43.445 --> 31:46.515
Where am I gonna hide money?
Up me arsehole?

31:46.648 --> 31:49.351
Wait. Why don't we
tell them about the refugees

31:49.484 --> 31:52.421
and turn the Coldplay gig
into a benefit?

31:58.695 --> 32:00.462
What are you doing, Giannis?

32:02.264 --> 32:03.632
Giannis?

32:03.766 --> 32:06.268
- We're tying it down.
- Why?

32:06.401 --> 32:08.370
It's getting very windy.

32:08.503 --> 32:11.007
Maybe could blows it away.

32:11.139 --> 32:13.208
It's a windy island.
What we can do?

32:13.342 --> 32:14.610
Yep.

32:14.744 --> 32:17.379
Mykonos is very famous
for the wind.

32:17.512 --> 32:18.715
Yeah.

32:20.415 --> 32:22.685
- This is your young man, huh?
- Yes, this is Francois.

32:22.819 --> 32:24.519
Hello. I'm very happy
to meet you.

32:24.653 --> 32:26.321
The pleasure's all mine,
Francoise.

32:26.455 --> 32:29.092
No, it's Francois.
Otherwise, I would be a girl.

32:29.224 --> 32:30.258
- Ha-ha!
- Get it right, Mum.

32:30.392 --> 32:31.861
Where are the children?

32:32.095 --> 32:33.295
Finn sleeps all day.

32:33.428 --> 32:35.297
He's pale.
He looks like a vampire.

32:35.430 --> 32:38.166
Lily was here, but she's off
with the reality TV show.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.235
Oh, what's that about?
Why would you want

32:40.369 --> 32:42.471
your life splashed
all over the telly, Francoise?

32:42.604 --> 32:44.439
- Beats me.
- It's good for her.

32:44.573 --> 32:46.642
It gives her something to do,
keeps her grounded.

32:46.776 --> 32:48.276
- Keeps her grounded?
- Yeah. Yeah.

32:48.410 --> 32:49.679
Look at the Kardashians.

32:49.812 --> 32:52.214
Kylie Jenner's got
a billion Instagram followers.

32:52.347 --> 32:54.549
- She's on the cover of <i>Forbes.</i>
- Well, she must be

32:54.684 --> 32:56.284
a very good person,
very successful...

32:56.418 --> 32:58.186
She's richer than you, sweetie.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.422
- She's worth a lot. Yes.
- That's not true, is it?

33:00.555 --> 33:01.758
- It's true.
- Can't be true.

33:01.891 --> 33:03.592
She's richer than you.

33:03.726 --> 33:06.129
Is that a push-up bra,
or are they new?

33:06.261 --> 33:09.699
Are those teeth fake? Put them
in the glass. Take them out.

33:09.832 --> 33:12.501
- Yeah, they cost 20 grand.
- Well, these cost 10K.

33:12.634 --> 33:15.071
Where'd you get those from?
Discount Tits R Us?

33:15.203 --> 33:17.106
You haven't seen them.
They're amazing.

33:17.239 --> 33:19.709
I have fantastic tits.
Tell him I have fantastic tits.

33:23.311 --> 33:25.347
Chicken for you.

33:25.480 --> 33:26.716
- Hi!
- And chicken...

33:26.849 --> 33:30.252
- Chicken for you.
- How about some chicken?

33:30.385 --> 33:33.122
What about biscuits?
Do we have any biscuits?

33:33.255 --> 33:34.724
There you go.

33:36.258 --> 33:37.694
They seem delighted. I would be.

33:37.827 --> 33:40.963
Okay, great. And cut.
Uh, okay, we're gonna reset.

33:41.229 --> 33:43.766
We'll come in for a close-up.
If you could get the food back.

33:43.900 --> 33:46.234
So just remember
who you gave it to.

33:46.368 --> 33:47.569
Just need to take this back.

33:48.871 --> 33:49.806
Hey, sorry.

33:49.939 --> 33:51.573
- Hey, you're getting them...
- Aah!

33:51.708 --> 33:54.509
- Chill! I'm gonna give it...
- What are you doing? Hey!

33:54.643 --> 33:56.611
Look, you're gonna get it back!

33:56.746 --> 33:58.715
What are you doing?
We don't need this food then.

33:58.848 --> 34:01.349
- You're gonna get it back.
- Wild misunderstanding.

34:01.483 --> 34:02.517
We're just resetting.

34:02.651 --> 34:04.187
There's a lot of them,
isn't it?

34:04.319 --> 34:05.688
Shit, are they filming this?

34:05.822 --> 34:08.223
This time, when we give you
the food,

34:08.356 --> 34:10.193
if you could just be happy.
Smiling.

34:10.324 --> 34:12.293
- Happy.
- Is that okay?

34:12.427 --> 34:14.228
- Let's do it. Not really okay.
- Great.

34:14.362 --> 34:16.799
Okay, great.
When you're ready, head on in.

34:16.933 --> 34:18.134
Hi.

34:18.266 --> 34:20.770
Would you like some chicken?

34:20.902 --> 34:23.139
- Yummy. Delicious.
- Yeah.

34:24.371 --> 34:25.775
Not laughing. It's not funny.

34:25.908 --> 34:27.242
It's... It's happy.

34:27.375 --> 34:29.411
- Excuse me.
- That's good, huh?

34:29.543 --> 34:30.980
- That's a bit much.
- Oi!

34:31.214 --> 34:33.447
Maybe smile a bit less
than that. Just a bit less.

34:33.581 --> 34:35.484
That's lovely. Perfect, see?

34:38.688 --> 34:40.422
I'm afraid we have
to ask you to go.

34:40.554 --> 34:42.859
No, we are not going
to leave. It's public beach.

34:42.992 --> 34:46.460
Yeah, it's a public beach,
but to visit, not to stay.

34:46.594 --> 34:49.699
There are hungry children here
that we're trying to feed.

34:49.831 --> 34:51.632
Look at me.
We have right to stay here.

34:51.768 --> 34:53.168
- You don't.
- Your father asked us...

34:53.301 --> 34:55.437
- A baby is crying.
- I've got instructions.

34:55.570 --> 34:58.808
There are children here! Poor
children we're trying to feed!

34:58.941 --> 35:01.744
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.

35:01.878 --> 35:03.780
Look, we're allowed
to film here!

35:03.913 --> 35:05.248
Look, there's a baby!

35:05.380 --> 35:07.382
Hey, let's chill out,
chill out.

35:07.516 --> 35:09.484
And he's crying!

35:11.319 --> 35:13.655
Yeah, just... Thanks.
Let's do this nicely.

35:13.790 --> 35:15.357
Let's everyone go.

35:15.490 --> 35:17.059
We don't want trouble.

35:19.327 --> 35:20.662
- Aw...
- Have you ever seen

35:20.797 --> 35:22.265
a baby cry like that?

35:22.397 --> 35:24.566
I know. You're very charitable.

35:24.700 --> 35:27.469
Let us go. Let us go.

35:29.404 --> 35:30.907
It's all right. It's okay.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.642
- Fantastic. Got all of that.
- I'm gonna have a panic attack.

35:33.776 --> 35:35.678
You can't have tents here.

35:35.812 --> 35:37.847
- You have to move.
- I was trying to help!

35:37.980 --> 35:40.549
I know. I saw.

35:42.852 --> 35:44.887
Sorry. There's so much stuff.

35:45.021 --> 35:47.223
I should probably have
kept a log,

35:47.355 --> 35:48.557
but you know what it's like.

35:48.691 --> 35:50.525
Would have been a good idea,

35:50.659 --> 35:52.795
or if you had labeled
any of the footage.

35:52.929 --> 35:54.263
The chaos of war.

35:55.731 --> 35:57.300
Not really a war, was it?

35:57.432 --> 35:59.902
I think maybe, when I thought
I was turning it off,

36:00.036 --> 36:02.404
- I was turning it on.
- No, definitely. Yeah.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.842
Oh, there's one.

36:05.975 --> 36:08.077
<i>Say "Happy
birthday, Sir Richard."</i>

36:08.311 --> 36:11.113
<i>Happy birthday, Sir Richard!</i>

36:11.346 --> 36:12.882
Hiya.

36:13.015 --> 36:15.117
Oh, hi. Thanks.

36:15.350 --> 36:17.253
How's it going?

36:17.385 --> 36:19.689
- Fine.
- Hi.

36:24.626 --> 36:27.562
This is the next factory.

36:29.664 --> 36:30.967
I know that place.

36:31.100 --> 36:33.336
- It's in Sri Lanka.
- Yeah. How do you know?

36:33.468 --> 36:34.871
My Aunt Amali works there.

36:35.004 --> 36:37.539
- Thought you were from Leicester.
- My uncle adopted me

36:37.672 --> 36:39.909
- when I was 7.
- So your uncle's in Leicester

36:40.042 --> 36:42.644
- and your aunt's in Sri Lanka?
- Different uncle.

36:42.778 --> 36:44.113
- She still works there?
- Yeah.

36:44.347 --> 36:46.983
Well, she might be
in this footage. Hold on.

36:47.116 --> 36:48.550
How much is there?

36:48.684 --> 36:49.986
All the footage in the world.

36:50.119 --> 36:52.587
You know,
I was hired as a writer.

36:52.722 --> 36:54.623
When I write,
there's ink in the pen.

36:56.591 --> 36:57.793
Yes, that's definitely one.

36:57.927 --> 36:59.328
<i>Right, I'm rolling.</i>

36:59.461 --> 37:00.830
<i>"Happy birthday, Sir Richard."</i>

37:00.963 --> 37:02.999
<i>Happy birthday, Sir Richard.</i>

37:03.132 --> 37:05.368
No, no. No, she's not there.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.337
- There's a bit more.
- Is that...?

37:08.470 --> 37:10.605
I think I might have gone
to the loo.

37:10.740 --> 37:12.141
- I'll just...
- Skip forward a bit.

37:12.375 --> 37:13.408
That's not nice.

37:21.017 --> 37:23.686
Where are all the others,
Giannis?

37:23.819 --> 37:25.922
- They don't come.
- Why?

37:26.055 --> 37:29.658
They heard about the double
money, so they won't come.

37:29.792 --> 37:32.560
What do you mean? That should
make them want to come.

37:32.695 --> 37:35.831
They are Bulgarians. Only Greeks
getting double money.

37:35.965 --> 37:38.401
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Giannis, man!

37:38.533 --> 37:39.902
Tell them they'll get the money!

37:40.036 --> 37:42.437
Get them down here!
We'll give them double money!

37:42.570 --> 37:44.707
- Go and get them, Giannis!
- They won't come!

37:44.840 --> 37:45.942
Why?

37:46.075 --> 37:47.609
They already have
different jobs.

37:47.743 --> 37:49.511
Oh, for fuck's sake!

37:49.644 --> 37:53.049
Fucking donkey fuck, Giannis!

37:53.182 --> 37:54.917
Fucking arsehole!

37:55.051 --> 37:56.052
Bell end!

37:56.185 --> 37:57.485
Prick, Giannis!

37:57.619 --> 37:59.355
Prick!

37:59.487 --> 38:02.792
- Have we come at a bad time?
- Yes, it's a bad time!

38:02.925 --> 38:05.527
It's always a bad fucking time!

38:05.660 --> 38:07.863
It's very much bad o'clock!

38:07.997 --> 38:10.032
Fucking Giannis!

38:10.166 --> 38:13.002
Fucking twerp!

38:13.135 --> 38:16.571
You know this word,
Giannis? Twerp!

38:16.706 --> 38:19.541
You wrote the fucking book
on it! Bell end!

38:22.144 --> 38:24.714
I look like I've had a fight
with a pair of curtains.

38:24.847 --> 38:26.382
Pull yourself together.

38:26.514 --> 38:29.251
Oh, very good.
Very good for you.

38:29.484 --> 38:31.687
So we're gonna set
the fireworks off from there,

38:31.821 --> 38:33.956
halfway between the beach
and the amphitheater.

38:34.090 --> 38:35.057
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:35.191 --> 38:36.658
So the light from the rockets

38:36.792 --> 38:38.961
- is gonna flood the amphitheater.
- Quick question.

38:39.095 --> 38:40.730
Are you fucking
out of your mind?

38:40.863 --> 38:42.698
Clarence is a wild animal.

38:42.832 --> 38:44.467
Can't be flooding his cage.

38:44.599 --> 38:47.003
I'm not flooding his cage.
I'm flooding it with light.

38:47.136 --> 38:49.038
Uh, cover...
You could cover his cage.

38:49.171 --> 38:52.674
- They do that with parrots.
- But he's not a parrot, mate.

38:52.808 --> 38:55.845
He's a more intelligent,
sensual being than a parrot.

38:56.979 --> 38:58.613
What is it?

39:00.016 --> 39:02.785
You look very thin.
Making me look fat.

39:02.918 --> 39:04.954
I am. Thin Finn. Sounds good.

39:05.087 --> 39:06.088
And you look pale.

39:06.222 --> 39:09.425
Yes. I'm pale. And loitering.

39:09.557 --> 39:10.558
Are you on crack?

39:11.794 --> 39:13.929
I'm not on crack, Mum. Jesus.

39:14.063 --> 39:15.931
- Ecstasy?
- No.

39:16.065 --> 39:17.500
What about prescription pills?

39:17.632 --> 39:20.903
- Jeez, Mum, I'm not...
- Cocaine?

39:21.037 --> 39:24.040
MDMA? Or "Molly,"
as the young people call it.

39:24.173 --> 39:26.809
Mum, I'm not on drugs, okay?

39:26.942 --> 39:29.445
I haven't seen you
this depressed ever, Finn.

39:29.577 --> 39:32.048
And you're growing pubic hair
on your face.

39:32.181 --> 39:33.449
It's not pu...

39:33.581 --> 39:36.819
It looks wispy,
and it doesn't suit you.

39:36.952 --> 39:39.288
Frankly, you should shave it off
before the party.

39:39.522 --> 39:40.990
It's an embarrassment.

39:44.093 --> 39:46.162
- Hi.
- This is Nick.

39:46.295 --> 39:47.863
He's chronicling my life.

39:47.997 --> 39:49.664
Chronicling? That's a bit grand.

39:49.799 --> 39:52.535
Yeah, like <i>The Chronicles
of Narnia.</i> We...

39:52.667 --> 39:56.072
We could call it <i>The Lion,
the Witch and the Wardrobe.</i>

39:56.205 --> 39:59.108
Not that you're a witch,
obviously.

39:59.241 --> 40:03.045
We met, actually, in Monaco.
Don't know if you remember.

40:03.179 --> 40:04.313
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:15.858 --> 40:17.526
Hi. Um...

40:17.659 --> 40:19.495
I'm here to see
Samantha McCreadie.

40:19.627 --> 40:22.765
- Yes, of course. Come aboard.
- Oh, thank you.

40:22.898 --> 40:26.535
This is
a really spectacular yacht.

40:26.668 --> 40:28.137
Thank you.
This is actually my baby.

40:28.270 --> 40:30.672
I designed everything
on her by myself.

40:30.806 --> 40:32.975
- Wow, that's lovely.
- Yeah, the fabrics, the wood.

40:33.109 --> 40:36.779
Everything. The basketball court
upstairs. It's all my taste.

40:36.912 --> 40:39.014
So just let's, um,
start off with,

40:39.148 --> 40:40.716
when did you meet Sir Richard?

40:40.850 --> 40:43.219
When I first met Rich,
he was a bottom-feeder.

40:43.352 --> 40:44.553
I met him in a casino.

40:44.687 --> 40:46.789
All right. My lucky number's 13.

40:46.922 --> 40:48.124
Maybe it'll bring me luck.

40:48.257 --> 40:49.525
No more bets.

40:49.657 --> 40:52.361
- Number 13.
- Oh!

40:52.595 --> 40:54.830
<i>♪ Sincerity ♪</i>

40:54.964 --> 40:56.932
<i>♪ Come on, give me... ♪</i>

40:57.066 --> 40:59.001
- What are you doing?
- I wanna see you again.

40:59.135 --> 41:01.137
I'm playing hard to get.

41:05.207 --> 41:07.176
Can I see you tomorrow?

41:08.944 --> 41:10.613
Well, was that a yes or a no?

41:11.881 --> 41:13.382
It's a yes!

41:13.616 --> 41:15.084
He'd worked in fashion
all his life,

41:15.217 --> 41:16.852
but he didn't have
a feel for it.

41:16.986 --> 41:19.822
He wasn't somebody who loved
clothes. He just loves deals.

41:19.955 --> 41:22.558
You lied to me, right?
You fucking lied to me.

41:22.691 --> 41:24.393
You're like a dodgy priest.

41:24.627 --> 41:26.829
Now you've been caught
balls deep in a choirboy.

41:26.962 --> 41:29.664
- What are you talking about?
- You said these were quality.

41:29.798 --> 41:31.800
They're not quality.

41:31.934 --> 41:34.136
"Pride Jeans." Yeah,
if you're proud to wear them

41:34.270 --> 41:37.439
and look like a tit. I'll give
you 1.2 million in cash

41:37.672 --> 41:39.041
if you wipe off the debt.

41:39.175 --> 41:41.410
Is that a joke?

41:41.644 --> 41:44.780
I'll give you 20p in a pound
on the debt, but that's it.

41:44.914 --> 41:47.850
When I leave with this case of
cash, the deal's off the table.

41:47.983 --> 41:50.653
I'll tell you something,
no one's gonna give you diddly

41:50.786 --> 41:52.621
for that pile of blue shit.

41:55.257 --> 41:57.459
Okay! Okay.

41:57.693 --> 41:59.094
Come back.

42:00.763 --> 42:02.231
- So he was a bottom-feeder then.
- Yes.

42:02.364 --> 42:03.732
But what changed?

42:03.866 --> 42:06.669
Well, I brought him here
to Monaco.

42:06.802 --> 42:09.038
- Can you guess which boat?
- Is it the biggest one?

42:09.171 --> 42:11.774
<i>Everybody's a billionaire here.
We were just small fry.</i>

42:11.907 --> 42:13.677
- Is that our boat? That one?
- No.

42:13.809 --> 42:16.979
- <i>We were just millionaires.</i>
- That's right. Well done.

42:17.112 --> 42:18.280
Hey, no!

42:18.414 --> 42:22.184
What we do in life
echoes in eternity.

42:22.318 --> 42:24.820
I taught him that,
from <i>Gladiator.</i>

42:24.954 --> 42:26.488
Hey, watch his eyes.

42:28.224 --> 42:31.327
You shall watch
as I bathe in his blood.

42:31.460 --> 42:34.663
- Rich.
- Well, I didn't teach him that.

42:34.797 --> 42:36.799
I'm not even sure
it's in the film.

42:36.932 --> 42:39.134
That was so close to his eye!
Put your sword down!

42:39.268 --> 42:41.237
- Aah!
- Both of you, now, put them down!

42:41.370 --> 42:42.972
Money makes money.

42:43.105 --> 42:45.241
And when people think
you have money,

42:45.374 --> 42:46.875
then they give you more.

42:47.009 --> 42:48.712
They have no idea
of the bottom line.

42:48.844 --> 42:49.979
Why don't you buy
the whole group?

42:50.112 --> 42:51.247
That's what I said.

42:51.380 --> 42:53.849
- Not a problem, is it, Bob?
- We're a bank.

42:53.983 --> 42:55.685
We lend money.
That's what we do.

42:55.818 --> 42:58.654
So then we bought M&J
for 200 million.

42:58.787 --> 43:01.123
Is this Blackpool Illuminations?

43:01.257 --> 43:02.891
What is the wattage
of these bulbs?

43:03.025 --> 43:05.361
- Hundred.
- Well, swap them out for 60s.

43:05.494 --> 43:08.998
You can't put 60-watt bulbs
up there. It's too gloomy.

43:09.131 --> 43:13.068
You know what I say? I don't do
"can't do." I only do "can do."

43:16.005 --> 43:18.073
Thanks so much for making
the time to see me.

43:18.207 --> 43:20.509
Oh, any chance
to slag off Sir Greedy.

43:20.744 --> 43:23.713
- Oh, you weren't a fan, then?
- Oh, he was a bully.

43:23.846 --> 43:27.684
That is the biggest pile of crap
I've ever seen. Get rid of it.

43:27.816 --> 43:30.687
We can't get rid of it.
We've ordered it. It's ours.

43:30.819 --> 43:32.988
You... How much
have you paid for this?

43:33.122 --> 43:34.923
The whole range
across all the stores...

43:35.057 --> 43:36.325
- Five million.
- Five million...?

43:36.458 --> 43:38.394
Are you fucking kidding?
Tell me he's joking.

43:38.527 --> 43:40.296
- No.
- That is robbery.

43:40.429 --> 43:41.964
I should call the police.

43:42.097 --> 43:45.702
He wasn't a businessman.
He was a parasite. Tapeworm.

43:45.834 --> 43:48.170
I'll give you 3 million for it.

43:50.105 --> 43:51.974
Nod your head and shake my hand.

43:52.107 --> 43:55.311
Come on, nod your head
and shake my hand.

43:58.113 --> 43:59.281
All right, Mark. Well done.

43:59.415 --> 44:02.351
You got a good deal.
You, come with me.

44:06.121 --> 44:08.324
That was a negotiation.

44:08.457 --> 44:09.958
You are a buyer.

44:10.092 --> 44:12.261
You're supposed
to fucking negotiate.

44:12.394 --> 44:15.431
You nearly cost me
2 million pounds there.

44:15.564 --> 44:18.300
You need to take a long,
hard look in the mirror and say:

44:18.434 --> 44:21.537
"I am a cunt," because you are.

44:26.842 --> 44:28.243
Fuck you.

44:28.377 --> 44:31.046
M&J got us onto
the <i>Sunday Times</i> Rich List.

44:31.180 --> 44:33.148
They valued it at a billion.

44:33.282 --> 44:35.752

44:35.884 --> 44:37.086

Let's, uh, take a look
in a little more detail

45:46.588 --> 45:49.158
at your takeover of M&J.

45:49.291 --> 45:53.028
Can you stop staring at me,
please? It's very off-putting.

45:54.563 --> 45:56.231
During your ownership of M&J,

45:56.365 --> 45:58.902
your family took
more than 400 million pounds

45:59.034 --> 46:00.669
out of the company.

46:00.904 --> 46:02.971
- Is that right?
- We were the owners.

46:03.105 --> 46:05.674
- Wow!
- You got a conference room there.

46:05.909 --> 46:07.142
You've got a screening room,

46:07.276 --> 46:09.846
- a library for meetings.
- This is the gravy.

46:09.978 --> 46:12.114
Whilst M&J went
from having assets

46:12.247 --> 46:13.949
of almost 300 million pounds

46:14.082 --> 46:17.352
to debts of more
than 250 million pounds.

46:17.486 --> 46:19.955
In other words, the company lost
550 million pounds

46:20.088 --> 46:22.692
whilst your family gained
400 million pounds.

46:22.926 --> 46:24.560
And I got this for you.

46:24.694 --> 46:27.396
It's an ancient Egyptian lion.

46:27.529 --> 46:30.165
- How old is it?
- Well, it's new.

46:30.299 --> 46:32.134
It's an exact copy
of the original.

46:32.267 --> 46:34.203
Right, but it's a fake.

46:34.336 --> 46:35.939
- But this is real.
- Wha...?

46:36.071 --> 46:38.741
- A giant prehistoric bird bone.
- Wow!

46:38.974 --> 46:40.877
Do you know what?
I don't normally go

46:41.009 --> 46:45.949
for large prehistoric birds,
but, uh, that is just genius.

46:48.517 --> 46:49.551
Sally.

46:49.686 --> 46:51.286
This is Sally,
our fashion editor.

46:51.420 --> 46:52.988
You probably want to talk
to her.

46:53.121 --> 46:54.490
This is Nick.
He's writing a book

46:54.623 --> 46:56.091
- about Greedy McCreadie.
- Oh, hi.

46:56.225 --> 46:58.327
- Hi. You're the fashion editor?
- Yes.

46:58.460 --> 47:01.163
Why? Did you expect me to look
a bit more like a model?

47:02.364 --> 47:03.933
No, no. Of course not.

47:04.066 --> 47:05.601
Uh, not that you don't.

47:05.735 --> 47:08.905
You look gr... Very...
You look great.

47:09.037 --> 47:10.773
Uh, this is
our city desk over here

47:11.006 --> 47:12.608
- if you want to follow me.
- Nice to meet you.

47:12.742 --> 47:14.343
- Yeah, and you. Yeah.
- Okay?

47:14.476 --> 47:16.545
It's just round here,
Jim is, okay?

47:16.679 --> 47:20.482
Um, so I was hoping you could
try and help me understand

47:20.616 --> 47:22.251
the mechanics of the deals. I...

47:22.384 --> 47:25.587
I know nothing about business.
I mean, I'm not an idiot,

47:25.722 --> 47:28.524
but, uh, it might be easiest
if you imagine I am one,

47:28.657 --> 47:31.126
and then I can tell you
if I find that patronizing.

47:33.228 --> 47:35.130
I mean, I know
what a savings account is.

47:35.264 --> 47:37.599
Well, that's not relevant
to this.

47:37.734 --> 47:39.368
No, I know. I'm... I'm...

47:39.501 --> 47:42.104
I'm just saying,
feel free to talk down to me.

47:42.237 --> 47:44.206
Most people don't have
a problem with that.

47:44.339 --> 47:47.276
That won't be necessary.
It's all pretty simple.

47:47.409 --> 47:50.078
McCreadie has a whole bunch
of interconnected companies,

47:50.212 --> 47:52.414
but let's take the example
of the biggest, Monda.

47:52.548 --> 47:55.250
<i>The jewel in his crown. Monda
made him a household name.</i>

47:55.384 --> 47:57.954
<i>When McCreadie bought Monda,
it was a public company</i>

47:58.086 --> 48:00.790
<i>listed on the stock exchange.
Anyone can buy shares in it.</i>

48:01.024 --> 48:02.992
<i>People are buying
and selling all the time.</i>

48:03.125 --> 48:05.060
<i>Add up the shares, you get
the value of the company.</i>

48:05.193 --> 48:07.663
<i>In the case of Monda, that was
about 900 million pounds.</i>

48:07.797 --> 48:09.364
McCreadie was
one of the pioneers

48:09.498 --> 48:11.166
of taking
public companies private.

48:11.300 --> 48:13.268
<i>To do that, you have
to buy all the shares,</i>

48:13.402 --> 48:14.570
<i>900 million pounds worth,</i>

48:14.704 --> 48:16.438
<i>but he didn't have
that much money.</i>

48:16.572 --> 48:18.674
<i>Even if he did, he didn't
like to use his own money.</i>

48:18.808 --> 48:21.176
What do you do when you
don't have enough money?

48:21.310 --> 48:24.047
I usually call my parents,
and they tell me to piss off.

48:26.049 --> 48:28.584
But I imagine
he didn't call my parents.

48:28.718 --> 48:32.521
Uh, I think he probably
borrowed it. Did he borrow it?

48:32.654 --> 48:36.091
So Greed invites a few friends
down to his yacht in Monaco,

48:36.224 --> 48:39.227
<i>including Bob,
his banker from HBOS.</i>

48:39.361 --> 48:42.531
<i>McCreadie persuades Bob to lend
him 95 percent of the money.</i>

48:42.664 --> 48:45.167
<i>Then he calls the CEO of Monda
and makes an offer.</i>

48:45.300 --> 48:47.369
What the fuck?
It's the middle of the night.

48:47.502 --> 48:50.606

No, McCreadie doesn't
owe anything.

49:29.679 --> 49:33.215
Monda owes HBOS
the money used to buy Monda.

49:33.348 --> 49:38.520
So he used Monda's money
to buy Monda? Is that legal?

49:38.654 --> 49:40.123
It's totally legal.

49:40.255 --> 49:42.190
McCreadie was one
of the pioneers of this,

49:42.324 --> 49:43.558
but it happens all the time.

49:43.693 --> 49:46.461
<i>So now Monda has
a big old chunky debt,</i>

49:46.595 --> 49:48.630
<i>890 million pounds.</i>

49:48.765 --> 49:51.633
<i>But Monda owns a lot of shops
on a lot of high streets.</i>

49:51.768 --> 49:54.137
<i>Owns them.
Property is valuable.</i>

49:54.269 --> 49:56.139
<i>The last 20 years,
it's trebled in value.</i>

49:56.271 --> 49:58.573
<i>So McCreadie gets Monda
to sell the properties</i>

49:58.708 --> 50:00.342
<i>and then rent them instead.</i>

50:00.475 --> 50:01.678
<i>There's no short-term gains,</i>

50:01.811 --> 50:03.478
<i>but one shop alone
on Oxford Street</i>

50:03.612 --> 50:05.647
<i>netted 200 million pounds.</i>

50:05.782 --> 50:07.917
So the sale of property
pays off the debt

50:08.151 --> 50:10.753
and increases the profits,
so he looks like a genius.

50:10.887 --> 50:14.556
When really Monda has just
sold off all its assets.

50:14.691 --> 50:19.394
And that's how he paid himself,
or his wife, 1.2 billion pounds

50:19.528 --> 50:22.364
<i>as a dividend
two years after buying Monda.</i>

50:22.497 --> 50:24.599
So it was only really
800 million pounds,

50:24.734 --> 50:26.736
but we rolled over
400 from the year before

50:26.869 --> 50:29.504
so that Rich could make it
the biggest dividend ever

50:29.638 --> 50:31.406
because he loves
a headline like that.

50:31.540 --> 50:33.275
That's Rich.
It's all about image.

50:33.408 --> 50:35.178
He used to do magic tricks
as a child.

50:35.310 --> 50:38.213
So the first principle of magic
is to distract your audience.

50:38.346 --> 50:39.682
Make them look
at your left hand

50:39.816 --> 50:41.583
while your right hand
takes the watch.

50:41.718 --> 50:43.385
That's how McCreadie
works with his dividend.

50:43.518 --> 50:45.387
So he paid the 1.2 billion

50:45.520 --> 50:47.456
from the money he made
selling the shops?

50:47.589 --> 50:50.559
No. Monda borrowed
the 1.2 billion

50:50.693 --> 50:53.328
<i>from Bob the Banker
to pay his family.</i>

50:53.462 --> 50:56.631
That's outrageous. So Monda then
owes all that to the bank.

50:56.766 --> 50:59.769
It's the same with M&J,
with all Greed's business deals.

50:59.902 --> 51:01.971
<i>Because the dividends
are paid to Samantha,</i>

51:02.205 --> 51:04.606
<i>and she is resident in Monaco
which has no income tax,</i>

51:04.741 --> 51:07.210
<i>McCreadie saves
300 million pounds in tax,</i>

51:07.342 --> 51:08.778
<i>100 million of which she uses</i>

51:08.911 --> 51:10.412
<i>to buy
a nice little runaround.</i>

51:10.545 --> 51:12.514
<i>It is classic asset stripping</i>

51:12.647 --> 51:15.584
<i>and classic tax avoidance.</i>

51:15.718 --> 51:17.687
It's all just
one gigantic dodge, isn't it?

51:17.820 --> 51:20.555
Is this an investigation
into my tax affairs?

51:20.690 --> 51:23.525
I pay what I have to and no more
because I'm not stupid.

51:23.658 --> 51:26.294
If you wanna chase people
avoiding tax,

51:26.428 --> 51:28.164
why don't you go after
the big boys?

51:28.296 --> 51:30.733
I mean, look at Apple,
look at Amazon, Starbucks.

51:30.867 --> 51:33.401
- Why are you chasing me?
- Right, it's not them we're...

51:33.535 --> 51:35.504
I suggest you Google it,
Mr. Chairman.

51:35.637 --> 51:38.507
That's another company. How much
tax do you think Google pay?

51:38.640 --> 51:41.409
Not very much. If you don't
believe me, talk to Bono.

51:41.543 --> 51:43.378
He's avoided hundreds
of millions in tax

51:43.512 --> 51:45.715
by claiming that U2
are based in Holland.

51:45.848 --> 51:47.784
Doesn't stop him
going around the world

51:47.917 --> 51:51.187
in your nan's sunglasses
proclaiming, uh,

51:51.319 --> 51:53.321
about ending poverty
or whatever.

51:53.455 --> 51:55.057
This is him in the <i>Daily Mail.</i>

51:55.290 --> 51:59.494
"'You'd be stupid not to try and
cut your tax bill, ' says Bono."

51:59.628 --> 52:01.230
Nobody that lives here pays tax.

52:01.363 --> 52:03.365
Nobody on any of these boats
is paying tax.

52:03.498 --> 52:05.600
That's just the rules.
I'm following the rules.

52:05.735 --> 52:07.302
There's nothing wrong with that.

52:07.435 --> 52:09.872
<i>The super yacht, the models,</i>

52:10.006 --> 52:11.774
<i>the glamorous parties.</i>

52:11.908 --> 52:13.441
<i>Rich being photographed</i>

52:13.575 --> 52:16.045
<i>alongside Naomi or Kate
or Sienna, whomever.</i>

52:16.279 --> 52:17.713
<i>It's all part of a brand.</i>

52:17.847 --> 52:20.415
<i>It adds a little sparkle
to a $10 party dress.</i>

52:20.549 --> 52:23.385
Wow, that was amazing.

52:23.518 --> 52:26.321
- So why did you divorce?
- Rich likes to win.

52:26.454 --> 52:28.825
And what do you get
when you win? You get a...

52:28.958 --> 52:31.294
- A medal?
- A trophy.

52:31.426 --> 52:33.262
Naomi's that trophy for him.

52:33.395 --> 52:34.663
I mean, I'm not
a gynecologist,

52:34.797 --> 52:36.598
but I know a cunt
when I see one.

52:44.539 --> 52:47.576
- Do you miss Monaco?
- I miss the boat.

52:47.710 --> 52:50.378
I still think that is
the best thing we ever made,

52:50.512 --> 52:53.783
excluding Adrian and Lily,
but including Finn.

52:55.818 --> 52:57.720
Is there anything else you miss?

52:59.822 --> 53:02.591
Just getting a water for Naomi.

53:02.725 --> 53:04.459
She can see you guys,
by the way.

53:04.593 --> 53:05.895
Thank you, Finn.

53:06.028 --> 53:08.563
These lions guarded
Apollo's temple.

53:08.698 --> 53:09.564
Really?

53:09.699 --> 53:10.766
I don't know

53:10.900 --> 53:12.567
what's going on with us,
Faby.

53:12.702 --> 53:14.770
I'm sorry.

53:14.904 --> 53:17.639
I'm a fucking damn fool.

53:17.773 --> 53:20.142
But I still love your soul.

53:20.375 --> 53:24.146
I swore that I'd never cry
for another man.

53:24.379 --> 53:27.683
Baby, baby, don't cry.

53:30.585 --> 53:32.722
- Uh, yeah. Uh, Lily?
- Yeah?

53:32.855 --> 53:34.857
Yeah, um, so it says
in the script

53:34.991 --> 53:36.625
- that you're crying.
- Tears?

53:36.759 --> 53:38.393
Yeah, if we could
have some tears.

53:38.526 --> 53:40.863
- Okay. Give me a minute.
- Yeah. Sure. No, okay.

53:40.997 --> 53:43.465
Just take a minute. Give us
a shout when you're ready.

53:43.598 --> 53:45.567
- Want me to poke you in the eye?
- Fuck off.

53:45.701 --> 53:47.837
All right, all right.
It's just an idea.

53:47.970 --> 53:50.605
See, I always think of Diana
when I need to cry.

53:50.740 --> 53:53.309
I reckon
she would have loved it here.

53:53.441 --> 53:56.478
This is the place where
Apollo and Artemis were born.

53:56.611 --> 53:58.180
No, that's all a myth.

53:58.413 --> 54:00.349
This place was built on trade.

54:00.482 --> 54:02.018
Built by men like me.

54:02.151 --> 54:04.887
This was once
the biggest trading post

54:05.021 --> 54:06.822
in the whole
of the Mediterranean.

54:06.956 --> 54:08.925
Commercial center of the world.

54:09.058 --> 54:11.761
And look at it now, ruins.

54:11.894 --> 54:16.332
"A coward dies many times
before his death...

54:16.464 --> 54:21.636
but the valiant never
taste of death but once."

54:21.771 --> 54:23.839
Just reading
off your bloody phone, Rich.

54:23.973 --> 54:26.943
Yeah. BrainyQuote.
I love BrainyQuote.

54:27.076 --> 54:29.412
Don't worry, Dad.
You're gonna die soon enough.

54:29.544 --> 54:32.214
- Finn.
- Oh, come on. It's just banter.

54:32.447 --> 54:37.019
Don't say "banter" like some
Hooray Henry horse fondler.

54:37.153 --> 54:38.620
I'm only 60.

54:38.754 --> 54:41.357
Rupert's still running
News Corp in his 80s.

54:41.489 --> 54:42.758
Maybe I'll skip a generation,

54:42.892 --> 54:44.226
leave everything
to your children.

54:44.459 --> 54:45.962
If you find anyone
to have children with.

54:46.095 --> 54:47.930
- Oh, Ricky.
- "I knew a man who once said,

54:48.064 --> 54:49.398
'Death smiles at us all,

54:49.531 --> 54:51.834
and all a man can do
is smile back.'"

54:53.069 --> 54:55.237
That's...
That's a bit weird.

54:55.470 --> 54:57.505
He's quoting <i>Gladiator.</i>

54:57.639 --> 54:58.640
- You all right?
- Yeah.

54:58.774 --> 55:01.077
I swore that I would never cry

55:01.210 --> 55:03.412
- for another man.
- Hey.

55:03.545 --> 55:04.914
- Cut!
- Then don't cry.

55:05.047 --> 55:06.581
- Fuck's sake.
- Are you kidding?

55:06.716 --> 55:08.851
- Get out of my shot, Finn!
- Were you guys acting?

55:08.985 --> 55:10.686
- Sorry.
- Move out of the fucking way!

55:13.823 --> 55:16.092
- I think she's actually crying.
- Yeah, she is.

55:16.225 --> 55:19.028
You want it? Okay, Lily,
just go for it. Just use that.

55:19.161 --> 55:21.697
- Yeah? Okay. Going.
- Yeah, fantastic. Go for it.

55:21.831 --> 55:22.765
Open the gate.

55:26.135 --> 55:28.037
Clarence. Good boy.
Look at that.

55:28.170 --> 55:29.604
Come on. Look, look, look.

55:30.973 --> 55:32.808
Good, Clarence. Good, good.

55:32.942 --> 55:35.444
Go, go, go, go.

55:35.577 --> 55:36.746
Ha! Ha!

55:36.879 --> 55:38.546
Clarence, go.

55:38.681 --> 55:41.583
- Ha-da! Clarence!
- Ah! Ah!

55:43.019 --> 55:44.787
Is he always like this?

55:44.920 --> 55:46.554
Give him a minute.
He needs to warm up.

55:46.689 --> 55:48.791
He needs to find his motivation.
Come on. Ha-da!

55:48.924 --> 55:51.293
We were just hoping
he'd have a bit more energy.

55:51.526 --> 55:53.496
He will. He just...

55:53.628 --> 55:56.132
He's got a bit of stage fright.
A bit frozen.

55:56.265 --> 55:58.666
Rich is expecting him
to be the star of the show.

55:58.801 --> 55:59.667
Yeah.

55:59.802 --> 56:01.971
He will be. He just, you know...

56:03.671 --> 56:05.041
He's not very good.

56:05.174 --> 56:06.909
Oi. Look, slower, slower.

56:07.043 --> 56:08.844
- But not so close to him, okay?
- Okay.

56:08.978 --> 56:11.747
Show him the meat. You're not
trying to kill him. Come on.

56:11.881 --> 56:14.050
- Good boy. Come on!
- It's gonna be a disaster.

56:16.986 --> 56:19.522
Do you know any tricks
to make him a bit more scary?

56:19.654 --> 56:22.925
- Well, these are the tricks.
- I'm not frightened at all.

56:23.059 --> 56:24.760
I thought he'd be frightening.

56:24.894 --> 56:27.096
He will be. He will be.

56:28.596 --> 56:30.299
Oh, fuck. They're back.

56:30.533 --> 56:31.666
Hello!

56:31.801 --> 56:32.935
That's all we need.

56:33.069 --> 56:34.737
Hello!

56:34.870 --> 56:36.305
- Hi.
- Hello!

56:37.807 --> 56:40.342
The nomads are back
on the beach.

56:40.575 --> 56:42.845
We can't do anything
about it. It's a public beach.

56:42.978 --> 56:44.980
I don't care.
I don't want them at my party.

56:45.114 --> 56:48.583
We've got a bigger problem. The
<i>Daily Mail</i> got hold of this.

56:48.717 --> 56:50.352
This is terrible
for our reputation.

56:50.585 --> 56:51.987
What do you mean,
your reputation?

56:52.121 --> 56:54.690
No one knows who you are.
How bad is it?

56:54.824 --> 56:57.326
I've had the agents
on the phone nonstop.

56:57.560 --> 57:01.063
Angelina's definitely not
coming. Rihanna's now a maybe.

57:01.197 --> 57:04.166
- They're in breach of contract.
- Don't worry. I'll put a call in.

57:04.300 --> 57:07.203
No one reads <i>The Mail</i> online.
It's cleavage clickbait.

57:07.336 --> 57:09.805
Yeah, except
I'm the tit this time.

57:15.711 --> 57:18.814
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

57:20.648 --> 57:22.118
How long did it take?

57:22.251 --> 57:23.752
A day and a half.

57:26.222 --> 57:29.291
- Just for this one arch?
- Yes.

57:42.171 --> 57:43.638
J. Lo's still good.

57:43.772 --> 57:45.007
Ed Sheeran, probably a no.

57:45.141 --> 57:46.641
- And Harry's a no.
- Harry Styles?

57:46.775 --> 57:48.944
Mm-mm. Prince Harry.

57:49.078 --> 57:52.014
- You could get doubles.
- That's not a bad idea.

57:52.148 --> 57:55.117
Like kings on the battlefield
using decoys.

57:55.251 --> 57:56.886
- Did they?
- They did in Shakespeare.

57:57.019 --> 57:59.889
We could put them in the dark.
No one would see them. It's...

58:00.022 --> 58:01.157
- Yeah.
- In the shadows.

58:01.290 --> 58:03.392
Long lens, backlit,
in and out of shot.

58:03.626 --> 58:04.994
That's great. Melanie?

58:05.127 --> 58:06.195
It can work. It can work.

58:06.328 --> 58:07.263
- Thanks, Nick.
- Sorry.

58:07.396 --> 58:09.265
It was intended as a joke.

58:09.398 --> 58:11.200
Can't help it
if my jokes are so shit,

58:11.333 --> 58:13.769
they get mistaken
for serious suggestions.

58:15.871 --> 58:20.876
I do like a, um,
tightly stuffed vine leaf.

58:22.144 --> 58:24.079
Hey. Took him a while,

58:24.213 --> 58:25.781
but he's settling down now.

58:27.783 --> 58:29.718
- Beautiful creatures.
- Yeah.

58:29.852 --> 58:31.720
- I love their hair.
- Yeah.

58:31.854 --> 58:34.823
The mane is actually connected
to sexual selection.

58:34.957 --> 58:37.593
- There it is, mate, right there.
- Heh-heh-heh.

58:37.726 --> 58:39.028
All right, mate, in a bit.

58:42.831 --> 58:45.234
You wanna fight? Or are you
like the Cowardly Lion

58:45.367 --> 58:46.969
from <i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

58:47.102 --> 58:50.039
Put them up. Put them up.

58:58.981 --> 59:01.450
I was reading about Oedipus
on Wikipedia.

59:01.685 --> 59:03.085
The way Sophocles intended.

59:04.987 --> 59:07.623
- Joke.
- It said he had to kill his dad

59:07.756 --> 59:10.926
because as a young man, he had
been the guest of another king

59:11.060 --> 59:13.229
and had violated
the laws of hospitality

59:13.362 --> 59:16.065
by abducting and raping a boy.

59:16.198 --> 59:19.235
And people say
<i>EastEnders</i> is dark.

59:22.805 --> 59:24.673
Amanda!

59:24.807 --> 59:27.142
- Here, you look exhausted.
- Oh, thanks.

59:27.276 --> 59:29.645
I'm knackered.

59:29.778 --> 59:34.283
We were, um, just talking about
Greek tragedy and... And stuff.

59:34.416 --> 59:35.951
How Oedipus killed his father

59:36.085 --> 59:39.255
as punishment for all
the terrible things he'd done.

59:39.388 --> 59:40.956
It's more about fate.

59:41.090 --> 59:44.526
Fate because he needs
to be killed.

59:44.760 --> 59:48.931
Oh, that was my skin.
You just poked my skin.

59:49.064 --> 59:51.200
I look ridiculous.

59:51.333 --> 59:53.269
- You don't.
- You look lovely.

59:53.402 --> 59:58.674
Yeah, you look like, uh,
Aphrodite's, uh, Irish granny.

59:58.807 --> 01:00:01.076
You always were
a show-off, Ricky.

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:03.879
I'm not doing it for me.
I'm doing it for everyone else.

01:00:04.013 --> 01:00:06.782
It's about showing me
and us respect.

01:00:06.915 --> 01:00:10.052
What is all this about?
Gladiators and lions and...

01:00:10.185 --> 01:00:11.920
What do you mean?
Bread and circuses.

01:00:12.054 --> 01:00:15.291
- What people want. They love it.
- It must be costing a fortune.

01:00:15.424 --> 01:00:17.860
It is. That's the whole point.

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:19.995
To show those bastards.

01:00:20.129 --> 01:00:22.298
Now, in 2012, you bought a yacht

01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:24.099
costing 100 million pounds.
Correct?

01:00:24.233 --> 01:00:26.535
Uh, bit more
after it was kitted out.

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:30.139
And your clothing lines are
endorsed by many celebrities.

01:00:30.272 --> 01:00:33.142
Uh, wealthy, beautiful people.

01:00:33.275 --> 01:00:36.979
And yet the workers in your
factories, 80 percent women,

01:00:37.112 --> 01:00:39.581
are paid $5 for a 12-hour day.

01:00:39.815 --> 01:00:41.850
I don't own any factories.

01:00:41.984 --> 01:00:43.986
I make a deal with the supplier.

01:00:44.119 --> 01:00:46.889
It's up to them how they,
uh, operate their factory.

01:00:47.022 --> 01:00:49.925
Right, but you're very happy
to use their factories.

01:00:50.059 --> 01:00:52.328
It's the market, with respect.

01:00:52.461 --> 01:00:54.296
It's, uh... You know,
the same factories

01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:59.134
are supplying Zara,
H&M, Marks and Spencers.

01:00:59.268 --> 01:01:02.838
- "Happy birthday, Sir Richard."
- Everyone smile. Yeah?

01:01:02.971 --> 01:01:04.073
Okay. Ready?

01:01:04.206 --> 01:01:06.175
And one, two, three.

01:01:06.308 --> 01:01:08.977
Happy birthday, Sir Richard!

01:01:09.111 --> 01:01:10.879
Yeah, great. I bought that.

01:01:13.048 --> 01:01:15.384
Hello? Are you filming?

01:01:15.517 --> 01:01:18.587
- Well, I'm writing a book.
- You're filming. Good story.

01:01:18.822 --> 01:01:20.956
- I don't have time. I'm sorry.
- Come and see.

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:23.592
Come and see where we live.
Come and see.

01:01:23.827 --> 01:01:27.129
Well, someone's picking me up
in a minute, but...

01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:34.103
- I live here.
- You live here?

01:01:34.236 --> 01:01:35.371
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:35.504 --> 01:01:38.107
More than hundred people live.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.777
More than a hundred people
live here? Right. Yeah.

01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:42.177
No running water.

01:01:42.311 --> 01:01:45.782
You use the well
instead of plumbing, right.

01:01:45.914 --> 01:01:47.817
How long have you lived here?

01:01:52.187 --> 01:01:54.022
- Fifteen years.
- Fifteen years.

01:01:54.156 --> 01:01:55.958
And how many hours a day
do you work?

01:01:59.228 --> 01:02:00.462
Twelve hours.

01:02:00.596 --> 01:02:04.133
How much do you get paid
for a 12-hour day?

01:02:10.339 --> 01:02:12.374
Eight hundred rupees.

01:02:12.508 --> 01:02:13.843
- Eight hundred?
- Yeah.

01:02:13.976 --> 01:02:16.445
That's less than
4 pounds a day, I think.

01:02:16.578 --> 01:02:18.447
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:02:33.262 --> 01:02:34.963
<i>Bellissimo.</i>

01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:39.368
Ah...

01:02:39.501 --> 01:02:42.137
Look at that.
You can't buy a view like that.

01:02:42.271 --> 01:02:43.939
Oh, wait, no, I have.

01:02:45.674 --> 01:02:48.243
What have
they got to sing about?

01:02:48.377 --> 01:02:51.413
Right. The look-alikes.

01:02:53.282 --> 01:02:55.417
I can't... I can't...
I can't see this.

01:02:55.551 --> 01:02:56.920
- It's too sunny.
- Oh, hang on.

01:02:57.052 --> 01:02:59.421
I've got some printouts. Here.

01:02:59.555 --> 01:03:01.056
George Clooney.

01:03:02.124 --> 01:03:03.158
He's having a laugh.

01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:05.227
It's just a bloke
with gray hair.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.130
Samuel L. Jackson. That's just
a black man in a curly wig.

01:03:08.263 --> 01:03:10.466
That's borderline racist.

01:03:10.599 --> 01:03:15.404
Adele. Yeah, she looks
like Adele. Johnny Depp.

01:03:15.537 --> 01:03:18.273
It's just a bloke
in a fucking pirate costume.

01:03:18.407 --> 01:03:20.275
We'll bring
special makeup artists in.

01:03:20.409 --> 01:03:22.244
You'll need
a fucking plastic surgeon.

01:03:22.377 --> 01:03:24.881
Heh, maybe it should be
a masked ball.

01:03:25.013 --> 01:03:26.749
Yeah? Who the fuck asked you?

01:03:26.982 --> 01:03:28.550
No. Sorry.
You're absolutely right.

01:03:28.685 --> 01:03:31.520
We need to go to the kitchen.
Chef's ready for that tasting.

01:03:31.653 --> 01:03:34.924
Oh, God.
What are you doing down here?

01:03:35.057 --> 01:03:37.727
The workers have stopped.
They've done seven days running.

01:03:37.961 --> 01:03:39.194
That's the maximum permitted.

01:03:39.328 --> 01:03:42.397
Fucking EU
fucking health and safety.

01:03:42.531 --> 01:03:44.433
They should be grateful
they're working,

01:03:44.566 --> 01:03:46.936
the state this country's in.
Pbbt!

01:03:47.069 --> 01:03:49.505
Right. Give me some Roman
costumes and a pack of cards.

01:03:49.638 --> 01:03:52.775
Do I have to do
everything myself?

01:03:58.647 --> 01:04:00.582
You want a cup of tea?

01:04:00.717 --> 01:04:03.418
- Oh, yeah. I'd love a cup of tea.
- Have a seat.

01:04:03.552 --> 01:04:06.154
- What do you got? Fruit?
- Yeah.

01:04:06.288 --> 01:04:08.190
Trying to keep regular.

01:04:09.258 --> 01:04:11.326
Counteract the fucking feta.

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:14.998
- Hello.
- Hello. Who's in charge?

01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:16.532
- It's this guy. This one.
- Who?

01:04:16.665 --> 01:04:18.667
- You in charge?
- You can talk to me.

01:04:18.801 --> 01:04:22.005
Okay, right, I want
to ask you a question. Uh...

01:04:22.137 --> 01:04:23.806
Are you a...?

01:04:24.039 --> 01:04:25.942
Are you a gambling man?
You like a wager?

01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:29.177
We came in so small boat.
That's big risk.

01:04:29.311 --> 01:04:32.782
Yes. Well, that's a good point.
Uh, I've got a proposal for you.

01:04:33.016 --> 01:04:34.449
All you have to do
is play my game.

01:04:34.583 --> 01:04:36.019
And if you win, I'll give...

01:04:36.151 --> 01:04:38.086
You can stay here,
do what the fuck you like.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.088
I'll give you $100,000 in cash.

01:04:40.222 --> 01:04:42.558
Spend it on yourself or your
people. Whatever you want.

01:04:42.692 --> 01:04:44.192
- And if I lose?
- Right.

01:04:44.326 --> 01:04:47.162
If you lose, you have to clear
off the beach,

01:04:47.296 --> 01:04:49.531
and then you have to come work
for me, painting.

01:04:49.665 --> 01:04:51.466
And, uh, everyone here
has to dress up

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.136
in these clothes at my party.

01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:57.974
- What's your game?
- It's called Find the Lady.

01:04:58.106 --> 01:05:00.342
- Right? Come. Come here.
- Find the Lady.

01:05:02.144 --> 01:05:04.313
Come here.
Let's play Find the Lady.

01:05:06.816 --> 01:05:10.687
Right. All you gotta do
is keep your eye on the queen.

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:13.690
Okay, do you want to do
a trial run, uh, with Melanie?

01:05:13.823 --> 01:05:15.424
- A trial run...
- No, thank you.

01:05:15.557 --> 01:05:18.061
- We can do it with Sherine.
- All right, sweetheart.

01:05:18.193 --> 01:05:21.330
Uh, all you gotta do is keep
your eye on the queen. Right?

01:05:22.732 --> 01:05:24.566
All right, she's moving,
she's grooving,

01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:26.635
she's moving, she's grooving,
she's moving.

01:05:26.769 --> 01:05:28.537
Can you find the lady?

01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:34.343
Ah, she did it! All right.

01:05:36.779 --> 01:05:38.848
- Well done.
- Maybe we are more clever.

01:05:39.082 --> 01:05:42.384
Yeah, maybe. Okay, your turn.
There's a queen.

01:05:44.821 --> 01:05:47.456
She's moving, she's grooving,
she's moving, she's grooving,

01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:49.424
she's moving, she's grooving.

01:05:49.558 --> 01:05:51.326
Okay. Find the lady.

01:05:55.732 --> 01:05:58.333
- The one in the right.
- Sure you don't mean the middle?

01:05:58.467 --> 01:06:00.202
No, I told you,
the one on the right.

01:06:00.335 --> 01:06:02.137
All right. All right.

01:06:06.809 --> 01:06:10.113
Oh, and it was the middle one
too. Tried to help you.

01:06:10.245 --> 01:06:12.381
Never mind. That's the way
the cookie crumbles.

01:06:12.514 --> 01:06:14.684
All right, go do painting.
You go with Melanie.

01:06:14.817 --> 01:06:16.451
Clean all this crap
off the beach.

01:06:16.585 --> 01:06:18.553
- Whoa, you tricked us, man.
- No, no, no, mate.

01:06:18.688 --> 01:06:22.224
It's a wager.
Some you win, some you lose.

01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:24.127
Then how much you pay for us?

01:06:24.259 --> 01:06:25.728
I didn't mention anything
about money.

01:06:25.862 --> 01:06:27.096
It's work, man.

01:06:27.229 --> 01:06:28.664
What's the minimum wage
in Greece?

01:06:28.798 --> 01:06:31.400
- Five euros.
- Five euros an hour. Not bad.

01:06:31.533 --> 01:06:34.569
- And we wear this costume?
- Yeah, our guests are arriving.

01:06:34.704 --> 01:06:37.439
- You need to look like them.
- Why do we need to wear it?

01:06:37.572 --> 01:06:39.942
We all have to wear them.
All the workers.

01:07:21.951 --> 01:07:27.322
- Hey, Amanda. How's it going?
- I'm a slave. What do you think?

01:07:27.456 --> 01:07:30.459
Right. Well, slaves can
always revolt.

01:07:30.592 --> 01:07:32.527
If we've learned
nothing else from Brexit,

01:07:32.661 --> 01:07:34.197
and I'd argue that we haven't,

01:07:34.329 --> 01:07:36.565
it's that the voice
of the dissatisfied underclass

01:07:36.699 --> 01:07:38.300
can still make itself heard.

01:07:38.433 --> 01:07:40.703
Shut up, Nick.

01:07:40.837 --> 01:07:44.306
No, yeah, f-f-fair comment.

01:07:45.808 --> 01:07:48.543
- Are you okay?
- No.

01:07:48.678 --> 01:07:52.314
Right, look. Look. Do you wanna
come in here a minute? Just...

01:07:52.447 --> 01:07:57.552
- Thanks.
- H-h-have a seat. Um...

01:07:57.687 --> 01:08:02.257
And, look, do... Do you
wanna tell me what's wrong?

01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:06.461
Or it's fine
if you don't want to.

01:08:06.595 --> 01:08:08.463
You know I told you
about my aunt working

01:08:08.597 --> 01:08:10.733
- in that factory in Colombo?
- Yeah.

01:08:10.867 --> 01:08:13.335
Well, my mum worked
with her too.

01:08:13.468 --> 01:08:17.572
<i>They made clothes for lots
of different brands,</i>

01:08:17.707 --> 01:08:19.841
<i>including McCreadie.</i>

01:08:19.975 --> 01:08:23.813
<i>You know what he's like.
He drives a hard bargain.</i>

01:08:23.946 --> 01:08:25.782
<i>Everyone does.</i>

01:08:27.515 --> 01:08:29.484
- How much for this?
- It's $10.

01:08:29.618 --> 01:08:30.819
Fuck off.

01:08:30.953 --> 01:08:33.654
- Have I got a handle on my head?
- What?

01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:37.026
Have I got a handle
on the side of my head?

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.359
What?

01:08:38.493 --> 01:08:40.062
I'm asking you
in a very clever way

01:08:40.295 --> 01:08:43.631
if I look like a fucking mug.

01:08:43.765 --> 01:08:47.837
<i>Every year, there would be
pressure to reduce prices.</i>

01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:49.437
<i>If the price goes down,</i>

01:08:49.571 --> 01:08:51.841
<i>the factory still
has to make money.</i>

01:08:53.943 --> 01:08:55.912
- Everything okay, sir?
- Excellent, thank you.

01:08:56.045 --> 01:08:57.712
I might even give you a tip.

01:08:57.846 --> 01:09:00.216
<i>So, what happens?</i>

01:09:02.651 --> 01:09:05.054
<i>The workers have
to work faster.</i>

01:09:10.591 --> 01:09:13.796
<i>My mum wasn't fast enough
for the new targets.</i>

01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:17.233
<i>So when she got ill, they took
their chance and sacked her.</i>

01:09:42.624 --> 01:09:45.328
<i>Well, she got a job
in another place,</i>

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.729
<i>but it was a right dump.</i>

01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:51.399
It was overcrowded and noisy.

01:09:57.155 --> 01:09:58.115
Fire!

01:09:58.198 --> 01:09:59.608
Fire!

01:11:14.917 --> 01:11:16.852
My mum suffocated.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.055
Oh, God.

01:11:20.122 --> 01:11:22.590
That's why I came to England.

01:11:22.725 --> 01:11:24.860
And now look at me.

01:11:24.994 --> 01:11:27.396
I'm Greedy McCreadie's slave,

01:11:27.529 --> 01:11:30.565
working at
this ridiculous party.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.905
You're only dressed
as his slave. You...

01:11:36.038 --> 01:11:38.207
You're not actually a slave.

01:11:38.441 --> 01:11:40.409
When you bought Monda,

01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:43.412
it was part of
the Ethical Trading Initiative.

01:11:43.545 --> 01:11:45.982
- You pulled it out.
- Waste of time.

01:11:46.115 --> 01:11:47.750
Would you care
to expand on that?

01:11:47.883 --> 01:11:51.053
It's a colossal waste of time.

01:11:54.489 --> 01:11:55.691
Excuse me.

01:11:55.825 --> 01:11:57.426
Is this part of
forensic evidence?

01:11:57.559 --> 01:11:59.594
- No, sir.
- Then why the stinking fuck

01:11:59.729 --> 01:12:01.430
is it covered in fingerprints?

01:12:01.563 --> 01:12:03.966
Fucking clean this, or it'll
become forensic evidence

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.633
in your murder investigation.

01:12:05.768 --> 01:12:06.902
No more marks on glasses,

01:12:07.036 --> 01:12:08.738
or I'll shove them
up your asses.

01:12:08.871 --> 01:12:10.439
Keith Richards is late.

01:12:10.572 --> 01:12:12.274
You'd better mean late
as in "dead."

01:12:12.507 --> 01:12:14.609
He's on his way.
He's just delayed in Athens.

01:12:14.744 --> 01:12:17.880
I'm not paying
that fossilized shit goblin

01:12:18.014 --> 01:12:19.715
$800,000 to be fashionably late.

01:12:19.849 --> 01:12:21.484
I'm paying him a dollar
a wrinkle

01:12:21.616 --> 01:12:24.920
to show that elephant scrotum
he calls a face at my party.

01:12:25.054 --> 01:12:26.956
- I've broken this. Look at that.
- Oh, what?

01:12:27.089 --> 01:12:28.891
Stems are made of shit.

01:12:29.025 --> 01:12:32.461
Can we get that sorted, please?
Take that off. Thanks.

01:12:32.594 --> 01:12:34.529
- What's his excuse?
- I don't know.

01:12:34.662 --> 01:12:36.664
It's your job to know.

01:12:36.799 --> 01:12:39.702
It's a know job. Don't say
that's sexual harassment

01:12:39.835 --> 01:12:41.303
because it rhymes
with "blow job."

01:12:41.536 --> 01:12:43.538
Call Keith Richards' handlers
and tell them

01:12:43.671 --> 01:12:44.840
I want him here in one hour

01:12:44.974 --> 01:12:46.574
grinning like a tramp
who's won the lottery,

01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:48.010
which is basically what he is.

01:12:48.144 --> 01:12:51.080
Guys, you go now.
You need to go. Out of here.

01:12:58.521 --> 01:13:00.089
What's going on?
Oi, what's going on?

01:13:00.222 --> 01:13:02.691
It's the refugees.
They're slowing everything down.

01:13:02.825 --> 01:13:06.128
Tell them to get out.
It's not their party.

01:13:06.262 --> 01:13:08.898
Soup kitchen's over!
Back to work!

01:13:10.933 --> 01:13:12.968
Hey, look. Just calm down.

01:13:13.102 --> 01:13:15.104
Just calm down.
I'll deal with it.

01:13:15.237 --> 01:13:17.073
- Demetrious, stop shouting.
- Tell them to go!

01:13:17.206 --> 01:13:19.641
Tell them to leave the food
and go, please!

01:13:19.775 --> 01:13:22.144
- Amanda. Amanda.
- Come on. Come on, you.

01:13:22.278 --> 01:13:24.046
- You ready to go out and work?
- Amanda.

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.915
- Was that tasty?
- Get them out of here!

01:13:26.048 --> 01:13:29.185
There's about five or six
of them. I'll introduce you now.

01:13:29.318 --> 01:13:31.020
Make sure
they don't talk to anyone.

01:13:31.153 --> 01:13:32.855
I once had
a Gary Glitter look-alike

01:13:32.988 --> 01:13:34.757
who just kept bothering people.

01:13:34.890 --> 01:13:36.826
Can't get arrested now.

01:13:36.959 --> 01:13:38.994
Not something that was
a problem for Gary.

01:13:39.128 --> 01:13:41.497
Hey, everyone. Sir Richard.

01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:42.565
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:13:42.698 --> 01:13:43.833
- Hello.
- Hi, Sir Richard.

01:13:43.966 --> 01:13:45.901
Yep, Simon Cowell. He's good.

01:13:46.035 --> 01:13:47.870
- Yeah, Simon Cowell there.
- Who are you?

01:13:48.003 --> 01:13:50.005
- Adele.
- Course you are. Yeah.

01:13:50.139 --> 01:13:53.542
- Who's the guy with the bandana?
- It's Rod Stewart.

01:13:53.676 --> 01:13:57.146
Looks like Rod Stewart's
bitter older brother.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.082
And who's she?

01:14:00.216 --> 01:14:03.853
- Kylie.
- Kylie Minogue.

01:14:03.986 --> 01:14:07.323
At a push. She'll have
to wear a name badge.

01:14:09.024 --> 01:14:11.760
- Is that George Michael?
- He's amazing.

01:14:11.894 --> 01:14:14.163
Apparently, he can sing as well.

01:14:14.296 --> 01:14:16.599
George Michael's fucking dead.

01:14:16.732 --> 01:14:19.101
I think the agency sent anyone
they had on their books.

01:14:19.235 --> 01:14:21.103
Well, put the ghost
of George Michael

01:14:21.237 --> 01:14:22.872
back on a plane
to Club Tropicana.

01:14:23.005 --> 01:14:24.240
Drinks are not free for him.

01:14:24.373 --> 01:14:27.009
I'm tired of these
cheeky Greek chancers.

01:14:37.319 --> 01:14:38.954
Great.

01:14:39.088 --> 01:14:42.725
Oh, and I want the AC set
at 68 degrees in every room.

01:14:42.858 --> 01:14:44.593
I was at Gareth's party.
It failed

01:14:44.727 --> 01:14:46.661
and the pillow chocolates
melted.

01:14:46.795 --> 01:14:49.298
Looked like the tooth fairy
was having a dirty protest.

01:14:59.408 --> 01:15:04.013
- Babe, how do I look?
- You look gorgeous.

01:15:13.222 --> 01:15:16.258
"My name is
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

01:15:16.392 --> 01:15:19.161
commander of
the Armies of the North."

01:15:19.295 --> 01:15:21.163
Yeah? Keep going.

01:15:21.297 --> 01:15:23.933
"General of the Felix Legions,

01:15:24.066 --> 01:15:26.869
loyal servant
to the true emperor,"

01:15:27.002 --> 01:15:28.904
Richus Greedus.

01:15:29.038 --> 01:15:34.678
"Father to a murdered son,
husband to a murdered wife."

01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:36.680
Go south to my troops.

01:15:38.847 --> 01:15:39.848
What?!

01:15:41.183 --> 01:15:42.985
It's Finn. I...

01:15:43.118 --> 01:15:45.120
- I've got you a present.
- Go away!

01:15:52.228 --> 01:15:54.096
- Go on. Keep going.
- Okay. Um...

01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:56.799
"My name is
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

01:15:56.932 --> 01:15:59.868
- commander of the Armies..."
- Wait. Sorry. I've gone soft.

01:16:00.002 --> 01:16:01.203
I've gone soft.

01:16:01.337 --> 01:16:02.972
- Oh, Finn.
- He's ruined it.

01:16:03.105 --> 01:16:04.306
- Sorry.
- Oh, fine.

01:16:21.957 --> 01:16:23.292
You look like the goddess
Aphrodite

01:16:23.425 --> 01:16:24.893
rising up from the spume,

01:16:25.027 --> 01:16:27.663
only much, much lovelier.

01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:29.498
Did Roman women wear stilettos?

01:16:29.733 --> 01:16:31.367
So you're excited
about the party, yeah?

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.136
- I'm excited about Daddy's party.
- Great. Great.

01:16:42.244 --> 01:16:43.946
Cheers.

01:16:44.079 --> 01:16:46.750
Hey. There you go.
Oh, you're here, finally.

01:16:46.882 --> 01:16:48.951
Adrian. Fucking hell, mate.

01:16:49.084 --> 01:16:50.552
- You look great.
- You look fantastic.

01:16:50.786 --> 01:16:52.756
You look like
a gladiator already.

01:16:52.888 --> 01:16:55.391
You look like
a smashing slave boy.

01:16:55.524 --> 01:16:59.261
Ladies and gentlemen, I think
we all know why we are here.

01:16:59.395 --> 01:17:01.563
We are here
to celebrate the birthday

01:17:01.797 --> 01:17:05.200
of a self-made man
who worships his creator.

01:17:05.334 --> 01:17:08.971
In fact, once the youngest
self-made billionaire

01:17:09.104 --> 01:17:11.240
in British history, he is now

01:17:11.373 --> 01:17:13.208
virtually Britain's oldest man.

01:17:13.342 --> 01:17:14.744
Despite the fact
that we're here

01:17:14.877 --> 01:17:16.211
to celebrate his 60th birthday,

01:17:16.345 --> 01:17:18.180
Sir Richard still has
his own hips,

01:17:18.314 --> 01:17:20.784
his own teeth.
At least I think they're teeth.

01:17:20.916 --> 01:17:23.152
They're something vaguely
resembling teeth, at any rate.

01:17:23.285 --> 01:17:26.155
And thank goodness, of course,
he has his own marbles.

01:17:26.288 --> 01:17:27.923
Uh, which,
in true British fashion,

01:17:28.057 --> 01:17:29.558
he stole from the Parthenon.

01:17:29.793 --> 01:17:31.795
Cue the VT.

01:17:31.927 --> 01:17:33.329
Cue the VT.

01:17:33.462 --> 01:17:36.432

We're trying to film
a romantic scene.

I feel like I'm

Yeah, and we're the mechanicals.

- Fancy bumping into you here.

01:20:16.024 --> 01:20:17.526
Good night, Sir Stephen.

01:20:17.659 --> 01:20:20.295
It's just Stephen.
I'm not a knight.

01:20:20.429 --> 01:20:23.365
Aren't you? My son is.

01:20:23.499 --> 01:20:26.201
Yes. Yes, he is.

01:20:30.272 --> 01:20:32.140
I need to see what's in the bag.

01:20:32.274 --> 01:20:33.910
These are our things.
Give me the bag.

01:20:34.042 --> 01:20:35.310
- Hey!
- Come on, give me!

01:20:35.444 --> 01:20:37.012
- What's going on?
- Call the police.

01:20:37.145 --> 01:20:38.547
These bastards
have been stealing!

01:20:38.681 --> 01:20:40.282
- They're just children.
- Go!

01:20:41.517 --> 01:20:43.619
Stop! Call the police.

01:20:43.753 --> 01:20:46.923
- I'm not calling the police.
- Stop! Stop it! Come back!

01:20:47.055 --> 01:20:48.758
- Stop!
- Shit. Hey!

01:20:55.297 --> 01:20:56.799
Come back!

01:21:00.269 --> 01:21:01.971
- Run!
- Stop! Stop! Stop it!

01:21:09.111 --> 01:21:10.579
Hey, hey. Oi.
Put the camera down.

01:21:10.713 --> 01:21:13.615
Put the camera down,
you sneaky little wanker.

01:21:15.785 --> 01:21:17.586
- Stop!
- Hey!

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.354
Stop!

01:21:19.488 --> 01:21:21.557
Stop! Stop!

01:21:24.359 --> 01:21:25.828
Stop! Stop, stop!

01:21:27.764 --> 01:21:31.099
They stole our cutlery.

01:21:31.233 --> 01:21:33.101
- Hey, stop it!
- Calm down, stop.

01:21:33.235 --> 01:21:35.370
- They need to bring it back.
- No worry, no worry.

01:21:35.504 --> 01:21:37.573
They need to give... It's our...

01:21:43.412 --> 01:21:46.248
I told you stop! Stop!

01:21:48.216 --> 01:21:53.255
Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop it!

01:21:53.388 --> 01:21:56.458
- Did you call the police?
- No, I didn't. They're just kids.

01:21:56.592 --> 01:21:59.161
We are fucking human.
We don't need that again.

01:21:59.294 --> 01:22:00.529
No, I know. I know.

01:22:02.765 --> 01:22:04.701
Kareem. Kareem, listen, please.

01:22:04.834 --> 01:22:08.270
We don't need to listen.
We don't need to listen.

01:22:08.403 --> 01:22:10.572
It's the last.
We don't need to talk anymore.

01:22:10.707 --> 01:22:14.576
That's finished.
We are going to go home now.

01:22:17.379 --> 01:22:19.214
It's nice they can be friends.

01:22:19.348 --> 01:22:21.084
I mean, they're the same age,
after all.

01:22:21.216 --> 01:22:22.384
Yeah, all right.

01:22:29.324 --> 01:22:30.359
All right. Time-out.

01:22:36.632 --> 01:22:38.868
All right, sunshine,
time for you to go to bed.

01:22:39.102 --> 01:22:40.469
Fuck off, Dad.

01:22:40.602 --> 01:22:41.838
Go to bed.

01:22:43.106 --> 01:22:44.406
Get!

01:22:47.643 --> 01:22:48.678
Finn.

01:22:52.247 --> 01:22:53.582
Hi!

01:23:03.325 --> 01:23:06.428
Kareem, I just...
I wanna help. I'm on your side.

01:23:06.561 --> 01:23:08.430
What help you talking about
all the time?

01:23:08.563 --> 01:23:11.400
Fighting isn't
gonna solve anything.

01:23:13.435 --> 01:23:15.071
Look, Kareem.

01:23:17.472 --> 01:23:20.275
- The police will come, for sure.
- Really? We are not thieves.

01:23:20.409 --> 01:23:22.779
I know, but the children,
they've got the cutlery.

01:23:22.912 --> 01:23:24.312
Haven't you?

01:23:24.446 --> 01:23:26.281
Do you wanna arrest them?

01:23:26.415 --> 01:23:28.151
Do you wanna put them in prison?

01:23:28.283 --> 01:23:31.253
Even they lost
their father and their mother?

01:23:31.386 --> 01:23:33.588
You know, Sherine's mum
is my sister in Syria.

01:23:33.723 --> 01:23:35.692
I promised her
that I would look after her.

01:23:35.825 --> 01:23:39.361
- Look at us now, we are slaves.
- I know. I know, Kareem.

01:23:39.494 --> 01:23:42.230
If they keep the silver,
they're gonna get into trouble

01:23:42.364 --> 01:23:44.701
and that isn't gonna help them.

01:23:48.904 --> 01:23:51.573
I'm going to ask you a question.
Answer honestly.

01:23:51.657 --> 01:23:54.660
Do you have the cutlery?

01:23:56.578 --> 01:23:57.746
Be honest, do you have it?

01:23:58.997 --> 01:24:00.499
Give it to me.

01:24:07.089 --> 01:24:09.883
I can forgive you.

01:24:13.863 --> 01:24:16.298
- Here's your silver.
- Thanks, Kareem.

01:24:35.985 --> 01:24:37.419
Clarence.

01:24:38.487 --> 01:24:41.356
Clarence! Come here.

01:24:44.559 --> 01:24:46.495
Shh! Wanna try some of this?

01:24:46.628 --> 01:24:48.296
Oi! What are you doing?

01:24:50.398 --> 01:24:51.333
Fucking Arab!

01:24:51.466 --> 01:24:53.770
Fuck off!

01:24:53.903 --> 01:24:54.837
You all right, boy?

01:24:57.339 --> 01:25:00.275
Oh, now you wanna eat. Typical.

01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:02.779
Bloody Arabs.

01:25:02.912 --> 01:25:04.312
Hey.

01:25:04.446 --> 01:25:05.848
- You guys want some champagne?
- Hey.

01:25:05.982 --> 01:25:07.549
- No, thank you.
- Yeah, why not?

01:25:07.683 --> 01:25:09.351
- Come on.
- See you in our suite.

01:25:09.484 --> 01:25:11.386
I want to shower and freshen up.

01:25:13.022 --> 01:25:14.422
- Don't be too long.
- Right.

01:25:14.556 --> 01:25:18.560
- Good night, Naomi.
- Good night, Samantha.

01:25:18.694 --> 01:25:22.732
So, what's
a pretty little thing like you

01:25:22.865 --> 01:25:24.700
doing all alone
on a night like this?

01:25:26.501 --> 01:25:29.437
- Francois went to bed.
- Did he?

01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:32.641
Was thinking
of going for a walk.

01:25:32.775 --> 01:25:34.877
Why don't you tag along?

01:25:35.011 --> 01:25:36.746
I'm so tired, I'm gonna sleep

01:25:36.879 --> 01:25:38.881
- until <i>my</i> 60th.
- Come on.

01:25:40.515 --> 01:25:42.517
Which, as you know,
is 40 years away.

01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:45.688
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

01:25:45.822 --> 01:25:46.756
Good night.

01:25:58.301 --> 01:25:59.434
Grow up.

01:25:59.568 --> 01:26:02.772
- I'll be along in a minute.
- No, you won't.

01:26:02.905 --> 01:26:04.406
Yeah.

01:26:10.913 --> 01:26:12.949
Hey. It's all right.

01:26:15.318 --> 01:26:16.618
Shh, shh, shh.

01:26:19.055 --> 01:26:20.790
You all right, mate?

01:26:32.534 --> 01:26:37.539
"I knew a man who once said,
'Death smiles at us all.

01:26:38.808 --> 01:26:41.543
All a man can do
is smile back.'"

01:26:43.045 --> 01:26:45.380
You seen <i>Gladiator?</i>

01:26:45.513 --> 01:26:46.682
"When a man sees his end...

01:26:48.450 --> 01:26:51.854
...he knows there must be
some reason to his life.

01:26:51.988 --> 01:26:54.957
How will the world speak my name
in the years to come?

01:26:56.959 --> 01:27:00.629
Will I be known
as a philosopher,

01:27:00.763 --> 01:27:02.497
a warrior,

01:27:02.631 --> 01:27:04.532
or a tyrant?"

01:27:09.005 --> 01:27:10.438
What's the matter, Clarence?

01:27:12.041 --> 01:27:14.343
Fucking hell. All right, mate,
I'm on your side.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.763
I'm not afraid.
I've never been afraid.

01:27:38.667 --> 01:27:40.669
You can smell that, can't you?

01:27:40.803 --> 01:27:43.538
You can smell that I'm brave.

01:27:43.672 --> 01:27:45.440
I'm like you.

01:27:46.842 --> 01:27:49.679
I'm a lion. A lion king.

01:27:52.148 --> 01:27:53.215
Lionheart.

01:27:54.516 --> 01:27:57.720
Richard the fucking Lionheart.

01:27:58.854 --> 01:28:00.089
All right. Just a trip.

01:28:01.424 --> 01:28:03.192
Look at me. I'm here.

01:28:03.426 --> 01:28:04.559
I'm not trying to escape.

01:28:06.195 --> 01:28:08.197
I love you.

01:28:08.431 --> 01:28:10.532
I respect you.

01:28:10.665 --> 01:28:12.868
But I don't fear you.

01:28:13.002 --> 01:28:16.839
I... fear nothing.

01:28:56.145 --> 01:28:57.512
Clarence!

01:29:06.989 --> 01:29:10.525
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

01:29:10.658 --> 01:29:14.063
Literally bloody hell!

01:29:16.732 --> 01:29:18.666
What are you gonna do?

01:29:19.769 --> 01:29:21.037
I don't know.

01:29:21.170 --> 01:29:22.938
I... I've never witnessed

01:29:23.072 --> 01:29:25.708
big-cat manslaughter before,
have I?

01:29:25.841 --> 01:29:28.044
I've gotta go.

01:29:34.984 --> 01:29:36.285
Clarence!

01:29:50.966 --> 01:29:53.002
Oh, shit.

01:29:58.908 --> 01:30:01.911
Ambulance. We need...
We need an ambulance.

01:30:03.611 --> 01:30:07.683
To the amphitheater.
Ambulance now!

01:30:07.817 --> 01:30:10.585
- Sorry. I must have overslept.
- Fuck off, Keith!

01:30:10.719 --> 01:30:12.221
Did I miss something?

01:30:43.886 --> 01:30:46.388

<i>I suppose I did get to know him

- Bring up one next.
- <i>What will his legacy be?</i>

01:32:03.899 --> 01:32:06.869
<i>Well, he was famous, of course,
as the king of the high street,</i>

01:32:07.002 --> 01:32:08.871
<i>but he was
so many other things.</i>

01:32:09.004 --> 01:32:10.706
<i>What was he like as a man?</i>

01:32:10.839 --> 01:32:13.742
<i>He was very proud
of his immigrant roots.</i>

01:32:13.876 --> 01:32:16.445
<i>He was incredibly hard-working.
Very direct.</i>

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:18.881
<i>Didn't suffer fools gladly.</i>

01:32:19.014 --> 01:32:20.916
<i>What do you think made him
so successful?</i>

01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:22.985
<i>He wanted to win.</i>

01:32:23.118 --> 01:32:25.321
<i>He believed
that winning was everything.</i>

01:32:25.454 --> 01:32:27.022
- Three next.
- <i>And he was willing</i>

01:32:27.156 --> 01:32:29.124
<i>to do anything
in order to win.</i>

01:32:29.258 --> 01:32:30.993
- And three.
- <i>Did he go too far, though,</i>

01:32:31.126 --> 01:32:33.963
- <i>in his desire to win?</i>
- <i>I suppose he felt</i>

01:32:34.096 --> 01:32:36.298
<i>that if you want to win,
you have to be ruthless.</i>

01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:50.479
We're in close-up.

01:32:50.714 --> 01:32:53.182

Morning.

01:33:30.252 --> 01:33:34.223
- Um, I'm here to see Amanda.
- I know.

01:33:34.356 --> 01:33:36.925
I know why you're here.

01:33:37.059 --> 01:33:40.329
She's a good girl.
I want you to know that.

01:33:40.462 --> 01:33:43.165
I know. That's why I've come.

01:33:43.299 --> 01:33:44.800
She's lived with
me since she was 7.

01:33:44.933 --> 01:33:46.268
Thanks.

01:33:47.936 --> 01:33:50.072
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:33:50.205 --> 01:33:54.143
I, uh, have to, uh,
go upstairs, do something.

01:33:54.276 --> 01:33:57.212
- Nice to meet you.
- And you. Yeah.

01:33:57.346 --> 01:34:00.149
Look, I'm sorry I'm late.
Uh, my train was delayed.

01:34:00.282 --> 01:34:02.051
- I saw you on telly.
- Right.

01:34:02.184 --> 01:34:04.019
My eulogy.

01:34:04.153 --> 01:34:07.323
You were good. Very convincing.

01:34:07.456 --> 01:34:09.291
- Sorry.
- Why sorry?

01:34:09.425 --> 01:34:12.762
I'm writing a book about him,
making money out of it.

01:34:12.895 --> 01:34:16.165
Well, it's not gonna be
the unvarnished truth, is it?

01:34:16.298 --> 01:34:20.936
Look, I've gotta go. I've gotta
work. Gotta pay the bills.

01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:24.907
- Is it okay if I walk with you?
- Sure.

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.442
It's just around the corner.

01:34:26.575 --> 01:34:28.911
I used to work there
in the holidays.

01:34:29.044 --> 01:34:31.847
- To Rich.
- To Rich.

01:34:37.052 --> 01:34:39.021
I'm just gonna say a few words.

01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:44.059
This is me.
This is where I'm working.

01:34:44.193 --> 01:34:47.797
Well, bye, then.

01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:50.899
You know, the funny thing is,
when I pushed that button,

01:34:51.033 --> 01:34:53.135
I didn't feel it was me.

01:34:53.268 --> 01:34:55.170
I wasn't responsible.

01:34:55.304 --> 01:34:58.107
It was fate operating
through you.

01:34:59.274 --> 01:35:00.476
Maybe.

01:35:00.609 --> 01:35:03.612
My hand moved.
Then the gate moved.

01:35:03.847 --> 01:35:06.415
Then the lion moved.
Then McCreadie moved.

01:35:06.548 --> 01:35:08.217
They were separate events.

01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:11.987
Rich knew that, uh...
That legacy was important.

01:35:12.121 --> 01:35:15.457
That it was important to leave
your business in good hands.

01:35:15.591 --> 01:35:17.827
In the hands
of the next generation.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:20.129
Now, Rich and I were
the trailblazers,

01:35:20.262 --> 01:35:25.367
but you, Lily, Adrian, Finn,

01:35:25.501 --> 01:35:29.972
you will guide Monda
into a new golden age.

01:35:34.176 --> 01:35:36.512
Just gonna say a few words.
Just a few words.

01:35:36.645 --> 01:35:38.647
Ahem. Hello.

01:35:38.882 --> 01:35:40.516
It was a bit like McCreadie
paying less

01:35:40.649 --> 01:35:44.286
for an item of clothing
so people have to work faster.

01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.288
So some of them lose their jobs.

01:35:46.422 --> 01:35:48.924
So they can't feed
their children.

01:35:49.057 --> 01:35:52.361
He didn't feel it was his fault.
He just offered them a price.

01:35:54.129 --> 01:35:55.130
Yeah.

01:35:57.966 --> 01:35:59.268
I better go.

01:36:03.405 --> 01:36:04.440
Bye, then.

01:36:06.341 --> 01:36:07.609
Bye.

01:36:19.188 --> 01:36:20.924
<i>My dad had big shoes to fill.</i>

01:36:21.056 --> 01:36:22.391
I mean, literally. Heh.

01:36:22.524 --> 01:36:24.694
As he would often point out,

01:36:24.928 --> 01:36:26.696
his feet were two sizes
bigger than mine.

01:36:28.297 --> 01:36:29.866
He had big feet. Even the lion

01:36:29.998 --> 01:36:31.099
couldn't finish them off.

01:36:34.704 --> 01:36:38.708
I believe that we're going
to build an empire

01:36:38.942 --> 01:36:41.276
two sizes bigger

01:36:41.410 --> 01:36:44.446
than any the world of
retail fashion has seen before.

01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:47.015
Move over, H&M.

01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:48.217
Watch out, Zara.

01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:50.552
We are gonna be hotter,

01:36:50.687 --> 01:36:54.456
cooler, faster and cheaper.

01:36:55.959 --> 01:36:58.093
We're gonna slaughter them
out there.
