00:00.020 --> 00:01.946
Once you are married,
everything Desna has

00:01.987 --> 00:03.820
will be community property.

00:03.822 --> 00:05.588
It's a sharing stick.

00:07.692 --> 00:08.758
Ted?

00:08.760 --> 00:09.892
Desna, I'm in.

00:09.894 --> 00:11.728
Find you the best salon in town.

00:11.730 --> 00:12.996
Thanks, Mandy.

00:12.998 --> 00:15.098
My mom just tried
to sell me to a stranger.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.733
I know, sugar. But I've got you.

00:16.735 --> 00:19.335
The Dixie Mafia, they're coming
after you next week.

00:19.337 --> 00:22.105
I'm getting played. By Zlata and Gregory.

00:22.107 --> 00:24.974
We will destroy their supply.

00:24.976 --> 00:26.542
That'll hurt both of they asses.

00:26.544 --> 00:28.478
Change of plans. We're taking the coke.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.247
Ruval is gonna think
a rival crew jacked his dope.

00:31.249 --> 00:32.515
You just keep getting us
deeper and deeper.

00:32.517 --> 00:35.018
What I'm tryin' to do is to get us all

00:35.020 --> 00:37.492
- out from underneath this shit.
- I'm out.

00:37.494 --> 00:39.155
250 kilos are gone.

00:39.157 --> 00:40.390
It better not be your men.

00:40.392 --> 00:41.491
What is this?

00:41.493 --> 00:43.226
You have something that belongs to me.

00:43.228 --> 00:46.696
If Ruval marries you, he gets
the license when you die.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.598
He was gonna kill me?

00:48.600 --> 00:50.333
No!

00:50.335 --> 00:52.302
You stay with me, Bryce Husser, okay?

00:52.304 --> 00:53.569
Hank, what are you doing here?

00:53.571 --> 00:55.371
- That's what friends do.
- We can't be friends.

00:55.373 --> 00:56.506
A wire?

00:56.508 --> 00:58.508
You want me to talk to them
while I wear a wire?

00:58.510 --> 01:00.710
- Wire returned.
- You gave us the bigger fish we needed.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.780
Desna Simms. You're under arrest
for money laundering and fraud.

01:03.782 --> 01:06.249
No, no! Desna!

01:07.552 --> 01:10.286
Uh, yeah, Desna Simms... S-I-M-M-S.

01:10.288 --> 01:11.788
She should've been brought
in about an hour ago.

01:13.058 --> 01:14.524
All right, thanks for checking, officer.

01:14.526 --> 01:16.259
Shit. I thought you were done with us.

01:16.261 --> 01:17.927
This is what I was worried about.

01:17.929 --> 01:19.295
I warned her this would happen.

01:19.297 --> 01:21.164
- Then why are you here?
- Desna's in trouble.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.366
Until we know what's up,
I'm here, so what's the deal?

01:23.368 --> 01:24.767
She's not at the Bradenton station

01:24.769 --> 01:25.868
and she's not at the Sheriff's.

01:25.870 --> 01:27.130
Hey, why don't you call Arlene?

01:27.132 --> 01:28.290
She might still have connects

01:28.315 --> 01:29.372
- in the department.
- Yeah.

01:29.374 --> 01:31.140
Dean, are you sure she was arrested?

01:31.142 --> 01:32.475
A-Absolutely positive.

01:32.477 --> 01:34.544
I-I know what an unmarked
police car looks like.

01:34.546 --> 01:37.080
- I-I watch SVU.
- Arlene's not picking up.

01:37.082 --> 01:38.648
We got clients coming in.
What are we gonna do?

01:38.650 --> 01:41.584
Until we know what's going on,
it's business as usual.

01:41.586 --> 01:43.086
No, it's not!

01:43.088 --> 01:44.620
I-I don't like this, Polly.
I don't like this.

01:44.622 --> 01:46.589
I don't like this, Polly.
I don't like it.

01:46.591 --> 01:48.624
Dean, we're gonna find her.
It's gonna be okay.

01:48.626 --> 01:50.126
H-How do you know it's gonna be okay?

01:50.128 --> 01:52.261
It's... It's not gonna be okay!

01:52.263 --> 01:54.931
Where's my sister, Ann?
Where's my sister, Ann?

01:54.933 --> 01:57.834
Where's my sister? Huh?

01:57.836 --> 01:59.669
I'll get him, y'all.

Talk to us now, and maybe we can
help you avoid trouble later.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.207
You know, money laundering's
some serious shit.

02:38.209 --> 02:40.042
You could go down for a long time, Desna.

02:40.044 --> 02:42.879
I'm not going down for nothing
'cause I didn't do nothing.

02:42.881 --> 02:44.847
Poke the bear, that's a smart idea.

02:44.849 --> 02:46.682
Weren't you fired?

02:46.684 --> 02:49.085
I'm on a joint task force
with the feds now.

02:49.087 --> 02:51.854
So you've been lying to Ann
this whole time.

02:51.856 --> 02:54.123
Focus on yourself.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.858
Your name was heard over a wire.

02:55.860 --> 02:58.494
Looks like you got fingers
in all sorts of dirty pies.

02:58.496 --> 03:02.398
We're talking 25, 30 years on a good day.

03:16.114 --> 03:19.081
Idiot.

03:19.083 --> 03:22.185
I treat Boris like king and he steals

03:22.187 --> 03:24.821
from Ruval like common Ukrainian.

03:24.823 --> 03:26.231
Traitor.

03:26.691 --> 03:30.126
Because of your mess,
I have to apologize to him

03:30.128 --> 03:32.195
and fall on the sword.

03:38.269 --> 03:39.602
- She got arrested?
- What?

03:39.604 --> 03:41.737
Yeah. Dean said it was an unmarked car.

03:41.739 --> 03:44.607
That could be cops,
that could be feds. I'm scared.

03:44.609 --> 03:46.676
Everything's gonna be fine,
Jenn, all right?

03:46.678 --> 03:49.045
The... The doc said
the surgery went well.

03:49.047 --> 03:50.947
Brienne stopped asking for black daddy.

03:50.949 --> 03:53.342
- She good?
- But we're both sober.

03:54.219 --> 03:55.818
- Okay, well, listen.
- Mm-hmm.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.487
You're gonna get all better
and then we're gonna

03:57.489 --> 03:59.722
- get out of here, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

03:59.724 --> 04:02.191
And maybe you can get back
to abundance coaching

04:02.193 --> 04:04.093
like you're so good at.

04:04.095 --> 04:05.862
Yeah. Give you a little TED Talk.

04:05.864 --> 04:08.231
Wait, wait, do...

04:09.067 --> 04:11.109
You really think I can do a TED Talk?

04:11.536 --> 04:13.769
Has Tony Robbins ever been shot?

04:13.771 --> 04:15.404
- He wishes.
- Yeah.

04:15.406 --> 04:17.373
Just blow him right in half.

04:17.375 --> 04:18.975
Okay, you know what?

04:18.976 --> 04:21.476
I'm gonna talk to the doctor
about easing off that morphine.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.312
- Uh-huh.
- Okay? Before I go to work.

04:23.314 --> 04:24.747
- Okay.
- All right, my love.

04:24.749 --> 04:25.791
Love you, baby.

04:26.851 --> 04:29.185
Um, I had an appointment
20 minutes ago with Desna.

04:29.187 --> 04:30.386
Where is she?

04:30.388 --> 04:31.420
- Church.
- Gyno.

04:31.422 --> 04:32.881
- Root canal.
- Seminar.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.424
You know, it's one of those
gynecological root canal

04:35.426 --> 04:38.261
in a church seminars.

04:38.263 --> 04:39.596
She's in jail.

04:40.832 --> 04:42.131
Dean!

04:42.133 --> 04:44.101
Come on, baby, I'll take you right here.

04:46.538 --> 04:48.237
Hey, sugar, you okay?

04:48.239 --> 04:50.172
I just got off the phone with my mom.

04:50.174 --> 04:51.908
She's coming to Palmetto.

04:51.910 --> 04:54.444
Oh, no. You're not gonna
see her, are you?

04:54.979 --> 04:57.146
She said she's changed.

04:57.148 --> 04:59.048
Sweetie, she is an addict

04:59.050 --> 05:03.120
who sold you for four Gucci purses.

05:03.988 --> 05:05.421
You're right.

05:05.423 --> 05:07.390
I'll tell my mom to back off.

05:07.392 --> 05:09.292
I can't handle seeing her anyway.

05:09.294 --> 05:11.027
That's a good idea.

05:11.029 --> 05:13.095
I made you some sneaky snacks.

05:13.097 --> 05:14.630
They're in the break room.

05:14.632 --> 05:16.198
I'll be there in a minute, okay?

05:18.236 --> 05:19.412
- Hello?
- Collect call

05:19.437 --> 05:20.521
from Palmetto County Jail.

05:20.523 --> 05:24.006
- Will you accept the charges?
- Yes, yes, I'll accept the charges.

05:24.008 --> 05:25.274
Pol?

05:25.276 --> 05:27.410
Oh! Desna, thank God. Are you okay?

05:27.412 --> 05:31.280
I need you to listen.
Don't talk, just listen.

05:31.282 --> 05:33.082
Okay, this shit is crazy.

05:33.084 --> 05:35.952
They saying that somebody
is wearing a wire.

05:35.954 --> 05:37.253
Oh, dear Lord in heaven.

05:37.255 --> 05:39.288
I need you to call your lawyer now.

05:39.290 --> 05:40.356
I-I can do that.

05:40.358 --> 05:41.958
I got you. Is Dean okay?

05:41.960 --> 05:43.826
Yeah, he's fine.
He's here in the salon with us.

05:43.828 --> 05:45.895
We didn't want him to be home alone.

05:45.897 --> 05:48.598
Okay, tell him I am fine, okay,

05:48.600 --> 05:50.417
and I'm gonna get out of this.

05:52.337 --> 05:53.603
Let's go.

05:53.605 --> 05:56.505
My time's up. Get your guy here.

05:57.755 --> 06:00.761
Pol, it's go time.

06:01.312 --> 06:04.213
Okay. We'll talk to you soon.

06:04.215 --> 06:05.932
She's fine.

06:06.718 --> 06:08.985
Let's go outside for a second.

06:13.558 --> 06:15.257
Wait, what the hell are we doing outside?

06:15.259 --> 06:17.059
Someone is wearing a wire.

06:17.061 --> 06:18.297
- What?
- For all we know,

06:18.322 --> 06:19.395
the place could be bugged.

06:19.397 --> 06:21.276
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

06:21.278 --> 06:23.009
Do you think it's somebody we know?

06:23.011 --> 06:25.267
It ain't me. Y'all would've peeped it.

06:25.269 --> 06:27.403
You're the one that's been
a little mad at Des.

06:27.405 --> 06:28.938
Don't... Don't... D-Don't go there.

06:28.940 --> 06:31.540
Y'all listen, if Des goes down,
we are right behind her.

06:31.542 --> 06:33.309
This is bad. This is really bad.

06:33.311 --> 06:34.610
No one is going anywhere.

06:34.612 --> 06:36.168
I've got my lawyer on this.

06:36.170 --> 06:38.280
Girl, the same lawyer who
couldn't keep you out of prison?

06:38.282 --> 06:39.548
She does have a point, Polly-Pol.

06:39.550 --> 06:41.083
This is our only choice.

06:41.085 --> 06:44.553
Y'all, Desna says it's go time.

06:44.555 --> 06:46.922
Shit. We got to start shredding
the bank statements.

06:46.924 --> 06:48.524
I'm gonna make sure the
appointment book looks legit.

06:48.526 --> 06:49.925
And I'm gonna get cash for the lawyer.

06:49.927 --> 06:51.293
We are gonna work this shit out.

06:51.295 --> 06:52.962
N-No, you're not.

06:52.964 --> 06:55.464
Y-You guys have been making
bad choices from the beginning.

06:55.466 --> 06:57.066
Now you're destroying evidence?!

06:57.068 --> 06:58.801
- Shh!
- That's obstruction!

06:58.803 --> 07:00.202
Haven't you been watching the news?

07:00.204 --> 07:01.604
- Dean! Dean!
- I'm sick of this.

07:01.606 --> 07:03.406
I'm... I'm gonna take
care of it on my own.

07:03.408 --> 07:06.575
What? Dean. Dean!

07:06.577 --> 07:09.037
Virginia! We have shit to do.

07:25.263 --> 07:27.029
Did you get a chance
to talk to your brother?

07:27.031 --> 07:30.433
You can't talk to me
until my lawyer gets here.

07:33.805 --> 07:35.871
I'm not here as a cop right now.

07:35.873 --> 07:40.142
Oh, what? You here as Ann's girlfriend?

07:40.144 --> 07:41.911
She'd hate to see you like this.

07:41.913 --> 07:43.112
All your friends would.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.981
'Cause you played Ann,
you think you know us?

07:45.983 --> 07:47.049
Bitch, you don't!

07:47.051 --> 07:48.718
I know how much your crew means to you.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.586
I know how much
your brother means to you.

07:50.588 --> 07:53.856
I know you being put away
would destroy them.

07:53.858 --> 07:56.726
You need to think very carefully
about what you do next,

07:56.728 --> 08:00.429
about what 25 years
in here will do to Dean.

08:00.431 --> 08:02.048
Who's gonna look after him?

08:03.401 --> 08:06.136
Who will take care of Dean?

08:07.672 --> 08:09.639
That's all I've been thinking about.

08:10.374 --> 08:12.225
Then let me help you.

08:15.313 --> 08:16.946
Transport's ready.

08:32.996 --> 08:35.530
I'm going! Damn!

08:44.475 --> 08:46.275
Hey, I need some wet wipes!

09:17.393 --> 09:19.559
When I was a lieutenant for a certain

09:19.561 --> 09:22.729
southern criminal organization,
I was shot.

09:22.731 --> 09:26.700
In fact, the bullet is still
lodged in my chest.

09:26.702 --> 09:30.337
I thought there was no way
I could rebuild my life.

09:30.339 --> 09:34.574
But by the power of embracing
what was in my heart,

09:34.576 --> 09:36.810
I was able to overcome my tragedy.

09:36.812 --> 09:40.614
Now, I want you to take
an audit of your life.

09:40.616 --> 09:43.441
What questionable choices have you made?

09:44.453 --> 09:46.528
What regrets do you have?

09:47.056 --> 09:49.990
How far did you fall?

09:49.992 --> 09:53.327
And how'd you lift
yourself up from adversity?

09:53.329 --> 09:56.963
By going deep in your wife.

09:59.668 --> 10:01.268
Don't hug me. Get the hell off my stage.

10:01.270 --> 10:03.236
- This is my talk.
- It's your talk. It's your talk.

10:03.238 --> 10:06.773
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is called static.

10:06.775 --> 10:09.576
When you are on your path
and you get derailed

10:09.578 --> 10:13.113
by adversity,
the solution is to stay focused

10:13.115 --> 10:14.414
and block out the noise.

10:14.416 --> 10:15.749
Let me enlighten you to the fine points

10:15.751 --> 10:17.684
of boning another man's wife.

10:17.686 --> 10:21.088
First, find someone who is lonely.

10:21.090 --> 10:24.257
My... My wife was not lonely.

10:24.259 --> 10:27.627
Then make sure her husband
is a weak-minded

10:27.629 --> 10:29.930
drug addict falling prey to temptation.

10:29.932 --> 10:32.165
What the hell are you talking about?

10:32.167 --> 10:34.935
Oh, while you were out getting
your gangster on,

10:34.937 --> 10:37.003
you weren't paying attention
to her needs.

10:37.005 --> 10:38.605
What?

10:38.607 --> 10:41.007
We just worked this shit out.
We just worked it out.

10:41.009 --> 10:43.710
I'm sure that's just
what she's telling you.

10:43.712 --> 10:45.679
I'm still tapping that ass.

10:45.681 --> 10:48.515
Ho!

10:50.519 --> 10:52.419
No.

11:03.699 --> 11:04.965
Don't you worry about Jenn.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.885
I'm gonna take real good care of her.

11:10.406 --> 11:11.938
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:11.940 --> 11:14.841
- What are you doing?
- Stay right there.

11:14.843 --> 11:17.911
I'm gonna be a better husband
and daddy than you ever were.

11:17.913 --> 11:19.346
I even know how to cornrow.

11:19.348 --> 11:21.114
What?

11:21.116 --> 11:22.949
Hey. No, no, no.

11:22.951 --> 11:26.319
Don't you dare touch her... hair.

11:29.658 --> 11:33.326
Hey. What they got you in here for?

11:33.328 --> 11:35.862
Check kiting? Identity theft?

11:35.864 --> 11:39.633
You did something.

11:39.635 --> 11:41.201
I don't want to talk about it.

11:41.203 --> 11:43.670
Oh, you all fancy now.

11:43.672 --> 11:45.739
Get used to it, bitch.

11:51.980 --> 11:54.581
- Mandy?
- Desna!

11:54.583 --> 11:55.949
How's Clint?

11:55.951 --> 11:57.784
Don't look at my nails. They're horrible.

11:57.786 --> 11:59.286
What the hell happened to you?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.122
You... You so thin.

12:02.124 --> 12:03.623
Thank you.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.792
I mean, I guess just a diet of cocaine

12:05.794 --> 12:08.195
and La Croix will do that for you.

12:08.197 --> 12:10.063
Why did you start doing blow, Mandy?

12:10.065 --> 12:12.199
Oh, you know, the constant pressure

12:12.201 --> 12:14.534
to make the commissions, to be that girl

12:14.536 --> 12:19.806
with that hair and that body
and those coral palazzo pants.

12:19.808 --> 12:21.107
I mean, it just got to me.

12:21.109 --> 12:24.177
Take your ass to therapy, huh?

12:24.179 --> 12:26.413
Work out, eat some chocolate.

12:26.415 --> 12:28.348
Hell, eat anything.

12:28.350 --> 12:32.277
But my husband blew through
all of the money.

12:32.721 --> 12:34.988
I mean, turns out I was the success.

12:34.990 --> 12:39.693
He was the stay-at-home bitch
who was designing apps.

12:39.695 --> 12:41.728
So how'd you get here?

12:41.730 --> 12:43.497
I had to do something.

12:43.499 --> 12:45.999
We had a mortgage and a car note,

12:46.001 --> 12:49.836
so I wrote some hot checks.

12:50.405 --> 12:53.106
The second you get out of here,

12:53.108 --> 12:56.109
you take your ass to get some help.

12:56.111 --> 12:57.878
You got problems.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.813
But writing bad checks ain't one of them.

12:59.815 --> 13:02.883
Pbht! I'm fine.

13:02.885 --> 13:05.285
You are not fine.

13:05.287 --> 13:06.811
Do you hear me?

13:08.757 --> 13:10.490
I hear you.

13:10.492 --> 13:12.692
Good.

13:12.694 --> 13:14.928
'Cause I got my own shit to work out.

13:14.930 --> 13:18.765
Ooh! New Des alert! I'm in.

13:18.767 --> 13:21.993
So, what brings you here?

13:23.472 --> 13:25.839
It's a long story.

13:28.143 --> 13:29.676
Shit! Here we go.

13:29.678 --> 13:32.279
Flag on the play. Jenn called.

13:32.281 --> 13:34.714
Feds got Desna on a wire
for money laundering.

13:34.716 --> 13:36.783
Damn! On a wire?

13:36.785 --> 13:38.785
Yeah. Her prison cherry
ain't popped, Uncle.

13:38.787 --> 13:40.220
We got to get her out of there.

13:40.222 --> 13:41.688
What the hell else they got on that wire?

13:41.690 --> 13:43.156
Think the feds are coming for us?

13:43.158 --> 13:44.291
I don't know, boy.

13:44.293 --> 13:46.393
All I do know is we got
to speed this sale up,

13:46.395 --> 13:48.628
and we need to be liquid.

13:48.630 --> 13:49.963
Best sell this shit yesterday.

13:49.965 --> 13:51.298
Call your boy from Pensacola.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.899
Tell him to get over here
with a quickness.

13:52.901 --> 13:54.968
Yeah, I think you're right.

13:54.970 --> 13:56.636
Here he is, come on.

13:56.638 --> 13:58.705
- I'll be back.
- All right.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.273
Toodles.

14:02.144 --> 14:04.277
Someone among us is a traitor.

14:04.279 --> 14:07.180
Can you imagine being all
friendly to Desna's face,

14:07.182 --> 14:10.283
and all the while
collecting info for The Man?

14:10.285 --> 14:12.886
I mean, what sort of person
would do such a thing?

14:12.888 --> 14:15.088
A person under immense pressure.

14:15.090 --> 14:18.224
If I ever find out who did it,
I'm gonna skin him like a cat

14:18.226 --> 14:21.469
and hang him from a tree by his toes.

14:22.230 --> 14:24.831
That's pretty extreme, wouldn't you say?

14:24.833 --> 14:27.267
No. Snitches don't get passes.

14:27.269 --> 14:30.904
How do you know it's not the
Russians or... or Uncle Daddy?

14:30.906 --> 14:32.772
It's probably not even a man.

14:32.774 --> 14:35.566
We're gonna sniff them out,
don't you worry.

14:35.944 --> 14:38.111
Thank you for this.

14:39.915 --> 14:41.815
You're the best.

14:41.817 --> 14:43.116
I'm not gonna be able
to cook for you tonight,

14:43.118 --> 14:45.118
but I left you a little
wrapped-up TV dinner.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.186
Thank you.

15:04.039 --> 15:05.939
It's possible that Boris was acting alone

15:05.941 --> 15:07.849
when he stole my coke.

15:09.111 --> 15:12.846
No one acts without the boss permission.

15:12.848 --> 15:15.782
Hello?

15:15.784 --> 15:17.917
So, you were right about the mole.

15:17.919 --> 15:20.186
- I told you.
- My bad.

15:20.188 --> 15:22.155
A very good decision taking him out.

15:22.157 --> 15:25.759
I had nothing to do with theft. We good?

15:25.761 --> 15:28.228
Yeah. We're good.

15:28.230 --> 15:30.096
Good.

15:32.768 --> 15:34.000
Liar.

15:34.002 --> 15:35.969
You have been blinded by your lust

15:35.971 --> 15:39.136
for that woman for far too long.

15:39.138 --> 15:41.408
She disgusts me.

15:41.410 --> 15:43.676
I never trusted her.

15:44.279 --> 15:46.379
Well, you never trust any woman I'm with.

15:46.381 --> 15:48.448
Zlata wouldn't stab me in the back.

15:48.450 --> 15:50.433
She's Russian!

15:51.486 --> 15:53.820
This is part of her plan.

15:53.822 --> 15:57.557
She wants to run
the entire drug operation

15:57.559 --> 16:01.161
by taking you out.

16:06.168 --> 16:09.235
I'll deal with her. Mm-hmm.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.173
Yeah.

16:15.277 --> 16:17.343
Whoo! I thought my life sucked.

16:17.345 --> 16:20.947
Oh, we're gonna get out of here!

16:20.949 --> 16:22.649
This is just a bump in the road.

16:22.651 --> 16:26.219
Mandy, it feels like all the
wheels done came off this shit.

16:26.221 --> 16:28.888
That's what I said when it was
my first time, too.

16:28.890 --> 16:31.157
Turns out it's no big deal.

16:31.159 --> 16:33.393
I mean, by tomorrow afternoon,
we're gonna be drinking

16:33.395 --> 16:36.029
our lunch and finding you a new Glint.

16:36.031 --> 16:37.797
Mandy, are you crazy?

16:37.799 --> 16:40.633
They're gonna nail me
to the cross for this.

16:40.635 --> 16:44.003
Shit.

16:44.005 --> 16:46.740
I tried so hard

16:46.742 --> 16:49.617
to take care of my family and my crew,

16:51.046 --> 16:54.180
but... I stayed on the ride
too damn long.

16:54.182 --> 16:56.707
Now I don't even know how to get off.

16:57.919 --> 17:00.086
Desna Simms.
You're going to the courthouse.

17:00.088 --> 17:02.222
Your arraignment's in an hour.

17:05.727 --> 17:07.761
Take care of yourself, Mandy.

17:07.762 --> 17:09.702
Go get 'em with that new jeuje!

17:09.727 --> 17:12.464
Go get 'em! Stick it to the man!

17:12.467 --> 17:14.032
Stick it!

17:16.500 --> 17:17.965
I need 10.

17:18.001 --> 17:20.159
I don't care. Just listen, I'm sorry.

17:20.159 --> 17:21.826
Not good enough. I'm in pain.

17:21.828 --> 17:23.493
I can't prescribe to you right now.

17:23.496 --> 17:25.762
Why not?!

17:25.765 --> 17:27.031
You did it last week. Come one.

17:27.032 --> 17:28.599
Hey. What the hell's going on over here?

17:28.601 --> 17:30.568
I'm just not writing scripts
today, that's it.

17:30.570 --> 17:32.803
You think today's the right day
to start switching shit up?

17:32.805 --> 17:34.205
- Yes.
- You gonna tell Crazy Steve that

17:34.207 --> 17:35.606
and everybody else in this room?

17:35.608 --> 17:37.775
- Hey.
- Huh?

17:37.777 --> 17:41.045
Or are you gonna make Kelly
and Brenda feel A-okay?

17:41.047 --> 17:44.515
Well, Doc, pretty nasty kink.

17:44.517 --> 17:45.883
I think we need to talk.

17:45.885 --> 17:47.818
I can't help you. I'm sorry, okay?

17:47.820 --> 17:49.552
Come on. I'm sorry, okay?

17:50.356 --> 17:52.430
Leave me alone.

17:55.094 --> 17:56.827
Doc!

17:56.829 --> 17:58.729
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

17:58.731 --> 18:01.365
Aah!

18:01.367 --> 18:03.334
You better calm your shit down!

18:03.336 --> 18:06.137
Easy for you to say! You have no idea!

18:06.139 --> 18:08.572
Why do you think I'm here.
Des just got popped.

18:08.574 --> 18:10.975
So? Think it's my fault?

18:10.977 --> 18:12.777
W-Why would you think it's my fault?

18:12.779 --> 18:14.078
Nobody said it's your fault.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.147
I'm just saying the feds
got eyes on us, buddy.

18:16.149 --> 18:18.082
So you think I'm gonna talk? All right?

18:18.084 --> 18:19.684
Nothing good ever comes
from talking, huh?

18:19.686 --> 18:22.486
Because believe me, I know.
I know talking.

18:22.488 --> 18:24.922
- Huh?
- It's a... It's a rookie mistake.

18:24.924 --> 18:26.424
I'm having a heart attack.

18:26.426 --> 18:29.060
Is it... Is it possible
I'm having a heart attack?

18:29.062 --> 18:30.394
Hey, calm down, man.

18:30.396 --> 18:32.430
I'm just making sure
the books are clean, okay?

18:32.432 --> 18:35.433
They're always clean. Clean as a whistle.

18:36.536 --> 18:38.369
I can't whistle. I can't even whistle.

18:38.371 --> 18:40.571
You're losing it, man. I'm gonna
get Red on this, all right?

18:40.573 --> 18:42.406
No! Don't.

18:42.408 --> 18:45.443
Please, please. Polly can't know. Please.

18:45.445 --> 18:48.145
Listen, Brickman, whatever's up your ass,

18:48.147 --> 18:50.581
you better get it straight,
you understand me?

18:50.583 --> 18:51.849
- Okay?
- Okay.

18:51.851 --> 18:53.350
Okay.

18:53.352 --> 18:55.319
Please just give me a minute?

18:55.321 --> 18:56.619
I think...

19:09.969 --> 19:12.670
My boys checked. There's no bugs.

19:12.672 --> 19:14.905
So, uh, what are we gonna tell
Zlata about where Desna is?

19:14.907 --> 19:18.042
Uh, we can tell her that,
uh, Dean had a freak out and...

19:18.044 --> 19:19.610
and... and she went to go help him.

19:19.612 --> 19:21.378
No, no. She's not gonna go for that.

19:21.380 --> 19:23.013
She's gonna smell the bullshit.

19:23.015 --> 19:25.015
Look, I can see Jenn's eye
twitching from here.

19:25.017 --> 19:27.351
Is it noticeable? Oh, I'm sorry.

19:27.353 --> 19:29.286
I don't want to go to jail, okay?

19:29.288 --> 19:31.522
Yeah, I know. I am so worried about Dean.

19:31.524 --> 19:33.824
Des really has us
over a barrel this time.

19:33.826 --> 19:35.126
Let me try and call him again.

19:35.128 --> 19:36.627
Listen, we just got to shred this shit

19:36.629 --> 19:38.796
- 'cause cops could be here any minute.
- This is bad.

19:38.798 --> 19:41.632
I'm never gonna get to build
my cabin in Vermont with Arlene.

19:41.634 --> 19:43.288
- Oh.
- Really? "Oh, oh."

19:43.290 --> 19:44.735
How do you think Des
is holding up right now?

19:44.737 --> 19:47.171
She'll be fine. If anybody
can handle it, it's her.

19:47.173 --> 19:49.206
- Dean?
- Hi, Virginia.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.509
Where are you? We're worried about you.

19:51.511 --> 19:54.245
I-I'm fine. I-I'm just tired
of everybody telling me

19:54.247 --> 19:57.014
they have things under control
and they don't.

19:57.016 --> 19:58.949
Yeah, I'm taking control.

19:58.951 --> 20:00.384
Taking control?

20:00.386 --> 20:02.353
Dean, please tell me
what you're about to do.

20:02.355 --> 20:05.256
No. I'm gonna help out Desna.

20:05.258 --> 20:07.558
I'll... I'll call you back.

20:12.965 --> 20:14.488
E-Excuse me.

20:15.501 --> 20:18.602
I... My sister Desna Simms is here,

20:18.604 --> 20:21.704
and... and I would like
to see her immediately.

20:23.242 --> 20:24.909
- She's being arraigned.
- No, no, no.

20:24.911 --> 20:26.310
I-I-I'm her brother, so I would like

20:26.312 --> 20:27.745
to see her right... right now.

20:27.747 --> 20:30.181
Sir, step away from the desk.
You can't act like that.

20:30.183 --> 20:32.349
I-I have the right
to be apprised of her situation,

20:32.351 --> 20:34.752
so I-I would like a status
update, please.

20:34.754 --> 20:36.720
You don't get out of here, I'm
gonna lock your behind up, too.

20:36.722 --> 20:38.722
You can't... You can't do that.
I didn't do anything wrong.

20:38.724 --> 20:40.024
I'm not a criminal.

20:40.026 --> 20:41.492
This is all the money
I made from dancing,

20:41.494 --> 20:44.228
so I'm here to bail her out.
This is the money. I...

20:44.230 --> 20:47.400
Clearly you're not in your right mind.
Take your money and leave.

20:47.402 --> 20:48.966
You can't touch me!
Don't... Don't you touch me!

20:48.968 --> 20:51.168
- You're not allowed to touch me!
- Come back when you've calmed down.

20:51.170 --> 20:52.503
Don't... Don't you touch me!

20:52.505 --> 20:56.006
You're not allowed! You're not allowed!

20:56.008 --> 20:57.374
Yeah.

20:57.376 --> 20:58.776
Baby, I'm just gonna grab
that stuff you want

20:58.778 --> 21:00.044
and I'll be right back.

21:00.046 --> 21:02.313
- He was here.
- Who?

21:02.315 --> 21:04.048
- Hank.
- What?

21:04.050 --> 21:07.284
I had a dream I was giving
a TED Talk and he interrupted,

21:07.286 --> 21:09.653
said he was gonna cornrow Brienne's hair.

21:09.655 --> 21:11.255
The man's crazy.
We need to call the police.

21:11.257 --> 21:13.324
Baby, I think that sounds
like the morphine talking.

21:13.326 --> 21:14.758
You know it'll give you the bad dreams.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.894
No, it wasn't a dream.

21:16.896 --> 21:18.329
You were giving a TED Talk.

21:18.331 --> 21:20.164
No, I swear, he was here.

21:20.166 --> 21:21.532
You know what, honey,
I'm gonna talk to the doctor

21:21.534 --> 21:24.235
about your dosage on account
of your cracky past.

21:24.237 --> 21:26.637
Okay? I love you. I'll see you soon.

21:47.860 --> 21:49.159
What in the Lord?

21:51.364 --> 21:52.461
Oh.

21:53.633 --> 21:55.466
Welcome home, darling.

21:58.070 --> 21:59.937
Playing our song.

22:01.641 --> 22:04.508
Ken, I just got a lot going on.
Can we talk about this later?

22:04.510 --> 22:07.177
I'm just saying sometimes
in life we make choices

22:07.179 --> 22:08.545
in the moment,
and sometimes those choices

22:08.547 --> 22:10.247
aren't the best choices
and we don't know that

22:10.249 --> 22:12.549
till afterwards, and by then,
I-it's too late.

22:12.551 --> 22:14.385
Is this about the brony cosplay?

22:14.387 --> 22:16.620
No, no, that... that wasn't bad.

22:16.622 --> 22:18.756
The lawyer says the
arraignment's in 45 minutes.

22:18.758 --> 22:20.891
Look, I'm referring
to a larger life choice

22:20.893 --> 22:24.395
that in retrospect
may have been made in error,

22:24.397 --> 22:26.530
but so hypothetically speaking, uh,

22:26.532 --> 22:30.234
if I did that, could...
could you forgive me?

22:30.236 --> 22:31.933
Only if I knew what you were
talking about.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.237
Well, you're not listening to me.

22:33.239 --> 22:35.019
I'm trying to tell you something
and you're on your...

22:35.021 --> 22:38.208
FBI! Search warrant! Hands in the air.

22:48.754 --> 22:51.088
- Did we get everything?
- Shut up.

22:51.090 --> 22:52.856
Desna's gonna be fine.

22:56.429 --> 22:59.196
Number 5376, The State vs. Desna Simms.

22:59.198 --> 23:01.432
- Here.
- Good afternoon, Your Honor.

23:01.434 --> 23:03.267
Adrianne Curtis on behalf of The State.

23:03.269 --> 23:05.069
You are informed that an indictment

23:05.071 --> 23:08.339
has been filed in case number 5376.

23:08.341 --> 23:10.240
The charges are as follows.

23:10.242 --> 23:11.575
Count one, money laundering.

23:11.577 --> 23:13.677
- But I didn't do it.
- Count two, racketeering.

23:13.679 --> 23:15.746
- I'm saying that...
- Count three, structuring.

23:15.748 --> 23:16.780
But...

23:16.782 --> 23:18.682
Do you have a lawyer representing you?

23:18.684 --> 23:21.652
Your Honor, there has been
a huge misunderstanding.

23:21.654 --> 23:23.220
Are you representing yourself?

23:23.222 --> 23:25.522
Okay, my lawyer should
be here any minute,

23:25.524 --> 23:27.224
but what I need you to know, sir,

23:27.226 --> 23:30.427
is that I am not a criminal, okay?

23:30.429 --> 23:32.997
I have worked hard to get to where I am.

23:32.999 --> 23:34.698
I run a nail salon in Palmetto.

23:34.700 --> 23:38.535
I have been the sole provider
for my special-needs brother,

23:38.537 --> 23:39.737
and I've been taking care of him

23:39.739 --> 23:41.372
since we were children in the fost...

23:41.374 --> 23:43.607
This isn't the time
and place for testimony.

23:43.609 --> 23:46.477
I'm just trying to let you know,
sir, that I'm a good person...

23:46.479 --> 23:48.812
The prosecution requests
the arraignment be advanced

23:48.814 --> 23:51.582
to Monday to allow the defendant
to appear with her counsel.

23:51.584 --> 23:54.318
Monday?! I got to get home to my brother!

23:54.320 --> 23:56.687
Lauren Zorloni for the defendant.

23:56.689 --> 23:58.622
Arraignment started five minutes ago.

23:58.624 --> 24:01.458
I am so sorry, Your Honor.

24:01.460 --> 24:02.860
How does the client plead?

24:02.862 --> 24:04.194
Not guilty, Your Honor.

24:04.196 --> 24:05.596
We request remand to custody.

24:05.598 --> 24:07.464
- The accused is a flight risk.
- What?!

24:07.466 --> 24:11.335
My client is a responsible
small business owner.

24:11.337 --> 24:13.303
She has no criminal record.

24:13.305 --> 24:15.339
She smells delightful.

24:15.341 --> 24:18.442
She is an upstanding
member of the community.

24:18.444 --> 24:21.812
We request that bail not exceed
$5,000, Your Honor.

24:21.814 --> 24:24.815
She has ties to
the Russian Mafia, Your Honor.

24:24.817 --> 24:26.117
- What?
- That sounds like a destination

24:26.142 --> 24:27.051
getaway to me.

24:27.053 --> 24:29.186
Bail is set at $500,000.

24:29.188 --> 24:30.744
Say what?!

24:31.590 --> 24:33.624
$500,000?

24:33.626 --> 24:35.659
I would have to come up with $50,000.

24:35.661 --> 24:37.027
I don't have that kind of money.

24:37.029 --> 24:39.363
It's taken care of.

24:39.389 --> 24:41.005
Right.

24:42.468 --> 24:45.903
Mmm. That's gonna be good.

24:45.905 --> 24:48.472
You know, I've been dreaming
about this day

24:48.474 --> 24:50.806
since our first two step.

24:51.677 --> 24:54.478
You and I belong together, Jenny Wenny.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.228
Hank, you need to leave.

24:58.851 --> 25:00.651
Have you not seen
what's going on around you?

25:00.653 --> 25:03.387
- Right now.
- Your kids are in danger.

25:03.389 --> 25:06.290
Your husband is an addict.
You need protection.

25:06.292 --> 25:07.491
You need me.

25:07.493 --> 25:09.460
You're out of your goddamn mind.

25:12.331 --> 25:13.831
It's okay.

25:13.833 --> 25:15.365
It's okay.

25:15.367 --> 25:16.767
Hank. It's Ok.

25:16.769 --> 25:18.569
- Let go!
- Shh. It's okay.

25:18.571 --> 25:21.572
It's okay, don't be afraid of me.

25:21.574 --> 25:23.839
I'm here to take you away.

25:24.877 --> 25:28.846
Now, once the girls get home,
we're moving to Israel.

25:28.848 --> 25:29.847
We'll be safe from Bryce

25:29.849 --> 25:32.116
and we can start the healing process.

25:38.691 --> 25:40.090
All right, now, let's pack this shit up.

25:40.092 --> 25:41.440
Come on, y'all.

25:45.297 --> 25:46.997
Zip that up.

25:46.999 --> 25:48.322
Coming.

25:50.035 --> 25:52.369
- Nobody home?
- Come on.

25:52.371 --> 25:54.771
- That him?
- Yeah, that's Kincaid.

25:54.773 --> 25:56.473
What's up?

25:56.475 --> 25:58.509
Thank you for making it on such
short notice, brother.

25:58.511 --> 26:01.845
Holy shit.
Let me get a look at that yayo.

26:01.847 --> 26:03.347
That's a lot of yayo to look at.

26:03.349 --> 26:04.630
Mm.

26:05.151 --> 26:06.884
Slow down there, cousin.

26:06.886 --> 26:08.485
Got to pay to play, baby.

26:08.487 --> 26:10.254
What you cut this with?

26:10.256 --> 26:13.157
- Better not be no baby laxative.
- Shit is pure.

26:13.159 --> 26:15.859
I'll tell you what, the whole thing
...$2 million. That's a steal.

26:15.861 --> 26:18.595
Speaking of a steal,
I'm ganking your shit.

26:18.597 --> 26:20.864
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, you...
- What the...

26:20.866 --> 26:22.166
Hey!

26:23.402 --> 26:25.636
Damn, boy, we've been set up.

26:28.361 --> 26:30.594
Id on now, y'all!

26:30.696 --> 26:32.897
We all... We... We don't want
to kill each other.

26:32.899 --> 26:34.398
Shit, we kin.

26:34.400 --> 26:37.068
I mean, you... you my second
cousin's son, boy.

26:37.070 --> 26:39.470
Ted wouldn't want it
to go down like this.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.806
Oh, he's dead now.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.541
What loyalty do I have to you?

26:43.543 --> 26:46.644
Oh, come on now, Clint,
I loved your daddy.

26:46.646 --> 26:50.347
Yeah. How come you working
for them commies, huh?

26:50.349 --> 26:51.715
They killed him!

26:51.717 --> 26:54.448
I ain't working for no commies.
What's wrong with you?

26:54.450 --> 26:55.966
I wouldn't want them to kill him.

26:55.968 --> 26:58.422
Hell, they took me prisoner in a Subaru!

26:58.424 --> 27:01.759
All right? And then we jacked
this coke from them all.

27:02.086 --> 27:03.752
But y'all didn't reach out.

27:03.754 --> 27:07.256
Shit. I was begging for your help.

27:07.258 --> 27:08.891
They shot my brother.

27:08.893 --> 27:11.994
They got Bryce?

27:11.996 --> 27:14.329
- Got Bryce.
- Damn.

27:17.768 --> 27:19.802
He was all positive and shit.

27:19.804 --> 27:23.539
Yeah, he was... he was positive.

27:23.541 --> 27:27.910
That's why we need y'all
on our side, okay? Look at you.

27:27.912 --> 27:31.346
Look at me, look at all these
men in this room, huh?

27:31.348 --> 27:33.882
We the men that can make
America great again.

27:33.884 --> 27:37.286
Then how y'all reckon
we rectify this then?

27:37.288 --> 27:38.932
Well...

27:43.894 --> 27:46.395
I got me a little proposition for you.

27:46.397 --> 27:47.896
We can settle this together.

27:47.898 --> 27:50.277
Make money and get back at the Russians.

27:54.939 --> 27:56.271
Thank you.

27:56.273 --> 27:59.241
You know, us sisters,
we got to stick together.

27:59.243 --> 28:00.809
- Right.
- Yeah.

28:00.811 --> 28:06.348
Um, how did Polly and the girls
swing $50,000?

28:09.153 --> 28:10.385
Get in.

28:20.531 --> 28:22.297
You get arrested and you don't call me?

28:22.299 --> 28:24.833
Zlata, I was trying
to keep you out of this.

28:24.835 --> 28:27.169
I thought Polly's attorney
was coming to get me.

28:27.171 --> 28:28.855
Get me out of here!

28:28.880 --> 28:30.606
Shut up!

28:30.608 --> 28:33.475
Her attorney taking
little break in my trunk.

28:34.845 --> 28:36.912
Po-po is going to be all over clinic.

28:36.914 --> 28:39.481
We must tell Ken not over-prescribing

28:39.483 --> 28:41.550
until shit dies down.

28:41.552 --> 28:43.819
I happy you kept your mouth shut.

28:43.821 --> 28:45.541
I ain't no snitch.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.836
And I would never betray you, Zlata.

28:49.460 --> 28:52.528
Interesting you bring up betrayal.

28:52.530 --> 28:55.197
Your fiancé is not who you think he is.

28:55.199 --> 28:59.034
My fiancé is a doctor.

28:59.036 --> 29:01.169
Maybe he's a vagina doctor,

29:01.171 --> 29:04.085
- but we partners in drug business.
- What?

29:04.087 --> 29:06.241
I turned his properties into clinics

29:06.243 --> 29:08.143
and I distribute his cocaine.

29:08.145 --> 29:09.811
He gives me cut. Is win-win.

29:09.813 --> 29:11.813
We betray you. Apologize.

29:11.815 --> 29:14.816
So you and Gregory
both been lying to me this...

29:14.818 --> 29:16.919
this whole time?

29:16.921 --> 29:19.555
I know is a lot to process.

29:19.557 --> 29:22.057
Right now, he believes I responsible

29:22.059 --> 29:24.526
for stealing his cocaine from warehouse,

29:24.528 --> 29:26.123
but I know he well.

29:27.082 --> 29:28.797
He will take me on nice little trip

29:28.799 --> 29:32.267
and then he'll shoot me in the face.

29:32.269 --> 29:33.936
I don't believe this shit.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.838
We must align to take him down
and get your charges dropped.

29:36.840 --> 29:40.008
Are you crazy?
How do I know I can trust you?

29:40.010 --> 29:42.044
How do I know you won't betray me again

29:42.046 --> 29:44.479
and it'll be my black ass
in the back of this trunk?

29:44.481 --> 29:46.014
Who bailed you out of jail right now?

29:46.016 --> 29:48.450
We want same thing... to take him down.

29:48.452 --> 29:50.522
I the only way you can do this.

29:57.695 --> 29:58.994
- You know what?
- What?

29:58.996 --> 30:01.930
Brienne and Baylor get really hangry,

30:01.932 --> 30:03.899
and they don't love matzo,
and so I was thinking

30:03.901 --> 30:07.080
maybe we could order a pizza
before the long flight.

30:07.738 --> 30:10.105
- A Palmetto last supper.
- Exactly.

30:10.107 --> 30:11.373
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:11.375 --> 30:12.674
So, I'm just gonna get my cellphone.

30:12.676 --> 30:14.176
I have the number programmed
right in there.

30:14.178 --> 30:16.478
- Use the landline.
- Okay.

30:23.921 --> 30:25.921
- 911.
- Hey there, I am at 23...

30:25.923 --> 30:27.055
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

30:27.057 --> 30:30.525
You know, actually, I prefer Steve's.

30:30.527 --> 30:32.902
- It's New York style.
- Okay.

30:32.904 --> 30:35.464
Steve's Pizza, takeout or delivery?

30:37.301 --> 30:39.868
Hey, Jenn, when you coming back?

30:39.870 --> 30:42.337
Hey, uh, I'd like to order a large pizza.

30:42.339 --> 30:43.472
What you talking about?

30:43.474 --> 30:45.240
A large vegetable pizza.

30:45.242 --> 30:47.442
It has to be kosher
because my friend here

30:47.444 --> 30:48.956
only eats kosher.

30:49.747 --> 30:51.647
Wait. Is Hank there?

30:51.649 --> 30:54.316
Mm-hmm, yes. It's 233 Theater Street.

30:54.318 --> 30:55.417
Are you in trouble?

30:55.419 --> 30:56.918
Absolutely.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.388
So, if you could just send
someone as soon as possible,

30:59.390 --> 31:02.524
that would be so great because
we have a flight to catch.

31:02.526 --> 31:05.138
Okay, thank you. Bye.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.566
Yay.

31:15.239 --> 31:17.539
Okay.

31:23.113 --> 31:24.980
Anybody here?

31:24.982 --> 31:27.816
She's here! Desna! Oh, thank God.

31:27.818 --> 31:29.985
- Are you okay?
- Polly-Pol.

31:29.987 --> 31:31.486
- Did they hurt you?
- I'm fine.

31:31.488 --> 31:32.854
Okay, good. Thank God, girl.

31:32.856 --> 31:35.023
I did not want to have
to find another big sister.

31:35.025 --> 31:36.792
- Yes.
- Feds raided.

31:36.794 --> 31:39.147
- They didn't get jack.
- That's right.

31:39.997 --> 31:42.631
I'm glad you're still here, Ann.

31:42.633 --> 31:45.600
Listen, I'm working with Zlata.

31:45.602 --> 31:47.502
Her lawyer was the one that got me out.

31:47.504 --> 31:49.404
Wait, what about my lawyer?

31:49.406 --> 31:50.739
He's in Zlata's trunk.

31:50.741 --> 31:52.774
- What?! Oh, my God!
- Oh, no, no. Pol.

31:52.776 --> 31:56.311
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Pol, Pol, he's alive, okay?

31:56.313 --> 31:57.312
Oh, God.

31:57.314 --> 31:59.715
Zlata wants me to help her.

31:59.717 --> 32:02.017
She thinks Ruval turned on her.

32:02.019 --> 32:05.287
We did it, y'all. We started a war.

32:05.289 --> 32:07.034
I can't believe this shit.

32:07.691 --> 32:09.191
You're not even out five minutes

32:09.193 --> 32:11.193
and already you're back
in bed with this bitch?

32:11.195 --> 32:12.494
This... This is making me nervous.

32:12.496 --> 32:14.029
Okay, no, no, no, listen.

32:14.031 --> 32:16.665
I'ma play her this time, right?

32:16.667 --> 32:18.233
She's gonna think we're besties,

32:18.235 --> 32:20.736
and then I'm gonna flip
the script on that ass.

32:20.738 --> 32:22.637
What? Where you going?

32:22.639 --> 32:24.773
I'm done with this.

32:24.775 --> 32:26.475
I'm going home to Arlene.

32:26.477 --> 32:29.044
Arlene is the one that arrested me.

32:33.350 --> 32:35.016
You're lying.

32:37.621 --> 32:38.982
You're lying.

32:39.556 --> 32:41.735
Arlene's a security guard.

32:42.192 --> 32:44.092
I pick her up at work.

32:44.094 --> 32:45.494
She wears a uniform.

32:45.496 --> 32:47.195
She played you, Ann.

32:47.197 --> 32:48.909
That's bullshit!

32:49.767 --> 32:52.167
I know my lady, you liar.

32:52.169 --> 32:55.937
Your lady is working for the feds.

32:55.939 --> 32:59.207
They got a mini series on us
the size of "Roots."

32:59.209 --> 33:01.076
No, no, no, no, no, no.

33:01.078 --> 33:02.377
Wake up, Ann.

33:02.379 --> 33:04.179
She played you to get to us.

33:04.181 --> 33:06.548
No, why would she do that to me?

33:06.550 --> 33:07.916
Because this thing is bigger

33:07.918 --> 33:10.185
than just the money laundering, okay?

33:10.187 --> 33:14.226
It's the illegal escorts,
it's the over-prescribing.

33:15.058 --> 33:16.436
Murder.

33:19.396 --> 33:20.829
Why would she do that to me?

33:20.831 --> 33:22.984
- I'm sorry.
- No.

33:26.303 --> 33:29.199
I am so, so sorry.

34:36.184 --> 34:37.751
I thought you weren't gonna see your mom.

34:37.753 --> 34:39.018
She just showed up.

34:39.021 --> 34:41.987
I have so much to thank you for,

34:41.989 --> 34:43.822
taking care of my little Marnie.

34:43.824 --> 34:46.659
Well, since you decided to
sell her to pervy Elvis,

34:46.661 --> 34:48.594
I figured it was the least I could do.

34:48.597 --> 34:50.853
My mom was just telling me
how she's gotten clean.

34:50.856 --> 34:51.931
Uh-huh.

34:51.933 --> 34:53.466
She wants me back.

34:53.467 --> 34:56.402
It was time for me
to face up to what I've done.

34:56.405 --> 34:57.837
I mean, people have been
telling me to clean up

34:57.839 --> 34:59.539
my act and change my life for years.

34:59.541 --> 35:02.876
Oh, so you think a few months
clean suddenly makes you a mom?

35:02.878 --> 35:04.210
Let me tell you something.

35:04.212 --> 35:05.812
I'm the one who's been dealing

35:05.814 --> 35:08.748
with her heartache and her attitude.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.550
That's what being a mom is.

35:10.552 --> 35:12.010
I hear you.

35:13.021 --> 35:15.288
I now know that when people are trying

35:15.290 --> 35:18.934
to tell you something, you have
to be willing to listen.

35:22.564 --> 35:23.897
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

35:23.899 --> 35:26.191
No, no, no. You need to stay put.

35:26.902 --> 35:28.803
Marnie's mom was just leaving.

35:36.211 --> 35:39.045
I never stopped loving you, Marnie.

35:47.522 --> 35:49.289
Come here, baby.

35:50.225 --> 35:53.860
I just want you to know
I love you, so much.

35:55.630 --> 35:58.801
Can you just go into your room
for just a little bit?

35:58.803 --> 36:00.100
Yeah.

36:03.199 --> 36:04.665
We need to talk.

36:07.109 --> 36:10.910
Whoo! Oh, you are on fire up there, man.

36:10.912 --> 36:13.012
What'd you take? Sharing is caring.

36:13.014 --> 36:14.747
I-I don't take any narcotics.

36:14.749 --> 36:16.549
I was running on pure anger tonight.

36:16.551 --> 36:18.651
Oh, those cherry pops
did look a little ragey.

36:18.653 --> 36:20.687
Oddly enough, I-I made over $200 more

36:20.689 --> 36:22.255
than I normally make in tips.

36:22.257 --> 36:25.492
Kudos to you, man.
But you know what they say.

36:25.494 --> 36:27.727
Leave the rage on stage.

36:34.832 --> 36:36.820
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:37.873 --> 36:40.740
I-I'm sorry I-I-I didn't call you back.

36:40.742 --> 36:42.684
It's okay. I knew you'd be here.

36:43.125 --> 36:45.125
They let Des out.

36:45.150 --> 36:46.946
I-I don't want to talk about
that right now, Virginia.

36:46.948 --> 36:48.314
But what happened, Dean?

36:48.316 --> 36:50.583
- Are you okay? What's wrong?
- No, I'm not okay.

36:50.585 --> 36:53.286
They... They didn't even let me see
her, and they invaded my space.

36:53.288 --> 36:55.455
It was all because of Desna's
stupid life choices.

36:55.457 --> 36:58.491
She doesn't mean to hurt you.
You know that.

36:58.493 --> 37:00.360
Yeah, but it doesn't even
matter, Virginia, because...

37:00.362 --> 37:01.861
because I get hurt anyway, and then look

37:01.863 --> 37:03.363
what she's doing to herself. It's...

37:03.365 --> 37:05.532
Okay, but do you ever talk
to her about it?

37:05.534 --> 37:06.833
Does she know how you feel?

37:06.835 --> 37:08.768
Virginia, I-I-I talk to her all the time.

37:08.770 --> 37:10.637
She doesn't listen to me.

37:10.639 --> 37:11.971
She treats me like a child.

37:11.973 --> 37:14.040
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

37:14.591 --> 37:16.843
Dean, look at me.

37:16.845 --> 37:18.745
You are not a child.

37:18.747 --> 37:20.713
You are a grown-ass man.

37:20.715 --> 37:22.649
Yeah, I'm a grown-ass man.

37:22.651 --> 37:25.985
You got a job, you take care of me,

37:25.987 --> 37:27.854
and we love each other.

37:27.856 --> 37:29.622
- Yeah.
- Right?

37:29.624 --> 37:32.325
- Yeah.
- That's all that matters.

37:32.327 --> 37:35.428
- Yeah.
- Just me and you, okay?

37:35.430 --> 37:37.155
Me and you.

37:39.501 --> 37:41.367
- Okay.
- Yeah.

37:47.909 --> 37:50.168
You were right about everything.

37:50.845 --> 37:52.504
I should've listened to you.

37:53.154 --> 37:54.888
I love you, Des.

38:00.956 --> 38:02.822
Be strong.

38:02.824 --> 38:05.391
I want to kill her.

38:05.393 --> 38:08.395
We really would be deeper in.

38:10.645 --> 38:12.774
Just go tell her how you feel.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.948
All right.

38:31.173 --> 38:32.939
You stupid piece of shit.

38:33.221 --> 38:35.521
A wire? You were wearing a wire?

38:35.523 --> 38:37.223
You put Desna in jail!

38:37.225 --> 38:39.659
They had me for over-prescribing
and you for the escorts.

38:39.661 --> 38:42.362
They wanted a bigger fish.
I thought it was gonna be Zlata.

38:42.364 --> 38:44.797
Well, then why didn't you
send me a message?

38:44.799 --> 38:48.034
Sign language, smoke signal?

38:48.036 --> 38:51.237
You don't know the first thing
about loyalty.

38:51.239 --> 38:55.942
I was in the slammer
with murderers, terrorists,

38:55.944 --> 38:58.878
pedophiles, and you know what's worse?

38:58.880 --> 39:00.090
Terrorist pedophile?

39:00.092 --> 39:01.948
A snitch.

39:02.407 --> 39:03.850
Polly. I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

39:03.852 --> 39:05.852
You stupid!

39:05.854 --> 39:07.537
Sorry. We're done.

39:09.691 --> 39:11.357
We're done.

39:11.359 --> 39:13.493
Get your Shabbat candles and get out.

39:18.566 --> 39:22.051
But you, you are so full of shit!

39:23.091 --> 39:25.291
You used me!

39:28.389 --> 39:29.454
It's complicated.

39:29.456 --> 39:32.424
"It's complicated"? That's what you got?

39:32.426 --> 39:34.121
It's complicated?

39:34.122 --> 39:37.561
This is what I had to
do to get my job back.

39:37.595 --> 39:39.214
A job I lost because of you.

39:39.216 --> 39:41.014
So this is about money?
That's what it is?

39:41.016 --> 39:42.301
It's about the law,

39:42.303 --> 39:45.366
something you and your friends
have no regard for.

39:46.493 --> 39:48.907
Was any of it ever real?

39:49.329 --> 39:50.809
Doesn't matter.

39:51.539 --> 39:54.813
If you thought I was gonna
fall down and apologize to you,

39:55.251 --> 39:56.753
you're wrong.

39:57.879 --> 40:00.352
I can't be with anybody who lies to me.

40:02.856 --> 40:05.057
It's goodbye, then.

40:21.575 --> 40:24.443
Whoo!

40:24.445 --> 40:27.813
You know, the pizza won't be
here for another half-hour.

40:28.326 --> 40:32.638
What should we do till then, sweetheart?

40:32.640 --> 40:35.018
We should probably read
the Torah, don't you think?

40:35.020 --> 40:37.629
Or the New Testament.
Or we could alternate.

40:37.654 --> 40:40.154
That's probably the best,
but whatever you prefer.

40:40.156 --> 40:42.799
I love the enthusiasm.

40:43.493 --> 40:45.259
How about we take this up to the bedroom?

40:45.261 --> 40:47.028
It's been a while since
I've had a nice cry.

40:47.030 --> 40:48.429
- That sounds so good, babe...
- I just... I need it.

40:48.431 --> 40:49.764
...and I want you real bad but, you know,

40:49.766 --> 40:51.332
the girls have already been through years

40:51.334 --> 40:54.335
of therapy 'cause
the trauma I've caused them,

40:54.337 --> 40:57.672
and I don't want to cause
any more trauma.

40:57.674 --> 40:58.873
So, I...

40:58.875 --> 41:00.074
You think I'm stupid, don't you?

41:00.076 --> 41:02.043
I don't. Listen, I love you.

41:02.045 --> 41:03.111
I... No.

41:03.113 --> 41:04.479
I do. I want you to be...

41:04.481 --> 41:06.581
You're just trying to play me.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.349
You don't love me.

41:08.351 --> 41:10.184
That's not true. I do love you.

41:10.186 --> 41:12.453
I want you to be my husband.

41:12.455 --> 41:13.955
And I want to...

41:15.225 --> 41:17.291
You leave her alone, you asshole!

41:17.293 --> 41:18.593
Call the cops! You're under arrest!

41:18.595 --> 41:20.328
Bryce! Aah!

41:20.330 --> 41:23.031
- Aah!
- Get him, baby!

41:23.033 --> 41:24.532
Get him!

41:26.970 --> 41:30.088
I got him!

41:30.090 --> 41:31.239
Aah!

41:31.241 --> 41:32.306
Baby!

41:32.308 --> 41:33.639
Get off of him, you maniac!

41:33.641 --> 41:35.309
Palmetto Police!

41:35.311 --> 41:38.212
It's him! He's getting away!

41:39.449 --> 41:40.948
- Yeah.
- I saved you.

41:40.950 --> 41:42.350
- You saved me.
- I saved you.

41:42.352 --> 41:44.043
- You saved me.
- I saved you.

41:44.187 --> 41:47.046
- You saved me.
- I saved you.

41:59.013 --> 42:02.047
Dean, are you okay?

42:02.049 --> 42:03.516
Yeah, I-I'm okay.

42:03.518 --> 42:06.185
Baby, I was... I was worried about you.

42:06.187 --> 42:07.987
What's this?

42:07.989 --> 42:09.677
Dean, what's all this?

42:10.858 --> 42:12.892
I-I-I... I've been... I've been
doing a lot of thinking, Des,

42:12.894 --> 42:14.860
about... about you and me and...

42:14.862 --> 42:17.496
and this situation, and, yeah,

42:17.498 --> 42:19.665
I decided me and Virginia are moving out.

42:19.667 --> 42:22.067
Wait a minute, what...

42:22.069 --> 42:24.036
Yeah, I can't... I can't...
I can't stay here with you.

42:24.038 --> 42:25.491
- Okay, Dean...
- No, 'cause between...

42:25.516 --> 42:26.777
between you getting

42:26.779 --> 42:28.574
arrested and then...
and then all the other illegal

42:28.576 --> 42:30.990
things you keep doing, and then you...

42:32.313 --> 42:33.952
I got to go.

42:36.817 --> 42:38.247
If, um...

42:39.420 --> 42:41.250
If that's...

42:42.657 --> 42:44.409
If that's what you really want.

42:44.411 --> 42:47.205
Yeah. That's... That's what I want.

42:47.985 --> 42:49.852
I-I-I'm really disappointed, Des.

42:49.854 --> 42:52.588
You keep... You keep saying
things are gonna change

42:52.590 --> 42:54.323
and then they never change.

42:54.325 --> 42:55.557
Never.

43:09.807 --> 43:11.707
It's gonna be okay.

43:18.349 --> 43:20.649
At least I have you.

43:34.432 --> 43:37.299
Mm. Mnh-mnh.

44:09.433 --> 44:11.233
We need to talk.

44:11.235 --> 44:13.135
Come in, sister friend.

44:14.772 --> 44:17.640
Zlata, I have been thinking long and hard

44:17.642 --> 44:20.391
about what my options are.

44:22.213 --> 44:24.113
You hurt me.

44:24.115 --> 44:26.949
You betrayed me.
You pretended to be my friend.

44:26.951 --> 44:28.317
You pretended to care about me,

44:28.319 --> 44:31.687
and then you went
behind my back with Gregory.

44:31.689 --> 44:33.789
Again, I sorry.

44:33.791 --> 44:35.424
I made a huge mistake.

44:35.426 --> 44:37.426
You must forgive me.

44:37.428 --> 44:41.037
Well, in spite of all your bullshit,

44:41.933 --> 44:44.123
we do make a good team.

44:45.262 --> 44:47.095
Great decision.

44:47.371 --> 44:49.371
We keep you out of prison.

44:49.373 --> 44:51.707
We die or ride.

44:51.709 --> 44:55.144
Close enough. So, original plan.

44:55.146 --> 44:59.515
I marry him, y'all kill me,
and then take over my license.

44:59.517 --> 45:00.916
New plan.

45:00.918 --> 45:03.819
I marry him, you kill him,

45:03.821 --> 45:06.188
then I sign his assets over to you,

45:06.190 --> 45:08.290
except the license for the clinic.

45:08.292 --> 45:11.484
You know I can't do that.
And then I'm done.

45:13.264 --> 45:17.499
I want you to open five more clinics.

45:17.501 --> 45:19.200
I'll open three.

45:20.604 --> 45:22.912
I knew I could count on you.
