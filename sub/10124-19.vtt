IT'S THE TRUTH.

02:50.133 --> 02:51.500

02:51.500 --> 02:53.200
THE GUY'S 63 YEARS OLD.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.133
HE WEARS A TRIBBLE
ON HIS HEAD.

02:55.133 --> 02:58.000
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
FAMOUS, JUST REAL.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
ANYBODY YOU LIKE.

03:00.233 --> 03:02.367
ANYBODY?
ANYBODY.

03:02.367 --> 03:03.400
ABSOLUTELY ANYBODY?

03:03.400 --> 03:04.800
ABSOLUTELY ANYBODY.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.400
I PICK SHAWN.
I PICK CORY.

RIGHT INTO THAT.

03:09.734 --> 03:11.667

WHY'D SHE DUMP SHAWN?

04:07.967 --> 04:10.200
I THINK
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.867
LIKE HER PARENTS
WOULD EVER LET HER
GO OUT WITH HIM.

04:13.867 --> 04:15.500

I'M WRITING ABOUT SHAWN.

09:20.467 --> 09:21.600
OF COURSE.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.300
OF THE TRULY
GREAT LIVES LIVED,

09:24.300 --> 09:25.667
I SUPPOSE SHAWN HUNTER

09:25.667 --> 09:27.867
WOULD BE
THE OBVIOUS CHOICE,

09:27.867 --> 09:31.867
FALLING SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN GANDHI
AND SOUPY SALES.

09:31.867 --> 09:33.567
I WAS JUST WONDERING,

09:33.567 --> 09:35.400
DO PEOPLE TURN OUT
A CERTAIN WAY

09:35.400 --> 09:37.467
BECAUSE OF WHERE
THEY COME FROM,

09:37.467 --> 09:39.500
WHERE THEY LIVE,
WHO THEIR PARENTS ARE?

09:39.500 --> 09:42.767
THE OLD NATURE
VERSUS NURTURE
CONUNDRUM.

09:42.767 --> 09:46.300
YEAH, TO USE
A LOT OF WORDS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.934
I BELIEVE THAT A MAN,

09:48.934 --> 09:50.800
NO MATTER WHERE
HE COMES FROM,

09:50.800 --> 09:52.000
CHOOSES HIS OWN PATH.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.467
SO NO MATTER
WHO YOU ARE,

09:54.467 --> 09:56.834
YOU CAN CHOOSE
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.300
ABSOLUTELY.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.834
[MOTHER]
CORY, DINNER!

09:59.834 --> 10:02.233
I'LL COME IN
WHEN I CHOOSE TO.

10:02.233 --> 10:03.900
GET YOUR BUTT
IN HERE NOW.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.367
UH, MR. FEENY?

10:08.367 --> 10:10.033
MY THEORY BITES?

10:10.033 --> 10:11.300
I'M THINKING.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.800
WHAT'S THIS?

10:16.800 --> 10:19.467
A SUBLIMINAL
LEARN TO SKATE
IN YOUR SLEEP TAPE.

10:19.467 --> 10:23.200
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO SKATE IN MY SLEEP.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.500
OH, YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU GOT THAT SMILE.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.867
THANK YOU.

10:28.867 --> 10:31.767
I DUBBED OVER MY MOM'S
WEIGHT-LOSS TAPE,

10:31.767 --> 10:33.467
BUT IT SHOULD
STILL WORK.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.900
IT WORKED FOR HER.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.100
NO, IT DIDN'T.
SHE'S HUGE.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.734
YEAH, AND IN
ONLY EIGHT WEEKS.

10:38.734 --> 10:41.900
THIS IS A STUPID IDEA.
IT'LL NEVER WORK.

10:41.900 --> 10:45.000
I'M JUST GOING
TO TELL HER
I CAN'T SKATE.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.100
THE SKATING SKIRTS
KEEP GETTING SHORTER
AND SHORTER.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.467
PRETTY SOON, I WON'T
BE WEARING ANYTHING.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.033
OH, ERIC.

10:53.033 --> 10:56.667
SEE YOU FRIDAY
ON THE ICE.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.233
I PLAY IT
WHILE I SLEEP?

11:02.367 --> 11:04.400
NO, NO, NO.
MORE DETACHED.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.934
YOU STILL LOOK FRIENDLY.

11:05.934 --> 11:08.100
UH, SLOUCH A LITTLE BIT.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.100
A LITTLE BIT!

11:10.100 --> 11:11.600
AND MORE LIP.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.100
FRANKIE, YOU DO IT.
I CAN'T WORK WITH THIS KID.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.300
IT'S MY FIRST DAY.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.033
JOEY, YOU REMEMBER
YOUR FIRST DAY.

11:19.033 --> 11:20.300
YOU WORE A SUIT.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.667
GUYS, ONCE I
GET THE LOOK DOWN,

11:24.667 --> 11:25.767
THEN WHAT?

11:25.767 --> 11:28.200
LISTEN TO THE EAGER BEAVER.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.367
O.K., EAGER. THIS MORNING,
YOU GET THE BAGELS.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.767
BAGELS?
BAGELS.

11:35.767 --> 11:38.600
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S IT.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.367
SHAWN, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

11:42.367 --> 11:43.367
WHERE YOU BEEN?

11:43.367 --> 11:44.700
NOWHERE, MAN.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.000
COME ON, SHAWN.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.834
IT'S TIME WE BOTH
FACE THE FACTS.

11:48.834 --> 11:49.900
WHAT FACTS?

11:49.900 --> 11:51.834
YOU AND I
ARE DIFFERENT.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.800
WE'LL END UP
IN DIFFERENT PLACES.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.100
SAYS WHO?

11:55.100 --> 11:58.667
LET'S DO US A FAVOR NOW
AND CALL IT QUITS.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.367
WHAT HAS
GOTTEN INTO YOU?

12:00.367 --> 12:02.000
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.100
GET WHAT?
LOOK AT YOUR HOUSE.

12:04.100 --> 12:07.100
LOOK WHERE I LIVE.
LOOK AT OUR PARENTS.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.000
I KNOW WHERE I'M HEADED.
JUST LET ME GET THERE.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.033
SHAWN!

12:11.033 --> 12:12.467
JUST LET ME
GET THERE NOW!

12:17.367 --> 12:20.600
HEY, KINER,
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.200
SORRY. FRESH OUT.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.400
FIND ONE.

12:25.033 --> 12:26.300
OH. THERE'S ONE NOW.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.600
HA HA.

12:27.600 --> 12:31.100
I NOTICED SHAWN HUNTER'S
BEEN HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.600
SORRY, MR. TURNER.
WE'RE FULL UP.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.200
BUT WE'LL PUT YOU
ON THE WAITING LIST.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.500
CUT THE KID A BREAK.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.400
I'M LETTING HIM
HANG OUT WITH ME.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.667
YEAH. WHAT A GUY
YOU ARE.

12:42.667 --> 12:46.400
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT THE KID
NEEDS RIGHT NOW.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.600
AM I GETTING A SPEECH?

12:48.600 --> 12:50.200
YOU'LL GET MORE
THAN THAT

12:50.200 --> 12:51.734
IF HUNTER'S
NOT BACK IN MY CLASS.

12:55.867 --> 12:58.867
YOU STOOD THERE
AND TOOK THAT
FROM A TEACHER?

12:58.867 --> 13:01.100
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
SAY NOTHING?

13:01.100 --> 13:03.967
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER
THAN WORDS, GENTLEMEN.

13:03.967 --> 13:08.600
I JUST CAME UP WITH
THE PERFECT INITIATION
FOR HUNTER.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.100
[WOMAN]
<i>THERE ARE NO BARRIERS </i>
<i>TO YOUR SUCCESS </i>

13:11.100 --> 13:12.900
<i>WHEN YOU ARE IN CONTROL. </i>

13:12.900 --> 13:14.200
<i>YOU CAN-- </i>
[JASON] <i>ICE SKATE. </i>

13:14.200 --> 13:15.567
[WOMAN]
<i>THAT'S RIGHT. </i>

13:15.567 --> 13:17.867
<i>YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY, </i>
<i>POSITIVELY... </i>

13:17.867 --> 13:18.867
[JASON]
<i>ICE SKATE. </i>

13:18.867 --> 13:21.033
[WOMAN]
<i>FOOD HAS NO POWER OVER YOU. </i>

13:21.033 --> 13:23.000
<i>SURE YOU'VE TRIED OTHER DIETS, </i>

13:23.000 --> 13:24.367
<i>NOW YOU FINALLY-- </i>

13:24.367 --> 13:25.500
<i>SKATE REAL GOOD. </i>

13:25.500 --> 13:27.600
<i>PICTURE A BEAUTIFUL, </i>
<i>THIN-- </i>

13:27.600 --> 13:28.600
<i>ICE SKATER. </i>

13:28.600 --> 13:30.000
<i>...REACHING OUT TO YOU, </i>

13:30.000 --> 13:31.300
<i>ENCOURAGING YOU, </i>

13:31.300 --> 13:32.834
<i>SHOWING YOU HOW TO-- </i>

13:32.834 --> 13:33.767
<i>ICE SKATE. </i>

13:35.567 --> 13:38.367
WHAT THE HECK'S
GOING ON?

13:38.367 --> 13:40.200
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE...

13:40.200 --> 13:41.600
I'M YOUR INNER SKATER.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.133
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.

13:43.133 --> 13:44.200
BUT HOW?

13:44.200 --> 13:45.734
YOU LIKE VALERIE?

13:45.734 --> 13:47.233
WELL, YEAH.

13:47.233 --> 13:49.467
I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO SKATE
RIGHT INTO HER HEART.

13:49.467 --> 13:51.367
THE LAST TIME
I SKATED,

13:51.367 --> 13:54.400
I FELL ON MY FACE
AND SPLIT MY LIPS.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.100
I COULDN'T EVEN EAT
THE CAKE.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.500
DON'T PUT UP BARRIERS
TO YOUR SUCCESS.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.133
IF YOU BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF,

13:59.133 --> 14:00.467
YOU CAN ICE SKATE.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.600
BUT...
HUSH. TAKE MY HAND.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.767
O.K.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.700
WHERE IS THIS PLACE?

14:10.700 --> 14:12.767
YOUR INNER RINK.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.300
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SKATE.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.900
DO WHAT I DID.

14:28.900 --> 14:29.834
O.K.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.300
HEY, NANCY,
WATCH THIS.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.400
TRIPLE LUTZ,
DOUBLE-AXEL.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.233
I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE '98 GAMES.

15:06.233 --> 15:07.500
IN YOUR DREAMS.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.200
I DON'T WANT THIS
TO END.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.734
IT MUST. IT'S
THE END OF SIDE ONE.

15:11.734 --> 15:13.233
PLEASE
TURN THE TAPE OVER.

15:13.233 --> 15:15.000
HUH?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.934
<i>PLEASE TURN OVER THE TAPE. </i>

15:16.934 --> 15:18.567
<i>THIS IS END OF SIDE ONE. </i>

15:22.400 --> 15:25.033
I CAN SKATE.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.100
I CAN SKATE NOW.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.567
AND FOOD HAS
NO POWER OVER ME.

15:37.467 --> 15:40.200
CORY, MAYBE IT'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

15:40.200 --> 15:42.200
BUT YOU'RE PUTTING
ORANGE JUICE
ON YOUR CEREAL.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.600
HUH?

15:44.600 --> 15:46.800
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:46.800 --> 15:48.734
NOTHING.

15:48.734 --> 15:52.400
IT'S JUST THAT SHAWN
DOESN'T WANT TO BE
MY FRIEND ANYMORE.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.967
SINCE WHEN?

15:53.967 --> 15:55.500
SINCE YESTERDAY.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.734
YOU GUYS HAVE A FIGHT?

15:57.734 --> 16:00.500
NO. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY
MAKE SOME SENSE.

16:00.500 --> 16:04.000
SHAWN THINKS WE'LL GROW UP
AND NOT BE FRIENDS,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
SO HE JUST WANT TO
STOP BEING FRIENDS NOW.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.100
WHY DOES HE THINK THAT?

16:09.100 --> 16:12.200
IT'S STUPID STUFF
LIKE WHERE HE LIVES,

16:12.200 --> 16:13.600
WHAT SNOBBY GIRLS THINK.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.500
NOW HE'S MAD AT ME
FOR NO REASON.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.967
MY GUESS IS
HE'S REALLY NOT
MAD AT YOU.

16:19.967 --> 16:21.834
THEN WHY IS HE
ACTING LIKE THIS?

16:21.834 --> 16:24.400
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
CAN PUSH YOU AWAY

16:24.400 --> 16:26.500
WHEN THEY NEED YOU
THE MOST.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.767
THEN HE MUST
REALLY NEED ME.

16:28.767 --> 16:30.734
MAYBE HE DOES.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.400
TURNER'S BIKE.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.233
CLEARLY, HE TAKES
VERY GOOD CARE OF IT.

16:38.233 --> 16:40.233
NOT A SCRATCH ON IT.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.667
LOOK HOW IT SHINES.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.767
YOU COULD EAT IT.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.233
YOU MEAN EAT OFF IT.

16:44.233 --> 16:46.367
I SAID WHAT I SAID.

16:46.367 --> 16:48.400
IT'S A THING OF BEAUTY.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.867
SHAME WHAT'S ABOUT
TO HAPPEN TO IT.

16:51.867 --> 16:53.500
WHAT'S ABOUT
TO HAPPEN TO IT?

16:53.500 --> 16:55.467
YOU ARE, MY FRIEND.

16:55.467 --> 16:57.934
HEY, MY ADVICE
ON THE FIRST SWING,

16:57.934 --> 17:01.100
DON'T GO FOR A HOME RUN.
JUST MAKE CONTACT.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.667
I RECOMMEND
THE HEADLIGHT.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.233
GOOD NOISE,
BROKEN GLASS,

17:04.233 --> 17:05.734
A REAL
CROWD-PLEASER.

17:08.100 --> 17:10.667
SWING, BATTER,
SWING, BATTER,
SWING, BATTER,

17:10.667 --> 17:12.400
SWING, BATTER,
SWING, BATTER.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.000
CAN I TAKE A COUPLE
PRACTICE SWINGS FIRST?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.867
KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING?

17:17.867 --> 17:19.100
WHAT, FRANKIE?

17:19.100 --> 17:20.734
HE AIN'T GOT THE GUTS.

17:20.734 --> 17:22.200
YEAH, I'M SMELLING
CHICKEN.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.667
A BIG ONE.
EXTRA CRISPY.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.800
LET'S TAKE HIM
TO THE COLONEL.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.100
HE'LL PLUCK YOU,
FRY YOU,

17:27.100 --> 17:29.100
AND SERVE YOU
WITH BISCUITS.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.400
I JUST REMEMBERED
SOMETHING.

17:32.900 --> 17:36.300
O.K., HUNTER,
THIS IS WHERE WE FIND OUT

17:36.300 --> 17:38.100
IF YOU'RE REALLY WITH US.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.500
GO AHEAD.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.767
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S UP?

17:43.767 --> 17:45.300
CORY, GET OUT OF HERE.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.967
SHAWN, THAT
LOOKS LIKE A BAT.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.033
COULD THAT BE
TURNER'S BIKE?

17:50.033 --> 17:53.000
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
NOW WOULD YOU LEAVE?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
NO. THIS LOOKS LIKE FUN.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.133
HERE. LET ME GO FIRST.

17:57.133 --> 17:58.367
CORY, LET GO.

17:58.367 --> 18:00.967
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

18:00.967 --> 18:01.834
NEITHER ARE YOU.

18:01.834 --> 18:03.000
JUST LET ME DO THIS.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.867
IF YOU'RE DOING IT,
I'M DOING IT.

18:04.867 --> 18:06.300
THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.367
I DON'T BELONG HERE?

18:07.367 --> 18:08.700
YEAH.

18:08.700 --> 18:11.100
IF YOU BELONG HERE,
THEN I BELONG HERE.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.467
HEY, WE GOT
SOME BUSINESS HERE.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.800
JUST WALK AWAY WHILE YOUR
LEGS STILL BEND ONLY ONCE.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.200
THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND SHAWN,

18:19.200 --> 18:22.500
SO TAKE YOUR GREASY HEAD
AND YOUR RAT-FACED THUG

18:22.500 --> 18:25.033
AND GET AWAY
FROM MY FRIEND.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.967
OH, MY.

18:29.967 --> 18:32.367
OH, MY, MY, MY.

18:32.367 --> 18:33.500
ALL RIGHT, HARLEY,

18:33.500 --> 18:36.100
YOU GOT ONE PUNCH,
SO MAKE IT GOOD.

18:36.100 --> 18:39.500
CHANCES ARE IT'S
GOING TO KILL ME.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.767
HEY, FELLAS.

18:40.767 --> 18:43.000
WHEW! THANKS FOR
LOOKING OUT FOR MY BIKE.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.767
FROM MY WINDOW,
LOOKED LIKE SOME CLOWNS

18:45.767 --> 18:48.033
WERE ABOUT
TO MESS IT UP.

18:48.033 --> 18:52.000
WELL, I'M JUST GLAD
THAT WE GOT HERE IN TIME.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.400
COME ON, JOEY.
WE GOT APPOINTMENTS.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.200
WHEN HE SAID,
"RAT-FACED,"

18:57.200 --> 18:59.667
WAS THAT, LIKE,
PEJORATIVE?

18:59.667 --> 19:04.500
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS HERE?

19:04.500 --> 19:05.800
NO PROBLEM.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.133
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

19:07.133 --> 19:08.400
WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?

19:08.400 --> 19:12.200
WHY YOU WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH THESE LOWLIFES?

19:12.200 --> 19:13.800
MAYBE I'M A LOWLIFE, TOO.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.867
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK?

19:14.867 --> 19:16.033
THAT'S WHAT
EVERYBODY ELSE THINKS.

19:16.033 --> 19:17.400
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:17.400 --> 19:18.967
I'M OUT HERE WITH A BAT,
AREN'T I?

19:18.967 --> 19:20.600
YEAH!

19:20.600 --> 19:22.800
BUT YOU DIDN'T SWING IT.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.567
'CAUSE CORY CAME ALONG.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.767
YOU THINK
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

19:26.767 --> 19:30.200
THAT YOU HAVE A FRIEND
WHO THINKS SO MUCH OF YOU

19:30.200 --> 19:32.133
THAT HE STUCK
HIS OWN NECK OUT?

19:32.133 --> 19:34.233
LOWLIFES DON'T HAVE
FRIENDS LIKE THAT.

19:36.100 --> 19:38.200
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY DON'T.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.300
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO I AM.

19:40.300 --> 19:43.300
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
YOU'RE SHAWN HUNTER.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.734
YOU WERE
RAISED BY WOLVES.

19:44.734 --> 19:45.800
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.767
IT SAYS SO
IN YOUR BIOGRAPHY.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.567
WHAT ELSE DO YOU
NEED TO KNOW?

19:49.567 --> 19:51.700
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO ME.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.367
YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT.

19:53.367 --> 19:56.233
ALL MATTHEWS CAN DO
IS BE YOUR FRIEND.

19:56.233 --> 19:59.800
SO FAR, HE'S BEEN
DOING A REAL GOOD JOB.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.834
I CAN ONLY TEACH YOU
WHATEVER I CAN

20:02.834 --> 20:05.200
AND HOPE THAT YOU
LEAVE MY CLASS

20:05.200 --> 20:07.200
BETTER THAN
WHEN YOU CAME IN.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.400
CAN YOU DRAG
THE TRAILER PARK TRASH

20:10.400 --> 20:12.100
UP TO DECENT SOCIETY?

20:12.100 --> 20:15.667
IF YOU DON'T KNOW DEEP DOWN
THAT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT,

20:15.667 --> 20:18.367
THEN I HAVEN'T TAUGHT YOU
ANYTHING AT ALL.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.867
YOU THINK I'M ALL RIGHT?

20:20.867 --> 20:23.200
<i>YOU </i>NEED TO THINK
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.500
YOU THINK I'M ALL RIGHT.

20:27.867 --> 20:30.033
IF YOU
PUT YOUR MIND TO IT

20:30.033 --> 20:32.300
AND GET BACK IN SCHOOL

20:32.300 --> 20:35.600
AND NEVER, NEVER
GO NEAR THIS HARLEY

20:35.600 --> 20:37.400
OR THAT HARLEY,

20:37.400 --> 20:41.500
YEAH, I THINK
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.200
MR. TURNER,
DO YOU REALLY THINK
HE'LL BE O.K.?

20:55.734 --> 20:56.767
SURE.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.867
YOU'RE A GOOD SKATER.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.500
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

21:15.500 --> 21:17.500
DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D BELIEVE ME.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.200
WANT TO GO
TO CHUBBY'S?

21:19.200 --> 21:20.367
OOH, A LITTLE FOOD...

21:20.367 --> 21:23.300
HAS NO POWER OVER ME.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.767
ERIC, YOU O.K.?

21:24.767 --> 21:28.500
YEAH, I'M FINE. I HAD
A REALLY BIG LUNCH.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.000
YOU MIND KEEPING ME COMPANY
WHILE I EAT?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.367
YOU CAN HAVE DESSERT.

21:32.367 --> 21:33.700
DESSERT...

21:33.700 --> 21:36.033
IS THE ENEMY
OF MY HIPS.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.800
IF YOU DON'T WANT GO OUT,
JUST SAY SO.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.934
NO. I CAN DO THIS.

21:40.934 --> 21:43.734
LET'S GO TO CHUBBY'S
AND GET SOME FOO...

21:43.734 --> 21:45.500
FAA...

21:45.500 --> 21:47.000
SOME FAAII...

21:47.000 --> 21:49.700
RICK, BUDDY,
YOU LOOKED GREAT
OUT THERE.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.400
WANT A HOT DOG?

21:51.400 --> 21:52.400
AAH!

21:52.400 --> 21:53.500
ALL BEEF!

21:53.500 --> 21:55.000
AAH!
CHILI!

21:55.000 --> 21:56.300
CHEESE!

22:04.400 --> 22:05.900
DINNER?

22:05.900 --> 22:06.800
LOVE TO.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.300
ALL RIGHT.

22:08.300 --> 22:11.767
YOU KNOW,
I TAUGHT ERIC
HOW TO SKATE.

22:11.767 --> 22:13.700
DID YOU?
