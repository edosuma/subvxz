15:19.452 --> 15:21.854
YANKEE.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.391
WHY, I DECLARE, JUST
STANDING NEXT TO YOU

15:24.457 --> 15:26.259
MAKES ME FEEL FAINT.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.244
MYRTLE, ARE YOU OKAY?

15:44.311 --> 15:46.579
I GUESS, I'M JUST
TOO HOT TO HANDLE.

15:51.284 --> 15:55.088
MYRTLE, CAN I GIVE YOU
A LITTLE ADVICE,

15:55.155 --> 15:57.624
YOU KNOW,
BELLE TO BELLE?

15:57.690 --> 15:59.326
I'D BE HONORED.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.395
I REALLY LIKE YOU,

16:02.462 --> 16:04.897
AND I THINK
THAT DEEP DOWN,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.799
EDDIE REALLY
LIKES YOU, TOO.

16:06.866 --> 16:09.902
I KNEW IT.
I ABSOLUTELY KNEW IT.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.338
BUT HE'S REAL SHY.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.240
YOU GOT TO BE
MORE AGGRESSIVE.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.408
WELL, WHAT MORE
CAN I DO?

16:15.475 --> 16:20.980
I'VE ABSOLUTELY EMPTIED
MY AMMO CLIP OF SEDUCTION.

16:21.048 --> 16:24.651
WELL, EDDIE ONCE TOLD ME
ABOUT THIS DREAM HE HAD.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.187
OOH, SPILL IT
TO ME, SISTER.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.893
AN INCREDIBLY
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

16:33.960 --> 16:36.063
STEALS INTO HIS ROOM

16:36.129 --> 16:37.997
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT

16:38.065 --> 16:41.034
AND AWAKENS HIM
WITH A KISS.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.935
I'LL DO IT TONIGHT.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.406
I SHALL STEAL INTO
MY BELOVED'S ROOM.

16:46.473 --> 16:51.711
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE
EXPRESSION ON THAT BOY'S FACE.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.080
ME NEITHER.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.439
AAH!

17:41.494 --> 17:43.430
AAH!

17:47.867 --> 17:50.237
[DOG BARKS]

18:56.169 --> 18:57.837
MYRTLE!

18:57.904 --> 18:59.105
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:59.172 --> 19:01.107
I'M YOUR DREAM
COME TRUE.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.675
AAH! YOU'RE A NIGHTMARE!

19:02.742 --> 19:04.544
NOW, GO HOME!

19:06.213 --> 19:09.048
HAS MY SOUTHERN
SENSUOSITY FRIGHTENED YOU?

19:09.115 --> 19:10.750
STOP THAT!

19:10.817 --> 19:12.485
HEY, HEY!

19:12.552 --> 19:14.454
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE?

19:14.521 --> 19:16.623
UNFORTUNATELY NOT MUCH.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.560
KEEP HER AWAY.
SHE'S CRAZY.

19:20.627 --> 19:24.231
CRAZY ABOUT YOU,
YOU BIG HUNK OF HOMINY.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.700
BUT TO CONTINUE
CHASING AFTER YOU

19:27.767 --> 19:30.537
WOULD BE HUMILIATING
AND UNWORTHY OF AN URKEL.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.575
I, SIR, AM A LADY.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.551
AAH!

19:47.820 --> 19:49.456
A GRAPPLING HOOK?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.591
OH, SHOOT.
I BROKE A NAIL.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.764
DID YOU ENJOY
YOUR KISS, DUMPLING?

19:57.830 --> 19:59.266
YOU SET ME UP.

19:59.332 --> 20:03.703
LITTLE OL' ME? WHY,
WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

20:03.770 --> 20:05.204
HOLD IT, YOU TWO.

20:05.272 --> 20:08.908
LAURA, DID YOU ENCOURAGE
MYRTLE TO COME UP HERE?

20:08.975 --> 20:09.976
WELL, YES.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.378
ONLY
TO GET EVEN.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.280
EDDIE TOLD STEVE
TO SERENADE ME.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.248
I DON'T CARE,
WHAT EDWARD DID.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.949
YOUR BEHAVIOR IS INEXCUSABLE

20:17.016 --> 20:18.485
YEAH.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.487
YOU STARTED
ALL OF THIS?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.322
YEAH.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.925
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT YOU'RE
BEING MEAN TO EACH OTHER,

20:25.992 --> 20:27.794
BUT YOU'RE BRINGING
STEVE AND MYRTLE INTO THIS.

20:27.860 --> 20:31.230
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU USED
THEM AND HURT THEIR FEELINGS.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.799
TOMORROW WHEN
STEVE GETS BACK,

20:32.865 --> 20:36.369
I WANT YOU TO APOLOGIZE TO
HIM AND MYRTLE. UNDERSTOOD?

20:36.436 --> 20:37.904
YES, MOM.
YES, MOM.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.775
I'M ASHAMED
OF YOU TWO.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.447
THAT HURTS.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.415
YEP.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.351
BUT AT LEAST
WE'RE NOT GROUNDED.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.521
BY THE WAY,
YOU TWO ARE GROUNDED.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.429
I'M REALLY SORRY,
MYRTLE.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.997
I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.232
I SEE.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.702
AND, STEVE.
I'M SORRY, TOO.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.438
MM-HMM.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.840
SO YOU THINK YOU GUYS
CAN FORGIVE US?

21:13.906 --> 21:15.241
COUSIN STEVE AND I

21:15.308 --> 21:17.810
NEED TO CHEW ON THAT
ONE FOR A SPELL.

21:19.446 --> 21:24.951
IT'S YOUR WAY, WE'LL
BE IN THE LIVING ROOM.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.389
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

21:29.456 --> 21:31.057
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

21:31.123 --> 21:34.927
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT EDDIE
AND LAURA USED US.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.863
AND ABUSED US.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.866
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU?

21:39.932 --> 21:42.369
I MOST CERTAINLY DO.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.804
THEY LOVE US!
THEY LOVE US!

21:46.606 --> 21:51.043
EDDIE, DO YOU REALIZE THERE
ARE TWO URKELS IN THE KITCHEN?

21:51.110 --> 21:52.178
YEAH.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.914
BUT AT LEAST MINE'S
GOING HOME SOON.

22:02.922 --> 22:03.890
LAURA.

22:03.956 --> 22:04.924
EDDIE.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.526
WE TALKED IT OVER...

22:06.593 --> 22:09.228
AND WE DECIDED THAT...

22:09.295 --> 22:13.466
WE FORGIVE YOU!
WE FORGIVE YOU!

22:13.533 --> 22:16.503
AND THERE'S MORE GOOD NEWS.
TELL THEM, MYRTLE.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.970
I'M TRYING TO
TALK BIG DADDY

22:18.037 --> 22:19.472
INTO SELLING
URKEL OAKS

22:19.539 --> 22:23.510
SO WE CAN
MOVE UP HERE.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.578
THEN WE'LL ALL
BE TOGETHER...

22:25.645 --> 22:28.014
FOREVER!
FOREVER!
