07:29.032 --> 07:31.118
sparring a few rounds

07:31.159 --> 07:32.327
with George Foreman, you know?

07:32.369 --> 07:33.912
That is, if old

07:32.369 --> 07:33.912
George can handle

07:33.954 --> 07:35.830
my famous

07:33.954 --> 07:35.830
one-two combination.

07:35.872 --> 07:39.584
Hoo ha! Hyah!

07:39.626 --> 07:43.588
Danny, The Golden Girls could

07:39.626 --> 07:43.588
handle your one-two combination.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.300
Joey, we saved this last brownie

07:43.630 --> 07:46.300
for you. Don't you want it?

07:46.341 --> 07:47.426
No, thank you.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.760
Are you sure?

07:48.802 --> 07:51.388
The man said "no."

07:53.974 --> 07:55.558
Actually, girls,

07:53.974 --> 07:55.558
I'm saving my appetite.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.935
You see, next to

07:55.600 --> 07:56.935
the Civic Center

07:56.977 --> 07:59.104
is the world's greatest

07:56.977 --> 07:59.104
sandwich shop.

07:59.146 --> 08:03.108
El Bloato's, home of

07:59.146 --> 08:03.108
the sloppy two-footer. Ha ha.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.694
Yep, sounds like good eatin'.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.238
Hey, everybody,

08:06.736 --> 08:08.238
I finished my speech.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.364
Oh, great. Let's hear it.

08:09.406 --> 08:10.740
No, no, no.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.993
I will give no speech

08:10.782 --> 08:12.993
before it's time.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.494
I can't wait

08:13.034 --> 08:14.494
to get up there, man.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.455
The spotlight hits me,

08:14.535 --> 08:16.455
and I look out and see

08:16.496 --> 08:19.082
all those people who thought

08:16.496 --> 08:19.082
I'd never make it, and I..

08:19.124 --> 08:20.959
Get a picture.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.336
Okay, everybody, let's roll.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.379
Jesse and Rebecca,

08:22.377 --> 08:24.379
you go with Joey

08:24.421 --> 08:25.505
'and Steph and Michelle,

08:24.421 --> 08:25.505
you ride with me.'

08:25.546 --> 08:26.965
You're gonna love this trip.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.925
I got a brand new tape,

08:27.007 --> 08:28.925
I sent away for it

08:28.967 --> 08:30.302
great TV show themes.

08:30.344 --> 08:33.096
It has my favorite on it,

08:30.344 --> 08:33.096
"Bonanza."

08:33.138 --> 08:35.015
[hums "Bonanza"]

08:37.184 --> 08:39.144
Danny, Danny, Danny,

08:37.184 --> 08:39.144
please, please, please, please.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.854
I hate that song.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.481
When I was a kid, my dentist

08:40.895 --> 08:42.481
used to always hum that

08:42.563 --> 08:43.773
when he was drilling me.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.985
Every time I hear it,

08:43.815 --> 08:46.985
it kills my teeth.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.529
I'm sorry. Guess I struck

08:47.027 --> 08:49.529
a nerve. Ha ha ha!

08:50.571 --> 08:52.782
Okay, let's roll.

08:52.824 --> 08:53.950
Wait.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.619
Why are we going in two cars?

08:56.661 --> 08:59.456
Because we can't

08:56.661 --> 08:59.456
all fit in one car.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.333
We can all fit in the subway.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.460
It's better for the planet.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.420
Well, that's a good idea.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.420
We'll take the muni.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.629
And besides, it doesn't matter.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.465
Let's take a car,

09:06.671 --> 09:08.465
truck, pogo stick.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.842
People, we got to go. I've a

09:08.507 --> 09:10.842
very important speech to get to.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.135
We're out of here.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.553
[hums "Bonanza"]

09:17.224 --> 09:20.185
[hums "Pomp and Circumstance"]

09:28.485 --> 09:31.238
Alright, come on,

09:28.485 --> 09:31.238
everybody. Find a seat.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.240
Next stop, my graduation.

09:36.368 --> 09:39.037
Daddy, you have

09:36.368 --> 09:39.037
a funny mustache.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.788
Michelle, you know

09:39.079 --> 09:40.788
I don't have no mustache.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.123
You do in that picture.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.546
[laughing]

09:49.881 --> 09:51.758
Oh, that's disgraceful.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.011
Come on, Michelle,

09:53.552 --> 09:55.011
let's go sit over here.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.055
- Girls, wait a second--

09:55.053 --> 09:57.055
- I'll go sit with them.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.432
Thanks.

10:02.561 --> 10:05.397
Excuse me. Can I get in here?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.317
Excuse me.

10:18.743 --> 10:22.663
Excuse me, sir.

10:18.743 --> 10:22.663
Littering is bad for the Earth.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.125
And what are you,

10:22.705 --> 10:25.125
the planet monitor?

10:25.166 --> 10:28.962
No, but I would like to be.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.756
Michelle, he's not

10:29.003 --> 10:31.756
going to listen to a kid.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.008
Joey, tell this guy

10:31.798 --> 10:34.008
not to litter.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.969
Yeah, tell him, Joey.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.387
"Yeah, tell him, Joey."

10:48.982 --> 10:50.691
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

10:50.733 --> 10:53.778
You're Danny Tanner

10:50.733 --> 10:53.778
from "Wake up, San Francisco."

10:53.820 --> 10:55.322
How did you recognize him

10:53.820 --> 10:55.322
without the mustache?

10:57.491 --> 10:59.867
And you're Rebecca Donaldson.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.287
I must say you're even

10:59.909 --> 11:02.287
prettier in person.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.122
Oh, thank you.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.041
Actually, I meant Danny.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.794
Oh, thank you.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.212
Don't hate me

11:09.836 --> 11:11.212
because I am beautiful.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.757
[tapping]

11:23.057 --> 11:24.683
Sorry.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.769
I'm just pumped up, you know?

11:26.811 --> 11:29.856
Get this, I'm graduating

11:26.811 --> 11:29.856
high school tonight.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.399
Yeah, can you imagine? Me?

11:31.441 --> 11:33.652
And guess what? They asked

11:31.441 --> 11:33.652
me to give the big speech.

11:33.692 --> 11:34.986
I mean, when I was a kid

11:35.028 --> 11:37.113
I ditched so much,

11:35.028 --> 11:37.113
they retired my excuse note.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.867
Thanks for sharing.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.871
Are you nuts?

11:44.912 --> 11:47.374
Steven Seagal could

11:44.912 --> 11:47.374
beat up Van Damme any day.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.501
I'm telling you, grandma.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.213
Yeah, I'm watching

11:50.918 --> 11:53.213
the little crumb gobblers.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.964
'I got 'em finger painting.'

11:59.052 --> 12:01.471
I don't see what the big

11:59.052 --> 12:01.471
deal is with babysitting.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.473
You give the sawed-off

12:01.513 --> 12:03.473
baloney eaters a project

12:03.515 --> 12:05.225
and then check in

12:03.515 --> 12:05.225
on them every few days.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.726
Aah!

12:09.688 --> 12:10.980
Sorry, grandma.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.110
[snoring]

12:17.778 --> 12:20.739
Psst. Joey.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.739
That guy's sleeping on you.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.202
Gee, I didn't notice.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.373
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.583
Wake up, big guy!

12:34.295 --> 12:35.463
Top of the morning.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.897
Hey, why are we slowing down?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.482
There's no stop here.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.482
Why are we stopping?

12:56.359 --> 12:57.818
I'm gonna be late

12:56.359 --> 12:57.818
for my graduation.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.945
Joey, what's going on?

12:58.986 --> 13:01.197
Ah, Jess, listen, don't panic.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.865
I ride these trains

13:01.239 --> 13:02.865
all the time.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.242
The only way

13:02.907 --> 13:04.242
we're gonna be stuck

13:04.284 --> 13:06.244
is if we have some kind

13:04.284 --> 13:06.244
of electrical problem.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.038
[electricity crackling]

13:09.080 --> 13:11.249

13:11.291 --> 13:14.085
'It seems we've got some

13:11.291 --> 13:14.085
kind of electrical problem.'

13:18.005 --> 13:20.341
Why don't I...go

13:18.005 --> 13:20.341
sit next to the big guy?

13:20.383 --> 13:22.176
I might be a little safer there.

13:24.262 --> 13:27.014
I can't believe it.

13:24.262 --> 13:27.014
I've got 20 minutes to make it.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.642
Jess, just relax.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.060
This kinda stuff only

13:28.683 --> 13:31.060
usually lasts a couple minutes.

13:31.102 --> 13:35.440
fairly significant delay here.'

13:35.482 --> 13:37.317
Of course, sometimes there's a

13:35.482 --> 13:37.317
fairly significant delay here.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.154
This is great. I'm gonna

13:39.068 --> 13:41.154
miss my whole graduation.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.947

Let's get this crate moving

14:00.757 --> 14:03.510

14:03.551 --> 14:05.178
Jess, you already are yelling

14:05.219 --> 14:07.221
and it's not gonna get us

14:05.219 --> 14:07.221
to your graduation any sooner.

Neither is this train.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.224

An interview with

15:33.266 --> 15:35.184

15:35.226 --> 15:37.437
would be a much stronger piece.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.063
Excuse me.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.815
I couldn't help over hearing

15:40.857 --> 15:43.484
because I was listening

15:40.857 --> 15:43.484
pretty intently.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.487
And I really like

15:43.526 --> 15:46.487
Danny's boxing idea.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.030
There you have it, Beck.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.407
We should listen to

15:48.072 --> 15:49.407
our fans more often.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.284
You know, we forgot

15:49.449 --> 15:51.284
how tuned in they are.

15:53.286 --> 15:57.707
Sorry...I've got to

15:53.286 --> 15:57.707
take this call.

Ben? Ben Franklin.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.047
There you go. She tuned in

16:02.629 --> 16:05.047
enough for you, Danny?

16:06.507 --> 16:08.342
Ben, we're fine and you?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.971
Oh.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.348
Oh, you know,

16:12.012 --> 16:14.348
if you'll excuse us

16:14.390 --> 16:16.392
I think we're

16:14.390 --> 16:16.392
gonna be moving along.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.478
I believe some seats

16:16.434 --> 16:18.478
just opened up in reality.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.524
Oh, honey,

16:21.731 --> 16:23.524
what did you find out?

16:23.566 --> 16:27.695
It's a $27 fine to hitchhike

16:23.566 --> 16:27.695
in a subway tunnel.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.530
Eh, it's no use.

16:29.572 --> 16:32.450
Graduation's starting right now.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.910
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.918
Dad, isn't there

16:39.707 --> 16:41.918
something we can do?

16:44.337 --> 16:45.755
Yes, there is, honey.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.343
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.928
(Danny)

16:50.384 --> 16:51.928
'I'm-I'm sorry to bother you'

16:51.970 --> 16:55.014
but, uh, my brother-in-law here

16:55.055 --> 16:58.100
just missed his high school

16:55.055 --> 16:58.100
graduation ceremony

16:58.142 --> 17:01.187
and he's feeling

16:58.142 --> 17:01.187
really low and..

17:01.228 --> 17:02.730
...we're all

17:01.228 --> 17:02.730
on a subway together

17:02.772 --> 17:05.566
so, you know,

17:02.772 --> 17:05.566
it's even lower than low.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.694
(Danny)

17:05.608 --> 17:07.694
But, you know, sometimes in life

17:07.735 --> 17:09.028
we get a chance

17:07.735 --> 17:09.028
to lift the spirits

17:09.069 --> 17:11.155
of a fellow human being and..

17:11.197 --> 17:12.573
...this is one of those times.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.868
What do you say,

17:12.615 --> 17:14.868
right here, right now.

17:14.909 --> 17:17.036

17:14.909 --> 17:17.036

17:29.256 --> 17:30.800
Danny, sit down.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.218

17:32.259 --> 17:33.970
Now, I'm depressed

17:32.259 --> 17:33.970
and embarrassed.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.349
Oh, sweetheart..

17:38.391 --> 17:39.767
...I know that

17:38.391 --> 17:39.767
you're disappointed

17:39.809 --> 17:41.227
because you're missing

17:39.809 --> 17:41.227
your graduation

17:41.268 --> 17:43.312
but...you're still gonna

17:41.268 --> 17:43.312
get your diploma.

17:43.354 --> 17:44.731
Oh, come on, honey,

17:43.354 --> 17:44.731
don't you understand?

17:44.772 --> 17:45.899
Right now they're

17:44.772 --> 17:45.899
calling my name

17:45.940 --> 17:46.900
to come up on that stage

17:46.941 --> 17:48.067
and give that important speech

17:48.108 --> 17:49.777
and you know what,

17:48.108 --> 17:49.777
I'm not there.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.404
And all my teachers

17:49.819 --> 17:51.404
and my principals are saying

17:51.445 --> 17:52.697
"Yeah, he messed up again.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.448
That's the Katsopolis

17:52.739 --> 17:54.448

17:56.450 --> 17:59.412
Uncle Jesse,

17:56.450 --> 17:59.412
I'm sorry you're sad.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.916
Ah, that's okay, shorty.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.167
I guess I'm just not

18:02.957 --> 18:05.167
the graduating type, huh?

18:09.380 --> 18:11.424
Dude, I hear you.

18:11.465 --> 18:14.761
School's a waste.

18:11.465 --> 18:14.761
That's why I dropped out.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.972
Smartest move I ever made.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.348
You got any spare change?

18:21.726 --> 18:23.061
Oh, yeah, you're doing good.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.395
Hey, it's better

18:23.102 --> 18:24.395
than being in school

18:24.437 --> 18:26.022
reading books

18:24.437 --> 18:26.022
by a bunch of dead guys.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.360
Some of those books

18:28.816 --> 18:31.360
are cool, man.

18:31.402 --> 18:32.403
You ever read Shakespeare?

18:32.445 --> 18:36.699
I don't know. Who wrote it?

18:36.741 --> 18:39.285
Go back to school

18:36.741 --> 18:39.285
as fast as you can.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.327
Run if you have to.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.746
Hey..

18:41.788 --> 18:44.248
...I didn't jump

18:41.788 --> 18:44.248
the turnstile to listen to this.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.501
You know what, man,

18:46.166 --> 18:47.501

18:47.543 --> 18:48.711
and I know where you're going.

That's nowhere.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.257

18:53.299 --> 18:55.259
School is hard, dude.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.929
"School is hard, dude."

18:57.971 --> 18:59.305
Life is hard, man.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.724
I mean...am I right,

18:59.346 --> 19:01.724
is life hard?

19:01.766 --> 19:03.726
- You better believe it.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.726
- You listen to this man.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.561

19:03.768 --> 19:05.561
do it for you, am I right?

Yeah.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.817

19:10.858 --> 19:13.027
See, it's, uh, it's like I

19:10.858 --> 19:13.027
was gonna say in my speech.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.695
You know I had

19:13.069 --> 19:14.695
this whole thing worked out

19:14.737 --> 19:17.782
about once you start something,

19:14.737 --> 19:17.782
you gotta stick to it.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.199
My kids are so cool, man.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.952
They been playing with

19:19.241 --> 19:20.952
this Elvis puzzle all week.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.703
They couldn't get it, they keep

19:20.994 --> 19:22.703
trying, they keep trying

19:22.745 --> 19:24.956
they keep trying and guess what?

19:22.745 --> 19:24.956
Today they get it.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.374
They get their last piece.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.374
Elvis' left sideburn.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.253
They were so proud

19:28.584 --> 19:31.253
of themselves.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.505
Don't you want to know

19:31.295 --> 19:32.505
what that feels like?

19:32.546 --> 19:35.091
Don't you wanna be

19:32.546 --> 19:35.091
proud about something?

19:35.133 --> 19:38.052
Guess that would be

19:35.133 --> 19:38.052
nice for a change.

19:38.094 --> 19:41.764
Listen, man, I know where you

19:38.094 --> 19:41.764
come from. I was just like you.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.016
Dropped out of school

19:43.057 --> 19:45.184
rode my Harley,

19:43.057 --> 19:45.184
gigged with a band.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.894
I thought I was so cool.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.147
But when I was alone

19:46.936 --> 19:49.147
and I looked in that mirror..

19:49.188 --> 19:50.690
...something was wrong.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.734
I mean, sure, my hair looked

19:50.731 --> 19:53.734
great and everything but..

19:53.776 --> 19:56.112
...something was missing.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.112
I didn't feel right inside.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.738
You know what was missing?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.406
My diploma.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.701

20:01.742 --> 20:04.453

20:04.495 --> 20:06.622
Yeah, but I can't go back now.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.709

20:09.750 --> 20:12.545
