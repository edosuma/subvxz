So if you could squeeze

08:04.651 --> 08:07.528
in just one little miracle

08:07.570 --> 08:09.072
I'd be a happy camper.

08:14.535 --> 08:15.829
D.J., you were great.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.331
That kid was twice

08:15.870 --> 08:17.331
your size.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.749
Thanks, dad, but next time

08:17.372 --> 08:19.749
I win a match..

08:19.791 --> 08:21.460
...don't try

08:19.791 --> 08:21.460
and start a wave.

08:27.548 --> 08:30.760
Ooh, I'm glad I'm not

08:27.548 --> 08:30.760
a part of this.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.929
You're back already?

08:30.802 --> 08:32.929
Look, do me a favor.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.682
Whatever you do, keep your pop

08:32.971 --> 08:35.682
out of this kitchen for, say..

08:35.723 --> 08:37.184
...three or four days, huh?

08:38.143 --> 08:40.270
Work fast,

08:38.143 --> 08:40.270
maybe I can give you

08:40.312 --> 08:41.771
three or four minutes.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.026
D.J., I'm gonna

08:44.774 --> 08:46.026
go start dinner.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.902
Uh, dad, let's go

08:47.944 --> 08:49.779
have some Chinese food.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.615
Okay. Why don't we go

08:49.821 --> 08:52.615
to Chinatown?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.493
We always go to Chinatown.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.994
Let's go to China.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.289
I'll go get the menu.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.289
We'll call for takeout.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.541
Uh, dad, don't go in there.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.001
[chuckles]

09:05.795 --> 09:08.382
Why did you

09:05.795 --> 09:08.382
let me go in there?

09:08.423 --> 09:10.800
Could have gone to China.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.678
[whistling]

09:13.720 --> 09:15.847
Hi, pally, how are you?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.058
Uh, you'd probably like

09:18.099 --> 09:19.684
an explanation,

09:18.099 --> 09:19.684
wouldn't you?

09:22.187 --> 09:24.523
What has happened

09:22.187 --> 09:24.523
is, uh, I went to

09:24.605 --> 09:26.358
the hardware store to buy

09:24.605 --> 09:26.358
a new handle, right?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.068
But the design

09:26.400 --> 09:28.068
was discontinued.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.694
So I got

09:28.109 --> 09:29.694
a whole new set, see.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.446
I got this whole new set.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.446
Pretty decorative, huh?

09:34.282 --> 09:36.659
Yeah, well, uh, see,

09:34.282 --> 09:36.659
and-and then what happened was

09:36.701 --> 09:38.870
the screws were too fat, I mean,

09:36.701 --> 09:38.870
I got a bunch of fat screws

09:38.912 --> 09:40.539
so I had to make the holes

09:38.912 --> 09:40.539
bigger so I'm drilling

09:40.580 --> 09:42.790
thus in turn breaking

09:40.580 --> 09:42.790
the veneer on the fronts here

09:42.832 --> 09:44.667
so I had to put whole new

09:42.832 --> 09:44.667
fronts on the drawers.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.715
Those? You're wondering

09:48.213 --> 09:50.715
about those?

09:51.716 --> 09:52.800
As well you should.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.135
Um, well, see,

09:52.842 --> 09:54.135
this part

09:54.177 --> 09:55.803
this part makes

09:54.177 --> 09:55.803
perfect sense.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.638
Because what happened here,

09:55.845 --> 09:57.638
the cabinets and the drawers

09:57.680 --> 09:58.932
have to match.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.932
You know, cabinets, drawers.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.641
Cabinets, drawers,

09:58.973 --> 10:00.641
so what I did was..

10:00.683 --> 10:02.894
...I got new fittings,

10:00.683 --> 10:02.894
but they didn't fit, see.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.479
Fronts didn't fit

10:02.936 --> 10:04.479
so I had to shave them.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.356
So when you walked in

10:04.521 --> 10:06.356
I'm shaving, I'm whistling

10:06.398 --> 10:07.524
I'm shaving,

10:06.398 --> 10:07.524
I'm whistling, you walk..

10:07.566 --> 10:09.150
I swear I'll clean

10:07.566 --> 10:09.150
it all up.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.487
Everything was

10:10.318 --> 10:12.487
all cleaned up.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.030
How could you do this to me?

10:14.072 --> 10:15.615
On my day!

10:15.656 --> 10:17.492
This is my Christmas!

10:20.620 --> 10:21.955
Don't like the new handles?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.916
Please, please.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.916
I looked everywhere.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.501
I'm telling you,

10:24.958 --> 10:26.501
he was kidnapped.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.544
Slow down.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.379
Everything's gonna be okay.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.131
Now, who was kidnapped?

10:31.172 --> 10:32.966
My best friend

10:31.172 --> 10:32.966
in the whole world.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.426
Mr. Bear.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.885
Let me get some information.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.638
Now, does Mr. Bear

10:35.927 --> 10:38.638
have a first name?

10:38.679 --> 10:41.600
Teddy. He's exactly

10:38.679 --> 10:41.600
this tall.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.768
Brown hat, gray trench coat

10:43.810 --> 10:45.728
brown snout.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.606
This Mr. Bear

10:47.688 --> 10:50.150
he's a stuffed animal,

10:47.688 --> 10:50.150
isn't he?

10:50.191 --> 10:52.569
Well, technically.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.493
You called the police 'cause

10:57.532 --> 10:59.493
I messed up your kitchen?

11:02.412 --> 11:03.704
I swear, officer,

11:02.412 --> 11:03.704
what happened was

11:03.746 --> 11:05.081
the design

11:03.746 --> 11:05.081
was discontinued, right?

11:05.123 --> 11:06.583
So I put a new thing,

11:05.123 --> 11:06.583
I'm doing new holes.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.002
It breaks. I'm shaving it

11:06.625 --> 11:09.002
when he walks in.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.296
Jesse, I didn't

11:09.043 --> 11:11.296
call the police.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.340
- Oh.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.340
- Officer, what's the problem?

11:13.381 --> 11:14.633
This little girl

11:13.381 --> 11:14.633
flagged me down

11:14.673 --> 11:16.884
to report a missing bear.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.637
Brown hat,

11:16.926 --> 11:18.637
gray trench coat

11:18.677 --> 11:19.971
brown snout.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.390
Uh, Steph, I think I know

11:22.432 --> 11:24.309
what might have happened.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.603
I may have accidentally

11:24.351 --> 11:26.603
put Mr. Bear

11:26.645 --> 11:28.729
in the bag of toys

11:26.645 --> 11:28.729
that we gave to charity.

11:29.730 --> 11:30.898
I tried to track him down

11:30.940 --> 11:32.442
but they've already

11:30.940 --> 11:32.442
been given away.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.111
You gave away Mr. Bear?

11:35.153 --> 11:37.322
Officer, arrest this man.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.200
Steph, I'm really sorry.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.327
How could you do this to me?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.630
[instrumental music]

11:59.969 --> 12:01.054
[instrumental music]

12:03.223 --> 12:06.100
[music continues]

12:06.142 --> 12:08.769
Steph, how many of those

12:06.142 --> 12:08.769
posters are you gonna to make?

12:08.811 --> 12:11.814
I'm gonna put one on every

12:08.811 --> 12:11.814
telephone pole in America.

12:11.856 --> 12:15.109
I've got to find Mr. Bear.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.444
Steph, why don't we try

12:15.151 --> 12:16.444
talking about

12:16.486 --> 12:18.488
something else

12:16.486 --> 12:18.488
besides Mr. Bear?

12:19.573 --> 12:21.616
Okay. Let's talk

12:19.573 --> 12:21.616
about Joey.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.410
Why did he give

12:21.658 --> 12:23.410
away Mr. Bear?

12:24.578 --> 12:27.414
Don't blame Joey.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.414
Accidents happen.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.250
Like, remember the time

12:27.455 --> 12:30.250
you lost my pillow person?

12:30.291 --> 12:31.750
He was so cute.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.379
He had dangling

12:31.792 --> 12:34.379
arms and legs.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.754
I was mad at you

12:34.421 --> 12:35.754
for losing him

12:35.796 --> 12:37.048
but then I got over it.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.008
I grew up.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.008
I moved on.

12:41.386 --> 12:44.097
I found your pillow person

12:41.386 --> 12:44.097
under my mattress.

12:44.138 --> 12:48.142
[gasps]

12:44.138 --> 12:48.142
My pillow person!

12:48.184 --> 12:50.853
Oh, I thought I'd never

12:48.184 --> 12:50.853
see you again!

12:53.147 --> 12:55.983
I mean, what

12:53.147 --> 12:55.983
a pleasant surprise.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.363
Hi, girls,

12:57.944 --> 13:00.363
Steph, I feel terrible

13:00.405 --> 13:01.698
about this Mr. Bear thing.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.324
Is there any way

13:01.740 --> 13:03.324
I can make it up to you?

13:03.366 --> 13:05.702
Do you remember

13:03.366 --> 13:05.702
what Mr. Bear looked like?

13:05.744 --> 13:06.953
Well, yeah, sure.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.496
Then grab a crayon.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.915
Pass me a brown.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.294
[instrumental music]

13:15.295 --> 13:17.213
[singing]

13:17.255 --> 13:19.006
(Danny)

13:17.255 --> 13:19.006
'Jesse, do I wanna come

13:17.255 --> 13:19.006
in there?'

13:19.048 --> 13:20.634
Yup, come on in.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.634
You're gonna love it.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.348
Huh?

13:27.390 --> 13:28.849
Ha?

13:30.935 --> 13:32.353
Well?

13:32.395 --> 13:34.188
I do love it.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.523
This is great.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.525
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:37.567 --> 13:39.611
Never hug me in front

13:37.567 --> 13:39.611
of my power tools.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.863
Stephanie, come meet

13:40.819 --> 13:42.863
some new friends.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.449
Stephanie's on her way down.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.075
Aww, there's my baby.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.453
Give grandma

13:46.117 --> 13:48.453
a great, big kiss.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.122
Toys!

13:51.164 --> 13:52.999
Nice seeing you

13:51.164 --> 13:52.999
too, sweetheart.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.795
My bear.

13:56.835 --> 13:58.421
Oh, no, honey.

13:58.463 --> 14:01.257
Stephanie picks

13:58.463 --> 14:01.257
first, okay?

14:01.299 --> 14:02.550
I hope this works.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.177
Steph's really taking

14:02.592 --> 14:04.177
this hard.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.928
You know I realize that

14:04.218 --> 14:05.928
she's attached to this thing.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.764
But I mean, come on,

14:05.970 --> 14:07.764
it's just a stuffed animal.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.141
Oh, just a stuffed animal?

14:10.183 --> 14:13.770
Do you remember

14:10.183 --> 14:13.770
Doggy Katsopolis?

14:15.938 --> 14:18.899
Not in front

14:15.938 --> 14:18.899
of people, huh?

14:18.941 --> 14:22.236
Doggy Katsopolis?

14:22.278 --> 14:23.738
Yeah, come on, dad,

14:22.278 --> 14:23.738
let's go in the kitchen

14:23.780 --> 14:25.281
and work with our hands,

14:23.780 --> 14:25.281
shall we?

14:25.323 --> 14:26.991
Jesse, you loved that

14:25.323 --> 14:26.991
little stuffed mutt.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.285
You used to throw him

14:27.033 --> 14:29.285
around the room for hours.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.831
I didn't throw him.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.165
He flew.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.918
Your little Doggy Katsopolis

14:35.458 --> 14:37.918
had wings?

14:38.753 --> 14:40.672
Don't be stupid.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.882
He flew by flapping

14:40.714 --> 14:42.882
his little ears.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.719
Hi, grandma. Hi, grandpa.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.136
- 'Hi, honey.'

14:47.178 --> 14:50.431
- Come, honey.

14:47.178 --> 14:50.431
- Mm-mmh.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.726
Look what Grandpa Nick

14:50.473 --> 14:52.726
and I brought you.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.935
Some new friends. Why don't

14:52.767 --> 14:54.935
you go get to know them?

14:54.977 --> 14:58.398
Alright. I'll give

14:54.977 --> 14:58.398
it a try.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.525
Let me ask

14:58.439 --> 15:00.525
you guys a question.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.276
If D.J. was picking on me..

15:02.318 --> 15:03.820
...what would you do?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.531
Anybody?

15:07.699 --> 15:09.367
These guys are duds.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.038
- Hi, Steph.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.038
- You found him!

15:14.080 --> 15:15.373
Uh, Steph,

15:14.080 --> 15:15.373
let me explain--

15:15.415 --> 15:17.876
Mr. Bear, you had me

15:15.415 --> 15:17.876
worried half to..

15:17.917 --> 15:19.753
Who is this?

15:19.794 --> 15:21.671
The real Mr. Bear

15:19.794 --> 15:21.671
had a little scar

15:21.713 --> 15:24.006
where I closed a toy box

15:21.713 --> 15:24.006
on his nose.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.926
This bear is an impostor.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.344
Steph, wait.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.388
I couldn't find

15:28.386 --> 15:30.388
Mr. Bear, but..

15:30.430 --> 15:31.681
...I found Mr. Bear's

15:31.723 --> 15:34.726
successful twin brother,

15:31.723 --> 15:34.726
Dr. Bear.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.688
Sorry, Joey.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.815
Could you take him

15:38.730 --> 15:40.815
back to the store?

15:40.857 --> 15:43.192
Looking at that face

15:40.857 --> 15:43.192
is just too painful.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.574
I tried.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.743
Danny, we gotta snap

15:49.616 --> 15:51.743
the kid out of this.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.202
I can't understand why

15:53.244 --> 15:54.788
she's so attached

15:53.244 --> 15:54.788
to that bear.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.415
Well, I guess we better

15:54.829 --> 15:57.415
bring these back, too.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.958
Too late, grandpa.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.298
My bear!

16:09.051 --> 16:11.971
Steph, I know

16:09.051 --> 16:11.971
you miss Mr. Bear

16:12.012 --> 16:14.056
but it's not like

16:12.012 --> 16:14.056
you're all alone in the world.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.267
You still got us.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.393
I guess so.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.645
Alright, that's it,

16:17.435 --> 16:18.645
young lady

16:18.686 --> 16:20.104
I'm tired of this

16:18.686 --> 16:20.104
moping around.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.231
Now you come out here

16:20.146 --> 16:22.231
and you lay one of those

16:22.273 --> 16:23.775
killer smiles on me, okay?

16:23.817 --> 16:24.901
Come on!

16:25.777 --> 16:27.821
Steph, a real smile.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.864
Mr. Bear would've

16:27.862 --> 16:29.864
wanted you to be happy

16:29.906 --> 16:32.366
because that's the kind

16:29.906 --> 16:32.366
of bear he was, right?

16:32.408 --> 16:34.577
And wherever Mr. Bear went

16:32.408 --> 16:34.577
I'm sure he's bringing

16:34.619 --> 16:36.287
happiness to some other kid.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.957
That's true.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.957
He was very good at that.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.918
He's been making me happy

16:38.998 --> 16:41.918
since I met him.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.253
I remember

16:41.960 --> 16:44.253
the exact day.

16:44.295 --> 16:45.880
It was when mom

16:44.295 --> 16:45.880
came home from the hospital

16:45.922 --> 16:48.174
with our new

16:45.922 --> 16:48.174
baby sister, Michelle.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.050
That's right.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.679
She gave D.J.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.679
a charm bracelet

16:52.720 --> 16:55.473
and she gave you...

16:52.720 --> 16:55.473
Mr. Bear.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.978
Oh, so that's why Mr. Bear

16:57.224 --> 16:59.978
is so important to you

17:00.019 --> 17:02.689
because it was

17:00.019 --> 17:02.689
a present from mom, huh?

17:02.730 --> 17:03.857
Oh, yeah.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.233
I forgot mom

17:03.898 --> 17:06.233
gave me Mr. Bear.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.445
That must be why

17:07.568 --> 17:09.445
I love him so much.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.616
You know..

17:13.658 --> 17:15.702
...after mom died..

17:15.743 --> 17:17.662
...I could remember

17:15.743 --> 17:17.662
everything about her.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.081
How she looked..

17:21.123 --> 17:23.001
...her voice.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.878
The way her perfume smelled.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.673
She used to sing

17:26.420 --> 17:28.673
to us at bedtime.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.177
Now it's getting harder

17:30.925 --> 17:33.177
and harder to remember.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.724
Daddy, am I gonna

17:34.804 --> 17:37.724
forget all about mama?

17:39.099 --> 17:41.101
No, honey.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.688
Listen, at first

17:43.730 --> 17:45.314
after the car accident

17:45.356 --> 17:47.942
we talked about your mom

17:45.356 --> 17:47.942
all the time.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.069
But lately..

17:50.110 --> 17:51.487
...well..

17:51.529 --> 17:52.822
You know, maybe the reason

17:51.529 --> 17:52.822
we haven't talked

17:52.864 --> 17:55.199
about your mom

17:52.864 --> 17:55.199
in a while is because

17:55.241 --> 17:56.242
we're afraid it would bring

17:56.283 --> 17:58.828
all that pain back again.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.580
Maybe so.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.582
You know what, girls,

18:00.621 --> 18:02.582
you know what I do when I..

18:02.623 --> 18:05.543
...start to miss Pam and

18:02.623 --> 18:05.543
I'm feelin' sad and stuff?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.461
I just think about

18:05.585 --> 18:07.461
all the good times.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.173
Ah, she was a great sister.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.593
I remember my first junior

18:11.215 --> 18:13.593
high school dance, right?

18:13.634 --> 18:15.678
Thanks to John Travolta

18:13.634 --> 18:15.678
I had to get a white suit

18:15.720 --> 18:17.013
and learn how

18:15.720 --> 18:17.013
to do the hustle.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.431
[laughing]

18:18.472 --> 18:20.683
She worked with me

18:18.472 --> 18:20.683
the whole weekend.

18:20.725 --> 18:24.103
Forty eight hours of dancing

18:20.725 --> 18:24.103
to "Disco Inferno."

18:25.813 --> 18:27.314
She must've really loved me.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.317
God, I loved her.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.196
Your mom had that great laugh.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.865
It was contagious.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.742
Every time I'd work

18:35.907 --> 18:37.742
on some new material

18:37.784 --> 18:39.326
I'd bring her to the club

18:39.368 --> 18:41.537
use to set her right

18:39.368 --> 18:41.537
in the front row.

18:41.579 --> 18:44.123
Pretty soon,

18:41.579 --> 18:44.123
she'd start laughin'

18:44.164 --> 18:45.833
then she'd have the whole

18:44.164 --> 18:45.833
place crackin' up.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.543
It was great.

18:47.585 --> 18:48.878
I remember

18:47.585 --> 18:48.878
her laugh.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.004
Like every time

18:48.920 --> 18:50.004
we sang

18:50.046 --> 18:52.548
that silly song

18:50.046 --> 18:52.548
with mom.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.383
Oh yeah.

18:54.425 --> 18:57.511
♪ On top of spaghetti ♪

18:57.553 --> 19:00.264
♪ All covered with cheese ♪

19:00.306 --> 19:03.476
♪ I lost my poor meatball ♪

19:03.517 --> 19:05.895
♪ When somebody sneezed ♪♪

19:05.937 --> 19:07.688
- Achoo!

19:07.730 --> 19:08.815
You see?

19:08.856 --> 19:10.149
You girls don't

19:08.856 --> 19:10.149
ever have to worry

19:10.190 --> 19:11.901
about forgetting

19:10.190 --> 19:11.901
your mom

19:11.943 --> 19:13.820
because you can think

19:11.943 --> 19:13.820
about those happy times

19:13.861 --> 19:15.321
whenever you want.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.531
That's right, see, the key

19:15.362 --> 19:17.531
thing is just to keep those

19:17.573 --> 19:19.533
happy memories

19:17.573 --> 19:19.533
of Pam in our hearts.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.869
That way she'll

19:19.575 --> 19:21.869
always be with us.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.455
You know another thing

19:21.911 --> 19:24.455
that helps me remember.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.707
I see so much of Pam

19:24.497 --> 19:26.707
in you three girls.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.585
D.J., everything you do

19:29.627 --> 19:31.545
you try to be

19:29.627 --> 19:31.545
the best at it

19:31.587 --> 19:33.714
that's just like your mom.

19:33.756 --> 19:34.757
What about me?

19:34.799 --> 19:35.925
Well, you know

19:34.799 --> 19:35.925
how you get

19:35.967 --> 19:37.135
so excited

19:35.967 --> 19:37.135
about everything?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.053
Yeah, yeah!

19:39.095 --> 19:42.556
- That's exactly like your mom.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.556
- Alright!

19:42.598 --> 19:44.600
Hey, let's not

19:42.598 --> 19:44.600
forget little Michelle.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.727
Every time I see this kid

19:44.642 --> 19:46.727
giggle I think of Pam.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.228
Brr-r-r!

19:50.023 --> 19:51.732
It's good that we remember mommy

19:51.774 --> 19:54.068
'cause we have to tell Michelle

19:51.774 --> 19:54.068
what she was like.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.866
You know what

19:57.655 --> 19:59.866
I'm thinking, girls

19:59.907 --> 20:01.492
it's been a long time since

19:59.907 --> 20:01.492
we watched those

20:01.534 --> 20:03.995
home movies of Danny's.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.413
What do you say?

20:04.037 --> 20:06.413
You guys wanna go look at 'em?

20:06.455 --> 20:09.125
- Yeah, let's go watch 'em.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.125
- Can we do it now?

20:09.167 --> 20:10.334
Are you kidding?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.170
If spring cleaning

20:10.376 --> 20:12.170
is my Christmas..

20:12.211 --> 20:14.881
...home movies are

20:12.211 --> 20:14.881
my New Year's Eve.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.382
Come on.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.676
I shot this

20:17.508 --> 20:18.676
the day your mom

20:18.718 --> 20:19.886
came home

20:18.718 --> 20:19.886
from the hospital

20:19.927 --> 20:21.762
with Michelle.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.140
Alright, you guys wait

20:21.804 --> 20:24.140
right there. You..

20:24.182 --> 20:25.432
Come on, Danny, get that

20:24.182 --> 20:25.432
thing out of my face.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.143
- 'Smile, Jesse.'

20:25.474 --> 20:27.143
- Cut, please..

20:29.854 --> 20:32.106
Maybe I should grow

20:29.854 --> 20:32.106
my hair long again, huh?

20:32.148 --> 20:33.691
(both)

20:32.148 --> 20:33.691
Nah.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.111
Okay, Pam, you can

20:35.068 --> 20:37.111
come in now.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.781
Hey, anybody order a pizza?

20:41.866 --> 20:43.826
Give me my baby, Joey.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.494
- 'Oh.'

20:43.868 --> 20:45.494
- 'Here.'

20:45.536 --> 20:47.329
You're not a pizza, Michelle.

20:47.371 --> 20:51.375
No, you are a big,

20:47.371 --> 20:51.375
beautiful meatball.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.086
[laughing]

20:53.127 --> 20:54.587
Steph, Deej, don't go away

20:54.628 --> 20:56.214
we got presents for you

20:54.628 --> 20:56.214
out in the car.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.674
- Oh!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.674
- Michelle.

20:58.716 --> 20:59.967
Isn't she pretty?

21:00.009 --> 21:02.803
Mmm, hi, Michelle.

21:02.845 --> 21:04.555
Mom looks like you, D.J.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.099
She looks like you too.

21:07.225 --> 21:09.602
Aw, what a beautiful baby.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.645
Good news, Danny she doesn't

21:09.643 --> 21:11.645
look a thing like you.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.688
[chuckles]

21:12.730 --> 21:13.898
Don't worry,

21:12.730 --> 21:13.898
in a few years

21:13.940 --> 21:16.734
from now you'll laugh

21:13.940 --> 21:16.734
at that.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.277
Wrong.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.824
Danny, get a close-up

21:20.529 --> 21:23.824
of this gorgeous little face.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.246
Not me, the baby. Huh?

21:31.457 --> 21:34.418
(Pam)

21:31.457 --> 21:34.418
'Say, hi, daddy.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.418
Hi, daddy!'

21:34.460 --> 21:37.546
Baby!

21:37.588 --> 21:39.090
Michelle, that's you.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.841
No.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.927
Yes.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.221
Cute baby!

21:45.263 --> 21:47.347
Look there's Mr. Bear!

21:47.389 --> 21:49.349
[imitating bugle]

21:49.391 --> 21:50.977
Mr. Bear!

21:52.645 --> 21:55.189
(Joey)

21:52.645 --> 21:55.189
'In addition to your new

21:52.645 --> 21:55.189
beautiful baby sister'

21:55.231 --> 21:57.024
'you've won something else.'

21:57.066 --> 21:58.609
Presents!

21:58.651 --> 22:00.653
Look how young

21:58.651 --> 22:00.653
Mr. Bear looks.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.411
(Danny)

22:06.450 --> 22:09.411
'Ah, great, Joey,

22:06.450 --> 22:09.411
nice presents.'

22:09.453 --> 22:11.831
Mr. Bear, it's you!

22:11.872 --> 22:13.332
It's really you.

22:13.373 --> 22:15.251
- 'Oh, alright!'

22:13.373 --> 22:15.251
- 'Alright.'

22:15.293 --> 22:17.419
Michelle, did you

22:15.293 --> 22:17.419
hide Mr. Bear?

22:17.461 --> 22:18.963
Yes.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.633
How could you

22:20.422 --> 22:22.633
do this to me?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.302
