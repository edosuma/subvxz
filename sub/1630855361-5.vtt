Fury was on that motorway

18:00.958 --> 18:04.125
If they're not busy gaslighting you,
they're threatening you with murder.

That's what all the podcasts are about.

(SCREAMS)

18:59.250 --> 19:00.500
Professor Davis?

19:38.291 --> 19:40.000
You're the one he sent to kill me?

19:41.041 --> 19:42.125
I'm G'iah.

19:45.875 --> 19:48.125
Fury said you could help me
bury my father.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

19:55.125 --> 19:56.750
How you feeling, Mr. President?

19:58.541 --> 19:59.666
Helpless.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.875
Would you like to change that, sir?

20:03.125 --> 20:04.208
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:04.291 --> 20:08.833
As you no doubt saw with your own eyes,
these Skrulls aided in that attack.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.208
Yeah, I saw.

20:10.916 --> 20:14.750
But the Skrulls are most definitely here.
And they're working with the Russians.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.583
Now, of course,
the Russians are denying this,

20:17.666 --> 20:20.916
but we've received corroborating evidence
from Sonya Falsworth at SIS.

20:22.083 --> 20:23.375
My God.

20:25.125 --> 20:29.583
Now, Mr. President, what you see
on this screen is the Skrull compound.

20:30.041 --> 20:31.416
That's Russian soil.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.791
We have to neutralize this facility.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.000
England is 100% behind us,

20:37.083 --> 20:38.916
as soon as the rest of NATO
sees this proof,

20:39.000 --> 20:40.750
they're gonna be on board too. Believe me.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.708
A strike on Russian soil?

20:44.125 --> 20:45.750
That means World War III.

20:46.666 --> 20:49.625
I would rather us face a war
than extinction.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.583
And that's exactly
what a Skrull invasion will mean.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.791
We have to cut this thing off at the head.

20:57.583 --> 20:58.666
And now.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.666
I was wondering when you were gonna call.

21:05.791 --> 21:08.458
You'd like to think
you're a step ahead of me, Fury.

21:08.958 --> 21:13.000
Ah. You're a jet, and I need rocket fuel
to stay ahead of you.

21:13.208 --> 21:14.500
(CHUCKLES)

21:14.833 --> 21:16.458
I got a deal for you.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.958
Got anything to do with the Harvest?

21:19.541 --> 21:22.250
Bring it to me in person,
I'll call the whole thing off.

21:23.541 --> 21:25.208
FURY: Call what thing off?

21:25.291 --> 21:27.291
GRAVIK: I thought you were
a step ahead of me.

21:27.375 --> 21:29.000
I'm raising the stakes, Fury.

21:29.458 --> 21:33.333
If I don't get what I want,
your President's gonna bomb New Skrullos.

21:33.416 --> 21:34.500
Then the war is on.

21:34.916 --> 21:36.583
And bring some iodide pills.

21:36.666 --> 21:39.416
The reactor room
can be a touch aggressive.

22:02.041 --> 22:04.250
They don't just give those out to anyone.
Kudos.

22:04.333 --> 22:07.041
Yeah, well, Mama always said
I was special.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.375
Yeah, Mama was right.

22:10.083 --> 22:12.541
Feel a lot better
if we were on the Helicarrier.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.583
Yeah, that's been mothballed.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.625
A little bit like you should be.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Oh!

22:18.083 --> 22:20.458
Before I forget, voilà.

22:20.833 --> 22:22.916
Figured you might need that
on the other side.

22:27.083 --> 22:28.083
You're welcome.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.625
Oh, and try and get a nap.
You seem a little grumpy.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.416
He was our general.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.583
He deserves a procession of mourners.

22:49.291 --> 22:51.375
Talos wasn't much for pageantry.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.041
Do you have the offering?

23:10.083 --> 23:11.291
G'IAH: It was my mother's.

23:18.333 --> 23:19.541
I don't know the prayer.

23:21.666 --> 23:23.708
It's okay. I know it.

23:47.375 --> 23:48.583
(IN SKRULL LANGUAGE)

23:58.291 --> 24:00.250
(IN ENGLISH) I told him he was a failure.

24:01.833 --> 24:04.250
What kind of daughter
says that to her father?

24:05.583 --> 24:09.541
The kind that intends to make it up to him
the next time she sees him.

24:11.875 --> 24:15.041
The last thing I said to Fury
before the Snap was,

24:15.125 --> 24:18.958
"If you keep spending all your time
chasing aliens,

24:19.041 --> 24:21.208
"you might lose the one you married."

24:21.625 --> 24:23.166
(CHUCKLES)

24:28.666 --> 24:30.416
Why does Gravik want to kill you?

24:32.083 --> 24:33.625
Insubordination, I guess.

24:34.708 --> 24:36.416
And yet you decided to obey the order

24:36.500 --> 24:39.541
that says you have to wait around here
for your execution.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.083
The thing is, I love this house.

24:44.416 --> 24:49.958
Loved it ever since I first set foot in it
on a viewing 15 years ago.

24:50.041 --> 24:51.333
With Fury?

24:51.416 --> 24:52.666
With Fury in mind.

24:53.541 --> 24:57.583
I wasn't sure if he'd ever commit
to calling any one place home,

24:57.666 --> 24:59.500
let alone any place with me.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.916
But I figured if I was gonna give it
a fighting chance,

25:03.000 --> 25:07.375
I'd need to find a place that offered
the three things he valued most.

25:08.416 --> 25:13.541
Lots of privacy, lots of security,
and lots of...

25:13.625 --> 25:14.666
Leather.

25:15.250 --> 25:16.416
Light.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.708
He'd sit there by the window,
reading a book.

25:22.666 --> 25:25.208
Letting the sun kiss his skin.

25:25.750 --> 25:30.291
And I'd get lost,
just watching him like that for hours.

watching you in your own skin?

25:36.916 --> 25:38.916
-That's none of your business.
-Well, I...

25:39.750 --> 25:42.208
-I didn't mean to offend.
-Of course you did.

You're young,
you think you know everything.

He asked for corroboration
on the New Skrullos site.

for the Super Skrull machine.

than I could ever hope to be.
