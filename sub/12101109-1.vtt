00:24.127 --> 00:25.749
Fields.

00:27.441 --> 00:29.615
Chris.

00:48.496 --> 00:51.396
Sorry to ruin
your evening, boss.

00:51.430 --> 00:52.914
We just had a call
from a CHIS Handler

00:52.949 --> 00:55.331
submitting information
relevant to Vella.

00:55.365 --> 00:57.402
-What did they say?
-Possible suspect.

00:57.436 --> 00:59.404
A person so far unknown
to the inquiry,

00:59.438 --> 01:01.854
alleged to have made
a confession.

01:01.889 --> 01:05.548
-Intels's graded the info 1
-A
on the matrix.

01:05.582 --> 01:07.550
Okay.

01:07.584 --> 01:10.208
Continue developing the intel.

01:10.242 --> 01:11.623
Let's bring the suspect in.

01:11.657 --> 01:14.350
Nice one.
Right on it, boss.

01:14.384 --> 01:16.455
Five Three, the boss
has given the go ahead

01:16.490 --> 01:17.767
on the 2 ARVs fully crewed

01:17.801 --> 01:20.597
with AFOs and TL
within the hour.

01:22.703 --> 01:25.188
<i>Sorry to call you in, sir.</i>

01:25.223 --> 01:26.879
Any progress since we spoke
on the phone?

01:26.914 --> 01:28.778
We've a possible location
for the Suspect.

01:28.812 --> 01:30.228
You okay to sign off

01:30.262 --> 01:31.953
the Directed Surveillance
Authority?

01:31.988 --> 01:33.955
I need a team on watch while
we pull everything together

01:33.990 --> 01:36.372
-to raid the premises.
-How reliable is the intel?

01:36.406 --> 01:38.477
1A from an established CHIS.

01:38.512 --> 01:39.892
Casual sex worker.

01:39.927 --> 01:41.687
He supplied
the Suspect's address...

01:41.722 --> 01:43.344
Hold on, Jo.

01:43.379 --> 01:45.208
-A rent boy?
-I don't know

01:45.243 --> 01:47.383
if it's a commercial thing
with the CHIS

01:47.417 --> 01:48.763
or even what his drugs
history is.

01:48.798 --> 01:51.318
Christ sake, Jo,
he was probably off his face.

01:51.352 --> 01:53.216
Look, just let me get
a coffee inside me first.

01:53.251 --> 01:56.254
This is our first lead
in months.

01:56.288 --> 01:58.877
Bloody hell, Jo.

02:05.953 --> 02:08.921
We're good to go, boss?

02:08.956 --> 02:11.924
Sorry, Chris, the Super's
not buying the intel.

02:11.959 --> 02:14.927
-What?
-He needs more time.

02:14.962 --> 02:16.757
God sake.

02:19.242 --> 02:21.865
Stand down guys,
it's not happening.

02:21.900 --> 02:23.626
Super's pulling the plug.

02:23.660 --> 02:26.215
Says he wants more work
upon the intel.

02:32.945 --> 02:35.293
-Morning.
Morning, boss.

02:39.055 --> 02:40.850
And don't think
I didn't notice DI Fleming

02:40.884 --> 02:44.371
skulking in last minute
like the dirty stopout.

02:44.405 --> 02:45.682
Don't go there, boss.

02:45.717 --> 02:47.615
Glass houses.

02:47.650 --> 02:48.996
All right.

02:49.030 --> 02:52.275
Operation Lighthouse re
the unsolved murder

02:52.310 --> 02:56.279
of Gail Vella
on September 10th, 2019.

02:56.314 --> 02:58.385
Apologies to those of you
who were gearing up

02:58.419 --> 02:59.765
for the op last night.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.285
Following the Super's conflab
with the SFC,

03:02.320 --> 03:03.700
it was decided to await

03:03.735 --> 03:05.633
Executive Level sign-off.

03:08.049 --> 03:11.915
The name we've been given
is Ross Turner.

03:11.950 --> 03:16.265
Yesterday evening Turner
allegedly boasted to a CHIS

03:16.299 --> 03:18.474
he'd been involved
in Gail's murder.

03:18.508 --> 03:20.924
Turner's name is negative
on the PNC

03:20.959 --> 03:22.409
and the National Database

03:22.443 --> 03:25.343
plus local intel checks
are drawing blanks.

03:25.377 --> 03:27.621
Hence, we're treating
"Ross Turner"

03:27.655 --> 03:30.071
as most likely an alias.

03:30.106 --> 03:31.694
We've been given an address,

03:31.728 --> 03:34.490
-Flat 4
-F, Beechwood House.

03:34.524 --> 03:37.665
<i>In-situ</i> surveillance
was established last night.

03:37.700 --> 03:40.358
The team captured this image.

03:41.911 --> 03:45.570
Enhanced here.

03:45.604 --> 03:48.607
Turner is likely to be armed
and is considered

03:48.642 --> 03:50.678
extremely dangerous.

06:03.673 --> 06:06.400
You know a getaway vehicle
when you see one, Kate.

06:06.435 --> 06:07.919
Bookies right there.

06:07.953 --> 06:11.163

to help run her husband's
haulage business.

08:48.286 --> 08:50.391
I suppose we'd better start
by asking OCC Health

08:50.426 --> 08:51.876

DP for custody transfer.</i>

14:03.532 --> 14:05.568
<i>Bringing suspect out now.</i>

14:05.603 --> 14:08.675
<i>Control, Five,
Three, received.</i>

14:24.001 --> 14:25.381
Thanks for stepping in.

14:25.416 --> 14:27.314
Totally fantastic work.

14:27.349 --> 14:29.109
Happy to help, ma'am.

14:56.654 --> 14:59.001
IDENT 1 was a negative
on his prints.

14:59.036 --> 15:01.176
At first, he was reluctant
to give a name,

15:01.210 --> 15:03.972
and then he did confirm
Ross Turner.

15:04.006 --> 15:06.043
Sorry, Chris.
Did he volunteer the name

15:06.077 --> 15:07.492
or was he asked
a leading question

15:07.527 --> 15:10.116
-if Ross Turner was his name?
-Good point, Kate.

15:10.150 --> 15:12.670
The name was put to him first.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.534
The ID from the CHIS...
The ID from the CHIS...

15:14.568 --> 15:16.570
Sorry, boss, great minds.

15:16.605 --> 15:19.366
So, the CHIS who gave us
Turner's name and address?

15:19.401 --> 15:20.643
We need to get him in

15:20.678 --> 15:22.576
to confirm or deny ID
on the Suspect.

15:22.611 --> 15:24.095
I've been on it
all day, ma'am.

15:24.130 --> 15:25.510
Handler's lost contact.

15:25.545 --> 15:27.167
He reckons the CHIS
has bottled it.

15:27.202 --> 15:29.307
Christ sake.

15:29.342 --> 15:31.413
Sorry, Chris,
maybe have one more go please?

15:31.447 --> 15:32.724
Boss.

15:37.695 --> 15:40.525
Clearly Turner's
not what we expected,

15:40.560 --> 15:42.458
if that's even his name.

15:42.493 --> 15:44.978
Custody's asked the HCP
to carry out

15:45.013 --> 15:47.394
an initial mental state
examination to make sure

15:47.429 --> 15:49.707
he's got the capacity
to face an interview.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.329
Not just an interview.

15:51.364 --> 15:53.400
A person with learning
difficulties is more likely

15:53.435 --> 15:55.540
to be the victim of crime
than the perpetrator.

15:55.575 --> 15:57.163
You wonder
if he's got the capacity

15:57.197 --> 15:59.268
to carry out a murder
in the first place.

15:59.303 --> 16:01.512
There's always been
two theories.

16:01.546 --> 16:03.169
a hit.

16:03.203 --> 16:06.551
I agree, Kate,
he's not our man.

16:06.586 --> 16:10.245
a stalker slash
obsessed fan.

16:10.279 --> 16:12.454
That's by far
the more credible theory.

16:14.421 --> 16:16.527
All right.
I'll get right back to you.

16:19.426 --> 16:21.118
Sarge, Front Desk called up.

16:21.152 --> 16:22.533
There's an officer
asking for you.

16:22.567 --> 16:24.638
Won't say what about.
Won't even give a name.

16:24.673 --> 16:26.192
It's late.

16:29.160 --> 16:31.197
Fine, I'll deal with it
on my way out.

16:40.344 --> 16:41.586
Steve Arnott.

16:41.621 --> 16:43.036
Farida?

16:43.071 --> 16:44.658
I'd rather not give my name.

16:44.693 --> 16:46.695
I can appreciate why
that might be but, sorry,

16:46.729 --> 16:48.110
if you're still
at Polk Avenue,

16:48.145 --> 16:49.387
AC-3 have jurisdiction now.

16:49.422 --> 16:51.320
And you should contact them.

16:52.701 --> 16:54.220
I'm on the Hill.

16:55.773 --> 16:57.740
Murder Investigation Team.

17:04.506 --> 17:06.059
Wait there.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.386
Can I get you a tea
or coffee or anything?

17:22.420 --> 17:23.904
No thanks.

17:40.128 --> 17:41.543
The rate of unsolved crimes

17:41.577 --> 17:43.476
is proving to be a nightmare.

17:43.510 --> 17:45.823
But it helps the public
to realise that we don't have

17:45.857 --> 17:47.687
the resources
to investigate burglaries.

17:47.721 --> 17:49.620
With any luck they'll stop
reporting them,

17:49.654 --> 17:51.242
the figures will look better.

17:52.243 --> 17:55.177
-Ted.
-Ma'am.

17:55.212 --> 17:57.248
Apologies, ma'am.
I just saw you booked

17:57.283 --> 17:58.836
the conference room there.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.389
My office must have cocked up.

18:00.424 --> 18:01.770
I never got the invitation.

18:01.804 --> 18:03.668
No cock-up.

18:03.703 --> 18:05.843
Sorry, Ted, you're not
on the list this time.

18:07.638 --> 18:10.848
I accepted the disciplinary
action, ma'am.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.126
This matter is now closed.

18:13.161 --> 18:16.509
You lead
an anticorruption unit.

18:16.543 --> 18:17.889
There's plenty think
you're lucky

18:17.924 --> 18:19.926
not to have been removed.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.824
Best keep your head down, Ted.

18:40.222 --> 18:41.465
Got a few minutes, gaffer?

18:41.499 --> 18:43.846
Be my guest, son.
Be my guest.

18:46.746 --> 18:49.266
Last night I took a statement
from Officer J.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.337
Who was working
at Polk Avenue in 2017

18:51.371 --> 18:52.786
when we investigated
DCI Roz Huntley.

18:52.821 --> 18:54.512
Mmm-hmm.

18:54.547 --> 18:56.687
Officer J. expressed concerns
regarding the professional

18:56.721 --> 18:58.620
conduct of DCI
Joanne Davidson,

18:58.654 --> 19:01.001
an SIO on the Murder
Investigation Team

19:01.036 --> 19:03.418
based at Hillside Lane.

19:03.452 --> 19:05.627
Hillside Lane, yeah,
everybody's talking

19:05.661 --> 19:07.594
about this breakthrough
they've made a suspect

19:07.629 --> 19:09.700
-in custody for Vella.
Yes, sir.

19:09.734 --> 19:12.220
DCI Davidson was posted
to the Hill a year ago,

19:12.254 --> 19:14.222
one month after
Gail Vella's murder.

19:14.256 --> 19:15.671
And She took over
from the original SIO

19:15.706 --> 19:17.294
leading the inquiry.

19:17.328 --> 19:20.814
As you know, sir,
Gail Vella drove home late

19:20.849 --> 19:22.264
on the evening
of September 10th

19:22.299 --> 19:24.197
in a dark grey Peugeot 108

19:24.232 --> 19:26.234
which she parked outside
her house in Kingsgate

19:26.268 --> 19:28.822
and was shot dead as she
got out of the vehicle.

19:28.857 --> 19:31.618
At postmortem,
the pathologist concluded

19:31.653 --> 19:33.379
the muzzle of the firearm
had been pressed

19:33.413 --> 19:35.864
against the back of the skull
at the moment of discharge.

19:35.898 --> 19:37.762
Hard-contact technique
to minimise

19:37.797 --> 19:40.455
the spread of sound,
powder and blood.

19:40.489 --> 19:42.422
According to Officer J,
the suspect appears to lack

19:42.457 --> 19:43.872
the capacity
to carry out a murder

19:43.906 --> 19:46.219
that's still unsolved
after over a year.

19:46.254 --> 19:47.772
She also alleges
DCI Davidson

19:47.807 --> 19:49.740
unnecessarily diverted
and delayed the operation

19:49.774 --> 19:51.362
to arrest the suspect.

19:51.397 --> 19:54.054
And any previous criticisms
of Davidson on record?

19:54.089 --> 19:55.918
None I've found so far, sir.

20:00.509 --> 20:03.754
I'd like to covertly approach
current members of her team.

20:08.931 --> 20:10.588
Wee Chloe, she's seems to be

20:10.623 --> 20:12.625
getting on really well
out there, doesn't she,

20:12.659 --> 20:14.420
what do you say son?

20:14.454 --> 20:16.318
She's good, sir.

20:21.634 --> 20:23.014
We really can't be sure

20:23.049 --> 20:24.844
about the loyalty
of some of these people.

20:24.878 --> 20:26.432
They could banjax
the whole thing.

20:26.466 --> 20:28.537
Sir, regardless
of the personnel involved,

20:28.572 --> 20:30.436
Vella's still
the highest-profile inquiry

20:30.470 --> 20:31.816
engaging this force.

20:31.851 --> 20:33.991
And Officer J.
didn't go to AC-3 or AC-9.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.648
She came to AC-12
because she believes

20:35.682 --> 20:38.375
we'll do right by her.

20:38.409 --> 20:40.963
She backed the right horse
there, didn't she son.

20:40.998 --> 20:42.482
But I'm gonna need
a hell of a lot more

20:42.517 --> 20:44.657
before I can authorise
a formal inquiry.

20:44.691 --> 20:46.969
-Sir...
-Houl yer whisht.

20:47.004 --> 20:49.558
I need more.

20:49.593 --> 20:50.870
Sir.

21:12.823 --> 21:14.376
All right?
-Yeah.

21:14.411 --> 21:15.791
-It's great to see you.
-You too.

21:15.826 --> 21:17.068
I got you one.
Hope that's okay.

21:17.103 --> 21:18.484
I'm on the clock.

21:18.518 --> 21:20.106
No, great,
I appreciate you

21:20.140 --> 21:21.763
making the time.

21:21.797 --> 21:23.558
I should be calling you
"ma'am".

21:23.592 --> 21:26.526
Strictly speaking
but I'll let you off.

21:26.561 --> 21:29.529
So, how can I help you, Steve?

21:29.564 --> 21:31.013
Strictly off the record,

21:31.048 --> 21:33.119
I've reached the end
of the line in anticorruption.

21:33.153 --> 21:34.638
About time.

21:34.672 --> 21:36.502
It's no disrespect
to the Gaffer,

21:36.536 --> 21:39.436
I've stuck it out,
I'm bored, mate.

21:39.470 --> 21:40.747
I'm ready
for a new challenge.

21:40.782 --> 21:44.095
Well, we can always
use good people.

21:44.130 --> 21:46.684
Cheers, I appreciate it.

21:48.134 --> 21:50.930
Sorry, I should get back.

21:52.207 --> 21:54.796
But maybe
do a drink one night?

21:55.935 --> 21:58.662
-Um...
-Luke and I have split up.

21:58.696 --> 22:00.457
No. it's just...

22:00.491 --> 22:02.044
If we're gonna be
working together.

22:03.425 --> 22:04.668
You really have been working

22:04.702 --> 22:07.636
Anticorruption too long
ain't you.

22:08.879 --> 22:10.708
Good to see you.

22:27.207 --> 22:29.520
DI Fleming, MIT.

22:32.178 --> 22:33.938
Thanks ma'am.

22:35.940 --> 22:37.735
...number of Newspaper
and Magazine clippings

22:37.770 --> 22:40.428
containing images
of Gail Vella.

22:40.462 --> 22:42.153
Morning, Kate.
Boss.

22:42.188 --> 22:43.810
-All right, Chris.
All right, ma'am.

22:43.845 --> 22:45.640
I was just saying
there's a number of newspaper

22:45.674 --> 22:47.573
and magazine cuttings

22:47.607 --> 22:50.541
containing images
of Gail Vella.

22:50.576 --> 22:51.922
Significant.

22:51.956 --> 22:54.580
Abundant fingerprints
and DNA deposits.

22:54.614 --> 22:55.857
And the prints
appear to relate

22:55.891 --> 22:57.652
to two individuals only.

22:57.686 --> 23:00.586
One of who is the suspect
we've got in custody.

23:00.620 --> 23:01.932
Okay.

23:01.966 --> 23:05.245
The search team detected signs
of forced entry.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.524
Our AFOs smashed
the front door in.

23:07.558 --> 23:10.009
The damage is
on the inside of the door.

23:10.043 --> 23:12.805
The markings match the damage
to the back of this chair.

23:12.839 --> 23:14.531
Any estimate
on when this alleged

23:14.565 --> 23:17.430
-forced entry happened?
-No.

23:17.465 --> 23:19.087
It's Farida.
Okay if I take this?

23:19.121 --> 23:20.606
Sure.

23:23.540 --> 23:24.851
Hey, Farida...

23:24.886 --> 23:26.508
Possibly the chair
was jammed up

23:26.543 --> 23:28.165
against the front door to
prevent someone breaking in.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.580
Like Chris said,

23:29.615 --> 23:31.168
that could have happened
anytime.

23:31.202 --> 23:32.963
Well, the place
is well maintained.

23:32.997 --> 23:34.240
It's unlikely the damage
would have gone

23:34.274 --> 23:35.655
unrepaired for long.

23:35.690 --> 23:38.209
Unlikely but not impossible.

23:38.244 --> 23:39.659
Good news.

23:39.694 --> 23:42.075
HCP has okayed the suspect
for interview.

23:42.110 --> 23:43.836
Great.

23:57.574 --> 23:59.265
Have a seat.

24:04.719 --> 24:06.134
We'll be with you
the whole time

24:06.168 --> 24:07.860
and if you get confused
by anything

24:07.894 --> 24:09.482
it's okay to tell us.

24:33.368 --> 24:35.301
That's just
the tape recorder starting,

24:35.335 --> 24:38.028
it won't last long.

24:38.062 --> 24:40.996
Murder Investigation Team
interview of Suspect A

24:41.031 --> 24:43.551
by Detective Chief
Inspector Davidson

24:43.585 --> 24:45.345
and Detective Sergeant Lomax

24:45.380 --> 24:47.071
in the presence
of the Suspect's Solicitor

24:47.106 --> 24:48.935
and Appropriate Adult.

24:48.970 --> 24:51.006
You do not have
to say anything.

24:51.041 --> 24:52.974
It may harm your defence
if you do not mention

24:53.008 --> 24:55.804
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

24:55.839 --> 24:58.151
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

24:58.186 --> 24:59.774
Do you understand?

24:59.808 --> 25:01.223
Yes.

25:01.258 --> 25:03.053
What's your name?

25:04.951 --> 25:06.643
If I may?

25:06.677 --> 25:08.161
My client's informed me
that under the strain

25:08.196 --> 25:10.992
of initial questioning
he gave the name Ross Turner.

25:11.026 --> 25:12.959
His name is not Ross Turner.

25:12.994 --> 25:14.374
His name is Terry Boyle.

25:14.409 --> 25:17.619
Is that your name,
then, Terry Boyle?

25:20.967 --> 25:24.177
For the DIR,
the Suspect is nodding.

25:24.212 --> 25:27.042
Why did you say your name
was Ross Turner?

25:27.077 --> 25:28.596
My client's been clear.

25:28.630 --> 25:29.873
His name is not Ross Turner.

25:29.907 --> 25:31.322
His name is Terry Boyle.

25:31.357 --> 25:34.153
Okay. We'll look into that.

25:34.187 --> 25:36.327
Moving on.

25:36.362 --> 25:38.985
The property
where you were arrested,

25:39.020 --> 25:42.057
-Flat 4
-F, Beechwood House.

25:42.092 --> 25:43.576
Is that where you live?

25:45.647 --> 25:48.374
Do you live in the property
or were you just visiting?

25:50.928 --> 25:53.655
-No.
No, you don't live there

25:53.690 --> 25:55.692
or no you weren't visiting?

25:56.934 --> 25:59.178
Mr Boyle has provided me
with his address.

25:59.212 --> 26:00.869
He does not reside
at Beechwood House.

26:00.904 --> 26:03.665
He resides
in the Kingsgate area,

26:03.700 --> 26:05.633
Flat B, Dorton Villas.

26:05.667 --> 26:09.153
<i>Okay, we'll look
into that as well.</i>

26:09.188 --> 26:11.811
<i>Interestingly,
the Kingsgate area</i>

26:11.846 --> 26:15.850
is where a journalist called
Gail Vella lived.

26:15.884 --> 26:17.921
Do you know
who I'm talking about?

26:20.751 --> 26:22.304
Suspect nodded.

26:22.339 --> 26:24.134
Thank you.

26:26.654 --> 26:28.725
For the DIR,
I'm showing the suspect

26:28.759 --> 26:31.451
item reference RCG-6.

26:31.486 --> 26:33.281
RCG-6 is a press cutting

26:33.315 --> 26:35.801
featuring an image
of Gail Vella.

26:35.835 --> 26:40.115
I'm also showing the suspect
item reference RCG-7,

26:40.150 --> 26:42.048
another press cutting
featuring an image

26:42.083 --> 26:45.707
of Gail Vella,
and item reference RCG-8,

26:45.742 --> 26:47.122
also a press cutting

26:47.157 --> 26:49.193
featuring an image
of Gail Vella.

26:49.228 --> 26:52.162
Do you recognise
these press cuttings?

27:00.515 --> 27:04.312
For the DIR, the suspect
is not responding.

27:04.346 --> 27:07.004
Do you recognise this woman?

27:08.316 --> 27:12.216
For the DIR,
the suspect is nodding.

27:12.251 --> 27:14.840
What's your relationship
to this woman?

27:14.874 --> 27:16.738
Nice lady.

27:20.846 --> 27:23.780
<i>Suspect answered,
nice lady.</i>

27:31.891 --> 27:33.962
MIT have put the IDs
of the Armed Robbers

27:33.997 --> 27:36.344
up on the database.

27:36.378 --> 27:38.277
Have a look at this.

27:55.156 --> 27:57.365
-This it?
-Exactly.

27:57.399 --> 27:58.884
Between them these guys
have never robbed

27:58.918 --> 28:00.506
anything bigger
than their local Greggs.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.197
And they just happen
to be on the exact route

28:02.232 --> 28:03.854
and time of an op
to bring in a suspect

28:03.889 --> 28:05.822
in an unsolved murder.

28:05.856 --> 28:07.824
Based on
Officer J.'s statement,

28:07.858 --> 28:09.929
the MIT convoy
was travelling up hill,

28:09.964 --> 28:12.449
past this parade of shops.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.002
Well, where's the bookies?

28:14.037 --> 28:16.039
It's around the corner.

28:21.458 --> 28:23.978
It's already
a narrow line of sight.

28:24.012 --> 28:27.326
You add in Davidson's convoy
travelling at high speed.

28:29.397 --> 28:31.157
I'll call in for the footage
off the security camera.

28:31.192 --> 28:33.263
You go and check out
the camera in the bookies.

28:33.297 --> 28:35.265
Sarge.

28:58.322 --> 29:01.118
DI Fleming, MIT,
visiting Terry Boyle's flat.

29:01.153 --> 29:03.086
Ma'am.
Thanks.

29:22.277 --> 29:25.142
Hi, any updates.

29:25.177 --> 29:27.489
So far, apart
from the pics on the walls,

29:27.524 --> 29:29.284
we're not finding much
evidence of this

29:29.319 --> 29:31.148
being anyone's
permanent residence

29:31.183 --> 29:33.530
let alone the suspect's.

29:34.531 --> 29:36.809
The place is clean.

29:36.844 --> 29:38.431
Extremely clean.

29:38.466 --> 29:40.295
Ta.

29:59.487 --> 30:01.006
So, the suspect's
alleged address

30:01.040 --> 30:03.422
contained even more
Gail Vella images.

30:03.456 --> 30:06.977
And neighbours positively
ID'd his picture.

30:07.012 --> 30:08.634
Meanwhile we've interviewed
a number of residents

30:08.668 --> 30:10.084
at Beechwood House.

30:10.118 --> 30:12.845
Whoever lived in Flat F
kept himself to himself.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.260
And the few
that did notice a resident

30:14.295 --> 30:17.574
describe him
as dark-haired and stocky.

30:17.608 --> 30:19.887
Like Terry Boyle.

30:19.921 --> 30:21.681
What we really need
is the CHIS to confirm

30:21.716 --> 30:23.891
whether Terry Boyle
was the man that confessed

30:23.925 --> 30:25.616
to an involvement
in Gail Vella's murder,

30:25.651 --> 30:28.033
or it was someone else
entirely.

30:28.067 --> 30:29.413
Tell me about it.

30:29.448 --> 30:31.933
My patience is all used up.

30:31.968 --> 30:34.108
Set up an urgent meet
with the CHIS's Handler.

30:34.142 --> 30:35.488
Cheers, Boss.

30:45.050 --> 30:47.052
Boss,
this is the CHIS's Handler.

30:47.086 --> 30:48.950
I've brought him up
to speed on our inquiry.

30:48.985 --> 30:50.227
DS Marks.

30:50.262 --> 30:52.195
DCI Davidson.

30:52.229 --> 30:54.507
You'll have heard from Kate
how important it is for us

30:54.542 --> 30:57.234
to acquire your CHIS's intel.

30:57.269 --> 30:59.305
I'm doing everything I can.

30:59.340 --> 31:01.583
I don't know
what more you expect.

31:01.618 --> 31:04.034
For a start you could help us
locate your CHIS.

31:04.069 --> 31:05.380
I've been trying
to make contact with him.

31:05.415 --> 31:06.968
He's gone to ground.

31:07.003 --> 31:08.280
Then no disrespect, mate,

31:08.314 --> 31:11.524
but we've got the resources
to find him.

31:11.559 --> 31:14.527
You're asking me to disclose
his identity?

31:14.562 --> 31:16.322
You know I can't do that.

31:16.357 --> 31:18.877
Is the word "ma'am"
in your vocabulary?

31:20.085 --> 31:21.672
To locate your CHIS
and convey him

31:21.707 --> 31:23.157
to a place of safety
from which

31:23.191 --> 31:24.434
he can assist our inquiry,

31:24.468 --> 31:27.540
we need you to disclose
his identity.

31:27.575 --> 31:29.301
No.

31:29.335 --> 31:30.612
Ma'am.

31:38.275 --> 31:39.725
Are you worried about him?

31:39.759 --> 31:42.107
Yes. Of course, I am!

31:44.178 --> 31:46.111
I'm sorry Sarge.

32:03.991 --> 32:06.062
<i>You've reached
PS Farida Jatri.</i>

32:06.096 --> 32:08.064
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

32:08.098 --> 32:09.789
Farida, it's Steve Arnott.

32:09.824 --> 32:11.377
Look, we're progressing
the inquiry,

32:11.412 --> 32:14.104
but I need your help
to fill in some of the gaps.

32:14.139 --> 32:16.520
Call me when you can, okay?

32:16.555 --> 32:18.246
Thank you.

32:46.585 --> 32:48.483
MIT, DI Fleming.

32:49.726 --> 32:51.555
Thanks for calling me
back Sarge.

32:53.212 --> 32:54.800
How do you spell that?

32:54.834 --> 32:56.733
Jo.

33:00.219 --> 33:01.807
Sir.

33:01.841 --> 33:03.429
The Chief Constable's been on.

33:03.464 --> 33:05.776
I said I'll call back
with an update.

33:05.811 --> 33:07.640
Too early to say, sir.

33:07.675 --> 33:10.091
I should have been back home
ages ago, my feet up.

33:10.126 --> 33:11.817
Have you got our man or not?

33:11.851 --> 33:15.062
Like I said, sir,
too early to say.

33:15.096 --> 33:16.787
We'll need another
twelve hours with him.

33:16.822 --> 33:19.135
Ah for God's sake.

33:19.169 --> 33:21.482
We've hit a bit
of a brick wall, sir.

33:21.516 --> 33:24.830
The CHIS,
he's dropped off the radar.

33:36.807 --> 33:39.051
If this is going to go
the way we want,

33:39.086 --> 33:41.053
we need to find out who he is.

33:46.610 --> 33:48.198
We've got a job to do.

33:48.233 --> 33:50.166
The Handler's
within his rights not to.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.443
Fuck the Handler.

33:51.477 --> 33:53.100
And fuck the CHIS.

33:57.138 --> 34:00.279
Okay. Any chance you
could scan over the paperwork?

34:03.834 --> 34:06.630
Suspect's been bedded down
for a rest period.

34:06.665 --> 34:07.907
Not much more
happening tonight.

34:07.942 --> 34:09.323
I might leave soon.

34:09.357 --> 34:11.325
I was thinking the same.

34:11.359 --> 34:13.120
No worries
you've been a big help.

34:13.154 --> 34:15.363
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

34:17.917 --> 34:19.298
Sorry, boss.

34:19.333 --> 34:20.817
What's up?

34:25.753 --> 34:27.617
I've taken reports
from the Surveillance Teams

34:27.651 --> 34:29.239
<i>in situ</i> at Beechwood House

34:29.274 --> 34:31.241
where Terry Boyle
was arrested.

34:31.276 --> 34:33.278
When we were diverted
to the Armed Robbery,

34:33.312 --> 34:34.762
there was some confusion

34:34.796 --> 34:36.522
over the Surveillance
Authority.

34:36.557 --> 34:38.490
What confusion?

34:39.629 --> 34:41.217
Well, the team
was only in place

34:41.251 --> 34:43.667
under Directed Authority,
and it got queried

34:43.702 --> 34:45.911
as requiring Intrusive
Authority

34:45.945 --> 34:48.293
because they were using
extreme high-power lenses

34:48.327 --> 34:50.260
to view inside the property.

34:50.295 --> 34:51.917
Shit.

34:51.951 --> 34:55.438
Yeah. Which means they had to
pull out until it was sorted.

34:57.233 --> 35:00.926
Looks like the Super
messed up the paperwork.

35:00.960 --> 35:04.481
How long was Beechwood House
not under surveillance?

35:04.516 --> 35:06.311
Three and a half hours.

35:08.658 --> 35:10.798
Which means...

35:10.832 --> 35:13.939
we don't know if Terry Boyle
is this person

35:13.973 --> 35:16.286
or this person was able
to flee the property

35:16.321 --> 35:19.393
during the absence
of surveillance.

35:19.427 --> 35:21.291
I see.

35:21.326 --> 35:25.433
We'll have to factor that
into our thinking.

35:25.468 --> 35:28.747
I haven't shared this
with anyone else, boss.

35:28.781 --> 35:30.783
Thanks, Kate.

35:30.818 --> 35:32.440
Someone comes
from Anticorruption

35:32.475 --> 35:34.753
you worry they're not
going to be a team player.

35:34.787 --> 35:36.720
I got fed up
of nicking coppers.

35:36.755 --> 35:40.276
I'd rather go after the psycho
that murdered Gail.

35:40.310 --> 35:41.932
Cheers, boss.

36:05.370 --> 36:07.268
What have we got?

36:08.545 --> 36:10.547
Based on the claims
made by Officer J.

36:10.582 --> 36:11.893
DCI Davidson
ordered the convoy

36:11.928 --> 36:13.343
to attend the armed robbery
on the grounds

36:13.378 --> 36:15.276
there was an urgent threat
to the public.

36:15.311 --> 36:16.622
Fair enough.

36:16.657 --> 36:18.003
This is the Getaway Van
that triggered

36:18.037 --> 36:19.901
DCI Davidson's suspicions.

36:21.972 --> 36:25.528
And these are the MIT vehicles
passing through at high speed.

36:25.562 --> 36:27.944
This, according to Officer J.,

36:27.978 --> 36:30.222
is the moment Davidson
made her decision.

36:31.568 --> 36:33.432
But that convoy
was going like the clappers.

36:33.467 --> 36:35.296
You'd do well to spot
a pipe band in there.

36:35.331 --> 36:39.335
I agree, sir, that's why
we need more evidence.

36:39.369 --> 36:42.510
But you have an informant
on the team, right.

36:42.545 --> 36:43.960
She's not responded
to any of my efforts

36:43.994 --> 36:46.065
to make further contact.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.067
Gonna need more, son.

36:48.102 --> 36:50.932
Kate's Davidson's Deputy SIO.

36:50.967 --> 36:53.659
If anyone's got
the inside track, it's her.

36:53.694 --> 36:55.282
I am aware.

36:55.316 --> 36:57.387
No one's better qualified
or better positioned

36:57.422 --> 37:01.080
to act as a CHIS
or even a UCO.

37:01.115 --> 37:02.910
I'll give it some thought.

37:02.944 --> 37:05.430
Carry on.

37:05.464 --> 37:07.432
Sir.

38:38.730 --> 38:42.147
Boss. Ma'am.

38:42.181 --> 38:45.357
Pathologist says
he died instantly.

38:45.392 --> 38:47.670
The pattern of injuries
implies a fall from height.

38:51.087 --> 38:53.883
Okay, have we confirmed
ID yet?

38:53.917 --> 38:57.162
I took the liberty of sending
a photo to the Handler.

38:58.508 --> 39:00.510
He confirms it's the CHIS.

39:03.996 --> 39:05.722
Shit.

39:18.494 --> 39:20.012
Sorry, boss.

39:20.047 --> 39:21.911
Got the file on the CHIS.

39:21.945 --> 39:24.154
Low-level offender
named Alastair Oldroyd.

39:24.189 --> 39:26.191
Unfortunately,
there's nothing on CCTV

39:26.225 --> 39:28.987
so whatever happened to him,
happened in a blind spot.

39:29.021 --> 39:31.886
Door-to-door haven't found
any witnesses to the fall.

39:32.887 --> 39:34.406
Right.

39:34.441 --> 39:37.478
A number of people
do report hearing a scream.

39:37.513 --> 39:40.964
Suggests he was pushed,
but not conclusively.

39:40.999 --> 39:43.173
Either way,
we've lost the only person

39:43.208 --> 39:45.452
that can say for certain
if Terry Boyle claimed

39:45.486 --> 39:47.177
to have been involved
in Gail's murder

39:47.212 --> 39:48.800
or it was someone else.

39:48.834 --> 39:50.526
Yep.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.907
If only we'd have been
given his ID,

39:52.942 --> 39:54.633
we might have been able
to have saved him.

39:54.668 --> 39:58.188
Exactly.

39:58.223 --> 39:59.811
Cheers boss.

40:22.661 --> 40:24.663
Steve Arnott.

40:26.803 --> 40:29.703
Farida, are you okay?

40:29.737 --> 40:31.843
What's happened?

40:31.877 --> 40:34.466
Our most important witness
was just found dead.

40:34.501 --> 40:36.675
What witness?

40:36.710 --> 40:38.228
This is too dangerous.

40:38.263 --> 40:40.161
Wait,

40:40.196 --> 40:42.543
you're not suggesting
Davidson was involved?

40:42.578 --> 40:45.132
You have no idea
what she's capable of,

40:45.166 --> 40:46.651
none at all.

40:48.135 --> 40:50.758
Don't call me again.

41:01.666 --> 41:04.116
Second MIT interview
of Terry Boyle

41:04.151 --> 41:07.223
by DCI Davidson
and DS Lomax.

41:07.257 --> 41:10.744
Mr Boyle,
you remain under caution.

41:10.778 --> 41:12.331
Please refer to Document 36

41:12.366 --> 41:13.885
submitted in Disclosure.

41:13.919 --> 41:17.578
Document 36 is a report
regarding fingerprints

41:17.613 --> 41:20.339
-detected at Flat 4
-F
Beechwood House

41:20.374 --> 41:23.204
during a lawful search
on 27th October.

41:23.239 --> 41:25.206
A number of said prints
match the fingerprints

41:25.241 --> 41:28.347
obtained from Mr Boyle
following his arrest.

41:28.382 --> 41:30.833
A significant number
of other fingerprints

41:30.867 --> 41:32.524
match an individual identified

41:32.559 --> 41:34.284
by the Police
National Computer

41:34.319 --> 41:36.563
as Carl Banks.

41:38.944 --> 41:40.187
<i>Terry, what
is your relationship</i>

41:40.221 --> 41:41.671
<i>with Carl Banks?</i>

41:43.673 --> 41:45.641
<i>Do you know Carl Banks?</i>

41:46.676 --> 41:48.678
No comment.

41:51.716 --> 41:53.614
You sure that's how
you want to answer?

41:54.926 --> 41:58.136
Can you tell us
who is Carl Banks?

41:58.170 --> 41:59.965
<i>I suggest you arrest Mr Banks</i>

42:00.000 --> 42:02.899
and put that question to him
rather than to my client.

42:02.934 --> 42:06.178
So far we've been unable
to trace Carl Banks.

42:06.213 --> 42:08.042
Perhaps your client
will provide information

42:08.077 --> 42:10.113
that will help us locate him.

42:12.288 --> 42:15.325

42:15.360 --> 42:18.846
Document 42 submitted
in Disclosure.

42:18.881 --> 42:20.986
For the DIR, Document 42

42:21.021 --> 42:23.264
is a report
on chemical traces detected

42:23.299 --> 42:26.889
in Flat B Dorton Villas
on 28th of October.

42:26.923 --> 42:30.651
Said traces have been
identified as cleaning fluids.

42:32.170 --> 42:34.966
Did you carry out a thorough
cleaning of the premises

42:35.000 --> 42:37.106
in order to destroy
forensic evidence?

42:43.112 --> 42:46.184
For the DIR,
the suspect is not responding.

42:54.433 --> 42:57.851
of Flat B Dorton Villas
on 28th of October

42:57.885 --> 42:59.887
showing the kitchen area.

42:59.922 --> 43:02.131
Markings on the floor
suggest a large appliance

43:02.165 --> 43:04.202
had been present
for some time.

43:04.236 --> 43:07.688
Please cross-reference

43:07.723 --> 43:09.000
chemical traces detected

43:09.034 --> 43:11.416
resembling refrigerator
coolant.

43:11.450 --> 43:14.108
Our assumption is the removal

43:14.143 --> 43:17.111
of a refrigerator or freezer.

43:17.146 --> 43:19.907
What happened
to this appliance?

43:21.909 --> 43:23.255
I don't know.

43:26.707 --> 43:28.916
<i>Document 42 again.</i>

43:28.951 --> 43:31.091
<i>Further chemical traces
were detected</i>

43:31.125 --> 43:33.783
<i>which have been identified
as two substances</i>

43:33.818 --> 43:36.993
<i>listed under the Misuse</i>

43:37.028 --> 43:39.237
<i>cocaine and diamorphine.</i>

43:39.271 --> 43:42.067
<i>Diamorphine is
commonly known as "heroin".</i>

43:42.102 --> 43:45.450
Have you ever used
these substances?

43:52.146 --> 43:54.424
Do you have an explanation
for why these substances

43:54.459 --> 43:57.807
were detected in your flat?

43:57.842 --> 43:59.740
No comment.

43:59.775 --> 44:01.466
These are powerful substances.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.502
Even in small quantities,

44:03.537 --> 44:06.229
they can affect mood
and memory.

44:06.264 --> 44:09.992
They can cause unpredictable,
violent behaviour.

44:13.236 --> 44:16.688
Images 20 to 22.

44:16.723 --> 44:20.519
Images 20 to 22
are photos of Gail Vella

44:20.554 --> 44:22.901
found in Flat B Dorton Villas

44:22.936 --> 44:25.870
during a lawful search
on 28th of October.

44:25.904 --> 44:28.010
Document 44 submitted in...

44:28.044 --> 44:29.494
May I interject?

44:29.528 --> 44:31.151
You've presented evidence
of intense cleaning

44:31.185 --> 44:32.531
at my client's home.

44:32.566 --> 44:34.154
Why, then, would these
incriminating images

44:34.188 --> 44:36.259
have been left behind?

44:36.294 --> 44:40.160
Document 44 submitted
in Disclosure.

44:40.194 --> 44:43.784
Document 44 describes
deposits of semen

44:43.819 --> 44:46.718
detected on said images
of Gail Vella.

44:46.753 --> 44:48.927
Analysis of these deposits
of semen

44:48.962 --> 44:51.516
gives a 99.9% probability

44:51.550 --> 44:54.174
that they originated
from your client.

44:59.282 --> 45:03.252
Did you want to have sexual
relations with Gail Vella?

45:03.286 --> 45:05.737
<i>Did you want her
to be your girlfriend?</i>

45:07.601 --> 45:10.880
For the DIR,
the suspect is not responding.

45:10.915 --> 45:14.332
Did you become angry
or frustrated?

45:14.366 --> 45:17.197
Did it make you want
to hurt Gail?

45:17.231 --> 45:20.269
For the DIR,
the suspect is not responding.

45:23.237 --> 45:26.068
<i>I'm showing the suspect
an image of an article</i>

45:26.102 --> 45:29.278
<i>of clothing, BC-9, recovered</i>

45:29.312 --> 45:30.555
from Flat B Dorton Villas

45:30.589 --> 45:33.351
on 28th of October.

45:33.385 --> 45:37.010
Document 60 submitted
in Disclosure.

45:37.044 --> 45:39.081
Document 60 is a report

45:39.115 --> 45:41.428
of particles
of gunshot residue

45:41.462 --> 45:43.810
detected on BC-9.

45:45.052 --> 45:47.952
Mr Boyle,
did you shoot Gail Vella?

46:31.478 --> 46:33.100
What kind of nobby signal
was that?

46:33.135 --> 46:34.964
First thing that came
to mind.

46:34.999 --> 46:37.311
Go round the block,
in case anyone's watching.

46:37.346 --> 46:39.451
No worries.

46:45.043 --> 46:47.287
There's a nice little balti
up the road

46:47.321 --> 46:49.047
but I'm guessing that's not
why you're here though.

46:49.082 --> 46:51.981
I wish. Sorry, mate.

46:52.016 --> 46:53.327
Right.

46:53.362 --> 46:54.846
I can't share any details,

46:54.881 --> 46:56.399
but we might be looking
into Vella.

46:56.434 --> 46:59.126
Oh shit.

46:59.161 --> 47:01.059
Great, so when Buckells
and Davidson find out

47:01.094 --> 47:02.889
-they're gonna think...
They'll think either

47:02.923 --> 47:05.029
you're our CHIS or you've
been embedded as a UCO.

47:05.063 --> 47:07.169
That's why I'm giving you
a heads-up, Kate.

47:07.203 --> 47:09.240
Steve, you know what it's like
being ex-anticorruption.

47:09.274 --> 47:11.345
I've had to work my bollocks
off for them lot.

47:11.380 --> 47:13.002
Is this the Gaffer's way
of getting his own back?

47:13.037 --> 47:14.521
No, of course not.

47:14.555 --> 47:16.281
Why am I still
calling him Gaffer?

47:16.316 --> 47:18.111
He knows
why you moved on.

47:18.145 --> 47:19.595
Yeah, that's what worries me.

47:19.629 --> 47:22.943
AC-12 was tainted when
the Gaffer got investigated.

47:22.978 --> 47:24.324
Look, you've done your time,
made DI.

47:24.358 --> 47:25.877
You wanted to move on.

47:25.912 --> 47:27.396
He knows
it was nothing personal.

47:27.430 --> 47:29.294
Except you stayed.

47:33.609 --> 47:35.024
So what next?

47:35.059 --> 47:36.646
You opening
an official inquiry?

47:36.681 --> 47:38.303
We can keep it on the DL

47:38.338 --> 47:40.961
only if we've got a CHIS
inside MIT.

47:40.996 --> 47:43.032
Great. So either
I'm accused of being a traitor

47:43.067 --> 47:45.621
or I become one
to avoid being accused?

47:45.655 --> 47:47.588
Jesus Christ, Steve.

47:55.458 --> 47:57.495
I'm gonna have to think
about it.

47:57.529 --> 48:00.463
Cheers, Kate,
and that's all anyone can ask.

48:12.372 --> 48:13.994
The address
where Terry Boyle was arrested

48:14.029 --> 48:17.480
was covered in prints
matching Carl Banks.

48:34.083 --> 48:35.395
<i>One initial line
of inquiry in Vella</i>

48:35.429 --> 48:37.949
was a contract killing.

48:37.984 --> 48:39.571
According to my informant
on the Hill,

48:39.606 --> 48:41.504
Operation Lighthouse
has detected forensic evidence

48:41.539 --> 48:44.611
linking to this suspect,
Carl Banks.

48:44.645 --> 48:46.544
Carl Banks has an extensive
history of violence

48:46.578 --> 48:48.132
including firearms offences

48:48.166 --> 48:50.755
and a long association
with organised crime.

48:50.789 --> 48:52.377
It's much more likely
to be the gunman

48:52.412 --> 48:54.241
than the local oddball.
That's for sure.

48:54.276 --> 48:56.485
Yes, sir. It would appear
that if DCI Davidson

48:56.519 --> 48:58.038
deliberately delayed
the operation

48:58.073 --> 49:00.006
to arrest the suspect,
it's possible

49:00.040 --> 49:02.180
this was instrumental
in enabling Banks,

49:02.215 --> 49:03.802
the real killer, to flee.

49:03.837 --> 49:06.253
If we want to get to the
truth, there's no choice, sir,

49:06.288 --> 49:08.635
we've got to start formally
investigating Davidson.

49:08.669 --> 49:11.465
Well, that's what we do, son.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.295
We hunt the truth.

49:14.710 --> 49:16.574
Inquiry authorised.

49:18.334 --> 49:19.680
Thank you, sir.

49:22.166 --> 49:24.685
What are you waiting on,
a puff of white smoke?

49:24.720 --> 49:26.342
Sir.

50:19.395 --> 50:21.535
I thought we agreed
you'd be out?

50:21.570 --> 50:23.365
You don't even want to talk
about it?

50:23.399 --> 50:25.470
We've talked enough.

50:25.505 --> 50:28.646
I just want to get the last
of my things.

50:28.680 --> 50:30.855
I don't want a row, Farida.

50:30.889 --> 50:32.822
It's over.

50:44.558 --> 50:46.629
Farida. Please.

50:47.803 --> 50:49.598
You moving in with her now?

50:49.632 --> 50:50.875
"Her"?

50:50.909 --> 50:53.429
Smart money's on Kate Fleming.

50:53.464 --> 50:56.432
Kate and I have been shagging
on the sly for months

50:56.467 --> 51:00.091
even though she's straight
and I never cheated on you.

51:00.126 --> 51:01.748
Now I see why
you never made detective.

51:01.782 --> 51:03.922
Don't patronise me!

51:03.957 --> 51:05.545
You think you're so fantastic!

51:05.579 --> 51:06.891
You think you're so powerful!

51:06.925 --> 51:09.583
No, but at work I'm your boss,

51:09.618 --> 51:11.689
and I've still treated you
with respect

51:11.723 --> 51:13.829
the whole time you've
destroyed our relationship

51:13.863 --> 51:15.693
-with your paranoia.
-And out of work,

51:15.727 --> 51:18.247
what am I to you?

51:18.282 --> 51:19.904
You still act
like we're just friends.

51:19.938 --> 51:22.320
-You're ashamed of me!
-No, of course not.

51:22.355 --> 51:23.804
How come I've never met
your family?

51:25.806 --> 51:27.946
I don't have one.

51:27.981 --> 51:29.362
You're lying!

51:29.396 --> 51:31.709
Everyone has a family!

51:35.161 --> 51:37.611
This is why I'm leaving.

51:37.646 --> 51:40.166
This madness.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.168
I'm sorry, Jo,

51:43.203 --> 51:44.515
I'm sorry.

51:45.826 --> 51:47.794
I love you, Jo.

51:47.828 --> 51:51.384
Please don't go.

53:41.804 --> 53:44.497
Jo, he made a confession.

53:44.531 --> 53:45.912
It's not good enough, sir.

53:45.946 --> 53:47.327
No, this isn't good enough.

53:47.362 --> 53:48.604
This isn't good enough.

53:48.639 --> 53:50.606
This is your gig, Jo.

53:50.641 --> 53:51.883
Christ sake!

53:51.918 --> 53:53.333
I can see
you're frustrated, sir.

53:53.368 --> 53:54.748
Oh, really? Really?

53:54.783 --> 53:56.405
Thanks for that!

53:56.440 --> 53:57.786
Thanks a million!

53:57.820 --> 53:59.650
We need to consider
next steps.

53:59.684 --> 54:01.790
Look, what am I
gonna tell the Chief?

54:01.824 --> 54:04.344
I've explained everything
clearly, sir.

54:04.379 --> 54:06.381
Would you like me to go
through it again?

54:33.787 --> 54:37.308
Boss? You okay?

54:37.343 --> 54:38.792
I just took the Super
through my decision

54:38.827 --> 54:41.381
on Terry Boyle.

54:41.416 --> 54:43.556
I've recommended he be put
on police bail pending

54:43.590 --> 54:44.971
further inquiries.

54:45.005 --> 54:47.111
I've released him
without charge.

54:48.354 --> 54:49.596
Right.

54:49.631 --> 54:51.598
Don't look so surprised,
Kate.

54:51.633 --> 54:53.117
I wasn't born yesterday.

54:53.151 --> 54:54.567
The gun...

54:56.672 --> 54:59.365
The gunshot particles
aren't enough without spatter

54:59.399 --> 55:02.816
of Gail Vella's blood
or tissues.

55:02.851 --> 55:05.163
And the CHIS, Carl Banks,
Terry Boyle's flat.

55:05.198 --> 55:06.682
Something doesn't add up.

55:06.717 --> 55:08.650
Yeah. I agree, boss.

55:08.684 --> 55:11.135
I just want to catch the
bastard who killed Gail Vella.

55:11.169 --> 55:13.033
She's what this is all about.

55:13.068 --> 55:14.828
No way am I going after
someone like Terry Boyle,

55:14.863 --> 55:16.105
because he's the easy way out.

55:16.140 --> 55:17.555
Boss,

55:18.763 --> 55:20.317
is everything okay?

55:23.009 --> 55:24.597
Thanks, Kate.

55:28.980 --> 55:31.086
I should, uh...
-Yeah.

55:54.143 --> 55:55.973
The police
need to know where you are

55:56.007 --> 55:58.493
at all times, and your flat's
still a crime scene,

55:58.527 --> 56:00.080
so they've arranged for you
to stay in what they call

56:00.115 --> 56:01.910
Approved Premises.

56:01.944 --> 56:03.498
You'll be safe there, Terry.

56:03.532 --> 56:05.879
Thank you.
