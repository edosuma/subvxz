Donna, I need your help

18:08.131 --> 18:09.597
What's going on?
Is the jury back?

18:09.633 --> 18:11.983
No, I need to know
if Stephanie Liston still works

18:12.035 --> 18:14.118

She does, why?

18:14.120 --> 18:15.620

Harvey, if you're even

No, I'm not thinking

Was that a lie?

18:24.447 --> 18:25.807
- No, it wasn't.

It's called hedging.

getting a mistrial legally
