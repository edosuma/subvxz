Do you have any fours?

00:14.869 --> 00:16.469
Daffy, we're playing chess.

00:16.537 --> 00:19.339
Ah.

00:19.407 --> 00:21.508
Uh...

00:21.575 --> 00:26.100
Was it colonel snow in
the pantry with a candlestick?

00:26.168 --> 00:28.100
- Do you even know
how to play chess?

00:28.168 --> 00:30.729
Of course I do.

- No.

01:02.107 --> 01:03.639
Just look over there!

01:03.707 --> 01:06.041
- If I turn around,
you're gonna flip the board over

01:06.108 --> 01:07.576
And say it was an earthquake.

01:07.643 --> 01:09.545
No, I won't. I promise.

01:09.613 --> 01:12.215
Just look over there...Please?

That was a big one.

Oh, I better get going.

01:21.730 --> 01:23.831
I don't want to be late
for my singing lesson.

can't ever come bowling with us.

01:44.989 --> 01:48.624
- Yeah, but he's got
those darn singing lessons.

01:48.692 --> 01:52.828
- It's funny,
I've n-never heard him sing.

01:58.067 --> 01:59.534
Nice hairnet, Pam.

01:59.602 --> 02:01.869
Really shows off
that big forehead.

02:05.406 --> 02:06.706
Hey, Daffy.

- Hey!

02:09.943 --> 02:11.411
He-hey!

I thought the gang
could use some snacks

Courtesy of yours truly.

02:24.861 --> 02:26.061
How thoughtful!

02:26.128 --> 02:27.395
Thanks, Daffy.

02:27.463 --> 02:28.830
- I took a twenty
out of your wallet.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.998
Daffy, you're the best.

02:31.066 --> 02:34.501
- We couldn't ask for a more
generous team captain.

02:34.569 --> 02:36.671
- There's more
where that came from.

02:36.738 --> 02:38.739
There's more
where that came from, right?

02:38.807 --> 02:39.740
Ohh.

02:39.808 --> 02:41.642
Ho ho! Guess what.

02:41.710 --> 02:45.412
It's time for me to assign
everyone their weekly nicknames.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.415
Ooh! This is my favorite part.

02:48.483 --> 02:51.752
- Porky, your nickname
tonight...

02:51.819 --> 02:53.587
"the porkinator."

02:53.655 --> 02:55.289
[beeps]

02:56.558 --> 03:00.328

"The Peteinator"

[beeps]

03:01.931 --> 03:03.632
Oh, I like it!

03:03.700 --> 03:05.701
- Uh, D-Daffy?
- Hold on.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.304
Marvin, your nickname--

03:08.372 --> 03:09.972
"The Marvinator"?

03:10.040 --> 03:12.709
Nope. The, uh, uh...

03:12.777 --> 03:14.979
Ok, yeah, "The Marvinator."

03:15.046 --> 03:16.213
[beeps]

03:16.281 --> 03:17.381
Daffy?

03:17.449 --> 03:19.383
- I said hold on,
The Porkinator.

03:19.451 --> 03:22.386
And finally, since I
am the team captain,

03:22.454 --> 03:26.056
My nickname will be
"The Grand Poobah."

03:26.124 --> 03:30.727
Wait...Make that
"Poobah The Grand."

03:30.795 --> 03:32.729
[beeps]

03:32.797 --> 03:36.065
- Porky, I changed my mind.
You're player 4.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.167
Now let's bowl!

03:40.904 --> 03:42.104
All right, team.

03:42.172 --> 03:44.206
Now, if we're gonna win
the tournament this year,

03:44.274 --> 03:47.142
We're gonna have to
step up our game.

03:52.381 --> 03:53.514
[beeps]

03:53.582 --> 03:55.984
And that's how you do it!

03:56.051 --> 03:57.352

- Score!

03:57.420 --> 03:59.621
- Yeah!
- Way to go!

03:59.689 --> 04:01.023
Yay!

04:01.090 --> 04:03.258
- Well, if it
isn't Daffy Duck.

04:06.929 --> 04:09.697
Or should I
say Daffy dumb?

04:09.765 --> 04:11.466
[chuckles]

04:11.534 --> 04:14.702
- Laugh now, Terry, because
you'll be crying when we

04:14.770 --> 04:16.704
Wipe the floor with you
at the tournament.

04:16.772 --> 04:18.072
I don't think so.

04:18.140 --> 04:20.007
This is our year.

04:20.075 --> 04:21.608
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:21.676 --> 04:23.977
It's never your year, Terry.

04:24.045 --> 04:25.545
You're up, Poo.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.981
[grunting]

04:47.302 --> 04:48.235
Good try, Poo.

04:48.303 --> 04:49.236
Daffy?

04:49.304 --> 04:50.237
Bugs?!

04:50.305 --> 04:51.738
What are you doing here?

04:51.806 --> 04:53.340
I thought you had
your singing lesson.

04:53.408 --> 04:54.875
- Oh,
uh, I graduated.

04:54.942 --> 04:56.610
The teacher said I had
the voice of an angel.

04:56.677 --> 04:57.944
B-Bugs?

04:58.012 --> 05:00.080
I thought you had
your singing lesson--

05:00.147 --> 05:01.881
What are you doing here?

05:01.949 --> 05:03.783
- I was just sitting at
home doing nothing, so I--

05:03.851 --> 05:05.852
What's going on?

05:05.920 --> 05:07.787
- I told them both
conflicting lies, and now

05:07.855 --> 05:08.955
It's all falling ap--

05:09.022 --> 05:10.256
Let me get this straight.

05:10.324 --> 05:12.525
You're not
taking singing l--

05:12.592 --> 05:13.692
No.

05:13.760 --> 05:16.529
Daffy told me he was
taking singing les--

05:16.597 --> 05:18.865
- So this whole time he
said you were taking

05:18.932 --> 05:22.368
Singing lessons, you could
have been bowling with u--

05:22.436 --> 05:24.203

Yay, Bugs!

05:44.408 --> 05:46.108
All right, Bugs! Way to go!

05:46.176 --> 05:48.377
- I thought Daffy was good,
but you're gooder!

05:48.445 --> 05:52.048
Bugs, my office, now.

05:52.116 --> 05:53.182
Nice office.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.518
Well, I'm waiting.

05:55.586 --> 05:56.686
For what?

05:56.754 --> 05:58.254
Your apology.

05:58.322 --> 06:00.023
What? You lied to me.

06:00.091 --> 06:01.825
Why would I
apologize to you?

06:01.893 --> 06:03.493
Don't you see?

06:03.561 --> 06:06.163
I finally managed to cobble
together a circle of friends

06:06.230 --> 06:08.966
So pitiful that I'm
the cool one, and you're

06:09.033 --> 06:10.301
Blowing it for me.

06:10.368 --> 06:11.569
Daffy.

06:11.637 --> 06:14.172
- For some reason, people
think you're smarter than me,

06:14.239 --> 06:16.107
That you're more
talented to me,

06:16.175 --> 06:19.110
That you're better
looking than me.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.413
I personally don't see it.

06:21.481 --> 06:24.749
But when I'm here hanging
out with those nitwits,

06:24.817 --> 06:26.317
I'm the winner.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.453
I finally found a
place where I feel good

06:28.520 --> 06:32.323
About myself, and that
place is right here.

06:32.391 --> 06:35.092
[toilet flushes]

06:38.530 --> 06:42.565
- I just can't have those
guys like you more than me!

06:42.633 --> 06:45.535
- They don't like me
more than you.

06:45.603 --> 06:47.738
- Bugs!
- Bugs!

06:47.806 --> 06:51.676
- Ok, just tell them I had
to go to my karate class.

06:51.743 --> 06:53.144
Wh-where's Bugs?

06:53.212 --> 06:55.180
- He had to go to his
modern dance class.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.548
- Aw.
- Aw.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.717
- But I bought
everyone nachos!

06:58.785 --> 07:00.619
- Yay!
- Yay!

07:00.687 --> 07:02.655
Here you go, pork.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.095
That guy's good.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.998
- He's the newest
member of my team.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.976
What was that you said about
it never being my year?

07:23.043 --> 07:24.477
[chuckles]

07:24.545 --> 07:27.180
See you at the tournament.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.920
- I've n-never seen bowling
pins shatter like that.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.255
- Now how are we going
to win the tournament?

07:37.323 --> 07:39.524
[screeching]

07:43.929 --> 07:45.496
I'll tell you how.

07:45.563 --> 07:48.732
We're gonna train harder
than anyone has ever

07:48.799 --> 07:50.400
Trained before.

07:50.468 --> 07:54.805
This parking lot,
tomorrow morning, 7:00 A.M.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.812
Come on, Porky,
drive me home.

08:09.988 --> 08:11.689
Hmph.

08:14.126 --> 08:15.693
It's 11:30.

08:15.761 --> 08:18.997
You said the training
begins at 7:00 A.M.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.968
- The training began
at 7:00 A.M.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.038
The first exercise:
Patience.

08:25.106 --> 08:27.107
You two, great job.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.943
Porky, you've got some
catching up to do.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.211
Plus, the bowling alley
doesn't open till noon.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.748
See you guys in a half hour!

08:34.815 --> 08:36.482
- Bye!
- See you later!

08:36.549 --> 08:38.585
The bowling ball.

08:38.653 --> 08:43.256
The dictionary defines it
as a ball used for bowling.

08:43.323 --> 08:47.627
And that is why the
dictionary is stupid.

08:47.695 --> 08:51.665
Because to truly understand
the bowling ball,

08:51.733 --> 08:55.636
You need to become
the bowling ball.

08:55.704 --> 08:58.840
Are you s-sure about this?

08:58.907 --> 09:00.775
Bowling balls don't talk.

09:00.843 --> 09:01.943
Whoa!

Strike!

09:06.982 --> 09:07.981
Ohh, nice!

09:08.049 --> 09:10.484
- You can question my
methods, but you can't

09:10.552 --> 09:12.453
Question my results.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.688
Isn't that right, Porky?

09:17.859 --> 09:21.928
Porky, if you can hear me,
if never asked anything

09:21.996 --> 09:23.196
Of you in my life...

09:23.264 --> 09:24.731
I-I can hear you.

09:24.799 --> 09:28.135
- But in order to compete,
we need to have 4 people

09:28.203 --> 09:29.670
On the team.

09:29.738 --> 09:31.305
I-I said I can hear you.

09:31.373 --> 09:33.942
- I heard you all the
way down the hall.

09:34.009 --> 09:39.148
- So I want to ask you
this one tiny favor.

09:39.216 --> 09:43.519
Get out of that bed,
remove your I.V.,

09:43.587 --> 09:47.924
Take the casts
off your arms and legs,

09:47.992 --> 09:49.925
And bowl.

09:49.993 --> 09:53.562
That's all I ask.

09:53.629 --> 09:57.165
- Wh-why don't you just
ask Bugs to take my place?

09:57.233 --> 09:59.333
- Bugs is the
best bowler here.

09:59.401 --> 10:00.534
Right on.

10:00.602 --> 10:02.636
Yeah, what a great idea!

10:06.641 --> 10:11.278
- I'm jealous of Bugs,
but I hate Terry.

10:11.346 --> 10:13.915
Jealousy or hatred?

10:13.982 --> 10:19.221
It's like having to choose
one child over the other.

10:19.289 --> 10:21.590
Hatred--surprisingly
easy choice.

10:21.658 --> 10:22.958
Bugs, you want to bowl?

10:23.026 --> 10:24.026
Sure.

10:24.094 --> 10:25.194
- Yay!
- Yay!

10:25.262 --> 10:28.964
- Then let's
win one for Poo!

10:29.032 --> 10:31.334
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

10:33.370 --> 10:34.971

need your wallet.

Royal Oaks Lennox Oakwood
Lanes bowling tournament.

12:28.858 --> 12:30.925
I'm positively a-twitter!

12:30.993 --> 12:32.327
- Ooh,

Positively a gopher.

12:34.130 --> 12:36.131
[laughing]

12:36.198 --> 12:39.267
On lane one we have the
Silver Foxes, led by their

got there, Daffy.

13:00.022 --> 13:01.255
Are you nervous?

13:01.323 --> 13:03.057
- No,
I just happen to sweat more

13:03.124 --> 13:04.391
Than the average person.

13:04.459 --> 13:07.060
- Well, you're shaking.
You must be scared.

13:07.128 --> 13:09.028
- Nope, potassium
deficiency.

13:09.096 --> 13:10.496
- Well,
then how come you can't

13:10.564 --> 13:13.266
Look at me straight on?
You intimidated?

13:15.503 --> 13:16.770

13:16.838 --> 13:18.572

13:33.290 --> 13:35.491
She's getting ready.

13:38.228 --> 13:40.830
She's taking her time.

13:44.534 --> 13:50.472

14:52.472 --> 14:54.306
- What an
exciting tournament.

14:54.373 --> 14:56.475
- Two teams neck and
neck at the finish.

14:56.543 --> 14:58.744
- The Lucky Strikers
lead by one...

14:58.811 --> 15:00.913
- But Bugs Bunny
has one more left,

15:00.980 --> 15:03.281
And if he can knock over
just 2 pins...

15:03.349 --> 15:06.452
- Then Daffy's Ducks
win the tournament.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.354
- Ooh, we've got this
tournament in the bag!

15:09.422 --> 15:12.725
- We should call
ourselves Bugs's Ducks!

15:12.793 --> 15:14.494
[whimpers]

15:21.669 --> 15:23.771
Whoa! Ow!

15:23.839 --> 15:26.641
[all gasping]

15:26.708 --> 15:27.942
Are you ok?

15:28.010 --> 15:29.544
Wh-what happened?

15:29.612 --> 15:31.246
I twisted my ankle.

15:31.314 --> 15:34.783
I'm not gonna
be able to bowl.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.152
- Then how are we gonna
win the tournament?

15:37.219 --> 15:39.220
- You'll have
to bowl for me.

15:39.287 --> 15:44.758
After all, it's not Bugs's
Ducks, it's Daffy's Ducks.

15:44.826 --> 15:48.996
[gasps] you're faking.

15:49.064 --> 15:50.764
You are faking, right?

15:50.832 --> 15:52.733
Yes, I'm faking.

15:52.801 --> 15:55.068
Now go win the tournament!

16:02.677 --> 16:03.877
2 pins.

16:03.945 --> 16:06.179
That's all we need.

16:24.868 --> 16:26.335
[sighs and groans]

16:26.403 --> 16:28.471
Ha ha! Oh, yeah!

16:28.539 --> 16:29.706
This is the year!

16:29.774 --> 16:30.874
Ha ha!

16:30.942 --> 16:32.309
On you, Daffy!

16:32.376 --> 16:34.444
Ha ha! Oh, yeah!

16:34.512 --> 16:36.146
Oh, we're great!
We're great!

16:36.213 --> 16:38.181
Hold on. Do hold on.

16:38.249 --> 16:39.815
I'm getting word
that there's been

16:39.883 --> 16:41.817
A technical error.

16:41.885 --> 16:44.219
Apparently the pins were not
fully set before the player

16:44.287 --> 16:45.620
Released the ball.

16:45.688 --> 16:48.956
- League rules clearly state
that any technical error

16:49.024 --> 16:51.091
Results in an
automatic redo.

16:51.159 --> 16:53.561
[crowd gasps]

16:53.628 --> 16:56.230
- That means we have
a second chance to win!

16:56.298 --> 16:58.333
You hear that, Terry?

16:58.401 --> 17:00.869
I won't let you guys down.

17:00.937 --> 17:04.306
- Um, maybe we should
let Bugs bowl.

17:04.374 --> 17:06.843
- Yeah, I'm
feeling much better.

17:10.181 --> 17:12.782
Wait. I have to do it.

17:12.851 --> 17:15.786
I need to win the tournament
for the team...

17:15.853 --> 17:18.521
And for myself.

17:18.589 --> 17:19.723
Are you sure?

17:19.790 --> 17:21.656
It's 2 pins.

17:21.724 --> 17:25.962
I usually hit 4 to 5 pins.

17:26.029 --> 17:31.199
- Then go out there
and hit 4 to 5 pins!

17:31.267 --> 17:33.368
Or at least 2.

17:52.792 --> 17:56.061
- The Lucky Strikers
win the tournament!

17:56.128 --> 17:57.295
Ohh.

17:57.363 --> 17:58.596
Aww.

17:58.663 --> 17:59.763
Ha ha ha! Yeah!

17:59.831 --> 18:01.332
We're great! You're not!

18:01.399 --> 18:03.266
We're great! Oh, yeah!

18:03.334 --> 18:05.468
What a feeling!

What is going on?

21:26.413 --> 21:27.847
This is ridiculous.

21:27.914 --> 21:30.216
- So when do you get back
on your feet, Porky?

21:30.283 --> 21:32.785
- The doctor says with
enough physical therapy,

21:32.853 --> 21:34.853
I'll be able to
bowl in no time.

21:34.921 --> 21:36.855
Just needed my lucky ball!

21:36.923 --> 21:38.023
Aah!

21:38.090 --> 21:39.524
I'm--I'm not a ball!
