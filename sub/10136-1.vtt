06:53.330 --> 06:55.082
and then you'll be

06:55.123 --> 06:57.251
begging him for his autograph!

06:59.211 --> 07:02.881
What are you looking at? Go.

06:59.211 --> 07:02.881
The show's over, scatter, go.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.216
Yes, that's Czechinski.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.593
You spell it just

07:04.258 --> 07:06.593
the way it sounds.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.053
C-h..

07:08.095 --> 07:09.846
...chinsky.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.806
Oh, come on.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.806
You're directory assistance.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.142
Get your directory

07:11.848 --> 07:14.142
and assist me.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.686
Hello? Hello?

07:16.728 --> 07:19.564
Oh, boy, Alexander Graham Bell

07:16.728 --> 07:19.564
started this whole thing--

07:19.606 --> 07:22.276
Come on, Joey.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.276
D.J.'s plane's here.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.820
I can't wait to see

07:22.317 --> 07:25.820
that surprise.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.239
I hope it fits in the car.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.032
Girls, we're here to see D.J.,

07:27.281 --> 07:29.032
it doesn't matter

07:29.074 --> 07:30.617
what she brought us.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.493
Isn't Spain noted

07:30.658 --> 07:32.493
for their leather goods?

07:32.535 --> 07:33.995
Hmm-mm.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.581
<i>Los tanneritos.</i>

07:36.623 --> 07:39.126
-<i> Mi familia!</i>

07:36.623 --> 07:39.126
- Hi, Kimmy.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.669
- 'Hi, Kim.'

07:39.167 --> 07:41.669
- Kimmy, where is<i> su familia?</i>

07:41.711 --> 07:43.630
- My family?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.630
- Yeah, remember them?

07:43.671 --> 07:46.091
Sure, I do. They said,

07:43.671 --> 07:46.091
to come home with you.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.093
They figured you'd be

07:46.133 --> 07:48.093
going out for a fancy dinner

07:48.135 --> 07:49.761
and you would treat me.

07:51.638 --> 07:55.058
You know I haven't had

07:51.638 --> 07:55.058
a good lobster..

07:55.809 --> 07:56.977
...ever!

07:59.104 --> 08:00.897
Wouldn't it be great if they

07:59.104 --> 08:00.897
could lose the passengers

08:00.939 --> 08:03.442
instead of the luggage?

08:03.483 --> 08:07.321
- Where's D.J.?

08:03.483 --> 08:07.321
- I don't know.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.948
All I'm looking at is

08:07.362 --> 08:09.948
Romeo and Juliet over there.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.786
That girl Juliet

08:11.616 --> 08:14.786
looks like D.J.

08:18.457 --> 08:19.540
Hi, everybody!

08:19.582 --> 08:21.084
- Hey!

08:19.582 --> 08:21.084
- Hi.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.544
- Welcome home.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.544
- Good to see you.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.339
So, D.J.,

08:23.586 --> 08:25.339
what's the big surprise?

08:25.380 --> 08:26.589
Oh, right!

08:26.631 --> 08:29.217
Everybody, this is Steve.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.012
(all)

08:30.010 --> 08:32.012
Hi, Steve.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.142
So, D.J.,

08:34.764 --> 08:37.142
what's the big surprise?

08:37.184 --> 08:39.186
Steve is the surprise.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.396
We're going together.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.981
Surprise.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.443
So..

08:46.485 --> 08:48.028
'...uh..'

08:48.069 --> 08:50.113
You guys all came in one car?

08:51.365 --> 08:54.034
Excuse me, let me

08:51.365 --> 08:54.034
get this straight.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.495
He's the surprise?

08:57.954 --> 09:02.459
It's now official.

08:57.954 --> 09:02.459
My summer is down the tubes.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.295
Ask her where our presents are.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.423
Steve.

09:10.633 --> 09:14.429
Welcome to the family, my son.

09:14.471 --> 09:18.433
Someday, we may call

09:14.471 --> 09:18.433
on you for a favor.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.852
And when I do, Steve, Michael..

09:22.603 --> 09:25.315
What I think the godfather is

09:22.603 --> 09:25.315
trying to say is..

09:25.357 --> 09:27.984
What exactly do you two

09:25.357 --> 09:27.984
mean by "Going together?"

09:28.026 --> 09:30.695
Come on, Mr. T.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.695
You're not that old.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.449
It means they can't keep

09:30.737 --> 09:34.449
their paws off each other.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.868
<i>Silencio, el</i> big mouth.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.038
<i>Si, adios.</i>

09:36.910 --> 09:40.038
<i>Hasta la</i> baggage.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.124
Well, you guys remember Steve.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.959
We went out a couple of times

09:43.166 --> 09:44.959
times last year.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.087
(all)

09:45.001 --> 09:47.087
Uh-huh.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.671
Funny, I don't recall

09:47.128 --> 09:48.671
your mentioning that

09:48.713 --> 09:50.631
he's going to Spain with you.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.134
I didn't even know he was

09:50.673 --> 09:53.134
in the foreign study program

09:53.176 --> 09:55.887
until we saw each other

09:53.176 --> 09:55.887
on the flight over there.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.265
<i>Nunca olvidare</i>

09:55.929 --> 09:58.265
<i>ese momento.</i>

09:58.306 --> 10:01.893
<i>Estoy el hombre mas</i>

09:58.306 --> 10:01.893
<i>contento del mundo.</i>

10:02.852 --> 10:05.522
<i>En ingles, por favor.</i>

10:05.564 --> 10:08.108
Mr. Tanner, sir,

10:05.564 --> 10:08.108
I just want you to know

10:08.149 --> 10:10.151
that your daughter's

10:08.149 --> 10:10.151
been in good hands.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.153
We don't want her in any hands.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.450
Uh, you know, Deej,

10:13.572 --> 10:16.450
I told my folks

10:16.491 --> 10:18.243
I'd meet them at baggage claim.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.578
I'll catch you down there.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.581
Uh...great seeing

10:19.619 --> 10:22.581
you all again.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.960
I can't believe this.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.503
You're treating me like a child.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.047
Well, D.J., you're not

10:28.545 --> 10:31.047
acting like an adult.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.258
Making out in an

10:31.089 --> 10:33.258
international terminal.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.802
What will people

10:33.300 --> 10:35.802
think of America?

10:35.843 --> 10:37.512
Oh, dad.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.141
You know what, could you, uh,

10:39.055 --> 10:41.141
excuse us for a moment?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.477
Oh, sure. Jess, let's go

10:41.182 --> 10:43.477
call Aunt Ida.

10:43.518 --> 10:46.187
Why? Ow! Oh, that's why.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.564
- You, too.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.564
- Ow!

10:47.606 --> 10:49.608
I don't have an Aunt Ida.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.820
Dad, how could you embarrass me

10:51.318 --> 10:53.820
in front of Steve like that?

10:53.861 --> 10:55.363
Look, I'm sorry I just thought

10:53.861 --> 10:55.363
when you were getting

10:55.405 --> 10:57.240
off the plane

10:55.405 --> 10:57.240
you'd be kissing us.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.370
Maybe I should have prepared

10:59.367 --> 11:02.370
you a little more for Steve.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.873
It would've helped, a lot.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.334
D.J., I knew when

11:05.915 --> 11:07.334
you went to Spain that

11:07.375 --> 11:09.336
you'd be...going out with boys.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.130
I, I just thought you'd

11:09.377 --> 11:12.130
leave them there.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.091
Dad, Steve is a great guy.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.343
He's a senior.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.676
He's on the wrestling team.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.096
He recycles.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.680
I'm sure he's wonderful.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.682
Honey, I want to know

11:21.722 --> 11:23.682
everything about your trip.

11:23.724 --> 11:26.019
You've been gone for so long.

11:23.724 --> 11:26.019
You have no idea.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.395
I missed you so much.

11:27.437 --> 11:31.232
I missed you too.

11:27.437 --> 11:31.232
Tell you what.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.276
When we go home,

11:31.274 --> 11:33.276
we'll have a cup of coffee

11:33.318 --> 11:34.819
and I'll tell you

11:33.318 --> 11:34.819
all about my trip.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.821
That'd be really..

11:36.863 --> 11:38.657
Coffee?

11:38.697 --> 11:40.699
Since when do you

11:38.697 --> 11:40.699
drink coffee?

11:40.741 --> 11:43.370
Actually,<i> cafe con leche.</i>

11:43.411 --> 11:45.913
Honey, in this country,

11:43.411 --> 11:45.913
we don't drink<i> cafe con leche.</i>

11:45.955 --> 11:47.874
We drink chocolate milk.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.503
Dad, I'm almost 16.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.503
I've been to Europe.

11:51.545 --> 11:55.006
I really think I'm old enough

11:51.545 --> 11:55.006
to choose my own beverage.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.133
Sweetheart, I didn't choose my

11:55.048 --> 11:57.133
own beverage until I was 21.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.553
And even then, my mom

11:57.175 --> 11:59.553
chose chocolate milk.

12:00.554 --> 12:03.097
Dad that is so provincial.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.183
Provincial?

12:05.225 --> 12:08.895
Nothing ending in I-N-S-K-Y?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.980
I know she's out there.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.608
Well, has a woman called

12:11.022 --> 12:13.608
asking for the phone number

12:13.650 --> 12:15.527
of a Joey Gladstone?

12:17.070 --> 12:20.073
Uh, no, Aunt Ida, I don't think

12:17.070 --> 12:20.073
it's such a good idea

12:20.114 --> 12:21.782
for you to give

12:20.114 --> 12:21.782
the twins haircuts.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.410
What? Give me that phone. Ida!

12:23.451 --> 12:26.829
I mean, uh, I mean,

12:23.451 --> 12:26.829
dear, dear, Aunt Ida.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.206
Listen, I know

12:26.871 --> 12:28.206
you want to help.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.417
Uh, you know,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.417
give 'em a sandwich

12:30.458 --> 12:33.961
give 'em, give 'em a bath,

12:30.458 --> 12:33.961
give 'em a tattoo if you want.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.796
Just don't cut their hair.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.258
Hey, kid.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.926
Are you coming or going?

12:39.967 --> 12:42.053
[speaking French]

12:43.680 --> 12:46.516
If you say so.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.851
I think she's from

12:46.558 --> 12:48.851
another country.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.020
Duh.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.564
Actually, we're

12:51.062 --> 12:52.564
the international

12:52.606 --> 12:53.814
young people's choir.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.066
We're on our world tour.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.235
We've been to 14 countries.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.904
Fascinating.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.116
We've been to

13:01.072 --> 13:03.116
nowheres-ville.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.744
Is that where

13:03.157 --> 13:05.744
I got sick in the car?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.623
Kids.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.458
- So, what's your name?

13:09.664 --> 13:11.458
- Terry.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.626
- Hi, I'm Stephanie.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.626
- Hi.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.419
Come on, kids we're going.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.337
I'm sorry, I have to go now.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.672
Oh, right now?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.840
You can come aboard

13:17.714 --> 13:19.840
and see us off?

13:19.882 --> 13:21.800
Why, thank you.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.304
Come on, Michelle.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.388
Follow that hunk.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.806
But I wanna see D.J.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.850
Well, she doesn't wanna see us.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.770
All she cares about is Steve.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.146
At least, we'll have

13:31.810 --> 13:33.146
<i>five minutes</i>

13:33.187 --> 13:34.522
of fun this summer.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.734
Yeah, later for her.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.779
Coffee is just

13:38.985 --> 13:40.779
hot water and beans

13:40.819 --> 13:42.572
but chocolate milk

13:40.819 --> 13:42.572
does a body good.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.824
Hang on, hang on,

13:42.614 --> 13:45.824
I'm trying to count kids.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.953
(Michelle)

13:45.866 --> 13:48.953
'Stephanie are you sure

13:45.866 --> 13:48.953
dad won't be mad?'

13:48.995 --> 13:52.707
(Stephanie)

13:48.995 --> 13:52.707
'Relax, we'll be back before

13:48.995 --> 13:52.707
he knows we're gone.'

13:52.749 --> 13:56.711
Hi, nice to meet you.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.711
Stephanie Tanner, USA.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.797
Stephanie Tanner, USA.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.800
Michelle Tanner, C-A-T.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.385
- Michelle.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.385
- That's all I could spell.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.638
Okay, children,

14:04.427 --> 14:06.638
please find your seats.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.973
I get the window!

14:09.015 --> 14:10.809
(Stephanie)

14:09.015 --> 14:10.809
'Michelle, what are you doing?'

14:10.849 --> 14:12.268
We're not going anywhere.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.604
- Can't we just pretend?

14:12.310 --> 14:14.604
- No.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.231
Hello, Stephanie.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.067
Hi.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.778
Maybe for a minute.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.699
Goodbye, everyone.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.699
We're going to..

14:25.740 --> 14:28.159
Excuse me, where is

14:25.740 --> 14:28.159
this plane going to?

14:28.201 --> 14:30.244
- Auckland.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.244
- Oakland!

14:30.286 --> 14:33.623
That's right across the bay.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.623
Why don't they just drive there?

14:33.665 --> 14:35.792
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:33.665 --> 14:35.792
prepare for takeoff.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.503
Please fasten

14:35.834 --> 14:38.503
your seat belts.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.921
Oh, no! We're moving.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.716
Time out! Hit the brakes!

14:40.963 --> 14:42.716
This is our stop!

14:42.757 --> 14:44.925
Come on now, there's nothing

14:42.757 --> 14:44.925
to be afraid of.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.594
- We've gotta get off.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.594
- Believe me.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.138
Airplanes are the

14:46.636 --> 14:49.138
safest form of travel.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.724
Besides, you should be

14:49.180 --> 14:50.724
used to traveling by now.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.809
Now, why don't you just relax

14:50.765 --> 14:52.809
and buckle up?

14:52.851 --> 14:54.561
- But..

14:52.851 --> 14:54.561
- It's the law.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.732
You heard her.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.732
Buckle up, it's the law.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.735
- Mm-hmm?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.735
- Excuse me.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.362
I'm, uh, doing

15:01.776 --> 15:04.362
a report for school.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.906
I was wondering,

15:04.404 --> 15:06.906
what would happen if someone

15:06.947 --> 15:08.616
snuck on a plane

15:06.947 --> 15:08.616
without a ticket?

15:08.658 --> 15:11.118
Well, they'd be a stowaway

15:08.658 --> 15:11.118
which is a federal crime.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.080
That person could go to prison

15:11.160 --> 15:14.080
for a long, long time.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.751
Great, I'll put that

15:15.582 --> 15:17.751
in my report.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.630
I'm really not in the mood

15:19.085 --> 15:22.630
to go to prison.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.551
We're not going to prison.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.261
We're just going to Oakland.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.221
We should be there

15:28.302 --> 15:30.221
in about five minutes.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.265
And we'll call

15:30.263 --> 15:32.265
dad to pick us up.

15:32.306 --> 15:35.769
I'm sure he'll see the humor

15:32.306 --> 15:35.769
in the situation.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.978
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:35.810 --> 15:37.978
welcome to flight 40.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.731
We should be arriving

15:38.020 --> 15:39.731
at our destination

15:39.773 --> 15:42.442
Auckland, New Zealand,

15:39.773 --> 15:42.442
in 14 hours.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.193
"Auckland, New Zealand?"

15:44.235 --> 15:46.905
"14 hours?"

15:46.946 --> 15:50.074
- Aah!

15:52.159 --> 15:54.245
[instrumental music]

15:57.791 --> 15:59.626
[instrumental music]

16:03.003 --> 16:06.340
Stephanie, do they have

16:03.003 --> 16:06.340
ice cream in New Zealand?

16:07.926 --> 16:10.804
I don't know, Michelle.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.804
I've never been to New Zealand.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.474
But they probably do, right?

16:15.892 --> 16:17.143
Who cares?

16:17.184 --> 16:19.979
Don't you understand

16:17.184 --> 16:19.979
we're going to jail?

16:20.855 --> 16:22.315
Oh, right.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.276
Do they have

16:23.274 --> 16:25.276
ice cream in jail?

16:26.569 --> 16:30.239
Michelle, try to stay

16:26.569 --> 16:30.239
with me on this.

16:30.281 --> 16:33.910
We are looking<i> at hard time.</i>

16:33.952 --> 16:36.621
I've got 14 hours

16:33.952 --> 16:36.621
to figure out a plan.

16:36.663 --> 16:40.792
Now, the key is, don't act

16:36.663 --> 16:40.792
suspicious and stay calm.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.335
- Beverage?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.335
- Alright, we did it.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.753
We snuck on the plane.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.172
Please, please,<i> please</i>

16:43.795 --> 16:46.172
have mercy on us.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.593
That was your plan?

16:52.219 --> 16:55.515
Hi, is this Mary?

16:52.219 --> 16:55.515
Mary Czechinski?

16:55.556 --> 16:58.685
C-Z-E-C-H-I-N-S-K-I?

16:58.726 --> 17:00.645
Yes! I finally found you.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.313
It's-it's me, Joey Gladstone.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.648
Remember? From the beach?

17:03.690 --> 17:04.858
You loved my impressions

17:04.899 --> 17:07.026
especially my Tasmanian devil.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.153
[imitation of Tasmanian devil]

17:11.447 --> 17:13.992
No, wait.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.992
Don't-Don't call the police.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.075
This is Mary, right?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.411
With the long blonde hair?

17:17.453 --> 17:19.372
Short blue hair.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.833
86 years old.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.501
Are you single?

17:24.711 --> 17:27.380
Yes, I, listen

17:24.711 --> 17:27.380
we will cut their hair.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.383
No, no. It'll-it'll be before

17:27.421 --> 17:30.383
hell freezes over.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.636
Yeah, I was kind of thinking

17:30.424 --> 17:33.636
maybe when pigs fly. Yeah.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.555
Excuse me, aren't you Jesse

17:35.596 --> 17:37.515
from "Jesse and the Rippers?"

17:37.557 --> 17:38.892
Gotta go, Ida.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.560
- Why, yes I am. Hi.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.560
- Hi.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.854
I saw you play last month

17:40.601 --> 17:42.854
at the Boise Bowl-o-Rama.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.397
You were excellent.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.607
Really?

17:46.649 --> 17:48.568
I was excellent.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.361
- Uh, what's your name?

17:48.609 --> 17:50.361
- Roberta.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.238
Roberta, hi.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.238
Nice to see you, Roberta.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.407
Hey, everybody,

17:52.279 --> 17:54.407
this is Roberta.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.410
My fan.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.410
Oh, I see you got a camera.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.953
You wanna get

17:57.451 --> 17:58.953
a picture of us together?

17:58.995 --> 18:00.872
- Oh, no, that's okay.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.872
- It's no inconvenience, really.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.832
Here, look, just smile.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.832
Ready? And smile!

18:02.874 --> 18:05.334
Very good. Nice picture. Look.

18:02.874 --> 18:05.334
Can you send me a copy of this?

18:05.376 --> 18:07.086
Honey do you have a pen?

18:05.376 --> 18:07.086
Because we'll give her our ad..

18:07.127 --> 18:08.588
You know what, there's

18:07.127 --> 18:08.588
a one-hour photo here.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.006
We'll sit down at the cafeteria,

18:08.629 --> 18:10.006
we'll have a Danish

18:10.048 --> 18:11.632
we'll talk about the concert.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.632
You wanna do that?

18:11.674 --> 18:13.342
- Oh, maybe some other time.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.342
- It's really no problem.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.969
- It was nice meeting you.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.969
- Nice to meet you, Roberta.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.221
Hey thanks.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.221
You forgot your camera.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.891
(Roberta)

18:17.263 --> 18:19.891
'Keep it.'

18:19.933 --> 18:21.100
What's her problem?

18:21.141 --> 18:22.643
Oh, you know

18:21.141 --> 18:22.643
how those fans are.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.312
They get so tired of being

18:22.685 --> 18:25.312
mobbed by big stars.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.733
You think I came on

18:26.647 --> 18:28.733
a little strong?

18:28.775 --> 18:30.735
Jess, you practically

18:28.775 --> 18:30.735
mugged her.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.529
Guys! Guys!

18:33.571 --> 18:36.115
Michelle...uh, Stephanie..

18:36.156 --> 18:37.283
...on a, on a..

18:37.324 --> 18:38.826
- Uh, uh..

18:37.324 --> 18:38.826
- On a..

18:38.868 --> 18:40.536
- Turkey, turkey?

18:38.868 --> 18:40.536
- No.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.038
That's not, this is a turkey.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.038
Gobble, gobble..

18:42.080 --> 18:43.790
- That's a turkey.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.790
- That's, that's a pigeon.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.416
Now, you're doing a sea gull.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.584
Hey, hey, hey.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.252
What dad is trying

18:46.626 --> 18:48.252
to say is that

18:48.294 --> 18:50.337
he just talked to security

18:48.294 --> 18:50.337
and Stephanie and Michelle

18:50.379 --> 18:52.172
are on a plane to New Zealand.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.717
- Thank you.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.717
- What? We gotta stop the plane.

18:54.759 --> 18:57.344
Dad tried. They won't

18:54.759 --> 18:57.344
turn the plane around.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.346
They said as soon as

18:57.386 --> 18:59.346
the plane lands in New Zealand

18:59.388 --> 19:02.266
they'll put the girls in

18:59.388 --> 19:02.266
the next flight back here.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.102

19:02.308 --> 19:04.102
must be scared to death.

Thanks, Susie.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.649
New Zealand was so fun.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.027
Michelle, that

19:51.691 --> 19:54.027
wasn't New Zealand.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.570
That was the airport gift shop.

Here comes dad. Act sad

19:58.447 --> 20:01.367
so he'll feel sorry for us.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.540
- Perfect.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.540
- 'Girls!'

20:07.581 --> 20:09.458
Oh, thank god you're okay.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.919
You alright?

20:14.172 --> 20:15.673
I am so sorry.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.092
I imagine, this sorta thing

20:15.715 --> 20:18.092
happens all the time.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.385
Not really.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.428
- Bye-bye, girls.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.428
- Bye, Susie!

20:21.470 --> 20:23.056
(Stephanie)

20:21.470 --> 20:23.056
'Michelle!'

20:23.097 --> 20:25.892
I mean, bye, Susie.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.435
You two have any idea

20:25.933 --> 20:28.435
how worried we were?

20:28.477 --> 20:29.729
Why in the world would

20:28.477 --> 20:29.729
you get on that plane

20:29.770 --> 20:30.771
in the first place?

20:30.813 --> 20:32.106
We're really sorry.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.483
- It was an accident.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.483
- An accident?

20:34.525 --> 20:37.028
You accidentally walked on

20:34.525 --> 20:37.028
the plane, accidentally sat down

20:37.070 --> 20:39.197
and accidentally

20:37.070 --> 20:39.197
flew to New Zealand?

20:39.238 --> 20:42.075
Okay, it was a freak accident.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.994
I don't think they bought it.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.620
You two are not supposed

20:45.036 --> 20:46.620
to cross the street

20:46.662 --> 20:49.999
without telling us,

20:46.662 --> 20:49.999
let alone cross the Pacific.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.501
Huh, dad, can we

20:50.041 --> 20:52.501
discuss this later?

20:52.543 --> 20:53.586
Sure, we'll discuss it later.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.921
Later at home tonight

20:54.962 --> 20:57.048
later home tomorrow, next week

your high school graduations

20:58.591 --> 21:00.676
for the rest of your lives.

[instrumental music]

21:11.437 --> 21:13.689
Some fun, huh, Michelle?

21:13.731 --> 21:15.524
Remember on the plane

21:13.731 --> 21:15.524
we kept saying

21:15.566 --> 21:18.194
"We wanna go home,

21:15.566 --> 21:18.194
we wanna go home?"

21:18.236 --> 21:19.528
- 'Yeah.'

21:18.236 --> 21:19.528
- Well, why are we home?

21:19.570 --> 21:22.031
And I wanna go back

21:19.570 --> 21:22.031
on the plane.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.284
Because we're grounded

21:23.532 --> 21:25.284
for a month.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.036
Any more questions?

21:28.370 --> 21:32.208
Yes, why do grown-ups

21:28.370 --> 21:32.208
have hair up their nose?

21:34.668 --> 21:37.880
- Hey, how you guys doing?

21:34.668 --> 21:37.880
- More questions.

21:37.922 --> 21:41.634
Speaking of questions,

21:37.922 --> 21:41.634
I have one. Are you nuts?

21:41.675 --> 21:43.510
What made you get on

21:41.675 --> 21:43.510
that plane to New Zealand?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.846
That's two questions.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.308
We had a crummy summer

21:47.389 --> 21:49.308
then you came back

21:49.349 --> 21:51.102
and didn't even care about us.

21:51.144 --> 21:54.021
We just wanted

21:51.144 --> 21:54.021
to have some fun.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.982
What do you mean

21:54.063 --> 21:55.982
I didn't care about you?

21:56.023 --> 21:59.152
You were too busy

21:56.023 --> 21:59.152
kissing Steve.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.114
I'm sorry, you guys.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.323
Just because I have a boyfriend

22:04.364 --> 22:06.575
doesn't mean I don't

22:04.364 --> 22:06.575
care about you.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.911
I missed you both like crazy.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.454
You did?

22:10.496 --> 22:12.206
Of course.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.834
Look, a lot of things

22:12.248 --> 22:14.834
changed for me this summer.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.210
One thing that will<i> never</i> change

22:16.252 --> 22:18.754
is how much I love you guys.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.590
Love you too.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.305
But what if you marry Steve

22:24.343 --> 22:27.305
and have 10 children

22:27.345 --> 22:29.598
and two dogs and a horse

22:27.345 --> 22:29.598
and lived in a big house

22:29.640 --> 22:31.225
have one of those

22:29.640 --> 22:31.225
bathrooms where water

22:31.267 --> 22:32.893
comes out of a golden swan--

22:32.935 --> 22:36.647
Steph, trust me.

22:32.935 --> 22:36.647
I'll love you.

22:36.689 --> 22:37.857
Okay.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.693
Oh, I almost forgot.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.278
I have presents for you guys.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.529
I knew it!

22:43.570 --> 22:45.739
Not that we were

22:43.570 --> 22:45.739
expecting anything.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.743
[instrumental music]

22:50.953 --> 22:52.788
Thank you!

22:52.830 --> 22:54.957
You're welcome.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.876
- Thank you.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.876
- You're welcome.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.336
(Michelle)

22:56.917 --> 22:58.336
'I like it.'
