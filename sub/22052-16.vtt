verifying that information when

>> KRIS: I barely met...

42:02.500 --> 42:06.133
>> SCOTT: Right, so, why would
I, like...

42:06.133 --> 42:08.934
>> KRIS: I don't know.
All right, well, will you keep

42:08.934 --> 42:11.734
me posted?
>> SCOTT: On what?

42:11.734 --> 42:13.700
>> KRIS: I just want to know
what's going on with you.

42:13.700 --> 42:18.800
I think it's a little weird if
you've got a significant change

42:18.800 --> 42:22.300
in life and I haven't really
heard that much about it.

42:22.300 --> 42:26.767
And I have to pull it out of you
like I'm fishing for salmon.

42:26.767 --> 42:28.500
>> SCOTT: You ever fished for
salmon?

42:28.500 --> 42:30.500
>> KRIS: No.
>> SCOTT: For me, to see that

42:30.500 --> 42:33.100
Kris is invested in my life
means the world to me because

42:33.100 --> 42:37.767
she's got so many other kids and
so much other things going on.

42:37.767 --> 42:39.867
The fact that she actually
worries, loves and cares about

42:39.867 --> 42:42.667
me is probably one of the best
feelings I have.

42:42.667 --> 42:45.000
And truthfully, as much as I'd
like to be honest with her and

42:45.000 --> 42:48.600
tell her how I'm really feeling,
I also do want to respect

42:48.600 --> 42:52.567
Kourtney and her feelings.
Maybe down the line, but right

42:52.567 --> 42:55.266
now, you know, my biggest thing
is just being respectful of

42:55.266 --> 42:57.867
everybody.
>> KRIS: I just... I don't know,

42:57.867 --> 43:01.934
feel like I'm always gonna be
your mom.

43:01.934 --> 43:03.600
>> SCOTT: Agreed.
>> KRIS: So...

43:03.600 --> 43:05.066
>> PENELOPE: Agree.
>> KRIS: ...you might as well

43:05.066 --> 43:06.600
just surrender.
>> PENELOPE: Agree.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.600
>> SCOTT: I did a long time ago.
>> KRIS: To the nonsense.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.333
>> SCOTT: When I used to have to

43:10.333 --> 43:12.500
take the trash out.

43:12.500 --> 43:15.800
I surrendered then.
>> KIM: On the next episode...

43:15.800 --> 43:18.266
>> KHLOE: A self-centered bitch.
>> KOURTNEY: What?

43:18.266 --> 43:20.633
>> KHLOE: Malika.
Her and I have been feuding.

43:20.633 --> 43:23.533
>> KOURTNEY: For Khloe and
Malika to not be speaking, I

43:23.533 --> 43:26.433
know that it must be serious.
>> KIM: Stop. You did

43:26.433 --> 43:28.467
interviews?
>> KRIS: Robert came over one

43:28.467 --> 43:31.100
day when Cesar was out of town.
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God, you're

43:31.100 --> 43:35.533
such a whore.

43:35.533 --> 43:36.934
>> KRIS: Hi.
>> KENDALL: It's an emergency.

43:36.934 --> 43:38.533
>> KRIS: Do you want me to come
take you to the hospital?
