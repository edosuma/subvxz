<i>How many are there, rug?</i>

00:52.905 --> 00:56.329
<i>What am I up against, huh?</i>

02:19.929 --> 02:21.434
Hey, hey, wait.

02:22.585 --> 02:24.665
I know the code for the door.

02:26.168 --> 02:27.642
<i>Leave it.</i>

02:33.113 --> 02:36.447
Come on, brother. Let us out.

02:36.954 --> 02:38.127
Come on.

02:54.201 --> 02:58.202
<i>2258#.</i>

02:59.352 --> 03:01.657
2258#.

03:09.401 --> 03:11.162
We can't take them.

03:11.193 --> 03:12.633
Yes, we can.

03:15.449 --> 03:17.145
<i>Come on, bub.</i>

03:17.177 --> 03:18.536
<i>Let me in, eh?</i>

03:20.250 --> 03:21.856
<i>Don't lock me out.</i>

03:28.697 --> 03:30.618
<i>Dad? Dad?</i>

03:30.650 --> 03:33.370
Dad? Dad, are you in there?

03:33.401 --> 03:35.578
- What's your friend's name?
- Djukara.

03:35.610 --> 03:37.562
Forget him. We have to leave now.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.577
Take these fellas and get out of here.

03:56.729 --> 03:58.553
How many are there, rug?

03:58.584 --> 04:00.626

Keep everything secure and
wait for further instruction.

05:07.079 --> 05:08.667
<i>Yes, sir. Copy that.</i>

05:19.099 --> 05:20.731
- How many escaped?
- Three.

05:20.761 --> 05:22.598
I've cleared the area of personnel.

05:23.642 --> 05:24.886
Keep them waiting.

05:36.154 --> 05:37.260
McIntyre.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.083
Yeah.

05:40.762 --> 05:41.970
I'm not concerned.

05:42.363 --> 05:43.715
This is good for us.

05:46.459 --> 05:47.867
I got my hands full at the moment.

05:47.898 --> 05:49.530
I'll call you back in 10.

06:30.778 --> 06:32.570
Need to see some ID.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.042
I come through here every day.

06:34.074 --> 06:36.315
No ID, no entry.

06:37.114 --> 06:38.875
This is bull crap.

06:53.339 --> 06:54.748
He's all right, mate.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.041
I got him, I got him, I got him.

08:02.171 --> 08:04.123
- I got him.
- <i>Need some help here!</i>

08:09.082 --> 08:11.003
Put him up on the bed.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.716
Okay, take your hands off. Take 'em off.

08:18.235 --> 08:20.602
Oh, okay. I need some more compresses.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.106
He's lost a lot of blood.

08:22.137 --> 08:23.630
Yeah, he's going to need
to go to a hospital.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.818
- No, we have to fix him here.
- No, we can't.

08:25.849 --> 08:27.129
They're the same as us.

08:27.162 --> 08:28.377
They've got a totally
different physiology.

08:28.410 --> 08:29.850
Now, I've only treated some for cuts.

08:29.881 --> 08:31.469
<i>Well, that's more than most.</i>

08:31.502 --> 08:32.476
Boys, keep quiet.

08:32.501 --> 08:33.243
<i>I'm a GP. He needs a surgeon.</i>

08:33.274 --> 08:36.664
What do you want me to do?
Call the emergency ward?

08:36.698 --> 08:39.177
We contact the authorities,
he's as good as dead.

08:39.674 --> 08:41.211
Eve, put your hands here.

08:42.712 --> 08:44.441
How long has he been unconscious for?

08:44.474 --> 08:46.042
- He's been in and out.
- He's been shot.

08:49.762 --> 08:52.347
Okay, he's going to need
a blood transfusion.

08:52.378 --> 08:54.500
- I need blood.
- He can have mine.

08:54.525 --> 08:55.962
Well, what if it's not the same type?

08:55.993 --> 08:57.785
Well, I'll guess we'll find out.

08:57.818 --> 08:58.522
Eve, I need you to run a tap.

08:58.555 --> 08:59.995
Yep. Hold this, Waruu. Hold it.

09:00.026 --> 09:01.498
Nice and tight.

09:05.593 --> 09:07.385
Get in!

09:07.417 --> 09:08.667
Damn you.

09:09.337 --> 09:12.133
Okay, your turn, big guy.
Take off the coat.

09:12.603 --> 09:14.985
Prep him, Eve. Prep him.

09:31.417 --> 09:32.666
How'd they find this place?

09:32.698 --> 09:35.067
It's supposed to be
a clandestine operation.

09:39.065 --> 09:39.877
<i>Animals.</i>

09:42.169 --> 09:43.901
Get the media in.

09:44.123 --> 09:45.498
I want this image beamed

09:45.530 --> 09:47.431
across every screen in the country.

09:54.521 --> 09:56.026
<i>So, can we keep her?</i>

09:56.058 --> 09:58.803
<i>Not funny, Blair. She can't stay here.</i>

09:59.929 --> 10:01.598
Stop, okay? Enough!

10:02.937 --> 10:04.118
Why'd you call me?

10:05.785 --> 10:06.809
I did what you asked.

10:06.841 --> 10:08.154
I broke you out of that weird shit lab.

10:08.186 --> 10:10.415
You know, why can't I hear you now?

10:11.610 --> 10:12.647
Talk to me.

10:13.205 --> 10:14.614
I need to know what's going on.

10:21.019 --> 10:23.067
Just tell me who you are!

10:30.297 --> 10:32.606
- Whoa!
- Shit.

10:32.638 --> 10:33.441
Koen! Koen!

10:33.466 --> 10:35.833
<i>What did you... what did you just do?</i>

10:35.866 --> 10:37.019
You crazy bitch. What did you do to him?

10:37.050 --> 10:38.681
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:39.355 --> 10:41.371
<i>- Koen.</i>
- Hey.

10:41.402 --> 10:42.041
Hey.

10:42.074 --> 10:43.062
Koen?

10:43.547 --> 10:45.147
Hey. Stay there.

10:45.630 --> 10:48.026
- Koen.
- Bruz? Hey, Bruz.

10:48.057 --> 10:49.226
Koen!

10:49.681 --> 10:50.308
Hey!

10:51.661 --> 10:53.519
Koen. Koen!

10:57.421 --> 10:58.125
I want those three escapees

10:58.158 --> 11:00.495
back in custody by the 6:00 news.

11:47.853 --> 11:50.605
Halt! You! Halt!

11:52.174 --> 11:54.237
Suspect subhuman in quadrant six.

11:55.469 --> 11:56.947
Give us an image.

11:59.895 --> 12:01.307
Facial recognition.

12:06.283 --> 12:08.877
- <i>He's a free-ranger.</i>
<i>- A what?</i>

12:08.910 --> 12:10.758
He's not one of your breakout boys.

12:38.701 --> 12:40.110
We lost him.

12:41.998 --> 12:43.272
Not good enough.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.681
Damn it.

12:53.965 --> 12:55.694
Do you think that's funny?

12:57.645 --> 12:58.798
- Bastard!
- Ash!

13:06.959 --> 13:09.550
- What?
- Nothing.

13:09.582 --> 13:10.592
Bruz?

13:10.958 --> 13:13.145
What just happened to you?

13:13.678 --> 13:16.047
You touched her and,
boom, you're out cold,

13:16.078 --> 13:18.094
like you got hit by
electricity or something.

13:18.126 --> 13:20.367
Did you see something
when you touched her?

13:20.399 --> 13:21.384
Nah, nothing.

13:21.677 --> 13:23.121
Oi, Ash, don't.

13:26.190 --> 13:27.694
It's too freaking weird.

13:57.562 --> 13:58.428
Morning.

14:00.954 --> 14:02.619
Welcome to our space.

14:04.762 --> 14:06.300
Have you got an appointment?

14:06.874 --> 14:09.754
<i>Because we are...
we're fully booked today.</i>

14:11.419 --> 14:14.002
<i>Perhaps you'd like to come
back at another time?</i>

14:19.034 --> 14:20.523
Holy crap!

14:21.915 --> 14:23.739
- Anton!
- Help me pick her up.

14:23.770 --> 14:25.394
Aw, jeez.

14:25.819 --> 14:27.802
Come on, go.

14:33.723 --> 14:35.291
<i>Need to see some ID.</i>

14:36.282 --> 14:37.722
<i>Thanks.</i>

14:37.753 --> 14:38.546
Yep.

14:41.498 --> 14:43.387
Don't you ever go home, mate?

14:43.419 --> 14:44.508
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

14:44.539 --> 14:47.291
Never. What's up, fellas?

14:49.113 --> 14:50.105
You boys hear about Dickson?

14:50.138 --> 14:51.291
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:51.322 --> 14:52.954
They did the same to that Wells kid.

14:52.987 --> 14:54.139
Freaking subbies.

14:54.171 --> 14:56.475
Should just take them all out
in the desert and shoot them.

14:56.506 --> 14:57.916
- That's right.
- Earning your paycheck, boys?

14:57.947 --> 14:59.058
ID.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.499
We're doing things
the hard way today, are we?

15:06.201 --> 15:07.328
Why does he do it?

15:07.995 --> 15:10.267
Your husband...
protecting those subbies.

15:10.298 --> 15:12.411
Why don't you ask him?

15:12.443 --> 15:13.948
You know, they killed a guard.

15:16.027 --> 15:17.019
When?

15:17.050 --> 15:18.715
Three of them broke out
the containment center.

15:18.747 --> 15:21.248
Ripped the guard's heart
right out his chest.

15:21.626 --> 15:23.675
Subbies are freaking animals.

15:23.707 --> 15:26.268
They used to say that
about my people, too.

15:29.467 --> 15:31.450
Waruu, call me.

15:31.482 --> 15:33.211
Don't make me worry.

15:49.851 --> 15:52.475
Oh, um, could somebody hold him?

15:52.507 --> 15:54.876
It's okay. You're going to be all right.

15:54.906 --> 15:56.058
Easy, Djukara.

15:56.090 --> 15:58.779
Nearly done. Just try and relax.

16:00.186 --> 16:01.755
Keep breathing deep.

16:06.523 --> 16:08.013
What's going on, Waruu?

16:08.506 --> 16:09.947
We'll talk outside.

16:20.701 --> 16:22.014
It's all over the news.

16:22.726 --> 16:23.837
What are they saying?

16:24.731 --> 16:27.580
Dead guard, no heart.

16:28.827 --> 16:30.459
What?

16:30.715 --> 16:32.955
CA find this mob here,
we're freaking gone.

16:32.986 --> 16:34.714
They're not going to find them.

16:34.747 --> 16:37.242
You crazy? You're trying
to get us all killed.

16:37.274 --> 16:38.523
They didn't murder anyone.

16:41.018 --> 16:42.331
I was there.

16:44.826 --> 16:46.640
I don't know about any of that shit.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.155
They don't belong here.

16:48.187 --> 16:49.627
We're going to look after them.

16:51.770 --> 16:54.140
What do you want me to do,
hand them over to the CA?

16:56.089 --> 16:57.594
Just get them to the gym. Harry can't.

16:57.626 --> 16:59.515
- I need your help, Uncle.
- No, no, no.

16:59.546 --> 17:01.212
Get those pricks out of my sight.

17:01.242 --> 17:02.704
They're just kids!

17:03.656 --> 17:05.928
No different than Jake or Gub.

17:06.928 --> 17:08.282
We can't buy into any of this.

17:08.314 --> 17:10.444
It is bullshit.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.619
They want us to tear each other apart.

17:17.146 --> 17:18.844
Look.

17:22.299 --> 17:23.611
Let their own kind look after them.

17:23.641 --> 17:26.521
No, I want them away from
Maliyan, under my care.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.291
Please, please. Let me go.

17:51.322 --> 17:54.363
Please! Please, let me go.

17:54.394 --> 17:55.388
You're not going anywhere.

17:55.418 --> 17:57.178
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the hotline.

17:57.211 --> 18:00.251
Hey, let's think first
before we call the CA.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.755
We have a gold mine right here.

18:33.307 --> 18:36.283
<i>People are paying a
fortune for subbie hair.</i>

19:13.178 --> 19:14.715
<i>Put some more weights on that rack.</i>

19:26.234 --> 19:27.099
Here.

19:31.482 --> 19:33.307
Are you going to walk around in that?

19:34.809 --> 19:36.249
We have to get back to Djukara.

19:36.282 --> 19:38.033
There's some mattresses over there.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.180
<i>How many Hairy
brothers living in the Zone?</i>

19:41.978 --> 19:43.278
<i>Quite a mob.</i>

19:43.546 --> 19:45.275
Well, shouldn't we hang out with them?

19:47.258 --> 19:48.507
Not a good idea.

19:52.026 --> 19:53.621
Lot of heat on you boys.

19:54.043 --> 19:55.834
Safer for you here.

20:05.243 --> 20:08.379
Cool. What else you got?

20:08.409 --> 20:09.722
<i>You got any food?</i>

20:23.162 --> 20:27.099
500. Nice.

20:27.130 --> 20:28.891
1,000.

20:30.137 --> 20:31.482
Come on. 1,500.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.570
<i>Oh, my God, that's so much money.</i>

20:36.601 --> 20:38.106
<i>Two grand.</i>

20:40.602 --> 20:42.011
<i>Two and a half.</i>

20:44.826 --> 20:45.978
Come on.

20:49.881 --> 20:51.225
<i>Nice one.</i>

20:51.258 --> 20:54.395
At 35.

21:02.426 --> 21:05.049
Keep looking. I want that Hairy found.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.322
<i>I found something.</i>

21:11.354 --> 21:13.179
<i>We can trace the IP.</i>

21:20.891 --> 21:22.114
Hello, pet.

21:23.705 --> 21:24.825
I don't think we got the chance

21:24.857 --> 21:27.032
to introduce ourselves, did we?

21:27.674 --> 21:29.339
I'm Frankie.

21:31.162 --> 21:32.443
Not hungry?

21:34.970 --> 21:37.755
<i>You've had a bit of a shock,
haven't you, poor love?</i>

21:45.690 --> 21:47.514
Perhaps you should have a bite to eat.

21:51.258 --> 21:53.371
I need you to be healthy, so please eat.

22:41.729 --> 22:43.777
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Not busy, are you?

22:43.810 --> 22:45.666
<i>Oh, we've got a young one
on the loose in the city.</i>

22:45.696 --> 22:47.857
<i>It's a bloody headache,
but we're closing in.</i>

22:49.281 --> 22:51.714
That freaking idiot Matthews
was in here earlier

22:51.745 --> 22:53.218
throwing his weight around.

22:53.248 --> 22:54.400
<i>Careful, Steve.</i>

22:54.434 --> 22:57.346
<i>That's our elected representative
you're talking about.</i>

22:58.432 --> 23:00.705
<i>Any progress on the break
and entry in the lab?</i>

23:00.737 --> 23:03.778
Facial recognition threw up a Koen West.

23:03.808 --> 23:05.953
- He runs a bar.
- <i>West?</i>

23:05.985 --> 23:07.682
Yeah. They're brothers.

23:07.714 --> 23:09.410
I checked with Births and Deaths.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.489
Well, they're half-brothers,
to be precise.

23:11.521 --> 23:13.571
<i>You want me to go into this
bar, pick this guy up?</i>

23:14.113 --> 23:15.102
Not yet.

23:15.746 --> 23:17.367
I need to think about that.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.225
I might head into the Zone.

23:20.257 --> 23:22.757
I'll need your checkpoint
goons to not kick up a fuss.

23:23.008 --> 23:23.749
<i>You want me in with you?</i>

23:23.944 --> 23:26.194
Sir, it's pretty hairy
in there at the moment.

23:27.296 --> 23:28.282
I'll be fine.

23:45.629 --> 23:47.038
I need to talk to you.

23:50.782 --> 23:52.403
Those kids can't stay here.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.462
Just concentrate on the doctor stuff.

23:54.492 --> 23:55.708
Don't you patronize me.

23:55.741 --> 23:57.214
I just put my clinic
on the line for you.

23:57.245 --> 23:58.525
It's under control.

23:58.556 --> 24:00.376
- They murdered a man.
- They didn't.

24:00.893 --> 24:02.397
Well, that's not what the
authorities are saying,

24:02.429 --> 24:03.388
and they're going to come after them.

24:03.420 --> 24:04.380
And who's going to look after

24:04.412 --> 24:06.237
all these people in the Zone
if they shut it down?

24:06.268 --> 24:08.060
It's a setup by the CA.

24:08.092 --> 24:09.597
Even if it is, it still means

24:09.630 --> 24:10.877
that the clinic could
get dragged into it.

24:10.909 --> 24:11.966
They have to go.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.749
Doc! You need to see this!

24:14.781 --> 24:16.477
Okay, um, hold him.

24:16.509 --> 24:17.566
Hold him, hold him.

24:17.597 --> 24:19.421
We need to flush his blood out.

24:19.452 --> 24:21.180
Alcohol. It's in the cupboard.

24:21.213 --> 24:22.025
Okay.

24:43.485 --> 24:45.533
Freaking shaver bastard.

24:45.565 --> 24:47.263
Just go home, mate.

25:04.540 --> 25:05.506
Oi!

25:07.740 --> 25:09.053
Dude, what the...

25:12.285 --> 25:13.891
Hey! That's enough!

25:14.558 --> 25:15.787
The frig are you?

25:16.665 --> 25:18.092
I said that's enough.

25:19.133 --> 25:20.579
Go on. Get out of here.

25:22.653 --> 25:23.547
Hey.

25:24.701 --> 25:25.739
You all right?

25:26.749 --> 25:28.130
We need to get him to the clinic.

25:28.605 --> 25:30.142
You're all right.
Just keep breathing, mate.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.154
Oh, guys, just hold him. Just hold him.

25:36.061 --> 25:39.005
Jarrod? Jeez. Just wait outside. We...

25:39.036 --> 25:40.381
Eve, help him out, will you?

25:41.917 --> 25:43.133
Anything I can do?

25:43.165 --> 25:45.085
No, it's a transfusion stuff-up.

25:45.117 --> 25:46.621
His whole system's melting down.

25:46.652 --> 25:48.984
We just... we don't know his blood type!

25:49.373 --> 25:50.807
What clan's he from?

25:51.997 --> 25:53.533
Think he's Billamanju.

25:53.566 --> 25:54.877
Who else in the Zone is Billamanju?

25:54.908 --> 25:56.188
Maliyan.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.630
- I'll get him.
- Alinta!

25:59.069 --> 26:00.285
We'll leave.

26:02.973 --> 26:04.190
<i>Just wait.</i>

26:05.308 --> 26:07.100
<i>Wait. It should pass.</i>

26:07.132 --> 26:09.086
Step away! Step away! On the ground!

26:09.116 --> 26:10.537
- Okay.
- On the ground!

26:11.516 --> 26:13.102
- Where's the subbie?
- Through there.

26:13.725 --> 26:15.249
Stay down.

26:22.460 --> 26:24.188
Suspect is still at large.

26:30.109 --> 26:31.370
We are dead.

26:51.036 --> 26:52.648
So, is the hair staying?

26:53.693 --> 26:55.901
- There's so much of it.
- Yes, that's the idea.

26:55.933 --> 26:57.320
That's what they're paying for.

26:57.885 --> 26:59.933
<i>God, my man likes me
waxed within an inch.</i>

26:59.964 --> 27:01.697
That's because he's only got an inch.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.709
<i>So has she got a name yet?</i>

27:03.741 --> 27:05.912
Clients can call her what they like.

27:06.877 --> 27:08.680
My name is Araluen.

27:09.405 --> 27:11.360
We don't use our real names around here.

27:12.925 --> 27:14.352
Good. Introduction's over.

27:19.964 --> 27:22.440
We're all friends now, aren't we, pet?

27:24.412 --> 27:26.365
Scoot. That one. Thank you.

27:28.284 --> 27:31.454
- Pulse is steady.
<i>- BP normal.</i>

27:31.484 --> 27:32.927
So far, so good.

27:35.068 --> 27:36.428
You're a lifesaver.

27:36.903 --> 27:37.641
Thanks.

27:38.492 --> 27:40.000
I didn't do it for you.

27:42.658 --> 27:43.551
And thank you.

27:45.117 --> 27:47.069
I'm just going to check
that kid outside.

27:47.101 --> 27:48.723
- You okay?
- Yep.

27:59.069 --> 28:00.477
Ooh, sorry.

28:00.509 --> 28:01.918
Nearly done.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.187
With any luck, you'll have a scar.

28:07.709 --> 28:09.822
Girls love that.

28:31.164 --> 28:32.593
You hear me.

28:34.652 --> 28:36.863
Not a word to anyone
about what happened.

28:39.293 --> 28:40.349
Yeah?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.213
He's awake.

28:51.068 --> 28:52.477
We need to send a clear message

28:52.509 --> 28:54.844
that kind of behavior
won't be tolerated.

28:54.876 --> 28:56.022
Will do.

28:56.988 --> 28:58.493
How you going in there?

28:58.524 --> 29:00.669
<i>Illuminating. I've got to go.</i>

29:03.005 --> 29:05.030
Impressive call you made about his clan.

29:05.565 --> 29:06.910
Where'd you get that?

29:07.485 --> 29:09.533
I'm just interested in
a lot of different things...

29:09.564 --> 29:14.141
new, old, ancient, spiritual things.

29:14.173 --> 29:15.964
Things that aren't any of your business.

29:15.997 --> 29:18.445
It's lucky for that kid I'm
a nosy bastard, isn't it?

29:19.004 --> 29:21.820
- You knew my uncle.
- I did, through the arts scene.

29:21.853 --> 29:22.870
I'm a collector.

29:23.133 --> 29:24.269
Jimmy had a good eye.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.311
Rubbish.

29:25.789 --> 29:26.908
Jimmy wouldn't know a dot painting

29:26.940 --> 29:28.191
from a Rembrandt.

29:28.733 --> 29:30.173
Why were you at his funeral?

29:30.455 --> 29:32.445
- I was a friend.
- Never mentioned you.

29:32.477 --> 29:34.494
- Maybe you weren't listening.
- Go to hell.

29:36.125 --> 29:38.397
Uncle Jimmy was the closest
thing I had to a father.

29:38.428 --> 29:41.085
You people thought
he was a drunken old fool,

29:41.117 --> 29:44.317
but I took care of him
and he opened up to me,

29:44.348 --> 29:46.072
shared things with me.

29:46.876 --> 29:47.933
We learned together.

29:47.964 --> 29:49.117
Wasn't his place to do that.

29:49.149 --> 29:50.524
Jimmy thought it was.

29:50.557 --> 29:51.902
This is not yours to play with.

29:51.933 --> 29:54.238
It's not a game. You're a smart man.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.675
Be smart.

29:57.084 --> 29:58.716
You think what it might mean

29:58.749 --> 30:00.987
to combine ancient teachings

30:01.533 --> 30:03.443
with knowledge of the future.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.808
And then? Do what with it?

30:07.964 --> 30:09.821
What the hell did you
and Jimmy do together?

30:11.549 --> 30:14.300
Things I would never
have dreamed were possible.

30:18.269 --> 30:20.315
I know you think Jimmy was special,

30:21.053 --> 30:23.165
but I wouldn't trust
everything he gave you.

30:25.403 --> 30:27.868
He chose the wrong Cleverman, didn't he?

30:56.156 --> 30:57.661
Why'd your uncle give you that club?

30:59.611 --> 31:01.052
<i>It's all connected, isn't it?</i>

31:03.580 --> 31:05.750
It was meant to be my brother Waruu.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.735
There's been some cosmic
stuff-up in the universe.

31:10.236 --> 31:13.406
I mean, he's been training to become
the Cleverman ever since he was two.

31:13.436 --> 31:14.815
Cleverman?

31:17.116 --> 31:18.584
Is that why you can do stuff?

31:19.997 --> 31:20.959
I mean...

31:21.719 --> 31:23.318
you can heal.

31:23.805 --> 31:25.479
You can see things.

31:32.477 --> 31:34.109
You lied when you said you saw nothing

31:34.140 --> 31:35.618
the other day, didn't you?

31:37.437 --> 31:38.978
You saw something then.

31:39.931 --> 31:41.995
And you saw something
again this morning.

31:43.357 --> 31:44.925
What did you see?

31:51.855 --> 31:53.532
You're seeing shit about me.

31:53.565 --> 31:54.756
What is it?

32:26.011 --> 32:29.980
I hear a sound... some kind of alarm.

32:32.828 --> 32:34.045
I see the bar.

32:36.637 --> 32:37.821
I see you.

32:43.164 --> 32:44.167
I see blood.

32:54.844 --> 32:56.050
Maybe you're right.

32:56.827 --> 32:58.876
Maybe they did get the wrong guy.

33:22.548 --> 33:24.026
<i>Chin up, pet.</i>

33:25.203 --> 33:26.571
<i>Yes.</i>

33:28.500 --> 33:31.125
Oh, that's lovely. What do you think?

33:35.059 --> 33:36.148
Real?

33:36.179 --> 33:38.043
<i>Every follicle.</i>

33:38.730 --> 33:39.818
Now, look at me.

34:17.491 --> 34:20.178
- Hey.
- Aw, you suck.

34:20.210 --> 34:21.427
Shut up. It hurts.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.283
Aw, man, harden up.

34:25.523 --> 34:28.023
- Freaking Hairies. It's all their fault.
- Hey, stop it.

34:28.054 --> 34:29.172
You're better than that.

34:32.147 --> 34:33.425
Your friend's still in there.

34:33.650 --> 34:34.922
You want to see him?

34:45.460 --> 34:48.436
- Hey, man!
- You look good, bruz.

34:50.514 --> 34:52.628
Man, we thought you were gone.

34:54.004 --> 34:55.572
What's with the clean skin?

34:56.980 --> 34:58.381
They made us do it.

34:59.339 --> 35:00.499
Who?

35:00.531 --> 35:02.835
The fellow who busted us out.

35:02.866 --> 35:04.356
He organized everything.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.420
That fellow's my dad.

35:18.675 --> 35:20.532
I'd say you've earned that.

35:20.564 --> 35:21.973
Thanks.

35:29.490 --> 35:31.475
Why did you come into the Zone today?

35:32.562 --> 35:34.067
I came to take you to lunch.

35:35.891 --> 35:37.043
Really?

35:39.828 --> 35:41.332
I'm glad you did, or we would have had

35:41.363 --> 35:43.123
two dead kids on our hands.

35:43.658 --> 35:45.107
I like watching you work.

35:47.635 --> 35:49.179
We make a good team.

35:50.027 --> 35:52.212
Yeah, we do.

36:04.851 --> 36:06.580
My line in the sand...

36:10.644 --> 36:13.524
I never stopped to consider
what it meant for you.

36:14.932 --> 36:17.109
Are you sure you're okay
with that decision?

36:18.258 --> 36:19.698
I mean, really okay?

36:22.808 --> 36:23.924
I'm okay.

36:26.164 --> 36:28.117
You don't need an heir?

36:29.396 --> 36:31.796
I hate a competitor.

36:48.884 --> 36:50.420
I have to duck back to the network.

36:50.451 --> 36:52.340
- I know. I'm sorry. - It's okay.

36:52.371 --> 36:53.843
Can't be helped.

37:12.210 --> 37:14.802
It's called a lemon twist.

37:14.835 --> 37:16.488
Makes the drink look pretty.

37:17.074 --> 37:19.731
<i>It means that we can charge more.</i>

37:19.763 --> 37:20.883
Hey, hey, hey. Stay with me.

37:20.914 --> 37:23.090
Come on. We were getting somewhere.

37:23.464 --> 37:24.498
What do you want?

37:24.530 --> 37:26.739
I'm good for the moment.

37:26.771 --> 37:29.618
I wanted to say how sorry
I am about your uncle.

37:30.259 --> 37:31.777
I was a friend of his.

37:32.530 --> 37:34.035
I'd like to offer my condolences.

37:34.068 --> 37:35.412
You sure you don't want a drink?

37:35.857 --> 37:37.875
You know, you look a lot like him.

37:37.908 --> 37:39.796
Must be the beard. It's a dead giveaway.

37:39.828 --> 37:40.994
It's the eyes.

37:41.810 --> 37:47.192
It's an unusual thing,
heterochromia iridus.

37:47.635 --> 37:48.745
What do you want?

37:49.617 --> 37:50.740
Your uncle's eyes were caused

37:50.771 --> 37:53.554
by something else, though, weren't they?

37:53.586 --> 37:56.627
It's the same reason your
eyes are different colors.

37:58.002 --> 37:59.256
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

37:59.891 --> 38:01.706
Jimmy and I worked together.

38:02.772 --> 38:04.713
He shared his knowledge with me,

38:05.844 --> 38:08.282
and it was very lucrative for him.

38:09.171 --> 38:11.603
I'd like to offer you
the same opportunity.

38:11.634 --> 38:13.331
I've got everything I need right here.

38:13.362 --> 38:14.169
Really?

38:15.762 --> 38:16.962
This bar?

38:20.691 --> 38:22.936
You have worlds at your feet

38:23.571 --> 38:25.236
and you don't even know it.

38:27.411 --> 38:29.683
I didn't catch your name. I'm Koen.

38:30.674 --> 38:32.019
Jarrod Slade.

38:36.786 --> 38:38.515
Maybe a drink another time.

39:15.154 --> 39:17.716
Hey! Oh, it's all right.

39:17.747 --> 39:19.731
I know a back way.
You want to come with me?

39:34.450 --> 39:35.655
Load them up.

39:39.155 --> 39:40.339
- Ready, bruz?
- Yeah, bruz.

39:40.371 --> 39:41.978
Right, set...

39:44.946 --> 39:46.930
Struggling.

39:46.963 --> 39:48.340
<i>I ain't struggling.</i>

39:48.372 --> 39:50.004
Struggling.

39:52.916 --> 39:55.572
All right, you can sleep
up there for tonight.

39:58.067 --> 39:59.603
Latani?

40:04.179 --> 40:05.381
You made it.

40:08.659 --> 40:10.132
You're safe.

40:12.659 --> 40:13.683
Mom?

40:15.922 --> 40:17.267
Dad?

40:19.699 --> 40:21.297
They killed Jyra.

40:23.410 --> 40:24.500
I know.

40:28.114 --> 40:29.755
Why did you attack them?

40:30.259 --> 40:30.963
Huh?

40:33.492 --> 40:36.916
Dad told you to keep your head down.

40:36.946 --> 40:38.803
What did you think would happen?

40:40.211 --> 40:42.315
You were outnumbered
and they were armed.

40:42.739 --> 40:44.051
You blame me?

40:45.419 --> 40:47.275
If you had just listened...

40:49.874 --> 40:52.019
Jyra would still be alive today.

40:52.402 --> 40:55.667
So, what? We outlive them Dad's way?

40:57.651 --> 41:00.500
In case you haven't noticed,
that hasn't been working.

41:19.551 --> 41:20.461
You all right?

41:50.929 --> 41:52.378
Hey, Frankie's happy.

41:53.745 --> 41:54.811
You must have done well.

42:08.242 --> 42:09.938
<i>Remember when they arrested you?</i>

42:09.969 --> 42:11.761
I saw it on the TV.

42:13.937 --> 42:16.075
I'm sorry about what happened
to your little girl.

42:23.441 --> 42:24.735
Do you have children?

42:25.522 --> 42:26.449
Yeah, I got two.

42:26.481 --> 42:28.434
I got a boy that's five

42:28.465 --> 42:30.481
and a little girl, Sophie, six.

42:32.081 --> 42:33.302
Mine was Jyra.

42:35.217 --> 42:36.574
That's a pretty name.

42:44.882 --> 42:46.622
I have other children, too.

42:49.394 --> 42:51.607
Just before you ask, I can't help you.

42:52.690 --> 42:53.815
Please.

42:56.402 --> 42:58.326
I need to be with my family.

43:00.913 --> 43:02.386
Just don't ask me again.

43:36.544 --> 43:38.208
What's going on in there?

44:08.529 --> 44:09.490
<i>...renewed pressure</i>

44:09.522 --> 44:11.394
<i>on the government's
containment policies.</i>

44:11.814 --> 44:13.393
<i>Three subhumans broke out</i>

44:13.425 --> 44:15.634
<i>of protective custody early today,</i>

44:15.666 --> 44:17.650
<i>murdering a containment center guard</i>

44:17.681 --> 44:20.559
<i>in what appears to be emerging
as their trademark attack...</i>

44:21.010 --> 44:24.019
<i>the victim left with his
heart torn from his body.</i>

44:24.049 --> 44:26.866
<i>It brings to date
three confirmed deaths.</i>

44:26.898 --> 44:29.553
<i>There appears to be
no pattern in the attacks,</i>

44:29.585 --> 44:31.281
<i>the victims differing in age
and circumstances.</i>

44:31.313 --> 44:32.583
You old bastard.

44:33.554 --> 44:35.378
What were you wrapped up in, eh?

44:37.170 --> 44:38.770
I got your feed here.

44:39.698 --> 44:41.162
Sorry it's late.

44:42.161 --> 44:43.430
You want to eat it now?

44:47.473 --> 44:48.946
<i>Want a glass of water?</i>

44:52.272 --> 44:55.415
- <i>How are you doing?</i>
- I'm okay.

44:56.112 --> 44:58.513
- What about you?
- Yeah, good.

44:59.921 --> 45:01.535
Pair of liars, aren't we?

45:16.818 --> 45:18.514
I wish you'd get a second opinion.

45:20.241 --> 45:21.250
Nah, it's meant to be.

45:21.665 --> 45:23.054
Can't muck with karma.

45:25.545 --> 45:26.385
I love you.

45:30.406 --> 45:31.968
You're always looking after me.

45:32.497 --> 45:33.952
I appreciate it.

45:35.857 --> 45:37.507
- I'll see you soon.
- Mm-hmm.

45:42.386 --> 45:44.050
Have a feed.

46:11.819 --> 46:13.901
Don't you have a hug for your mum?

46:32.990 --> 46:35.295
I've been calling you all day.

46:41.009 --> 46:42.853
Is there anything I need to know?

47:11.745 --> 47:12.834
Babe.

47:15.281 --> 47:16.162
Hey.

47:18.097 --> 47:18.985
Come on.

47:20.594 --> 47:23.377
<i>Will you please let me in?</i>

47:24.786 --> 47:26.195
<i>I just want to talk.</i>

47:31.120 --> 47:33.617
What am I up against, huh?
