WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:08.276
Yeah, this one is positive.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.478
Which makes 30 positives.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.246
But there was
that one negative.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.714
The negative was
a popsicle stick.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.349
Do you even bother
telling your boyfriend

00:15.383 --> 00:17.718
if there's only, like, a 96%
chance you could be pregnant?

00:17.751 --> 00:20.288
100% chance.
It was a popsicle stick.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.123
I saw you eat the popsicle

00:22.156 --> 00:24.092
and then draw this little
minus sign on it

00:24.125 --> 00:26.227
and then pee on it
for some reason.

00:26.260 --> 00:29.463
It's because I have
crazy pregnancy brain, Neepa!

00:29.497 --> 00:30.831
Oh, God.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.200
I'm really pregnant.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.334
Uh-huh.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.169
I have to tell Danny.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.537
Hey.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.806
Hey, Daddy--
I mean, Danny. Damn it.

00:38.839 --> 00:39.873
[baby crying]

00:39.907 --> 00:42.510
I can't hear you right now.
This baby's crying.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.413
Remind me not to have kids
until I'm old and deaf.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.515
Larry King's got
the right idea.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.750
Mm-hmm, totally.
I love Larry King.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.320
The thing about telling
your Justice Scalia-level

00:52.353 --> 00:54.388
Catholic boyfriend
that you're pregnant is

00:54.422 --> 00:56.324
no time ever feels
like the right one.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.259
Hey, Danny,
do you have a second to--

00:58.292 --> 01:01.295
Whoa, you look hot as hell.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.830
Okay.
All right, relax.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.299
Father Francis is doing his
big sermon on shame today.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.568
If he even suspects that
I'm talking to a girl,

01:07.601 --> 01:09.203
he'll sit me
with the masturbators.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.839
Is there anything you want me
to confess for you?

01:11.872 --> 01:13.874
Nope.
Have a good time at church.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.709
Bye.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.111
(Mindy)
And then it hit me,

01:17.145 --> 01:18.312
I'll come visit him,

01:18.346 --> 01:19.580
plan a romantic
weekend getaway

01:19.613 --> 01:20.681
where after a day
of pretending

01:20.714 --> 01:22.283
to enjoy reading
and fresh air,

01:22.316 --> 01:25.619
I'll tell him that we're
having a little--

01:25.653 --> 01:27.355
Son of a bitch!

01:27.388 --> 01:29.257
Cindy!

01:29.290 --> 01:32.226
Mindy.

[hip-hop music]

01:35.263 --> 01:37.165
*

01:37.198 --> 01:39.633
Great to see you again, Alan,
Little Danny.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.202
Why are you guys in town?

01:41.235 --> 01:43.537
Oh, are you house-sitting for us
while we go away?

01:43.571 --> 01:44.605
That's great.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.439
If you're gonna
do some laundry,

01:45.473 --> 01:46.640
maybe throw
some of mine in there.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.841
But I need you
to look at the tags,

01:47.875 --> 01:49.777
because my clothes
are on the fancier side.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.179
We're not house-sitting.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.381
She got suspended
from school for a week.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.849
Little Danny?
But she's so cute.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.886
I slapped my teacher
in her dumb face.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.789
And then she slapped the
principal, who happens to be,

02:01.822 --> 02:04.758
get this, an Indonesian
transgender woman.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.627
So she gets rewarded with
a free trip to New York City?

02:06.660 --> 02:08.529
When I was suspended
for stalking my teacher,

02:08.562 --> 02:11.232
I was locked in my room
for five days.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.766
Yeah, sure, I escaped,
'cause, I mean,

02:12.800 --> 02:14.702
nothing was gonna keep me
away from Mr. Sherman.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.170
(Alan)
This is no vacation.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.372
I warned her, I said,
"You mess up,

02:18.406 --> 02:19.940
you're gonna have to deal
with Big Danny."

02:19.973 --> 02:21.375
Me, you don't listen to.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.710
You, she respects.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.313
Can I talk to you
for a second?
Yeah.

02:25.346 --> 02:28.816
This thing with
Little Danny is serious.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.285
And I don't think we can
go away this weekend.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.221
No, Danny,
we have to go away.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.689
I have to tell you
something.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.824
I know everything's been weird

02:36.857 --> 02:38.326
since you said you're
moving to Frisco,

02:38.359 --> 02:39.893
but everything's great
between us.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.395
Right now
my family needs me.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.964
Yeah, I get it.
Okay?

02:43.997 --> 02:45.299
It's probably for the best
we're not going anyway.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.767
Don't want to start
another forest fire.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.469
Another forest fire?

02:48.502 --> 02:52.206
Yeah, don't worry
about it.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.674
(Danny)
This is it, Dad.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.376
This is where I work.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.345
Who are these people?
Let me guess.

02:57.378 --> 03:00.814
Your old scout leader and
a little girl robot you built.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.551
Morgan, this is my dad
and my baby sis.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.852
Your dad, huh?

03:04.885 --> 03:06.920
So this is who we have to thank
for a lifetime of grouchiness.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.356
No, no, no.
No, no.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.359
If you hurt this boy again,
I will hurt you.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.860
Morgan.
You son of a bitch.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.295
Morgan, stop.
Morgan, stop.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.863
Welcome, hello.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.698
Little girl,
I like your glasses.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.699
You know, I got
a pair of glasses.

03:18.732 --> 03:19.933
Wanna hear
a great story?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.402
I'm at
the Salvation Army.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.570
They're about
to throw them out.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.905
I grab 'em, I say,
"No way, Jose."

03:24.938 --> 03:27.241
Now I wear 'em
three days a week.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.410
All right, hey, Little D,
check this out.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.712
The kitchen over there,
bottomless toaster pastries.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.247
Oh, there's a bottom,

03:33.281 --> 03:34.715
and it is covered
in rat droppings.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.351
You wanna take a look?
Come on.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.919
Hey, look at this, Pop.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.321
That's my office.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.755
She's okay.
Yeah, it's fine.

03:41.789 --> 03:42.756
[phone vibrating]

03:42.790 --> 03:45.359
Danny...
Yeah, it's allowed.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.528
Annette?
Mindy, hi.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.264
I'm sorry to bother you on
your romantic weekend getaway,

03:50.298 --> 03:53.601
but I looked online
and I'm a little confused

03:53.634 --> 03:54.935
because that place
you're staying,

03:54.968 --> 03:57.037
it only has one bed
per room.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.407
You know what?
We ended up not going.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.742
Did you break up with Danny?

04:01.775 --> 04:04.011
Did Danny break up with you?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.413
No, no.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.881
We didn't go because
of some last-minute

04:07.915 --> 04:09.049
out-of-town visitors.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.451
Okay then, I guess I'll--

04:10.484 --> 04:11.619
It was Alan
and Little Danny.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.786
Damn it,
you're a good detective.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.622
Danny's father's in town?

04:14.655 --> 04:17.625
After walking out on me,
he's back?

04:17.658 --> 04:18.859
I knew I shouldn't
have told you,

04:18.892 --> 04:20.828
but it's not my fault.
I have ADHDTV.

04:20.861 --> 04:21.995
You're mad, huh?

04:22.029 --> 04:25.065
Mindy, no,
I'm not still mad at Alan.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.133
It's water under
the bridge.

04:26.166 --> 04:30.304
In fact, why don't you all
come to dinner tonight?

04:30.338 --> 04:32.072
This isn't one of those dinners
where you guilt everyone, is it?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.407
No.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.075
Guilt dinners
are only for you.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.078
And they may need to stop
'cause it's getting expensive.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.813
I personally would hate
to see the man

04:39.847 --> 04:41.482
who abandoned me
with two small children,

04:41.515 --> 04:43.384
but if you're cool with it,
then fine.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.319
See you at 7:00.
Bring dessert.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.355
Oh, I shouldn't bring dessert.
I'll just eat it in the car.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.056
[dial tone]
Hello?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.759
Hello?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.329
You told Mom we'd bring Dad
and Little Danny

04:55.363 --> 04:56.664
to dinner tonight?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.332
What the hell
is wrong with you?

04:58.366 --> 04:59.066
Why don't you just
invite a lion?

04:59.099 --> 05:00.901
There'd be less carnage.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.436
I spoke to your mom
on the phone.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.472
She seemed really chill
about it.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.106
I think that that wine
of the day club I got her

05:06.139 --> 05:07.841
is really working.
Sit down.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.644
I'm sorry, Danny,
but she seemed really sincere.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.780
Like when she tells me
she hates my makeup.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.914
Fine.
It's okay.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.349
It's just,
please don't come.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.084
This is something
only families should see.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.819
Like when Ma cooks eggs
in her bra.

05:18.852 --> 05:23.357
I'm sorry, you don't
think of me as family?

05:23.391 --> 05:24.825
You don't want me
to come to dinner?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.827
I wouldn't wish that
on my worst enemy, babe.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.796
I gotta go.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.698
Make sure Ma doesn't
poison the gravy.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.103
Hey, Peter.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.405
How's Texas treating you?

05:37.438 --> 05:38.472
It's so great.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.773
The other day I saw
Henry and Lauren

05:39.807 --> 05:40.841
for about an hour or two,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.743
and then they saw me
and I ran away.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.745
You know what, it's only
stalking if it doesn't work.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.080
You make her love you.
Roger that, hoss.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.849
So how's Danny?
Did he make you quit your job

05:48.882 --> 05:50.451
when he found out
you were pregnant?

05:50.484 --> 05:52.720
Actually, Peter,
I haven't told him yet.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.555
He didn't even invite me
to his family dinner tonight.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.056
What?
That's crazy.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.058
Who's more family than you?
You're carrying his child.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.460
Wasn't that the whole point

05:59.493 --> 06:00.961
in tricking him
into getting you pregnant?

06:00.994 --> 06:02.463
For the last time,
I did not trick him

06:02.496 --> 06:04.164
into getting pregnant, Peter!

06:04.197 --> 06:05.599
Now what do I do?

06:05.633 --> 06:07.100
You go to that dinner.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.636
Family doesn't wait
to be invited.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.104
It's like HPV, it just shows up
and never leaves.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.005
You're right, Peter.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.408
I gotta be the human
equivalent of HPV.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.109
Good. All right, I'm gonna
go back to my brisket.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.612
I've actually had two heart
attacks since I've been here.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.080
You need to eat
some fiber, dude.

06:24.618 --> 06:25.986
Stop, stop, stop!
Stop the car!

06:26.019 --> 06:27.120
Stop!
What are you doing?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.689
You can't just
run through the street.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.857
This isn't Calcutta.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.492
I flew 40,000 miles
from San Francisco

06:31.525 --> 06:32.893
because we need
time together.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.528
If there's gonna be a Castellano
family dinner tonight,

06:34.562 --> 06:35.663
I need to come with you.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.097
Okay, get in the car.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.566
Thank you.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.967
Can I run upstairs
and make a mix tape?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.735
Your music sucks.
No! Get in the car.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.604
No NPR, please.

06:43.637 --> 06:44.605
[sighs]

06:44.638 --> 06:46.173
(Mindy)
Hey, guys!

06:50.978 --> 06:52.880
Hey, cool it
with the pie, okay?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.148
Ma's making a special
Italian seafood feast.

06:55.182 --> 06:58.686
No one's excused until she can
comb her hair with the bones.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.521
Sorry, Danny, I just--I've been
craving these apple pies,

07:00.554 --> 07:01.889
and they're only available

07:01.922 --> 07:03.023
in the doctors' lounge
vending machine.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.157
They're from the '80s,

07:04.191 --> 07:08.996
before natural ingredients
completely ruined snacks.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.230
She's passed out.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.165
Unbelievable.

07:12.199 --> 07:16.504
You're like the Dog Whisperer,
Cesar Chavez, only for kids.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.506
How do you think your mom's
gonna react tonight?

07:18.539 --> 07:20.508
Think she'll take off
her earrings?

07:20.541 --> 07:22.776
Whenever my ma was about
to let my dad have it,

07:22.810 --> 07:23.844
she'd take her earrings off.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.246
Now most people think
black women invented that.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.615
Nope, Ma.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.149
Either way, I think
tonight's gonna be

07:29.182 --> 07:31.018
a really warm family affair.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.790
Okay, everybody be cool.
No freaking out.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.191
I feel like
you're freaking out.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.160
No, I'm not.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.996
Okay.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.098
Hello.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.636
Mindy, Danny, welcome.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.003
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.239
The soup kitchen
is just down the road.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.575
Nettie.
It's me, Alan.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.776
Your ex.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.079
Oh, my goodness, Alan!

07:59.112 --> 08:03.050
It's so wonderful to see you
after all these years

08:03.083 --> 08:05.185
you spent baking
in the desert sun.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.219
(Dot)
Well, well, well.

08:06.253 --> 08:10.057
Look what clumped up
at the bottom of the drain.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.058
Hello, Dorothy.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.560
30 years you been gone.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.794
This woman was shattered.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.629
You leave me
to pick up the pieces.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.931
That's why I don't
have a husband.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.100
Yeah, Dot,
that's ancient history.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.669
I've never been happier.

08:21.702 --> 08:25.873
In fact, my cheeks actually
hurt from smiling so much.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.908
Ow!
[laughs]

08:27.941 --> 08:29.276
Come on in.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.712
Dot will take
your coats.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.715
Come in.
Sit anywhere.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.317
Danielle, it's so good
to finally meet you.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.653
You're just gorgeous.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.222
Could you ask first?
I have stranger issues.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.991
Of course.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.026
That's a very normal request.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.061
My apologies.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.130
Don't have to ask me
'cause I love hugs.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.933
Oh, man, I would never
leave you hanging for a hug.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.302
Mom, this is
a wonderful event.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.904
The house smells beautiful.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.071
Looks beautiful.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.973
And you, I don't know
what you're doing.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.309
I'm like, "Ba-ba-ba-boink,"
right?
Thank you.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.977
Thank you for inviting me.
You look very beautiful.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.648
Yes, yes, I found happiness
and life on my own.

09:07.681 --> 09:11.251
My hair turned blonde,
like a princess.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.053
You got brown hair
on Facebook.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.255
Yeah, well,
those photos were taken

09:15.288 --> 09:18.158
before I met
my wonderful boyfriend,

09:18.191 --> 09:21.128
Dr. Robert Ledreau.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.262
Robbie!
Hello.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.230
Oh, you must be Alan.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.331
Put 'er there.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.999
I ain't gonna
shake your pinky.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.835
No, of course not.

09:27.868 --> 09:28.936
Champagne, anyone?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.338
17.99 a bottle.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.007
But that's nothing
on a doctor's salary.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.109
No, thank you.
I'm sober six weeks.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.711
I only drink beer.

09:37.745 --> 09:41.014
Okay, well,
why doesn't Dr. Ledreau

09:41.048 --> 09:45.052
tell the boys all about
his decorated military service

09:45.085 --> 09:47.054
while the girls
go set the table?

09:47.087 --> 09:50.123
Mm-hmm, 'cause in this family,
you gots to do your chores.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.192
(Dot)
Stop saying stupid stuff.
Come help.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.697
Hey, squirt.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.031
Kinda up to my nuts
in plates right now.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.099
You wanna help
with the knives?

09:59.132 --> 10:00.634
My counselor actually says

10:00.668 --> 10:04.071
I'm not supposed
to be around sharp objects.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.839
They might trigger
my emotional problems.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.141
Aww, you poor thing.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.044
Why don't you just go rest
until dinner?

10:11.078 --> 10:13.981
Go lie down in Danny's bed
and watch TV.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.918
Danny, I need your help!

10:17.951 --> 10:20.954
It's time to prepare
"Il sangue delle anguille."

10:20.988 --> 10:22.289
Really? Do we need that
for the feast?

10:22.322 --> 10:24.224
I mean, everyone
just eats the galamar

10:24.257 --> 10:25.893
and the fish-a-sticks,
anyway.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.060
I'll do it.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.328
I love family traditions.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.230
In my family
after Thanksgiving,

10:30.263 --> 10:32.966
I make everyone gather around
while I do a fashion show.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.969
I don't know, I mean, are you
sure you can handle this?

10:36.003 --> 10:38.005
Yeah.
"Il sangria del linguini?"

10:38.038 --> 10:39.106
It sounds delicious.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.375
No, no.
"Il sangue delle anguille."

10:48.982 --> 10:51.885
The blood of the eels.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.121
Whatever happens,
don't fall in.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.989
[laughs]

11:00.260 --> 11:01.829
Look what I found.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.063
Oh, wow.
Eh?

11:03.096 --> 11:04.364
Your old trains.
Yeah.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.199
Ma never let us
touch those.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.335
She'd always turn on
the gas in the oven and say,

11:08.368 --> 11:10.137
"I'll blow us all to bits
before I let something

11:10.170 --> 11:12.973
of your father's
bring you happiness."

11:13.006 --> 11:15.709
I got news for you.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.748
They're yours now.
Mine?

11:20.781 --> 11:22.482
Is that HO Gauge?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.785
HO Gauge?
That's a toy.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.821
This is O Gauge,
a man's model train.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.891
Oh, look at that.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.059
I did it, I did it,
I killed 'em!

11:32.092 --> 11:33.260
In the pot, in the pot.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.997
Whoa, that is a new record.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.066
You sure you're not
a Castellano?

11:39.099 --> 11:41.034
Really?
Me?

11:41.068 --> 11:43.103
A Castellano?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.104
Oh, God, it moved!

11:44.137 --> 11:44.872
It's a reflex.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.740
It might happen
when we're eating.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.279
They don't make 'em
like they used to, Pop.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.514
Danny, what I'm gonna say
may not mean so much

11:54.547 --> 11:56.917
coming from a mope
like me,

11:56.950 --> 11:58.485
but I gotta tell you,
you did great raising Richie

11:58.518 --> 12:00.821
and yourself
after I flew the coop.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.056
Well, thanks, Dad.
That does mean a lot.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.457
I mean, look, you know,
it was hard,

12:04.491 --> 12:06.093
but it made me
who I am.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.227
I'm a lousy father.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.263
And Little Danny's mom is
always off selling turkey legs

12:10.297 --> 12:12.465
at these Renaissance fairs.
She's never home.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.001
You know, when I didn't know
what to do with Richie,

12:14.034 --> 12:16.003
I would sneak out
to the electronics store

12:16.036 --> 12:18.138
and I'd watch Growing Pains
on the TV display.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.841
I learned a lot
from Alan Thicke.

12:20.874 --> 12:21.975
A lot.

12:22.009 --> 12:25.979
What I'm trying to say is
Little Danny deserves better.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.348
And I know in my heart

12:28.381 --> 12:31.985
that you would be a great father
to your little sister.

12:32.019 --> 12:36.023
I'm hoping that maybe you
take her in for a while.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.826
You want me
to take her in?

12:38.859 --> 12:41.161
She deserves better.
You're right.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.362
I would make
a great dad

12:42.395 --> 12:44.998
Little Danny could stay with me
for as long as she needs to.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.033
What?

12:49.202 --> 12:51.038
How could you let your
little sister move in with you

12:51.071 --> 12:52.873
without discussing it
with me first?

12:52.906 --> 12:53.941
We spent three weeks
debating whether or not

12:53.974 --> 12:55.909
we were gonna have a scented
candle in your bathroom,

12:55.943 --> 12:57.477
which, to your credit,
saved our relationship.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.312
You didn't discuss moving
to San Francisco with me.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.547
You just did it.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.149
And you stole all
my good underwear.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.951
I love them!
They fit me like a thong.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.252
Besides, San Francisco
is not the same

13:05.285 --> 13:07.154
as raising
a 12-year-old girl, Danny.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.588
Yeah, you're right,
Little Danny is family.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.858
I'm sorry, blood is thicker
than your Napa chardonnay.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.192
You're getting played.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.127
Girls her age
always have "problems."

13:14.161 --> 13:16.263
When I was 11, I hated
that boys would tease me

13:16.296 --> 13:18.031
because I would read
all the time.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.599
And my parents wouldn't
let me wear makeup.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.334
I was embarrassed,
and I wanted to move

13:21.368 --> 13:22.535
to Lake Buena Vista
and audition

13:22.569 --> 13:24.037
for the all-new
Mickey Mouse Club.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.105
And my mom wasn't like,

13:25.138 --> 13:26.606
"Sure, great plan, Mindy.
Go do that."

13:26.639 --> 13:28.441
She hit me with
an encyclopedia.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.910
And now I'm perfect.

13:29.943 --> 13:30.777
Well, I don't know
if you're--

13:30.810 --> 13:32.612
Oh, sorry, am I
interrupting something?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.047
Yes.
Yeah, kind of.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.182
Well, it's time for dinner,

13:35.215 --> 13:36.483
and Annette wants everyone
to wash up.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.484
Okay.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.618
Specifically you, Mindy

13:38.651 --> 13:41.188
Make me!

13:41.221 --> 13:42.489
[sighs]

13:42.522 --> 13:46.226
Dear Lord, thank you
for this bounty of the sea.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.196
And thank you, Lord,
for bringing us Alan.

13:49.229 --> 13:52.599
Oh, here it comes,
tropical storm Annette.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.201
Though we've had
our differences,

13:54.234 --> 13:56.303
he seems to have
genuinely changed

13:56.336 --> 13:58.939
and to have raised
a beautiful daughter.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.875
Amen.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.945
Okay, my turn.
Rot in hell, you son of a bitch!

14:04.978 --> 14:06.046
Okay, let's eat.
Mange il pesce.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.251
Hey, kiddo.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.922
So, Danny, why do you want
to leave So Cal?

14:14.955 --> 14:16.189
Have you seen
the Mayor of Los Angeles?

14:16.223 --> 14:17.357
He's hot as hell.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.392
I'm in a very dark place
right now.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.560
You know,
when I was your age,

14:20.593 --> 14:21.594
I was also
in a dark place.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.996
It's because
I hated gym class.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.397
My thighs
would rub together,

14:24.431 --> 14:26.266
and the sound was like
a squeaking balloon.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.267
I hate gym too.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.601
So what I ended up doing

14:28.635 --> 14:30.670
was drawing a pentagram
on my forehead

14:30.703 --> 14:33.173
and then they let me
go watch TV with the nurse.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.574
No way!
That worked?
Yeah, it worked.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.377
It worked real good.
You know why?
Why?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.046
'Cause I was a good
little faker like you.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.180
Excuse me?

14:40.213 --> 14:41.414
I was cyber-bullied
for being tall,

14:41.448 --> 14:42.950
and now I have
emotional problems.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.284
Yeah, and I got out of chorus

14:44.317 --> 14:45.618
because of my
uncontrollable farting.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.619
Whatever.

14:46.653 --> 14:47.587
Give me that phone.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.656
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

14:49.689 --> 14:51.658
Your little sister has learned
the age-old tactic

14:51.691 --> 14:53.393
of acting like a psycho
to get what she wants.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.694
I know that because
I invented that.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.296
Okay, Mindy, stop it.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.630
I'm not gonna stop
until your little sister

14:57.664 --> 14:58.798
tells us what she wants.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.467
And if not, I hope she has
a lot of underwater minutes.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.601
Okay, fine!

15:01.634 --> 15:03.636
I slapped my teacher because
I hate living in the desert,

15:03.670 --> 15:05.939
and I hate that my dad's
2,000 years old,

15:05.973 --> 15:07.674
and he yells
at the newspaper.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.443
And I hate that my TV
only gets 50 channels.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.980
It's not fair!

15:13.013 --> 15:15.148
So I guess what we have

15:15.182 --> 15:18.618
is a normal teenager
acting out,

15:18.651 --> 15:20.587
making a lot of drama
to get what she wants.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.289
I hate you!
You're a bitch!

15:22.322 --> 15:24.457
Ow!
Oh!

15:24.491 --> 15:27.594
Oh, my God,
you do not slap a slapper.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.595
Ow!
Whoa!

15:28.628 --> 15:29.662
Okay, that's it.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.064
That's it.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.665
I'm talking to you.
What?

15:32.699 --> 15:33.533
Get up.
Oh, don't step to me.

15:33.566 --> 15:34.968
I just murdered
a bunch of eels tonight.

15:35.002 --> 15:35.969
Okay, let's go.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.170
What are you doing?

15:37.204 --> 15:38.338
She slapped me first.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.572
That's no excuse.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.308
Ethnic people slap each other
all the time.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.642
It's, like, half
of reality television.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.444
Also, let's not forget,
I was right.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.678
Little Danny was lying.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.280
Okay, I don't think that's
gonna be the takeaway

15:47.314 --> 15:48.481
from the dinner.

15:48.515 --> 15:51.418
Okay, well,
if I am so horrible,

15:51.451 --> 15:53.053
maybe I should just go.

15:53.086 --> 15:56.289
Yeah, just out in the night
into the cold,

15:56.323 --> 15:59.259
armed with nothing but
my pepper spray and my gun.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.528
You know what,
maybe that's a good idea.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.696
I mean, look,
this is a family matter,

16:03.730 --> 16:06.233
and we gotta
figure it out, so...

16:18.111 --> 16:20.480
Okay, everybody,
Mindy had to leave.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.383
So let's just enjoy
this nice fish meal

16:23.416 --> 16:24.451
and talk about something
more pleasant.

16:24.484 --> 16:29.222
Son, I know that Little Danny
has said some things.

16:29.256 --> 16:32.159
But I still feel
that our agreement

16:32.192 --> 16:34.527
is gonna provide her
with the best situation

16:34.561 --> 16:36.496
for her to thrive.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.432
Wait a minute.
What agreement?

16:39.466 --> 16:41.668
Danny said that I could come
live with him in New York.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.738
You said that Little Danny
could come live with you?

16:45.772 --> 16:47.574
And Mindy slapped her?

16:47.607 --> 16:50.177
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.411
Where you going?

16:51.444 --> 16:52.545
Ma?

16:52.579 --> 16:53.580
Ma!
[door shuts]

16:56.616 --> 16:58.551
Yes, hi. How much
to go to San Francisco?

16:58.585 --> 16:59.652
Mindy, wait!

16:59.686 --> 17:02.455
Oh, God.
Hold on one second, sir.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.791
Okay, you caught me.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.394
I took your candlestick.
I was just borrowing it.

17:07.427 --> 17:08.495
What the hell?

17:08.528 --> 17:11.398
No, listen,
when Richie was 15,

17:11.431 --> 17:13.766
I wouldn't let him go live
with Bret Easton Ellis.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.302
So he threatened
to throw himself

17:15.335 --> 17:16.636
off the Empire State Building.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.538
I said, "Good.
Here's ten bucks.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.308
Enjoy the view.
Bring me back a T-shirt."

17:21.341 --> 17:23.610
Annette, as much as
I love hearing

17:23.643 --> 17:26.246
the origin stories
of gay men, I gotta go.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.580
I'm sorry for
ruining your dinner.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.749
No, Mindy,
you didn't ruin it.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.085
You weren't exactly
Grace Kelly,

17:32.119 --> 17:35.155
but when a kid's a brat,
you take 'em down.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.225
Now, please,
come back inside.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.227
You don't even
have your coat.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.095
Annette, I can't.

17:42.129 --> 17:46.133
I'm so mad that Danny
didn't have my back in there.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.267
And I'm the one
that's just, like,

17:47.300 --> 17:48.768
sitting here,
sweating, so hot.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.271
How can you be hot?
It's 20 degrees out.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.339
I'm from Boston.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.640
This is, like,
topless weather for me.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.542
Wait a minute.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.610
You aren't drinking.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.579
And when you hugged me,

17:59.612 --> 18:01.448
you were bigger
than usual.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.882
My breasts
have always been huge!

18:02.915 --> 18:05.652
Mindy...

18:05.685 --> 18:06.653
are you pregnant?

18:06.686 --> 18:08.288
Uh, I don't think so, ma'am.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.890
You're sweating because our
hot little Castellano babies

18:10.923 --> 18:13.693
are like an angry furnace
in your stomach.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.328
They are?
Yes.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.563
It feels like I've swallowed
a space heater.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.564
It's agony.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.898
Oh, honey.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.135
Oh, this is the best part.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.737
It's gonna be
so awful for you.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.674
But I'm thrilled.
I'm gonna be a grandma!

18:27.707 --> 18:29.209
Oh, my God.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.644
Listen, I gotta go nail
some stugots to the cross,

18:31.678 --> 18:34.647
and I do not want
my grandson to see this.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.783
I'm gonna be a grandma.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.518
Should I just stand here?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.220
'Cause that was
the only cab I could find,

18:40.253 --> 18:43.490
and I have, like,
a negative seven on Uber.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.658
You know, Robert, I never
would have pictured Annette

18:45.692 --> 18:46.759
with a lady doctor.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.463
Her taste used to run more
towards motorcycle bad boys.

18:50.497 --> 18:51.831
(Dot)
Robert served in Vietnam,

18:51.864 --> 18:54.701
while you cut your pinky toe off
for the draft board.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.304
It was a lawnmower accident.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.371
Everybody, shut up.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.940
All I wanted
was a nice classy dinner

19:00.973 --> 19:04.544
to show off that I finally
have things pretty good.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.714
But I guess I forgot
that even after 30 years

19:07.747 --> 19:10.217
garbage still stinks.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.618
The garbage is you.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.785
Uh-oh.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.488
Mm-hmm.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.556
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.325
You miserable S.O.B.

19:18.358 --> 19:21.794
You left your son
to raise your other son,

19:21.828 --> 19:25.498
and now you're trying to make
him raise your daughter too!

19:25.532 --> 19:27.567
Ma, relax, it's the best thing
for the family.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.602
I haven't even gotten
to you yet.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.205
Do you have
Stockholm Syndrome?

19:32.239 --> 19:34.607
You just love raising
your brothers and your sisters.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.476
And now you kicked
your girlfriend

19:36.509 --> 19:39.379
and your unborn child
out of the house?

19:39.412 --> 19:40.980
What?
What are you talking about?

19:41.013 --> 19:43.216
You don't know?

19:43.250 --> 19:44.317
Castellano men.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.686
Shoot first,
ask questions never.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.655
She's pregnant!

It's Mindy, leave a message.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.670

Mindy, where are you?
I need to see you.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.313
Hmm?

20:46.346 --> 20:48.315
Hey, hey.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.616
Why didn't you tell me?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.651
I tried to tell you.
I just--

20:51.684 --> 20:53.386
There never seemed
to be a good time.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.054
And I know you're mad,

20:55.087 --> 20:56.589
but it's okay, Danny.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.491
I can raise this baby
by myself.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.294
My little brother and I, we had
a parakeet when I was little,

21:01.328 --> 21:02.695
and it died
after three months,

21:02.729 --> 21:04.063
but they were
three good months.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.698
And I loved
that parakeet and--

We're a family.
