00:01.469 --> 00:05.106
ADULT ADAM: Ah, the '80s,
the golden age
of TV theme songs.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.908
Seemed like every show
had a tune you couldn't
get out of your head,

00:07.941 --> 00:10.311
but the catchiest
was The Golden Girls,

00:10.344 --> 00:13.714
a show about four
saucy seniors enjoying
their twilight years.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.150
When they came on,
you couldn't help
but sing along.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.986
* Thank you
for being a friend

00:20.421 --> 00:23.191
* Traveled down the road
and back again

00:24.292 --> 00:26.127
* Your heart is true

00:26.160 --> 00:29.930
* You're a pal
and a confidant

00:29.963 --> 00:31.065
* Boom boom boom

00:31.099 --> 00:34.568
* And if you threw a party

00:34.602 --> 00:39.507
* And invited
everyone you knew

00:39.540 --> 00:43.344
* You would see
the biggest gift
would be from me

00:43.377 --> 00:46.480
* And the card attached
would say

00:46.514 --> 00:48.782
* "Thank you
for being a friend" *

00:48.816 --> 00:51.085
Good song, great ladies.

00:51.885 --> 00:52.986
Oh, Blanche!

00:56.224 --> 00:57.691
* I'm twisted up inside

00:57.725 --> 01:00.928
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

01:03.831 --> 01:05.099
* I don't know the future

01:05.133 --> 01:08.035
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

01:09.637 --> 01:11.905
ADULT ADAM: It was January 3,
1980-something

01:11.939 --> 01:14.108
and winter break
was going great for Erica.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.776
She was sleeping in,
chilling out,

01:15.809 --> 01:18.479
and still falling for her
boyfriend, Geoff. Hard.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.550
What the hell?
Ugh!

01:22.583 --> 01:23.784
Good morning,
clumsy pants!

01:24.652 --> 01:26.520
What... The hell?

01:26.554 --> 01:28.088
It's day 27
of our winter break.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.657
I wanted to surprise you
with something special.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.792
How did you even get in here?
Love finds a way.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.794
Also there's a basement window
that doesn't lock.

01:33.827 --> 01:37.097
Dude, you've done something
special every single day!

01:37.131 --> 01:39.167
Aw, you noticed!
Oh, I've noticed.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.934
The flowers,
the mix tapes,

01:40.968 --> 01:43.337
the Mariachi band
that was really nice at first

01:43.371 --> 01:44.805
and then they overstayed
their welcome.

01:44.838 --> 01:47.141
Okay, well, did you ever
think that I do all this
to compensate

01:47.175 --> 01:49.177
for what you do,
which is nothing.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.645
I'm on winter break!
I'm supposed to do nothing!

01:51.679 --> 01:52.880
I'm just saying,
it would be nice

01:52.913 --> 01:54.415
if you went all out
for me once in a while.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.250
Where are my rose petals
and Mariachis

01:56.284 --> 01:57.685
who play three songs
too many?

01:57.718 --> 02:00.788
Look, you know that
I love you and stuff,
so what more do you need?

02:00.821 --> 02:02.022
White horses.
What?

02:02.055 --> 02:03.123
White horses...
What?

02:03.157 --> 02:05.092
White horses?
Get them, try it.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.195
Okay, I don't know
what you're saying,
but don't count on it.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.268
Why the hell are my stairs
covered in garbage?

02:14.302 --> 02:15.803
That was all Geoff.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.606
Yeah, he threw a bunch of
wildly dangerous rose petals
all over the place.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.740
Which I adore!

02:19.773 --> 02:22.176
This isn't a damn
botanical garden.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.411
Go get a broom,
Schwartz.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.878
I see where
you get it from.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.614
**

02:27.615 --> 02:29.250
Is he going to go
get a broom or what?

02:29.283 --> 02:31.819
ADULT ADAM: While Erica turned
a cold shoulder to love,

02:31.852 --> 02:35.456
my mom was warming her heart
with her favorite TV gal pals.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.225
Shmoops.
The Golden Girls are on.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.626
Come sit.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.595
We'll watch and picture
how we'll spend
our golden years together.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.264
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:43.297 --> 02:46.934
Do you actually think
you and I are going to share
a house when we're old?

02:46.967 --> 02:49.437
No.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.772
Barry and Erica
will be there, too.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.073
Oh, balls!

02:53.106 --> 02:55.409
We need to find you
three nice ladies
to keep you occupied.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.977
Adam,
stop with the panicking.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.346
I've got plenty
of friends.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.315
Let's make a specific list
so we're all on the same page.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.217
Oh, I got it.
Virginia Kremp.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.518
Good.
Just name two more.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.686
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.256
Oh, there's my friend
from Jazzercise. Um...

03:08.289 --> 03:09.323
She sounds incredible!

03:09.357 --> 03:11.492
She's got the headband
and the thingy...

03:11.525 --> 03:13.394
Definitely lifelong friend
material!

03:13.427 --> 03:14.462
What is her name?

03:14.495 --> 03:16.230
We don't need names!
Just like lifelong friend.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.566
Essie Karp! That's it.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.634
Wow, I really
lost touch with her.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.736
Oh, focus on
the positive.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.472
All we need is one more.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.007
This will be part of the
big Bevolution, then.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.710
I need to find a life outside
of my little snuggle bugs.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.011
Looking for a posse, eh?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.413
You've come
to the right place.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.782
Yes! Barry's rudely butting in
like he always does.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.250
It's your lucky day,

03:36.284 --> 03:39.753
'cause I happen to command
the greatest friend group
ever assembled...

03:39.787 --> 03:40.888
The JTP!

03:40.921 --> 03:42.823
ALL: JTP!
BEVERLY: Oh, that's fun.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.224
You say
three letters to them

03:44.258 --> 03:46.260
and they always
scream them back at you.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.696
And with my help,
you can have that, too.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.898
All you got to do is make sure
you pick friends

03:50.931 --> 03:52.900
that have a specific role
in the group.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.202
Ooh,
like my beloved Golden Girls.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.405
Yes, for instance,
I'm the Dorothy,

03:57.438 --> 03:59.973
the strong, masculine leader
who keeps everyone in line.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.209
Oh, you are my handsome
Bea Arthur.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.112
And Andy here is our Sophia,
the tiny, adorable spitfire.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.179
No filter, yo.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.215
Naturally, Naked Rob
is our Blanche...

04:08.248 --> 04:10.217
The sensual one,
free with his body.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.486
My parents got me someone to
talk to once a week about it.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.355
And Matt Bradley here
is our Rose,

04:14.388 --> 04:16.490
dumb as rocks and always
messing everything up.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.025
I just treasure
these friendships.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.260
Ah! Brain freeze! Hurry!

04:20.294 --> 04:22.129
I need my best friends
to rub my head.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.797
Oh, yes. Ahh.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.733
This is what I want!

04:25.766 --> 04:27.535
ADULT ADAM:
As Barry was feeling the love,

04:27.568 --> 04:29.803
I was going to show
my girlfriend just how
much I loved her.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.004
What are you two doing?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.172
Your brother's
such a dork.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.708
I surprised Jackie
by writing romantic lyrics

04:34.742 --> 04:36.977
to music from her favorite
sci-fi movies.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.179
(ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA
PLAYS)
* You

04:39.212 --> 04:41.549
* Are

04:41.582 --> 04:44.352
* So

04:44.385 --> 04:46.887
* Pretty

04:46.920 --> 04:49.089
* And nice and cool
and smart

04:49.122 --> 04:51.592
* And funny and strong
and pretty *

04:51.625 --> 04:54.395
Dude, that is so stupid.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.829
And yet so adorable.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.798
Burn!

04:57.831 --> 04:59.667
Wait, are you being serious?
Don't mind her.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.935
Her heart is a dusty cavern,
void of romance.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.171
Wait a second,
you're dad's kid, too.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.507
So how did you not inherit
his crappy outlook on love?

05:06.540 --> 05:10.177
'Cause I've chosen other,
way better paternal
role models,

05:10.210 --> 05:11.311
like John Hughes.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.714
The reclusive billionaire
who saved his bodily fluids?

05:13.747 --> 05:14.948
No! That's Howard Hughes.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.216
I'm talking about
the filmmaker

05:16.249 --> 05:17.851
who makes romantic
teen movies.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.487
That's who I model
my life after.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.689
Like, on my birthday,
Adam brought me a cake

05:21.722 --> 05:23.691
and we sat on the dining room
table to eat it together.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.825
Sixteen Candles.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.894
And on Valentine's Day,
he painted

05:26.927 --> 05:28.529
this amazing portrait
of me.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.663
Some Kind of Wonderful.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.099
And on our anniversary,
he showed up
on a lawnmower

05:32.132 --> 05:33.934
and we rode off
into the sunset together.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.168
Can't Buy Me Love.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.005
Not a Hughes flick,
but clearly influenced
by the master.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.808
So, what? I ride Geoff
around on a mower

05:40.841 --> 05:42.743
and he stops being lame
for a few minutes?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.678
Kind of missing the point,
but yes.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.448
Dad,
I need your stupid mower!

05:47.481 --> 05:49.116
Now you want
to mow the grass?

05:49.149 --> 05:51.552
It's the middle of winter!
It's about to snow!

05:51.585 --> 05:53.086
It has nothing to do
with mowing!

05:53.120 --> 05:54.988
Then why do you need it?
It's a whole freaking thing!

05:55.022 --> 05:56.323
Just stop asking questions!

05:56.356 --> 05:57.791
Oh, I'll ask questions,
all right!

05:57.825 --> 05:59.192
Damn it, I'm in college!

05:59.226 --> 06:01.995
I shouldn't even
have to ask to use the stupid
gardening equipment!

06:02.029 --> 06:03.697
When I'm done
soaking this toe,

06:03.731 --> 06:05.132
I'm going to go in the garage,

06:05.165 --> 06:07.267
and so help me, if that
lawnmower's missing,

06:07.300 --> 06:09.236
it's curtains for you!
Curtains!

06:09.269 --> 06:12.406
Well, good luck catching me
with that swollen Cheeto toe!

06:12.440 --> 06:14.642
Thanks for the love help.
This is gonna go great.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.009
Curtains!

06:16.043 --> 06:18.812
ADULT ADAM: As my dad
was trying to stop
Erica's romantic plan,

06:18.846 --> 06:21.114
my mom was trying to start
some lifelong friendships.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.150
Ginzy! Over here!

06:23.183 --> 06:26.219
Hey! Haven't seen you
at the PTA in a while.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.321
Oh, I know,
I've been so busy,

06:28.355 --> 06:30.257
and also I was banned
for complaining

06:30.290 --> 06:32.259
about the crappy sangria
last time.

06:32.292 --> 06:36.029
But here I am,
and everyone's too afraid
to say anything to my face!

06:36.063 --> 06:37.197
Well, we could certainly
use your help.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.032
We have a huge
agenda tonight.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.734
Winter formal planning,
fundraising...

06:40.768 --> 06:43.437
Creating a tight-knit group of
friends so we don't die alone.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.772
Think about it, Ginzy.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.540
You and me,
living it up

06:46.574 --> 06:48.942
in a Miami bungalow
like sisters.

06:48.976 --> 06:52.145
Um, I kind of have
actual sisters
that I can live with.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.482
Well, your sisters can
themselves.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.716
I'm sorry, but they can.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.950
Okay.
Look at me, Ginzy.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.085
I'd rather not.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.152
Look at me right now.
Mmm-hmm.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.723
It's you and me
until the day you die.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.493
Okay, okay.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.094
There you go.

07:07.127 --> 07:10.163
We'll be just like
The Golden Girls
and you'll be Sophia!

07:10.197 --> 07:12.032
What?
The grumpy older one?

07:12.065 --> 07:14.067
Exactly!
Just look at your face.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.537
You're totally her,
you goofy old bat.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.138
Settle down, people.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.840
PTA is in session.

07:19.873 --> 07:24.111
First order of business,
we need a group of volunteers
to organize a senior ski trip.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.748
Rick! I'll head up
the senior ski committee.
Virginia Kremp's in, too.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.617
No, I don't even have a kid
in the senior class.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.552
I just need
two more volunteers.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.086
I can help.
No!

07:33.120 --> 07:36.056
Sorry, Ruben Amaro, Sr.
I didn't mean to yell,
but sit down.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.491
But my son
loves that trip.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.127
And we love Ruben Amaro, Jr.,
Ruben Amaro, Sr.,

07:40.160 --> 07:42.262
but this committee
is ladies only.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.598
I don't think
you can do that.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.299
Ooh! Sassy.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.602
I like the cut of your jib,
Essie Karp.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.170
You're in,
you giant floozy.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.505
I don't know how
to reply to that.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.973
And last but not least...

07:53.006 --> 07:55.208
Linda Schwartz,
you're just what I need.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.645
Actually, I'm on
two other committees.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.780
Well, that's on you
for overextending yourself

07:59.813 --> 08:02.315
like a big, dumb airhead.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.518
Every group has one,
am I right?

08:04.552 --> 08:06.620
We're good to go, Rick.
What do you say?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.689
It's weird, Beverly.
It's really weird.

08:08.722 --> 08:12.259
Yay! We're going to be
best friends!

08:12.292 --> 08:14.762
I mean,
a very good committee.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.801
ADULT ADAM: Fearing she was
destined to become an
unromantic loaf like my dad,

08:20.834 --> 08:23.771
Erica embarked on her first
grand romantic gesture.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.574
Thanks to me, she used
the movie Can't Buy Me Love

08:26.607 --> 08:28.375
to mow her way back
into Geoff's heart.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.410
Let's do this!

08:30.443 --> 08:32.546
Turns out,
wasn't as easy as it looked.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.649
Yo, Schwartz!
Open your window!

08:35.683 --> 08:38.018
All that romantic crap
is happening.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.386
Why are you
mowing my lawn?

08:39.419 --> 08:40.453
It's the middle of winter!

08:41.922 --> 08:43.323
ERICA: Damn it!
It's stuck!

08:43.356 --> 08:44.524
Get off my lawn!

08:44.558 --> 08:45.993
Erica?
What are you doing?

08:46.026 --> 08:48.629
This is supposed to be like
that movie Buy Me Some Love.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.863
Can't Buy Me Love?

08:49.897 --> 08:51.699
I thought you said that was
a corny chick movie.

08:51.732 --> 08:52.833
What's the hold up, man?

08:52.866 --> 08:55.703
Just come down here and take
my sweet romance already.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.437
She's not very good at this,
Geoffy.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.841
I know! Doing this stuff
just makes me feel so stupid.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.075
That's the whole point.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.244
You're supposed
to be vulnerable
for the person you love!

09:04.277 --> 09:06.614
Geoff! Come down
and push her out!

09:06.647 --> 09:07.748
It's fine. I got it.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.050
**

09:12.052 --> 09:13.654
Oh, no! No! No! No!

09:14.487 --> 09:16.523
My Peugeot!
Dad's Peugeot!

09:16.556 --> 09:19.559
I am so sorry.
I'll pay to fix it.

09:19.593 --> 09:22.596
You got to order the parts
from France!
It's a whole thing!

09:22.630 --> 09:25.599
God, do you seen what happens
when you guilt me
into being romantic!

09:25.633 --> 09:27.200
Guilt you?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.769
That's not what I meant.

09:28.802 --> 09:32.239
I just wanted to hang
and relax and enjoy
my winter break.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.407
Well, you got two days left.
Enjoy them without me.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.976
What?
There's a senior ski trip.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.110
I think I'll have
a better time there.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.246
But I'm going back
to college.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.948
I won't see you
for months.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.349
Kind of seems like
you need a break.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.719
You could have
just read a poem.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.122
**

09:49.156 --> 09:51.458
Okay, let's review
everything I taught you

09:51.491 --> 09:54.061
about being a bodacious leader
of a friend group.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.228
Rule one.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.898
Always bust balls.
Yes!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.933
Friendship is about
breaking down the walls

09:59.967 --> 10:01.769
to figure out what really
bothers a person.

10:01.802 --> 10:02.870
Rule two?

10:02.903 --> 10:05.472
Pick a badass name
for the group

10:05.505 --> 10:07.675
and yell it
as often as possible

10:07.708 --> 10:10.644
to display a terrifying
show of unity.

10:10.678 --> 10:14.614
I chose the JTP.
Three letters,
but powerful.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.017
Well, I'm looking
for my Golden Girls,

10:17.050 --> 10:20.553
so I chose Goldberg Girls.
Goldberg Girls!

10:20.587 --> 10:24.291
Rule three?
Uh, create opportunities
to bond.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.660
May I suggest
lighting your farts?

10:26.694 --> 10:28.662
It's really brought me
and my friends a lot closer.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.498
I was more thinking we would
bedazzle matching sweaters,

10:31.531 --> 10:33.166
like fashionable
street toughs.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.501
Ah, very lame.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.635
So it's perfect!

10:37.938 --> 10:39.239
There they are!

10:39.272 --> 10:43.410
The fearsome foursome
is back together again.

10:43.443 --> 10:47.114
Come in! Come in,
I made cheesecake. Ha!

10:47.147 --> 10:48.615
I'll dish while we dish.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.051
Actually, I told my husband
that I'd be back by 9:00,

10:51.084 --> 10:52.753
so maybe we should
just jump right in?

10:52.786 --> 10:54.387
I bet you'd like that,
you little hussy.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.089
But sure,
let's get cracking.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.658
Okay, I got everybody
a BeDazzler.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.628
Now, tell me,
what color jewels
should we use?

11:01.661 --> 11:04.164
Jewels?
For our matching sweaters,
you big slut!

11:04.998 --> 11:06.066
Ah...

11:06.099 --> 11:07.768
Bevy, why are you being
so off

11:07.801 --> 11:09.937
Don't listen to her,
she's old and cranky.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.639
Cough up some dust,
why don't you?

11:12.672 --> 11:13.841
What's happening?

11:13.874 --> 11:15.142
Classic Linda.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.511
She's such a clueless dummy,
right, but in a good way!

11:18.545 --> 11:20.247
Okay, why do you
keep calling us names?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.614
I am just busting balls.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.583
That's what we do
in the Goldberg Girls.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.152
That's our cool new name,
by the way.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.520
Goldberg Girls!

11:31.558 --> 11:32.659
We'll get there.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.862
ERICA: So you can buy
someone love

11:34.895 --> 11:36.063
'cause it happened
in this movie,

11:36.096 --> 11:37.530
which is super creepy
and weird.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.200
I mean, she gives up her cool
friends for the gardener?

11:40.233 --> 11:41.634
Okay, this movie sucks.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.070
Yep, there's
no helping her.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.005
Wow, you really are
a closed off Murray.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.640
No! I refuse
to accept that.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.309
Now, give me
another cornball movie

11:49.342 --> 11:51.144
that'll show Geoff
he's my number one fella.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.147
Oh, you know what Adam did
for me that was amazing?

11:54.181 --> 11:56.583
He stood on my front lawn
with a boom box over his head

11:56.616 --> 11:58.485
and played In Your Eyes.
Say Anything.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.153
Wait, I thought that's
how you got Dana.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.522
What?
What?

12:02.555 --> 12:03.924
What?
What's that?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.025
What?
What?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.093
What?
Wha...

12:06.126 --> 12:08.428
Did you recycle
that movie on me?

12:08.461 --> 12:09.897
Pardon?
Wait, I was wrong.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.498
It wasn't
his first love, Dana,

12:11.531 --> 12:13.300
it was you, the new one.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.634
Stop talking.
The better one.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.669
Stop talking.
Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.806
I have a past, too.
Ruben Amaro, Jr.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.074
Yeah, he's going to Stanford
on a baseball scholarship.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.142
I have to go.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.744
My God, lady!

12:24.778 --> 12:27.080
Next time you need help
with love, go somewhere else!

12:27.114 --> 12:28.916
I didn't mean
to drag you down with me!

12:28.949 --> 12:31.051
But you did!
I know! I'm sorry!

12:31.084 --> 12:32.652
Okay,
I can win Jackie back.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.823
Just, uh... Just need some
fresh romantic movie material.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.559
Wait, Short Circuit!
That's romantic.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.693
It's really not.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.162
ADULT ADAM:
And so I called upon

12:42.195 --> 12:44.697
my trusty action figures
for inspiration.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.166
Oh, Weekend at Bernie's!
That's it!

12:46.199 --> 12:47.835
It's not.
Road House.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.036
Eh.
Interspace.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.537
No!
Taxi Driver?

12:50.570 --> 12:51.604
Seriously, no!

12:51.638 --> 12:52.840
Mac and Me?
Stop!

12:52.873 --> 12:54.641
Krull.
I don't even know
what that is!

12:54.674 --> 12:56.977
Halloween!
How many toys
do you have?

12:57.010 --> 12:58.211
Disney's Black Hole?

12:58.245 --> 13:00.347
At least take them
out of the package
and play with them!

13:00.380 --> 13:02.382
Beastie Droids!
That's not even a movie.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.716
Wait, the Highlander!

13:03.750 --> 13:05.819
There's a tiny love story
before all the sword fighting.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.020
Sure, why not.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.490
It's not going to work.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.959
I know.
Buck Rogers?

13:14.828 --> 13:16.463
BEVERLY: Good news, JTP.

13:16.496 --> 13:20.533
The 14-layer dip I made
for the Goldberg Girls
is up for grabs.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.569
What happened?
Linda got whooping cough,

13:22.602 --> 13:25.072
Essie got pink eye,
and Ginzy got both.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.606
Please.
Sounds highly unlikely.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.241
Okay, what are
you implying?

13:28.275 --> 13:29.809
We're not implying,

13:29.843 --> 13:32.245
we're saying they stone-cold
dissed you.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.546
Also, I saw them
all at the school.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.249
Okay, we're talking about
the Goldberg Girls here.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.817
You boys are dead wrong.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.752
Nope. They were
meeting Coach Mellor
about the ski trip.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.289
Well, that's a kick
in the downstairs stuff!

13:42.322 --> 13:43.957
This is the classic
friend diss,

13:43.991 --> 13:46.359
like the time I only had
three tickets
to the Eagles game

13:46.393 --> 13:48.095
and told Matthew we all
got stuck in an elevator.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.597
What?
Do you mind,
I'm helping my mom here.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.733
They're meeting without you,
just like we all met for ribs
after the Eagles game.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.103
Stop telling him about
our special day, dude!

13:56.136 --> 13:58.171
I'm trying to be
cool about this,
but it's getting hard.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.540
It's not always about you,
Matt Bradley!

14:00.573 --> 14:02.876
And don't be
a Matt Bradley.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.978
Be the Barry
and take charge.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.314
**

14:07.347 --> 14:11.618
I'd say your best exercise,
pre-skiing,
is probably the wall sit.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.686
Now, the wall is just there,
just keeps you honest.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.854
Well, well.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.524
If it isn't
the Goldberg Girls,
minus the Goldberg.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.625
Beverly, great news!

14:18.658 --> 14:21.261
Our pink eye
and our scurvy cleared up!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.196
It was whooping cough,
and save it.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.332
Look, we didn't want
to hurt your feelings,

14:25.365 --> 14:26.599
but the ski trip
is tomorrow,

14:26.633 --> 14:28.368
and we still have
a ton of work to do.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.536
Skip it, Linda.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.404
And to think I wanted to live
with the three of you

14:31.438 --> 14:33.473
in a beautiful
Miami bungalow

14:33.506 --> 14:36.076
with wicker furniture
and bright floral patterns.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.510
Is that what this
is about?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.746
You forcing us to be
your Golden Girls?

14:39.779 --> 14:42.415
Well, I don't know about
"forcing,"
but maybe "tricking."

14:42.449 --> 14:45.785
How about we do neither
and plan a ski trip
like normal people?

14:45.818 --> 14:48.121
She's right. I just don't have
time to be a Goldberg Girl.

14:48.155 --> 14:51.524
But I thought we could travel
down the road and back again.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.193
My heart is true.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.062
You're pals
and my confidants.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.429
I don't even know you.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.931
Essie,
if you threw a party

14:57.965 --> 14:59.466
and invited
everyone you knew...

14:59.499 --> 15:00.900
Yeah, we all know
the theme song.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.836
...you would see the biggest
gift would be from me.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.973
And do you know what the card
attached would say?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.410
"Thank you
for being a friend"?
Exactly.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.613
Bev, we all have families
and millions of things to do.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.382
We just don't have time
for friends.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.487
Good luck
with your ski trip.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.558
All right, anyway,
back to what I was saying.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.261
So, you want to use the wall
for a wall sit, okay?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.597
Hold this position
for at least half an hour.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.102
ADULT ADAM: The Goldberg Girls
may have iced out my mom,

15:35.135 --> 15:38.705
but Barry was ready
to crush fresh powder
on the senior ski trip.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.643
All right, me and the JTP
are off to the slopes.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.911
Check the news
for an avalanche,

15:44.944 --> 15:47.180
'cause Big Tasty's
going to hit
that mountain hard.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.848
Well, have fun
with your friends.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.151
At least one of us will.
You okay?

15:51.184 --> 15:52.986
What happened to your stupid
Goldberg ladies club?

15:53.020 --> 15:56.023
They're busy moms.
There's no room for friends.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.858
ADULT ADAM: My mom's posse
had abandoned her, which
offended Barry to his core.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.195
Hi. Is your mom home?

16:02.229 --> 16:04.931
Your kind is not welcome
in my home. So beat it!

16:04.964 --> 16:07.367
No, no, I'm here.
I'm here. What's wrong?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.969
There is a huge snowstorm
upstate.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.071
All the roads are closed.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.939
And so is this
conversation.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.607
No one disrespects
my mama!

16:14.641 --> 16:16.043
You're all a bunch
of garbage!

16:16.076 --> 16:17.744
Hey, Barry, dial it back
a little bit.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.080
Bevy, we are really sorry
for excluding you,

16:20.113 --> 16:21.948
but you are the only one
who can help us!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.816
Put a sock in it,
Kremp!

16:23.850 --> 16:25.418
We both saw
this day coming.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.021
Come on! Hit me! Free punch!
Right there! Right there!

16:28.055 --> 16:30.257
He's sweet defending you,
but this isn't about us.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.924
It's okay.
He's just a little riled up.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.094
Yeah, I am!
Come get some, Ginzy!

16:34.127 --> 16:35.428
Maybe we should come back?

16:35.462 --> 16:38.598
Maybe you should screw off
for making my precious
mother so sad.

16:38.631 --> 16:39.866
Barry, not okay.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.301
Go in the yard
and clomp it off.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.702
Fine!

16:44.304 --> 16:45.805
The school canceled
the senior ski trip.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.074
We don't know
what to do.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.442
The whole class is heading
to the bus right now,

16:49.476 --> 16:50.743
and they are going
to be heartbroken.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.446
No hearts are gonna
break today,

16:53.480 --> 16:55.848
not if our ski committee
has anything to say about it.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.719
Okay, we've got tons to do
and no time to do it.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.489
Ginz, hit the bakery,
get hot chocolate
and doughnuts.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.125
Linda, call Principal Ball,
tell him to unlock the school

17:05.158 --> 17:06.693
so we can access
the cafeteria.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.328
Essie,
hit the Baederwood Market.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.896
We need a dolly, wax paper,

17:09.929 --> 17:11.364
and white zin!
On it!

17:11.398 --> 17:14.834
This is going to be
the best non-ski ski trip
the world has ever seen!

17:14.867 --> 17:16.503
Listen up
and settle down!

17:16.536 --> 17:18.305
The trip is off.
There's nothing we can do.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.208
But I've been waiting
four years for this ski trip.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.509
It's very disappointing.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.979
**

17:27.013 --> 17:29.416
* Thank you for being
a friend

17:30.717 --> 17:34.020
* Traveled down the road
and back again

17:34.053 --> 17:35.522
* Your heart is true

17:35.555 --> 17:38.925
* You're a pal
and a confidant

17:39.692 --> 17:42.195
Look,
it's four hot moms.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.997
* And if you threw a party

17:45.031 --> 17:48.668
* Invited everyone you knew

17:48.701 --> 17:51.070
* You would see
the biggest gift
BEVERLY: Step aside, Mellor.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.606
These kids won't be denied
their special memory.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.175
Not on our watch.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.578
* Thank you for being a friend

17:58.611 --> 18:00.747
ADULT ADAM: That night,
my mom's ski committee

18:00.780 --> 18:05.152
waxed up some lunch trays
and gave the senior class
a night they'd never forget.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.655
* Thank you for
being a friend *

18:08.688 --> 18:11.090
ADULT ADAM: Turns out,
all it takes to have
a legendary weekend

18:11.124 --> 18:13.160
is friends at your side,

18:13.193 --> 18:14.827
no matter
what the weather brings.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.763
Hey.
Don't "hey" me.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.698
You saw the mower?
I saw the mower.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.201
This is your fault!
I'm you!

18:21.234 --> 18:23.670
I'm stubborn and irritable

18:23.703 --> 18:25.738
and don't like talking
about my feelings.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.307
And now I'm going
back to school

18:27.340 --> 18:29.442
and I don't even get
to say goodbye to Geoff.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.545
All right, I'm going
to tell you something

18:32.579 --> 18:34.381
that I've never told
anyone before.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.317
When I was your age,

18:37.350 --> 18:39.786
I stood outside
of your mom's window

18:39.819 --> 18:43.156
and I read her a poem,
that I wrote,

18:43.190 --> 18:46.159
about her beautiful
emerald eyes.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.828
Point is,
if you're really like me,

18:49.862 --> 18:53.366
then there's a little
romantic in you, too.

18:53.400 --> 18:57.069
ADULT ADAM: And just like
all those romantic movies
Erica hated to watch,

18:57.103 --> 18:58.605
she found herself running
through the night

18:58.638 --> 19:02.175
to stop her one true love
from getting on a bus.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.944
Unfortunately,
it was long gone.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.014
But as fate would have it,
she still had the chance
to speak from her heart.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.616
Erica?
Geoff!

19:09.649 --> 19:11.651
Okay, what's going on?
Why are you here?

19:11.684 --> 19:13.620
Listen, I am never going
to be the kind of girl

19:13.653 --> 19:16.088
that covers stairs
with flowers

19:16.122 --> 19:18.391
or stands on your lawn
with a boom box.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.729
But you need to know,
really know,

19:23.896 --> 19:25.898
that I love you
more than anything.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.169
And I wish that I could put
how I feel

19:30.203 --> 19:34.374
into some kind of amazing,
romantic gesture, but I can't.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.544
Well, that's
a pretty good start.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.580
**

19:42.014 --> 19:44.484
ADULT ADAM: Truth is,
the people you love
don't always act

19:44.517 --> 19:46.853
like they do on TV
or in the movies.

19:46.886 --> 19:50.390
In real life, it's about
weathering the storm together

19:50.423 --> 19:52.625
and learning to laugh
when things get tough.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.461
* Thank you for
being a friend

19:54.494 --> 19:56.162
* I wanna thank you

19:56.195 --> 19:58.197
ADULT ADAM: In the end that's
the greatest thank you...

19:58.231 --> 19:59.699
For being a friend.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.802
You know, we really do make
one heck of
a ski committee, huh?

20:02.835 --> 20:03.936
Yeah.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.538
You know what,
I think we could make

20:05.572 --> 20:08.007
a pretty damn good
group of friends.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.376
What are you saying...?

20:09.409 --> 20:11.311
We're saying after this,
we should find a restaurant

20:11.344 --> 20:12.879
that has cheesecake
on the menu.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.548
And white zin!
Essie,
you are such a Blanche!

20:15.582 --> 20:16.783
I really am!

20:18.485 --> 20:19.986
To the Goldberg Girls.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.355
ALL: The Goldberg Girls!

20:22.389 --> 20:24.624
Oh, my God, this white zin
is to die for.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.793
And I have a coupon!

20:26.826 --> 20:28.695
Oh, you guys,
look over there.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.996
So cute, right?

20:30.029 --> 20:32.064
Oh, I hope that's us
when we're old.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.933
Did that lady
just call us "old"?

20:33.966 --> 20:36.736
Some people are just so
rude these days.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.306
Oy, this white zin
is to die for.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.940
And I have a coupon!

20:43.676 --> 20:47.680
**

20:53.185 --> 20:56.923
This is the kind
of friendship where
we just laugh.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.726
Barry kept saying,
"I wish Mrs. Kremp
was my mother".

20:59.759 --> 21:02.529
And I'd say, "Good.
Go across the street
and live there."

21:02.562 --> 21:04.130
Beverly is definitely
our Dorothy.

21:04.163 --> 21:07.199
The leader of the group,
I'd say, probably is Bev.

21:07.233 --> 21:10.637
She's the one with
the big mouth that,
you know, takes over.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.772
Could Beverly
have ever been a lawyer?

21:12.805 --> 21:13.973
Are you kidding me?

21:14.006 --> 21:16.242
Beverly could definitely
have been a lawyer.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.544
No one argues like me.

21:17.577 --> 21:21.514
She has a brain
like nobody else's

21:21.548 --> 21:23.483
I have ever seen
in my life.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.518
What are you doing?

21:25.552 --> 21:27.820
Did we bleep that? Yeah.
Let's bleep that.
