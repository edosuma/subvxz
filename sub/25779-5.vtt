WEBVTT

00:50.960 --> 00:53.122
I love the smell of chlorine.

00:53.260 --> 00:54.466
It reminds me of home.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.712
Three days by the pool
and my brain is already melted.

01:00.470 --> 01:01.460
Well...

01:02.850 --> 01:03.976
It's beautiful.

01:04.099 --> 01:05.590
The Tongva Indians,

01:05.730 --> 01:08.768
they lived like this for 3,000 years.

01:09.150 --> 01:10.936
Yeah, 3,000 years.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.140
No war.

01:12.820 --> 01:14.481
No hassle.

01:14.610 --> 01:16.601
Total freaking paradise.

01:17.950 --> 01:19.361
Ever heard of Paul Gauguin?

01:20.280 --> 01:21.281
No.

01:21.410 --> 01:24.653
He was a stockbroker in Paris,
but then he quit to become an artist.

01:25.540 --> 01:27.872
He sailed for Tahiti
and never came back.

01:28.540 --> 01:29.746
I like this guy.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.714
He left behind his wife and kids,
and when he got to Tahiti,

01:35.840 --> 01:37.797
he gave half the island syphilis.

01:41.010 --> 01:42.000
Why tell me this?

01:42.720 --> 01:44.677
Because there's no such thing
as paradise.

01:58.860 --> 01:59.861
Yeah, there is.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.090
What is it?

02:28.940 --> 02:30.055
I had a dream.

02:33.110 --> 02:36.148
Can't really describe it, but...

02:38.070 --> 02:39.981
My dad used to blow smoke rings.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.237
And when Liz and I were little,

02:43.370 --> 02:45.111
he'd sit on the end
of the couch and...

02:46.410 --> 02:47.616
he'd take a...

02:47.750 --> 02:51.163
a big drag of his cigarette,
and he'd puff a few out at a time.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.543
Me and Liz would try
to fight to catch them.

03:02.510 --> 03:04.308
I don't remember any of my dreams.

03:08.350 --> 03:10.557
All hail the Joan of Arc of Booze.

03:11.310 --> 03:12.436
Was I that bad?

03:12.940 --> 03:13.930
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:15.690 --> 03:18.603
The details of that night
are a little fuzzy to me.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.528
How did we end up
in that Corporate guy's apartment?

03:21.660 --> 03:24.197
Who cares?
No point digging up the past.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.288
I captured some moments
for us on Instagram

03:27.410 --> 03:28.946
so we could remember them always.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.206
Please, no.

03:30.830 --> 03:33.458
I hear you, Liz.
The Internet's an abattoir.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.162
We're the butcher and the pig.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.200
I added some fun filters.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.837
It looks like
you and Corporate hit it off.

03:47.430 --> 03:49.307
That is horrifying.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.590
Make it stop.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.590
OK.

04:00.530 --> 04:01.600
Hey, Veronica.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.071
I hope you have a lovely day!

04:06.740 --> 04:08.651
Don't bother. She's not there.

04:17.670 --> 04:18.740
Hey, Gloria.

04:20.209 --> 04:22.372
I think your mom's got
a leaky diaper.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.836
Oh, God.

04:27.510 --> 04:28.887
-Just go.
-I can--

04:29.260 --> 04:30.261
Please.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.261
-OK?
-OK.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.390
I'll...

04:39.320 --> 04:40.310
See you later.

05:16.770 --> 05:17.760
Larry?

05:18.310 --> 05:19.436
What are you doing?

05:21.070 --> 05:23.311
Sometimes )
the pump dragon makes noise.

05:24.900 --> 05:25.981
Pump dragon?

05:27.200 --> 05:28.190
What?

05:30.660 --> 05:32.867
I need to change the combo
on that lock.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.076
Keep the riff-raff out.

06:24.380 --> 06:25.620
I said no calls.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.798
I know we're on a break or whatever,
but it's Larry.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.216
Something's off about him.

06:30.340 --> 06:33.344
He's together one sec,
and the next he's talking nonsense.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.097
I told you, I...

06:38.190 --> 06:39.339
I need boundaries.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.608
I can't be your person right now.
I'm too busy.

06:42.730 --> 06:43.720
Doing what?

06:43.860 --> 06:45.771
Pissing away my afternoons.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.561
It's my writing process.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.567
I've got to go. Sorry.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.610
Gil!

07:35.870 --> 07:37.110
You're trespassing.

07:39.410 --> 07:40.536
I know. Sorry.

07:41.330 --> 07:44.789
Don't be. I'm just following
the script my employer handed me.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.035
I don't believe in it.

07:46.590 --> 07:47.955
You're not trespassing.

07:48.550 --> 07:50.962
Aerospace was built
on government investment,

07:51.090 --> 07:52.626
using our tax dollars, right,

07:52.760 --> 07:54.888
which created jobs,

07:55.010 --> 07:57.843
which created more tax revenue,
which created more missiles,

07:57.970 --> 07:59.267
which created more suburbs.

07:59.390 --> 08:02.519
It was a giant golden circle jerk,

08:02.640 --> 08:04.051
and it belongs to all of us.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.858
Did you see a guy on a bike
come through?

08:09.990 --> 08:12.061
No, but I'm at the end of my shift.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.770
I'm not firing on all cylinders.

08:24.210 --> 08:25.200
Well...

08:26.340 --> 08:27.990
I hope a few days off was...

08:29.590 --> 08:30.409
restful.

08:30.550 --> 08:32.039
I wanted to talk to you about--

08:32.169 --> 08:34.047
Jeremy, I'm...

08:34.179 --> 08:35.169
I'm sorry.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.678
I know Corporate's visit
was important to you.

08:37.799 --> 08:42.510
The problem is I am cursed with
a high tolerance for alcohol,

08:42.640 --> 08:45.223
so I can go and go.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.556
But then, at some point,

08:46.690 --> 08:49.068
I, like, go over the falls.

08:49.190 --> 08:51.852
And then, before I know it,
I'm a "different person,”

08:51.990 --> 08:53.606
only I can't remember anything

08:53.740 --> 08:55.151
because I've blacked out,

08:55.280 --> 08:56.657
and for the next few days

08:56.780 --> 08:59.943
I stew in a nice hot bath of shame.

09:02.450 --> 09:04.202
Well, actually,

09:04.330 --> 09:06.992
Corporate was quite charmed
with his visit.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.247
In fact, he's upping our ad budget.

09:11.630 --> 09:13.462
You two really hit it off.

09:13.590 --> 09:15.797
No. No, we didn't. Screw that guy.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.297
Some little mannequin in a suit.

09:18.430 --> 09:21.263
I've never heard you laugh
like that before.

09:21.390 --> 09:24.098
Ever. Gerson has it on tape,
I think, if you want--

09:24.230 --> 09:26.892
What did you want
to talk to me about?

09:29.110 --> 09:32.523
The other night,
while you were going over the falls,

09:32.650 --> 09:36.735
I realized that I have developed...

09:38.200 --> 09:39.190
feelings...

09:40.240 --> 09:41.230
for you.

09:42.580 --> 09:44.321
-Jeremy, you're married.
-I know.

09:44.450 --> 09:47.203
Also, and this is
kind of important...

09:48.920 --> 09:51.662
I have
absolutely zero feelings for you.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.416
-Zero. None.
-I know.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.797
It's ridiculous.

09:56.380 --> 09:57.711
But I can't help it, Liz.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.389
I mean, you're so smart

10:00.510 --> 10:01.591
and you're so...

10:04.020 --> 10:05.010
competent.

10:06.600 --> 10:10.059
-I have dreams about you.
-Dreams don't mean anything.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.228
Listen, I've been talking about this
with Sarah in couples therapy.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.943
And it's been a little hard at first,

10:17.070 --> 10:18.856
but we finally got it out.

10:18.990 --> 10:21.027
I actually think it's bringing us...

10:22.450 --> 10:23.531
closer together.

10:25.700 --> 10:26.701
Happy to help.

10:26.830 --> 10:30.243
I realize I've uploaded
a lot of challenging info here.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.700
I just hope you don't...

10:33.460 --> 10:34.586
hold it against me.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.079
No.

10:36.210 --> 10:37.962
I just want to get it out
in the open.

10:38.510 --> 10:41.138
That way,
it doesn't morph into this...

10:42.050 --> 10:43.711
you know, weird...

10:44.560 --> 10:45.550
thing.

10:49.310 --> 10:50.300
Yeah.

10:54.610 --> 10:55.429
What's up?

10:55.570 --> 10:56.560
Hey.

10:56.940 --> 10:58.647
Yeah, I'm just hanging at the Lodge.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.566
I'm excited about Blaise's lecture.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.362
-Hey, I'm kind of working right now.
-Yeah, me, too.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.948
I'm on call. Temp Joy, you know?

11:06.080 --> 11:07.787
-Did you need something?
-No.

11:07.910 --> 11:10.072
Just wanted to see
what you were doing.

11:10.210 --> 11:11.951
Thought I'd call you, see what's up.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.627
Well, like I said, I'm working.

11:14.130 --> 11:17.122
Yeah. So, how are things going
with the Connie situation?

11:17.590 --> 11:19.752
Are you guys still on a break or...?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.792
Yeah, but I really don't have time.

11:23.510 --> 11:26.172
Don't worry about it.
I've got your back. We're in cahoots.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.177
-We are not in cahoots, OK?
-We're in cahoots. It's OK.

11:29.310 --> 11:31.187
No, we're not in cahoots.

11:32.980 --> 11:33.970
Hey

11:34.440 --> 11:38.354
Every wack job in the city is gonna
show up for Blaise's magic show.

11:42.910 --> 11:43.945
Hey, Larry.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.981
How did... When did you come in?

11:46.540 --> 11:49.692
Hey, I feel bad about
punching you in the face.

11:50.290 --> 11:51.496
Let me make it up to you.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.378
-You got time this week?
-Yeah.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.377
Well, good, good. I'll come find you.

11:56.880 --> 11:57.870
OK.

12:02.970 --> 12:04.085
So, I was thinking,

12:04.220 --> 12:07.349
gold is valuable
because it's rare, right?

12:07.470 --> 12:09.131
But if we could make gold,

12:09.270 --> 12:10.977
then it wouldn't be rare any more.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.341
So, by making gold,

12:13.480 --> 12:14.595
we're sort of...

12:15.810 --> 12:17.016
destroying gold.

12:17.150 --> 12:20.814
You're talking about market value.
Merrill didn't care about that.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.910
He called gold
"the residue of eternity."

12:24.320 --> 12:25.401
What does that mean?

12:26.700 --> 12:30.864
Gold is the material by-product
of the Magnum Opus -

12:31.000 --> 12:35.915
the reconciliation of body,
spirit and time.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.580
Hey...

12:38.300 --> 12:39.495
Hey, Blaise, are you OK?

12:41.800 --> 12:43.290
I don't understand any of it.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.252
Alchemy's all shadows and riddles,
like Smith's diary.

12:47.390 --> 12:50.132
I'll never figure it out.
I can't get my mind around anything!

12:50.270 --> 12:53.012
What? You're one of
the smartest-sounding guys I've met!

12:53.140 --> 12:54.130
I'm a fraud.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.767
I barely cracked 900 on my SATSs.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.267
Nine hundred?
Well, that's not so bad.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.142
I don't remember what I got.
My sister got into the thousands.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.191
Tomorrow,
I'm supposed to give a lecture

13:04.320 --> 13:07.984
explaining the genius
of Harwood Fritz Merrill.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.735
I can't!

13:09.870 --> 13:11.440
It's gonna be a nightmare!

13:12.250 --> 13:14.457
I posted about it
in all my esoterica chat rooms.

13:14.580 --> 13:17.663
People said they're coming, and some
of those guys are real weirdos.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.246
Lonely men with an ax to grind.

13:20.670 --> 13:21.956
If I get one thing wrong,

13:22.090 --> 13:24.582
they are gonna destroy me in the Q&A.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.006
Hey, hey! Hey!

13:27.140 --> 13:28.881
Easy, easy, easy.

13:29.010 --> 13:31.001
OK. Hey. OK.
Do I need to call a doctor?

13:31.140 --> 13:33.131
I think your appendix
might be exploding.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.977
I am a doctor.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.470
OK.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.732
It's not my appendix.

13:45.150 --> 13:48.654
A few years ago in India,
I picked up a mysterious parasite.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.363
It used to cause me terrible pain
all the time.

13:53.910 --> 13:57.414
The square medical establishment was
no help. They couldn't get it out.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.119
Some of the "professionals"
even suggested it wasn't there,

14:02.250 --> 14:03.661
that it was in my mind,

14:03.800 --> 14:06.007
even though I could feel it
growing inside me.

14:08.050 --> 14:09.506
Heal thyself.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.250
That's what I had to do.

14:11.930 --> 14:14.718
So I started reading Paracelsus,

14:14.850 --> 14:19.720
found some ancient alchemical
remedies that... actually helped.

14:19.850 --> 14:20.851
But...

14:22.230 --> 14:23.561
there are no miracles.

14:26.650 --> 14:28.652
We have to learn
to live with these things.

14:31.450 --> 14:32.770
All we can do...

14:33.910 --> 14:35.617
is manage the pain.

14:44.590 --> 14:45.580
Here it is.

14:46.170 --> 14:47.831
Official letter from London.

14:49.180 --> 14:52.923
It says, "An emissary
has been selected and briefed."

14:53.600 --> 14:57.264
And we should expect someone
to arrive within...

14:58.270 --> 14:59.340
a fortnight.

15:00.940 --> 15:02.931
I'm gonna do a shot
before the meeting.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.179
Yeah, OK.

15:05.570 --> 15:06.640
A fortnight.

15:07.190 --> 15:08.442
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:08.570 --> 15:13.519
Did you know that Blaise
has a parasite living inside of him?

15:13.660 --> 15:14.946
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.821
I've heard that tale many times.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.156
Yeah, yeah.

15:19.290 --> 15:21.281
Pretty crazy week, huh?

15:22.710 --> 15:23.916
Solid turnout tonight.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.792
I guess either
you're all happy I'm back,

15:26.920 --> 15:29.719
or you just wanted
to hear about our mummy.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.171
I can't help you with that,

15:31.300 --> 15:33.792
but you've probably seen
our flyers around.

15:34.970 --> 15:37.519
Our Majestic Knight, Blaise St. John,

15:37.640 --> 15:40.632
is giving a public lecture
tomorrow night,

15:40.770 --> 15:42.056
God help us all.

15:44.730 --> 15:45.811
It's about...

15:47.610 --> 15:49.180
Well, fill us in. Fill us in.

15:49.320 --> 15:53.029
It's about the alchemic underpinnings
of the death ritual of Wallace Smith,

15:53.160 --> 15:54.525
how it references the...

15:56.660 --> 15:59.322
the legendary burial
of Harwood Fritz Merrill.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.450
Can't wait.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.246
OK.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.120
One more announcement.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.581
As you know,
I am stepping down from my throne

16:11.720 --> 16:15.099
and handing it over
to Ernie Fontaine.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.726
Yeah! Yeah!

16:24.150 --> 16:26.642
We are all looking forward
to the succession ceremony.

16:26.770 --> 16:28.932
In fact, I am so excited,

16:29.070 --> 16:33.064
I have decided we should do it ASAP
on Friday night.

16:33.490 --> 16:34.480
Sound good?

16:35.280 --> 16:37.658
Wait a minute.
Shouldn't we wait for London?

16:38.160 --> 16:40.447
Since they have to sign off
to make it official.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.867
I am Sovereign Protector of Lodge 49.

16:45.710 --> 16:47.087
You know what I say?

16:48.340 --> 16:49.830
Screw London!

16:57.300 --> 16:58.290
All right.

17:03.890 --> 17:08.224
Congrats, Ernie. It looks like you're
going on the Grand Tour after all.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.476
Thanks. I appreciate it.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.107
Yeah. Congratulations, Ernie.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.690
Thanks.

17:22.700 --> 17:23.826
You know, I was...

17:24.660 --> 17:25.991
I was thinking.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.121
Maybe...

17:28.130 --> 17:30.371
sometime we can get you out
on the Sea-Doos.

17:32.630 --> 17:33.620
Yeah.

17:34.090 --> 17:35.080
Sure.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.886
Just rebuilt the engines.

17:38.180 --> 17:39.591
657X.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.598
All new bearings and pins...

17:44.270 --> 17:45.886
seals and gaskets.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.010
They, you know...

17:49.560 --> 17:50.721
They ride like a dream.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.936
Like a dream.

17:54.780 --> 17:55.895
We should go, hon.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.116
How can you stand it?

18:15.840 --> 18:16.875
Hey.

18:17.340 --> 18:18.580
Hey, stranger.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.597
I know, right?

18:21.390 --> 18:22.755
Lil' Chefs just started.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.057
They're making crme brle
this week.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.437
-They get to use torches.
-Yeah.

18:28.350 --> 18:30.091
So, what's up in Lizard Land?

18:30.230 --> 18:31.300
Very little.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.471
Happy to have the place
to yourself again?

18:36.780 --> 18:39.818
So, things must be going well
with... what's-her-face.

18:39.950 --> 18:40.769
Gloria.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.731
Yeah, her name's Gloria.

18:42.870 --> 18:44.110
And, yeah.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.619
It's been super intense.

18:48.250 --> 18:49.320
You know? She's...

18:50.630 --> 18:52.120
I don't know how to describe her.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.456
She's just, like...

18:54.380 --> 18:57.338
super... intense, you know?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.791
Well, it sounds intense.
When can I meet her?

19:02.600 --> 19:05.672
Why don't you bring her by Shamroxx?
I'll comp your meals.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.050
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:07.930 --> 19:08.931
Thanks, Liz.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.527
Yeah, it's Gloria. I got to go.

19:18.150 --> 19:19.481
What about Lil' Chefs?

19:20.700 --> 19:22.156
You can just text me who wins.

19:22.660 --> 19:23.695
All right? See ya!

19:25.620 --> 19:29.830
Gentlemen, I have been in
the plumbing-rep biz since 1977.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.280
It's been a crazy ride.

19:32.420 --> 19:36.084
I've seen and done things
other men can only dream of.

19:37.260 --> 19:42.539
But I can't say
that I've ever been... abducted

19:42.680 --> 19:44.000
by a group of developers

19:44.140 --> 19:46.552
driving around in a black SUV
on a Sunday.

19:46.890 --> 19:49.052
It happened! I'm not making it up!

19:49.180 --> 19:50.682
What is going on with you?

19:50.810 --> 19:52.596
He's got PTSD from Vietnam.

19:52.730 --> 19:55.267
Vietnam

19:55.400 --> 19:58.938
No, no, no, no. Ernie was in
the Balkans on a holiday cruise.

19:59.070 --> 20:01.698
I was fighting ethnonationalism.

20:01.820 --> 20:03.811
At least I served.
What did you ever do?

20:03.950 --> 20:06.112
Cashed the biggest
commission check of my life.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.618
Yeah, well, when I find Captain...

20:08.750 --> 20:11.208
Jesus! Ernie, you're chasing shadows!

20:11.330 --> 20:14.129
But I saw it all, the whole plan.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.127
I'm telling you! Don't you see?

20:16.250 --> 20:18.127
The billboards are all over town!

20:18.250 --> 20:19.911
"Is there another way to live?"

20:20.050 --> 20:22.041
I've been getting angry calls
all week.

20:22.470 --> 20:24.131
You're not servicing your accounts.

20:26.470 --> 20:28.427
Stop being a diva, Ernie.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.633
I actually couldn't tell if they
called me "gook" or "kook."

20:32.770 --> 20:35.478
-I don't know which is worse.
-Oh, my God.

20:36.020 --> 20:39.320
The Kringle brothers, man.
OC Luftwaffe dickheads.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.568
To be fair,
I kept dropping in on Travis.

20:41.690 --> 20:45.365
Hey, Lady-shreds-a-lot, OK,
you need to be careful out there.

20:45.490 --> 20:46.480
I'm serious.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.736
If something happens in the water

20:48.870 --> 20:50.747
and no one's there
to look out for you...

20:51.910 --> 20:55.073
Hey, I'm going back out after work.
Come with me.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.201
Sorry, but I have a date.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.330
Human Resources?

20:58.460 --> 20:59.450
-Yeah.
-Still?

20:59.590 --> 21:00.580
Yeah, still.

21:02.510 --> 21:05.753
You know, this past week's been
one of the best weeks I've had

21:05.890 --> 21:07.005
in a long time.

21:08.930 --> 21:10.887
Kind of feel like
I'm floating on air.

21:13.980 --> 21:15.470
All right. See you later.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.590
Peace.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.898
-Your note's due.
-What

21:22.030 --> 21:25.022
89.9.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.777
Take as much time as you want.

21:32.330 --> 21:33.707
What are my options, Burt?

21:36.040 --> 21:37.576
OK, so, car title loan.

21:37.710 --> 21:39.166
You give me three grand,

21:39.290 --> 21:41.748
I give it to you -
settles my signature loan.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.791
And then I'm good for... how long?

21:45.550 --> 21:46.369
Two weeks.

21:48.510 --> 21:50.342
I'm giving you horrible terms.

21:51.350 --> 21:53.170
Even worse than your sig loan.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.342
This is probably
the dumbest decision you can make.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.816
But I'm good for two weeks?

22:12.620 --> 22:15.453
...a local fraternal order
has given new meaning

22:15.580 --> 22:18.663
to the phrase "pyramid scheme”"
after an unexpected...

22:18.790 --> 22:20.030
Oh, my God.

22:21.250 --> 22:23.708
Members discovered
a sealed-off room, and within it,

22:23.840 --> 22:26.912
the preserved body of a man who
had been there since nineteen...

22:32.180 --> 22:33.215
This could be it.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.519
-The True Lodge.
-Hey, Avery, wake your ass up!

22:36.640 --> 22:39.018
-Let's get moving.
-I know, but I got to get in there.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.606
-Thanks for waiting.
-Sit down!

22:57.790 --> 23:00.111
So, should I just come in, or...?

23:01.130 --> 23:02.120
What?

23:03.420 --> 23:05.752
Are you gonna call me in
because you need something?

23:08.970 --> 23:11.792
You should just... come in, I guess.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.590
OK.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.606
Hi, Ms. Keller.

23:24.360 --> 23:26.897
I brought you those files
that you asked for.

23:27.780 --> 23:30.192
The...
Sorry, you didn't ask for anything.

23:30.860 --> 23:33.568
I can go get you some of those files.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.691
Sorry, this is why I thought
it might be a good idea

23:36.830 --> 23:38.241
to have a reason to come--

23:38.370 --> 23:39.360
Just...

23:40.410 --> 23:42.663
put them... there.

23:44.710 --> 23:48.453
Wait. So, I do have files, or...?
Sorry, I know it doesn't matter.

23:48.590 --> 23:52.174
It's just, I think, you know,
a certain amount of realism adds to--

23:52.300 --> 23:54.041
-This was a bad idea.
-No, no, no!

23:54.180 --> 23:55.750
We can make it work.

23:55.890 --> 23:56.880
Look, we just...

23:57.010 --> 24:00.014
Let's just get something down
on paper, you know? Let's map it out.

24:01.350 --> 24:02.761
OK. All right. Hey.

24:03.940 --> 24:06.978
Forget about it. Let's just...
go to a movie or something.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.310
A movie?

24:10.320 --> 24:11.981
Oh, no, no, no. We're not dating.

24:12.410 --> 24:15.482
This isn't going anywhere.
This is just sex.

24:16.530 --> 24:19.329
I don't mean that to sound...
because it's been good.

24:19.450 --> 24:20.747
It's been amazing.

24:21.580 --> 24:22.911
But I don't want you to...

24:25.540 --> 24:27.451
Dud, I kill everything I touch.

24:27.590 --> 24:28.796
Oh, come on.

24:29.590 --> 24:31.126
Don't be ridiculous.

24:32.090 --> 24:33.216
You're wrong.

24:33.340 --> 24:36.093
Because that first night
that we spent together,

24:36.220 --> 24:38.962
when we stayed up
until dawn talking...

24:39.770 --> 24:41.920
that wasn't just sex.

24:43.390 --> 24:44.516
I mean,

24:44.650 --> 24:47.859
obviously it led to more sex,

24:47.980 --> 24:48.970
but...

24:51.150 --> 24:53.642
You're the first person in a year...

24:55.030 --> 24:57.863
who's looked at me the way
that people used to.

24:59.910 --> 25:01.696
Like I was a normal person,

25:01.830 --> 25:03.070
walking around...

25:04.500 --> 25:05.490
normally.

25:09.380 --> 25:11.087
And I saw you.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.218
I mean, it took me while,
because I'm an idiot,

25:15.340 --> 25:18.423
and you were hidden behind
all this... stuff.

25:19.140 --> 25:20.130
But...

25:21.430 --> 25:22.727
I saw you.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.151
-Oh, yeah!
-Give me the money!

25:44.330 --> 25:48.119
So... are you excited
for the ceremony tonight?

25:48.250 --> 25:50.207
Getting the keys
to the Sanctum Sanctorum?

25:50.340 --> 25:53.002
Yeah. But I kind of agree with Scott.

25:53.630 --> 25:55.086
Why not wait for London?

25:55.930 --> 25:57.466
Paperwork from on high.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.218
Man, who cares?
You've been waiting long enough.

26:00.890 --> 26:01.880
Besides...

26:02.720 --> 26:05.553
since when do you care
what Scott thinks?

26:13.230 --> 26:14.311
That was bad.

26:15.030 --> 26:16.566
It's been a mess lately.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.443
-Well, what do you expect?
-Connie's put everything on hold.

26:20.570 --> 26:23.733
I don't know if she can't decide or
if she just doesn't want to decide.

26:23.870 --> 26:24.940
Limbo, it's hell.

26:25.080 --> 26:29.039
I mean, hell is hell,
but limbo is also hell.

26:29.670 --> 26:31.661
It might actually be worse than hell.

26:32.250 --> 26:35.379
I mean, I want her to make the move,
but I'm dreading it, too.

26:35.510 --> 26:38.753
Once she tells Scott, everybody's
gonna think I'm the bad guy.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.881
To be fair, Ernie...

26:41.510 --> 26:42.636
you are the bad guy.

26:43.140 --> 26:45.973
I know. I know! It's a mess, man!

26:46.100 --> 26:48.979
Believe it or not, you are not
the first Lynx to have an affair.

26:49.520 --> 26:53.150
It comes out, people get upset,
and then you know what happens?

26:53.270 --> 26:55.227
Everyone gets on with their lives.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.351
Don't worry about
what other people think.

26:57.820 --> 27:00.278
The truth hurts,
but no one ever regrets hearing it.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.610
What's that?

27:03.410 --> 27:04.400
Wisdom?

27:07.710 --> 27:08.825
What do you think of Dud?

27:09.500 --> 27:12.663
He's all right. It's good to have
some young blood in the Lodge.

27:12.790 --> 27:13.780
Yeah, yeah.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.333
You know, at first I thought
they sent him to take me out,

27:17.470 --> 27:18.460
but that's absurd.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.218
And now I see they sent Dud
as a message.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.506
He has no idea what's going on.

27:25.680 --> 27:26.670
They?

27:27.390 --> 27:28.630
Who's they?

27:35.980 --> 27:37.186
What the hell is that?

27:38.070 --> 27:40.983
I guess Big Ben pulled the trigger
a little too early.

27:45.950 --> 27:46.940
I love it!

27:54.420 --> 27:56.331
Hey. Here you go.

27:56.460 --> 27:57.450
Thank you.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.871
-Hey!
-Hey.

28:00.300 --> 28:04.259
Welcome to America's third
or fourth most popular breastaurant!

28:05.430 --> 28:06.807
-Hi!
-Hey.

28:07.350 --> 28:08.920
What are you doing? We never hug.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.050
Hello.

28:10.640 --> 28:13.302
It's nice to meet you.
Dud's told me a lot about you.

28:16.150 --> 28:17.686
Well, have a seat.

28:17.820 --> 28:19.231
-I will be right back.
-OK.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.231
-I'm just gonna go talk to her.
-OK.

28:23.990 --> 28:24.980
Hey.

28:25.490 --> 28:29.370
<i>-Hey, you can comp everything, right?
- Ipromise.</i>

28:30.370 --> 28:32.418
Cool. Awesome. Isn't she great?

28:33.210 --> 28:34.029
Yeah.

28:34.170 --> 28:37.333
I mean, you didn't tell me she's,
like, 100 years old.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.257
No. No, she's not.

28:41.380 --> 28:42.677
Gloria's only...

28:43.300 --> 28:44.631
She's only...

28:45.390 --> 28:46.209
like...

28:46.350 --> 28:48.921
You know what?
I don't care how old she is, so...

28:49.060 --> 28:50.380
Yeah. This makes sense.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.511
She's going through
a mid-life crisis,

28:52.640 --> 28:54.438
you're the office boy
in a MILF video.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.550
No.

28:56.190 --> 28:58.761
-No, it's... it's not like that.
-Oh, yeah.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.390
No. It's... Because...

29:00.530 --> 29:03.522
And she's not a MILF.
She can't even have kids, OK?

29:04.110 --> 29:06.112
Her uterus is shaped wrong, so...

29:08.990 --> 29:09.980
Yeah.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.458
You don't even know her yet.
Give her a chance.

29:14.580 --> 29:16.127
No, you're right. I'm sorry.

29:16.630 --> 29:19.201
Look, sit down.
I'll bring over some wings.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.455
OK. Awesome.

29:26.470 --> 29:29.349
-Sorry I kept you waiting.
-Oh, that's fine.

29:40.900 --> 29:43.858
Welcome. Thank you for coming.
Welcome to Lodge 49.

29:46.740 --> 29:47.901
I'm quite nervous.

29:48.570 --> 29:51.232
I don't do a lot of public speaking.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.993
But I think I'm supposed
to picture you all naked.

30:02.210 --> 30:07.421
I'd like to start with a quote from
The Rosary of the Philosophers.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.423
"Wherever we have spoken openly,

30:10.550 --> 30:12.006
we have actually said nothing.

30:14.100 --> 30:18.515
But where we have written something
in code and in pictures,

30:18.650 --> 30:21.859
we have concealed the truth."

30:24.400 --> 30:27.654
Blaise, for Christ's sake,
you've got something in your nose.

30:28.030 --> 30:29.020
What?

30:44.920 --> 30:46.376
Make sure it doesn't break!

30:46.510 --> 30:48.046
Keep pulling! Keep pulling!

30:48.840 --> 30:50.330
Make sure it doesn't... No!

31:04.570 --> 31:06.026
-What is that?
-You got it!

31:10.070 --> 31:12.869
That was like
the greatest orgasm of my life!

31:12.990 --> 31:14.151
Oh, my God!

31:15.040 --> 31:17.657
Paracelsus, man! "Heal thyself"!

31:18.080 --> 31:19.320
Oh, yeah!

31:28.130 --> 31:29.256
Are you kidding me?

31:29.380 --> 31:31.041
I skipped the lecture.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.680
This is really nice.

31:43.770 --> 31:44.601
Speak.

31:46.610 --> 31:47.429
Limbo.

31:48.490 --> 31:49.480
What?

31:50.110 --> 31:51.851
Limbo is hell.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.021
I'm sick of it, you're sick of it.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.447
Scott doesn't know it yet,
but he's sick of it, too.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.657
I just want you to know
that when the truth comes out,

32:00.790 --> 32:02.497
I won't give a damn
what people think.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.120
I only care about you.

32:04.630 --> 32:07.759
And that's why you need
to make a decision.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.427
Scott! Go, go, go!

32:36.120 --> 32:38.157
So, you excited
for the ceremony tonight?

32:38.290 --> 32:39.280
Oh, sure.

32:39.410 --> 32:41.242
Hopefully it will erase the memory

32:41.370 --> 32:44.283
of Blaise pulling that goddamn worm
out of his head.

32:45.000 --> 32:45.990
Yeah.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.410
So, listen...

32:48.210 --> 32:51.259
Obviously,
you have no clue what's going on,

32:51.380 --> 32:53.838
but I just want to thank you, anyway.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.098
It's like I've been asleep
for a long time, and...

32:59.010 --> 33:00.921
when you walked into the Lodge...

33:02.690 --> 33:03.805
I finally woke up.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.470
What do you mean?

33:09.480 --> 33:11.642
You walked into the Lodge
for a reason.

33:12.190 --> 33:14.192
-It's all connected.
-I know!

33:14.320 --> 33:17.119
I know. I feel the same way.
I've been trying to tell everybody.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.369
I spent 50 years pouring concrete...

33:20.910 --> 33:22.241
drinking at the Lodge.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.570
I loved it.

33:26.250 --> 33:28.036
But now I see there's so much more.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.411
For the first time in my life...

33:32.760 --> 33:34.501
I'm above the maze.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.212
I just wish I'd started
looking for it sooner.

33:42.140 --> 33:43.266
Looking for what?

33:47.770 --> 33:51.559
OK. OK, yeah. Shadows and riddles.
It's all part of the deal, right?

33:53.780 --> 33:54.770
When I'm gone...

33:56.110 --> 33:57.817
you and Ernie have to stick together.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.229
You mean when you step down?

34:02.040 --> 34:03.030
Yeah.

34:04.660 --> 34:05.650
Yeah.

34:06.370 --> 34:07.360
Come on.

34:16.630 --> 34:18.428
Hello, Queen Liz.

34:19.090 --> 34:21.639
-It's your old pal, Corporate Bitch.
-What?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.342
You called me that the other night.

34:23.469 --> 34:26.268
You also called me Prince Crapface
and Fresno McBalls.

34:26.389 --> 34:27.630
We were having a blast!

34:28.190 --> 34:32.605
I don't remember calling you
Fresno McBalls,

34:32.730 --> 34:34.983
and I don't remember having a blast.

34:35.610 --> 34:37.521
You should check out
Gerson's Instagram.

34:38.070 --> 34:39.105
Why are you here?

34:40.159 --> 34:41.150
I...

34:42.080 --> 34:43.946
came to bring this by.

34:45.120 --> 34:48.612
Application form for the Omni exec
training program we talked about.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.121
My card's in there.

34:50.250 --> 34:52.878
Call me and I'll set you up
with our program director.

34:53.750 --> 34:54.751
No, thanks.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.214
I'm not trying to move up
the Shamroxx ladder, you know?

34:59.260 --> 35:01.922
Actually,
as part of our exec carousel,

35:02.050 --> 35:04.553
you'll be overseeing
all our eateries and fun zones.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.512
Actually, I'm good here.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.302
You seemed so excited.

35:10.440 --> 35:14.604
Well, you were talking to...
wasted me, OK?

35:14.730 --> 35:16.357
Wasted me is a delight.

35:16.690 --> 35:18.818
She laughs at everyone's jokes

35:18.950 --> 35:21.100
and makes big plans for the future.

35:21.240 --> 35:24.028
But now you're talking
to not-wasted me.

35:24.160 --> 35:27.903
She lives in reality and needs
to finish doing these inserts.

35:30.790 --> 35:32.372
OK, I get it.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.799
I guess... the other thing is...

35:38.840 --> 35:40.831
I had a really great time with you
on Sunday,

35:40.970 --> 35:43.507
and I was just wondering if,
you know, maybe you wanted--

35:44.930 --> 35:45.920
What?

35:47.270 --> 35:48.340
Nothing.

35:52.690 --> 35:53.680
Yeah.

35:56.690 --> 35:57.680
Excuse me.

36:47.280 --> 36:50.500
I've simulated this in therapy,
so I know what I'm going to say.

36:55.290 --> 36:57.452
There's a difference, Liz,

36:57.590 --> 37:00.799
between dreams and consummation.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.371
You want to be with me,
and I want to be with you.

37:04.510 --> 37:05.500
No.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.558
That's not it at all.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.306
I don't know what I was thinking.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.802
Can I please
just go back to work now?

37:21.320 --> 37:22.310
Of course.

37:40.590 --> 37:41.955
What are you doing?

37:42.090 --> 37:43.296
These are really good.

37:46.930 --> 37:48.045
How would you know?

37:51.600 --> 37:54.262
Those are just sketches.
It's a nervous habit.

37:55.890 --> 37:57.801
Did you take classes or something?

37:57.940 --> 37:58.930
Yes.

37:59.310 --> 38:00.607
Once, years ago.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.642
Worst in the class. The professor
said I'd never have a good line.

38:05.740 --> 38:07.026
What

38:07.160 --> 38:08.150
Screw him.

38:08.910 --> 38:10.947
He was right. I'm terrible.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.570
It saved me a lot of grief.

38:12.700 --> 38:14.907
Yeah, come on. Don't talk like that.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.576
Do you want me to lie?

38:16.710 --> 38:19.498
Say, "Yeah, I can be anything I want!
Anything's possible!"

38:19.630 --> 38:20.620
Hey.

38:21.630 --> 38:24.622
-What the hell's the matter?
-You think you see me.

38:25.340 --> 38:28.002
But you don't...
you don't see what I really am.

38:30.010 --> 38:31.045
The way I think.

38:33.270 --> 38:34.886
You're a good person. I'm not.

38:36.770 --> 38:37.976
What do you mean? You...

38:39.350 --> 38:42.263
-You take care of your mom.
-I wish she was dead.

38:43.650 --> 38:44.685
No, you don't.

38:44.820 --> 38:47.312
Believe me, it's all I think about.

38:48.070 --> 38:50.311
My life is waiting for her to die.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.020
I can't even look at her.

38:56.790 --> 38:58.952
Now you see
who you're really dealing with.

39:05.460 --> 39:07.121
But your mom's still here.

39:09.760 --> 39:10.750
She's not...

39:13.390 --> 39:16.382
You can still say
all the things that...

39:28.700 --> 39:29.690
Come here.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.361
Come here.

39:34.660 --> 39:35.650
Come on.

39:39.920 --> 39:40.910
Tell her.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.127
Tell her what you told me.

39:43.590 --> 39:44.580
What?

39:45.340 --> 39:46.330
No!

39:46.880 --> 39:47.870
Just do it.

39:49.050 --> 39:50.211
Look at her and say it.

39:54.050 --> 39:55.051
Say it.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.806
I want you to die.

40:17.330 --> 40:18.866
I want you to die.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.457
Will you please...

40:22.580 --> 40:24.070
Will you please die?

40:53.360 --> 40:56.068
-Not staying at Gloria's tonight?
-No.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.282
No. It was nice, but...

41:00.540 --> 41:01.530
it's over.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.286
I'm sorry.

41:03.420 --> 41:05.206
Are you OK?

41:05.580 --> 41:06.581
Yeah.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.166
Actually, I'm OK.

41:08.670 --> 41:11.207
It's probably for the best.
It wasn't going anywhere.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.376
Why waste each other's time?

41:15.550 --> 41:17.006
It wasn't a waste at all.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.716
Where's the remote?

41:23.270 --> 41:24.385
It's one of Dad's.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.187
I found it at the house on the roof.

41:27.310 --> 41:29.142
It was hidden inside a vent.

41:30.110 --> 41:31.316
Hey, be careful.

41:32.650 --> 41:33.731
It's the last one.

41:35.110 --> 41:35.941
What...

41:36.070 --> 41:39.199
What were you doing at the house

41:40.120 --> 41:42.748
That's... It's a long story.

41:43.910 --> 41:45.742
The Lodge sort of...

41:46.540 --> 41:48.372
led me to it, so--

41:48.500 --> 41:49.490
Good for you.

41:50.630 --> 41:52.701
-Hey, what's the matter with you?
-Nothing.

41:53.010 --> 41:54.330
Just a long day.

41:56.220 --> 41:57.210
OK.

41:58.550 --> 41:59.540
You know what, Liz?

42:00.180 --> 42:03.172
I'm just gonna give you
a little advice, OK?

42:04.940 --> 42:06.260
You need to quit your job.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.852
Quit. Really?

42:09.810 --> 42:11.392
You're gonna pick up the slack?

42:11.520 --> 42:14.820
Yeah. I mean, I'll get more
aggressive with Temp Joy.

42:14.950 --> 42:18.409
And I just refinanced my loan
with Burt, and the Lodge is--

42:18.530 --> 42:22.319
Do you understand
how completely delusional you are?

42:22.830 --> 42:25.538
Do you understand
how completely miserable you are?

42:25.660 --> 42:28.914
You get to live in a nice little
bubble, and I get to pay for it.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.701
I pay for everything!

42:30.840 --> 42:32.626
All you care about is money!
That's it!

42:32.750 --> 42:35.799
Well, someone has to! You never will.
You are just like Dad.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.503
I hope I am, because he was
the best guy that I ever met!

42:38.930 --> 42:41.137
He knew how to enjoy life.
He was happy.

42:41.260 --> 42:43.422
You know,
that's your biggest delusion of all.

42:43.560 --> 42:45.130
Really -Dad was faking it.

42:45.980 --> 42:48.472
The debt had been crushing him
for years. Years!

42:48.600 --> 42:51.012
He couldn't deal with it,
so he decides to check out.

42:51.150 --> 42:53.278
Jesus Christ, Liz! He drowned!

42:53.400 --> 42:55.232
No, he knew exactly
what he was doing.

42:55.360 --> 42:58.990
He body-surfed every day of his life.
You actually think he drowned?

42:59.110 --> 43:02.023
I don't know what happened out there.
Maybe he had a heart attack.

43:02.160 --> 43:05.824
He could have gotten caught in a rip.
Maybe... he got attacked by a shark.

43:05.950 --> 43:07.247
-I don't know!
-A shark?

43:07.370 --> 43:10.533
You'll believe anything as long as
you don't have to face the truth!

43:10.670 --> 43:12.581
Dad wanted to die, Dud.

43:12.920 --> 43:15.662
He killed himself!
And deep down, you know it!

43:16.630 --> 43:18.041
-Take it back.
-Get off me.

43:18.170 --> 43:19.877
-Take it back now!
-No!

43:20.760 --> 43:22.797
-Get off me!
-God!

43:24.180 --> 43:25.170
God, get off me!

43:25.310 --> 43:26.300
No!

43:26.430 --> 43:27.420
Get off!

43:53.500 --> 43:54.877
You were wrong about Dad.

43:56.130 --> 43:57.416
He didn't want to die.

44:00.930 --> 44:02.000
But you do.

44:21.150 --> 44:23.312
Hey, Dud,
don't worry about your foot.

44:23.450 --> 44:24.565
I'm gonna fix it.

44:25.080 --> 44:28.653
I had a crisis of faith, but now
I feel like anything's possible.

44:53.940 --> 44:57.183
And we will end this invocation with
the words of Thomas Norton.

44:58.190 --> 45:01.945
"No man therefore
may reach this great present,

45:02.070 --> 45:06.234
but he who hath virtue excellent."

45:13.250 --> 45:18.165
Please stand in honor of our
