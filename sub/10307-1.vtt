02:38.449 --> 02:42.000
Opening day at Wrigley, and
oh, what a sight!

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
The diamond, the decorations, 
and the dread of yet another losing season.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.500
[sparks crackling] 
Ah! Ugh! Ernie! It's fritzing out again.

02:52.500 --> 02:56.500
You were supposed to fix this thing,
will you hurry up? Will you hustle? Hustle, hustle!

02:56.500 --> 02:59.000
- Somebody get me a coffee please. What?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
- Mr. Murdoch!

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
I think this is gonna be THE
season for the Cubs.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
You think this is gonna be the season?
Why would you think that?

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
We haven't won a pennant since '45
and a series since the... the...

03:07.500 --> 03:09.000
-1908, I know.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
-1908!

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
-I just have this feeling.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
-You have a feeling. He's got a feeling! Cancel the coffee!
Get me whatever he's drinking! He's got a feeling about the uh...

03:14.700 --> 03:17.000
-We're on the air!

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
-Eeuh! We're on the air, live! I'm Cliff Murdoch...

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
[crowd cheers]

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
David Pierce will be facing giant
Ledolph great, Clight Kyle!

03:26.500 --> 03:29.000
10 bucks says Kyle knocks it
out of the park.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Alright.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
And there's the first pitch of the season!

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Ooh! Kyle got a hold of that pigeon enough!
It's going back! Back!

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
Ah! Has he got the distance?
It's going! Going! Going!

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Rowengartner makes the grab! Unbelievable!

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
C'mon, Henry!

03:57.500 --> 04:00.000
-Hurry up!
-Watch out! [laughter]

04:02.500 --> 04:06.000
-Wait up guys!
-C'mon, George, you're gonna wreck it!

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
-[laughter]

04:07.500 --> 04:10.000
-C'mon, guys!

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
-Good luck today, Henry!

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
-Thanks, Mr. Banks!

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
-What's in the baby carriage?

04:12.500 --> 04:14.000
-A baby!

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
A baby?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Woah! [laughter]

04:18.500 --> 04:22.000
Hang on, hey! Coming through!
[laughter]

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Hey, not so fast!

04:28.500 --> 04:30.000
Where do you think you're going?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
-Mom!

04:30.000 --> 04:32.500
-Hello George. Hello Clark.

04:32.500 --> 04:36.500
-I got a game!
-Yeah, Henry thinks that he's actually gonna play today.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.000
David Rosenthal starts Hebrew school this week.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Well, it would be great if you got to play,
but honey, if you don't...

04:43.500 --> 04:45.000
-Yeah?

04:44.500 --> 04:48.000
-I'm gonna let you do the laundry when we get home.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
-[sigh] You're too kind, mom.
(to the boys) Come on!

04:50.500 --> 04:52.000
Have fun!

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
-Your mom is so cool.
-Yeah, she's alright.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.000
Hey! Wait, wait.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.000
Sunblock!

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
[dramatic music]

05:06.500 --> 05:08.000
[soft thud]

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
-Nice catch, Henry.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
-Yup! You're gonna get a LOT of playing time.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
He's gotta put me in! It's either me or Windemere!

05:14.000 --> 05:18.300
-[sneezing]
-Windemere! Windemere! Windemere!

05:18.300 --> 05:22.000
What's wrong with him? Are you a moron?
You imbecile.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Time out, now, time out!
Rowengartner, get in the right field!

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Windemere, you come on in here!

05:35.300 --> 05:39.000
Yeah Henry! Come on Henry, let's go!

05:36.500 --> 05:39.000
-Yeah!

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Oh my gosh!

05:41.700 --> 05:43.700
I can't believe they're letting him play!

05:43.700 --> 05:48.000
Hustle on into the tunnel, and I don't wanna
hear about no asthma neither!

05:46.600 --> 05:48.000
[sneezing]

05:49.000 --> 05:52.800
Alright, chuck it in there, baby! Chuck it!
Chuck it in there, baby, come on!

05:52.800 --> 05:57.500
Okay, Deezer, let 'er rip! Throw in the chedder!
Come on, right in the kitchen!

05:57.500 --> 06:00.300
Come on! Get in the big, high, stinky...

06:00.300 --> 06:03.000
Would you shut up?

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Chuck it in there, baby! Bring it on, baby! Bring it! Bring it to me,
show 'em what you got! Chuck it in there! He's got nothing! He's got something!

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
It's yours! It's yours!

06:12.500 --> 06:14.000
-I got it!

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
-Go back!

06:15.500 --> 06:17.000
I got it!

06:16.500 --> 06:19.000
-Come on!
-You can catch it!

06:17.500 --> 06:19.000
-I got it!

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Oh! 
[heavy breathing]

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Get it, get it!

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Heh? Huh! Come on!

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
[heavy breathing]

06:29.300 --> 06:31.000
Huh? Oh!

06:34.500 --> 06:37.000
Turn around! Home! Home!

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Is that play legal?

06:51.500 --> 06:55.000
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
-How was game?
-[indistinct grunt]

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Well, what does that mean?
Did you get to play?

07:01.500 --> 07:04.000
-They put me in right field.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
-So how'd you do?
-Let's just say I made the play of the day.

07:07.500 --> 07:11.000
-That bad, huh?
-I can't even catch a fly ball!

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
So? Maybe you're not cut out to be an outfielder.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
-Maybe you should be a pitcher. Like your father was.
-In my dreams.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Hey, hey!

07:22.500 --> 07:25.000
-Laundry.
-[sigh] Mom.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
-(imitating) Mom.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
[sigh]

07:43.500 --> 07:46.500
What's this?

07:46.500 --> 07:50.000
The Cubs are bringing in their right fielder to pitch?
[imitates cheering]

07:50.500 --> 07:58.000
(echoing) Henry Rowengartner! The entire season is
resting on Rowengartner's shoulders!

07:58.500 --> 08:05.000
Bottom nine. Two out. One on. Full count.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
Rowengartner takes a long look at the runner at second.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.000
[thud]
Strike one!

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
-Honey, dinner's almost ready.
-You're going out again?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah.
You gonna be okay?

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
-[sigh] What's the occasion?
-It's our three week anniversary.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.500
Three weeks? congratulations.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.500
-(background) Hello? Anyone there? Mary?
-What have you got against Jack?

08:33.500 --> 08:35.000
He's moving too fast!

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
-Shh.
-Henry! Hey!

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
Now the three week anniversary is the, um...
That's the necklace anniversary.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Oh, Jack! Uh... (laughs)

08:48.000 --> 08:51.500
-Oh, Jack, this, uh...
-Let me get that on you.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.000
This is too much.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
-[sigh]
-[kissing noises]

08:57.500 --> 09:03.000
-Thank you.
-[smooching]

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
Okay, uh, honey? In bed by 8:30
and do all your homework. 

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
-[kiss]
-[imitates buzzer]

09:13.700 --> 09:18.000
-You're gonna love this restaurant, Mary.
-[door closes]

09:22.500 --> 09:26.000
-I think Henry is really starting to like me!
-Um, yeah.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
-[sigh]
Oh Mom. That Jack Bradfield. 

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
[school bell rings]

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
[chatter]

09:55.500 --> 09:59.000
-Hi Clark.
-Hi Edith.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.500
-Why don't you talk to Vicky Freiger?
-We have nothing in common!

10:11.500 --> 10:13.500
So?

10:13.500 --> 10:16.000
So, what are we gonna talk about?

10:16.000 --> 10:24.500
-Talk about the boat! Her dad has a boat! We have a boat!
-We don't have a boat! We have wood. In the big shape of a boat.

10:24.500 --> 10:28.500
Camry Hero told me that Becky Freiger doesn't think
you're very ugly.

10:28.500 --> 10:33.000
Forget it guys! She doesn't like me! And besides,
she's not that hot.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Not that hot? 
She's that!

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Just look at her sipping that milk.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Milk's done that body good. 

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Hey look! There's Becky and Tiffany!

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
-Hi!
-Hey, Rowengartner!

10:58.500 --> 11:02.000
Good game yesterday.
[laughter]

11:03.500 --> 11:07.000
Don't worry about it. I mean, that kid's a dork anyways.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Hey, Rowengartner!

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Catch!

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
[dramatic music]

12:06.500 --> 12:13.000
-Radial fractures of the olnum. Assorted rotator cartilage damage.
-How long does he have to be in the cast?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.500
August. Minimum.

12:15.500 --> 12:21.000
-August? That's like four months.
-Henry has to take it easy. I want those bones to set correctly.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
[sigh] This is gonna be a great summer.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.000
[giggling]

12:36.300 --> 12:40.000
Hi Henry! Bye Henry!

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Hurry!

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
-Come on, let's go! Come on Mom! Come on!
-Alright, okay!

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
-[tires screech]
-Thank you!
-Wait, wait, come on! Let's go!

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
The bone is fine. But the tendons have fused with the humerus. 

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
[giggling]

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
-Is that bad?
-It's unusual. Uh, let's take a look. Okay, 
let's start with the fingers.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
-Good, good. Now raise the arm. 
-[creaking]

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
-Good, good. Now to the side.
-[more creaking]

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
-Good. Uh, now bend at the elbow.
-[more creaking]

13:41.000 --> 13:47.000
-Good, good. Now rotate from the shoulder, slowly.
-[more creaking]

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
-[snaps]
-Oh! [yelling]
-Woah!

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
-Oh!
-[blows nose] Funky butt-lovin'!

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
-Did he say "funky butt-lovin'"?
-[laughter]

13:58.500 --> 14:02.500
-I'm sorry! I don't know what happened!
-Are-Are you alright?

14:02.500 --> 14:09.000
I, I, uh... I think what's happened here is that 
those tendons have healed, uh, a little tight.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
-I've never seen anything quite like that.
-I'm really sorry.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
-Go. Please. Just, uh, just go.
-Let's go, come on. Uh, you guys, let's go. Quickly! Quickly! Come on!

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
-I am so sorry.
-What'd you hit on the nose for?

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
Hey, uh, I'm gonna wanna see you on, uh, three weeks.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Right, okay. Thank you!

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Nurse?

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
-Come on!
-Here!

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
-What's this?
-Happy cast-off day.
-What is it?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
-Cubs tickets!
-[screaming]

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
We're going to the Cubs game! We're going to the Cubs game!

14:57.000 --> 15:05.000
-Woah, gosh, it's huge!
-Man, look how great it is!
-Wow, Wrigley Field! This is great!

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
[heavy breathing]

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
-You think they'll pull it out today?
-Definitely! They got Steadman on the mount!

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
-Alright!
-[growling]

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
-[booing]

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
-Come on, Rocket, throw the heat!

15:33.000 --> 15:41.000
-Throw it back! Throw it back! Throw it back!
I don't know, they're saying it!

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Bleacher rules - you can't keep a home run hit by the other team.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Throw it back! Throw it back!

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
-[laughter]
-I can throw better than that.

15:53.000 --> 16:00.000
Well that's gonna bring Rocket's earned-run average
to about .300 or so. Which equals the attendance here today.

16:00.000 --> 16:08.000
-What a team.
-Poor Mr. Carson. His last season as team owner. He must be really depressed.

16:08.000 --> 16:17.000
[yelling] Bob! Fish! Fish! Look! A decoder ring! I got it out
of the Cracker Jack box! It fits on your finger like...

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
-Great! Man is turning into a cracker jack.
Okay, Uncle Bob!

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
Come on, what is this? Get the game going! What's going on!

16:29.000 --> 16:37.000
Uh, if we don't sell out every game for the rest of the season,
we are going to, uh, have to forfeit the franchise.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
-Forfeit the franchise? Just when I'm about to take over the team?
No money, no team?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
[sigh] We need a miracle, sir. 

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
Throw him the cheese! Throw him the high! 
Stinky! Lipburger!

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
[chanting] Rocket! Rocket! Rocket!
[cheering]

17:06.000 --> 17:14.000
-Woah!
-Yes! We got it! Yes! Yes!

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
[chanting] Throw it back! Throw it back!

17:23.000 --> 17:32.000
-Wait a sec! This game is on cable! Here.
-Sure, I'll throw it and get harrassed. Here Henry, you throw it!

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
Okay. Here goes!
[rubber band sounds]

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Oh my god.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
-Safe!
-Did you see that? Woah!

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
Somebody just threw a frozen rope from the bleachers to home point!
That's gotta be 435 feet.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.000
Durkin! Bring me that arm!

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
-Hey kid! Hey!
-What the hell was that?

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
Huh? I'm sorry! I didn't mean it! My tendons! They're too tight!

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
-What's your name, kid?
-Henry.
-Shut up George!

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
-You trying to show me up, Henry?
-No! Come on guys, let's get out of here!

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
-He'd kill you.
-Thanks.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
I just figured out why the Cubs lose every year.
They got more talent in the stand than they do in the field.
Who threw that?

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
-Did you find him?
-Oh, no, he left already.
-Well, did you get a name?

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
-Henry. But... but... nobody in the bleachers...
-Henry what? How are we gonna find him?

18:51.000 --> 18:58.000
-Sir. This Henry is just a child.
-What do you mean a child, what... What do you mean a child?

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
-He's a child. He's a short, little, young person,
he's 10-11 years old!

19:04.000 --> 19:12.000
Take this business very seriously! If you are joking,
I swear you're gonna end up selling weiners! In the nose bleed section!

19:12.000 --> 19:30.000
-Not joking, sir. Really, this Henry's just a kid.
-Kid?... Kid? Excellent. Find him.

19:36.000 --> 19:45.000
-Rowengartner checks the runners. And the pitch.
-[car honks] Hi, honey!

19:45.000 --> 19:52.000
-Mom, watch this!
-Wait! [screaming]
[glass breaks]

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
Gosh Henry! You could play for the Cubs!

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
It's incredible! A real child with the Cubs? He's gonna be thrilled!
Thank you Mr. Fisher!

20:08.000 --> 20:16.000
-I am worried about Henry. This arm thing is weird!
-This arm thing is fantastic! Cheers.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
-What's with you? 
-Nothing.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
[door bell]
[panting]

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
-Hello son. I'm looking for Henry Rule-inverter.
-Henry Rowengarter?

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
-Yeah. Is he here?
-I'm Henry.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
-I must be looking for your father.
-My dad?

20:46.000 --> 20:57.000
[car honks] Woo! Yoo! Hey, ho! Here we go, here we go!
Sorry I'm late. 

20:59.000 --> 21:07.000
Salmart Miller, right? Jack Bradfield. I am a huge, huge fan.
Come here Henry.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
Henry, this is Salmart Miller, the manager of the Chicago Cubs.
[gasp]

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
And this is Henry Rowengartner. The next Nolan Ryan!

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
-Jack. He is a golden goose.
-This kid's incredible!

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
-Just a think of the possibilities, Jack! A 12 year old kid
playing in the major leagues!
-Yeah, I know.

21:41.000 --> 21:49.000
-Wow!
-You are going to be his manager.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
-And managers, Jack, get 10%.
-10%?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
One more. 

21:57.000 --> 22:04.000
-All we gotta do is get the contract signed.
-Well that's no problem.

22:06.000 --> 22:17.000
-Hey kid! How would you like to pitch for the Chicago Cubs?
-Great! But I gotta ask my mom first.
-He's gotta ask his mom first.

22:19.000 --> 22:26.000
Excuse me. Honey, just keep - ouch! Jack! You didn't tell me
it was gonna be such a circle! 

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
-Oh I didn't know! Stop worrying, it's just part of the game!
-It's gonna be great, mom!

22:30.000 --> 22:37.000
-Mrs. Rowengartner, Larry Fisher, great news! Great news! 
I got Pespsi, Kellogg, and Reebok foaming at the mouth for a piece of the kid!
-Which piece?

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
Henry! [foreign language]

22:58.000 --> 23:12.000
-Hey, hey, hey, who are you?
-I'm uh, Jack Bradfield. Henry's manager. What? Didn't I tell you?

23:12.000 --> 23:19.000
-The question is, can you pitch?
-Um, well, my dad used to play!
-Semi-pro, pro?

23:19.000 --> 23:26.000
-I'm not sure. But he was a pitcher.
-[groans] Henry! How about you? Any experience?

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
-Well I play little league for the Fivers, right field.
-Hey look it's Rowengartner!

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
Carson! Carson! We've all seen these publicity stunts before.
How do we not know Henry is just here to sell tickets?

23:45.000 --> 23:53.000
-Alright. I will.
-Wait, wait, wait. You wanna see him pitch? Come out to Wrigley.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
[screaming]

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
-Oh, wow!
-Woah!
-Woah!

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
-Come on!
-Hey, wait, wait! Wait!

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
-You ready?
-Can't we just say goodbye here?

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
-No, I wanna make sure you get in okay.
-None of the other Cub moms are gonna be there.

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
Okay. You got too big on me.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.000
-Bye. Have a great game.
-Hey hey hey.
-Okay, okay! I'll see you guys up there.
-See you Mrs. Rowengartner.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
[knocking]

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
-Autographs after the game.
-Wait! I'm Henry Rowengartner!

25:03.000 --> 25:12.000
Well, why didn't you say so? Oh, that's a horse of a different color!
Come on in!

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
-Come on in!
-Come on guys!

25:21.000 --> 25:29.000
-Can't come in here! Players only! And the locker rooms
are right at the end of the hall.
-Goodbye! Bye!

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
[chattering]

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
-Hi!
-[chattering stops]

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
I'm Henry Rowengartner! I'm the new pitcher!

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
[chattering continues]

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Wow! Stan Olkie!

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
Oh my god, it's Billy Frick!

26:13.000 --> 26:24.000
Ched Steadman? Unbelievable! Mr. Steadman! Can I have your autograph?
Could you sign it "Rocket?"

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
[growling] I don't do autographs.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
Raven-booser. Your locker's over here.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Brigma. 

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
That's Phil Brigma. Pitting coach. I beamed him in the minor leagues
and he's been following me around ever since. Brigma, this is Henry.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
-Hi Henry!
-Nice to meet you Mr. Brigma.
-Welcome to the big show! 

26:58.000 --> 27:08.000
Now, I'll tell you what I want! You're gonna take a lot of sweat!
But eventually, I'm gonna mold you into one of the greatest 12 year olds

27:08.000 --> 27:15.000
that's ever played this game! Now! [choking]

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
[high pitch] Suit up! I'll see you out there!

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Wow!

27:41.000 --> 27:50.000
[dark music]

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Yes!

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
[crowd cheers]

28:44.000 --> 28:52.000
-Wow! Look at all these people!
-Sell out! Jack! We're one for one.

28:52.000 --> 28:05.000
Well, mark it down folks! August 11th! 12 year old Henry Rowengartner
steps in front of 35,000 fans in Wrigly Field to become the
youngest person to ever play in Major League Baseball!

29:05.000 --> 20:10.000
Okay, baby! Put it right in this kitchen! Go to work! Come on, baby! 

29:10.000 --> 29:19.000
-Yes, Rocket! Alright! Come on! Put it right in this kitchen! 
Yeah! Alright! Do the dew!
-[growling] Gosh.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
Give him the cheese! The high! Stinky! Chedder!

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
[crowd groans]

29:43.000 --> 29:49.000
You are a bum, Steadman! Get him out!

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Hey!

29:59.000 --> 30:06.000
You're in my seat. Pitchers over there.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Hey!

30:15.000 --> 30:22.000
-[phone rings]
-Yeah.
-Put the kid in.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
-The kid?
-Put in what's-his-name, Henry!

30:25.000 --> 30:32.000
-Look, he's not ready, Fish!
-I don't care. We got a sell-out crowd and they're not here
to see Chet Steadman. Now!

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
Rosen-burger. Warm up. You're going in.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
[crowd boos]

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
-Safe!
-[more booing]
-Safe! He's safe!

31:03.000 --> 31:09.000
-I'm sticking a fork in him. He's done. Call in Henry.
-Right.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
[chanting] We want Henry! We want Henry!

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
What's Mr. Brigma doing?

31:24.000 --> 31:30.000
That's the signal kid. You're in.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
I'm in? I'm in?

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
[chanting] Henry! Henry!

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
[crowd cheers]

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
Henry is so cute!

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
[dramatic thud]

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
[crowd cheering]

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
[crowd booing]

33:17.000 --> 33:24.000
Let's go kid! Where's your mom sitting? This one's for mommy! Mommy!

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Honey!

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
-Oh no!
-[crowd gasps]

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
-Read em and weep, kid.
-[groaning]

34:00.000 --> 34:08.000
-[crowd boos]
-Boohoohoo! Boohoohoo! Haha!

34:08.000 --> 34:15.000
-Waa! Waa! What, are you kidding me? I eat fastballs for breakfast!
-Get you next time.
-Yeah! That's right!

34:15.000 --> 34:21.000
-Oh, he must feel so horrible!
-That's alright. In Chicago we get used to this kind of thing. 

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
[crowd cheers]

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
[coughing]

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
[rubberband sounds]

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Sorry!

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
Ooh! That stings!

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
-Come on! Come on!
-It's okay, honey!

35:00.000 --> 35:07.000
-This is a joke.
-Come on, kid!

35:10.000 --> 35:17.000
-You gotta take me out. I can't do this!
-That's not my call, kid. Just rock and fire! Come on, let's go.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
Hey come on, kid, throw the heat!

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
[crowd cheering]

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
You don't have a chance.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
-Oh no!
-It's a wild pitch, a very wild pitch!

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
Wight's on his horse! He's headed for third!

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
Out!

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
Richard nails Wight for the final out and the Cubs go on to win!

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
Alright Henry! Way to go Henry!

36:04.000 --> 36:13.000
Rowengartner throws a homer, hits a man, throws a wild pitch,
and still manage to get the save, and the Chicago Cubs
beat the New York Mets 5 to 4.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
-You're gonna have to teach him.
-Teach him what?
-To pitch.

36:17.000 --> 36:22.000
-I'm not playing wet nurse to no 12 year old.
-You're not playing much of anything these days.

36:22.000 --> 36:28.000
-Brigma is the pitching coach.
-Now! Key to being a big league pitcher is the three R's.

36:28.000 --> 36:36.000
Readiness, recuperation, conditioning. You see, after the game,
a lot of guys like to ice up their arms.

36:36.000 --> 36:43.000
Still other fellas think that heat is the way to go.
But I discovered the secret, Henry.

36:44.000 --> 36:53.000
Hot ice. That's right, hot ice! I heat up the ice cubes!
It's the best of both worlds!

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Hi Henry!

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
Come on, sit here! Come on!

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
-Come on.
-I'm not sitting over there.
-Why?

37:10.000 --> 37:16.000
Don't worry about it. It'll be fine. They're just girls.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
-Hi!
-Hey.

37:20.000 --> 37:26.000
-How's it going?
-Okay.
-Good. Good. Good.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
-George, dont.
-Hi, Tiffany.
-Hi Roger.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
-How's it going?
-Not bad.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
-She called you Roger.
-So?

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
-Uh, you having meatloaf?
-Meatloaf?

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
-You hear that Jimmy Rogers got a pencil stuck up his nose?
-No, I didn't hear that.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
-They had to use pliers. 
-Ow.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
-Yeah, the eraser's still up there.
-That's pretty nasty.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
-What's that thing Clark's carrying around?
-Oh, it's something for this boat we're working on.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
-You have a boat?
-Yeah. Kind of.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
-We have a boat but I always have to ride it with my parents.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
-Oh.
-Tell her to take it for a ride. Ask her to go for a ride!

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
[bell rings]

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
-Well, see you.
-Bye Roger.
-Bye!

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
-Man, you were this close!
-When the boat's done I'll ask her!

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
-Woah!
-You sure your dad said it was alright?

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Let's just work on the boat.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Do not crash it please!

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
-Yes, okay go get me a screwdriver.
-Okay, which one?

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
-Uh, flathead. That little one right there!

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
-Hurry!
-Oh man, I'm gonna be late for practice!

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
-Go, go, go, dig it out, dig it out!

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
[groans]

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
Let me show you how that's done, alright?

39:39.000 --> 39:44.000
Chin down! Eye on the ball! Now, bring it to me!

39:47.000 --> 39:57.000
See what I did there? Huh? You see that? Alright. Now. Give me the good stuff.

40:01.000 --> 40:10.000
Ooh. Third time's a charm. Let the big dog eat!

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
[clunk]

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
You're gonna be working with Steadman today.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Hi guys!

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
By the way, you're fined $500 for showing up late to practice. 

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
$500? That's like 6 years of allowance!

40:39.000 --> 40:45.000
-[elastic sounds]
-Hmm.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
-[elastic sounds]
-[booing]

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
[chanting] We want Henry! We want Henry!

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
Garden-hoser!

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
-They're sending Henry in!
-Yeah, we're gonna go sit closer so we can see better.

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
-Come on, let's go get seats.
-The seats? You mean, uh, down on the P-level? No, no, no, please.
That's too dangerous.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
-Why?
-Me? The owner of the Cubs sitting down with the fans? They'd kill me.
-You're right.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
-Oh, don't tell me they're bringing in-
-[chanting] Henry! Henry!

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
[cheering]

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
Well, after a shaky outing yesterday, 'Mart Mill is showing
confidence in the rookie by bringing him in.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
I gotta be out of my mind.

41:49.000 --> 41:57.000
We at Pepsi really think that Henry could the choice of a new generation!
If Henry can show Pepsi he's a winner, we'll sign him.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
-Oof!
-Oh god!

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
[crowd boos]

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
-Ow!
-Take your base!
-Sorry!

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
-It's okay.
-Betcha that hurt.
-Here we go again.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
-Go talk to him, Chet. Please.
-What do you want me to say?

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
You've been working with him. Talk to him.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
Oh jeez.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
-Oh man! He gets to talk to Ched Steadman!
-Woah, what a lucky guy!

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
Don't listen to him, Hank, he's a loser!

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
-What are you doing out here?
-Well, what am I supposed to do?

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
-Deal from your have-to.
-My-my wh-wh-wh-what? What are you-
-The have-to.

42:45.000 --> 42:51.000
-Are you speaking English?
-The have-to is what you use when you're afraid.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
-Okay.
-Okay, you got it? Listen to me.

42:54.000 --> 43:00.000
-Everybody is half-win and half-lose. Lose half is afraid. 
-Right.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
-The winning half is fearless.
-Fearless. Right.

43:03.000 --> 43:10.000
-The have-to is inside. It's where the fear lives.
-Oh, okay. Could you start over again?
-Let's play ball!

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
-The have-to. Let's see it.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
-The have-to. What the heck was I talking about?
-What the heck was he talking about?

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
-So, what'd you tell him?
-You wouldn't understand.

43:33.000 --> 43:41.000
-Come on, kid, earn your paycheck!
-Just breathe, baby, come on!

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
Oh no!

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
-You're out! You're out!
-Yes! You got it!

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
What a sweet little double play that was!

44:00.000 --> 44:10.000
-Hey! Hey. Way to pitch.
-Huh?

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
That's two!

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Cool!

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
And believe it or not, Henry's one out away from back to back saves!

44:26.000 --> 44:33.000
Alright Hank! Cut some cheese, bud! Cut some big, stinky cheese!

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
-Strike!
-Yeah!

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
He throws a strike for the first time in his professional career!

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
-Hey! Hey!
-Here you go, kid, here you go, here you go!

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
-You lookin' good, man, keep lookin' good!
-Come on now, let's settle down, let's settle down, son!

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
-Strike two!
-[whistling]

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
Boy that had some heat on it.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
Alright, bring him out of there now!

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
-[chanting] Henry! Henry!
-Finish him off, Hank, we get the Pepsi contract!

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
-Go, Henry, come on!
-Clean his nose!

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
-Strike three!

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
-Yeah!
-Yes! Yes! Yeah!

45:42.000 --> 45:49.000
Hey! You see that kid? I never doubted him for a minute!
Hey! Way to go, Rottle-mocker!

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
Cha-ching, Jack.

46:00.000 --> 46:06.000
And with that, Rowengartner extends the Cubs to their longest winning streak this season - two.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
Hey! Rowengartner! You suck!

46:48.000 --> 46:53.000
-Come on down guys! I got outfield!
-I'm batting!
-That makes me pitcher!

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
-Think they'll let us play?
-[laughter]

47:26.000 --> 47:31.000
-Hi. I'm Henry's mom.
-Hi, Henry's mom.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
-Oh, I'm sorry. It's Mary, I'm Mary.
-Hi Mary, I'm Chet.
-I know.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
Thanks for whatever you said to him out there.

47:55.000 --> 48:02.000
He's a good kid. He must have a heck of a mom.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
[laughs]

48:19.000 --> 48:25.000
-Excuse me! Excuse me! Come on! Don't worry, Mrs. Rowengartner,
we'll take good care of him!
-Do everything Mr. Brigma says, honey, I love you!

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
-See you in 10 days!
-Bye!
-Don't forget to eat your vegetables!

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
-Get plenty of rest!
-Sunscreen!

48:33.000 --> 48:45.000
-Hey! Your mom's got a pretty good arm! I didn't see the floater
pitch since Scuffy McGee! Bye! So long!
-Bye!

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
Let's go back to our dull lives in search for meaning.

48:50.000 --> 48:59.000
Baseball is 162 grueling games played in a more than a dozen cities. 
Now on the field, we conserve our energy.

48:59.000 --> 49:08.000
-On the road, we conserve our food.
-Food?
-Everywhere we go, there's free food. This steak, for example!

49:08.000 --> 49:20.000
Now, I wrap it up in my vomit bag, I take it back to the hotel,
put it on ice, and in the morning, voila! Breakfast!

49:20.000 --> 49:25.000
Conservation, Henry! Managing resources! That is the key to baseball!

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
Brigma!

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
I'll be right back.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Hey rookie. Come here.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
-Have a seat. What'd you get?
-Chicken fingers.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
-How are they?
-Good. How about you?

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
-One of the best Salisbury steaks I've ever had in my life.
You want some?
-Sure.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
Thanks for signing that baseball.

49:47.000 --> 50:00.000
Do me a favor. Don't call me Rocket.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
-Why?
-Because I'm not the Rocket anymore

50:03.000 --> 50:08.000
-Yeah I don't get it, you're throwing so slow.
-Well, thank you very much.

50:08.000 --> 50:15.000
-No, no, no, I mean, didn't surgery fix your shoulder?
-I don't know what my shoulder will do if I heat it up again.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
-This is your room Mr. Rowengartner.
-We get our own rooms?

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
-Yep!
-This is great!

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
Well, if you need anything, I'll be right next door. Okay?

50:41.000 --> 50:47.000
-[knocks]
-Sorry, your door seems to be malfunctioning. I'll get housekeeping up here.
-Thank you!

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
Nice guy.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
-The bus leaves at 11:00 sharp.
-11:00, I'll be there.

50:55.000 --> 51:00.000
Punctuality, Henry. Without it, time stands still.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
Alright!

51:04.000 --> 51:11.000
You found out where she lives? Well, did she say anything about me?
No, really.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
I mean, I gotta go. Bye.

51:26.000 --> 51:33.000
[knocks] Henry?
[knocks] Henry.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
Oh boy.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
Oh boy. 
[knocks]

51:45.000 --> 51:50.000
Little help. Little help now.

51:50.000 --> 52:00.000
September in Chevaz Ravine, Los Angeles, California.
Our beloved Cubbies are just three games behind the New York Mets,
with 15 games left to play.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
Yes!

52:07.000 --> 52:13.000
-Billy, how's your hand?
-It stinks.
-Did you hear that? You made his hand stink. You were throwing...

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
-Hey big guy, you good for another inning?
-You betcha, Sallie-baby.

52:18.000 --> 52:23.000
-Good, you're on deck.
-Huh?
-You're up after Fern.
-Huh.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
-You can't let him bat.
-He's gotta learn sometime.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
Sweet meat pies, Rowengartner's going to bat.
Oh, I hope that little feller knows what he's doing.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
-Stay low.
-Yeah, and?
-And don't get killed.

52:42.000 --> 52:48.000
You're on. Oh, just take one bat, one bat. [groan] Stay low.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
He's throwing BB's today, man.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
Show em what you got, kid.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
They're gonna let him bat?

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
[crowd cheering]

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
Put it in my wheelhouse.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
Come on, give me something I can hit.

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
Just step in the box, son. Step up to the plate.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
-Oh my god, oh my god.
-Oh my god, oh my god.
-Oh my god, oh my god.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
-Ahh!
-Ball!

53:52.000 --> 53:57.000
-You almost killed him, you stupid mother-
-of God in heaven!

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
-Hey, brush me back!
-Just cool it!

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
Play ball.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
-Oh my god, oh my god.
-Oh my god, oh my god.
-Oh my god, oh my god.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
-Ahh!
-Ball!

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
He's got no strike zone!

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
-You big, ugly piece of-
-sit!

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
-Hang in there, hang in there Henry!
-Come on, Henry, you're alright!

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
No!

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Ball! 3-0!

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
Call strikes! Who cares how short he is. Let's go.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
-Powder it, Hank!
-Keep your eyes open, stay low!

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
All four! Take your base!

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
-Take my base?
-Come on, he swung at the ball!
-Alright!

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
-[crowd boo's]
-Woah!
-Alright, there you go!

55:03.000 --> 55:08.000
-Hank took a rip at that one, but the ump had already made the call,
and he's on his way to first.

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
-Alright, alright, I'll buy that.
-He got on base! Oh my god, he got on base.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
Is this gonna take much longer?

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
Let's go, Suarez.

55:26.000 --> 55:32.000
Hey, pitcher!
[singing] Pitcher, pitcher, pitcher!

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
What are you doing?

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
Hey pitcher! You got something hanging out of your nose!

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
-Safe!
-He hit him too hard!

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
-He was just trying to make the tag!
-Hey.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
-Can't get me.
-Safe.
-Can't get me.

55:51.000 --> 55:57.000
-Hey, kid.
-Safe.
-Close!

56:04.000 --> 56:10.000
Pitcher, pitcher, pitcher!
[singing] Pitcher's got a big butt!

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Go!

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
-Rowengartner going for second!
-Go, go!

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
Slide, slide!

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
Safe!

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
-Yeah!
-Yes!

56:37.000 --> 56:42.000
Pitcher! [singing] Nanny, nanny, nanny! You can't get me!

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
This game is making me crazy!

56:45.000 --> 56:50.000
-Hey, we want a pitcher, not an underwear snitcher!
-Get back!

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
-Hey!
[crowd boo's]
-Kringo Rynell hit Suarez in the back!

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
That one's for you kid.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
Easy kid.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
[singing] Nanny, nanny, nanny.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
Woah.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
-Andele! Andele!
-Oh.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
-They're running!
-Run, run, run!
-Faster, faster, faster!

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
-Move it! Move it!
-This is as fast as I go!

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
-Safe! Safe!
-Yeah!

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
-Alright!
-Woah!

57:41.000 --> 57:48.000
-This kid can do it all!
-Yeah! Woo! Yes!
-Yes! Yes!

58:53.000 --> 58:58.000
-Chet! Is this your one opportunity to go? How's it going to go now?
-Hey, we're the Cubs. You never know.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
-How does it feel to be out-pitched by a 12 year old?
-I don't care who out-pitches me, so long as we get the ring. 

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
-Henry? Henry!
-Mom!

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
Coming through! Coming through! Hot coffee! Hot coffee!

59:43.000 --> 59:49.000
-Just drop me off at the next terminal. I'll get a cab.
-No way. We'll take you home.

59:49.000 --> 59:55.000
-That's okay.
-No, no, really, I mean we have this whole huge limosine that
Mr. Fisher gave us. I'm sure the driver will give you a ride home.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
Well, thanks. Thanks a lot.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
-[laughter]
-Hey, hey, how about a cocktail?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
-Oh, please.
-Alright. Club soda?
-Please.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
-Alright. How about you?
-Where'd you learn to do this?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
DeBrobe, babe. How about you?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
-Clube soda, babe.
-Okay.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:44.000
[radio] Love is lovelier the second time around.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000
-Henry, what are you doing?
-Nothing! I happen to like this music.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
-He's turning into a regular social giant.
-Uh-huh.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
-Where'd she go?
-Nothing like a little pennant-fever to get the juices going!

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:21.000
-Mr. Carson sure can throw a party!
-Welcome to life in the fast lane, Henry! It's a road less traveled!

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Sometimes, you just gotta put the petal to the metal and just...
live the fantasy! Rock and roll!

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:41.000
-Oh, he's a pretty good student. He could pay more attention
to his homework, that's for sure.
-Is there anything he doesn't do well?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
He doesn't slow dance. Ow!

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000
-Makes two of us.
-No. No, no, you're good. You know, maybe if you just let go a little.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Like this?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Yeah.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Let me show you how to enjoy all the lights and the bells
and the whistles. And remember now...

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
it's all free.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Shall we?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Excuse me ladies.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Excuse me. Thank you.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
-Alright now! Let 'er rip, now!
-Oh boy, pinball!

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
How you doin, Jack?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Can you believe this?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Little bit of competition, huh?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I've been talking to the Yankees. They wanna buy the kid.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.000
-For $25 million dollars.
-Buy him?
-Buy him!

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:34.000
-He's a kid.
-The Cubs own him. And as his manager, you get 10%,
which translations into $2.5 million dollars.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
If you can get Mary to sign the contract.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:51.000
You'll be in New York living like a king.
And I think this could be a very good time to relocate.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I'll do it.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
-But you gotta do something for me.
-Name it.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
You gotta get rid of Ched Steadman.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
-Where is he?
-He'll be here.
-He thinks he's so cool. He should be working on the boat.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
-George.
-Why do you always defend him?
-What, all I said was the word "George"!

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
[sigh] Forget it.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
[sigh]

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
From the top, everybody. And more smoke!

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
[singing] You know when it's right. You know when you feel it, baby.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
You hold it. You hear it. You taste it, yes right.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
You got the right one, baby. Yeah.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
-You could be irresistably, super hypothetically-
-Cut it! Cut it!

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I'm sorry, what was that last line again? 
If it's irresistably, hypothetically, and logically-
-Henry. Henry.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
-[sigh] This is unbelievable.
-Hey, I uh, need you to sign something.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000
-What is this?
-This is, uh, Henry's contract.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
[sigh]

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
-What do you think of New York?
-What?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I need you to be more sexy.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
How much longer is this gonna take?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Hey! Hey.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000
-Well look who finally decided to show up.
-George!
-They kept me there for hours. You think I liked doing that?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000
-I don't know. Do you?
-Look, I'm sorry. Let's just work on the boat and forget it.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
-Okay.
-No! I'm not gonna work on the boat just because you say to.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000
-What, I'm supposed to work on it by myself?
-Great idea! Work on it yourself, Mr. Superstar!

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
-What?
-The only reason you're playing for the Cubs is because you broke your stupid arm!

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
-Guys! Come on!
-Shut up!
-Make me!

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
-Come on, stop, you guys are friends!
-Come on!

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
[yelling, grunting]

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I hate you!

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
That's gonna make you stupid.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I guess it already did.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
-Steadman.
-Yeah?
-Get in here.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Ooh. Maybe I'll get my big bonus.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
-Inside. 
-Oh boy.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
-Sit down, Chet.
-No thanks.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000
The franchise is tired of waiting for your arm to come around.
Isn't that true, Sal?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:56.000
So, you're gonna sit out the rest of the season on the bench,
and then we're releasing you.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Get dressed, I'm taking you home.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Come on! Now!

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
[sigh]

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
-What's the matter?
-Henry.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Don't take this game too seriously.
Because one day it's gonna be over. Your gift will be gone.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Don't forget that.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Oh no, I promise we'll be there. Thank you. Thanks.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
-I had a limo for you waiting for you at the stadium
to take you to the photoshoot. Now where were you?
-Ched gave me a ride home. 

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Ched Steadman? I am so sick of hearing about Ched Steadman.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000
-Take it easy.
-You take it easy! Now you got 15 minutes to get there. Go get ready.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
-I'm not going.
-You're not going? You are going.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000
-I'm going to play with my friends.
-You can't just blow off a photo shoot to go out and play.
-Get out of my face, Jack!

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you!
You show me some respect!

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
-You're not my father!
-That's right, I'm not your father! Ched Steadman's not your father!

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
In fact, your mother probably doesn't know who your father is!
Your father's some guy who left town!

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
That is enough!

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
-Mary! I thought you were in the shower.
-How could you say that?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
-Mary.
-Get out of my house. I never want to see you again.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Well you're gonna be seeing me, you're gonna be seeing a lot of me!
Because we're moving to New York together!

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
-What?
-Henry's been sold to the Yankees!

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
-He sold me?
-You can't do that!

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000
-Of course I can! I'm the manager! I make the decisions!
-He is my son!

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
-He's my client!
-What? You are nuts.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
-I brought in Reebok! I brought in Pepsi!
-Stay away from him.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
He's half mine!

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Alright, mom!

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
-Don't forget your purse!
-That didn't even hurt, okay?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:41.000
-Oh my god!
-My god, that felt really good! What a bile he turned out to be!
Maybe I should have killed him. Alright, sit down, sit down.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Okay. Henry.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
-What he said about your father...
-Yeah?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:02.000
-Your father... Okay. 

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
-When I was a teenager...
-Mom. I know about dad. 

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
-What?
-I know that he left you when you were pregnant with me.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
-How did you know that?
-Grandma told me when I was in second grade.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because I thought you liked telling me stories about him.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
About how he was a great baseball player and all.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Henry, I'm sorry. I just wanted you to have someone you could look up to.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I do.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
[grunting]

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Hey.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
-So, you coming?
-Yeah!

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Mom. There's something we gotta talk about.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
You know we could actually win the division today?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
-That's great, Uncle Bob.
-The Rowengartners are here.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.000
-Henry. You should be suiting up.
-Well, Henry has something he'd like to talk to you about.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:42.000
-Oh?
-I'm not gonna be back next season.
-What? 

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:51.000
-Why? I mean, you were the best thing to happen
to baseball since Cracker Jacks.
-No, I love the Cubs. And I lovebaseball.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
But there's other things I wanna do first. 

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:05.000
-I respect that. Oh, Henry, we sure are gonna miss you around here.
-Yeah, it's been great. There's just one thing I don't understand.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
-What's that?
-Why'd you want to sell me to the Yankees?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
-What? Sell you to the Yankees?
-Yeah, I heard that Mr. Fish wanted to sell me...

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Oh, uh... No, that was just spec, Uncle Bob. Nothing final.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
-You better get out there Henry.
-Yes, sir.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
-I'm going down to the field level and watch you
win us the division.
-Yes sir!

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Soon as I take care of a little business.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
-Chet. You gonna win it for me today?
-What?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
You're starting.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
What do you mean, I'm starting?

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Big game like this, I gotta go with experience.
Even if it is you.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
-[scoffs] Sal.
-Hey guys. Chet's got the ball.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000
-Are you ready? Let's go now!
-Sal!

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
-Hey, you're starting!
-Yeah. I'm shaking like a rookie. 

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.000
-Don't worry about it. It's just the biggest game in your life.
-I know.
-Come on.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Hey! Forgot my lucky seeds.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Oh boy.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:05.000
This is it folks. This is what it's all about. One game.
There is no tomorrow. 

01:17:05.000 --> 01:01:14.000
This is for the whole Magila. For the whole ball of wax. 
For the whole kitten kabootle. For the whole enchilada.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:24.000
For the whole shootin' match. This is for all the marbles.
The division champions. The loser goes home a loser.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
The winner moves on to the World Series.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:34.000
I can't believe it. I've been waiting for my whole life
to say those words. 'Cause I've said the words before but

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
never like, "World Series!" and I'm on the air,
and we'll be right back.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Listen up! Alright now. This is the big one. Chet's on the hill.
Back him up. Play hard. Let's go.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
-Strike!
-Yes! Alright!

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
[cheering]

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000
-Strike!
-[cheering]
-Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Keep it up, big guy.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Strike.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Three strikes. That's three strikes.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Alright. Yeah!

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Steadman's heating it up like the days of yore, when men were men,
and when... and that's another story!

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
-And Mullen slashes one to the left! 
That's gonna bring around two runs!
-Yeah!

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
-Four hot dogs, please.
-Alright, sir, coming right up for you.
-Thank you.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:15.000
-What, are you kidding, Mac? You're 11 bucks short. They're 3 bucks a piece.
-3 dollars for a hot dog?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
You're out!

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
-C'mon, strike me out, okay?
-Watch this. Here I go.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Alright. Come on, Rocket!

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Steadman's a little bit of trouble with a runner on second.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Alright, get him up, get him up.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
[grunting]

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
[crowd gasps]

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Come on, come on. 

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Goodman gets a standup double! It cuts the coupling to one!
Two to one, Cubs!

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Hot dogs. Get your hot dogs. Get em hot.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Steadman is really laboring. One run is in.
And after the wild pitch Goodman is on third with two away.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
[grimaces]

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
All four! Take your base!

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
[crowd boos]

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Chet! I'm gonna take you out!

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.000
-One more.
-No!
-Give me one more.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Look. One more. 

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
[chanting] Rocket! Rocket!

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
-You're out!
-He's out at home!

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
[cheering]

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Steadman makes a game-saving out! Keeping the Cubs ahead by one!

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.000
-Stick a fork in me, I'm done.
-You gave me 6 great innings. I'm saving you for the playoffs.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
No. I mean I'm done. I belt the arm go.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000
You'll let me finish the season before you take my job, won't you?

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000
-Hey! Oh, you're the greatest, Rocket!
-Rowengartner, you're going in.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000
-What'd he call me?
-[laughs]

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
[chanting] Henry! Henry!

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Strike! You're out!

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Strike!

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
[cheering]

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
-Yeah, yeah, yeah! Good pitcher!
-You think so?
-I know so!

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Let's play some ball! Let's play some ball! Man!

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
With two outs, Oakie steps in, hoping to bring in the runner.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Oh! What a lucky stab. 

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
[crowd boos]

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:33.000
The Cubbies are one inning away from the division championship,
completing the most improbable season in baseball history!

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000
You're on. One more inning! One inning Henry!

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Oh, kid, please! Get us through this inning, and I'll never
ask you for anything else for as long as I live!

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:53.000
-Okay. But this is the last time.
-Thank you. Thank you.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
It appears nothing can stop Rowengartner now.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Just one more! And be careful!

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
[crowd gasps]

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
-Get up kid!
-Are you okay?

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000
-I'm okay.
-Alright.
-I'm okay.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000
This kid is making me crazy.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Alright, Henry, let's warm up.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
What was that? You alright?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I'm fine. Fine.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Oh no. It's gone!

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Oh no.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Play ball.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
[chanting] Henry! Henry!

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000
-Ball?
-What the hell is he doing?
-What?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Uh... well, not his best start, ball one.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:11.000
-Come on, Henry. Quit playing around!
-There's another ball.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Zoom it in there Henry! Zoom it!

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
-I have no idea.
-Henry, throw the ball, hard.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
-Ball.
[crowd boos]

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Rulinbruter! Come on!

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000
-What do you want to do now?
-Ball four. Take your base.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
-What's that kid doing out there?
-I don't know Cliff.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
[crowd boos]

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Come here. Come here. Bring it in. Get in here.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:14.000
-Listen, my arm, it's gone.
-What?
-No, listen, I can't do hard anymore. 

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
-What are we gonna do?
-I have a plan.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
[chattering]

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
1, 2, 3, Cubs!

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
The meeting's over, and here we go!

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
-Gotcha.
-You're out!

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:19.000
-The hidden ball trick!
-Alright!
-Excited.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I can't believe he fell for that.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
-Throw the heat! Throw the heat!
-Cut the funky cheese!

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Richard's calling for the attention of Wock! Again!

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:48.000
-I'm gonna kill him!
-Sal! Sal! No, no, let it go! Get over here! Just have faith! Let it go!
-He's playing stickball!

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
-Ball three.
-I'm gonna kill him. 
-Easy Chet, let him go, let him go.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Take your base.
[crowd boos]

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
-Why did he walk him?
-He could have struck him out.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
-I'm not going for the hidden ball trick either.
-I don't have the ball.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000
-Oops.
-What are you doing kid?
-I dare you to run.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
-What? What are you talking about?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I double dare you.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.000
-Hey, cut it out, let's play some ball here.
-What's the matter? Chicken? [chicken noises]

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
-Hey, I'm not chicken, cut it out.
-[chicken noises]

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:59.000
-Stop it. Just stop it. Just stop it.
-You should have run. Gee, I guess you really are chicken.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000
-I'm not a chicken, you're the chicken.
-No, you're a chicken.
-No, you're the chicken.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000
-Chicken, chicken, [chicken noises]
-No, you are the chicken. 
-You're the biggest chicken I ever seen. 

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.000
-You throw the ball real high. I dare you. See how chicken you are.
-Alright, but it's the last time.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Go, go, go.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000
You're out!

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
He got him, he got him! Two away!

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Alright Rowengartner, you do it! You do it! Anything goes!

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
-Remember me, kid?
-Oh my god.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
-Holy goosebumps. Not Hado.
-It's Hado.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I'm your worst nightmare.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:26.000
-Throw the heat! Burn it in there. Burn his hand off!
-Fastball.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
You can't hit him with your fastball.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Strike!

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.000
-Change-up. That's a change-up! It's a strike!
-Henry totally fooled him with a change-up!

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
That's it kid? What, are you kidding me? Come on, give me it.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
See ya!

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000
-Go foul, go foul.
-Stay fair, stay fair.
-Foul.
-Fair.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Foul ball.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
You were wrong again, Ernie.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Hey kid. You got nothing. I know it. And you know it.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
You're mine.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Oh god. What do I do?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Yeah.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Mom? It was you?

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
It was me.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Float it.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.000
-Henry. One more.
-Show em how, Henry.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Well, this is it, folks. Everything is riding on this pitch.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
-What are you smiling at, kid?
-Nothing.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000
-You're out!
-Yes!

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Henry! I love you!

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
We won a division! We won a division!

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000
[cheering]

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Yes, baby! Yes! I love you.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
