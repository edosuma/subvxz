[sirens wailing in distance]

00:23.523 --> 00:24.399
[sighs]

00:27.027 --> 00:29.070
Yeah, okay. It's cool.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.156
Cool?

00:32.323 --> 00:35.118
This is the most beautiful view
in all of Los Angeles.

00:35.702 --> 00:39.289
One that only angels
and very persistent pigeons get to see.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.835
You didn't bring me up here
to show me the view.

00:45.045 --> 00:45.920
What's up?

00:46.004 --> 00:48.840
[exhales]
Can't get anything past you, can I?

00:48.923 --> 00:50.008
[chuckles]

00:51.342 --> 00:52.802
Once upon a time,

00:53.762 --> 00:56.556
I made your Aunt Maze mad. [grunts]

00:57.432 --> 00:58.892
The following morning,

00:58.975 --> 01:02.437
I awoke to find my bed
crawling with southern widows.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.397
Not the good kind. The spider kind.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.151
My whiskey gone, replaced with urine.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.862
I expected more of my favorite aunt.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.865
Oh, she also did
something far more heinous.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.869
She shorted all of my suits. [shudders]

01:19.245 --> 01:21.289
-That's more like it.
-[groans]

01:21.372 --> 01:24.417
-So, did you have it coming?
-Well, you tell me.

01:25.001 --> 01:26.836
I ate the last of her Froot Loops.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.588
[both laugh]

01:30.048 --> 01:31.049
All that's to say,

01:31.132 --> 01:34.511
I can't imagine what she'll do to you
if you miss her wedding.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.805
Eve told me that you RSVP'd "no,"

01:36.888 --> 01:39.599
which is a fact she's been wise
to conceal from her future wife.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.269
Yeah, why would Maze even care?
She doesn't know me yet.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.855
You haven't given her much
of a chance to get to know you.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.690
Or anyone else for that matter.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.943
Now, this wedding's
an opportunity to fix that.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.402
Yeah?

01:51.486 --> 01:54.489
-And how would you even introduce me?
-I'll tell people the truth.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.658
-You can't tell people I've time-traveled.
-Why not?

01:56.741 --> 01:59.077
I tell them I'm the Devil,
it tends to go over…

01:59.869 --> 02:02.705
Well, I guess reviews
are mixed at this point.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.083
But the important people
already know about you.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.087
It's actually worse with people who know.

02:09.170 --> 02:12.590
They keep asking me about their fate,
and I can't tell them anything.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.635
I mean, what if I say something
that messes with the future?

02:16.469 --> 02:17.428
[sighs]

02:18.304 --> 02:21.724
And besides, I don't--
I don't have anything to wear, so…

02:21.808 --> 02:24.102
Oh, well, that is unacceptable.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.895
My tailor would be personally offended

02:25.979 --> 02:28.439
if I didn't allow them
to help you out in this time of need.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.775
They're a total genius.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.319
Saved me after the short-suiting debacle.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.447
Here, I'm going tonight
for a fitting. Join me.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.950
We could coordinate outfits.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.577
Get matching cummerbunds, perhaps.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.164
No? Okay.

02:44.247 --> 02:48.376
We could find something else
that doesn't make you make that face.

02:48.960 --> 02:49.794
No.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.547
I just--

02:53.464 --> 02:54.299
No.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.259
Right.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.637
Well, I'll be there,
if you change your mind.

02:59.721 --> 03:03.474
Not that I expect you usually do,
but a father can dream.

03:15.778 --> 03:18.198
I was wrong, Amenadiel.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.326
So wrong. I mean,
I followed my father into this job

03:21.409 --> 03:24.454
and because I believed in him,
I believed in the system,

03:24.537 --> 03:27.123
but I never imagined this.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.292
All complaints against Reiben?

03:29.375 --> 03:30.251
Not just him.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.171
Dozens of officers,
hundreds of complaints.

03:34.505 --> 03:37.800
Yeah, so much for
the "one bad apple" defense, right?

03:37.884 --> 03:41.679
And the brass signed off
on all of these, and nothing happened.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.765
I should have believed you.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.643
I'm just glad
we're on the same page now, Chloe.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.686
I'm sorry it took so long.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.688
[inhales] But my father taught me

03:50.772 --> 03:53.942
that when you see injustice,
you confront it, so I'm going back.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.027
To the LAPD.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.614
I wanna help you and Sonya
clean this up from the inside.

03:59.697 --> 04:00.907
Wow.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.992
I mean, that's-- that's-- that's great.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.745
We need all the help that we can get,
but what about Lucifer?

04:05.828 --> 04:07.914
What about being God's consultant?

04:07.997 --> 04:09.165
[inhales]

04:09.249 --> 04:12.001
Uh, the "God" thing is
on hold for right now.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.212
Lucifer doesn't feel comfortable
going to Heaven

04:14.295 --> 04:16.464
until he's patched things up with Rory.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.258
And, you know, I agree.

04:19.133 --> 04:21.344
He's gonna have to
go up eventually, Chloe.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.638
How does he feel about you staying?

04:24.555 --> 04:25.390
[Chloe] Hmm.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.643
You haven't told him. [chuckles softly]

04:29.227 --> 04:32.438
Well, I-- He's got
a lot on his plate right now.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.315
I feel like it can wait.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.150
Probably till after the wedding.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.611
I don't wanna add
any drama to Maze's big day.

04:38.695 --> 04:42.282
Drama? It's Maze and big feelings.
What could possibly go wrong?

04:43.199 --> 04:44.242
[scoffs]

04:45.660 --> 04:46.869
[Eve] Thank you.

04:46.953 --> 04:51.374
Okay, "supervise flowers." Check.

04:51.457 --> 04:55.128
"Make sure Linda's
all set to officiate." Check.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.464
"Nix your Black Sabbath
additions from the playlist." Check.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.760
Yeah, I think you're right. Black Sabbath
is a little too mellow for the wedding.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.470
[Eve] Mm-hmm.

05:04.971 --> 05:09.726
Okay, next step is confirming
the number of guests with the caterer.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.854
You sure you don't want
to invite your siblings?

05:12.937 --> 05:16.190
Yeah, no. You know, it's supposed to be
"eat, drink and be merry."

05:16.274 --> 05:18.109
Not "eat, drink and be wary

05:18.192 --> 05:21.237
that a bunch of soulless, torture-savvy
demons are gonna ruin your wedding."

05:21.321 --> 05:24.115
[chuckles]
Why do you assume that they would do that?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.075
Well, you've met them.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.535
Yes, I have.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.746
A few of them. They were awesome.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.498
Mmm. Yeah, in a fight.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.208
But that's all they're good for.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.336
How do you know?

05:36.419 --> 05:38.546
Because that's what they were made for.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.173
Hmm. [clicks tongue]

05:40.256 --> 05:42.925
That's also true about you.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.304
And you, you've evolved.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.433
Maybe they can too,
if you just gave them a chance.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.354
We're not really the "happily
ever after type," honey. Trust me.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.857
They're your family.

05:57.940 --> 05:58.775
No.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.486
You're my family.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.280
The only family I need.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.281
Okay?

06:05.823 --> 06:09.160
Which is why I am not going
to let anything or anyone

06:09.243 --> 06:11.662

No.

No. I was giving you space, you know?

Being the good,

07:39.959 --> 07:41.836

a few tricks for the bedroom,

What exactly is it you think this is?

You think this is me
just trying to get your attention?

08:45.983 --> 08:46.817
Yeah.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.403
This is not about you, Adam.

08:49.487 --> 08:54.617
This is about me, and the fact
that I fell in love with someone else.

You're in love with a demon, Eve?

make that same mistake,

Was it Lucifer? Something else?

11:15.758 --> 11:18.010
I mean, I'm not asking for specifics.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.471
Just, um, like, a teeny-tiny hint.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.599
You know, since I did the teeny-tiny
thing of birthing you.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.728
Okay, I'll tell you this one thing.

11:27.812 --> 11:28.646
Okay.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.398
In the future…

11:32.858 --> 11:35.444
that guilt trip also never works on me.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.696
[both laugh]

11:36.779 --> 11:37.655
Right.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.241
You make choices, Mom.

11:40.324 --> 11:43.828
If I told you what they are, you wouldn't
really be making them any more.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.457
-Yeah, you're right. You're right.
-[fly buzzing]

11:48.541 --> 11:49.959
-When did you become--
-[wings flap]

11:51.669 --> 11:52.712
[Chloe gasps]

11:54.130 --> 11:55.047
Sorry.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.383
The fly was driving me nuts.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.262
Um, I didn't know

12:02.054 --> 12:03.889
wings could do that.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.058
Pretty cool, huh?

12:06.142 --> 12:08.602
[Chloe] Yeah, yeah, mm-hmm.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.146
Yeah.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.650
So, um, have your wings
always been that way?

12:15.276 --> 12:17.987
-[Rory] Mm-hmm.
-Hmm.

12:18.070 --> 12:18.946
[Dan] Wow.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.033
This is weird.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.289
Though I guess of all the people
who could've taken my desk,

12:28.372 --> 12:29.957
I'm pretty happy it's you, pal.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.502
Now you're drinking out of my mug?

12:36.297 --> 12:40.050
I guess someone's gotta use it, right?
I mean, what are they gonna do, bury it?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.053
Put its ashes in an urn? [chuckles]

12:44.054 --> 12:48.058
I mean, it does say
"40 Whole Years of Being Dan."

12:48.559 --> 12:52.021
-But I guess you didn't read it.
-Ella, you got a second?

12:52.104 --> 12:53.773
-[Ella] Oh, yeah.
-[Carol] Hi, uh…

12:53.856 --> 12:56.317
-[Dan] Oh, look at that cuteness.
-Quick update.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.152
-You're welcome!
-[Carol] I have my suit now.

12:58.235 --> 13:01.947
So, I am all ready
to be your date for the wedding,

13:02.031 --> 13:03.991
and I am very excited.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.746
And this is where you say,
"I'm so excited too, Carol."

13:08.829 --> 13:12.666
-[chuckles] Of course I am excited!
-[Carol] Mm-hmm. Are you sure?

13:13.250 --> 13:15.878
Because every time
we talk about this wedding,

13:15.961 --> 13:18.506
you look like you ate a bad oyster.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.510
Ella, listen. Hey, I get it.

13:22.593 --> 13:23.844
If you're having second thoughts

13:23.928 --> 13:25.846
about even taking me
to this wedding, that's fine.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.848
[exhales] Carol Corbett,

13:27.932 --> 13:32.019
I am 100% not having second thoughts

13:32.102 --> 13:33.938
about you being my wedding date.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.606
-Okay?
-Cool.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.964
I hate keeping this from him, Dan.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.217
Holy crap. Can you…

14:03.759 --> 14:06.262
-Can you s--
-[frog croaking]

14:07.137 --> 14:08.013
Right.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.225
Other Dan. [sighs]

14:11.767 --> 14:14.478
Gosh, I just wish
I had someone to talk to.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.438
-I mean, other than a frog.
-[croaks]

14:16.522 --> 14:17.857
Oh, no offense.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.275
Hey.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.153
Ella, you can talk to me.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.780
-What's wrong?
-[sighs]

14:24.864 --> 14:26.699
Carol just wouldn't understand.

14:26.782 --> 14:30.452
What? What wouldn't he understand?
Are you not into him anymore?

14:31.328 --> 14:32.788
Is it the loud chewing?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.624
Damn it,
I should have warned you. I knew it.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.085
But they can never find out that I know.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.297
Who's "they"?

14:42.214 --> 14:44.884
Oh, is this family-related?
Is it one of your brothers?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.969
It's just, if they… [sighs]

14:47.553 --> 14:50.222
But how could I even…

14:50.931 --> 14:51.891
I mean…

14:52.683 --> 14:54.351
world-altering!

14:54.935 --> 14:57.229
But then again… [chuckles]

14:57.313 --> 15:00.941
Oh, I just-- I feel so useless.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.359
Tell me about it.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.987
[sighs] Who am I kidding?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.365
Even if you could hear me
and told me what was wrong,

15:08.449 --> 15:09.742
how could I actually help you?

15:10.492 --> 15:14.079
I mean, honestly,
Other Dan has a better shot than I do.

15:44.985 --> 15:48.864
It's normal that seeing your ex,
suddenly, after a long period of time

15:48.948 --> 15:51.116
would bring up unwanted feelings.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.159
[Adam] Unwanted?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.287
My feelings are legit, okay?

15:55.371 --> 15:57.790
I gave that woman everything she wanted.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.375
And what did she give me?

16:00.167 --> 16:03.837
A rep as the world's number one cuckold.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.424
She cheated on me
the second she met somebody new.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.343
But I took her back. Why?

16:10.260 --> 16:12.304
Because we were made for each other.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.765
-Aww, that's sweet.
-She doesn't think so.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.434
So she's marrying somebody else.

16:17.518 --> 16:21.397
-Your ex is engaged?
-Yeah, to a woman, of all things.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.526
I mean, how's that gonna make me look?
Do you think she even considered that?

16:25.609 --> 16:26.902
[inhales]

16:27.569 --> 16:30.614
Well, it sounds like she's moved on.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.741
And maybe you should too.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.953
And know that takes time.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.414
A common rule of thumb suggests a month

16:38.497 --> 16:40.457
for every year you were together.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.126
All right, so…

16:44.586 --> 16:45.796
Carry the one…

16:46.880 --> 16:48.465
[mutters]

16:48.549 --> 16:51.218
How-- how many years is a million months?

16:53.804 --> 16:57.141
Yeah, don't worry about it, okay?
It's too long.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.768
-Eve's getting married tomorrow.
-Wait, Eve?

17:00.519 --> 17:03.063
As in "Eve" Eve?

17:04.064 --> 17:06.025
Your ex is Eve?

17:06.108 --> 17:07.901
-Yeah.
-Do you mean that you're--

17:07.985 --> 17:09.570
Yeah, I'm that Adam.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.821
I'm the guy.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.032
The guy who named
all the animals. No biggie.

17:13.115 --> 17:13.991
Yeah, well…

17:14.074 --> 17:15.617
Kind of. You know platypus?

17:15.701 --> 17:17.578
Eh-- Uh, sure.

17:17.661 --> 17:20.164
The second I saw that thing,
I was like, "platypus."

17:20.247 --> 17:23.208
That wasn't even a word.
This is important stuff.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.169
That's why I can't let the wedding happen.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.297
Oh, no, I beg to differ. I'm not just
saying that because I'm their officiant,

17:28.380 --> 17:29.923
which I am, by the way.

17:30.632 --> 17:31.884
-Small world.
-Yeah.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.970
I mean, what are the odds, right?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.305
Right.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.598
[sighs]

17:40.184 --> 17:42.144
Oh, I'm in trouble, aren't I?

17:47.733 --> 17:51.236
Look, I enjoy breaking into
people's places as much as the next girl,

17:51.320 --> 17:53.906
but I really think
you're overreacting, honey.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.450
[Eve] Look, she is not home.

17:56.533 --> 17:59.369
Her phone is going straight
to voicemail. [clears throat]

17:59.453 --> 18:03.707
She is not replying to any of my texts
about the marriage certificate.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.668
Even the ones I sent
with that adorable Memoji.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.506
I'm telling you, something is wrong.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.382
That Memoji slays!

18:12.466 --> 18:17.137
[sighs] Yeah, well, maybe she's
just using the sex toys we gave her

18:17.221 --> 18:19.556
as a thank you
for agreeing to be our officiant.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.975
[chuckles] We gave her a fruit basket.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.393
Exactly.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.480
So why don't we just leave
the marriage certificate on her desk?

18:26.563 --> 18:28.273
And we can come back tomorrow.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.485
Oh, my God, what am I sitting in that--

18:31.568 --> 18:33.028
What is that smell?

18:34.822 --> 18:36.824
[sniffs] Oh!

18:37.616 --> 18:40.702
That is Adam's aftershave.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.746
[huffs] I knew it.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.832
I've been smelling this shit
for centuries.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.333
What? Adam was here?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.418
-Why?
-[laughs] Why?

18:48.502 --> 18:52.256
Because he kidnapped our officiant
to stop the wedding from happening!

18:52.339 --> 18:54.883
-Now come on, he wouldn't go that far.
-Oh, yeah?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.176
Yeah, he would!

18:56.260 --> 18:59.388
He's not used to hearing "no."
Especially from a woman.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.556
Let alone two.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.350
-Oh, my God.
-[exhales]

19:03.433 --> 19:06.395
I can't believe you were married
to that bro-hole for so long.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.523
What do you mean?
It wasn't like I had a lot of options.

19:09.606 --> 19:12.442
We were, like, the only two humans
on Earth for a while.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.155
And then we just got busy
with the kids, you know?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.323
Cain's terrible twos
were nothing to sneeze at.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.243
Yeah, well, his 20,000s
weren't all that hot either.

19:22.411 --> 19:27.708
It just took me some time
to see Adam for what he really was.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.128
Then when I did,

19:31.211 --> 19:36.550
I left his ass in the dust,
and I found you, right?

19:37.050 --> 19:39.803
-And now he's kidnapped Linda.
-[sighs]

19:41.054 --> 19:42.890
You can't let him get to you.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.185
Hey, all that stuff
he said about Lilith, that's--

19:46.894 --> 19:49.271
[sighs] You're nothing like her.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.524
[huffs] Yeah, not now.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.151
But I will be.

19:55.319 --> 19:58.197
I mean, everyone becomes
their mother eventually, right?

19:58.697 --> 20:02.117
And-- and how would you know, anyway?
You've never met Lilith.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.244
Well, I feel like I did.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.455
He talked about her all the time.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.334
-[Mazikeen] He did?
-Mm-hmm.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.545
"Lilith this, Lilith that."
[imitates monkey]

20:13.629 --> 20:16.048
Hey, babe, babe,
I think I know how we get Linda back.

20:16.131 --> 20:19.468
-But we've gotta find him first.
-Oh, trust me, we will.

20:19.551 --> 20:23.055
Mr. "I Named All the Animals"
is not gonna know what hit him.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.973
Yeah, he's got a cell phone, right?

20:25.057 --> 20:29.186
-So we call my guy, he can triangulate--
-Or straight out of the Maze handbook.

20:29.853 --> 20:33.106
The most efficient bounty hunter
doesn't find her perp.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.776
She makes the perp find her.

20:35.859 --> 20:36.693
That's right.

20:36.777 --> 20:41.198
All we have to do is just
bait him with what he most wants.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.117
-Yeah, come on.
-[chuckles]

20:47.037 --> 20:49.456
-Amenadiel, hey.
-Hey!

20:49.998 --> 20:52.542
When you said you were coming back,
I didn't think you meant today.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.503
I'm not here for work.

20:54.586 --> 20:59.132
I actually-- I wanted to,
um, ask you something, um…

20:59.216 --> 21:01.551
about-- Oh, step over here.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.390
I wanted to ask you about angels.

21:06.473 --> 21:09.101
Um, their wings, specifically.

21:09.810 --> 21:10.894
What about 'em?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.689
I know how Lucifer's wings change

21:13.772 --> 21:15.941
according to how
he's feeling about himself.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.944
-So is that a thing with all angels?
-Well, it must be.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.446
I mean, there's no reason
to believe that self-actualization

21:21.530 --> 21:23.407
is the case for some but not for all.

21:24.157 --> 21:28.370
I actually went through
a little bit of a wing-thing myself, so…

21:29.204 --> 21:30.205
Why do you ask?

21:30.914 --> 21:34.876
Um, well, I just saw Rory's wings.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.837
Th-- They're weapons, Amenadiel.

21:36.920 --> 21:40.674
All angel wings can be.
It just depends how they're wielded.

21:40.757 --> 21:43.552
Yeah, but they were metallic, almost,

21:43.635 --> 21:46.763
and each feather was
like its own precision blade.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.348
Wow.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.560
They sound awesome.

21:52.853 --> 21:56.773
I wonder if Charlie's would be that cool.
I mean, if he gets them.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.943
-It doesn't matter either way, of course.
-Of course.

22:00.569 --> 22:04.364
It's just, being a cop
isn't the safest job, you know?

22:04.948 --> 22:09.786
I just-- I wonder if Rory felt
like she needed to protect herself

22:09.870 --> 22:12.581
because I-- I couldn't.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.624
[sighs] Yeah, um…

22:16.001 --> 22:17.294
Listen, um…

22:19.046 --> 22:21.340
if what Sonya went through
is any indication,

22:21.423 --> 22:23.717
then changing the system won't be easy.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.179
We won't just be
fighting criminals out there.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.640
We'll be fighting some
of our co-workers in here.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.688
I mean, it's one thing
to make myself a target, but…

22:38.023 --> 22:40.192
is it fair
to put my daughters through that?

22:41.943 --> 22:42.986
Look, I, uh…

22:44.613 --> 22:46.073
[exhales]

22:46.156 --> 22:48.200
I can't tell you what to do, Chloe.

22:49.576 --> 22:52.454
But I can say that you're lucky
that you have a choice at all.

22:52.537 --> 22:57.167
So many people don't have the option
to just walk away from this fight.

22:58.794 --> 22:59.753
You're right.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.548
[sighs] You're right.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.635
If the place that I worked
almost my entire life

23:06.718 --> 23:09.262
is part of the problem,
then the least I can do

23:09.346 --> 23:10.931
is be part of the solution.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.892
Make the world a bit better for my kids.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.895
Rory will have a wonderful childhood.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.357
Because she has a wonderful mother.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.076
[Adam] You know,
I'm glad you came to your senses.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.955
[sighs] A doggy
always comes back to its bone.

23:35.622 --> 23:36.832
So glad you're here.

23:37.582 --> 23:40.460
Huh, 'cause we can be together again?

23:41.044 --> 23:43.839
'Cause you are going
to tell me where Linda is.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.676
[chuckles] Sorry, babe. No can do.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.262
[slurps]

23:50.971 --> 23:53.432
We'll see about that, babe.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.811
What? [exhales]

23:57.894 --> 24:01.731
Is your little pet demon lying in wait,
ready to take me down?

24:02.441 --> 24:03.525
No.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.862
Just little old me.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.991
[grunting]

24:11.074 --> 24:13.326
[panting]

24:13.410 --> 24:16.663
And my rainbow-colored belts. [exhales]

24:20.417 --> 24:21.418
[Adam groans]

24:22.461 --> 24:24.463
[Mazikeen cackling]

24:29.509 --> 24:30.760
Adam.

24:32.262 --> 24:35.348
-[Adam] Lilith?
-Hmm. [sighs]

24:36.475 --> 24:38.560
Oh, Adam.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.482
You never forget your first.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.608
Am I right?

24:44.691 --> 24:45.775
You…

24:48.945 --> 24:50.363
aren't Lilith.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.199
[Mazikeen] Oh.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.326
Close enough though.

24:55.035 --> 24:58.205
Her spitting image in more ways than one.

24:58.955 --> 24:59.873
Hmm?

25:01.166 --> 25:03.543
Isn't this what you wanted all along?

25:05.003 --> 25:05.837
No.

25:07.547 --> 25:08.882
I got rid of Lilith.

25:08.965 --> 25:11.468
[chuckles] Oh, you.

25:12.552 --> 25:15.514
We both know how that really went down.

25:15.597 --> 25:19.476
You had Daddy send me away because I…

25:20.268 --> 25:22.604
rejected you.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.691
I couldn't love you the way you loved me.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.068
It's not what I do.

25:29.027 --> 25:33.490
So God sent you a consolation prize.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.536
Sweet, pliable Eve.

25:38.495 --> 25:41.998
A plaything for you to have dominion over,
like the animals.

25:44.417 --> 25:45.460
Look at her.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.379
Go on.

25:48.630 --> 25:49.589
Say it.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.676
She could never fill my shoes.

25:54.844 --> 25:56.638
She's not even a whole person.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.392
-Just a piece of you.
-Okay, that's enough.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.144
What are you doing?

26:06.690 --> 26:09.317
I'm torturing him so we can find Linda.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.153
Yeah, but who are you really
torturing here though? Him or me?

26:12.237 --> 26:15.782
-You're just the button I'm pushing.
-Okay, well, stop pushing.

26:15.865 --> 26:18.368
-Use something else.
-That's not how torture works, Eve.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.996
-Really?
-[Mazikeen] This is what I do.

26:21.079 --> 26:21.997
-Who I am.
-[Eve huffs]

26:22.080 --> 26:25.375
You want demons at your wedding?
Well, this is what it looks like.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.128
What? Too much for you?

26:29.921 --> 26:31.548
Oh, right. Well…

26:32.924 --> 26:35.260
Guess that's a good thing
Adam showed up when he did, huh?

26:35.844 --> 26:37.387
Now you've seen the real me.

26:37.470 --> 26:40.682
You can leave my ass in the dust
before it's too late.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.767
Leave your a-- Why would I…

26:48.231 --> 26:50.358
-Adam.
-[Adam] Yes.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.112
How did you find out about the wedding?

26:54.195 --> 26:57.616
Uh, I heard it from Saraqael,

26:58.158 --> 27:00.577
who heard it from Gabriel,

27:01.620 --> 27:03.872
who could have heard it from anybody

27:03.955 --> 27:07.167
because it's actually the talk
of the town up in the Silver City.

27:07.250 --> 27:10.629
And as you can imagine,
it's not really doing wonders for my rep,

27:10.712 --> 27:13.381
but that's, you know,
neither here nor there--

27:13.465 --> 27:14.382
Maze.

27:14.883 --> 27:15.884
[Mazikeen] What?

27:16.968 --> 27:18.303
How did he find out?

27:21.264 --> 27:23.725
Fine. Yeah, it was me.

27:25.393 --> 27:29.648
I sent the news hoping
your idiot ex would do something about it.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.566
I'm the idiot? Really?

27:31.650 --> 27:35.403
Everyone knows it's "Adam and Eve,"
not "Eve and some rando demon."

27:35.487 --> 27:37.989
Why would you want him to find out?

27:38.073 --> 27:40.408
-[Mazikeen] Because I-- I--
-Because what?

27:40.492 --> 27:42.160
Because I can't be a mother!

27:46.373 --> 27:48.208
That's what this is all about?

27:48.291 --> 27:52.545
The fact that I said that
you would be a good mom, once?

27:52.629 --> 27:56.341
Once was all it took for me to realize
you have no idea who you're marrying.

27:56.925 --> 28:00.261
I can't be a good mother, Eve.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.057
I'd just end up like her.

28:04.140 --> 28:08.186
And what, we couldn't just talk about this
like-- like a normal couple?

28:08.269 --> 28:09.646
I'm not normal!

28:09.729 --> 28:10.605
[Eve sighs]

28:10.689 --> 28:12.732
I don't do "talking."

28:12.816 --> 28:16.194
-I needed you to see the real me.
-[Eve] What? What is the real you?

28:16.861 --> 28:20.073
What? An evil demon
that just ruins everything,

28:20.156 --> 28:22.951
and this will never work out? I can't…

28:23.034 --> 28:25.787
-I can't-- I can't do this anymore.
-You can't do this?

28:25.870 --> 28:29.040
Yeah, I can't be the only one
that believes in you.

28:29.124 --> 28:32.001
I can't be the only one
that believes in us. I, uh--

28:33.461 --> 28:35.338
Of course we don't have to have kids,

28:35.422 --> 28:38.425
but if I'm the only one
who's willing to talk about it and--

28:38.508 --> 28:41.428
and change and-- and compromise, then…

28:41.511 --> 28:43.304
[panting]

28:43.388 --> 28:45.265
…then we shouldn't be together.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.602
We definitely
should not be getting married.

28:53.940 --> 28:54.899
Wait!

28:58.820 --> 28:59.738
[Eve] What?

29:02.157 --> 29:04.659
[Mazikeen] Well, uh,
we still have to find Linda.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.666
I'm sure you'll manage.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.559
Oh, boy. [sighs]

29:32.312 --> 29:34.314
[sighing]

29:34.397 --> 29:37.192
Maze, I got your text.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.778
What's the emergency?
I have a suit that needs fitting.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.279
[shuddering] No, you don't.

29:41.362 --> 29:43.823
I need you to stop me from killing him!

29:47.535 --> 29:48.578
Adam.

29:49.704 --> 29:52.791
But I thought you were dead and buried.

29:52.874 --> 29:55.335
Dust you are
and blah, blah, blah. [chuckles]

29:56.085 --> 29:58.463
So what's he doing here?

29:58.546 --> 29:59.756
And why are you…?

30:01.216 --> 30:02.300
Where's Eve?

30:04.260 --> 30:05.386
Oh, Maze.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.556
When it comes to self-sabotage,
I fear you've outdone me.

30:09.182 --> 30:11.518
Does this mean
my best fiend's wedding is off?

30:13.144 --> 30:14.854
He kidnapped our officiant.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.068
-[Lucifer] Where's Dr. Linda?
-[Mazikeen] He isn't talking.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.069
[Lucifer splutters]

30:21.653 --> 30:23.696
The wedding's off.
He got what he wanted, didn't he?

30:23.780 --> 30:27.158
-What are you really after?
-What, you think I'm gonna tell you, huh?

30:27.242 --> 30:31.079
Make it easy for the Devil,
who stole my wife twice?

30:31.162 --> 30:34.332
Actually, fig leaf,
that's exactly what you're going to do.

30:34.916 --> 30:35.834
Tell me,

30:37.001 --> 30:39.546
what is it you truly desire, Adam?

30:41.381 --> 30:42.423
I…

30:43.341 --> 30:44.175
[sighs]

30:45.093 --> 30:46.928
I wanna be a better man.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.222
Oh.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.808
[Adam hesitates] No.

30:51.891 --> 30:55.395
At first, I kidnapped the doctor
to sabotage the wedding, yeah.

30:55.478 --> 30:59.190
But then she helped me realize
what I really need.

30:59.899 --> 31:02.569
-To deal with my issues.
-What issues?

31:02.652 --> 31:04.863
Well, when God first made me,
my role was clear.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.532
Name all the animals,
avoid certain fruit and be a man.

31:07.615 --> 31:10.618
That meant, "be strong, show no weakness
and problem-solve through violence."

31:11.578 --> 31:14.289
But everything has changed since.

31:14.372 --> 31:17.041
Women are no longer
an obedient piece of men.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.668
And dudes…

31:19.919 --> 31:21.379
Dudes can be vulnerable.

31:21.921 --> 31:22.797
Which is…

31:24.173 --> 31:25.091
Which is scary.

31:25.174 --> 31:26.050
[Lucifer] Hmm.

31:26.134 --> 31:29.262
And wolves, they've turned
into, like, 800 kinds of pets.

31:29.345 --> 31:31.764
Some with really dumb names, by the way.

31:31.848 --> 31:32.891
"Poodle"?

31:32.974 --> 31:36.311
I mean, that's why you don't let
amateurs do the jobs of professionals.

31:38.104 --> 31:42.358
Anyway, she said that
my beliefs about what a man should be

31:42.442 --> 31:43.902
are actually hurting me.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.696
Apparently it's called toxic masculinity,
and it's, um…

31:48.406 --> 31:49.616
it's pretty common.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.662
The good news is she can cure me.

31:54.746 --> 31:55.705
She's cool.

31:55.788 --> 31:58.583
So, when I'm done with the treatment,
I'll let her go.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.460
So you're asserting dominance over a woman

32:00.543 --> 32:03.338
in order to learn how
to stop asserting dominance over women?

32:03.421 --> 32:06.966
-Dude, you are beyond help.
-Whoa, at least I'm trying.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.176
You call this trying?

32:08.259 --> 32:11.930
If you need therapy, you call the office,
make an appointment and pay in cash.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.015
Or in kind, if she's up for it.

32:14.098 --> 32:15.725
I mean, have some decency, man.

32:16.601 --> 32:17.602
Word, man.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.605
[sighs] You're making me realize
I've not been going about this

32:20.688 --> 32:22.857
in the most ideal way. [chuckles]

32:23.524 --> 32:26.986
Classic Adam. Yeah, wokeness is hard.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.738
I gotta be better at it.

32:28.821 --> 32:29.864
And I will.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.534
I swear I didn't hurt the doctor.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.328
-I can take you to her.
-[Lucifer] Thank you.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.580
See?

32:37.664 --> 32:40.708
Even the most primitive
of men can evolve. [grunts]

32:41.250 --> 32:44.921
And even the most badass
of demons can soften.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.547
Hmm.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.549
Scary, but it's true, Maze.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.467
Yeah.

32:50.301 --> 32:54.389
Yeah, because I've come such a long way
from wreaking hell, inflicting pain…

32:56.724 --> 32:58.851
[sobs] …and driving everyone away.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.606
All I know is the Mazikeen I used to know

33:03.690 --> 33:05.775
wouldn't have hesitated to kill the guy.

[Mazikeen clears throat]

36:32.106 --> 36:33.941

36:34.025 --> 36:37.361
I'm just terrified of becoming my mother.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.781
And sometimes it's easier
to act as though I already have,

36:40.865 --> 36:42.867
instead of fighting.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.037
But I've-- I have changed so much,

36:46.120 --> 36:47.955
and I can keep on changing.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.832
Can I ever be normal? Probably not.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.250
But I can be better.

36:52.668 --> 36:54.003
And I promise,

if you give us another shot,

36:57.006 --> 36:58.966
I will never stop trying.

But, you know, nothing's really
that interesting, not even birding.

No way. I love Lucifer, but no way.

You love him, huh?

50:13.885 --> 50:14.720
Why?

50:15.429 --> 50:20.017
'Cause he's funny and weird
and really bad at board games.

50:20.642 --> 50:22.227
Lucifer plays board games?

50:22.310 --> 50:24.896
At least once a week. On game night.

gonna take Trixie home.

You're not leaving right now, are you?
Maze is only on her third tequila… bottle.

51:17.824 --> 51:19.993
That's what you have to say to me?

51:20.077 --> 51:22.204
I waited. You never showed up.

Waited? Where? Showed up for what?

51:27.959 --> 51:30.629
Oh, you went to the tailor. [laughs]

Oh! You went to the tailor.

Maze needed my help.

you did say you weren't going.
