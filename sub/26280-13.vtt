00:02.480 --> 00:04.439
Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:04.482 --> 00:06.963
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.660
And this is:
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

00:08.704 --> 00:10.532
and Dr. Amy Farrah
Fowler present...

00:10.575 --> 00:14.884
BOTH: Dr. Sheldon Cooper's
Fun with Flags.

00:14.927 --> 00:17.974
I'd like to start this episode
by apologizing on behalf

00:18.018 --> 00:20.411
of Dr. Fowler, who made
the wild claim last week

00:20.455 --> 00:22.283
that there was no national
tricolored flag

00:22.326 --> 00:24.328
with a purple stripe,
when, in fact,

00:24.372 --> 00:26.287
the Estonian governorate
inside the Russian Empire

00:26.330 --> 00:31.074
had a purple stripe on their
flag from 1721 to 1917.

00:33.120 --> 00:37.428
See? Right there
in the middle.

00:37.472 --> 00:40.475
And I'd like to apologize
on behalf of Dr. Cooper

00:40.518 --> 00:42.825
for having his zipper down
for the entire segment

00:42.868 --> 00:46.394
on the flags of East Africa.

00:46.437 --> 00:50.180
Sorry, Tanzania,
you deserve better.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.269
All right, on today's episode,

00:52.313 --> 00:54.141
we're gonna start
with some viewer e-mails.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.012
Oh, take off your glasses
so people can't see

00:56.056 --> 00:57.405
your password in
the reflection.

00:57.448 --> 01:00.712
Oh, s-sure.

01:00.756 --> 01:04.499
Okay, our first e-mail
is-- mm-- from...

01:04.542 --> 01:07.067
uh, Brad or Brian?

01:07.110 --> 01:10.853
I don't know, maybe it's Seth.All right, put them back on.

01:10.896 --> 01:15.858
Oh. Uh... oh, my gosh,
it's from Fermilab in Chicago.

01:15.901 --> 01:18.600
Ah. Not surprising,
the Windy City.

01:18.643 --> 01:21.255
Great flag town.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.257
No, no, it's about our paper.

01:23.300 --> 01:27.043
A team of physicists confirmed
super-asymmetry.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.437
Our paper was right.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.091
We did it.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.788
We did it?

01:32.831 --> 01:35.095
We did it.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.966
We did it.

01:37.009 --> 01:39.708
BOTH:
We did it!

01:39.751 --> 01:44.060
We did it!
We did it!

01:44.104 --> 01:47.933
Aw, remember when they only
did it on her birthday?

So, my incredible wife
has some exciting news.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.099
Howie, stop.
I don't want to brag.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.362
Oh, okay, sorry.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.148
[clears throat]

02:32.543 --> 02:35.067
Really? No one's gonna ask?

02:35.111 --> 02:37.766
Sorry. What's your news?

02:37.809 --> 02:39.898
The drug I've been working on
for the past five years

02:39.942 --> 02:41.552
just got approved by the FDA.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.598
Wow.Oh, congratulations.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.382
Was that the decongestant
you developed?

02:45.426 --> 02:48.690
No, we had to rebrand that as
a solvent for mining equipment.

02:50.561 --> 02:53.216
Is it that anti-itch cream you
were testing on grad students?

02:53.260 --> 02:55.087
It's not, but that's
a really funny story

02:55.131 --> 02:57.612
which I'm legally prevented
from telling you.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.136
It's her
anti-inflammatory drug.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.659
Oh.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.531
Yep, three years of testing
and no reported side effects.

03:03.574 --> 03:04.880
Ah, so it works.

03:04.923 --> 03:05.968
Eh.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.886
Well, congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.192
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you,

03:12.235 --> 03:13.976
because I want you
to head up my sales team.

03:14.019 --> 03:17.240
Really? Me? Don't you want
someone with more experience?

03:17.284 --> 03:18.589
Nope. The job's all yours.

03:18.633 --> 03:19.938
[laughs]
Okay, well, thank you.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.592
Why don't we just chat
about this at work?

03:21.636 --> 03:24.682
We can chat about it all you
want, but you're doing it.

03:24.726 --> 03:27.250
[chuckles]
We'll see.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.774
That's a yes.

03:29.818 --> 03:31.994
You guys will never believe
what just happened.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.300
Yeah, we heard.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.258
You did it.

03:35.302 --> 03:38.566
We did do it.

03:38.609 --> 03:41.525
And we didn't even
know we did it!

03:42.744 --> 03:44.702
Wait, what?

03:44.746 --> 03:48.532
Two physicists in Chicago
had to tell us.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.797
Wait, what?

03:52.841 --> 03:55.539
Their experiment on kaon decay
supported our predictions

03:55.583 --> 03:58.629
on the higher order corrections
pertaining to super-asymmetry.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.197
Wait, what?

04:02.546 --> 04:05.027
I am so proud of you.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.681
Well, I know how
to do the dishes.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.726
Just, sometimes
I'm tired.

04:11.512 --> 04:15.124
No, I-I mean, I'm proud of
how well you're doing at work.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.300
Are you even using soap?

04:17.344 --> 04:19.911
Do you want to do this?Yeah, I really do.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.913
You know, it was nice
of Bernadette to offer,

04:21.957 --> 04:24.307
but I'm not sure it's
the right move for me.

04:24.351 --> 04:25.526
Well, what are you
talking about?

04:25.569 --> 04:27.179
If you were in charge
of her project,

04:27.223 --> 04:28.572
wouldn't that
be a promotion?

04:28.616 --> 04:30.357
Well, yeah, but it's not
the most important thing.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.097
Aren't you always saying
it's about the work,

04:32.141 --> 04:34.317
not more money
or a better title?

04:34.361 --> 04:37.755
All the smart things I say,
and you remember the dumb one.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.105
Plus, I'd be working
for Bernadette.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.716
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

04:41.759 --> 04:44.153
Look, I-I know she
can be difficult,

04:44.196 --> 04:45.850
but she's no match for you.

04:45.894 --> 04:48.766
Whatever she dishes out, you
can give it right back double.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.159
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

04:50.202 --> 04:52.466
There you go.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.295
[intercom beeps]

04:55.338 --> 04:56.513
RECEPTIONIST:
President Siebert,

04:56.557 --> 04:58.559
I have Dr. Cooper
and Dr. Fowler for you.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.474
Great.

05:00.517 --> 05:03.215
You two.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.870
Bring it in.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.698
[stammers] What are
we bringing in?

05:07.742 --> 05:09.134
A hug.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.963
Oh. No, I don't want to.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.749
Well, what you don't want,
you don't get.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.317
Come on. Sit.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.841
I hope you know, with these
new data supporting your theory,

05:19.884 --> 05:22.539
we could be looking
at a Nobel-winning achievement.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.541
And by "we,"

05:24.585 --> 05:26.021
you mean "we,"

05:26.064 --> 05:28.240
not "we."

05:28.284 --> 05:30.678
"We," "we," whatever.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.070
Whee!

05:32.114 --> 05:34.377
Just a heads-up.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.379
Doctors Pemberton and Campbell
from Fermilab

05:36.423 --> 05:39.251
are flying to Los Angeles,
and they are eager to meet you.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.732
Confirming my theory,
eager to meet me.

05:41.776 --> 05:44.256
They are checking
all my boxes.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.433
You know,
Caltech has 38 Nobel laureates.

05:46.476 --> 05:50.175
If you win, you and Amy
will be 39 and 40.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.917
Ooh! Dibs on 39.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.571
What's the difference?

05:54.615 --> 05:56.791
Wha... You are right,
there is no difference at all.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.580
Thank you. It is exciting.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.495
Oh, that's very sweet.

06:05.539 --> 06:06.975
I'm gonna remember
you said that.

06:07.018 --> 06:09.369
Just like I remember how
you tried to take my office

06:09.412 --> 06:10.935
when I was on maternity leave.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.807
[laughs]

06:12.850 --> 06:14.896
Of course I'm not angry.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.898
Bye-bye.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.074
How can I be angry
at a dead man?

06:20.815 --> 06:22.425
Hey, you got a sec?

06:22.469 --> 06:23.426
Sure. What's up?

06:23.470 --> 06:25.385
Uh, bad news.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.864
I spoke to my supervisor

06:26.908 --> 06:28.605
about heading up
your sales team, and she said

06:28.649 --> 06:30.128
she just can't
lose me right now.

06:30.172 --> 06:33.088
Do you want me to call her?
I could rip her a new one.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.959
No, no. No ripping.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.222
Um, anyway, I-I don't want
to leave her shorthanded,

06:37.266 --> 06:38.398
so I'm sorry.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.312
I respect that.

06:40.356 --> 06:41.966
That's what makes you
a good employee.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.098
Oh, thank you.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.534
It's just such a bummer.

06:44.578 --> 06:47.711
I know. Just, ugh!

06:47.755 --> 06:49.974
You sure you don't want me
to call her?

06:50.018 --> 06:52.020
Oh, no, I'm sure, definitely
sure. Don't call her.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.718
But, you know, just, ugh, why?

06:57.678 --> 07:00.724
The last time we were in this
room, we were getting married.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.117
I remember.

07:02.160 --> 07:06.469
It's a lot less impressive
without Mark Hamill in it.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.340
That's what you said
about our honeymoon.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.604
And I stand by it.

07:10.647 --> 07:11.996
Doctors Cooper and Fowler,

07:12.040 --> 07:13.824
these are Doctors Pemberton
and Campbell,

07:13.868 --> 07:15.522
whose experiment
confirmed your work.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.915
Hello. Nice to meet you.Nice to meet you. Hi.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.704
Okay, I'll leave you all to it.

07:23.747 --> 07:26.010
Remember about
the hugging.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.841
It is such a pleasure
to meet you.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.669
Oh, it's really nice
to meet you, too.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.671
I mean, we thought we'd
have to wait decades

07:34.715 --> 07:36.194
to get confirmation
for our theory.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.501
Yes, thanks to you,
I'll get to eat my Nobel dinner

07:38.545 --> 07:40.198
with my original teeth.

07:40.242 --> 07:43.201
Well, this certainly is a thrill
for us. Lunch with you two,

07:43.245 --> 07:45.726
and, uh, tomorrow, we're gonna
see a taping of Ellen.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.468
She's having John Stamos on.

07:48.511 --> 07:49.947
Uncle Jesse!

07:49.991 --> 07:52.559
Sounds fun.

07:52.602 --> 07:56.258
So, um, listen, we just
published a few months ago.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.739
How did you have time to
design an experiment?

07:58.782 --> 08:03.308
We didn't. This whole thing
is actually a gigantic accident.

08:03.352 --> 08:04.919
CAMPBELL: Yeah, we've been
working with kaons,

08:04.962 --> 08:06.660
and our data made
absolutely no sense.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.792
A few weeks ago, someone
told us about your paper,

08:08.836 --> 08:10.881
and we realized
that our failed experiment

08:10.925 --> 08:12.666
confirmed your theory.

08:12.709 --> 08:14.189
And now,
instead of losing our jobs,

08:14.232 --> 08:16.496
Fermilab flew us to L.A.
Economy Plus.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.500
Free headphones.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.547
Looks like my wife left me
a month too soon.

08:24.591 --> 08:25.679
[laughs]

08:27.681 --> 08:31.598
[stammers] So you weren't even
thinking about super-asymmetry?

08:31.641 --> 08:33.338
Thinking about it?
[chuckles]

08:33.382 --> 08:35.384
We don't even
understand it.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.342
[both laugh]PEMBERTON: And
now look at

08:37.386 --> 08:39.780
the four of us,
changing the face of physics!

08:39.823 --> 08:41.390
Ooh, I got to do it.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.186
Oh, man, that last episode of
Star Trek: Discoverywas crazy.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I-I'm actually one behind.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.625
I haven't started
the new season yet.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.150
Ooh, uh, how about
this week's Walking Dead?

09:02.193 --> 09:03.325
Two behind.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.544
Three behind.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.982
Black Mirror?
No.

09:08.025 --> 09:09.636
No.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.899
Come on, there must be
something we've all seen.

09:11.942 --> 09:14.249
Oh, how about that video
of my dog I sent you,

09:14.292 --> 09:17.165
where she's growling
at a pinecone?

09:17.208 --> 09:18.819
I actually hadn't
watched it yet,

09:18.862 --> 09:20.560
but thanks
for ruining the ending.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.214
Uh, can you believe this?

09:23.258 --> 09:25.913
Doctors Pemberton and Campbell
have been doing a press tour

09:25.956 --> 09:27.828
trying to take credit
for super-asymmetry.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.525
They didn't even know
what they were finding.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.962
So what? I mean, no one's
gonna give them credit

09:32.006 --> 09:33.181
for accidentally
discovering something.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.313
WOLOWITZ:
Yeah, who remembers the guy

09:35.357 --> 09:38.142
who was trying to find India
and discovered America instead?

09:38.186 --> 09:39.840
What was his name again?[chuckles]

09:39.883 --> 09:42.756
But this is different.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.932
Sheldon, super-asymmetry
is your paper.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.629
Everyone knows
you were there first.

09:46.673 --> 09:50.285
Mm, actually, the Nobel
Committee has sometimes favored

09:50.328 --> 09:53.593
experimentalists like them
over theoreticians like you.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.856
No, that's just
a scary campfire story

09:55.899 --> 09:57.466
like the guy with the hook.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.948
No, i-it's true.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.602
The scientists
that proved the big bang,

10:02.645 --> 10:05.387
they thought their sensors
needed cleaning

10:05.430 --> 10:07.650
until someone pointed out
that they were picking up

10:07.694 --> 10:10.348
cosmic background radiation
from the singularity.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.741
They won the Nobel.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.874
Not the scientists
that came up with the theory.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.790
So you're saying they could
steal our Nobel Prize?

10:16.833 --> 10:19.140
Yes.
That's terrible.

10:20.837 --> 10:21.969
Good news, though:

10:22.012 --> 10:23.971
Now we have something
we can talk about.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.150
Hey, you wanted
to see me?

10:29.193 --> 10:31.065
Yeah, come on in.
Okay.

10:31.108 --> 10:32.806
Close the door.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.546
Okay.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.638
Have a seat.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.465
Do I have to?

10:40.509 --> 10:42.163
You really do.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.690
So, I talked
to your supervisor,

10:47.734 --> 10:49.997
and she said that she
never stopped you

10:50.040 --> 10:52.739
from working on my team,
because you never asked her.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.305
Really?

10:54.349 --> 10:55.785
Oh, you know, you should know,

10:55.829 --> 10:57.657
she's been taking
our new antidepressant,

10:57.700 --> 11:00.921
and lying is one
of the main side effects.

11:00.964 --> 11:03.445
Why don't you want
to work with me?

11:03.488 --> 11:05.621
I know I can be tough,
but that's just 'cause

11:05.665 --> 11:08.102
I'm surrounded by
useless idiots.

11:08.145 --> 11:10.104
No, it's not that.

11:10.147 --> 11:11.453
Then why?

11:11.496 --> 11:14.108
Honestly, I don't know
if I'm up to it.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.936
You know,
the last project I managed

11:15.979 --> 11:18.112
was my high school yearbook.And?

11:18.155 --> 11:21.332
And that was the year
we didn't have one.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.899
Apparently, the printers
won't make them

11:22.943 --> 11:24.509
without getting paid.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.163
What happened to the money?

11:26.207 --> 11:28.905
Uh, if I didn't know then, I'm
not gonna magically know now.

11:28.949 --> 11:31.473
Plus, you know,
I didn't go to college.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.562
I'd be in charge of people
that are far more educated

11:33.605 --> 11:35.782
with more experience;
what if they don't listen to me?

11:35.825 --> 11:37.479
Then you be really mean to them.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.002
Have I taught you nothing?

11:40.264 --> 11:42.266
Penny, everybody
feels like you do.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.703
Like they're not good enough,

11:43.746 --> 11:45.574
not smart enough.What, even you?

11:45.617 --> 11:47.837
Of course.Dr. Rostenkowski,
you wanted me...

11:47.881 --> 11:50.361
Hey, did they not teach
knocking at Stanford? Get out!

11:53.277 --> 11:54.801
[chuckles] I love that kid.

11:59.414 --> 12:00.458
There you are.

12:00.502 --> 12:02.199
Dr. Cooper, hello.

12:02.243 --> 12:05.028
Hello to you, too. Now stop
trying to steal our Nobel Prize.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.464
You come up with your own idea.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.466
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.382
Wouldn't that
be something, though?

12:12.514 --> 12:14.124
Well, too bad.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.300
This discovery belongs
to Amy and me.[sighs]

12:16.344 --> 12:17.519
Look, Dr. Cooper,

12:17.562 --> 12:19.129
we all want a Nobel Prize.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.175
Super-asymmetry could be the
breakthrough that gets us there.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.960
But we can't fight over credit;
we have to work together.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.354
So...

12:26.397 --> 12:28.269
you're saying
that the four of us

12:28.312 --> 12:31.576
should just agree
to share this discovery?

12:31.620 --> 12:33.491
Well, no,
unfortunately,

12:33.535 --> 12:35.319
only three people
can share a Nobel.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.843
Oh, that's right.

12:39.149 --> 12:40.368
So he's out?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.763
No, I'm not out.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.636
So he's out?

12:47.679 --> 12:48.985
Neither of us is out.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.770
We think that
the three physicists

12:50.813 --> 12:53.468
should be the ones to win
the Nobel Prize for physics.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.601
Wait, so you want
to cut Amy out?

12:56.645 --> 12:58.212
No, of course not.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.344
We don't want to,
but we're going to.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.130
But she's my wife.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.914
Yes, exactly,
she's your wife.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.350
And she's a neuroscientist.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.049
It's like, what's she
even doing on this paper?

13:10.833 --> 13:13.880
It just raises questions.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.707
Look, Fermilab
is going to recommend

13:15.751 --> 13:17.318
the three of us
to the Nobel Committee.

13:17.361 --> 13:20.190
The best chance we have is if
your university does the same.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.238
I see.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.807
So you really think that
I'm the kind of man who would

13:27.850 --> 13:29.112
sell out his partner
for the chance

13:29.156 --> 13:30.461
of winning a Nobel Prize?

13:30.505 --> 13:31.811
Are you?

13:32.899 --> 13:34.509
Boy, I hope not.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.340
I can't believe
Penny doesn't want

13:39.383 --> 13:41.690
to head up my
sales team.
That's too bad.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.953
But it's her decision,
not yours.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.216
Do you hear how dumb you sound?

13:47.391 --> 13:49.785
Why does this matter
to you so much?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.874
Because I believe in her,
and I make people better.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.049
It's what I do.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.398
Against their will?

13:54.442 --> 13:56.052
It's no fun if they want to.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.619
That's just called watching.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.187
Look at Howard.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.884
He was a disaster
when I met him.

14:01.928 --> 14:05.366
Now he's a foxy astronaut
with a hot wife.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.542
Wait, he always wanted
to be an astronaut.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.065
He thinks that, too.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.937
That's how good I am.

14:12.242 --> 14:13.678
Wait, so what
are you gonna do?

14:13.722 --> 14:15.332
Just badger her
until she says yes?

14:15.376 --> 14:18.553
Mm, that may have worked on you,
but she's too smart for that.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.122
Well, if you like fixing people,
I could use some help.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.732
Raj.

14:23.775 --> 14:26.126
Why do you think you stopped
wearing Crocs and socks?

14:26.169 --> 14:29.999
Uh, well, one day I just woke up
and realized they looked silly.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.436
Yes, you did.
All on your own.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.918
[whispering]:
That's how good I am.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.489
[clucking tongue]

14:41.532 --> 14:43.360
What's wrong?

14:43.404 --> 14:45.319
Why do you assume
something's wrong?

14:45.362 --> 14:47.234
Because you haven't
touched your dinner,

14:47.277 --> 14:51.020
and you're literally ticking
like a bomb about to go off.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.109
Oh, Amy.

14:53.153 --> 14:56.243
You see through me
like one of Penny's shirts.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.420
Just tell me.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.990
I talked to Doctors Pemberton
and Campbell today.

15:04.033 --> 15:07.776
They reminded me that only three
people can share a Nobel Prize.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.734
Their university
is recommending

15:09.778 --> 15:11.606
the two of them and me.

15:11.649 --> 15:13.651
And they want Caltech
to do the same.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.481
Oh.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.614
They say, if we present
a united front,

15:19.657 --> 15:21.746
we have a much better shot
at winning.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.576
Well, you know,

15:25.620 --> 15:26.969
that makes sense.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.232
Oh, but don't worry.
I won't do that to you.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.411
Maybe you should.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.978
What?

15:37.588 --> 15:39.808
This has been
your lifelong dream.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.680
And you may not get
another chance.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.770
I don't want to be the reason
that you don't win a Nobel.

15:45.814 --> 15:49.165
You're the only
reason I deserve one.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.692
But if your best shot
is with them,

15:54.736 --> 15:56.216
I think you should take it.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.655
Is this really
what you want me to do?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.659
I just want you to be happy.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.140
Thank you.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.145
[clicking tongue]

16:17.106 --> 16:19.282
Hey. How long have you
been sitting there?

16:19.326 --> 16:20.805
Long enough for two
of your neighbors

16:20.849 --> 16:23.243
to ask if I was lost
and looking for my mother.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.767
I'm not changing my mind,
Bernie.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.377
That's okay. I'm sorry.

16:27.421 --> 16:30.032
It was wrong of me to badger you
into doing something

16:30.076 --> 16:31.425
that made you uncomfortable.

16:31.468 --> 16:32.426
Thank you.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.645
Mm, it's probably
for the best.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.473
I need someone
who's strong and confident

16:36.517 --> 16:39.215
to head up my sales team,
so I'm giving it to Karen.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.652
What... Karen?
Well, what's the job?

16:41.696 --> 16:45.134
Eating my yogurt and
then lying about it?

16:45.178 --> 16:46.657
I'm just saying.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.659
She went to college.
She's really smart.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.313
Well, I'm smarter than Karen.

16:50.357 --> 16:54.448
I can read the word "Penny"
on a cup of yogurt.

16:54.491 --> 16:55.797
Why are you getting so upset?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.799
I'm agreeing with you.
This is a big job,

16:57.842 --> 16:59.496
and I need someone
who's up to it.

16:59.540 --> 17:02.673
I am up to it.
I'm just nervous about it.I know.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.501
And that's why
I don't want to pressure you

17:04.545 --> 17:06.721
into doing something that you
clearly don't want to do.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.505
I know what you're up to.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.507
Is it working?

17:10.551 --> 17:12.248
Yes.

17:14.381 --> 17:18.080
So I'll see you
Monday morning?Yes.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.735
I bet I can make
that girl president.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.565
[intercom beeps]

17:24.608 --> 17:26.088
RECEPTIONIST:
Uh, President Siebert,
Dr. Cooper is...

17:26.132 --> 17:28.090
I need to talk to
you about the paper

17:28.134 --> 17:30.353
that Dr. Fowler
and I published.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.355
Send him in.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.965
Amy and I did this together,

17:34.009 --> 17:35.924
and I will not
be part of an award

17:35.967 --> 17:37.926
that does not recognize
the value of her contributions.

17:37.969 --> 17:40.537
So you either include both of us
in the recommendation letter,

17:40.581 --> 17:42.061
or don't bother writing one.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.367
I hope you know
that's going to cause a fight

17:44.411 --> 17:46.195
between us
and the Fermilab team.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.632
If it's a fight that doesn't
involve any touching,

17:48.676 --> 17:50.895
risk of physical harm
or uncomfortable eye contact

17:50.939 --> 17:52.810
'cause it's happening online
or through intermediaries,

17:52.854 --> 17:54.638
I say bring it.

17:54.682 --> 17:57.076
All right.
I respect your decision.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.208
You do?

17:59.252 --> 18:01.863
Yes. You and Dr. Fowler
have my full support.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.995
Oh, okay.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.563
I anticipated
a little more pushback.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.957
Sorry, my job here
is to serve your needs,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.437
both academic and personal.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.092
Huh.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.050
Well, now I'm filled with
all this nervous energy.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.052
I don't know quite
what to do with it.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.185
We have a fully equipped
gymnasium.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.925
Yeah... Really?

18:20.969 --> 18:23.058
Where's that?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.668
It's part of the new
sports complex.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.627
Oh.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.411
And where is that?

18:28.455 --> 18:29.978
Come on, I'll show you.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.113
Are there monkey bars?

18:40.858 --> 18:42.469
All right, now,
I'm sure some of you

18:42.512 --> 18:43.948
are wondering,
"Who is this woman?

18:43.992 --> 18:46.734
"How did she get to be
in charge of the sales team?

18:46.777 --> 18:49.519
Is it because she's friends
with Dr. Rostenkowski?"

18:49.563 --> 18:51.956
Because she is.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.481
"Is it because she was
Miss Cornhusker 2001

18:54.524 --> 18:56.874
and still fits
in those very same jeans?"

18:56.918 --> 18:58.485
'Cause she was, and she does,

18:58.528 --> 19:00.095
and they're actually
a little baggy.

19:01.836 --> 19:04.317
Or is it because she's
the best damn salesperson here?

19:04.360 --> 19:05.796
Because I am.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.322
Now that we're clear on that,
here are the drug specs

19:09.365 --> 19:11.106
and marketing strategy
for Inflamminex.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.675
Which, now that I say it out
loud, might be a placeholder.

19:14.718 --> 19:17.330
By tomorrow, I want everyone to
have this committed to memory.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.332
Do you have it
committed to memory?

19:19.375 --> 19:21.334
You want to have
a contest, Karen?

19:21.377 --> 19:23.379
Winner gets a yogurt.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.208
No, boss.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.558
All right, now we all know
what we need to do.

19:28.602 --> 19:29.777
Let's go do it.

19:30.865 --> 19:33.737
R-Right now.
Get out of here. Go.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.654
That was
really impressive.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.178
Damn right it
was impressive.

19:39.221 --> 19:41.832
