♪ Yeah, come on, hey, look ♪

00:05.612 --> 00:08.283
Hey, baby girl. It's Daddy.

00:08.283 --> 00:10.889
I'm on my way to the hospital
to see you be born.

00:10.889 --> 00:13.193
Little Ophelia.
(chuckles)

00:13.193 --> 00:15.698
You know, your mom wanted you
to be named Riana.

00:15.698 --> 00:17.434
(clicks tongue)
I wore her down.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.205
(chuckles)
(phone rings)

00:19.205 --> 00:21.409
Oh.

00:21.409 --> 00:24.583
It's like she knows
we're talking about her.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.620
Hey, Mama Bear.

00:26.620 --> 00:29.492
Roger, you said you wouldn't
miss another one of these,

00:29.492 --> 00:30.895
not after you missed RJ.

00:30.895 --> 00:33.734
Yeah, well, I‐‐ who knew
he would slip out so fast?

00:33.734 --> 00:36.439
(groans)
I'm already eight centimeters

00:36.439 --> 00:37.709
and ready to pop.

00:37.709 --> 00:39.613
Okay, well, I'm ten minutes out.

00:39.613 --> 00:41.684
No popping till I get there.
Cross your legs or something.

00:41.684 --> 00:43.420
Not funny. Not...
(line clicks)

00:43.420 --> 00:45.324

Stoller Autos. Shots fired.

01:36.927 --> 01:39.031
Uh, don't. Please.

01:39.031 --> 01:41.670
Hey, look, my‐my wife,

01:41.670 --> 01:45.043
at this minute, is about
to give birth to my baby girl.

01:45.043 --> 01:47.047
I‐I don't know
if you're a parent or not,

01:47.047 --> 01:49.953
but... (groans)
I'm begging you, man.

01:49.953 --> 01:52.424
Please, don't...

01:52.424 --> 01:56.232
Don't make my daughter
and my son at home...

01:57.067 --> 01:59.539
...grow up without a father,
man.

01:59.539 --> 02:01.643
(siren wailing in distance)
I'm begging you. Please.

02:04.883 --> 02:07.488
On the ground.

02:07.488 --> 02:09.391
(whispers): Come on, man.
Facedown.

02:17.909 --> 02:20.413
Close your eyes.

02:22.652 --> 02:23.954
Bam! You're dead.

02:23.954 --> 02:25.525
What? Wh‐What did I do wrong?

02:25.525 --> 02:26.794
I checked left,
then I checked right!

02:26.794 --> 02:28.062
But you didn't check
left again.

02:28.062 --> 02:29.699
And then an 18‐wheeler
tractor‐trailer

02:29.699 --> 02:32.337
came out of nowhere and, <i>bam,</i>
hit the side of your car.

02:32.337 --> 02:34.543
You're dead.
(scoffs)

02:34.543 --> 02:36.479
Tractor‐trailers can't drive
on residential streets.

02:36.479 --> 02:37.982
Okay. So he gets a ticket

02:37.982 --> 02:39.986
and you get dead.
(sighs)

02:39.986 --> 02:41.590
You're making me
a nervous wreck.

02:41.590 --> 02:43.928
Okay. Well,
it's better a nervous one

02:43.928 --> 02:46.867
than a "bloody pileup on
the side of the highway" kind.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.971
Okay? Let's ease in.

02:53.914 --> 02:55.885
(whistling)

02:58.022 --> 02:59.626
What is that?

02:59.626 --> 03:01.830
I call this
the Soup Test.

03:01.830 --> 03:05.303
A little trick to help you avoid
quick starts and stops.

03:05.303 --> 03:06.974
Now,

03:06.974 --> 03:09.445
put your hands up
at ten and two.

03:10.380 --> 03:12.719
That's 2:30.

03:12.719 --> 03:14.589
That's 2:57.
Okay.

03:14.589 --> 03:16.425
Right there. Now,

03:16.425 --> 03:18.363
you keep your eye on the road.

03:18.363 --> 03:19.766
I'll worry about the soup.

03:19.766 --> 03:20.935
Just nice
and steady.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.404
Eyes on the road,
okay?

03:22.404 --> 03:24.943
Even if another car
suddenly stops in front of you

03:24.943 --> 03:26.479
or your phone rings

03:26.479 --> 03:28.349
or a bee flies in. A bee.

03:28.349 --> 03:29.886
And it just lands right here
on your nose. Keep...

03:29.886 --> 03:30.821
W‐Watch the road.

03:30.821 --> 03:32.024
(tires screech)

03:32.024 --> 03:33.527
(shouts)
Hot!

03:33.527 --> 03:34.829
I can't deal with this.
I'm done.
Hey.

03:34.829 --> 03:36.667
Hey. Hey. Riana!

03:36.667 --> 03:38.036
Where you going? Riana!

03:38.036 --> 03:39.038
I'm walking home!

03:39.038 --> 03:40.040
Enjoy your soup!

03:40.040 --> 03:41.910
But you got to put the brake on!

03:41.910 --> 03:42.779
Hey!

03:42.779 --> 03:44.549
You got to put it in...

03:54.836 --> 03:57.642
I should've went with gazpacho.

04:02.017 --> 04:05.023
MOLLY: <i>I need to know why.</i>
<i>Why'd you end it?</i>

04:05.023 --> 04:06.760
'Cause my dad killed Ben's dog.

04:08.463 --> 04:10.367
<i>You tell me what you want me</i>
<i>to do, and I'll do it.</i>

04:10.367 --> 04:11.837
MOLLY: <i>You need to figure it out</i>
<i>with your dad.</i>

04:11.837 --> 04:13.039
That's what I want.

04:23.627 --> 04:25.898
(indistinct chatter)

04:25.898 --> 04:28.169
(lock buzzes)

04:28.169 --> 04:30.373
(door opens)

04:35.818 --> 04:38.089
(chuckles)

04:38.089 --> 04:40.093
(grunts)

04:43.433 --> 04:45.203
Well, look who's back.

04:45.203 --> 04:47.207
A ray of sunshine

04:47.207 --> 04:48.777
on a rainy day.

04:48.777 --> 04:50.213
What's up, son?

04:50.213 --> 04:52.985
You just in the
neighborhood?

04:52.985 --> 04:54.989
If you knew about that dog,

04:54.989 --> 04:57.127
then you know
who it belonged to.

04:57.127 --> 04:58.931
So why'd you kill it?
Says the guy

04:58.931 --> 05:01.335
who threatened to kill me.
Answer the question.

05:02.404 --> 05:04.509
I never meant for that pup
to get hurt.

05:04.509 --> 05:06.813
I asked the
wrong people

05:06.813 --> 05:08.817
to send a message
that I needed to see you.

05:08.817 --> 05:10.955
And I think
they just misinterpreted.

05:10.955 --> 05:12.959
(chuckles)

05:14.461 --> 05:17.100
So that's your idea
of reaching out?

05:17.100 --> 05:19.706
Sounds like you need
to get some new people, Dad.

05:19.706 --> 05:23.446
Well, now, that's pretty easy
to say from where you sit.

05:23.446 --> 05:24.849
You ever been on the inside?

05:24.849 --> 05:26.686
I didn't put you here.
No.

05:26.686 --> 05:28.991
No, you didn't. I know that.

05:28.991 --> 05:31.863
I'm just trying to tell you
why it got out of hand

05:31.863 --> 05:34.869
and maybe, you know, that I'm...

05:34.869 --> 05:36.973
sorry.

05:38.744 --> 05:40.213
What?

05:40.213 --> 05:41.883
You heard me.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.887
I know what I
put you through.

05:43.887 --> 05:46.025
Hit you more times
than I should've.

05:46.025 --> 05:49.264
Now, some of that was
drinking, but not all of it.

05:49.264 --> 05:52.037
I was raised that way, Martin.

05:52.037 --> 05:54.174
I'm not trying
to make excuses here.

05:54.174 --> 05:55.210
But I'm just telling you...

05:55.210 --> 05:56.813
What are you doing?

05:56.813 --> 05:58.182
What is this right now?

05:58.182 --> 05:59.519
Nothing.

05:59.519 --> 06:00.988
Just a little
conversation.

06:00.988 --> 06:03.560
I want to maybe, you know,
be able to check in

06:03.560 --> 06:04.829
every once in a while.

06:07.969 --> 06:09.772
Hey, you want to do
something for me?

06:09.772 --> 06:12.812
Stay away from me
and anybody that I care about.

06:12.812 --> 06:16.118
You got that?

06:33.219 --> 06:35.791
I practically suffered
third‐degree burns,

06:35.791 --> 06:38.029
and I smelled like chowder
for the rest of the day

06:38.029 --> 06:41.670
because Riana can't seem
to park with any nuance.

06:41.670 --> 06:43.874
Mm‐hmm.
"Mm‐hmm"?

06:43.874 --> 06:45.310
What is that? What
do you mean, "mm‐hmm"?

06:45.310 --> 06:47.782
That was the end, right?
I was responding to you.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.086
Ah! I can't work
like this.

06:50.086 --> 06:51.556
Where's Riggs?

06:51.556 --> 06:53.760
Took off three days ago
without any word.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.063
And here it is
that I'm thinking

06:55.063 --> 06:56.031
that he's changed.

06:56.031 --> 06:56.966
Mm‐hmm.

06:58.970 --> 06:59.972
Scorsese...

06:59.972 --> 07:00.908
What's up with him?

07:00.908 --> 07:03.513
Banter deficit.
Start talking.

07:03.513 --> 07:04.949
Vic's Michael Diamond,

07:04.949 --> 07:06.820
owner of Diamond
Global Imports.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.189
His bodyguard said
that he was...

07:08.189 --> 07:11.195
Mikey "the Bullfrog" Diamond.
Bullfrog?

07:11.195 --> 07:12.631
That's a nickname?

07:12.631 --> 07:15.804
On account of his
gastrointestinal issues.

07:15.804 --> 07:16.973
MURTAUGH:
I've studied this guy.

07:16.973 --> 07:19.812
West Coast
crime syndicate capo.

07:21.181 --> 07:23.319
He went legit
about ten years ago.

07:23.319 --> 07:24.822
SCORSESE:
Not sure it took.

07:24.822 --> 07:27.093
Pretty sure this is
a mob execution.

07:27.093 --> 07:28.930
One to the head,
one to the chest.

07:28.930 --> 07:31.101
Long‐range shot, about
a hundred yards out.

07:31.101 --> 07:33.038
One story up.

07:33.038 --> 07:34.675
Yeah. At least.

07:34.675 --> 07:37.213
How'd you know that?

07:39.284 --> 07:40.353
All right, people,

07:40.353 --> 07:43.994
we have
a hot crime scene here.

07:43.994 --> 07:45.864
I want zero contamination.

07:45.864 --> 07:48.703
We need to be
very methodical...
RIGGS: Hey, Rog!

07:49.872 --> 07:51.375
Where the hell
have you been, Riggs?

07:51.375 --> 07:53.713
Uh, finding the murder weapon.

07:53.713 --> 07:55.617
The murder weapon, which
you are now contaminating.

07:55.617 --> 07:58.289
Could you put it down?
Hey, why don't you relax.

07:58.289 --> 07:59.391
All right?
I'm not touching it.

07:59.391 --> 08:02.096
The gun, which you are holding,

08:02.096 --> 08:04.836
is an M25 bolt‐action.

08:04.836 --> 08:07.340
Our suspect is a professional
contract killer,

08:07.340 --> 08:09.144
about five foot ten
and a half.

08:09.144 --> 08:11.916
He smokes Putnam
filtered cigarettes.

08:11.916 --> 08:14.254
If you run any prints on him,

08:14.254 --> 08:16.325
the name "Frank Kelso"

08:16.325 --> 08:17.728
will pop up.

08:17.728 --> 08:19.331
What is it, Riggs?
What?

08:19.331 --> 08:21.870
Oh, sorry, are we
still worried about

08:21.870 --> 08:23.005
contaminating
the crime scene?

08:23.005 --> 08:25.009
We are always concerned

08:25.009 --> 08:27.080
with contaminating
crime sc...

08:27.080 --> 08:28.617
Oh, dear.

08:30.654 --> 08:31.756
See, Rog,

08:31.756 --> 08:33.693
you do need me.

08:36.633 --> 08:38.637
♪ ♪

08:41.676 --> 08:43.914
(siren wailing in distance)

08:43.914 --> 08:46.251
I mean, I drive
all the way down there,

08:46.251 --> 08:49.057
you know, expecting the S. O. B.
to say just about anything...

08:51.428 --> 08:55.102
...and then he goes and says
the one thing I didn't expect.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.173
CAHILL:
He's sorry.

09:00.179 --> 09:02.751
I mean, what's he
trying to pull?

09:02.751 --> 09:05.991
You went down there
looking for confrontation.

09:05.991 --> 09:07.861
He didn't give it to you,
now you're furious.

09:07.861 --> 09:09.264
But what if he had
given it to you?

09:09.264 --> 09:11.869
What then?

09:11.869 --> 09:15.042
I don't know.

09:17.046 --> 09:18.783
It's messing with
my head, I know that.

09:18.783 --> 09:22.390
Well, you don't have to be
in Texas for that to happen.

09:22.390 --> 09:26.331
Every move you make is
a response to this guy.

09:26.331 --> 09:28.870
You're letting him
control your life.

09:30.339 --> 09:32.010
Not like I got a choice
in the matter.

09:32.010 --> 09:34.782
Talk to him,
don't talk to him.

09:34.782 --> 09:38.222
Either way,
you have to let go

09:38.222 --> 09:40.827
of all the rage and hurt
you carry inside.

09:42.430 --> 09:44.935
Or you'll never find
the peace you're looking for.

09:44.935 --> 09:46.706
Can't say "never."

09:46.706 --> 09:48.308
I mean, he's got to die
at some point, right?

09:48.308 --> 09:49.411
Right?

09:53.720 --> 09:55.757
Meet Frank Kelso.

09:55.757 --> 09:59.197
16 years I've been
chasing this guy.

09:59.197 --> 10:00.934
We used to call him
Murtaugh's white whale.

10:00.934 --> 10:01.969
You know, <i>Moby Dick?</i>

10:01.969 --> 10:03.138
We're familiar.

10:03.138 --> 10:04.307
What's up with all
the notebooks?

10:04.307 --> 10:07.514
I started with
the Ray Stoller killing,

10:07.514 --> 10:08.817
from the night
Riana was born.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.152
Then I worked backward.

10:10.152 --> 10:14.895
Every hit that he might
have ever been involved with.

10:14.895 --> 10:17.100
And then back to
the office supply store,

10:17.100 --> 10:18.469
'cause I had to buy more books

10:18.469 --> 10:21.041
to keep track of
Frank since Stoller.

10:21.041 --> 10:22.110
That's how I was gonna
bring him in.

10:22.110 --> 10:24.180
Why didn't you just buy them
all at the same time?

10:25.483 --> 10:27.053
Yeah, tha‐that would
have worked, too.

10:27.053 --> 10:29.792
Are all of the notebooks
as empty as this one?

10:29.792 --> 10:32.998
Frankie, uh, turned out
to be a lot harder to find

10:32.998 --> 10:34.902
than I expected.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.073
I kept that picture
of the Stoller family

10:37.073 --> 10:39.945
to remind me <i>why</i>
I keep looking.

10:41.181 --> 10:43.185
Any questions?

10:43.185 --> 10:44.287
Any questions that

10:44.287 --> 10:48.095
do not have anything
to do with notebook purchases?

10:48.095 --> 10:50.934
How do you propose we find him?

10:50.934 --> 10:52.938
Frankie Kelso is
a professional ghost,

10:52.938 --> 10:54.975
capable of vanishing
without a trace.

10:54.975 --> 10:57.280
I say we start
with notebook number one.

10:57.280 --> 11:00.052
And then we painstakingly
and methodically go through

11:00.052 --> 11:01.454
all of these books...
BAILEY: Found him.

11:02.524 --> 11:04.227
Screen grab

11:04.227 --> 11:06.064
from the garage's security
camera shows Kelso

11:06.064 --> 11:07.868
getting out of his car.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.437
And a BOLO just spotted
the same car

11:09.437 --> 11:11.809
near a houseboat
on Terminal Island.

11:11.809 --> 11:13.546
Really?
Do you want me

11:13.546 --> 11:15.517
to put it in one of
the notebooks that you have?

11:19.023 --> 11:23.365
Take a tactical team with you
and go get your white whale.

11:30.513 --> 11:33.887
Trust me, you might want
body armor this time.

11:33.887 --> 11:36.124
Yeah, Rog. I'm not worried
about a 70‐year‐old man.

11:36.124 --> 11:38.529
Age is meaningless when you're
an unstoppable killing machine.

11:38.529 --> 11:40.600
You know, it's those funny
little nose and ear hairs

11:40.600 --> 11:43.105
on the killing machine
that throws me off, though.

11:55.597 --> 11:57.500
Wait. Hold up.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.037
Might be booby‐trapped.

11:59.037 --> 12:01.575
Trip wires, bombs,
state‐of‐the‐art weaponry.

12:01.575 --> 12:04.380
All right, we kick this door in,
we may as well be dead.

12:04.380 --> 12:06.519
Right, right, right.

12:06.519 --> 12:09.123
I wanted you
to kick it in.

12:24.888 --> 12:27.059
OFFICER: Living room clear!
OFFICER 2: Bathroom clear!

12:27.059 --> 12:29.898
Well, looks like your killing
machine's a little constipated.

12:29.898 --> 12:31.201
I knew it.

12:31.201 --> 12:32.336
He's gone.

12:32.336 --> 12:34.474
A ghost. A phantom.

12:34.474 --> 12:37.313
He's probably in... Mexico.
(boat motor revs)

12:37.313 --> 12:39.985
(scoffs)
Or a boat leaving
the marina.

13:04.935 --> 13:06.906
Call the Coast Guard.

13:06.906 --> 13:08.241
Don't let that boat
get to open water.

13:08.241 --> 13:09.310
Yes, sir.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.318
(sirens wailing)

13:36.464 --> 13:38.503
Damn it.

13:38.503 --> 13:40.405
COAST GUARD:
Unidentified fishing boat,
this is the Coast Guard.

13:40.405 --> 13:42.143
Return to harbor.

13:42.143 --> 13:45.449
Return to harbor immediately.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.654
TAC TEAM COMMANDER: All units,
suspect is not on the boat.

13:47.654 --> 13:49.591
Repeat. Boat is a decoy.

13:49.591 --> 13:52.129
Tough break, Murtaugh.

13:52.129 --> 13:54.400
Looks like he got away
from you again.

14:02.684 --> 14:03.753
Take the next left.

14:03.753 --> 14:06.959
You're getting sloppy
in your old age, Frankie.

14:06.959 --> 14:08.963
It's not like you to leave
your fingerprints behind.

14:08.963 --> 14:10.165
It's not like me
'cause it wasn't me.

14:10.165 --> 14:11.635
The prints were planted.

14:11.635 --> 14:13.639
So you're saying this
is all a‐a setup.

14:13.639 --> 14:15.142
Right.

14:15.142 --> 14:16.344
Nah, I ain't buying it.

14:16.344 --> 14:19.651
A leopard doesn't
change its stripes.
I said right.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.454
Turn right!

14:24.661 --> 14:27.534
How's your little girl,
by the way?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.403
At the moment?

14:29.403 --> 14:31.174
Probably worried sick

14:31.174 --> 14:33.378
that her dad's not home
to take her driving.

14:33.378 --> 14:34.681
Driving, already.

14:34.681 --> 14:36.585
Where does the time go?

14:38.355 --> 14:40.025
Pull back here.

14:47.239 --> 14:48.441
Now get out.

14:48.441 --> 14:51.715
Slowly.

14:51.715 --> 14:53.051
Give me your gun.

14:57.326 --> 14:59.497
Keep your hands where
I can see 'em.

14:59.497 --> 15:01.200
Move.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.405
Walk.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.512
Stop.

15:09.150 --> 15:10.586
Hey, look.

15:10.586 --> 15:12.056
You don't have to do this.

15:12.056 --> 15:13.592
Should've done it
a long time ago.

15:13.592 --> 15:15.262
Don't turn around.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.999
Hey, listen, man, t‐this...
Shh.

15:20.072 --> 15:22.076
(urinating)

15:22.076 --> 15:24.213
(exhales)

15:25.717 --> 15:28.088
There we go.

15:28.088 --> 15:30.793
Been holding it in

15:30.793 --> 15:33.465
since I clocked you cops
outside my place.

15:33.465 --> 15:34.735
(zipper closes)

15:34.735 --> 15:37.707
Dr. Levin says it's not good
for my prostate.

15:38.743 --> 15:40.479
Edward Levin?

15:40.479 --> 15:42.082
The urologist?

15:42.082 --> 15:43.284
You go to him, too?

15:43.284 --> 15:44.353
(smacks lips)

15:44.353 --> 15:46.257
He's a good man. Gentle.

15:46.257 --> 15:48.128
Take this.

15:48.128 --> 15:50.499
It's a phone number
I need you to run down for me.

15:50.499 --> 15:52.102
And why should I do that?

15:52.102 --> 15:53.371
Two reasons.

15:53.371 --> 15:54.841
So I don't shoot you,

15:54.841 --> 15:57.112
and 'cause I didn't
kill Diamond.

15:57.112 --> 16:00.118
That's the number
of who set me up.

16:10.673 --> 16:12.276
Do you want to, maybe,

16:12.276 --> 16:13.846
help me log the evidence
instead of sitting on it?

16:13.846 --> 16:15.081
No.

16:15.081 --> 16:17.219
For your information, Bailey,

16:17.219 --> 16:19.691
I'm gonna go through
Roger's notes

16:19.691 --> 16:21.662
on Kelso.

16:21.662 --> 16:23.431
Oh, the blank notes?

16:23.431 --> 16:27.774
Well... semi‐blank.

16:27.774 --> 16:30.245
Something about somebody
called "The Panther."

16:30.245 --> 16:33.519
And some sad little drawings
of a panther.

16:33.519 --> 16:35.155
(phone ringing)

16:35.155 --> 16:36.491
Yeah.

16:36.491 --> 16:37.594
MURTAUGH:
Riggs, it's me.

16:37.594 --> 16:40.432
Rog. How the heck did I beat you
back to the office?

16:40.432 --> 16:43.137
I mean, you were in a car,
and I was in a boat.

16:44.173 --> 16:46.143
That's a good question.

16:46.143 --> 16:48.181
Look, I need you to
run a number for me.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.485
Riggs, tell me you know
how to run a number.

16:50.485 --> 16:52.590
Of course I know
how to run a number, Roger.

16:52.590 --> 16:54.426
Give me a break.
(whistles) Hey.

16:54.426 --> 16:56.364
(whispering): Come here.
How do I run a number?

16:56.364 --> 16:57.432
All right, go.

16:57.432 --> 17:02.142
323‐555‐0129.

17:02.142 --> 17:03.211
Hey, why are you
giving this to me?

17:03.211 --> 17:05.382
Usually, the B‐team handles
this kind of thing.

17:05.382 --> 17:06.718
Because I trust you.

17:06.718 --> 17:08.354
You're the best damn cop I know.

17:09.758 --> 17:11.795
"You're the best
damn cop I know"?

17:11.795 --> 17:13.766
What? I don't
tell him that enough.

17:18.474 --> 17:20.478
Murtaugh's in trouble.

17:20.478 --> 17:22.482
RIGGS:
I mean, there's not much.

17:22.482 --> 17:24.821
You know, there was a mention of
somebody called "The Panther,"

17:24.821 --> 17:26.490
and then a list of podcasts
he wanted to download.

17:26.490 --> 17:28.862
Okay, The Panther
was Kelso's contact,

17:28.862 --> 17:31.167
the broker who hired him out,
gave him his targets.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.438
His real name
was Danny... something.

17:33.438 --> 17:35.208
BAILEY:
Danny Mancini.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.179
No current address;
he was born in Hollywood.

17:37.179 --> 17:39.183
He's been in and out of prison
for the past decade.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.588
San Quentin, Lompoc, Amarillo.

17:41.588 --> 17:43.224
Texas?

17:43.224 --> 17:44.460
You know another Amarillo?

17:44.460 --> 17:45.596
If Kelso's gonna lay low,

17:45.596 --> 17:47.199
this might be
his first stop.

17:47.199 --> 17:48.234
You okay?

17:49.269 --> 17:51.207
I got to make a phone call.

17:53.779 --> 17:56.450
Two visits, and a phone call?

17:56.450 --> 17:58.756
I feel positively courted.

17:58.756 --> 18:00.492
I knew this was gonna be
a mistake.

18:00.492 --> 18:02.597
I'm betting you got
a favor to ask me,

18:02.597 --> 18:04.601
so go ahead and ask it.
What do you need?

18:04.601 --> 18:08.341
Four years ago, you served time
with a Danny Mancini.

18:08.341 --> 18:09.577
You remember him?

18:09.577 --> 18:11.581
Yeah, he wasn't
in my cellblock, but I knew him.

18:11.581 --> 18:12.950
Not well.

18:12.950 --> 18:14.521
You know where I can find him?

18:14.521 --> 18:17.325
Well, he still has some crew
serving here, so...

18:17.325 --> 18:19.597
Not the friendliest cats,
but I'll ask around.

18:19.597 --> 18:21.668
Now, see, that wasn't
so hard, was it?

18:21.668 --> 18:23.605
It's important, okay?

18:23.605 --> 18:25.609
Yeah, it must be
if you're calling me.

18:27.747 --> 18:29.751
(phone beeps)

18:34.627 --> 18:36.631
(opera music playing)

18:38.367 --> 18:41.307
You set me up, Danny?

18:41.307 --> 18:42.643
Frankie.

18:42.643 --> 18:43.979
Long time.

18:43.979 --> 18:45.983
You don't look happy to see me.

18:45.983 --> 18:47.754
'Cause you're a fugitive.

18:47.754 --> 18:49.289
You hit Mikey Diamond.

18:49.289 --> 18:50.425
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:50.425 --> 18:51.962
This is The Panther?

18:51.962 --> 18:54.734
I‐I had a whole
different image in my head.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.838
More sleek and catlike.

18:58.341 --> 18:59.744
You set me up, didn't you?

18:59.744 --> 19:00.813
Easy, Frank.

19:00.813 --> 19:02.215
You texted me,
and set a meet.

19:02.215 --> 19:03.251
Same as you used to.

19:03.251 --> 19:04.353
I‐I swear to you.

19:04.353 --> 19:05.523
Frankie, it wasn't me.

19:05.523 --> 19:07.225
Then who?!

19:07.225 --> 19:09.396
We've known each
other a long time,

19:09.396 --> 19:11.535
so I'm gonna give you
the courtesy of counting

19:11.535 --> 19:13.572
before I put
a bullet in your head.

19:13.572 --> 19:14.674
One,

19:14.674 --> 19:15.643
(gun cocks)
two...

19:15.643 --> 19:16.778
Okay, wait.

19:16.778 --> 19:18.849
Wait. About
a month ago,

19:18.849 --> 19:21.655
a kid came by here, uh,
20‐something.

19:21.655 --> 19:24.259
Uh, said he had a job.

19:24.259 --> 19:25.729
He was asking questions
about you.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.567
Well, who was he?

19:27.567 --> 19:29.336
(scoffs)
I didn't get a name.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.942
Red hair, tall,

19:31.942 --> 19:33.812
lean, good shape.

19:33.812 --> 19:37.319
Oh, and he was tooling around
in a sweet vintage auto.

19:37.319 --> 19:39.991
(chuckles) Alfa Romeo,
convertible.

19:39.991 --> 19:41.293
Baby blue.

19:41.293 --> 19:42.964
(door opens, bells jingle)

19:45.368 --> 19:46.938
Customer.

19:49.978 --> 19:51.313
RIGGS:
Hi, there.

19:51.313 --> 19:53.685
I'm looking for something
really old,

19:53.685 --> 19:55.656
and I thought maybe
you could help me out.

19:55.656 --> 19:57.593
Sorry, we're closed.

19:57.593 --> 19:59.463
You know, it's actually‐‐
it's two things.

19:59.463 --> 20:01.735
It's two things that
I'm looking for.

20:01.735 --> 20:03.906
One's, like, middle‐age, oldish,

20:03.906 --> 20:05.910
and the other one's
extremely old.

20:05.910 --> 20:08.782
Find yourself
another antique shop.

20:08.782 --> 20:09.951
Uh, no.

20:09.951 --> 20:12.355
This is the antique
shop I want.

20:12.355 --> 20:13.525
I mean, because
you're the guy making

20:13.525 --> 20:14.661
all the deals, right?

20:14.661 --> 20:16.030
I mean, you're
The Panther.

20:16.030 --> 20:18.034
(gun cocks)
Nah.

20:18.034 --> 20:19.269
Not quick enough, buddy.

20:19.269 --> 20:21.541
Tell me where my partner is,
or I'm‐a put one in your head.

20:21.541 --> 20:24.914
Riggs, right here.

20:24.914 --> 20:27.085
Don't need anybody
getting crazy.

20:27.085 --> 20:28.689
I got everything under control.

20:28.689 --> 20:30.926
Tell your partner
to drop his gun.

20:30.926 --> 20:33.397
Riggs, Frankie,
Frankie, Riggs.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.606
Doesn't look like you got
everything under control, Rog.

20:37.606 --> 20:38.942
MURTAUGH: Yeah, well,
it's deceptive...

20:47.425 --> 20:48.662
Who the hell are these guys?

20:49.597 --> 20:50.599
Mike Diamond's guys.

20:50.599 --> 20:51.735
They think I killed their boss.

20:51.735 --> 20:54.106
Maybe because you did
kill their boss?

20:54.106 --> 20:56.010
No, that's what
I'm trying to tell...

21:04.092 --> 21:05.428
(gun clicks)

21:14.847 --> 21:16.684
Put the weapon down.

21:23.130 --> 21:25.034
Well, Rog.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.105
Finally caught your big fish
here. How does it feel?

21:27.105 --> 21:29.109
Not too good.

21:29.109 --> 21:30.913
Why is that?

21:30.913 --> 21:32.115
He didn't do it.

21:38.895 --> 21:41.467
MURTAUGH: My gut says
that Kelso didn't do this.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.070
Despite all of the evidence
that says he did?

21:43.070 --> 21:44.206
Yes.
Roger,
you've been chasing

21:44.206 --> 21:46.076
this guy
for over a decade,

21:46.076 --> 21:47.680
for doing exactly this.
Mm, right...

21:47.680 --> 21:48.815
Don't forget
about the abduction.

21:48.815 --> 21:50.719
Yeah.
That's my point exactly.

21:50.719 --> 21:54.025
Why abduct me if he could've
just fled the scene?

21:54.025 --> 21:56.096
Gee, Rog, this guy pees
in front of you

21:56.096 --> 21:57.265
and all of a sudden
you're Patty Hearst.

21:57.265 --> 21:59.102
Like, what happened to you?
Whoa, whoa, he peed on you?

21:59.102 --> 22:00.539
He didn't pee on me.

22:00.539 --> 22:01.708
No, not on him.
He peed in front of him.

22:01.708 --> 22:03.945
What, to show dominance?
RIGGS: I think so.

22:03.945 --> 22:06.483
He has what Dr. Levin
calls a lazy prostate.
(groans)

22:06.483 --> 22:09.055
We share urologists,
not symptoms.

22:09.055 --> 22:10.726
Ugh.
AVERY:
Roger, by all accounts,

22:10.726 --> 22:12.830
Frank Kelso is a hired killer.

22:12.830 --> 22:14.800
And I think it's possible
that he's not that guy anymore.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.103
RIGGS:
And I think it's possible

22:16.103 --> 22:17.540
you're the most gullible cop
in America.

22:17.540 --> 22:18.508
MURTAUGH:
And I think it's possible

22:18.508 --> 22:20.946
that after working with you
for two years,

22:20.946 --> 22:22.683
one day with a real human

22:22.683 --> 22:24.954
actually gives me clarity
to trust my gut.

22:24.954 --> 22:26.223
Oh, really? Now you're
trusting your gut?
Yes.

22:26.223 --> 22:27.826
RIGGS:
Well, I think it's possible

22:27.826 --> 22:28.862
you're just absolutely
ridiculous.
Yeah, I think...

22:28.862 --> 22:30.532
Maybe Frankie should be
your partner.
Yeah.

22:30.532 --> 22:31.768
Riggs. Riggs.
Possible‐‐
what?

22:31.768 --> 22:33.805
You have a call from
Amarillo Federal Prison.
Take a message.

22:33.805 --> 22:35.776
Because here's my thing...
What? What's your thing?

22:35.776 --> 22:36.978
Riggs, it's your...
I know who it is, Bailey.

22:41.588 --> 22:42.590
Send it to my cell.

22:42.590 --> 22:45.996
Would you please...? Something.
Yeah, I got it.

22:45.996 --> 22:48.535
Amarillo.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.737
Riggs's father.

22:49.737 --> 22:50.872
That's how worried he was.

22:50.872 --> 22:52.275
He actually called his dad
for help.

22:52.275 --> 22:53.612
That's how he
tracked you down.

22:53.612 --> 22:56.517
Mm. Hmm.

23:00.224 --> 23:01.828
Hey, what do you want?
(clears throat)

23:01.828 --> 23:04.099
NATHAN: Just wanted to see how
everything panned out.

23:04.099 --> 23:06.069
See if you maybe needed
anything else.

23:06.069 --> 23:07.071
Nope.

23:07.071 --> 23:08.541
Everything panned out.

23:08.541 --> 23:11.948
Well, that's good.

23:11.948 --> 23:14.252
Okay. Uh, bye.

23:14.252 --> 23:16.724
Uh, wait a second.
Hold on, man.

23:16.724 --> 23:18.962
I get one phone call
a week here.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.999
You hang up, you know,

23:20.999 --> 23:22.970
that's it for me
for another few days, so...

23:22.970 --> 23:24.205
I'm not doing this.

23:24.205 --> 23:26.878
You can give me 30 seconds.

23:26.878 --> 23:29.650
Why don't you humor me?

23:29.650 --> 23:31.019
Tell me something
about yourself.

23:46.249 --> 23:48.020
What do you want to know?

23:48.020 --> 23:49.122
I don't know.

23:49.122 --> 23:50.324
Tell me about where you live.

23:50.324 --> 23:53.197
What's your place like?

23:53.197 --> 23:57.271
What's my place like?

23:57.271 --> 24:00.144
Hell, I already know
you're a cop.

24:00.144 --> 24:04.085
Man, I did not see that coming
back then.

24:04.085 --> 24:06.991
Look, I know I was hard on you.

24:06.991 --> 24:09.229
You can say whatever you want
about me, but, uh,

24:09.229 --> 24:12.168
you sure turned out all right.

24:15.776 --> 24:16.911
30 seconds is up.

24:16.911 --> 24:18.046
Oh, don't hang up on me...

24:18.046 --> 24:19.315
INMATE: Who are we
talking to, Riggs?

24:19.315 --> 24:21.654
He hung up on me.

24:21.654 --> 24:23.323
Is there a problem
here, boys?
Yeah.

24:23.323 --> 24:25.896
I hear you've been asking
questions about Danny Mancini.

24:25.896 --> 24:27.900
He's got a lot
of friends in here.

24:40.291 --> 24:41.828
(coughing)

24:43.096 --> 24:45.669
RIANA:
<i>What kind of monster are you?</i>

24:45.669 --> 24:46.804
What‐‐
are you...? Hey.

24:46.804 --> 24:47.973
Excuse me, is she talking
to me like this?

24:47.973 --> 24:49.777
RIANA:
No, the other monster

24:49.777 --> 24:52.315
that got in my head
and ruined everything.

24:52.315 --> 24:55.254
Riana had her
driver's test today.

24:55.254 --> 24:57.726
I know.
And I failed, Dad.

24:57.726 --> 25:00.130
Well, listen,
a lot of people fail

25:00.130 --> 25:01.333
on their first time.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.636
Because you were in my head
the whole time.

25:02.636 --> 25:03.671
(gasps) Me?

25:03.671 --> 25:04.507
You!
MURTAUGH: Oh, co...

25:04.507 --> 25:06.176
Hands at ten and two
or you're dead.

25:06.176 --> 25:07.913
Check your mirrors
or you're dead.

25:07.913 --> 25:09.315
Feel the wheels,
turn into a skid,

25:09.315 --> 25:10.819
tap your breaks,
check for cats

25:10.819 --> 25:12.956
or bam! You're dead.

25:12.956 --> 25:14.158
MURTAUGH:
Well, here's the good news.

25:14.158 --> 25:16.229
You remembered all
my delicious tips.

25:16.229 --> 25:18.768
You must've been close
to passing.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.304
I didn't even make it
out of the parking lot.

25:20.304 --> 25:22.976
I got confused trying to
find the emergency brake

25:22.976 --> 25:24.713
and I pushed the
wrong button,

25:24.713 --> 25:26.049
so when the instructor
said it was over

25:26.049 --> 25:27.118
and I went to turn
the car off,

25:27.118 --> 25:28.387
I really turned
it back on.

25:28.387 --> 25:30.992
Then he got out and it
rolled over his foot

25:30.992 --> 25:32.261
and there was a crunch.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.837
So I hope you're happy.

25:38.741 --> 25:40.144
There was a crunch.

25:40.144 --> 25:41.079
TRISH:
She was a wreck.

25:41.079 --> 25:42.849
From the moment we got
there, it was awful.

25:42.849 --> 25:44.853
Poor kid.

25:44.853 --> 25:46.356
So I guess we should
be relieved, huh?

25:46.356 --> 25:48.226
Relieved?

25:48.226 --> 25:49.730
Roger, I'm not relieved.

25:49.730 --> 25:51.834
I need her to
start driving.

25:51.834 --> 25:53.437
Well, clearly,
she's not ready to drive.

25:53.437 --> 25:56.711
I mean, she ran over
the instructor's foot.

25:56.711 --> 25:58.180
Because you got in her head.

25:58.180 --> 26:00.150
Me?
You, Roger.

26:00.150 --> 26:02.321
Why is it always Roger?
Why is it always you?

26:02.321 --> 26:03.992
That is a very good question.

26:03.992 --> 26:06.363
You are the one
who took her driving

26:06.363 --> 26:08.066
and scared the hell out of her.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.939
I was teaching her
the horrors of the road.

26:10.939 --> 26:12.876
The Soup Test, Roger?

26:12.876 --> 26:14.445
Yeah.
When is she ever gonna
be driving with soup?

26:14.445 --> 26:16.717
She can go her whole life

26:16.717 --> 26:19.288
and never drive with soup.

26:19.288 --> 26:22.128
Maybe I was a little
overly cautious

26:22.128 --> 26:25.367
about teaching her how to drive.
Hmm.

26:25.367 --> 26:26.737
Fix it.

26:32.214 --> 26:33.718
Frankie.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.722
More questions?

26:35.722 --> 26:38.828
Or are you just going
to ask the same ones louder?

26:40.865 --> 26:43.938
You know, my partner thinks
you didn't kill this guy

26:43.938 --> 26:46.009
for some insane reason.

26:46.009 --> 26:47.846
What do you think?

26:49.883 --> 26:52.354
I think guys like you
never change.

26:52.354 --> 26:54.827
Now, my partner,

26:54.827 --> 26:57.164
he kept records of all
your greatest hits.

26:57.164 --> 26:59.970
Here, take a look. There's
pictures and everything.

26:59.970 --> 27:02.776
Okay, this is...
this is Dan Hughes.

27:02.776 --> 27:04.145
You got Robert Batts.

27:04.145 --> 27:06.416
Oh, Kevin Conti.

27:06.416 --> 27:09.455
Billy Grimes. Oh.

27:09.455 --> 27:12.428
Here's the one where you and
Rog started your love affair.

27:12.428 --> 27:14.232
Ray Stoller.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.743
And last, but not least.

27:19.743 --> 27:21.346
Now, Frankie,

27:21.346 --> 27:23.450
what do these guys
all have in common?

27:23.450 --> 27:25.420
One to the head and
one to the chest.

27:25.420 --> 27:27.759
Got a little bit of a pattern
emerging here, don't we?

27:27.759 --> 27:29.028
You got me.

27:29.028 --> 27:30.965
What's that?

27:30.965 --> 27:32.936
I did it.

27:34.973 --> 27:36.977
I killed Mike Diamond.

27:41.987 --> 27:44.893
I don't believe it.

27:44.893 --> 27:47.799
Yeah, me, either.

27:47.799 --> 27:49.135
Roger's right.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.872
He didn't do it.

27:50.872 --> 27:51.941
I don't...

27:51.941 --> 27:53.043
What just happened
in there?

27:58.453 --> 28:00.123
MURTAUGH:
<i>Trust me.</i>

28:00.123 --> 28:02.228
You are gonna hate me a lot less

28:02.228 --> 28:04.900
after you see this.

28:06.135 --> 28:08.039
Hey, baby girl, it's Daddy.

28:08.039 --> 28:10.410
I'm on my way to the hospital
to see you be born.

28:10.410 --> 28:13.250
Little Ophelia.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.519
Ophelia?

28:14.519 --> 28:16.824
It was that or Edwina.
Oh.

28:16.824 --> 28:18.026
That's your other
grandmother's name,

28:18.026 --> 28:20.230
which I don't think
anybody likes.
No.

28:20.230 --> 28:22.067
MURTAUGH:
There she is.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.338
The most beautiful,
precious girl in the world.

28:24.338 --> 28:27.044
Daddy promises to make sure
nothing bad

28:27.044 --> 28:28.981
ever happens to you.

28:28.981 --> 28:29.883
You see? There.

28:29.883 --> 28:33.089
Right there. That is
why I may have gone

28:33.089 --> 28:35.595
a little overboard with
your driving lessons.

28:35.595 --> 28:38.066
I made a promise to
you to protect you.

28:38.066 --> 28:40.203
(sighs)
You're my baby girl.

28:40.203 --> 28:43.009
I'm almost 17.

28:43.009 --> 28:45.882
I'm not your
baby girl anymore.

28:45.882 --> 28:47.384
And if you don't stop
treating me like it,

28:47.384 --> 28:49.422
I'm never gonna learn
how to function on my own.

28:49.422 --> 28:52.061
Yeah, well, driving
is a very big deal.

28:52.061 --> 28:53.631
And I got to make sure that

28:53.631 --> 28:55.635
you're ready, ready,
ready, ready.

28:55.635 --> 28:57.104
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

28:57.104 --> 28:59.075
Like you?
What do you mean?

29:01.479 --> 29:03.216
Look at this.

29:03.216 --> 29:04.853
You have one hand
on the wheel

29:04.853 --> 29:07.424
and is that a cell phone?

29:07.424 --> 29:08.861
Yeah.
No Bluetooth?

29:08.861 --> 29:10.063
You know that's illegal.

29:10.063 --> 29:11.466
Yeah, well, but
that's back then.

29:11.466 --> 29:13.571
I mean, we didn't even
use seat belts.

29:13.571 --> 29:15.307
And besides, your mother
was on the phone.

29:15.307 --> 29:17.912
The 18‐wheeler that just crashed
into your passenger side

29:17.912 --> 29:19.181
doesn't care who was calling.

29:19.181 --> 29:21.085
Bam!

29:21.085 --> 29:23.056
You're dead.

29:23.056 --> 29:25.093
(siren chirps)

29:27.097 --> 29:29.301
Wait a minute.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.940
Pause that tape.

29:31.940 --> 29:34.111
A baby blue convertible.

29:34.111 --> 29:37.351
This car was at the scene
of Ray Stoller's murder

29:37.351 --> 29:40.658
and Danny Mancini's
antique store 16 years later.

29:40.658 --> 29:42.361
It's not a coincidence.

29:42.361 --> 29:46.069
I bet whoever owns this car
framed Frankie.

29:46.069 --> 29:48.306
And‐and why aren't you
writing this down?

29:48.306 --> 29:50.545
These are
brand‐new notebooks.

29:50.545 --> 29:52.549
Because Frankie Kelso
confessed last night.

29:52.549 --> 29:54.653
Frankie confessed?

29:54.653 --> 29:56.523
You don't check your e‐mail?

29:56.523 --> 29:58.694
RIGGS: Rog.
I know, I know.

29:58.694 --> 30:00.698
Frankie confessed, but I still
don't think he did it.

30:00.698 --> 30:02.034
Yeah, no, listen...

30:02.034 --> 30:03.704
Why don't you ever
back me up?

30:03.704 --> 30:06.142
How many times
have I had your back?

30:06.142 --> 30:08.446
Like the time that you ripped up
a signed confession

30:08.446 --> 30:09.583
because you said the suspect

30:09.583 --> 30:12.054
"didn't have murder
in his eyes."
Okay, well, Rog...

30:12.054 --> 30:14.291
Or the time that
you said the guy didn't

30:14.291 --> 30:15.460
"smell like a killer."

30:15.460 --> 30:17.131
Okay, no killer
smells like lavender.

30:17.131 --> 30:20.137
Just once, Riggs, I need you
to have my back.

30:20.137 --> 30:21.205
Hey, Rog.
What?

30:21.205 --> 30:22.307
You're right.

30:25.313 --> 30:26.750
Watch this.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.086
Heads up, Frankie.

30:28.086 --> 30:31.125
Green tea?

30:31.125 --> 30:32.996
I'll be damned.
You're right.

30:32.996 --> 30:34.298
He did close his right eye.

30:34.298 --> 30:36.135
RIGGS:
Yep.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.373
I noticed him shooting lefty
at the antique store.

30:38.373 --> 30:40.076
Yeah, macular degeneration.

30:40.076 --> 30:42.314
Big black hole in the middle
of my right eye.

30:42.314 --> 30:43.517
Started a few years ago.

30:43.517 --> 30:44.351
It's not that interesting.

30:44.351 --> 30:47.457
You know, it's a
little interesting.

30:47.457 --> 30:48.727
Ah, see...

30:48.727 --> 30:50.197
that means you're
left‐eye dominant.

30:50.197 --> 30:51.399
Right?

30:51.399 --> 30:54.138
Now, see this little stain?

30:54.138 --> 30:57.679
That is from our shooter,
who's right‐eye dominant,

30:57.679 --> 31:00.317
sitting and waiting
for his target.

31:02.287 --> 31:04.191
It's not your weapon.

31:04.191 --> 31:06.730
MURTAUGH: So, if your
right eye is blind,

31:06.730 --> 31:09.703
how did you shoot Mike Diamond
with this weapon?

31:09.703 --> 31:12.775
I guess it was
just a lucky shot.

31:12.775 --> 31:15.380
Frankie, whoever set you up
didn't know about your eye.

31:15.380 --> 31:17.317
So who are you covering for?

31:17.317 --> 31:18.419
FRANKIE:
No one.

31:18.419 --> 31:22.795
You've been trying to put me
away for years, Ahab.

31:22.795 --> 31:24.031
Just take the win.

31:24.031 --> 31:27.371
I never read the book <i>Moby Dick,</i>
but I'm sure the whale

31:27.371 --> 31:29.275
didn't do time for a
crime he didn't commit.

31:29.275 --> 31:32.147
We're actually tracking
the car of the real killer.

31:32.147 --> 31:34.051
In the meantime,
you're free to go.

31:37.157 --> 31:38.794
So now what am I supposed to do?

31:38.794 --> 31:40.798
Just walk out of here?

31:40.798 --> 31:42.669
No consequences?

31:42.669 --> 31:45.073
RIGGS:
Ah, Frankie,

31:45.073 --> 31:46.843
as long as you don't
commit any felonies

31:46.843 --> 31:49.248
or take a leak in front of me
and my partner,

31:49.248 --> 31:51.085
we don't care what you do.

31:57.832 --> 32:00.805
I got a hit from the DMV
on that blue convertible.

32:00.805 --> 32:03.409
The last official sale was
in 2001 to Ray Stoller.

32:03.409 --> 32:04.546
Who died years ago.

32:04.546 --> 32:07.552
Which is why ownership passed on
to his son, Sam Stoller.

32:07.552 --> 32:10.658
He took over registration
in 2011 and six weeks ago,

32:10.658 --> 32:13.664
he was discharged from the Army,
Special Ops, sniper division.

32:13.664 --> 32:16.503
Okay, get that information to
the uni who's shadowing Frankie

32:16.503 --> 32:18.607
and find out
where Stoller is now.

32:22.715 --> 32:24.719
DISPATCHER:
Unit Five, possible suspect,

32:24.719 --> 32:25.855
Sam Stoller, identified.

32:25.855 --> 32:27.759
Six foot, red hair.

32:30.531 --> 32:33.469
Unit Five,
Detectives Murtaugh and Riggs

32:33.469 --> 32:35.473
are less than five minutes
from your position.

32:35.473 --> 32:39.081
Do not engage until backup
is on site.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.368
(siren wailing)

32:49.368 --> 32:50.905
Bailey says the uni's
not answering his walkie.

32:50.905 --> 32:52.508
Sounds like we're heading
into a situation.

32:52.508 --> 32:53.911
All right, so Ray Stoller's son
kills Diamond

32:53.911 --> 32:55.514
for ordering the hit
on his dad,

32:55.514 --> 32:56.783
and then frames
the actual hit man.

32:56.783 --> 32:58.654
Pretty slick.
Yeah, but why

32:58.654 --> 33:00.891
does Frankie confess?
I don't know.

33:00.891 --> 33:02.695
Maybe Frankie thinks he
deserves to be punished.

33:02.695 --> 33:05.734
Yeah. Coincidentally,
so does Sam Stoller.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.337

33:10.611 --> 33:11.746
(gun cocks)

33:16.590 --> 33:18.760

33:18.760 --> 33:20.731
I was just gonna go
make myself some tea.

33:20.731 --> 33:23.469
Want some? Sorry,
I got nothing stronger.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.774
My internist made me
give up drinking.

33:25.774 --> 33:28.379
You know who I am.

33:28.379 --> 33:29.849
I know why you're here, too.

33:32.522 --> 33:33.657
I'm okay with that.

33:33.657 --> 33:35.528
I got it coming.

33:35.528 --> 33:38.399
Just want you to know
it wasn't personal.

33:38.399 --> 33:39.501
It was just a job.

33:39.501 --> 33:41.272
You murdered my father.

33:41.272 --> 33:43.409
He stole a lot of money
from the wrong people.

33:43.409 --> 33:45.814
Not to make a better life
for you and your mom,

33:45.814 --> 33:46.950
only for him.

33:46.950 --> 33:49.254
To feed his appetites.

33:49.254 --> 33:51.358
Cocaine, gambling...

33:51.358 --> 33:53.597
(groans)

34:05.386 --> 34:06.523
He's bleeding.

34:08.527 --> 34:10.296
Wait, Rog, it's a trap!

34:10.296 --> 34:12.568
(gunshots)

34:14.906 --> 34:17.745
We got to get to him
before he bleeds out.

34:17.745 --> 34:19.214
(gunshots continue)

34:19.214 --> 34:22.253
Ready? Let's go.

34:50.878 --> 34:52.882
Frank, can you hear me?

34:53.884 --> 34:55.186
(gunshot)

34:57.625 --> 34:58.860
Hey, we got to get
him to a doctor.

34:58.860 --> 34:59.896
All right.

34:59.896 --> 35:01.633
Let's get you guys
in the car.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.704
Okay, wait. Well,
what about you?

35:03.704 --> 35:05.239
Somebody's got to get
this bird out of the perch.

35:05.239 --> 35:06.843
Yeah, but I can't leave
you by yourself.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.513
What are you talking about?
Who's gonna lay down cover fire
for you?

35:08.513 --> 35:09.582
We all go in the car.
Why are you doing this
right now?

35:09.582 --> 35:10.450
Oh, for crap sake!

35:10.450 --> 35:12.220
Tell him he's
the best cop you know.

35:12.220 --> 35:13.055
Tell him you love him.

35:13.055 --> 35:14.926
Enough with all this
sexual tension.

35:14.926 --> 35:16.462
Just come on,
come on, come on.

35:22.875 --> 35:24.612
Don't kill him.

35:24.612 --> 35:26.549

42:38.345 --> 42:41.785
I'd start with the warden
and pull every string available

42:41.785 --> 42:43.956
for pulling till
I got him out of here.

42:43.956 --> 42:45.960
(monitor beeping)
