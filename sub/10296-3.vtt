Not really.

02:02.067 --> 02:05.367
Aw, Peg, this was supposed

02:26.501 --> 02:28.100
He was listening
behind the door.

Al, we are not
leaving the children.

02:44.434 --> 02:45.667
Well what's wrong?

02:45.667 --> 02:47.067
There's someone
in our room.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.267
That's him!

02:49.267 --> 02:51.300
ALL: Aaah!

03:03.100 --> 03:04.133
Help!

03:04.133 --> 03:05.367
Help!

03:05.367 --> 03:06.767
Peg, do something.

03:06.767 --> 03:09.601
Aah!

we need a plan.

Here's what we do.

03:11.868 --> 03:13.467
We get in the car
and drive home.

03:13.467 --> 03:16.133
That's it, that's the plan.
Let's go!

03:19.467 --> 03:21.601
ALL:
Aaah!

03:23.601 --> 03:25.934
Who could have cut
our tires?

03:25.934 --> 03:27.200
Oh, well, let's see.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.834
Who do we know that's insane
and has a sharp object.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.767
Grandma?

03:32.767 --> 03:35.200
Dad, would this be
a bad time to remind you?

03:35.200 --> 03:36.734
We all voted for Hawaii.

03:36.734 --> 03:38.567
You know, Bud, there's still
an opening for someone

03:38.567 --> 03:41.133
to go upstairs
and get our bags.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.167
Uh, Dad?
Oh, what?!

03:43.167 --> 03:44.601
There's a phone
behind you.

03:44.601 --> 03:46.434
You might want to share
this with the police.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.234
I'm just tell them
that we're in this dump

03:48.234 --> 03:49.501
and if you have the time

03:49.501 --> 03:51.434
why don't you tell them
there's a killer upstairs!

03:53.267 --> 03:55.701
See?
There's a team player.

Hello!

04:01.601 --> 04:03.234
The phone's dead.

04:03.234 --> 04:05.067
Okay, I know how
to buy us some time.

04:05.067 --> 04:08.601
We'll tie Kelly up,
and leave her as an offering.

04:08.601 --> 04:11.601
Uh-uh.
Last born, first torn.

04:11.601 --> 04:13.467
Don't move.

04:16.166 --> 04:17.166
I love you, Al.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.666
Who cares?
We're going to die.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.801
What are you folks doing?

04:25.801 --> 04:29.534
Wetting ourselves.

04:29.534 --> 04:31.534
Someone tried to kill us
in our room.

04:31.534 --> 04:34.000
Oh, yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.934
Must've been the guy
who does that every five years.

04:36.934 --> 04:39.834
That wasn't
in the brochure, Al.

04:39.834 --> 04:41.834
The storm washed
the bridge out.

04:41.834 --> 04:44.467
That means the killer
is stuck right here with us.

04:44.467 --> 04:47.300
Got him right
where I want him.

04:47.300 --> 04:50.334
Well, might as well
go back to bed now.

04:50.334 --> 04:52.701
Oh, if you folks see
him again, just holler.

04:52.701 --> 04:54.634
I'll try and find you.

04:56.234 --> 05:00.534
There goes the only  man in town
who can save us from the killer.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.567
We're dead.

05:02.567 --> 05:05.667
Well, maybe this is just one
of those mystery weekends.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.367
There's no mystery, Mom.

05:07.367 --> 05:09.501
Dad was just too cheap
to take us someplace nice,

05:09.501 --> 05:10.834
and we're going
to be butchered.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.300
Thank your father, kids.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.968
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.

05:15.968 --> 05:17.934
Okay,
family meeting.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.767
All right, now, let's discuss
what we know already.

05:23.767 --> 05:26.133
We're trapped by a killer,
the phones are dead,

05:26.133 --> 05:29.334
and the sheriff couldn't
catch an M&M in his mouth.

05:29.334 --> 05:32.067
So it looks like it's left
up to us to survive.

05:32.067 --> 05:34.901
Now, what we need is a weapon.
Any weapons?

05:34.901 --> 05:37.901
How about Bud's underwear
on a stick?

05:40.033 --> 05:42.434
That's a good thought, Kelly,
but we can't get to our clothes.

05:42.434 --> 05:44.100
Well, here's
a plastic fork, Al.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.467
That's good enough.

05:45.467 --> 05:48.200
Now, here's what
we're gonna do.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.200
We're gonna sit
with our backs to each other

05:50.200 --> 05:52.133
so no one
can sneak up on us.

05:52.133 --> 05:54.400
Now, we'll set up a watch.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.100
We'll take turns,
I'll take the first watch.

05:56.100 --> 05:59.567
Now, I think I can stay up all
night, but if I get sleepy,

05:59.567 --> 06:00.734
I'll wake you up.

06:00.734 --> 06:02.501
Now, be careful, Al.

06:02.501 --> 06:04.968
Don't worry about me.
I got the fork.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.834
Well, this is certainly
a fine how-do-you-do.

06:20.834 --> 06:22.834
They're alive.

06:22.834 --> 06:24.367
What happens to our pool?

06:24.367 --> 06:27.834
I guess we just roll it
over till tonight.

06:27.834 --> 06:29.067
CROWD: Yeah.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.901
Think we should
we wake them up?

06:30.901 --> 06:32.100
It's almost noon.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.300
Don't startle the poor
little white-haired girl.

06:35.300 --> 06:39.100
I read them albinos
are real skittish.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.267
Be careful.

06:41.267 --> 06:45.167
The one with the powerful feet
got a fork in his pants.

06:47.434 --> 06:48.601
Hey, Bundy, get up.

06:52.334 --> 06:54.801
Peg, kids, get up.

06:54.801 --> 06:55.801
It's safe.

06:55.801 --> 06:57.200
Thanks to me.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.133
Al, why didn't you wake us
for our watch?

07:00.133 --> 07:03.968
Hey, the lion
watches over his cubs.

07:03.968 --> 07:06.267
Oh, the sheriff said to tell you

07:06.267 --> 07:08.234
he didn't find
nothing in your room.

07:08.234 --> 07:10.701
It's safe to go back up.

07:10.701 --> 07:12.434
Uh, excuse me, everybody.

07:12.434 --> 07:14.167
I don't mean
to interrupt your meal.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.033
But I would just
like to say thanks

07:16.033 --> 07:18.701
for rushing to our aid as
I was screaming into the night.

07:18.701 --> 07:19.701
Does everybody
realize that

07:19.701 --> 07:21.501
we were almost
killed last night?

07:21.501 --> 07:24.167
Yeah, sure do.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.033
Oh, well, then maybe
I'm boring you.

07:27.033 --> 07:28.934
Isn't anybody else scared?

07:28.934 --> 07:30.334
No...

07:30.334 --> 07:33.434
You see, there is this axe
wielding maniac on the loose.

07:33.434 --> 07:36.634
Sometimes they
can hurt you.

07:36.634 --> 07:40.167
Won't hurt us.
He just kills tourists.

We're out of here.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.601
Al, may I remind you
that somebody

07:50.601 --> 07:53.100
has slashed our tires,
the bridge is washed out,

07:53.100 --> 07:58.801
and somewhere in Honolulu,
there's a family going, "Ahh."

07:58.801 --> 08:01.234
You can't let it alone,
can you Peg?

08:01.234 --> 08:03.467
Now this is nice.
"Why can't we go to Hawaii?"

08:03.467 --> 08:04.901
"Why did we have to come here?"

08:04.901 --> 08:07.033
"Why do we have
to take this car?"

08:07.033 --> 08:08.801
You know, standing here
with my loving family,

08:08.801 --> 08:09.868
I have a question.

08:09.868 --> 08:12.267
Why am I running
from the axe?

08:15.634 --> 08:17.267
You're right, Al.

08:17.267 --> 08:19.434
I'm sorry to keep
harping at you.

08:19.434 --> 08:22.200
I mean, sure there's
a maniac stalking us,

08:22.200 --> 08:23.767
but what about
all these nice people

08:23.767 --> 08:26.667
and the raw beauty
that is Poppy's?

I feel so low.

here, Al.

is inside waiting for us?

to be the brave one.
