this Mick Jagger-looking guy

00:51.986 --> 00:53.085
is even gonna try--

So this cold-blooded killer
is gonna help us?

02:11.132 --> 02:13.265
He's not a killer.
He's protecting us.

02:13.267 --> 02:16.268

It's sort of our thing.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.237

You guys have a thing?

02:18.239 --> 02:20.239
He means
a Shadowhunter thing.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.508
That's what they do,
protecting humans
from demons.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.843
Demons, right.
That makes perfect sense,

02:24.845 --> 02:26.478
'cause there are demons
running all around New York.

Our wards will deter them.
[officer] <i> Police.</i>

will do their typical

followed him to get to Clary.

A Circle rune,
just like the guys
that took my mother.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.037
What exactly is
a Circle member

02:52.039 --> 02:53.839
and why are they
trying to kill us?

02:53.841 --> 02:57.342
All we know is...
a long time ago
the Circle led a revolt.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.178
A lot of Shadowhunters
got killed...

02:59.880 --> 03:01.213
including my father.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.015
[Alec] And since the revolt
we've been forbidden

03:03.017 --> 03:05.184
to even hear
about the Circle.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.653
But, how is that
even possible?
It's your history.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.556

she was a Shadowhunter?

03:10.558 --> 03:12.324
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

And now the only person
who knows
the truth is missing,

03:14.395 --> 03:17.796
so I don't care
about your rules
or what's forbidden, I'm...

03:17.798 --> 03:19.698
There's got to be
someone out there
who can tell us

03:19.700 --> 03:22.134
why they've taken
my mother.
[Jace] There is.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.369

So, uh, bring on the runes.

03:43.157 --> 03:45.224
[scoffs]
What exactly are runes?

03:45.226 --> 03:48.060
They give Shadowhunters
our demon-fighting powers.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.997
So hot.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.032
[clears throat]
The rune. [clears throat]

03:54.034 --> 03:56.868

Don't worry, Clary.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.238
I'll watch over
the best friend.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.872
In fact, I was about
to make breakfast.

04:00.874 --> 04:04.543
[inhales] On second thought,
the runes might
be less lethal.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.112
[sighs] I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

04:07.114 --> 04:10.015
Please excuse my brother's
lack of manners.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.252
This is Alec...
and I'm Isabelle.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.954
Lewis. Simon, Simon Lewis.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.389
Two first names.
Am I still talking?

04:17.391 --> 04:18.890

04:24.365 --> 04:25.631

Where are we going?

04:30.704 --> 04:32.037
Hey, uh...

04:32.039 --> 04:34.206
don't eat the food.
Dangerous.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.341
[Clary] Jace, coming?
[Jace] Yeah, I'm coming.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.631
Where's Magnus Bane?

05:01.902 --> 05:03.302
Keep moving, warlock.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.237
[woman grunts and pants]

05:05.239 --> 05:07.472
Now, what were you gonna
do with that warlock?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.574
Is that part of
Valentine's plan now, huh?

05:09.576 --> 05:11.276
Humans, now warlocks?

05:11.278 --> 05:13.145
You're nothing
but a traitor. [chuckles]

05:13.147 --> 05:14.980
A disgrace to the Circle.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.649
[grunting]

05:17.651 --> 05:19.818
The only disgrace
is that there's
a Circle at all.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.153
[panting]

05:21.155 --> 05:22.788
But I hear that your
membership is dwindling.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.190
You killed Konrad.
I know it.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.758
I didn't have
the pleasure.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.761
You can blame your allegiance
to Valentine for that.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.763
Now, let's make a deal.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.433
You're gonna
tell me some secrets
and I'll make sure

05:34.435 --> 05:38.003
that you don't end up
in the morgue like
your boyfriend, Konrad.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.022
[indistinct chatter]

05:57.858 --> 05:59.491
Who is that guy?

05:59.493 --> 06:01.560
[Jace] That's
Hodge Starkweather,
our weapons trainer.

06:01.562 --> 06:05.364
And, more important for us,
a former Circle member.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.299
After the uprising,
Hodge repented

06:07.301 --> 06:09.368
and he was sent to
live and work here
to make amends.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.137
But he's forbidden to ever
leave the Institute.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.805
[grunting]

06:13.807 --> 06:14.873

06:14.875 --> 06:16.541
[Hodge grunts]
[gasps]

06:26.920 --> 06:27.986
Jocelyn.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.488
Uh, I'm Clary.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.324
Uh, Jocelyn Fray
is my mother.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.893
Well, she was
Jocelyn Fairchild
when I knew her.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.895
[exhales]

06:36.897 --> 06:38.563
And she was one
of my best friends.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.266
She's been kidnapped...

06:41.268 --> 06:42.834
by someone named
Valentine and his men.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.736
By the Circle, Hodge.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.005
But that's impossible.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.341
Valentine's dead
and the Circle
died with him.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.510
[chokes]
[Clary] What's happening?

06:53.380 --> 06:56.415
I swore a vow
never to speak of
what we did.

06:56.417 --> 06:59.684
This is the Clave's way
of making sure
I keep that vow.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.353
We can't torture him, Jace.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.188
Is there anyone
else we can ask?

07:03.190 --> 07:04.856
[Hodge] If the Circle
really is back...

07:05.759 --> 07:07.259
and they've taken Jocelyn...

07:08.228 --> 07:09.561
Our leader...
our leader of the Circle

07:09.563 --> 07:11.797
was Valentine
Morgenstern-- [winces]

07:11.799 --> 07:13.432
[rune searing]
[stammers]

07:14.735 --> 07:18.470
We thought he wanted
to protect humans,
like all Shadowhunters.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.939
But we never
realized the lengths

07:20.941 --> 07:23.208
which Valentine
was willing to go...

07:23.210 --> 07:25.544
the people he was
willing to sacrifice.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.379
[rune searing]
[inhales sharply]

07:27.381 --> 07:30.415
Most of humanity would die
if we carried out
Valentine's plan.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.218
But I... I still
don't understand.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.754
How does my mother
relate to any of this?

07:35.756 --> 07:38.623
[sighs] Jocelyn was
a member of
the Circle as well.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.638
No.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.074
[stutters]
I can't believe it.
My mother, she--

07:56.076 --> 07:58.677
The important thing
is that Jocelyn
left the Circle.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.112
And so none of
this even matters,

08:01.114 --> 08:04.282
because Valentine died
in a fire years ago.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.085
[groaning]
Hodge. Hodge.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.955
I'm sorry,
but we can't ask
you to do this.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.591
Clary, we don't
have a choice.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.259
[sighs] You understand that,
Hodge, right?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.495
[panting] Jace...

08:17.498 --> 08:19.264
is right.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.032
Valentine nearly destroyed
the Shadow World

08:21.034 --> 08:23.001
and humanity
along with it.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.102
If he'd gotten the Cup--

08:24.104 --> 08:25.670
Wait a minute.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.606
My mother told me
she hid something
from someone.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.107
If it's this Cup--

08:29.109 --> 08:33.178
Clary, the Mortal Cup
is the most important object
in the Shadow World.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.114
Whoever possesses it can
create more Shadowhunters.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.116
And in the wrong hands...

08:38.118 --> 08:39.951
control demons.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.219
[gasps]

08:41.221 --> 08:42.654
[Hodge] If Jocelyn
hid the Cup from Valentine,

08:42.656 --> 08:45.724
then she's in more danger
than you can possibly imagine.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.791
[rune searing]
[screams]

08:46.793 --> 08:48.660
[Jace] Hodge.
[Hodge yelps]

08:48.662 --> 08:51.963
[breathing heavily]
I hate to make you
suffer like this.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.366
[panting]

08:56.870 --> 08:59.037
I'm so sorry.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.473
Your mother was only
trying to protect you.

09:01.475 --> 09:04.242
And now you must
protect her.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.412
Stop Valentine...

09:07.414 --> 09:09.548
before he destroys us all.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.149
[breath trembling]

09:15.656 --> 09:16.821
Clary, but...

09:16.823 --> 09:18.823
Clary, look, will you
just calm down?
Calm down?

09:18.825 --> 09:20.859
Really, calm down?

09:20.860 --> 09:22.894
Okay, Jace, you might be
some kind of emotionless
G.I. Joe, but--

09:22.896 --> 09:24.262
What is a G.I. Joe?

09:24.264 --> 09:27.699
A soldier who
doesn't understand
human emotions,

09:27.701 --> 09:30.001
who doesn't know
what it's like
to lose someone,

09:30.003 --> 09:31.102
to lose your own mother.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.939
You're right.
I never knew my mother.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.441
[stammers] I didn't know.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.676
That's precisely
my point.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.344
You don't know
anything about this.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.679
You don't know about me,
you don't know
about my life...

09:40.681 --> 09:42.581
[sighs]
...but in the Shadow World,

09:42.583 --> 09:45.750
no training and no plan
gets you killed.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.520
[Clary sighs]

09:48.522 --> 09:51.756
Okay, so we know
that Valentine is back
and wants the Cup,

09:51.758 --> 09:54.025
and for some reason
he thinks my mother has it.

09:54.761 --> 09:55.827
Could she?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.330
Have the Cup?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.231
I don't know.

10:00.233 --> 10:03.134
Look, Clary,
you know about runes.
You've drawn them.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.869
You... you know something.
Think, please.

10:04.871 --> 10:08.940
I've tried, Jace, okay?
It's just this
empty blackness.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.142
[sighs]

10:11.144 --> 10:12.877
Your memory's been wiped.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.446
That's not possible.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.916
Is it?
Absolutely...

10:17.918 --> 10:19.050
if you know a warlock.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.118
A warlock?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.386
Yeah, a warlock,
Clary.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.655
Immortal beings,
they're half-demon,
half-human.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.624
Sometimes
their fingers spark.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.759
Dot, my mom's assistant,

10:27.761 --> 10:30.228
her hands had this purple glow
when she opened the wall

10:30.230 --> 10:33.231
and my mom pushed me through
and I ended up at
the police station.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.666
That was a Portal.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.636
Dot must have been a warlock.
Only warlocks can create them.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.838
Wait, so you're saying
if we find the real Dot,

10:39.840 --> 10:42.540
she could help us find the Cup
and get my mom back?

10:43.510 --> 10:45.076
Unless she's working
for Valentine.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.012
Even better.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.747
She'll lead us
right to him.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.483
Where's Simon?

11:14.875 --> 11:16.608
[door opens]

11:16.610 --> 11:18.076
[sighs]

11:19.446 --> 11:22.180
Where's Clary?
What happened to her?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.049
We sent her through
a Portal to you.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.951
You sent her
through a Portal? Alone?

11:26.953 --> 11:28.019
She could be in limbo.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.888
Well, I didn't have
much of a choice.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.357
I stayed to help Jocelyn
fight Valentine's men

11:32.359 --> 11:34.893
and I got thrown through
a plate glass window.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.127
Who do you think
glamoured the house

11:36.129 --> 11:37.896
so that the mundane police
wouldn't be alerted?

11:37.898 --> 11:40.832
Where's Clary?
And where's Jocelyn?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.801
I don't know.

11:42.803 --> 11:46.738
All I know is
that I sent Clary
to the police station.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.039
To you.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.410
And what exactly
are you doing
with all that stuff?

11:52.412 --> 11:54.512
[Luke] I can't have
anybody tracking Clary.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.880
Including you.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.315
What's that
supposed to mean?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.050
It means that this
stuff is going back

11:59.052 --> 12:00.685
to the station with me,
where it's safe.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.053
[exhales sharply]

12:02.689 --> 12:04.989
Where are you going?

12:04.991 --> 12:08.326
To find Clary.
They'll come for her next.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.528
If anyone can help,
it's Magnus Bane.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.163
Dot.
[softly] What?

12:12.165 --> 12:13.998
You can't trust anybody.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.567
You're absolutely right.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.352
[giggles]

12:34.354 --> 12:38.423
So, um... what happens
to humans if they're...

12:39.359 --> 12:40.425
runed?

12:41.595 --> 12:42.727
They usually die.

12:42.729 --> 12:45.230
Sometimes they go crazy.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.699
When that happens,
we call them the Forsaken.

12:48.735 --> 12:51.102
Then we kill them.
Right.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.404
So the rune
on Clary's neck...

12:53.406 --> 12:54.305
A healing rune.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.107
Jace used it
to save her life.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.543
So Jace knew she
was a Shadowhunter?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.111
He was almost certain.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.049
Where could you
possibly be going?

13:05.051 --> 13:06.484
To get Clary,
to protect her from Jace.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.987
And why would she need
protection from Jace?

13:08.989 --> 13:10.588
He's the ultimate
protector.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.223
What makes Jace so special?

13:12.225 --> 13:14.559
Fastest, strongest,
fiercest.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.060
[chuckles]

13:16.062 --> 13:18.263
And hello,
have you seen the guy?

13:18.265 --> 13:21.733
Yeah, well, uh...
sorry I asked.

13:21.735 --> 13:23.902
Rest easy, <i> hombre.</i>

13:23.904 --> 13:25.670
Clary's in good hands.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.309
Mmm, don't worry.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.579
There's plenty more
where that came from.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.948
Good to know. [chuckles]

13:36.950 --> 13:38.416
Good to know.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.753
So the Circle...

13:41.755 --> 13:45.323
if they're as bad as they
say they are, it's not
good for Clary, is it?

13:48.128 --> 13:49.694
It's not good for any of us.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.335
[Jace] Where are you,
Jocelyn Fray?

13:58.872 --> 14:00.371
[beeping]

14:24.531 --> 14:26.631
[Vargas] Luke.
Hey.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.732
What's the story?

14:27.734 --> 14:29.467
Uh, the story...

14:29.469 --> 14:30.969
Uh...
With Clary.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.737
How's she doing?
Oh, you talked to Clary?

14:32.739 --> 14:34.472
When she stopped by.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.974
Oh, she was here?

14:35.976 --> 14:37.642
When?
I don't know.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.844
The other day, when
you were interviewing
those two witnesses.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.312
[stutters] Oh, yeah.
You know what?

14:41.314 --> 14:44.082
I had so much going on,
I had Alaric take her home.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.317
But Clary's okay, right?

14:46.319 --> 14:47.318
Yeah.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.653
She said she was
upset about a boy,

14:48.655 --> 14:50.922
but my instincts tell me
there's more to the story.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.257
[scoffs] I wouldn't
worry about that.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.725
You know guys that age,
they're idiots.

14:53.727 --> 14:54.926
Just that age?

14:54.928 --> 14:56.694
[chuckles]

14:56.696 --> 14:59.063
Well, some of us
transform ourselves
and hide the idiot within.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.832
Well, if I ever
had a daughter...

15:00.834 --> 15:03.167
I'd be running
a background check
on every boy in sight.

15:03.169 --> 15:07.005
Ah, that's some sound
police work, Captain.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.674
This is the least
revealing thing you have?

15:09.676 --> 15:11.509
[chuckles] What?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.912
All the naughty
bits are covered.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.713
A little too much
in my opinion.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.515
[sighs]

15:17.517 --> 15:19.617
Where's Simon?
Who?

15:19.619 --> 15:23.421
[chuckles] Kidding.
He's in good hands
with the boys.

15:24.858 --> 15:26.925
So, um...

15:26.927 --> 15:30.461
you, Alec, and Jace are...
what, like, family?

15:30.463 --> 15:34.265
[chuckles] Translation,
you want to know
if Jace and I are a thing.

15:34.868 --> 15:36.100
[scoffs] Why would I care?

15:36.102 --> 15:37.602
Because you do.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.038
Don't worry.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.474
In every way,
he's like my brother.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.376
Our parents took
Jace in when he was ten.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.646
We trained together.
Learned to fight
side by side.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.616
[sighs] A few days ago,
all I had to worry about

15:51.618 --> 15:52.951
was getting into art school.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.786
[inhales] And now...

15:54.788 --> 15:56.587
Is this the part

15:56.589 --> 15:58.656
where I give you the pep talk
about harnessing
your inner Shadowhunter

15:58.658 --> 16:00.124
and accepting
your true destiny?

16:00.126 --> 16:01.592
Was that the pep talk?

16:01.594 --> 16:03.294
[chuckles] Basically.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.997
Clary... [sighs]

16:08.668 --> 16:11.436
Remember, you were
born to do this.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.472
No matter
what has happened...

16:14.474 --> 16:16.374
this is who you are.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.643
Not exactly feeling that.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.978
Yet.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.081
Okay, but now we
just have to find Dot.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.482
[sighs]
And track down and kill

16:24.484 --> 16:26.451
the most dangerous rogue
Shadowhunter in history

16:26.453 --> 16:28.686
before he kills us all.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.856
You really know
how to ruin a pep talk,
don't you?

16:31.858 --> 16:33.958
Come on, let's go.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.462
Oh, and Simon is
kind of nerd-hot.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.997
[chuckles]

16:40.300 --> 16:41.499
[sighs]

16:43.336 --> 16:44.969
[Luke] Hey. Clary was here
and we missed her.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.304
When?
The other day.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.506
I think she saw me talking
to the Circle members.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.374
What do we do now?

16:49.376 --> 16:50.942
I got a lead
I'm gonna check out.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.277
You work the
Simon Lewis angle.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.780
Where Clary goes,
Simon's bound to follow.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.549
Let's get out of here,
just you and me.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.018
We can get Dot ourselves.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.619
Simon, there are
demons out there, okay?

17:01.621 --> 17:04.322
Actual demons with tentacles
that wanna murder us.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.190
Do you know how
to kill a demon?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.359
I'm an Internet search away.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.461
Simon, I really don't
think it's that simple.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.063
[Simon] I bet you
it's not that hard.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.569
Whoa.
No, Izzy.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.872
Fifty bucks says
he doesn't
approve this mission.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.640
I don't approve
of this mission.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.008
I spoke with the Clave.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.676
They're sending Seelie scouts
to search for Valentine,

17:25.678 --> 17:26.878
but they made it clear,

17:26.880 --> 17:28.146
the little girl
does not leave
the premises.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.081
Hey, my name is not
"little girl", okay?

17:30.083 --> 17:32.183
I don't care what
that Clave thing
or you want,

17:32.185 --> 17:33.584
I'm going to find Dot.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.254
Alec, this warlock could
have the answers we need.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.089
With Valentine's
people out there
searching for Clary,

17:38.091 --> 17:40.324
she's not safe outside alone.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.826
Jace has a point.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.062
<i> Et tu,</i> Izzy?

17:44.064 --> 17:45.763
All right, since you
have all the answers,

17:45.765 --> 17:47.165
where do you
suggest we search?

17:47.167 --> 17:49.567
We should start
at Dot's apartment
in Greenpoint,

17:49.569 --> 17:51.769
and there's this
thrift store that she...
[gasps]

17:51.771 --> 17:53.271
[panting]

17:56.943 --> 17:58.109
What's wrong?
What is it?

17:58.111 --> 18:00.912
I, um... [exhales]

18:00.914 --> 18:02.880
Weirdly, I think
I know where Dot is.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.049
Great. I'll drive.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.351
What?

18:07.353 --> 18:09.654
Unless you have, like,
a Shadowhunter-mobile
or something.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.656
[chuckles]

18:14.394 --> 18:15.893
You were kidding
about the runes

18:15.895 --> 18:18.196
on the floor killing me...
right?

18:21.367 --> 18:22.433
Possibly.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.472
Wait... am I gonna die?

18:27.474 --> 18:31.109
[Magnus] Hurry up, warlocks.
Last train to salvation.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.580
Magnus! Hey.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.882
Why haven't you
answered my messages?

18:37.884 --> 18:39.550
Jocelyn's missing and I--

18:39.552 --> 18:42.720
I've been a little busy
protecting our people
from certain death.

18:42.722 --> 18:43.921
What are you
talking about?

18:43.923 --> 18:46.724
Jocelyn's brilliant
plan is screwed.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.726
Valentine knows
a warlock brewed

18:48.728 --> 18:49.994
the potion that
put her to sleep.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.997
He's hunting
warlocks down
one by one.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.265
What, so you're leaving?

18:54.267 --> 18:56.567
You've always been
the quick study, Dorothy.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.904
It's our only choice
until we know what
Valentine is up to.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.772
Let's go.
No, I... I can't.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.742
I've been Portaling
all over the city
looking for Clary

19:04.744 --> 19:07.678
and my magic is
dangerously low.
I need your help.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.515
Are you really
going to risk your life
for a Shadowhunter?

19:10.517 --> 19:13.518
[stammers] This isn't
us versus them, Magnus.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.686
If Valentine gets the Cup,
we're all doomed.

19:15.688 --> 19:18.189
Valentine can't kill
what he can't find.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.092
Last chance to save yourself.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.165
[sighs]

19:37.644 --> 19:39.210
[indistinct conversations]

19:44.951 --> 19:46.517
[siren wailing in distance]

19:52.025 --> 19:53.391
[screams]

19:53.393 --> 19:55.026
[grunting]

19:59.299 --> 20:00.698
[grunting]

20:12.412 --> 20:13.544
[gasps]

20:13.546 --> 20:15.079
[Dot] No!

20:15.481 --> 20:16.647
Dot.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.982
Dot!

20:29.195 --> 20:30.394
[Jace] Clary!

20:30.396 --> 20:32.663
Clary, stop!
Where are you going?

20:32.665 --> 20:34.432
Two men,
Circle members...

20:34.434 --> 20:36.701
the same ones who
came to my house,
who took my mom.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.336
They have Dot.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.938
They're gonna
hurt her or kill her.
We have to stop them!

20:53.753 --> 20:55.686
[breath trembling] No.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.090
She was just
trying to help me.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.561
Now, she's gone.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.363
Clary, I'm sorry.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.465
You don't understand.
Dot's like my big sister.

21:07.467 --> 21:08.699
It's not safe here.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.135
We have to go back
to the Institute right now.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.104
So, what now?
Valentine has
my mom and Dot,

21:13.106 --> 21:15.539
and we're just
gonna give up?

21:15.541 --> 21:18.042
What about my memories?
They can't just be gone?

21:18.544 --> 21:19.610
There is another option.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.245
Don't even--
Absolutely not.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.414
I'm not afraid of
the Silent Brothers.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.782
Who are the Silent Brothers?

21:24.784 --> 21:26.817
They're Shadowhunters
with superior powers.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.786
Who possess the ability
to recover memories.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.722
A process that
can also kill you,
so there's that.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.058
Your bedside manner
is abysmal.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.960
We've broken at least
18 Clave rules

21:35.962 --> 21:37.762
and now you want to go
to the City of Bones?

21:37.764 --> 21:39.964
There's no way.
I won't allow it.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.799
This isn't our choice to make.

21:42.568 --> 21:43.901
This is Clary's decision.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.803
[Isabelle] You can't
ask her to do this.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.406
She doesn't know
what she's facing.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.907
She's not prepared.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.410
If anyone can
tell me another way
to recover my memories

21:52.412 --> 21:53.644
and still get
the answers we need,

21:53.646 --> 21:55.146
I'm listening.

22:03.523 --> 22:04.689
That settles it.

22:04.691 --> 22:07.925
See? I told you
she's one of us.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.284
[Simon] Yeah,
this place isn't creepy.

22:33.286 --> 22:34.652
Not at all.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.354
[chuckles] Don't
tell me you're afraid.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.522
[scoffs]
Are you kidding me?
I was born afraid...

22:38.524 --> 22:40.324
which sounded a lot
better in my head.

22:40.326 --> 22:42.393
[Isabelle chuckles]
[Alec] Let's check it out.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.398
[Jace] Wait here a minute.
I wanna see if it's safe.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.135
Why are we doing this?

22:51.971 --> 22:53.637
We don't even
know these people.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.206
Hey.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.209
If something goes wrong...

22:58.211 --> 23:00.644
if something happens
to her, that's on us.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.546
You know that, don't you?
Yeah.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.349
And you know exactly
what'd happen if Valentine
gets the Cup before we do.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.652
She's lost
everything, Alec.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.288
I know exactly
what that feels like.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.092
And what's your problem
with her, anyway?

23:15.094 --> 23:17.161
Your family always
used to welcome strays.

23:17.163 --> 23:19.063
You were never a stray.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.600
The point is,
nothing's changed.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.969
We're in this fight together.
There's just...

23:25.671 --> 23:26.904
one more of us.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.573
[sighs] I just wish
my mom had trusted me

23:29.575 --> 23:31.142
enough to tell me
about all this.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.512
What is it?
What's wrong?

23:34.514 --> 23:37.515
How are you not
ultra freaked out
by all of this?

23:37.517 --> 23:40.351
I guess I just always
felt like there was
something missing.

23:41.354 --> 23:43.287
Some void I couldn't
quite explain.

23:44.690 --> 23:47.892
Things are finally
starting to make sense.

23:47.894 --> 23:50.928
But none of it's gonna matter
unless I get my mom back.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.265
Then let's do that.

23:55.802 --> 23:56.734
Clary.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.103
Come on, it's all clear.
Let's go.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.835
[sighs]

24:30.837 --> 24:34.305
I'd hoped my men could have
persuaded you to help us.

24:34.307 --> 24:38.676
For someone so old,
you're not too wise,
are you?

24:39.245 --> 24:42.313
See, it's very simple.

24:42.315 --> 24:46.417
Reverse Jocelyn's spell
and you'll be
free to live your...

24:47.253 --> 24:49.920
wasteful, warlock life.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.590
[scoffs] You're a liar.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.091
[chuckles]

24:54.093 --> 24:56.660
You'd never let me go.

24:56.662 --> 24:57.862
[clears throat]

24:57.864 --> 25:00.598
But I swear,
it wasn't me.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.266
I can't break the spell.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.402
Who did it then?

25:07.607 --> 25:09.006
[inhales sharply]

25:12.512 --> 25:14.945
I want the warlock's name.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.682
See, Jocelyn
may be unreachable,

25:18.684 --> 25:21.218
but her daughter
is still out there.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.888
You must want to
help the girl, right?

25:27.193 --> 25:28.526
[inhales deeply]

25:28.528 --> 25:31.996
Maybe a little medicine...

25:31.998 --> 25:34.365
will trigger
your memory, hmm?

25:35.001 --> 25:36.133
[screams]

25:36.135 --> 25:37.635
[groans] No.

25:39.472 --> 25:40.804
[sobbing]
Shh.

25:46.312 --> 25:49.013
[Jace] You have to understand,
the Silent Brothers
aren't like us.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.849
They lack your charm and
superior people skills?

25:51.851 --> 25:54.418
Yeah, most people do.

25:54.420 --> 25:58.722
Brothers communicate
without using words,
using just their thoughts.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.558
That doesn't
sound so bad.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.860
Don't let their
silence fool you.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.995
They'll hold
the Soul-Sword
to your head,

26:04.997 --> 26:08.732
and with its blade,
carve the truth
from your mind.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.702
If you're not strong enough,
you will die.

26:11.704 --> 26:14.171
I take it back.
That sounds
level ten bad.

26:14.173 --> 26:15.673
Clary, you should know,

26:15.675 --> 26:17.508
the pain will be excruciating.
You don't have to--

26:17.510 --> 26:19.376
I'll do anything.

26:19.378 --> 26:23.013
Walk through fire,
battle demons,
whatever it takes.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.416
I have to get
my mom back.

26:25.418 --> 26:28.252
I can't...
I won't lose her.

26:28.688 --> 26:29.987
You won't.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.022
We won't.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.269
[sighs] I can do this.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.537
[Simon] Yeah, you can.

26:46.539 --> 26:49.006
You're Clary freakin' Fray.
You can do anything.

26:51.377 --> 26:52.776
All right, hold up.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.545
Surprise, surprise.

26:54.547 --> 26:57.047
No mundanes allowed,
just like in the training
room, right? Wrong!

26:57.049 --> 26:59.717
I've seen every
horror movie ever made
and the funny best friend

26:59.719 --> 27:01.452
who gets left behind...

27:01.454 --> 27:02.553
dead man.

27:02.555 --> 27:04.788
[laughing]
You're not that funny.

27:05.558 --> 27:07.191
But by all means,
go ahead.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.962
Of course,
the minute you enter,
you'll die.

27:12.898 --> 27:14.932
Problem is,
now I don't trust you.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.066
He's not lying.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.234
Now.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.335
He was before.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.070
[Alec] The rune energy
in the City of Bones will kill

27:20.072 --> 27:23.073
any mundane who
dares to enter,
so, please...

27:23.075 --> 27:25.743
[Isabelle sighs]
The Brothers creep me out.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.245
I'll mind the mundane.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.413
Your sacrifice
is noted, Izzy.

27:29.415 --> 27:30.514
[Simon] Talk about sacrifice.

27:30.516 --> 27:32.650
I'm missing
a financial analysis class.

27:32.652 --> 27:37.054
I can't be here anymore,
so, Jace, I'm gonna
mind the perimeter.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.289
I don't wanna leave you.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.493
Go be a badass
Shadowhunter, all right?

27:42.495 --> 27:44.261
Get your memories back,
save your mother.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.929
I'll be right here...

27:45.931 --> 27:47.998
guarding the entrance
to hell.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.203
Clary, you don't keep
the Silent Brothers waiting.

27:54.507 --> 27:55.906
You got this.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.313
They're getting to
be quite the team.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.215
Amusing.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.017
No, not really.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.253
[indistinct chatter
on police radio]

28:17.129 --> 28:19.229
Got this from
the shift commander.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.633
One of your witnesses
turned up dead outside
an abandoned church.

28:22.635 --> 28:24.101
Then there's this.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.303
[Luke groans]
Your other witness

28:26.305 --> 28:28.205
winds up dead
inside a parking garage.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.808
Look, I don't know what
tore into this woman,

28:30.810 --> 28:33.644
and I really don't know
what happened to that car.

28:33.646 --> 28:34.845
Looks like
the demonic murder crew's

28:34.847 --> 28:36.413
taking out their
witnesses one by one.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.482
You sure that's all it is?

28:38.484 --> 28:41.418
Oh, come on, Captain.
You've got no
reason to doubt me.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.221
Don't give me one.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.497
You're supposed to
stay under the radar.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.065
It was self-defense.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.401
You know I'm on
the right side of things.
I know that.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.837
I'm not sure
our friends agree.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.338
If you wanna
smooth things over,

29:01.340 --> 29:03.273
I suggest you
find Clary soon...

29:03.275 --> 29:05.075
or they will.

29:05.511 --> 29:06.677
I will.

29:06.679 --> 29:08.345
No one knows her
better than I do.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.260
[bats chittering]

29:29.068 --> 29:30.134
[exhales]

29:31.070 --> 29:32.136
[inhales sharply]

29:34.039 --> 29:35.372
[exhales deeply]

29:35.374 --> 29:36.840
[water trickling]

29:42.715 --> 29:44.214
[Clary] What's that?

29:44.216 --> 29:45.949
It's witchlight.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.318
We carry it
to remind us that
light can be found

29:48.320 --> 29:50.287
in even the darkest
of places.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.390
And it's cooler
than a flashlight.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.591
[chuckles]

29:54.593 --> 29:55.959
Here.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.104
[Clary] Is that meant
to be the Mortal Cup?

30:07.106 --> 30:08.405
[Jace] Yeah.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.275
[Clary] What's that say?

30:11.277 --> 30:13.310
It's the Shadowhunter
creed.

30:13.312 --> 30:16.413
"Looking better in black
than the widows
of our enemies."

30:16.415 --> 30:17.848
[chuckles]

30:17.850 --> 30:19.149
My Latin's pretty rusty,

30:19.151 --> 30:21.985
but I'm almost positive
that's not what that says.

30:24.190 --> 30:27.991
"For Shadowhunters,
the descent
into hell is easy."

30:30.462 --> 30:32.329
That should be
a postcard. [scoffs]

30:33.632 --> 30:34.898
It's this way.

30:49.782 --> 30:51.181
I'm sorry...

30:51.183 --> 30:55.052
about what I said
before about your mom.
I didn't know.

30:55.054 --> 30:57.254
It's cute. You assume
I have feelings.

30:58.123 --> 30:59.189
I don't.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.059
Save the apologies
for the mundanes.

31:02.061 --> 31:05.329
Everyone has a sad song.
My mother died
when I was a baby.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.631
My father died
when I was ten.
I'm so sorry.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.333
[sighs]

31:09.335 --> 31:12.970
Wait, is he...
is he buried here?

31:14.807 --> 31:16.039
No.

31:17.176 --> 31:20.210
Circle members are
considered traitors.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.812
They forfeit their right
to be buried here.

31:21.814 --> 31:23.981
Your dad was
in the Circle, too?

31:23.983 --> 31:26.316
My father tried to
do the right thing

31:26.318 --> 31:28.819
and leave the Circle
and it cost him his life.

31:30.856 --> 31:34.892
That's why
you're doing all this,
why you're helping me.

31:36.028 --> 31:39.096
Valentine and his
people need to pay.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.397
I'm gonna make them pay.

31:42.835 --> 31:45.836
For, um...
for what it's worth...

31:46.438 --> 31:48.338
I'm still sorry.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.209
No more "I'm sorry's."

31:52.211 --> 31:53.911
You're a Shadowhunter now.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.426
[Clary] I've
drawn this before.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.796
But I don't know
what it means.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.831
It means "clairvoyance."

32:15.567 --> 32:16.867
[Clary gasps]

32:19.705 --> 32:21.271
[breath trembling]

32:27.880 --> 32:30.113
[man in deep voice]
Shadowhunters...
[Clary gasps]

32:43.062 --> 32:44.561
[breath trembling]

32:45.464 --> 32:46.863
[Silent Brother]
Come into the circle.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.871
Step away, Jace Wayland.

32:56.008 --> 32:57.541
I'll be right here.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.079
[Silent Brother]
The search of
your unconscious...

33:02.081 --> 33:03.680
is a perilous one.

33:03.682 --> 33:08.251
Please...
my memories were blocked.
I have to get them back.

33:08.253 --> 33:10.420
If you are not
strong enough...

33:10.422 --> 33:13.857
the Soul-Sword
will kill you.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.262
You're more powerful
than you know.

33:19.264 --> 33:20.697
Clary freakin' Fray,
you can do anything.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.466
Remember you were
born to do this.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.935
You're one of us.
You're a Shadowhunter.

33:26.772 --> 33:27.904
I'm ready.

33:30.876 --> 33:33.810
So, is cracking
someone's mind open
supposed to take this long?

33:33.812 --> 33:37.114
Maybe we, or...
you should go check?

33:37.116 --> 33:38.181
Jace has it covered.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.816
[chuckles] Take
my word for it.

33:39.818 --> 33:43.720
The Silent Brothers
are quite unpleasant.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.790
That's not helping.
Not at all.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.625
What if Clary can't
handle the Brothers?

33:48.627 --> 33:50.961
[stammers] What does that--
It literally
never stops talking.

33:50.963 --> 33:52.796
[scoffs] Is he
always so charming?

33:52.798 --> 33:54.231
[Isabelle] Firstborn.

33:54.232 --> 33:55.665
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

33:55.667 --> 33:59.469
Mmm. I feel his pain.
Only son.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.471
Mother wants me
to be a CPA.

34:01.473 --> 34:02.806
[Isabelle] Hmm.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.743
And you? What do you want?

34:06.745 --> 34:08.045
Me?

34:08.914 --> 34:11.548
Um... well, I'm in a band.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.482
Yeah?

34:12.484 --> 34:14.651
What type of music?

34:14.653 --> 34:16.319
Let me guess.

34:16.321 --> 34:17.421
Indie rock?

34:17.423 --> 34:18.522
[chuckles nervously] Yeah.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.223
[chuckles] Got
anything on your phone?

34:20.225 --> 34:23.060
I do.
We recorded our last set.
We killed. It's...

34:24.763 --> 34:26.096
I left my phone
in the van. [chuckles]

34:26.098 --> 34:28.331
Let's go get it.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.333
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:30.335 --> 34:32.202
[Alec] Where is it going?

34:32.204 --> 34:33.737
We'll be right back.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.572
What?

34:36.175 --> 34:37.774
He passes the time.

34:37.776 --> 34:39.643
[Simon] I can hear
you guys, you know?

34:42.448 --> 34:43.914
[cell phone chimes]

34:47.052 --> 34:48.718
Just a second.

34:48.720 --> 34:49.686
Yeah?

34:49.688 --> 34:51.955
Um, uh, trying to
pick the right clip.

34:51.957 --> 34:53.857
[rattling]
[Isabelle] What was that?

34:55.227 --> 34:57.794
I'll be right back.
Whatever you do,
do not leave the van.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.429
Got it, yeah.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.332
I'm not going anywhere.
[locks door]

35:06.371 --> 35:07.871
[sighs heavily]

35:12.878 --> 35:15.779
[guitar music playing
through headphones]

35:20.786 --> 35:21.952
[gasps]

35:24.556 --> 35:27.491
[Silent Brother]
The Soul-Sword reveals all.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.459
[Clary breathing heavily]

35:30.129 --> 35:31.962
[voices chanting indistinctly]

35:39.338 --> 35:40.637
[chuckles] No way.

35:41.974 --> 35:43.073
Really?

35:44.510 --> 35:45.408
Huh.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.477
[footsteps approaching]
[gasps]

35:47.479 --> 35:48.845
Simon, I gotta go.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.281
Luke... no.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.250
All this lying
is destroying you.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.985
Stop blocking her memory
and tell her the truth.

35:54.987 --> 35:57.354
I can't.
You know I can't.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.589
[Luke] You're just
delaying the inevitable.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.659
Clary's a Shadowhunter.
There's nothing you
can do to change that.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.762
This world
is too dangerous.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.597
If anyone knew
who she really was,

36:07.599 --> 36:09.666
the risks would be
a hundred times greater.

36:09.668 --> 36:12.435
[Luke] What happens
when she finds out
the truth on her own?

36:12.437 --> 36:15.005
And then what?
I won't let that happen.

36:17.376 --> 36:20.043
If she ever learns
about her father...

36:20.045 --> 36:22.779
if she ever finds out that
her father is Valentine.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.514
[gasps and pants]

36:25.517 --> 36:27.817
Wait... Wait,
where are they going?

36:27.819 --> 36:29.719
[stammers] We aren't done.
We can't be done.

36:29.721 --> 36:32.622
Clary, do you know
where the Cup is?
No.

36:32.624 --> 36:33.823
[Silent Brother]
Only fragments

36:33.825 --> 36:36.126
of her memory were
accessible to us.

36:36.128 --> 36:38.795
It can't be true...
what I saw.

36:38.797 --> 36:41.298
[Silent Brother]
Your memory does not lie.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.567
You must accept
what has been revealed.

36:43.569 --> 36:46.069
I can't... I can't. [sobs]

36:46.071 --> 36:48.305
What is it?
What did you see?

36:48.974 --> 36:51.141
My mother lied to me.

36:51.143 --> 36:53.143
She lied all these
years about my father.

36:53.145 --> 36:55.445
About your father?
What about your father?

36:56.148 --> 36:57.614
My father...

36:59.318 --> 37:01.418
My father is Valentine.

37:03.155 --> 37:04.721
[sobbing]

37:23.508 --> 37:24.341
Ah!

37:24.343 --> 37:25.976
[breathing heavily]

37:31.283 --> 37:33.750
[straining]
[lock rattling]

37:38.123 --> 37:39.422
[Dot exclaims]

37:39.424 --> 37:41.091
[breathing heavily]

37:45.297 --> 37:47.597
[panting] Jocelyn.

37:49.534 --> 37:52.002
[whispering] Jocelyn,
I know you can hear me.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.673
Clary is fine.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.609
She's so brave...

38:00.712 --> 38:01.911
and strong.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.780
[breathing heavily]

38:03.782 --> 38:06.549
And she won't...

38:06.551 --> 38:08.852
Clary won't let
Valentine win.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.922
I'm so sorry.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.724
[man grunts]

38:14.726 --> 38:17.060
[glass shatters]
[both grunting]

38:17.062 --> 38:18.962
Magic a little
rusty, warlock?

38:18.964 --> 38:21.798
Should've learned
how to fight
like the rest of us!

38:22.234 --> 38:23.566
Ahh!

38:23.568 --> 38:25.068
[gasps]

38:25.070 --> 38:26.536
[both groan]

38:27.773 --> 38:28.838
[Dot sobs]

38:41.653 --> 38:43.286
You were a loyal follower.

38:43.288 --> 38:45.488
[breathing shallowly]
A brilliant soldier.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.060
I won't forget
your sacrifice.

38:51.263 --> 38:52.762
[groans]

38:52.764 --> 38:54.264
[gasping]

38:54.266 --> 38:55.598
[flesh searing]

38:57.135 --> 38:59.002
[groans]
[exhales]

39:02.274 --> 39:04.674
You were right, warlock.
[sobbing]

39:08.947 --> 39:11.348
I was never gonna let you go.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.718
[Dot screaming]

39:20.459 --> 39:23.126
What happened?
What did you find out?

39:23.128 --> 39:25.462
Valentine is
Clary's father.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.864
Wait a minute.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.666
You're telling me
this girl shows up
out of nowhere

39:29.668 --> 39:31.000
and she's
Valentine's daughter?

39:31.002 --> 39:32.736
Did it occur to you
that she might be a spy?

39:32.738 --> 39:34.804
This might be
part of her plan?
That's enough, Alec.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.639
Do you think I planned
for my mom to get kidnapped?

39:36.641 --> 39:38.308
Or... or for Dot
to be taken?

39:38.310 --> 39:40.343
Or to have a giant sword
dangle over my head

39:40.345 --> 39:41.511
and find out that
my father is one

39:41.513 --> 39:43.580
of the most dangerous
people in the world?

39:43.582 --> 39:44.914
Really?

39:44.916 --> 39:47.150
[breath trembling]

39:47.152 --> 39:48.618
Where's Simon?

39:49.154 --> 39:50.387
Where's Simon?

39:50.389 --> 39:51.554
I told him to stay
in the van.

39:51.556 --> 39:52.989
I've searched
everywhere.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.157
He's gone?

39:54.159 --> 39:55.558
I can't find him. [sighs]

39:55.560 --> 39:57.727
You were supposed
to protect him!

39:57.729 --> 40:00.397
[Clary] Simon!
Ugh, these mundanes
are killing me.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.501
[panting] Simon? No. Simon!

40:04.503 --> 40:06.436
[man] Is that
the mundane's name?

40:08.407 --> 40:10.073
I'm afraid Simon's
coming with us.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.174
[Clary] No!

40:11.176 --> 40:12.409
No, he's not
a part of this.

40:12.411 --> 40:13.576
[Jace] And
it'll be my pleasure

40:13.578 --> 40:15.178
to kill you
unless you return him.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.747
Careful. We'd be
violating the Accords.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.717
[man] I'm afraid
your sidekick's quite right.

40:20.719 --> 40:24.454
The Night Children
have broken no laws.
We're negotiating.

40:24.456 --> 40:28.758
The mundane, unharmed,
in exchange for
the Mortal Cup.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.860
[gasps]

40:30.862 --> 40:32.395
And the clock is ticking.

40:32.397 --> 40:34.464
Tick-tock, people.

40:36.268 --> 40:37.400
[Simon] Clary!

40:37.402 --> 40:39.202
Simon... No!

40:39.204 --> 40:41.104
[breathing heavily] Simon!

40:41.106 --> 40:43.740
Simon! Simon!

40:43.742 --> 40:44.808
[echoing] Simon!

40:48.213 --> 40:49.712
[dramatic music playing]
