<i>Previously on "Girlfriends'
Guide to Divorce"...</i>

00:17.159 --> 00:18.625
<i>I wasn't myself. I was...</i>

00:18.627 --> 00:20.724
Grieving your wife who
you loved very much.

00:20.749 --> 00:22.935
But it's hard for me to see because...

00:22.960 --> 00:25.023
I love you.

00:25.048 --> 00:26.547
<i>First contact since the funeral?</i>

00:26.549 --> 00:28.249
Thank you for checking in with me.

00:28.251 --> 00:29.988
I really needed this talk.

00:30.013 --> 00:31.786
I could tell. The text the other day

00:31.788 --> 00:33.564
had that SOS quality.

00:33.589 --> 00:35.590
A tarot card reader informed Phoebe

00:35.592 --> 00:37.992
that a man from her past is
coming back into her life.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.012
Damien, can I buy you a coffee?

00:40.037 --> 00:41.903
The building right next
to Rize is up for lease,

00:41.905 --> 00:43.538
and I might open up another business.

00:43.540 --> 00:45.407
You need a loan?
I can't afford this.

00:45.409 --> 00:46.942
My offer still stands.

00:46.944 --> 00:48.510
No strings.

00:48.512 --> 00:50.854
Hi.
I'm here about the listing,

00:50.879 --> 00:52.178
the guest house.

00:52.212 --> 00:53.548
When did you get out?

00:53.550 --> 00:55.831
Is that my nephew?
Tony, I need you to get out.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.689
So, looks like this is happening.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.957
How do you feel about it?

00:58.959 --> 01:00.315
Terrified.

01:01.150 --> 01:02.594
<i>I heard you had a bit
of a fainting spell.</i>

01:02.596 --> 01:04.396
Delia, what do you want?

01:04.397 --> 01:06.176
I would make a terrible mother.

01:11.305 --> 01:15.274
<i>♪ ♪</i>

01:18.712 --> 01:21.179
Hey, take a breath. Isn't
it a little fast? I mean...

01:21.181 --> 01:23.248
Screw the spreadsheet.
Screw the waiting.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.883
Screw the planning.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.418
Let's just be ballsy about it.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.387
It'll be good.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.555
Sweetheart, that's your problem.

01:30.557 --> 01:32.224
Abby, Abby! Hi, this way.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.629
Delia.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.564
Wait... When did this happen?
Just before I came here.

01:39.566 --> 01:41.433
Oh, God, I just... I can't breathe.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.335
In and out. In and out.
What happened with you two?

01:43.337 --> 01:45.437
Did he leave? I don't
want to talk about it.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.406
Talk about what?
I don't want to talk about it.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.141
We need to focus on Delia
here. This is a real problem.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.724
We need to find Delia someplace to sit.

01:50.749 --> 01:51.710
We need to get you some water.

01:51.735 --> 01:53.551
This was supposed to be a fun night out.

02:02.489 --> 02:05.109
Oh, God.

02:06.038 --> 02:07.895
We have to get up.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.461
Five more minutes.

02:10.446 --> 02:11.897
No.
Yes.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.699
No.
Yes.

02:13.835 --> 02:15.736
We should just tell him.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.271
It's part of your mental

02:19.273 --> 02:22.007
Excel spreadsheet,
isn't it? The exact date,

02:22.009 --> 02:24.443
when exactly the right
amount of time has passed,

02:24.445 --> 02:26.111
and the moment is exactly...

02:26.113 --> 02:28.013
My spreadsheets are a thing of beauty.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.948
You shouldn't mock them.
So I hear.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.483
Hey, Mom, where's my gray
shirt with the black sleeve?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.251
Oh, Charlie, you've got to knock.

02:33.253 --> 02:36.321
The door was open.
Hey, buddy, we were just...

02:36.323 --> 02:38.824
Mike was too tired to drive
after dinner, so he slept over.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.392
Mom, he's your boyfriend.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.960
How dumb do you think am I?

02:41.962 --> 02:44.149
I know you guys do sleepovers.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.969
U.C. Davis, really?

02:50.971 --> 02:53.638
Okay, well... Mr. Meyers
said you should apply

02:53.640 --> 02:55.338
to at least seven colleges.

02:55.363 --> 02:57.342
Oh, my God.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.511
It literally goes over me like a wave.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.313
College, my baby.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.981
Davis has a great business
management program.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.750
It's going to help me
get into event planning.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.696
What, like throwing
parties? That's not a job.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.821
I think that's a great
career option for you, Lil.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.390
Thank you, Mike.
Why aren't Simone

03:11.392 --> 03:13.196
and Asher here?
They're at their mom's.

03:13.221 --> 03:14.587
Oh.
Eat some broccoli, Two-Eight.

03:14.589 --> 03:16.122
Play-offs coming up.

03:16.124 --> 03:17.957
Get strong. There it is.

03:17.959 --> 03:21.294
Anyway, how are things with
Lilly and Simone? Any thaw yet?

03:21.296 --> 03:22.662
Yeah, they're getting there.
Yeah?

03:22.664 --> 03:24.764
Thawing.

03:24.766 --> 03:26.566
You know, they've recently been bonding

03:26.568 --> 03:28.301
about how much they both hate Madonna.

03:28.303 --> 03:30.103
Not Madge.
Yes.

03:30.105 --> 03:33.035
Oh, so "Redbook" magazine
is hosting an event

03:33.060 --> 03:34.907
at the Park Plaza in a few months,

03:34.909 --> 03:36.643
and Laina thinks we should buy a table.

03:37.472 --> 03:39.779
Aren't those tables like $10,000?

03:39.781 --> 03:40.965
It's a good investment.

03:40.990 --> 03:43.016
Lady Parts should be
present at things like this.

03:43.018 --> 03:45.195
We can invite the girls,
make a night of it.

03:46.036 --> 03:48.354
Remember how relaxed I
was just a few seconds ago?

03:48.356 --> 03:50.657
Can we please have
some cronuffins, STAT?

03:50.659 --> 03:52.125
Okay.
And coffee please.

03:52.127 --> 03:54.293
Hi.
It's so busy.

03:54.295 --> 03:56.039
Busy every day, my lovelies.

03:56.782 --> 03:59.465
Gratitude, but stress
like I have never known.

03:59.467 --> 04:01.434
Well, I still think you
made the right decision.

04:01.436 --> 04:03.936
Oh! Oh...

04:03.938 --> 04:05.505
Opah!

04:06.908 --> 04:07.974
Everything's fine.

04:07.976 --> 04:09.475
Coffee's on the house.

04:09.477 --> 04:11.177
Namaste.

04:17.185 --> 04:18.685
What'cha doing down there?

04:18.687 --> 04:20.952
Hey, the drain was leaking.

04:20.954 --> 04:22.722
Needed to replace the P-trap.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.525
I think I got it.
Can you say that again?

04:26.507 --> 04:27.727
What part?

04:27.729 --> 04:29.162
The part where you're fixing something

04:29.164 --> 04:30.797
that I didn't even know was broken.

04:30.799 --> 04:33.796
And you're not making a
federal case out of it.

04:33.970 --> 04:37.965
Surrounded by nuts and bolts and screws.

04:37.990 --> 04:39.753
Wait, I thought you had to get to work.

04:39.778 --> 04:41.340
I am getting to work.

04:43.726 --> 04:46.646
Oh.
Look at that.

04:46.648 --> 04:48.047
Oh, my gosh.

04:48.049 --> 04:50.483
You still got some chocolate on you.

04:51.953 --> 04:53.553
Yummy.

04:55.523 --> 04:56.622
I have to go to work.

04:56.624 --> 04:58.057
What are you doing today?

04:58.059 --> 04:59.659
More house shopping.

04:59.661 --> 05:00.960
I'm worn out just thinking about it.

05:00.962 --> 05:02.695
Why? Where are you looking?

05:03.125 --> 05:04.825
Calabasas.

05:05.767 --> 05:08.167
Don't be a snob. There's
a yard and a pool.

05:08.169 --> 05:09.736
The Kardashians live in Calabasas.

05:09.738 --> 05:12.580
You could run into any
one of them at any time.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.222
Come on.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.781
Why don't you move over
to my side of the hill?

05:16.806 --> 05:19.040
The dollar goes pretty
far in the Valley.

05:20.648 --> 05:21.881
Yeah, the dollar.

05:21.906 --> 05:24.350
It's... stretchy.

05:26.588 --> 05:30.556
Wow, I thought the girls were
doing better with each other.

05:30.558 --> 05:32.658
Two steps forward, one step back.

05:32.660 --> 05:33.793
They'll be fine.

05:33.795 --> 05:35.428
Hey, I heard about

05:35.430 --> 05:36.924
a very interesting
job opportunity today.

05:36.949 --> 05:39.098
Oh, really? I didn't
know you were looking.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.533
Well, it kind of fell into my lap.

05:40.535 --> 05:42.068
It's with the Dodgers in corporate

05:42.070 --> 05:43.780
working with marketing and strategy.

05:44.027 --> 05:46.405
Wow, my God. That's amazing.

05:46.407 --> 05:48.908
Yeah, and it'd be a
big step up money-wise.

05:48.910 --> 05:50.543
I might be able to nab that place

05:50.545 --> 05:52.044
on South Beverly Drive I told you about.

05:52.046 --> 05:54.808
On the Abby approved side of the hill.

05:54.833 --> 05:57.583
That's incredible. How
did that even come about?

05:57.585 --> 05:58.885
Colette, actually.

06:00.038 --> 06:03.022
Oh. How did... what did you...

06:03.024 --> 06:05.158
Well, you know she works
for the Dodgers Foundation.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.360
Right, yes.

06:08.784 --> 06:10.396
The Education and Literacy.

06:10.398 --> 06:11.798
Right, so I guess there was
a big meeting with the owners,

06:11.800 --> 06:13.232
and one of 'em asked about me,

06:13.234 --> 06:15.701
what I was doing and so forth

06:15.703 --> 06:16.814
and would I be interested.

06:16.839 --> 06:19.772
So... you okay?

06:19.774 --> 06:22.226
Oh, yeah, I'm good.
It's a massive organization.

06:22.251 --> 06:25.979
We wouldn't even be on the same floor.
No, Mike, come on. It's great.

06:26.004 --> 06:28.781
It was very nice of her. So, yay!

06:28.783 --> 06:31.651
Yeah. Hey, guys, no phones at the table.

06:31.653 --> 06:33.619
This isn't a phone.

06:37.926 --> 06:39.926
Can we just change the subject?

06:39.928 --> 06:41.570
Let's talk about Abby and Mike.

06:41.595 --> 06:43.095
What is going on with the job situation?

06:43.097 --> 06:45.097
He's on his third interview,

06:45.099 --> 06:46.799
and he's pretty much got it locked up.

06:46.801 --> 06:48.634
So, he is pumped.

06:48.636 --> 06:50.169
Good.

06:50.171 --> 06:52.205
He'll finally be able
to afford the house

06:52.207 --> 06:54.851
that he really wanted and, you know...

06:54.876 --> 06:57.643
Whatever. I'm so excited.

06:57.975 --> 07:00.388
Really? Because you seemed more excited

07:00.413 --> 07:01.981
about your mammogram last month.

07:01.983 --> 07:03.349
Did I?

07:03.351 --> 07:06.144
Well, mammograms are very important.

07:06.169 --> 07:08.020
Abby, it's the Dodgers.

07:08.022 --> 07:09.455
It's a massive corporation,
it's not like...

07:09.457 --> 07:11.891
I know, but why? Why now?

07:11.893 --> 07:13.526
Why is she trying to interfere?

07:13.528 --> 07:14.961
You know, she's really
got me over a barrel here

07:14.963 --> 07:17.029
because if I say that it bothers me,

07:17.031 --> 07:18.564
then I'm being petty.

07:18.566 --> 07:21.234
And if don't say anything,
then I'm a coward.

07:21.236 --> 07:23.960
Eh, I don't know that it's that binary.

07:23.985 --> 07:27.373
I'm just trying to be more open
and more spontaneous

07:27.375 --> 07:29.913
and, you know, more flexible.

07:30.178 --> 07:31.878
But this is really pushing me to limit.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.679
Hey, ladies.
Hey, where have you been?

07:33.681 --> 07:35.047
I haven't seen you in
weeks. What's going on?

07:35.049 --> 07:37.550
Wow, tummy trouble going on there?

07:37.552 --> 07:39.785
Just stress. Calgon...

07:39.787 --> 07:41.721
Take me away.

07:41.723 --> 07:43.489
I know I should say something to Mike.

07:43.491 --> 07:45.751
I just don't know exactly
what I should say, you know.

07:45.776 --> 07:47.860
Hey, are you coming
to the "Redbook" party

07:47.862 --> 07:49.829
because it would be a
great distraction for you.

07:49.831 --> 07:51.664
Yes, wouldn't miss it for the world.

07:54.602 --> 07:57.092
Coming, coming, coming.

08:00.738 --> 08:02.408
Hey, handsome. Where are your keys?

08:02.410 --> 08:06.204
Well, I am picking you
up for a proper date...

08:06.229 --> 08:08.214
knocking on the door like a gentleman.

08:08.216 --> 08:10.224
That's very cute. Zip me up.

08:15.924 --> 08:17.890
So, I got an official offer today

08:17.892 --> 08:19.492
from the Dodgers.

08:19.494 --> 08:21.360
Oh, great. And?

08:21.362 --> 08:25.564
It's good. Not as good as I would
have liked, but I talked to Colette

08:25.566 --> 08:27.066
and she says it's the
best I can hope for.

08:27.068 --> 08:28.734
So, I think I can make it work.

08:28.736 --> 08:30.770
Still afford one of
these places I liked.

08:30.772 --> 08:32.238
A second mortgage maybe.

08:32.730 --> 08:35.472
Come on. Don't want you to
be late for your big event.

08:35.498 --> 08:36.864
Yeah, it's exciting.

08:38.078 --> 08:40.998
Lady Parts on the "Redbook" red carpet.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.884
All right, do this.

08:51.059 --> 08:55.895
I have lived in Los Angeles
my entire adult life,

08:55.897 --> 08:57.930
and I have to say the
red carpet never gets old.

08:57.932 --> 08:59.865
Yeah, well, we better
come away from this

08:59.867 --> 09:03.069
with at least $10,000 worth
of power and influence.

09:03.071 --> 09:04.804
Hey, ladies,

09:04.806 --> 09:07.273
can I get you a drink?
Oh, sure.

09:08.509 --> 09:10.309
Oh, my God.

09:10.311 --> 09:11.978
That's Meredith Rollins,

09:11.980 --> 09:13.779
Editor in Chief of "Redbook" magazine.

09:13.781 --> 09:15.614
We have to go there, and we have to

09:15.616 --> 09:17.383
pitch her an idea.
Uh, what are we

09:17.385 --> 09:18.617
gonna say exactly?
I have no idea.

09:18.619 --> 09:20.553
Just follow my lead.

09:20.555 --> 09:23.255
Meredith Rollins.
Hi.

09:23.257 --> 09:25.624
We are Abby McCarthy and
Barbara Sawyer from Lady Parts.

09:25.626 --> 09:26.926
Oh, hi.
Hi. I love Lady Parts.

09:26.928 --> 09:28.594
Well, we love "Redbook."

09:28.596 --> 09:30.329
Bought a whole table.
Great, thank you.

09:30.331 --> 09:33.099
You know what? You
should do a feature on us.

09:33.101 --> 09:34.967
I mean, I know you have
that whole annual issue

09:34.969 --> 09:39.305
for women who make a difference. And we
are two experienced writers and CEOs,

09:39.307 --> 09:41.474
and we've created this space for women

09:41.476 --> 09:43.321
who want their mid-life
to be as amazing

09:43.346 --> 09:44.657
and beautiful as it should be.

09:44.682 --> 09:46.679
Well, you've never written for me,

09:46.681 --> 09:49.327
and I don't really know you.

09:50.330 --> 09:52.818
But I like how ballsy you are.

09:52.820 --> 09:55.121
Call my office on Monday, and
we'll figure something out.

09:55.123 --> 09:56.789
Thank you.

09:56.791 --> 09:59.135
Um, did she just call us ballsy?

09:59.160 --> 10:01.127
Because I've literally
never been called ballsy

10:01.129 --> 10:02.192
in my entire life.

10:02.217 --> 10:03.994
Felt good, right?
Ladies.

10:05.199 --> 10:06.499
Hi.
Thanks for that.

10:06.501 --> 10:07.833
Here you go.

10:07.835 --> 10:10.703
What's that?
That is an appletini.

10:10.705 --> 10:12.338
That is not a real drink.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.340
Abby McCarthy. Who's your date?

10:14.342 --> 10:15.941
This is Mike Brady,

10:15.943 --> 10:17.915
former shortstop for
the Kansas City Royals.

10:17.940 --> 10:19.956
Right this way, you guys.
Great. Is this gonna be

10:19.981 --> 10:21.714
your first step and repeat?
No. I've been to

10:21.716 --> 10:23.315
a few red carpet events.

10:23.317 --> 10:25.284
With Colette?
Yeah.

10:25.286 --> 10:27.787
Hello, everyone, I have
Abby McCarthy and Mike Brady.

10:27.789 --> 10:30.689
Hi, thank you.

10:30.691 --> 10:32.658
I want you to move in with me.

10:32.660 --> 10:34.026
What?

10:34.028 --> 10:35.694
With me. With me and the kids.

10:35.696 --> 10:39.331
Us, you, and your kids,
all of us all together.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.434
Don't get the house in Calabasas

10:41.436 --> 10:43.302
or Beverly Hills or wherever.

10:43.304 --> 10:45.671
Oh, take a breath.
Isn't it a little fast?

10:45.673 --> 10:48.007
I mean...
I'm in love with you, Mike.

10:48.009 --> 10:49.975
I wanna wake up and see your face.

10:49.977 --> 10:52.078
I don't wanna see you
pack a bag and leave.

10:54.215 --> 10:56.082
Hey, what...
Screw it.

10:56.084 --> 10:58.084
Screw the spreadsheets.
Screw the waiting.

10:58.086 --> 10:59.552
Screw the planning.

10:59.554 --> 11:01.387
Let's just be ballsy about it.

11:01.389 --> 11:03.657
It'll be good.

11:03.682 --> 11:05.883
Sweetheart, that's your problem.

I told you it was your responsibility

12:27.288 --> 12:29.355
to keep track of it. Go find it.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.868
I got it.

Hey, man.
Hey, what's up, Darrell?

I'm good.

12:37.932 --> 12:39.532
Good. Good.

12:39.534 --> 12:41.868
You catch that Kings game last night?

12:41.870 --> 12:43.769

12:43.771 --> 12:45.771
What? No shit.
Yeah.

12:45.773 --> 12:47.773
A guy at work, he won some
season tickets in the lottery.

12:47.775 --> 12:50.977
Ha ho.
Okay, time to go, Jordan!

12:50.979 --> 12:53.279
All right, yeah.

12:53.281 --> 12:56.449
Have a good weekend, Mom.
You too, baby.

12:56.451 --> 12:59.018
Have fun, buddy.
Hey, man, thanks.

12:59.020 --> 13:01.287
Good to see you.

13:06.694 --> 13:08.794
You know what, babe,

13:08.796 --> 13:10.696
I was thinking maybe
you could stand to be

13:10.698 --> 13:12.479
a little nicer to your ex.

13:13.487 --> 13:16.969
Nicer to Leon? Please.
No, I mean, look.

13:16.971 --> 13:19.136
Things are going good for you now.

13:19.161 --> 13:21.717
You got Lady Parts. You got a man.

13:22.725 --> 13:25.144
I know it was shitty
how things went down

13:25.146 --> 13:26.812
with him and your sister,

13:26.814 --> 13:28.648
but, I don't know, it's
the way you ignore him.

13:28.650 --> 13:30.349
You don't even say "Hello."

13:30.351 --> 13:33.133
I can't see that being good for Jordan.

13:33.697 --> 13:36.355
You really do not need to
tell me what's good for my son.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.424
You're going to have to
bury the hatchet one day.

13:38.426 --> 13:39.926
I don't remember
reading a hatchet clause

13:39.928 --> 13:41.360
in my divorce agreement.

13:41.618 --> 13:43.394
I get to be mad at him until I'm dead.

13:43.419 --> 13:45.331
You know what, you're absolutely right.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.166
I just think it's petty, that's all.

13:47.692 --> 13:49.358
Do you?

13:52.194 --> 13:54.315
Look, I don't want to

Hey. Hey.

14:07.522 --> 14:08.754
Jordan's not back yet.

14:08.756 --> 14:10.156
He called. I should've texted.

14:10.158 --> 14:15.216
They're going to be another hour.
Oh. Oh, okay. Uh...

14:17.341 --> 14:19.007
Guess I can come back.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.301
You can wait here.

14:22.303 --> 14:23.869
You want to come in for a coffee?

14:23.871 --> 14:25.271
You sure?

14:25.273 --> 14:27.039
Phoebe.
Mm-hmm.

14:27.041 --> 14:28.608
I am so happy you're coming
to the "Redbook" party.

14:28.610 --> 14:31.210
What are you going to wear?
I have no idea.

14:31.212 --> 14:32.979
But I really need a fancy night out.

14:32.981 --> 14:35.563
Babs, are you bringing your dime piece?

14:35.588 --> 14:37.850
Who? Darrell?
Is there another boyfriend

14:37.852 --> 14:39.585
that we should know about?

14:41.289 --> 14:43.322
Babs, what is going on?
Did I not get the memo?

14:43.324 --> 14:45.617
No, it's nothing like that, no.

14:45.642 --> 14:48.527
Things have been getting
a little... I don't know.

14:48.529 --> 14:50.796
Seems like being in love

14:50.798 --> 14:54.277
seems to me he thinks he
can be all up in my business.

14:54.302 --> 14:56.669
Mmm.
And now he's all "You should do this"

14:56.671 --> 14:59.975
and "You should do that" and "You
should make peace with your ex."

15:00.000 --> 15:01.340
"You should check your behavior."

15:01.342 --> 15:02.875
Check your behavior?
Yeah.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.478
So, I was nicer to my ex.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.104
To Leon?

15:07.248 --> 15:08.648
We had coffee.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.083
Wow.

15:11.235 --> 15:12.551
For Jordan.

15:12.576 --> 15:14.787
It's not good for him,
this cloud of hostility.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.330
Yeah, no, I think it's very nice.
I think it's the right direction.

15:19.608 --> 15:21.718
Why are you stalking your phone?

15:21.743 --> 15:23.029
I'm not.

15:23.031 --> 15:25.074
Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.

15:25.099 --> 15:26.932
It's just... that my
brother stole my car.

15:26.934 --> 15:29.435
Yay!

15:29.437 --> 15:31.103
Hi, Mom.
Hi, baby.

15:31.105 --> 15:32.672
Can I go sleep over at Drew's?

15:32.674 --> 15:34.640
Were you invited?
Yeah, obviously.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.883
They're right next door.
Let me text Brenda.

15:36.908 --> 15:38.944
It's fine. I already texted them.

15:40.515 --> 15:43.916
That's your kid.
Oh, my kid, huh? Okay.

15:43.918 --> 15:46.273
Yeah, he's a rolling stone.

15:47.989 --> 15:51.367
Uh, you probably need a
drink after a weekend of that.

15:51.392 --> 15:53.625
Oh, yeah. I'll take one.

Um, I won't reach out again.

29:55.606 --> 29:56.906
Phoebe, come here.

29:56.908 --> 29:59.008
It's Delia. We've got to go now.

29:59.010 --> 30:00.609
What are you talking about?
She's in a cold sweat.

30:00.611 --> 30:02.378
Ay, Dios, tonight of all nights.

30:02.380 --> 30:03.779
Okay, I'll meet you at the end, okay?

30:03.781 --> 30:05.499
Okay.
Okay.

30:15.804 --> 30:18.038
<i>I thought I'd be happy.</i>

30:18.040 --> 30:20.897
But I feel hollow and empty.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.732
Well, I know that it's a relief,

30:26.423 --> 30:29.752
but it's also disappointing.
I have to get back to work.

30:33.099 --> 30:37.459
And we've got to
concentrate on that campaign.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.628
Sure.

30:41.866 --> 30:43.365
Thanks, man.

30:46.637 --> 30:48.837
Yeah, all right, settle
down, settle down.

31:10.394 --> 31:12.833
No, I just made that up.

31:12.858 --> 31:14.124
Hmm.

31:15.922 --> 31:18.834
Can we talk for a second?

31:19.748 --> 31:20.836
Sure.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.360
About the pregnancy test.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.375
That was months ago.

31:26.377 --> 31:29.244
I know. I'm still sad about it.

31:30.025 --> 31:31.280
Why?

31:33.184 --> 31:34.917
Because I want to have a baby.

31:35.392 --> 31:36.585
With you.

31:37.051 --> 31:38.520
Like a tiny version of you

31:38.522 --> 31:40.522
wearing little tiny Prada dresses.

31:40.524 --> 31:41.857
Think about it.

31:44.797 --> 31:46.261
You know about my family situation.

31:46.263 --> 31:48.030
Yeah, yeah, no, I know that.

31:48.032 --> 31:50.432
But, look, if everyone
who had terrible parents

31:50.434 --> 31:51.867
decided to stop having kids

31:51.869 --> 31:53.936
then we'd be extinct in one generation,

31:53.938 --> 31:55.270
maybe two.

Hey. Sorry, I'm so...

32:09.954 --> 32:11.920
Where have you been?
I called you yesterday.

32:11.922 --> 32:15.683

Oh, wow.

32:20.597 --> 32:23.098
I know, I'm the least

32:23.492 --> 32:25.200
Well, no my mother...
My mother was a drug addict.

32:25.202 --> 32:26.902
So don't worry about it.
My mom's crazy,

32:26.904 --> 32:28.704
out of her mind.
Do you even want to be a mom?

32:28.706 --> 32:30.072
You were so relieved when your
pregnancy test was negative.

32:30.074 --> 32:32.341
I was! But sometimes, you know,

32:32.343 --> 32:34.910
I play out the other
scenario. If it was positive.

32:34.912 --> 32:36.545
And you had a kid with Pro-life Paul.

32:36.547 --> 32:39.147
Stop calling him that. He's good.

I'm sorry.
We're good together.

I can make peace with Albert.

32:46.323 --> 32:48.156
I can serve a subpoena.

32:48.158 --> 32:49.830
Maybe I can have a child.

32:51.172 --> 32:53.262
Okay, I'm not sure how you
connected the dots there.

32:53.264 --> 32:54.763
But, okay.

32:54.765 --> 32:56.431
I'm just considering new things.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.433
Maybe I should have a baby.

I'm not getting any younger.

33:00.037 --> 33:01.670
Oh, come on, don't
believe that propaganda.

33:01.672 --> 33:03.138
So you're going to let
your ovaries decide?

33:03.140 --> 33:04.973
Because you're too good of a lawyer

33:04.975 --> 33:07.860
to just like settle for that.

33:07.885 --> 33:09.978
I'm just mulling things over.

33:15.154 --> 33:17.299
Thank you for meeting me.

33:18.053 --> 33:21.633
You have a serious look on your face.
I do.

33:22.293 --> 33:23.992
Because I have something
pretty serious to tell you.

33:25.148 --> 33:26.962
Being with you has changed me,
and it's changed what I want.

33:26.964 --> 33:28.752
And what I want...

33:30.019 --> 33:32.019
is a baby.

33:33.070 --> 33:35.849
For us to have a baby.

33:38.191 --> 33:40.484

Uh...

33:40.746 --> 33:42.532
I'm surprised.

33:42.809 --> 33:45.013
You know, because you walked in there

33:45.452 --> 33:49.051
with a grim look on your face and...
We could get started right now.

33:49.053 --> 33:51.420
Right now?
Yeah.

33:51.422 --> 33:53.989
Yeah, okay. Grab the juice.
Okay.

33:53.991 --> 33:55.324
No, seriously. It's expensive.

33:57.995 --> 34:00.062
Thanks.

34:08.304 --> 34:11.092
Aw.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.409
What? What the hell are you doing?

34:14.411 --> 34:17.779
Uh, proposing. Jesus,
what does it look like?

34:17.781 --> 34:19.114
Why?

34:19.723 --> 34:21.016
Our conversation.

34:21.018 --> 34:23.302
Building a life together, having a baby.

34:23.327 --> 34:24.753
When did marriage come up?

34:24.755 --> 34:27.054
It didn't, but you said that

34:27.089 --> 34:28.445
you were ready to take the next step.

34:28.469 --> 34:31.293
And it sounded a lot like building
a life together, having a baby.

34:31.342 --> 34:33.074
Whoa, whoa, Paul, pump the brakes.

34:33.100 --> 34:34.773
Was I supposed to check with you first?

34:34.797 --> 34:36.264
Or call your secretary?

34:36.266 --> 34:38.233
I thought this is how you propose.

34:38.235 --> 34:42.266
The ring, the knee, bam! Done.

34:43.538 --> 34:45.405
So are you going to marry me or what?

34:48.862 --> 34:50.445
Barbara.

34:50.447 --> 34:52.014
Come here.
Now.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.815
I've got to go.
Yeah.

34:54.818 --> 34:57.152
Ugh.
Oh, that is beautiful.

34:57.154 --> 34:58.787
Phoebe.
Hashtag not normal.

34:58.789 --> 34:59.921
You're not supposed to react like that

34:59.923 --> 35:01.156
when a man gives you a ring.

35:01.158 --> 35:02.491
I just thought he'd know me.

35:02.493 --> 35:04.126
I mean, he knows about my past.

35:04.128 --> 35:05.794
I can't get married.

35:06.101 --> 35:08.230
Oh God, I just keep
thinking about Gordon

35:08.232 --> 35:11.266
and waiting at the altar
like an executioner.

35:11.268 --> 35:12.403
Yikes.

35:12.428 --> 35:14.169
So what? Do I give the ring back?

35:14.171 --> 35:15.470
Blow this whole thing up?

35:15.472 --> 35:17.139
Or do I keep it, get what I want?

35:22.131 --> 35:25.701
Delia, you know what,
you've got to make a choice...

35:25.726 --> 35:26.916
and own it.

35:27.941 --> 35:31.053
And maybe it's misguided,
and maybe it's impulsive,

35:31.055 --> 35:32.721
and maybe it's completely insane.

35:32.723 --> 35:34.423
But, if this is what
you feel in your gut,

35:34.425 --> 35:36.958
then in some sense this must be right.

35:38.996 --> 35:42.864
I mean, we are way too grown up
to be second-guessing ourselves.

35:43.215 --> 35:45.919
Don't think. Just do.

36:15.204 --> 36:17.346
Hello, beautiful.

36:17.482 --> 36:18.754
You know, I hope you are hungry

36:18.779 --> 36:20.850
because I stopped and
got some Wagyu beef

36:20.875 --> 36:23.645
that is going to knock your socks off.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.561
Great.

36:28.249 --> 36:29.915
Look, Barbara.

36:30.319 --> 36:32.728
I know you were in a
bad mood last night.

36:32.988 --> 36:34.486
Okay, and I just want you to know

36:34.488 --> 36:36.855
that I am happy to
brush it under the rug,

36:36.857 --> 36:38.824
chalk it up to whatever.

36:38.826 --> 36:40.359
Your cycle, the weather.

36:40.361 --> 36:43.162
My cycle?
Well, yeah, I just...

36:43.164 --> 36:45.030
So, I can't have actual feelings

36:45.032 --> 36:46.098
that are legitimate?

36:46.100 --> 36:47.966
It has to be hormones?

36:47.968 --> 36:50.035
Barbara, I'm trying to
let you off the hook here.

36:50.037 --> 36:52.538
Now either you take the out
or you tell me what's going on.

36:52.540 --> 36:54.406
I'm working, Darrell. I don't
want to talk about it now.

36:54.408 --> 36:56.236
Well, I want to talk about it now.

36:59.863 --> 37:01.447
This isn't working.

37:01.449 --> 37:02.714
What? Us?

37:04.403 --> 37:05.784
Are you happy?

37:07.117 --> 37:09.465
Can you honestly say
that you've been happy

37:09.490 --> 37:10.480
these last few months?

37:10.482 --> 37:11.748
Have you?

37:12.539 --> 37:15.052
I'm trying here, Barbara.

37:15.054 --> 37:17.980
I really am, but you are
making it very difficult.

37:18.250 --> 37:20.283
I don't know what's wrong with you.

37:20.492 --> 37:23.493
I don't understand what's changed.
I don't deserve you, Darrell.

37:23.543 --> 37:25.210
What does that mean?

37:33.678 --> 37:35.146
You should go.

37:39.676 --> 37:41.575
Are you breaking up with me?

38:03.039 --> 38:04.583
Hey, kids.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.580
I want to introduce you to somebody.

38:06.605 --> 38:08.705
Hey. Tony.

38:08.738 --> 38:10.090
Uncle Tony.

38:10.115 --> 38:11.956
He's going to be staying
with us for a little while.

38:11.981 --> 38:13.447
This is Anouk and Luco.

38:13.712 --> 38:16.079
Anouk and Luco. Cool names.

38:16.303 --> 38:19.349

Yeah, dummy. Mom's brother.

38:32.064 --> 38:34.471
Yeah, sucks for you.
Yeah.

38:34.496 --> 38:37.167
All right, the guest...
Guest room is downstairs.

38:37.169 --> 38:38.301
Got it.

38:45.944 --> 38:47.544
Thank you for coming.

38:47.569 --> 38:51.748
I know... last night things
ended not very well.

38:51.750 --> 38:54.217
Anything else you want
to blame me for today?

38:54.219 --> 38:57.051
Global warming, melting polar ice caps,

38:57.076 --> 38:59.656
being an attentive
partner who supports you?

38:59.658 --> 39:01.224
What you invested in Rize and Shyne.

39:01.226 --> 39:02.775
Paid in full.

39:03.762 --> 39:06.563
I went to the bank, got a loan,
small business, shitty interest.

39:06.565 --> 39:09.132
But... it's mine.

39:10.799 --> 39:12.746
Jo, I have told you over and over.

39:12.771 --> 39:14.104
That I don't have to give
you back the money, I know.

39:14.106 --> 39:15.972
But, as long as I have that money,

39:15.974 --> 39:17.498
it's your business.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.586
And when you give me advice

39:19.772 --> 39:21.444
and you give me suggestions,

39:21.446 --> 39:23.780
all I'm hearing is this voice from you,

39:24.034 --> 39:26.326
and it's saying "This is mine,"

39:26.931 --> 39:29.581
and I can't sustain it.
It's not working for me.

39:33.259 --> 39:35.959
So what? Are we done?

39:35.984 --> 39:37.283
No.

39:38.564 --> 39:41.657
No! The opposite of that.

39:41.682 --> 39:43.900
I'm in love with you, you dumb ass!

39:43.902 --> 39:47.170
I'm in love with you too, damn it!
I don't want to be indebted to you.

39:47.172 --> 39:48.772
Don't you understand? I need this...

39:48.774 --> 39:50.640
Us to be free and clear of the shit.

39:50.642 --> 39:53.243

I am breaking up with it.

39:53.245 --> 39:54.234

dinner tonight, aren't you?

39:56.243 --> 39:57.575
Obviously.

39:59.251 --> 40:02.608
I'm buying a Maserati with this.
Obviously.

40:03.299 --> 40:04.665
I can't accept this.

40:04.811 --> 40:06.244
And it's not because I don't love you

40:06.246 --> 40:07.745
or want to have a baby with you.

40:07.747 --> 40:09.247
I just don't want to get married.

40:10.671 --> 40:12.050
Fine.

40:12.052 --> 40:13.751
Fine what?
Fine, let's do it your way.

40:13.753 --> 40:15.486
We don't have to get married.
It won't...

40:15.488 --> 40:17.622
I'm making you a
great offer here, Delia.

40:17.624 --> 40:19.624
How do you know?
Because I've made

40:19.626 --> 40:21.759
that same offer before. I'll change.

40:21.761 --> 40:23.328
I'll put aside my misgivings

40:23.330 --> 40:25.296
and my reservations and my beliefs

40:25.298 --> 40:26.931
and who I am to be with you.

40:26.933 --> 40:28.900
It won't work.

40:33.524 --> 40:35.807
Someone offers you
everything you've ever wanted,

40:35.831 --> 40:38.222
and somehow you find a reason to say no?

40:38.540 --> 40:39.744
That's amazing.

40:39.746 --> 40:42.208
You'll end up feeling robbed
and trapped. I just know it.

40:42.233 --> 40:44.147
Yeah, well, I think that
you don't want to be happy.

40:48.177 --> 40:51.583
It's ironic... how well we
get each other.

41:44.918 --> 41:46.529
Really?
Yep.

41:49.176 --> 41:51.377
Wow.
Just so you know,

41:51.402 --> 41:52.587
I don't think of this as a free ride.

41:52.589 --> 41:55.156
I'd share all the expenses
with you right down the middle.

41:55.158 --> 41:56.457
Yeah, we can figure
that out another time.

41:56.459 --> 41:58.718
I don't like talking about money.

41:58.929 --> 42:00.628
The new job will make it easier.

42:01.356 --> 42:03.398
You're taking the job?
Yeah.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.900
Look, the job, with me and
Colette working together...

42:05.902 --> 42:07.902
Mike.
I don't know if that had

42:07.904 --> 42:11.644
anything to do with why you...
No, it didn't, it doesn't. No.

42:11.669 --> 42:14.342
Okay, good, because
honestly I'm excited.

42:14.344 --> 42:16.244
Something like this
hasn't come along for me

42:16.246 --> 42:18.509
in a long time. Come on, it's baseball.

42:18.967 --> 42:20.466
My first love.

42:20.817 --> 42:22.098
I know.

42:22.319 --> 42:24.052
So you're cool with it, right?

42:24.054 --> 42:27.099
Yeah. Oh yeah, you
should do it absolutely.

42:27.124 --> 42:28.924
Okay, good.

42:30.771 --> 42:34.940
So, wow. Two-Eight's mom.

42:34.965 --> 42:36.965
We're really doing this?

42:36.967 --> 42:39.000
Yeah.
I can't wait

42:39.025 --> 42:43.861
to tell the kids.
Me too.
