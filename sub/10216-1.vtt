WEBVTT

00:56.080 --> 00:57.810
-Yes, sir.
- Where are you?

00:57.950 --> 01:01.150
We're making a U-turn
and we're on our way.

01:05.530 --> 01:07.220
Let's get ready.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.160
Yes, sir.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.160
Two in the front,
the rest block the stairs.

01:12.900 --> 01:15.500
Jump him as a group.
He's one strong bastard.

01:16.470 --> 01:18.740
I told you we should call for backup.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.700
- You scared?
- Of course not.

01:22.880 --> 01:27.080
Let's hurry and finally end
this two-month stakeout.

02:10.389 --> 02:11.620
He's in.

02:14.060 --> 02:14.930
Hurry!.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.700
Grab the big guy, but let the kid go.

02:23.940 --> 02:26.000
Make sure you see him deliver it.

02:29.380 --> 02:30.210
Hello?

02:43.190 --> 02:45.350
It's been delivered.

02:46.030 --> 02:48.290
- You can't go in, sir.
- Let go of me! Stay still!

02:48.430 --> 02:50.160
Stay still, asshole.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.440
I got the goods.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.580
I'll leave right now.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.080
Bear is on the move.

03:38.580 --> 03:39.480
What do I do?

03:40.980 --> 03:43.510
- You sure about the delivery?
- I saw it!

03:43.720 --> 03:47.280
- Why isn't he coming out?
- I told you, I saw it myself!

03:47.790 --> 03:49.980
Do I jump him or not?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.220
Once he's out the door,
it's all over!

03:53.760 --> 03:54.730
Sir!

03:55.300 --> 03:56.320
Sir!

03:58.370 --> 03:59.200
Get him.

04:05.710 --> 04:06.770
Mother fucker!

04:07.180 --> 04:08.070
Stay still!

04:08.580 --> 04:09.770
Goddamn it!

04:10.710 --> 04:12.300
Fucking bastard!

04:12.450 --> 04:13.410
Grab him!

04:25.330 --> 04:26.450
Teddy bear!

04:31.570 --> 04:32.600
Let's go.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.690
We got snacks for you
at the station.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.360
Mother fucker.

04:48.180 --> 04:49.340
He got away.

04:51.890 --> 04:54.790
- Ran with the goods.
- Fuck!

04:55.690 --> 04:57.780
Don't get so worked up.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.190
Those little pricks.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.400
Crazy bitch.

05:32.390 --> 05:35.560
You squeeze it, you buy it.

05:36.330 --> 05:38.090
What do you need?

06:06.490 --> 06:07.690
Come out.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.430
Or I'll kill you.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.210
I didn't steal your milk.

06:26.610 --> 06:27.740
I'm not lying.

06:28.850 --> 06:30.480
I don't steal anymore.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.080
Hey, flowers!

06:33.390 --> 06:35.650
You know Yong-chul, right?

06:35.960 --> 06:40.120
I saw him in the bathroom
and I was so embarrassed.

06:40.290 --> 06:45.320
The kids asked if I liked him,
but why would l?

06:45.730 --> 06:49.640
And look, my tooth is shaky.

06:49.940 --> 06:52.930
Does it hurt when
you pull your tooth out?

06:53.910 --> 06:54.880
Huh?

06:55.440 --> 06:56.600
Mister?

06:57.350 --> 06:58.870
Why do I bother?

07:00.280 --> 07:02.940
I'm too old to pull my tooth out.

07:03.820 --> 07:05.150
I don't want to.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.620
Why only a dollar?

07:19.400 --> 07:21.370
You owed me fifty cents.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.670
But I put in a lot of new songs.

07:24.970 --> 07:28.100
- You have bad taste in music.
- How mean.

07:29.510 --> 07:33.570
Give that back for a second.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.450
Sausage!

07:43.690 --> 07:45.450
I like sausage too.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.860
What are you saving up for?

07:56.140 --> 07:57.070
Ta-da!

07:57.170 --> 07:58.670
Nail art.

07:58.670 --> 08:02.130
I'm the best in my class.
Should I do yours?

08:02.710 --> 08:04.840
A lot of men do it these days.

08:07.950 --> 08:10.140
Are you really a gangster?

08:11.990 --> 08:16.050
They say you're hiding
because you did something bad.

08:16.420 --> 08:20.790
And Mom warned me
that you're a child molester.

08:23.970 --> 08:24.950
What?

08:27.270 --> 08:32.070
Do you think I'm a bad guy, too?

08:35.039 --> 08:36.200
Well...

08:36.679 --> 08:38.909
You do look like the prison type.

08:42.950 --> 08:46.350
- JUNG So-mi! Are you in there?
- It's Mom! I'm not here.

08:48.690 --> 08:49.750
Hey, mister!

08:50.830 --> 08:52.220
Open the door!

08:54.900 --> 08:57.260
Mister, is So-mi here?

08:57.430 --> 09:00.490
- She's not here.
- I heard voices inside.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.900
Why won't you open the door then?

09:04.870 --> 09:07.070
JUNG So-mi,
I know you're in there!

09:07.070 --> 09:08.340
Get out here, now!

09:10.480 --> 09:12.110
Open the door.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.410
I said, open it.

09:23.690 --> 09:25.680
What are you doing?

09:27.530 --> 09:28.720
JUNG So-mi.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.730
You better come out
right now!

09:37.770 --> 09:38.970
What...

09:39.810 --> 09:41.330
She's really not here?

09:49.620 --> 09:51.380
I'm warning you.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.250
Stop luring my kid in here.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.990
If you touch her, I'll kill you.

09:57.990 --> 10:00.160
You can go screw married women,

10:00.160 --> 10:02.190
but don't mess with kids.

10:03.260 --> 10:05.230
I'll rip your balls off.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.170
If you're that desperate,
then ask me out.

10:12.140 --> 10:16.740
You're easy on the eyes.
I'd date you.

10:17.610 --> 10:18.700
Well?

10:23.420 --> 10:24.410
Pussy.

10:33.890 --> 10:35.160
Isn't it pretty?

10:45.870 --> 10:48.030
Don't touch other people's things.

11:13.030 --> 11:14.130
You had fun?

11:17.570 --> 11:20.900
Tell your boss
that I'll get his ass.

11:22.810 --> 11:25.110
Good luck with that shit.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.730
You lost all the goods I gave you.

11:42.500 --> 11:46.300
Did you think
I'd go hire you a private eye?

11:48.740 --> 11:50.700
I sent my boys after it.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.310
I'll find those bitches...

11:53.310 --> 11:56.280
This is why you scumbags
can't be trusted.

11:59.780 --> 12:03.310
Goddamn useless
developing country idiots.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.580
Who brought this fucker?

12:07.920 --> 12:10.290
Fucking Vietcong.

12:12.630 --> 12:19.190
160 million Chinese do weed,
26 on meth, and 11 on heroin.

12:19.430 --> 12:22.300
It's a gold mine.
The UN says so.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.640
Three days,

12:25.110 --> 12:28.040
I'll hold those Chinese here.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.970
You better find that sample heroin.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.370
Or I'll donate you two to
the Bodies exhibition.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.910
That's your specialty,
so you get my drift.

12:43.260 --> 12:47.420
A military in power is
what this damn country needs.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.800
You fucking little whore!

13:07.050 --> 13:08.170
Are you crazy?

13:08.650 --> 13:10.210
Where are the goods?

13:11.620 --> 13:12.880
Answer me.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.820
I did all the work.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.190
I deserve half.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.690
- Don't l?
- Fucking bitch!

13:23.330 --> 13:26.090
Listen up, Hyo-jung.

13:26.900 --> 13:31.170
20 percent is enough.
You have one day.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.470
Don't bullshit me.

13:35.510 --> 13:38.030
I can just sell it all and run!

13:40.250 --> 13:42.440
You're asking for it,
aren't you?

13:42.580 --> 13:44.070
Do you know who they are?

13:45.150 --> 13:46.450
Don't fuck it up.

13:47.190 --> 13:48.420
Fucking tramp.

13:53.790 --> 13:56.090
Like mother, like daughter.

14:06.270 --> 14:07.600
Go outside and play.

15:19.410 --> 15:20.850
I promise.

15:21.020 --> 15:24.010
I'll go when Mom's friends leave.

15:27.050 --> 15:29.080
You know what your nickname is?

15:30.760 --> 15:32.320
The "pawnshop ghost".

15:33.930 --> 15:35.790
Guess my nickname.

15:40.130 --> 15:41.330
What is it?

15:42.270 --> 15:43.700
I'm not telling.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.200
It's "garbage".

15:59.450 --> 16:01.220
My aunt told me,

16:01.320 --> 16:06.320
Mom kicked a garbage can
when she got pregnant with me.

16:06.660 --> 16:10.060
It's been garbage ever since.
Funny, right?

16:12.430 --> 16:13.700
Go to sleep.

16:16.870 --> 16:20.470
Pawnshop ghost and garbage.
Sounds like a rock band.

16:20.470 --> 16:21.410
Doesn't it?

16:23.910 --> 16:26.040
I feel like playing
video games...

16:52.840 --> 16:57.710
I DIDN'T HAVE MY SUPPLIES,
BUT ISN'T IT STILL CUTE?

17:43.520 --> 17:47.650
KIM YEON-SU

18:21.060 --> 18:22.650
What's wrong with you?

18:23.730 --> 18:25.290
What's your mom's phone number?

18:26.300 --> 18:30.130
- Answer me!
- Stop hitting her so much!

18:30.300 --> 18:31.930
Look at my son's scars!

18:32.070 --> 18:34.540
You can't even keep
these bums away,

18:34.540 --> 18:36.870
with all the taxes
I'm paying?

18:37.440 --> 18:40.680
Did your mom tell you
to glare at adults?

18:41.950 --> 18:43.440
Did you steal his bag?

18:50.690 --> 18:52.730
I didn't steal it.

18:52.730 --> 18:55.460
I just wanted to compare it with mine.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.830
You don't have a bag, you bum!

18:58.100 --> 18:59.860
Don't touch!
You'll get germs!

19:00.300 --> 19:03.770
You need an adult here
to settle this.

19:03.770 --> 19:05.030
Isn't your mom home?

19:11.550 --> 19:12.600
That's your dad?

19:15.280 --> 19:17.380
Excuse me, sir!

19:18.620 --> 19:21.020
- Sir!
- Over here!

19:21.860 --> 19:22.720
Hey!

19:25.690 --> 19:26.920
He's not your dad?

20:08.200 --> 20:09.430
Hello?

20:09.570 --> 20:11.770
- Where are you?
- Woah.

20:12.470 --> 20:16.100
Sounds like he really beat you hard.

20:16.210 --> 20:19.240
You're smoking it up
while I'm out working.

20:19.350 --> 20:22.940
- Mom and Dad would be proud
- Not so hard...

20:24.650 --> 20:25.880
That's just life.

20:25.990 --> 20:29.010
Do-chi called.
He found the bitch.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.120
Who?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.190
The fucking dancer?

20:57.920 --> 20:58.940
Are you mad?

21:02.920 --> 21:04.790
That's why you shouldn't steal.

21:21.070 --> 21:22.740
How much is what she just took?

21:23.040 --> 21:24.170
Leave her be.

21:25.480 --> 21:28.940
Kids will learn
from their mistakes.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.040
Parenting isn't just giving birth.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.360
She's always by herself.

21:36.660 --> 21:40.020
Bring her around more often,
like the other dads.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.090
It's on me.

22:05.850 --> 22:07.320
Give me back my MP3.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.620
I don't have money,
so take this.

22:18.770 --> 22:21.170
My lucky card.
It beats everything.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.460
Bye.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.250
DARK KNIGHT

22:39.320 --> 22:40.620
Mister?

22:42.620 --> 22:44.990
I embarrass you too, right?

22:45.790 --> 22:47.850
That's why you ignored me?

22:49.230 --> 22:50.460
It's okay.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.020
My teacher and
all the kids do that, too.

22:56.570 --> 22:59.440
Mom said that if I get lost,

22:59.540 --> 23:02.530
I should forget our address
and phone number.

23:03.540 --> 23:06.910
She gets drunk and
says we should die.

23:08.850 --> 23:12.010
Even though that pig called me a bum...

23:12.490 --> 23:14.550
You're meaner.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.250
But I don't hate you.

23:18.630 --> 23:24.190
Because if I do,
I won't have anyone I like.

23:25.270 --> 23:28.600
Thinking about it hurts me here.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.170
So I won't hate you.

23:53.590 --> 23:54.530
Mom?

25:07.370 --> 25:09.340
We're looking for something.

25:09.570 --> 25:11.060
You're going to help us.

25:20.180 --> 25:24.280
Do I look like a
fucking school bully?

25:32.330 --> 25:33.260
Get out.

25:47.710 --> 25:48.830
Did you find it?

25:49.210 --> 25:50.140
The thing is...

25:51.910 --> 25:54.310
Things got a bit interesting up here.

26:25.980 --> 26:29.610
- Who are you?
- You came to the wrong place.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.840
I didn't call the cops,
so just go.

26:32.550 --> 26:34.280
How thoughtful of you.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.580
We'll go once we get our goods.

26:39.330 --> 26:43.630
PARK Hyo-jung gave you
a camera bag yesterday.

26:43.630 --> 26:44.690
Hand it over.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.030
A day is worth half-month interest.

26:48.030 --> 26:50.170
80 dollars capital
and 4 percent interest.

26:50.170 --> 26:51.800
Deals must be made in person.

26:55.540 --> 26:56.740
Is that so?

26:56.980 --> 26:57.880
I had no idea.

26:58.310 --> 26:59.210
But what will we do?

27:00.610 --> 27:02.180
Get over here.
Say something!

27:02.180 --> 27:03.080
- Mom!
- Talk!

27:03.080 --> 27:05.020
- Don't! Stop it!
- Go ahead, talk!

27:07.520 --> 27:09.850
- You little bitch!
- Mommy!

27:10.160 --> 27:12.020
Are you okay?
Mommy!

27:12.490 --> 27:14.860
Wake up, Mom!

27:15.700 --> 27:17.960
Mommy!

27:18.060 --> 27:19.960
She can't go right now.

27:20.070 --> 27:21.000
How much?

27:21.500 --> 27:24.270
You want these two to die for that?

27:56.340 --> 27:57.500
Fucking...

28:54.930 --> 28:57.990
Mister! Mister!

29:01.400 --> 29:02.840
Save me!

29:02.840 --> 29:04.200
Mister!

29:14.810 --> 29:16.010
Mister...

29:21.320 --> 29:24.050
You couldn't handle one fucking guy?

29:24.720 --> 29:26.560
Boxing? Karate?

29:27.030 --> 29:28.050
Was he that good?

29:28.190 --> 29:31.630
I'm telling you,
you should've seen him.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.930
He was so fucking fast.

29:34.130 --> 29:36.400
Don't you think...

29:37.570 --> 29:40.200
- Forget it.
- No big deal.

29:40.870 --> 29:42.000
This is good.

29:42.710 --> 29:44.640
We needed a fall guy anyway.

30:01.660 --> 30:02.760
You're saying...

30:02.760 --> 30:06.460
Your neighbor and her kid got
kidnapped by drug dealers?

30:06.670 --> 30:07.690
Is that right?

30:07.970 --> 30:10.090
- Yes.
- Is she really your neighbor?

30:10.770 --> 30:13.600
Just give me your address.
I'll send a squad car.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.330
Hello?

30:17.980 --> 30:19.880
You can't give me
your address, can you?

30:22.180 --> 30:23.520
Look, sir.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.750
If you're that lonely,
call information instead.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.810
They have prettier voices,
all right?

30:48.010 --> 30:49.910
I'll do as you say.

30:51.210 --> 30:52.910
Don't hurt them.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.720
You made the
right choice, mister.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.650
You just have to
do one delivery for us.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.970
- What do you think?
- Impressive.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.300
Open the glove box.

32:11.420 --> 32:12.480
OUT OF ORDER

32:25.570 --> 32:29.040
Go to the driving range and
ask for OH Myung-kyu.

32:29.040 --> 32:32.380
Deliver it at 6 P.M.
Be on time.

32:32.610 --> 32:34.380
Toss the phone once I hang up.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.580
When will you let them go?

32:39.890 --> 32:42.720
There's a soup place
around the corner.

32:43.060 --> 32:45.790
I got a table at 9 P.M.,
so look there.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.190
Look at these petty thieves.

33:28.430 --> 33:31.100
- Where's the murder, the meat?
- You wish.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.500
Fuck my life.

33:36.010 --> 33:37.500
This is NOH, DEA department.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.170
That's right.

34:18.650 --> 34:20.280
Welcome. Come this way.

34:22.290 --> 34:23.150
Over here.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.730
Nice to meet you.

34:31.929 --> 34:33.090
- Was that right?
- Yes.

34:33.370 --> 34:35.199
- Good.
- Have a seat.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.639
- He came alone?
- Yes, sir.

34:44.340 --> 34:47.340
These Chinese got spunk, don't they?

34:49.219 --> 34:50.580
Hurry up, then.

34:54.489 --> 34:58.290
Tell him it's imported
and I hope he likes it.

34:58.290 --> 35:00.690
Be polite. Dandy, you hear?

35:00.690 --> 35:01.460
Yes, sir.

35:06.370 --> 35:07.260
Go on!

35:12.410 --> 35:17.500
Saw some gangster films, eh?
May as well be at a funeral.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.350
- Should I translate?
- If you want to die.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.320
Does he think it's poisoned?

35:24.320 --> 35:25.980
Try the goddamn tea.

35:28.390 --> 35:30.180
Are you OH Myung-kyu?

35:37.060 --> 35:38.830
I delivered it as promised.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.860
Hand them over.

35:41.470 --> 35:42.430
What is this?

35:43.470 --> 35:46.870
- Who the hell sent you?
- I made the delivery.

35:47.940 --> 35:50.570
- Keep your word.
- What is he saying?

35:53.950 --> 35:55.380
Did you get the goods?

35:55.680 --> 35:56.740
Man-seok?

36:13.270 --> 36:16.140
You trying to dump this shit on me?

36:16.140 --> 36:17.230
Why not?

36:17.600 --> 36:20.660
You thought I'd just let you
take my business?

36:20.940 --> 36:23.070
You think you'll get away with this?

36:23.940 --> 36:25.210
Mr. OH.

36:25.440 --> 36:29.180
Mister fucking OH Myung-kyu.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.510
One word of advice.

36:32.050 --> 36:35.050
Kiss all the ass you can,
but you're fucked.

36:35.050 --> 36:36.850
You got that, bitch?

36:37.220 --> 36:39.160
If you want to live, then run!

36:39.160 --> 36:42.260
You fucking gold mother fucker!

36:42.260 --> 36:43.960
Mother fucker!

36:52.510 --> 36:54.000
Hey, Chinese major.

36:55.170 --> 36:56.700
There goes your paycheck!

36:57.410 --> 36:58.310
You fucker!

36:59.110 --> 37:00.510
Get over here!

37:00.510 --> 37:01.500
Grab him!

37:07.020 --> 37:09.290
What the fuck?

37:09.290 --> 37:10.120
Get my jacket!

37:17.830 --> 37:19.200
Goddamn bastards.

37:21.070 --> 37:21.970
Hey!

37:22.770 --> 37:24.240
Throw him to the cops.

37:27.470 --> 37:29.170
You three go this way.

37:30.910 --> 37:31.840
Block the exits!

38:22.760 --> 38:24.130
What the hell?

40:21.780 --> 40:22.840
LEE Kwang-su.

40:23.950 --> 40:25.140
JU Jae-young.

40:25.620 --> 40:26.850
KIM Bu-seong.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.790
- PARK Man-kyu.
- Drip on the floor, you die!

40:29.790 --> 40:30.760
LEE Won-hyung.

40:30.860 --> 40:34.120
You better not water it down!

40:35.730 --> 40:39.230
- Fucking bitches won't answer me.
- We got you.

40:39.230 --> 40:41.100
No small talk!

40:41.600 --> 40:43.870
- No exchanging of urine!
- Yes, sir.

40:43.870 --> 40:45.700
Do as you're told!

40:45.700 --> 40:47.870
- No organs?
- That's right.

40:48.570 --> 40:51.010
Cornea, liver, kidneys,
skin tissue.

40:51.510 --> 40:53.710
Took everything worth any money.

40:53.880 --> 40:56.440
But harvesting isn't OH's style.

40:58.380 --> 41:01.020
- Who's that?
- Came out of nowhere.

41:01.020 --> 41:02.820
We're looking him up,

41:03.290 --> 41:05.350
but we can't link him to
OH Myung-kyu.

41:13.030 --> 41:15.730
It was crammed inside the furnace.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.940
It's too little.
They already took it.

41:19.640 --> 41:20.570
Yeah.

41:20.710 --> 41:22.070
Name is CHA Tae-shik.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.100
Lives in Yongsan, Seoul.

41:25.510 --> 41:27.880
No drug offense and tested clean.

41:30.120 --> 41:33.020
But from 1998 to 2006,

41:33.020 --> 41:34.820
- there's no record for him.
- No record?

41:34.820 --> 41:38.260
These pricks never register,
so dig into his connections.

41:38.460 --> 41:40.620
Just find his link to OH Myung-kyu.

41:41.230 --> 41:42.690
This is a murder case.

41:56.780 --> 41:59.510
21 Dongja district in Yongsan...

42:01.950 --> 42:03.070
A pawnshop?

42:06.290 --> 42:08.550
A vein burst in her nostrils.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.490
You know what that means?

42:10.760 --> 42:13.420
Her heart was beating when
they got her eyes.

42:13.560 --> 42:17.000
Ripped out of her head while
she was alive!

42:18.160 --> 42:20.360
The drugs aren't half your problems.

42:20.700 --> 42:24.290
You keep playing quiet
and you're fucked!

42:24.400 --> 42:26.530
Understand?

42:27.470 --> 42:28.770
Excuse me, Detective.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.210
- Don't we get any snacks?
- Snacks?

42:33.450 --> 42:35.280
You fucking want snacks?

42:37.550 --> 42:38.920
Which one's CHA Tae-shik?

42:40.350 --> 42:42.910
- Why?
- There's a lock on his record.

42:43.090 --> 42:43.880
A lock?

42:44.020 --> 42:46.650
Here's the stuff on OH Myung-kyu.

42:46.790 --> 42:48.190
Tell Chi-gon I need to see him.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.700
But he won't be back
any time soon...

42:53.300 --> 42:54.530
DARK KNIGHT

42:57.700 --> 43:00.970
Escaped from Baron's castle.
Disappears into shadows at sunrise.

43:05.980 --> 43:08.210
All right, let's just eat first.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.270
Excuse me.

43:12.280 --> 43:13.650
I'm left-handed.

43:14.850 --> 43:17.120
Nothing beats hunger, eh?

43:17.220 --> 43:18.850
He finally speaks!

43:19.120 --> 43:21.020
We're making progress.

43:21.360 --> 43:23.090
Let's eat and get this over with.

43:47.790 --> 43:48.620
Holy shit!

44:05.440 --> 44:07.200
- Hello?
- What the...

44:07.410 --> 44:10.840
- Who is this?
- I'm just the Chinese major.

44:11.340 --> 44:14.070
All I did was ask for some food.

44:14.180 --> 44:15.550
Where's Detective PARK?

44:15.550 --> 44:16.950
Put him on the phone!

44:17.220 --> 44:18.740
Please don't kill me...

44:28.990 --> 44:30.090
Young man!

44:31.900 --> 44:33.660
Can you see that plate number?

44:37.870 --> 44:38.870
What?

44:38.870 --> 44:42.140
See if it's my son's van,
would you?

44:43.280 --> 44:44.380
What's the number?

44:44.380 --> 44:45.870
It's 5124.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.550
It's right, 5124!

44:56.620 --> 44:57.610
Let go of me!

45:34.030 --> 45:35.690
Let's go meet Mommy.

46:14.070 --> 46:16.900
- Come up.
- What about my mom?

46:17.370 --> 46:19.060
You don't come up,
you won't see her.

46:34.350 --> 46:35.750
Open the door!

46:35.750 --> 46:37.520
Please! Let me out!

46:40.230 --> 46:41.420
Open the door!

47:32.140 --> 47:33.240
6:41 P.M.

47:36.050 --> 47:37.280
43

47:41.990 --> 47:43.750
45 and 18 seconds.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.490
Six cops hospitalized

47:46.630 --> 47:49.830
and OH's files stolen in
4 minutes 30 seconds.

47:49.830 --> 47:51.560
Jung-ho's teeth are out.

47:51.660 --> 47:53.600
KWON's knee is busted.

47:53.700 --> 47:56.170
This is one complicated mother fucker.

47:56.740 --> 48:00.360
The lock code on him is 011.
Guess who?

48:01.140 --> 48:02.440
Military intelligence.

48:03.040 --> 48:07.070
A lock on a civilian file,
that's a first.

48:07.310 --> 48:08.610
I'm tingling with curiosity.

48:10.320 --> 48:14.050
There is one option.
What do you want to do?

48:15.590 --> 48:17.320
Remember the short track
incident with Ono?

48:17.620 --> 48:21.820
A third-grade kid from Korea
sent Bush an E-mail.

48:21.960 --> 48:23.790
It read, "I'll kill you".

48:24.000 --> 48:27.450
So the FBI asked us to look into it.

48:28.130 --> 48:30.440
The dirty ones are
always more suspicious.

48:30.440 --> 48:34.100
- So you're saying...
- We'll send one as CHA Tae-shik.

48:34.810 --> 48:37.070
They send us a request,
and it's a one deal.

48:37.980 --> 48:40.640
Even the NIS will have to
release the information.

48:40.780 --> 48:42.640
Obama...To Obama?

48:44.380 --> 48:46.550
You know Obama's E-mail, you idiot?

48:46.550 --> 48:48.280
To the White House.

48:54.460 --> 48:56.360
So, is that a go?

48:57.560 --> 48:58.760
Or stop?

49:02.300 --> 49:03.670
Go, no matter what.

49:09.740 --> 49:11.140
Please don't kill me.

49:11.480 --> 49:13.310
I'm telling you the truth!

49:14.280 --> 49:17.580
That bitch started it all...

49:19.020 --> 49:20.540
That's the only reason...

49:20.750 --> 49:23.020
Koreans never get shit done in time.

49:23.690 --> 49:26.490
Olympics come and they finally
start building bridges.

49:28.890 --> 49:30.360
But they're bound to collapse.

49:32.830 --> 49:35.960
You were only trying to
earn some weed money?

49:36.230 --> 49:38.330
And no one is behind it?

49:38.900 --> 49:40.000
Fucking prick.

49:41.070 --> 49:43.200
Then who's that pawnshop bastard?

49:43.510 --> 49:46.670
- He's with you, isn't he?
- What pawnshop?

49:52.450 --> 49:53.650
Counting to three.

49:53.850 --> 49:56.520
Then I'll torch your prick.
One.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.220
Please forgive me!

49:58.390 --> 50:00.630
- Two.
- Don't kill me!

50:00.630 --> 50:03.000
Please don't kill me!

50:03.000 --> 50:04.260
- Three.
- Please don't!

50:15.740 --> 50:17.500
You fucking startled me!

50:18.240 --> 50:20.010
You're wasting your time.

50:20.250 --> 50:21.740
The food is here.
Let's eat.

50:25.280 --> 50:27.980
Can't you signal before you cut in?

50:30.890 --> 50:32.880
I don't believe
that pawnshop bastard.

50:32.990 --> 50:35.960
Only an idiot would not
call the cops.

50:35.960 --> 50:37.600
Who cares?
This is our town.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.720
- What about OH?
- I sent Ramrowan.

50:40.630 --> 50:41.690
Alone?

50:42.770 --> 50:44.070
This is Dolce and Gabbana!

50:44.070 --> 50:47.200
Goddamn it.
I just bought it yesterday!

50:47.310 --> 50:49.400
- Alone, again?
- Yes!

50:49.510 --> 50:51.140
I told you not to send him alone.

50:53.150 --> 50:55.880
That sick bastard
likes going rogue anyway.

51:01.850 --> 51:04.290
Let me go, just this once!

51:04.790 --> 51:07.760
I'll double what they pay you!

51:07.890 --> 51:09.260
Please let me go!

51:14.030 --> 51:16.690
Once we refine the meth in here,

51:16.800 --> 51:19.970
we'll both be set for life!

51:36.250 --> 51:38.090
Hey, I got it!

51:38.620 --> 51:39.890
I got it.

51:40.190 --> 51:42.020
The dead woman's daughter.

51:42.590 --> 51:45.890
She ran errands for CHA
and came here sometimes.

51:46.200 --> 51:49.100
PARK Hyo-jung and
CHA were lovers.

51:49.230 --> 51:51.400
Kid runs the deliveries.
It's a perfect fit!

51:51.600 --> 51:52.970
Game set!

51:54.010 --> 51:56.800
So his lover was cut open
and her eyes ripped out?

51:57.510 --> 51:58.600
By CHA Tae-shik?

51:59.580 --> 52:00.670
No?

52:02.750 --> 52:04.840
Still no trace of the daughter?

52:05.450 --> 52:06.940
Who's got time for her?

52:07.190 --> 52:08.620
With OH Myung-kyu on the loose.

52:13.020 --> 52:14.580
- Hello?
- I got it.

52:15.690 --> 52:16.820
CHA Tae-shik.

52:22.300 --> 52:24.370
Just get on with it!

52:24.370 --> 52:25.270
Yes, sir.

52:27.540 --> 52:30.980
This is the information
we received from the U.S.

52:33.110 --> 52:34.010
CHA Tae-shik.

52:34.110 --> 52:38.820
A Special Forces agent in
the Army Intelligence Command.

52:38.820 --> 52:41.720
Completed classified
missions from '98 to 2006.

52:41.850 --> 52:45.620
A drill instructor
for specialized forces.

52:45.620 --> 52:48.130
Received a gold star
and a military merit order.

52:48.130 --> 52:51.820
Say hello to your guarantor,
gentlemen.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.500
He's got bad credit...

52:53.500 --> 52:57.400
Mainly enemy raids, munitions,
assassination and kidnap.

52:57.500 --> 52:59.840
Specializes in secret
foreign operations.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.000
How much do you need?

53:01.970 --> 53:03.460
You sold this here?

53:05.210 --> 53:07.680
There's been some kind of mix-up.

53:07.810 --> 53:11.210
We do loans, not telephones.

53:11.350 --> 53:14.180
Tell me who bought it
and you won't get hurt.

53:19.930 --> 53:22.330
What are you, a cop?

53:22.330 --> 53:26.290
The brutal training program is
said to have made

53:26.430 --> 53:29.370
some congressman
faint from shock.

53:29.370 --> 53:30.800
That's all we know.

53:35.740 --> 53:36.400
Fuck!

53:56.360 --> 53:59.460
He bought dozens at a time.
A harvester.

54:00.500 --> 54:03.260
He deals hearts, livers,
things like that.

54:03.600 --> 54:06.090
After a car accident in 2006,

54:06.270 --> 54:09.500
CHA Tae-shik's official records
have stopped.

54:09.940 --> 54:11.030
Gunshot wounds?

54:11.480 --> 54:15.780
Unlike the other passenger,
CHA was taken to a military hospital.

54:16.050 --> 54:18.280
According to his surgeon,

54:18.380 --> 54:20.320
he was shot,
not in a car accident.

54:20.450 --> 54:23.250
Who the hell is this kid?

54:23.520 --> 54:24.920
Who was the other passenger?

54:25.090 --> 54:27.820
His wife.
She died at the scene.

54:30.360 --> 54:32.130
We got a lead on CHA.

54:40.710 --> 54:42.040
Where are you?

54:42.270 --> 54:43.170
Yes.

54:43.380 --> 54:47.140
This isn't online shopping.
We need to talk in person.

54:47.650 --> 54:48.540
Yes.

54:52.480 --> 54:54.450
The dream of a longer life,

54:54.690 --> 54:57.450
it's not about eating health food.

54:58.890 --> 55:01.320
We'll go over the medical records.

55:01.830 --> 55:02.720
All right.

55:17.410 --> 55:18.400
Come on, baby!

55:18.880 --> 55:20.810
You'll ruin the taste.

55:23.210 --> 55:24.480
Ever hear this before?

55:25.120 --> 55:26.580
Dupont!

55:37.260 --> 55:38.750
Bottoms up.

55:42.230 --> 55:43.200
Cheers.

55:46.000 --> 55:46.990
You're serious?

55:47.240 --> 55:50.170
If I find him,
you'll rip up my loan contract?

55:52.710 --> 55:55.240
- Just tell me where he is.
- Okay.

55:57.620 --> 55:59.170
Yeah.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.210
He stole their car.

56:01.390 --> 56:03.010
We got him crossing the bridge.

56:03.150 --> 56:05.710
And we tracked
Dochi's phone there too.

56:06.390 --> 56:07.520
Be careful.

56:28.310 --> 56:30.300
- Welcome back, sir.
- Thanks.

56:47.370 --> 56:48.560
First time here?

56:52.700 --> 56:54.260
They've got great girls.

56:55.040 --> 56:56.230
Hot and steamy.

56:58.880 --> 57:01.240
But it's looking bleak tonight.

57:01.380 --> 57:03.350
It's usually a sure thing here.

57:08.450 --> 57:09.480
Hey.

57:10.490 --> 57:12.220
I think tonight's a bust.

57:13.060 --> 57:14.290
No fish in the sea.

57:16.090 --> 57:17.220
Let's go somewhere else.

57:23.170 --> 57:24.260
Where's Dochi?

57:26.870 --> 57:28.770
Come out.

57:33.680 --> 57:35.370
All right! Fuck!

57:41.550 --> 57:43.180
It's chronic constipation.

57:44.120 --> 57:44.990
Come this way.

57:54.630 --> 57:55.620
Dialysis.

57:56.130 --> 57:58.860
Once it hits,
you can hardly move.

57:58.970 --> 58:01.530
Since it's for your wife,
I'll give you a discount.

58:01.670 --> 58:03.710
- What's your religion?
- Religion?

58:03.710 --> 58:06.280
You need membership at
a temple or cathedral.

58:06.280 --> 58:08.770
Shows as voluntary donation
and what not.

58:08.980 --> 58:11.140
Takes two months.
Are you hot?

58:11.450 --> 58:13.110
- You're sweating like a dog.
- I'm okay.

58:18.920 --> 58:19.980
Hello?

58:20.390 --> 58:21.290
Yes.

58:22.190 --> 58:24.720
I'm in the bathroom.

58:25.460 --> 58:26.400
Yes.

58:27.700 --> 58:28.630
Okay.

58:29.330 --> 58:30.430
Who's that?

58:31.700 --> 58:33.860
- A friend.
- A friend who?

58:35.640 --> 58:37.230
Who are you? Get out!

58:38.340 --> 58:39.740
Were we expecting another one?

58:40.750 --> 58:41.910
Get the fuck out!

58:47.290 --> 58:48.310
Mister! Over here!

58:58.860 --> 59:00.590
Fucking son of a bitch.

59:06.670 --> 59:07.830
I won't ask twice.

59:08.940 --> 59:10.310
Where is So-mi?

59:10.610 --> 59:12.740
Fuck you, bitch!

59:21.150 --> 59:24.520
So, you sold her...

59:26.620 --> 59:29.390
- To the ants nest?
- I don't know!

59:29.690 --> 59:32.290
Man-seok and Jong-seok know!

59:33.100 --> 59:34.620
Where are they?

59:38.640 --> 59:39.730
All right!

59:40.200 --> 59:41.500
All right!

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:42.910
Out of the way!

01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:09.070
You scared the shit out of me.

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:10.640
Pawnshop.

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:15.440
- Weren't you at the station?
- Why did you kill So-mi's mother?

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:17.780
Hey, don't blame us.

01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:20.650
She actually saved three lives.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:23.950
And you did the delivery,
so you killed her.

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:26.690
Hello?

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:29.460
Hello?

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:34.890
- Hello?
- Is that what you did to So-mi?

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.820
What do you think?

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:40.300
Her insides are shit
since they're not ripe,

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.300
but I can sell her corneas.

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:44.780
It pays surprisingly well.

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:48.240
Five years in prison.
That's all I ask.

01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:50.780
She might be waiting
when you get out.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.950
- You only live for tomorrow.
- What?

01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:58.180
The ones that live for tomorrow

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.550
get fucked by the ones living
for today.

01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:04.990
What are you babbling about?

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:06.750
I only live for today.

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:16.240
I'll show you just how
fucked up that can be.

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:21.670
He hung up on me.

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:26.480
Report to the NIS, is that it?

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.180
We gave you information,
but you lost the suspect and drugs.

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:31.480
This can't continue.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.750
Report all files on OH and
other connected suspects.

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:37.820
Your D.A. and
I went to college together.

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.150
Let's keep things quiet.

01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:42.890
You're fucking kidding me.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.630
Are you after OH Myung-kyu
or CHA Tae-shik?

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:50.300
It was us that staked out
for two goddamn months.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.940
And it's our boys
lying in the hospital.

01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:56.840
I'll catch them, write them up,
throw them in.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.750
I'll fuck anyone in my way,
and give up my badge for it.

01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:04.820
You just don't get it.

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:11.330
A National Defense employee
tried to sell

01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:13.300
information overseas in 2006.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.990
200 million dollar's worth
of national security information.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.730
Special forces were sent to assassinate
and recover the goods.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.930
MOON Dal-seo, infiltration unit agent.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.380
And CHA Tae-shik,
from extermination units.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.880
Mission was successful,
but not without sacrifices.

01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:35.540
Isn't it beautiful?

01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:41.440
I'm so proud of it...

01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:48.490
So proud,
it makes me cry.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.800
Let me hug you.
Both of you.

01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:24.120
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:26.149
- Agent CHA!
- Tae-shik!

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.680
Look at me, Tae-shik!

01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:32.120
Call an ambulance!
Hurry!

01:09:32.729 --> 01:09:33.720
Tae-shik!

01:09:34.029 --> 01:09:35.430
Call an ambulance!

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.359
Stay still!

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:48.710
Look at me, you bastard!

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:52.040
Don't move!
You're losing blood!

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:21.070
Should I ask what happened?

01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:23.810
Get me a gun.

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:27.850
Wow.

01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:32.820
First words in three years,
and that's it?

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.150
Not a Colt or a Tokarev.

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:38.590
Semi-automatic, at least 10 chambers.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.260
Get some rest.

01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:44.730
Your temperature is over 104.

01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:28.640
One by one,
I brought the abandoned mutts home.

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:35.250
Now I can't tell if this is
a scrap yard or a dog pound.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.620
An inch higher and
that bullet would've killed you.

01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:53.060
Don't do it.

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:57.500
I don't know what it is,
but don't do it.

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:03.700
There's someone
I need to find.

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:10.340
It's only been a few days,

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.780
but I can't remember her face.

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:26.430
I should've taken a picture.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:50.460
She took out 8000 dollars.
A second-grade kid!

01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:52.530
Does that make sense?

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.600
Account belongs to
NAM Sung-shik, PARK's pimp.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.290
And it matches his statement.

01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.080
Mister?

01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:21.720
Sir, tell them I'm innocent!

01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:25.850
CHA Tae-shik.

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:30.530
I'm KIM Chi-gon of the DEA.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.560
Remember me?

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:36.500
I'll cut to the chase.

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.230
I'm going to catch you.

01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:41.860
But let me ask you one thing.

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:46.510
You know PARK Hyo-jung's daughter,
JUNG So-mi?

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:49.600
Are you looking for her?

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.710
So-mi is alive.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.020
She took out money
at an ATM near Gasan Station.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.520
Tell me everything you know.

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.120
Or you'll never find her.

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:10.200
- Man-seok and Jong-seok.
- What?

01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:12.700
They sent me to OH Myung-kyu,

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:15.600
and they killed So-mi's mother.

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:19.000
That's everything I know.

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:29.050
The broker that worked for Man-Jong?

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:31.880
JANG Du-shik.

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:34.820
Find him and start
searching Chinatown.

01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:36.060
Chinatown?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:19.930
Is it good?

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:23.240
Tell the brothers
I'm leaving with the kid.

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.000
Say good-bye.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.270
Bye.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.770
You're leaving?

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:34.050
Be good and you'll go home like her.

01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:35.120
Understand?

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:37.190
- Let's go.
- Mi-jin...

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.310
Bye.

01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:44.920
Thanks!

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:03.170
If I'm good,
I can see my mom again?

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:10.010
OUT OF ORDER

01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:48.510
Hey! JANG Du-shik!

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:50.850
What?

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.730
- Who are you?
- Who do you think, moron?

01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:56.020
I'm Jesus.

01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.560
I'm going to make you walk.

01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:04.770
Help! Over here!

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.880
- This man...
- Shut your trap!

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.070
He's hitting a crippled man!

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:10.870
It's empty.

01:18:27.730 --> 01:18:29.460
- Atten-hut.
- Atten-hut!

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:38.500
- Run to the paddy wagon.
- Yes, sir!

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:41.500
- Left.
- Left!

01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:43.100
- Left.
- Left!

01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:44.380
Left!

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.550
I really don't know.

01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:50.680
Half are in prison.

01:18:51.090 --> 01:18:53.220
The rest are hiding,
so they don't contact us.

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.560
This kid is missing.

01:18:56.130 --> 01:18:58.530
Are they even
selling kids these days?

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.760
Come on.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.300
This isn't the eighties anymore, man.

01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:12.130
Of course, they've done worse.

01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:15.840
But this isn't it.
She's just an ant.

01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:17.080
An ant?

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.210
Yeah, an ant.

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:21.770
OUT OF ORDER

01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:33.630
It's the Chinese mafia system.

01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.020
That's right, the Chinese mafia.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:39.200
All those social outcasts, you know?

01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:42.000
People in debt!

01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:46.140
They take their kids and
send them on deliveries.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.900
Who suspects a kid, right?
They're just kids!

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:52.110
Cheap to maintain,
safe from the cops.

01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:53.940
It's the perfect solution!

01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:58.050
And it's impossible to track.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.630
Excuse me, sir.

01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:55.500
Hey!

01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:58.500
Code 402!

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.270
Freeze!

01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:18.620
Put your hands up!

01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:27.300
Stop right there!

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:43.040
Kids are so dramatic.

01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:47.670
Hey, kid!

01:24:49.410 --> 01:24:50.740
Just take her away.

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:56.780
Get back to work!

01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:57.630
What is it? I'm busy.

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:05.300
Hello?

01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:09.200
So-mi.

01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:12.810
Bring her to me.

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:16.810
Pawnshop?

01:28:18.090 --> 01:28:19.650
How'd you get over there?

01:28:23.130 --> 01:28:25.120
Man-seok!

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.990
- Who was that?
- This is your last chance.

01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:33.560
Bring her to me within the hour.

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:37.070
I asked you who that was,
mother fucker!

01:28:44.610 --> 01:28:46.240
You have no idea
who you're up against.

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.410
Touch one hair on my brother's body,

01:28:51.150 --> 01:28:53.590
and I'll rip her eyes and guts out!

01:28:56.490 --> 01:28:58.960
You fucking bastard!

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.430
Tell Ramrowan to rip her eyes out.

01:29:25.090 --> 01:29:26.110
What are you doing?

01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:34.190
When the kids died,

01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:38.230
you took out their organs.

01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:44.270
Sent the liver to one district,
the eyes to another...

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.970
And the heart to Seoul.

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:53.310
Isn't that right?

01:29:54.150 --> 01:29:55.380
I didn't do it.

01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:57.820
Those young children,

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.990
wandering the country
even after death...

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:11.200
Did that ever cross your mind?

01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:13.190
What about you?

01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:17.410
You ever wonder
how much they're worth?

01:30:18.370 --> 01:30:21.000
Even their parents
don't want them anymore.

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.270
It's a win-win situation.

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.650
Am I right?

01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:30.240
Wrong.

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:34.520
Just now,

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.030
you should've apologized to those kids.

01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:44.990
Mother fucker.

01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:49.400
If anything happens to me,

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.870
you'll never see that bitch again.

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:53.440
You get me?

01:30:54.810 --> 01:30:56.040
Even if I find So-mi,

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.410
you two are still dead.

01:31:10.690 --> 01:31:11.520
Hey.

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:15.660
Wait!

01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:27.380
Fuck!

01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:30.840
Goddamn it!

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:34.720
Yeah.

01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:38.390
Hello?

01:31:45.730 --> 01:31:47.250
Say something, you asshole!

01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:48.800
Mother fucker!

01:32:15.690 --> 01:32:16.750
Hold onto it.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.290
Time to get back home.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:25.760
Where's my mom?

01:32:45.150 --> 01:32:46.020
Mom?

01:32:50.130 --> 01:32:52.920
Mommy's right here.

01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:00.390
I took her heart out.

01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:05.910
So Mommy is right here.

01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:09.970
Let's shake hands.

01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:12.250
Why?

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.020
Don't you want to?

01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:27.030
You said I could see my mom again.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.620
He's lying, right?

01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:32.630
She's not dead.

01:33:32.770 --> 01:33:35.540
She's not dead, right?

01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:37.170
She's alive.

01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:41.810
Mister, you're lying, right?

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.450
My mom is alive!

01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:51.720
Where is she? Let me see her.

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.190
Please, mister!

01:34:00.230 --> 01:34:01.460
Shit.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.090
Coming through!

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.560
Identifications.

01:34:06.570 --> 01:34:07.560
Inspect these people.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.770
Granny.

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:15.380
We know everything.

01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:18.280
Where are the kids?

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:21.850
Goddamn it.

01:34:21.850 --> 01:34:23.280
Where the hell are they?

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:25.910
Detective NOH!

01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:39.940
Yeah.

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.770
- What did you find?
- I got a name.

01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:45.710
OH Sang-man, a surgeon.
Served 3 and a half for drug use.

01:34:45.810 --> 01:34:47.210
Known as "500".

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:50.840
His goal is to cut open 500 bodies.

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.680
Track him down.

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:39.020
This is it? Just one guy?

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:40.520
There you are.

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.260
Who the fuck are you?

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:48.430
Why did you come
all the way here for her?

01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:51.460
I'm her next-door neighbor.

01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:55.430
Fucking idiot.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.340
Her next-door neighbor?

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.680
You're fucking insane.

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:05.110
- Where's Jong-seok?
- So-mi first.

01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:12.680
Hey.

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.330
Grab it.

01:36:22.770 --> 01:36:24.300
Out of the way, moron!

01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:31.900
I'll just stay over here.

01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:35.920
Catch.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.020
Strike!

01:37:14.190 --> 01:37:16.750
She went to heaven to find her mommy.

01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:21.660
But she can't find her
without her eyes.

01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.390
You messed with the wrong person.

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.590
Next-door neighbor?

01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:31.840
You think this is some fucking joke?

01:37:35.210 --> 01:37:36.580
Where's my brother?

01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:40.210
Where the fuck is my brother?

01:37:51.090 --> 01:37:53.650
- How many cavities do you have?
- What?

01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:57.760
I run a pawnshop.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.760
I take gold teeth.

01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:12.100
I'll keep the gold teeth.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.180
And I'll chew up everything else.

01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:45.970
Fuck!

01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:35.680
Where the fuck did he get a gun?

01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:37.880
Is he a cop?

01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:40.460
Move your fucking ass, moron!

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:42.650
Sorry, sir.
I got shot earlier...

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.520
You won't die, bitch.

01:41:44.690 --> 01:41:45.990
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.

01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.140
Get in the fucking car!

01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:15.070
Fuck!

01:44:22.850 --> 01:44:24.110
Son of a bitch.

01:44:38.130 --> 01:44:39.260
Police?

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.540
Someone's getting killed!
Get over here!

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:45.710
Just trace the call
and get over here!

01:44:45.710 --> 01:44:47.680
Fuck, he's here!

01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:50.340
Hurry up, assholes!

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.650
He's fucking here!

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.220
You moron!

01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:15.000
It's bulletproof, mother fucker!

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:24.570
Shoot!

01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:27.210
Shoot me, bitch!

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.150
Once the cops are here,
you're finished.

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.520
I'm not going anywhere!

01:45:43.330 --> 01:45:46.560
I said it's fucking bulletproof!

01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:14.960
One more bullet left.

01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.600
Mister...

01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:08.630
Did you come to save me?

01:49:12.710 --> 01:49:16.170
You came to save me, right?

01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:23.710
Stay there.

01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:27.420
You'll get blood on you.

01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:39.390
Mister!

01:49:40.170 --> 01:49:43.000
You came to save me!

01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:44.600
Right?

01:49:45.410 --> 01:49:47.470
Right, mister?

01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:33.190
He got his eyes ripped out.

01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:50.940
Put her in with him.

01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.870
Could I ask you a favor?

01:51:40.290 --> 01:51:41.590
Little girl.

01:51:43.590 --> 01:51:46.060
You really got into trouble this time.

01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:13.280
I'm sorry.

01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:19.790
I'm sorry for
pretending to not know you.

01:52:23.130 --> 01:52:25.330
If I want to know you too much,

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:28.670
I can't help not wanting to.

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:30.960
What's that supposed to mean?

01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:36.340
I don't know either.

01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:39.310
I've never seen you smile before.

01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:47.450
You're on your own now.

01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:51.890
You can do it, right?

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:04.700
Just once...

01:53:11.110 --> 01:53:12.880
Let me hug you once.

01:53:19.090 --> 01:53:20.990
Let me hug you, just once.

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.990
Mister...

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.030
Are you crying?

01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:08.560
THE MAN FROM NOWHERE

01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:19.270
CHA Tae-shik - WON Bin
So-mi - KIM Sae-ron

01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:21.980
KIM Chi-gon - KIM Tae-hoon

01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:26.000
Man-seok - KIM Hee-won
Jong-seok - KIM Seong-oh
