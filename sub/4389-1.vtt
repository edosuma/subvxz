01:10.160 --> 01:11.640
It stopped.

01:11.720 --> 01:12.680
What's that, Dave?

01:12.760 --> 01:13.680
Nothing.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.680
How we doing?

01:14.760 --> 01:15.880
Oh, we're ready.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
You feeling the magic?

01:18.080 --> 01:19.800
Oh, I'm feeling the magic,
all right.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.840
Let's hit 'em.

01:20.920 --> 01:21.960
Yeah.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.080
Let's do it.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.040
Here we go.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.320
Let's hit 'em.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.800
Let's go make $30 million.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.640
Good morning.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.680
Before I begin, let me...

01:44.120 --> 01:45.040
David?

01:45.120 --> 01:46.840
I'll go get help.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.360
Jesus. Jesus, David.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.400
Phone 9-1-1. Phone 9-1-1!

01:51.440 --> 01:52.600
David?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.080
Nick?

02:02.160 --> 02:04.080
Vicky?!

02:04.160 --> 02:05.800
Vicky!

02:27.360 --> 02:28.720
Okay, it's okay.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.160
It's okay.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.880
Everybody else off the bus.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.560
Sound waves.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.200
So, if we know that sound waves

02:46.280 --> 02:51.280
gain wavelength
and lose frequency

02:51.360 --> 02:54.480
as they travel
through more dense materials...

02:56.720 --> 02:59.440
...then the anomalies
in these waves

02:59.560 --> 03:02.440
are the means by which
we can surmise

03:02.480 --> 03:04.840
the fundamental architecture
of our planet.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.440
How are the nails coming,
Christine?

03:12.080 --> 03:13.560
Good.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.520
All right,
let's have a demonstration.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.920
Mr. Acker, Veronica.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.240
Thank you very much.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.760
All right.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.040
Mrs. Limestone,
being a big softie, you know,

03:25.120 --> 03:27.160
loves walks in the park,
bedtime stories,

03:27.240 --> 03:28.120
big romantic.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.160
Loves Chet.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.240
I can't play Chet,
but I'll see what I can do.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.480
Watch the oscilloscope,
all right?

03:34.560 --> 03:35.560
Here we go.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.840
Dr. Joshua Keyes?

03:44.880 --> 03:46.200
Maybe.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.800
Yes or no, sir?

03:47.880 --> 03:49.720
The first one.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.280
Please come with us, sir.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.840
Guys, wh-what's going on?

03:56.920 --> 03:58.320
We don't know, sir.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.360
What do you mean,
you don't know?

04:00.400 --> 04:03.080
Your security clearance
is higher than ours.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.720
I have security clearance?

04:04.800 --> 04:07.800
We're just here to
bring you to your jet.

04:07.880 --> 04:08.840
I have a jet?

04:23.960 --> 04:25.760
Hey, Serge.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.000
Ah!

04:27.080 --> 04:27.960
Serge.

04:28.040 --> 04:28.960
Serge.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.080
Damn!

04:30.160 --> 04:32.120
It's about time.
You're always late.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.560
Let's keep moving, gentlemen.

04:35.640 --> 04:36.680
What am I doing here?

04:36.760 --> 04:38.880
They wouldn't brief me
until you got here.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.640
You know, there are biochemists
everywhere, military.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.920
I hate them.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.520
When are you going to meet
a nice girl

04:44.600 --> 04:45.640
and bring her for dinner?

04:45.680 --> 04:46.640
I'm married to my work.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.800
So am I.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.280
Which makes my wife
my mistress...

04:50.360 --> 04:52.080
that's why I'm still
in love with her.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.640
You were always a romantic.

04:54.720 --> 04:55.760
I love my wife.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.360
Yeah, I know.
I love your wife, too.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.640
I know.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.640
But I don't love your wife.
You know what I mean.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.360
You don't love her
the same way, you know.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.720
It's the French.
I think it's the cheese.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.000
Ah, the cheese.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.760
You're...
you're teasing me, right?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.200
Oh, my...!

05:09.280 --> 05:10.960
Whoa. Wait, these are bodies.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.720
I think we're
in the wrong place here.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.120
Yeah, we're in the wrong place.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.040
No. If you were
in the wrong place,

05:16.080 --> 05:17.840
you would've already been shot.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.960
That's a hell of a greeting.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.360
Serge.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.600
Serge.

05:22.680 --> 05:23.920
Serge. Yes.
Always a pleasure.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.040
Same here, Thomas.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.160
Dr. Keyes.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.560
- I know.
- Tom Purcell.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.120
Gentlemen, you do realize
that everything here

05:31.200 --> 05:33.840
is totally classified, okay?

05:36.320 --> 05:37.680
At 10:30 a.m. Local time,

05:37.840 --> 05:41.400
32 civilians,
all within a 10-block radius...

05:41.480 --> 05:43.440
died.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.200
They didn't get sick first.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.240
They simply hit the ground dead.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.200
Nerve agent?

05:48.240 --> 05:49.160
Our first guess. No.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.000
They all died
at the same time?

05:51.080 --> 05:53.240
As far as we can tell,
to the second.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.600
This hits CNN in one hour.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.880
I need a reason.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.320
Is there a variation
in sex, age, body type?

05:58.360 --> 05:59.920
They all had pacemakers.

06:00.680 --> 06:01.640
Under a minute.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.960
Your reputation is
well deserved.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.800
- Hey, hey, hey.
- How did you guess?

06:07.880 --> 06:09.200
Without any clues
from the victims?

06:09.280 --> 06:10.160
No, that's...

06:10.240 --> 06:11.360
Serge and I are the clues.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.480
I mean, he specializes
in high energy weapons.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.440
I do geomagnetics.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.920
So calling us means you suspect

06:15.960 --> 06:18.360
an electromagnetic
pulse weapon.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.120
If these are
the only fatalities,

06:20.200 --> 06:22.120
they must be people
susceptible to...

06:22.160 --> 06:23.440
electronic interference.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.520
QED pacemakers.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.200
You're spooky sometimes, eh?

06:26.280 --> 06:27.440
Now I need to know,

06:27.520 --> 06:29.760
did some sort of weapon
kill these people?

06:29.840 --> 06:30.840
The power that you would need

06:30.920 --> 06:32.320
to create an EM pulse
strong enough...

06:32.400 --> 06:33.960
I mean, that's...
that's not a weapon that

06:34.040 --> 06:35.080
- I've ever heard of.
- No.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.360
Okay, we're done.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.280
We're not done, sir.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.760
There's nothing on the other
side of the equal sign.

06:41.840 --> 06:42.840
I agree with Joshua...

06:42.920 --> 06:44.160
Thank you.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.480
Our greatest concern was this
may have been an act of war,

06:46.520 --> 06:47.760
but since it's not,

06:47.800 --> 06:50.480
I think we can all breathe
a little easier, can't we?

07:07.040 --> 07:08.800
Look at my hat.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.200
What is it, sweetheart?

07:24.240 --> 07:25.240
It's okay, son.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.920
These things happen
all the time and...

07:35.280 --> 07:37.840
Let's, go, let's go!
Come on!

07:53.800 --> 07:54.760
Justin!

07:57.320 --> 07:59.240
Watch out, you bloody idiot!

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Hurry! Run!

08:45.680 --> 08:48.280
Daddy!

08:58.280 --> 09:01.680
The skies are empty
over Nelson's Column now,

09:01.760 --> 09:04.040
but a few hours ago,
it was a different story.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.880
Eyewitnesses claimed that
the frenzied swarms of birds

09:05.960 --> 09:08.520
were not in fact attacking
people deliberately...

09:08.600 --> 09:10.440
And it's not just this time.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.960
But seemed to be confused
and flying blind.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.640
The <i>Fortean Times</i> reported
violent bird swarms

09:13.680 --> 09:15.120
twice last month in
Australia and Japan.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.040
Five people are confirmed dead
and dozens injured

09:17.120 --> 09:19.560
in the panic that followed the
bizarre and terrifying incident

09:19.600 --> 09:21.080
in London's historic
Trafalgar Square.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.240
- Weird.
- Mm-hmm.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.560
Quite strange, also.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.560
Mm. Strange, indeed.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.960
Mm!

09:28.280 --> 09:31.000
How do birds navigate?

09:31.080 --> 09:32.160
By sight?

09:32.240 --> 09:33.800
No, no, no,
the long range stuff.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.800
Magnetic fields.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.120
Little ions in their brains

09:36.200 --> 09:38.240
align with the magnetic field
of the Earth.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.560
- Yeah, what she said.
- Right?

09:41.640 --> 09:42.680
Acker.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.600
Hit the 'Net, do a search for...

09:44.680 --> 09:46.360
oh, two years ought to do it.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.240
Any and all, like, "weird news",
you know...

09:48.320 --> 09:49.480
bizarre animal migrations,

09:49.520 --> 09:50.880
specifically birds.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.240
Whale and dolphin beachings.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.280
Unusual atmospheric phenomenon,
unexplained plane crashes,

09:54.360 --> 09:56.360
you know,
just use your imagination.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.880
That is a huge search.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.000
You can use our T-1 line
to look up Sailor Moon crap.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.360
You're up to this.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.800
Danni, Danni,
get me the brightest kids

10:02.880 --> 10:04.040
from the Field Theory Class,

10:04.120 --> 10:06.200
and design a computer model
of an electromagnetic field.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.320
What are we doing?

10:07.400 --> 10:08.920
I need a 3-D computer model
of the Earth

10:09.000 --> 10:09.880
to lay the field over.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.000
Whoa-ho-ho, the planet Earth?

10:11.080 --> 10:13.560
Yeah, the planet Earth.
You know, the pretty blue one.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.440
Map out the anomalies
that Acker finds

10:15.480 --> 10:16.960
and grunt out the equations.

10:17.040 --> 10:17.960
And, uh...

10:18.040 --> 10:19.640
grab those smelly kids

10:19.720 --> 10:21.040
from the Non-Linear
Diff class, too.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.640
Listen, Josh, do we even
have time for this?

10:22.720 --> 10:25.000
Do this and I'll sign
your doctorates blindfolded.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.200
- Blindfolded?
- Blindfolded.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.880
Do not pass Go.
Go directly to PhD.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.440
Be wrong. Be wrong.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.520
Tim, I'm coming in a little hot.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.960
Give me some drag, will you?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.680
Roger that.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.760
We are in attitude and ready
for an entry interface.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.040
Nice work, Major.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.320
I have the controls
now for E.I.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.040
I could take us in.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.280
You could...

11:54.360 --> 11:55.400
but you won't.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.520
I'm ready for this, Bob.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.880
Oh, no, you're not, Beck.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.960
You're trained,
and you're certified...

12:00.040 --> 12:01.720
doesn't make you the commander.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.600
And the commander
lands the bird.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.840
You got to be the youngest
person ever in space.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.560
You should say,
thank you, be happy.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.400
Now.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.760
<i>Endeavour,</i> Houston,
at this time

12:11.840 --> 12:13.440
we show you go for reentry.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.920
Houston, <i>Endeavour</i> descending
through 400,000 feet

12:16.000 --> 12:17.280
coming upon entry interface.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.600
<i>Endeavour,</i> this is Flight.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.200
Weren't able to annoy
the commander

12:20.280 --> 12:22.160
into letting you
bring her in this time?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.120
That's a negative, Stick.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.360
I'll have to be
more annoying next time.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.200
Is that even possible?

12:26.200 --> 12:27.120
<i>Endeavour,</i>

12:27.160 --> 12:28.800
we see you in
good entry config.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.000
Roger, Houston.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.840
Advise.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.400
I'm seeing those
plasma trails now.

12:37.480 --> 12:38.360
All right, mark 24½.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.640
So, a minute to air.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.320
I don't believe in belts.

12:45.320 --> 12:48.080
Just get me through the Earth's
atmosphere in this spaceship.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.160
Com dropout.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.800
Start the I Com.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.360
Let's wait till the...

13:05.440 --> 13:07.120
Com restored.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.160
Quiet!

13:23.120 --> 13:24.200
We are out of position here.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.000
Guidance shows us
on energy and on course.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.400
Well, I've made this approach
213 times in the simulator.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.840
We're not where we should be.

13:29.880 --> 13:30.960
Where the hell are we?

13:31.040 --> 13:34.680
<i>Endeavour,</i> guidance is bad.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.440
You are now
1-2-niner miles off course.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.760
Roger, Houston.
We sort of noticed.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.680
Is that...?

13:39.760 --> 13:41.680
Los Angeles. That is confirmed.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.280
We are 1-5 thousand feet.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.040
We got maybe two minutes
of glide time left.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.040
Doesn't make sense.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.120
The guidance,
the beacons are all wrong?

13:49.200 --> 13:51.440
We're heading straight
for downtown.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.400
We're not going to crash
into Los Angeles.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.800
They're going to hit
downtown L.A.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.800
At 300 knots.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.400
Bob, you know L.A.?
Because I have an idea.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.440
Houston, those buildings
are getting mighty big.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.920
Can you clear a freeway?

14:02.960 --> 14:04.720
Okay, thank you.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.080
Come on. Come on.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.680
It's rush hour, Commander,

14:08.720 --> 14:10.080
and it's bumper-to-bumper.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.000
Sir, I have an alternate.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.240
If you turn to heading 1-7-5...

14:15.280 --> 14:16.600
It's Houston's call. Houston?

14:17.800 --> 14:19.600
Computers are still plotting.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.760
Come on.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.800
Houston, we are running

14:40.880 --> 14:41.920
out of time here.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.640
Sir, I have an alternate.

14:43.720 --> 14:44.640
All right, Beck,
what do you got?

14:44.720 --> 14:45.680
Houston, I have coordinates

14:45.760 --> 14:46.640
for an alternate landing site.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.600
Can you confirm?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.320
<i>Endeavour,</i> give them to me.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.960
I show possible touchdown...
at 33.55 north, 118.10 west.

14:53.040 --> 14:56.360
Bill?

14:56.400 --> 14:57.960
It's theoretically possible.

14:58.040 --> 14:58.800
<i>Endeavour,</i>

14:58.880 --> 14:59.840
that is confirmed.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.760
Turn right, heading 1-7-5.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.800
Expect visual contact

15:03.880 --> 15:06.000
with Los Angeles River
in five seconds.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.400
No, that will not work, Houston.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.040
We got bridges
every few hundred yards.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.760
Our wingspan alone
is going to fold us up.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.200
I've figured the "L"
over "D" max.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.120
We can make it
if you can bring us straight in.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.200
We're coming in high and hot.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.000
290 feet, 320.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.000
- 270, 3-0-5...
- Arm the gear.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.120
You're armed.

15:30.200 --> 15:30.840
Gear down. Now.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.600
Gear in transition.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.080
240 feet, 290.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.120
Hang on.
This isn't going to be subtle.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.160
210 feet, 265.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.960
Get out of the way! Move!

15:52.240 --> 15:53.200
Derotate.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.360
Inward.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.200
230... 210...

16:01.280 --> 16:02.600
Speed brakes!

16:02.640 --> 16:03.880
100%.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.160
Oh, we're way too fast.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.280
Deploy the chute.

16:06.320 --> 16:09.040
No. We'd snag the bridge.
We'll tear the tail off.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.520
Banking right.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.000
Commander, that next bridge!

16:19.080 --> 16:20.040
Watch it!

16:20.080 --> 16:22.200
We're way too high
for that one!

16:22.280 --> 16:23.160
Suck up the gear!

16:23.240 --> 16:24.240
Not yet.
We'll lose all steering.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.520
We hit, it's over!

16:29.520 --> 16:31.440
And... gear up now!

16:37.360 --> 16:39.080
Lock your harnesses.
This is out of my hands.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.200
Let's get out of here!

16:56.240 --> 16:58.480
Run! Let's get out!

17:39.120 --> 17:40.520
Dr. Zimsky?!

17:40.560 --> 17:42.640
Will you make sure
my assistant has

17:42.720 --> 17:43.600
your number, darling?

17:43.680 --> 17:44.560
Sure.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.520
- Dr. Zimsky!
- Hello.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.480
I'll call security.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.440
No, it's all right.
It's all right. Hello.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.400
Thank you, sir.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.120
- Dr. Zimsky.
- Yes. What's your name?

17:51.200 --> 17:52.080
- Josh Keyes.
- Josh.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.880
No, sir, I don't need you
to sign it.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.080
I need you to read that.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.440
I'm sorry, I don't have time.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.680
- I'm late for the White House.
- Sir, please.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.400
I need you to confirm
my results, sir.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.640
Young man, do you have any idea
who I am?

18:02.720 --> 18:04.680
Yes, I do, sir.
Please read this.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.840
What's it about?

18:08.920 --> 18:13.040
It's the end of the world.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.080
No, I... this is impossible.
I'm sorry.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.800
I-I-I can't have missed this.

18:40.880 --> 18:41.800
You-You have to be wrong.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.080
I mean, look, I'm sure

18:43.160 --> 18:45.280
with careful comparison
to my own work,

18:45.360 --> 18:46.560
we'll find that
you are mistaken.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.000
No offense, but...

18:48.080 --> 18:49.760
Well, I mean,
we'll know soon enough.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.680
The bigger effects will start up
any day now.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.280
Rebecca?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.880
Only you and Dad
ever call me that.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.640
Well, Beck.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.080
So, what brings you
to sunny D.C.?

19:59.120 --> 20:00.920
The Board of Review
is next week.

20:02.880 --> 20:06.000
Just trying to get a sense
of the mood upstairs.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.160
How bad is it?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.720
Your crew crashed
the space shuttle.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.520
Now, how good do you
think it could be?

20:12.560 --> 20:13.880
Sir, this is my life.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.000
Well...

20:15.080 --> 20:17.200
I was studying for the academy
when I was 13.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.440
It still is and has always been
my life.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.160
It's over.

20:21.240 --> 20:24.280
It's over, Rebecca.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.920
I'm sorry.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.560
It's right down here.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.520
Really?

20:28.560 --> 20:29.440
It's like the 4th of July.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.600
What the hell's the hurry here?

20:34.240 --> 20:36.280
Rebecca, would you excuse me,
please?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.960
Excuse me.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.080
Purcell.

20:42.160 --> 20:47.560
Thomas, um, look...

20:47.640 --> 20:50.120
it seems that destiny
may have caught up with us.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.160
Did Zimsky really try
to give you his autograph?

21:14.480 --> 21:16.720
Ah, Monsieur Zimsky.

21:16.760 --> 21:17.800
Conrad Zimsky.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.200
Herr Zimsky.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.560
Superstar.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.120
Oh...

21:26.800 --> 21:29.520
I think I skipped drunk.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.600
Went right to hangover.

21:32.680 --> 21:35.560
Weren't you the one?

21:35.600 --> 21:37.080
I spoke with the kids.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.400
They don't sleep at night.

21:39.440 --> 21:44.360
They look at the sky, and...
and they think it's pretty.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.280
Is there any chance
you're wrong?

21:47.440 --> 21:48.920
No. The sky, man.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.560
The sky... I mean,
that's just the beginning.

21:50.640 --> 21:51.960
That's high-altitude
static discharge.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.840
I know.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.400
Dr. Keyes...

21:58.400 --> 22:00.520
...your presence is
required at the Pentagon.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.960
Ah... it's my best buddies.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.400
Hey!

22:04.480 --> 22:06.280
Why don't you join
us for a drink?

22:06.320 --> 22:08.800
We'd be grateful if you could
join us for a ride, sir.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.600
And if I were to say no?

22:10.640 --> 22:11.960
- Just asking.
- Yeah.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.120
Well, we have
no sense of humor.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.240
That's true.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
Oh...

22:17.480 --> 22:19.360
And we're armed.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.800
Thank you.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.160
Dr. Keyes, welcome.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.480
Thank you.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.680
Dr. Zimsky informs us

22:30.760 --> 22:32.600
that you made a
useful contribution

22:32.680 --> 22:34.600
to his investigations,
so he wanted you

22:34.640 --> 22:36.040
to assist him
in the briefing.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.720
That's very generous of you,
Dr. Zimsky.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.000
Science is a selfless business,
dear boy.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.920
Now, why don't you begin,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.560
and I'll fill in
all the difficult bits.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.400
All right, I'll put this
as simply as I can.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.520
Everybody on Earth
is dead in a year.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.040
And let me explain why.

22:58.120 --> 23:01.800
Wrapped around the Earth
is an invisible field of energy.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.480
It's made up of...
electricity and magnetism,

23:04.560 --> 23:06.360
so it's called...
creatively enough...

23:06.440 --> 23:07.800
the electromagnetic field.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.920
It's where we get our magnetic
North Pole and South Pole,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.160
and it protects us
from cosmic radiation.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.920
So this EM field is our friend.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.800
But now...?

23:16.880 --> 23:18.200
But now,

23:18.280 --> 23:19.760
that field is falling apart.

23:19.840 --> 23:20.840
Why?

23:20.880 --> 23:22.440
Why?

23:24.200 --> 23:25.840
This here.

23:27.680 --> 23:30.000
Does somebody have a can
of air freshener?

23:34.360 --> 23:36.400
Quick and dirty.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.240
The thin skin,
that's the Earth's crust.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.920
That's what we live on.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.120
It's 30 miles thick.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.840
The meat here,
call it the mantle.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.600
And forgetting
all the-the funky transitions,

23:48.680 --> 23:50.040
it's 2,000 miles thick.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.440
The core,

23:52.520 --> 23:54.840
the peach pit in the center...
that's a tricky one.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.160
There's two parts...

23:56.240 --> 23:57.640
the inner core
and the outer core.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.640
Are you following me?

23:58.720 --> 23:59.520
The inner core

23:59.600 --> 24:01.440
is, uh...

24:01.520 --> 24:03.400
well, it's a big, solid chunk
of iron,

24:03.520 --> 24:04.520
we think.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.920
And that's surrounded

24:06.000 --> 24:08.080
by the outer core,
and that is liquid.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.400
Yes, but,

24:09.480 --> 24:12.320
most importantly, this liquid
is constantly spinning

24:12.400 --> 24:13.400
in one direction.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.600
So a trillion trillion tons
of hot metal

24:16.680 --> 24:19.920
spinning at
a thousand miles an hour, so...

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Right, so Physics 101...

24:21.080 --> 24:23.440
hot metal moving fast
makes an electromagnetic field.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.000
This spinning liquid outer core
is the engine

24:26.080 --> 24:27.880
that drives the EM Field.

24:27.920 --> 24:31.040
And that's where
we have our problem.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.400
This engine has stalled.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.280
The core of the Earth
has stopped spinning.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.880
How could this have happened?

24:41.520 --> 24:42.280
We don't know.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.280
What's the timeline here?

24:47.360 --> 24:49.800
As the EM Field
becomes more and more unstable,

24:49.840 --> 24:51.800
we'll start seeing
isolated incidents.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.320
One plane
will fall from the sky,

24:53.360 --> 24:54.480
and then two, and then...

24:54.560 --> 24:55.920
in a few months, anything...

24:55.960 --> 24:57.760
everything electronic
will be fried.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.240
Static discharges
in the atmosphere

24:59.280 --> 25:01.120
will create "super-storms"
with hundreds

25:01.200 --> 25:02.640
of lightening strikes
per square mile.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.600
After that, it gets bad.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.160
The Earth's EM Field

25:08.240 --> 25:11.240
shields us from the solar winds,
which are a lethal blend

25:11.320 --> 25:15.080
of radioactive particles
and microwaves.

25:15.120 --> 25:18.440
When that shield collapses,
microwave radiation

25:18.480 --> 25:19.800
will literally

25:19.880 --> 25:22.760
cook our planet.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.360
Dr. Zimsky.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.040
This is the Sun.

25:27.120 --> 25:31.680
This is the Earth...
without the EM Field.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.480
Would you?

25:33.560 --> 25:34.760
Mm-hmm.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.040
Three months, gentlemen,
and we're back in the Stone Age.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.280
A full year,
the field collapses...

25:50.320 --> 25:51.600
and that.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.520
May I?

25:59.680 --> 26:01.400
Feel free to throw up.
I know I did.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.480
So, how do we fix it?

26:05.520 --> 26:06.360
We can't.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.400
Not in my vocabulary.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.800
Then you might want
to get one of those

26:08.880 --> 26:10.400
Word-A-Day calendars,
General, because

26:10.480 --> 26:11.360
it's impossible.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.440
The core is the size
of Mars.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.160
You're talking about
jump-starting a planet.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.000
This is a superheated
hyper-fluid

26:16.080 --> 26:18.640
of molten iron and nickel
at 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

26:18.720 --> 26:20.960
2,000 miles down,
1,000 miles thick.

26:21.040 --> 26:25.240
And the deepest we've ever been
is... seven miles

26:25.320 --> 26:26.800
with a two-inch drill bit.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.120
If we can go into space,
we certainly...

26:28.200 --> 26:29.080
Well, space is easy.

26:29.160 --> 26:29.880
It's empty.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.840
We're talking
about millions of pounds

26:31.920 --> 26:33.280
of pressure
per square inch.

26:33.360 --> 26:36.480
Even if we somehow
came up with a brilliant plan

26:36.560 --> 26:39.320
to fix the core,
we just can't get there.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.880
Yes, but...

26:46.400 --> 26:48.720
...what if we could?

27:38.480 --> 27:40.400
Hello, Braz.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.440
Why the hell
aren't you dead yet?

27:45.840 --> 27:47.040
Okay, this way.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.960
Well, that went better
than I expected.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.080
Dr. Brazzleton,

27:53.160 --> 27:54.360
I see you know Dr. Zimsky.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.440
Yeah.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.760
20 years ago,
he stole my research.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.720
After that,
we-we kind of lost touch.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.400
Research that
was equally mine.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.080
That's funny,
I don't remember a check

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
from any of the patents.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.880
All right, Braz.

28:06.960 --> 28:10.040
20 years in the desert makes
you a prophet and a martyr.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.520
Look, we're here
about your legendary ship.

28:12.560 --> 28:16.400
Okay, I'm combining
high-frequency pulse lasers

28:16.480 --> 28:18.160
with resonance tube ultrasonics.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.360
If you've ever seen
ultrasonic waves

28:20.400 --> 28:23.280
break up a kidney stone
on the Discovery Channel,

28:23.360 --> 28:24.400
it's the same deal here.

28:24.480 --> 28:28.040
You can...
put your helmets on now.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.360
Firing.

28:45.840 --> 28:48.280
Woo-ooh!

28:53.320 --> 28:54.600
Woo-hoo!

29:01.000 --> 29:03.280
Yeah. Oh.

29:15.960 --> 29:19.080
Okay, I'm officially impressed.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.360
So, all right.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.600
So you've made some progress

29:28.720 --> 29:31.240
with the engine,
we'll grant you.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.640
Have you begun to think
about a shell?

29:34.720 --> 29:37.320
Okay, this is Alex.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.720
Okay, Alex. Good.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.760
Okay, here we have
a concrete block,

29:42.800 --> 29:46.120
and in back of that,
we have a two-inch steel plate.

29:51.400 --> 29:52.520
Okay. We're ready.

29:57.080 --> 30:00.600
And we are... firing.

30:19.640 --> 30:20.680
Voila!

30:20.760 --> 30:23.120
That's...

30:23.160 --> 30:24.720
That's impossible.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.520
I combined the crystals

30:26.600 --> 30:29.760
in a tungsten-titanium matrix
at supercool temperatures,

30:29.840 --> 30:32.640
and that's what did the trick.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.000
The applications
for this are just...

30:35.080 --> 30:37.320
What do you call this material?

30:37.360 --> 30:39.680
Well, its real name
has 37 syllables.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.480
I call it Unobtainium.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.040
Unobtainium?

30:43.120 --> 30:44.400
Mm-hmm.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.000
The Unobtainium will take
the heat and the pressure

30:47.080 --> 30:48.440
and transform it to energy,

30:48.520 --> 30:51.400
which in turn, reinforces
the shell of the ship, you see.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.320
So the hotter
and the deeper she gets,

30:53.360 --> 30:55.480
the stronger she gets...
theoretically.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.960
Theoretically?

30:57.040 --> 30:58.600
Theoretically, yes.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.520
This... is Johnson,
don't mind him.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.000
This is the prototype
for the cockpit here.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.360
Excuse me,
Dr. Brazzleton,

31:06.440 --> 31:08.240
when do you think
the ship will be operational?

31:08.320 --> 31:11.680
When I get my fabrication
methods perfected...

31:11.760 --> 31:13.720
12... ten years, ten years.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.040
What would it take to get
it done in three months?

31:20.160 --> 31:22.760
$15 billion. I...

31:25.440 --> 31:27.080
Will you take a check?

31:28.760 --> 31:30.640
Why don't you use a credit card?
You get miles.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.760
Mm.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.920
Shit!

31:37.000 --> 31:40.120
Mr. Finch, this is the FBI.
We have a warrant.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.800
Purge!

31:48.720 --> 31:50.200
Come on, purge!

32:03.840 --> 32:05.040
FBI! Freeze!

32:14.800 --> 32:15.720
Okay.

32:15.760 --> 32:18.240
I know these
look like computers.

32:18.320 --> 32:21.600
Totally not.

32:21.680 --> 32:22.560
Theodore Donald Finch.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.840
Carnegie-Mellon University.
M.I.T.

32:23.920 --> 32:27.200
Worked at the Sun,
Lucent, Rand Corp.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.840
My handle's "Rat."
Call me Rat.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.320
63 computer fraud indictments.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.200
64.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.200
Two convictions.

32:34.280 --> 32:38.320
This is strike three, Mr. Finch.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.320
Wait a second.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.040
You guys aren't here
to whack me, are you?

32:41.120 --> 32:43.360
Because I was really,
really hoping to have sex

32:43.440 --> 32:44.440
before that happened.

32:46.480 --> 32:47.920
Yeah. I've been told
by the FBI...

32:48.000 --> 32:50.080
whose database you crippled
last year...

32:50.160 --> 32:52.160
that you are
the best in the business.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.240
So you're about
to be given a choice.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.320
What if I say no?

32:55.400 --> 32:57.560
Excuse me, but is this really

32:57.640 --> 32:59.160
the best we could do?

32:59.240 --> 33:00.360
I mean...

33:00.400 --> 33:01.240
How many languages do you speak?

33:01.320 --> 33:02.680
Five, actually.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.480
Well, I speak one.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.080
One, zero, one, zero, zero.

33:07.160 --> 33:11.720
With that, I could steal
your money, your secrets,

33:11.760 --> 33:14.080
your sexual fantasies,
your whole life,

33:14.160 --> 33:18.360
any country, any place,
anytime I want.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.800
We multitask
like you breathe.

33:19.880 --> 33:22.800
I couldn't think
as slow as you if I tried.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.920
Do you have any idea...?

33:26.960 --> 33:27.920
Okay, hey. Hey!

33:27.960 --> 33:31.160
Let's just, let's give
the kid a break.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.280
Okay, it's a phone.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.480
It's just a phone.

33:37.520 --> 33:43.640
Rat, we got a big problem.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.680
A lot of people
are going to die.

33:45.760 --> 33:46.840
We need your help.

33:46.920 --> 33:47.880
What kind of help?

33:47.920 --> 33:49.320
Information control.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.920
We need you to control the flow
of information on the Internet.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.880
You're dreaming.
Nobody controls the 'Net.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.080
Could you...
with unlimited resources?

33:57.200 --> 34:00.520
You want me to hack the planet?

34:02.520 --> 34:04.360
He wants me to hack the planet.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.880
You've got free long distance

34:10.960 --> 34:13.639
on that phone... forever.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.400
Okay.

34:16.480 --> 34:19.080
If I decide to do this...

34:19.159 --> 34:21.320
I'm going to need
an unlimited supply

34:21.360 --> 34:24.159
of Xena tapes and Hot Pockets.

34:24.239 --> 34:26.120
Hot Pockets?

34:26.199 --> 34:27.800
They help me concentrate.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.120
Sounds fair.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.360
Major Childs,
they're ready for you.

34:45.320 --> 34:46.400
Major Childs,

34:46.480 --> 34:48.800
a clarification:

34:48.880 --> 34:50.239
You and you alone
were responsible

34:50.320 --> 34:51.600
for proposing
the descent vectors

34:51.639 --> 34:52.600
for the shuttle, correct?

34:52.679 --> 34:53.920
Yes, General.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.840
We have determined that
the Class "A" landing mishap

34:56.880 --> 34:58.880
experienced by
the Shuttle <i>Endeavour</i>

34:58.960 --> 35:01.320
was caused by biased
navigational data

35:01.480 --> 35:05.120
from the ground due to a brief
geomagnetic disturbance.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.520
Major Childs,
the resourcefulness you showed

35:07.600 --> 35:09.760
in determining
the descent vectors proved

35:09.840 --> 35:12.840
that you have exceptional
navigation skills.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.920
You've brought much credit
upon yourself,

35:14.960 --> 35:17.400
the space program
and the United States Air Force.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.800
Congratulations, Major.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.760
You are reassigned

35:21.840 --> 35:24.200
with Commander Iverson
and Flight Director Stickley

35:24.240 --> 35:26.680
to a new mission
effective immediately.

35:26.760 --> 35:28.200
Transportation
is waiting outside.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.240
Good luck and Godspeed, Major.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.920
Are you sure you want
to wear this tie?

35:58.000 --> 35:58.880
Why?

35:58.960 --> 35:59.840
I don't know.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.360
I mean, you look so
nervous about it.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.440
You look so...

36:02.520 --> 36:04.640
So, how are you holding up?

36:04.760 --> 36:05.960
Oh, hi. I'm good, I'm good.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.880
I'm about to tell
a couple hundred people

36:07.920 --> 36:09.320
the world is going to end.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.280
Well...

36:10.320 --> 36:11.240
I've had better days.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.160
You look good.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.800
Well, no, you don't look good.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.720
Why did he touch his tie
like that?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.680
Thomas, let me speak
with you for a moment.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.520
Listen, wouldn't you
rather I did this?

36:20.560 --> 36:22.480
I mean, given my reputation,
I think that...

36:22.560 --> 36:24.520
No. No, Keyes is in
the lead here, Zimsky.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.480
Yes. Thomas, this is
the most important

36:26.520 --> 36:28.040
scientific operation
in history.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.760
And given my status, I feel that
it's my job to present...

36:30.800 --> 36:32.400
Project Destiny
was your job, Zimsky.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.440
And you went way beyond
authorized limits.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.240
And let me tell...
And let me tell you,

36:36.360 --> 36:40.520
I still, I want to know
if Destiny caused this problem.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.880
It's highly unlikely,
but it may be the solution.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.600
Now, I have not
finished checking...

36:44.680 --> 36:47.160
Excuse me.

36:47.240 --> 36:51.960
Rebecca...
I'm so glad I was wrong.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.240
Right over left...

36:53.320 --> 36:54.840
No, the other left,
the other left.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.120
- Gentlemen.
- And then you...

36:56.200 --> 36:57.360
Gentlemen.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.360
Commander Iverson,
Major Childs,

37:00.440 --> 37:02.640
this is your crew:

37:02.720 --> 37:04.440
Dr. Brazzleton knows the ship;

37:04.520 --> 37:05.560
Hello.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.680
Dr. Zimsky knows the planet;

37:06.760 --> 37:07.640
Doctor.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.520
Dr. Leveque knows
the weapons system;

37:09.560 --> 37:10.640
Excuse me, ladies first.

37:10.720 --> 37:11.680
Hi.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.480
And Dr. Keyes...

37:13.520 --> 37:15.600
Dr. Keyes built
the navigation system, so...

37:15.720 --> 37:16.720
Hi. Rebecca Childs.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.000
Bob Iverson.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.840
These are your fellow...
fellow... what?

37:21.880 --> 37:22.840
Terranauts?

37:22.920 --> 37:24.240
Hello.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.360
All this brain power over here

37:25.440 --> 37:27.320
is starting to smell
like burning batteries.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.840
Y'all better come and join in.

37:28.880 --> 37:29.920
Yeah.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.480
It's the simplest things
that are the hardest, huh?

37:33.520 --> 37:34.760
Yeah. It's official.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.480
I'm the least-qualified person
on this base.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.080
Dr. Keyes,
I'm sure the people in charge

37:39.160 --> 37:40.320
have every confidence in you.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.280
Well, the problem is that
I'm in charge.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.040
Yeah, I know.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.160
Can I help you?

37:45.200 --> 37:46.880
Yes, please.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.680
You're an astronaut,
and you can tie a Windsor?

37:50.760 --> 37:51.720
Mm-hmm.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.800
Is there anything you can't do?

37:53.840 --> 37:56.800
Not that I'm aware of.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.920
I find that
incredibly intimidating.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.920
Yep. Most people do.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.000
Here.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.080
Thank you.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.560
You're welcome.

38:09.440 --> 38:13.520
Let me introduce our project
leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.120
Thank you, thank you.

38:16.200 --> 38:19.680
Good evening. Good evening.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.080
Wow. This looks like a meeting

38:22.160 --> 38:24.760
for Nobel Prize Winners
Anonymous.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.720
I know you are all
the finest in your fields

38:27.760 --> 38:30.000
and have come a long way
to be here.

38:30.040 --> 38:34.280
So, I'll outline our program
over the next three months.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.480
Dr. Brazzleton will supervise
the building of a ship

38:40.560 --> 38:43.280
which is capable of reaching
the center of our planet.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.720
Once there, it will deliver
an explosive charge

38:45.800 --> 38:50.680
large enough
to restart its core.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.080
Dr. Zimsky will calculate

38:52.160 --> 38:54.000
the scale
of the explosion needed.

38:54.080 --> 38:57.800
This is a program I designed
to simulate the effect

38:57.840 --> 38:59.360
of nuclear detonations
on the core.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.960
If my calculations are correct,
a tiny nudge in any direction

39:02.040 --> 39:03.960
will force the core back
into its normal flow.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.760
What's a "tiny nudge"
in planetary terms?

39:05.840 --> 39:07.160
A thousand megatons,
give or take?

39:07.240 --> 39:08.680
Tops. Because any more than that

39:08.720 --> 39:11.160
would create
a core instability.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.960
We made a few monster warheads
in the 200-megaton range.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.840
Braz, do you think the ship
can handle five of these babies?

39:17.920 --> 39:20.440
Yeah. I can enlarge
the ejection pod...

39:20.520 --> 39:21.480
Forgive me,

39:21.520 --> 39:23.520
but, you know, I know
I'm not the expert here,

39:23.600 --> 39:25.480
but what if the core
is thicker or thinner?

39:25.520 --> 39:27.560
I mean, what if it's not
what you think it is?

39:27.600 --> 39:30.120
Isn't that going to affect
the way the explosions are...?

39:30.160 --> 39:31.600
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

39:31.680 --> 39:34.600
And what if the core
is made of cheese?

39:34.680 --> 39:37.320
This is all best
guess, Commander.

39:37.360 --> 39:40.240
That's all science is,
is best guess.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.240
So my best guess is
you don't know.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.440
With luck, irony will break
for the good guys for once,

39:44.520 --> 39:46.320
and the world's biggest weapons
of mass destruction

39:46.400 --> 39:48.840
will help save the world.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.320
The ship will be powered

39:50.400 --> 39:52.760
by a small experimental
nuclear reactor.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.960
It will be divided
into six compartments

39:55.040 --> 39:56.320
like cars on a train:

39:56.400 --> 39:58.440
The locomotive unit,
navigation compartment,

39:58.520 --> 40:01.520
living quarters, engineering,
bomb compartment

40:01.600 --> 40:03.920
and finally
the weapons-control module.

40:03.960 --> 40:07.520
Up to a 45 degree angle, every
compartment will be held level

40:07.600 --> 40:09.480
by these gyro control gimbals.

40:09.520 --> 40:12.120
But if we do breach a section,

40:12.200 --> 40:15.000
bulkhead doors engage
automatically,

40:15.120 --> 40:18.240
seal off the section in red,
and eject.

40:18.320 --> 40:20.560
Is ejection really
the best option?

40:20.640 --> 40:21.760
Only option.

40:21.840 --> 40:25.040
Each damaged compartment
degrades the entire hull.

40:25.080 --> 40:27.400
The objective is simple.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.360
The obstacles are gigantic.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.120
We're going to need
all the help in the world,

40:31.200 --> 40:32.920
but if we are to avoid
panic and chaos,

40:33.000 --> 40:37.000
the world at large can never
know what's happening here.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.200
Which is where our friend
Mr. Rat comes in.

40:39.280 --> 40:40.160
It's called Virus-bot.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.800
It's a computer virus
that will seek out files

40:41.920 --> 40:44.920
anywhere on the Web that contain
keywords that we designate

40:45.000 --> 40:45.960
and wipes them out.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
This is my Kung-Fu,
and it is strong.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.680
Meanwhile, there are
a million puzzles ahead of us,

40:53.760 --> 40:55.240
and we have three months
to solve them.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.000
We have a committed
and ingenious team.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.080
We have every resource available
to us,

40:59.120 --> 41:00.400
and we have the best

41:00.480 --> 41:03.200
of the world's scientific and
technical talents on our side.

41:03.280 --> 41:07.440
With your help we can,
we must... succeed.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.800
Feedback in the resonance tube.

41:12.880 --> 41:13.480
Talk to me, gentlemen.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.440
We are losing

41:14.480 --> 41:15.400
structural integrity.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.520
No, it's not feedback.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.160
It's an impeller malfunction,
I believe.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.760
No, it's not, no. If it were
an impeller malfunction...

41:19.840 --> 41:21.880
For God's sakes, Braz,
make the call!

41:21.960 --> 41:23.720
No, I'll make the call.
I should make the call.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.520
65 knots.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.400
Depth, 8-5 thousand feet.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.200
Look, guys...

41:30.960 --> 41:33.320
It's a disaster!

41:37.120 --> 41:41.120
What part of "talk to me"
don't you guys understand?

41:41.200 --> 41:42.920
For the 22nd time in a row,

41:42.960 --> 41:44.560
everyone on Earth is dead.

41:44.640 --> 41:47.440
Let's take a little quiet time,

41:47.480 --> 41:49.360
and you all are going
to try this again.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.160
Hi.

41:56.480 --> 41:57.480
Hi.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.440
What is this?

41:59.520 --> 42:03.920
Well, it's...
I invented it.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.680
It's how you're going to...
going to steer underground.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.160
It's, um...

42:08.280 --> 42:09.880
not very good reception.

42:09.960 --> 42:12.280
Well, you're looking

42:12.360 --> 42:15.400
through three feet of lead
at 50 yards away, so...

42:15.440 --> 42:16.680
it ain't bad.

42:16.720 --> 42:20.040
It's like a CAT scan
at a hospital,

42:20.120 --> 42:22.480
but it's-it's souped-up.

42:22.640 --> 42:23.880
I invented it

42:23.920 --> 42:25.000
for Deep Earth surveying.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.400
And then the government came in,
bought my research,

42:27.440 --> 42:29.960
paid off my student loan guys
and made me a consultant.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.720
I'm sorry,
this is really delicate.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.600
And I have it
just the way I want it.

42:33.680 --> 42:36.480
So... excuse me.

42:36.560 --> 42:37.840
Uh, yeah.

42:37.920 --> 42:40.320
Then they brought me in
when the pacemakers quit,

42:40.400 --> 42:43.400
and... boom...
you know, I'm Apocalypse Boy.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.760
Apocalypse Boy?

42:45.840 --> 42:49.360
Yeah. I'm having T-shirts
made up.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.400
Well, hats sell better.

42:51.440 --> 42:54.040
You know, it's funny,
because that is...

42:54.120 --> 42:55.640
right where it should be.

42:55.720 --> 42:56.600
Well...

42:56.680 --> 42:58.480
I'm sorry. I'm a little
ragged around the edges.

42:58.520 --> 43:00.560
I'm just trying to get
this thing to focus correctly.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.080
This is really cool,
but can I just...?

43:02.160 --> 43:04.040
Well... mm-hmm.

43:13.480 --> 43:17.320
It's better.
It's better. Uh...

43:43.280 --> 43:45.640
God, I hate this sky.

44:26.400 --> 44:29.200
Crashing one ship
isn't enough for you?

44:29.240 --> 44:30.880
Hey. Practice makes perfect.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.440
You can practice all you like.

44:32.520 --> 44:35.000
It doesn't mean you're ready
to sit in that seat.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.720
So you keep reminding me, sir.

44:37.800 --> 44:38.680
You know, I doubt

44:38.760 --> 44:40.080
you're even going
to listen to this,

44:40.160 --> 44:41.640
but I'm going to give it a shot.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.640
Being a leader
isn't about ability.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.520
It's about responsibility.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.000
Got it, sir.

44:50.080 --> 44:51.160
No, you don't, Beck.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.720
I mean,
you're not just responsible

44:52.800 --> 44:53.880
for making good decisions.

44:53.960 --> 44:56.280
You have to be responsible
for the bad ones.

44:56.360 --> 44:59.960
You got to be ready
to make the shitty call.

45:00.040 --> 45:00.880
What makes you think
I'm not?

45:00.960 --> 45:02.200
Because you're so good.

45:02.280 --> 45:05.600
You haven't hit anything
you couldn't beat.

45:05.680 --> 45:06.680
I mean, hell,

45:06.760 --> 45:09.320
you were the one who figured out
how to save the shuttle.

45:09.480 --> 45:12.360
You made me, you made the rest
of NASA just look like an ass.

45:12.400 --> 45:16.360
It's just that
you're used to winning...

45:18.760 --> 45:21.720
...and you're not really
a leader until you've lost.

45:24.800 --> 45:28.200
$20 billion has been spent
developing this system...

45:28.240 --> 45:30.240
Oh, come on, guys,
the chefs at NASA...

45:33.200 --> 45:34.280
I want wine!
I need wine!

45:34.440 --> 45:36.960
It's about nutrition.
In five days, I think...

45:37.040 --> 45:39.160
Whoa!

45:40.880 --> 45:43.120
That's high-level
static discharge.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.920
I think we should
check this out.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.520
This doesn't look so good.

45:56.880 --> 45:58.800
It's a lightning superstorm.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.520
Popping up all over the world.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.840
Got 'em. Tracking.

46:04.360 --> 46:07.880
Uh-oh. Rome does not look good.

47:54.600 --> 47:56.720
This planet is decaying faster
than we thought.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.000
It's just the start.

47:58.080 --> 47:59.920
Soon they'll be EM spikes

48:00.000 --> 48:02.120
and microwaves will break
through the weak spots and...

48:02.200 --> 48:05.320
All right. Get this ship
in the ground. Now.

48:34.640 --> 48:37.960
Ah! Summer in the Pacific.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.680
Yeah, the world is inside out.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.400
I was saving this for later,
but...

49:03.440 --> 49:05.120
this is the time for...

49:06.840 --> 49:08.000
Josh, do you mind?

49:08.080 --> 49:09.160
No, not at all. Yeah.

49:10.600 --> 49:11.760
We should have a name
for this baby.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.760
Oh, she's called <i>Virgil,</i>
actually.

49:13.840 --> 49:16.040
Virgil... the poet that led
our man into the depths of hell?

49:16.080 --> 49:17.160
That's it.

49:17.200 --> 49:18.280
That's appropriate, I guess.

49:18.320 --> 49:19.400
Well, here's to <i>Virgil.</i>

49:19.480 --> 49:22.080
To the planet.

49:22.160 --> 49:23.080
- To <i>Virgil.</i>
- To <i>Virgil.</i>

49:30.040 --> 49:32.960
No flashbulbs, no press,
nobody cheering.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.320
It's... weird.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.120
Let's go.

49:54.080 --> 49:57.040
Cabin pressure, TSI, 3.5.

49:57.120 --> 49:58.560
Check.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.840
ECS cabin repress open.

50:00.880 --> 50:03.560
And repress VLV closed.

50:03.640 --> 50:04.920
Check.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.120
Fluid dump valve.

50:06.200 --> 50:07.760
We are about to begin
our journey

50:07.840 --> 50:09.560
into the heart of the cosmos,

50:09.640 --> 50:11.640
into the very core
of our own planet.

50:11.720 --> 50:12.920
Close.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.920
- Where we find therein...
- Check.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.360
The secrets of the universe...

50:17.400 --> 50:18.560
...3.5 PSI.

50:18.640 --> 50:20.320
...the mysteries of time...

50:20.400 --> 50:22.320
LM circuit lockup.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.400
- Check.
...hope for the future.

50:24.480 --> 50:25.360
And signal.

50:25.440 --> 50:26.800
Deep Earth Control,
this is <i>Virgil.</i>

50:26.880 --> 50:28.240
Signal check.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.040
This is Deep Earth Control.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.400
I have thumbs-up
across the board.

50:32.480 --> 50:34.800
You are clear
to initiate power-up.

50:43.400 --> 50:45.480
Reactor power confirmed.

50:45.560 --> 50:49.600
At 1,000 rpm, we will countdown
to launch. On your mark.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.400
Pad leader, stand by for launch.

50:53.760 --> 50:54.760
All right, <i>Virgil.</i>

50:56.880 --> 50:57.640
Mark.

50:57.720 --> 51:00.680
Gantry count. Ten, nine,

51:00.720 --> 51:05.480
eight, seven, six, five, four,

51:05.560 --> 51:07.920
three, two, one...

51:07.960 --> 51:09.960
launch.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.880
500 feet.

51:42.960 --> 51:44.680
Leveling out.

51:55.400 --> 51:58.920
Okay, guys,
let's swing forward.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.000
800 feet.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.800
Light 'em up, Beck.

52:12.120 --> 52:13.440
Gyro leveling operational.

52:13.520 --> 52:15.200
Hull integrity holding.

52:44.960 --> 52:47.480
I'm going to keep her nose
down about 15 degrees and...

52:48.800 --> 52:51.400
Oh, my goodness.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.840
They're singing to us.

53:13.880 --> 53:16.480
<i>Virgil's</i> resonance tubes
are powered up,

53:16.560 --> 53:17.920
so they're vibrating
sub sonically.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.920
Actually, we're singing to them.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.000
What's our depth?

53:34.080 --> 53:36.560
1,600 feet,
plenty of room on both sides.

53:36.640 --> 53:37.640
Hull integrity is good.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.040
You sure?

53:39.120 --> 53:40.040
Let's increase impeller speed.

53:40.080 --> 53:41.800
I think we'll be needing
additional control.

53:45.400 --> 53:46.960
Stick, I'm getting
a seismic reading.

53:47.040 --> 53:47.960
What's happening?

53:48.040 --> 53:50.920
T-phase.
Underwater earthquake.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.480
Still think the water-launch
was a good idea?

53:58.560 --> 54:01.400
Yes, yes, I chose this location
because the crust is thin here.

54:01.480 --> 54:03.960
The downside is... there's lots
of seismic activity.

54:04.040 --> 54:05.120
4,000 feet.

54:07.800 --> 54:09.040
You see that rock?

54:09.120 --> 54:10.280
That is not good.

54:17.720 --> 54:18.760
We're losing steering here.

54:18.840 --> 54:20.200
There's some kind
of crosscurrent.

54:22.160 --> 54:23.280
14,000 feet.

54:36.560 --> 54:39.080
Okay, guys, fasten
your seat belts.

54:39.120 --> 54:40.840
We're turning into the skid.

54:50.640 --> 54:53.000
18,000.

54:53.080 --> 54:54.640
18,500.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.160
They're going way too fast.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.240
21,000 feet.

55:11.320 --> 55:12.240
We hit the wall,

55:12.280 --> 55:13.280
we're rabbits on the highway.

55:13.360 --> 55:14.760
Pressure, pressure,
pressure, pressure.

55:14.800 --> 55:16.040
What do you mean, pressure?

55:16.120 --> 55:17.560
I thought you said this
thing was indestructible!

55:17.640 --> 55:18.680
I said the pressure
makes us stronger.

55:18.760 --> 55:19.800
We just don't have
enough of it yet.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.480
We're at 25,000 feet.
Pull out, sir.

55:23.560 --> 55:24.440
Can't.

55:24.520 --> 55:25.840
- What?
- We're locked in.

55:25.920 --> 55:28.440
Go to full throttle.

55:28.520 --> 55:32.360
Standby to engage front
and lateral lasers, please.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.600
But what if we hit bottom
in ten seconds here?

55:34.640 --> 55:36.360
Just give it
a couple more seconds.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.640
The lasers will fire.

55:41.680 --> 55:42.880
No, there's not enough time
for power-up.

55:47.200 --> 55:48.600
27,000 feet.

55:48.680 --> 55:50.280
The lasers will deploy.

55:53.040 --> 55:54.200
29,000 feet.

55:54.280 --> 55:55.880
- Do it!
- And...

55:57.360 --> 55:58.720
Do it! Now.

56:42.160 --> 56:45.000
And we've got a signal.

56:45.080 --> 56:46.200
- All right.
- Yeah!

56:51.520 --> 56:53.000
All right.

56:55.440 --> 56:57.120
Switching on electron spin burst
transmitters.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.480
Plotting through
lowest density material,

56:59.560 --> 57:01.040
reconfiguring
every five minutes.

57:01.120 --> 57:04.560
Hull integrity 100%.
Reactor power 100%.

57:04.640 --> 57:05.640
All green
on the bomb compartment.

57:05.720 --> 57:07.400
Speed is 60 knots.

57:07.480 --> 57:09.560
Hot damn.

57:09.640 --> 57:12.120
All right, we'll be through
the crust in 15 minutes

57:12.200 --> 57:13.240
and into the mantle.

57:13.320 --> 57:15.320
24 hours to the core, and
then assuming we survive...

57:15.400 --> 57:17.560
Assuming?
Yes, assuming.

57:17.640 --> 57:20.720
Another 15 hours to the
inner core-outer core border.

57:20.800 --> 57:23.120
They're doing well.

57:23.200 --> 57:24.840
The crust is just rock.

57:24.880 --> 57:27.080
Now it gets interesting.

57:27.160 --> 57:28.560
<i>Virgil,</i> can we get
a status check?

57:28.640 --> 57:30.720
We're about to make
the transition into the mantle.

58:00.040 --> 58:00.960
Come on, come on.

58:14.160 --> 58:17.960
Well, exterior pressure
is 800,000 pounds

58:18.040 --> 58:19.440
per square inch.

58:19.520 --> 58:21.240
And hull integrity is 100%.

58:21.320 --> 58:24.880
It is as if we we're diving
through the memories

58:24.960 --> 58:26.000
of the planet.

58:26.080 --> 58:28.200
But we are about to pass
from memory

58:28.280 --> 58:30.080
into madness.

58:30.160 --> 58:33.800
Are you going to be doing
that Carl Sagan narration

58:33.840 --> 58:34.920
all the way to the core?

58:34.960 --> 58:37.360
- I beg your pardon?
- I said...

58:37.400 --> 58:39.520
I-I have an obligation to
my students, to my readers...

58:39.600 --> 58:41.080
An obligation to make
a book deal perhaps?

58:41.160 --> 58:42.640
Two book deals,
if you'd like to know the truth.

58:42.720 --> 58:45.240
I read that last book.
It wasn't very good.

58:45.320 --> 58:46.240
Oh, really? Really?

58:46.320 --> 58:47.560
When did you learn how to read?

59:06.840 --> 59:08.040
People.

59:08.120 --> 59:10.320
Drs. Zimsky and Keyes?

59:13.760 --> 59:16.240
You guys are
our resident geophysicists.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.680
What do you make of this?

59:17.760 --> 59:19.120
The mantle
is a chemical hodgepodge

59:19.200 --> 59:21.480
of... a variety of elements...

59:21.520 --> 59:25.840
Say it with me:
"I don't know."

59:25.920 --> 59:27.440
Well, Commander,

59:27.520 --> 59:30.000
wise men say, "When in doubt,
you should go around."

59:30.080 --> 59:30.680
No. It's too big.

59:30.760 --> 59:32.040
We turn too slow.

59:32.080 --> 59:34.600
Anything that
we can't go through

59:34.640 --> 59:35.680
displays as black.

59:35.760 --> 59:36.920
So what's... what's static?

59:37.000 --> 59:39.240
It's nothing.

59:39.280 --> 59:40.640
What do you mean?

59:40.720 --> 59:43.480
It's nothing.

59:43.560 --> 59:46.280
It's empty space.

59:47.160 --> 59:48.840
I...

59:50.360 --> 59:52.200
I never taught the computer
how to read empty space.

59:52.280 --> 59:53.480
And I never taught <i>Virgil</i>
how to fly.

59:54.800 --> 59:55.560
Oh, God!

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.200
Oh, no, man!

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.320
Oh, dear God.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.200
Serge, you all right?

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.880
Yeah.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.760
Anybody hurt?

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.960
No. You okay?

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:37.920
Yeah.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.480
What's that?
What is that?

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.000
From the cooling system.
Shut that down.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.880
Shut it down.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.760
I told you to go around her.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.240
Nobody listens to me.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.360
Where in God's name are we?

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.280
Whatever has us jammed up
is inside our lasers.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.280
Shut 'em down.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.360
We're not going anywhere.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.120
Powering down.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.200
Josh, is there any other image
you can pull up?

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.200
Nope.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.680
Whatever it is, it's also inside
our MRI cameras.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.440
We have to go outside.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.400
What?

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.680
Believe me,
I hate to admit it,

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.800
but I think he's right.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.320
I'm coming.
I want to collect samples.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.600
Wait, hang on, hang on.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.000
Wait, wait,
the first problem is,

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.240
the only way out of the ship...
is the way we came in,

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.720
which is through
the impeller outlet...

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.800
Which is still
at 5,000 degrees.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.320
Exactly, I mean...

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.640
I'll just flush it
with liquid nitrogen

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.760
from the cooling system.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.960
Wait. The cooling system

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.560
that's keeping us from
roasting to death in this ship?

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.000
Well, just a small part of it.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.800
Alternatives?

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.560
Anybody.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.840
Whoa, whoa, that's it.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.360
It's like a giant...
giant crystal.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.720
Where the hell are we?

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.240
Well, the good news is,

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.160
it looks like the suits
can take the pressure.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.000
It's completely jammed
the laser assembly.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.280
We just...
we got to hope,

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.440
if we can cut it loose,

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.600
- they're still functional.
- Careful!

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.440
Okay.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.520
Got it.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.760
Beck, try the lights, will you?

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.000
Lighting up.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.040
Oh, it's magnificent.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.480
Oh, my God.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.560
Aladdin's cave.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.000
It's like
a crystal Grand Canyon.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.560
I think it's a geode.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.000
But I don't understand

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.480
how it could have survived
down here.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.840
Cobalt shell, maybe?

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.960
No. I-I mean,

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.360
in a magma environment
of 5,000 degrees.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.440
Something would have
to protect it.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.520
Unbelievable.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.480
Zimsky.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.760
Yeah?

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.000
We're inside
a giant gem bubble,

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.600
wrapped in a cobalt cocoon

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.400
700 miles below the surface
of the Earth.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.400
Hell of a day.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.800
Yes, it is.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.880
I'll start cutting.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.080
Okay, Braz.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.040
I'm going to check the hull.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.160
Call me if you need me.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.680
Okay.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.280
Oh, no.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.120
- Zimsky!
- Yeah?

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.320
Zimsky, look!

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.880
It's an amethyst.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.480
Oh, God,

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.400
we've breached the shell.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.320
Guys, you don't have to be here!

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.920
I want you back inside!

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.760
Well, I think that means me.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.240
Orders are orders.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.880
Wait, Josh.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.520
The problem is
I'm losing oxygen.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.280
Braz, what can I do?

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.800
Check the feeds for me.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.120
Check the feeds for me, Josh.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:32.600
Quick!

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.840
I'm coming. I'm coming
as fast as I can.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.000
Hey, guys, at this rate

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.840
we have three minutes
before the lava gets to us.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.880
Come on, guys.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.160
Come on.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.440
It's not going to work
without oxygen!

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.440
We're losing oxygen!

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.280
I fixed it. Now cut!

01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.880
That's good. It's working now.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.200
It's working well now!

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.920
That's good, Josh!

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.760
Josh's vital signs are dropping.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.560
What?

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.600
Serge!

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.360
You're almost there.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.600
You're almost there, Josh.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.760
Josh!

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.040
Joshua!

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.200
Okay, guys,

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.240
connect the oxygen.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.320
Braz, you got that?

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.360
Yes. Connected!

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.440
Good. I got to check
these lasers.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.920
Okay, Beck, turn 'em over.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.480
Pre-lasers only,
if you don't mind.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.640
Initiating.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.200
This better work.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.800
The tide's really coming in.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.440
Yes!

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.560
We got lucky...
I think we're going

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.920
to swim right out of this one.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.120
Bob?

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.280
Huh?

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.760
Bob?

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.680
Bob...

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.920
Braz, come on, it's over.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.120
Okay. Okay.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.200
Beck! Beck!

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.800
We're coming in.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.200
Initiate start sequence.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.720
Beck!

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.360
- Beck, do you hear me?
- Careful.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.320
Start the impellers!

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.160
The door, open the door.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.800
Activate bulkhead doors!

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.120
Now, Beck!

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:04.680
You okay?
You're going to be weak.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.640
You're okay.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.200
Good job, good job.
Good man.

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.439
Well done, well done.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.600
I'm fine. Thank you.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:10.560
So, um...

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.920
we have some good news,
and, uh...

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.200
and we have some bad news.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:17.640
Uh, good news.
I'll take good news.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.600
All right.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.960
Well, we're alive
and we're moving.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.160
That's g... that's good news.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.439
Oh, it is hot in here.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.279
Yeah, that nitro we flushed out

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:29.000
of the cooling system,
it-it's causing things

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:29.960
just to heat up a little.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:30.760
I'm going to go back

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:31.880
and just make
some adjustments.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.439
I'll lend you a hand.

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.800
All right.
I'm fine.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.160
I'm going to check
your heartbeat, okay?

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.479
Thanks, Braz. Appreciate it.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.479
So, that's the bad news?

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.439
That's not too bad.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.880
No.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.240
Commander Iverson died.

01:09:47.319 --> 01:09:49.200
But...

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:51.800
we're living,
and he would want to...

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.240
he'd want us to complete
our mission,

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:57.400
so I think that it's important
that we all...

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.600
It's all right.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.920
Thank you.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.120
I'm sorry.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.000
Let's give him a second, okay?

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.000
He deserves that.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.440
Oh, God, this all just seems
too big, doesn't it?

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.000
I think you were attempting
the impossible.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.120
You were trying
to save the world, and...

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.600
it's overwhelming.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.040
I came here to save my wife
and my two children

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.200
and... six billion lives...
it's too much.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.160
I just hope
I'm-I'm smart enough

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.160
and brave enough to save three.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.680
You did a nice job, Joshua.
Very nice. Great.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.400
You'd have done the same thing.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.480
Well, maybe, maybe.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.080
Hey... who's steering
the ship?

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.640
Video screen autopilot.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.160
I hope he knows the way.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:12.120
You and me both.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.640
So... you're really
a college professor?

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.840
You're not from the CIA,

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.720
or the NSA or any
of those three-letter places?

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.360
No. I am a boring
college professor.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:29.240
Wrong place, wrong place.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.920
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.360
Well, I just, I just...

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.800
Listen, the lack of oxygen

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.200
kept me from weeping
like a little girl

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.720
as is my custom
in dangerous situations.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:53.360
Hey, guys, we're close
to the mantle core interface.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.440
Where are you?

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:57.120
Key's in, Dr. Brazzleton.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.400
Ready.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.520
We are in the...

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.040
Okay, the code...
0-1-3-1-9-9-5.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.720
...luxurious, beautiful
weapons control...

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.640
checking the controls
on the nukes.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.000
This is the birthday
of my daughter.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.520
0-1-3-1-9-9-5.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.920
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.160
Three, two and one...

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.360
Thank you.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.480
Green. All green.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.520
Great. So we have
to synchronize

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.880
the babies now.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.080
Just a second.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.760
There.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.960
All right,
now let's put them to bed.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.240
Zimsky, could you please
come up here for a second?

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.520
Yes?

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.920
We're not supposed to go through
anything black.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.080
Yes, so please don't.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.120
What is this?

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.120
They're scattered everywhere.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.200
Oh, my God!
They're diamonds!

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.520
Great.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.600
You might want to sit down
and buckle up.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.360
We're on a collision course
here.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.560
All rightie. Careful.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.760
Guys, we're dodging diamonds
the size of Cape Cod,

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.440
so bear with me.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.240
Not exactly nimble here.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.680
Diamonds? I want some.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.680
Can I help?

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.240
Ooh!

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.160
Okay.
It's okay.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.520
Okay, it looks like
we're in the clear.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.560
Breach!

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.160
Guys! Weapons control, get out!

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.320
Get out now!

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.160
Serge!

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.520
Serge! What the hell
are you doing?

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.120
Come on!

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.600
My notebook!

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.720
Now!

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.640
Serge!

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.480
Take the time reg, Joshua!

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.040
Come on Serge! Come on!

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.880
My notes!
You'll need them!

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:37.840
No!

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.040
God, no, Serge!

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.320
It's okay.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.160
Serge, come on! No!

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.120
Serge!

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.360
Come on, man!

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.120
- Leave the box!
- We need the box!

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.840
We can get him!
We can get him out!

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.880
Hold on, Serge!

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.000
Beck! Beck!

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.560
Override the ejection system!

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.480
Beck, no!
One damaged compartment

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.680
threatens the whole ship!

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.800
Beck! Beck!

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.680
Override the ejection system!

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:28.160
Serge, we're right here.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.840
We're not going
to forget about you, man.

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.200
- Josh, can you hear me?
- Serge! Serge...

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.680
Hey, buddy,
look in your monitor right now.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.680
Serge, look in your monitor.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.520
I'm right here. Serge...

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.520
Josh, I can't see you.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.920
Braz is going to override
the doors manually, okay?

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.080
We're working on it right now.
Braz, how long?

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.640
Going as fast as I can,
Fast as I can.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.760
- Okay, I'm scared.
- We're going right now.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.120
Shouldn't be two seconds,
all right?

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.120
Josh!

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.840
Beck, override
the ejection systems, okay?

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.360
Damn. I don't think
Beck can hear me.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.360
Serge, look at me now. Serge!

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.040
Serge, we're right here, okay?

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.680
We're not going
to forget about you, man.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.080
I'm going to get you
out of here.

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.400
We're working on it, all right?

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.320
Stay with me here.
Okay?

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.800
I don't know what to do.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.160
Can you hear me now?
All right, here I am.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.240
I'm not going
to let you go, man.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.680
I'm not going to let you go,
all right?

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.920
Stay with me here, okay?

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.200
I'm going to come to Paris

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.200
and we'll go out, all right?
After this.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.760
After this is all
said and done, all right?

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.560
- Josh!
- Serge!

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.760
Serge! Serge!

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.200
Serge!

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.280
Serge!

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.920
Did you reset the overrides?

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.880
I never pushed them.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.280
You let him die.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.120
Actually,
you really want to know?

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.600
I killed him twice.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:36.640
First when I hit the diamond,

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.120
and then when I didn't hit
the override.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.560
Do you want me to feel any worse
about that than I already do?

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.600
It's not possible.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.920
Why are you being
so smug about that?

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.360
Could you have made
the decision?

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.320
- Yes.
- Could you?

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.360
Yes, I could've.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.720
If you would've hit
that switch,

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.120
I could've got him outta there!

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.160
I was yelling for you!

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.840
Take it and look at it!

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.400
I was two inches from him!

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.000
I was two inches,

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.560
and I told you
to put the door up

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.520
and you didn't!

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.880
I was screaming for you!

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.320
Why didn't you do it?!

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.240
Because I had to make
that decision.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.920
Fate or God...

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.920
No!

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.760
Damn it!
You leave God out of this!

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.000
Serge died so that we could
complete our job.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.480
Oh, that's right,
the job of saving the world.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:21.800
Not the whole world, Josh!
Just three of them.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.080
<i>Virgil,</i> you are approaching
core interface.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.280
Are you good to go?

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.520
Josh?

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.720
Josh, can you hear me?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.160
Josh, can you hear me?

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.000
Ready as we'll ever be, Stick.

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.640
Dr. Keyes.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.560
Right here.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.360
Deep Earth,
we are green and good to go.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.080
We just got a huge speed jump.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:18.960
We just got a huge speed jump.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.000
We're at 95 knots.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.120
110.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.680
130... 140.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.240
Our speed's jumped
because the density of the core

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.720
is different than our estimates.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.440
It's lighter
than we thought.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.480
So much for best guesses.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.480
I'm fine with this.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:33.480
At this rate, we'll, what...

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.320
hit the inner core
in a little over five hours.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.680
I think we finally

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:37.640
bought some luck.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:38.600
Braz.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.600
- Yeah.
- Would you please

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.280
punch the new core density
into the equations

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.360
for the nuclear detonation?

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:49.960
Please tell me this is enough.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.040
Okay.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.560
You're telling me

01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.400
the 1,000 megatons
of nuclear warheads

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.240
we hauled down here
isn't going to cut it?

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.640
No. This core material
is too thin.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.120
- What?
- The energy waves from

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.200
the explosion
won't spread far enough.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.640
They'll just bleed
away into nothing.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.240
That's it.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.640
We go home.
We go home.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.560
- Home?
- What?

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.160
Our Commander is dead.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.720
Our weapons specialist is dead.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.520
Our weapons control systems
are gone.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.080
We don't know whether
we can arm the nuclear devices,

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.600
and our plan to fix the core
no longer works. So...

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.600
we have failed.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:31.760
We have not failed.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.880
We have failed, and we go home,

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.320
and we go to the alternative.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.160
What alternative?

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.600
What are you talking about?

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.560
General,
this is Dr. Conrad Zimsky.

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.520
Destiny is a go.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.480
Repeat.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.280
Destiny is a go.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.440
Damn.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.880
I need to know everything
to do my job.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.160
You don't have to know this.

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.640
General, it is my job

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.320
to ensure the safety
of this mission.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.640
Anything that affects
it is my business.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.400
Now what the hell is Destiny?

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.320
It's a device.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:10.720
Deep Earth Seismic Trigger
Initiative, DEST-INI. Destiny.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.520
We had reason to believe

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.720
that our enemies were
building a weapon

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.200
that could generate
targeted seismic events.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.720
They would be able
to create massive earthquakes

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.680
under our territory.

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.000
No way of telling who did it.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.160
So?

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.960
So... we built one, too.

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.800
M.A.D.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.360
Mutually Assured Destruction.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.480
A perfect acronym
if ever there was one.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.080
Beautiful.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.040
They built it first.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.000
I built it better.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.360
I beamed high-powered

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.040
electromagnetic
energy waves down Deep Earth

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.520
fault lines, and, you know.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.280
Zimsky, what makes you think

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.560
that Destiny
would even touch the core?

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.120
'Cause it already did.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.680
This isn't a fluke.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.720
We killed the planet.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.520
You keep saying
that the core is too big

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.440
to be affected by anything
short of nukes.

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.520
- So...
- The core is an engine.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.240
Throw a small wrench
into a big engine,

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.320
you can still stall it.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.880
Deep Earth, this is <i>Virgil.</i>

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:07.360
We require clarification on
the status of Project Destiny.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.960
Why weren't
we notified of this, sir?

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.920
Because you didn't need to know,
Major.

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:13.640
Now you may not like this.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.920
I may not like it either.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
But it's my job,
and I do it for my country,

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.840
and if we don't develop these
devices, someone worse will

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.480
and they will
use them against us.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.080
But you have my word.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.960
No one in this
administration... no one,

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.360
had any idea
that this could happen.

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.920
So the device that killed the
planet is your backup plan?

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.440
An electric shock
can stop a heart.

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.600
It can certainly restart one.

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.000
Destiny will work.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.280
It has to.

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.240
No, it won't work.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.400
If you fire that thing again

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:43.120
with the core already stalled,
it'll terminally destabilize it.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.160
Yes, granted... there is
a marginal risk involved,

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.400
but given the circumstances,

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.920
I hardly see that there's
an alternative.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:48.880
No, Zimsky, listen to me.

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.400
Every volcano
on the planet will blow.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.960
There'll be earthquakes big
enough to rip us to pieces.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:53.920
- Dr. Keyes.
- What?

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.680
I'm afraid it's all we've got.

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.880
Now, I have orders
from the president.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:58.960
Come home, <i>Virgil.</i>

01:23:59.040 --> 01:23:59.920
We go to plan B.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:00.960
Well, what about plan C?

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.560
What? What?

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:03.680
Well, plan C.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.200
We continue on.

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.240
We restart the core...
somehow.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.840
We don't do it,
you fire Destiny.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.240
I can't wait for you
to get out of there.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.080
Then don't.
We fail, fire Destiny.

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.400
Oh, come on! That's ridiculous!

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.080
What choice do we have,

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.160
- Zimsky?
- Are you kidding me?

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.320
If they set that thing off,

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.720
the shock waves
will wipe us out!

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.920
We'll be lucky to get back
if we turn back right now!

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.840
<i>Virgil,</i> I'm telling you
right now, we will fire Destiny,

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.880
and we need to do so
as quickly as possible,

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.320
and if you're still there,

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.320
you will be destroyed.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.080
Rebecca?

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.280
Please don't make me
have to do this.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.960
Plan C.

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.880
It's your call, Commander.

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.840
Majority decision.

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.400
We're going in.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.680
I'm sorry, sir.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:02.120
Oh, come on, you're
a bunch of suicidal morons!

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.280
What are you, crazy?

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.280
Plan C?
Restart the core "somehow"?

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.280
Oh, that's a great idea!

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.320
That's a brilliant idea!

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:08.480
I can't believe I'm stuck

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.480
in this floating septic tank
with you lunatics!

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.920
You may have nothing to lose.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:12.880
You may have nothing to lose!

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.840
You may have nothing to lose

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:14.800
but I have my life to lose,

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.000
thank you very much
while you're up!

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.000
Now turn it around!

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.560
He told us to go back
and we're going back!

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.520
Why? You want to be a hero?
You want to be a martyr?

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.360
What do you want to be?
You're out of your mind!

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.080
Thank you!
Turn it around!

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.200
- No!
- Zimsky.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.760
You, shut up!

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.840
It's not a stupid ship.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:41.880
I had to.

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.440
It had to happen sometime.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.400
Yeah.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.520
Oh...

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.560
Status! What is that?

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.280
It's the EM
monitoring station.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.240
It's the one that

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.320
tracks EM pulses.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.760
God, no.

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.800
Just talk, Mr. Rat.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:07.760
No.

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.280
That's a good boy.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.840
Remember those
invisible microwaves

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.920
that Josh was talking about?

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.080
Well, they just found a hole.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.840
No, it's a parking lot
out here...

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.040
Oh, my God.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.640
And now with this

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.080
horrific breaking news,

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.640
we go live to San Francisco,
where Leo Jacks has the story.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.680
Yes, Claire,
it's hard to believe

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.080
that half of San Francisco
is in ruins today

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.320
following the most devastating
and the most baffling

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.800
event in our nation's history.

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.680
It's-it's
a horrific situation here.

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760
Thousands are dead.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.880
Many are missing.

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.760
It's-it's hotels, hospitals.

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.000
Bring up the power grid.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:13.080
The whole West Coast is out.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.240
That means we're going to have
to suck up just about every drop

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.600
of juice east of the Rockies

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:19.880
to fire Destiny.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:23.560
Another EM spike, we're not
going to have enough power.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:27.200
General, you have got
to give them more time.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.480
There is no more time.

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.760
Colonel, call Destiny.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.200
I am launching
a formal complaint

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.640
against you
with the Department of Defense.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:34.600
Rat to Josh.

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.720
Go, Rat.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.840
Hey, um...

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.840
here's the EM Field data
that you're primed for.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.240
Digging that, Rat.

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:43.360
Primed for.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:44.520
Primed for.

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.280
Prime numbers...

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:49.480
one, two, three, five,

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.520
seven, 11, 13, 17...

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.040
Here we go.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.680
James.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.680
Yes, sir.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:50.840
Yes, sir.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.840
Here we go, folks.

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.120
Okay, this time
it's going to work.

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.480
Here you go... beautiful.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:58.440
Come on, baby.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:01.320
Come on, Daddy wants to see
the sky again.

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.600
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's try again.

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:06.840
Your torque is R,

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.320
cross F...

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:10.560
No, your R is too small, Josh.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.560
Right.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.520
Wait, hold on.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:13.800
What are you laughing at?

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:17.000
No, I mean, it took me and 400
of the world's smartest people

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.680
to come up with the first plan.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:19.800
You want to help?

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.920
No. I want to turn around
and go home.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.400
It's not going to happen.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.120
Well, then we're going to die.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:27.240
True.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.320
All right, look,

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:29.400
- let's start from square one.
- Okay.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:30.360
Let's start from square one.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.320
The bulk modules...
depends on density.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.240
Your torque is R cross F,

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.960
but you have
to integrate volume...

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.800
But here, here...
just consider this.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.600
Now, we got this...

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.120
Okay, now, R cross F,

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.520
we're putting in pi.
What's V?

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:53.120
Oh, for God's sake!

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.480
All right.
I'm hitting him again.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:55.480
No, no, no!

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.800
Braz, no, look, I have a theory.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:30:59.560
Are you interested?

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:00.920
Yes. We're interested.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.720
Then let me smoke a cigarette,
and I'll tell you.

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:13.760
Oh, thank God.

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.720
Hmm? All right, fine, look.

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:19.160
Look, we have to use
wave interference, okay?

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.000
Because one explosion
won't do it.

01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:22.560
Think about stones in a pond.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.480
You drop a large stone
into a pond,

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.640
you get a big splash,

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.280
and then that's it, it's over.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.920
But drop a smaller stone,
wait until the ripples weaken

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.640
and drop another and another,
and another,

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.040
and fluid dynamics 101.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:38.560
The ripples reinforce each other
in geometric progression.

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:41.080
Hm, the whole bigger than
the sum of the parts.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:42.240
Then we'll have five

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.520
200 megaton explosions...

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.080
Instead of one big bang.

01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:48.040
So, we hot-wire the nukes.

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.000
Yes.

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:49.960
And as one does,

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.800
we seed them
through the core...

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:54.720
at locations that have
to be accurate to the inch.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.680
We detonate them in a sequence
that has to be accurate

01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:58.920
to the millisecond...

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:03.080
then we outrun the biggest
nuclear shock wave in history.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.120
Right.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.960
Yeah.

01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:09.800
I mean, that should be
fairly simple.

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:19.400
Destiny now should be
diverting to the central.

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:20.480
Final calibration

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.560
on both transmission systems...

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.360
Come on.

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:30.560
Cut the...
cut the rouge.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.120
The red wire above the circuit.

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.120
Okay. Okay.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.120
No, no, wait, hold it!

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:36.320
I'm sorry, cut it below.

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.200
Please...

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:47.960
Extensions A, B.

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:48.960
- Here we go.
- F, check.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.080
Increase power to reactors
ten through 15

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.120
We're almost there, folks.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.440
Okay, guys we're closing
on the inner core.

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:47.680
The nukes are ready.
Timers are on.

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:50.440
Great.
Let's start dropping them.

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.920
No. The bombs are not built
for these pressures.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.600
That's why they were
in that pod.

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:55.880
If you send them out now...

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.720
out of that casing,
they'll be crushed instantly.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:58.760
I'm assuming we have a Plan D.

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.200
Plan D is
<i>Virgil's</i> compartments.

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:01.160
We put a nuke in

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:02.240
each section of <i>Virgil,</i>

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.240
and then eject the individual
sections one at a time.

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.520
They should stay intact long
enough for the nuke to go off.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.640
Oh...

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.960
What?

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:13.800
<i>Virgil's</i> not designed to eject
undamaged compartments.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:16.040
Okay, these are
the ejection mechanisms

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.960
holding each compartment
in place.

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:21.000
They're all connected
by one master hydraulic gear.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.760
Kind of like keys
on a key ring.

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.520
What we have to do, we have
to unlock the piston.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:28.480
That will release
the compartments

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.040
so the bombs can be jettisoned.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.360
Where's the master gear?

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:34.120
In the crawl space
we used to get out earlier.

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.360
Well, what the hell
is it doing there?

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.800
I built the ship
in three damn months.

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:37.880
I didn't think I'd be

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:39.520
intentionally sabotaging it.
I'm sorry!

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.760
So one of us has to go in there.

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.240
Correct.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.200
Into the crawl space that has
core fluid at 9,000 degrees.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.160
Yes.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.640
Can you flush it
with liquid nitrogen?

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.160
We don't have enough
at this point.

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.280
9,000 degrees.

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.240
And our suits are built
to withstand...?

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.800
Half that, probably.

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:53.800
Right. Half that.

01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:55.200
So what you're saying is

01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.320
whoever goes into that crawl
space, is not coming back.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.200
Hmm.

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:08.280
Together.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.560
Yes, thank you.

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:11.040
Wait.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.840
- On three.
- Okay.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.360
One... two... three.

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.440
Huh.

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:31.800
Well, I better go on,
get myself ready.

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:32.920
No, Braz, wait.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.440
No, Braz, no wait.
Excuse me.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.000
Just a moment, may I see that?

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.000
- No.
- May I?

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:37.960
May I?

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.160
Yes.

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.000
Thank you.

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.520
Magic.

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:47.520
I mean, Braz, three straws
of equal length.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.160
I mean, this is childish.

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.400
Let's do it again.

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:52.280
No, we will not do it again.

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.960
I thought you'd be happy.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:54.920
No. Not at the expense

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.360
of you making us
look like fools.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.560
He's right. Why do you get dibs
on being the hero?

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.000
Because it's my damn ship.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:01.480
Oh, that makes perfect sense.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:04.960
Look, for 20 years, I've done
nothing but <i>Virgil.</i> 20 years.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.320
<i>Virgil</i> belongs to me,

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.040
and I will not let her fail.

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.320
I will not.

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.480
Now if you want to know
what's worth dying for...

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:12.440
this ship.

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:15.360
Building it
instead of imagining it.

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.520
If <i>Virgil</i> needs more blood,
it will be my blood.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.600
Now I am going to go

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.920
and get ready.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.520
Good to go.

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.600
Beck.

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.160
Josh.

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.640
It's a hell of a boat
you built, Braz.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.840
I am really proud to
have known you guys.

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.840
Thank you.

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.040
Braz.

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.120
Edward.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.920
Yes, Conrad?

01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.440
You're right.

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.200
It is your ship.

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:29.000
But I wish to God
it had been ours.

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.120
The chamber's sealed, Beck.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.040
Ready.

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.480
Open the hatch.

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.240
Hang on, Braz.

01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:41.240
Come on, hang on.

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.400
Manual override is complete!

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:35.880
Braz, we can still
get you out of there.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.000
No... start...
start the impeller.

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.280
No.

01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.840
We got a job to do.

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:17.000
Let's do it.

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.960
Let's go.

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:21.360
Magnetic shielding systems
are up.

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.400
Magnetic shielding systems
are up.

01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:24.560
Power level's 85%.

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:26.440
Increase power to Reactor 10.

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:28.480
All personnel should be clear.

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.200
Oh, God!

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:52.160
Okay, she's down.

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.920
Approaching the first
drop-off point.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.680
We got to be accurate
to the second here, boys.

01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:01.120
And drop in three-five seconds.

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:04.160
And... timer on.

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.680
Pull it.

01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.680
Clear... and...

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.280
ejecting.

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:22.480
All right.
Initiate firing sequence.

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.800
Sir...

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:26.240
It's our last shot, Stick.

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.400
Damn you.

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.800
Damn me? Too late.

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:33.160
Ten, nine, eight...

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.520
What's that?

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:41.800
Gotcha!

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.640
...four, three, two...

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.040
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.520
Someone's diverted our energy.

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.760
Where the hell's it gone?!

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:52.400
It looks like...

01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.040
Coney Island.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:59.400
Your Kung Fu is not strong.

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:02.120
Well, how long will it take
to get it back online?

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.840
Well, then get to it!

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:12.480
Oh, hey, General.

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.800
Is there something
I can do for you?

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.320
Timer on.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.160
Clear...

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:24.160
ejecting.

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:32.360
Ejecting.

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:37.720
Pull it.

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:38.920
All right.

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.560
Let's go throw our last little
200 megaton stone in the pond.

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:43.720
I always wanted to make a splash
in nuclear physics.

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:45.360
You know, that energy
propagation stuff

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:46.520
you were talking about...

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:47.880
Oh, that was
high school physics.

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.000
Yeah, it's not exactly...

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.920
I just took the wavelengths
from the core fluid

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.040
off the MRI readings.

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.480
Yeah, and multiplied by 800...

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:54.760
600.

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:57.760
Surely you compensated
for the MRI bias.

01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.120
We got to reset the timers!

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.720
Reset the timers!
No! It just won't work.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.520
It's not the timers!
This is not enough!

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:05.480
What's not enough?

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.680
The last bomb is
not enough.

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:07.880
To complete the wave form.

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.000
Yeah. No. The last bomb
has to be 30%larger.

01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:11.520
That's six or seven pounds
of plutonium.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.800
Where are we going to get six
or seven pounds of plutonium?

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.560
Guys, we got hit

01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.520
by an energy flare.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:24.880
I can't keep us on course.

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.720
Ejecting compartment
in 50 seconds.

01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:28.200
No, Beck! No, wait!
No! Push it!

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:30.240
You push it!

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:31.880
Come on, guys, I can't hear you.

01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:35.600
It's got my shoulder!

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:36.560
Push!

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:37.520
Guys!

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.560
Clear!

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.200
Clear the compartment!
What are you doing?

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.800
I think the flare
has knocked the Coms out.

01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:43.200
I can't get it, Josh.
I can't get it.

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:44.520
Go...

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:46.160
I can't.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.160
Okay.

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:49.760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.720
Can you hear me?

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:53.760
I'm correcting course. Now!

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:00.520
Zimsky!

01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.280
No!

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.800
Push it!

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.480
Ejecting compartment
in ten seconds.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:13.920
Can you hear me?

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.840
Josh, go! Go! Go!

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.480
Get out! Get out!

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:20.960
Now! Get out!
Now! Get out! Go!

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:34.240
Josh.

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:37.200
For the last bomb,
to make it larger...

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.920
use the fuel rods
from the react...

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.160
Ejecting.

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:50.320
I got to get...

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:52.440
I got to...

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:55.400
Beck.

01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:56.560
Beck, can you hear me?

01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:59.280
Beck, if you have any better
ideas, you tell me now.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:01.760
We've only got three minutes
to eject this one.

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.160
Beck!

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:07.240
Come on, guys.
I can't hear you.

01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.440
Beck.

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:54.720
Josh, come on.

01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:58.120
Are you okay?

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:01.320
Are you okay?

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:02.920
Will you take my gloves off?

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.240
Oh, my God.

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:07.520
Please.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:09.640
I had to build the blast.

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:10.760
I'm sorry.

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:12.320
Hold on, let me get...

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:15.040
No. Stay here for one second.

01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:17.400
I was trying to call you.

01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:19.840
I know the Coms were down.

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:20.840
Right.

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:22.360
I know what you did.

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.680
We don't have enough energy...

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:25.640
I know.

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:27.000
...to get back.

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:28.440
You did good.

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:32.400
I would've done the same thing.

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:34.080
Where's Zimsky?

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:38.040
Come here.

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.520
You did good.

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:43.720
You did good.

01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:59.400
One minute
to the first detonation.

01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:01.960
And 12 until the blast hits us.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:09.640
I was hoping we'd suffocate
to death first.

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.760
Beck.

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:47.240
Beck, Beck.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.440
What could you do

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.960
if I got you enough power
to fire the impeller?

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:53.120
Maybe not the laser
but the impeller.

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:54.480
What? From where?

01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:56.360
The heat of the core.

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.080
It's 9,000 degrees.

01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:00.160
Unobtainium converts heat
to energy.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:03.360
So this whole damn ship is like
a big, old solar panel.

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.960
Come on, I need your help.

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.640
Number two's going!

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:15.920
Come on, come on.

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.600
For here in the great infinite
unknowable...

01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:40.960
man can come to know the
most important thing of all:

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.920
Himself.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.600
He can understand...

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.760
What the fuck am I doing?

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.560
We've got full rotation!

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.640
It's turning!

01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:39.360
All right!

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:48.520
Come on, Beck, where is it?

01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:51.880
Come on.
Come on, hurry up.

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:53.360
Is that the last one?

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.560
Yeah.

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:05.440
Give it a couple seconds.

01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.680
It worked!

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:30.400
Get ready to pull a few G's.

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:49.120
420 knots.

01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:50.440
Now, this is more like it.

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:51.240
440.

01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:01.000
So, Rat, what's the center
of this quake?

01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:02.080
It's everywhere!

01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.400
It's one giant shock wave!

01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:05.280
The planet's healing itself.

01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:08.760
At this speed,
we're going to be home

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:11.040
in a third of the time.

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.080
As long as we can surf

01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:43.560
these magma flows,
we'll be okay.

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:45.920
Let's just pray we don't run
into any dead ends,

01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:48.600
or we're going to miss
those lasers.

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:53.880
Okay, navigator, which way?

01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:55.360
We've got greater
fluid density on the left.

01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:57.040
Go with the flow.

01:52:57.120 --> 01:52:58.320
Uh-huh.

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.320
Bill, where are they headed?

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.400
Looks like she found
a space between

01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.480
some tectonic plates
somewhere near Hawaii.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:29.960
Josh...

01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:31.680
Yeah?

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:32.520
They're closing in
on us too fast.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.160
I don't know if I can...

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.360
Hey, you got it.

01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:55.280
Um... w-we lost them, Stick,
and I...

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:17.120
Where'd our power go?

01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:20.120
Well, we're powered by the heat.

01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:22.560
It's stone cold down here.

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.720
Well...

01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:29.600
Look on the bright side.

01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:30.760
At least we're not

01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:32.000
going to boil to death.

01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:33.800
You always look
on the bright side?

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.960
Always.

01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:38.600
Okay, let's assess:

01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:44.000
We've got no communications,

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:45.480
we're probably 800 feet down,

01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:47.200
but we might as well
be 800 miles.

01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:50.560
We're in an Unobtainium

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.120
cigar tube with the sonar
signature of a rock.

01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:56.360
We've got just enough power
to make the ultrasonics burp,

01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:57.640
but no one's listening

01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:00.000
on those frequencies anyway,
and...

01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:01.960
nobody even knows we're alive.

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:09.920
Okay.

01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:12.040
Give me a minute on this one.

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:28.840
This is hopeless.

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:31.400
Come on, General,
we've got to be getting close.

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:32.560
We can't...

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:34.560
Mr. Rat, even if
they were still alive,

01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:35.840
there's no way
they could contact us.

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:37.520
Bridge.

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:41.600
Skipper, Combat relays that our
sub has something on the sonar.

01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:43.240
Where do they think?

01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:45.640
Bill, put it up
on the hydrophone.

01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:50.360
Whales, sir.

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.040
They're a long way off
their usual path,

01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:53.760
but that's not uncommon
since that, uh...

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.000
what are they calling it?

01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:55.960
Orbital wobble?

01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:57.600
Yeah, that's what they call it.

01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.440
Well, thank you
very much, Captain,

01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:00.960
but I think we're done here.

01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:02.760
General.

01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:08.120
J.O., this is the captain.

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:10.360
Stand down from SAR Operations.

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.480
It's whales! It's whales!

01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:45.600
Hey! General!

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:47.320
Stick!

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:48.480
It's whales!

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.240
The ultrasonics!

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.920
They're singing to them!

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.800
You gotta find the whales!

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.920
Alpha X Ray, this is
November Echo six one zero.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.080
I'm changing...

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.480
Hold on, I'm seeing
those whales now.

01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:18.800
Whoa!

01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:20.320
Okay, ball's in the water.

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:23.040
This is neat. Those whales
are circling something.

01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:24.160
Hold on, hold on.

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:25.520
We have a strong echo here.

01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:26.480
Depth, 800 feet.

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:28.120
There-there's something
down there.

01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:29.960
There's definitely
something down there.

01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:13.720
I told you pulsing the
ultrasonics would work.

01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:16.920
Do you ever get tired
of being right?

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:17.920
Yes.

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:22.040
So what's next for you?

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:23.920
A shower.

01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:28.760
Then back to NASA, I guess.

01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:29.920
You?

01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:33.440
Deep-dish pepperoni pizza,
green peppers, onions,

01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:39.000
extra mushrooms... then a shower
and then back to the classroom.

01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:44.560
NASA could use
a few good men, you know.

01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:45.840
Yeah.

01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:49.160
Unfortunately, so could my
freshmen geophysics students.

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:53.520
You know what makes me
really, really angry?

01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:57.480
You know what makes me
really, really angry?

01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:01.000
Bob, Serge, Braz, Zimsky...

01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:03.920
no one's going to ever know
what they did or why they died.

01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:09.320
Unless...

01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:11.160
it all got out somehow.

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:16.680
That's unthinkable.

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:18.000
Yeah.

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:54.160
Okay, here we go.

02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:04.360
Sweet.

02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:20.520
It is now emerging that
the world owes its survival

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:23.520
to the heroism of six
remarkable individuals...

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:25.200
Shuttle Commander
Robert Iverson...

02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:26.520
This extraordinary craft...

02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:27.920
French Scientist, Dr. Serge...

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.320
was captained by NASA astronaut
Dr. Bob Iverson.

02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.840
Edward Brazzleton
is a name so...

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:34.080
Dr. Conrad Zimsky
will be best remembered...

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.200
On Capitol Hill today,

02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:36.960
everyone's asking
the same question...

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.160
What is Project Destiny?

02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:43.680
Destiny, meet world.

02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:46.600
World, meet Destiny.

02:00:55.200 --> 02:01:03.440
Look at the red,
red changes in the sky

02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:11.200
Look at the separation
in the borderline

02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:17.200
But don't look
at everything here inside

02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:19.560
Here inside

02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:27.160
And be afraid,
afraid to speak your mind

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:36.440
It took a moment
before I lost myself in here

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:43.680
It took a moment and
I could not be found

02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:50.080
Again and again
and again and again

02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:53.920
I see your face in everything

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:59.720
It took a moment the moment
it could not be found

02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:17.000
What's with the fascination
with the echelon?

02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:20.480
What's with
the constant questions

02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:25.480
That you have this time?

02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:31.040
What's with this
circumstantial consequence?

02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:33.280
Consequence

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:42.560
Find oversight before this
night will ever rise again

02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:47.840
It's all you've got
inside your head

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:50.200
You better get up
and leave instead

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:56.320
It took a moment before
I lost myself in here

02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:03.680
It took a moment and
I could not be found

02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:09.920
Again and again
and again and again

02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:14.520
I see your face
in everything

02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:19.000
It took a moment the moment
it could not be found

02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:21.880
Found

02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:25.920
To find ourselves
lost here within

02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:29.560
We need good reasons why

02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:31.800
So we take this bridge

02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:37.280
With the others that will thrive
in the great divide

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:51.240
Look at the red,
red changes in the sky.
