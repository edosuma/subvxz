<i>Brother-in-law</i>

01:16.328 --> 01:21.993
ONE DAY

03:16.415 --> 03:17.734
Good morning Mr. Lee.

03:18.079 --> 03:18.679
Oh, hi.

03:18.704 --> 03:19.941
You have a visitor.

03:19.942 --> 03:20.651
I do?

03:20.652 --> 03:22.150
He's in the waiting room.

03:35.713 --> 03:36.754
Hey, Young-woo!

03:38.786 --> 03:40.077
It's been awhile.

03:43.067 --> 03:44.567
How could you?

03:47.609 --> 03:51.192
Why don't we talk outside?

03:54.025 --> 03:56.942
It's like you were waiting
for her to die!

03:58.150 --> 03:59.150
Huh?

03:59.484 --> 04:02.109
Now that she's gone,
you must be relieved.

04:10.522 --> 04:13.063
You better watch what you say.

04:13.832 --> 04:15.332
Then go ahead, deny it.

04:15.892 --> 04:16.484
Come on.

04:16.485 --> 04:17.954
Just do it.

04:17.983 --> 04:18.983
Stop that.

04:18.984 --> 04:20.483
Say it!

04:20.484 --> 04:21.982
What's going on?

04:21.983 --> 04:23.484
Nothing.

04:24.173 --> 04:26.751
He's not usually like this.
He's just in a bad mood today.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.400
Stop that!

04:28.401 --> 04:29.900
Are you okay, Sir?

04:36.017 --> 04:39.192
So there is no way to settle?

04:39.657 --> 04:41.316
What have you done?

04:41.317 --> 04:42.234
I'm very sorry, Sir.

04:42.235 --> 04:45.259
We need to close this case ASAP!

04:45.395 --> 04:47.520
You know what I'm saying?

04:48.484 --> 04:49.767
What happened to you?

04:56.108 --> 04:57.108
Nothing.

04:57.584 --> 04:59.084
Go on.

04:59.319 --> 05:00.819
Are you okay?

05:01.786 --> 05:04.542
What's going on?

05:04.868 --> 05:06.257
A traffic accident.

05:06.282 --> 05:11.564
And the girl is in a coma,
for 2 months now.

05:12.141 --> 05:14.601
The driver was found 100% responsible.

05:14.626 --> 05:16.196
He's our client.

05:16.860 --> 05:18.483
The victim is blind.

05:18.484 --> 05:21.275
So it's bad for us.

05:21.907 --> 05:23.949
Can't settle with the family?

05:24.400 --> 05:28.703
She's an orphan, so
her guardian should settle,

05:28.728 --> 05:30.743
except she won't budge.

05:31.431 --> 05:34.345
No excuse! If she doesn't budge,

05:34.390 --> 05:36.150
make her budge.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.150
Geez,

05:40.033 --> 05:43.064
this client is the son of our CEO's friend.

05:43.946 --> 05:45.401
We're all dead,

05:45.947 --> 05:47.947
if he ends up in jail.

05:52.884 --> 05:54.317
Find a solution, please?

05:54.775 --> 05:57.650
You must be sick of the desk work now.

05:57.651 --> 06:00.946
Just get back out there, okay?

06:02.333 --> 06:03.298
- Hey Mr. Cha.
- Sir?

06:03.323 --> 06:06.650
Hand over everything to Mr. Lee.

06:08.752 --> 06:09.752
Will do.

06:09.955 --> 06:12.755
Look over the files and start on the case.

06:33.584 --> 06:35.084
Hi Mr. Lee!

06:35.435 --> 06:36.601
How have you been?

06:36.626 --> 06:38.127
Long time no see.

06:38.317 --> 06:39.567
What's that over there?

06:40.171 --> 06:41.212
What?

06:43.963 --> 06:45.696
Great day, huh?

06:46.081 --> 06:47.580
I'll see you around, okay?

06:50.854 --> 06:51.979
Hey, Dr. Kim!

06:56.953 --> 06:57.953
Oh well.

06:58.511 --> 06:59.304
Hey.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.614
Good to see you!

07:00.639 --> 07:01.790
How's it going?

07:07.937 --> 07:09.056
It's been awhile.

07:09.081 --> 07:10.475
I know. How are you?

07:10.500 --> 07:11.126
Good.

07:11.126 --> 07:11.996
I'll see you soon.

07:12.021 --> 07:13.021
Okay.

07:21.418 --> 07:22.667
Excuse me.

07:29.504 --> 07:30.880
Anyone here?

07:56.032 --> 07:57.407
Ms. Dan Mi-so,

08:00.908 --> 08:03.574
I'm Lee Kwang-soo from Korean Insurance.

08:04.610 --> 08:10.836
I'm here to investigate possible
insurance fraud for your accident...

09:18.583 --> 09:20.209
Wait, you can see me?

09:20.459 --> 09:21.032
What?

09:21.057 --> 09:22.057
Uh-oh.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.500
You can see me!

09:31.167 --> 09:32.334
Who are you?

09:33.164 --> 09:35.132
Oh hi. I'm with Korean Insurance.

09:35.157 --> 09:35.875
Again?

09:35.876 --> 09:37.209
You look new.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.477
Yeah, I just took it over.

09:39.578 --> 09:42.702
- Why do you keep coming?
- Why are you going through my stuff?

09:42.727 --> 09:45.996
I wasn't. I was just looking.

09:46.021 --> 09:47.396
You did what?

09:47.930 --> 09:49.758
No, I wasn't going through it.

09:49.993 --> 09:52.660
I was just looking at the stuff on top...

09:52.950 --> 09:53.950
Huh?

09:56.055 --> 10:02.292
Well, I've seen the patient,
I can come back later.

10:02.432 --> 10:03.807
- Okay.
- You're leaving?

10:04.709 --> 10:05.917
I'll be back.

10:06.334 --> 10:07.500
Again?

10:07.875 --> 10:08.875
Yes...

10:25.743 --> 10:27.476
I met with the doctor too.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.810
He said there hasn't been any progress.

10:29.951 --> 10:33.352
<i>He didn't say that she could die
soon or anything like that?</i>

10:33.970 --> 10:37.297
<i>It will be easier to reach
a settlement if she dies.</i>

10:37.368 --> 10:38.968
<i>What about her guardian?</i>

10:40.901 --> 10:42.297
I'm on my way to see her.

10:42.322 --> 10:45.969
<i>See if you can change her mind.
I'm counting on you!</i>

10:49.542 --> 10:52.399
What a scumbag.

11:18.617 --> 11:19.617
My turn!

11:24.521 --> 11:25.875
- Wow!
- Gotcha!

11:28.948 --> 11:30.656
It's alright.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.459
How much did I lose?

11:35.750 --> 11:37.649
- Here we go again!
- Man!

11:42.407 --> 11:45.781
Having fun? Can I join?

11:50.164 --> 11:54.032

My legs...

12:10.932 --> 12:12.099
I missed you.

12:12.825 --> 12:14.616
Yeah, yeah. So did I.

12:15.804 --> 12:20.219
You don't look so good.
Are you sick, for real?

12:20.759 --> 12:23.094
Why are you always doing this to me?

12:23.188 --> 12:26.016
I'm not the only bogus patients here.

12:26.917 --> 12:29.875
I thought you stopped
working in the field now.

12:34.084 --> 12:36.594
I told you I missed you.

12:41.542 --> 12:42.709
Damn it.

12:45.794 --> 12:47.280
So you two go way back.

12:47.305 --> 12:51.063
And worked together. You must be close.

12:51.149 --> 12:54.852
Did you notice anything strange,
before the accident?

12:55.352 --> 12:56.644
What're you saying?

12:56.950 --> 13:01.200
Did anything happen?
Did she get depressed...?

13:02.664 --> 13:04.334
Nope.

13:07.216 --> 13:11.757
The accident occurred in Gangwon.
Why did she go there?

13:13.073 --> 13:15.323
Maybe she just took a trip.

13:17.711 --> 13:22.258
A blind, all by herself?

13:23.602 --> 13:25.167
Visually impaired.

13:25.586 --> 13:26.447
Excuse me?

13:26.472 --> 13:28.930
Not blind, visually impaired.

13:30.071 --> 13:33.907
I see. My apology.

13:34.625 --> 13:38.766
A few of you came here.
And asked exactly one thing.

13:39.420 --> 13:42.235
Whether she tried to kill herself.

13:42.574 --> 13:43.866
That's not how I meant...

13:43.891 --> 13:45.209
Please leave.

- Yes.

14:31.703 --> 14:33.245

<i>A stick for the blind?</i>

14:36.873 --> 14:39.914

<i>Right.</i>

- Please come in.

15:01.290 --> 15:03.423
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

15:15.279 --> 15:18.571
Sorry I didn't come to the funeral.

15:19.227 --> 15:24.922
No, no. You've been busy.

15:26.234 --> 15:31.526
I heard Young-woo made
a scene at your office.

15:32.532 --> 15:33.742
I'm sorry.

15:33.962 --> 15:37.375
It was fine. I'm okay.

15:43.165 --> 15:44.955
Oh, I almost forgot.
These go into the fridge.

15:44.979 --> 15:46.479
I've got this, Mother.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.930
So upstairs.

15:53.830 --> 15:55.789
Did you have a chance to clear up?

15:57.638 --> 16:00.407
No, I've been busy.

What are you doing?

16:43.891 --> 16:46.055
It's not fully fermented yet!

16:47.461 --> 16:48.883
Try some. It's good.

No way.

Weren't you... scared though?

you must get scared, right?

20:03.963 --> 20:05.619
Yes, I'm sure.

20:06.268 --> 20:08.072
I'm sure you were scared.

20:19.330 --> 20:21.228
But you know what...?

20:25.479 --> 20:27.627
I admire...

20:31.064 --> 20:32.877
your courage.

20:36.330 --> 20:44.203

21:04.008 --> 21:05.875
It's a pretty.

21:06.274 --> 21:07.540
It's a pretty name.

21:09.309 --> 21:15.144
One of my friend really hated her name.

21:16.375 --> 21:22.430
Sun-hwa, it means 'good flower'.

21:23.734 --> 21:29.758
I liked it but she thought it was tacky.

Yes, Choi Doo-yong. At #209? Thanks.

23:58.734 --> 24:00.219
Where did she go?

24:00.954 --> 24:02.411
Who?

24:03.359 --> 24:04.818
She was just here.

24:06.495 --> 24:07.954
I didn't see anyone.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.698
Are you sure?

24:20.176 --> 24:21.343
Who won yesterday?

24:21.368 --> 24:23.034
It was all Min-ji.

24:25.252 --> 24:26.495
Good morning!

24:27.017 --> 24:28.142
You scared me.

24:29.067 --> 24:31.318
You've been busy, I see.

24:32.817 --> 24:35.025
What are you doing here?

24:35.026 --> 24:37.346
It's like the universe is
calling out to me here.

24:37.425 --> 24:41.588
Well, go on. I'm up for
another appointment.

24:48.151 --> 24:49.733
Would you stop that?

24:49.734 --> 24:51.120
What do you mean?

24:53.221 --> 24:55.502
I could hand you over
for special investigation.

24:56.234 --> 24:58.483
I'm not faking!

24:59.775 --> 25:03.400
You and I go way back.

25:03.609 --> 25:06.066
Just let this slide, will you?

25:06.067 --> 25:11.608
I'm going easy on you.
Others would've reported you.

25:11.609 --> 25:13.643
You'd be in for a big lawsuit.

25:16.609 --> 25:18.192
Remember me?

25:25.483 --> 25:27.608
I was going to wake you up earlier,

25:27.609 --> 25:30.067
but you looked tired. So I didn't.

25:32.151 --> 25:33.524
Who are you?

25:33.525 --> 25:35.399
- Me? I'm Choi Doo-yong.
- I'm Dan Mi-so.

25:35.400 --> 25:39.608
Dan Mi-so? Would you cut it out?

25:39.609 --> 25:41.483
I'm Dan Mi-so.

25:41.893 --> 25:46.767
Who're you kidding? I said who are you?

25:47.104 --> 25:48.159
You?

25:48.192 --> 25:50.775
Damn it, I told you!

25:51.483 --> 25:53.557
Just calm down and listen.

25:53.651 --> 25:56.126
You better watch your attitude!

25:56.151 --> 25:58.775
Not you, man. Look at her.

25:59.213 --> 26:02.159
It's no use. He can't see me.

26:02.434 --> 26:04.315
Don't you see this girl?

26:06.448 --> 26:08.834
If you're kidding, it's not fun.

26:09.259 --> 26:12.398
She's talking crazy over here.

26:12.423 --> 26:14.131
Why are you doing this to me?

26:14.156 --> 26:14.835
Mr. Lee?

26:14.875 --> 26:18.398
You came to return my pebble
last night, right?

26:19.698 --> 26:21.398
How do you know?

26:21.422 --> 26:22.734
What's wrong with you?

26:22.759 --> 26:24.510
Because I'm Mi-so.

26:25.304 --> 26:27.137
If you're Mi-so,

26:27.191 --> 26:29.690
who's that girl lying there?

26:29.765 --> 26:32.232
- That girl is me!
- I better leave.

26:32.945 --> 26:36.741
Look lady, I don't know you

26:36.922 --> 26:40.280
but that's enough. OK?

26:41.060 --> 26:43.144
I had a really long day.

26:43.483 --> 26:44.690
Wait!

26:45.829 --> 26:52.787
Would you just listen? I can explain.

26:53.190 --> 26:55.523
- I don't need any explanation.
- Hold on.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.780
What do you want?

26:57.972 --> 26:59.596
Just listen.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.285
Okay, okay. Go on.

27:02.526 --> 27:04.651
Uh... well...

27:05.294 --> 27:11.968
Will you stop that? I'm a busy man.

27:29.725 --> 27:31.184
I know you're shocked.

27:48.288 --> 27:51.217
Oh... oh... I gotta go.

27:51.242 --> 27:52.450
Well...

27:52.755 --> 27:54.030
Mr. Lee!

27:55.093 --> 27:56.627
You're leaving early...

28:02.592 --> 28:04.509
Ouch. That must hurt.

28:24.092 --> 28:28.050
<i>Sun-hwa</i>

28:44.929 --> 28:45.929
<i>Honey,</i>

28:49.289 --> 28:50.609
<i>it's me.</i>

30:50.551 --> 30:52.467
She is dreaming now.

30:53.759 --> 30:57.382
When she's asleep, I'm here.

30:58.134 --> 31:00.426
When she awakes, I'm gone.

31:01.345 --> 31:02.345
So...

31:04.259 --> 31:05.925
Since when?

31:06.938 --> 31:08.563
Since the accident.

31:09.525 --> 31:12.853
Suddenly, I was watching her from outside.

31:13.110 --> 31:14.443
It was weird.

31:14.577 --> 31:16.828
I can see everything.

31:18.134 --> 31:19.758
But people can't see me.

31:19.759 --> 31:22.050
That wasn't nice.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.509
So only I can see you?

31:25.967 --> 31:27.842
Looks that way.

31:31.259 --> 31:33.425
So you're a ghost.

31:33.426 --> 31:38.883
Ghosts are dead.
But look, I'm still breathing.

31:44.509 --> 31:47.175
Why is this happening to me?

31:47.842 --> 31:49.342
I understand.

31:49.922 --> 31:52.492
That was my reaction too.

31:55.213 --> 31:57.146
So what's gonna happen to me?

31:57.464 --> 31:59.571
You're asking the wrong person.

31:59.596 --> 32:04.262
You're obviously curious.
Asking all those questions.

32:07.009 --> 32:08.759
Not really...

32:09.193 --> 32:10.651
I could die, I guess?

32:11.810 --> 32:17.032
Why would you think that?

32:22.705 --> 32:27.501
At least someone can see me.

32:28.009 --> 32:30.175
That's a relief.

32:32.375 --> 32:35.666
Can I ask you a favor?

32:36.372 --> 32:37.372
What is it?

32:38.175 --> 32:39.175
No way.

32:39.359 --> 32:43.234
- I really need your help!
- I told you, I'm busy!

32:43.259 --> 32:44.508
Please...

32:44.509 --> 32:47.508
I'm already going crazy
just talking to you.

32:47.509 --> 32:49.341
And now, you want me to take you where?

32:49.342 --> 32:50.508
I'm begging you.

32:50.509 --> 32:54.025
I'm begging you to go by yourself, okay?

32:54.050 --> 32:57.342
You're almost a ghost.
You can go anywhere, no?

32:57.502 --> 32:59.235
Fly or teleport, whatever!

32:59.329 --> 33:01.234
Read a magic spell and disappear.

33:01.259 --> 33:04.675
I can't. I'm too scared
to go out by myself.

33:04.676 --> 33:07.301
Scared? You scare me!

33:07.426 --> 33:11.008
Even if I go out, I
wouldn't know where to go.

33:11.009 --> 33:12.300
It's none of my business.

33:12.301 --> 33:14.175
Please, sir...

33:18.947 --> 33:21.048
Please, please, please...

33:44.718 --> 33:45.718
Wow.

33:47.426 --> 33:48.925
How did they build all that?

33:50.009 --> 33:51.009
Well.

33:51.767 --> 33:53.808
Ah, you don't know?

33:56.259 --> 33:57.592
That's a train, right?

33:58.509 --> 33:59.799
That's a tram.

33:59.800 --> 34:03.216
Right. I saw it on TV.

34:03.217 --> 34:04.790
You 'saw' it on TV?

34:04.931 --> 34:06.540
What's that?

34:07.259 --> 34:08.609
That's a gas station.

34:08.634 --> 34:13.759
That's how they fill the tank. Amazing!

34:14.175 --> 34:18.092
Geez, he scared me!

34:19.467 --> 34:21.842
You scared me, lady!

34:22.759 --> 34:24.509
What was that?

34:26.509 --> 34:27.551
Motorcycle.

34:27.800 --> 34:30.551
Ah... motorcycle...

34:31.676 --> 34:34.551
Do you even know what it is?

34:35.050 --> 34:37.174
Of course, I've heard of it.

34:37.175 --> 34:39.426
Well, now you know how it looks.

34:39.925 --> 34:42.050
That I do.

34:42.142 --> 34:43.978
- Good.
- Motor...

34:44.563 --> 34:47.563
- Now we start the wedding of...
- We're late!

34:49.493 --> 34:51.494
I'll wait here. So go ahead.

34:57.829 --> 34:58.829
Damn it...

35:09.509 --> 35:13.008
Now the bride and groom
will exchange bows.

35:13.009 --> 35:15.384
Go ahead, face each other.

35:19.509 --> 35:22.759
Let's exchange bows in respect.

35:23.592 --> 35:25.718
They look great together.

35:27.563 --> 35:30.146
A round of applause everyone!

35:30.352 --> 35:32.735
- Now, please face forward.
- Don't they?

35:38.033 --> 35:45.787
Now it's time to exchange wedding rings.

35:49.718 --> 35:54.050
This is the last to chance to bail out!

35:54.384 --> 35:56.259
Any objection to this marriage?

36:01.842 --> 36:03.634
What are you doing?

36:06.216 --> 36:10.279
Ah, no no. It isn't me. Sorry.

36:15.459 --> 36:16.716
Sorry.

36:19.217 --> 36:21.443
Really, it's not me.

36:22.803 --> 36:25.365
You must be a friend of these two.

36:25.397 --> 36:27.794
Guess he prepared a surprise event.

36:27.897 --> 36:32.576
- Now, let's watch a special video.
- Are you kidding me?

36:33.318 --> 36:36.154
<i>Congrats on your wedding!</i>

36:36.344 --> 36:40.969
<i>I love you two.</i>

36:42.217 --> 36:47.451
<i>I wish you the best.</i>

36:48.188 --> 36:49.646
<i>I love you.</i>

36:51.303 --> 36:52.887
<i>Good boy!</i>

36:53.139 --> 36:56.982
<i>- He only listens to you.
- Down boy. Good!</i>

36:57.544 --> 37:01.551
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

37:01.967 --> 37:04.592
<i>Give some to Mi-so.</i>

37:05.037 --> 37:10.162
<i>- No sharing?
- Everyone got a piece?</i>

37:14.613 --> 37:15.988
<i>I chose it, actually...</i>

37:19.569 --> 37:21.611
<i>- It's so good.
- Thanks!</i>

37:23.592 --> 37:28.013
<i>Congratulations on your marriage!</i>

37:32.605 --> 37:35.169
You must be really close to them huh?

37:35.904 --> 37:38.849
Yeah. They're like my family.

37:47.967 --> 37:50.759
It's so nice to see you for real.

37:54.262 --> 37:55.766
His name is Mango.

37:55.904 --> 37:57.304
He was my guide dog.

37:58.232 --> 38:00.388
And now lives here.

38:01.674 --> 38:03.825
Do you wanna touch his chin? He loves it.

38:04.154 --> 38:05.154
Pardon me?

38:08.420 --> 38:09.754
Go ahead.

38:10.670 --> 38:12.170
You know I can't.

38:13.310 --> 38:15.268
Dogs scare me.

38:22.912 --> 38:24.246
He doesn't bite, right?

38:24.271 --> 38:27.384
Of course not. He's a good dog.

38:30.342 --> 38:31.467
Good boy.

38:33.342 --> 38:35.107
Right?

38:48.595 --> 38:49.595
Shall we go?

39:34.601 --> 39:36.059
Take care, Mango.

39:59.601 --> 40:05.183
Will I ever wake up again?

40:12.475 --> 40:15.726
You are the only person I can ask.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.809
Thank you for today.

40:43.601 --> 40:46.017
About my accident report.

40:46.018 --> 40:48.683
Do what you need to do.

40:48.684 --> 40:50.851
It doesn't matter to me.

42:13.100 --> 42:14.851
So where is the guardian?

42:16.183 --> 42:17.559
She's on her honeymoon.

42:18.059 --> 42:20.267
So what, we just wait?

42:22.408 --> 42:28.645
Also the representative doesn't
seem to want to settle it.

42:29.309 --> 42:31.767
So we can't do anything?

42:32.142 --> 42:36.309
We keep paying and
our client ends up in jail?

42:39.976 --> 42:43.601
I got a call from upstairs.

42:44.350 --> 42:46.474
About your promotion.

42:46.475 --> 42:48.769
Aren't you worried at all?

42:50.043 --> 42:55.049
And you're spending all the money you
have paying your wife's hospital bills.

42:55.074 --> 43:00.116
Will you quit it? I heard you.

43:00.397 --> 43:03.023
There must be a way to make them settle!

43:05.597 --> 43:09.263
You know I love you right?

43:20.150 --> 43:21.150
Mr. Lee.

43:21.736 --> 43:22.778
Yes.

43:23.282 --> 43:28.240
I found something for Mi-so's case.

43:29.509 --> 43:30.509
What is it?

43:33.979 --> 43:36.432
I read the papers again.

43:36.457 --> 43:40.487
And there was no walking stick
at the site of the accident.

43:41.183 --> 43:42.601
I know that already.

43:46.434 --> 43:47.517
You did?

43:49.191 --> 43:51.566
So that's our catch.

43:51.591 --> 43:53.556
Since a blind rarely walks without

43:53.581 --> 43:55.398
a walking stick, it could be a suicide...

43:55.434 --> 43:57.100
I'll handle that.

44:03.267 --> 44:04.892
So you knew.

44:09.309 --> 44:13.767
And Mr. Cha.

44:13.892 --> 44:17.684
She's not a blind.
She's visually impaired.

44:19.796 --> 44:21.046
You got that?

44:23.321 --> 44:24.321
Ah, yes.

44:27.442 --> 44:30.440
Tell me about the accident...

44:33.973 --> 44:39.256
I was on my way home from work, waiting for
the traffic light at the intersection...

44:53.909 --> 44:55.617
How is she today?

44:55.642 --> 45:01.018
Good, I guess.
She's sleeping a lot though.

45:21.491 --> 45:22.283
Hello.

45:22.308 --> 45:23.433
<i>Where are you?</i>

45:23.573 --> 45:25.366
I'm at the hospital.

45:25.391 --> 45:28.933
<i>About that Mi-so case, I heard
there was no walking stick.</i>

45:29.051 --> 45:29.509
Excuse me?

45:29.778 --> 45:33.928
<i>Cha says there was no walking
stick at the site. You knew?</i>

45:34.414 --> 45:35.163
Oh yes.

45:35.188 --> 45:38.730
<i>And? That's our leverage.</i>

45:38.954 --> 45:42.158
What am I supposed to do? The
representative won't budge.

45:42.183 --> 45:48.334
<i>Think, you idiot.
A blind with no cane, it's a suicide.</i>

45:48.359 --> 45:51.858
<i>We're going to a trial,
if she doesn't cave.</i>

45:51.883 --> 45:54.509
Is that really necessary?

45:54.534 --> 45:58.826
<i>We're gonna close the
case one and for all, okay?</i>

45:59.320 --> 46:01.278
Hello, hello?

46:11.845 --> 46:14.887
Are you going out? Or being discharged?

46:14.912 --> 46:16.745
Something urgent came up.

46:17.708 --> 46:21.250
Don't you have a job?
Stop following me around!

46:21.354 --> 46:23.770
I'm reporting you, right now.

46:26.624 --> 46:29.041
Mr. Lee, come on.

46:29.566 --> 46:32.899
I've been nice to you so far.

46:33.580 --> 46:37.321
Just a few more days. I
really have a situation.

46:37.346 --> 46:40.021
Please, I'm asking you.

46:41.724 --> 46:44.391
I'm done listening to you.

46:45.720 --> 46:49.553
Just sign here, right now.

46:51.897 --> 46:55.480
You know it inside and out already.

46:55.644 --> 46:56.852
Just sign it.

46:58.537 --> 47:00.746
You're so uptight.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.659
You don't have the right to say that.

47:05.684 --> 47:08.309
Many people try to live sincere lives.

47:08.334 --> 47:12.409
What are you doing? You're taking
advantage of your insurance!

47:12.434 --> 47:14.183
Like leeches.

47:15.676 --> 47:19.134
What did you say?

47:20.621 --> 47:21.621
Well.

47:22.910 --> 47:24.576
How dare you?

47:24.601 --> 47:27.892
I don't deserve this.

47:28.225 --> 47:29.726
Not from you!

47:30.534 --> 47:32.492
So what, you're gonna hit me now?

47:32.517 --> 47:34.267
That's right, you moron.

47:34.867 --> 47:37.034
This is your lucky day.

47:37.059 --> 47:40.130
Well then, go ahead.

47:40.155 --> 47:41.405
You don't scare me.

47:51.733 --> 47:52.983
Signed.

47:55.707 --> 47:57.457
OK? I'm gonna go.

48:12.996 --> 48:16.496
<i>Mr. Bastard</i>

48:19.626 --> 48:21.043
Hey...

48:22.242 --> 48:25.659
Have you ever seen a ghost?

48:26.082 --> 48:27.082
Sure.

48:29.536 --> 48:30.869
For real?

48:31.935 --> 48:35.311
There's one right now. Right next to you.

49:30.017 --> 49:31.351
What're you doing?

49:35.742 --> 49:37.951
Just appreciating the sunlight.

49:38.523 --> 49:44.148
Oh yeah? I'll join you.

49:47.218 --> 49:54.276
Looking down from up here, I feel
like human beings are so tiny.

49:56.856 --> 50:00.481
Like the pebbles I collect,
don't you think?

50:02.087 --> 50:03.629
Why do you collect them?

50:06.275 --> 50:09.900
I just like touching it.

50:11.814 --> 50:15.768
Because we rely on touch a lot.

50:17.007 --> 50:20.466
I can indicate everything with my hand.

50:20.491 --> 50:22.990
And if not, smell.

50:27.178 --> 50:28.178
Give it.

50:29.015 --> 50:30.640
- Give you what?
- Your hand.

50:31.039 --> 50:32.081
What for?

50:32.106 --> 50:33.106
Just give it!

50:34.861 --> 50:35.861
Geez...

50:42.050 --> 50:43.758
Through touch...

50:46.076 --> 50:51.886
I can feel how the person's been
living his live, without seeing him.

50:58.026 --> 50:59.026
Try with mine.

50:59.702 --> 51:00.744
No.

51:00.901 --> 51:01.901
Just try it.

51:07.252 --> 51:07.752
Fine.

51:07.777 --> 51:09.069
Close your eyes!

51:24.832 --> 51:26.290
Well?

51:29.587 --> 51:31.545
I'm not sure what I'm doing.

51:35.535 --> 51:37.993
Once you get used to it,

51:38.900 --> 51:45.205
you learn a lot just by touching.

51:48.422 --> 51:50.589
Isn't it better that you can see now?

51:51.827 --> 51:52.827
Of course.

51:55.040 --> 52:00.984
But... now I can't touch.

52:03.139 --> 52:04.473
It's weird.

52:06.037 --> 52:11.079
Like being a little mermaid?

52:12.578 --> 52:14.328
Mermaid...

52:15.649 --> 52:17.816
God doesn't give us everything.

52:18.662 --> 52:20.662
I guess that's only fair.

52:30.231 --> 52:31.897
Hey, let's get out of here.

53:05.189 --> 53:06.709
How does it feel to see them for real?

53:07.240 --> 53:08.282
Love it.

53:08.307 --> 53:09.349
It's awesome.

53:09.701 --> 53:10.993
Look!

53:12.005 --> 53:13.671
Mommy, it looks like a rainbow!

53:13.696 --> 53:14.613
A rainbow?

53:14.638 --> 53:16.220
It sparkles like a rainbow.

53:16.245 --> 53:19.204
Oh yeah. You're right!

53:27.637 --> 53:31.178
Do you remember anything about your mom?

53:33.933 --> 53:38.516
Just her voice. I was too little anyway.

53:42.284 --> 53:48.659
She left me at church when I was 4.

53:49.190 --> 53:51.481
With only a photo of a
birthday in my pocket

53:52.428 --> 53:56.595
written about my birthday and name.

54:00.863 --> 54:03.738
She probably gave me my name as 'Mi-so'

54:05.438 --> 54:07.646
because she wanted me to smile.

54:16.524 --> 54:22.258
She probably sent me away because it was
hard for her to raise me. I understand.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.576
I would do the same if I were her.

54:26.663 --> 54:29.080
Do you miss her?

54:35.659 --> 54:39.534
I used to but not anymore.

54:40.785 --> 54:43.285
I'm already grown up and...

54:43.512 --> 54:45.928
It was such a long time ago.

54:56.869 --> 55:03.036
I feel like I've been here.
I can smell sesame seed...

55:03.061 --> 55:05.518
From where? How?

55:05.543 --> 55:06.585
It's fresh.

55:09.127 --> 55:11.252
Ah.. that's how it's done.

55:11.378 --> 55:15.046
These are sold in plastic bags still?

55:15.368 --> 55:17.702
Oh, look at that.

55:46.577 --> 55:50.034
<i>Doesn't it look like snow?</i>

55:51.332 --> 55:54.415
It does look like snow.

56:49.700 --> 56:54.034
Well? I used to travel a lot.

56:55.201 --> 56:57.534
How far have you gone?

56:58.855 --> 57:00.688
Not drinking today?

57:02.821 --> 57:05.988
I have to drive.

57:06.685 --> 57:08.685
I have to drive someone's home.

57:13.290 --> 57:16.331
You can't see her? She's right here.

57:16.356 --> 57:18.106
Right.

57:20.715 --> 57:22.340
She is pretty.

57:22.732 --> 57:24.108
I'll buy one.

57:25.932 --> 57:27.765
Can she see me?

57:28.844 --> 57:31.969
Not sure.

57:38.897 --> 57:41.022
You scared me.

57:42.384 --> 57:43.716
Blue Hawaii.

57:44.284 --> 57:45.534
Blue Hawaii?

57:46.950 --> 57:48.616
Like the ocean.

57:48.877 --> 57:50.252
Whoa.

57:50.277 --> 57:51.902
So pretty.

57:55.152 --> 57:57.276
Not sure if you can drink it.

57:57.301 --> 57:59.092
Take a close look.

58:28.219 --> 58:30.384
It's an old photo.

58:31.456 --> 58:33.456
The house can't be there still.

58:33.699 --> 58:37.324
But you're the expert.
I know you can do it.

58:38.881 --> 58:40.339
I'll give it a try.

58:44.551 --> 58:48.009
Don't let anybody else know.
Especially my team manager.

58:48.353 --> 58:50.312
Is this something personal?

58:51.218 --> 58:52.509
You could say that.

58:52.534 --> 58:53.243
I'm sorry.

58:53.268 --> 58:56.644
Where the hell is Mr. Lee?

58:56.669 --> 58:58.210
He's out on the field work.

58:58.235 --> 59:00.652
I didn't send him out for
this petty commission.

59:02.674 --> 59:04.407
I have a favor to ask you.

59:04.872 --> 59:07.039
He's not even answering the phone!

59:07.767 --> 59:09.891
<i>Investigation Report</i>

59:11.340 --> 59:16.299
<i>The photo was taken
at a studio in Gangwon.</i>

59:17.441 --> 59:21.108
<i>That's where the accident
happened, right?</i>

59:40.394 --> 59:41.560
<i>Hello, it's a hair salon.</i>

59:41.585 --> 59:43.877
Hi, can I speak to Ms. Kim?

59:44.641 --> 59:47.641
<i>Speaking, who's this?</i>

1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:39.758
Hi, you're here for a haircut?

1:00:42.222 --> 1:00:43.222
Yes.

1:00:51.226 --> 1:00:55.267
Do you have any children?

1:00:55.833 --> 1:00:58.208
Yes, why?

1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:00.240
Do you have a girl?

1:01:00.892 --> 1:01:03.725
She's at school. Do you know her?

1:01:04.881 --> 1:01:12.239
Not that daughter. By any chance...
A long time ago...

1:01:12.448 --> 1:01:14.573
Dan Mi-so.

1:01:18.236 --> 1:01:21.278
She's my friend.

1:01:23.620 --> 1:01:27.288
About 2 months ago, she came here.

1:01:30.369 --> 1:01:32.451
I don't understand.

1:01:34.477 --> 1:01:40.820
She got into a car accident near
here on March 5th around 3:50.

1:01:41.788 --> 1:01:49.999
She's hospitalized at the National
Hospital, and she's a vegetable now.

1:01:57.283 --> 1:01:57.824
Stop it.

1:01:57.849 --> 1:01:59.724
I want you to leave.

1:02:01.940 --> 1:02:03.981
Don't you want to see her?

1:02:04.006 --> 1:02:06.590
I don't know who she is. Leave. Now!

1:02:56.009 --> 1:02:57.134
Thank you.

1:02:57.159 --> 1:02:58.450
See you later, guys.

1:03:00.185 --> 1:03:01.852
Thank you.

1:03:15.997 --> 1:03:18.414
So that's it then?

1:03:19.649 --> 1:03:24.479
You didn't show up for
days, and no settlement?

1:03:27.539 --> 1:03:28.497
Mr. Cha.

1:03:28.522 --> 1:03:28.980
Sir?

1:03:29.005 --> 1:03:31.464
I'm giving you Lee's cases back to you.

1:03:31.489 --> 1:03:36.654
It looks like this one
needs more time off.

1:03:37.395 --> 1:03:40.645
You take back the blind girl's case.

1:03:40.670 --> 1:03:43.753
Threaten them with lawsuit, okay?

1:03:46.030 --> 1:03:47.739
Damn it.

1:03:53.940 --> 1:03:55.065
Hey!

1:03:55.340 --> 1:03:57.881
Up here!

1:04:00.311 --> 1:04:01.436
Come up here. Hurry!

1:04:02.258 --> 1:04:06.675
What's going on? And I...

1:04:10.134 --> 1:04:13.093
You should help him.

1:04:15.272 --> 1:04:16.147
I can't.

1:04:16.172 --> 1:04:19.506
He's here all by himself.

1:04:20.211 --> 1:04:23.670
They are all families.
I'm not even his father.

1:04:23.695 --> 1:04:25.362
Just pretend it.

1:04:25.387 --> 1:04:26.345
I can't do that!

1:04:26.370 --> 1:04:30.120
You look like father from head to toe.

1:04:30.145 --> 1:04:31.645
No I'm not. I can't.

1:04:31.670 --> 1:04:32.795
Please, just this once.

1:04:32.820 --> 1:04:35.861
Dad, dad, just this once okay?

1:04:35.886 --> 1:04:36.886
I said, no!

1:04:51.936 --> 1:04:54.811
Can I take a look?

1:04:58.990 --> 1:05:01.699
It looks so difficult.

1:05:07.146 --> 1:05:09.605
Your dad looks like a nice guy.

1:05:13.003 --> 1:05:14.461
Where is he?

1:05:15.291 --> 1:05:18.667
He says my hospital bills
are really expensive.

1:05:18.692 --> 1:05:23.908
So he works at construction sites in
the day and does deliveries at night.

1:05:32.140 --> 1:05:33.140
There you go.

1:05:34.286 --> 1:05:36.911
Now let's stick it on the paper.

1:05:40.493 --> 1:05:41.952
That's it.

1:05:45.793 --> 1:05:47.293
A little help would be nice.

1:05:48.066 --> 1:05:49.775
You know I want to.

1:05:49.800 --> 1:05:51.425
Look at that.

1:05:52.375 --> 1:05:54.417
It flies so high!

1:06:01.419 --> 1:06:02.711
Make it go far!

1:06:05.342 --> 1:06:07.008
We're #1!

1:06:07.070 --> 1:06:08.803
Have you done this before?

1:06:10.154 --> 1:06:11.488
You're good!

1:06:14.504 --> 1:06:15.587
No, no!

1:06:20.522 --> 1:06:21.938
That was close!

1:06:35.995 --> 1:06:38.566
Dad! Right here!

1:06:44.609 --> 1:06:46.217
Hurry up!

1:06:52.762 --> 1:06:54.512
You're a good man.

1:06:55.232 --> 1:06:57.357
Yeah right.

1:07:07.115 --> 1:07:08.040
Lady first.

1:07:08.065 --> 1:07:09.898
Thanks.

1:07:13.561 --> 1:07:17.728
You go ahead.
I need to run an errand first.

1:07:18.237 --> 1:07:19.237
Sure.

1:07:21.849 --> 1:07:22.849
See you later.

1:07:44.854 --> 1:07:45.978
Ma'am.

1:07:52.491 --> 1:07:54.199
Why don't you come in?

1:07:54.326 --> 1:08:01.409
I just came to see her, but I can't go in.

1:08:01.840 --> 1:08:06.298
You came all the way. Please come in.

1:08:10.793 --> 1:08:15.043
Is she... dying?

1:08:18.222 --> 1:08:22.597
I can't answer that.

1:08:28.367 --> 1:08:32.659
She needs you now. More than ever.

1:08:34.742 --> 1:08:39.950
I can't. I don't deserve her.

1:08:40.538 --> 1:08:41.663
Ma'am!

1:09:05.157 --> 1:09:06.866
I just wanted to help you.

1:09:06.891 --> 1:09:10.766
I know. You don't have to explain.

1:09:13.751 --> 1:09:15.126
But...

1:09:15.701 --> 1:09:19.909
But you really shouldn't have.

1:09:21.847 --> 1:09:24.013
Then that wouldn't be happened.

1:09:28.608 --> 1:09:33.482
It's not your fault anyway.

1:09:36.146 --> 1:09:42.021
I should've told you that
I've met her already.

1:09:44.532 --> 1:09:46.699
Why didn't you?

1:09:52.248 --> 1:09:56.207
I was ashamed of it, I guess...

1:09:58.853 --> 1:10:04.843
Missing my mom who never came to see me.

1:10:07.076 --> 1:10:11.951
I didn't want to show
that side to others.

1:10:13.992 --> 1:10:18.742
And one day when I grow up...

1:10:20.634 --> 1:10:22.926
I'll go see her...

1:10:23.824 --> 1:10:26.240
I've been just waiting
for the right time.

1:10:36.867 --> 1:10:38.492
Where are you going?

1:10:38.517 --> 1:10:39.767
Going alone?

1:10:48.583 --> 1:10:50.208
Hi. Come in.

1:10:50.725 --> 1:10:53.183
I'll be with you shortly.

1:10:53.638 --> 1:10:58.471
<i>I've found my mother</i>

1:11:00.871 --> 1:11:02.913
<i>after all this time.</i>

1:11:11.191 --> 1:11:12.524
I tried to be brave.

1:11:14.422 --> 1:11:16.173
Please, have a sit.

1:11:43.855 --> 1:11:44.938
Come here.

1:11:58.388 --> 1:12:00.346
Sit here.

1:12:06.019 --> 1:12:07.228
Anything you want?

1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:09.819
Haircut, please.

1:12:10.767 --> 1:12:11.851
Sure.

1:12:18.079 --> 1:12:19.746
Do you live around here?

1:12:20.177 --> 1:12:22.261
No, in Seoul.

1:12:23.232 --> 1:12:24.983
You traveled far...

1:12:31.406 --> 1:12:36.781
I'm Dan Mi-so.

1:12:44.763 --> 1:12:46.805
Sorry if I scared you.

1:12:47.622 --> 1:12:49.830
I wasn't sure at first,

1:12:50.465 --> 1:12:53.173
but just recognize your voice.

1:12:59.004 --> 1:13:03.504
How have you been?
I just turned 25 this year.

1:13:05.142 --> 1:13:08.724
Sorry. You came to the wrong place.

1:13:14.024 --> 1:13:19.893
I don't want to bother you.
I won't even call you mom.

1:13:19.918 --> 1:13:25.849
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm okay...

1:13:25.874 --> 1:13:26.958
I'm sorry.

1:13:27.279 --> 1:13:29.487
But I'm not your mother.

1:17:00.778 --> 1:17:08.487
You asked me if I gave up on my life.

1:17:10.347 --> 1:17:17.222
Yes, I guess you may be right...

1:17:18.566 --> 1:17:19.699
I felt miserable.

1:17:24.541 --> 1:17:29.499
So terrible to be abandoned twice.

1:17:35.802 --> 1:17:40.178
Well, now you know what happened.

1:17:40.996 --> 1:17:43.662
Would that help you?

1:17:47.748 --> 1:17:54.124
It doesn't matter anymore.
I'm off your case now.

1:17:56.541 --> 1:17:58.832
Then we won't see each other often anymore.

1:18:00.718 --> 1:18:03.009
I can get fired too.

1:18:05.426 --> 1:18:09.175
But you know...

1:18:10.134 --> 1:18:12.092
Things could get worse.

1:18:15.479 --> 1:18:16.989
I feel sick...

1:18:18.394 --> 1:18:19.394
What's going on?

1:18:21.076 --> 1:18:22.337
Are you okay?

1:18:30.967 --> 1:18:32.383
Saturation 92.

1:18:32.384 --> 1:18:33.384
Dopamine injection now!

1:18:33.384 --> 1:18:33.883
Yes, sir.

1:18:33.883 --> 1:18:34.467
And more Oxygen.

1:18:34.467 --> 1:18:35.467
Yes.

1:18:35.551 --> 1:18:37.967
It keeps dropping, 89, 88...

1:18:39.509 --> 1:18:41.009
She needs a CPR.

1:18:42.384 --> 1:18:43.841
Sir, you can't be here.

1:18:43.842 --> 1:18:45.091
Dopamine injection.

1:18:45.092 --> 1:18:46.259
Please wait outside.

1:18:46.426 --> 1:18:47.591
What level, Sir?

1:18:47.592 --> 1:18:51.592
20. I need one more Epi. Now!

1:18:55.492 --> 1:18:58.034
Excuse me, what's going on?

1:18:58.059 --> 1:18:59.182
Open the door.

1:18:59.183 --> 1:19:00.683
Oh, my god...

1:19:00.684 --> 1:19:02.892
I'll call the anesthesiology.

1:20:54.640 --> 1:20:59.432
We offered settlements and
will finalize by this weekend.

1:21:01.526 --> 1:21:03.566
I think they'll take the offer.

1:21:03.567 --> 1:21:06.195
I told you so.

1:21:06.255 --> 1:21:08.255
Nothing impossible!

1:21:37.484 --> 1:21:41.234
Mi-so doesn't have much time.

1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:45.747
I know it's hard, but please hear me out.

1:21:52.609 --> 1:21:53.609
Please...

1:21:53.609 --> 1:21:54.609
Mom!

1:23:58.150 --> 1:23:59.150
Wanna smoke?

1:24:13.609 --> 1:24:14.609
You don't look good.

1:24:18.317 --> 1:24:19.900
How is your boy?

1:24:22.109 --> 1:24:25.150
It's not like he can get
better just like that.

1:24:33.275 --> 1:24:35.818
Why didn't you tell me about your son?

1:24:40.442 --> 1:24:42.025
What's the use?

1:24:43.401 --> 1:24:46.983
I should go. My son's waiting.

1:24:55.859 --> 1:24:56.900
Bro!

1:24:59.526 --> 1:25:00.859
Take care of yourself, okay?

1:25:07.776 --> 1:25:09.109
Thank you.

1:26:03.567 --> 1:26:05.109
Her legal guardian?

1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:08.292
Yes, you'll take over all her rights.

1:26:08.317 --> 1:26:11.651
Settlement for accident, trial,

1:26:11.955 --> 1:26:14.371
and collecting the insurance...

1:26:14.536 --> 1:26:16.536
Yes, you'll take over all her rights

1:26:17.729 --> 1:26:20.196
instead of Ho-jung here.

1:26:25.720 --> 1:26:26.720
Excuse me?

1:26:26.942 --> 1:26:31.650
I'm her mother, not a guardian.

1:26:31.651 --> 1:26:33.818
So I don't need these rights.

1:26:38.401 --> 1:26:39.998
Have you lost your mind?

1:26:40.942 --> 1:26:45.109
You're taking care of her,
but you won't sign the paper?

1:26:46.572 --> 1:26:48.864
What if she dies?

1:26:49.976 --> 1:26:53.018
You can't even take care of yourself!

1:26:56.183 --> 1:26:58.434
It was hard for you too.

1:26:58.731 --> 1:27:00.689
You're still struggling.

1:27:25.392 --> 1:27:31.601
You must've hated me.

1:27:35.059 --> 1:27:37.492
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1:27:41.100 --> 1:27:44.132
I owe you an apology.

1:28:37.243 --> 1:28:38.589
Her birth mom?

1:28:38.934 --> 1:28:41.350
Yes, we have Mi-so's birth mom,

1:28:41.375 --> 1:28:43.667
and she's asking for more time.

1:28:43.892 --> 1:28:46.892
We have no choice but accept.

1:28:48.342 --> 1:28:50.342
I don't understand.

1:28:51.665 --> 1:28:54.415
Who found her?

1:28:55.645 --> 1:28:56.645
You?

1:29:07.066 --> 1:29:09.732
You did this, huh?

1:29:10.459 --> 1:29:11.918
Did a great job.

1:29:12.553 --> 1:29:15.929
Finding the mother for a blind orphan.

1:29:16.183 --> 1:29:19.725
Are we what? A charity organization?

1:29:19.726 --> 1:29:21.809
Stop bullshitting!

1:29:27.934 --> 1:29:29.517
What?

1:29:32.395 --> 1:29:35.634
Sir, it's not a 'blind'.

1:29:36.349 --> 1:29:39.294
It's 'visually impaired'.

1:29:59.606 --> 1:30:01.689
It's not safe over there.

1:30:15.257 --> 1:30:16.965
Not scared huh?

1:30:18.118 --> 1:30:19.285
Not really.

1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:27.863
Well, maybe a little.

1:30:28.389 --> 1:30:32.973
That's good. I hate pretending.

1:30:41.159 --> 1:30:45.034
The sky at this time
is the most beautiful.

1:30:45.332 --> 1:30:46.518
Yeah.

1:30:50.878 --> 1:30:54.045
When I couldn't see, I would've
given everything for these.

1:30:56.384 --> 1:30:59.217
It's great I can see like this.

1:31:00.257 --> 1:31:02.095
But now,

1:31:04.350 --> 1:31:09.824
I miss the old time.

1:31:13.535 --> 1:31:17.684
Why? Isn't it good to be with your mom?

1:31:21.918 --> 1:31:25.661
Of course it's good, but...

1:31:27.777 --> 1:31:30.360
I can't do anything for her.

1:31:32.150 --> 1:31:35.595
I can't even wipe her tears...

1:31:37.145 --> 1:31:42.686
The longer I hold on,
it'll be harder for her.

1:31:43.975 --> 1:31:49.163
So rather than watching her suffer...

1:31:50.474 --> 1:31:54.641
It's better if I let go now.

1:31:58.311 --> 1:32:03.731
I'm leaving here anyway...

1:32:05.481 --> 1:32:10.746
I don't want the people I love to suffer.

1:32:11.428 --> 1:32:13.845
What are you talking about?

1:32:19.738 --> 1:32:21.447
I need your help.

1:32:23.575 --> 1:32:24.867
Are you out of your mind?

1:32:26.226 --> 1:32:32.309
I know it's hard, but you can do this.

1:32:33.775 --> 1:32:35.109
For me...

1:32:36.277 --> 1:32:40.194
No, I can't.

1:32:41.324 --> 1:32:44.157
You're the only one who can help.

1:32:48.618 --> 1:32:55.673
Help me leave before it gets too tough.

1:33:01.090 --> 1:33:02.591
I can't.

1:33:09.173 --> 1:33:10.756
I won't.

1:33:21.207 --> 1:33:22.878
Okay...

1:33:25.636 --> 1:33:27.636
I understand...

1:33:31.094 --> 1:33:32.107
No.

1:33:35.235 --> 1:33:36.904
You can't.

1:33:38.742 --> 1:33:40.678
Ever.

1:33:52.181 --> 1:33:55.219
Sun-hwa, are you okay?

1:33:55.564 --> 1:34:00.861
<i>I never thought that
it would ever happen to me.</i>

1:34:06.309 --> 1:34:10.313
<i>Honey, I'm sorry.</i>

1:34:12.739 --> 1:34:14.562
<i>What're you talking about?</i>

1:34:15.410 --> 1:34:17.677
There's nothing to worry.

1:34:18.707 --> 1:34:20.457
Never say that again.

1:34:48.351 --> 1:34:49.850
Be honest.

1:34:51.683 --> 1:34:53.642
Don't you ever wish I should be dead?

1:34:54.476 --> 1:34:56.059
No, never.

1:34:56.518 --> 1:34:58.725
I can see it on your face.

1:34:58.758 --> 1:35:03.055
You want me to be gone!

1:35:10.184 --> 1:35:16.809
<i>It was scared to see how
illness changes people.</i>

1:35:22.683 --> 1:35:24.683
One cigarette won't kill me.

1:35:24.708 --> 1:35:27.374
Give it back, now!

1:35:29.892 --> 1:35:32.442
<i>Why should I go through this?</i>

1:35:36.226 --> 1:35:38.561
<i>I became helpless.</i>

1:35:46.683 --> 1:35:50.476
Hun, can we go see an ocean?

1:36:07.184 --> 1:36:13.017
<i>I just want everything to be ended.</i>

1:36:15.222 --> 1:36:17.346
- Honey...
- Yes?

1:36:18.017 --> 1:36:19.017
I'm cold.

1:36:19.967 --> 1:36:21.575
Can you get me a blanket?

1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:22.600
Sure.

1:36:25.809 --> 1:36:27.785
I'll be back soon.

1:36:49.468 --> 1:36:51.089
Where did she go?

1:36:56.762 --> 1:36:58.512
God...

1:37:34.351 --> 1:37:35.433
Sir, please.

1:37:35.434 --> 1:37:36.059
Excuse me.

1:37:36.060 --> 1:37:37.391
Please wait here.

1:37:37.392 --> 1:37:38.975
She was bleeding too much.

1:38:24.725 --> 1:38:30.832
<i>I saw you there for the first time.</i>

1:38:48.326 --> 1:38:53.029
The last moment would be more
memorable than the first, right?

1:38:55.853 --> 1:38:57.395
This is...

1:38:58.900 --> 1:39:03.316
where I wanted to be, at the last moment.

1:39:16.743 --> 1:39:19.724
Will you remember me?

1:39:23.331 --> 1:39:24.710
Stop it.

1:39:29.980 --> 1:39:31.813
Promise,

1:39:34.475 --> 1:39:36.475
that you'll remember me.

1:39:38.881 --> 1:39:40.672
I don't wanna hear it.

1:40:02.415 --> 1:40:06.666
It'll be sad, if no one remembers.

1:40:13.300 --> 1:40:15.803
We've done this before, right?

1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:24.365
This way, you won't forget.

1:41:40.746 --> 1:41:44.579
Now, you won't forget, right?

1:41:49.394 --> 1:41:50.394
How...

1:41:52.672 --> 1:41:54.672
how can I forget you?

1:41:55.692 --> 1:42:01.068
I meant, as our happy memories.

1:42:10.141 --> 1:42:13.323
I know it was hard for you.

1:42:14.263 --> 1:42:19.303
I just wanted to leave
good memories to you.

1:42:20.732 --> 1:42:22.732
I am sorry.

1:42:24.657 --> 1:42:27.182
No, Sun-hwa.

1:42:27.224 --> 1:42:29.224
I am sorry.

1:50:49.699 --> 1:50:56.444
ONE DAY
