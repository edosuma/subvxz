[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:04.714 --> 00:08.172
- Hugo, you can go back to your camp.
- What about my friends?

00:08.259 --> 00:12.719
Your job is to tell the rest of your
people they can never come here.

00:13.139 --> 00:15.755
Rest in peace, Mr. Eko.

00:17.810 --> 00:20.552
And thank you for helping me find my...

00:25.735 --> 00:27.475
I don't care what Jack said.

00:27.570 --> 00:30.482
They've got him and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

00:30.573 --> 00:33.656
The Pearl is a monitoring station

00:33.743 --> 00:37.531
where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects

00:37.622 --> 00:39.533
can be observed and recorded.

00:40.917 --> 00:42.248
[gasps]

00:46.464 --> 00:48.625
I guess he'll be expecting us.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.512
[woman] To the left of it.
Put it over there.

01:05.316 --> 01:08.683
A Ping-Pong table?
Where'd the hell that come from?

01:08.778 --> 01:11.565
Jin found it when he was out
looking for firewood.

01:11.656 --> 01:14.398
We made legs for it and paddles.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.153
Now all we need is a ball.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.780
Found it?

01:17.870 --> 01:20.737
Must have landed in the jungle
when the hatch exploded.

01:20.831 --> 01:24.323
- I thought the hatch collapsed.
- All I know is the sky turned purple.

01:24.418 --> 01:28.707
After that I don't ask questions.
| just make myself a salad and move on.

01:28.798 --> 01:30.834
Yeah, I can see that's working for you.

01:30.925 --> 01:33.758
Hey, you seen Kate around?

01:33.844 --> 01:35.926
Wow, she's not back yet?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.719
Hmm.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.764
You guys find anything
we can use for a ball?

01:40.851 --> 01:42.182
[man] No.

01:43.354 --> 01:46.517
Hey, that's my Guns and Ammo.
Where the hell did you get it?

01:46.607 --> 01:49.098
It was in the magazine stack.

01:49.193 --> 01:51.479
We share things now.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.528
Listen, Zorro, it was in my stuff.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.698
Stuff you decided to party with
while you thought I was dead.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.993
Listen, hillbilly,
if you want it that bad, take it.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.499
Just keep it.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.312
We need to eat.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.813
Are we still on course?

02:35.781 --> 02:39.524
We're still heading north
on a bearing of three-zero-five.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.325
- Yes.
- l'm sensing a lack of confidence.

02:42.413 --> 02:45.075
We've been walking for two days
following a bearing

02:45.166 --> 02:47.327
provided by the carvings on a stick.

02:47.418 --> 02:51.286
- And?
- We're going to chance upon the Others?

02:51.380 --> 02:54.543
I don't know what we're going
to chance on, Sayid, but...

02:54.633 --> 02:58.000
...my bearing is
the only bearing we've got.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.718
I'm going to find some fruit.

03:03.100 --> 03:07.013
Then we're going to have a rational
conversation regarding our next move.

03:16.947 --> 03:20.906
[distant clanging]

03:24.580 --> 03:27.822
[clanging continues]

03:47.895 --> 03:49.806
- [whistling]
- [gun cocking]

03:57.113 --> 03:59.729
[mooing]

04:45.369 --> 04:47.951
You all looking for something...
like this?

04:48.164 --> 04:49.654
Cool, a ball.

04:50.124 --> 04:54.083
Ah-ah-ah. We need to do
a little quid pro quo first.

04:54.170 --> 04:58.914
I've been gone, you thought the store
was having a going-out-of—business sale,

04:59.008 --> 05:01.590
but now I'm back
and I want what's mine.

05:01.677 --> 05:04.134
Yeah, but it wasn't
really yours to begin with.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.553
A, It was mine when I took it.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.598
B, Who the hell are you?

05:09.685 --> 05:13.769
And C, Because I'm fair,
I'm going to let you play me for it.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.805
Play Ping-Pong?

05:16.901 --> 05:20.644
That's right, Avalanche.
You bastards put up your best player.

05:20.738 --> 05:22.103
One game.

05:22.198 --> 05:23.779
And when l crush them,

05:23.866 --> 05:26.699
you all got to bring me
every piece of my stash back.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.364
If you lose?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.241
I ain't gonna lose, but...

05:33.584 --> 05:35.495
...ifldo...

05:35.586 --> 05:38.123
...tell you what, name it.

05:40.758 --> 05:44.626
[speaking Korean]

05:46.222 --> 05:51.216
Ooh. Looks like Crouching Tiger
and Hidden Dragon got something good.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.680
Lay it on me.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.099
No nicknames.

05:56.941 --> 06:00.980
If you lose,
no nicknames for anyone.

06:01.070 --> 06:03.186
For a week.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.271
Nice.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.900
You're on.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.782
Pick your player.
I'll be back in an hour,

06:12.873 --> 06:15.205
then let the slaughter begin.

06:20.673 --> 06:23.210
[Locke] Are you sure
it's completely isolated?

06:24.260 --> 06:26.091
l've circled the house.

06:26.178 --> 06:29.636
There's nothing but jungle
surrounding it. Here.

06:32.977 --> 06:34.558
[Locke] That dish still work?

06:34.645 --> 06:37.728
A dish of that size would have
broadcasting capabilities

06:37.815 --> 06:39.806
of thousands of miles.

06:40.442 --> 06:43.900
Danielle, you once mentioned
a radio tower.

06:43.988 --> 06:47.196
- Is this it?
- l have never been here before.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.362
The man in the house,
seen him before?

06:51.453 --> 06:53.660
On a video feed
from the Pearl Station.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.248
- So who is he?
- Only one way to find out.

07:00.838 --> 07:03.750
- We ask him.
- What's this for?

07:03.841 --> 07:07.675
If I'm unarmed,
he won't feel threatened.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.673
In case he is threatened,
you can cover me from here.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.426
Hey, where are you going?

07:13.517 --> 07:16.850
l have no interest
in that man inside the house.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.473
l have survived on the island

07:18.564 --> 07:22.056
precisely by avoiding
these types of encounters.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.605
I'll wait for you by the stream.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.936
For those of you who survive.

07:42.212 --> 07:46.376
- [Arabic music plays]
- [men chattering in Arabic]

07:51.889 --> 07:54.175
Najeev. Najeev.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.009
[speaks Arabic]

07:59.647 --> 08:02.013
[people chattering]

08:09.740 --> 08:12.777
- Did you cook this?
- Yes. I did.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.243
Well, it's delicious.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.288
My name is Sami.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.660
Najeev. Thank you.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.454
Please, sit. Sit.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.500
So where are you from, Najeev?

08:27.591 --> 08:30.253
- I'm Syrian.
- Please.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.719
[speaks Arabic]

08:41.397 --> 08:42.933
What do you want from me?

08:43.232 --> 08:45.974
You're an excellent cook.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.810
And I... l have a restaurant...

08:48.904 --> 08:50.735
...much nicer than this place.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.862
Come take a look.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.862
If you like it, I will hire you

08:55.953 --> 08:58.535
at twice your pay here.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.659
You're offering a stranger a job
because of a single meal?

09:01.750 --> 09:03.331
I'm offering you a job

09:03.419 --> 09:05.910
because we are outsiders here.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.333
And because, uh...
my chefjust quit.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.527
[whinnies quietly]

09:48.505 --> 09:50.416
- [gunfire]
- [grunting]

09:52.801 --> 09:55.838
- No, he's been hit.
- Not yet. You want to get shot too?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.716
I didn't cross the line!
We had a truce.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.923
This is my land.
You said I could stay here.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.976
No. lam not who you think I am!

10:04.062 --> 10:06.223
My name is Sayid Jarrah.

10:06.315 --> 10:09.022
l was on a plane
that crashed here months ago.

10:11.028 --> 10:14.316
- A plane?
- l'm unarmed. I swear.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.282
Stay right there.

10:30.631 --> 10:31.746
[gunfire]

10:31.840 --> 10:34.297
Drop the rifle!
Drop it right now!

10:34.718 --> 10:36.834
Back up. Back up.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.470
Are you all right?

10:45.312 --> 10:47.098
You really did crash here?

10:47.189 --> 10:49.931
Over 40 of us, yes.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.441
I'll go in first, make sure it's OK.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.270
Who are you?

10:56.365 --> 10:58.321
My name is Mikhail Bakunin.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.868
And I am the last living member
of the Dharma Initiative.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.619
Watch your step.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.000
[groaning]

11:15.092 --> 11:16.832
Please.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.131
Sit.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.513
Here, let me.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.806
You've had experience
treating gunshot wounds?

11:27.896 --> 11:30.512
[Mikhail] I spent some time
in Afghanistan.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.937
I had experience with field
medicine in the Soviet Army.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.821
In the kitchen on the top shelf
there is a medical kit.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.024
Will you bring it, please?

11:42.911 --> 11:45.118
It's all right, Kate.

11:53.589 --> 11:57.707
- How did you get here?
- I almost don't know where to begin.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.588
Why don't you begin
with the Dharma Initiative?

12:01.138 --> 12:04.847
[Mikhail] I grew up in Kiev
and joined the Soviet Army.

12:04.933 --> 12:08.471
l was stationed at
a listening post in Vladivostok.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.475
After the Cold War...

12:12.941 --> 12:14.727
...after we lost the Cold War,

12:14.818 --> 12:16.683
my unit was decommissioned.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.650
l was dismissed
from my life in the military.

12:20.741 --> 12:25.986
And after years of conducting
unpleasant actions against our enemies,

12:26.955 --> 12:29.913
I found myself wanting
to do something good.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.833
So I replied to
a newspaper advertisement.

12:32.920 --> 12:37.334
- An advertisement?
- "Would you like to save the world?"

12:37.966 --> 12:40.252
That's how I met them. The Initiative.

12:40.344 --> 12:44.838
Very secretive. Very rich.
And very smart.

12:45.933 --> 12:49.425
- So when did you come to the island?
- Eleven years now.

12:49.519 --> 12:53.979
I liked computers,
communications equipment,

12:54.066 --> 12:56.603
and being alone,
like a lighthouse keeper.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.602
So they put me in this station.

12:59.696 --> 13:03.405
- They called it "the Flame."
- What's the purpose of the Flame?

13:04.493 --> 13:07.200
To communicate with
the outside world, of course.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.073
[computer melody plays]

13:13.168 --> 13:15.500
[computer voice] Ready to play?

13:17.506 --> 13:19.087
[melody plays]

13:19.174 --> 13:20.880
Ready to play?

13:31.561 --> 13:33.062
Your move.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.608
What happened
to the Dharma Initiative?

13:41.238 --> 13:43.024
They're all dead, of course.

13:43.365 --> 13:47.108
They foolishly initiated a war
against the Hostiles.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.944
A "purge," they called it.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.154
And how did you survive this purge?

13:53.834 --> 13:56.576
By not participating in it.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.412
I told you, I like being alone.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.748
And the Hostiles
allowed you to stay here?

14:03.427 --> 14:06.760
After it was over,
four men appeared in the yard.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.888
They offered a truce.

14:09.975 --> 14:13.467
They said to imagine a line that
extended all the way around the valley.

14:13.562 --> 14:17.225
As long as I did not cross it,
I would be left alone.

14:20.110 --> 14:23.443
Then they took two cows
and I never saw them again.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.695
They weren't interested in the dish?

14:25.782 --> 14:29.491
Why would they be?
It hasn't functioned for years.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.698
Who are they, these Hostiles?

14:32.789 --> 14:34.871
I do not know.

14:34.958 --> 14:38.075
But they were here
for a long time before we were.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.748
A very long time.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.330
[groans]

14:44.426 --> 14:46.462
[woman laughing]

14:52.476 --> 14:55.183
[Arabic music playing]

14:55.270 --> 14:58.637
[men chattering in Arabic]

15:05.322 --> 15:06.732
I'm looking for Sami.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.736
Sami!

15:11.661 --> 15:14.949
Najeev, I am so glad you came.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.082
What do you think?
It's a simple place, as you can see,

15:19.169 --> 15:21.205
but we have good customers.

15:22.339 --> 15:26.173
Ah, here's my wife.
She's in charge of the kitchen.

15:28.637 --> 15:31.094
Amira, come meet Najeev.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.773
Pleasure to meet you.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.185
Are you sure this is him?

15:46.738 --> 15:48.399
Yes.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.022
Look, I don't know
who you think I am.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.707
[grunting]

16:08.301 --> 16:10.838
[panting]

16:22.482 --> 16:24.063
[speaks Russian]

16:25.026 --> 16:26.641
What did you just say?

16:26.736 --> 16:29.443
I told Nadia to be polite
because you are my guests.

16:29.531 --> 16:30.941
- Nadia?
- Mmm.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.569
After Nadia Comaneci,

16:33.660 --> 16:36.117
the greatest athlete
the world has ever known.

16:37.706 --> 16:39.287
We have the same birthday.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.491
What?

16:43.753 --> 16:46.620
[speaks Russian]

16:48.425 --> 16:51.007
Excellent work, if I say myself.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.214
Thank you, Mikhail.

16:53.305 --> 16:57.514
Perhaps I can begin to earn your
forgiveness by offering some iced tea?

16:57.601 --> 16:59.762
I will also check on your friend.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.360
[door opens]

17:14.451 --> 17:16.988
[chuckles] Don't waste your time.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.364
For ten years I've tried
to defeat that game,

17:19.456 --> 17:22.038
but it was programmed
by three grand masters.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.535
And it cheats.

17:23.627 --> 17:26.118
- Hmm.
- Ready to play?

17:26.213 --> 17:30.707
I've played computers and I'm pretty
sure they don't know how to cheat.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.758
That's what makes
being human so distinctly...

17:34.930 --> 17:37.012
- ...wonderful.
- [melody plays]

17:37.098 --> 17:38.634
Your move.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.687
What's wrong?

17:49.778 --> 17:52.941
It just... It doesn't make any sense.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.523
Why would they let him stay here...
with all this stuff?

17:56.618 --> 17:59.735
- All this equipment?
- Actually it makes perfect sense.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.330
What are you talking about?

18:01.414 --> 18:04.702
The reason they let him stay here
is because he is not Dharma.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.376
He is one of them.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.422
He shot you and you just let him...?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.630
Why are we still sitting here?

18:20.725 --> 18:24.764
We are sitting here, Kate,
because I am certain he is not alone.

18:39.661 --> 18:40.992
So...

18:41.621 --> 18:44.488
...you really the number one
draft pick, Grimace?

18:45.041 --> 18:46.372
Yep.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.285
- Are we playing with the mercy rule?
- Mercy rule?

18:50.380 --> 18:54.999
Yeah, like if I'm up 11-0,
then I, you know,

18:55.093 --> 18:56.674
automatically win.

18:57.345 --> 19:01.384
- You're gonna go up 11-0?
- No, I mean either one of us.

19:03.101 --> 19:05.934
Sure. We can have a mercy rule.

19:07.022 --> 19:10.230
- You want to volley for serve?
- I'll tell you what.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.150
- Be my guest.
- Take him down, Hurley.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.567
- [cheering]
- [clapping]

19:14.654 --> 19:15.985
[woman] Go for it.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.278
Come on, Hurley.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.230
Zero serving zero.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.076
Yes!

19:28.501 --> 19:29.911
One-nothing.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.345
I grow the tea myself.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.969
So pardon its bitterness.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.547
Any tea is good tea.

19:43.641 --> 19:46.678
You know how long it's been
since we've seen ice?

19:47.937 --> 19:51.976
I noticed a series of thick wires
as I walked around the station.

19:52.067 --> 19:56.527
This is the hub, but they go underground
to various stations all over the island.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.275
And these cables, do any of them
run into the ocean?

19:59.366 --> 20:03.075
Yes, there is an underwater beacon
that emits sonar pings

20:03.161 --> 20:04.697
to help guide in the vessels.

20:04.788 --> 20:08.155
- By vessels, you mean submarines?
- Yes.

20:08.249 --> 20:10.865
The Initiative used one
to bring us here.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.542
But I can imagine only
that the Hostiles have either

20:13.630 --> 20:15.541
destroyed or commandeered it by now.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.749
That explains how they were able
to get around my position

20:18.843 --> 20:23.177
- and capture our sailboat.
- You had a sailboat?

20:23.264 --> 20:26.392
Until we lost it to your Hostiles.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.758
That's very unfortunate.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.054
Well...

20:32.148 --> 20:34.355
...at least we were able
to kill one of them.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.237
Why are we continuing
to play this little game...

20:47.622 --> 20:50.705
...when we all know it has
moved to the next stage?

21:11.187 --> 21:12.893
[gun cocking]

21:13.523 --> 21:14.808
[grunting]

21:20.405 --> 21:21.611
Get some rope.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.278
[door opens]

21:28.621 --> 21:30.157
[door slams]

21:45.221 --> 21:46.552
Drink.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.485
You were a torturer, were you not?

22:02.572 --> 22:04.312
In the Republican Guard.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.066
Do you not recognize...

22:08.745 --> 22:10.827
...one of your victims?

22:10.914 --> 22:14.281
Do you not recognize
the woman that you tortured?

22:14.375 --> 22:16.661
Do you not recognize my wife?

22:16.753 --> 22:18.459
No. I've never seen...

22:21.424 --> 22:24.507
You've confused me with someone else.

22:29.599 --> 22:33.808
Amira was arrested for harboring
an enemy of the state.

22:35.688 --> 22:40.102
She was held for three months
while she was questioned.

22:44.072 --> 22:47.610
Her arms bear the scars
of those questions.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.952
So I assure you, Najeev,
I am not confused.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.494
- My name is not Najeev.
- Hmm.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.750
I'm Sayid Jarrah.

23:04.133 --> 23:07.717
I was in the Republican Guard
and, yes, lwas an interrogator,

23:07.804 --> 23:10.170
but I have never seen your wife.

23:10.265 --> 23:13.507
Maybe she saw me at the same facility,
but I do not know her!

23:15.395 --> 23:19.229
I can remember every face
of every person I've interrogated.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.647
She remembers your face.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.563
She remembers it so well

23:27.657 --> 23:30.899
that she recognized it
from a mere glimpse

23:30.994 --> 23:33.656
when we walked by the restaurant
where you worked!

23:44.799 --> 23:46.915
What do you want from me?

23:47.010 --> 23:49.672
I want you to admit to what you did.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.303
And if you don't...

23:54.017 --> 23:56.383
...you will leave this room
in that bag.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.361
How do you know he isn't alone?

24:09.449 --> 24:11.440
The horse outside is still saddled,

24:11.534 --> 24:14.742
and the stirrups are set up
for someone shorter than this man.

24:15.246 --> 24:18.033
You think the Others
sent someone to keep him company?

24:18.124 --> 24:21.708
They sent someone out here
because they lost communications.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.581
Maybe when the sky turned purple?

24:24.672 --> 24:26.208
That would be my guess.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.756
If someone's here,
they're hiding good.

24:28.843 --> 24:32.131
I checked every nook
and cranny of this place.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.557
Not every nook and cranny, John.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.562
[door opens]

24:45.568 --> 24:47.559
[door slams]

25:08.424 --> 25:10.335
Are you ready to tell me the truth?

25:10.426 --> 25:13.463
I have told you the truth.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.264
I do not know you.

25:20.061 --> 25:21.221
You tortured her.

25:24.273 --> 25:27.515
No, I would never touch a woman.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.862
Do you think this will do any good?

25:36.953 --> 25:40.161
That this will make me confess
to something I didn't do?

25:40.248 --> 25:42.910
My wife confessed to something
she didn't do.

25:43.418 --> 25:47.536
She confessed when you poured
a pan of boiling oil over her arms.

25:47.630 --> 25:50.042
- No. I did not. You have the wrong...
- Admit it!

25:52.301 --> 25:54.041
Admit it!

25:54.137 --> 25:56.753
I cannot admit
to something I didn't do.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.227
That is enough for today.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.696
Then I will see you tomorrow.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.002
[door opens]

26:52.445 --> 26:54.857
- [melody plays]
- Your move.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.455
- [melody plays]
- Your move.

27:17.595 --> 27:19.836
- What is it?
- C-4.

27:20.932 --> 27:22.843
Explosive.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.182
- The whole place is wired.
- Why?

27:30.024 --> 27:31.639
I don't know.

27:33.486 --> 27:37.024
- [melody plays]
- Your move.

27:44.038 --> 27:46.620
- [melody plays]
- Your move.

28:39.343 --> 28:42.050
- [melody plays]
- Your move.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.643
[victorious melody]

29:00.323 --> 29:02.154
Manual override achieved.

29:02.742 --> 29:05.199
For pallet drop, enter two-four.

29:05.828 --> 29:08.444
For station uplink, enter three-two.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.073
For mainland communication,
enter three-eight.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.757
The satellite dish is inoperable.

29:22.845 --> 29:25.757
Communications are down.

29:26.182 --> 29:29.174
For sonar access, enter ﬁve-six.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.312
Sonar is inoperable.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.945
Has there been an incursion
on this station by the Hostiles?

29:43.032 --> 29:46.195
If so, enter seven-seven.

29:51.958 --> 29:55.871
Keep your voice low
and your hands in front of you.

30:20.695 --> 30:22.401
[screams]

30:23.823 --> 30:26.656
- [gun cocking]
- Stop right there.

30:29.662 --> 30:32.404
Put the gun on the ground... now.

30:35.710 --> 30:37.371
[gun clatters]

30:45.344 --> 30:47.801
- What are you doing?
- It's her.

30:48.681 --> 30:50.842
She was there!
She was at the dock!

30:50.933 --> 30:53.345
She was there when we were kidnapped.

30:53.436 --> 30:55.097
She knows where Jack is.

31:00.943 --> 31:03.650
Are there any more of you here?

31:10.870 --> 31:12.735
Let's take her upstairs.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.947
John, we're coming up.

31:19.045 --> 31:21.457
-John!
- [Locke] Out here.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.293
Move.

31:33.476 --> 31:36.809
This is simple. Send her over to me
and lwill release him.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.979
- Then we'll go our separate ways.
- Don't listen to him.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.728
- If he's gonna kill me, I'd be dead.
- Shut your mouth.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.854
- Listen to me.
- Sayid, do not let her go.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.231
- I will execute you.
- He's not going to do it.

31:47.323 --> 31:49.359
- Quiet, John.
- I'm keeping him alive.

31:49.450 --> 31:51.406
- Mikhail!
- Calm down, everyone!

31:51.494 --> 31:53.860
[both speaking Russian]

31:53.954 --> 31:55.865
- Sayid.
- I'll handle this, John.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.412
John.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.832
[continue in Russian]

32:01.879 --> 32:03.494
Don't let her talk to him!

32:04.173 --> 32:05.208
Mikhail!

32:06.425 --> 32:08.381
- Stop!
- Just do it, Mikhail!

32:13.474 --> 32:15.590
-John!
- [gunfire]

32:15.684 --> 32:16.719
[both groan]

32:20.815 --> 32:22.225
Finish it!

32:25.528 --> 32:27.018
Kill me.

32:42.503 --> 32:44.664
Oh, come on.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.625
Sorry I beat you so bad, dude.

32:47.716 --> 32:49.923
Sorry you hustled me, you mean.

32:50.511 --> 32:53.218
My mom had a table in her basement.

32:53.305 --> 32:58.174
And I played a lot at the institu...
this place I hung out for awhile.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.770
- I got kind of good.
- Hooray for you.

33:04.066 --> 33:08.901
Doesn't look like that last slam caused
any long-term damage to your forehead.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.070
You got three points, better than zero.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.988
Something you want?

33:13.075 --> 33:15.532
I came to give you back
some of your stuff.

33:16.162 --> 33:19.279
'Cause we know you're
the kind of guy that needs stuff.

33:19.915 --> 33:21.166
You a shrink now?

33:22.918 --> 33:24.499
She'll be OK, dude.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.005
Kate.

33:27.089 --> 33:30.252
I know you're worried about her,
but she's with Locke and Sayid.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.926
- She's going to be fine.
- Yeah, thanks for the pep talk, Lump...

33:34.013 --> 33:35.503
Uh-uh, dude.

33:36.265 --> 33:39.553
It's Hurley... or Hugo, if you want.

33:43.856 --> 33:45.346
Get bent, Hugo.

33:48.444 --> 33:51.311
[victorious melody playing]

33:52.990 --> 33:54.400
You ready to go, Locke?

33:55.367 --> 33:57.107
[Locke] I'll be there in a minute.

33:59.121 --> 34:02.864
Has there been an incursion
on this station by the Hostiles?

34:02.958 --> 34:06.951
If so, enter seven-seven.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.927
Danielle! Danielle!

34:17.640 --> 34:19.596
Tell me something,

34:19.683 --> 34:22.891
were you ever a member
of the Dharma Initiative

34:22.978 --> 34:25.264
or was everything you said a lie?

34:26.023 --> 34:28.435
Of course I'm wasting my breath.

34:28.567 --> 34:32.526
I was never a member, but
everything else I told you was true.

34:32.613 --> 34:34.729
I moved into the station
after the purge.

34:34.823 --> 34:37.815
The purge, a group of
scientists attacked your people.

34:37.910 --> 34:40.868
Believe what you want,
but that is what happened.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.155
Your friends, did he kill them?

34:44.250 --> 34:48.084
No. They're collecting whatever
may be useful from the farmhouse.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.912
And now we have our ticket
to where the Others live.

34:51.006 --> 34:53.748
Where we'll find your daughter and Jack.

34:53.842 --> 34:57.175
And finally, perhaps, a way home.

34:57.721 --> 35:01.930
There is nothing you could do to me
that would make me lead you there.

35:04.144 --> 35:07.352
I didn't say
you were our ticket, did I?

35:15.197 --> 35:18.610
This is a map showing
electrical and data cabling,

35:18.701 --> 35:21.613
running from the Flame, here,

35:21.704 --> 35:24.821
to a place called The Barracks, here.

35:24.915 --> 35:28.453
It's comprised of houses,
dormitories with water and power,

35:28.544 --> 35:31.286
large enough to accommodate
an entire community.

35:33.007 --> 35:36.591
Sounds like a place
well worth visiting, don't you think?

35:37.469 --> 35:40.677
There will come a time
when your guard is down.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.470
And when it is,

35:42.558 --> 35:45.095
I will not hesitate a moment
before killing you.

35:48.063 --> 35:51.772
- You should know this before you...
- He's making an excellent point.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.976
You have a map.
Why keep him alive?

36:02.077 --> 36:03.658
[door opens]

36:06.206 --> 36:07.787
[door slams]

36:22.931 --> 36:27.391
After my husband and I
first arrived to Paris,

36:27.478 --> 36:30.436
I was afraid to ever leave
our apartment.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.816
So I would stare out the window
into the alley...

36:36.820 --> 36:40.062
...and I would see this cat
looking for scraps.

36:40.783 --> 36:44.025
One day some children
came into the alley

36:44.119 --> 36:45.950
and trapped it in a box.

36:46.747 --> 36:49.580
I watched them light firecrackers...

36:51.543 --> 36:53.659
...and drop them in the box.

36:55.214 --> 36:58.706
I could hear him how!
from three stories above.

37:01.595 --> 37:06.134
So finally, I had a reason
to leave my apartment.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.008
I rescued this cat,

37:10.104 --> 37:12.390
and I brought him home.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.184
He sits with me when I read.

37:16.819 --> 37:18.775
He sleeps with me...

37:21.407 --> 37:22.988
...and he purrs.

37:23.075 --> 37:25.657
[purring]

37:26.662 --> 37:28.152
But...

37:28.789 --> 37:30.825
...every once in a while

37:30.916 --> 37:33.783
he will bite me or scratch me.

37:38.090 --> 37:40.251
He does this...

37:40.342 --> 37:42.924
...because sometimes

37:43.011 --> 37:45.502
he forgets that he is safe now.

37:46.390 --> 37:49.678
So I forgive him
when he bites me...

37:51.353 --> 37:55.096
...because I know what it is like

37:55.190 --> 37:57.351
to never feel safe.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.940
And that is because of you.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.530
So today...

38:09.872 --> 38:12.614
...I ask only one thing of you.

38:15.294 --> 38:17.376
I ask you now,

38:17.463 --> 38:19.875
that you show me the respect

38:19.965 --> 38:23.207
of acknowledging
what you did to me.

38:25.053 --> 38:28.545
That it was you who questioned me...

38:29.141 --> 38:31.928
...that tortured me...

38:32.728 --> 38:35.435
...and that you remember me.

38:50.746 --> 38:53.112
I remember you.

38:56.919 --> 38:59.376
I remember your face.

39:01.423 --> 39:05.416
Your face has haunted me
ever since I left Iraq.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.359
[whimpering] I am sorry.

39:26.323 --> 39:30.111
I am so sorry for what I did to you.

39:31.328 --> 39:33.614
I am so sorry.

39:41.964 --> 39:43.329
I forgive you.

39:49.179 --> 39:51.465
When my husband returns,

39:52.182 --> 39:55.470
I will tell him
I made a terrible mistake.

39:57.646 --> 39:59.182
That it was not you.

40:02.359 --> 40:04.145
And he will release you.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.238
VVhy?

40:08.615 --> 40:11.277
Why are you letting me go?

40:11.952 --> 40:16.412
We are all capable of doing
what those children did to this cat.

40:19.501 --> 40:21.583
But I will not do that.

40:21.670 --> 40:24.286
I will not be that.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.508
[Danielle] We should kill him, Sayid.

40:38.604 --> 40:41.061
He already told us
that he would kill us.

40:47.738 --> 40:49.148
No.

40:50.824 --> 40:54.658
He's my prisoner.
I will decide his fate.

41:00.417 --> 41:03.284
I can see you didn't find
anything worth taking.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.960
Actually, ljust played
that chess game again.

41:06.048 --> 41:09.381
And now I realize
why you didn't want me to beat it.

41:12.304 --> 41:13.794
Meaning what?

41:23.315 --> 41:25.772
What have you done, John?

41:25.859 --> 41:29.147
That was our one hope of communication
with the outside world!

41:29.237 --> 41:32.365
The computer said if there was
an incursion by the Hostiles,

41:32.449 --> 41:34.485
I should enter seven-seven.

41:34.576 --> 41:36.612
So I entered seven-seven.

41:44.378 --> 41:45.413
We should go.
