WEBVTT

00:06.982 --> 00:09.151
-Step down.
-Go.

00:15.032 --> 00:17.034
Go ahead and open it up.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.208
Up there.

00:36.846 --> 00:39.640
Tell me this has not been
just a total waste of my time, trooper.

00:39.974 --> 00:43.436
There's something up here, sir.
l'm just not exactly sure what it is.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.314
You promised us bodies.

00:47.982 --> 00:49.817
One thing at a time, warden.

00:49.984 --> 00:52.820
First we start with my souvenirs.

00:53.028 --> 00:54.864
- Souvenirs?
- When l was sick.

00:57.408 --> 00:59.285
- Are you all right?
- l'm all right.

00:59.493 --> 01:03.330
They were my favourite sexual organs.
Tongues.

01:04.956 --> 01:06.292
Where are the girls?

01:07.376 --> 01:08.419
Close.

01:08.627 --> 01:11.046
But you have to give me
something in return for them.

01:11.213 --> 01:13.257
The only thing you're gonna get
is your last meal.

01:13.466 --> 01:16.927
- Take that animal back to death row.
- What about the victims' families?

01:17.136 --> 01:18.637
l'm their last chance for closure.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.598
- What is it you want?
- Not much.

01:21.474 --> 01:22.975
Just the man who put me in these.

01:23.184 --> 01:28.564
NClS Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.859
l will never forget the day
Gibbs caught this psycho.

02:15.444 --> 02:17.363
You knew Gibbs back then?

02:17.780 --> 02:21.283
No. l was a junior at Georgetown
and for two years,

02:21.492 --> 02:23.744
every woman in D.C.
was afraid to go out at night.

02:23.953 --> 02:26.831
- That must have been tough.
- Yeah. You have no idea.

02:27.039 --> 02:30.626
l actually owe Gibbs for the first
full night of sleep l got in college.

02:30.835 --> 02:32.962
l meant dating.

02:34.463 --> 02:37.007
Yes. Yes. Dating was tough.

02:37.216 --> 02:40.094
- Need any help with that now, Paula?
- No, Tony. Thank you.

02:40.302 --> 02:44.014
l've been there and l've done that.

02:44.223 --> 02:46.892
Your problem with women
is where you're focused.

02:47.101 --> 02:49.311
Where?

02:52.940 --> 02:55.276
Here. lt's a mirror.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.195
Quick question.

02:58.404 --> 03:00.906
The pink ones, do they taste
like Strawberry Starburst?

03:01.115 --> 03:04.952
- l thought you weren't seeing anyone.
- l'm not.

03:05.411 --> 03:09.165
- lt's for my complexion.
- Complexion got a name?

03:09.373 --> 03:11.625
Tony, you so don't wanna go there.

03:11.834 --> 03:14.253
Tell me it's not another agent
because l don't think l--

03:18.299 --> 03:21.552
His name's Bob and he's a lawyer.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.929
What a coincidence.
l hate lawyers.

03:24.138 --> 03:28.350
l know. So do l. That's why
it's purely a sexual relationship.

03:28.559 --> 03:30.436
Well, what would that make me?

03:30.644 --> 03:34.356
A big mistake. lf you do not give me
by birth control pills,

03:34.565 --> 03:36.233
l'm going to break your arm.

03:38.194 --> 03:39.820
Got that coffee.

03:40.029 --> 03:43.282
- Have you been there long?
- Long enough to say: ''No, ma'am.''

03:43.491 --> 03:46.035
- Agent Cassidy.
- Okay. Good answer.

03:47.411 --> 03:49.371
Thank you.

03:51.749 --> 03:53.083
l let her do that.

03:53.292 --> 03:54.668
Thank you.

03:55.628 --> 03:57.129
Who's that?

03:58.422 --> 04:01.509
- Kyle Boone.
- He's an infamous serial killer, probie.

04:01.717 --> 04:03.552
Terrorized the District in the '90s.
Come on.

04:03.761 --> 04:06.472
Twenty-two women went missing
and five bodies were found.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.724
Guy only made one mistake.

04:08.933 --> 04:11.018
He killed a petty officer.

04:11.227 --> 04:12.853
- Gibbs caught him?
- He's scheduled

04:13.020 --> 04:15.397
for a government-sanctioned
dirt-nap on Saturday.

04:15.606 --> 04:18.526
He wants to talk to Gibbs
before they flip the switch.

04:18.733 --> 04:20.236
- Why?
- Claims he's gonna tell him

04:20.402 --> 04:24.532
- where the bodies are.
- What is that doing on my screen?

04:24.740 --> 04:28.410
- l didn't put it there, boss.
- Who did, McGee?

04:28.619 --> 04:31.080
Probie, let me handle this.

04:31.288 --> 04:32.998
Boss.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.793
She did it.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.339
We heard you were interviewing

04:42.591 --> 04:45.511
Kyle Boone and we assumed
we would be providing backup.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.430
You heard wrong, Cassidy.
l'm not interviewing anyone.

04:48.639 --> 04:50.975
Then you might wanna let
the governor of Virginia know.

04:51.142 --> 04:54.228
Since MTAC has him standing by
waiting for your call.

04:58.315 --> 05:00.609
Find her a desk.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.903
- ls that one?
- No, it's taken.

05:05.364 --> 05:08.993
A whole week of TAD with Gibbs.
l can smell the fun already.

05:09.201 --> 05:10.703
Well, it's been a tough month.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.164
Right now he pretty much
hates everyone, Paula.

05:13.956 --> 05:16.041
lncluding himself.

05:16.250 --> 05:19.295
<i>l was told by your director that you
would personally be interviewing</i>

05:19.462 --> 05:21.589
<i>Kyle Boone this afternoon,
Agent Gibbs.</i>

05:21.797 --> 05:24.216
Director Shepard was misinformed,
governor.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.719
Talking to Kyle Boone
would be a waste of time.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.847
<i>Possibly. But if there's even a chance
that he would reveal to you</i>

05:30.014 --> 05:32.099
<i>the location of his victims,
we have to take it.</i>

05:32.266 --> 05:33.559
l disagree, sir.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.771
He's had ten years to think about it.
Why the change of heart now?

05:36.979 --> 05:41.817
<i>ln my experience, men facing
imminent death tend to re-evaluate</i>

05:42.026 --> 05:44.111
<i>the course of their lives.</i>

05:44.570 --> 05:46.113
<i>Most seek forgiveness.</i>

05:46.322 --> 05:48.783
You trust me, sir.
Boone had a lot of interests.

05:50.576 --> 05:53.162
Forgiveness wasn't one of them.

05:53.704 --> 05:56.582
<i>- How can you be so sure?
- l spent five months interrogating him.</i>

05:56.791 --> 05:58.834
<i>A decade ago. People change.</i>

05:59.043 --> 06:02.004
People, sir. Maybe.

06:02.922 --> 06:04.298
Not Kyle Boone.

06:06.050 --> 06:08.677
<i>- Are you refusing to meet with him?
- l'm refusing to entertain</i>

06:08.844 --> 06:13.057
a homicidal maniac who tortured
and killed 22 women, sir.

06:13.265 --> 06:16.060
l have played that game before.

06:16.268 --> 06:20.147
<i>The hundreds of family members who
lost a daughter, a sister or a mother?</i>

06:20.356 --> 06:23.025
<i>- What do l tell them?
- That no matter what Kyle Boone says</i>

06:23.192 --> 06:28.823
in the next few days, come Saturday,
sir, you're gonna make sure he fries.

06:29.698 --> 06:32.952
<i>We all owe you a debt of gratitude
for bringing him to justice, Gibbs.</i>

06:33.160 --> 06:36.580
<i>But you leave me little choice.</i>

06:37.581 --> 06:40.000
<i>l am sorry.</i>

06:44.922 --> 06:48.551
We've got a high-priority transmission
coming through for you in MTAC.

06:48.759 --> 06:52.054
- From who?
- The secretary of the Navy.

07:03.816 --> 07:06.318
- Well, look on the bright side.
- What is the bright side?

07:07.736 --> 07:09.488
You're only here a week.

07:09.780 --> 07:14.535
- Why couldn't l sit at Kate's desk?
- Mostly because it's still Kate's desk.

07:14.743 --> 07:16.829
She was a great agent.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.789
Yeah.

07:19.498 --> 07:22.793
- How are you handling it?
- Same way l handle everything.

07:23.002 --> 07:25.045
l try not to think about it.

07:25.337 --> 07:29.008
- And when that doesn't work?
- There's always junk food.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.968
lt doesn't sound very healthy, Tony.

07:31.177 --> 07:33.888
lt's either that or l start building a boat
in my basement.

07:34.096 --> 07:38.267
- Did you move from your apartment?
- No. Now you see my dilemma.

07:38.476 --> 07:42.354
Hey, if you ever do wanna talk about it,
l'm here for you.

07:42.980 --> 07:44.482
Okay?

07:45.441 --> 07:48.652
- You mean that?
- Yes, of course l mean that.

07:50.988 --> 07:55.159
Okay.
Well, then let me ask you something.

07:56.494 --> 07:58.037
What's Bobby like in bed?

08:00.331 --> 08:05.169
Kate was right.
You are truly, truly pathetic, DiNozzo.

08:06.003 --> 08:07.296
You two might wanna get busy.

08:07.463 --> 08:10.174
Gibbs is headed this way
and he looks pissed.

08:10.382 --> 08:12.134
- Think he caved to the governor?
- No way.

08:12.301 --> 08:14.678
No way. lf Gibbs doesn't wanna do
something he doesn't.

08:14.845 --> 08:16.889
No matter who's asking.

08:21.477 --> 08:23.479
- Where you going, boss?
- Sussex State Prison

08:23.646 --> 08:24.980
to interview Kyle Boone.

08:25.189 --> 08:27.191
Be gone the rest of the day.

08:27.399 --> 08:29.985
Yep, you two sure have him pegged.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.030
We moved Boone to death watch
on Monday.

08:33.239 --> 08:34.948
That's when he decided
he wanted to talk.

08:35.157 --> 08:37.284
We do things a little different here
in Virginia.

08:37.493 --> 08:38.994
The condemned get a choice:

08:39.703 --> 08:41.539
Lethal injection
or death by electrocution.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.791
Boone is the first one
to choose the chair.

08:43.999 --> 08:46.335
- He deserves the worse.
- Special Agent Gibbs?

08:46.544 --> 08:48.295
l'm Adam O'Neill,
Kyle Boone's attorney.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.839
l really appreciate your coming.

08:52.883 --> 08:54.969
l understand your reluctance here.

08:55.553 --> 08:58.597
But l truly believe
that my client's intentions are sincere.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.057
The day l arrested your client,

09:00.224 --> 09:03.269
we found two human female tongues
in his refrigerator.

09:03.477 --> 09:06.689
- l'm familiar with the case.
- Are you familiar with his victims?

09:06.856 --> 09:08.524
Look, l'm not here
to talk about the past.

09:08.732 --> 09:11.235
- l'm here trying to save a man's life.
- Boone wants a deal?

09:11.402 --> 09:14.655
No. Mr. Boone wants the chair
for his crimes.

09:14.864 --> 09:18.033
l'm the one hoping
to get him life in prison.

09:20.077 --> 09:21.454
Good luck with that.

09:22.037 --> 09:23.456
Agent Gibbs, please!

09:24.832 --> 09:26.542
l'm just trying to do my job here.

09:26.750 --> 09:32.047
Maybe together we can both help
the victims' families find some closure.

09:32.548 --> 09:34.008
Be there Saturday.

09:34.216 --> 09:37.261
- You'll be able to see them get that.
- Right this way, gentlemen.

09:37.470 --> 09:39.472
Well, actually, against my advice

09:40.431 --> 09:43.976
Mr. Boone has elected to meet
with Agent Gibbs, alone.

09:44.185 --> 09:46.228
There will be a guard out here
if you need him.

09:47.563 --> 09:49.231
l won't.

09:57.072 --> 09:58.699
Nice to see you again, Jethro.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.912
l wasn't sure if you'd come,
but here you are.

10:05.456 --> 10:07.666
You've got two minutes.
Start talking.

10:08.584 --> 10:10.211
You know,

10:10.419 --> 10:12.379
you look almost the same.

10:13.130 --> 10:16.675
Except the hair.
When did it go grey?

10:16.884 --> 10:18.093
Where are the bodies?

10:18.302 --> 10:20.429
We'll get to that.

10:20.805 --> 10:22.973
There's just a few things l need
to ask you first.

10:23.182 --> 10:26.018
l guess they showed you
my souvenirs?

10:26.227 --> 10:29.939
- There weren't 20 in that jar.
- Your point?

10:30.147 --> 10:32.608
l always thought you were padding
your count.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.070
Baiting me?
Denigrating my rep?

10:36.278 --> 10:39.031
Come on. You know that approach
never worked on me, Jethro.

10:39.240 --> 10:43.035
- A minute thirty-eight.
- Can't we just chat for a bit?

10:43.244 --> 10:44.912
Catch up?

10:46.872 --> 10:49.041
How's the wife?

10:52.086 --> 10:53.796
She left you, didn't she?

10:53.963 --> 10:55.965
l tried to warn you about that.

10:56.173 --> 10:57.842
Women can't understand men
like us.

10:58.050 --> 10:59.218
You've got what, Boone?

10:59.426 --> 11:00.636
Three days left?

11:01.011 --> 11:02.721
How's it feel?

11:04.306 --> 11:09.437
l'm kind of terrified. Weird,
considering my former activities.

11:10.646 --> 11:13.357
They say it can take
up to four minutes to die in the chair.

11:13.566 --> 11:17.903
Me, personally?
l'm hoping it takes a lot longer.

11:19.029 --> 11:20.656
You really have changed.

11:20.906 --> 11:23.200
The old Gibbs would never be
this abrupt.

11:23.659 --> 11:25.161
Did you remarry?

11:27.037 --> 11:29.457
- You've got less than a minute.
- Okay. Okay. Too personal.

11:29.665 --> 11:34.378
And what about NClS Special Agent
Caitlin Todd? Can we talk about her?

11:34.587 --> 11:39.425
<i>l saw her picture in The Post.
They said she was shot by a terrorist?</i>

11:41.469 --> 11:44.638
Did you cut back on the caffeine
like l told you?

11:45.347 --> 11:47.057
See you Saturday.

11:47.266 --> 11:50.436
Come on, Gibbs.
l was just having some fun with you.

11:50.644 --> 11:51.937
You can't leave.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.857
You're here because you're following
orders like a good Marine.

11:55.065 --> 11:56.400
Right, Gunny?

11:56.609 --> 11:59.612
l'll tell you where they are.
Where they all are.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.782
There's more than 22, Jethro.

12:03.199 --> 12:05.075
Lots more.

12:15.795 --> 12:18.047
- Where is he, Timothy?
- Who?

12:18.297 --> 12:20.299
Gibbs, damn it.

12:23.427 --> 12:24.804
Hey.

12:25.930 --> 12:29.517
Do you know the difference between
good and bad cholesterol, Tony?

12:29.683 --> 12:32.311
No, but l'm assuming
it has something to do with taste.

12:32.478 --> 12:35.481
Bad is what came back
on your last blood test.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.441
- Dispose of this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

12:37.608 --> 12:41.529
- That cost me 1 6 bucks, that pizza.
- You'll thank me when you're my age.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.531
But you eat pizza all the time.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.866
- Exactly.
- l don't see the connection here.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.911
Well, of course you wouldn't.
You're not a doctor.

12:50.121 --> 12:52.581
- Where is Gibbs?
- Sussex State Prison.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.125
lnterviewing Kyle Boone.

12:54.375 --> 12:55.709
He said he wasn't going.

12:55.876 --> 12:59.004
- He wasn't.
- Until the SECNAV ordered him to.

12:59.171 --> 13:01.340
- Who's with him?
- No one.

13:01.674 --> 13:04.009
Have you any idea the effect that
psychopath had

13:04.176 --> 13:05.719
on Gibbs ten years ago?

13:05.970 --> 13:09.557
Considering how open Gibbs is about
his personal life, no, not a clue.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.268
He should not have gone alone.

13:12.977 --> 13:14.854
Ducky, it's Gibbs.
l'm sure he'll be fine.

13:15.396 --> 13:19.233
lt's easy for you to say. You didn't have
to live through this the last time.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.695
<i>- DiNozzo.
- Get the truck.</i>

13:22.903 --> 13:25.114
<i>- Where?
- Boone Farm. Bring Cassidy.</i>

13:25.573 --> 13:27.074
Yeah, l got it, boss.

13:27.283 --> 13:30.035
We're on our way. Cassidy, saddle up.
Gibbs wants you in the field.

13:30.202 --> 13:32.496
- Boone family farm.
- Wants me?

13:32.705 --> 13:34.540
That's what he said.
Let's roll.

13:34.707 --> 13:36.750
The difference between ten years ago
and today?

13:38.502 --> 13:41.046
- We have Gibbs back.
- There's another difference, Tony.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.758
Ten years ago, Gibbs
was a very different man.

13:44.967 --> 13:47.386
- You mean he was actually meaner?
- Oh, quite the opposite.

13:48.596 --> 13:50.055
He was--

13:51.098 --> 13:53.726
He was a lot like you.

14:03.736 --> 14:05.070
What do we got?

14:09.575 --> 14:10.910
l can save you the time, Gibbs.

14:11.076 --> 14:13.788
- My measurements are 34--
- Twenty-six, 34.

14:14.580 --> 14:16.749
A hundred and twenty pounds?
l'm right, aren't l?

14:16.916 --> 14:19.919
Did you weigh and measure me
in my sleep?

14:20.085 --> 14:23.172
l'm a crime scene sketch expert.
lt's what l do.

14:23.422 --> 14:25.132
- You'll do.
- Gibbs, again.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.468
You have such a way
of making a gal feel so special.

14:27.676 --> 14:29.053
Put this on.

14:29.220 --> 14:30.262
- McGee?
- Yeah, boss?

14:30.429 --> 14:32.681
You might wanna wear kneepads.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.605
- Do we even have kneepads?
- Equipment inventory is Kate's job.

14:39.772 --> 14:41.273
You might wanna ask--

14:49.281 --> 14:51.117
Do you know
what the hell we're doing?

14:51.325 --> 14:53.953
- Following Gibbs' lead?
- On what?

14:54.161 --> 14:55.538
- l don't know.
- You don't know

14:55.704 --> 14:59.708
- and that doesn't bother you at all?
- You get used to it.

14:59.959 --> 15:01.585
Yeah, that's what l'm afraid of.

15:03.963 --> 15:08.467
This place must have been gone
over a dozen times, boss.

15:08.634 --> 15:11.762
- No way there's any bodies in here.
- l'm not looking for bodies, Tony.

15:12.471 --> 15:15.349
Boone was raised here by his uncle.
His mother was a prostitute.

15:15.516 --> 15:17.143
She left town when he was 1 2.

15:18.477 --> 15:19.812
Then what are we looking for?

15:19.979 --> 15:21.564
Proof. Boone swears it's here.

15:21.730 --> 15:24.984
The only place we didn't look is inside
this chimney.

15:25.651 --> 15:28.112
l think l got something.
No.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.822
That's just another dead bird.

15:32.158 --> 15:33.325
Oh, that's disgusting.

15:33.534 --> 15:37.371
l'll bet this wasn't in the brochure
when you signed up for NClS, probie.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.582
- You know, you were wrong earlier.
- About what?

15:39.748 --> 15:41.542
She weighs more than a buck twenty.

15:43.419 --> 15:45.004
Sorry.

15:45.171 --> 15:47.506
- She did that on purpose.
- Okay. Oh, no. l got--

15:47.673 --> 15:49.633
lt's right here by the flue.
l got it.

15:49.842 --> 15:51.677
- Okay. l got it. l'm coming down.
- Finally.

15:51.886 --> 15:54.889
You could have taken your boots--
Oh, jeez.

15:55.139 --> 15:56.849
My bad.

15:57.683 --> 16:00.019
Looks like a book.

16:21.957 --> 16:24.752
Oh, there must be 30 pages there.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.670
More.

16:27.963 --> 16:30.424
What's carved into their backs?

16:30.674 --> 16:32.760
That's his calling card, McGee.

16:38.474 --> 16:39.725
Something wrong?

16:39.892 --> 16:41.644
This section on my mother,
John, is better.

16:41.811 --> 16:45.898
- But it still needs work.
- l was trying to humanize her, Kyle.

16:46.315 --> 16:47.900
Don't.

16:49.568 --> 16:51.320
You find it all right, Jethro?

16:52.113 --> 16:53.823
l guess you wouldn't be here
if you didn't.

16:53.989 --> 16:56.826
l don't believe you've met
my biographer, John Briggs.

16:57.076 --> 16:59.245
Special Agent Gibbs, it is a pleasure.

16:59.411 --> 17:01.914
l've been trying to schedule
an interview with you for months.

17:02.081 --> 17:03.624
You're gonna have to leave now,
Briggs.

17:03.791 --> 17:07.002
l've been granted special permission
by the State of Virginia to be here.

17:07.252 --> 17:09.088
- Not anymore.
- Next time you see Boone,

17:09.255 --> 17:11.257
he'll have a thunderbolt shooting out
of his ass.

17:11.423 --> 17:15.219
Hey, l was guaranteed full access
for the next three days.

17:15.428 --> 17:17.512
The warden asked you to leave.

17:17.762 --> 17:19.432
Don't make him ask you again.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.517
You'll have to excuse Agent Gibbs,
John.

17:21.767 --> 17:24.854
He's finally gotten a glimpse into
the world l've been telling him about.

17:25.104 --> 17:26.814
The scrapbook?

17:27.021 --> 17:29.483
You found his scrapbook?
When will it be released?

17:29.733 --> 17:31.944
Son, if you wanna walk out of here
under your own power

17:32.111 --> 17:34.447
l suggest you leave now.

17:43.038 --> 17:45.040
John really is a wonderful writer.

17:45.291 --> 17:48.002
You know, he spent years trying
to understand me.

17:48.252 --> 17:50.880
Unfortunately, he just never seemed
to measure up.

17:51.130 --> 17:52.756
To who?

17:52.965 --> 17:54.675
Your prostitute mom?

17:54.884 --> 17:59.305
Or your father? Some hick john
with a few extra bucks in his pocket?

17:59.472 --> 18:02.016
Actually, l was referring to you, Jethro.

18:02.808 --> 18:05.394
Show's over.
Where is the dumping ground?

18:05.644 --> 18:07.480
You show me my scrapbook
one last time

18:07.688 --> 18:10.316
and l'll draw you a map
even a Marine can follow.

18:10.524 --> 18:13.319
No. They've suffered enough.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.196
Well, we're at an impasse.

18:15.404 --> 18:18.032
You gonna keep playing
this game with me, Boone?

18:20.576 --> 18:23.078
l have never considered
any of this a game, Jethro.

18:23.329 --> 18:26.165
- You know that.
- Whatever. l'm changing the rules.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.209
- How so?
- l've seen your world.

18:29.794 --> 18:33.088
Now you're gonna spend what's left
of your miserable life in mine.

18:43.891 --> 18:45.935
All right, listen up,
my probationary field agents.

18:46.185 --> 18:49.146
You are about to witness the transfer
of a maximum-security prisoner

18:49.313 --> 18:50.356
to our humble facility.

18:50.523 --> 18:53.192
While he's here,
he's our sole responsibility.

18:55.069 --> 18:57.571
- Oh, l'm sorry. Am l boring you?
- My God, does he ever stop?

18:57.822 --> 19:00.074
l'm just glad it's not me.

19:00.533 --> 19:04.203
lt's 1 0:00. lt doesn't make sense
bringing Boone here now.

19:04.370 --> 19:06.705
Gibbs is trying to put him
on unfamiliar ground.

19:06.914 --> 19:09.834
- Throw him off balance.
- Because that worked ten years ago?

19:10.584 --> 19:13.045
- What's different now?
- l am, Cassidy.

19:13.212 --> 19:16.382
Stand tall.
Wake up, probies.

19:32.690 --> 19:34.108
l knew l could
count on you, Jethro.

19:38.446 --> 19:40.489
lt's good to be home again.

19:44.410 --> 19:47.246
Yep, good to be home.

19:52.418 --> 19:54.587
The guy's been impersonating
a statue all night.

19:54.753 --> 19:57.089
According to the watch,
he hasn't moved a muscle.

19:57.882 --> 19:58.924
He's creepy.

19:59.133 --> 20:02.261
When is Gibbs gonna start
his interrogation?

20:02.428 --> 20:04.930
- When he's ready.
- You might wanna tell him to hurry.

20:05.097 --> 20:09.143
He's got less than 48 hours before
Boone's scheduled to be executed.

20:09.977 --> 20:12.313
l've got a better idea, Paula.

20:12.521 --> 20:13.898
Why don't you tell him?

20:15.107 --> 20:17.109
Because l'm not stupid.

20:17.276 --> 20:18.611
No.

20:18.903 --> 20:20.988
Of all the things you are,

20:21.280 --> 20:23.324
stupid definitely isn't one of them.

20:25.201 --> 20:26.786
Thank you.

20:26.952 --> 20:29.288
- Okay, what's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

20:30.122 --> 20:34.543
- By the way, how's Bobert?
- Why, are you jealous?

20:35.336 --> 20:37.129
Of a lawyer?
Give me a break.

20:37.296 --> 20:39.673
- He's very rich.
- Money isn't everything.

20:39.924 --> 20:41.926
He's got season tickets
to the Redskins.

20:42.134 --> 20:44.637
- Private skybox.
- l'm happy for him.

20:44.804 --> 20:46.222
And l almost forgot

20:47.056 --> 20:49.809
he drives a Ferrari.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.479
Red.

20:54.063 --> 20:56.148
Like Magnum.

20:57.483 --> 20:58.651
Well, that's nice.

20:59.235 --> 21:00.861
lsn't it?

21:01.070 --> 21:03.489
You know what's even nicer?

21:03.948 --> 21:05.366
My current view.

21:05.574 --> 21:08.160
Victoria's Secret?
Agent Cassidy.

21:08.327 --> 21:11.163
Well, you enjoy it as long as you can,
Agent DiNozzo

21:11.330 --> 21:13.666
because that's as close
as you're gonna get.

21:14.834 --> 21:16.043
Cassidy?

21:18.254 --> 21:20.256
Check Boone's security detail.

21:20.506 --> 21:22.508
You got it.

21:22.675 --> 21:25.177
- l'll give her a hand with that.
- Wait.

21:32.518 --> 21:34.353
- What was that for?
- Letting her get to you.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.230
Boss, l was not letting her get--

21:37.606 --> 21:39.859
l won't let it happen again.

21:41.777 --> 21:44.864
- Thanks.
- lt's for Abby.

21:45.030 --> 21:48.617
Go find out how many victims
she lD'd from Boone's scrapbook.

22:13.684 --> 22:16.270
There were 27 women
in the scrapbook, McGee.

22:16.437 --> 22:19.023
As far as l can tell, they're in the order
that they were killed.

22:19.190 --> 22:21.609
Now, Boone has admitted
to killing 22

22:21.817 --> 22:25.571
which matches with the photos
in the files that the FBl sent over.

22:25.738 --> 22:28.949
Which would make you think
that we'd be left with five Jane Does,

22:29.158 --> 22:34.079
but you'd be wrong because l know
who the first victim is.

22:34.914 --> 22:37.124
You're not listening
to a word l'm saying.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.169
l'm pregnant, McGee.

22:40.669 --> 22:41.921
Twins.

22:42.129 --> 22:44.089
Haven't told the father yet.

22:44.799 --> 22:47.468
lt's Gibbs. l know it's wrong

22:47.676 --> 22:50.554
but something about his silver hair
just gets me all tingly inside.

22:50.721 --> 22:52.598
Excuse me for a sec.
l think l'm gonna vomit.

22:52.932 --> 22:54.600
l'm joking, Tony.

22:54.767 --> 22:56.685
Except for the part about Gibbs' hair.

22:56.894 --> 22:58.687
That is really hot.

22:58.854 --> 23:01.774
- McGee is ignoring me again.
- Easily fixable.

23:02.608 --> 23:05.194
- What? What'd l do?
- Stop ignoring Abby. She's sensitive.

23:05.402 --> 23:06.654
l'm sorry. l was concentrating.

23:06.821 --> 23:08.906
l think that l know how we can find
Boone's victims

23:09.115 --> 23:10.616
without Gibbs having to talk to him.

23:10.866 --> 23:13.786
There are distinctive geographical
and man-made features

23:13.994 --> 23:15.204
in several of these pictures.

23:15.496 --> 23:18.499
Here's a stream
and what may be a bridge.

23:18.707 --> 23:21.752
Up here appears to be a power line.

23:21.961 --> 23:23.921
Or some dirt on a picture.

23:24.130 --> 23:27.341
lf l can make a land plot, create scale
by computing the distances

23:27.508 --> 23:31.345
- between these points, then we can--
- Okay, streams and power lines?

23:31.554 --> 23:34.640
lt would take years searching just one
county, McGee. Never mind a state.

23:34.807 --> 23:37.017
Yeah, for us, Tony.
But not for a computer.

23:37.226 --> 23:39.478
Satellite imagery?
l should have thought of that.

23:39.645 --> 23:42.231
l need to figure a way
to calculate an accurate scale.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.191
Polaroid cameras have
a fixed focal length.

23:44.358 --> 23:46.694
That's a good start. l'm gonna need
one known measurement.

23:46.861 --> 23:50.114
- Pick one body and l'll pull her stats.
- Three known vectors should do it.

23:50.281 --> 23:52.199
Okay. Okay.
Enough with the geek-speak.

23:52.408 --> 23:54.368
Gibbs wants to know how
many victims we lD'd.

23:54.577 --> 23:57.288
All except for the last four
in the scrapbook.

23:57.496 --> 23:59.832
We're running them
against missing persons reports

23:59.999 --> 24:02.710
prior to Gibbs putting Boone
behind bars. No matches yet.

24:02.918 --> 24:06.338
The one that stands out the most
is the first victim.

24:06.547 --> 24:09.091
She disappeared in 1 97 4.

24:09.300 --> 24:11.260
Are you sure about that, Abs?

24:11.469 --> 24:13.220
Boone was just a kid back then.

24:13.429 --> 24:17.099
l know. And it turns out his mother
did not abandon him.

24:17.308 --> 24:20.311
She was his first kill.

24:30.279 --> 24:32.031
You don't have to do this again,
you know.

24:33.491 --> 24:34.909
You're wrong, Duck. l do.

24:36.076 --> 24:38.704
He's never gonna tell you
where those poor girls are.

24:38.871 --> 24:41.874
- l know that.
- Then why?

24:43.417 --> 24:45.961
Because ten years ago
l couldn't break him.

24:46.212 --> 24:48.255
No, but you did
what no one else could.

24:48.464 --> 24:51.467
- You caught the son of a bitch.
- l should have killed him.

24:51.717 --> 24:54.929
And in two days that will be rectified.

24:55.846 --> 24:58.349
l'm telling you as a friend.

24:58.599 --> 25:00.935
lt's time to let this one go.

25:01.143 --> 25:02.394
Not yet, Ducky.

25:02.603 --> 25:05.439
You already lost one relationship
as a result of this case.

25:05.606 --> 25:06.982
She was a wonderful girl.

25:07.233 --> 25:11.070
- And you neglected--
- She left me, Duck. l didn't leave her.

25:11.278 --> 25:15.116
No.
You made it impossible for her to stay.

25:19.745 --> 25:22.665
Okay, send him up.
Make sure he's escorted.

25:22.873 --> 25:24.458
l'll let Gibbs know.

25:26.460 --> 25:27.920
Comfortable?

25:28.295 --> 25:31.257
- Yeah, as a matter of fact--
- lt was a rhetorical question, lady.

25:31.465 --> 25:34.635
Wow, l never realized how sensitive
you were about your desk.

25:34.844 --> 25:36.846
There's a lot about me
you don't realise, Cassidy.

25:37.012 --> 25:39.056
- Where's Gibbs?
- lnterrogation.

25:39.265 --> 25:41.392
Boone's lawyer is here.
He claims he wasn't notified

25:41.600 --> 25:44.270
about his client's being moved
and he wants to talk to him.

25:44.437 --> 25:46.689
Gibbs doesn't like to be kept waiting.

25:46.856 --> 25:48.524
You better go right in there

25:49.066 --> 25:52.111
and tell him yourself. l'll get the suit.

25:56.282 --> 25:58.033
Finally.

25:58.659 --> 26:00.995
So where should we start this time,
Jethro?

26:01.203 --> 26:02.455
My childhood?

26:02.663 --> 26:05.082
l didn't bring you in here to talk, Boone.

26:05.291 --> 26:08.043
So you decided to let me see
my photographs again?

26:08.294 --> 26:10.588
l told you that's not gonna happen.

26:10.796 --> 26:13.716
lnteresting.
May l ask why l'm here then?

26:13.924 --> 26:17.303
The state is hoping
that l'll get the location of your victims.

26:17.511 --> 26:19.847
l believe that requires some form
of communication.

26:20.014 --> 26:23.058
l said the state. Me?

26:23.642 --> 26:24.852
l'm not even gonna try.

26:25.060 --> 26:28.397
But you always try, Jethro.
That's why l like you.

26:28.606 --> 26:31.150
l've taken you out of the system,
Boone.

26:31.358 --> 26:35.362
You're gonna sit here, alone, without
any human contact until you fry.

26:35.571 --> 26:37.072
The game ends now.

26:39.325 --> 26:43.954
This room brings back
so many memories, doesn't it?

26:45.915 --> 26:48.000
Special Agent Gibbs, a word please?

26:48.209 --> 26:50.336
Sounds like you replaced
your dead female.

26:51.045 --> 26:53.130
Any chance l can meet this one?

26:59.345 --> 27:01.764
Well, l'll be here if you need me.

27:05.184 --> 27:07.144
- What?
- Boone's attorney is here.

27:07.353 --> 27:10.439
The DA's afraid if we deny him access,
he'll find a sympathetic judge

27:10.606 --> 27:13.025
- and have the execution delayed.
- l got it.

27:13.859 --> 27:17.154
Look, l need a privileged conversation
with my client.

27:17.363 --> 27:19.949
Meaning, Agent Gibbs,
l want your observation room cleared

27:20.116 --> 27:22.868
and all microphones turned off.

27:23.035 --> 27:26.372
- That's it, counsellor?
- For now, agent.

27:26.872 --> 27:28.040
Tony?

27:28.999 --> 27:33.879
- Yeah, hold on a second.
- Search him first thoroughly.

27:42.304 --> 27:43.722
l'm impressed.

27:44.181 --> 27:46.642
- lt's actually working.
- Thank you.

27:47.184 --> 27:49.770
Now all we have to do is scan
through 800,000 miles

27:49.979 --> 27:52.106
of satellite imagery,
and pray we get lucky.

27:53.566 --> 27:55.151
l am a scientist, McGee.

27:55.401 --> 27:57.945
Luck has nothing to do with it
and/or us.

27:58.988 --> 28:02.241
Okay, then how do you explain
something like Gibbs' gut?

28:02.450 --> 28:05.494
Well, that's easy. Gibbs is lucky.

28:05.703 --> 28:09.457
- But you just said that--
- He's not a scientist.

28:12.293 --> 28:13.544
Agent Gibbs,

28:13.752 --> 28:15.754
if anything happens to my client while
he's here,

28:15.921 --> 28:18.466
l want you to know l am gonna hold
you personally responsible--

28:18.632 --> 28:21.969
You have my word he will be
in perfect health for his execution.

28:23.012 --> 28:26.849
Escort Mr. O'Neill out of my building,
Special Agent Cassidy.

28:27.057 --> 28:28.768
You'll be hearing from me.

28:29.018 --> 28:30.603
Let's go.

28:31.228 --> 28:33.147
You going back in there, boss?

28:33.773 --> 28:35.858
Yeah, maybe. Gibbs.

28:36.233 --> 28:37.276
<i>Gibbs, it's Abby.</i>

28:37.443 --> 28:39.111
<i>We think we found Boone's
dumping ground.</i>

28:39.278 --> 28:42.114
<i>We've got it on a screen in my lab.</i>

28:42.281 --> 28:44.742
They think they may have found
his dumping ground.

28:47.828 --> 28:51.040
- What am l looking at?
- Take it away, McGee.

28:55.127 --> 28:58.464
l mean, very Special Agent McGee.

28:58.672 --> 29:02.968
Probable site where the victims
were tortured, killed, perhaps buried.

29:03.969 --> 29:05.387
- You wanna know how?
- Not really.

29:05.596 --> 29:07.473
Good, because it was mostly luck.

29:07.681 --> 29:10.101
Where? Wilderness area
at Great Falls National Park.

29:10.309 --> 29:12.520
- Tony, you lead the team.
- Where are you going, boss?

29:12.686 --> 29:14.688
After ten years, l finally got something
on Boone

29:14.855 --> 29:16.482
he doesn't already know about.

29:17.358 --> 29:19.276
My lawyer was very upset.

29:19.485 --> 29:22.655
He wanted to move me back to prison.
But don't worry.

29:22.863 --> 29:25.825
- l told him l like it here.
- Don't get too comfortable.

29:26.075 --> 29:27.618
You're going back today.

29:27.827 --> 29:29.829
Really? What's changed?

29:30.663 --> 29:32.998
You found something, didn't you?

29:42.633 --> 29:47.805
The site where the photos were taken
is 265 feet

29:48.013 --> 29:51.267
on a track of 31 0 degrees.
We need to get through here.

29:53.227 --> 29:54.603
Okay.

29:54.895 --> 29:57.648
Remember what l told you
about the poison ivy, all right?

29:57.857 --> 30:00.067
- Don't tell Cassidy.
- What?

30:00.276 --> 30:01.902
Nothing.

30:02.194 --> 30:03.821
Follow me.

30:09.076 --> 30:11.412
l'm okay. l'm okay.

30:12.163 --> 30:15.583
This is steep.
Watch yourselves.

30:24.467 --> 30:26.802
Well, if this is the place
l can see why Boone picked it.

30:27.052 --> 30:30.848
Off the beaten path,
no hard surfaces to reflect sound.

30:31.056 --> 30:33.976
Those girls could scream
their heads off and no one would hear.

30:34.351 --> 30:36.854
Yeah, this is the perfect spot.

31:16.936 --> 31:18.104
Guys,

31:18.395 --> 31:19.730
we're in the right place.

31:25.903 --> 31:28.864
No reception.
Spread out, tape it off.

31:29.115 --> 31:31.492
We'll hike back and call Gibbs.

31:34.203 --> 31:36.831
Come on, Jethro.

31:37.790 --> 31:40.501
We both know you're in there.

31:44.713 --> 31:47.133
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:47.716 --> 31:49.468
- What are you doing here?
- l wanted to see

31:49.635 --> 31:50.970
what the monster looks like.

31:56.976 --> 31:59.061
He doesn't look that scary.

32:00.938 --> 32:02.982
You saw the photographs?

32:03.190 --> 32:05.025
Yeah.

32:12.741 --> 32:16.162
You did good, McGee.
l'm proud of you.

32:16.328 --> 32:17.997
And?

32:18.497 --> 32:19.540
And what?

32:19.707 --> 32:22.334
Well, usually, you add
some kind of insult at the end.

32:22.501 --> 32:23.919
No, l don't.

32:24.170 --> 32:26.714
Well, okay, maybe sometimes.

32:26.922 --> 32:30.676
- But the point is, we're a team.
- Tony?

32:35.681 --> 32:37.391
You all right?

32:37.683 --> 32:40.019
l was a little startled.

32:40.227 --> 32:41.479
By what?

32:41.687 --> 32:43.731
Her.

32:54.116 --> 32:57.328
She couldn't have been dead
more than a few days.

32:58.746 --> 33:01.540
Tony, you're not gonna believe it.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.376
Boone's mark.

33:15.430 --> 33:18.725
l-- l can't get any reception out here.

33:19.726 --> 33:21.436
That's not surprising.

33:21.644 --> 33:23.813
Butt-nowhere isn't part
of our coverage plan.

33:24.022 --> 33:26.899
l'm gonna head back to the truck
and try and get the call through.

33:27.108 --> 33:29.986
Okay, tell Gibbs we're gonna need
everything and everyone on this one.

33:30.236 --> 33:31.487
l'll be back in 20 minutes.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.462
Yeah, Gibbs.

33:47.712 --> 33:48.963
Gibbs.

33:49.213 --> 33:51.132
<i>- We found Boone's dumping ground.
- Good work.</i>

33:51.466 --> 33:54.260
<i>- Tell Tony he needs to call--
- We also found a fresh body.</i>

33:54.427 --> 33:56.262
Female.
Dead less than a week.

33:56.429 --> 33:58.598
She has Boone's mark on her back.

33:58.806 --> 34:01.809
l think we're definitely dealing
with a copycat killer.

34:02.936 --> 34:06.606
- Gibbs? Gibbs, can you hear me?
- Yeah, l heard you.

34:06.773 --> 34:08.942
l want the area sealed off.
l'm on my way.

34:17.283 --> 34:18.784
Tony.

34:19.786 --> 34:22.163
- Something's not right.
- No, nothing has been

34:22.330 --> 34:24.581
since Boone showed up at NClS.

34:24.748 --> 34:26.960
No. No, l know this girl.

34:28.002 --> 34:30.129
You know her?
How?

34:30.295 --> 34:33.049
You know her too. She was
the last entry in Boone's scrapbook.

34:33.257 --> 34:34.634
One of the Jane Does.

34:35.802 --> 34:38.679
He's been on death row for ten years,
McGee.

34:38.888 --> 34:42.850
She's been here less than a week.
That's not possible.

34:50.149 --> 34:51.525
lt can't be.

34:58.950 --> 35:01.244
You look a little peaked, Jethro.

35:01.452 --> 35:03.413
ls something wrong?

35:03.746 --> 35:05.373
Maybe l can help.

35:05.581 --> 35:08.918
A new development, perhaps?

35:09.335 --> 35:10.628
l gotta hand it to you, Boone.

35:11.546 --> 35:13.172
l did my best.

35:13.381 --> 35:15.925
But you got me to play your game.
Congratulations.

35:16.968 --> 35:19.470
You found the bodies. Good.

35:19.679 --> 35:22.432
Not what you were expecting,
was it?

35:22.640 --> 35:24.559
You see, there's someone else
out there, now.

35:24.767 --> 35:26.185
A new threat.

35:26.394 --> 35:29.147
And l'm the only one
who can help you find him.

35:30.148 --> 35:32.233
You'll have to request a stay
of my execution.

35:33.651 --> 35:36.195
l'm gonna have to pass on that.

35:37.405 --> 35:41.075
No matter how this plays out,
you're gonna sit in that chair Saturday.

35:41.284 --> 35:43.953
You can't have changed this much.
You have a sworn duty.

35:44.370 --> 35:45.997
Maybe. Ten years ago.

35:46.205 --> 35:48.333
Now, hell.

35:48.541 --> 35:50.668
l can wait till Sunday
to start an investigation.

35:50.877 --> 35:53.963
- You're bluffing.
- You're dead in 36 hours.

35:54.172 --> 35:57.050
Yeah, well, l'll be here
when you change your mind.

36:13.608 --> 36:15.526
Cassidy.

36:17.654 --> 36:18.947
Cassidy.

36:19.989 --> 36:21.491
Great. She's lost.

36:21.699 --> 36:24.744
Why didn't you give her
your GPS thingy, probie?

36:25.662 --> 36:26.996
She's not lost.

36:28.289 --> 36:29.874
What's going on?

36:31.918 --> 36:33.169
She's been kidnapped.

36:34.504 --> 36:36.089
McGee, where is my list
of every visitor

36:36.256 --> 36:38.424
and phone call Boone's
had since he's been in prison?

36:38.591 --> 36:40.677
- l'm working it, boss.
- Tony?

36:42.553 --> 36:45.098
- Tony. Backup team's in place?
- Yeah.

36:45.932 --> 36:47.934
l never should have let her
take off alone, boss.

36:48.726 --> 36:52.730
The Polaroid of Cassidy is clean.
No prints, no DNA. l'm sorry, Gibbs.

36:52.897 --> 36:54.774
- l screwed this thing up.
- You screwed it up?

36:54.941 --> 36:57.026
We should have known
there was more than one killer.

36:57.193 --> 36:59.696
l only ran the Jane Does
up until the time Boone was captured.

36:59.904 --> 37:01.948
All four have gone missing
the last three years.

37:02.156 --> 37:04.492
Concentrate on Boone's contacts
over the past three years.

37:04.659 --> 37:05.910
Yeah.

37:06.953 --> 37:08.121
We can't lose another agent.

37:08.538 --> 37:09.956
- l can't take this.
- Okay.

37:10.123 --> 37:12.166
Our best bet is a guy named
John Frederick Briggs.

37:12.333 --> 37:15.253
ln the last three years,
he's logged 229 phone calls

37:15.461 --> 37:16.963
and visited Boone
96 times.

37:17.130 --> 37:18.423
He's writing Boone's biography.

37:18.631 --> 37:20.717
- He's living it.
- He's off to a good start.

37:20.883 --> 37:22.927
Dishonourable discharge
from the Army in '91 .

37:23.136 --> 37:25.346
Arrested for domestic disturbance
in 2000

37:25.513 --> 37:27.223
- for beating his girlfriend.
- Find him.

37:27.432 --> 37:28.975
Home address
and cell phone number.

37:29.142 --> 37:32.061
- Find out if his cell has a GPS locator.
- Checked the carrier.

37:32.270 --> 37:34.939
lt does and it can be remotely activated
if it's reported stolen.

37:35.106 --> 37:36.774
- Good job, McGee.
- Good job, McGee.

37:36.941 --> 37:38.151
Let's roll.

37:49.078 --> 37:52.457
Okay, Briggs' cell provider
is relaying us his location.

37:52.665 --> 37:55.585
- He's in movement.
- He's headed out of D.C. on 1 90 west.

38:02.050 --> 38:03.718
He's getting off the 1 90 at Oakley.

38:03.927 --> 38:06.471
lf you get off at MacArthur,
you might make it before him.

38:11.267 --> 38:13.811
<i>- How far ahead is he?
- Less than a mile.</i>

38:20.151 --> 38:21.861
That's gotta be him.

38:32.580 --> 38:34.290
Keep your hands on the wheel.
Keep them up.

38:34.958 --> 38:36.542
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

38:36.751 --> 38:38.086
Where is she, Briggs?

38:38.920 --> 38:41.839
Okay.
Okay, l have every right to be here.

38:42.590 --> 38:44.509
Heard from a guard
you found the bodies.

38:46.386 --> 38:48.429
- l wanna see them.
- Shut up.

38:56.646 --> 38:58.815
Hello.

39:09.909 --> 39:11.494
What did you do to me?

39:13.621 --> 39:16.749
l hit you in the head with a shovel,
my dear.

39:17.083 --> 39:19.836
- Did you kill that woman we found?
- l did.

39:21.838 --> 39:24.132
How many more are there, O'Neill?

39:24.340 --> 39:25.717
Let's see, there was...

39:25.883 --> 39:28.720
There was one, and then
there's two, three, four.

39:29.345 --> 39:31.014
You will make five.

39:33.933 --> 39:37.395
How did Boone turn his lawyer
into his replacement?

39:37.562 --> 39:41.649
You really think l'm Boone's lawyer
by coincidence? Come on.

39:41.858 --> 39:44.819
See, l--
l sought Boone out.

39:47.155 --> 39:48.448
Why?

39:48.656 --> 39:50.491
So l could learn from him.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.744
Learn from the best.

39:52.952 --> 39:56.748
And you,
you're my graduation present.

40:03.755 --> 40:07.717
You know, you can scream
if you want to. lt's allowed.

40:13.556 --> 40:15.725
Kyle says he wants Agent Gibbs
to remember him

40:15.892 --> 40:19.020
for a long, long time
after he's gone.

40:19.228 --> 40:20.813
So you and me

40:22.440 --> 40:25.485
we're gonna take this nice and slow.

40:34.744 --> 40:35.912
Fighter, huh?

40:36.579 --> 40:38.665
l haven't had one of those before.

40:38.831 --> 40:40.625
Try that thing again with that knife--

40:40.792 --> 40:43.419
You wanted to see your scrapbook?

40:44.128 --> 40:46.464
Where is my agent?

40:55.098 --> 40:56.849
Stop.

40:57.308 --> 40:58.476
Stop--

41:00.270 --> 41:02.021
Look, you don't know what--

41:02.272 --> 41:03.731
You don't know what you're doing.

41:05.566 --> 41:08.278
- Jethro. Don't.
- Damn it.

41:09.320 --> 41:12.282
l don't know where she is.
How can l?

41:14.033 --> 41:17.954
Gibbs, please. Just let me see
them one last time. Please.

41:18.162 --> 41:19.706
l'm begging you.

41:20.456 --> 41:23.668
Where is she?

41:28.840 --> 41:32.427
We all know
you can't destroy evidence.

41:32.635 --> 41:34.554
Pathetic, Jethro.

41:35.930 --> 41:38.308
Do you really think that l need that
to see them?

41:38.891 --> 41:41.811
When they're all up here,
anytime l want?

41:42.895 --> 41:44.439
Your agent is gonna suffer.

41:44.647 --> 41:47.483
The obscenities unleashed on her,
legendary. You know why?

41:47.650 --> 41:51.195
Because you're the one
that stopped me. This is all your fault.

41:54.949 --> 41:58.995
He's cutting her tongue
out of her mouth right now.

41:59.621 --> 42:01.164
And you know the best part?

42:01.331 --> 42:03.207
After l'm gone

42:03.416 --> 42:06.336
bodies are just gonna continue
to pile up.

42:07.670 --> 42:09.672
Shoot me.

42:12.008 --> 42:14.552
You're supposed to shoot me,
you idiot!

42:14.761 --> 42:18.806
That the big plan you spent
ten years working on?

42:20.308 --> 42:25.021
Get me to murder you
and ruin my own life?

42:27.690 --> 42:29.776
He's carving your name
in her back right now.

42:29.984 --> 42:33.029
Game's over.
Back to death row.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.365
Gibbs.

42:38.159 --> 42:41.162
The governor call yet? Because they're
not gonna kill me now.

42:41.371 --> 42:43.623
l'm the only one
who can identify the killer.

42:44.916 --> 42:48.419
Do you think she screamed
when he cut out her tongue, Jethro?

42:48.586 --> 42:49.671
l don't know.

42:49.879 --> 42:52.340
Why don't you ask her yourself?

42:54.634 --> 42:57.262
l'm afraid your lawyer is gonna miss
your execution tomorrow.

42:57.428 --> 42:59.597
He's kind of dead.

43:00.390 --> 43:02.100
Enjoy hell.

43:03.726 --> 43:07.855
No. No! No!
