WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:03.761
Previously on SEAL Team...
See the doctor.
See what he says,

00:03.800 --> 00:06.189
and then we'll talk
about deployment.
Doc says I don't get

00:06.240 --> 00:07.195
deployable status,
that's it, we're done.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.332
We're not gonna be out
on the street because

00:08.370 --> 00:10.201
you missed one deployment.
You can't pay the mortgage,

00:10.240 --> 00:11.366
you generally end
out on the street.

00:11.410 --> 00:13.776
So you're telling me
you don't need any surgery?
Nope.

00:13.810 --> 00:16.142
Doc fixed me up with some
heavy-duty anti-inflammatories.

00:16.180 --> 00:17.477
Told me not to bench
with a straight bar.

00:17.510 --> 00:19.478
Huh?
Stop being worried.
I'm good.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.045
I had fun last night.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.341
Maybe we can do it again
later in the week.

00:23.390 --> 00:24.516
CLAY:
The only thing worse than not

00:24.550 --> 00:26.188
seeing you for the
next three months

00:26.220 --> 00:27.448
would be never seeing you again.

00:27.490 --> 00:30.220
What are you doing?
Will you marry me?

00:30.260 --> 00:33.127
I want to come _home.
Do you really think we
ought to be talking about

00:33.160 --> 00:34.650
big life decisions?

00:34.700 --> 00:36.463
Come on, what do you want me
to do-- open up some

00:36.500 --> 00:38.320
tactical training business?

00:38.370 --> 00:40.361
ALANA: Nobody kicks down
doors forever.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.838
STEVE:
TOC, this is Echo Team.

00:45.870 --> 00:47.679
Approaching target.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.733
TOC, this is Echo 1.
Breach in place.

01:18.770 --> 01:20.237
Preparing to assault.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.249
TOC: Copy, Echo 1.
You are clear for entry.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.448
Get in there.

01:31.850 --> 01:34.410
Go, go, go.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.651
Last man!

02:02.520 --> 02:04.215
JASON:
You know what? Okay.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.787
It's mostly
just a little sand there

02:06.820 --> 02:10.688
in the pressure restrictor,
but you should be good to go.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.391
Well, at least
Emma won't have an excuse

02:12.430 --> 02:14.250
to use my shower anymore.
Speaking of Emma,

02:14.300 --> 02:16.518
she's at Cathy's tonight, right?
Sleepover?

02:16.570 --> 02:18.390
And, uh, Mikey--
he's at practice,

02:18.430 --> 02:20.898
so maybe we should
check out the pressure here...

02:20.940 --> 02:22.464
...see how it works for us,
right?

02:22.510 --> 02:24.637
How come you always
turn into such a horndog

02:24.670 --> 02:26.228
before deployment?

02:26.280 --> 02:28.168
You know, it's
on my checklist...

02:28.210 --> 02:29.541
Really?
...for my SEAL
deployment, yeah.

02:29.580 --> 02:33.448
Mm. You know
where you're going?

02:33.480 --> 02:35.243
We're picking up
from, uh, Steve

02:35.280 --> 02:38.249
and, uh, Echo Team,

02:38.290 --> 02:40.485
you know, from
J-Bad, probably.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.612
We'll find out
more next week,

02:41.660 --> 02:43.651
what's going on.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.858
You know, I made a reservation

02:47.900 --> 02:50.198
for me and the kids
out at Splash Country.

02:50.230 --> 02:52.733
Well, did Emma--
she kick and scream?

02:52.770 --> 02:55.295
Nah, we've been going there
before your deployments

02:55.340 --> 02:57.501
since she was six.
Yeah.

02:57.540 --> 03:00.236
Think she likes
the tradition.

03:04.950 --> 03:08.647
She asked me if, uh,
you were coming this year.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.511
Oh.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.779
Right, well, you know,
I just assumed that,

03:16.830 --> 03:19.219
because of the year
that we had...

03:19.260 --> 03:21.399
No, I know.
So did I. It's just,

03:21.430 --> 03:22.920
I don't know-- the way
things have been going,

03:22.970 --> 03:25.859
I thought maybe we
could give it a shot?

03:25.900 --> 03:27.561
Okay, yeah,
let's do it.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.239
Jason, if this doesn't
feel right, we don't...

03:30.270 --> 03:32.830
we don't have to force it.
Alana, It's good.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.905
Let's do this, okay?

03:34.940 --> 03:36.601
Okay.
All right?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.299
All right. Then I'll
tell the kids tonight.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.671
They'll be
really excited.
Perfect.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.688
Hey, I got to pick up Mikey.
He's out at Hampton Roads.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.312
You want to come?

03:44.350 --> 03:46.489
Ah, I told Sonny
I'd work out with him.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.011
On a Saturday night?
Well, it's on his checklist
before deployment.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.925
Right.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.258
Then I guess
I'll talk to you later.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.291
Yeah.

04:04.540 --> 04:05.768
SONNY: I got-I got...
one more, one more.

04:05.810 --> 04:06.970
One more?
All right.

04:07.010 --> 04:08.500
Let's go.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.668
Yeah? Monster, man. Monster.

04:13.380 --> 04:14.779
285 for seven.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.310
That's a PR, right there.
Yeah?

04:16.350 --> 04:18.648
Put it on the board.

04:18.690 --> 04:22.524
I always lose so much damn
muscle when we end up deploying.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.585
Something in the air
gets in my food,

04:24.630 --> 04:26.325
makes me not
have an appetite.

04:26.360 --> 04:27.725
That's called adrenaline.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.057
It's called dirt.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.295
Goat dung.
And despair.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.969
Goat dung, eh? Didn't know
you were such a philosopher.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.561
The Quinns come from a long line
of warrior poets.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.977
You know, we used to advise

04:41.010 --> 04:43.604
the ancient kings in Tara.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.709
Yeah, look it up.
Right?

04:45.750 --> 04:47.615
Make sure you look,
uh, after Spenser

04:47.650 --> 04:49.686
when we're
over there.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.450
Got it?

04:52.490 --> 04:54.708
I ain't babysitting pretty boy
over there.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.625
You forgetting something?

04:56.660 --> 04:57.979
You remember how Ray
took care of you

04:58.030 --> 04:59.520
on your first cycle?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.551
The only thing Ray looked after

05:01.600 --> 05:04.865
was making sure that my ass
went through the door first.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.732
Look after him.

05:09.870 --> 05:11.861
Yeah.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.721
Eric, what the hell?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.648
Little busy
for the weekend, huh?
Yeah, well,

05:31.690 --> 05:33.419
we got a little
something going on.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.927
Yeah, I can see that.
What is it?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.860
One of our teams in Afghanistan,
they ran into something.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.390
Casualties?

05:41.100 --> 05:44.069
of understanding the situation,
but as intel comes in,

05:44.110 --> 05:46.772
I'll keep you informed.
That's the best I can promise.

05:46.810 --> 05:49.404
Yeah, okay.
Look, uh,

05:49.450 --> 05:51.839
if you got any plans
tonight, put 'em on hold.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.416
That bad?

05:53.450 --> 05:54.815
MAN:
Uh, Lieutenant?
Be right there, Nathan.

05:54.850 --> 05:56.386
Just stick around,
all right?

06:11.170 --> 06:13.138
Naima? Babe, I'm home.

06:13.170 --> 06:15.058
I got those lights for the porch
we talked about.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.738
About, you know,
the-the black ones

06:16.770 --> 06:19.477
with the, uh,
soft finish?

06:19.510 --> 06:22.172
LEDs are built in, which
I don't love, but...

06:22.210 --> 06:25.179
they'll last forever,
so we're good, right?

06:25.210 --> 06:27.815
Great.

06:27.850 --> 06:31.149
Yeah, that's what I thought.
What... what'd I say?

06:31.190 --> 06:33.078
Nothing. They sound good.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.850
Okay, you want
to talk about something.

06:35.890 --> 06:37.152
No.

06:37.190 --> 06:40.455
I just got an interesting
phone call today.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.525
From your doctor.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.663
What, um...

06:44.700 --> 06:46.839
what doctor?

06:46.870 --> 06:49.191
Uh, the one you
canceled on last week.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.208
The one you
told me you saw.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.970
Who gave you the big
thumbs-up for deployment.

06:54.010 --> 06:55.534
That doctor.

06:56.910 --> 06:58.002
Doesn't ring a bell.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.018
Raymond Perry...

07:00.050 --> 07:01.449
Okay, all right.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.981
I didn't go see him.

07:03.020 --> 07:03.918
Yeah, obviously.

07:03.950 --> 07:05.178
I didn't need to, babe.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.448
It's better.

07:06.490 --> 07:07.957
I swear. Otherwise...

07:07.990 --> 07:09.548
You wouldn't have lied to me?

07:09.590 --> 07:12.184
Look, I just didn't
want you to worry, okay?

07:12.230 --> 07:14.448
It is better.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.627
Naima, I was just
in Iraq, all right?

07:16.670 --> 07:17.819
Doing my job.

07:17.870 --> 07:20.862
And-and-- not a problem.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.539
So why are you
hiding tramadol

07:23.570 --> 07:26.130
in your sock drawer?

07:26.170 --> 07:28.479
Hey, I'm your wife.

07:28.510 --> 07:30.842
I occasionally
launder your socks.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.916
It's for flare-ups.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.747
All right?
All the guys carry it.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.213
You shouldn't lie to me.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.512
No matter what it is.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.108
I can take it.

07:39.150 --> 07:41.209
That's my job.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.625
Okay.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.753
Fair enough.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.496
Does Jason know?

07:48.230 --> 07:50.221
Jason knows all he has to.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.728
Take it.

07:53.770 --> 07:55.738
Hey.

07:55.770 --> 07:57.203
Yeah, man,
hold on.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.733
It's Spenser.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.101
I told him I'd meet him up at
the dealership up on Lynnhaven.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.744
Fine.

08:05.780 --> 08:09.147
But I have 12 days to talk you
out of this insanity.

08:09.180 --> 08:13.253
And I'm gonna
be doing a lot talking.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.952
Yeah, man. I'm on my way.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.525
CLAY:
That's not a problem.
RAY: No, that is.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.197
Ithought
you liked your car.

08:25.230 --> 08:26.197
Yeah, I do
like my car.

08:26.230 --> 08:28.698
Okay.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.537
No, I just, uh, you know,
maybe it'd be nice

08:30.570 --> 08:33.175
to have something
to come home to.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.235
We are still talking
about the car, right?

08:35.280 --> 08:37.305
I mean, that's what
you wanted my help with--

08:37.350 --> 08:40.774
figuring out which one
you want to get?

08:40.820 --> 08:42.708
Yeah, you know, you, uh,

08:42.750 --> 08:44.240
order it on deployment,

08:44.290 --> 08:46.281
don't pay any tax.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.651
You think I'm crazy, don't you?
Ask her to marry me,

08:51.690 --> 08:53.157
and I've only known her
a couple months.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.326
Not if you want to marry her.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.896
I did when I asked her.

08:55.930 --> 08:57.261
Yeah, you did.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.063
Lying in that hospital bed,
high on china white,

08:59.100 --> 09:01.193
fresh off seeing your life
flash in front of you

09:01.240 --> 09:02.798
down that hole in Al

09:02.840 --> 09:05.161
You're damn right
you wanted to, then.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.075
Question is, do you want to
in the cold light of morning?

09:07.110 --> 09:09.601
You think I don't.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.175
I think the fact we're having
this conversation is, uh,

09:12.210 --> 09:14.747
not a very good sign.

09:14.780 --> 09:17.010
Dude, I just, you know,
I really like this girl a lot.

09:17.050 --> 09:19.189
Oh, yeah, that's what
every girl wants to hear.

09:19.220 --> 09:20.687
"I like you a lot."

09:20.720 --> 09:23.280
You're-you're
gonna stand there

09:23.330 --> 09:26.356
and tell me that, with Naima,
you just, you knew.

09:26.390 --> 09:28.119
One day-- boom,
that's it, you knew.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.821
13 years ago, Clay.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.327
13 years, four months and...

09:32.370 --> 09:34.258
eight days.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.734
Oh, my gosh.
You're kidding me.
She was the night nurse on duty

09:36.770 --> 09:38.829
and I was the guy bleeding
all over her new white shoes.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.007
Crawled right across 'em.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.031
I didn't know Naima served.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.344
She didn't.
She was subbing at the ER

09:44.380 --> 09:46.348
at Henry Ford Hospital
in Detroit.

09:46.380 --> 09:49.349
I was still at Team 3 doing a
urban assault training rotation

09:49.380 --> 09:51.143
when me and a couple guys
mixed it up with some locals

09:51.190 --> 09:53.078
outside_ a club
on Wyoming Street.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.749
Ended up with me
about three pints low,

09:56.790 --> 09:58.382
going into shock.

09:58.430 --> 10:02.218
Looked up, saw Naima.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.727
She saved me that night.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.192
Every night since.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.131
Man, I had no idea.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.934
Look, let's just say
the Ray you're looking at--

10:10.970 --> 10:13.632
that wasn't always me.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.103
Back then, I was angry.

10:16.140 --> 10:18.074
And stupid.

10:18.110 --> 10:20.840
Not a good combination.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.745
All changed that night.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.746
It's not a choice,
for me.

10:26.990 --> 10:28.958
That's an awfully high bar.

10:28.990 --> 10:31.424
You asked.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.758
Hey, what's up, Jace?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.928
Hey, yo, look, there's something
going on downrange.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.323
Um, I think it's Echo.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.395
How bad?
It's bad.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.135
Helo crash?
JASON: It could be.

10:42.170 --> 10:43.137
I need you to get down here.

10:43.170 --> 10:44.239
All right, I can be there

10:44.270 --> 10:45.737
in 20 minutes.
I got Spenser with me.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.772
Well, bring Spenser.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.453
Hello?

11:03.490 --> 11:05.822
JASON: Hey, look, it's me.
I'm-I'm calling

11:05.860 --> 11:07.953
because, uh...

11:08.000 --> 11:10.264
Look, there's
a, uh, a situation, um,

11:10.300 --> 11:12.063
in J-Bad with one of our teams.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.397
Did they lose anyone?

11:13.440 --> 11:14.896
Well, it's unclear.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.339
God.

11:16.370 --> 11:18.065
Hey, listen,
is Emma still at Cathy's?

11:18.110 --> 11:19.998
Yeah, I told you,
she's spending the night.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.707
Oh, my God. Not Steve.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.274
I don't know.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.449
It's really unclear.
They're reporting him

11:26.480 --> 11:28.744
as missing right now.
I just, um...

11:28.780 --> 11:31.010
I just need you
to get down there

11:31.050 --> 11:32.449
and get her out of there

11:32.490 --> 11:34.458
before there's
any kind of notification.

11:34.490 --> 11:36.355
Just get her out of there.
Yeah, okay, okay, mm-hmm.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.381
Call you later.
All right.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.488
They really use these things

12:05.520 --> 12:07.112
_ to calculate
their breaching charges?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.184
Yeah, they're called
construction calculators

12:08.220 --> 12:09.448
for a reason.

12:09.490 --> 12:11.788
I'm glad to see they...

12:11.830 --> 12:14.424
still using hammers, at least.
Oh, yeah, they're good

12:14.460 --> 12:16.428
for putting a new deck
onto your hooch.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.496
Or cracking
a Tali sentry's skull.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.031
But I guess they use tomahawks
for that now.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.435
No, no, not since
that Times article.

12:21.470 --> 12:24.837
Apparently tomahawks are
cruel. Haven't you heard?

12:24.870 --> 12:26.838
Oh, and hammers aren't?

12:26.880 --> 12:30.771
Honestly, I can't
keep track.

12:30.810 --> 12:32.778
With all these restrictions,
this almost

12:32.820 --> 12:34.845
makes me glad
I'm not deploying.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.485
Yeah, almost.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.488
I know you miss it.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.511
I'll miss you.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.850
It's funny-- I was
always the one leaving.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.527
It sucks staying behind.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.425
Yeah, now you know
how all those ladies felt.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.496
What ladies?
Mm-hmm.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.895
How long you staying, anyway?

12:55.940 --> 12:57.237
Uh, while you're gone?
Yeah.

12:57.270 --> 12:58.532
Couple weeks, at least.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.299
Mm, couple weeks, huh?

13:00.340 --> 13:02.570
If that.

13:02.610 --> 13:04.908
It's not like there's anything
keeping me here.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.542
Nice. Really nice.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.775
Oh.

13:10.450 --> 13:12.543
Yeah, Jason?

13:15.120 --> 13:17.782
Hey, help me get the
stuff back in the car.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.421
Appreciate you all
coming in so quickly.

13:23.470 --> 13:27.292
I know you're all wondering.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.309
So here it is.

13:30.340 --> 13:34.208
Last night, at approximately
0100 hours local time,

13:34.240 --> 13:37.471
DEVGRU Team Echo was on their
second mission of the night.

13:37.510 --> 13:39.375
It was a follow-on
operation

13:39.410 --> 13:40.843
in the Khush Gumbad
neighborhood

13:40.880 --> 13:42.142
of Jalalabad.

13:45.150 --> 13:48.381
BLACKBURN:
The target was a
private residence.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.581
They breached
the structure,

13:50.630 --> 13:54.452
made entry. Seconds
later, there was...

13:54.500 --> 13:56.593
an explosion.

13:56.630 --> 13:59.019
JASON:
What are we talking--
bodyguards with S-vests

13:59.070 --> 14:00.560
or the whole place
just rigged?

14:00.600 --> 14:02.568
Yeah.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.101
Probably all that.

14:04.140 --> 14:05.630
Survivors?

14:05.670 --> 14:08.036
None that we know of.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.570
SONNY: So you're
telling me that all...

14:09.610 --> 14:12.875
six guys are dead.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.139
The casualty notification teams
are en route.

14:16.180 --> 14:18.182
Damn it.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.522
Echo Team was
handing off to us.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.425
I just talked to Steve Porter
yesterday.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.451
Right.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.233
Uh... the squadron

14:33.270 --> 14:35.568
is now down a full team.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.534
Which, as you know,

14:37.570 --> 14:39.902
is an_ untenable
Situation.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.476
To remedy it,

14:41.510 --> 14:44.547
Command has asked that your
date of deployment be moved up.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.002
To when?

14:46.050 --> 14:49.110
You leave in 18 hours.

14:49.150 --> 14:51.618
Any tidying up you need do
on the personal front,

14:51.650 --> 14:54.653
now's the time
to do it.

14:54.690 --> 14:56.885
Any questions?

15:27.620 --> 15:29.281
How's Cindy?

15:29.320 --> 15:30.628
You can imagine.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.685
They find out anything,
or you can't say?

15:32.730 --> 15:34.493
Not much.
It was a follow-on.

15:34.530 --> 15:37.522
One guy leads one team from one
one location to another and...

15:37.570 --> 15:39.094
house just dropped on 'em.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.166
Suicide bomber?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.963
That's what it
sounds like.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.001
Jason...

15:55.280 --> 15:59.148
CINDY: We were supposed
to go to Coronado, you know?

15:59.190 --> 16:01.283
Kids have never been, and...

16:01.320 --> 16:03.254
it's where he did BUD/S,
so...

16:03.290 --> 16:07.021
...he'd always
wanted them to see it.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.724
He said, "You don't know
what a real ocean feels like

16:10.770 --> 16:14.433
until you've nearly
drowned in the Pacific."

16:14.470 --> 16:16.233
He was a tough bastard.

16:16.270 --> 16:17.259
CINDY:
Yeah.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.031
Not tough enough.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.506
None of us are.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.183
I am such a clich.

16:30.220 --> 16:33.053
But, God, you don't know,

16:33.090 --> 16:35.251
do you...

16:35.290 --> 16:38.225
until it happens to you?

16:39.330 --> 16:40.729
Naima and I were gonna

16:40.760 --> 16:44.161
take Cathy and Robert to the
Dairy Queen on Atlantic.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.168
Maybe go to the
aquarium after?

16:46.200 --> 16:49.169
Yeah. That's good.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.407
Being here
is just...

16:51.440 --> 16:54.500
it's too sad.

16:54.540 --> 16:57.043
It's okay. We'll
get 'em stoned

16:57.080 --> 17:00.709
on Oreo Blizzards and
pop by to see the otters.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.479
Thank you.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.488
Otters are good.
Yeah.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.317
Thank you.

17:08.220 --> 17:11.656
I miss him so much.

17:11.690 --> 17:14.488
We're family.
We're gonna get through this.

17:14.530 --> 17:15.827
All right?

17:17.230 --> 17:19.528
It's okay,
it's okay.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.104
Hey, how's little man doing?

17:27.140 --> 17:29.404
Watching Adventure Time
with Sonny.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.443
Sonny really knows a lot
about Adventure Time.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.210
Yeah.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.138
We gonna talk sometime?

17:37.190 --> 17:39.818
I mean, I guess it's moot now.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.819
What, about deployment?

17:42.860 --> 17:44.828
What am I supposed
to do, Naima?

17:44.860 --> 17:48.125
Nothing.
You're going. I know.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.321
My mom's gonna be here,
and I'm gonna go back to work,

17:50.370 --> 17:54.192
and everything's gonna be fine.
Till it's not.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.367
Hey, stop that.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.163
Ray, I'm just...

17:58.210 --> 17:59.802
I'm worried.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.603
Babe, I'm gonna be fine.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.369
Believe me.

18:03.410 --> 18:05.241
But I got to take care
of this stuff.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.747
Those men?

18:06.780 --> 18:08.270
They were my brothers.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.187
Just promise me
if your shoulder acts up,

18:11.220 --> 18:13.450
you'll take yourself out.
I told you, honey,

18:13.490 --> 18:15.378
I will get it checked out.

18:15.420 --> 18:18.184
No, Ray,
you'll take yourself out.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.119
These kids-- they don't
have a father anymore.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.388
You understand?

18:22.430 --> 18:24.421
Cindy doesn't
have a husband.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.791
Promise me.

18:26.830 --> 18:29.230
Okay.

18:29.270 --> 18:30.806
I promise.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.899
I promise.

18:32.940 --> 18:35.306
Liar.

18:35.340 --> 18:38.446
: Oh, come on.
Stop that. Stop, stop, stop.

18:42.850 --> 18:45.284
I'll get this one.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.311
I'll go relieve Sonny.

18:52.630 --> 18:54.427
DANNY: Hey, you.
Hey.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.429
Danny.
Ray.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.892
Thought you had your hands full
with load in.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.535
Or you should
have your hands full. What...

19:01.570 --> 19:02.867
wheels up in six hours.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.164
And 27 minutes.
We're gonna be fine.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.371
How's Cindy?

19:07.410 --> 19:09.275
She's okay.

19:09.310 --> 19:10.277
Let's get you some coffee.

19:10.310 --> 19:11.504
Oh, you know what?

19:11.550 --> 19:13.177
You came up just in time.
We ran out.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.676
Give me a break, Perry.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.245
I'll make some coffee.
Where's the kitchen?

19:22.760 --> 19:24.728
I like him.
Me too.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.496
This sucks, Ray.

19:30.530 --> 19:33.693
Yeah. I know.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.506
Supposed to be my job.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.701
Oh.
Well, there's really

19:43.750 --> 19:46.401
not much left to do here
but just drink it.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.611
Oh, well, for that,
I brought my own.

19:48.650 --> 19:50.709
Nice.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.638
Danny, by the way.
Sorry. Um, Stella.

19:52.690 --> 19:55.784
Nice to meet you.
Are you, um...

19:55.820 --> 19:58.220
are you Bravo Team

19:58.260 --> 19:59.887
or Charlie, Delta,
whatever?

19:59.930 --> 20:01.397
I'm sorry, I don't...

20:01.430 --> 20:03.466
No, no, not one of
those teams, but yeah.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.491
A while ago.

20:08.670 --> 20:12.436
Oh. No, thank you.
Thank you.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.472
It's really hard.

20:16.410 --> 20:19.277
Yeah, hardest part
of war, pretty much.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.514
How do you mean?

20:23.520 --> 20:25.010
What comes after.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.909
CLAY:
There you are.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.915
Cool, man.
Good to see you.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.325
How you doing?
Hey.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.725
How you doing?

20:32.760 --> 20:34.352
You all right?
Yeah.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.490
I'm gonna
go bring the coffee.

20:37.530 --> 20:39.498
Oh, thank you,
thank you.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.031
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

20:41.070 --> 20:44.301
Really interesting guy.

20:44.340 --> 20:46.399
Just gonna put this in the...

20:46.440 --> 20:49.477
Uh, so, I-I owe you an apology.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.302
You do?

20:52.350 --> 20:53.476
Yeah.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.317
Okay.

20:55.350 --> 20:56.840
Look, the other night
in the hospital,

20:56.880 --> 20:58.484
what I asked you-- I...

20:58.520 --> 21:01.057
I shouldn't have_
put you In that posntlon.

21:01.090 --> 21:04.958
Well, in your defense, you
were on a lot of morphine.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.458
I'm serious.
All right, look,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.024
I-I know that we're not
ready to get married, okay?

21:09.060 --> 21:11.028
I'm not gonna make you say it.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.026
Okay.

21:13.070 --> 21:14.867
Um...

21:14.900 --> 21:18.063
Thank you, actually.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.839
Really, I-I... Ijust...

21:19.870 --> 21:23.374
I wasn't_ sure how
to say It myself.

21:23.410 --> 21:25.002
Okay.
Yeah.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.938
So we can just...
we can go back to how we were

21:26.980 --> 21:28.447
before the hospital
the other night?

21:28.480 --> 21:30.948
Yes, just having fun
getting to know each other.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.389
All right.
All right.

21:32.420 --> 21:33.956
But we're not picking out
baby room colors.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.787
N... Heavens, no.

21:35.820 --> 21:38.721
Listen, um...

21:38.760 --> 21:41.399
I'm actually gonna...
I think I should leave,

21:41.430 --> 21:44.399
'cause I feel a little weird
being here when I'm not family.

21:44.430 --> 21:46.091
All right, well,
let me drive you.
No, no, no. You stay.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.461
Stay.
No, I want to.

21:47.500 --> 21:50.333
Okay.
All right.

21:50.370 --> 21:51.359
I just got to say good-bye
to some people.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.763
Oh, all right.
I'll be right there.

21:52.810 --> 21:53.799
I just have to make
a quick call, okay?

21:53.840 --> 21:55.671
Okay.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.540
What's going on?

22:05.590 --> 22:08.411
This is going on forever...
but it's good.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.486
Aquarium's got some
special otter thing at 1:30.

22:11.530 --> 22:14.351
Cindy said the kids
have been dying to see it.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.722
You have to reserve seats
or aprons or something.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.522
That's great.

22:19.570 --> 22:20.867
We'll leave in an hour?

22:20.900 --> 22:22.697
Sunday, though. Beach traffic.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.401
Maybe sooner?
Um,

22:24.440 --> 22:27.568
wheels up at
1730,so".

22:27.610 --> 22:29.669
Still time to say good-bye
to the kids.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.445
You know,
I guess, um,

22:35.480 --> 22:38.415
Splash Country is out.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.781
So, what do you want
to tell the kids?

22:44.830 --> 22:46.752
You mean about us?

22:46.790 --> 22:48.894
What do you want
to tell 'em?

22:48.930 --> 22:51.660
We never really decided
on anything, did we?

22:51.700 --> 22:53.463
Well, now's not
really the time.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.036
No, it's never
really the time.

22:55.070 --> 22:57.903
You want to get
into this now?

23:00.680 --> 23:03.069
I'm sorry.

23:03.110 --> 23:06.409
It's okay.
You got work to do.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.948
I thought we'd have a few days,

23:10.990 --> 23:15.017
a week away from work
when it could be...

23:15.060 --> 23:16.948
when it could be
just us, the family,

23:16.990 --> 23:20.528
but... I don't think
it's ever gonna be that again.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.154
I didn't think that we'd
get hit like this, Alana.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.521
Yeah, but if it wasn't this,
this horror,

23:25.570 --> 23:27.959
it would be something else.

23:29.740 --> 23:32.106
It doesn't want
to let you alone, Jace.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.677
It neve lets you alone.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.609
Never does.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.504
Yeah.

23:40.550 --> 23:42.916
I see that.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.086
Come on, I know you.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.084
I'm the love of your life.

23:55.860 --> 23:58.590
But I don't think
I should be your wife anymore.

23:58.630 --> 24:00.860
I know you've been trying,

24:00.900 --> 24:02.959
really trying
to talk with me more

24:03.000 --> 24:04.763
and share with me
what you can.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.766
I know how hard
it is for you,

24:06.810 --> 24:09.802
how the closer you get
to rejoining this family,

24:09.840 --> 24:11.478
the more you feel like

24:11.510 --> 24:14.741
_ there's a noose
tightening around your neck.

24:14.780 --> 24:17.749
Not 'cause you don't want
to be part of the family.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.487
It's just 'cause your other
family's got too tight a hold.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.519
I'm sorry.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.524
I can't. I can't
share you anymore.

24:36.770 --> 24:38.101
Yeah.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.505
WOMAN :
Hello, ma'am.

24:39.540 --> 24:40.507
Are you there

24:40.540 --> 24:41.973
Take it. Take it.
Jason...

24:42.010 --> 24:43.807
Take it.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.671
Uh, yes, I'd like
to reserve four tickets

24:46.710 --> 24:48.610
for the Otter Experience.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.811
Two adult and
two children.

24:54.620 --> 24:57.009
The name is Alana Hayes.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.924
What's going
on, slugger?

25:06.970 --> 25:08.961
Just getting my head right.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.499
Getting your
head right, yeah.

25:15.110 --> 25:17.271
What?

25:17.310 --> 25:18.971
Watching this crap?

25:19.010 --> 25:21.012
Yeah.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.083
Keep my mind empty,

25:25.120 --> 25:28.658
so I can fill it with
all the hate I can muster up...

25:28.690 --> 25:31.682
get 'em sons of bitches
that killed our brothers.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.589
This the part where you, uh,

25:41.640 --> 25:44.837
supposed to tell me
to keep my head on straight,

25:44.870 --> 25:48.636
keep my ass in line, or one of
the many Jason pearls of wisdoms

25:48.680 --> 25:51.069
that you drop at these times?

25:51.110 --> 25:53.749
Not gonna say a word.

25:53.780 --> 25:56.772
And thank God
there aren't, uh,

25:56.820 --> 26:00.142
many times like these
in the near future.

26:00.190 --> 26:02.715
*

26:02.760 --> 26:05.251
Amen.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.721
I need to get after 'em, Jace.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.625
We will.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.036
Hey.

26:14.070 --> 26:15.935
We'll get 'em.

26:27.980 --> 26:29.345
NEWS ANCHOR :
Thank you, Richard.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.745
Right now, this is all we know.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.212
The Defense Department
is confirming

26:32.250 --> 26:34.218
that several members
of the Naw's elite

26:34.260 --> 26:36.080
Special Warfare
Development Group,

26:36.120 --> 26:37.849
commonly knows as SEAL Team 6,

26:37.890 --> 26:39.755
have been killed
in an encounter

26:39.790 --> 26:42.327
with the Taliban forces
in Jalalabad, Afghanistan.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.692
DOD is confirming
the names of the dead

26:44.730 --> 26:46.721
as Chief Petty Officer
Robert Johnson,

26:46.770 --> 26:49.739
Senior Chief Petty Officer
Steven Porter,

26:49.770 --> 26:52.898
Petty Officer Richard Williams,
No!

26:52.940 --> 26:56.000
...Petty Officer Chris Hall,
Petty Officer Michael Miller,

26:56.040 --> 26:58.099
and Petty Officer Ramon Garcia.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.947
We'll have further details

26:59.980 --> 27:01.811
for you as we learn them.

27:01.850 --> 27:03.841
(phones continue
ringing and buzzing)

27:21.740 --> 27:23.731
*

27:30.710 --> 27:32.701
*

28:03.310 --> 28:05.676
*

28:32.510 --> 28:34.831
*

29:01.570 --> 29:03.367
*

29:54.590 --> 29:57.457
Gentlemen.
What's up, Deke?

29:57.490 --> 29:58.923
Hey.
What's going on?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.325
Good to see you.
Thank you.
Yeah.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.429
Deke.

30:01.460 --> 30:02.893
Assuming you guys got
the broad strokes on the plane?

30:02.930 --> 30:04.261
Yeah.
RAY:
Oh, yeah.

30:04.300 --> 30:05.562
Well, unfortunately,
at this point,

30:05.600 --> 30:07.363
that's all we got,
is the broad strokes.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.231
Anything you can tell
us outside the brief?

30:09.270 --> 30:11.306
Yeah.

30:11.340 --> 30:14.002
Echo was out
on a routine hit. No name

30:14.040 --> 30:16.508
on the target. Basically,
just a digital silhouette.

30:16.540 --> 30:18.906
Burner cell phone being used
to call phones

30:18.950 --> 30:21.316
that belong to the group
we've been going after.

30:21.350 --> 30:24.239
So, anyway, when we first
got here a couple months ago,

30:24.290 --> 30:27.282
we were rolling up some
couriers, low-level bomb-makers.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.914
Even getting a few to flip.
The problem was,

30:29.960 --> 30:33.555
the brass had gotten so uptight
about kicking the wrong doors.

30:33.590 --> 30:36.093
Every time we'd get a tip
for a follow-on target,

30:36.130 --> 30:38.166
we'd have to sit on it and wait

30:38.200 --> 30:40.259
until we could finally get
somebody to green-light.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.369
Well, that just gives time

30:41.400 --> 30:42.936
for the bad guys
to change things up.

30:42.970 --> 30:45.359
Yeah.
DEKE:
So, a few weeks ago,

30:45.410 --> 30:47.401
brass decides to
take the leash off,

30:47.440 --> 30:49.533
let us start hitting the
follow-on targets immediately

30:49.580 --> 30:51.468
before the bad guys
could change it up.

30:51.510 --> 30:53.171
So, all of a sudden,
we're doing some damage, man.

30:53.210 --> 30:54.472
Yeah.
We grabbed some

30:54.520 --> 30:56.442
mid-level commanders,
killed another one

30:56.480 --> 30:58.539
when his bodyguard clacked off
his S-vest too early.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.218
Anyway, that night,

31:01.260 --> 31:04.058
Echo tracks the target phone
to a house outside of J-Bad.

31:04.090 --> 31:05.921
All right, like I said,
it's routine.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.518
They take the door.

31:07.560 --> 31:11.929
There's one fighting-age male
on target inside-- Tariq Jamala.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.530
Now, turns out Jamala
is a small-time local

31:14.570 --> 31:16.390
real estate developer.
He's got a bunch

31:16.440 --> 31:18.067
of rental properties
all over the city.

31:18.110 --> 31:21.079
Field interrogation before
they throw him on a helo,

31:21.110 --> 31:23.408
he says that one of his other
properties just happens

31:23.440 --> 31:26.978
to be where Hamid Gul Baladur
is spending the night.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.978
A quick refresher?

31:29.020 --> 31:31.113
Here's an organizational chart
of the Halani Network.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.482
Boom, boom, boom.
JASON:
There he is.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.919
Baladur's number two.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.417
So, Echo loads Tariq
onto the helo.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.655
Fly over to the house where
he claims Baladur is staying,

31:39.690 --> 31:41.954
and they tell him that
he's going inside with them.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.490
They take the door,

31:43.530 --> 31:47.398
and boom-- the whole place
comes down on our boys.

31:47.430 --> 31:49.990
Brass's working theory?
Baladur's

31:50.040 --> 31:51.598
bodyguard clacked off
his S-vest.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.370
Pretty big blast for an
S-vest if you ask me.

31:54.410 --> 31:57.072
Could have been multiple S-vests
set off simultaneously.

31:57.110 --> 31:58.998
So, the brass just
wants to assume

31:59.050 --> 32:01.518
that the intel is good,
and Baladur's dead,

32:01.550 --> 32:03.609
and he's underneath that
rubble with our guys.

32:03.650 --> 32:05.515
How long till we
know for sure?

32:05.550 --> 32:07.211
So, the FBI forensics team
got delayed

32:07.250 --> 32:08.558
a little bit getting in there.

32:08.590 --> 32:10.717
We're actually just going
through it right now.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.991
We did not deploy two weeks
early to wait on the FBI.

32:14.030 --> 32:15.327
You guys want
to occupy yourselves?

32:15.360 --> 32:16.520
Oh, yeah.
You should take a hop

32:16.560 --> 32:18.061
on over to Shinwar.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.318
Have a sit-down
with Qasim Zadran.

32:20.370 --> 32:22.099
Yeah, that rings a bell.
RAY:
Oh, yeah.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.562
Yeah. So, Zadran is just about

32:23.600 --> 32:26.103
the biggest warlord
this side of Kandahar.

32:26.140 --> 32:29.337
Ain't nothing much moves around
these parts except by his leave.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.541
So, if anybody would know
what went down in that house

32:31.580 --> 32:34.048
that night, it'd be Zadran.
JASON:
What do you say, Ray?

32:34.080 --> 32:37.174
Huh? Want to go sit down
with a warlord?

32:54.300 --> 32:58.168
Thank you for your hospitality,
Sheik Qasim.

33:03.580 --> 33:06.208
You know why we're here?

33:22.660 --> 33:25.197
He says we're here
about our dead men.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.139
Look, ask him if he knew
who they were targeting.

33:30.570 --> 33:32.504
Hamid Gul Baladur.

33:32.540 --> 33:34.508
Hmm.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.532
What makes you say that?

33:37.580 --> 33:39.309
I am the master here.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.648
I know everything.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.545
Including your English.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.480
Had Americans here
for over 30 years.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.057
You think
I wouldn't learn your language?

33:48.090 --> 33:50.615
First, we slaughtered
the Russians together,

33:50.660 --> 33:53.049
then Taliban and al-Qaeda.

33:53.090 --> 33:57.720
Now, God willing, we will
slaughter Hamid Baladur.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.625
Unless he's dead already.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.562
Buried under that house along
with your dead soldiers?

34:06.610 --> 34:08.305
We hope so.

34:08.340 --> 34:11.571
Well, then, I'm sorry to be
the one to break bad news.

34:11.610 --> 34:15.114
Baladur's alive?

34:15.150 --> 34:17.573
You're certain?

34:21.120 --> 34:23.657
ERIC:
He could have been

34:23.690 --> 34:25.226
jerking your chain.
JASON:
Well, that's possible,

34:25.260 --> 34:26.625
but what does
he have to gain?

34:26.660 --> 34:28.799
I agree. I don't see
what he gains by telling us

34:28.830 --> 34:31.424
that Baladur didn't die in the
house unless he knows it's true.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.722
ERIC: I don't suppose
he told you

34:33.770 --> 34:35.738
how he knew that
Baladur's alive?

34:35.770 --> 34:39.604
IfI had to guess,
I'd say someone's seen the guy

34:39.640 --> 34:42.279
moving around the tribals
sometime since the house blew.

34:42.310 --> 34:43.675
ERIC:
Makes sense.

34:43.710 --> 34:45.644
Yeah, but it doesn't
get us very far.

34:45.680 --> 34:47.443
Where do we stand
on foren5ics?

34:47.480 --> 34:51.314
Only DNA we've found so far are
our guys' and the informant.

34:51.350 --> 34:52.715
Okay, well, how long till
they're done searching?

34:52.750 --> 34:53.614
DAVIS: Sounds like
it's gonna be

34:53.650 --> 34:54.878
another couple hours at least.
JASON: Okay.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.809
In that time, why don't we say
we kick down some doors, right?

34:57.860 --> 35:00.556
ERIC:
Halani Network's behind
a whole lot of doors.

35:00.590 --> 35:02.729
JOC is worried
that this incident

35:02.760 --> 35:05.126
could turn public sentiment
against our efforts here.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.730
So, the more targets we hit, the
less it looks like we're about

35:07.770 --> 35:09.192
to pack up and go home.
JASON:
If they did

35:09.240 --> 35:10.696
set a trap for Echo, that's why.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.264
'Cause they know
we're coming in strong.

35:12.310 --> 35:15.336
Well, if our guys did
get led into a trap,

35:15.380 --> 35:17.371
Tariq's the one
who led them there,

35:17.410 --> 35:18.877
so seems to me that he's
a good place to start.

35:18.910 --> 35:20.673
RAY:
Except, as we speak,

35:20.710 --> 35:23.679
some FBI guy is picking Tariq's
teeth out of the ceiling tile.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.439
Mm-hmm.
_Contacts on
Tariq's phone, um--

35:26.490 --> 35:28.355
how many of them
are new to us?

35:28.390 --> 35:30.711
They were all connected
to Halani except one.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.728
The last phone call he made,

35:32.760 --> 35:34.796
just at the same time
Echo was hitting the door.

35:34.830 --> 35:37.754
Yeah. Maybe he was trying
to tell somebody good-bye.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.564
What's the geolocation?
DAVIS: The phone is in an
apartment building in Kabul,

35:40.600 --> 35:42.431
and hasn't moved
since we started tracking it.

35:42.470 --> 35:44.734
Get this thing
greenlit for us?

35:44.770 --> 35:46.328
I can try.

35:46.370 --> 35:47.507
Let's go kick doors down.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.685
Bravo 5 to Bravo 4,
door is clear.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.768
Guy left in a hurry.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.791
Think he maybe was tipped off?

36:52.810 --> 36:54.937
Been here a while.
A couple days, maybe.

36:54.980 --> 36:58.848
Which means he took off _
because he knew we were coming.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.371
Here's the phone.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.918
The apartment belongs
to Azim Raisani, 19.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.928
Works for Tariq's
contracting business.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.564
So, he left the phone.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.522
'Cause he knows it's burned.

37:20.570 --> 37:21.594
He knows that
about this place, too.

37:21.640 --> 37:22.959
SONNY:
How you figure that?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.604
Well, he's got to figure
the phone gets us here.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.302
Kid's 19 years old,
no bad-guy record.

37:27.340 --> 37:30.275
Maybe he don't know
we're onto him.
RAY:
Ah, except

37:30.310 --> 37:32.449
he stripped the SIM card
from the phone.
JASON: I'm with Spenser.

37:32.480 --> 37:34.448
Guy's not coming back.
Oh, God.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.744
So where does that
leave us, boss?
I'll talk to his family.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.816
Guy doesn't look like
he has any family.

37:38.850 --> 37:41.011
Tariq's family.
CLAY:
Interrogator's

37:41.050 --> 37:43.518
been sweating 'em since
the second that house went up.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.857
You got answers
for everything, don't you?

37:44.890 --> 37:46.653
Hey. What have we got to
lose? Prepare for exfil.

37:46.690 --> 37:48.351
Good? Let's move.
Yeah.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.857
Copy that.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.595
Tell me what's
g0ing on there.

37:52.630 --> 37:53.995
Why are you so
hard on the kid?

37:54.030 --> 37:56.396
Well, you asked me
to baby-sit him.
Look at me.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.431
I told you, we're gonna
get these guys, all right?

37:58.470 --> 38:01.735
Roger that.
Don't take it out
on Spenser. Let's go.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.032
Let's go.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.743
So, the wife barely speaks.

38:10.780 --> 38:12.919
The mother says her son
would never be involved

38:12.950 --> 38:14.588
with terrorists.

38:14.620 --> 38:17.054
Says he was a Wali.
Saint.

38:17.090 --> 38:19.888
Saint walked our boys
into an ambush.
MANDY: Can she explain why

38:19.930 --> 38:22.592
her Wa son had a phone linked
to the Halani Network?

38:22.630 --> 38:23.995
Why he told our guys

38:24.030 --> 38:26.726
he knew where
to find Hamid Baladur?

38:26.770 --> 38:29.034
See, she doesn't
believe he did.

38:29.070 --> 38:31.095
She says we must
be making it up.

38:31.140 --> 38:34.371
Man, Tariq was her oldest
and only son.

38:34.410 --> 38:37.379
Around here,
that is the next thing to a god.

38:37.410 --> 38:38.775
What about Azim?

38:38.810 --> 38:40.038
Says the same thing.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.116
"My son would never
associate with such people."

38:42.150 --> 38:43.879
Azim worked for her son,

38:43.920 --> 38:45.808
so I'm pretty sure
that makes them associated.

38:45.850 --> 38:47.613
Plus, nothing we found
at Azim's place says

38:47.650 --> 38:49.015
that he was a militant.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.709
I mean, what do you want me
to tell you?

38:50.760 --> 38:53.979
Apparently, denial ain't just
a river in Egypt, right?

38:54.030 --> 38:56.794
What about the widow?

38:56.830 --> 38:59.390
DEKE: Ah, like I said,
she barely speaks.

38:59.430 --> 39:00.966
Mostly defers to
the mother-in-law.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.729
You tried talking
to her alone?

39:02.770 --> 39:04.408
DEKE:
Wow.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.135
Why didn't we think of that?

39:06.170 --> 39:07.933
You try using a woman
to talk to her?

39:07.970 --> 39:09.972
I don't have
one to use.

39:10.010 --> 39:12.547
Can't see it making much
difference, anyway, but...

39:12.580 --> 39:15.378
Mind if I take a crack?

39:15.420 --> 39:17.411
DEKE: Mi casa,
su casa.

39:19.650 --> 39:22.756
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.

39:26.090 --> 39:28.888
MANDY: May God bless you
and your children.

39:38.570 --> 39:42.438
My mother-in-law
is awful, as well.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.740
Hmm?

39:53.790 --> 39:56.884
How did Tariq feel about her?

40:08.500 --> 40:10.161
Essentially, "he couldn't
stand that bitch."

40:14.540 --> 40:17.839
MANDY: Tariq's mother said
he wasn't a militant.

40:27.490 --> 40:29.117
She says he wasn't.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.980
Yeah, the thing is, the
mother-in-law couldn't offer

40:31.020 --> 40:34.626
an alternate explanation
for Tariq's behavior.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.063
We've been recreating
Tariq's pattern of life,

40:47.110 --> 40:51.501
and he's got huge gaps in his
online presence in most days.

41:04.260 --> 41:06.080
She says
he was living green.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.620
Oh, she's trying
to hustle us.

41:07.660 --> 41:09.651
CLAY: It's hard to
argue against that.

41:09.700 --> 41:12.021
Tariq's life screams
"tradecraft."

41:12.070 --> 41:14.459
Or a guy with
something to hide.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.004
Can she offer _
an alternate explanation

41:25.050 --> 41:26.870
for her husband's pattern?

41:26.910 --> 41:28.912
His secret life?

41:32.750 --> 41:35.583
I thought man-love was
accepted in this culture.

41:35.620 --> 41:39.056
The widow said that the husband
fell in love with this kid Azim.

41:39.090 --> 41:41.752
And how's that add up to her
knowing where Azim's hiding out?

41:41.800 --> 41:43.722
She said that Tariq had a house
he never rented,

41:43.760 --> 41:45.625
said she was supposed
to take the kids there

41:45.670 --> 41:46.989
if it was ever bug-out time.

41:47.030 --> 41:48.588
Speaking of which,
Deke said

41:48.640 --> 41:50.232
the neighborhood's
pretty hostile, boss.

41:50.270 --> 41:53.205
Take the Scooby vans.
Hey, you.

41:53.240 --> 41:56.129
Lets us fly under the radar.
J_ASON:
We go in, we go out.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.000
We hit the house hard,
get the kid,

41:58.040 --> 42:00.144
and we're gone
before anyone knows we're there.

42:00.180 --> 42:01.249
Yeah.
Man.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.214
RAY:
Yeah, I do.

42:03.250 --> 42:04.842
I'm calling it "hooch,"
because that's what it is.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.710
I looked up
the definition of "hooch,"

42:06.750 --> 42:09.651
and it just happens to be
"a lightly thatched hut."

42:09.690 --> 42:12.181
Oh.
Thank you,
Mr. Webster.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.619
Oh, yeah? 'Cause
you know what I got?

42:14.660 --> 42:17.026
"Hootch, a highly inferior
whiskey." See "rot got."

42:17.060 --> 42:19.164
See "that toilet moonshine
Sonny makes under his bed."

42:19.200 --> 42:21.191
Only thing highly inferior
is your palate.
