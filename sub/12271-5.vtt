00:12.453 --> 00:15.224
You're not going anywhere
until you tell me the truth.

00:15.292 --> 00:17.159
How can I tell you the truth

00:17.227 --> 00:19.160
when I don't even know
what you're talking about?

00:19.228 --> 00:20.566
You're not gonna talk?

00:20.633 --> 00:22.237
Okay.

00:22.305 --> 00:24.339
Then I guess I'll just have
to make you talk.

00:24.407 --> 00:26.311
That's not...

00:26.378 --> 00:28.414
That's not a can filled
with pennies, is it?

00:28.481 --> 00:31.317
Please, please, Ryan.

00:33.661 --> 00:35.331
I told you
I don't know anything!

00:35.399 --> 00:36.873
Ryan, stop!

00:36.940 --> 00:38.808
Please!

00:43.122 --> 00:45.426
Why are you doing this to me?!

00:45.494 --> 00:48.198
Because I know what
you really are now.

00:48.266 --> 00:50.137
You're trying to ruin my life.

00:50.205 --> 00:52.310
How is that even possible?

00:52.378 --> 00:54.518
I'm just a dog.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.291
Any complex human emotion
you see in me

00:57.359 --> 00:59.161
is just wishful
anthropomorphization.

00:59.229 --> 01:02.005
I'm your friend, Ryan,

01:02.073 --> 01:04.545
but haven't we been
down this road before?

01:04.613 --> 01:05.682
Ah.

01:05.749 --> 01:07.688
This time...

01:07.756 --> 01:09.160
I have proof.

01:09.227 --> 01:11.265
Remember last night?

01:11.332 --> 01:14.606
I was complaining about my work.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.810
Goldsmith's been
such a bitch lately.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.448
I'm so sick of her
always riding my ass

01:20.516 --> 01:22.889
about deadlines and
bringing in new clients.

01:24.828 --> 01:26.362
Give me the pen,
give me the pen.

01:26.430 --> 01:28.266
Give me the pen.

01:28.334 --> 01:30.172
Oh!

01:36.081 --> 01:37.685
I should send this to Goldsmith.

01:39.122 --> 01:40.290
Yeah, right.

01:40.358 --> 01:41.859
What? You don't think I'd do it?

01:48.677 --> 01:51.278
Come on, no way, dude!

02:06.844 --> 02:08.312
Man, I'm beat.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.848
Yeah, I'm pretty wrecked.

02:13.523 --> 02:15.392
Oh, look at Bear over here.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.629
"I'm a year sober.

02:17.698 --> 02:19.534
"I can have just one.

02:19.602 --> 02:21.340
I'll be fine."

02:21.408 --> 02:22.810
Gross.

02:22.878 --> 02:24.780
It's in your hair.

02:56.631 --> 02:58.732
Are you just getting up?

02:58.800 --> 03:00.667
No, no.

03:00.734 --> 03:02.502
Well, I was in the neighborhood

03:02.570 --> 03:03.972
and figured you'd need
a friendly reminder

03:04.040 --> 03:05.680
about Joffrey's
preschool interview today.

03:05.708 --> 03:07.941
I remember. Yeah, I'm taking
a sick day to be there.

03:08.009 --> 03:10.277
Okay, don't screw this up, Ryan.
You went to Delmore Academy.

03:10.344 --> 03:12.580
It'll mean a lot to the
admissions officer to see you

03:12.648 --> 03:13.950
in that interview with us.

03:14.018 --> 03:15.650
I'd love for him to go
to Delmore.

03:15.716 --> 03:17.449
Joffrey getting into Delmore
is the first step

03:17.517 --> 03:18.797
to him getting
into Johns Hopkins

03:18.818 --> 03:20.552
and not losing the love
of his mother.

03:20.620 --> 03:22.089
Are you sure
they'll remember me?

03:22.157 --> 03:23.759
That's a great point.

03:23.826 --> 03:26.194
Just bring your yearbook,
and I have to go do

03:26.262 --> 03:27.629
Joffrey's hair appointment.
Just don't be late.

03:27.696 --> 03:29.097
2:00 p.m. sharp.

03:29.164 --> 03:30.245
I'll be there. Don't worry.

03:32.937 --> 03:35.439
What a night, huh?

03:35.507 --> 03:37.074
I could really use

03:37.141 --> 03:39.378
a little skin of the human
that kicked me.

03:41.116 --> 03:43.049
Give you a sip?

03:43.116 --> 03:44.650
There is nothing you can do

03:44.718 --> 03:47.121
to make me enable your disease.

03:47.188 --> 03:49.058
Put that back in your pants!

03:49.126 --> 03:50.993
Stop flaunting it.
We get it.

03:51.061 --> 03:52.060
You're well-endowed.

03:52.128 --> 03:53.496
I have to run some errands.

03:53.563 --> 03:55.599
I should be back in a few hours.

03:55.667 --> 03:57.733
Sweet bag. I didn't know
they made that in gray.

03:57.801 --> 03:59.534
Oh, man.

03:59.602 --> 04:01.069
Remember that drawing?

04:01.136 --> 04:02.271
Thank God I didn't mail it.

04:02.338 --> 04:03.778
Goldsmith would've
fired me for sure.

04:07.144 --> 04:08.510
Hey.

04:08.577 --> 04:09.577
Take it easy, mate.

05:07.519 --> 05:11.484
I'll admit, I was surprised

05:11.552 --> 05:13.052
when you didn't mail
the drawing.

05:13.120 --> 05:16.926
How dare you think
I'd mail your drawing.

05:16.994 --> 05:19.832
If I weren't tied up right now,
I'd slap your face.

05:19.899 --> 05:21.965
I only took it
with me 'cause I knew

05:22.033 --> 05:24.200
they were gonna pick up
the trash this afternoon.

05:24.268 --> 05:27.506
I was trying to not mail it.

05:27.573 --> 05:30.777
I should've known
you wouldn't mail it.

05:30.844 --> 05:33.046
That would've been
too... obvious.

05:33.114 --> 05:34.883
No.

05:34.951 --> 05:36.686
No, you had another plan
in mind.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.122
Not only is Joffrey

05:38.189 --> 05:39.790
the nephew of a former student,

05:39.858 --> 05:41.759
but he's also Latino.

05:41.827 --> 05:43.594
Sorry, is there
a bathroom nearby?

05:43.661 --> 05:45.394
Yes, right down the hall
to your left.

05:46.864 --> 05:48.398
Hurry back.

05:53.172 --> 05:54.438
Wilfred?
Ryan!

05:54.506 --> 05:55.938
What the hell
are you doing here?

05:56.005 --> 05:57.706
Go home.

05:57.773 --> 05:58.906
What are you doing with my bag?
Ryan, wait.

05:58.974 --> 06:00.641
Give me my bag!
What are you...

06:08.582 --> 06:10.116
Oh, my...

06:10.183 --> 06:12.984
They kicked us out on the spot.

06:13.052 --> 06:14.686
Joffrey lost any chance
he'd have

06:14.753 --> 06:16.153
of getting into that school.

06:16.221 --> 06:17.787
Kristen won't speak to me.

06:17.855 --> 06:20.255
She thinks I'm some kind
of sexual deviant.

06:20.322 --> 06:22.623
And I know exactly
how you did it.

06:22.691 --> 06:24.491
You got the gerbil
from the pet store;

06:24.559 --> 06:26.092
and the lube, the liquor
and the ski mask

06:26.160 --> 06:27.462
from the convenience store.

06:27.530 --> 06:29.466
This was all premeditated,

06:29.533 --> 06:31.733
because you're not
actually Wilfred.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.037
You're the evil god, Krungel.

06:34.105 --> 06:36.541
Krungel?

06:36.609 --> 06:38.776
Dr. Grummons told me
all about it.

06:38.844 --> 06:43.019
There's Mataman, the god
who leads you to happiness,

06:43.086 --> 06:45.186
and then there's you.

06:45.254 --> 06:47.521
Krungel, the other dog god,

06:47.589 --> 06:49.826
whose only purpose
is to ruin your life.

06:49.893 --> 06:53.298
Aside from what you think
I did to you today,

06:53.366 --> 06:55.734
when else have I ever been out
to "ruin your life"?

06:55.801 --> 06:57.402
Really?

06:57.470 --> 06:59.338
Leaving my wallet in front
of my neighbor's house?

06:59.406 --> 07:00.705
Oh, that was a good thing.

07:00.773 --> 07:02.339
I helped you stand up to him.

07:02.407 --> 07:04.541
Getting the shit kicked
out of me was a good thing?

07:04.609 --> 07:06.450
Or how about when you put
a shock collar on me?

07:06.510 --> 07:08.377
Or the night
I pulled down my pants

07:08.445 --> 07:09.845
to have sex
with a stuffed giraffe

07:09.912 --> 07:11.613
in front of a little kid?
Come on.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.581
Those were more like
practical jokes.

07:13.649 --> 07:14.984
I'm talking
about seriously ruining...

07:15.052 --> 07:15.918
Amanda.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.287
You know I had nothing to do
with that, Ryan.

07:21.354 --> 07:22.954
She was crazy.

07:23.022 --> 07:24.922
Or maybe she wasn't.

07:24.990 --> 07:27.124
Maybe you used
your special dog powers

07:27.192 --> 07:29.393
to secretly talk to her
and convince her to steal

07:29.461 --> 07:32.062
all that money and put it
in a bank account under my name.

07:33.331 --> 07:36.267
Whether I'm an evil god or not,

07:36.335 --> 07:39.935
rehashing the past isn't gonna
do you any good, Ryan.

07:40.003 --> 07:41.838
You've got to move on.

07:41.906 --> 07:43.440
"Move on"?

07:43.507 --> 07:45.310
You destroyed
the best relationship

07:45.378 --> 07:46.478
I've ever had.

07:47.878 --> 07:50.713
All right.

07:50.781 --> 07:54.384
If that's how you're gonna be,
then you've got to realize

07:54.451 --> 07:56.353
there are two sides
to every story.

07:56.421 --> 07:58.523
You want to know
what really happened today?

08:00.790 --> 08:03.191
Goldsmith's been
such a bitch lately.

08:05.729 --> 08:08.399
Come on, no way, dude!
Like you said,

08:08.467 --> 08:10.067
you were going off on your boss,

08:10.135 --> 08:12.101
so we drew that cartoon,

08:12.168 --> 08:13.802
and you put it in the envelope.

08:13.870 --> 08:15.705
"On-velope."

08:17.109 --> 08:18.010
Envelope.

08:18.078 --> 08:19.413
Oh, look at Bear over here.

08:19.481 --> 08:21.451
"I'm a year sober.

08:21.518 --> 08:23.451
"I can have just one.

08:23.519 --> 08:25.486
I'll be fine."

08:25.554 --> 08:28.523
Gross. It's in your hair.

08:30.470 --> 08:32.236
What a night, huh?

08:32.304 --> 08:35.267
I could really use a little skin
of the human that kicked me.

08:36.386 --> 08:38.692
Dude, give me a sip.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.962
Give you a sip?
There is nothing you can do

08:41.030 --> 08:43.799
to make me enable your disease.

08:44.415 --> 08:46.716
Put that back in your pants.

08:46.784 --> 08:48.652
Stop flaunting it.
We get it.

08:48.720 --> 08:49.854
You're well-endowed.

08:49.922 --> 08:51.459
Sweet bag.

08:51.526 --> 08:53.193
I didn't know they
made that in gray.

08:53.261 --> 08:54.394
Oh, man.

08:54.462 --> 08:55.996
Remember that drawing?

08:56.064 --> 08:57.297
Thank God I didn't mail it.

08:57.365 --> 08:58.805
Goldsmith would've
fired me for sure.

09:01.773 --> 09:03.341
Get your hands off of me.

09:03.408 --> 09:05.077
What the hell?

09:05.145 --> 09:06.746
I didn't do anything.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.081
Hey, take it easy, mate.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.784
After you were gone,

09:10.852 --> 09:13.390
I realized I had to take off
for an appointment.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.424
It's like, I love Bear,

09:15.491 --> 09:18.159
but am I in love with Bear?

09:20.362 --> 09:23.530
It's so good to be able to talk
to someone about this, Cheryl.

09:26.802 --> 09:28.270
It's great.

09:28.338 --> 09:30.138
This is the same length
you usually do?

09:30.205 --> 09:32.804
It just looks different.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.371
What do you think?

09:34.439 --> 09:35.606
That's not my dog.

09:35.674 --> 09:36.841
Where's Pickles?

09:36.909 --> 09:38.710
Pickles?

09:38.778 --> 09:40.812
- Pickles!
-  On my way out,

09:40.880 --> 09:43.982
I figured I may as well grab
a new gerbil for that

09:44.049 --> 09:45.951
little gerbil game
Bear and I like to play.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.520
Gerbil game?
That's sick, Wilfred.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.087
How is that sick?

09:49.155 --> 09:50.621
You stick the gerbil
up your asses.

09:50.689 --> 09:53.288
No!

09:53.356 --> 09:55.392
We cover the gerbil in some sort
of slippery substance,

09:55.460 --> 09:57.361
then we run around
and try to catch it.

09:57.428 --> 09:58.996
It's called Catch the Gerbil.

09:59.064 --> 10:00.866
It's just innocent fun, Ryan.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.170
Of course,
whoever catches the gerbil

10:04.238 --> 10:05.605
gets to put it up their ass.

10:05.673 --> 10:06.940
It feels so good.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.440
Get back to the story.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.342
I had to pick up a lubricant

10:10.409 --> 10:12.769
for Catch the Gerbil, so I
stopped by a convenience store.

10:17.019 --> 10:18.086
Dennis!

10:18.153 --> 10:19.354
I ran into Dennis

10:19.421 --> 10:20.422
trying to buy some alcohol.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.489
Your remember Dennis, right?

10:21.557 --> 10:23.158
My best friend?

10:23.226 --> 10:24.506
Well, Dennis and I are not only

10:24.561 --> 10:26.129
super, super close

10:26.197 --> 10:27.564
to the point
of being practically family,

10:27.632 --> 10:29.131
but I'm also his A.A. sponsor.

10:29.199 --> 10:31.366
You don't want
to do this, Dennis.

10:33.469 --> 10:35.137
You know,
Bear's back on the wagon.

10:37.343 --> 10:39.813
What do you mean, Bear just
texted you and said to meet

10:39.881 --> 10:42.248
in a hotel room in Van Nuys
and bring the booze

10:42.316 --> 10:44.619
'cause Bear's got an eight ball?

10:44.687 --> 10:46.456
Since my new haircut
was hideous--

10:46.523 --> 10:48.994
I'm not going back to Cheryl,
by the way--

10:49.062 --> 10:51.963
I needed to find something fast
to cover it up.

10:52.031 --> 10:54.101
And while I was at it, I figured

10:54.168 --> 10:56.336
I should pick up a gift
for Joffrey

10:56.403 --> 10:58.471
to congratulate him
on starting school.

10:58.539 --> 11:01.074
I pictured him standing
on the corner

11:01.142 --> 11:04.180
waiting for the bus
every morning, no fur.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.484
People don't know this
about Southern California,

11:06.552 --> 11:08.653
but it gets cold.

11:08.721 --> 11:12.022
I'd assumed the interview
was just a formality,

11:12.090 --> 11:15.827
so I walked over to the school
with Joffrey's gift.

11:15.894 --> 11:17.492
Is that when you took my bag?

11:17.560 --> 11:19.428
Right, almost forgot.

11:19.496 --> 11:21.264
That wasn't your bag.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.499
On my way over, I spotted
your exact same backpack

11:23.567 --> 11:25.167
in a shop window.

11:25.235 --> 11:28.070
Well, you know how much
I love that shade of gray.

11:28.138 --> 11:31.372
So, naturally, I snatched it--
four-claw discount--

11:31.440 --> 11:34.407
and moved all my stuff into it.

11:34.475 --> 11:35.809
What are you doing with my bag?
Ryan, wait.

11:35.877 --> 11:37.443
Give me my bag!
You...

11:37.511 --> 11:39.031
I was only trying
to get my bag back.

11:39.045 --> 11:40.779
Yours was still in the office.

11:40.847 --> 11:42.287
I wasn't out
to ruin your life, Ryan.

11:42.315 --> 11:46.119
It was all a complete
misunderstanding.

11:46.187 --> 11:50.085
I-I guess you're right.

11:50.153 --> 11:52.353
Everything in your story
makes total sense.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.055
Mmm.

11:54.122 --> 11:55.990
Except for one thing.

11:57.891 --> 12:00.123
I always write my initials
on the tags of my backpacks.

12:00.191 --> 12:01.592
Nerd.
This is my bag, Wilfred.

12:01.659 --> 12:03.428
You lied to me.

12:03.496 --> 12:04.698
What are you hiding?!
Aah!

12:04.765 --> 12:06.468
Nothing! I swear!

12:10.875 --> 12:12.545
Oh.

12:12.613 --> 12:14.381
You're-you're back.

12:14.449 --> 12:15.783
Yeah. I just got in.

12:15.851 --> 12:18.020
Are you...?
I'm alone.

12:18.089 --> 12:20.621
Uh, Drew decided
to stay back in Wisconsin.

12:20.689 --> 12:22.858
Look, I-I'm not in the mood
to talk about it.

12:22.926 --> 12:25.725
Can I just get Wilfred, please?

12:25.793 --> 12:29.695
Actually, uh, uh, I'm in the
middle of giving him a bath.

12:29.763 --> 12:31.397
Uh, can I drop him
off in a little bit?

12:31.465 --> 12:32.331
Sure.

12:36.702 --> 12:38.268
That was Jenna.

12:38.336 --> 12:40.435
As soon as you're ready
to tell the truth...

12:50.062 --> 12:51.663
Get me out of here, Wilfred!

12:51.731 --> 12:53.633
Good morning.

12:53.701 --> 12:56.133
It seems you've been a little

12:56.201 --> 12:58.502
tied up lately.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.638
Okay, that was lame. Do-over.

13:03.911 --> 13:05.910
Good morning.

13:05.978 --> 13:09.451
Have you been down here
learning the ropes?

13:09.519 --> 13:11.588
What? Th-That doesn't
even make any sense.

13:11.656 --> 13:12.556
You're losing
your edge, Wilfred.

13:12.623 --> 13:15.292
Okay, I got it.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.700
Since you're tied to a chair

13:20.768 --> 13:23.102
and you're probably super bored,

13:23.170 --> 13:27.076
how was your night,
Mr. Chairman of the Board?

13:27.143 --> 13:28.544
Nailed it.

13:28.612 --> 13:29.545
If you think you're gonna...

13:29.613 --> 13:31.447
Ow! What the...?!

13:31.515 --> 13:33.783
That's for calling me a mailman.

13:33.850 --> 13:36.991
I would never mail
a letter for you.

13:37.059 --> 13:39.261
Whatever you want from me,
you're not getting it.

13:39.329 --> 13:41.996
Oh, I don't want
anything from you, Ryan.

13:44.837 --> 13:48.443
Except to give you a little
taste of your own medicine.

13:50.112 --> 13:52.380
Prepare yourself

13:52.447 --> 13:55.849
for the most excruciatingly
painful experience

13:55.917 --> 13:58.217
of your life.

13:58.285 --> 14:02.055
Aah!

14:05.860 --> 14:07.894
Okay.

14:07.962 --> 14:10.298
I'm gonna go upstairs
and get my blowtorch

14:10.366 --> 14:13.134
and my bag of red ants.

14:13.201 --> 14:15.504
Uh, what?

14:15.571 --> 14:18.575
Y-You think this
has gone too far,

14:18.643 --> 14:21.444
and you don't want to be
a part of this anymore?

14:21.512 --> 14:23.281
What are you gonna do about it?!

14:23.349 --> 14:25.852
Huh?!

14:25.920 --> 14:28.187
You just do as you're told.

14:28.255 --> 14:30.422
Keep an eye on him
while I'm gone.

15:11.508 --> 15:13.776
Thanks, Bear.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.184
Are you guys ready to get
your fiery stings on?

15:22.754 --> 15:24.290
Aah!

15:24.357 --> 15:26.293
Why were you lying to me?!
What are you trying to hide?!

15:26.361 --> 15:27.462
I'll never tell!

15:31.566 --> 15:34.099
Is that the crinkling
of a dog food packet

15:34.166 --> 15:35.600
when it's not meal time?

15:39.073 --> 15:42.509
Aah! The unrealized
expectation of food!

15:42.577 --> 15:45.012
All right, all right!
I'll tell you everything!

15:46.949 --> 15:49.549
The only part of my story
I lied about

15:49.617 --> 15:51.785
was when I got to the school.

15:58.528 --> 16:01.328
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.367
How you doing?

16:06.435 --> 16:07.735
Good. How are you?

16:07.803 --> 16:10.040
Let's get out of here.
Yes, please.

16:10.108 --> 16:11.743
She's out of the institution?

16:12.978 --> 16:14.944
Apparently.

16:15.011 --> 16:17.045
She looked healthy.

16:17.112 --> 16:18.713
Sane.

16:18.780 --> 16:20.648
She and her boyfriend seemed

16:20.716 --> 16:23.217
happy together. I...

16:23.285 --> 16:26.720
I was worried, if you saw that,
it would make you upset.

16:26.788 --> 16:29.153
I was scrambling
to think of a way

16:29.221 --> 16:31.924
to get you out of there,
when I realized I had

16:31.993 --> 16:34.796
the perfect combination
of a deviant's delights--

16:34.864 --> 16:38.797
the gerbil, the lube,
the alcohol...

16:38.865 --> 16:41.131
the ski mask.

16:41.199 --> 16:43.366
When you went to the bathroom,
I stole your backpack

16:43.434 --> 16:45.701
and put my things in it.

16:45.769 --> 16:48.737
I had to get you
kicked out of there.

16:48.805 --> 16:50.771
I couldn't let you see her.

16:52.006 --> 16:53.273
I don't believe you.

16:54.575 --> 16:56.642
She was there, Ryan.

16:56.710 --> 16:58.210
I swear.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.912
Maybe she was.

16:59.979 --> 17:02.981
And maybe she is
healthy and sane.

17:03.049 --> 17:04.781
But a boyfriend?

17:04.849 --> 17:06.651
A trickster god
obviously couldn't stand

17:06.718 --> 17:09.619
to see me rekindle the
relationship he destroyed.

17:09.688 --> 17:13.256
That could only bring
me happiness, right?

17:13.324 --> 17:14.723
What are you doing?

17:14.791 --> 17:16.227
The opposite of what
you want me to.

17:17.395 --> 17:18.996
Ryan, stop!

17:19.063 --> 17:21.965
You don't want to see her!

17:43.756 --> 17:47.125
Amanda.

17:47.193 --> 17:51.034
Wait!
Look, I know this is awkward,

17:51.102 --> 17:53.603
I can't do this, Ryan!

17:59.665 --> 18:02.652
At the hospital, they gave me
all sorts of different things

18:03.015 --> 18:05.481
to try and help me.

18:05.549 --> 18:08.817
Medication, therapy...

18:08.885 --> 18:12.256
other... stronger
types of treatment.

18:15.992 --> 18:19.631
Once we found the right
combination, I got better.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.832
And after a year, the court

18:21.900 --> 18:23.933
let my parents take me in.

18:25.403 --> 18:27.440
I wanted to call you.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.109
So badly.

18:30.411 --> 18:33.512
But our relationship,

18:33.579 --> 18:35.513
it triggered something.

18:35.580 --> 18:38.949
Those highs and lows,
I-I can't handle them again.

18:40.379 --> 18:43.121
I know it doesn't look
like I'm doing so great,

18:43.188 --> 18:46.322
but I am on a good path.

18:46.390 --> 18:47.973
And if I want to get healthy

18:48.093 --> 18:51.557
and keep moving
forward on that path,

18:51.625 --> 18:54.558
I can't look back.

18:54.626 --> 18:56.860
I can't have you in my
life right now, Ryan.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.796
Amanda...
I'm sorry.

19:16.138 --> 19:18.373
You saw her in the halls.

19:18.440 --> 19:22.075
I didn't want you
to see her like that.

19:22.143 --> 19:24.332
You were trying to protect me.

19:25.014 --> 19:26.815
And I was thinking,

19:26.882 --> 19:28.548
if you wanted to patch
things up with Kristen,

19:28.616 --> 19:31.118
you could tell her Drew put
all that stuff in your bag.

19:31.186 --> 19:33.756
You know, to make you look pervy
as revenge for kissing his wife.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.292
That's crazy.

19:35.359 --> 19:36.960
You're right.
No one would ever believe

19:37.028 --> 19:37.996
Drew's that smart.

19:39.633 --> 19:41.469
Although...

19:41.536 --> 19:43.369
it's my best option.

19:46.140 --> 19:47.675
Listen.

19:47.742 --> 19:50.379
I've been doing
some thinking, too.

19:50.447 --> 19:53.746
Maybe your version
of the story is true.

19:53.814 --> 19:56.915
Maybe you haven't been
undermining me since we met.

19:58.217 --> 20:00.218
Either way,

20:00.285 --> 20:03.119
I'm done punishing
you for the past.

20:03.186 --> 20:04.855
I'm done looking back.

20:06.993 --> 20:08.661
I'm just gonna need

20:08.728 --> 20:11.394
some time to figure things out.

20:18.308 --> 20:19.875
Stay.

20:21.177 --> 20:22.877
Until I know for sure.

20:24.446 --> 20:27.081
I'm sorry.
