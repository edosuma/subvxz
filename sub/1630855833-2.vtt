Morning, pancake.
Sorry, did I wake you up?

00:47.465 --> 00:50.340
I didn't sleep that great.
It's Saturday morning.

00:50.468 --> 00:54.094
So tonight is
Saturday night, which is...

00:54.221 --> 00:56.180
You-know-what. Yup.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.974
Feeling a little...
Stressed, I guess.

00:59.101 --> 01:02.144
Should we do that thing
that calms me down? Yeah? Okay.

You're supposed to come in.

-[sylvester] rudy, breakfast.
-Okay. Coming.

01:11.864 --> 01:15.199
I made something
pretty egg-cellent for us.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.117
It's eggs.
That's why I said that.

01:17.203 --> 01:20.037
I, uh, looked up
the menu for the restaurant

01:20.206 --> 01:21.830
We're going to tonight, and...

01:21.990 --> 01:22.915
They have breadsticks.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.374
Oh, yum. That's great.

01:24.502 --> 01:27.127
Yep. And dipping sauces,
if you can believe it.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.504
You excited? I'm excited.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.130
Uh-huh. Yeah. Yes.

01:30.216 --> 01:31.548
And now I'm familiar
with the menu,

01:31.634 --> 01:34.134
So I can just relax
and enjoy the evening.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.969
Focus on having fun
with everybody.

01:36.097 --> 01:38.097
'cause it's gonna be so fun.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.807
-For sure.
-You jazzed?

01:39.892 --> 01:42.351
-Very jazzed.
-Jazzed twins, aren't we?

01:42.478 --> 01:44.228
Okay, I'm gonna go get
the car washed,

01:44.355 --> 01:46.555
And then I need to exchange
a shirt at the mall.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.856
-Y-you want to come?
-Sure.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.274
Decided to get a size bigger.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.151
Been putting on a few muscles
lately. Little bit.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.903
-Uh-huh.
-Is this muscle bigger?

01:52.988 --> 01:54.446
-Oh, y-yes.
-Feel it.

01:54.532 --> 01:56.824
Whoa... Oh, wait.
No, that's your elbow.

01:56.867 --> 01:57.908
Whoa.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.076
Yup, that's 'cause I installed

01:59.203 --> 02:00.452
-That pull-up bar.
-Mm-hmm.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.121
I mean, I had
someone else install it for me.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.331
But I use it.
Couple times a month.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.416
Hey, dad, can we can
stop at the magic store

02:06.502 --> 02:08.669
On the way to the mall? I want
to get a new trick for tonight.

02:08.838 --> 02:11.964
Oh, right, of course.
The main event of these dinners.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.007
Tableside magic
by the amazing rudy.

02:14.093 --> 02:16.552
-I mean, I-I try to bring it.
-And you do bring it.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.679
Now, can you make
my armpit eczema disappear?

02:18.764 --> 02:21.807
[chuckles] just a little joke.
It's-it's under control.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.600
-Pretty much.
-Yeah, it is. Fist bump.

02:23.686 --> 02:25.686
-Oh, wait. No, I thought--
-yeah, I went for the,

02:25.771 --> 02:27.563
-I was going for the high-five,
so, sorry.
-I thought we were fist-bumping.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.815
Yeah. Okay, no,
you said fist bump, so let's...

02:29.942 --> 02:30.983
[both grunting]

02:31.068 --> 02:32.901
Hold on. Here, here we go.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.611
Okay, that's...
N-now you're just grabbing my--

02:34.655 --> 02:37.656
Okay, I'm gonna...
Uh, here I go, I'm gonna let go.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.451
No, no, no.
You got to stay in the car.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.329
A magician never lets people
come with him into a magic shop.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.747
Right. Right.
Uh, you need money?

02:45.875 --> 02:49.042
I'm good. I've still got
$13 left over from mowing lawns.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.502
-Well, I mean... One lawn.
-Yeah.

02:50.588 --> 02:52.921
It was a fun way to learn
I'm allergic to grass.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.423
I'm glad
they found me when they did.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.925
-Hmm...
-[esmeralda]
is that rudy the cutie?

02:57.011 --> 02:58.844
Oh, hi, esmeralda. Yeah it's me.

02:58.929 --> 03:02.306
-Horace here, too?
-No, he's at a cape conference
in cape cod.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.382
Told him to bring me back
something flashy.

03:04.476 --> 03:05.934
Looking for anything
in particular?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.645
Well, looking for
something that can really wow

03:08.731 --> 03:11.815
-A group and work in
a restaurant situation.
-Okay.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.525
So maybe it could be

03:13.611 --> 03:14.693
Kind of an icebreaker,

03:14.820 --> 03:16.361
Maybe sort
of a conversation piece.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.905
Just, you know,
a magic trick that brings

03:18.032 --> 03:19.323
All of humanity together,

03:19.450 --> 03:21.742
Even in the most awkward
of fine dining experiences.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.994
-Under $13, please.
-Hmm...

03:24.163 --> 03:25.662
All right, teeny houdini.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.915
We just got a new
sleeve scarf trick in.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.208
Two more scarves in this one.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.792
-Mm...
-Okay, how about rings?

03:30.920 --> 03:33.712
-Yeah, uh, I don't know.
-Okay, let me think.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.256
-Is this a fancy restaurant?
-They serve breadsticks.

03:36.342 --> 03:39.051
Hmm. Oh, I have just the thing.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.260
Sodium polyacrylate.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.262
Sodium poly... What'd you say?

03:42.348 --> 03:44.056
Step over here and I'll
show you how it works.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.807
It'll be perfect
for the setting.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.267
It's $8.99 plus tax.

03:47.353 --> 03:49.436
Leaves you a little
left over for a cocktail.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.230
-You're 21, right?
-I turned 35 last month,

03:51.357 --> 03:52.814
But thank you. [chuckles]

03:52.900 --> 03:55.734
Just kidding.
Oh, it feels good to laugh.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.905
[sylvester]
so, uh, rudy, a-about tonight...

04:00.032 --> 04:01.365
Yep. I'm jazzed. Whoo!

04:01.492 --> 04:04.034
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, me, too. Me, too.
-Great.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.819
But I-I-I did want to say,

04:05.913 --> 04:08.205
I know these dinners,
you know, um...

04:08.290 --> 04:10.332
You-you've always been
a trooper, and, uh,

04:10.459 --> 04:12.251
And-and-and-and I know
tonight is gonna

04:12.294 --> 04:14.336
Be a little different, you know,
uh, guest-list-wise.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.880
And, oop, okay, it's our turn.

04:16.966 --> 04:17.965
All right. Here we go.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.049
-[loud whirring]
-I-I-I was...

04:19.134 --> 04:20.634
I was just saying, I-I mean,

04:20.761 --> 04:24.346
I just... I-I-I wanted to say...
Uh, this is so loud.

04:24.473 --> 04:25.597
Yeah, it is!

04:25.724 --> 04:29.309
-Yeah, I-I think
paul's very nice!
-What?!

04:29.478 --> 04:32.896
And-and-and we all love you
so very much!

04:33.023 --> 04:34.147
-What?!
-And we love--

04:34.233 --> 04:35.357
-What?!
-I said...

04:35.526 --> 04:36.692
[sylvester]
hi.

04:36.819 --> 04:38.610
Uh, can I exchange this
for a size up?

04:38.696 --> 04:39.903
[clerk]
of course.

04:39.989 --> 04:41.029
[sylvester]
put a chin-up bar in my house,

04:41.198 --> 04:42.948
And my sleeves have noticed.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.783
-[clerk] what?
-[sylvester] nothing. Nothing.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.035
Hey, dad, can I meet you
at better off head?

04:47.162 --> 04:48.662
-Oh, uh, th-the kiosk?
-Yeah.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.498
Maybe I'll wear a hat tonight.
Little head candy never hurt.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.833
Okay. Yeah, sure. Hey.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.377
Don't try on
any hats I wouldn't try on.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.712
I know. No berets.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.339
They just don't work with
our family's head shape.

04:59.425 --> 05:02.342
Hmm.
Not really me, but not<i> not</i> me.

05:02.428 --> 05:04.511
Ooh, now that's
a daring danny.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.096
[tina] people made wishes
with those coins, louise.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.515
But what if their wish
was for us

05:08.600 --> 05:10.600
To use that change to get
a giant chocolate chip cookie?

05:10.686 --> 05:13.520
My wish is just to soak
my barking dogs for a minute.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.315
Okay, kids. Your dad bought
his new special pillow.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.649
For my special neck.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.818
We love that you can't turn
your head all the way.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.194
-We get away with so much.
-Hmm.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.904
Come on.
Let's go pick out grandma

05:22.990 --> 05:24.239
And grandpa's anniversary gift.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.407
Okay.
Tina was thinking

05:25.534 --> 05:26.742
About stealing money
from the fountain.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.744
Wait, what? No, I wasn't.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.164
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.083
[linda]
we could get 'em
these glass turtles with

05:35.210 --> 05:36.710
The red heart
in between that says

05:36.837 --> 05:38.045
"we're turtle-y in love."

05:38.130 --> 05:39.463
-[tina] classy.
-Or...

05:39.631 --> 05:41.590
The wooden paperweight
with the eiffel tower carved

05:41.717 --> 05:44.343
Into it that says
"paperweights are for lovers"?

05:44.428 --> 05:45.802
-Trashy.
-[rudy] hey, guys.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.054
Rude-a-than.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.764
What brings you to the mall,
young man?

05:48.891 --> 05:50.891
-Oh, I was just looking at hats.
-In all the wrong places?

05:50.976 --> 05:54.644
-Just kidding. The mall's
a good place to find a hat.
-And a spouse.

05:54.772 --> 05:55.812
Okay, rudy,
if you were my parents,

05:55.898 --> 05:56.938
Which one would you want?

05:57.024 --> 05:57.898
-Huh?
-You're here,

05:58.025 --> 05:58.982
You're a part of this now.

05:59.068 --> 06:01.276
Oh, uh, they're both confusing.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.611
-[linda huffs]
-[coughs] turtles.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.446
Let's just pick something
and pay for it, please.

06:04.606 --> 06:07.366
We got to get home and make
my gene-got-a-b-minus dinner.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.993
Because I got my
science grade up from an f-plus.

06:10.079 --> 06:13.789
-Aw, my little bunsen burner.
-Guy gets one b-minus.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.123
I get to pick any dinner I want,

06:15.209 --> 06:17.376
And I picked
loaded baked potato lasagna,

06:17.461 --> 06:18.752
Which is something I made up

06:18.837 --> 06:20.879
When I was definitely
paying attention in science.

06:20.997 --> 06:23.298
-Are you sure you don't want
something else?
-It's my day.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.966
-It's his day, dad.
-Yup.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.260
It's just, just, I'm not sure
lasagna should include

06:27.346 --> 06:30.097
A loaded baked potato
or a cornbread crust.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.681
Rudy, you should
come over for dinner.

06:31.767 --> 06:34.434
I think it's gonna be one of the
worst foods we've ever tried.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.020
Uh, actually, I can't come.
I have plans.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.814
Ooh. Plans. Fancy.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.941
-Look at you.
-Are you going to the opera?

06:41.068 --> 06:42.067
Watch out for phantoms.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.485
No, it's just a family thing.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.278
That's okay,
I'm sure gene will talk my mom

06:45.364 --> 06:47.447
Into making gross food
some other time, too.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.325
Thanks. Well, better get back
to better off head.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.743
My dad's meeting me there.
See you at school.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.203
I'm not sure I'm gonna
go anymore,

06:53.288 --> 06:54.913
-But if I do, I'll look you up.
-Okay.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.248
Yeah, and I probably
don't<i> need</i> to go

06:56.333 --> 06:59.251
Because I'm
so smart now, but maybe.

07:00.129 --> 07:02.546
-All right, here we go.
-Yep.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.923
Our monthly "we're still
a family" dinner with your mom.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.299
But now with my friend vicki

07:06.385 --> 07:08.260
And your mom's friend paul.
Boyfriend.

07:08.429 --> 07:09.761
-Boy who's a friend.
-Right.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.304
Yeah, it's gonna be
a great night.

07:11.432 --> 07:14.015
Yep. Yeah. Great. Just
all of us just hanging out.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.518
Hey, do you think I should,
uh, tuck my shirt in?

07:16.562 --> 07:17.644
It is long.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.313
There's just a...
It's just a lot of fabric.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.941
Tucked in, it looks like
I got puffy underwear on.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.192
Cool puffy underwear.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.861
Maybe I blouse it a little bit,
like this?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.696
Should I not wear this hat?

07:27.781 --> 07:30.365
What? No. Confident conrad,
it's a, it's a great look.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.033
Yeah, but...
Well, maybe I won't.

07:32.161 --> 07:33.285
No, now I'm going untucked.
Untucked.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.995
-Okay.
-Maybe, maybe yes on the hat.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.413
-I mean, it's hard to tell.
-Did this get longer?

07:36.498 --> 07:37.956
I mean, it's, like,
down to my knees now.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.624
Or I could do hat off.
Maybe I just carry it.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.168
You know what,
we both look great. Let's go.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.752
We're leaving the condo.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.879
I, I have to poop.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.005
Oh, boy, really?

07:45.132 --> 07:46.256
You know what,
I need to go, too.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.008
-Untucking.
-Okay, can I go first?

07:48.051 --> 07:49.259
-No, that's...
-And cutting in line,
cutting in line.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.594
-Excuse me.
-Dad, ah, you pushed me!

07:50.679 --> 07:51.887
I'm sorry. You know how I am.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.138
Play music. It's gonna be bad.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.056
-[rudy] turn on the fan.
-[sylvester cries out]

08:06.153 --> 08:08.653
-How's the weather back there?
-What?

08:08.780 --> 08:12.482
Just... How's the temperature?
You need some ac or heat?

08:12.534 --> 08:14.284
-It's good.
-Good.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.244
Oh, oh, good,
you got the backpack.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.537
Glad you didn't forget it.

08:17.623 --> 08:20.040
Your literal "bag of tricks."
[chuckles]

08:20.125 --> 08:21.416
It wouldn't be a family dinner

08:21.502 --> 08:23.001
Without the latest
amazing rudy trick.

08:23.086 --> 08:26.046
I've actually been trying out
rudy the illusionary visionary.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.590
-Ooh, chills.
-Yeah, not to build it up
too much.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.383
Sure, sure. No. Of course.

08:30.469 --> 08:33.303
So glad we do these dinners,
me, you and your mom.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.888
And now we're adding
some more people,

08:34.973 --> 08:36.056
But that's good, too, right?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.516
I mean, paul and vicki.

08:37.601 --> 08:38.600
And me and your mom.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.435
I-I mean, I mean,
not paul-and-vicki.

08:40.521 --> 08:43.271
Your mom and paul,
and me and vicki.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.982
A-and you, of course.
You're the guest of honor.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.609
But not a guest
'cause you're our child.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.402
If anyone's a guest, it's vicki

08:49.488 --> 08:51.613
'cause she and I haven't been
seeing each other very long.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.989
Dad, you sound kinda nervous.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.325
Ha, yeah, I guess I am a little.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.410
Got the motormouth
going there, didn't I?

08:57.529 --> 08:58.620
Uh, not in a bad way.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.247
But, okay, if I do that
at dinner

09:00.332 --> 09:02.249
Just kick me
under the table, please.

09:02.334 --> 09:03.625
-Okay, dad.
-Yeah, but not too hard.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.043
You know how my calves bruise.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.294
That's what makes them
interesting.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.630
Beautiful rainbow calves.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.131
Thanks, pal.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.927
[sylvester]
so... [clears throat]

09:14.054 --> 09:16.012
Uh, so, should we get a drink
at the bar?

09:16.098 --> 09:17.347
[vicki]
I'd love a drink.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.432
[rudy's mom]
oh, it looks kind of crowded.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.434
[paul]
I could try and get us drinks
and bring 'em back here.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.395
[sylvester]
oh. Oh, that's...
That's nice of you.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.564
I-I'm good.
Or unless you... You want to?

09:25.691 --> 09:27.899
If-if you are going,
I'd take a glass of red wine,

09:28.068 --> 09:29.276
If they have a, uh...

09:29.361 --> 09:31.027
Vicki, what's the...
What's the red I like?

09:31.113 --> 09:32.279
[vicki]
I have no idea.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.072
[sylvester] [laughs]
okay, maybe a margarita.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.283
Or you know what? It's so hard
to carry four drinks.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.159
Just don't worry about it.
It's actually... I'm-I'm good.

09:38.287 --> 09:39.703
[hostess]
stieblitz party of five?

09:39.788 --> 09:41.413
[sylvester]
oh, that's us,
just like the show.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.665
You know, the tv show
<i> party of five?</i>

09:43.834 --> 09:45.375
-[hostess]
I'm sorry, I don't know it.
-Sure you do.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.127
It was really popular
in the '90s.

09:47.212 --> 09:50.130
-[hostess] I was born in 2002.
-Oh, uh, all right.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.091
Let's just go to the table.

09:55.887 --> 09:58.096
♪ ♪

10:00.767 --> 10:02.559
Ah!

10:02.686 --> 10:04.644
-Ta-da!
-[sylvester] oh.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.772
Oh.

10:07.858 --> 10:10.108
[sylvester laughs]

10:15.449 --> 10:17.282
Oh.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.492
[laughter]

10:23.531 --> 10:27.250
Uh, welcome, everyone. I am
rudy the illusionary visionary.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.544
-I love it.
-And now, empty cup, right?

10:29.630 --> 10:32.839
Please pass it around
and confirm that this is in fact

10:32.924 --> 10:34.674
A normal plastic cup.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.468
-Yup, empty.
-Beer pong, anyone?

10:36.553 --> 10:38.303
-Totally normal.
-Couldn't be more empty.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.055
And now I take
this totally normal water here.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.473
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.892
And I will pour it into the cup,
say a few magic words.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.477
Mandy patinkin, mandy patinkin.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.355
I will turn it over,
and the water will be gone.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.315
-Whoa.
-Uh-oh.
-Oh. Oh. Oh, my god.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.484
-Oh, boy.
-My suede slacks.
-I'm sorry.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.736
I'm sorry. That wasn't supposed
to happen like that.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.279
I didn't do enough banter.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.281
I was supposed
to wait 30 seconds.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.992
That's okay, honey.
I loved it, loved the trick.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.744
Can we, uh,
get some napkins over here?

11:02.829 --> 11:04.079
But it didn't work.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.413
Anything I can help you with,
folks?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.165
Uh, it's just a little spill,
no big deal.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.417
A towel or some napkins
would be great.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.378
-What is this stuff?
-Sodium polyacrylate.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.880
-What?
-I'm not supposed
to reveal my tricks.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.591
It-it-it's okay
to-to tell, if it stains.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.344
Sodium polyacrylate.
I-I don't think it stains.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.054
It's what they put in diapers.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.681
-It's what?
-It's what?
-I was supposed to wait

11:22.766 --> 11:24.349
For the powder
to absorb the water.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.226
Hey, hey, hey,
don't-don't sweat it.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.311
How about you try the trick
again after dessert?

11:28.397 --> 11:30.313
No, I can't.
I only brought one packet.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.149
I got to go to the bathroom.
Excuse me.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.034
[whimpering]

11:43.078 --> 11:45.328
[cries softly, sniffles]

11:56.925 --> 11:59.718
[sniffling]

12:01.430 --> 12:02.971
Are you all right?

12:03.098 --> 12:04.597
Oh, yup, totally. That's okay.

12:04.725 --> 12:08.560
Th-thank you for...
Nice to meet you. [grunts]

12:10.814 --> 12:12.105
[sniffles]

12:12.232 --> 12:14.149
[gene]
and good night to you. Mwah.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.984
And good night to you. Mwah.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.777
And good night to you.
Mwah.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.406
And good night to you. Mwah.
And good night to you. Mwah.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.074
And to you, kevin. Mwah.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.576
Good night to you most of all.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.786
-Gene, please stop kissing
the ketchups.
-Never!

12:26.872 --> 12:28.246
-Good night, kevin.
-Aw, kevin.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.956
-Rudy?!
-None of them are named rudy.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.207
No, look, it's rudy.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.042
He must have come
for dinner after all.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.544
Rudy, come in.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.463
I mean, actually don't come in.
We're coming out.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.715
I got to go take the
super lasagna out of the oven.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.009
What happened to your dinner
thing? You get stood up?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.303
Oh, it got moved around.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.472
Great. Now you can have
gross lasagna with us.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.766
Yeah. Go on up.
Did your parents drop you off?

12:47.893 --> 12:50.059
Oh, uh, yup.
Yeah, they dropped me off.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.437
Okay, I'll just finish
by myself.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.606
Great idea, dad.
That's why you're the boss.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.942
Look at that, rudy. I can't wait
to see her come out.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.819
-It's beautiful.
-Isn't it?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.404
My creation, come to life.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.032
This must be how dad felt
when I was being born.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.159
-My lasagna is crowning!
-[bob] whoa.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.911
Wow. Lot... Lot of smells.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.704
Some I don't understand?

13:09.748 --> 13:12.373
Okay, time to take this thing
out of the oven.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.875
Whew! Ugh. Heavy.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.251
It weighs, like, 50 pounds.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.045
That's the ideal weight
for a lasagna.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.463
-[bob] hmm.
-[gene clears throat]

13:18.590 --> 13:20.632
Before we dig in, I just want
to say a few words.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.551
[clears throat] I could never
have made this dream a reality

13:23.637 --> 13:25.845
Without the people who were
there to help me along the way.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.348
Mom, who's the wind
beneath my noodles

13:28.433 --> 13:30.517
-And the boss of all my sauce.
-[linda] aw.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.727
[gene]
dad for not standing
in my way with mom.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.270
-[bob] hmm.
-[gene] tina and louise

13:34.397 --> 13:36.356
For letting me shine brighter
than you ever could.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.526
Rudy, love you, bro.
Now let's eat!

13:40.529 --> 13:42.070
Okay, focus group.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.864
I want everyone's reactions,
summed up in one word.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.157
-Mom, go.
-Uh... A lot.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.534
Okay, that's two words,

13:47.619 --> 13:49.369
But I'll let it slide
because you made it.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.703
-Dad.
-So much.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.331
-Wrong. Louise.
-Food, question mark?

13:53.416 --> 13:55.041
Strike that from the record.
Tina.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.418
Uh, lot of cheese and bacon

13:57.504 --> 13:59.963
And noodles and red sauce
and ground beef

14:00.090 --> 14:01.464
And chives and sour cream.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.341
And, um,
is that a piece of bagel?

14:03.426 --> 14:05.218
Yup. Cinnamon raisin.
One word, please.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.678
Okay, I'll say... Bagel.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.930
I feel like you guys aren't
rising to the challenge.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.266
-Rudy, reaction.
-One word? Groundbreaking.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.393
It's definitely better
than what I ordered.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.395
-What you ordered?
-Ordered...

14:15.480 --> 14:16.604
Myself to eat at home.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.315
I said, "rudy, I order you
to eat this food."

14:19.359 --> 14:20.608
Okay.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.111
Rudy, are you sure
your parents know where you are?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.321
Oh, yeah.
I-I-I asked them

14:25.448 --> 14:28.283
If I could come over,
and they said, "oh, yeah."

14:28.368 --> 14:30.451
Okay, but maybe I should
give 'em just a quick call

14:30.537 --> 14:32.161
And check what time
they want you back.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.163
What's your mom's number?
Or your dad's?

14:34.249 --> 14:35.540
Or who are you with right now?

14:35.667 --> 14:38.084
Oh, um, I'm wi-with--

14:38.211 --> 14:40.003
You're with your dad
this weekend, right?

14:40.171 --> 14:41.379
He was at the mall?

14:41.464 --> 14:43.006
Yeah, either.
You can call either.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.800
They're-they're together.
I mean, they're not together,

14:45.927 --> 14:47.051
But it's complicated.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.387
-But if you had to pick one--
-to call.

14:49.472 --> 14:52.348
Yeah, to call.
Not pick one, like pick one.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.058
God. Sorry.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.103
He's been in there a while.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.439
Did he eat something funky
earlier?

14:59.524 --> 15:00.773
I don't think so.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.483
I know he pooped
before we left the house.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.902
We both did. I'm sorry.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.863
-Maybe I should go check on him.
-Uh, give him another minute.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.449
You know, he's at that age where
he doesn't always want us to--

15:09.534 --> 15:10.742
Right, yeah, yes.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.201
What was it called again?
The stuff?

15:12.329 --> 15:14.829
Oh, um,
poly-carbonated something.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.915
-Sodium poly-calca... Ah.
-Sodium poly-cal... Cal... Uh.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.833
-[both] mm-hmm.
-Did he say it's from diapers?

15:18.960 --> 15:21.336
-Probably not from used ones.
-Did he?

15:21.463 --> 15:23.880
It's going to voice mail.
Oh, the mailbox is full.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.256
Who decides when it's full?

15:25.342 --> 15:26.799
The little man
who lives inside the phone?

15:26.885 --> 15:30.011
Well, this has been fun,
but, uh, I should get going,

15:30.096 --> 15:32.263
-Get back to my family.
-But you just got here.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.140
-Is it the lasagna?
-[gasps] impossible.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.558
Well, how are you gonna
get home?

15:35.685 --> 15:38.311
I think it's a little too late
to walk by yourself.

15:38.429 --> 15:40.313
Is it the smell?
There is an odd smell.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.441
-Father!
-No. No! I-I just, um...

15:43.526 --> 15:45.735
I kinda, I kinda...

15:45.820 --> 15:48.446
Walked out of dinner
with my mom

15:48.531 --> 15:51.658
And her boyfriend and my dad
and his... Vicki.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.868
We were all eating dinner
together for the first time,

15:53.995 --> 15:56.162
Which, I guess, is how
family dinners are gonna be

15:56.331 --> 15:58.665
From now on, and I...
I did a magic trick,

15:58.750 --> 16:01.209
And it was gonna be pretty good,
but I messed it up.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.710
And I, and I guess...

16:02.796 --> 16:05.546
Yeah, uh, technically,
I ran away.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.081
-Wait, what?!
-Oh, boy.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.634
Um, they think I'm in
the bathroom at the restaurant,

16:09.719 --> 16:11.302
-So, uh, I should go.
-Oh.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.722
Uh, or they might be
calling the police right now?

16:14.808 --> 16:16.265
I mean, sometimes

16:16.351 --> 16:17.517
I take a pretty long time
in the bathroom.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.143
Brother, don't ever let them
make you feel bad

16:19.187 --> 16:20.561
For sitting through the credits.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.563
I'm gonna... Try your dad again.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.232
And may-maybe your mom, too.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.150
Just to let 'em know
that you're safe.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.735
Right, yeah, right.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.612
And why don't
I just drive rudy back

16:29.698 --> 16:31.322
And walk him in?
That'll be fine.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.449
Yeah, that-that-that makes
a lot of sense.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.368
-Yeah.
-Uh, thank...
Thanks for having me.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.204
-It was really nice.
-Yeah, of course, hon.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.289
I'm just gonna wait out here.
[mutters]

16:40.375 --> 16:42.000
If it's okay, I just... Yeah.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.127
I'll pack you
a lasagna doggie bag.

16:44.254 --> 16:47.463
How many pounds you want?
Five? Ten? Hmm?

16:51.428 --> 16:54.387
Okay, bob will drop him
off soon. Yeah. Uh-huh.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.889
Okay, bye. Did you find
the keys yet, bob?

16:56.975 --> 16:59.684
Almost. I'm sure
they're gonna show up somehow.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.352
-Keys do that, right?
-Yeah.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.354
-Now have you found them?
-Or now?

17:03.440 --> 17:06.357
I promise to let everyone know
when I find the keys.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.276
-Okay. How about now?
-Yeah. No, tina.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.653
Your folks are okay,
just a little rattled.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.321
I mean, surprised.
Totally fine.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.449
Hopefully,
vicki's pants aren't stained.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.367
I got sodium polyacrylate
on 'em.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.786
-Is that drugs?
-No, it's from the magic trick

17:18.830 --> 17:20.079
I tried to do at dinner.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.457
Oh, I'm sure
vicki's pants are fine, hon.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.208
It's not like they were suede
or something, right?

17:24.335 --> 17:26.127
-They were suede.
-[gene gasps]

17:26.212 --> 17:27.503
Okay, it's fine.
It's fine, honey.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.297
-[rudy sighs heavily]
-[bob] okay, I found the keys.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.257
-Great job, dad.
-Thank you.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.176
-Do you still have them?
-Yeah. Yes.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.428
-Um, can I walk rudy back?
-What?
-What?

17:35.513 --> 17:37.597
Can I walk back
to the restaurant with him?

17:37.682 --> 17:38.973
-Where is it?
-It's, uh...

17:39.100 --> 17:41.559
It-it-it's really close,
I, uh, I-I think.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.603
I-I walked.
I was walking.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.021
And-and not crying, at all.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.939
Th-then I was here, and...

17:47.067 --> 17:48.107
It's that way a few blocks.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.192
-Oh, plate and fork?
-Yeah.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.277
-How is it?
-I don't know.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.820
Kind of like a place
where adults eat food?

17:52.906 --> 17:55.782
Sounds like a hoot. Probably a
good thing if I tag along, huh?

17:55.867 --> 17:57.533
Stay for dinner,
make amusing small talk?

17:57.660 --> 17:59.118
Oh, really? I mean, yeah.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.703
If you come,
you can have half my meal,

18:00.789 --> 18:03.372
And then my dad can drop you off
here on our way home.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.541
Sure, that lasagna was more like
an appetizer anyway.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.586
-Oh, please.
-So I'll walk rudes
back to his foods?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.996
-Sound good?
-Uh, oh, uh...

18:11.091 --> 18:13.508
-It's kind of dark.
-Yeah, it's not a problem.

18:13.635 --> 18:14.759
I can get my brass knuckles.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.511
Anyone messes with us
on the way,

18:16.596 --> 18:19.013
You dazzle 'em with magic,
and I'll dazzle 'em with pain.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.057
-That's my girl.
-You have brass knuckles?

18:21.142 --> 18:23.017
Yeah. Christmas? Last year?

18:23.061 --> 18:25.019
Why did santa bring those
to you?

18:25.063 --> 18:26.479
Well, maybe santa's
from the streets.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.440
Santa wasn't worried
about siblings being knuckled?

18:29.526 --> 18:31.150
-Dad.
-Bob.
-Okay, you can go.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.027
May-maybe no brass knuckles,
though.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.654
-Just bare fists?
-Come on, rudy.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.697
Well, bye.
An-and thanks again.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.199
I'll call your parents
and tell 'em

18:38.326 --> 18:39.534
You and louise are
on your way over,

18:39.661 --> 18:41.410
And, uh, oh, louise,
let me give you some money

18:41.496 --> 18:43.412
So you can pay for your food.
Bob, you got any money?

18:43.498 --> 18:46.415
-How much money?
-Um, eight dollars?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.876
Okay, uh, I'm sure
there's a soup or something.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.378
I'm not getting soup.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.088
But I'll give 'em the eight
bucks, and I'll tell 'em

18:52.173 --> 18:53.089
You're good for the rest.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.215
You think they'll believe it?

18:54.300 --> 18:55.508
You can work out a payment plan.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.801
Okay. We're going. Goodbye.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.387
-You two, uh, have fun.
-Yeah. Bye.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.806
-Don't you have a lasagna
to finish?
-Yes.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.934
-Oh, god.
-I've thought of her
every moment I've been away.

I just wanted to watch.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.279
What kind of desserts
do they have at this place?

19:16.406 --> 19:18.197
I'm not sure.
They've got breadsticks.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.366
Okay. They can put sugar
on breadsticks, right?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.743
I bet they can.
It's a pretty classy place.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.328

19:31.462 --> 19:33.171
So what was this magic trick
you did?

19:33.298 --> 19:35.590
Making water disappear.
It would have been pretty cool.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.550
Well, you got any other tricks?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.135
You can saw me in half
if you want to.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.428
I think I could take it.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.221
Oh. You could help me do
"who's got the coin?"

-You could be my secret partner.
-Sure.
