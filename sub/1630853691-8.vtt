00:05.200 --> 00:07.440
Are you sure we shouldn't
have read 'Autumn'?

00:07.480 --> 00:09.080
It's a play about dementia,

00:09.160 --> 00:11.640
what theater would want
to produce it?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.679
I love you.
-Great.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.160
I really love you.
You know how I know?

00:16.239 --> 00:17.079
How?

00:17.160 --> 00:18.480
Because you're not hot

00:18.519 --> 00:19.679
I meant to send it
to someone else.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.160
Don't send it at all!

00:21.239 --> 00:23.160
You know you could lose
your job because of that?

00:23.239 --> 00:25.120
I already have.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.320
Opening night
is in one week,

00:27.519 --> 00:30.280
so if the next run
is no good,

00:30.320 --> 00:31.320
I'll have you replaced

00:31.399 --> 00:32.679
and you'll be out
the frickin' door.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.479
What are you doing,
are you crazy?

00:37.520 --> 00:39.320
No, it's nothing.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.320
You're nothing.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.159
Buddha, switch sides with me.

00:44.280 --> 00:48.320
I close my eyes and go
to a tiny, pure place in my heart

00:48.359 --> 00:52.399
that was fortunate enough to meet
the pure place in your heart.

00:52.479 --> 00:54.479
I can't stop thinking about you.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.400
Just kidding,
just kidding, just kidding.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.120
Do you like him disturbing her
while she's sleeping?

01:16.200 --> 01:17.400
Do you have a better idea?

01:17.480 --> 01:20.680
Did you put sweetener in mine?
-Yes. -Thanks.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.079
Yes, he should disturb her
while she's masturbating, it's funnier.

01:25.159 --> 01:27.280
Everything with you
is about masturbating

01:27.359 --> 01:30.159
and poo and beards.
-Okay.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.079
We will lose half of the audience.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.560
Okay, fine.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.719
Is it four or five years?

01:41.439 --> 01:42.480
What?

01:43.640 --> 01:46.640
Were we together
for four or five years?

01:47.680 --> 01:51.079
Five.
-Five, right? Yes.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.599
Because I noticed
the milk expired on February 22nd,

01:55.680 --> 01:57.079
which is today, right?

01:57.359 --> 01:59.480
Yes,
today's the 22nd.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.480
Come on, silly, it's the 22nd.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.319
What about the 22nd?

02:04.359 --> 02:07.680
Nothing, I just saw the date
on the milk and remembered

02:07.719 --> 02:10.479
that today is our 5th anniversary.
That's it.

02:12.439 --> 02:14.400
Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

02:14.479 --> 02:15.960
When we were together
we never celebrated it,

02:16.039 --> 02:18.319
but it's a whole different story
after we broke up. -Right.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.080
Let's send flowers.

02:21.639 --> 02:24.240
But why do you date it
from February 22nd?

02:24.280 --> 02:26.159
I kept the receipt.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.719
What receipt?

02:28.120 --> 02:30.120
The drugstore receipt,
where you wrote down your number.

02:30.199 --> 02:32.719
You kept the receipt?
No fuckin' way.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.159
It's in your wallet?

02:38.280 --> 02:39.319
No way.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.400
Ta-da.
-No way.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.680
Suddenly I'm not the Tin Man,
I do have a heart.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.319
I'm very surprised.
-Surprise!

02:51.400 --> 02:54.479
You surprised me. Here, you keep it.
-Thanks.

02:55.039 --> 02:57.479
I don't count from there.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.680
Why not?

03:02.719 --> 03:06.280
It was our first month,
it was a difficult month.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.319
If you don't count
the difficult months,

03:08.400 --> 03:10.479
you'll be left with one week.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.479
Why count that month?

03:14.599 --> 03:17.240
There was no
emotional connection.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.159
Did you have sex with
someone else during that month?

03:23.080 --> 03:25.479
There was...

03:25.599 --> 03:28.680
a little overlapping.
That's all.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.479
Just until I realized
I was totally in love with you.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.639
That's funny.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.439
Who was it?
Never mind,

03:38.479 --> 03:41.159
I don't really care.

03:42.719 --> 03:44.319
I may have sensed it.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.479
Oh, come on,
what did you sense?

03:46.560 --> 03:49.120
I felt that our relationship got off
on the wrong foot.

03:49.199 --> 03:52.240
Oh, please.
-No, excuse me...

03:52.280 --> 03:53.479
Yes?
-It started with a lie.

03:53.599 --> 03:55.319
That's all there is...
-You're way off.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.479
We buttoned-up wrong
from the start

03:57.560 --> 03:59.719
and it all came out wrong.
-Don't give me that button bullshit,

04:00.000 --> 04:01.680
-Why not?
-No! No!

04:01.719 --> 04:04.479
A month after we met
I was totally in love,

04:04.599 --> 04:06.080
I didn't commit adultery or lie,

04:06.159 --> 04:08.400
so don't make up excuses
for not wanting me.

04:08.479 --> 04:09.599
I would've had six kids with you,

04:09.680 --> 04:13.080
so what if I had sex once with Nir Barami...
-I knew it!

04:13.199 --> 04:16.480
I knew it.
-You're a real private eye.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.120
I'd've bet a million bucks that...
-What an insight!

04:19.199 --> 04:23.279
That snake!
-Nir Barami is...

04:39.199 --> 04:41.319
Don't do that again.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.079
Okay?

04:44.720 --> 04:47.160
I'm not there anymore.
-Of course.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.079
Sure, yes.

05:32.079 --> 05:34.079
Oh, here she is.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.160
Good morning.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.240
Should I tell her?
-What?

05:40.319 --> 05:41.680
Yes.
-Asking me to keep a secret

05:41.959 --> 05:44.439
is like asking a whore to keep
her legs closed. -What?

05:44.519 --> 05:47.279
Nothing. -What?
-Nothing. -What?

05:47.319 --> 05:50.000
The next play to be done
at Hamishkan Theatre

05:50.079 --> 05:51.319
is called 'Autumn'

05:51.439 --> 05:53.480
written by someone named
Iris Schtiebel.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.000
Please turn off
your mobile devices...

05:59.519 --> 06:02.319
No way. Really?
-Come here.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.079
Oh my god.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.639
You deserve it, solnishka.

06:07.680 --> 06:12.680
We have a brand new
playwright-in-residence on our hands, huh?

06:12.720 --> 06:13.560
Yes.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.279
When do you want
to start rehearsals?

06:18.360 --> 06:20.279
Wrap up the comedy first

06:20.360 --> 06:21.600
then you'll start rehearsals.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.120
It's serious material,

06:23.240 --> 06:24.399
there's a serious director.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.600
We'll need a lot of time
for rehearsals.

06:27.399 --> 06:31.319
Well, I don't want to disturb you here...

06:37.279 --> 06:38.959
Congratulations, Tzutz.

06:39.199 --> 06:42.480
Isn't this crazy?
-It is.

06:45.959 --> 06:47.120
Thank you.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.959
Listen, I didn't tell you

06:49.040 --> 06:50.439
because I know
you don't like the play...

06:50.480 --> 06:52.000
Sure, sure.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.480
I think we should get started.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.560
Wait a second.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.480
Did want me to suggest you
be the director?

06:59.639 --> 07:01.439
No, of course not.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.680
You're sure, right?

07:02.959 --> 07:07.680
Yes, the wedding was amazing, thanks.

07:07.720 --> 07:11.279
Even though it's expensive,
for our honeymoon I thought...

07:11.360 --> 07:13.560
Ilia, why is my neck mic on?

07:13.639 --> 07:15.279
Sorry, my mistake.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.600
I turned it on by mistake,
sorry.

07:17.680 --> 07:21.680
Okay. Stas, stop your work here.
Come on.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.480
I want to get started.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.680
We're going to start cue to cue.

07:26.959 --> 07:29.160
Ofer, cue-to-cue is when...
-Go on, go on.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.240
It's okay, he knows.

07:31.319 --> 07:33.680
So we really need to focus

07:33.959 --> 07:36.079
be patient,
and no talking.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.480
Regarding all the...
-Excuse me.

07:37.519 --> 07:41.959
Eyal and Ilia have joined us
for sound and lighting,

07:42.040 --> 07:43.480
So please, guys,

07:43.600 --> 07:47.240
Only I do the talking, okay?
Let's start.

07:47.319 --> 07:50.120
-Yes.
-Here. -Thanks.

07:50.199 --> 07:51.720
Tomer.
-Okay.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.639
Okay, let's start.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.439
Here we go.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.720
Actors off the stage.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.680
Do you have boxes
in the preset?

08:00.720 --> 08:02.480
Yes.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.319
Just one sec.
Am I supposed to feel bad?

08:06.439 --> 08:08.079
Because you seem...
-No, not at all.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.560
We're good, right?
-Yes.

08:10.079 --> 08:11.240
Okay, lights...

08:11.279 --> 08:14.399
Let's say the pre-show
announcement is over.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.680
Fade to black.

08:19.079 --> 08:22.279
Actors on stage.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.319
First music cue.

08:27.319 --> 08:30.480
And lights.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.320
Tzutz, look.

08:37.279 --> 08:38.080
What?

08:38.159 --> 08:40.440
Our own apartment,
what do you think?

08:40.600 --> 08:42.320
It's ours.
It's a good apartment.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.240
You think we made a mistake?

08:44.279 --> 08:46.559
Just one sec,
sorry for driving you crazy,

08:46.639 --> 08:49.279
but I'm freaking out,
it looks like you're mad at me.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.320
Stop it. -I don't understand.
-You're disturbing me.

08:52.399 --> 08:56.159
I don't, do you? -I...
-Okay, I'm sorry.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.480
I... Yes.

08:58.679 --> 09:00.000
Guys, hold a sec.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.559
It doesn't cost money
to act well.

09:02.639 --> 09:04.240
Is this a technical rehearsal
or an acting rehearsal?

09:04.279 --> 09:07.240
Maya, you can act well
in a technical rehearsal too.

09:07.279 --> 09:08.480
Thank you.
From the top.

09:08.639 --> 09:10.320
Why from the top, Tomer?

09:10.440 --> 09:12.720
Ofer, I said only I'd be
doing the talking today.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.639
Okay? Thank you.
From the top.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.279
Black.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.159
Black.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.159
Black. Black!
Ilia, what's going on?

09:23.240 --> 09:27.320
Black! -Sorry, sorry, it's me.
-Fine.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.320
Actors on stage.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.080
First music cue.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.399
Excuse me?

09:38.679 --> 09:42.000
I'll just take
a minute of your time...

09:43.000 --> 09:44.320
Just a sec, apologies.

09:44.440 --> 09:48.480
Oh, the couch director,
what was your name again?

09:48.600 --> 09:52.320
Tomer. -Tomer, can I have a minute
of your time? -No problem, Shlomo.

09:52.399 --> 09:54.440
Thank you. Iris,

09:55.679 --> 09:59.080
I don't know if you know, but...

09:59.360 --> 10:02.000
my late mother
had dementia

10:02.200 --> 10:05.480
and to read
such a brave play about old age,

10:05.600 --> 10:09.679
it's like you wrote
that marvellous part just for me.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.240
You can say many things about me,
but I hardly flatter.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.000
I just want to say that...

10:16.080 --> 10:20.080
I can't remember the last time
I was so touched by a play...

10:20.159 --> 10:22.000
it's an incredible play.

10:22.639 --> 10:24.279
Can I give you a hug?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.000
Of course.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.320
Thank you.
-Sorry for interrupting.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.480
Tomer, thanks so much,
Apologies.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.120
-Oh my god.

10:47.399 --> 10:50.120
I've never seen Shlomo like that.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.279
Gave me goosebumps.
-Me too.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.320
That's the play
you were telling me about.

10:57.080 --> 11:01.320
Okay.
Please start the scene.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.000
Stay where you are.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.559
You're already here,

11:05.639 --> 11:07.480
the lights are on,
there's music.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.480
Not now, Ilia!

11:09.519 --> 11:13.080
Lights, please. Thank you.
Start the text, please.

11:13.279 --> 11:15.159
Tzutz, look.
-What?

11:15.279 --> 11:17.159
Our own apartment,
what do you think?

11:17.320 --> 11:18.480
It's ours, yes.

11:18.559 --> 11:20.279
You think
we made a mistake?

11:20.399 --> 11:21.720
With the apartment?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.600
What do you think
about them switching places?

11:24.679 --> 11:26.000
It's a good apartment.

11:26.399 --> 11:28.720
What?
-It's a good apartment.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.320
Nothing.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.159
You want them to switch places?

11:34.559 --> 11:35.679
Yes?

11:35.720 --> 11:37.480
Do you know how to direct this?

11:37.519 --> 11:38.480
Go ahead.

11:38.559 --> 11:40.679
Never mind, I'm sorry.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.679
You don't want to?
-No, I don't.

11:42.960 --> 11:43.679
No?

11:43.720 --> 11:45.480
I just suggested that...

11:45.559 --> 11:48.320
Don't tell me, tell them.

11:49.279 --> 11:52.159
Do it, do it, do it.

11:52.639 --> 11:53.720
Cool.

11:54.200 --> 11:58.960
Ofer, would you mind
switching places with Maya?

11:59.080 --> 12:02.480
It'll make your entrance longer
and will look nicer.

12:02.519 --> 12:05.080
You go all the way...
-No, we're not trying this,

12:05.120 --> 12:07.679
it won't look nicer.
Okay, out, black.

12:07.720 --> 12:11.320
Why?
-Out! From the top! Black, please!

12:11.519 --> 12:12.679
Black!

12:13.080 --> 12:15.000
Ilia, how many times
do I have to ask for black?

12:15.080 --> 12:16.720
He went out for a smoke.
I'll go get him.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.720
Forget it. Come back,
you're already here.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Pick it up.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.159
Start the text.
Lift up the box.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.639
Text.
-Tzutz, look.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.440
What?
-Our own apartment.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.639
Did I do something to you?

12:30.679 --> 12:32.480
Please,
you're interrupting my work.

12:32.559 --> 12:34.159
Your work?
I'm working, too.

12:34.279 --> 12:35.600
Maya, text.
-No, really. -Go ahead.

12:35.679 --> 12:37.960
Tzutz, look.
-What?

12:38.039 --> 12:39.559
Our own apartment.
-Why is it an idiotic idea?

12:39.639 --> 12:42.639
Because I thought of it?
-No, because it's an idiotic idea.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.440
You're worried
about aesthetics now?

12:44.480 --> 12:46.480
Why not?
-Because it's not important

12:46.559 --> 12:48.679
where they're standing.
It doesn't matter.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.559
As long as they stand there
and start the text!

12:51.679 --> 12:53.080
Text, please!
-Yes.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.159
Tzutz, look.
-What?

12:55.279 --> 12:57.600
Our own apartment, what do you think?
-It's ours. It's a good apartment.

12:57.679 --> 13:00.399
But you're in love with him!
What is your problem?

13:00.480 --> 13:03.120
You've just moved in together,
isn't that clear?

13:03.200 --> 13:06.320
You love him,
it's the beginning of your relationship,

13:06.399 --> 13:08.000
before the shit starts,

13:08.080 --> 13:09.480
why is it so hard
to act like you're in love?

13:09.519 --> 13:13.600
What's going on?
-We're back! -Great, thank you.

13:13.679 --> 13:17.159
I can make a comment.
-Not in the middle of a technical rehearsal.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.639
Don't yell at me. -Not in the middle
of a technical rehearsal.

13:19.679 --> 13:20.600
Fine.

13:20.679 --> 13:23.480
Then I'll put all of my comments
in a huge file

13:23.519 --> 13:25.320
and share them with you on Google Drive.
-Great.

13:25.399 --> 13:28.279
But I'll put all the comments
I have for you in general, okay?

13:28.320 --> 13:30.159
Print them out for me, okay?

13:30.279 --> 13:32.600
So I can shove them up my ass!

13:39.039 --> 13:40.279
Okay...

13:42.600 --> 13:44.320
Sorry.

13:45.240 --> 13:48.279
Let's get Groshovsky so he can
show you how to direct this play.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.440
Get out.
-You wish.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.480
I'm asking you to get out.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.480
In your dreams.
-I'm asking you to get out.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.399
Stop... Stop talking.
Don't touch...

13:54.480 --> 13:56.120
Do not touch me!

13:56.200 --> 13:57.960
Please turn off
your mobile devices...

13:58.039 --> 13:59.720
What's going on?
-My mistake.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.240
Be grateful I wrote you a play
that's easy to direct.

14:02.279 --> 14:04.639
Make her stop talking.
-You should be able to handle it.

14:04.679 --> 14:06.639
-Is it too hard for you?
-I can't stand hearing her.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.960
What?
-I can't stand her voice.

14:08.039 --> 14:09.279
I hate her, I can't...
-Oh yeah?

14:09.320 --> 14:10.399
Then why did you kiss me?
-What?

14:10.480 --> 14:12.080
Why did you kiss me?
-Mistake! Big mistake!

14:12.120 --> 14:14.080
Then don't make mistakes.
Don't make mistakes!

14:14.360 --> 14:17.159
Mistake... It was a mistake
I ever met you. -Oh yeah?

14:17.240 --> 14:20.120
Sweetie, calm down.
-You stay the hell away from me.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.000
I've had enough of you.

14:23.039 --> 14:24.320
Mistake...

14:26.679 --> 14:29.080
She's leaving.
Go after her.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.559
Go, go after her.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.440
My love,

14:42.960 --> 14:45.639
you're an important actor,
you know that, don't you?

14:46.279 --> 14:49.000
The theater is dead without
actors like you.

14:49.639 --> 14:53.240
I've had a rough week.
-Yes, I know.

14:53.279 --> 14:55.080
There was one performance

14:55.159 --> 14:58.000
with an understudy

14:58.080 --> 15:00.279
and it confused me, that's all.

15:00.320 --> 15:01.320
Ezra...

15:01.360 --> 15:04.480
There's no problem, I'm..
I'm fine.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.080
I swim every morning,

15:07.159 --> 15:11.159
I still do pantomime, you know.

15:11.279 --> 15:14.440
Yes. I'd like to suggest...
-Yes?

15:14.480 --> 15:17.279
That you take some time off.
-Time off?

15:17.320 --> 15:20.159
Then we'll see how you feel.
-What time off?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.679
What do you mean,
I seem confused?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.120
Who's talking about me?
-It doesn't matter, Ezrachka.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.279
Who, stagehands? Actors?

15:28.320 --> 15:29.559
Itzik?

15:29.639 --> 15:31.080
The audience.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.320
Ezra, the audience can notice it.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.399
Vera, I can't work like this.
I'm telling you.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.559
I cannot work like this!

15:41.639 --> 15:43.080
How dare you barge in here!

15:43.159 --> 15:44.720
Can't you see
there's someone sitting here?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.480
Okay, sorry,
but I'm telling you,

15:46.559 --> 15:50.080
I'm not going back there
if she's there!

15:50.159 --> 15:51.679
Forgive me, Ezra.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.279
That's it.
I can't direct a play like this.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.000
What happened?
-Nothing happened.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.120
But it's either me or Iris.
Period.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.480
Tomer, don't say things at night
that you'll regret in the morning.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.440
I'm saying it like it is,
I can't work like this.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.480
That's it. I can't,

16:05.559 --> 16:07.480
I can't work like this!

16:11.279 --> 16:14.559
What do you mean, time off?

16:37.039 --> 16:38.480
Nice. An unexpected move.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.559
Eyal, Ilia,
let's rehearse on our own.

16:43.399 --> 16:46.000
Come on, Eyal,
the play opens next week.

16:46.080 --> 16:49.080
It's the season finale.
-What are you watching?

16:49.360 --> 16:51.480
'Love Under Fire'.
-Are you kidding?

16:51.559 --> 16:53.279
Let's go,
I'll tell you how it ends.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.480
No, no, no.

16:54.519 --> 16:57.159
Don't tell me,
it's almost over.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.120
I feel like time
is working against me,

16:59.200 --> 17:01.279
it hurts more and more.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.240
They always say that
the death of heroes is a worthy death,

17:04.279 --> 17:05.599
and I ask, worthy of what?

17:05.680 --> 17:08.680
After all, you were a hero
when you were alive, too.

17:09.039 --> 17:10.119
What is this scene?

17:10.200 --> 17:13.400
My darling Ron,
I promise I'll never forget you.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.160
Your smile, your funny walk,

17:16.279 --> 17:18.319
how you loved hot cocoa
in the winter...

17:18.359 --> 17:22.400
He's dead.
-Wow, what a twist.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.279
They killed me?

17:26.440 --> 17:32.279
Unpredictable, totally unpredictable.
-Look at this.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.480
I love you, my Ron,
I don't know how I'll go on.

17:37.519 --> 17:40.480
The day before Ron died,
I asked him,

17:42.680 --> 17:45.480
"Do you promise
to watch out for yourself?"

17:46.119 --> 17:48.319
And he replied as he always did...

17:48.480 --> 17:49.680
You didn't know?

17:49.720 --> 17:52.000
"I swear, pinky promise..."

17:52.079 --> 17:55.000
What did you think
they'd do, Ofer? It was obvious.

17:55.079 --> 17:58.319
The Hezbollah could've
abducted me or something,

17:58.400 --> 18:01.279
to keep the door open
for another season.

18:09.039 --> 18:12.559
Come on, let's go upstairs
and go over the cues.

18:13.079 --> 18:16.960
That's it, it's the end,
nothing happens afterwards.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.400
Come upstairs.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.480
They didn't tell you?

18:37.319 --> 18:38.680
Assholes.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.279
What a fucked-up profession.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.000
You know...

18:51.119 --> 18:52.720
As time goes by,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.720
the less I understand
this profession.

18:56.319 --> 18:58.559
But don't worry,
you'll do many more shows

18:58.640 --> 19:01.680
and so many more plays,
it'll make you sick.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.640
Wait, is it because of the...

19:06.680 --> 19:09.480
pictures you sent
to someone there?

19:11.319 --> 19:13.119
Who did you send them to?

19:14.599 --> 19:17.000
The producer's wife.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.319
You sent a picture to the wife of--

19:19.400 --> 19:21.119
The producer of the show?

19:21.200 --> 19:24.680
We had... a thing.

19:26.319 --> 19:28.319
This is so fucked up.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.000
This is not the first time that you...

19:31.079 --> 19:32.720
Okay, I know.
-It doesn't...

19:33.000 --> 19:34.319
make any sense.

19:34.359 --> 19:37.640
What do you want from me, Shlomo?
-No, because you're an intelligent guy.

19:37.680 --> 19:41.000
Okay, just give me a break.

19:42.519 --> 19:43.680
Maybe...

19:43.960 --> 19:45.319
you're addicted.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
What?

19:47.480 --> 19:49.480
I think you may be
addicted to sex.

19:49.559 --> 19:51.440
And I think you're addicted to...

19:51.480 --> 19:54.480
being crazy.
-No, you idiot.

19:54.680 --> 19:58.319
I think you have a problem:
you're addicted to sex and need help.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.960
What's 'addicted to sex'?
-Addicted,

20:00.039 --> 20:01.720
you can't stop
even when you want to stop!

20:02.000 --> 20:03.440
For God's sake,
how many times

20:03.480 --> 20:08.160
can you insist on sending
a dick pic to the wrong woman?

20:11.559 --> 20:14.079
You're shocked
they kicked you off the show?

20:14.119 --> 20:17.160
Why would the producer want you back
if you had sex with his wife?

20:17.240 --> 20:19.240
Would you want you back?

20:21.079 --> 20:23.160
No.
-Of course not!

20:27.200 --> 20:29.480
Fine, just breathe.

20:30.359 --> 20:34.160
Hold on, let me think...

20:35.160 --> 20:37.240
Unbelievable.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.480
It's unbelievable.

20:42.680 --> 20:46.400
Sorry. -Leave me alone.
-No, I'm sorry, it's...

20:47.279 --> 20:48.720
Poor guy.

21:36.960 --> 21:40.079
Tzutz, look,
our own apartment.

21:46.039 --> 21:50.000
I was thinking of putting
the couch against the wall.

21:50.079 --> 21:53.680
Yeah, I was thinking of putting
the couch over the wall.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.680
I was thinking of putting
the couch over the wall...

21:56.960 --> 21:59.160
Against the wall,
you idiot.

21:59.279 --> 22:01.480
But we can't because
the colors are too cold

22:01.519 --> 22:05.079
so I was thinking of putting it
against that wall...

22:17.200 --> 22:19.079
Why would you
say something like that

22:19.119 --> 22:21.119
in the middle of my wedding?

22:23.319 --> 22:24.680
What?

22:27.319 --> 22:29.680
Really, where in Tel Aviv?

23:27.359 --> 23:31.000
Listen, I think
you need to talk to Vera

23:31.079 --> 23:32.279
and try to get your shit together

23:32.319 --> 23:35.240
because getting up and leaving
was way out of line.

23:39.079 --> 23:40.680
I think you're wrong.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.480
I'm just trying to help you.

23:43.559 --> 23:46.480
Fine, I guess I can't help you.

23:46.519 --> 23:48.640
Bye.

23:50.319 --> 23:52.480
How you loved hot cocoa
in the winter...

23:52.559 --> 23:56.160
I don't believe it.
-What happened?

23:56.279 --> 23:59.000
He's dead. He's dead.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.000
Yeah, I guess.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.119
Why is he dead?

24:04.359 --> 24:06.279
He was good.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.480
Why is he dead?
-Oh, sweetie.

24:09.559 --> 24:13.119
It's not fair, I should've
never watched this stupid show.

24:13.240 --> 24:17.160
Oh, sweet girl.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.559
Listen, this guy is so alive,
you have no idea.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.319
There's really no reason to cry.

24:23.400 --> 24:28.480
I know that Ofer Marciano
the actor isn't dead, but...

24:29.319 --> 24:31.640
he's dead.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.680
Ron.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.480
Okay, but you know...
Sweetie,

24:37.519 --> 24:40.559
that's what's nice
about TV characters,

24:40.640 --> 24:44.319
you can watch the previous episode
and he'll be alive again.

24:44.440 --> 24:48.279
But I know he'll die in the end
and it ruins everything.

24:48.559 --> 24:50.160
So what if you know
he dies in the end,

24:50.240 --> 24:51.480
we all know
we'll die in the end,

24:51.599 --> 24:53.720
does it ruin everything for us?

24:54.599 --> 24:59.240
Yes, it ruins everything.

25:04.279 --> 25:06.480
Just a sec.

25:17.039 --> 25:18.480
You're alive.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.480
Something like that.

25:22.680 --> 25:26.960
I want you to meet Sara,
my neighbor.

25:27.240 --> 25:31.279
Hi, nice to meet you,
I'm Ofer.

25:31.319 --> 25:34.000
She loves 'Love Under Fire'.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.720
Nice.

25:36.119 --> 25:40.599
Want to take a picture with me, Sara?
Great.

25:41.680 --> 25:45.480
You're so sweet.
Is that your phone?

25:45.599 --> 25:49.559
Why are you so sad?
Be happy. Come on.

25:50.559 --> 25:53.000
Smile.

25:53.079 --> 25:56.480
There you go.
You're so sweet.

25:56.599 --> 26:00.319
Maybe Sara can go home now?

26:00.400 --> 26:04.160
I need a few minutes with Iris.

26:04.279 --> 26:06.079
Too bad you're dead.

26:06.279 --> 26:07.960
You don't have to.
-It's okay.

26:08.039 --> 26:09.319
Sara...

26:19.680 --> 26:23.160
Ofer, no...
-Wait! -Do me a favor.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.240
Feel my heart.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.640
It never beat like this before.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.319
Okay.
-I have a problem, Iris, I know it.

26:33.400 --> 26:36.319
What I did at the wedding
was a leftover of the past.

26:36.359 --> 26:40.319
I really do want something else.
-What do you want? -Everything.

26:41.079 --> 26:44.720
Everything including everything.
-Really? -Everything.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.279
Give me your phone for a sec.
-What for?

26:48.319 --> 26:50.319
Just give it to me.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.680
Here, whatever you want.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.720
Let's look at something together, okay?
-Sure.

26:56.680 --> 27:00.000
Okay.
Here we go.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.279
Irit flight attendant.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.279
"Are you in the country?"

27:05.640 --> 27:06.680
Einav from Holon.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.480
"I miss your ass,
can you send me a reminder?"

27:10.519 --> 27:11.480
What else?

27:11.519 --> 27:14.440
Michal, Yarden,

27:14.480 --> 27:15.319
Dana from the gym.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.680
No, Dana is...

27:16.960 --> 27:18.440
I have to renew my membership.
-Okay.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.640
Ofer, you're missing the point.
Here,

27:20.680 --> 27:22.720
Neta, Karina's friend.

27:23.039 --> 27:23.680
"I'm cumming."

27:23.720 --> 27:26.960
It's... She's coming.
She's actually doing it.

27:27.039 --> 27:29.079
But I'm the first to say that
I'm fucked-up.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.279
These are texts from this week.

27:31.319 --> 27:33.319
Just from this week.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.000
I don't know what's wrong with you,

27:35.079 --> 27:36.319
but I'm not the solution.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.119
Help me.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.079
Help me.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.559
If you say no, I'll die.

27:41.640 --> 27:43.279
You won't die.
-I'll die!

27:43.319 --> 27:44.559
You won't die.
-I'm dead!

27:44.640 --> 27:46.480
No, you won't.
-Give me that.

27:46.559 --> 27:47.960
What?
-I'm burning this phone.

27:48.039 --> 27:49.720
No, you're not.
-How do I turn the gas on?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.680
You're being ridiculous.
-How do I turn the gas on?

27:51.720 --> 27:53.640
Leave the gas alone, Ofer.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.279
I'm burning this phone
with all the girls inside.

27:56.319 --> 27:57.480
I don't need them.
Turn the gas on.

27:57.519 --> 27:59.559
This is not cute.

27:59.640 --> 28:02.160
No! Ofer! Stop it!
-Wait, wait.

28:02.279 --> 28:04.480
Are you nuts?
Stop it!

28:04.599 --> 28:05.720
It's okay.
-What are you doing?

28:06.000 --> 28:09.079
Here, call BuzzFeed,
call E! Entertainment,

28:09.119 --> 28:11.640
tell them
I sent you a dick pic.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.079
What? -That I'm messing
with women from the theater.

28:14.119 --> 28:15.640
Go on, ruin my career.
-Why?

28:15.680 --> 28:17.160
Because I don't care!

28:17.279 --> 28:18.599
I don't give a shit!

28:18.680 --> 28:21.279
I've never loved anyone
like this before!

28:21.319 --> 28:24.160
When did you have
the time to fall in love like this?

28:24.240 --> 28:27.000
Why so over-the-top?
-Because it is over-the-top!

28:27.079 --> 28:28.680
And that's how I feel!

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
What am I supposed to do?

28:51.359 --> 28:52.720
Don't cry.

28:55.279 --> 28:57.480
It's okay, sweetie.

28:58.319 --> 29:01.000
I'm sorry, Iris.
-It's okay.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.319
Come here.

29:06.279 --> 29:08.079
What is this?

29:08.119 --> 29:10.599
Are you nuts, what is this?

29:12.720 --> 29:16.240
How did you just
show up in my life?

29:19.400 --> 29:21.000
Okay.

29:24.279 --> 29:26.119
All right.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.079
Okay, all right.

29:39.559 --> 29:41.119
Ofer...

29:48.079 --> 29:50.440
Ofer... Tomer...
No, no, no,

29:50.480 --> 29:53.559
No! What is this?
What is your problem?

29:53.640 --> 29:56.279
What are you, the devil?
A sorcerer?

29:56.319 --> 29:58.680
No, don't come near me!

29:58.720 --> 30:00.079
Don't cross the line
of the couch.

30:00.119 --> 30:02.279
Don't cross the line
of the middle of the couch.

30:02.319 --> 30:04.480
Okay, you listen to me.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.680
I have my own problems, okay?

30:06.960 --> 30:09.079
We'll each deal
with our own problems, okay?

30:09.119 --> 30:10.279
Now please leave.

30:10.319 --> 30:12.640
Ofer, Ofer.

30:15.039 --> 30:17.000
Can I just...

30:17.119 --> 30:19.480
make you cum
one last time?

30:19.680 --> 30:20.680
No.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.119
Then I'll cum.

30:24.279 --> 30:25.240
No.

30:25.599 --> 30:27.319
Just cum.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.160
I'm not interested.

30:29.279 --> 30:30.599
Then let's take a shower.

30:30.680 --> 30:31.960
No touching.

30:32.079 --> 30:33.680
No.
-Then just let me wash you.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.079
I took a shower this morning,
thanks.

31:15.079 --> 31:17.079
Good morning.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.079
Hello.

31:20.279 --> 31:24.400
Good morning.

31:24.559 --> 31:27.640
Let's make this short and sweet.

31:27.680 --> 31:31.640
I assume you all know each other,
so no need for introductions.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.079
Dovaleh agreed to come
and save us,

31:34.119 --> 31:35.400
so he'll be our director...

31:35.480 --> 31:36.640
For the next six days.

31:36.680 --> 31:41.240
Be good and
no hassling him, okay?

31:42.079 --> 31:43.319
I can't hear you.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.279
Okay or not okay?
Great.

31:46.079 --> 31:48.599
Good luck.
Dovaleh, good luck. -Thank you.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.319
Make yourself at home.

31:52.359 --> 31:53.559
All right.

31:57.119 --> 31:58.160
Let's see what

31:58.200 --> 31:59.480
you've done so far.
