WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.133
Besides the personal
stuff going on at home,

00:03.133 --> 00:05.353
there'’s also been stuff going
on within the interior.

00:05.353 --> 00:07.268
You'’ve been a fake-ass bitch

00:07.268 --> 00:08.443
talking sh-- behind my
back since day one.

00:08.443 --> 00:11.359
Focus on your own
- ed up life.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.925
I feel the need to get off now.

00:12.925 --> 00:15.450
I will never find anyone
who'’s as excellent as you.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.364
Goodbye, boat.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.279
Your screaming match with Max

00:18.279 --> 00:20.324
and your screaming match
with Natalya.

00:20.324 --> 00:23.719
If I have one crew member come
to me about you, you'’re off.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.031
I just want a cuddle, bro.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.729
Here'’s your new stewardess.

00:33.729 --> 00:34.991
So she'’s green.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.253
Hello, welcome aboard.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.038
Hi, I'’m Lily.
Nice to meet you.

00:40.214 --> 00:42.085
This is the laundry room.
It'’s really big.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.047
I just want to make sure
my underwear

00:47.047 --> 00:49.005
and my socks make it
back to my cabin.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.441
Oh, my God.

00:50.441 --> 00:53.531
I was like, [bleep], [bleep],
, [bleep].

01:16.467 --> 01:20.254
Your banter is above us,
so have your banter.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.777
Wait, what happened?

01:21.777 --> 01:24.388
He wasn'’t so brave
without you, but now he is.

01:24.388 --> 01:28.827
Lily'’s already being influenced
by Jack of who I am.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.786
And now you'’ve opened
a book of worms.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.144
Our banter is so sh--.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.103
Hey, Lily, is it or not?

01:44.147 --> 01:45.540
They'’re playing games.

01:45.540 --> 01:46.889
I don'’t know what
she'’s talking about,

01:46.889 --> 01:48.064
'’cause I'll see something else.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.500
We give good
banter in England.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.199
I mean, you New Zealand,
we have banter, we have banter.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.722
We'’re from different places.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.250
I see Kyle and I see drama.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.130
Let me go take a wee wee.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.570
God damn it.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.572
Kyle'’s definitely
a stick of dynamite.

02:17.572 --> 02:19.095
He doesn'’t need the match.

02:19.095 --> 02:20.792
He just... pew.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.054
Come on, guys.

02:22.054 --> 02:23.578
Can we just behave?

02:25.928 --> 02:27.973
Bro, let'’s dance, bro.
I want to dance, bro.

02:27.973 --> 02:30.715
- Go, go, go!
- Go, Maxy!

02:35.720 --> 02:37.635
Let'’s go, let's go,
let'’s go, let's go!

02:40.377 --> 02:42.292
- The bill.
- Done.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.294
Let'’s go!

02:44.294 --> 02:46.166
- Let'’s go, baby.
- Race, 1-2-3.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.473
She won.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.127
Is it me and the birds
in the taxi?

02:51.127 --> 02:52.128
Yeah.

02:52.128 --> 02:53.303
Guys, I need gum.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.218
You need cum?

02:55.218 --> 02:56.915
- Cum?
- Cum?

03:03.922 --> 03:05.228
Oh, my God.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.708
That'’s disgusting.

03:08.013 --> 03:09.232
It'’s like babysitting.

03:11.843 --> 03:14.803
When I walk downstairs, I don'’t
want to see this disaster.

03:14.803 --> 03:17.675
The crew mess,
that'’ll be deck's department.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.155
Keep the crew mess tidy.

03:19.155 --> 03:20.635
Even in between charters.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.507
After your party, you
clean up after yourself.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.117
It'’s not a frat house.

03:25.117 --> 03:27.337
Oh, God. Oh, God.

03:27.337 --> 03:30.340
Oh, my God, I'’m so excited.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.168
Literally adorable.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.126
Oh, my God!

03:34.126 --> 03:35.127
Welcome to Bisu.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.477
It'’s a Bisu!

03:41.221 --> 03:43.397
- Here we go.
- Cheers, guys.

03:44.659 --> 03:45.877
Okay.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.924
All right, okay,
all right, okay, all right.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.503
Okay.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.422
Damn right.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.862
Yeah.

04:13.862 --> 04:17.257
Luka is cute, and you'’re stupid
if you don'’t think so.

05:07.785 --> 05:10.353
He made me feel like
if you'’re not on his side,

05:10.353 --> 05:11.702
then he might as well just
be in the sea.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.791
That'’s what it kind
of feels like.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.972
- Ah!
- No, no, no, no!

05:23.061 --> 05:24.367
Here we go!

05:57.357 --> 05:59.315
I feel like a preschool teacher

05:59.315 --> 06:00.969
trying to get the kids together.

06:00.969 --> 06:04.320
I thought the dramatic days
of the boat are behind me.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.582
Natalya is gone.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.105
I don'’t have the time
to babysit.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.067
Let me finish.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.285
Stop putting your hand
in my face!

06:13.285 --> 06:14.461
Let me finish.

06:14.461 --> 06:17.594
Focus on your own
- ed up life.

06:21.859 --> 06:24.340
So, Kyle and I need to
have a conversation

06:24.340 --> 06:26.386
without alcohol as well.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.652
- Are we going?
- That'’s what I heard.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.088
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.655
Let'’s go, let's go, let'’s go. Bye.

06:34.655 --> 06:37.397
White van, white van,
bye, baby, white van.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.491
Guys, how was Lily?

06:44.491 --> 06:46.754
I ain'’t saying sh--.

06:49.583 --> 06:53.021
I think Lily is very
influenced by Jack.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.588
He'’s opinion about...

06:54.588 --> 06:55.632
I don'’t think so.
I think Lily is...

06:55.632 --> 06:57.112
I don'’t care what you say.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.027
No, I do care what you say,
you know what I mean?

06:59.027 --> 07:01.682
It'’s good we have you
on board, you know, like...

07:01.682 --> 07:04.424
It'’s giving me some spice,
you know?

07:17.741 --> 07:20.483
Oh, oui-oui.
Oh, oui-oui.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.050
Oui-oui.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.011
Okay, let'’s go, guys.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.535
Wait, wait, but hold on.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.232
Why are you going that way?

07:30.232 --> 07:32.060
Baby, baby, baby.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.763
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.601
Ow! [bleep].

07:56.388 --> 07:58.390
Yeah.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.957
Mmm.

08:15.451 --> 08:16.670
Oh, wait.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.631
- No, no.
- Ah!

08:25.330 --> 08:26.331
Coming up...

08:26.331 --> 08:27.898
Lily, are you okay?

08:27.898 --> 08:32.294
I have a fourth stew that
cannot handle her hangover.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.122
Got it.

08:34.122 --> 08:35.210
It'’s your captain.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.069
Oh my God.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.461
What'’s happening?

09:09.461 --> 09:11.072
I'’m dying.

09:18.645 --> 09:19.689
Did you bang her?

09:19.689 --> 09:22.562
- Did you?
- Yeah.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.130
I like Lily,
I really like Lily.

09:26.130 --> 09:30.134
She'’s pretty, with her
beautiful emerald eyes.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.658
I feel like it'’s Christmas,
you know.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.586
- Yeah.
- What'’s up?

09:47.499 --> 09:48.457
Yeah.

09:48.457 --> 09:49.458
You wanna go to the sundeck?

09:49.458 --> 09:51.155
- Okay.
- Cool.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.983
- How'’s it going on?
- It'’s so----ing hot.

09:52.983 --> 09:53.897
How are you?

09:53.897 --> 09:55.595
Yeah, I'’m good.
But tired.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.641
Oh, it'’s hot.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.295
You see Kyle having a
go at me, didn'’t you?

10:00.295 --> 10:01.818
Explain to me what happened.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.646
He said I'’ve got it in
for the interior team.

10:03.646 --> 10:04.691
I'’m trying to turn
everyone against it.

10:04.691 --> 10:05.996
- Do you think that?
- No.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.215
- Thank you.
- You are part of my team.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.825
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.829
Yeah.

10:17.399 --> 10:19.662
Oh, my God.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.142
Kyle is a little bit paranoid

10:21.142 --> 10:22.970
about people always
coming to get him.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.972
For you to, like, literally
throw me under the bus

10:24.972 --> 10:26.495
like that,
that'’s really hurtful.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.105
I'’m not friends with anybody.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.672
I don'’t trust a single
- ing soul on this boat.

10:29.672 --> 10:30.978
She will throw you
under the----ing bus.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.022
- Not me. Not me.
- I'’ve never done that.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.807
- She will do it to you.
- Not me.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.766
But my job right now is just
to keep Kyle under control

10:36.766 --> 10:38.159
because I cannot have Kyle quit.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.901
As much as Jess can
totally do service,

10:40.901 --> 10:45.122
Lily is horrible at laundry,
so I need him.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.913
Thank you, Cheffy.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.006
I literally feel like I'’m dying.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.051
Start to make your
body in movement.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.705
Oh, my God.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.881
- How'’s it going?
- Brother?

11:04.881 --> 11:07.362
- Sleep well?
- No.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.406
Have you done the schedule?

11:08.406 --> 11:09.756
No, not yet.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.235
I'’ll do anchor watch
if no one wants it.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.149
Okay.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.411
Did you start at eight or six?

11:13.411 --> 11:15.022
Eight till twelve.

11:15.022 --> 11:15.979
Okay.

11:15.979 --> 11:17.589
I'’m usually an engineer, so...

11:17.589 --> 11:20.157
In the past, I'’ve never had
to do any kind of paperwork,

11:20.157 --> 11:21.898
but I do cater
the watch schedule

11:21.898 --> 11:23.683
more towards Max and Haliegh.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.468
I can always rely on Lara to not
give me sh-- if she breaks late.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.905
And that'’s definitely why
she got Lead Deckhand position

11:28.905 --> 11:30.864
because she'’s happy
to just push through.

11:30.864 --> 11:33.736
Luka, Luka.
Can you come to the bridge?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.390
<i>Copy, on my way.</i>

11:36.913 --> 11:38.306
Lily, are you okay?

11:40.134 --> 11:41.744
- Good morning.
- Not so good for you.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.050
Why, what'’s up?

11:43.050 --> 11:45.095
The way the crew mess was left?
Not okay.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.097
There was booze,
there was food.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.969
The garbage was
actually overflowing.

11:48.969 --> 11:51.580
There were plates stacked up
that didn'’t get washed.

11:51.580 --> 11:54.017
Even though this is Luka'’s
first time of being a boson,

11:54.017 --> 11:56.454
it'’s not his first,
second, or third charter.

11:56.454 --> 11:57.717
He knows my expectation.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.501
Being a bosun on a
charter yacht

11:59.501 --> 12:02.547
isn'’t just about throwing lines
and calling distances.

12:02.547 --> 12:05.289
It'’s about making sure that
your schedule is working well.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.857
Is the crew mess clean?
Are the guests taken care of?

12:07.857 --> 12:09.946
Although Luka'’s
doing a fantastic job,

12:09.946 --> 12:11.905
I just don'’t want him
to get complacent

12:11.905 --> 12:13.471
and take his eye off the ball.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.734
It was so bad.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.213
- Go kick some ass.
- Oh, yeah.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.215
- I know what you mean.
- Yeah, okay, cool. Thanks.

12:35.493 --> 12:38.235
How are you doing? Why do you
have a smile on your face?

12:38.235 --> 12:40.150
Was it good last night?

12:41.673 --> 12:43.371
It'’s a very scary place knowing

12:43.371 --> 12:47.027
that my feelings for
Luka is starting to grow

12:47.027 --> 12:50.639
because Scorpio men are known
to be very promiscuous.

12:50.639 --> 12:54.686
Luka stung me and now
I'’m frickin' poisoned.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.778
Where'’s Lily?

13:01.215 --> 13:02.520
Like a lot.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.089
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, it'’s bad.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.180
Lily?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.140
How are you feeling?

13:13.140 --> 13:14.097
Oh my God.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.447
Okay.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.146
Yeah, okay.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.539
We'’re going to clean the buoys
on the swim platform.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.280
Take an hour.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.194
Do you need water?

13:24.194 --> 13:25.369
I can'’t handle it right now.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.370
- Okay.
- Sorry.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.458
No, that'’s fine.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.373
They'’re nautibuoys.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.897
It won'’t take long.

13:32.333 --> 13:36.206
Good morning, Kyley, baby.
I brought hangers.

13:37.381 --> 13:38.556
Nice.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.123
Tumi I'’m also going to...

13:40.123 --> 13:41.255
I just feel a bit ill.
I'’m also going to go lie down.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.734
That'’s not going to happen.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.258
Don'’t----ing spray me, brother.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.349
I want a burger.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.611
So...

13:49.611 --> 13:51.439
Hey, Kylie.

13:56.531 --> 13:59.186
Okay, let me sit down.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.274
Your new friend.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.756
They feel like
you'’re overstepping.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.062
You'’re not getting
along with Chef?

14:06.062 --> 14:07.629
No, I'’ve always gotten
along with him.

14:07.629 --> 14:08.935
So then what happened yesterday?

14:08.935 --> 14:10.371
Because clearly it'’s triggering

14:10.371 --> 14:12.025
and it'’s filtering
into this new girl.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.201
I haven'’t told her
anything about anyone.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.898
Let'’s just stipulate that.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.073
I spoke to Chef at the
table yesterday by himself.

14:17.073 --> 14:17.944
Yeah.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.249
And then she came up to me.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.468
She'’s like, I just
want you to know

14:20.468 --> 14:21.861
I have no problems with you.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.171
So if Chef wants to cause
atomic bombs...

14:28.171 --> 14:31.087
Moving forward, I would rather
just communicate with her.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.915
Let me just tell her what to do.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.090
100%.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.570
We'’re here to work.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.659
Like, I will be asking,
is supper ready, dinner ready?

14:37.659 --> 14:42.359
But as far as him on my
social media is even blocked,

14:42.359 --> 14:44.361
- I couldn'’t care.
- Yeah.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.102
Honestly, at this point,
I don'’t know what

14:46.102 --> 14:47.669
it'’s going to take for Kyle
to just keep quiet.

14:47.669 --> 14:48.975
I just think it'’s who he is.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.281
I don'’t know how to handle that.

14:51.281 --> 14:55.546
Like, I really can'’t be
handling men in their 30s.

14:55.546 --> 14:56.983
I'’m sorry.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.941
- No one must come irritate me.
- I get it.

14:58.941 --> 14:59.986
That'’s bullsh--.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.465
Okay, well, I appreciate you.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.640
Of course, friend.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.251
<i>Jack, Tumi, Luka.</i>

15:04.251 --> 15:06.818
Meet me in the crew mess for
a preference sheet meeting.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.560
<i>Copy.</i>

15:09.560 --> 15:10.692
- Hello.
- Hello.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.128
It'’s charter number six.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.783
Michael Stevens, the CEO of
a dental implant company

15:14.783 --> 15:16.132
in California.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.874
Michael will be joined
by his wife, Connie,

15:18.874 --> 15:19.962
couple Cliff and Carmen,

15:19.962 --> 15:22.051
Simon, his friend, Amish,

15:22.051 --> 15:24.967
and Denver based Greg and
his fiancé, Jennifer.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.317
Guests would like to enjoy
snorkeling and diving

15:27.317 --> 15:31.147
at the Christ of the Abyss
underwater monument.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.888
Haleigh'’s going to be
joining them because

15:32.888 --> 15:33.933
she has a lot of
dive experience.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.586
Okay.

15:35.586 --> 15:39.721
Dinner on the first night should
have a 007 Casino Royale theme.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.245
Primary requests to have
an opera singer come aboard

15:42.245 --> 15:43.290
to sing "Happy Birthday."

15:43.290 --> 15:44.987
Late night snacks are welcome.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.597
Okay, full steam ahead.

15:46.597 --> 15:47.685
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

15:47.685 --> 15:50.558
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

15:50.558 --> 15:51.602
This is clean.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.169
What is, is this clean?

15:53.169 --> 15:55.998
The ironing we'’ll get to,
let'’s just----ing fold

15:55.998 --> 15:58.479
because this laundry looks
like a sh---show.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.742
She'’s just sleeping
at this point.

16:00.742 --> 16:01.873
She needs to get the [bleep] up.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.484
She can'’t be sleeping all day.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.399
Honestly, take charge because
anything I say is taken like

16:05.399 --> 16:08.445
to the next----ing level so
I'’m not saying anything anymore.

16:10.795 --> 16:13.973
Hello, I just want to check
on you. Are you okay?

16:13.973 --> 16:16.236
You want something, water?

16:16.236 --> 16:18.325
Thank you.

16:18.325 --> 16:23.765
Wait, I have a fourth stew that
cannot handle her hangover.

16:23.765 --> 16:25.114
I'’m gonna go wake her up.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.376
What cabin is she in?

16:26.376 --> 16:27.247
Port forward.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.726
- Gotta get up.
- I agree.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.337
Thank you.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.962
It'’s Sandy.
I need you on deck.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.618
It'’s your captain.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.715
It'’s your captain.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.499
I need you on deck.

17:02.499 --> 17:06.025
I heard you'’re
hungover, vomiting.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.244
Are you okay?

17:08.244 --> 17:12.422
Okay, so this is a real job.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.033
Okay, all right.

17:15.773 --> 17:16.731
Yes.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.214
If this happens again
with Lily,

17:21.214 --> 17:22.693
I'’ll have a serious
conversation with her.

17:22.693 --> 17:25.696
Next time you go out,
maybe not drink as much.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.267
Ciao.

17:31.267 --> 17:35.228
Hi. I am having a 007 party,

17:35.228 --> 17:38.318
and I would
like some good entertainment.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.409
Sorry, please repeat that.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.500
What the
is a mentalist?

17:46.500 --> 17:47.892
A mentalist?

17:47.892 --> 17:49.111
It has nothing to do
with the theme,

17:49.111 --> 17:50.765
but there'’s not many options.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.767
It'’s totally
a made-up profession.

17:52.767 --> 17:53.985
I mean, it'’s like a bougie
way of just saying

17:53.985 --> 17:55.465
that you'’re a psychic.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.424
<i>Hey, what time would you
like to have him?</i>

17:57.424 --> 17:58.599
Let'’s say 7:30.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.775
<i>- Perfect.</i>
- Thank you so much.

18:00.775 --> 18:02.951
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>
- Bye.

18:02.951 --> 18:05.997
Okay.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.651
Oh my God.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.440
Hi, I'’m now up
to doing some work.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.746
Can you check all the day
heads and clean them all?

18:15.746 --> 18:16.965
- Yeah.
- The toilets.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.923
And can you clean
our toilet, too?

18:18.923 --> 18:20.403
Yeah.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.072
Oh, my God.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.639
I think I drank a bit too much.

18:38.639 --> 18:42.599
- Hey!
- Hey!

18:42.599 --> 18:44.340
me.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.308
How are you feeling?

18:55.308 --> 18:57.571
- Just a little bit bad, but...
- Really sick?

18:57.571 --> 18:58.746
Really bad.

18:58.746 --> 19:00.400
Are you still throwing up now?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.010
Not since
15 minutes ago.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.098
Really?

19:03.098 --> 19:04.491
ing hell.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.275
But I get it.
I'’ve been there.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.059
But I will get all of this done.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.498
It'’s a lot of
work to manage Lily.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.152
She'’s not retaining information.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.936
I know she can do it.

19:14.936 --> 19:17.591
I'’m just trying to find the how.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.419
So I would focus on
the uniform now.

19:19.419 --> 19:22.509
Just get it done as quickly
as you can and send that back.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.815
You'’ve got a lot
of laundry going on there.

19:30.734 --> 19:31.909
Tumi!

19:31.909 --> 19:33.259
Tell me about the guests.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.825
They'’re all dentists.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.481
By the way, are you
going to sing for us?

19:38.481 --> 19:40.222
I think my voice is
a little bit affected

19:40.222 --> 19:43.356
by lost nights screaming
and shouting like I do.

19:43.356 --> 19:47.011
My love for opera started
when I was quite young.

19:47.011 --> 19:50.145
In the car, we would have
Phantom of the Opera, the CD,

19:50.145 --> 19:53.888
and I still carry that with me.

19:53.888 --> 19:59.894
♪ Think of me, see you

19:59.894 --> 20:03.376
♪ Think of me, think of me

20:03.376 --> 20:07.858
♪ Think of me fondly

20:07.858 --> 20:09.077
You killed it.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.034
It wasn'’t bad.

20:10.034 --> 20:11.253
Amazing.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.820
The guests are going
to love you.

20:12.820 --> 20:16.215
I still believe I am destined
to be an opera singer.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.568
Yeah, goose bumps.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.178
Everything is an
extra on my body.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.527
- Sleep tight.
- It'’s all I wanted.

20:24.527 --> 20:25.789
Don'’t let the bed bugs bite.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.835
All of this we have here.

20:30.403 --> 20:33.536
Oh!

20:57.299 --> 20:58.648
The Brit is back.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.526
Hey, hey.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.354
I'’m going to make your
day now,

21:08.354 --> 21:10.791
because you'’re going
to take them diving.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.140
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.446
Ah!

21:13.446 --> 21:14.447
So you'’re going to go
this afternoon.

21:14.447 --> 21:15.752
The people that are taking them,

21:15.752 --> 21:17.450
you need to email them
your certificate

21:17.450 --> 21:18.581
and your wetsuit size.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.757
Okay.
Yes, yes, yes!

21:21.845 --> 21:24.152
All crew, all crew.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.806
Guest arrival is at 12:15.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.330
Interior, interior,
can we have a meeting

21:28.330 --> 21:30.201
in the crew mess, please?

21:32.552 --> 21:34.336
Easy peasy,
lemony squeezy.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.469
Yesterday, I ended up
finishing off the tasks.

21:36.469 --> 21:37.296
You did?

21:37.296 --> 21:38.645
Right.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.821
How do you feel
your first trip was?

21:40.821 --> 21:42.736
- The next one will be better.
- Yeah.

21:42.736 --> 21:45.216
I started off yachting
during a charter.

21:45.216 --> 21:46.348
- Yeah.
- So I get it. It'’s a lot.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.958
Everything'’s confusing.

21:47.958 --> 21:51.222
But I think the biggest thing
is like having initiative.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.615
Yeah.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.400
And we'’re obviously here
to ask questions.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.446
So, Jess, it would be great
if you could just...

21:59.056 --> 22:01.624
<i>Tumi, Tumi, Sandy.</i>

22:01.624 --> 22:03.365
Go ahead.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.672
<i>Yeah, can I get my
clothes brought up?</i>

22:05.672 --> 22:08.196
<i>I don'’t have any clean shirts.</i>

22:08.196 --> 22:09.415
Copy.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.590
I put it in this morning.

22:10.590 --> 22:13.070
Let me just double check.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.725
Okay, so with laundry,
we need to send things up.

22:15.725 --> 22:19.294
So I'’ve always like
sent things as they go,

22:19.294 --> 22:20.643
just to clear out the laundry.

22:20.643 --> 22:21.862
And it doesn'’t
look like a cluster----.

22:21.862 --> 22:23.298
It'’s not ironed.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.039
- Okay, that'’s fine.
- The iron'’s on right now.

22:25.039 --> 22:26.562
Okay.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.393
- Good morning.
- Hey, good morning.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.134
- I'’m sorry about that.
- No worries.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.397
I do bridge deck aft.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.398
Thank you, Monsieur.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.921
I love you so much.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.053
I love you too, baby.

22:39.053 --> 22:41.229
There'’s so much
sh-- still here.

22:41.229 --> 22:43.362
So I'’m like, what?
Like, what?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.102
Are you sure you finished
the list, girl?

22:45.102 --> 22:46.408
<i>Lily, Lily, Tumi.</i>

22:46.408 --> 22:47.888
<i>Can you come to
laundry, please?</i>

22:47.888 --> 22:49.585
Coming.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.892
I think she'’s going
to become very relaxed.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.415
And that'’s going to
be the downfall

22:53.415 --> 22:54.416
Very true.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.766
You didn'’t steam these.

22:56.766 --> 22:58.333
And these weren'’t done either.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.900
And Sandy'’s stuff wasn't done.

22:59.900 --> 23:04.383
My pet peeve, if you say done,
I assume it'’s done.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.906
There we go again.
Back to step one.

23:05.906 --> 23:09.344
That was a list from last night,
not the list from today.

23:09.344 --> 23:11.651
Felt like the interior
had been breaking down.

23:11.651 --> 23:14.088
And I'’m the one who's broken it.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.090
Like, everyone
doesn'’t realize how little

23:16.090 --> 23:17.570
experience I'’ve had in laundry.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.572
There was literally no
laundry room on the other boat.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.443
There'’s no winning here.

23:21.443 --> 23:24.881
It'’s only failure
and no positivity.

23:24.881 --> 23:26.274
Sorry, Jess.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.755
It'’s fine.
Just another challenge.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.321
100%.

23:34.456 --> 23:35.414
Coming up...

23:35.414 --> 23:36.980
Nice to meet you, Mike Stevens.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.636
More yacht.

23:41.550 --> 23:42.899
Why is he throwing stuff at you?

23:42.899 --> 23:44.466
- Because he'’s a dickhead.
- I'’m sorry.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.512
- We have no control of him.
- Yeah.

23:50.037 --> 23:52.735
<i>All crew, all crew,
in your whites now.</i>

23:52.735 --> 23:54.128
Let'’s meet on the dock.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.391
Is this the blue bin
you put the rags in?

23:56.391 --> 23:57.784
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:59.525 --> 24:00.526
Okay, let'’s go.

24:02.789 --> 24:03.964
Here they come.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.313
Okay, turn on that smile.

24:05.313 --> 24:08.447
I'’m so----ing excited,
I'’m jacked.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.926
Hi.

24:09.926 --> 24:11.188
Hi guys, nice to meet you.

24:11.188 --> 24:12.712
- Welcome.
- Mike Stevens.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.278
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

24:14.278 --> 24:16.106
Our chief stew Tumi'’s gonna
give you a little tour

24:16.106 --> 24:17.543
and get underway.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.283
Let'’s get this party rolling.
Let'’s go.

24:19.283 --> 24:20.633
Oh, that'’s the gang plank.

24:20.633 --> 24:23.113
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.637
- All right, cheers!
- yeah!

24:24.637 --> 24:26.116
To a good trip.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.901
Over here, this is
our main deck aft.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.946
You know you'’re on a yacht when
they have to give you a tour.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.774
Hey, Eddie!
Yo, focus!

24:31.774 --> 24:34.951
This group is already
out of control.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.300
We'’re gonna head on up.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.128
This is where you will
have most of your meals.

24:38.128 --> 24:39.303
Now we'’re talking.

24:39.303 --> 24:40.827
We can have a nice meal here.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.002
Tequila.

24:46.310 --> 24:47.660
I'’m gonna take you guys
down to your cabin.

24:47.660 --> 24:48.922
Cabins.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.793
This is the master cabin.

24:50.793 --> 24:51.838
This is our room, babe.

24:51.838 --> 24:53.274
This is amazing.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.798
Dude, I'’m so excited
to sleep with you guys.

24:55.798 --> 24:56.886
Get cozy.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.932
Oh, here are your shots.

24:58.932 --> 25:02.805
More air.
Azul and margarita.

25:02.805 --> 25:05.416
The pilot is on board.
I'’ll bring him up to the bridge.

25:05.416 --> 25:07.114
I have a margarita
made for you.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.291
There we are.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.727
Oh my gosh.

25:11.727 --> 25:12.989
These dentists are
actually having

25:12.989 --> 25:14.600
the best time of their life.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.516
Where were these guys when I
was getting my teeth extracted?

25:17.516 --> 25:20.910
It'’s literally paining
so much on the side here.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.825
You need
to see the dentist.

25:22.825 --> 25:25.132
I like that shirt, by the way.

25:25.132 --> 25:27.830
you!
Why'’s he throwing sh-- at me?

25:27.830 --> 25:29.571
Why is he throwing stuff at you?

25:29.571 --> 25:31.965
Because he'’s a dickhead.

25:33.488 --> 25:36.099
Release the lines and
start taking up on the anchor.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.666
Don'’t drop the good stuff.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.581
Okay, you'’ll cross first, Haley.

25:39.581 --> 25:40.800
- I cross.
- Yeah.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.149
He'’s gonna
be throwing sh--.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.978
I'’m sorry.
We have no control of him.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.590
<i>Okay, that is all lines on.</i>

25:48.590 --> 25:50.200
<i>Start pulling the anchor.</i>

25:50.200 --> 25:52.638
<i>You'’ve got four meters on
the port quarter.</i>

25:52.638 --> 25:55.075
<i>Eleven meters starboard side.</i>

25:55.075 --> 25:56.337
What'’s down there?

25:56.337 --> 25:57.686
That'’s the crew area.

25:57.686 --> 25:58.687
Anchor home.

25:58.687 --> 25:59.688
Yep, you are all clear.

25:59.688 --> 26:00.820
Awesome.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.169
All right, Luka, I'’m all set.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.866
Thank you very much.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.607
<i>That'’s the pilot off
and the pilot boat away.</i>

26:05.607 --> 26:07.087
This is----ing sick.

26:07.087 --> 26:09.655
It'’s sick, isn't it?

26:11.613 --> 26:12.571
Okay.

26:14.529 --> 26:15.574
Okay.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.015
Hey, Chow, let'’s go
get Amish,

26:22.015 --> 26:23.669
because we'’re gonna
sit down for lunch.

26:23.669 --> 26:24.757
Where is Amish?

26:24.757 --> 26:27.150
Go [bleep] yourself.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.195
He'’s sleeping.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.196
Is he not coming to lunch?

26:29.196 --> 26:31.024
- No.
- Perfect.

26:32.286 --> 26:33.940
Lovely.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.768
This is----ing paradise, dude.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.073
Would you like some water?

26:37.073 --> 26:38.640
Can I get you still
or sparkling?

26:41.774 --> 26:43.993
What sauce have we got here?

26:43.993 --> 26:45.386
Do you want Tabasco as well?
But I think...

26:45.386 --> 26:46.822
I put that on the table
there for you.

26:46.822 --> 26:47.910
Yeah.

26:47.910 --> 26:48.998
I don'’t owe Jack anything.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.609
This is how it is at this point.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.914
It is all work-related,

26:51.914 --> 26:53.612
and that'’s solely
what I'’m focusing on.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.049
Trying to rekindle
and become bum-chums.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.616
This is not the place.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.052
She likes a lot of nuts.

26:59.052 --> 27:02.403
Yeah, I do too.
Trust me.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.452
Okay, get back to work.

27:08.452 --> 27:09.323
What'’s up?

27:09.323 --> 27:10.672
Where have you been all day?

27:10.672 --> 27:11.717
Haven'’t seen you all day.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.544
Why are you always hiding?

27:13.544 --> 27:15.808
You know what?
You'’re always gone.

27:15.808 --> 27:16.809
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.201
I'’m so busy.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.289
Usually, if I'’m not
in a relationship,

27:19.289 --> 27:23.729
I'’m doing a fling, I guess, so.

27:23.729 --> 27:27.646
I don'’t normally get
into trouble, but if I am,

27:27.646 --> 27:31.084
it'’s usually got something
to do with the ladies.

27:31.084 --> 27:34.174
Always bites me.

27:34.174 --> 27:36.350
- Okay, bye.
- Ciao.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.482
- This.
- The whole thing, right?

27:39.788 --> 27:41.137
Ooh, I love the zucchini.

27:41.137 --> 27:42.486
- Here'’s a nice one.
- Clear.

27:42.486 --> 27:46.621
We have skirt steak
and chimichurri.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.101
Clam and muscle vongole.

27:48.101 --> 27:49.319
Wow, look at that.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.494
- This is as good as it gets.
- Yeah.

27:50.494 --> 27:51.800
- Very blessed.
- They'’re happy.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.367
Good.

27:53.367 --> 27:54.977
Italians don'’t serve
spaghetti without a spoon.

27:54.977 --> 27:56.022
Yeah, yeah.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.632
I'’m double-fisting.

27:57.632 --> 27:58.981
What do I do next?

27:58.981 --> 28:02.289
Oh!

28:02.289 --> 28:04.683
So, if I have all the
deck hands on deck,

28:04.683 --> 28:07.990
send me someone down here
to take the garbage out, please.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.210
One on garbage,
like the whole boat.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.081
<i>Max is on his way.</i>

28:12.081 --> 28:13.300
You can go set the
anchor through

28:13.300 --> 28:14.736
the water line, starboard.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.173
You guys are going at 4:30,
I believe, for the dive.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.480
And then as the rest
of the crew

28:19.480 --> 28:20.829
just want to do
some watersports here.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.396
Yes.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.833
We'’re going to get the slide
and everything out.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.400
Droppy, droppy.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.317
That'’s four shackles out.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.623
<i>Great, I'’m all set.
Thank you.</i>

28:32.623 --> 28:33.799
Should we start with the tender
and the skis?

28:33.799 --> 28:35.496
Yeah.

28:35.496 --> 28:37.541
<i>Haleigh and Max, can you go to
the swim platform, please?</i>

28:37.541 --> 28:39.674
Max, can you come help
us with the tender?

28:39.674 --> 28:40.762
I can.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.459
- Okay, ready, coming up?
- Coming up.

28:47.813 --> 28:48.727
It'’s almost ready, buddy.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.774
He'’ll do it.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.384
Oh, [bleep]!

28:54.384 --> 28:55.429
Yes!

28:55.429 --> 28:57.083
Ah!

29:00.913 --> 29:02.088
Hey, guys.

29:04.699 --> 29:05.482
Oh, okay.

29:05.482 --> 29:06.657
What'’s your time then?

29:06.657 --> 29:08.268
4:13.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.357
I'’m the late one now,
but I'’m on till 12.

29:10.357 --> 29:11.575
That'’s the problem.

29:11.575 --> 29:12.576
Luka!

29:12.576 --> 29:13.795
Yeah?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.188
- Who stays up late?
- I'’m on 'til 12.

29:15.188 --> 29:16.189
She'’s on 'til 12.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.973
Problem is from 12 til 3.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.888
That'’s when I'm running up
and down, I'’m making cocktails.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.585
That'’s what killed me last time.

29:21.585 --> 29:23.587
I take the break
two hours, wake up,

29:23.587 --> 29:25.502
then I go to sleep
when Kyle wakes up

29:25.502 --> 29:26.895
and I wake up when
Kyle wakes up.

29:26.895 --> 29:28.114
Yeah, perfect.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.203
I will just take an
earlier break

29:30.203 --> 29:34.076
so that I can help Kyle out
until a bit later.

29:34.076 --> 29:38.341
So my duty as a lead deckhand:
help out wherever needed.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.822
So Luka'’s going to have
to adjust the schedule

29:40.822 --> 29:43.782
to fit into everyone'’s
sleeping patterns.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.479
And if I get tired,
I get cranky

29:45.479 --> 29:48.787
and it'’s not a good
look if I get cranky.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.310
Not cute.

29:51.180 --> 29:52.834
Second chile.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.227
And break.

29:55.663 --> 29:57.708
Here'’s the diving boat, guys.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.188
Hi.

29:59.188 --> 30:01.408
Luka, Luka, the guest
on the way down. Four guests.

30:01.408 --> 30:05.107
<i>Simon and Amy
are staying behind.</i>

30:05.107 --> 30:06.282
I'’m Haleigh.

30:06.282 --> 30:07.544
- Linda.
- Linda.

30:07.544 --> 30:09.938
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.331
So what, we'’re just
doing the one tank.

30:11.331 --> 30:12.941
At the price of the others.

30:12.941 --> 30:15.639
Okay.

30:15.639 --> 30:17.467
I know, I'’m so very excited.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.382
This is my bread
and butter, right?

30:19.382 --> 30:21.689
Max, Max, come to
the swim platform, please.

30:21.689 --> 30:23.343
- You and Max are going?
- Yeah.

30:23.343 --> 30:26.520
Grab all this stuff,
towels, drinks, snorkel.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.437
Enjoy, guys.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.444
Oh, thank God, they left.

30:37.444 --> 30:38.837
I'’m going down.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.273
- What are you doing?
- Look at this ashtray.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.188
Is that from you
being here for two days?

30:42.188 --> 30:43.580
- No.
- That'’s disgusting.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.800
Oh, my God.
What a day.

30:45.800 --> 30:46.757
Why?

31:13.175 --> 31:14.176
Coming up...

31:14.176 --> 31:15.177
Where are the deck hands?

31:15.177 --> 31:16.744
Max, where are you guys?

31:19.921 --> 31:21.096
I need someone on deck.

31:21.096 --> 31:22.358
You.

31:22.358 --> 31:23.882
You got to figure
your schedule out.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.709
This is the stuff
that makes me mad.

31:29.931 --> 31:32.673
Let'’s get this party started.

31:32.673 --> 31:35.545
Okay, do you want the black ones
or the blue ones?

31:35.545 --> 31:36.895
Oh, I don'’t care.

31:38.244 --> 31:41.203
Just pull as much
as you can, all right?

31:41.203 --> 31:43.640
You can sit there, and I can
help you put them on for you.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.468
- Sure, I'’ll do that.
- Okay.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.216
Diving is what started me
out in being on boats

31:54.216 --> 31:56.349
and, like,
my whole ocean career.

31:56.349 --> 31:58.655
I have over
15,000 vlogged dives.

31:58.655 --> 32:01.006
Yachting'’s not, like,
super familiar for me,

32:01.006 --> 32:02.703
but, like, diving is.

32:02.703 --> 32:05.575
Like, that is one thing I
really, really----ing know.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.664
And also, too,
like, I don'’t have to talk

32:07.664 --> 32:10.885
when I'’m underwater.

32:10.885 --> 32:13.888
That'’s pretty----ing cool,
too, so...

32:19.372 --> 32:20.895
Whoo!

32:20.895 --> 32:21.896
Did you touch it?

32:21.896 --> 32:22.897
Yeah!

32:40.436 --> 32:42.047
Did you just
put alcohol in this?

32:42.047 --> 32:44.353
Um, I used that spray bottle.

32:44.353 --> 32:45.572
The vinegar one?

32:45.572 --> 32:46.747
No, the alcohol one.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.314
You think it was
either or, to be honest.

32:48.314 --> 32:49.358
Okay, that'’s what I've done.

32:49.358 --> 32:50.881
I don'’t like to train.

32:50.881 --> 32:53.058
I like people to
just know what to do,

32:53.058 --> 32:55.408
but Tumi is my chief stew
at the end of the day,

32:55.408 --> 32:57.976
so I just have to
do what I'’m told.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.064
Wait, does this even fit?

32:59.064 --> 33:00.543
No, this is not going to fit.

33:00.543 --> 33:02.023
I don'’t like
to teach people things.

33:02.023 --> 33:05.026
I'’m a sponge.
You can be a sponge.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.463
Do you want to just knock
out that primary dress first?

33:07.463 --> 33:09.378
Okay, yeah.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.688
What are you doing?
You'’re in the tender.

33:27.831 --> 33:29.311
Okay.

33:30.965 --> 33:33.272
Who hasn'’t gone on a break?
No one'’s gone on a break.

33:33.272 --> 33:34.621
On a break?

33:34.621 --> 33:35.926
Yeah, no one'’s
had one, have they?

33:35.926 --> 33:38.320
- We'’ll figure it out.
- Yeah.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.366
- This is now done.
- Now done?

33:42.846 --> 33:43.934
Okay.

33:43.934 --> 33:44.892
All right. Cheers.

33:47.982 --> 33:50.158
There'’s the napkin cupboards,
then there'’s rings.

33:50.158 --> 33:52.726
Underneath the rings,
you'’ll see space.

33:52.726 --> 33:53.814
Thanks.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.645
You can take those napkins out.

33:58.645 --> 34:00.690
Do the same thing,
but do it with the black.

34:02.649 --> 34:03.867
There you go.

34:03.867 --> 34:04.912
Like this?

34:04.912 --> 34:06.435
Yeah.

34:06.435 --> 34:08.742
And then you fold that way,
that other way,

34:08.742 --> 34:10.309
and then you just
put the ring on.

34:10.309 --> 34:13.312
It'’s important for me to show
Lily how to fold napkins

34:13.312 --> 34:17.751
or train her in some way,
because she needs to learn.

34:17.751 --> 34:20.449
And I also want to
cover my tracks, you know?

34:20.449 --> 34:22.669
Like, I want to say,
I showed you.

34:22.669 --> 34:25.150
But could you imagine
if she came up as a top stew?

34:25.150 --> 34:27.500
I would be like, I did that,
I groomed you.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.023
It'’s a pleasure.

34:29.023 --> 34:30.677
I'’m going to change.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.592
- Yeah, you go change.
- Okay, I'’ll be back.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.898
Okay, are we ready to go back?

34:34.898 --> 34:36.378
Yeah?

34:38.206 --> 34:39.381
Oh, yeah.

34:48.738 --> 34:50.349
Copy that.
I think we can see you.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.177
Look at her drive that boat.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.440
- She'’s a pro.
- She is.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.138
The tongs.

34:57.138 --> 34:58.531
Hey, Haleigh.

34:58.531 --> 35:00.228
- How was it?
- Good, how are you?

35:00.228 --> 35:01.925
Good.

35:01.925 --> 35:03.579
Yeah, she is great.

35:09.237 --> 35:12.153
We'’d definitely rather
give Max or Haleigh a break.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.851
A person that'’s in a little
bit of a higher position

35:14.851 --> 35:17.898
should never take a break
before their teammates.

35:17.898 --> 35:19.987
Luka knew that we
had an excursion

35:19.987 --> 35:22.163
since the beginning
of the charters.

35:22.163 --> 35:25.166
So at that stage,
should have given breaks

35:25.166 --> 35:26.515
earlier before that.

35:26.515 --> 35:28.691
But it'’s just what it is.

35:28.691 --> 35:30.650
You know, I'’m not going
to throw a hissy fit

35:30.650 --> 35:32.130
or a tantrum like Max.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.393
Just come back for
one hour to help us pack up

35:34.393 --> 35:35.785
and then you'’ll finish
for the night.

35:37.439 --> 35:39.659
What?
What is your problem?

35:39.659 --> 35:41.400
One way in, one way out.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.228
Can you shut up a little bit?

35:43.228 --> 35:44.577
My friend it'’s so heavy.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.187
What the [bleep]?

35:46.187 --> 35:48.929
We don'’t have time to----ing
sit around and wank.

35:48.929 --> 35:51.366
I'’m just going to deal with it.

35:54.239 --> 35:55.631
Hello, Tumi'’s phone.

35:55.631 --> 35:57.894
Hi Mateo. Fantastic.

35:57.894 --> 36:00.201
I will call you back shortly
with regards to everything else.

36:00.201 --> 36:02.943
Thank you so much.

36:02.943 --> 36:05.685
Your act is at
the dock for pickup.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.949
Sweet baby Jesus.
Let me go find him, here.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.300
What'’s wrong?

36:12.300 --> 36:13.562
I need a mentalist
to be picked up.

36:13.562 --> 36:14.955
What'’s mentalist?

36:14.955 --> 36:17.000
That'’s the person
that reads your mind.

36:19.307 --> 36:20.526
We can launch a tender,

36:20.526 --> 36:22.092
but it'’ll take us
15, 20 minutes.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.659
We'’ll have to put
it in the water.

36:26.096 --> 36:28.577
There could have been better
communication on both parts,

36:28.577 --> 36:30.013
but it would have been nice

36:30.013 --> 36:31.667
if, like, maybe Luka
came up to me and said,

36:31.667 --> 36:33.278
yo, do you need
a tender later on?

36:33.278 --> 36:34.801
We'’re pulling it up.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.803
That'’s what's happened
on my past boats.

36:36.803 --> 36:39.240
Yo, we'’re going
to launch a tender.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.286
Why are we launching a tender?

36:41.286 --> 36:42.504
She needs someone picked up.

36:42.504 --> 36:43.984
We need someone
picked up at the dock.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.986
Christ! Why didn'’t you
say something before it?

36:45.986 --> 36:48.684
To me, it'’s pretty
- ing straightforward.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.947
The bosun goes,
talk to the chief stew,

36:50.947 --> 36:53.036
they communicate about what'’s
going to happen later on

36:53.036 --> 36:54.734
during the day,
during the night.

36:54.734 --> 36:57.171
This is definitely the
first time that some cracks

36:57.171 --> 37:00.740
are showing in their
experience in these positions.

37:00.740 --> 37:03.786
Like, what did you guys do
the whole day on the boat?

37:03.786 --> 37:05.832
Have a----ing tea party,
you know?

37:05.832 --> 37:08.051
How'’s that----ing end, bro?

37:13.143 --> 37:15.363
I'’ll pick them up, Max,
you can go down and shower.

37:15.363 --> 37:16.495
You want I go, bro?

37:16.495 --> 37:18.192
No, no, you go on a break.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.672
I got it.

37:26.156 --> 37:28.507
Dinner'’s tonight.
It'’s going to be three courses.

37:28.507 --> 37:30.900
I know Americans
love pork belly, right?

37:32.424 --> 37:33.816
Yeah, right?

37:33.816 --> 37:35.253
Well, I'’m going with it.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.777
Pork belly is quite popular
in Northern Italy.

37:37.777 --> 37:40.345
I'’m going to roll the
pork belly in honey as well

37:40.345 --> 37:42.303
to give it a nice caramelization.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.174
Mamma mia.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.223
Ciao.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.398
You can come on.

37:50.398 --> 37:52.966
- Perfect.
- Hey.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.837
Looks good.

37:57.405 --> 37:58.711
Copy, on my way.

37:59.886 --> 38:01.366
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks, are you?

38:01.366 --> 38:03.193
I'’m good.

38:03.193 --> 38:04.369
I hear you'’ve got magic powers.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.022
Yeah.

38:06.022 --> 38:09.330
My whole thing is if guests
are happy, then I'’m happy.

38:09.330 --> 38:10.679
Mm!

38:10.679 --> 38:12.725
And right now,
there'’s no complaints.

38:13.987 --> 38:14.857
007.

38:14.857 --> 38:17.643
I didn'’t, like, [bleep] up.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.122
No, I can actually
do something right.

38:19.122 --> 38:21.168
Miss Moneypenny.

38:21.168 --> 38:23.344
- 006 is right here.
- You'’re an idiot.

38:23.344 --> 38:24.519
Shut the [bleep] up.

38:24.519 --> 38:25.912
The mentalist is
ready for you guys.

38:25.912 --> 38:27.522
- What is?
- The mentalist.

38:27.522 --> 38:28.697
Right out here.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.177
Let'’s go.

38:30.177 --> 38:31.352
Just some fun
times before dinner.

38:31.352 --> 38:32.701
Ooh.

38:32.701 --> 38:35.617
How many of you know
what a mentalist is?

38:37.140 --> 38:39.969
I have no idea what
the [bleep] is going on.

38:39.969 --> 38:42.102
I accuse you, but you have a
drink, you [bleep] head.

38:42.102 --> 38:45.105
I don'’t think anyone
knows what a mentalist is.

38:45.105 --> 38:47.890
Can you pay them not
to read my mind?

38:47.890 --> 38:50.763
Now I want to try an experiment.

38:50.763 --> 38:52.591
Can I ask you to help me?

38:52.591 --> 38:55.898
I'’m going to ask you to think
about a very famous place

38:55.898 --> 38:58.379
that you'’ve never been before,

38:58.379 --> 39:00.599
but maybe you want
to visit in the future.

39:00.599 --> 39:03.253
Try to project to me this place.

39:03.253 --> 39:07.040
For the first time,
can you tell everybody

39:07.040 --> 39:08.955
what place are you
thinking about?

39:08.955 --> 39:10.522
- Australia.
- Australia.

39:10.522 --> 39:12.175
- Like this?
- Yes.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.090
Oh sh--.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.048
Amazing.

39:15.048 --> 39:16.310
- Really?
- Thank you very much.

39:16.310 --> 39:17.703
This was amazing.

39:17.703 --> 39:19.444
Lara, Lara.
You can go down.

39:19.444 --> 39:22.316
Copy that.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.752
Think about a card.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.319
Please write it here. Okay.

39:25.319 --> 39:27.539
Under the cards.
Please draw something.

39:27.539 --> 39:31.412
Can you tell all of us what'’s
the card are you thinking about?

39:31.412 --> 39:33.196
- The King of Spades.
- The King of Spades.

39:33.196 --> 39:36.156
- Yes.
- Please show it to everybody.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.636
Oh, my goodness!

39:37.636 --> 39:38.811
Oh shoot.

39:38.811 --> 39:41.161
That was amazing.

39:41.161 --> 39:42.771
How'’s it going?

39:45.731 --> 39:49.909
You also have like a sort of
drawing in your mind, correct?

39:49.909 --> 39:51.737
Can you see what you draw?

39:51.737 --> 39:53.129
- Sure.
- Okay.

39:53.129 --> 39:54.392
What is it?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.611
- It'’s a spade.
- Ah, it'’s a spade.

39:56.611 --> 39:58.004
So...

39:58.004 --> 39:59.440
Maybe something like this.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.441
Yeah.

40:04.140 --> 40:06.447
Thank you.
You are awesome.

40:06.447 --> 40:07.796
Bravo. Bravo.

40:07.796 --> 40:09.798
- Thank you.
- Bravo. Bravo.

40:09.798 --> 40:11.452
Thank you.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.323
Tumi, the mentalist is
ready to go back to the dock.

40:13.323 --> 40:14.542
Copy.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.370
- Mine is in my...
- Thank you, my friend.

40:16.370 --> 40:17.458
Thank you.

40:17.458 --> 40:18.546
Chef, Chef, Tumi.

40:18.546 --> 40:20.113
- 15 minutes?
- Copy.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:21.680 --> 40:22.681
- Really nice to meet you.
- See you.

40:22.681 --> 40:23.943
Bye.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.032
Did you enjoy your nap?

40:26.032 --> 40:27.076
Oh, it was amazing.

40:27.076 --> 40:28.469
I don'’t remember falling asleep.

40:28.469 --> 40:29.688
We touched Jesus.

40:29.688 --> 40:31.559
You touched Jesus?

40:31.559 --> 40:33.082
It was weird.

40:33.082 --> 40:34.997
And that'’s when you feel
like everyone

40:34.997 --> 40:35.998
in interior didn'’t like me.

40:35.998 --> 40:37.347
No, it'’s not that.

40:37.347 --> 40:39.219
I think if Tumi and Kyle
see you working hard

40:39.219 --> 40:40.481
and always doing something...

40:40.481 --> 40:41.569
Yeah.

40:41.569 --> 40:42.527
Then they'’ll respect you more.

40:42.527 --> 40:43.963
Yeah.

40:43.963 --> 40:46.444
<i>Do we have any deck
hand available</i>

40:46.444 --> 40:49.403
<i>just to carry
things up, please?</i>

40:52.537 --> 40:55.453
<i>Deck crew, deck crew,
come in for Kyle.</i>

40:55.453 --> 40:56.889
Are these clear, yeah?

40:56.889 --> 40:58.194
Yeah, they'’re clear now, man.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.195
Okay.

40:59.195 --> 41:00.240
Oh, don'’t forget
the toiletries.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.372
Yeah, I haven'’t done that yet.

41:04.418 --> 41:05.811
Ah!

41:05.811 --> 41:08.727
This looks good.
I need some chocolates.

41:08.727 --> 41:10.903
So your first course,
pork belly,

41:10.903 --> 41:13.993
pork cuervos, apple puree
and carrot salad.

41:13.993 --> 41:15.908
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

41:15.908 --> 41:17.692
- Thank you.
- Really hot.

41:17.692 --> 41:19.302
Pork chops and applesauce.

41:20.521 --> 41:21.870
- Okay.
- Okay, ciao.

41:21.870 --> 41:23.306
Bye, ciao. Grazi.

41:23.306 --> 41:25.265
Howdy, Luka. If you can
just send some assistance

41:25.265 --> 41:27.702
<i>in the galley just to clear
some of these dishes.</i>

41:27.702 --> 41:29.051
Where'’d you get those shades?

41:29.051 --> 41:30.488
If I told you I'’d
have to kill you.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.273
- Are they X-ray?
- The only reason I wear them.

41:33.273 --> 41:35.101
X-ray, baby.

41:35.101 --> 41:36.450
Is any of the
deck hands helping?

41:36.450 --> 41:37.756
No.

41:37.756 --> 41:39.714
Luka has gone to go
drop off my mentalist.

41:39.714 --> 41:41.150
But where are the rest of them?

41:41.150 --> 41:43.501
<i>Deck team, deck team.
Is anyone up?</i>

41:43.501 --> 41:46.460
<i>Max, Max, come in for Kyle.</i>

41:46.460 --> 41:47.983
Anybody answer you?

41:49.811 --> 41:51.987
Where are the deck hands?

41:51.987 --> 41:54.555
Max, where are you guys?

41:54.555 --> 41:56.992
Max, where are the deck hands?

41:56.992 --> 41:58.428
Luka, where is everybody?

41:58.428 --> 41:59.952
No.

41:59.952 --> 42:02.084
I'’m here. Lara's just in
the cabin and Max is down.

42:02.084 --> 42:05.610
We only got you on deck?

42:05.610 --> 42:06.741
That'’s not okay.

42:06.741 --> 42:07.960
I can get Lara as well.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.744
Yeah, we need help with service.

42:09.744 --> 42:11.877
We always have
two people on deck.

42:11.877 --> 42:13.443
<i>This isn'’t okay, Luka.</i>

42:13.443 --> 42:15.402
Okay, sorry about that.

42:22.670 --> 42:24.846
I need someone on deck, you.

42:24.846 --> 42:26.979
Are you usually on
deck at this time?

42:32.637 --> 42:34.813
Okay, but I need...
you gotta come on deck.

42:34.813 --> 42:37.076
It'’s important to have at
least two deck hands on board

42:37.076 --> 42:38.338
in case of an emergency.

42:38.338 --> 42:39.905
I have to be able to maneuver.

42:39.905 --> 42:41.297
We have to haul the anchor.

42:41.297 --> 42:44.518
Not only is it safety,
we have guests on board.

42:44.518 --> 42:45.998
It'’s about service.

42:45.998 --> 42:48.435
The deck team, they'’re there
to support the interior

42:48.435 --> 42:50.698
because now it'’s all about
the food, the service,

42:50.698 --> 42:52.265
because there'’s
no water sports.

42:52.265 --> 42:53.483
- He'’s got to figure this out.
- I'’m coming.

42:53.483 --> 42:54.441
Okay.

42:54.441 --> 42:56.486
You can'’t only have one person.

42:56.486 --> 42:57.531
I need two.

42:57.531 --> 42:58.793
I'’m not happy.

42:58.793 --> 42:59.838
Luka, where are you?

42:59.838 --> 43:01.535
I'’m coming to the crew mess.

43:01.535 --> 43:02.667
I'’m not very happy.

43:02.667 --> 43:03.668
Okay.

43:03.668 --> 43:04.799
The priority is this.

43:04.799 --> 43:06.061
- Yeah.
- The food.

43:06.061 --> 43:08.455
- Okay.
- Get Max up.

43:08.455 --> 43:09.848
This is the stuff
that makes me mad.

43:09.848 --> 43:11.110
Okay.

43:11.110 --> 43:12.546
You got to figure
your schedule out.

43:12.546 --> 43:14.069
It'’s just they
didn'’t get a break.

43:14.069 --> 43:15.549
I don'’t like when
she calls and calls.

43:15.549 --> 43:17.377
The deck crew needs
to----ing answer.

43:17.377 --> 43:18.378
Okay.

43:20.554 --> 43:21.729
ing hell.

43:23.165 --> 43:26.125
Next time on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

43:26.125 --> 43:27.430
I can'’t trust her.

43:27.430 --> 43:29.215
There'’s towels
all over the floor.

43:29.215 --> 43:30.956
You haven'’t done the twin.

43:30.956 --> 43:33.654
My patience is gone.

43:33.654 --> 43:36.614
Under those conditions is
how I decide to keep crew.

43:38.659 --> 43:40.095
You okay?

43:40.095 --> 43:41.923
There'’s something not right
with me right now.

43:41.923 --> 43:43.664
Can I get a ride for a
crew member

43:43.664 --> 43:44.622
to get them to the doctor?

43:49.627 --> 43:50.628
Oh.

43:54.196 --> 43:55.676
It'’s not fun for me
to tell you this.

43:58.461 --> 43:59.462
He'’s a problem.

43:59.462 --> 44:01.639
You have to get
him under control.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.075
Under control, got it.

44:03.075 --> 44:04.990
Or he'’s off the boat.
