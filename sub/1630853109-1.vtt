WEBVTT

01:34.929 --> 01:38.304
Do you, Alice,

01:38.339 --> 01:41.340
take Joseph...

01:41.375 --> 01:44.343
to be your husband

01:44.378 --> 01:48.842
in sickness and in health...

01:48.877 --> 01:52.846
until distance do you part?

01:55.224 --> 01:57.785
I do.

01:57.820 --> 02:00.722
And do you, Joseph,

02:00.757 --> 02:06.266
take Alice to be your wife...

02:06.301 --> 02:10.468
in sickness
and in health

02:10.503 --> 02:14.703
until distance do you part?

02:14.738 --> 02:16.507
I do.

02:18.775 --> 02:22.381
I now pronounce you...

02:22.416 --> 02:25.714
man and wife.

02:29.786 --> 02:31.489
Joseph!

02:31.524 --> 02:33.293
Joseph!

02:34.824 --> 02:36.593
Joseph!

02:48.035 --> 02:52.345
The Lord has decided
that he needed to test us.

02:52.380 --> 02:57.251
-Mr. Paul?
-The deed has been done.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.552
It wasn't a rabbit.

03:01.587 --> 03:04.357
You arrogance blinded you,
Joseph.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.920
We'll note it for Sunday.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.298
Now grab one end.

03:24.577 --> 03:27.710
He said,
"If you will diligently listen

03:27.745 --> 03:30.482
to the voice of the Lord,
your God,

03:30.517 --> 03:34.915
and do that
which is right in His eyes...

03:36.754 --> 03:40.789
...give ears to His commands
and keep all His statutes,

03:40.824 --> 03:43.561
I will put none
of the diseases on you

03:43.596 --> 03:45.431
that I put on the Egyptians...

03:47.600 --> 03:51.932
...for I am the Lord,
your healer."

04:08.984 --> 04:11.556
Mr. Paul.
Mr. Paul!

04:11.591 --> 04:12.722
Mr. Paul!
I caught a rat!

04:23.900 --> 04:26.472
Don't even think
about helping him up.

04:26.507 --> 04:28.001
He did this on his own.

04:28.036 --> 04:31.004
He can get up on his own.

04:43.755 --> 04:46.822
Y'all heard him.
Get back to work!

04:46.857 --> 04:48.791
Back to work.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.367
Back to work, boy.

05:04.413 --> 05:06.446
-Hold still.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.752
Ruthie?

05:15.787 --> 05:18.392
You can't be sneaking over here
and playing like this.

05:18.427 --> 05:19.954
As the oldest woman
in this bunch,

05:19.989 --> 05:22.154
I think I can do just about
anything I want to do.

05:22.189 --> 05:25.531
And right now,
I want to see my son.

05:29.966 --> 05:34.133
Best not to hear
those stories tonight, Alice.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.970
Her reading's
the only thing we got.

05:39.547 --> 05:42.449
We can't keep doing this.

05:42.484 --> 05:44.946
We thank keep letting Mr. Paul
do what he wants.

05:46.686 --> 05:48.950
It's a choice
we don't have to make.

05:48.985 --> 05:51.018
If any one of us
start acting up,

05:51.053 --> 05:52.756
you know what would happen?

05:52.791 --> 05:54.087
We'd all die.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.432
There's 12 of us.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.665
There's one of him.

06:00.700 --> 06:03.635
Three if you count
Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Aaron.

06:03.670 --> 06:06.132
Not all of us had the teaching
from Mr. Paul you had.

06:06.167 --> 06:07.738
How?

06:07.773 --> 06:10.741
The men that hunt runaways
work at night.

06:10.776 --> 06:13.106
We've all heard the stories.

06:13.141 --> 06:15.647
I ain't never heard of them
hunting in the day.

06:15.682 --> 06:17.077
It won't work, Alice.

06:17.112 --> 06:20.014
She ain't wrong
for thinking about it.

06:20.049 --> 06:23.655
None of us are.

06:23.690 --> 06:26.053
There's got to be
something else.

06:26.088 --> 06:28.957
A bunch of white men
out there waiting...

06:28.992 --> 06:32.059
to kill us, keep us, or sell us.

06:33.128 --> 06:34.930
I need to speak to my wife.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.504
Alone.

06:47.780 --> 06:50.110
-Joseph, this place --
-Paul knows.

06:51.212 --> 06:54.653
About us.

06:54.688 --> 06:56.787
About everything.

08:02.019 --> 08:04.085
No, my brothers and sisters!

08:04.120 --> 08:07.561
This was no messenger from God.

08:07.596 --> 08:11.224
This was a warning
from the devil himself.

08:14.834 --> 08:18.605
Even in our gracious state
of Georgia...

08:18.640 --> 08:21.168
on God-given land,

08:21.203 --> 08:24.875
the devil has ways
of sending an emissary.

08:26.879 --> 08:31.882
He said, "You must continue
to be fruitful.

08:33.688 --> 08:38.053
Not only for yourselves,
but for your domestic livestock,

08:38.088 --> 08:42.321
for they, too, must be bathed
in the bounty of birth.

08:44.798 --> 08:47.326
Or I will...

08:47.361 --> 08:51.198
take it all away."

09:11.792 --> 09:14.056
I need to have
a word with you.

09:36.014 --> 09:40.951
How long has it been
since we lost your beloved?

09:45.353 --> 09:47.287
Long time ago.

09:52.129 --> 09:55.097
I've always tried my best
to take care of you.

09:55.132 --> 09:56.769
Haven't I?

10:05.142 --> 10:07.373
You want to be inside.
Is that it?

10:11.214 --> 10:12.917
No, sir.

10:12.952 --> 10:14.721
A home life.

10:16.384 --> 10:19.286
This is what you're longing for,
isn't it?

10:19.321 --> 10:23.730
When your wife passed...
I should've married you off.

10:25.096 --> 10:28.394
Could have had sons
working by your side.

10:29.364 --> 10:31.001
Mr. Paul, I --

10:31.036 --> 10:32.739
Our neighbor, Brother Levi,

10:32.774 --> 10:36.171
has offered one of his domestics
to be your bride.

10:42.146 --> 10:44.245
I'm happy, Mr. Paul.

10:45.754 --> 10:48.788
I-I work hard.
I-I don't need --

10:48.823 --> 10:51.824
The message was clear.
You need to be fruitful.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.892
Along with
the other domestics.

10:53.927 --> 10:57.390
This -- This is a big thing
Brother Levi is doing for us.

10:58.833 --> 11:01.163
He hasn't been as blessed
with his domestics.

11:05.136 --> 11:07.268
We've agreed
that the first child

11:07.303 --> 11:10.403
will rightfully go to him.

11:12.946 --> 11:16.882
You'll leave this week to...

11:19.183 --> 11:21.150
...to procreate.

11:22.857 --> 11:25.055
And then, when the pregnancy
is confirmed,

11:25.090 --> 11:27.189
you can return.

11:38.565 --> 11:42.237
This is so much bigger
than -- than us.

11:57.925 --> 12:01.322
Daniel's coming home tomorrow.

12:01.357 --> 12:03.159
MRS.
And Rachel.

12:07.836 --> 12:10.529
She's been gone a long time now.

12:13.138 --> 12:15.435
Your mind's not
what it used to be, Mother.

12:27.383 --> 12:29.152
It's Sunday.

12:49.878 --> 12:51.273
I said it's Sunday.

12:57.050 --> 12:58.819
I know.

13:01.285 --> 13:02.515
You go on ahead of me.

13:06.323 --> 13:08.961
What about Mrs. Bennett?

13:10.657 --> 13:13.064
Ruth can put her to bed.

14:57.005 --> 14:59.269
Nobody said you could sit there.

15:18.026 --> 15:19.718
You think you look like this?

15:23.163 --> 15:25.196
I just looked at the picture.

15:25.231 --> 15:26.626
I didn't...

15:26.661 --> 15:30.201
You don't read good enough
to understand...

15:30.236 --> 15:32.500
the meaning, Alice.

15:35.439 --> 15:37.307
I-I only taught you

15:37.342 --> 15:41.410
so you could read to me
as a domestic.

15:41.445 --> 15:43.544
Understand?

15:46.120 --> 15:48.120
Understand?

15:48.155 --> 15:49.484
Yes.

15:49.519 --> 15:50.749
Good.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.390
Sit.

15:57.758 --> 15:59.362
On the bed.

16:39.107 --> 16:41.272
Have you ever thought
about running away?

16:42.008 --> 16:46.046
Pondering is only
gonna make you feel worse.

16:49.381 --> 16:51.480
Have you ever thought about it?

16:53.484 --> 16:55.286
We don't --
We don't talk about that.

16:55.321 --> 16:57.684
I didn't ask
if we talked about it.

16:57.719 --> 17:00.357
I asked you
if you thought about it.

17:06.167 --> 17:08.860
Used to.

17:08.895 --> 17:13.337
But I just chose
not to see things

17:13.372 --> 17:14.866
out of my control.

17:14.901 --> 17:18.738
That kind of thinking
will get you killed.

17:20.577 --> 17:23.512
You ever hear stories
about anyone making it out?

17:28.321 --> 17:29.749
Your granddaddy...

17:32.622 --> 17:36.723
...once said he -- he saw a man.

17:43.336 --> 17:45.336
One of us.

17:48.473 --> 17:50.341
As if...

17:50.376 --> 17:53.674
As if he just fell from the sky.

17:59.385 --> 18:01.847
Could start a fire
with his hands.

18:06.359 --> 18:08.128
Mm-hmm.

18:13.234 --> 18:15.399
He's still out there.

18:16.666 --> 18:19.403
My daddy...

18:19.438 --> 18:23.440
buried him over in that --
in that corral.

18:24.075 --> 18:29.182
Strangest-looking man
he'd ever seen.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.746
-Did you see him?
-Oh, no, I wasn't --

18:32.781 --> 18:34.781
I wasn't trying to.

19:39.045 --> 19:42.981
What are you doing?
What are you doing, son?

19:43.016 --> 19:44.884
What are you --

20:47.487 --> 20:49.751
We can fix those.

20:52.756 --> 20:54.624
You like your schoolin'?

20:57.398 --> 21:00.465
Well, I'll bet you have
a lot of friends.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.830
Not really.

21:02.865 --> 21:05.932
Well, you know what that means.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.000
You're a smarter person.

21:08.035 --> 21:11.476
They don't understand you.

21:11.511 --> 21:13.610
A man is rich
not by what he owns,

21:13.645 --> 21:15.843
but by what he can do without.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.850
Mrs. Bennett awake?

21:22.885 --> 21:25.358
Mm-hmm.
She's in the sitting room.

21:25.393 --> 21:27.987
Well, get her.
Her grandson's home.

21:29.991 --> 21:31.562
Hi, Mr. Daniel.

21:33.060 --> 21:34.697
Hi.

21:37.768 --> 21:40.505
You hungry?

21:40.540 --> 21:43.838
Make something
for me and my boy.

21:59.427 --> 22:01.526
Can't you see?

23:17.934 --> 23:19.967
Mrs. Bennett.

23:20.002 --> 23:21.705
Mrs. --

23:24.611 --> 23:26.105
I was a dancer, you know.

23:26.140 --> 23:28.613
In Chicago.

23:31.651 --> 23:34.553
Mrs. Bennett...

23:34.588 --> 23:36.522
what's out there?

23:36.557 --> 23:39.250
The whole world.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.758
Don't you see it?

24:06.884 --> 24:09.082
I found this.

24:09.117 --> 24:11.183
What is it?

24:11.218 --> 24:14.527
Something from somewhere.

24:14.562 --> 24:17.057
Someone from someplace.

24:17.928 --> 24:19.796
Who?

24:19.831 --> 24:21.996
Someone like us.

24:22.031 --> 24:24.933
There's more than we know...

24:24.968 --> 24:26.902
more than we can see.

24:29.973 --> 24:32.039
We have to go.

24:32.074 --> 24:33.876
-I don't know.
-We'll go.

24:33.911 --> 24:37.275
If we make it out,
we come back for everyone

24:37.310 --> 24:39.145
and burn this place
to the ground.

24:42.249 --> 24:44.018
Aaron's got a gun.

24:44.053 --> 24:46.185
You let me worry about that.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.570
What if...

24:59.838 --> 25:02.641
What if there's nothing
out there?

25:03.644 --> 25:06.073
I'll take my chances.

25:07.241 --> 25:09.175
Will you?

25:11.751 --> 25:13.146
Yes.

25:15.150 --> 25:17.084
Wait for my signal.

25:26.293 --> 25:28.161
"There's a strange land yonder,

25:28.196 --> 25:33.067
a land of witchcraft
and beautiful things,

25:33.102 --> 25:36.235
a land of brave people."

25:46.082 --> 25:47.818
-I got this, Daddy.
-Hmm?

25:48.689 --> 25:50.854
"What is the good of..."

25:51.989 --> 25:55.386
"What is the good of talking?

25:55.421 --> 25:58.323
It grows dark.

25:58.358 --> 26:02.129
Those who live to see will see.

26:02.164 --> 26:05.770
'You need not fear me,
Macumazahn,'

26:05.805 --> 26:08.773
he said, interpreting my look."

26:12.009 --> 26:13.338
Mr. Aaron!

26:16.882 --> 26:20.279
"I dig no holes
for you to fall in,

26:20.314 --> 26:21.687
I make no plots."

26:21.722 --> 26:23.084
You're crazy!

26:23.119 --> 26:25.251
-What you want, boy?
-I caught a rabbit.

26:25.519 --> 26:28.892
Oh.
Well...show me.

26:31.798 --> 26:34.293
-"I-If we..."

26:37.298 --> 26:41.201
"If ever we are..."

26:41.236 --> 26:43.841
Get inside.
Keep reading.

26:54.722 --> 26:56.821
-No!

26:58.858 --> 27:00.187
Go! Go!

27:00.222 --> 27:02.024
Go! Run!

27:02.059 --> 27:04.092
Go! Run! Go!

27:04.127 --> 27:05.456
Don't stop!
Don't stop!

27:05.491 --> 27:06.897
Go!

27:06.932 --> 27:08.800
-Go! Go!

27:08.835 --> 27:10.065
Run!

27:10.100 --> 27:13.167
Run! Go!
Run!

27:13.202 --> 27:15.070
Go!

27:28.085 --> 27:30.118
Mr. Paul!

27:30.153 --> 27:32.252
I got him, Mr. Paul!

27:45.399 --> 27:48.136
Mr. Paul!

27:48.171 --> 27:50.171
Mr. Paul, I got him!

27:50.206 --> 27:53.108
I got him!
I got him!

27:53.143 --> 27:55.880
Mr. Paul.
Mr. Paul!

27:55.915 --> 27:59.246
I got him!
I got him! I got him!

28:04.121 --> 28:05.989
I think he's gone.

28:08.422 --> 28:11.324
All I ever tried to do...

28:11.359 --> 28:15.130
was protect you.

28:15.165 --> 28:17.396
Now, you go look.

28:18.399 --> 28:20.267
You go look...

28:20.302 --> 28:26.471
and you see
what betrayal looks like.

28:26.506 --> 28:28.209
You go look!

28:48.099 --> 28:51.397
What do you say I have Moses
make you some new toys?

28:51.432 --> 28:53.806
I want to go home.

29:44.056 --> 29:47.090
Alice, I want you
to sit with us.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.931
Sit!

30:00.039 --> 30:02.138
Looks good.
Don't you think, Daniel?

30:10.247 --> 30:11.950
Mm.

30:11.985 --> 30:14.249
Alice is a good cook.

30:29.662 --> 30:32.234
Be a shame to lose her.

30:56.161 --> 30:58.326
Stop!

30:58.361 --> 30:59.624
Shut your mouth!

30:59.659 --> 31:02.495
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

31:03.729 --> 31:06.301
Stop! Stop! Stop!

31:08.569 --> 31:11.471
Stop! Stop! Stop!

31:32.758 --> 31:34.362
Help me!

31:38.170 --> 31:39.433
Use the scold's bridle.

31:39.468 --> 31:40.401
No!

31:40.436 --> 31:42.469
No! No! No! No!

31:42.504 --> 31:44.075
No!

31:44.110 --> 31:45.978
You stop!

31:46.013 --> 31:47.111
Stop!

31:47.146 --> 31:50.180
What did I do to deserve this?!

31:50.215 --> 31:52.281
What did I do?!

31:55.187 --> 31:57.187
I really liked you, Alice.

31:57.222 --> 31:58.650
I really liked you!

32:02.161 --> 32:03.490
No!

34:30.441 --> 34:33.211
I want to move past this, Alice.

34:49.658 --> 34:52.395
The greatest gift
God gave to man

34:52.430 --> 34:54.364
was forgiveness.

37:24.615 --> 37:26.648
Aah!

38:03.687 --> 38:04.851
Miss?

38:04.886 --> 38:05.984
Miss?

38:06.019 --> 38:07.557
Miss, can you hear me?

38:07.592 --> 38:09.460
Miss? Miss, you got --

38:09.495 --> 38:10.758
Miss --

38:10.793 --> 38:11.957
Be cool, man!

38:11.992 --> 38:13.530
Miss?!

38:13.565 --> 38:15.763
Miss?

38:15.798 --> 38:17.732
Miss...

38:25.610 --> 38:27.478
<i>Don't give him no peace sign</i>

38:27.513 --> 38:29.711
<i>If you don't mean it</i>
<i>from your heart</i>

38:29.746 --> 38:31.944
<i>-United we can get over</i>
-United we can get over

38:31.979 --> 38:34.012
<i>-But yet were still apart</i>
-But yet were still apart

38:34.047 --> 38:38.555
<i>'Cause each man demands respect</i>
<i>and to get an equal share</i>

38:38.590 --> 38:40.084
<i>And until</i>
<i>you're givin' him that</i>

38:40.119 --> 38:42.691
<i>There'll be no peace</i>

38:42.726 --> 38:44.396
<i>Brother's gonna work it out</i>

38:44.431 --> 38:46.024
<i>Brother's gonna work it out</i>

38:46.059 --> 38:48.796
<i>Brother's gonna work it out</i>

38:48.831 --> 38:49.995
<i>Brother's gonna work it out</i>

38:50.030 --> 38:53.636
<i>Oh, we must all join hands</i>

38:53.671 --> 38:55.968
<i>We can march across</i>
<i>this land in peace...</i>

38:58.775 --> 39:00.643
Be cool!
Be cool.

39:00.678 --> 39:01.776
Listen.
Be cool.

39:04.748 --> 39:06.649
Be cool.
Ma'am...

39:06.684 --> 39:07.815
-Be cool.

39:07.850 --> 39:11.555
Be cool. Hey.
Hey, relax.

39:11.590 --> 39:13.150
Do you remember?
You fainted.

39:13.185 --> 39:16.626
I couldn't leave you out there.

39:16.661 --> 39:19.024
How did you get free?

39:19.059 --> 39:21.191
<i>When reality's all gone?</i>

39:21.226 --> 39:23.468
Free?

39:23.503 --> 39:25.569
What is this?!

39:25.604 --> 39:26.867
Hey, hey.
Hey!

39:26.902 --> 39:28.198
Don't -- Don't touch that.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.738
No, don't -- don't --

39:29.773 --> 39:32.609
Hold up, now.
Don't touch that door.

39:32.644 --> 39:35.876
You must've hit your head
real hard.

39:35.911 --> 39:37.449
<i>Eyes to the facts</i>

39:37.484 --> 39:39.517
<i>Of what's truly</i>
<i>holding you back</i>

39:39.552 --> 39:43.455
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

39:43.490 --> 39:47.217
Do you --
Do you know you in George?

39:47.252 --> 39:50.693
You do?

39:50.728 --> 39:53.960
Do you know it's 1973.

39:53.995 --> 39:57.469
<i>Oh, right on</i>

39:57.504 --> 39:59.933
As far as I'm concerned,
we went back 10 years

39:59.968 --> 40:02.540
with that jive ass
Nixon in office.

40:02.575 --> 40:04.938
You can go back?

40:04.973 --> 40:06.511
Oh, nah.

40:06.546 --> 40:08.480
Hell,
that would be slick.

40:15.687 --> 40:18.754
Air Force?

40:18.789 --> 40:22.186
Say,
that's an old Zippo.

40:22.221 --> 40:23.924
You know
what this is?

40:23.959 --> 40:26.157
Yeah, it's a lighter.
Let me see it.

40:26.192 --> 40:28.599
<i>Yet you stay locked</i>
<i>behind defeat</i>

40:28.634 --> 40:31.162
<i>Yet the key is</i>
<i>in your mind</i>

40:31.197 --> 40:32.570
Johnson?

40:32.605 --> 40:33.934
That your family?

40:33.969 --> 40:36.937
Uh, I have to get
out of this --

40:40.074 --> 40:42.811
Miss, there's napkins
in that glove compartment.

40:44.914 --> 40:46.782
There's napkins there.
Get the napkin--

40:56.563 --> 40:57.859
I'm sorry.

40:57.894 --> 40:59.223
I didn't m-mean to.

41:00.259 --> 41:01.863
It's okay.

41:03.702 --> 41:05.966
It's all right.
It's okay.

41:12.106 --> 41:15.008
I'm gonna let you
off up the ways.

41:15.043 --> 41:18.748
There's a hospital
right up there.

41:18.783 --> 41:20.651
They can
take care of you.

41:45.810 --> 41:47.612
Come on.

41:47.647 --> 41:49.746
I can't leave
this truck here.

41:52.850 --> 41:55.587
The people inside,
they're gonna help you.

42:12.067 --> 42:13.770
Excuse me.

42:13.805 --> 42:15.739
I picked up this woman
on the highway.

42:15.774 --> 42:17.708
-She fell.
-Okay.

42:17.743 --> 42:21.173
She might have amnesia. I
don't know.

42:21.208 --> 42:23.241
So, she must've hit her head
or something.

42:23.276 --> 42:26.277
-When she fainted?
-Yeah.

42:26.312 --> 42:28.884
Where is she?

42:28.919 --> 42:30.655
Shit.

42:33.957 --> 42:35.726
Hey.

42:35.761 --> 42:38.960
You can't be wondering off.
I'm trying to help you.

42:38.995 --> 42:41.732
Is she sick?

42:41.767 --> 42:43.063
Yeah.

42:43.098 --> 42:45.296
Probably.

42:45.331 --> 42:48.233
Is she free?

42:48.268 --> 42:50.675
Free from what?

42:50.710 --> 42:52.644
Her owner.

42:55.880 --> 42:58.947
Uh...

42:58.982 --> 43:01.378
W-We -- We need to go
to the front desk.

43:06.825 --> 43:09.958
Dr. Forest,
<i>dial 118 please.</i>

43:09.993 --> 43:13.830
<i>Dr. Forest,</i>
<i>please dial 1-1-8.</i>

43:33.346 --> 43:35.181
Rolling stone?

43:37.482 --> 43:39.350
You're saying
she has no recollection of time?

43:39.385 --> 43:40.758
That's right.

43:40.793 --> 43:42.221
And what's
your relationship to her?

43:42.256 --> 43:45.191
No relation.
I picked her up on the highway.

43:45.226 --> 43:47.160
Miss?

43:47.195 --> 43:48.799
You can go now, sir.

43:50.836 --> 43:52.165
That lady's
gonna help you.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.738
What's your name?

43:53.773 --> 43:57.335
Franklin.
What's yours?

43:57.370 --> 43:59.073
Alice.

43:59.108 --> 44:00.712
Okay, Alice.

44:02.474 --> 44:05.079
Miss?
I heard you had a fall.

44:05.114 --> 44:07.147
-Yes, ma'am.
-You have a headache?

44:07.182 --> 44:08.720
Any pain?

44:08.755 --> 44:10.315
Well, I'm gonna need you
to fill this out for me,

44:10.350 --> 44:12.383
and we'll be able to get you in
as soon as we can.

44:12.418 --> 44:15.254
I don't write.

44:15.289 --> 44:17.762
Oh, OK.

44:17.797 --> 44:19.423
I see.

44:19.458 --> 44:21.865
-What's your name?
-Alice?

44:21.900 --> 44:23.867
Last name?

44:23.902 --> 44:26.265
I don't have one.

44:26.300 --> 44:28.102
Current address?

44:28.137 --> 44:29.873
Address?

44:29.908 --> 44:32.106
Where do you live?

44:32.141 --> 44:33.910
I don't know yet.

44:41.249 --> 44:43.150
What does that mean?

44:43.185 --> 44:45.482
It means
you're going someplace nice.

45:14.117 --> 45:15.886
Alice?

45:18.220 --> 45:20.858
The Alice without
the last name.

45:29.363 --> 45:31.066
Southern Georgia Memorial

45:31.101 --> 45:32.331
Ma'am, hey.

45:32.366 --> 45:33.871
I was just here
a little while ago.

45:33.906 --> 45:36.236
-I remember.
-Alice, this is she okay?

45:36.271 --> 45:38.073
Has anybody --
Did anybody see her?

45:38.108 --> 45:39.470
If you're not of kin,

45:39.505 --> 45:41.340
I can't give you any information
on that patient.

45:41.375 --> 45:43.144
Sorry.

45:43.179 --> 45:46.246
Southern Georgia Memorial.

45:46.281 --> 45:47.885
Yeah.

45:56.962 --> 45:58.192
Alice.

45:58.227 --> 46:00.931
Alice,
did the doctor see you?

46:00.966 --> 46:02.559
They're helping me.

46:02.594 --> 46:04.462
Taking me
someplace nice.

46:04.497 --> 46:07.938
There ain't
no place nice.

46:07.973 --> 46:10.072
There's no place nice?

46:10.107 --> 46:11.876
Not where
they taking you.

46:13.572 --> 46:16.276
H-How do you know
there's no place nice?

46:16.311 --> 46:17.849
'Cause I know.

46:17.884 --> 46:19.378
Now, let's go.

46:19.413 --> 46:22.920
Come on. We got a break.
Come on.

46:24.891 --> 46:26.385
Frank...

46:26.420 --> 46:28.123
how do you know?

46:28.158 --> 46:29.861
'Cause I know.

46:32.096 --> 46:33.964
I just know, okay?

46:33.999 --> 46:35.394
Come on.

46:37.662 --> 46:41.598
How do I know
you're not the bad one?

46:41.633 --> 46:45.008
Look, I know what they do
to people in the sanatorium.

46:45.043 --> 46:47.373
It where they take you
and drill your brain out.

46:47.408 --> 46:51.014
Was you in one?

46:51.049 --> 46:53.412
No!

46:53.447 --> 46:55.920
Somebody close
to me was.

46:59.255 --> 47:02.487
And they died there.

47:02.522 --> 47:04.456
I'm sorry.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.264
My husband died.

47:12.631 --> 47:15.368
You ain't kill him,
did you?

47:26.546 --> 47:29.514
Maria! Mateo!
What's happenin'?

48:21.007 --> 48:23.205
Whose domestics
are those?

48:23.240 --> 48:25.977
Domestics?

48:26.012 --> 48:28.243
Those people work
for my brother.

48:28.278 --> 48:30.443
It was the family business.

48:30.478 --> 48:32.280
What the hell
have you been?

48:32.315 --> 48:35.085
You realize
you three hours late, right?

48:35.120 --> 48:38.352
Everything is not about you,
Frank.

48:38.387 --> 48:39.683
Who's that?

48:39.718 --> 48:41.289
Look, if you're trying
to get another one

48:41.324 --> 48:43.126
of your friends a job,
the answer's no.

48:43.161 --> 48:45.722
-Be cool, man.
-Never again.

48:45.757 --> 48:47.658
You understand?

48:47.693 --> 48:51.035
Tomorrow...
finish the reports

48:51.070 --> 48:52.663
and be on time, okay?

49:03.478 --> 49:04.708
Is that your brother?

49:04.743 --> 49:06.512
Yeah.

49:26.798 --> 49:29.535
You embarrassed by me?

49:29.570 --> 49:31.603
Nah.

49:31.638 --> 49:34.111
I'm embarrassed by him.

49:43.650 --> 49:46.057
It's not much.

49:46.092 --> 49:49.819
It was my mom's
old place.

49:49.854 --> 49:51.491
I'll get you something
to sleep in,

49:51.526 --> 49:54.164
and we can figure out
everything in the morning.

49:59.732 --> 50:01.501
You're hungry?

50:05.177 --> 50:07.375
Is that
your cold closet?

50:07.410 --> 50:09.179
My what?

50:12.184 --> 50:14.679
You like bologna?

50:16.122 --> 50:17.451
Bologna?

50:17.486 --> 50:18.716
Mm-hmm.

50:23.294 --> 50:25.063
Little mustard, too.

50:32.402 --> 50:34.270
It's good.

50:34.305 --> 50:36.239
Try it.

50:45.613 --> 50:48.350
It's salty.

50:48.385 --> 50:50.484
It's mustard.

50:52.191 --> 50:53.751
Mustard...

50:55.755 --> 50:58.228
You can eat
as much as you want.

51:02.168 --> 51:03.794
Do you have some milk?

51:03.829 --> 51:06.401
Blackberry juice okay?

51:08.471 --> 51:10.405
<i>We were told that only</i>
<i>white people were beautiful,</i>

51:10.440 --> 51:13.639
<i>only straight hair,</i>
<i>light eyes, light skin.</i>

51:13.674 --> 51:15.245
<i>Their own appearance</i>
<i>is beautiful.</i>

51:15.280 --> 51:16.675
<i>They're proud of it.</i>

51:16.710 --> 51:19.282
<i>And white people</i>
<i>are aware of it, too,</i>

51:19.317 --> 51:21.680
<i>because white people</i>
<i>now want natural wigs.</i>

51:21.715 --> 51:23.253
<i>They want wigs like this.</i>

51:23.288 --> 51:25.321
<i>Dig it?</i>
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

51:25.356 --> 51:26.619
-Yes.
<i>-All right.</i>

51:26.654 --> 51:28.225
<i>They say Superwoman.</i>

51:28.260 --> 51:29.688
<i>I think they get me</i>
<i>confused with --</i>

51:29.723 --> 51:31.426
<i>They think I've been</i>
<i>in "Cleopatra Jones"</i>

51:31.461 --> 51:32.625
<i>and some of these</i>
<i>super woman films...</i>

51:32.660 --> 51:33.923
That's Pam Grier.

51:33.958 --> 51:36.365
She the baddest
chick around.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.301
<i>I'm always</i>
<i>getting beaten up.</i>

51:38.336 --> 51:40.204
<i>It's a young woman who's able</i>
<i>to get out of a situation</i>

51:40.239 --> 51:41.634
<i>on her own,</i>
<i>use her instincts.</i>

51:41.669 --> 51:44.241
<i>She has to survive.</i>

51:44.276 --> 51:47.343
<i> Now back</i>
<i>to "Sanford and Son."</i>

51:47.378 --> 51:50.676
Are they small people?

51:50.711 --> 51:53.184
They're not inside.

51:53.219 --> 51:55.186
Yes? Oh, I'm sorry.

51:55.221 --> 51:56.946

1:05:22.621 --> 1:05:24.324
He was stealing
blackberries.

1:05:24.359 --> 1:05:28.064
Can you believe that?
We gave him that one shot.

1:05:28.099 --> 1:05:29.659
Damn immigrants.
Man, I'll tell you.

What you --
What you want me to tell him?

1:05:33.170 --> 1:05:35.533
Get rid of him.
And his wife, too.

-What did she do?
-Oh, come on, man.

1:05:37.306 --> 1:05:38.503
You know she had to know.

1:05:38.538 --> 1:05:39.768
I don't think
neither one of them

1:05:39.803 --> 1:05:40.769

to do with that.

1:05:40.804 --> 1:05:42.111
Oh, come on.

to make me nothing.

1:06:22.813 --> 1:06:25.550
Listen.

We got to figure out
what you have to do.

1:06:30.623 --> 1:06:34.394
Maybe some woman's home
or some place

1:06:34.429 --> 1:06:35.791
they can help you
get your memory back.

1:06:35.826 --> 1:06:37.397
I haven't lost
my memory.

1:06:37.432 --> 1:06:40.565
-You may think --
-I haven't lost my memory.

1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:44.701
I know exactly who I am
and where I came from.

1:06:44.736 --> 1:06:47.374
These books told me.

1:06:50.709 --> 1:06:53.611
Who are you then?

1:06:53.646 --> 1:06:55.580
I'm me.

1:06:55.615 --> 1:06:57.813
I know, Alice.
I know you Alice.

1:06:57.848 --> 1:07:00.090
But who are you?

1:07:00.125 --> 1:07:03.687
My whole life's
been a lie, Frank.

1:07:03.722 --> 1:07:05.590
Not just part.

1:07:05.625 --> 1:07:08.461
Not the kind of lies

1:07:08.496 --> 1:07:10.760
people tell themselves
to get by.

1:07:12.599 --> 1:07:15.204
The whole thing.

1:07:15.239 --> 1:07:17.173
So, who are you?

1:07:21.344 --> 1:07:23.773
I was a slave, Frank.

1:07:25.645 --> 1:07:27.447
Do you...

1:07:27.482 --> 1:07:28.811
Do you know what
you're saying?

1:07:28.846 --> 1:07:30.483
Do you?

1:07:30.518 --> 1:07:33.255
I know exactly
what I'm saying.

1:07:33.290 --> 1:07:36.390
No, do you? Do you really know
what you're saying right now?

1:07:38.658 --> 1:07:41.395
Listen.

1:07:41.430 --> 1:07:44.662
Alice, I need you
to tell me who you really are

1:07:44.697 --> 1:07:48.567
-or whoever it is --
-I just told you who I was.

1:07:48.602 --> 1:07:50.371
Alice...

1:07:53.706 --> 1:07:56.674
You need to get somebody
that can help you.

1:07:56.709 --> 1:08:00.150
Why can't you help me?

1:08:00.185 --> 1:08:02.416
Because I'm nobody.

1:08:34.714 --> 1:08:36.813
I'm meeting somebody
tomorrow.

1:08:38.685 --> 1:08:40.487
Somebody...

1:08:40.522 --> 1:08:41.917
I knew.

1:08:45.890 --> 1:08:48.693
That's -- That's good.

1:08:48.728 --> 1:08:50.266
That's...

1:08:50.301 --> 1:08:51.861
That's great.

1:08:55.438 --> 1:08:56.602
You...

1:08:56.637 --> 1:08:58.571
You want me to take you?

1:09:00.674 --> 1:09:02.443
I'd like that.

1:09:43.783 --> 1:09:46.355
<i>Through these tears</i>
<i>that I'm crying</i>

1:09:46.390 --> 1:09:50.326
<i>Reflects a hurt I can't control</i>

1:09:50.361 --> 1:09:52.394
<i>'Cause although you're gone</i>

1:09:52.429 --> 1:09:55.331
<i>I keep holding on</i>

1:09:55.366 --> 1:09:57.366
<i>To the happy times</i>

1:09:57.401 --> 1:10:00.831
<i>Ooh, when you were mine</i>

1:10:00.866 --> 1:10:03.372
<i>As I peer through the window</i>

1:10:03.407 --> 1:10:05.605
<i>Of lost time</i>

1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:07.838
<i>Looking over my yesterdays</i>

1:10:07.873 --> 1:10:13.008
<i>And all the love</i>
<i>I gave all in vain</i>

1:10:13.043 --> 1:10:14.746
<i>All the love</i>

1:10:14.781 --> 1:10:17.980
<i>All the love that I've wasted</i>

1:10:18.015 --> 1:10:19.619
<i>All the tears</i>

1:10:19.654 --> 1:10:22.886
<i>All the tears that I've tasted</i>

1:10:22.921 --> 1:10:30.333
<i>All in vain</i>

1:10:30.368 --> 1:10:32.731
<i>Through the hollow of my tears</i>

1:10:32.766 --> 1:10:35.470
<i>I see a dream that's lost</i>

1:10:35.505 --> 1:10:37.670
<i>From the hurt</i>

1:10:37.705 --> 1:10:40.035
<i>That you have caused</i>

1:10:40.070 --> 1:10:42.444
<i>Everywhere I turn</i>

1:10:42.479 --> 1:10:44.908
<i>Seems like everything I see</i>

1:10:44.943 --> 1:10:48.714
<i>Reflects the love</i>
<i>that used to be</i>

1:10:48.749 --> 1:10:50.947
<i>In you I put</i>

1:10:50.982 --> 1:10:53.719
<i>All my faith and trust</i>

1:10:53.754 --> 1:10:55.457
<i>Right before my eyes</i>

1:10:55.492 --> 1:10:57.426
It's<i> Rolling Stone.</i>

1:11:00.497 --> 1:11:01.991
How do I look?

1:11:02.026 --> 1:11:04.433
Like you.

1:11:04.468 --> 1:11:06.501
<i>Just a handful of promises</i>

1:11:06.536 --> 1:11:11.506
<i>Are all that's left</i>
<i>of loving you</i>

1:11:11.541 --> 1:11:13.409
<i>All the love</i>

1:11:13.444 --> 1:11:16.775
<i>All the love that I've wasted</i>

1:11:16.810 --> 1:11:18.414
<i>All the tears</i>

1:11:18.449 --> 1:11:21.648
<i>All the tears that I've tasted</i>

1:11:21.683 --> 1:11:25.685
<i>All in vain</i>

1:11:32.562 --> 1:11:35.464
You gonna be okay
going to see your friend?

1:11:35.499 --> 1:11:37.862
She was never my friend.

1:11:37.897 --> 1:11:39.930
She ain't your friend?

1:11:39.965 --> 1:11:41.998
That's right.

1:11:42.033 --> 1:11:43.406
How does that work?

1:11:43.441 --> 1:11:45.375
Just does.

1:11:47.445 --> 1:11:48.972
You need me to come with you?

1:11:49.007 --> 1:11:50.545
No.

1:12:01.459 --> 1:12:03.723
Sit anywhere you want.

1:12:14.835 --> 1:12:16.703
Just you?

1:12:16.738 --> 1:12:18.705
I'm waiting on somebody.

1:12:18.740 --> 1:12:20.135
Coffee?

1:12:42.896 --> 1:12:45.930
I-I'm looking for someone,
a woman.

1:12:45.965 --> 1:12:47.536
There's
a lot of women here.

1:12:47.571 --> 1:12:50.099
A Negro woman.

1:12:50.134 --> 1:12:53.201
-Take it easy.
-Take care.

1:12:53.236 --> 1:12:55.808
Alice.

1:12:55.843 --> 1:12:57.480
You look so different.

1:12:57.515 --> 1:12:59.075
You don't.

1:13:07.591 --> 1:13:10.460
Self-seating.

1:13:10.495 --> 1:13:12.088
Sweetie, turn that down.

1:13:13.564 --> 1:13:15.663
He's obsessed with that thing.

1:13:17.502 --> 1:13:20.998
I hid it in his suitcase
when he went to see Paul.

1:13:21.033 --> 1:13:22.604
Any coffee?

1:13:22.639 --> 1:13:24.474
I'm shocked he didn't find it.

1:13:24.509 --> 1:13:25.541
I heard it.

1:13:25.576 --> 1:13:27.070
I'm hungry, Alice.

1:13:27.105 --> 1:13:29.644
I'm not here to serve you.

1:13:31.208 --> 1:13:34.011
Why don't you go
check out that machine

1:13:34.046 --> 1:13:36.915
while mommy talks, okay?

1:13:36.950 --> 1:13:38.081
Alice --

1:13:38.116 --> 1:13:39.918
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

1:13:39.953 --> 1:13:42.525
You should never
have been afraid.

1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:45.792
We always wanted
to provide a safe place

1:13:45.827 --> 1:13:48.058
for our domestics.

1:13:48.093 --> 1:13:49.158
Yes.

1:13:49.193 --> 1:13:50.863
That includes discipline.

1:13:50.898 --> 1:13:53.701
But every home
needs structure.

1:13:53.736 --> 1:13:57.969
Life before people got confused
about their place,

1:13:58.004 --> 1:14:00.675
and it was
a lot less hard --

1:14:00.710 --> 1:14:03.942
I was never confused.

1:14:03.977 --> 1:14:05.614
I was lied to.

1:14:05.649 --> 1:14:06.945
You blame me?

1:14:06.980 --> 1:14:09.112
I always thought of you
as family.

1:14:09.147 --> 1:14:12.049
Stop with the lies,
Rachel.

1:14:12.084 --> 1:14:15.118
My family died
so yours could leave.

1:14:15.153 --> 1:14:16.922
I am not the devil,
Alice.

1:14:16.957 --> 1:14:19.859
No, the devil got to you
long before you left.

1:14:19.894 --> 1:14:21.828
-I am learning every --
-Enough.

1:14:21.863 --> 1:14:24.127
Why'd you ask me here
if I can't talk?

1:14:24.162 --> 1:14:26.701
Because this whole thing,

1:14:26.736 --> 1:14:29.165
me sitting
across from you,

1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:31.871
this ain't about<i> you.</i>

1:14:31.906 --> 1:14:33.906
This is about me

1:14:33.941 --> 1:14:35.237
seeing you

1:14:35.272 --> 1:14:39.043
for exactly what you are.

1:14:39.078 --> 1:14:42.981
Outside of that backwards world
I was born into to believe

1:14:43.016 --> 1:14:45.654
-you were actually somebody.
-Alice --

1:14:45.689 --> 1:14:49.185
I thought if I could see you
out in the open,

1:14:49.220 --> 1:14:51.726
It might stop me
from thinking about hunting down

1:14:51.761 --> 1:14:54.124
and doing something to make sure
you never forget my name.

1:14:54.159 --> 1:14:56.159
-Watch it, Alice.
-But Daniel

1:14:56.194 --> 1:14:58.227
needs at least one parent.

1:14:58.262 --> 1:14:59.228
Alice!

1:14:59.263 --> 1:15:02.770
I'm not scared.

1:15:02.805 --> 1:15:04.838
And that should
scare you --

1:15:04.873 --> 1:15:06.708
-Alice!
-Shut the hell up!

1:15:06.743 --> 1:15:08.809
It's my turn now.

1:15:08.844 --> 1:15:11.108
You left us there to die.

1:15:11.143 --> 1:15:13.979
You watched us
get tormented.

1:15:14.014 --> 1:15:16.047
And you thought
I wanted to meet up with you

1:15:16.082 --> 1:15:19.149
just to hear you talk.

1:15:19.184 --> 1:15:21.657
I don't give a damn
about your life.

1:15:21.692 --> 1:15:23.285
Freedom...

1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:26.057
is something you will never
understand in a million years.

1:15:27.159 --> 1:15:29.159
I<i> am</i> freedom.

1:15:29.194 --> 1:15:30.831
Daniel! Daniel!

1:15:30.866 --> 1:15:32.833
-Alice.
-Frank?

1:15:32.868 --> 1:15:34.703
Daniel, come.
Come.

1:15:34.738 --> 1:15:36.166
-Y'all need to leave.
-Alice, wait. Wait, Alice.

1:15:36.201 --> 1:15:37.365
Hey, hey, hey.
You got a bill.

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.812
-What about Alice?
-Get in the car right now!

1:15:44.847 --> 1:15:48.244
Rachel!

1:15:48.279 --> 1:15:49.278
Don't...

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:54.151
You let them get away!
Go to hell!

1:15:55.385 --> 1:15:58.089
Alice...

1:16:01.864 --> 1:16:03.358
I have to go back.

1:16:03.393 --> 1:16:05.800
Nah, you can't go back.
What you talking about?

1:16:05.835 --> 1:16:07.329
You know what will happen
to you?

1:16:07.364 --> 1:16:10.772
Everybody that's ever
cared about me is still there.

1:16:12.072 --> 1:16:13.808
I got to get them out.

1:16:16.043 --> 1:16:18.406
I'm'a need some more books.

1:17:25.013 --> 1:17:27.112
<i>What would you do?</i>
<i>Kill all of them?</i>

1:17:27.147 --> 1:17:30.412
<i>Well, why not? Nothing</i>
<i>else seems to do any good.</i>

1:17:30.447 --> 1:17:33.756
<i>You know who they are.</i>
<i>Everybody knows who they are.</i>

1:17:33.791 --> 1:17:36.385
<i>And the law is in</i>
<i>for a piece of the action.</i>

1:17:38.191 --> 1:17:40.895
<i>So, you want to play</i>
<i>with knives?</i>

1:17:42.393 --> 1:17:47.902
<i>You want to spit on me and make</i>
<i>me crawl, white motherfucker?</i>

1:17:47.937 --> 1:17:50.366
<i>Well, you picked</i>
<i>the wrong player.</i>

1:17:50.401 --> 1:17:53.105
<i>It seems like I'm in a dream.</i>

1:17:53.140 --> 1:17:54.942
<i>And I'm still in this dream,</i>

1:17:54.977 --> 1:17:59.782
<i>and it wouldn't take much</i>
<i>for me to kill you now.</i>

1:17:59.817 --> 1:18:02.851
<i>Shit. Look.</i>
<i>I ain't gonna shoot you.</i>

1:18:02.886 --> 1:18:07.284
<i>I'm gonna piss on your grave</i>
<i>tomorrow.</i>

1:18:16.130 --> 1:18:18.031
What'd you think?

1:18:21.333 --> 1:18:23.036
She wasn't real.

1:18:23.071 --> 1:18:25.170
Was she?

1:18:27.042 --> 1:18:30.505
What she believed in,
what she stood for was.

1:18:30.540 --> 1:18:32.474
Right on.

1:18:35.413 --> 1:18:37.820
You said you was going back.

1:18:37.855 --> 1:18:39.789
I am.

1:18:43.025 --> 1:18:45.421
What's going on, Alice?

1:18:45.456 --> 1:18:48.358
I'm going back.
Tomorrow.

1:18:48.393 --> 1:18:51.031
You can't go back by yourself.

1:18:53.299 --> 1:18:55.871
-The police ain't gonna help --
-Police?

1:18:55.906 --> 1:18:57.939
Them folk that's supposed
to help people.

1:18:57.974 --> 1:19:00.909
Well, they help
some people sometimes.

1:19:00.944 --> 1:19:02.438
You can't help me?

1:19:04.915 --> 1:19:08.312
You still do what
your brother tells you.

1:19:08.347 --> 1:19:11.920
So you no different
than me.

1:19:11.955 --> 1:19:15.055
But you used to stand
for something --

1:19:15.090 --> 1:19:17.255
the marches, the sit-ins.

1:19:17.290 --> 1:19:19.796
I saw them
in your memory box.

1:19:21.030 --> 1:19:23.998
Frank.

1:19:24.033 --> 1:19:26.231
What happened to you?

1:19:26.266 --> 1:19:29.366
What happened...

1:19:29.401 --> 1:19:33.040
was I spent
a decade of my life

1:19:33.075 --> 1:19:36.439
trying to help the cause.

1:19:36.474 --> 1:19:38.111
and make a change
for the people.

1:19:38.146 --> 1:19:40.278
That's what
happened to me.

1:19:40.313 --> 1:19:42.247
You know what changed.

1:19:42.282 --> 1:19:45.085
My mother died,

1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:47.417
and I got older,

1:19:47.452 --> 1:19:49.485
and the leaders got killed,

1:19:49.520 --> 1:19:51.223
and everybody
just stopped trying.

1:19:51.258 --> 1:19:53.621
That's what happened.

1:19:53.656 --> 1:19:57.097
But you can
make a change.

1:19:57.132 --> 1:20:01.134
You can make a change now.

1:20:01.169 --> 1:20:04.566
Something that's bigger
than yourself.

1:20:04.601 --> 1:20:06.304
Like Coffy.

1:20:06.339 --> 1:20:08.471
Oh, Alice.

1:20:08.506 --> 1:20:10.473
Oh, no. Just --

1:20:10.508 --> 1:20:15.181
A Black man trying
to do something for hisself.

1:20:15.216 --> 1:20:18.184
Where is that gonna happen
in America?

1:20:18.219 --> 1:20:20.219
That's a death certificate.

1:20:20.254 --> 1:20:23.288
You understand me?

1:20:23.323 --> 1:20:26.324
I'm asking myself
to get killed doing that.

1:20:26.359 --> 1:20:28.194
That's what that is.

1:20:28.229 --> 1:20:31.461
Where is that gonna happen?
You tell me that.

1:20:31.496 --> 1:20:33.265
But you can do something.

1:20:36.237 --> 1:20:38.237
You ain't got
no birth certificate

1:20:38.272 --> 1:20:40.569
or no Social Security, no I.D.

1:20:40.604 --> 1:20:42.945
You -- You can do
what you want.

1:20:42.980 --> 1:20:45.442
I didn't expect you
to say yes,

1:20:45.477 --> 1:20:47.917
but just so you know,

1:20:47.952 --> 1:20:50.645
doing the right thing

1:20:50.680 --> 1:20:53.153
is never wrong.

1:20:56.422 --> 1:20:59.390
I'm wrong because
I can't help you.

1:21:01.064 --> 1:21:02.624
No.

1:21:02.659 --> 1:21:05.693
You're wrong...

1:21:05.728 --> 1:21:08.201
'cause you don't believe.

1:21:10.271 --> 1:21:12.040
Not any more.

1:21:17.212 --> 1:21:19.080
What's your plan?

1:21:28.388 --> 1:21:30.256
We might need these.

1:21:37.727 --> 1:21:40.563
You came out
right about here.

1:21:40.598 --> 1:21:43.269
That's the service road
right there.

1:21:43.304 --> 1:21:46.008
You want
to take the road?

1:21:46.043 --> 1:21:48.472
For what we want to do,
we better.

1:21:50.443 --> 1:21:53.114
Yeah, then everybody
can see the truth.

1:21:53.149 --> 1:21:55.512
What's public transit?

1:21:55.547 --> 1:21:57.349
It's a bus, Alice.

1:21:57.384 --> 1:22:00.352
It pick people up and
take them where they need to go.

1:22:02.554 --> 1:22:05.357
-You sure you want to do this?
-I'm sure.

1:22:07.295 --> 1:22:08.525
Well, tomorrow night,

1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:10.692
if you change your mind
at any time,

1:22:10.727 --> 1:22:12.364
they don't
make you weaker.

1:22:12.399 --> 1:22:15.631
We can figure out
how to get everybody out.

1:22:15.666 --> 1:22:17.435
Like what?

1:22:20.506 --> 1:22:24.409
Well, everything
don't work out as planned.

1:22:24.444 --> 1:22:29.150
I used to dream of breaking
my mom out of that hospital.

1:22:29.185 --> 1:22:31.020
Why didn't you?

1:22:31.055 --> 1:22:33.187
I didn't believe I could.

1:22:34.652 --> 1:22:35.992
Frank.

1:22:37.523 --> 1:22:39.391
I'm not backing out.

1:22:55.706 --> 1:22:57.541
Hello.

1:22:57.576 --> 1:22:58.509
<i> Alice.</i>

1:22:58.544 --> 1:23:00.148
Frank.

1:23:01.745 --> 1:23:03.118
Frank.

1:23:03.153 --> 1:23:05.120
I can't do it.
I can't.

1:23:05.155 --> 1:23:06.748
<i>I just --</i>
<i>I can't do it.</i>

1:23:06.783 --> 1:23:08.750
<i>And, Alice, I don't think</i>
<i>you should do it either.</i>

1:23:08.785 --> 1:23:10.059
<i>I really don't --</i>

1:23:11.128 --> 1:23:12.523
Alice?

1:24:00.540 --> 1:24:02.342
You all right?

1:24:05.710 --> 1:24:07.743
Nodding's not
an answer, Frank.

1:24:07.778 --> 1:24:09.382
You okay?

1:24:12.717 --> 1:24:15.124
Frank?

1:24:15.159 --> 1:24:17.687
Nodding is an answer,
Danny.

1:24:17.722 --> 1:24:19.590
Be cool.

1:24:19.625 --> 1:24:23.363
Nah. You be cool.

1:24:23.398 --> 1:24:26.168
I've been cool for a long time.

1:24:26.203 --> 1:24:27.664
What's this?

1:24:27.699 --> 1:24:31.206
What this is, is I'm telling you
to get out my face.

1:24:31.241 --> 1:24:34.209
I'm my own man.
I think for myself.

1:24:34.244 --> 1:24:37.212
And you know what
a motherfucking nod is.

1:24:58.499 --> 1:25:00.631
Hi.

1:25:00.666 --> 1:25:03.172
Hello.

1:25:17.947 --> 1:25:19.386
Get in.

1:25:23.722 --> 1:25:25.590
It's better than the bus.

1:25:47.251 --> 1:25:50.285
10-8, there's a wildfire
on the I-55 highway.

1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:52.221
<i> Copy that.</i>
<i>What's your 20?</i>

1:25:52.256 --> 1:25:55.554
A service road right off
the Hitchcocks exit, 34A.

1:25:55.589 --> 1:25:57.424
<i>Fire truck en route.</i>

1:26:02.827 --> 1:26:04.695
Thought I knew better.

1:26:09.273 --> 1:26:10.833
I'm proud of you.

1:26:14.036 --> 1:26:16.938
Your mama...

1:26:16.973 --> 1:26:19.281
would be proud of you.

1:27:02.821 --> 1:27:04.018
Hurry your asses up!

1:27:08.024 --> 1:27:10.431
Hurry your asses up!

1:27:12.699 --> 1:27:15.832
All right!
Gather up!

1:27:30.816 --> 1:27:32.915
Get everyone
behind the house!

1:28:20.998 --> 1:28:23.900
Alice?

1:28:23.935 --> 1:28:25.671
Who'd you think
it was gonna be?

1:28:30.942 --> 1:28:32.810
You ain't gonna
win this fight.

1:28:32.845 --> 1:28:34.944
Get your ass back.

1:28:36.915 --> 1:28:39.553
You're not gonna
leave here again.

1:28:39.588 --> 1:28:41.687
At least not in one piece.

1:28:42.789 --> 1:28:44.888
Get inside.

1:28:52.535 --> 1:28:55.602
Sit.

1:28:55.637 --> 1:28:57.670
On the bed.

1:29:01.445 --> 1:29:02.939
What do you want, Alice?

1:29:02.974 --> 1:29:05.106
I want...

1:29:05.141 --> 1:29:07.713
everyone to see the truth.

1:29:07.748 --> 1:29:09.649
Well, all they're gonna see
is fire,

1:29:09.684 --> 1:29:11.013
and thanks to you,
they're gonna work

1:29:11.048 --> 1:29:13.785
through the night,
putting it out.

1:29:13.820 --> 1:29:15.424
No.

1:29:18.220 --> 1:29:23.025
No, they're not.

1:29:23.060 --> 1:29:26.127
My family's done working
for you.

1:29:26.162 --> 1:29:27.766
It's over.

1:29:29.605 --> 1:29:32.606
Everything you hid from us,

1:29:32.641 --> 1:29:35.576
all the lies you told

1:29:35.611 --> 1:29:40.548
to make yourself
feel important...

1:29:40.583 --> 1:29:45.685
it's all coming down
right before your eyes.

1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:53.693
Some things...

1:29:53.728 --> 1:29:55.827
you can't hide forever.

1:29:58.062 --> 1:30:00.832
I'm smarter than you.

1:30:00.867 --> 1:30:03.934
I'm better than you.

1:30:03.969 --> 1:30:07.102
And I know
that scares you.

1:30:11.009 --> 1:30:14.780
How does it feel?

1:30:14.815 --> 1:30:18.586
I gave you all
a meaningful life!

1:30:18.621 --> 1:30:20.819
Meaningful.

1:30:20.854 --> 1:30:23.591
This tradition was born
long before you.

1:30:25.661 --> 1:30:28.024
Alice, you j--

1:30:28.059 --> 1:30:30.059
You don't make sense.

1:30:32.833 --> 1:30:36.230
I never told anyone
that they had to stay.

1:30:54.250 --> 1:30:58.252
I just never told them
that they could go.

1:31:20.980 --> 1:31:22.144
What are you gonna do?

1:31:22.179 --> 1:31:24.586
Hmm?

1:31:24.621 --> 1:31:27.622
You gonna kill me?

1:31:27.657 --> 1:31:28.953
I'm gonna make sure

1:31:28.988 --> 1:31:33.188
your last few breaths
feel like hell.

1:31:33.223 --> 1:31:34.893
Well, Hell, Alice...

1:31:34.928 --> 1:31:36.730
-Is where you're going!
-...is where you're going!

1:31:36.765 --> 1:31:38.798
<i>Oh, oh</i>

1:31:38.833 --> 1:31:41.735
<i>You better think</i>

1:31:41.770 --> 1:31:44.232
<i>Think</i>

1:31:48.238 --> 1:31:52.009
<i>That's the thing</i>
<i>I never will forget</i>

1:31:52.044 --> 1:31:55.749
<i>Now baby, I got a life to live</i>
<i>and a whole lotta lovin'</i>

1:31:56.818 --> 1:31:58.851
<i>That I want to give you</i>

1:31:58.886 --> 1:32:00.952
<i>Yeah</i>

1:32:00.987 --> 1:32:05.693
<i>But before I give it up,</i>
<i>I got to think, think</i>

1:32:05.728 --> 1:32:09.290
Do you know Alice?

1:32:09.325 --> 1:32:10.929
Yeah. I know Alice.

1:32:14.066 --> 1:32:16.099
<i>I don't need no heartache</i>

1:32:16.134 --> 1:32:18.002
<i>-I can't stand no misery</i>

1:32:18.037 --> 1:32:20.609
<i>Let me think</i>

1:32:20.644 --> 1:32:21.973
<i>Think</i>

1:32:30.049 --> 1:32:32.951
<i>All right</i>

1:32:32.986 --> 1:32:34.183
<i>Hey!</i>

1:32:34.218 --> 1:32:36.086
Alice!

1:32:36.121 --> 1:32:38.693
Ow!

1:32:41.764 --> 1:32:43.258
<i>Don't say it's easy,</i>
<i>know it can be rough</i>

1:32:43.293 --> 1:32:44.930
<i>Don't</i>

1:32:46.769 --> 1:32:49.902
<i>Just plain living,</i>
<i>sometimes it's kinda tough</i>

1:32:49.937 --> 1:32:51.937
Oh, no! No!

1:32:54.040 --> 1:32:57.305
<i>You bad</i>

1:32:57.340 --> 1:33:01.782
<i>You bad, you bad</i>

1:33:01.817 --> 1:33:03.850
I'm sorry!

1:33:03.885 --> 1:33:04.983
What are you doing?!

1:33:05.018 --> 1:33:06.886
What are you doing?!

1:33:06.921 --> 1:33:08.250
I'm sorry!

1:33:10.188 --> 1:33:11.891
<i>You bad</i>

1:33:11.926 --> 1:33:13.794
I'm sorry.

1:33:13.829 --> 1:33:17.765
<i>You bad, you bad</i>

1:33:19.230 --> 1:33:21.098
<i>You bad, you bad</i>

1:33:21.133 --> 1:33:23.705
I'm sorry.

1:33:23.740 --> 1:33:25.399
<i>You bad, you bad</i>

1:33:58.434 --> 1:34:02.007
<i>It take two to make</i>
<i>a thing go right</i>

1:34:12.052 --> 1:34:15.152
I can't believe you made it out.

1:34:15.187 --> 1:34:18.254
I can't believe<i> we</i> made it out.

1:34:23.063 --> 1:34:24.766
<i>All right</i>

1:34:28.068 --> 1:34:30.871
Excuse me, ma'am.
Let me get the name.

1:34:32.809 --> 1:34:34.270
<i>You bad, you bad</i>

1:34:34.305 --> 1:34:35.909
I'm Alice.

1:34:35.944 --> 1:34:37.207
<i>She bad, ain't she?</i>

1:34:37.242 --> 1:34:38.780
<i>You bad, you bad</i>

1:34:38.815 --> 1:34:42.751
<i>If it's not in your vision</i>

1:34:42.786 --> 1:34:47.217
<i>Don't make no decision</i>

1:34:47.252 --> 1:34:50.319
<i>All right</i>

1:34:50.354 --> 1:34:52.222
<i>Hey!</i>

1:34:52.257 --> 1:34:54.290
<i>Come on, baby</i>

1:34:54.325 --> 1:34:59.130
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

1:34:59.165 --> 1:35:03.431
<i>Don't say it's easy</i>

1:35:03.466 --> 1:35:08.172
<i>Just plain living,</i>
<i>sometimes it's kinda tough</i>

1:35:11.177 --> 1:35:13.474
<i>You bad, you bad</i>

1:35:13.509 --> 1:35:14.783
<i>She bad, ain't she?</i>

1:35:14.818 --> 1:35:17.016
<i>You bad, you bad</i>

1:35:17.051 --> 1:35:20.921
<i>If it's not in your vision</i>

1:35:20.956 --> 1:35:25.321
<i>Don't make no decision</i>

1:35:25.356 --> 1:35:28.291
<i>You bad, sister</i>

1:35:28.326 --> 1:35:30.491
<i>Hey, yeah</i>

1:35:30.526 --> 1:35:33.494
<i>All right</i>

1:35:35.465 --> 1:35:37.399
<i>All right</i>

1:35:37.434 --> 1:35:41.876
<i>So I'm laying the cards</i>
<i>on the table</i>

1:35:41.911 --> 1:35:44.109
<i>When it comes</i>
<i>to taking care of me</i>

1:35:44.144 --> 1:35:46.177
<i>I know I'm able</i>

1:35:46.212 --> 1:35:50.313
<i>You may not call it true</i>

1:35:50.348 --> 1:35:54.350
<i>But I won't do nothing</i>
<i>that you won't do</i>

1:35:54.385 --> 1:35:57.826
<i>Said I won't do nothing</i>
<i>that you won't do</i>

1:35:57.861 --> 1:36:00.455
<i>So think</i>

1:36:00.490 --> 1:36:02.325
<i>About the good things</i>

1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:04.162
<i>Come on and think</i>

1:36:43.071 --> 1:36:47.975
<i>I'm happy just to have</i>
<i>this moment</i>

1:36:48.010 --> 1:36:52.507
<i>I love the way</i>
<i>my life's unfolding</i>

1:36:52.542 --> 1:36:56.984
<i>I know exactly</i>
<i>where I'm going</i>

1:36:57.019 --> 1:36:59.448
<i>Take a look around</i>

1:36:59.483 --> 1:37:02.649
<i>Things are changing now</i>

1:37:02.684 --> 1:37:07.522
<i>I turned the page</i>
<i>and wrote my story</i>

1:37:07.557 --> 1:37:12.527
<i>It begins with faith,</i>
<i>but don't you worry</i>

1:37:12.562 --> 1:37:17.037
<i>I only want</i>
<i>what God has for me</i>

1:37:17.072 --> 1:37:19.303
<i>Take a look around</i>

1:37:19.338 --> 1:37:22.174
<i>I'm stronger now</i>

1:37:22.209 --> 1:37:24.473
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:37:24.508 --> 1:37:27.080
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:37:27.115 --> 1:37:29.478
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:37:29.513 --> 1:37:32.085
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:34.450
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:37:34.485 --> 1:37:37.123
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:37:37.158 --> 1:37:39.521
<i>We are gonna be just fine</i>

1:37:39.556 --> 1:37:42.260
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:37:42.295 --> 1:37:47.265
<i>From empty to overflowing</i>

1:37:47.300 --> 1:37:52.270
<i>Yeah, that's the type of cup</i>
<i>I'm holdin'</i>

1:37:52.305 --> 1:37:56.604
<i>It's the kind a girl</i>
<i>can't help but notice</i>

1:37:56.639 --> 1:37:58.947
<i>The sun is out</i>

1:37:58.982 --> 1:38:02.214
<i>Things are clearer now</i>

1:38:02.249 --> 1:38:07.153
<i>Every path you take,</i>
<i>it feels so hard at times</i>

1:38:07.188 --> 1:38:12.125
<i>Got to get lost</i>
<i>to find who you are at times</i>

1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:13.423
<i>It brought me joy</i>

1:38:13.458 --> 1:38:16.360
<i>It brought me patience</i>

1:38:16.395 --> 1:38:18.692
<i>It's a better day</i>

1:38:18.727 --> 1:38:21.563
<i>And say, say</i>

1:38:21.598 --> 1:38:24.071
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:38:24.106 --> 1:38:26.502
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:38:26.537 --> 1:38:29.076
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:38:29.111 --> 1:38:31.507
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:38:31.542 --> 1:38:34.114
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:38:34.149 --> 1:38:36.479
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:38:36.514 --> 1:38:39.053
<i>We are gonna be just fine</i>

1:38:39.088 --> 1:38:41.055
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:38:41.090 --> 1:38:43.354
<i>In my heart</i>

1:38:43.389 --> 1:38:45.719
<i>In my mind</i>

1:38:45.754 --> 1:38:50.394
<i>I believe</i>

1:38:50.796 --> 1:38:53.265
<i>Through the rain</i>

1:38:53.300 --> 1:38:55.696
<i>I'll be fine</i>

1:38:55.731 --> 1:39:01.207
<i>I believe, yeah</i>

1:39:01.242 --> 1:39:03.704
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:39:03.739 --> 1:39:06.212
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:39:06.247 --> 1:39:08.610
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:39:08.645 --> 1:39:11.217
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:39:11.252 --> 1:39:13.615
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:39:13.650 --> 1:39:16.156
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:39:16.191 --> 1:39:18.587
<i>We are gonna be just fine</i>

1:39:18.622 --> 1:39:22.096
<i>We are gonna be all right</i>

1:39:22.131 --> 1:39:26.595
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,</i>
<i>ah, ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

1:39:32.735 --> 1:39:36.539
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

1:39:36.574 --> 1:39:39.212
<i>Mm, mm, mm</i>
