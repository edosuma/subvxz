separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.707 --> 00:08.577

who investigate crime

00:08.642 --> 00:11.382
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

So, now I take you along,
and you get...

00:22.556 --> 00:23.896
You actually like these people?
Yeah.

00:23.957 --> 00:24.987
I grew up with those guys.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.298
You got bigger.
None of you grew up.

I know how to handle this.

00:39.740 --> 00:40.840
Hey, pal.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.418
Oh, jeez.

this in a puddle on the backseat.

How about the slug?

I'm gonna hold onto this.

01:05.599 --> 01:06.739
So, how long has he been dead?

01:06.800 --> 01:08.970
Well, the way the blood's
settled, about four hours, tops.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.516
Around midnight.

You all right?

Yeah. Sandy's
a little shook up. Yeah.

01:30.624 --> 01:34.134
When you came out, did you see anybody
at all out here on the street?

01:34.328 --> 01:35.428
No, no one.

01:35.495 --> 01:37.625
All right, now, did either
one of you touch that cab?

01:37.698 --> 01:40.798
I knocked on the window.
Tommy opened the front door.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.397
Okay, if you think of anything.

on a trip.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.604
Do you ever catch
any of these robbers?

Well, that would depend on the
circumstances of the robbery.

03:46.426 --> 03:48.056
What do you mean?

03:48.128 --> 03:49.328
Well, for instance,

the dispatcher said your husband
quit work at 10:00 p.m.

03:52.632 --> 03:53.632
So?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.440
Well, we were wondering,
do you have any idea

03:55.502 --> 03:57.712
what he might have been
doing at midnight?

03:57.771 --> 04:00.121
Same thing he was always doing.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.980
He was working.

04:02.109 --> 04:05.389
Radio cars aren't supposed
to pick up street fares.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.019
But they do, huh?

I opened a restaurant

We needed every dime
he could bring in.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.168
Okay.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.040
Now, could you describe
any valuables he had with him?

04:26.099 --> 04:28.579
There's a chance that
they'll turn up.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.342

04:43.483 --> 04:46.123

who went out last night.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.426
Yeah, if it was a cab robbery.

04:48.488 --> 04:51.698
Well, you heard her. They needed the money.
He was working.

04:52.359 --> 04:55.139
He was driving the company car
around for a couple of hours

04:55.195 --> 04:56.195
late at night.

04:56.263 --> 05:00.683
What he was doing and what he told the
wife are not necessarily the same thing.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.852
He told me he was going home.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.684
His wife said he was
picking up fares.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.689
The drill sergeant?
She says a lot of things.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.352
She called here yesterday during
Johnson's break and bit his head off.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.959
Maybe he didn't
want to go home.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.495
So, the Johnsons
weren't getting along?

05:17.551 --> 05:20.861
Money problems. The guy was always
nosing around for an advance.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.804
Okay, so, to make ends meet, he picks up a
couple of fares after his shift is over.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.468

Johnson was doing last night.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.282
I wanted to help the guy out.

05:40.340 --> 05:44.380
I told him, "Keep the car. Earn what you can.
It's your license."

05:44.444 --> 05:45.684
Isn't that a little dangerous?

05:45.745 --> 05:47.045
BRYANT: Danny knew the risks.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.424
Two months ago,
some punk pulls a gun on him,

05:49.482 --> 05:51.662

05:51.718 --> 05:54.718
and he gets off with two years
for attempted robbery.

Well, what about
the ones on top?

06:07.567 --> 06:11.107
Funny. I got some partials.
Bring me somebody's fingers.

Right.

06:17.143 --> 06:19.383
What are the keys
doing in his pocket?

06:20.146 --> 06:24.486
If a robber pulls you over, even if you kill
the engine, the keys stay in the ignition.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.051
Well, he must have been parked,
and he was getting out.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.863
There's nothing to get out on
the block for, except Noonan's.

06:29.923 --> 06:33.343
A black guy'd have to be awful thirsty
to walk into that bar at midnight.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.927
Unless he's meeting somebody.

06:36.663 --> 06:40.343
I already told you yesterday, I didn't
have a black customer last night

06:40.400 --> 06:43.010
or the night before that
or the night before that.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.613
Yeah, well, we were just wondering if
maybe somebody here was waiting for him.

06:46.673 --> 06:49.853
I pour drinks and listen to gripes.
I don't get their social calendars.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.190

Irish, neat.

06:52.345 --> 06:55.185
Okay, about midnight,
was anybody sitting alone

06:55.248 --> 06:56.988
like they were waiting
for somebody to come in?

06:57.050 --> 07:00.090
Sorry.
Yeah. Steve what's-his-name.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.933
When he come out of the can, asked if
anybody was looking for him. You know.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.504
BRISCOE: Yeah.
Steve what is his name?

07:06.559 --> 07:08.509
You know how many Steves
we get in here?

07:09.696 --> 07:11.566
You wanna give it a shot?

07:11.631 --> 07:14.771
I don't know. I might've been
thinking of somebody else.

07:17.837 --> 07:20.937
Okay, well, I guess we'll
camp out here a few nights.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.847
Let's interrogate anybody
coming through the door.

07:22.909 --> 07:25.549
I wouldn't expect
much of a cash flow.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.795

07:34.154 --> 07:36.504
but you didn't hear it from me.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.927
Buddy of mine
was a no-show.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.107
Took a dump, then I left.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.170
Nice detail.

07:45.231 --> 07:48.181
So that puts you outside
Noonan's around midnight, right?

07:49.302 --> 07:50.472
I wasn't wearing a watch.

07:50.537 --> 07:51.537
(DOOR OPENING)

07:52.339 --> 07:54.289
Mr. Breck here's
a lonely guy.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.951
He goes to bars and hangs
out in the men's room.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.691
He's about to become
less lonely.

07:59.746 --> 08:03.276
Your fingerprint matches
a partial on the cabby's door.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.563
The front driver's side.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.556
Partial?

08:08.355 --> 08:10.095
So, that could be
a lot of guys.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.260
Yeah, but you're the one with a
record for assault and loan sharking,

08:13.326 --> 08:15.426
so it might as well be you.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.277
I was waiting for Johnson.
He doesn't show.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.724
So, I go outside.
There's his cab.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.821
I open the door to check.
He's already dead.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.051
How much was he
into you for, Mr. Breck?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.826
You think I'm gonna whack a guy, so
I meet him at my neighborhood bar?

08:38.885 --> 08:41.525
Maybe he promised to pay you and
then showed up empty-handed.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.328
Yeah, so I kill him?
That'll make him pay.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.890
How much, Mr. Breck?

08:44.958 --> 08:48.338
Fifteen grand,
but I never saw any of it.

You should see his socks.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.564
His credit card lit up my machine.
Past due, over limit and stolen.

09:15.755 --> 09:16.925
What did this guy do?

09:16.990 --> 09:18.300
We'll let you know. Thanks.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.768
I just wanted
a pair of wingtips.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.761
Where'd you get
the credit card, Ronald?

09:23.830 --> 09:26.830
It's mine.
Sorry it's overdue.

09:27.634 --> 09:31.744
No, Ronald, the man whose name is on
that card was murdered last night.

09:36.676 --> 09:40.386

threw it out.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.727
It's mine.
What man threw it out?

09:45.452 --> 09:48.062
The big man.
In the dumpster.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.731
Ronald, now, think hard, what
did the big man look like?

09:54.360 --> 09:58.500
He had a snake. I saw it
when he took off his jacket.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.405
He was carrying a snake?

10:00.533 --> 10:02.103
On his T-shirt.

10:03.503 --> 10:04.613
It said snake.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.171
It said a snake,
or it was a snake?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.720
I don't know.

10:08.975 --> 10:12.075
Ronald, can you take us
where this dumpster is?

10:16.316 --> 10:20.726
Last time we sifted a dumpster, the
investigating officer got in here himself.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.587
That's fascinating. I think
you missed a spot over there.

10:28.461 --> 10:32.201

wanna take a bite out of that?

Extra large, green plaid

10:44.010 --> 10:46.050
with lots of dried brown.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.947
The blood on the jacket is
a 96% match with Johnson's.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.727
Figures. Any hints
about the jacket's owner?

10:54.454 --> 10:57.094
The trick was sorting through
the crap from the dumpster.

10:57.190 --> 11:01.370
Most of that was on the surface, but
ingrained in the fibers, grease.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.068
So, he spills his
french fries when he eats.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.174

and something else.

morning and says he's not coming in, ever.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.844
Did he happen to mention
if he hit the lotto?

11:39.899 --> 11:41.569
Maybe he's looking
for better health benefits.

11:41.634 --> 11:42.914
He didn't share it with me.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.779
Well, why don't you share
his home address with us?

go out about an hour ago.

as clean as his jacket.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.065
It's supposed to be
diamonds in the ice tray.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.553
And what have you got,
about $15,000?

12:20.740 --> 12:21.840
Yeah.

12:24.777 --> 12:28.687
If I'm not mistaken, Ben Franklin's
face is covered with blood.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.691
(LIGHT MUSIC PLAYING)

12:39.592 --> 12:41.592
The personal touch.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.998
It's not easy,
all things considered.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.413
Mrs. Johnson,
you recognize this man?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.143
His name is Charles Kovac.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.222
We think he killed
your husband.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.849
So, then, you got him?

12:57.911 --> 13:00.861
No, but we're looking for him, and
we're watching his apartment.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.363
We thought maybe
you could help us.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.325
Your husband ever mention him?

13:05.685 --> 13:08.755
You think Danny knew
the robber who killed him?

13:08.855 --> 13:10.955
That doesn't make any sense.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.997
Actually, what doesn't
make any sense

13:13.059 --> 13:16.299
is that your husband had $15,000
on him when he was killed.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.466
$15,000?

13:19.832 --> 13:22.402
He was carrying it
to pay off a loan shark.

13:23.936 --> 13:25.416
This has to be a mistake.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.011
Forgive me, Mrs. Johnson, but
I look around at this place,

13:28.074 --> 13:30.424
it must've been
pretty expensive to open.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.476
Maybe your husband borrowed
the money for you?

13:34.113 --> 13:36.863
I saved eight years
for this place.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.260
I've got budget
to work through till 1999.

13:40.319 --> 13:44.319
Until my name gets around, I'm lucky if
I clear a few hundred dollars a week.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.060
So, maybe you needed
a little help.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.655
You think a loan shark would
wait five years for his money?

13:48.728 --> 13:50.968
Well, you were married
to him, Mrs. Johnson.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.870
I mean, you didn't know
what was going on?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.237
No.

13:55.401 --> 13:56.401
(BRISCOE SIGHING)

13:56.469 --> 14:00.139
Did your husband have any friends who
might've known what he was up to?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.107
Danny had a lot of friends.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.220
Yeah, I'm gonna miss the guy.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.785
You couldn't be unhappy
when Danny was in the room.

14:13.052 --> 14:16.232
What was it, his sense of
humor or his winning smile?

14:16.289 --> 14:17.999
Danny was generous.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.827
You ever hear how
he got his Purple Heart?

14:21.060 --> 14:22.330
He's over in Kuwait

14:22.395 --> 14:26.235
with a truck of Chinese-smuggled
beer that he's bought for $1,000.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.113
He's got it sold to an
officer's mess for $2,000.

14:29.802 --> 14:33.222
Meanwhile, I'm lying in a
hospital bed 10 miles away,

14:33.506 --> 14:36.676
so Danny detours
to drop off some freebies.

14:37.243 --> 14:41.493
This takes him through a minefield.
Boom! Shrapnel in the foot.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.048
Not much of
a business head, huh?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.050
Danny would've made it someday.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.929
Problem was, he was living
like he already had.

14:48.988 --> 14:53.198
One Saturday, when his wife was still
working at Contini's, Danny has the kid,

14:53.259 --> 14:55.209
and the kid wants
to go fishing.

14:55.261 --> 14:58.301
So, wife says take the two-hour
cruise off Sheepshead Bay.

14:58.965 --> 15:02.165
Not Danny.
Danny charters a boat.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.506
I caught six bluefish.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.817
He was
the Miller High Life guy.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.446
Never an empty glass when
Danny Johnson was in the bar.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.222
It doesn't take too many boat
charters and rounds for the house

15:15.281 --> 15:16.781
to run up some debt.

15:16.849 --> 15:20.419
You think Kovac was hanging around
and saw the goodies flowing?

15:20.653 --> 15:23.603
None of Johnson's friends
recognized the photo.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.427
Kovac's only priors
are small-time possession.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.533
Maybe there's a drug dealer
out there who connects them.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.737
You know,
as far as we can tell,

15:32.799 --> 15:36.539
the only thing that Johnson was
addicted to was a good time.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.209
Anybody turn up Kovac?

15:38.271 --> 15:39.311
Mmm-mmm.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.152
He must've spotted
our stakeout and run.

15:42.508 --> 15:46.288
Here, Kovac was arrested twice
last year at the same place.

15:46.412 --> 15:49.522
A drug alley off East 110th Street.
What?

15:51.784 --> 15:52.894
The guy lives in Chelsea.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.402
He can get a fix
a lot closer than East Harlem.

a home away from home.

next week.

Kovac killed Danny Johnson.

The new stiff.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.226

Well, he had
a lot of junkie friends.

kill each other all the time.

murder and Kovac:'s are related?

about our leg-breaker, Breck.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.217
Johnson's brains
are all over the car.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.386
You think that mook had to open
the door to see that he was dead?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.623
He was looking for his $15,000.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.318

Is this supposed to
mean something?

Yeah, he's the guy who stole Johnson's
cash right from under your nose.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.915
And we think maybe
that made you mad,

19:07.980 --> 19:09.460

and tracked him down,

when he was flush.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.241

19:20.359 --> 19:23.669
Johnson said he was getting
the money from his wife.

19:29.735 --> 19:33.575
I tied her corporate checking to a
non-collateralized credit line.

19:33.706 --> 19:37.876
She had a strong business plan, and
character still counts for something.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.477

you gave her,

No, actually, her husband came in.
Said they were redoing the electrical.

handed over $15,000?

signed by his wife.

later that day.

Mrs. Johnson tried
to withdraw $200.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.575
There's only $22
left in the account.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.992
She knew, all right.

20:48.848 --> 20:52.688
Johnson wipes out his wife's working capital.
She finds out.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.432
An hour later, she calls him
at work and rips his head off.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.368
And that leads you to murder?

20:57.423 --> 20:59.843
This does.
We pulled up some IUDs.

20:59.892 --> 21:03.312
Kovac called Mrs. Johnson three hours
before her husband was killed.

21:03.362 --> 21:06.142
If they weren't talking murder,
it's a hell of a coincidence.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.268
You think the wife told Kovac
where to find her husband?

21:09.635 --> 21:11.045
How did she know?

21:11.404 --> 21:13.884
Johnson's last fare
was a regular.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.319
Every Monday night, from the
bingo parlor to Lenox Avenue.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.286
Now, the wife might have
known about it.

21:19.345 --> 21:23.845
So, Kovac followed him from Lenox
Avenue to Noonan's Bar, and bang.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.186
Then what happened to Kovac?

21:26.252 --> 21:27.562
Maybe he tried
to shake her down

21:27.620 --> 21:29.790
after we took the money
out of the freezer.

want to leave a loose end.

Kovac was shot with a .22. Nothing
registered to the Johnsons.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.482
So, the whole thing
hinges on that phone call.

21:42.535 --> 21:46.915
You ever consider that Kovac could
have been calling Mr. Johnson?

21:48.507 --> 21:51.347
You better find out if he and
the wife ever crossed paths.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.750
Maybe he fixed
her leaky faucet.

21:54.113 --> 21:57.193

a leaky water heater,

21:57.249 --> 22:00.289

You lied to us about Kovac.
You lied about the $15,000.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.333
Now we found out you had
access to Contini's gun.

23:45.424 --> 23:50.204
Maybe this man met my husband at the
restaurant when he picked me up,

23:50.262 --> 23:52.712
and they got mixed up
in something together.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.245
You told us all your husband
did was work driving the cab.

23:55.301 --> 23:57.411
I didn't follow him around!

24:00.539 --> 24:02.539
I have to pick up my son.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.204
I'm telling you, she's got
ice water in her veins.

24:17.256 --> 24:20.356
Maybe she just knows we don't
have enough to arrest her.

24:20.426 --> 24:21.426
(BANGING ON DOOR)

24:24.029 --> 24:27.009
It's a positive match. The gun from
Contini's killed Charles Kovac.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.236
That ought to be enough.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.780
For Kovac.
What about her husband?

24:29.835 --> 24:31.575
Well, it's sort of
a boxed set, isn't it?

24:31.637 --> 24:34.377
She knew her husband stole her money.
She had contact with Kovac.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.650
We don't know what went on
between her and Kovac.

24:36.709 --> 24:40.559
Yeah, because the best witness
is dead because she killed him.

24:40.946 --> 24:43.186
We let her shoot her way
out of a murder charge,

24:43.249 --> 24:46.159
we're setting a pretty bad precedent.
Do it.

24:48.454 --> 24:49.804
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

24:52.525 --> 24:53.695
Mrs. Johnson.

24:53.759 --> 24:54.859
What now?

24:54.927 --> 24:57.127
This is Mrs. Lawson
from Children's Services.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.396
She'll take care of the boy.

24:58.464 --> 24:59.704
What?

24:59.798 --> 25:03.248
We'd just as soon not arrest
you in front of your son.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.014
Rickie, Mommy has to
go out tonight,

25:07.072 --> 25:09.642
so this lady, she's gonna
baby-sit for you, okay?

25:09.875 --> 25:10.975
Okay.

25:12.544 --> 25:13.924
It's okay.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.624
Denise Johnson,
you're under arrest

25:16.682 --> 25:19.132
for the murders of Daniel
Johnson and Charles Kovac.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.394
You have the right
to remain silent.

25:20.452 --> 25:23.092
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

25:23.155 --> 25:24.325
Do you understand that? You
have the right to an attorney.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.390
If you cannot afford...

25:27.826 --> 25:30.566
Two victims,
two distinct crimes,

25:30.629 --> 25:32.339
and you come up
with one suspect.

25:32.831 --> 25:35.841
Do you people get tunnel vision
from breathing the air down here?

25:35.901 --> 25:39.011
It doesn't take a genius to connect
your client to both these murders.

25:39.071 --> 25:42.781
Eight other people had access to
the gun that killed Charles Kovac.

25:42.908 --> 25:47.758
Five of them met Kovac while he was
repairing the sprinklers at Contini's.

25:47.813 --> 25:51.353
Only one of them has a husband in
Greenlawn, put there by Kovac.

25:51.417 --> 25:54.557
That's right.
He was put there by Kovac.

25:54.653 --> 25:57.963
Three hours after Kovac
talked to Mrs. Johnson.

25:58.023 --> 26:00.163
I never talked to that man.
My machine must have picked...

26:00.225 --> 26:02.205
That phone call
lasted 10 seconds.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.901
Enough time to hear
the greeting and hang up.

26:04.963 --> 26:06.103
Or...

26:07.399 --> 26:10.349
"Denise? Kovac.
Where and when?"

26:10.969 --> 26:12.969
"Noonan's Bar, midnight."

26:14.106 --> 26:15.206
Four seconds.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.554
ELLIOT: As long as
you're fantasizing,

26:16.608 --> 26:19.278
you wanna tell me again
why she killed Kovac?

26:19.344 --> 26:21.054
He wanted more money?

26:21.213 --> 26:22.693
He tried to blackmail her?

26:22.748 --> 26:23.848
I see.

26:24.116 --> 26:27.756
She had motive to kill Kovac because
she hired him to kill her husband,

26:27.820 --> 26:31.030
and you know she hired him
to kill her husband

26:31.089 --> 26:32.729
because she killed Kovac.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.970
You're driving in circles, and the
jury's going to be very dizzy.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.898
You might want to lend them
your adding machine.

26:41.967 --> 26:44.167
JACK: As long as we lay out
the whole package, Adam,

26:44.236 --> 26:46.266
her motives and means
are perfectly clear.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.818
Right. You're gonna
bring charts and diagrams

26:48.874 --> 26:51.084
and the dead junkie accomplice,

26:51.143 --> 26:54.963
while Elliot shows the jury
a hard-working black woman

26:55.113 --> 26:57.023
who's just become
a single mother.

26:57.082 --> 26:59.152
She really can't complain
about being a widow

26:59.218 --> 27:01.128
after murdering her husband.

27:01.687 --> 27:04.357
I'm sure the jury'll
appreciate your sense of humor

27:04.423 --> 27:05.563
while they're trying
to figure out

27:05.624 --> 27:09.134
why Mrs. Johnson
wanted her husband dead.

27:12.831 --> 27:15.941
Even when we were kids,
Danny was the smart one.

27:16.068 --> 27:19.978
I used to read to him at night,
till he started to correct me.

27:20.239 --> 27:23.709
But your brother's the one who ended
up behind the wheel of a cab.

27:23.842 --> 27:25.522
Anything else
might have required

27:25.577 --> 27:28.577
concentrating on one thing
for two weeks in a row.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.248
Danny didn't have
much follow-through.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.800
His wife seems
pretty disciplined.

27:33.919 --> 27:37.699
She wants what she wants. Up the
ladder, one rung at a time.

27:37.856 --> 27:40.496
And Danny didn't
fit with the program?

27:40.559 --> 27:42.469
Denise was the program.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.635
Danny should have got out
of there a long time ago.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.698
Why didn't she just
divorce him?

27:48.767 --> 27:52.937
When she was getting started, she needed
his signature for the lease documents.

27:53.138 --> 27:57.548
If she divorced him, she probably would
have to give him half the place.

27:58.310 --> 28:01.260
Now she doesn't have
that problem, does she?

28:02.080 --> 28:04.560
Look, Denise is
a businesswoman.

28:04.616 --> 28:08.256
She finds business solutions
for her problems, not murder.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.727
Her husband was a problem?

28:12.558 --> 28:15.268
The last time he was here,
we had to ask him to leave.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.397
Why?

28:18.964 --> 28:21.074
If you don't tell me,
someone else will.

28:23.702 --> 28:28.082
Danny sunk some money, Denise's
money, in a pyramid scheme.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.640
He was supposed to get rich quick
by selling distributorship.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.090
Danny lines up
half a dozen prospects,

28:34.146 --> 28:37.316
brings them and their wives
here to close the deal.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.992
Runs up a $1,500 tab.

28:40.052 --> 28:43.522
Pulls six bottles of ChÃ©teau
Margaux from the wine closet.

28:43.589 --> 28:45.429
$300, our cost.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.491
And his prospects
still didn't buy?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.399
They got too drunk to talk.

28:50.028 --> 28:52.798
We had a restaurant critic here
from The Times that night.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.505
Danny's party made
so much noise, she left.

28:59.738 --> 29:03.618
Mr. Contini,
when the New York Times critic

29:03.675 --> 29:06.985
walked out of her restaurant
because of her husband,

29:07.079 --> 29:09.579
did you see the defendant
shortly after that?

29:09.648 --> 29:11.358
Yes. The next day.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.947
In fact, I've never
seen her so upset.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.999
And she did have a key to the
drawer where you keep your gun?

29:17.055 --> 29:19.865
Yes, but so do the day
manager, the night manager

29:19.925 --> 29:21.295
and my bookkeeper.

29:21.493 --> 29:24.673
You don't think any of them
killed Charles Kovac, do you?

29:25.397 --> 29:26.597
Of course not.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.243
Thank you.

29:30.836 --> 29:33.746
Day manager, night manager,
bookkeeper.

29:34.339 --> 29:36.649
You left out owner, didn't you?

29:37.643 --> 29:39.783
I have a key to my own desk.

29:40.045 --> 29:42.525
You also had an argument
with Mr. Kovac

29:42.581 --> 29:46.621
that was so loud, one of your customers
called the police. Isn't that true?

29:46.818 --> 29:48.488
The man was a pig.

29:49.221 --> 29:52.331
I was losing enough business
because of the repairs.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.601
I didn't need the mess
spilling into my dining room.

29:55.661 --> 30:00.611
So, in effect, Mr. Kovac was
taking money out of your pocket.

30:02.334 --> 30:05.014
To some people,
that's motive for murder.

30:05.304 --> 30:09.314
Objection. This is not cross examination.
It's pure speculation.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.975
Let's move on.

30:12.945 --> 30:16.515
Was Danny Johnson what you
would call a regular customer?

30:17.049 --> 30:19.929
He borrowed money
maybe half a dozen times.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.499
At first, a grand or two.

30:23.121 --> 30:25.071
Worked his way up to eight.

30:25.290 --> 30:28.790
And how was Mr. Johnson able
to repay these loans?

30:30.796 --> 30:32.466
Last time, I said,

30:32.965 --> 30:35.775
"Eight grand is
a major obligation, Danny."

30:36.068 --> 30:39.708
He says, "Don't worry.
The wife is good for it."

30:43.008 --> 30:44.388
Thank you.

30:46.645 --> 30:51.085
You said Danny Johnson
borrowed $8,000,

30:51.149 --> 30:55.329
but the night he died, he was
supposed to repay you $15,000.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.628
Well, there's interest.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.729
Almost 100%?

31:00.192 --> 31:03.472
Well, that's not legal, is it?

31:04.096 --> 31:06.736
I don't know.
I didn't go to law school.

31:06.798 --> 31:07.998
ELLIOT: I see.

31:09.334 --> 31:13.414
When someone doesn't repay
an illegal loan,

31:14.606 --> 31:16.136
what do you do?

31:16.341 --> 31:18.751
I convince them it's in their
interest to make good.

31:18.810 --> 31:21.650
Come on, Mr. Breck. What you
do is break people's legs.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.893
Objection! Mr. Elliot
has no basis for this...

31:23.949 --> 31:27.619
The People are not the only ones
with a theory here, Your Honor.

31:27.819 --> 31:29.729
Overruled.
The witness will answer.

31:30.922 --> 31:32.492
Break legs? No,

31:33.258 --> 31:35.428
but a person could get hurt.

31:35.927 --> 31:39.527
Okay. Did you ever
hurt Danny Johnson?

31:40.098 --> 31:41.978
I never laid a hand on him.

31:42.100 --> 31:46.280
On the night he was killed, his
payment was how many weeks overdue?

31:46.605 --> 31:47.735
Three.

31:49.441 --> 31:53.321
$15,000, three weeks late,

31:54.112 --> 31:57.392
and you never
laid a hand on him?

32:06.558 --> 32:09.198
Two murders,
two cross-examinations,

32:10.195 --> 32:14.225
and this defense lawyer makes
suspects out of your own witnesses.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.076
Aren't we lucky
this isn't on TV?

32:17.135 --> 32:19.115
Elliot's just blowing
a lot of smoke.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.451
I don't think
it's gonna go over.

32:20.505 --> 32:23.605
Well, that's fine,
but you two are not the jury.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.653
If any of them thinks
for one minute

32:26.712 --> 32:28.622
that the restaurant owner
killed Kovac...

32:28.680 --> 32:30.350
Or how about this?

32:30.849 --> 32:33.299
A loan shark
killed Danny Johnson.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.162
Now, that's called reasonable doubt.
Offer a plea.

32:36.221 --> 32:37.891
I already did.
They turned it down.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.436
ADAM: Of course they did.

32:39.658 --> 32:42.538
Well, at least you've got
one redeeming factor.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.134
And what's that?

32:44.196 --> 32:46.066
Saving the citizens
a little money.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.701
Losing two cases
for the price of one.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.482
We've got Detective Logan
coming up on the stand.

32:54.206 --> 32:58.146
He'll link Denise Johnson to Kovac
and the gun that killed him.

33:01.947 --> 33:04.477
Mr. Kovac was
behind the couch here.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.334
He'd been shot once in the chest
with a .22 caliber pistol

33:08.387 --> 33:11.227
which we recovered
at Contini's Restaurant.

33:11.790 --> 33:15.330
Did you obtain phone company reports
from Mr. Kovac:'s apartment?

33:15.393 --> 33:18.503
Yes. They showed a phone call
from Mr. Kovac to Denise Johnson

33:18.563 --> 33:20.603
on the day of
Danny Johnson's murder.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.505
Thank you, Detective.

33:25.504 --> 33:29.484
Did the police department make a
recording of that conversation?

33:29.641 --> 33:32.451
We usually don't investigate
before a crime is committed.

33:32.511 --> 33:36.691
Then you don't actually know that
Mrs. Johnson and Kovac ever spoke.

33:37.949 --> 33:42.129
Detective, would you read the
highlighted portion of People's Eight,

33:42.187 --> 33:43.667
your activity report.

33:44.890 --> 33:48.200
"Mr. Johnson's death occurred in the
course of an apparent armed robbery."

33:48.293 --> 33:49.403
A robbery.

33:49.461 --> 33:52.871
And did you find the money
taken from Danny Johnson

33:52.931 --> 33:54.641
during the commission
of that crime?

33:54.699 --> 33:57.149
Yes, it was in
Mr. Kovac:'s apartment.

33:57.202 --> 33:59.712
And that money, in a sense,

34:00.772 --> 34:03.282
belonged to Mr. Breck,
didn't it?

34:03.508 --> 34:07.048
Well, it was being repaid
to Mr. Breck's employers, yes.

34:07.279 --> 34:12.228
At one point, didn't you suspect
Mr. Breck of killing Kovac?

34:13.752 --> 34:15.062
We did talk to him.

34:15.120 --> 34:18.260
In fact, you accused him
of being the killer.

34:18.489 --> 34:21.270
That's a common
interrogation technique.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.839
Sounds like a good one.

34:27.831 --> 34:31.442
Detective Logan, why did you
stop pursuing other leads

34:31.503 --> 34:33.513
in the murder of Charles Kovac?

34:33.572 --> 34:35.922
Because the phone call
from Mr. Kovac

34:35.974 --> 34:38.614
and the gun we recovered
at Contini's Restaurant

34:38.677 --> 34:41.587
both point to the defendant,
Denise Johnson.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.822
JACK: Thank you, Detective.

34:44.181 --> 34:46.992
Your Honor, at this time
the People rest.

34:47.619 --> 34:51.859
The Defense moves, pursuant
to CPL Section 290.10,

34:51.922 --> 34:54.063
for trial order of dismissal.

34:55.893 --> 34:58.504
I'll hear from counsel
in 15 minutes.

34:59.564 --> 35:03.384
A motion to dismiss at the end of the
People's case is pro forma, Your Honor.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.205
If you think I'm wasting your time
by asking to hear this one argued,

35:06.271 --> 35:07.311
you don't have to say anything.

35:07.372 --> 35:10.952
I've seen some blatant bootstrapping,
Your Honor, but this takes the prize.

35:11.009 --> 35:14.479
Johnson's murder explains Kovac:'s?
Kovac:'s explains Johnson's?

35:14.546 --> 35:16.986
So the evidence overlaps.
Since when is that a weakness?

35:17.048 --> 35:18.578
Without calling
a single witness,

35:18.650 --> 35:21.030
I've established alternate
theories for both murders.

35:21.086 --> 35:23.226
Right. Dead-ending
in the police investigation.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.698
Our theory is the only one
that explains both murders.

35:25.757 --> 35:29.827
If you assume the existence of
the very plot you need to prove.

35:30.328 --> 35:32.138
Jack Ruby guns down Oswald.

35:32.197 --> 35:36.197
It might seem like whoever killed
Kennedy wanted Oswald silenced,

35:36.268 --> 35:39.218
but only if you've already come
up with a conspiracy theory.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.651
I have more than theory.
Two men are dead.

35:41.706 --> 35:43.946
The defendant had access to the
gun that killed one of them.

35:44.009 --> 35:45.549
KAYLIN: May I say something?

35:45.610 --> 35:49.790
You're right, Mr. McCoy, the gun
killed one of them, Charles Kovac.

35:50.415 --> 35:52.485
But regarding the murder
of Daniel Johnson, however,

35:52.551 --> 35:55.461
the People have not made
a prima facie case.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.357
I'm dismissing that count
of the indictment.

35:57.422 --> 36:00.342
Now, that's the post holding up the
People's entire tent, Your Honor.

36:00.392 --> 36:03.402
Without that charge, they don't
have any case against my client

36:03.461 --> 36:04.841
for the Kovac killing, either.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.526
Hold it. Ruby did kill Oswald.

36:06.598 --> 36:07.938
Point taken.

36:08.033 --> 36:10.213
The Kovac: matter
will go to the jury.

36:10.268 --> 36:11.408
Thank you, Your Honor.

36:11.469 --> 36:12.709
Don't thank me yet.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.811
You're gonna have to make
your case without any hint

36:14.873 --> 36:17.443
that Mrs. Johnson was involved
in the murder of her husband.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.679
I will so instruct the jury.

36:19.744 --> 36:21.754
But, Your Honor...
What?

36:32.023 --> 36:34.233
So, now we're trying a woman
for the murder

36:34.292 --> 36:36.172
of the hit man she hired
to kill her husband,

36:36.228 --> 36:38.298
but we can't mention
the husband.

36:38.363 --> 36:43.073
Beef up the rest of the story, and dig
up some hard evidence on Mrs. Johnson

36:43.134 --> 36:45.644
linking her to
the murder of Kovac:.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.944
To use how?
We rested our case.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.706
At least we'll be ready
to punch holes in theirs.

36:51.276 --> 36:54.376
Go over the ground again
with Briscoe and Logan.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.323
What am I looking for?

36:56.381 --> 36:58.621
An eyewitness would be lovely.

36:59.784 --> 37:04.134
Nobody saw Mrs. Johnson with Kovac.
Nobody even heard the gunshot.

37:04.689 --> 37:06.069
Okay, what else have we got?

37:06.124 --> 37:09.904
We've got phone records, just that
one call, the gun at Contini's.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.641
She was in the office,
but no one saw her take it.

37:12.697 --> 37:14.197
Yeah, what's this?

37:14.266 --> 37:16.906
It's an old attempted robbery
against Johnson.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.808
Two months before
he was killed.

37:18.870 --> 37:22.110
Okay, the robber put a gun behind
Johnson's ear and pulled the trigger.

37:22.173 --> 37:25.453
The gun jammed. The robber took off
on foot with the gun in his hand.

37:25.510 --> 37:28.320
He was caught by
a passing anti-crime car.

37:28.380 --> 37:31.950
Don't these guys usually ask for
money before they pull the trigger?

37:32.617 --> 37:34.257
This one didn't.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.655
It was a Monday night.

37:38.823 --> 37:40.233
The shooter
flagged down Johnson

37:40.292 --> 37:43.542
right after the bingo lady,
his regular Monday night fare.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.865
Just like Kovac.
What are the odds of that?

37:45.930 --> 37:49.500
We always figured Mrs. Johnson
tipped Kovac to the bingo lady.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.411
Yeah, well, maybe
she tried this once before.

37:56.341 --> 37:58.821
I tried to take
that cabby down,

37:58.877 --> 38:00.247
and it didn't go right.

38:01.112 --> 38:04.222
Just like I said
when I made my plea agreement.

38:04.716 --> 38:09.216
Are you certain, Mr. Lattimer, you weren't
trying to do more than just rob him?

38:11.890 --> 38:14.430
I would've played gin rummy with
him, except I didn't have the time,

38:14.492 --> 38:16.272
you know what I'm saying?

38:17.729 --> 38:19.939
We think you may have
wanted to kill him.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.668
Read my label, miss.

38:21.733 --> 38:24.813
Attempted armed robbery,
two-to-six. That's it.

38:24.936 --> 38:29.386
If you were hired to kill that cab
driver, and you can tell us by whom,

38:30.608 --> 38:32.778
we can change those numbers.

38:34.179 --> 38:37.089
You want me to cop
to attempted murder, man?

38:38.116 --> 38:39.616
No, that's all right.

38:39.684 --> 38:41.994
That ain't good
for this black man's health.

38:42.187 --> 38:45.627
We're not after you. We want
the person who hired you.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.432
And if I give it up?

38:52.497 --> 38:55.207
You can call a cab and go home.

39:02.707 --> 39:03.907
(SIGHS)

39:05.376 --> 39:07.046
The cabby's wife.

39:08.746 --> 39:09.916
Name?

39:09.981 --> 39:11.191
Denise.

39:13.251 --> 39:16.821
She gave me the address to his last fare.
Some old lady.

39:17.455 --> 39:19.125
I waved him down.

39:22.427 --> 39:25.407
I think I'm gonna make that
phone call now, all right?

39:26.464 --> 39:27.884
Interesting.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.912
Get this kid to confess
to a more serious crime,

39:30.969 --> 39:32.239
and you reduce his sentence.

39:32.337 --> 39:34.037
He gave us Denise Johnson.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.545
Denise Johnson.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.047
You're gonna charge her

39:37.108 --> 39:39.878
with attempted murder for the
first try on her husband?

39:39.978 --> 39:41.358
CLAIRE: I know, a tough sell.

39:41.413 --> 39:43.923
All we have is the uncorroborated
testimony of an accomplice.

39:43.982 --> 39:48.162
Johnny-come-lately, you should have
connected her with this punk hit man

39:48.219 --> 39:49.759
before you rested your case.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.531
We'll petition the judge
to reopen.

39:51.589 --> 39:53.299
Judge Kaylin, yeah.

39:53.658 --> 39:55.568
Dismissed half your case
in the first place.

39:55.627 --> 39:59.197
If I can't reopen, I'll put the
hit man on as a rebuttal witness.

39:59.264 --> 40:00.274
Rebuttal to what?

40:00.331 --> 40:03.941
I'll drag some statement out of
Mrs. Johnson on cross-examination

40:04.002 --> 40:05.072
that he can rebut.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.906
What cross-examination?

40:07.539 --> 40:08.919
Your case is such a shambles

40:08.973 --> 40:12.553
that the defense attorney would have
to be brain-dead to put her on.

40:12.877 --> 40:16.287
She doesn't take the stand, your
witness doesn't take the stand.

40:16.347 --> 40:18.917
Then, I'll just have to
convince the defense attorney

40:18.983 --> 40:22.293
that it's in his best interest
to call Mrs. Johnson.

40:24.489 --> 40:26.089
Best interest.

40:28.860 --> 40:32.710
I see no grounds to reopen, Mr. McCoy.
The People have rested.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.841
We'll hear from them again
in closing arguments.

40:34.899 --> 40:36.639
Will Your Honor
please remind counsel

40:36.701 --> 40:40.651
that those arguments may not
refer to any alleged conspiracy

40:40.705 --> 40:43.275
between my client
and Mr. Kovac?

40:43.408 --> 40:45.178
Don't worry, Brian.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.083
We've changed
our theory of the case.

40:47.145 --> 40:50.615
We'll be arguing that Mrs. Johnson
killed Kovac for revenge.

40:50.715 --> 40:51.955
Revenge?

40:52.050 --> 40:54.720
He killed her beloved husband.
She wanted to get even.

40:54.786 --> 40:55.986
That's fiction,
and they know it.

40:56.054 --> 40:59.404
We don't need your permission to present
a different motive to the jury.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.767
The Court's already ruled that
you can't mention any testimony

41:02.827 --> 41:04.767
regarding the murder
of my client's husband.

41:04.829 --> 41:07.969
The jury must disregard
Mrs. Johnson's role

41:08.032 --> 41:10.242
in the murder of her husband,
not Kovac's.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.641
He's right, Mr. Elliot.

41:11.703 --> 41:15.883
But there's no evidence that Mrs. Johnson
knew Kovac killed her husband,

41:15.940 --> 41:18.280
so how can she avenge something
she didn't know about?

41:18.343 --> 41:19.553
JACK: Black letter law.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.991
The jury can infer that she
had the requisite knowledge

41:22.046 --> 41:23.856
if they believe
she committed the act.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.895
Right again.
If you'll excuse me,

41:25.950 --> 41:28.400
I've got a jury sitting
on its thumbs in Part 27.

41:31.689 --> 41:33.599
That's very cute, Jack.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.726
But you forgot one thing.

41:37.028 --> 41:41.498
Revenge only makes sense if my client
was sorry her husband was dead.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.510
Well, the jury's going to hear
that that's not the case.

41:51.209 --> 41:54.089
It was like
living in quicksand.

41:55.113 --> 41:59.083
The more I tried to raise us up,
the more Danny dragged us down.

41:59.551 --> 42:00.761
ELLIOT: You mean into debt?

42:00.818 --> 42:02.258
Not just that.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.504
Emotionally...

42:05.590 --> 42:09.370
Danny's habits made
home life pretty shaky.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.444
Mrs. Johnson, in all honesty,

42:12.797 --> 42:15.937
how did you feel when you
heard your husband was dead?

42:16.567 --> 42:18.207
I felt terrible.

42:19.237 --> 42:20.937
He was my husband.

42:21.573 --> 42:23.613
And how else did you feel?

42:27.445 --> 42:28.745
Relieved.

42:29.047 --> 42:32.027
And were you angry
at the man who killed him?

42:33.952 --> 42:35.492
God help me,

42:36.621 --> 42:38.031
I was not.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.570
Thank you.

42:48.333 --> 42:49.573
So,

42:51.236 --> 42:54.146
your husband's murder
was a blessing?

42:54.505 --> 42:56.485
No, of course not.

42:56.541 --> 42:59.181
But you were better off
with him dead.

42:59.811 --> 43:03.691
All I wanted was
to make something of myself.

43:03.915 --> 43:07.185
For myself and my son
and my husband.

43:07.285 --> 43:08.955
But your husband
was hardly helping.

43:09.020 --> 43:12.520
He was the father of my child.
I did not want him dead.

43:15.560 --> 43:16.870
I see.

43:17.462 --> 43:20.572
You just didn't care much
one way or the other.

43:26.304 --> 43:28.154
Redirect, Mr. Elliot?

43:28.673 --> 43:31.153
No, Your Honor.
The Defense rests.

43:32.877 --> 43:35.687
The People would like to call a
rebuttal witness, Your Honor.

43:35.747 --> 43:37.087
Your Honor?

43:37.515 --> 43:38.815
Approach.

43:43.821 --> 43:45.771
What's this witness, Jack?

43:45.823 --> 43:50.363
He will refute the defendant's testimony
that she didn't want her husband dead.

43:50.695 --> 43:53.065
Now, how can he
possibly know that?

43:53.131 --> 43:56.441
Because Mrs. Johnson hired him
to kill her husband.

43:57.135 --> 43:59.305
Well, now, even if that's
true, it's irrelevant.

43:59.370 --> 44:02.510
My client is no longer on trial
for killing her husband.

44:02.573 --> 44:05.523
It goes to Mrs. Johnson's credibility.
That's always relevant.

44:05.576 --> 44:10.046
Your Honor, this would be
extremely prejudicial.

44:15.386 --> 44:17.826
Call your witness.
Now, just a minute.

44:20.091 --> 44:21.371
(SIGHING)

44:21.793 --> 44:24.833
Jack, can we meet?

44:27.965 --> 44:31.565
This so-called hit man can take
the stand for one reason only,

44:31.636 --> 44:33.506
to challenge
my client's credibility.

44:33.571 --> 44:36.211
Judge Kaylin can instruct
the jury any way he wants.

44:36.274 --> 44:39.264
They'll hear what
they need to, and you know it.

44:39.310 --> 44:42.290
If they convict,
I've got grounds for appeal.

44:42.346 --> 44:43.846
JACK: Mrs. Johnson,

44:45.383 --> 44:47.953
nobody likes to
let a murderer walk.

44:48.119 --> 44:50.659
The appellate judges
will know what you did.

44:54.992 --> 44:56.772
What are my choices?

45:00.031 --> 45:02.141
Man two.
She does three-to-nine.

45:02.266 --> 45:04.766
She's lucky the death penalty
isn't the law yet.

45:06.370 --> 45:09.010
Murder two.
15-to-life.

45:10.541 --> 45:13.781
If you wait for the jury
to convict, it'll be 25.

45:19.784 --> 45:22.364
I grew up
in a two-room apartment.

45:23.988 --> 45:26.088
My mother sent me
and my sisters to school

45:26.157 --> 45:29.037
with mashed potato sandwiches
for lunch.

45:30.795 --> 45:34.135
I pulled myself above that.

45:35.333 --> 45:38.343
No one helped me. Not Danny.

45:39.971 --> 45:42.281
People thought he was charming.

45:43.674 --> 45:48.094
When he took that $15,000
from me, it was not charming.

45:52.850 --> 45:55.160
Kovac, or the deal's off.

46:02.026 --> 46:05.126
After the police found
the money, he called me.

46:06.297 --> 46:09.297
He wanted cash
to get out of town.

46:12.170 --> 46:14.450
I took the gun

46:16.240 --> 46:18.910
and I went over
to his girlfriend's place.

46:20.678 --> 46:24.388
He would have been on my back
forever, just like Danny.

46:30.388 --> 46:31.588
(SIGHING)

46:45.303 --> 46:46.343
(DOOR CLOSING)

46:46.404 --> 46:50.084
She killed two men. Still
believes they're the bad guys.

46:51.108 --> 46:53.608
They interfered
with her cash flow.

46:55.413 --> 46:57.483
No, it wasn't about money.

47:00.718 --> 47:05.098
Maybe it wasn't the motive, but
it was her cue for passion.
