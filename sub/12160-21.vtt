WEBVTT

00:03.286 --> 00:05.187
Hey, listen up.
I'm only gonna ask this once.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.456
Who messed with my rod and reel
display downstairs?

00:07.524 --> 00:09.324
Huh?

00:09.392 --> 00:10.992
I can't tell a lie.

00:11.060 --> 00:13.662
Believe me, I've tried,
and there's no point.

00:13.729 --> 00:15.496
It was me.

00:15.564 --> 00:17.532
You messed with
that display downstairs?

00:17.599 --> 00:19.734
Well, I love it.

00:19.802 --> 00:22.871
It says "sales"
without being pushy.

00:22.938 --> 00:23.905
Good job.

00:26.607 --> 00:27.808
Please stop that.

00:27.876 --> 00:29.476
This isn't a chorus line,

00:29.544 --> 00:31.311
and you're certainly
no Tommy Tune.

00:31.379 --> 00:34.655
He knows how to do that.
He really swings his weight--

00:37.152 --> 00:38.617
I did summer stock, you know?

00:40.321 --> 00:42.922
To meet chicks.

00:42.990 --> 00:46.325
Kyle, he's only saying
you did a good job. That's all.

00:46.393 --> 00:48.561
I can't help it.
I love making Mr. B. Proud.

00:48.628 --> 00:49.929
Oh, please.

00:49.997 --> 00:52.548
I mean, after all,
one day he could be my father...

00:54.568 --> 00:57.136
In-law.

00:57.204 --> 01:01.006
Kyle, every now and then, I just
want to give you a compliment,

01:01.074 --> 01:02.407
without you reminding me

01:02.474 --> 01:05.209
what a poor provider
you'll be for my daughter.

01:07.113 --> 01:09.047
The thought of him
being my son-in-law.

01:09.115 --> 01:11.683
That's just what I need-- another
kid to feel responsible for.

01:11.751 --> 01:13.484
Just when I think these girls
are leaving the nest,

01:13.552 --> 01:15.986
they pick up stray birds
and bring 'em back home.

01:16.054 --> 01:18.089
But this weekend,

01:18.156 --> 01:19.924
you don't have to worry
about those needy dependents,

01:19.991 --> 01:21.759
because we're gonna
escape to nature

01:21.827 --> 01:25.596
as we defeat Ted's tackle box
in the grudge cup.

01:25.663 --> 01:27.832
Yeah. God,
I wish it was that easy.

01:27.899 --> 01:29.566
It will be.

01:29.634 --> 01:32.668
Look, 'cause I hired
a new forklift guy. Okay?

01:32.737 --> 01:34.204
Who's a master marksman.

01:34.271 --> 01:38.074
He can shoot a nut out of
a squirrel's paw at 400 yards.

01:39.243 --> 01:40.977
Can he operate the forklift?

01:41.045 --> 01:44.080
Who cares? After we win,
I'm gonna fire him.

01:44.148 --> 01:45.581
So let me get this straight.

01:45.649 --> 01:47.783
You hired a strange guy
who's a sniper,

01:47.851 --> 01:50.898
and you're gonna fire him.

01:52.188 --> 01:55.824
I might not have thought this
all the way through.

01:55.892 --> 01:57.760
There's potentially
another hiccup, too.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.061
Huh?

01:59.129 --> 02:01.230
Eve's soccer tournament semis
are today.

02:01.297 --> 02:03.030
If she wins today,

02:03.098 --> 02:05.733
the championship
is on Saturday.

02:05.801 --> 02:08.770
Oh, Mike, come on.
Our championship is Saturday.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.838
This is my daughter's
championship, Ed.

02:10.906 --> 02:14.441
I know, I know. Obviously,
we're rooting for Eve to win.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.577
Right. I want her to win.
I mean, I want her to win.

02:16.645 --> 02:18.812
Winning. I want her to win,
but you know, you...

02:18.880 --> 02:21.281
Can't win 'em all.

02:21.348 --> 02:24.951
If there's one to lose,
this would be the one to lose.

02:25.019 --> 02:28.521
Then we should-- should pray
for Eve's team to lose.

02:28.589 --> 02:30.690
Let's-- let's take a knee.

02:30.758 --> 02:32.492
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no. You don't--

02:32.559 --> 02:35.627
don't pray in public
for your kid to lose.

02:35.695 --> 02:38.831
Pray in the darkness
of your heart,

02:38.899 --> 02:41.267
when you're sitting
on the bleachers in the rain,

02:41.334 --> 02:44.036
staring down the barrel
of a double-header.

02:44.104 --> 02:46.939
Boy, 12th inning, 0-0.

02:47.007 --> 02:49.175
Just swing at something!

02:50.509 --> 02:51.442
All right, take a knee.

02:51.510 --> 02:52.476
Okay.

02:52.803 --> 02:55.493
Last Man Standing - S01E21
Wherefore Art Thou, Mike Baxter

02:55.613 --> 02:57.089
Original air date
April 10, 2011

02:57.209 --> 02:59.765
Sync and corrections by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

02:59.885 --> 03:01.385
Look at this.

03:01.453 --> 03:03.387
They're putting up flyers
all over the school

03:03.455 --> 03:07.024
for the school play.
They're throwing it in my face.

03:07.091 --> 03:08.358
Yeah, well, they may still
want people to come to it

03:08.426 --> 03:10.460
even though
you're not the star.

03:10.528 --> 03:13.663
I shouldn't be the understudy.
I should be playing Juliet.

03:13.731 --> 03:15.833
I am so much prettier
than Chloe Foster.

03:15.900 --> 03:19.036
Okay. Well, maybe Chloe Foster
is a better actress.

03:19.103 --> 03:22.038
Okay, now you just sound
like the director.

03:22.105 --> 03:25.641
Aw, honey, the important thing
is you guys did your best.

03:25.709 --> 03:29.345
I did my best.
Everyone else sucked.

03:29.412 --> 03:32.949
All right, you know, we'll talk
about your sportsmanship later.

03:33.016 --> 03:36.152
Looks like no championship
for me this weekend.

03:36.220 --> 03:37.919
What a bummer.

03:37.987 --> 03:39.420
Yeah.
It's a real bummer, honey.

03:39.488 --> 03:40.722
It's a bummer.

03:40.789 --> 03:41.857
Real bummer.

03:41.924 --> 03:44.159
For her.

03:46.996 --> 03:49.597
Hello, free Saturday.

03:49.665 --> 03:54.101
It's like a lunar eclipse--
rare, but spectacular.

03:54.169 --> 03:56.937
I'm telling you what,
it was hopeless.

03:57.005 --> 03:59.406
We're up by two goals,
not much time left.

03:59.474 --> 04:01.475
I see my weekend slipping away.

04:01.542 --> 04:05.407
Then, all of a sudden,
by magic... we blow it.

04:06.848 --> 04:09.583
You know, you're right.
There is power in prayer.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.284
Oh, yeah.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.919
Good morning, ladies.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.188
Sorry to break up
your little sewing circle.

04:15.256 --> 04:18.358
It's Ted. Maybe the prayer thing
will work now. Take a knee.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.725
Take a knee.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.929
Oh, that's not necessary.

04:22.997 --> 04:25.998
I just wanted to
bring by the grudge cup.

04:26.065 --> 04:28.267
What's it been?
Three years since you beat us?

04:28.334 --> 04:29.968
Four.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.037
Well, I just wanted
to let you know that this year,

04:32.105 --> 04:35.207
your team has a fighting chance.
I'm giving myself a handicap.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.410
More than the ones
God gave you?

04:38.477 --> 04:42.079
No. No, I'm gonna be competing
with inferior equipment.

04:42.147 --> 04:45.649
I'm buying everything
from your crappy store.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.754
We're doomed, Mike.

04:50.822 --> 04:52.290
Nah, we're gonna be fine.

04:52.357 --> 04:54.091
We lost the forklift guy.

04:54.159 --> 04:55.692
What?

04:55.760 --> 04:58.919
The guy that can shoot the nuts
off a squirrel at 400 yards?

05:00.597 --> 05:05.601
No. No, th-th-the nuts
out of a squirrel's paw.

05:07.671 --> 05:09.005
Not only that--
he can also shoot out

05:09.073 --> 05:11.308
a security camera
in a bank lobby.

05:11.375 --> 05:16.345
He's gonna miss the next
10 to 15 grudge cups.

05:16.413 --> 05:20.182
Good background check, Eddie.

05:20.250 --> 05:24.153
Yeah, yeah, let's try
that new wine and cheese place.

05:24.220 --> 05:27.022
Hmm?
No, no, no, I got lucky.

05:27.090 --> 05:28.223
Yeah, Eve lost the game.

05:28.291 --> 05:29.624
Mom. Mom.

05:29.692 --> 05:31.559
No, they had it won,
and then they blew it.

05:31.626 --> 05:33.094
It was awesome.

05:33.162 --> 05:36.331
I know.
Hi, Eve.

05:36.451 --> 05:39.767
Uh, you know what? Let me, uh,
let me-- let me call you back.

05:39.835 --> 05:41.502
- "It was awesome"? What's that supposed to mean?
- No, no, no. No.

05:41.570 --> 05:43.571
- I d-- I didn't mean "awesome." It didn't come out right.
- Well...

05:43.638 --> 05:45.673
What did you mean to say?
"Whoopee! Eve lost!"

05:45.740 --> 05:47.040
No, no, no, honey.
Of course not. It wasn't--

05:47.108 --> 05:48.342
did you want to do
a little dance?

05:48.409 --> 05:50.643
"Whoo-whoo! Eve's a loser!"

05:53.014 --> 05:54.414
Wow.

05:54.482 --> 05:57.684
Please tell me
that I was never like her.

05:57.751 --> 05:59.786
Oh, no, no, no.
You were the good one.

05:59.854 --> 06:02.888
You only made me
the world's youngest grandma.

06:07.127 --> 06:09.095
Boy, we are scraping
the bottom of the barrel now.

06:09.162 --> 06:11.630
Yeah, okay.
How about Willie in ammo? Huh?

06:11.698 --> 06:12.965
Yeah?

06:13.033 --> 06:15.001
Do you remember when
we had to reset the sign

06:15.068 --> 06:19.404
to "zero days
without an accident"?

06:19.472 --> 06:21.606
What are you guys doing?

06:21.673 --> 06:24.342
- We need a new guy for that, uh, grudge cup.
- Yeah.

06:24.410 --> 06:27.812
Oh, what's it been? Three years
since you beat Ted's tackle box?

06:27.880 --> 06:29.614
Four.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.749
Okay, how about Chuck
from the warehouse?

06:31.817 --> 06:32.817
Chuck from the warehouse.

06:32.885 --> 06:35.319
How about Kyle from right here?

06:35.387 --> 06:36.786
I've been practicing
a whole lot.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.322
Mm-hmm.

06:38.390 --> 06:41.525
But if you want to go with
someone else, I'm fine with it.

06:41.592 --> 06:43.427
I want to go with someone else.

06:43.495 --> 06:46.163
Ed. Ed, hey. Give us a minute,
will you, Kyle?

06:46.231 --> 06:47.464
Sure.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.865
Mike.

06:48.933 --> 06:51.901
Mike, I like the kid, all right?

06:51.968 --> 06:54.203
But I took him to
a shooting range once, right?

06:54.271 --> 06:57.640
Let's just say Castro wouldn't
stick him in a book depository.

06:59.876 --> 07:01.577
I'm just saying.

07:01.645 --> 07:03.212
Listen, listen, listen.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.281
I've seen the kid
during demonstrations,

07:05.349 --> 07:07.249
and he's getting pretty good
with a compound bow.

07:07.316 --> 07:09.217
But he's a rookie.
He'll crack.

07:09.285 --> 07:10.452
But maybe underneath
that lump of coal,

07:10.520 --> 07:12.254
maybe there's
a diamond in there.

07:13.556 --> 07:16.624
Fine. We'll butch him up
a little bit.

07:16.692 --> 07:19.627
Hey, Kyle. You're in.

07:19.695 --> 07:20.662
Sweet!

07:20.729 --> 07:21.963
I gotta call my mom

07:22.031 --> 07:24.598
to let her know
to feed my cats this weekend.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:36.896 --> 07:38.296
Wow, word on the street

07:38.364 --> 07:40.899
is you're taking Kyle
to that grudge cup thing.

07:40.967 --> 07:43.468
Yeah.
He's pretty excited about it.

07:43.535 --> 07:45.502
It's a good idea--
give him some confidence.

07:45.570 --> 07:47.338
It's a good idea for me, too,
'cause now I got a pack mule

07:47.405 --> 07:50.040
to carry all my stuff
to the campground.

07:50.108 --> 07:51.909
Great news! You guys!

07:51.977 --> 07:54.144
Chloe Foster fell off
the balcony in rehearsal

07:54.212 --> 07:55.779
and broke her collarbone!

07:55.847 --> 07:57.114
What?

07:57.182 --> 07:58.815
How is that great news?

07:58.884 --> 08:01.050
Well, not for her, but for me!
I'm the understudy, remember?

08:01.118 --> 08:02.551
Now I get to be Juliet.

08:02.619 --> 08:04.854
Wow, honey. That's great.

08:04.922 --> 08:05.855
When is it?

08:05.923 --> 08:07.357
This Saturday.

08:09.493 --> 08:13.329
"This Saturday"-- you mean
the Saturday closest to today?

08:13.397 --> 08:15.265
Yes. Tomorrow.

08:15.332 --> 08:17.332
You guys, I'm so excited.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.101
This is the culmination
of everything I deserve,

08:19.168 --> 08:21.736
and I'm almost more excited
for you guys. You know?

08:21.804 --> 08:24.206
You're gonna get to sit there
and watch me and applaud

08:24.274 --> 08:25.774
and then nudge
the people next to you

08:25.841 --> 08:27.475
and be all,
"yes, that's our daughter.

08:27.543 --> 08:30.345
Oh, yes, yes,
that is her real nose."

08:32.280 --> 08:35.383
Wow. So, honey,
there goes our free Saturday.

08:35.450 --> 08:36.984
Yeah.

08:37.052 --> 08:39.086
And we always said, as parents,

08:39.154 --> 08:42.423
it's important to be
at these sorts of functions.

08:42.490 --> 08:43.823
Mm-hmm.

08:43.892 --> 08:46.693
I'll be in the woods,
so let me know how things go.

08:46.761 --> 08:47.828
No, no, no.

08:47.896 --> 08:49.262
Dad, you cannot
miss opening night,

08:49.330 --> 08:50.897
and you can't miss
closing night.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.566
You may miss the one performance
in between those two.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.600
What time is the show?

08:54.668 --> 08:55.568
It's at 5:00.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.702
All right.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.271
We fish first thing
in the morning,

08:58.339 --> 09:01.007
then it's a hatchet toss,
then we're doing archery,

09:01.075 --> 09:02.675
then we're doing
a shooting range thing--

09:02.743 --> 09:04.109
you know what?
I can make it back,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.345
because echo lake's only
about an hour and a half away.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.847
No, there's no way
you're gonna make it.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.817
Ooh. Better start learning
my lines.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.254
Mandy.
No, you're the understudy.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.323
You don't know your lines?
What have you been doing?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.425
Uh, pretty much been
making fun of Chloe Foster

09:19.492 --> 09:21.826
'cause she didn't know
any of her lines.

09:21.893 --> 09:25.263
- Listen up. You do the work. You learn your lines.
- Okay, okay, okay.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.165
And actors-- they don't
think with their head.

09:27.232 --> 09:29.334
They feel with their heart.

09:29.401 --> 09:33.237
Wow.
Where's this coming from?

09:33.305 --> 09:36.106
Maybe I did
a little summer stock.

09:36.174 --> 09:38.342
What? Why?

09:38.409 --> 09:40.877
Meet girls until I met the...

09:40.945 --> 09:43.613
- You know, till I met the love of my life-- you.
- Yeah.

09:43.681 --> 09:45.648
Nice save.

09:45.716 --> 09:48.251
Just so you know, Mandy, mom
wishes you fell off that balcony

09:48.319 --> 09:50.253
so she can have another day free
for wine and cheese.

09:50.321 --> 09:51.988
Oh, Evey. Honey.

09:52.055 --> 09:53.622
W-what?
Isn't that the way you roll?

09:53.690 --> 09:56.092
No, no, of course not.
That's not the way I roll.

09:56.159 --> 09:58.027
Hey, you gals have some fun.

10:01.431 --> 10:03.932
Scarfing beans out of a can...

10:04.001 --> 10:06.568
Pine needles in my boxers...

10:06.636 --> 10:09.371
You burning that tick
off my arm...

10:09.438 --> 10:13.408
This is the greatest
night of my life.

10:13.476 --> 10:15.877
Wow. His first night
in the woods?

10:15.944 --> 10:19.114
You guys brought a real ringer.
What's next?

10:19.181 --> 10:21.649
Telling ghost stories
around the fire?

10:21.717 --> 10:23.851
We're not gonna do that,
are we?

10:25.353 --> 10:27.154
Well, I'm gonna head
back to the main camp,

10:27.222 --> 10:29.524
or as I like to call it,
the winner's circle.

10:29.591 --> 10:31.058
Oh.

10:31.126 --> 10:35.963
I... Left you a little present
behind the tent.

10:39.367 --> 10:41.134
I hate that guy.

10:42.970 --> 10:45.005
And not just because
he's regular.

10:45.072 --> 10:47.473
I haven't left a present
in three days.

10:48.709 --> 10:50.644
Hey, Ted was here.
Where were you?

10:50.711 --> 10:53.312
Putting a little present
in his tent.

10:56.050 --> 10:57.516
You know, I think that's great,

10:57.584 --> 11:00.653
how you guys exchange gifts
the night before a competition.

11:02.622 --> 11:04.557
Kyle, you got any
memories of camping?

11:04.624 --> 11:06.058
Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.594
I remember the first time
I went camping with my dad.

11:08.662 --> 11:10.429
He wasn't there.

11:10.496 --> 11:13.164
Um, it was my uncle Phil,

11:13.231 --> 11:16.434
and he hated camping.

11:16.501 --> 11:19.671
Well, Kyle, it...
Sounds magical.

11:19.738 --> 11:23.841
It's no big deal. It's just
my dad was never there for me.

11:23.909 --> 11:25.276
None of my business,

11:25.343 --> 11:28.046
but your dad sounds
like a real S.O.B.

11:28.113 --> 11:31.682
That's the same nickname
my mom had for him.

11:34.118 --> 11:36.853
I remember the first time
my dad and I went camping.

11:36.921 --> 11:40.090
That was during the depression.
Everybody was "camping."

11:48.031 --> 11:51.433
Going to Alex's house.
I'll be back... maybe...

11:51.501 --> 11:53.970
If mom even cares
enough to ask.

11:54.037 --> 11:56.472
All right, what the hell
is wrong with you?

11:56.539 --> 11:58.574
Mom hates me.
That's what's wrong with me.

11:58.642 --> 11:59.875
Okay, really, yes.

11:59.943 --> 12:01.342
Mom hates you,
just because she didn't want

12:01.410 --> 12:03.177
to go to your one millionth
soccer game this month?

12:03.245 --> 12:06.114
And by the way, have you ever
been to one of your games?

12:06.181 --> 12:09.618
They are horrible.
Nobody ever scores.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.220
That's because we play
a 5-4-1 trapping defense

12:12.287 --> 12:14.022
with a lone striker.

12:14.090 --> 12:17.057
Ugh. You know what is more
boring than your soccer games?

12:17.125 --> 12:19.960
Your description
of your soccer games.

12:20.028 --> 12:22.329
Look,
mom goes to everything--

12:22.396 --> 12:25.833
every game, every performance,
every recital of every kid.

12:25.900 --> 12:28.068
Why are you
suddenly on her side?

12:28.136 --> 12:32.705
I just sat through a pre-pre-k
graduation last week.

12:34.074 --> 12:35.374
I had to watch

12:35.442 --> 12:39.278
a bunch of 3-year-olds
finger-paint their own diplomas.

12:39.346 --> 12:41.280
That sounds rough.

12:41.348 --> 12:42.849
Yeah, just a little glimpse

12:42.916 --> 12:45.818
into what mom has been doing
for us for the past 20 years.

12:47.821 --> 12:49.921
Hey, Kristin. Oh-- hey.

12:49.989 --> 12:53.258
Oh, am I allowed
to say "hello" to you?

12:53.325 --> 12:55.460
Wa...

12:55.528 --> 12:57.863
What is it?
What's going on?

12:57.930 --> 13:00.065
Thanks, mom.

13:00.133 --> 13:02.233
Thanks for
coming to my games,

13:02.301 --> 13:05.002
and thank you for
always being there for me.

13:05.070 --> 13:08.139
No, seriously,
what is going on?

13:08.206 --> 13:09.940
Kristin explained it.

13:10.008 --> 13:12.710
I know, occasionally, my soccer
games can get a little boring.

13:12.778 --> 13:16.013
Oh, honey, no, I love
coming to your games, but...

13:16.081 --> 13:19.917
My curse is-- is, you girls,
you have so many interests.

13:19.985 --> 13:22.351
It's not like your--
your shiftless cousins

13:22.419 --> 13:25.288
who are smoking cloves
in the mall parking lot.

13:27.024 --> 13:29.492
Mom, you know
those aren't cloves, right?

13:35.299 --> 13:38.533
Eve, honey, look, you know...

13:38.601 --> 13:41.570
I-I do show up for everything,
and I don't mind, but...

13:41.637 --> 13:44.940
But-- but there are times
when I-I maybe wish

13:45.008 --> 13:47.242
that I was someplace else.

13:47.310 --> 13:48.777
You know, like tomorrow night.

13:48.845 --> 13:50.979
We-- we have to watch a bunch
of teenagers do Shakespeare.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.280
I mean, that is
gonna be unbearable.

13:54.649 --> 13:57.551
Thanks a lot, mom!

13:57.619 --> 14:02.223
No, u-unbearably sad! It's sad!
It's "Romeo and Juliet"!

14:02.290 --> 14:03.825
Come on.
Don't they kill themselves?

14:03.892 --> 14:07.995
Yeah, because their parents
didn't support them!

14:11.599 --> 14:14.634
You know, not since
the new testament

14:14.702 --> 14:16.336
has one man produced
this many fish.

14:16.403 --> 14:19.706
Here. Come on.

14:22.243 --> 14:24.810
For a team total
of 16.3 pounds.

14:24.878 --> 14:25.911
Whoo!

14:25.979 --> 14:26.779
Yeah!
All right.

14:26.847 --> 14:28.647
Hyah! We did it!

14:28.715 --> 14:32.200
â™ª

15:15.225 --> 15:16.793
Oh! Yeah!

15:16.860 --> 15:17.794
All right!

15:17.861 --> 15:18.961
Yeah!

15:19.029 --> 15:20.096
Nicely done.

15:20.164 --> 15:21.998
All tied up, one event to go,

15:22.065 --> 15:23.532
rifle range is
our bread and butter--

15:23.600 --> 15:25.201
trophy's coming home, man.

15:25.269 --> 15:27.136
Are you gonna be able to make it
to Mandy's play, Mr. B.?

15:27.204 --> 15:29.137
Yeah, as long as we get
this final event done in, um...

15:29.205 --> 15:31.039
90 seconds.

15:39.642 --> 15:42.109
It's five minutes to curtain.

15:42.178 --> 15:44.879
- Your father's cutting it awfully close.
- Yeah.

15:44.946 --> 15:46.714
It's not often you get to see
a show where the lead

15:46.782 --> 15:50.517
puts the play under her pillow
to "absorb" the part...

15:50.585 --> 15:53.987
Which is why I brought this.

15:55.823 --> 15:58.925
You're up, Mike.

15:58.993 --> 16:00.527
Oh. Here we go, buddy.

16:09.703 --> 16:12.205
Looks like one hole,
but it was five bullets.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.208
All right, I gotta go.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.443
Oh, hey, you can't leave yet.
The kid needs you.

16:17.511 --> 16:19.945
He'll crumble without you.
No, he won't.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.581
Yes, I will.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.448
I can't wait
for these lollygaggers

16:23.516 --> 16:26.384
to go through their rotation.
This is gonna take forever.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.052
Okay, wait a minute.
Priorities, Mike.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.689
Now you're not gonna choose
your family over the grudge cup.

16:30.756 --> 16:32.357
As odd as that sounds,

16:32.425 --> 16:34.926
yes, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

16:34.993 --> 16:37.795
The kid needs you.
He's practically an orphan.

16:37.863 --> 16:39.963
Kyle, you don't need me.

16:40.031 --> 16:42.299
That's what my dad used to say.

16:51.443 --> 16:52.576
Look at this guy.

16:52.644 --> 16:53.977
We can beat him.

16:54.045 --> 16:56.379
He couldn't hit that tarp
with an R.P.G.

16:56.447 --> 16:57.980
Let's win this.

17:01.985 --> 17:04.319
That thou overheard'st,
ere I was ware,

17:04.387 --> 17:08.057
my true love's passion--
therefore pardon me...

17:10.492 --> 17:12.327
Methinks...

17:13.563 --> 17:14.929
Me...

17:14.997 --> 17:17.499
Mayday, mayday, pull the chute.

17:18.635 --> 17:20.335
Shh.

17:20.403 --> 17:22.871
M-methinks...

17:22.938 --> 17:25.273
Usually, Juliet doesn't
commit suicide

17:25.340 --> 17:27.141
till the end of the play.

17:30.345 --> 17:34.415
Methinks I should have stayed
away from that Romeo guy...

17:34.483 --> 17:36.850
Because now
I'm totally into him,

17:36.918 --> 17:38.653
and our families are,
like, seriously bummed...

17:38.720 --> 17:42.989
- Oh, no, no, no.
- And it is tearing me apart... Ith.

17:51.999 --> 17:53.800
Hey, listen.

17:54.835 --> 17:56.303
Sorry I missed the play.

17:56.370 --> 17:58.970
I know you're angry with me,
and I know I smell like trout.

17:59.038 --> 18:01.774
Well, you do,
and, uh, I'm not mad.

18:01.841 --> 18:03.241
Why not?

18:03.310 --> 18:05.711
Because i am
the good parent today,

18:05.779 --> 18:08.747
and you are deep, deep,
deep in the doghouse

18:08.815 --> 18:10.582
with our daughter.

18:10.650 --> 18:12.250
Three "deep"s, huh?

18:12.319 --> 18:13.852
Three, yeah.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.753
Hey.
Oh, yeah, right on time.

18:15.821 --> 18:18.189
Well, you gals have fun.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.961
Mandy, look, I'm real sorry
I missed your play.

18:24.029 --> 18:25.563
Yeah. I'm sorry, too.

18:25.631 --> 18:27.865
Really could have used
your support there, dad.

18:27.933 --> 18:30.467
Yeah, well...
H-how'd it go?

18:30.535 --> 18:33.303
It was a complete disaster.

18:33.371 --> 18:35.806
Well, it is a tragedy.

18:37.675 --> 18:39.242
Yeah.

18:39.310 --> 18:43.413
Sure is. Not many Juliets get
laughs during the death scene.

18:44.649 --> 18:46.582
Why were they laughing at you?

18:46.650 --> 18:49.618
Because I didn't know
any of my lines,

18:49.686 --> 18:52.187
and then I started
making stuff up, and then...

18:52.255 --> 18:56.258
I got so nervous, I pulled out
one of my hair extensions.

18:56.326 --> 18:57.993
Why don't you know your lines?

18:58.061 --> 19:00.162
I mean, you're the understudy.
That's, like, your job.

19:00.230 --> 19:01.296
Really?

19:01.365 --> 19:02.564
You didn't even
bother to show up,

19:02.631 --> 19:03.798
and you've got the nerve
to criticize me?

19:03.866 --> 19:05.199
I'm just, you know,

19:05.267 --> 19:08.102
sticking up for those people
that did show up.

19:12.007 --> 19:14.976
I don't know. I thought
I could wing it. You know?

19:15.043 --> 19:17.078
You do the work.

19:17.145 --> 19:19.747
That's what we do around here.
Your mom and I do the work.

19:19.814 --> 19:21.849
When I wanted a BB gun as a kid,
I didn't ask my parents.

19:21.916 --> 19:24.050
I went and sold seeds
door to door. I did the work.

19:24.118 --> 19:25.786
Got the BB gun,
wanted to be the best shot,

19:25.854 --> 19:27.755
so I practiced
on targets, on windows,

19:27.822 --> 19:29.356
on-- on people's lampposts,

19:29.424 --> 19:31.958
and finally,
I shot your grandma.

19:32.026 --> 19:33.794
You shot grandma?

19:33.862 --> 19:35.327
Well, she dared me to do it.

19:35.396 --> 19:36.996
She-- she kept saying,

19:37.063 --> 19:39.231
"you couldn't hit
the broad side of a barn."

19:39.299 --> 19:40.800
Have you ever seen
her walking away?

19:40.868 --> 19:43.202
She looks just like
the broad side of a barn.

19:43.270 --> 19:44.604
I took a ping at her,
going down the stairs.

19:44.671 --> 19:47.306
I dropped her right there
at the top of the stairs.

19:47.374 --> 19:49.675
I'm not proud of that,
you know?

19:49.743 --> 19:51.342
Are you gonna do this again?

19:51.411 --> 19:54.245
There's another show
next Saturday.

19:54.313 --> 19:56.448
You do the work,
I'll be there in the front row.

19:56.516 --> 19:59.083
Dad, what if I do the work,
and then they still laugh at me?

19:59.151 --> 20:02.554
Well, Shakespeare did comedies.

20:04.724 --> 20:06.357
You'll be good. I'm sorry
I missed this. I really am.

20:06.425 --> 20:07.357
Thanks.

20:07.426 --> 20:08.392
You bet.

20:08.460 --> 20:11.161
Oh. What the hell?

20:11.229 --> 20:13.196
Come on. Come on.

20:13.264 --> 20:15.833
You were deep, deep,
deep in the doghouse.

20:15.901 --> 20:17.535
I did the work.

20:17.602 --> 20:19.169
Yeah, mom. He did the work.

20:19.237 --> 20:22.139
No, i did the work.
I sat through the whole play.

20:22.206 --> 20:25.508
And I didn't even laugh,
even with that death scene,

20:25.576 --> 20:28.110
and it was hysterical.

20:36.121 --> 20:36.835
Now to be clear,

20:36.955 --> 20:40.480
that's "t-e-d-apostrophe-s"...

20:40.547 --> 20:43.984
Mm-hmm. I know how to spell
"Ted's tackle box," all right?

20:44.051 --> 20:47.053
Whose idea was it that the loser
had to pay for the engraving?

20:47.121 --> 20:49.422
- Oh, that was your brainchild, Ed.
- Uh-huh.

20:49.490 --> 20:52.391
Well, it seemed like a good idea
when we were winning.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.160
Well, I'll tell you,

20:54.228 --> 20:56.929
when that kid started
to land those bull's-eyes,

20:56.997 --> 21:02.101
I began sweating-- whoo--
but then the old man choked.

21:02.168 --> 21:05.037
Yeah. Yeah, well,
I lost my focus.

21:05.105 --> 21:07.506
I wanted to win
that trophy so badly.

21:07.573 --> 21:10.542
But listen,
it wasn't a complete loss.

21:10.610 --> 21:12.777
We may have made
a man out of Kyle.

21:12.845 --> 21:15.780
What? That blonde chick
you brought along?

21:15.848 --> 21:18.415
Hey. Lard-ass.

21:18.483 --> 21:20.685
Your piece of crap's
parked in our loading zone.
