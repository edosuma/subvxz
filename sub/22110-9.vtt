06:12.989 --> 06:14.624
and put up this year's
Christmas lights.

06:14.658 --> 06:17.126
Then I need you to get
the eggnog cups out of the attic

06:17.160 --> 06:18.895
and bump your head
on a low eave.

06:18.928 --> 06:21.230

take my cousins to the airport

06:22.666 --> 06:24.701
at a different,
farther away airport.

06:24.734 --> 06:26.636
Then shovel and salt the walk.

06:26.670 --> 06:28.605
Then shovel and salt
the driveway.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.074
Then shovel and salt
Mrs. Whitaker's driveway.

06:31.107 --> 06:33.142
She's 96 and has no one
to help her.

06:33.176 --> 06:35.812
We need four netted bags

06:35.845 --> 06:38.982
Get the bags at Hobby Lobby
and the pinecones at Pier 1.

06:39.015 --> 06:42.051
Next, inflate the giant snowman
and put it on our front lawn.

06:42.085 --> 06:44.454
The pump's broken, so you'll
have to do it by mouth.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.756
Then it's just laundry,
take out the trash,

06:46.790 --> 06:48.825
and move the house
a little bit to the left.

06:48.858 --> 06:51.094

some of that tomorrow?

09:36.492 --> 09:38.161
Look how skinny I am.

09:38.194 --> 09:40.463
Yay! It's Christmas!

09:40.496 --> 09:44.167
And I made your favorite, peanut
butter chocolate chip cookies.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.969
Wow, these are all for me?!

09:46.002 --> 09:47.136
Of course, Petey.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.839
It's Christmas;
everything's for you.

09:49.873 --> 09:52.075
Yay! Cookies at 7:00 a.m.!

09:52.108 --> 09:53.609
Thank you, careless parent!

09:53.643 --> 09:55.278
I'm gonna eat 'em and hum!

09:55.311 --> 09:58.782
(humming "Jingle Bells")

09:58.815 --> 10:01.017
See? Look how happy I was.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.786
That's the Christmas spirit.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.688
I haven't felt that in years.

10:04.721 --> 10:06.856
Yeah, looks like your mom
really went out of her way

10:06.890 --> 10:08.524
to make Christmas
special for you.

10:08.557 --> 10:10.126
-She sure did.
-(door opens)

10:10.159 --> 10:11.828
Oh, hey, look,
there's my friend Holden!

10:11.861 --> 10:13.830
Merry Christmas, Peter!

10:13.863 --> 10:15.264
He could still talk then.

10:15.298 --> 10:16.833
I wonder what happened to him.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.868
I gotta go!
I gotta go!

10:18.902 --> 10:22.405
Hold it in!
Hold it in! Hold it in!

10:24.573 --> 10:27.210
(slurring):
Hold it in! Hold it in!

10:27.243 --> 10:28.845
Hold it in!

10:28.878 --> 10:31.815
Hold in! Hold in!

10:31.848 --> 10:33.349
Holden.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.151
You died before Game of Thrones,

10:35.184 --> 10:37.353
but a-a lot of people
will like that.

10:40.423 --> 10:42.491
What is this?
Are we still in the past?

10:42.525 --> 10:44.227
No, this is the present.

10:44.260 --> 10:47.330
And I just want you to see
that not everyone in Quahog

10:47.363 --> 10:49.232
has lost the Christmas spirit.

10:49.265 --> 10:50.233
Christmas!

10:50.266 --> 10:51.500
-What's this?!
-Coal!

10:51.534 --> 10:52.535
-Why?!
-Bad!

10:52.568 --> 10:53.903
Aw!

10:57.440 --> 10:58.875
Ho, ho, ho!

10:58.908 --> 11:02.345
(babbling incoherently)

11:02.378 --> 11:05.248
Thank you, Santa!

11:05.281 --> 11:06.983
Daddy, you missed Santa.

11:07.016 --> 11:08.151
He was right here.

11:08.184 --> 11:11.187

11:40.149 --> 11:42.151

11:44.788 --> 11:47.290
Wow, no wonder I don't see
Cleveland until New Year's.

11:47.323 --> 11:48.792
At least they're together.

11:48.825 --> 11:51.560
Well, I know one family that
isn't together for Christmas.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.602
That was a delicious meal,
Daddy.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.205
You all laughed when
I suggested Boston Market.

12:02.238 --> 12:03.907
Well, who's laughing now?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.809
(laughs)

12:05.842 --> 12:07.043
I guess I am.

12:07.076 --> 12:08.945
All right, everyone,
grab your hot ciders

12:08.978 --> 12:10.646
and gather around
the speakerphone.

12:10.679 --> 12:14.117
It's time to call my
grandmother, Nana Pewterschmidt.

12:16.786 --> 12:19.755
(line rings)

12:19.789 --> 12:21.791
(speaking German)

12:34.370 --> 12:35.504
What did she say?

12:35.538 --> 12:37.340
She wishes you
a merry Christmas.

12:37.373 --> 12:38.842
That's not what she said.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.343
Time for figgy pudding!

12:40.376 --> 12:42.678
-Yay!
-(laughs)

12:42.711 --> 12:44.680
Seems like they're having
a good time without you.

12:44.713 --> 12:46.182
Oh, they're just
pretending to have fun.

12:46.215 --> 12:47.350
I'm sure they miss me.

12:47.383 --> 12:49.118
We should probably call Durd.

12:49.152 --> 12:50.753
You mean Dad?

12:50.786 --> 12:52.989
No, the fat guy
who sleeps with Mom.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.024
You guys talking 'bout Durd?

12:55.058 --> 12:57.593
More champagne, miss?

12:57.626 --> 12:59.695
(chuckles):
Miss? Oh, my!

12:59.728 --> 13:02.131
It's been a long time
since anybody's called me miss.

13:02.165 --> 13:04.767
(chuckles):
Wow! Merry Christmas, huh?

13:04.800 --> 13:07.203
Oh, Merry Chris-miss! Ha!

13:07.236 --> 13:08.671
(both laugh)

13:08.704 --> 13:11.607
Oh, my God, she's doing
that flirty laugh she does.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.110
It's subtle, but when you've
been married as long as we have,

13:14.143 --> 13:15.544
you notice these things.

13:15.578 --> 13:18.147
(laughs)

13:18.181 --> 13:19.715
You're very funny, Lance.

13:19.748 --> 13:21.717
You're a very handsome,
funny man.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.286
Now, let's see that penis!

13:23.319 --> 13:25.321
Yeah, see, again,
if you read between the lines,

13:25.354 --> 13:26.489
she's flirting.

13:26.522 --> 13:28.291
Why, this isn't
a merry Christmas at all.

13:28.324 --> 13:30.226
I don't like anything
you're showing me, Pat...

13:30.259 --> 13:31.627

13:51.080 --> 13:53.482
there's no way my family
won't be right back here

Christmas Yet to Come.

14:06.529 --> 14:08.397
I'm shaping your future.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.934

14:10.967 --> 14:15.438
Oops. That's what happens when
I talk while I'm doing this.

14:15.471 --> 14:17.806
Is this how Jonah Hill was made?

14:20.977 --> 14:22.778
I can't believe
our buddy's dead.

14:22.811 --> 14:26.615
I know. And it's so sad,
he left his family with nothing.

14:26.649 --> 14:29.685
Yeah, Lois had to sell
her clothes to get by.

14:29.718 --> 14:32.088
I mean, I love having
this underwear, I just...

14:32.121 --> 14:34.123

14:36.092 --> 14:38.294
Who's this poor Benjamin
that just died?

14:38.327 --> 14:40.096
Nobody ever said Benjamin.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.530
Poor, dead Benjamin.

14:41.564 --> 14:43.032
All right,
you're not getting it.

14:43.066 --> 14:45.068
Let me just take you
to your house.

14:50.006 --> 14:53.142
Boy, I love the holiday season
with my husband

14:53.176 --> 14:55.544
who's right upstairs,
just out of frame.

14:55.578 --> 14:56.712
Oh, am I coming down?

14:56.745 --> 14:58.281
Oh, please tell me
I lost the weight

14:58.314 --> 14:59.648
and kept it off this time.

14:59.682 --> 15:01.484
Merry Christmas!

15:01.517 --> 15:02.818
Who's that guy?

15:02.851 --> 15:04.988
That's Lois's new husband,
Lance.

15:05.021 --> 15:06.322
Wow.

15:06.355 --> 15:08.657
I finally had the guts
to leave her.

15:08.691 --> 15:09.959
Good for you, Peter.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.727
What about the kids?
How are they doing?

15:11.760 --> 15:12.996
See for yourself.

15:13.029 --> 15:14.930
All right, everybody,
I'm off to Colombia...

15:15.864 --> 15:16.932
Chris got into Columbia?

15:17.366 --> 15:18.834
...South America.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.669
Where I will attempt
to smuggle drugs

15:20.703 --> 15:23.006
back into the country
in my rectum.

15:23.039 --> 15:25.441
Aw, I knew there was
some kind of rug-pull coming.

15:25.474 --> 15:27.843
-And I'm off to Yale...
-The lock maker?

15:27.876 --> 15:31.180
...the lock maker,
where I have a minimum wage job.

15:31.214 --> 15:33.349
All right, okay, yeah,
I'm-I'm getting ahead of these.

15:33.382 --> 15:34.917
I'm going to Brown...

15:34.950 --> 15:39.155
four boxes of Jimmy Dean pure
pork sausage for my breakfast.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.824
Well, I'm proud all my kids
got into Ivy League puns,

15:41.857 --> 15:43.359
but what happened to Brian?

15:46.695 --> 15:48.764
Hey, what's Brian doing
out here in the graveyard?

15:48.797 --> 15:50.766
He usually sleeps
at the foot of my bed.

15:50.799 --> 15:52.901
He still does.

15:56.572 --> 15:58.041
Oh, my God!

15:58.074 --> 16:00.476
I'm dead? But how?

16:00.509 --> 16:04.213
You died from a fire started by
your MILF-On-A-Shelf.

16:04.247 --> 16:07.016
-Want to see some pictures
of my teenagers? -No, Karen.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.451
Look, I haven't
watered my Christmas tree

16:08.484 --> 16:10.353
for a few weeks now,
so could you watch

16:10.386 --> 16:11.854
your really long cigarette,
please?

16:11.887 --> 16:14.157
Did I tell you I went
to the mall with my daughter

16:14.190 --> 16:16.059
and an employee
thought we were sisters?

16:16.092 --> 16:18.227
Yes, many times.

16:18.261 --> 16:19.728
I don't understand.

16:19.762 --> 16:21.964
Why didn't someone
in my family save me?

16:21.997 --> 16:25.034
They went to Newport because
you wanted to be by yourself.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.069
Remember?

16:26.102 --> 16:28.404
Looks like you got
what you wanted.

16:28.437 --> 16:30.406
Oh, my God, look, it's my ghost!

16:30.439 --> 16:31.807
Not exactly.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.576
Ugh, why do I smell so bad?

16:33.609 --> 16:36.145
-Because I'm a dog fart now.
-What? Why?

16:36.179 --> 16:38.581
Because that's what happens when
you lose your Christmas spirit.

16:38.614 --> 16:40.483
You spend all of eternity
as a dog fart.

16:40.516 --> 16:43.086
-Was this in the book?
-Yes, it was an obscure chapter

16:43.119 --> 16:46.255
written during Dickens'
opium and spoiled lamb phase.

16:46.289 --> 16:47.523
But how do I...

16:47.556 --> 16:49.158
Where'd... where'd he go?

16:49.192 --> 16:51.494
Don't worry,
Brian's a 13-year-old dog.

16:51.527 --> 16:53.496
-You're around a lot.
-(farts)

16:53.529 --> 16:56.265
Please, Peter, don't lose
your Christmas spirit.

16:56.299 --> 16:57.766
It's disgusting in there.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.603
-He eats garbage
and his own poo. -(farts)

17:00.636 --> 17:03.172
Please, Peter, don't lose
your Christmas spirit.

17:03.206 --> 17:05.408
-This is no life for a person.
-(farts)

17:05.441 --> 17:07.776
Please, Peter,
he ate Lois's trash.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.945
-There's tampons in there!
-(farts)

17:09.978 --> 17:11.614
-Please, Peter.
-Keep your Christmas spirit.

17:11.647 --> 17:13.782
-Please, Peter. -This is
no life for a person.

17:13.816 --> 17:15.918
-Please, Peter.
-I'm the tampon one.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.920
No! No!

17:17.953 --> 17:20.289
No!

17:20.323 --> 17:22.258
No, please, spirits, no.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.359
No!

17:23.392 --> 17:24.960
Wh-Where am I?

17:24.993 --> 17:27.463
What day is it?

17:27.496 --> 17:31.066
All the porn girls I follow
on Instagram have Santa hats on.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.468
It must be Christmas!

17:32.501 --> 17:34.970
Merry Christmas, P.O.V. Angie!

17:35.003 --> 17:37.240
Merry Christmas,
triple-X underscore

17:37.273 --> 17:39.375
Tara Kink underscore triple-X!

17:39.408 --> 17:42.445
Merry Christmas
to all the thirst traps!

17:48.517 --> 17:49.652
Thanks, Grandpa.

17:49.685 --> 17:52.221
This Christmas is perfect,
isn't it, Mom?

17:52.255 --> 17:53.989
Almost, Meg.

17:54.022 --> 17:55.158
Almost.

17:55.191 --> 17:56.592
Yeah, it is,

17:56.625 --> 17:59.495
except every time Grandpa
bends over to get a present,

17:59.528 --> 18:01.096
his robe opens up.

18:01.130 --> 18:03.966
Let's see, I think
this is for Chris.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.001
Good God!

18:06.034 --> 18:08.671
Looks like two eggs
in an old handkerchief.

18:08.704 --> 18:11.174
Merry Christmas, everybody!

18:11.207 --> 18:13.409
-Peter! -Durd!
-Dad!

18:13.442 --> 18:15.311
Oh, Peter, you did come.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.945
Yes, Lois, I'm here,

18:16.979 --> 18:18.814
all loaded up
with Christmas spirit

18:18.847 --> 18:21.984
and a sack full of hastily
bought gifts from the CVS.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.753
For Chris, a special
People magazine look-back

18:24.787 --> 18:26.855
at Robin Williams,
'cause he killed himself.

18:26.889 --> 18:29.625
Wow, look how thick
the cover is.

18:29.658 --> 18:31.460
It's almost like a real book!

18:31.494 --> 18:34.497
For Stewie, a two-dollar
Styrofoam cooler.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.765
Awesome!
I can probably fit 16...

18:36.799 --> 18:38.267
Oh, the top blew away.

18:38.301 --> 18:40.469
For Brian,
a Rhode Island sweatshirt

18:40.503 --> 18:43.239
with both "Rhode"
and "Island" misspelled!

18:44.240 --> 18:46.209
Wow, it hurts when I put it on!

18:46.242 --> 18:48.211
And for my beloved wife,

18:48.244 --> 18:51.647
a lawn chair that was 80% off
because it's winter.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.883
Oh, Peter, I can't wait
to drink outside in this.

18:54.917 --> 18:58.887
And finally, for Meg,
a clock radio with an iPod jack

18:58.921 --> 19:01.056
for the iPods
they don't make anymore.

19:01.089 --> 19:04.727
Dad, you've never bought me
anything before.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.562
Are you sure this is for me?

19:06.595 --> 19:08.231
Of course, Meg, sweetie.

19:08.264 --> 19:10.766
It's Christmas;
everything is for you.

19:13.168 --> 19:14.903
I love you, Peter.

19:14.937 --> 19:17.973
I love you, too, Lois.

19:18.006 --> 19:20.476
And, Patrick Swayze,
thanks for helping me find

19:20.509 --> 19:21.910
the true spirit of Christmas.

19:21.944 --> 19:24.179
I wish there was some way
I could repay you.
