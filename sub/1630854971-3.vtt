WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:03.003
<i>Previously
on "Superman and Lois"...</i>

00:03.003 --> 00:04.352
I signed the divorce papers.

00:04.352 --> 00:06.397
I'll talk to you later?
- Yeah.

00:06.397 --> 00:08.051
Henry Miller?
You're supposed to be in jail.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.183
You have powers?
<i>- They granted him</i>

00:09.183 --> 00:10.706
<i>a compassionate release</i>

00:10.706 --> 00:11.924
'cause he only had
a few weeks left to live.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.535
He had
a terminal brain tumor.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.102
Did someone pressure you
to release him?

00:15.102 --> 00:16.929
- This interview's over.
- Who the hell are you?

00:16.929 --> 00:18.279
<i>Follow him--we have to
find out who he works for.</i>

00:18.279 --> 00:19.454
Did you give
Henry Miller powers?

00:19.454 --> 00:21.064
Is that an accusation?

00:21.064 --> 00:22.587
What's coming for me,
it's uncontrollable.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.546
How could you
possibly understand that?

00:24.546 --> 00:26.026
I just found out
I have cancer,

00:26.026 --> 00:27.723
and I'm really scared.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.246
<i>I'm not ready
for everything to change.</i>

00:29.246 --> 00:30.508
We are gonna
get through this together

00:30.508 --> 00:32.380
<i>as a family.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:36.427
<i>Clark!</i>

00:41.084 --> 00:42.303
<i>Clark!</i>

00:50.050 --> 00:51.399
<i>Clark!</i>

01:00.843 --> 01:02.149
<i>Clark!</i>

01:15.771 --> 01:16.946
<i>Clark!</i>

01:22.952 --> 01:26.129
<i>Where are you? Clark!</i>

01:26.129 --> 01:28.958
<i>Clark, where are you?</i>

01:28.958 --> 01:30.829
Clark!

01:30.829 --> 01:33.093
<i>Clark!</i>

01:33.093 --> 01:34.964
Clark!

01:43.755 --> 01:45.801
Clark!

01:47.368 --> 01:48.934
Clark!

01:50.501 --> 01:51.894
Lois!

01:58.683 --> 02:00.598
Clark!

02:00.598 --> 02:02.470
Lois!

02:38.027 --> 02:39.594
<i>Morning, sis.</i>

02:39.594 --> 02:42.162
Hey, Luce, you got a minute?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.425
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>

02:44.425 --> 02:45.904
<i>I know. I know.</i>

02:45.904 --> 02:47.732
<i>I haven't checked in
in a while.</i>

02:47.732 --> 02:49.038
No, it's not that.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.607
There's something
I need to tell you.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.350
A few weeks ago,
I talked to a doctor

02:56.350 --> 03:00.397
about some irritation
I had had in my breasts,

03:00.397 --> 03:03.226
and that led to a biopsy

03:03.226 --> 03:05.054
and some other tests.

03:07.099 --> 03:10.233
I found out I have stage three
inflammatory breast cancer.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.628
Stage three?

03:13.628 --> 03:15.369
Yeah, basically means
it hasn't spread

03:15.369 --> 03:16.979
to distant organs,

03:16.979 --> 03:20.722
but it may have to nearby
muscles and lymph nodes.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.857
I was shocked.

03:25.857 --> 03:28.208
There weren't any lumps.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.210
It was just
irritation and swelling.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.561
It's rare

03:33.561 --> 03:35.302
and aggressive,
and I'm gonna start

03:35.302 --> 03:37.913
chemotherapy this week,

03:37.913 --> 03:41.786
and then I'll have
surgery and radiation

03:41.786 --> 03:44.485
so that if it has spread,
we get it all.

03:44.485 --> 03:45.573
Uh-huh.

03:47.401 --> 03:50.099
Is there any Kryptonian
technology at your fortress

03:50.099 --> 03:51.927
that could help?

03:51.927 --> 03:54.799
My mother said
there's nothing she can do.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.978
I'm gonna get through this, Dad.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.067
Oh, I...

04:02.067 --> 04:04.069
I know you will, pumpkin.

04:04.069 --> 04:07.334
You are the strongest...

04:07.334 --> 04:09.466
strongest person I know.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.710
<i>Uh, where you goin'?</i>

04:35.710 --> 04:36.841
The "Gazette."

04:36.841 --> 04:38.103
Now?

04:38.103 --> 04:39.670
Yeah, Judge Regan expedited

04:39.670 --> 04:41.672
my FOIA request to look
at the sealed case files

04:41.672 --> 04:43.239
connected to Bruno Mannheim.

04:43.239 --> 04:44.936
I'm gonna get Chrissy
going through them,

04:44.936 --> 04:46.851
see what she can find.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.636
Okay, um,
you remember you have

04:48.636 --> 04:50.899
your first treatment
today, right?

04:50.899 --> 04:52.683
That's why I'm getting
Chrissy up to speed,

04:52.683 --> 04:54.729
so that she spearheads
the investigation.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.861
I'm not just gonna sit around
and wait till chemo, Clark.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.123
All right.

05:10.005 --> 05:13.225
We read that chemo
affects your appetite.

05:13.225 --> 05:14.836
Food loses its taste.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.142
So we made
all your favorites.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.409
Hi, I'd like
a double cheeseburger,

05:22.409 --> 05:23.845
a side of tater tots,

05:23.845 --> 05:25.194
a new mom--
oh, and a chocolate milkshake.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.936
- Sarah, be serious.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.243
Sarah Cortez.

05:36.118 --> 05:38.599
All right, uh, your turn.
Come on.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.038
Lana Lang.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.348
Kay.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.219
You are both in the system.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.090
We just need Sophie
and Kyle to do the same.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.702
Oh, Kyle won't be necessary.

05:57.705 --> 06:00.055
So is that thing designed
to keep bad people out

06:00.055 --> 06:01.230
or just me in?

06:01.230 --> 06:02.884
A little bit
of both right now.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.538
Come directly home
after school.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.061
Why am I the only one
that's grounded?

06:06.061 --> 06:07.671
Nat went,
and Mr. Irons isn't mad.

06:07.671 --> 06:10.413
She didn't lie about
going to a party in Metropolis.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.936
You did.
- Well, I have a dinner

06:11.936 --> 06:13.721
with Dad after school, so...

06:13.721 --> 06:15.549
unless I can't go
to that either.

06:15.549 --> 06:18.247
Come straight home after.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.206
- I mean,

06:21.206 --> 06:22.904
I love her, but sometimes--

06:22.904 --> 06:25.036
Hey, I know.
It is never easy.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.082
Trust me.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.214
You did a great job with Nat.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.651
I can't take much credit.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.392
It was mostly her mom.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.744
That's gotta be hard,

06:36.744 --> 06:40.487
what with everything
Lois is going through.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.402
I mean, you know,
I definitely feel for her,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.142
but she's not my wife.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.059
All right, just call if you
have any questions, okay?

06:48.059 --> 06:49.278
All right.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.503
What if I can't read
your handwriting?

06:56.503 --> 06:58.983
I am handing over years'
worth of an investigation.

06:58.983 --> 07:02.639
Deciphering my handwriting
is the price of admission.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.685
None of these people
were members of Intergang?

07:04.685 --> 07:06.643
Not a single one.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.776
Well, if I could tell you
one thing about Bruno Mannheim,

07:08.776 --> 07:11.126
it's that he always
covers his tracks, so...

07:11.126 --> 07:12.823
there has to be
another connection.

07:12.823 --> 07:15.130
There is one prisoner
other than Henry Miller

07:15.130 --> 07:18.438
that Judge Regan granted
compassionate release to.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.309
James Distefano,

07:20.309 --> 07:23.181
some sort of tech genius
turned elite killer

07:23.181 --> 07:26.402
who has no connection
to Mannheim either.

07:26.402 --> 07:29.231
It's like all these criminals
are in some secret society of--

07:29.231 --> 07:32.452
Wait, this release has
a physician signature, A.H.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.497
A.H.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.370
Aleister Hook.

07:38.370 --> 07:39.894
You know him?

07:39.894 --> 07:42.026
He was a doctor
at Hob's Bay Medical.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.637
Rumor is, he fixes up
Bruno's guys,

07:43.637 --> 07:44.812
but I could never prove it.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.335
Where does he work now?

07:46.335 --> 07:48.555
Um, Danner Medical.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.208
They have facilities
all over Metropolis.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.123
Let's go.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.263
Any word?

08:01.263 --> 08:04.179
I, uh,
can't get ahold of her.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.007
I'm sorry, Mr. Kent.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.009
We're going to need to give
her chair to someone else.

08:10.098 --> 08:12.143
Try not to worry--
I see this all the time

08:12.143 --> 08:13.754
with first-time patients.

08:13.754 --> 08:16.060
But she really should
reschedule her treatment

08:16.060 --> 08:17.235
as soon as possible.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.421
<i>Well, this is a bust.</i>

08:33.861 --> 08:35.515
Canceling the electricity
is always last

08:35.515 --> 08:37.865
if you have to clear out
in a hurry.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.693
So you think they just left?

08:39.693 --> 08:41.216
If they cleared
this place out,

08:41.216 --> 08:42.522
that means
they're clearing out the rest,

08:42.522 --> 08:44.872
which means
the clock is ticking.

08:46.743 --> 08:47.875
Lois, look.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.402
It's still fresh.

08:56.013 --> 08:59.321
Maybe a DNA analysis will
reveal whose blood this is.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.453
So you just happen
to have a forensic kit?

09:01.453 --> 09:03.020
It was a birthday gift
from my dad.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.241
Mine just gave me a $20 bill

09:06.241 --> 09:09.766
and a thank you card.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.769
Hey, why is Clark texting
to see if I know where you are?

09:15.772 --> 09:17.948
I missed my appointment.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.559
Appointment for what?

09:22.953 --> 09:25.086
For chemo? That's today?

09:25.086 --> 09:27.262
- He's gonna be so mad at me.
- I'm so mad at you.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.481
How could you forget
about your chemo treatment?

09:29.481 --> 09:31.745
I just got swept up
in the case.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.398
And now I'm, like, what,
your accomplice?

09:33.398 --> 09:34.748
This is not okay, Lois.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.619
It's fine.
I can reschedule.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.621
Okay, you're gonna
text Clark back right now,

09:38.621 --> 09:40.754
and then I'm gonna watch you
reschedule that appointment.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.593
Hi, Sam,
what can I do for you?

09:53.593 --> 09:55.595
Just got some stuff
for Lois.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.944
Is she upstairs?

09:56.944 --> 09:58.380
Uh, actually,

09:58.380 --> 10:01.383
she's on her way back
from an investigation.

10:01.383 --> 10:04.516
You let Lois miss chemo
for an investigation?

10:04.516 --> 10:05.648
Whoa, whoa.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.302
I didn't let her do anything.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.695
There was a break
in the case and--

10:08.695 --> 10:10.479
I don't give a damn
about the case.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.133
There's always gonna be a case.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.527
She's always gonna put it
ahead of her own health.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.878
You can't let her be
selfless right now, Clark.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.314
I'll talk to her.

10:19.314 --> 10:21.011
Once you do,
have her call me.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.187
You and I gotta
work together on this.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.321
<i>So is your mom gonna be</i>

10:26.321 --> 10:27.670
<i>feeling sick
after her treatment?</i>

10:27.670 --> 10:29.890
Everyone reacts differently
to chemo,

10:29.890 --> 10:31.718
so it's kinda hard to say.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.633
But it's definitely
gonna get worse later on.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.373
That sucks.

10:35.373 --> 10:38.028
I just wish there was
something we could do to help.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.509
What if we got her a gift?

10:40.509 --> 10:42.554
Our mom's kinda hard
to shop for.

10:42.554 --> 10:43.904
She literally
returns everything.

10:43.904 --> 10:44.992
No, it would be something

10:44.992 --> 10:46.471
that she couldn't return.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.386
What'd you have in mind?

10:48.386 --> 10:50.867
Let me check
with my dad first.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.086
Here you go.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.391
You sure
you didn't want anything?

10:53.391 --> 10:54.523
No, it's okay.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.524
I'm gonna actually get burgers

10:55.524 --> 10:57.221
with my dad later.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.875
I heard you met a guy
in Metropolis the other day.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.398
Oh, yeah, we talked,

11:00.398 --> 11:01.835
but I didn't end up
getting his number.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.011
Oh, so you just ghosted him?

11:04.011 --> 11:06.274
Candice, I'm sure
she didn't ghost him.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.189
No, it wasn't like that.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.060
I got into a fight
with some jerks from the party,

11:10.060 --> 11:13.847
so we all had to leave early.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.023
Oh, I did not
hear about that.

11:17.546 --> 11:18.547
Uh...

11:19.809 --> 11:21.463
I should get back to work.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.514
Give me a ride after?

11:29.514 --> 11:31.516
Yeah, of course.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.220
So is there anything else
you didn't tell her

11:39.220 --> 11:41.091
about the party?
- Ah, you mean Eliza?

11:41.091 --> 11:42.745
Mm-hmm.

11:42.745 --> 11:45.487
You know, I just--
I've had a lot going on, so...

11:45.487 --> 11:47.663
Can't use Mom as an excuse.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.491
Okay, it was--
it was just a kiss, though.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.406
- From your ex-girlfriend.
- Who bought you a gold chain.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.234
- That's he's still wearing.
- It was expensive.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.149
- Dude, what is wrong with you?
- Okay, okay. I get it.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.585
I will tell her about Eliza.

11:56.585 --> 11:59.066
Just stop judging me.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.937
You're right to be mad,

12:00.937 --> 12:02.983
but we had just gotten this
break in the Mannheim case.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.288
What?
Do you really think

12:04.288 --> 12:05.594
I care about Bruno Mannheim
right now?

12:05.594 --> 12:07.074
You skipped chemo, Lois.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.162
It was an honest mistake.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.425
I legitimately just forgot.

12:10.425 --> 12:13.341
Okay, well,
you can't just forget.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.299
Look, babe, the boys woke up

12:15.299 --> 12:16.692
at the crack of dawn
to make you breakfast.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.433
- I didn't ask for that.
- I know. I know.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.739
But you didn't have to.
They're worried about you,

12:19.739 --> 12:21.262
just like your dad's
worried about you.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.611
Everyone in this family
is trying to help you

12:22.611 --> 12:23.786
get through this,
but none of that matters

12:23.786 --> 12:25.309
if you don't get
your treatments.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.571
You're right,
and this doesn't excuse

12:26.571 --> 12:28.356
any of that, but you know

12:28.356 --> 12:30.575
that Bruno Mannheim
is my white whale.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.360
- Lois.
- This is the story

12:32.360 --> 12:34.275
of a lifetime;
I'm so close.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.103
Okay, but this story
is not more important

12:36.103 --> 12:38.192
than your health.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.455
- I know that.
- Do you?

12:40.455 --> 12:41.978
I promise
today was an accident.

12:41.978 --> 12:43.545
I already rescheduled
for tomorrow.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.113
Okay, great.
Then we'll go together.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.985
All right.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.508
<i>I just don't see
how it's fair.</i>

12:50.508 --> 12:51.988
Four kids went to that party,

12:51.988 --> 12:53.729
and somehow I'm the only one
that gets grounded.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.992
You're also the only one
that didn't tell anyone

12:55.992 --> 12:58.603
where you were going.
- I knew you'd take her side.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.344
Mm.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.346
No, there's no sides here.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.000
We both just want
what's best for you.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.654
Besides, your mom is still,
uh--

13:05.654 --> 13:06.960
you know,
she's still dealing with

13:06.960 --> 13:09.614
everything after the attack.

13:09.614 --> 13:10.833
How's she holding up?

13:10.833 --> 13:13.793
Still pretty rattled,
I think.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.316
Yeah, I figured as much.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.708
I was thinking about, um,

13:16.708 --> 13:18.058
calling the sheriff
and having him

13:18.058 --> 13:19.799
send a patrol car by the house.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.191
No,
you don't have to do that.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.367
We just got
a new security system put in.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.674
Why? The other one was,
like, a year old.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.502
- Mm-mm-mm.
- Sounds like somebody's

13:27.502 --> 13:29.721
just trying to make money
off all this.

13:29.721 --> 13:30.853
Oh, no, it's not like that.

13:30.853 --> 13:33.247
Mr. Irons put it in.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.378
Guy who lives
off of Main Street?

13:34.378 --> 13:35.989
That Mr. Irons?

13:35.989 --> 13:37.991
What the hell does he know
about security?

13:37.991 --> 13:39.775
Uh...

13:39.775 --> 13:41.690
I don't know.
I didn't check his résumé.

13:41.690 --> 13:44.171
I mean,
Mom just wants to be safe,

13:44.171 --> 13:46.173
and that's all that matters,

13:46.173 --> 13:48.044
right?

13:48.044 --> 13:49.089
Yeah.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.450
Hey, is that the person
who attacked you?

14:02.450 --> 14:05.540
I'm still trying to figure
out how their powers work.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.023
Freaky.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.459
Yeah.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.808
You, uh...

14:12.808 --> 14:14.505
Texted that you need
to ask me something?

14:14.505 --> 14:15.942
Oh, right.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.292
So I was talking
to Jordan and Jonathan,

14:18.292 --> 14:20.468
and they said they wanted
to do something nice for Lois,

14:20.468 --> 14:22.296
and so I was thinking,

14:22.296 --> 14:24.864
maybe we could give her
Mom's watch?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.474
Why would you do that?

14:26.474 --> 14:28.389
I mean, I can engrave
all our names on it--

14:28.389 --> 14:30.739
you know, show her that we're
rooting for her, that we care.

14:30.739 --> 14:32.567
It's kind of why I made it
in the first place.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.786
I'm sure you could find
something else to give her.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.397
But, I mean,
it's kind of perfect.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.790
She's not your mother, Nat.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.618
I know that.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.882
I just wanted
to do this for her.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.100
It's important to me.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.280
Do what you want.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.716
It's your watch.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.897
Thanks again for the ride.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.724
I know you have a lot going on.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.074
It's cool, okay?

15:01.074 --> 15:02.249
I wanted to see you.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.254
Um...

15:07.254 --> 15:08.777
you know that party

15:08.777 --> 15:10.910
that I was telling you about
that we went to?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.476
Candy Lane,

15:12.476 --> 15:14.130
why don't you get on inside?

15:14.130 --> 15:15.305
You too, Romeo.

15:15.305 --> 15:18.569
Dad, quit trying to scare us.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.615
Sorry, Mr. Pergande.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.878
Better get back to my mom.

15:24.358 --> 15:25.272
Night, Candice.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.100
Night.

15:35.151 --> 15:38.546
That's a nice truck
you got there.

15:38.546 --> 15:39.808
What'd you pay for that?

15:41.288 --> 15:42.506
Uh,

15:42.506 --> 15:45.118
I'm not sure.

15:45.118 --> 15:47.642
It was a gift.
- It's a hell of a gift.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.646
Guess you better
get back on home then.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.171
Night, Jon-Boy.

16:05.181 --> 16:06.139
<i>Clark!</i>

16:09.272 --> 16:11.840
<i>Clark!</i>

16:14.321 --> 16:15.975
<i>Clark!</i>

16:25.506 --> 16:26.986
Clark!

16:26.986 --> 16:28.378
Lois!

16:30.859 --> 16:32.513
Clark!

16:36.691 --> 16:38.388
Lois!

16:57.886 --> 16:59.888
The chair's uncomfortable.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.673
- Wanna switch?
- No, 'cause then

17:02.673 --> 17:04.588
you'll be uncomfortable.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.763
Let's switch.

17:12.596 --> 17:13.771
Better?

17:13.771 --> 17:15.556
- A little.
- Good.

17:19.734 --> 17:20.909
Clark?

17:20.909 --> 17:22.693
Hmm?

17:22.693 --> 17:23.738
What is it?

17:23.738 --> 17:24.826
Mm-mm-mm.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.264
It's a mudslide in Nepal.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.397
Go. I'll be fine.

17:30.397 --> 17:31.441
You sure?

17:43.018 --> 17:44.889
Can't believe it has
this many moving parts.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.717
And it doesn't
need a battery?

17:46.717 --> 17:47.718
Nope.

17:47.718 --> 17:48.980
Runs on kinetic energy,

17:48.980 --> 17:50.591
just like my dad's hammer.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.071
Was it super expensive?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.898
It's priceless,
because she made it.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.468
Wow,
that must've taken forever.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.427
Dad helped.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.993
Well, it's awesome

18:01.993 --> 18:03.952
that you're letting us
give this to our mom.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.434
It was Nat's decision.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.525
Is your dad cool with this?

18:11.525 --> 18:12.830
Well, it's my watch to give.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.965
This is what I'm doing with it.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.100
Come on,
we're gonna be late for school.

19:20.550 --> 19:21.551
What aren't you telling me?

19:21.551 --> 19:23.597
How did you find me?

19:23.597 --> 19:25.164
I'm Lois Lane.
I have my ways.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.730
Lois, we can't do this again.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.863
- Chrissy, listen to me.
- No. This is a problem.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.213
You have missed
two appointments in two days.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.258
Something is wrong here.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.216
I promise I will reschedule,

19:34.216 --> 19:36.436
but this is the closest
I have ever gotten,

19:36.436 --> 19:38.220
and while I am
sitting in that chair,

19:38.220 --> 19:39.700
Bruno could be covering up--

19:39.700 --> 19:40.701
And while you're
out chasing Bruno,

19:40.701 --> 19:42.224
you could be getting sicker.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.791
I am just worried
about your priorities.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.749
My priority is to get better

19:45.749 --> 19:47.186
and also to take down
Bruno Mannheim.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.013
That is not
how priorities work.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.363
You saw something.

19:52.495 --> 19:53.757
There were a couple of guys
loading trucks.

19:53.757 --> 19:54.889
I got their plates.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.195
Then we should go in there.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.153
No, Lois,
they might come back.

19:58.153 --> 20:00.068
Then we can see what
they haven't packed up yet.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.070
- They had guns.
- Then we'd better hurry.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.637
Damn it, Lois. Lois!

20:04.768 --> 20:05.856
Lois!

20:09.208 --> 20:10.774
<i>People are talking, Lana.</i>

20:10.774 --> 20:12.559
They think
there's more to the story.

20:12.559 --> 20:15.649
Look, I put out the statement
the DOD provided.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.781
I'm not even sure
what happened myself.

20:17.781 --> 20:20.219
Well, it might be a good idea
to go out there

20:20.219 --> 20:22.395
and say that.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.049
Sorry, am I interrupting?

20:25.049 --> 20:26.747
Not at all.

20:26.747 --> 20:29.053
Emily,
can we pick this up later?

20:29.053 --> 20:30.098
You sure?

20:34.972 --> 20:36.931
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.672
Just figured someone
as busy as you

20:38.672 --> 20:40.456
could use a coffee,

20:40.456 --> 20:42.806
and, uh, just wanna see
how you're holding up

20:42.806 --> 20:45.418
with, uh, all this.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.463
Yeah, it is pretty scary,

20:47.463 --> 20:50.205
but I'm fine.

20:50.205 --> 20:54.122
Been too busy
to dwell on it either way.

20:57.081 --> 20:59.823
Looks like
you beefed up security.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.609
Yeah,
it felt pretty necessary.

21:02.609 --> 21:05.307
Who set that up for you?

21:06.874 --> 21:08.789
Why are you asking?

21:08.789 --> 21:10.356
Just curious, is all.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.271
Well, Sarah mentioned
something about, I don't know,

21:12.271 --> 21:14.185
some new
security protocols and stuff.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.970
Mm-hmm,
so that's why you're here--

21:15.970 --> 21:18.102
not to bring me coffee
and see how I'm doing,

21:18.102 --> 21:19.321
but to snoop on me?

21:19.321 --> 21:21.497
That's--that's not it all, Lana.

21:21.497 --> 21:23.630
I just wanted to make sure
things were on the up-and-up.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.371
All right?
I care about you.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.677
You care about
your fragile ego.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.505
So next time
you wanna ask me something,

21:29.505 --> 21:30.898
ask it.

21:30.898 --> 21:31.942
All right?
Don't play these

21:31.942 --> 21:33.901
stupid little games.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.033
Whoever set up
my security system,

21:36.033 --> 21:37.470
that's none
of your damn business.

21:37.470 --> 21:38.906
Okay, look, Lana, I'm sorry.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.821
I didn't mean
to come in here and--

21:40.821 --> 21:43.127
I have a very busy day
ahead of me.

21:43.127 --> 21:45.652
Thanks for the coffee.

21:55.401 --> 21:58.534
<i>Thinking fast, Superman used
an abandoned freighter ship</i>

21:58.534 --> 22:01.494
<i>to airlift hundreds
of villagers to safety.</i>

22:01.494 --> 22:03.147
Excuse me,
I'm looking for my wife.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.497
She's receiving treatment here.

22:04.497 --> 22:06.194
- Name?
- Lois Lane.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.677
Ms. Lane left
before we could start.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.026
I've been trying to reach her,

22:12.026 --> 22:14.202
but she's not picking up.

22:20.034 --> 22:21.514
I know who that was.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.385
Are you trying
to get Superman mad at me?

22:23.385 --> 22:25.169
- Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, you keep saying that,

22:25.169 --> 22:26.693
and I keep worrying.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.697
What is all this
equipment for?

22:33.439 --> 22:34.701
We have to get out of here.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.180
No, no,
they're coming from there.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.921
No, I told you they had guns.

22:37.921 --> 22:40.359
- This way.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.543
Lois.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.602
This must've been what
we found at the last facility.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.125
Kay, we're in a room
full of blood.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.213
It is freezing.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.214
It sounded like there was

23:10.214 --> 23:11.302
a small militia outside.

23:11.302 --> 23:12.826
Can we please call Superman?

23:12.826 --> 23:15.089
I'd step back from the door.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.145
How long
does it usually take?

23:28.145 --> 23:30.321
Three seconds,
maybe ten if he's in space.

23:34.804 --> 23:37.328
They must've done something
to this freezer.

23:37.328 --> 23:39.766
What does that even mean?

23:42.943 --> 23:44.901
It means he's not coming.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.091
<i>Lois is missing.</i>

24:01.091 --> 24:02.223
What happened?

24:02.223 --> 24:03.354
I left her at her treatment

24:03.354 --> 24:04.834
to handle a situation in Nepal.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.662
When I got back,
they said she left early.

24:06.662 --> 24:07.968
- How could you just leave her?
- Lives were at stake.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.665
My daughter's life
is at stake!

24:09.665 --> 24:11.188
You should've been there
to make sure she didn't leave!

24:11.188 --> 24:13.147
None of this
is helpful right now.

24:13.147 --> 24:14.453
You can't hear her?
- No.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.845
She must be
somewhere insulated.

24:15.845 --> 24:17.325
All right.
I need access

24:17.325 --> 24:19.196
to your satellites
so my AI can run a scan.

24:19.196 --> 24:20.981
Don't worry.
We'll find her.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.467
Jordan. My truck's gone.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.859
I got an alert on my phone,

24:29.859 --> 24:31.165
so I went outside
after class to check.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.296
It's not there.
- What?

24:32.296 --> 24:33.515
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.995
I parked
right next to Wellnitz.

24:34.995 --> 24:36.431
Wait, you think
someone stole it?

24:36.431 --> 24:38.041
Well, I mean,
it didn't just disappear.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.174
Oh, shoot, I left
the watch in the console.

24:40.174 --> 24:41.480
We should call the sheriff.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.524
Yeah, I'm on it.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.701
Just hold up.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.834
Candice, can we, um--

24:47.834 --> 24:50.010
can we talk for a second?

24:50.010 --> 24:51.490
Well, what do you want
to say to me

24:51.490 --> 24:53.666
that you can't say
in front of them?

24:53.666 --> 24:55.276
I mean, it's just that

24:55.276 --> 24:58.018
your dad was acting
kind of weird last night.

24:58.018 --> 25:00.542
So you think that means
he stole your truck?

25:00.542 --> 25:03.763
No, but he did kinda ask
how much it cost.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.373
He was just
making conversation.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.070
It didn't seem like that.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.551
The way he asked--
- Right, and the way he looks,

25:09.551 --> 25:11.771
because we're poor
and we live in a trailer,

25:11.771 --> 25:13.773
so he must've been
planning to steal from you.

25:13.773 --> 25:15.383
Right?
He's such a horrible person.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.776
What?
No, I wasn't saying that.

25:16.776 --> 25:18.386
I can't believe
you'd even think that.

25:18.386 --> 25:20.170
Candice...

25:23.957 --> 25:25.219
Yeah,
it was definitely her dad.

25:25.219 --> 25:27.482
X-K dealer?
Yeah, it was him.

25:27.482 --> 25:31.442
It just sucks, 'cause I don't
want him to get arrested.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.270
Wait, maybe
if we find it ourselves,

25:33.270 --> 25:35.011
he doesn't have to.

25:37.623 --> 25:38.928
Still no voices.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.235
Maybe they've cleared out.

25:41.235 --> 25:42.932
I'm scared, Lois.

25:42.932 --> 25:45.413
Hey, we're gonna be okay.

25:45.413 --> 25:46.632
Says the person
who won't even go

25:46.632 --> 25:48.416
to her cancer treatment.

25:48.416 --> 25:50.549
Do we really have to talk
about that right now?

25:50.549 --> 25:51.811
Yeah, we do.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.813
Do you have any idea

25:53.813 --> 25:57.033
how hard this is to be around?

25:57.033 --> 25:58.382
You're sick, Lois,

25:58.382 --> 26:00.167
and you're refusing
to get help.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.603
I told you I'd reschedule.

26:01.603 --> 26:02.735
Yeah, that's what you said
the last time,

26:02.735 --> 26:03.910
but here we are,

26:03.910 --> 26:05.433
stuck in a death freezer instead.

26:05.433 --> 26:06.913
We had a lead.

26:06.913 --> 26:10.481
No, you had an excuse,
which you keep finding

26:10.481 --> 26:12.745
because you're scared
to get treatment.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.928
They're coming this way.

26:24.844 --> 26:27.237
What did you say
to your father last night?

26:27.237 --> 26:29.631
Hello to you too.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.634
He came by my office
asking about security systems.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.157
Did you tell him
something was going on

26:34.157 --> 26:36.333
between me and John Henry?
- No.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.597
Well, your father
certainly thought so.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.033
Well, that's his business.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.730
I can't control
what Dad thinks.

26:41.730 --> 26:45.516
Just be mindful of what
you tell him about me.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.693
Sure.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.477
Do you wanna give me,
like, a list of things

26:49.477 --> 26:50.783
that I can and cannot say?

26:50.783 --> 26:52.349
Don't be a smart-ass.

26:52.349 --> 26:54.961
Then don't make everything
about you.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.702
Wha--I'm sorry,
what did you say?

26:56.702 --> 26:58.399
I said, "Don't make
everything about you."

26:58.399 --> 27:00.140
It's selfish.
- I'm selfish?

27:00.140 --> 27:01.968
- Yeah.
- Everything I do

27:01.968 --> 27:03.709
is for you and your sister.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.188
I work my ass off.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.625
What, as the mayor?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.322
That's a job you took

27:08.322 --> 27:09.802
to make yourself
feel more important.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.020
You are so ungrateful.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.152
- I'm ungrateful?
- Yeah.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.370
- Okay.
- You know what?

27:13.370 --> 27:14.894
Go to your room.
- Yeah, go ahead.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.330
Boss everybody around
like you usually do.

27:16.330 --> 27:17.897
I said get out of my face!

27:17.897 --> 27:19.289
That's probably why
Dad cheated on you.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.819
Sarah...

27:26.819 --> 27:29.473
honey...

27:38.613 --> 27:39.919
So that whole
X-ray vision thing you got,

27:39.919 --> 27:41.398
is that gonna kick in, or...

27:41.398 --> 27:42.486
I don't know, man.

27:42.486 --> 27:44.227
I just feel like it would

27:44.227 --> 27:46.099
really come in handy
right about now.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.803
Hedy was right.
This is the place.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.239
I mean, did she mention
it was full of shady dudes

27:56.239 --> 27:57.719
with guns,
'cause I hear 'em in there.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.242
She found the truck,
didn't she?

27:59.242 --> 28:01.375
So what now,
call the sheriff?

28:01.375 --> 28:04.204
By the time she gets here,
it'll be too late.

28:04.204 --> 28:06.380
Besides, isn't this
what you've been training for?

28:06.380 --> 28:08.034
Dad would kill me.
I mean, he says

28:08.034 --> 28:09.383
I can't do
this kind of stuff alone.

28:09.383 --> 28:10.514
Well, then,
I'll do it myself.

28:10.514 --> 28:11.951
I'm getting that watch back.

28:11.951 --> 28:14.518
Fine. It's all of us.

28:14.518 --> 28:15.868
But we cannot be seen.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.434
Can't you just
speed in there,

28:17.434 --> 28:18.871
knock 'em all out?

28:18.871 --> 28:20.394
I mean, maybe,
but we'd have to take out

28:20.394 --> 28:22.570
any cameras first.

28:22.570 --> 28:25.051
No, forget that.
I have a better idea.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.532
How long can you
hold your breath?

28:31.535 --> 28:33.059
<i>Hurry up.
Let's go.</i>

28:33.059 --> 28:35.888
Get it all out of here
and back to the lab.

28:40.022 --> 28:41.720
Lois...

28:41.720 --> 28:43.112
Lane.

28:58.301 --> 29:02.001
Superman!

29:02.001 --> 29:03.219
Got her.

29:09.225 --> 29:12.141
<i>Superman!</i>

29:22.935 --> 29:24.763
Get somewhere safe
and call the DOD.

29:33.554 --> 29:36.339
Ah, I've been wanting
to try these out.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.797
What is that?

30:00.973 --> 30:02.148
Heads up--

30:32.787 --> 30:34.745
Hey, hey, hey, stop!

30:48.629 --> 30:49.717
Whoo!

30:49.717 --> 30:51.937
Hell yeah!

31:18.441 --> 31:20.269
<i>John, Superman's vitals
are failing.</i>

31:20.269 --> 31:21.749
<i>You need to get there.</i>

31:39.941 --> 31:42.291
You okay?

31:44.076 --> 31:46.078
You two are next.

32:13.801 --> 32:14.584
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

32:14.584 --> 32:15.585
You know that Mannheim

32:15.585 --> 32:17.022
or anyone from Intergang

32:17.022 --> 32:18.197
wouldn't think twice
about killing you.

32:18.197 --> 32:19.633
- Clark.
- You didn't tell me

32:19.633 --> 32:20.851
where you were.
You didn't tell me

32:20.851 --> 32:22.288
where you were going.
- Babe.

32:22.288 --> 32:23.854
And you weren't even alone, Lois.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.465
- I know.
- You brought Chrissy with you.

32:25.465 --> 32:27.467
You put her in danger.
- I know, okay?

32:27.467 --> 32:28.990
I know.
- Then why?

32:28.990 --> 32:30.557
Why would you do this,
especially right now

32:30.557 --> 32:32.646
when you're sick?
- For that reason right there.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.517
Because no matter
how many times I say it,

32:34.517 --> 32:36.998
everyone is treating me
the same way--

32:36.998 --> 32:39.218
like I'm fragile, and damn it,
I am not!

32:41.002 --> 32:43.135
Not yet, anyway,
and until I am,

32:43.135 --> 32:45.311
everyone just needs
to let me be me.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.182
Fine.

32:47.182 --> 32:50.055
Just--it doesn't feel
like you're taking this

32:50.055 --> 32:52.883
as seriously as you should be.

32:52.883 --> 32:55.364
This is all
I have thought about

32:55.364 --> 32:58.367
since the moment I found out.

32:58.367 --> 33:01.718
Any time my mind is at rest,
it pops into my head,

33:01.718 --> 33:05.461
and it is so exhausting.

33:05.461 --> 33:06.985
Let me help you.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.204
With what?
I'm the one who has to sit

33:09.204 --> 33:11.511
in that uncomfortable chair
for hours on end.

33:11.511 --> 33:14.035
I am the one whose body
is gonna be

33:14.035 --> 33:15.428
pumped full of...

33:17.212 --> 33:18.692
Just toxic drugs.

33:18.692 --> 33:21.173
I'm the one
who might lose my hair,

33:21.173 --> 33:22.348
my taste buds,

33:22.348 --> 33:24.176
my energy--me.

33:24.176 --> 33:28.049
I know.

33:28.049 --> 33:31.574
But the best way to get through
this is gonna be as a team,

33:31.574 --> 33:33.924
and that means me and you, Lois.

33:44.587 --> 33:47.547
<i>Are you okay, pumpkin?</i>

33:47.547 --> 33:49.549
I'm fine. Thanks, Dad.

33:49.549 --> 33:52.378
<i>Good, 'cause we need to talk
about the blood you found.</i>

33:52.378 --> 33:54.467
Everything at that
facility was destroyed,

33:54.467 --> 33:55.729
but we were able to run

33:55.729 --> 33:57.687
the sample
you sent over yesterday.

33:57.687 --> 33:58.949
<i>You got a match?</i>

33:58.949 --> 34:01.300
Sure did,
and it's not good news.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.220
I'll call you back.

34:09.482 --> 34:11.875
Whose blood was it?

34:13.790 --> 34:15.618
Yours.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.714
We've pushed Mr. Miller
as far as we can.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.281
If we continue,

34:26.281 --> 34:28.240
I won't be able
to resuscitate him.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.590
Mr. Mannheim wants him alive.

34:30.590 --> 34:31.852
Then what's our next step?

34:34.811 --> 34:37.597
Have your team find
someone we can push further.

34:56.877 --> 34:58.357
You sure
you put it in the console?

34:58.357 --> 35:00.837
For the hundredth time, yes.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.796
They must've rummaged
through it before we got there.

35:02.796 --> 35:05.668
Yeah, but they haven't even
taken off the plates yet.

35:05.668 --> 35:07.148
Got a visitor.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.122
Hey.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.341
What's up?

35:26.341 --> 35:27.908
I found this
in my dad's stuff,

35:27.908 --> 35:30.606
and I saw your name
engraved on the back.

35:35.655 --> 35:38.005
Guess you were right.

35:39.224 --> 35:40.312
That's it?

35:40.312 --> 35:41.574
What do you want me to say?

35:41.574 --> 35:43.315
He's my dad.
I couldn't have just...

35:46.535 --> 35:50.191
No, I'm really sorry
I got so mad at you.

35:50.191 --> 35:53.934
- Candice, where are you going?
- Come on, John.

35:53.934 --> 35:55.979
You got suspended
because I was dealing X-K.

35:55.979 --> 35:57.198
You lost football
because of it,

35:57.198 --> 35:58.678
and now my dad
stole your truck.

35:58.678 --> 36:00.506
Okay, that is not your fault,

36:00.506 --> 36:03.161
and nobody's perfect.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.771
- You seem to be.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.862
Not even close.

36:14.911 --> 36:16.696
There's something
I should tell you.

36:20.134 --> 36:24.182
I'm not sure
that there's anything I can say

36:24.182 --> 36:25.792
to make up for what I did.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.056
I am...

36:31.580 --> 36:34.975
Horrified and humiliated
by my behavior, Sarah.

36:37.978 --> 36:41.460
You know how my mother was,

36:41.460 --> 36:45.028
and I never wanna be like her.

36:45.028 --> 36:46.726
And I will do better.

36:51.905 --> 36:53.994
I love you so much, honey.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.954
And I know that it might

36:57.954 --> 36:59.913
take you some time
to forgive me...

37:02.655 --> 37:04.831
But I am just so sorry.

37:09.009 --> 37:10.750
Can we please just talk?

37:25.808 --> 37:28.985
You look like
you can use some company.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.862
You do not wanna
hear about my day.

37:38.343 --> 37:41.084
Well,
I almost died in a freezer.

37:44.914 --> 37:45.959
Hold up.
What--what?

37:48.396 --> 37:51.747
And you wanna know
what the worst part was?

37:51.747 --> 37:52.835
Lois.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.186
Yeah, she was supposed
to be at the hospital

37:56.186 --> 37:58.145
getting her cancer treatment,

37:58.145 --> 38:01.279
but instead, she was
trapped in there with me.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.932
It's like
she won't listen to anyone

38:02.932 --> 38:05.631
who's trying to help her.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.459
Yeah, I know all about that.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.029
Um,

38:13.029 --> 38:15.684
my dad, he, uh...

38:18.165 --> 38:20.167
He died of liver cancer.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.212
I'm so sorry.

38:22.212 --> 38:23.779
I didn't know.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.215
No.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.871
The thing I remember the most

38:28.871 --> 38:32.005
was just how stubborn he was.

38:32.005 --> 38:34.529
He just didn't want
to admit that he was sick.

38:36.052 --> 38:37.489
Not right up until the end.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.328
Hey, do you wanna

38:50.328 --> 38:52.025
come back to my place?

38:53.069 --> 38:54.897
And maybe watch a movie?

38:58.771 --> 39:00.250
Yeah, I think I do.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.609
Uh, maybe another time?

39:10.609 --> 39:13.263
Yeah.

39:13.263 --> 39:14.874
Oh, <i>mijita.</i>

39:16.745 --> 39:18.617
Oh, hey. You okay?

39:20.096 --> 39:22.011
It's okay.

39:33.109 --> 39:35.111
Clark,
have you seen the keys?

39:35.111 --> 39:36.548
I'm driving.

39:36.548 --> 39:37.766
Maybe on the way back,

39:37.766 --> 39:38.941
'cause I wanna
get there on time.

39:38.941 --> 39:40.900
Oh, really?

39:40.900 --> 39:42.728
Okay, well, I guess
we better get going then,

39:42.728 --> 39:43.946
shouldn't we?

39:50.736 --> 39:51.911
No one listens to me.

39:56.132 --> 40:00.267
This is a reminder
that we're here for you.

40:00.267 --> 40:01.442
It was my mom's.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.317
It's beautiful.

40:10.669 --> 40:13.149
Okay, time to use that watch.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.196
Don't wanna be late.

40:16.196 --> 40:17.763
You know,
Nat made it herself.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.634
Yeah, it has, like,
a thousand moving parts.

40:19.634 --> 40:21.462
And it's super cool.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.029
Uses the same kinetic tech
as John Henry's hammer.

40:23.029 --> 40:24.596
I still don't understand
how that works.

40:24.596 --> 40:25.771
Neither do I.

40:25.771 --> 40:27.294
But it's awesome.

40:29.209 --> 40:31.124
You were right.

40:31.124 --> 40:33.039
I know she's not my mom.

40:33.039 --> 40:35.694
It wasn't about that.

40:35.694 --> 40:37.522
I think by telling myself that,
I was trying to keep it

40:37.522 --> 40:39.698
from hurting so much.

40:39.698 --> 40:41.047
It doesn't work that way.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.050
When she was in trouble,
I realized

40:44.050 --> 40:45.791
that she's my friend.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.621
I'm just really worried
about her.

40:51.057 --> 40:52.928
Me too.

41:00.501 --> 41:01.459
Thank you.

41:03.069 --> 41:04.462
Really means a lot.

41:15.777 --> 41:17.475
Ready?

41:17.475 --> 41:19.128
I'm ready.

42:12.094 --> 42:14.053
Greg, move your head.
