In the criminal justice system,

00:02.664 --> 00:06.349
<font color=3366FF>
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.349 --> 00:07.584
<font color=3366FF>
In New York City,

00:07.584 --> 00:11.148
<font color=3366FF>
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

00:11.148 --> 00:14.164
<font color=3366FF>
of an elite squad known 
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:14.164 --> 00:16.647
<font color=3366FF>These are their stories.

00:17.058 --> 00:21.070
So now Nicole won't talk to Cynthia,
and she doesn't want me to either.

00:21.070 --> 00:24.431
And, did I mention that 
Wendy got her navel pierced?

00:24.431 --> 00:26.925
- Don't even think about it. 
- But it's so cool.

00:26.925 --> 00:29.140
Your mom said no holes, no holes.

00:29.140 --> 00:31.421
Well, wait till you hear 
what Stephanie got pierced.

00:31.421 --> 00:32.729
That's enough, Maureen.

00:32.729 --> 00:34.871
Let's let someone
 else get a word in.

00:34.976 --> 00:37.378
Kathleen, how was school?

00:37.504 --> 00:39.915
My friend Ashley quit.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.272
Quit what? 
The soccer team?

00:41.272 --> 00:44.040
No, school.

00:44.337 --> 00:47.040
She's pregnant.

00:51.019 --> 00:52.699
Honey.

01:16.375 --> 01:18.030
You gotta be Sex Crimes.

01:18.030 --> 01:19.591
- Elliot Stabler.
- Olivia Benson.

01:19.591 --> 01:20.671
You Homicide?

01:20.671 --> 01:23.365
Sorry, just Vice. D'Angelo, 31.

01:23.365 --> 01:25.019
This way.

01:25.130 --> 01:28.132
The rookie that they saddled 
me with puked himself.

01:28.132 --> 01:29.345
It's his first DOA.

01:29.345 --> 01:31.473
So I gave the kid a break 
and sent him for coffee.

01:31.473 --> 01:32.815
Who found the body?

01:32.815 --> 01:36.251
Couple of looky-loos, they veered 
off from their Frommer's Guide.

01:36.251 --> 01:37.840
They saw Times Square,

01:37.840 --> 01:40.108
the Disney Store and a bonus...

01:40.108 --> 01:41.438
a dead whore.

01:41.438 --> 01:44.617
How do you know she's a prostitute?
Did somebody ID the body already?

01:44.617 --> 01:47.426
After 30 years in Vice, 
I think I know.

01:47.426 --> 01:50.370
You get to the point where 
you can just smell 'em.

01:51.089 --> 01:52.795
We got a doozy here.

02:00.948 --> 02:03.946
Hey, you want to go check 
on your partner, we'll understand.

02:04.924 --> 02:07.343
- Whatever you say.  
- Yeah. Thanks.

02:11.829 --> 02:13.470
Do we know 
what happened here?

02:13.664 --> 02:16.457
Looks like she came 
back here willingly with a John

02:16.457 --> 02:19.438
who then turned psycho. He tries to 
asphyxiate her and bash her head in.

02:19.438 --> 02:21.674
The bag still has her
 facial impression on it.

02:21.674 --> 02:22.774
We know which one killed her?

02:22.774 --> 02:25.207
No. Only time and 
a lab work-up will tell.

02:25.207 --> 02:28.363
Also, her skirt was left hiked up, 
so we'll run a rape kit.

02:28.363 --> 02:30.383
They get anything 
from these footprints?

02:30.383 --> 02:32.709
There was a 60-man 
crew working here yesterday.

02:32.709 --> 02:36.329
But there was one print 
with blood tracked in it.

02:36.329 --> 02:38.122
Though only a partial,
 but we'll see.

02:38.122 --> 02:39.872
Can you get double 
prints on these?

02:39.872 --> 02:41.956
'Cause we could use 
a set for our bulletin board.

02:41.956 --> 02:43.648
Hey...

02:43.648 --> 02:45.568
a little respect here?

02:46.159 --> 02:50.104
Don't get your boxers 
in a twist, she's NHI.

02:51.163 --> 02:53.936
- What's NHI? 
- No humans involved.

02:53.936 --> 02:57.151
It means don't work too hard 
on this one, why sweat them?

02:57.151 --> 02:59.952
The victim was just 
a useless piece of garbage.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.751
Kinda like a cop 
who ought to retire.

1x04  Hysteria

03:48.097 --> 03:50.127
<font color=BFEFFF>ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 1999/10/11

03:54.331 --> 03:55.970
All right. Let's get started.

03:55.970 --> 03:58.648
- What do we got? 
- A black prostitute, late teens.

03:58.648 --> 04:01.793
Asphyxiated with a garbage bag, 
severe blow to the head.

04:01.793 --> 04:04.016
Sounds like a case 
homicide worked last month.

04:04.016 --> 04:07.583
Street walker named Carmel turned 
up wearing a bag near 10th Avenue.

04:07.583 --> 04:09.402
Any ID on this latest vic?

04:09.402 --> 04:12.394
No ID on the body; 
latent has no fingerprints on file.

04:12.394 --> 04:15.084
Well, maybe she 
was new to the streets.

04:15.084 --> 04:16.896
We're still waiting on the ME report.

04:16.896 --> 04:19.015
Well, while you wait, 
take her photo around,

04:19.015 --> 04:20.793
see if you can find 
a co-worker who knew her.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.883
Munch, Cassidy, you available?

04:22.883 --> 04:24.122
To do with as you will. 
After court.

04:24.122 --> 04:26.151
Right... Dr. Buzzjoy.

04:26.151 --> 04:27.897
That's an open-and-shut case.

04:27.897 --> 04:30.827
Try not to screw it up 
with your insane rambling.

04:31.035 --> 04:33.280
And stop looking at my ass.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.725
Hey, you guys, wait up, wait up.

04:36.725 --> 04:38.142
We're not Vice.

04:38.142 --> 04:39.630
We're looking for
 the man that did this.

04:39.630 --> 04:41.416
Seen this girl before?

04:42.399 --> 04:44.267
Not around here.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.372
Who'd she piss off?

04:45.372 --> 04:47.683
A guy we think might 
be targeting working girls.

04:47.683 --> 04:49.589
Anybody run into 
rough trade lately?

04:49.589 --> 04:51.652
Other than a slap and a punch?

04:51.652 --> 04:53.973
Nah, business as usual.

04:53.973 --> 04:56.324
- They're all perfect gentlemen.
- Hey, come on.

04:56.324 --> 04:59.051
This isn't a joke. You guys 
could be in real danger here.

04:59.051 --> 05:00.426
Now help us out.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.807
I had a man beat me 
up that bad once.

05:02.807 --> 05:04.909
Rose. / No, it's all right.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.502
Rose, what happened?

05:06.502 --> 05:10.604
He tied my hands and feet 
to the bedpost, started raping me.

05:10.604 --> 05:12.590
That night he came 
back with his buddies.

05:12.590 --> 05:14.481
I don't remember much after that.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.129
Can you give us a description?

05:16.129 --> 05:17.471
I could give you a group photo,

05:17.471 --> 05:20.618
if I only took the family 
album when I left home.

05:25.768 --> 05:28.161
This is Victim's Services.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.841
Call them sometime.

05:29.841 --> 05:33.209
- Yeah. Sure.
- Look, the guy that we're looking for

05:33.209 --> 05:35.377
uses a plastic garbage bag.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.879
He puts it over the girl's head.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.424
I know somebody 
that happened to.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.087
Puerto Rican named Lorinda.

05:42.087 --> 05:44.017
Can you tell us 
where we can find her?

05:44.017 --> 05:45.259
Nah.

05:45.259 --> 05:46.941
I worked Times Square with her,

05:46.941 --> 05:49.580
but I don't know where 
she went after the sweep.

05:49.714 --> 05:51.434
You might check Ninth.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.275
<font color=FF3366> 
Intersection Of 9th Avenue &
West 38th Street
Tyesday, October 5

05:54.275 --> 05:55.377
Her name is Lorinda.

05:55.377 --> 05:57.897
Puerto Rican, 5' 7",
 long dark hair?

05:57.897 --> 06:00.428
Bad red streak job, 
frizzed to the roots?

06:00.428 --> 06:02.257
Yeah, she tried to move
in with a pack of tramps

06:02.257 --> 06:04.522
after Giuliani cleaned 
up Times Square.

06:04.522 --> 06:06.636
Led to a bit of a turf war.

06:06.636 --> 06:08.601
Guess who won, sweetie?

06:08.601 --> 06:10.160
You must be very proud.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.108
So where'd you 
chase these losers off to?

06:14.460 --> 06:16.203
They were never 
heard from again.

06:16.203 --> 06:17.752
That Lorinda you 
were talking about?

06:17.752 --> 06:20.368
She tried to sneak back 
in here passing for one of us.

06:20.368 --> 06:23.338
Had to bitch-slap 
that girl till Tuesday.

06:23.799 --> 06:25.350
That's beautiful.

06:25.784 --> 06:27.122
Perfect comment on the day.

06:27.122 --> 06:29.606
- You seem a little wired. 
- It's called no sleep.

06:30.019 --> 06:32.715
Last night Kathleen informs us

06:32.715 --> 06:34.704
one of her friends is pregnant.

06:34.704 --> 06:36.048
Kathleen is 12.

06:36.048 --> 06:38.179
One of her older friends.

06:39.212 --> 06:42.180
Some girl that's on the soccer 
team that she really respects.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.697
And by older,

06:43.697 --> 06:45.780
I mean she's 14.

06:45.882 --> 06:48.160
Did you talk to her about it?

06:48.256 --> 06:49.964
She locks herself in her room.

06:49.964 --> 06:52.161
But we're gonna have a talk.

06:52.161 --> 06:53.295
Right now?

06:53.295 --> 06:55.561
No, I'm calling Children 
Services to pick up Rose.

06:55.561 --> 06:57.107
- No way she's legal. 
- Oh, come on.

06:57.107 --> 06:58.919
We promised 
we wouldn't bust 'em.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.413
She's a baby.

07:00.413 --> 07:02.142
All bets are off.

07:02.212 --> 07:04.300
Why don't we stop 
by the 31 on the way back,

07:04.300 --> 07:07.001
talk to Vice and see if they 
have anything on our victims?

07:07.251 --> 07:08.917
Quarter to 12:00,

07:08.917 --> 07:10.406
they should be at lunch.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.527
Nope. / Well,

07:12.527 --> 07:14.878
Look who's slumming at Sam's.

07:14.878 --> 07:16.633
We're working 
a case here, D'Angelo.

07:16.633 --> 07:18.936
We may have found 
a link to last night's attack.

07:18.936 --> 07:22.349
You ever run across 
a Carmel working Vice?

07:22.654 --> 07:23.741
What's a Carmel?

07:23.741 --> 07:25.849
Another DOA who was 
wearing a garbage bag.

07:25.849 --> 07:27.893
Also a prostitute.

07:28.213 --> 07:30.757
The one who bought it last month?

07:30.757 --> 07:32.881
Yeah, that one. 
You knew about that?

07:32.881 --> 07:34.211
The garbage bag case.

07:34.211 --> 07:37.316
It didn't occur to you to 
bring it up at the crime scene?

07:37.316 --> 07:40.222
No one seemed 
to want my opinion.

07:40.302 --> 07:42.397
We've got a third possible vic.

07:42.397 --> 07:45.176
A prostitute named Lorinda.
But she got away.

07:45.176 --> 07:46.348
Do you know her?

07:46.348 --> 07:47.820
I never heard of her.

07:47.820 --> 07:50.707
Let me get a quick bite 
and I'll form a search party.

07:50.995 --> 07:52.809
You busted a Lorinda...

07:52.809 --> 07:54.048
Gutierrez

07:54.048 --> 07:57.089
outside Penn Station 
my first week on the desk.

07:57.089 --> 07:58.308
And you are officer?

07:58.308 --> 07:59.571
Ridley.

07:59.571 --> 08:02.046
You Vice? / 23 years.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.483
Last two months on a desk, though.

08:06.924 --> 08:08.193
Maybe she's new.

08:08.193 --> 08:12.080
Aren't you guys late for 
a sensitivity training class?

08:19.972 --> 08:21.897
She was so young.

08:22.119 --> 08:24.554
One side of her 
face was bashed in,

08:24.554 --> 08:27.583
and the guy just stood 
there and he goes,

08:27.583 --> 08:31.468
- "No humans involved."
- Next time I hear that crap,

08:31.806 --> 08:34.187
I'm gonna bust some balls.

08:34.187 --> 08:37.232
Yeah. I'd like to bust D'Angelo's!

08:37.717 --> 08:39.787
Wait till we get our 
hands on the perp.

08:40.089 --> 08:41.658
Yeah!

08:41.658 --> 08:43.958
Petechial hemorrhaging 
inside the eyelids

08:43.958 --> 08:46.889
indicates death was 
by asphyxiation.

08:46.889 --> 08:48.280
How about the blows to the head?

08:48.280 --> 08:49.720
Overkill.

08:49.720 --> 08:53.592
He hit her so hard a piece of the 
plastic bag lodged in the wound.

08:53.592 --> 08:55.691
Our guy's pissed.

08:55.782 --> 08:56.760
He rape her?

08:56.760 --> 08:58.141
Negative.

08:58.141 --> 08:59.992
As were the drug tests.

08:59.992 --> 09:01.749
Not many clean hookers out there.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.913
Okay. Thanks.

09:03.913 --> 09:06.929
And here's something 
you don't see every day...

09:07.245 --> 09:10.566
perfect teeth from 
expensive orthodontia.

09:10.566 --> 09:14.672
Stomach contents include 
soybeans, vegetables, whole grains...

09:14.672 --> 09:16.761
a health-conscious hooker.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.758
How '90s.

09:21.887 --> 09:24.121
<font color=FF3366> 
Supreme Court
Trial Part 52
Tuesday, October 5

09:24.121 --> 09:25.493
Detective,

09:25.493 --> 09:28.533
you were on duty the day 
Ms. Weber came in alleging she'd been

09:28.533 --> 09:30.916
molested by Dr. Ott, 
is that correct?

09:30.916 --> 09:32.580
I remember it very clearly, counselor.

09:32.580 --> 09:35.707
She seemed to be see-sawing 
between anger and humiliation.

09:35.707 --> 09:37.836
Classic symptoms 
of molestation victims.

09:37.836 --> 09:39.738
Objection! State of mind!

09:39.738 --> 09:41.479
Sustained.

09:41.626 --> 09:43.830
Did she say why 
she was so upset?

09:43.830 --> 09:48.044
Yes. She said she went to Doctor Ott
to obtain a prescription for Prozac.

09:48.044 --> 09:50.766
But the good doctor, 
diagnosing her with "hysteria,"

09:50.766 --> 09:54.113
recommended an alternative 
treatment to chemical dependency.

09:54.113 --> 09:57.128
And what was that treatment?

09:57.352 --> 10:00.271
Miss Weber was told to disrobe, 
put her feet up in stirrups

10:00.271 --> 10:02.636
and try to picture David 
Hasselhoff on "Baywatch."

10:02.636 --> 10:03.916
Objection!

10:03.916 --> 10:07.681
Your Honor, this witness is not qualified
to testify on the treatment for hysteria.

10:07.681 --> 10:09.318
Actually, sir, I am.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.867
Up until 1952, hysteria 
was one of the most commonly

10:11.867 --> 10:14.202
diagnosed illnesses among women.

10:14.202 --> 10:17.445
The medical treatment 
was hysterical paroxysm.

10:17.445 --> 10:19.119
Could the witness spell that?

10:19.119 --> 10:22.051
O-R-C-A-S-M.

10:22.051 --> 10:23.758
Objection!

10:23.758 --> 10:25.744
Would it surprise you
 to learn that historically,

10:25.744 --> 10:27.622
the onus fell upon physicians

10:27.622 --> 10:30.027
to bring about 
the relief of these ladies' symptoms?

10:30.027 --> 10:34.050
Your Honor, please instruct counsel
to withhold his questions until cross.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.254
I don't mind, Your Honor.

10:36.254 --> 10:40.095
In fact, I believe the manual version of this
 "treatment" dates back to Hippocrates,

10:40.095 --> 10:42.923
and was attested to right 
up through the Middle Ages,

10:42.923 --> 10:46.550
up into the 1890s when the vibrator 
was invented to speed things along.

10:46.550 --> 10:48.636
Objection! / Sustained.

10:48.636 --> 10:52.569
Detective... is this practice 
currently against the law?

10:52.569 --> 10:56.646
Yes, and so is videotaping it.

10:58.029 --> 10:59.186
How did it go in court today?

10:59.186 --> 11:02.036
The ADA was reticent to admit it,
but I think I won the case for her.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.164
Cot a possible match 
from missing persons.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.481
Matches height and 
weight on your Jane Doe.

11:08.142 --> 11:11.155
African-American, 19, 
named Tracy Henderson.

11:11.155 --> 11:13.415
- Lives in Bronxville. 
- Missing how long?

11:14.617 --> 11:15.894
Two days.

11:16.487 --> 11:20.079
<font color=FF3366> 
Home Of John& Carol Henderson
Bronxville, New York
Tuesday, October 5

11:20.772 --> 11:22.230
Nice neighborhood.

11:22.230 --> 11:23.678
You think we're 
on the wrong track?

11:23.678 --> 11:26.629
If we're not, 
this girl fell pretty far.

11:28.968 --> 11:32.012
Yes? / I'm Detective Benson,
this is Detective Stabler.

11:32.012 --> 11:34.282
- We're here from the Special... 
- John?!

11:34.715 --> 11:36.814
Did you find Tracy?

11:37.155 --> 11:41.575
We're not sure, but we need 
to ask you a few questions.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.293
When was the last time 
you talked to your daughter?

11:44.482 --> 11:47.397
Sunday. She calls every Sunday.

11:49.223 --> 11:51.887
Are you aware of what 
your daughter does in Manhattan?

11:51.887 --> 11:53.355
Of course.

11:53.355 --> 11:57.280
She's majoring in Cultural 
Studies at Columbia. A sophomore.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.845
And she volunteers 
at a literacy center.

12:04.100 --> 12:07.410
We need for you 
to look at a photo.

12:08.256 --> 12:10.045
We don't mean to upset you,

12:10.045 --> 12:13.330
but it is rather graphic.

12:15.850 --> 12:19.103
No! No!

12:19.291 --> 12:24.136
No! God.

12:27.353 --> 12:29.092
No,

12:29.092 --> 12:30.849
How did it happen?

12:31.211 --> 12:34.532
She was found in Times Square.
 She'd been attacked.

12:35.792 --> 12:39.296
Why?! Why?

12:39.296 --> 12:42.879
That's what we're trying to find out.

12:43.665 --> 12:45.840
What?

12:47.926 --> 12:52.161
I'm sorry but your daughter 
was dressed rather provocatively.

12:52.261 --> 12:54.527
What are you saying?

12:56.233 --> 13:00.697
We have reason to believe Tracy's 
attacker was targeting prostitutes.

13:10.505 --> 13:13.200
Prostitutes?

13:13.200 --> 13:15.511
Yes, sir.

13:40.848 --> 13:42.418
So I hear notification went well.

13:42.418 --> 13:44.256
The mother, she 
actually cold-cocked you?

13:44.256 --> 13:46.744
No. / We're reassessing 
the prostitute angle.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.656
Why? Just 'cause 
she's from a good family?

13:48.656 --> 13:51.479
"Model" family. / She does 
charity work, for God's sakes.

13:51.479 --> 13:54.054
Can't see how she gets from 
there to selling it on the street.

13:54.054 --> 13:55.894
Drugs. / Not a trace.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.569
So, the question remains...

13:57.569 --> 14:01.676
what was Ms. Goody-two-shoes
doing wearing rock-my-world pumps?

14:01.676 --> 14:04.129
Not to mention the 
micro-mini and the belly shirt.

14:04.129 --> 14:09.002
It was hot that night. That's what 
I'd wear if I was going clubbing.

14:09.002 --> 14:10.487
Are you saying 
she'd be asking for it?

14:10.487 --> 14:12.837
I'd never let my daughters 
go out dressed like that.

14:12.837 --> 14:14.997
Yeah, right, just wait.

14:14.997 --> 14:17.082
What does that mean?

14:17.082 --> 14:19.174
We digress. 
Back to the dead whore.

14:19.174 --> 14:21.243
Jerk-wad, have some 
respect for the victim.

14:21.243 --> 14:23.570
I respect hookers. At least 
they earn their money up front,

14:23.570 --> 14:26.655
unlike ex-wives who get you 
with that lucrative back-end deal.

14:26.655 --> 14:29.080
So you're saying 
all women are whores?

14:29.080 --> 14:31.988
Don't be ridiculous. I don't 
know all the women in the world.

14:31.988 --> 14:33.473
Children!

14:33.978 --> 14:36.187
Okay, our possible living vic,

14:36.187 --> 14:39.328
Lorinda Gutierrez, has 
herself quite a rap sheet.

14:39.328 --> 14:41.404
Now, assuming she 
actually was attacked

14:41.404 --> 14:44.339
and this is not the figment 
of some fellow hooker's crack pipe,

14:44.339 --> 14:46.077
let's find her. 
Who wants this?

14:46.077 --> 14:48.433
- Cassidy and I would be happy... 
- I'm already on it.

14:49.183 --> 14:50.984
Now I understand the 
Hendersons informed you

14:50.984 --> 14:53.061
Tracy had a boyfriend 
they don't know much about.

14:53.061 --> 14:55.458
We're leaving right now.

14:55.458 --> 14:58.928
<font color=FF3366>
Kershaw, Naughton & DeVoy
500 Wall Street
Wednedaym October 6

14:58.928 --> 15:02.878
Call his margins then. 
Look, if he can't play with the big boys...

15:02.878 --> 15:04.980
- cut him off. 
- Dennis Caulfield?

15:04.980 --> 15:07.711
Detective Stabler. 
This is Detective Benson.

15:07.711 --> 15:10.544
We're investigating the 
murder of Tracy Henderson.

15:13.586 --> 15:16.097
- Phillip, cover my lines. 
- Sure, Dennis.

15:21.564 --> 15:22.957
When?

15:22.957 --> 15:25.065
Two nights ago.

15:25.690 --> 15:28.053
Oh my God...

15:28.322 --> 15:30.447
That's why.

15:30.658 --> 15:31.909
Why?

15:31.909 --> 15:35.699
We had tentative dinner 
plans but she didn't call.

15:35.699 --> 15:37.075
Did you try to call her?

15:37.075 --> 15:38.424
No.

15:38.424 --> 15:41.046
No, I just assumed she 
got caught up with her work.

15:41.046 --> 15:42.847
You know, she was so dedicated.

15:42.847 --> 15:45.023
What'd you end up 
doing that evening?

15:45.023 --> 15:47.134
I ended up watching the 
Yankee game with my friend Bill.

15:47.134 --> 15:48.901
Bill Griswold...

15:49.677 --> 15:51.224
I won 50 bucks.

15:51.224 --> 15:52.671
This is just a formality,

15:52.671 --> 15:55.089
but could we get 
Mr. Griswold's phone number?

15:55.263 --> 15:56.524
Of course.

16:01.463 --> 16:04.087
Oh, I forgot, he gave me this.

16:04.561 --> 16:06.632
Anyone else she might have 
been meeting that evening?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.518
Another guy?

16:08.518 --> 16:10.999
Another guy? No. 
No, she didn't date anyone else.

16:10.999 --> 16:11.864
You're sure?

16:11.864 --> 16:13.798
Absolutely.

16:13.798 --> 16:16.912
Maybe one of her friends
 from the literacy center?

16:17.011 --> 16:18.882
Out clubbing with the girls?

16:20.839 --> 16:23.910
<font color=FF3366>
Clinton Community Center
700 West 48th Street
Wednesday, October 6

16:24.031 --> 16:25.393
Have you guys had 
the talk with Kathleen yet?

16:25.393 --> 16:27.375
We tried, she freaked out again.

16:27.375 --> 16:30.528
I don't have to tell you the damage 
not dealing with it can do. / I know.

16:30.528 --> 16:32.773
I know.

16:34.211 --> 16:37.656
What? / Tracy's volunteer center...

16:38.181 --> 16:40.859
Carmel was killed 
six blocks from here.

16:43.756 --> 16:45.962
Tracy have trouble 
with anyone at the center?

16:45.962 --> 16:48.690
No. Everyone loved her.

16:48.690 --> 16:50.941
Just ask all of them.

16:50.941 --> 16:54.223
We're gonna have to 
speak with each one of them.

16:54.223 --> 16:56.608
Anyone not show up today?

16:57.676 --> 17:01.425
Travis Hall, but he's 
missed the last few classes.

17:01.425 --> 17:02.731
What's his story?

17:02.731 --> 17:04.413
He's a short-order cook.

17:04.413 --> 17:07.474
And a parolee...

17:08.106 --> 17:09.955
out of Rikers.

17:12.213 --> 17:15.897
Whatever they think 
Travis did, I think he did it.

17:15.897 --> 17:17.698
We appreciate your 
help, Mrs. Overton,

17:17.698 --> 17:19.693
but there's no need 
for you to see us all the way up.

17:19.693 --> 17:20.776
What do you think he did?

17:20.776 --> 17:23.692
Actually, it'd be best 
if you stayed here.

17:23.692 --> 17:25.435
That bad, huh?

17:26.198 --> 17:28.717
Oh man, that smell.

17:39.012 --> 17:40.692
Even with the heat!

17:40.692 --> 17:42.652
Must have been dead a week.

17:43.703 --> 17:45.532
Guess he has an alibi.

17:48.186 --> 17:49.953
Okay, let's fill this in.

17:49.953 --> 17:52.036
Carmel was dead 
prostitute number one.

17:52.036 --> 17:55.654
Lorinda, a prostitute 
attacked a year earlier, is MIA.

17:55.899 --> 17:58.507
Jury's out on Tracy, 
the honor student slash prostitute.

17:58.507 --> 18:00.028
Maybe she was 
wrong place, wrong time.

18:00.028 --> 18:02.075
Maybe the perp needs glasses.

18:02.157 --> 18:05.099
Carmel received blunt 
force trauma to the head.

18:05.099 --> 18:07.637
She was asphyxiated 
with a garbage bag,

18:07.637 --> 18:09.790
and left in a sexualized position.

18:09.790 --> 18:11.672
Cut and paste that to Tracy's.

18:11.672 --> 18:14.846
And to Lorinda's. Except 
asphyxiation was only attempted.

18:14.846 --> 18:18.774
Plus she escaped, so there was 
no body to position sexually.

18:18.774 --> 18:20.903
Plus she's not dead.

18:23.999 --> 18:26.818
Carmel was black. 
Found in an alley.

18:26.818 --> 18:28.387
Black. Construction site.

18:28.387 --> 18:30.716
Lorinda was Latina. 
Escaped from an alley.

18:30.716 --> 18:31.814
Whereabouts unknown.

18:31.814 --> 18:33.875
No luck finding the fille de joi, huh?

18:35.687 --> 18:36.918
Anything else?

18:36.918 --> 18:39.398
I got crime scene 
contamination on Carmel.

18:39.398 --> 18:42.345
Powder from latex gloves 
determined to be police issue.

18:42.345 --> 18:43.690
On three fingers.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.236
Forensic tech got sloppy?

18:45.236 --> 18:46.850
The tech was Chau.

18:46.850 --> 18:48.675
He's as meticulous as they come.

18:48.675 --> 18:51.239
So how did we get contamination?

18:52.462 --> 18:54.955
Well, I can tell you how we didn't.

19:01.244 --> 19:02.845
Why not Travis Hall?

19:02.845 --> 19:05.672
Because he OD'd 
a week before she was killed.

19:05.672 --> 19:08.769
Okay, well, you take something away,
it'd be nice if you had something to add.

19:08.769 --> 19:12.423
I'd say the key is finding Lorinda.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.000
How close did you get?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.612
The trail went cold on Ninth.

19:16.612 --> 19:19.348
Where the girls aren't actually 
girls, but boys being girls.

19:19.348 --> 19:21.756
They weren't very forthcoming 
about where they chased

19:21.756 --> 19:24.617
the female hookers 
during that he/she turf war.

19:24.617 --> 19:27.286
Oh, that's Cansevoort 
by the meat market.

19:27.959 --> 19:31.276
What? I remember it from canvassing 
during a bait-and-switch bashing.

19:31.276 --> 19:33.374
- What're you looking at?
- My man.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.287
Let's go.

19:35.848 --> 19:38.333
<font color=FF3366>
Intersection Of Gansevoort &
Greenwich Street
Wednesday, October 6

19:38.333 --> 19:40.287
Hey, maybe that's her.

19:40.766 --> 19:42.858
The elusive Lorinda Gutierrez.

19:42.858 --> 19:44.531
Hey!

19:45.106 --> 19:46.373
Hey. Come on!

19:46.373 --> 19:48.359
Wait up! / Come on 
back here! Let's go!

19:48.359 --> 19:49.802
- Stop for a second. 
- Sweetheart. Relax.

19:49.802 --> 19:51.132
It's okay. We're not Vice.

19:51.132 --> 19:53.054
- Listen up!
- We're not Vice.

19:53.054 --> 19:54.591
We're not here to bust you.

19:54.591 --> 19:56.415
We're looking for the man 
who attacked you last year.

19:56.415 --> 19:58.408
We're hoping you 
can help us with that.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.202
Come on.

20:02.469 --> 20:05.936
Freak is right in front of me.

20:05.936 --> 20:07.387
But you didn't get a look at him.

20:07.387 --> 20:09.084
Nah, 'cause, bam!

20:09.084 --> 20:10.941
He shines his light in my eyes...

20:10.941 --> 20:12.847
blinding me. Then, bam!

20:12.847 --> 20:14.769
He hits me with the flashlight.

20:14.769 --> 20:16.279
I'm woozy,

20:16.279 --> 20:20.282
then this culo puts a bag over 
my head and tries to suffocate me.

20:20.282 --> 20:21.688
At this point he's behind you.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.747
Pulling the bag tight.

20:23.747 --> 20:26.613
I'm clawing at his hands, 
but they're too smooth...

20:26.613 --> 20:28.157
'Cause he's wearing gloves.

20:28.157 --> 20:31.053
I told you already, like doctor's.

20:31.053 --> 20:32.724
He ain't letting up,

20:32.724 --> 20:35.685
so I reach back, 
grab his cojones and jerk,

20:35.685 --> 20:39.859
and I tear ass outta 
there like I'm fixing to do now.

20:40.631 --> 20:43.227
There's no description 
you can give us?

20:43.227 --> 20:47.278
Why you working this so hard?

20:48.641 --> 20:51.867
He attack somebody who matters?

20:56.996 --> 20:59.693
He's right in front of her.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.576
He blinds her, he hits her...

21:02.576 --> 21:05.671
He gets in back of her and 
pulls the bag across her face.

21:05.671 --> 21:08.859
She's clawing at his hands, 
but he's wearing gloves...

21:08.859 --> 21:12.196
doctor's. So she twists 
his cojones and takes off.

21:12.196 --> 21:13.610
Never even got 
a glimpse of the guy.

21:13.610 --> 21:15.629
She said doctor's gloves, 
meaning latex?

21:15.629 --> 21:17.005
Yeah. Why?

21:17.005 --> 21:20.408
Carmel had powder from 
latex gloves on her fingers.

21:20.408 --> 21:23.181
Yeah. But that was 
determined to be police issue.

21:23.181 --> 21:24.340
Not from the perp.

21:24.340 --> 21:26.535
Yeah, but say the attacker
 is wearing the gloves,

21:26.535 --> 21:30.192
she starts clawing at his hands,
maybe the fingers slip inside.

21:30.192 --> 21:31.833
Hel-Io!

21:34.011 --> 21:36.557
You say the doer was 
standing right in front of Lorinda?

21:36.557 --> 21:37.952
Yep.

21:38.264 --> 21:42.315
And you're sure that she shielded 
her eyes like this and not like this?

21:42.315 --> 21:44.306
I'm positive. 
We went through it a dozen times.

21:44.306 --> 21:45.903
No variation.

21:45.903 --> 21:48.213
Civilian...

21:50.987 --> 21:53.000
And who does this look like, folks?

21:53.000 --> 21:56.889
Here's a clue... 
non-gun hand, held to the side?

21:57.525 --> 21:59.406
A cop.

21:59.538 --> 22:01.278
Pow.

22:05.330 --> 22:06.416
Look, no offense,

22:06.416 --> 22:08.871
but all cops are pigs, 
far as I'm concerned.

22:08.871 --> 22:11.637
- Who's the biggest?
- That fat Irish guy.

22:11.637 --> 22:14.384
What's his name? 
Come around all grabby ass.

22:14.384 --> 22:16.927
And you know 
he don't want to pay.

22:16.927 --> 22:19.821
- O'Brien. 
- Girl, O'Brien went down.

22:19.821 --> 22:22.387
No-oo. / Yeah.
In the Midtown South Brothel Scandal.

22:22.387 --> 22:24.235
Don't you read the papers, loca?

22:24.235 --> 22:25.608
Why you always... / Girls,

22:25.608 --> 22:28.054
Yo, yo. Use your words.

22:28.054 --> 22:30.907
Use your words. / We're looking 
for a cop with a nasty temper,

22:30.907 --> 22:32.412
may have roughed you up before.

22:32.412 --> 22:34.165
Last time I got busted,

22:34.165 --> 22:37.000
the pig nearly dislocated 
my shoulder cuffing me.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.734
I wasn't even resisting!

22:38.734 --> 22:41.103
Do you remember 
this officer's name?

22:41.261 --> 22:42.444
He gonna know I said anything?

22:42.444 --> 22:44.174
If it's him, we're gonna 
get him off the street

22:44.174 --> 22:46.062
and you will never 
hear from him again.

22:47.748 --> 22:49.732
Big Italian Vice dick.

22:49.732 --> 22:52.228
Spit his toothpick right at my face...

22:52.228 --> 22:53.959
D'Angelo.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.841
- Sal D'Angelo. 
- We polled the streets.

22:59.841 --> 23:00.890
He's our lead candidate.

23:00.890 --> 23:02.816
His job is to arrest these girls.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.100
Of course they're 
gonna have a beef.

23:04.100 --> 23:07.278
We know this guy.
He's a real jerk.

23:07.278 --> 23:09.467
He was the first officer 
at the scene of Tracy's murder.

23:09.467 --> 23:11.269
He was acquainted 
with the other victims.

23:11.269 --> 23:12.707
- Make some calls.
- Already did.

23:12.707 --> 23:14.279
Abuse of his badge,

23:14.279 --> 23:16.570
bilking overtime, 
couple other slaps on the wrist.

23:16.570 --> 23:19.992
So he's not clean, but he's 
not dirty by street standards either.

23:21.832 --> 23:23.254
What precinct is he out of?

23:23.254 --> 23:24.858
The 31.

23:25.921 --> 23:27.535
Lennie Briscoe used to work the 31.

23:27.535 --> 23:28.492
Let me give him a call,

23:28.492 --> 23:32.278
see if he can shed any light
on what's not in D'Angelo's file.

23:32.278 --> 23:35.296
<font color=FF3366>
Landmark Tavern
626 11th Avenue
Wednesday, October 6

23:35.392 --> 23:37.046
When you were at the 31,

23:37.046 --> 23:40.189
did you know a cop 
named Sal D'Angelo?

23:40.250 --> 23:42.716
- The '70s are a blur. 
- Hey, tell me about it.

23:42.716 --> 23:45.000
As close as I ever 
came to time travel.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.453
The good old days, huh?

23:46.453 --> 23:48.281
I remember back in '75,

23:48.281 --> 23:49.609
I'm in Atlantic City

23:49.609 --> 23:52.260
sweating my ass off
in a room with no air conditioning,

23:52.260 --> 23:55.407
I go down to the bar, 
I order a double vodka on the rocks.

23:55.407 --> 23:57.331
I tip it back, next thing I know,

23:57.331 --> 23:59.650
I'm eye-to-eye with 
a worm in a tequila bottle.

23:59.650 --> 24:01.657
I look around, 
it's not Atlantic City.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.212
It's Mexico.

24:03.212 --> 24:06.728
Me too. Only I wake up eye-to-eye 
with my service revolver,

24:06.728 --> 24:08.403
crying like a baby.

24:08.403 --> 24:11.650
Yet somehow we managed to 
stay a step ahead of our squads.

24:11.650 --> 24:14.664
A bunch of wiseguys like D'Angelo.

24:14.664 --> 24:17.375
D'Angelo, what a piece of work.

24:17.375 --> 24:20.837
Last year, PBA Golf 
Tournament, he's there.

24:20.837 --> 24:23.832
Same little snot. 
Loud, obnoxious.

24:23.832 --> 24:25.632
Always picking his teeth.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.676
He threw a club on the 13th.

24:27.676 --> 24:29.045
So he has a temper.

24:29.045 --> 24:30.309
Excessive?

24:30.309 --> 24:32.789
Naw, it's mostly bluster. I mean,

24:32.789 --> 24:34.558
he and his partner came in second.

24:34.558 --> 24:36.599
D'Angelo bought a round of drinks.

24:36.599 --> 24:39.015
See, you didn't kill as many 
brain-cells as you thought.

24:39.015 --> 24:40.928
You haven't lost a step either.

24:40.928 --> 24:44.576
You still know how to 
interrogate the hell out of a guy.

24:44.644 --> 24:46.284
Look, Lennie, the reason I'm asking,

24:46.284 --> 24:49.789
we're looking for a Vice cop 
with a serious cruel streak.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.812
D'Angelo's a bastard.

24:51.812 --> 24:53.746
Come on, so are you. So am I.

24:53.746 --> 24:56.023
We're all bastards.

24:56.023 --> 24:59.535
But his partner, 
now there's a real wacko.

24:59.535 --> 25:00.656
How so?

25:00.656 --> 25:01.995
That same day...

25:01.995 --> 25:04.885
this guy sinks a 45-foot putt.

25:04.885 --> 25:07.191
Now, everybody goes crazy.
They're yelling,

25:07.191 --> 25:09.593
"Ripley's Believe It or Not."

25:09.593 --> 25:11.792
No Ridley, that was his name.

25:11.792 --> 25:13.642
Ridley... he was very strange.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.235
Well, what's so strange 
about a lucky putt?

25:15.235 --> 25:18.513
Not the putt. 
The guy's reaction to it.

25:18.513 --> 25:21.677
When that ball fell in the cup, 
everybody went nuts.

25:21.677 --> 25:23.613
Ridley doesn't even crack a smile.

25:23.613 --> 25:25.704
Like he's got ice water in his veins.

25:25.704 --> 25:28.915
So he's cool under pressure. 
We give cops commendations for that.

25:28.915 --> 25:33.362
No. But the very next hole,
he slices one into the woods.

25:33.362 --> 25:35.799
He goes nuts... 
attacks a ball washer.

25:35.799 --> 25:37.497
Completely destroys it.

25:37.497 --> 25:38.902
Something to drink?

25:38.902 --> 25:40.423
I'll have a Perrier.

25:40.423 --> 25:42.461
You still drinking that French swill?

25:42.461 --> 25:44.427
Let me have a Pellegrino.

25:44.427 --> 25:46.787
You always gotta trump me, Lennie.

25:48.426 --> 25:49.985
Elliot,

25:49.985 --> 25:51.412
anything new on D'Angelo?

25:51.412 --> 25:52.720
We're spinning our wheels here.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.427
Briscoe give you anything?

25:54.427 --> 25:55.684
Yeah.

25:55.684 --> 25:59.012
I want you to check out 
an officer named Ridley.

25:59.012 --> 26:00.608
Who?

26:01.504 --> 26:04.055
Ridley, Peter Francis.

26:04.055 --> 26:06.422
This is from IAD. 
How'd you get this?

26:06.422 --> 26:08.095
Don't ask, don't tell.

26:09.322 --> 26:12.181
Look at this. Two assault 
complaints by prostitutes.

26:12.181 --> 26:13.425
Both dropped.

26:13.425 --> 26:16.855
Domestic abuse complaint 
filed by his ex-wife... also dropped.

26:16.855 --> 26:19.034
Wait till you get a load 
of the psych report in the back.

26:19.034 --> 26:20.103
Red flags?

26:20.103 --> 26:21.649
Looks like China.

26:21.887 --> 26:23.742
I want you to pull 
everything you can on this guy.

26:23.742 --> 26:25.377
Question anybody 
he ever worked with.

26:25.377 --> 26:29.357
If you can, go all the way back
to the first sandbox he ever farted in.

26:29.827 --> 26:31.667
Which is?

26:31.847 --> 26:33.106
Kew Gardens.

26:33.106 --> 26:36.213
<font color=FF3366>
Kew Gardens
Queens, New York
Thuesday, October 7

26:37.168 --> 26:38.434
The kid was a nightmare.

26:38.434 --> 26:39.992
Things weren't easy for that boy.

26:39.992 --> 26:41.824
How can you stand 
there and defend him?

26:41.824 --> 26:43.939
Poor thing, with that mother of his.

26:43.939 --> 26:45.219
What about her?

26:45.219 --> 26:46.871
Saltines...

26:46.871 --> 26:47.936
that was the sign.

26:47.936 --> 26:50.780
If the crackers were outside 
the door, he wasn't to come in.

26:50.780 --> 26:52.881
That meant she was 
in there with a customer.

26:52.881 --> 26:54.344
You know, a John.

26:54.344 --> 26:56.816
He'd sit outside the 
door all night sometimes.

26:56.816 --> 26:59.005
In the cold, in the rain.

26:59.005 --> 27:01.338
He could hear 
the goings-on in there.

27:01.338 --> 27:04.163
Saltines for dinner, imagine.

27:06.281 --> 27:07.320
This is gonna take weeks.

27:07.320 --> 27:11.128
- I know. Ridley moved around a lot. 
- We gotta get a better system.

27:11.128 --> 27:13.456
Okay. Let me pull 
the assaults in his precincts.

27:13.456 --> 27:15.641
You pull his arrest records. / Yeah.

27:17.025 --> 27:18.978
I understand how Ridley 
could grow to hate his mother.

27:18.978 --> 27:20.777
But to get to this point?

27:20.777 --> 27:24.751
Frustration, resentment, self-pity.

27:24.751 --> 27:27.651
I mean, the guy stayed 
a low-level officer for 31 years.

27:27.651 --> 27:29.036
Yeah.

27:29.208 --> 27:31.438
Probably looking at forced 
retirement in a year or two,

27:31.438 --> 27:33.000
never having made his mark.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.492
His wife left him a bitter, 
woman-hating loner.

27:36.492 --> 27:38.072
That'd do it. That's a trigger.

27:38.072 --> 27:39.891
Okay. These are them.

27:40.757 --> 27:43.167
And that's the trigger 
for me. I'm gone.

27:43.391 --> 27:45.835
I gotta kick soccer balls at Kathleen.

27:45.835 --> 27:47.588
That should get her to talk.

27:47.588 --> 27:50.990
I don't even know if she's gonna 
show up. She's been in hiding.

27:51.072 --> 27:53.092
She's goalie, huh? / Yeah.

27:53.092 --> 27:56.246
Make sure you stress how aggressively 
she needs to protect the goal.

27:58.722 --> 28:00.161
You coming?

28:00.161 --> 28:01.560
No, I'm gonna stay 
here for a little bit,

28:01.560 --> 28:03.099
you go ahead. / Okay.

28:03.219 --> 28:04.321
I'm taking the eggroll.

28:04.321 --> 28:05.729
All right.

28:22.035 --> 28:23.421
You didn't come out again, honey.

28:23.421 --> 28:24.913
So?

28:25.534 --> 28:27.372
So one ball can change the game.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.529
It's like... it's like life.

28:30.906 --> 28:33.024
When I get close to you, 
just come on out.

28:33.024 --> 28:34.424
Cut off my angle.

28:34.424 --> 28:36.307
Okay? Let's try it again.

28:38.569 --> 28:40.418
Okay, Come on out. Come on out.

28:41.597 --> 28:43.296
Thanks, that was great advice.

28:43.296 --> 28:45.303
Honey, you did great. 
You did great.

28:45.303 --> 28:49.896
It's just that the players in 
this game, they know a lot of tricks.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.497
Never commit until you know 
where they're coming from.

28:55.497 --> 28:58.431
And even then, 
you just gotta be careful.

28:59.194 --> 29:02.510
You understand? / Whatever.

29:03.007 --> 29:05.027
Good. Okay. That's good.

29:05.027 --> 29:06.088
All right.

29:06.088 --> 29:09.404
Because they'll be 
attacking you from every angle.

29:13.388 --> 29:16.519
Just guard it with 
your life, sweetie.

29:16.519 --> 29:18.360
Oh, boy.

29:18.360 --> 29:19.956
Okay.

29:21.855 --> 29:23.588
Come on, kick it back.

29:24.359 --> 29:28.027
Dad, I'm a virgin, okay?!

29:31.122 --> 29:33.186
Okay.

29:38.608 --> 29:40.362
Olivia?

29:40.910 --> 29:42.630
Hey.

29:42.992 --> 29:44.929
Hey. / Hey.

29:46.745 --> 29:48.685
How late did you work last night?

29:49.064 --> 29:50.569
Is it morning?

29:50.569 --> 29:51.789
What were you doing?

29:51.789 --> 29:54.457
Cross-referencing 
attacks on prostitutes

29:54.457 --> 29:57.254
with precincts 
where Ridley worked.

29:58.192 --> 29:59.915
How far'd you go back?

30:00.054 --> 30:01.978
29, 30 years.

30:02.689 --> 30:04.764
Okay, what do you got for me?

30:05.447 --> 30:08.281
Take a look and
 tell me what you think.

30:12.433 --> 30:14.334
See a pattern?

30:16.813 --> 30:19.288
It's like a string of paper dolls.

30:26.995 --> 30:28.709
Detectives.

30:28.866 --> 30:30.511
Officer Ridley,

30:30.511 --> 30:33.092
we're gonna need you to 
come down to the precinct with us.

30:33.201 --> 30:35.666
I know what this is about.

30:37.325 --> 30:39.807
I won the policeman's raffle, right?

30:43.158 --> 30:45.762
So, let's do it.

30:45.762 --> 30:47.785
I'm gonna need your weapon, sir.

30:53.137 --> 30:54.489
Second weapon!

31:09.657 --> 31:11.813
So how goes the 
psychological warfare?

31:11.813 --> 31:13.521
It's working...

31:13.521 --> 31:15.066
on us at least.

31:15.066 --> 31:17.142
How long has he been in there?

31:18.316 --> 31:19.898
45 minutes.

31:22.855 --> 31:26.368
He acts as if he's looking 
at a Van Gogh exhibit.

31:28.202 --> 31:29.790
He's ready.

31:38.011 --> 31:41.249
That's some nice police work.

31:41.995 --> 31:44.528
Only took you 31 years.

31:47.342 --> 31:51.464
Can you believe not one of those 
morons in Vice ever picked up on it?

31:57.552 --> 31:59.285
<font color=BFEFFF>
The irony is...

32:00.094 --> 32:03.206
I almost had it out of my system.

32:03.347 --> 32:05.678
The need to cleanse?

32:06.393 --> 32:08.548
I even let one get away last year.

32:08.548 --> 32:09.584
Yeah,

32:09.584 --> 32:12.009
after she nailed you in the gonads.

32:21.992 --> 32:25.235
That night I had a cold,

32:25.235 --> 32:27.316
almost didn't go out.

32:27.316 --> 32:29.151
<font color=BFEFFF>Glad I did though.

32:29.700 --> 32:33.029
<font color=BFEFFF>
She was a particularly 
rancid piece of meat.

32:33.029 --> 32:34.974
<font color=BFEFFF>
$20 a pop.

32:35.398 --> 32:38.432
Of course, 
those were 1979 dollars.

32:40.491 --> 32:43.994
And this little junkie whore,

32:44.411 --> 32:47.626
weighed about 80 pounds.

32:52.486 --> 32:55.625
I remember pulling 
the bag so tight,

32:55.934 --> 32:59.198
it lifted her clear off the ground.

33:09.332 --> 33:11.170
I know the drill.

33:12.896 --> 33:15.119
But you gave me 
too much credit.

33:15.195 --> 33:17.743
What's that supposed to mean?

33:23.381 --> 33:25.574
It's not mine.

33:27.816 --> 33:29.994
It's name is Tracy Henderson.

33:29.994 --> 33:31.444
Don't jerk us around, Ridley.

33:31.444 --> 33:34.510
18 counts gets you 
the same lethal injection as 19.

33:34.510 --> 33:35.707
You know that.

33:35.707 --> 33:37.669
Yes. I know.

33:39.591 --> 33:44.429
That's why I want my record
accurately documented...

33:44.990 --> 33:47.562
for posterity.

34:02.228 --> 34:03.794
Okay.

34:03.794 --> 34:06.495
You took the FBI seminar 
on pattern killers, right?

34:06.495 --> 34:08.359
MO and signatures. / Sure.

34:08.359 --> 34:10.199
MO is how a perpetrator operates;

34:10.199 --> 34:13.810
signature is what distinguishes 
him from others with similar MO's.

34:13.810 --> 34:16.175
He didn't kill Tracy Henderson.

34:16.367 --> 34:17.911
Why? Because he says so?

34:17.911 --> 34:20.311
Because he's a pattern killer.

34:20.311 --> 34:22.786
All his vics were 
found in remote areas.

34:22.786 --> 34:25.614
All of them were placed 
very carefully into position.

34:25.614 --> 34:27.507
He has them holding 
hands for God's sake.

34:27.507 --> 34:29.998
What about the bag over her head?

34:30.375 --> 34:31.716
The crushed skull?

34:31.716 --> 34:33.234
I don't know.

34:33.234 --> 34:34.641
Coincidence?

34:34.641 --> 34:36.405
Copycat?

34:36.775 --> 34:38.347
No...

34:40.068 --> 34:43.183
A first-timer. 
Impulsive, young.

34:43.183 --> 34:44.355
All right.

34:44.355 --> 34:46.643
Young. Impulsive.

34:46.643 --> 34:49.976
My gut tells me 
the killer knew Tracy.

34:49.976 --> 34:52.735

Special Victims Unit
Squadroom
Friday, October 8

34:55.318 --> 34:56.583
Did you call the Hendersons?

34:56.583 --> 34:59.213
- Next on my list.
- Cross it off.

34:59.213 --> 35:00.647
The father's here.

35:01.366 --> 35:03.212
Detective.

35:04.361 --> 35:06.545
I owe you an apology.

35:06.611 --> 35:08.439
My wife was in shock and

35:08.439 --> 35:10.513
she feels terrible.

35:13.082 --> 35:16.457
We're very grateful to 
you for catching Tracy's killer.

35:16.457 --> 35:18.751
And we wanted to thank you.

35:21.107 --> 35:22.724
Mr. Henderson, I am sorry,

35:22.724 --> 35:27.650
but the man we have in custody 
is not your daughter's killer.

35:27.650 --> 35:29.148
But in the news, in the papers,

35:29.148 --> 35:30.916
it was the way Tracy...

35:30.916 --> 35:32.674
you said it was the guy.

35:32.674 --> 35:35.638
We intended to 
call you this morning.

35:47.972 --> 35:49.501
Mr. Henderson, 
I give you my word,

35:49.501 --> 35:53.115
we are gonna find Tracy's killer.

35:55.243 --> 35:56.974
Okay.

35:56.974 --> 35:58.634
All right. All right.

36:02.220 --> 36:04.701
- God, do I feel crappy. 
- It's not your fault.

36:06.926 --> 36:09.039
18 out of 19, 
you think we'd be happy.

36:09.039 --> 36:11.508
Okay, so now we go 
for a perfect record.

36:11.508 --> 36:14.374
Did you ever find out 
why Tracy was in Times Square?

36:14.374 --> 36:17.105
All we know is she had
tentative plans with her boyfriend,

36:17.105 --> 36:18.414
but she never called him.

36:18.414 --> 36:21.685
Now you confirmed that 
against her phone logs, right?

36:21.685 --> 36:22.755
We pulled them, but...

36:22.755 --> 36:25.236
We got diverted by 
the Ridley investigation.

36:25.236 --> 36:27.333
Okay. So, now you're diverted back.

36:27.333 --> 36:28.903
Dennis' alibi checked.

36:28.903 --> 36:31.265
If Tracy was leading a double life,

36:31.265 --> 36:33.517
the boyfriend would 
be the one to know.

36:33.517 --> 36:37.541
Did it seem like maybe 
he was holding something back?

36:37.664 --> 36:40.215
I didn't get that from him. 
He was very forthcoming.

36:40.215 --> 36:44.190
- Very helpful. 
- Maybe too helpful?

36:44.190 --> 36:45.985
He was pretty quick with that card.

36:45.985 --> 36:50.350
His alibi's business card. 
Right in his pocket. Just kinda...

36:50.885 --> 36:53.611
He was watching the 
game with his best friend.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.827
I know my best 
friend's number by heart.

37:00.866 --> 37:03.783
You know what they call 
an accomplice in prison, Billy?

37:03.783 --> 37:05.565
Bunkmate.

37:05.565 --> 37:09.951
25-to-life is a serious 
downgrading from the old lifestyle.

37:10.097 --> 37:11.194
Okay,

37:11.194 --> 37:14.617
Dennis' real girlfriend
is a buyer for Prada from Scarsdale.

37:14.617 --> 37:16.023
They're probably gonna get married.

37:16.023 --> 37:17.423
How'd Tracy feel about that?

37:17.423 --> 37:19.077
Dennis just wanted
a little strange

37:19.077 --> 37:20.812
before he settled down.

37:20.812 --> 37:23.319
He saw Tracy at 
a club one night. Very hot.

37:23.319 --> 37:26.105
Every guy wants her, 
Dennis get her.

37:26.105 --> 37:28.568
The problem is, the package 
doesn't match the wrapping.

37:28.568 --> 37:30.683
She's very inexperienced.

37:30.897 --> 37:33.713
A virgin? / It was even 
her first glass of wine.

37:33.713 --> 37:36.674
She wakes up the next morning with 
a big hangover and in love with Dennis.

37:36.674 --> 37:40.593
So poor Dennis didn't get 
the jungle fever he was looking for.

37:40.593 --> 37:42.540
More like iced mocha.

37:42.540 --> 37:43.820
So what happened that night?

37:43.820 --> 37:45.800
She calls him up, 
wants to go dancing.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.398
Says she's even gonna 
wear something wild for once.

37:48.398 --> 37:49.984
But Dennis stood her up

37:49.984 --> 37:53.313
and went home alone.
That's why he asked me to lie for him.

37:54.703 --> 37:56.613
He's my friend.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.116
So get a new one.

38:00.740 --> 38:03.240
There's nothing that links 
the boyfriend to Tracy's crime scene.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.064
There's gotta be something. 
I'm not gonna question him

38:05.064 --> 38:07.287
until we have something 
concrete to hold over him.

38:07.287 --> 38:09.558
Our luck, his lawyer's 
even slicker than he is.

38:09.558 --> 38:11.793
Let's go over it again. 
What are we not seeing here?

38:11.793 --> 38:13.017
What is there to see?

38:13.017 --> 38:16.464
We have no hair, 
no fibers, no prints.

38:17.558 --> 38:19.253
At the crime scene...

38:19.253 --> 38:21.016
they had a partial footprint.

Forensics Laboratory
One Police Plaza
Friday, October 8

38:26.020 --> 38:28.366
It was the vic's blood
tracked in the shoe print.

38:28.366 --> 38:29.779
What have you got on the shoe?

38:29.779 --> 38:32.743
Size 11-C, exotic Italian.

38:33.128 --> 38:35.126
Valleti Brothers.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.959
You mean the Valenti Brothers?

38:37.959 --> 38:39.964
Yes, I do.

38:40.132 --> 38:41.491
How'd you know that?

38:41.491 --> 38:43.401
They run an ad every 
week in "The Times,"

38:43.401 --> 38:46.859
highlighting the fact that they're 
exclusively available at one location.

38:48.633 --> 38:51.394
In that size, we've 
sold maybe a dozen pair.

38:51.394 --> 38:52.666
They're new this fall.

38:52.666 --> 38:53.905
They're beautiful.

38:53.905 --> 38:56.772
They're $820 a pair.

38:56.881 --> 38:58.215
Are you in the market?

38:58.215 --> 39:01.097
Yes, I am.
For those 12 receipts.

39:01.097 --> 39:03.205
Would you pull them for us?

39:08.211 --> 39:09.923
You wanna know 
what kills me?

39:09.923 --> 39:12.206
Is, even if we prove 
that he owned the shoes,

39:12.206 --> 39:14.072
he's still had plenty 
of time to ditch them.

39:14.072 --> 39:18.506
Trust me, that jerk did 
not throw away $800 shoes.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.313
This is what we got from his place.

39:22.313 --> 39:24.893
This kid's a closet lmelda Marcos.

39:24.893 --> 39:27.363
We've got wingtips, 
tassels, white bucks.

39:27.363 --> 39:29.462
Everything but the ugly-ass 
shoes you're looking for.

39:29.462 --> 39:30.978
Damn it.

39:31.803 --> 39:34.284
Did we cover 
everything in that warrant?

39:34.284 --> 39:37.132
We searched his office, 
we searched his gym locker.

39:37.132 --> 39:39.020
We searched everything.

39:39.257 --> 39:41.793
Everything but the 
house he grew up in.

39:42.332 --> 39:45.129
Current voters' registration card.

39:46.298 --> 39:48.362
It's still his legal address.

Home Of Charles & Evelyn Caulfield
Westchester, New York
Friday, October 8

39:51.696 --> 39:54.111
That was taken 
spring break in Vermont.

39:54.111 --> 39:55.420
She loved to ski.

39:55.420 --> 39:56.817
She's quite pretty.

39:56.817 --> 39:58.272
Not any more.

39:58.272 --> 40:01.381
You couldn't stomach the 
photos we got from the crime scene.

40:01.381 --> 40:03.046
Why are you telling us this?

40:03.046 --> 40:05.896
Because she was 
your son's dirty little secret.

40:05.896 --> 40:09.602
Although she was a lovely, decent girl who 
came from an affluent family, a lot like yours.

40:09.602 --> 40:11.829
Except she was black.

40:11.829 --> 40:14.006
Would you have had 
a problem with that?

40:14.307 --> 40:15.667
No, of course not.

40:15.667 --> 40:17.116
But he never mentioned her to you?

40:17.116 --> 40:18.683
This is insane.

40:18.683 --> 40:20.584
You don't know our son.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.018
Do you?

40:22.018 --> 40:23.539
What are you doing here?

40:23.539 --> 40:25.619
You mind if we take 
a look in your bag?

40:25.619 --> 40:27.179
Yeah, I do mind.

40:27.466 --> 40:30.157
- Too bad. 
- Why did you kill her, Dennis?

40:30.555 --> 40:32.150
Did she make problems 
with your real girlfriend?

40:32.150 --> 40:34.911
Maybe he took her 
out for one last fling.

40:34.911 --> 40:36.451
Perhaps I'd better call my lawyer.

40:36.451 --> 40:37.857
Perhaps you should.

40:37.857 --> 40:41.818
You took her out for a pizza 
and a quickie outside in the open?

40:41.818 --> 40:43.735
That's pretty kinky.

40:44.565 --> 40:47.508
She refused you.

40:47.819 --> 40:50.208
Your friend Griswold 
said she's kind of square.

40:50.208 --> 40:51.995
That's so frustrating.

40:51.995 --> 40:54.646
So, you got so pissed 
off when she refused you,

40:54.646 --> 40:56.526
you got a little 
too rough, didn't you?

40:56.526 --> 40:58.348
Try and shake 
some sense into her?

40:58.348 --> 41:00.523
And when she didn't get up,

41:00.523 --> 41:02.040
you panicked

41:02.040 --> 41:03.597
and dragged her into the alley.

41:03.597 --> 41:06.285
"Ah, what am 
I going to do now, huh?

41:06.494 --> 41:09.799
Well, whatever,
I'll just dump her body and run.

41:10.641 --> 41:12.829
I'll wake up the 
next morning, go to work,

41:12.829 --> 41:16.184
pretend nothing ever happened
and maybe it'll actually be that way."

41:16.184 --> 41:18.060
No. / No? / No!

41:18.060 --> 41:19.569
But something did happen, Dennis.

41:19.569 --> 41:21.425
I have no idea what
they're talking about, Mother.

41:21.425 --> 41:22.723
Really?

41:22.723 --> 41:24.891
Then why didn't you mention her?

41:27.120 --> 41:29.565
- Well, I was going to, but you...
- Oh my God...

41:31.481 --> 41:33.766
he's wearing them.

41:40.336 --> 41:43.047
Nice shoes.
