WEBVTT

00:00.239 --> 00:02.532
Why am I tightly rolling my clothes?

00:02.632 --> 00:04.374
It's the most efficient way to pack.

00:04.443 --> 00:05.709
And I'm getting ready

00:05.777 --> 00:07.944
for my upcoming Catholic
youth retreat weekend.

00:08.013 --> 00:10.080
It's just as awesome as it sounds.

00:10.148 --> 00:11.280
Hey, Kenny, you got room

00:11.349 --> 00:12.782
for duct tape, Silly
String, and saran wrap?

00:12.851 --> 00:14.050
They always check my bag.

00:14.119 --> 00:16.552
They say it's random,
but it's profiling.

00:16.622 --> 00:17.854
It's not profiling.

00:17.923 --> 00:20.289
You saran-wrapped six
kids to a pole last year.

00:20.358 --> 00:21.491
Yeah, and it would have been seven.

00:21.559 --> 00:24.094
Kevin Farkus is a slippery little fella.

00:24.162 --> 00:25.461
Hey.

00:25.530 --> 00:27.430
If you weren't my brothers
and wanted to make out with me,

00:27.499 --> 00:29.765
would you prefer root
beer or bubble gum lips?

00:29.834 --> 00:30.799
- Root beer.
- Why?

00:30.868 --> 00:32.228
Well, for me, this weekend's about

00:32.237 --> 00:33.936
finally getting my first real kiss.

00:34.005 --> 00:35.505
I'm four months behind my schedule,

00:35.573 --> 00:37.607
so I'm gonna leave these behind.

00:37.675 --> 00:41.443
And put these on.

00:41.512 --> 00:43.178
Are those slightly thicker?

00:43.247 --> 00:44.680
You bet your ass they are.

00:44.749 --> 00:48.316
Ugh, you guys, it is not
about hooking up or pranking.

00:48.385 --> 00:49.752
It is about getting in touch with

00:49.820 --> 00:51.586
what being Catholic means to you,

00:51.656 --> 00:54.023
and, uh, not to brag,
but there is a good chance

00:54.091 --> 00:55.858
that I will be named Faith Leader.

00:55.926 --> 00:58.660
Aww. He thinks he's bragging.

00:58.728 --> 01:00.629
Okay, you guys, being Faith Leader

01:00.697 --> 01:02.564
is the next step in my evolution.

01:02.633 --> 01:05.167
I'm head altar boy, class treasurer,

01:05.235 --> 01:08.203
elks club teen of the
month October 2014.

01:08.272 --> 01:09.404
It's like when Rita Moreno

01:09.473 --> 01:12.840
won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.

01:12.909 --> 01:14.876
I need the EGOT.

01:14.944 --> 01:17.344
I want to be the Rita Moreno
of high-school leader...

01:22.786 --> 01:24.652
That was good.

01:24.721 --> 01:26.888
Get it out of your system now.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.890
Don't forget to call
us if you need anything.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.598
That's right. And
everybody has the number

01:30.660 --> 01:31.758
to my basement landline, right?

01:31.827 --> 01:32.384
- What?
- No.

01:32.409 --> 01:33.971
What's a landline?

01:33.972 --> 01:36.415
Oh, forget it. I'm just trying
to establish my independence.

01:36.416 --> 01:38.365
We are gonna miss you all so much.

01:38.434 --> 01:39.700
That's right. Love you. Mwah!

01:39.768 --> 01:40.528
- See you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:40.570 --> 01:41.669
- Love you.
- Bye!

01:41.737 --> 01:43.370
- Love you. No.
- Love you. No, joking.

01:43.439 --> 01:45.206
Wow. It's kind of like the first day

01:45.274 --> 01:46.754
of the rest of our single lives, huh?

01:46.775 --> 01:47.774
- Mm.
- Any plans?

01:47.843 --> 01:49.209
Oh, yeah. So many.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.443
Mm.

01:50.512 --> 01:52.378
The tough part is cramming
it all into one weekend.

01:52.447 --> 01:54.081
Oh, tell me about it.

01:54.149 --> 01:55.648
I'm like, "Slow down, Brain.

01:55.718 --> 01:57.617
You know, you're gonna explode
thinking about all your plans."

01:57.686 --> 01:59.152
Yeah.

02:02.046 --> 02:03.723
Well, I'm gonna go sit in the basement.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.025
I got to make sure all the pens work.

02:06.094 --> 02:08.394
All right, everybody.
Let's settle down, please.

02:08.463 --> 02:09.762
Everybody, bring it in.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.798
Welcome, everyone, to St. Barklay's.

02:12.867 --> 02:15.935
For the visiting students,
I am Vice Principal Murray.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.370
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

02:17.439 --> 02:19.872
Now, we all know what happened
last year at St. Mary's.

02:19.941 --> 02:21.006
So I don't think it would hurt

02:21.075 --> 02:22.942
to do a quick little recap of the rules.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.244
Rule number one... no pranking.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.311
You know who you are.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.813
That's me!

02:28.950 --> 02:30.549
Thank you. Thank you.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.084
Yeah, that's my boy.

02:32.153 --> 02:35.788
Second rule... no half-empty
bottles of kahlúa.

02:35.857 --> 02:37.889
Drew, this is going in
the contraband locker

02:37.958 --> 02:39.658
next to the firecrackers
and the crickets.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.593
But there's not much air in there,

02:41.662 --> 02:44.630
so those crickets are probably dead.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.165
Anyway, on to my next
piece of business...

02:47.234 --> 02:49.000
the bestowing of the golden whistle

02:49.069 --> 02:51.570
to this year's Faith Leader.

02:51.639 --> 02:52.971
This is it.

02:53.039 --> 02:54.839
Now, remember what
Taylor Swift taught you.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.741
Look surprised when they call your name.

02:56.810 --> 02:57.842
A duty is som...

02:57.911 --> 02:59.244
Jimmy O'Neal!

03:01.481 --> 03:02.781
What?!

03:02.849 --> 03:05.784
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.Addic7ed.com -

03:07.921 --> 03:10.254
Um, I think you made a mistake.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.922
My whole life has been
a series of mistakes.

03:11.991 --> 03:14.825
You're gonna have to be
more specific there, champ.

03:14.894 --> 03:17.628
It was my turn to be Faith Leader.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.630
I worked the last
three retreats for this.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.999
Last year, I was the
most trustworthy person

03:22.067 --> 03:23.100
in the trust exercises.

03:23.169 --> 03:25.035
You said that. Your words, Murray.

03:25.104 --> 03:27.337
Kenny, I don't need you as Faith Leader.

03:27.406 --> 03:28.772
You're always well-behaved.

03:28.841 --> 03:31.275
But your brother terrifies me.

03:31.343 --> 03:33.010
One good way to keep a troublemaker down

03:33.078 --> 03:35.045
is to make him believe he can be more,

03:35.114 --> 03:36.213
even if it's a lie.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.580
That's how I got roped into this job.

03:37.649 --> 03:40.017
So, you're saying I'm being
punished for being a good guy?

03:40.085 --> 03:41.351
'Cause I'm pretty sure that's profiling.

03:41.420 --> 03:44.220
I do not profile anyone, especially you.

03:44.289 --> 03:45.855
Speaking of which, if
you're not comfortable

03:45.924 --> 03:47.056
sleeping with all those other boys

03:47.125 --> 03:49.726
because of your... Blossoming sexuality,

03:49.795 --> 03:51.227
you can sleep in here.

03:51.296 --> 03:52.729
Not with me, of course.

03:52.798 --> 03:55.365
I will be sleeping
with all the other boys.

03:55.434 --> 03:56.966
N-nope.

03:57.035 --> 03:58.901
The office is yours all by yourself

03:58.970 --> 04:01.210
- for no particular reason.
- I don't want to stay in here.

04:01.239 --> 04:03.405
It smells like Funyuns
and Axe body spray.

04:03.474 --> 04:05.074
You got a keen nose, Kenny.

04:05.143 --> 04:08.744
If you do change your mind,
I got a case of 5-hour energy.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.347
I accidentally bought
the women's version.

04:11.415 --> 04:13.082
Your bones will thank you.

04:13.151 --> 04:15.051
You can keep your room.

04:15.119 --> 04:16.985
Hmm. Okay.

04:17.053 --> 04:19.321
O-okay.

04:19.390 --> 04:20.980
- Yeah, baby!
- Boom! There it is!

04:21.892 --> 04:24.660
Yeah! Whoo! Boom. Let's go.

04:24.729 --> 04:26.562
I didn't know you had company.

04:26.630 --> 04:28.510
Yeah, I invited a friend
over to watch the game.

04:28.566 --> 04:29.931
Sam, Eileen. Eileen, Sam.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.867
Sam's a detective at the station

04:31.935 --> 04:34.002
and a recently divorced lesbian.

04:34.071 --> 04:36.071
Hi. There's at least
three things in there

04:36.139 --> 04:38.379
- he didn't need to tell you.
- No, she would have asked.

04:38.441 --> 04:39.407
Aah!

04:39.476 --> 04:40.675
Come on!

04:40.744 --> 04:42.010
- Well...
- What was that?

04:42.079 --> 04:43.778
I also have a friend

04:43.847 --> 04:46.614
who's, uh, probably gonna be
stopping by any minute now.

04:46.683 --> 04:48.083
So... but you probably
already figured that out,

04:48.151 --> 04:49.784
didn't you, Detective?

04:49.853 --> 04:51.452
Case closed on this one.

04:51.521 --> 04:53.053
Pew, pew.

04:53.122 --> 04:54.054
Aah!

04:54.123 --> 04:55.022
That's it!

04:59.028 --> 05:00.428
What took you so long?

05:00.497 --> 05:01.729
I was mid-manicure,

05:01.798 --> 05:03.918
but I rushed over here as
soon as I knew I was needed.

05:03.933 --> 05:05.099
I parked on your lawn. What's wrong?

05:05.167 --> 05:06.967
Pat's friends with a lesbian detective

05:07.036 --> 05:07.935
and they're in the basement.

05:08.004 --> 05:09.236
That's a lot to process.

05:09.305 --> 05:11.872
It's our first single weekend,

05:11.941 --> 05:13.640
and he's already got a friend.

05:13.709 --> 05:15.910
He's so much better
at divorce than I am.

05:15.978 --> 05:17.978
I bet they're complaining
about their exes.

05:18.047 --> 05:19.413
Maybe you could go down there

05:19.481 --> 05:21.081
and just casually overhear

05:21.150 --> 05:22.115
every single word of their conversation.

05:22.183 --> 05:23.349
I'll tiptoe.

05:23.419 --> 05:25.452
I was always the best at
"Red Light, Green Light."

05:28.824 --> 05:30.524
Green light.

05:32.193 --> 05:34.060
Thank you all for meeting.

05:34.129 --> 05:36.095
As you know, I'm seeking
the perfect candidate

05:36.164 --> 05:37.631
to be my first kiss.

05:37.699 --> 05:39.799
I want this interview
process to be relaxing,

05:39.867 --> 05:41.634
so I'll just need your
social security number

05:41.702 --> 05:42.668
to check your credit score.

05:42.737 --> 05:44.103
And we're recording.

05:44.172 --> 05:46.105
Uh...

05:46.174 --> 05:48.741
Nice whistle, Faith Leader Jimmy.

05:48.810 --> 05:50.509
Ah, so much for beating
your record this year, huh?

05:50.578 --> 05:52.145
C-can you think of anything else

05:52.213 --> 05:55.080
that saran wrap can be
used for other than pranks?

05:55.149 --> 05:56.949
Because I can't. I
can't think of one thing.

05:57.017 --> 05:59.017
All right. Well, later.

05:59.086 --> 06:00.553
All right. We need to talk.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.573
I have a really, really good feeling

06:02.598 --> 06:04.180
that if you tell V.P. Murray

06:04.224 --> 06:06.425
you don't want to be faith
leader, he'll give it to me.

06:06.494 --> 06:07.694
I mean, you don't... you

06:07.719 --> 06:08.885
don't want the job anyway, right?

06:08.930 --> 06:11.029
No. I don't even know why
Murray picked me for it.

06:11.098 --> 06:12.297
Oh, I do.

06:12.366 --> 06:14.099
He said that a good way
to keep a troublemaker down

06:14.168 --> 06:15.700
is to make him believe he can do more.

06:15.769 --> 06:18.170
He believes that I can do more?
He said... he said that to you?

06:18.238 --> 06:19.438
No. You are missing the point.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.006
Stop trying to be something you're not.

06:21.075 --> 06:22.841
Just let me have the job.

06:22.909 --> 06:24.429
You don't think I can do this, do you?

06:25.612 --> 06:28.045
I'm gonna prove to you
and to everybody else

06:28.114 --> 06:30.147
that I deserve the Faith Leader title.

06:30.216 --> 06:32.517
So, why don't you go lay
down in your sleeping bag

06:32.586 --> 06:34.018
and wait till I tell
you what to do next?

06:35.154 --> 06:37.121
You think I'll take orders from you?

06:37.190 --> 06:39.223
Oh.

06:39.292 --> 06:40.525
- Oh, what's this?
- Don't you blow that.

06:40.594 --> 06:41.659
Don't you dare blow my whistle.

06:41.728 --> 06:43.528
Let me tell you.

06:43.597 --> 06:47.131
It is a very hard job keeping
the troublemakers in line.

06:48.801 --> 06:50.667
And I'm gonna prove it to you...

06:50.736 --> 06:52.970
By being a troublemaker.

06:53.039 --> 06:56.040
Troublemakers don't call
themselves troublemakers.

06:56.109 --> 07:00.211
Well, I'm gonna bring it
like it has never been brung.

07:00.279 --> 07:02.045
Brought. Is it brought?

07:02.114 --> 07:04.147
Either way, that's what's happening.

07:05.618 --> 07:07.350
Jodi, what are you doing?

07:07.419 --> 07:09.419
Me? Nothing.

07:09.488 --> 07:12.322
Just doing a little laundry.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.257
How did you know I'm here?

07:14.326 --> 07:16.894
Well, uh, can't speak for Pat here,

07:16.962 --> 07:19.095
but a pretty lady
always gets my attention.

07:19.164 --> 07:20.497
Hi. I'm Sam.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.831
I'm Jodi.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.034
And I'm totally bi when
it comes to compliments.

07:24.102 --> 07:25.468
Scooch over, Pat.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.739
Will you just tell Eileen
that she can come down here?

07:29.807 --> 07:31.541
It's better than having
her listen through the door.

07:31.609 --> 07:34.176
I'm not listening through the door.

07:34.245 --> 07:37.112
The door was open and sound travels up.

07:37.181 --> 07:39.015
That's science.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.182
Charcuterie, anyone?

07:40.251 --> 07:42.852
Oh, none for me. I just became a vegan.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.219
Vegan?

07:44.288 --> 07:46.689
When did you decide not to like food?

07:46.758 --> 07:49.224
Oh, well, truthfully, after my divorce.

07:49.293 --> 07:51.593
I, uh, figured I should
try some new things...

07:51.662 --> 07:55.197
changed my diet, uh, taking
voice lessons, making candles.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.932
I'm sorry. Did you say making candles?

07:57.000 --> 07:57.966
Yeah.

07:58.035 --> 07:59.401
Paraffin wax or soy wax?

07:59.470 --> 08:00.635
Soy.

08:00.704 --> 08:02.037
Cored wicks or flat?

08:02.106 --> 08:03.572
Well, I let the candle tell me.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.075
That's what I say.

08:06.143 --> 08:08.109
- Huh.
- Huh.

08:08.178 --> 08:11.145
There's the crew Jimmy
normally hangs with.

08:11.214 --> 08:12.981
I'm gonna make my move.

08:13.050 --> 08:16.451
I just need a cool first
line to show them I'm bad.

08:16.519 --> 08:18.252
Hi, drew. I like your shirt.

08:20.123 --> 08:21.089
Who are you?

08:21.157 --> 08:22.256
I'm Jimmy's brother.

08:22.325 --> 08:23.491
Jimmy the traitor?

08:23.560 --> 08:24.658
That's right.

08:24.727 --> 08:26.327
So, I thought of a prank we could pull.

08:26.396 --> 08:28.229
When Jimmy asks us a question,

08:28.298 --> 08:31.065
we mouth the words
but don't say anything

08:31.134 --> 08:33.134
to make him think he
has a hearing problem.

08:33.203 --> 08:34.202
Like this.

08:36.371 --> 08:37.505
What?

08:37.573 --> 08:38.839
Exactly.

08:38.908 --> 08:40.340
That's stupid.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.409
One, two, three, eyes on me.

08:42.477 --> 08:44.912
All right. I'm your Faith Leader, Jimmy.

08:44.981 --> 08:46.647
If you just stick to
your Jesus journaling

08:46.716 --> 08:49.783
and your gratitude lists,
there shouldn't be any problem.

08:49.852 --> 08:51.085
Faith Leader.

08:51.153 --> 08:52.252
Out.

08:52.321 --> 08:55.255
What can we do to get
away from this guy?

08:57.859 --> 09:00.327
I've changed my mind.
I'm gonna need this room.

09:00.395 --> 09:01.607
There's a boy from holy crown

09:01.608 --> 09:03.330
that's been eyeing me in a way
that makes me uncomfortable.

09:03.398 --> 09:04.598
Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna have to

09:04.600 --> 09:08.301
nip this one in the butt... in the bud.

09:08.370 --> 09:09.836
- Office is yours.
- Great.

09:09.904 --> 09:11.304
I'm also going to need my own key

09:11.373 --> 09:12.639
and access to your mini fridge.

09:12.707 --> 09:15.041
You got it. Can you just do me a favor?

09:15.110 --> 09:16.175
Don't touch my lunchables.

09:16.244 --> 09:17.777
Let me make this very clear.

09:17.846 --> 09:19.679
I will eat all the lunchables I want.

09:19.748 --> 09:21.280
Well, I've established my boundaries,

09:21.349 --> 09:23.850
but it's clear you've
also established yours.

09:23.918 --> 09:25.317
You know what you just reminded me of?

09:25.386 --> 09:27.654
My ex-wife. Getting chills.

09:27.722 --> 09:31.490
Who knew being so bad
would feel so good?

09:31.559 --> 09:34.960
And now to celebrate my victory.

09:35.029 --> 09:38.297
Mm. God, that is chalky.

09:38.366 --> 09:39.498
Why didn't I shake well?

09:40.179 --> 09:42.222
- Here it is.
- Wait.

09:42.223 --> 09:44.216
So, we have this place
to ourselves all weekend?

09:44.285 --> 09:45.685
Yeah.

09:45.753 --> 09:49.455
And a private bathroom for
those of us with a shy colon.

09:49.524 --> 09:51.223
Yo, you know what this place needs?

09:51.292 --> 09:53.125
- My kahlúa.
- I don't know how we're gonna do that.

09:53.194 --> 09:55.060
- V.P. Murray took it.
- Oh, man, I don't know.

09:55.129 --> 09:56.449
But if you could figure out a way

09:56.497 --> 09:58.564
to throw a party in the
vice principal's office

09:58.633 --> 10:01.766
during a retreat, you'd be a legend.

10:01.836 --> 10:03.902
Four, five, six, explain this.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.611
Who wants to tell me
why we're all in here

10:05.639 --> 10:07.136
and not working on our "Catholics

10:07.161 --> 10:08.965
against human trafficking Puppet Show"?

10:09.009 --> 10:11.076
Because...

10:11.145 --> 10:14.679
Using felt and buttons is an inane way

10:14.748 --> 10:18.950
to address the growing epidemic
of domestic sex slavery.

10:19.018 --> 10:20.485
Yeah, in your face, Jimmy.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.119
Human rights!

10:22.188 --> 10:23.455
Puppet Show.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.589
Now.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.596
What is all of this?

10:32.665 --> 10:35.799
Oh, I invited Sam over
to work on our candles.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.502
She's having some challenging
issues with air bubbles.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.271
It's a rookie error. She needs me.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.974
Okay. I'm just gonna come out
and say this like an adult.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.609
Sam is my friend. I had
her first. She's mine.

10:45.678 --> 10:48.645
Pat, there's a whole world
of people we're gonna meet.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.781
We can't just go through
all of them, calling dibs.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.383
Which reminds me, I
haven't officially called...

10:52.451 --> 10:53.784
Dibs!

10:55.053 --> 10:56.019
Okay.

10:56.088 --> 10:57.187
I'm happy you're friends with Sam.

10:57.256 --> 10:58.255
And I don't need to be part of

10:58.323 --> 10:59.923
your stupid little candle party, either.

10:59.925 --> 11:01.157
Yeah, I called it stupid.

11:01.226 --> 11:02.493
Because I think it's
stupid to make something

11:02.561 --> 11:04.695
so readily available at a store.

11:06.731 --> 11:09.465
Jodi, it's me. It's Pat.

11:09.534 --> 11:11.134
It's the number to my landline.

11:11.203 --> 11:13.370
Because I'm trying to establish
my own space and independence.

11:13.438 --> 11:14.504
Look, I need you to come over.

11:14.572 --> 11:15.872
Pat, I'd love to,

11:15.941 --> 11:17.974
but I really got to get this
nail situation under control.

11:18.043 --> 11:19.742
I wasn't finished.

11:19.811 --> 11:22.144
Bring your karaoke machine.

11:22.213 --> 11:23.312
Finally.

11:23.381 --> 11:24.580
I'll be right there!

11:24.649 --> 11:25.815
Ahh! Okay.

11:30.054 --> 11:31.153
So, turns out

11:31.222 --> 11:33.756
there's zero viable tail
in the freshman group.

11:33.825 --> 11:34.990
Any options for me in your crew?

11:35.059 --> 11:36.258
So, "crew's" caught on?

11:36.327 --> 11:37.693
Is anyone calling it the "K-crew" yet?

11:37.762 --> 11:39.228
- No.
- Okay, well,

11:39.297 --> 11:40.329
They will.

11:40.398 --> 11:41.730
'Cause you know what, Shannon?

11:41.799 --> 11:43.933
I am throwing an epic party tonight.

11:44.001 --> 11:45.100
Really? You?

11:45.169 --> 11:46.302
Yes.

11:46.370 --> 11:48.203
Just need to get the
confiscated kahlúa.

11:48.272 --> 11:49.671
Okay. If you let me come,

11:49.740 --> 11:52.007
I'll tell you the combination to
V.P. Murray's contraband locker.

11:52.076 --> 11:53.108
Deal.

11:53.177 --> 11:54.576
0-2-25.

11:54.645 --> 11:57.045
It's his ex-wife's birthday.
He uses it for everything.

11:57.113 --> 11:59.380
The fact that you know that scares me.

11:59.450 --> 12:01.783
This is why I have trouble meeting men.

12:04.087 --> 12:06.421
So, once you pour in the wax,

12:06.490 --> 12:09.958
then you tap the sides
of the mold like this.

12:10.026 --> 12:11.525
Tap, tap.

12:11.594 --> 12:13.394
And that's how you get
rid of all the bubbles.

12:13.396 --> 12:15.763

or outside or maybe put it in an alley?

12:27.944 --> 12:29.343
Hey, Sam.

12:29.411 --> 12:30.811
Gosh, didn't you say you were
taking some voice lessons?

12:30.880 --> 12:31.879
Why don't you show us what you got?

12:31.948 --> 12:33.614
Gosh, I'd love to.

12:33.683 --> 12:35.883
We're already priming the wicks.

12:35.952 --> 12:37.751

Listen, uh, ohh, I have, uh,

13:41.081 --> 13:44.616
been in situations like this
with married couples before.

13:44.685 --> 13:47.285
Usually there isn't this much foreplay.

13:47.354 --> 13:49.888
But, uh, whatever's going on here,

13:49.957 --> 13:52.357
you guys really need to hash it out.

13:52.426 --> 13:53.858
Um...

13:53.927 --> 13:55.093
It's probably for the best.

13:55.162 --> 13:57.195
It was about more than
the candles for me.

13:57.264 --> 13:58.729
Oh.

13:58.798 --> 14:00.798
Wait. Come back!

14:00.867 --> 14:02.233
We can work this out.

14:02.302 --> 14:03.701
Great.

14:03.770 --> 14:05.136
Because you had to
act like a little baby,

14:05.205 --> 14:06.671
I just lost my new best friend.

14:06.739 --> 14:07.972
Your best friend?

14:08.041 --> 14:09.306
Huh.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.976
Did you sign up for classes
at potpourri pals together?

14:12.045 --> 14:14.045
- What?
- This is bull crap!

14:14.113 --> 14:15.813
Why don't you start paying attention

14:15.882 --> 14:18.215
to the one person that
drops everything for you?

14:18.284 --> 14:20.818
Not just today... always.

14:20.887 --> 14:22.653
I've been here through your divorce

14:22.722 --> 14:25.556
and Kenny coming out and Jimmy.

14:25.624 --> 14:27.491
Taking me for granted is one thing,

14:27.560 --> 14:29.893
but karaoke fighting over another woman

14:29.962 --> 14:31.661
right in front of me?

14:31.730 --> 14:33.497
It crosses a line.

14:36.435 --> 14:38.202
Turn around, bright eyes?

14:38.270 --> 14:39.369
I think I will.

14:45.443 --> 14:47.443
Did not see that coming.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.112
I have the combination,

14:49.180 --> 14:53.016
but how am I gonna figure out
which is the contraband locker?

14:55.000 --> 15:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:02.527 --> 15:05.027
I feel like what I'm doing
is cool and dangerous,

15:05.096 --> 15:06.862
but I am so disappointed

15:06.931 --> 15:09.532
by the choices these
students are making.

15:09.601 --> 15:14.069
Yeah. Best party ever.

15:17.975 --> 15:20.415
What do you mean if you could
live in any era, you'd pick now?

15:20.444 --> 15:22.878
Paris in the '20s was
obviously the right answer.

15:22.947 --> 15:26.115
Hey, I'd like to propose a
toast to our leader, Kenny.

15:26.183 --> 15:28.583
To Kenny!

15:29.753 --> 15:31.433
All right. Hand goes
up, mouth goes closed.

15:31.455 --> 15:32.521
What? No.

15:32.589 --> 15:36.658
Um, hands... hands down, mouths open!

15:36.726 --> 15:38.627
Yeah! What are you doing?

15:38.695 --> 15:39.935
- Shut it down.
- Are you kidding?

15:39.963 --> 15:42.230
This is the greatest party
that has ever been thrown

15:42.299 --> 15:44.666
at a Central Illinois Catholic
youth retreat, and I did it.

15:44.734 --> 15:46.500
Come on, Kenny! This is not you.

15:46.569 --> 15:48.235
You don't throw
parties. You're not cool.

15:48.304 --> 15:49.503
You swallowed your mouthwash

15:49.572 --> 15:51.139
and had to lie down
because you felt woozy.

15:51.207 --> 15:53.641
Yeah, well, shutting
down parties isn't you.

15:53.710 --> 15:55.150
Come on. Walk away. Let this happen.

15:55.211 --> 15:56.610
No can do, son.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.913
I've been given a great
responsibility as Faith Leader,

15:58.982 --> 16:00.081
and I have to fulfill it.

16:00.150 --> 16:00.982
Don't...

16:02.851 --> 16:04.491
All right. Party's over.

16:04.554 --> 16:06.587
Hell, no! We won't go!

16:06.656 --> 16:08.322
Hell, no! We won't go!

16:08.391 --> 16:10.023
- Hell, no!
- You did this to yourself.

16:10.092 --> 16:12.092
Ow, ow, I'm getting woozy.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.759
Oh, this sucks! I can't
believe your brother's

16:15.760 --> 16:17.775
making us do these
stupid apology letters.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.810
Ah, Jimmy ruined everything.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.846
I wish we could think
of a way to get him back.

16:21.915 --> 16:22.981
Yeah.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.282
Oh, we could put gum in his whistle.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.717
Yeah. That'll take the
wind out of his sails.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.952
Or we could totally humiliate him

16:29.021 --> 16:30.688
by saran-wrapping him in his underwear

16:30.757 --> 16:32.390
in the middle of the auditorium.

16:32.458 --> 16:34.024
I mean, that is a total Jimmy move.

16:34.093 --> 16:35.826
Okay. Let's meet up
outside the auditorium.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.828
Everyone's next door watching
"The Ten Commandments,"

16:37.897 --> 16:40.731
so that only leaves us 3 hours
and 40 minutes to pull this off.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.866
Let's do this!

16:41.934 --> 16:43.467
All right!

16:43.536 --> 16:45.202
This is it.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.703
I'm having my legendary night

16:46.772 --> 16:48.638
and I'm gonna shut down Jimmy for good.

16:48.707 --> 16:50.607
It's all coming together.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.510
What the...

16:53.578 --> 16:54.644
Hello, Kenny.

16:54.713 --> 16:56.579
Oh, great. Why are you here?

16:56.648 --> 16:58.215
Well, it is my weekend, buddy.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.482
We meet again.

16:59.551 --> 17:00.750
Jesus.

17:00.819 --> 17:02.519
Hey, Maleficent.

17:02.587 --> 17:04.521
She's still your dark side?

17:04.589 --> 17:06.088
I thought you'd outgrow her.

17:06.156 --> 17:08.724
Turns out you never
outgrow an evil queen.

17:08.794 --> 17:11.359
What you're thinking
about doing now is a doozy.

17:11.430 --> 17:12.694
Are you going to take advice

17:12.763 --> 17:14.597
from a man who uses the word "doozy"?

17:14.665 --> 17:18.434
Right. Jimmy did steal my glory, Jesus.

17:18.502 --> 17:20.102
This was supposed to be my weekend,

17:20.171 --> 17:21.237
and he took it from me.

17:21.306 --> 17:22.738
Of course he did.

17:22.807 --> 17:24.740
And you're bitter and seek revenge.

17:24.809 --> 17:26.375
And those are natural urges.

17:26.444 --> 17:27.876
If you bottle them
up, you'll get cancer.

17:27.945 --> 17:30.446
And she's obviously insane.

17:30.514 --> 17:31.948
Look, I-I know you're disappointed

17:32.016 --> 17:33.282
about not getting Faith Leader,

17:33.351 --> 17:35.383
but just because you didn't
get the thing that you want

17:35.453 --> 17:37.920
doesn't mean you have
to be someone you're not.

17:37.988 --> 17:40.856
Think about your brother.

17:40.925 --> 17:42.357
Think about cancer.

17:47.865 --> 17:48.864
There she is.

17:48.933 --> 17:50.766
Oh.

17:50.835 --> 17:52.434
We know you're mad at us,

17:52.502 --> 17:53.868
and you have every reason to be.

17:53.937 --> 17:56.204
We got a little carried away with Sam.

17:56.273 --> 17:58.573
The truth is, I saw
Pat with a new friend,

17:58.641 --> 18:00.942
and I just... I didn't
know how to deal with it.

18:01.011 --> 18:02.217
Well, but, you know, making new

18:02.242 --> 18:03.602
friends is part of us moving on.

18:03.646 --> 18:05.280
Yeah, but you're moving on first.

18:05.349 --> 18:06.481
But it's not a competition.

18:06.549 --> 18:08.415
Oh, of course it is, Pat.

18:08.485 --> 18:10.585
We've only ever had couple's friends.

18:10.653 --> 18:12.620
And I'm starting to think that
they were mainly friends with us

18:12.689 --> 18:13.988
- because of you.
- What?

18:14.056 --> 18:15.923
It's very hard for me
to make new friends.

18:15.992 --> 18:18.273
But you just did make a new
friend, and she was a lesbian.

18:18.327 --> 18:19.994
That's true. That was really big for me.

18:20.062 --> 18:21.295
I mean, that's a good sign of growth.

18:21.364 --> 18:23.965
Are you kidding me?!
You're doing it again.

18:24.033 --> 18:25.799
Sam's not even here, and
this is all about her.

18:25.868 --> 18:27.968
Jodi, I agree with you.

18:28.037 --> 18:30.804
We haven't been treating
you like a friend.

18:30.873 --> 18:32.272
Because you're family.

18:32.341 --> 18:33.974
And taking loved ones for granted

18:34.043 --> 18:35.742
is what family does best.

18:37.046 --> 18:38.512
Keep going.

18:38.580 --> 18:41.280
We promise we'll do better.

18:41.349 --> 18:43.249
Do you promise to
sing classic '80s duets

18:43.318 --> 18:44.851
with me and only me?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.419
- Promise.
- Promise.

18:46.488 --> 18:48.488
Even meat loaf's "I
would do anything for love

18:48.557 --> 18:49.489
but I won't do that"?

18:49.558 --> 18:50.857
Sure.

18:50.926 --> 18:51.992
I won't do that.

18:52.060 --> 18:53.727
I'll draw up the paperwork.

18:55.030 --> 18:56.362
I tried it on,

18:56.431 --> 18:59.132
but being a badass
doesn't fit me after all.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.666
Jimmy, where are you going?

19:00.735 --> 19:02.502
Drew and his crew are messing
around outside the auditorium.

19:02.570 --> 19:03.936
Mm, no, you can't go there.

19:04.005 --> 19:06.839
Well, I'm the faith leader.
I can do whatever I want.

19:06.908 --> 19:08.041
It's a trap!

19:08.109 --> 19:09.808
They're gonna saran-wrap
your balls to your face.

19:09.877 --> 19:11.444
Okay, that's not physically possible.

19:11.513 --> 19:13.212
And why... why should I even trust you?

19:13.281 --> 19:15.014
Because I'm not...

19:15.082 --> 19:16.882
The type of person who
pranks his own brother.

19:16.918 --> 19:19.284
Look, I'm sorry that I
made your job really hard.

19:19.353 --> 19:21.787
I was just jealous
that you got it over me.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.523
Well, look, I'm jealous of you.

19:24.592 --> 19:26.192
When I was writing you up for the party,

19:26.260 --> 19:28.994
the only thing that I
wrote was "sweet party."

19:29.063 --> 19:30.895
Well, you would have
thrown a better one.

19:30.964 --> 19:32.797
Thank you.

19:32.866 --> 19:35.300
But you are right.
You... you deserve it.

19:35.369 --> 19:38.070
I really wish that you
could be Faith Leader.

19:38.138 --> 19:39.204
I wish you could go back to

19:39.273 --> 19:41.639
being the leader of the crew.

19:41.708 --> 19:43.942
Jimmy, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

19:45.379 --> 19:46.878
Unlikely.

19:46.947 --> 19:48.412
Okay.

19:48.481 --> 19:50.481
Uh, well, here's the plan.

19:50.550 --> 19:51.883
Let me out!

19:51.952 --> 19:52.984
Let me out!

19:53.053 --> 19:55.053
No way! You're getting pranked!

19:55.121 --> 19:55.987
Man.

19:56.056 --> 19:57.088
Holy crap!

19:57.156 --> 19:58.355
Was this your plan the whole time?

19:58.424 --> 20:00.892
A-a double cross? That's genius.

20:00.961 --> 20:02.393
Yeah. Let's get out of here.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.861
We can steal people's phones
and take pictures of our junk!

20:04.930 --> 20:06.863
Yeah!

20:09.302 --> 20:10.367
I missed us.

20:10.436 --> 20:12.103
Me too.

20:12.171 --> 20:14.105
Oh, yeah, no.

20:14.173 --> 20:16.039
Jimmy, I think you made
it a little too tight.

20:16.109 --> 20:17.241
Jimmy!

20:17.310 --> 20:19.276
Yeah, I can't really take a deep breath!

20:19.345 --> 20:20.343
Kenny?

20:20.412 --> 20:22.946
Oh. V.P. Murray. Please help.

20:23.015 --> 20:24.214
You ate them all.

20:24.282 --> 20:26.850
Every single lunchable.

20:36.028 --> 20:37.904
I deserve this.

20:38.428 --> 20:41.128
Why did I think this was a good idea?

20:41.197 --> 20:42.830
Oh, Shannon. Thank god.

20:42.899 --> 20:45.166
- Please help me out of here.
- I don't have time.

20:45.234 --> 20:47.201
I've lowered my expectations,
and it's about to happen.

20:47.269 --> 20:48.268
What?

20:48.337 --> 20:49.436
Don't worry.

20:49.505 --> 20:50.470
I love her.

20:50.539 --> 20:52.539
No, no. Shannon, not with that guy!

20:52.608 --> 20:53.674
Come on! Not where I can hear you!

20:53.742 --> 20:55.041
At least close the door!

20:55.110 --> 20:58.211
That's disgusting.

20:58.279 --> 20:59.779
I did it!

20:59.848 --> 21:01.681
Already?

21:01.750 --> 21:04.250
That was wild.

21:06.855 --> 21:08.521
Well...

21:08.590 --> 21:11.124
Good for you!

21:14.395 --> 21:16.795
Nope. Still stuck. Shannon!

21:16.864 --> 21:19.131
I'm really stuck, and I'm
having a hard time breathing!
