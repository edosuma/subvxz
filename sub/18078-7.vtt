WEBVTT

00:01.625 --> 00:04.025
All right.
He gonna put him down, now.
l can feel it.

00:04.295 --> 00:05.819
[crowd cheering]

00:08.999 --> 00:10.330
B.A.
Hey, man!

00:11.168 --> 00:13.636
He didn't save my life.
l saved his life.

00:13.704 --> 00:16.070
ls there such a thing
as a five-man tag team?

00:16.140 --> 00:17.573
Bring 'em on, Daddy.

00:17.641 --> 00:18.835
[shouting]

00:20.244 --> 00:21.575
No, you took the shell.

00:22.379 --> 00:23.812
Hulkamania is gonna run wild.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.744
No way out
this time, Smith.

00:28.252 --> 00:29.583
(Face)
Now we're cooking.

00:29.653 --> 00:30.984
Oh, l love it.

00:33.691 --> 00:36.057
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:36.127 --> 00:38.027
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:38.095 --> 00:39.426
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.691
These men promptly escaped...

00:40.765 --> 00:42.460
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:42.533 --> 00:44.228
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:44.301 --> 00:45.768
Today, still wanted
by the government...

00:45.836 --> 00:47.804
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

00:47.872 --> 00:50.466
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:50.541 --> 00:51.633
and if you can find them...

00:51.709 --> 00:53.939
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

00:54.011 --> 00:55.603
[gun firing]

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

02:11.488 --> 02:13.115
[crickets chirping]

02:50.227 --> 02:53.128
(ring announcer)
And Big John Studd slams
Hulk Hogan on the mat.

02:53.197 --> 02:54.858
This is
the championship battle...

02:54.932 --> 02:57.264
for the heavyweight title
of the world.

02:57.334 --> 03:00.167
Hulk Hogan.
I've never seen him
in quite so much trouble.

03:00.271 --> 03:02.364
Fans, he can lose
the title here tonight.

03:02.439 --> 03:06.671
Big John Studd couldn't have
had him in a more
compromising position.

03:08.212 --> 03:11.704
Quiet! The Hulkster is up.
He's up and he's mad.

03:11.782 --> 03:13.750
Oh, is he mad.
Go! Let's go!

03:13.817 --> 03:17.048
But Big John Studd
delivers a blow to the back.
And another blow.

03:17.955 --> 03:19.923
Can Hulk Hogan hold on?

03:20.324 --> 03:21.655
And he tosses him
out of the ring.

03:21.725 --> 03:23.852
The Hulkster is being
helped up by a friend.

03:23.928 --> 03:25.987
Come on, Hulk.
Get back in there
and put him away, man!

03:26.063 --> 03:28.657
...but he's in the Hulkster's
special seats.

03:32.036 --> 03:34.163
Hulk Hogan back in the ring.
You're the world champion.

03:34.238 --> 03:35.227
Come on, let's do it.

03:35.306 --> 03:37.297
...is holding the belt
above his head.

03:37.374 --> 03:38.398
Come on!

03:38.475 --> 03:40.841
He must be
a very special friend
of the Hulkster's.

03:41.812 --> 03:44.178
I've never seen
quite so much action.

03:44.248 --> 03:46.910
And Hogan slams Studd
into the turnbuckle.

03:46.984 --> 03:48.975
Oh, the Hulkster is mad.

03:49.520 --> 03:53.183
What a fight!
I have never seen
anything quite like it.

03:53.524 --> 03:56.357
A right to the head.
And another right.

03:57.027 --> 03:58.619
And another yet.

03:58.829 --> 04:00.490
A toss into the ropes
and, oh...

04:00.564 --> 04:02.964
Big John Studd
seems to be weary.

04:03.534 --> 04:06.560
And a kick to the head,
and Studd is down on the mat.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.673
Hulk Hogan pulls him
back into the ring.

04:09.740 --> 04:12.470
But now he's yanked
the Hulktster out of the ring.

04:12.543 --> 04:15.808
And the nefarious Bobby Heenan
is just around the corner.

04:15.879 --> 04:18.211
Let's hope
he doesn't interfere.

04:19.249 --> 04:20.773
There he is. That's Heenan.

04:20.851 --> 04:22.580
He plants a cheap shot
on Hogan.

04:22.653 --> 04:24.382
Hogan tosses him away.

04:24.455 --> 04:26.286
Heenan is being restrained.

04:26.357 --> 04:29.815
Hogan slams Studd
into the concrete
and climbs back into the ring.

04:29.893 --> 04:33.727
Folk's, I've never seen
a match quite like this.
Get out of here!

04:33.897 --> 04:35.797
Referee on top of the action.

04:35.866 --> 04:39.768
And a pickup
on the part of Hulk Hogan,
heavyweight champion.

04:40.504 --> 04:42.335
And it's a left to the head.
Another left.

04:42.406 --> 04:44.169
And yet another. And another.

04:44.241 --> 04:46.141
Hulk is really pouring it on.

04:46.210 --> 04:48.041
He's caught up
in the turnbuckle.

04:48.112 --> 04:50.103
Swings him the length
of the mat and bam!

04:50.180 --> 04:52.671
What kind of a pounding
can this man take?

04:53.017 --> 04:55.110
That is a clothesline.

04:56.086 --> 04:57.678
[crowd chattering]

05:00.257 --> 05:02.157
These two men,
two of the biggest...

05:02.226 --> 05:03.887
in professional
wrestling today...

05:03.961 --> 05:08.057
going at it tooth and nail
for the heavyweight champion
of the world.

05:08.198 --> 05:09.790
No federal agents so far.

05:09.867 --> 05:12.734
But sitting ringside
is asking for it.

05:12.803 --> 05:14.430
Hey, man,
my buddy needs us.

05:14.505 --> 05:16.200
l'll take the next patrol
if you want.

05:17.908 --> 05:19.068
C'mon, man. Go!

05:19.143 --> 05:21.668
And the Hulkster
turns the tables...

05:21.745 --> 05:23.679
on challenger
Big John Studd.

05:23.747 --> 05:25.214
You can just
feel the electricity.

05:25.282 --> 05:26.874
He's gonna put him down, now.
l can feel it.

05:26.950 --> 05:29.817
Hogan has still not
quite been able to
body-slam this man.

05:30.754 --> 05:34.019
Repeated pack of punches
to the head.
The referee breaks it up...

05:34.091 --> 05:36.651
and admonishes
both participants.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.627
Hogan's got Studd
on the ropes.

05:38.695 --> 05:41.220
Studd could be
on his last leg here.

05:42.232 --> 05:44.598
It's a butt to the head.
A head butt.

05:57.181 --> 05:58.546
[thudding]

05:58.682 --> 06:01.173
[shouting]
He is down. The referee's
got the count.

06:01.618 --> 06:05.179
There's 1, 2, 3.
He's out!

06:05.255 --> 06:07.052
Hulk Hogan has won...
He won! He won!

06:07.157 --> 06:08.419
...the heavyweight
championship of the world.

06:08.492 --> 06:09.891
Hogan, the winner.

06:10.160 --> 06:14.961
He has successfully defended
the world's heavyweight title.
Unbelievable!

06:15.032 --> 06:19.025
Now, that unidentified
stranger has climbed in
the ring with Hulk Hogan.

06:19.169 --> 06:21.865
He's gotta be
a very special friend
of the Hulkster.

06:21.939 --> 06:25.568
He's holding the belt.
Victorious once again.

06:26.176 --> 06:30.442
Fabulous action from
the World Wrestling Federation
here in San Diego.

06:34.651 --> 06:36.414
Another successful
title defense...

06:36.487 --> 06:38.011
for the heavyweight champion
of the world.

06:38.088 --> 06:39.817
My guest at this time,
Hulk Hogan...

06:39.890 --> 06:41.790
and what a battle
that one was.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.828
Well, you know,
Mean Gene, ever since
l won the WWF...

06:44.895 --> 06:47.386
World Wrestling Federation
heavyweight title, man...

06:47.464 --> 06:48.829
l've been on
one heck of a roll.

06:48.899 --> 06:52.232
l've been to Tokyo, Japan,
Africa, Asia, Bangkok...

06:52.302 --> 06:53.735
and all points in between.

06:53.837 --> 06:56.533
And you know something?
l've defended this thing
successfully...

06:56.607 --> 06:57.631
everywhere l went.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.266
But l'm really excited,
Mean Gene...

06:59.343 --> 07:01.777
because coming up here,
in a few days, man...

07:01.845 --> 07:04.609
l'm coming to my own hometown,
L.A., brother.

07:04.681 --> 07:06.012
Los Angeles, California.

07:06.083 --> 07:09.109
And more than that,
all the money,
all the Hulkamaniacs...

07:09.186 --> 07:12.553
all the Hulkamania
running wild, all that money
from all my people...

07:12.623 --> 07:15.717
l'm donating that money
to my favorite charity,
Mean Gene.

07:15.792 --> 07:18.852
Okay, now, Hulk Hogan,
you and l have been
very close in the past...

07:18.929 --> 07:20.521
and you've let me in
on some of these things.

07:20.597 --> 07:22.724
May l ask what
that charity will be?

07:22.799 --> 07:24.926
Well, l'd love to let you in
on this one, Mean Gene...

07:25.002 --> 07:26.560
but l want your dollars,
too, man.

07:26.637 --> 07:28.264
l want you right there
at ringside.

07:28.338 --> 07:31.102
This is more important
than top-secret information,
man.

07:31.175 --> 07:32.472
And l want everybody
to know...

07:32.543 --> 07:34.773
come on out, buy a ticket
to see the Hulkster...

07:34.845 --> 07:36.676
because Hulkamania
is gonna run wild.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.578
Your hometown boy
is coming home.

07:38.649 --> 07:40.514
And just a few of my friends
down at the gym...

07:40.584 --> 07:42.245
they know
what the charity's all about.

07:42.319 --> 07:44.810
lt's for a great cause.
l'm 100% behind it.

07:44.888 --> 07:48.324
Because l've been training,
saying my prayers,
eating my vitamins, Daddy.

07:48.392 --> 07:51.759
And wait till you see
how psyched up l am
when l come home to LA.

07:51.828 --> 07:53.819
l love you,
and l'm coming home,
Mean Gene.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.796
[grunting]
There you have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.333
Hulk Hogan,
this coming Saturday night...

07:58.402 --> 08:02.304
Title defense.
The Los Angeles Sports Arena.
Don't you dare miss it.

08:04.474 --> 08:06.305
(B.A.)
Hey, Hulk!
Hey, B.A.!

08:06.376 --> 08:07.673
Hey, man!

08:09.346 --> 08:12.144
Hey, man, good to see you,
man. You're looking great.

08:12.216 --> 08:14.514
Mean, clean,
human destruction machine.
Yeah.

08:14.585 --> 08:16.644
Regular mutual
admiration society.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.449
Hey, man,
l want you to meet Hannibal.

08:18.522 --> 08:19.546
Hi.
How you doing?

08:19.623 --> 08:20.988
Faceman.
How do you do?

08:21.058 --> 08:23.151
Murdock.
Hey, glad to meet you guys.

08:23.227 --> 08:24.353
l'm glad you could make it.

08:24.428 --> 08:27.192
You know,
l had a heck of a time
locating you dudes.

08:27.264 --> 08:30.495
Mr. Hogan, this is truly
an amazing pleasure.

08:30.567 --> 08:33.433
l have been
a wrestling devotee
since l was five years old.

08:33.503 --> 08:35.562
Bruno Sammartino,
Bobo Brazil--

08:35.639 --> 08:37.129
Hey, both fine wrestlers.

08:37.207 --> 08:40.232
l always dreamed of being
a professional wrestler
myself, you know...

08:40.376 --> 08:43.642
but look at me,
look how l turned out.
But you, you are fantastic.

08:43.714 --> 08:45.614
Cool it, Murdock.
Give the man breathing room.

08:45.682 --> 08:47.980
[groaning]
Hey, take it easy, B.A.
l like this dude, man.

08:48.051 --> 08:51.316
Try not to break him, Hulk.
lt's murder finding
new parts.

08:51.388 --> 08:53.948
Come on, let's go.
l gotta change clothes.

08:54.024 --> 08:57.084
Man, it's so good
to see you again.
l love this guy.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.422
You two
met in Vietnam, huh?

08:58.495 --> 09:01.430
Yeah, B.A. was
the baddest dude
l ever met in Nam.

09:01.498 --> 09:03.125
B.A. says he saved
your life over there.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.067
Hey, he didn't save my life,
l saved his life.

09:06.136 --> 09:07.694
No, man,
you getting it all wrong.

09:07.771 --> 09:09.500
You've been getting
this mixed up for years, man.

09:09.573 --> 09:11.700
Don't you remember Da Nang
during the Tet Offensive?

09:11.775 --> 09:13.367
Yeah, and we were
pinned down in the hut...

09:13.443 --> 09:15.434
(both)
and you took the shell
that knocked you cold.

09:15.512 --> 09:16.536
You took the shell.

09:16.613 --> 09:17.705
No, you took the shell.

09:17.781 --> 09:19.305
[both exclaiming]

09:20.784 --> 09:22.513
l think they both
took the shell.

09:23.587 --> 09:25.452
(Hulk)
The blasts puts B.A.
out like a light.

09:25.522 --> 09:27.114
l knew l had to
get him out of there.

09:27.190 --> 09:29.385
Man, l dragged him no more
than 10 feet when, boom!

09:29.459 --> 09:30.926
The hut is blown
straight in the air.

09:30.994 --> 09:32.791
Hey, we were both knocked out
by the blast.

09:32.863 --> 09:36.458
When we came to,
we were side by side
in a hospital in Saigon.

09:36.533 --> 09:37.864
And that's the only part
you got right.

09:37.934 --> 09:40.528
Look, guys,
it was a long time ago and--

09:40.604 --> 09:43.801
Hulk, do you remember
that beautiful nurse
with the short red hair?

09:43.874 --> 09:45.341
No, l don't remember her.

09:45.409 --> 09:46.706
That's because
you was in surgery.

09:46.777 --> 09:48.074
l was the one
that was conscious.

09:48.145 --> 09:49.407
Hey, l was the one
that was conscious.

09:49.479 --> 09:51.470
You were out like a light.
You was the one that was out.

09:51.548 --> 09:53.880
Fellas, l'm sure
the details are fuzzy...

09:53.950 --> 09:55.884
because of the concussion
you both suffered.

09:55.952 --> 09:57.715
Hey, Hannibal,
but l'm clear on this, man.

09:57.788 --> 09:58.948
Hey, so am l, B.A.

09:59.089 --> 10:01.614
Look, what is
the point of arguing...

10:01.692 --> 10:03.626
when you see each other
so rarely?

10:03.694 --> 10:05.059
Yeah, that's true, Hulk.

10:05.128 --> 10:07.494
Look, B.A.,
could you drop me off
at Cindy's?

10:07.564 --> 10:09.896
No way, man.
l helped you out in Mexico,
didn't l?

10:09.966 --> 10:11.228
Now you gonna
help me and Hulk.

10:11.301 --> 10:13.496
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
l don't know who helped whom.

10:13.570 --> 10:15.231
Not that.
l'm talking about his problem.

10:15.305 --> 10:17.364
Yeah, like l was telling you,
l got a problem.

10:17.441 --> 10:20.740
A big problem.
Even bigger than the Hulkster.

10:23.447 --> 10:25.210
[children chattering]

10:30.420 --> 10:32.320
(Sonny)
This is my last offer.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.414
Mr. Carter, l've told you
over and over again...

10:35.492 --> 10:37.153
you're wasting your time.
No sale.

10:37.227 --> 10:38.251
Goodbye.

10:38.328 --> 10:40.592
Look, Miss Gordon,
you miss one more payment
on this place...

10:40.664 --> 10:42.291
and the bank's
gonna own your sweet--

10:42.366 --> 10:43.958
But that's my problem.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.502
Hey, l'm tired of
bringing you gifts
and reasonable offers.

10:46.570 --> 10:48.401
Your old man would have jumped
at a price like this.

10:48.472 --> 10:50.201
My father would never
sell this property...

10:50.273 --> 10:52.173
and what the heck do you know
about my father?

10:52.242 --> 10:54.210
l know that he's six feet
under the ground...

10:54.277 --> 10:56.939
and unless you want
a plot next to him,
you'll take the dough.

10:57.013 --> 11:00.039
Look, l know this is hard
for you to understand...

11:00.117 --> 11:02.915
but without this center,
these kids have nowhere to go.

11:02.986 --> 11:04.715
So, thank you very much
for dropping by.

11:04.788 --> 11:08.019
Now, you gentlemen,
you know your way to the door.

11:08.425 --> 11:09.949
Shut the door.

11:11.194 --> 11:14.129
Now, you listen up, chicky,
and you listen good.

11:14.264 --> 11:16.323
Your little problems
are not over.

11:16.433 --> 11:20.301
That fire in the basement
last week,
the surprise inspections.

11:20.370 --> 11:23.066
Who knows, there might even be
a very bad accident.

11:23.140 --> 11:27.270
And l know you wouldn't
want anything to happen
to one of your kids.

11:27.344 --> 11:32.247
Mister, if anything happens
to anybody around here...

11:32.315 --> 11:34.749
l'm gonna personally
drive my car
down to your boat...

11:34.818 --> 11:37.981
and l'm not gonna stop
until l make sure
you're part of the dock.

11:38.054 --> 11:39.988
Miss G., we lost another ball.

11:40.056 --> 11:42.854
Hold it, right there.
Get outside, Kerry.

11:43.126 --> 11:44.320
Outside!

11:44.394 --> 11:46.862
Just give me a reason,
please.

11:47.597 --> 11:50.327
Hey, this is just a friendly
business proposition.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.662
There's no harm intended.

11:51.735 --> 11:52.895
Yeah, sure.

11:53.136 --> 11:56.037
Now let me tell you this,
once and for all.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.233
No sale and no threats.

11:58.408 --> 12:00.376
lf anything happens
to any kids around here...

12:00.444 --> 12:01.706
l'm gonna hold you
personally--

12:01.778 --> 12:02.767
[gasps]

12:03.213 --> 12:05.647
Nobody pulls a gun on me.
Nobody!

12:05.816 --> 12:08.011
We'll continue this
on the top of Mulholland.

12:08.084 --> 12:10.552
[knocking on door]
Now, come on.
Get rid of that kid.

12:10.620 --> 12:13.384
Hey, kid, why don't you
go play in traffic?

12:13.723 --> 12:15.486
[grunts]
Hulkster.

12:15.559 --> 12:16.548

12:28.038 --> 12:31.405
Are you okay?
Yeah. You got to nail them,
Hulkster.

12:34.711 --> 12:36.508
You all right?
Yeah, l'm fine.

12:42.319 --> 12:44.150
[tires screeching]

12:47.557 --> 12:48.649
Move over, man!

12:52.229 --> 12:53.719
Oh, no!

12:53.930 --> 12:55.295
l'm sure
they'll be all right.

12:55.365 --> 12:57.196
Yeah, but what's worse,
them catching them...

12:57.267 --> 12:58.757
or them not catching them?

13:18.722 --> 13:20.212
Hey, they're heading
up the walk.

13:20.290 --> 13:22.952
Them crazy fools.
There are too many people
up there.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.149
[exclaims]

13:27.597 --> 13:29.394
[people screaming]

13:30.233 --> 13:31.393
Be careful, B.A.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.400
[car honking]

13:41.778 --> 13:43.507
[gun firing]

14:00.130 --> 14:01.119
Hey.

14:08.605 --> 14:09.936
l love it.

14:24.854 --> 14:26.287
[tires screeching]

14:39.936 --> 14:41.767
We'll get them next time.

14:43.373 --> 14:44.397
Darn!

14:53.016 --> 14:56.247
Then we had a small fire,
a couple of break-ins...

14:56.319 --> 14:58.947
and then there was
inspectors running
all around the place...

14:59.022 --> 15:02.048
and now the banks
are threatening
to close in on me.

15:02.158 --> 15:06.424
But after Saturday night,
your mortgage problems
will be history.

15:07.897 --> 15:10.365
lf it wasn't for the Hulkster,
we'd be closed down by now.

15:10.433 --> 15:13.425
l wrote him 'cause l knew
he was from Venice
and involved with charities.

15:13.503 --> 15:16.438
And l'd do anything
for the kids
in this neighborhood.

15:16.539 --> 15:20.202
This center
is their only outlet.
lf we go under--

15:20.276 --> 15:21.436
You ain't going under.

15:21.511 --> 15:23.979
Hey, between the Hulkster
and the A-Team...

15:24.047 --> 15:25.514
you don't have
a thing to worry about.

15:25.582 --> 15:28.142
Face, what do you know
about Sonny Carter?

15:28.218 --> 15:31.187
Well, he's a very high-profile
yacht dealer in the marina.

15:31.254 --> 15:34.690
Doesn't sell any boat
that goes for less
than a million dollars.

15:34.758 --> 15:36.282
What does he want
with this property?

15:36.359 --> 15:38.418
Tear it down.
Maybe he'd put up condos.

15:38.561 --> 15:40.825
There are plenty of lots
around here he could pick up.

15:40.897 --> 15:42.330
He doesn't sound
like a developer.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.163
Hey, l say we go down there,
kick this dudes door in...

15:45.235 --> 15:46.964
and let him know
that we're in town, man.

15:47.037 --> 15:48.436
That ain't the way
we do things here.

15:48.505 --> 15:51.804
We may have to go in
and run a con, drop a bug,
do a little smooth talking.

15:51.875 --> 15:55.470
Okay, B.A. You come with me.
You do the smooth talking.
Let's go, man.

15:55.545 --> 15:57.775
No, we just can't go in there
and kick down the guy's door.

15:57.847 --> 15:58.871
We need a plan.

15:58.948 --> 16:00.074
Well, who makes the plan?

16:00.150 --> 16:01.139
Hannibal.

16:01.651 --> 16:02.879
Hannibal, what's the plan?

16:02.952 --> 16:04.351
You guys ought to
go down there...

16:04.454 --> 16:07.116
kick this guy's door in,
let him know you're in town.

16:07.190 --> 16:09.522
Hannibal,
he's always thinking.
Yeah.

16:09.592 --> 16:10.991
You guys check out
Sonny Carter.

16:11.061 --> 16:12.688
l'll go to City Hall
and find out...

16:12.762 --> 16:15.230
if there's any reason
he really
wants this developed.

16:16.933 --> 16:19.163
Hey, l like it.
We're rolling.

16:20.537 --> 16:21.526
All right.

16:22.772 --> 16:24.171
[birds cawing]

16:34.317 --> 16:36.046
(Carter)
Just let me handle it, Papa.

16:36.119 --> 16:39.748
l heard about the way
you handled it this morning,
Mr. Carter.

16:39.823 --> 16:42.485
l don't understand
why a crummy building
in Venice...

16:42.559 --> 16:44.117
is beyond your reach.

16:44.194 --> 16:46.992
We're gonna
get the building, Papa.
l know what l'm doing.

16:47.063 --> 16:48.860
lf it were up to me,
we'd go down there...

16:48.932 --> 16:50.763
with a couple of
Thompson machine guns--

16:50.834 --> 16:52.859
And what? And my name
is all over the dock.

16:52.936 --> 16:55.666
l go down there
and start a war,
guess where they come looking?

16:55.739 --> 16:58.264
Al Capone never had
his name on a sign.

16:58.341 --> 17:02.675
Fast cars, fancy women,
your picture in the paper
all the time.

17:02.746 --> 17:04.577
This is no way
to run a family.

17:04.646 --> 17:07.945
This is Hollywood, Papa.
Hey, come on,
give me a little credit.

17:08.017 --> 17:10.577
l got 40 guys
doing 500 G's a year plus.

17:10.653 --> 17:12.951
And on top of that,
we're almost 80% legit now.

17:13.021 --> 17:16.651
Yeah, Carter is legitimate.
Kotero, ew....

17:16.726 --> 17:18.955
Hey, when you went
into the pen...

17:19.028 --> 17:20.586
you left a lot of heat
on the street.

17:20.663 --> 17:22.631
l didn't change my name.
Mama did.

17:22.699 --> 17:25.634
You should've taken care
of this with Louie Gordon
before he died.

17:25.702 --> 17:27.431
Things are different
out here now, Papa.

17:27.503 --> 17:28.835
Twenty years is a long time.

17:28.905 --> 17:31.169
lt's not like it was
when you and Uncle Louie
hit town.

17:31.241 --> 17:33.038
We need
that property, Sonny...

17:33.109 --> 17:35.236
no matter what it takes
to get it.

17:35.311 --> 17:37.142
You wanna go back
and sit in a jail cell?

17:37.213 --> 17:40.512
She can't make the payment,
l pick it up from my man
at the bank. That's it.

17:40.583 --> 17:41.811
What if she makes the payment?

17:41.885 --> 17:44.046
Hulk Hogan is going
to bail the place out.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.951
Then we take care of him, too.

17:46.790 --> 17:49.384
lt may not be that simple,
Sonny.

17:51.060 --> 17:53.255
Look, Papa, l gotta go.
l got guests.

17:53.329 --> 17:54.626
Yeah, go.

17:55.799 --> 17:58.290
l'll go downstairs
to sit in my room.

18:03.673 --> 18:06.198
l want what is mine, Sonny.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.206
Capisce?
Capisce.

18:15.385 --> 18:18.218
Murdock was telling me
that you're still
afraid of flying.

18:18.288 --> 18:20.483
You, the dude
that saved my life?

18:20.557 --> 18:21.854
Don't start with me.

18:21.925 --> 18:23.825
Hey, B.A.,
l didn't mean it that way.

18:23.927 --> 18:26.361
l just didn't think that you
were afraid of anything.

18:26.462 --> 18:28.623
Hey, man, ain't you afraid
of something?
Nothing.

18:28.698 --> 18:30.325
Come on, man.
Everybody's afraid
of something.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.628
Hey, not me.

18:31.701 --> 18:34.033
Oh, man. How about
a pit full of snakes?

on the list.

19:21.618 --> 19:22.676
You gonna bid on the boat?

19:22.752 --> 19:24.242
Yeah, we're here
to bid on the boat.

You think it's big enough,
brother?

lt's such a pleasure
meeting you, Mr. Hogan.

19:29.392 --> 19:31.587
Well, go on in.
l'm sure Mr. Carter...

19:31.661 --> 19:33.561
is going to be thrilled
to see you.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.858
Thrilled is not the word.

19:34.931 --> 19:36.922
Oh, my goodness.
Look at that, Craig.
Look who's there.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.558
Let's get an opening shot

19:54.751 --> 19:57.151
l'd like to welcome you all
to the Lady Princess.

19:57.220 --> 19:58.949
As you know,
l recently obtained her...

that the lower decks
hold many secrets.

She sleeps 1 2,
including crew quarters.

Hey, we'll take it.
How much?

20:11.935 --> 20:13.095
What are you doing here?

20:13.169 --> 20:14.796
We wouldn't miss this
for the world.

of buying.

Hey, Lenny,
how are you doing, man?

20:18.875 --> 20:21.435
Thanks a lot for your donation
for the Boys Center.

Thanks for
the ringside seats.

Hey, you guys ought to hit up
some of this crowd.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.676
That's a good idea.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.945
Hey, you're going to
make a donation,
right, Sonny?

20:30.420 --> 20:32.445
Yeah, sure.
l'll be one of the first.

to write a check right now.

You know, l'm tired of being

Why don't you guys
let me broaden
my acting repertoire?

You gave them a check
for $25,000?

That's the way you handle it?
You give them money?

We're supposed to be getting
my money back.

21:26.042 --> 21:27.066

Murdock,
l think l got something.

[men grunting]

24:30.126 --> 24:31.115
Well....

24:31.928 --> 24:34.726
You can tell Mr. Carter
that the Center
is here to stay.

24:34.797 --> 24:37.129
And thank him
for the donation.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.595
[B.A. laughing]

24:44.674 --> 24:47.302
Sonny Kotero changed
his name to Carter...

24:47.376 --> 24:51.073
and fronts his mob activities
by selling expensive yachts.

24:51.180 --> 24:53.808
Wait a minute.
My father knew a man
named Kotero.

24:53.883 --> 24:55.748
He went to prison
20 years ago.

24:55.818 --> 24:57.308
l saw this old guy below deck.

24:57.386 --> 25:00.219
He looked like somebody
out of Dick Tracy's
10 most wanted list.

25:00.289 --> 25:01.517
Sonny's father maybe?

25:01.591 --> 25:03.252
That would explain
the nom de Neptune.

25:03.326 --> 25:04.554
According to
the county records...

25:04.627 --> 25:06.754
your father bought this place
about 20 years ago.

25:06.829 --> 25:07.955
l don't see the connection.

25:08.030 --> 25:09.964
These dudes must have
been running together.

25:10.032 --> 25:12.125
Miss Gordon, aside
from being a referee...

25:12.201 --> 25:14.066
what else did your father
do for a living?

25:14.537 --> 25:16.505
Louie bounced from job to job.

25:16.572 --> 25:17.971
He sold shoes.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.905
He even owned a newsstand
for a while.

25:20.576 --> 25:22.601
Face, l want you to go down
to the Federal Building...

25:22.678 --> 25:24.942
check the FBl records
on Papa Kotero.

25:25.414 --> 25:29.077
Sure, no problem,
l'll just walk in there,
flash my library card....

25:29.151 --> 25:31.642
And your smile.
Yeah.

25:38.561 --> 25:40.358
[people chattering]

25:56.145 --> 25:57.134
[sighing]

26:01.050 --> 26:02.278
Excuse me.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.851
Hey, Cole.

26:06.222 --> 26:08.247
How are you doing?
Pretty good.

26:09.158 --> 26:11.956
l tell you, that Musgrave case
is a bear.

26:12.061 --> 26:15.519
They got you on that too,
Deberg?
For two months now.

26:17.533 --> 26:21.162
Yeah. Man, l'm glad they
kept me away from that one.

26:21.704 --> 26:24.571
This Musgrave must have
stashed a fortune.

26:34.517 --> 26:37.509
Boy, this Musgrave case
is killing me.

26:37.586 --> 26:38.951
You too, huh?

26:39.021 --> 26:41.581
Yeah, they've got
half the guys in the Bureau
after this guy...

26:41.657 --> 26:43.147
but we'll catch him.

26:43.259 --> 26:45.693
Catch him? They arrested him
a week ago.

26:45.761 --> 26:47.285
Did l say catch him?

26:47.363 --> 26:49.388
[laughing]
l meant convict him.

26:49.532 --> 26:53.696
Yeah, he brought in
some hotshot lawyer
from Back East, you know....

26:54.003 --> 26:57.734
Yeah, so the D.A.'s got us
doing all this legwork.

26:57.807 --> 26:59.331
lt'll take months
to build that case.

26:59.408 --> 27:02.241
You know, l've had the D.A.
in here twice already,
combing the files.

27:02.311 --> 27:04.336
Yeah, well,
that's why l'm here.

27:04.747 --> 27:09.707
lt seems this Musgrave
was connected to an old case
dating back 25 years.

27:09.985 --> 27:11.577
Twenty-five years.

27:11.721 --> 27:13.188
He would have been
in sixth grade.

27:13.255 --> 27:16.053
Fifth grade.
Well, it wasn't him.
See, it was his uncle.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.717
Guy by the name of....

27:18.561 --> 27:19.789
Memory's a little....

27:20.096 --> 27:21.222
Let's see, uh...

27:21.297 --> 27:25.393
Kotero, that's K-O-T-E-R-O.

27:25.468 --> 27:27.868
Well, anyway,
they sent me down here
to pull his file...

27:27.937 --> 27:30.804
and, boy,
are they grasping
at straws.

27:30.873 --> 27:31.931
Kotero.

27:32.007 --> 27:36.501
One entry listed in the period
between 1955 and 1960.
A Victor L.

27:36.579 --> 27:38.376
Kotero was arrested
seven times.

27:38.447 --> 27:40.176
He was only convicted
of one crime...

27:40.249 --> 27:42.945
but it was a doozie.

27:43.018 --> 27:46.351
Kotero was involved
in armed car robbery in 1958.

27:46.422 --> 27:48.822
There were two guards,
one of them was killed.

27:48.891 --> 27:50.222
They never found the money.

27:50.292 --> 27:53.090
And the government agent
on the case was Thomas McKeon.

27:53.162 --> 27:55.255
He finally caught up
with Papa Kotero.

27:55.531 --> 27:57.658
Kotero went up the river
for 30 years.

27:57.733 --> 27:59.132
But about a year later...

27:59.201 --> 28:01.897
McKeon was pancaked
by a city bus.

28:01.971 --> 28:03.939
My father was an armed guard
for a while.

28:04.006 --> 28:06.941
According to the reports,
he was the other guard...

28:07.009 --> 28:08.806
on the truck,
the day of the robbery.

28:08.878 --> 28:11.039
Dicki, l don't like
to say this, but...

28:11.113 --> 28:12.876
we've got to
consider the possibility...

28:12.948 --> 28:15.178
that your father was in this
with Papa Kotero.

28:15.351 --> 28:16.978
And when Kotero was caught...

28:17.386 --> 28:20.116
he took the fall
and left your father
to hide the loot.

28:21.490 --> 28:23.549
Sometimes when you dig
into someone's past...

28:23.626 --> 28:27.892
what you find out
can alter the illusion
of the memory.

28:28.330 --> 28:32.391
Hey, look. My father
was my best friend
when l was a kid.

28:32.935 --> 28:35.062
He always wanted a boy,
but my mother passed away...

28:35.137 --> 28:36.798
before they could
get that going.

28:36.872 --> 28:40.831
But still there was
baseball games,
ice cream at the pier...

28:40.910 --> 28:44.038
and those days when we'd work
on the ''atomic body slam.''

28:44.180 --> 28:48.378
But l'm a big guy now,
as Louie would say, and...

28:48.717 --> 28:52.881
as far as l know my father
could have been
a Dillinger or something.

28:53.689 --> 28:55.281
But to me...

28:55.357 --> 28:58.588
to me he was Papa.

28:58.661 --> 29:00.925
Well, what exactly
was in the armored car?

29:00.996 --> 29:02.861
This is the exciting part.

29:03.432 --> 29:06.230
lt was a gold transfer.
15 bars.

29:06.302 --> 29:08.327
Ten pounds apiece?
(Face)
Exactly.

29:08.404 --> 29:12.170
And at $32 an ounce,
in 1958...

29:12.241 --> 29:17.201
we're looking
at $76,800 dollars.

29:17.780 --> 29:20.374
But today, you know,
it's worth...

29:20.449 --> 29:25.148
320 in Hong Kong,
31 7 in London.

29:25.221 --> 29:26.745
What exactly
is the load worth?

29:26.922 --> 29:30.881
$768,480.

29:31.060 --> 29:34.188
And we are probably
standing on it.

29:35.431 --> 29:39.629
Yeah, this was
a vacant lot until 1962.

29:39.702 --> 29:43.069
So this center is sitting
on Papa Kotero's pension fund.

29:43.172 --> 29:46.164
And he's ready to collect,
as soon as he get ahold
of this place.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.710
Yeah, buy it and bulldoze it.

29:48.944 --> 29:50.673
What's the plan, Hannibal?

29:51.046 --> 29:53.514
We go to Papa Kotero
and we say...

29:53.949 --> 29:55.314
''Where did you hide it?''

30:36.592 --> 30:39.993
Hey, anybody
aboard this ship?
That's not the way to do it.

30:40.629 --> 30:41.721
FBl.

30:43.566 --> 30:45.431
l mean.... Wait, wait.

30:48.537 --> 30:50.437
Hey, hold it right there.

30:50.506 --> 30:51.768
[grunting]

30:54.109 --> 30:56.077
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Mr. McKeon...

30:56.145 --> 30:59.546
you can't just run roughshod
over these people like this.

30:59.615 --> 31:02.778
What the heck is--
Kotero,
it's been a long time.

31:03.018 --> 31:06.044
l'm Sean McKeon,
FBl, Long Beach.

31:06.155 --> 31:08.589
This is William Deberg,
Los Angeles FBl.

31:08.657 --> 31:10.318
l'm here to finish
my brother's business.

31:10.392 --> 31:12.587
Now Mr. McKeon,
could we proceed...

31:12.661 --> 31:14.891
within the boundaries
of the Bureau's regulations?

31:14.964 --> 31:16.693
These people have rights,
you know.

31:16.832 --> 31:18.595
Scum like this
have got no rights.

31:18.667 --> 31:20.157
What the heck's
going on here?

31:20.235 --> 31:21.702
They're FBl agents.

31:22.104 --> 31:25.130
This one here is the brother
of the guy who set me up.

31:25.541 --> 31:28.533
FBl agents, huh?
Let me see some lD.

31:32.948 --> 31:34.472
What's the main number
on Wilshire?

31:34.550 --> 31:36.711
555-5000.

31:36.785 --> 31:39.219
Listen, l've got to apologize
for Agent McKeon, there.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.552
You know, some of the guys
at the Bureau,
you know, they....

31:41.690 --> 31:45.751
Yeah, do you have an agent
William Deberg assigned
to your office.

31:46.061 --> 31:48.359
Yeah, may l
talk to him please?

31:48.564 --> 31:51.192
He's out in the field, huh?
Thank you.

31:51.700 --> 31:53.327
l want this man
off the boat.

31:53.402 --> 31:54.801
Not until
we've had a little chat.

31:54.870 --> 31:56.565
Just give me five minutes
alone with this guy.

31:56.639 --> 31:59.073
Oh, no, l don't think
that would be appropriate.

31:59.141 --> 32:01.439
Kid, l got 30 years
seniority on you.

32:01.510 --> 32:03.478
Now leave us alone,
l'm ordering you.

32:03.545 --> 32:06.105
Anything you have to
say to my father,
you can say in front of me.

32:06.181 --> 32:09.514
l've got no trouble
talking to two lowlifes
at the same time.

32:09.752 --> 32:10.980
No gun.

32:11.353 --> 32:14.379
Look, your request
is within the limits
of procedure, so...

32:14.556 --> 32:17.423
would you promise me
you won't violate
these men's rights?

32:17.493 --> 32:20.291
Sure.
All right, you, you,
come with me, outside.

32:20.362 --> 32:22.125
Come on, move, move!

32:27.002 --> 32:29.630
(Kotero)
l see you're just as charming
as your brother.

32:29.705 --> 32:30.763
Leave him out of this.

32:30.839 --> 32:33.205
What the hell
do you want?
l want half the gold.

32:33.275 --> 32:35.243
Your brother was
a straight shooter.

32:35.310 --> 32:38.473
l tried to buy him off
and that sucker sent me
to the can.

32:38.547 --> 32:40.481
My brother died
without a dime.

32:40.549 --> 32:43.541
l've been waiting 20 years
for you to make me rich.

32:43.752 --> 32:45.879
Sorry for the inconvenience.

32:45.954 --> 32:47.751
l've got a proposition
for you.

32:47.823 --> 32:48.881
Take it or leave it.

32:49.124 --> 32:51.354
We go to Louie Gordon's,
we dig up the gold...

32:51.427 --> 32:52.416
[gun cocking]

32:52.561 --> 32:53.755
and l'll let you live.

32:53.829 --> 32:56.229
What makes you think that
that's where it's buried?

32:56.298 --> 32:58.493
Sonny's been
sniffing around for weeks.

32:58.567 --> 33:00.592
Might as well put up
a billboard, pal.

33:00.669 --> 33:02.296
All right. Okay.

33:02.838 --> 33:04.100
How do you plan to work this?

33:04.173 --> 33:05.834
l'll make it
official business.

33:06.175 --> 33:08.234
We go in. We dig up the gold.

33:08.310 --> 33:11.211
l take it out in
a government vehicle
and we split it afterwards.

33:11.346 --> 33:13.041
How do we know
we can trust you?

33:13.148 --> 33:15.742
Because you'll be with me
all the time.

33:18.987 --> 33:20.420
[birds chirping]

33:22.324 --> 33:23.757
Federal Agent.

33:24.026 --> 33:26.221
Sean McKeon, notifying you...

33:26.295 --> 33:28.923
that under section 198
of the McLaren Act...

33:28.997 --> 33:33.559
you are hereby ordered
to yield for a search
for evidence on your property.

33:34.169 --> 33:35.534
Which way is it?

33:36.338 --> 33:37.498
Let's go.

33:37.573 --> 33:39.541
Hey, man,
you can dig your own hole.

33:39.608 --> 33:42.099
l didn't sign up for prison
to do no ditch digging.

33:42.311 --> 33:44.404
How about l dig the hole
and leave you in it.

33:44.513 --> 33:46.640
All right,
l'll dig a hole.

33:47.983 --> 33:49.848
This is one tough guy.

34:00.062 --> 34:02.462
Break, boss?
Sir.

34:04.199 --> 34:06.064
Break, sir?

34:06.135 --> 34:07.124
No.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.902
Water, sir?

34:18.013 --> 34:19.241
No, l ain't thirsty.

34:23.585 --> 34:25.780
Metal box, boss man.

34:26.588 --> 34:27.987
Pick it up.

35:00.088 --> 35:01.453
Open it up.

35:04.860 --> 35:06.418
[box lid creaking]

35:08.564 --> 35:09.963
[Murdock grunting]

35:12.167 --> 35:13.191
(B.A.)
lt's empty.

35:13.268 --> 35:16.032
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
There's a letter inside.

35:16.171 --> 35:18.401
ls there a Victor Kotero here?

35:23.912 --> 35:27.245
''Kotero, right property,
wrong spot.''

35:27.683 --> 35:31.642
''l moved it.''
Signed, Louie Gordon.

35:31.954 --> 35:34.388
[siren wailing]
September, 1969.

35:34.456 --> 35:35.889
[tires screeching]

35:43.432 --> 35:45.332
End of the line, Smith.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.798
Peck lifted
the wrong lD this time.

35:47.870 --> 35:49.462
What's going on?

35:49.805 --> 35:52.103
Who are you?
My name is Hannibal Smith...

35:52.174 --> 35:55.268
and if l were you,
l'd all hit the ground, now!

36:07.923 --> 36:09.720
(Decker)
The A-Team
is making an escape.

36:09.791 --> 36:11.520
Don't let them get away.

36:16.732 --> 36:18.256
Not bad, huh, guys?

36:24.373 --> 36:26.933
No way out this time, Smith.

36:38.587 --> 36:39.952
We hit right before
the main event.

36:40.022 --> 36:42.217
Everyone's inside,
all the money's
in the box office.

36:42.291 --> 36:45.852
That rotten crumb took my land
and then he moves
the gold away.

36:45.928 --> 36:48.920
We hit hard, we hit fast,
and make sure
we clean them out good.

36:48.997 --> 36:51.363
Now this monster wrestler
is gonna be paying the rent...

36:51.433 --> 36:53.162
and buying
the little squealers jerseys.

36:53.235 --> 36:55.897
They ain't gonna
get the money. We got
everything under control.

36:55.971 --> 36:57.063
And then once
we get the property...

36:57.139 --> 36:59.334
we can bulldoze
the whole place
if we have to.

36:59.441 --> 37:00.874
l told you, Papa...

37:01.009 --> 37:04.035
you want that stash,
l'm gonna get it for you.

37:04.112 --> 37:06.740
At least this A-Team's
out of the way.

37:07.449 --> 37:11.385
They won't see
the light of day
for 20 years.

37:16.792 --> 37:18.521
l can't believe B.A.
got captured.

37:18.593 --> 37:20.288
l should have never
called on you guys.

37:20.362 --> 37:23.354
lt's not your fault. l'm gonna
get them guys out of there.
So don't worry about it.

37:23.432 --> 37:25.332
How am l gonna wrestle
with this on my mind?

37:25.400 --> 37:27.493
You just gotta concentrate
on the match, Hulkster.

37:27.569 --> 37:30.367
That's exactly what
the big guy would say to you,
if he was here.

37:30.439 --> 37:32.805
l'm gonna be thinking
about you guys
while l'm in the ring.

37:32.874 --> 37:34.171
As a matter of fact...

37:34.242 --> 37:37.905
when l look at my opponent,
l'm gonna be seeing
Sonny Carter.

37:37.980 --> 37:40.540
lt's gonna be
a pretty quick bout then.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.414
Do you know what you're doing?

37:42.484 --> 37:45.783
Actually, it's never worked
but might as well
give it a try.

37:45.954 --> 37:49.219
Mr. Deberg, l want these men
turned over to me immediately.

37:49.291 --> 37:51.759
Hey, pal, the FBl
nailed these guys.

37:51.827 --> 37:53.692
These men are
military fugitives.

37:53.762 --> 37:56.287
That were apprehended
by the FBl.

37:56.365 --> 37:58.856
The Army's been chasing them
for 10 years.

37:58.934 --> 38:01.129
And we been chasing them
for 10 minutes.

38:01.203 --> 38:02.192
And we're gonna hold them.

38:02.270 --> 38:04.898
l want them transferred
to a military prison.

38:04.973 --> 38:06.440
Forget it.
Forget it?

38:06.541 --> 38:08.270
Look, Colonel,
l called you into this thing.

38:08.377 --> 38:10.937
They came into
a federal building.
They filched my badge.

38:11.013 --> 38:12.310
l took you to them.

38:12.381 --> 38:16.442
They were impersonating
federal officers and they
were captured by the FBl.

38:16.718 --> 38:17.946
This is my bust.

38:18.020 --> 38:20.215
They're not moving till
the Deputy Bureau Chief...

38:20.288 --> 38:21.585
gets here
and makes a decision.

38:21.656 --> 38:24.181
l'll call the Pentagon
if l have to.

38:24.459 --> 38:29.396
You'll spend the next 10 years
chasing stolen cars
in Natchez, Mississippi.

38:29.564 --> 38:31.532
They're staying right here.

38:39.608 --> 38:40.973
(soldier)
Ten-hut.

38:41.676 --> 38:43.337
At ease, soldiers.

38:43.678 --> 38:45.839
The three of you
will accompany me
into this building.

38:45.914 --> 38:48.246
We're moving the A-Team.
But first remove your weapons.

38:48.316 --> 38:50.443
There are to be no firearms
brought into this facility...

38:50.519 --> 38:52.510
as long as the A-Team
is present.
ls that understood?

38:52.587 --> 38:54.953
But, sir, we're never supposed
to leave our weapons.

38:55.023 --> 38:57.184
Are you supposed to question
your commanding officer?

38:57.259 --> 39:00.285
No, sir, but--
No buts about it, soldier!

39:04.699 --> 39:08.294
Now, you'll get these back
when you learn
to follow orders.

39:08.370 --> 39:10.565
Put those weapons
in the front of this cabin.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.971
Yes, sir.
Weapons into the van.

39:25.821 --> 39:28.221
General Hagen.
These are release
and transportation papers.

39:28.290 --> 39:30.349
We're moving the A-Team
to the base at Point Marcos.

39:30.425 --> 39:32.154
But, sir, we have orders
from Colonel Decker.

39:32.227 --> 39:34.457
What do you think l am,
a fool, Sergeant?

39:34.529 --> 39:37.555
You see these stripes?
They used to belong
to that soldier there.

39:37.632 --> 39:40.624
Do you wish to join him
in the lower ranks?
No, sir!

39:40.702 --> 39:43.262
Colonel Decker is aware
of the move.

39:43.705 --> 39:45.002
Yes, sir.

39:48.810 --> 39:51.973
So this is the A-Team.
l'm not impressed.

39:59.187 --> 40:01.712
Okay, soldiers,
follow me back here.

40:03.825 --> 40:05.850
Move it. Move it.
Move it.

40:20.075 --> 40:22.600
Attention.
Sergeant, at ease.

40:28.483 --> 40:29.507
Where are they?

40:29.584 --> 40:31.415
They were released
to the General, sir.

40:31.653 --> 40:33.120
What General?

40:42.931 --> 40:44.796
They're staying here, huh?

40:44.900 --> 40:45.889
Cheers.

40:47.169 --> 40:48.727
(ring announcer)
Mean Gene Okerlund...

40:48.803 --> 40:50.100
at the Los Angeles
Sports Arena.

40:50.172 --> 40:52.436
Greg ''the Hammer'' Valentine
meeting Hulk Hogan...

40:52.507 --> 40:55.203
and Valentine immediately
attacks the Hulkster.

40:55.277 --> 40:58.804
Cored his head
into the turnbuckle,
but Hulk holds on.

40:59.414 --> 41:01.006
[crowd cheering]

41:03.118 --> 41:05.313
And the Hulkster with a right,
and another left.

41:05.387 --> 41:07.287
Another left and yet another.

41:08.023 --> 41:10.491
And a right,
and he stuns Valentine.

41:10.559 --> 41:12.652
Valentine to the mat
but he's back up.

41:20.669 --> 41:23.035
Sorry, gentlemen,
it's a sellout.

41:23.271 --> 41:24.363
[guns firing]

41:25.340 --> 41:26.932
[sirens wailing]

41:40.188 --> 41:42.656
(ring announcer)
Greg Valentine has got him
in a hold right now.

41:42.724 --> 41:44.715
This is a possible
submission hold.

41:44.793 --> 41:47.990
You know, the Hulkster
just doesn't look
like himself tonight.

41:48.063 --> 41:51.191
I don't know what it is.
He seems to be distracted
by something.

41:51.266 --> 41:53.291
He came out fighting
earlier on...

41:53.401 --> 41:54.993
but now
Valentine has got him...

41:55.270 --> 41:58.000
in that submission hold.
He's down on the mat.

41:58.073 --> 42:01.133
Valentine, if he
wins this match,
will become...

42:01.209 --> 42:04.144
the new
World Wrestling Federation's
Heavyweight Champion.

42:04.212 --> 42:07.773
And I'll tell you
the Hulkster looks completely
without concentration.

42:07.849 --> 42:10.409
He's lost
his mental concentration.

42:11.353 --> 42:13.378
The referee
is lifting up his hand...

42:13.455 --> 42:14.979
and it drops
totally limp.

42:15.056 --> 42:18.253
He lifts it again
and again that hand
drops limp.

42:19.060 --> 42:21.756
Could Greg ''the Hammer''
Valentine have him here?

42:22.030 --> 42:23.964
He lifts the hand
one more time and....

42:24.032 --> 42:25.056
Wait a minute.

42:25.133 --> 42:26.828
There's the number one finger.

42:26.901 --> 42:29.529
Known throughout the world
for the Hulkster.

42:29.604 --> 42:31.765
There is still life
to this big man.

42:44.886 --> 42:46.478
[crowd cheering]

43:07.208 --> 43:08.903
[banging on door]

43:09.210 --> 43:13.613
And Valentine has Hogan
on the mat. He's pounding him
with a series of rights.

43:14.249 --> 43:15.739
Hogan is mad.

43:16.618 --> 43:19.348
Valentine,
stepping out of the ring now.

43:21.623 --> 43:23.955
Valentine climbing up
on top of the ropes.

43:24.025 --> 43:26.152
He's gonna make a leap
onto the Hulkster.

43:47.615 --> 43:49.242
Watch out, though.

43:50.151 --> 43:51.778
1, 2, 3.

43:51.853 --> 43:52.842
[bell dings]

43:52.954 --> 43:54.478
[crowd cheering]
Hogan successfully defends...

43:54.556 --> 43:56.023
the World Wrestling
Federation's...

43:56.091 --> 43:59.424
heavyweight title
here at the
Los Angeles Sports Arena...

43:59.494 --> 44:03.726
in front of another
World Wrestling Federation
capacity crowd.

44:04.666 --> 44:08.227
Fans are on their feet.
They are excited.

44:08.570 --> 44:10.902
This is excitement
personified.

44:11.239 --> 44:13.036
Oh, my, what's this?

44:13.108 --> 44:14.939
Come on, man,
they just hit
the box office.

44:15.009 --> 44:18.035
A stranger has jumped
into the ring and Hulk Hogan
is now leaving...

44:18.113 --> 44:19.410
running up the aisle.

44:19.481 --> 44:22.882
I believe we saw
that gentleman
down in San Diego recently.

44:26.988 --> 44:29.149
Give me the money. Let's go.

44:34.763 --> 44:37.459
Back inside, guys.
These dudes are ours, B.A.

44:53.515 --> 44:54.880
[groaning]

44:59.587 --> 45:00.576
[groaning]

45:00.688 --> 45:02.019
[grunting]

45:18.273 --> 45:22.505
Hey, Hulk, is there
such a thing as
a five-man tag team?

45:28.716 --> 45:30.741
Well, as soon as Hannibal
and Murdock get back...

45:30.819 --> 45:32.081
from getting
the van fixed...

45:32.153 --> 45:34.383
l think we shall set sail.

45:34.556 --> 45:37.286
They're never gonna find you
once you're out on that boat.

45:37.425 --> 45:39.985
Yeah, l hear the owner's
pretty much indisposed.

45:40.061 --> 45:44.088
l think we'll take her out
to Catalina and then
down south to Mexico.

45:44.666 --> 45:48.261
By the time Carter
gets released, he can whistle
for the first payment.

45:48.403 --> 45:50.303
Am l invited?
Absolutely.

45:50.371 --> 45:52.635
Cause we're gonna be
digging up the center
for the next week.

45:52.707 --> 45:55.267
Yeah, that's what
l hate worst part
about the Feds.

45:55.343 --> 45:56.970
They always want
what's theirs.

45:57.045 --> 45:59.172
Between the reward
from the government
and the money...

45:59.247 --> 46:01.875
that the Hulkster
and the WWF have raised.

46:01.950 --> 46:05.010
l think we're gonna be
in business for quite a while.

46:05.086 --> 46:08.055
My pleasure, Dicki.
Thanks a lot, Hulks.

46:11.860 --> 46:15.193
Say, have you ever seen
the rest of this ship?

46:16.064 --> 46:17.361
No, l haven't.

46:17.432 --> 46:19.593
Shall we?
Okay.

46:19.667 --> 46:22.363
Hey, Faceman,
she's like a sister to me.

46:22.437 --> 46:25.497
l shall be
on my very best behavior.

46:29.911 --> 46:32.277
l'd like to thank you again,
B.A., for helping me out, man.

46:32.347 --> 46:33.974
No thanks needed, brother.

46:34.048 --> 46:37.279
No, l really mean it.
l think there's something else
l should tell you.

46:37.352 --> 46:38.478
What's that?

46:38.586 --> 46:41.953
Well, remember when
you asked me if there was
anything l was afraid of....

46:42.090 --> 46:45.321
l knew it. l knew it.
l knew there was something.
What is it?

46:45.460 --> 46:47.257
Well, it's the part
about the water.

46:47.362 --> 46:49.353
You're afraid
of the water?

46:49.497 --> 46:52.364
No, l'm afraid of
what happens to me
when l get around the water.

46:52.433 --> 46:53.900
l like to throw people in.

46:53.968 --> 46:55.833
Forget it, man.
l ain't going in.

46:55.904 --> 46:57.735
You held out on me.

46:57.805 --> 46:59.067
You're the one
that's gonna pay!

46:59.140 --> 47:01.131
You're going in.
You're going in!

47:01.309 --> 47:02.867
[both grunting]

47:06.114 --> 47:09.015
Oh, man. Forget it.

47:09.083 --> 47:10.072
[both laughing]

47:10.218 --> 47:11.480
[both grunting]

47:11.953 --> 47:13.420
[bell dinging]
